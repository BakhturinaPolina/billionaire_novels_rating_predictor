LT_Swan,The Casanova,24,"“Do you mean the deal about you not being seen or photographed with me but it’s perfectly fine for you to be seen leaving with another woman, or do you mean your deal of nobody knowing about us and you speaking to me like a piece of crap whenever you feel like it?"

Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,5,I hate how she’s become the object of men’s desires.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,23,"Whether that’s a wall of frozen yogurt in the break room for morale, an ear to listen while they vent about a coworker or a project hitch, or a suggestion of which part of the real estate world we should conquer next—expanding from just office buildings to hotels, spas, and wineries was my idea, but implemented by my staff until they needed someone at the VP level to sign off—I’ve basically been the person making sure they all have what they need to get their jobs done."

Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,I moved too fast.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,50,He couldn’t have revealed himself so clearly there.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,2,"Can't recall ever using it myself though."""
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,12,"Maybe that’s all this will be with us, too, but it feels like it could be
something more."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,40,"“You noticed?” “I notice everything about you,” I told her and meant it."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,8,I’m taken aback.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,29,He licks the cold champagne off the curve of my breast.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,9,She shouldn’t be childish by taking his actions so personally.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,30,“Go on.” “Reid and Alex.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,16,"So infatuated with the cut of the dress and curve of her hips, he noticed belatedly, that she was carrying a very large frame."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,1,I want to.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,21,I convinced myself it happened because I didn’t want her.” “Of course it didn’t happen because of that.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,6,You’ll be at a million followers in no time!
LJ_Shen,The Monster,17,She nodded enthusiastically.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,2,"He was by far the sexiest man in the room, with his custom tuxedo and piercing blue eyes."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,52,“It’s Windsor property now.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,5,"Her eyes widen, and a humorless smile tugs at my lips as my palms slide down to her thighs."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,6,"""I've already set up the dinner meeting for …"" ""You're setting us up for scandal."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,15,"It swings open moments later, and something akin to envy washes over me."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,17,My eyes flick to his father and mother as they look on as well.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,33,“I was just being clumsy.
Katy_Evans,Mogul,6,“Do you want to call back to verify?
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,16,"For years, I couldn’t stand to hear the sound of a piano, because it reminded me of my mother, and that, in turn, triggered the guilt I have yet to overcome."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,3,"He glanced at her, those green eyes of his pinning her to the soft leather seat more effectively than his actual touch would."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,10,"I smile at him, but he remains serious, almost ."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,6,“It isn’t that.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,35,It’s why the whole family stayed longer than they should’ve at the house in Albany.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,9,"But…if you get another ride home, that’s okay, too,” Kimber said boldly."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,14,"Even in his youth, he would have been coached for this role."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,5,"Okay, here goes."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,14,I guess I could pull out?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,32,She nods.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,36,"In the elevator, on the communications floor, down in the sleek and elegant lobby, just these strange looks."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,17,.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,4,No one over there knows what they’re doing—not like you do.” Taylor grinned.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,10,It was a mixture of nausea and dread with some anger thrown into the mix.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,35,She wasn’t giving me the privilege of taking care of her much anymore.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,23,"Meeting over, workday hoopla handled, he invited Reese to racquetball."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,25,"“Vanilla with rainbow sprinkles, Mommy?” “Uncle Remy said you can pick out whatever kind of ice cream you want,” I fibbed."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,28,"If I’d known, I’d have been more careful.” She wraps her arms around herself and stares at the floor."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,15,"She was team leader for this project, in charge of five other scientists."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,55,"Victoria An hour later, I watch as Saint eases his Jeep into the deserted parking lot."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,19,"“I’m perfect,” she answers with a sated smile."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,13,"Do you regret being pulled away from Italy and the new career you wanted to launch?” “I regret the circumstances,” she said honestly."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,10,And then the kiss on the sidewalk.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,21,My chest tightens with the force of a vise grip.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,44,I donâ€™t need photos for that.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,34,I’m already standing when I answer.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,28,"When I had to wait a whole hour at the floral boutique for him, my hope for the day disintegrated."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,25,"“My hair looks like singed pubes, so you either take me to a fucking bar, or that’s it ."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,7,"“Definitely,” she added a bit breathlessly."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,26,I catalogued her every movement and the way her eyes weren’t on fire anymore but instead had embers of pleasure and satiation burning there when she opened them.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,11,"""Well, Mr. Delaware,
now don't get offended but I don't think Abbey was all that interested in
you."""
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,8,Had he ever called her a nerd?
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,12,Crying over dead goldfish and those Morris the Cat commercials where he’s lost and his owner’s looking for him in the rain.” My reply came out muffled.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,5,Eventually Amanda’s laundry was ready.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,25,"Maybe it’s the memory of that loss that makes all of this so scary, so terrifying to feel the way you do."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,15,"I replied with Pink: ‘You took my hand, you showed me how."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,4,“Can I see a picture of their kitten beds?” Evie asked innocently.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,He belonged to me absolutely .
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,37,Saint in casual wear is even more potent than Saint in office clothes.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,33,“You’re extraordinary.”
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,1,I couldn’t be happy—not with him or anyone.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,37,"I hadn’t told him I’d destroyed the photos yet, partly because I’d been distracted, and partly because they kept him in check."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,8,"“With this filing, we have officially linked Stoneface to an individual known as the Red Ribbon Killer,” said Matthew Price, Brooklyn County district attorney."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,3,"wind laced with ozone, dry grass, something sweet like freshly cut wood."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,6,I stiffen.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,22,My mouth goes dry.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,8,The coffee he was drinking churned in his gut.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,8,"Miraculously, her unique items had caught on, and she sold enough to make a living, never really needing to touch the money Travis sent."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,25,"He’s calmer, somehow."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,38,"“Oh, yeah, I’m so looking forward to that.” Sutton got Jason into bed before coming back out to the living room."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,17,Hello!” She broke into a smile.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,22,"“It’s so beautiful,” she whispers."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,24,"It’s a couple of college kids, phones in hand."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,6,“Tina?” he asked.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,2,Kathryn Landon.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,3,"Breathing a sigh of relief, Sam deposited Maddie’s cuddly body into the seat."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,26,"“This isn’t my home,” she says, looking exhausted."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,20,Can’t we take a break?” “And where do you suppose we take a break?” “Outside.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,No longer a woman.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,12,“I wanted to pave my own way.” She dropped her chin on her fist.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,12,"Apparently, my run had come to an end."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,2,He wasn’t above admitting that evening the scales for his failures was a big part of what drove his actions now.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,30,"I’m at the top of my professional field, working as a judge."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,9,"Oh, wait."""
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,5,"He turns on the water, takes my hand and holds it under the tap."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,10,"Seeing that he didn’t want to talk about it, I dragged him back to the former topic."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,43,"“Nothing like what you share with Hannah.” His hands move around my waist, and he tightens his grip."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,11,"Going to the bathroom, I take out the red lip stain I bought a long time ago."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,13,I don’t want to get a few months in and find out we aren’t on the same page.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,"I was tempted to tell him not to be such a smart-ass, but remembering my rule about no swearing in front of Carrington, I kept silent."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,"As Cassie and Georgia giggled their way back into the suite, I couldn’t take my eyes off my best friend."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,23,"Was it my stellar advice?” “Your suggestions did help,” I admitted."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,9,God-fuckin’-damn.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,11,"Doctor’s
orders you’re to take it easy.” “So?"
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,19,"And maybe after a few days apart, I’ll be able to think more clearly.” She shrugged."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,17,"Some nights he gets all quiet and broody, but we can never tell if it’s the game or if he’s busy reinventing the Internet in that big brain of his."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,31,"Even if he had done it before, I still worried."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,7,"“Here you go,” Derek said, as he passed his information through the window."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,5,"I’m a fighter, and I can see you are as well.” “Karen, too."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,2,"I sip my drink, equally fascinated with his story."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,15,I pull back to stare at him.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,17,He arrived too quickly to have been summoned by André.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,36,“You can’t just leave.” “It was always going to happen.” She looks around.
Emma_Bray,Unmasking the Billionaire,1,“What?” my brows furrow at her melodramatic reaction.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,19,"And here we were, in the back of the art studio, with no time at all, and I was getting fucked in both holes."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,10,"“You have no idea.” I pouted, glancing behind us, as if I could grab one last glance."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,19,"“If you could just see yourself.” He smirks, and then a crash of lightning hits so close it sounds like it hit a tree right next to us."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,17,And this contract?” He holds it up like it’s a trophy.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,42,"""Weston fucking a-hole Kincaid,"" I growl into the phone."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,15,"He looked down to turn the tap on, a small smile on his face."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,3,"With a murmur, he took my wrists and drew them around his shoulders."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,21,“I can’t stay here.” “Stay here every night you like.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,37,"“I
will tomorrow,” I spoke as I walked away and went up to my room."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,35,"I take it, pull out a lighter from my pocket, and flick it on."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,21,"I’d studied cases and at dinner, I’d tell my
parents about what I learned."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,26,"“Lying right there?” I nod, still breathless."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,40,“Where the fuck is my life?” My eyes fill with tears at his anger.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,5,"“But if she starts spilling the news right now, we might be swamped with people trying to get the scoop.” Her eyes met mine, a little panicked."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,1,"More than the norm, always the first."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,41,Are you seeing him?” I grit my teeth for a moment as I try to decide how to answer him.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,3,“And feeding you is now part of my job.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,15,"They were holding it over Reese’s head, which was abhorrent, but on the bright side, their indecision gave her time."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,13,Austin shook his head at me.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,33,How does one go about that?” Lilah asked and then picked at a fuzz on the dress.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,10,"When he returned a moment later, he moved back to her side and began to lightly kiss her mouth, his thumb stroking her cheek."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,38,He took drinking very seriously.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,1,Only when my heel sinks into the ground do I realize that I've placed my stilettos squarely in his footstep.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,7,"As long as I can make you come, I’ll be ecstatic.” She sighed, her body relaxing."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,17,"I hate knowing that I played a role in the pain she's feeling, and it kills me to know that from here on out, I will only break her heart more."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,1,"He guffaws, a sound so annoying that my molars grind together."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,9,"Her job as Adonis’s caregiver would end, and then she’d be gone."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,23,“Aren’t you even going to ask where we’re going?” “Nope.” She turned around and beat feet toward the stairs.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,10,“Come on.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,2,"How was the drive?” “Oh, fine."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,20,He pats the thick carpeted runner beside him .
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,20,Don’t be too shocked if Doulie ends up in the adjoining room when you go to Ottawa tomorrow morning.” Ari almost swallowed the wedge of lime she was sucking on.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,6,“No.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,3,Or will he only see what he sees every day in the mirror?
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,20,“Why should I be careful?
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,Hardy had shown me his apartment earlier in the evening—I had opted to meet him there rather than have him pick me up at River Oaks.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,31,I thought she and I were on the verge of becoming something more.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,51,"“She paints?” “Oh, just mucking around, she definitely doesn’t see herself as an artist."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,11,"“I can
stay if you’d like,” he spoke."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,42,“Hi.” I smile over at him.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,6,"“Camilla’s a good girl, but she’s just business."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,"“Don’t you dare raise your voice at me, you promiscuous piece of shit!"
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,47,A smile stretches across my face as I kiss Daisy on the forehead.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,15,I was ravaged.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,33,"Come home, and I’ll tell you everything."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,44,Not when there was someone else I’d much rather spend my time with.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,26,My phone rang.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,3,I think It’s a Wonderful Life is on at nine.” He scowled at her obvious attempt to ignore his advice.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,28,My dad got the strip of condoms.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,4,She rapped on the glass separating her and the cabbie and gave him a different address.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,29,"“When I was sure ,” Lauren sputtered."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,13,"In the haze of my peripheral vision, I could see other couples head in the direction we’d just come, and amongst the shuffle and swing of their active bodies, our lip-locked, fully intertwined ones would have been even more obvious."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,6,Rachel’s pinked cheeks went ruddy as she narrowed her eyes at him.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,26,"I yank her close, press my lips to hers."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,5,"I stand and stretch, ready to call it a night."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,34,"She sucks on it, swallows."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,26,You need to practice before you get there.” I put my hand over my mouth.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,20,Sasha clicks off.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,2,“Go get the bun stuff.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,25,"“You’re okay.” His lips search mine in the dark, and he kisses me."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,19,"Is that all, Renata?"
LJ_Shen,The Monster,5,Maybe women who had to get hush-hush abortions?” Sam always called my dad Gerry.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,10,You wouldn't respect me as an equal if you thought I couldn't handle myself.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,18,a regular penis.” That makes his face fall in disbelief.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,3,I just started cooking.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,10,"His father had been a tough buzzard, too."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,44,"I didn’t enjoy it, I didn’t."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,11,Is that right?” “No.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,31,"You stitched me up and we had a
moment."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,19,"“Are you on birth control?” She nods, her body still relaxed from her orgasm."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,14,My muscles tightened.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,37,Lillie will be thrilled to see her puppy before school.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,3,"You need to let him go, Claire.” My eyes hold hers."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,7,“Portia.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,3,"I thought for sure that she’d have wanted a famous brand instead, but I suppose this’ll help you gain traction."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,11,"My mouth opens, taking a breath, and his warm tongue slips inside."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,24,Her soft lips parted but no other indicator of our interaction was given.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,5,"He was full to the brim, overflowing, and I was empty."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,71,I love you.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,37,I click out of the emails.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,44,"“I’m only going to tell you this one more time, Trace."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,12,She was scared of his answer.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,33,"“Thanks, Gem,” I said, giving her a genuine smile as she stepped to the side of the main cabin door to let me by."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,14,I’d had the pleasure of pleasuring many women in my life.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,1,Dante 32.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,36,"Now, as I arrive at the warehouse with Becka and Sara in tow, both of whom are completely charmed by Jensen, I see Christos taking up the room, and my heart jolts and my pulse starts a racket."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,3,I want you as stable as possible.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,8,"“Honey, I know you have many talents, but I’m seeing a dilemma with trying to drive from there.” “What are you talking about?” I asked, fighting the gravity of my heavy eyelids."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,17,"She tilts her head, ""OHHHHH."""
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,4,“Those are two very different options.” “I know.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,7,"They definitely aligned tonight.” Sam puffed a ribbon of smoke directly in her direction, making her cough."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,33,So wrong.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,11,Pink with flowers.” He huffs out a breath at this extra detail.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,16,We have nothing in common .
Alexa_Riley,Devotion,11,I have to.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,14,the latter.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,22,"“I’m a romantic, okay?"
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,44,"He raises the bottle to his lips, drinks from it."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,6,So it was a good thing that she was single.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,36,What the fuck was the world?
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,47,"I’m… I’m just so jealous , and I hate myself for it.” My eyes widen, and she pulls away, her cheeks flushed."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,32,It is a little weird.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,21,"I closed my eyes, willing time to rewind, wanting to see how in an alternate universe, I had forced her to get out of my side of the cab."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,13,“Do you need any aspirin?
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,5,“You can get the steak going.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,"At six, pink-wearing girls start pouring out of the building."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,8,Stay.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,11,"""Oh, Miss Hanniford!"
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,12,"At his ridiculous wants, I scoffed."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,32,She takes a step forward until her toes bump mine.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,24,“I can’t get enough of you.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,22,"“Not gonna lie, I wish you were smaller,” I blurted out before I could take it back."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,3,I always wondered why.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,9,"“Michael—” “I love hearing my name on your lips.” His mouth lowered and took hers, kissing her deep and long and slow."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,9,I’ll take Simon’s obsession any day compared to a man who doesn’t give a shit.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,"Her scream ripped through the air as she shuddered and arched against him, and he held her as he prolonged her orgasm, keeping her body against his."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,15,“I would never make such a mistake.” His mouth stamped over hers.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,26,Christian turned his head at the exact moment my attention landed on him.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,"Wearing Gage's tux jacket over my dress, I went through the lobby and into the elevator with him."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,2,"“No, Sadie."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,7,"“Oh, I’m just fine,” I said, a bit too dramatic."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,15,Your skin is beautiful.” Beautiful?
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,10,Your aunt—” “Angela invited you.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,25,"“Where were you?” Despite her casual tone, visible tension lined her shoulders."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,4,"Stonewood."""
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,26,My limbs are tingling.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,6,Now Jahleel was acting like the major asshole he was because he thought Trevillo was an Again.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,2,Maddie shook her head.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,34,RULE #32: A GOOD DOM DOESN’T LOSE CONTROL Ronan She is exquisite.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,9,She was stuck.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,8,He turns back to Sasha.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,31,A bead of sweat crawls down my temple.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,15,The idea of Carina suddenly challenging his decisions the moment she landed on his turf fascinated the hell out of him.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,53,"If you have time today, look in the drawer where you found the files."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,1,"“Oh, Merina!” Her mother smiled, but her expression looked a little pained."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,9,"“Sustainably Organized falls under JP’s management, which means he’ll be going.” The steeliness in his voice would scare any other employee, but it washes right over me."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,16,"Let these guys simmer.” A chuckle moved through the room, and several players nodded."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,12,"“Why are you crying?” Maddie sprinted for the door, not ready to answer that question."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,21,"“Why did you wait so long to leave?” “It took me years of working to save up
enough money."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,14,They must be going out for lunch.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,15,"14 ALY H ad anyone told me even a week ago that I’d have a date with Drew Maddox but desperately not want to go, I’d have probably laughed in their face and continued my giddy Empires fangirling."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,8,"“So, when you sleep with women—” “I don’t stay over."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,16,"But I can’t miss someone who I never knew, who was never around.” “I suppose.” I let a beat of silence extend between us."
Sara_Cate,Praise,12,“No.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,32,“Thanks for letting me go all Fight Club on someone and for stopping by McDonald’s on the way home.” He chuckled.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,29,"""Damn you, Sir, "" I snarl."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,14,"Once she was wrapping in Russ’s arms, all of her worries fell away, and she felt bound to him by love."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,13,"He caressed his hand down her thigh, sending little tingles spiraling through her."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,21,"He lets go of me so quickly, that I stumble."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,16,"Even Mick in accounting had dressed up, and he was acting like he was having a good time."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,12,xxx.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,29,"Not only am I unable to see, but my remaining senses have been fooled by him as well."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,5,She must be in the car or something because it went to voice mail again.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,19,“Been a while.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,28,She tosses her head.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,1,“I .
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,30,"“So, w-where will he be?” “Don’t know,” she answered with a shrug."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,3,"â€œTrust me, I was not staring at your breasts,â€ he said, his voice frigid enough to transform the lingering drops of moisture on my skin into icicles."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,73,"He’s right, of course."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,51,"She grabs my swollen shaft at the base, swipes up to the tip, and I huff."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,1,"Wrestling with the anger that started to build inside him, he took a calming breath and said, “Did I not tell you to get dressed?” Her voice was gravelly when she asked, “So I’m just a ‘great sex’ that you send off with a ‘thanks’?” Closing his eyes, he pinched the bridge of his nose."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,19,“Why don’t you start on dinner?” Max suggested.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,5,Good times.

Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,3,"Cock Worldwide?” “Wait, what?” Cock Worldwide is our joke whenever we pass one of the gigantic Locke Worldwide cranes that dominate the construction site of every giant project."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,3,"""Get in,"" Zack said through the open window
of his black Ferrari."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,27,"He does the same with the bread, passing over the rosemary focaccia in favor of cracked wheat—which even I’ll admit makes sense—but when he pops open a bag of Lays and crumbles the plain potato chips over the layer of peanut butter on the bread, my eyes go wide."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,8,Or everything.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,4,"Chin up, girl, don't let him sense your fear."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,5,"She wanted to be near him, but not so close that the longing that she felt overwhelmed her."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,20,"We’ll take this back table.” “Oh, what a shame,” Ellie says, scanning the tables."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,11,"“We’ve
already talked about this and you said you supported my decision."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,17,"“God,” I moan, my back arching as I fall all the way to my back now, showing him I want more."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,10,Like somewhat pleased…that I’m not the only one.

Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,11,"Where Lauren was sleek and long, Becca was short and curvy."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,26,I never thought I’d someday end up sharing his bed.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,22,"My system shut down, my throat dried up, and my heart… It skipped a beat…no, two, three beats before it started hammering in my chest violently, desperate to burst out and flap helplessly on the floor, like a fish out of water."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,12,"I hadn’t meant for it to get this…intense, this complicated."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,13,The numbers on my clock flipped from 12:02 a.m. to 12:03 a.m. My stomach emitted an angry growl at the same time.
Sara_Cate,Praise,20,He doesn’t do that unless it’s a…Dom/sub day.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,7,"Because I’d like to check into the hotel before dinner.” Before he can answer, my cell phone rings."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,28,"One of us has to be the expert on children, and I just felt like this was more your realm than mine,” I explained."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,9,You sleep in separate rooms.” I wonder if he’s fucked her in that bed.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,24,"“That good, huh?” “I might have liked a sport with less contact better.” I laughed then."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,18,"""Oh?"""
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,23,Tag’s suited brother stood from his desk to greet her.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,11,"“A whiskey, double, neat,” he says, looking up at me."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,23,“I’m hungry.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,3,"You’re kind, smart, and think fast on your feet.” He shrugged."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,10,I put my hand on her arm to stop her before she says anything that will do damage.

date men who respect women.” “You don’t think I respect women?” I level a glare."

Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,32,Absolutely not.
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,5,My favorite kind of working environment.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,50,"“Yeah,” she says, her voice breathy."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,4,What is it you’re not telling me?” “It’s the house.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,4,No one will expect you to wear the same thing twice.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,40,She threw down two five-dollar bills and demanded to know what Smuckers wanted to tell her.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,12,“Have I mentioned that I love you?” he asks sleepily.
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,5,She flinched.

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,43,My shaft jerks; a pressure coils in my balls.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,6,My nostrils had already been seduced by the delicious aromas of freshly baked breads and soups.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,12,“Exactly.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,14,"Chapter Ten One week later, Caterina took in the massive crowds scattered over the grounds and grinned with satisfaction."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,"When did you get back?” A man’s cheerful voice boomed behind Brontë, making her jump."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,15,We laughed and wondered if maybe they’d known each other after all.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,62,"Chapter Sixty-Two Valentina My bedroom door opens, and hope rushes through me, only for it to vanish the second I see Sierra and Raven."

LT_Swan,The Takeover,8,. .
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,23,Almost…though it sure seems like all of my dreams have come true.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,Really.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,33,I just didn’t expect myself to have so much clarity when it finally came round to it.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,58,Ares lets go of my hand and grabs his phone.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,4,"None of the art was big enough to need two people, but it would be good to see how this delivery arrangement worked."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,17,"In the kitchen, I grabbed another beer from the fridge and popped the cap off before handing it to her."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,23,Damn it.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,15,I was still processing it myself – specifically everything Emmett said.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,18,"And she puts up with my cranky ass, accepts me exactly as I am.” Breathless from his tirade, Simon sucked in a trembling, uneven gulp of air."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,6,"“Look, Michael."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,38,I have to talk to the boys.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,48,It’s all the pictures of you in lingerie that I don’t even have to sneakily take.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,7,"“This is our last offer,” Brett says."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,35,"“I bet you’d be amazing at it.” “My mother, of all people, suggested I do it, and now, I think it sounds like the right choice.” “Is that what you want then?” “It was the only thing that really made me happy in grad school."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,21,“I did already.” “What?” I gasped.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,43,His eyebrows rise as the water reaches my waist.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,8,Cam is quiet until I put the loaf into the oven and set the timer.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,27,"When we finally pulled up at the apartment complex by the refinery, someone opened the door for us and announced that Da and Cillian were in Da’s room upstairs."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,25,“How could I hate you when you’re the only person I can see myself spending three years with?
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,14,My whole body is buzzing.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,18,"“When did you get to be such a pessimist ?” “Since birth,” I point out."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,25,"“I mean, I’m not leaving you again ."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,2,Promises kept.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,27,"And Simon deserved that happiness, that kind of devotion from a woman."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,28,A woman can change her mind and all of a sudden you’re dragged all over social media.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,14,"“Time for a quick and efficient K.O., Sam."
Katy_Evans,Boss,24,You have shattered every expectation I ever had of love.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,14,He’s just a random guy.” I hit my keyboard with force.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,33,Congratulations.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,5,"“Of course, it’s impossible to win when someone deliberately stacks the deck against you.” “Who would do such an outrageous thing?” “Someone who was up at dawn with Cade and knew he wasn’t in the house when the bet was made,” she said dryly."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,31,Typical.” She begins to panic.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,6,"“We do need some time after all that’s happened, but it would be nice to plan it.” “I’ll be more than happy to do my part to help,” Max replied, his voice intense and sensual, as though he couldn’t wait to get her naked."

Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,20,But mostly . . .
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,12,“Please tell me some details—like what put that wistful twinkle in your eye.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,4,"He blows out smoke, before placing it between my lips."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,53,My eyes are on his as I grab the necklace around his neck.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,2,"His gaze burned into her from across the room, even when hiding behind the barriers of people."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,31,"“Mmm…” “Let me fuck you.” “Mmm,” was her response."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,3,"“Newsflash, losers: Max Hilton picks up girls because he looks like Max Hilton."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,9,"“Yes, yes, yes,” Anna said, reaching down to grip his hair."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,27,"The path between those points had been riddled with disagreements, barbs, and a strange mix of mutual respect and suspicion."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,23,“You’re welcome.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,14,"He looked away, color rising on his sharp cheekbones."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,10,"Snatch her into alcoves in the house or steal her away to the butterfly garden, whispering sweet nothings into her ear."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,21,"Businessmen were all the same, forever chasing the next big deal with no regard for their health until it was too late."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,9,"""I've seen humans naked and vulnerable."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,24,"It hurts to know she deceived me, but I also know in my heart that she did it with the best intentions."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,28,"“I should never have let him in,” she said, her voice flat."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,27,I hope.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,10,"“Jameson,” I breathe against him."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,15,I’m saying get some kind of closure so you can let it go.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,1,“No.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,47,"""Have you spoken to her yet?"""
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,7,The institution was a Chicago treasure.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,7,Her eyes met Sam’s and her heart skittered.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,46,"Then, he drops to his knees in front of me, pressing his lips to my stomach, and I run my fingers through his hair."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,37,"I want somebody believable, but too annoying to tempt me—no emotional entanglements, thank you very much."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,14,"""I'm not smug."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,26,I kiss his hair as he comes.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,9,Let the day begin!
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,Did he say anything about it?
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,7,Sexy .
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,31,"When the room was cleared, leaving them as the only occupants, he looked at Trevillo and shot straight, “What’re you doing here, man?” “Excuse me?” Zane leaned forward in his seat, dropping his elbows on his thighs."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,33,"“Exhausted?” “Yes,” he groaned as I rubbed the back of his neck."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,25,I’m so weak I can barely finish a sentence.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,10,He really could get used to her being a part of his life on a permanent basis.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,14,Christ.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,22,He’s always buttoned up in his suits.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,10,"I wouldn’t ask except that … well, something is bothering you, isn’t it?” “I shouldn’t have e-mailed your business account,” I admitted."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,15,"Seconds tick past, turning into minutes."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,19,But she obeyed the request because it would probably get him out of her room more quickly.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,15,"Come in.” We went into his office, a room in all pale blues and whites that reminded me of the ocean."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,7,“This’ll be my third meeting and still nothing.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,48,"""Even I have my shortcomings, it seems,"" he retorts."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,35,"What do you say?” She gasped when she heard her name, and her gaze whipped to me."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,12,"""If I were egotistical, I’d say that you would enjoy that, but it’s not your physical surrender that I want."""
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,13,She elbowed Isa.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,32,"“Just rack the balls while I go play some songs,” I ordered and walked over toward the jukebox, sliding a few dollars out of my back pocket."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,6,Did they already start?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,25,"I thought you were a spitfire, then along came a spider and frightened little Miss Muffet away."""
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,10,"“Not
too bad."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,40,"No, Saint doesn’t understand the meaning of the word love."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,11,“I saw that.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,18,"I heard you had a pretty awesome babysitter and thought I would drop by to hang out, too."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,9,A hell of a lot more.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,"“Wait,” Gretchen said, jumping to her feet."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,12,I loved making a man squirm underneath my ministrations.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,24,I feel more comfortable with these two women that I don’t know all that well than I did with my stepmom and sisters.
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,5,"What if she had already gotten him out of her system, or worse—what if her feelings for him had soured the moment those two pink strips materialized and changed the course of her life forever ?"
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,8,"(He usually hadn’t, thankfully.)"
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,I've got too many of my own pieces to pick up.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,16,The muscles under his skin were tight and I snapped open some bath cream.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,24,"The two men hugged, clapping one another on the back."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,13,"Before I knew it, it was getting late and I needed to take a second to relax, so I drew a bath.” “Oh, I’m sure he has a really nice bathtub.” “Really nice."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,32,"Dramatic emerald cliffs towered thousands of feet above the Pacific, their steep ridges and narrow valleys curling around pristine beaches at their feet in a protective embrace."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,28,"That was the deal I made with him if he wanted me to continue
developing systems and software for him."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,14,This isn’t working.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,28,So you might wanna thank me when you see me.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,21,"He’d get his satisfaction, but she came first."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,7,"“I thought they were meant to be together forever.” Clearly, they weren’t."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,41,"We’re already running late.” “I’m
the boss."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,31,"â€œItâ€™s quite easy to implant false memories, especially in the mind of a confused, traumatized child."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,17,Thinking about it gave me fucking nightmares.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,30,She told me I could have just texted her instead of walking over.” Lexi snickered.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,21,She gets a text.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,Including love.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,10,"In a few days, you saw things I’d never even realized."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,3,Not one bit.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,27,You’re right.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,23,"I was afraid he'd gotten a leg blown off or something—and he was all in one piece, thank God."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,53,Maybe I had given up hope somewhere inside.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,"""But we've got to dispose of the evidence."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,4,"Entering his home,
the windows were open as Cynthia, the housekeeper, had aired the house for him
prior to him coming."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,23,I searched the extravagant blooms until I found a tiny card with my name written on the front.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,3,"“Ah, well."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,3,"“If you don’t have anything work related to talk to me about, I’ll get going.” I clench my jaw as I stare at her; the air crackles between us."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,26,"He takes the tray with the remaining drink glasses from her, and thrusts it at Weston, who grunts, ""Don’t make too much noise, will ya?"""
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,43,“Future’s a lot brighter now that you’re here.” I don’t know if I’m sobering up or if his enthusiasm is killing the mood.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,15,Three.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,23,She turned her face away as if she’d been slapped.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,7,"“Hmm, secrets and revelations."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,13,"A hot flush crept over her cheeks—in the photo, she was clinging to Logan, the two of them wrapped around each other, the Statue looming in the distance."
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,4,Either he goes or I go .” Eloise taps her drumstick again.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,37,"I stared at Camo, and he stared back, smugness oozing from his ugly mug."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,41,"And even though that was half correct, I was sick of it."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,20,You’re not in any of your pictures.” “I …” I looked around.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,28,Yeah!
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,2,How do you deal with the attention she gets if this annoys you?” Ares sighs and runs a hand through his hair.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,29,"He was probably awake, but I forced myself to stay put in case he wasnâ€™t."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,15,She’s creative.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,22,I stared at where his Patek Philippe glinted against his bronzed skin.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,7,She really felt like a princess about to enter her first ball.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,16,"“As much hell as Garrett has given you over the years, he has always looked out for you."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,9,"Liquid, white gel coated my fingers, and I wondered when was the last time I masturbated."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,9,The secret was simple.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,30,It’s cute.” He takes another pull of the tawny near beer.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,11,He wasn't even bothering to hide it.
Sara_Cate,Praise,34,It’s taken in the dim club.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,28,"The woman is dead, and if the rumors I’ve heard from my cousins are true, her death was at her own hand."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,1,"“And if you’re not near the door, you can just speak your command aloud and Alexa will execute it.” “Who’s Alexa?” I asked, worried someone was about to burst out from under the bed."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,27,"“Ruby.” It’s a sacred whisper as I watch her pull me into her mouth, grasping the base with her hand and meeting it as she licks around the shaft like an ice cream cone."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire's Toy,15,"I take out the anal beads next, shivering each time one pops free and sends another riot through my nervous system."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,It wouldn't be good for me or Carrington if I hopped from place to place.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,2,"I shower and dress, then kiss Mr. Bingley good-bye and head to work."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,2,"Her continued insistence he was secretly in love with Alexa usually amused him, but now he faced something more vital."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,21,"Taking measured steps to the front door, I glanced through the window."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,9,“The truth?
LT_Swan,The Takeover,3,"“There are a lot of hot opportunities at these kinds of conferences, Claire.” “Are you kidding me?” I stare at her deadpan."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,3,"She would be as disoriented in the face of love as he would be, because neither of them had a clue what it was."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,10,I spread my legs in a dare and raise my eyebrows at him.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,1,Holy Christ!
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,and it made her laugh.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,16,"“Let me have a look, maybe I can…” “No!” I cried out."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,13,"If I’d shown the least bit of tenderness when we’d run into each other on the street, he would’ve gone on with his life without giving me a second thought, as he’d been doing for the past two years."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,23,"I was about to ask what she looked so giddy for but then she threw her arms around me, going on her tiptoes to hiss next to my ear."
Sara_Cate,Praise,11,"I really, really wanted it.” Then I spy his name tag and add a flirty, “Travis,” in for good measure."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,27,"She grins, tossing it to the side."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,36,Are you okay?” “I’m better than okay.” My mood is still tense as I stare out the window.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,35,I pressed a soft kiss to her shoulder and wrapped a possessive arm around her waist.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,32,"“Careful,” I murmur."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,2,She then taps the faces of happy newlyweds.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,45,"""And you say you love me?"""
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,9,And Max gets to shake up your world and make it snow whenever he pleases.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,4,"A date, perhaps?"
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,25,I had been so wrong in so many ways.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,20,"Let’s call it a night.” I lean in, whispering, but I’m sure it’s way too loud after all my drinks, so Captain America hears everything."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,17,“I take it you weren’t impressed with the whisking-you-away-to-Oahu-by-private-plane bit?
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,7,He was gloriously naked above her and she greedily rubbed her hands along the muscled length of his back and arms.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,36,No wonder I was struggling so hard with them.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,36,"His body movements were jerky, angry, and he was sweating, his hair sticking to his forehead in dark clumps."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,3,She crammed the knowledge to a secret place inside.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,The bathroom door rattled.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,7,"“You have some serious explaining to do.” “I know, and we’ll talk about it later."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,23,"The same prelude is played again, but this time, it’s played beautifully."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,22,"“I didn’t notice till now but you’re right,” Lia smiled, giving the back of my hand a little kiss before letting it rest in her lap."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,31,"“There’s a new romantic comedy coming out next week,” Sloane said."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,3,Small mercies.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,14,"“You were just nervous, lass."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,11,.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,4,“I’ve got a mother and sisters if I need help.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,7,"“If that’s what it takes, I’ll do it."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,24,I had a suspicion but I didn’t want to get it wrong.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,29,Let me guess.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,36,Tell me how I knocked you off your feet from the first moment I opened my mouth and you heard my incredibly sexy voice.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,2,No response.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,15,No one’s ordering Happy Meals.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,13,"“ No .” She curled her hands on his shoulders, her breath hitching in her throat."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,12,"How could she possibly have any regrets, when she felt so full?"
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,7,"“Was that French?” Martin’s voice is still loud, and he turns from me to the screen."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,12,She hadn’t initiated contact with him once since they’d reunited.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,8,She knew the walk back to his house was a long one but there was a trail and it would be good for her.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,23,"They’d both lost their husbands in one week, so they were my priority."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,42,"I balance the phone, with Isla peering out at me from the screen, on the kitchen table, ""Kirsten called me a car—okay a limo."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,32,But you two could be really good for each other.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,29,"""It’s fine,"" I swallow."
Sara_Cate,Praise,30,I’m not worth this much money.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,37,"The conviction that she wanted me for my money, for my family, for my connections, for my friends—it hasn’t come."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,10,It was a defense mechanism.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,5,She stopped at the back of the room where a few stairs led down to a separate space that looked as if it could have been a playroom at one time.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,6,"“Yeah.” “ That’s what you were doing instead of COO for Crane Hotels.” She looked up at him, seeing him differently than she had a moment ago."
Alexa_Riley,Devotion,14,“Noah!” she shouts as I kick off my boxer briefs and my hard cock points right at her pussy.

Tia_Louise,Trouble,8,"He’s big, and I’m full."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,11,“Why?
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,17,"With my hand on the back of her head, I force myself farther down her throat until I see her flinch with the need to gag, so I ease myself back."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,16,"But on some level, it’s good for her to see the penalties of dating men like Tevin."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,16,"I want to run the winery with you, and be your lover, and your friend."

Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,19,Like…that’s a lot of pressure.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,16,It was as if he wasn’t at all influenced by the fact that the woman was shamelessly flirting with him.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,35,Except for getting Joselyn to take a chance on me.
Emma_Bray,Her Billionaire Stalker,8,I kiss it reverently and stroke its slick folds with my tongue.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,5,"“Look, I don’t think you should be alone right now.” “Living with you will help me?” “I’m hoping it will give you a chance to get over the pain of losing your friend.” He took a seat on the bed, taking her hands."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,5,"“ That ,” I said, setting my glass on the table and folding my wrist down to show off my diamond, “is my engagement ring.” A chorus of gasps, shouts, and a couple Grazie Dio ’s went up."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,25,"“She was,” I interject with a bit more force."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,27,No.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,42,"Please let me know if there are any updates.” “I will.” I hung up and went through the motions of finishing breakfast, but I was too distracted to taste anything."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,There were rumors of casual drug-dealing.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,7,I immediately discarded the inane thought that it was his voice.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,38,"“Because you’re beautiful, Jackson Boudreaux."

Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,16,"The last thing I wanted to do was
run into Kinsley today, but it couldn’t be helped since she was sitting right
outside his office."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,11,"We pass the wave runner still getting too close to the shallows, and I see it’s a pre-teen boy."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,9,She steps forward to hold her wide umbrella over me.

Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,20,"Or the kind of man who rejoices in someone else’s downfall?” “No,” I answered honestly."

Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,19,"“Yeah, because I wanted a fresh start, I wanted a life where no one knew who my parents were or what they’d done.” She pushed her hair out of her face, more than likely blinking rapidly in an attempt to hold back tears."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,12,"Even worse, he’d made her infatuated with him AGAIN."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,3,"“Can I help you?” “Yes, you can."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,16,Huh.

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,18,"Something cold nudges my face, a wet tongue licks my mouth, ""Seriously, Buttercup, we need to talk about your morning breath."""
LT_Swan,The Takeover,23,“Too bad.” Our lips crash together as he holds my face in his hands.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,19,“What are you up to?” I sighed and dropped the attitude.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,7,And I am not.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,54,"It whirs over us, followed by a slight thump as vibrations roll down the walls."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,5,"“I’ll see you in a few?” “Sounds good.” I opened the driver’s side door for her, and she tossed her purse onto the passenger seat."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,2,"Without her heels on, she looks so fucking tiny."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,28,"Keep calm.” Ruddy, Natalio’s main man, snorted and pushed his big muscled body past them and into the house."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,38,"With the added pressure of the plug, I’m not just soaring toward my climax, I’m careening toward it, head-on like a violent collision."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,26,"New York, Christian’s weird aversion to art, the watch, his confession about wanting me."

Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,16,"Huxley: I don’t tend to agree with JP very often, but I would have to say he’s probably right on this one."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,24,"Her chest rose and fell with every breath, and she stared at me with nothing but trust in those big, brown eyes."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,15,And distant.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,55,"I suppose Faye is a really hot teacher, so I can hardly blame them for their little crushes."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,12,"Luckily—and I use that term very fucking loosely—Captain Save-a-Bro, AKA Sailor, promised she wouldn’t snitch on my ass in her weekly report to Da, which made me feel like a teacher’s pet, sans the fun part, where I got rewarded with a blowie (or was that only in porn?)."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,15,But to whom do I return it?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,52,"""You think it's about the money?"""
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,34,Michael used me to get the show.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,34,"“You won’t be able to speak about the incident in the ladies’ room or your personal relationship with Michael, or publicly disparage Maddox Publishing in any way."

Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,14,"“Tev, calm down."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,62,In that scrap of fabric that barely covered her luscious flesh?
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,30,"So I take him so far into the back of my throat that I gag, coughing as I come up, and he grunts in response."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,6,Belle hadn’t returned home last night.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,8,"He was so stunned by her refusal, he almost allowed her to walk out the door."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,23,"""You hate chocolate,"" I mutter."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,8,"“Everyone,” Reese announced."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,10,"Oh, hell."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,13,I’m relatively certain you can look over everyone’s head.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,14,But my first session in his training clinic is also listed as Not Approved for Coverage .
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,27,Who wear shirts displaying their anger toward you.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,8,"Then they walked upstairs hand-in-hand, winding around hallways until Reese came to a stop in front of a door."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,55,I huff.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,11,I never felt right when I started the day without it.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,23,"Simon, I didn’t expect this.” She pulled the huge, sparkling diamond ring, housed in a platinum setting, from its velvet home, her fingers trembling."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,24,Focus.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,6,"“Five dollars says I’m painted as one of your ninnies by night’s end,” she said."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,68,Everything we’ve been through in recent weeks has become a silver lining that I’ll always be grateful for.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,14,"I can’t quite put my finger on it, but something about her reminds me of my father."

Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,16,"Annie scratched Snoopy behind the ears, locked her door
and placed the keys in her Fendi bag."

Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,She remembered the look he gave her.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,36,"Either way, I knew I wouldn’t fall apart in front of him."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,34,"Like, he gives me foot rubs every night."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,6,"“It wouldn’t be Fletcher International if we did that.” “You know, you don’t have to do this launch."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"I let my shoulders slump, feeling drained in the aftermath of my personal catastrophe."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,12,"I’ll get it cleaned and wear it every day, remembering what it felt like to fuck you in it."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,33,Do they know about the pregnancy clause?” “No.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,12,That clinic that you’ve seen?
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,6,And she also wanted to lift that jacket up to get a better look.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,10,“There we go.” She clasped her hands in her lap and waited.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,13,“Why didn’t you choose this as the master suite?
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,16,I’m going mad.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,19,The heat between us is palpable.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,18,This whole fake fiancé routine is insane.

Rose_Shain,Reverie,10,Brey rubbed her forehead.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,62,"""Karma!"""
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,36,It was simple and elegant and had no personal touch.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,3,"I hadnâ€™t wanted to inconvenience them and thought I could call an Uber and be back at Thayerâ€™s campus in half an hour, but the skies opened up right after the couple left and, well, here I was."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,35,"“What’s going on?” “I just dominated that blow job.” “You did, honey,” I agreed on a grin."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,21,“God.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,22,I have no idea what she’s told him about the situation or what I should say about it.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,2,"He hated men who beat their wives, children, or set out to hurt those weaker."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,13,"Then he strolled up to the microphone and started to speak, and that smooth, rich-like-molasses voice proved that it was."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,12,Nothing else existed around me in that moment.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,4,"Flustered, I stammer, “I ."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,10,Caviar tastes awful with human hearts.” Vivian’s laugh evoked a strange sensation in my chest.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,66,The way he looks at me will never get old.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,28,“You’re not dying!” She waved a hand impatiently as if to swat away a fly.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,24,That was how I had reacted with every other woman post-Vanessa.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,18,"“I still have some discomfort when I move in particular ways, but no more fives.” Spencer’s voice is muffled from being in the cushion."

Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,10,"Lucy put
the phone back to her ear."

Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,5,Your name is a backwards president .
LJ_Shen,The Villain,2,I’m positive.” My older sister was the memorable one.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,7,"“Reese!” she finally panted, her words breathless."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,14,"“Oh my God, fingers crossed but even if you don’t get it, I’m so fucking proud of you and this calls for all the champagne."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,39,“Being in that town isn’t good for your health.” She sighed.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,4,I told him that sounded like a stupid idea.” “And . . .

Katy_Evans,Tycoon,24,"“So with House of Sass software, even for men, the task of choosing their outfit is removed.” He leans back in his chair, interested."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,37,Then Joshâ€”my ticket into your house every Thanksgivingâ€”announced he was volunteering in Central America.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,9,"When the press gets ahold of the news, you’re going to need it.” She was too pure for this world, too foreign to understand that an empire like this one would crumble and rip you apart if you weren’t careful."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,5,"“D o not let this spin out of control,” Troy warned the following day while we were sitting in my office in Badlands, enjoying a hot toddy—heavy on the whiskey—and the blissful sound of my workers running around in the hallway, fulfilling my orders."
Sara_Cate,Praise,30,"Right as I inhale, something clamps down hard on my right nipple, and I let out a shriek, twisting and contorting, trying to move away from the pain, but it won’t let up."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,3,Then I agonized over that too.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,27,"You just chose to deal with it in a really shitty way.” I
immediately swerved and pulled over on the side of the highway, clenching the
steering wheel so tight that my knuckles were turning white."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,25,"“You’ve got a pair of balls on you, Miss Francé.” I daggered his steely grays with my cognac browns."

Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,8,"“Can I take you to dinner, please?” Drew asked her."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,12,"“Fine, I will return home."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,26,I glower at her.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,33,"“Smuckers has something to tell you, Bernadette,” I say."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,23,His eyes widened in alarm.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,33,"You wanted to focus on your career, and you didn’t want any distractions that could possibly pull you away from that."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,41,The things that aren’t said.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,17,You know what I mean.” “I want us to make a go of it.” He shrugs.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,16,These two were anything but serious.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,1,"They all had a need to live on the open road, and the adventure of being part of a club, which meant fighting much bigger things."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,47,"""The first touch you recall?"""
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,15,"I do need a break, but not the kind you’re thinking of."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,"""Nick,"" I managed, ""we'll sit down and talk as long as you want if you'll just put the gun aw — "" I broke off with a grunt of pain as I felt a blunt white explosion behind my ear, and heard a tinny high-pitched sound."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,22,"“So, are you going to tell us Hunter’s charges?” Emmabelle poked my ribs."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,11,“This one.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,4,“Doesn’t give you an excuse to act like an asshole.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,30,“You gonna do the right thing for us?
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,35,"So after leaving the restaurant that morning, I went back to the house and threw a few things in a bag."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,33,"“Okay,” I finally said, my voice barely above a whisper."
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,15,“Are you imagining my sister naked?” he growls .
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,30,That I’m not like your company – I’m too small and too new and he could crush me because he’s rich and connected and all that jazz.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,11,“I like things to taste strong.” The hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention: the way he said that was decidedly sexual.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,20,"“This is where I teach you about listening to me.” “Listening to what?” He drags his finger over my body again, up to my breasts, where he draws tight circles, and then back to my stomach."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,14,"Will you put together complete packets with the current map, top-level-page printouts, and our overview goals?"
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,12,Too fucking bad.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,55,"""You come first."""
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,23,I don’t.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,18,"Me and Zoey, in a car for all those days and hours, alone."

Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,3,"This part of Maryland was pretty safe, but you never knew."

Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,33,I rise.
Sara_Cate,Praise,32,"I suck eagerly at her clit, and she screams, her knuckles turning white as she grips the couch."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,21,"“Get to the point,” he hissed."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,29,"He closed the door (the new one, which didn’t take a fucking century to close), because now, we met all the time to talk about everything, without Cillian as a buffer."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,"I stared into Carrington's pooling eyes, flinching at her incredulous scream as the nurse injected the vaccines into her plump little thighs."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,9,Good question.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,39,“Let me take you home.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,1,"It’s just, you know, you’ve been gone for so long…” “I had maternity leave!” I shove my chair back, leaping to my feet."
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,7,Would love to see if there’s any flesh to squeeze.

Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,A sausage-sized forefinger sported a gold nugget ring shaped like Texas.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,26,"“No, you didn’t."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,3,"“What’s so funny?” “Nothing at all.” It sure sounded like he was amused by something, but what it was, she didn’t know."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,23,Do you have any idea how pissed my sponsors will be if I don’t make it to the Olympics?
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,29,They did have that in common.
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,26,"My pussy roars to life and demands a ride on the pony, but public fornication hasn’t ever actually done anything good for me ."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,2,He sighed as he grabbed a glass of wine from a passing waiter.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,5,Does she always get wet on these calls?
Katy_Evans,Boss,5,"He said I shouldn’t look at you as an enemy and that we should—work together, to make this transition go smoothly."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,20,"And two: By request, I was preparing one of his favorite dishes."

GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,9,I clamp my lips together and wait for the smirk I’m sure is coming.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,38,Think of one thing you can hold over Sara’s head.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,18,Da made it a point to change them every season so I wouldn’t learn to rely on a woman.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,12,Her breasts jiggle and her nipples perking up to salute me… So does my dick.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,41,"I want to take care of you more than anything, baby girl."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,37,"A uniformed valet opens the door and helps me out, appreciatively eyeing the expanse of bare thigh revealed by the slit in my skirt."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,32,"“The quarterback of the Cobras instructed his linemen to crush Hardy’s hand in the first game of the season, putting Hardy at a huge disadvantage for the year.” A clip of Wes yelling “Crush his hand” to his linemen was replayed."

happening with my panties?"
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,5,My sickness quickly turns to anger.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,27,You want children.” I shook my head.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,17,"""Exactly."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,27,"“Whoops, sorry,” the clumsy woman apologized, putting a flirty hand to my arm and smiling."

Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,24,"The guy who almost got Hayes kicked out of fancy high school prep school by claiming Hayes was copying him , then saying Hayes had mental health issues and he needed to be institutionalized, like mental health issues are something to be ashamed of, and then sliding the tabloids lies about Hayes doing drugs to cope with his weird sexual fetishes all through college, and I am not saying any more."

Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,24,I grab his arm.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,12,“So…what’s the deal between your dad and Reid’s dad?
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,2,Far too bright.

LT_Swan,The Casanova,32,"“Training?” “We can start tonight, if you like?” He throws a camisole over his arm."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,19,Let alone a professional golfer.

Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,7,Soda?

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,12,"He waggles his eyebrows, ""A hot honey, no doubt."
Katy_Evans,Boss,23,"“Cheers!” We clink glasses, and as Kit meets my gaze above the rims of our glasses, I can’t help but be excited for what’s in store."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,59,"""What...what happened next?"""
LJ_Shen,The Monster,10,"Let me guess, the flowers are not fresh enough or someone failed to compliment her on her dress—which, by the way, makes her look like drywall.” I stomped on his foot, making him wince and clutch his toes."

Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,22,"You okay?” “Yeah, I’ve just been waiting to put my hands all over you since I woke up this morning, and I don’t think I can last any longer.” My lashes fluttered and I let out the breathiest “ oh ” to ever come out of my mouth."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,11,"""Who was she?"""
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,21,My daughter didn’t make it.” He eyes me for a long moment.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,23,"But since that clearly wasn’t going to happen, I told myself I’d go to frat parties, and mixers, and I’d have that perfect all-American teen life in college.” “Did you?” I frowned."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,16,"But she merely stared at me, wide-eyed and dumbfounded."

Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,44,I can’t handle it when he looks at me that way.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,1,The worry blossomed into a full-fledged panic attack.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,31,The first couple of steps were a little shaky as she felt for the edges of the blades for the first time in years.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,16,But it’s also his prison.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,21,“You can’t do that!” “What can’t I do?” She narrows her eyes.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,43,"You were only getting in their way."""
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,17,And that we don’t ever use that word.” That made for a pretty good quote.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,29,I wanted her on that fucking floor and this call was ruining it.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,4,There’s something else he told me.” “Oh.” He set the spoon down and turned with a touch of panic.

Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,21,My girl is so eager.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,36,"“Why would you drag me into this?” Marc’s and Vanessa’s lawyers were looking at the document, but it was clear from their faces that they agreed with Jake."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,12,He’d known in his gut she was a sexual firecracker.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,25,"“You don’t get to do that,” I said through gritted teeth."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,22,"We can head to dinner.” “That
sounds good.” We
went up to the Lone Eagle Grill where Carter ordered the filet and I ordered
the roasted chicken."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,9,Why not squeeze me dry?” She shrugged.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,11,"“Hold on, it might not be that bad,” Kelsey says."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,1,"Thank you, baby Jesus."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,21,“Take me home.” “I’m taking you to mine.” “No.

Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,8,“Five years from now you could have a husband and two kids.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,12,"My insurance.” “Your monthly payment will go up if you use your insurance, you know.” She quirked one ginger eyebrow."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,9,“You kind of realize it’s better to stay that way.” “Alone?” he asked softly.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,17,“Have you ever sucked a cock?” “What…!” It’s a good thing I don’t currently have food in my mouth because I would spit it out.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,22,I know about the ruler.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,25,“I went out for drinks.” My casual drawl didn’t match the beat of my pulse.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,24,There are hours before my heart has to be ready to accept that Reid might not want to commit something to me.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,9,"Sometimes my mom and Jason come, but sometimes we come in together."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,11,I wanted to make it better for her.

Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,13,"“I think you’re so special, Sam Shaw,” she said, dropping a kiss on our joined hands."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,7,"“I take it then that what happens in the elevator before work is an exception.” “Actually, I called you in here to touch upon that.” “Oh?” She arched an eyebrow."

Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,16,"“She’s really good at hormonal manipulation.” I glanced down to catch sight of her hand on me, and, embarrassed, she moved to pull it back."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,20,"Which, obviously, I didn’t."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,14,"Hannah is a diva, and some guys are really into that, but you aren’t one of them."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,25,I didn’t deserve the name Blacksille .
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,7,"He’d whip off his shirt and wrap it about me, surrounding me with the scent of sun-dried cotton and salty seas, then heft me into his chiseled arms and carry me to the nearest tavern, where he’d spoon-feed me broth and murmur low in Italian about how he’ll avenge my honor, and keep me safe until such a day as he’s run his dagger through the hearts of every highwayman in Europe."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,19,"Was it because of the baby? """
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,37,"She answered after the second doorbell ring, took one look at my luggage and ringless finger, and ushered me inside without a word."

Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,3,"I had an upcoming dinner with Delamonte in New York, which my manager said was an audition for their brand ambassador position."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,3,"“We need to talk.” Richard noticed she was wearing a bathrobe, which
only served to piss him off."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,28,It helps I’ve had several more glasses of wine.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,5,"In my tiny pantry, she found some Ritz crackers, and counted out four for each of us while I rinsed and sliced an apple."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,2,"“Too many to count, I’m afraid."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,8,"I’m a visual learner, after all.” “I see.” His gaze moved toward her, and then he glanced away as if burned."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,3,"And with that simple action, all the unusual calm of our interaction was gone."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,38,“I’ll be in the dining room when you guys are finished.” We wait another minute or two before we take a breath and exit the bathroom.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,6,I’m sorry for misjudging you.” Her fingers ran over the belt faster.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,4,The music started up again.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,14,"Her legs are around my waist, and I walk the short distance across the living room to my bedroom."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,27,"Do you understand
me?” “Of
course, Jamieson."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,16,"Instead, I hold up this incredibly stiff smile and nod."

JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,10,"“Thank you, James."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,16,"“And always will be.” “Better an asshole in a castle, than a street rat in fancy clothes.” She kept walking, refusing to give him the satisfaction of a reply."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,6,"I followed them as they left, locking the door and pulling down the cream shade with a snap."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,5,There’s a reason natural selection is the way it is.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,12,"“We believe it’s something you should do.” “The club, we started something, and we’re going to
finish it."

Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,7,"""Done,"" William said."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,15,“I went over Eric’s forms twice so they should be fine.” I try again but all she does is nod.

Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,37,Her chest rose and fell rapidly with the fight to keep taking in air.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,Your eyes are distant.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,26,What I’m sayin’ is that you’re highly sensitive about your looks.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,5,"“Please, continue to pleasure me with your commands.” “I’m talking to Huxley and asking him if I can fall under his management because our working relationship is volatile.” “Ooh, you see, I was with you on points one and two, but unfortunately, your line of work falls under my line of work, therefore, that makes you my employee."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,28,Rejection of his touch.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,10,I want to bone my boss.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,19,Don’t call me.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,21,“Twenty grand!” Daisy looks from Heather to me.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,31,I was so wrong.
Katy_Evans,Mogul,13,"We haven’t had dinner, and I’m usually fed and in bed by this hour."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,24,â€œYes.â€ â€œSay it.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,8,“You neglected to mention that.” Simon shot Kara a dark look.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,21,"“How are you getting home?” “Subway,” he says."

LT_Swan,The Stopover,29,I exhale heavily and dial her number.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,8,"You can’t change the rules after we made an agreement!” “Cameron McGregor can do whatever he likes, lass.” He steps backward and makes a move to close the door."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,7,"The biggest one belonged to Da, followed by Cillian’s (second biggest), and Syllie’s (third biggest)."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,22,"“This
is so cute.” I smiled as I looked around."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,I won’t.” She dropped my hands and picked up her water bottle.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,5,He shoved his hands into his pocket.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,55,“Do something.” Christopher’s eyes widen and then he bursts out laughing.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,15,I’d held on to the feelings I’d had as a child and given them adult importance and justification.

something that will likely pin me further in my grave, I grab my purse and
stand."

Alexa_Riley,Devotion,21,It looks like a fortress.
Sara_Cate,Praise,28,"Something about that action, the way his body moves, the promise of sex, has me in knots, and I moan again."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,40,"But please, please , Sara, don’t punish me for telling you this by blaming yourself and spiraling into some dark place."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,21,My breath was coming out in pants.

LJ_Shen,The Monster,7,“You are my business.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,20,"“But if you hurt her again, Enzo Moretti, I will hunt you down and destroy you .” “I’m not going to hurt her,” I promised, my mind already clicking."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,14,What if I’d ruined things between us forever and we could never look each other in the eye again?
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,2,"His
head, and another part of his anatomy, jerked up."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,22,He lies beside me on the bed and runs his fingers through my hair as he looks down at me.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,"""I thought you might be here, but I wasn't sure...."" He spoke in the voice I had craved for so long, deeper now than in his youth."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,"The tub is full of water and topped off with bubbles, while candles provide the only light in the room."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,27,I heard her voice telling me she loved me.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,18,“Tell me how you want me.” He swirled his finger and she almost forgot what they’d been discussing.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,"It didn't always work, but sometimes I achieved a few gratifying spasms, and when I couldn't and began to feel irritated and chafed."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,28,"If you don’t mind, I’ll take you to him while I track down Stellan and secure his business.” “Why is Stephen here?"
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,29,"“A’ight, Sarah, do your thing.” Appeased, Sarah turned back to me."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,14,Which was probably why I made it exactly five days after she started the Clomid before I asked her if it had been ten days yet.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,16,"“I went to the twilight zone yesterday, Jameson.” “How so?” “Let me set the tone of the kind of people I’m dealing with here.” He frowns in question."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,I heard the ring of a cell phone.

Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,14,Twice .
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,11,"His eyes locked on hers and he reached out his hand, asking for her complete surrender."

Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"I knew how to do the things that kept it running smoothly, all the minor and major requirements that kept Nick on an even keel."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,13,"People to call, arrangements to make for Daphne’s car, managers to scold, her boss to check in with . . ."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,12,"Like he’s trying to tell me something else, something deeper, but before I can decipher exactly what it is, he’s heading toward the living room and then out his door."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,39,I’d get married again.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,17,"But with Vicky, I actually am interested."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,10,“Is it a mutual decision to divorce?” “I have no idea.

Katy_Evans,Boss,5,"I chide my body to get a grip, please ."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,19,Whoa!

Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,16,"When only a few inches separate us, I swipe my hand across her long hair and swoop it over her shoulder, exposing her back."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,9,"My eyes fly back to his dark ones, and though his are narrowed, mine are wide and round."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,"It started with a lemonade And ended with my heart This, my pretty reckless rival, is how our screwed-up story starts Age Fourteen."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,44,I stare.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,11,It would be the first time in years the three brothers all found themselves in the same room together .
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,18,I reached out and ran my hand down his shirt.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,9,"“Well?” “Thank you for the roses,” I whisper to change the subject."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,15,“Come in.” The sound of his husky voice drifted past her memory and grabbed her in a choke hold.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,6,"She’s highly suitable for a variety of roles, and she’s an amazing actress, but objectively speaking, Raven truly is something else in terms of beauty."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,8,"""Don’t correct me."""
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,21,"And when she looked over its little round head, she found that it was held in one burly arm by the young forward Castro."
Sara_Cate,Praise,18,I keep waiting to be scolded like a child.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,14,"But I also recognized talking about it with him now, when we were starting out, wouldn’t make him move an inch."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,5,That was it?
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,8,"Brenda disappeared into her room and reappeared with a sort of tablet device, her laptop, and a smartphone all being of the same brand."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,8,Maybe six.” The heat that flashes over me is intense.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,27,She fluttered over to Bob’s desk as he was packing up and talked with him for a good five minutes.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,16,Annie felt a headache coming on just looking at her.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,23,You do the dirty work and make sure I have access to him.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,14,"“I paid a little extra.” “It looks so good, I bet it’s worth it.” “Your reaction is worth it.” I smiled at him."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,5,I had learned from experience that a conversation beginning with that question never tended to go well.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,Immensely.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,15,"We’re on our feet, yelling."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,22,Her emotions were on overload and her body was clamoring for more.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,20,He’d wanted to shift the topic from Eli’s leg.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,9,I want to launch a whole new look.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,25,"Even
though I wasn’t looking for a relationship or to get attached to someone, I
thought he trusted me enough to tell me something about himself."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,49,She parts her legs and I step into the space between them.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,20,"Touch me like I know you want to.” “Fuck,” he mutters darkly against my ear in a tone so low, I know only I can hear it."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,10,I’d nearly trademarked this bitch in my family.

Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,6,"Despite being busy, he’d found time to fall in love with Stella Devine, the granddaughter of Mrs. Gardner next door."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,41,"It wasn’t just her, either; even Edward had cast disapproving glances my way when he thought I wasn’t looking."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,5,He wasn’t stupid enough to leave the photos lying around behind an unlocked door when he knew I’d be here tonight.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,12,"“I will miss you too and your wonderful peanut butter cookies,” Jasmine said with a little hitch in her voice."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,11,He lowered his head so his mouth stopped inches from hers.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,6,“What are you going to do?
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,22,You think you deserve this cock?” His words bite with a harshness that is more filthy than cruel.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,32,Please.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,3,"We can meet, explore options, and you can choose from there.” “That’s really kind of you, Mother,” Brian says."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,7,I wasn’t picky.
Katy_Evans,Boss,16,"“I’m glad you could make it,” Kit finally says, a muscle working in the back of his jaw as he holds my gaze."

Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,5,Where would it be?
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,24,"If you love the building as much as you claim to, you’d support the efforts to increase the traffic."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,25,I turned back to the bartender just as I saw Declan take a step toward me.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,9,"Emery was not common at all, and the light bulb would have registered immediately."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,21,"Hunt, Lana is in town early."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,18,"Low enough to skim the tops of her breasts, but high enough to keep things appropriate."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,6,“Then you should remember that standards are built from the designers and artists that create them.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,10,"I had a hard time keeping my hands to myself when I was around her, and getting involved with her romantically definitely had to be some kind of HR violation."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,19,"“Tris,” I breathe as I feel my resistance begin to wane."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,12,"Well, except Emily."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,13,"""At least, I don’t lie."

Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"A flood watch was announced after lunchtime, and later it was changed to an actual warning."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,23,"To my surprise, Wes took Lexi by the hand and walked out with her."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,2,“Do you really think I’d stand here and slurp wine if I hadn’t brought them with me?” She balanced her glass in one hand and dug through her briefcase with the other.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,33,"Because if it is, you’ve really outdone yourself on
this one.” Once again, I brought the bottle up to my lips and finished off the
scotch that was inside it."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,21,“I can’t do it.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,8,Things were feeling good.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,34,"I thought about it today,” Julian admitted in a murmur, pulling my leg over his lap."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,34,And I hated that the first person I wanted to call was Kline.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,17,"So, I couldn’t live any other way now."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,48,Our lips connect and there’s no softness to the kiss.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,14,"At about quarter after five, I was standing at the counter helping Felicity with her spelling words when I heard the back door open."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,46,“What flavor today?” “Mascarpone and Nutella.

Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,6,"If not for her insistence, they wouldn’t be standing here today."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,31,"After Nick and I had broken up, I’d promised myself I would never let a man make me feel like I wasn’t good enough."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,11,"His face etched to perfection, creased with puzzlement as he finishes his task."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,35,“We’re not discussing this.” He shrugs.

Sara_Cate,Praise,4,"Naturally, there’s no answer."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,8,“I don’t know if yours is the same or not.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,7,She pulled back and looked up at him with red rimmed eyes and tear stained cheeks.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,6,"He probably thought of it as foreplay, and even after he got in my pants, I’m not sure he wouldn’t withdraw his offer."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,17,"“My body missed you.” I need to make him forget where he is, who he is."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,29,"Again, I’ll have to be quick so that they don’t alert Alexander inside."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,1,“Let me guess.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,38,That they want your pleasure as much as you do.” She’s right.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,7,"“It’s better that we haven’t spoken,” I added."

LJ_Shen,The Monster,7,"I pressed my lips against his ear, feeling his cock, hard and thick, pressing against my stomach."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,28,"Let me worry about Thatcher’s boner, and you just concentrate on Big Dick.” I smiled to take some of the sting out and hoped she’d understand."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,21,“I love it when that happens.
Katy_Evans,Mogul,22,Just like this.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,7,You were worried about your resort so you romanced me.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,29,"I stuck my hands in my pockets, my heart aching."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,14,"It’s like riding a bike.” “Except you have large hands now,” I say, and not in any way like I think it’s hot."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,13,"“Yes, and we can go over all the ways you can be flirtatious without crossing the line."

Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,11,"""I'm sorry,"" he said."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,6,"She stares back, spine straight, shoulders hitched back."

Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,6,“He stopped being nice to me.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,2,"Anyone who referred to this man as ‘handsome’ should be tossed in the fieriest part of hell, because that wouldn’t just be an understatement, it would be a sin against descriptive words and assigning them to their rightful places."

GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,16,This is the worst day of my life.

Tia_Louise,Trouble,23,"Double-checking my phone, this is the address listed for Courtney’s name."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,23,"Won’t you remind me?” Dion leans in just a touch, until his lips brush against mine, his touch hesitant, as though he wants to give me a chance to pull away."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,9,Sam bit his tongue .
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,29,“No.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,24,"Kelsey stands and I follow her closely, but when she doesn’t stop at the dance floor and keeps moving through the crowd, I catch up to her quickly."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,28,“You don’t what?” “I know that we have an expiration date.” “Why?” He frowns.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,26,"My other hand drifted to my breast to squeeze as I arched and moaned his name, rolling my hips to give him the same show he gave me."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,17,Too far away to kiss.

Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,Not pregnant.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,53,"Chapter Fifty-Three Dion I look up when my office door opens without a prior knock, my eyes widening when Grandma walks in."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,17,"You tell me.” I frowned when I noticed that he’d finally cut his overgrown hair, but not really, because it wasn’t his usual haircut."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,35,Harvey rambled on though.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,52,That’s what you do to me.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,34,"Next I pick up a few different tubes of maroon paint, holding them together in the light."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,8,"""And your point would be?"""
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,But I do know it was ugly.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,14,"With her ear pressed to his chest, she could hear his heart beating
fiercely."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,35,"“Madam,” said the droopy-eyed manservant, materializing from nowhere so soundlessly I jumped."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,3,"I’m growing tired of trying, and even more so, I’m growing tired of the way I feel every time I see her."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,28,“Not sure I like the sound of that.” I pinch my nose so I don’t laugh.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,20,A visible shiver runs up her spine.
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,10,"Seemed much more interested in you
owing him or something like that.” He stands now, his height towering above me."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,9,“Yep.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,22,"Christos glances around and motions farther down the block, to a tall skyscraper."

Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,3,"“I mean, I know tonight."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,32,"And instead, she’s opening the door wider."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,35,"It was an amazing show, a super funky musical adaptation of Shakespeare in Love ."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,7,"The “close friend” guffaws loudest, and so now I’m wondering if he’s maybe just a good audience."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,11,Or if it’s because I really crave to spend time with him and look forward to these…meetings.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,5,“Excellent.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,"""In a couple of days."

Alexa_Riley,His Alone,31,"She has me wrapped around her finger, and one look can bend me to her will."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,41,"“What are you thinking about?” “About how this doesn’t feel real,” I said softly."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,13,"""I won't argue with that."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,13,"“But I’ve worked up quite the appetite.” And before I can even consider picking up a fry, she snaps a leg off a crab and smiles at me."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,14,Interlocked with that of his brothers.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,18,He glanced up at her and his eyes twinkled in the moonlight.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,23,"“There’s two bedrooms on this floor, and then a little room Hans calls his office."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,2,I want to say.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,How did you keep it from happening?
LJ_Shen,The Villain,6,"Fight , my brain answered."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,6,That’s all right.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,43,"“Signing over guardianship to West was the right thing to do,” I say slowly."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,12,"No don’t try and pull away, let me finish,” he said to her when she tried removing her hands."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,13,Take your wine and hightail it back to wherever you’re staying.” She stomped over to the bedroom doorway just to try to make sense of this odd scene.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,24,"“Did
you two get married or something?” he asked."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,8,I didn’t even apply for it.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,5,"She hadn’t cared about the stupid rumors, though."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,5,"“Bingley—Rebecca will be staying with us a while to recover from a head injury,” he says."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,14,“I guess that makes sense.” “You guess?” He lifted a brow.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,5,But it did it for me.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,8,"“You were like that on the island,” he said as his eyes darkened."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,20,I head to my pile of clothes to see if I can get away with wearing last night’s heels.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,5,"They didn’t even come out here.” “They’re very busy,” I reassure her as I write."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,38,So why does it feel so good to think he does?
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,22,"“Oh, nothing."
Sara_Cate,Praise,30,“I wish you could see how beautiful you are right now.
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,6,He always liked when people flinched away from him.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,11,"“Um, Viv?” “Hmm?” I spotted a gold mirror on a nearby table."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,39,"Seconds later, security catches on and escorts the guy she was with away."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,17,"I don’t.” “Let me ask you,” he says."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,8,"“I want my hands all over them, lifting and squeezing as I kiss the side of your neck.” He does it, placing warm lips to my heated skin."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,4,"One glance and she'd be on her back, opening her legs to me...but that would be too easy."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,25,Tres ?” Lillie’s voice is pouty.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,5,I don’t want to stop them.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,18,Not to mention what walking out would do to her own career and reputation.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,14,"Wouldn’t mind sneaking another taste of you,” he says, before pulling me toward the hostess."
Sara_Cate,Praise,7,The words just travel effortlessly across the table straight from his lips to my ears.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,21,“I sprung for the SUV since I’ve yet to get a handle on your luggage habits.” I jerked my head to the back and slammed the hatch.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,6,"If you are, then I am, and this is the best day we’ve had in a long time.” “One of the best,” she agrees."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,10,He now fully owned Dreamscape Enterprises.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,54,I hadn't made a sound.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,12,"There's been a lot of
water under the bridge between us, and I just want to start hearing the truth
from you."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,23,"So instead of crawling on my knees, continuing to beg for the forgiveness I knew she wouldn’t grant, I decided to give her something else, something she’d appreciate far more."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,8,"“Just tell me you didn’t fuck that loser painter of yours.” I cringed at the thought of Steve’s soft, spindly body."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,43,"I shouldn’t have left the files somewhere where she could stumble on them, but I’d wanted to keep them close and couldn’t bring myself to throw them out after all these years."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,33,"But it went fine, and Lauren was able to relax as her pain became more manageable."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,56,For myself.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,"""I'm not going to discuss my love life with you."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,38,“There’s no way in hell I can let you keep doing this.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,32,You inspire me to chase my dreams and drive away my nightmares.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,4,“And your phone is in the hot tub.” “Then I’ll use your phone.” “It’s in my pants.” He grinned.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,10,He kept me moving forward.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,32,And the best part of that revelation was that we were both certain.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,35,"When the bids hit six figures, she gasped, her gaze ping-ponging between the men."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,25,"Being joined with him is too much truth, suddenly."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,14,"That's why I wanted to talk to you myself."""
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,21,"With a sigh, she tiptoed into the suite’s living room and crept closer to the peephole."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,18,“I did not call him stupid.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,6,And because it’s a habit.
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,9,"You guys try to not harass anyone else I work with, mmm- kay ?” Ares levels a look that justifies his name."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,29,Mom is the one who kept back the shirt.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,12,Turned out to be the best thing he'd done since quitting as CEO of National Paints.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,13,"“I missed you.” “Well, now you’re here."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,31,.” “Mother!” She laughed.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,18,"“Grace,
I need to talk to you.” “There’s
nothing to talk about, Jamieson.” “You’ve
been ignoring my text messages and I want to know why.” “What
text messages?"
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,31,"Trying to push a flaming corkscrew spiral behind one ear, she stiffened her spine, trying to make herself appear taller than her five-foot-three height."

LJ_Shen,The Monster,8,"When I came back, she cornered me between the fridge and the kitchen island."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,57,"She made you feel welcome and loved, no matter who you were."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,19,Co-existing in the eye of a storm we’d been thrown into.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,17,"Of course there are towels folded neatly and stacked in an outdoor linen closet, along with anything else you might need while swimming—goggles, sunscreen, and even those little plugs for your nose."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,39,Threats like that only served to get her riled up even more.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,6,What’s his name.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,10,"“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” “Don’t play games with me, Ronan Kade."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,9,He grins.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,10,"“I’ve missed seeing you, Gretchen."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,32,"“You’re up early.” “I’m working on East Coast time.” He lifted his head, his brow smoothing when he saw me."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,10,I’ll be ready.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,34,"Good luck with that!” “Your new position as associate editor has been approved by the board, Joellen,” says Portia calmly."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,1,I blink.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,5,"“There can only be one queen.” She laughs, like it’s all a big joke."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,44,The hell?
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,8,Her pensive expression breaks into a smile.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,31,I went to check my card on the long table containing the names of the women who’d attended.
Sara_Cate,Praise,33,There I was ordering a turkey sub with Emerson Grant’s hard cock pressed into my back while a vibrator nearly made me orgasm in the middle of the word mayonnaise .
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,5,And then turn and try to look natural.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,15,"I feel horrible every day that I failed them.” “You didn’t fail them, Mack.” She put a hand on my leg."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,21,We are not yet ready to move on to being okay with this.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,5,"We were both working, and on my eighteenth birthday she was waiting outside for me.” Anna rubbed her hands together, trying to do everything she could to keep her emotions in check."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,2,He proposed marriage to her that night and she said yes.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,13,I laughed more than I had in weeks.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,9,“But you know Sadie’s not like that.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,60,"She’s right, of course, yet somehow I can’t accept that she is."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,21,"His eyes widened, a drop of sweat trailing down the same path the barrel had made, exploding on his neck."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,5,I mean…I didn’t really want the date anyway.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,12,"We can see if we’re truly compatible or if we’re just caught up in the madness of it all.” She suspected that she was still head over heels in love with him, but dating meant that she’d have him all to herself and that they’d be on familiar territory."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,4,You have my word.” “Your word doesn’t mean anything.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,16,"Because Emmabelle, my darling, I would be sorely disappointed if you win.” “But not undeterred,” Sam muttered."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,12,“Champagne?” “White wine is safer.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,4,"It’s really true.” I glanced at a woman laughing near the pool, reluctant to get in."
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,9,"Lucy ran a hand through her short
blond hair and continued storming across her office floor."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,33,ME: You alright?
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,36,All we need is each other.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,15,"""Dane."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,13,Can you run it now and just cash me out later?
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,41,THIRTY-FOUR B IANCA I was singing loudly and badly in the shower when the glass door opened and Jackson stepped in.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,1,"I am gaping, and it’s not only because the words complete the image of the man I’ve loathed from the moment I first saw him at the wedding of one of my best friends."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,28,I’ll never be her.” I run a hand through my hair and stare up at the ceiling.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,4,"“I told my sister.” “You what!” “I told my sister, Ellie."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,11,There’s nothing to hate about it.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,13,"Maybe it’s the wine, too, but it’s nice to sit next to him, surrounded by his scent."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,20,Miles has a folder of information about him.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,30,“Get some rest.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,19,"VIVIAN Dante’s parents were the opposite of their son—free-spirited, effervescent, and gregarious, with quick smiles and somewhat inappropriate senses of humor."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,9,"""Oh?"""
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,11,for a while.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,29,"“Look,” I said, trying to stay calm."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,10,Breaking her spirit is half the fun.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,3,I don't even want to think about the loan bills racking up with every day that she remains in here.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,Other than Mom—who probably figures I’ll never be a true ballerina so the least she can do is dress me up like one.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,43,“Juste une minute.” (Translation: Just a minute.)
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,2,"“I think you’re a sexy guy.” And before I could catch his expression, I turned back to Violet with our drinks."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,15,Friendly.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,18,"""We're going to have the rest of
our lives to find out everything about one another."""
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,2,I remember the first time I ran into her in the hallway of my dorm.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,40,"“This is Bernadette Locke, head of the Locke Foundation, the entity that funded this wing, the medical teaching and research facility on the other side of that skyway, and probably your paychecks.” I straighten."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,3,“There he is.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,"“But that terrifies me.” “Understandable,” Lottie says."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,15,"Fourteen T heo T urnip Truck stands in the front reception area of the marketing and HR department, clutching a sheath of papers, pretty brown eyes set wide, gaping at me."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,12,"He pulled almost all the way out of her and then drove back in, hitting some magical, mythical spot she’d only ever read about, but never felt."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,16,Why?” I let out a long sigh.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,9,"Most of all, she looked nothing like Nix."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,19,"“Don’t cheat on me, Krissan,” was all he offered."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,18,"Where her twin had been a svelte size two, Audrey was soft, curvy, and just this side of plump."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,He's fighting to retain his image of himself.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,9,“Excuse me?” “You heard me.
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,27,"And the doors locked .” “Chase,” Bro whispers."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,7,Gone.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,17,That’s a bad idea.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,3,"All I can think about is his tight body, the way he could lift me up right now and bend me over this desk before I’d even have time to react."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,4,The presents he’d brought home were apologies more than gifts.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,14,Instead I looked at his chest.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,7,"“Waverly Place, please.” “Okay.” The driver pulls out into the traffic."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,18,"“Careful, Flower Girl.” He wrapped his cold, strong fingers around my jaw, drawing me close to his lips with a snarl."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,1,I shake his hand.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,25,"“You’re right about a lot of things, a lot of the time, baby, but about this, you."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,4,I’m willing to roll the dice.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,3,Nick countered.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,17,Just perfect.” I slide the tip of my finger up through my folds.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,1,“Age?” “Yeah.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,41,"I was shocked and emotional last night, but looking at him right now, I can’t help but feel like he pales in comparison to my husband."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,24,And then I had to go and mess it all up.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,40,"“If I was only molding you into the perfect fake girlfriend or real one for that matter, Clara, I wouldn’t have had you change all the colors in my resort and put a bakery in the center of it that everyone is obsessed with."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,2,Let him get you off twice and get himself off on you?
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,5,"Where are you located?” “2999
Overland Avenue, Suite 212, Los Angeles.” I
hurried and typed the address into google maps while she rattled it off to me."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,17,Huxley and Lottie come onscreen and Kelsey quickly waves.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,17,"On my way out the door, she gives me a bag full of beauty products and tells me I must use the hot oil conditioner on my hair or she’ll make me babysit Fee, Fi, and Fo when she goes to visit her sister in Cornwall in the spring."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,7,"Leaving me with a throbbing center, wet cheeks, and a jumbled head."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,12,Of course you have.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,7,"He’ll think something is wrong with him when, really, it’s just time moving too fast."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,27,"It occurred to me, albeit sadly, that no matter how badly he treated me, I still referred to him as Da, even in my head."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,60,"“No,” she instantly denies."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,22,Everything in here is black.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,29,"Yeah, whatever.” Lynn hesitated, regarding me with crinkled brows."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,21,Where is she?
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,12,To remember how to do what Jordan did.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,41,He’s confirmed that it had been the right decision to invite every piece of shit news reporter and key influencer in town.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,33,"You do something nice for someone, they’re inspired to do something nice for someone else."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,14,"When it becomes obvious that was the end of the conversation, I say, “Okay, then."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,24,"She’s not getting me a goddamn new car.” “Okay, yeah, but maybe it’s something else like lingerie!"
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,35,I was sick of behaving that night.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,5,"I know rich people have access to things us peasants don’t, but the man doesn’t even know my last name, nor enough information about me to put together who I am."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,32,It accidently hit a janitor who was walking past and scratched his head.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,28,"You don’t deserve that.” She rocks back, crossing her arms."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,53,“Where are you?” What if he’s met someone else?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,18,"""But, I can’t—"" I close my palm over her mouth, ""Sleep, Princess."""
LT_Swan,The Takeover,29,“Where did she go?” he asks.
Katy_Evans,Boss,16,"Then I dip myself down to grind up against him, making him moan."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,6,he demanded.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,9,I still haven’t got an email back from him about the Stine project.” She lets out an annoyed huff.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,1,"“Hello,” I answer."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,18,"He'd said it—for the first time in
his entire life, he'd used the L word."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,17,"â€œYou have an inflated sense of your worth as a therapist.â€ â€œIf you canâ€™t afford me, just say so.â€ I snapped more pictures."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,18,"With my building security compromised, the incompetent but annoying shits at Sentinel breathing down my neck, and a thousand emails to wade through, all I could think about was the woman sleeping a few feet away."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,36,I put on the show I needed to put on as the grief swallowed me whole.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,6,"“What is it you need, darling?” Oh, crap."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,21,“I thought maybe you’d ditched me.” “Nope.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,19,"Oh God, just like that."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,4,And just as obvious when she’d turned and glared at him that she hated Reese.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,48,"You, who are able to solve almost any puzzle."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,17,"And yet, I also want him to relax, and that’s what he seems to be doing."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,17,To the reality of us—that he got Meow Squad assigned to his building and requested me as delivery person with an agenda in mind.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,11,"It’s so quaint and charming, and they have a nut butter maker, and I got a sample of the most delicious fresh almond butter that I’ve ever had in my life."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,10,The blood rushes to my groin.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"Even with all the noise outside the wine cellar, the hundreds of people so close by, I felt as if I were in some faraway place."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,5,I’m not taking chances.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,33,Victoria frowns then inches away from Adam.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,9,Something good.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,14,Holy.
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,19,"“Once a dick, always a dick."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,28,"“Okay … um … oh god, I dunno.” He started trembling violently, tears streaming down his face."
Sara_Cate,Praise,29,"This pussy was molded for my cock, swallowing me up so eagerly like it’s putting a fucking spell on me."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,7,"I’d found it helped him in a weird way, like he was an overzealous puppy that needed a pat on the head every now and then."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,31,He pushes up his pelvis and his dick throbs against my hip.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,5,Christ!
Sara_Cate,Praise,36,Eden and I make small talk.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,26,Work has been really stressful.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,13,We are looking forward to talking over things.” Jett nodded and turned to shake everyone else’s hand.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,25,She’d fallen in love with him.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,15,He pressed a fist to his heart.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,34,With me… Next to me.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,24,“What’s your fantasy ?” Her lips go still against my mouth.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,4,She made a mental calculation of the hours left before she could collapse into slumber.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,1,I wasn’t prepared for her.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,45,"When you cut him off like that, you endangered my sisters’ lives, and I didn’t even realize it."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,21,"Footsteps sound behind me, ""What are you doing, Princess?"""
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,13,"“Just a robe, nothing under it?” I shake my head."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,21,"“I was curious, okay?"
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,17,He had too much to drink last night.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,13,"She beamed around the lollipop, her lips swollen and achingly kissable."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,2,I know him very well and he’s nothing like that.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,21,"He wasn’t mean to me, so I don’t get why you wouldn’t introduce me to him as your date.” “Axia, there’s nothing nice about that man."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,45,I ease my dick inside her puckered hole.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,1,"His scent was in my nose: pine and musk and something earthy and fresh, the way the woods smell after it rains."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,4,"The guys that I knew would pay with cash as well, which could be
traced back."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,26,We’re not exclusive.” He chucked the brick and our relationship along with it.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,14,"“Oh, Sara.” I laugh and head into my closet, trying to keep the laughter alive and ignore how nervous I am about this meeting with Aaric."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,19,"Lexi’s eyes moved off her iPad and met mine, and I tried to turn my oh-holy-shit face into a smile."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,14,“I want to know that you love me.” I grew silent.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,15,Huxley: I knew that was coming.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,19,"Also, unlikely.” “Also, happening,” she countered calmly, shoving me toward the door with surprising strength."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,18,I turn to Mia.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,61,"“I don’t have any answers for you, but then again, it isn’t answers you want from me, is it?"
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,8,“Huh?” Griffin’s blue eyes narrowed.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,17,Would they ask Blair and Chey to join them?
Tia_Louise,Trouble,8,"These breasts.” He unfastens my bra as he speaks, and I inhale a little gasp when he pulls me to his chest."
Katy_Evans,Boss,17,But I know from the fast beat of my heart that I’m very much alive.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,1,"""You don't look well."""
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,5,"Steadfast, unwavering, he speaks truth with his gaze, he destroys with his glare."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,32,I love his eyes on me.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,5,Tag knew it.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,23,This is his creation.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,3,She looks great.” I swivel my head to stare at him incredulously.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,6,"Climbing into bed, I settled myself into a comfortable position."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,53,A beautiful big brain tumor.” She smiled.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,8,"Lifting his head from her breast, Sam took her mouth, a dominant claiming that had her moaning against his thrusting tongue and grinding her saturated pussy harder against his cock."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,29,It was something different.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,33,“I don’t think I can manage another one of your movies.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,22,"The pain, pleasure, and adrenaline moved through me as he let go of my neck so I could gasp and then scream in ecstasy."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,9,"And, like, I know you only do casual, so that’s totally okay—” “How old are you?” I cut into her stream of words, already in need of two fucking Advils and one bullet to put me out of my misery."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,16,I thrust the phone in front of her face.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,6,"He hung a left when his GPS told him to, though he knew the route by heart."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,20,"With my back against his chest, I stare up at the tower and try to be in the moment."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,5,“Did you think I was finished with you already?” Pierce smirks as he presses the egg-shaped metal orb against my mound.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,7,He continued before she was able to say anything.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,13,"“I don’t mind either way.” “Yeah, y’all,” Nick said, joining in on Austin’s and Patrick’s camaraderie."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,4,"Do you work here ?"""
LT_Swan,The Takeover,7,"“Tell me, Ariana, what is the one thing that makes you angry?” Elouise asks."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,26,Decline.
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,9,He clears his throat.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,1,My eyes flew back open as I waited to hear it again.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,32,"""But, you need to recover first."""
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,I hadn't planned on returning them to you.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,"""What a pair of busybodies,"" I said in annoyance."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,9,"I’m dizzy with the gentle sweetness of his touch, like he’s petting a tiny wild bird."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,8,"It was the permanence of the potential arrangement that scared her, and her fear of committing herself to letting a man take the lead had everything to do with her failed marriage to Sam."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,6,So you want the big hunk but you’re afraid that it might interfere with your crush on Cade?
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,8,Michael has already gone inside and came back with a plate full of healthy protein in the form of a veggie egg white omelet and turkey bacon.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,18,Her laughter.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,19,"He holds himself deep, and I feel his cock jerk hard inside of me."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,36,Her job?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,36,"""Wh...what's wrong?"""
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,28,"I’m earning a full-time income.” “Perhaps, but it’s not a stable income.” Jarvis pressed his lips so tightly together they were nothing but a slash of white against his brown skin."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,7,Funny.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,24,"I could twist this knife in your heart and you’d have an orgasm from dying.” Licking her lips, she moved in closer to whisper, “You twisted fuck.” She pulled open her blouse and unsnapped the front of her bra so that her savory pink-nipple tits were right there in front him, and Trevillo thought this must be some sort of punishment or something."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,5,"Oh, boy."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,5,“Just one and if I ever feel this way again.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,4,What he found less funny was Eddie's insistence on keeping his own schedule.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,18,I’d guess that putting someone in the hospital counted as my reckless decision this year but whatever I was doing with Lia this week probably came in at a close second.
Katy_Evans,Boss,15,Intrigued.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,22,"“You’re one in a billion, Gloria."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,1,Ridiculous.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,5,"But, yeah, I found a rich man."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,27,Her partnership was with Rita.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,21,My sister wanted to wish me luck and also offer advice about dealing with negative thoughts.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,15,Her legs wrap around my head as her body starts to tremble.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,13,"Eat, sleep, laugh, fuck, repeat."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,31,"I walked
out of the room, and before shutting the door, I looked at her one last time."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,15,How can he?
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,5,He hated to admit it to himself but he was somewhat relieved the man was stepping back in the picture.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,33,"Which means this is the last time Bernadette sees Smuckers, and maybe she knows it."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,13,It’d been too long since I’d had contact with another human being.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,27,My mind goes back to Friday night.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,10,No other woman is ever going to get that close again.” Temperance smiled.
Emma_Bray,Unmasking the Billionaire,6,“I’m not sure.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,32,"Though the lighting in the room was dim, I knew those eyes were glowering."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,20,.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,19,"“I’m leaving,” he said, patting his pockets like he was looking for his wallet or phone."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,21,“I don’t want to return to the real world.” Exactly.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,5,Daylight was too harsh and unforgiving.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,15,Complete naked.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,25,“You were sick.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,14,turned on I am from this conversation?
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,6,"Daphne never shared any of the details of her relationships, though her songs were always teasing about men and breakups."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,9,Year.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,48,"👀 Ares : to be fair, that’s a pretty good idea."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,4,She licked her fingers and leaned back against the counter.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,21,My girl.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,17,In this house.
Alexa_Riley,Devotion,13,He’s standing there in only a pair of boxer briefs.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,7,And creating buildings.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,26,I shouted at employees.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,16,"Congratulations and good luck.” “That sounded ominous,” Becca says, but she’s still gaping at the house."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,16,Because I said so.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,26,"What are the odds?” Yeah, what are the odds?"
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,29,Why does that feel even worse?
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,17,"“You’ll probably scream my name a few times.” “Oh, wow,” she said, dazed at his words."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,2,It was what I admired about him the most.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,40,"More than that, though, I’m forever in love with you."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,50,My senses went on high alert.
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,15,"“You need help,” Zeus says to me ."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,3,Even if the last thing I wanted to hear about was Miranda.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,17,Oz: I miss you.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,31,"I get into line, tugging open Mom’s purse from her bag as I wipe my tears away with my sleeve."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,12,"He
hated working late, as most of his nights were spent with Mandy."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,6,"All the drapes were closed, only one floor lamp was on, and she’d turned on the gas fireplace, so the room was warm and intimate."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,11,•   •   • The sun exploded in burnt-orange radiance over the horizon.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,8,"""Bite me, motherfucker."""
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,9,“I even came in here while you were downstairs turning off the lights to steal a shirt.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,13,She had all along.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,6,Hanna.” I could feel the attention of the others as he greeted me by name.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,4,"""Or at least you were on-track — until you let Poppy Hanniford get under your skin ."""
LT_Swan,The Stopover,1,"“If you were at the desk, would you upgrade women to impress them?” “Absolutely.” I smirk."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,3,"Still, nothing of
her."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,6,That was perfect.” In more ways than one.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,37,“This is Kathryn.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,17,"If you want to be with me, you’ll have to put up with my dirty mouth.” She giggled."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,42,“I’ve hurt you.” “You’ve hurt a lot of people.” “I—I merely wanted you to calm down.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,29,Then we went for a walk and had lunch in a café on the edge of a park and read the papers.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,23,It was the first concern I’d witnessed over my health in a while.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,19,Grace had unexpectedly changed things in small ways and big ways.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,20,“It’s almost not even worth the money.” I rolled my eyes.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,10,And I keep denying you what you want.” Natalio pressed down on my bud with his thumb and I moaned again.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,23,Does he have a sixth sense that he can focus on simultaneously wrapping his dick and reading my expression?
LJ_Shen,The Villain,21,"Now, Paxton’s door taunted me."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,38,"Eating kids is frowned upon, and adults can get rather chewy.” “No, you goofball, the summer camp ."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,29,"The next, I was on all fours, my hands and knees pressing into the rough black carpet covering the floor."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,3,"He had to admit he was impressed how she handled the man, letting him know she was unavailable, while still being polite."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,34,"When we’re alone and the door has closed behind the last person, Portia and I engage in a staring duel."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,9,"Couldn’t shut my mind off.” “And did something trigger this night of unease?” he asked, his voice soft as he rubbed his wrinkled forehead."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,7,What the hell?
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,4,“Would you guys like the check?” Helix asks.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,42,"I think you are, Zoey.” She grinned."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,22,"If you want me to retreat, you need to make it worth my while.” Vasily stroked his chin, considering my proposition."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,4,"“I don’t know how brilliant it was since I walked back freezing and soaked to the bone.” Merina yawned, then drank the coffee she needed more than her next breath."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,7,"Ah, the sfogliatelle ."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,17,He wasn’t with her—and he wanted Maggie to come home to him.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,"She reached out to touch him, but he moved too fast."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,13,I’m relieved when I hear a quick step approaching.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,28,"My other grandmother is in perfect health, but you wouldn’t know it by the way she carries on."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,3,This was just like every other time.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,25,And I busted into a million smithereens.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,22,"Maybe that’s why I can’t get through,” I asked as Harper handed me a glass of wine and my cell."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,22,I check my phone .
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,47,She’s…fine.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,37,Why couldn’t you just ask me?” “I don’t know.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,3,To take some time away.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,9,“You derailed mine.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,23,He set his bag on a fussy upholstered bench and walked over to the heavily draped window to peer out at the city lights.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,39,You get to live with them—that’s enough.” “Mom!” Fletcher cries from the back.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,2,But that was before I proposed.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,8,"It was something she actually enjoyed doing, and the reason her hands were rough and not manicured."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,14,"I took a step back, my eyes never leaving his."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,17,"“I will not have you parading around in skimpy clothes in close proximity just to make me suffer.” “Yes, you will,” I said airily."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,20,"“It was so nice to meet you, Mr. Lancaster.” “Kyle, doll, and the pleasure is all mine.” She smiled genuinely, the beam most women gave to flirtatious old men with something extra, and took off down the hall at a speed-walk."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,38,“You sound like a good mom.” Sutton beamed at that.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,10,His fingers slide through the lips of my sex.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,30,“I can’t tell you how excited I am to finally meet the woman who can keep my Thatcher in line.” “Finally?” I blurted without thinking.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,9,I’m sorry I made you the collateral damage to my lifetime of fuckups.” The waiter chose that moment to show up with Lauren’s soda.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,16,He was the one who’d introduced her to what she’d been missing.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,1,Fuck that.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,"""That's Tamryn."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,19,"Hell, what was she doing?"
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,10,I can’t imagine finding someone I’d actually want to marry.
Katy_Evans,Mogul,2,“Where are you going?
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,12,"He’d fallen so hard for her when he was a teenager, because even though she was the wealthiest kid in town, she’d never lorded it over anyone, unlike her father."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,3,"Nice, but did it really have to be this loud?"
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,"There would be flash-flooding, and her low-slung Pinto wagon wasn't going to make it to the family clinic."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"Without a word, he went to the kitchen and brought back two shot glasses and the bottle with its distinctive black label."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,3,“Sort of.” “Very well.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,1,"Get your mind out of the gutter, you slut."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,22,"She looked gorgeous in a knee-length merlot-colored dress, and my eyes flared as she bent forward and her breasts filled the V-neck of the top even further."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"How long into the cycle do you ovulate?"""
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,33,All my fears and worries stripped away.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,2,"“Have another drink, Austin."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,7,I'm smiling at nothing!
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,27,We didn’t have to wait long as the train pulled up and the doors opened.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,9,"“He’s a very busy man, and for him to donate a week of his time is almost unheard of in the corporate world."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,16,"""Joe Travis,"" he said, shaking my hand firmly."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,67,"“It is.” “I’ll be honest with you, Raven."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,22,Your turn.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,29,My shoulders rise and fall rapidly.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,23,"Instead, I coughed a little, clearing a tickle in my throat and shrugged."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,9,“Touché.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,16,She’s managed to pull up her panties in double-quick time—impressive.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,31,"The weight on my chest eased, leaving me light-headed and dizzy."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,1,I blink; tear my gaze away from the stranger.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,5,"Did you go out with her once?” “Nope.” I shake the mouse on my desk, waking up my computer."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,3,"His wife was back, and nothing was taking her away from him again."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,18,A pure-hearted rake.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,14,"Only Sin-fucking-Sterling, douche-canoe of the first degree would pull a cheap shot like this."
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,15,But at what cost?
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,16,"""Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone."""
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,16,Then I get up and snatch it from her.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,9,"God, did he have another smile?"
LJ_Shen,The Monster,5,They shouldn’t be.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,1,"I’m listening!” Actually, what I’m doing is clinging onto his shirt with both hands, trying to shake the information out of his mouth like he’s a piggy bank."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,20,"Want a beer?” “Yes, please."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,All the prior letters had been penned by one hand—Lula to Benedict.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,29,"“Our generation is trying our best not to follow in their footsteps, aren’t we, cuz?"
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,40,Cody.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,3,Buy yourself something nice.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,9,The shattered pieces of his life lay broken around him.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,10,I’m stubborn.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,25,Why ‘naturally’?
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,9,You were supposed to be my wingman tonight.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,10,"But you keep doing … um, things like that to me.” “Doing things like what?” His eyes danced with humor."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,5,Not that I’m surprised.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,34,Nothing was going to stand in my way.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,13,I jus' need to .
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,11,"I’ve got beer here in the cooler.” He lifts the lid, and I see Coronas mixed with Budweiser’s and Bud Lights."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,18,"“Yeah, you do realize I have a private jet, right?"
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,63,"I’m your sister , Hannah."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,7,I freeze.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,55,For hell’s sake.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"They agreed on natural textures and tones, and furniture with tailored lines."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,19,No one wants to know how you’re actually doing when they ask the question.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,30,"I don’t have a sweater to cover them up.” The voice that left his body was deep and gravelly, almost near a growl full of frustration."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,59,"Now, all I can think about is the disappointed frown she’d have on her face if I smiled back at the lady in front of me."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,8,"He surged forward and pressed her hard into the wall as he came; Trinity barely noticed the cold, unyielding surface of it anymore."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,18,His hands are flattened on the wall on either side of my head.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,4,"Trinity glanced at her watch, and Sam's eyes fell to her wrist."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,53,"She'd seconded Saint's idea of holding a quick press briefing where we'd play the role of happy couple—no strike that—where we'd be ourselves, and introduce FOK Media properly to the public."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,19,"She walks past me, passing under the set’s constructed cherry blossom tree, all the way to the skirt of the stage."
Katy_Evans,Boss,16,"“Work experience, maybe."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,35,It’s kind of sexy.” More than sexy.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,14,"Rounding the corner, I walked us away from the window and out of sight of my captivated audience at the bar."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,9,"And with a date, it seems."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,35,"“You know what, Valentina?"
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,21,But he also honored her right to leave—her right to walk away when he didn’t give her enough.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,3,“I really just expected money for fancy food and vet bills.” Henry pulls out his phone.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,20,Something different.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,12,Feel something.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,22,Love.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,18,"“Random partners are better for team building,” I say, on full Max Hilton arrogance mode."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,11,"“Okay, your dad and I are going out to eat and then to Mike’s,” Laura says as she kisses my cheek."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,8,I fell to my knees and whispered to wake up.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,6,"So sexy that at times, I notice how attractive Huxley is."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,33,Fuck.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,23,"He looks on in a strange detached state, his face full of awe."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,"""You can run, Hardy Cates, but you can't hide forever."""
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,7,Zelma nodded.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,7,Something was wrong.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,18,"“I don’t think you did,” I replied."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,10,The cocky bastard did indeed take me down.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,19,Wonder whose…” He grins when I smack him lightly on his chest.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,9,“Are you really going to miss out on Iain’s birthday party that I planned just to spend an hour asking this girl about her day?” Drew demanded.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,19,“I don’t know why you think I’m still playing that game with you.” “I don’t know why you still think it’s a game.” I take a menacing step toward her.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,3,The laughter.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,"It’s not my place to speculate—” “Audrey,” Brontë interrupted."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,24,I liked the idea that a work event would only be manageable if I was with him.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,9,"“Do you want to know what Mama Conte said to me?” he challenged, his face inches from hers."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,4,"â€œItâ€™s my friendâ€™s farewell party.â€ She followed my gaze toward Josh, who was basking in female attention of his own."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,37,I had a foundation to continue my path and grow into the person I’d always wanted to be.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,46,A cardiac attack.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,12,He was cold to me for a while after that.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,3,"Should I wear it out there, or should I tell him first?"
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,3,"""This is exactly the indulgent approach Eddie's used to receiving!"
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,4,"Of which he’d obediently sat throughout, nodding, “Yes, Father” and “I understand, Father.” He was skidding past thirty-two years of sinning, and his father could still humble him like a lad."
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,2,"Soft,
succulent, sexy."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,18,"You missed our weekly hangout last week, and I got worried."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,14,I chew the delicious blueberry muffin and swallow before asking him my question.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,5,I had a better chance of getting hit by a meteorite than I did running into Christian Harper twice in the same week outside the Mirage.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,22,How big he is.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,12,"Got it?"""
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,8,"He can
mix business with pleasure all he wants."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,9,"“I kinda like it, though,” he whispered to Derek, thinking she wouldn’t be able to hear."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,37,"I’m in the arms of my family, and even in a messy bun and sweat pants, it doesn’t get any better than this."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,12,I guess I won’t be seeing Oz tonight.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,13,But he started it .
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,28,"“Like this?” he asked, his tone demanding."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,38,“How could it not?” Heidi asked.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,7,"His brown hair was trimmed to neat perfection, his eyes golden and flaxen, just like his nickname— mo órga ."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,1,"But me, I’m going on two years now."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,2,A decade of yoga might not even make a dent in Queen Lauren’s steel facade.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,21,"Molly, Aaron, and I are having a crisis breakfast meeting tomorrow, and hopefully together we can brainstorm a plan of action."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,2,My.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,17,"When the economy had tanked, he’d almost lost the bar, and he had resorted to illicit means to keep afloat."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,32,"There will be a seat available.” He
cocked his head and he pursed his lips."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,32,"No, I see…a J?"
LT_Swan,The Takeover,9,"“I kind of like you being jealous,” he whispers."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,10,Byrne and his puppet are out of the picture for good.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,19,She turned to face him fully.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,60,I don’t want to bear witness to the inevitable rekindling of their relationship.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,40,I know when a woman’s gotten skittish.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,31,"I snap the mirror shut and tuck my hands into the pockets of my white hoodie, where I find something small and hard."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,22,"Plus, there’s always that worry in the back of my mind that isn’t sure if he’s at the same place as I am."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,"She held my eyes with absolutely no embarrassment, confirming she knew precisely what I was thinking."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,8,“Make me come.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,23,Lizzie Cooper.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,27,When he's like this...
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,14,"Laughing,
dancing, and having ridiculous conversations."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,6,You’re not fucking me.” I nudged her knees wide with my legs and pushed into her.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,14,"She’ll be there, Grams.” Grandma smiles at me."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,26,And again.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,3,And the problems of all the guys she dated.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,23,I tilt my face up to study her.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,20,"If I hadn’t been there to catch her, she’d have hurt herself."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,7,"It’s the most beautiful cock I’ve ever seen, curved slightly upward at the end, and already glistening with a drop of pre-cum."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,4,“Why do you ask?” “You’re acting strange.” Did that mean she wasn’t acting like the million other women he’d practiced his way too smooth moves on?
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,4,“I think I got used for sex last night.” John covered his mouth as he guffawed like a teenager discovering porn in his dad’s closet.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,8,"“We’ll work it out.” “But Cloverleigh must be totally booked for the season,” Frannie said with concern."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,31,Because you are mine.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,He has a story.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,51,"I wanted to push you along, make you come to your senses and own up to your feelings."""
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,9,"""I know."""
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,36,"Yes, whimper."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,15,Which is not a sign that we’re in sync or that the universe wants us together.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,12,"Tantalizing me, her fingers caress her cleavage."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,13,You’d be a fool to take anything this family has to offer you.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,19,"“Anyway, point is, you say you’re immune to feelings, and I call bullshit on it.” Hunter laughed."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,40,And the world stopped.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,21,"I saw the news just after you left, so I got myself together and came after you.” Wow."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"""Go on,"" Vanessa prompted, as I hesitated before lifting the lid."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,23,"But as much as she loved routine, I loved her more , and it was never quite so easy for a mother to let go."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,43,“You know what I think?” he said in a ragged whisper.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,35,"And how quickly we’re going to get you away from my mother, because that’s in everyone’s best interest."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,16,"That seems absurd to me.” “Well, good thing it’s not your wedding,” Brian shoots back."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,8,"I went over to his apartment Friday morning to surprise him for his
birthday and I found him in bed with my best friend, Krista.” “Oh,
dear."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,42,This is like all of the best sensations rolled into one.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,33,T he New York wind whipped around my face as I opened the door to Gramercy Tavern.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,10,"There were so many people who had so much stuff that had no memory, and yet Anna had none."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,30,I’ve brought the contract.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,2,"Really, could be anything."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,12,"“I have a suggestion, though."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,25,"I saw the light and dark of the world and focused on where the light came from, how it energized itself, and how I could produce light in the dark."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,22,I see you.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,10,"Becca clutched tighter onto Sam’s arm, treating him as a human life preserver, not knowing his job was to make people drown."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,2,I asked not to be interrupted.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,45,"Sheâ€™d been the best mentor I could ask for during the fellowship, and now I considered her both a friend and role model."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,51,How much do I need her in my life?
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,11,“This is a wake-up-call service.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,8,"He stopped asking questions then, eyes too distracted by my chest."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,21,But was I pissed?
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,20,I feel it.” “You can’t…” Finally.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,32,He merely gazed up at me with eyes that revealed nothing.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,25,"“Put out food and water, pet them some, toss them a ball, make sure they get plenty of time to do their business in the yard, and they’ll grow to love you unconditionally.” “So that’s where my parents went wrong.” Oh, hell."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,20,“I kind of like the guy.” “So begrudging.” “I really want to hate him.” “But you don’t?” “Nah.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,24,What kind of psycho rips roses to shreds with her bare hands while screaming like a lunatic?
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,12,"“I don’t know, plant some sort of chip in my bedroom so you knew what I was doing at all times.” “Jesus.” He laughs."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,21,It’s just wrong.” “I know.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,11,"""Do it."""
Katy_Evans,Boss,13,I feel like newborn Bambi.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,8,To the left was the room where I’d slept last night.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,13,"Lia: You’ve lost the last three times, so I didn’t know if you wanted to change it up."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,20,. .
LT_Swan,The Stopover,17,"“Hello, sweetheart.” He smiles softly."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,21,Reid!” I ignore her attempts to get my attention.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,11,“I think it’s great.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,22,You sweat blood for this company.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,4,Not interested.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,40,"The cold reddened his cheeks just right, and the wind tousled his dark hair to look unruly."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,12,I’ll be there in half an hour.” “But .
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,9,Weston straightens.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,13,"If you want to honor your father’s memory, let someone run it who can make it the success it deserves to be.” This is the second time he’s made me feel like I’ve taken a punch to the gut."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,8,I fucked up.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,22,I didn’t know what to do.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,37,“Why are you so invested in my relationship with Vivian?” Luca’s grin disappeared.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,1,"She was a bank investor; he could remember only that much and no more, for he hadn’t been interested in what she had to say when she’d blabbered all night at the Gala."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,13,"“Ryan,” I whisper, and I let my head fall back against the wall."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,21,Hard.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,8,Jensen called out from the pitch about how good Georgia must have looked when she sexted.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,17,"Out of habit, I pulled out my phone and tapped into my profile."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,9,“What is wrong with you?
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,5,No cheerful greetings or questions or requests to put things on my calendar.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,7,"Tonight, she would dream of seething dark eyes, rich panforte , and soul-stirring, carnal kisses."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,3,"The auction is just about to start, but there aren’t any girls on stage yet."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,41,"Every thrust sent me sliding toward the edge of the seat, and my world devolved into a haze of sex, sweat, and heat."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,26,"The next day I can’t get off of work, but I pull together another great lunch—a Korean fried chicken sandwich with spicy dressing that has some of the buildings abuzz."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,18,“So.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,24,"She waited, her eyes trying to cut through to the truth."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,30,"“You know the answer to that,” he muttered, twisting his gorgeous features and letting out a jagged groan."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,6,"For this once she was going to take the support and care that Russ was showing her, and embrace it."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,34,“Downloading the book to my Kindle.” “What for?
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,36,"But seriously, do they not watch TV?"
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,12,On the engagement.” My glare could’ve set the room on fire.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,12,"Although, let it be known, I’d be happy to eat you out whenever you please.” She yelped in agony."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,5,"“Leave it in until you get inside,” he orders."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,2,They were so plump and soft.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,3,A feminine giggle touched her ears.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,20,Reese took a sniff at the inch of liquid in the bottom.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,44,His blue gaze burns into me with an intensity that makes my heart lurch.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,8,"Without really thinking about her actions, she went to the dresser, picked up her wedding ring and slipped it on her finger."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,11,"You enjoy showing off your cock?"""

KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,17,High praise from him.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,25,And it was a bad joke at that.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,16,"Tell me how wet you are.” “Tell me why you’re hard, first,” I counter."

Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,22,"But there had been a time or two when sex was not playful at all, when we breathed and moved together until it seemed Jack had brought me to the brink of something, a kind of white-hot transcendence, that startled me with its force, and I drew back and broke the momentum, afraid of what might happen."
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,23,” Every last one of my coworkers is staring at me like I’m two buns short of a pack.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,40,"I think Daisy might actually fall asleep on her feet for a while, but when the first light of dawn breaks through her gauzy curtains, she straightens and pulls back with a look of sheer determination on her face that makes my heart stop."

Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,14,"But what they lacked in exuberance, they more than made up for with intelligence."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,27,I mouthed a thank you as I grabbed my cell and stared at the number.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,12,"“Be nice, or I won’t say the cute thing I was about to say.” She laughed."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,2,But then I’d felt my chest tighten because I knew they’d send me back to Cat later that afternoon.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,18,"I mean, since he told me he wants me, we’ve moved forward in leaps and bounds."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,17,"""In that case, there's
probably something you should know."""

Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,9,"“As I’ve stated several times today and days before, I’m prepared to offer whatever is necessary to purchase this company."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,15,"She’s looking at me like she’s trying to figure something out, but can’t quite manage it ."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,71,"I was so certain that Grandma would instantly accept Valentina, so what the fuck is going on?"
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,22,“You’re the one who keeps pretending it has an end.” He pulls back to study me before nodding in agreement.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,10,I’m good enough to say hello to but not goodbye?” I cocked my head at him.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,8,“Quite the speedy nuptials.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,24,"Then you’ll have another one with my mouth, and then a third one with my cock
buried deep inside that beautiful pussy,” he softly spoke."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,23,"“We’re going to Dallas!” someone shouts, and the room erupts in more joy ."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,59,"I nod and help her up, and she stands aside as I walk up the stairs, the steps creaking underneath my feet."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,"She grinned with pride, crawled over to the tub, and grabbed a washcloth."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,19,"I mean, Jesus, you’re a hockey fan."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,10,"“At first, I didn’t want to believe him."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,16,"Does she—” “Jesus, Violet, do you know our brother at all?"
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,10,An entire strip of condoms had been left at the bedside.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,7,"She felt like an idiot for creating a love spell, but she had no options left and little to lose."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,60,I don’t want you to go through that again.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,49,Always trying to kiss ass and one-up me.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,19,"“You’ve got your sisters, you’ve got an ally in this Radley woman, and you have me."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,"Such a girl.” “Yeah, such a girl,” Robert mimicked."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,38,"“I always thought falling in love would be such a brutal twist of fate, after everything I’ve done to avoid it my whole life."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,16,Look at me rest.” He held perfectly still.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,19,"Mouths connected, I pick up my pace and thrust harder, quicker."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,32,"It’s not only that I want to succeed, that I want the Kelly name to be attached to good things—not bad—but that I also want to prove to Christos that he was right in believing in me."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,9,"A relationship is a goal, too, but it can’t be the only one, and it can’t ruin your attention span for the rest of your life if it’s going through a difficult patch.” “We’re hardly in a relationship, Gram,” I protest."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,22,She’d planned our outfits and made sure we had transportation for the night.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,20,"If I’m honest, that need has been building all week."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,14,"“Why would we do that?” “You know, so I can…earn this chair.” “Seems appropriate that you earn it right where you are."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,5,"“Call Sierra and tell her that Andy leered at Raven the whole time I was there with her, and that I want him gone."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,20,"Emotion gathers heavily in my throat, and my eyes start to sting with tears."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,20,"“Just let me set this up, and I’ll be there.” She’s not happy, but after crunching the numbers, I can’t pass up an offer."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,34,"He’s bossy, and he’s usually right."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,13,Don’t turn around.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,12,"Like scalding lasers, his eyes fixate on me."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,22,This wasn’t in the contract .
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,7,“He’s the son my parents never had.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,12,No condom.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,13,"I looked up to see his stare flickering between the door and me, his expression a cross between high alert and higher anticipation."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,20,"Quick, coddle her."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,2,"Someone you’ll never see again and then when you find someone you really like, you can have a relationship and the sex.” “I liked Andrew."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,26,"What I feel for you is so fucking real and true, bit.” He holds the back of my neck in his warm hand, meeting my eyes for a long moment."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,17,"Shaking, I whisper, “Um.” Behind me, sheets rustle."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,18,"Christ, I love it.” “Really?” I ask."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,9,"I added a shawl in case I got cold, checked my teeth for stray lipstick, and steadied myself with a deep breath before I returned to the living room."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,21,"Nora didn’t want us flying to
Seattle and she made sure it didn’t happen."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,22,"“I won’t ask you for anything in return for finding your grandmother, Valentina, but give me this much."
Emma_Bray,Stalked by the Billionaire,4,That comment had only made me blush even deeper.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,33,“I’m sorry.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,36,. .
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,11,Did your parents move?” “No.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,18,The moment shimmered with promise.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,14,“Forget you saw it.” “Claire Anderson.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,7,"His cock sprang out, hard and thick."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,7,"""But I do love the movie."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,68,"He’s intent on destroying her, and he doesn’t seem to realize that in doing so, he’ll ruin the few parts of himself she left intact."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,3,She hadn't worn it then either.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,29,They couldn’t see us from the front.” Thomas.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,5,"She was teetering on the edge of orgasm, ready to plunge off the cliff to ecstasy."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,24,"I can tell her everything that happened, back you up.” I shake my head as I slouch in my chair."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,28,"“Chill, Trev, chill,” Natalio said, laughing."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,19,"But still, this isn’t Oz."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,44,"“I
already sent them a group text message, sweetheart.” He took hold of my hand
and brought it up to his lips."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,23,All of it.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,8,My family owns a business in that same area.” Rip stiffened as a surge of anger rushed through him.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,27,"However guilty or shameful, I wasn’t going to give in to conscience and apologize for my actions, because the last time I saw this man, his cock was in another woman’s mouth."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,3,Someone is pounding on my front door.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,4,"Her touch, her kisses, the flow of her hair about her shoulders, the pulse of her blood at the base of her neck, at her chest, between her thighs… Why do I want to acquaint myself with every goddam nook and crevasse of her body?"
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,29,I liked to be able to control when I was able to tell someone about my son.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,14,“I had no idea Remi could sing.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,12,Now we have to hire a new assistant for the office.” She pursed her lips as she thought.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,18,"""No wrong impressions here,"" he murmured."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,30,Me: Not a good idea.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,29,"In fact, he’d become more inventive about the ways he could get them to quit."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,3,"""But then you always do."""
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,32,The hair on my forearms stands on end.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,32,"There wasn’t enough time for a tour of the “house” before dinner, so we went straight up to Jackson’s room via one of the elevators he informed me were scattered all over the place like gopher holes."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,23,"She pressed her ass into my dick, and her tits swung out in front of her just enough that I caught a peek of her nipples from above."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,40,"He never forgave me for going into
neurosurgery and I never forgave him for being a lousy father and for walking
away from my mother when she needed him.” “Where
did your mom go?” Grace asked."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,8,Hence my suppositions of her disdain for me.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,9,She’d done the right thing.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,8,"I sank back into bed and pulled the covers up to my chin, trying to fall asleep again even though I knew it was a futile exercise."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,7,"""I'm not... he's not...give me that."""
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,5,"And all I could think was Never again, motherfucker."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,20,“I found home with you.” She turned.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,5,"She had a cake ready, and we celebrated my birthday, and our freedom."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,18,“Oh.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,4,"They’re simply offering up an hour, whether it be for drinks at the bar or in a private— or less than private —room."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,8,"She hated being out of town right now, wondering what trouble Vince would stir up."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,40,"“What?” “He said he’s not coming back, Mom."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,20,Be the wife I need.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,18,"""I see."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,19,Six.” She stuck her hands in the back pockets of her shorts.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,1,His lips curl.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,15,"He leaves for London on Monday, I think—not that I would know if his plans have changed."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,7,"He draws himself up to his full height, walks back toward me."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,5,“Don’t argue with me.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,6,"Sorry.” A little sheepish, I lifted my shoulders."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,24,"With a sigh, I stripped out of my work outfit and into sweatpants."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,13,Oh my god.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,10,"I've always heard that size doesn't matter, but I can't help wishing he had more to offer in that department."
Sara_Cate,Praise,26,"When I bring him his coffee, he touches my bare legs, running his fingers up the inside of my thigh and making me want to explode, but I stay in character."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,44,My head starts to feel heavy and out of sorts as Ronan steps down from the low stage and walks toward me.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,13,"“You’ve just never noticed before.” He took a step closer, anger rising inside of him like an unstoppable tidal wave."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,28,"“Be my
guest.” I nodded with a smile."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,8,"In my heart, I believe she thought he would finally make her his wife, and pull her out of the dump he’d thrown her in."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,14,"“I know, babe.” He winks."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,24,"“She was the bravest, boldest woman I’d ever met,” he continues."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,15,"You didn’t climb into my lap because you wanted a raise .” Her cheeks stain a deeper red, and she looks away."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,5,He looks approachable in pajama pants and a white T-shirt.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,2,"My vision tunnels and the blood thunders at my temples—anger…and frustration…and jealousy… Yeah, bloody hell, I am living with rage that she’s giving all of her attention to that…that… Usurper… I am going to teach her a lesson about ignoring me—one she won’t forget in a hurry."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,28,I want her here.
Katy_Evans,Boss,11,"Well here I am, Kit."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,14,The sugary-sweet smell was what I always associated with Kimber.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,6,"The hand on the back of her neck was cool and
steady."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,11,"This is… it’s wrong, baby."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,20,“Ryder!” she called.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,17,"“Yeah, honey."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,7,Why is he asking this?
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,8,"Maura sank into a deep depression after, especially since she had no living relatives to lean on."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,8,It wasn’t because I was a prude or saving myself for marriage.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,12,"“Cancel the rest of my appointments, and take the rest of the day off.” “You’re sure?” “Yes.” His brother needed him."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,9,It had been shocking to Audrey to hear him suggest such a thing as part of their dare.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,13,Is she killing me with kindness?
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,33,“Yes.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,37,"“Tall, curly dark hair, black dress."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,23,"He glances at me, then at his wife, then back to me, before addressing Millie."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,2,"Max started walking, his rational mind working automatically, knowing he needed to get her through the park and to the road where they could meet the ambulance."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,6,fired?
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,22,Fright?
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,36,In a shower of peanuts came a shiny pink-sequined unicorn with a ribbon tied around its neck and a letter attached to it.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,19,"You lure my girls out of the club again, I’m done with you."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,43,"If the
cake inside is blue, it’s a boy; if it’s pink, it’s a girl."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,36,"They made for such a beautiful picture, and I finally realized why he refused to see me.” I squeeze my eyes closed and inhale shakily."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,1,"I’d covered every base, hadn’t I?"
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,3,He hesitated.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,14,"“Thank you, again, for tonight."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,21,"“Yes, but don’t worry."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,44,He wasnâ€™t capable of it.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,11,"Somehow…the curses didn’t bother him at all…they made his chest ache with tenderness for the only woman who had cared for him, cared about him, other than his mother."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,23,I just knew how vicious life could be.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,9,"“So, did I miss anything?” I asked."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,62,I turn the shower on as I try my hardest to articulate the thoughts that haunt me.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,13,"Which should be the grossest thing I can possibly think of, or at the very least off-putting, but it’s exactly the opposite."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,25,A shiver of hair on his belly when I put my hand down there.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,3,She sat up straight and blinked at him.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,29,I had let all of the day pass without calling or texting her or barging back into her place.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,But some people—like me—just can’t help themselves.
Sara_Cate,Praise,17,Just be yourself.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,22,"“Ring up the new box, please."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,11,"“I wouldn’t joke about something like that,” I said softly."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,15,More than gaping; she seems positively frantic with alarm.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,3,"He gave up on eating the terrible food and sat back, drinking the muddy tasting coffee."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,36,Me.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,14,I chanted in my head.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,10,I sucked him deeper and stroked him harder as I flicked my tongue against him in rhythmic movements.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,8,"At this moment, I decide that I’m not going to let this woman out of my sight."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,5,"It allows her creativity to shine through, and she still operates in the industry she grew up in, without being subjected to the very worst parts of fame."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,26,Anything to make her give me the goddamn Gulfstreamer.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,16,He’s probably in his late thirties with shaggy brown hair and kind brown eyes.
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,18,"It took Alicia less than a second to realize that tears ran down her cheeks, too."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,29,"Now, don’t tell Garrett I said that."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,18,. .
LJ_Shen,The Villain,5,"“You want to put my twenty-seven-year-old brother as the head of Royal Pipelines because he managed to impregnate his wife?” I inquired, my voice calm and even."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,41,"“I appreciate your tip, and I love you very much, but I don’t think a cat dad sweetheart is what I’m looking for tonight.” “What?"
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,61,"She groans and I swallow the sound, continue to kiss her, as I kick my hips forward, impale her to the bed."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,26,“You really have to ask?” “You tell me why.” Suddenly a volcano that I didn’t even know was there erupts inside of me.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,14,Come play with us!” a girl in a teeny-weeny bikini shouted.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,14,What looks to be fresh tortillas are stacked under a warmer.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire's Toy,1,I’m on my way.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,29,Make sure he knows what you’ll stand for and what you won’t.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,24,"So I tug her hair, angling her face upward as I lean in for a harsh kiss."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,14,"My brain was saying, Walk away."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,13,"Sierra is buying the grounds the hotel I was visiting is built on, while Zane is acquiring the hotel itself."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,14,The kind of man who takes piano lessons in his spare time because he needs to be good at everything.” “I learned to play when I was young.” “Of course you did.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,44,"I’m sorry, Kinsley."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,62,There are strands of dark gold woven between the darkness that pours down to brush the nape of his neck.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,8,"She was supposed to be a shallow, spoiled socialite who cared nothing about anyone else."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,38,But who cares?
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,15,"“Shoot!” Without another word, I whipped off my T-shirt and held it up to her face."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,10,"""This is wrong,"" she said."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,20,And that was all she needed.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,34,"“Why can’t I be here to do both, Raven?"
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,38,The fact that she wielded the news like a weapon just showed how desperate she was.
Alexa_Riley,Devotion,20,Will Liliana fight or let Alexander have his way?
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,7,"Over and over throughout the flight, he gets me close to orgasm."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,6,“I dated Chris for five years.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,19,"And that’s how I keep her, on the edge with every press, every lick."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,10,His stare was too much like a glare as it raked me over.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,9,"It was faded, but had minimal fraying and no pit stains."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,6,"It's open,"" he called out to his brother."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,15,"“You’re even more of a dickhead than the rumors let on.” “ Dick is the operative word,” he grumbled, stomping his way to his room, his eyes still on me."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,28,“This afternoon I’m cleaning my house and then tonight I’m having dinner with my brother.” “Okay.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,21,He could play it off cool and test the waters.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,32,“You haven’t even started it yet?” “There are one hundred and forty—” Tristan mutters.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,13,"The faster we could get it done, the sooner we could cease communication."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,8,"She never pulled rank, and she insisted on living life as a normal college student whenever she could."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,30,Then his own caution steps in.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,4,"You missed your chance to get someone as amazing as me.” I turned and strode away from him, feeling unbelievably empowered."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,13,I part my lips and he slides the food into my mouth.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,"““ Trudy howled in another fit of laughter, then began sucking on her water bottle to quell her hiccups."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,12,"We were relative strangers, but over the last few weeks, it had felt as if we’d gotten to know each other."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,19,"“If I were to reach between your legs right now, would I find you wet, ready for me?” “Yes,” she groans, pushing her ass into my hand."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"As it is, though ."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,11,What kind of emergency?” “I’m bringing someone.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,2,My parents forced me to take her to a dance at her all-girls Catholic high school once—didn’t surprise me she couldn’t get her own date—and she brought a fucking paperback book in her purse and kept her nose in it the entire time.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,40,“Hyacinth would never leave you for this camp or for Hayes.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,15,I don’t think he expected you until later.” “Fine.” She lifted her chin in challenge.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,9,I sink into the grasp she has on my cheeks.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,8,"Don’t even get me started on the reaction I received from men when they found out I was a single, twenty-six-year-old woman with an unclaimed V-card."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,27,“Can you lock up?” The man nodded.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,31,After dinner came the dancing.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,35,"""The kind of chemistry between you two?"
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,15,"Over time, William's anxiety had faded…incessant practice in the form of constant trials-by-fire tended to do that."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,38,"“I’m helping you relax.” Christian and I took turns initiating sex, but I’d never been so bold about it."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,22,"Besides, that stalwart new trainer you have is making me rethink my sexuality,” she said, nodding in the direction where the new trainer I’d hired was heading towards us."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,11,She was supposed to begin taking it in about a week.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,14,"Reaching into the cabinet, I take out flour, black pepper, brown sugar, and the remaining dry ingredients then turn my back to combine them all in a bowl."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,20,Your dad remarried?” “Oh ho!
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,51,“We’re soulmates.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,23,"As much as I have loved living with you and pretending to be a couple, it feels like the right time to step back from the fantasy and remember what’s real."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,23,"“It’s not normal, Reid."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,16,I think I could guess why he hid it from me; he knew I’d encouraged Kelsy even more to stay as far away from him as possible.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,4,His hand reaches out and grips his cloth napkin.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,16,Just putting the lid on it?” “Listen—” “So gay you constantly made fun of Jenner and his boyfriends?
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,2,I’m helping Mandy.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,17,There was no telling the difference between Nelly back then and now.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,11,"Unfortunately, he knew me well enough to pick up on the nuances of my non-answer."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,22,“She’s . . .
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,4,"As the delivery guys brought up the rest of the paintings, I unwrapped each piece from their cardboard, bubble wrap and tissue paper trying to concentrate on something other than Sam Shaw."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,18,"He arranged me in revealing positions, each one more open and vulnerable than the last, exploring with his hands and mouth until I was breathing in ragged gasps."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,10,"A tall, leggy blonde in a filmy green dress leans on the wooden table between us."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,8,"I’ve found happiness in Italy, but if my father needed me, I’d do what had to be done."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,22,"If she could break it, she would, and she did."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,10,â€œI donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,9,"Hunter’s gaze was on her, his focus intense."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,17,Every.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,18,"“You guys got any whiskey?” Blair followed me to the kitchen, and along the way she grabbed a brown bottle off a bar cart."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,13,"Flinging her arms up to
protect herself she accidentally hit someone leaning over her."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,48,I've smelled this scent before; it's someone else.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,12,“We’re heading home from taking the boys to the park.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,1,"Maybe when I hit twenty I’ll send you a plaque or something, but probably not."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,21,"Bye, girls."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,2,"She got under your skin like a sliver of wood that’s always a little bit raw and irritated, never working its way out again."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,23,Was I all doe-in-the-headlights?
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,15,"“I said it was too hard to remember.” “You did a great job.” I inspect our very healthy lunch, complete with organic milk in glasses with plastic lids and metal straws."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,14,But she barely had time to notice these things.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,20,She slung her arms around my neck and was kissing with the fervor and passion I knew had been lying dormant right under the surface.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,4,"A little love and patience, and her dog bloomed."
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,10,"I just wanted to know whether
you liked me for who I was, or because of my money."""
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,45,"â€œDo you want me to stay?â€ He wasnâ€™t talking about the gallery, and we both knew it."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,40,"“A little.” “Good.” Now that I wasn’t so agitated, the ring slipped free of my finger with ease."
Emma_Bray,Stalked by the Billionaire,3,"I think I’d wanted him too, but then his phone had rang and whatever had happened had pulled him away."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,49,"""That’s not what I asked."""
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,24,"Oh, fuck."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,10,"It’s a double sucker-punch, and our near-kiss last night is on my mind."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,6,Everything.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,32,They’re just closing behind us when a strong hand grasps my upper arm.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,31,After last night—” “What…” Her voice fades out as she takes the envelope and looks inside.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,2,She glanced up from the screen and grinned.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,22,Did you get those Mad Libs I sent you a link to?
Rose_Shain,Reverie,40,I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to focus on twisting up my hair to wrap it close to my head.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,37,"I had thought it pretty fancy before, but frankly, Holt makes the decór look plain."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,43,“What was that?
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,7,"It was a themed restaurant, sock hop style."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,17,"""Hmm."""
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,24,"“Will there be anything else?” “Your head on a pike.” With that parting blow, she left, holding fast to the suit jacket."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,12,He smiles down at me as his lips dust mine.
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,11,"I’m powerless at his touch, and if I see anything on his face that’s close to desire, I swear to God, I’ll climb his body like a stripper pole."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,11,Did I basically just invite him to come watch me?
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,35,"* * * STELLA Since we only had two days to explore Kauai, Christian and I packed as much into our itinerary as possible."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,3,"Now let me go.” Just as quickly, he released her and scooped up the phone."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,15,"Now, that robot persona carried over into dinner."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,5,"It says here that … oh, excuse me."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,22,"“I know he’s nowhere in comparison to your lover boy, Axia, but you can’t deny that this guy is scrumptious,” Trudy muttered."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,42,"“Oh my God, Christopher.” She jumped out of
her chair and took him from his car seat."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,2,"“I’m not going anywhere.” They all had a past, and a story to tell, but none of them were going to talk to each other about what they faced."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,54,"""Oh."""
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,38,"Which meant, when he had messaged Cassie, he’d thought he was messaging me."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,20,“I have a not-at-all altruistic reason for asking.” Bree grimaced.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,16,"I scoop her up, cuddle her against my body."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,15,"He scanned them with disinterest, pausing at Preston Stewart’s name."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,25,"And, honey—if it’s really not good timing, you can say so."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,27,Thank you both for being such wonderful friends to me.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,36,I was off on a tangent.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,20,"“You can sit and put your feet in .” She’s wearing a short little knit dress that’s been making me crazy all evening, so it would be easy enough for her to strip off those stockings, sit on the towel, and drop both feet in ."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,5,"And I thought maybe you were avoiding me after...well, after…” “After I told you that I wanted to fuck you?” he asked bluntly, his eyes holding hers prisoner."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,23,"A sound I’d heard before, from another woman, a sound I told myself I’d never hear from Mallory."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,7,"Why is he here?” “Oh, he’s not a bartender."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,38,"""It’s not enough."""
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,30,"And that’s before a dude wearing seventeen gold chains, low-slung pants, and a sideways ballcap strolls in."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,42,“Just your average Prince Charming.” I snorted.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,34,I chew on my lower lip.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,25,I tightened my hands into a ball.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,26,"Staring down at my beer, I quietly say, “She went home with someone else that night.” The room falls silent."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,31,"""Waterworks again?"""
Katy_Evans,Boss,1,"“I think I’ll have a quiet night tonight,” I tell him, as though I usually go out partying rather than slipping into pajamas and catching up on Grey’s Anatomy ."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,17,I felt the loss of it.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,46,I need her.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,16,I don’t want to talk about it anymore.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,25,"We must never be too busy, too wealthy, or too proud for family."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,66,"When I packed this ring, we’d just had our argument, and I’d been wondering whether I made a mistake when I forced you into this marriage."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,37,"“But if you ever touch, look at, or so much as think about Stella again…” I shoved the blade in all the way until the only remaining visible part was the handle."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,36,Declan: Would you like coffee before she comes?
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,28,Simon was going to be her husband.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,7,“Seriously?
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,18,"Do not cry, for God’s sake — I burst into tears, bawling into his chest—loud, ugly-cry bawling, complete with sobs and snot, my body shaking, my hands fisted into his shirt."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,21,"How aroused you are?” She whimpered and said, “please”  before I threw the fabric onto the ground and grabbed her thighs to yank her up."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,55,Ask.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,33,He folds his arm around her and draws her in for an embrace.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,6,Winnie liked it too—she ate two bowls of soup.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,2,"Failing to meet his angry eyes again, I said, “I just fell on my ass, Tico."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,19,"The elevator is taking forever, and I inch closer still, enjoying Henry’s nearness, his strength."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,46,"He takes me by the hand, leading me to the bathroom, and I let him peel off every layer of my clothing, until I’m standing in front of him naked."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,2,“See ya.” She was typing something as she walked away.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,21,Method acting is emotional manipulation.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,21,“Perhaps you’d rather look at my chest.” A sound like a snake’s hiss comes over the line.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,27,I glance around the space.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,32,"I’m not complaining, you understand, just explaining that was our reality."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,15,“Where?” I begin to cry uncontrollably.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,17,"You’re just the trolling best friend.” “Trolling, wow,” I tease."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,15,“Gettin’ this shit off your face.” He starts to gently wipe the makeup off my skin as I lie there wondering if it’s weird that I’m enjoying it.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,30,“Come on.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,24,Dead or alive.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,24,"“I have good contacts.” My default was trust, but I tasted the bitterness of his lie on my tongue."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,11,"“Any snags?” “All standard procedure,” Holt assures me."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,12,He was brooding on the plane to San Francisco.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,29,It’s nearly blinding.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,18,The shadow of hope in his eyes.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,9,And I mean . . .
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,38,"Her smile grew, but warily."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,17,"“We’re all just hangin’ by a thread, babe."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,20,"Traffic was bustling as we drove up 5th Avenue, but that was the New York norm."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,9,To have someone to call my own.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,30,"I turn toward Raven when the door falls closed, barely able to contain my annoyance."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,27,"“You like the way my cock slides against your clit, huh?"
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,4,I have a feeling she’s going to crack any moment.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,24,“I didn’t say that.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,27,"You could make her look crazy if she accused him publicly, if she tried to explain why she left here."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,10,Guess I owe her an explanation?
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,12,And then black on Friday.
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,17,But Alicia deserved to hear the truth before she left.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,8,"She’s on her stomach with her knees bent, her feet crossed, nonchalantly chatting while drawing."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,9,"No man as handsome, kind, and generous should ever know a moment of uncertainty."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,He was so different from all the other men she’d ever met.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,68,What are we going to do?” I grin at her and grab her hand.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,9,I will not give in to my hate… It hadn’t been hate.
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,11,"“Look, we both could use a breather,” he explained."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,20,Sheâ€™s a horrible person.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,10,He got in behind me.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,5,"I’ll have to do my entire route in it, including a likely delivery to Max Hilton."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,2,He narrowed his eyes as he looked at me as if he was trying to figure out whether he could be honest.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,55,"I’m done hoping that someday, you’ll go back to being the big sister I once looked up to.” She looks hurt for a moment, but her pain rapidly makes way for anger."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,14,"""It's Alia from 7A Investments, this is your wake-up call."""
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,43,I didnâ€™t look at him as I fished my key out of my bag and jammed it into the lock.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,6,Right next to him.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,3,"Tara said she's been living with your cousin Liza, and working at a temp agency."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,43,“What?” I cry.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,14,"He kept stroking her hair, neck and back, turning her whole body to jelly."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,27,I had a ton of things to get through.” I smiled up at her as she sat on the corner of my desk.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,3,“She’s staying with Oliver.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,37,Love and heartbreak.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,40,He hesitantly released me and then seemed to realize that I had someone with me.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,2,Gonna shower and head out.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,33,Another groan climbed up my throat at how tight and wet she was.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,41,She’s gone.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,33,"We all climb in, and Sebastian and Spencer and the girls climb into the car behind us."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,45,She holds her body so tightly that her shoulders seem to vibrate.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,8,"At the rate she’s growing, she’ll hardly get to wear any of them before they’re too small.” I pinch my lips together, thinking."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,16,If Crane Hotels had gone to someone else…” He shook his head.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,9,Patton was agitated when Marley entered the room.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,21,Longing was something teenage girls did with Armie Hammer.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,18,Thanks.” My phone beeps as another call comes in.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,7,"It was a lazy shortcut, but she had been able to cook pretty much one handed in the past couple of weeks."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,8,"Nothing about it is sexual, nothing at all, but for some odd reason—maybe because it’s been some time for me, or because she is really fucking pretty—watching her suck the frosting off her finger makes the back of my neck sweat."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,25,They’ll give me another chance to sub.” “No!
Sara_Cate,Praise,41,"Jealousy, maybe?"
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,11,"Want to watch a movie or something?” “Sure.” I took my tea over to the smaller of the two couches and sat at one end, my legs stretched out across the cushions."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,4,What in the actual fuck does he think I’m going to learn from reflecting on what kind of person I am?
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,1,"Please tell me she’s okay,” he growled into the receiver, even though his eyes were squeezed shut with fear of receiving unwanted news."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,5,He was a nice guy.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,19,"The culmination of our argument, however, was being enmeshed in passion, steamed with aggression and simmered with starvation for each other."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,29,Okay.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,10,"I can get my agent on the line if you don’t believe me, and she can confirm the dollar amount.” “Your contract with us states that rent is due on the first."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,10,“And?” “She wants to plan a surprise outdoor engagement party for you guys here on the patio.” I gasped.
Sara_Cate,Praise,32,"“I need you,” she cries, clawing at my shirt."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,19,"“Good morning, Kinsley."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,12,Merina doubted the freak ice storm had been caused by a one-night stand gone wrong.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,22,Wonderful.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,21,We’ll head over to your grandma’s house.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,28,I should have said all those things.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,12,"“Lighten up, Landon."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,12,Patrick was always a good time even if he egged on Austin’s base qualities.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,3,And take it easy when they tell you to.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,11,"“It will, baby."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,48,Her smile matched mine.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,7,"Luca and Lucie don’t have a father.” His face visibly tightens as I say that, his eyes narrowing and his mouth clamping tight."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,2,"I stop abruptly, horrified to realize I’m drawing my own wedding dress."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,My mouth feels dry.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,13,“It looks like you kept her safe inside for long enough because she’s healthy.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,1,"If they were not careful, the men would shoot the women and take off."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,45,"I pick it up and stare at it in my fingers, and a broad smile crosses my face."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,23,"Memories bubble up, of him."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,25,It’s the only way to hold onto his respect… Not that he has much of that.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,10,"Oh, and then some woman cut off all his hair and sold it for thirty pieces of silver?” Lovello just looked back at me straight-faced, and then he blinked, blinked again, then flung his head back and burst out laughing."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,22,"The desert sun shone down across the concrete utopia, glittering rays bouncing from one ornate building to the next, and instead of thinking of something fun to do, all I could think was, I wish Thatch were here."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,22,"Besides, this was only the first session."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,14,"“Ah, yes, a dream moment, I’m sure.” He taps the side of his head."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,4,Cade Archer.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"""What's going on?"""
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,1,“He wants you to throw it.” He glared.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,Trudy watched Tish’s retreating form as she answered me.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,2,"Even lying flat on a table he looked like a tightly coiled spring, ready for sudden physical exertion."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,19,"“Did you order room service?” “No, that’s Derek,” she says."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,37,"He holds up a finger, bending farther under the hood before stepping away and circling it in the air."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,7,“Don’t get me wrong.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,17,"He was on shift today, and he was the one who secretly called for backup.” All our employees at high-risk locations like jewelry stores wore custom watches with disguised panic buttons."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,37,She was in black skinny jeans and a black V-neck T-shirt that hugged her curvy features.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,7,“Come.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,6,"“I appreciate your honesty,” I say stiffly, looking at my fingers clenched around the delicate handle of the cup."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,43,Can I?
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,27,Maybe even more so.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,34,“I want you even more.” “Then you’ll figure it out.” I almost believe he really will.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,15,We talked about this.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,4,"“Eight o’clock is fine,” she clipped."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,13,Lauren inhaled a deep breath scented with both his aftershave and the wine in her glass.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,12,Arrow.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,49,"“Kate is my business, and what happens between us is none of yours."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,5,"She flinched away from him, not
wanting his hands on her."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,40,"He was the sweet one, the one I would call my friend."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,26,“It’s good to see you.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,19,"“And don’t stop.” “God, my cock is so hard for you."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,24,"“D’you wanna talk about your little internet research project first, or pretty boy?” I stuff another piece of bread into my mouth."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,“I see you received your rose today.” “I did.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,8,Chapter 8 I deal wedding weather” was how Penelope Brand had described the day when she texted her congratulations on Saturday morning.
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,11,“I’m not going to crash it.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,2,"Not only does he remember my name, he remembers having talked to me before ."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,27,You branded him on your skin.” Shock blew my eyes wide and I instinctively clutched my towel tight to my body.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,29,"And even though we didn’t speak often, I knew he was someone I could always count on."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,5,I had to laugh at that.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,24,"Then, Emery stepped out, and my hands shook in disbelief."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,35,"He crossed to us, bent stiffly to kiss her cheek, then stood on my other side, using me as a buffer between them."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,24,In him.
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,2,“I’m half a paycheck away from moving back in with my parents .” She’s not the only one who’s strapped for cash.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,27,"Well, after the end of that relationship that never was and which shall never again be referred to by me, I’d stood there dumbstruck and naked and in the bath tub."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,12,Her chin about hit the floor.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,31,But it’s not like I’m about to put on the dress from last night.
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,28,"“I know you don’t believe it, but you’re the strongest person I know, Paige” God, do I wish I could believe that."
Sara_Cate,Praise,29,"She tenses, glaring up at me with wide eyes."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,22,“I’m fighting for that deal.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,18,"Seeing what I caused in her, the lightning over what I thought was a calm sea, it made me feel godlike."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,9,"I hear him open a bottle, spread lube on his cock."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,2,"“Funny you mentioned the contract,” he said."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,16,"If Hannah doesn’t change her mind, she’ll be destroying three lives, including her own."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,17,It has me thinking about Emerson and Charlie.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,16,Which meant I was probably thinking of Emmett’s.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,11,There was no other way to regain her fearlessness other than to be fearless.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,16,She’d strip it off as soon as she got to his office and show him what he’d been missing out on.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,19,I guess he wasn’t a morning person.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,26,“You brought it back to me.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,27,I don’t have to stand out here and look at him.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,4,"Please tell
me."
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,13,"Please, I, I don't
understand..."" He scanned her face but she shook her head and looked
down at her feet."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,40,"Back and forth, back and forth ."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,14,.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,7,Bottles of water.
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,15,She had done it enough times without loading up the coffee first that Eddie had taken to getting ahead of her schedule: he always kept the shots preloaded now.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,5,"Once their iPhones came out, they’d excitedly shared meeting details and talked shop."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,3,"You look a bit … flustered.” “I’m fine, boo,” I answered without looking at him."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,18,"Bet I know for a fact that under that dress, you—” “Clara.” Dominic’s voice cut through the bakery, loud and authoritative."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,35,"Fucking finally , she’s mine."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,35,I meet with a lawyer on Tuesday to start the separation process.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,6,â€œI used the snake as an example.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,43,"I hate that look, have seen enough of it."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,36,And Jackson was visibly wilting with each passing minute.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,6,He needed her to say yes.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,"You have so many.” He walked behind her a few steps, his gaze on her instead of the roses."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,30,I guess Spencer would have his balls if he did.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,14,"Shit, he was being insensitive."
Katy_Evans,Boss,16,I realize very quickly Kit is expert at this.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,9,Not sure they even decided to show up.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,31,E LLIOT I dial Kate’s office; it rings out.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,26,Cass and I caught the train and made it to Barcelona in record time.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,13,"Of course, I’d love to be mentored by him."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,"It might be a while."""
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,12,"""Wait,"" she calls out."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,17,Her Etsy bio suggests she also designs high-end human jewelry.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,26,"It just highlights how naturally beautiful you are, Mrs. Windsor.” Mrs. Windsor."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,14,And that means I’m doubling down on stances I would have usually been less rigid about.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,7,I can’t place it.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,18,"We are,” Gabriel fires back."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,12,just sayin’ My eyes narrowed.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,10,"If she picked up on our hostility, she didn’t acknowledge it."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,17,"“You are his soldier, not Sam’s.” The boy smiled."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,"Rising from his seat, he walked over and stood next to me at the window and both sets of our eyes went to the field."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"But I was stuck, and Vanessa and I both knew it."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,41,"I wasn’t sure if the snake was poisonous, but I acted fast as I fell to the ground and scrambled across the floor, trying to put distance between us."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,23,“Yes?” “Yes.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,24,She wasn’t sure at all.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,16,"They were old friends, sort of."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,30,"“I don’t think I can explain how much this means to me.” “No need, bluebell."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,11,Remember when the mobster made them get married because they had sex?” She moaned.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,8,He grabbed his stomach and said it hurt because he was so thirsty.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,38,And I’d be left with nothing.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,16,"“I do love burlesque,” Devon groaned, shifting in his seat."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,8,"On that old beat-up couch, the TV on, his hand slipping past his waistband to circle his cock?"
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,24,"I figured since you were with Tag and you had a place to stay—” “No penalty from me either,” Rachel had said before Bree apologetically informed her further."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,31,“Let’s just order a new one.” She nods and hesitantly reaches for the collar of my pajamas.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,6,Instead it just raised new ones.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,11,“I just make sure everything is calm and quiet.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,15,"She stared Cassie down for a second, and it was obvious she was racking her brain for the answer."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,22,Since when had I given in to the urge to collect wounded things to my collection?
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,34,She turned and pinned him with what the assistants in the Manhattan office termed the Lauren Glare.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,5,"He pulled up in front of her apartment and walked her to her door, like he always did."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,40,He’s a bright spot in my life.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,51,"“As you may have guessed, I have an announcement to make.” We all tense, knowing that whatever it is, it’ll affect all of us."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,14,Dread snuffed out every other emotion faster than a candle in a rainstorm.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"Take care, y'all."""
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,28,Everything fucking hurt.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,17,"I looked over my shoulder in question, but I kept my body to the door."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,23,"“We’re dressed to make jaws drop, Steven."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,3,“Here’s my card.
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,24,"Turning my face to the side, I lick her ankle and bite down on the inside of her foot."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,20,"“You quit smoking, huh?” Hunter’s gaze flicked to my desk, which now lacked the usual mountain of ashtrays, cigarette packs, and Zippos."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,27,"Sitting around a high-table in our secluded section, I was rocking to the music while half-listening to one of Jahleel’s dancer dudes yapping in my ear, as he tried, failingly, to convince me of how great we could be together."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,4,Play their game.

Katy_Evans,Tycoon,27,"I won’t let him go,” I promise."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,33,Not when she was looking at me with those eyes and pleading with me in that voice.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"""I've heard varying statistics, but I could make an argument that three to live percent of the population has either strong tendencies or the full-blown disorder."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,24,I was faulty.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,17,"Several times, I have him worked up, only to drop him down when I pull back too far, and he accidentally pops out of my mouth."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,13,"""You…you’re joking right?"""

Sara_Cate,Praise,5,So I don’t go back in.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,4,"If that’s her real name, I’ll eat my left shoe."

Sara_Cate,Praise,24,"He existed as the center of my universe, and I was his shadow."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,23,"Have you forgotten
already?"
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,7,"""Was "" I asked dryly."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,28,I’d had a preview with their tongue-tying in the restaurant.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,7,"“What do you want from me?” she asked, her tone light so he didn’t think she was panicky."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,13,"“No wine!” Audrey said, hurrying after her sister."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,28,“She got you a phone?” Skyler eyes me because it’s clear it’s one of those cheap phones you get inside a gas station or something.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,31,"And my family, not that they’re at the top of my list."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,5,"And yet, here I am…really fucking enjoying it."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,21,I’ve been silently watching Christos who has only been speaking to Cole throughout the meeting.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,25,“I was just so hell-bent on having a family again.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,33,"My chest ached, my fingers and toes felt numb, and my head felt fuzzy."
Katy_Evans,Boss,5,I guess it’s not surprising that Alastair has the best spot in the hotel.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,37,“Maybe she’s sick.” “Get real!” Brey bellowed.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,35,I snuck a peek at Christian.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,28,Watch you.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,5,"He reached out a hand toward my face as if to touch me, but then he pulled back."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,16,"“No, I don’t.” “Girls who drift off with that dreamy look in their eyes when talking about a guy always have it bad.” She sat back, folding her arms."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,2,"“Doesn’t look like it,” I snapped."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,27,It would’ve been easier for you to simply say no.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,42,I slammed the phone down and stood.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,35,Every possessive bite.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,30,"I need to feel her naked against me, skin to skin, belly to belly, heat to heat."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,23,"""For now, I am going to take your cunt."""
LT_Swan,The Stopover,22,"I drop my shoulders, take a deep breath, and steel myself for the night ahead."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,42,But Heidi adored the place.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,37,That harsh edge to his voice?
Tia_Louise,Trouble,28,"“Okay, ten-minute warning."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,3,There was not one thing I could say.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,5,How the fuck did this happen without me realizing?
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,12,Her fingers wrapped around the Manhattan before she could direct them otherwise; she turned it around and around as Sam settled in again beside her .
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,3,“Do you see what I’m dealing with?
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,29,I can solve this.” He follows me out.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,23,Julia gave him an amused look.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,44,His rough black beard was back.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,2,"Between that and my hideous shirt and my complete awkwardness, it's a wonder he hasn't ended this call yet."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,26,“Oh yeah.
Sara_Cate,Praise,34,"We’re on the dance floor, and while I’m looking away at something, Emerson’s eyes are focused on my face."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,37,I forgo the underwear and pull on my jeans and a top; then tug on ballet pumps.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,1,Nate looked a little stunned by the full-frontal embrace.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,67,I won’t let him pressure you.
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,25,What I need you to do is be nice.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,34,"” “I’m not asking you to get back together with me, Julia."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,17,My cheeks burned at the thought of her touching him there.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,27,"Because, each time you turn your eyes away from me, I know it’s because I’m reminding you of him.” How right he was."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,41,"It’s true that he reminds me of the reasons I’m no longer looking for love, but it isn’t because I have feelings for him ."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,45,.” “Enough apologies.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,15,"I want to look away, but he won’t let me."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,"She looked into the mirror and played with her wet hair, still dripping from the shower."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,5,"""What?"""
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,14,Anything to keep from thinking about him.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,23,"With me wearing the same outfit as in the video being viewed by everyone , people recognized me over and over."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,5,"We’ll finish this later?” “Sure,” she said with a small disappointed sigh."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,21,“I drove Fletch home.” Her eyes flick between me and Fletcher.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,1,The hell is he doing to me?
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,70,"It’s his own fault for keeping his distance from her for so long, baby."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,32,I’ll need something to sustain me through the next fifty celibate years.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,25,"You’re perfect just the way you are, lass."
Sara_Cate,Praise,2,"You wouldn’t have to hide it or be embarrassed by the kinks that get your panties wet.” “You’re fucking crazy, Garrett,” Hunter replies, but by the time I set my empty glass down on the table, I can’t get the thought out of my head."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,2,Then she exploded.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,22,"To him, our engagement was business, but most arranged marriages still involved physical intimacy before the wedding."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,10,"It’s close to home, so I can pop in for a quick meal from time to time."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,33,"Cutting short a meeting with Wallace Fellers, one of my biggest regular investors, and heading straight for the airport only to chase Georgia’s plane across the country was not exactly precedented behavior."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,16,"Jack had called me in the morning, but I had been in the shower and let the machine pick up."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,13,"My language gets kind of rough when I've been out with the field guys."""
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,7,"“Simon’s wedding reception,” she reminded him."

LT_Swan,The Casanova,11,. .
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,12,“He’s threatening to send the video out if I don’t go out with him again.” “Are you fucking shitting me?” Jordan squares his shoulders like he’s ready to fight.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,24,I hadn’t asked for them; part of me didn’t want to know.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,5,He walked over to her and kissed her on the cheek.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,25,“I don’t think he’s in love with me.” Bree clucked her tongue like Rachel was being petty.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,21,Or maybe that wasn’t a dream at all.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,7,"“Please,” she cried out not knowing what she was crying out for."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,33,"When I tried to move my hands from his face, he gripped them tight, refraining me."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,30,I frown.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,"“Nothing.” He groaned, pulling her hips against his own."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,13,"""It’s him, isn’t it?"""
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,59,"“I can’t drink alcohol right now.” She said it with meaning, like I was supposed to know what that meant."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,8,“YOU shut up .” He does.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,11,"I lift my legs and wrap them around his waist, and the heat of our skin sliding together burns in my core."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,12,I told you I don’t do the love shit either.
Alexa_Riley,Devotion,21,"She wraps her arms around my neck, taking me by surprise."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,3,He decided to call a meeting right away.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,12,“Jude and I started watching that the other night.” Emily glances at her.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,44,"I love you all immensely, and I hope for one second while reading Eyes on Me you felt that you are not alone."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,51,She’s so relentless.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,40,“What’s that face you’re making?
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,21,“Are you in your office?” I ask.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,27,"“You always shake me out of my funk.” “That’s my job, baby.” He lifted her chin and claimed her mouth."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,3,"But when I enter the lobby and find a doorwoman inside, who directs me to the penthouse – “Mr."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,30,I was so very in awe.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,2,I hated that his exhibition at my gallery would be the start of it.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,12,"“If you need to run, I’m going with you,” he announced adamantly."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,7,"His eyes darkened, his muscles relaxed, and he leaned closer before placing both of his hands on the steel counter behind me."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,3,It wasn’t that I didn’t think the gargoyle dick was funny—because it was —but it was really one of those funnier-when-it’s-not-happening-to-you things.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,8,"She handed me the saucepan and pointed to the sink where I dropped it, keeping my eyes on her."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,17,To do things differently.” To do what differently?
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,28,"“Guess what, Trev?"
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,3,And what he saw made him uneasy.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,11,"As my clothes hit the floor, he scooped me off the counter and walked me out of the kitchen and over to my bed."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,25,The view is spectacular.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,10,She pushes her body into mine.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,But instantly I knew that was the wrong thing to say.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,6,She was made from the same mold anyway.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,15,Her eyes glitter.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,37,"“That’s if she wants to, of course.” This is the last thing on earth I want to do."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,2,I have enough in savings to tide us over for a couple of months.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,8,"“Speaking of hook-ups in church?” I said, crossing myself in mock horror."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,7,“He’s nice.” Lukas smirked.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,13,What I see in them takes my fucking breath away.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,"Most of all I want to hold you until you stop shaking."""
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,12,"And stopped, her heart dropping."
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,14,"Norma Anders has always prided herself on her intelligence
and determination."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,6,"“I want to go and dance,” Temperance said."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,41,"We’ll talk in the morning,” I reply."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,13,Maybe he needed to get good and blasted.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,9,"And it made her quiver all over again, the orgasm continuing to rip through her for long, intense moments."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,6,I was interested now.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,1,“We need it by Monday.” “Monday?” I stare in horror at the enormous pile of papers.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,5,She kicked me out first thing this morning.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,9,Not.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,13,“Have you got the management report?” I snap to change the subject.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,12,"“I can’t reach the floor,” she said."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,14,Ambition.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,38,"""Time you learned not to lie."""
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,14,"So I admire him for a moment, the sharp lines of his cheekbones and jaw, and the perfect slope of his nose."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,35,I took a few deep breaths and got to work.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,26,“Not that there are any within a hundred miles.” I couldn’t even smile.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,4,"Why is that so hard for the two of you to
understand?” “Because
it’s not natural."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,22,"I down the scotch and take her out to the floor, moving on autopilot, dancing, chatting, spinning Jana around."
Sara_Cate,Praise,30,"Thanks, Emerson."
Katy_Evans,Boss,15,"Exhaling, I prod myself to move."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,26,There are therapeutic exercises that don’t cost almost three hundo a session!
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,3,And Maddie still hadn’t left the clinic.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,7,"Beggars can’t be choosers, and I know that… but I also know I can’t survive under the same roof as you unless we agree to be strictly platonic and pretend like last night didn’t happen at all."
Sara_Cate,Praise,26,"Only slightly different from who he is on a daily basis, I love this power he manifests."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,24,"“What time is our flight?” “If you make it back by three, we’ll have plenty of time to get to the airport.” “How about I’ll get back by one, and I’ll take you to lunch before we leave?” he offered."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,20,“I cannot believe I just had sex with my boss.” I humphed and squeezed her into me.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,13,He looked unbelievably good and it took everything in her not to run her hands up his body.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,11,I was on my way over and the weather sucks because it’s been raining all day.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,22,Pretend you’re at home.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,7,"They thought Declan might grace them with his presence, like he was a god here amongst mere men."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,12,“And why did you bring Tucker?
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,23,"Ari?” Trevi asked, grabbing the stool next to his."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,2,"Was it the wine, or was she even cuter than the last time I’d seen her?"
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,29,I work on all the biggest projects.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,28,"I’m exhausted, Mom."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,32,"Rolling his hips, he gathered her even closer."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,38,“There’s nothing wrong with her breastfeeding!” I finally got out.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,26,“I want to call my lawyer.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,3,She couldn’t wait to see his face when he realized what their “date” was going to be.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,29,You come off as pretty and pure.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,18,So I’m stuck following the VIPs out of the box and toward the elevator .
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,25,Pretend you never saw this.” It’s only now that the idea occurs to me.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,8,Let me take you to dinner to celebrate.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,4,"Finally,
thankfully, she wavered and glanced away."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,"“Logan, I don’t have anything to wear.” “We can stop by a store and pick something up on the way out.” She grimaced at the thought."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,5,"You have no say in my life and what I do, but I’ll listen."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,38,"We were a family of five ranging from thirty-three to twenty-two, and we hid the truth from each other like we were made for it."

GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,25,"I haven’t eaten yet.” “I haven’t, either, but this isn’t a dinner date.” He steps closer so I feel the warmth of his body and smell his skin."

Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,47,I was hoping she missed that.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,5,"Look
for a job."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,9,"For her, it had always been a heart-thumping roller coaster that never ended."

KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,37,Because…holy shit!
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,34,I think it’s a really good idea.

guessed that was how small town girls were raised, and I didn’t like it one
bit."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"I looked at Jack and Heidi, who appeared in no hurry to go anywhere, and I felt the kind of loneliness that can happen in a roomful of people when everyone but you seems to be in on the good time."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,2,"Tomorrow, I had to be functional and easy on the eyes since I had Hamptons frickin’ Magazine coming to do a feature on the café."

Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,13,"Dare I say, this might be one of my favorite nights ever?"
LJ_Shen,The Monster,10,"Becca octopused her arms around Sam possessively, the realization that she stepped into something bigger than her trickling into her system."

Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,11,She was so responsive to his every touch he should’ve known he never could count on having a conversation in the middle of love-making.
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,11,“Of course.” Then Ms. Grant gestured for the children to come closer.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,7,He’d been a loner so long that the condition was probably permanent.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,8,But that clearly wasn’t the case.

Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,10,"“I’m the one who’s been stripped bare.” He yanks the shorts from my grasp and I hear him scurry around, putting them on."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,12,"Granted, he worked hard for that cash and had earned every cent, and he liked having a cushion after years of having nothing."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,9,"“Well, this time that asshole of a prince is taking you out , not locking you up."
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,3,"“Oh, honey, you’d have to be a trillionaire to buy Greece .” “Challenge accepted .” This is what matters."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,28,"The room is steamy, the water is hot, and my glass of champagne is ice cold."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,21,"“Glad I grabbed this dress from my place before we left or else I would have had to miss that really fun time,” I said with dry sarcasm, slinging my jacket on the couch."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,12,"Once out of the car, he led me across the parking lot and straight onto the elevator where he punched in his code."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,12,Luisa: Why didn’t you tell me you were dating Stella??
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,40,"In fact, Bernadette’s breathing seems to calm."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,3,"""That's real nice of you."""
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,33,"Can’t wait to get that sucker up on the wall and spend another year staring at his constipated face.” “That reminds me, honey—have you heard anything about your promotion?” My stomach sinks because I know she’ll freak out when she hears I’m going to be fired."
Sara_Cate,Praise,5,"When you do, you will address me as Sir and nothing else."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,19,"“My parents stole millions of dollars from their company, from people who trusted them, robbing their employees of their retirement funds, and stocks, and 401(k)s so horribly that a company like yours had to take control, lay off hundreds of jobs, and ruin lives."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,7,How could he remind me of someone I didn’t remember?
Sara_Cate,Praise,24,"And at the end of the day, I’d rather be Emerson’s pet than Beau’s girlfriend."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,39,Do you know what’s it like living with you?
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,29,"I’m an expert seamstress, of course ."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,22,She’s special.” I tell him I’m more convinced than ever that she accidentally fell into this thing.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,9,“Why would that bother me?” she asked.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,22,“Bring it.” I storm into the bathroom.
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,1,She couldn't let passion take over — she had a job to do.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,3,"She took her turn at pacing, with short, agitated steps."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,7,"Instead, he shoved his hands into his pockets and rocked back on his heels."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,24,"I plan to not stop, not until we’ve fucked whatever is between us into the open, until my skin fuses with yours and I have invaded your secrets, gleaned your fears, and infused your innermost thoughts with my presence."""
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,33,"“I can’t promise to build you a castle like this, or take you to Paris every year, or even clean up my mouth."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,30,"“Do I look like I give a fuck?” he asks me, before grabbing my other leg and pulling that over his shoulder too."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,16,"This side of Gigi… I frown… It’s innervating, energizing… It’s fucking sexy."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,49,"I went
downstairs, poured a double scotch, and took it over to the couch."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"""Coffee?"""
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,38,"Immediately, she tenses with a gasp."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,12,"Because no matter how much she might like him, or hope to make something real out of this, one thing just wasn’t going to change."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,25,"“I thought you were mad at me,” he mumbles."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,7,"He glanced at me, and it was my time to raise my eyebrow at him."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,32,But I didn’t care.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,22,But today was a day of mourning.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,26,I hear his rented car pull out and drive down the street.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,12,BAD_Ruck (2:44PM): Jesus.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,11,"There was this fire, see ."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,31,"It had been a devastating decision, one I could never take lightly."
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,15,"From the attention, not the cold."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,36,Maybe turn off the broadcast.” I shrugged.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,22,Desire sprinted through my veins and I suddenly felt possessed.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,10,"Driving home, I know it would be wrong to bring anyone into this life."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,7,None of this was real.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,6,"We'd be totally unremarkable, when the theme of our panel is unconventional ."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,11,“What’s that look for?” I ask.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,17,Women flocked to him and other guys liked him.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,17,"Whatever it was, I knew I stood out like a sober guy at a frat party."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,1,"""I won't be more than a minute."""
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,but wasn't quite able.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,5,“Fucking charming.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,51,Dark hair.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,3,"Sitting there getting my dick milked by her, not using anything other than my thumb, if I didn’t think of something else, I might very well be coming with her."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,1,"“Why is that?” “I have plans for us,” he whispers darkly."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,66,"Yes .” He breathes a sigh of relief, as though he genuinely thought there might have been a chance I’d say no, and I can’t help but laugh through my tears."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,22,There’s a desk in the bedroom by the French doors that lead to the balcony.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,12,Brett keeps filming.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,26,“Is someone listening?” I whisper.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,13,Our kisses never end—each one just rolls right into another.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,20,"“But to be honest with you, Axia, up until thirty minutes ago I trusted you with my life."
Sara_Cate,Praise,8,"That’s just for me,” I reply."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,34,harlow.pub/harlots Want a chance to become a Top Fan and win exclusive prizes?
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,16,"I gave him a very large retirement bonus as thanks for his tireless work, and I suggested he visit his daughters for a time."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,3,She sat there for a couple of minutes in shock as the phone continued to beep at her.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,40,The oversized wrench hits the concrete floor with a clatter.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,9,"Finally, we decided on another nude."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,19,"“She might still change her mind,” I tell them, but they all shake their heads."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,34,"“Safe to assume Natya will be there?” “Along with my family, potentially yours if you invite them, and most noteworthy reporters.” “If you’re concerned I won’t be ready—” “I’m not…” How did I say I didn’t want her to be ready?"
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,19,How many times had his parents chosen their selfish desires over him for him to be so blasé about them missing his engagement?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,52,"""Oh?"""
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,21,"I could’ve been doing that this whole time but now that I’ve had you , I don’t think I want anyone else and it sucks because you’re clearly not interested beyond a certain point,” I said, losing my breath."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,37,She thinks it’s a good idea.” My eyes go wide.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,32,"Maybe I should have been more cautious.” He shrugged, as if he had played this over and over again in his head before."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,26,“I always knew you’d settle down eventually.” She shrugged.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,15,"My phone buzzes again, and I see that it’s from Breaker."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,15,"Still, I had fears."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,14,"He moved to the other nipple, this time tugging a little with his teeth as he rubbed my clit harder."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,16,"""No,"" Joe said instantly."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,32,"I reached out and grabbed her, closing my fingers around her arm and pulling her back toward me before the action even registered in my mind."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,11,"“My socks got wet earlier, and I meant to go put on a new pair and forgot.” He got up and grabbed a throw blanket off the back of the longer couch, brought it over and covered my legs with it—not only that but when he sat down again, he lifted my feet onto his lap and rubbed them with one hand while he kept talking."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,17,They would fly back to Tampa tomorrow.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,6,"The shirt he’d casually pulled on, hiding his tattoo."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,16,"I didn’t see Garrett much those years, and now that guilt eats away at me for not realizing there was so much going on with him."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,9,I’m ashamed to admit I actually gasped.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,18,"I grip him tighter instead, pressing my cheek to his chest."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,17,"You just want to fuck with him?” I asked, desperate to keep him on track."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,3,"“You won’t have a chance to even miss me,” he informed her playfully."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,36,Words supposedly couldn’t break you.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,47,“But can I steal him away?
Katy_Evans,Mogul,1,This guy is supernova.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,21,"She’s been waiting for you to step up, I imagine.” “I can’t give her what she wants."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,20,I wonder if Captain will chase after me when he finds out what I’ve done.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,26,“You have no idea how I feel about this.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,5,It was unbelievable and yet completely logical that the first and only time Catalina had said the truth was also the time she confessed to something as appalling as an affair with the man who paid me thirty million dollars annually to make his problems go away—and to never touch his daughter.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,32,Me: I’ll let my boss know ASAP.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,30,"Eventually, her eyes met mine again."
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,10,The line you walk is far too fine.” I laugh.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,10,"Where ?"""
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,21,“Yeah.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,24,"We’re tuning up their closets, it makes sense.” He smiles, glancing at my little dress for a hot second before looking into my eyes."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,13,I already know where his home is but I’ll play along as if I don’t.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,52,"I let my eyes roam over her leisurely, pausing on her hand for a moment."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,5,Leslie needed to be gone by the beginning of next week.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,15,But Maddie knew he wasn't the partying kind.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,10,“Relax a little.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,17,"A few nights later found Simon tossing and turning in his massive bed, unable to sleep."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,8,It wasn’t a statement of abstinence or strong religious views.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,32,“That’s easy.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,27,"His grasp is warm, possessive."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,20,"Still is, as far as I know.” I smirked as I watched her lean over and wrap her fingers around the handlebars."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,Cassie: Stop.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,14,I’m sorry for unloading all of this on you.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,2,"See you soon,” I sighed before hanging up, taking in a deep breath and heading for the door."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,2,"He was so used to people kissing his ass for his power, money, or both—but she was refreshingly abrupt and clearly didn’t give a shit about what he could give her."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,21,So I’m here today to do the best job that I can of making it up to him.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,37,"My father
put her in rehab for six months and we went and visited her once a week."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,10,"A brand you like, I think.” The fucker has the audacity to wink."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,1,Milo burst out laughing and held his hands up in surrender.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,"""No,"" I said instantly, blinking hard."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,25,"“Oh my gosh, Joellen, I didn’t know who that was when he came in."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,52,"Of everything I said, is that the only thing you heard?"""
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,18,"When we reach the apartment, I notice her yawning on her way inside, and I’m surprised to see her walking toward the guest room."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,48,"Weston, darling, please hold on, just a few more minutes, just a— The intruder shoves me forward, I stumble, slip on some of the remnants of the apple pie that are still on the ground."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,43,“I know.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,9,You have what you need.” I’m still gaping at him when he turns to walk out of the garden.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,2,"In sympathy, a couple of tears leak from my own eyes, too ."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,41,But I didn’t feel like sitting.
Sara_Cate,Praise,10,"As I pass the rooms, I take a peek in, but they are still empty, each about the size of a bedroom, and I find myself gulping down my nerves."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,4,"He smiled to himself, thinking his cousins would find his predicament hilarious."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,5,It was hot as Hades in here.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,31,And I was a lucky fucking bastard to be married to her.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,23,But it is; and it’s difficult to put a name to the things he makes me feel.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,13,That quick caress had him nearly groaning aloud at her touch.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,"Gage took off his shoes and lay across the bed with me, both of us fully clothed."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,2,“Just a little catch-up.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,30,How could I be mad at him when I had been doing the exact same thing?
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,11,"And Vane?"""
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,11,That’s what this had to be with Eli.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,8,"Tag was sitting on an armchair, papers spread over a low table in front of him, in a nook with another matching armchair and a couch."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,29,"His nice, round, solid, dependable, highly-lickable shoulder that I can’t bite right now, because I know that tone."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,6,"You are the light of my life.” “Umm…that’s an amazing backstory, Antonio,” I say."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,21,Jaydon unbuttoned his purple jacket.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,32,His message was timestamped from this morning at 3:45 a.m. Pacific.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,3,"Mom never asked either of us about that night, or what had happened, or how we felt about Roger's abrupt departure from our lives."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,16,She shrugged shamelessly.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,30,"Her chest fluttered with excitement, and suddenly the evening became more bearable."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,1,"She did what she wanted, when she wanted, and made no damn apologies to anyone."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,21,She didn’t take care of herself the way she should.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,14,“What else did you notice?” He rested a cool hand on her knee.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,One set of all the residential keys was kept in a room behind the concierge desk.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,51,"She knows how I feel and yet, she still left me."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,48,"If he wasn’t watching me or touching me, then my feelings would stop."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,14,"""Oh, I’m sorry."""
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,23,“Just saw that video of you two.” I glanced at my duffel where I knew my phone was probably receiving texts and calls.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,11,You already did that.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,25,You put me in my place.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,16,Christ.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,2,“You’re threatening to sue me?
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,59,“Where is Raven?” I grit my teeth.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,24,"Because you’re all I can fucking think about no matter where I am or who I’m with, and the thought of you hurt or upset makes me want to raze this city to the ground.” Soft, almost desperate viciousness coated his voice."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,12,Good.” I kissed her once more and went to sleep.
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,16,"He was my friend, no, my brother—as much as it pained me to acknowledge such."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,5,"There wasn’t any reason to hide that piece of information, but for some reason I didn’t feel like sharing."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,47,"“I still remember when you were an innocent twenty-two-year-old, navigating the jungle of New—” “Stop being dramatic."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,25,He bested her ex in every way.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,43,"“I can’t believe I lied to him like that.” “Don’t
give it another thought."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,30,"Perhaps the greatest tell that this time is different is that, when I go for the buttons on Holt’s shirt, for once he doesn’t stop me."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,10,Like less than a twelve-hour move.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,13,She’d been having contractions all morning and nothing the doctor’s did could stop the labor.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,11,Anything else?
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,3,Her sleepy eyes told me she was hazy with lust.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,37,â€œThat was the only reason I didnâ€™t cut her off entirely.â€ I saw Avaâ€™s head jerk up out of the corner of my eye.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,34,“You got paid solely for your workout schedule and not your acting skills with that one.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,9,You gotta hire them pretty to make it worth it.” I rapped once on the desk to get their attention.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,39,Which is probably why he didn’t mark me to begin with.
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,19,Grace bent and put her on the floor.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,18,"I thought maybe we’d add a pool house, too, because we need live-in help.” Max wandered out of the kitchen mid-conversation before I could tell him I was sure we could manage without anyone living in."
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,18,"“Do you mind if I delay your flight for a bit?” The crowd all shook their heads, or offered verbal encouragement."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,24,"By time we
returned the kayak, grabbed our bags from the hotel, and loaded the SUV, it was
nine thirty."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"""No,"" I said, red-faced with frustration."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,26,"Only you.â€ Before I could rein in the out-of-control butterflies in my stomach, someone knocked on the door."
Sara_Cate,Praise,20,"Before I can ask, a woman I don’t recognize walks in through the front door."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,13,“We should all go.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,Hardy touched the shape of my waist and hips through the folds of the white silk gown.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,15,"The more physical evidence I had, the better."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,2,What the hell happened there?
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,1,"I allow my gaze to take in the breadth of his shoulders, that gorgeous neck, the swell of those hard biceps, the smattering of hair on those forearms— No, do not look lower; don’t do it —to the splint that he sports around middle finger of his right hand."
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,23,Kind of like a real-life superhero.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,9,“Told you they were gorgeous.” I cleared my throat.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,7,"He would break her down, or he would die trying."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,43,"The photographers all surround the car as they yell out to me, and the security guards jump in and one begins to drive."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,13,Views from the top of the Empire State Building?
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,9,For.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,18,"I have a speech to make, but I’m feeling crazy."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,3,I liked to fuck women—real women.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,9,She hadn’t had the heart to say no to Patsy though as she hadn’t seen her little sister’s eyes light up with pleasure that intense ever.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,10,"Do you think she knew what normal was?” Kade leaned forward in the chair, his fists clenched."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,5,"“Please consider this
my resignation.” Richard took the envelope and tore it up."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,41,We were in the wide-open sea.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,20,I hung around the boxing gym because I needed to figure out how to shut that shit down.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,4,"“This place is enormous.” He nodded, not adding anything to that."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,7,You’re being a dick.” “And you’re being Little Miss Goody Two Shoes all over again.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,14,"Saving companies… “You’re being quiet,” he said, his voice rumbling in his chest, where her ear rested."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,22,"But you, Hayes, are not a shit."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,22,"Only when I caught her before she hit the floor, did I realize that I had raced to her."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,9,"She’d pouted a little, but had ended up surprising him all over again, touching herself and inviting him to touch himself in response."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,33,I opened my text messages and typed out several drafts.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,17,Breaker: Do you have any plans?
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,31,"“He’s doing pretty well but we have to keep that hip supple.” “Of course,” she said as her heart tripped over itself."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,9,"If you
want."""
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,43,Even his body heat near me made me want to gag.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,19,It was so sweet I couldn’t believe it was real.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,11,"So I’d been that girl, working my way through college and medical school with two jobs, fighting to find the light at the end of the tunnel that would afford me the ability to juggle one life instead of three."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,31,I thought heâ€™d been a decent father during my teenage years.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,8,"My toiletries are arranged in the large bathroom, and all I need is a glass of water for bed."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,21,"“Here,” I tell her."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,23,.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,28,Max barks from his vantage point against Amelie’s breasts.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,40,"What are you doing?” “Hoping
you’ll meet me somewhere."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,11,"As have the rest of my competitors.” The waiter filled our water glasses and I pulled mine toward me, fiddling with the stem."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"""You can't keep me out of here if you can't come up with a good reason for it."""
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,1,"At least there was no wind, and despite the chilling whitewash of furniture, rugs, and modern lighting, it was warm."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,21,"I’m certain that she won’t disown me if it’s you .” In fact, it can’t be anyone other than her."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,29,You’re a pretty girl.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,14,"They should probably scare me, but they make me fall even deeper for him."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,2,Or the elevator.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,1,Frannie 25.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,10,Are you naked in my bedroom right now?
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,33,Natalia laughs and glances at Valentina.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,60,"Somewhere I’d always be safe, where I could go if I ever felt unwanted anywhere else.” “What about the home we built together, Faye?"
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,37,I’m all in.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,5,"I finish chewing, swallow, and then say, “I know I shouldn’t feel comfortable around you."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,21,She’s not a con.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,43,"“And here’s your diner, baby.” “My diner?” “HEAT bought it an hour ago."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,18,“I appreciate the invite.” I raise my glass with a smile.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,38,“Oh.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,33,"“Okay,” I repeated."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,41,"My dick is instantly hard… Okay, harder."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,20,I need to remember that.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,4,“They’re mostly tropicals.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,22,Her heart flipped and a bone-deep ache penetrated her body.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,26,“But it’s ridiculous.” “What did he say?
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,8,He was impossible.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,7,“Neither of us have beef with Da.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,35,“Wow.
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,15,But I always think about that.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,7,Such a good kid.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,4,She’d come in here to review his schedule for next week and probably thought he was ignoring her.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,3,“So?
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,7,"The chef should definitely release these to the public menu ASAP, I think, as we watch the acrobats on stage perform another wild maneuver."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,17,"My eyes are still a little blurry from all the swelling and tears, but there’s definitely a big black truck parked under my porte-cochère."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,26,"Men who’ve thought I was perfectly fine to fuck, but little else."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,30,“Let’s do the damn thing.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,24,I’ve never been more prepared for anything in my life.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,8,The V-necked tan sweater was both casual and appropriate for the office on a Saturday.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,24,Those were my rulesâ€”ones I created after I was old enough to realize emotions had nothing to do with sex and feelings had no place in the bedroom.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,30,You just went for broke.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,10,It’s not even a lie.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,4,You billionaires are a little self-centered at times.” Richard nodded.

Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,29,"Maybe we were both tired of the bullshit, maybe we were escaping into the bubble that was our gated home."

Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,4,"If you can’t handle the position please feel free to walk out now,” he growled."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,17,"The way the shadows hit the sharp lines of his brows, the glare of his eyes, the set of his jawâ€¦these were possibly the best photos Iâ€™d ever taken."

Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,31,They came back clean.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,13,He sits forward and puts his hands on my thighs and spreads my legs.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,7,"That meant Sailor was going to walk away with all that was promised to her, and I with all that was promised to me."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,3,That’s the part that hurts the most.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,13,Apparently alternate universes are real.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,2,. .
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,24,"Some things need to be kept hidden, capisce?"
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,16,"“You may wait in the car for Ms. Forkes.” Everyone scrambled to do his bidding, and the whole front porch, yard, and garden cleared out."
Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,20,Bedsprings squeak overhead .
LJ_Shen,The Villain,18,I scooted to the center of the bed.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,12,"He used that weapon.” “Who used the weapon on you, Maggie?” “Who didn’t?” She lifted a shoulder."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,7,"It was such an explosion of clashing sensations that my stomach clenched and before I knew it, I was shaking, relying on his strong hands to keep me in place as I lurched forward and came."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,29,"But the clothes weren’t entirely their idea—I realized that, looking in the mirror this morning."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,2,And then his eccentric mother wills it all to the tiny dog Vicky cares for.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,11,Don’t like to get my hands dirty.
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,16,"“Come on, let me do your makeup.” I groan at the idea."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,2,"It wasn’t true, but her words were prophecy and that’s all I ever do now."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,41,My shoulders.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,2,"Then I decided, well, since I was good at designing, why not hone it and acquire all the qualifications needed to turn it into a career?"
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,1,"""What a temper you have, little one."""
Katy_Evans,Boss,14,The girl can let loose!” Tim cries.
Sara_Cate,Praise,40,"And while there are a hundred things to say, there is also nothing left to say, no words that will make this situation make sense beyond I want you, I need you, I love you."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,14,"""Don’t ever question me again."""
Katy_Evans,Boss,4,"“Are you impressed by your team at Cupid’s Arrow, Kit?” one of the rowdier men calls out."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,18,"If she were in the forest, she’d blend with the leaves."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,21,"They don’t exactly keep a low profile anymore.” Her voice was light, but her body visibly relaxed."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,35,"I sprint to the bedroom, drag the one suitcase I own out of the closet, toss it onto the bed, then start ripping clothes off hangers and hurling them into the suitcase with no regard for what they are or if anything matches."
Katy_Evans,Boss,9,He’s standing closer than we’ve ever been before.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,4,"Breaker: Watch out, Barabbas is still wetting his pants when you squeeze him too hard."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,3,It’s Ian.
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,20,I’m a grown woman blowing off some steam after a hard day at work.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,8,"“I wish it was your mouth on me,” she told him."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,18,“That’s fine.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,9,"“I’m going to have to close the shop, it just stresses me out,” she finally said."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,8,The hand at his side jerked a bit more.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,5,"Our marriage doesn’t have to be about passion and unrequited love, it can be about friendship and loving your baby girl,” he said to her."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,5,I reached for the salt.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,26,Allowing me to get married and afford a quick getaway after the ceremony with my—hold on there.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,25,Maddie gave her a wry look.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"No questions, no strangers, no police."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,I shot a glance at him.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,4,The audacity of the man.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,31,That flash was a prelude to one of us being slapped across the room.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,22,"Why?” “Well, Grandma Elodie spent a couple years living with us after Wyatt was born."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,8,"William tried to hold himself back, to go slow, but Poppy's knees squeezed around him and urged him on."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,29,"Or, if you’d prefer, I can catch a
plane home and you can handle the rest of this by yourself."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,27,And then I made another idiotic decision by calling a brainstorming meeting with staff to discuss final changes to the resort.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,11,"The love was real, but we were both pretending, hiding.” “What now?” she whispered softly."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,32,"God, there was nothing more beautiful to me than her happiness."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,3,"She almost gasped as she stepped out of the corridor and into a spacious living room with cathedral ceilings and beautiful, tan leather furniture."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,7,"“She’s twenty-nine, long dark hair, well kept and attractive—” “No.” “Her name is Stacey Henderson."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,9,"Well, except for when it came to the love scenes."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,3,Right up until she collapsed in the middle of a shift at the hospital.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,37,Everyone was staring in our direction now.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,14,“It’s an old injury.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,48,"“You don’t know a thing about her, about us."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,2,"Thick, black lashes."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,26,He’d only be ‘explaining’ with a lying tongue.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,7,"“Which makes me Sailor’s slightly unhinged, overprotective brother with a chip on my shoulder."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,15,Instead I take a deep breath and calm my voice.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,41,“No.” He took his time to reply.
Katy_Evans,Mogul,1,My defenses begin to drop once we’re on our way and fantasies of my hot tub return to my mind.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,18,“Okay.” She smiles.
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,16,"""Say,"" Rick said, trapping her against the
buffet, ""how about we go outside."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,14,"“Tell me again,” he demanded."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,29,“I just know it.” The smile he gave her was so full of love that it broke Lauren’s heart.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,1,"He was a little aloof, a little playful, and a little too… Sexy, a little voice whispers."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,7,My nose wrinkles.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,3,I didn’t fucking know she had never gotten married.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,9,"this is a hard— Pinning me with a stare, Huxley says, “Tell me right now something is wrong with your dick or you’re going to San Francisco.” Shit."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,13,Uh oh .
LT_Swan,The Takeover,41,"I see him, the man whom the world sees, the heartless takeover king in the expensive suit."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,5,"“I want to hear you.” “We’re outside,” she told him, panting with each stroke to her hardened nipples."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,30,I hope to see a little more of you now I’m not juggling three jobs.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,19,"I had always thought he looked so sharp, and knowing the intelligence under the persona was even more appealing."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,30,The yelling and tension seemed to have drowned out the sound earlier.
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,30,And then I’m laughing.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,4,"I hope you’re up for the challenge.” “I will admit that acting wildly in love with you is going to be a challenge, but I will do my best,” she said, twirling pasta on her fork."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,24,"Money can buy anything, right?"
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,44,"""Oh,"" I gulp; my core clenches."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,17,"It might not be easy, but if this is our destiny, it’ll work itself out.” The cautious trust I see in her eyes sparks something deep within me."
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,27,"We finish with short nips, light touches."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,5,"At least
something to take his mind off his dick."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,1,. .
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,4,"“Great to meet you.” He let her go, his fingers lingering as he winked."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,3,She was done always playing it safe.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,45,"Mom opens her mouth, but before she can utter a word, I notice Luca flinching from my peripheral vision."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,41,"Early last year, he was told by his doctor he had less than two years to live."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,32,And Nate’s free hand is stroking my foot under water .
LT_Swan,The Stopover,21,“What’s going on?” I whisper.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,3,"Their posture, mild manners, and soft hands robbed them of the authentic masculinity Sam oozed without even trying."
Sara_Cate,Praise,29,"The other part of my week, affected by the workload, is the plan I had for Charlotte."
Sara_Cate,Praise,30,Please don’t fucking cry.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,39,"“You’re home early.” “Slow day at work,” I lied."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,4,“He does not call you that.” Chloe gasped.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,13,"“I’m going to have you, prey."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,33,I sniffled.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,33,When the future I had always imagined crumbles before my very eyes.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,27,"It’s complicated.” “Disentangled?” God, I didn’t know how to explain this."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,42,"And every moment I’m not sleeping, I’m wishing I was."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,18,"When I glance up, I catch the pride in his eyes."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,10,"I was in my room, my door ajar, reading some bullshit textbook."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,11,“You know what’s crazy?” I ask a drowsy Georgia.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,23,“Thank you.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,69,"“If your grandma hadn’t done what she did, I’d never have had an opportunity to find out what you’d do if you were ever put in my father’s position."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,16,I laughed.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,27,"Not that I’m complaining, I love him too."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,28,"“I’ll be good to you, baby,” I reassure her."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,9,"You won’t take anything else, do I make myself clear?” he growled at her, as he backed her into the corner."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,41,"Tilting my face to the side, I admired the natural sheen on the cheekbones I’d inherited from my mother – sky-high and eager to reflect any shred of light in the room."
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,16,"Crossing his arms, Antonio asked, “Tell me what it’s going to take to break this will."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,18,“Is that all you want to say to me?” I narrow my eyes.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,7,"“Guess I’m not the partnering type.” Cassius leans forward, a furrow of concern between his brows."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,27,"â€œWe told you that because we didnâ€™t want to distress you, but Phoebe and I agreed youâ€™re old enough to know the truth now.â€ My pulse thumped in warning."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,17,"Even Emmett has one – don’t make me choose between you or my dog,” Bryce said to more laughter."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,15,She was crying once more by the end of her talking.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,15,This crowd pleaser?
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,7,"Max and I were polar opposites in every way—he was in the classical music track and the rich kid group; I was dirt poor and in theater, and on a full housing scholarship."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,38,"“You’re not serious,” Miranda cried."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,46,"Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon.” I placed my
hand on her arm as we walked back into the room."

GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,15,To the painful beating of my heart.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,3,"Loud sex was one thing, but music and marching practice was another."

LJ_Shen,The Hunter,14,"“Oh, yeah?” There wasn’t a hint of jealousy in his voice, only curious amusement."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,3,"Any time I spent avoiding this call was nothing but a delay in getting out of here, and today was the last day I could afford to spend on piss-scented vacation."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,21,"I cared so little about the expensive designer suit he was wearing, only wanting the birthday suit underneath."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,2,"And while Trey was busy trying to please his new parents and answering all the questions in Bible study sessions, Jahleel and I sneaked around listening to ‘worldly’ music and watching ‘worldly’ music videos with half-naked video vixens."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,19,He widens his stance.

Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,11,"But, sadly, I’m not back in action yet."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,32,If she’ll let me stay in Remy’s life.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,"He helps me into the tub, and I sink into the luxurious warm water."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,49,I was almost disappointed the reason for his betrayal was so pedestrian.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,5,"The halls of the house were eerily silent, to the point that she stopped and turned her phone to vibrate."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,4,“Because that’s going to secure the deal.” I roll my eyes.

LT_Swan,The Stopover,4,“Hey there.” He smiles.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,11,"“Don’t stop.” “A fucking nuclear bomb couldn’t get me to stop.” That glazed look in her eye, her body tightening everywhere, the sheen of sweat that made her body glisten—it all made me want to get her off as many times as she liked."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,1,"“And not a job you hear on a list of what you want to be when you grow up.” “Not so much, but I’ve always been into surveys."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,28,I served her with divorce papers.

LT_Swan,The Takeover,39,It’s big and black and has a new-car smell.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,12,"Ah, damn."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,11,"No matter where they went and what they did, he managed to keep his cool."
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,4,"Yet, I’d overheard my mother asking, heard her agree with my father that maybe it wasn’t such a good idea."

KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,12,"Patrick worked for Wright Construction, too."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,25,"It all feels so far away to me as the room diminishes to a tiny circle, until I’m completely swallowed in darkness."

Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,24,I really needed to get my shit together.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,31,"“I…I didn’t know.” It was an inane thing to say because of course I hadn’t known, or I wouldn’t have asked, but I couldn’t think of a better response."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,5,The asshole hit the ground a second time.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,38,“Nope.

Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,9,"Whoever the bastards were, they had
made it personal."

Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,22,"There are a lot of doors along the two floors, so maybe they’re in there?"
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,3,I open the envelope while he poops next to his favorite light pole with its graffiti-covered base.

Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,33,"It wasn’t long before I discovered that the raw frozen food he gets is more expensive than spun gold, and I can only imagine what it costs to re-up his puffball hairstyle at his monthly standing appointment at the aforementioned dog salon, which has an original Warhol painting of a poodle in the waiting area."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,64,"I’m never letting you go again, no matter how selfish it may be."

Sara_Cate,Praise,26,He pinches my right nipple and I let out a yelp.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,11,I didn’t even think to change the cards.” Especially since she’d change them back in a few months.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,5,"Is that why you kissed me back?” “By handicap, I assume you mean your horrible attitude.” She held his eyes with hers."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,7,"“Walk back,” The Beave says, her voice unconvincing that she believes I can execute walking in heels."

Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,12,"This was Alex, for Peteâ€™s sake."

Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,9,"I hesitated, thrown off-guard by the way he talked to me, friendly and yet insistent, in the way of a man who was not accustomed to being told no."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,31,"“I suppose you’re right.” Her voice was as cold as her eyes, but if I didn’t know better, I’d say it contained the tiniest hint of respect."

GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,25,"He sat forward, propped his elbows on his knees, and pinned me in his gaze."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,17,"Even though her stupid heart had the worst taste in men, she would survive this."
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,27,"It’s not there for pleasure, and I certainly never take women up there—I don’t like to give them the wrong idea, which is that our short-term hookups might not be short-term hookups."
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,9,He was nowhere to be seen.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,14,"Instead of releasing myself from Lottie right away, I keep my arm firmly planted where it is and ask, “Are you going to share that?” “Nope,” she says before taking a huge lick of the Rocky Road ice cream we decided to get together."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,12,Everyone knows that.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,29,"So, use the name you always do when you’re talking to your future husband, or I’ll punish you for that too.” My voice was low, vicious, and held a warning."

Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,32,"Especially with Hayes gasping and groaning softly while I lick and suckle and tease his thick length, sucking him as deep as I can, swirling my tongue around his shaft, and taking him deep again while I play with his testicles and his thighs shake against my arm and hand."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,21,Are you getting married?

LT_Swan,The Stopover,21,He’s on the phone and smoking a cigar as he leans on his black Ferrari.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,37,"He stays there, with me impaled on his shaft."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,9,“Worried something might happen to me and you’ll never find someone to replace me who can deal with you?” I ignore her because she’s probably right.

Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,12,"He lays back and pulls me on top of him again, straddling his waist."

Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,1,"These past few weeks you’ve been from country to country, state to state and every time we’ve tried to get in touch with you…it’s to no avail.” Damn, his addiction to work had caused him to neglect the most significant thing in his life."

Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,35,"But I thought I had dreamed him sitting up in bed again in the middle of the night, the glow of his phone illuminating his silhouette in the dark of the room."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,25,"“Fine?” He watches me, those laser beam hawk’s eyes shining with mirth."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,8,"Gretchen stepped inside, just as he tilted his head back, and she caught sight of his face, which was full of tension."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,3,"That’s why I called this morning because I wanted to make sure you were going to show up for lunch.” “Brian, of course I’d show up.” “I just don’t know, Lia."

Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,18,Hugs.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,13,Death-defying drops.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,16,“You need to do something casual with him.” Drew comes from behind a rack with three dresses over her arm.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,26,“Come on.” She doesn’t have to ask twice.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,36,"How’s everything at the home office?” “Nothing interesting to report since we last spoke, except Denny has launched into some new seasonally themed fart jokes.” “Oh God."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,13,"And because I adore her.” “Even if that’s true, what can she possibly offer you in return?” “Herself."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,5,Caterina knew this was a man who was out of her league.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,19,"“And someday you’ll thank her for it.” Dion looks at me, his gaze pointed."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,34,"I pivot around and he drawls, ""You’re welcome, by the way."""
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,8,It was humbling.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,12,She couldn’t think of a single reason why he’d ask her that.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,30,"“I don’t have a road map, Els."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,30,The spa will have robes for all of us.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,35,He’d been out of my league.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,4,And he knew it.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,19,The start of something new.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,30,“Someone’s here!” “Hello?” a man’s voice calls out.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,6,That was ten years ago and I decided I was going to keep my table-it streak going.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,36,I just want you to have a ring you’ll wear with pride.” He looks at Mr. Laurier then.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,6,He slipped one hand under her pajama top.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,28,“You have nothing to be afraid of.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,36,"She
left to make a life for herself instead of sticking around here ending up like
me.” “Do you even miss her?” I glared at her."
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,25,"“I actually brought some for everybody in case you’re curious to try.” “Oh, totally!"
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,11,"So, so tempting."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,9,And he was definitely not going to cash in on that kiss.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,4,"You already have a key, which means you were already planning to stay here tonight."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,49,"I grunt, press down with my fingers, ""He's gone, Buttercup."""
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,17,I can count the amount of times I have been here on one hand.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,12,With you?” He smiled.
Tia_Louise,Trouble,8,"“Smell your beautiful hair, memorize every inch of your gorgeous body…” His teeth graze my neck, up behind my ear as he inhales deeply."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,7,"Of course, her decision to take a career outside the family business caused fireworks, and he was still disappointed, but that was mild in comparison with Carina’s sweet innocence on the verge of decay."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,16,“I got the sheets I promised.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,51,I shoved him off to crawl toward the entrance.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,25,"Narrowing my eyes, I told him the truth."
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,29,I have no idea what’s going on in there; I can’t hear or see it.
Katy_Evans,Tycoon,9,"You’re being more than generous with your time and patience,” I say."
Emma_Bray,Unmasking the Billionaire,3,"I realize my reasoning is skewed, but that’s how it feels—like if I let another man kiss me I’ll lose the memory of that amazing kiss, that another pair of lips will wipe the memory of his away, and I’m not ready to part with it yet."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,38,“Yeah.” They all keep eating their cereal.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,30,"""I mean…it…tastes like nothing I’ve ever eaten before."""
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,2,"""Be out in a second!"""
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,3,“Not my favorite way to spend an hour.” “I’ll take it!” Trevi volunteered.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"It doesn't matter that you don't have a body."""
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,12,"She swings her feet on the barstool, and then tells me a terrible joke."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,19,“ Were.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,9,“Nice necklace.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,17,"“Oh Sam…you already have.” A lone teardrop fell, landing softly on his face."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,2,So he decided to leave.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,18,"She was very prepared for this, Carter."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,15,"Wanna know how many times that has happened before?” The question sounded rhetorical, but I still asked, “How many?” “Never.” “So, what’s your point?’ Trevillo made an exasperated noise."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,30,"Am I making myself clear?” She looks up at me and nods, her eyes filled with an emotion I can’t quite name."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,His suit jacket and tie were missing and the cuffs of his shirt were loosened.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,6,The only reason we didn’t fire you earlier was because your side job didn’t interfere with your work.” Meredith took another sip of coffee.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,43,I was a little boat who’d lost her moorings and was drifting aimlessly out to sea.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,37,"Apparently, she lived on Long Island now with her husband and her deeply spoiled cat."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,15,"“Christian!” She placed a hand over her chest, her face two shades paler than usual."
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Hero,12,"The college campus
was a dangerous place."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"""Oh."""
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,38,"Did you get robbed?” More likely, he’s moving, but this is the first I’ve heard about it, and an anxious pit grows in my stomach, wondering how I fit into whatever his plans are."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,34,"Piles of folded towels, soap bottles, other bottles of various sizes and colors grace one of the sinks."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,13,"""Oh."""
Rose_Shain,Reverie,21,I laughed.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,33,"Up.â€ They swept through the living room, pilfering the most valuable items and putting their filthy hands all over my family belongings before they finally left and silence fell."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,7,I could have just ignored him and then blocked his number.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,19,"“Here, Legally Blonde.” He tossed the food onto my desk without sparing me a look."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,14,"If you stay with me, I’ll continue to pay your bills as long as you continue to provide companionship . . ."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,22,“Well… there was something.” Then she shakes her head.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,41,"“It’s been eight years, Ben."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,37,I reveled in the pleasure of that small movementâ€”itâ€™d been two weeks; he must be in serious pain by nowâ€”even as my heart tore itself apart at the way Ava looked like at me.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,25,"I could tell it bothered the hell out him
that I kicked him out last night."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,9,But he’s just an asshole .
Emma_Bray,Her Billionaire Stalker,6,"Are there cameras up there too?” When I don't answer, she prompts me again, her voice shrill."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,24,"The place was surprisingly busy for a Monday night, but it always had its regulars."
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,12,"“I ask you,” he says, tilting his head, which adds hot-guy dimension to the smile."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,2,“It’s not just a little bakery .” I couldn't help snapping.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,17,“Out of my way.” I waved him off.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,20,"“You might be aware, but Raven is not.” “I can—” “No,” she cuts me off."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,5,But my phone wouldn’t log on.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,9,"I just don’t want much to do with them,” I groaned."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,21,I don’t know.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,36,"**** Carter I was
sitting at my desk when a call from Sadie came in."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,15,"The sooner I can talk to him, the sooner I can get the hell out of here."
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,13,"She smiled again, but it didn’t last long."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,19,And I saw nothing but blur.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,65,"“You’re saying sorry, but you really don’t sound very sorry at all, Luca.” He chuckles and runs a hand through his hair."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,30,“Yeah.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"""Nick's not worth going to jail for,"" I said."
Laurelin_Paige,Dirty Filthy Billionaire,9,“I can’t trust you.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,13,For Cillian.
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,9,“Fuck’s the matter with you?
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,23,Thank you.” Marshmallow growls harder and stalks Hayes’s ass.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,52,I’ve never wanted anything as much as I want her unconditional love.
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Ex-Wife,3,"The charming lines that always fanned around his eyes when he smiled smoothed immediately. """
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,She throws me a patronizing smirk.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,48,"She continues, ""You’re making too much of all this."""
LT_Swan,The Takeover,40,He leans forward.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,30,What was I to do?
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,30,“He’s everything to me.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,8,"""You don’t get to ask the questions."""
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,3,"“‘Remember, you are the prize she is vying for."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,30,"I do not understand straight women.” “It’s a cup,” I reply."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,7,I jerk my chin up.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,39,"Why is it that I always get these fake smiles, but Sierra and Raven get genuine laughter?"
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,20,"With love, Taylor She didn’t know what hit her the hardest: that he’d ignored all her professional cues and formalities, that he’d mentioned a second date, or that he’d thrown in the “L” word."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,4,"I bolted upright, but I was alone."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,5,He wondered if she’d like them when they were in full bloom .
LJ_Shen,The Villain,20,“How did you know I was here?” I asked.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,3,She was seconds away from seeing her first love and she had a feeling the meeting would be quite the chilling one.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,10,"She squirmed underneath him, so close to her peak, needing him to move."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,8,And she’d fallen into bed and slept for hours.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,30,“Got it.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,35,"I squirm underneath him, wanting him to release my wrists so I can paw his perfect body."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,1,"She’d been absent from work for a week already, and was therefore the cause of Lauren’s sudden craving for Scotch whiskey."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,2,"Maggie’s dislike for him was an asset—she wouldn’t get any romantic, moony ideas when she met his family and pretended to be a part of it."
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,31,"I need to get them out before I
stitch you up."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,10,"“Is there a reason?” “Not that kind of reason,” I assured him."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,7,"“I told you,” she whispered."
LJ_Shen,The Hunter,10,I’d suggested she mind her own business.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,15,"He unwrapped a bar of soap, lathered it between his palms, and began smoothing rhythmic circles over her back with his hands."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,6,I couldn’t muster up the humor for the conversation.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,29,"It could, couldn’t it?"
JS_Scott,The Billionaire’s Obsession _Sam,4,And it was true.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,29,"“Stella.” I placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, rousing her from her stupor."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,39,"He’s had it in his possession since the first night we spent together, unashamedly so."
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Max,10,"“You know, you get less and less like Mr."
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,25,Then I got a better look.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,21,"Why am I still on my hands and knees, on the bloody kitchen table, waiting for him?"
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,9,"Setting aside the book she’d been reading, she greets me with a muted “Hello.” I’m surprised she didn’t speak in Italian, but simply nod in response."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,32,We leave in less than an hour.
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,20,"“Why does she think you’d leave her?” “I got the feeling it was because of the baby thing,” I said, my chest aching again."
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,32,"I didn’t know when it had happened, but I knew that I needed it."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,18,"“Another chance?” Stifling a grin, I thought, I’m so loving this game ."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,28,"When I didn’t say anything, she dropped her hand, looked down at my necklace, and then back up at me."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,5,"For a moment, I thought she was going to ask us if she could take our picture, but she appeared to be texting someone."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,23,Note to self: cracking one’s knuckles is very soothing.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,5,“Need to use the bathroom?” I asked Winnie.
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,29,So I wouldn’t see her here anymore.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,10,Rip looked in the mirror and wondered what Caterina saw in him.
Katy_Evans,Mogul,13,I can’t imagine what being betrayed by the one you love and vowed to spend your whole life with feels like.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,14,"Not only did he admit to being wrong, but in his own way, he admitted that he didn’t want to be without her."
Annika_Martin,The Billionaire's Wake-up-call Girl,16,He couldn’t just leave it alone?
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,13,“Fine by me.” Patrick scooped up the money and tossed it down on the tray.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,14,"He withdrew the sizzling pan from the stovetop, dumping it into the sink and turning on the faucet."
LT_Swan,The Stopover,18,.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,18,Do you have any idea why?
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,12,"“You going to text Harper back?” Scarlett asked, grinning at me."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,16,Jensen and Morgan smiled and shook hands with some of the people in line.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,10,He didn’t want me.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,45,"Christopher
was almost seventeen, and the twins, Chanel and Camille, were blooming
teenagers at the age of thirteen."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,13,"I’m totally
offended by that comment."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,16,Isa had also found a manager for Refurbs for Vets—someone she and Eli had both met with and approved of—so Eli no longer had to handle the day-to-day.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,7,I pause.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,26,"Or expensive things.” “Yeah, well, we’ve already established that your exes were idiots, so let’s make this the last time you compare me to them ever again, alright?” I laughed, eventually making her laugh too."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,10,"He was looking after you.” “Are you kidding me?” I cry, storm into my bathroom, and look around: there’s a basket of dirty washing and tampons are on the cabinet next to the sink."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,9,“You’re so lucky to have them.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,7,"“Happens all the time.” He gripped the steering wheel, half pissed at the truth in those words."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,32,"“Fuck,” he murmurs."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,8,She tried not to think about that.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,13,“I didn’t realize you were such a big soccer fan.” Asher Donovan and Rafael Pessoa both played for Holchester United in the UK.
Diane_Alberts,The Prince's Bride,6,Solid.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,13,"“I never wanted to let you go.” “It’s not easy for me to believe in you,” she said quietly."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,10,Jax slid his arm around Baby's waist.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,24,Why would she think that?
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,4,"“You thought I was a hooker,” she said, her top lip curling."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,10,It didn't sound right.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,4,I’m not.” “Good.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,9,"""It says here, Luke,"" I had reported, ""that you're supposed to be sleeping fifteen to eighteen hours a day."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Secret Babies,6,"He pulls out not just one, but two car seats – rear-facing, designed for children the twins’ age, and tucks one under each arm, carrying them back toward the car."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,"I can tell you anything you want to know about rigs-to-reefs."""
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,9,"“I’m visiting Derek today so we can ride together,” Drew said as he steered her towards his car."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,34,He had finally relented then—turned me around on my arms and knees and thrust into me with such force that the entire bed had jolted.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,7,I snatch up the revolver.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,20,My stomach roared its impatience.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,33,There could be a million Drakes who work in construction.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,10,"The sooner we get this night over with, the better.” “How long do we have to stay?” A muscle ticked in his jaw, and he grabbed the drink off the table."
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,30,"But I think I’m ovulating, and Thatch is like real virile, if you know what I’m sayin’.” She put a distressed hand to her face."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,38,“That maybe it would be a good idea if we .
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,19,"“If they keep butts filling some of our seats, that’s their only value to me."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,3,"Then: “I don’t think Plato had ‘giggling’ in mind when he wrote that.” “Hey,” she said, her nostrils flaring with anger."
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,29,"The nights he wasn’t
with me, he’d go out to the clubs and party."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,15,"Then he appeared in the bedroom doorway, carrying a candle in his hands—and wearing nothing but a black, floor-length cape with the collar turned up."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,3,Ever.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,18,I just wanted more of Winnie.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,33,The older man walks toward her.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,7,“What exactly would you like to touch upon?” Her phrasing lured my eyes down to her tight little body.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,7,"“Jett, can you please …” “Please what?” I moaned, “Please shut up and fuck me here."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,17,The black-metal garage doors rise slowly.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,19,I want him to print every inch of my skin.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"""I'm friendly to all the tenants,"" I said."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,16,See you then.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,15,The woman was seriously overreacting.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,29,He carefully pours us our coffees and passes them over with a side plate of cakes.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,30,"An hour later, fresh from my shower, I wandered back out to the living room, scrolling through my cellphone."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,38,Not that we ever would’ve told Dad or Mom that.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,13,“You’re the rightful heir but you’ve been away almost two years.
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,12,"Usually women make their fascination with my money known right away, and then it’s easy to just end things before someone gets hurt."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,2,"""Or is that even your real name, Mr. Get a Pseudonym?"""
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,14,"“You think that was a real kiss?” I cup her cheeks, cradling them."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,8,"“Come on,” I tell Raven, but she shakes her head."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,24,We’re here for you to sign the paperwork.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,5,"When he tugged her hand free from the fist she’d clenched it in, she allowed him to examine her wound, staring at him in dazed confusion."
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,5,"I’m not Jane Bennet in Pride and Prejudice , swooning at Netherfield for days and days because of catching a cold ."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,3,"His signature cologne—fresh and woodsy—surrounds me first, followed by his tight grip, and then the subtle hint of his lips pressed against my cheek."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,55,"Because this road you and I are walking… if we see this through, there’s no going back."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,35,When she isn’t.
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,15,"""What are you waiting for?"""
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,2,"When they took us, she didn’t stand a chance.” “You knew she was dead.” “Yes."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,24,He and I.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,15,"“Are you ready?” “Yes,” she breathed urgently."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,43,"Something she doesn’t want but can’t get rid of.” “That’s not—you’re not— ugh .” “I get it, Daisy,” Emily says softly."
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,7,He didn't.
LT_Swan,The Stopover,23,"“Claudia was easy.” “Because you didn’t really love her?” I shrug, unable to put a label on my feelings."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,66,"I truly thought we could get through anything together, but eventually, he’ll tire of this battle too."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,2,"""Okay."""
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,48,My guts churn and bile rushes up my throat.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,17,"Her pulse throbbed low, her sex growing slick."
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,7,"“I am taking it seriously.” “This isn’t just a game, Lottie."
Alexa_Riley,His Alone,25,"“If you behave through lunch, I’ll bring you back here and give you what you want."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,25,Hallie shook her head.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,26,"“Rage texting her will get you nowhere.” “You don’t know a damn thing about what gets me somewhere with a woman.” “I know Evie’s quiet, but she’s smart as fuck."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,39,"“Apologies.” Kai released me, his expression strangely self-satisfied."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,28,"“Dion,” she whimpers, her voice breaking."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,4,"""You've already met Mr."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,24,“There’s just a lot going on in the business.
Alexa_Riley,Devotion,9,"I had thought for a second that it wouldn’t have followed me here, but I guess I was wrong."
LT_Swan,The Casanova,18,That’s actually a good idea.
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,66,"“For years, I collected each nice note you wrote me."
Emma_Bray,Stalked by the Billionaire,2,"“Why are you offering me this?”  I ask him warily, taking a step back."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,13,"In order to teach you a lesson, I think I should—” He lunged for me, and I squealed, ducking his reach and racing around the island into the living room."
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,7,I repeated it until she subsided.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,37,"The moment I saw you
in Starbucks, I felt something."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,12,"She missed Michael’s mother’s quiet insistence in the kitchen, the smell of baking, and drinking coffee on the terrace."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,18,She didn’t whine or guilt him.
Sara_Cate,Praise,15,"Growing into something I’ve always wanted, but never felt confident enough to ask for."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Bargain,8,"No Yankees, no Mets."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,2,Michael watched with trepidation as the gleam in her eyes brightened.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,9,“Or coins.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,38,"Slipping a finger under her chin, he tipped her head up."
Emma_Bray,Stalked by the Billionaire,4,I adjust my stiffness on my way up the elevator.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,3,Not that she was trying to impress Reese Crane.
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,19,You froze?
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,20,"""Yeah."""
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,29,We both laugh.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,23,"Hudson, Samuel ."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,45,“Of course.” He leaves us alone.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,1,"Between both of our moans, I
was sure the people next to me could hear, but I didn’t care."

Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,32,"“It’s Paris in spring, mia cara ."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,2,"She thinks we’re mules or something, as evidenced by all this."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,11,"What I ate of it, anyway.” “Hmm.” He sent a gaze down her body and up."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,4,"Didn't want to do anything beyond kissing with them."""
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,2,"For god’s sake, Hayes, call the police , my mother would say."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,7,"“Let’s hope for your sake you’re not dumb enough to turn down my offer, too,” I muttered to an invisible Minka as I took the highway toward Boston."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,1,"I know the way.” Kimber sighed, exhausted."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,59,"They broke through, switched off the electricity, had their best bomb disposal expert dismantle the one around my chest."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,20,“Have fun filming garbage.” “I will.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,38,"Slowly at first, then faster as I got more comfortable with his size and the angle."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,8,He’s a friend.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,11,"A full bouquet of bloodred roses sat on the high table, serving as the centerpiece of the room."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,41,To walk their own path.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,5,"The praise Sadie gave me for being possibly the only woman unaffected by his charms was undeserved, because I was affected by him and, yes, I liked him."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Revenge,3,"He enjoyed the view from the huge windows and his few minutes of peace, before he had to continue his day."
Leslie_North,The Billionaire's Sexy Rival,3,"Poppy let the smile bloom across her face slowly, drawing her painted lips back over what she knew to be a set of immaculate, pristine white teeth."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,61,The sound of her voice slices through the noise in my head.
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,35,"You shouldn’t have.” “I didn’t , my dear.” When I blink at her, she sighs, a great gusting sigh that manages to sound affectionate and disgusted and theatrical all at once."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,23,"The climax rushes up from my toes, screams up my spine, and threatens to explode."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,44,"I glance up, trace his features with my gaze—that patrician hooked nose, those clear eyes, the lush dark hair that flows about his shoulders, that pouty lower lip that I want to suck on."

LT_Swan,The Stopover,5,I really don’t know what kind of meeting has scotch involved.
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,6,"Yeah, if you think this is scandalous, you should have seen the last elevator we were in, I thought as the doors opened again, this time welcoming an older, incredibly boisterous man complaining about something or another."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,1,I slept all of fifteen minutes last night.

Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,3,"""Good."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,23,"We’re going to get you
prepped for surgery as soon as your parents get here.” “But it hurts!” the boy wailed."

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,12,"She just happens to be here, and I’m putting the time with her to good use."""
Alexa_Riley,Everything for Her,32,And I’m wondering if Oz didn’t mention it until now so that I didn’t have enough time to change my mind.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,15,He showered and hopped onto the bus back to the hotel with his teammates.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,43,"“We’ll sneak away again soon,” I promised, though I doubted our sneaking was anywhere near secret or sleuth in any way at this point."
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,19,"I didn’t give a shit what Dex said, I saw how Noah’s eyes lit up."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,7,Somehow.
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,26,"Like, for instance, with our accommodations."

Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,16,He couldn't blame her at all.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,17,"He studied her face before speaking, a completely forlorn expression on his own."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,10,She shooed him away and went in to sit by Trinity’s bedside.
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,2,"It was Prince A-hole, heir to an international bourbon dynasty, devoid of affection for shaving, haircuts, new clothes, or, it appeared, the human race."

Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,21,"Because you’re about to have orders to fill, darlin’."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,18,"You tell me what you want.” She gasps for air, and I let up on my hold only a touch."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,8,“It’s not you.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,37,"But more, I want to stay right here."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,14,No reply from Nelly.
Sandi_Lynn,Jamieson Finn,16,"“Thank
you.” I nodded as I took off my scrub cap and gown and walked out of the room."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,5,I’m saying that I realize how ridiculous this whole thing is.

Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,6,She licked her parched lips and told him the other thought in her head.
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,10,"She wanted to thrust back against him, to drive him deep inside her and to ease the ache that he was teasing her with."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,36,"“Years later, I found out that he ended up marrying the woman his family chose for him in return for his parents accepting him back into the family."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,9,"He pushed forward, leaning in to skim his lips over her buttock, enjoying her quick, noisy intake of breath."
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,7,"“Work, I guess."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,2,"The bar, one of my favorites, felt like a private member’s club from the fifties with its low lighting, Chesterfield sofas and American standards coming from the grand piano in the corner."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,I asked.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,3,"Warmth, heat, the taste of him pours through my veins, fills my senses."
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,34,"Turbulence shakes the plane for a moment or two, and he tears his lips off mine to bury his face in my neck, the way he did when we went to Hawaii."

and helped him stand."

Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,21,It felt like it took hours to get to her.
Sara_Cate,Praise,31,"I want you to let me worship you and…” His voice trails, and my heart hammers in my chest while I wait for him to continue."

KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,5,"“I see,” she said."
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,13,Too many hours had been spent trying to remember how this felt.

Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,8,“Should I find someone else’s lap to sit in?
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,29,She was bold and clearly had enough forearm strength to pull the stick out of Reese’s ass.

L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,45,"""You’re not getting any sympathy from me."""

Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,7,"Decided you weren’t worth the trouble, but here you are."
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,8,It didn’t hate.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,15,"Out of all of our friends, Belle and I were the most unlikely pair and also the closest."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,13,"Then I couldn’t talk anymore, because he was moving inside me too hard and too fast, raveling me up into that tight, high spiral, taking me to the brink where pain and pleasure were nearly indistinguishable, and all I wanted was more."

Pippa_Grant,Mister McHottie,4,He’s moved on.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,5,"I’m not romantically involved with anyone.” I motion to my body and say in the voice of the old lady from Titanic , “It’s been eighty-four years since these breasts have been touched.” He smirks and nods."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,27,"I’d never let anyone hurt you.” He presses my sweat-soaked hair back from my forehead, and I can’t help but ask, “That wouldn’t bother you?"
Rose_Shain,Reverie,29,"So, come home with me.” “I have work to do.” “So do I."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,2,"You're likely to see strip clubs and triple-X stores cozying up to circumspect office buildings and condos, and shade-tree mechanics and shotgun houses sidled against concrete plazas studded with glass skyscrapers."

Katy_Evans,Boss,22,He groans and eases back to look at me.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,24,"I was enjoying every nerve-wracking minute, and I started to just let go and trust."

LT_Swan,The Casanova,2,"It sucks, because he’s a really great guy."
Stella_Rhys,Bad Boss,22,"Also, the mere fact that he was standing near me was apparently good enough reason for Julian to come back, circle an arm around my waist and reclaim me."

GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,26,“They’re for me?

Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,7,6 EMMETT I was working out on the deck when Ozzy leapt from his spot in the sun and bolted straight into the house.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,35,"“Stop.” She caught my gaze, but Wes was already backing away like he knew he’d gone too far."
Tia_Louise,Boss of Me,37,"“Andrea Rebecca Harris.” Her dad’s voice is another sharp command, but it doesn’t deter Drew."
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,"Life without Breaker is a life I don’t think I could handle, nor do I want it."

Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,24,"“I’ve worked up quite an appetite,” he spoke
as he pulled out of me and disposed of the condom in the bathroom."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,I dart to the nearest trash can to dispose of my iced tea lemonade so I can hold the letter without dampening it.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,4,She dares go toe to toe with me?
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,35,"“You are one crazy motherfucker, you know that?” he asked, his lips turned up in a full-on smile."
Jessica_Lemmon,The Bastard Billionaire,7,"“I never suspected you as the chivalrous type, Eli,” she told him, her grin parting bright pink lips."

Sara_Cate,Praise,7,Fuck it.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,21,"Adorable and wondering at my hurry, her teeth dug into the skin of her lip and her head tilted just slightly to the side."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,15,I frowned.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,16,A wave of goosebumps springs up on my skin as his breath caresses my chest.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,6,"""You told him huh?"""
LT_Swan,The Stopover,16,“This is unbelievable.” “You’ll be fine.” Alan laughs as he leans in and starts the car.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,35,“Is it working?” “No.” But my shoulders relaxed and I released her wrists as her laugh wound its way through my chest.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,44,I glance at the mirror and notice the note tucked into a corner of the glass frame.
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,31,THIRTY-TWO K IMBER I feel sick.
Annika_Martin,Most Eligible Billionaire,13,Considering.” I shrug.
Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,5,I nodded as I worked on my third Scotch of the night.
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,18,She didn’t trust anyone else.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,21,Poor deluded woman.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,5,"Her life was upside down, and she didn’t even want to think about having a possible crush on a guy."
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,25,The relation is obscure.” The woman looked between the two and snatched the brunette’s hand from Lovello.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,6,Yes.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,7,"I’m pregnant, she’d said at that time."
Leslie_North,The Billionaires Pregnant Fling,11,"“Tell me,” he whispered ."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,25,“Is it really necessary for me to move in with you?” I ask as Luca parks in front of my apartment.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,33,Tonight would mean another hotel bed and another team dinner.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,15,“Food’s ready.” I took her hand and dropped it gently.
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,20,"Quietly as possible, I undressed, pulled on a T-shirt, and went into the bathroom, pulling the door shut behind me."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,27,It was too selfish.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Lies,25,He was lucky I didn’t blow it up when he was in it.
Catharina_Maura,The Unwanted Marriage,19,"I pause and take a moment to study her, enjoying my position outside of her field of vision."

Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Protector,6,"After that, they didn’t talk, and Anna didn’t believe she could make conversation right now."
Rose_Shain,Reverie,17,I even asked Josie if I could help her get coffees one day.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Christmas Bride,7,"""Because you wanted a place to spend the holiday season, and this is the only space available."""
Annika_Martin,Breaking the Billionaire's Rules,33,“Damn.

Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,26,"That night, we danced under the stars, holding each other the entire time."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,36,"The tinted windows prevented me from seeing inside, but the tense conversation within bled through the door."
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,17,This is.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,45,"It’s been years, yet despite our history , I still can’t tell if any of her tears are real."
GT_Geissinger,Burn for You,30,"I wanted to swirl my bourbon, too, but I’d look ridiculous swirling an empty glass, so I left it on the table."
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,47,Should I just take my wife home right now and bribe the Kennedys?
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,19,"Smooth, unblemished with a golden tan."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,11,"Hi.” “Hi yourself, lass."
LJ_Shen,The Villain,26,For him.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,19,While Trudy is busy seducing the new and straight receptionist on the first floor.” My whole body shook as I bubbled into laughter at the way Lovello sprayed the story faster than an auctioneer at a bidding war.
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,2,I made dinner plans with Andrew and Peter tonight.” “Again?” She cocked her head to one side.

Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,30,Mama’s here now!” I jerk my head up.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,38,He drags his chin down the length of my spine and goosebumps flare on my skin.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,33,Then he chuckled under his breath.
Stella_Rhys,Dirty Deeds,30,"Because in this room, in these arms, I was convinced that this was exactly what love felt like."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,18,"“I still want revenge,” I croaked into his mouth."
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,6,It’s so rare for her to have a night off with her closest ones that I’m more than happy to give her space.

KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,12,"“Mine.” “Oh,” I said as realization dawned on me."
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,20,"“Gentlemen, lady,” I said with a brief acknowledgment to Abigail Tarman, the only woman in the room, “let’s begin.” I settled in for the long haul."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Secret,28,"""You tell that motherfucker to stay away from me and my wife and one more thing—"" ""Wh…what?"""
Ann_Cole,Mr. Mysterious In Black,18,"He wanted to run his tongue all over it, sucking gently on her smooth, soft skin, leaving behind a mark that would identify her as his… The feeling he had as he watched her in his kitchen, in his clothes, wasn’t a feeling he could fathom."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,23,"“They’re not quite ready to seat us.” “Hey, guys,” Castro said, catching up to the group."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,9,She knew she would be considered the most evil person ever if she tried to take Patsy away from the home where she’d made new friends.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,6,.” He shakes his head as if having an epiphany.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,11,No matter how badly he ached to make her cry out his name again… With more than just his fucking knee .
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,I was about to tell her it might take a long time to figure that out.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,14,Together we work our way to the wall where all of the “supplies” are.

Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,11,"I got so crazy turned-on by the idea of buying her virginity, being the first man to take her, make her mine."
Sara_Cate,Praise,33,I see myself changing for him.
Sara_Cate,Praise,4,"This is a cry for attention, which makes sense, considering my attention is exactly what brought her here in the first place."
Melanie_Harlow,Irresistible,30,"Seeing how happy and proud she was must have buoyed his spirits, because he grinned back at her and seemed to walk a little taller, puffing his glitter-covered chest out."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,16,It’s like a bolt of lust zapping right through me.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,3,"After a year and a half of being together, he’s still as handsome as ever."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,10,"Didn’t I do a good job with my lines?” “Yes,” she admitted."

don’t have to show me."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Vacation,11,"“I think it’s perfectly fine furniture and I don’t see why we can’t use it,” she snapped at him."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,16,What would draw a woman like her to him?
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,19,Seriously dreading it.
Sara_Cate,Eyes on Me,19,Is that what I want?
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,16,"""No, I've got a better idea."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,2,They said one thing and did another.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,41,Why?” “I might or might not have planned a surprise party.” “No.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,56,"Sinclair Sterling, with an uncomfortable look on his features."
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,6,Not even sure why I asked that.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,25,"She moves the way I want her to, and I try to keep thinking of her like she’s a toy."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,13,Not a chance.
Rose_Shain,Between Love and Loathing,1,Clara 9.
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,"There was so much I wanted to confide to him...Mama's troubling distance from the baby, and the guilty question of whether I had somehow taken Carrington from her or if I had just stepped in to fill a vacancy."
LJ_Shen,The Monster,15,Mother stood up.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,13,They had nearly fucked each other to death a few hours ago.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,15,I knock on the door.

Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,21,"“Come on, Ruby."
Louise_Bay,Duke of Manhattan,26,"“For me, at least.” “Did she just say she wasn’t interested in things going any further after Grandfather’s death?” “We didn’t even discuss it."

do it."
Emma_Bray,Unmasking the Billionaire,2,“What’s your name?” my voice comes out harsher than I intend it to.
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,13,I’m almost jealous when I watch your face.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,62,"“The next morning, I… I woke up with Hannah in my bed.” I push against his chest, my stomach clenching."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,4,Use logic rather than just have a meltdown.” I tuned into the thump of my footsteps compared to the light patter of hers.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,49,"” I do, but I don’t want him to see where I have to go on the way."
Katy_Evans,Mogul,2,She denied it.
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,18,My purpose.
Max_Monroe,Scoring the Billionaire,4,"She was right, and I was, obviously, a little off my game thanks to months of anticipation."
Tia_Louise,Trouble,36,This kiss is our promise to love and protect each other forever.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,30,"I figured my father had forgotten what he told me a few
weeks ago about creating a position at Calloway Tech for her."
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,32,So no touching.” “Hmm.” He caressed her breast in his palm.

Stella_Rhys,Sweet Spot,15,I didn’t need to be told twice.
Meghan_Quinn,A Long Time Coming,19,"“We know exactly what he’s doing.” “What?” I ask, growing anxious."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,1,I can’t wait to see the coverage in the press!” I shudder.
Ann_Cole,I Choose You,34,"Either that, or was he just realizing he was in love with whoever her was."
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,8,I pinched the bridge of my nose.
Rose_Shain,Between Commitment and Betrayal,12,We can keep doing what we’re doing.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Next Door,19,"He had so much love for his family, he was bursting with it."
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,7,Last chance.
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,11,Very wrong.

Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,6,O’Doul would learn how fricking complicated it could all become.
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Billionaire,4,"It’s a long walk, but it’s a short ride."
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,20,You only told me yesterday that you’re gay!

KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,16,He had always been there for us.
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,3,“Mr.
Ana_Huang,King of Wrath,4,It’s an important matter for our family.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,6,“Yes and no.
Rose_Shain,Reverie,42,"Instead, they’d patted my back and told me I’d done good work and research."
Anne_Melody,The Tycoon's Proposal,9,Chapter Seven Ryan had the opportunity to work on an amazing historical site.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,My smile didn't feel like it was part of my face.
Sarina_Bowen,Hard Hitter,26,What the hell had Vince done?
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,19,I wonder how?
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,10,I’ve got literally nothing left to lose.
Max_Monroe,Tapping The Billionaire,31,"“Ahh,” she moaned, shoving her tit right into the palm of my waiting free hand."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,20,The roses Cam sent me last Monday committed suicide over the weekend and are stinking up my cubicle something fierce.
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,15,“I feel like I want to punch him in the face; does that count?” I asked as Grace rubbed my back.
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,8,"I storm up the steps to the second floor landing, where there’s a buffet laid out with about ten different kinds of hot meals awaiting."
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,3,"""You're right,"" he allowed after a moment."
Lisa_Kleypas,Sugar Daddy,1,That meant I would sometimes be called a wetback even though I was a natural-born American and had never set so much as a toe in the Rio Grande.
Sarina_Bowen,Brooklynaire,13,And we’re kissing again.
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,9,"""Miles has contracted a rare penis shrinking disease?"""
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,26,That was deep.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,17,"But this has nothing to do with work.” “No, nothing like that,” Huxley says."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,44,I don't.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,18,"“Go to bed, sweetie."
Kendra_Little,Billionaire Bad Boy,14,"He should know that Zack didn't believe in love, not
the ever lasting kind."
Louise_Bay,King of Wall Street,12,We were both about to go off to college and maybe we knew we’d be compounding one mistake with another.” It had been the right decision.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,30,I’m so excited to finally meet the little one!” I put on a big smile and pushed the last couple of hours out of my mind.
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,15,"I forgot.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll get lunch one day,â€ I said."
Jessica_Clare,Beauty and the Billionaire,16,I saw a man who expects perfection in himself but is okay with others treating him like dirt.
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,26,"He didn’t care about you, Axia."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,27,This is fucked.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,47,“I love your moans.” I push in a little further and brush my index finger over her lip.
Sandi_Lynn,Chase Calloway,9,"“Come in.” When I looked up, I saw Kinsley walk into my
office with a file folder in her hand."
Laurelin_Paige,Brutal Secret,16,"Like I said, I have a problem."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,5,"This garden was a sacred
place and I knew why she felt so peaceful here."
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Trap,14,A sense of excitement shivered down her spine as she snuck back to her room.
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,17,"“Excuse
me, but who called you to pick up my sister’s body?” “A man
named Mr. Gainsley .” “And
what are you going to do with her body?"
GT_Geissinger,Ache for You,9,Please call me.
KA_Linde,The Wright Brother,35,"He groaned, even before I slipped under the material and took the length of him in my hand."
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,13,“I want to do this together.
Lisa_Kleypas,Blue Eyed Devil,1,"""We'll see what your father has to say about it."""
LJ_Shen,The Villain,26,"I mostly ignored it, but the truth was, I liked keeping my job because I didn’t know if Cillian was going to keep me ."

JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,5,"It takes getting used to after the crazy pace I had before.” “Suicidal, you mean,” he said, his tone edgy."
KA_Linde,The Wright Boss,24,I had made Heidi come here where she needed to play pool and get sloppy drunk to forget.
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,21,"Using his tongue and his very skilled hands, he built her into a raging, crackling flame."
Kendra_Little,Suddenly Sexy,15,"""Give them time."""
Melanie_Harlow,Call Me Crazy,15,My sister’s best friend Anna—she’s an E.R.
KA_Linde,The Wright Mistake,29,But I didn’t want to know.
LJ_Shen,The Monster,13,"I didn’t know why, but I felt this moment was monumental for both of us, though in very different ways."
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,21,I love the way she comes.
Jessica_Lemmon,The Billionaire Bachelor,12,"“Oh, her.” “Yeah, her .” “That’s Reese’s story to tell, Sis.” True, but she didn’t feel like being fair."

Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,32,He was so damn beautiful.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,14,"""Meeting?"""
LJ_Shen,The Monster,25,"I turn around, scrubbing my chin before twisting back to Camilo and swinging a fist at his jaw."

Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,6,She’s right.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,5,“Eight weeks in.
Meghan_Quinn,So Not Meant To Be,5,"Do you understand?” “I’m practically shivering in my shoes.” “JP, I’m being serious."
Kendra_Little,Bedding the Billionaire,13,"She
looked down at her shoes so he couldn't see her face but he could tell by the
way her shoulders shook that she was crying."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,44,Jude leaps into the cockpit and starts the rotors.
Catharina_Maura,The Wrong Bride,15,I’m just telling you the truth.
Sam_Crescent,Billionaire Beast,5,"“I think we’ve come to a
pretty good understanding."
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,23,It's... waaay too iconic.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,46,"The door whispers open behind me, and a shiver runs down my back."
Jessica_Clare,Stranded with a Billionaire,15,"God, had she ever been so drunk in her life?"
Sarina_Bowen,Pipe Dreams,18,Tampa made an unlikely shot on goal.
Diane_Alberts,Beauty and the Boss,2,"She’d been in the city for half a year, fighting her way into this hard-to-attain position at Gale Incorporated, and now she’d been sacked over suspicion of going down on her hot boss—and she hadn’t even done it."
GT_Geissinger,Melt for You,12,"You deserve the raise, I’m sure.” There’s something funny in his voice that gets my hackles up."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,13,Cocktails and small talk?” He nodded.
LJ_Shen,The Villain,6,"Most hung up on me, some laughed, and a handful expressed their regret, but said they’d have to pass on my business."
LT_Swan,The Takeover,28,Is this happening?
JS_Scott,The Billionaire's Obsession_Simon,3,"She gets my share every month.” She reached automatically for a napkin in the center of the island to clean her fingers, the pain of the superficial burn not even registering because she was too shocked by his statement."
Jessica_Clare,The Wrong Billionaire's Bed,13,Anger wouldn’t reach Daphne.
Diane_Alberts,An Accidental Date with a Billionaire,6,He’d made sure his mom never had to worry about money again.
Meghan_Quinn,A Not So Meet Cute,5,interesting.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,15,“Watch the footage of you dancing in the photocopying room from a month or so ago .
Lisa_Kleypas,Smooth Talking Stranger,11,"I think in the right circumstances, you could pull that car out of the driveway any time you want to."""
Catharina_Maura,The Temporary Wife,38,"We’ve spoken in our group chat in the days since Raven’s fashion show, but other than congratulating me, they didn’t say much else."
Sandi_Lynn,Carter Grayson,25,"“I’m
just wondering how you’re doing, that’s all."
Pippa_Grant,Crazy for Loving You,6,“Thank you.
LT_Swan,The Casanova,42,"Stay home, Elliot."
Ann_Cole,Love Has a Name,22,I wasn’t cheating on Tish with anyone.
LT_Swan,The Takeover,29,“Your selflessness with your boys.” I watch him as my heart somersaults in my chest.
L_Steele,The Billionaire's Fake Wife,37,I slap her curved behind and her entire body jerks.
Pippa_Grant,The Last Eligible Billionaire,36,"It was three years before he dated anyone again, and the minute he so much as suspected someone wanted him for anything other than himself, she was out the door."
Ana_Huang,Twisted Love,4,Sheâ€™d changed out of her jeans and T-shirt into a purple dress that swirled around her knees.
Tia_Louise,Make Me Yours,7,“You can change the décor if you’d like.” She goes to the beige-wood corner desk.
Jennifer_Probst,The Marriage Arrangement,10,"She hesitated, not wanting to hurt him, but her gut urged her to continue."
Melanie_Harlow,Tease,19,"“So it’s the distance?” “Yes,” I lied."
Penny_Wylder,The Billionaire’s Virgin,7,"I’m getting that money from him, one way or another."
Louise_Bay,Park Avenue Prince,23,Don’t make a fool of yourself.” She gasped and it was as if someone had their hands around my heart and was squeezing and twisting.
Max_Monroe,Banking the Billionaire,25,Me: Is that an official rule?
Sara_Cate,Highest Bidder,12,Because he knows chamomile helps me sleep.
