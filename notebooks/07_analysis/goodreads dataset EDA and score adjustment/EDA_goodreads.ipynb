On the night Rune\\u2019s life changed forever, blood ran in the streets. Now, in the aftermath of a devastating revolution, witches have been diminished from powerful rulers to outcasts ruthlessly hunted due to their waning magic, and Rune must hide what she is.  Spending her days pretending to be nothing more than a vapid young socialite, Rune spends her nights as the Crimson Moth, a witch vigilante who rescues her kind from being purged. When a rescue goes wrong, she decides to throw the witch hunters off her scent and gain the intel she desperately needs by courting the handsome Gideon Sharpe \\u2013 a notorious and unforgiving witch hunter loyal to the revolution \\u2013 who she can't help but find herself falling for.  Gideon loathes the decadence and superficiality Rune represents, but when he learns the Crimson Moth has been using Rune\\u2019s merchant ships to smuggle renegade witches out of the republic, he inserts himself into her social circles by pretending to court her right back. He soon realizes that beneath her beauty and shallow fa\\u00e7ade, is someone fiercely intelligent and tender who feels like his perfect match. Except, what if she\\u2019s the very villain he\\u2019s been hunting?  Kristen Ciccarelli\\u2019s is the thrilling start to a romantic fantasy duology where the only thing more treacherous than being a witch\\u2026is falling in love.\",\n          \"Yasuko lives a quiet life, working in a Tokyo bento shop, a good mother to her only child.
