Prologue  ALY    I tried to see what others saw in him. I’m sure the height hit them first. Six feet and two inches of pure athletic muscle was bound to grab attention. I got that. I got that the stupid thing he did with his hair made all the girls and even teachers swoon. Of course, I wasn’t convinced he didn’t know exactly what he was doing there. I mean who honestly ran both hands slooowly through their hair in the middle of talking to someone? It was ridiculously sensual – especially when it always left his hair so perfectly tousled, like he’d just rolled out of bed. Then there was his voice. Low and kind of gravelly. The dark hair, light eyes combo – that was a thing too. I got that. But I just couldn’t get past what a prick the kid was. Our dads were best friends, and having grown up with Emmett Hoult, I couldn’t see the appeal that everyone saw. All I could see was what they couldn’t. When the world looked at Emmett, they saw confident, devilish, sexy. I saw cocky, spoiled, arrogant. Your typical all-American jock. I saw the kid I was forced to spend every weekend and vacation of my childhood with – the one that Xeroxed the worst photos he could find in my family albums, just so he could tack them all over my crush’s locker. I saw the kid who got away with literally everything, no matter who I complained to. Teachers, coaches, even the school principal looked at me as a nuisance. A thorn in their side. All they wanted was to adore Emmett Hoult in peace – to be completely charmed by his playful, laid back nature. The last thing they wanted was to have to acknowledge me, the surly buzzkill whose griping would get him undoubtedly pulled from practice, something the football team “just couldn’t afford.” Even my parents defended his every move. “It’s just a sibling rivalry,” Mom would brush it off. “You grew up together. You’re practically family. But give it a few years, Aly, and I’m sure you’ll get on great.” Right. I gave it a few years, and all Emmett did was get worse. In high school, all it took was one evening of his mom comparing his bad friends, bad grades or bad behavior to mine, and I’d wind up paying for it with a week of torture at school. His teammates snickered at me in the halls. He spread the nickname “Baldy” when I botched my haircut sophomore year. By the time I was a junior, I was down to just three friends who didn’t worship him or use me to get close to him, and he told me – “just for shits and giggles” – that he’d hook up with every one of them so I’d have no allies left to gripe to. And he did precisely that. In short, with very little effort involved, Emmett Hoult took over my entire life. At home, Dad raved nonstop about his athletic achievements. At school, he ruled every last hallway and classroom. Even at night, in the privacy of my bedroom, I couldn’t escape the constant texts from friends he’d “mysteriously” ghosted. They sobbed for me to help figure out what went wrong, or begged me to subtly bring them up to Emmett when we saw each other that weekend. They didn’t seem to realize he’d never hang out with them again – that he only hooked up with them to get under my skin. He didn’t even remember most of their names. Simply put, the kid was an asshole. He always got what he wanted, he didn’t have to try, and he never even knew how much his antics made me cry every night. While I was completely miserable, he just carried on with his perfectly charmed life. And so I hated him. For all the many stunts he pulled on me, I despised Emmett Hoult. But amazingly, all that crap happened before the last week of junior year. That was the week he truly ruined my life.            1  ALY    Unbelievable. Of course his ‘summer cottage’ is more like a frickin’ resort, I thought as I walked through the house. I had arrived at Emmett’s East Hampton home a good ten minutes ago, but I wasn’t over it yet. It was going to take awhile to get over this four-bed, six-bath masterpiece of a dream house that Emmett apparently visited just a few weekends per summer. Seriously. This place looked like an ad for Ralph Lauren Home. It had its own wine cellar, pool and outdoor kitchen. It was more beautiful than any home I’d be able to afford in my life, yet it was basically just his side piece home – the bonus one he dropped by if he happened to find himself in the mood. This frickin’ guy. What the heck does his apartment in the city look like if this is what his summerhouse looks like? I wasn’t sure if I wanted to laugh or scowl as I imagined the life Emmett Hoult probably led these days. Over the years, I’d tolerated some Emmett-related updates from my parents, but never enough to get a clear picture of who exactly he was now. Honestly, I didn’t want to know. Because thinking in depth about Emmett Hoult generally led me down a road of jealousy, bitterness and countless what if’s. It made me think of all the bad memories I’d swept under the carpet and tried to tell myself I was fine with when I wasn’t, so I staunchly avoided the topic. That is until now. “Um… Aly?” Evie was unblinking when she finally caught up with me in the guest room, dragging my last suitcase in behind her. Her wide eyes went wider as she drifted inside, stopping in front of the door to fully soak in everything from my canopy bed to the lush, white curtains framing the window overlooking the pool. “So… you said you were crashing at a family friend’s house,” she said slowly, narrowing her big eyes at me. “And I just wanted to inform you that this is not a house. This is a baby mansion.” I wrinkled my nose. “I know. I mean I didn’t know before I walked in here with you, but I had a feeling it would be something ridiculously nice. That’s just… Emmett Hoult. His life is awesome.” “No wonder you hate him,” Evie murmured with fascination as she floated into the bathroom across the hall. The echo of her gasp had me guessing it was pretty big in there. “Aly! Holy fuck, this shower is bigger than my apartment!” I laughed as I crossed the hallway into the bathroom, my eyebrows arching high at the marble luxury that lay within. “Jesus, Emmett,” I muttered under my breath, taking in the absolute spa of a bathroom. “We could actually throw a decent party in here,” I snorted, opening the shower door to peek inside at the ceiling showerhead and waterproof speakers. “Or you could just let me move into your bathroom for the summer,” Evie said as we returned to the bedroom. “I mean Mike might not even notice that I’m gone,” she cracked, though I could tell from the way she winced that she found nothing funny about her own joke. Mike was Evie’s fiancé of ten months and her boyfriend of eight years. They’d been together forever but were, to put it lightly, on the rocks as of late. It was precisely why Evie couldn’t take me in. Aside from the fact that they lived in a tiny studio, and aside from the fact that Mike had firmly said no, their tension these days was already like a third roommate. Trying to make a relationship work was hard enough, so they definitely didn’t need the burden of my homeless ass crashing on their couch. “Well, if you ever do need me to set up pillows and a comforter in that shower, I’m more than happy to,” I offered to make Evie laugh. “I actually could take you up on that. I mean you’re sure he won’t drop by at all this summer, right? Like, not even once?” “Trust me, I triple-checked with his mom when I picked up the keys. She said her friends were just staying at this place because he’s always out of town. He’s at like, some resort for the next three weeks. Then it’s off to his house in Hawaii till the end of summer.” “Jesus, how rich is this guy?” Evie asked, sounding both amazed and disgusted. “And what exactly does he do for a living?” “I actually have no idea,” I mumbled, rereading the texts Emmett’s mom sent me when I double-checked about him being away.   AUNT AUDREY: Yes he will be in the Maldives for the next three weeks! After that he’s got the gala and then it’s Maui till Labor Day! House is all yours. AUNT AUDREY: Please relax and make yourself
 at home – you deserve it after everything you’ve been through!!   She wasn’t kidding. I wasn’t big on pitying myself, but this last week had seriously put me through the wringer, starting with the electrical fire that tore through my Sag Harbor apartment in under thirty minutes. Thankfully, I was at the café when it happened. Not so thankfully, the fire devoured almost all the clothes, books and other belongings I’d acquired over the course of my twenty-eight years – something I’d be way more torn up about if my mind weren’t so completely focused on this particular week of work. It was basically my coming out week for the new and improved Stanton Family Market. Evie and I had poured every last penny of our savings into buying the dead company from Dad, and as a seasonal business in its very first year, I had a lot to prove in just a few months’ time. So the last thing I needed to stress about was where to lay my head at night. I needed a place that I could get quick, cheap and close to work. Hence the summerhouse arrangement. “Alright.” Evie gave one loud clap of her hands. “Let’s stop drooling over this place and start unpacking. We can’t lose focus – we do have a mission tonight.” I nodded dutifully. That we did, because on top of a surprise fire this week, I also had nearly a lifetime of insomnia working against me. I hadn’t slept more than three hours a night for two months now, and while I was generally happy to run on fumes, tomorrow was a different story. Tomorrow, I had to be functional and easy on the eyes since I had Hamptons frickin’ Magazine coming to do a feature on the café. According to Evie, I needed to let them photograph my “pretty lil’ face” in order to personalize our brand. And while I was normally averse to picture taking, I’d do pretty much anything for this venture, so tonight, I needed my beauty rest. And since college, there were only two surefire ways to get my restless body a full and healthy night of sleep. “Dancing and fucking!” Evie declared the moment we finished unpacking the last of my things. “I’m making you do both tonight. You ready, girl?” I snorted as I rolled my empty luggage into the massive walk-in. “Uh, no, because that’s not necessary. It only needs to be one or the other, and I choose dancing.” “Why?” Evie whined. “Wouldn’t you rather play it safe and do both?” “No, because with dancing, I only have to rely on myself. The other option is never a guarantee,” I pointed out. “In case you forgot, I only fall asleep after like… crazy, mind-blowing, lost-two-pounds-in-the-process type sex, and that’s not always easy to find.” “Aly. It’s East Hampton in July. This town is currently a hot bed of A-list actors and pro athletes – you’re basically drowning in sexy, physically fit dick right now,” Evie said. “Also, if there’s anything good about my butthead fiancé at this time, it’s that he works in PR. So it’s legit his job to hunt down the places where all the yummy famous people go.” “Alright.” I laughed as she started digging like a squirrel through her Madewell tote full of dresses for me to borrow. “Well then, if I spot Brad Pitt or George Clooney tonight, I’ll totally go for the one-night stand. But otherwise, we’re just dancing. Alright?” “Brad Pitt or George – what the fuck? Those guys haven’t been hot since two thousand nine,” Evie said with exasperation, tossing a bunch of slinky numbers onto my bed. “And I can guarantee you neither of them have a six-pack anymore, let alone an eight-pack.” “An eight-pack? Does anyone have those outside of Marvel comics?” I asked distractedly, undoing my topknot and shaking out my hair in the mirror. It was just past my shoulders now – long for my standards, and back to blonde for the first time in ages. Three months into this new look, and I still wasn’t used to it yet. But it was finally me – the real me – so thus far, I was loving it. “Yeah, the eight-pack is definitely a rarity,” Evie conceded, tossing me a little black dress to try on. “Like a four-leaf clover. But that’s exactly why if you find one, you have to fuck it.” “I have to fuck the eight-pack?” I snorted as Evie narrowed her eyes at me. “You have to fuck the guy who owns it,” she clarified. “Because he’s clearly physically fit enough to fuck you like a champ. I’m talking pin-you-up-against-the-wall sex, or bang-you-while-you’re-on-top sex.” “I’m sorry – what was that second one?” I grunted as I struggled to wiggle into her skintight dress. “You know. When you’re straddling him but he’s holding your hips and like, slamming up into you? It takes a shit load of core strength to go at it like that for awhile, which is why the eight-pack is essential,” she insisted as I rolled my eyes. “I’m serious, Aly. You know you want that Superman sex. Especially since you lost your good vibrator to the fire.” “Ugh. Don’t remind me.” “I know, it’s a tragedy,” Evie lamented. “But that just means you deserve a good lay tonight. Get some good dancing in, have dirty, wild sex with some stud, then pass out on this five thousand dollar mattress here. No way in hell you don’t get at least six hours of sleep after all that.” I smirked, partially convinced. “Fine. If I find a guy with an eight-pack tonight, I’ll go home with him.” “Atta girl!” “But he also has to be phenomenally good-looking with a decent personality,” I said as Evie groaned. “Oh, please – who cares about personality? It’s a one-night stand. You’ll never see him again!” “Yeah, well, I need to trust him enough to go home with him, ‘cause there is no way in hell I’m having sex with some guy in Emmett’s house.” I shuddered. “That’s just… gross. And way too weird.” “Fair enough,” Evie declared, sliding my shoebox across the floor at me. “Now hurry up and put on these fuck-me heels. We got eight-packs to hunt for, and time’s a wastin’.”            2  ALY    “Hold up – what are you wearing under that dress?” Evie’s question came only once we hit the dance floor at Godsend, the absolute jungle of a nightclub she’d brought me to. Hanging from the ceiling and snaking up the walls were vines upon vines of beautiful flowers and plants, their petals illuminated by the black lights. At first I liked the lights. Then I realized they lit the white of my bra on fire and made it shine like two blazing suns under my black dress. I was legitimately blinding people on the dance floor. One guy actually passed me, yelped and shielded his eyes like he’d stared at the eclipse. Beyond that, I was getting taunted left and right. “Hey! Hush!” Evie scolded two girls who shimmied past me and yelled, “Nice bra!” “It’s okay, I deserve it!” I yelled over the music, still dancing as I stared down at myself. For God’s sake, there were polka dots on the bra. Pink ones. They were so bright they were distracting even me. “Do you not own a black bra?” Evie shouted over the blaring EDM. “Do you not recall the fire that ate everything I’ve ever owned?” I countered. “Shit, right!” Evie cursed, still grooving as she tossed her honey locks over her shoulder. Peering around the floor, she looked back at me and laughed. “Alright, girl, we’ve got way too much weird attention right now. You gotta lose the bra.” “Really?” I crinkled my nose. I had far too much boobage to dance comfortably without a bra, but Evie was right – I also had way too many guys staring at me with grins that ranged from leering amusement to flat-out creepiness. “It’s okay, the dress is tight enough to keep the girls contained!” Evie yelled, reading my mind. “Now go, go, go!” “Alright, alright, I’ll be back!” I shouted before heading off to the bathroom. The first one I located had a line spilling out the door, but thanks to a shot girl who took pity on my radioactive chest, I managed to find my way to an empty employee bathroom on the second floor. In the last stall, I peeled Evie’s skintight dress down to my waist, unclasping my bra and laughing at myself as I whipped it off. It had been on clearance at Victoria’s Secret, and for good reason – it was ridiculously over-the-top girly. Even its polka dots had polka dots. But that was precisely why I bought it. Once upon a time, for all the wrong reasons, I was that stone-faced tomboy who wouldn’t cry and scoffed at all things pink. I went as far as to wear undersized sports bras to minimize my curves because I felt the urgent need to hide all shreds of femininity. Like it was something to be ashamed of. I was stupid then. So these days, I was making up for all the years I forced myself to be what somebody else wanted. These days, I no longer hid my body. I no longer scoffed at “girly” fashion. Gone were the sports bras, oversized button-ups and shapeless loafers. Replacing them were things I’d always liked but never let myself wear – all the shift dresses, pencil skirts, ballet flats and espadrilles. And occasionally, the neon polka dot bras. I snorted at myself as I exited the stall, swinging my bra on my wrist and rather enjoying the feeling of going braless in public for the first time in my adult life. Gathering my hair to the side, I gazed down my front, giving myself permission to admire my heeled feet, my smooth legs and the poor, braless boobs that I’d hidden from the world since the summer they came. Poor girls. It’s your time to finally shine tonight, I decided with a giggle, reaching under my neckline to give my cleavage a boost. But just as I scooped and lifted, I heard a groan. “Fuck – what are you doing?” “Omigod!” I yelped in shock, clasping my hand to my chest as my eyes shot up to see whom the voice belonged to. Holyshitholyshitholyshit. My mouth fell open when my eyes landed promptly on muscle – hard, naked muscle on a tall, dark, shirtless God of a man. Whoa. Okay. What… the fuck? My eyes fluttered. Who was this guy? Where were his clothes? How was this level of hotness even possible? In two seconds I already had so many questions, but
 none of them made it out of my mouth because it was too busy watering over his body. Holy pecs, Batman. I swallowed hard as my gaze traveled across the stranger’s shoulders down to his broad chest and killer six… no. Wait. My shameless eyes narrowed as they counted every deep-cut section of his eeeight-paaaack! In my head, I yelled it like Oprah. But seriously. Shit. He had a fucking eight-pack. Oh, Evie. Part of me wanted to whip out my phone, take a picture and send it right to her, but I found myself quickly distracted by those insane rib muscles. What the hell were they called? I had no idea, but this guy had them and they made him look stronger than a wild fucking animal. My thighs squirmed against each other as I heard his low voice speak to me again. “Yeah, you, uh…” I looked up to see him wince and rub his square jaw in a way I found painfully sexy. “You gotta stop doing that,” he said with a short laugh. I blinked. “Doing what?” He nodded at my chest with a slight crease in his brow. “Fondling yourself in front of me.” My eyes fluttered down my front, and only then did I realize my hand had still been under my dress when I clasped my heart in shock. My cheeks lit aflame as I processed the fact that I’d basically just groped my boobs for a good three to four seconds in front of this absurdly hot stranger. “Oh… my God,” I whispered under my breath, fairly mortified as I released myself and slipped my hand out from under my dress. “I mean if you want to keep doing that, by all means,” Eight-Pack smirked, his lean biceps twitching as he hooked his thumbs in his pockets. “It’s just I already stained my shirt tonight.” He nodded toward his booze-splattered button-up in the sink. “Didn’t really feel like busting the zipper on my favorite jeans.” I took a moment to process what he was saying. I gave a dry laugh as I stared at him. “Was that a boner joke?” “Yeah, but I don’t know how much it counts as a joke when I’m actually hard right now.” “Oh my God.” “What?” he laughed. “Cut me some slack, I thought I was alone in here – I definitely didn’t expect a fucking gorgeous blonde to walk out playing with her own tits.” He held both hands up when I shot a look. “Breasts. Sorry.” “Huh.” I crossed my arms, unsure if the noise I made in response was a laugh or a scoff. I honestly couldn’t tell if I was offended, charmed or completely turned on by this guy, but I was leaning towards all of the above. “Yeah, well… I also didn’t expect to walk out of the bathroom to find a guy just standing there without a shirt on,” I countered. “Pretty sure this is a women’s bathroom.” “It’s a unisex employee’s bathroom,” he corrected, his gaze traveling leisurely up my legs. “And I’m pretty sure you’re not an employee.” “How do you know that for sure?” I challenged. “Because I would’ve remembered you,” he replied as his eyes landed back on me. Ugh, fine. I had been biting it back till this point, but fuck it, I finally let go of my grin. I was officially charmed, my heart skipping a beat as I watched the stranger’s lake blue eyes fall gently onto my mouth. When he looked back up at me, a curious frown pinched his brow. “What’s your name?” he asked. “Evie,” I lied. “Evie,” he repeated. His stare was still glued on me as my own trailed down the vein snaking from his tricep to his thick forearm. I imagined that vein twitching as he did everything from open jars to roll up sleeves to lift giant weights at the gym. I also might’ve pictured those forearms flexing as he lifted girls by the backs of their thighs and pinned them up against the wall, but that fantasy was fleeting. And by fleeting, I mean I forced it out of my head because if my panties got any wetter, they might very well slide off my body. “Hey.” There was a laugh in his voice. “Still with me?” My eyes fluttered up at his question, and only then did I realize he’d been talking to me during the entirety of my ogling. “Sorry – what?” I asked hastily. “Nothing, I was just asking what finally brought you to this club tonight,” he chuckled. “Nothing urgent – just your shitty, run-of-the-mill small talk to hide the fact that I can’t stop staring at you.” Oh. I raked my little grin between my teeth as our eyes gleamed like fucking stars at each other. God, what was happening? I’d known this guy all of twelve seconds yet the sexual tension was through the roof. I could practically hear the spark of electricity between us. It was nothing I’d ever felt before. Then again, he is shirtless and beautiful, I reasoned with myself. And his first glance at you did involve extreme boob grabbing, so of course you’re both thinking about sex. Dirty… sweaty… bite-his-shoulder, claw-his-back kind of sex. All things considered, totally expected – but for the love of God, change the topic already. My mind raced as I rewound the conversation back to his mundane question about what had brought me to the club tonight. “I have insomnia,” I blurted, watching Eight Pack lift an eyebrow. “And dancing is one of two things that gets me thoroughly tired.” He tilted his head to the side. “Come again?” I blushed at myself. “Sorry. Going back to your question about what brought me here tonight… I have insomnia and a fairly important thing at work tomorrow morning that involves getting my picture taken, so basically, I need sleep and I’m pretty much here tonight so I can tire myself out,” I explained, waiting for that sexy laugh – for him to tease or ridicule me. But he gave no reaction. Instead, he studied me, letting silence fill the room for several seconds before flashing a smirk. “I could tire you out,” he said. The huskiness of his voice went straight to my clit. Easy, I pleaded with my imagination. I really didn’t need more mental pictures of what this guy looked like naked and pinning me down on his bed. Any more squirming or blushing and he’d know that he had me tempted, and I couldn’t have that. I couldn’t just hook up with some random guy at a club. Despite how unbelievably hot he was, and how unbelievably hot he’d gotten me in about three seconds, it just wasn’t a thing that I did. “Sorry.” A wry smile twisted my lips. “But I think I have to decline.” “Of course you have to,” he grinned. “Whether you want to is the question.” “In that case, I plead the fifth.” “Why not just take what you want?” he laughed. “I do it all the time, and let me tell you, it’s a great way to live.” I snorted. “I just don’t go home with strangers.” He glanced to the side. “Fine. Then I’ll tire you out over the sink.” Fuck. I couldn’t help glancing over at the sink as well. One tiny look and I was already imagining his hard chest pressed against my back and his big hands filling themselves with my tits, squeezing them relentlessly till I cried out. I could practically hear his gravelly voice growling dirty, sexy filth in my ear as he gripped my hips and pumped into me from behind. Yeah, he’s definitely huge, I decided, not even realizing that I’d closed my eyes till his voice made them flutter open again. “Now that’s just fucked up,” he said, serious despite a curt laugh. Tipping his chin up, he drew a hand across his perfect jaw, his face a mixture of annoyance and arousal as he looked down his perfect nose at me. I swallowed. “What is?” “You making that lusty little ‘fuck me’ face right now.” I breathed out a laugh. “Was I?” “I don’t know. Your cheeks got nice and pink and you were sucking on your lip like it was candy. Is that the face you make when you want to get fucked?” he asked, his question flooding me with heat. “No.” I lied. “I just do that sometimes.” “Well, don’t do it now,” he muttered. “Not unless you want me to pull that little skirt up your thighs and make you come all over my mouth.” Holy… Shit. I was speechless as he smirked. “You’re doing it again.” “What? The fuck-me face?” I choked breathlessly, my entire body on fire. “Sorry. Can’t really help it when you’re standing there without a shirt on and telling me you’re going to lick my pussy till I come.” “Christ.” His jaw tightened as a low growl rumbled from his chest. “Did I say those exact words?” he asked, arousal thick in his voice. “No,” I sputtered hotly, suddenly embarrassed that I’d dropped the word “pussy” right in front of a stranger. “But you implied. So I deduced.” “Right,” he grinned as his eyebrows pulled tight. “Are we fighting, by the way? Because if we are, it’s getting me even harder than I was when you first walked out squeezing the hell out of those perfect tits.” He laughed as my jaw dropped. “What? You can say pussy but I can’t say tits?” “Now you’re just trying to rile me up.” “No, you’ve been riled up. You’re just trying to pretend otherwise because you don’t want to believe that some stranger at a club is actually tempting you to break whatever rule you have about one-night stands.” I glared at his self-satisfied smirk, letting the silence stretch between us till it felt almost deafening. He broke it with a laugh. “I meant to ask, by the way – what was the other thing?” he asked. “What?” “You said that dancing was one of two things that got you actually tired. What was the other thing?” Fuck, I cursed, our stares locked tight as I sucked on my bottom lip. Sex is the other thing, I answered silently as he gave that low chuckle. Crazy, sweaty, eight-pack sex. You asshole. I wasn’t sure how, but he already knew the damned answer, so rather than say it I simply swallowed the knot in my throat. Holding my hair off the blazing hot back of my neck, I tried to reconcile the fact that I was about to do something crazy. “I can have my driver outside in a minute if you want to get out of here,” he murmured, his eyes gleaming at me. I was still chewing my lip, and it took a good few moments to find my words. But when I did, they came out without the slightest tremor. “Fine. Call your driver now.”            3     “Fuck, you’re going to kill me.”
 He groaned against my lips as I straddled him in the backseat of the car, my skirt riding all the way up my thighs. I swallowed a moan as his tongue trailed down to my neck, his cock hot and hard under my soaked panties. He grunted as he tormented himself, gripping handfuls of my naked ass under my skirt, moving my body for me and rubbing my pussy up and down his impressive shaft. “I need to feel my cock inside you already,” he hissed, squeezing my ass so hard I let out a loud moan that surprised us both. “Shit,” I gasped as his cock twitched under me. “Don’t do that,” I whispered desperately. “What – this?” His grin was wicked as he squeezed my ass again and groaned. “You keep making that sexy fucking face every time I do it. How am I supposed to stop?” “You just have to.” “Why?” “Because every time you squeeze my ass, you spread my pussy and it feels too good, so you have to stop.” He stared at me, as if needing time to process the words that had just come out of my mouth. Then with a harsh “fuck” under his breath, he squeezed my ass again – harder this time, refusing to let go. “Am I spreading that tight little pussy right now?” he growled, studying the hot arousal flushing my cheeks as I nodded. He soaked in my expression, his eyes electric as he studied every twitch and tremble of my lips. “Christ. I don’t know what the fuck is happening but everything you do gets me hard. Every fucking thing you say,” he muttered, kneading rough handfuls of my ass. “I swear, I’ve never seen anyone as sexy as you in my life.” “Shut up.” “Don’t tell me to shut up,” he grinned, cupping the back of my neck as his other hand slid two fingers into my pussy. I gasped hard, digging my nails into his shoulders as he pushed himself all the way in. His lips were slightly parted as he gazed down at his own hand under my skirt, watching intently as he pumped gently inside me. He was completely transfixed, and I was in such ecstasy I couldn’t think. I could barely breathe. Everything about the moment was so incredibly hot that I was pretty certain I could come right there and then. “Look at you,” he muttered, his voice hoarse as he pressed his palm against my clit and watched my face contort with pleasure. “Look how fucking gorgeous you are.” He shook his head. “So fucking tight.” He kissed my neck. “And wet. Do you feel how turned on you are for me?” “Yes,” I breathed, closing my eyes as I grinded on his hand for several hot seconds. But with an anguished moan, I forced myself to stop. “But we still have to wait,” I whispered, listening to his groan as I slid gently off his hand. “For the sake of the poor man driving this car, we are not having sex till we get to your house,” I panted. “In fact.” My breaths were fast and shallow as I placed his hands on my waist, holding them there. “You’re not allowed to touch me anywhere but here till we get to your place.” His Adam’s apple bobbed. “Am I allowed to kiss you?” he asked. I thought about it. “Yes,” I decided. He smirked. “I can live with that,” he murmured, leaning forward to suck on my nipple through my dress. Holy shit. My eyelids grew instantly heavy, and I tipped my head back as he swirled his tongue over me, licking and nipping me through the jersey fabric stretched thin over my breasts. It stuck to my skin as he wet it with his tongue, his grip on my waist growing tighter and tighter as his erection swelled even harder underneath me. “You’re breaking the rule,” I giggled as he let go of my waist to peel my dress slowly down my chest. His blue eyes peered wickedly up at me. “Just a little,” he said, letting go of a low groan when he stripped my breasts fully bare. “Jesus Christ.” His eyes were glued to them, soaking them in with pure, unbridled awe. “I swear to God, you’re perfect,” he muttered, his hands flat on my back as he leaned in to lick up the curve of my breast, bouncing its weight with his tongue. Oh my God. I let out a soft moan as he circled his strong arms around my body, wrapping his smooth lips tight around my nipple and sucking greedily, as if I were his last meal. Holy shit. Did I know this could feel so good all over? I didn’t want him to stop. Ever. Lucky for me, he didn’t. He sucked relentlessly on the tips of my breasts, filling the backseat with the wet smacking of his tongue on my skin. A full three minutes went by without him coming up for air, but just as I felt a thrilling tingle rush from my tits to my pussy, he slowed his pace on me, using just the tip of his tongue to lick around the edges of my tight, ridiculously sensitive peaks. “No…” I moaned, my nerve endings on fire as he teased me. “More.” “You said only kissing,” he murmured, wicked amusement in his voice as he brought his hand up to cup my other breast. He squeezed it hard but tugged gently on my nipple, sending a sharp bolt of pleasure between my thighs. “Oh my God,” I breathed in shock as a low vibration flooded my body. “I think…” Was this even possible? “I think you’re going to make me come.” A smirk glinted in his eye as he peered up at me. “I know.” Fuck. My mouth fell wide open as I felt myself closing in on a sensation I’d never felt before in my life. But just as my body started to shudder, I felt the car slow to a stop, and from the corner of my eye, I caught the sight of something familiar outside. Turning, I looked out the window. I blinked when my gaze landed on the pair of white Converses I only now remembered dropping on my way into the house this morning. Wait… What the fuck? “I… did I tell you where I lived?” I whispered my question, dazed and disoriented, but still soaking wet. He released my nipple from his mouth with a pop, lazily kissing up my neck as he squeezed two handfuls of breasts. “No,” he murmured, nipping under my jaw as he pushed my tits together. “Why?” “Because this is where I live,” I answered, my eyes unblinking as my swirling thoughts started to settle. “At least for this summer.” He looked up at me, letting out a laugh despite his visible confusion. “Strange, because this is my house. I bought it three years ago.” My stomach twisted into a vicious knot as I made the connection just a second before he did. Fuck. Me. Heat shot up to my cheeks as I stared down at this man – at his hands still holding my naked breasts. A beat of silence passed as he blinked at me. But then his jaw dropped and he snatched his hands clean off my body. “Fuck – Aly!” he exhaled sharply, his eyes on fire as they stared at me in total shock. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move. Sitting there with his cock still throbbing under my pussy and my tits still wet from his tongue, I felt the world come crashing furiously down on me. Aly, what the fuck have you done? For God’s sake, it was him. I’d just gone home with Emmett fucking Hoult.            4  EMMETT    Sundays usually saw me waking up around noon but by seven this morning, I’d already worked out, had breakfast, walked Ozzy and talked on the phone with Drew. I hadn’t slept at all last night. Not a fucking wink. It was virtually impossible after what happened with Aly. Aly fucking Stanton. For Christ’s sake, I’d known that girl since the day she was born. She used to wear boy’s clothes and chop her hair right up to her ears. I used to make fun of her for being a little shrimp, and she used to retaliate by ratting me out for everything under the sun. Cutting class, throwing parties – the amount of time I spent grounded or in detention thanks to her was impossible to count. Basically, she was the good kid, I was the bad one, and from the first day we met to the last day we spoke, she hated my guts. So what the fuck was last night? And how the fuck was that her? Seriously. She looked nothing like she did the last time I saw her. Her hair was long now, back to her natural blonde. Her waist curved into hips I never thought would fit on her tiny frame, and Christ almighty those big tits of hers had put me in a goddamned trance. Top that with how tight her pussy felt around my fingers and how sweet her nipples tasted in my mouth and I was a fucking madman. My dick had basically been in a permanent state of torture since last night, and the fact that Aly kicked me out of the car before speeding off to God knows where did me no favors at all. I needed to see her. I needed to talk to her. I couldn’t stop thinking about her and I couldn’t sit remotely still. So as I did anytime I was having some kind of problem, I called my brother. Of course I should’ve known before we met for brunch that he’d have no sympathy for my situation. “You said you weren’t going to be in the Hamptons even once this summer despite owning a house here?” Julian snorted. “I guess we can say this is karma for lying to Mom.” “Maybe if I wasn’t completely joking when I said it. I didn’t think she’d believe that I’d be gone the whole damned summer. Have I ever been away that long?” “No, but why did you say it in the first place?” “Knee-jerk reaction? She literally emailed me a list of her friends’ daughters who were visiting either the Hamptons or the city this summer.” “I take it she wanted you to ‘show them around?’” Julian smirked, guessing Mom’s exact phrasing since she’d used it on him many times before too. “Yes, and you know by ‘show them around,’ she means entertain the idea of making one of them my future wife. And here I thought she’d relax on the marriage and grandkids thing once you got married to Sara,” I muttered as I stared uselessly at the menu. I had been trying to read it since we got in, but I wasn’t processing a single word. My brain wasn’t good for shit this morning except for thinking about Aly. “Well, I think my shotgun wedding left something to be desired for Mom,” Julian said distractedly, skimming what I assumed was a work email on his phone. “Yeah, about that. That was a dick move on your part.” “Forgive me. I didn’t feel like waiting to call Sara my
 wife.” “God, you’re soft these days,” I said as I finally gave up on the menu and tossed the damned thing aside. Julian peered up at me. “Why are you throwing things?” “I can’t read that.” “Well, if anyone could manage to graduate college illiterate, it would be you.” I shot him a look. “I mean I can’t concentrate, asshole. All I can think about is Aly, and I have no idea how the hell you expect me to wait all day to see her.” “She runs a business, Emmett,” Julian said firmly, ordering my usual for me when the waitress passed by. “She already hates you too, so if you want any chance of convincing her to stay for the summer, the last thing you should do is bring your drama to her place of work. Besides, you clearly need the time to cool off from… whatever the hell it was that happened between you two last night.” I closed my eyes and breathed out hard. “Yeah, you’re not wrong about that,” I muttered. For the sake of keeping my dick down in public, I’d been forcing myself not to think about what Aly and I did last night in the car. But now that Julian mentioned it, the memories were back in full force. I groaned into my fist as I remembered what she said about how good it felt when I spread her pussy. “Fuck,” I hissed, making Julian clear his throat. “Yeah, on that note, I’m leaving. I’d prefer not to sit here and watch you get actively hard over Aly Stanton.” “You’re leaving because this is the time every week that you pick up Sara from yoga.” “Also true.” “You know I’d be pissed about losing all my closest friends to marriage, but watching a work-obsessed sociopath like yourself get whipped has been great entertainment for me.” “Fuck off.” I laughed. “And you wonder why I’m stuck hanging out with an asshole like Drew. It’s because you, Lukas – all my closest friends are wifed up now.” “Well, hopefully by some miracle, you’ll be able to join the club soon. In the meantime, I’m out. Your friend has just arrived and I’m not interested in being seen with him right now,” Julian said. He straightened his tie as he stood up and with a nod, greeted Drew, who was standing next to our table now with a purposely awkward, close-lipped smile. Julian gave him half a nod. “Mr. Maddox.” “Mr. Hoult.” “I’m going to pretend I never saw you here,” Julian decided, putting on his Persols. “But for the record, I don’t endorse this. I trust you’ll be home in time for your PT appointment tomorrow.” “Yes, sir, you bet your ass,” Drew grinned as Julian then strolled out without another word. I snorted. My friendship with Drew Maddox was probably a conflict of interest considering he pitched for the baseball team my brother owned but like I said, I was running out of friends who didn’t have a wife and a curfew. “How you holding up, buddy?” Drew smirked, snatching a fry off my plate as soon as it hit the table. He took a bite and tossed a wink at the blushing waitress before asking exactly what I expected from him. “So you got pictures of this girl or what? Because I have trouble believing she’s as hot as you say.” I sneered. “In that case, I look forward to you meeting her.” “Well, if she’s even half as good-looking as you claim, I look forward to it too.” “Actually, I just decided that you’re never meeting her. And if you ever try anything on her I’ll make sure you’re on the DL for the rest of the year.” “At which point your brother would kill you. The team needs me.” “Yeah, which is why you’re partying in the Hamptons instead of rehabbing your injury.” “It’s a muscle contusion. It’ll heal by tomorrow,” Drew exaggerated as he shifted down his side of the booth to sit diagonal from me. It was a requirement for us if we ever shared a table. We were both six-foot-three and with our builds factored in, it was generally hard to fit us both in one space. On the bright side, our size tended to result in attention from women. A lot of it. Julian generally found this kind of thing annoying when we were out, but I personally welcomed it with open arms. Apparently at least till today. “The hell was that?” Drew laughed when the hostess left after checking in on us. I blinked. “What?” “She was hot as all fuck and she was basically thrusting her tits in your face.” “Yeah? I don’t remember that happening.” “You wouldn’t. Your eyes were attached to your phone like a fuckin’ high school girl. Who are you texting? Her?” By “her” he meant Aly, but Drew was allergic to remembering names. For the first few weeks that he knew me, he called me Evan. “I got her number from my mom. I was checking if she responded to my text.” “What’d your text say?” “I was asking if I could see her at work. Or if I’d just see her at home.” “Christ.” Drew winced the way he did when he knocked back a particularly large shot of tequila. “Since when did you get this desperate? You’re the one who preaches the whole ignore-them-till-they-come-to-you trick.” “Yeah, that doesn’t really apply to her.” “Why not? And if you say ‘because she’s different,’ I’m going to hurl.” I shot Drew a death look and said nothing at all. “Jesus fuck. So she is different,” he laughed, raising his eyebrows. “Magical tits aside, what’s so special?” I pulled my eyebrows tight. Aside from the fact that I kind of hated listening to Drew talk about Aly, I actually had no idea how the hell to answer his question – because I had no idea how to describe my relationship with Aly Stanton. As far as I was concerned, we had always been a love-hate kind of thing. I definitely fucked with her a lot when we were kids, but that was only because she made it so easy. Since we were little, Aly had made the decision to hate me. I’d say we were around seven years old when she started getting crazy defensive around me and constantly tried to one-up everything I did. When I took up an instrument, she picked the same one. When I started karate, she did the same. When I chose to learn Spanish in middle school, Aly switched out of her French class and into mine – just to prove how much faster she could learn the language. I would’ve found it annoying if I didn’t find it hilarious. Especially since by seventh grade, it was becoming obvious that she was no match for me when it came to athletics or strength. I had her beat in all the ways that people cared about most, and so she pretty openly hated me. But on weekends, we were in a different world. On the weekends, we were basically best friends. Reluctant ones, but still. We were the two youngest, and we were all we had during those long drawn out dinners that our parents insisted on having every Sunday after the game. Julian always abandoned us to hang out with my older cousins so Aly and I wound up stuck trying to entertain ourselves. Usually, that meant watching stupid videos together on YouTube till our parents got too drunk to pay attention to us. Once it got to that point in the night, we’d slip off to sneak vodka from the bar or find weed in my parents’ bedroom. Shit, most of my firsts in life and half of my best memories from childhood involved Aly Stanton. It just so happened that our fight junior year erased any fondness that ever existed between us. In her eyes at least. “I don’t know, man, I’ve just known her my whole life,” I said to finally answer Drew’s question, but by the time I said it, he’d already distracted himself by hitting on the hostess. I rolled my eyes out of habit because he was constantly dipping out of conversations to chat up a girl. But today, it honestly relieved me. I needed time to wrangle my thoughts and figure out what the fuck to do next. I could barely think straight, but there were at least a few things I knew for sure. Aly was back in my life and I was already hooked on her again. I needed to be near her. I wanted to find out everything she did, everything she’d seen – everything I’d missed about her since the day she was gone. After last night, I could barely go two seconds without thinking about her. And since losing her the first time was hard enough, there was no way in hell I was letting it happen again.            5  ALY    Since opening two months ago, I’d come to dread the nonstop chaos that was weekend brunch service. Our menu included our usual items like French toast, crab cake Benedicts and the Stanton Family lobster roll, but on top of that, there were dollar oysters at the raw bar and the ever-popular Hail Mary, which was basically a Bloody Mary on fancy steroids. It was a product of Evie’s food-driven imagination, which meant it was garnished with not just olives and celery but vodka-poached shrimp, pickled asparagus and an obscenely large lobster claw. It was gimmicky, yes, but still delicious and every bit a part of our much-needed rebranding of the company. Drawing the trendy Instagram crowd, no matter how annoying some of them could be, played a huge part in spreading the buzz. So I had to remind myself before every brunch service that the madness was worth it. Of course on this particular Sunday, I was more than happy to drown myself in the crazy. I had my big photo shoot in an hour, but I didn’t even care about running around and getting myself sweaty. I needed the distraction like I needed air to breathe. I needed to think about anything other than the crazy shit that happened to me last night. I needed to forget the fact that I’d not just run into Emmett Hoult but almost had sex with him, and more than anything, I needed to forget every dirty, filthy, annoyingly hot thing he did to my half-naked body in that car, because every time I did, I had to squirm or groan or bite my lip – and anytime I did one of those things, Evie caught me and gave me grief. “You really need to stop being so delighted about this,” I said tartly when she found me taking a mid-shift breather in the kitchen. “How would you feel if you hooked up with basically your high school bully? Huh?” I challenged. “It’s horrifying, Evie. I keep having these moments
 where I can’t breathe. I feel like I’m going to actually die of embarrassment.” “What? Why?” Evie protested. It was hours after I’d told her the story, but there was still excitement dancing in her eyes. “Why be embarrassed about wanting Emmett if he wants you back? Seriously, Aly, what happened between you two last night was hotter than any porn I’ve ever watched in my life, and that’s saying a lot because Mike and I haven’t had sex in three months, and I’ve – ” Evie cut off, swiftly narrowing her eyes at the kitchen guys listening in. “And I’ve been watching a lot of porn, assholes!” she yelled at them, prompting a round of laughter before returning her attention to me. “Honest to God, Aly. This could wind up being an amazing summer of nonstop dirty, sweaty hate-fucking for you. And that could very well be what you need to fall asleep every night. Right? Right?” I squinted at her like she’d grown a second head. “Evie. Have we forgotten that my hatred for Emmett is like, real hatred and not foreplay hatred? You do remember that I despise him, right? Like, truly?” Evie heaved a sigh as she followed me into the office. “Yeah, but can’t we agree that he was a kid when he tortured you like that and he’s probably grown out of that shit?” she pleaded. “It’s not that simple.” “It could be! Half your relationship was comprised of getting each other in trouble with your teachers or your parents, but now that you’re adults, none of that shit exists anymore!” “Yeah, but what about… the thing he did?” I challenged hotly, though my question lost steam halfway through. Evie knew about the big drama that exploded between Emmett and me junior year, but we didn’t really discuss the subject much. That night in college when I got drunk off cheap wine from Trader Joe’s and finally spilled the beans about that fight, I had made Evie promise to say nothing after I finished the story. I just had to get it out. But once I got it out, Evie kind of pursed her lips and winced in a way that made me feel weird. I then broke my rule and asked her to say something, at which point she broke my heart by asking a bunch of questions that made me think she might actually be on Emmett’s side. And since I refused to lose yet another friend to Emmett Hoult, I told her we should just forget the whole story and never speak of it again. That was ten years ago and I decided I was going to keep my table-it streak going. “You know what – don’t answer that question,” I said hastily. “Just…” I sunk into my chair as I groaned up at the ceiling. “Tell me my next move, Evie. He’s been texting me all day about wanting to see me, and I don’t know what to do or say because my brain is completely broken right now.” “Fine.” Evie exhaled hard and chewed her nails for a minute. Then she shut the door, which meant she was getting serious for once. “Aly.” Pulling her chair from her desk, she sat in front of me. “If we’re being real here… financially speaking, you can’t afford anything else. As both your business partner and your closest friend, I can tell you objectively that your best move here is to do anything you can to make things work with Emmett.” Drawing in a huge breath, she let go of a sigh. “Even if it means wasting his hotness and forcing him to be completely platonic.” I looked up at her weakly. “Somehow, I don’t think the platonic thing is going to work after last night.” “Well, it’s either that or move in with me and Mike. Because you can’t afford to rent even a motel room from now till Labor Day, Aly. Even the shittiest one that’s close enough to work is going to cost you well over five grand for the rest of the summer.” I bit down hard on my lip. Goddammit. I wished so desperately I could just move in with Evie and nix Mike from the equation, but that was actually a horrifyingly selfish thought, and it just didn’t work like that. People had lives to live outside of my personal problems – my best friend included. Besides, I could never live with myself if I knew I was the reason they called off their engagement. And I could barely imagine the restaurant surviving if a drama like that went down. If Mike left Evie, we’d both be wrecks. She’d be heartbroken, I’d be guilty, and we’d probably wind up running the business straight into the ground. Which meant I really only had one option. “So basically, I have no choice but to stay with Emmett,” I mumbled. “Yep!” Evie said brightly as I groaned to the ceiling. “Oh, come on, Aly,” she frowned, patting my knee. “It’s going to be fine. I’m sure that you two can coexist platonically under one roof. And if for some reason, you fall out of the shower one day and land on his cock, that won’t be the worst thing in the world, right?” I shot her daggers before swiveling around in my chair and letting my head fall to my desk. God, this was going to suck.            6  EMMETT    I was working out on the deck when Ozzy leapt from his spot in the sun and bolted straight into the house. My heart was already beating fast from my set but now it was racing because I knew his sudden dash inside meant that Aly was home. With the back of my forearm, I wiped the sweat off my brow and trailed Ozzy into the kitchen, my blood rushing faster when I heard the sound of Aly being caught so sweetly off-guard. “Oh my God, hi. Hi! Where’d you come from?” I heard her greeting Ozzy a second before I laid my eyes on her in the foyer. And when I did, I had to hold my breath for a second, because Christ, she was beautiful. My heart damn near stopped as I hung back in the kitchen, happy to let Aly play with Ozzy while I quietly ran my eyes all over her. She was just in her work clothes, but she looked fucking incredible. Her hair was pulled back in a low knot, and she had two locks of blonde hanging down to frame her face. Her tan pencil skirt hugged the living hell out of those hips, and her blue button-down fit just tight enough to trigger memories of exactly how perfect and sexy she was underneath. The fact that she looked this good while laughing with my dog made me want to get down on one knee and propose right there. But then Ozzy gave one short bark to alert her to my presence. “Oh. Hi.” The joy vanished from Aly’s voice the second she spotted me. I tried not to take it personally. “Hey,” I said, doing my best to keep it together as she stood up again. I wanted to touch her. I wanted to put my hands all over her. It felt like every nerve ending in my body was on high alert just waiting to feel her skin on mine. But I could tell from the way she stood stiffly that she wanted none of that. So despite the fucking tornado of need ricocheting in my chest, I wrangled every one of my urges and controlled myself. “Aly…” “Wait, Emmett. Let me start first.” Aly tore her eyes off the sweaty crew neck clinging to my chest. “About last night…” For some reason, I held out for the miracle of her saying she didn’t regret it. “It was a big mistake.” Yeah. Fuck. “What makes you say that?” I asked tersely. Panic flashed in her eyes as I took a step forward. “Wait. Just… stay there for a second,” she said fast. “Because before you say anything else, I just need to say this: I know I’m the one who’s in a bad situation right now, and I’m the one who needs the favor of crashing here, so I’m really in no place to make demands about how you live in your own house. Beggars can’t be choosers, and I know that… but I also know I can’t survive under the same roof as you unless we agree to be strictly platonic and pretend like last night didn’t happen at all. It’s just too weird and irresponsible, and I’d probably move out the second something inappropriate happened again, so I might as well just tell you this now. If you’re for some reason okay with us being friends, I’m going to officially ask you if I can stay here for the summer, because Lord knows I need it. But if you don’t think that’s possible, I’ll pack my bags now and I promise you won’t have to hear from me again. Okay?” She finished so breathlessly she didn’t have the air to stop me when I walked closer to her. All she did was stand there, her eyes wild and flitting all over my face and my chest. “Did you… process all that?” she exhaled anxiously. “Emmett. Please say something.” I struggled to. Unlike last night, she was in flats and standing this close to her made me remember how small she was next to me. It made me fantasize about a million new positions I could fuck her tight, tiny little body in, so the last thing I felt capable of doing right now was telling her that I was fine with being just friends. But I didn’t have a choice. “It’s all good, Aly. We can keep it platonic.” Her eyebrows shot up as my insides screamed what the fuck on repeat. I didn’t believe myself. At all. But I had no other move here. Just hearing Aly talk about her bags was enough to remind me that I wasn’t letting her go again. I’d already told myself at breakfast that I’d do everything in my power to make her stay, and if agreeing to being platonic was one of those things, then I was in – even if I knew every second of it was going to be torture. “Really?” Aly asked, her voice small and her lashes fluttering at me. God, she was so fucking cute. All I wanted was to say no, I want you right now on this fucking floor, but I held back. “Yeah,” I said simply. “Really.” “That won’t… be hard for you?” It’ll be hard as a fuckin’ rock, I thought. But on the outside, I gave a shrug. “Shouldn’t be. I’m pretty famous for having a short memory,” I said, laughing only because it was one of the many asshole things Julian liked to say about me. “Something pisses you off and a second later, you’re fine again. It’s like a magic trick,” he still remarked every so often. And in his defense, that ability was a hundred percent real in high school. Life was easy then, and everything rolled off my back. But by college, the short-term memory became a thing
 of the past. I didn’t have the luxury of forgetting things when I had the weight of the fucking world on my shoulders. That said I liked that people assumed I was still easy breezy Emmett. It made it so that nobody looked past the surface. No one suspected me of having any secrets. They all thought that what they saw was what they got, and that was never anything but an advantage for me. Especially now. “I… wow. I can’t believe you’re being so cool about this,” Aly said, stunned. But she quickly corrected herself. “I mean – I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just… I’m a little surprised. But extremely grateful. Okay. Wow.” She had her hands on her head as she let out a laugh that was a mix between shock and relief. “I can’t even begin to describe how much you’re saving my ass, Emmett. So thank you. A million times, thank you,” she said, looking sheepish when her eyes flickered to my damp T-shirt again. “I would give you a hug but you’re… all sweaty.” I smirked as I watched her. She was still panting as she came down from her shock, and her short little breaths had those big tits straining tight against her shirt like they were ready to pop right out. One look and I was picturing them naked the way I had them last night. In my hands. In my mouth. Fuck. I was already losing it on the inside but I kept a straight face for Aly. “No worries. I’ll take a rain check,” I said. “Ha-ha!” Aly offered a laugh so unnatural I would’ve snorted at her if I weren’t feeling wound so completely tight. I cleared my throat. “Anyway, I should shower now.” “Oh yeah – sorry! Go do your thing!” Aly said eagerly. And before I fucked up our friendship pact on day one, I went upstairs, jumped in the shower and jacked my dick like a fucking animal.            7  ALY    The first few days of living with Emmett went surprisingly well, though mostly because our schedules were absolute opposites. My day started at 5AM so I could get to work by six, since the restaurant opened its doors at seven o’clock sharp. By the time I got home from work, Emmett was usually out or getting ready to leave. From what I understood, summer in the Hamptons meant nonstop fundraisers for fancy folks like him. “These are all the people who write the biggest checks to my foundation, so I can’t flake on their parties without looking like an asshole,” he’d explained the night I came home to find him running late and looking sinfully good. He was wearing a crisp white shirt while knotting a black silk tie, and he looked so fucking handsome that I couldn’t have blurted a faster “no” when he asked me to join him that night. “Aly. It’s all good,” he’d smiled a bit too knowingly when I launched into a nervous ramble about being tired, having nothing to wear, and a bunch of other excuses I was afraid he could see right through – especially since he’d caught me eyeing him through the mirror while he was straightening his tie. But aside from that awkward moment, we were getting along great. What little time Emmett and I did have together at the house was surprisingly good, because so far, it was just a half hour to an hour per day of work stories, Ozzy stories, and showing each other videos on the Apple TV. I mean if there was anything that bonded us as kids, it was the dumb shit we watched on YouTube while enduring our parents’ long weekly dinners. Back then, our preferences involved videos of people falling or suffering horrible bloopers while trying to report the news. These days, however, our taste had matured just slightly to prefer stupid SNL skits and compilations of people being surprised with puppies. I was surprised with how well we were adjusting. It felt so comfortable that I decided to say yes to Emmett’s dinner invitation on Thursday. I mean I had proposed that we’d be friends, and friends did sometimes grab meals together, so I reasoned that this was no different. Though just to be safe, I made sure to wear a ragged old T-shirt and awkwardly long shorts. It was like playing a mind trick on myself. If I didn’t care to look good while out with Emmett, that meant I didn’t see him as anything romantic. Also, if I wasn’t dressed nicely, that meant he couldn’t choose any nice restaurants for us to go to. Right? Well. Not exactly. * * * The restaurant Emmett chose was a beautiful place I’d heard of called Blue Harbor. It was a beachside restaurant designed to look like a cozy albeit super fancy living room. It had a gorgeous open view of the water, and it was high up on the list of Hamptons restaurants I desperately wanted to try, but I wasn’t so sure about it tonight. “It literally says no flip flops or shorts, Emmett, and I’m wearing both,” I said dryly, pointing at the sign on the door and then gesturing down at my legs. I narrowed my eyes at him when he took a longer than necessary look. When his gaze returned to mine, he smirked. “Yeah, I don’t think it’ll be a problem,” he said breezily, walking ahead of me through the doors. “Yeah, except what makes you so sure?” I persisted on the sidewalk. Emmett called back from well inside. “Because I own this place.” I stared. Of course. After inwardly griping about the fact that Emmett secretly owned one of the most heralded restaurants in the same town as my comparatively dinky café, I sucked in a deep breath and dragged my flip-flopped feet in. Inside the restaurant, I found that Emmett hadn’t made it far on his own because he’d apparently been stopped by half the staff and pretty much all the patrons at the bar – men and women alike. I couldn’t help but shake my head as I watched him get treated like royalty in a way I was actually quite familiar with seeing. The girls even used the same line they did twelve years ago – “Emmett, do you remember my name? I bet you don’t remember my name!” Geez. Even as we were seated, I watched with arched eyebrows as the manager glided over with two glasses of champagne, setting them neatly on the table before asking Emmett if he’d like the chef to “just send some things out.” When Emmett nodded, the manager gathered our menus, asked me if I needed anything beyond champagne, and upon hearing my “no, thank you,” gave an elegant nod and then glided away. I mouthed wow as Emmett finally turned back to me. “Guess some things never change,” I noted. “What does that mean?” “All that just now was pretty much what high school looked like from my vantage point,” I said with a laugh. “You walking down the hall, girls fawning over you, and then someone coming up and asking if you have everything you need – usually one of my friends making sure that she did your homework right.” Emmett chuckled. “I still get attention from women, but I can pretty much assure you that everything else about me has changed since high school.” “Really.” I lifted an eyebrow. It sounded to me like a severely bold statement. “That’s kind of hard to believe.” “Why? Everyone changes after high school. I mean look at you. You’ve changed…” He raised his eyebrows. “A lot since high school.” I narrowed my stare as his flicked from my lips to my chest before traveling quickly back up to my eyes. He only grinned when he realized that he’d been caught. “Yes, you’re right. My hair is long and blonde again,” I said so we could pretend that was the part of my body he was referring to just now when he talked about changes. Emmett laughed. “Actually, yeah, that’s a pretty huge change. I’m pretty sure it’s the only reason I didn’t recognize you that night we – ” “Ah, ah.” My cheeks burned as I stopped Emmett from talking about the night we almost had sex for God’s sake. “Oh. Right,” Emmett laughed, swiping his thumb across his bottom lip in a way I wish I didn’t find so attractive. “Change of topic.” “Yes. Let’s go back to how you’ve changed since high school,” I said awkwardly as Emmett smirked. “Fine.” He nodded. “Well, for starters I don’t play football anymore, and that was a pretty big part of my identity back then,” Emmett said. “Plus, I’m way more responsible now since, you know. I have a kid.” I choked on my water. “You do? Oh God, when did that happen?” I asked, wondering how the hell I hadn’t heard about this. Emmett eyed my reaction for a second before giving a slow chuckle. “Yeah… I was talking about Ozzy.” “Oh.” I exhaled hard as he snorted. “But good to know that you’d react to me having a kid with that kind of horror.” “Oh my God, I’m sorry. I just… can’t imagine you being responsible for another human life,” I said, giggling at the mere thought of it. Emmett frowned. “Hey, believe it or not, I’m a good caretaker. And someday, I’m going to be a damned good father.” “Oh – of course you are!” I said, swallowing back the last of my laugh because Emmett looked surprisingly offended. “I mean you’re a good dad to Ozzy, obviously, and you did have pretty much the best possible role model in the dad department,” I added – but the second I did, I felt something twist in my chest. Crap. I froze, blinking down into my lap when I realized that what I felt was a sudden guilt. Because I had known that Emmett’s dad died unexpectedly about ten years ago. It was about a year after our big fight, and I was still at the height of loathing him and indulging in my pissed off teenaged angst, so I didn’t fly home for the funeral. I’d bought the ticket but never showed up at the airport, and since it was still one of my biggest regrets, I’d pushed the memory to the back of my head. Till now. “Emmett…” I started weakly, but he cut me off. “It’s okay, Aly.” I looked up to see Emmett wearing a look so earnest it almost hurt even more. “No… it’s not. You messaged me on Facebook that week, and I didn’t even answer,” I murmured, feeling gut-checked by that memory. It had resurfaced out of nowhere to shame me so hard I shuddered. Fuck. “Emmett, I’m so sorry. Regardless of what happened between us, we were always like family, so that was the worst time I
 could have possibly ignored you.” “It’s fine, Aly. We were kids and we were both in the eye of our own storm,” Emmett said. When I cocked my head at the expression, he smiled sheepishly. “Oh, that was just what my mom said back then. She said however bad I was feeling, it didn’t mean that you didn’t have pain of your own to deal with. Everyone’s got their own lives to live. And honestly, it was better for me to learn that sooner rather than later.” I nodded, overwhelmed by the mix of emotions. Guilt aside, I was amazed that Emmett’s mom had been able to sympathize with me. I was also kind of heartbroken to know that Emmett had even talked to his mom about my absence at the funeral. I had always imagined that he was just happy-go-lucky Emmett, and no problem ever stuck to him for that long. But that clearly wasn’t the case. “Thank you for being so understanding,” I finally said, my voice small. “Like your mom explained, I was just… going through such a hard time because of that whole thing between us and – ” “About that – ” “No.” I looked up at Emmett and shook my head fast. “Let’s not,” I decided. “Right? I mean it’s our first time having dinner together as adults, so shouldn’t we just… try to enjoy our night instead of talking about the past?” I rambled my question. There was a conflicted look on Emmett’s face but I had a feeling he could read the desperation in mine, so after a good three seconds of silence, he nodded. “We can talk about whatever you want to talk about,” he murmured, prompting me to exhale in gratitude. I even managed a laugh because of how ridiculously breathless and flustered I’d gotten. “Easy. Drink some water,” Emmett smirked, handing me my glass. “Thank you,” I snorted, taking a drink and a breath. It probably wasn’t healthy for me to have damn near a panic attack at the mere thought of discussing the past with Emmett, but that was just what it was. Maybe someday, it would change. Maybe. “Breathe, Aly. You good now?” Emmett teased when I finished my water and switched back to my champagne. His blue eyes glimmered as he grinned at me, somehow putting me at ease. But just as I finally caught my breath and found my bearings, a sharp voice rang out behind me. “Oh my God – Seafood Girl? Is that you?” Fuck. Seriously? I winced at the nickname because one, I hated it and two, the only person who addressed me with it was a loud, demanding socialite who I pretty much never enjoyed seeing. Looking over my shoulder, I found myself staring at Britt Heatherton, one of my regulars at Stanton Family Market. She had a notoriously sharp voice and a less-than-favorable reputation among the wait staff. She usually came by for power lunches dressed head-to-toe in Tory Burch, but tonight she was wearing a gorgeous mint green dress that reminded me that I’d come here in faded denim and a T-shirt with my café’s lobster logo on the breast. “Oh my God, so hilarious to see you here of all places,” Britt crowed, leaning in to kiss my cheek. “Are you catering some event? Did you meet my bestie Emmett Hoult? Isn’t he just dee-vine?” she asked, dancing around to his side of the table. My eyes fluttered as Britt ran her hand all over Emmett’s chest, like she was showcasing a prize on a game show. Dammit, Britt, I thought as Britt’s creepy stroking drew my eyes back to Emmett’s body. I had a twelve-minute streak of not looking at it since getting out of the car, but now it was hard for me not to stare at how sinfully good he looked in that white shirt. It was fitted to show off the perfectly tapered V of his torso, and every time he moved his arms, the sleeves hugged his biceps tight. Ugh. Pretty much every inch of Emmett’s body was a breathtaking view, and it made me feel suddenly and shamefully possessive. It made me want to snatch Britt’s hands right off of Emmett’s body and reclaim it as mine. Not that it was mine. I definitely wasn’t supposed to want it to be. I was supposed to be answering some question Britt asked me forever ago, but now I couldn’t even remember what she said. Lucky for me, Emmett cut in. “Actually, Britt, Aly here is one of my oldest friends. She’s the only person I’ve pretty much known since I was born,” he said, prompting Britt’s smile to tighten. “Oh. Is that right? So she’s known you longer than I have?” Britt cocked her head then turned to me with a proud look on her face. “I’ve been BFF with Emmett for like, ten years now. I interned at the events place that did his fraternity’s Black and White ball, and I guess we pretty much hit it off from there, right?” she asked, her bejeweled hand squeezing his shoulder as she beamed down at him. Emmett flashed me a deliberately awkward smile as he answered her. “Yes, Britt. I guess we did.” “Mm-hm. And – oh! Speaking of events, I happen to be planning the party for Emmett’s big fundraiser next month,” Britt told me, glowing with pride. “I’m not even exaggerating when I say it’s going to be the event of the summer, so you should totally come.” Her big smile became half-cringe as she pointed at my shirt. “But definitely don’t wear that. Right?” she giggled, giving Emmett’s shoulder another squeeze. “Don’t worry. Aly’s got some pretty killer dresses in her arsenal.” My heart gave one loud thump as he referenced the dress he’d peeled halfway off my body the other night. But before I could react, Britt cooed again. “Oop! Looks like my date’s here!” she said, holding her tanned arm out to a gorgeous but noticeably sullen redhead who made a show of sulking over in her heels. She rolled her eyes elsewhere as Britt said, “Emmett, you know Natalie.” “Of course. How have you been, Natalie?” Emmett asked, though Natalie refused to make eye contact let alone answer. All she did was whip out her phone and type furiously as we all kind of stared. When she angrily hit send with her thumb, Emmett’s phone dinged on the table, its screen glowing with a new text. The drama. It felt like I was watching a reality show. “Ookay. Maybe go a lil’ subtler next time, babe,” Britt snorted before flashing us her favorite cringe-smile again. “Guess I’ll escort her away. But talk soon, both of you! Have a good evening!” she sang before hustling a glaring Natalie to their table. Once they were gone, I couldn’t help directing a bewildered but thoroughly amused look at Emmett. I knew he sensed it because he was laughing to himself, reluctant to look back at me. “What?” he finally asked. “That was actually going to be my question because what the heck was that?” Emmett played dumb. “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.” “I’m talking about the girl you apparently pissed off so bad she can only yell at you via text,” I snorted. “Something tells me she’s a particularly scorned ex of yours.” “She’s not. I’m not sure you can call any of the women I’ve been with exes.” “Why? You’re still actively sleeping with all of them?” “No. More like I don’t sleep with anyone for long enough to become a boyfriend,” Emmett said. “Well, how long were you with Natalie for?” “I was never with her – we spent a little more than a week hooking up. And I did tell her before we started that I don’t do relationships.” I lifted my eyebrows. “You really don’t?” “You seem surprised.” “Well, the fact that you give official disclaimers before even hooking up with someone is pretty serious,” I snorted. “Plus, you’ve just always been the kind of guy who likes having someone take care of you. That was definitely the case in high school at least.” I could still vividly recall how Emmett jumped from relationship to relationship back then. He definitely had his weeks of being single and hooking up with random hot girls or, to piss me off, my closest friends. But outside those lulls, he was usually elbows-deep in a relationship. He pretty much always had a devoted girlfriend doing things like bringing him lunch, cleaning his locker and recording videos of his football practice to text to his mom. Emmett was notoriously spoiled and pampered, and he loved the perks of having a girlfriend, so I couldn’t help being surprised that he no longer did even the short-term relationship thing. “Yeah, well, I’ve learned how to take care of myself since high school,” Emmett said as our first course of seared scallops arrived. “That’s just a part of being an adult.” “So is learning how to commit to someone, isn’t it?” “I don’t have the time.” “Yeah, what with the grueling nine-to-five you don’t have,” I teased. “I can’t imagine that your mom doesn’t give you a hard time about this.” “She does, but that doesn’t change the fact that I have much more important priorities than being in a relationship.” “Oh yeah? Like what?” “Nothing I feel the need to talk about, Aly,” Emmett said, the sudden steeliness in his tone scaring me out of any follow-up questions. Completely thrown off, I blinked. “Oh. Okay. That’s cool,” I nodded lamely, trying to sound casual despite feeling suddenly embarrassed. I thought we’d been joking around since that was all Emmett ever knew how to do, but apparently, he was more than capable of being serious now. Come on, Aly, I cursed myself, reaching nervously for my champagne when I realized I found Angry Emmett kind of hot. And by kind of, I meant extremely. “Well…” I started, thoroughly flustered now and way too eager to break the silence. “I’m totally with you on the no relationship thing anyway,” I said hastily, swigging my drink. Emmett cocked his eyebrow. “Yeah? And why is that?” “Because like you said, bigger priorities exist,” I said. “I’ve got a restaurant to run, you’ve got… whatever your job is. So fuck relationships. Who needs ‘em? Right?” Maybe I was tipsy, but I actually felt strongly about my words. And I felt even stronger about them when Emmett raised his water glass and agreed. “Yeah. Fuck relationships,” he smirked. “Sex will do in the meantime. Right?” I nearly choked on my champagne but luckily,
 our food arrived on cue and spared me from having to answer the question. And thanks to our waiter’s long descriptions of each special appetizer – as well as how insanely fucking good each dish was – the topic was swiftly forgotten. And for the rest of the night, much to my pleasured surprise, the conversation remained strictly platonic.            8  EMMETT    When Monday came, I canceled plans with Drew and his agent-slash-my business partner, Iain. Plain and simple, I had spent way less time with Aly than I’d expected in my first week of living with her, and I just wanted the chance to be near her tonight. Of course, Drew wasn’t having any of it. “For Christ’s sake, E, she goes to bed at 10PM every night,” he said as I leaned on the kitchen counter. The phone was sandwiched between my shoulder and my ear as I scarfed down today’s post-workout meal of roasted salmon and sweet potatoes. “Are you really going to miss out on Iain’s birthday party that I planned just to spend an hour asking this girl about her day?” Drew demanded. He was on speaker with Iain at Iain’s rental house next to the beach. I did my best to weed out the sounds in the background, but I was still wincing every ten or so seconds thanks to Iain’s girlfriend yelling crazy loud in the background. “Look, if you’re not fucking her, you’re not allowed to stay home for her. That’s just the rule. I don’t care how hot she is,” Drew said. But then he paused. “Wait. Actually that’s not true – I do. Are you ever going to show me a damned picture? Send it now.” “No.” “Then I’ll just have to meet her.” My mouth was full as I laughed. “Yeah, I’m never going to let you go anywhere near – ” “Hey.” I cut off when Aly walked into the kitchen and greeted me with a smile. “Ooh, shit, was that her?” Drew audibly grinned as I walked over to the window, standing at a distance in case Aly could hear his voice on the phone. “No,” I lied as Drew laughed. “Fuck you. Put her on the phone. I need to talk to her.” “Yeah, never,” I said distractedly, watching Aly grab milk from the fridge then open the cupboard to reach for the tray of teabags. I had to suppress my amusement because even on her tiptoes, she was nowhere near reaching the top shelf. And while my instinct was to help, I was also enjoying the hell out of my view. She was wearing her usual outfit at home – a big, boxy T-shirt and black leggings instead of shorts. I had a feeling she went with that because she thought it made me less likely to notice her body, but she was all kinds of wrong on that one. Especially now. She looked so fucking cute reaching up for the shelf. Her arms were outstretched and her back was arched taut in a way that had me staring hard at her ass. God-fuckin’-damn. It was so round and firm I could just imagine the jiggle after I spanked her over my knee. She definitely deserved the punishment for putting me through this torture. “You ignoring me?” Drew went on in my ear. “Iain!” A glass broke in the background. “Iain, talk to this asshole. He’s ignoring me.” Iain got on the phone for a bit but I was barely paying attention to whatever I was saying to him. I was too busy watching Aly’s shirt ride up as she continued to struggle. Fuck me. This was the most adorable torture I’d ever witnessed in my life. The only reason I wasn’t in completely blue-balled hell was because it was also hilarious. When I finally let out a laugh, Aly shot a cute little look over her shoulder. “Are you laughing ‘cause I’m short?” she hissed. I grinned and nodded, muttering some half-hearted response to Iain as I went to grab the tray off the shelf for Aly. I caught the happy little smile on her face when I handed it to her, and I did my best not to get hard over the way she eyed me and mouthed the words thank you. Christ. Add that to the list of accidental cock teases. It was really no wonder that I’d been jacking it like an animal since Sunday. Every little thing Aly did around the house made my dick jump. Whether it was stretching or putting her hair up or just standing near me and reminding me that I was practically four times the size of that tight little body of hers – all of it turned me right the fuck on. I was basically a walking hard-on around her, and it honestly was a miracle that I’d kept my shit together thus far. Hell, I was pretty sure I deserved a medal for it. “Listen, dickhead. If you’re bailing on tonight, I better hear by tomorrow that you closed,” Drew said, breaking me out of my daze. “Either shit or get off the pot, ‘cause this is fucked up. You were supposed to be my wingman tonight. Everyone else here is couples.” “Uh-huh,” I said, finishing the last bite of my meal and putting my plate and fork in the dishwasher. Aly had her back to me as she boiled water, but I caught her eye when she randomly peered over her shoulder. She bit her smile before turning back to her tea. “Hey, so tell me. What’s she wearing right now?” Drew asked just to piss me off. “She wearing a bra or is she – ” “Yeah, cool – have fun,” I talked over him, abruptly hanging up the phone as Aly turned around. She sipped her tea as Drew’s text rang in.   DREW: Just chop your balls off they’re dead weight at this point   Dickhead. I was about to reply but Aly’s question distracted me from the bullshit. “So you going out tonight?” she asked. I exhaled. Her sweet voice was such a contrast to the crap I’d just been dealing with. Instead of replying to Drew, I slid my phone across the counter and shook my head. “Nah. Staying in,” I said, nodding into the living room. “Wanna watch a movie with me?” Aly’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh,” she breathed, lashes fluttering as I looked down into her tea. I smirked. It was cute. She was acting like I’d just asked her out on a date. “Umm.” A little smile wiggled onto her lips. “Sure. I think. I mean I don’t know if I can commit to a whole movie but I can definitely start one.” “Really?” I was incredulous but amused as I went into the living room and turned on the TV. “What kind of person goes into a movie knowing she can’t finish it?” “I don’t know. Your roommate, I guess.” I turned around. I could’ve sworn Aly’s voice sounded sultry just now, and when I looked at her, she had her arms crossed with this sexy little smile on her face. God. I was losing it. Everything she said hit me like she was flirting with me, and it was giving my dick no chance of being anything but hard around her. But with one breath in, I forced myself to get it together. “Well, if that’s what you want to do then pick out a movie and I’ll grab us some snacks,” I said, heading back into the kitchen. Aly laughed. “Uh… you really want to give me the freedom to pick the movie?” “Why not? We always watch the same stuff,” I said. Well. At least we used to. When I got back to the couch, I was surprised to find that Aly had some rom-com on HBO that I’d never heard of before. “Damn. You watch girly stuff now?” I asked as Ozzy trotted over to present Aly his favorite duck toy. “Oh yeah. Fuckin’ love girly stuff now,” Aly said proudly, giggling as she played tug of war with Ozzy. “Rom-coms, reality shows – pretty much everything on Lifetime.” I grinned. “You used to hate that shit with a passion.” “Well, now I love it with a passion. I mean I always did, I just didn’t let myself – never mind. It’s starting.” We shut up to watch and within the first five minutes, I knew this movie was going to be torture. A girl got dumped and then a scene later, she broke her heel on the street and landed on some guy I had a feeling she’d having sex with in about an hour. But I was wrong. They wound up fucking way sooner than that. And for a movie that was pretty fucking lame so far, the sex was surprisingly graphic. “Oh… kay. Well then.” Aly laughed awkwardly when the scene cut straight from kissing outside to the guy shoving the girl onto his bed and burying his face in her cleavage. I chewed back a grin. I swore I could feel Aly’s pulse creeping up next to me as the guy peeled off the girl’s shirt and started tugging at her bra. A part of me assumed they’d cut away, but the camera actually zoomed in when the girl’s naked tits popped out. Aly was dead silent next to me. I couldn’t help peering at her and laughing inwardly at the way she sat stiff as a board, her hands folded in her lap and her eyes unblinking at the screen. She was the definition of uncomfortable. Judging from how tight her throat was, she was holding her breath. I knew she was praying for the scene to end, so I had to smirk to myself when it only got hotter and heavier. It stretched on even after the guy put it in, his face contorting with exaggerated pleasure as he started thrusting. “Unh… ahh… oh, fuck… yeah.” Christ, I felt like I was watching porn. We were quiet as mice as the living room suddenly filled with the sounds of moaning, groaning and grunting. From the corner of my eye, I caught Aly furiously chewing her nail. I knew she was trying to brave through it but the second the guy started jiggling the hell out of the girl’s tits she popped up. “I’m gonna make a new tea.” “Figured you might.” She halted mid-step. “What’s that supposed to mean?” “That you’re awkward about watching a sex scene,” I said. “With me, at least. And that’s fine. I get it.” “Get what? I’m not being awkward,” she denied hotly. “I just wanted a glass of water.” “You just said you were going to make a new tea.” “Well, maybe I wanted both!” “Or maybe you can’t survive watching a girl getting her tits played with like that.” Aly’s cheeks went pink as she glared. “Why would that bother me?” she asked. But before I could answer, she scoffed. “You know what, Emmett? Screw it!” she snapped, plopping back down on the couch. “You can wipe that smug look off your face, because I’m watching.” “Aly, it’s fine,” I laughed. “We can fast-forward if you can’t handle it.” “Can’t handle it? I’m an adult, Emmett, I assure
 you I can handle it,” Aly huffed. Though I knew within seconds that she was regretting it. Then again so was I because suddenly the guy was pushing the girl’s tits up and feeding them into his mouth. There was an extreme close-up as he stuck his tongue out and started licking the girl’s tight pink nipple, forcing me to remember that I’d done the same goddamned thing to Aly just a fucking week ago. Dammit. Suddenly, I was back to thinking of how fucking tight her pussy clenched around my fingers. My dick twitched under my sweats as I thought about that sweet little pussy being wet right now. Two feet from me. All I needed was a quick peek over to confirm that Aly was squirming like crazy in her seat. Fuck. Yeah. She was wet. She had to be. Knowing that, my heartbeat picked up, and despite my outward calm, I felt like a fucking animal. I was picturing myself ripping Aly’s clothes off and palming her pussy to feel how warm and wet she was. I could just imagine her sweet juices running down my palm as I fucked her with my fingers. The stiller I sat, the dirtier my fantasies got. I saw myself kneeling in front of her on this couch. I saw her legs draped over my shoulders, my fist pumping my cock as I swirled my tongue all over and tasted her pussy. I just wanted to hear her moan. I wanted to do everything I could to get those sexy little noises out of her again. I was imagining her big tits draped in my cum when the scene finally cut and she released the breath she was holding. My instinct was to smirk and give her shit, but I was still recovering myself. The tip of my cock was pulsing too hard and it didn’t get better when a scene later, I peered over to see Aly’s nipples were rock-hard under her shirt. For Christ’s sake. She was sitting so still, concentrating so hard on looking normal and unfazed that she didn’t even realize it. It actually made me feel guilty, especially when I peered over a scene later to see those tight peaks still standing up straight under her shirt, just begging to be sucked. Jesus fuck. I was going crazy here. “Oh, that pup looks almost like Ozzy,” Aly cooed during a scene in which some Labrador bounded onscreen. “Yeah,” I said even though the dog looked nothing like Ozzy. Aly was just desperate to say something, anything after our eternity of sex scene silence, and I would’ve called her out for it if I weren’t so fucking busy being a pervert. My cock was throbbing now that I’d snuck so many glances at her tits and imagined my tongue all over them again. Fucking hell, Aly. She was so oblivious – so fucking cute and sexy and completely fucking off-limits that I was actually relieved when a minute later, she checked the time on her phone and said, “I should get to bed.” “Sure. Night,” I said. “Goodnight, Emmett.” And with that, Aly got up and left me alone in the living room, my dick hard and my jaw tight as I wondered how the fuck I was going to survive a whole goddamned summer of this.            9  ALY    “Wow. Someone’s surprisingly eager to get out,” Evie grinned as she watched me fly through closeout on Tuesday. “You finally getting excited to go home to that hottie?” “Uh, no. Not exactly.” I wasn’t so much excited as I was determined to get rid of the weirdness hanging in the air after last night’s movie fiasco. As far as playing it cool went, I’d totally failed and it was embarrassing. While Emmett sat totally unaffected next to me, I’d acted like a complete spaz, and it made me feel the need to normalize things between us. Upon confessing as much to Evie, she laughed. “So what’s your plan of attack to get back in the friend zone?” she asked, running the sales reports as I did final checks on the closing side work. “Honestly, I don’t have one. I just figured hanging around him and having a conversation while acting completely normal would be good enough. I just want to prove to him that I’m fine. That I’m not like, actively wanting him.” “Which you are. But – ooh! You know what you should do? Call him ‘dude’ as much as possible,” Evie suggested excitedly. When I flashed a weird look, her excitement waned to a sigh. “Mike has been calling me that these days and I fucking hate it,” she explained, making me pout. “It just makes me feel so… desexualized. Like he sees me as nothing more than a friend. ‘Cause honestly, has anyone in the history of having sex been like, ‘You have such beautiful breasts, dude,’ or ‘Mmm, dude, you feel amazing inside me?’” “Oh my God, Evie.” I scrunched up my face because I didn’t want to laugh. This was her actual life we were talking about – she just did such a good job of turning it into comedy. It was a defense mechanism. I knew that. But every time I tried to talk to Evie about her relationship with Mike, she asked for us to table it. And since I had my own off-limits conversation topics, I respected her wish. “Alright. Calling him ‘dude.’ Definitely doing that,” I nodded, trailing Evie into the office where she dropped the money into the safe. “Are you heading home now?” I asked, grabbing our purses off their hooks. “Nope. Couple’s therapy.” “Oh. Right. Has that been helping?” I asked hopefully. “Totally. Like, so much,” Evie said, flashing me that tight-lipped, crazy-eyed smile that meant yeah right, fat chance. I sighed and let my shoulders slump. “I’m sorry,” I said, defeated as Evie and I made our way out the restaurant. “And you wonder why I’m dying for you to fuck Emmett,” she snorted as we stood outside to lock up. “My life outside this restaurant sucks. I need to live vicariously through somebody.” “Well, if you want to live vicariously through me and Emmett being just friends, then by all means, because that’s how things are staying all summer. And till the end of time.” “Mm-hm,” Evie said, flashing me that same tight-lipped, crazy-eyed smile as we headed for our cars. * * * There was some action movie blaring on the TV when I got home, so I was surprised to walk in the kitchen and find Emmett reading with intense focus at the counter. He had his laptop out and a backwards cap on his head. That paired with his baseball tee and sweats, and he looked like the quintessential jock I’d known as a teenager. Really, Aly? I cursed myself for finding him so insanely attractive like this. It was like an admission that I’d had a crush on him in high school, and that made me feel all hot and prickly in my cheeks. Good job. Playing it super cool already, I berated myself just as Ozzy looked up from his toy and barked a hello. The second he did, Emmett’s head snapped up. “Hey!” he said, promptly shutting his laptop. I cocked my head slowly. “That was… sketchy,” I laughed, though I was grateful for the moment because somehow, his being caught off-guard had me feeling more relaxed and confident. It made me smirk and pin my narrowed eyes on Emmett as I went to the fridge to grab my bottle of water. Something about the way he leaned on top of his closed laptop was just so incredibly suspicious. “Dude.” I shook my head. “What were you doing?” ‘Dude.’ Nailed it, I commended myself as Emmett cleared his throat. “Nothing. Just work stuff.” “What’s work stuff?” I uncapped my water and leaned across the opposite side of the counter. “I still don’t even know what you do for a living. What exactly is your job?” “I just do stuff here and there,” Emmett answered so vaguely I had to grin, weirdly tantalized by his secretiveness. “Holy shit, Emmett. What do you do for a living?” I pressed. “What are you – a hitman? A male stripper?” He cocked an eyebrow. “You think I could be a male stripper?” He laughed as I blushed. And just like that, he had the upper hand again. “Long story short, I invest in whatever stocks or properties Julian invests in,” Emmett finally said, his answer so normal my shoulders kind of slumped. “Oh.” Nothing sketchy after all. “Good move though. Julian’s always been a genius, hasn’t he?” “Pretty much. And now he owns the Empires. I’m sure you heard.” “Uh, yeah, my dad basically flipped out the day that happened,” I snorted as I remembered the day. My dad rarely called but he called me that day to literally scream into the phone that Julian Hoult – “Emmett’s older brother, and the same Julian you grew up going to Empires games with every Sunday” – had just bought “the whole goddamned team.” It was pretty big news in my family, and I was obviously excited, but I remembered feeling a deep dread as well. Dad’s fixation with the entire Hoult family had finally waned over the years, but I knew that Julian’s purchase of our favorite baseball team would pretty much serve as new fuel for Dad’s Hoult-obsessed fire. Which it did. “Yeah, I can probably imagine your dad’s reaction,” Emmett chuckled with a wary glance at me. Clearing his throat, he changed the subject. “What about you though? How’s your spin-off going?” “My spin-off?” “Your restaurant. I figured you opened it to drive business back to the warehouse,” Emmett said. I cocked an eyebrow. “Yes. That’s… exactly why I opened it, actually. Thank you for getting that. My parents were so upset that I didn’t just dunk all my money into sprucing up the warehouse.” Before I opened up Stanton Family Market, there was just Stanton Family Seafood. It was one of the city’s prominent seafood wholesalers since my grandfather founded the company in 1941, and since I was a kid, its headquarters was a big, un-glamorous, viciously salty-smelling warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn. When my grandfather passed, my dad inherited the business, and for awhile, he continued selling seafood like shrimp and fish and lobster to the local restaurants that had been loyal to the company for decades. But by the time I was in middle school, the business was struggling. New management at restaurants switched to new wholesalers. Old regulars started scaling back the size of their orders. Money was tight. I pretended not to know, but Dad borrowed
 cash from Emmett’s father twice when I was in high school – just to keep us and the business barely afloat. “Yeah, I remember the warehouse doing… not so great for awhile,” Emmett admitted with a hint of guilt in his voice. “I used to overhear my dad talking to yours on the phone.” “It’s okay. Everyone knew we were struggling. They were just merciful and pretended not to,” I shrugged, trying to look blithe though my face was burning for my dad. He always tried so desperately to keep up with the Hoults. I actually didn’t find out till too late that all my childhood vacations to the Hamptons with Emmett’s family were damned near bankrupting Dad. He didn’t have the money they had, but he still tried so hard to keep that glamorous image. It was no surprise that it eventually all fell through. Dad couldn’t keep up with the Hoults’ lavish lifestyle, and after Emmett’s dad passed ten years ago, he no longer cared to try. He did, however, hold onto his dying company till about four years ago. “So four years ago. That was when he finally bit the bullet?” Emmett asked. “Yeah, he knew he had to sell, but he hated knowing he’d be selling to a competitor. He was like, ‘They won’t keep the name and we’ll just get wiped from history,’” I snorted, shaking my head. “So dramatic.” “Well, that company was his pride and joy. Even I remember.” “Yeah. His pride, his joy – the bane of his whole existence. I mean I did get it. I knew it hurt most because he wanted to make my grandpa proud and keep our family name alive.” “So you bought the company to keep it going,” Emmett said, a faint smile touching the corner of his lips. “Yep.” I had to grin a bit too because I was still fairly proud of myself for pulling this off. “I already had savings and I spent the next year busting my ass, working nonstop and living as frugally as possible so I could scrounge up the money to buy the company from Dad. But it wasn’t just buying the company I had to think about. I knew I needed something to revive the actual business, too.” “And that was the restaurant, right?” Emmett guessed. “Sure was,” I beamed. I had dreamed up Stanton Family Market as a way to revitalize the company’s image. People saw us as old, outdated, and I wanted to change their minds. So I pulled all my old work connections, landed a miracle investor, and ran a few pop-up restaurants in less expensive locations before finally opening up in East Hampton. I knew if I could make the café popular, I could make the company relevant again. So I created social media buzz with our over-the-top, admittedly overpriced smoked tuna and roe sandwiches, as well as our notoriously Instagram-able brunches, including that lobster claw Bloody Mary. I emailed a million food blogs and magazines to do write-ups about us. I was busting my ass to rebrand the Stanton Family name to something “cool and relevant.” And within a year of doing that, our orders at the warehouse started going up again. “That’s fucking nuts, Aly. Basically, you saved the shit out of your family business,” Emmett said, wearing a broad grin on his face. The fact that he sounded genuinely proud of me made my heart skip a beat. “So, do you ever plan on having a location that’s open for more than just the summer?” “I’d love to. And I’ve thought about it a lot, but it would only make sense to do that in the city, and I just don’t have the money for that yet,” I said. “And for now, I should concentrate on this first location.” “I gotta be honest, I looked it up the other day and you’ve got fuckin’ killer reviews,” Emmett grinned, watching me beam like an idiot. “I mean your dad has to be… I don’t know. Crazy happy? Over the moon?” I smiled awkwardly. “Oh God, my dad is… embarrassingly proud,” I said in a rush before taking a swig of my water. I tried to think of a subject change but right in time, my phone buzzed. “Oh,” I laughed when I saw the text. “It’s your mom.” “Really?” Emmett snorted as I read the message.  AUNT AUDREY: Oh no Aly!!! Emmett texted me that he’s actually staying in the Hamptons? I hope you’re not angry with me for promising you the house to yourself! He told me he’d be gone all summer!!  “Aww.” I giggled and showed Emmett the screen. As he laughed, I cocked my head. “Dude. Why did you tell your mom you’d be gone all summer?” I asked while texting Audrey some reassurance. “Because she was trying to set me up with her friends’ daughters.” “What, are they not pretty enough for your astronomical standards?” I teased. “They’re pretty,” Emmett said, making me irrationally jealous for a second. “But if my mom’s introducing me to someone, she’s suggesting I start a relationship with her, and like I said, I don’t do those.” “Have you literally never been in a relationship since high school?” I asked. “No, I was in one during college,” Emmett replied, giving no details beyond that. I blinked expectantly. “And… it just wasn’t any good?” “It was great.” “What? Then why did it end?” I asked. I knew I was pressing a bit hard, but I also couldn’t imagine a scenario that didn’t involve Emmett being the one who ended things. That was just who he was. In high school, after the two or three-month mark, he always found a reason to blindside his girlfriend and dump her. He was always so blithe about it too. While the poor girl usually spent a month or two recovering, Emmett just went on being Emmett – not having a care in the world. But judging from his dark expression right now, that maybe wasn’t the case with his last relationship. “I just didn’t have the time for it,” he said flatly, getting up to make a sandwich. “Any more questions?” he asked, eyeing me before opening the fridge. “No,” I said, mildly rattled by the return of Angry Emmett. I squirmed in my seat for the next few minutes, neither of us saying a word. Emmett made his food and I just sat there, staring at his muscled back and watching his shoulder blades move under his shirt. I wet my lips. “Dude. Did you see what happened with the game last night?” I asked suddenly, opting for some Empires talk to lighten the mood. I held my breath when he didn’t immediately answer. “No,” he finally said, prompting me to exhale. “I know we won, but I didn’t catch highlights.” “Well, apparently we went into extra innings,” I said eagerly. “Jennings hit the walk-off homer in the twelfth.” “Yeah?” Emmett peered over his shoulder, lifting his eyebrow with interest. “Pull up the video.” I eagerly pulled up the clip on my phone and airplayed it on the living room TV. From the kitchen, we watched the highlight and I breathed easy the second Emmett broke into a grin and said, “Fuck, yes. Amazing.” “Right?” “Jennings had to be our best pick-up this past off-season,” Emmett said. “Well, you can thank your owner brother for that,” I snorted, making him laugh. Phew. I breathed easy again because with that little exchange, the tension was gone. And for the rest of the night, he and I watched a replay of yesterday’s game. The only hiccup came when we were heading up to our rooms and I stupidly said, “I wish we saw that game live.” “What, you didn’t enjoy our movie night?” My heart thumped at the mention of last night, but I forced a snort and an eye roll to play off my nerves. “Dude. That movie kinda sucked,” I said as Emmett’s lips twisted into a knowing smirk. “Yeah, dude,” he eyed me. “It totally did.” I squinted. Crap. One look at the vaguely smug expression on his face, and just like that, I knew I’d fucked up. I’d overdone it with the word “dude” and Emmett could see right through it. He was totally mocking me for it. Dammit, Aly. The whole point of this night had been for the purpose of making things not weird between us and I had to go and mess it all up right at the very last minute. “So… you going to your room?” I asked Emmett as we headed up the stairs. “Where else would I be going?” I blinked, realizing I’d meant to ask “are you going to bed” but in my stupid awkwardness had totally said the wrong thing. “What, do you want me to come to your room?” Emmett asked, his teasing eye making me almost trip up the steps. Oh my God. “You’re funny,” I said, trying to play it off as we got to the second floor landing and parted ways. “Goodnight.” There was a laugh in Emmett’s voice as he called from his end of the call. “Goodnight,” I called back. But the weird feeling still clung to me even after I stepped in my room, so pulling up a funny video, I turned on my heel and headed for Emmett. I needed to end the night on a bona fide good note, and my solution to it was that BBC reporter whose kids waltzed into the background of his interview. It was the exact type of silly video we loved, and it was a perfect solution. But then I got to his room. “Omigod!” I yelped when my eyes landed on Emmett’s naked backside. That back. That ass. That was enough to paralyze me but then Emmett turned around and holy. Fucking. Shit. Blood rushed to my cheeks as I stared at his hard cock hanging heavily between his muscled thighs. He was big – fucking huge – and from root to tip, he was so thick and smooth I just wanted to reach out and touch it. My pussy throbbed as I imagined myself doing it. Can’t I? What if this moment between us just didn’t count? From head to toe, every inch of Emmett’s naked body was so fucking chiseled I was hypnotized. Almost delirious. I was convinced that every woman in the world deserved to see a body like this before she died. It was so sexy it made me feel sexy. It was carved to such masculine perfection that it flooded me with the most carnal thoughts – filthy images of being stripped naked, bent over and spread apart. The dirty thoughts crossed my mind just as Emmett growled at me. “Stop.” I blinked up in a daze. “W-what?” I breathed as his eyes fell to my lips. “Stop staring at my dick like you want to put it in your mouth.” Fuck. In my mind, I’d denied it. How dare you? I don’t want
 your cock! You pig! I don’t want anything to do with it! But in reality, I could only stand there. My legs were lead and my heart was hammering as Emmett stalked slowly over, his close-up nakedness rendering me both frozen and speechless as he stood in the door. “Aly.” He enunciated my name with a bite of irritation in his voice. “Why are you just standing there?” he asked, his gravelly voice sounding tight. Controlled. Blood rushed in my ears as he took another step forward – standing so close now that I swore his cock was an inch from grazing my belly. When he caught me trying to glance down, he clenched his jaw and lifted an eyebrow. “Do you want to touch it?” he asked, his dirty question piercing the silence of the hallway, sending a shameful rush of heat pooling in my panties. “Because unless that’s what you want, Aly,” he muttered harshly, “you better fucking turn around and go to your room.” My heart slammed. I never thought I’d take well to hearing “go to your room” as an adult but tonight was an exception, so before I could do something remarkably stupid, I spun on my heel – pussy wet and cheeks burning as I made a panicked beeline for my room.            10  ALY    It was barely noon but I let Evie make me a stronger-than-usual Bloody Mary to drink in the office. Because I was a fucking wreck. I had never hated myself while masturbating, but that was what I did last night after seeing Emmett naked – especially since I imagined him doing the same in his room down the hall. Out of guilt, I eventually turned to porn. But while the guys in those videos once looked good to me, they did zilch for me last night. I felt nothing. Not after seeing Emmett Hoult in all his rock-hard, full-frontal, nine-inch glory. His image was burned into my mind and worse, I’d used it to come three times before bed last night. On the bright side, I’d passed out and slept like a champ. On the not so bright side, that meant climaxing to the thought of Emmett was just as good if not better than having actual sex with another human. And that only made me think about how good he had to be in bed. “Unless you want this right now you better fucking turn around and go to your room.” Every mental replay of his words sent a new shiver up my spine. I kept imagining scenarios in which I hadn’t gone to my room. I kept wondering what Emmett would’ve done to me if I’d just stepped inside, and those fantasies had my panties so wet and uncomfortable that Evie actually volunteered to hold down the fort at the restaurant while I went to buy new ones. But instead, I opted for the Bloody Mary. “Okay.” Evie eyed me warily as I took the drink from her and held it in both hands like a child, staring into space as I sipped on it. “You do look miserable enough that I’m going to spare you of like, eighty percent of the filthy questions I want to ask right now, because I know you don’t want to hear it.” I nodded catatonically, still sucking down my drink. “So, here’s the deal. You have two options here, okay?” she started, sitting authoritatively in her chair. “One – you stop getting in your head and just fuck Emmett already. You know you want to, he knows you want to, so just leave the past in the past and let the man make it up to you in orgasms. Right?” I winced. “Wrong. Even if I were able to miraculously forget the past and sleep with him, we’d still have to consider that it could get awkward or complicated between us, which could result in me having to move out, which we are still very much trying to avoid because how are you and Mike by the way?” “We fooled around last night but when I touched his dick, he put my hand back in my lap. At which point my soul died and we started fighting,” Evie sighed, letting me take her hand and squeeze it. “So yeah, point taken. No fucking Emmett and no sex for either of us. Yippee,” she muttered. But in the same breath she gasped. “Wait. What the hell am I talking about? Just because you can’t fuck Emmett doesn’t mean you can’t fuck any of the other babes in town!” “Yeah, but we’ve been over this,” I mumbled. “I’m not hitting the club again, I don’t trust Tinder and I’m not going to date any of our ‘cute regulars’ because that looks unprofessional.” “So what, we just have to pray that some miracle hottie just lands in your lap?” Evie asked incredulously. Before I could answer, one of our waitresses barged in. “Holy shit!” Evie yelped. “Hannah! What’s up?” I asked, surprised that she’d come in without knocking. “I’m sorry,” Hannah blurted, her eyes wild as she talked faster than usual. “I just – there’s a guy outside asking for you, Aly.” My eyes fluttered. “Who?” “I don’t know his name. I just know that he’s really hot and a bunch of paparazzi followed him here. They’re taking pictures through the window.” “What?” Jumping up, Evie and I followed Hannah outside and upon spotting said gentleman sitting at my raw bar, I gasped. Holy what. I knew exactly who he was, but I couldn’t believe it. And as my feet floated toward him, I couldn’t help but stare. He was tall. Built. Huge. He had dark blond hair and light green eyes I was used to seeing under the bill of an Empires cap. Without his uniform, he looked exactly as he looked on TV, but I was still in denial. I told myself I was just wasted off that Bloody Mary. I refused to believe it could really be him. But then he held out his hand to me and spoke in that famously cocky low voice. “Aly, right?” he said. “It’s nice to meet you. I’m Drew Maddox.”            11  EMMETT    I’d jacked it more today than I had in all of last month. It was all I could do to keep myself from driving to Aly’s work so I could find her, grab her and fuck her over the closest surface. My blood hadn’t stopped rushing since last night. Watching my dick entrance Aly might’ve been the hottest thing I’d ever seen in my life, but it was also fucking painful to remember that she did want me. This past week, I’d been focusing so hard on acting platonic that I forgot the fact that the woman I wanted most actually wanted me back. And now I couldn’t stop imagining every way I would’ve fucked her last night. Sitting in bed, I leaned against my headboard, tipping my head back as I tightened my grip on my cock. I was at it again, jerking off as I thought of Aly’s tits bouncing in my face as she rode me in bed. I imagined her digging her nails into my shoulders as she sank her tight pussy down my every rock-hard inch till she could feel my balls pressed up against her tight ass. She’d give me the sexiest little moans as I licked and teased her nipples before sucking them into my mouth like the sweetest fucking candy. “Fuck,” I groaned. My pulse picked up as I milked my dick, squeezing harder toward the swollen tip and easing up on the way down. I could feel the pre-cum seeping from me as I thought of Aly touching herself last night, writhing in bed with her shirt pushed up above her bouncing tits. I could practically hear her little gasps and her whimpering as she played with her pussy, one hand stroking her clit as the other pushed two fingers deep inside. “Ah, Christ…” I groaned. My thighs tensed as I felt my hot release barreling toward the head of my cock. Just the thought of her swollen lips as she stared last night was enough to make me come – and harder than I ever had in my life. I was damn near dizzy from the amount of sperm I was losing but once I got my shit together, I went downstairs to find my phone still buzzing like it’d been when I left it. I’d abandoned it on the kitchen counter because Drew had been texting me cryptic shit all morning. It was weird. I had no idea what any of his vague questions were getting at and I still didn’t now.   DREW: The Post wrote yesterday that I’m unpredictable and have a problem with authority DREW: Do you agree DREW: I didn’t till today   I stared. I really didn’t have the mind for this.   ME: Dude. What are you talking about?   It took ten minutes for him to reply.   DREW: They also pointed out that I have a perfect record anytime my opponent trash talks because I respond well to direct challenges ME: I’ve noticed but why are you telling me all this DREW: You said you were never going to let me talk to her or meet her DREW: Also according to The Post: I tend to do the opposite of what I’m told   I stared. My immediate reaction was to call Drew, but he didn’t pick up so I furiously texted him back.   ME: Maddox what the fuck you’re talking about DREW: I’m talking about how I told you to close with Ellie but you didn’t so I’m taking her to dinner tomorrow night.   It took me half a second to realize he was talking about Aly. Once I did, my heart raced so fast I barely remembered calling Drew again, but suddenly, his voice was in my ear. “Emmett.” His greeting was particularly jovial because he knew I was fucking irate. “Is this a fucking joke, Maddox?” “No, this is me being petty because you missed the party I threw for Iain. Also, I tried the lobster roll at Ellie’s restaurant – it’s fucking amazing. Have you had it?” “Her name is Aly, jackass, and you do realize I’ll fucking kill you if you lay so much as a finger on her, right?” “Well, I value my life so I’ll just have tantric sex with her. How about that?” “Drew – ” “You shouldn’t have waited so long to make a move, Emmett. You snooze you lose.” I was in the middle of firing back but hung up the second I heard keys in the front door. Without thinking, I hung up on Drew and rushed for the door, swinging it open with Aly’s keys still inside. “Emmett! What the hell are you – ” “Where did you even meet Drew today?” I demanded. “Did he come into the restaurant?” Aly blinked twice and just like that, her shock turned into scorn and she stormed right past me. “Why does it matter, Emmett?” Her voice trembled as my eyes devoured her ass in that blue dress. “You and I have an agreement, remember? We’re supposed to
 be – ” “Friends. Yeah. I know,” I ground out as I caught up to her in the kitchen. “But for friends, we’ve definitely seen each other naked way too many fucking times.” “Emmett, please,” Aly hissed. A lock of blonde fell from her ponytail as she spun around, pinning an angry, pleading stare at me. “You know I can’t do this with you. You said that if I lived here, we’d be platonic – you promised.” “What’s platonic about you staring last night instead of walking away?” “What’s normal about changing with the door open when you have a roommate?” “I’ve lived alone my whole fucking adult life, Aly, sorry I haven’t changed every one of my habits for you yet.” “You’re being an asshole right now,” she hissed. “And you’re in denial,” I seethed. “You want me just as badly as I want you. You’re only going on a date with Drew to get me out of your head. I’ve seen girls do it before and you’re no different.” “Emmett, please don’t talk like you know anything about me anymore, because you don’t!” “No shit, Aly, that’s why it’s fucking killing me that you’re about to spend a night talking to Drew and telling him everything I’ve been dying to know about you for twelve fucking years,” I growled so close to her that I could feel her tits grazing my abs. Guilt flashed in her eyes but all she did was glare at me in stubborn silence. “I want to know where you’ve been, what you’ve done – I want to know everything I can about you, Aly, because all I know right now is the fact that you won’t let yourself be with me despite the fact that you want me, and it’s driving me fucking insane!” “What if I don’t want you?” Aly challenged hotly. “I know you do,” I muttered furiously. “Aside from the fact that I saw it last night, I saw it the night at the club. Did you already forget what happened then?” I asked, taking full advantage of Aly’s pissed-off silence. “Because if you did let me remind you that you looked at me like you wanted me to fuck you right in that bathroom. You came home with me, you straddled me and you begged me for more of everything I did to that perfect fucking body of yours, so if you want to tell me that you don’t want me, then at least explain that night to me. Because I don’t think I’d ever felt a wetter pussy in my life,” I snarled, her bright pink cheeks sending blood rushing fast to my cock. God, she looked too fucking good like this. Her chest heaved as she returned the blazing fire in my eyes. But another two seconds of our standoff, and Aly was gone, storming upstairs and shutting the door to her room. “Fuck,” I muttered, dragging a hand across my jaw and cursing my dick for being hard as a fucking rock. I was pretty damned sure I couldn’t feel any more tortured than I did in that second, but suddenly the show I had playing on the living room TV flickered off. My eyes were still blazing as I cut them to the screen to see what the hell was going on. Before I knew what was happening, a video appeared. I caught a glimpse of a girl in a white top and pink panties before my eyes flashed over the words on the screen. SEXY GIRL PUNISHED FOR SPYING ON CHANGING ROOMMATE. I stared. Holy fuck. It took a second for me to realize what was happening – that Aly’s phone was still connected to the TV through airplay. Which meant she was in her room right now. Watching goddamned roommate porn. Blood rushed in my ears as I bounded upstairs in two seconds flat and burst into her room.            12  ALY    “Are you fucking kidding me, Aly?” Fuck. “You weren’t supposed to see that!” I blurted, trembling with both fury and mortification as Emmett barreled toward me. “Are you trying to fuck with me right now?” he seethed, his chest stretching his shirt tight with every harsh breath he sucked in. “Do you want me to punish you for staring at my cock last night? Is that what you want?” “No!” “Then why were you watching that video?” He walked me back against my bed. “Why were you watching fucking roommate porn if you don’t want me to fuck you?” he demanded. “Tell me.” Wildfire danced behind his blue eyes, searing into me. I started a dozen comebacks but couldn’t finish one. There was no point. They all sucked. I couldn’t talk myself out of this hole because what just happened was clear: I’d run upstairs to blow off steam. I was trying to get off to the thought of Emmett so I wouldn’t fuck Emmett and there was no denying that after what just happened. “Just admit that you want me,” Emmett growled. All I could see were his pecs as he backed me up against my bed. “I don’t, Emmett!” I shoved him back before I fell onto my mattress. “So just get out of my room!” “Why? So you can touch your pussy?” he rasped as I shoved him again. This time, he barely moved. “So you can make yourself come while I jack off down the hall? Is that what you want to do again?” I stared at him, hot over the fact that he knew what happened last night. We both did. I blinked hard to fend off the images of him jerking it to me in his bed. I shoved him once more but this time he held my hands tight against his chest. “Fuck you,” I hissed as he ran my palms down to his abs. But my brain short-circuited as I soaked in the heat of his muscle under my fingers. They pulsed against him, curling against his solid ridges and next thing I knew, I was running my hands all over that steel torso of his. Shit. I had no idea when the switch flipped. All I knew was that my nails were digging into Emmett’s chest as he slammed a kiss onto my lips. The taste of his tongue shocked me. It felt too intimate. It unraveled me on contact, shattering everything I knew so within seconds, I shoved him away. A tortured protest flared in his eyes till I spoke. “Kiss me somewhere else,” I panted, our eyes locked intensely on one another. I wasn’t sure what I was saying, what he was thinking, but before I knew what had happened, he’d me spun around. I stared at the bed as I felt his hands yank my skirt up to my waist. “Emmett!” I gasped when he spanked my ass and cupped my pussy from behind. As his middle finger teased my clit, my legs buckled, and as I fell onto the bed, he jerked my panties down to my thighs. I had barely any time to react before I felt the warmth of his tongue sliding into my pussy. “Oh my God.” I gripped handfuls of bed sheet as he gripped my thighs and shocked me stiff with his dexterous tongue. Every muscle in my body squeezed tight as Emmett gave strokes so long, so deep inside me that I felt paralyzed with pleasure. My breath quivered as his hands slid up my thighs to my ass, administering another brutal spank to my left cheek before his thumbs spread my pussy open for his mouth. I tore at the sheets, and a cry burst from my lips as Emmett swirled that skilled tongue, switching from sliding in and out of my pussy to licking its length up and down. “Is this what you meant when you asked me to kiss you somewhere else?” Emmett murmured as he slid three fingers easily inside me. I was soaked. Dripping wet. I was in such ecstasy I was only vaguely aware of his belt buckle jangling open. I didn’t fully process what I’d heard till I made out the sound of Emmett grunting with pleasure, jerking his cock as he finger-fucked my pussy from behind. Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. “Tell me how good it feels.” He slowed his stroke when I didn’t reply. “It feels good,” I gasped, my pussy literally aching for him as he withdrew his fingers. “Dammit, Emmett, don’t stop – it feels so fucking good.” “Tell me what you thought about when you touched yourself last night.” “You,” I breathed as cold air hit my naked, throbbing pussy. “I imagined you fucking me in your bed, now please just – oh God.” I moaned when instead of his fingers, I felt his tongue on me again. He gave three long wet licks before rumbling deep from his chest and flipping me onto my back. I caught one glimpse of his swollen cock hanging out of his jeans before he threw my legs over his shoulders and slid his hands under my ass. Squeezing two handfuls, he brought my pussy to his mouth, groaning as he pulsed his hot tongue against my clit. I gasped for air. I couldn’t breathe – not with a million different sounds of pleasure hurtling out from my lips. I’d never heard them from myself before, and I could tell Emmett loved every single one because they made him squeeze my ass tighter and lick my pussy so hard I felt out of control. “Emmett… I’m going to come.” I arched my back as I felt that blissful pleasure building inside me. Emmett had a hand clamped over my breast now. He massaged it roughly over my clothes as he lapped greedily at me, coaxing my juices out then running the flat of his tongue up the length of my pussy. He was ravenous, devouring me like his last meal. The orgasm that hit me was sudden and shook my whole body, but even then, Emmett didn’t stop. He yanked me to the edge of the bed. He sent shudders up my spine as he palmed a handful of my wetness, using it to jerk his cock while kneeling on the floor and sucking my clit till I came again. And again. Holy fuck. I thanked God that the third orgasm was tiny because my body couldn’t take anymore. I was thoroughly rocked by pleasure as I lay on the bed – breathless, useless and so thoroughly spent that all I wanted was to fall right asleep. I wanted to badly. I easily could. But I wouldn’t let myself. For reasons that ranged from gratitude to some twisted sense of competition, I wanted to return the favor to Emmett. He was grinning lazily now as he gazed at my limp body, my panting chest. He looked almost smug – so satisfied with his handiwork that I felt this strange prickling need to prove that I could render him equally useless. “Aly, what – ” Emmett groaned the rest of his sentence as I knelt at the edge of the bed and wrapped my hands around his cock. “Holy fuck.” His stare was heavy-lidded but rapt on me as I licked the flared head of his dick with just the tip of
 my tongue, teasing it for a few seconds before sucking it into my mouth. “Oh… fuck.” He thrust his hands in my hair, rocking his hips gently with my every long, wet pull on his shaft. Within ten seconds of being wrapped tight around his thickness, my lips started to tingle. And for some reason, I loved the feeling. I loved it so much I felt guilt creeping up. I tried to remind myself of what was going on – what the hell I was doing. I have Emmett Hoult’s cock in my mouth. The thought was supposed to send me crashing back to reality but it only made me want to come a fourth time. Try as I might, I couldn’t feel the remorse I was supposed to feel succumbing to Emmett Hoult. I was too fucking wet. Too hot. My body was still buzzing with bliss and I was already addicted to the satisfaction that came with making Emmett groan. “Christ, Aly…” It was hard not to love the sound when he was so big and strong. His body of pure muscle was so much bigger than mine and yet I had him at my mercy. His dick twitched in my hand as I licked his tip like a lollipop. His breaths were short and ragged, and his brows were pinched in awe as he gazed down and simply soaked me in. “God, you’re so fucking beautiful,” Emmett hissed, shaking his head. “You don’t know how fucking good this feels. You… oh fuck.” He rolled his head back. His abs clenched and he thrust his hands in his hair as I took in as much of him as I could in my mouth and my throat. “Holy fuck, Aly. Suck it. Yes... fuck, baby, just like that. Keep sucking just like that.” My lips were numb and it only added to my high of knowing I had all six feet and three inches of Emmett twitching, flexing – shuddering at my touch. My mouth full, I peered up at him again, my pussy clenching at the sight of pleasure twisting his gorgeous features. His perfect jaw was tight. His teeth were gnashed and with his eyes squeezed shut for a second, I peeled off the top of my dress, surprising him when I took his hand and cupped it over my naked breast. His eyes shot open, remaining wide as he gazed down in awe to watch me suck him off while using his hand to massage my breast. Barely a second of that, and I felt him further harden in my mouth. I could actually feel the hot rush of pleasure surging up his shaft. “Aly…” Emmett started his warning. “I’m going to come,” he rasped, his eyes unblinking because I didn’t stop. I kept my lips wrapped around his cock and my eyes pinned to his face. There was something both so sexy and sweet about how Emmett held off for as long as possible before processing my intention to take his every drop in my mouth. “Holy shit, baby,” he hissed when the realization hit. Then with a jerk forward, he finally let himself come – squeezing a handful of my hair and growling from deep in his chest as he pumped stream after stream of liquid heat onto my tongue.            13  EMMETT    Considering I’d passed out next to Aly and spent the night dreaming about everything we’d done, I should’ve woken up on a high. But I knew the second I opened my eyes that something was off, and it had nothing to do with the fact that she was gone. She had work. I knew that. I had mentally prepped myself to wake up to an empty bed in the morning. I needed to prepare myself for that after last night – after watching Aly suck my dick like a porn star, swallow every drop of my cum and then make this sexy little half-yawn, half-moan sound before letting herself fall back into bed. “’Night,” she’d breathed, her eyes heavy but still open as I flopped down next to her. I expected her to protest and send me back to my own room, but she didn’t. Instead, we stared at each other for a few sleepy, intensely intimate seconds. Then she drifted off to sleep and I told myself not to get used to the feeling. As good as it felt, I reminded myself that I wasn’t going to wake up to find her sleeping against my chest. She was going to be in five hours and I was going to wake up alone. I was already prepared for all that. But I wasn’t prepared for the part about this morning that made me feel suspicious. Blame it on the dresser across from the bed. The top drawer was left wide open and something about that didn’t sit right with me, so flying up from bed, I went to confirm what I already suspected: That all of Aly’s things were gone. “Fuck,” I hissed. Second drawer, third, closet – everything was empty and before I knew it, I was yanking my shirt and jeans on, my pulse racing out of control as I flew out the door and down the hall. I’d promised both Julian and myself awhile back that I’d never bother Aly at work, but fuck it. Today, I clearly had nothing left to lose. * * *  ALY  The restaurant was packed. Literally every seat, including all six at the raw bar, was taken – and from what I could tell, my guests were all happy and satisfied. And normally I’d be thrilled by that. But right now, I was desperately wishing for everyone to just leave, because unless my anxious mind had imagined it, Emmett’s truck had just turned into our lot. “Shit,” I hissed, my hands shaking as I put in the order for my regulars at the bar. Hannah had called out this morning with a fever, which meant the tiny restaurant was way understaffed. Evie was drowning in double the paperwork in the office, and I was alone on the floor. With one hand still putting in orders, I used my free one to grab my phone out of my apron and send a text. * * * ME: MAYDAY pretty sure Emmett is here please come outside so we can switch spots Evie and I had loosely planned for this moment after I’d come in with all my packed bags. If and when Emmett came, we’d switch posts and she’d insist that I hadn’t come in to work. We’d gone over that. But we hadn’t gone over the part where she might not answer her cell since she was busy pleading on the phone with the New York State Liquor Authority about our expiring license. Crap. I could just see her getting so worked up in the office that she’d completely forgotten about her phone. After calling to no avail, I opted for a second text.  ME: Evie!!!!! Come outside please!!!!  I hit send with my thumb but before it could even deliver, I heard our door chime sound off louder than usual. The air hitched in my throat and I froze, simply staring ahead at my computer screen and praying to God that it was someone else who’d just walked in. But then I heard my regulars at the bar start to whisper. “Holy shit, Quinn. Do you see that?” “Girl, I saw that out the window. That’s the babe who owns Blue Harbor.” Fuck. “Lord, he is gah-orgeous. I would let him do filthy, filthy thing to – ” “Shh! He’s coming to the bar.” I heard Quinn’s hiss just as my peripherals processed the tall figure suddenly standing right in front of me. Emmett. Obviously. He stood there in front of the computer I was on, and I didn’t have to look up to know that he was pissed. I didn’t have to look up to know that every seat at the raw bar was hawking me as Emmett stood there – towering, silent and rigid as he waited for me to acknowledge him. Fuck, fuck, shit, fuck. I breathed deep as I finished putting in the order. With all my guests watching, I did my best to gather myself before looking up. But the second I did, the storm of emotions hit me like a punch to the gut. I was prepared for his anger, but I wasn’t prepared for the simultaneous hurt in his eyes. I wasn’t prepared for the pleading look that twisted his gorgeous features as he stood still in the middle of my bustling restaurant, silently asking me why the hell I’d packed my things this morning. I was already breathless from two seconds of looking at him, but with a glance at my guests, I still tried my best to look professional. “Can I help you?” I asked, my voice cracking in the process. Emmett narrowed his eyes for a second. “Really?” he finally said, keeping his stare pinned so mercilessly on me that I felt my knees go weak. Goddammit. Right away, I looked around for a waitress or busser or someone I could ask to get Evie for me, but everyone was running around, far too busy to notice my look of distress. “What, you couldn’t make it more than a week?” My head snapped back when I heard Emmett’s question. I stared in disbelief. “Are you really trying to dare me into staying, Emmett? Because I’m not thirteen anymore, and it’s not going to work,” I hissed. “Why are you doing this?” he asked. “I can’t talk about this right now,” I muttered with a self-conscious glance at Quinn and her friend. They were wide-eyed, looking both tantalized but guilty as they watched my personal drama unfold. “Seriously, Emmett,” I whispered just loud enough for him to hear. “Please don’t do this to me here. Not at work.” “Then where, Aly? Because I know you’re not going to come home tonight.” My heart twisted. I wasn’t sure why his phrasing made me so sad, but it did, and suddenly I was waving over my hostess to take over while I talked to Emmett outside. Rounding the corner, I walked us away from the window and out of sight of my captivated audience at the bar. I tried not to get distracted by the gorgeous girls who passed by and checked Emmett out so hard I felt that stupid, nonsensical pang of possessiveness. Are you fucking nuts? I asked myself because in what world did it make sense to reject a man but hate the idea of him being with somebody else? See? This was another reason why it couldn’t work. Because like he always did, Emmett made me crazy. He made me angry and sensitive and irrational, and I couldn’t afford to feel this scattered for a second longer. “This is far enough, Aly – just fucking talk to me already,” Emmett demanded, his footsteps finally stopping behind me. My heart was pounding as I spun around to find him standing there, arms out, looking somehow pissed off, fired up and exasperated all at once. “What is it? Huh? What are you leaving for? Just tell me that.” I felt my throat already trembling
 as I tried to word my reply. “If you really need to know, Emmett, it’s because I woke up this morning and felt like shit about myself,” I confessed harshly, my stomach clenching at the instant look of hurt on his face. “I cried in the bathroom for ten minutes because as good as I felt last night, I felt stupid this morning. I remembered the fact that I don’t trust you, Emmett. Every time I think long enough about you, I feel angry. I feel embarrassed and stupid and lonely, so even if I did want you, in what world would it make sense for me to be with you?” I demanded, my eyes stinging. “Answer me that.” “Who’s the one you’re really pissed at? You answer me that,” Emmett sneered as he came close to me. “You think I’m the enemy, Aly, but if you just take a second to remember everything that happened twelve years ago instead of running from it and sticking to whatever story you made up in your head, you’ll know that as much as I fucked with you in high school, I’m not the one who’s really your problem. I’m not the one who ruined everything. You just want it to be me.” My stomach lurched. “No.” I shook my head adamantly. “That’s not true, that’s  – ” Fuck. I searched myself for a comeback but came up pathetically empty. “You know what, I can’t talk right now, Emmett,” I muttered, feeling the heat of his glare as I rushed past him. “No, you won’t talk about this – now or ever, because you don’t like thinking about how I’m just your scapegoat,” Emmett ground out as he followed. “You don’t like thinking about how it’s easier to blame me and let the real asshole off scot-free.” His words hit me like a sledgehammer but I refused to react. My heart was pounding out of my chest by the time I reached the door, but like some kind of masochist, I turned around when he said my name and let him drop one last scathing remark. “You lied to yourself all these years, Aly, and I let you because I knew you were hurting. I figured I might as well let you believe what you wanted, because I was never going to see you again,” Emmett growled furiously. “But now that you’re here, I can say it – I’m not the one who made your life miserable. It wasn’t me, and fuck it, I’m done letting you pretend that it was,” he seethed before turning around and forcing me to stare at his back as he walked away.            14  ALY    Had anyone told me even a week ago that I’d have a date with Drew Maddox but desperately not want to go, I’d have probably laughed in their face and continued my giddy Empires fangirling. I mean for God’s sake, the man was literally my favorite player on my favorite team. The team I’d grown up watching with my family. Yet I wasn’t remotely excited to see him. “Evie… no,” I protested weakly as she sat on the floor next to her closet, taking out her one and only box of Louboutins. “Seriously. I can’t.” “Except you can,” she countered, opening the box. “And you will,” she added, crawling over to manually insert my feet into each glossy, patent leather pump. Sitting at the end of her bed, I raised my eyebrows. Damn. They felt incredible and if I didn’t feel so incredibly shitty and confused since yesterday morning, I would’ve probably wept over the glory of having Louboutins on my feet. “I mean you have to look good, Aly. You’re going on a date with Jude Maddox.” “Drew Maddox.” “Whatever. If he’s the type to draw paparazzi, you need to be camera ready, and nothing says camera ready like red soles,” Evie declared just as Mike called into the bedroom from the kitchen. “Evie! Are we out of frozen pizzas?” “Yes!” I could practically hear Mike’s shoulders slump. “Dude. What am I supposed to eat for dinner then?” Evie’s jaw dropped and turned her wide eyes to me as if to ask can you believe this shit? “Please refrain from dude-ing me, Michael – I sent you a text that said ‘remember frozen pizzas’ when you were at the grocery store! So don’t talk to me about your dinner – okay?” Evie shouted back, heaving a massive sigh as she turned back to me again. “See?” she lowered her voice. “If you had any doubts about why you need to go out tonight, it’s because one day you might spend your Friday arguing with your fiancé about frozen pizzas. So before that happens, you better have all the fun in the world, and that starts with you looking happy that you’ve got this severely hot date.” “I know. I just…” Don’t know how to have fun when I keep thinking about Emmett. I wanted to confess that much to Evie, but I also didn’t want to tell her the details about yesterday’s run-in outside the restaurant. I was still processing it myself – specifically everything Emmett said. You lied to yourself all these years, and I let you because I knew you were hurting. But I’m not the one who ruined everything. You just want it to be me. I kept telling myself it wasn’t true. I couldn’t sleep a wink last night at the motel, so I spent evening till sunrise trying to tell myself why Emmett was wrong. I mean he was the one who tortured me throughout high school. He was the one who ratted on me at the end of junior year. To everyone. He’d cost me my home, my reputation – all the friends I’d known since childhood. These were the arguments that had been working for more than a decade, but after being called out by Emmett, they weren’t fully convincing me anymore. Somehow, they were falling flat. “Aly? You said you wanted this dress, right?” Evie said, waving a hand in my eye line to draw my stare back to the slinky number in her hands. I blinked at it. Then at her. I was tempted to finally ask Evie about what she really thought ten years ago – on the first and last night we’d spoken about the junior year fight between Emmett and me. I had a feeling it was time to finally talk about it. Even if it meant facing every lie I’d convinced myself of in the past twelve years. Every lie I’d molded my entire life for. For the first time in forever, I felt almost brave enough to talk about it. But just as I opened my mouth, a text pinged in my phone. “Oh, no!” Eyes wide, Evie crawled over to where it sat charging and looked at me. “Shit, Drew says he’s outside!” she said, tossing me the dress. “Hurry, hurry! Put that on!” I caught the dress as a frantic Evie rushed up to help me squeeze into it. And just like that, the moment was gone.            15  ALY    Evie’s dress was tight, short and a blush pink color that bordered on nude. It was a perfect match with the Louboutins on my feet, which Drew raised his eyebrows at as he helped me out of the car. “Yeah, I don’t know how you girls walk in those, but I’m not complaining,” he chuckled, his green eyes sweeping up my legs before he put a hand on my back and ushered me into the restaurant. The second we walked through the doors, eyes were on us because, well, Drew. But since we had so much immediate attention, I did my best to look less nervous and more excited. I mean I’d technically been wanting to come here for awhile. The name of the restaurant was Cantina. They were known for their lobster tacos and being the town’s toughest reservation – mostly because celebrities like Drew Maddox liked to spend their Friday nights there. “I take it you come here a lot?” I said, making crappy conversation as Drew and I bypassed the massive wait at the door. As we followed the hostess to our table, I could feel the eyes of the crowd following us – or maybe just Drew. “Yeah, we’ve been coming here pretty much twice a week,” he said as I let myself take him in for the first time tonight. He looked like a Viking with his long-ish dark blond hair and massive build. He was about the same height as Emmett, but his muscle wasn’t nearly as lean. It bulged against the light grey shirt he was wearing and made me wonder if he was even comfortable under there. I mean he definitely could’ve gone a half-size up on the shirt, I thought before scrunching up my face at myself. Because that’s what you should be doing right now – criticizing the way Drew Maddox dresses. I shook my head, trying to physically shake away my negative thoughts. Seriously, why are you being so weird? I asked myself though in the back of my head, I knew the answer. I was nitpicking Drew to explain to myself why I wasn’t completely thrilled to be here. I wasn’t even a little excited. I felt restless and antsy – like I had unfinished business hanging in the air. All I wanted was to go home, but I didn’t even know what that meant because I certainly didn’t think of the motel when I thought of home, and I wasn’t thinking of Evie’s place either. Which meant I was probably thinking of Emmett’s. Really? I asked myself. For God’s sake, I had been the one to push him away. I had been the one convinced that I couldn’t be around him because he made me feel like shit. But for the past twenty-four hours, I’d been questioning my reality as I knew it. Because with Emmett’s harsh words yesterday, I felt the dam starting to break. I’d built it ages ago to keep away the truth, but now it was starting to seep through me, forcing me to realize that maybe I had in fact altered the story for my own sake. That maybe Emmett wasn’t the bad guy. And I was just an idiot in denial. Fuck, I cursed, completely overwhelmed and steeped in my own paranoia till Drew laughed to break me out of my haze. “Well, shit. What do you know,” he said. I blinked up at him. “Huh?” “Should’ve figured. The whole crew’s here,” he said, nodding over at the group of beautiful people at the bar. My pulse picked up the second I looked over at the wall of well-dressed guys and willowy girls in mini-skirts and giant heels. There had to be almost a dozen people there, laughing, drinking and having a glamorously fabulous time. But all I saw was that V-shaped back I knew too well. Emmett’s. Holy shit. He was here but crazier than that was the fact that I was – wait was I? My eyes fluttered when I realized I was relieved. Practically happy to see
 him. “Shall we go say hi?” Drew asked. “Okay,” I blurted, a bit dazed as I let my heeled feet float over to the bar. And just like that, I was walking voluntarily toward Emmett, my heart pounding as I waited for him to notice me. But instead, a figure in a red dress burst out from the group to greet us first, and my heart sank when I realized who it was. Britt Heatherton. “Drewsie-poo!” Britt gasped, arms outstretched. “Christ, that nickname sucks,” Drew said, letting her lean in for a kiss as Emmett turned around in his chair. My heart pounded the moment those blue eyes landed on me, because I wasn’t used to this look on him. His gaze devoured me on contact. It flickered over the sweetheart neckline of my dress before landing on my single layer of lipstick. But that lasted all of a second before he turned away, his face devoid of even a twitch of expression till Drew greeted him. “Hey, asshole,” Drew laughed, holding out a hand for that handshake-hug thing that guys just naturally did. It prompted an unreadable look from Emmett, though his lips did slightly curve into some kind of smirk as he eyed Drew. “What’s up,” Emmett said just as Britt stopped sizing me up and suddenly gasped. “Whoa. Wait. Seafood Girl?” She clasped a hand over her mouth. “I didn’t even realize it was you! Omigod! Who would’ve guessed that you could clean up so well?” Drew snorted as I stared at her. “Thanks. I’m sure.” “Oh, it’s a compliment! Duh,” Britt giggled, her bright eyes on me as she wrapped her lithe arms around Emmett’s neck. “So funny that you’re here because E and I were just saying how we’re the only two who haven’t eaten yet. So if you’ve got extra room at your table…” She trailed off to give two exaggerated winks while literally narrating herself. “Wink, wink. Hint, hint. What do you say, Drewy?” “I’m sure that’s fine.” My eyebrows went up at the reply, and it took a second for me to realize that it hadn’t come from Drew but from me. I blushed as all three heads turned to me. “Yeah?” Drew said, looking surprised but delighted. I caught the smirk he shot Emmett before saying, “Shit, Ellie’s right. This could be fun.” I would’ve reacted to the fact that he got my name wrong, but I was too distracted by Emmett’s stare and Britt’s ridiculously high-pitched squeal. “Yay, yay! Double date! Double date!” she chanted, hugging Emmett’s arm between her boobs before leaning over to whisper something to him. I should’ve looked away, but all I did was return the empty stare Emmett pinned on me as Britt giggled with her lips so close to his ear that I was convinced she might lick it. Heat rushed to my cheeks because when she finished whatever she was saying, I spotted the slightest hint of a smile curve Emmett’s lips. It was barely there, but my heart pounded and my brain went into overdrive. They had sex before they came here. Or they’re planning on having sex when they leave. Maybe they already had sex in the bathroom. I was so on edge so instantly that I jumped when Drew touched my back. “Shall we? The hostess is waiting,” he said, draping a heavy arm over my shoulders and bringing me over to our corner booth for four. My body was rigid as we walked ahead of Emmett and Britt, and I did my best to eavesdrop on whatever he was muttering to her, but all I heard was her giggling response. “Why, dirty boy? So you can stare at my ass?” Ugh. What the hell did I just get myself into?            16  ALY    Karma. The word played on repeat in my head because I was convinced this was it. I’d said yes to Drew’s dinner invitation a few days ago to get Emmett out of my head. I wanted so desperately to have anything to distract myself from him. But now, despite Drew Maddox sitting next to me in a tight booth, all I could do was stare at Emmett. Angry Emmett. He hadn’t looked at me once, and he hadn’t said a word to anyone since sitting down. That said he did lean back whenever Britt wanted to whisper in his ear, and he didn’t remove her hand whenever she let it rest in his lap. This is karma, Aly. This is what you get, I decided, bouncing my knee restlessly under the table as I watched Britt once again burst out laughing at something and slap her hand onto Emmett’s thigh. But this time, she started moving it in a circle, massaging him. Her hand stayed there even as she launched into some story about her vacation last year to Mexico, and I couldn’t help my racing pulse as I stared at it, watching it inch closer and closer to Emmett’s dick as she rambled on. My cheeks burned at the thought of her touching him there. But they burned even harder when I looked up to find Emmett’s eyes on me. My neck tightened, and I held my breath in my throat as for the next few seconds, we stared at one another, both of us well aware of the fact that Britt’s hand was closing in on his cock. For a moment, I was convinced Emmett was punishing me, watching me just to revel in my reaction when she finally palmed it and started stroking under the table. Really, Emmett? I groaned inwardly. But before she could reach it, Emmett sat up straight, removing Britt’s hand from his lap and prompting me to let go of the breath I didn’t even know I was holding. “Whoa. You alright?” Drew turned to me, raising his eyebrows as he looked down my body. “Christ. You’re jiggling.” My eyes went wide as I looked down at my heaving chest in my too-tight dress. Drew smirked. “I was talking about your knee, but yeah. That too.” “Oh.” I blushed hard, realizing what a mess I was acting like. “Sorry. About the fidgeting,” I blurted, forcing myself to stop jiggling my leg under the table. But two seconds later, I started again, making Drew both groan and laugh as he clamped his massive hand down on my knee. “You gotta stop,” he said, his long fingers squeezing me so tight I felt a shiver run up my spine. But it wasn’t so much a result of his touch as it was my peripherals detecting Emmett’s shift across the table. Sitting slack before, he was suddenly tense. Rigid. I could see his shoulders broadening with every breath he drew in, and I didn’t have to look over to know that his eyes were locked intently on me. Not only could I feel the heat of his stare, I could sense Britt’s growing impatience for the fact that she was losing her audience. “Excuse me, I do believe I was talking,” she said in singsong to play off what I could only guess was genuine irritation. At this point, she was so adamant about having Emmett pay full attention that she cupped his jaw in her hand and manually forced him to face her. “Babe. You’re gonna wanna hear this part,” she grinned flirtatiously. “It’s the part where I got a little too drunk after the mezcal tour and skinny dipped in the pool – in front of everyone,” she giggled, throwing in another one of her winks. As she went on about that, Drew leaned in close. “Hey. So I need to confess something,” he murmured, his breath tickling my ear as my breath hitched in my throat. He’d been squeezing the hell out of my bare knee a minute ago, so I was briefly afraid that he’d tell me he wanted to go home now and touch the rest of my body. But instead he took me by surprise. “I’m kind of only here to be a dick,” Drew rasped. My eyes fluttered over to him. “What?” He’d just knocked back the last of his drink – his third in less than an hour – so his eyes were bleary and his voice was a bit slurred. “Yeah, so I’m pretty sure you know this since you two have been eye-banging all night, but Emmett wants you.” His gaze drifted off for a second as he laughed to himself. “Like… bad.” I blinked. “I, um… yes. I do know.” I frowned as I watched Drew rattle the ice in his empty glass and drunkenly lose his thought. “So, you’re here because what? You just want to fuck with him?” I asked, desperate to keep him on track. “Yeah. That’s pretty much what we do to each other,” he laughed. “Though, actually,” he corrected himself. “I am here to enjoy the fact that you’re my date, ‘cause you do look beautiful and that dress is… pretty fuckin’ killer,” he grinned, letting his sleepy gaze fall down the front of Evie’s nude dress. But clearing his throat, he sat back up. “But that said, I’m not actually trying to take you home tonight. Unless Emmett magically loses interest in you, which… I assure you he won’t… I’m just here to torture him as payback for some petty shit. That make any sense or did I drink too much? ‘Cause I just drank a lot.” I managed a laugh, feeling vaguely though not entirely relieved. “Um… I think that makes some sense. Why are you drinking so fast though?” I whispered. “’Cause that’s what it takes to survive a night with this Beth chick,” he said, handing me my margarita. “So bottoms up. ‘Cause she’s still going on about Oaxaca.” We shared a laugh as Britt took another five minutes to wrap up her story about her Mexican mezcal tour. “Oh my God, it was amazing. Actually, I still have some distributor contacts in case you’re interested in carrying their mezcal at your restaurant, Aly,” Britt said with a smile. “Oh.” I was surprised, since it was actually a nice, genuine offer. “Well, that’s really kind of you but I feel like most of the booze people seem to want at the restaurant is wine, beer and Bloody Marys on the weekend,” I said, watching Britt visibly deflate at my rejection of her offer. “But hey, who knows,” I brightened. “Maybe I’ll order some for my dad. He loves mezcal. I should definitely have at least a bottle for the day he visits.” Britt’s eyes lit up as she cocked her head. “You’ve been open for more than three months and your dad hasn’t visited yet?” Her laugh was incredulous. “Isn’t opening your first restaurant kind of a big deal for you?” “Oh.” I paused, blinking as I wondered how the hell the conversation got here. “Yes. It is a big deal.” “Does your dad live far away?” “I’d say so,” I answered slowly, trying to give a casual shrug. A knot formed in my throat,
 and I attempted to put on a good face for Britt, but my smile was already quivering at the edges. “What state does he live in?” “Oh, he’s… not out of state. He lives in New York. In Brooklyn. But you know, it’s more than a two hour drive away.” “Pshhh, that’s nothing when it comes to visiting your own daughter! Especially when she’s at like, a huge turning point in her life,” Britt exclaimed. “But maybe that’s just me? I’m just like, so close to my dad. I can’t even imagine him not wanting to visit me if I – ” “Hey.” Emmett’s first word of the night came to cut her off brusquely. “Why don’t you stop talking about that? Recommend me another drink or something,” he muttered, sounding annoyed. “Ooh! You bet!” Britt perked up immediately, grabbing the cocktail menu. But before she went to reading it, she looked up at me with a pout on her glossy lips. “I’m really sorry about your dad, Aly. It sucks that he just refuses to see you.” Heat coursed through my veins and I stared at Britt as she looked down at the menu. I wanted to ask myself what the fuck had just happened, but then I remembered that Britt was seated at the raw bar the third time my dad canceled his reservation. In anticipation of him, I’d had the entire staff set up the nice corner table with a three-tiered pastry stand, a pitcher of fresh OJ and a bottle of Veuve Cliquot on ice. When I finally finished running around the kitchen and the dining room to make sure everything was place, I went to catch a breather in the office and text my dad for his ETA. It was at that point that I saw he’d sent a five-word text thirty minutes ago. Tired. Gonna take a raincheck. No “sorry” included. I’d kept it together in the office, and had every intention of doing so in the dining room. But the second I told Evie and felt her arms around me, I started crying. Something Britt unfortunately witnessed. “What the hell was that?” Drew whispered in my ear. Even in his drunken state, he could tell I was seething. “Nothing.” I turned away to dab the wetness in my eye with my knuckle. I hated that I’d actually let the comment get to me but I also couldn’t fathom how Britt could be so malicious to someone she barely knew. “It was just… a low blow to piss me off,” I muttered between my chattering teeth. Drew rubbed his eyes, frowning across the table then at me. “Well, why don’t we piss her off right back?” I bit down hard to stop my teeth from chattering. “What do you suggest?” “Something that requires pissing off Emmett too,” Drew replied. “That okay?” With a bitter shrug, I said, “Do what you gotta do.” And within seconds, I gasped because Drew’s lips were on my neck. My eyes shot wide open, promptly met with the fire of Emmett’s gaze. The hollow of his cheeks flexed as he clenched his jaw tight, and his chest visibly tensed as Drew kissed up my neck for another second or two before pulling away. “Drew.” The stern warning in Emmett’s voice sent a shudder to my thighs. “Let me talk to you for a second,” he muttered, nodding out the booth. Drew flashed a grin of drunken content. He was the epitome of disrespect as he said, “Nah, bro, I’m good,” before returning his attention to me. He brought his mouth close to my ear before murmuring his giddy question. “He pissed?” “I think so,” I breathed, stunned. “How ‘bout her?” “I – I don’t know.” “All good. I got this,” Drew said. Facing forward, he took a drink of my margarita before turning back with a grin. “I get any salt on my lips?” he asked. I was rattled. I wasn’t sure what that had to do with anything, but I still peered down to check. The second I did, Drew’s rough hand caught my jaw and he closed his hot mouth over mine, kissing me for a solid two seconds before I heard Emmett jerk forward in his seat and actually growl at Britt. “Get out. Please.” She protested with an indignant squeak but apparently obliged because before I knew it, Drew was being ripped away from me laughing. “Whoa, hey – what’s this?” he feigned shock but gave me a puckish, tongue-out grin as Emmett literally dragged his long body out of the booth. Holy fuck. On his feet, Drew dusted off his front and faked half-convincing fury as he demanded to know what was going on. But Emmett was no longer looking at him. His hot stare was once again fixed on me, and this time, there was a look of finality to it – like his patience was officially exhausted. “Meet me outside,” he muttered, collecting my purse off the table. “I’m taking you home.”            17  ALY    It was a tense ride home to say the least. Funny enough, it was the same car and the same driver who’d taken us home after we “met” at the club, but the air in the backseat was a stark contrast to that night. Instead of hot and heavy, we were silent and still. I sat on my side and Emmett sat on his, his legs spread wide, his elbow propped on the window as he stared out at passing cars. Wringing my hands, I watched him, trying to figure out what I could possibly say to get us talking. There were clearly a million things hanging in the air – long-buried topics of conversation that had finally wrestled their ways back to the forefronts of our minds. I didn’t know where to start, so eventually, I just blurted something out. “Bet you didn’t know that he hadn’t visited me yet,” I said, forcing a laugh like it was something funny. But appropriately, my laugh came out bitter. My heart beat fast when Emmett looked at me, and it hammered even faster when he said nothing. “Pretty embarrassing to think about,” I whispered, shaking my head at myself. “I didn’t want to make him the enemy because that would mean I’d spent my life trying to please the bad guy,” I murmured. My gaze floated off to stare at nothing as I felt more than a decade’s worth of confession starting to tumble from my lips. “I mean every decision I’ve ever made – chopping my hair, rejecting girly stuff, copying everything you did for as long as I could – it was all in the hopes of winning his approval,” I murmured, forcing a laugh as my tears blurred the red of the traffic lights out the windshield. “And God, I just hate to think it.” A teardrop fell down my cheek as I rolled my eyes at myself. “I hate to think that for the past four years, I’ve busted my ass and dedicated my whole life to saving this company for nothing. Because I’m pretty sure I only did it for a last shot at his approval. Just for the fighting chance that he might finally like me as much as he likes you.” There. I said it. The words were out and now I felt numb. And small. And stupid. They were all the things I was used to feeling around Emmett, because no matter how hard I tried, and how little he did, I was always second best. I was my father’s only child, but I wasn’t his favorite. Not even close. My bottom lip wobbled as Emmett finally spoke, his whisper piercing the stillness in the air. “I was never comfortable with it, Aly. None of us were.” I closed my eyes. God. So embarrassing. “We all saw the way he treated you, and trust me, we hated it. Me and Mom especially,” Emmett said. “I hated that he came to my games instead of your plays. I hated the way he just lost interest in a conversation when you started talking. It was so fucked up and awkward. I mean as a kid, I’m pretty sure I thought it was funny. But by the time I was in high school, I remember thinking it was weird that your dad was so obsessed with hearing about my teammates or whoever I was dating or anything going on in my life.” From the corner of my eye, I could see Emmett looking at me, but I couldn’t look back. “I knew something was screwed up, Aly. But our dads – they grew up together, and my dad could only see yours through rose-colored glasses. And I was a stupid, lazy kid so I just tried to ignore it. I didn’t bother myself with how you were probably hurting. It was too much trouble for me. The one time I talked to my dad about yours, he got pissed at me for being disrespectful, and I hated when he was mad at me. I didn’t know how to handle it.” “Because you weren’t used to it. You were his favorite. You were everyone’s favorite. You had no idea what it was like to be born into another person’s shadow,” I said, tears falling into my hands as I dropped my eyes into my lap. “I never had a chance to be someone who mattered. Even in school with my closest friends, I felt like no one liked me for me. People only hung out with me to hear about you – what our vacations were like together, what you were like outside of school. When I went up to adults, they looked tired of me before I even started talking. They were just anticipating me complaining about something you did, some prank you pulled on me, and it annoyed them to have to discipline you. Because everyone loved you most. My dad included.” I was still staring through a wall of tears when I heard the shift of Emmett moving closer to me. He cupped my face in his hands, his lips close to mine as he whispered I’m sorry on repeat. “I didn’t know. I had no idea it was this bad for you, Aly,” he said, shaking his head. “Everything was just a joke to me then. I didn’t know what pain felt like. I couldn’t empathize. I was a fucking idiot, and I’m so sorry.” I cried harder at the sound of him saying sorry. The sincerity of his words felt so good, but they only neutralized the pain of the memories flickering vividly through my brain. “I hated that you gave him the excuse to finally get rid of me,” I muttered, flashing back to that dramatic day at the end of junior year. I stared at my hands on Emmett’s chest, avoiding his stare because I’d felt it harden as we moved toward the topic of our big fight. “What you did that day… when you ratted me out. Somewhere in the back of my head, I knew you were right, but I convinced myself you only did it to torture me like you always did. You took away half my friends by hooking up with them – I figured you were just trying to take
 away another thing that I loved.” “You didn’t love Scott,” Emmett corrected me, his voice steely. My heart thumped at the mention of the guy’s name. It had been so long since anyone around me had said it out loud. Just hearing it again made my face burn from my cheeks to my ears. “Of course I didn’t love him, Emmett. I was just lonely. Constantly,” I whispered, my throat wobbling as I forced myself to look him in the eye. “I didn’t have real friends. I didn’t have a dad who wanted to even look in my direction. My mom was constantly defending him. Mr. Scott was just… my first time experiencing someone who was interested in me. Someone who was actually interested in listening to me.” His attention had been so flattering back then. I didn’t consider that our relationship was wrong. I thought people just “didn’t understand our bond.” What started between us was friendship, and it was the only thing I had to look forward to at the time. Mr. Scott taught English and World Film, and sometime during sophomore year, I’d developed the habit of sitting in his room after the last bell and watching old movies as he graded papers in the dark. Other days, when he didn’t have so much work to do, he’d just listen to me vent. And thanks to Emmett, I had plenty to vent about. It wasn’t till junior year that Scott started acting differently. I’d caught him eyeing my body before, but now he was letting me catch him. He mentioned how much I’d changed over the summer. And one day after school – it was a winter day, and I’d been crying over something Emmett did – Mr. Scott kissed me. It was my first kiss. And it felt so nice. It felt magical. All of it did, really. Somehow, I only found it romantic that Scott forced me to keep us a secret, and I thought nothing of the fact that he’d spent a year not so subtly trying to ask me to have sex. The day Emmett walked in on us was the second day of what Mr. Scott had called us “easing into things.” “He was thirty-five years old and he had his fucking hand between your legs,” Emmett growled, setting my cheeks on fire. “He was a fucking predator and I still fantasize about beating the fucking shit out of him. Maybe I should have done it differently, but I’ll never regret what I did that day.” I could see that moment clearly again. I remembered the way the color drained from Emmett’s face when he saw us. I remembered how he stood still for the longest second in history before charging forward, using all six feet and two inches of his lean muscle to completely body Mr. Scott. I didn’t even know what exactly he did. It was just a blur that ended in Scott on the ground and Emmett in my face, demanding what the fuck I was thinking while trying to drag me out of the room. When I resisted, he ran out and told the first person he saw about what he’d just witnessed. That person happened to be a teacher, but the girls down the hall weren’t. They were gossipy sophomores who told everyone what they heard, and from that day forward, I became the freak. The leper. A couple friends stuck by me. They swooned over what Emmett did, but they comforted me over what happened for a week, or however long it was till that morning that Dad told me not to go to school. He didn’t even sit me down before dropping the bombshell. I was staying home for the final two weeks of junior year, and I’d be attending senior year at a boarding school in Canada. “You’re going to stay with Aunt Carla for the summer. I’ve got too much to worry about to handle you when you’re this out of control,” he said before going to work. I still remembered that because the truth was, despite what I’d done with Mr. Scott, I wasn’t out of control. I came home at the same time every day, did my homework, helped Mom with dinner, and went to bed before midnight. My friends only came over for a few hours at a time, and I never ever went to parties. I wasn’t out of control. I was just lost and lonely. And maybe a little neglected. But rather than look for what led to this, Dad used the situation as his excuse to give up on me. He’d never wanted me, never cared for me and now, thanks to Emmett ratting me out, he finally had his reason to stop having to deal with me. And since it hurt more than I could bear, I placed all blame on Emmett. It was easier that way. Over the years, I twisted the details of what happened to me. I made up false memories of Dad being worried. Crying over what had happened to me. I pretended that he sent me away because he didn’t want me near the pain of what happened to me at school. It was easy to live by those lies when I cut off all contact with Emmett. He sent me messages on Facebook, but I deactivated my account. He tried passing messages through my mom, but I told her to never speak of him again. By the time I graduated college, I’d made a new life and a new social circle for myself. I went back to seeing my parents every once in awhile, even talking about the game with Dad on the phone. Hearing him laugh with me felt nice. Talking sports felt normal. It made it easier to pretend we’d always been like this. So when it came time to sell Stanton Family Seafood, it seemed obvious that buying the company was my chance at finally and fully winning his heart. And while there was an initial excitement, it eventually waned – especially when I opened my restaurant. Especially when it started doing well. Gaining press. Earning glowing reviews. He’d said the restaurant was pointless – a waste of money – but then orders started piling back into the warehouse. And instead of being proud, or happy to be proven wrong, Dad was bitter. “He’s not proud,” I muttered as Emmett held me against his chest. “He’s just embarrassed that his daughter did what he couldn’t. And I think he hates me for it.” “He doesn’t hate you,” Emmett whispered, tucking a lock of hair behind my ear. “I don’t know,” I said tiredly, staring out the rearview window. “He definitely doesn’t love me. I don’t know if he ever did.” “Well, I do,” Emmett said easily, drawing my wet eyes to him fast. He smiled at my look of surprise. “Loving you is the oldest memory I have,” he said as I stared through my tears at him. “You were a part of my life for as long as I can remember. All my best memories were with you. I know I messed with you a lot, but in the end, I always loved you, and I don’t think I really knew it till that day I found you after school,” he said softly, the lights from outside moving over his features. “And trust me, I’ll never regret what I did that day, but I’ll always regret the fact that I lost you after. I missed you so fucking much, Aly. I had no idea what you meant to me until you were gone.” I took a moment to soak in his words. To revel in them, really. I didn’t know I could feel this high right after feeling so low. Actually, I didn’t know I could feel this high at all. “Well, you’ve got twelve years on me,” I murmured in return. “Because I don’t think I knew what you meant to me until I came back.” I felt bad saying it, but Emmett hit me with that classic grin of his, so I couldn’t help but smile with him. “Hey, I’ll take it,” he said, leaning in to brush his lips against mine. “As long as we both know it now.”            18  ALY    I woke up probably an hour after I’d drifted to sleep. That was pretty much par for the course, but what wasn’t was the fact that I’d woken alone in Emmett’s bed, his TV still on the same channel we’d left it. The blue glow lit the room as I sat up and remembered the fact that I’d cried a bit longer after we’d gotten into the house. Nothing crazy. Just leftovers of the tears I’d started in the car. I needed to get the rest out of me, so sitting on the steps in Evie’s nicest dress and shoes, I let it all out. And as I did, Emmett sat beside me, draping my legs over his lap and every so often pulling my forehead to his lips for a kiss. It was so sweet I couldn’t believe it was real. I could finally admit to myself now that as a kid, I’d seen Emmett as the highest prize – something completely unattainable. I couldn’t be as good as him. I definitely couldn’t have him. He was the ultimate jock reserved for the prettiest girls. So I told myself I didn’t want him. It was a defense mechanism, but honestly, what teenage girl didn’t want a boy who put Abercrombie models to shame? I wanted him then. Badly. I just hated myself for it. I wouldn’t even let myself fully enjoy the times that he and I laughed together on the weekends, because on Monday, we’d always wind up back at school, and he’d always wind up mobbed by pretty girls and teammates while I sat alone in some corner. Alone in the flickering blue light of his room, I laughed at myself. Now that all my skeletons were out of the closet, I had the capacity to think about silly things – like the fact that I was in the bed of the prom king from my high school. I wish I could’ve told you that you’d somehow wind up here, I thought, talking to my sixteen-year-old self just as I heard Emmett’s voice at the door. “Hey.” I looked up to find him standing there, holding a glass of water from the kitchen. The light of the TV draped over his pecs and his abs, emphasizing his athletic build as he walked slowly over to me. “You’re awake,” he said. “And you’re naked,” I countered. He looked down at himself and laughed. “I’m wearing boxers,” he said, his stare groggy as he dragged it all over my body. I was still wearing Evie’s dress, but it was twisted askew from being asleep, and stretched so low on my breasts that my right nipple was actually halfway out. I saw the exact second Emmett noticed because his eyebrows went up and his cock noticeably twitched under his blue boxer briefs. Biting my lip, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes. “Do you want to take them off?” I asked. He blinked himself a bit more awake. “My boxers?” “Mm-hm.” A grin spread his lips as he stood at the end of the bed. “You first.”
 His murmur was husky as he palmed the length of his cock, and his gaze was heavy as he watched me get on my knees. “Show me your pussy,” he said, exhaling a groan when I pulled my skirt up to flash my white lace thong. “Pull your panties aside. Let me see you play with your clit,” he said, reaching into his boxers and pulling out his fully hard cock. He jerked it as I fulfilled his requests, holding my thong aside and gently stroking my clit. It was like a flood in my panties as Emmett pinned that intense stare on me, watching me so intently I couldn’t help but feel beautiful. Sexy. I bit my grin as the sleep in his eyes flickered into a familiar lust. It grew bigger, hungrier as I picked up the pace, so aroused I could actually hear my own wetness. “So fucking sexy,” Emmett muttered under his breath. “Get naked for me,” he said, his wolfish gaze glued to me as I peeled the stretchy dress the rest of the way off my body. By the time I was down to just panties, he was on top of me, catching my jaw and gazing between my lips. “You made me watch you kiss Drew tonight,” he muttered, his eyes pinned on me as he yanked my panties down. Heat throbbed between my legs when his cock fell heavily between my thighs, resting inches from my naked pussy. Yes. Please. Now. I reached down between us to touch him but he caught my hand, making me moan with anticipation. I wanted him inside me this instant, but he was making me work for it. “Show me those lips are mine,” Emmett murmured, his eyes on my mouth as he nudged my thighs apart, spreading my legs to tease my wet pussy with the naked head of his dick. It glided smoothly up the length of my sex, pulling a moan from my lips every time it rubbed against my clit. “Again,” I begged. “Show me first,” he countered. I didn’t think twice. Pulling his face to mine, I kissed Emmett deeply, tasting him like a forbidden fruit. A groan rumbled in his throat as our tongues swept furiously against each other, breaking down the last of the flimsy wall I’d put up to resist him. I was officially done for. Even if I wanted to curb all desire for him, there was no chance of it now. His lips fit too perfectly against mine, and he tasted so damned good I refused to break contact even as I moaned from the pleasure of his cock parting my folds. It teased slowly along my pussy, his smooth tip rubbing my clit every couple of seconds, then more and more till he was massaging it, stroking circles around it till my stomach was clenching. He didn’t stop kissing me when I came. All he did was release the root of his cock and dip his fingers into my wetness. “Holy shit,” he murmured, his mouth curving against mine as our lips stayed locked. “I think I’m wet enough to fit you now,” I giggled, my words finally breaking our kiss. Pulling away, Emmett stared at me for a second. Then he shook his head. “My fucking dream girl,” he muttered under his breath before kissing me again and reaching over our heads to grab a condom from the nightstand. * * *  EMMETT  Fuck, she was so sweet. She was everything I had fantasized about for twelve years and more. Every arch of her back. Every moan from her lips. Everything she did, every little sound she made reminded me of how bad I’d missed and wanted her for so fucking long. I had never let myself think about it much. I never once talked about it out loud. It wasn’t worth it when I wasn’t sure I’d see her ever again, but now that she was here – now that she was fucking kissing me with those sweet lips as she rolled the condom over my cock – I could let myself feel it all again. “Easy,” I murmured as she pulled away from my kiss to watch as she lowered herself onto my cock. Christ. I could practically feel the fucking stars in my eyes as I stared at her. She just looked so damned cute biting her lip and straddling me as I sat up in bed, leaning back on the headboard. She’d picked the position and I’d wholeheartedly approved because it gave me access to every part of her body. It let me kiss her mouth, her tits. It let me look into her big eyes as I grabbed handfuls of her ass and watched her sink her pussy slowly down the length of my shaft. “Oh my God…” Aly dug her nails into my shoulders, breathing out hard as she relaxed all the way to the base of my cock. My eyes briefly rolled into the back of my head. Holy shit. I tightened my grip on her as a groan tore out from deep in my chest because fucking hell, she felt good. She was so wet and so warm – so incredibly fucking tight I could’ve come right then and there. “Christ, Aly,” I exhaled. “You’re incredible.” It was a massive fucking understatement but it was all I had. I felt too good to think. The fact that I could speak was nothing short of a miracle because for fuck’s sake, I had Aly Stanton naked in my bed, giving me the sweetest little moans as she swiveled her hips around me. “Good girl,” I murmured, watching those parted lips of hers curve into a tiny but fucking irresistible grin. Her tits were bouncing the way I couldn’t resist but I couldn’t even look. I couldn’t tear my eyes off of her beautiful face as she found a rhythm, making herself at home on my cock. Once I knew she felt good, I helped myself to her body. I circled my arms around her and dipped her backwards, hugging her little waist to my chest as I pushed her full tits into my mouth. I was fucking fixated on them. That much was for sure. I’d always been an ass man but Aly’s tits were my weakness. I couldn’t get enough. I didn’t bother being quiet as I licked them all over and sucked her nipples between my lips. “Emmett,” Aly gasped as I repositioned her, laying her on her back without releasing her from my mouth or slipping an inch from her pussy. She shuddered underneath me, wrapping her legs around my back and grabbing fistfuls of the sheets as I took over the top. “You don’t have to hold back,” she panted breathlessly. “I can take more.” Fuck, that alone was enough to make my dick twitch in her pussy. From my rolling pace, I went to pumping faster inside her. “More,” Aly murmured, digging her fingers into my ass and pulling me deeper into her pussy. Holy fucking hell. She was so small and delicate underneath me, her pussy wrapped so tight around my cock. It felt like I could break her yet here she was, urging me to fuck her harder. “Tell me how that feels,” I rasped against her neck as I felt her pussy clenching tight around me. “Does that feel good, baby?” “Yes… I think I…” She cut herself off with a breathless moan that made my dick jerk inside her. “Do it. Come for me, baby.” Gripping her hips, I plunged deep inside her, filling her with every inch of my cock. Her heels dug into my lower back as I grinded tight against her clit, letting myself drown in all the breathy, sexy, fucking addicting sounds of her pleasure. I knew already I was hooked on them. I wanted to collect every little one of them. Though I knew the three words she gasped next would always be by far my favorite. “I’m coming, Emmett.” The muscles in my glutes burned as I pounded inside her, bringing us both to the edge. Her pussy clenched like a vise around me, and I could’ve sworn right there that I’d never felt so damned good in my life. But then my name poured from her lips as she came all over my cock. And just like that, I had a new standard for what it meant to feel good.            19  EMMETT    I was pretty sure I hadn’t dreamt holding Aly against my chest while sleeping last night. But I couldn’t be sure because by the time I woke up, she was gone. My bedroom door was slightly open and clearly, Ozzy had come in sometime this morning because now he chewing on a tennis ball in his bed next to the window. “Dammit,” I muttered to myself when I looked at the clock. It was a quarter past ten, which meant Aly had left for work more than four hours ago. Flopping on my back again, I thrust my hands in my hair, groaning out something that was half-frustration, half-leftover bliss. I wished that I’d woken up in time to catch Aly – but I also wasn’t going to complain about anything this morning. Not when I’d had the best night of my life last night. The only giveaway that it wasn’t a dream was the fact that the T-shirt I’d given Aly to sleep in last night still smelled like her. I couldn’t help bringing it with me to the bathroom, briefly holding it to my lips and breathing in her sweet scent. It was fucking intoxicating. It made me want to drop everything, hop in my truck and drive right to where she was. I was still so drunk off of her that I wouldn’t think twice about walking in her restaurant, bending her over the counter and fucking another screaming orgasm out of those beautiful lips. I needed to taste her skin. I needed to hear those sweet fucking sounds again. Of course, doing all that in front of everyone at work would probably break at least a couple laws, so I reined in my urges and jacked it in the shower. The pressure built up faster than ever as I relived last night. Remembering her moans made my balls churn hard, and one thought of what she said about fitting my cock in her pussy and I was down for the count. My palm pulsed against wet tile and my head fell back as I pumped out two thick jets of cum I could easily picture glistening on Aly’s stomach. Fuck. Jacking off was supposed to help me control my urges but apparently, when it came to Aly, it just started me up again. I was ready to go for round two. I definitely had more than enough hot memories to work off of, but I could hear my phone ringing off the hook on my nightstand so finishing up in the shower, I turned off the faucet and forced myself to hop out. When I got back to my room, I found three missed calls on my phone. One from Britt. Two from Mom. I called Mom back first. “Emmett. You’ve been ignoring my calls,” Mom greeted me after one ring. As usual, I could barely say hi before she went into whatever speech
 she had saved up for me. “You know, I’ll give you some credit for texting me to let me know that you are in New York this summer, but at some point, I’d expect you to call and explain why you lied about being away. To your own mother. Who loves you.” I laughed, rubbing the back of my neck as I stood in front of my window and stared out at the street. “I don’t know, Ma. I think it might’ve been the two-page list of friends’ daughters that you emailed me. Gotta say, that was a bit of a buzzkill.” “I wasn’t telling you to show all of them around, I just thought you’d pick one or two to meet if the dates of their visits matched up with your availability. What’s so hard about that?” “Nothing. Everything. I don’t know.” I ran my hand through my hair as I turned away from the window. “The real question is why you even believed that I’d be gone that long. I’ve never just upped and done that.” Mom was quiet for a second. “I don’t know, Emmett. I just assumed that maybe you’d finally gotten tired of everything and just… run off.” Something in my chest twisted as I heard her sigh. “Honestly, a part of me hoped that you were really leaving for that long, because Lord knows you deserve it.” “Stop.” “I do mean it though, Emmett. As your mother, it would make me happy if I knew you could spend even a few weeks away. Just so you can get a breather. You could go to a resort or maybe some – ” “Ma,” I interrupted. “New subject.” She sighed again. “Fine, moving on,” she said, though it took her a second to think of something new to say. “How’s Aly? Are you two getting along okay?” I snorted at her question. It made me feel like a kid again because it was always what she asked every week or so, after she figured Aly and I had enough time to “cool off” from our last fight. Not that we ever had real fights. At least not till the big one junior year. I honestly never thought we’d get to talk about that again, let alone make peace about it. But last night was miraculous – in more ways than one – and somehow, Aly and I were finally over our hurdle. “She and I are getting along just fine,” I answered Mom, smirking at my own massive understatement. “I feel bad that I promised her the house to herself and now you two are spending the summer under the same roof. Especially since you had that little falling out. I know it’s never quite been the same between you since.” That “little” falling out. Yeah. My parents obviously knew about what happened to cause Aly and my fight. The entire school knew. But years after all that shit went down, I lied to my mom and said that Aly had finally responded to my messages and we’d buried the hatchet. I kept the lie up by saying that we talked here and there, that I’d met her once or twice for lunch, but that we were no longer close. It was for Aly’s sake more than mine. My mom had been in the hospital the day Aly was born – she loved her like a daughter, but she was also fiercely protective of me in a way that she wasn’t with even Julian. Maybe it was because I was the younger one. Maybe it was the fact that I was the one who was around during her darkest times. Whatever it was, it meant that there was no doubt in my mind that she’d take it personally and lash out at Aly for ignoring my attempts at contact. And considering how much Aly had always craved my mother’s approval, I couldn’t do that to her. “Well, if your roommate situation is peachy, that’s one less thing for me to worry about,” Mom said. “Anyway, now that I know you are not in the Maldives, will you be making it to the game this Sunday? Gram misses you and Ozzy.” “Of course,” I said. Sundays at home were on autopilot for me. For as long as I could remember, I spent Sundays at Empire Stadium with my family. It had been a tradition since I was a baby – one that included Aly’s family, too. Of course now, the tradition had us sitting not in the bleachers but a VIP suite behind home plate. Perks of being related to the owner. “Perfect,” Mom said. “And feel free to bring Aly. I don’t think she’s watched the game from our suite yet.” “Sounds good. But I thought I wasn’t allowed to bring girls to Sunday games,” I grinned. “Well, Sunday is a family day, so no bringing girls unless they’re serious girlfriends. You know that,” Mom lectured. “But Aly is different. I know she’ll never be your girlfriend – Lord, I wish – but she’ll always be a part of the family.” I held in my laugh. There was no reason for Mom to suspect anything romantic between Aly and myself, but I still didn’t want to tip off her ultra-sensitive radar when it came to my dating life. I could only imagine how she’d react if she found out that Aly and I were any kind of involved. She’d probably sob for hours and have wedding invitations out by the end of the week. Just the thought made me shudder. “Anyway, Ma, I gotta go. Someone’s calling me.” “A girl?” I took my phone off my ear to look at who was calling. “It’s Britt.” “Oh. Her,” Mom said bluntly. “That reminds me, you do need a date for the gala next week. Not her though.” “Yeah,” I said vaguely. “I mean it, Emmett. You’re hosting it, so you cannot show up solo. Not unless you want me and all my friends pushing their daughters on you.” “Alright, Mom,” I forced a laugh despite my exasperation. Leave it to her to remind me of how much I wasn’t into commitment. “I have to go though,” I said. It was just a line at first but then I remembered I really had to. “Shit. I just realized I’m supposed to have a meeting with Britt about the gala today. Fuck.” “Language.” “Sorry,” I winced. “I gotta go though. Love you, Ma. Tell Gram I say hi.” “Love you too, Emmett, and will do,” Mom said with a smile in her voice. She was always good at going straight from pissed to happy again. At least with me. “Please pick up the next time I call though, alright? And give my grandkid a hug for me. Bye.” I laughed and rolled my eyes when I hung up, but I still turned to Ozzy and said, “Grandma says hi.” Mom called herself “Grandma” around him enough that his ears perked up when he heard the G word. Most days, he cocked his head as if to ask, “Well? Are we going to see Grandma or not?” but today, he just went back to annihilating his tennis ball. I sensed he had aggression to get out for being kicked out of his spot in my bed last night. I laughed as I made a mental note to get him some new toys to make up for that. Then with a grimace, I listened to Britt’s voicemail and opted to text her back instead of call.   ME: Sorry I completely forgot about the meeting. Yes we’re still on for noon. BRITT: All good sweetie. How’s the headache?   I squinted for a second before I realized what Britt was talking about. I’d barely thought about whatever excuse I’d given to get away from her at Cantina last night. From what I recalled now, I made up something about being irritable from a bad migraine. I was under no impression that Britt believed me but she never seemed to call people out when they lied. She did it so often herself that she didn’t think twice.   ME: I’m better thanks. I’ll meet you at Blue Harbor at noon. Usual table. BRITT: Let’s switch it up for once. I’m already doing my 10:30 meeting at your little friend’s restaurant. Wrapping up soon so meet me here later. It’ll be like a reunion of last night. ;)   I stared at her text for three seconds then grumbled, “Shit.” For some reason, I didn’t trust Britt to behave herself around Aly today. I wasn’t the best at reading the subtleties of girls’ interactions with other girls, but it didn’t really take a genius to know that Britt was less than pleased with being ignored throughout dinner last night – and then bailed on no less. So hurrying into my closet, I tore off my towel and got dressed in about thirty seconds flat. Another thirty seconds, and I had Ozzy in his harness and both of us out the door.            20  ALY    Opening your restaurant has transformed the Stanton Family name from just a company to a brand. Tell us a little about the journey it took to get here. Chewing my nail, I stared at the email interview on my laptop like it was a Calculus test from high school. It was an easy enough question. I had sought out specific jobs to get close to specific people – basically network my way into knowing how to run a business. I totally knew the answer to this question. I just had no idea where to start because twelve hours later, I was still reeling from what happened last night. I was still processing the fact that I’d had sex with Emmett Hoult – and woken up without an ounce of regret. Disbelief? Sure. Nerves? You bet. But no regret. And because of that, I’d made it through only two questions of this interview so far – and I’d started it well over two hours ago. “I’d exchange assignments with you, but you know the answers better,” Evie said, grinning at her laptop as she did the scheduling for next week. Tuesdays at the restaurant were slightly less busy than weekends, which meant that instead of the office, we did our work on the floor at the little corner table between the raw bar and window. Peering over the top of her screen, Evie smirked. “Also, you don’t deserve to have the best sex of your life and get all your work done for you the next morning. That’s entirely too much good fortune in a short period of time, and we don’t want to spoil you,” she said, giggling when I looked up and shook my head at her. “Seriously though, can you give me the details of how he made you come with just the head of his dick? I need to know the logistics of that. For science.” “First off, no. Second, can you not talk about his dick so loudly in front of our staff? I think that might be blatant sexual harassment,” I said, nodding at poor Teddy behind the raw bar. He was an oyster-shucking ace but he was also a shy nineteen-year-old kid who was blushing furiously while trying to pretend he couldn’t hear us. “Okay, I’ll whisper,”
 Evie whispered. “So, like, was he using his dick like a vibrator against your clit, or – ” “Evie!” I hissed. “How was your night last night?” I asked hastily. “Oof. Talk about a boner-killer. Well, as you know, we were out of frozen pizzas,” Evie started, tapping away on her keyboard. “But we did agree on something the therapist emailed us. He said something about how Mike and I need to hang out together with each other’s friends, because watching your significant other interact with other people is supposed to remind you of what you love about them or whatever. So whenever you and Emmett are ready, I’ve got a double date with your names on it,” Evie said. But then she snorted. “Unless you’re still recovering from last night’s double date.” “It was definitely… a doozy.” “Yeah, I’d think so, because it’s got you using the word ‘doozy,’” Evie laughed. “I want to thoroughly make fun of you for that but I’ll give you a break.” “How weirdly merciful of you,” I teased. “Well. I figure you’re gonna need it considering who just walked in.” I squinted at Evie for a second but then my face fell. Crap. I knew without looking around that it was Britt. One, she always came around ten-thirty on Tuesdays. Two, she had an insanely loud voice that she showed off with pride. I stiffened as I waited for her to prance over and say hi, but luckily, I only heard her greeting whichever client she’d come to have a meeting with. “You’re safe for now,” Evie said under her breath. “Though I can feel her cattiness brewing.” It sounded like a typical Evie joke but I could honestly feel it too. Aside from the palpable heat of Britt’s eyes on the back of my head, I could see through the reflection in the raw bar that she kept looking my way. It was no surprise at all that she strutted over to our table the second she wrapped up her meeting. “Good morning, ladies,” she smiled, perching her butt on a stool in front of the raw bar. I usually saw her wearing sexy but work appropriate outfits to my restaurant, like skintight blouses and tiny pencil skirts, but today Britt had on a peach-colored sundress with the wide V-neck cut damned near down to her navel. I almost wanted to ask her where she bought her boob tape because it was a miracle that she’d yet to have a wardrobe malfunction. “Morning, Britt. Hitting the club soon?” Evie asked, wiggling her eyebrows at Britt’s dress. Britt looked down her front and waved a hand in the air. “Oh, this thing? No, no club for me, doll. I’m actually going to have a meeting with Emmett here in about twenty minutes.” Ah. Well, that explained that. I smiled at Britt, knowing well that she expected me to ask what she and Emmett were meeting about, but I didn’t feel like giving her the satisfaction of making me feel out of the loop. Besides, I could guess that it was probably for Emmett’s gala. “It’s for Emmett’s gala,” Britt said importantly. Yep. Exactly. “Ooh. What gala?” Evie cocked her head. I knew she was genuinely curious because she found Emmett’s wealth to be so very fascinating. “Why, Aly, that sounds very fancy,” she said, grinning at me. Britt cooed. “Oh, you’re so cute! Yes, I guess you could call it ‘fancy.’ It is black tie, so you’ll definitely have to save up a few paychecks for your dress, Aly,” she winked at me. Aaand there it is. The first dig. Evie and I had predicted it so the second we heard it, we glanced at each other and shared a satisfied smile – which was kind of twisted, but that was just us. “I mean we’re definitely going all out for this one,” Britt nodded, once again carrying the conversation all by herself. “The cause means a lot to him, as you know,” she nodded at me then quickly furrowed her brow. “Or maybe you don’t know. Do you know what the gala’s for this year?” When I didn’t answer right away, she smiled. “It’s for heart disease. Because his dad died of a heart attack when he was eighteen.” “Yes. I know that.” “Really? Were you at the funeral? Because I don’t think I saw you.” I couldn’t help my surprise. “You were at Uncle George’s funeral?” I blinked then caught myself. “I mean – George.” Britt’s eyes went wide. “Wow. Your families are so close you call his parents aunt and uncle?” I chewed my lip, knowing well that Britt was setting me up. Still, I answered, “Yes.” “Yikes. Then why didn’t you go to the funeral? Emmett was such a mess that day. It was so, so sad. I mean – to have your father and grandpa die within days of each other? So horrible.” I blinked. Wait. Holy shit. I didn’t even know that his grandfather died within days of his dad. What the fuck? Did I know and forget? Or did I just not know at all? A deep frown furrowed my brow, and guilt panged in my stomach as Britt went blithely on. “Poor thing. His life, his whole family – it was such a horrible mess,” she said, wearing an exaggerated pout. But in a snap, she perked right back up. “But hey, look at him now! Sexy, successful and sleeping with a new girl every week.” She tossed a wink at me. “Wonder what adventures next week will bring. Right?” Evie bristled. “Something tells me he might’ve just found a girl to stick with for awhile,” she said defensively as I kicked her under the table. “Oh, bless your heart. You don’t know about his ten-day rule then, do you?” Britt smirked. “Don’t worry. Just ask him – he’s pretty open about it.” “Totally. Will do,” Evie said with irritation, engaged in some fake-smile stare-off with Britt as my brain tried to catch up with everything she said. I had a feeling I’d normally be rattled by whatever ten-day rule Britt was talking about, but I was too busy stunned by what she said about Emmett’s dad and grandfather. I’d always assumed George Hoult Sr. had died of old age, but apparently, he’d died within days of his son. Then there was Britt’s claim that Emmett’s life had been a “horrible mess” for years after. Damn. My heart twisted at the thought of easy breezy Emmett going through suffering of that magnitude. His only worries back then were his three favorite things: football, friends and girls. I could hardly imagine what he was like in the face of hardship. But whether or not I could imagine it, it didn’t change the fact that it happened, and that Emmett had been through a world of pain since I was gone. He just didn’t show it. And I was an asshole for assuming his life was never anything but easy. “Oh, look!” Britt chirped. “Speak of the devil.” I heard the chime of the door swinging open and before even turning around, I watched Evie’s eyes and mouth pop open. “Holy fuck – hot, hot, hot!” she mouthed furiously before I turned around and felt my breath hitch in my throat. Because not only did Emmett look sinfully good in a plain white tee and blue jeans, just looking at him reminded me of everything we’d done last night. Maybe it was because he was wearing the shirt I’d slept in. But it was probably more to do with the fact that his blue eyes locked on me with such intensity I could feel a hot prickle dance over my skin. “Hey,” he grinned at me, the sound of his voice flooding me with a sense of ease. “Hey.” I’d set out a plan to be calm and cool when I saw him, but I couldn’t help the giant smile that spread my lips. “How… are you this morning?” I asked awkwardly, not knowing what else to say. We both somewhat snorted at my question before he gave an answer. “Great. Better than ever,” he said before Britt cut in. “Ibuprofen works wonders,” she said for reasons I didn’t completely understand. “Now that you’re feeling ‘better than ever,’ Emmett, are you ready to start our meeting?” she asked, innocently clasping her hands in a way that required her to push her cleavage together. Emmett looked at her then nodded at her table. “I’m early. I’ll meet you there soon,” he said, prompting her humph sound as she marched off. When he turned back around, he smiled at Evie. “Sorry for being rude. I’m Emmett.” “Yes, Emmett Hoult. I’m Evie. I’ve heard all about you,” she said, putting true emphasis on the word “all” and earning another kick under the table. Emmett laughed. “Well, I hope it’s all good things.” “Mm, it’s been a mixed bag.” “Okay, Evie,” I interrupted before turning back to Emmett with a shy smile. “Hey,” I murmured. “What’s up?” “Wanna order sushi and watch the Empires game tonight?” he asked. “Oh.” My eyes fluttered. I hadn’t expected him to reply with a full-on plan, but I guess it didn’t sound half bad. “Yeah. Okay,” I said brightly to hide the fact that I wasn’t particularly jazzed about these plans. “That sounds like… a nice, relaxing night.” He smiled. “Sure. Well, I’ll let you work then,” he said, giving Evie a goodbye nod before turning back to me. “See you back home.” “See you,” I said slowly, trying but failing to think of something better to end our conversation on. I mean the conversation we had was technically fine, but I couldn’t help the sudden knots in my stomach. “What?” Evie frowned, easily reading my expression. I shook my head to wave it off but eventually caved. “Was that weird just now?” “Was what weird?” I wiggled my lips. I didn’t want to admit it but I was suddenly worried by how casual Emmett was. I’d been just about losing my mind over him all morning. It felt like I’d become a new person – that everything in my world was about to be different. I was so sure that what happened between Emmett and me last night was turn-your-life-upside-down crazy, but apparently, I was alone in feeling that way. Maybe I’d just over read things. The thought crossed my mind just as Evie arched an eyebrow. “Aly…? Still waiting.” “Oh! It’s nothing. I mean I know this is gonna sound stupid,” I whispered hastily. “But I just thought he’d have… more to say to me?” I cringed at myself as I shrugged. “And be more excited to see me? Oh God, I sound like an idiot.” “Stop it,” Evie scolded. “You don’t sound like an idiot. You’re just over-thinking things because you like him.”
 I wrinkled my nose. My instinct was to deny it but there was no point anymore. I liked Emmett Hoult – to the point that I was getting irrationally jealous that he was sitting with Britt right now and not me. Good Lord. “He was totally excited to see you before. Don’t hold it against him that he didn’t have an over-the-top reaction. Boys are just like that,” Evie said. “I mean Mike definitely is,” she muttered before pursing her lips for a second and frowning at me. “Was it what Britt just said? About some ten-day rule?” “No,” I said emphatically, though I wasn’t sure if I was telling the truth. “Are you upset because you were expecting him to want to do something bigger than delivery and TV? Like, were you expecting a more formal date?” I blinked. “I don’t think so.” But now that you mention it, kind of. Evie wiggled her lips. “I don’t know, Aly… I guess it’s just hard to follow a night like last night. You know?” She shrugged. “Maybe he’s tired. I mean the man did work last night. He pounded two orgasms outta you. I’m sure that’s no easy feat.” Teddy cleared his throat at the raw bar. “Okay, for the most part, I agree with you, but ya gotta stop,” I whispered, though I did manage to laugh at my best friend. “We’re gonna get sued for sexual harassment, so let’s just… stop talking completely for a bit.” “And what? Listen to Britt fawn all over Emmett like a frickin’ cornball?” Evie made a face. I paused as we both took a second to easily eavesdrop on their meeting. “Emmett, you know I’m going to be dressed to the nines for this party. I’m gonna look so good you’re gonna have to help me swat the men away.” One line from her and we looked at each other and closed our laptops. “You wanna work in the office?” Evie asked. I nodded. “Yeah. Let’s do it.”            21  ALY    By the time I got home that evening, I was slightly less rattled and on edge as I’d been all morning. The lunch rush helped. Joking around with Evie helped, and so did the fact that we each had a glass of wine toward the end of the shift. Maybe that was what had me moving so slowly as I tried to find the right key to the door. It felt like awhile since I’d done it, and I kept putting in the wrong one. But thankfully, after ten seconds of struggling, Emmett opened it from inside for me. “Hey. Right on time.” “Actually, I’m super late – there was some receipt drama at closing.” Emmett blinked over at the clock, making a face that said oh damn when he realized I was in fact home much later than promised. But with that easy shrug of his, he simply nodded out the door. “All good. We’ll just leave now to make up for it.” I blinked. “Wait – leave now? I thought we were doing delivery and the game.” “Did I say delivery?” Emmett asked, smirking in a way that made me suddenly frown and play back our conversation from the morning. “I… think, yes? I mean you said sushi...” “Right. And I already ordered some from my favorite spot in the city. It’ll be waiting for us at my suite,” he said, watching me very slowly cock my head in confusion. “At the stadium,” Emmett clarified, laughing at the way I blinked twice before reacting with a stunned look on my face. “Wait. We’re… going to the city?” I froze. “To watch the game at Empire Stadium?” Emmett hit me with that sexy grin and said, “Yeah,” while casually strolling out the door I was still standing in. Flabbergasted, my hand still gripping the doorknob, I turned and watched his gorgeously muscled backside amble down the steps. When I didn’t follow, he peered over his shoulder and confused as I was, I couldn’t help noting how handsome he was. He looked fucking irresistible turned fully around, hands in his pockets as he chuckled and asked, “What?” “I – I don’t know.” I really didn’t. “It’s just… the city’s more than two hours away. Isn’t it? The game will be over by the time we get there.” “It would be if we were taking a car, wouldn’t it?” Emmett asked as he nodded toward his truck with amusement. “Now come on. I gotta get us to our ride.” * * * A helicopter. Our ride to the city was a fucking helicopter. I didn’t even try to act remotely calm or composed as I skipped across the helipad toward our extremely loud but incredibly shiny, all-black ride. Holy fuck, holy fuck. Is this really happening? I had to ask myself the question over and over. I was used to taking the Hampton Jitney anytime I wanted to go into the city, but I generally limited my trips because coughing up nearly fifty bucks for a one-way ride kind of sucked. So considering even the bus was a luxury to me, this was freaking amazing. Unreal, really. “How is this your life?” I shouted over the sound of the blade slapping well over our heads. “What?” “Never mind!” I didn’t bother asking any more stupid questions once we got in. I had better things to do anyway, like watch us lift off the ground and take in the views of the water. It was just a forty-minute ride, and it felt even shorter because I was so busy staring out the window and taking pictures the whole time. I was so stunned I didn’t even pay much mind to the fact that Emmett was taking pictures of me taking pictures. Back in the day, I hated every time he found me so thoroughly amusing. But this was fine. I didn’t have the capacity to cop any sort of attitude with him, even if it was a joking one. I was just too blown away. “Oh my God. I forgot there was more,” I laughed at myself after we landed and got into a car to take us to Empire Stadium. I was still coming down from the exhilaration of seeing the city from the sky. The aerial view was so beautiful that it made me miss home for the first time in awhile. I’d spent the first sixteen years of my life in Manhattan and Brooklyn, but then I spent the next ten everywhere else. After everything that happened, I was happy to live literally anywhere but New York. It wasn’t till four years ago that I came back, working my ass off at a million jobs to save money before finally moving to Sag Harbor, where Evie lived with Mike. “Aly.” Emmett’s voice brought me back to reality, and when I turned to face him, I found his eyes on me, and his hand reaching for mine. “Can I steal you from the window for a sec?” he asked, wearing the most adorably exhausted look on his face. “Sure. You okay?” “Yeah, I’ve just been waiting to put my hands all over you since I woke up this morning, and I don’t think I can last any longer.” My lashes fluttered and I let out the breathiest “oh” to ever come out of my mouth. I chewed hard on my lip as I took his hand, because I could feel the biggest, dopiest smile twitching at the corners of my mouth. I did my best to contain it but it broke free when Emmett pulled me swiftly onto his lap, locking his crystal blue eyes on mine. “Hey,” he grinned, melting me on the spot. “Hi.” “Waiting for you to come home today was the longest eight hours of my life.” Lord. His blunt honesty was so fucking cute I had to look down to laugh. I couldn’t let Emmett see me looking this happy and relieved. I was afraid of giving away the fact that I’d been racking my brain over him all day, anxiously over-reading our every interaction or lack thereof since being together in bed together last night. I had really convinced myself that he was feeling just meh about me – that his fascination had waned shortly after we finished having sex. I thought delivery and the game meant that Emmett was ready to calm things down and start tempering my expectations. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. “Yeah, I pretty much thought about you all day too,” I laughed sheepishly, smoothing my hands over his broad chest as he ran his up and down my thighs. I shook my head at him when I felt his cock stiffen underneath me. “Really?” I teased. “If you think that’s anything I can help around you, then you still don’t know how fucking crazy you make me,” Emmett said, putting butterflies in my stomach. “You have no idea how much it hurt to have my meeting at your place today and have to keep my hands to myself.” “Is that why you barely said bye when you left?” “Yeah. That and Britt was just asking me a million questions about you, and I felt like I had to get her out of there,” Emmett laughed, rushing the last few words of his sentence so he could grab two handfuls of my ass and groan. “Christ. I can’t stand not touching you, but touching you makes me want to rip all your fucking clothes off,” he muttered in frustration, his eyes devouring my body before he peered past my shoulders at our driver. The car was a particularly large SUV, and there was a row of seats separating us from him, but as wet as he had me in about two seconds flat, I couldn’t have sex with someone else in the car. “Easy,” I smirked. “Let me help you cool down with a question I just need to get off my chest.” “Uh-oh. What?” “What’s this ten-day rule Britt Heatherton told me about?” I asked. “Is it real?” Emmett raised his eyebrows but laughed. “Uh… yeah. It is.” He looked unperturbed as he eyed my reaction. “Of course, you should know by now that you’re the exception to any rule I’ve ever made for myself.” I tried to control another dorky grin. “Really.” “Really.” “And what other rules of yours have I broken? Because I have to be honest, you don’t really seem like a rules kind of guy,” I teased. “Fair enough. I’m not. But the few that I have, I’ve already broken for you.” “Ten-day thing aside, what else is there?” “The roommate thing,” Emmett replied. “I told myself when I was probably twenty years old that I’d never live with someone again. My roommate in college… his name was Cam and he was such a slob. He’d leave food everywhere and hook up with girls in my bed, so pretty much since him, I’ve been flying solo.” Emmett grinned. “Unless you count my boy.” “Ozzy? I think he’s mad at me, by the way.” “Nah. He just likes the option of being able to sleep on my bed if he wants. He’s spoiled. But he’ll get used
 to you.” “I see,” I nodded, trying not to beam over Emmett’s words. But it was hard. Saying that Ozzy needed to get used to me was another confirmation that he really did see me sticking around. And I knew I shouldn’t be completely surprised over that because between us, Emmett and I had a unique bond and a lot of history. So if he did want to venture into relationships with someone, narcissistic as it might sound, I could kind of understand why it’d be me. But at the same time, my brain was anxiously trying to find things to worry about. It was convinced that this was entirely too good to be true, and that some way somehow, there had to be a catch. Thankfully, it was hard to linger on those thoughts when Emmett was still pulsing under me, swelling harder and harder as his lips drifted along my collarbones, over the tops of my breasts. “Emmett,” I warned, my jaw dropping when he tugged at the neckline of my T-shirt till my breasts popped out. “Emmett!” “Sorry. Might be addicted to these.” “I can tell,” I giggled, my voice breathy and nervous as I peered over my shoulder at our driver. I was still peering out the dash when I felt Emmett pull down the cups of my bra and flick his tongue over my nipple. “Oh God, what are you doing to me?” “This is what you get,” he grinned. “For every time you walked around the house without a bra on, I dreamt of doing this,” he muttered, swirling his tongue around me. I suppressed a moan. “But I usually wore a bra around the house,” I defended myself in a whisper. “Usually. But the times you didn’t…” “You could tell?” “Yes. From the shape. The way you bounced. I think you gave me a new fetish,” Emmett smirked, pushing my breasts together and licking them like an ice cream cone. Holy shit. My instinct was to protest but I couldn’t anymore. His shamelessness had me way too turned on and it felt too good for me to say a word. “The night we watched that movie… these were so fucking hard I just wanted to rip your shirt off and suck on them all night,” Emmett muttered, pinching my nipple between his fingers and giving the tip a hot flick with his tongue. I gasped as sensation rocketed straight to my pussy. Shit. Apparently, my nipples were now hardwired to my clit. Suddenly, it felt like every nerve ending in my body existed in just those tight little peaks, and it made the next words from his mouth infinitely hotter. “Have you ever come from having your nipples sucked?” It took me a second to answer. “The only time I almost did was with you. The night after the club.” Emmett’s blue eyes peered up at me. “Almost?” he repeated as if I’d just challenged him. Then without saying another word, he went to work, devoting the rest of the car ride to pinching, nipping and sucking on my nipples as his hands plumped my tits. I was delirious. We literally went from one borough to another without Emmett losing a second of interest, which I found insane. Never in my life had I thought that just one part of my body deserved this much attention, but now I was beyond convinced that every lady deserved a man who would dedicate this much time to just her nipples and literally nothing else. I’d never in my life felt this sensation before – this thrilling buzz rushing from my breasts to my pussy as Emmett continued to bathe me with the sopping wet heat of his tongue. The fact that he was enjoying himself so much just made it that much hotter. His little mmm’s and groans of pleasure made it sound like he was lapping at honey. His cock was so stiff under me as he pinched my nipples that I felt little bolts of pleasure darting quick between my thighs. When I came, it was nothing I’d ever felt before, and judging from his raspy chuckle, Emmett enjoyed every second of my flustered reaction. Unlike any other orgasm he’d given me – or any I’d ever had before in my life – this one washed over me gently, traveling my whole body before dissolving into a little tickle that made my mouth fall open. Holy. What. Whatever that was, I’d never felt anything like it before, and as he covered me back up, I stared in pure awe at Emmett. I couldn’t even be mad that he looked so amused by me because what in the actual fuck was that? “Um.” I took another minute before I could gather my words. “So… wow. Definitely my first nipplegasm,” I murmured close to Emmett’s smile, pressing a soft kiss against his lips and sweeping my tongue through his mouth in gratitude. He ran his palms down the curve of my ass, squeezing here and there until finally pulling away with a groan. My eye widened when he lifted me off his lap because never had I seen such a clear-as-day outline of a cock through a pair of pants. His thick shaft was snaked down the leg of his jeans, and his pulsing tip looked like a fist that was ready to punch right through denim. “Oh God, Emmett, I tortured you,” I whispered, holding his face in my hands and trying not to laugh despite the grin on his face. “It’s not complete torture if I got to make you come,” he smirked, though he groaned when I kissed him and pulled away. “Yeah, don’t do that. yet. I, uh… I just need a minute.” “Omigod. Okay.” Poor guy. He’d given himself blue balls just to get me quietly off in the back of this car, and as weird as it sounded, I was pretty sure I’d never in my relationship history been on the receiving end of an act so selfless or romantic. And from Emmett Hoult of all people. Suddenly, I was hit with the intense need to pay him back. Fuck the no sex in cars rule – he was just as much my exception as I was his. But right on cue, just as I began kissing him again, we pulled up into the team parking lot.            22  EMMETT    There was always an obligatory rush of greetings I had to give and receive every time I walked into Empire Stadium. Between Julian and me, I was by far the friendlier, less scary Hoult, so it made sense that people came to talk to me more. From members of the front office to guys from the grounds crew, I had dozens of people I always caught up with before getting to my seat. I usually loved it too. But not so much today. Today, I just wanted to be with Aly. I just wanted to get her alone so I could kiss, touch and hold her however the hell I wanted, but as we walked down the hall, we kept getting stopped. I could feel Aly practically beaming up at me as I put on a good face and chatted with everyone, but even her smile wasn’t enough comfort for the fact that I couldn’t put my hands all over her already. By the time we got to my suite, my body was rigid from head to toe. And to make matters worse, I opened the door to find Julian in there with Sara. I let out a groan at the ceiling. “Fucking hell. What are you doing here?” “I own the stadium, asshole. Good to see you too,” Julian smirked before spotting Aly behind me. I noticed the slightest twitch in his brow, which was as much surprise or expression as anyone not named Sara would ever get out of him. “Aly,” he said with a genuine smile. “Christ, it’s been forever. I take it Emmett’s been tolerable if you’re choosing to join him this evening.” “Yes, he has. Hi Julian,” Aly laughed, hugging Julian. While they caught up, I turned to say hello to Sara. Her dark ponytail was swinging around as she bounced on her heels, waiting to embrace me. I was about to ask what she looked so giddy for but then she threw her arms around me, going on her tiptoes to hiss next to my ear. “I’m pregnant!” I pulled back with wide eyes. “No fucking way,” I whispered as she mouthed don’t tell him. “I’m sorry, I just had to get it out,” Sara said in an excited rush just as Julian’s attention returned to us. He pulled his eyebrows tight. “What?” “Nothing,” Sara and I replied in unison. Julian’s laugh was curt. “Yeah?” His eyes flicked back and forth between us for a few seconds. “You two literally couldn’t be more suspicious right now.” “You couldn’t be more suspicious right now. Now get out of my suite, I’m here with my woman.” “Your woman?” Julian repeated as Sara’s face lit up. Ah. Shit, I cursed to myself but grinned when I caught Aly’s slightly stunned smile. It was half slip of tongue, half me trying to get rid of Julian, but before I knew what was happening, Sara was excitedly introducing herself to Aly as Julian pulled me sharply aside. “Are you serious, Emmett? This is everything I told you not to do.” he said, looking less amused with me than usual. I shoved my hands in my pockets and shrugged. “I don’t know man,” I laughed. “Let me live.” “How did this happen?” “It just did, can’t explain it. Hey, how are you and Sara, by the way? Anything new?” Julian paused to eye me. He had a perfect record when it came to staying on topic while I actively tried to change the subject. But today, for the first time ever, he caved. His chest expanded as he inhaled deep and clenched his jaw. “Did she say something to you?” he asked. “No. What would she say if she said something?” Julian stared at me for two hard seconds. He dragged his hand across his face to hide the giant grin he broke into for half a second before containing himself. “Fuck,” he hissed under his breath before glancing over his shoulder at Sara then back at me. He bounced exactly once on his heels before lowering his voice. “I think she’s pregnant. But she hasn’t said anything yet, and I don’t want to get my hopes up.” I suppressed a massive smile. My stomach was somersaulting with excitement but I did my best to hold it in. I could easily take my own secrets to the grave, but I had a history of spilling the beans when it came to Julian and Sara, so I refused to let myself fuck this up. “I don’t know, man. If she is, she is. If she’s not, she’s not. But it would definitely be cool for Ozzy to have a cousin.” Julian snorted. “Right. I guess I should temper my kid’s expectations of ever having a human cousin. Sara has no siblings and you… are who you are.” “I’m not entirely sure what
 you mean by that but I do think I’m offended.” Julian laughed. “You realize you can’t let Mom find out about anything going on between you and Aly, right? She’s going to get so ahead of herself she’ll probably have to be hospitalized for heartbreak if and when you two break up.” “Jesus fuck, take it easy. And Aly isn’t going anywhere, alright? I promise you that.” Julian studied me. I expected him to launch into a speech about how I’d lost credibility after introducing a hundred different girls to my family, none of which ever lasted more than a week-and-a-half. But he surprised me by going in a different direction. “I know how much she’s always meant to you,” he said, giving me a nod of acknowledgment. It was the first time my brother had given me credit for anything regarding a girl, and it actually felt kind of nice. “I mean you definitely had a shitty way of showing it then, but here’s to hoping that you can make up for it now.” I raised my eyebrows. “That was actually really nice for your standards,” I said as he grinned. “Yeah, well. Like you said, I’m getting soft.” “Definitely. On that topic, remind me that I owe Sara a million beers for making you that much more tolerable since you’ve been together.” “Yeah, I’ll remind you in nine months, hopefully.” I chewed both lips back, making probably the stupidest face in the world as I tried not to let anything slip. I’d kept Sara’s secret for all of eight minutes but it felt like a tornado pummeling inside me. The second they were gone, I had to let it out. “Julian’s going to be a dad,” I blurted, my hands thrust in my hair. I broke into a huge grin as Aly gasped. “Oh my God. Your mom’s going to freak out!” I laughed because she was completely right about that. “Holy shit,” I murmured to myself as I floated over to a chair. Aly tried to sit in the one next to me but I caught her by the hips and pulled her onto my lap, sitting her sideways so I could see her face. I didn’t even care that she was laughing at me. I needed to hold her while I processed this. It was honestly bigger news to me than when Julian bought the Empires. Way bigger. “Man. He needed this,” I finally said, grinning progressively wider as I nodded to myself. “He really did. He’s been waiting to be a dad for a long time.” “Seriously?” Aly giggled. “I mean I remember him always being good with kids, but I also remember him saying that he was ‘a hundred percent never having children.’” I smirked at her completely accurate memory. “Yeah, well. I think he changed his mind after our dad died.” Aly’s face fell. “Oh.” She took my hand in both of hers, quiet for a second. “I guess that makes sense.” “Yeah,” I said, frowning as I remembered what Julian was like after my dad died. What my whole family was like. I was so lost in the memory that I didn’t register Aly tipping my face to hers till I was looking in her big eyes. “What?” I murmured. “I feel bad,” she said straightaway. “For what?” “For not being there when your dad died. For not knowing your grandpa died right after.” I winced when she mentioned Grandpa. He had cancer so we were all prepared for his death. The one we weren’t expecting was Dad. From what we knew, he was perfectly healthy. If anything, he was just stressed about his siblings fighting over Grandpa’s will. It was during this time – all these nights that our family spent in hospice with Grandpa – that Dad would pull me aside and talk about Aly’s father. “This is why I’m grateful for Charlie Stanton,” he’d say. “He’s visited Grandpa more than your aunts and uncles have. He sends flowers. He’s been here for me the way my real brothers and sisters haven’t been, and that’s why you, me – all the Hoults will treat him like blood. Always. No matter what.” It was conflicting to hear. In my heart, I knew something was off about Aly’s dad, but at the same time, it was hard to defy my father. He was the smartest man I knew, in terms of business, love and family. The love he had for my mother was the goal I’d set for my own life. Unless I found someone I wanted to love the way Dad loved Mom, then I hadn’t found anyone yet. “Honestly, I think I learned what family was from yours more than mine,” Aly murmured, gazing down at our entwined fingers. “In some ways, I can’t blame my dad for idolizing your family so much. You guys were perfect.” “Until we weren’t.” Aly paused and looked up at me just in time to catch the grimace on my face. “I know something happened after your dad passed… but I don’t know what it was, and I feel horrible asking.” I shook my head. “Don’t. We weren’t exactly open about it. It was a fucked up time. It wasn’t the way Mom wanted people to see us.” “What do you mean?” “Dad died after a fight with Julian,” I said, my heart beating fast as the words came out. I forced myself to peer up at the look of pure shock on Aly’s face. “Nobody knows about this. Most people think Julian went away because he was depressed. They definitely didn’t think it was because Mom blamed him for Dad’s death.” “I remember my mom mentioning that Julian took a job overseas at one point,” Aly said, her gaze drifting off as she dug through her own memories. “I remember her saying how smart he was. For getting a change of scenery to help get over things. She said she’d always wanted to go to Sweden. That’s where he went, right?” “Yeah. Everyone spins everything we do into something cool or glamorous,” I laughed, though it was more annoying than funny. “But the truth was that for a good five years after Dad died, we were barely a family anymore. None of us were talking for awhile. Not to Julian at least.” Aly’s eyes flew wide open. “Not even you? But you guys were always so close.” “Well, he was far away. And while he was gone, he made some decisions that made us feel like he was going to stay away for good. And Mom wasn’t doing well. Gram wasn’t either. They’d both lost their husbands in one week, so they were my priority. Not Julian,” I shrugged, putting on a casual face despite the pain twisting under my ribs. I’d gotten good at that. “So it was all on you?” Aly’s eyes were a little wet as she looked up at me. “You were eighteen years old and everyone’s rock?” I nodded. The story wasn’t even as simple as this, but I couldn’t get into it any further, so I gave another shrug and smiled. “That’s why I’m excited to start building on the family again. We all needed this,” I said, relieved to see the happy little curl touch Aly’s lips. “You’re going to be an uncle,” she said, breaking into such a big grin I had to follow suit. “Fun Uncle Emmett. That’s got a nice ring to it.” “Definitely,” I laughed just as the crack of a bat sounded, drawing both our eyes to a home run on the field. And for the rest of the evening, we watched the game, Aly leaning her head against mine as she popped kettle corn in her mouth. I leaned back in my chair, swigging my beer, both of us fully relaxed as the Empires coasted into their fifth win in a row. At the final out, Aly looked up at me, saying thank you before grabbing my shoulders and hoisting herself up to kiss my forehead then my lips. It felt so fucking good. Strange, but good. Because while we were sitting in the stadium we grew up in, we were somehow in a completely different place.            23  ALY    I couldn’t say no to seeing Emmett’s apartment after the game. I had work in seven hours, and we still had a commute back to the Hamptons, but I couldn’t resist. I was suddenly in a place where I wanted to know everything I could about Emmett. It was definitely a hell of a one-eighty since a few weeks ago. Instead of bitter now, I was more so amazed by Emmett, and appreciative of him in a way I’d never been in my life. I could feel that it made me happier, too. Even lighter – as if this whole time, I’d been dragged down by the weight of the grudge I constantly held in my heart. I had always been certain that I never let it affect me day-to-day, but now I wasn’t so sure – especially since now, there was an actual skip in my step as I waltzed out of the elevator and into Emmett’s beautiful loft. “Holy shit,” I said, my gaze instantly drawn to the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking downtown Manhattan. I felt the breath hitch in my throat as I drifted over to the glittering view, exhaling when I felt Emmett come up behind me and wrap his strong arms around my waist. “We can stay here tonight if you want. Julian’s already back in the Hamptons, so I’ll have him take Ozzy for the night. And then I’ll get up early with you so we can head back to the Hamptons together.” When I turned around with my brow arched in question, he laughed. “In the helicopter. Yes.” I bit my sheepish grin. God, it all sounded so amazing but I still couldn’t bring myself to pull the trigger. “I don’t know. I obviously want to but I have to get to work early tomorrow to take care of this stupid thing.” “What stupid thing?” “My liquor license. It’s about to expire and the new application got delayed, so I need to take care of that before we have to shut down our booze program. The brunch people would pretty much lose their minds if they couldn’t order their Bloody Mary’s,” I said, getting stressed out just thinking about it. “Hey. Easy.” He wasn’t even facing me, but Emmett could feel my tension. He buried his lips in my hair as he held my tighter. “I know people at the liquor authority. I can just make a call and push it through,” he said, grinning when I turned to give him a stunned look. “Are you serious?” “Yeah. Sound good?” he asked, cocking his head as I chewed my lip. “Why even hesitate about this if it makes your life easier?” “I don’t know. Because I’m not used to getting things so easy. It makes me feel guilty. Like I didn’t earn it.” “You’ve busted your ass for everything in your life so far,” Emmett said with a gentle laugh. “So cash in on my luck for once. You know you deserve it. Especially
 if it means we get to spend the night here instead of heading back now,” he murmured, brushing my hair back. “It’s just so late already and I want us to be able to relax for a bit before bed.” A little smile wiggled onto my lips. I wasn’t sure which part of his sentence gave me butterflies. It might’ve been the word “relax” or the word “us” – I wasn’t sure, but whatever it was, it had me suddenly caving. “Okay,” I nodded, my heart fluttering as he exhaled and grinned. “Let’s do it then. Let’s just stay here tonight.” * * * There was something distinctly more intimate about being at Emmett’s apartment in the city. For starters, it was his actual home – the place he spent most of his year – and it showed. It was sleek and sexy, but unlike the Hamptons house, it was thoroughly lived in. As he he opened a bottle of wine, I wandered around, noting the shoes by the door and the little stacks of mail on the kitchen counter. Surprisingly, there was also an office with piles of folders and papers on the desk, but after a second-long glance inside, Emmett came up behind me and shut the door. “Don’t look in there. It’s a mess.” “Really? That’s a mess to you these days?” I laughed as he handed me a glass of white. He had changed into my favorite outfit on him – sweats. And just sweats. Especially these sweats. They were worn in and hung low on that sculpted V of his hipbones, giving me such a long, full view of his drool-worthy torso that I legitimately forgot what I was saying. “I don’t know how to talk anymore,” I said bluntly, making him laugh. “You were expressing surprise for the fact that I’m not a teenaged slob anymore,” Emmett smirked as I followed him into the living room. “Oh yeah! Oh God, you used to shed your shoes and socks while going up the stairs and leave like, a trail of your clothes down the hall. I also remember never being able to see more than a few inches of floor in your room.” “Well, we’ve established that I’ve changed a pretty good amount since high school,” Emmett snorted. “Plus, living in the same building as Julian means him dropping by unannounced all the time, which means I gotta keep this place looking good.” “Oh, and you’re going to have to start baby-proofing a couple rooms too,” I couldn’t help but coo, especially as I watched the realization hit Emmett in the form of two blinks then a giant grin. God, his excitement over this baby was way too cute. It was definitely doing something to my ovaries. “Yeah. Man. We definitely got a lot to do,” he said, his blue eyes gleaming as we nestled into the couch. “I wonder if it’s a boy or a girl,” he murmured, staring out at nothing. “Do you have a preference?” I asked as I studied his gorgeous profile. Shoot. I didn’t know what it was, but my hormones were in overdrive and forcing me to imagine his blue eyes and perfect cheekbones on a child of mine. Jesus, Aly. Dial it back, I told myself. But it was hard when he was still glowing about the prospect of his niece or nephew. “I know Julian wants a girl,” he said. “So I’m gonna root for a girl, too. But either way, it’s going to be awesome to have a baby Hoult around.” “Mm-hm. Fun uncle’s gonna be a pretty natural role for you,” I giggled. “Definitely,” he said as he pulled my legs onto his lap, kissing me as I ran my fingers along the ridges of his eight-pack. “Though it kind of sucks that my kids won’t have their own fun uncle,” he said, laughing when I pulled away to flash a quizzical look. “Because Julian’s so serious,” he explained. My eyes fluttered. “No, yeah, I got that. I think I was just… surprised that you wanted kids,” I realized aloud. And suddenly it was my turn to explain myself. “Because you’re so against relationships?” Emmett’s eyebrows pulled tight. “I’m not,” he said so easily I got even more confused. “But you won’t let yourself have one. Not after that one girlfriend in college,” I said quietly, fearful that I was treading onto a sensitive subject. But the quieter it made Emmett, the more curious it made me. Who was she? What did she do to you? I was so desperate to ask those questions, but I didn’t want to obliterate the moment, so I just waited for Emmett to speak. “I didn’t let myself commit to anyone because I didn’t think I could,” he finally said, his words measured. “Even if I wanted to, I had… reasons for why I’d have to up and leave out of nowhere. And that wouldn’t be fair to her.” What? I felt lost as I stared into my wine glass, trying to figure out the puzzle of his words. But I couldn’t, and as Emmett went on, I only got more confused. “I made that whole ten-day rule so I wouldn’t be tempted to get attached to anyone. I know it happens when you’ve been with someone long enough, and I didn’t want to risk,” he said before tipping my chin up so I looked him in the eye. “What’s that face, Aly?” he asked softly. I swallowed. “I don’t know. I guess I don’t like hearing about your no relationships rule.” “Fair. But like I said before, you’ve always been the exception to any one of my rules,” he murmured, making my heart skip a beat. “I don’t have a choice when it comes to being attached to you,” Emmett laughed softly. “I am and I’ve been. For as long as I can remember. You’re just a way of life for me that I don’t want to give up again.” I wet my lips. “What exactly are you saying?” I asked quietly. I had a suspicion but I didn’t want to get it wrong. Since last night, I’d felt like I was in a dream, and I could barely trust my own head, even if it sounded clearly like Emmett was asking me for a relationship. “I’m saying that I’ve been waiting twelve years for you, and I don’t want anyone else. I want to be with you, and only you,” he said, melting me right into the couch. I had no clue what mushy, girly reaction took over me, but it made Emmett laugh and pluck the wine glass from my hand, setting it safely on the table. “So you in?” he asked, looking like a vision from my dreams. Every muscle on his torso rippled as he angled towards me, grinning as he cupped my jaw and watched me nod. “Obviously,” I breathed out as he pressed the sweetest kiss to my lips. “I’m in.”            24  EMMETT    She wound up late the next morning because I couldn’t keep my hands off of her. It was impossible when she slept next to me the whole night in just my T-shirt and no panties. Apparently, I’d “destroyed” them last night by walking around shirtless, and my punishment was sleeping next to her naked pussy and trying to keep my dick down till morning. It was torture, and it was really no surprise that I pounced on her the second she woke up. If anything, the surprise came in the kitchen when I found her cooking me breakfast – still wearing only my T-shirt. Christ. I couldn’t stop thinking about the view of her ass each time she lifted her arms to get something from the cabinet. It made me groan out loud as I headed straight from Aly’s restaurant back to the helipad. I’d left the city an hour ago, but now I was headed right back for a 10AM appointment with Iain. Yeah, it would’ve made more sense for me to just stay in the city this morning, but I also couldn’t pass up the extra time with Aly. I couldn’t get enough of her. I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I was still thinking about her sweet laugh this morning when I walked into Iain’s office, and it was probably the only reason I didn’t immediately clock Drew in the head when I saw him. “Hey. I come in peace, alright?” he laughed since I was already shaking my head at him. “You’re a fuckin’ asshole, you know that?” I said just as Iain walked in holding a coffee. “Whoa, hey, what’s going on?” he asked, knocking Drew’s feet off his desk on his way to his chair. “Nothing. Emmett’s just pissed that I’m an exceptional wingman,” Drew said, wearing shit-eating grin of his. “Yeah? Is that what that was?” I snorted, leaning against the wall and kicking his feet down when he propped them up again. “Somehow I’m lost on how you kissing Aly is winging for me.” Iain coughed on his coffee before squinting at Drew. “You kissed his girl? The fuck is wrong with you?” Drew held his hands out. “What? It wasn’t real. There was no tongue. I was just doing it to piss off Emmett to piss off Beth. Because Beth pissed off Ellie. Does that make sense?” I rolled my eyes when Iain looked at me with confusion. “He didn’t get any of the names right,” I explained. “Ah.” “Whatever,” Drew smirked, leaning back in his chair and flipping his cap backwards on his head. “I maintain that I did a good thing there,” he said to me. “If it weren’t for me, you would’ve wasted your time on that platonic shit for who knows how long. And at some point, someone would’ve snatched her up, and you would’ve turned into a mopey little shit because you’ve pretty much wanted this girl since your balls dropped.” “What are you talking about?” Drew laughed. “Dude. Whether you realize it or not, you talked about this girl fucking constantly. Even before she came back into the picture. You never mentioned her by name but half your stories from childhood involved ‘that friend I grew up with,’ and you always referred to that friend as a she so I put two and two together.” “Wow,” Iain said as I stood there actually kind of impressed myself. “That’s right,” Drew said, looking smug. “I know you think you’re slick, Hoult, but you’re not. I mean I’m not the most detail-oriented guy, so if I noticed that you’re in love with this girl then you’re in love with her. And you shouldn’t have even wasted your time on the friends shit. End of story. Mic drop.” I rolled my eyes. “It was good until the last few words.” “Yeah. I’m gonna take that as a thank you, and to that I say fuck you. Now I’m the only bachelor left in the group.” I grinned, pretty happy to be on this side of the argument for once. “Yeah, well maybe if you stop chasing girls with a history of trespassing and stalking,” Iain muttered while doing
 ten things at once at his desk. “Hey, a lot of the crazy ones happen to be beautiful,” Drew shrugged as if it were out of his hands. “Yeah, well Emmett just scored him a beautiful, sane woman so stop making excuses and get out of my office,” Iain said, barely looking up from his work. “I have a meeting and you have physical therapy in an hour.” “Jesus. Fine,” Drew said, getting up. “What are you doing, E? Wanna get food?” “I’m Iain’s meeting,” I said, snorting when he rolled his head back and groaned at the ceiling. “But I owe you dinner for your non-traditional winging, alright? It’s going to take me a second to believe that you pulled that shit for noble purposes, but if you did, you did a damned good job,” I smirked. “Yeah, yeah. Probably gonna be my last night out with you before you get all wifed up,” Drew said, returning my laugh as he dragged his feet out the door. When he was finally gone, I heaved a sigh and sat across from Iain. “Nice client you’ve got,” I laughed. “Hey, I’m only associated to that prick through work. What’s your excuse?” Iain grinned before pulling up the profile on a new venture we’d been looking into. After turning the screen to me, he leaned back in his chair and fixed his cufflinks. “So you bringing Aly to the gala?” “Hopefully. I haven’t asked her yet.” “Why not?” “Haven’t really had the time. It’s kind of been a whirlwind.” “Well, how serious are you two?” I narrowed my eyes up at Iain. “Why are you grilling me?” “You know why,” he said, typing away on his phone. “I’m curious about whether or not you’ve told her about – ” “No,” I cut him off bluntly. “I haven’t. And I don’t plan on it either.” “Whoa.” He held a hand up. “That’s fine, Emmett. I’m just wondering so I know what I’m allowed to say around her when I see her at the gala,” he said, holding eye contact till he knew I’d relaxed a little. “What are you so tense about?” he asked. “You really don’t have anything to feel guilty about. What you did was ages ago. Well before you thought you’d ever see Aly again.” I nodded in agreement but I wasn’t completely convinced. I just didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t know how to word what bothered me anyway. All I knew was that I felt like I’d somewhat deceived Aly – that she maybe didn’t have reason to trust me completely. And after the past couple days, it was fucking tearing at me. “Trust me, Emmett. You’re good,” Iain said. He cracked a smile. “I mean if all the things Drew said before were true, then this is the one and only girl you’ve really cared about your whole life. So if she ever finds out about all the shit, I’m sure she’ll be able to look past it. Trust me on that?” “Yeah,” I lied just to get the meeting back on track. “Sure thing.”            25  EMMETT    My last meeting of the day was with the gala sponsors, and it wound up running so late that Aly texted just a big frown emoji that made me laugh in the middle of dinner.   ME: What’s the face for? ALY: Come home to me and Ozzy pleeease   I stared at the text. Fuck did it pull at my heartstrings. I chewed my grin as I reread it, pretty sure that a single sentence had never made me so happy and sad at the same time.   ME: Trust me there’s nothing I want more right now than to be with you two. I’m trying to get out here fast. What time are you going to sleep? ALY: Sometime after you come home : )   Following that text was a selfie of her on the couch with Ozzy on her lap, grinning at the camera like he was gloating. I smirked and shook my head. Goddammit. Just seeing the picture made my need to be home about a thousand times worse. I was honestly ready to just fake an emergency to get out of dinner. The meeting was technically over – this was just the part with the schmoozing that Julian was way better at. I wound up lasting another ten minutes before giving some excuse that sounded solid enough for everyone to nod along and say, “Go, go, go.” It was well past 9PM by now, but I still had a car ride from where I was on the Upper East Side down to the heliport on 34th Street. Then I had about a forty-minute flight to the Hamptons, and another fifteen minutes to the house. At one point in my life, this felt like nothing. This commute last summer was actually ideal because by the time I got back to the Hamptons, all my friends were already out, and I didn’t have to spend even a minute in my quiet house before hitting whatever lounge or club the crew was at. But now, things were different. Because now this commute home felt like a fucking eternity. By the time I got back it was midnight, and when I walked into the house, all I heard was the murmur of some movie turned way down low. I emptied my pockets quietly in the foyer, a little smile touching my mouth as I anticipated finding Aly asleep on the couch in a few seconds. And… yep. There she is. My grin spread wide when I walked into the living room to find Aly sleeping on the couch with her knees scrunched up to her chest. My guess was that she’d been making room for Ozzy before he hopped off the couch to go sleep on his favorite bed. Little prince, I snorted when I glanced at my boy lying completely stretched out with his legs hanging off the oak frame and velvet cushion chaise that Mom bought him. I laughed to myself and for a second, I did what I’d pretty much never done before in my life: I enjoyed the peace and quiet. I normally hated when things were still and silent. Whether it was at home, at dinner or a game, I usually preferred to be surrounded by people. But as I gazed at Aly on the couch, I found myself pretty quickly understanding why Julian always preached about quality over quantity. “Emmett?” Aly’s voice was breathy when she blinked her sleepy eyes open. “Shit. I’m sorry,” I said, tossing aside the squeaky toy I stepped on while walking over to her. I felt everything in my body stir as Aly stretched out on the couch, pushing her tits against her T-shirt as she arched her back tight. She let out a soft mmm as I ran my hand up the back of her leg before climbing on top of her, kissing up her neck as she asked me about my day. “Mm. Sounds like a long day,” she said groggily. Her eyes were still partially closed as she stretched and squirmed underneath me, getting me hard as a rock without even trying. “It was pretty long. But it felt longer because I was away from you,” I said, my breaths getting heavy as I watched Aly grind sleepily against my dick. I grinned. It was so fucking cute and sexy. It was like she couldn’t pass up on taking care of my hard-on, even if she was half-asleep. “Listen, I’ve been meaning to ask you something,” I murmured, grinning when she blinked her eyes open a little more, giving me her full attention – rather, as much as she could at this hour. “What’s up?” Aly asked, circling her arms around my neck. “I was wondering if you’d be my date for the gala next week,” I said, smirking when her eyebrow went up. “Why do you seem surprised to hear me ask that?” “I don’t know. Because I’m sleepy and I have trouble hiding my reactions when I’m sleepy,” she giggled softly. “And I guess because it’s just… such a big, important thing for you. Full of fancy people. I just thought you might not want to bring me as a date. ‘Cause then you’ll have to introduce me to everyone.” “Yeah. Exactly.” Aly smiled. “You want to introduce me to everyone?” she asked. “As your… you know?” “Girlfriend?” I laughed, watching her cheeks flush pink at just the sound of the word. “Yeah, Aly. I do.” “So I can call you my…” “Boyfriend? Jesus Christ. Yes,” I said, pretending to be impatient with her. But even the act of it didn’t last long because she looked so fucking adorable beaming and blushing underneath me. And for the next ten minutes or so, she let me just hold her and kiss her. We honestly wouldn’t have stopped if she didn’t suddenly gasp. I blinked at her wide-eyed look. “Aly. What?” “I don’t have anything to wear,” she blurted. “Huh?” “To your gala. If it’s black tie, I definitely don’t have anything appropriate to wear.” I chuckled at the frantic look on her face. “So? Then I’ll just have to take you shopping tomorrow,” I said, watching her big eyes crinkle slowly into a smile. “No. Don’t do that, Emmett…” “Why not?” “I don’t have the money to pay you back for a nice dress,” she frowned. I squinted at her. “Have you never had a boyfriend buy you gifts before?” “I… have. But small things,” she said in a small voice. “Not big things. Or expensive things.” “Yeah, well, we’ve already established that your exes were idiots, so let’s make this the last time you compare me to them ever again, alright?” I laughed, eventually making her laugh too. “Fine,” she said, her fingers playing with my hair as she looked me in the eyes. “It’s no contest anyway,” she added in a whisper before kissing me. Fuck. This woman. Every word out of her mouth had me even more hooked than before. She didn’t even know it, but she was addicting me to her so hard so fast that all I could think of was the next thing I wanted to do with her, the next thing I wanted to see with her. All I wanted was to see and hear every little smile and laugh that she had in her. Just that was enough to make me feel full – complete in a way I never thought I could feel. Shit. I shook my head as I pulled back to look into Aly’s gorgeous eyes. If this was what it meant to get soft, then as usual, Julian was onto something.            26  ALY    My entire staff hawked me with big, dopey grins when Emmett came to pick me up after work the next evening. He arrived a little prior to closing to grab a bite before our shopping trip, and since he sat at the raw bar, he chatted up Teddy, miraculously getting the poor kid to come out of his shell for literally the first time all summer. “Poor Teddy. I don’t think he even knew how much this estrogen-fest of a restaurant was affecting him,” Evie snorted as she and I hung
 out with Hannah by the espresso machine. “Yeah, he just needed a boy to talk to,” I giggled as Hannah finished making three macchiatos for us to sip on. “Yeah, that’s not a boy though. That’s a man. That’s like, the Merriam-Webster definition of a man.” “Really? So if I look in the dictionary, there’ll be a picture of Aly’s boyfriend?” Evie asked Hannah as I grinned awkwardly, trying to act unfazed by the word “boyfriend.” Yeah. Totally. So used to it, I nodded to myself. I figured I’d try to fake it till I made it because I definitely didn’t want to go to Emmett’s fancy gala and blush every time he introduced me to someone. I knew well that I’d already feel out of my league and nervous there, so getting used to the whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing would give me one less thing to fret about. “Hey. So I have good news and bad news,” Evie said later when we were doing the closeout paperwork in the office. “Hit me with the bad news first,” I said. “Got it,” Evie nodded, rearranging her desk in a million unnecessary ways because that was what she did when she was trying to play off being nervous. “Evie,” I snorted. “I already know that they canceled their reservation for Sunday. Hannah told me when I came in.” Evie blinked. “Oh.” She stared at me. “And you’re not upset?” I chewed on my lip, unsure of how to answer the question. I was upset that Dad had backed out of his fourth promise to visit the restaurant, but by now, I wasn’t really surprised. Looking up at Evie, I gave a shrug. “I honestly knew this was going to happen the day my mom called and said ‘book that day, we’re coming.’ She wants to make it happen, but he doesn’t, and in the end she’ll always yield to him,” I said, making Evie furrow her brow. “But don’t be upset. I’m… slightly more at peace about this whole thing now.” “Because of Emmett?” “Maybe,” I admitted. “I just feel a little clearer in my head, if that makes sense. And I feel happy now in a way I don’t think I’ve… ever been? In my whole life?” I said unsurely, with a nervous laugh. “And it makes me kind of anxious because I feel like there’s gotta be a catch. But it feels way too good for me to stop, so I guess I’m just gonna ride the high till the other shoe drops.” Evie gave me a funny face. I could tell she was on her way to grinning big, but the end of my spiel made her scrunch up her nose. “Woman. There is no need to be that negative. Sometimes good things last,” she said. Then she rolled her eyes at herself. “I know I’m not the best person to sell that point because me and Mike are… whatever we are… but if I can tell you one thing for sure, it’s that I’ve never seen you smile as hard as you’ve smiled all day today.” I bit back my lip. “He’s definitely helping me relax and enjoy myself for once,” I said quietly. “Which is… still kind of weird to think about.” It felt like I’d spent my entire life on edge – like every second was devoted to trying to prove myself or please someone. A lot of that was due to Emmett, too, so I’d never in a million years expect him to be the one responsible for finally teaching me to breathe. To just let myself live in the moment and actually have fun. But that was the case, and I was starting to learn that sometimes, the unpredictable parts of life could in fact work in your way. “Well, you know what I say?” Evie asked, putting a smirk on my lips as I heard the sound of her rolling her chair over to mine. “I say you deserve it,” she declared, throwing her arms over my shoulders. “And so do I.” “What do you mean?” I snorted. “I mean the application for or new liquor license got magically pushed through today,” she said as I gasped like it was Christmas morning. “And since I’m pretty sure it was your eight-pack-havin’ boyfriend who helped us out with that, I’m gonna tell you now to fuck him extra good tonight. As a thank you from us both.” “Oh. My God, Evie,” I wrinkled my nose as she burst out laughing. “Sorry. For that, I’ll finish closing on my own,” she said, grabbing my purse off the hook and tossing it onto my lap. “Now go shop with your man. He’s been waiting long enough for you.” * * * The store Emmett chose was the boutique two doors from Blue Harbor. I thought it was funny at first because I assumed he’d chosen the place out of convenience. Considering it was right next to his restaurant, I figured it was the only women’s store he knew. But when I walked in, I realized it was more to do with it being fucking beautiful inside. Holy crap, I thought as I stood by the door and took in the bright room filled with dresses that looked plucked from the runway. They hung illuminated from glass shelves that were flanked on each end by white pillars holding gorgeous floral arrangements that swept the floors. And if that weren’t all charming enough, we were soon approached by a pixie-haired salesgirl who introduced herself as Rose before handing over two glasses of champagne. “None for me, thank you,” Emmett said graciously before frowning down at his ringing phone. “But I’m sure my girlfriend wouldn’t mind taking my share.” Both the salesgirl and I lifted our eyebrows at that one. My girlfriend. I’d heard the g word from Evie and Hannah all day, but hearing it from Emmett’s mouth was an entirely different story. It had me feeling as bubbly as my drink as I watched Emmett excuse himself to take his call. “So,” Rose grinned as we perused the racks of dresses. “I take it you’re the lucky one who stole him away from us?” My eyebrows went up yet again. “I’m sorry?” “Oh, the shop girls and I – we go to Blue Harbor for drinks after our shifts. We usually see Emmett there with his friends most nights, but not so much the past few weeks,” she said, plucking a pink dress off the rack and squinting as she held it to my front. “Is it because he’s been staying home with you?” she asked with a little smirk. “Oh.” My lashes fluttered. “Actually… maybe,” I said as I eyed Emmett across the room. I’d never considered the fact that he may have changed his habits or ever canceled plans for me, but from what Rose was saying, that may very well have been the case. “Well then whatever you’re doing, keep doing it.” She draped the pink dress over her arm and plucked another off the rack. “Because that man’s definitely never liked a girl enough to stay home for her – or go shopping with her for that matter.” I let myself smile. “And you know this because?” “Because tracking that man’s relationship status is just a thing we do in this town every summer,” Rose laughed almost sheepishly. Then she wiggled her eyebrows at me. “At least it was until now.” “Huh. I see,” I murmured, grinning into my flute of champagne as I took a drink. I tried not to let her words sway me too much, but as I sipped and shopped on, I couldn’t help but feel like I was walking on a cloud. I’d already been on a high with Emmett these days, but now Rose had me feeling like I’d landed East Hampton’s most eligible bachelor. I didn’t even care that he wound up spending such an unexpectedly long time on the phone. For starters, the call sounded important and honestly, it didn’t matter since I heard him come over to the dressing room the second he hung up. “Baby. Did you find anything you like?” he asked. I grinned at him calling me “baby” in public. Definitely a first. I wasn’t even fully dressed, but I didn’t care. We’d spent all of ten minutes apart but I already missed his face, so once I slipped into some strappy heels, I swung open the door. “Whoa.” Emmett’s eyebrows ascended at the pinkish-gold dress stretched over my body, zipped only a third of the way in the back. “That’s...” Emmett nodded as he simply stood there for a second. He looked almost lost as he dragged a hand across his jaw, staring unblinkingly at me. “Yeah. That’s the one,” he finally said, ripping his gaze off my front to look at me. “Right?” I giggled at his ridiculously adorable reaction. “I think so. I just need to make sure it fits. Will you zip the back for me?” I asked, gathering my hair and turning around. I smirked at Emmett through the reflection of the mirror, watching him drift into the fitting room and lock his heavy stare on my backside. “It’s actually painful how fucking beautiful you are,” he muttered, cupping my waist and running his hands down the curve of my hips before sucking in a deep breath to focus on my zipper. “Why does it look like zipping me up takes every ounce of your strength?” I teased. “Because that’s exactly what it does when all I ever want is you naked.” Oh. My eyes fluttered. Well then, I thought, biting back a little grin as Emmett finally started helping me with my dress. Holding my hair off my neck, I watched him through the mirror. His eyebrows were pulled tight by the sexiest frown I’d ever seen in my life, and his head was tilted just so, his eyes drifting up my naked back as he slowly zipped me up. When he was done, he stepped back so that we could both gaze at my reflection. “I love it,” I murmured. And I meant it, despite the fact that the dress felt entirely too tight on me. But since it was my size, and since it zipped easily on me, I had a feeling the sensation was mostly to do with the fact that Emmett looked ready to rip the thing off my body. I wasn’t remotely surprised when he broke the silence by asking if I needed him to unzip me. A slow smile spread my lips as I peered over my shoulder. “Sure,” I said warily, half-expecting Emmett to yank the dress off my body as soon as he touched me. But instead, Emmett simply tipped my chin up, closing his mouth over mine and kissing me sweetly as he pulled the zipper down on my dress. I let my eyes fall shut as he teased me, his tongue flicking so softly, so leisurely against mine that when he finally gave me a full lick, I felt an instant rush of wetness. As if sensing it, Emmett kissed me harder, crushing his lips against mine and greedily tasting every corner
 of my mouth. Silly me, I thought when I heard him kick the door shut. I’d really thought that Emmett would kiss me and leave it at that. I’d somehow forgotten that we were both physically incapable of keeping our hands off of each other, no matter where the hell we were. Honestly, it was a mystery that I’d ever gone twelve years without seeing this man, because now I needed him and his body like I needed water and air. “Emmett…” I whispered, pulling away from his kiss when I felt a gust of cold air hit the backs of my legs. It took a moment for me to realize that he’d gathered up my long skirt, holding it scrunched in his hands. I held my breath for the moment he lifted it to find that I wasn’t wearing panties. Bracing myself with my hands on the mirror, I gazed into the reflection, just waiting for him to notice. When I caught Emmett’s eyebrow cock up, I bit my lip. “Christ,” he muttered, taking a moment to gather himself. “Is this becoming a habit?” he asked, his voice thick with lust as he reached between my thighs and parted my pussy. “I took them off,” I explained, breathing out hard as he dipped his fingers into my wetness. “I didn’t want panty lines.” “Mm-hm.” He wasn’t listening anymore. That much was evident as he tilted his head, watching himself as he pumped his fingers slowly inside me. My fingers curled on the cold mirror, my stomach tightening as I imagined the salesgirl knocking at any second. “You’re so wet you’re dripping down your thighs,” Emmett murmured, so aroused he sounded angry. “Well, what do you want me to do about it?” I sassed, my heart thumping when his stare flickered up at me. “I want to watch you sink that pussy down to the base of my cock. That’s what I want you to do,” he muttered, his hot gaze pinned to my reflection as he withdrew his slick fingers to palm me from behind, his middle finger playing with my clit. “But since I don’t have a condom, I’ll settle for watching you while I make you come in this dress.” With that promise, he pushed deeper inside me, his other hand fondling my breast. My eyelids grew heavy as he buried his mouth into the curve of my neck, still eyeing me through the mirror as he sucked on my skin. “You’re soaked,” he said, squeezing my tits mercilessly as he slid a third finger inside me. My eyes rolled back. God, it felt good. Way too good. It made me crave his cock so desperately he could feel it. “Fuck, baby, don’t clench so tight around me,” he growled, a groan at the edge of his lips. “You’re making my dick so fucking hard.” “Let me feel it,” I breathed, swallowing a moan when he pressed his clothed cock to my bare pussy. My mouth hung open as I gripped the edges of the mirror and watched his reflection. His teeth were gnashed and his jaw was tight as he grasped my hips, thrusting against me, pressing every inch of his hard-on tight against my sex. “I want it inside,” I whispered as his groan poured out. “Don’t say that to me right now.” “I mean it,” I breathed, catching his eye in the mirror. “I’m on the pill, and I’m clean, so if you are…” Emmett stared at me, temptation thick in his gaze. Every second after that was a delirious blur. I heard his breath shorten as his belt jangled. I caught the glint of blue in the mirror as he locked his stare on me. But the moment I felt his bare tip nudge my folds, my head dizzied. The second I felt his cock push inside me, I was done for. “Aly,” Emmett groaned, holding me up as my legs buckled. “Holy fuck.” I was right there with him, unable to suppress my sounds of pleasure. I was in awe of how good it felt to have absolutely nothing between us. His cock felt almost painfully hot inside me. I could feel its every throb, its every ridge as Emmett rocked his hips, fucking me like we were home. He held nothing back, fisting my waist and letting his belt buckle jangle as he pumped inside me, each stroke deeper than the last. “Yes, baby. Ride my cock,” Emmett rasped, his voice tinged with awe as I moved my hips to meet him halfway. “That’s right,” he breathed, releasing my hips to rake his fingers through his hair. I watched his eyes glaze over, his jaw going slack as he took in the view of my pussy sliding up and down his shaft. “You’re getting my dick so wet with your juices, baby,” he whispered, pleasure rising from the bottom of his throat as I took more and more of him inside me, letting his thickness stretch me perfectly tight around him. The second I dropped all the way down to his thick root, he growled my name like no one could hear. And while that definitely wasn’t the case, I couldn’t care anymore. I was beside myself. In pure ecstasy. I didn’t even know when or how Emmett spun me around and lifted me in his strong arms. All I knew was that I was clean off the ground, my legs bouncing in the air as he gripped me under my thighs and fucked me against the wall. I knew he could feel when I was close because he pulled away from our kiss to watch me, murmuring filthy encouragement till I bucked against his chest. “Do it, baby,” Emmett panted. “Come all over my cock. Let me feel it.” That was all I needed to hear to fall apart in his arms, trembling against his chest and soaking in the way he groaned through every second of my orgasm. I knew what it meant. I knew he was holding out for me to finish, ready to explode the second I was done. And when I was, he did. Our eyes blazed into each other as Emmett pumped the heat of his pleasure inside me, aftershocks rippling through our bodies. Our stares refused to break as we caught our breaths, and even after we’d both come down from our incredible heights. We didn’t say a word as he helped me the rest of the way out of my dress, but despite the utter silence, the air was thick, filled to the brim with words unsaid. I could feel it and I knew Emmett could because before he left the dressing room, he looked at me with a crooked little grin I’d never seen before. It made heat rush to my cheeks and as I closed the door, I went ahead and let the strange truth hit me. It was hard to admit, and I didn’t fully trust myself doing it. But I also couldn’t deny it. I was falling. Fast and hard – and of all people, for Emmett Hoult.            27  ALY    Once upon a time, mornings were a breeze for me. I had a whole system for it. I’d set three alarms at fifteen-minute intervals, the last of which was the “real” time I needed to be up. Once the last one sounded, I’d open my eyes, swing my legs out of bed, and sit up for five to ten seconds before dragging my feet to the bathroom. In there, the first thing I did was splash cold water onto my face. And from there, it was a breeze. A painful, exhausting, bleary-eyed breeze. But still. I was used to it. I didn’t totally mind it. I pretty much could never wait to get to work anyway, because there was always something I was eager to fix or get done. In short, mornings for me were on autopilot. Well. At least they were till I started sleeping with Emmett. It was damned near impossible to leave him in the morning, especially since it required wiggling out of his embrace, which was basically like waking up to a daily morning torture. On the particularly rough mornings, Emmett would stir and manage a few adorably sleepy words of protest – usually “stay with me” or “five more minutes,” the latter of which always included a groggy little grin. Because the first and only time I stayed five more minutes, it wound up being twenty. And when I gasped myself awake and tried to wiggle out of his arms, he locked them tight around me, keeping me trapped in his embrace for another ten seconds while he buried sleepy kisses in my hair. Lord. Leaving bed after that was the actual worst, and I wound up spending the first few hours at work pouting over how much I missed him. “That’s a good problem, ya ding-dong.” Those were Evie’s wise words to me that morning. The exact words, actually, were that’s a good problem, ya lucky fuckin’ ding-dong, but that didn’t stop me from mentally replaying them today as I lifted Emmett’s gorgeous arms off my body and crawled quietly out of bed. “Morning,” I whispered to Ozzy. As usual, he watched me from his corner, stretching lazily and waiting for me to pass by him on my way to the bathroom. Once I did, he got up, his tail wagging as he sniffed a polite hello around my legs. He’d see me out of the room, but within my first two steps into the hallway, I’d hear him hop up onto Emmett’s bed and get comfy in the spot I’d just left. It was no different this morning and it made me smirk. As Emmett predicted, Ozzy was getting used to me and in some way, it made leaving Emmett a little easier. At least I knew someone was happy about the situation. * * * Thanks to my longer-than-usual shower, I didn’t get downstairs till about half past five. I still had to pack up my bag but that only took about five minutes, and that was fine since Emmett and I had stocked up at the grocery store last night, which meant we had more than enough options for on-the-go breakfasts. I was already planning on a banana and vanilla Greek yogurt, but once I got into the kitchen, I froze. Holy what. A stunned smile drifted onto my lips as I stood and stared at my surprise view this morning: Emmett shirtless, wearing just sweats and a backwards cap on his head as he toiled over the stove. Oh… my frickin’ word. On the cutting board next to him, I could see some leftover mise en place that was so perfectly chopped that I wanted to ask when the heck he’d learned to cook. But I kept my mouth shut because priority went to soaking all this in – especially when he started tossing the contents of his sauté pan. It prompted his bicep to flex, and it made all those muscled lines in his back move in a way that had me damned near drooling on the floor. I honestly could’ve stood there watching till noon, but there was still that whole getting to work thing to remember,
 so I made myself snap out of it. “Good morning?” I finally said, the biggest grin on my face when Emmett tossed his cooking rag over his naked shoulder and turned around. Good God. This man. This view. It was even cuter to me that he still looked sleepy as hell while doing all this for me. “’Morning,” he said, lowering the heat on the stove before he grabbed a mug he’d pre-set next to the coffee maker, filling it up before coming to me. As he wrapped my hands around the mug, he kissed me. “Hey.” “Hey yourself,” I murmured. I could almost feel the awe glimmering in my eyes as I gazed up at him. “I can’t believe you’re up this early.” “I wanted you to have a nice breakfast before work,” he said simply, nodding for me to take a seat at the counter. “I cleaned up the stuff on the dining room table and put it in your folder, which should save you a couple minutes, right?” I stared at him in a daze. “Uh-huh,” I replied while wondering what the hell I’d done to deserve this man. I cocked my head curiously as I watched him put the finishing touches on whatever he was cooking in the pan. Another sprinkle of salt, a dash of pepper, and suddenly, there was a gorgeous thick-cut bacon and sweet corn hash on the plate before me. I was impressed enough with that, but then Emmett opened the oven and took out two perfectly browned pieces of toast, and baked eggs in a cast iron skillet. I stared at him. “Emmett… for lack of better words, what the fuck?” I burst out laughing. I laughed even harder when I finally got a big, sleepy grin from him as he finished plating in front of me. “I feel like I’m at some super fancy restaurant. Do you realize how much money a restaurant could make if you were the chef and you served everyone shirtless?” “That’s definitely an idea. But I only bust out these moves for a select few people.” “That’s smart, because if you did this for any of your hook-ups, they’d fall instantly in love with you.” “Is that what you’re doing with me right now?” Emmett asked, flashing me a teasing smirk that almost stopped my heart. But before I could consider just letting it all out and saying something crazy, he moved mercifully on. “You need cream for you coffee, right? Half-and-half?” “Yes. I can get it – ” “No, I’ll get it. Start eating. You only have a little more than ten minutes.” I didn’t argue because honestly, the food was calling to me and within the first bite, I had a moment and shoveled in two more before I once again cast my twinkly wonder-eyes at Emmett. “Emmett. This is delicious. This is better than stuff I’ve had at restaurants,” I said seriously as he poured a bit of cream in my coffee. “When the hell did you learn to cook like this?” I asked. “When we were in high school, you used to set off the fire alarm while using the microwave.” He laughed. “Yeah. I think it was actually a talent how bad I was at cooking then.” “You messed up instant ramen once.” “Sure did.” “So… explanations? Please?” I asked, watching Emmett’s shoulders widen as he leaned across the counter from me, digging in to the plate he made for himself – which I noted was plated much less nicely than mine. “When I was in college, my other roommate Lukas taught me the basics. Mostly how to cook eggs.” “Where’d you learn the rest of it then?” I asked. “How’d you learn to prep and time and plate so perfectly? Because I’m kind of amazed right now.” Emmett blinked, like he thought his answer before had been sufficient enough explanation. “I don’t know,” he finally said. “I just had to learn. I needed to feed myself. The cafeteria food at college wasn’t the best.” I narrowed my eyes at him. “You used to eat plain cold cuts in high school because you were too lazy to get bread from the pantry. I also recall the fact that you were happy to eat multiple bowls of cereal for dinner, because ‘cereal’s already here and ordering out takes time.’” Emmett squinted as he recalled those memories with me. “That’s… yep. That’s completely accurate,” he laughed, wrinkling his nose at his former self. “Speaking of dinner though, one of my friends opened a restaurant in Montauk. Can I take you tonight?” he asked, making my heart flutter. God, was I ever going to get used to him asking me out on dates? Because so far, I was actually getting increasingly giddy with each invitation. “Of course,” I replied. “Is it a super fancy place that requires me dressing nicely?” “No, but if you want some new dresses, I’m more than happy to go shopping again,” Emmett grinned, making me giggle. “You better not talk about that because we don’t have the time to get all turned on right now.” “Fuck. True,” Emmett said, reaching down to presumably adjust his junk as he eyed the clock. “You got two minutes to finish eating.” “No way am I gonna finish all this, but I’m already very full and content,” I said, dunking a bit of toast in my broken egg yolk. “But you should definitely finish it.” “I’ll save the hash for later.” “Why? Going right back to bed once I leave?” I smirked. “You bet your sexy ass I am,” he yawned, stretching across the counter and flexing every stone-carved muscle on his naked torso. Good Lord. And after that, he hit me with that sleepy grin that was so damned cute I almost fell out of my chair. Seriously. How was I supposed to leave this? As the last few minutes of our surprise breakfast wound down, I went back to chanting Evie’s mantra. You’re a fucking lucky girl. And this is a good problem to have.            28  EMMETT    “I have fish guts on me,” Aly declared the second she got home. I laughed and stopped in the middle of getting up off the couch, because I knew from the mild panic in her voice that she was warning me not to hug her. “Got it.” “Don’t come near me! I’m gross and I need to pop in the shower real quick, but I won’t make us late for dinner – promise!” she yelled from the foyer before dropping her things to the floor and rushing up the stairs. “Now you get five more minutes,” I said to Ozzy, who was passed out on the couch with his head in my lap. I ruffled his head just as my phone lit up with more texts from Drew. He’d been live-updating me on his hangover since waking up literally an hour ago – which I guess wasn’t that bad for going to bed at 8AM.   DREW: Yeah so I have no idea what I did last night but I just woke up to this   Paired with the text was a picture of the insane mess in his living room. There were empty bottles, playing cards and women’s underwear littered all over the floor. His coffee table was turned upside down and strung in pink Christmas lights, which I was pretty sure he didn’t keep in the house, and weirdest of all, there was a huge, angry-looking cat sitting on top of his open fridge.   ME: lol whose cat is that? DREW: Fuck if I know but he won’t stop staring at me send help   I laughed so hard I woke up Ozzy, who shot me a dirty look before hopping off the couch and trotting off somewhere else.   ME: I don’t know man I heard when you find cats in your house that means they’re yours now DREW: Please no I fucking hate cats DREW: This wasn’t what I meant last night when I asked God for some good pussy ME: Jesus Christ   I tossed my phone aside, snorting to myself for a second while wondering how the hell I’d lived the same life as Drew just a month ago. We’d pretty much wake up late from drinking late, and after a workout, a few meals and a shower, we’d be back at it, getting dinner and drinks before hitting the club and letting the night go on from there. Night after night – rinse and repeat. I’d never gotten sick of it, so I was surprised to realize now that I was content to move on from it. I’d spent most of my life partying my ass off, and I always figured that somewhere down the line, I’d start getting tired and ease out of it. Julian guessed it would happen in my forties. But apparently, it was possible for it to just happen one day. It was sometime during the last month, and I wasn’t sure when, but I did know it had to do with the fact that there was a girl in my house who I never stopped thinking about – who I couldn’t seem to spend enough time with. Apparently, the option of going to bed with her every night was all I needed to do a one-eighty.   DREW: You coming to 1OAK tonight? DREW: Nevermind don’t answer that DREW: Don’t know why I asked. I’m hung over   I snorted, about to reply till I heard a plastic bag rustling in the foyer. “Hey!” I said, immediately popping up to get Ozzy out of whatever he was snooping into. In the foyer, I grabbed a new tube of mascara out of his mouth before swiping the bag off the floor and bringing it into the kitchen. It was stretched and a little ripped thanks to Ozzy, so I couldn’t help but notice all the little drugstore purchases inside. I smirked because the pink razor was definitely for Aly, but the rest was undoubtedly picked up with me in mind. There was no doubting that when it was a tub of the protein powder I’d just run out of yesterday, two six-packs of men’s socks since Ozzy had been hiding mine all week, and a pastel green card with a watercolor stroller painted on the front. There was a swoopy “Congratulations” printed at the top, and I didn’t have to open the card to know that Aly had bought it for whenever Julian and Sara announced the pregnancy. I couldn’t help the big grin on my face as I imagined Aly perusing the aisles of the store and stopping when she spotted the card. I could just imagine the faint smile on her lips as she picked it up and looked at the pretty picture in the front. It hit me with the sudden need to go upstairs so turning around, I headed up the stairs to her bathroom and walked right in while she was showering. “Hey!” she said with surprise when I opened the door and laughed at the clouds of suds in her hair. “What’s up? What’s going on?” I shook my head as if to say “nothing” but the words that came out instead were, “I love you.” The
 smile on her lips faded only to light up in her eyes. They were bright and glittery as she stared at me for several seconds. Then she stepped out from under the water and came up to me, her wet hands soaking my shirt as she grabbed two handfuls, went on her tiptoes and pressed a kiss to my lips. When she pulled away, she looked me in the eye, unraveling everything inside me as she murmured, “I love you, Emmett Hoult.”            29  ALY    “I have something to ask you and something to tell you.” The cautious way in which Emmett presented that information after we sat at dinner probably should’ve had me at least a little concerned, but I was still to high on cloud nine to pay it much attention. I hadn’t expected him to say I love you. Technically, he’d already done it. He’d told me that he loved me the night after my so-called date with Drew Maddox, and while I don’t think he was talking about the same kind of love that night, I was pretty sure that that was all I was going to get for awhile. So hearing it when I least expected it today was beyond a pleasant surprise. It was easily the sweetest thing that had ever happened to me, and it had me far too bubble-headed to overanalyze what Emmett was slightly frowning about. So with a sip of my wine, I simply nodded and said, “Hit me.” “When was the last time you saw your dad?” Emmett asked right away. I paused for a few seconds. “Um. Maybe December for Christmas?” I answered, raising my eyebrows when I realized that was more than half a year ago. “Wow. It’s weird. It doesn’t feel that long ago because I know he’s so close by. And I still hear him in the background when my mom calls every week. I mean talk sometimes, too. Never for more than a minute or so, but it’s just the relationship I have with him. And I’ve obviously always wanted more, but it is what it is. I’m too exhausted to try to talk to him about it now. Besides, it doesn’t break my heart on a daily basis anymore.” Emmett nodded, though a frown knit his brow as he played with his fork for a second and looked out the window at the water. “I was really happy when Mom told me you bought his company. I thought that would fix everything,” he finally said. “Yeah,” I nodded with a sad laugh. “Me too. Though I’m starting to realize that I’m still happy with all the choices I made. All the hard work I put in,” I said, watching the dancing flame on the candle between us. “Even if it didn’t work to win his approval, it’s still the first thing I did on my own. And I don’t know why, but the more I work and the more established the restaurant gets, the less I feel the need to prove myself to him.” “Because you’ve already proved yourself to yourself,” Emmett grinned, as if it were obvious. “You’re a fucking rock star. Not a lot of people can do what you did and sacrifice so much of their lives to achieving a goal. God knows I don’t have that kind of hustle in me,” he smirked. “That’s not true, Emmett,” I laughed, smiling down at his hand when he placed it over mine. “Maybe you had a head start, but that doesn’t mean you didn’t have to keep working to maintain everything you have.” “That’s definitely a good word to describe my life. Maintenance,” Emmett said with an unreadable look on his face. But before I could ask him to clarify, he moved swiftly on. “Anyway, the other thing I meant to tell you is that your dad might show up to the gala on Saturday.” He winced. “Will that be okay for you?” I blinked for a couple seconds, unsure of the answer myself. “Yeah,” I finally said. “That’s fine, honestly. I’d kind of stopped expecting things from Dad awhile ago. And I think,” I shot Emmett a wiggly, sheepish smile, “that when you knocked some sense into me the morning after I moved out, I realized… as sad as it sounds… that I was holding onto something that was never there. There never really was hope to get him to love me – not the way I always wanted, at least.” “Aly,” Emmett frowned deeply, squeezing my hand. “I’m sorry for everything I said that day. I know it was harsh, and it was – ” “True,” I cut in, offering a bit of a smile to ease his tension. “Everything you said that day was true, Emmett, and the fact that I avoided you all those years kind of proves it. I knew you were the only one who knew me well enough to call me out and pull me out of delusion,” I said. “And as hard as it as to accept that I’d lied to myself most of my life, it was also a huge weight off my back. Because now I don’t actually want to try anymore. I’m not living to impress my dad. Holding out hope for someone who doesn’t even think about you on a daily basis is pretty much the most painful waste of time in the world, and I realize that now,” I finished. My voice was soft but strong because I believed every word that I said. “I realized it too late, but at least I did at all. Thanks to you.” The candlelight flickered against his skin as he gazed at me for a little. “You’re impressive. You know that?” he finally said, making a shy grin curve on my lips. “Why are you saying this?” “Because you’re strong and smart, and you’ve done everything on your own,” Emmett answered easily. “You’ve been knocked down however many times, and you’ve never stayed on the ground. I don’t know what that’s like. My dad used to say, ‘When it comes to the race of life, you two were dropped off way ahead of the others. You should always know and remember that.’ And I did, but it never hit me quite as hard as it’s hitting me now,” Emmett admitted as he studied me intently. “And it just makes me that much more amazed by you.” I looked down as I blushed. God, this man knew how to make me swoon. Touching the back of my neck, I gazed down at the table, my heart quietly soaring as Emmett lifted my hand to his lips and gave me a kiss. “Well, before you get too proud of me,” I started jokingly, “I feel like I should admit that I have a petty side to me.” Emmett laughed. “Yeah?” “Oh yeah. As much as I’m getting over my whole thing with Dad, I still want to hear him admit that I did good – and not just good, but better than him. I know that’s kind of evil, and that I shouldn’t care, but I do.” “That’s fine,” Emmett reassured me. “You deserve recognition for what you did.” “I don’t need it though,” I admitted. “At this point, I’m pretty sure I have everything I need to be happy,” I said, blushing a little as I looked up to meet his eye. “I’m pretty sure I do too,” he said, holding his gaze. “Actually, I know that I do,” he corrected himself. “And I know that if you ever so much as think you’re missing something, I’ll find it for you,” he promised sweetly, rubbing his thumb over the back of my hand. “Because I’ve honestly only ever wanted you to be happy.” All I could do was nod in reply because I was too choked up to speak. He had me just about melting in my chair with that one, and it made me thankful for the distraction of two servers coming by to present a bunch of beautiful appetizers we didn’t even order. Apparently, Emmett’s owner friend had just instructed the kitchen to send them out. As they were set down in front of us, our main server came by to explain each dish before whisking away our empty wine glasses and bringing a new pairing to match the food. “Good Lord,” I breathed out, shaking my head at Emmett when we were alone again. “What?” “Nothing. I’m just still amazed by the perks that come with being Emmett Hoult’s girlfriend.” “Well, stick around,” he smirked. “You ain’t seen nothing yet.” I grinned. I definitely believed him on that one, and as the drinks kept coming, it was hard not to let my bubbly brain get carried away in fantasy. I knew it was dangerous and presumptuous, but my imagination was giving me images from next summer – when I’d have enough money to plan dates myself and take Emmett out to do things. I knew I’d probably never make quite as much money as him, but it was just the gesture. I just wanted him to know how much I appreciated him – how much I recognized his patience for me all these years. After all, he had just as much a right to hold a grudge against me, but he never did. “Aly, Julian’s called twice for some reason. Do you mind if I take it?” Emmett asked as our entrée courses were cleared. “Go for it,” I said breezily, resting my chin in my hands as I watched him walk away. I laughed to myself a bit as I watched all the female eyes he passed follow and stick to him, aggressively checking him out in the way I couldn’t blame them for. He definitely looked sexy as ever in grey jeans and a lightweight Henley that was basically made to call attention to his pecs and biceps. I was still checking him out when I heard heeled footsteps draw close to me. “Omigod – Aly Stanton? Bitch, get over here!” My jaw dropped even before I turned around but when I did, I was instantly pulled into the world’s tightest hug. I hadn’t even seen her face yet, but I already knew who it was. “Drea!” I gasped, already forced to catch my breath when we pulled away because the excitement was so instant. “I haven’t seen you in so long!” “Three years I think!” Drea squealed, pulling me into another tight hug that wound up getting both my blonde locks and her platinum curls caught in her earring. “Oops – careful. They’re expensive and I like my earlobes!” she squeaked as we untangled ourselves, taking another half-minute or so to come down from our giggles. “Holy shit, lady. I don’t even know how I recognized you with the long hair! You look amazing!” “And you. I didn’t think you could get more glamorous but you proved me wrong!” I pulled back to assess her outfit from head to toe. Aside from being my former boss and mentor, Drea van Dahl had also always been my style icon, and today was no different. She looked stunning in a checkered mini-dress with a long, white blazer worn over. “So what are you doing in Montauk?” “Oh, I’m just here to visit some college friends, but I was
 thinking of you because I’ve been reading such amazing things about your restaurant, and I am so proud!” she said, getting all gushy and giggly again with those last five words. “Psh, well, I couldn’t have done it without you! You showed me the ropes on how to do pretty much everything that I needed to – ” “Oh!” Drea interrupted me with a little gasp, and only then did I realize that she had just noticed Emmett on his way back to the table. “Oh.” I bit my smile. “That’s just – ” “Emmett?” Drea breathed, her long lashes fluttering as he looked up and stopped in his tracks. He blinked. “Shit. Drea.” Oh… kay. I stood there awkwardly because for the next few seconds, it was dead silent, and I could see the smirking assumptions of the people in the adjacent tables that peered up curiously at the situation. My face burned because I knew what they were thinking – that I was the girlfriend. Emmett was the boyfriend. And Drea was the ex. “I didn’t expect to see you here,” she said. “Me neither. What are you doing here?” Emmett asked, sounding just slightly more confused than he did annoyed. “I… was just eating?” Drea replied, her voice also a mix of something. From what I could tell it was shock and nerves, with a hint of apology. And with that, I was pretty sure I’d just confirmed the whole ex theory. Shit. And considering Emmett only had one ex in his entire history of dating, that meant Drea was the one – the mystery girl who did such a number on him that he made that whole ten-day rule. Holy fuck. My legs felt like lead as I stood there, unsure of what to do or say as another minute of strained conversation went on. But when it ended, it was my turn to feel a mix of emotions, because suddenly Drea was smiling awkwardly, giving Emmett a goodbye nod before facing me and saying, “It was so, so good to see you, Aly,” before walking away. * * * In the car, on the way home, I mentally wound the timeline back. And it all made sense. Drea had gone to Temple University for business management, and their campus was less than a twenty-minute drive from UPenn, where Emmett went. I didn’t need to reactivate my Facebook to know that they probably had mutual friends. I also didn’t need to see what Drea looked like in college to know that she was exactly the kind of sorority girl Emmett went for. Bubbly. Blonde. Legs for days. Thinking about it, I couldn’t even be mad. Heartbroken, sure. Insecure, yes. But not mad. Because I knew well how Drea van Dahl could mean the world to someone. She definitely meant the world to me. I had been applying to Vandermark Restaurants for ages before she finally emailed me back one day. The company was the most notable restaurant group in Manhattan, and having mapped out my plan to save Dad’s business, I knew Vandermark was the best place for me to get connections, network my ass off and fully grasp the industry in the way I needed to if I wanted to successfully open a restaurant. And Drea wound up like my fairy godmother there. She took me under her wing. She was patient and nurturing. When I was down, she made me feel taken care of. When I was up, she fanned the fire of my confidence and reminded me that I could achieve anything I wanted. Basically, she was amazing, and I didn’t know how to handle the fact that Emmett had once dated her. Though he vehemently denied the fact at dinner. We had managed to move on from the Drea fiasco, though it was not without me actively trying. I’d pried for as long as I could, asking Emmett who she was to him. He said they had worked with each other in the past but preferred to move on from the topic, and that we could talk about it another time. And for a multitude of reasons, I obliged. One, I didn’t want to ruin the otherwise beautiful night we’d had so far. Two, my faith in Emmett was in no way shaken. I wouldn’t let it be. He loved me, and I knew that. He said he’d do anything to make me happy, and I believed him – especially that night when we climbed into bed, and I nestled back into his chest. We got into position as he draped his arm over me, tucking his palm under my ribs and cupping my breast. His thumb moved back and forth over my nipple as he kissed the top of my head, letting out that low, rumbly mmm that just sounded like home. It was all I needed to hear to feel just fine. Because as far as I knew, everyone had a past. But that didn’t mean that the present counted for nothing. In fact, it only made it count for that much more. After all, in the present, we were older and wiser. We’d survived our hurdles and learned our lessons, which meant the decisions we made now were the ones we knew were best for us. So as I drifted off to sleep, I did it at ease, with a smile. Because in this room, in these arms, I was convinced that this was exactly what love felt like.            30  ALY    I knew that the next day, Emmett had meetings in the city from noon to seven. They were all regarding Saturday’s gala, and I could tell they had him tired by the middle of the day, because he called sounding exhausted. “I know you’re at work. I just wanted to hear your voice,” he said as a bunch of cars honked in the background. When he asked about work, I told him about the nice guests who left Hannah a fifty percent tip, which led Evie and me to Google them, which led us to the discovery that they were huge food bloggers with several million followers on Instagram. They’d already posted pictures of our lobster roll and Bloody Mary, so we were fairly stoked on that. And as it turned out, I needed the good mood. Because by 10PM, Emmett called to let me know he wouldn’t be coming home. “I’m sorry, baby. The dinner with the gala speakers went long, and I was already on the Upper East Side, so I figured I’d just see Mom and Gram and sleep here for the night,” he said as I walked around the big, empty kitchen, staring out the windows into the dark of the yard. “Do you want me to call Julian to pick up Ozzy?” “No, silly,” I said. “I can take care of Ozzy. I’ll wake up a little earlier in the morning so I can take him out.” “Baby, no. You need every minute of sleep you can get.” “Trust me – fifteen minutes won’t make a difference. And it’ll be easier for me to get out of bed when you’re not there.” He made a pained noise. “I didn’t say that to make you feel bad,” I laughed gently. “I know. But it made me remember that I’m going to be waking up alone in the morning,” he grumbled. “And I’ve kind of gotten spoiled with you.” “Trust me. I’m in the same boat,” I sighed as I refilled Ozzy’s water bowl. “But it’s okay.” “Alright. Well, I’ll see you tomorrow.” I blinked, a bit jolted by the sudden goodbye. “You have to go?” I asked. He paused. “Yeah. I think I’m going to go to bed soon.” I glanced at the time. A quarter to ten. I frowned. “So early,” I remarked. “But you’ve had a long day.” “Yeah. I’ll text you in the morning, okay?” he said. “Okay.” I made my voice sound light despite the fact that I was standing in the middle of the kitchen, holding Ozzy’s water bowl and feeling vaguely lost – at least until Emmett’s next few words. “I love you, baby,” he said in the kind of tired murmur that made me feel like he was holding me in bed, saying goodnight to me. Whatever weight had begun to sag in my heart, I felt it lift as I returned his words with a little smile. “I love you, too.” * * * It wasn’t till the end of work the next day that I felt a tinge of concern. Or maybe it started in the morning. I’d felt instantly disoriented since I’d woken up in the guest room for the first time in ages, but I refused to let it bother me much. I threw my legs over the bed – or rather, I tried but then I realized they were trapped under the blankets because Ozzy was sleeping at the end of my mattress, pinning my sheets down. With a giggle and a nudge, I woke him up and noted that I actually hadn’t slept alone all night. So there was that. In the bathroom, I stared at my reflection in the mirror throughout my tooth brushing, instead of drifting in and out of the bathroom and the hall, the way I usually did when I knew Emmett was just a few doors down. Getting ready without knowing he was asleep in his room was a strangely empty feeling. I definitely felt a bit off as I left the house. But still, I told myself that today would be fine – like any other – and to just carry on. So I did. Despite a handful of particularly rude tables in the afternoon, I coasted through service without a single hiccup affecting my mood. We were out of both the lobster roll and the Hail Mary, which earned me the fiery wrath of a good dozen or so guests, but I just turned up the charm and sent out crab cakes on the house as a sorry. The PM hostess wound up a no-call no-show during the lunch rush, but I was unflappable, opting to finish my paperwork at home so I could take her place and stand up front. It wasn’t till my quick breather in the office that I felt the first chip at my confidence.   EMMETT: Baby EMMETT: Something came up and I’m not sure I’m going to be able to make it home tonight   I stared at the texts, feeling the adrenaline rush of the day start to crash. Fast and hard. Still, I breathed steady, remaining calm while texting Emmett back.   ME: Will you be home before the gala tomorrow?   His text pinged back immediately.   EMMETT: No   My heart sank. I watched as he typed and deleted his next text several times before finally sending something.   EMMETT: But I’ll arrange your transportation and meet you there.   Oh. Still not all that comforting. I held out hope for some bit of explanation as the ellipses came back for another few seconds. But then it disappeared without a third text. And I wound up sending nothing in reply. I told myself it was actually an adult move, because any text I had in mind would sound undoubtedly passive aggressive. So I stuck with my choice, left my phone on my desk and walked outside
 to calmly inform Evie that I would be requiring her company at home this evening. And of course she said yes, so after work we dropped by her house to grab some of her things and make sure Mike had food for dinner. Then we looped right back to Emmett’s house, poured two glasses of wine and dug into the Ben & Jerry’s we stole from her freezer. “Poor Mike. He’s going to be so sad when he realizes I stole the Milk & Cookies flavor,” Evie said somewhat guiltily. “But this is what he gets for eating my leftovers just because he forgot to buy himself frozen pizza. Oh my God.” She looked up at me mid-bite. “Am I boring the shit out of you? Because I think I just bored the shit out of me. Like, I actually felt it happen.” I snorted. “No, I’d much rather listen to you than all the stupid, paranoid thoughts I’m having, because they’re telling me not to go to the gala tomorrow, and I already know that’ll crush Emmett.” “Damn. Really?” Evie made a face as we headed from the kitchen up to my room with Ozzy trailing behind, his eyes still glued to our ice cream. “Tomorrow means a lot to him, Aly…” “I know. Which is why I don’t want to let this paranoia push me into making a stupid decision. I’m trying to talk myself through it right now.” “Well, talk to me, girl,” she said. “’Cause I’ve been watching you randomly shudder and cringe to yourself all day and I know it’s because you’re bottling up whatever conspiracy theories you’re cookin’ up in that pretty head. So just spill. You know I don’t judge.” I kept my nose wrinkled as we got into my room, and even as we collapsed onto my bed. “Oh my God, this bed is so comfortable,” Evie hissed viciously, groping the hell out of my mattress before sitting up straight, folding her hands in her lap and giving me her serious face. “Okay. I’m here. I’m ready for discussion, and I know this is about Drea, so just get it out.” “Fine,” I exhaled, putting down my spoon. “I just… can’t help but feel weird about the fact that Emmett and I ran into her at dinner, there was clearly something weird between them, he wouldn’t talk to me about it, and then he went MIA for the next two days.” “You think he’s at her place?” Evie winced. “No. Maybe. I don’t know.” My shoulders slumped. “In my heart, I don’t believe it. But she does live in the city. They do have a history. And he did just see her. And if she’s his one and only ex who inspired him to make his no-commitment rule, then there’s clearly a lot of unfinished business between them.” Evie nodded, silently taking it all in before offering her opinion. “Are you ready for my theory?” she asked, plucking my wine off the nightstand and handing it to me. That was how I knew her theory was about to be batshit. “I think that Emmett did not date Drea. But if they met and knew each other in college, that means it was during, you know, the darker times in his life. Maybe he was you know, King Frat Boy throwing some awesome party that she attended, and she walked in on him crying at some point? Like, she saw him while he was weak and down, and he doesn’t like that someone out there has seen that side of him?” Evie was already shaking her head at herself before she could finish. “Nope. That sucks. Ignore it.” “No, I can’t ignore it now, because that actually sounds like the reason why they would get together in the first place. Because his dad just died and he needed someone and aghhhh,” I groaned to the ceiling, which Ozzy interpreted as his invitation to furiously lick under my chin. “Thank you,” I mumbled to him as Evie cooed. “Okay, no more theories, but how ‘bout this?” she finally proposed. “Even if Emmett and Drea did date, he could very well be in the city for gala-only reasons, right? You remember what it was like when we were first opening the restaurant and meeting with a million people every day – by just five o’clock we were pooped. And you said you heard his mom’s voice in the background of your call yesterday, so he definitely did spend at least last night at her house, which counts for something. Doesn’t it?” “Yeah,” I nodded, staring out into space. “And I don’t know why, but I just… have faith in him.” I glanced up at Evie to see if what I said was stupid. “I know we haven’t been dating long,” I prefaced hastily, “and I know I haven’t even known the adult version of Emmett Hoult for that long, but I believe everything he’s told me about loving me. About me being his exception. He’s just been so… quietly good to me for so many years. He let me ignore and blame him for more than a decade, and if he really wanted to, he could’ve gone through my parents to track me down and clear his conscience by calling me out. But he just swallowed it and let me live my lie because he knew it made me feel better. But he still took me in when I needed a place to stay. He said yes to the whole platonic thing. He’s been there for me through this whole psychological emancipation from my dad, and he’s basically been the most incredible friend and boyfriend since we’ve been living together,” I finished breathlessly, my heart swelling as I realized everything aloud. “And I’m just so sold on his love that I can’t see the past two days as red flags. I just want to choose to have faith in him.” When I finally looked back at Evie, she was chewing on her shaky bottom lip. “Fuck, that just made me want to cry.” My mouth wiggled into a pout. “You are crying,” I informed her. “I thought so. Balls,” she muttered, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. “Evie.” I frowned deeply when I realized she was thinking not just of Emmett and me, but of her and Mike. “Oh no, bub.” As she started fully crying, I set aside all our wine and ice cream so that I could wrap her up in my arms, letting Ozzy join in on the group hug since he’d started whimpering over the sound of her tiny sobs. “Everything’s going to be okay,” I murmured, holding her tight, smiling when I heard her weepy giggle over Ozzy’s aggressive kisses. “I know there are points where it doesn’t seem like it,” I said as our roles for the night swiftly reversed. “But I promise everything’s going to turn out fine.”            31  EMMETT    In the morning, I stayed for coffee before taking the subway back downtown to my apartment. I didn’t usually take the train much, but I felt like I needed it this morning to reset. The past two nights had been hard. Mentally exhausting, really, and I needed my brain to be a clean slate for the gala tonight. So after walking cross-town, I hopped the A train and spent the twenty-minute ride people watching. I got off a few stops early to walk and feel the sun on my shoulders, and by the time I was in my elevator, my head was at least a little bit clearer. But I knew I wasn’t completely out of the woods yet. I’d done damage control on the whirlwind that took over the last few nights, but I knew I still had the situation with Aly to fix. She hadn’t texted me back yesterday when I said I couldn’t come home, and after letting two of my calls go to voicemail at night, she finally sent a quick text saying she was fine and she’d see me soon. And most of the time, that text from a girl was my green light to go on with my day – even when I knew that “I’m fine” never actually meant “I’m fine.” But once upon a time, I was also an asshole who was happy to do the bare minimum of communicating, so if I asked what was wrong and got an “I’m fine,” then I was in the clear. I’d tried. But I couldn’t be quite as relaxed when it came to Aly. I couldn’t help but feel anxious and suspect that I’d fucked things up with her on the night that I needed her most, so after I got into my apartment and showered, I canceled my noon meeting, made a note to cancel Ozzy’s walker, and arranged for a car to take me to the heliport. All I wanted was to get to the Hamptons, find Aly at work and take in the comfort of her scent as I wrapped my arms around her tight. That was all I needed to feel okay. I knew that, so when I saw the car waiting for me when I got out of the building, I could feel my heart already lift at the idea of being that much closer to her. But I’d gotten barely two steps into the courtyard when my phone rang. I froze, and when I looked down at the screen, my heart sagged again. “Everything okay?” I answered without saying hello. “Yes. I think so. But… are you available to talk for a minute?” she asked. Her voice was trembling and she was trying to hide it, but I’d always been good at detecting her lies. I quietly drew in a breath, letting it out inaudibly before excusing myself to wave off the car. Then I walked over to the closest bench, sat down and returned the phone to my ear. “Okay. I’m here,” I said. “Talk to me.” * * * The gala was being held at the Atrium, a historic bank-turned-party venue that was the go-to spot for any event my family held. I’d been attending parties there for over twenty years now, and I knew the place by heart, starting with the grand pillared entrance manned by Keith and Barry, the same mustachioed doormen who’d been working there since the eighties. After catching up with them, I strode down the same marble hallway to the main ballroom that all the Hoult Foundation galas were held in. I smiled at Paula, the venue liaison who came up to brief me on all the recent conversations she’d had with Britt and my events planning company. Mid-conversation with her, Julian showed up to let me know that our tuxes had just been messengered over. Everything was running on time. It was all routine and completely familiar. But I was still an anxious wreck. Because even before noon, Aly’s phone had been going directly to voicemail, and it stayed like that even as the gala was well underway. “E. You gotta stop doing that. I can’t be the only one getting anxious just from looking at you.” Drew tugged at the collar of his tux as he watched me check the door for the tenth time in a minute. “Just
 take it easy for a second, alright? She’s probably just doing her hair or something.” “She knows this thing started an hour ago. And she doesn’t take that long to do her hair.” Drew furrowed his forehead as he searched himself for an explanation “Lipstick? Shit, I don’t know. Boss. Help me out here,” he said just as Julian came by with a tumbler of Scotch. “You looked like you needed it,” he said to me before cocking an eyebrow at Drew. “What’s going on with him?” “He’s worried the girl’s not coming.” “Aly?” Julian faced me. “If she’s here as your date, you should keep in mind that Mom is also here and if she catches onto what’s happening, she’s going to spend the night scheduling when you two start trying.” “You told her about your wife being pregnant?” Drew asked. “I did.” “She happy?” Drew grinned. “She’s over the moon,” Julian grinned back, making me note what a weird sight to see them getting along so well. I would’ve laughed over it if I weren’t so completely preoccupied. “Yeah, that’s the least of my worries,” I said to Julian. “Mom’s free to find out that I’m with Aly. Just as long as I’m still with Aly.” “What are you talking about?” “He thinks she’s not coming tonight, even though she’s probably just late. I mean what – you had a little fight?” Drew asked. “No. I mean maybe. I was just… away from the house for a bit,” I answered vaguely. I hadn’t told him about the past few days. It didn’t make sense to because he wouldn’t understand, and as much as I wish he could, neither would Julian. “Well, whatever that means, you need to breathe, Emmett. You have speeches to make tonight,” Julian reminded me. “And you look like a fucking mess,” Drew added. I stared at them. “Thank you. You guys are great,” I said, lasting about another ten seconds in their company before I excused myself. Maybe it was actually good that Julian and Drew weren’t normally friends, because teamed up, they were pretty irritating. Or maybe I was just losing it and seriously needed to get my shit together before introducing the keynote speaker. Even if it meant forcing Aly out of my head for a minute. The thought crossed my mind as I passed the bar and felt a hand on the small of my back. “Emmett.” I turned around to see Britt breathless from rushing over. “Hey.” “Hi.” She laughed at her flustered self, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear as she looked from her clipboard to me. “You alright, sweetie?” “Yeah. What’s up?” “Well, we’ve got Dr. Richards on deck in twenty, and the Kelley family will be standing beside him during the speech,” Britt said. “So wherever you are in about ten minutes, make sure I can find you because I need you onstage to introduce all five people. You have your notes ready, right?” she asked while using her eyes to direct her assistant to do something from well across the room. “Yes,” I said, patting my pocket to make sure they were there. “I do. Sounds good.” Britt eyed my tapping foot. “You sure you alright, Emmett? You seem anxious –despite the fact that you know I’ve got you covered, babe,” she assured me, nudging me to try to get me to laugh. “Come on, Emmett. Have you ever had to worry when I’m running your shit?” Warmth spread through my chest as I took a sip from my Scotch. “No.” “That’s right,” Britt beamed, rubbing my arm for a second before snatching it back. “Oop. Can’t do that now.” “Why?” “Because no one needs to see me getting all hot and bothered right now,” she smirked, eyeing me from under her lashes. “Not the most professional look in the world. Even if it’s common knowledge that you’re the sexiest man in the room.” I took another drink in response, letting it stay quiet for a second. Britt sucked in her bottom lip. “So… still haven’t gotten a hold of Aly?” “She’s running late.” “Very late,” Britt noted, eyeing the clock and drawing my eyes to it too. We were an hour and forty-five minutes. Damn it. Come on, Aly. “I’m going to step out to call her.” “Babe.” Britt caught my arm as I headed off. “You really don’t have the time for that. You have to be on stage soon, so if you’re not okay, we can take a minute somewhere and calm you down,” she said, stroking her thumb against my forearm. “Whatever way you need to decompress, you know I’m more than happy to help,” she added, dropping her voice. “In whatever way you need.” I could actually see the blood rush to her lips with the last sentence she spoke. I knew what she was getting at because she’d been dropping these same hints every meeting since we started planning this event. “What do you say?” Britt asked, her hair falling into her eyes as she tilted her head. I watched her step closer, my brain scrambling as she dropped her hand into mine, entwining our fingers. As I felt the warmth of her palm press against mine, I clasped my other hand over hers. And in a way that was both gentle and firm, I pried her fingers off me. “Thanks, Britt, but I’m good,” I said, catching the fire in her eyes before heading for John and Dev, two of my chairmen waving over to me at the other end of the bar. I excused myself through the crowd to get to them, though that process alone took another five minutes because of all the people I needed to say hello to. By the time I got to the guys, I managed my first real smile all night because they were laughing hard at the amount of people I was drowning in. “You’re used to Julian doing this part, aren’t you?” Dev snorted. “Yeah, but he deserves a break this year since – ” I cut off when I saw a flutter of rose gold and blonde at the top of the stairs. The guys followed my eye line and I heard John go, “Whoa.” I couldn’t blame him as my eyes caught first on that long skirt skimming the floor. It was the same one I’d held scrunched in my hands last week when I dressed and undressed that beautiful body in that fitting room. Lifting my gaze, my eyes finally locked on Aly standing at the top of the steps. And like a dam had broken, relief poured through me, carrying my feet to her before I even knew what was happening. “Welp. There goes our chance, Dev.” “Yep, we lost him. It’s over.” I grinned, ignoring the guys’ jokes as I passed them and several others to get to the stairs. I knew there were eyes following me, but all I could see was her. Unlike the day she’d tried the dress on, her hair was swept up, giving me a clear view of that gorgeous neck I just wanted to bury my lips in already. For once, she had jewelry dangling from her ears and it drew my eyes to them like candy. All I wanted was to grab her, kiss her and put my hands all over her body, but in a room full of people, I held back and settled on meeting her halfway up the stairs. True warmth flooded my veins when I saw that she was already smiling for me. “Emmett, I had an emergency with Evie and Mike – I’m so sorry I’m late.” “You’re here now. That’s all I care about,” I said, standing a stair below her so that we were for once the exact same height. Our hands were clasped already. I didn’t know when it had happened, but I knew that I needed it. Just the touch of her skin on mine made me feel almost completely at ease. It made all the stress trapped under my bones break up and disperse, freeing the weight in my chest, allowing me to breathe. It felt like I was inhaling long and deep for the first time in two days, and judging from the concern deepening in Aly’s eyes, she could see it – that in the past forty-eight hours, I’d been to hell and back. “Baby,” she said so softly it hurt. “What happened?” I’d expected the question but the way she said it made me heart ache. I was so fucking sure she’d be furious with me. I thought that even if she did show up, I’d have to spend an hour groveling before she finally spoke to me. But I should’ve known that she’d surprise me. She hadn’t stopped doing it since that night we found each other again. “I don’t… even know where to start,” I finally said, letting myself lean tiredly against her soft palm. “But I promise I’ll explain it soon. Not now, but tonight, when all this is over. Is that okay?” “Of course,” Aly nodded, letting me just gaze at her for a bit. Then she bit a shy smile back and peered past. “Emmett, everyone’s staring at us,” she whispered, barely moving her lips. “Yeah?” I chuckled. “Who?” “Everyone. Julian. Sara. Drew. Britt’s looking at me like she wants to eat my head.” “Yeah, ignore that.” “Your mom though. And my parents – oh my God. My mom’s face right now.” “I take it now’s not the time to ask for a kiss then, is it?” I laughed weakly, feeling all my exhaustion hit me now that I was with her. It was like my body knew that with her, I didn’t need to fake anything. That I could just relax. “Um, I feel like kissing now would be a big statement to everyone, which I’m not sure you want to make at an event of this caliber,” Aly giggled nervously, her big eyes flitting from the party back to me. But when she saw the look in my eyes, her own narrowed and she smirked. “You want it now, don’t you?” “Yeah. I have to be on stage for awhile and I feel like I need the re-up on energy.” She breathed out a laugh so sweet I wanted to taste it. “Fine,” she murmured before leaning forward to touch her lips to mine, brushing them gently against me before kissing away the last of my worries in that moment. It was a one, maybe two-second kiss, but it was just enough to bring me back to life. “Jesus. Was that Drew?” I snorted when I pulled away and heard a loud whoop behind us, followed by a small round of applause. “Yeah. That was definitely Drew,” Aly said with laughter in her eyes despite the red in her cheeks. “And now a very pissy Britt is coming to collect you for your speech, I think, so you should go.” “Fine,” I said, starting back down the steps. “But I’ll get you right after.” “You better,” she countered, giving my hand a tight squeeze before letting it go. “Because our parents are looking at me like they need
 an explanation STAT, and I’m not having those talks with them all on my own.” * * * I knew Mom had already gotten to Aly by the end of Dr. Richards’ speech because she locked frantic eyes on me from across the room and made such a fast beeline to me that it felt like I’d blinked and she was there. “Emmett, I feel like my heart is going to burst,” she whispered, clasping her hands over mine. I could already feel her emotions pouring over, but then Julian and Sara approached and she burst into tears. “Mom!” Julian frowned, looking briefly at me for explanation. “Happy tears!” Mom clarified, dabbing her eyes with her pinky and patting his arm. “They’re happy tears! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to startle anyone.” I managed a smile as the three of them broke into laughter, and I gave the obligatory groan as they pulled me in for a big family hug. With all of us smashed together, I somehow still managed to peer over Julian’s shoulder and catch Aly laughing with her mom at the bar. Her eyes crinkled when she laughed, and she looked so happy I couldn’t help but feel it myself. I was so completely fixated on how beautiful she looked that it took me a second to catch her dad standing next to them, already looking at me. When he caught my eye, he smiled big and waved excitedly, saying something to Aly and her mom before leading them over toward us. “Oh, Charlie’s coming over with Donna and Aly,” Mom said, her bejeweled hand blinding me as she reached up to dry the last of her tears. And in a flash, she had the poise of a princess again, wearing that beautiful smile of hers while warmly bringing the Stantons into our huddle. To my relief, the first ten minutes of conversation were devoted to Julian and Sara. Apparently, Sara knew the sex of the baby but hadn’t told Julian yet. “It’s supposed to be a surprise because she likes having the upper hand on me,” Julian smirked, breaking into a grin when he and Sara exchanged a look. Everyone laughed, our moms talked about names if it was a boy or a girl, and for a moment, everything felt good and breezy. But then Charlie spoke up. “Well, you know you can’t have that, Julian,” he chuckled, rocking back and forth on his heels. “It’s gotta be the man with the upper hand. That’s why it rhymes.” Christ. He had clearly taken a minute to come up with that dud, and somehow he still thought it was a good idea to say it. It was quiet for a second. Mom offered a polite laugh but I could see smiles falter all around the circle. “Anyway, can we please talk about the fact that you won my daughter’s heart?” Aly’s mom asked, giving me a teasing grin. “From what I recall, you two defined the word rivalry growing up.” “Rivalry implies there was competition,” Charlie interjected with a fat snort. “And I don’t think it was ever a close race.” For fuck’s sake. This was the exact kind of comment he used to make. It was never a direct hit because that meant he could get away with saying it. It meant he got to make his point enough that Aly felt like shit, but leave it vague enough to say, “I didn’t mean anything by it!” if someone asked him to clarify. Then he’d turn it on either Mom or Dad for “ruining a good time” by “getting all serious.” It was annoying and cowardly, and as I caught Aly’s eyes hit the floor, I decided enough was enough. “What do you mean by that, Charlie?” I asked. The circle fell quiet as he paused for a second, caught off-guard. Then he shifted his eyes around comically, giving a belly laugh and a big shrug. “What do you mean what do I mean about it? It was a joke.” “Well, can you explain it? Because ‘it was a joke’ seems to be your fallback line when you know you can’t back up something you said,” I remarked, faking a good-natured chuckle to throw everyone off. Charlie raised his eyebrows at me. It was the look he gave before he launched into some ball busting but tonight, nothing followed. He simply looked at me another second, frowned into his Scotch then stayed quiet for the next few minutes of conversation, which eventually veered to the topic of Aly’s restaurant. “Argh, my friends have all been! But I haven’t yet because Julian keeps waiting for a day when we can go with Emmett,” Sara said. “But I have seriously been craving a lobster roll like no other.” She made everyone laugh when she rubbed her belly. “I think baby’s got fancy taste. Like Daddy.” “Pretty sure that’s all you,” Julian snorted, kissing the top of Sara’s head as Mom started scrolling through her phone. “You know what I want? I’m trying to find the picture of that Bloody Mary you have, Aly. I saw it on this food website, and I took a screenshot, but where did it go?” she wondered, talking to herself at this point. “The Hail Mary – that’s what you’re famous for right?” “Well, it’s definitely that and the lobster roll,” Aly grinned. “They’re definitely the two most popular – ” “Thank Emmett for that one,” Charlie boomed. “You said he saved her liquor license, right?” he asked Donna before jabbing a finger at Aly. “Well, thank God for that, or you would’ve lost all your business.” Jesus Christ. “Easy,” Julian muttered, sensing my rage. “We’ve been out of the drink before,” Aly said. “And we still survived.” “Yeah, for one day, sure. But the whole summer? Kiss that restaurant goodbye. Just like I told ya.” The discomfort was palpable all around. I could feel it in the air but I watched Aly give a placid smile and hit right back. “Dad, we all know you though the restaurant was a bad idea, but it’s been kicking ass this whole summer, and it’s the food, not the liquor sales that have been driving so much business back to the warehouse. So lay off a bit, huh?” she grinned. “‘Cause ya seem a little jealous.” She topped off her burn with an innocent little shrug, like she was just playing around. I heard Julian’s snort just as I broke into a huge smile, because we both knew well that Aly had just turned the tables to give her dad a taste of his own medicine. As everyone laughed at her “ball busting,” Charlie tried to play it off. He was visibly embarrassed and fuming, but thanks to his ego, he wouldn’t say a word. He knew he’d come off looking sensitive and wounded and all the things he used to get on others for, so he just stood there in front of everyone – burning red and pretending to be fine the way he always forced Aly to do as a kid. It was pretty satisfying to watch.   ALY: Oh God ALY: Is it terrible that that was exhilarating?   I got Aly’s texts a little after Julian and I were pulled away by John to meet some guests. I smirked, looking up to find Aly at our table with Sara. I shook my head no but still sent a text back.   ME: That was fucking awesome. I hope it felt as good to say as it felt for us to hear. ALY: Absofuckinglutely ALY: My heart’s still beating kind of fast ALY: But anyway go do your thing! I’ll find you later   The last text took awhile for her to type up, but then it finally sent.   ALY: Love you   I grinned at the two words, returning them and peering up at her reaction before I returned to John and the guests. Thankfully though, Julian had pretty much taken over the conversation at this point. It was honestly what I preferred, so after another ten or so minutes, I dipped out to try and find Aly, but she and Sara were MIA, so I assumed they were in the bathroom and started toward Mom and Donna’s table. But on my way there, from the corner of my eye, I noticed Charlie sulking solo from the bar to the doors. “Leaving?” I caught up to him smoothly. “Should I get Donna?” He stopped on the second step and looked across the room at his wife. He made a face that said I don’t care before he looked at me. “Hey, I thought of a funny joke before,” he said. “What?” “You know how this is a fundraiser? I thought well, you’re being very charitable by dating Aly.” I clenched my jaw, determined not to let my blood boil over this idiot anymore. “I wouldn’t say that. I can promise you she’s not the lucky one, it’s me.” “Jesus, Emmett. You’re not gonna ask me for her hand in marriage, are you?” Charlie snorted. “Because you might want to think on that. You could be dating any one of these pretty girls here next week.” He pointed at every woman at the bar. “That one. That one. Blonde one. Tall one. Not everyone can be Emmett Hoult so don’t ask me something crazy right now. I don’t wanna hear it.” “Yeah, I’m not asking you for that,” I laughed, letting him laugh with me for all of a second before I went on. “I don’t need your permission for whenever I decide to propose. I’m going to eventually, and when I want to, I will. I just thought I should say now that if you can’t get past that famous ego of yours and treat Aly with the respect she deserves, then you won’t have a role in any of our lives,” I said point blank, watching the shock on his face slowly fade into fury. But since he couldn’t come up with anything to say, I went on. “She bailed you out, Charlie. She did everything you couldn’t do with that company, and if you’re hell-bent on pretending that never happened, then out of respect for my father, I’ll say goodbye to you here,” I finished, waiting a good few seconds to see if Charlie had anything at all to say. And though he did, it didn’t really count for much. “You’re not gonna wind up marrying her, Emmett,” he said. I sneered. It didn’t warrant a response, so after taking my last look at Charlie Stanton, I turned and walked away.            32  ALY    It was past midnight when Emmett found me sitting at the top of the steps, hair down, earrings off and chin resting in my hands as I watched the cleaning crew sweep through the ballroom. It looked like there were hundreds of empty champagne flutes on every surface, and it was funny sitting up there and watching Emmett try to help gather them up, getting about four flutes in each hand before the staff asked him to stop. “They don’t trust you. You look way too
 tired,” I teased as he made his way up to me, wearing a crooked little grin. Unsurprisingly, he managed to make tired look sexy as ever with his tux jacket off and his bowtie hanging loose around his neck. “Baby,” he exhaled, running both hands through his hair and thoroughly messing it up before he plopped down to sit on the stair below me. “Exhausted?” “Yes,” he groaned as I rubbed the back of his neck. “Ready to go home?” “Yes. But I have to wait for John and Dev to finish something. If you’re tired though I’ll call you a car first.” “No, I’d rather wait for you,” I said, lifting my long skirt and resting my legs over his lap. “I could use a couple explanations from you anyway,” I said, watching my words cast an instant cloud over his eyes. “I’m sorry, Emmett.” My heart beat a little faster at I watched his small smile fade to nothing. “I just need to know. Where were you the past two days?” When he struggled to answer, I swallowed the knot in my throat. “Were you with Drea?” “Huh?” He gave me a funny look. “No. Why would I be with Drea?” “I thought…” I stared out as the cleaning crew whipped the tablecloths off each round table. I was trying to recollect all of Evie and my theories but now they were a blur. “Aly, I promise you I’ve never dated Drea,” Emmett said. “I’ve only ever had one ex and it was a girl from college named Kristy. I don’t even remember if it was spelled with a K or a C anymore, it was that long ago.” I frowned, all the thoughts in my brain jumbling as I tried to remember what Emmett had said about this girl. “I thought you said that everything was great about you two. I mean when you ended, you were heartbroken enough to vow to never commit again,” I said, though I doubted my words when Emmett gave me that strange look again. “Did I interpret that wrong?” I asked. “I think yes,” he answered slowly. “Then why did you stop dating her?” Emmett swallowed hard as he looked down at his hands. “Because my mom was going through another break. And I had to be there for her to make sure she didn’t try to hurt herself again.” My eyes fluttered wide. I was immediately struggling to understand. “Hurt herself? What do you mean – ” “After Dad died, and after Julian moved away... things were bad.” Emmett cleared his throat as he wrung his hands. “And one morning… it was probably 6AM when Gram called me crying so hysterically I started driving right over in my pajamas because I couldn’t get words out of her. I had no idea what she was saying and at some point, she just dropped the phone.” Dread filled my chest. “What happened?” “My mom tried to kill herself.” My heart slammed against my ribs. “What?” “Julian doesn’t know,” Emmett said fast, looking up at me warningly. “And he can’t.” “What – why?” “Because he’ll blame himself,” he said, a slight panic in his eye. “He already blamed himself for Dad and he still does to this day. He’s gotten way better since meeting Sara, and she’s made a world of difference in the way he handles this part of his life, but I don’t want to risk the bad times coming back. He already won’t forgive himself for being gone for so long – he definitely doesn’t need to know exactly how bad things were when he was away.” “So he… never even knew your mom did this? You never called him when it happened?” “She wouldn’t let me. And Gram told me we should just do what we could to keep her calm,” Emmett said. “And I was eighteen when this happened – I didn’t know how to handle something like this. I know I made mistakes but I was learning along the way.” “Oh my God.” I felt my breath against my fingers as I held my hands to my face in total shock. “You were eighteen,” I realized, the information hitting me fully. “But… wait. I don’t understand how you drove over so fast. You were in college at this point and your mom was – ” “She still had the Upper East Side townhouse, but pretty much right after Julian left, she moved to be near me. She and Gram rented this little apartment near my campus.” “In Philly?” “Yes.” Wow. I had definitely never known that and I couldn’t imagine it. I’d grown up seeing Audrey Hoult as the whole city’s cool PTA mom. She lived for throwing parties and chairing fundraisers. She was the epitome of Manhattan glamour to me, so it was hard to picture her uprooting her city social life to move to Philly. Of course, it was even harder to imagine her attempting suicide. “She didn’t tell anyone, obviously. She felt guilty and ashamed that she needed her son to take care of her. She said that was supposed to be her job, so I shouldn’t have to be cleaning for her and checking on her. But I had to. Gram wasn’t doing the best at the time either, and if I didn’t cook for Mom, she wouldn’t eat,” Emmett said, bringing me back to the morning he’d surprised me with that beautiful breakfast. Suddenly I had a guess as to exactly when and why he’d taught himself how to cook. My gut wrenched as I imagined eighteen-year-old Emmett trying to plate the meals he made as beautifully as he could, just to entice his mom to eat. “I know. It’s a lot,” Emmett said, eyeing the look on my face. I nodded. It was. Audrey Hoult had always been my picture of poise. My mother’s too. We always went home on Sundays and marveled over her, whether it was her clothes, her cooking or her patience to dote on everyone around her. I could hardly process that at one point she was the one who was completely helpless – the one who needed to be cared for day and night. And by Emmett no less. As the cleaning crew started moving the tables out of the ballroom, we watched, quiet for a little. We went even quieter when the ambient music shut off to create a silence so deafening I caught Emmett grimace. I knew it was hard for him to talk about this. It was always hard to talk about the pain you kept to yourself. It was the kind that was so big, and buried so deep that you could never unearth just a little at a time. Once it was out, it had to all come out. And when it did, it shifted the way your thoughts had for so long sat in your head. In your heart. It made you face all the truths you liked to hide yourself from on a day-to-day basis. It rearranged your entire being, and I knew that well from the night I spoke to Emmett about Dad. “It’s hard to hear all this out loud,” he said. “Even from my own voice.” “I know what you mean.” I took his hand in mine, massaging it gently. “It makes you think about all the things you should’ve done instead. Or ways you could’ve made this easier on yourself at some point.” “Definitely,” Emmett murmured. “I know I should’ve told Julian at some point. But half the reason she fell into that place was because of him, and even after he came back for good, I didn’t know how to say so many years’ worth of shit to him.” “So when she has these breaks now… you don’t let him know even a little what’s happening?” “No. There’s no point in upsetting him when I’m the only one who can help. I’ve been there since the beginning. I know all her ticks and patterns. All the tricks to calm her down.” “How often does she have these breaks?” “Not as often now. They’ve been less and less frequent over the years. But in the beginning, there were times when I’d be living with her and Gram for weeks, maybe a month at a time because that was how long it took to pull her out of these places.” “So you didn’t do relationships because you felt like… you were on call for her? In case she broke down?” “Yeah.” Emmett gazed down at my hand, turning it gently in his to trace his fingers over my palm. “But… what if you’re away?” I asked, remembering how Audrey had thought Emmett would be abroad all summer. “I don’t go away for too long. Never more than a week at a time,” Emmett replied. “I know if something were to happen and she fell into one of these places, she wouldn’t tell me if I were on vacation. She’d want me to enjoy myself. But that’s not worth it because when I catch her early enough, I can talk her down before things gets bad.” “Right,” I said, though my heart was breaking as I listened to Emmett talk so casually about such an enormous responsibility – like it was just another normal aspect of his life. The life that was clearly not as charmed as everyone thought. “So that’s where you were the past two days,” I realized as Emmett nodded. “What triggered it?” “Sara,” he answered, clarifying when he caught my look of confusion. “Well not Sara. Her pregnancy.” I was still confused. “Your mom isn’t happy about it?” “Oh, she’s ecstatic. Julian said she cried for an hour straight,” Emmett said, giving a faint chuckle. “But I think… there’s a fine line between her being really happy and really sad. I think a lot of times when she’s over the moon about something, she misses my dad. And with Sara being pregnant, I know she’s just wishing more than ever for him to be here. We were all torn apart the day he died but look at us now. We’re rolling deep again,” he said, managing something of a smile. “We’ve got Sara now. We got a baby coming.” He eyed me. “I’ve got pretty good prospects in my life,” he said, smirking when I bit my lip. Gazing out at the empty ballroom, he nodded to himself. “It’s everything Dad wanted. And I know Mom’s just hurting about the fact that he can’t be here to see it.” “Of course,” I murmured, my heart twisting over all the pain the Hoults had quietly gone through. It was equally remarkable and heartbreaking, and it made me want to shake myself for every time I pictured Emmett’s world to be perfect. All those years that I’d ignored him over the hardship in my own life, he was dealing with an even bigger one of his own. “I wish I could’ve been there for you,” I said after several minutes of quiet. “I know things were weird between us, but I’ve always felt like you were my family. I know it’s hard to believe, but I don’t think I would have let you go through something like this alone.” “I know you
 wouldn’t have.” Emmett looked up at me. “You understood me and my family more than anyone else in the world.” “So I should’ve been there for you,” I whispered, my chest clenching tight as Emmett shook his head, pressing a soft kiss on my lips and using the same words he used on me before. “You’re here now,” he murmured. “And that’s all that matters.”            33  ALY    It was past 2AM when Emmett and I got into his apartment last night. After shedding our black tie attire, we’d basically collapsed into bed, crawled into each other’s arms and passed the hell out. Both physically and emotionally, we were spent, and since I knew I’d be late for work, I’d sent a text to Evie. And in the morning, I woke up to her reply.  EVIE: All good baby girl. Be as late as you want. Actually please take the whole day off for what I put you through yesterday. EVIE: For the record, Mike and I are okay for now so please don’t worry about me! I promise I’m fine. So enjoy your man in peace EVIE: And by peace I mean whatever dirty filth you get yourselves into this morning ;)  I laughed at her last text, but a frown still pinched between my brows – because I knew it was thanks to Emmett and me that Evie had gotten emotional about her relationship. As a result that night, she wound up calling Mike and I’d sat in my room while she fought with him in the bathroom for twenty minutes. The next day before the gala, I manned the restaurant alone while she took an emergency day to stay home with Mike. I knew they’d probably spent most of the day fighting and arguing, and I honestly wasn’t sure how much longer I could let Evie go on in this torturous limbo. But I wasn’t going to bring up her relationship with her till we were speaking in person, so after sending back a simple reply, I set my phone on the nightstand and peered over my shoulder at Emmett. My mouth curved into a smile as I studied his perfection. He was still asleep after I’d wiggled out of his embrace, and now he was lying on his back, one arm stretched over his head and the other resting on top of his chiseled abs. God, it was a hell of a sight to wake up to. The white sheets were a stark contrast to his tanned skin, and they were barely draped over him, which meant I could see every naked inch of that long, muscled body – except his impressive morning wood. Biting my lip, I reached for the sheet, making him stir when I whipped it clean off his body. “Mmph.” He moved but didn’t open his eyes, though I caught the slightest smile touch his mouth as he felt me crawl over to him. “I’m trying to sleep, baby, what are you – ah… holy fuck.” He shut up the second I put his cock in my mouth, swirling my tongue around his swollen tip and peering up just as he opened his eyes to pin them on me. His jaw fell as he watched me intently, raking his fingers through my hair and gathering it into a ponytail as I went from licking teasingly to sucking eagerly, my head bobbing up and down on his shaft. He didn’t take his eyes off me. He barely even blinked. Despite a heavy-lidded gaze, his attention was rapt on me, drinking in every second of me till he was growling for me to give him my pussy. After a ten-second wrestle for the top, I yelped, giggling as I felt him pin me to the corner of the bed. His chest was pressed hard against my tits, his cock driving so deep inside me that I knew I had his every last inch. He was absolutely buried inside me, and he seemed to want to keep it that way. His strokes were short and intense, and his lower abs were rubbing so tight against my clit that I could feel my pleasure mounting within minutes. “Oh my God, Emmett,” I breathed. Our bodies were completely joined, my pussy stretched to its limit and filled to the hilt. I gasped for breath but instead felt his tongue. It claimed mine as he grinded inside me, the weight his balls hitting my ass, the headboard rattling as our pace only grew faster. The second he squeezing my ass, spreading my pussy as he drilled inside it, I came. And as the euphoria spilled from my lips, I felt him twitch inside me. “Tell me you want it,” Emmett rasped, staring into my eyes. “Tell me you want my cum inside you.” “Give it to me, Emmett. I want to feel it,” I breathed as I watched every second of his hot release inside me. I kept my legs wrapped around him, kissing him through the last of his deep, throaty groan as he jerked against my body. It was intimacy like I’d never felt before. And for what felt like a blissful eternity, we stayed locked in that embrace, our breaths tangled, our hearts beating together, and our passion still thick in the air as we kissed the morning away. * * * Emmett let me hog the water for the majority of our shower, so I wound up hopping out first and heading downstairs to make us some lunch. I had to snort at myself for pausing at the bottom of the stairs, since I was unsure about whether to go left or right. It was funny – while Emmett’s summerhouse felt a hundred percent like home, his actual apartment was still a foreign place to me. Guess that could change in time, I thought with a smile on my lips. In a month, summer would be over and I’d be closing the doors to my restaurant till next year. Till then, it made sense for me to be in the city, closer to the warehouse that was open year-round. As I moved around the kitchen and grabbed bread off the shelf, I used my free hand to type into my phone. I was stupidly Googling the distance between the warehouse and this apartment, because I already needed to imagine what life might be like for Emmett and me after the summer. Less than forty minutes by train, I noted. Not the worst. It was fifteen minutes by car though, and knowing Emmett’s impatience, he’d probably wind up picking me up from there a lot. I grinned to myself as I imagined spending the coming autumn and winter in Manhattan, cozied up with Emmett in this apartment or wherever I’d end up renting. Though I definitely couldn’t afford an apartment in either Manhattan or Brooklyn without at least one roommate or two, and something told me that Emmett wouldn’t stand for that. But also, you could be getting ahead of yourself, I thought, though it didn’t stop me from continuing to fantasize – and so hard that I wound up forgetting about the toast I left on his skillet. “Oh shit!” I yelped when the fire alarm went off. “Crap!” I hissed, turning off the heat and running to the windows only to realize I had no idea how to open them. They were huge, floor-to-ceiling monsters that intimidated the hell out of me, so I wound up running around, searching for a solution till I noticed the office door sitting ajar, the window inside already cracked open. Oh God, oh God, oh God. Rushing inside, I pushed the window as far open as it went, spinning around to then search the room for a magazine or something so I could fan the alarm. My eyes locked fast on a sealed Manila envelope on Emmett’s desk, but just as I snatched it off, the alarm outside stopped wailing and my eyes landed on a stack of papers I couldn’t help but stare at. The second I processed the logo on the heading, my heart stopped. What… the fuck? My ears were still ringing as I dropped the Manila folder back onto the desk and picked up the stack of papers. I didn’t think – I just sifted through them, my pulse racing faster and faster as I saw the same logo on every sheet. “Should I call the fire department?” I heard Emmett call from the stairs. There was a laugh in his voice, and I caught the big grin on his face when I looked up to see him head into the kitchen, wearing a fresh white tee and blue jeans. But he paused when he saw that I wasn’t there, and when he turned to find me in his office, he stopped in his tracks. He stared at me, then the papers in my hands, and with a tight jaw, he took the few steps into the room, stopping just inside the door as he looked at me. “What are you doing, Aly?” “I was looking for something to wave at the alarm.” He took another step in. “What did you find?” he asked, his voice tight. I swallowed the golf ball-sized knot in my throat, dropping my gaze back down to that familiar logo before eyeing him again. “How do you know this company?” My question came out almost a whisper as I held up the paper in my hands. “This is the company that invested in me three years ago. So I could open my restaurant.” Emmett’s Adam’s apple bobbed. I mustered up all the patience inside me as I waited for his answer, but his silence was confirmation enough for what I’d come to suspect within seconds of recognizing that logo. God. I’d come to love that sleek blue mark. It reminded me of my big break – the pivotal change in my life, when I realized my dream had come true. I was so sure that day when Evie and I found out we’d landed the investment that all our hard work had paid off. But as I stood in Emmett’s office, I realized that the pride I felt that day was perhaps undeserved. “Were you the one who invested in my company, Emmett?” I asked, feeling numbness spread through my body from head to toe. “I’m not trying to fight, I just need you to answer me,” I pleaded softly, watching his chest broaden as he drew in a deep breath. “Yes.” Tears instantly stung my eyes as my stomach turned. I chewed back my trembling lip as I stood there quietly, dialing back to every memory of what I’d done to secure my dream of opening my restaurant. My heart pounded in my chest when I remembered that day – that miracle day when after dozens of job applications to the same company, Drea van Dahl finally emailed me back. I thought she was my blessing – a guardian angel who for some reason took me under her wing. I liked to imagine that she’d seen something special in me. That maybe my determination radiated so hard that she’d detected it, and of her own free will, made the decision to foster it. I always thought it was something in me. But that idea was
 crushed as I looked up at Emmett. “You never told me how you knew her.” “Who?” “Drea.” My throat was so tight I could barely speak. “So I need you to tell me now, Emmett. Tell me how you know Drea.” “We’re work acquaintances,” he answered, taking a long pause before he went on. “I’m an investor with The Victorian. Her restaurant group manages the bar at the top of that hotel.” “How long have you known her?” “Five years.” His answer mortified me, prompting tears to burn in my eyes. But I blinked them back, gathering myself just enough to ask one last question. “Were you the reason I got hired at Vandermark Restaurants four years ago?” I asked, my voice quivering. “Yes.” I let out a breath, one hand clasped over my mouth and the other hugging my body. “Aly.” My name came out mangled from Emmett’s lips. “I didn’t think I’d see you ever again,” he said, his voice tortured as he moved toward me. “I tried reaching out so many times, but you didn’t answer. You know I didn’t regret what I did, but I hated everything that happened after. I hated that your dad sent you away. I knew from your mom that you felt lost for so many years after, and I felt like I took so much of your life from you,” he whispered, close enough to me now to take the papers from my hands. I shook my head as he brushed my hair out of my face, thumbing the tears off my cheeks. I knew he wanted me to look him in the eye, but I couldn’t find the strength. I was rattled to my core, my limbs shaking as I realized that everything I knew about myself was not what I thought. Everything I’d prided myself on achieving was never actually that. None of it was earned – it was given. And by the boy who’d driven me to prove myself in the first place. “Emmett, why? Why did you feel the need to do this?” I asked weakly, finally letting him tilt my face up to look in his eyes. The tears that welled in mine spilled faster down my cheeks when I caught the look of torment on his face. “Because I wanted to fix things. I wanted to make up for all the pain I caused you. I knew you were still hurting from what happened, and I knew from both your mom and mine what you were up to here and there. I always kept an ear out for what you were doing because I wanted to know that whatever it was, you were happy. And that you’d moved on okay. When my mom told me you were having trouble getting hired, I asked where, she said Vandermark, and I made one call – that was it.” “It’s not as simple as you’re making it out to be,” I protested tearfully. “I thought these were all things that happened organically. I thought I had made these things happen. I thought Drea was my friend.” “She is your friend,” Emmett insisted. “A company like that isn’t going to hold onto an employee who isn’t working out for them. They’re too big and impatient for that, so when I say I only made a call, I promise you that’s all I did.” “You knew from Drea that I wanted to open a restaurant.” “I could’ve found out just as easily from my mom.” “You didn’t have to be the one to invest in me,” I countered. “No, I didn’t, but I wanted you to have everything you needed faster,” Emmett said. “I wanted to make your life easy for once. So you could just be happy.” I was numb all the way to my cheeks as I stared emptily out at the room. “Who knows about this?” “No one but my business partner,” Emmett answered fast. “Julian doesn’t know. My mom definitely doesn’t. Your dad will never find out.” I knew it was meant to be comforting but what he said only made me cry again because I just felt so damned stupid. Turns out nothing had actually changed. I was still in second place. I was still in Emmett’s shadow, everything in my life at his mercy. And even if nobody knew it, I did, and I wasn’t sure how the hell I was going to get past it. “Aly, please.” “I know this came from a good place, Emmett.” I forced myself to be steady as I spoke. “I know you did this because you cared.” He nodded, looking fearful for what I was about to say next, but I didn’t wind up saying anything. I had no words left. I felt speechless and helpless, and for the next hour or so, I floated through Emmett’s apartment trying to figure out my head. Sometime in the afternoon, I even tried to talk to him about other things, to test whether or not I could feel normal about him after everything I’d just discovered. I spent the rest of the day running those tests – even attempting a laugh at some point. But no matter what I did, and no matter what we talked about, I couldn’t shake the knowledge that the great turning point in my life had actually been a lie. I couldn’t feel anything but shame around Emmett, no matter what he said to me – no matter how sweetly he kissed me or held me. By evening, my heart had broken a million times over. Because while I wanted this man more than anything in the world, I knew in my heart that I could never look at him the same again. So in the night, while Emmett slept, I wiggled one last time out of his arms. Without making a sound, I cried as he rolled onto his back, still fast asleep as I slipped out the door.            34  EMMETT     Two Weeks Later  I was supposed to be watching the score with Drew, but all I’d really done for ten minutes was stare at the giant NYE logo on the floor. The Empires clubhouse had been remodeled last year, so now there were bright white logos on every shiny surface. There were also four massive flat screens playing the game, and the spotlights that glowed over each player’s locker made it look like a shrine to a king. So it was definitely comical to see Drew hunched over his, covered in dirt and muttering like a crazy person under his breath. He actually looked exactly like I felt – though he probably felt pretty shitty himself considering he was just tossed from the game. He’d been particularly amped for this one too, thanks to some trash talking from the other side. By the sixth inning, he’d racked up eight strikeouts and was still flirting with a no-hitter. But then he got ejected for throwing a punch at Tampa Bay’s shortstop, Trevor Martinez, and now we were both hanging out in the empty locker room, barely saying a word. Of course that changed when the commentators onscreen started talking about Drew. “You know, Joe, you look at this bases-loaded jam the Empires are in and you just wish Drew Maddox were still on the mound.” “Well, he should’ve controlled his temper.” “You’re not wrong about that.” “Shoulda, woulda, coulda…” “The fuck? That asshole charged the mound!” Drew defended himself to the TV, spewing a dozen variations of fuck as he watched a Tampa Bay double tie the game. “Goddammit, Griff!” he cursed his relief pitcher as I sat back with less of a reaction than I should’ve had, especially since the Empires were only a half game ahead of Tampa in the division. I gave an obligatory “damn” but it was too late and so half-assed that Drew shot me a weird look. “Are you pretending to be mad for my sake?” he snorted. In my head, I shrugged, but on the outside I was pretty sure I didn’t move much. “Jesus, dude. You’re starting to scare me. It’s like you’re catatonic.” “I met you here, what else do you want from me?” “I want you to look alive, motherfucker! Throw something! Be pissed with me! Come on, man!” He ripped his hat off his head. “What do I have to do to get you to be a person again?” “I don’t know,” I said. I genuinely didn’t. I was pretty much blank since that Sunday two weeks ago, when I woke up in the middle of the night to find that Aly was gone. I honestly should’ve expected it. I should’ve known she was going to leave because if I were her, I wouldn’t be able to look at me either. Yeah, I’d done everything out of love but I got how she’d feel humiliated. How she’d need time away from me. That was what she called it. “I just need some time.” But time meant distance too, apparently, because when I showed up at her work that same day, her friend Evie asked me not to come by again. The same happened the next morning, but it was followed by Evie putting her foot down. “It’s not right to make Aly dread coming to work every day for fear of seeing you,” she said evenly. And she was right about that. So after leaving the restaurant that morning, I went back to the house and threw a few things in a bag. I grabbed Ozzy’s favorite toys off the floor, picked him up from Julian’s and drove the two-and-a-half hours home to Manhattan. There was no way in hell that I’d survive being in the same town as Aly if I couldn’t see her, so I decided to cut my summer in the Hamptons short. That was about twelve days ago and every one since Drew had been trying in vain to pull me out of my funk. His go-to plan was always a night out in the Meatpacking District or Lower East Side, but I’d rejected every one of those invitations. I knew he’d try to push me to hook up with as many girls as possible, and as much as my dick missed human contact, I wasn’t really interested. Being away from Aly didn’t mean I wasn’t thinking about her. I was. Every minute of the day. I still wasn’t used to going to bed without my arm draped over her body. I didn’t even want to admit that I had pitifully tried hugging a pillow the first few nights. Spoiler alert: it didn’t work. On multiple occasions, I considered just going back to the Hamptons to see her, but the one time I decided to go through with it, I wound up spending two hours looking for the house keys. Turns out, Julian was behind that disappearance. In fact, he still had those keys. Dickhead, I thought, tuning Drew out as I scrolled through my phone and looked for last week’s exchange about the keys.   ME: When did you even get them? JULIAN: Swung by your house after the game on Sunday ME: You just let yourself in? JULIAN: Yes. You do it all the time at my house. ME: That’s diffjrnt ME: And this is fucked up I need my keys bac k JULIAN: You need to respect her need
 for space but more importantly you’re only thinking of going because you’re wasted right now. JULIAN: And the last thing you need is to make a drunken scene over her and land yourself another twelve years before you see her again.   “Tough love,” Drew said, reading over my shoulder. “What the fuck, dude?” I clicked my screen off and shot him a look. “What? I had to make sure you weren’t texting the girl.” “I’m not texting her.” “Good. You shouldn’t. ‘Cause if she doesn’t want you at your best, then she doesn’t deserve you at your – wait. I don’t know how that expression goes. What is it again?” I almost laughed. “What the hell are you talking about?” I asked as Drew walked back to his locker with his arms held out. “I don’t fucking know, dude!” he said, plopping back down in his locker. He picked his hat up off the floor and plunked it backwards on his head. “I’m trying to say what people say when someone gets dumped, but I don’t even know why you two broke up, so I’m just… saying shit, who knows. Leave me alone. I got ejected from the game.” I snorted. I had to feel a little bad for the guy. He had no idea how to help because I wouldn’t tell him why Aly left. I couldn’t. I still planned on keeping my investment in her restaurant a secret. That was the deal since day one and it wasn’t going to change. “Hey,” Drew said after awhile. “You should come out with me tonight.” “I don’t think so.” “My ass. You can’t keep saying no when I invite you out. It’s for your health.” “Really.” “Yes. You can’t sulk over a girl for the rest of your life. That’s gonna kill you.” “It’s been two weeks. I think it’s pretty fair if I take a little longer than that,” I said. “I don’t expect you to fall in love again. I’m just telling you to get laid. It’s good for the soul,” he said right before jumping to his feet and howling over something that happened on TV. “Yes! Hell yes!” Drew growled like a beast, pounding his chest three times before pointing at me with such a crazy look on his face that I laughed. “That, my brother, was a sign. That three-run fucking homer was a sign that you need to come out tonight. End of story. Period.” “Yeah?” “Yeah! That Instagram girl I’m seeing – she’s got a sister you might be interested in. A sister or a friend. It’s one or the other.” “Do you even know this girl’s name?” “Yeah.” “What is it?” “Babe.” “That’s what you call her. That’s not her name,” I snorted. “Well, it still works, so what’s the difference?” Jesus. I wasn’t sure if I was annoyed or amused with Drew, but I definitely wasn’t feeling great about going back to the late-night life I used to live with him. “Awesome. She just sent me a picture of her sister,” he said out of nowhere. “What? Why would you ask her to send you a picture of her – ” I leaned back when Drew came over and shoved his phone in my face. “Awesome. Very cute. Now get your phone out of my face,” I said, though when he immediately obliged and walked away typing on his phone, I got suspicious. “What are you doing?” “I told her you think her sister is awesome,” Drew grinned when he sat his ass back in his locker. “And she said she’s excited to meet you, so get excited, asshole. ‘Cause we’re going out tonight.”            35  ALY    Thanks to the lumpy bed at the motel, and the second job I’d picked up to pay for it, I was back to running on fumes. I’d been away from this life for so long that it took awhile to settle back in. I’d genuinely forgotten what it was like to be so tired at work that my face felt numb, like I’d spent the morning at the dentist’s. I had gotten so quickly spoiled living in a big, beautiful house and sleeping on a big, heavenly mattress. The overnight change from luxury to dead flies stuck in fluorescent lights was jarring to say the least. But I didn’t have a choice. I was in survival mode, and I just needed to get through the summer. I needed to get through six more weeks by busting my ass at my night job, nabbing that nightly two hours of sleep and giving it my all at the restaurant every morning and day. It was probably going to come close to killing me, but if it meant I’d close out the season with good sales and better press, then it was worth it. I was pretty sure of it, but Evie wasn’t quite as convinced. “Please. Please stay over my house tonight. Mike said yes. I talked to him about it all night yesterday, so please,” she begged this morning, trailing me around the kitchen with her hands clasped together. “You can’t operate on two hours of sleep for the next month-and-a-half.” “I did it before I wound up moving into his house.” “Yeah, but you only had one job then. Two jobs with only two hours of sleep a night is different, and that difference is you collapsing one day in the middle of this kitchen.” “Evie. It’s really not that bad. The job is easy and the motel is nice.” “Then why haven’t you told me where you work or invited me to the motel?” “Because,” I sassed, leaving it at that. I was giving Evie a lot of those answers lately and she was pretty unamused by it. Hands on her hips, she narrowed her eyes at me for a second. “Well, since you don’t work your sketchy second job tonight, will you at least come over to hang out?” she asked. “If I do, are you going to slash the tires to my car while I’m in the bathroom or something?” I asked. “Dude, no.” Evie rolled her eyes. “I’d obviously get Mike to use the tire jack so he could remove them properly.” “Haaa.” “I wouldn’t want you to have to replace them! Do you know how much tires cost?” I snorted, forcing myself to goof around with Evie for the rest of the shift because I couldn’t let her catch on to how completely exhausted and empty I felt inside. It was hard to even be in the restaurant without thinking about Emmett. Honestly, it was hard to be anywhere without thinking about him. I had never been more angry, grateful, betrayed and heartbroken over someone in my life. I had never felt this many conflicting feelings at once and at night, it generally resulted in frustrated tears as I lay restless in bed. And on the darker nights, I boiled in anger about how I would never be able to be fully proud of myself – to feel like I’d grown up and gotten past everything on my own. I’d question why Emmett felt the need to do what he did, and I always wound up getting stuck on this theory that he just wanted to clear his conscience. So yeah, nights weren’t great for me these days. And for that reason, I was kind of grateful for the shitty second job. Aside from the fact that it earned me enough to leave me some savings, it was physically demanding to the point of leaving me so tired, achy and sore that within twenty minutes of being in bed, no matter how dark my thoughts, I’d fall right asleep. No sex or dancing needed. * * * I spent the night at Evie’s because honestly, the motel “suite” was a deeply depressing box of a room where I spent way too much time telling myself that the thing on the wall was dust and not a spider. My intention was to leave by 9PM, but then Evie force fed me wine so I couldn’t drive, and now the plan was to crash on the couch after Mike finished watching the Mets game. It wasn’t ideal. I felt pretty darned awkward for a hot second, because I could hear the two of them hissing about the matter of my crashing tonight while they were in the kitchen. I heard him say the words “this tiny apartment” and knew he didn’t want me around. But miraculously, at the end of their whisper-yell fighting, I heard Evie giggle. “You’re so stupid,” she murmured. It was silent for a few seconds and then I heard the sound of a kiss. And when Evie returned to the bedroom, she did so with a grin. “He said it’s totally cool that you stay, and if you don’t believe me, he even offered us his pint of Ben and Jerry’s,” she said gently before doing a volume one-eighty and screaming out the door. “Mike!” “What?” “Tell Aly you said we could have your ice cream!” “I said you guys could have my ice cream! Enjoy!” “See?” Evie smiled sweetly at me. I snorted at her and said something else about her spiking my drink before we went back into our tired, wine drunk pastime of lying on our backs and scrolling through our phones side by side. “I really think we might be better now. After the last fight,” Evie said quietly. All night, here and there, she’d been defending Mike to me. She knew that after the drama they went through three weeks ago – right before I had my own massive drama – I was wary of their relationship. I felt like all she got out of it was torment and heartbreak. I hated seeing her constantly having to mask her emotions around me. But somehow, in recent weeks, the tables had turned and now Evie seemed genuinely breezy for once while I was constantly pretending to be fine. Of course, as good as my act was, it didn’t work on her. “Do you mind that I told Mike that Emmett was our investor?” Evie asked a little while later. I turned my head to look at her. “I don’t know. I think I do,” I said truthfully. “But mostly because I’m paranoid that the wrong people will find out that Emmett Hoult funded my career. I know you had to tell him. He’s your fiancé and I know he won’t like, randomly call up my dad and spill the beans,” I said, trying to laugh but failing in my attempt, because just the suggestion of that idea made my stomach twist into knots. “For what it’s worth, he thinks Emmett was just trying to be a good guy.” I chewed on the corner of my mouth. “I know. But it doesn’t change the fact that I’ll never be able to look at my own achievements without having to credit him,” I said. “And I just want something of my own for once.” “Well, if it makes you feel better, Emmett Hoult is also my investor, and I don’t feel any less proud of myself for what I’ve achieved,” Evie said while scrolling through some exceptionally good-looking dog’s Instagram feed. “Granted I don’t have the same history you have
 with him, but if you can somehow forget that for a second and pretend he’s just some faceless investor like we initially thought, we did do a shit ton of work on our own. Having money doesn’t mean you can just make a business happen. You have to have a good idea and you have to know how to use it.” “Uh-huh,” I said. “He also had Drea van Dahl hire me when I didn’t necessarily deserve it.” “So what? It’s like... weird nepotism. He was basically giving you a taste of all the privilege he himself has had in life,” Evie argued. “He missed you, Aly. He couldn’t take care of you in person, so he tried to do it from afar. That’s what people are supposed to do when they love you. They do whatever they can to make sure you’re okay.” “Well, he didn’t love me yet then,” I pointed out. “This was four years ago that he got involved in my life. I think he probably just had too much time and money on his hands, he heard I was having trouble, and he just dunked some money in me to relieve his own conscience.” “Holy crap, you are cynical. Can I get you more wine?” “No, Evie. We have work in seven hours and we can’t be hung over.” “Then will you please just look at this video of a dog cradling a baby? My mom just posted it on my wall and it’s making my ovaries do things.” “Fine,” I snorted. And for the rest of the night, I watched animal videos with Evie on Facebook. When Mike was done with the game, he came in to sleep and we did a little exchange. He and Evie set out sheets and pillows on the couch to make it like my cozy little bed, and as they slept, I lay awake and stared sleeplessly into the dark room. I did that for about thirty minutes before grabbing my phone and looking for entertainment on my apps. But I’d just explored every last corner of Instagram with Evie, and I didn’t have Twitter, Snapchat or Facebook, so I – Wait. Well. I did have Facebook but I’d deactivated in college. It was basically now just a time capsule of the person I was right after that one year in boarding school – right after I’d moved away from Emmett, and right before I’d met my darling Evie. It was probably a terrible idea, but before I knew it, I was navigating to that blue homepage I’d gone so long without seeing. After trying to figure out Facebook on mobile without downloading the app – because that would make my bad decision far too real – I reactivated my old account. Holy shit. I must’ve looked crazy with the glow of my phone illuminating my wide eyes in that dark room. But I couldn’t help my instantly voracious scrolling, because it was suddenly hundreds of names I hadn’t seen in a decade, and so many pictures of faces that looked familiar yet completely different. “Oh my God.” Timmy Whitman had a kid now. Whaaat? Daniela Valenti totally did end up dancing for the New York City Ballet. Not surprising – still amazing. Rochelle Sumner was married, of course, and Erica Janney was now Erica Janney-Coleman because apparently she’d married Matty Coleman? Which meant he was straight? What the fuck was the world? “This is crazy,” I whispered aloud, covering my mouth to suppress my giggles because I was actually having way too much fun. I didn’t even care when I’d accidentally liked a few pictures I hadn’t meant to because there was so much going on, and so much to be distracted by. It wasn’t till I got to my messages that my smile fell because I noticed Emmett’s name at the top of my inbox. The message was unread and judging from the date, it was from the week after his dad’s funeral. My heart thumped. Fuck. I stared at the screen, my throat already closing up. No. I couldn’t do this right now. I couldn’t feel that storm of love and empathy for him again, because it hurt too much. It had hit me multiple times in the past few weeks, but it never ended in anything but me remembering that I couldn’t look at Emmett the same again. That I couldn’t keep doing this to myself – leaving him behind then returning only, only to leave once again. Neither of our hearts were equipped for another round of this. I was sure of it. So without thinking, I slid my phone across the floor, watching its glow travel halfway to the kitchen. It sat there for a minute, casting a blue light onto the ceiling that made me think of Emmett. But finally, it shut off and after another hour of lying awake on that couch, I did the same.            36  ALY    I was on my fourth cup of coffee by noon the next day, but I reasoned that I deserved and needed it since I was scheduled to close at my other job tonight. That meant I’d be up for another fourteen hours at least, so despite Evie’s look of concern as I headed for the coffee machine, I went for it. “I’m guessing your other job doesn’t require a steady hand?” she snorted as she watched me down another eight ounces of pure caffeine. “Oh, it totally does, but it’s more important for me to be awake there than it is for me to steady,” I said, though that was definitely a lie. My boss almost sent me home during one of my first few nights of shakiness. I wasn’t caffeine-loaded, I was just nervous and when I shattered a martini glass in front of VIP guests, she told me to get my shit together or go home. Another bad decision in the books! I thought as I continued chugging my coffee. I wasn’t usually so jovial when I thought about my poor life choices, but this was basically me in do or die mode. I had to smile to try to convince myself that I wasn’t slowly dying inside despite the poor sleep, the nonstop work and the never-ending thoughts about Emmett. After reactivating my Facebook last night, I’d done another stupid thing this morning and Googled Drew Maddox. I’d been doing it periodically to see if any stories about his nighttime escapades would include pictures of him with Emmett. I knew they had to be out together. Drew was Emmett’s fellow party animal before I moved into his summer home, and there was no way in hell they hadn’t resumed their late-night lifestyle in the past three weeks. So all I needed to send myself in a tizzy this morning was a headline that screamed MADDOX SCORES SWIMSUIT MODEL DURING BOYS’ NIGHT ON THE TOWN! The only picture included was one of Drew leaving a club with some gorgeous brunette, but the article did mention that he had “three buddies in tow” and now I couldn’t stop imagining another girl’s hands running down Emmett’s washboard abs. I couldn’t stop imagining those low, sexy groans of his when he got his hands on a pair of tits, and that resulted in me taking a break in the office by 2PM – which meant ten minutes of me resting my head in my arms on the desk while begging myself to stop thinking about him. I was halfway through my break when Hannah knocked on the door. “Aly?” I lifted my head. “Yes?” “There’s a lady at the raw bar who asked if you were working today – she said she’s an old friend from high school?” I sat straight up. “What?” “She said – ” “Sorry! You don’t have to keep talking through the door, I’m coming out!” I knew I looked as confused as possible when I came out because Hannah kind of giggled and said, “Breathe. She seems nice,” as she walked with me through the kitchen and then out to the dining room. All I needed was one glance at the bar to know who I was looking at. My instinct was to grin. “Kelsey?” I said, my eyes wide as I watched that head of bright red hair turn around. “Holy shit! You look so different!” she gasped right away, clasping both hands to her mouth. “You do too!” The next few minutes was comprised of squealing and hugging and pulling back from our hugs in shock to note another different thing about each other’s appearances. After introducing Kelsey to Evie as my best friend from high school, I finally thought to ask why the heck she’d decided to show up this morning. “Well, I saw you back on Facebook for the first time in forever!” Kelsey laughed as Evie and I rounded the bar to talk to her from the other side. “You liked a picture of my cat!” “I did?” “Yeah! But maybe you didn’t realize it was me? I changed my name to initials so my employers can’t find me,” she snorted. “But yeah, I saw that notification and was like, ‘whoa. Blast from the past.’ And your profile didn’t have any new info on it so I may or may not have Googled you and found a bunch of articles about this place – which is amazing by the way. Holy shit, woman! What’s this about the lobster roll and the Blood Mary?” “The Hail Mary, and I’m going to make you one now – you’re gonna love it,” Evie said with a grin that grew to a hearty laugh when a few minutes later, Kelsey took her first sip. “Holy crap. This is strong. It’s a good thing you include a meal with it so I don’t get immediately shitfaced,” she said, popping the poached shrimp into her mouth while plucking the lobster claw off the side of the glass. “But do you like it?” Evie asked. “Oh, I’m definitely gonna need another one in two minutes.” Evie grinned at me with a thumb pointed at Kelsey. “I like her,” she declared shortly before the lunch rush rolled in. And for the rest of the afternoon – between managing the restaurant, solving server dramas and making sure tables were happy – I checked in on Kelsey, catching up with her a minute or two at a time. Apparently, she lived on Long Island now with her husband and her deeply spoiled cat. She worked in insurance but got to do so from home, so much of her time was also spent selling homemade jewelry on Etsy, and she still kept in touch with some of our old friends from high school, but mostly not. “I actually cut out some friends by senior year because of how shitty they were about the thing with you and… that asshole,” she said, finishing her sentence with a grimace as she eyed me. “Sorry. Should I not be talking about that?” “Mr. Scott?” I asked. “Oh, I don’t care. He’s not really a big deal to me,” I said truthfully. In all honesty, I barely thought of my old English teacher. Whenever
 my mind visited that part of my past, it thought mostly of Emmett, and judging from the way Kelsey went quiet, she could tell. “Should I get going? You guys are busy,” she said suddenly. “Oh God, stop. No. You’re fine,” I reassured her. “If I look out of it, it’s because I didn’t get much sleep last night.” “Well, yeah, you were trolling Facebook at 2AM,” she teased just as Evie rounded into the bar to make a cappuccino. “Though in your defense, if I reactivated my Facebook after more than ten years away, I’d have stayed up the whole night stalking the shit out of people.” She sipped on the last of her drink. “I mean I still do that, actually.” “Really?” Evie giggled. “Me too. I still stalk like, people I hooked up with once when I was a sophomore.” “Same. Though the hook-up I still stalk happened my junior year…” Kelsey said, trailing off as she watched me process what she was saying. “Am I allowed to talk about Emmett Hoult, or no? Because I did run into him a few years ago… and we may or may not have talked about you.” My eyebrows lifted as a gasp ripped from Evie’s throat. “Oh my God – spill!” she hissed almost demonically. Kelsey bit a grin back but looked at me first. “First things first, can I just say that I’m sorry I hooked up with him back then when you told me not to?” she asked, laughing sheepishly at herself. “I mean I’d literally watched a bunch of our friends lose their minds after hooking up with him once and never getting to talk to him again, and I still did it.” “I mean who could blame you?” I shrugged, the topic of Emmett making me feel dead inside. “He was gorgeous. He was the one all the girls wanted.” “True. Though I don’t think I ever told you the drunken shit he said to me the night we hooked up. I was too heartbroken that he was ignoring me, just like I knew he would,” Kelsey snorted, rolling her eyes at herself. “What’d he say?” Evie asked, abandoning the cappuccino she was making to hover over the counter. “Well, we were in Greg Barton’s bedroom, and Emmett was all drunk and just laughing and groaning and hesitating to kiss me. He kept saying, ‘This one might really fuck up my chances in the future, ‘cause you’re her actual best friend.’” I wore a blank look as Evie gasped again. “Yeah,” Kelsey said, nodding at whatever shocked look Evie was wearing on her face. “Well, fuck me! That means he was always in love with Aly!” she whispered furiously as Kelsey smirked and shrugged. “I mean I think so. Pretty sure everything he did back then was to get your attention, Aly. He just didn’t know what he was feeling because teenage boys are stupid. Almost as stupid as teenage girls,” she said, jabbing her thumb at herself. “Anyway, less juicy story – I ran into him a few years ago and asked if he’d seen you because you weren’t on Facebook anymore and you have like, no social media. And he said he hadn’t, but he heard you were doing good and that was all that mattered to him. The end,” she said, giving another shrug as if to say sorry that was boring. I shook my head as if to say it wasn’t. Because for some reason, that story resonated more with me than the other one. Or maybe just as much. I wasn’t entirely sure why, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it even as Evie engaged Kelsey in a discussion of her brand new theories about Emmett. I was still thinking about it even after the lunch rush, so while Evie and Kelsey chatted at the bar, I excused myself to the office to go back on Facebook. I sank into my chair, kicked off my shoes, and hugged my knees to my chest as I forced myself to return to my inbox and finally open Emmett’s message from ten years ago.   Hey. I know you’re not gonna read this because you haven’t read any of my messages but you haven’t blocked me yet either so whatever. I don’t really have anything important to say. It’s just Sunday and we’re all at my parents house in the city for the wake, and everyone just left but your mom and dad are still here. Your mom said you were sorry you couldn’t make it because school’s been crazy but she made a “yea we both know she’s lying” face which would’ve been funny if it didn’t kind of feel like shit.  But I get it, Aly. If I were you I think I’d probably hate me too so I get it. Please feel free to keep ignoring me - I’m just going to keep typing here though because it feels better.  It’s just weird being in this house on a Sunday with my mom and your parents because I keep getting up to look for you but you’re not here. And I keep thinking I hear my dad yelling for me to come downstairs but he’s not here either. Not really at least. It’s crazy. Everything’s just so off and I feel like I’m going nuts, like I’m the only one who notices it or cares. Mom hasn’t talked to Julian in days. I’ve never seen her like this before and I wish you could be here and see it so you could help me figure out if this is normal for what’s going on right now, or if I should be worried. I don’t know no one ever believes me but I just have this bad feeling like it’s not over yet - like Dad is gone and everything is shit right now but there’s more coming and I can feel it. I swear to God if you were here you’d agree with me. I really  just wish you were here, Aly. I know that’s stupid to say but I miss you like fucking crazy and I can’t talk to my friends about family stuff. They don’t get how we are but you do so that’s why I’m talking to you like this. You’re not actually here but you’re still better than them. Anyway if for some reason you read this I just want to say again that I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I didn’t know he was going to send you to boarding school and I already told you how I tried talking him out of it but that was  three messages ago. I just don’t know how to fix things. Everything’s fucked up right now and I just want to talk to you because believe it or not I haven’t stopped thinking about you since the day you left. And right now I’m pretty sure I need you.  Your parents are leaving now and I have to say bye but if you read this can you call me? Or just text me and end it with ‘don’t text me back’ and I won’t. If I’m not okay I just want to know that at least you are.  Miss you like crazy.  Emmett              37  EMMETT    I woke up Monday morning to incessant calling from Julian. I knew it was him because I assigned specific ring tones for him, Mom and Gram, and his was the sound of Ben Stein going, “Bueller… Bueller... Bueller?” I thought it was hilariously appropriate then, because I liked to tell Julian that that was what his big brother talks sounded like to me. But this morning it was gnawing at my soul so with a groan, I snatched my phone off the nightstand and answered with an irritated, “What?” “You’re still asleep?” “It’s 6AM.” “It’s 9AM. You’re looking at the clock upside down.” “Why did you call three times in a row?” “I’m at the stadium. I just had a front office meeting with Drew Maddox about his future with the team.” “What are you telling me this?” “Because he spent the last ten minutes trying to convince me to let him into your apartment so he could ensure you weren’t dead. Apparently he’s been calling you for a week now,” Julian said while typing at lightning speed in the background. “And you haven’t picked up.” “I’m alive. I just don’t want to go out with him after the last time he dragged me to a club.” “What happened?” “I don’t know. Everything?” Maybe my tolerance had gone down since I’d last gone out with Drew, because my one outing with him last week felt like fucking torture. I was completely bored and over-stimulated at the same time. The whole night felt like a revolving door of shots, clubs and girls who “just heard” that I’d gone through “a really bad breakup” and “that’s so sad – do you want a massage?” “Vague,” Julian remarked. “I can’t explain it but you of all people know that Drew can turn a normal situation into a crazy one in about two seconds flat.” “I believe you. But you might want to enjoy the time you have left with him, because he might be traded soon.” “What?” I jolted upright, making Ozzy jump. “Don’t tell him.” “What the fuck?” “Trust me, I’m against it. He’s a pain in the ass, but he’s going to go down as one of the best in the game, so know that I’m in his corner. I’m just letting you know that there have been discussions,” Julian said, holding the phone briefly away as he spoke to his assistant. “On the bright side, he said he’s been trying to get you to ‘look alive’ and you certainly sound it right now.” “Dude,” I said. “Don’t trade him.” “I’m trying not to. But do me a favor and pick up his next call. I can’t have him asking about my family during front office meetings.” “Fair,” I conceded as Julian moved on. “How are you doing this morning?” I stared back at Ozzy for a second. I had no idea how to answer. I’d just had my first real emotion about something besides her, so maybe that was a good thing. But the fact that it was about my best friend’s probable trade wasn’t great. “I’m doing,” I finally said. “Do you know if it’s a boy or girl yet?” “I find out tonight,” Julian said. I could hear a smile in his voice. “Sara’s been watching videos online about how people surprise their husbands with the baby’s sex, so I’m guessing she’s gonna pull some weird shit on me soon. I know in my heart it’s a girl, but I’ll let her do what she needs to do.” “It’s funny listening to you act like you don’t love it… you giant fuckin’ pile of mush.” “Yeah, you definitely sound alive again,” Julian said. “Anyway, I gotta get back to work. But I’ll let you know about the baby when I find out.” “Thanks. Talk to you later,” I said, hit with that mix of both happy and sad when I hung up the phone. It was a combo I’d been feeling a lot lately, mostly because I couldn’t quite enjoy anything without wishing I could do it with her. I couldn’t listen to Julian talk about Sara without wishing I had exactly what they
 had. I’d started trying the whole not-saying-her-name thing to see if it would help, but so far, it was almost making it worse. Honestly, despite the fact that I was faking normal a little better these days, it felt like I was at a breaking point. Almost a month later, and I wasn’t better. I was worse. So when Drew called tonight, I picked up the phone. And when he asked me to go out, I said yes. I’d survived the last time, and he could very well be traded next week, so it felt like I had to. Though I probably should’ve asked before he picked me up that night where the hell we were going.  * * *  “Drew. There’s literally the same location of this place in the city. Why did we have to go to the one here?” I asked, still in disbelief that I’d gotten into the car without knowing we were headed for the Hamptons. “Because this location is better. They pick all the hottest girls from their Manhattan location to work here for the summer,” Drew said, pointing at Iain as we headed for the doors. “Iain agrees with me.” “Sure,” Iain said, barely needing to nod at the bouncers at the door before they stepped aside to let us in. “Come on. Admit it. This place is awesome,” Drew said as we walked into the probably the last club on Earth that I wanted to be at tonight. The place was called Godsend and it was the same club where I’d found her at the start of the summer. Aly. Some girl had spilled her drink all over me on the dance floor, I’d gone to a bathroom to wash the stain out, and half a minute later, Aly walked out looking like a vision from my fucking dreams. It was a memory I’d actually forgotten about since I’d made so many with her after. But now that we were in this club, in the same place I’d first seen her again, I could see every moment of that night again. I could practically hear the sound of her breathy laughter from when I flirted with her in the bathroom, and within the first minute of sitting down, it was starting to tear at me. “Hey, man, don’t make that face, alright? There’s a girl here that you’re really going to like,” Drew yelled over the music. “You’re going to think she’s awesome!” “Right,” I yelled back. “Haven’t heard that one before.” “Look, I promise she’s gonna be your type, asshole. I knew it the second I spotted her when I came here last week,” Drew said, wiggling his eyebrows at me in a way I’d never seen happen on his face. “She’ll be here in a sec. She’s just gotta finish with that table over there first. See her?” I followed Drew’s eye line and let my gaze land on the bottle girl serving the round booth next to ours. She had her tray held up high next to her head, but I could see her high ponytail bobbing around while she talked animatedly with the table of guys who tried to play it cool around her. But I could see from the way they stared at her – from the way their eyes moved wildly all over her body – that they were fucking fixated. Shit, so was I. I hadn’t looked at anyone this way in what felt like ages, but her body was everything I wanted and missed. It was tiny and tight with perfect tits sitting high on her chest, looking like they could spill out at any second. “See?” I didn’t have to look at Drew to know he was grinning wide. He could see this girl had my attention and he was counting it as a personal victory. I would’ve turned to at least shoot him a smirk, but I was too busy watching the guy sitting closest to the her. As she leaned over to pour their drinks, he tilted his head, hanging damned near out of his booth to check out her ass. Little shit. Looking was fine, but staring like she was a zoo animal was fucking excessive. I was a second from pointing out the dickhead to Drew, but just as I did, the girl lowered her tray. And I processed Aly’s face just as the dickhead lifted his hand to slap her ass. “What the fuck!” he yelped before I could even process what the fuck I’d just done. I had him by the collar and I could feel his weight in my grip, but I wasn’t looking at him. My eyes were fixed on Aly in a little shot girl outfit that had me pissed off, turned on and feeling like my heart might jump out of my fucking throat. Christ. Those eyes. That mouth. Those tits and those legs. She looked sexier than I had the capacity to handle. I heard a thump and an “ow” as I dropped my handful of collar and floated over to her, studying every inch of the shocked look on her face. Fuck, I missed that. It was messed up and a little twisted, but I missed that stunned expression. I’d been staring at it all summer. When I said yes to being friends, when I caught her watching porn – when I made her come in the back of that car just by sucking her nipples. I missed that rush of blood to her lips, that shade of pink that bloomed in her cheeks. I missed how big those already big brown eyes got and I couldn’t wait to just fucking touch her. But the commotion around us faded into my ears as the asshole I dropped started dragging management over. And since Aly rushed off in a speechless panic, I picked my feet up and followed. I tracked that round ass of hers through the dense crowd, up a flight of stairs and right back into the room where everything started. I watched her rip out her hair tie, thrust both hands in her hair and spin around wearing a look like she was ready to chew me the fuck out. But within a second of our eyes being locked, tears sprang into hers, and before I knew it, her arms were wrapped around my neck, her body pressed against mine. I didn’t question it. I just grabbed her and held on tight, pushing her back as I crushed a kiss to her lips. Her mouth parted for my tongue as I lifted her onto the sink, standing between her open legs and squeezing her smooth thighs in my hands. I felt every part of me fall into place as I kissed her deeply, reclaiming those lips, that tongue and every inch of her that I’d been without for too goddamned long. “Aly, I fucking missed you,” I groaned as she locked her legs around me. “What…” I didn’t know which question to ask first. “What the fuck are you doing here?” I breathed out in confusion, making her laugh weakly through tears. “I needed to pay for the motel.” “You’re living in a motel?” I pulled away to look her in the eye. “You’re working both here and at the restaurant, and you’re living in a motel? Are you fucking crazy?” I whispered, resting my forehead on hers. “I had to.” “For Christ’s sake, you could’ve just lived alone in my house. I told Evie to tell you.” “I know, but…” She shook her had. “That would’ve been worse. I couldn’t be in there without you. There was just no way.” “I know what you mean,” I murmured, closing my eyes and shaking my head at how fucking good my body felt near hers again. For the first time in a month, I felt like I was myself again – awake and alive with red blood pumping through my veins. “Baby.” I exhaled when the adrenaline rush finally settled enough to let me speak. “There’s no way in hell I can let you keep doing this. You know that, right? Working here. Living there. It’s not gonna work. I need you to come home to me.” My heart beat faster because Aly said nothing, simply staring back at me as I held her face in my hands. “I know it feels like I took another thing away from you. I know it feels like I stole all your achievements from the past three, four years – but you need to know that you did all this on your own. If it weren’t me, it would’ve been someone else investing in you because you’re fucking brilliant. You’re smart and you’re passionate, and before I found my business partner, I promise you I invested in more than a dozen restaurants that closed before a year because they didn’t have your drive. The money doesn’t matter, it’s the love that does. So fine, maybe I took interest in your company because of you, but Iain did it because he knew you were a smart and unique and – ” “Oh God, just stop, Emmett,” Aly interrupted, closing her eyes and shaking her head. “Just save your breath. I’m already sold.” “What?” “I’m sold, Emmett. I thought I couldn’t live knowing what you did, but the truth is I can’t live without you,” she said, so breathless and bright-eyed I felt my heart coming to life. “I tried and I failed, and I know now, Emmett – I know that what you did was out of love because you’ve always loved me. And unlike me, you never stopped,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “Whether or not we wanted to admit it, we’ve been partners since day one. We knew each other inside out. We had each other’s back on those boring Sundays,” she laughed, running her thumb over my smile. “We understood each other’s lives like no one else did. We’ve always been a team. You just didn’t give up on me and I can’t hold that against you anymore. All the love and approval I spent my whole life chasing – I have that with you. I have everything I’ve ever wanted with you. It just keeps taking me too long to realize.” I couldn’t hold back the massive grin spreading my lips as I soaked in her words. “As long as you realize it now,” I murmured, feeling as if I were in some kind of incredible dream. The fact that we were in this familiar room didn’t help. It was like déjà vu, especially with the words she said next. “Let’s go, Emmett. I want you to take me home.”  * * * ALY  God, it’s good to be back. The thought crossed my mind just as the car rolled up in front of Emmett’s house. I smiled to myself because a month later, I still looked at this house and thought the word home. And I would’ve gotten on myself for being presumptuous, but just as we stepped into the foyer, Emmett wrapped his arms around me from behind, kissing the top of my head as he said, “This is where you belong.” And I had to agree. As far as homes went, save for the motel, I’d stayed the shortest amount of time here. I’d spent seventeen years at my parents’ house in Brooklyn. I spent a summer at Aunt Carla’s, ten months in boarding school, and
 four years in the same dorm building during college. And in the six since graduation, I’d only had three leases. I’d lived a lot of places, and all of them for much longer than I’d lived in this house in East Hampton. But it was here that I finally found myself. Where I’d made myself complete. “You have work in eight hours. Should we go to sleep?” Emmett asked as we both drifted habitually into the kitchen. I made a long hmm sound as I gave his question some thought. “I was thinking we could watch a movie to wind down.” “Really,” he smirked, trailing me over toward the living room couch. “What kind are you thinking?” “We could always finish the last one we started together,” I said, raking a grin between my teeth as Emmett took a seat and pulled me sideways onto his lap. I turned on the TV as I leaned into him, settling against his chest and exhaling in quiet relief as I felt that sense of warmth again. That unmistakable sense of home. Emmett chuckled as he watched me go back to HBO and click on that awful movie we’d watched together a few months ago. “If we watch this again, we should probably rewind a little so we remember what was happening.” “Any scene you have in mind?” I giggled as Emmett slipped his hand under my shirt and kissed just under my jaw. “I think you know.”            Epilogue  EMMETT     Two Years Later   I had dinner in the oven, Netflix cued up and my wife running late for our Thursday movie night. “Six-thirty, yes, promise – I gotta go!” Aly exhaled all in one breath when I’d called her to check her ETA. Then without the usual “love you,” she hung up. Which meant something was up. That much I knew. But I wasn’t going to badger her to tell me what it was. As mellow as we were in our married life at home, our lives outside our downtown apartment were hectic –Aly’s in particular. She was in the middle of finalizing her Manhattan location for the restaurant, which was set to be open year-round. She and Evie had been running around all month reliving the madness that was opening a brand new place, so I excused the fact that Aly was an hour-and-a-half late. Though she did finally pique my concern when she rushed home, a blur of blonde hair and pink cheeks as she kissed me, said hi to Ozzy, then rushed upstairs for a shower. “Baby. Everything okay?” I asked suspiciously, following her halfway up the stairs. “No! Just start the movie without me. I’ll be downstairs soon and everything’s fine!” she said, making sure to flash me a bright smile that made me snort in her face. “You realize you’re giving me no reason to believe you, right?” I called after her as she ran up to the bedroom. But once I heard the sound of her shutting the door, I turned around, exchanged a look with Ozzy and went to play some random show while I waited for her to come downstairs. But just as I hit play, the screen flickered to black and suddenly, I was staring at  YouTube video. No fucking way. My heart slammed when my eyes moved across the title of the video emblazoned across the bottom of the screen. BEST WAYS TO SURPRISE YOUR HUSBAND THAT YOU’RE PREGNANT! I took half a second to read the words before chucking the remote on the couch and storming for the bedroom. But before I could get halfway up the stairs, I saw Aly laughing her ass off on the top step, her hands on her belly as she watched me clutch my heart with one hand and the railing with the other. “Is this real?” I asked breathlessly, wishing I could help the giant grin on my face considering how serious this was. “Aly, you know you can’t mess with me about something like this.” “I wasn’t messing with you the first time, and I’m not messing with you now,” she giggled, that rosy pink flushing to her cheeks as she watched me come up the stairs. “You’re gonna be more than Fun Uncle in eight months, Emmett Hoult. You’re going to be a daddy.” “Aly.” There were tears in my eyes as I knelt on the step below her, letting her put my hand on her stomach. And from that touch alone, I saw everything. I saw the night I’d found her for the second time at that club. I saw the way she looked at me the night Sara gave birth – when she held baby Luna in her arms. I saw all five feet and two inches of her perfection the day of our shoeless beach wedding in the Hamptons. And I saw the life we had ahead of us – me, Aly and the newest addition to the ever-expanding Hoult family. It was joy greater than any I’d ever felt before, because in this home, with this woman, I had everything I’d ever wanted. I had the love of my life, the mother of my child and the exception to my every rule. Through thick and thin, we’d been together, and yes, it had definitely taken us awhile to get to this point. But that wasn’t what mattered. What mattered was the fact that we were finally here.  The End
