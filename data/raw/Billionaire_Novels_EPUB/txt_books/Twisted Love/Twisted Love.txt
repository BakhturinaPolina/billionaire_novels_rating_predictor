He has a heart of ice...but for her, he'd burn the world.





Alex Volkov is a devil blessed with the face of an angel and cursed with a past he canâ€™t escape.



Driven by a tragedy that has haunted him for most of his life, his ruthless pursuits for success and vengeance leave little room for matters of the heart.



But when heâ€™s forced to look after his best friendâ€™s sister, he starts to feel something in his chest:



A crack.
A melt.
A fire that could end his world as he knew it.



***



Ava Chen is a free spirit trapped by nightmares of a childhood she canâ€™t remember.



But despite her broken past, sheâ€™s never stopped seeing the beauty in the worldâ€¦including the heart beneath the icy exterior of a man she shouldnâ€™t want.



Her brotherâ€™s best friend.
Her neighbor.
Her savior and her downfall.



Theirs is a love that was never supposed to happenâ€”but when it does, it unleashes secrets that could destroy them bothâ€¦and everything they hold dear.

Ava






There were worse
 things than being stranded in the middle of nowhere during a rainstorm.
For example, I could be running from a rabid bear intent on mauling me into the next century. Or I could be tied to a chair in a dark basement and forced to listen to Aquaâ€™s â€œBarbie Girlâ€ on repeat until Iâ€™d rather gnaw off my arm than hear the songâ€™s eponymous phrase again.
But just because things could be worse didnâ€™t mean they didnâ€™t suck.

Stop. Think positive thoughts.

â€œAn Uber will show upâ€¦now.
 â€ I stared at my phone, biting back my frustration when the app reassured me it was â€œfinding my rideâ€, the way it had been for the past half hour.
Normally, Iâ€™d be less stressed about the situation because hey, at least I had a working phone and a bus shelter to keep me mostly dry from the pounding rain. But Joshâ€™s farewell party was starting in an hour, I had yet to pick up his surprise cake from the bakery, and it would be dark soon. I may be a glass half full kinda gal, but I wasnâ€™t an idiot. No oneâ€”especially not a college girl with zero fighting skills to speak ofâ€”wants to find herself alone in the middle of nowhere after dark.
I shouldâ€™ve taken those self-defense classes with Jules like she wanted.
I mentally scrolled through my limited options. The bus that stopped at this location didnâ€™t run on the weekends, and most of my friends didnâ€™t own a car. Bridget had car service, but she was at an embassy event until seven. Uber wasnâ€™t working, and I hadnâ€™t seen a single car pass by since the rain started. Not that I would hitchhike, anywayâ€”Iâ€™ve watched horror movies, thank you very much.
I only had one option leftâ€”one I really
 didnâ€™t want to takeâ€”but beggars couldnâ€™t be choosers.
I pulled up the contact in my phone, said a silent prayer, and pressed the call button.
One ring. Two rings. Three.

Come on, pick up. Or not.
 I wasnâ€™t sure which would be worseâ€”getting murdered or dealing with my brother. Of course, there was always the chance said brother would murder me himself for putting myself in such a situation, but Iâ€™d deal with that later.
â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€
I scrunched my nose at his greeting. â€œHello to you too, brother dearest. What makes you think something is wrong?â€
Josh snorted. â€œUh, you called
 me. You never call unless youâ€™re in trouble.â€
True. We preferred texting, and we lived next door to each otherâ€”not my idea, by the wayâ€”so we rarely had to message at all.
â€œI wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m in trouble,â€
 I hedged. â€œMore likeâ€¦stranded. Iâ€™m not near public transport, and I canâ€™t find an Uber.â€
â€œChrist, Ava. Where are you?â€
I told him.
â€œWhat the hell are you doing there? Thatâ€™s an hour from campus!â€
â€œDonâ€™t be dramatic. I had an engagement shoot, and itâ€™s a thirty-minute drive. Forty-five if thereâ€™s traffic.â€ Thunder boomed, shaking the branches of nearby trees. I winced and shrank farther back into the shelter, not that it did me much good. The rain slanted sideways, splattering me with water droplets so heavy and hard they stung when they hit my skin.
A rustling noise came from Joshâ€™s end, followed by a soft moan.
I paused, sure Iâ€™d heard wrong, but nope, there it was again. Another moan.
My eyes widened in horror. â€œAre you having sex
 right now?â€ I whisper-shouted, even though no one else was around.
The sandwich Iâ€™d scarfed down before I left for my shoot threatened to make a reappearance. There was nothingâ€”I repeat nothingâ€”grosser than listening to a relative while theyâ€™re mid-coitus. Just the thought made me gag.
â€œTechnically, no.â€ Josh sounded unrepentant.
The word â€œtechnicallyâ€ did a lot of heavy lifting there.
It didnâ€™t take a genius to decipher Joshâ€™s vague reply. He may not be having intercourse, but something
 was going on, and I had zero desire to find out what that â€œsomethingâ€ was.
â€œJosh Chen.â€
â€œHey, youâ€™re the one who called me.â€ He mustâ€™ve covered his phone with his hand, because his next words came through muffled. I heard a soft, feminine laugh followed by a squeal, and I wanted to bleach my ears, my eyes, my mind.
 â€œOne of the guys took my car to buy more ice,â€ Josh said, his voice clear again. â€œBut donâ€™t worry, I got you. Drop a pin on your exact location and keep your phone close. Do you still have the pepper spray I bought for your birthday last year?â€
â€œYes. Thanks for that, by the way.â€ Iâ€™d wanted a new camera bag, but Josh had bought me an eight-pack of pepper spray instead. Iâ€™d never used any of it, which meant all eight bottlesâ€”minus the one tucked in my purseâ€”were sitting snug in the back of my closet.
My sarcasm went over my brotherâ€™s head. For a straight-A pre-med student, he could be quite dense. â€œYouâ€™re welcome. Stay put, and heâ€™ll be there soon. Weâ€™ll talk about your complete lack of self-preservation later.â€
â€œIâ€™m self-preserved,â€ I protested. Was that the right word?
 â€œItâ€™s not my fault there are no Ubâ€”wait, what do you mean â€˜heâ€™? Josh!â€
Too late. Heâ€™d already hung up.
Figured the one time I wanted him to elaborate, heâ€™d ditch me for one of his bed buddies. I was surprised he hadnâ€™t freaked out more, considering Josh put the â€œoverâ€ in overprotective. Ever since â€œThe Incident,â€ heâ€™d taken it upon himself to look after me like he was my brother and bodyguard rolled into one. I didnâ€™t blame himâ€”our childhood had been a hundred shades of messed up, or so Iâ€™d been toldâ€”and I loved him to pieces, but his constant worrying could be a bit much.
I sat sideways on the bench and hugged my bag to my side, letting the cracked leather warm my skin while I waited for the mysterious â€œheâ€ to show up. It could be anyone. Josh had no shortage of friends. Heâ€™d always been Mr. Popularâ€”basketball player, student body president, and homecoming king in high school; Sigma fraternity brother and Big Man on Campus in college.
I was his opposite. Not un
 popular per se, but I shied away from the limelight and would rather have a small group of close friends than a large group of friendly acquaintances. Where Josh was the life of the party, I sat in the corner and daydreamed about all the places I would love to visit but would probably never get to. Not if my phobia had anything to do with it.

My damn phobia.
 I knew it was all mental, but it felt
 physical. The nausea, the racing heart, the paralyzing fear that turned my limbs into useless, frozen things
 â€¦
On the bright side, at least I wasnâ€™t afraid of rain. Oceans and lakes and pools, I could avoid, but rainâ€¦yeah, that wouldâ€™ve been bad.
I wasnâ€™t sure how long I huddled in the tiny bus shelter, cursing my lack of foresight when I turned down the Graysonsâ€™ offer to drive me back to town after our shoot. I hadnâ€™t wanted to inconvenience them and thought I could call an Uber and be back at Thayerâ€™s campus in half an hour, but the skies opened up right after the couple left and, well, here I was.
It was getting dark. Muted grays mingled with the cool blues of twilight, and part of me worried the mysterious â€œheâ€ wouldnâ€™t show up, but Josh had never let me down. If one of his friends failed to pick me up like heâ€™d asked, they wouldnâ€™t have working legs tomorrow. Josh was a med student, but he had zero compunction about using violence when the situation called for itâ€”especially when the situation involved me.
The bright beam of headlights slashed through the rain. I squinted, my heart tripping in both anticipation and wariness as I weighed the odds of whether the car belonged to my ride or a potential psycho. This part of Maryland was pretty safe, but you never knew.
When my eyes adjusted to the light, I slumped with relief, only to stiffen again two seconds later.
Good news? I recognized the sleek, black Aston Martin pulling up toward me. It belonged to one of Joshâ€™s friends, which meant I wouldnâ€™t end up a local news item tonight.
Bad news? The person driving said Aston Martin was the last
 person I wantedâ€”or expectedâ€”to pick me up. He wasnâ€™t an Iâ€™ll do my buddy a favor and rescue his stranded little sister
 kinda guy. He was a look at me wrong and Iâ€™ll destroy you and everyone you care about
 kinda guy, and heâ€™d do it looking so calm and gorgeous you wouldnâ€™t notice your world burning down around you until you were already a heap of ashes at his Tom Ford-clad feet.
I swiped the tip of my tongue over my dry lips as the car stopped in front of me and the passenger window rolled down.
â€œGet in.â€
He didnâ€™t raise his voiceâ€”he never raised his voiceâ€”but I still heard him loud and clear over the rain.
Alex Volkov was a force of nature unto himself, and I imagined even the weather bowed to him.
â€œI hope youâ€™re not waiting for me to open the door for you,â€ he said when I didnâ€™t move. He sounded as happy as I was about the situation.

What a gentleman.

I pressed my lips together and bit back a sarcastic reply as I roused myself from the bench and ducked into the car. It smelled cool and expensive, like spicy cologne and fine Italian leather. I didnâ€™t have a towel or anything to place on the seat beneath me, so all I could do was pray I didnâ€™t damage the expensive interior.
â€œThanks for picking me up. I appreciate it,â€ I said in an attempt to break the icy silence.
I failed. Miserably.
Alex didnâ€™t respond or even look at me as he navigated the twists and curves of the slick roads leading back to campus. He drove the same way he walked, talked, and breathedâ€”steady and controlled, with an undercurrent of danger warning those foolish enough to contemplate crossing him that doing so would be their death sentence.
He was the exact opposite of Josh, and I still marveled at the fact that they were best friends. Personally, I thought Alex was an asshole. I was sure he had his reasons, some kind of psychological trauma which shaped him into the unfeeling robot he was today. Based on the snippets Iâ€™d gleaned from Josh, Alexâ€™s childhood had been even worse than ours, though Iâ€™d never managed to pull the details out of my brother. All I knew was, Alexâ€™s parents had died when he was young and left him a pile of money heâ€™d quadrupled the value of when he came into his inheritance at age eighteen. Not that heâ€™d needed it because heâ€™d invented a new financial modeling software in high school that made him a multimillionaire before he could vote.
With an IQ of 160, Alex Volkov was a genius, or close to it. He was the only person in Thayerâ€™s history to complete its five-year joint undergrad/MBA program in three years, and at age twenty-six, he was the COO of one of the most successful real estate development companies in the country. He was a legend, and he knew it.
Meanwhile, I thought I was doing well if I remembered to eat while juggling my classes, extracurriculars, and two jobsâ€”front desk duty at the McCann Gallery, and my side hustle as a photographer for anyone who would hire me. Graduations, engagements, dogsâ€™ birthday parties, I did them all.
â€œAre you going to Joshâ€™s party?â€ I tried again to make small talk. The silence was killing me.
Alex and Josh had been best friends since they roomed together at Thayer eight years ago, and Alex had joined my family for Thanksgiving and assorted holidays every year since, but I still didnâ€™t know
 him. Alex and I didnâ€™t talk unless it had to do with Josh or passing the potatoes at dinner or something.
â€œYes.â€

Okay, then.
 Guess small talk was out.
My mind wandered toward the million things I had to do that weekend. Edit the photos from the Graysonsâ€™ shoot and, work on my application for the World Youth Photography fellowship, help Josh finish packing afterâ€”

Crap!
 Iâ€™d forgotten all about Joshâ€™s cake.
Iâ€™d ordered it two weeks ago because that was the max lead time for something from Crumble & Bake. It was Joshâ€™s favorite dessert, a three-layer dark chocolate frosted with fudge and filled with chocolate pudding. He only indulged on his birthday, but since he was leaving the country for a year, I figured he could break his once-a-year rule.
â€œSoâ€¦â€ I pasted the biggest, brightest smile on my face. â€œDonâ€™t kill me, but we need to make a detour to Crumble & Bake.â€
â€œNo. Weâ€™re already late.â€ Alex stopped at a red light. Weâ€™d made it back to civilization, and I spotted the blurred outlines of a Starbucks and a Panera through the rain-splattered glass.
My smile didnâ€™t budge. â€œItâ€™s a small
 detour. Itâ€™ll take fifteen minutes, max. I just need to run in and pick up Joshâ€™s cake. You know, the Death by Chocolate he likes so much? Heâ€™ll be in Central America for a year, they donâ€™t have C&B down there, and he leaves in two days soâ€”â€
â€œStop.â€ Alexâ€™s fingers curled around the steering wheel, and my crazy, hormonal mind latched onto how beautiful they were. That might sound crazy because who has beautiful fingers?
 But he did. Physically, everything
 about him was beautiful. The jade-green eyes that glared out from beneath dark brows like chips hewn from a glacier; the sharp jawline and elegant, sculpted cheekbones; the lean frame and thick, light brown hair that somehow looked both tousled and perfectly coiffed. He resembled a statue in an Italian museum come to life.
The insane urge to ruffle his hair like I would a kidâ€™s gripped me, just so heâ€™d stop looking so perfectâ€”which was quite irritating to the rest of us mere mortalsâ€”but I didnâ€™t have a death wish, so I kept my hands planted in my lap.
â€œIf I take you to Crumble & Bake, will you stop talking?â€
No doubt he regretted picking me up.
My smile grew. â€œIf you want.â€
His lips thinned. â€œFine.â€

Yes!


Ava Chen: One.


Alex Volkov: Zero.

When we arrived at the bakery, I unbuckled my seatbelt and was halfway out the door when Alex grabbed my arm and pulled me back into my seat. Contrary to what Iâ€™d expected, his touch wasnâ€™t coldâ€”it was scorching, and it burned through my skin and muscles until I felt its warmth in the pit of my stomach.
I swallowed hard. Stupid hormones.
 â€œWhat? Weâ€™re already late, and theyâ€™re closing soon.â€
â€œYou canâ€™t go out like that.â€ The tiniest hint of disapproval etched into the corners of his mouth.
â€œLike what?â€ I asked, confused. I wore jeans and a T-shirt, nothing scandalous.
Alex inclined his head toward my chest. I glanced down and let out a horrified yelp. Because my shirt? White. Wet. Transparent.
 Not even a little transparent, like you could kind of
 see my bra outline if you looked hard enough. This was full-on see-through. Red lace bra, hard nipplesâ€”thanks, air-conditioningâ€”the whole shebang.
I crossed my arms over my chest, my face flaming the same color as my bra. â€œWas it like this the entire time?â€
â€œYes.â€
â€œYou couldâ€™ve told me.â€
â€œI did tell you. Just now.â€
Sometimes, I wanted to strangle him. I really did. And I wasnâ€™t even a violent person. I was the same girl who didnâ€™t eat gingerbread man cookies for years after watching Shrek
 because I felt like I was eating Gingyâ€™s family members or, worse, Gingy himself, but something about Alex provoked my dark side.
I exhaled a sharp breath and dropped my arms by instinct, forgetting about my see-through shirt until Alexâ€™s gaze flicked down to my chest again.
The flaming cheeks returned, but I was sick of sitting here arguing with him. Crumble & Bake closed in ten minutes, and the clock was ticking.
Maybe it was the man, the weather, or the hour and a half Iâ€™d spent stuck under a bus shelter, but my frustration spilled out before I could stop it. â€œInstead of being an asshole and staring at my breasts, can you lend me your jacket? Because I really want to get this cake and send my brother, your best friend, off in style before he leaves the country.â€
My words hung in the air while I clapped a hand over my mouth, horrified. Did I just utter the word â€œbreastsâ€ to Alex Volkov and accuse him of ogling me? And
 call him an asshole?

Dear God, if you smite me with lightning right now, I wonâ€™t be mad. Promise.

Alexâ€™s eyes narrowed a fraction of an inch. It ranked in the top five most emotional responses Iâ€™d pulled out of him in eight years, so that was something.
â€œTrust me, I was not staring at your breasts,â€ he said, his voice frigid enough to transform the lingering drops of moisture on my skin into icicles. â€œYouâ€™re not my type, even if you werenâ€™t Joshâ€™s sister.â€

Ouch.
 I wasnâ€™t interested in Alex either, but no girl enjoys being dismissed so easily by a member of the opposite sex.
â€œWhatever. Thereâ€™s no need to be a jerk about it,â€ I muttered. â€œLook, C&B closes in two minutes. Just let me borrow your jacket, and we can get out of here.â€
Iâ€™d pre-paid online, so all I needed was to grab the cake.
A muscle ticked in his jaw. â€œIâ€™ll get it. Youâ€™re not leaving the car dressed like that, even wearing my jacket.â€
Alex yanked an umbrella out from beneath his seat and exited the car in one fluid motion. He moved like a panther, all coiled grace and laser intensity. If he wanted, he could make a killing as a runway model, though I doubted heâ€™d ever do anything so â€œgauche.â€
He returned less than five minutes later with Crumble & Bakeâ€™s signature pink-and-mint-green cake box tucked beneath one arm. He dumped it in my lap, snapped his umbrella closed, and reversed out of the parking spot without so much as blinking.
â€œDo you ever smile?â€ I asked, peeking inside the box to make sure they hadnâ€™t messed up the order. Nope. One Death by Chocolate, coming right up. â€œIt might help with your condition.â€
â€œWhat condition?â€ Alex sounded bored.
â€œStickuptheassitis.â€ Iâ€™d already called the man an asshole, so what was one more insult?
I mightâ€™ve imagined it, but I thought I saw his mouth twitch before he responded with a bland, â€œNo. The condition is chronic.â€
My hands froze while my jaw unhinged. â€œD-did you make a joke?â€
â€œExplain why you were out there in the first place.â€ Alex evaded my question and changed subjects so quick I had whiplash.

He made a joke.
 I wouldnâ€™t have believed it had I not seen it with my own eyes. â€œI had a photoshoot with clients. Thereâ€™s a nice lake inâ€”â€
â€œSpare me the details. I donâ€™t care.â€
A low growl slipped from my throat. â€œWhy are you
 here? Didnâ€™t figure you for the chauffeur type.â€
â€œI was in the area, and youâ€™re Joshâ€™s little sister. If you died, heâ€™d be a bore to hang out with.â€ Alex pulled up in front of my house. Next door, AKA at Joshâ€™s house, the lights blazed, and I could see people dancing and laughing through the windows.
â€œJosh has the worst taste in friends,â€ I bit out. â€œI donâ€™t know what he sees in you. I hope that stick in your ass punctures a vital organ.â€ Then, because Iâ€™d been raised with manners, I added, â€œThank you for the ride.â€
I huffed out of the car. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and I smelled damp earth and the hydrangeas clustered in a pot by the front door. Iâ€™d shower, change, then catch the last half of Joshâ€™s party. Hopefully, he wouldnâ€™t give me shit for getting stranded or being late because I wasnâ€™t in the mood.
I never stay angry for long, but right then, my blood simmered and I wanted to punch Alex Volkov in the face.
He was so cold and arrogant andâ€¦andâ€¦him.
 It was infuriating.
At least I didnâ€™t have to deal with him often. Josh usually hung out with him in the city, and Alex didnâ€™t visit Thayer even though he was an alumnus.

Thank God.
 If I had to see Alex more than a few times a year, Iâ€™d go crazy.

Alex






â€œWe should take
 this somewhere moreâ€¦private.â€ The blonde trailed her fingers down my arm, her hazel eyes bright with invitation as she swiped her tongue over her bottom lip. â€œOr not. Whatever youâ€™re into.â€
My lips curvedâ€”not enough to classify as a smile, but enough to broadcast my thoughts. You canâ€™t handle what Iâ€™m into.

Despite her short, tight dress and suggestive words, she looked like the type who expected sweet nothings and lovemaking in bed.
I didnâ€™t do sweet nothings or lovemaking.
I fucked a certain way, and only a specific type of woman was into that shit. Not hardcore BDSM, but not soft. No kissing, no face-to-face contact. Women agreed, then tried to change it up halfway through, after which Iâ€™d stop and show them the door. I have no tolerance for people who canâ€™t keep to a simple agreement.
That was why I stuck to a roster of familiar rotating names when I needed a release; both sides knew what to expect.
The blonde was not making it onto that roster.
â€œNot tonight.â€ I swirled the ice in my glass. â€œItâ€™s my friendâ€™s farewell party.â€
She followed my gaze toward Josh, who was basking in female attention of his own. He sprawled on the couch, one of the few remaining pieces of furniture after heâ€™d packed the house up in anticipation of his year abroad, and grinned while three women fawned over him. Heâ€™d always been the charming one. While I put people on edge, he put them at ease, and his approach toward the fairer sex was the opposite of mine. The more, the merrier, according to Josh. Heâ€™d probably fucked half the D.C. metro areaâ€™s female population by now.
â€œHe can join too.â€ The blonde edged closer until her tits grazed my arm. â€œI donâ€™t mind.â€
â€œSame.â€ Her friend, a petite brunette who had been quiet up till now but whoâ€™d eyed me like I was a juicy steak since I walked in the door, piped up. â€œLyss and I do everything
 together.â€
The insinuation couldnâ€™t have been clearer had she tattooed it across her exposed cleavage.
Most guys wouldâ€™ve jumped at the opportunity, but I was already bored with the conversation. Nothing turned me off more than desperation, which reeked stronger than their perfume.
I didnâ€™t bother answering. Instead, I scanned the room for something more interesting to hold my attention. If it were a party for anyone else but Josh, I wouldâ€™ve skipped it. Between my job as COO of The Archer Group and myâ€¦side project, I had enough on my plate without attending pointless social gatherings. But Josh was my best friendâ€”one of the few people whose company I could stand for more than an hour at a timeâ€”and he was leaving Monday for his gap year as a medical volunteer in Central America. So here I was, pretending like I actually wanted to be here.
A silvery laugh pealed through the air, drawing my eyes toward the source.

Ava.
 Of course.
Joshâ€™s little sister was so sweet and sunshiney all the time, I half-expected flowers to sprout on the ground wherever she walked and a coterie of singing woodland animals to trail behind her while she traipsed through meadows or whatever girls like her did.
She stood in the corner with her friends, her face bright with animation as she laughed at something one of them said. I wondered if it was a real laugh or a fake laugh. Most laughsâ€”hell, most peopleâ€”were fake. They woke up every morning and put on a mask according to what they wanted that day and who they wanted the world to see. They smiled at people they hated, laughed at jokes that werenâ€™t funny, and kissed the asses of those they secretly hoped to dethrone.
I wasnâ€™t judging. Like everyone else, I had my masks, and they ran layers deep. But unlike everyone else, I had as much interest in ass-kissing and small talk as I did in injecting bleach into my veins.
Knowing Ava, her laugh was real.
Poor girl. The world would eat her alive once she left the Thayer bubble.

Not my problem.

â€œYo.â€ Josh appeared beside me, his hair tousled and his mouth stretched into a wide grin. His hangers-on were nowhereâ€”wait, nope. There they were, dancing to BeyoncÃ© like they were auditioning for a gig at The Strip Angel while a circle of guys watched them with their tongues lolling out. Men.
 My gender could use a little more standards and a little less thinking with their small head. â€œThanks for showing up, man. Sorry I havenâ€™t said hi till now. Iâ€™ve beenâ€¦busy.â€
â€œI saw.â€ I arched an eyebrow at the lipstick print smeared on the corner of his mouth. â€œYou have a little something on your face.â€
His grin widened. â€œBadge of honor. Speaking of which, Iâ€™m not interrupting, am I?â€
I glanced at the blonde and brunette, whoâ€™d moved on to making out with each other after failing to capture my interest.
â€œNo.â€ I shook my head. â€œA hundred bucks says you wonâ€™t survive the full year in Bumfuck, Nowhere. No women, no parties. Youâ€™ll be back before Halloween.â€
â€œOh, ye of little faith. Thereâ€™ll be women, and the party is wherever I am.â€ Josh swiped an unopened beer from a nearby cooler and cracked it open. â€œI actually wanted to talk to you about that. Me being gone,â€ he clarified.
â€œDonâ€™t tell me youâ€™re getting sentimental on me. If you bought us friendship bracelets, Iâ€™m out.â€
â€œFuck you, dude.â€ He laughed. â€œI wouldnâ€™t buy your ass jewelry if you
 paid me.
 No, this is about Ava.â€
My glass paused an inch from my lips before I brought it home and the sweet burn of whiskey flowed down my throat. I hate beer. It tastes like piss, but since it was the drink du jour at Joshâ€™s parties, I always brought a flask of Macallan whenever I visited.
â€œWhat about her?â€
Josh and his sister were close, even if they bickered so much I wanted to duct tape their mouths sometimes. That was the nature of siblingsâ€”something Iâ€™d never quite gotten to experience.
The whiskey turned sour in my mouth, and I set my glass down with a grimace.
â€œIâ€™m worried about her.â€ Josh rubbed a hand over his jaw, his expression growing serious. â€œI know sheâ€™s a big girl and can take care of herselfâ€”unless sheâ€™s getting stranded in the middle of fucking nowhere; thanks for picking her up, by the wayâ€”but sheâ€™s never been on her own for so long and she can be a little tooâ€¦trusting.â€
I had an inkling of where Josh was going with this, and I didnâ€™t like it. At all. â€œShe wonâ€™t be alone. She has her friends.â€ I inclined my head toward said friends. One of them, a curvy redhead in a gold skirt that made her look like a disco ball, chose that moment to hop onto the table and shake her ass to the rap song blasting through the speakers.
Josh snorted. â€œJules? Sheâ€™s a liability, not help. Stella is as trusting as Ava, and Bridgetâ€¦well, she has security, but sheâ€™s not around as much.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t need to worry. Thayerâ€™s safe, and the crime rate here is close to zero.â€
â€œYeah, but Iâ€™d feel better if I had someone I trusted looking after her, ya know?â€

Fuck.
 The train was heading straight off a cliff, and I couldnâ€™t do anything to stop it.
â€œI wouldnâ€™t askâ€”I know youâ€™ve got a lot of shit going onâ€”but she broke up with her ex a couple of weeks ago, and heâ€™s been harassing her. I always knew he was a little shit, but she wouldnâ€™t listen to me. Anyway, if you could keep an eye on herâ€”just to make sure she doesnâ€™t get killed or kidnapped or anything? Iâ€™d owe you big.â€
â€œYou already owe me for all those times I saved your ass,â€ I said wryly.
â€œYou had fun while doing it. Youâ€™re too uptight sometimes.â€ Josh grinned. â€œSo, is that a yes?â€
I glanced at Ava again. Took her in. She was twenty-two, four years younger than Josh and me, and she managed to appear both younger and older than her years. It was the way she carried herself, like sheâ€™d seen it allâ€”the good, the bad, the downright uglyâ€”and still believed in goodness.
It was as stupid as it was admirable.
She mustâ€™ve felt me staring because she paused her conversation and looked directly at me, her cheeks tinting pink at my unflinching gaze. Sheâ€™d changed out of her jeans and T-shirt into a purple dress that swirled around her knees.

Too bad.
 The dress was nice, but my mind flashed back to our car ride, when her damp shirt had clung to her like a second skin and her nipples had strained against the decadent red lace of her bra. Iâ€™d meant what Iâ€™d said about her not being my type, but Iâ€™d enjoyed the view. I could imagine myself lifting that shirt, tugging her bra aside with my teeth, and closing my mouth around those sweet, hardened peaksâ€”
I yanked myself out of that startling fantasy fast. What the fuck was wrong with me? That was Joshâ€™s sister
 . Innocent, doe-eyed, and so sweet I could throw up. The total opposite of the sophisticated, jaded women I preferred both in and out of bed. I didnâ€™t have to worry about feelings with the latter; they knew better than to develop any around me. Ava was nothing but
 feelings, with a hint of sass.
A ghost of a smile passed over my mouth when I remembered her parting shot earlier. I hope that stick in your ass punctures a vital organ.

Not the worst thing anyoneâ€™s said to me, not by a long shot, but more aggressive than Iâ€™d expected coming from her. Iâ€™d never heard her say a bad word to or about anyone before. I took perverse pleasure in the fact that I could rile her up so much.
â€œAlex,â€ Josh prompted.
â€œI donâ€™t know, man.â€ I dragged my eyes away from Ava and her purple dress. â€œIâ€™m not much of a babysitter.â€
â€œGood thing sheâ€™s not a baby,â€ he quipped. â€œLook, I know this is a big ask, but youâ€™re the only person I trust not to, you knowâ€”â€
â€œFuck her?â€
â€œJesus, dude.â€ Josh looked like heâ€™d swallowed a lemon. â€œDonâ€™t use that word in relation to my sister. Itâ€™s gross. Butâ€¦yeah. I mean, we both know sheâ€™s not your type, and even if she was, youâ€™d never go there.â€
A sliver of guilt flashed through me when I remembered my errant fantasy a few moments ago. It was time for me to call up someone from my roster if I was fantasizing about Ava Chen, of all people.
â€œBut itâ€™s more than that,â€ Josh continued. â€œYouâ€™re the only person I trust, period, outside of my family. And you know how worried I am about Ava, especially considering this whole thing with her ex.â€ His face darkened. â€œI swear, if I ever see that fuckerâ€¦â€
I sighed. â€œIâ€™ll take care of her. Donâ€™t worry.â€
I was going to regret this. I knew it, yet here I was, signing my life away, at least for the next year. I didnâ€™t make a lot of promises, but when I did, I kept them. Committed myself to them. Which meant if I promised Josh Iâ€™d look after Ava, Iâ€™d fucking look after her, and Iâ€™m not talking about a text check-in every two weeks.
She was under my protection now.
A familiar, creeping sense of doom slithered around my neck and squeezed, tighter and tighter, until oxygen ran scarce and tiny lights danced before my eyes.

Blood. Everywhere.


On my hands. On my clothes. Splattered over the cream rug sheâ€™d loved so muchâ€”the one sheâ€™d brought back from Europe on her last trip abroad.


An inane urge to scrub the rug and tear those bloody particles out of the soft wool fibers, one by one, gripped me, but I couldnâ€™t move.


All I could do was stand and stare at the grotesque scene in my living roomâ€”a room which, not half an hour earlier, had burst with warmth and laughter and love. Now it was cold and lifeless, like the three bodies at my feet.

I blinked, and they disappearedâ€”the lights, the memories, the noose around my neck.
But theyâ€™d come back. They always did.
â€œâ€¦Youâ€™re the best,â€ Josh was saying, his grin back now that Iâ€™d agreed to take on a role I had no business taking. I wasnâ€™t a protector; I was a destroyer. I broke hearts, crushed business opponents, and didnâ€™t care about the aftermath. If someone was stupid enough to fall for me or cross meâ€”two things I warned people never, ever to doâ€”they had it coming. â€œIâ€™ll bring you backâ€”fuck, I donâ€™t know. Coffee. Chocolate. Pounds of whatever is good down there. And I owe you a big, fat favor in the future.â€
I forced a smile. Before I could respond, my phone rang, and I held up a finger. â€œBe right back. I have to take this.â€
â€œTake your time, man.â€ Josh was already distracted by the blonde and brunette whoâ€™d been all over me earlier and who found a much more willing audience in my best friend. By the time I stepped into the backyard and answered my call, they had their hands beneath his shirt.
â€œÐ”ÑÐ´ÑŒÐºÐ¾,â€ I said, using the Ukrainian term for uncle.
â€œAlex.â€ My uncleâ€™s voice rasped over the line, scratchy from decades of cigarettes and the wear and tear of life. â€œI hope Iâ€™m not interrupting.â€
â€œNo.â€ I glanced through the sliding glass door at the revelry inside. Josh had lived in the same rambling, two-story house off Thayerâ€™s campus since undergrad. Weâ€™d roomed together until I graduated and moved to D.C. proper to be closer to my officeâ€”and to get away from the hordes of shrieking, drunken college students that paraded through campus and the surrounding neighborhoods every night.
Everyone had turned out for Joshâ€™s farewell party, and by everyone, I mean half the population of Hazelburg, Maryland, where Thayer was located. He was a town favorite, and I imagined people would miss his parties as much as they missed Josh himself.
For someone who always claimed to be drowning in schoolwork, he found a lot of time for drinking and sex. Not that it hurt his academic performance. The bastard had a 4.0 GPA.
â€œDid you take care of the problem?â€ my uncle asked.
I heard a drawer open and close, followed by the faint click of a lighter. Iâ€™d urged him to quit smoking countless times, but he always brushed me off. Old habits die hard; old, bad
 habits even more so, and Ivan Volkov had reached the age where he couldnâ€™t be bothered.
â€œNot yet.â€ The moon hung low in the sky, casting ribbons of light that snaked through the otherwise-inky darkness of the backyard. Light and shadow. Two halves of the same coin. â€œI will. Weâ€™re close.â€
To justice. Vengeance. Salvation.
For sixteen years, the pursuit of those three things had consumed me. They were my every waking thought, my every dream and nightmare. My reason for living. Even in situations when Iâ€™d been distracted by something elseâ€”the chess-play of corporate politics, the fleeting pleasure of burying myself into the tight, warm heat of a willing bodyâ€”theyâ€™d lurked in my consciousness, driving me to greater heights of ambition and ruthlessness.
Sixteen years might seem like a long time, but I specialize in the long game. It doesnâ€™t matter how many years I have to wait as long as the end is worth it.
And the end of the man who had destroyed my family? It would be glorious.
â€œGood.â€ My uncle coughed, and my lips pinched.
One of these days, Iâ€™d convince him to quit smoking. Life had driven any sentimentality out of me years ago, but Ivan was my only living relative. He took me in, raised me as his own, and stuck by me through every thorny twist of my path toward revenge, so I owed him that much, at least.
â€œYour family will be at peace soon,â€ he said.
Perhaps. Whether the same could be said of meâ€¦well, that was a question for another day.
â€œThereâ€™s a board meeting next week,â€ I said, switching topics. â€œIâ€™ll be in town for the day.â€ My uncle was the official CEO of Archer Group, the real estate development company heâ€™d founded a decade ago with my guidance. Iâ€™d had a knack for business even as a teenager.
Archer Group headquarters called Philadelphia home, but it had offices across the country. Since I was based in D.C., that was the companyâ€™s real power center, though board meetings still took place at HQ.
I couldâ€™ve taken over as CEO years ago, per my uncleâ€™s and my agreement when we started the company, but the COO position offered me more flexibility until I finished what I had to do. Besides, everyone knew I was the power behind the throne, anyway. Ivan was a decent CEO, but it was my strategies that had catapulted it into the Fortune 500 after a mere decade.
My uncle and I talked business for a while longer before I hung up and rejoined the party. The gears in my head cranked into motion as I took stock of the eveningâ€™s developmentsâ€”my promise to Josh, my uncleâ€™s nudge about the minor hiccup in my revenge plan. Somehow, I had to reconcile the two over the next year.
I mentally rearranged the pieces of my life into different patterns, playing each scenario out to the end, weighing the pros and cons, and examining them for potential cracks until I reached a decision.
â€œEverything good?â€ Josh called out from the couch, where the blonde kissed his neck while the brunetteâ€™s hands became intimately acquainted with the region below his belt.
â€œYes.â€ To my irritation, my gaze strayed toward Ava again. She was in the kitchen, fussing over the half-eaten cake from Crumble & Bake. Her tanned skin glowed with a faint sheen of sweat from dancing, and her raven hair billowed around her face in a soft cloud. â€œAbout your earlier requestâ€¦I have an idea.â€

Ava






â€œI hope
 you appreciate what a good friend I am.â€ Jules yawned as we tromped across our front yard toward Joshâ€™s house. â€œFor waking up at the butt crack of dawn to help your brother clean and pack when I donâ€™t even like the dude.â€
I laughed and looped my arm through hers. â€œIâ€™ll buy you a caramel mocha from The Morning Roast after. Promise.â€
â€œYeah, yeah.â€ She paused. â€œLarge, with extra crunch toppings?â€
â€œYou know it.â€
â€œFine.â€ Jules yawned again. â€œThat makes it somewhat worth it.â€
Jules and Josh were not fans of each other. Iâ€™d always found that strange, considering they were so similar. They were both outgoing, charming, smart as hell, and total heartbreakers.
Jules was a human version of Jessica Rabbit, all shiny red hair, creamy skin, and curves that made me look at my body with a sigh. Overall, I was happy with how I looked, but as a member of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee, I did wish for an extra cup size or two without having to resort to plastic surgery. Ironically, Jules sometimes complained about her double-Ds, saying they were hard on her back. There should be a Venmo for breasts that allows women to send and receive cup sizes with the press of a button.
Like I said, I was happy with how I looked most of the time, but no oneâ€”not even supermodels or movie starsâ€”was immune from insecurities.
Besides her grievances with her breasts, Jules was the most confident person Iâ€™d ever metâ€”aside from my brother, whose ego was so large it could house the entire East Coast of the United States with room left over for Texas. I suppose he had reason to be, considering heâ€™d always been the golden boy, and though it pained me to admit it because he was my brother, he wasnâ€™t bad-looking either. Six-foot-two with thick black hair and razor-sharp bone structure, which he never
 let anyone forget. I was convinced Josh would commission a sculpture of himself and display it on his front lawn if he could.
Jules and Josh never divulged why they disliked each other so much, but I suspected it might be because they saw too much of themselves in each other.
The front door was already open, so we didnâ€™t bother knocking.
To my surprise, the house was pretty clean. Josh had put most of his furniture into storage last week, and the only things left to pack were the couch (which someone would pick up later), a few stray kitchen items, and the weird abstract painting in the living room.
â€œJosh?â€ My voice echoed in the large, empty space while Jules sat on the ground and pulled her knees to her chest with a grumpy expression. If you couldnâ€™t tell, she wasnâ€™t a morning person. â€œWhere are you?â€
â€œBedroom!â€ I heard a loud thump upstairs, followed by a muffled curse. A minute later, Josh came down holding a large cardboard box. â€œShit Iâ€™m donating,â€ he explained, setting it on the kitchen counter.
I wrinkled my nose. â€œPut a shirt on. Please.â€
â€œAnd deprive JR of her morning eye candy?â€ Josh smirked. â€œIâ€™m not that cruel.â€
I wasnâ€™t the only one who thought Jules looked like Jessica Rabbit; Josh always called her by the cartoon characterâ€™s initials, which pissed her off to no end. Then again, everything Josh did pissed her off.
Jules lifted her head and scowled. â€œPlease. Iâ€™ve seen better abs at the campus gym. Listen to Ava and put a shirt on before I lose last nightâ€™s dinner.â€
â€œMethinks the lady doth protest too much,â€ Josh drawled, slapping a hand against his six-pack. â€œThe only thing youâ€™ll be losing isâ€”â€
â€œOkay.â€ I slashed my arms through the air, cutting off the conversation before it went down a path thatâ€™d scar me for life. â€œEnough chitchat. Letâ€™s get you packed up before you miss your flight.â€
Fortunately, Josh and Jules behaved for the next hour and a half while we packed up the remaining items and loaded them into the SUV heâ€™d rented for the move.
Soon, the only thing left to pack was the painting.
â€œTell me youâ€™re donating this too.â€ I eyed the massive canvas. â€œI donâ€™t even know how itâ€™ll fit in the car.â€
â€œNah, leave it there. He likes it.â€
â€œWho?â€ As far as I knew, no one had taken over Joshâ€™s lease yet. But it was still July, and I expected the place to go fast closer to the start of the semester.
â€œYouâ€™ll see.â€
I didnâ€™t like the smile on his face. At all.
The low purr of a powerful engine filled the air.
Joshâ€™s smile broadened. â€œAs a matter of fact, youâ€™ll see right now.â€
Jules and I exchanged glances before we ran to the front door and pushed it open.
A familiar Aston Martin idled in the driveway. The door opened, and Alex stepped out, looking more gorgeous than any human had the right to look in jeans, aviators, and a black button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up.
He took off his sunglasses and assessed us with cool eyes, unfazed by the mini welcoming party on the front steps.
Only I didnâ€™t feel particularly welcoming.
â€œButâ€¦but thatâ€™s Alex,â€ I stammered.
â€œLooking miiiighty fine, might I add.â€ Jules nudged me in the ribs, and I scowled in response. Who cared if he was hot? He was a jerk.
â€œHey, dude.â€ Josh slapped hands with Alex. â€œWhereâ€™s your stuff?â€
â€œMoving companyâ€™s bringing it later.â€ Alex side-eyed Jules, who assessed him the way one would a shiny new toy. Besides Josh, Alex was the only guy whoâ€™d never fallen for her charms, which intrigued her more. She was a sucker for a good challenge, probably because most guys fell at her feet before she even opened her mouth.
â€œWait.â€ I put my hand up, my heart slamming a panicked rhythm against my ribcage. â€œMoving compâ€”youâ€™re not moving here.
 â€
â€œActually, he is.â€ Josh slung an arm over my shoulder, his eyes twinkling with mischief. â€œMeet your new neighbor, little sis.â€
My eyes ping-ponged between him and Alex, who couldnâ€™t look more bored by the conversation.
â€œNo.â€ There was only one reason Alex Volkov would leave his cushy D.C. penthouse and move back to Hazelburg, and Iâ€™d bet my new camera it had nothing to do with nostalgia for his college days. â€œNo, no, no, no, no.â€
â€œYes, yes, yes, yes, yes.â€
I glared at my brother. â€œI donâ€™t
 need a babysitter. Iâ€™m twenty-two years old.â€
â€œWho said anything about babysitting?â€ Josh shrugged. â€œHeâ€™s looking after the house for me. Iâ€™m moving back in when I return next year, so it makes sense.â€
â€œBullshit. You want him to keep an eye on me.â€
â€œThatâ€™s a bonus.â€ Joshâ€™s face softened. â€œIt doesnâ€™t hurt to have someone you can rely on when Iâ€™m not here, especially given this whole thing with Liam.â€
I winced at the mention of my ex. Liam had been blowing up my phone since I caught him cheating on me a month and a half ago. Heâ€™d even shown up at the gallery where I worked a few times, begging for another chance. I wasnâ€™t devastated by our breakup. Weâ€™d dated for a few months, and I hadnâ€™t been in love with him or anything, but the situation had brought all my insecurities to the surface. Josh worried about Liam getting out of hand, but letâ€™s be honest, Liam was a Brooks-Brother-wearing, polo-playing trust fund baby. I doubted heâ€™d do anything that would mess up his perfectly gelled hair.
I was more embarrassed Iâ€™d dated him than concerned about my physical safety.
â€œI can handle myself.â€ I pulled Joshâ€™s arm off my shoulder. â€œCall the moving company and cancel,â€ I told Alex, whoâ€™d been ignoring us and scrolling through his phone this whole time. â€œYou do not
 need to move here. Donâ€™t you haveâ€¦stuff to do in D.C.?â€
â€œD.C. is a twenty-minute drive,â€ he said without looking up.
â€œFor the record, I am totally in favor of you moving in next door,â€ Jules piped up. Traitor.
 â€œDo you mow the lawn shirtless? If not, I highly recommend it.â€
Alex and Josh frowned at the same time.
â€œYou.â€ Josh pointed at her. â€œDo not
 pull any of your shenanigans while Iâ€™m gone.â€
â€œItâ€™s cute how you think you have a say in my life.â€
â€œI donâ€™t give a shit what you do with your life. Itâ€™s when you drag Ava into your harebrained schemes Iâ€™m concerned.â€
â€œNewsflash: you donâ€™t have a say in Avaâ€™s life either. Sheâ€™s her own person.â€
â€œSheâ€™s my sisterâ€”â€
â€œSheâ€™s my best friendâ€”â€
â€œRemember when you almost got her arrestedâ€”â€
â€œYou have
 to let that go. That was three years agoâ€”â€
â€œPeople!â€ I pressed my fingers to my temple. Dealing with Josh and Jules was like dealing with children. â€œStop arguing. Josh, stop trying to control my life. Jules, stop provoking him.â€
Josh crossed his arms over his chest. â€œAs your big brother, itâ€™s my job to protect you and to appoint someone to fill in for me when Iâ€™m not here.â€
I grew up with him; I recognized that look on his face. He wasnâ€™t budging.
â€œI assume Alex is the fill-in?â€ I asked in a resigned tone.
â€œIâ€™m not a â€˜fill-inâ€™ anything,â€ Alex said icily. â€œDonâ€™t do anything stupid, and weâ€™ll be fine.â€
I groaned and covered my face with my hands.
This was going to be a long year.

Ava






Two days later,
 Josh was in Central America and Alex was all moved in. Iâ€™d watched the movers carry a giant flat-screen TV and boxes of varying sizes into the house next door, and Alexâ€™s Aston Martin was now a daily sight.
Since stewing over my situation wouldnâ€™t do me much good, I decided to make lemonade out of my lemons.
The gallery closed on Tuesdays during the summer and I didnâ€™t have any shoots scheduled, so I spent the afternoon baking my signature red velvet cookies.
Iâ€™d just finished packaging them in a cute little basket when I heard the unmistakable roar of Alexâ€™s car pulling in the driveway, followed by a door slam.

Shit.
 Okay, I was ready. I was.
I wiped my sweaty palms against the sides of my thighs. I shouldnâ€™t be nervous about bringing the man cookies, for Peteâ€™s sake. Alex had sat at our Thanksgiving table every year for the past eight years, and for all his money and good looks, he was human. An intimidating one, but a human nonetheless.
Plus, he was supposed to look after me, and he couldnâ€™t do that if he bit my head off, could he?
With that reassurance in mind, I grabbed the basket, my keys, and my phone and made my way to his house. Thank God Jules was at her law internship. If I had to hear her talk about how hot Alex was one more time, Iâ€™d scream.
Part of me thought she did it to annoy me, but another part worried she was actually interested in him. My best friend hooking up with my brotherâ€™s best friend would open up a can of worms I had no interest in dealing with.
I rang the doorbell, trying to still my rampaging heart while I waited for Alex to answer. I wanted to chuck the basket on the front step and run home, but that was the cowardâ€™s way out, and I was no coward. Most of the time, anyway.
A minute passed.
I rang the doorbell again.
Finally, I heard the faint sound of footsteps, which grew louder until the door swung open and I found myself face-to-face with Alex. Heâ€™d taken off his jacket, but otherwise, he still wore his work outfitâ€”white Thomas Pink shirt, Armani pants and shoes, blue Brioni tie.
His eyes roved over my hair (tossed up into a bun), my face (hot as sun-scorched sand for no discernible reason), and my clothes (my favorite tank and shorts set) before settling on the basket. His expression remained unreadable the entire time.
â€œTheyâ€™re for you.â€ I shoved the basket toward him. â€œTheyâ€™re cookies,â€ I added unnecessarily, because duh, he had eyes and could see for himself that they were cookies. â€œItâ€™s a welcome-to-the-neighborhood gift.â€
â€œA welcome-to-the-neighborhood gift,â€ he repeated.
â€œYep. Since youâ€™reâ€¦new. To the neighborhood.â€ I sounded like an idiot. â€œI know you donâ€™t want to be here any more than I want you hereâ€”â€ Crap, that came out wrong.
 â€œBut since we are
 neighbors, we should call a truce.â€
Alex arched an eyebrow. â€œI wasnâ€™t aware a truce was necessary. Weâ€™re not in a war.â€
â€œNo, butâ€”â€ I blew out a frustrated breath. He had
 to make this difficult. â€œIâ€™m trying to be nice, okay? Weâ€™re stuck with each other for the next year, so I want to make our lives easier. Just take the damn cookies. You can eat them, throw them out, feed them to your pet snake Nagini, whatever.â€
His mouth twitched. â€œDid you just compare me to Voldemort?â€
â€œWhat? No!â€ Maybe.
 â€œI used the snake as an example. You donâ€™t seem like the type whoâ€™d have a furry pet.â€
â€œYouâ€™re right on that account. But I donâ€™t have a snake, either.â€ He took the basket off my hands. â€œThank you.â€
I blinked. Blinked again. Did Alex Volkov thank
 me? Iâ€™d expected him to take the cookies and shut the door in my face. Heâ€™d never thanked me for anything in my life.
Except maybe that one time I passed him the mashed potatoes at dinner, but Iâ€™d been drunk, so my recollection was hazy.
I was still frozen in shock when he added, â€œDo you want to come in?â€
This was a dream. It had to be. Because the chances of Alex inviting me inside his house in real life were lower than me solving a quadratic equation in my head.
I pinched myself. Ow.
 Okay, not a dream. Just an incredibly surreal encounter.
I wondered if aliens had abducted the real Alex on his way home and replaced him with a nicer, more civil imposter.
â€œSure,â€ I managed, because hell, I was curious. Iâ€™d never been inside Alexâ€™s home before, and I was curious to see what heâ€™d done with Joshâ€™s place.
Heâ€™d moved in two days ago, so I expected to see stray boxes lying about, but everything was so polished and put together it looked like heâ€™d been living here for years. A sleek gray couch and eighty-inch flat-screen TV dominated the living room, accented with a low, white lacquered coffee table, industrial-chic lamps, and Joshâ€™s abstract painting. I glimpsed an espresso machine in the kitchen and a glass-topped table with white-cushioned chairs in the dining room, but otherwise, there wasnâ€™t much furniture to speak of. It was a drastic difference from Joshâ€™s messy but cozy collection of random books, sports equipment, and items heâ€™d collected from his travels.
â€œYouâ€™re a minimalist, huh?â€ I examined a strange metal sculpture that looked like an exploding brain but probably cost more than my monthly rent.
â€œI donâ€™t see a point in collecting items I donâ€™t use and donâ€™t enjoy.â€ Alex placed the cookies on the coffee table and walked to the bar cart in the corner. â€œDrink?â€
â€œNo, thanks.â€ I sat on the couch, unsure of what to do or say.
He poured himself a glass of whiskey and sat opposite me, but it wasnâ€™t far enough. I caught a whiff of his cologneâ€”something woodsy and expensive-smelling, with a hint of spice. It was so delicious I wanted to bury my face in his neck, but I didnâ€™t think heâ€™d take too kindly to that.
â€œRelax,â€ he said dryly. â€œI donâ€™t bite.â€
â€œIâ€™m relaxed.â€
â€œYour knuckles are white.â€
I glanced down and realized I was clutching the edges of the couch so tightly my knuckles were, indeed, white.
â€œI like what youâ€™ve done with the place.â€ I winced. Talk about a clichÃ© line.
 â€œNo photos though.â€ In fact, I didnâ€™t see any personal effectsâ€”nothing that showed I was in an actual home and not a model showroom.
â€œWhy would I need photos?â€
I couldnâ€™t tell if he was joking or not. Probably not
 . Alex didnâ€™t joke, except for that one blip in his car a few days ago.
â€œFor the memories,â€ I said, like I was explaining a simple concept to a toddler. â€œTo remember people and events?â€
â€œI donâ€™t need photos for that. The memories are here.â€ Alex tapped the side of his forehead.
â€œEveryoneâ€™s memories fade. Photos donâ€™t.â€ At least, not digital ones.
â€œNot mine.â€ He set his empty glass on the coffee table, his eyes dark. â€œI have a superior memory.â€
My snort slipped out before I could stop it. â€œSomeone has a high opinion of himself.â€
That earned me a shadow of a smirk. â€œIâ€™m not bragging. I have hyperthymesia, or HSAM. Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory. Look it up.â€
I paused. That, I hadnâ€™t expected. â€œYou have a photographic memory?â€
â€œNo, theyâ€™re different. People with photographic memory recall details from a scene theyâ€™ve observed for a short time. People with HSAM remember almost everything about their life. Every conversation, every detail, every emotion.â€ Alexâ€™s jade eyes morphed into emeralds, dark and haunted. â€œWhether or not they want to.â€
â€œJosh never mentioned this.â€ Not once, not a hint, and theyâ€™d been friends for close to a decade.
â€œJosh doesnâ€™t tell you everything.â€
Iâ€™d never heard of hyperthymesia. It sounded fantastical, like something out of a science fiction movie, but I heard the truth in Alexâ€™s voice. What would it be like to remember everything?

My heart rate picked up.
It would be wonderful. And terrible. Because while there were memories I wanted to keep close to my heart, as vivid as if they were happening right before my eyes, there were others Iâ€™d rather let fade into oblivion. I couldnâ€™t imagine not having the safety net of knowing horrible events would eventually recede until they were only faint whispers from the past. Then again, my memories were so twisted I remembered nothing before the age of nine, when the most horrible events of my life had occurred.
â€œWhatâ€™s it like?â€ I whispered.
How ironic the two of us were sitting here: me, the girl who remembered almost nothing, and Alex, the man who remembered everything.
Alex leaned toward me, and it was all I could do not to back away. He was too close, too overwhelming, too much
 .
â€œItâ€™s like watching a movie of your life play out before your eyes,â€ he said quietly. â€œSometimes itâ€™s a drama. Sometimes itâ€™s horror.â€
The air pulsed with tension. I was sweating so hard my top stuck to my skin. â€œNo comedy or romance?â€ I tried to joke, but the question came out so breathless it sounded like a come-on.
Alexâ€™s eyes flared. Somewhere in the distance, a car horn honked. A bead of sweat trickled between my breasts, and I saw his gaze dip to it briefly before a humorless smile touched his lips. â€œGo home, Ava. Stay out of trouble.â€
It took me a minute to gather my wits and peel myself off the couch. Once I did, I all but fled, my heart pounding and knees shaking. Every encounter with Alex, no matter how small, left me on edge.
I was nervous, yes, and a bit terrified.
But Iâ€™d also never felt more alive.

Alex






I slammed
 my fist into the mannequinâ€™s face, reveling in the sharp burst of pain that jolted up my arm at the impact. My muscles burned and sweat dripped down my forehead into my eyes, blurring my vision, but I didnâ€™t stop. Iâ€™d done this so many times I didnâ€™t have to see to land my hits.
The smell of sweat and violence stained the air. This was the one place I allowed myself to unleash the anger I kept under careful wraps in all other areas of my life. Iâ€™d started Krav Maga training a decade ago for self-defense, but it had since become my catharsis, my sanctuary.
By the time I finished pummeling the mannequin, my body was a mess of aches and sweat. I toweled the perspiration off my face and took a swig of water. Work had been a bitch, and Iâ€™d needed this release to reset.
â€œHope you worked off your frustration,â€ Ralph, the owner of the training center and my personal instructor since Iâ€™d moved to D.C., said dryly. Short and stocky, he had the powerful build of a fighter and a mean mug, but deep down, he was a teddy bear. Heâ€™d knock my lights out if I ever told him or anyone else that though. â€œYou looked like you had a personal vendetta against Harper.â€
Ralph named all the training dummies after TV characters or real-life people he didnâ€™t like.
â€œShitty week.â€ We were alone in the private training studio, so I spoke more freely than I would have otherwise. Besides Josh, Ralph was the only person I considered a true friend. â€œI could go for the real thing right now.â€
Dummies were good for practice, but Krav Maga was a hand-to-hand combat method for a reason. It was all about the interaction between yourself and your opponent and responding quickly. Couldnâ€™t do that if your opponent was an inanimate object.
â€œYeah, letâ€™s do it. Gotta end right at seven, thoughâ€”no overtime. Thereâ€™s a new class coming in.â€
I raised my eyebrows. â€œClass?â€
The KM Academy catered toward intermediate to advanced practitioners and specialized in one-on-one or small group sessions. It didnâ€™t host large classes the way most other centers did.
Ralph shrugged. â€œYeah. Weâ€™re opening the center up to beginners. Just one class for now, see how it goes. Missy bugged me about it until I agreedâ€”said people would be interested in learning it for self-defense and that we have the best instructors in the city.â€ He barked out a laugh. â€œThirty years of marriage. She knows how to stroke the olâ€™ ego. So here we are.â€
â€œNot to mention, itâ€™s a good business decision.â€ KMA had little competition in the area, and there was likely pent-up demand for lessons, not to mention loads of yuppies who could afford the prices.
Ralphâ€™s eyes twinkled. â€œThat, too.â€
I took another swig of water, my mind spinning. Beginner lessonsâ€¦

Might be a good idea for Ava. For anyone, really, man or woman. Self-defense is a skill you never want to use, but which could mean the difference between life and death when you do
 have to use it. Pepper spray only gets you so far.
I fired off a quick text to her before Ralph and I started our session.
I still wasnâ€™t happy playing babysitter, but Ava and I had settled into a wary â€œtruceâ€â€”her word, not mineâ€”since her olive branch the week before. Plus, when I commit to something, I commit to it one hundred percent. No half-assery or phoning it in.
I promised Josh Iâ€™d look after his sister, and that was what Iâ€™d do. Sign her up for self-defense lessons, upgrade her houseâ€™s shitty alarm systemâ€”sheâ€™d thrown a fit when the security company woke her up at seven in the morning to install the new system, but she got over itâ€”whatever it took. The more she stayed out of trouble, the less I had to worry about her and the more I could focus on my business and plan for revenge.
I wouldnâ€™t mind more of those red velvet cookies though. They were good.
I especially wouldnâ€™t mind if she delivered them wearing the tiny shorts and tank top sheâ€™d worn to my house. An unbidden image of a bead of sweat trailing down her bronzed skin into her cleavage flashed through my mind.
I grunted when Ralph landed a punch in my gut. Fuck.
 That was what I got for allowing my thoughts to stray.
I set my jaw and refocused on the training session, pushing all thoughts of Ava Chen and her cleavage out of my head.
An hour later, my limbs felt like jelly, and I had several blossoming bruises on my body.
I grimaced, stretching out my limbs while the low hum of voices filtered through the closed door to the private studio.
â€œThatâ€™s my cue.â€ Ralph clapped me on the shoulder. â€œGood session. You might even beat me one dayâ€”if youâ€™re lucky.â€
I smirked. â€œFuck you. I can already beat you if I want.â€
Iâ€™d come close to doing it once, but part of me liked the fact I wasnâ€™t the bestâ€”yet. It gave me a goal to strive toward. But I would win. I always did.
Ralphâ€™s laugh rolled through the sweat-dampened space like thunder. â€œKeep telling yourself that, kid. See you Tuesday.â€
After he exited the room, I checked my phone for new messages.
Nothing.
A tiny furrow creased my brow. Iâ€™d texted Ava almost an hour ago, and she was a compulsively fast replier unless she had a photoshoot. She didnâ€™t have one today. I knew because I made her promise to tell me every time she did, along with the location and clientsâ€™ names and contact info. I always ran background checks on the clients beforehand. There were crazy people out there.
I sent a follow-up text. Waited.
Nothing.
I called. No answer.
Either sheâ€™d turned off her phoneâ€”something I told her never to doâ€”or she could be in trouble.

Blood. Everywhere.


On my hands. On my clothes.

My heart rate ticked up. The familiar noose around my neck tightened.
I squeezed my eyes shut, focusing on a different day, a different memoryâ€”that of me attending my first Krav Maga lesson at sixteenâ€”until the red stains of my past retreated.
When I opened them again, anger and worry coalesced into a block in my stomach, and I didnâ€™t bother changing out of my training clothes before I exited the center and took off for Avaâ€™s house.
â€œYou better be there,â€ I muttered. I blocked and flipped off a Mercedes who tried to cut in front of me at Dupont Circle. The driver, an overgroomed lawyer type, glared at me, but I didnâ€™t give a shit.

If you canâ€™t drive, get off the road.

By the time I arrived at Avaâ€™s place, I still hadnâ€™t received a reply, and a muscle pulsed dangerously in my temple.
If she was ignoring me, she was in deep shit.
And if she was hurt, I would bury the person responsible six feet beneath the ground. In pieces.
â€œWhere is she?â€ I dispensed of the usual greetings when Jules swung open the door.
â€œWho?â€ she asked, all doe-eyed innocence. I wasnâ€™t fooled. Jules Ambrose was one of the most dangerous women Iâ€™d ever met, and anyone who thought otherwise because of the way she looked and flirted was an idiot.
â€œAva,â€ I growled. â€œSheâ€™s not answering her phone.â€
â€œMaybe sheâ€™s busy.â€
â€œDonâ€™t fuck with me, Jules. She could be in trouble, and I know your boss. Wouldnâ€™t take much more than a word from me to derail your internship.â€
Iâ€™d done my research on all of Avaâ€™s closest friends. Jules was pre-law, and the internship between a studentâ€™s junior and senior years was critical for admittance into a competitive law school.
All traces of flirty coquettishness melted. Jules narrowed her eyes. â€œDonâ€™t threaten me.â€
â€œDonâ€™t play games.â€
We glared at each other for a minute, precious seconds ticking by before she relented. â€œSheâ€™s not in trouble, okay? Sheâ€™s with a friend. Like I said, sheâ€™s probably busy. Sheâ€™s not glued to her phone.â€
â€œAddress.â€
â€œYouâ€™re hot, but you can be a real overbearing asshole.â€

â€œAddress.â€

Jules huffed out a sigh. â€œIâ€™m only telling you if I can go with you. To make sure you donâ€™t do anything stupid.â€
I was already halfway to my car.
Five minutes later, we were speeding back to D.C. I was going to bill Josh for all my gas expenses when he returned, just out of spite.
â€œWhy are you so concerned? Ava has her own life, and sheâ€™s not a dog. She doesnâ€™t have to jump every time you say fetch.â€ Jules flipped down the visor mirror and retouched her lipstick when we stopped at a red light.
â€œFor someone who claims to be her best friend, youâ€™re not concerned enough
 .â€ Irritation coiled in my stomach. â€œWhen have you known her not to reply within minutes of receiving a text or a call?â€
â€œUh, when sheâ€™s in the bathroom. Class. Work. Sleeping. Showering. A photoâ€”â€
â€œItâ€™s been almost an hour,â€ I snapped.
Jules shrugged. â€œMaybe sheâ€™s having sex.â€
A muscle jumped in my jaw. I wasnâ€™t sure which version of Jules was worseâ€”the one who always tried to convince me to mow the lawn shirtless, or the one who relished baiting me.
Why couldnâ€™t Ava have lived with one of her other friends? Stella seemed more accommodating, and given her background, Bridget wouldnâ€™t ever say the shit Jules said.
But no, I was stuck with the redheaded menace.
No wonder Josh always complained about her.
â€œYou said sheâ€™s with a friend.â€ I pulled onto the street where said friendâ€™s house was located and parked.
â€œA male
 friend.â€ She unbuckled her seatbelt with a beatific smile. â€œThanks for the ride and conversation. It wasâ€¦enlightening.â€
I didnâ€™t bother asking her what she meant. Sheâ€™d just feed me a heap of sugar-laced bullshit.
While Jules took her sweet time, I exited the car and banged an impatient fist against the front door.
It swung open a minute later, revealing a skinny, bespectacled man with confusion stamped on his face when he saw Jules and me standing there. â€œCan I help you?â€
â€œWhereâ€™s Ava?â€
â€œSheâ€™s upstairs, but whoâ€”â€ I shouldered my way past him, which wasnâ€™t hard considering he weighed a hundred sixty, tops.
â€œHey, you canâ€™t go up there!â€ he yelled. â€œTheyâ€™re in the middle of something.â€
Fuck. That. If Ava was
 having sexâ€”a dangerous rhythm pulsed behind my temple at the thoughtâ€”that was all the more reason for an interruption. Horny college guys were some of the most dangerous creatures in existence.
I wondered if sheâ€™d gotten back together with her ex. Josh mentioned the weasel had cheated on her, and she didnâ€™t seem like the type whoâ€™d crawl back to someone after they treated her terribly, but I wouldnâ€™t put anything past Miss Sunshine and Roses. That bleeding heart of hers would land her in a heap of trouble one day.
Once I reached the second floor, I didnâ€™t need to guess what room she was inâ€”I heard sounds bleeding through the half-open door at the end of the hall. Behind me, Jules and Spectacles pounded up the steps, the latter still blabbering about how I couldnâ€™t be up here even though I was already fucking here.
I didnâ€™t know how humans survived this long. Most people were idiots.
I opened the door all the way and froze.
Not sex. Worse.

Ava stood in the middle of the room, clad in a skimpy black lace getup that left little to the imagination. She huddled next to a guy with spiked blond hair holding a camera. They were whispering and laughing while staring at the cameraâ€™s display screen, so engrossed in their little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte they didnâ€™t notice they had company.
My temple pulsed harder.
â€œWhatâ€¦â€ My voice sliced through the air like a whip. â€œIs going on here.â€
It wasnâ€™t a question. I knew what was going on. The setup, the rumpled bed, Avaâ€™s outfitâ€¦they were in the middle of a photoshoot. With Ava as the model. Dressed in something that wouldnâ€™t be out of place in Playboy
 magazine.
The strappy concoction Ava wore barely covered the necessary bits. It looped around her neck, baring her shoulders, and plunged to her navel in the front. The high-cut bottom left her legs and most of her ass bare, and other than the areas covering her breasts and between her legs, the sheer black lace revealed more than it covered.
Iâ€™d never seen her like this. It wasnâ€™t just the outfit; it was everything. The usually straight black hair that fell in luscious waves down her back, the made-up face with the smoky eyes and glossy red lips, the miles of golden skin and curves that etched themselves into my brain forever.
I was caught between disturbing lustâ€”she was my best friendâ€™s sister, for fuckâ€™s sakeâ€”and inexplicable fury that other men were seeing her like this.
Avaâ€™s eyes widened with alarm when she spotted me. â€œAlex? What are you doing here?â€
â€œI tried to stop him,â€ Spectacles panted, out of breath. Living proof that skinniness does not equal fitness.
â€œHeâ€™s here for you, babe.â€ Jules leaned against the doorway, her amber eyes glowing with amusement. â€œYou look super hot, by the way. Canâ€™t wait to see the pics.â€
â€œYou are not seeing the pics
 ,â€ I ground out. â€œNo one
 is seeing the pics
 .â€ I yanked the blanket off the bed and tossed it over Avaâ€™s shoulders, covering her up. â€œWeâ€™re leaving. Right now. And Blondie here is deleting every photo he took of you.â€
Her jaw dropped. â€œNo, Iâ€™m not, and no, heâ€™s not. You canâ€™t tell me what to do.â€ She threw the blanket on the ground and lifted her chin in defiance. â€œYouâ€™re not my father or brother, and even if you were,
 you have no say in what I do in my free time.â€
â€œHeâ€™s taking photos of you half-naked,â€ I snapped. â€œDo you know how destructive those can be if theyâ€™re leaked? If a future employer sees them?â€
â€œI volunteered for this,â€ she snapped back. â€œItâ€™s boudoir photography. Artistic. People do this all the time.
 Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m baring it all for a porn site. How did you even know I was here?â€
â€œOops,â€ Jules said from behind us. She didnâ€™t sound sorry at all.
â€œYou might as well be.â€ The simmering in my blood had reached a full boil. â€œGet. Dressed.â€
â€œNo-oh.â€ Avaâ€™s glare intensified, and she dragged out the word â€œnoâ€ until it had two syllables.
â€œHey, dude, I donâ€™t mean no harm.â€ Blondie let out a nervous chuckle. â€œLike she said, this is art. Iâ€™ll edit it so her face is in shadow and no one can tell itâ€™s her. I just need the photos for my portâ€”what are you doing?â€ He squawked in protest when I snatched the camera out of his hands and started deleting photos but fell silent when I leveled him with a death glare.
â€œStop! Youâ€™re being ridiculous.â€ Ava tried to retrieve the camera, to no avail. â€œDo you know how long those photos took? Stop.
 You areâ€”â€ She yanked on my arm. It didnâ€™t budge. â€œBeingâ€”â€ Another yank, same result. â€œUnreasonable!â€
â€œIâ€™m protecting you, since you clearly canâ€™t do it yourself.â€
My mood darkened further when I saw the pictures of her lying on the bed, staring sultrily at the camera. How long had she and Blondie been doing this, alone? It didnâ€™t take a genius to figure out what had been going through his mind the entire time. It was the same thing that wouldâ€™ve gone through any red-blooded maleâ€™s mind. Sex.
I hoped Blondie enjoyed his working pair of eyes while he still had them.
Ava stepped back for a minute, then lunged for the camera in a poorly concealed attempt to catch me off guard. Iâ€™d expected the move, but I still grunted at the impact as she scrambled over me like a fucking spider monkey. Her breasts grazed my arm, and her hair tickled my skin.
My blood heated at the sensations.
She was so close I could hear her breath coming out in soft pants. I tried not to notice how her chest heaved or how smooth her skin felt pressed against mine. They were dangerous, twisting thoughts that had no place in my mind. Not now, not ever.
â€œGive it back,â€ she ordered.
It was almost cute how she thought she could order me around.
â€œNo.â€
Ava narrowed her eyes. â€œIf you donâ€™t give it back, I swear to God Iâ€™ll walk out into the street wearing this outfit.â€
Another bolt of fury sizzled through me. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t.â€
â€œTry me.â€
Our faces were inches apart, our words so soft no one could hear them except us.
Nevertheless, I lowered my head so I could whisper right in her ear. â€œIf you step a foot outside this room in that outfit, Iâ€™ll not only delete every picture on this camera, but I will destroy your â€˜friendâ€™sâ€™ career until he has to resort to advertising shitty five-dollar-an-hour headshots on Craigslist.â€ A wintry smile touched my lips. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t want that, would you?â€
There are two ways to threaten people: attack them directly, or attack those they care about. I wasnâ€™t above doing either.
Avaâ€™s mouth trembled. She believed me, as she should, because I meant every word. I wasnâ€™t a senator or a lobbyist, but an obscene net worth, thick files of blackmail material, and years of networking had granted me more than my fair share of influence in D.C. â€œYouâ€™re an asshole.â€
â€œYes, I am, and donâ€™t you forget it.â€ I straightened. â€œGet dressed.â€
Ava didnâ€™t argue, but she also refused to look at me as she disappeared into the bathroom across the hall to change.
Blondie and Spectacles gaped at me like the devil himself had poofed into their house. Meanwhile, Jules grinned like she was watching the most entertaining movie of the year.
I finished deleting the photos and shoved the camera back into Blondieâ€™s hands. â€œNever ask Ava to do something like this again.â€ I towered over him, relishing the subtle shake of his shoulders as he tried not to cower. â€œIf you do, Iâ€™ll know. And you wonâ€™t like what happens next.â€
â€œOkay,â€ Blondie squeaked.
The bathroom door opened. Ava brushed past me and said something to Blondie in a low voice. He nodded. She placed a hand on his arm, and my jaw ticked.
â€œLetâ€™s go.â€ The words came out sharper than Iâ€™d intended.
Ava finally looked at me, her eyes flashing. â€œWeâ€™ll go when Iâ€™m ready.â€
I didnâ€™t know how Josh dealt with her all these years. Two weeks in, and I already wanted to strangle her.
She murmured something else to Blondie before she stalked past me without another word. Jules followed, still grinning.
I cast one last glare in Blondieâ€™s direction before I left.
Silence permeated the car as we drove back to Thayer. Jules sat in the backseat, tapping away on her phone, while a stone-faced Ava stared out the window from the passenger seat, her shoulders tight.
I didnâ€™t mind silence. I craved it. There were few things I found more irritating than incessant, pointless conversation. The weather, the latest blockbuster, who broke up with whoâ€¦who the fuck cared?
Still, something compelled me to turn on the radio halfway through the drive, though I left the volume so low I almost couldnâ€™t hear the music.
â€œIt was for your own good,â€ I said over the teeny-tiny beats of the latest rap hit.
Ava turned her body further away and didnâ€™t respond.
Fine. She could be mad all she wanted. The only thing I regretted was not smashing Blondieâ€™s camera altogether.
It wasnâ€™t like I cared about her silent treatment. Not one bit.

Ava






â€œâ€¦Then
 said, never
 ask Ava to do something like this again, or I will murder you and your entire family,â€ Jules finished dramatically before taking a sip of her caramel mocha.
â€œShut up.â€ Stella leaned forward, her eyes wide. â€œHe did not say that.â€
â€œNo, he didnâ€™t.â€ I shot Jules a disapproving look. â€œStop exaggerating.â€
â€œHow would you know? You were in the bathroom,â€ she countered. When my frown deepened, she sighed. â€œFine. He didnâ€™t say those exact
 wordsâ€”at least, not the last partâ€”but the general idea was the same. He did warn Owen away from you though.â€ Jules ripped off a piece of her cranberry scone and popped it in her mouth.
â€œPoor Owen.â€ Guilt niggled at me as I traced absentminded patterns on the table. Jules, Stella, Bridget, and I were at The Morning Roast for our weekly Tuesday coffee catch-up, and Jules had been regaling the other girls with a hyperbolized account of what happened at Owenâ€™s house on Saturday. â€œI wish he hadnâ€™t gotten dragged into this. All those hours of shooting, gone.â€
I worked with Owen at the McCann Gallery, where Iâ€™d served as a gallery assistant for the past year and a half. My father had never said outright he disapproved of me pursuing a photography career, but heâ€™d made it clear that he wouldnâ€™t fund any of my equipment. He paid for my tuition and other school-related expenses, but if I wanted a new lens, camera, or even a tripod? That was all me.
I tried not to let his unspoken disapproval bother me. I was beyond lucky Iâ€™d graduate with no student loan debt, and I wasnâ€™t afraid of hard work. The fact Iâ€™d shelled out my own money for every piece of equipment made me cherish them a little more, and I enjoyed my job at McCann. It was one of the most prestigious photography galleries in the Northeast, and I loved my coworkers, though I wasnâ€™t sure whether Owen would want anything more to do with me after what Alex had done.
Even now, my skin heated with anger at the memory of his overbearing attitude.
I couldnâ€™t believe heâ€™d had the gall to show up and boss me around like that. To threaten my friend. To act like I was aâ€¦a servant or his employee. Even Josh had never gone that far.
I stabbed at my yogurt with my fork, furious.
â€œSounds like I missed an interesting time.â€ Bridget sighed. â€œAll the fun stuff happens while Iâ€™m away.â€
Bridget had been attending an event at Eldorraâ€™s New York consulate, as was required of the Princess of Eldorra.
Thatâ€™s right. She was an honest-to-God, real-life princess, second in line to the throne of a small but wealthy European country. She looked the part, too. With her golden hair, deep blue eyes, and elegant bone structure, she couldâ€™ve passed for a young Grace Kelly.
I hadnâ€™t known who Bridget was when she, Jules, Stella, and I found ourselves assigned to the same suite freshman year. Besides, I wouldâ€™ve expected a freakinâ€™ princess to have a private room.
But that was the great thing about Bridget. Despite her insane upbringing, she was one of the most down-to-earth people Iâ€™d ever met. She never pulled rank, and she insisted on living life as a normal college student whenever she could. In that sense, Thayer was the best fit for her. Thanks to its proximity to D.C. and its world-class international politics program, the campus swarmed with political offspring and international royalty. Just the other day, Iâ€™d overheard the son of the Speaker of the House and the crown prince of a controversial oil kingdom arguing over video games.
You canâ€™t make that stuff up.
â€œTrust me, it was not
 fun,â€ I grumbled. â€œIt was humiliating. And I owe Owen a dinner, at least.â€
My phone flashed with a new text. Liam.
 Again.
I swiped away the notification before any of my friends saw it. I wasnâ€™t in the mood to deal with him or his excuses right now.
â€œAu contraire, I thought it was hilarious.â€ Jules finished the rest of her scone. â€œYou shouldâ€™ve seen Alexâ€™s face. He was pissed.
 â€
â€œHow is that hilarious?â€ Stella snapped a photo of her latte art before joining the conversation.
She was a big fashion and lifestyle blogger with over 400,000 Instagram followers, and we were used to her capturing everything for the â€˜Gram. Ironically, for someone with such a big social presence, she was the shyest in the group, but she said the â€œanonymityâ€ of the Internet made it easier to be herself online.
â€œDid you hear me? He was pissed.
 â€ Jules placed extra emphasis on the last word like it was supposed to mean something.
Bridget, Stella, and I stared at her blankly.
She sighed, obviously exasperated by our lack of comprehension. â€œWhen was the last time any of us saw Alex Volkov pissed? Or happy? Or sad? The man doesnâ€™t show emotion. Itâ€™s like God gave him extra helpings of gorgeousness and zero doses of human feeling.â€
â€œI think heâ€™s a psychopath,â€ Stella said. She blushed. â€œNo normal person is that
 controlled all the time.â€
I was still upset with Alex, but a strange part of me felt compelled to defend him. â€œYouâ€™ve only met him a few times. Heâ€™s not so bad when heâ€™s notâ€¦â€
â€œBeing bad?â€ Bridget finished.
â€œAll Iâ€™m saying is, heâ€™s Joshâ€™s best friend, and I trust my brotherâ€™s judgment.â€
Jules snorted. â€œThis the same brother who wore that hideous rat costume to last yearâ€™s Halloween party?â€
I wrinkled my nose while Bridget and Stella burst into laughter. â€œI said judgment, not taste
 .â€
â€œSorry, I didnâ€™t mean to upset you.â€ Stella tilted her head until her glossy dark curls cascaded over her shoulder. We always joked that she was the United Nations of humans because of her multicultural backgroundâ€”German and Japanese on her motherâ€™s side; Black and Puerto Rican on her fatherâ€™s side. The result was five foot eleven inches of leggy limbs, deep olive skin, and catlike green eyes. Supermodel material, if she had any interest in being a supermodel, which she didnâ€™t. â€œIt was just an observation, but youâ€™re right. I donâ€™t know him well enough to judge. Statement retracted.â€
â€œIâ€™m not upset. Iâ€™mâ€¦â€ I faltered. What the hell was I doing? Alex didnâ€™t need me defending him. It wasnâ€™t like he was here, listening to us. Even if he were, he wouldnâ€™t care.
If there was one person in the world who didnâ€™t give a shit what others thought of him, it was Alex Volkov.
â€œGuys, youâ€™re missing the point.â€ Jules waved a hand in the air. â€œThe point is, Alex did
 show emotion. Over Ava. We could have fun with this.â€

Oh, no.
 Julesâ€™s idea of â€œfunâ€ usually involved a heap of trouble and a potential dose of embarrassment on my part.
â€œWhat kind of fun?â€ Bridget looked intrigued.
â€œBridge!â€ I kicked her under the table. â€œDonâ€™t encourage her.â€
â€œSorry.â€ The blonde made a face. â€œBut all I have going on lately areâ€¦â€ She glanced around to make sure no one was listening. They werenâ€™t, except for her bodyguard Booth, who sat at the table behind us and pretended to read the paper while actually keeping a sharp eye on the surroundings. â€œDiplomatic events and ceremonial duties. Itâ€™s terribly boring. Meanwhile, my grandfatherâ€™s sick, my brotherâ€™s acting weird, and I need something to take my mind off it all.â€
Her grandfather and brother, AKA King Edvard and Crown Prince Nikolai of Eldorra. I had to remind myself they were human beings like everyone else, but even after years of friendship with Bridget, I wasnâ€™t used to her speaking so casually about her family. Like they werenâ€™t literal royalty.
â€œI have a theory.â€ Jules leaned forward, and the rest of us, even me, leaned in, eager to hear what she had to say. Call it morbid curiosity, because I was sure I wouldnâ€™t like what was about to come out of her mouth.
I was right.
â€œAva somehow gets under Alexâ€™s skin,â€ Jules said. â€œWe should see how far it goes. How much
 can she make him feel?â€
I rolled my eyes. â€œAll those long hours you put in at your internship mustâ€™ve scrambled your brain, because youâ€™re not making any sense.â€
She ignored me. â€œI call itâ€¦â€ Dramatic pause. â€œOperation Emotion.â€ She looked up and drew an arc with her hand like the words would magically appear in the air.
â€œCreative,â€ Stella teased.
â€œHear me out. We all think Alex is a robot, right? Well, what if she
 â€¦â€ Jules pointed at me. â€œâ€¦can prove he isnâ€™t? Donâ€™t tell me you guys donâ€™t want to see him act like an actual human being for once.â€
â€œNo.â€ I tossed my empty coffee cup into the nearest trash can and almost beaned a passing student in a Thayer sweatshirt. I winced and mouthed â€œsorryâ€ before returning to the ridiculous proposition at hand. â€œThatâ€™s the dumbest idea Iâ€™ve ever heard.â€
â€œDonâ€™t knock it till youâ€™ve tried it,â€ my so-called best friend sang.
â€œWhat would be the point?â€ I threw my hands in the air. â€œHow would it even work?â€
â€œSimple.â€ Jules pulled a pen and notepad out of her bag and started scribbling. â€œWe come up with a list of emotions, and you try to make him feel each one. Itâ€™ll be a test of sorts. Like giving him an annual physical to make sure heâ€™s functioning properly.â€
â€œSometimes,â€ Bridget said. â€œThe way your mind works scares me.â€
â€œNo,â€ I repeated. â€œNot happening.â€
â€œIt does
 seem kind ofâ€¦mean.â€ Stella tapped her gold-polished nails on the table. â€œWhat emotions did you have in mind?â€
â€œStel!â€
â€œWhat?â€ She cast a guilty look in my direction. â€œIâ€™m curious.â€
â€œOff the top of my head? Weâ€™ve already seen him angry, so happiness, sadness, fear, disgustâ€¦â€ A wicked smile slashed across Julesâ€™s face. â€œJealousy.â€
I snorted. â€œPlease. Heâ€™d never be jealous of me.â€
He was a multimillionaire executive with a genius-level IQ; I was a college student who worked two jobs and ate cereal for dinner.
No contest.
â€œNot jealous of
 you. Jealous over
 you.â€
Bridget perked up. â€œYou think he likes Ava?â€
â€œNo.
 â€ I was tired of saying that word. â€œHeâ€™s my brotherâ€™s best friend, and Iâ€™m not his type. He told me so.â€
â€œPsshh.â€ Jules waved away my protest like she would a mosquito. â€œMen donâ€™t know what
 they want. Besides, donâ€™t you want to get back at him for what he did to Owen?â€
â€œI donâ€™t,â€ I said firmly. â€œAnd Iâ€™m not going along with this crazy idea.â€
Forty-five minutes later, we decided Phase One of Operation Emotion would commence in three days.






* * *


I hated myself for caving.

Somehow, Jules always
 convinced me to do things against my better instincts, like that time we drove four hours to Brooklyn to watch some band perform because she thought the lead singer was hot, and we ended up stranded in the middle of the highway when our rental car broke down. Or that time she convinced me to write a love poem to the cute guy in my English lit class, only for his girlfriendâ€”who I hadnâ€™t known existedâ€”to find it and hunt me down in my dorm.
Jules was the most persuasive person Iâ€™d ever met. A good quality for an aspiring lawyer, but not so much for an innocent friend, i.e. me, who wanted to stay out of trouble.
That night, I climbed into bed and closed my eyes, trying to sort through my racing thoughts. Operation Emotion was supposed to be a fun, lighthearted experiment, but it made me nervous, and not just because it erred on the side of mean-spirited. Everything about Alex made me nervous.
I shuddered, thinking of how heâ€™d retaliate if he found out what we were up to, and thoughts of being flayed alive consumed me until I fell into a light, fitful sleep.

â€œHelp! Mommy, help me!â€


I tried to scream those words, but I couldnâ€™t. I shouldnâ€™t. Because I was underwater, and if I opened my mouth, all the water would rush in, and I would never see Mommy and Daddy and Josh again. That was what they told me.


They also told me not to go near the lake by myself, but I wanted to make pretty ripples in the water. I liked those ripples, liked how throwing one little stone could cause such a big effect.


Only those ripples were suffocating me now. Thousands and thousands of them, dragging me further and further from the light above my head.


Tears trickled from my eyes, but the lake swallowed them and buried my panic until it was just me and my silent pleas.


Iâ€™m never getting out never getting out never getting out.


â€œMommy, help!â€ I couldnâ€™t hold it in any longer. I screamed, screamed as loud as my little lungs allowed. Screamed until my throat was raw and I felt like I would pass out, or maybe that was the water rushing in, filling my chest.


So much water. Everywhere. And no air. Not enough air.


I thrashed my arms and legs in hopes it would help, but it didnâ€™t. It made me sink faster.


I cried harderâ€”not physically, because I couldnâ€™t tell the difference between crying and existing anymoreâ€”but in my heart.


Where was Mommy? She was supposed to be here. Mommies were always supposed to be with their daughters.


And she
 had been there with me on the deck, watching meâ€¦until she hadnâ€™t. Had she returned? What if she was sinking beneath the water too?


The blackness was coming. I saw it, felt it. My brain went fuzzy, and my eyes drooped.


I didnâ€™t have the energy to scream anymore, so I mouthed the words. â€œMommy, pleaseâ€¦â€

I jerked upright, my heart beating a million drums of warning while my faded screams soaked into the walls. My covers twisted around my legs, and I threw them off, my skin crawling at the sensation of being entangledâ€”of being trapped with no way to free myself.
The glowing red letters of my alarm clock told me it was four forty-four a.m.
A pinprick of dread blossomed at the base of my neck and slithered down my spine. In Chinese culture, the number four is considered unlucky because the word for it sounds like the word â€œdeath.â€ SÃ¬,
 four; sÇ
 , death. The only difference between their pronunciation is a tone inflection.
Iâ€™ve never been a superstitious person, but chills swamped me every time I awoke from one of my nightmares during the four a.m. hour, which was almost always. I couldnâ€™t remember the last time Iâ€™d awoken during a different hour. Sometimes I woke up not remembering I had a nightmare, but those blessed occasions were far and few in between.
I heard the soft patter of footsteps in the hall and schooled my features into something other than stark terror before the door opened and Jules slipped inside. She flicked on the lamp, and guilt swirled through me when I saw her rumpled hair and exhausted face. She worked long hours and needed sleep, but she always checked on me even after I insisted she stay in bed.
â€œHow bad was it?â€ she asked softly. My bed sank beneath her weight as she sat next to me and handed me a mug of thyme tea. Sheâ€™d read online that it helped with nightmares and started making it for me a few months ago. It helpedâ€”I hadnâ€™t had a nightmare in over two weeks, which was a record, but I guess my good luck ran out.
â€œNothing out of the ordinary.â€ My hands trembled so much liquid spilled over the side of the mug and dripped onto my favorite Bugs Bunny shirt from high school. â€œGo back to sleep, J. You have a presentation today.â€
â€œFuck that.â€ Jules raked a hand through her tangled red hair. â€œIâ€™m already up. Besides, itâ€™s almost five. I bet there are dozens of overambitious, Lululemon-wearing fitness junkies jogging outside right now.â€
I mustered a weak smile. â€œIâ€™m sorry. I swear, we can soundproof my room.â€ I wasnâ€™t sure how much that would cost, but Iâ€™d deal with it. I didnâ€™t want to keep waking her up.
â€œHow about no? Thatâ€™s totally unnecessary. Youâ€™re my best friend.â€ Jules wrapped me into a tight hug, and I allowed myself to sink into her comforting embrace. Sure, she led me into dubious situations sometimes, but sheâ€™d been my ride or die since freshman year, and I wouldnâ€™t have anyone else by my side. â€œEveryone has nightmares.â€
â€œNot like me.â€
Iâ€™d had these nightmaresâ€”these awful, vivid nightmares that I feared werenâ€™t nightmares at all, but actual memoriesâ€”for as long as I could remember. For me, that was the age of nine. Everything before that was a haze, a canvas peppered with faint shadows of my life before The Blackout, as I called the divide between my forgotten childhood and my later years.
â€œStop. Itâ€™s not your fault, and I donâ€™t mind. Seriously.â€ Jules pulled back and smiled. â€œYou know me. Iâ€™d never say something was okay if I wasnâ€™t actually okay with it.â€
I let out a soft laugh and set the now-empty mug on my nightstand. â€œTrue.â€ I squeezed her hand. â€œIâ€™m fine. Go back to sleep, jog, or make yourself a caramel mocha or something.â€
She scrunched up her nose. â€œMe, jog? I donâ€™t think so. Cardio and I parted ways a long time ago. Plus, you know I canâ€™t work a coffee machine. Thatâ€™s why I blow all my paychecks at The Morning Roast.â€ She examined me, a tiny crease marring her smooth brow. â€œGive me a holler if you need anything, okay? Iâ€™m right down the hall, and I donâ€™t leave for work until seven.â€
â€œâ€˜Kay. Love you.â€
â€œLove you, babe.â€ Jules gave me one last hug before she left and closed the door behind her with a soft click.

I sank back into bed and pulled the covers up to my chin, trying to fall asleep again even though I knew it was a futile exercise. But even though I was tucked beneath my comforter in a well-insulated room in the middle of summer, the chill remainedâ€”a ghostly specter warning me that the past is never past, and the future never unfolds the way we want it to.

Alex






â€œDonâ€™t do this.â€

I poured myself a cup of coffee, leaned against the counter, and took a leisurely sip before responding. â€œIâ€™m not sure why youâ€™re calling me, Andrew. Iâ€™m the COO. You should talk to Ivan.â€
â€œThatâ€™s bullshit,â€ Andrew spat. â€œYou pull the strings behind the scenes, and everyone knows it.â€
â€œThen everyone is wrong, which wouldnâ€™t be the first time.â€ I checked my Patek Philippe watch. Limited edition, hermetically sealed and waterproof, the stainless-steel timepiece had set me back a cool twenty grand. Iâ€™d bought it after I sold my financial modeling software for eight figures, one month after my fourteenth birthday. â€œAh, itâ€™s almost time for my nightly meditation session.â€ I didnâ€™t meditate, and we both knew it. â€œI wish you the best. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll have a flourishing second career as a busker. You took band in high school, didnâ€™t you?â€
â€œAlex, please.â€ Andrewâ€™s voice turned pleading. â€œI have a family. Kids. My oldest daughter is starting college soon. Whatever you have against me, donâ€™t drag them or my employees into it.â€
â€œBut I donâ€™t have anything against you, Andrew,â€ I said conversationally, taking another sip of coffee. Most people didnâ€™t drink espresso this late for fear of not being able to sleep, but I didnâ€™t have that problem. I could never sleep. â€œThis is business. Nothing personal.â€
It baffled me that people still didnâ€™t get it. Personal appeals had no place in the corporate world. It was eat or get eaten, and I for one had no grand aspirations of becoming prey.
Only the strongest survived, and I had every intention of remaining at the top of the food chain.
â€œAlexâ€”â€
I tired of hearing my name. It was always Alex this, Alex that. People begging for time, money, attention or, worst of all, affection. It was a fucking chore. It really was.
â€œGood night.â€ I hung up before he could make another plea for mercy. There was nothing sadder than seeingâ€”or, in this case, hearingâ€”a CEO reduced to a beggar.
The hostile takeover of Gruppmann Enterprises would go ahead as planned. I wouldnâ€™t have cared about the company, except it was a useful pawn in the grand scheme of things.
Archer Group was a real estate development company, but in five, ten, twenty years, itâ€™d be so much more. Telecommunications, e-commerce, finance, energyâ€¦the world was ripe for my taking. Gruppmann was a small fish in the finance industry, but it was a stepping stone toward my bigger ambitions. I wanted to iron out all the kinks before I took on the sharks.
Besides, Andrew was an asshole. I knew for a fact that heâ€™d quietly settled with several of his past secretaries out of court over sexual harassment charges.
I blocked Andrewâ€™s number for good measure and made a mental note to fire my assistant for allowing my personal cell information to slip into the hands of someone outside my tightly controlled contacts list. Sheâ€™d already fucked up several timesâ€”paperwork with errors, appointments scheduled for the wrong times, missed calls from VIPsâ€”and this was the last straw. Iâ€™d only kept her on so long as a favor to her father, a congressman who wanted his daughter to get â€œreal work experience,â€ but her experience was over as of eight a.m. tomorrow morning.
Iâ€™d deal with her father later.
Silence hummed in the air as I placed my coffee cup in the sink and walked toward the living room. I sank onto the couch and closed my eyes, letting my chosen images play through my mind. I didnâ€™t meditate, but this was my own fucked-up form of therapy.

October 29, 2006.


My first birthday as an orphan.


It sounded depressing when I put it like that, but it wasnâ€™t sad. It justâ€¦was.


I didnâ€™t care about birthdays. They were meaningless, dates on a calendar that people celebrated because it made them feel special when, in reality, they werenâ€™t special at all. How could birthdays be special when everyone had one?


I used to think they were special because my parents always made a big deal out of it. One year, they took the entire family and six of my closest friends to Six Flags in New Jersey, where we ate hot dogs and rode roller coasters until we puked. Another year, they bought me the latest PlayStation, and I was the envy of my class. But some things were the same every year. Iâ€™d stay in bed, pretending to be asleep while my parents â€œsnuckâ€ into my bedroom wearing goofy paper cone hats and carrying my favorite breakfastâ€”blueberry pancakes drenched in syrup with hash browns and crispy bacon on the side. My dad would hold my breakfast while my mom tackled me and yelled, â€œHappy birthday!â€ and Iâ€™d laugh and scream while she tickled me fully awake. It was the one day of the year they let me eat breakfast in bed. After my sister was old enough to walk, sheâ€™d join them, climbing over me and messing up my hair while I complained about girl cooties getting all over my room.


Now they were gone. No more family trips, no more blueberry pancakes and bacon. No more birthdays that mattered.


My uncle tried. He bought me a big chocolate cake and brought me to a popular arcade in town.


I sat at a table in the dining area, staring out the window. Thinking. Remembering. Analyzing. I hadnâ€™t touched any of the arcade games.


â€œAlex, go play,â€ my uncle said. â€œItâ€™s your birthday.â€


He sat across from me, a powerfully built man with salt and pepper hair and light brown eyes almost identical to my fatherâ€™s. He wasnâ€™t a handsome man, but he was vain, so his hair was always perfectly coiffed and his clothes perfectly pressed. Today, he wore a sharp blue suit that looked woefully out of place amongst all the sticky children and haggard-faced, T-shirt-clad parents roaming through the arcade.


I hadnâ€™t seen Uncle Ivan often before â€œThat Day.â€ He and my father had a falling out when I was seven, and my father never spoke of him again. Even so, Uncle Ivan had taken me in instead of letting me drift through the foster system, which was nice of him, I guess.


â€œI donâ€™t want to play.â€ I rapped my knuckles against the table.
 Knock. Knock. Knock. One. Two. Three. Three gunshots. Three bodies falling to the floor. I squeezed my eyes shut and used all my strength to shove those images out of my head. Theyâ€™d return, as they had every day since That Day. But I wasnâ€™t dealing with them now, in the middle of a stinky suburban arcade with cheap blue carpet and water ring stains on the table.


I hated my â€œgift.â€ But short of carving out my brain, I couldnâ€™t do anything about it, so I learned to live it with it. And one day, I would weaponize it.


â€œWhat do you want?â€ Uncle Ivan asked.


I shifted my gaze to meet his. He held it for a few seconds before dropping his eyes.


People never used to do that. But ever since my familyâ€™s murder, they acted differently. When I looked at them, they would look awayâ€”not because they pitied me, but because they feared me, some base survival instinct deep inside them screaming at them to run and never look back.


It was silly, adults fearing an elevenâ€”now twelveâ€”year-old-boy. But I didnâ€™t blame them. They had reason to be afraid.


Because one day, I would tear the world apart with my bare hands and force it to pay for what it had taken from me.


â€œWhat I want, Uncle,â€ I said, my voice still registering the clear, high pitch of a boy who had not yet hit puberty. â€œIs revenge.â€

I opened my eyes and exhaled slowly, letting the memory wash over me. That was the moment Iâ€™d found my purpose, and Iâ€™d replayed it every day for fourteen years.
Iâ€™d had to see a therapist for a few years after my familyâ€™s death. More than one, actually, because none made any inroads and my uncle kept replacing them in the hopes one would stick. They never did.
But they all told me the same thingâ€”that my obsessive focus on the past would impede my healing process and that I needed to focus my energy on other, more constructive pursuits. A few suggested art while others suggested sports.
I suggested they shove their suggestions up their ass.
Those therapists didnâ€™t get it. I didnâ€™t want
 to heal. I wanted to burn. I wanted to bleed. I wanted to feel every scorching lick of pain.
And soon, the person responsible for that pain would feel it too. One thousandfold.

Ava






OPERATION EMOTION:
 PHASE SADNESS
I came armed for battle.
I applied makeup, brushed my hair, and wore my favorite white cotton sundress with yellow daisies at the bottom. It was both pretty and comfortable, and it showed off just enough cleavage to intrigue. Liam had loved it. Whenever I wore it, we ended up at his place and my dress ended up on the floor.
Iâ€™d considered throwing the outfit away after we broke up because
 heâ€™d loved it, but I thought better of it. I refused to let him ruin the good things for me, whether it was a dress or mint chocolate ice cream, which he used to buy me whenever I had my period cravings.
I figured looking good couldnâ€™t hurt if I was angling for an unannounced evening moviethon with Alex.
I couldnâ€™t think of any good ideas to make him sad without being a total bitch, so Iâ€™d chosen the neutral option of sad movies. They worked on everyone. Yes, even men.
I saw Josh cry once at the end of Titanic,
 though he claimed it was allergies and threatened to toss my camera from the top of the Washington Monument if I told anyone.
Yeah, right. A decade later, and he still couldnâ€™t shut up about how thereâ€™d been room for Jack on the door. I agreed with him, but that didnâ€™t mean I couldnâ€™t make fun of him.
Since Alex was a teensy
 bit more reserved than Josh, I skipped Titanic
 and brought out the big guns: A Walk to Remember
 (sadder than The Notebook
 ) and Marley and Me.

I knocked on the door to Alexâ€™s house. To my surprise, it opened less than two seconds later.
â€œHey, Iâ€”â€ I stopped. Stared.
Iâ€™d expected to see Alex in a suit from the office or casual loungewear, though nothing he owned was really casual.
 Even his T-shirts cost hundreds of dollars. Instead, he wore a deep gray shirt tucked into dark denim jeans and a tailored black Hugo Boss blazer.
Awfully dressy for a Thursday night.
â€œDid I catch you on your way out?â€ I tried to peer behind him and see if he had company, but Alexâ€™s frame blocked most of the doorway.
â€œShould I move so you have a clearer view of my living room?â€ he asked sardonically.
Heat scorched my cheeks. Busted.
 â€œI donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about. Your living room isnâ€™t that interesting,â€ I fibbed. â€œLack of color. No personal effects.â€ What am I saying? Someone stop me.
 â€œThe paintingâ€™s ugly too.â€ Stop me
 now. â€œ
 Could use a womanâ€™s touch.â€ Fuck. Me. Sideways.

I did not
 just say that.
Alexâ€™s lips pressed together. Had he been anyone else, I couldâ€™ve sworn he was trying not to laugh. â€œI see. The painting technically belongs to Josh, you know.â€
â€œWhich shouldâ€™ve been the first red flag.â€
This time, a tiny smirk did touch Alexâ€™s mouth. â€œTo answer your question, I was
 on the way out. I have a date.â€
I blinked. Alex on a date. Did not compute.

Because of course the guy dated. Look
 at him. But Iâ€™d never heard or seen evidence of activity in his love life, unless you counted the women throwing themselves at him wherever he went, so Iâ€™d assumed he was one of those workaholics who had an exclusive relationship with his job.
I mean, weâ€™d been neighbors for over a month, and I hadnâ€™t seen him bring a single woman homeâ€”though admittedly, I wasnâ€™t watching his house twenty-four-seven like a total creep.
The thought of Alex dating wasâ€¦strange.
That was the only word I could use to describe the niggling feeling in my stomach, the one that made my skin itch and my pulse beat double time.
â€œAh, donâ€™t want to hold you up then.â€ I stepped back and tripped over nothing, because of course I did. He reached out to steady me, and my heart jumped. It wasnâ€™t a big, cheerleading competition worthy jump. It was just a tiny skip, really. But it was enough to fluster me further. â€œIâ€™ll see you later.â€
â€œSince youâ€™re already here, might as well tell me why.â€ Alex was still holding my arm, and the heat from his touch seared me to the bone. â€œI assume this means the cold shoulder treatment is over.â€
Iâ€™d been ignoring him for days since he stormed into Owenâ€™s house like an overbearing, green-eyed tornado. It was the longest Iâ€™d ever held onto my anger. Being upset was exhausting, and I had better things to do with my time, but Iâ€™d wanted to make a point, which was that he couldnâ€™t barge in and try to take over my life without consequences.
â€œFor the most part.â€ I narrowed my eyes. â€œDonâ€™t do that again.â€
â€œDonâ€™t parade in front of other men half-naked, and I wonâ€™t have to.â€
â€œI was not paradingâ€”â€ His words clicked into place. â€œOther
 men?â€
Alex dropped my arm, his eyes growing even more glacial. â€œTell me why youâ€™re here, Ava. Is someone bothering you?â€ His gaze sharpened. â€œLiam?â€
An obvious attempt to change the subject, but my head spun too much for me to call him out on it. â€œNo. It was nothing. Jules is on a date and Iâ€™m bored, so I thought Iâ€™d see if you wanted to hang out.â€
I realized I shouldâ€™ve come up with a less pathetic, more convincing excuse for why Iâ€™d shown up to his house unannounced on a Thursday night, especially since we werenâ€™t friends per se, but it was too late.
See, this was why Iâ€™d never make it as a spy or
 lawyer. Jules would be so disappointed in me.
â€œYouâ€™re a terrible liar.â€ Alex looked unimpressed. â€œTell me the real reason youâ€™re here.â€

Crap.
 I had to come up with another
 excuse? It wasnâ€™t like I could let him know about Operation Emotion.
â€œI figured you could use the company now that Josh isnâ€™t here,â€ I said. â€œI havenâ€™t seen you hang out with anyone else since he left, so I thought you might be lonely?â€ The sentence morphed into a question when I realized how dumb that logic was, because duh, Alexâ€™s life didnâ€™t revolve around his house. He may not throw house parties every week like Josh, but he probably ate out with friends and attended sports games like everyone else. â€œWhich obviously isnâ€™t the case, since youâ€™re going on a date,â€ I added quickly. â€œSo, Iâ€™ll hop on back to my place, and you can forget this ever happened. Enjoy your date!â€
â€œStop.â€
I froze, my heart thundering against my chest as I wondered how this encounter had gone so off the rails. The funny thing was, it wasnâ€™t actually
 off the rails; it just felt like it.
Alex widened the door and stepped aside. â€œCome in.â€

What?
 â€œBut your date.â€
â€œLet me worry about her. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with you, but since you broke your silent treatment to come over and â€˜hang out,â€™ something must be wrong.â€
The seed of guilt blossomed into a full-blown tree, trunk and all, in my stomach. This was supposed to be a harmless experiment. I didnâ€™t want him to cancel his scheduled plans for me.
But as I followed Alex into the living room, the thought that he was no longer going to dinner or whatever heâ€™d had planned with some beautiful, mysterious woman pleased me more than it should have.
I stifled a laugh at Alexâ€™s expression when he caught sight of the movies Iâ€™d brought over.
â€œNot a Mandy Moore fan?â€ I teased, popping the DVD into the player and curling up on the couch while the pre-movie credits played. I still owned DVDs the way I still owned paperback books. There was just something so magical about holding your favorite items rather than seeing them onscreen.
â€œI donâ€™t have anything against Mandy Moore, but Iâ€™m not a fan of maudlin or melodrama.â€ Alex shrugged off his blazer and draped it over the back of the couch. His shirt stretched across his broad shoulders, and the top two buttons were undone, revealing a sliver of his chest and sexy collarbones.
I hadnâ€™t thought collarbones could be sexy, but here we were.
I swallowed hard. â€œIt is not
 maudlin or melodrama. Itâ€™s romantic.â€
â€œDoesnâ€™t she die in the end?â€
â€œWay to spoil it,â€ I grumbled.
He shot me a disbelieving look. â€œYouâ€™ve already watched it.â€
â€œBut have you?â€
â€œI know what happens. People wouldnâ€™t shut up about it when it first came out.â€
â€œShh.â€ I nudged his leg with my foot. â€œMovieâ€™s starting.â€
He sighed.
I loved A Walk to Remember,
 but I snuck peeks at Alex throughout the film, hoping to catch some
 sort of reaction.
None. Nada. Zilch, even during Jamie and Landonâ€™s wedding.
â€œHow are you not crying?â€ I demanded, brushing away my tears with the back of my hand after the end credits rolled. â€œThis movie is so sad.â€

â€œItâ€™s fiction.â€ Alex grimaced. â€œStop crying.â€
â€œI canâ€™t stop when I feel like it. Itâ€™s a biological reaction.â€
â€œBiological reactions can be mastered.â€
I couldnâ€™t resistâ€”I scooted closer to him on the couch and pushed his shoulders forward so I could run my palm down his back.
His muscles bunched beneath my touch. â€œWhat,â€ he said in a tight, controlled voice. â€œAre you doing?â€
â€œIâ€™m searching for your control panel.â€ I patted his back, tryingâ€”and failingâ€”not to notice the sculpted contours of his muscles. Iâ€™d never seen Alex shirtless, but I imagined it was glorious. â€œYou must be a robot.â€
I received a stony glare in response. See? Robot.
â€œDo you have to swap out your batteries, or are you rechargeable?â€ I teased. â€œShould I call you R2-Dâ€”â€
I yelped when he grabbed my arm and spun me around until I straddled one of his legs. My blood roared in my ears as he tightened his grip on my wristâ€”not enough to hurt, but enough to warn me he could easily break me if he wanted.
Our eyes locked, and the roaring intensified. Beneath those jade pools of ice, I glimpsed a spark of something that sent heat curling through my stomach.
â€œIâ€™m not a toy, Ava,â€ Alex said, his voice lethally soft. â€œDonâ€™t play with me unless you want to get hurt.â€
I swallowed my fear. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t hurt me.â€
That mysterious spark crystallized into anger. â€œThis is why Josh was so worried about you. You are trusting to a fault.â€ He leaned forward a fraction of an inch, and it was all I could do not to lean back. Alexâ€™s presence crackled with coiled energy, and I had the unnerving sense that beneath all that ice lay a volcano waiting to eruptâ€”and God help whoever was around when that happened. â€œDonâ€™t try to humanize me. Iâ€™m not a tortured hero from one of your romantic fantasies. You have no idea
 what Iâ€™m capable of, and just because I promised Josh Iâ€™d look after you doesnâ€™t mean I can protect you from yourself and your bleeding heart.â€
Pink blossomed on my face and chest. I was torn between fear and furyâ€”fear of that hard, unyielding look in his eyes; fury over how he spoke to me like I was a naÃ¯ve child who couldnâ€™t tie her shoelaces without hurting herself. â€œThis seems like an overreaction to a simple joke,â€ I said, my jaw tight. â€œIâ€™m sorry I touched you without permission, but you couldâ€™ve told me to stop instead of giving me an entire speech about how you think Iâ€™m a helpless idiot.â€
His nostrils flared. â€œI donâ€™t think youâ€™re a helpless idiot.â€
My anger edged out my fear. â€œYes, you do. You and Josh both. You always say you want to â€˜protectâ€™ me like Iâ€™m not a grown woman whoâ€™s perfectly capable of handling herself. Just because I see the good in people doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m an idiot. I think optimism is a good
 trait, and I feel sorry for people who go through life believing the worst of others.â€
â€œThatâ€™s because theyâ€™ve seen the worst.â€
â€œPeople see what they want to see,â€ I countered. â€œAre there awful people in the world? Yes. Do awful things happen? Yes. But wonderful people exist and wonderful things happen too, and if you focus too much on the negative, you miss all the positive.â€
Utter silence, made all the more awkward by the fact that I was still straddling Alexâ€™s leg.
I was sure he would yell at me, but to my shock, Alexâ€™s face relaxed into a hint of a smile. His fingers grazed the small of my back, and I almost jumped out of my skin.
â€œThose rose-tinted glasses look good on you, Sunshine.â€

Sunshine?
 I was sure he meant that mockingly, but the butterflies in my stomach stirred to life anyway, fanning away my anger. Traitors.

â€œThanks. You can borrow them. You need them more than I do,â€ I said pointedly.
A low chuckle slipped from his throat, and I almost fell to the floor in shock. Tonight was turning out to be a night of firsts.
Alexâ€™s hand trailed up my spine until it rested on the back of my neck, leaving a cascade of tingles in their wake. â€œI feel it dripping all over me.â€

He did notâ€”what?
 An inferno consumed my body.
â€œYouâ€™reâ€”youâ€”no, Iâ€™m not!â€ I sputtered, pushing him away and scrambling off him. My core pulsed. Oh my God, what if I was?
 I couldnâ€™t look, afraid Iâ€™d see a telltale wet spot on his jeans.
Iâ€™d have to move to Antarctica. Build myself an ice cave and learn to speak penguin because I could never show my face in Hazelburg, D.C., or any city where I could run into Alex Volkov again.
His chuckle blossomed into a full-blown laugh. The effect of his real smile was so devastating, even amid my mortification, that all I could do was stare at the way his face lit up and the sparkle that transformed his eyes from beautiful to downright breathtaking.
Holy crap. Perhaps I should be grateful he never smiled, because if that
 was what he looked like while doing itâ€¦womankind didnâ€™t stand a chance.
â€œIâ€™m talking about your bleeding heart,â€ he drawled. â€œWhat did you think I was talking about?â€
â€œIâ€”youâ€”â€ Forget Antarctica. I had to move to Mars.
Alexâ€™s laughter subsided, but the twinkle in his eyes remained. â€œWhatâ€™s the next movie?â€
â€œExcuse me?â€
He angled his chin toward the DVD on the table. â€œYou brought two movies. Whatâ€™s the second one?â€
The sudden subject change gave me whiplash, but I wasnâ€™t complaining. I didnâ€™t want to speak about my dripping anything with Alex. Ever.
My thighs clenched, and I gritted out, â€œMarley & Me.â€

â€œPut it in.â€

Put itâ€”oh, the DVD.

I needed to get my mind out of the gutter.
While the opening credits played, I sat as far away from Alex as possible and â€œcasuallyâ€ placed two throw pillows between us for good measure. He didnâ€™t say anything, but I saw his smirk out of the corner of my eye.
I was so focused on not
 looking at him I barely paid attention to the movie, but an hour later, when my eyes drooped and sleep beckoned, I was still thinking about his smile.

Alex






I silently cursed
 Josh as I carried Ava upstairs. That asshole always put me in situations I didnâ€™t want to be in.
Case in point: sleeping in the same room as his sister.
Iâ€™m sure he would be even less happy about it than I was, but I hadnâ€™t set up the guest roomâ€”I never had guests, not if I could help itâ€”and it was pouring outside, so I couldnâ€™t bring her home without both of us getting drenched. I couldâ€™ve left her on the couch, but she wouldâ€™ve been damn uncomfortable.
I kicked open the door to my room and set her on the bed. She didnâ€™t stir.
My eyes lingered on her form, noticing details I had no business noticing. Her dark hair fanned out beneath her like a blanket of black silk long enough for me to wrap my fist around, and her skirt rode up, baring an inch more thigh than modest. Her skin looked smoother than silk, and I had to clench my hands to refrain from touching her.
My mind flashed back to earlier in the night. Her skin had turned the prettiest shade of red when I made my â€œdrippingâ€ comment, and while Iâ€™d joked about her bleeding heart, a part of meâ€”a very large partâ€”had wanted to bend her over my knee, yank up her skirt, and find out just how wet she was. Because Iâ€™d seen the lust in those big, brown eyesâ€”sheâ€™d been turned on. And if she hadnâ€™t moved away when she didâ€¦
I tore my gaze away, my jaw clenching at the unwelcome thoughts crowding my brain.
I shouldnâ€™t have been thinking about my best friendâ€™s sister this way, but something had shifted. I wasnâ€™t sure when or how, but Iâ€™d started seeing Ava less as Joshâ€™s baby sister and more as a woman. A beautiful, pure-hearted but feisty woman who might be the death of me one of these days.
I never shouldâ€™ve invited her in earlier. I shouldâ€™ve gone on my date with Madeline like Iâ€™d planned, but truth be told, I couldnâ€™t stand Madelineâ€™s company outside the bedroom. She was gorgeous, rich, sophisticated, and understood sheâ€™d get nothing more than a physical relationship out of me, but she insisted on being wined and dined before each of our sex sessions. I only obliged because the woman fucked like a porn star.
A night in with Ava, as bad of an idea as it had turned out to be, had sounded far more appealing than another tiresome meal at a generic fancy restaurant where Madeline preened and pretended we were a couple in front of D.C.â€™s movers and shakers.
She didnâ€™t expect any strings from our arrangement, but she liked status symbols, and Iâ€”as one of the richest, most eligible bachelors in the DMV area, according to Mode de Vie
 â€™s latest Power Issueâ€”was a status symbol.
I didnâ€™t care. I used her; she used me. We got orgasms out of it. It was a mutually beneficial relationship, but my arrangement with Madeline had run its course. Her less-than-pleased reaction when I called to tell her I couldnâ€™t make it tonight had cemented my decision.
Madeline had no claim over me, and if she thought a few dinners and blowjobs would change my mind, she was sorely mistaken.
I lifted Ava so I could tuck her beneath the covers. Iâ€™d expected her to sleep with a dreamy smile like the one she always wore when she was awake. Instead, her brows were drawn, her mouth tight, her breathing shallow.
I almost smoothed a hand over her brow before I caught myself.
Instead, I changed into a pair of black sweats, flicked off the light, and climbed into the other side of bed. A gentleman would sleep on the couch or the floor, but of all the insults people had thrown my way over the years, â€œgentlemanâ€ wasnâ€™t one of them.
I laced my hands behind my head, trying to ignore the soft female presence beside me. Sleep wasnâ€™t forthcoming, per usual, but instead of flipping to a specific day in my mental scrapbook, I let my mind wander as it pleased.

November 27, 2013.


â€œTrust me, dude, my dad will be thrilled he has someone to talk football with.â€ Josh hopped out of the car. â€œMe being an NBA instead of NFL guy is his biggest disappointment.â€


I smirked, following him up the driveway toward his familyâ€™s imposing brick house in the Maryland suburbs. It wasnâ€™t as large as my mansion on the outskirts of Philadelphia where I lived with my uncle, but it mustâ€™ve cost at least a million or two. Thick hedges lined the stone path leading up to the massive mahogany front door, and a fall-themed wreath of flowers accented with a silky bow hung over the brass door knocker.


â€œMy sisterâ€™s doing, most likely,â€ Josh said, noticing my gaze. â€œMy dad hates all that shit, but Ava loves it.â€


I knew little about his sister other than that she was a few years younger than us, and she liked photography. Josh had bought her a secondhand DSLR camera from eBay for Christmas because she kept dropping â€œhintsâ€ about it whenever they spoke on the phone.


I met Joshâ€™s father first. He sat in the living room, watching the Cowboys versus Lions game like Josh had predicted. Michael was shorter than his son, but his chiseled face and sharp eyes made him appear taller than his five-foot-eight inches.


â€œNice to meet you, sir.â€ I held his gaze, unflinching, when I shook his head.


Michael grunted a response.


Josh was a third-generation Chinese-American, which meant his father had been born in the U.S. Michael had been the model son, a straight-A student whoâ€™d attended top-tier schools and founded a successful company despite the fact his own parents never finished high school. Similar to my father, except mine had been born in Ukraine and immigrated to the U.S. in his teens.


My chest tightened. When Josh found out I had no family to celebrate Thanksgiving with other than my uncle, who couldnâ€™t care less about the holiday, heâ€™d invited me to celebrate with the Chens. I was both grateful and somewhat irritated. I hated being the object of anyoneâ€™s pity.


â€œJosh, have youâ€”oh.â€ The female voice behind me halted.


I turned, my cool gaze assessing the petite brunette in front of me. She wasnâ€™t actually that shortâ€”probably five foot five, but compared to my six-three, she was miniature-sized. With her rosebud lips and delicate face, she resembled a doll.


She beamed, and I fought a grimace. It wasnâ€™t normal for smiles to be that bright.


â€œHi! Iâ€™m Ava, Joshâ€™s sister. You must be Alex.â€ She held out her hand.


I stared at it long enough that her smile faded, replaced with an uncomfortable expression, and Josh nudged me in the ribs.


â€œDude,â€ he coughed out the side of his mouth.


I finally shook her hand. It was tiny and delicate, and I couldnâ€™t help thinking how easy it would be to crush it.


This girl and her sunshiney smile wouldnâ€™t last a day in the real world, where monsters lurked around every corner and people hid their dark intentions behind masks. I was sure of it.

A scream yanked me out of my memories and into real life again, where the shadows grew long and the body next to mine writhed with distress.
â€œStop!â€ Stark terror drenched Avaâ€™s voice. â€œNo! Help!
 â€
Five seconds later, Iâ€™d turned on the bedside lamp and was out of bed, gun in hand. I always kept a firearm by my side, and Iâ€™d installed a new, top-of-the-line security system right after I moved in. I didnâ€™t know how an intruder got past all the defenses without triggering an alarm, but they picked the wrong house to break into.
When I looked around though, I didnâ€™t see anyone else in the room.
â€œPlease, stop!â€ Ava twisted on the bed, her face pale. Her eyes were wide open but unseeing. â€œHeâ€”â€ She choked like she couldnâ€™t get enough air in her lungs.

Nightmare.

My shoulders relaxed before tensing again.
She wasnâ€™t having a nightmare; she was having night terrors. Powerful ones, if her reaction was anything to go by.
Ava screamed again, and my heart tripped. I almost wished there were
 an intruder so I had something physical to fight.
I couldnâ€™t wake or restrain her; that was the worst thing you could do when someone had night terrors. All I could do was wait for the episode to pass.
I left the bedside lamp on and kept an eye on her in case she hurt herself with all the thrashing. I hated feeling helpless, but I knew better than anyone that no one can fight our mental battles for us.
Half an hour later, Avaâ€™s screams had quieted, but I continued my vigil. It wasnâ€™t like I could sleep. My insomnia meant I only slept two or three hours a night, though I often crashed for naps in the middle of the day when I could.
I opened my laptop and was reviewing new business documents when my phone pinged.


Josh: Yo, Iâ€™m bored.


Guess I wasnâ€™t the only person who couldnâ€™t sleep tonight.


Me: What do you want me to do about it?




Josh: Entertain me.




Me: Fuck you. Iâ€™m not your circus monkey.




Josh: I woke up my roommate, I snorted so loud. You should def dress up as a circus monkey for Halloween.




Me: Only if you dress up as an ass. Sorry, I mean donkey.




Me: Youâ€™re already an ass.




Josh: What a comedian. Donâ€™t quit your day job.




Josh: P.S. You think I wonâ€™t do it? Iâ€™ll do it just so I can blackmail you with the monkey pics.




Me: You donâ€™t tell someone you want to blackmail them before getting the blackmail material, dumbass.


As Josh and I joked and gave each other shit, I glanced to my side, where Ava slept with her face buried in one of my pillows. A trickle of something that mightâ€™ve been guilt wormed its way into my stomach, which was ridiculous. It wasnâ€™t like weâ€™d messed around.
Besides, sleeping in the same bed as my best friendâ€™s sister wasnâ€™t the worst thing Iâ€™d ever doneâ€¦or would do.
Not by a long shot.

Ava






Something smelled delicious,
 like spice and heat. I wanted to wrap it around me like a blanket.
I snuggled closer to the source, enjoying the strong, solid warmth beneath my cheek. I didnâ€™t want to wake up, but Iâ€™d promised Bridget I would volunteer at a local pet shelter with her this morning, before my afternoon shift at the gallery.
I allowed myself one more minute of cozinessâ€”had my bed always been this big and softâ€”before I opened my eyes and yawned.

Weird.
 My room looked different. No photograph prints papering the walls, no vase of sunflowers by the bed. And did my bed just move by itself?
My eyes latched onto the broad expanse of bare skin beneath me, and my stomach dropped. I looked up, upâ€”straight into a pair of familiar green eyes. Eyes that stared back at me with no hint of the humor from last night.
He flicked his gaze down. I followed itâ€¦and realized, to my abject horror, that I was touching Alex Volkovâ€™s dick. Unintentionally, and he had on sweats, but still.
I. Was. Touching. Alex. Volkovâ€™s. Dick.
And it was hard.
Mortification washed over me in a tidal wave. Move your hand. Move it now!
 My brain screamed, and I wanted to. I really did. But I stayed frozen, paralyzed by shock and humiliation and something else I would rather not name.
A brief image flashed through my mind of what Alex must be packing beneath his pants. I had a feelingâ€”pun intendedâ€”it would rival that of any male porn star.
â€œPlease remove your hand from my cock unless you plan on doing something with it,â€ Alex said coolly.
I finally yanked my hand away and scrambled back, my heart beating a wild rhythm in my chest as I tried to get my bearings.
â€œWhat happened? Why am I here? Did weâ€”did you and Iâ€”â€ I gestured between us, sick with anticipation.
Oh, God, Josh would kill me, and I couldnâ€™t even blame him.
Iâ€™d slept with my brotherâ€™s best friend.

Shit!

â€œRelax.â€ Alex rolled out of bed, lithe and graceful as a panther. Sunlight streamed through the windows and illuminated his sculpted frame, casting his perfectly carved chest and abs in a pale glow. â€œYou fell asleep during that dog movie and it was raining, so I brought you up here. The end.â€
â€œSo we didnâ€™tâ€¦â€
â€œFuck? No.â€
â€œOh, thank God.â€ I pressed a hand to my forehead, relief a cool balm to the heat on my cheeks. â€œThat wouldâ€™ve been awful.â€
â€œIâ€™ll try not to take offense to that,â€ Alex said dryly.
â€œYou know what I mean. Josh wouldâ€™ve murdered us, brought us back to clean up the mess, then murdered us again. Not that I want to sleep with you either way.â€ Liar,
 an annoying voice in my head whispered. I shoved it aside. â€œYouâ€™re not my type.â€
Alexâ€™s eyes narrowed. â€œNo? Then who, pray tell, is
 your type?â€
It was too early for this. â€œUmâ€¦â€ I scrambled to think of a safe answer. â€œIan Somerhalder?â€
He let out a derisive snort. â€œBetter than the sparkly vampire,â€ he muttered. â€œNewsflash, Sunshine, you and Ian arenâ€™t happening.â€
I rolled my eyes and got out of bed, flinching when I saw my reflection in the mirror. Wrinkled dress, tangled hair, pillow creases on my cheek, and was that a line of crusted drool on the side of my lips? Yeah, I wouldnâ€™t win a beauty contest anytime soon.
â€œThanks, Captain Obvious,â€ I said, discreetly wiping the drool from my face while Alex pulled a T-shirt over his head. His bedroom was as sparse as the living room, with nothing except his massive bed, a nightstand with a lamp and alarm clock, and a dresser decorating the space. â€œDonâ€™t get your panties in a twist. Iâ€™m not your type either, remember? Or maybe I amâ€¦â€ I raised my eyebrows at the obvious tent in his pants.
He wanted to be a jerk again? Two could play this game.
â€œDonâ€™t read too much into it. Itâ€™s morning wood. Every guy gets it.â€ Alex ran a hand through his hair, which of course was still perfect after a nightâ€™s sleep. â€œAnd my panties are not
 in a twist.â€
â€œIf you say so,â€ I sang. â€œAlso, stop calling me Sunshine.â€
â€œWhy?â€
â€œBecause itâ€™s not my name.â€
â€œIâ€™m aware. Itâ€™s a nickname.â€
I released an exasperated breath. â€œWe donâ€™t know each other well enough for nicknames.â€
â€œWeâ€™ve known each other for eight years.â€
â€œYes, but we donâ€™t have that type of relationship! Plus, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re mocking me, bleeding heart and all.â€
Alex raised an eyebrow. â€œEnlighten me. What type of relationship do
 we have?â€
We were treading dangerous ground. â€œWeâ€™re neighbors. Friendly acquaintances.â€ I racked my brain for more because those terms didnâ€™t seem right. â€œMovie buddies?â€
He closed the distance between us, and I gulped, holding my ground even though I wanted to run. â€œYou always sleep in the same bed as your acquaintances?â€ he asked softly.
â€œI didnâ€™t ask
 to sleep in the same bed as you.â€ I tried not to stare at the region below his waist, but it was difficult to ignore. My nipples hardened and scraped against my bra, and my skin flushed with arousal.
What the hell was happening? This was Alex,
 for Peteâ€™s sake. The Antichrist. The asshole. The robot.
Except my body mustâ€™ve not gotten the memo, because I was suddenly fantasizing about pushing him on the bed and finishing what my hand had inadvertently started earlier.

No. Get it together. You are not sleeping with Alex Volkov, now or ever.

â€œAnyway, Iâ€”I have to go. Volunteer. Pets,â€ I stammered, barely making sense to myself. â€œThanksforlettingmestayoverseeyoulaterbye
 !â€
I beat a hasty retreat down the stairs and ran home.
I needed a cold shower, ASAP.
PHASE SADNESS STATUS: FAILED

â€œYou touched
 Alexâ€™s dick?â€
 Bridgetâ€™s eyes widened. â€œWhat did it feel like?â€
â€œShhh!
 â€ I glanced around to see if anyone was listening, but everyone was too busy with their duties to pay attention to us. Bridget had volunteered at the shelter long enough the staff didnâ€™t blink an eye at the princess in their midst, and we were always the only volunteers on the days Bridget came in, per the royal familyâ€™s request. â€œItâ€™s unbecoming for a princess to say the word dick.â€
Especially in Bridgetâ€™s posh, lightly accented voice, which sounded like it was made to discuss fancy galas and Harry Winston diamonds, not
 male genitalia.
â€œIâ€™ve said worse things than dick.â€
As someone whoâ€™d been friends with her for almost four years, I could confirm. It still sounded wrong though.
â€œSo?â€ she prompted. â€œWhat did it feel like?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know what you want me to say. It felt like a penis.â€ A big, hardâ€”nope. Not
 going there.
Not now. Not ever.
Bridget and I were cleaning and sanitizing the cages at Wags and Whiskers, a pet rescue shelter located near campus. She was a huge animal person and had been volunteering here since sophomore year. I accompanied her when I had time, as did Stella. Jules was allergic to cats, so she stayed away. But this shelter was Bridgetâ€™s baby. She came twice a week without fail, much to Boothâ€™s consternation.
I stifled a smile at the sight of the burly, redheaded bodyguard eyeing a parrot with suspicion. Despite its name, Wags and Whiskers took in all sorts of animals, not just cats and dogs, and it had a small but robust bird section.
Booth wasnâ€™t scared of birds per se, but he disliked them; he said they reminded him of giant flying rats.
â€œHmm.â€ Bridget seemed disappointed by my uninteresting response. â€œAnd the movies really didnâ€™t make him sad? At all?â€
â€œNope.â€ I rolled up the newspaper from my cage and dumped it in the garbage can. â€œWell, I fell asleep before the end of Marley & Me,
 but I doubt he cried or anything like that. He looked bored the entire time.â€
â€œYet he continued watching both
 movies.â€ Bridget raised a perfect blonde brow. â€œInteresting.â€
â€œHe didnâ€™t have a choice. I was already at his house.â€
â€œPlease. This is Alex Volkov weâ€™re talking about. Heâ€™d throw someone out in a heartbeat if he wanted.â€
True.
I frowned and considered her words. â€œHeâ€™s nicer to me because Iâ€™m Joshâ€™s sister.â€
â€œRight.â€ Bridget let out a soft laugh. â€œWhich phase is up next again?â€
Ugh, the stupid Operation Emotion, or OE as Iâ€™d started calling it. It was the bane of my existence.
â€œDisgust.â€ I had no clue what Iâ€™d do, but that phase seemed easier. I had a feeling lots of things disgusted Alex.
â€œIâ€™d pay good money to see that.â€ Bridget tossed a laughing glance in Boothâ€™s direction. â€œAre you all right, Booth?â€
â€œYes, Your Highness.â€ He grimaced when the parrot squawked, â€œOoh, yes! Spank me, master!â€
â€œI am not your master,â€ he told the bird. â€œGo away.â€
The parrot drew itself up and ruffled its feathers in indignation.
Bridget and I burst into laughter. Apparently, the parrotâ€™s old owner had been quite active sexuallyâ€¦and kinky. Its outburst today was tame compared to its previous tirades.
â€œIâ€™ll miss you.â€ Bridget sighed. â€œI hope my next bodyguard has a sense of humor.â€
I stopped scrubbing the cage. â€œWait, what? Booth, youâ€™re leaving us?â€
Booth scratched the back of his neck, looking sheepish. â€œMy wife is giving birth soon, so Iâ€™ll be on paternity leave.â€
â€œCongrats.â€ I smiled, even though I was pretty sad. He was Bridgetâ€™s employee, but weâ€™d accepted him as an honorary member of our group. Heâ€™d bailed us out of many dodgy situations in the past, and he gave pretty good boy advice, too. â€œWeâ€™ll miss you, but that is so exciting!â€
His face flushed with pleasure. â€œThank you, Miss Ava.â€
He was unfailingly polite and insisted on calling me â€œMissâ€ no matter how many times I told him he could use just my first name.
â€œWeâ€™re throwing you a going away party when the time comes,â€ Bridget said. â€œYou deserve it for putting up with me all these years.â€
Boothâ€™s blush deepened. â€œThatâ€™s not necessary, Your Highness. It wasâ€”isâ€”a pleasure serving at your side.â€
Bridgetâ€™s eyes twinkled. â€œSee, this is why you deserve a going away party. Youâ€™re the best.â€
Before Booth could explode from how red he was turning, I added, â€œWeâ€™ll make it parrot themed.â€
Bridget and I collapsed into laughter again while the bodyguard shook his head with a half-resigned, half-embarrassed smile.
It was almost enough to take my mind off Alex.

OPERATION EMOTION:
 PHASE DISGUST
â€œYou already brought me welcome-to-the-neighborhood cookies.â€ Alex stared at the basket on the dining table.
â€œThese arenâ€™t welcome cookies.â€ I pushed the basket toward him. â€œThese are an experiment. I tried a new recipe and wanted to see what you think.â€
He made an impatient noise. â€œI donâ€™t have time for this. I have a conference call in half an hour.â€
â€œIt wonâ€™t take you half an hour to eat one cookie.â€
Yes, I had finagled an invitation inside Alexâ€™s house again,
 this time for the second phase of OE. Neither Alex nor I mentioned his, er, morning wood situation a few days earlier. I didnâ€™t know about him, but Iâ€™d prefer if we forgot about that morning altogether.
â€œFine.â€ He peered at the confections with suspicion. â€œWhat flavor?â€

Asparagus, raisins, and garlic brittle.
 Iâ€™d picked the most disgusting ingredient mixture I could think of because this was, after all, Phase Disgust. Part of me felt bad because heâ€™d been pretty nice the night we watched those movies and heâ€™d canceled his date for me; the other part was still a little annoyed by how heâ€™d treated Owen, who was afraid to talk to me now because he feared Alex would pop up out of nowhere and kill him.
I cleared my throat. â€œItâ€™s a, um, surprise.â€
I tucked my hands beneath my thighs and jittered my foot as Alex brought a cookie to his mouth. I almost dove for him and knocked it out of his hand, but I was curious how he would react.
Would he spit it out? Gag? Throw the cookie at me and kick me out of the house?
He chewed slowly, his face not betraying any emotion whatsoever.
â€œWell? What do you think?â€ I injected fake pep in my voice. â€œGood?â€
â€œYou baked these.â€ Not a question.
â€œYep.â€
â€œYou baked the red velvet cookies, and you bakedâ€¦these.â€
My bottom lip disappeared behind my teeth. â€œUh-huh.â€ I couldnâ€™t look him in the eye. Not only was I terrible at lying, I was terrible at keeping a straight face.
â€œTheyâ€™re fine.â€
My head snapped up. â€œWhat?â€ The cookies werenâ€™t fine; they were gross.
 Iâ€™d tried one myself and almost threw up. Asparagus and garlic brittle did not
 mix.
Alex finished chewing, swallowed, and dusted the crumbs from his hands. â€œTheyâ€™re fine,â€ he repeated. â€œNow, if youâ€™ll excuse me, I have a call to take.â€
He left me in the dining room, mouth agape.
I picked up a cookie from the basket and nibbled on it, just in caseâ€”

Blech!
 I gagged and ran into the kitchen to spit out the abomination, then rinsed my mouth with water from the sink to erase the lingering aftertaste.
Alex must have messed-up taste buds, because no normal person wouldâ€™ve been able to swallow those cookies without at least grimacing.
I came to the only conclusion that made sense.
â€œHeâ€™s definitely a robot.â€

OPERATION EMOTION:
 PHASE HAPPINESS

What makes men happy?

The question had plagued me in the lead-up to the third phase of OE. Most of the things that would make men happy didnâ€™t apply to Alex or my situation.
Money? He had plenty of it.
Job satisfaction? Nothing I could do about it.
Spending time with friends? Josh was Alexâ€™s only friend that I knew of, and I was pretty sure Alex did not enjoy most peopleâ€™s company.
Sex? Um, I wasnâ€™t having sex with him for an experiment. Or any other reason, even if I was the teeniest
 bit curious about what it would be like.
Love? Lol, okay. Alex Volkov in love. Sure.
Jules suggested a blowjob, which fell under sex and which I vetoed.
It took days of brainstorming, but I came up with something that might
 work. Perhaps it wouldnâ€™t make Alex soul-happy, but itâ€™ll help him relax and laugh a little.
Maybe.
â€œI dislike sitting on the ground.â€ He stared at the grass like it was a mud pit. â€œItâ€™s uncomfortable and unsanitary.â€
â€œItâ€™s not. How is it unsanitary?â€ I laid a blanket out and anchored it with the picnic basket so it wouldnâ€™t blow away. Iâ€™d convinced him to go for a picnic at Meridian Hill Park. When I brought it up, heâ€™d acted like Iâ€™d suddenly sprouted two heads, but heâ€™d agreed.
Now, if only he would stop acting like such a grouch, we could enjoy the last days of summer.
â€œThe grass is probably soaked with dog urine,â€ he said.
I winced at the mental image. â€œThatâ€™s what the blanket is for. Sit.â€

Alex heaved an aggrieved sigh and sat, looking unhappy about it the entire time.
Undeterred, I unpacked the picnic basket, which contained summer pasta (my favorite), lobster rolls (Alexâ€™s favorite, according to Josh), assorted fruit, cheese and crackers, strawberry lemonade, and of course, my red velvet cookies, which Alex seemed to like.
â€œThis is so much better than being cooped up inside.â€ I stretched my arms over my head, luxuriating in the sunshine. â€œFresh air, good food. Donâ€™t you feel happier already?â€
â€œNo. There are children screaming everywhere, and a fly just landed in your salad.â€

Damn flies.
 I quickly shooed it away.
â€œWhy are we here, Ava?â€ Alexâ€™s brow pinched.
â€œIâ€™m trying to help you relax, but youâ€™re making it damn hard.â€ I threw my hands in the air, pretty exasperated myself. â€œYou know that magical thing you did during movie night called a laugh? You did it once, you can do it again. Come on,â€ I encouraged while he stared at me like I was crazy. â€œYou must have some
 warm, fuzzy feelings left inside of you somewhere.â€
And that was the moment a dog from a nearby party wandered over and peed on Alexâ€™s shoes.
PHASE HAPPINESS STATUS: FAILED



* * *


OPERATION EMOTION:
 PHASE FEAR
We were stuck.
Between my friends and I, none of us could think of a single thing that would inspire fear in Alexâ€”at least, none that werenâ€™t illegal or fucked up.
Jules, who was more comfortable with â€œfucked upâ€ than the rest of us, joked about pretending to rob him at knifepointâ€”at least, I hoped she was jokingâ€”until Stella pointed out Alex would likely turn the situation around and kill me
 before he figured out it was a prank.
I agreed.
I was too young to die, so we scrapped any ideas that would involve a physical confrontation.
In the absence of any lightbulb moments, I turned to my last resort, Josh.
We video-chatted every week, catching each other up on our lives, and right now, he was telling me about his new â€œfriend with benefits.â€
Seriously.
Trust Josh to find women even in the middle of a tiny Central American village doing medical volunteer work.
â€œHow is that possible?â€ I demanded. â€œThereâ€™s less than a hundred people in that village!â€ I knew because Iâ€™d Googled it after Josh announced his placement.
â€œWhat can I say? Iâ€™m charmed,â€ he drawled. â€œWherever I go, women follow.â€
â€œI think she was there before you, dickhead, and I hope youâ€™re not neglecting your work to make out with your new â€˜friendâ€™.â€
â€œDa fuck? Tell me youâ€™re kidding.â€
I waved my hand in the air. â€œI am, I am. Donâ€™t get your knickers in a twist.â€
As much of a horndog as my brother was, he took his work seriously. Whereas I had to bust my ass for my Aâ€™s, he was one of those annoying people who didnâ€™t have to study much to excel in school. But he loved medical work and helping people. Even when we were young, he was the one whoâ€™d bandaged me up after I scraped my knee and looked up ways to help me with my nightmares while our father threw himself into work.
It was why I let Josh get away with his overprotectiveness. He could be annoying as hell, but he was still the best brother.
Iâ€™d never tell him that though. If his head inflated any more, heâ€™d have trouble walking.
â€œBy the way.â€ I tried to sound casual as I fiddled with the sleeve of my shirt. â€œHalloween is coming up, and I was thinking of pulling some pranks. Is there anything Alex is scared of? Clowns, spiders, heightsâ€¦â€
Suspicion crawled into Joshâ€™s face. â€œHalloween is more than two months away.â€
â€œYeah, but it sneaks up on you, and I want to prepare.â€
â€œHmm.â€ Josh tapped his fingers on his thigh. â€œHmmâ€¦
 â€
â€œAny time before Iâ€™m eighty would be great.â€
â€œShut up. You know how hard it is to think of something Alex is scared of? Iâ€™ve known him for eight years, and Iâ€™ve never once seen him afraid.â€
My face fell. Well, shit.

â€œYou could try the usual stuff people hate, but I doubt youâ€™d get anywhere.â€ Josh shrugged. â€œOne time we ran into a bear while hiking and the fucker didnâ€™t even blink. Just stood there looking bored and annoyed until the bear wandered off. Jump scares donâ€™t work either. Trust meâ€”Iâ€™ve tried many times to prank him in the past and failed every time.â€
â€œGood to know.â€
Perhaps this phase was a lost cause. If Josh, who knew Alex better than anyone, couldnâ€™t scare him, none of us could.
The suspicion returned to Joshâ€™s eyes. â€œIs this your idea, or a certain redheadâ€™s?â€
â€œUmmmâ€¦mine?â€
â€œBullshit.â€ Josh scowled. â€œDonâ€™t tell me sheâ€™s still infatuated with Alex. Heâ€™s a lost cause when it comes to relationshipsâ€”wonâ€™t ever get into one, and he only fucks certain women.â€
I was dying to ask who these â€œcertain womenâ€ were, but I couldnâ€™t without sounding like I was interested in Alex. Which I wasnâ€™t.
â€œI donâ€™t think Jules was ever infatuated
 with him,â€ I said. â€œShe just thinks heâ€™s hot.â€
â€œWhatever.â€ Josh raked a hand through his hair. â€œHey, I have an early morning tomorrow, so Iâ€™m gonna crash. Let me know if you succeed in pranking him and take a video of it for me. I could use the laugh.â€
â€œSure.â€ Concern replaced my earlier discomfort at hearing about Alexâ€™s â€œcertain women.â€ I could tell Josh was worn out despite his jokes and wiseass comments. There were dark circles beneath his eyes, and lines of tension bracketed his mouth. Heâ€™d begged off early our last few calls, and usually, he could stay up all night talking about the dumbest stuff.
Once, heâ€™d waxed poetic about his new sneakers until three in the morning.
â€œGet some rest. If I have to fly down to Central America to kick your ass, Iâ€™ll be pissed.â€
â€œHa.â€ Josh snorted. â€œYou wish
 you could kick my ass.â€
â€œNight, Joshy.â€
â€œDonâ€™t
 call me that,â€ he grumbled. â€œNight.â€
After I hung up, I took out my notebook and scratched out phase three.
PHASE FEAR STATUS: ON HOLD (INDEFINITELY)

Ava






â€œThe experiment is a failure,
 but at least itâ€™s over.â€ I sucked down the rest of my cranberry vodka. Iâ€™d nursed it for so long all the ice had melted and it tasted like fruity water. â€œThank God.â€
â€œToo bad.â€ Bridget looked disappointed. â€œI was looking forward to seeing Alex lose his cool.â€
â€œHe still can. The experiment isnâ€™t over yet.â€ Jules wagged her finger in the air.
Unease crawled down my neck. â€œYes, it is. We decided on four phases: sadness, disgust, happiness, and fear.â€
â€œThere are five
 phases.â€ Julesâ€™s hazel eyes sparkled with mischief. â€œThe last is jealousy, or did you forget?â€
â€œI never agreed to that!â€
We were at The Crypt, Thayerâ€™s most popular off-campus bar, for one last hurrah before classes started Monday. Students had started trickling back, and the bar was way more packed than earlier this summer.
â€œBut itâ€™s the best one,â€ Jules argued. â€œDonâ€™tâ€”â€
â€œAva.â€
I stiffened at the sound of my name said in that
 voice. The voice that used to whisper to me at night and tell me itâ€”heâ€”loved me. The voice I hadnâ€™t heard in two months, not since he showed up outside the gallery one day in July and demanded I speak with him.
I tilted my head until hazel eyes clashed with my dark brown ones.
Liam towered over me, handsome and preppy as ever in a navy-blue polo and khakis. Heâ€™d cut his hair, the blond strands no longer the mess of soft curls Iâ€™d loved running my fingers through, but shorter, closer-cropped to his skull.
My peripheral vision revealed my friendsâ€™ reactions to his unexpected appearance in one sweep: nervousness on Stellaâ€™s face, trepidation on Bridgetâ€™s, anger on Julesâ€™s.
â€œWhat are you doing here?â€ I told myself I didnâ€™t need to be scared. We were in public, sitting smack dab in the middle of a crowded bar. I was surrounded by my friends and Booth, who eyed Liam like heâ€™d like to dropkick the guy.
I was safe.
Still, my skin tingled with unease. I thought Liam had given up his quest to win me back, but here he was, looking at me like nothing had changed. Like I hadnâ€™t caught him with his pants down and buried inside a strange blonde the night heâ€™d claimed to have a â€œfever.â€ Iâ€™d dropped by his apartment hoping to surprise him with chicken soup and ended up being the one surprised instead.
â€œCan we talk?â€
â€œIâ€™m busy.â€ I could smell the alcohol on his breath, and I wasnâ€™t interested in talking to a sober Liam, much less a drunk one.
â€œAva, please.â€
â€œShe said sheâ€™s busy, asshole,â€ Jules snapped.
Liam glared at her. Theyâ€™d never gotten along. â€œI donâ€™t remember speaking to you,â€ he sneered.
â€œSee if you remember when I stick myâ€”â€
â€œFive minutes.â€ I stood, my shoulders stiff.
â€œWhatâ€”â€
â€œAvaâ€”â€
â€œAre you sureâ€”â€
My friends all spoke at once.
I nodded. â€œYeah. Iâ€™ll be back in five, okay? If Iâ€™m notâ€”â€ I glared at Liam. â€œYou can come looking for me with torches and pitchforks.â€ Heâ€™d hover all night unless I spoke with him, and Iâ€™d rather get it over with.
â€œI have more than torches and pitchforks,â€ Booth growled.
Liam flinched.
I followed him outside the bar and crossed my arms over my chest. â€œMake it quick.â€
â€œI want you to give me another chance.â€
â€œIâ€™ve already told you a thousand timesâ€”no.â€
Frustration bled into his face. â€œBabe, itâ€™s been months.
 What do you want me to do, fall to my knees and beg? Havenâ€™t you punished me enough?â€
â€œItâ€™s not about punishment.â€ For someone whoâ€™d graduated cum laude, Liam couldnâ€™t seem to grasp such a simple concept. â€œItâ€™s about the fact that you cheated on me.
 I donâ€™t care how long itâ€™s been or how sorry you are. Cheating is unacceptable, and we are not getting back together. Ever.â€
The frustration morphed into anger. â€œWhy? You got a new man?â€ he growled. â€œYou have new dick and you donâ€™t need me anymore, is that it? I never knew you were such a slut.â€
â€œFuck you.â€ My heart pumped fast. Liam had never said such nasty things to me. Ever. â€œYour five minutes are up. This conversation is over.â€
I tried to leave, but he grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. It was the first time heâ€™d laid a hand on me out of anger.
My heart was racing triple-speed now, but I forced myself to remain calm. â€œGet your hands off me,â€ I hissed. â€œOr youâ€™ll regret it.â€
â€œWho is he?â€ Liamâ€™s eyes were wild, and I realized with a sinking stomach that he was not only drunk but high. A dangerous combination. â€œTell me!â€
â€œThere is
 no other guy, and even if there were, itâ€™s none of your business!â€ I wished Iâ€™d brought my pepper spray. Since I hadnâ€™t, I settled for the next best thing: kneeing him in the balls. Hard.
Liam released his hold on me and doubled over in pain. â€œYou bitch,â€ he wheezed. â€œYouâ€”â€
I didnâ€™t wait to hear what he said next. I fled back to the safety of the bar, my pulse roaring in my ears.

I canâ€™t believe that happened.
 Liam had never acted so out of control. Heâ€™d been persistent and kind of douchey, but heâ€™d never physically hurt me.
By the time I told my friends what happened and they ran outside to confront Liam over my protests, he was gone, but my queasiness remained.
You think you know someone until something happens that proves you never really knew them at all.

Alex






Thayer Universityâ€™s
 annual alumni charity gala was the event of the season, but while it did raise money for the latest cause du jour, it wasnâ€™t really about charity. It was about ego.
I attended every year.
Not because I wanted to be a philanthropist or reminisce about my college days, but because the gala was a fountain of information. Thayer counted the most powerful people in the world amongst its alumni, and they all congregated in the ballroom of the Z Hotel D.C. every August. It was the perfect opportunity to network and gather intel.
â€œâ€¦pass the bill, but itâ€™ll get killed in Congressâ€¦â€
I pretended to listen while Colton, an old classmate who now worked in government affairs for a major software company, droned on about the latest piece of tech legislation.
He rarely had anything interesting to say, but his father was high up in the FBI, so I kept him in my orbit in case I needed him in the future.
It was always about the long gameâ€”measured not in weeks or months, but in years. Decades.
Even the tiniest of seeds can sprout into the mightiest of oaks.
It was a simple concept most people didnâ€™t understand because they were too busy chasing short-term gratification, and it was the reason most people fail. They spent their lives sitting on their asses and telling themselves â€œsomedayâ€ when preparation shouldâ€™ve started yesterday. By the time â€œsomedayâ€ came, it was too late.
â€œâ€¦this IP issue with Chinaâ€¦â€ Colton stopped abruptly. Thank God.
 If I had to listen to his nasal voice one more second, I wouldâ€™ve walked over to the bar and stabbed myself in the eye with a fork.
â€œWho is that?
 â€ he asked, a hungry look overtaking his face as he stared over my shoulder. â€œSheâ€™s hot.
 â€ His voice was as hungry as his expression. â€œIâ€™ve never seen her before. Have you?â€
I turned out of mild curiosity. It took me a second to latch onto whatever unsuspecting girl had captured his attention. Colton was almost as big a womanizer as Josh.
When I finally located the source of Coltonâ€™s ravenous gaze, my muscles snapped into a rigid line and my fist closed around the stem of my champagne glass, tight enough the delicate glass could shatter at any moment.
She glided into the ballroom, her lithe body poured into a sleek gown that flowed over her curves like liquid, shimmering gold. Sheâ€™d gathered her hair up in a fancy hairdo, exposing her swanlike neck and smooth shoulders. Dark eyes. Bronze skin. Red lips. All smiles and sunshine, unaware sheâ€™d walked into a pit of vipers.
A goddess entering the gates of hell, and she didnâ€™t even know it.
A pulse ticked in my jaw.
What the hell
 was Ava doing here, wearing that dress? She wasnâ€™t an alumna yet. She shouldnâ€™t be here. Not around these people.
I wanted to gouge out the eyes of every man staring at her like they were starved and she was a juicy steak, which was pretty much every man hereâ€”including Colton. If he didnâ€™t put his tongue back in his mouth soon, Iâ€™d cut it out for him.
I left him salivating behind me without a word and stalked toward Ava, my strides eating up the distance between us with angry, purposeful steps. I made it halfway before someone blocked my path.
I recognized her scent before I saw her face, and my muscles tightened further.
â€œAlex,â€ Madeline purred. â€œI havenâ€™t heard from you in a while.â€
Her scarlet gown matched the glossy lipstick coating her pouty lips. Blonde hair spilled over her shoulders in sculpted waves, and I was close enough to see the faint outline of her nipples through the silky material of her dress.
Once upon a time, that mightâ€™ve turned me on. Now, she might as well be wearing a potato sack for all the reaction her outfit and seductive smile elicited.
â€œIâ€™ve been busy.â€ I sidestepped her; she mimicked my action and blocked my path again.
â€œYou never made it up to me for canceling our date.â€ She trailed her fingers over my arm. It was a light, practiced touch, meant to leave the receiver wanting more.
All I wanted was for her to get out of my way.
My eyes strayed toward Ava again, and my already-tense muscles bunched up further at the sight of Colton by her side. How the fuck did he get over there so fast? Iâ€™d played basketball with him once in college; the man was slower than a turtle on morphine.
â€œAnd I never will.â€ I removed Madelineâ€™s hand from my arm. â€œItâ€™s been fun, but itâ€™s time for us to part ways.â€
Shock scattered over her face before coalescing into a mask of stunned anger. â€œYouâ€™re breaking up
 with me?â€
â€œIn order to break up, weâ€™d have to be dating.â€ I nodded at one of the men staring at her ass. â€œThe congressman looks interested. Why donâ€™t you go say hi?â€
Red tinted her creamy skin. â€œIâ€™m not a prostitute,â€ Madeline hissed. â€œYou canâ€™t pimp me out to another man when youâ€™re done with me. And we are not
 done. Not until I say so. Iâ€™m Madeline fucking Hauss.â€
â€œThatâ€™s where youâ€™re wrong. Weâ€™re all prostitutes in our own ways.â€ My smile lacked any semblance of warmth. â€œIâ€™ll give you a pass for your tone tonight, given our history. But donâ€™t contact me again, or youâ€™ll find out the hard way how I earned my reputation for being ruthless. Iâ€™m not above ruining women.â€
This conversation was over.
I left a sputtering Madeline behind me and walked away, irritated by the interruption and furious at the sight of what awaited me in the middle of the dance floor.
Ava and Colton swayed to music from the live band the university had hired for the gala. His hands rested on her hips, and I saw them inching lower with each passing second.
I arrived next to them right as she laughed at something he said. It rang through the air like silver bells, and the tic in my jaw pulsed harder.
He didnâ€™t deserve her laugh.
â€œSomething funny?â€ I asked, masking my ire with an expression of cool indifference.
Surprise and wariness flared in Avaâ€™s eyes at the sight of me.

Good.

She should be wary. She should be fucking home, safe and sound, instead of dancing with a manwhore like Colton and letting him put his hands all over her.
â€œI was just telling her a joke.â€ Colton chuckled but shot me a warning look that said, Why are you cockblocking, man?
 He was lucky if all I did was cockblock. I was tempted to break every bone in his hand for touching her like that. â€œYou mind? Weâ€™re in the middle of a dance.â€
â€œActually, itâ€™s my turn.â€ I maneuvered myself between them and pulled him off her with a little more force than necessary. Colton flinched. â€œYou have to leave the gala early. Business calls.â€
His brow pinched. â€œIâ€¦â€ His eyes roved between me and Ava, whose own eyes did the same between me and Colton. Realization dawned on his face. Guess he wasnâ€™t so slow after all. â€œAh, youâ€™re right. Sorry, man. I forgot.â€
â€œWeâ€™ll get lunch one day,â€ I said. I didnâ€™t burn bridges unless it was a business rival or I had to. Seeds. Oaks.
 â€œAt Valhalla.â€
The Valhalla Club was the most exclusive private club in D.C. It capped its membership at one hundred members, each of whom was allowed to bring one guest for a meal each quarter. Iâ€™d just handed Colton the ticket of a lifetime.
His eyes widened. â€œOh, y-yeah,â€ he stuttered, trying and failing to hide the awe in his voice. â€œIâ€™d like that.â€
â€œGood night.â€ It was a dismissal and a warning rolled into one.
Colton scurried off, and I turned my displeasure on Ava. We were close enough that I could see the way the lights from the chandeliers reflected in her eyes, like tiny star-beams streaking across an endless night. Her lips parted, lush and wet, and an insane desire to find out whether they tasted as sweet as they looked gripped me.
â€œYou ran off my dance partner.â€ Her voice came out breathier than usual, and my cock jerked at the sound.
I gritted my teeth and tightened my hold on her until she gasped. â€œColton is not a dance partner. He is a womanizer and a slimeball, and itâ€™s in your best interest to stay far, far away from him.â€
It would be in her best interest to stay far away from me too, and the irony wasnâ€™t lost on me. If she only knew why Iâ€™m in D.Câ€¦

But fuck it, I was okay with hypocrisy. It didnâ€™t even crack the top ten of my worst traits. â€œYou donâ€™t know whatâ€™s in my best interest.â€ The star-beams morphed into fire, sparking with challenge. â€œYou donâ€™t know me at all.â€
â€œIs that so?â€ I guided her across the floor, my skin prickling from the strange, electric charge in the air. It was a thousand needles piercing my flesh, searching for a weakness. A crack. A doorway, however tiny, through which it could slip and jumpstart my long-dead, long-cold heart.
â€œYes. I donâ€™t know what Josh tells you about meâ€”if he tells you anything at allâ€”but I assure you, you have no idea what I want or whatâ€™s in my best interest.â€
I paused, causing her to stumble into my chest. My thumb and forefinger grasped her chin, forcing her to look up at me. â€œTry me.â€
Ava blinked, her breaths coming out in short, shallow puffs. â€œMy favorite color.â€
â€œYellow.â€
â€œMy favorite ice cream flavor.â€
â€œMint chocolate chip.â€
Her chest rose and fell harder. â€œMy favorite season.â€
â€œSummer, because of the warmth and sunshine and greenery. But secretly, winter fascinates you.â€ I lowered my head until my own breath skated over her skin and her scent crawled into my nostrils, drugging me. Turning my voice into a hoarse, sinful version of itself. â€œIt speaks to the darkest parts of your soul. The manifestations of your nightmares. Itâ€™s everything you fear, and for that, you love it. Because the fear makes you feel alive.â€
The band played, and the people around us whirled and danced, but in this world weâ€™d carved for ourselves, it was silent save for our ragged intakes of breath.
Ava shivered beneath my touch. â€œHow do you know all that?â€
â€œItâ€™s my job to know things. I observe. I watch. I remember.â€ I gave into my desireâ€”a tiny oneâ€”and traced her lips with my thumb. A shudder rolled through us, our bodies so in sync we reacted the exact fucking way at the exact fucking time. I brought my thumb down and tightened my grip on her chin. â€œBut those are shallow questions, Sunshine. Ask me something real.â€
She stared up at me, those eyes liquid chocolate beneath the lights. â€œWhat do I want?â€
A dangerous, loaded question.
Humans want a lot of things, but in every heart, there beats one true desire. One thing that shapes our every thought and action.
Mine was vengeance. Sharp, cruel, bloodthirsty. It had bloomed from the bloody corpses of my familyâ€™s bodies, inking itself into my skin and soul until my sins were no longer mine but ours. Mine and vengeanceâ€™s, two shadows walking the same twisted path.
Ava was different. And Iâ€™d known what her true desire was the moment I set eyes on her for the first time eight years ago, her face shining and her mouth stretched into a warm, welcome smile.
â€œLove.â€ The word floated between us on a soft gust of air. â€œDeep, abiding, unconditional love. You want it so much youâ€™re willing to live for it.â€ Most people thought the biggest sacrifice they could make was to die for something. They were wrong. The biggest sacrifice someone could make was to live
 for somethingâ€”to allow it to consume you and turn you into a version of yourself you didnâ€™t recognize. Death was oblivion; life was reality, the harshest truth that had ever existed. â€œYou want it so much youâ€™d say yes to anything. Believe in anyone. One more favor, one more kind gestureâ€¦and maybe, just maybe, theyâ€™ll give you the love you want so desperately youâ€™d whore yourself out for it.â€
My tone turned biting; the conversation made a U-turn and headed straight for harsh and brutal.
Because what I admired most about Ava was also what I hated about her. Darkness craves light as much as it wants to destroy it, and here, in this ballroom, with her in my arms and my cock straining against my zipper, that had never been more clear.
I hated how much I wanted her, and I hated that she wasnâ€™t smart enough to run away from me while she still had a chance.
Though letâ€™s be honest, it was already too late.
She was mine. She just didnâ€™t know it yet.
I hadnâ€™t known it myself until I saw her in Coltonâ€™s arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.
Iâ€™d expected her to grow angry at my words, to cry or run away. Instead, she stared at me, unflinching, and said the most unbelievable thing Iâ€™d heard in a long, long time.
â€œAre you talking about me, or are you talking about yourself?â€
I almost laughed at the sheer ludicrousness of the statement. â€œYou must have me confused with someone else, Sunshine.â€
â€œI donâ€™t think I do.â€ Ava stood on tiptoes so she could whisper in my ear. â€œYou donâ€™t fool me anymore, Alex Volkov. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it, the way you noticed all those things about me. How you agreed to look after me, even though you couldâ€™ve said no. How you stayed in to watch those movies with me when you thought I was upset and let me stay the night in your bed after I fell asleep. And Iâ€™ve come to a conclusion. You want the world to think you have no heart when in reality, you have a multilayered one: a heart of gold encased in a heart of ice. And the one thing all hearts of gold have in common? They crave love.â€
I tightened my grip on her, equal parts furious and turned on by her foolish, stubborn goodness.
 â€œWhat did I tell you about romanticizing me?â€
I wanted her, but it wasnâ€™t a sweet, tender kind of want.
It was a dirty, ugly want, tainted by the blood on my hands and a desire to drag her out of the sunshine and into my night.
â€œItâ€™s not romanticizing if itâ€™s true.â€
A growl slipped out of my throat. I allowed myself to hold onto her for one more moment before I pushed her away. â€œGo home, Ava. This isnâ€™t the place for you.â€
â€œIâ€™ll go home when I want to go home.â€
â€œStop being difficult.â€
â€œStop being a jerk.â€
â€œI thought I had a heart of gold,â€ I mocked. â€œChoose a side and stick to it, Sunshine.â€
â€œEven gold can tarnish if you donâ€™t take care of it.â€ Ava stepped back, and I tamped down the ridiculous urge to follow her. â€œI paid for my ticket, and Iâ€™m staying here until I decide I want to leave. Thank you for the dance.â€
She walked away, leaving me in fuming silence.



* * *


I made
 a concerted effort to ignore Ava for the rest of the night, though she hovered in my peripheral vision like a golden spark that wouldnâ€™t go away. Luckily for every man in the room, she didnâ€™t dance with anyone else; she spent most of her time chatting and laughing with alumni.
I spent mine gathering intelâ€”information about congressmen Iâ€™d need if I wanted to expand Archer into a conglomerate, tidbits about competitors, interesting nuggets about friends and foes.
Iâ€™d just wrapped up anâ€¦enlightening conversation with the head of a major consulting company when I lost sight of Ava. One minute she was there; the next, she was gone. She was still gone twenty minutes laterâ€”far too long for a bathroom break.
It was getting late; perhaps sheâ€™d left. We hadnâ€™t parted on the best note, but Iâ€™d check on her to make sure she got home safely. Just in case.
I was already on my way out when I heard a thump from the small room by the ballroom, which served as an overflow space for guestsâ€™ bags and jackets.
â€œGet off
 me!â€
I froze, my blood icing over. I opened the door, and the ice erupted into scalding flames.
Avaâ€™s soon-to-be-dead ex Liam had her pinned against the wall with her wrists above her head. They were so focused on each other they didnâ€™t notice me enter.
â€œYou told me you didnâ€™t have a new man,â€ Liam slurred. â€œBut I saw you dancing and watching him.
 You lied, Ava. Why did you lie?â€
â€œYouâ€™re crazy.â€ Even from here, I saw her eyes flashing fire. â€œLet go of me. I mean it. Or do you want a repeat of last week?â€

Last week?
 What the hell
 happened last week?
â€œBut I love you.â€ His voice turned plaintive. â€œWhy wonâ€™t you love me back? It was one mistake, babe.â€ He pressed his body against hers, preventing her legs from moving. Fire scorched my veins as I stalked over, my approach muffled by the plush carpet beneath my feet. â€œYou do
 still love me. I know it.â€
â€œIâ€™m giving you three seconds to move, or I canâ€™t be held accountable for my actions.â€ A burst of pride shot through me at Avaâ€™s flinty tone. Atta girl.
 â€œOneâ€¦twoâ€¦three.â€
Iâ€™d just reached them when she head-butted him. A howl ripped out of his throat; he stumbled back, clutching his nose, which now gushed blood.
â€œYou broke my nose!â€ he spat. â€œYou asked for it, you slut.â€ He lunged for her, but he only made it halfway before I closed my fist around the back of his shirt and yanked him back.
It was only then that Ava noticed me. â€œAlex. Whatâ€”â€
â€œMind if I join the fun?â€ I hauled Liam up by his collar, my lip curling at the sight of his watering eyes and bleeding nose, and socked him in the gut. â€œThatâ€™s for calling her a slut.â€ Another blow to the jaw. â€œThatâ€™s for holding her against her will.â€ A third hit to his already-suffering nose. â€œThatâ€™s for cheating on her.â€
I continued my blows, letting the fire wash over me until Liam was unconscious and Ava had to drag me off him.
â€œAlex, stop. Youâ€™ll kill him!â€
I adjusted my shirtsleeves, breathing hard. â€œIs that supposed to deter me?â€
I could go all night and not stop until the bastard was nothing more than a pile of bloodied flesh and broken bones. A film of red tinted my vision, and my knuckles were bruised from the force of my blows.
The image of him pinning Ava against the wall flashed through my mind, and my anger erupted anew.
â€œLetâ€™s just go. He learned his lesson, and if someone sees you, youâ€™ll get in trouble.â€ Avaâ€™s face was the color of porcelain. â€œPlease.â€
â€œHe wouldnâ€™t dare say anything.â€ Nevertheless, I relented because of how bad she was trembling. Despite her toughness earlier, Ava was shaken up over the incident. Plus, she was right; we were lucky no one had stumbled in on us yet. I didnâ€™t give a shit if they did, but there was no need to drag out an already unpleasant evening.
â€œWe should call an ambulance.â€ She eyed Liamâ€™s prone form with unease. â€œWhat if heâ€™s seriously hurt?â€
Of course she still cared about his well-being after he tried to fucking assault her. I didnâ€™t know whether to laugh in disbelief or shake her.
â€œHe wonâ€™t die.â€ Iâ€™d controlled my hits so they were punishing but not fatal. â€œHeâ€™ll wake up with a helluva banged-up face and a couple of broken ribs, but heâ€™ll survive.â€ Unfortunately.

The worry remained on Avaâ€™s face. â€œWe should call 911 anyway.â€
For fuckâ€™s sake. â€œIâ€™ll place an anonymous call from the car.â€ I had a burner phone in the glove compartment.
I placed a steadying hand on the small of her back as we exited the hotel. Thankfully, we didnâ€™t pass anyone except the doorman along the way. â€œNow.â€ I pinned Ava with a glare. â€œTell me what the hell
 happened between you two last week.â€

Ava






He was furious.

He was alive with it, pulsing with it. One hand clutched the steering wheel, knuckles white, while the other rested on the gearshift, flexing and unflexing like he wanted to strangle someone. The glow from passing streetlights illuminated the beautifully carved planes of his face as we sped down the dark streets, throwing into sharp relief the tense set of his mouth and the way his brows bunched over his eyes.
When I told him about the incident with Liam outside The Crypt, I almost disintegrated from the force of his fury.
â€œIâ€™m okay,â€ I said, wrapping my arms around my torso. My voice sounded scratchy and unsure. â€œReally.â€
That only made him more furious.
â€œIf youâ€™d attended Krav Maga lessons like Iâ€™d asked, he wouldnâ€™t have been able to corner you like that.â€ Alexâ€™s voice was soft. Deadly. I remembered his face when heâ€™d pounded Liamâ€™s face into a pulp, and a shiver skated down my spine. I wasnâ€™t scared of Alex hurting me, but the sight of all that coiled strength unleashed was unnerving. â€œYou have to learn to protect yourself. If anything had happened to you...â€
â€œI defended myself fine.â€ I pressed my lips together. I hadnâ€™t seen Liam at the gala, but there had been so many people it wouldâ€™ve been impossible for me to pick him out in the crowd. Bridget had finagled me an invite to the ball so I could connect with an alumnus whoâ€™d been a WYP fellow a few years ago. Weâ€™d had a great conversation, but I tired of the small talk with the rest of the galaâ€™s guests and had been on my way out when Liam cornered me in the coatroom.
Heâ€™d been high tonight, too. Iâ€™d seen it in his dilated pupils and manic energy. He never used drugs when we were together, at least not that I knew of, but whatever he was on, it made him swing between bouts of rage and sadness.
Despite what he did and things heâ€™d said, I couldnâ€™t help feeling sorry for him.
â€œThis time.â€ Alexâ€™s jaw flexed. â€œWho knows what might happen the next time youâ€™re alone?â€
I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could get the words out, images and sounds slammed into my brain, rendering me mute.

I threw a stone into the lake and giggled at the ripples that spread over the smooth surface.


The lake was my favorite part of our backyard. We had a dock that ran out to the middle of the water, and during the summers, Josh would cannonball off it while Daddy fished and Mommy read magazines and I skipped stones. Josh always teased me about not being able to swim, much less cannonball.


I would, though. Mommy signed me up for swimming lessons, and I would be the best swimmer in the world. Better than Josh, who thought he was the best at everything.


Iâ€™d show him.


My mouth turned down at the corners. There would be no more summers by the lakeside with all of us, though. Not since Daddy moved out and took Josh with him.


I missed them. It got lonely sometimes, especially since Mommy didnâ€™t play with me like she used to. All she did now was yell into the phone and cry. Sometimes, she sat in the kitchen and just stared into space.


It made me sad. I tried to cheer her upâ€”I drew her pictures and even gave her Bethany, my nicest, bestest doll to play with, but it didnâ€™t work. She still cried.


Today was a better day, though. It was our first time playing by the lake since Daddy moved out, so maybe it meant she felt better. Sheâ€™d gone into the house for more sunscreenâ€”she always worried about freckles and stuff like thatâ€”but when she got back, I planned to ask her to play with me like we used to.


I picked up another stone from the ground. It was smooth and flat, the type that would make
 really pretty ripples. I drew my arm back to throw it, but I smelled something floweryâ€”Mommyâ€™s perfumeâ€”that distracted me.


My aim veered and the stone thudded onto the ground, but I didnâ€™t mind. Mommy was back! We could play now.


I turned, smiling a big gap-toothed smileâ€”my front tooth fell out last week, and I found five dollars from the Tooth Fairy under my pillow after, which was super coolâ€”but I only made it halfway before she pushed me. I pitched forwardâ€”down, down, off the edge of the deck, my scream swallowed up by the water rushing toward my face.

Reality yanked me back into the present with jarring force. I bent over double, chest heaving, tears streaming down my face. When had I started crying?

It didnâ€™t matter. All that mattered was I was
 crying. Huge, heaving sobs, the kind that made my nose all snotty and my stomach hurt. Thick, salty rivulets ran down my cheeks and dripped off my chin onto the floor.
Maybe Iâ€™d finally broken, split apart for the world to see. Iâ€™d always known I wasnâ€™t normal, me with my forgotten childhood and fragmented nightmares, but Iâ€™d been able to hide it behind smiles and laughter. Until now.
My nightmares were usually confined to when I was sleeping. They had never consumed me when I was awake.
Maybe the adrenaline rush from what happened with Liam triggered something in my brain. If I had to worry about my waking hours and
 my sleeping onesâ€¦
I pressed the heels of my palms to my eyes. I was losing it.
A cool, strong hand touched my shoulder.
I jerked, remembering in a rush that I wasnâ€™t alone. That someone bore witness to my sudden, humiliating breakdown. I also hadnâ€™t noticed that Alex had pulled over to the side of the road until now.
If heâ€™d been furious before, he was crazed now. Not in a psycho, angry wayâ€”well, maybe a littleâ€”but more in a panicked way. His eyes were wild, that muscle in his jaw jumping so fast it had a life of his own. Iâ€™d never seen him like that. Pissed, yes. Annoyed, definitely. But not like that.

Like he wanted to burn the world down at seeing me hurt.
My naÃ¯ve heart sang, cutting a swath of hope through my lingering panic. Because no one looks at someone like that unless they care, and I realized that I wanted Alex Volkov to care. Very much.
I wanted him to care because of me,
 not because of a promise heâ€™d made to my brother.
Talk about a terrible time to come to such a realization. I was a freaking mess, and heâ€™d just beat the living daylights out of my ex-boyfriend.
I sucked in a shaky breath and wiped the tears from my face with the backs of my hands.
â€œI will destroy him.â€ Alexâ€™s words sliced through the air like lethal blades of ice. Goosebumps blossomed on my skin and I shivered, my teeth chattering from the cold. â€œEverything he has ever touched, everyone he has ever loved. I will ruin them until theyâ€™re nothing more than a pile of ashes at your feet.â€
I shouldâ€™ve been terrified by the leashed violence flickering in the car, but I felt oddly safe. I always felt safe around him.
â€œIâ€™m not crying because of Liam.â€ I took a deep breath. â€œLetâ€™s not talk or think about him anymore, okay? Letâ€™s salvage the rest of the night. Please.â€
I needed to take my mind off everything that happened tonight, or Iâ€™d scream.
A few beats passed before Alex relaxed his shoulders, though his face remained tight. â€œWhat do you have in mind?â€
â€œFood would be good.â€ Iâ€™d been too nervous to eat at the gala, and I was starving. â€œSomething greasy and bad for you. Youâ€™re not one of those health nuts, are you?â€
His body was so cut he looked like he subsisted on lean protein and green shakes.
Disbelief shadowed his eyes before he let out a short laugh. â€œNo, Sunshine, Iâ€™m not one of those health nuts.â€
Ten minutes later, we pulled up in front of a diner that looked like it served nothing but
 food that was bad for you.
Perfect.
Heads swiveled in our direction when we walked into the diner. I couldnâ€™t blame them. It isnâ€™t every day you see a duo in black-tie enter a roadside diner. Iâ€™d tried my best to fix myself so I was presentable before I left the car, but thereâ€™s only so much a girl can do without her makeup bag.
Something warm and silky enveloped me, and I realized Alex had taken off his jacket and draped it over my shoulders.
â€œItâ€™s cold,â€ he said when I shot him a questioning look. He glared at a group of guys who were ogling meâ€”or rather, my breastsâ€”from a nearby table.
I didnâ€™t protest. It was
 cold, and my gown didnâ€™t cover much.
I also didnâ€™t protest when Alex insisted we sit in the back and positioned me in the booth facing the wall, so I was out of the other dinersâ€™ sight.
We placed our orders, and I shifted beneath the weight of his stare.
â€œTell me what happened in the car.â€ For once, his tone was gentle, not commanding. â€œIf not Liam, what made youâ€¦â€
â€œFreak out?â€ I fiddled with a loose strand of hair. No one knew about my lost memories or nightmares except my family and closest friends, but I had a strange urge to spill the truth to Alex. â€œI had aâ€¦flashback. Of something that happened when I was young.â€ Iâ€™d been in denial all these years, telling myself they were fictional nightmares instead of fragmented flashbacks, but I couldnâ€™t lie any longer.
I swallowed hard before I told Alex, in halting sentences, about my pastâ€”or what I remembered of it. It wasnâ€™t the lighthearted conversation Iâ€™d envisioned when Iâ€™d suggested we â€œsalvage the rest of the night,â€ but I felt ten times lighter by the time I finished.
â€œThey told me it was my mom,â€ I said. â€œMy parents were going through a nasty divorce, and apparently, my mom had some sort of breakdown and pushed me into the lake, knowing I couldnâ€™t swim. I wouldâ€™ve
 drowned had my dad not come by to drop off some papers and seen what happened. He saved me, and my momâ€™s condition deteriorated further until she killed herself. They told me I was lucky to be alive butâ€¦â€ I drew in a shuddering breath. â€œSometimes, I donâ€™t feel lucky.â€
Alex had listened patiently the entire time, but his eyes flickered dangerously at my last statement. â€œDonâ€™t say that.â€
â€œI know. Itâ€™s super self-pitying, which is not what I want. But what you said at the gala earlier? About me craving love? Youâ€™re right.â€ My chin wobbled. Call me crazy, but something about being tucked away this corner of a random diner, sitting across from a man who I thought didnâ€™t even like me until a few hours ago, made me voice my most insidious thoughts. â€œMy mom tried to kill me. My dad barely pays attention to me. Parents are supposed to be the most loving forces in their childrenâ€™s lives, butâ€¦â€ A tear slipped down my cheek, and my voice broke. â€œI donâ€™t know what I did wrong. Maybe if I tried harder to be a good daughterâ€”â€
â€œStop.â€ Alexâ€™s hand curled around mine on the table. â€œDonâ€™t blame yourself for fucked-up things other people do.â€
â€œI try not to, butâ€¦â€ Another shaky breath. â€œThatâ€™s why Liam cheating on me hurt so much. I wasnâ€™t really in love with him, so I wasnâ€™t heartbroken per se, but heâ€™s yet another person who was supposed to love me but didnâ€™t.â€ My chest ached. If I wasnâ€™t the problem, why did this keep happening to me? I tried to be a good person. A good daughter, good girlfriendâ€¦but no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up hurt.
I had Josh and my friends, but there was a difference between platonic love and the deep bonds that bound a person to their parents and significant other. At least, there was supposed to be.
â€œLiam is an idiot and an asshole,â€ Alex said flatly. â€œIf you let lesser people determine your self-worth, youâ€™ll never reach higher than their limited imagination.â€ He leaned forward, his expression intense. â€œYou donâ€™t have to work overtime to get people to love you, Ava. Love isnâ€™t earned, itâ€™s given.â€
My heart rattled in my chest. â€œI thought you didnâ€™t believe in love.â€
â€œPersonally? No. But love is like money. Its worth is determined by those who believe in it. And you obviously do.â€
Such a cynical, Alex way to look at it, but I appreciated his straightforwardness.
â€œThank you,â€ I said. â€œFor listening to me andâ€¦everything.â€
He released my hand, and I curled it into a light fist, mourning his warmth.
â€œIf you really want to thank me, youâ€™ll take Krav Maga lessons.â€ Alex arched an eyebrow, and I laughed softly, grateful for the small break. Itâ€™d been a heavy night.
â€œOkay, but you have to sit for a portrait with me.â€
The idea came to me on a whim, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized Iâ€™d never wanted to photograph someone as much as I wanted to photograph Alex. I wanted to peel back those layers and reveal the fire I knew beat within that cold, beautiful chest.
Alexâ€™s nostrils flared. â€œYouâ€™re negotiating with me.â€
â€œYes.â€ I held my breath, hoping, prayingâ€¦
â€œFine. One session.â€
I couldnâ€™t hold back my smile.
I was right. Alex Volkov did have a multilayered heart.

Ava






I agonized
 for days over whether to shoot Alex in a studio or outdoors.
I took all of my photoshoots seriously, but this one felt different. More intimate. Moreâ€¦life-changing, like it had the power to make or break me, and not just because I might submit it as part of my portfolio for the WYP fellowship.
I would have Alex Volkov all to myself for two hours, and I wouldnâ€™t squander a single second.
I eventually chose to shoot him in a studio. I booked the space in the universityâ€™s photography building and waited, pulse thumping, for him to arrive.
I was more nervous than I should be, but maybe that had something to do with the wildly inappropriate dream Iâ€™d had last night. One that featured me, Alex, and positions that would make an acrobatâ€™s jaw drop.
Even now, I flushed at the memory.
To stave off the onslaught of unbidden, erotic images, I fiddled with my camera and stared outside the window, where hints of fall bloomed on the trees and leaves swirled lazily on soft gusts of wind. Red, yellow, orangeâ€”fire on air. A physical marker of the transition from the hot, halcyon days of summer to the icy, bone-chilling beauty of winter.
It was September, but a different kind of winter whooshed in on a cloud of delicious spice and cool reserve.
Alex entered the room, cutting a sleek, powerful figure in his all-black outfitâ€”black coat, black pants, black shoes, black leather gloves. A sharp contrast to the pale beauty of his face.
My fingers tightened around my camera. My creative soul salivated, desperate to capture that mystery and lay it bare on the page.
Iâ€™ve found that the quietest, most reserved people often make the best portrait subjects because the exercise doesnâ€™t require them to speak; it requires them to feel.
 Those who bottle up their emotions every day feel the strongest and love the hardest; the best photographers are the ones who can capture each drop of emotion as it spills out and mold it into something visceral, relatable. Universal.
Alex and I didnâ€™t greet each other. No words, not so much as a nod.
Instead, the air hummed with silence as he divested himself of his coat and gloves. It wasnâ€™t overtly sexual, but everything
 about the man was sexual. The way his strong, deft fingers slid each button from its hole without so much as a pause or stumble; the way his shoulders and arms flexed beneath his shirt as he hung his coat on the hook by the door; the way he moved toward me like a panther stalking its prey, his eyes bright with scorching intensity.
The velvety tips of butterfly wings brushed my heart, and I clutched my camera tighter, willing myself not to step back or tremble. Liquid warmth pooled in my stomach, and every inch of my body became a nerve ending, hypersensitized and throbbing with arousal.
He hadnâ€™t touched me, and I was already so turned on I trembled. I hadnâ€™t thought that was possible outside romance novels and movies.
Those green eyes flared, like he knew exactly what he did to me. How tight my nipples were beneath my thick sweater, how wet I was between my thighs. How much I wanted to devour him, to pour myself into the cracks of his soul so he would never be alone.
â€œWhere do you want me?â€ Gravel rasped his voice for the first time since Iâ€™d met him, turning the clear, authoritative tone into something darker. More sinful.
Where did I want him? Everywhere. Over me. Beneath me. Inside me.

I licked my suddenly dry lips. Alexâ€™s gaze dropped to my mouth, and my entire body pulsed.

No.
 I wasnâ€™t a schoolgirl on a date. I was a professional. This
 was professional.
A portrait session with a subject, just like countless other sessions Iâ€™d had in the past.
Of course, I hadnâ€™t wanted to throw any of my previous subjects on the floor and ride them until kingdom come, but that was a minor detail.
â€œUh, here is fine,â€ I croaked, gesturing to the stool Iâ€™d set up on a plain white background.
Iâ€™d kept todayâ€™s set up simple. I didnâ€™t want anything to detract from Alex, not that they could. His presence obliterated everything around him until he was the only thing left standing.
He folded himself gracefully on the stool while I checked my settings and snapped a few test shots. Even unposed, his photos jumped off the screen, his gorgeous features and piercing eyes tailor-made for the camera.
I reigned in my shameless lust and spent the next hour coaxing him out of his shell, moving him into various poses, and encouraging him to relax.
I wasnâ€™t sure Alex understood the meaning of the word.
The pictures so far were beautiful, but they lacked emotion. Without emotion, a beautiful photo is just a photo.
I attempted to open him up with chitchat, talking to him about everything from the weather to Joshâ€™s latest update to that dayâ€™s news, but he remained aloof and guarded.
I tried a different tactic. â€œTell me about your happiest memory.â€
Alexâ€™s lips thinned. â€œI thought this was a photoshoot, not a therapy session.â€
â€œIf it were a therapy session, Iâ€™d be charging you five hundred dollars an hour,â€ I quipped.
â€œYou have an inflated sense of your worth as a therapist.â€
â€œIf you canâ€™t afford me, just say so.â€ I snapped more pictures. Finally
 . A sign of life.
The click and whir of the shutter filled the air.
â€œSweetheart, I could get you with a snap of my fingers, and I wouldnâ€™t have to shell out a single penny.â€
I lowered my camera and glared at him. â€œWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?â€
A tiny smirk tugged at the corner of Alexâ€™s mouth. â€œIt means you want me. You wear your emotions all over your face.â€
My thighs clenched, and my skin burned until I thought Iâ€™d collapse into a pile of ashes on the ground.
â€œNow whoâ€™s the one with an inflated sense of self-worth?â€ I managed, my heart racing. Alex had never said anything so direct to me before. He usually shut down any hint of attraction between us, but here he was, talking about me wanting him.
He was right, but still.
Alex leaned forward and clasped his hands loosely together. Graceful, casual but alert. Waiting to lure me into his trap.
â€œTell me itâ€™s not true.â€
I licked my lips again, my throat parched, and his gaze zeroed in on my mouth. The small but unmistakable movement bolstered my confidence and compelled me to say something I wouldâ€™ve never had the guts to say otherwise. â€œItâ€™s true.â€ I almost smiled at the flare of surprise in his eyes. He hadnâ€™t expected honesty. â€œBut you want me too. Question is, are you too scared to admit it?â€
Alexâ€™s thick, dark brows lowered. â€œIâ€™m not scared of anything.â€

Lies.
 I wouldâ€™ve believed him a month ago, but now I knew better. Everyone fears something; itâ€™s what makes us human. And Alex Volkovâ€”for all his control, all his powerâ€”was still wonderfully, frighteningly, heartbreakingly human.
â€œThat doesnâ€™t answer my question.â€ I walked over to him, my camera swaying from the strap looped around my neck. He didnâ€™t move an inch, not even when I brushed my fingers along his jaw. â€œAdmit you want me, too.â€
I wasnâ€™t sure where my boldness came from. I wasnâ€™t Jules. I always waited for the guy to ask me outâ€”partly out of fear of rejection, partly because I was too shy to make the first move.
But I had a feeling if I waited for Alex, I might have to wait forever.
It was time to take matters into my own hands
â€œIf I wanted you, I wouldâ€™ve taken you already,â€ Alex said with lethal softness.
â€œUnless youâ€™re too scared.â€
I was playing with fire, but that was better than standing out in the cold alone.
I stiffened when Alex trailed his fingers down my neck and over my shoulder. His lips curved into a smirk. â€œNervous? I thought this was what you wanted,â€ he taunted. His hand dipped lower, closer to the curve of my breast. The ice pools in his eyes melted, revealing a blazing inferno that heated me from head to toe.
My head spun. My nipples tightened into firm beads, and my pulse throbbed through every inch of my body. Somehow, it was worse
 that he wasnâ€™t touching me where I ached most; the anticipation heightened my senses, and my skin tingled with phantom caresses.
â€œThatâ€™s not what I said,â€ I wheezed. Oh God, this was embarrassing. What had I been thinking? I wasnâ€™t a femme fatale or aâ€¦aâ€¦whatever else was like a femme fatale.
I couldnâ€™t think straight.
Alex grazed his thumb over my breast, and I moaned. Moaned.
 From a touch that lasted less than two seconds.
I wanted to die.
His pupils dilated until the green irises were eclipses ringed with jade fire. He dropped his hand, and cool air rushed in to replace the warmth of his touch.
â€œFinish the photoshoot, Ava.â€ The roughness of his voice scraped against my skin.
â€œWhat?â€ I was too shocked by the sudden change in the atmosphere to process his words.
â€œThe photoshoot. Finish it,â€ he gritted out. â€œUnless you want to start something youâ€™re not ready to finish.â€
â€œIâ€”â€ The photoshoot. Right.
I backed away on unsteady legs and tried to refocus on the task at hand. Alex sat straight-backed, his face hard, while I circled him and captured every angle I could think of.
The low hum of the heater was the only sound breaking the silence.
â€œOkay. Weâ€™re done,â€ I said after twenty minutes of excruciating quiet. â€œThanksâ€”â€
Alex stood, grabbed his coat, and walked out without another word.
â€œFor doing this,â€ I finished, my words echoing in the empty room.
I exhaled a long-held breath. Alex was the most mercurial person I knew. One minute, he was gentle and protective; the next, he was closed-off and distant.
I scrolled through the photos, curious as to how theyâ€™d turned out.

Oh. Wow.
 Alexâ€™s emotions leaped off the screen after ourâ€¦interaction, and yes, most of it was irritation, but irritation on him looked better than contentment on anyone else. The way the shadows hit the sharp lines of his brows, the glare of his eyes, the set of his jawâ€¦these were possibly the best photos Iâ€™d ever taken.
I paused at one of the last shots, and my heart stuttered to a stop.
Iâ€™d been so busy snapping away I hadnâ€™t paid attention in the moment, but now I saw it clear as day. Stark desire scrawled across Alexâ€™s face as he stared at me, his eyes burning through the camera and straight into my soul. It was the only photo where he wore that expression, so it mustâ€™ve been a momentary slip on his part.
A stripping of his mask, if only for a few seconds.
But hereâ€™s the thing: even a few seconds can change someoneâ€™s life. And as I turned off the camera and packed up my equipment with shaky hands, I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that mine had been altered forever.

Alex






â€œItâ€™ll be
 over in a few months.â€ I leaned back in my chair and rolled my whiskey glass in my hands, watching dust mites dance in the air before me.
â€œHmmm.â€ My uncle rubbed his jaw, his eyes sharp as he examined me through the screen. Iâ€™d turned the guest room into my home office, as I preferred to work from home on the days I didnâ€™t have
 to be in the office. Fewer tiresome interactions that way. â€œYou donâ€™t seem excited for someone whoâ€™s been working toward this since you were ten.â€
â€œExcitement is overrated. All I care about is that itâ€™ll be done.â€
Despite my words, my chest pinched, because my uncle was right. I should
 feel excited. Vengeance was so close I could taste it, but instead of sweet relief, it coated my tongue with bitterness and turned my stomach sour.
What came after vengeance?
Every other purpose I could have paled in comparison to the force that had driven me all these years. Itâ€™d held me together while I shattered on the inside. Itâ€™d revived me as I lay bleeding, comatose in a pool of guilt and horror. Itâ€™d created the chessboard on which Iâ€™d painstakingly lined up all the pieces one by one, year over year until the moment came for me to topple the king.
I didnâ€™t fear much, but I feared what would happen after I lost my purpose.
â€œSpeaking of doneâ€¦â€ I set my glass on the table. â€œI assume you signed the papers for the Gruppmann deal today.â€
Ivan smiled. â€œCongratulations. Youâ€™re one step closer to world domination.â€
Me. Because Archer Group had always been mine.
Iâ€™d funded its inception with my money, and the company had flourished under my guidance over the years. My father had started his own successful construction company after immigrating to the U.S., and itâ€™d been his dream to see me take it over one day. The company had collapsed in the wake of his deathâ€”Iâ€™d been too young to prevent its demiseâ€”but Iâ€™d built upon his legacy and created something new. Something bigger.
All my parents had wanted was for me to grow up happy and successful. While the â€œhappyâ€ part may be a reach, I could damn well work on the â€œsuccessfulâ€ part.
After my uncle and I wrapped up our weekly check-in, I opened my burner laptop and pulled up the encrypted folder where I kept all the documents detailing my enemyâ€™s finances, business dealingsâ€”both legal and illegalâ€”and upcoming contracts. Iâ€™d chipped away at his empire over the years, slow enough that he thought he was just going through a long string of shitty luck. Now I needed just one more piece of evidence before I felled him for good.
I stared at the screen, the numbers blurring before my eyes as I envisioned my endgame. The prospect didnâ€™t excite me as much as it used to.
At least Iâ€™d taken satisfaction in the fall of Liam Brooks. A few well-placed calls, and heâ€™d been fired and blacklisted from every company that mattered in the northeastern United States. A few whispers in the right ears, and heâ€™d landed on D.C. societyâ€™s blacklist. Honestly, Iâ€™d just sped up his inevitable fall from graceâ€”according to the information my people dug up, Liam had picked up a nasty drug habit and several DUIs since graduating. It was only a matter of time before he fucked up at his job or pissed off the wrong people on his own.
He was a man whoâ€™d had everything handed to him on a silver platter, and he threw it away for a temporary high. Excuse me while I cry a nonexistent river.

Then again, heâ€™d cheated on Ava, so he clearly lacked the good-judgment gene.
My phone pinged with a social media notification. I despised social media, but it was the worldâ€™s biggest goldmine of information. It was amazing how much personal information people shared online with little to no regard for who might be watching.
I tapped on the notification so it would go away and accidentally clicked into the app, where a shaky video of two people arguing auto-played. I was about to exit when I paused. Looked closer.

Fuck!

The video was still playing when I left and sped toward Madelineâ€™s house.

Ava






Of all the
 ways Iâ€™d pictured my Friday night going, getting trapped in a pool room by a blonde who eyed me like Iâ€™d stolen her favorite Prada purse wasnâ€™t one of them.
â€œIâ€™m sorry, do I know you?â€ I strove for politeness even as I took a step back. The woman looked familiar, but I couldnâ€™t place where Iâ€™d seen her before.
â€œI donâ€™t believe weâ€™ve met.â€ Her smile couldâ€™ve cut glass. Objectively, she was one of the most beautiful women Iâ€™d ever met. With her spun-gold hair, cerulean eyes, and statuesque body, she was what I imagined Aphrodite would look like had she been a real person. But there was something hard about her expression that made her not attractive at all. â€œMadeline Hauss of the petrochemical Hausses. This is my house.â€
â€œOh. Iâ€™m Ava. Chen,â€ I added when she continued staring at me. â€œOf the, uh, Maryland Chens. Can Iâ€¦help you?â€ I hoped that didnâ€™t come off rude, considering this was her house, but I hadnâ€™t wanted to attend this party in the first place. Stella, who was friends with what must be Madelineâ€™s sister, had persuaded me to go out after I spent the past few days buried in school, work, and my fellowship application. Jules and Bridget were both busy tonight, so it was only the two of us.
â€œI wanted a good look at you,â€ Madeline purred. â€œSince you captured so much of Alexâ€™s attention during the gala.â€

The gala.
 Of course. This was the woman Iâ€™d seen Alex talking to while I danced with Colton. Iâ€™d tried not to look, but I couldnâ€™t help staring and comparing myself to her the whole time.
To Julesâ€™s dismay, Iâ€™d nixed the jealousy part of Operation Emotion, but Iâ€™d admittedly used Colton to make Alex jealous at the gala. It was stupid and petty, but Colton had shown up around the same time I saw Alex with Madeline, and Iâ€™d been so consumed with jealousy myself I went for it. Judging by Alexâ€™s reaction when he saw us dancing, it had workedâ€”a little too well, judging by Madelineâ€™s glare.
â€œI didnâ€™t realize you knew Alex,â€ I fibbed. My stomach churned, and not because of Madelineâ€™s poisonous tone.
The Haussesâ€™ pool room looked like a luxurious, modern Roman bath, all white marble and gilded columns. The pool itself gleamed turquoise beneath a glass dome that revealed the night sky in all its glory, and I spotted the colorful swirl of mosaics beneath the water forming the shape of a mermaid. But the smell of chlorine and sight of all that waterâ€¦
My dinner rose in my throat.
The Hausses lived in a giant house in Bethesda, and Stella and I had spent the night room hopping, enjoying the different music and entertainment options in each space. While Stella left to find us fresh drinks, Iâ€™d wandered into the room next to the one weâ€™d been in and found myself facing my worst, watery nightmare. Madeline had cornered me before I could leave, and here we were.
â€œOh, I know Alex very
 well,â€ Madeline said, and I knew, with a sickening drop in my stomach, that she was one of the â€œcertain womenâ€ heâ€™d been involved with. Were they still involved? Was she the one heâ€™d almost gone on a date with before I ambushed him for movie night?
Jealousy gnawed at me, almost overpowering my nausea from the chlorine.
â€œWhat I donâ€™t get is why he would be interested in you.
 â€ She flicked her gaze over me. â€œI doubt you can keep up with his tastes in the bedroom.â€
Despite myself, curiosity reared its ugly head. What tastes?
 â€œYouâ€™d be surprised,â€ I bluffed, hoping sheâ€™d reveal more information.
My mind flashed back to my sex dream starring Alex, and my heart raced.
Madeline smirked. â€œPlease. You look like the type who expects tender kisses and sweet nothings in bed. But as you probably knowâ€”â€ Her smirk turned vicious. â€œAlex doesnâ€™t do either of those things. Itâ€™s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.â€™s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex.â€ She lowered her head so she could whisper in my ear. â€œBut he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.â€ She straightened, her eyes gleaming with triumph at my scarlet face. â€œSome women like that. Youâ€¦â€ She looked me over again with a laugh. â€œGo back to your bake sales, honey. Youâ€™re way out of your league.â€
My body throbbed at her words, both out of anger at her condescension and stunning arousal at the picture sheâ€™d painted.
We were attracting attention. Other partygoers gathered around us, hungry for drama. A few even had their phones out, recording. I guessed Madeline was the draw, because I wasnâ€™t well-known enough to be that interesting.
â€œMaybe,â€ I said, matching the blondeâ€™s honey-laced poison. â€œHe just doesnâ€™t like looking at you
 during sex. Because heâ€™s never had that problem with me.â€

Lies.
 But she didnâ€™t need to know that.
I kept my head above the fray best I can, but I could play dirty when the situation called for it.
Madelineâ€™s smile disappeared. â€œHeâ€™ll be sick of you in a week. Thereâ€™s only so much sugar a man like Alex can take before he gets a stomachache.â€
â€œAnd thereâ€™s only so much bitterness he can take before he kicks it to the curb.â€ I raised my eyebrows. â€œBut you already know that, donâ€™t you?â€ I wasnâ€™t sure where my sass came from, since I wasnâ€™t a sassy person, but Madeline brought out all my claws.
I hated being the type of girl who fought with other girls over a guy, but sheâ€™d attacked me first. I wouldnâ€™t stand here and let her walk all over me.
Madelineâ€™s creamy skin flushed with anger. â€œAre you calling me bitter?â€

Walk away,
 my better angels encouraged me. I almost did, until I pictured Madeline and Alex together, and the words fell out of my mouth. â€œYes, and? What are you going to do about it?â€
Childish. So freakinâ€™ childish. But the taunt was out there, and I couldnâ€™tâ€”
My mind blanked when my body pitched backward and hit the pool with a splash.
Sheâ€™d pushed me. Into the pool.

The pool.


Ohgodohgodohgod.

Grotesque, echoing laughter broke out, but it sounded dim compared to the roaring in my ears. Shock and panic suffused me, freezing my limbs, and all I could do was stare at Madelineâ€™s twisted smirk until my face sank beneath the water.

Iâ€™m going to die.

Alex






â€œWhere is she?â€
 I grasped Madeline by the throat, resisting the urge to squeeze until I wiped the smug look off her face.
Iâ€™d never raised a hand to a woman outside the bedroomâ€”and then only if they consentedâ€”but I was this close to losing my shit.
After I saw the video of Madeline pushing Ava into the pool, which I recognized from my previous visits to the Hauss mansion, I broke every speed limit to get here. By the time I arrived, the party had ended and only a few stragglers remained. I found Madeline laughing with her cronies in the kitchen, but it had only taken a glare from me for her to excuse herself and follow me into the hall.
â€œWhy donâ€™t you tighten your hold a little?â€ she purred. â€œYou know you want to.â€
â€œIâ€™m not here to play games.â€ I was holding onto my patience by a thread. â€œAnswer my question, or Hauss Industries is over.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t have that kind of power.â€
â€œDonâ€™t underestimate me, sweetheart.â€ It wasnâ€™t an endearment. â€œJust because weâ€™ve fucked a few times doesnâ€™t mean you know whatâ€”or whoâ€”I have in my back pocket. So unless you want to explain to dear old Dad why regulators are breathing down his neck and his precious company stock is tanking, I suggest you answer me. Now.â€
Madelineâ€™s lips compressed into a thin line. â€œHer friend pulled her out of the pool, and they left,â€ she said, sullen. â€œHow was I supposed to know she canâ€™t swim?â€
My grip tightened, and my lips curled into a sneer when I saw the resulting flare of desire in her eyes. â€œPray sheâ€™s all right, or the downfall of Hauss Industries will be the least of your worries,â€ I said softly. â€œDo not contact or come near her or me again. Understand?â€
Madeline lifted her chin in defiance.
â€œDo. You. Understand.â€ I pressed my thumb into the soft flesh of her neckâ€”not enough to injure, but enough to make her flinch.
â€œYes,â€ she choked out, resentment coating her voice.
â€œGood.â€ I released her and walked away, keeping my steps calm when all I wanted was to race to Avaâ€™s house and check if she was okay. She hadnâ€™t answered any of my calls and texts, and while I understood why, it still made me nervous.
â€œIs she really worth it?â€ Madeline called after me.
I didnâ€™t bother answering her.

Yes.

When I reached my car, I floored the gas and nearly mowed over a group of drunk frat boys. My grip strangled the steering wheel as I imagined how Ava must have felt when she fell into the poolâ€”or how she must feel right now.
A mixture of worry and anger coiled in my stomach. Fuck what I told Madeline earlier. Sheâ€™d put a huge target on her familyâ€™s back, and I wouldnâ€™t rest until Hauss Industries was no more than a footnote in corporate history.
I pulled up to Avaâ€™s house in time to see Stella exiting. I cut the engine and made it to the front door in half a dozen long strides.
â€œHow is she?â€ I demanded.
Worry etched itself on Stellaâ€™s face. â€œShe could be worse, given the circumstances. I was getting us drinks when she went into the pool roomâ€¦â€ She gnawed on her bottom lip. â€œAnyway, I found her when that woman pushed her into the pool. I got her out before she passed out or anything like that, but sheâ€™s pretty shaken. Jules isnâ€™t home yet, and I wanted to stay with her, but she said sheâ€™s going to sleep and insisted I leave.â€ Stellaâ€™s brows knit together. â€œYou should check on her. Just in case.â€
That was a big ask coming from Stella, who liked me the least out of Avaâ€™s friends, and it said a lot about Avaâ€™s current state.
â€œIâ€™ll take it from here.â€ I brushed past her into the living room.
â€œHow did you find out what happened so fast?â€ Stella called after me.
â€œOnline,â€ was all I said. I made a mental note to call my tech guy and have him scrub every trace of the video off the internet. He was the same person I relied on to hack into my competitorsâ€™ computers and dig up offshore accounts. Five years of working together, and there hadnâ€™t been a single leak or job he couldnâ€™t complete. In return, Iâ€™d paid him enough money over the years that he could buy a private island off the coast of Fiji if he wanted.
I took the stairs two at a time until I reached Avaâ€™s room. The light spilling through the crack in the door told me she was still awake, despite what sheâ€™d told Stella.
I rapped my knuckle twice against the wood. â€œItâ€™s Alex.â€
There was a short pause. â€œCome in.â€
Ava sat in bed, her hair damp and her gaze wary as she took me in. Worry edged out my anger when I saw how pale her cheeks were and the way she shivered, even though the heat was on and sheâ€™d tucked herself beneath a thick comforter.
â€œI saw what happened. Some fucker filmed it live on social.â€ I sat on the edge of the bed and resisted the insane urge to tuck her into my chest. â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€
â€œItâ€™s not your fault. Donâ€™t blame yourself for fucked-up things other people do.â€
A smile ghosted my mouth as she threw my words back at me.
â€œYou have terrible taste in women though.â€ Ava sniffled. â€œDo better.â€
â€œMadeline and I are over. We never even started.â€
â€œThatâ€™s not what she told me.â€
I cocked my head at her stiff tone. â€œAre youâ€¦jealous?â€ The thought pleased me more than it shouldâ€™ve.
â€œNo.â€ With her scowl and fluffy gray top, she looked like an angry kitten. â€œAs if. So what if sheâ€™s tall and blonde and looks like a Victoriaâ€™s Secret model? Sheâ€™s a horrible person. Next time I see her, Iâ€™m going Krav Maga on her ass.â€
I bit back a full smile. Ava had attended all of one lesson. Itâ€™d be a while before she went anything on anyoneâ€™s ass, but her indignation was adorable.
â€œShe wonâ€™t be bothering you again.â€ I grew serious. â€œThe poolâ€”â€
â€œI thought I was going to die.â€
I flinched, horror skating through me at the thought.
â€œI thought I was going to die because I canâ€™t swim and I have this stupid phobia and I am so sick of it.
 â€ Ava fisted her covers, her mouth tight. â€œI hate feeling helpless and out of control in my own life. Do you know one of my biggest dreams is to travel the world and I canâ€™t even do that because the idea of flying over an ocean makes me sick?â€ She took a deep, shaky breath. â€œI want to see whatâ€™s out there. The Eiffel Tower, the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China. I want to meet new people and try new things and live life, but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m trapped. When I was in that pool, thinking those were my last momentsâ€¦I realized Iâ€™ve done none of the things I want to do. If I died tomorrow, Iâ€™d die with a lifetime of regrets, and that terrified me even more than the water.â€ She looked up at me, her big brown eyes wide and vulnerable. â€œThatâ€™s why I need you to do something for me.â€
This time, I was the one who swallowed hard. â€œWhat is it, Sunshine?â€
â€œI need you to teach me to swim.â€

Ava






If I had
 to describe Alex Volkov, a litany of words came to mind. Cold. Beautiful. Ruthless. Genius.
â€œPatientâ€ wasnâ€™t one of them. It wasnâ€™t even in the top thousand.
But over the past few weeks, I had to admit I might have to bump it up on the list, because heâ€™d been nothing but
 patient as he guided me through a series of visualization and meditation exercises to prepare me for my first real swimming session.
If youâ€™d told me two months ago that I would be â€œvisualizingâ€ and â€œmeditatingâ€ with Alex freakinâ€™ Volkov, I wouldâ€™ve laughed my ass off, but sometimes reality is stranger than fiction. And you know what? The exercises helped. Iâ€™d visualize myself standing near a body of water, then use deep breathing and relaxation techniques to calm myself. I started small, with pools and ponds, and worked my way up to lakes. Alex also started taking me to bodies of water so I could get more comfortable near them. I even dipped my toe into a pool.
I wasnâ€™t cured of my fear of water, but I could think about it now without having a panic attackâ€”most of the time. The thought of flying over an ocean still made me sick to my stomach, but weâ€™d get there.
The most important thing was, I had hope. If I worked long and hard enough, then maybe one day, I would finally conquer the fear that had haunted me for as long as I could remember.
But that wasnâ€™t the only seismic change in my life. Something had shifted in my relationship with Alex. He was no longer just my brotherâ€™s best friend, but my friend too, though some of the thoughts I had toward him were less than platonic. What Iâ€™d felt during our photoshoot was nothing compared to the fantasies running through my mind now.

He will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.

That was the one snippet from my horrible conversation with Madeline I couldnâ€™t forget. Every time I thought about it, my thighs clenched and warmth flooded my lower belly. I was also ashamed to admit that yes, Iâ€™d masturbated to fantasies of Alex doingâ€¦those things to me more than once.
Not that he would. Heâ€™d been frustratingly composed since my pool incidentâ€”no heated gazes, no lingering touches, no trace of the desire Iâ€™d seen on his face in that photo from our shoot.
I hoped that would change tonight.
â€œIâ€™m nervous.â€ Stella crouched behind the couch; she was so tall she had to bend all the way so her dark curls didnâ€™t peek out from the top. â€œAre you nervous?â€
â€œNo,â€ I lied. I was definitely nervous.
It was Alexâ€™s birthday, and I was throwing him a surprise party. There was every chance he hated both surprises and parties, but I felt compelled to do something
 for him. Besides, no one should be alone on their birthday. Iâ€™d asked Alex what his plans for tonight wereâ€”not letting on that I remembered it was his birthdayâ€”and he said he had business documents to look over.
Business documents. On his birthday.

I donâ€™t think so.

Since I didnâ€™t know any of his friends except Ralph, our Krav Maga instructor, Iâ€™d kept the guest list small. Jules, Stella, Bridget, Booth, and a few other students from the KM Academy hid in Ralphâ€™s living room. Ralph had agreed to host the shindig and trick Alex into thinking it was a casual Halloween get-together for academy regulars; he and Alex should arrive any minute now.
Iâ€™d nixed the costume party ideaâ€”Alex didnâ€™t strike me as a costume sort of guyâ€”but I hoped the party itself was a good idea. Most people liked parties, but he wasnâ€™t most people.
A car door slammed, and my stomach tightened with anticipation. â€œShh! Theyâ€™re here,â€ I said in a loud whisper.
The lingering murmurs in the dark room quieted.
â€œâ€¦help me set up,â€ Ralph said, opening the door and flipping on the light.
We all jumped out. â€œSurprise!â€
I wish Iâ€™d had my camera ready, because the expression on Alexâ€™s face? Priceless. He looked like a frozen mannequin except for his eyes, which moved from the balloons Iâ€™d tied to various pieces of furniture to the handmade poster spelling out Happy birthday, Alex!
 in glittery blue cursive before resting on my face.
â€œHappy birthday!â€ I chirped, trying to tamp down my nerves. I couldnâ€™t tell if he liked or hated the surprise, or if he was indifferent. The man was harder to read than a Latin textbook in the dark.
No response. Alex remained frozen.
Jules came to the rescue, turning on the music and encouraging people to eat and mingle. While the rest of the party scattered, I edged my way toward him and pasted on a bright smile.
â€œFooled you, huh?â€
â€œHow did you know itâ€™s my birthday?â€ Alex peeled off his jacket and tossed it over the back of the couch. At least that meant he was staying.
I shrugged, feeling self-conscious. â€œYouâ€™re Joshâ€™s best friend. Of course I know.â€
He frowned. â€œYouâ€™ve never celebrated my birthday before.â€
â€œThereâ€™s a first time for everything. Câ€™mon.â€ I pulled at his wrist. â€œYouâ€™re twenty-seven! That means you have to take twenty-seven shots.â€
His frown deepened. â€œAbsolutely not.â€
â€œIt was worth a try.â€ I grinned. â€œJust wanted to see if you were dumb enough to do it.â€
â€œAva, Iâ€™m a genius.â€
â€œA humble one too.â€
Alex cracked a smile. Not a big one, but we were getting there.
It took some effort, but he eventually relaxed more and more throughout the night until he was eating and chatting with people like a normal human. Iâ€™d baked him a red velvet cake since he liked red velvet, and we sang â€œHappy Birthdayâ€ while he blew out the candles. All normal stuff.
He did, however, refuse to participate when a half-drunk Ralph broke out his karaoke machine.
â€œCome on!â€ I insisted. â€œYou donâ€™t have to be a good
 singer. Iâ€™m terrible, but I do it anyway. Itâ€™s all in good fun.â€
Alex shook his head. â€œI donâ€™t do anything unless Iâ€™m good at it, but donâ€™t let me stop you.â€
â€œThatâ€™s silly. How can you be good at something unless you practice?â€
He still wouldnâ€™t budge, so I sighed and serenaded the party with an off-key solo rendition of Britney Spearsâ€™ â€œOops I Did It Againâ€ while they cheered me on. Alex lounged on the couch, one arm draped over the back, top few buttons of his shirt unbuttoned. A lazy smile graced his face as he watched me sing my heart out.
He looked so gorgeous and at ease I stumbled over the lyrics, but everyone gave me a standing ovation anyway.
The party wrapped up a few hours later, and I insisted on staying and cleaning up even after Ralph told me heâ€™d take care of it. Everyone offered to pitch in as well, so we split into different groupsâ€”garbage duty, sweeping duty, etcetera.
Alex and I somehow ended up on dish duty together. Ralph didnâ€™t have a dishwasher, so I hand-washed while he dried.
â€œI hope you had a good time,â€ I said, scrubbing caked-on sugar from a plate. â€œSorry if we gave you a heart attack.â€
His chuckle sent the butterflies in my stomach into a tizzy. â€œIt would take more than a surprise party to give me a heart attack.â€ He took the plate from me and wiped it dry before setting it on the dish rack. Seeing Alex do something as domestic as dishes sent another flutter through my system. I have serious issues.
 â€œI had a good time though.â€ He cleared his throat, his cheeks coloring. â€œThis was my first birthday party since my parents died.â€
I froze. Alex had never brought up his parents before, but I knew from Josh theyâ€™d died when he was young, which meant he hadnâ€™t had a birthday party in at least a decade.
My heart ached for him. Not because of the party, but because he could no longer celebrate with his family. For the first time, I realized how lonely Alex must be with no relatives left in the world except for his uncle.
â€œSo what do you usually do on your birthday?â€ I asked in a soft voice.
He shrugged. â€œWork. Grab a drink with Josh. Itâ€™s not a big deal. My parents made it a big deal, but after their death, it seemed pointless.â€
â€œHow didâ€”â€ I stopped myself before I finished the question. A guyâ€™s birthday was not
 the right time to bring up the method of his familyâ€™s death.
Alex answered anyway. â€œThey were murdered.â€ After a beat of hesitation, he added, â€œMy fatherâ€™s business rival ordered the hit and made it look like a home invasion gone wrong. My parents hid me right before the intruders found us, but I sawâ€¦â€ His throat bobbed with a hard swallow. â€œI saw it happen. My mom, dad, and little sister, who didnâ€™t hide in time.â€
Horror suffused me at the thought of someone having to witness their own familyâ€™s murder. â€œIâ€™m so sorry. Thatâ€™sâ€”I have no words.â€
â€œItâ€™s all right. At least they caught the bastards who pulled the trigger.â€
â€œAnd the business rival?â€ I asked softly.
His eye twitched. â€œKarma will get him.â€
My heart weighed heavy in my chest even before something more horrifying occurred to me. â€œYour HSAMâ€”â€
Alex flashed a humorless smile. â€œIs a real bitch. I relive that day every day. Sometimes I think about whether I couldâ€™ve saved them, even though I was just a kid. I used to rage at the unfairness of it all until I realized no one gives a shit. Thereâ€™s no entity out there listening to me yell at them. Thereâ€™s only life and luck, and sometimes both those things deal you a crap hand.â€
Tears stung my eyes. Iâ€™d forgotten all about the dishes; my heart hurt too much.
I stepped closer to Alex, who watched me approach with a tense expression.
â€œSometimes, but not all the time.â€ I heard the faint chatter of other guests in the living room, but they might as well be light-years away. Here, in the kitchen, Alex and I had entered our own little world. â€œThereâ€™s something beautiful waiting for you, Alex. Whether you find it tomorrow or years from now, I hope itâ€™ll restore your faith in life. You deserve all the beauty and light in the world.â€
I meant every word. Beneath the icy shell, he was human like everyone else, and his broken heart broke mine a hundredfold.
â€œThere you go, romanticizing me again.â€ Alex didnâ€™t move as I took another step toward him, but his eyes burned with intensity. â€œItâ€™s too late for me, Sunshine. I destroy everything beautiful that comes into my life.â€
â€œI donâ€™t believe that,â€ I said. â€œAnd that wasnâ€™t romanticizing you. This is.â€
Before I could lose my nerve, I stood on tiptoes and kissed him.
It was a soft, chaste kiss, but the effect was the same as a full-on make out session. Sparks consumed my skin, and the heat in my stomach flared to life. I shuddered at the sensation, my pulse beating so wildly I couldnâ€™t hear anything else. Alexâ€™s lips were cool and firm, his taste like that of spice and red velvet, and I wanted to wrap myself around him and devour him until every bit of him was inside me.
Alex remained still, his chest rising and falling with harsh breaths beneath my tentative touch. I pressed a firmer hand against his chest and ran my tongue along the seam of his lips, seeking entryâ€”
I gasped when Alex yanked me toward him and deepened the kiss. His hand fisted my hair and tugged, forcing my back to arch while his tongue plundered my mouth.
â€œNot the romance you were thinking of, is it?â€ he growled, his grip so tight my eyes watered. Heâ€™d spun me around so the edge of the counter dug into my flesh, and he used his other hand to hitch my leg up around his waist. His thick erection pressed against my core, and I ground against it shamelessly, desperate for the friction. â€œTell me to stop, Sunshine.â€
â€œNo.â€ Tell him to stop? A herd of wild horses couldnâ€™t drag me away.
I inched my hand beneath his shirt, eager to explore the expanse of smooth skin and hard muscles beneath my fingers. My entire body pulsated with need, and the possibility of someone walking in on us any moment further heightened my arousal. It was only a kiss, but it seemed so much more illicit. Dangerous.
Alex groaned. His mouth claimed mine again, and the kiss turned fierce. Wanting. Hungry. He was ruthless in his invasion of my senses, his touch so hot and possessive it branded itself into my skin, and I surrendered to him without a shred of resistance.
I was on the verge of unbuckling his belt when he pulled away so forcefully I stumbled forward, disoriented by the sudden loss of contact. My core throbbed, my nipples could cut diamonds, and my skin was so sensitive even the brush of air caused me to tremble. But when the fog of sensation dissipated, I realized Alex was glaring at me.
â€œFuck.â€ He scrubbed a hand over his face, his scowl fierce enough to make grown men quake. â€œFuck, fuck, fuck.
 â€
â€œAlexâ€”â€
â€œNo. What the hell were you thinking?â€ he bit out. â€œDid you think we would fuck in the kitchen while your friends are in the other room?â€
Heat scorched my cheeks. â€œIf this is about Joshâ€”â€
â€œItâ€™s not about Josh.â€ Alex pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled a slow, controlled breath. â€œNot entirely.â€
â€œThen what is it?â€ He wanted me. I knew he did; I felt it, and Iâ€™m not just talking about the massive bulge straining his pants. Yes, Josh would attempt to murder us both if he found out what happened, but he couldnâ€™t stay mad at us forever.
 Besides, he didnâ€™t return to D.C. until Christmas. We had time.
â€œItâ€™s me. And you. Together. It wonâ€™t work.â€ Alexâ€™s glare intensified. â€œWhatever fantasies you have of us swirling in that pretty head of yours, kill them. That kiss was a one-time mistake. Itâ€™ll never happen again.â€
I wanted to die of mortification. I wasnâ€™t sure what wouldâ€™ve been worseâ€”Alex not kissing me back at all, or him kissing me back and saying those things. I wanted to argue, but Iâ€™d used up my boldness quota for tonight. It had taken a helluva lot for me to kiss him first, and a girl can throw herself at a guy only so many times before it becomes humiliating.
â€œFine.â€ I picked up a random dish in the sink and scrubbed, unable to look him in the eyes. My face felt so hot I thought Iâ€™d explode. â€œI get it. Letâ€™s pretend that never happened.â€
â€œGood.â€ Alex didnâ€™t sound as pleased as Iâ€™d expected.
We worked in silence save for the clank of the porcelain.
â€œIâ€™m trying to save you, Ava,â€ he said out of nowhere, right as we finished all the dishes and I prepared to flee.
â€œFrom what?â€ I refused to look at him, but I could see him watching me out of the corner of my eye.
â€œFrom me.â€
I didnâ€™t respond, because how was I supposed to tell the man determined to save me that I didnâ€™t want to be saved?

Alex






I was on a warpath,
 and everyone gave me wide berth as I stalked down the hall toward the elevators. My new assistant, who Iâ€™d hired after firing the congressmanâ€™s insipid daughter for leaking my cell number to the Gruppmann CEO, pretended to be on the phone when I passed, and the rest of the staff kept their eyes glued to their computer screens like their lives depended on it.
I didnâ€™t blame them. Iâ€™d been biting peopleâ€™s heads off left and right for the past week.

Incompetent, every single one of them.

I refused to entertain any other reason Iâ€™d been so cranky since my birthday, especially if that â€œother reasonâ€ happened to be five-five with black hair and lips that tasted sweeter than sin.
I ignored the two people who scrambled off the elevator when they saw me enter, and jabbed the button for the lobby.

That fucking kiss.
 Itâ€™d tattooed itself onto my mind, and I found myself thinking about itâ€”about the way Ava tasted and felt in my armsâ€”far more than I should. Thanks to the â€œgiftâ€ of my memory, I relived those few minutes in Ralphâ€™s kitchen like they were real every night in the shower, my fist wrapped tight around my cock and my chest burning with self-loathing.
I hadnâ€™t seen or heard from Ava since that night. Sheâ€™d skipped our swimming prep sessions this week, and I didnâ€™t even hear from her directly. Jules was the one who texted saying Ava was busy.
Her absence chafed more than I cared to admit.
I got into my car and deliberated. One. Two. Three. Four.
 I tapped my fingers against the steering wheel, torn, before I finally gritted my teeth and set the GPS for the McCann Gallery in Hazelburg.
Nineteen minutes later, I strode into the gallery, my eyes flitting over the pale wood floors, the framed prints hanging on the stark white walls, and the half dozen well-dressed patrons wandering the space before I zeroed in on the brunette behind the counter.
Ava rang up a customer, her face animated and her smile bright as she said something that caused the woman to smile in return. She had a knack for doing that, bringing out the joy in others.
She hadnâ€™t noticed me yet, and for a while, I simply watched her, letting her light creep into the shadowed corners of my soul.
Once the customer left, I walked over, my custom-made loafers silent against the polished floors. It wasnâ€™t until my shadow enveloped her that Ava looked up with a polite, professional smile that wilted the second she saw me.
She swallowed hard, and the sight of that small throat bob sent an unwelcome jolt of desire straight to my dick.
I hadnâ€™t fucked anyone except my right hand in months, and the celibacy was addling my brain.
â€œHi.â€ She sounded wary.
â€œHere.â€ I placed a brand-new phoneâ€”the latest model, which wasnâ€™t available on the market yet and cost me several grandâ€”on the counter.
Her brow knit in confusion.
â€œYour current phone is clearly broken, since I havenâ€™t received so much as a text from you in the past five days,â€ I said icily.
The confusion lingered for a beat before it melted into a teasing expression, and my heart kicked like a damn Rockette at Radio City Hall. I made a mental note to discuss this with my doctor during my annual checkup.
â€œYou miss me,â€ she said.
My hands curled around the edge of the counter. â€œI do not.â€
â€œYou showed up at my work and bought me a new phone because I didnâ€™t text you for a few days.â€ Avaâ€™s eyes gleamed with mischief. â€œI think that amounts to missing me.â€
â€œYou think wrong. I bought you the phone in case you needed a new one for emergencies.
 â€
â€œIn that caseâ€”â€ She pushed the box toward me. â€œI donâ€™t need it. My phone works fine. Iâ€™ve just been busy.â€
â€œDoing what? Attending a silent ashram in the middle of the desert?â€
â€œThatâ€™s for me to know and for you never to find out.â€
A vein throbbed at my temple. â€œDammit, Ava, this isnâ€™t funny.â€
â€œI never said it was.â€ She threw her hands in the air. â€œI donâ€™t know what you want me to say. I kissed you, you kissed me back, then you said it was a mistake, and we agreed never to do it again. I thought you wanted space, and I gave it to you. Iâ€™m not one of those girls who chases after guys who donâ€™t want them.â€ Ava pressed her lips together. â€œI know everythingâ€™s been messed up between us since Saturday. Maybe we need toâ€¦not spend as much time together. I can do the visualizations on my own, and when the time comes, I can find another swim instructorâ€”â€
My blood pressure hit a record high. â€œThe hell you will,â€ I snapped. â€œYou asked me
 to teach you how to swim. Iâ€™m
 the one who worked with you all these weeks. If you think Iâ€™m going to let some fucker swoop in and take whatâ€™s mine, you donâ€™t know me at all.â€ Ava stared at me, her eyes wide with shock. â€œWeâ€™re resuming lessons this weekend. Donâ€™t even think
 of trying to find someone else.â€
â€œFine, no need to yell.â€
â€œIâ€™m not
 yelling.â€ I never raised my voice. Period.
â€œThen why is everyone staring at us?â€ Ava winced. â€œShit, including my manager. Heâ€™s looking right at us.â€ She busied herself with papers behind the counter. â€œI promise only to learn swimming with you, okay? Now leave before I get in trouble.â€
I turned and saw an older male with an unfortunate toupee glowering at us.
â€œDo you get sales commission?â€ I asked Ava without taking my eyes off her manager, who marched toward us, his paunch jiggling over his belt with each step.
â€œYes. Why?â€
â€œIâ€™d like to buy a piece from the gallery.â€ I turned back to Ava when her manager reached us. His name tag read â€œFred.â€ Figured. He was a Fred if I ever saw one. â€œThe most expensive one you have.â€
Her jaw dropped. â€œAlex, the most expensive piece in the gallery isâ€”â€
â€œPerfect for your needs, Iâ€™m sure,â€ Fred cut in. Heâ€™d lost his scowl and now beamed at me like I was the second coming of Jesus. â€œAva, why donâ€™t you ring this gentleman up for the Richard Argus moonlight piece?â€
She looked uneasy. â€œButâ€”â€
â€œNow.â€
My smile cut across my face with the precision of a honed knife. â€œCareful with the tone, Fred. Ava is your best employee. You wouldnâ€™t want to alienate her or any customers who value her opinion very
 highly, would you?â€
He blinked, his eyes darting around as his tiny brain struggled to process the not-so-subtle threat behind my words. â€œN-no, of course not,â€ Fred stuttered. â€œIn fact, Ava, you stay right here with this gentleman. Iâ€™ll pack the piece myself.â€
â€œBut sheâ€™ll get the commission.â€ I arched an eyebrow.
â€œYes.â€ The manager nodded so fast he resembled a bobblehead doll. â€œOf course.â€
While he scurried off to another part of the gallery, Ava leaned in and hissed, â€œAlex, the piece costs $40,000.â€
â€œReally? Shit.â€
â€œIâ€™m sure we canâ€”â€
â€œI thought it was expensive.â€ I allowed myself a soft laugh at her stunned expression. â€œItâ€™s not a big deal. Iâ€™ll own a new piece of art, youâ€™ll receive a hefty commission, and your manager will kiss your ass until the end of days. Win-win.â€
Fred returned with a large black-and-white print.
Fifteen minutes later, the print had been packaged with the same care one would use to handle a newborn baby, and my bank account was forty thousand dollars lighter.
â€œThis weekend, our usual time, Z Hotel,â€ I told Ava after dismissing Fred.
Her eyebrows shot up. We usually practiced at one of our houses or near a lake or Thayerâ€™s pool so she could get more comfortable near water.
â€œIt has the best indoor pool in D.C.,â€ I explained. â€œYouâ€™re ready for actual swimming lessons.â€
Sheâ€™d been ready for a while, but Iâ€™d wanted to make sure before throwing her into the deep end, so to speak.
Ava sucked in a breath. â€œReally?â€
â€œYeah.â€ I flashed a crooked smile. â€œSee you Saturday, Sunshine.â€
I left the gallery in a remarkably better mood than when Iâ€™d entered.

Ava






The day had finally come.

I stood five feet away from the pool, my skin etched with goosebumps even though the temperature hovered at a toasty eighty-four degrees thanks to the hotelâ€™s state-of-the-art heating system.
I wore a one-piece Eres swimsuit, courtesy of Alex, whoâ€™d handed me the shopping bag without a word when he picked me up for our lesson today.
After weeks of learning relaxation techniques and acclimating myself to the thought of being in water, it was time for me to get in
 the water.
I wanted to throw up. Panic gripped me, its icy claws digging into my sweat-slicked skin and drawing invisible blood. My stomach pumped in rhythm with my wild heart, causing my breakfast to slosh around like rubber ducks in a bath.
â€œBreathe.â€ Alexâ€™s calm voice steadied me somewhat. â€œRemember our lessons.â€
â€œOkay.â€ I dragged in a lungful of air and almost gagged at the smell of chlorine. â€œI can do this, I can do this,â€ I chanted.
â€œIâ€™ll go in first.â€ He stepped into the pool until he was waist-deep in the water and held out his hand.
I stared at him, willing my feet to move.
â€œIâ€™ll be right here. I wonâ€™t let anything happen to you.â€ He radiated calm confidence. â€œDo you trust me?â€
I gulped. â€œY-yes.â€
I realized with a start that I did. One hundred percent. Alex may not be the nicest or easiest person to get along with, but I trusted him with my life. Literally.
I edged toward the pool and held my breath as I stepped in and grabbed his hand, letting his strength calm my thundering nerves. The water sloshed around my thighs, and I stumbled.
The hotelâ€™s pool room spun, the pale blue walls and terracotta tiles flashing before me in a blur. Oh God, I canâ€™t do this. I canâ€™tâ€”

â€œClose your eyes. Deep breaths,â€ Alex said. â€œThatâ€™s itâ€¦â€
I did as he instructed, allowing his voice to wash over me until most of the panic subsided.
â€œHow do you feel?â€ he asked.
â€œBetter.â€ I cleared my throat and tried to focus on the small radius around us instead of the entire pool. It was a standard Olympic-size pool, but it might as well be the Atlantic Ocean. â€œIâ€”Iâ€™m ready.â€

As ready as Iâ€™ll ever be.

We started on the shallow end, and Alex had me walk around so I could get used to the feeling of the water and my bodyâ€™s buoyancy. After that, we went deeper until I was submerged up to my shoulders. I clung to the relaxation techniques Iâ€™d learned over the past few months, and they workedâ€”until we reached the part of the lesson where I had to put my head underwater.
I closed my eyes before I dipped my face in, unable to bear the sight of the water rushing toward me.

â€œHelp! Mommy, help me!â€


The words echoed in my head.


So cold. So dark.


I couldnâ€™t breathe.


Something glinted at the edges of my consciousness. A faint memory, perhaps, but it floated away every time I tried to grasp it.


â€œPlease!â€


I sank deeper.


Deeper.


Deeper still.


Pleasepleaseplease.


Icantbreathecantbreathecantbreathe.

â€œAva!â€
I gasped, the sound of my name jerking me back to the present. My screams echoed against the stone walls before fading into oblivion. I wasnâ€™t sure how long Iâ€™d been under. It felt like mere seconds, but judging by how cold I was and how much my throat hurt, it mustâ€™ve been longer.
Alex clutched my arms, his face white. â€œJesus,â€ he breathed, pulling me roughly into his chest while I choked out a sob. We were no longer in the poolâ€”he mustâ€™ve carried me out during my mini blackout. â€œItâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re okay. Weâ€™re out.â€
â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€ I buried my face in his chest, embarrassed and furious with myself. â€œI thought I could do it. I thoughtâ€”â€
â€œYou did great,â€ he said firmly. â€œThis is your first lesson. Thereâ€™ll be more, and youâ€™ll get better each time.â€
â€œPromise?â€
â€œI promise.â€
I shuddered, curling into his warmth. He felt strong and solid beneath my touch, and I was once again struck by the contradiction that was Alex Volkov. So cold and uncaring to the world, yet so warm and protective when he wanted to be. Iâ€™d known him for eight years, yet I hadnâ€™t known him at all.
He wasnâ€™t the man I thought he was. He was so much better, even when he tried to convince me he was worse, and I wanted him like nothing before. Not only physically, but mentally and emotionally. I wanted every shadow of his soul and every piece of his beautiful, multilayered heart. I wanted to pour into him every drop of light I had to give until he consumed me whole. Until I was his, and he was mine.
We stayed thereâ€”me cuddled up against his chest, him with his arms wrapped around meâ€”until my lingering panic faded and I worked up the courage to say what I said next.
â€œAlexâ€¦â€
â€œYes, Sunshine?â€ He ran a gentle hand through my hair.
â€œKiss me.â€
His touch stilled, and he stiffened.
â€œPlease.â€ I licked my lips. â€œForget about Josh orâ€¦whatever else may be on your mind. If you want me, kiss me. I know what we said on your birthday, and Iâ€™m sorry for going back on my word, but I needâ€¦â€ You.
 â€œI need this.â€
Alex closed his eyes, his expression pained. â€œYou have no idea what youâ€™re asking me.â€
â€œYes, I do.â€ I pressed a hand against his abdomen, feeling it tremble beneath my touch. â€œUnless you donâ€™t want to.â€
He left out a half-laugh, half-groan. â€œDoes this feel like I donâ€™t want to?â€ He grasped my hand and pulled it down until it rested on the most masculine part of him. My breath stuttered at his sheer heat and sizeâ€”obvious even under his swim trunksâ€”and I curled my fingers around the thick rod, fascinated by the power I held in my palm.
A low growl rumbled out of Alexâ€™s chest. â€œWhat did I say about staying out of trouble, Sunshine? Keep doing that, and youâ€™ll be in a world
 of trouble.â€
â€œMaybe I like trouble.â€ I tightened my grip, and he hissed out a curse. â€œMaybe I want to stay there.â€
â€œIâ€™m beginning to think youâ€™re
 the trouble I need to stay away from,â€ he muttered. He pinned my wrist to my side, and a jolt of excitement flashed through me. â€œBut we canâ€™t. You justâ€”â€ He gestured toward the pool with his free hand.
â€œI just what? Had a panic attack? I get those all the time when Iâ€™m near water. If that bothers you, weâ€™re in a hotel. We can find a room.â€ It seemed like Iâ€™d recovered all the boldness Iâ€™d lost after kissing Alex on his birthday.
His mouth tilted up. â€œWhen did you get so feisty?â€
â€œWhen I got sick of everyone treating me like Iâ€™m a fragile flower whoâ€™ll break if someone breathes on me the wrong way. Just because I have a phobia over one specific thing doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™ll freak out in other areas of my life.â€ I paused, then added, â€œMadeline told me. About what youâ€”what you like in bed.â€
His expression darkened. The air turned ominous, and my heart gave an anxious thud.
â€œWhat, exactly, did she tell you?â€ His voice lowered to a dangerous decibel.
â€œShe told meâ€”â€ I gulped. â€œShe told me you only do it from behind. That you donâ€™t like kissing or face-to-face contact during sex. That youâ€¦â€
â€œThat I what?â€ Alex asked silkily.
â€œThat you like choking and calling women names. In bed.â€ The danger in the air thickened until I could almost taste it, and my bravado faltered. Maybe baiting the tiger wasnâ€™t the best ideaâ€¦

â€œYet youâ€™re still here, asking me to kiss you.â€ His grip on my wrist turned to iron. â€œWhy is that, Sunshine?â€
He hadnâ€™t denied it, which meant it must be true.
My heart raced.
â€œMaybeâ€”â€ I wet my lips with my tongue, conscious of his eyes tracking the movement the way a lion would a gazelle. â€œI like those things too.â€
Flames burned away the ice pools in his eyes until the heat seared me to my core. I couldnâ€™t believe Iâ€™d ever thought him cold. In that moment, he was a supernova waiting to erupt and swallow me whole.
And Iâ€™d love every second.
Alex released me and stood, no trace of the patient, soothing man from earlier tonight in sight. In its place was something hungry and depraved that caused me to tremble with lust.
â€œGet up,â€ he said, his voice soft but so commanding I obeyed without thinking. â€œYouâ€™re about to find out what happens when you invite yourself into the lionâ€™s den.â€

Alex






It didnâ€™t take long
 for me to secure the penthouse and all but drag Ava into the luxurious suite. I was so fucking hard my cock almost punched a hole through my pants, and the images I had running through my mindâ€¦
Fuck. I was going to destroy her, but any remaining shred of conscience I possessed had disappeared the moment sheâ€™d uttered those words.

Maybe I like those things too.

My blood roared at the memory.

Baby, you have no idea what you got yourself into,
 I thought, shutting the door behind me.
Ava stood in the middle of the bedroom, wearing a dress over her swimsuit and a half-nervous expression. With her doe eyes and innocent features, she resembled a sacrificial virgin awaiting defilement.
My cock throbbed harder.
â€œTake off your clothes,â€ I said, my soft voice a whip crack in the silence.
Part of me wanted to bury myself deep inside her as soon as possible; the other part wanted to savor every moment.
Despite a slight shake in her hands, Ava didnâ€™t hesitate. She kept her eyes trained on mine as she unzipped her dress and the gauzy material pooled around her ankles. The swimsuit went next, sliding down inch by torturous inch until a masterpiece of bare golden flesh unveiled itself.
I devoured her with my eyes, taking in every detail and imprinting it in my mind. Her skin glowed bronze beneath the suiteâ€™s dim lights, and her bodyâ€¦Christ. Round ass, long legs, the sweetest little pussy, and firm, perky titsâ€”not big, but enough for a handful and tipped with hard, rosy nipples that were perfect for sucking and nibbling.
Her chest rose and fell with every breath, and she stared at me with nothing but trust in those big, brown eyes.

Oh, Sunshine. If you only knew.

I circled her, a predator toying with its prey, so close I could smell the tang of her arousal.
I stopped behind her and pressed my body against hers until she could feel my angry, steel-hard erection against the soft curve of her ass. She was naked as the day she was born while I was fully clothed, and somehow that made the scene even filthier.
I pressed my lips to her neck, enjoying the rapid flutter of her pulse beneath my mouth.
â€œYou want me to take you, Sunshine?â€ I murmured. â€œRuin you, pound you into a pathetic mess, turn you into my little fuck doll?â€
A whimper escaped her mouth and shot straight to my groin, hardening my already aching cock. â€œY-yes.â€
â€œYou say yes so easily.â€ I licked the hollow between her neck and lower jaw. True to my nickname for her, she tasted like sunshine and honey, and I wanted to devour her. Feed off her light, consume every inch of her until she was mine and mine alone. â€œBut do you know what it means to be taken by me?â€
Ava shook her head, a quick, small movement that underscored her innocence and naivete.

Not for much longer.
 Once I got my hands on her, sheâ€™d be filthy. Broken. Just like everything I touched. But sheâ€™d be mine. And I was selfish and cruel enough that Iâ€™d take her with me while I burned down the world.
â€œIt means youâ€™re mine. Your mouth is mineâ€¦â€ I rubbed my thumb over her bottom lip before trailing it down her chest and pinching her nipples. She moaned. â€œYour breasts are mineâ€¦â€ I drifted lower, adjusting my position so I could squeeze her ass. Hard. â€œYour ass is mineâ€¦â€ I reached around and parted her thighs, sliding my fingers past her slippery folds. She was so wet they were drenched within seconds. â€œAnd your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch youâ€”â€ My other hand closed around her throat. â€œHeâ€™ll end up in pieces, and youâ€™ll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?â€
Her cunt clenched around my fingers. â€œYes.â€
â€œSay it. Who do you belong to?â€
â€œYou,â€ Ava whispered. â€œI belong to you.â€
â€œThatâ€™s right.â€ I slipped my fingers out of her pussy and thrust them into her mouth. I hummed in approval when she sucked and licked her own juices off without my asking. â€œDo you taste that, Sunshine? Thatâ€™s the taste of you signing your life away. Because from now on, I own you. Body, mind, and soul.â€
Another moan, this one even more eager than the last.
I released my hold on her. â€œGet on your knees.â€ She sank to the floor, so beautiful it made my chest hurt and my cock throb. I fisted her hair and tugged it back until she stared straight up at me. â€œIf it gets to be too much, tap my thigh.â€ When she nodded, I tugged her hair harder and ordered, â€œOpen your mouth.â€
I slipped the head of my cock into her waiting mouth, slowly pushing deeper until I was buried all the way down her throat.
â€œFuck
 .â€ The sensation of her mouth engulfing me was so hot a shudder rippled through my entire body, and I almost shot my load right there. I hadnâ€™t done that since I was a teenager having sex for the first time.
Ava blinked up at me, her eyes watering from my size and how deep I was, but she didnâ€™t tap out, so I stayed still while she adjusted. After what felt like an eternity but was in actuality a few seconds, she started licking and suckingâ€”slowly at first, but quickly building up to a rhythm that had her bobbing her head up and down with enthusiasm.
My other hand shot to the back of her head, and my abs shook from the effort not to come down her throat before I was ready. â€œThatâ€™s it,â€ I growled. â€œSuck that cock like a good little whore.â€
The vibrations from her ensuing moan traveled all the way up my spine. I started thrusting into her, faster and faster until the only sounds were that of my ragged breaths, flesh slapping against flesh, and the gurgles coming from her throat. I was so rough I half-expected her to finally tap out, but she never did.
I pulled out at the last second and came all over her face and chest, the thick white streaks coating her skin in a glistening sheen. My orgasm burned through me, wild and hot, razing any lingering doubts that stood in its way, and I watched my cum drip off Avaâ€™s chin with possessive, lust-filled eyes.
A pale pink flush of arousal stained her face, and her gaze remained locked to mine as her tongue darted out to lick a drop of cum from the corner of her mouth.

Holy fuck.

Iâ€™d witnessed or partaken in just about every filthy sex act imaginable, but that small movement mightâ€™ve been the hottest thing Iâ€™d ever seen.
â€œGet on the bed,â€ I ordered, my voice thick with gravel. â€œAll fours. Now.â€
Her hands and knees barely had time to hit the mattress before I stripped off my clothes and came up behind her, spreading her thighs with my hands.
â€œYou are so very wet, my beautiful whore.â€ I licked her glistening juices off her skin, savoring the taste and delicate female scent that drove every man crazy. I pushed a finger inside her tight, slick folds and was rewarded with a loud whimper. â€œDo you want me to eat out this gorgeous cunt of yours?â€
â€œPlease,â€ Ava gasped, pushing back at me. â€œI needâ€”oh God.â€
 She dropped her head, her squeal muffled by the pillows when I flattened my tongue against her clit, alternating between long, slow licks and fast flicks. I was so fucking hungryâ€”for her, for her taste, for the innocence shattering beneath me at this very moment. I feasted on her like a man possessed, my hand digging into her flesh, my fingers curling inside her until I found the spot that had her bucking against my face. I gently tugged on her clit with my teeth, flicking over the sensitive nub with my tongue, and she exploded, her screams reverberating off the walls.
â€œYou taste so fucking good,â€ I growled, lapping up every drop while she shook and trembled beneath my touch. â€œThe perfect appetizer for tonight.â€
Ava twisted her head to look at me, her face flushed from her orgasm and her eyes round with shock. â€œThat
 was an appetizer? I thoughtâ€”youâ€”â€
â€œSunshine, this is a twelve-course meal.â€ I rolled on a condom and slid my already-hard-again cock along her drenched folds. â€œAnd weâ€™re just getting started.â€
I gripped her throat and slammed into her, and all conversation ground to a halt, unless you counted her moans and my grunts as conversation. She felt like heaven to my hell, the closest Iâ€™d ever get to salvation, and yet I still wanted to drag her into the depths of Hades with me. I fucked her so hard I was afraid Iâ€™d break her, but every time I eased up, Ava uttered tiny warning growls that had my lips curving in a mixture of satisfaction and amusement.
It turned out my sweet, innocent lamb was actually a dirty little slut in disguise, and Iâ€™d never been happier to be wrong.
I flipped her over in time to see her shatter once more, her pleasure-glazed eyes and sighs urging me to go faster and deeper until I, too, came apart in a powerful orgasm that ripped through me with the force of a Category Five hurricane.
When my breathing slowed and I came down from my high, I found Ava staring up at me with a strange expression.
â€œWhat is it, Sunshine?â€ I brushed my lips over hers, already preparing myself for the next round. If I was going to hell for this, I might as well enjoy every second.
â€œNo kissing or face-to-face contact during sex,â€ she murmured. â€œI thought those were your rules.â€
I paused. She was right. Those were
 my rulesâ€”ones I created after I was old enough to realize emotions had nothing to do with sex and feelings had no place in the bedroom. Iâ€™d never once broken themâ€”until tonight. And I hadnâ€™t even thought about it or realized it until Ava reminded me. I enjoyed fucking from the back more than the average manâ€”there was a sense of removal that came with it, which was why it was my position of choiceâ€”but Iâ€™d wanted to see
 her. To watch the way she reacted to each shift in movement, to see her face when she fell apart and screamed my name.
And that was when I realized I was well and truly fucked.
â€œYouâ€™re right, sweetheart,â€ I said, dropping my forehead to hers with a resigned sigh. So. Fucked.
 â€œBut the rules donâ€™t apply to you.â€

Ava






By the time
 Alex and I finished, I was exhausted and wrung out, and I would wake up sore as hell tomorrow, but I didnâ€™t care. Alex hadnâ€™t held back, and that was what Iâ€™d wanted. Needed.
Somehow, in choosing to let go, Iâ€™d never felt more powerful. Strength in weakness, control in submission.
â€œArenâ€™t you tired?â€ I yawned, watching Alex through half-droopy eyes. Weâ€™d gone at it for what mustâ€™ve been hours, but whereas I was ready to pass out, he looked alert and awake as ever.
â€œIf by â€˜tiredâ€™ you mean you wore me out, perhaps,â€ he said in an uncharacteristically teasing tone. â€œBut if youâ€™re asking whether Iâ€™m sleepy, no.â€
â€œHow is that possible?â€ I mumbled into my pillow.
â€œInsomnia, Sunshine. I sleep a few hours a nightâ€”if Iâ€™m lucky.â€
I frowned. â€œBut thatâ€™sâ€¦â€ Another huge yawn. â€œNot good.â€ Humans need sleep. How had Alex survived all this time on only a few hours a night? â€œWe should fix that. Chamomile tea. Meditation. Melatoninâ€¦â€ My voice drifted off. If only my head didnâ€™t feel so heavy and the bed werenâ€™t so comfortable, I could make him tea or find a guided YouTube meditation or something.
â€œLetâ€™s talk about it later. Youâ€™re exhausted.â€ He smoothed a hand over my head, and I purred as I nestled into his touch. â€œGood night.â€
My breaths slowed as sleep took over. I thought I felt an arm wrap around my waist and pull me close, but I was out before I could confirm.
That night, for the first time in a long time, I slept soundly with no nightmares.

Ava






Alex
 and I spent the rest of the weekend locked in our suite, subsisting on room service and orgasms and christening every surfaceâ€”though Iâ€™m not sure â€œchristeningâ€ was the right word to use, considering how filthy our activities were.
Sex with Alex was sex like Iâ€™d never known it. Raw. Animalistic. Soul-destroying in the best possible way. It shattered every preconceived notion of who I was and molded me into something darker, more depraved. He called me Sunshine one moment and his whore the next.
And I loved it.
Even at his coldest, Alex had always treated me with respect outside the bedroom, but inside the bedroom, I was his toy. His to fuck and useâ€”in the shower, pressed against the window, bent over the deskâ€”and I craved it as much as he did.
I screamed, my core clenching around his cock for what mustâ€™ve been the thousandth time as another orgasm ripped through and broke me into a million pieces of ecstatic agony.
When the fog of pleasure finally faded, I found Alex staring down at me with a smirk.
â€œWhat?â€ I murmured, too drowsy with content to utter more words.
â€œI love watching you come apart.â€ His hands gripped my hips possessively. â€œOnly for me, Sunshine. Never forget that.â€
â€œWhat would you do if I did?â€ Iâ€™d meant it as a tease, but Alexâ€™s eyes glittered with danger as his fingers dug into my flesh.
â€œYouâ€™d have a manâ€™s murder on your hands. Is that what you want?â€ He grazed my skin with his nose before he sank his teeth into the side of my neckâ€”punishing and marking me at the same time.
Pain and pleasure burst through me. â€œCareful,â€ I breathed. â€œOr youâ€™ll ruin your reputation for unfeeling sex.â€
â€œNo one else will see me this way. Only you.â€
Before I could rein in the out-of-control butterflies in my stomach, someone knocked on the door. â€œWho is that?â€ I asked, still trying to wrap my head around his words. No one else will see me this way. Only you.

A grin tugged at my mouth.
â€œRoom service. We ordered it before you cornered me and had your way with me.â€ Alex rolled out of bed and laughed softly when I mock glared at him from my pile of wonderful, fluffy pillows.
â€œFor someone with a supposedly â€˜superiorâ€™ memory, you seem to have forgotten that youâ€™re
 the one who woke me up with an urgentâ€¦issue.â€ I arched an eyebrow, remembering the sensation of his hands cupping my breasts and his cock rubbing against my ass this morning.
â€œDid I?â€ He flashed a lazy smile, and I all but melted into a pile of goo. I would never tire of Alexâ€™s smiles. Iâ€™m sorry, honey, but itâ€™s over,
 I told my poor heart. You donâ€™t belong to me anymore.
 â€œHow inconsiderate of me.â€
It wasnâ€™t until he brought back our breakfast that I realized I was starving.

Sex
 , I decided as I nibbled on a croissant, is my favorite form of exercise.

But as incredible as the weekend had been, we had to return to reality tomorrow, and there were things we still needed to discuss.
â€œAlexâ€¦â€
He sighed and set his coffee down. â€œI know.â€
â€œWhat will we tell Josh?â€ I winced, imagining my brotherâ€™s reaction. I should buy full-body armor, just in case.
â€œWeâ€™re both adults. Itâ€™s our decision what we do with our lives.â€ Nevertheless, Alex grimaced. â€œWeâ€™ll tell him in person when he comes home for Christmas.â€
I nodded. Okay, that gave us over a month to prepareâ€”though I wasnâ€™t sure anything would prepare us for the shitstorm Josh would unleash once he found out his baby sister and best friend were sleeping together. Which brought me to my next questionâ€¦
â€œSo, what exactly will we say? I meanâ€”â€ I stabbed at a strawberry, hating myself for bringing this up during such a blissful weekend but also knowing we needed to figure out where we stood before we spiraled into a mess of misunderstandings and uncertainty. â€œAre we friends with benefits? Dating? Exclusive or non-exclusive?â€
Alex gripped my chin and brought my gaze to his. â€œWhat did I tell you? Youâ€™re mine, Sunshine. Youâ€™re never touching another man unless you want him six feet in the ground. So yes, weâ€™re fucking exclusive.â€
Was it bad that his words turned me on so much? Probably, but I didnâ€™t care. â€œSame for you and other women.â€ I scowled, remembering Madeline. â€œNo matter how much they throw themselves at you orâ€¦or look like a supermodel. How many women have you slept with, anyway?â€
His grip loosened, and his dark chuckle set off flutters in my stomach. â€œJealous, Sunshine?â€ he purred. â€œI like this side of you.â€
â€œYou didnâ€™t answer my question.â€
â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter.â€ Alex rolled me over until I was beneath him again. â€œAll that matters is Iâ€™m only sleeping with one woman from now on.â€
â€œSo, is that what we are?â€ I gasped when he slid his rapidly hardening cock along my already-wet slit. â€œFuck buddies?â€
â€œAmong other things.â€ He fished a condom from our dwindling supplyâ€”heâ€™d had to run out yesterday for a boxâ€”and pinned my wrists above my head before thrusting into me. â€œYou want to fuck, we fuck. You want to date, we date. You want to call me your boyfriend, Iâ€™ll call you my girlfriend. But for now, let me take care of that needy little pussy of yours, hmm?â€
And he did.
My shameless moans soaked the air as Alex pounded me into the mattress, his thrusts so rough the bedsprings squeaked and the headboard slammed against the wall.
A tingling sensation blossomed at the base of my spine. I reached up to play with my nipples, my breaths coming out in short pants. I was close. So close
 . I was going toâ€”
The unwelcome ring of an incoming call interrupted our obscene symphony of moans and grunts, followed by a cool voice.
â€œThis is Alex.â€
My eyes flew open. I gaped at Alex, who stared down at me with a calm expression as he listened to whoever was on the other end of the call. Gone was passionate, playful Alex; in its place was the composed businessman Alex.
â€œNo, Iâ€™m free to talk. What happened with the Wilbur development?â€
Free to talk? He was still inside me!

He wasnâ€™t moving, but I could feel every hard inch of him buried in between my thighs.
I opened my mouth to protest, but he shot me a warning look and pressed the fingers of his free hand into my hip, silencing me.
â€œBastard,â€ I mouthed. I knew Alex was ambitious, but Iâ€™d never expected him to take a business call in the middle of freakinâ€™ sex.
What was worse, Iâ€™d been about to come, and I was left squirming with need while he discussed square footage and building plans.
I rolled my hips up, desperate for friction. His eyes flared and his grip tightened before he slid out of me. He muted his end of the call, placed it on speaker, and hauled me off the bed with one arm while he carried his phone in the other.
â€œWhat are you doing?â€ I wrapped my legs around his waist while the man on the other end of the line droned on about zoning laws.
Alex deposited me next to the couch. â€œBend over and spread your legs.â€
Lust speared through me at his authoritative tone. I trembled but obeyed, placing my hands on the armrest, arching my back, and spreading my legs until every inch of me was bared to him.
Satisfaction curled in my stomach when I heard his sharp intake of breath.
The man stopped talking, and Alex unmuted the line to answer his question.
I could see my reflection in the large glass window opposite the couch. Wanton and flushed, my hair tousled from our sex marathon and my breasts hanging heavy and full. Behind me, Alex stood proud as a sculpted god, his face carved with brutal lust as he squeezed my ass.
My soft moan turned into a squeal when he slammed into me hard enough that the couch scraped forward an inch.
â€œDonâ€™t make a sound,â€ he warned. â€œThis is an important call.â€
The flames of desire burned hotter. I should be upset that he was on a business call of all things while fucking me, but I was so turned on I couldnâ€™t see straight. There was something so dirty and delicious about fucking while his partners prattled on, clueless.
Alexâ€™s thrusts picked up a steady, punishing rhythm until I was no longer gripping the armrestâ€”I was on the couch itself, my hips draped over the arm, my face buried in the cushions, my rock-hard nipples and swollen clit scraping against the fabric as he fucked me so viciously my feet lifted off the ground.
All the while, he continued his call, taking it off mute only when he had to speak. When he did, his voice remained calm and even, though I could hear his harsh breathing in the moments when he was silent. I had no clue what they were talking about anymore, too lost in a fog of lust to decipher specific words and phrases.
An unbidden yelp erupted from my throat when he hit a spot that caused my back to bow.
Alex fisted my hair and tugged my head back until I was half-upright again while his other hand closed around my throat. A warning and a reminder rolled into one. Donâ€™t make a sound.

I tried my best. I really did. But I was a messâ€”I could see it in the window, my tear-streaked face and glazed eyes, my mouth hanging slack as orgasm after orgasm crashed over me in an endless, white-hot wave of sensation. Was it possible to die from too much pleasure? If so, that was what was happening. I was dying a million tiny deaths, each one ripping me apart and piecing me back together only for the next to destroy me again.
Another sob of pleasure, one that had Alex releasing my hair so he could cover my mouth and muffle my whines.
One hand over my mouth, one hand around my throat.
I came again, my entire body shuddering with the force of my explosion.
Alex fucked me harder, deeper, the couch screaming with protestâ€”it had slid halfway across the floor by now, its progress impeded only by the wallâ€”and I realized it was otherwise quiet.
The call was over.
â€œI thought you were better at following directions, Sunshine,â€ he said silkily. â€œDidnâ€™t I tell you not to make a sound?â€
I responded with an incoherent mumbleâ€”my failed attempt at apologizing.
â€œNo words?â€ Alex slid his hand down from my throat to my nipples. He pinched them hard, one after the other, eliciting another jumbled moan. â€œDid I fuck your brains out, my gorgeous slut?â€
Considering I couldnâ€™t even remember my name, probably.
And as the minutesâ€”hoursâ€”rolled into each other, I lost myself in him. In us.
In sweet, filthy, depraved oblivion.

My friends had mixed
 reactions to Alexâ€™s and my new relationship status. Jules was ecstatic, claiming she knew
 Alex had a thing for me and demanding to know what he was like in bed. I refused to answer but flushed a deep crimson, and that had told her all she needed to know. I think Jules would have died of disappointment had Alexâ€™s bedroom skills not lived up to the promise of his devastating looks and intimidating presence. Luckily for me, they did.
Stella, meanwhile, was worried. Happy for me, but worried. She warned me to take things slow and not fall too hard, too fast. I didnâ€™t have the heart to tell her that train had left the station ages ago. Maybe not the â€œtoo fastâ€ part, as Alex Volkov had stolen my heart, bit by bit, over the years, even before I thought I liked him, but the â€œtoo hard?â€ Heart, meet freefall
 .
Bridget was neutral. I supposed princesses were inherently more diplomatic, which was why she said nothing other than if I was happy, she was happy.
The specter of Josh lingered in the background, and Iâ€™d acted so jumpy during our last call heâ€™d demanded to know what was wrong. I told him I had period cramps, which shut him up. Periods sucked, but they were a useful weapon for shutting down questions from men.
Today though, I had another family member on my mind.
I waved goodbye to Bridget and Booth, whoâ€™d driven me to my fatherâ€™s houseâ€”an hour and a half from Hazelburgâ€”so I didnâ€™t have to take the train or bus, and unlocked the front door. The house smelled like pine-scented air freshener, and my sneakers squeaked against the polished floors as I searched for my father.
It was his birthday on Tuesday. Since I had class, work, and
 a photoshoot that day, Iâ€™d decided to surprise him today with his favorite cake from Crumble & Bake.
I heard sounds coming from the den, and when I entered the room, I found my dad poring over papers at the table in the corner.
â€œHey, Dad.â€ I slid my bag strap off my shoulder and let the leather tote thump on the ground.
He glanced up, surprise scrawled over his face when he saw me standing there. â€œAva. I didnâ€™t know you were coming home this weekend.â€
Michael Chen was not a conventionally good-looking man, but Iâ€™d always considered him handsome the way all little girls thought their fathers were handsome. Black hair peppered with gray at the temples, broad shoulders, and a dusting of stubble on his chin. He wore a striped polo shirt and jeans, his casual outfit of choice, and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses rested on the bridge of his nose.
â€œIâ€™m not. Well, not the whole weekend.â€ I flashed an awkward smile. â€œI wanted to drop by and wish you a happy early birthday.â€ I placed the cake box on the table. â€œIâ€™m sorry Josh and I canâ€™t be here on your actual birthday, but I brought your favorite cheesecake from C&B.â€
â€œAh. Thank you.â€ He stared at the box but didnâ€™t touch it.
I shifted my weight from foot to foot, restless in the silence.
We had never been good at talking to each other. Luckily, weâ€™d had Josh to fill our conversations with chatter about med school, sports, and his latest adrenaline-inducing adventure. Skydiving, bungee jumping, zipliningâ€”he did it all.
But now Josh was in Central America, and I realized how little my dad and I had to say to each other. When was the last time weâ€™d had a real, one-on-one conversation?
Probably not since he sat my fourteen-year-old self down and explained what happened with my mother.

â€œI donâ€™t understand.â€ My face twisted with confusion. â€œYou told me Mom died of a heart condition.â€


I didnâ€™t remember Mom. I didnâ€™t remember anything before The Blackout other than brief moments that flashed through my mind at unpredictable timesâ€”a snippet of a lullaby sung in a haunting voice, the splash of water followed by screams and laughs, the burn of a scraped knee after I fell off my bike. Glimpses into the past that were too small and fragmented to mean anything.


Of course, there were my nightmares, but I tried not to think about them except in therapy, and only because I had to. Phoebe, my therapist, believed detangling my nightmares was the key to unlocking my repressed memories. I wasnâ€™t a trained psychiatrist like her, but sometimes I wanted to snap back at her maybe Iâ€™d be better off
 not remembering. My brain had repressed the memories for a reason, and no good could come of unleashing those horrorscapes into the present.


Other times, I wanted to dig that key out of my twisted mind with my own hands and unlock the truth, once and for all.


My father braced his hands on his knees and leaned forward with an intensity that unnerved me. â€œThatâ€™s not entirely true,â€ he rumbled in that deep voice of his. â€œWe told you that because we didnâ€™t want to distress you, but Phoebe and I agreed youâ€™re old enough to know the truth now.â€


My pulse thumped in warning. It knew. A storm was rolling in, ready to rain all over my life as I knew it. â€œWh-whatâ€™s the truth?â€


â€œYour mother died of an overdose. Sheâ€¦took too many pills one day, and her heart stopped.â€


Funny. That was what my heart did too. Just for a beat or two, not enough to kill me. Not like itâ€™d killed my mom.


Because â€œheart stoppedâ€ was just a euphemism for â€œdied,â€ and â€œtook too many pillsâ€ was just a euphemism for â€œcommitted suicide.â€


My lower lip trembled. I dug my nails into my thigh until crescent grooves etched into my flesh. â€œWhy would she do that?â€


Why would she leave me and Josh? Didnâ€™t she love us? Werenâ€™t we enough?


Parents were supposed to be there for their children, but she took the easy way out and
 left.

I knew that was unfair, because I had no idea what sheâ€™d been going through, but that only angered me more. Not only did I not have my mother, but I also didnâ€™t even have memories of her. That wasnâ€™t her fault, but I blamed her anyway.


If she were here, we couldâ€™ve made new memories, and the absence of the old ones wouldnâ€™t matter as much.


My father rubbed a hand over his face. â€œShe didnâ€™t leave a letter.â€
 Of course she didnâ€™t, I thought bitterly. â€œBut I imagine she feltâ€¦guilty.â€


â€œAbout what?â€


He flinched.


â€œAbout what, Dad?â€ My voice rose. My pulse was roaring now, so loud I almost didnâ€™t hear his answer.


Almost.


But I did, and when I registered his words, tasted the poison of their truth, my chest collapsed on itself.


â€œAbout what happened at the lake when you were five. How you almost drowned. How she pushed you in.â€

I gulped in a deep breath, my lungs greedy for the oxygen.
My dad shattered my world that day in my bedroom. That was why Iâ€™d been so happy when I left for college. I hated the memory of that conversation and the way his words had soaked into the walls. They whispered to me every time I walked down the halls, taunting me, twisting my past into new truths.

Your own mother didnâ€™t love you. Your own mother tried to kill you.

I blinked back sudden tears and pasted a smile on my face. The smiles had gotten me through tough times. Iâ€™d read online that the physical act of smilingâ€”even if you were unhappyâ€”could improve your mood by tricking your brain into releasing happiness-inducing hormones. So Iâ€™d smiled all the time as a teenager, and people probably thought I was crazy, but it was better than sinking into a darkness so deep I mightâ€™ve never clawed my way out.
And when smiling on my own became too hard, I looked for other reasons to be â€œhappyâ€ like the beauty of a rainbow after a storm, the sweet taste of a perfectly baked cookie, or gorgeous photographs of glittering cities and epic landscapes around the world. It had workedâ€¦for the most part.
â€œâ€¦of the cake?â€
My fatherâ€™s voice shook me out of my trip down memory lane.
I blinked. â€œIâ€™m sorry, what?â€
He hitched an eyebrow. â€œDo you want a piece of the cake?â€ he repeated.
â€œOh, uh, sure.â€
He picked up the cake box, and we walked silently to the kitchen, where he silently cut us slices and we silently chewed.

Awkward with a capital A.

I wondered where it had gone wrong with us. My father never had issues talking and laughing with Josh. Why did he act so weird around me? And why did I act so weird around him? He was my dad,
 yet Iâ€™d never been able to open up to him fully.
He paid my bills and fed and sheltered me until I went to college, but Josh had been my real sounding board over the years, the one I went to whenever I wanted to talk about my day or had problemsâ€”with school, friends, or much to his disgust, boys.
It was more than the fact that my dad was an authority figure and Josh was closer to my age. I had no trouble connecting with professors and my friendsâ€™ parents.
It was something else. Something I couldnâ€™t name.
But perhaps thatâ€™s just the nature of Asian parents of a certain age. Itâ€™s not in our culture to show affection openly. We didnâ€™t say I love you
 or hug all the time like Stellaâ€™s family. Chinese parents show their love through actions, not wordsâ€”working hard to provide for their children, cooking food, taking care of their kids when theyâ€™re sick.
I grew up not wanting for any material goods, and my father paid my full tuition at Thayer, which wasnâ€™t cheap. Sure, he disapproved of my photography career, and I had to fund all my equipment myself. And yeah, he played favorites with Josh, probably because he retained a deep-seated cultural preference for sons over daughters. But in the grand scheme of things, Iâ€™d lucked out. I should be grateful.
Still, it would be great if I could hold a normal conversation with my own father without it devolving into awkward silence.
I stabbed at my cake, wondering whether any early birthday surprise had ever been as pathetic as this one, when my skin tingled.
I looked up, and the tingles morphed into chills.

There.

Maybe that was why Iâ€™d never opened up to my dad, because sometimes I caught him staring at me like that.
Like he didnâ€™t know me.
Like he hated me.
Like he feared me.

â€œItâ€™s not safe.â€

Bridget drew herself up to her full five feet, nine inches and leveled an icy glare at the dark-haired man glowering right back at her. Ballsy, considering she was the princess and he was the bodyguard, but Rhys Larsen wasnâ€™t Booth. That much was clear in the week since heâ€™d arrived in Hazelburg to take over Boothâ€™s protection duties.
Weâ€™d thrown a big going away celebration for Booth at The Crypt and sent quick prayers that Bridgetâ€™s new bodyguard would be as cool as Booth.
Prayers not answered.
Rhys was gruff, surly, and arrogant. He drove Bridget mad, which was quite something, since she never lost her temper. In the past seven days, however, Iâ€™d seen her on the verge of yelling
 . Iâ€™d been so shocked I almost dropped my camera.
â€œFall Fest is an annual tradition,â€ she said in a regal voice. â€œIâ€™ve attended every year for the past three years, and I donâ€™t intend to stop now.â€
Rhysâ€™s gray eyes flickered. He was a little younger than Boothâ€”maybe early thirties, with thick black hair, eyes the color of gunmetal, and a broad, muscled frame that towered over Bridgetâ€™s leggy grace, even when she wore heels. Dark stubble shadowed his chin, and a small, jagged scar slashed across his left eyebrow. Without the scar, he wouldâ€™ve been disconcertingly gorgeous; with it, he was still disconcertingly gorgeous, but also dangerous. More menacing.
Good quality to have in a bodyguard, I supposed.
â€œItâ€™s a crowd management issue.â€ His voice rumbled through the car, deep and authoritative, even though he was technically Bridgetâ€™s employee. â€œToo many people, too close quarters.â€
Stella, Jules, and I wisely stayed quiet while Bridget matched him glare for glare. â€œItâ€™s a college event. Thereâ€™s bound to be a crowd, and Iâ€™ve never had issues before. Half the people there donâ€™t even know who I am.â€
â€œIt only takes one person one time,â€ Rhys countered, his tone even. â€œOne look and I know the festival is over max capacity.â€
â€œThis is ridiculous. Iâ€™m not entering a war zone, and there are fewer people than at a sports game. No one ever said I couldnâ€™t attend one of those.
 â€
â€œThe security measures and layout at sports games areâ€”â€
â€œEnough.â€ Bridget held up a hand. â€œI refuse to stay in my house like a princess locked in a tower my senior year of college. Iâ€™m going, and you can either stay in the car or come with me.â€ She opened the car door and exited without a backward glance.
Rhysâ€™s nostrils flared, but he followed her a heartbeat later, those sharp eyes of his constantly roving, searching for danger.
Jules, Stella, and I scrambled after them.
Fall Fest was one of the most anticipated events of the school year. Local businesses set up booths hawking seasonal food and products discounted for studentsâ€”decadent hot chocolate and apple cider donuts, pumpkin pies and pulled-pork sandwiches. There were classic games and activities like bobbing for apples, tarot readings, andâ€”because this was collegeâ€”a tailgate where local alumni and students gathered to drink to their heartâ€™s content.
Rhys was rightâ€”there were more people than expected at the festival, but it was nothing compared to the spring break parties weâ€™d attended in the past. I understood why he was concerned, but I also agreed with Bridget he was overreacting a tiny
 bit.
Bridget ignored him as we took advantage of all the food and activities on offer. Fall Fest was a necessary stress reliever between midterms and finals, and we had a blastâ€”for the most part.
â€œHeâ€™s driving me crazy,â€ Bridget said a while later in a low voice. She sipped her hot chocolate with a morose expression. â€œI miss Booth.â€
I glanced over my shoulder at Rhys, who followed us with an impassive expression. Either he didnâ€™t hear what she said, or he had the worldâ€™s best poker face.
I bet the latter. I had a feeling there wasnâ€™t much, if anything, that Rhys Larsen didnâ€™t see, hear, or notice.
â€œItâ€™s his first week.â€ Stella snapped a picture of her drink before tasting it. â€œBooth has been with you for years. Itâ€™s only natural that Rhys would be more overprotective. Give him time.â€
â€œI suppose.â€ Bridget sighed. â€œI donâ€™t know how Nik does it. He has double the security I do because heâ€™s the crown prince, and thereâ€™s so much riding on his shoulders.â€ She shook her head. â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™m second in line to the throne.â€
â€œYou mean you donâ€™t want to rule, Your Majesty?â€ I teased. â€œYou could be a queen and see your face on a postage stamp.â€
Bridget laughed. â€œNo, thank you. As tempting as a postage stamp with my face is, Iâ€™d rather have a modicum of freedom.â€ She shot a dark look in Rhysâ€™s direction. â€œUnless my bodyguard has other ideas.â€
â€œHeâ€™s strict, but at least heâ€™s delicious,â€ Jules said in a stage whisper. â€œNo offense to Booth, but whew.
 â€ She fanned herself.
â€œIs that all you think about?â€ Bridget asked, clearly torn between laughter and frustration.
A shadow slid across Julesâ€™s face before it disappeared. â€œMost of the time. I like to think about pleasant things. Speaking of whichâ€¦â€ She turned to me. â€œWhereâ€™s Lover Boy?â€
I rolled my eyes, a blush spreading over my cheeks. â€œDonâ€™t call him that, and heâ€™s busy running a company. He doesnâ€™t have time for college events.â€
â€œYou sure about that?â€ Stella tilted her chin at something behind me.
I whipped around, my heart jumping in my throat when I saw Alex standing behind me. In his navy cashmere sweater and jeans, he cut a sophisticated figure amongst the crowds of drunk college students and rumpled professors.
I couldnâ€™t help itâ€”I ran and threw my arms around him. â€œI thought you had work!â€
â€œI took off early.â€ He pressed a kiss to my lips, and I sighed with pleasure. â€œI miss Fall Fest.â€
â€œUh-huh. Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s
 what you miss,â€ Jules teased.
My friends stared at us with fascination, and I realized this was the first time theyâ€™d seen us together as aâ€¦couple? I wasnâ€™t sure what to call our relationship. â€œCoupleâ€ sounded too mundane, but I guessed that was what we were.
We went on dates, talked through the night, and had wild, explosive sex. Alex Volkov and I were a couple.
The butterflies in my stomach quivered with excitement.
Alex stayed with us through the end of Fall Fest. He declined to play most of the festival games, but we convinced him to take pictures at the pumpkin-themed photo booth.
â€œDo you realize these are the first photos we have of the two of us?â€ I waved the Polaroids in triumph. â€œIf you donâ€™t hang them in your living room, Iâ€™ll be offended.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know. You donâ€™t match my decor,â€ he said in a bland tone.
I swatted him on the arm, earning myself a rare laugh. Stella nearly choked on her hot cocoa, she was so shocked.
It was the perfect afternoon: great food, great weather, great company. The only hiccup occurred when Alex nicked himself on something sharp at one of the booths. The cut was deep enough that blood welled and streaked down his finger.
â€œItâ€™s fine,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s just a scratch.â€
â€œYouâ€™re bleeding.â€ I planted my hands on my hips. â€œWe have to clean and bandage it. Letâ€™s go.â€ My tone brooked no opposition.
No way in hell was he walking around with blood dripping down his hand. What if it got infected?
Alexâ€™s mouth quirked up. â€œYes, maâ€™am.â€
I huffed at his amusementâ€”he was bleeding
 â€”and dragged him to the campus health center, where the bored-looking student assistant supplied us with a gauze pad and Band-Aid.
I rinsed the cut under running tap water in the bathroom and dabbed at it with the gauze. â€œHold still.â€ I tossed the gauze in the trash and peeled open the Band-Aid. â€œYou shouldâ€™ve been more careful,â€ I grumbled. â€œYouâ€™re lucky you werenâ€™t seriously hurt. What the hell were you thinking?â€
I looked up and found Alex staring at me with a small smile.
â€œWhat?â€
â€œYouâ€™re cute when youâ€™re worried.â€
I pressed my lips together, struggling to contain my smile. â€œDonâ€™t try to act all sweet so you can get out of trouble.â€
â€œAm I in trouble?â€ he drawled. He kicked the door shut with his foot and locked it with his free hand.
My pulse ratcheted up a notch. â€œYes.â€
â€œYou think Iâ€™m acting sweet?â€
I gave a tiny nod.
Alex hefted me up onto the sink. â€œWe better remedy both those things, shouldnâ€™t we?â€
My teeth dug into my bottom lip as he shoved my dress up over my chest and grazed his teeth over my nipples through the thin lace of my bra.
â€œAlex, weâ€™re in the student health center,â€ I squeaked, wanting him to both stop and keep going. Everyone was at Fall Fest so the center wasnâ€™t busy, but the receptionist sat a few feet away outside the door and the flimsy walls were anything but
 soundproof.
â€œIâ€™m aware.â€ He pulled my bra aside with his teeth and lavished attention on my breasts while his non-bandaged hand found the sweet spot between my legs. I was already soaked for him, my thighs slick with my juices as he drove me crazy with his mouth and fingers. His erection pressed against my leg, thick and hard as a steel pipe, but when I reached for it, he batted my hand away.
â€œI hope youâ€™re not attached to your underwear,â€ he said.
My brows drew together. â€œWhaâ€”â€ The sound of fabric tearing answered my incomplete question.
Alexâ€™s mouth curled into a sly grin at my shocked expression. â€œSince weâ€™ve established that youâ€™re a screamer,â€ he said. â€œOpen your mouth.â€
My resistance collapsed.
I opened my mouth, and he shoved my underwear in, muffling my moan. I shivered when I tasted the slickness of my arousal.
I was throbbing now, so turned on I couldnâ€™t see straight. There was something so freakinâ€™ erotic about knowing someone could catch us any minute.
Alex returned his attention to my breasts while he slid one finger, then two, into my slippery folds. I gripped his hair, tugging so hard it mustâ€™ve hurt as he worked me into a frenzy, but if it did, he didnâ€™t show it.
He lifted his head from my chest and watched me with smoldering eyes. â€œThatâ€™s it, Sunshine,â€ he murmured, his muscles taut as he finger fucked me harder. He was knuckles deep inside me now, the obscene sounds of him sliding in and out of my drenched core creating a dirty symphony that intensified my arousal. I rode his hand shamelessly, drool leaking from the corners of my mouth as I screamed around my makeshift gag. â€œCome for me like a little slut.â€
I did. Hard, fast, and endlessly, flying high in an explosion of starry bliss.
When I finally came down, I saw that he had unbuttoned his pants and was fisting his cock. It didnâ€™t take long before he erupted, spurting thick, hot jets all over my thighs.
â€œNo,â€ he said when I reached to clean myself. He pulled my shredded panties out of my mouth and pocketed them, his movements crisp and precise. â€œI want you to walk around with my cum on you so you know exactly who you belong to.â€
Heat blistered my cheeks. â€œAlex,â€ I hissed. â€œI canâ€™t walk out there with no underwear andâ€¦andâ€”â€
â€œYou can, and you will.â€ His fingers brushed my thighs, where the cum was already drying. â€œThe faster you obey, the faster we can leave and go home, where you can shower. With help,â€ he added with a wicked smile.
â€œYouâ€™re crazy.â€ But I did as he asked, pulling my sweater dress down and fixing my hair. I couldnâ€™t look the receptionist in the eye as we walked out. She probably knew what weâ€™d done, because it didnâ€™t take that
 long to bandage a wound.
The wind brushed against my bareness as we rejoined our friends and I jumped, earning myself a smirk from Alex and strange looks from everyone else.
â€œAre you okay?â€ Stella asked. â€œYou look flushed.â€
â€œYes,â€ I squeaked. â€œJust, ah, a bit chilly.â€ While the others got distracted by the start of the pie-eating contest, I slapped Alexâ€™s arm. â€œYouâ€™ll pay for this.â€
â€œLooking forward to it.â€
I rolled my eyes, but I couldnâ€™t stay mad at him, especially since part of me loved how dirty I felt walking around like this.
â€œI have a serious question,â€ I said as we watched two seniors destroy their pumpkin pies. â€œWhat are you doing for Thanksgiving?â€
â€œI imagine Iâ€™ll be eating turkey somewhere,â€ he said casually.
â€œDo youâ€¦want to come to my place for the weekend? Since your uncle doesnâ€™t celebrate and all. Not that you have to,â€ I added quickly.
â€œSunshine, Iâ€™ve spent every Thanksgiving with your family for the past eight years.â€
â€œI know, but Josh isnâ€™t here this year, and I didnâ€™t want to assume. I mean, meeting the dadâ€¦â€
Alexâ€™s eyes gleamed with laughter. â€œIâ€™ve already met your dad.â€
â€œRight. Butâ€¦â€ I faltered. â€œI guess it doesnâ€™t matter. We canâ€™t tell him weâ€™re dating until we tell Josh, but would it be suspicious if we show up together? Parents have a weird lie-detecting radar. What if heâ€”â€
â€œAva.â€ He placed his hands on my shoulders. â€œDo you want me to spend Thanksgiving with you?â€
I nodded.
â€œThen thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing. Donâ€™t overthink it.â€
â€œSays the King of Overthinking,â€ I muttered, but I was smiling.

Ava






Every year,
 my family celebrated Thanksgiving with a Chinese twist. Instead of turkey and mashed potatoes, we ate roast duck, rice, dumplings, and fish cake soup. Food-wise, this year was the same, but without Josh, the dinner had been two hours of silence and awkwardness. Alex and my dad held a few brief conversations about football and work, and that was it. I think my dad was stressed about something at his office. He seemed more irritated than usual.
I also suspected my dad didnâ€™t like Alex much. It was a surprise, considering he had a soft spot for smart, accomplished people, and Alex was as smart and accomplished as they came. Iâ€™d always chalked it up to the fact that Alex didnâ€™t kiss ass as much as Chinese parents likedâ€”he wasnâ€™t one for flattering words. Plus, I was ninety percent sure my dad knew something was up with me and Alex, though he didnâ€™t say anything.
â€œHe knows,â€ I whispered when my dad excused himself to use the restroom. â€œI swear, he knows
 .â€
â€œNo, he doesnâ€™t. Even if he does, he has no proof, and he wonâ€™t say anything to Josh,â€ Alex said. â€œRelax. Itâ€™s supposed to be your weekend off.â€
â€œThereâ€™s no such thing as a weekend off for students.â€
It may have been a holiday, but I had to study for finals and finish my fellowship application. It was all done except for a few paragraphs of my personal statement. Iâ€™d included the photos I took of Alex in my portfolio, though I havenâ€™t told him yet. They were some of my best work, but I didnâ€™t want to say anything until I heard from the WYP committee. I didnâ€™t want to jinx it.
â€œItâ€™s too bad weâ€™re not sleeping in the same room.â€ Alexâ€™s eyes glinted. â€œI could help relieve your stress.â€
I laughed. â€œIs that all you think about?â€
Except I wasnâ€™t much better. I wanted to sleep in the same room as Alex tooâ€”especially here, in this house, where the nightmares were always darker. But since my dad didnâ€™t know about our relationship, Alex was staying in the guest room.
â€œOnly when Iâ€™m around you.â€ While my dad seemed more stressed, Alex was more relaxed these days. Smiling, laughingâ€¦he even made the occasional joke. I liked to think I had a part in loosening him up. I was still taking Krav Maga lessons with Ralph, and Alex was still giving me swim lessonsâ€”I panicked way less now than I did at the beginningâ€”and after everything heâ€™d helped me with, I wanted to help him too. He came off invincible and unflappable, but everybody, no matter how strong, needs a little care and attention of their own.
â€œAlex Volkov, when did you become so cheesy?â€ I teased.
He left out a playful growl and reached for me right as my father reentered the dining room. We sobered and maintained a safe distance between us the rest of the night, but my dadâ€™s raised eyebrows confirmed my suspicions. He knew.



* * *



I couldnâ€™t breathe.
 The hand tightened around my neck, and I thrashed my arms and legs, desperate to throw it off.


â€œStop,â€ I tried to say. â€œPlease stop.â€


But I couldnâ€™t. The hand was too tight.


Tears blurred my vision. Snot ran down my nose.


I was dying. Dyingâ€¦dyingâ€¦

I awoke with a gasp. My sweat-drenched sheets slid off my body, and I looked around wildly, certain Iâ€™d find an intruder in my room. Deep shadows skulked in the corners, and the eerie, pale blue hues of twilight filtered through the white lace curtains fluttering in the window.
But there was no intruder.
â€œIt was a dream,â€ I whispered, my voice a gunshot in the silence. â€œIt was just a dream.â€
A different one from the ones I usually had. I wasnâ€™t underwater. I didnâ€™t scream. But I was terrifiedâ€”more terrified than I had been in a long, long time.
Because my dreams were never just dreamsâ€”they were memories.
I always had worse â€œdreamsâ€ at home. Maybe it was because of the lake out back. It was a different lake than the one at my motherâ€™s house before she died, but it was a lake, nonetheless.
I wished my family didnâ€™t like lakes so much.
I glanced at my digital clock, and the icy fingers of dread scratched down my spine when I saw the time. 4:44 a.m. Again.
I wanted to run down the hall and throw myself into Alexâ€™s arms. With him, I was safe. Even my nightmares had decreased in frequency and intensity since weâ€™d started sleeping together every nightâ€”me tucked into his side, his arms wrapped around me in a protective embrace. While I wanted his insomnia cured, wanted him to get the peace and rest he deserved every night, a tiny, shameful part of me liked that he was awake to watch over me in the long hours between dusk and dawn.
He was probably awake, but I forced myself to stay put in case he wasnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t want to risk interrupting the two or three precious hours of sleep he got every night.
I crawled back beneath my covers and tried to catch more shuteye, but my skin itched, and something called to me beyond the walls. I resisted for as long as I could, until twilight melted into dawn.

7:02 a.m.
 A more respectable time to wake up than 4:44 a.m.
I changed into a sweatshirt and yoga pants, shoved my feet into fuzzy boots, and tip-toed through the silent house toward the backyard. The air smelled fresh and crisp, and a light fog hung over the lake, cloaking the scene in mystery.
The itching on my skin intensified. The call grew louder.
I walked toward the lake, my boots crunching over the tiny gravel stones of the barbecue area my dad had set up for summer get-togethers. Drops of dew dusted the empty wood furniture, and the charcoal grill looked sad and lonely, rendered useless until Memorial Day weekend.
My breaths formed tiny puffs in the air. It was colder than Iâ€™d expected, but I didnâ€™t stop walking until I reached the edge of the lakeâ€”close enough to smell the damp earth beneath my feet.
It was the first time I remembered visiting the lake.
Iâ€™d shied away from it growing up, going only as far as the barbecue seating area. Even then, Iâ€™d get so nervous I would excuse myself halfway through parties and run to the bathroom to bring myself under control.
I wasnâ€™t sure what compelled me to come out here this morning, but the lakeâ€™s siren song enveloped me, coaxing me closerâ€”like it was trying to tell me a secret it didnâ€™t want others to hear.
I was better with water now after all my lessons with Alex, but a tremor of unease still spiraled through me when I thought about the watery depths before me.

Deep breaths. Youâ€™re fine. Youâ€™re on solid ground. The lake will not rise up and drag youâ€”

A car alarm blared in the distance, and I flinched, all relaxation techniques forgotten as my nightmare played out in broad daylight.

I picked up another stone from the ground. It was smooth and flat, the type that would make
 really pretty ripples. I drew my arm back to throw it, but I smelled something sweet and floweryâ€”Mommyâ€™s perfumeâ€”and got distracted.


My aim veered, and the stone thudded onto the ground, but I didnâ€™t mind. Mommy was back! We could play now.


I turned, smiling a big gap-toothed smile, but I only made it halfway before something pushed me. I pitched forwardâ€”down, down, off the edge of the deck, my scream swallowed up by the water rushing toward my face.

â€œAva?â€ My fatherâ€™s worried voice penetrated my daze. â€œWhat are you doing out here?â€
I forgot. He came out here every morning to exercise, rain or shine. He was religious about his morning routine.
I spun, trying to escape the images flashing through my brain, but they wouldnâ€™t stop. Old nightmares. New revelations.

No. No, no, nononononono.

My fatherâ€™s gold signet ring flashed in the light, and I saw his face.
And I screamed.

Alex






Something was wrong.

I felt it deep in my bones as I pulled into my driveway, my sixth sense blaring.
Ava stared straight ahead, her face pale, her eyes unseeing. Sheâ€™d been like this since the morning after Thanksgiving, when her father found her by the lake and sheâ€™d screamed so loud she woke me up from one of my rare bouts of sleep. Iâ€™d raced outside, my mind conjuring all sorts of horrible scenarios while I cursed myself for leaving her alone. For failing her.
But I found her outside, safe and unharmedâ€”at least physicallyâ€”while her father tried to soothe her. Lines of distress had marred Michaelâ€™s face as she shook like a leaf in the wind, tears streaming down her face. She refused to tell us what was wrong, and it wasnâ€™t until hours later that she confessed sheâ€™d freaked out about being that close to the lake. She wasnâ€™t sure why sheâ€™d gone out there in the first place, but her aquaphobia had kicked in late.

Bullshit.

Ava could enter the pool now without panicking, and sheâ€™d stayed calm when we visited lakes before. No, something else had terrified her to the point where sheâ€™d screamed the house down, and once I found out what it was, I would hunt it to the ends of the earth and tear it apart with my bare hands.
I guided her into my house, where I tucked her beneath a blanket on the couch and made her a hot drink. Iâ€™d turned off the heat since Iâ€™d gone away for the weekend, and until it caught up, the house was freezing.
â€œHot chocolate with oat milk and three marshmallows.â€ I kept my tone light as I handed Ava the drink. â€œJust like you like it.â€
â€œThanks.â€ She wrapped her hands around the mug and stared at the marshmallows bobbing in the liquid but made no move to drink it.
Normally, sheâ€™d have downed half the mug by now. She loved hot chocolate. It was her favorite part of winter.
I grasped her chin and angled her face toward mine. â€œTell me who or what I need to kill,â€ I growled. â€œWhat happened at your fatherâ€™s house?â€
â€œI told you, nothing. It was just the lake.â€ Ava eked out a wobbly smile. â€œYou canâ€™t kill a lake.â€
â€œIâ€™ll drain every fucking lake and ocean in the world if I have to.â€
A tiny crystal tear slipped from her eye. â€œAlexâ€¦â€
â€œI mean it.â€ I rubbed the tear away with my thumb. My heart raged in my chest, a snarling beast furious at the sight of her distress and the thought there was something in the world that would dare hurt her. Hypocrite,
 my conscience whispered. Cruel, selfish hypocrite
 . Look in the mirror. Think about the things youâ€™ve done.
 I gritted my teeth and ignored the taunting voice in my head. â€œIâ€™d do it for you.â€ I kissed the spot where her tear had been. â€œIâ€™d do anything for you. No matter how twisted or impossible.â€
A shudder rolled through her body. â€œI know. I trust you. More than anyone else in this world.â€

If only she knew,
 my conscience sang. If only she knew what kind of man you are. She wouldnâ€™t touch you with a ten-foot pole, much less trust you.


Shut. Up.

Great. I was now having silent conversations with an imaginary voice.

How the mighty have fallen.

â€œI donâ€™t know if itâ€™s evenâ€¦if itâ€™s true,â€ Ava whispered. â€œI could have imagined it.â€
My knuckles turned white around my knee. â€œImagined what?â€
â€œIâ€”â€ She gulped, her eyes haunted. â€œMy childhood memories. They came back.â€
The confession hit me like a freight train, blindsiding me.
Of all the things Iâ€™d expected her to say, that had not been one of them.
Repressed memories were usually the result of a traumatic event and could resurface if the person encountered a triggerâ€”a sound, a smell, an event. But Ava had been at home, where sheâ€™d grown up her entire life. What had happened over Thanksgiving that couldâ€™ve triggered her? The lake?
â€œOkay.â€ I kept my voice calm and even. Soothing. â€œWhat do you remember?â€
Avaâ€™s shoulders trembled. â€œI donâ€™t remember everything. But I remember the day Iâ€¦the day I almost died.â€
My entire body flushed hot, then cold. Almost died.
 If she had died, if she was no longer somewhere in this worldâ€¦
The invisible noose around my neck tightened; a tiny bead of sweat trickled down the back of my neck.
Her near-death experience wasnâ€™t my fault. Itâ€™d happened long before I met her, but stillâ€¦
My breath grew shallow.
â€œI was playing by the lake.â€ She licked her lips. â€œThere used to be a dock that ran out to the middle of the water. My dad took it down after The Incidentâ€”thatâ€™s what I call what happenedâ€”but we used to go out there all the time until my parentsâ€™ divorce. My dad moved out, and my mom fell into a depression. It was a really nasty divorce, from what I gleaned over the years, and now I remember all the shouting and threats. I was too young to understand what they were mad about; all I knew was that they were angry. So angry sometimes I thought they would kill each other. Anyway, my mom stopped taking me out to the lake until one dayâ€¦she did. We were playing on the dock, and we ran out of sunscreen. My mom was really big on sunscreenâ€”said it was the most important thing we could do for our skin. I didnâ€™t want to stop playing to go with her, so she made me promise to stay put while she ran inside. She was supposed to be gone for only a few minutes.â€
Ava traced the rim of the mug with her finger, her eyes gaining that far-off quality that told me she was lost in her unearthed memories. â€œI did. I stayed put. Watched the fish, threw stones in the waterâ€”I loved the ripples they made. I waited for her to come back so we could play again. Iâ€™ve had nightmares about this day for as long as I could remember, so not all of this is new. I remembered her leaving, and I remembered her returning and me falling into the water. Onlyâ€¦â€ She drew in a deep breath. â€œI donâ€™t think she returned. I thought I smelled her perfume, but in my nightmaresâ€”my memoriesâ€”I never got a good look at the face of the person who pushed me. It all happened so quickly. But when I was by the lake a few days agoâ€¦more memories returned, and I realized Iâ€™d seen more than Iâ€™d thought. Before I fell in the water, I saw a flash of gold. A signet ring. MC.â€

Dread and shock coiled at the base of my spine and flared their wings, enveloping me in their dark embrace.
â€œMichael Chen.â€ Ava shook harder. â€œAlex, my mom didnâ€™t try to kill me. My dad did.â€

Ava






I couldnâ€™t stop throwing
 up.
I heaved into the toilet, my stomach roiling, my skin drenched with sweat as Alex held my hair back and rubbed circles on my back.
He was livid. Not at me, but at my father, my past, the entire situation. I could feel it in the tenseness of his hands and the aura of barely leashed violence thatâ€™d swirled around him since I confessed my memories.
The day at the lake had only been the tip of the iceberg.
Iâ€™d remembered something elseâ€”something that cemented my fatherâ€™s guilt.

â€œDaddy, look!â€ I ran into his office, brandishing the paper in my hands with pride. It was an essay I wrote for class on who we admired most. I wrote about Daddy. Mrs. James gave me an A plus on it, and I couldnâ€™t wait to show him.


â€œWhat is it, Ava?â€ He raised his eyebrows.


â€œI got an A plus! Look!â€


He took the paper from me and skimmed it, but he didnâ€™t look happy like Iâ€™d expected.


My smile dimmed. Why was he frowning? Werenâ€™t Aâ€™s good? He always praised Josh when he brought home Aâ€™s.


â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€


â€œItâ€™s a paper about who I admire most?â€ I twisted my hands, growing more nervous. I wished Josh was here, but he was at his friendâ€™s house. â€œI said you, because you saved me.â€


I didnâ€™t remember him saving me, but that was what everyone told me. They said I fell into a lake a few years ago and wouldâ€™ve died if Daddy hadnâ€™t jumped in after me.


â€œI did, didnâ€™t I?â€ He finally smiled, but it wasnâ€™t a nice smile.


I suddenly didnâ€™t want to be here anymore.


â€œYou look so much like your mother,â€ Daddy said. â€œA carbon copy of when she was your age.â€


I didnâ€™t know what a carbon copy was, but based on his tone, it probably wasnâ€™t a good thing.


He stood, and I instinctively stepped back until my legs hit the couch.


â€œDo you remember what happened at the lake when you were five, darling Ava?â€ He brushed his fingers over my cheek, and I flinched.


I shook my head, too scared to speak.


â€œThatâ€™s for the best. Makes things easier.â€ Daddy smiled another ugly smile. â€œI wonder if youâ€™ll forget this too?â€ He picked up a throw pillow and pushed me onto the couch.


I didnâ€™t have time to respond before I lost the ability to breathe. The pillow pressed into my face, cutting off my oxygen supply. I tried to push it off, but I wasnâ€™t strong enough. A strong hand locked my wrists together until I couldnâ€™t struggle anymore.


My chest tightened, and my vision flickered.


No air. Noairnoairnoairâ€”

Not only had my father tried to drown me, heâ€™d also tried to suffocate me.
I retched again, and again, and again. Iâ€™d managed to stay calm for most of Thanksgiving weekend, but saying the words out loudâ€”my father tried to kill me
 â€”mustâ€™ve triggered a delayed physical response.
After Iâ€™d thrown up what mustâ€™ve been all the contents in my stomach, I sank onto the floor. Alex handed me a glass of water, and I downed it with long, grateful gulps.
â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€ I rasped. â€œThis is so embarrassing. Iâ€™ll clean upâ€”â€
â€œDonâ€™t worry about it.â€ He ran a gentle hand over my hair, but an inferno raged in his eyes. â€œWeâ€™ll figure everything out. Leave it to me.â€



* * *


A week later,
 Alex and I waited for my father to arrive in one of Archer Groupâ€™s conference rooms. It was my first time seeing Alexâ€™s workplace, and the building was exactly how Iâ€™d pictured it: sleek, modern, and beautiful, all glass and white marble.
I couldnâ€™t appreciate it, though. I was too nervous.
The clock ticked on the wall, deafening in the silence.
I drummed my fingers on the polished wood table and stared through the tinted glass windows, both willing and dreading my fatherâ€™s appearance.
â€œSecurity here is top-notch,â€ Alex reassured me. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll be by your side the entire time.â€
â€œThatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m worried about.â€ I had to press my other hand against my knee to keep it from bouncing. â€œI donâ€™t think he wouldâ€¦â€
Physically hurt me? But he had. Or at least, heâ€™d tried.
The day he pushed me into the lake, and the day he suffocated me. And those were only the instances I remembered.
I flashed back over the years, trying to remember anything else amiss. I thought heâ€™d been a decent father during my teenage years. Not the most present or affectionate, but he hadnâ€™t tried to kill me, which begged the question: why hadnâ€™t he? Thereâ€™d been plenty of opportunities, plenty of times when he couldâ€™ve made my death look like an accident.
But that question paled in comparison to the biggest one of all, which was why he wanted to kill me in the first place. I was his daughter.

A single broken sob erupted from my throat. Alex squeezed my hand, his brows drawn tight over his eyes, but I shook my head.
â€œIâ€™m okay,â€ I said, gathering the strength to pull myself together. I could do this. I wouldnâ€™t break down. I wouldnâ€™t.
 Even if my heart hurt so much I might combust. â€œIâ€”â€
The door opened, and my words died in my throat.
My fatherâ€”Michael; I couldnâ€™t think of him as my father anymoreâ€”walked in, looking confused and a little annoyed. He wore his favorite striped polo and jeans again, as well as that damn signet ring.
I choked back bile. Beside me, Alex tensed, wrath radiating from him in dark, dangerous waves.
â€œWhatâ€™s going on?â€ Michael frowned. â€œAva? Why did you ask me to come here?â€
â€œMr. Chen.â€ Alexâ€™s voice seemed pleasant enough; only those who knew him could detect the lethal blade beneath his words, waiting to strike. â€œPlease, take a seat.â€ He gestured at the leather chair on the other side of the table.
Michael did, his expression growing more irritated. â€œI have work to do, and you made me come all the way to D.C. for a supposed emergency.â€
â€œI sent a car,â€ Alex said, still in that deceptively pleasant tone.
â€œYour car or mine, it takes the same amount of time.â€ Michaelâ€™s eyes flicked between Alex and me before settling on me. â€œDonâ€™t tell me youâ€™re pregnant.â€
Confirmation he knew Alex and I had been an item at Thanksgiving. Not that I cared what he thought anymore.
â€œNo.â€ I raised my voice so I could hear it over my pounding pulse. â€œIâ€™m not.â€
â€œThen whatâ€™s the emergency?â€
â€œIâ€”â€ I faltered. Alex squeezed my hand again. â€œIâ€”â€
I couldnâ€™t say it. Not with an audience.
Alex already knew everything, but what Michael and I had to discuss seemed too personal to air out in front of other people. It was between us. Father and daughter.
Pinpricks of light danced before my vision. I dug the nails of my free hand into my thigh so hard I wouldâ€™ve drawn blood had I not been wearing jeans.
â€œAlex, can you let us have a moment alone, please?â€
His head whipped toward me, his expression thunderous.

Please,
 I begged with my eyes. I need to do this on my own.

Knowing how protective he was, I expected more resistance, but he mustâ€™ve seen something in my faceâ€”my unshakeable belief that I had to fight my own battlesâ€”because he released my hand and stood.
Reluctantly, but he did it.
â€œIâ€™ll be right outside,â€ he said. A promise and a warning.
Alex shot a dark look at Michael before he exited.

And then there were two.

â€œAva?â€ Michael raised his eyebrows. â€œAre you in trouble?â€

Yes.

Iâ€™d run through this conversation in my mind hundreds, if not thousands, of times before I stepped foot in this room. Iâ€™d labored over how to bring up the topic and how Iâ€™d react to his response, whatever it may be. Oh hey, Dad, nice to see you. By the way, did you try to murder me? Yes? Oh damn, okay.
 But I couldnâ€™t drag it out any longer.
I needed answers before the questions killed me.
â€œIâ€™m not in trouble,â€ I said, proud of how steady I sounded. â€œBut I have something to tell you about what happened over Thanksgiving weekend.â€
Wariness crept into his eyes. â€œOkayâ€¦â€
â€œI remembered.â€
â€œRemembered what?â€
â€œEverything.â€ I watched him closely for a reaction. â€œMy childhood. The day I almost drowned.â€
Wariness morphed into shock and a faint tinge of panic. Deep grooves appeared in his forehead.
My stomach dropped. Iâ€™d hoped Iâ€™d been wrong, but the wild look in Michaelâ€™s eyes told me all I needed to knowâ€”I wasnâ€™t wrong. He really had tried to kill me.
â€œReally?â€ His chuckle sounded forced. â€œAre you sure? Youâ€™ve been having nightmares for yearsâ€”â€
â€œIâ€™m sure.â€ I straightened my shoulders and looked him straight in the eye, trying to keep my trembles under control. â€œWere you the one who pushed me into the lake that day?â€
Michaelâ€™s face collapsed, the shock in his eyes tripling. â€œWhat?â€ he whispered.
â€œYou heard me.â€
â€œNo, of course not!â€ He raked a hand through his graying hair, agitated. â€œHow could you think that? Iâ€™m your father.
 I would never do anything to hurt you.â€
Hope whispered through my heart even as my brain shook its head in skepticism. â€œThatâ€™s what I remember.â€
â€œMemories can deceive. We remember things that didnâ€™t actually happen.â€ Michael leaned forward, his face softening. â€œWhat exactly do you think happened?â€
I gnawed on my bottom lip. â€œI was playing by the lake. Someone came up behind me and pushed me. I remembered turning around and seeing a flash of gold. A signet ring. Your
 signet ring.â€ My gaze dropped to said ring on his finger.
He glanced down and rubbed it. â€œAva.â€ He sounded pained. â€œI was the one who saved you from drowning.â€
That was the part that didnâ€™t make sense. Iâ€™d passed out, so I hadnâ€™t seen whoâ€™d saved me, but the paramedics and police said Michael had been the one who called them. Why would he do that if he was the one who pushed me in?
â€œI came over to speak with your mother about the divorce, and no one answered the door even though her car was in the driveway. I went around back to see if she was out there, and I sawâ€”â€ Michael swallowed hard. â€œIt was the worst few minutes of my life, thinking you were dead. I jumped in and saved you, and all the while your motherâ€¦she just stood there in shock. Like she couldnâ€™t believe what had happened.â€ His voice dropped. â€œYour mother wasnâ€™t well, Ava. She didnâ€™t mean to harm you, but sometimes she did things out of her control. She felt so guilty afterward, and between the divorce and criminal chargesâ€¦thatâ€™s why she overdosed.â€
Pain ripped through my head. I pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to sort through my fatherâ€™s words and my own memories. What was real? What wasnâ€™t?
Memories were unreliable. I knew that. And Michael sounded sincere. But had I really been that off base? Where did those visions come from, if not my memories?
â€œThereâ€™s another instance,â€ I said shakily. â€œThird grade. I brought home an essay from Mrs. Jamesâ€™s class and showed you. We were in your office. You looked at me and said I was a carbon copy of Mom and youâ€¦you pushed a pillow into my face and tried to suffocate me. I couldnâ€™t breathe. I wouldâ€™ve died, but Josh came home and called for you, and you stopped.â€
The story sounded ridiculous beneath the bright lights of the conference room. My head pounded harder.
Alarm spread across Michaelâ€™s features. â€œAva,â€ he said softly, calmly, like he didnâ€™t want to spook me. â€œYou never had a teacher named Mrs. James.â€
My heart crashed against my chest. â€œI did! She had blonde hair and glasses, and she gave us sugar cookies on our birthdaysâ€¦â€ Tears prickled my eyes. â€œI swear, Mrs. James was real.â€
She had to be real. But what if she wasnâ€™t? What if Iâ€™d made everything up and thought
 they were memories? What was wrong with me? Why was my brain so messed up?
I couldnâ€™t breathe. I felt crazy, like nothing in my life was real and Iâ€™d dreamed it all up. I pressed my palms into the table, half-expecting it to dissolve in a shower of dust.
â€œHoneyâ€¦â€ He reached for me, but before he could touch me, the door banged open.
â€œThatâ€™s enough. Stop lying.â€ Alex strode in, his face like thunder. Of course he had this place wired. â€œI had my people investigate after Ava told me what she remembered,â€ he said coldly. He did?
 He never told me that. â€œYouâ€™d be surprised how muchâ€”and how quicklyâ€”one can find out with the right amount of money. She did
 have a third-grade teacher named Mrs. Jamesâ€”one who reported suspicious bruising on Avaâ€™s wrists when she came into class the next day. You claimed it was a playground injury, and they believed you.â€ Alexâ€™s eyes burned with disgust. â€œYouâ€™re a good actor, but drop the mask. Weâ€™re onto you.â€
I stared at Michael. I didnâ€™t know what to believe anymore. â€œIs that true? You were gaslighting me this whole time?â€
â€œAva, Iâ€™m your father.â€ Michael rubbed a hand over his face, his eyes bright. â€œI would never lie to you.â€
I looked between him and Alex. My head pounded harder. There was too much going on, too many secrets to reveal. But in the end, I had to trust myself.
â€œI think you would,â€ I said. â€œI think youâ€™ve been lying to me my entire life.â€
Michaelâ€™s face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile.
He didnâ€™t look like my father anymore. He didnâ€™t look human at all. He looked like a monster straight from my nightmares.
â€œBravo.â€ He slow-clapped. â€œI almost had you,â€ he told me. â€œYou shouldâ€™ve seen yourself. I swear, Mrs. James was real,
 â€ he mimicked, laughing. The ugly sound raised every hair on my body. â€œClassic. You really thought you were crazy.â€
I gave a subtle shake of my head when Alex moved toward Michael. I wanted to run and hide, but adrenaline pushed the words out of my mouth. â€œWhy? I was a kid
 .â€ My chin wobbled. â€œIâ€™m your daughter. Why would you do those things to me? Tell me the truth.â€ I tightened my jaw. â€œNo. More. Lies.â€
â€œThe truth is subjective.â€ Michael leaned back in his chair. â€œBut you want to know so bad? Hereâ€™s my truthâ€”youâ€™re not really my daughter.â€ He flashed a humorless smile at my sharp intake of breath. â€œThatâ€™s right. Your bitch of a mom cheated on me. Mustâ€™ve been one of those times I was away for business. She always complained I wasnâ€™t around enough, like it wasnâ€™t my fucking business that put the roof over her head and kept her nice and warm in designer clothes. Iâ€™d always suspected you werenâ€™t mineâ€”you look nothing like me, but I figured, hey, maybe you just have a strong resemblance to Wendy. I took a secret paternity test and lo-and-behold, you really arenâ€™t mine. Your mother tried to deny it, but there wasnâ€™t much she could do with the evidence staring her in the face.â€ His expression darkened. â€œOf course, we couldnâ€™t mention that in the divorce proceedings. Those things always leak, and we wouldâ€™ve both lost face.â€
There were few things worse than losing face in Chinese culture. Except, of course, trying to murder your daughter.
â€œIf Iâ€™m not your daughter, why did you fight so hard for custody?â€ I demanded, my tongue thick in my mouth.
Michaelâ€™s lips curled into a sneer. â€œI didnâ€™t fight for custody for you.
 I did it for Josh. Heâ€™s actually
 my son. Test confirmed it. My legacy, my heir. But since no one other than your mother and I knew you werenâ€™t mine, you and Josh were a package deal. Unfortunately, courts almost always side with the mother except in extraordinary circumstances, soâ€¦â€ He shrugged. â€œI had to engineer an extraordinary circumstance.â€
I felt sick, but I stayed frozen while Michael unraveled the tangled web of our past.
â€œI was lucky your mom was stupid enough to leave you alone. Honestly, that was negligence on its own. But I snuck into the house, intending to plant evidence of her â€˜drug addictionâ€™, and I found you playing by the lake instead. It was like God dropped the opportunity into my lap. Sometimes, courts side with the mother even if sheâ€™s a drug addict, but trying to drown
 her child? Guaranteed win for me. Not to mention, itâ€™d be punishment for her. So I pushed you in. I was tempted to let you drown for real.â€ Another flash of teeth. â€œBut I wasnâ€™t that
 cold-hearted. You were just a kid. So I fished you out, told authorities I saw Wendy push you in. She kept screaming she didnâ€™t do it, but you wanna know the real genius of my plan?â€ He leaned forward, his eyes sparkling. â€œYou
 were the one who implicated your mother.â€
â€œNo.â€ I shook my head. â€œI didnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t even seeâ€”I didnâ€™t rememberâ€”â€
â€œNot after. But in the moment?â€ He smirked. â€œItâ€™s quite easy to implant false memories, especially in the mind of a confused, traumatized child. A few suggestions and leading questions from me, and you were convinced it was your mom. Said you smelled her perfume, plus she was the only person there. Either way, authorities had to investigate, and they gave me custody of you and Josh while they gathered evidence. Your mom became depressed and, well, you know what happened with the pills. Itâ€™s pretty poetic, actually. She died of the very thing Iâ€™d wanted to frame her forâ€”at 4:44 a.m., no less. The unluckiest time.â€
My stomach lurched. 4:44 a.m.
 The time I awoke from my nightmares.
Iâ€™ve never been a superstitious person, but I couldnâ€™t help wondering if that had been my mom screaming at me from the other side, urging me to remember. To leave the sociopath whose house Iâ€™d been living in all these years.
â€œWhat about that day in your office?â€ I asked, determined to see this through even though I wanted to throw up.
Michael snorted. â€œRight. That stupid essay about how I â€˜savedâ€™ you. You know, I did a pretty good job of hiding how much I resented having to raise you, the â€˜daughterâ€™ whoâ€™s not even my own, all those years. I played the role of the quiet, awkward, grief-stricken father to a tee.â€ His ugly smile reappeared. â€œBut sometimes, you push my limits, especially since you look so much like her.
 A living reminder of her infidelity. It wouldâ€™ve been so easy if you were out of the picture, but Josh chose that moment to come home. Alas.â€ He lifted his shoulder in a shrug. â€œCanâ€™t have it all. To be fair, the office incident was a moment of weakness on my partâ€”you were very much aware of what was going on, and I wouldâ€™ve had a helluva time explaining what happened, though Iâ€™m sure I wouldâ€™ve come up with something.
 But imagine my pleasant surprise when you woke up with not only no recollection of the office, but no recollection of your entire childhood up to that point. Doctors couldnâ€™t explain it, but it didnâ€™t matter. All that mattered was you forgot.â€ He smiled. â€œGod really does smile on me, doesnâ€™t he?â€
I felt Alexâ€™s hands on my back. I hadnâ€™t even noticed him approach. I leaned into the comfort of his touch while my mind spun. I remembered running to my room and locking the door after Michael released me and greeted Josh like nothing had happened. I stayed there all night, refusing to eat dinner no matter how much Josh tried to persuade me to come out. Heâ€™d only been thirteen at the timeâ€”too young to help meâ€”and I had no one else to turn to.
I wondered if Iâ€™d been so panicked and traumatized that Iâ€™d blacked out all
 of my experiences with Michael, which was basically my entire childhood.
â€œI couldnâ€™t be sure Iâ€™d be as lucky again, though,â€ Michael continued. â€œSo I left you alone after that. Even sent you to therapy because I had to play the part of the concerned father, but it was a good thing those incompetent idiots didnâ€™t know what they were doing.â€
No wonder heâ€™d been so adamant about stopping my therapy sessions. He mustâ€™ve been terrified I would remember and implicate him. Which begged the questionâ€¦why the hell was he so willing to tell me all of this now?

It was like Alex read my mind. â€œThereâ€™s no statute of limitations for attempted murder, and this entire conversation is recorded,â€ he said. â€œD.C. has a one-party consent law for recordings, and Avaâ€”â€ He gestured at me. â€œConsented beforehand. Youâ€™re going to jail for a long, long time.â€
Michaelâ€™s mask of malice melted, leaving behind the â€œfatherâ€ who took me on college visits and planned my birthday parties again. It was terrifying how easily he switched between the two. â€œIf I have to go to jail to save her, I will,â€ he whispered. He turned to me, his eyes shining with actual tears. â€œAva, honey, Alex is not who you think he is. His driver picked me up, and on the way here, he threatened meâ€”â€
â€œEnough,â€ Alex hissed. â€œNo more gaslighting her. Youâ€™re done, and my friends would agree.â€
I watched in shock as two FBI agents burst into the room and hauled Michael out of his chair. Alex hadnâ€™t mentioned the FBI when weâ€™d planned this.
â€œThis wonâ€™t hold up in court,â€ Michael said, sounding quite calm for someone entering federal custody. â€œIâ€™ll fight it. You wonâ€™t win.â€
â€œWith what money?â€ Alex raised his eyebrows. â€œYou see, my people found some interesting things about your business during their digging as well. Interesting, illegal
 things. Tax evasion. Corporate fraud. Ring any bells?â€
For the first time since he arrived, Michaelâ€™s composure slipped. â€œYouâ€™re lying,â€ he hissed. â€œYou had no authorityâ€”â€
â€œAu contraire, I worked with the FBI on that part. My friends at the agency were quite interested in what I had to say, and what they found.â€ Alex smiled. â€œYou can use your untainted assets to hire an attorney, but most of your assets are
 tainted and will be frozen before your trial. Youâ€™ll receive the official notice before the end of today.â€
â€œJosh will never forgive you for this.â€ Michaelâ€™s eyes burned. â€œHe worships me. Who do you think heâ€™ll believe? Me, his father, or you, a punk he met a few years ago?â€
â€œIn this case, Fatherâ€”â€ Josh walked in, his face darker than Iâ€™d ever seen it. â€œI think Iâ€™ll believe â€˜the punkâ€™.â€
He slammed his fist into Michaelâ€™s face, and all hell broke loose.

Ava






Several hours later,
 Josh and I sat in the back booth of a restaurant near The Archer Group. Alex had booked the entire place and dismissed most of the staff. Other than a waiter who hovered by the entrance, out of earshot, we were the only ones here. Alex, too, had retreated to his office to give us more privacy.
â€œIâ€™m so sorry, Ave.â€ Josh looked terrible. Lackluster complexion, huge bags beneath his eyes. Stress and worry carved deep grooves in his face, and his usual cocky, charming grin was nowhere to be seen. â€œI shouldâ€™ve known. I shouldâ€™veâ€”â€
â€œItâ€™s not your fault. Dadâ€”Michaelâ€”fooled all
 of us.â€ I shuddered, thinking about how well Michael had played his role. â€œBesides, he loved you. He treated you perfectly. You wouldnâ€™t have noticed anything.â€
Joshâ€™s lips thinned. â€œHe didnâ€™t love me. People like him canâ€™t love. He saw me as aâ€¦vessel to continue his legacy. Nothing else.â€
Alex and I had contacted Josh and told him what I remembered a few days ago. Heâ€™d been shocked, but heâ€™d believed me. Heâ€™d also insisted on flying back for the confrontation and received emergency leave from his program to do so. Heâ€™d watched and listened to the conversation via the conference roomâ€™s secret cameras the entire time, and Alexâ€™s security team had had to restrain him so he didnâ€™t burst in too early.
I could only imagine. Josh was nothing if not hot-tempered.
After he punched Michael, the situation had devolved into chaos, with the FBI agents, Josh, Michael, and various security guards grappling with each other. Josh would have beaten the hell out of ourâ€”hisâ€”father, had Alex not finally pulled him back. The FBI agents hauled a bruised and bleeding Michael into custody, and now we awaited his trial.
Thanks to Alex, whose friendâ€™s father was apparently high up in the FBI, Josh didnâ€™t get charged with assault for attacking Michael.
The entire situation felt surreal.
â€œEither way, it wasnâ€™t your fault,â€ I repeated. â€œYou were just a kid too.â€
â€œIf Iâ€™d been there that day in his officeâ€¦â€
â€œStop it. Do you hear me, Josh Chen?â€ I said sternly. â€œI will not
 let you blame yourself. Mom and Michael were adults. They made their own choices.â€ I swallowed, feeling guilty about my suppressed rage toward my mother over the years when, in fact, sheâ€™d been a victim too. â€œYouâ€™ve always
 been there when I needed you, and you are an amazing brother. Iâ€™ll only say that once, so donâ€™t ask me to repeat it. Your ego doesnâ€™t need more inflation.â€
He cracked a small smile. â€œAre you going to be okay?â€
I took a deep breath. The past two weeks had beenâ€¦a lot. The revelations, the mind fucks, the sinking realization that I was practically an orphan. My mother was dead, my father wasnâ€™t my real fatherâ€”and would probably be locked up for a long timeâ€”and I had no clue who my actual father was. But at least I knew the truth, and I had Josh, Alex, and my friends.
Maybe the import of what happened would hit me later, but for now, all I felt was relief mingled with sadness and lingering shock.
â€œYeah,â€ I said. â€œI will.â€
Josh mustâ€™ve heard my conviction, because his shoulders relaxed the tiniest bit. â€œIf you need to talk or anything, Iâ€™m here. Canâ€™t guarantee Iâ€™ll give good advice, but Iâ€™ll be a sounding board or whatever.â€
I smiled. â€œThanks, Joshy.â€
He made a face at his hated nickname. â€œHow many times do I have to tell you? Donâ€™t
 call me that.â€
We spent the next half hour talking about lighter topicsâ€”his time in Central America, what D.C. luxuries heâ€™d indulge in before he returned to his volunteer program, and his now-dead relationship with the girl heâ€™d told me about. Apparently, heâ€™d ended things immediately after she brought up marriage. Typical Josh.
As annoying as he was, I had missed him, and I would be sad to see him leave. He was coming home for Christmas, but he couldnâ€™t take the entire period between now and then off, so he was leaving tomorrow and flying back in two weeks.
However, we still had one elephant in the room we needed to discuss.
â€œNow that we got all the small stuff out of the wayâ€¦â€ A scowl overtook Joshâ€™s face. â€œYou and Alex. What. The. Fuck?â€
I cringed. â€œWe didnâ€™t plan it, I promise. It just sort ofâ€¦happened.â€
â€œYou just â€˜happenedâ€™ to fall into bed with my best friend?â€
â€œDonâ€™t be mad.â€
â€œIâ€™m not mad at you,â€ Josh snapped. â€œIâ€™m mad at him.
 He shouldâ€™ve known better!â€
â€œAnd I donâ€™t
 know better?â€
â€œYou know what I mean. Youâ€™re a romantic. I can see you falling for that broody asshole thing he has going on. But Alexâ€¦Jesus Christ, Ave.â€ Josh rubbed a hand over his face. â€œHeâ€™s my best friend, but even I shudder at the things he does. In all the years Iâ€™ve known him, heâ€™s never once been in a relationship. Never shown an interest in it. He cares about work, and thatâ€™s it.â€
â€œYes, he can be an asshole sometimes, but heâ€™s still human. He needs love and care like anyone else,â€ I said, feeling protective of Alex even though he was the last person on earth who needed protection. â€œAs for the relationship part, thereâ€™s a first time for everything. Heâ€™s beenâ€¦â€ I swallowed hard. â€œYou have no idea how much heâ€™s helped me these past few months. He was there for everything. The nightmares, the panic attacksâ€¦he taught me how to swim. Swim,
 Josh. He helped me get over my fear of water, at least a little bit, and he was so patient the entire time. But beyond how much heâ€™s helped me, heâ€™s smart and funny and wonderful. He makes me laugh and believe in myself, more than anyone else ever has. And he may not show it to the world, but he does
 have a heart. A beautiful one.â€
I cut myself off before I rambled further, my cheeks a deep, bright red.
Josh stared at me, shock stamped on every inch of his face. â€œAva,â€ he said. â€œDo you...love him?â€
A lot of things in my life had been hazy up to this point, but my feelings about this were clear. I didnâ€™t hesitate before answering.
â€œYes.â€ I may not know what was in my mind, but I knew what was in my heart. â€œI do.â€



* * *


Josh left
 the next morning after threatening to kill Alex if he ever broke my heart. He was still uncomfortable with our relationship, but heâ€™d grudgingly accepted it after he saw how much I cared about Alex.
Alex had urgent business to take care of after he dropped Josh off at the airport, so I spent the rest of the day with my girls. Since it was drizzling and I wasnâ€™t up for going out, we had an at-home spa day, complete with DIY facials, mani-pedis, and a marathon of feel-good movies.
Iâ€™d told them what had happened with Michael. Theyâ€™d been stunned, but none of them pressed me on it, for which I was grateful. It had been a heavy twenty-four hours, and I needed lighthearted downtime.
Stella checked her phone before pushing it away with an uncharacteristic frown.
â€œIs it that creep again?â€ Jules asked, blowing on her freshly polished gold nails.
Some random guy had been messaging Stella nonstop for the past two weeks, and it was making her nervous. As an influencer, she received her fair share of unsolicited DMs from creepy guys, but this one put her on edge more than normal.
â€œYeah. I blocked him, but he keeps making new accounts.â€ Stella sighed. â€œThatâ€™s the sucky part about being a semi-public figure.â€
â€œBe careful.â€ A shadow of worry crossed Bridgetâ€™s face. â€œThere are crazy people out there.â€
Rhys, who kept watch from the armchair, snorted, no doubt because that was what he always told herâ€”and she always ignored him, like she did now.
Bridget refused to look at him as she lowered the volume on Mean Girls.
 That mustâ€™ve been the thousandth time weâ€™d watched it, but it never got old. Regina George was iconic.
â€œI will. Heâ€™s likely another Internet weirdo.â€ Stella made a face. â€œThatâ€™s why I never post my Stories until after Iâ€™ve left a place.â€
I couldnâ€™t imagine documenting my life online the way Stella did. I worried for both her physical safety and mental health sometimes, but sheâ€™d handled it well so far. Maybe I was just being a worrywart.
Someone knocked on the door.
â€œIâ€™ll get it.â€ Rhys unfolded himself to his full six feet, five inches. Seriously, the man was enormous. He probably wore custom-made clothes because no way would an off-the-rack shirt fit those big shoulders and broad chest.
â€œLook at that ass.â€ Jules sighed. â€œTalk about a tight end.â€
â€œStop objectifying him. Thatâ€™s Bridgetâ€™s bodyguard,
 â€ I said, nudging her in the ribs.
â€œExactly. Bodyguards are hot. Donâ€™t you think so, Bridge?â€
â€œNo,â€ Bridget said flatly.
â€œYou guys are no fun.â€ Jules twisted her red hair into a messy topknot. â€œOoh, look who comes bearing gifts.â€
My stomach fluttered when Alex walked in with Rhys on his heels. He carried a distinctive black-and-white striped box.
â€œCake?â€ Stella perked up. Sheâ€™d warmed up to Alex over the past month after seeing he was â€œcapable of human emotion after all.â€
â€œCupcakes,â€ Alex confirmed, setting the goodies on the table.
My friends dove for the box like treasure hunters diving for gold.
I smiled and tilted my head up so I could kiss him. â€œThank you. You didnâ€™t have to do that.â€
â€œItâ€™s just cupcakes.â€ He returned my kiss before sitting next to me and curling a protective arm around my waist. â€œFigured you could use the sugar rush.â€
I peeled the wrapper away from my red velvet cupcake with a small frown. It would take a long time to get over what Michael did. I wasnâ€™t sure I would ever
 get over what Michael did. My entire life was a lie. Sometimes, Iâ€™d lie awake at night, so anxious I couldnâ€™t sleep or think straight. Other times, like now, Iâ€™d look around me and comfort myself with the knowledge that I would be all right. That old saying was true: what doesnâ€™t kill you makes you stronger. Iâ€™d almost died twice in my lifeâ€”that I knew ofâ€”and I was still standing. Iâ€™d continue to stand tall, long after Michael rotted in jail.
Thanks to a nudge from Alex, who knew half the judges in this town, Michael was locked up with no bail until his court date. Heâ€™d sent a message asking me to see him, but I refused. I had nothing left to say to him. Heâ€™d shown me his real face, and I would be happy if I never saw it again for the rest of my life.
But yeah, sometimes a girl needed a cupcake or two to get her through the rainy days.
Part of me was grateful Michael and I had never been close. If we had, I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d be able to take the heartbreak. That was why I worried about Josh, who was his real son and whoâ€™d had a much closer relationship with him. But Josh insisted he was fine, and there was no arguing with him. He was even more stubborn than me.
We ate in silence for a while before Stella cleared her throat. â€œUm, thanks for the treat, but I should head out. I have a brand collab I need to shoot.â€
â€œMe, too,â€ Bridget added, picking up on Stellaâ€™s cue. â€œI have a political theory paper to write.â€
After Stella, Bridget, and Rhys beat a hasty retreat, Jules announced she had a date tonight and needed to get ready. She swept up the stairs, taking half the remaining cupcakes with her.
â€œYou know how to clear a room,â€ I teased, running an absentminded hand down Alexâ€™s arm. What would I do without him? Not only had he helped me confront my fatherâ€”I mean, Michaelâ€”but he was helping me deal with the aftermath, including all the financial and legal webs I was now tangled up in. Most of Michaelâ€™s assets had been frozen, but luckily, heâ€™d already paid my tuition for the year, and I had a steady income from my job and side gig. The commission I received for selling the Richard Argus piece to Alex helped too. Josh, whoâ€™d received a full-ride scholarship plus living stipend for the duration of med school, was also set money-wise. At least that was one less thing we had to worry about.
â€œItâ€™s one of my many talents.â€ Alex captured my mouth in a searing kiss, and I melted into him, letting his tongue and taste and touch carry me away to a land where my troubles didnâ€™t exist.
God, I loved this man, and he didnâ€™t even know it. Not yet.
My pulse thundered in my ears when we pulled apart. â€œAlexâ€¦â€
â€œHmm?â€ He brushed his fingers over my skin, his gaze still locked on my mouth.
â€œI have something to tell you. Iâ€”â€ Tell him. Itâ€™s now or never.
 â€œI love you,â€ I whispered, my heart beating fast, my confession a breathless rush.
A beat passed, followed by a second. Third.
Alexâ€™s hand stilled, his expression fierce and strangely haunted. A wisp of unease niggled at my stomach.
â€œYou donâ€™t mean that.â€
â€œYes, I do,â€ I said, hurt and a little angry at his reaction. â€œI know what I feel.â€
â€œIâ€™m not an easy person to love.â€
â€œGood thing I never cared much about taking the easy road.â€ I sat up straight and looked him straight in the eyes. â€œYou are cold and infuriating and, I admit, a little scary. But you are also patient and supportive and brilliant. You inspire me to chase my dreams and drive away my nightmares. You are everything I didnâ€™t know I needed, and you make me feel safer than anyone else on the planet.â€ I took a deep breath. â€œWhat Iâ€™m trying to sayâ€”againâ€”is, I love you, Alex Volkov. Every part of you, even the parts I want to slap.â€
A smile ghosted his mouth. â€œThat was quite the speech.â€ The smile faded as quickly as it had come, and he dropped his forehead to mine, his breath ragged. â€œYou are the light to my dark, Sunshine,â€ he said in a raw voice. His lips brushed against mine as he spoke. â€œWithout you, Iâ€™m lost.â€
Our kiss was even deeper this time, more urgent, but his response played on a loop in the back of my mind.

You are the light to my dark. Without you, Iâ€™m lost.

Beautiful words that made my heart poundâ€¦but I couldnâ€™t help noticing none of them were â€œI love you too.â€

Alex






The iron gates slid open,
 revealing a long driveway lined with northern red oak trees, their branches bare and brown in the harsh cold of winter, and the large brick mansion looming in the distance.
My uncleâ€™s houseâ€”my house as well, before Iâ€™d moved to D.C.â€”stood behind a virtual fortress on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and that was the way he liked it.
I hadnâ€™t wanted to leave Ava so soon after the shitshow with Michael, but Iâ€™d put off this meeting with my uncle long enough.
I found him in his office, smoking and watching a Russian drama on the flat-screen TV hanging in the corner. I never understood why he insisted on watching TV in here when he had a perfectly good den.
â€œAlex.â€ He blew a smoke ring in the air. A half-empty cup of green tea sat before him. Heâ€™d been obsessed with the drink ever since he read an article that said it helped with weight loss. â€œTo what do I owe this surprise?â€
â€œYou know why Iâ€™m here.â€ I sank into the overstuffed chair opposite Ivan and picked up the ugly gold paperweight on his desk. It looked like a deformed monkey.
â€œAh, yes. I heard. Checkmate.â€ My uncle smiled. â€œCongratulations. Though I have to admit, it was a bit anticlimactic. Iâ€™d expected your final move to go off with more of aâ€¦bang.â€
My jaw tightened. â€œThe situation changed, and I had to adapt.â€
Ivanâ€™s gaze turned knowing. â€œAnd what about the situation changed?â€
I stayed silent.
Iâ€™d labored over my revenge plan for more than a decade, moving and manipulating every piece until I had them where I wanted them. Always play the long game.

But even I had to admit Iâ€™d gottenâ€¦distracted these past few months. Ava had swept into my life like a sunrise after dark, awakening creatures within my soul that I thought had died a long time ago: guilt. Conscience. Remorse.
Making me question whether the ends justified the means.
Around her, my thirst for vengeance slaked, and I almostâ€”almostâ€”gave it up, if only so I could pretend to be the man she thought I was. You have a multilayered heart, Alex. A heart of gold encased in a heart of ice.

The sharp edges of the paperweight dug into my palm.
Ava knew Iâ€™d committed my fair share of unsavory deeds for Archer Group, but that was business. She didnâ€™t condone it or endorse it, but she wasnâ€™t naÃ¯ve, either. For all her romantic notions and soft heart, sheâ€™d grown up near the D.C. viper pit and understood that in certain situationsâ€”whether it be business or politicsâ€”it was eat or be eaten.
But if she found out the lengths to which Iâ€™d gone in order to wreak havoc on those responsible for my familyâ€™s deathâ€”no matter how much they deserved itâ€”she would never forgive me.
There are some lines you never cross.
A tiny well of blood blossomed on my hand. I released the paperweight, wiped the blood off on my conveniently dark pants, and set it back on the table.
â€œDonâ€™t worry about it, Uncle.â€ I kept my face and posture relaxed. I didnâ€™t want him finding out how much Ava had burrowed inside my heart.
My uncle had never been in love, had never married or fathered children of his own, and he wouldnâ€™t understand my dilemma. For him, wealth, power, and status were all that mattered.
â€œAh, but I do worry.â€ Ivan puffed on his cigarette with a small frown. Heâ€™d slicked his hair back and wore a suit and tie even though he was alone in his office, watching a stupid drama about Cold War spies. He was always conscious of his appearance, even when there was no one else around. He switched from English to Ukrainian for the next part of our conversation. â€œYou have not been acting like yourself. Youâ€™ve been distracted. Unfocused. Carolina mentioned you only go into the office a few days a week, and you leave before seven each time.â€
I tamped down my flare of irritation. â€œMy assistant shouldnâ€™t be blabbing about my schedule to others.â€
â€œIâ€™m the CEO, so she didnâ€™t have much choice.â€ Ivan stubbed out his cigarette and leaned forward, his eyes intense. â€œTell me about Ava.â€
Tension rocketed down my spine at the sound of her name on his lips. I didnâ€™t have to ask how he knew about herâ€”I wasnâ€™t the only one with spies everywhere. â€œThereâ€™s nothing to tell. Sheâ€™s a good lay,â€ I said, the words poison on my tongue. â€œThatâ€™s it.â€
â€œHmm.â€ My uncle looked skeptical. â€œSo, your revenge. Thatâ€™s it?â€ He switched topics so abruptly it took me half a second longer than usual to respond.
â€œNo.â€ I wasnâ€™t done with the man Iâ€™d destroyed. Not yet. â€œThereâ€™s more.â€
I had one final ace up my sleeve.
I wanted to take everything from the man whoâ€™d taken everything from me. His business, his family, his life.

And I did. I would.
But was it worth it?
â€œGood. I thought youâ€™d gone soft.â€ Ivan sighed and stared at the framed picture on his desk of him and my father when they were young. Theyâ€™d just moved to the U.S., and they both wore cheap, happy suits and matching hats. While my uncle looked stern and serious, my fatherâ€™s eyes twinkled like he was in on a grand secret no one else knew. My throat squeezed at the sight. â€œNever forget what happened to your parents and poor little Nina. They deserve all the justice in the world.â€
As if I would ever forget. Even if I didnâ€™t have HSAM, the scene would forever be engraved in my mind.

â€œDonâ€™t cheat!â€ I yelled over my shoulder as I ran to the bathroom. Iâ€™d had two apple juices this morning, and I was about to burst. â€œIâ€™ll know.â€


â€œYouâ€™re losing, anyway!â€ my little sister Nina yelled back, causing my parents to chuckle.


I stuck my tongue out at her before slamming the bathroom door behind me. I was annoyed Iâ€™d never beaten Nina at Scrabble for Kids, even though she was two years younger than me and I had a â€œgeniusâ€ IQ, according to my teachers and parents. Sheâ€™d always been good at words. Mama said sheâ€™d probably grow up to be a writer.


I used the toilet and washed my hands.


I was supposed to be at a special camp for gifted children this summer, but camp was so boring. All the activities were too easy; the only one Iâ€™d liked was chess, but I could play that anywhere. I complained to my parents, who pulled me out yesterday and brought me home.


I was drying my hands when I heard a loud bang in the distance, followed by shouts.


I ran back to the living room, where I found my parents ushering Nina toward the secret passageway behind the fireplace. That was one thing I loved about our houseâ€”it was full of secret passageways and hidden corners. Nina and I had spent countless hours exploring every nook and cranny; it made hide and seek more exciting, that was for sure.


â€œAlex, get in there. Quick!â€ Mamaâ€™s face was tight with panic. She grabbed my arm, more roughly than she ever had before, and pushed me into the darkness.


â€œWhatâ€™s going on? Whoâ€™s here?â€ My heart beat a fast rhythm. I heard strange voices, and they were getting closer.


Nina cowered in the passageway, clutching her beloved cat, Smudges, to her chest. Weâ€™d stumbled on the stray one day during a family picnic in the park, and she cried and begged until my parents agreed to let her keep it as a pet.


â€œItâ€™ll be okay.â€ Papa had a gun in his hand. He always kept one in the house, but Iâ€™d never seen him use it. The sight of that shiny black metal glinting beneath the lights made my blood run cold. â€œGet in there with your sister and mother, and donâ€™t make a sound. Everything will be fineâ€”Lucia, what are you doing?â€


Mama swung the passageway shut while Nina and I stared with wide eyes.


â€œIâ€™m not leaving you out here alone,â€ she said fiercely.


â€œDammit, Lucy. You have toâ€”â€


The sound of a vase crashing to the floor interrupted Papa and startled Smudges, who yowled and broke free of Ninaâ€™s arms. He darted through the narrowing gap between the wall and passageway door.


â€œSmudges!â€ Nina yelled, scrambling after him.


I tried to grab her, but she wriggled out of my grasp and chased after him.


â€œNina, no,â€ I whisper-yelled, but it was too late. She was gone, and the door shut, enveloping me in darkness. I sat there, my blood roaring in my ears while my eyes tried to adjust to the dark.


Mama and Papa put me in here for a reason, and I didnâ€™t want to worry them by leaving. But I also needed to know what was going on, even though something screamed at me to turn away, to cover my eyes and hide.


I
 was hiding, but I wouldnâ€™t cover my eyes.


The fireplace passageway had a peephole disguised as the eyes in a painting that hung above the mantel. I was a little too short, but if I stood on tiptoes and
 really stretched, I could look out into the living room.


What I saw made my blood run cold.


There were two strange men in the living room. They wore ski masks and carried gunsâ€”bigger than the one Papa had, which now lay at his feet. One of those guns pointed at Papa, the other at Mama and Nina. Mama covered Nina protectively while my sister cried and hugged Smudges tight. The cat was freaking out and yowling at the top of its lungs.


â€œShut that damn thing up,â€ one of the men growled. â€œOr Iâ€™ll do it for you.â€


Nina cried harder.


â€œTake whatever you want,â€ Papa said, his face pale. â€œJust donâ€™t hurt my family.â€


â€œOh, weâ€™ll take whatever we want,â€ the second man. â€œUnfortunately, I canâ€™t guarantee the second part. In fact, letâ€™s make this quick, shall we? No use dragging out the inevitable. We donâ€™t get paid by the hour, yâ€™know.â€


A gunshot rang out. Somewhere, Mama and Nina screamed. I shouldâ€™ve screamed too, but I didnâ€™t. I could only watch, eyes wide and frozen, legs burning from how long and hard I stood on tiptoes, as a bright red stain blossomed on Papaâ€™s chest. He staggered, his mouth moving but forming no words. Perhaps he wouldâ€™ve survived one shot, but then another gunshot rang out, and another, and another, until Papaâ€™s big, strong body thudded to the ground. It lay there, still and unmoving.


â€œIt,â€ not â€œhe.â€ Because the corpse wasnâ€™t my Papa. It had his face and hair and skin, but Papa was gone. Iâ€™d seen him leave, the light fading from his eyes.


â€œNo!â€ Mama wailed. She crawled toward Papa, but she only made it halfway before her body jerked and her mouth fell open. She, too, collapsed, her blood staining the floors.


â€œDamn, what dâ€™you do that for?â€ the first man complained. â€œI wanted to have some fun with her first.â€


â€œBitch was getting on my nerves. Canâ€™t stand all the wailing, and weâ€™re here for a job, not your dick,â€ the second man growled.


The first man scowled but didnâ€™t argue.


The pair stared at Nina, who cried so hard her face turned bright red and her body shook from the force of her sobs. Smudges hissed at the men, its eyes glowing ferociously in its tiny face. It was a kitten, but in that moment, it had all the trappings of a lion.


â€œToo young,â€ the first man said in disgust.


The second man ignored him. â€œSorry, kiddo,â€ he told Nina. â€œNothing personal. Your bad luck for being born into this family.â€


My blood roared and roared. Liquid dripped down my wrist, and I realized Iâ€™d dug my nails into my palms so hard I was bleeding.

Drip. Drip. Drip.

Each drip sounded like a sonic boom in the dark, cramped space. Could they hear it? Could they hear me, crouched behind the fireplace like a coward while they murdered my family?


I wanted to run out. I wanted to jump on the men and kick and claw. I wanted to bash their heads in with the heavy sculpture on the fireplace mantel and strip the flesh from their bones piece by piece until they begged for death.


It was the first time Iâ€™d had such violent thoughts. Mama was sweet and loving, and Papa was tough but fair. Honorable. They had raised Nina and me to be the same.


But after seeing what those men did, I wanted to torture them slowly. Endlessly.


Except I couldnâ€™t. If I went out there, they would kill me too, and there would be no vengeance. No justice.

Drip. Drip. Dripdripdrip.

I bled faster. I couldnâ€™t look away as the second man raised his gun again and fired.


One shot. That was all it took.


Smudges went berserk. He flew at the men, hissing and clawing. One of them cursed and tried to kick him, but he dodged just in time.


â€œForget about the damn cat,â€ the second man snapped. â€œLetâ€™s finish the job and get outta here.â€


â€œI fucking hate animals,â€ the first man muttered in disgust. â€œHey, didnâ€™t he say there was another kid? Whereâ€™s the little snot?â€


â€œNot here.â€ His partner glanced around, his eyes flickering past the fireplace and settling on the small, fancy jade statue on a side table. â€œAt camp or something.â€


â€œShit, Iâ€™ve never been to camp. You ever been to camp? Iâ€™ve always wantedâ€”â€


â€œShut. Up.â€


They swept through the living room, pilfering the most valuable items and putting their filthy hands all over my family belongings before they finally left and silence fell.


My breath rasped in the quiet. I waited and waited. When I was sure they wouldnâ€™t come back, I pushed open the heavy passageway door, my face reddening from the effort, and stumbled toward the bodies in the living room.


Mama. Papa. Nina.


I should call the police. I also knew I shouldnâ€™t disturb the crime scene, but this was my family. This was the last chance Iâ€™d ever have to hold them.


So I did.


My breathing slowed, my head cleared.


I should feel angry.


I should feel sad.


I should feel
 something.

But I didnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t feel anything at all.

The clawing pressure around my neck tightened. I couldnâ€™t protect them. The people Iâ€™d loved most in the world, and Iâ€™d been useless. Helpless. A coward.
I could take revenge all I wanted, but it wouldnâ€™t change the fact that they were gone and I was here. Me, the most fucked-up one. If there was ever proof that the universe had a sick sense of humor, this was it.
â€œI have to go,â€ my uncle said, smoothing his hand over his tie. â€œIâ€™m meeting an old friend. Are you staying for the weekend?â€
I blinked away my memories and nodded.
â€œExcellent. Weâ€™ll play chess when I get back, hmm?â€
My uncle was the only person who could hold his own against me in chess.
â€œOf course.â€ I rubbed my thumb over the wound on my hand. â€œLooking forward to it.â€



* * *


After my uncle left,
 I spent an hour in the home gym working off my frustrations, but something niggled at me.
Something Ivan said and the way heâ€™d said itâ€¦

Iâ€™m the CEO, so she didnâ€™t have much choice.

Why the hell was my uncle checking in on me, and why did he want to know my schedule so bad heâ€™d threaten Carolina for the information? She was a good assistant, and she wouldnâ€™t divulge the information unless she had to.
I turned off the shower and dried myself, my mind running through the possibilities. I hadnâ€™t gotten this far in life without listening to my instincts, so I got dressed, pulled on a pair of leather gloves, and returned to my uncleâ€™s office. He had hidden security cameras in there, but the top-of-the-line jammer Iâ€™d bought off the black market took care of them in no time.
I wasnâ€™t sure what I was looking for, but after an hour of searchingâ€”including for false drawers and secret compartmentsâ€”I didnâ€™t find it. Same went for his bedroom.
Perhaps I was
 being paranoid.
My stomach growled, reminding me I hadnâ€™t eaten since my coffee and bagel at breakfast. It was now near sunset.
I gave up on my uncleâ€™s private quarters and walked toward the kitchen. Ivan had hired a housekeeper who came by twice a week to clean up, but otherwise, he had no staff; he was too paranoid about corporate spies, whom he claimed could pop up anywhere.

Donâ€™t trust anyone, Alex
 . Itâ€™s always the people you least expect whoâ€™ll stab you in the back.

At the last minute, I veered toward the library, my uncleâ€™s favorite room in the house. The soaring, two-story room looked like something out of an English manor, with its Tiffany stained glass lamps and wall of mahogany shelves groaning beneath the weight of leather-bound tomes. Soft Oriental rugs muffled the sound of my footsteps as I walked around the room, examining the shelves. I hoped whatever I was looking for wasnâ€™t hidden in a fake bookâ€”there were thousands of books in here.
Knowing my uncle, though, he wouldnâ€™t choose any book. Heâ€™d choose something with significance.
I checked the sections for his favorite authors. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Taras Shevchenko, Leo Tolstoy, Alexander Dovzhenkoâ€¦he had a soft spot for Russian and Ukrainian classics. Said they grounded him in his roots.
But no, all the books were real.
My eyes flitted over the rest of the library and landed on the limited-edition chess set in the corner. The pieces were still arranged in the same pattern from our last game.
While I examined the set and the surrounding area for anything that could give credence to my suspicions, I knocked against the table, and a pawn tumbled to the floor.
I cursed under my breath and bent to pick it up. As I did, my eyes snagged on the outlet beneath the table. It was a simple, ordinary outlet, exceptâ€¦
My gaze traveled to the left.
There was another outlet, less than a foot away. The U.S. National Electrical Code stipulated outlets must be positioned no more than six feet apart measured along the floor line, but it was rare to see two so close together.
I paused, listening for any noisesâ€”the purr of my uncleâ€™s Mercedes pulling into the driveway, the thud of his footsteps against the parquet floors.
Nothing.
I fished a heavy-duty paper clip from the libraryâ€™s writing desk and crawled under the chess table, bending the clip until it was straight. I jiggled the screw in the middle of the outlet, feeling ridiculous, but my instincts screamed at me to continue.
Just when I was about to give up, the outlet popped open, revealing a stash of papers in the wall.
Fake outlet. Of course.

My heart thudded as I reached for the papersâ€”right as an engine roared in the distance.
My uncle was home.
I unfolded the documentsâ€”letters, written in two familiar sets of handwriting.
I speed-read them, unable to believe my eyes.
Iâ€™d expected corporate politics. Boardroom foul play. I wouldnâ€™t have been surprised if my uncle tried to hold on to his CEO position, even though I was supposed to take over soon. But this
 ? This, I never saw coming.
The puzzle pieces in my brain clicked into place, and a strange cocktail of betrayal, fury, and relief knotted in my gut. Betrayal and fury over the revelation; relief thatâ€”
The front door banged open. Footsteps, coming closer.
I shoved the letters into the wall, folding them the way Iâ€™d found them, and screwed the outlet cover back on. I crawled out from beneath the table, placed the pawn in the same position itâ€™d been in before I knocked it over, and pocketed both the paper clip and my gloves, which were sleek enough that they didnâ€™t create a visible bulge in my pants.
I plucked The Count of Monte Cristo
 by Alexander Dumasâ€”one of my favorite booksâ€”off the shelf on my way to the door.
â€œAlex,â€ my uncle said when he saw me in the hall. He chuckled. â€œDumas again? You canâ€™t get enough of that book.â€
I smiled. â€œNo, I canâ€™t.â€
All the while, my blood raged.

Ava






He was late.

I tapped my fingers on the table, trying not to check the time on my phone. Again.

Alex and I had agreed to meet at the Italian restaurant near campus at seven. It was now seven-thirty, and all my texts and calls had gone unanswered.
Half an hour wasnâ€™t that
 long, especially when you took rush hour traffic into account, but Alex was never late. And he always, always answered my messages.
Iâ€™d called his office, but his assistant told me heâ€™d left an hour ago, so he should
 be here by now.
Worry unspooled in my stomach and gnawed at my insides.
Had something happened to him? What if heâ€™d gotten into an accident?
It was easy to think of Alex as invincible, but he bled and hurt like anyone else.

Ten more minutes.
 Iâ€™ll give him ten more minutes, and then Iâ€™llâ€¦hell, I donâ€™t know. Send out the freakinâ€™ National Guard. If he was hurt, I wouldnâ€™t sit here and do nothing.
â€œCan I get you anything, dear?â€ The waitress swooped by again. â€œOther than water,â€ she added pointedly.
The tips of my ears turned red. â€œNo, thanks. Iâ€™m, um, still waiting for my friend.â€ That seemed slightly less pathetic than admitting I was waiting for my boyfriend.
Slightly.
She let out an aggrieved sigh and moved on to the older couple next to me.
I felt bad about hogging the table on a Friday night, but Iâ€™d barely seen Alex over the past week, and I missed him. We slept in the same bed every night, and our sex was as explosive as ever, but he seemed more distant during the day. Distracted.
â€œAva?â€
My head jerked up, and my chest deflated when I realized it wasnâ€™t Alex.
â€œRemember me?â€ The guy smiled. He was cute in a geek-chic way, with black-rimmed glasses and longish brown hair. â€œIâ€™m Elliott. We met at Liamâ€™s birthday party last spring.â€
â€œAh, right.â€ I suppressed a flinch at the sound of Liamâ€™s name. I hadnâ€™t seen or heard from him since the charity ball, but Julesâ€”ever tuned in to the gossipâ€”informed me heâ€™d gotten fired and had moved back to his parentsâ€™ house in Virginia. I couldnâ€™t say I felt sorry for him. â€œNice to see you again.â€
â€œYou, too.â€ Elliott ran an awkward hand through his hair. â€œHey, sorry about what happened with Liam. We havenâ€™t kept in touch since we graduated, but I heard about your breakup and, uhâ€¦what happened. He was a real jerk.â€
â€œThanks.â€ I couldnâ€™t blame him for being Liamâ€™s friend. Ex-friend?
 I was the one whoâ€™d dated the asshole, and guys usually treated their friends better than they did their girlfriends. It was a sad truth.
â€œSorry to bother you during dinnerâ€”â€ His gaze flicked to my water glass. â€œBut Iâ€™m looking for a photographer who can do an engagement shoot for me, and none of the ones I checked out fit what Sally, my fiancÃ©e, is looking for. But I saw you and remembered youâ€™re a photographer, so I figured itâ€™s a sign.â€ Elliott flashed a sheepish smile. â€œHope this doesnâ€™t sound creepy, but I pulled up your website and showed it to Sally, and she loves
 your pictures. If youâ€™re free in the next few weeks, weâ€™d love to hire you.â€
I spotted a pretty blonde at a neighboring table watching us. She grinned and waved at me. I waved back.
â€œCongrats,â€ I said, my smile genuine this time. â€œIâ€™d love to help. Give me your number, and we can sort out details later.â€
While we exchanged contact information, an icy voice sliced through the din of the restaurant.
â€œYouâ€™re in my way.â€
Alex stood behind Elliott, pinning him with a glare so dark I was surprised the poor man didnâ€™t disintegrate into ashes.
â€œOh, sorryâ€”â€
â€œWhy are you getting my girlfriendâ€™s number?â€
Elliott shot me a nervous glance, and I clenched my jaw. Seriously?
 Alex was almost an hour late, and he had the nerve to act like a jealous ass the minute he showed up?
â€œHeâ€™s a client,â€ I said, struggling to remain calm. â€œElliott, Iâ€™ll call you later, okay? Congratulations again on your engagement
 .â€ I emphasized the last word. Alexâ€™s frown eased a smidge, but he didnâ€™t fully relax until Elliott ran back to his table.
â€œWhat the hell was that?â€ I demanded.
â€œWhat was what?â€ Alex slid into his seat.
â€œYouâ€™re late, and you were rude to Elliott for no reason.â€
He snapped his napkin open and placed it in his lap. â€œI had urgent business to take care of, and my phone died, so I couldnâ€™t call you. As for Elliott
 , I showed up and saw some random guy flirting with my girlfriend. How did you expect me to react?â€
â€œHe. Wasnâ€™t. Flirting. With. Me.â€ I exhaled a long breath. This wasnâ€™t how Iâ€™d pictured the evening going. â€œLook, I donâ€™t want to fight. This is the first time weâ€™ve had a meal together in over a week, and I want to enjoy it.â€
â€œMe too.â€ Alexâ€™s face softened. â€œIâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m late. Iâ€™ll make it up to you.â€
â€œYou better.â€
His lips quirked.
We placed our orders, the waitress looking much happier after Alex ordered the most expensive white wine on the menu. I couldnâ€™t drink red or my face would explode. I blame my Asian genesâ€”one sip of alcohol, especially red wine, and I turn the color of a tomato.
I waited until the server brought out our entrees before I revealed my big news. â€œI heard back from the photography fellowship today.â€
Alexâ€™s fork paused halfway to his mouth.
â€œI got in.â€ I bit my lower lip, my chest wild with the drumbeat of excitement and nerves. â€œNew York. I got in.â€
â€œI knew you would.â€ Simple and matter of fact, like heâ€™d never doubted me, but Alexâ€™s eyes shone with pride. â€œCongratulations, Sunshine.â€
He leaned across the table and pressed a kiss to my lips. I was so giddy I couldnâ€™t stop grinning, and my earlier irritation melted away. So what if heâ€™d been a little late? I got in!

Iâ€™d nearly dropped my phone when I received the email this morning. Iâ€™d had to reread it several times before the words sunk in.
I, Ava Chen, was going to be a World Youth Photography fellow. I would spend a year in New York, studying with the worldâ€™s best photographers. My only regret was not being able to study under Diane Lange, who taught the London cohort, because while Iâ€™d made progress with my aquaphobia, I wasnâ€™t ready to fly over an ocean yet.
But that was okay. Iâ€™d meet her one day. In the meantime, Iâ€™d work on honing my craft and holy crap, I was going to be a WYP fellow!
 One of the most prestigious honors in the industry.
My heart soared before reality dragged me down.
â€œIâ€™ll be in New York,â€ I said after Alex and I broke apart. â€œYouâ€™ll be in D.C.â€
â€œNo, I wonâ€™t.â€ His eyes gleamed at my questioning look. â€œArcher Group has an office in Manhattan.â€
My hopeful heart flapped its wings again. â€œBut youâ€™ve built your base here. Your house, your friendsâ€¦â€
â€œItâ€™s not my house; itâ€™s Joshâ€™s. Iâ€™m safekeeping it for him. And most of the people I know here are acquaintances, not friends.â€ Alex lifted his shoulder in an elegant shrug. â€œItâ€™s a simple equation, Sunshine. If youâ€™re in New York, Iâ€™m in New York.â€
The last vestiges of my hesitation floated away. I grinned, so happy I could dance right here in the middle of a crowded restaurant. â€œYou know howâ€”â€
Something buzzed. Alex stiffened, and my eyes dropped to his coat pocket, which buzzed again.
My grin faded. â€œYou said your phone died.â€
Just like that, the tension returned, simmering in the air until it became a full-on boil.
The night was an emotional rollercoaster, and I couldnâ€™t keep up.
â€œI charged it in the car.â€ Alex sipped his wine, his shoulders tense.
â€œBut you didnâ€™t reply to any of my messages or calls.â€ I tucked my hands beneath my thighs, suddenly cold even though the heat was on. â€œWhy were you really late, Alex?â€
â€œI told you, I had urgent business to take care of.â€
â€œThatâ€™s not good enough.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know what you want me to tell you.â€
â€œThe truth!
 â€ I lowered my voice when the diners at the next table shot me an alarmed look. â€œThatâ€™s all I want. Please. My fathâ€”Michael lied to me my entire life, and I donâ€™t want you to start.â€
A shadow passed over Alexâ€™s face before it disappeared. â€œI wonâ€™t lie unless the truth hurts you.â€
My teeth clenched. â€œAlexâ€”â€
â€œPlausible deniability exists for a reason, Sunshine.â€ He cut into his pasta with more force than necessary.
â€œWhat did you do?â€ I whispered.
Alex tightened his grip on his fork. â€œIâ€™m not always a good person. I donâ€™t always do the right thing. You know that, even if you seem determined to see the good in me. I wonâ€™tâ€”â€ He released a pent-up breath, looking frustrated. â€œJust drop it, Ava. For your own sake.â€
â€œSure. Iâ€™ll drop it.â€ I tossed my napkin on the table, my own frustration boiling over. â€œIâ€™m also leaving. Iâ€™ve lost my appetite.â€
â€œSunshineâ€”â€ He reached for me, but I shrugged him off and ran out before he could stop me.
My chest felt tight as I speed-walked home. What shouldâ€™ve been one of the best nights of my life had turned into one of the worst.










33













Alex






I paid
 and left the restaurant immediately after Ava. She hadnâ€™t gotten far, and I followed discreetly to make sure she got home safe before I drove back to D.C.
I hated seeing her upset, especially on a night when we shouldâ€™ve been celebrating instead of fighting. I wanted to run after her and apologize for being an ass, but the clock was ticking, and I needed to finish what Iâ€™d started.
Only then could I put the past behind me, once and for all.
I stared at my computer screen, watching the minutes tick by. 11:55 p.m
 . Iâ€™d given the man a midnight deadline.

11:56 p.m.

I hadnâ€™t
 told Ava the truthâ€¦about many things. I didnâ€™t have urgent business to take care of before dinner, at least none relevant to Archer Group. Instead, Iâ€™d been talking to my familyâ€™s killersâ€™ killer.
The police had ruled my parentsâ€™ and sisterâ€™s murders as a home invasion gone wrong, but I knew better. The men had said it was a job and mentioned a â€œhe,â€ someone who knew I was supposed to be at camp that summer, though that was something anyone with internet access and a bare modicum of computer skills could figure outâ€”the camp posted a list of its attendees online every year.
Iâ€™d kept the knowledge of their true motives to myself though. Iâ€™d been young, but old enough to know the criminal justice system wouldnâ€™t deliver the type of justice I craved: total annihilation.
So Iâ€™d waited.

11:57 p.m.

My uncle was the only person Iâ€™d told. He, too, hadnâ€™t believed it was a simple invasion.
But the police caught the culprits a few days later thanks to street security footage that IDâ€™ed their license plate, and theyâ€™d confirmed it was a home invasion. The â€œburglarsâ€ said they hadnâ€™t wanted to leave witnesses, so theyâ€™d killed everyone. They also hadnâ€™t made it to trial before they â€œmysteriouslyâ€ died in jail.
My uncle did some digging and found the man whoâ€™d hired the killersâ€™ killer. Apparently, he was one of my fatherâ€™s business rivals and had a history of shady dealings and ruthless practices. By logic, he had to have been the one whoâ€™d ordered the hit on my family too.
Iâ€™d spent every second of my life since plotting his downfall.

11:58 p.m.

Iâ€™d been a kid, and Iâ€™d trusted my uncle, but what Iâ€™d read in the library threw everything I knew about him out the window.
Ava was rightâ€”Iâ€™d been distracted this past week, busy with my chess game. Not the unfinished one with my uncle in the library, but the one playing out in real life.
Iâ€™d had my tech guy hack into Ivanâ€™s financial records dating back to my familyâ€™s deaths and paid him a hefty sum to work day and night until he found what Iâ€™d expected to find all along. A large sum of money had been wired from one of my uncleâ€™s secret offshore accounts to an anonymous account two days before my familyâ€™s death, and another equal sum had been sent the day after. An even larger amount had been sent to a second anonymous account the day after the â€œburglarsâ€ died.
Iâ€™d paid the hacker another eye-watering sum to track down the second killer. Heâ€™d contacted me when I was on my way to meet Ava, saying heâ€™d located the person, a notorious killer for hire who went by the name of Falcon. Theyâ€™d apparently retired, but I didnâ€™t need their â€œskills.â€ I only needed a name.
As a gesture of goodwill, Iâ€™d wired Falcon twenty-five percent of the fifty grand Iâ€™d promised them if they would confirm who hired them to kill the burglars.
Now, I waited.

11:59 p.m.

I stared at the blank black screen of Vortex, a fully encrypted messaging site popular amongst those in the criminal underworld. Unhackable and untraceable, it was where most of the worldâ€™s seediest transactions took place.
A chill whipped around me.
I hadnâ€™t bothered to turn the heater on. Iâ€™d bought this house in D.C. under a shell company name because I wanted a place where I could carry out my more illicit activities without anyone knowing, not even my uncle. It boasted a security system the Pentagon would be jealous of, including a hidden jammer that disabled all electronic devices inside the house unless you had the code, which only I knew.

12:00 a.m.

A new message flashed onscreen.
Midnight on the dot. Gotta appreciate a punctual killer.
I read the message calmly, my blood colder than the chill creeping along the floorboards and bare walls.
No greeting, no questions. Just a name, like Iâ€™d requested.
I wired the rest of the money to the Falcon and sat there in the dark, mulling over the news.
I knew. Of course I knew. All the evidence had pointed to it, but now I had my confirmation.
The man responsible for my familyâ€™s death wasnâ€™t Michael Chen, Avaâ€™s father.
It was Ivan Volkov, my uncle.

I made pancakes.

I rarely cookedâ€”why waste my time doing something I didnâ€™t enjoy and which I could pay other people to do? But I made an exception today. I was waiting for a visitor, and I didnâ€™t want to miss them by eating out.
The doorbell rang.
9:07 a.m., according to the clock on my microwave. Earlier than Iâ€™d expected, which meant he was eager.
I shut off the stove and sipped my tea as I answered the door. When I did, I had to mask my surprise.

Not who I was expecting.

â€œWhat are you doing here, Sunshine?â€
Not the warmest greeting, but she needed to leave before he arrived.
Mild panic shot through me at the thought of them meeting.
Ava frowned. She looked exhausted, and I wondered if she was having nightmares again. Theyâ€™d eased since she recovered her memories, but they still popped up from time to time.
Worry and guilt washed over me. We hadnâ€™t spoken in days. She was still angry with me, and Iâ€™d been caught up in my plans. It was hard to convene a corporate board the week before Christmasâ€”in secret, no lessâ€”but I held enough blackmail info over every member that theyâ€™d acquiesced to my request.
â€œWe need to talk. About us,â€ Ava said.
Not words any man wants to hear come out of his girlfriendâ€™s mouth, especially when he and said girlfriend were on rocky ground. I couldnâ€™t wait until this mess with my uncle was over so I could give her the attention she deserved.
As for my twisted and apparently ill-placed revenge plan against her â€œfatherâ€â€¦that was a confession for another day.
If I ever confessed.
Michael Chen was a sociopathic bastard even if he hadnâ€™t plotted my familyâ€™s murder, and I was tempted to follow through with my original plan to hire someone to off him in prison. But I wouldnâ€™tâ€¦yet.
â€œCan we talk later?â€ A familiar gray Mercedes came into view, and my muscles tensed. â€œNow isnâ€™t a good time.â€
Ava shook her head. â€œItâ€™s been a week, Christmas is in two days, and Iâ€™m tired of us tiptoeing around each other. Youâ€™ve been acting weird for a while now, and I deserve to know whatâ€™s going on. If you donâ€™t want to be with me any longerâ€”â€ She exhaled a sharp breath, her face tinting red. â€œJust tell me. Donâ€™t string me along.â€

Goddamn it.
 If only Josh had come home for Christmas like heâ€™d planned, he wouldâ€™ve kept Ava away. But thereâ€™d been an earthquake in his volunteer regionâ€”he was okay, thank Godâ€”and the people needed all the medical help they could get in the aftermath, so heâ€™d stayed. Iâ€™d donated a hefty sum to help with his organizationâ€™s expenses as well. Partly out of charity, mostly out of guilt.
Ava wasnâ€™t the only Chen Iâ€™d fucked over these past few years.
My uncle parked and got out of his car, his face thunderous.
My grip tightened around my mug.
â€œOf course I want to be with you,â€ I said in a low voice while keeping an eye on Ivan. â€œIâ€™ll always want to be with you. But Iâ€”â€
â€œAlex.â€ My uncleâ€™s pleasant tone belied the fury simmering in his eyes. When Ava turned, startled, he smoothed his face into a gracious smile. â€œWhoâ€™s this lovely creature?â€
If the mug were glass, it wouldâ€™ve cracked by now.
â€œAva, Uncle Ivan,â€ I responded, voice clipped.
â€œAh, the infamous Ava. How lovely to meet you, dear.â€
She smiled, looking uncomfortable. â€œI didnâ€™t realize you were expecting company,â€ she told me. â€œUm, youâ€™re right. We can talk laterâ€”â€
â€œNonsense. Iâ€™m just here for a friendly chat with my nephew.â€ Ivan placed a hand on Avaâ€™s back and guided her into the house. Get your fucking hands off her.
 Anger streaked through me, but I tamped it down.
I couldnâ€™t lose my cool. Not now.
We settled in the dining roomâ€”Ava and I on one side, Ivan on the other. Tension laced the air.
â€œAnyone want a drink?â€ I set my near-empty mug on the table. â€œTea? Hot chocolate?â€
Ava shook her head. â€œNo, thanks.â€
â€œGreen tea for me.â€ Ivan patted his stomach. I returned a few minutes later with his drink and found him in deep conversation with Ava.
â€œâ€¦Thanksgiving weekend?â€ My uncle took the tea from me with an oily smile. â€œAlex, Ava was telling me about how you spent your Thanksgiving. He loves his holidays with the Chens,â€ he told her. â€œHe finds them soâ€¦enlightening.â€
My muscles burned from how tense I was while Ava returned his smile with her own uncertain one.
â€œWhat can I do for you, uncle?â€ I asked, taking my seat with careful nonchalance. â€œIt must be important if youâ€™re here this early. Long drive from Philly.â€
â€œI wanted to congratulate my favorite nephew.â€ Ivanâ€™s smile tightened. I didnâ€™t bother pointing out I was his only
 nephew. â€œAva, dear, did you know youâ€™re sitting next to the new CEO of Archer Group?â€
I betrayed no emotion while Avaâ€™s head whipped toward me, her eyes wide.
â€œMy uncle graciously stepped aside,â€ I said. I addressed Ivan. â€œIâ€™m grateful for your tutelage and all the years youâ€™ve dedicated to the company, but now you can retire and indulge in fishing, crossword puzzles, TV dramasâ€¦a life of leisure, just like you deserve.â€
â€œYes,â€ he said coldly. â€œIâ€™m looking forward to it.â€
It was all bullshit, this show we were putting on. My uncle didnâ€™t resign, though that would be the official story we fed to the press. Heâ€™d toppled from power thanks to the secret boardroom coup Iâ€™d spent the past week executing. Iâ€™d had to use more dirty tricks than usual to get it done in such a short time, but anger is the worldâ€™s greatest motivator.
I was now CEO of Archer Group, and Ivan was nothing. After I finished with him, he wouldnâ€™t have
 anything, either.
â€œCongratulations. Thatâ€™s amazing.â€ Ava looked genuinely happy for me, but she also sounded confused and a little hurt, probably because I hadnâ€™t mentioned something so huge to her. Then again, the changeover hadnâ€™t been official until yesterday afternoon. No doubt the board notified Ivan, and heâ€™d driven here first thing in the morning, intent on reaming me out.
He didnâ€™t take his eyes off me as he said, â€œYou and Ava should visit one day. Iâ€™m an old man who doesnâ€™t have many friends, and I donâ€™t like to leave the house much.â€ He chuckled. â€œIâ€™m a bit paranoid about security, you see. I have cameras all over my homeâ€”my office, the kitchenâ€¦the library. I rarely go through all the tapes, butâ€”â€ He sipped his tea. â€œWhatâ€™s a man with too much free time to do?â€
I read between the lines in an instant.

Fuck.
 How had I missed the cameras in the library? Iâ€™d jammed the ones in his bedroom and office and adjusted them afterward so they didnâ€™t show any suspicious missing time periods, but my uncle had never had cameras in the other rooms before. He mustâ€™ve checked the feeds to see what Iâ€™d been up to after he received word of the coup.
Heâ€™d grown more paranoidâ€”and Iâ€™d grown more lax.
I wouldnâ€™t make that mistake again.
Ivan and I stared at each other. The jig was up. He knew Iâ€™d seen the letters between him and my motherâ€”the ones where heâ€™d professed his love and begged her to leave my father, the ones where sheâ€™d rebuffed him until he grew more and more aggressive and she had to threaten him with a restraining orderâ€¦the ones where he promised she would regret spurning him.
Once I had that piece of information, the rest of the puzzle fell into placeâ€”why my father and Ivan fell out, how the burglars knew so much about our family, why my uncle sometimes got a weird look on his face when we talked about my parents.. Iâ€™d known all along how narcissistic my uncle could be, and my motherâ€™s rejection mustâ€™ve hit hardâ€”hard enough that heâ€™d plot his own brotherâ€™s death.
That didnâ€™t explain why he chose Michael Chen as the scapegoat, but Iâ€™d figure it out. I wouldnâ€™t stop until Iâ€™d peeled back every layer of Ivanâ€™s deception and strangled him with them.
I now understood how Ava felt. Iâ€™d been lied to most of my life too, only my reaction was far less benign than hers.
â€œUm, sure.â€ Ava glanced at me. â€œWeâ€™ll visit someday.â€

Yes. Over my dead body. Or, to be more accurate, my uncleâ€™s dead body.

â€œExcellent.â€ Ivan set his empty mug on the table. â€œWell, I think Iâ€™ve overstayed my welcome. Iâ€™ll leave you kids alone. Alex, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll talk soon.â€
â€œIâ€™m sure we will,â€ I drawled.
After he left, Ava and I sat in silence, eyeing each other warily. I wanted to pull her to me, kiss her and reassure her, but everything had gotten so fucking complicated. Not to mention, she still didnâ€™t know the truth about me and what I did.

She wonâ€™t find out.
 The only other person who knew was my uncle, and he would be out of the picture soon.
A better person would tell her the truth, but Iâ€™d rather be the villain with her by my side than the hero who risked losing her because of a misguided sense of morality.

What she doesnâ€™t know wonâ€™t hurt her.

â€œYour uncle is not what I expected,â€ she finally said. â€œHeâ€™s veryâ€¦slick.â€
That pulled a small smile out of me. She didnâ€™t like him, either. Atta girl.

â€œWhy didnâ€™t you tell me about your promotion?â€ she asked. â€œThatâ€™s huge news! We shouldâ€™ve celebrated or something.â€
â€œIt wasnâ€™t official until yesterday. Thought Iâ€™d announce it as a Christmas surprise.â€ That was partly true.
Ava sighed, her expression growing sad. â€œI miss you, Alex.â€
God, this girl. She had no clue what she did to me. â€œI miss you too, Sunshine.â€ I opened my arms, and she climbed into my lap, wrapping her arms around my neck. I breathed in her scent, my heart aching. I wanted to keep her here, safe and cherished, forever. Fuck the rest of the world. It could burn for all I cared.
â€œI donâ€™t want to fight, butâ€¦â€ Her bottom lip disappeared between her teeth. â€œYou have
 been acting strange lately. If something is wrong, you know you can tell me and weâ€™ll figure it out together, right?â€
â€œI know.â€ How was she so amazing? Anyone whoâ€™d gone through what she had wouldâ€™ve locked themselves away from the rest of the world by now, but not Ava. She was always thinking of others.
I didnâ€™t deserve her.
â€œIs it because I told you Iâ€”â€ She paused, pink blossoming on her cheeks. â€œI loved you?â€
â€œOf course not.â€ I tightened my hold and kissed her. â€œYou know Iâ€™d do anything for you.â€
â€œOkay, because you started acting weird right afterâ€¦â€
â€œItâ€™s work,â€ I lied. â€œIâ€™ve been stressed about the CEO transition.â€ Also partly true.
It was a testament to Avaâ€™s trust that she took my words at face value. â€œYouâ€™ll be a great CEO.â€ She brushed her lips over a sensitive spot on my neck, and my cock jumped with interest. I hadnâ€™t touched her in a week, and I was dying to tie her down and have my way with her. â€œNow, how about we alleviate that stressâ€¦â€
I responded with a wicked grin. â€œI like the way you think.â€
But as I carried her upstairs and fucked her in every position until she couldnâ€™t scream anymore, the sense of impending doom hovering over me remained.

Alex






My world crashed
 down two weeks after my uncleâ€™s visit.
I was driving to work when I received a call from Ivan â€œrequestingâ€ I visit him ASAP. Heâ€™d been suspiciously quiet since he was dethroned as CEO, but I knew why. I also knew why heâ€™d asked for a visitâ€”Iâ€™d been expecting it.
I called my assistant and told her to cancel the rest of my meetings for the day and made it to Philadelphia in two hours flat.
I slowed my steps as I walked up the stairs to my uncleâ€™s office, sure he had cameras monitoring my every move since I pulled up to the estateâ€™s gates.
I found him sitting behind his desk, watching his beloved Russian drama on the TV.
â€œHello, uncle.â€ I leaned against the wall and stuffed my hands in my pockets, the picture of casual indifference.
Ivanâ€™s eye twitched. â€œSo you finally made it, you little shit.â€
I suppressed a smile. My uncle rarely cursed; he must have been out of his mind with anger. I could see why; he looked horrible. I spotted a bald spot in his hair, as well as scaly red patches and a few nasty-looking pustular eruptions on his skin. His face looked haggard, his complexion wan.
For someone as vain as my uncle, the deterioration of his looks must be a living nightmare.
â€œIâ€™ll always make time to visit my favorite uncle.â€ My only
 uncle, though not for much longer. â€œYou donâ€™t look so well. Stressed over losing your job?â€
A muscle ticked in his jaw. â€œYouâ€™re handing the CEO position back to me.â€
I almost laughed out loud. â€œWhy would I do that?â€
â€œBecause.â€ Ivan leaned back and laced his hands over his stomach. â€œI have something you want, and I have a feeling youâ€™ll do anything to get it backâ€”including resigning from Archer Group, reinstating me as CEO, and wiring me fifty million dollars. For the emotional distress,â€ he explained.
His mental facilities must be deteriorating faster than his physical appearance if he thought I would do any
 of those things.
â€œSure you do,â€ I said indulgently. â€œLetâ€™s see what this magical â€˜somethingâ€™ is first.â€
â€œDid I say â€˜somethingâ€™?â€ Ivanâ€™s eyes glowed with malice. â€œI meant â€˜someone.â€™ Bring them in.â€ He barked the last statement in Russian.
There was a scuffle outside the door, and my blood ran cold when a massive man in camo pants and dog tags entered, dragging two bound and gagged girls behind him.
Ava and Bridget.
They stared at me, fear stamped on every inch of their faces.
It took every ounce of willpower not to display a visible reaction.
â€œI see,â€ I said in a bored voice. â€œSorry, Uncle, but I donâ€™t see anythingâ€”or anyoneâ€”that would make me consider giving you dogshit, much less fifty million dollars.â€
A small cut marred Avaâ€™s face. Tears stained her cheeks, and she stared at me with wide eyes, her distress evident. Bruises marked her arms from where Camo grabbed her, and I glimpsed red, chafed skin from where the rope dug into her wrists.
Ava. Hurt.
Wild, all-consuming anger erupted in my stomach until it filled every inch of my being.
I stared at Camo, and he stared back, smugness oozing from his ugly mug.

Not for much longer.

He was going to die today. Slowly. Painfully.
I was pleased to note he had several cuts and bruises of his own. Ava and Bridget had clearly put up a fight, but that didnâ€™t matter.
Heâ€™d dared touch what was mine, and for that, Iâ€™d make him beg for something as sweet as death.
The guard Iâ€™d hired to look after Ava in case my uncle pulled shit like this? He would die too for failing at his job.
Beside Ava, Bridget shifted, her face pale. The small movement prompted Camo to yank her arm in warning, but to her credit, she didnâ€™t flinch. Instead, she glared at him, her gaze flinty.
The regal princess, even when kidnapped.
Speaking of which, where the fuck was her
 bodyguard? Rhys was an ex-Navy SEAL. He should be more competent than the apparent moron Iâ€™d hired.
I didnâ€™t have time to dwell on that question. I shifted my attention back to my uncle, who wore a knowing smirk.
â€œYou canâ€™t fool me, Alex,â€ he said, his voice thin and reedy. â€œI saw the way you looked at her. Sheâ€™s the reason you pulled your punches with the revenge plan. You love her. But will she love you after she finds out what you did?â€
A thick pressure circled my neck, squeezing. My breath quickened.
I knew what my uncle was doing. He was forcing me to confessâ€”the biggest lie Iâ€™d ever told, the worst thing Iâ€™d ever done. He wanted Ava to hate me.
And the worst part was, I had to do it. I would give her up if it meant saving her.
â€œThatâ€™s where youâ€™re wrong,â€ I drawled, keeping my gaze locked on Ivanâ€™s. â€œYou underestimate me, uncle. She was never more than a pawn in my game. Why do you think I pulled back after her father went to jail? She was useless to me after that. I admit, the sex was good.â€ I shrugged. â€œThat was the only reason I didnâ€™t cut her off entirely.â€
I saw Avaâ€™s head jerk up out of the corner of my eye.
â€œSorry, Sunshine.â€ I forced myself to inject a mocking lilt into her nickname. â€œThe catâ€™s out of the bag, so I might as well tell you the whole story. The man I told you about, the one who murdered my parents? That was your fatherâ€”well, fake father. Michael Chen.â€
Avaâ€™s eyes popped, and Bridget finally stirred, her sharp intake of breath audible even through her gag.
â€œI always knew.â€ I pushed off the wall and walked toward her. Camo tensed and stepped in my direction, but Ivan waved him off with a delighted smile. He was enjoying this, that bastard. â€œYou think it was a coincidence that Josh and I were assigned to the same room our freshman year? A hefty bribe with the right person goes far, and thereâ€™s no better way to destroy your enemy than from the inside. I played the â€˜dead parentsâ€™ card to gain his sympathy until he invited me over for the holidays, and while everyone was asleep, I snooped. I bugged your house, went through your fatherâ€™s filesâ€¦found lots of interesting information. Why do you think his business took so many hits over the years?â€
A tear rolled down Avaâ€™s cheek, but I kept going. Iâ€™m sorry, Sunshine.

â€œI dismantled his empire, piece by piece, and you and Josh had no clue.â€ I uttered a soft laugh even as my chest burned. â€œThis year was going to be the grand finale. The year in which my plan to take down his company publicly and humiliatingly came together. But I needed one more piece of information, one more excuse to search through his office. Then Joshâ€”my ticket into your house every Thanksgivingâ€”announced he was volunteering in Central America. Most inconvenient. I needed another in.â€ I cupped her face with one hand, knowing this might be the last time I touched her. â€œThatâ€™s where you enter the picture. Josh did most of the heavy lifting himself when he asked me to look after you, but I planted the idea of moving into his house. After all.â€ I smiled, my heart slowly shredding itself apart. â€œItâ€™s much easier to make you fall in love with me when you have to see me every day. And you did. It was so easy it was almost embarrassing. Sweet, trusting Ava, so eager to fix broken things. So desperate for love sheâ€™d take it anywhere she could find it.â€
She shook her head, her chest heaving. Sheâ€™d stopped crying, but her eyes burned with anger and betrayal. Thatâ€™s my girl. Hate me. Donâ€™t cry over me. Never cry over me. Iâ€™m not worth it.


â€œ
 That night after Thanksgiving dinner? I found the information I was looking for,â€ I said. â€œYour father got desperate over the years as his business crumbled, and he made a few bad deals with bad people. I had it all lined upâ€¦the FBI bust, the media circus.â€ I left out the part where Iâ€™d planned to have Michael killed in prison. The jury was still out on whether Iâ€™d pull that plug. â€œBut imagine my surprise when you regained your memories. It was like an early Christmas surprise. If I couldnâ€™t nail him on the corporate stuff, I could nail him on attempted murder. And it worked. Exceptâ€¦â€ I turned back to my uncle, whose eyes gleamed with malice. â€œI was wrong. It was never Michael. Was it, uncle?â€
Ivanâ€™s lips stretched into a thin grin. He bore no resemblance to the man whoâ€™d brought me into his house and treated me like his sonâ€”or so I thought. It took years to build a relationship and a second to destroy one, and ours had been ruined beyond repair.

Donâ€™t trust anyone, Alex
 . Itâ€™s always the people you least expect whoâ€™ll stab you in the back.

â€œThatâ€™s the beauty of it,â€ he said, even as he winced. I reveled in the pleasure of that small movementâ€”itâ€™d been two weeks; he must be in serious pain by nowâ€”even as my heart tore itself apart at the way Ava looked like at me. Like she didnâ€™t know me at all.
In some ways, she didnâ€™t.
â€œMichael was
 one of your fatherâ€™s business rivals when Anton started expanding into Maryland. Theyâ€™d never gotten alongâ€”Anton hated the way Michael conducted business, and Michael hated that anyone dared encroach on â€˜hisâ€™ territory. They eventually reached a truce, but Michael made an easy scapegoat. It didnâ€™t take much to plant â€˜evidenceâ€™ that an impressionable teen like yourself would believe.â€ Ivan coughed. â€œYouâ€™re a smart kid, but your desire for vengeance blinded you. I always hated the man, anyway. He humiliated me once at a party your father invited him to as a â€˜gesture of goodwillâ€™â€”even though I told Anton not toâ€”and I wasnâ€™t surprised to learn Michaelâ€™s a psychopath as well.â€
â€œYouâ€™re one to talk,â€ I said coldly. My uncle would
 be deranged enough to hold on to a grudge over some slight at a party that happened decades ago.
Iâ€™d gone to painstaking lengths to ensure Michael wouldnâ€™t know of Ivanâ€™s nor my connection with my father, because he wouldnâ€™t exactly welcome the son of the man heâ€™d murdered (or so I thought) into his home. Iâ€™d changed our last names and erased any evidence that would tie us to Anton Dudik. My uncle and I had been born Ivan and Alex Dudik; we were now Ivan and Alex Volkov. I was lucky my uncle was so paranoidâ€”there were few public photos or traces of him before we started Archer Group, which made my job easier.
Apparently, that had all been for naught, since Michael had already met Ivan and knew of his connection to my father. He hadnâ€™t liked me, but he also hadnâ€™t cared about having me in his house, because he wasnâ€™t the murderer.
I couldnâ€™t believe my uncle pulled the wool over my eyes for so long. I was supposed to be a genius. A master strategist. But Iâ€™d fallen prey to the same failing as all other humansâ€”believing the best of someone simply because they were there for you at your worst. He was my only living relative left, and Iâ€™d let that color my perception of him.
Now, because of my fuckup, Ava was hurt.
My stomach clenched. I kept my gaze averted from herâ€”if I looked at her, I would lose it, and I couldnâ€™t afford to lose it. Not with Camo pointing a gun at her and my uncleâ€™s sharp eyes watching everything. He may be dying, but I wouldnâ€™t underestimate him until he was six feet in the ground.
â€œI can say the same for you.â€ Ivan winced again, though he tried to hide it. I hoped the bastard suffered until his last breath on earth. â€œYou, me, Michael. Weâ€™re all cut from the same dark cloth. Weâ€™re willing to do whatever it takes to achieve what we want. I knew it was smart taking you in,â€ he said. â€œYou were so grateful, and I couldnâ€™t let that intellect of yours go to waste. Weâ€™ve done well for ourselves, havenâ€™t we?â€ He swept an arm around his grand office.
â€œI
 did well. You leeched off me like the parasite you are.â€
Ivan clucked in disappointment. â€œIs that any way to speak to the man who kept you from being put into the horrid
 foster system? Really, you should be more grateful.â€
He really was deranged. â€œNo wonder my mom wanted nothing to do with you,â€ I said. â€œShe mustâ€™ve smelled the crazy from a mile away.â€
Ivanâ€™s fake smile melted, and his face twitched with anger. â€œYour mother was a stupid whore,â€ he spat. â€œI loved her, but she turned me downâ€”me,
 the one whoâ€™d been there for her long before she met your fatherâ€”for naÃ¯ve, soft-hearted Anton. I waited and waited for her to come to her senses, but she never did.â€ He snorted. â€œWhen she told Anton about my letters, he stopped speaking to me. Wasnâ€™t man enough to confront me face to face, but he ran his mouth to our mutual friends, all of whom cut me off too.â€ His eyes shone with hatred. â€œNo one
 crosses me like that. He took what I loved from me, so I took what he loved from him.â€
â€œNot what. Who,â€ I said through gritted teeth. â€œMy mother was not an object.â€
Ivan cackled. â€œOh, Alex, love did
 make you soft after all.â€
I clenched my jaw. â€œIâ€™m not in love.â€
â€œThatâ€™s not what a little birdie told me.â€ A cough rattled in his lungs. â€œI had some interesting conversations with a pretty little blonde by the name of Madeline. She had a lot to say about how you reacted when she pushed poor Ava into a pool.â€
Fury sliced through me. Madeline.
 I didnâ€™t know how she and my uncle met, but Ivan mustâ€™ve been tracking me longer than I thought.
Once again, I cursed myself for letting my guard slip.
By this time next month, Hauss Industries would be toast. Iâ€™d make sure of it. Iâ€™d already gathered the kindling after the pool incident; I just needed to set it on fire.
â€œAll you have to do is give me the money and position, sign a contract saying youâ€™ll never come after me or hold corporate office again, and Iâ€™ll let Ava and her little friend go,â€ Ivan said. â€œItâ€™s a simple trade.â€
I wondered if he knew Bridget was the Princess of Eldorra. If he did, he was an idiot for dragging her into this. If he didnâ€™t, he was an idiot for not doing his research.
And if he thought Iâ€™d believe he would let any of us go after he all but admitted to murder in front of us, he must think I
 was an idiot.
I weighed my options. Ivan wouldnâ€™t do anything to me, Ava, or Bridget until Iâ€™d wired the money and given him back his position, but that wouldnâ€™t take long. He knew I had the board under my thumb. I could make him CEO again with one call.
â€œTo be clear, that wasnâ€™t a request,â€ Ivan said.
I smiled, the gears in my brain clicking into place. â€œSure. I can agree to your requestâ€”â€ My uncle smirked. â€œâ€”or I can save your life. You choose.â€
The smirk disappeared. â€œWhat the hell are you talking about?â€
I stepped toward him. Camo raised his gun in warning, but Ivan waved him off, his rheumy eyes narrowing as I stared pointedly at his skin, his hair, and the way his hand shook with barely concealed pain.
Realization dawned. â€œHow?â€ he growled.
My smile slashed across my face. â€œYou were quite thirsty after your drive to my house a few weeks ago.â€
â€œThe tea.â€ Ivanâ€™s face pinched. â€œI checked after the symptoms started showing. The doctors saidâ€”â€
â€œThat you had Guillain-Barre disease?â€ I sighed. â€œIt is unfortunate that the symptoms are so similar. But no, Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s not Guillain-Barre.â€
â€œWhat did you do, you little shit?â€
A flash of movement behind Camoâ€”visible only from where I stoodâ€”caught my eye. I showed no reaction even as my mental calculations adjusted to account for the new development.
â€œYou can buy anything on the black market these days,â€ I said, playing idly with the ugly monkey paperweight on the desk. â€œIncluding deadly poisons. The one currently destroying your system? Quite similar to thallium. Itâ€™s odorless, tasteless, colorless. Hard to identify because itâ€™s so rare, and its symptoms often point to a range of other illnesses. But unlike thallium, it has no widely known antidote. Luckily for you, Uncle, there is
 a secret antidoteâ€”and I have a vial stashed away.â€
My uncle trembled with rage. â€œHow do I know youâ€™re not lying?â€
I shrugged. â€œGuess youâ€™ll have to trust me.â€
Three things happened at once. Ava threw herself at a distracted Camo and knocked the gun out of his hand, Bridgetâ€™s bodyguard tackled Camo from behind and caught him in a chokehold, and I whipped out the gun hidden in the shoulder holster beneath my coat and pointed it at my uncle. I used my other hand to send a quick, one-number message on my phone without taking my eyes off Ivan.
â€œStop!â€ he shouted.
Everyone froze until we resembled a grotesque comedic tableauâ€”Rhys with one arm around Camoâ€™s neck and the other pressing a gun to his temple; Ava and Bridget wriggling out of their restraints, me ready to shoot my uncle point-blank in the chest.
â€œAlex.â€ Ivan let out a nervous chuckle. â€œMy dear nephew, is this necessary? We are, after all, family.â€
â€œNo, weâ€™re not. You murdered my family.â€ I cocked my gun, and he paled. â€œAva, Bridget, leave the room.â€
They didnâ€™t move.

â€œNow.
 â€
Camo hadnâ€™t tied their legs, so they could scramble out of the room even though their hands were still bound.
â€œThink of all the good times we had together,â€ my uncle coaxed, his affable mask falling back into place. â€œWhen I took you to your first Krav Maga lesson, when we visited Kiev for your sixteenth birthâ€”â€
The shot rang out loud and clear over his pleas.
Ivan froze, his mouth hanging open in shock. A crimson stain bloomed across his chest.
â€œUnfortunately for you, Iâ€™m not someone who waxes poetic before I pull the trigger,â€ I said. I felt no hint of remorse for the man whoâ€™d raised me. He was a murderer and a liar. I was too, but Iâ€™d resigned myself to hell a long time ago. â€œYouâ€™ll die today, looking as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside.â€
â€œYou ungratefulâ€”â€
A second shot rang out. His body jerked. â€œThat was for my mother. The first was for my father. Thisâ€”â€ A third shot. â€œIs for Nina. For Ava. For Bridget. And thisâ€”â€ I cocked my gun for the last time. â€œIs for me.â€ I fired the bullet straight between his eyes.
My uncle was long dead by this point, his body riddled with holes and his feet steeped in a glistening pool of blood, but my words, like my bullets, werenâ€™t for him. They were for me, my own fucked-up version of closure.
I turned to Camo, whose complexion now resembled the color of chalk. Rhys still had him pinned to the ground.
I picked Camoâ€™s gun up from the floor and examined it. â€œYou can let him go,â€ I told Rhys. â€œHeâ€™s mine.â€
To his credit, the bodyguard didnâ€™t even blink. Heâ€™d maintained the same stoic expression from the moment he entered the room. I had a feeling the man wouldnâ€™t blink an eye even if aliens in silver tutus poofed into existence before him and started dancing the Macarena.
â€œYou sure?â€ He dug his gun harder into Camoâ€™s temple.
â€œIâ€™m sure. Your princess is waiting for youâ€”â€ My mouth formed a half-smirk. â€œSo let me take care of the trash.â€ I pointed my gun at Camo while holding the second weapon in my other hand.
Rhys pulled back, keeping his gun aimed at Camo but his gaze on me.

Smart man.

I could tell he wanted to fuck up Camo himself, but Bridget was his priority, and a bodyguardâ€™s mandate was cover and evacuation, not combat.
The second he disappeared, I fired two shots into Camoâ€™s kneecapsâ€”not to kill, merely to hobble him while I went to work. I ignored his pained screams as I locked the door.
â€œYou made a mistake today,â€ I said conversationally, kneeling next to him. Images of Avaâ€™s bruises and terrified face flashed through my mind, and my expression hardened. â€œYou touched what was mineâ€”â€ I pulled a wicked-looking knife from my boot. Camoâ€™s eyes popped in terror. â€œYou hurt what was mineâ€”â€ The smell of urine filled the air as he pissed himself. For such a tough-looking dude, he scared easily. My lips curled in distaste. â€œAnd now, itâ€™s time to pay. Donâ€™t worry.â€ I pulled his shirt up and dug the tip of the blade into his abdomen. â€œIâ€™ll make it slow and sweet.â€
If Ava and Bridget had already called the policeâ€”which I was sure they hadâ€”I only had precious minutes before they arrived. But with a few handy tools and creativity? One could make a minute feel like an eternity.
We didnâ€™t pass the ten-second mark before Camoâ€™s screams started again.

Ava






The next hour
 passed in a blur. The police and paramedics arrived, peppering me with questions and medical checkups and lots of somber-looking faces. I endured them all, my answers flat and robotic.
By the time they finished, I wanted to crawl into my bed and never get outâ€”if
 I could bring myself to move.
â€œAva?â€ Bridget placed a tentative hand on my arm. â€œThe police said we can go. Rhys will drive us back.â€
The massive bodyguard hovered so close he was practically on top of us, his usual stoic mask replaced with pure fury.
I didnâ€™t blame him. Weâ€™d gotten ourselves into this mess.
Bridget and I had wanted to see one of our favorite bands perform in D.C. last night. Cool indie bands didnâ€™t visit the city often, and when they did, we took advantage. Exceptâ€¦Rhys had flat-out forbidden
 Bridget from going because it wasnâ€™t safe, and instead of arguing with himâ€”which we all knew by now was uselessâ€”Bridget snuck out in the middle of the night. Everything had gone according to plan until the camouflage-wearing psycho yanked us off the street after the concert and into the back of his van. Itâ€™d happened so fast we didnâ€™t have time to scream. Weâ€™d fought back as hard as we could, and my amateur self-defense training allowed me to land a few hits, but heâ€™d eventually knocked us out. When we woke up, we found ourselves in freakinâ€™ Philadelphia.
A shudder rippled down my spine. Our kidnapper mustâ€™ve been watching us for God knew how long before he made his move, which creeped me out more than the actual kidnapping part.
â€œAre you ready?â€ Despite her calm tone, I detected a small shake in Bridgetâ€™s shoulders, and I suspected that was the reason Rhys hadnâ€™t torn us a new one yet. In fact, he hadnâ€™t said a word to us except to explain heâ€™d found us via the chip heâ€™d placed in Bridgetâ€™s phone, which heâ€™d activated when he discovered she wasnâ€™t in her room that morning. It was a testament to how much weâ€™d fucked up that Bridget didnâ€™t utter a peep about him secretly tracking her.
My eyes strayed toward Alex, who looked remarkably composed for someone whoâ€™d shot his uncle, killed our kidnapper, and almost died himself.
He spoke with a police officer, his face not betraying a hint of agitation.

You were nothing more than a means to an end.

â€œAlmost,â€ I said. My voice sounded strange to my ears. Low and hollow, almost lifeless. â€œI need to talk to him.â€
Bridget and Rhys exchanged glances, their mutual concern for me overshadowing their animosity.
â€œAve, Iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s a good ideaâ€”â€
I ignored her. I stood, stepped around Bridget, and walked toward Alex, keeping the blanket the EMT gave me wrapped tight around my shoulders.

One foot in front of the other.

This entire day felt surreal. I kept thinking it was a new type of nightmare and that I would wake up at any moment, but I never did. Even when I told the police what happened, I felt like I was talking about a movie, not my life.
The story came out in pieces and half-truths. I told the officers Alexâ€™s uncle hired someone to kidnap us as leverage because Alex had ousted him as CEO, but I didnâ€™t mention their twisted family history. That wasnâ€™t my story to tell. I could honestly say I didnâ€™t know what happened after Bridget and I leftâ€”how Alexâ€™s uncle had ended up with six bullets in him or how the kidnapper had, according to the queasy-looking officer, ended up more carved up than a jack-o'-lantern on steroids. I technically didnâ€™t
 know, but it didnâ€™t take a genius to figure out what happened.
I wasnâ€™t sure what Alex told the police but considering they hadnâ€™t arrested him for killing two people yet, I assumed heâ€™d spun a convincing tale of self-defense.
He was, after all, the consummate liar. Right? Or had he been lying about lying?
There was only one way to find out.
Alex noticed me first. He said something to the officer, who nodded and left.
I stopped two feet from him, my hands strangling the blanket.
He looked like old Alex againâ€”unruffled and uncaring, with eyes like chips of jade-colored ice. I didnâ€™t see a hint of the Alex Iâ€™d gotten to know over the past few months. The one whoâ€™d stayed and canceled a date to watch movies with me, the one whoâ€™d choked down one of the most disgusting cookies ever made and lied about it being â€œfineâ€ because he didnâ€™t want to hurt my feelings, the one whoâ€™d taught me to swim and showed me a world Iâ€™d thought only existed in fantasies. A world in which I loved and had been loved in return. He hadnâ€™t said it, but I thoughtâ€¦Iâ€™d really thought he loved me and had just been too scared to say it.
Now, I questioned whether the Alex I â€œknewâ€ had ever existed. Perhaps it really had all been a ruse, a role played by a psychopath bent on vengeance and taking advantage of my unsuspecting heart.
Orâ€¦heâ€™d been lying, and heâ€™d said all those things in front of his uncle to save me because he didnâ€™t want his uncle to know he cared. His tale seemed too elaborate to be fake, but Alex was a genius. He could do anything.
I clung to the tattered remains of my hope with bloody fingers.
â€œI thought you wouldâ€™ve left by now.â€ He slid his hands into his pockets, the picture of cool nonchalance.
â€œI wanted to speak to you first.â€
â€œWhy?â€
Heat rose on my face. Leave before you embarrass yourself any further!
 my pride screamed, but that horrible flicker of hope insisted I stay until the end.
â€œI wanted to know.â€
He lifted a bored brow.
â€œYou and me.â€ I was almost afraid to ask, but I had to know. â€œWas any of it real?â€
Alex stilled, and I held my breath, hoping, prayingâ€¦
â€œI tried to warn you, sweetheart,â€ he said, his face impassive. â€œI told you not to romanticize me, to harden that soft heart. It was my one courtesy for the kindness youâ€™ve shown me over the years. But you fell for me, anyway.â€ His jaw tightened. â€œConsider it a lesson for the future. Pretty words and pretty faces donâ€™t equal pretty souls.â€
My hope turned to ashes.

My soft heart?
 No. I didnâ€™t have a heart at all, not anymore. Heâ€™d torn it out of my chest, sliced it to ribbons with the blades of his words, and tossed the shreds aside without a second thought.

I should say something.
 Anything. But I couldnâ€™t think of a single thing.
I wished for an iota of my earlier anger and hurt, but none came. I was numb.
I mightâ€™ve stood there forever had gentle hands not guided me into Rhysâ€™s waiting car. I thought I heard Bridget hiss something at Alex, but I couldnâ€™t be sure. It didnâ€™t matter.
Nothing mattered.
Bridget didnâ€™t try to talk to me or feed me platitudes. That wouldâ€™ve only made things worse. Instead, she let me sit in silence and stare out the window, watching dead tree after dead tree fly by. I couldnâ€™t remember why I liked winter. Everything looked dull and gray. Lifeless.
I made it all the way to the border of Maryland. There, it started raining, the tiny drops sprinkling over the window like scattershot crystals. I remembered the day Alex picked me up when I was stranded in the rain, and I. Broke. Down.
All my pent-up emotion from the past few hoursâ€”the past few monthsâ€”
 burst forth at the same time. I was an ant swept up in a tidal wave, and I didnâ€™t bother fighting. I let it wash over meâ€”the hurt, the anger, the heartbreak and betrayal and sadnessâ€”until my eyes burned and my muscles ached from the force of sobs.
Somehow, I found myself curled up in Bridgetâ€™s lap while she stroked my hair and murmured soothing sounds. It wouldâ€™ve been terribly embarrassing, crying into a royal princessâ€™s lap, except I was beyond caring.
Why was it always me?
What about me made me so damn unlovable? So gullible
 ?

My favorite color.


Yellow.


My favorite ice cream flavor.


Mint chocolate chip.


You are the light to my dark, Sunshine. Without you, Iâ€™m lost.

Lies. All of it.
Every kiss, every word, every second that I had treasuredâ€¦tainted.
My eyes burned with liquid fire. I couldnâ€™t breathe. Everything hurt, from the outside to the inside, as I sobbed terrible, wretched, soul-wracking tears.
Michael had lied to me. Alex had lied to me. Not for days, weeks, or months, but for years.

Something inside me broke, and I was no longer only crying for my shattered heart but for the girl I used to beâ€”the one whoâ€™d believed in light and love and the goodness of the world.
That girl was gone.

Alex






I watched Ava leave,
 my chest hollow, my eyes burning with a foreign, pent-up emotion.
I wanted to run after her and snatch her out of Bridgetâ€™s arms. To fall to my knees and beg her forgiveness for the unforgivable. To keep her by my side for the rest of our days so nothing and no one could hurt her again.
Except I couldnâ€™t, because I
 was the one whoâ€™d hurt her. I was the one whoâ€™d lied and manipulated. I was the one whoâ€™d endangered her with my thirst for vengeance and twisted plans against my uncle.
The only way to protect Ava was to let her go, even if that meant destroying myself.
The car taking Ava back to Maryland and away from me disappeared from sight, and I released a shuddering breath, trying to make sense of the pain clawing at my insides. It felt like someone was ripping out pieces of my heart and soul and grinding them beneath their feet. I had never felt so acutely, so much.

I hated it. I longed for the icy indifference of numbness, but I feared this was my penanceâ€”to burn in the flames of my self-inflicted agony for the rest of eternity.
My personal living hell. My own walking damnation.
â€œAlex.â€ The head of my Philly team approached me, his movements sharp and precise. He wore a Philadelphia police uniform, the badge gleaming in the afternoon soon, but he was no officer of the law. â€œThe house is ready.â€
â€œGood.â€ I noticed Rocco staring at me with a strange expression. â€œWhat?â€ I snapped.
â€œNothing.â€ He cleared his throat. â€œYou just look like youâ€™re about toâ€”never mind.â€
â€œFinish the sentence. About to what?â€ My voice dropped to a dangerous decibel. I had clean-up teams on standby in various cities, ready to swoop in in case any of my many plans went awry. No one knew about them, not even my uncle when heâ€™d been alive. They were discreet, efficient, and looked like normal people who held normal jobsâ€”not fixers who could bury any body, erase any evidence, and jam any communicationsâ€¦including outgoing calls to local police stations.
Every â€œpolice officerâ€ and â€œparamedicâ€ whoâ€™d showed up today was on my team, and theyâ€™d played their roles convincingly.
Rocco looked like he wished heâ€™d never opened his mouth. â€œLike youâ€™re about to, ah, cry.â€ He flinched, no doubt aware that even though heâ€™d intercepted Avaâ€™s 911 call and pulled the team together in record time, that wouldnâ€™t shield him from my wrath.
The fire in my veins matched the burning behind my eyes. I didnâ€™t dignify Roccoâ€™s statement with a response; I merely glared at him until he wilted. â€œAre there any other foolish observations youâ€™d like to share with me?â€ My voice couldâ€™ve frozen the Sahara.
He gulped. â€œNo, sir.â€
â€œGood. Iâ€™ll take care of the house.â€
There was a short pause. â€œPersonally? Are youâ€”â€ He stopped when he saw the look on my face. â€œOf course. Iâ€™ll tell the others.â€
While he rounded up the rest of the team, I walked into the mansion where Iâ€™d spent the better part of my life. It was home, but itâ€™d never felt like home, not even when my uncle and I had been on good terms.
It made what I had to do that much easier.
Rocco gave me the go signal from outside the entrance.
I retrieved the lighter from my pocket and flicked it open. The smell of kerosene soaked the air, but I didnâ€™t hesitate as I walked to the nearest set of curtains and tossed the flame at the thick gold material.
It was amazing how fast fire could spread across a ten-thousand-square-foot building. The flames licked the walls and ceiling, ravenous in their pursuit of destruction, and I was tempted to stay there and let them consume me. But my sense of self-preservation kicked in at the last minute, and I escaped through the open front door, the scent of charred ashes lingering in my nose.
My team and I stood a safe distance away, watching the proud brick manor burn until it came time to contain it before it spread out of control. The manor sat on acres of private property, and no one would know about the fire until hours, if not days, later. Not unless I told them.
Eventually, I would. Itâ€™d be a tragic story of how an errant cigarette caught fire and how the ailing lord of the manor, whoâ€™d refused to hire a full staff and lived alone, failed to put it out in time. It would be a small news item, buried in the back pages of the local paper. Iâ€™d make sure of it.
But for now, I simply stood and watched the flames incinerate the corpses of my uncle, Camo, and my past until there was nothing left.

Alex






Joshâ€™s fist
 slammed into my face, and I heard an ominous crack
 before I stumbled back. Blood dripped from my nose and lip, and judging by the pain radiating from the right side of my face, I was going to wake up with one hell of a shiner tomorrow.
Still, I made no move to defend myself while Josh pummeled me. â€œYou fucking bastard,â€ he hissed, his eyes wild as he kneed my stomach. I doubled over, the breath stolen from my lungs in a wet, crimson-stained gasp. â€œYou. Motherfucking. Bastard.
 I trusted you!â€ Another punch, this time to the side of my rib. â€œYou were my. Best. Friend!â€
The hits continued until I dropped to my knees, my body a mess of cuts and bruises.
But I welcomed the pain. Reveled in it.
It was what I deserved.
â€œI always knew you had bad taste,â€ I rasped. Note to self: work from home until the injuries heal.
 I didnâ€™t need the office running wild with rumors. Everyone was still whispering about my uncleâ€™s death, which was officially attributed to the fire thatâ€™d reduced the manor and everything in it to ashes.
Josh grabbed me by the collar and hauled me up, his face tight with pain and fury. â€œYou think this is funny? Ava was right. You are
 a psychopath.â€

Ava.
 The name sliced through me like a razor-sharp knife. No physical beating could hurt more than thinking of her. Her face before she walked away would haunt me for the rest of my days, and thanks to my fucking cursed memory, I remembered every detail of every second. The scent of blood and sweat staining my skin, the way her shoulders trembled as she clutched the blanket with white-knuckled handsâ€¦the moment the faint light of hope died in her eyes.
My gut wrenched.
I may not have killed her physically, but I had killed her spirit, her innocence. The part of her that believed the best in people and saw beauty in the ugliest of hearts.

Was any of it real?


Yes, Sunshine. All of it. Realer than I ever thought possible.

Words I wished Iâ€™d been able to say, except I hadnâ€™t. Sheâ€™d gotten hurt and almost killed because of me. Iâ€™d failed to protect her, just like Iâ€™d failed to protect my sister, my parents. Perhaps it was my curse to watch everyone I loved suffer.
I was a genius, but Iâ€™d been so arrogant Iâ€™d overlooked a crucial weakness in my plan. Iâ€™d anticipated my uncle might go after Ava, but I shouldâ€™ve had a team monitoring her twenty-four seven instead of just during the day. That one error of judgment had almost cost me the one thing I couldnâ€™t live without.
Except I lost her anyway. Because while I may be a selfish son of a bitch, the only thing that would gut me more than not having her by my side was seeing her hurt again. Iâ€™d made plenty of enemies over the years, and once they discovered my weaknessâ€”because she was
 my weakness, the only one I ever hadâ€”they wouldnâ€™t hesitate to do what my uncle did. Ava would never be safe as long as she was with me, so I let her go.
She was mineâ€¦but I let her go.
I didnâ€™t think I had a heart before I met her, but she proved I didâ€”it lay in pieces at her feet.
â€œFight back,â€ Josh growled. â€œFight back so I can kill you, you bastard.â€
â€œNo. And not because Iâ€™m afraid to die.â€ Hell, Iâ€™d welcome it. I flashed a grim smile. The movement sent another burst of pain through my skull. â€œThis is your freebie. One session of unlimited beating for eight years of lies.â€
His mouth twisted, and he shoved me away with disgust. â€œIf you think one beatdown will make up for what youâ€™ve done, youâ€™re delusional. You wanted to use me? Fine. But you brought my sister into this, and for that, I will never forgive you.â€

That makes two of us.

â€œIâ€™m not wasting any more energy on you. You donâ€™t deserve it.â€ Joshâ€™s jaw flexed. â€œYou were my best friend,â€ he repeated, his voice cracking on the last word.
Another, altogether different type of pain lanced through me. Iâ€™d originally befriended Josh because he was Michaelâ€™s son, but over the years, he really had become my best friend. My uncle had been my last living relative, but Josh had been my brother. It had nothing to do with blood and everything to do with choice.
Truth was, I couldâ€™ve taken Michael down a long time ago, but Iâ€™d stalled out of loyalty to Josh. Iâ€™d made excuses as to why I dragged out my plan, even to myself, but deep down, I hadnâ€™t wanted to hurt him.

You were my best friend too.

Joshâ€™s face hardened once more. â€œIf I ever see you near me or Ava again, I will
 kill you.â€ He shot one last disgusted glance in my direction before he left.
The door banged shut, and I lay there, staring at the ceiling for what felt like hours. Movers had already packed up my belongings and transported them to my new penthouse in D.C. I couldnâ€™t stay in this house any longerâ€”it was too full of memories, of faded laughs and conversations that stretched deep into the night. Not just with Ava, but with Josh. Weâ€™d lived here together in college, and it had been some of the best years of my life.
I closed my eyes, and for once, I allowed myself to sink into a good memory instead of a painful one.

â€œSing one
song. Just one,â€ Ava pleaded. â€œItâ€™ll be my birthday present.â€


I shot her an unimpressed look, even as I held back a laugh at her exaggerated pout and puppy dog eyes. How could someone so sexy also be so fucking adorable? â€œYour birthday isnâ€™t until March.â€


â€œItâ€™ll be my
 early birthday present.â€


â€œNice try, Sunshine.â€ I wrapped my arms around her waist from behind and brushed my lips over her neck, smiling when I heard her sharp inhale. My quickly hardening cock fit perfectly against her ass, like we were tailor-made for each other. â€œIâ€™m not singing.â€


â€œWhat do you have against music?â€ she huffed, even as she arched against me when I grazed my thumb over one perfect, peaked nipple. I could never get enough of her. I wanted to tie her up and devour her all day, every day. The rest of the world didnâ€™t deserve her. Neither did I, but she was here, and she was mine, so fuck what I deserved. I took what I wanted.


â€œNothing against music.â€ I pinched her nipple, and she ground against my now rock-hard cock in response. â€œJust donâ€™t like singing.â€


I did it once at some stupid karaoke spot my uncle dragged me to, and I never sang again. Not because I thought I was badâ€”I was Alex Volkov; I could do anythingâ€”but because singing felt too raw, too personal, like I was baring my soul with each note leaving my throat. That held true even when it was a stupid pop song. All music, no matter how cheesy, was grounded in emotions, and Iâ€™d built my reputation on having noneâ€”unless I was with Ava.


Desire pumped through my veins.


I had her all to myself before Jules got home from work in an hour, and I was going to take advantage of every second.


â€œBut if you really want an early birthday presentâ€¦â€ I spun Ava around, and she laughed, the sound filling the room with its warmth. â€œI have something in mind.â€


â€œOh? Whatâ€™s that?â€ she teased, looping her arms around my neck.


â€œI could tell you orâ€¦â€ I kissed my way down her chest and stomach until I reached the sweet perfection between her thighs. â€œI could show you.â€

I yanked myself out of the scene, my heart pounding. Like all my memories, it was so vivid it might as well be happening in real time. Except it wasnâ€™t, and all that surrounded me was emptiness and cold air.
My chest cracked. Now I remembered why Iâ€™d held off on reliving the good memoriesâ€”every time I returned to reality, it was like losing Ava all over again. I was a fucked-up Prometheus, suffering for eternity, except instead of having my liver eaten by an asshole eagle every day, it was my heart breaking over and over.
I lay there until the shadows lengthened and my back ached from the hardwood floor. Only then did I force myself to stand and limp to my car.
The house next door was dark and silent, matching the weather. Iâ€™d been so caught up in my misery I hadnâ€™t realized it was storming. Rain fell in furious sheets, and angry bolts of lightning split the sky in half, illuminating the barren winter trees and cracked pavement.
Not a hint of sunshine or life to be found.

Ava








TWO MONTHS LATER



Bridget convinced Rhys not to tell the palace what happened in Philadelphia. I didnâ€™t know how, because Rhys was such a stickler for the rulesâ€”even if telling the truth meant getting himself in trouble, since Bridget had been kidnapped on his watchâ€”but she did.
The press also never picked up on the real story. Other than a small item about an â€œaccidental house fire that resulted in the death of former Archer Group CEO Ivan Volkov,â€ it was like the worst six hours of my life hadnâ€™t happened.
I suspected Alex had a hand in both the fire and the lack of media coverage, but I tried not to think of him these days.
Once or twice, I succeeded.
â€œI brought cake.â€ Jules slid a red velvet cupcake in my direction. â€œYour fave.â€ Her face glowed with hope as she waited for my response.
My friends tried their best to put on happy faces around me, but I heard their whispers and saw their sidelong glancesâ€”they were worried. Really worried. So was Josh, who quit his volunteer program and moved back to Hazelburg for â€œmoral support.â€ Heâ€™d landed a few days after the Philly incident for his belated holiday break, and when he found out what happened, he went berserk. Thatâ€™d been almost two months ago.
I was grateful for my friendsâ€™ support, but I needed more time. Space. They meant well, but I couldnâ€™t breathe with them hovering all the time.
â€œI donâ€™t want it.â€ I pushed the cupcake away from me. Red velvet.
 Like the cookies Iâ€™d baked for Alex as a welcome-to-the-neighborhood gift a lifetime ago.
I couldnâ€™t stand anything red velvet these days.
â€œYou havenâ€™t eaten yet, and itâ€™s already late afternoon.â€ For once, Stella wasnâ€™t glued to her phone. Instead, she stared at me with concern scrawled all over her face.
â€œIâ€™m not hungry.â€
Jules, Bridget, and Stella exchanged glances. Iâ€™d moved in with Bridget because I couldnâ€™t stand living near Alex anymore. Even though heâ€™d moved out soon after I did, I couldnâ€™t look at that house without thinking of him, and every time I thought of him, I felt like I was drowning.
Helpless. Unmoored. Unable to breathe.
â€œYour birthdayâ€™s coming up. We should celebrate.â€ Bridget switched topics. â€œHow about a spa day? You love massages, and itâ€™ll be on me.â€
I shook my head.
â€œOr maybe something simple like a movie night?â€ Stella suggested. â€œPJs, junk food, junk movies.â€
â€œMovies so bad theyâ€™re almost good,â€ Jules added.
â€œOkay.â€ I didnâ€™t feel like celebrating, but I also didnâ€™t feel like arguing, and they would bug me until I agreed to something.
 â€œIâ€™m going to take a nap.â€
I didnâ€™t wait for them to answer before I pushed my chair back and went upstairs to my room. I locked the door and climbed into bed, but I couldnâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™d stopped having so many nightmares after I regained my memories, but it was now my waking hours that I dreaded.
I lay in the dark, listening to the rain outside and watching the shadows dance across my ceiling. The past two months had both flown by and dragged on, with each day bleeding into the next in an endless sludge of numbness. Yet I woke up every morning, surprised Iâ€™d survived another day. Between Michaelâ€™s and Alexâ€™s betrayals, I had depleted my capacity to cry.
I hadnâ€™t shed a single tear since I returned from Philadelphia.
My phone pinged with a new email notification on the nightstand. I ignored it. It was probably a stupid ten percent off coupon for something I didnâ€™t need.
Then again, it wasnâ€™t like I could sleep, and the sound lingered in the silence.
I sighed and grabbed my cell, opening the new email with all the enthusiasm of a prisoner on their way to Death Row. It was the orientation package for the WYP fellowship, complete with a calendar of classes and activities for the year, a list of housing suggestions, and a mini travel guide to New York City.
I was graduating and moving to Manhattan in May. Itâ€™d been my dream since I was thirteen, but I couldnâ€™t summon a flicker of excitement at the prospect. New York was too close to D.C. for comfort, and to be honest, I hadnâ€™t picked up my camera in weeks. I even canceled my engagement shoot with Elliott and his fiancÃ©e because I didnâ€™t think I could do them justice. Heâ€™d been disappointed, but Iâ€™d steered them toward another photographer who could help. My clients deserved better than what I could give them because at this point, I had zero inspiration or motivation to shoot.
I was entering the worldâ€™s most prestigious fellowship in two-and-a-half months, and my creative well was drier than the Kalahari Desert. One more beautiful thing in my life, ruined.
Out of nowhere, fury blasted through me, shocking me out of my stupor.
This shouldâ€™ve been the best, most exciting time of my life. It was my senior year, and my dream program had accepted me. Instead of celebrating, I was moping like aâ€¦well, a heartbroken teenager. And even though that was half correct, I was sick of it. Sick of letting men who didnâ€™t give two shits about me have this hold over me. Sick of being the object of pitying looks and worried whispers.
Maybe I was that person in the past, but not anymore.
Anger and indignation rushed through my veins, compelling me to get out of bed and rifle through my drawers until I found what I was looking for. I put it on, covered it up with a hoodie and jeans, and shoved my feet into boots. I walked down the stairs and found my friends huddled in the living room. Rhys stood in the corner, stone-faced and watchful.
â€œDo you want a ride somewhere?â€ Bridget asked when she saw my outfit. â€œItâ€™s pouring outside.â€
â€œNo, I have an umbrella.â€
â€œWhere are you going?â€ Stella asked. â€œIâ€™ll goâ€”â€
â€œItâ€™s okay. I have something I need to doâ€”alone.â€
A small frown took over her face. â€œI donâ€™t thinkâ€”â€
â€œI mean it.â€ I took a deep breath. â€œI appreciate all you guys have done, I really do, but I need to do this for me. I wonâ€™t hurt myself or do anything crazy. I just need you to trust me.â€
There was a long silence before Jules finally broke it. â€œOf course we trust you,â€ she said softly. â€œYouâ€™re our best friend.â€
â€œBut if you need us, weâ€™re here.â€ Bridgetâ€™s warm, sympathetic gaze caused a messy knot of emotion to form in my throat. â€œYou donâ€™t have to do anything alone if you donâ€™t want to.â€
â€œJust send a text, call, carrier pigeon, whatever,â€ Stella added. â€œMy Instagram inbox gets crazy sometimes, but that works too.â€
I swallowed the lump in my throat and huffed out a small laugh. â€œThank you. Iâ€™ll be back soon. Promise.â€
I grabbed the umbrella by the front door, feeling the heat of my friendsâ€™ worried gazes on my back, and stepped out into the storm. My boots squeaked on the wet sidewalks as I walked toward a campus building Iâ€™d never visited in all my years at Thayer. One, because I was lazy, and two, because I was afraidâ€¦of a certain room, anyway.
I swiped my student ID at the front desk and consulted the map before winding my way to the back. It was a rainy Sunday in March, so there werenâ€™t many people here. The New Yearâ€™s Resolution people, the ones whoâ€™d vowed to exercise more in the new year, had given up by now, and the gym rats were apparently taking the day off.
I pushed open the door to the pool room, breathing a sigh of relief when I saw that it too, was empty. It was a gorgeous space, with pale tile floors and a giant skylight over the pool.
I kicked off my boots and shrugged off my clothes until I had on only my swimsuit.
The smell of chlorine didnâ€™t nauseate me as much as it used to. Iâ€™d gotten used to it after all my swim lessons with Alâ€”after all my swim lessons. Still, my skin prickled with unease at the undulations in the pale turquoise water, which seemed to stretch forever in its Olympic-sized concrete container.
I hadnâ€™t had a swim lesson in months. I thought
 I remembered the basics, but what if I didnâ€™t?
My chest tightened, and it took more effort than it shouldâ€™ve to draw enough oxygen into my lungs.
It was worse when Alâ€”when I was alone. If I drowned, no one would find me until later. Thereâ€™d be no one to save me.
But that was the point of this exercise, wasnâ€™t it? To do this alone.

Breathe, Ava. You wonâ€™t drown. You know how to swim.

I opened my eyes and took a few shaky steps toward the edge of the pool. It seemed bottomless, even though the markers indicated it was eight feet deep at its deepest.
Before I lost my nerve, I stepped in, trying not to flinch at the sensation of cold water lapping at my ankles. My knees. My thighs. My chest. My shoulders.
Okay. This wasnâ€™t so bad. Iâ€™d been in a pool dozens of times before. I could do this.

Not alone,
 a taunting voice in my head sang. What makes you think you can do this alone?

â€œShut. Up,â€ I gritted out, my voice echoing in the empty space.
I held my breath and, after saying a quick prayer, ducked my head beneath the water. I fought the immediate urge to panic. Youâ€™re fine, youâ€™re fine
 . I was still in the shallow end of the pool, and I could lift my head at any time.
I closed my eyes, the events of the past six months flashing through my mind.
Josh announcing he was leaving for Central America. Me getting stranded in a rainstorm in the middle of nowhere. Alexâ€”there, I said his full name
 â€”picking me up. Alex moving in next door. Alexâ€”
My head broke above the water, and I gasped for air. I allowed myself a minute break before I dove again.
Alexâ€™s birthday. Our first kiss. Our weekend at the hotel. Thanksgiving. My father. My kidnapping.

Sweet, trusting Ava, so eager to fix broken things.


Was any of it real?

Again and again. Head in, head out. It was the first time Iâ€™d allowed myself to dwell on Alex and our time together since Philadelphia. Razor blades pierced my chest at the memory of his voice, his eyes, his touchâ€¦but I was still here. I was alive. And, for once, the water didnâ€™t seem like an enemy. It seemed like a friend, swallowing my tears and cleansing me of the past.
I couldnâ€™t change what happened to me or control what other people did, but I could control what I
 did. I could shape the future I wanted to have.
When the restless energy became too much, I stopped holding my breath underwater and started swimming. I wouldnâ€™t win an Olympic medal anytime soon, but I could move my body from one point to the other in the pool, which was more than I could say for myself this time last year.
All my life, people had coddled me. Josh. My friends. Alex. Or at least, heâ€™d pretended to care about me. Iâ€™d let them, because it was easier to lean on others than myself. Iâ€™d thought myself free because I didnâ€™t have a physical cage when in fact Iâ€™d been trapped by my own mind, by the fears that haunted my days and the nightmares that haunted my nights. I stuck with the safe choices because I thought I wasnâ€™t strong enough for anything else.
But Iâ€™d survived not one, not two, but three
 near-death experiences. Iâ€™d had my heart broken and smashed, but I was still breathing. Iâ€™d lived with my nightmares almost my whole life and still found the courage to dream.
I swam until my limbs ached.
After that, I stayed in the pool for a while longer, reveling in my accomplishment. Me, swimming alone, forâ€”I snuck a peek at the clockâ€”an hour without a panic attack. More
 than an hour.
I tilted my head up, my first real smile in months spreading across my face. It was small, but it was there.

Baby steps.

Above me, the storm had abated, the angry gray clouds giving way to blue skies. And through the domed glass, I saw, quite clearly, the pale glimmers of a rainbow.

Alex








TWO AND A
 HALF MONTHS LATER


â€œYou look like shit.â€ Ralph sank into the chair opposite mine and appraised me with sharp eyes. â€œHavenâ€™t â€˜cha heard of a skincare routine?â€
I didnâ€™t look up from the screen. â€œCarolina!â€
The door to my office opened, and my assistant poked her head in. â€œYes, Mr. Volkov?â€
â€œHow the fuck did he get in here?â€ I gestured at Ralph.
â€œHeâ€™s on your approved list of visitors who donâ€™t need appointments.â€
â€œRemove him from the list.â€
â€œYes, sir.â€ Carolina hesitated. â€œDo youâ€”â€
â€œYou can leave.â€
She fled without a second thought. I didnâ€™t blame her. Iâ€™d been in a foul mood for months, and sheâ€™d learned it was best to stay out of sight.
Ralph arched his eyebrows. â€œSomeoneâ€™s in a bad mood.â€
â€œDonâ€™t you have a business to run?â€ I clicked out of the spreadsheet Iâ€™d been examining and leaned back, irritation coiling in my stomach. I didnâ€™t have time for bullshit today. I barely had time for lunch.
Ever since I took over as CEO of Archer Group, the companyâ€™s stocks had shot sky-high. Likely because I worked nonstop, more than I ever had. I barely left my office. Work kept me busy, and busy was good.
â€œAh, about that.â€ He rubbed the back of his neck. â€œI wanted to tell you in person.â€
â€œWhatever it is, make it quick. I have a phone call with the Vice-President in an hour.â€ I picked up my glass of whisky and drained the rest of the Macallan.
Yes, it was only noon. No, I didnâ€™t give a fuck.
â€œThe Vice-President of the Unitedâ€”â€ Ralph shook his head. â€œNever mind, I donâ€™t wanna know. But since you asked, here it is. Iâ€™m retiring and moving to Vermont.â€
â€œFunny.â€
â€œIâ€™m not joking. Iâ€™m retiring and moving to Vermont,â€ he repeated.
I stared at him. Ralph stared back, his face calm. â€œYouâ€™re shitting me.â€
Ralph was one of those guys I pictured working till the day he died, simply because he loved his job. He took immense pride in the fact heâ€™d built KMA into the cityâ€™s best training center over the years, and he hadnâ€™t given a single indication he wanted to retire until now.
â€œNah. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for a while. I love KMA, but I ainâ€™t no spring chicken anymore, and Missy and I have saved up enough for retirement. Plus, the missus has been wanting to get out to the country for a while.â€ Ralph drummed his fingers on the desk. â€œShe grew up in Vermont. Always wanted to go back.â€
I needed another drink. â€œWhat the hell are you going to do in Vermont?â€
â€œFuck if I know. Guess I should find a hobby.â€ Ralph flashed a crooked smile before it dimmed. â€œI know itâ€™s sudden, but I didnâ€™t decide until yesterday. I wanted to tell you first. Donâ€™t tell the other students, butâ€¦youâ€™ve always been the biggest pain in my ass.â€
That was as close to a sentimental statement as Ralph would get.
I snorted. â€œThanks. So.â€ I assessed him with narrowed eyes. â€œWhatâ€™s happening with the academy?â€
â€œMy nephew will take it over. Heâ€™ll do a good job.â€ Ralph laughed at my grimace. â€œI know youâ€™re not his biggest fan, but heâ€™s been running things alongside me for years. He has what it takes.â€
â€œWeâ€™ll see.â€ His nephew may have what it takes, but Ralph was Ralph. â€œWhen are you moving?â€
â€œEnd of August. Gives us time to put our affairs in order here, and fall in Vermont is nice as hell.â€ My mentorâ€™s face softened. â€œYou can call or visit anytime. My door is always open for you.â€
â€œFine.â€ I shuffled the papers on my desk. â€œWeâ€™ll grab a meal before you leave.â€
â€œI mean it, Alex. Donâ€™t give me that Iâ€™m-an-asshole-who-doesnâ€™t-need-anyone shit, either. I know itâ€™s been a tough couple oâ€™ months with Avaâ€”â€

â€œDonâ€™t.
 â€ My jaw clenched. â€œWeâ€™re not discussing her. Period.â€
Ava had stopped taking Krav Maga lessons at KMA, which Iâ€™d expected, but Ralph hadnâ€™t stopped bugging me about her since he found out about our breakup. I didnâ€™t give him the nitty-gritty; I simply told him things didnâ€™t work out.
Which didnâ€™t stop him from prying. He was a persistent bastard.
â€œNever figured you one to run away from your troubles,â€ he said.
â€œIâ€™m not running from anything.â€
â€œThen why do you look like hell? Not to mention youâ€™ve been in a foul mood since January. Whatever you didâ€”â€
â€œWeâ€™re. Not. Discussing. It.â€ A vein throbbed in my temple. This
 was why I abhorred human companionship. People couldnâ€™t shut the hell up. â€œNow, if youâ€™ll excuse meâ€”â€
â€œSir?â€ Carolina poked her head in again, her face pale and not a little terrified. â€œUh, you have another guest.â€
â€œIf they donâ€™t have an appointment, I donâ€™t want to see them.â€
â€œAbout that, itâ€™sâ€”â€
â€œDonâ€™t bother, Iâ€™ll announce myself.â€ A statuesque blonde swept in like she owned the place. The vein in my temple pulsed harder. â€œPrincess Bridget of Eldorra, here to see Assholeâ€”I mean, Alex Volkov.â€ Her smile came off both polite and menacing.
I was impressed, if not annoyed.
How hard was it to find competent staff who could keep intruders out of my office these days?
â€œPrincess.â€ Ralph waved two fingers in the air.
â€œRalphie.â€ She nodded.

Ralphie?
 I wasnâ€™t going to ask.
Bridgetâ€™s bruiser of a bodyguard stood behind her with his ever-present glower. He might be the one person in the world who had a better poker face and a shittier disposition than I did.
â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€ Carolina looked like she was on the verge of panic. â€œThe princessâ€”â€
â€œLeave. Iâ€™ll take care of it.â€ My call with the VP was in forty minutes, and Iâ€™d already wasted enough time.
â€œThatâ€™s my cue.â€ Ralph rose. â€œIâ€™ll take you up on the meal, but it looks like you have some stuff to hash out first.â€ He tilted his head toward Bridget but kept his eyes on me. â€œThink about what I said.â€
â€œSure.â€ I would rather eat rusted nails than visit Vermont. I didnâ€™t do country life.
When the door closed behind Ralph and Carolina, I leaned back in my chair and laced my fingers over my chest. â€œTo what do I owe the pleasure, Your Highness?â€ I kept my expression impassive and tried not to think of the last time Iâ€™d seen Bridgetâ€”in her car, taking Ava from me.
Even if I was the one whoâ€™d pushed Ava away, I hated Bridget a little for that. For being able to comfort Ava when I couldnâ€™t.
The blonde looked down her nose at me. â€œI know what you did.â€
â€œYouâ€™ll have to be more specific. Iâ€™ve done a lot of things in my life, as you well know.â€
â€œCut the bullshit.â€ Bridget walked up to my desk and leaned forward, pressing her hands on the table. Her eyes glinted with steely knowledge. â€œYouâ€™re having Ava followed.â€
My shoulders stiffened before I forced them to relax. â€œPrincesses shouldnâ€™t say the word â€˜bullshit.â€™ Itâ€™s terribly undiplomatic.â€
â€œDonâ€™t deflect. Rhysâ€¦â€ She angled her head toward the bodyguard, whose gunmetal glare darkened the longer he looked at me. â€œâ€¦caught him. It turns out itâ€™s a small world after all because they served in the military together. In fact, Rhys saved his life, so it didnâ€™t take much before he spilled. Now, I want you to explain why, exactly, youâ€™re having Ava followed. Havenâ€™t you done enough?â€
That fucker. No wonder the guy Iâ€™d hired had been avoiding my calls.
Navy SEAL of honor, my ass. Incompetency and disloyalty were a worldwide scourge.
â€œPerhaps you should check your facts because I did no such thing,â€ I said coolly. â€œDelusional much?â€
â€œDonâ€™t lie, Alex. Youâ€™re not as good at it as you think you are.â€ Bridget pierced me with her stare. â€œHe told us you ordered him to keep an eye on her. Not to harm herâ€¦but to protect her.â€
A familiar pressure built at the base of my neck and spread until it enveloped my skull in a crushing grip. â€œAnd you believed him?â€ I straightened my shirt sleeve. â€œDoesnâ€™t say much for your bodyguard that he would believe lies so easily. No wonder you got kidnapped.â€
A low growl emitted from said bodyguardâ€™s throat. He stepped forward, his eyes promising vengeance, but Bridget stayed him with a warning look.
â€œYouâ€™re deflecting again.â€ She relaxed, her hard expression melting into a thoughtful one that sent the hairs on the back of my neck rising. She slipped into Ralphâ€™s vacated chair and crossed one leg over the other.
â€œI didnâ€™t say you could sit.â€ I didnâ€™t give a flying fuck that she was a princess. This was my
 office. My
 kingdom.
Bridget ignored me.
Iâ€™d already picked up my phone to call security when she said, â€œYou secretly hired someone to look after Ava because you still care about her.â€
Why the fuck
 did everyone want to talk about her? Was it Torture Alex with Avaâ€™s Name day?
I slammed the phone down and stood. I was done with people today. The Vice-President could wait another day or week for our phone call. â€œI donâ€™t have time for this. Iâ€”â€
â€œStill care about her,â€ Bridget repeated.
â€œTake a pill for the delusion, princess. I used her. I got what I wanted. Now Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve been
 done for months.â€ I shrugged on my jacket. â€œNow fuck off.â€
â€œFor someone whoâ€™s usually so composed, youâ€™re awfully agitated,â€ she said. â€œI wonder why.â€
â€œHow about you mind your business, I mind mine.â€ I flicked my eyes toward Rhys, who glared back at me with dangerous gray eyes.
Bridget tensed. â€œWhatâ€™s that supposed to mean?â€
â€œYou know what it means.â€
â€œFine. Stay in denial.â€ Bridget stood, her complexion a shade paler than before. â€œI guess you donâ€™t want to know about Ava.â€
â€œWhat about Ava?â€ The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Shit.

A small, triumphant smile spread across Bridgetâ€™s face. Between her and Jules, â€œannoying as hellâ€ must be a requirement for Avaâ€™s friends.
â€œForget I said anything. You obviously donâ€™t care,â€ she said.
â€œJust tell me,â€ I gritted out.
â€œNot unless you admit it.â€
My blood pressure skyrocketed to alarming levels. I was this
 close to drop-kicking a princess, bodyguard be damned. â€œThereâ€™s nothing to tell.â€
â€œFor a supposed genius, you are dense
 .â€ Bridget somehow managed to look down her nose at me even though I was taller than her. â€œYou didnâ€™t hire someone to follow Ava all these months to protect her for no reason. To be clear, I despise you for what you did, and I donâ€™t want
 her to forgive you. But I love her more than I hate you, and she hasnâ€™t been the same since Philly.â€ A troubled expression crossed her face. â€œI didnâ€™t say anything at first because I thought you didnâ€™t care, but now that I know you doâ€”donâ€™t insult me by denying it again,â€ she said when I opened my mouth. â€œI may not have a MENSA-level IQ, but Iâ€™m not an idiot. I hate to admit it, but youâ€™re the only person with any hope of getting through to her. Iâ€™ve tried, Jules and Stella have tried, Josh has tried hard as he canâ€¦but itâ€™s not working.â€
I suppressed a flinch at the mention of Joshâ€™s name. â€œAvaâ€™s fine. Sheâ€™s healthy and thriving in school. Sheâ€™s even swimming on her own now.â€
There was no use pretending anymore. Bridget saw right through my bullshit.
â€œOn the outside, Ava is fine,â€ she said. â€œNot on the inside. Sheâ€™sâ€¦I donâ€™t know how to explain it. Itâ€™s like sheâ€™s missing the spark that makes her her.
 â€
I knew exactly what she meant, because Iâ€™d seen that spark die in front of my eyes.
I exhaled a ragged breath and tried to gather my swirling thoughts. They were usually crystal clear, each arranging themselves in the perfect pattern for me to analyze and strategize, but Iâ€™d barely slept over the past few months, and I hadnâ€™t eaten in almost twenty-four hours. I was a mess.
Iâ€™d been a mess since I let Ava go.
â€œI donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll forgive you for what you did,â€ Bridget said. â€œOr if I want
 her to forgive you. But itâ€™s not about me. Itâ€™s about her. Imagine how she must feel, finding out both her â€˜fatherâ€™ and her â€˜boyfriendâ€™ lied to her for so longâ€”and
 finding these things out at practically the same time. She says sheâ€™s over it, but you donâ€™t just â€˜get overâ€™ something like that.â€ She glared at me. â€œAt least tell her your true feelings. She doesnâ€™t trust herself right now, much less in love or other people. And an Ava who doesnâ€™t trust or believe in loveâ€¦well, thatâ€™s not really Ava, is it?â€
My heart twisted into a knot that blocked the air from my lungs. â€œ
 I canâ€™t.â€
â€œWhy not? You care about her. Perhapsâ€¦â€ She paused, her face contemplative as she examined my tight jaw and rigid frame. â€œYou even love her.â€
â€œGet out.â€
â€œYouâ€™re being a coward. I thought you werenâ€™t afraid of anything, yet youâ€™re afraid to tell her how you really feelâ€”â€
â€œBecause sheâ€™s better off without me, okay?â€ I exploded, months of pent-up emotion bursting forth in one giant, scalding wave.
Rhys stepped forward, but Bridget waved him back, those blue eyes trained on me with fascination. I didnâ€™t blame her. Iâ€™d never blown up like that in front of another person. Ever.
It was strangely cathartic.
â€œI couldnâ€™t protect her. She was hurt because of me.
 My uncle kidnapped her because of me.
 And I couldnâ€™t stop him.â€ I pressed my lips together, trying to calm my rampaging pulse.
Five months later, I still woke in the middle of the night, terrified something had happened to Ava. Envisioning all the things that couldâ€™ve
 happened to her had things gone sideways in my uncleâ€™s office. That was why Iâ€™d hired the private investigator-slash-bodyguardâ€”I couldnâ€™t look after her myself without putting her in more danger, but Iâ€™d be damned if I left her defenseless and alone out there.
Of course, I needed to fire the guy for not keeping his mouth shut, but this was D.C. There were ex-military and ex-Secret Service types everywhere.
Bridgetâ€™s expression softened. â€œYou saved her life.â€
â€œI was the one who put her in that situation in the first place,â€ I said bitterly. â€œPeople around me always get hurt, and for all I haveâ€â€”I swept my arm around my sprawling officeâ€”â€œI canâ€™t guarantee their safety.â€ I raked a frustrated hand through my hair, glad my office was soundproof and surrounded by tinted glass. The last thing I needed was for my staff to see me lose my shit.
â€œNothing in life is guaranteed, but youâ€™re Alex Volkov. Your uncle caught you off guard because he was your uncle, but now that heâ€™s out of the picture, do you really think anyone else can get the jump on you?â€ Bridget shook her head. â€œIf you do, then maybe it is best you stay away from Ava. Like I said, I despise what you did to her, but I also believe you love herâ€”even if youâ€™re too stubborn or stupid to see itâ€”â€
â€œI have an IQ of 160,â€ I said, insulted.
â€œIntellectual intelligence doesnâ€™t equal emotional intelligence,â€ she retorted. â€œAnd do not interrupt a princess. Itâ€™s terrible etiquette. As I was saying, youâ€™re too stubborn or stupid to see it, and now itâ€™s too late.â€
I paused, letting her words sink in. Dread uncoiled at the pit of my stomach. â€œExplain.â€
Bridget and Rhys exchanged glances before she responded in a wary tone. â€œAvaâ€™s moving to London. She switched her fellowship location. Her plane leaves inâ€â€”she checked the clockâ€”â€œan hour.â€

London.
 Another city, another country, another continent.
 She would be thousands of miles away from me.
Fuck. That.
The dread turned into full-blown panic. â€œFlight info,â€ I snarled.
â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
I wanted to strangle her. I didnâ€™t care that Rhys was packing heat and looked ready to tackle me if I so much as twitched the wrong way.
â€œI swear to God, Bridgetâ€”â€
â€œWhy do you want to know?â€ she demanded. â€œItâ€™s not like youâ€™ll go after her. You saidâ€”â€
â€œBecause I love her!â€ I slammed my hands on the table. â€œThere, happy? I love her so much I would rather give her up than hurt her. But if you think Iâ€™m letting her go to another country alone,
 with no protection, youâ€™ve got another think coming. Now give me her fucking flight info.â€
Bridget did, a spark of triumph gleaming in her eyes.
I was well aware sheâ€™d baited me, but I didnâ€™t care. All I cared about was getting to the airport in the next hourâ€”fuck, the next fifty-six minutes. I would figure everything else out laterâ€”Avaâ€™s protection, my enemies. For now, I just needed to see her. Hold her.
I brushed past Bridget and Rhys and stormed toward the elevator, ignoring Carolinaâ€™s startled jump.
â€œCancel my call with the VPâ€”send my sincerest apologies and tell him I had a last-minute emergencyâ€”and book me a ticket to Europe that leaves in the next three hours,â€ I commanded as I passed her. â€œDulles Airport.â€
â€œYou want me to cancel theâ€”â€
â€œDo it.
 â€
â€œCertainly, sir.â€ Carolina sprang into action, her fingers flying over her keyboard. â€œWhich city wouldâ€”â€
â€œDoesnâ€™t matter. Just do it.â€
â€œRight away, sir.â€
I only needed the ticket to get past security.
On a regular day, it took half an hour to reach the airport, but of course, today was the day every construction crew in D.C. showed up in full force. Roadblocks and closures littered the streets alongside a shitload of drivers determined to win the Worldâ€™s Slowest Driver award.
â€œGet out of my way,â€ I snapped at the Lexus in front of me. Jesus, does no one in this city know how to drive?

I broke what must have been a thousand traffic laws, but I made it to the airport in thirty-five minutes. Parking, securityâ€”fortunately, Carolina had the foresight to check me in onlineâ€”and I was through, racing through the terminal searching for Avaâ€™s gate number.
I felt like the worldâ€™s worst movie clichÃ©. Running through the airport trying to get the woman I loved to give me another chanceâ€¦how original. But if it got me to Ava in time, Iâ€™d do it in front of prime-time TV.
Ava and I hadnâ€™t spoken in months, but there remained a thread tying us together despite what happened in Philly. Something told me that if she were to get on that plane, that would change. Weâ€”or whatever was left of usâ€”would change. And I was terrified.
Beneath the fear, though, there lay a glimmer of pride. The girl whoâ€™d been afraid to go near water a year agoâ€”whoâ€™d dreamed of traveling the world but never thought sheâ€™d be able toâ€”was taking an international flight for the first time. Flying over an ocean. Facing her fears. I always knew she could do it, and she didnâ€™t need me or anyone else holding her hand.
I wondered if other people felt conflicting emotions like this every day. If so, I almost felt sorry for them. It was a pain in the fucking ass.
I dodged a mother with a stroller and a slow-moving group of students in obnoxious neon green T-shirts. The gate numbers whizzed by in a blur until I found the one I was looking for.
My stomach sank when I saw the empty seating area and closed door leading to the jetway.
â€œFlight 298. Did it leave?â€ I demanded of the attendant behind the counter.
â€œYes, Iâ€™m afraid the plane took off a few minutes ago, sir,â€ she said apologetically. â€œIf you would like to book another flightâ€”â€
I tuned her out, my heart beating a desperate, lonely rhythm in my chest.
The plane had left.
Ava was gone.

Ava






I loved London.

I loved its energy, the posh accents, and the anticipation that I might sight one of the royals any day. I didnâ€™t, but I could
 , though I reassured Bridget sheâ€™d always be my favorite royal. Most of all, I loved that it was a fresh start. No one knew me here. I could be whoever I wanted, and the creative spark Iâ€™d lost in those dark weeks after Philadelphia came rushing back.
Iâ€™d been nervous, moving to a city where I had zero connections, but the rest of the WYP fellows and instructors were great. After two weeks of living in London and attending workshops, Iâ€™d already formed a small group of friends. We celebrated happy hour at pubs, went on photoshoots together on the weekends, and did touristy stuff like ride the London Eye and cruise on the Thames.
I missed my friends and Josh, but we video-called often, and Bridget promised to visit me on her way back to Eldorra later this summer. Plus, all the WYP workshops and activities and the excitement of exploring a new city kept me busy. I didnâ€™t have time to be in my head, thank God.
Iâ€™d been in my head for months, and it wasnâ€™t a great place to be. I needed a change of scenery.
I also needed to send a big thank-you gift basket to the original London fellow whoâ€™d agreed to swap places with meâ€”she went to New York while I came here. It was the only way the program would let me change my location so late in the process, but it worked out.
â€œYou sure you canâ€™t join us?â€ Jack, an Australian wildlife photographer who was also in this yearâ€™s fellowship cohort, asked. â€œHalf-off drinks at The Black Boar today.â€
The Black Boar, located a few minutesâ€™ walk away from the WYP building, was one of the fellowsâ€™ favorite pubs.
I shook my head with a regretful smile. â€œNext time. Iâ€™m behind on editing photos.â€
I wanted to make sure the final products were top-notch because they werenâ€™t for any olâ€™ workshopâ€”they were for Diane Langeâ€™s. The
 Diane Lange. Iâ€™d nearly had a heart attack when I first met her in person. She was everything Iâ€™d imagined her to be and more. She was smart, incisive, and talented beyond belief. Tough, but fair. Her passion for her art radiated from every inch of her, and I could tell she cared about us. She wanted
 us to succeed and be the best we could be. In a cutthroat industry rife with backstabbing and undermining other creators, her dedication to helping us perfect our craft with no ego said a lot about her character.
â€œFair enough.â€ Jack chuckled. â€œSee ya tomorrow then.â€
â€œSee you.â€ I waved goodbye and rummaged through my bag for my headphones while walking down the steps. That was the downside of carrying a large bagâ€”it was impossible to find anything smaller than a full-sized laptop.
My fingers closed around the thin white wires right when I felt a prickle of heat on my neck. An electric awareness I hadnâ€™t felt in months.

No.

I was afraid to look up, but my curiosity got the better of me. My pulse quickened as I lifted my eyes slowly. Higherâ€¦higherâ€¦and there he was, standing less than three feet away in a black shirt and pants, looking like a god descended from the heavens to wreak havoc on my still-fragile heart.
I swore the poor thing stopped beating.
I hadnâ€™t seen him in person since Philadelphia, and the sight was too much. Too vivid, too overwhelming, too beautiful and horrifying. Those eyes, that face, the way I instinctively stepped toward him before I caught myselfâ€¦
Oxygen grew scarce. My chest tightened the way it used to when I was near water. I could feel a panic attack coming on, and I needed to leave before I collapsed right there on the sidewalk, but my feet wouldnâ€™t move.

This is a hallucination. It has to be.

That was the only explanation that made sense. Why else would Alex show up in London in front of my fellowship headquarters after half a year of silence?
I squeezed my eyes shut, counted to ten, and opened them again.
He was still here. In London. In front of me.

The panic intensified.
â€œHi,â€ he said softly.
I flinched at the sound of his voice. If looking at him was a punch in the gut, hearing him was like getting steamrolled by a Mack truck.
â€œYou canâ€™t be here.â€ It was a stupid thing to say since we were on a public sidewalk and it wasnâ€™t like I could ban him from the city of London, but oh, how I wished I could. I was already drowning in him, and itâ€™d been less than five minutes. â€œWhy are you here?â€
Alex stuffed his hands in his pockets, his throat flexing with a hard swallow. His eyes flickered with uncertainty as they searched my face for something I wasnâ€™t ready to give. In all the years Iâ€™d known him, Iâ€™d never seen him look so nervous. â€œIâ€™m here for you.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t need me anymore.â€ I almost couldnâ€™t hear myself over the thunderous roar of my pulse. I regretted the falafel sandwich I ate for lunch, which threatened to make a messy reappearance. â€œYou got your revenge, and Iâ€™m not interested in whatever new game youâ€™re playing. So leave. Me. Alone.â€
Pain slashed across his face. â€œThis isnâ€™t a game, I promise. This is just me, asking you forâ€¦not forgiveness, not right now. But hope that one day, you wonâ€™t hate me and we might get a second chance.â€ He swallowed hard. â€œIâ€™ll always need you, Sunshine.â€

Sunshine.
 The word tore at me, ripped off the scabs on my wounds until I bled once again.

Stop calling me Sunshine.


Why?


Because itâ€™s not my name.


Iâ€™m aware. Itâ€™s a nickname.

â€œYour promises mean nothing to me.â€ I wrapped my arms around myself, chilled to the bone even though the sun shone high in the sky. â€œEven if they did, theyâ€™re six months too late.â€
Iâ€™d lived less than a half-hourâ€™s drive from Alex all those months, and he never once reached out. Now, he showed up in another country asking for a second chance? Unbelievable.
Almost as unbelievable as the small, shameful part of me that wanted
 to give him that second chance.

Stay strong.
 Iâ€™d survived multiple murder attempts. I conquered my aquaphobia. I could talk to the man who broke my heart without falling apart.
Hopefully.
â€œI know.â€ Alex exhaled a shaky breath, his brows drawn tight over his eyes. He looked less polished than usual, with his rumpled hair and faint purple smudges beneath his eyes. I wondered if heâ€™d been getting enough sleep, then mentally kicked myself for caring. His sleeping habits werenâ€™t my business anymore. â€œI thought I was protecting you. That you were better off without me. After what happened with my uncle, I couldnâ€™t risk you getting hurt again because of your association with me. But I never left you alone. I had someone keeping an eye on youâ€”â€
â€œWait.â€ I held up one hand. â€œYou had me followed?
 â€
â€œFor your protection.â€
I couldnâ€™t believe it. â€œHow is that okay? Thatâ€™sâ€”thatâ€™s crazy! How longâ€¦oh my God.â€ My eyes widened. â€œDo you have someone following me in London, too?â€
He stared at me, his face stony.
â€œUnreal,â€ I breathed. â€œYou are truly psycho. Where is he?â€ I looked around frantically. I didnâ€™t see anyone suspect, but the most dangerous people were those who looked anything but. â€œCall him off. Right now.â€
â€œI already did.â€
I narrowed my eyes. That was too easy. â€œYou did?â€
â€œYes, because Iâ€™m taking over his duties. Thatâ€™s why it took me so long. I had to makeâ€¦arrangements for my absence in D.C.â€ Alexâ€™s mouth twitched at my stunned expression. â€œYouâ€™ll be seeing a lot more of me from now on.â€
â€œThe hell I will.â€ The thought of seeing him every day sent me into a tailspin of panic. â€œIâ€™ll file a restraining order against you. Have you arrested for stalking.â€
â€œYou can try, but I canâ€™t guarantee my friends in the British government will comply.â€ His face darkened. â€œAnd if you think Iâ€™m leaving you alone and unprotected anywhere,
 you donâ€™t know me at all.â€
â€œI donâ€™t
 know you. I have no idea who are you are. I only know the person you showed me, and he was an illusion. A fantasy.â€ Emotion clogged my throat. â€œI asked you that day if any of it had been real. You looked me in the eye and told me it was a lesson for the future. So, consider the lesson learned.â€
Alex flinched. â€œIt was
 real,â€ he said hoarsely. â€œAll of it.â€
I shook my head, my chest aching so hard it hurt to breathe. â€œI realize youâ€™re powerful enough that I canâ€™t stop you from doing what you want, but youâ€™re wasting your time if you think Iâ€™ll fall for your lies again.â€
â€œTheyâ€™re not lies. Sunshineâ€”â€
â€œDonâ€™t
 call me that!â€ I couldnâ€™t stem the tide of tears gathering in my eyes. Iâ€™d been doing so well, but every second in Alexâ€™s presence eroded the defenses Iâ€™d built around my heart until it lay naked and vulnerable once more. â€œYouâ€™ve ruined everything I once thought was beautiful. Sunshine. Love. Even freakinâ€™ red velvet cake, because it reminds me of you.
 And when I think of youâ€”â€ A sob ripped from my throat. â€œI think of every good memory we had and how theyâ€™re now tainted by the fact you were using me the whole time. I think of how stupid
 I was for falling for you and how you mustâ€™ve laughed at me when I told you I loved you. And I think of all those times you warned me about being too soft-hearted, but I ignored you because I believed the world was an inherently good place. Well, congratulations.â€ I brushed the tears from my cheeks, but they fell too fast for me to make much of a dent. Thank God most of my classmates had already left and the surrounding street was empty. â€œThat was the one truth you spoke. I was
 too soft-hearted, and the world is not the place I thought it was. Itâ€™s cruel and itâ€™s vicious, and thereâ€™s no place for soft hearts.â€
â€œSunâ€”Ava, no.â€ Alex reached for me, but I instinctively recoiled. Hurt filled his face. His hand curled into a fist that he stuffed back in his pocket, and the tendons in his neck stretched taut. I detected a tiny tremble in his shoulders as he spoke. â€œThat was what I believed because Iâ€™d never known anything else, but you showed me there is
 beauty in the world. I see it every time I look at you, or see you smile, or hear you laugh. You believe the best of people and thatâ€™s a strength, not a weakness. Donâ€™t let anyone, least of all me, take that away from you.â€ His eyes burned into mine, bright with pain. â€œYou told me once there was something beautiful waiting for me, something thatâ€™ll restore my faith in life. Iâ€™ve found it. Itâ€™s you.â€
I wanted to sink into his words until they became my reality, but Iâ€™d been burned before. Who knew what he wanted from me this time around?
â€œYou keep talking about protecting me,â€ I said. â€œBut you hurt me more than anyone else in my life, even Michael. Even when I thought you were an ass, I trusted you to tell the truth, and you turned out to be the biggest liar of all. Justâ€¦â€ I sucked in a deep breath, unable to look at him, it hurt so much. â€œLeave me alone.â€
Alexâ€™s chest heaved like he couldnâ€™t get enough air into his lungs. â€œI canâ€™t do that, sweetheart. Iâ€™ll wait however long it takes, but Iâ€™ll never be okay with a world in which youâ€™re alone.â€
â€œWho says I will be? Maybe Iâ€™ll find someone else.â€
His eyes darkened into a furious shade of emerald, and his shoulders tensed even more. Somewhere, thunder boomed. I hadnâ€™t noticed the weather morph from sunny to its current gray, gloomy state, but I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if Alex had the power to control it with his emotions. â€œThe hell you will,â€ he snarled. â€œIâ€™ll kill any man that touches you.â€
â€œYou have no right,â€ I hissed back. â€œI donâ€™t belong to you.â€
The muscles in his jaw popped. â€œThatâ€™s where youâ€™re wrong. I fucked up. Massively. But I will earn your forgiveness one day, and you are
 mine. Always. No matter how much time or distance separate us.â€

Do you know what it means to be taken by me? It means youâ€™re mine.

I shoved aside the unbidden memory. â€œIâ€™m not arguing with you any longer.â€ There was no way I could focus on editing tonight, but at least I could go home and cry myself to sleep like a pathetic moron. Yay me. â€œYou can waste your time in London, but it wonâ€™t matter. Weâ€™re done.â€
I walked away before Alex could respond. Undeterred, he followed me, his every step matching two of mine. Dammit.
 Why couldnâ€™t I have been born tall like Bridget or Stella?
I ducked my head and picked up my pace, trying to ignore the man beside me as drops of rain splashed on my face and dampened my hair.
â€œAva, please.â€
I clutched my bag to my chest, using it as armor while I bulldozed my way down the sidewalk.
â€œAt least let me drive you home,â€ Alex pleaded. â€œItâ€™s not safe, walking in the dark.â€
Iâ€™d been walking home for the past two weeks and had no issues. I didnâ€™t live in the best neighborhood, but it wasnâ€™t a war zone. I just had to keep my wits about me. Plus, I had pepper spray, and Iâ€™d restarted self-defense lessons at a local martial arts center.
I didnâ€™t say any of that to Alex though.
â€œItâ€™s cold and raining, and youâ€™re wearing a dress.â€ No matter how fast I walked, I couldnâ€™t shake him. â€œSweetheart, please, youâ€™ll get sick.â€ His voice broke on the last word.
I clenched my teeth so hard my jaw hurt. I kept my head low, desperate to reach the warm safety of my flat. Eventually, Alex stopped talking and simply walked beside me, a glowering presence who ensured everyone else gave me a wide berth.
After what felt like an eternity, we reached my building. I didnâ€™t look at him as I fished my key out of my bag and jammed it into the lock. Water streaked my faceâ€”from the rain or my tears, I couldnâ€™t tell.
Alex didnâ€™t follow me inside the building, but I could feel the heat of his gaze as I slipped inside.

Donâ€™t look. Donâ€™t look.

I made it halfway up the stairs before I caved. The glass pane above the door provided a clear view of the sidewalk, and although I was already in the building, Alex remained outside, soaked to the bone. His shirt clung to his sculpted torso, and his hair plastered to his forehead, the light brown color almost black from the rain. He lifted his eyes until they met mine through the glass, his face stamped with equal parts anguish and determination.
And even though concrete, metal, and a good dozen feet separated us, he exerted a magnetic pull that almost convinced me to fling open the door and pull him in from the cold.
Almost.
I forced myself to turn away and run up the rest of the stairs to my flat before my stupid, soft heart got me in trouble again. Even after I changed and stepped into the shower, shivering, its seductive whispers caressed my ears and urged me to give in.

Ask him to come in. Itâ€™s dark and cold outsideâ€¦What if he gets sick? Robbed? Hurt?

â€œHe wonâ€™t,â€ I said out loud, scrubbing my skin so hard it turned red. â€œAlex Volkov doesnâ€™t get hurt. He does
 the hurting.â€
The image of him standing miserably in the rain flashed through my mind, and I faltered before scrubbing harder. I didnâ€™t make
 him follow me or stand out there. If he caught a cold orâ€¦or hypothermia, that was on him.
I switched off the water with shaky hands.
I spent the next few hours eating instant ramen and attempting to edit photos, but I eventually gave up. I couldnâ€™t focus, and my eyes ached from crying. I just wanted to pretend this afternoon never happened.
I called it an early night and climbed into bed, resisting the urge to look out the window. Itâ€™d been hours. It wasnâ€™t like Alex would still be out there.

Alex lived
 up to his promise-slash-threat of showing up every. Single. Day. He was there in the morning when I left for my fellowship, usually with a vanilla latte and blueberry sconeâ€”my favorites. He was there to walk me home after my workshops. Other times, especially when I was with other people or exploring the city on the weekends, he was less conspicuous, but he was there. I felt his presence even though I couldnâ€™t see him.
I never thought Alex Volkov would become my stalker, but there we were.
On top of that, gifts arrived every day. By the boatload.
By the end of the first week, my apartment looked like I was opening an indoor garden. I donated everything to a local hospitalâ€”the roses of every color, the vivid purple orchids and sweet white lilies, the cheerful sunflowers and delicate peonies.
By the end of the second week, I owned enough jewelry to make the Duchess of Cambridge green with envyâ€”at least, until I pawned them. The sum I received for the pile of diamond earrings, sapphire bracelets and ruby necklaces made my eyes water, but I donated most of it to various charities and saved the rest for living expenses. London wasnâ€™t cheap, and the fellowship stipend wasnâ€™t exactly princely.
By the end of the third week, I was knee-deep in gourmet chocolates, gift baskets, and custom-made desserts.
I didnâ€™t care about fancy jewels or flowers, so those gifts didnâ€™t matter to me. It was the little things that tore holes in my heartâ€”the red velvet cupcakes that spelled out Iâ€™m Sorry
 ; a rare, vintage Japanese camera Iâ€™d searched for for years but had never found for sale; the framed photo of Alex and me at the fall festival. I hadnâ€™t realized heâ€™d kept a copy from the photo booth.

Why would I need photos?


For the memories. To remember people and events?


I donâ€™t need photos for that.

By the end of the fourth week, I was torn between tearing my hair out in frustration and crumbling like a sandcastle at high tide.
â€œWe need to talk,â€ I said Friday afternoon after I left my lighting techniques workshop. Alex lounged against a light pole outside the building, infuriatingly gorgeous in jeans and a white T-shirt. Aviators hid his eyes, but the intensity of his gaze seared through the glasses and burned into my flesh.
A group of passing schoolgirls looked him over, giggling and whispering amongst themselves.
â€œHe is so hot,
 â€ I heard one of them squeal when she thought she was out of earshot.
Spoiler: she wasnâ€™t.
I wished I could run after her and give her some unsolicited big-sister advice. Donâ€™t fall for guys who look like they could break your heart because chances are, they will.

â€œSure,â€ Alex said, unfazed by the girlsâ€™ attention. He was probably used to it. While he followed me around London, women followed him
 around until we all looked like we were playing a giant game of Follow the Leader. â€œWe can talk over dinner.â€ His mouth twitched when I glared at him.
â€œThatâ€™s not happening.â€ I looked around and spotted a tiny alcove further down the street. Not quite an alleyway, but private enough. I didnâ€™t want the other fellows seeing him and asking more questions. Most had already noticed Alex waiting for me every day and incorrectly assumed he was my boyfriend. â€œOver there.â€
I marched toward the alcove and waited until we were ensconced in the tiny space before I spoke again. â€œYou have to stop.â€
Alex raised an eyebrow. â€œStop...?â€
â€œThe gifts. The waiting. The games. They wonâ€™t work.â€ Lies.
 They were close to working, which was why I was freaking out. If he kept this up, I didnâ€™t know how long I could hold out.
His smile faded. â€œI told you, Iâ€™m not playing games. If you want me to stop with the gifts, Iâ€™ll stop. But Iâ€™ll never stop waiting.â€
â€œWhy?â€ I threw my hands up in frustration. â€œYou can have any woman you want. Why
 are you still here?â€
â€œBecause none of them are you. Iâ€¦â€ Alexâ€™s throat flexed with a hard swallow. The nervous expression returned. â€œI didnâ€™t want to admit it, even to myself, butâ€”â€
â€œNo.â€ My heart broke into a gallop. I knew what he would say next, and I was nowhere near ready to hear it. â€œDonâ€™t.â€
â€œAva, I love you.â€ His eyes flickered with emotion, and my chest squeezed until I thought it would burst. â€œWhen you told me you loved me, I didnâ€™t say it back because I didnâ€™t feel like I deserved your love. You didnâ€™t know the truth about my plan yet, and I didnâ€™t thinkâ€¦fuck.â€ He rubbed the back of his neck, looking uncharacteristically flustered. â€œThis wasnâ€™t how Iâ€™d planned to say it,â€ he muttered. â€œBut itâ€™s true. And maybe I still donâ€™t deserve you, but Iâ€™m willing to work at it until I do.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t love me.â€ I shook my head, my eyes and nose burning with unshed tears. Iâ€™d cried so much lately I annoyed myself, but I couldnâ€™t stop. â€œYou donâ€™t even know what love is. You lied and used me and Josh for eight years. Eight years.
 Thatâ€™s not love. Thatâ€™s manipulation. Insanity.â€
â€œIt started out that way, but Josh really did become my best friend, and I really did fall for you.â€ Alex let out a short laugh. â€œYou think I wanted
 those things to happen? I didnâ€™t. They completely screwed my plans over. I held off on bringing down Michael for years because of you and Josh.â€
â€œHow generous of you,â€ I said sarcastically.
His jaw tightened. â€œI never claimed to be Prince Charming, and my love isnâ€™t a fairy tale type of love. Iâ€™m a fucked-up person with fucked-up morals. I wonâ€™t write you poems or serenade you beneath the moonlight. But you are the only
 woman I have eyes for. Your enemies are my enemies, your friends are my friends, and if you wanted, I would burn down the world for you.â€
My heart split in half. I wanted so badly to believe him, butâ€¦ â€œEven if thatâ€™s true, itâ€™s not about love. Itâ€™s about trust, and I donâ€™t trust you anymore. You proved youâ€™re the master of the long game. What if this is just another one of those? What if one day, ten years from now, I wake up and you break my heart again? I wonâ€™t survive it a second time.â€
If the source of the heartbreak were anyone else, maybe. But not Alex. He was embedded not only in my heart but in my soul, and if I lost him again for whatever reason, it was game over.
â€œAva.â€ Alexâ€™s voice cracked. Red rimmed his eyes, and I couldâ€™ve sworn he was on the verge of crying. But this was Alex. He didnâ€™t cry. He wasnâ€™t capable of it. â€œSweetheart, please. Tell me what I have to do. Iâ€™ll do anything.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s anything you can do,â€ I whispered. â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€
â€œThen Iâ€™ll just have to try everything until we find something,â€ he said, his face granite, his tone resolute.
Alex wouldnâ€™t give up until he got what he wanted. It wasnâ€™t in his nature. But if I gave in to him the way my heart wanted but my mind screamed at me not to, how could I live with myself? A relationship without trust was built on a foundation of sand, and after a lifetime of drifting, I needed solid ground.
â€œGo home to D.C., Alex,â€ I said, exhaustedâ€”mentally, physically, and emotionally. â€œYou have a business to run.â€ Even as I said the words, my stomach lurched at the thought of an ocean separating us again.
I was a mess. I had no clue what I wanted, my thoughts raced too fast for me to latch onto any of them, andâ€”
â€œI resigned as CEO, effective one month ago.â€
That shocked me out of my reverie. â€œWhat
 ?â€ He was the most ambitious person I knew, and heâ€™d been CEO for less than a year.
Why hadnâ€™t I heard about this? Then again, I didnâ€™t follow financial news, and Iâ€™d avoided any news about Alex himself.
Alex shrugged. â€œI couldnâ€™t stay on as CEO while spending all my time in London with you, so I resigned,â€ he said matter-of-factly, like he hadnâ€™t given up his lifeâ€™s work on a whim. Except Alex did nothing on a whim. He thought through every move, and his latest one made no sense. Not unlessâ€¦
I squashed the brief flare of hope before it could blossom into something greater.
â€œBut what about money and expenses?â€ I realized how dumb that question was the second I asked it.
Alexâ€™s mouth tilted up. â€œI have enough in stocks, investments, and savings to last me the rest of my life. I worked because I wanted to. But now, I want to do something else.â€
I swallowed, my pulse thundering. â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€
â€œWin you back. No matter how long it takes.â€

The fellowship ended
 with a grand exhibition attended by the movers and shakers of Londonâ€™s art world. The exhibition took place in Shoreditch, and every fellow had their own section in the pop-up gallery.
It was exhilarating, nerve-wracking, and utterly surreal.
I stared at my little slice of heaven and the people passing through it, dressed to the nines and examining each piece with what I hoped were admiring eyes.
Iâ€™d grown by leaps and bounds as a photographer over the past year, and while I still had a lot to learn, I was damn proud of my work. I specialized in travel portraits like Diane Lange, but I put my personal spin on it. As much as I admired her, I didnâ€™t want to be
 her; I wanted to be my own person, with my own vision and creative ideas.
I took most of my shots in London, but the good thing about Europe was how easy it was to travel to other countries. On the weekends, I took the Eurostar to Paris or day trips to the Cotswolds. I even booked short flights to neighboring countries like Ireland and the Netherlands and didnâ€™t freak out on the plane.
My favorite piece was a portrait of two old men playing chess at a park in Paris. One had his head tossed back in laughter with a cigarette in hand while the other examined the board with a furrowed brow. The emotions from both jumped out from the photo, and Iâ€™d never been prouder.
â€œHow do you feel?â€ Diane came up beside me. Her pale blonde hair brushed her shoulders, and her black-rimmed glasses matched her black jacket and pants combo. Sheâ€™d been the best mentor I could ask for during the fellowship, and now I considered her both a friend and role model.
Me, friends with Diane Lange.

Surreal.

â€œI feelâ€¦everything,â€ I admitted. â€œWarning though, I might also throw up.â€
She threw her head back and laughed, not unlike the man in the photo. That was one of my favorite things about Diane. Whether it was joy, sadness, or anger, she expressed her emotions fully and without reserve. She poured herself into the world with the confidence of someone who refused to hold herself back to make others comfortable, and she shone all the brighter for it.
â€œThatâ€™s normal,â€ she said, her eyes twinkling. â€œI actually did
 throw up during my first exhibition. Puked all over a server and a guest who happened to be one of Parisâ€™s premier art collectors. I was mortified, but he was a good sport about it. Ended up buying two of my pieces that night.â€
I chewed on my bottom lip. That was another thing. All the fellowsâ€™ photos were up for sale tonight. My cohort had turned it into a competition to see who could sell the most and therefore boast they were â€œthe best,â€ but I would be happy if I sold one.

Knowing that someone, anyone, liked my work enough to pay for it sent a swarm of happy jitters through my stomach.
â€œI hope Iâ€™ll have as good a night,â€ I said, because I hadnâ€™t sold anything yet.

The twinkle in Dianeâ€™s eyes intensified. â€œYou already have. Better, in fact.â€
I tilted my head in confusion.
â€œSomeone bought all your pieces. Every single one.â€
I almost choked on my champagne. â€œWh-what?â€ The exhibition started an hour ago. How was that possible?

â€œSeems like you have an admirer.â€ She winked. â€œDonâ€™t look so surprised. Your work is good. Really good.â€
I didnâ€™t care how good my work was; I was an unknown name. A newbie. Newbies donâ€™t sell out of their entire collection that fast unlessâ€¦
My heart thumpedâ€”in warning or excitement, I wasnâ€™t sure.
I glanced frantically around the gallery, searching for thick brown hair and cool green eyes.
Nothing.
But he was here. He was my anonymous buyer. I felt it in my gut.
Alex and I had developed a newâ€¦well, I wasnâ€™t sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago. He still waited for me in front of my flat every morning and walked me home after my workshops every afternoon. Sometimes we talked, sometimes we didnâ€™t. He helped me practice my self-defense moves, assembled my new dining table after my old one broke, and served as a de facto assistant on some of my photoshoots. It had taken a long
 time before we reached that point, but weâ€™d gotten there.
He was trying. More than trying. And while Iâ€™d regained a modicum of trust in him, something held me back from fully forgiving him. I could see how much it hurt him every time I pushed him away, but the wounds from his and Michaelâ€™s betrayalsâ€”while they were
 healingâ€”ran deep, and I was still learning to trust myself, much less other people.
Josh, whoâ€™d graduated med school last month, had visited a few times, and I made Alex stay out of sight while he was in town. Josh was still furious with Alex, and I didnâ€™t need them getting into a fistfight in the middle of London. Jules, Bridget, and Stella had visited too. I hadnâ€™t told them about Alex, but I had a hunch Bridget knew something was upâ€”sheâ€™d kept looking at me with a knowing glint in her eyes.
Microphone feedback rippled through the air, and the crowd quieted. The fellowship director walked on stage and thanked everyone for attending, she hoped they were having a good time, blah blah blah. I tuned her out, too intent on my search to pay attention.

Where was he?

Alex wasnâ€™t one to hide in the shadows unless he didnâ€™t want to be seen, and I couldnâ€™t think of any reason heâ€™d want to lie low tonight.
â€œâ€¦special performance. Please put your hands together for Alex Volkov!â€
This was maddening. Had somethingâ€”wait, what?

My head snapped up, and my stomach tumbled into freefall.
There he was. Black tuxedo, unreadable expression, his hair gleaming golden brown beneath the lights. There were almost two hundred people in the room, but his eyes found mine immediately.
My pulse thumped with anticipation.

What was he doing onstage?

I got my answer a minute later.
â€œI realize this is quite a surprise, as a live performance wasnâ€™t in the program tonight,â€ Alex said. â€œAnd if you know me, you know Iâ€™m not famous for my patronage of the artsâ€”or my singing skills.â€ Soft laughter rippled through the crowd, along with a few knowing looks. Alex waited for the chuckles to die down before he continued, his gaze burning into mine. â€œWhether itâ€™s music, photography, film, or painting, the arts reflect the world around us, and for too long, I only saw the dark side. The seedy underbellies, the ugly truths. Photographs reminded me of moments in time that never lasted. Songs reminded me that words have the power to rip oneâ€™s heart out. Why, then, would I care about art when it was so terrible and destructive?â€ It was a bold statement to make in front of Londonâ€™s art world, but no one heckled. No one so much as breathed. Alex had us all under the spell of his words. â€œThen someone came into my life and upended everything I thought I knew. She was everything I wasnâ€™tâ€”pure-hearted, trusting, optimistic. She showed me the beauty that existed in this world, and through her, I learned the power of faith. Joy. Love. But Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve tainted her with my untruths, and Iâ€™m hoping, with all of my heart, that one day sheâ€™ll find her way out of the darkness and into the light again.â€
The room rang with breathless silence at the end of Alexâ€™s speech. My heart was pounding, pounding so hard I felt it in my throat. My stomach. My toes. I felt it in every inch of me.
Then he opened his mouth again, and my heart stopped altogether. Because the voice that came out and filled the room? It was the most beautiful thing Iâ€™d ever heard.
It wasnâ€™t just me, eitherâ€”everyone stared at Alex with rapt fascination, and I was pretty sure a few of the women straight-up swooned.
I pressed my fist to my mouth as the lyrics flowed over me. It was a song about love and heartbreak. Betrayal and redemption. Regret and forgiveness. Each word tore me apart, as did the fact that Alex sang at all. No matter how much Iâ€™d cajoled or begged in the past, it was the one thing heâ€™d refused to do.
Until now.
I understood why heâ€™d refused. Alex didnâ€™t just sing, he sang.
 With emotion, with beauty, with so much rawness it took my breath away. He bared his soul with each note, and for a man who thought his soul was irrevocably damned, the thought of doing that in front of an audience mustâ€™ve been unbearable.
Alex finished to thunderous applause. His gaze lingered on mine for one long moment before he disappeared offstage, and the crowd broke up into excited chatter and gasps.
My feet moved before I could think, but I only made it two steps before Diane stopped me.
â€œAva, before you leave, thereâ€™s someone I want you to meet,â€ she said. â€œThe editor of World Geographic
 is here, and theyâ€™re always looking for talented young photographers.â€
â€œIâ€”okay.â€ I looked around, but I didnâ€™t see Alex anywhere.
â€œIs everything all right? You seem distracted.â€ Diane examined me with concern. â€œYouâ€™ve been talking about World Geographic
 all year. I thought youâ€™d be more excited.â€
â€œYes, Iâ€™m fine. Sorry, Iâ€™m just a little overwhelmed.â€ Normally, I wouldâ€™ve fangirled at the thought of meeting the editor of World Geographic,
 a travel and culture magazine famous for its stunning photographs and storytelling, but all I could think about was Alex.
â€œThat was quite a performance, huh?â€ Diane grinned as she led me toward an older man with silver-streaked hair and a thick beard. Laurent Boucher. I recognized him immediately. â€œIf I were twenty years youngerâ€¦â€
I forced a weak laugh.
â€œNot that it would do me much good. He seemed to only have eyes for you.â€ She winked at me.
Heat rose on my face, and I mumbled an incoherent response before we reached Laurent.
â€œDiane, good to see you again.â€ Laurentâ€™s deep voice rumbled with a charming French accent as he air-kissed her. â€œYou look lovely as always.â€
â€œYouâ€™re always such a charmer.â€ Diane inclined her head toward me. â€œLaurent, I want you to meet Ava. Sheâ€™s the fellow I was telling you about.â€
â€œAh, of course.â€ Laurent turned his piercing dark eyes on me. â€œI was talking to Diane about your exhibit earlier this evening. Youâ€™re quite talentedâ€”young still, and your work could use a little more refinement, but you have extraordinary potential.â€
â€œThank you, sir.â€ Between Alexâ€™s performance and praise from Laurent freakinâ€™ Boucher, this whole evening was surreal.
â€œPlease, call me Laurent.â€
We chatted for another fifteen minutes, during which Diane excused herself to speak with the fellowship director. At the end of our conversation, Laurent handed me his card and told me to be in touch if I was interested in freelancing for a junior role at World Geographic
 . Um, yes
 . I was over the moon about the opportunity, but I couldnâ€™t help breathing a sigh of relief when Laurent got distracted by another acquaintance.
I thanked him and left to search for Alex, but I was interrupted again
 by a group of fellows who heard Iâ€™d already sold my entire collection and wanted to know who the buyer was. I told them I didnâ€™t know, which was technically true.
That kept happening the entire evening. Iâ€™d end one conversation only to get drawn into another. I was grateful for all the people who wanted to connect and congratulate me, but dammit, Alex was the only person I wanted to talk to.
By the end of the night, I hadnâ€™t caught a single glimpse of him since his performance. My feet hurt, my cheeks ached from constant smiling, and my stomach growled from the lack of food. I was always too nervous to eat at events.
Guests trickled out until I was one of only a handful of people left in the gallery, including the cleanup crew.
I couldnâ€™t believe Alex would leave without a word after what he did, but there was no denying itâ€”he wasnâ€™t here.
â€œHey, Ava.â€
I perked up, but disappointment slammed into me a second later when I saw who the speaker was.
â€œHey, Jack.â€ I fixed another smile on my face. â€œI thought you left.â€
â€œNah. Seems Iâ€™m a straggler, just like you.â€ His blue eyes twinkled. â€œYou wanna grab a bite? I couldnâ€™t eat a thing all night. Nerves,â€ he explained.
â€œI feel that.â€
â€œNerves? Câ€™mon, you sold your entire collection.
 Thatâ€™s incredible! Unheard of in WFP history.â€ Jack hugged me. â€œWe should celebrate. Maybe with a proper dinner and drinks? Doesnâ€™t have to be tonight if youâ€™re too tired,â€ he added.
I blinked, sure Iâ€™d read his tone wrong. â€œAre youâ€¦asking me out?â€
Jack had become a good friend over the past year, and I enjoyed hanging out with him. He wasnâ€™t unattractive either, with his longish blond hair, Australian accent, and sun-kissed surfer vibes. But when I looked at him, my stomach didnâ€™t flutter and my heart didnâ€™t skip a beat.
Only one person in the world could make me feel that way, and he wasnâ€™t here.
Jack blushed. â€œYeah.â€ He flashed a sheepish smile. â€œIâ€™ve wanted to ask you out for a while, but I didnâ€™t want to make things awkward during the fellowship. Since the program is over now, I figured, why not? Youâ€™re beautiful, funny, talented, and we get along well.â€ He paused. â€œI think.â€
â€œWe do.â€ I placed a hand on his arm. â€œYouâ€™re one of my closest friends here, and Iâ€™m so glad I met you. Youâ€™re a great guyâ€”â€
â€œOuch.â€ Jack winced. â€œI feel like thatâ€™s not a good thing when used in this context.â€
I laughed. â€œNo, trust me, itâ€™s a good thing. Youâ€™re cute and funny and talented too, and any girl would be lucky to date you.â€
â€œI sense a but coming,â€ he said wryly.
â€œButâ€”â€
â€œBut sheâ€™s busy,â€ a smooth voice interrupted. â€œFrom tonight through the foreseeable future.â€
I turned, my pulse accelerating when I saw Alex standing less than five feet away. His gaze zeroed in on where I was still touching Jackâ€™s arm. I pulled away, but it was too late. I could practically taste the danger pulsing in the air.
Gone was the man whoâ€™d bared his soul onstage; in his place was the ruthless CEO who wouldnâ€™t hesitate to crush his enemies into dust.
â€œYouâ€™re the guy who performed tonight and is always waiting for Ava outside WYP.â€ Jack narrowed his eyes. â€œWho are you again?â€
â€œSomeone who will rip your entrails out and strangle you with them if you donâ€™t take your hands off her,â€ Alex said in a deceptively calm voice.
It was only then that I realized Jack still had his hand on the small of my back from when heâ€™d hugged me earlier.
â€œYouâ€™re psycho.â€ Jack tightened his hold on me, and I suddenly feared for his life. â€œIâ€™m calling securityâ€”â€
â€œNo, itâ€™s fine. I know him,â€ I blurted before Jack could get himself into more trouble. â€œHeâ€™s, uh, prone to hyperbole.â€ I took a step back, forcing Jack to release me. â€œI need to talk to him, but Iâ€™ll see you later, okay?â€
He shot me a disbelieving look. â€œAva, heâ€™sâ€”â€
â€œIâ€™ll be fine,â€ I said, my tone firm. â€œI promise. Heâ€™s an old, um, acquaintance from D.C.â€
Displeasure radiated from Alex in waves. His gaze bore into me with laser intensity, but I ignored it the best I could.
â€œOkay.â€ Jack relented. â€œText me when youâ€™re home safe.â€ He kissed my cheek, and a low growl filled the room.
Jack flinched and cast another suspicious glance toward Alex before leaving.
I waited until he was out of earshot before I pinned Alex with my own warning stare. â€œDonâ€™t even think about it.â€
â€œThink about what?â€
â€œDoing anything to Jack. Or hiring anyone to do anything to him,â€ I added, because one always needed to cover oneâ€™s bases with Alex. He was the king of loopholes.
â€œI didnâ€™t realize you cared so much about him,â€ Alex said, his voice cold.
I clenched my teeth. â€œHow is it possible youâ€™re the same guy who sang earlier tonight? One is an asshole, the other isâ€¦â€
â€œIs what?â€ Alex walked toward me, and my mouth dried. â€œIs what, Ava?â€
â€œYou know what.â€
â€œI donâ€™t.â€
I exhaled a shaky sigh. â€œYou sang. In public.â€
â€œYes.â€
â€œWhy?â€
â€œWhy do I do anything these days?â€ He brushed his fingers over my cheek, and shivers of pleasure skated down my spine. â€œIâ€”â€ He paused, his jaw working before he said carefully, â€œIâ€™m not the best at expressing my emotions. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve never liked singing. Itâ€™s all emotion, and it feels too vulnerable. I canâ€™t stand it. But I said Iâ€™m willing to do whatever it takes to win you back, and I meant it, just as I meant every word in that song. That song was for you. But Iâ€™m running out of ideas, sweetheart.â€ Alex rubbed his thumb over the curve of my jaw and gave me a sad smile. â€œDo you know this is the first time youâ€™ve let me touch you in over a year?â€
I opened my mouth to argue because that couldnâ€™t possibly be trueâ€¦except it was. A montage of images flashed through my mind of me shrinking back or turning away every time Alex reached for me over the past twelve months. Not because I didnâ€™t want
 him to touch me, but because I didnâ€™t trust myself not to cave if he got that close again. He never said anything, but Iâ€™d caught the hurt and pain in his eyes.
â€œI looked for you after,â€ I said, my chin wobbling. â€œI couldnâ€™t find you. You disappeared.â€
â€œItâ€™s your big night. I didnâ€™t want to take that away from you.â€
â€œI thought you left.â€ I didnâ€™t know why, but I started crying. The tears dripped down my cheeks, and my sniffles echoed in the empty gallery. I was mortified, but at least we were the only people there. There had to be staff somewhere in the building or they wouldâ€™ve kicked us out, but I couldnâ€™t see them.
â€œI would never leave you.â€ Alex drew me into his chest, and I sank into his embrace for the first time in what felt like forever. It was like returning home after a long, lonely trip abroad. Iâ€™d forgotten how safe I felt in his arms, like nothing and no one could hurt me. That I felt this way even after what he did spoke volumes. â€œDo you want
 me to leave?â€ he asked gruffly.
I buried my face in his chest and shook my head. He smelled like warmth and spice, and it was so familiar it made my heart hurt.
I missed it. I missed him.
 Even though Iâ€™d seen Alex every day for the past year, it wasnâ€™t the same as touching him and actually being
 with him.
â€œDo you miss me, sweetheart?â€ His voice gentled.
I nodded, my face still buried in his chest.
All this time, Iâ€™d been afraid to let him back in, partly because I didnâ€™t trust him, but mostly because I didnâ€™t trust myself. After being lied to for so long by two people Iâ€™d loved, Iâ€™d begun to think of my heart as my enemy and not my friend. How could I trust my instincts when theyâ€™d led me so astray in the past?
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I hadnâ€™t
 been wrong. Iâ€™d thought Michael was my real father and that heâ€™d saved my life, but Iâ€™d always felt uncomfortable around him. I never bonded with him the way a daughter should with her father. I figured it was because heâ€™d been uncomfortable around me,
 and while that may have played a part, it had mostly been a sixth sense that warned me not to get too close.
As for Alex, heâ€™d pulled the wool over both my and Joshâ€™s eyes. But in my heart of hearts, I believed him when he said our relationship and his feelings were real.
Was there a chance I was wrong, and this was yet another fucked-up long game? Yes, though I didnâ€™t see what else he could want from me. Heâ€™d targeted Michael based on false information, and even if he hadnâ€™t, Michael was already out of the pictureâ€”heâ€™d been found guilty of multiple charges of attempted murder and corporate fraud, and he faced life in prison.
But Iâ€™d rather take a leap of faith than spend the rest of my life living in fear of something that might
 happen. I was sick and tired of letting my fears hold me back, whether it was over water, heartbreak, or something else.
The only way to live life was to live
 it. No fears, regrets.
Alex pulled back but kept one arm around my waist. He tilted my chin up, his eyes boring into mine. â€œDo you want me to stay?â€
He wasnâ€™t talking about the gallery, and we both knew it.
I swallowed hard and nodded again. â€œYes,â€ I whispered.
The word had barely left my mouth before Alex yanked me toward him and crushed his lips to mine. It wasnâ€™t a sweet, leisurely kiss. It was fierce and desperate and everything I needed. A shudder of relief rippled through him beneath my palms, and I hadnâ€™t realized how tense heâ€™d been until now.
â€œYou know thereâ€™s no getting rid of me now,â€ he warned, his touch hot and possessive as he gripped my hands.
â€œThat wouldnâ€™t have happened, anyway.â€
He let out a soft chuckle. â€œNow youâ€™re getting it.â€
His mouth claimed mine once more, and I was so lost in his kiss, his scent, his touch that I didnâ€™t notice weâ€™d moved until my back hit the wall.
â€œAlex?â€
â€œHmm?â€ He pulled my bottom lip between his teeth and bit lightly before chasing away the sting with his tongue. Full-on tingles spread from my scalp all the way down to my toes.
â€œDonâ€™t break my heart again.â€
Alexâ€™s face softened. â€œI wonâ€™t. Trust me, sweetheart.â€
â€œI do.â€ It was the truth. Iâ€™d seen the real Alex tonight, stripped of all his masks, and I trusted him with all my heart.
He gave me one of his real smiles then, the kind that could start a nuclear reaction and destroy the entire female population in one fell swoop.
â€œAlso, Iâ€¦â€ I blushed. â€œI miss when you call me Sunshine.â€
Alexâ€™s eyes flared with heat. â€œYeah?â€ He slid my skirt up, inch by inch, until the cool air hit my ass and upper thighs. â€œWhat else do you miss?â€ He dipped his hand inside my already-drenched panties and brushed the sensitive nub between my legs. â€œDo you miss this?â€
A whimper escaped. â€œYes.â€
â€œWhat about this?â€ He pressed his body against mine until I felt his rock-hard erection against my thigh. Heat sizzled through my veins. I hadnâ€™t had sex in a year and a half, and my sexual frustration was a volcano waiting to explode.
â€œYes. Please,â€ I moaned.
â€œI told the rest of the staff to leave before I came to see you. Itâ€™s just you and me, Sunshine.â€ His breath tickled my skin as he dragged his mouth down my neck until he reached the pulse fluttering wildly at the base of my throat. â€œIâ€™m going to fuck you against this wall until you canâ€™t remember your own name, but before I doâ€”â€ He grabbed my throat, his voice dropping to a soft snarl. My core spasmed in response. â€œTell me about the blond fucker who asked you out. Did you let him touch you, Sunshine? Did you let him touch what was mine?â€
I shook my head, practically panting from arousal.
Alexâ€™s grip tightened. â€œAre you lying to save him?â€
â€œNo,â€ I moaned. â€œI swear. I donâ€™t think of him that way.â€
I gasped when he spun me around and pressed my cheek against the wall. The icy concrete dug into my heated skin, and my nipples hardened into painful points.
Alex yanked up my skirt and shoved aside my panties with his free hand. â€œYou donâ€™t think about him ever
 ,â€ he growled. I heard his belt unbuckling and his pants unzipping. â€œIâ€™m the only man in your mind. In your mouth. In your tight little pussy. Do you understand?â€
â€œYes!â€ I was so delirious with lust I wouldâ€™ve said yes to anything at this point.
â€œTell me who you belong to.â€ He slid his cock against my drenched folds, and I almost had a mini-orgasm from that simple action alone.
â€œI belong to you.â€
Alex hissed out a breath, and that was the only warning I received before he slammed into me. He clapped a hand over my mouth, muffling my screams, but I was so far gone I barely noticed. I could only focus on the sensation of his cock pounding into me and the pleasure crashing over me in waves.
The framed photos from the exhibition banged against the wall with each thrust, and I dimly heard something crashing to the ground. I was about to come when Alex spun me around again so we faced each other. His skin was flushed with exertion, his eyes dark with lust.
He was the most beautiful thing Iâ€™d ever seen.
He crushed his lips to mine, hard and demanding. I yielded with no resistance, letting him into every part of meâ€”my heart, my soul, my life.
And you know what?
Alex and I, we fit perfectly.










Epilogue






AVA

â€œI kicked your ass.â€
â€œYou did not
 kick my ass,â€ Ralph grumbled. â€œYou got lucky with that last punch.â€
â€œItâ€™s all right.â€ Alex adjusted his shirt sleeves, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of triumph and amusement. â€œEvery student eventually becomes the teacher.â€
â€œBoy, Iâ€™ll knock you upside the head if you donâ€™t stop talking nonsense.â€ Despite his gruff words, Ralph was smiling.
â€œWhat did I say about arguing at the table?â€ Ralphâ€™s wife, Missy, raised her eyebrows. â€œStop quibbling so we can all enjoy dinner.â€
I hid a smile when Alex and Ralph muttered under their breaths but complied.
â€œWhat was that?â€ Her brows rose higher.
â€œNothing,â€ they chorused.
â€œTeach me your ways,â€ I whispered to Missy while the guys busied themselves with the roast chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. â€œHow do you do it?â€
She laughed. â€œWhen youâ€™ve been married for thirty-plus years, you learn a few things. Besidesâ€¦â€ Her eyes twinkled with mischief. â€œJudging by the way Alex looks at you, I donâ€™t think you have to worry about keeping him in line.â€
Alex looked up at the same moment I glanced at him. He winked, his mouth curving into a devilish smirk that had my toes curling in my boots.
I knew what that smirk foreshadowed.
Heat rose on my cheeks, and I pretended to be fascinated with my plate while Alexâ€™s low chuckle rumbled across the table.
Missy didnâ€™t miss a second of it. â€œOh, to be young and in love.â€ She sighed. â€œRalph and I married when we were in our early twenties. Iâ€™ve enjoyed every minuteâ€”except when he leaves his dirty clothes everywhere and refuses to see the doctorâ€”but thereâ€™s nothing like the passion that comes with youth. Everythingâ€™s so fresh and new. And the stamina. Whew!â€ She fanned herself. â€œWe were like bunnies, let me tell you.â€
By now, my cheeks were the color of the cranberry sauce on the table.
I adored Missy. I met her a week ago, when Alex and I arrived at her and Ralphâ€™s Vermont farm for an extended Thanksgiving weekend, but I immediately took a shine to her. Warm, friendly, and down-to-earth, she baked a mean pumpkin pie and had a penchant for raunchy jokesâ€”and raunchy personal stories.
This morning, out of the blue, she asked whether Iâ€™d ever had a threesomeâ€”I hadnâ€™tâ€”and Iâ€™d nearly sprayed orange juice all over her cherrywood table.
â€œI didnâ€™t mean to embarrass you.â€ Missy patted my arm, but the spark of mischief remained in her eyes. â€œIâ€™m just so thrilled Alex is dating. Iâ€™ve known that boy for years, and Iâ€™ve never seen him look at someone the way he does you. Iâ€™ve always said he just needs the right woman to open him up. He was wound tighter than a Victorian corset.â€
I leaned toward her and said in a conspiratorial whisper, â€œHonestly, not much has changed.â€
â€œYou know I can hear everything youâ€™re saying,â€ Alex said dryly.
â€œGood. I was afraid l wasnâ€™t loud enough.â€
His eyes narrowed while Missy burst into laughter. Even Ralph chuckled as I flashed a cheeky smile.
â€œSunshine, you being loud has never been an issue,â€ Alex said in silky voice.
My mashed potatoes went down the wrong pipe, and I erupted into a fit of coughs. Missyâ€™s laughter morphed into outright cackling. Poor Ralph turned bright red, muttered something about the restroom, and fled.
Once I got my coughs under control, I glared at Alex, who remained unfazed. â€œIâ€™m talking about the volume of your voice during conversations, of course.â€ He raised his wineglass to his lips. â€œWhat did you think I meant?â€
â€œI have a feeling you wonâ€™t be hearing my voice
 during conversations for a while,â€ I huffed.
â€œWeâ€™ll see.â€ He sounded infuriatingly smug.
â€œIâ€™ll leave you two lovebirds alone while I fetch Ralph.â€ Missy chuckled. â€œPoor thing is a lion in the bedroom but a blushing kitten when it comes to talking about sex in publicâ€”directly or indirectly.â€
That was something I couldâ€™ve lived the rest of my life without knowing.
After she left, I glared at Alex. â€œSee what you did? You drove our hosts away during their own dinner.â€
â€œDid I?â€ He gave an elegant shrug. â€œMight as well take advantage of the situation. Come here, Sunshine.â€
â€œI donâ€™t think so.â€
â€œThat wasnâ€™t a request.â€
â€œIâ€™m not a dog.â€ I took a defiant sip of my water.
â€œIf youâ€™re not in my lap in the next five seconds,â€ Alex said in the same calm voice. â€œIâ€™ll bend you over the table, rip off your skirt, and fuck you so hard Ralph will have a heart attack from your screams.â€
The bastard was crazy enough to do it, too. And I must be equally crazy, because my panties dampened at his words, and all I could think about was doing the exact thing heâ€™d just threatened.
Alex watched, eyes heated, as I pushed my chair back, walked over to him, and climbed into his lap.
â€œGood girl,â€ he purred, wrapping an arm around my waist and pulling me toward him until my back pressed against his chest. His arousal nestled against my ass, and my mouth turned bone-dry. â€œThat wasnâ€™t so hard, was it?â€
â€œI hate you.â€ I wouldâ€™ve been more convincing had the words not come out so breathless.
â€œHate is just another word for love.â€ He slipped a hand beneath my sweater and cupped my breast while trailing a string of fiery kisses down my neck.
â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s right,â€ I said, caught between laughing and moaning. God, his hands and mouth were magic.
I shot a furtive glance at the doorway to the dining room. Missy and Ralph were nowhere in sightâ€¦yet. But the possibility of getting caught made the whole thing hotterâ€”I was so wet I was afraid Iâ€™d leave a noticeable spot on Alexâ€™s pants when I stood.
â€œNo? Ah, well.â€ Alex nipped my earlobe. â€œClose enough.â€ He cupped my chin with his other hand and turned my face so I looked back at him. â€œDid you enjoy this week?â€
â€œYeah. It was the best Thanksgiving Iâ€™ve had in a while,â€ I said softly.
I felt guilty because while all my Thanksgivings with Michael were tainted, Iâ€™d spent the holiday with Josh last year. Heâ€™d flown to London, and we had a blast stuffing ourselves with foodâ€”restaurant-bought because we didnâ€™t know how to cook a turkeyâ€”while binge-watching British dramas. But Iâ€™d been unsure about my feelings for Alex, and Josh had been pissed at his ex-best friend.
He still was.
When he found out Alex and I were back together, he lost his shit. He wouldnâ€™t talk to me for weeks, and even now, our conversations were strained. Josh stayed in D.C. for his residency, so we still lived in the same city, but he refused to see me if Alex was there. Heâ€™d ignored all of Alexâ€™s outreach and seen through my schemes to help them patch things up. Iâ€™d invited him to celebrate Thanksgiving with us, but as Iâ€™d expected, heâ€™d declined.
â€œI do wish Josh couldâ€™ve made it,â€ I admitted. I missed my brother.
â€œMe too. But heâ€™ll come around.â€ Despite his confident words, a small furrow creased Alexâ€™s brow. He didnâ€™t say it, but I knew he missed Josh too. Theyâ€™d been as close as brothers.
Unfortunately, Josh was stubborn as a bull. The more you pushed him, the more he dug his heels in. The only thing we could do was give him time and wait.
â€œHe will.â€ I sighed and looped my arms around Alexâ€™s neck. â€œOther than that, though, this week was perfect.â€
Weâ€™d been in Vermont for six days, and the whole getaway had been a Pinterest-worthy autumn dream. Artisan fairs, a turkey trot, the best hot apple cider Iâ€™ve ever tastedâ€¦even Alex enjoyed being here, though he refused to admit it. Iâ€™d overheard his conversation with Ralph when his old Krav Maga instructor called and invited him up here for Thanksgiving, and it took me forever to convince him to accept.
â€œGood.â€ Alex dropped both his hands to my waist and kissed me on the lips. â€œBe glad I rented us our own cabin instead of staying here with Ralph and Missy,â€ he whispered. â€œBecause youâ€™re going to pay for your sass earlier.â€
My heart skipped with excitement. Before I could respond, Missy and Ralphâ€™s voices drifted through the doorway, and I jumped up so fast I banged my knee on the underside of the table.
I lunged into my chair, my face beet-red, right as our hosts reentered the room.
â€œSorry we took so long,â€ Missy chirped. â€œHope weâ€™re not interrupting anything.â€
â€œNope,â€ I squeaked. â€œI was just enjoying your delicious chicken.â€ I munched on the now-cold meat. â€œYum.â€
Alex snorted out a laugh, which earned him another glare from me.
â€œMost of the food is cold, dear.â€ Missy clucked in disappointment. â€œDo you want me to heat â€˜em up or skip straight to dessert? I made pecan pie, pumpkin pie, apple pieâ€”â€
â€œDessert!â€ Ralph and I shouted at the same time.
â€œAlex?â€ Missy raised her eyebrows.
â€œOne slice of pecan pie is fine, thank you.â€
â€œNonsense. Youâ€™re getting a slice of all three,â€ she said firmly. â€œI made â€˜em for a reason, didnâ€™t I?â€
What Missy wanted, Missy got.
By the time we left her and Ralphâ€™s house, I was full to the point of bursting.
I leaned into Alex for support as we made our way back to our rental cabin, which was a fifteen-minute walk away.
â€œWe should come here for Thanksgiving every year,â€ I said. â€œIf weâ€™re invited, that is.â€
He cast an incredulous glance in my direction. â€œNo.â€
â€œYou had fun!â€
â€œI did not. I hate small towns.â€ Alex placed a hand on the small of my back and steered me around a small puddle I hadnâ€™t noticed.
I pouted. â€œThen why did you come this year?â€
â€œBecause youâ€™ve never been to Vermont, and you wouldnâ€™t shut up about it. Now youâ€™ve been, so we donâ€™t have to come back.â€
â€œDonâ€™t try to act all tough. I saw you buy that little porcelain puppy at the artisan fair when you thought I wasnâ€™t looking. And you drag me to that hot cider shop down the road every afternoon.â€
Crimson stained Alexâ€™s cheeks. â€œItâ€™s called making lemonade out of lemons,â€ he growled. â€œYou are asking for it tonight.â€
â€œMaybe I am.â€ I squealed and broke out into a run when Alex reached for me. He caught me in, oh, five-point-two seconds, but I wasnâ€™t trying that hard to escape, and I wasnâ€™t exactly Usain Bolt after all the carbs Iâ€™d ingested.
â€œYouâ€™ll be the death of me,â€ he said, swinging me around until I faced him. The moonlight cast his features in sharp relief, making the pale lines of his cheekbones slash like blades through the darkness. Beautiful. Perfect. Coldâ€”except for the warmth of his embrace and the teasing glint in his eyes.
I wrapped my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist. â€œSo weâ€™re coming back for Thanksgiving next year, right?â€
Alex sighed. â€œMaybe.â€
In other words, yes.
I beamed. â€œMaybe we could come up early and go apple pickâ€”â€
â€œDonâ€™t push your luck.â€
Fair enough. Weâ€™d go apple picking the year after next. Seven hundred-odd days should be enough time to convince him.
â€œAlex?â€
â€œYes, Sunshine?â€
â€œI love you.â€
His face softened. â€œI love you, too.â€ His lips brushed over mine before he whispered, â€œBut donâ€™t think thatâ€™ll save you from the spanking youâ€™re getting once weâ€™re back in the cabin.â€
A shiver of anticipation rippled through me.
I couldnâ€™t wait.

ALEX



Contrary to what Ava said, I hated Vermont. There were some not-terrible parts, like the food and the fresh air, but me enjoying
 the countryside? I didnâ€™t know what she was talking about.
At all.
I did, however, miss all the time Iâ€™d gotten to spend with Ava over Thanksgiving after I returned to work.
It was almost embarrassing how fast Archer Group took me back as CEO when I returned from London. I wasnâ€™t surprisedâ€”I was the best. The guy who replaced me was fine as a placeholder, but even he knew his tenure at Archer had reached the end of the road when I walked into my office four months ago.
That office had always been mine, no matter who occupied the chair.
The board had been all too happy to have me back, and Archerâ€™s stock jumped twenty-four percent when my reinstatement as CEO hit the papers.
I did have a better work-life balance now that Ava had moved into my Logan Circle penthouse, mainly because Iâ€™d much rather be eating her out on our bed than eating takeout at my desk. I left the office around six these days, much to the relief of my staff.
â€œSunshine?â€ I called out, kicking the front door closed behind me. I hung my coat on the rack and waited for a response.
Nothing.
Ava, who worked as a junior freelance photographer for World Geographic
 and a few other magazines,
 was usually home by this time. Worry flickered in my stomach before I heard the squeak of the faucet turning and the faint but unmistakable sound of the shower running.
My shoulders relaxed. I was still paranoid about her safety and had hired a permanent bodyguard to look after her, much to her dismay. Weâ€™d had an all-out, knockdown fight over it, followed by equally all-out, knockdown makeup sex, but weâ€™d eventually compromisedâ€”weâ€™d keep the bodyguard, but she would stay out of sight and not interfere unless Ava was in physical danger.
Iâ€™d taken other precautions to ensure my enemies would think twice about going after her as wellâ€¦including seeding detailed â€œrumorsâ€ about what happened to the last guy whoâ€™d dared touch her.
Rest in hell, Camo.
The rumors worked. Some people were scared so shitless they couldnâ€™t look me in the eye anymore.
Hauss Industries was also toast, thanks to Madelineâ€™s unwise decision to be in cahoots with my uncle. Iâ€™d had plenty of blackmail on Madelineâ€™s father. Embezzling, money laundering, deals with unsavory charactersâ€¦heâ€™d been a busy man. All Iâ€™d had to do was slip an anonymous tip and select pieces of information to Haussâ€™s competitor, and they took care of the dirty work for me.
Last I heard, Madelineâ€™s father was facing years in prison, and Madeline was working at a skeezy diner in Maryland after the government froze all of her familyâ€™s assets.
The only person I was worried about was Michael, who Ava said kept sending Josh letters asking to see him. Josh had so far refused.
In an effort not to stain my hands with more blood, Iâ€™d dropped my plan to send Michael to an early grave in prison, but I had people on the inside monitoring himâ€”and making his life more than a little uncomfortable. If he so much as uttered Avaâ€™s name, Iâ€™d know about itâ€”and make sure he never did it again.
Out of habit, I turned on the flat-screen TV in our room and half-listened to the evening news as I peeled off my work clothes. I should join Ava in the shower. What was the point of having a massive rainfall shower with
 a handy bench seat if we didnâ€™t fuck in it at least once a week?
My penthouse was huge but had had minimal furnishings until Ava spruced it up after she moved in. And by â€œspruced up,â€ I mean art and flowers and framed pictures of us and her friends everywhere. Both Jules and Stella stayed in D.C. after graduation, while Bridget split her time between Eldorra, D.C., and New York. Her friends were more accepting of our rekindled relationship than Josh, but that didnâ€™t mean I wanted their faces staring at me twenty-four seven in my own damn house. Iâ€™d only agreed to display the photos because Ava wouldnâ€™t stop giving me sad puppy-dog eyes until I relented.
â€œYou shouldâ€™ve said no,â€ I muttered at a picture of myself and Ava at a Nats baseball game over the summer. It hung next to a more formal gallery of her work from Londonâ€”the ones I bought in bulk at the WYP exhibition.
She had me doing all sorts of crazy things these days, like giving up coffee and sticking to a sleep schedule. She said it would help with my insomnia, and yeah, I slept more hours than I used to, but that had more to do with having Ava by my side than anything else. Besides, I still sneak the occasional cup of coffee at the office.
I was about to enter the bathroom when something the newscaster said caught my attention. I stopped short, sure Iâ€™d heard wrong, but the scrolling chyron across the bottom of the screen confirmed what Iâ€™d heard.
The sound of the running shower switched off, and the rumble of the stall door sliding open filtered into the bedroom.
â€œAva?â€
There was a brief pause and a faint rustle. â€œYouâ€™re home early!â€ Ava stepped out of the bathroom in a swirl of steam, hair and skin damp, with nothing but a towel wrapped around her slender frame. She beamed when she saw me, and my face softened.
â€œSlow day in the office.â€ I dropped a kiss on her mouth. My cock stirred with interest, and I was tempted to rip off her towel and take her right there against the wall, but there was something she needed to know before we started one of our all-nighters. â€œDid you hear from Bridget today?â€
â€œNo.â€ Avaâ€™s brow furrowed. â€œWhy?â€
â€œCheck out the news.â€ I angled my head toward the TV, where the newscaster spoke a mile a minute.
Ava paused, listening to the update before her jaw dropped.
I didnâ€™t blame her. Because what just happened? It hadnâ€™t happened in over 200 years of Eldorran history.
The newscasterâ€™s high-pitched voice filled the room, so excited it trembled.
â€œâ€¦Crown Prince Nikolai has abdicated the throne of Eldorra to marry Sabrina Philips, the American flight attendant he met last year during a diplomatic trip to New York. Eldorran law stipulates the countryâ€™s monarchs
 must marry someone of noble birth. His sister, Princess Bridget, is now first in line to the throne. When she becomes Queen, she will be Eldorraâ€™s first female monarch in more than a centuryâ€¦â€

Footage of an expressionless Bridget exiting the Plaza Hotel in New York, trailed by her grim-faced bodyguard and surrounded by shouting reporters, flashed onscreen.
â€œHoly shit,â€ Ava said.
Holy shit was right. From what I rememberedâ€”which was everythingâ€”Bridget had chafed at the restrictions that came with being a regular princess. Now that she was first in line for the crown? She must be flipping out.
On TV, Rhys steered Bridget into a waiting car and leveled the reporters with a glare so menacing they backed up en masse. Most people wouldâ€™ve missed it, but I caught the heat in Bridgetâ€™s eyes when she looked at Rhys and the way his hand brushed hers for a second longer than it shouldâ€™ve before he closed the door.
I filed that piece of information away for the future. Bridget was Avaâ€™s friend, so she was safe, but it never hurt to have blackmail material on a future queen.
Based on what I just witnessed, Bridgetâ€™s feelings about her impending rule were the least of her problems.


THE END






He canâ€™t have herâ€¦but heâ€™s taking her anyway.

Preorder Twisted Games
