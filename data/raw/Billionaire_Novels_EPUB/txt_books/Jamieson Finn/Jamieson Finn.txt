Chapter One

 
Jamieson
I sat
at the bar with a scotch in my hand and thought about the flight back to Los
Angeles tomorrow morning. I had a million and one things to do when I got back
including a craniotomy on a sixteen-year-old girl with a Glioblastoma. The bar
was pretty crowded for a Wednesday night. On one side of me sat a man who just
had a fight with his wife. Unfortunately, I had to hear all about it. On the
other side of me sat a woman who was just fired from her job. I had to hear all
about that too since she was so inebriated. I tried to tune both people out by
listening to the soft and subtle blues music that played throughout the place.
“Can I
get one more?” I asked the bartender as I held my glass up.
One
more drink and then I’d head to my hotel, get some much needed sleep, and head
home in the morning. Finally, the man sitting next to me got up and left, and
the woman on the other side of me laid her head down on the bar and pretty much
passed out. I sighed as I got up from the bar stool, helped her up and put her
into a cab. When I walked back in, I noticed a woman with long blonde hair
sitting in my seat.
“Excuse
me. I was sitting here,” I spoke.
“Oh.
I’m sorry. I saw you leaving with that woman,” she spoke as her baby blue eyes stared
into mine.
“I was
just helping her into a cab. She had one too many.”
The
blonde went to get up and I stopped her.
“It’s
fine. I’ll just sit here,” I spoke as I took the stool next to her.
“So,
you didn’t know that woman?” she asked.
“No.”
I reached over and grabbed my scotch.
“That
was very saintly of you to help her.” She grinned.
“Trust
me, I’m far from being a saint.” I threw back my drink. “What are you
drinking?”
“Gin
and Tonic,” she spoke.
“May I
buy you another one?”
“Sure.”
She smiled. “If you’re buying me a drink, I should introduce myself. “I’m
Grace.” She held out her slender hand.
“Nice
to meet you Grace. I’m Jamieson.” I lightly shook her hand. “Bartender, another
Gin and Tonic for Grace here.”
“Coming
right up.”
“I’m
curious as to why a beautiful woman like you is sitting in a bar all by
herself.” I smirked.
“It’s
my last hoorah. Tomorrow, I’m starting a new life.”
“New
life? Interesting. What’s wrong with your old life?”
“A
lot.” She picked up her drink and took a sip. “How about you? Why is a handsome
man like yourself sitting in a bar all alone?”
“This
is my last night in New York. I’m here on business.”
She
was beautiful, and my cock was starting to rise to the occasion. I’d had a bit
of a dry spell lately and hadn’t had sex in about six weeks. Six weeks too long
as far as I was concerned.
“If
you’ll excuse me. I need to use the ladies room. Will you save my seat?” she
asked.
“Of
course.”
I
watched her walk across the bar and over to the hallway where the restrooms
were located. Short black dress, black heels, hourglass figure, and long lean
legs. My imagination ran wild with images of what was underneath that sexy
dress. With any luck, I’d find out soon enough. A few moments later she
returned and took her seat next to me with a smile.
“Thanks
for saving my seat.”
“I
told you I would. You’re much better company than the last two people that were
here.” I smirked.
“Thank
you.” She held up her glass to me. “Here’s to your last night in New York.”
“And here’s
to the last night of your old life.” I tipped my glass to hers. 
I
studied her. Her look, her body movement and I hesitated for a moment.
“Want
to get out of here?” I asked.
“And
go where?” The corners of her mouth curved upwards.
“My
hotel is right around the corner.”
“Are
you married?” she asked.
“No.”
“Do
you have a girlfriend?”
“Nope.”
I shook my head.
“Then
sure. Lead the way.”
I
threw some cash on the bar and we headed to my hotel.
****
Grace
Why
the hell not? He was incredibly sexy with his short brown hair, strong
masculine jawline that sported the sexiest five o’clock shadow and eyes that
were gray with a hint of blue swirled within. Not to mention his six-foot three
muscular body. This was my last night in New York before I ventured off tomorrow
to a new city and leave my old life behind. Might as well have one last New
York fling.
We
walked around the block to the Mandarin Hotel.
“Impressive,”
I spoke as we walked through the lobby to the elevators.
“Wait
until you see the room.” He winked.
The
moment the elevator doors shut, Jamieson placed his hand on my cheek and
brought his lips to mine.
“I’ve
been wanting to do that for a while,” he spoke.
“I’ve
been wanting you to.” I grinned.
The
elevator stopped on the thirty-eighth floor. We stepped out into the prestigious
hallway where Jamieson held my hand and led me to his suite.
“What
exactly do you do for a living?” I smirked as we entered the room.
“Does
it matter? It’s not like we’ll ever see each other again after tonight. I’m
flying home, you’re starting a new life, so let’s just leave it at that,” he
spoke as he placed his hands on each side of my face.
“Fine
with me.”
Our
lips collided, and our tongues met for the first time. I was overly turned on
by this man and my already soaked panties proved it. He reached around and
unzipped my dress, letting it fall to the ground, exposing my bare breasts. My
nipples hardened at his stare as his fingers lightly brushed against them. His
hand wrapped around my back and held me in place while his other hand dipped down
the front of my panties, navigating its way to my wet and sensitive area.
“I
love the fact that you’re so wet,” he whispered as his tongue stroked my neck.
“You
turn me on. What can I say? My body is naturally reacting.”
“I
know something else that will turn you on even more.”
He
dipped his finger inside me and I gasped. The pleasure this man gave was
intoxicating and erased the pain I’d felt over the past month. My nails dug
into the cotton of his shirt as he explored me, hitting my G-spot and sending me
over the edge to a full blown orgasm. Arching my back with the tight grip he
had around me, I threw my head back and felt like I’d died and gone to Heaven.
Shit. I’d never felt anything like it before. What the hell just happened?
“Damn,
that was amazing.” He smiled.
My
heart was pounding out of my chest as he lightly pushed me back on the bed. Taking
a step back, he quickly unbuttoned his shirt and threw it to the floor. I felt
the vibrations down below as I stared at his muscular arms, chest and beautifully
sculpted six pack. I waited in anticipation as he took down his pants that
revealed his black boxer briefs.
“Come
here,” I spoke.
He
walked towards me as I sat on the edge of the bed. Hooking my fingers around
the waistband of his briefs, I slowly took them down, releasing his large hard
cock. I gulped at the madness in front of me.
Thank you, I silently whispered.
Wrapping
my fingers around his shaft, I moved it up and down. Moans of pleasure erupted
from him as he tangled his fingers in my hair. I took him inside my mouth and
sucked him as if he was a lollipop. His grip on my hair tightened as he pushed
my head down so I could take almost all of him in.
“Fuck,”
he moaned. “Oh God.”
He
lifted my head and removed himself from me.
“I
don’t want to come yet.” He panted as he pushed me on my back.
He
bent down and his tongue made its way up my inner
thigh and he removed my panties with ease. The wetness poured from me as
excitement raged throughout my body. Not only did this man have magical hands,
but he had a magical tongue that sent my body into another orgasm.
He
stood up, grabbed his pants from the floor and took a condom out of his wallet.
Tearing the package open with his mouth, he rolled the condom over his hard
cock. This was it. He was going in and I was more than ready. Hovering over me,
his lips met mine and he thrust inside me, quickly but with ease.
****
Jamieson
The
heat inside her was overwhelming as my cock was buried between her fiery walls.
The pleasure, the power, and the freedom I felt was indescribable. There was
something different about her than the other women I’d fucked, and I couldn’t
explain it. This total stranger. This beautiful stranger held me captive in her
hold as I thrust in and out of her. Her sexual moans graced the room and turned
me on even more which I thought was impossible. Her body was perfect, just like
I imagined back at the bar. I gave a few more thrusts and then pulled out and
flipped her on her stomach. Entering her from behind, I sat up and grabbed hold
of her tight ass while my cock took its pleasure. Between both of our moans, I
was sure the people next to me could hear, but I didn’t care. This was the best
sex I’d had in a very long time and I didn’t want it to end.
I
pulled out and flipped her on her back, taking her perfect C cup natural
breasts in my mouth while I thrust in and out of her again with long smooth
strokes. I sat her up and wrapped my arms around her as her legs wrapped
tightly around my waist. We both moved simultaneously, slow and with ease. She
wanted to make this last as much as I did.
“Come
with me,” I whispered as I pulled out of her.
“Where?”
I gave
her a smile as I grabbed her hand, helped her from the bed and led her over to
the large window that overlooked the brightly lit city.
“Jamieson.”
“Don’t
worry. Nobody can see us up here.”
I
pushed her up against the glass as I held her hands with mine against it. My
body pressed into hers as my cock found its way inside her. I stared at the
reflection of us through the window while I fucked her. My fingers interlaced
with hers as I felt her tighten around me and the rush of warmth coated me. I
moved in and out of her like an animal as the pressure increased and my cock
exploded, leaving me breathless with an out of control heart rate. I dropped my
head to her shoulder as I tried to regain my breath. She unhooked one of our
hands and brought it around to the back of my neck, softly stroking it with her
delicate fingers.
I
pulled out and went straight to the bathroom to dispose of the condom.
“Are
you sure nobody saw us?” she asked as she put on her panties.
“And
so what if they did?” I smirked.
She
picked up her dress and slipped it on, asking me to zip it up for her.
“You
don’t have to leave,” I spoke.
“Actually,
I do. It’s eleven forty-five. In fifteen minutes, it’ll be tomorrow and the start
of my new life. I can’t very well start it in a hotel room with a stranger.”
“I
guess not,” I spoke with disappointment as I hoped we could have sex again one
more time before I left. “Good luck with your new life.”
“Thank
you.” She smiled as she kissed my cheek. “Have a safe flight home.” She placed
her hand on my bare chest.
“Thanks.”
She
grabbed her purse from the table and headed towards the door.
“Hey,
for what it’s worth, I kind of get that whole saint vibe from you.”
I
chuckled as she opened the door and walked out.







Chapter Two

Grace
I left
his hotel room, stepped into the elevator, and let out a deep breath as the
doors closed. What the hell just happened? Craziness, that’s what. Sexy, hot
craziness all rolled into one. I could still feel the vibrations down below.
Literally, my old life went out with a bang! I shook my head to move back into
reality as I hailed a cab to my apartment. Opening the door, I flipped on the
lights and stared at the empty space before me except two suitcases, a carry-on
bag, a pillow, and a blanket. Grabbing the blanket, I took a seat on the floor
and brought my knees to my chest. Thoughts about the memories here filled my
head and broke my heart. I took in a deep breath as I fought back the tears and
swallowed the lump in my throat. Betrayal took place here. The ultimate
betrayal. Getting out of this city was the only option I had. I needed to start
new and rebuild my life one day at a time.
I
landed in Los Angeles and took an Uber to the car dealership to pick up my new
car that I purchased. I did everything online and had the salesman, Howard, Facetime
me and show me the vehicle.
“It’s
nice to finally meet you, Miss Harper.” He smiled as he shook my hand.
“Please,
call me Grace.”
“So,
big change from New York to Los Angeles. Two totally different worlds as far as
I’m concerned.”
“I’ve
lived here before,” I spoke. “Many years ago.”
“Oh.
Well then, welcome home.” A grin crossed his face.
I gave
him a small smile and signed the paperwork that sat in front of me.
“Excellent.
Follow me and I’ll take you to your car.”
I got
up from my seat and followed him out to the lot where I saw my white 2018
Volkswagen Beetle convertible.
“Here
she is.” He opened the door.
I
climbed inside with a smile on my face. This was the kind of car I’d always
wanted.
“It’s
perfect.” I gripped the steering wheel. “My two suitcases should fit, right?” I
asked with concern.
“I’m
sure they will. Let’s find out.”
Howard
picked up my suitcases and stacked them in the backseat.
“Just
keep the top up until you unload them,” he spoke as he handed me my carry-on.
Taking
it from him, I put it in the front seat next to me and thanked him.
“Thank
you for your patience with me, Howard.” I smiled.
“You
were a pleasure to work with, Grace. Good luck here in Los Angeles.”
“Thanks,”
I spoke as I waved goodbye and pulled out of the lot.
I
pulled into the parking garage of my new apartment building, found my
designated spot, and went to the leasing office.
“Can I
help you?” A tall redhead smiled.
“Hi.
I’m Grace Harper and I’m moving into apartment 3C.”
“Ah
yes. Welcome. I have your keys right here.” She dangled them in front of me.
“Did
my furniture arrive?” I asked.
“Yes.
The truck was here this morning. Everything is in your apartment.”
“Thank
you.” I smiled.
“You’re
welcome. If you need anything or have any questions or concerns, just give me a
call.”
I went
back to my car, grabbed my suitcases and my carry-on, and took the elevator up
to the third floor. Inserting the key into the lock, I pushed open the door and
took in a long, deep breath as I stepped inside. Boxes were everywhere, and I
couldn’t wait to start unpacking and put everything in its place. I needed to
do this today because I started my new job tomorrow, and once that started, I’d
have zero time. As I was unpacking all my kitchen gear, my phone rang, and it
was my Aunt Cora calling.
“Hello,”
I answered.
“Hello,
it’s your favorite aunt, darling.”
“You’re
my only aunt.” I laughed.
“Just
checking in to make sure you made it to Los Angeles safely.”
“I
did. I’m just unpacking.”
“Are
you okay?” she asked with concern.
“Yes.
Of course I am.”
“I’m
not talking about him, Grace. I’m talking about being in Los Angeles.”
“I
know, Aunt Cora. It’s all good. It’s been twenty years.”
“Okay.
I expect to hear from you every other day,” she spoke. “If you need anything, I
can be there in a flash at any time.”
“Thanks,
Aunt Cora. I’ll do my best to call you every other day, but you know, with my
work schedule.”
“I
know, Grace. I love you.”
“I
love you too. Talk to you soon.”
I ended
the call, finished unpacking, and headed to Trader Joe’s around the corner to
buy some food.
****
My
alarm went off, and after shutting it down, I sighed as I rolled over and
hugged my pillow for a few moments before climbing out of bed and getting in
the shower. Today was the first day of my new job, and I’d admit I was pretty
nervous. Not about the job, but where it was. I took in a deep breath as I
grabbed my coffee and my purse and headed out the door. As soon as the elevator
door to the parking garage opened, I heard people screaming. I knew those
screams, so I ran out of the parking garage and across the street where a group
of people were gathered around a young woman lying on the cement.
“I’m a
doctor. What happened?” I shouted as I knelt down.
“She
was shot,” a bystander spoke. “I called 911. They’re on their way.”
“What’s
your name?” I asked the victim as I lifted her shirt and examined her gunshot
wound.
“Carla,”
she barely spoke.
“You’re
going to be okay. Stay with me, Carla. 
How old are you?”
“Thirty-five.”
She struggled to say the words.
“Do
you know who did this to you?”
“My
husband,” she whispered.
“You,
come here.” I pointed to the bystander who called 911. I need you to put
pressure on the wound. Push down as hard as you can. We have to control the
bleeding.”
He
knelt down beside me and did as I asked while I grabbed my stethoscope from my
purse and listened to her heart and lungs. I heard the ambulance coming and
took over applying pressure on her abdomen.
“Please
don’t let me die,” Carla cried.
“You’re
not going to die. Not today and not on my watch.” I smiled.
“What
do we have?” one of the paramedics asked.
“Gunshot
wound to the abdomen. Her pulse is weak, and she’s lost a lot of blood. We need
to get her to the ER now.”
The
paramedics loaded Carla into the ambulance, hooked her up to an IV, and gave
her oxygen while I continued to apply pressure to control the bleeding.







Chapter Three

Grace
“Thirty-five-year-old
female with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. I need an abdominal CT, blood
count, creatine, electrolytes, calcium level, lactic acid, and blood gases.
Call the OR and let them know we’ll be coming up.”
“I’m
sorry, but who are you?” a woman with short black hair in burgundy scrubs asked
from the doorway.
“I’m
your new trauma attending. Any other questions you’d like to ask before this patient
bleeds to death?” I cocked my head.
“Umm.
No. I’ll call the OR.”
“No
surgery.” Carla grabbed hold of my arm.
“You
don’t have a choice. I need to stop the bleed in your belly or you’ll die.”
“My
head,” she slurred and began to seize.
“She’s
seizing. Push ten milligrams of Diazepam. I need a portable head CT now, and
page neuro, stat.”
I got
the head CT and looked at the computer image as soon as it loaded on the screen.
“Where’s neuro?” I shouted.
“What
do we—” He stopped when he walked into the room and looked at me with a shocked
expression on his face.
I
stood there for a second, unable to speak as our eyes locked onto each other’s.
There was no time for a reaction to the man that was staring back at me.
“Gunshot
wound to the abdomen and an intercranial bleed.” I pointed to the CT scan. 
“Let’s
get her up to the OR. I’ll let you know how she does,” he spoke.
“Excuse
me? I need to remove the bullet from her abdomen, stop the bleeding, and repair
any residual damage. She’s already lost a lot of blood.”
“You’re
a surgeon?” he asked with a shocked tone.
“Trauma
surgeon. You’re neuro?” I raised my brow at him.
“Yeah.”
He smiled. “Let’s go. You take the abdomen and I’ll take the head.”
The patient
was the number one priority and I didn’t have time to process the fact that
Jamieson, the man I slept with my last night in New York City, was a
neurosurgeon at the hospital I was now working at and going to be operating
with. Oh my God, this wasn’t happening.
As we
were scrubbing in, he wouldn’t stop staring at me.
“Aren’t
you going to say anything?” he asked.
“What’s
there to say? I think I’m just as shocked as you are.”
“You
bet I am. You failed to mention that you were moving to L.A. and that you were
a doctor that night,” he spoke.
“Me? I
asked you what you did and you said it wasn’t important, remember?” I arched my
brow. “Plus, why would I tell you I was moving to L.A.? We barely talked, if
you remember.”
“We can
discuss this later after we save this woman’s life,” he spoke.
I went
into the operating room and he followed behind, cracking open Carla’s skull
while I made an incision into her abdomen.
“I
need to repair the small bowel and there’s a tear in her liver. I need an x-ray
over here to try and locate the bullet.”
“Are
you sure there’s no exit wound?” Jamieson asked as he operated on her brain.
“I’m
one hundred percent sure,” I spoke as I narrowed my eye at him.
“First
day?” he asked.
“Yes,
and first patient. I was in the parking garage of my apartment building when I
heard screaming from across the street.”
“And
where is your apartment?”
“West
Hollywood.”
“That
explains it,” he spoke.
I
sighed as I finished repairing the small bowel and moved on to the liver.
“Vessels
repaired, and the bleeding has stopped,” he spoke.
I was
working on repairing her liver, and as soon as Jamieson closed up Carla’s head,
he stood next to me.
“Nice
work.”
“Thanks.”
“Are
you seeing what I’m seeing?” he asked as he stared at the x-ray.
“If
you’re talking about the bullet against the renal artery, yes, I see it.”
“That’s
really risky to remove. You could do some serious damage to this poor woman.”
“I
know that. What would you do in my situation?” I asked as I glanced over at
him.
He
stared at me for a moment.
“I’d
remove it.”
“Good.
Glad to hear we’re on the same page.” I smirked.
“Do
you need some help?” he asked.
“No.
I’ve got this. Don’t you think I do?” I asked.
“I
didn’t say that. Looks to me like you’re very good at your job. I was just
offering my assistance.”
“I
appreciate it, Dr.—” I glanced over at him.
“Finn,”
he replied.
“Like
I said, Dr. Finn, I appreciate it, but I’ve got this.”
“Okay.
But if you don’t mind, I’d like to stand here and watch.”
“Suit
yourself.”
I
carefully, and with extremely steady hands, snared out the bullet, being extra
careful not to tear the renal artery. I dropped the bullet into the steel bowl
and let out a deep breath.
“Bullet
is out. She’s going to be okay,” I spoke as I began to close her up. “Thank you
everyone for helping and assisting me and Dr. Finn today. You all did a great
job.”
Jamieson
and I walked out of the operating room and scrubbed out.
“I
never did get your last name, Doctor,” he spoke.
“It’s
Harper. Dr. Grace Harper.” I smiled as I walked away.
I took
in a deep breath as I stepped into the elevator and took it up to the fifth
floor. Placing my hand on my belly, I tried to calm the fluttering inside.
Shit. This was not good. Not good at all. As soon as the elevator doors opened,
I walked down the hallway and stepped inside the office of Renata Sinclair,
Chief of Staff and Medical Director.
“Dr.
Harper, how’s your patient?” she asked. “I walked down to the ER and Jackie
told me you were already in the operating room.”
“She’s
going to be fine. It’s good to see you again, Renata.” I smiled as we hugged.
“Welcome
to Cedars-Sinai, Grace. What a way to start your first day. I heard you operated
with our Chief Neurosurgeon, Dr. Finn.”
“I
did.”
“And?”
she smirked.
“And
what?”
“No
swooning, tripping over your feet when he’s around, heart palpitations, mild
sweating?”
“He
seems nice.” I grinned.
“He’s
arrogant, cocky, and a womanizer, but he’s the best neurosurgeon in the country
and a great asset to this hospital. Don’t let him get to you and don’t take
anything personally. As long as you remember those two things, you’ll do just
fine.”
“I can
handle men like Dr. Finn.” I smirked.
“I
know you can, and I was beyond thrilled when I got your call. I never thought
you’d leave New York.”
“It
was time for a change.”
“I
thought you were happy at the hospital?”
“I
was. It’s more of a personal change,” I spoke.
“Well,
I’m glad you’re here.” She smiled. “You are another great asset to this
hospital, my dear.”







Chapter Four

Jamieson
I
inhaled a sharp breath as I watched her walk away. This was unbelievable. I
never thought in a million years I’d ever see her again, let alone work with
her. Damn it. She was the new trauma attending, and now I’d see her practically
every day. The one thing I couldn’t stop thinking about was how she told me she
was starting a new life the night I met her. Little did I know her new life
included living in Los Angeles and working at my hospital. This posed a problem
for me.
I went
up to Renata’s office and lightly knocked on the door before entering.
“Oh,
excuse me. I didn’t know you were with someone,” I spoke as I stared at Grace.
“Dr.
Finn.” Renata smiled. “You’ve met Dr. Grace Harper?”
“Yes.
We just saved a woman’s life together.”
“I
heard. Good job. Come in and sit down. I’m just finishing up with Dr. Harper.”
I
swallowed hard as I took a seat in one of the chairs across from her desk.
Grace walked out of the office and Renata took a seat behind her desk and
folded her hands.
“I saw
the way you looked at her, Jamieson. Leave her alone. Understand?”
“What?”
I held my arms out. “I haven’t done anything.”
“Not
yet you haven’t. It’s already going to be hard on her as it is being here.”
“Why
is that?” I narrowed my eye.
“That’s
none of your business.” She pointed at me. “Now, the reason I needed to speak
with you is because Mary called this morning and said she quit. She couldn’t
even bother giving two weeks’ notice. Do you know anything about that?” Her
brow arched.
I
cleared my throat and shifted in my seat. “No. I have no idea.”
“I’m
sure you don’t,” she spoke in a sarcastic tone.
“Are
we done here, Renata? I have a consult with a patient I’m late for.”
“We’re
done, Dr. Finn.” She pursed her lips. “Remember what I said about Dr. Harper.
And another thing, if I lose any more staff, best neurosurgeon or not, I’m
coming after you.”
I put
my hand up. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be on my best behavior.” I smirked.
“I
won’t worry because I’ll be keeping a close eye on you.”
I
sighed as I rolled my eyes and walked out of her office. Why the hell would it
be hard for Grace to be here? Why would she come to Los Angeles in the first
place if that was the case? I got the impression Renata knew her. Grace Harper
was a mysterious woman the night I met her, and now she became even more
mysterious. As much as I didn’t want to care or get involved, I was curious, and
I was going to find out what her story was.
“Hello,
Mr. Bind. I’m Dr. Finn.” I extended my hand.
“Nice
to meet you Dr. Finn. This is my wife, Athena.”
“Nice
to meet you.” I smiled as I lightly shook her hand and then took a seat behind my
desk and opened his file.
“It
says here you’ve been having some trouble walking and you’ve been experiencing back
pain.”
“Yes.
I’ve been to two doctors already and they can’t seem to find out what the problem
is other than a strained muscle in my back. But nothing is helping, and the
pain is getting worse.”
“Any
other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?” I asked.
“Tell
him, Jeff,” his wife spoke.
“Athena.”
His brows furrowed at her.
I
arched by brow at him. “What’s been going on?”
“I’ve
been losing control of my bladder lately,” he spoke with embarrassment.
“Okay.
Anything else I need to know?”
“He’s
been complaining that his right leg keeps going numb and the other day he fell
twice,” his wife Athena spoke.
“I
see. Well, I can promise you that I will get to the bottom of all these
symptoms you’re having. I’m going to schedule you for an MRI, and I want it
done today. If you’ll wait here a moment, I’ll go speak with the scheduling
nurse and see when we can fit you in.”
“Thank
you, Dr. Finn,” Jeff Bind spoke.
“You’re
welcome.” I smiled as I got up from my desk, walked out of my office, and down
the hall to see Yvonne.
“Dr.
Finn, let me guess. You need an MRI scheduled for today,” she spoke with a
raised brow as I walked into her office.
“How
do you always know that, Yvonne?” I smirked.
“Because
it’s the only time you ever walk down here.”
“I
have a patient who needs one stat. What’s open?”
“We’re
completely booked, Dr. Finn.”
“Yvonne.”
I smiled. “Work with me.”
“Three
o’clock.” She pursed her lips as she looked at me.
I
glanced at my watch and saw it was one.
“Perfect.
The name is Jeffery Bind. I’ll go tell him. Thanks, Yvonne.” I winked. I walked
into my office and took a seat behind my desk. “Your MRI is scheduled for three
o’clock, so I would suggest going to the cafeteria and grabbing some lunch and
we’ll see you back here at two thirty. Are you claustrophobic at all?” I asked.
“No.
I’m not.”
“Good.
I’ll see you in the MRI room.” I smiled as I stood up and shook his hand.
“Excuse me, I’m needed down in the ER,” I spoke as I looked at my pager.
 “Someone paged me?” I asked Jackie, the ER
charge nurse.
“Dr.
Harper did. She’s in room five.”
“You
paged me?” I asked as I walked into the room and saw a child approximately two
years old lying in the bed.
“Yes.
I need to speak with you for a moment.” She gestured toward the hall.
“What’s
going on that you needed me down here?” I asked.
“Two-year-old
male named Charlie. His parents brought him for flu symptoms. They took him to
their family doctor last week and he’s not getting any better. He sleeps all
day, vomiting on and off, and he’s been complaining his head hurts.”
“Sounds
like the flu to me,” I spoke.
“That’s
what I thought too until I was talking to him and noticed his asymmetric eye
movements and his parents said that when he goes to get up, he falls every
time.”
“You
think it’s a brain tumor?” I asked.
“AT/RT,”
she spoke.
“Come
on, Grace. I would say that’s jumping the gun.”
“I
hope I’m wrong, but I don’t think I am. I’ve seen it before.”
I
narrowed my eye at her for a moment and then slowly shook my head.
“Fine.
I’ll schedule an MRI. Sedate him first and then bring him upstairs,” I spoke.
“And I pray to God you’re wrong.”
“Me
too,” she softly spoke as she walked back into the room.







Chapter Five

Grace
I took
a break and went up to the rooftop where a coffee station was set up and
several small tables and chairs took up the space. Grabbing a coffee that I
desperately needed, I stood against the railing and looked out into the city of
Los Angeles. I couldn’t believe I was back here, not only in this city, but in
this hospital. The one place that held the most traumatic memories for me, and
the one place that decided my fate.
How
fucked up was it that I was now dealing with the man I had sex with back in New
York as I left my old life behind? A complete stranger I was never supposed to
see again. Was this the universe playing a dirty trick on me? Was I being
punished for something? He was so damn sexy, and every time I saw him, I
couldn’t stop thinking about that night.
“I see
you found the rooftop,” I heard Jamieson’s voice from behind.
I
slowly turned around and watched as he poured his coffee.
“Jackie
told me about it.”
“Best
place of the entire hospital. Especially at night when the city is lit up,” he
spoke as he walked over and stood next to me by the railing. “I think we should
talk, Grace.”
“About
what?” I glanced over at him.
“That
night in New York City.”
“What
about it?”
“The
fact that we had sex and now we’re working together. I just don’t want you to
get the wrong idea.”
“Ah, you
don’t want me to think that because we had sex there could be something between
us.”
“Something
like that.” He took a sip of his coffee.
“Is
that usually what happens when you sleep with a woman?”
“Unfortunately.”
A smirk crossed his face.
“I’m
not like the other women you’ve slept with. So no worries, Dr. Finn. Trust me
when I say there is absolutely nothing between us. I didn’t think about it
then, I don’t think it now, and I never will. It was one night of two
consenting adults and it meant absolutely nothing. A relationship or even the
thought of one is not a part of my new life.”
“Good.
Mine either. I’m happy we cleared that up,” he spoke.
Both
our pagers went off, and after I glanced at mine, I looked at Jamieson.
“Charlie’s
MRI is done,” I spoke.
“Let’s
go take a look.” He sighed as he threw his coffee cup into the garbage can.
We
walked down to the MRI control room where the technician had Charlie’s scans on
the computer screen.
“Shit,”
Jamieson spoke. “There’s a tumor in the posterior fossa region.” He pointed.
“You were right.” He glanced over at me as he heavily sighed and rubbed the
back of his neck. “It’s times like these I hate my job,” he spoke. “By the way,
how did you get stuck with this patient? I thought you were trauma?”
“The
ER is short staffed, and I’m needed all over the place,” I spoke.
“Welcome
to Cedars-Sinai, Dr. Harper. Shall we go tell Charlie’s parents together?”
“Sure.”
I sighed.
We
walked back down to the ER where Charlie’s parents were in the room at his
bedside. I took in a deep breath as I prepared myself. Other than losing a
patient, this was the hardest part of my job and it never got easier.
“Mr. and
Mrs. Canfield, we have the results back of Charlie’s MRI, and I’m afraid it’s
not good news,” I spoke. “Charlie has a brain tumor known as AT/RT in the
posterior fossa region of his brain,” I spoke.
“Near
his stem cell,” Jamieson chimed in.
“Oh my
God.” Mrs. Canfield began to shake as her eyes filled with tears.
“Are
you saying that our son has brain cancer?” Mr. Canfield asked with nervousness.
“Yes.
I’m afraid so,” Jamieson spoke. “It is imperative that we operate immediately
to remove as much of the tumor as possible. After the surgery, we’ll send in a pediatric
oncologist to discuss chemotherapy and or radiation for Charlie.”
I
swallowed hard as Mrs. Canfield broke down and Mr. Canfield tried his best to
hold it together.
“I’m
so sorry,” I spoke to them as my eyes filled with tears.
“Are
you a pediatric neurosurgeon?” Mr. Canfield asked Jamieson.
“No,
I’m not. But I’m the best neurosurgeon in the country, I’ve operated on many
children, and I can assure you that Charlie is in good hands with me. I’ll need
your permission to perform the surgery.”
“Of
course.” Mr. Canfield slowly nodded his head as he wiped the tears from his
eyes.
“Get
him prepped and I’ll send the anesthesiologist down,” Jamieson spoke as he
lightly patted my arm.
****
I was
in the ER doctor’s lounge talking with Jackie when Jamieson walked in.
“How
did it go?” I asked.
“He’s
stable. I was able to remove eighty-five percent of the tumor. The rest is in
the pediatric oncologist’s hands now. Jackie, can I have a moment with Dr.
Harper, please?”
“Sure.”
She raised her brow at him as she walked out of the lounge.
“What
are doing after your shift?” he asked.
“Going
home. Why?”
“I was
thinking maybe we could grab some dinner together. I am the only person you
know in Los Angeles, so I thought that a proper welcome was in order.”
“Is
that so?” I narrowed my eye at him. “To be honest, I don’t know you at all.”
“We
had sex, Grace. I think we know each other, at least a little bit.” He smirked.
“I’m not a total stranger.”
“I get
off at eight.” I smiled.
“Great.
I’ll pick you up down here.”
“Okay.”
I nodded as I gave him a light smile.
He walked
out of the lounge and I let out a deep breath. He was right, he was the only
person I knew in Los Angeles, besides Renata. As much as I hated to admit it,
dinner with him sounded kind of nice. We could be friends. No big deal. Ironic,
wasn’t it? He was my last fling in New York before I said goodbye to my old
life, and my new friend in Los Angeles where I started my new one. I walked out
to the nurses’ station, where Jackie sat behind her computer giving me the evil
eye.
“What?”
I smiled.
“What’s
up with you and Dr. Finn?”
“Nothing.
We’re just grabbing a bite to eat after work.”
“I
like you, Grace. I’ve only known you a few short hours, but I can tell we’re
going to be good friends, and as a friend, I feel it’s my duty to warn you
about him.”
“Trust
me, Jackie, you don’t have to.”
“Oh,
but I do. He is the finest-looking specimen to ever walk the face of this earth
and he knows it. He uses it to his advantage with women. He’s nothing but a
heartbreaker, commitment-phobe, and a manwhore. I just don’t want to see you
get caught up in his games.”
I
liked Jackie and I liked how blunt she was. She was a woman in her late
thirties who stood about five-foot-five with long brown wavy hair, brown eyes,
and olive skin. She was a tough cookie. That much I could tell.
“Trust
me. I won’t get caught up in anything. I know guys like Dr. Finn and I’m well
aware of their massive insecurities.” I smiled. “Besides, relationships of any
kind are off the table for me. I came here to Los Angeles to start a new life
and Dr. Jamieson Finn does not fit into that plan.”
“You
go, girl.” She grinned as she high-fived me. “You just may be the only woman in
existence to say no to him.”
God, if she only knew.







Chapter Six

Jamieson
Did I
do the right thing by asking her to dinner? Of course I did. She didn’t know
anyone here and I’d already had sex with her and I wanted it again. If she was
that easy to get to my hotel room back in New York, she’d be even easier now,
and that made my cock twitch. When she told me she wasn’t interested in
relationships, I believed her. It was the way she said it. The firmness in her
tone. She actually seemed a little cold, except when it came to her patients.
She said that getting into a relationship wasn’t a part of her new life. It
made me wonder what and who she was running from. With any luck, I’d find out
tonight.
“Mr.
Bind,” I spoke as I walked into my office. “I apologize for the delay and I
thank you for your patience, but I had to operate on a two-year-old from the
ER.”
“Gee,
Dr. Finn. I hope the kid is okay.”
I gave
him a small smile as I pulled up his scans on the computer screens that hung on
my wall.
“Your
MRI shows that you have an ependymoma tumor located on your spine.”
“I
have spinal cancer?” he asked as his wife grabbed his hand.
“I’m
going to need to do a needle biopsy and remove a small piece of the tissue and
send it to our pathology lab to confirm, but in most of these cases, they are
benign.”
 “So is that why I’ve been having back pain and
the other symptoms?” he asked.
“Yes.”
“Even
the loss of bladder control?”
“Yes.”
I lightly smiled.
“Thank
God. Now what?”
“I’ll
need to go in and remove it. The good news is that where it’s located on the
spine, I’m positive I will be able to remove the entire tumor. Once I do,
you’ll recover and be good to go and live your life. If, for some unknown
reason, I can’t remove the entire tumor, then you’ll most likely have to
undergo radiation to destroy the rest of it.”
“What
are my chances you can remove the entire thing?” he asked.
“I’d
say ninety-eight percent.” I smiled.
He
exhaled a deep breath.
“Thank
you, Dr. Finn.”
“Don’t
thank me yet. I would like to admit you, run some bloodwork, and do the needle
biopsy and get it sent down to the lab. Come tomorrow, I’ll go in and remove
the tumor. Sound like a plan?”
“Yeah.
Sure. I’ll do anything at this point to alleviate this pain.”
“Good.
I’ll send my nurse in and she’ll take care of everything. Once your bloodwork
comes back, we’ll set you up for the biopsy. So I’ll see you in a while.” I
patted his shoulder.
I
walked out to the nurses’ desk and stood in front of Claire while she typed
away at her computer.
“Yes,
Dr. Finn?” She glanced up at me.
“Let’s
get a basic metabolic panel, CBC with Diff, and a type and screen on Mr.
Jeffery Bind, stat. I’ll need you to get him admitted and prepped for a needle
biopsy of a tumor on his spine.” I glanced at my watch. “I have dinner plans at
eight, so let’s get moving.”
“Of
course, Dr. Finn.”
“And
who may I ask do you have dinner plans with at eight o’clock?” Renata asked as
she walked up to me.
“Are
you spying on me?” I smirked.
“No.
I’m up here to talk to a patient and I couldn’t help but overhear.”
“To
answer your question, I have dinner plans with a colleague.”
“That
colleague better not be Dr. Harper.” Her brow raised before she walked away.
I
sighed as I looked over at Claire, who was snickering.
“Labs,
now!” I commanded as I walked away.
****
Mr.
Bind’s biopsy was done and sent down to the lab. Looking at my watch, I saw it
was seven forty-five. I quickly changed out of my scrubs and into my clothes and
headed down to the ER. When I walked into the doctor’s lounge, Grace had just
grabbed her purse and shut her locker.
“You’re
on time.” She smiled. “And it’s a good thing because I’m starving. Where are we
going?”
I let
out a chuckle. “There’s this great restaurant not too far from here called
Rosie’s. The owner is a friend of mine, and I was able to get us a reservation
for eight thirty.”
“Sounds
good. Let’s go.” She grinned as she placed her purse over her shoulder.
We
walked out to my car, a black convertible Porsche 911, and climbed inside.
“Nice
car.” Grace smiled. “Very California doctor-ish.”
“Thanks.
I like it. Are you looking at cars? I have a friend who owns a dealership.”
“Already
bought one. Picked it up yesterday right when I landed.”
“You’re
very organized.” I smirked as I glanced over at her. “What did you buy?”
“A
2018 Volkswagen Beetle convertible.”
I
couldn’t help but let out a light laugh.
“What’s
so funny?” she asked.
“I can
totally see you driving one of those. And by the way, it’s so very California not
doctor-ish.”
“I
always wanted one, but living in New York, I didn’t need a car because I rarely
drove. I walked, took a taxi, or rode the subway. I’m cool. What can I say?”
She smirked.
I
pulled up to the valet and climbed out of the car.
“Nice
to see you again, Dr. Finn.”
“Thanks,
Carl. Take care of her.” I threw him the keys.
We
stepped inside the restaurant and were immediately seated in a quiet booth in
the corner, just as I requested.
“Compliments
of Mr. Pines.” The waitress smiled as she brought us a bottle of Cabernet and
poured some in our glasses.
“Thank
you, Kiera.” I smiled.
“It’s
good to see you again, Dr. Finn. I’ll give you two some time to look over the
menu.”
“Aren’t
you quite a popular little cookie.” Grace smirked. “I take it you dine here often?”
“I
do.” I picked up my glass and held it up. “Welcome to Los Angeles, Dr. Harper.
I hope the city and your job meets your expectations.”
“Thank
you, Dr. Finn.” She smiled as she brought her glass to mine.







Chapter Seven

Grace
I
needed to be very careful. If I wasn’t, I’d end up sleeping with him, and I
wasn’t about to make that mistake again. Not that it was a mistake that night
in New York. It wasn’t. But now, since we worked together, it would be. I had a
rule. Never get involved with a co-worker, no matter how sexy and nice he was.
It doesn’t end well. I’d seen it with many of my co-workers throughout the
years.
“Tell
me. Which hospital did you work at in New York?” Jamieson asked.
“Manhattan
Memorial. It’s where I did my residency and my trauma fellowship.”
“Interesting.
That’s a very well-respected hospital. Who did you do your fellowship under?”
“Dr.
Ryan Knowles.”
“I
know him. He’s an excellent surgeon. Come to think of it, didn’t Renata used to
work at Manhattan Memorial?”
“She
did. I was her resident for three years before she took the job at
Cedars-Sinai.”
“Good
to see you, Jamieson.” A handsome man smiled as he walked over to our table.
“Hi,
Craig. I’d like you to meet Dr. Grace Harper. She just moved to Los Angeles and
today was her first day at Cedars-Sinai. Grace, this is Craig Pines, the owner
and chef of this outstanding restaurant.”
“Nice
to meet you, Grace.” He smiled as he extended his hand.
“Thank
you, Craig. You have a beautiful restaurant.”
“Thank
you. What kind of doctor are you?”
“She’s
a trauma surgeon, right out of New York,” Jamieson chimed in.
“Wow.
Trauma surgeon? Congratulations. Do you two know each other from New York?” He
waved his finger.
“Yeah.
Sort of.” I smirked as I glanced at Jamieson.
“Well,
welcome to Los Angeles. I better get back in the kitchen. I just wanted to say
hi.”
“Thanks,
Craig. I’ll talk to you later.”
“It
was nice to meet you.” I smiled. “He seems nice.” I picked up my wine glass.
“He is
and so is his wife, Maddy. I was at their wedding. Maddy’s father is one of the
anesthesiologists at the hospital. You’ll meet him soon enough.” He smiled.
“Now back to my questions. Where did you go to med school?”
“Columbia.
You?”
“Harvard.
Graduated at the top of my class.”
“Me
too.” My brow arched.
The
corners of his mouth curved up into a smile.
“I’m
sure your parents are very proud of you,” he spoke as he picked up his wine
glass.
I
shifted in my seat and looked down.
“They would
have been,” I softly spoke. “They died when I was ten years old.”
“I’m
sorry, Grace.”
“Thanks.
That was twenty years ago. I’m sorry, but I have to ask, how old are you?”
He
chuckled before taking a sip from his glass.
“I’m
thirty-three. Why?”
“I’m
just trying to figure out—”
“I
know what you’re asking. I entered Harvard at fifteen.”
“Are
you some kind of genius?” I smirked.
“I
am.” He smiled. “And if we’re being totally open with each other, I suspect you
are too.”
“What’s
your I.Q.?” I asked.
“142.
Yours?” His eye narrowed.
“142
with an eidetic memory. I entered college when I was sixteen. Finished it in
three years versus four. Went to med school and finished that in three years
and then did my residency and trauma fellowship.”
“Fascinating.
What I wouldn’t give right now to crack open your skull and take a look at your
brain.” He grinned.
“How
romantic of you.” I laughed. “What about your parents? I’m sure they’re very
proud of their genius boy.”
The
humor on his face turned serious as he cleared his throat and finished off his
wine. 
“My
father is a narcissistic bastard and I don’t want to talk about my mother.
Let’s leave it at that.”
“Sure.
Okay.” My brows furrowed. “I’m sorry.”
“Don’t
apologize. I asked you first, so it was only natural for you to ask me.”
While
we were eating our dinner, I heard my phone ding with a text message. Pulling it
from my purse, my stomach sank when I saw who it was from.
“I stopped by the hospital today to
see you and Jesse told me you quit. Then I went to your apartment and Mrs.
Leeds told me you moved out. You asked for two months and I gave it to you.
Where the hell are you? I need to see you, Grace.”
I took
in a deep breath and placed my phone back in my purse.
“Are
you okay?” Jamieson asked.
“Yeah.”
I looked at him.
“You
seemed bothered when you looked at your phone.”
“No.
Not at all.” I lied.
The
waitress walked over and set the bill on the table. At the same time, Jamieson
and I reached over, my hand placed on his. His brow arched as he looked at me.
“What
are you doing?” he asked.
“Paying
for my half.”
“The
hell you are. Dinner was my idea, remember?”
“Yes. And
to quote you, ‘I was thinking that maybe we could grab some dinner together.’
You didn’t say ‘I want to take you to dinner.’ There’s a difference.”
His brows
furrowed as he opened his mouth, but no words came out.
“I
specifically said that a proper welcome to Los Angeles was in order. That’s
what I’m doing. I’m welcoming you to Los Angeles by treating you to dinner.”
“This
isn’t a date,” I spoke.
“No,
it’s not a date. It’s me, a new friend and co-worker, welcoming you to Los
Angeles.”
I sat
across from him and narrowed my eye as I slowly removed my hand from his.
“Thank
you.” I nodded.
“You’re
welcome.” A smirk formed on his lips.
“And
by the way,” I scooted out of the booth, “you forgot to say that you were my
one-night stand.”
He let
out a chuckle as we walked out of the restaurant and waited for the valet to
bring around his car.
“I’m
not having sex with you,” I spoke as I looked over at him.
“Why
not?” The corners of his mouth curved upwards.
“Because.
This is my new life and that doesn’t include sex with people I work with. I
have rules, Dr. Finn.”
“So
you’re saying you had sex with your co-workers at Manhattan Memorial in your
old life?”
“No. I’ve
never had sex with anyone at Manhattan Memorial. Like I said, I have rules.
What happened between us in New York was a one-time thing during my old life.”







Chapter Eight

Jamieson
“You’re
really confusing me with this whole ‘old life-new life’ business. What happened
to you that you up and left New York to start a new life? Was it because of
some guy?” I glanced over at her.
“Remember
at dinner when you told me that you didn’t want to talk about your mother?
Well, I don’t want to talk about my old life back in New York.”
“Then
answer me this. Have you ever lived in California before?”
“I
did. Up until I was ten years old. Why?”
I
pulled up to her apartment building.
“It’s
just a comment Renata made.”
“What
did she say?”
“She
was warning me to stay away from you and she just mentioned that it was going
to be hard on you as it is being here.”
“My
parents were killed here in a car accident,” she spoke.
“Gee, I’m
sorry, Grace.”
“Like
I told you and my Aunt Cora, that was twenty years ago.”
She
opened the door, climbed out, and headed for the door.
“Your
Aunt Cora?” I asked as I climbed out and walked her up.
“She
was the one who took me in and raised me. Why was Renata warning you to stay
away from me?” she asked as her brows furrowed.
“You
know Renata. Playing Mama Bear and being protective of the resident she raised.”
A
light smile crossed her mouth as she placed her hand on my chest.
“I
don’t need protection and I’m exhausted. Thank you for dinner, Jamieson.”
“You’re
welcome, Grace.” I took in a deep breath. “Have a good night.”
“You
too.” The corners of her mouth curved upwards as she opened the door and
stepped inside.
I
stood there with my hands tucked into my pants pockets and watched her until
the door shut. Walking back to my car, I thought about how I couldn’t believe
she wouldn’t have sex with me. But it was all good. I’d make sure she broke her
rule and she’d be in my bed sooner or later. Sooner being my goal.
****
Grace
I
stepped into my apartment, threw my keys on the counter, and laid across my
bed. Holding my phone in my hand, I brought up Sam’s text message, and with
much hesitation, I replied.
“I got a new job and I moved away
from New York. Please don’t contact me again.”
Instantly,
he wrote me back.
“You moved out of the state? WTF,
Grace? I gave you what you asked. I didn’t bother you at all. Please, talk to
me.”
“I will never talk to you again. Go
get some help, Sam. If you have a shred of decency left in you, you’ll do
what’s right. Like I said, don’t contact me again. You are my past mistake and
that’s where you’re staying.”
I hit
the send button and then blocked his number. My heart ached as a tear fell down
my cheek. I wasn’t doing this again. I wouldn’t let myself hurt over him
anymore. I wiped my eyes, went into the bathroom, and got ready for bed. As I
was lying there, I picked up the picture of me and my parents that was sitting
on my nightstand. Memories of the time we had as a family here haunted me. I
missed them both so much. I set the picture back on my nightstand, and when I
closed my eyes, my pager went off. It was the hospital asking me to call them.
“It’s
Dr. Harper. You paged me?”
“Dr.
Finn needs you to call him right away. Let me know when you’re ready to take
down his number.”
I
frowned as I grabbed a piece of paper and a pen from the drawer of my
nightstand.
“I’m
ready.” I took down his number as she rattled it off. “Thank you.”
“He
said it’s very important.”
I
dialed his number and after two rings, he answered.
“Dr.
Finn.”
“Dr.
Finn, it’s Dr. Harper. You had the hospital page me?”
“I did,
Dr. Harper. Thank you for calling so promptly.”
“What’s
going on?” I asked.
“Nothing.
I just forgot to ask you for your phone number earlier.”
“You
told the hospital to page me so you could get my number?” I let out a light
laugh.
“Yes.
Like I said, I forgot to get it earlier.”
“You
just couldn’t have asked me for it in the morning?”
“I
could have, but why wait when I could get it now? Good night, Dr. Harper.”
“Good
night, Dr. Finn.” I smiled as I ended the call and stored his number in my
phone.
****
Jamieson
I
smiled as I set my phone down and sipped the drink in my hand while I listened
to the waves of the ocean crash against the shore. I liked Grace. I liked her
enough to have sex with her on a regular basis. No strings, no attachment. We
were doctors, and we didn’t have time for anything but sex when we needed it.
All I had to do was get her to agree. The only thing standing in the way was
her stupid rule about sleeping with co-workers. Come on, who didn’t sleep with
their co-workers? I finished off my drink and went inside.
The
next morning, after my rounds, I went into my office before surgery and called
Dr. Ryan Knowles.
“Dr.
Finn, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
“Dr.
Knowles, how are you?”
“I’m
good, Jamieson.”
“Listen,
I understand you had Grace Harper under your fellowship.”
“I
did. Brilliant woman and surgeon. It broke my heart when she left. She’s over
there with you guys now, right?”
“Yes.
I performed surgery with her yesterday and she’s very good. She told me she
studied under you.”
“One
of the best damn trauma surgeons in the country. This hospital suffered a great
loss.”
“Do
you know why she left?” 
“Apparently,
Renata made her an offer she couldn’t refuse. Damn that woman.” He chuckled.
“Why are you asking?”
“Just
curious. I didn’t know if something happened over there to make her want to
leave.”
“Nothing
that I’m aware of. Just Renata taking back her baby.”
I let
out a light laugh.
“Thanks,
Ryan.”
“Jamieson,
Grace is an amazing woman. Don’t give her a hard time over there.”
“I
won’t. I have a surgery I need to perform. We’ll talk again soon.”
I
ended the call and set down my phone. Bringing my index fingers up to my lips,
I leaned back in my chair and started plotting a way to get Dr. Grace Harper
into my bed.







Chapter Nine

Grace
“Good
morning, Jackie.” I smiled.
“Good
morning, Dr. Harper.”
I
walked into the doctors’ lounge and put my things in my locker.
“So
how was your dinner last night with Dr. Finn?” she asked as she followed me
inside.
“It
was good. We had a nice time.”
“Nice?
That was it?” Her eye narrowed at me.
“Yes.
That was it. We had dinner, and then he drove me home.”
“Strange.
Nothing happened, and he was okay with that?” She placed her hand on her hip.
“Of
course.” I let out a light laugh. “Why wouldn’t he be?”
“Because
he’s Dr. Finn. Women don’t just go out to dinner with him. Ever!”
I
shrugged. “I have rules and I told him that.”
“Rules,
eh?”
“I don’t
sleep with co-workers. It’s been a rule since I started my residency.”
“Damn,
girl. Half this hospital is sleeping together. It’s like one big soap opera
around here. Like I said,” she pointed at me, “I can tell we’re going to be
very good friends.”
“I
could use some other friends here, because the only one I seem to have is Dr.
Finn.” I smirked. “Anything going on right now?”
“No. It’s
quiet at the moment,” she replied.
“Good.
I’m going to grab a coffee.”
I
stepped into the elevator and pushed the button to the rooftop. Before reaching
it, it stopped on the sixth floor, and when the doors opened, Jamieson was
standing there.
 “Well, hello. Good morning.” He grinned as he
stepped inside.
“Good
morning.”
He
went to push the button to the rooftop and saw it was already lit up.
“Coffee
run?” he asked.
“Yeah.”
I smiled as I glanced over at him.
“Good,
then we can have our morning coffee together. But I only have a few minutes. I
have surgery.”
The
elevator doors opened and as soon as we stepped onto the rooftop, my pager went
off.
“Looks
like you’ll be having coffee alone. I’m needed in the ER.”
“Probably
better anyway. I would hate for you to think it was a date.” He winked.
“I
don’t do dates, remember?” I smirked.
“That’s
right. You only do one-night stands.” His brow arched.
I
narrowed my eye at him as the elevator doors closed.
“What
do we have?” I asked Jackie when I stepped into trauma room three.
“Mr.
Stone. Thirty-seven-year-old male. Fell from a three-story window. Vitals are
stable. Looks like he has multiple fractures and possible head trauma.”
I put
on a pair of gloves and walked over to him.
“Let’s
get a trauma panel, type and cross, and CT scan. Page Orthopedics and Dr.
Finn.”
“Mr.
Stone, I’m Dr. Harper and I’m going to take good care of you,” I spoke as I
checked his abdominal area and then his eyes.
“Feeling
sad we couldn’t have coffee together?” Jamieson smirked as he stepped into the
room.
“Yes.
It broke my heart.” I rolled my eyes. “Mr. Stone fell from a three-story
window.”
“I didn’t
fall. I jumped,” he spoke.
“And
why would you do that?” Jamieson asked as he examined him.
“Because
my wife cheated on me.”
“Well,
if you really wanted to kill yourself, you’d have to jump from a higher point,”
Jamieson spoke.
I shot
him a look and he shrugged.
“The internet
said three stories was enough if I fell right.”
“Do
you always believe what you read on the internet?” Jamieson asked him. “Dr.
Harper.” He gestured to the hallway.
“I have
surgery. Get the CT scan and let me know what it shows. It looks like it could
be a basilar skull fracture from the look of his eyes. Also, call psych.”
“Sorry,
I was tied up with a patient,” a handsome man wearing a white doctor’s coat
spoke as he stood in front of me and Jamieson.
“Dr.
Harper. This is Dr. Logan Gray. Logan, meet Dr. Grace Harper, the hospital’s
new trauma surgeon.”
“The
pleasure is all mine.” He smiled. “What do we have?” he asked as I followed him
into the room.
“This
is Mr. Stone and he fell from a three-story window. It looks like he has multiple
leg fractures.”
“I
told you I jumped,” he spoke.
“Your
legs don’t look good, Mr. Stone,” Dr. Gray spoke. “It looks like you’re going
to need surgery so I can reset the bones.”
“Dr.
Harper, his blood pressure is 80/60,” Jackie spoke.
“Increase
his saline to 500cc’s.”
I
grabbed the ultrasound transducer and scanned his abdominal area.
“He
has some internal bleeding. Let’s get him up to the OR.”







Chapter Ten

Jamieson
After
I was finished with one surgery, I was paged to another, Dr. Grace Harper’s
patient.
“I’m
here. Did you get that CT scan?” I asked Grace.
“Up on
the monitor, Dr. Finn,” she spoke.
“Just
as I thought. Okay, let’s open up his skull.”
His
pressure started to bottom out and the beeps from the machines were erratic.
“I’ve
got a bleeder and his brain is starting to swell. Get the paddles now,” I said.
“Damn
it,” Grace spoke as she took the paddles and placed them on his chest.
“Charge
to 200. Clear!”
I looked
at the monitor and nothing.
“Charge
to 200 again. Clear! Come on, Mr. Stone. I know how you feel, but it’s not
worth dying over,” Grace spoke.
I
stared at her as she shocked him again and his heart started beating. Grace let
out a deep breath.
“Welcome
back, Mr. Stone,” I spoke as I continued to work on his brain. “Nice work, Dr.
Harper.”
“Can
you try to keep my patient alive?” she asked.
“Doing
my best. How about a drink after work?”
“I’d
love to, Jamieson,” Dr. Gray spoke as he worked on the patient’s legs.
“I
wasn’t asking you, Logan. I was asking Dr. Harper.”
“I’m
your best friend. We always get drinks together. Wait a minute. Is something
going on between the two of you?” he asked.
“Nothing
is going on between us, Dr. Gray. As for a drink, Dr. Finn, the answer is no.”
“Why?”
“Because
you and drinks will get me into trouble. Dr. Reed, can you close for me?” she
asked.
“Of
course, Dr. Harper.”
“I’m
done as well. Close up, Dr. Kerrigan.”
“Yes,
Dr. Finn.”
I took
off my gown and stepped into the scrub room.
“What
did you mean by that comment?” I asked.
“Remember
what happened the last time we had just drinks together?” She smirked.
“Of
course. How could I forget?”
“I
already told you that I’m not sleeping with you again.”
After
we washed out, I followed her to the elevator.
“Come
on, Grace. You have to admit it was damn good.”
The doors
opened and we both stepped inside.
“Yes,
Jamieson, it was good. But that doesn’t change the fact that we work together,
and no matter how good it was, I’m not breaking my rule.”
“We
had dinner together last night and nothing happened.”
“Exactly,
and you’ll do anything you can to get in my pants again. Am I right?” Her brow
raised at me.
I
pulled the stop button on the elevator.
“Yeah.
I will. I’m not a liar and I won’t ever lie to you. I liked the night we had
together back in New York. What’s wrong with wanting to have another night like
that again? You aren’t interested in a relationship, I’m not interested in one,
so why can’t the two of us just have casual sex to unwind from the stress of
our work and call it a day? I can have sex with any woman in this hospital with
the snap of my fingers and without having to beg. But here I stand, wanting it
with you. You should be flattered, by the way.”
She
stood there, staring at me with her head cocked and a perplexed look on her
face.
“What?”
I held out my arms to the side.
She
took in a sharp breath, pushed in the stop button, and the elevator began to
move. As soon as the doors opened, she shook her head at me and stepped out.
“What
did you say to her?” Renata asked as she stepped in and stood next to me.
“I said
nothing.”
“Then
why did she have a disgusted look on her face and shake her head at you?” Her
brow arched.
“Because
I turned her down.” I smirked. “I’m staying away from her like you asked.”
“You’re
so full of shit, Jamieson.” She shook her head as the doors opened and she
stepped out.
I
couldn’t stop thinking about what Grace said to Mr. Stone while she was trying
to restart his heart. She said she knew how he felt and it wasn’t worth dying
over. The pieces were finally starting to come together. She was dating someone
in New York and he cheated on her. Was that all there was to it? Because as far
as I was concerned, that couldn’t have been enough to want to run away and
start a new life.
Shortly
after returning to my office, Logan walked in.
“What’s
going on between you and Grace?” he asked.
“Nothing
is going on.”
“So
then you won’t mind if I ask her out? It’s obvious she doesn’t want to date
you.” He grinned.
“You
go anywhere near her and I will kill you, my friend.”
“Ah
ha. I knew it. What gives?” he asked as he took a seat.
I
sighed as I leaned back in my chair.
“She
was the woman I had sex with my last night in New York.”
“The
one you described as the best night of your life?”
“Yeah.”
I slowly nodded my head.
“Wait,
I’m confused.”
“I
didn’t know she was moving to Los Angeles and she didn’t know I was a
neurosurgeon here. In fact, I didn’t even know she was a doctor.”
“So
that’s what she meant when she said that you and drinks would get her in
trouble.”
“Yep.
She has this stupid rule. No sleeping with co-workers.”
“That’s
dumb. Everyone sleeps with their co-workers,” Logan spoke.
“Apparently
not Dr. Grace Harper. Do you know she has a photographic memory, graduated at
the top of her class at Columbia, and has an I.Q. of 142?”
“That’s
why she won’t have sex with you again. She’s smart.” He grinned.
“I
took her to dinner last night as a welcome to L.A. gesture.”
“No
sex after?” he asked.
“Nope.
Her rule got in the way.”
“Well,
my friend, looks like Dr. Grace Harper is one woman you can’t have with the snap
of your fingers. Forget about her and move on. There are plenty of hot chicks
in this hospital to have sex with. In fact,” he got up from his chair, “I’m going
to go see if Caroline wants to meet me in the on-call room.” He smiled. “I’ll
catch you later, buddy.”
“Remember
what I said! Stay away from Grace.”
“I got
your message loud and clear,” he spoke as he walked out of my office.
I
sighed as I rubbed my forehead.
Logan
Gray was my best friend. We’d known each other since college. We went through
med school together, partied together, roomed together, did our residency
together, and even shared some of the same women. Neither one of us cared, but
we always asked first. That was our bro code. He was like a brother to me.







Chapter Eleven

Grace
I
slipped my key into the lock, opened the door, and flipped the light switch. It
had been a long day and I was tired. As I was taking off my shoes, I heard my
phone ringing from my purse. I grabbed it, but I didn’t recognize the number,
so I didn’t answer it. A few moments later, a voicemail came through, and I
listened to it.
“Grace, it’s Sam. I’m assuming you
blocked my other number since none of my text messages will go through. I know
you told me not to contact you, but I had to. We need to talk now. I’m sorry for
everything. But the one thing I’m not sorry for is loving you. I still love you
and I always will. Please call me. I know we can work this out. I’m not giving
up on us. You’re too important to me. Please tell me which hospital you’re
working at now. If you don’t want to, I’ll meet you anywhere you want.
Regardless of which state it is. Things are changing. I promise. I know my
promises don’t mean anything to you after what I’d done, but I need you to
trust me on this. Please, call me.”
The
sound of his voice made my stomach churn as anger filled me. I deleted the voicemail,
blocked his number, and threw my phone down on the counter. Damn him. Why couldn’t
he leave me alone? I raked my hands through my hair as I paced around the
apartment. Walking to the refrigerator, I pulled out the wine and took a sip
from the bottle. Suddenly, my phone dinged with a text message and my heart
sank to my belly. Looking at it, I saw that I had a message from Jamieson.
“Just wondering if you might have
changed your mind about that drink?”
I took
another sip of wine from the bottle as I stared at his message. I thought about
his smile, which was constantly in my head. Damn him for having such a sexy
smile. Thoughts of that night played in my mind and my body started to react.
Flutters I felt down below took over and I needed something to make me feel
better. I needed some awesome sex and I knew Jamieson could give that to me.
Was the risk worth it? Was the sex worth breaking my rule? I took another
drink, set the bottle down, and picked up my phone. Fuck it. It was only sex.
He wanted nothing more from me and I wanted nothing more from him.
“Yeah. I did change my mind. Come
to my apartment and we can have that drink. I’m in apartment 3C.”
“I’m on my way.”
I
closed my eyes, took in a deep breath, and put the wine away, since I was on
call. I went to my bedroom and changed into a pair of gray sweatpants and a
white tank top. I wasn’t getting dressed up for him when I knew my clothes
would be coming off pretty much when he walked through the door.
About
twenty minutes later, my apartment buzzer rang, and I pushed the button and let
him in. I opened my door just as the elevator dinged and he stepped off it.
“Hi.”
He smiled as he walked down the hallway. “I’m happy you changed your mind.”
The
minute he approached the door, I grabbed his shirt and pulled him inside,
smashing my mouth against his.
“Whoa.”
He grinned as he broke our kiss.
“Just
shut up and fuck me,” I spoke as I began unbuttoning his shirt.
“Grace,
are you sure?”
“Keep
talking and I might change my mind.”
His lips
met mine as we locked into a passionate kiss. My fingers successfully
unbuttoned his shirt as I slid it off his shoulders. He bent down and swooped
me up in his arms.
“Where’s
the bedroom?” he asked.
“Down
the hallway. Second door on the right.” I kissed him again as my arms wrapped
tightly around his neck.
He set
me on the floor in front of my bed as his fingers grasped the bottom of my tank
top and he pulled it over my head. My body was on fire as my skin trembled at
his touch. He kicked off his shoes and took down his pants as I slid mine off
my hips and stood there in nothing but my bra and panties.
“You
are truly beautiful.” He smiled as he brought his hand up to my face and gently
kissed my lips.
He
wrapped one arm around me, and with one swift movement, he unclasped my bra and
took it off, letting it drop to the floor by our feet. Our tongues collided as
he reached for my panties and slid them off my hips, wasting no time dipping
his finger inside me. I gasped as his tongue traveled to my neck and softly
stroked it while his finger explored me. My hand wrapped around his hard cock
and with a firm grip, I moved it up and down. A moan escaped him, turning me on
more than I already was.
“My God,
you’ve got me so hard,” he moaned.
He
took my hand and removed it from his cock and gently laid me down on the bed.
His mouth traveled to my breasts as he took each hardened nipple in his mouth,
rolling his tongue around, heightening the vibrations that needed taming down
below. I let out several pleasurable moans as his hand traveled down my body
and once again his finger dipped inside. Once he had pleasured my breasts, his
tongue slid down my torso and kept going until it reached my clit. The things
this man could do was indescribable. He took me away from this world and put me
into a place of euphoria as my body quivered and an orgasm soared through me.
He
brought his mouth to mine, letting me taste myself on his lips before climbing
off me and putting on a condom. I was still trying to come down from the orgasm
when he slid himself inside me. My legs wrapped around his waist as he slowly
moved in and out. Light moans took over both of us as he hovered over me and
our eyes locked onto each other’s. There was something in that moment that
frightened me, but I quickly pushed it out of my mind and enjoyed the
fulfillment he was giving. He pulled me up and rolled me on top of him so I
could be in control. My hips moved back and forth as his hands fondled my
breasts and I leaned as far back as I could. This was exactly what I needed,
and in that moment, I didn’t care about the consequences. The only thing I
focused on was how good he made me feel.
“You’re
going to come again. I can feel it,” he moaned as his hands gripped my breasts.
I let
out a loud moan as another orgasm tore through me. He waited until I was
finished and then locked my hips down with his hands and thrusted in and out of
me as hard as he could until he exploded inside me, straining with each sexual
moan that came from him. I leaned down and softly kissed his lips before
collapsing on his body. We were both heated, and our skin melted into each
other’s. My heart was racing, and my breath was erratic. As soon as we both
settled down, I climbed off him and laid my head on my pillow. The corners of
his mouth curved upwards as he brought his hand to my cheek and softly stroked
it. Neither one of us said a word.
He
climbed out of bed and disposed of the condom in the bathroom. I watched as he
walked back into the bedroom, his cock still semi-hard.
“I can
stay if you’d like,” he spoke.
“Sure.
It’s late and we both have to be at work early.”
He
climbed under the covers and wrapped his arm around me.
“I
think this was a hell of a lot better than a drink.” He smirked. “What happened
to you, Dr. Harper?”
“I was
horny, and since you’re the only guy I really know in Los Angeles, I used you.
Plain and simple. I’m not going to sugar coat it. I needed sex and I knew you
would give it to me since you’d been practically begging for it since I got
here.”
He let
out a chuckle. “Okay, then. I don’t mind being used by you. But what happened
to your rule?”
“I
guess I broke it. Just because we had sex, it doesn’t mean things need to be
awkward with us at work, right?”
“Of
course not. There will be no awkwardness on my end at all.”
“Good,
because there won’t be any on my end either. I’m going to sleep. It’s been a
long, hard day saving lives and I have new residents joining me tomorrow, so I
need to be sharp and ready for them. Plus, I’m on call tonight.”
“New residents,
eh?” He laughed. “Good luck with them. Good night, Dr. Harper.”
“Good
night, Dr. Finn. By the way, no one is to know about this. No one at all.
Understand?”
“I
totally understand. My lips are sealed.”
I
rolled over as his arm stayed locked around me. As I closed my eyes, regret
started to seep in. What did I do?







Chapter Twelve

Grace
I was
sound asleep, drifting in and out of a dream and only hearing the words “Time
of death.” My eyes flew open as the beeping and buzzing noise from my pager drowned
out the words as my heart raced at an unbearable speed.
“Is
that mine or yours?” Jamieson asked in a sleepy voice.
“Mine.”
I
reached over and grabbed my pager from the nightstand.
“I
have to go. There’s a trauma coming in,” I spoke as I climbed out of bed.
“Do
you need me to help?” he asked.
“No.
Go back to sleep. I’ll leave my key on the counter. Lock up when you leave.”
“Will
do.” He rolled over and went back to sleep.
I
brushed my teeth, threw my hair up in a ponytail, got dressed, and flew out the
door.
“What
do we have?” I asked as I entered trauma room one and put on a pair of gloves.
“Twenty-five-year-old
male with three gunshot wounds to the abdomen. BP is holding in the low eighties.”
“Hi
there. I’m Dr. Harper. Can you tell me your name?”
“Chris,”
he mumbled in pain.
“Dr.
Harper, there’s a lot of blood in his urine,” Dr. Cortez, one of the residents,
spoke.
“One
of the bullets must have hit his kidney. Call the OR and let them know we’re on
our way up. Dr. Cortez, you can scrub in.”
“Thanks,
Dr. Harper.”
As I
was scrubbing in, I let out a yawn. Thoughts of Jamieson sleeping in my bed, in
my apartment ran through my head. This was not how my new life was supposed to go.
I shook my head as I finished scrubbing in and then walked into the operating
room and performed surgery on my patient. Three bullets out with one kidney and
one lung to go with them.
“Dr.
Harper, the patient’s girlfriend is in the waiting room,” one of the nurses
spoke.
“Thank
you. I’ll go talk to her. Can you close for me, Dr. Cortez?”
“Of
course, Dr. Harper.”
I
sighed as I removed my scrub gown, mask, and cap, and scrubbed out before
heading to the waiting room.
“For
Chris Major?” I asked.
“How
is he?” a frightened young woman in her twenties asked.
“He’s
stable. He had three gunshot wounds to the abdomen. One of the bullets traveled
and lodged in his lung and another one nicked his kidney. We had no choice but
to remove his right lung and his left kidney.”
“Oh my
God!” she cried as she placed her hands over her mouth.
“I
know it sounds scary, but Chris can live a full life with only one lung and
kidney.”
“Can I
see him?”
“In a
few minutes, you can. I’ll send Dr. Cortez out to get you as soon as Chris is
in his room.” I gave her a small smile.
As I
was walking back to the ER, a police officer stopped me.
“Excuse
me, are you Dr. Harper?”
“Yes.
I am.”
“I’m Officer
Wade and I need to speak with your patient, Chris Major. We have some questions
for him regarding the shooting.”
“You
can talk to him when he’s awake, officer. But that won’t be for a while.”
“I’ll
wait, then.”
I gave
him a nod and talked to Darcy behind the desk.
“I’m
going to the on-call room to get some sleep. Page me if you need me. My shift
starts in three hours.”
“Okay,
Dr. Harper.” She smiled.
I lay on
the pillow and placed my hands behind my head. As I stared up at the ceiling, I
thought about the dream I had. The same dream that used to plague me as a
child. It had been years since that dream invaded my sleep and I knew it had
something to do with being back in Los Angeles and this hospital.
****
Jamieson
I
climbed out of bed, and being the gentleman that I was, I made it for her.
Pulling on my pants, I ran down to where my car was parked and grabbed my bag
with a change of clothes from it. After I showered, I got dressed and noticed a
picture of her and her parents sitting on the nightstand. I picked it up and
looked at it. It was taken on the Santa Monica Pier and she couldn’t have been any
more than ten years old. Suddenly, I heard a phone beep and it wasn’t mine.
Looking around, I noticed her phone sitting on the dresser. Picking it up to
put it in my pocket, I noticed there was a text message on her lock screen.
“Stop blocking my numbers and call
me! I need to.”
That
was all the message showed. Who was she blocking? I really needed to find out
what was going on with her. I shoved her phone in my pocket, grabbed my bag and
her key off the counter, and headed to the hospital.
“Good
morning, Jackie.” I smiled as I walked into the ER.
“Good
morning, Dr. Finn.”
“Where
can I find Dr. Harper? I need to give her key back and she left her phone on
her dresser.” I winked with a smirk.
Jackie
sat behind the desk and narrowed her eye at me.
“She’s
sleeping in the on-call room. Her shift doesn’t start for another thirty
minutes. You can leave her key and her phone with me and I’ll make sure she
gets them,” she spoke with a slight attitude.
“No
need. I’ll give them to her. Have a great day.” I grinned.
I
walked to the on-call room, and when I opened the door, Grace opened her eyes.
“Good
morning,” I spoke. “Sorry if I woke you.” I pulled her key and phone out of my
pocket. “I was just going to set these down.” I held them up.
“Thanks.”
She yawned and sat up. “I didn’t realize I left my phone at home. Thanks for
bringing it.”
“You’re
welcome.” I walked over and took a seat on the edge of the bed. “When I picked
up your phone to put it in my pocket, you had a text message from someone
asking you to stop blocking their number.”
She
closed her eyes for a moment and took in a deep breath.
“You
read my text message?”
“Not
really. That was all I could see. It was on the lock screen. You can change
that setting to where it only shows the number or the name. Who is he?” I asked
as I handed her the phone.
“Just
an ex-boyfriend who won’t get the hint.”
“I
see. Is he the reason you left New York?”
“Listen,
Jamieson,” she spoke as she got up from the bed. “I’m not talking about this.
Okay? I need coffee bad.”
I
followed her out of the room and onto the elevator.
“How
was your trauma last night?” I asked as I pushed the button to the rooftop.
“Three
gunshot wounds to the abdomen. I had to remove a lung and kidney.”
“Eventful
night, I would say.”
She
sighed as she stepped off the elevator and walked over to the coffee station.
“Seriously,
Grace. Who is he? He had to do something pretty bad for you to pack up and move
across the country to get away from him.”
“Jamieson,
leave it alone. I’m not talking about this.”
Her
pager went off.
“Damn
it. I have to go. It’s my patient from last night.”
I took
my coffee to my office and grabbed my patients’ charts so I could start my
morning rounds. I was going to find out who this guy was and why she left New
York.







Chapter Thirteen

Grace
After
stabilizing my patient, I went down to the ER and found Jackie sitting behind
the desk.
“You look
tired,” she spoke.
“I’m
fine.” I smiled.
She
sat there and glared at me.
“What?”
I asked.
“Up
all night with Dr. Finn?” Her brow raised. “Don’t try to deny it, Grace. He
stopped by here earlier looking for you. He said he needed to give you your phone
and key.”
I took
in a deep breath. Damn him.
“Fine.
He came over last night.”
“I
can’t believe you caved.” She cocked her head.
“It
wasn’t the first time. Please don’t tell anyone,” I begged.
“I
won’t, but what do you mean it wasn’t the first time?”
“We
met in New York and had sex the night before I left to come here.”
“What?!”
she exclaimed.
“Shh...We
met in a bar and we were never supposed to see each other again. I didn’t know
he was a neurosurgeon and I certainly didn’t know he worked at this hospital.
Imagine the shock.”
“Damn,
Grace.”
“Tell
me about it. I vowed it wasn’t going to happen again, but I had a weak moment.
After all, look at him.”
“Trust
me, I have. I get it. But you broke your rule. You let Dr. Jamieson Finn break
your rule.”
“I
know.” I placed my hands on my head. “It’s not going to happen again.”
“Sure
it won’t.” She pursed her lips. “By the way, your new residents are waiting for
you in the conference room.” She handed me three file folders.
“Thanks.”
As I
was walking down the hall, I quickly examined their files. Pushing open the
conference room door, I stepped inside and introduced myself.
“Good
morning, I’m Dr. Harper. Welcome to Cedars-Sinai. It’s nice to meet you, Dr.
Meadows, Dr. Sanders, and Dr. Adler.” I smiled. “You’re with me for your trauma
rotation. Trauma can be tricky, so you need to be on your game at all times.
We’re here to save lives people. So let’s go save some.”
I
walked out of the conference room, my residents following behind.
“Dr.
Harper, we have a trauma coming ten minutes out. Surfing accident.”
“Okay.
Let’s get ready,” I spoke as I looked at my residents and we headed outside to
wait for the ambulance.
The
ambulance pulled up and I ran over and opened the doors.
“What
do we have?” I asked.
“Twenty-four-year-old
male, abdominal trauma, possible head injury. BP 90/50. Pulse is 126. You ready
for this?” the paramedic asked.
“Oh my
God,” Dr. Sanders shrieked before she hit the ground.
“I
need some help out here. I have a resident down!” I yelled.
“Jackie,
where am I?” I shouted as we raced the stretcher inside.
“Trauma
three,” she replied.
“Anyone
else going to faint on me? Because if you are, I suggest you leave now! Call
the OR and tell them we’re on our way! I need as much O negative as you can get
from the blood bank,” I spoke to Sara, one of the ER nurses.
“His
BP is dropping, Dr. Harper.”
“He’s
lost a lot of blood. Push one of epi and get me the crash cart.”
He flatlined.
“Charge
to 200. Clear.” I shocked him and looked at the monitor. “Dr. Adler, start
compressions. “Charge to 250. Clear.” I shocked him again. 
“We
got a rhythm,” Dr. Adler spoke.
“Let’s
get him upstairs. Dr. Adler, you can scrub in.”
We ran
down the hallway and to the elevator. Everyone was staring in shock as they saw
part of his surfboard and intestines sticking out of his abdomen.
“Dr.
Harper, there’s blood coming out his ears,” Dr. Adler spoke.
“Page
Dr. Finn, stat, and tell him to meet us in the OR.”
Dr.
Adler and I were scrubbing in when Jamieson walked in.
“You
paged me?” he asked.
“Surfing
accident.”
Jamieson
looked through the glass at the patient and then over at me.
“Damn.
Is that part of his surfboard?” he asked.
“Yes.
He has blood coming from his ears. There’s probably an intercranial bleed
somewhere. They’re getting the CT now.”
“Looks
like I’m scrubbing in with you.” He smiled. “We really have to stop meeting
like this.”
I
rolled my eyes as I looked over at Dr. Adler and she was staring at Jamieson.
“Hello.”
He grinned as he started scrubbing in. “And you are?”
“Dr.
Adler.” She smiled like a school girl in love.
“She’s
my new resident,” I spoke. “Let’s get in there, Dr. Adler.”
I
walked into the operating room, where the scrub nurse put on my surgical gown
and gloves. Walking over to the patient, I looked at the scans that were taken.
“The
good news is the board didn’t hit any major organs and it isn’t too deep. We
should just be able to carefully pull it out.”
“I’m
opening up his skull,” Jamieson spoke. “He’s got a brain bleed. If you don’t
pull that board out completely straight, you’re going to pierce something, Dr.
Harper.”
“I
know that, Dr. Finn.” I shot him a look as I could see the smirk beneath his mask.
“Dr. Adler, we’re going to grab the board together and slowly pull it out. But
make sure you pull up straight. One wrong move or slight curve and things will
get a lot worse. On my count. One. Two. Three.” We slowly pulled the board out
and blood shot out everywhere. “Damn it. Hang four units of fresh frozen plasma
and four units of O neg.”
Five
hours in the OR, and my surfboard patient was stabilized. Jamieson stopped the
bleeding in his brain and I fixed his abdomen and put his intestines back in
their proper place.
“Is
his family here?” I asked one of the nurses.
“Yes,
Dr. Harper. They’re in the waiting room.”
****
I sat
in the on-call room with my knees to my chest as I read Sam’s text message.
“Stop blocking my numbers and call
me. I need to talk to you. Please, Grace. You can’t spend the rest of your life
not forgiving me. I screwed up. I know, and I’ll spend the rest of my life
making it up to you. You are the love of my life. Please, I’m begging you to
call me. This is driving me insane. Especially since I don’t know where you’re
at. I need to see you.”
I
deleted the message and blocked the number. Things were quiet in the ER, so I
grabbed a cup of coffee and saw that Jamieson was doing a craniotomy in OR
three. I walked over and sat in the gallery to watch him. Why? I had no idea.
He was a very skilled surgeon and I knew why they said he was the best in the
country. Plus, I couldn’t stop thinking about last night. But I was pissed that
he said something to Jackie.
“He’s
so hot,” one of the nurses sitting next to me spoke to another nurse.
“I
know, and he’s so amazing in bed,” the nurse sitting next to her spoke.
“You
had sex with him?”
“I
did. In the on-call room.”
“God,
what I wouldn’t give to sleep with him.”
“Don’t
expect anything. He’s got a heart of stone, and he has a rule. No commitment
and no strings. Break those rules and you’ll never see him again. That’s why
Julie up and quit.”
“Seriously?”
“Yep.
She somehow got it in her head that she could change him, and she told him she
wanted a real relationship with him. He got mad, told her that she meant
absolutely nothing and that he only used her for sex.”
I sat
there, taking in deep calming breaths as I listened to their conversation.
“Sounds
like a real asshole,” I spoke.
Both
of the nurses looked over at me.
“As
long as you don’t expect anything from him, the sex is worth it,” the nurse
with the black hair spoke.
“Sounds
like Dr. Finn gets around.”
“I’m
sorry, but who are you?”
“I’m
Dr. Harper. The new attending trauma surgeon.”
“Oh.
So you’re not familiar with him.”
“No.”
I smiled. “I just came up here to see the famous Dr. Finn in action.”
“He
does get around. To be honest, who could resist him. I mean, look at him.
Neurosurgeon, hot, sexy, smart, rich. He’s perfect in every way except
emotionally. Like I said, he has a heart of stone. But he can get away with it.
He’s so dreamy.”
I
rolled my eyes as I took a sip of coffee. Getting up from my seat, I walked out
and headed to the ER.







Chapter Fourteen

Jamieson
I
looked up and saw Grace sitting in the gallery watching the surgery. Why would
she do that? I finished my surgery and went to my office. As I was signing off
on patient charts, Renata walked in.
“Good
afternoon, Jamieson.” She smiled.
“Hello,
Renata. How can I help you?”
“I’m
sending you to Las Vegas to speak at a medical conference.”
“Awesome.
I love Vegas.” I grinned. “When am I leaving?”
“Next Thursday.
Your speaking time is Friday morning at nine a.m.”
“Excellent.
I’m off that weekend, so I can have some fun while I’m there.”
She
took in a long sigh.
“As
much as I hate to do this, I’m sending Dr. Harper with you.”
“Why?”
I furrowed my brows.
“Because
she is speaking right after you at ten a.m. The head of the medical conference
called me because he heard Grace was our new trauma attending and he wants her
there to speak about new trauma procedures that are to be put in place in all
of the ER departments across the country. She’s familiar with it because
Manhattan Memorial already has theirs in place.”
“Have
you told her yet?”
“No.
I’m heading down there now. I’m putting you on warning.” She pointed at me.
“You are to stay away from her. No flirting, being charming, nothing. Do you
understand me, Jamieson?”
“And
what am I supposed to do if she wants to take me back to her hotel room and rip
my clothes off? Reject her? Do you know how that would make her feel?” I
smirked.
“I
swear to God, Dr. Finn. You’ve caused enough drama around here with your
manwhore ways and I will not allow you to get to Grace. She’s important to this
hospital and I will not lose her.”
“Do
you honestly think if something happened between us that she would just up and
quit her job? She’s a smart woman, Renata, and frankly, I’m surprised you’re
giving her such little credit. After all, she was your resident. You raised her.”
I smiled.
“She
is smart, but I’ve seen even the smartest women succumb to the likes of guys
like you and your charm. I care about her, Jamieson.”
“Did
you just insult me?” I arched my brow. “Listen, I can’t help it if women fall
all over me. But the one thing I can help is making sure they know exactly what
I don’t want. These women know what they’ll get and what they won’t get when
they consent to having sex with me.”
“Oh my
God, I’ve heard enough.” She put her hand up and began to walk out of my office.
“You
love me, Renata, and you know it!” I shouted before she shut the door.
A
weekend in Vegas with Grace sounded good. It would get us away from the chaos
of this place, we’d have a lot of sex, and I’d finally be able to find out what
happened in New York. I loved how Renata warned me to stay away from her.
Little did she know that Grace was the one using me.
“Hey,
you got a minute?” Logan asked as he walked in my office.
“What’s
up?”
“I
think I’m in trouble.”
“What
did you do?” I cocked my head.
“Riley
told me today that she’s pregnant.” He rubbed his forehead.
“As in
Riley the ICU charge nurse?”
“Yeah.
That’s the one.”
“Wow.
How the hell did you let that happen?” I leaned back in my chair.
“It
was one night. The one time I didn’t use a condom because the only one I had
left broke. She said it didn’t matter because she was on birth control.”
“Either
she lied to you or her birth control failed.”
“She
said she’s keeping it. Fuck, Jamieson. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to
be tied down to a kid. I like Riley but not enough to be her kid’s father.”
“The
truth is, you are the kid’s father. If she’s keeping it, you need to step up
and take responsibility.”
“You
wouldn’t be saying that if you were in my position.”
I let
out a chuckle. “I’m not stupid enough to fuck someone without a condom.”
“Thanks
for your support. I appreciate it.” He scowled.
I got
up from my seat, walked over to him, and placed my hand on his shoulder.
“I do
support you, my friend. All kidding aside, Riley is having your baby. Did she
say she wanted anything else from you?”
“No.
She said all she wants is for me to be a part of the kid’s life.”
“Then
you’re semi off the hook. You can still fuck whoever you want and be a part-time
dad.”
He
sighed and slowly shook his head. My pager went off, and I was needed down in
the CT room.
“I
have to go. I have a consult. Try not to stress over it and take it one day at
a time. And you better be at my house tonight.”
I took
the elevator down to the CT room and found Grace sitting there.
“You
paged?” I smiled.
“Take
a look at this.” She pointed to the images that sat on the screen.
“Damn.
That’s a beautiful tumor right on the temporal lobe.”
“The
patient is a thirty-two-year-old female who had a psychotic episode and went
after her husband with a knife when she accused him of cheating on her. She
actually succeeded and stabbed him in the arm.”
“How
did you know to order a CT on her?”
“When
the paramedics brought her in, her speech was slightly slurred, and she had no
memory of stabbing her husband when it had just happened thirty minutes prior
to the paramedics getting there. I was going to page you, but I knew you were
in surgery.”
“Good
call. I’ll schedule her surgery for tomorrow morning. Get her into a room and
page me and I’ll talk to her and her husband. Is he okay?”
“He’ll
be fine.” She smiled.
“Hey,
did Renata talk to you yet?”
“No.
I’ve been really busy with patients. Why?”
“Just
wondering. She told me she was on her way down to see you.”
“I’m
sure she’ll find me.”
I
began to walk out of the room when I stopped and looked at her.
“I’m
having a few people over for drinks around eight. You can come if you want.
It’ll give you a chance to meet some more people.”
“Thanks.
Maybe I will for a little bit. I’m off tomorrow.”
“Great.
I’ll text you my address.”
I
walked out of the room with a smile on my face, for I knew I’d have her in my
bed before the night was over.







Chapter Fifteen

Grace
“Grace,
there you are,” Renata spoke as she walked up to me.
“Hey,
Renata.”
“Listen,
Robert Conway called, and he wants you to speak at the medical conference in
Las Vegas on the new trauma procedures for the ER.”
“Robert
Conway? Gosh, I haven’t seen him in a long time. When is it?”
“You’ll
leave next Thursday, and you’ll be speaking Friday morning at ten. Now, I know what
next Friday is and I think it would do you some good to not be here.”
I
looked down and tapped the pen I was holding on the counter.
“Another
thing, you’ll be going with Dr. Finn.”
“He’s
speaking too?” I asked.
“Yes.”
She
hooked her arm around mine and we began walking.
“I
know you’re a smart girl and I don’t have to reiterate what we already talked
about regarding him.”
“No,
you don’t.” I bit down on my bottom lip. “Listen, Renata, you don’t have to try
and protect me.”
“I
know I don’t, but I just can’t seem to help it.” She smiled.
“What
is it about Dr. Finn that has you so worried? Do you not like him?”
“On
the contrary. I love Jamieson. He’s highly intelligent and he’s an excellent
surgeon. He’s the youngest doctor we’ve ever had here to head up a department.
He earned it. But, on the personal side, he’s very closed off. He doesn’t let
anyone in or near him. He sleeps around too much and gets women’s hopes up and
then crushes them to the point where they quit. I just don’t want to see that
happen to you. You’re new here and he’ll see you as a challenge and charm his
way into your life. He’ll use you and then things will get messy.”
“I’m a
big girl, Renata.”
“I
know, Grace. I just felt like I needed to have this talk with you.”
“Thank
you. I appreciate it, but you have nothing to worry about.”
****
I
punched Jamieson’s address into my GPS and headed to his house. I pulled up to 4701
Ocean Front Walk Street in Marina Del Rey and stared at the sprawling home that
sat directly on the beach.
“Damn,
Dr. Finn,” I spoke to myself.
Walking
up to the front door, I rang the doorbell and waited for him to answer. A few
moments later, the door opened, and Logan stood there with a smile on his face.
“Grace,
come in.” He waved his hand. “We’re out on the beach having a bonfire.”
“Thanks,
Logan.” I smiled.
“Can I
get you a beer or something?”
“Sure.
A beer sounds great.”
“Jamieson
is out there.” He pointed to the sand where a bunch of people were gathered and
music was playing.
While
Logan was getting my beer, I looked around at the four-thousand-square-foot
home that was impeccably decorated in whites and grays. Logan handed me my beer
and I followed him out to the beach.
“Look
who I brought with me.” He grinned.
“Hello,
Grace.” Jamieson smiled. “Glad you could make it.”
Jamieson
introduced me to a few nurses and doctors that I hadn’t met yet, and I stood
there and wondered how many he’d slept with.
“Dr.
Harper, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” A woman with long red hair smiled
as she walked up to me and extended her hand. “I’m Dr. Gail Edmonds. I work up
in OB.”
“Nice
to meet you Gail.” I lightly shook her hand.
“I’ve heard
a lot about you. I have a friend who works over at Manhattan Memorial. Dr. John
Reddy.”
“Yes,
I know John. We worked together in the ER.”
“He had
nothing but wonderful things to say about you.”
“I’m
happy to hear that. He’s a great guy and an amazing doctor.”
“I
hope you’re talking about me.” Jamieson grinned as he walked over to us.
“You’re
always the talk of the hospital.” Gail winked at him and placed her hand on his
chest.
He
gave her a wink back and it made my belly churn. Yep, he’d slept with her.
“Can I
get you another beer?” Jamieson asked.
“Actually,
I’d like a scotch if you have any.”
“Music
to my ears.” He grinned. “Of course I do. Follow me.”
We
walked back inside his house and he walked over to his bar and poured me a
drink.
“You
have a nice place here,” I spoke. “Did you decorate it yourself?”
“No.”
He laughed. “I wish I could take all the credit, but I had an interior designer
come in.”
He
handed me my drink and tipped his glass to mine.
“Welcome
to my home, Dr. Harper.”
I gave
him a small smile as I brought the glass to my lips.
“Renata
told me about Vegas,” I spoke.
“We’re
going to have a good time. Once we get through the medical conference, of
course. I’m staying the whole weekend since I’m off. How about you?”
“I’m
off too. Renata put me on alert about you.” I smirked.
“Not
surprised. She already slapped me on the hand. But hey, what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas, right?”
After
a few hours, everyone was starting to leave. Grabbing my purse, I pulled my
phone from it and saw another text message from Sam.
“Don’t do this to me, Grace. I
don’t know how much more I can beg you for forgiveness. It’s driving me crazy
not seeing you or talking to you. Please, just call me for fuck sakes.”
“Everything
all right?” Jamieson asked as he walked up behind me.
“Yeah.”
I hurried and closed out of the text message.
“Him
again?”
“Yeah.”
I sighed.
“Sounds
like he’s obsessed with you.”
He
placed his hand on my cheek and softly stroked it.
“You
should change your number.”
My
knees felt weak and I trembled at his touch. Damn those hands.
“I really
should get going.”
“You’ve
been drinking. I think you should stay.” His eyes stared into mine.
“I
only had one beer and a glass of scotch because I knew I had to drive home,” I
spoke in a soft voice as his hand continued to stroke my cheek.
“You
want to stay and you know it. Plus, you owe me.”
“Excuse
me?” I cocked my head.
“Last
night you were horny and you asked me to come over. I did, and I happily
fulfilled your needs. Now tonight, I’m horny and I’m asking you to come to bed
with me.” The corners of his mouth curved upwards.
My
trembling skin and the fluttering down below were too much to bear. I couldn’t
say no. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t. My body wouldn’t let me.
“Okay.”
I softly smiled.
He
took hold of my hand and led me upstairs to his bedroom.







Chapter Sixteen

Grace
I
rolled off him and desperately tried to catch my breath as he climbed out of
bed and walked into the bathroom. I ran my hand over the fabric of his dark
gray satin sheets. I could hear my phone ringing from my purse, which was
sitting on his dresser. Getting out of bed, I covered myself with a throw blanket
that sat on the end of the bed and pulled my phone out. Anger consumed me when
I saw another different number calling.
“What
the fuck do you want?” I shouted as I answered.
Jamieson
emerged from the bathroom and stood in the middle of the room.
“No. You
listen to me, Sam. It’s over. It’s been over since that night. I only told you
two months to give me enough time to get the hell out of New York and away from
you. There’s nothing to talk about! What part of ‘it’s over’ do you not
understand? I don’t care about your damn excuses and I don’t want your apology.
There isn’t anything in this world that could ever make me forgive you! If you
call or text me again, I will press charges for stalking. I’m done. It’s done. This
is the last time you will ever hear my voice!”
I
ended the call and threw my phone on the floor as I stood there with my heart
pounding out of my chest.
“Hey,
are you okay?” Jamieson asked as he walked up behind me and clasped my
shoulders.
I
jerked away from his grip and wiped the tear that was about to fall from my
eye.
“I’m
sorry you had to hear that. I just couldn’t take it anymore.”
“Don’t
apologize. It was quite entertaining.” He smirked. “If he didn’t get the hint
from that conversation, then he’s a complete idiot. What did he do to you?”
I
stood there in front of him, wrapped in a blanket, debating whether or not I
should tell him. A part of me wanted to and the other part of me wanted to keep
it locked tightly away in my mind. I opted to keep it to myself. I wasn’t sure
if I could truly trust him.
“It
doesn’t matter. What’s done is done and things are different now. I’m away from
him, he doesn’t know where I am, and tomorrow, I’m changing my phone number.”
He
sighed, climbed into bed, and patted the empty space next to him.
“Are
you coming?” He smiled.
The
next morning, I awoke to the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Coffee so strong
that I could smell the aroma all the way upstairs. Slipping on one of
Jamieson’s black t-shirts, I walked down to the kitchen, where I found him
sitting at the island eating a bagel.
“Good
morning. I didn’t think you’d be up this early. It’s your day off.”
“Morning.”
“Help
yourself to some coffee. The cups are in the cabinet above the coffee maker.”
“Thanks.
I couldn’t sleep, and I have a lot to do today.”
“My
t-shirt looks great on you.” He took a bite of his bagel.
“Sorry.
I hope you don’t mind.”
“No.
Not at all. It’s sexy.” He winked.
I gave
him a small smile as I poured some coffee into my cup.
“There’s
bagels in the bag over there if you want one.”
“I’m not
hungry. I’ll grab something a little later.”
“I was
going to wake you before I left for the hospital so we could head out together.
I really don’t like anyone in my house when I’m not here,” he spoke.
I took
a sip of coffee and arched my brow at him.
“I
left you in my apartment alone in the middle of the night.”
“I
know and it’s not that I don’t trust you. It’s just a thing I have.”
“So
you’re telling me that if I was still asleep, you were going to wake me up to
kick me out?”
“You
make me sound like an asshole when you say it like that. But, yeah, I was going
to ask you to leave. In a nice way, of course.”
I
couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I rolled my eyes, set my cup on the island,
and went upstairs.
“Grace,
wait a minute,” he spoke as he followed me up. “Are you mad at me? Because that
look you just shot me told me you are.”
“No,”
I spoke in a harsh tone as I took off his t-shirt and threw on my clothes from
yesterday.
“Admit
that you are,” he spoke.
“You
don’t trust me, Jamieson. I get it. You barely know me. It’s fine.” I sat on
the bed and put on my shoes.
“I
just don’t like strangers in my house when I’m not home. That’s all.”
I got
up from the bed, went into the bathroom, and threw my hair in a ponytail.
“That’s
right, I forgot. We are strangers. For some weird and crazy reason, I thought
we were friends.” I grabbed my purse.
As I
walked past him, he grabbed my arm.
“We
are friends.” His eyes stared into mine. “It’s just a thing I have. It’s
nothing personal.”
“Have
a nice day saving lives, Jamieson.”
I
walked out the front door, climbed into my car, and drove to the first
Starbucks I saw. After getting my coffee, I put the top down on my car, turned
up the radio, and merged onto the highway. I was jamming, trying to live in the
present moment and put everything else out of my mind, when I looked in my
rearview mirror and saw the flashing lights of a police car behind me.
“Shit.”
I heavily sighed and pulled over on the shoulder. “Hello, officer.” I smiled
brightly.
“Do
you know what the speed limit is?” he asked in a harsh tone.
“Sixty-five?”
I bit down on my bottom lip.
“Do
you know how fast you were going?”
“Seventy?”
I bit down on my bottom lip again.
“No.
You were doing eighty-five. If you were doing seventy, I wouldn’t have pulled
you over.”
“I’m
sorry, officer. I didn’t realize.”
“I
need your driver’s license and registration.”
I
pulled my license out of my purse, handed it to him, and then reached over and
pulled my registration from my glovebox.
“You
don’t have a California driver’s license? This says New York.”
“Actually,
I was on my way to the DMV to get one. I just moved here, and I haven’t had a
chance to get there.”
“Sure
you were.” His brow arched.
“Listen,
officer. I am really sorry, and I didn’t realize how fast I was going. Back in
New York, I rarely drove. You know, with the taxi cabs and subway, not to
mention the traffic.”
“Doesn’t
matter,” he looked at my license, “Grace Harper. This is California you’re in
now and you were exceeding the speed limit by twenty over.”
“I was
keeping up with traffic.”
“People
love to tell me that. I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to write you a ticket.
Let it be a lesson, since you’re new to driving and all.” He cocked his head.
I
couldn’t believe this. Ugh. So far, this day was sucking big time.
“I’ll
be right back,” he spoke.
He
began walking to his vehicle, when out of nowhere, shots were fired. I immediately
ducked down as a car sped by and someone yelled, “Take that, cop,” and when I
thought it was safe, I sat up. I looked behind me and saw the officer lying on
the ground. I didn’t have time to think about what just happened and I didn’t
have time for my mind or body to process it. Several cars pulled over to the
side. I grabbed my medical bag from the back seat and got out of my car.
“Call
911 now!” I shouted at a man who emerged from his car as I ran over to the
officer who was lying there shaking and bleeding profusely. “I’m a doctor and I
can help you,” I spoke. “Can you tell me your name, because I really don’t want
to keep calling you ‘officer’?”
“John.”
I
checked his vitals, tore open his shirt, and examined the bullet wound that
penetrated his chest. Placing my hand over the wound, I applied pressure to
help control the bleeding.
“The
paramedics are on their way and you’re going to be fine.”
“Is
there anything I can do?” the man who called 911 asked.
“I
need you to go to my car over there and get my cellphone. Hurry.”
He ran
back with my phone and tried to hand it to me.
“I can’t
move my hand from his wound. The passcode is trauma. Go through my contacts
until you see Cedars-Sinai ER, dial them, and put the phone to my ear,” I instructed.
He did
as I asked, and Jackie answered the phone.
“Jackie,
It’s Grace. I’m on the side of the highway with an officer who’s been shot in
the chest. The paramedics are on their way. I need you to page cardio and have three
units of O neg on standby when we get there. Put the order in for a CBC,
electrolytes, and arterial blood gases.”
“Got
it, Grace.”
The
ambulance pulled up and the paramedics ran over with the stretcher.
“We
got it from here, ma’am,” one of the paramedics spoke.
“I’m a
trauma surgeon. He has a gunshot wound to the chest with no exit wound. He’s
bleeding pretty bad and if I remove my hand, he’ll bleed out.”
The
paramedics placed an oxygen mask over him and quickly loaded him into the
ambulance. I rode with them as I kept pressure on his chest and carefully
watched his vitals. John started to cough up blood and his pressure began to
drop.
“His
BP is dropping, Doctor Harper.”
“His
chest is filling with blood. I need to insert a chest tube. Ten-gauge scalpel,”
I spoke as I held out my hand. “Take over applying pressure.”
I
inserted the chest tube and his vitals started to rise. We arrived at the
hospital, where my residents were waiting outside for me as we pulled up.
“BP is
100/80 and pulse is 120. Where’s cardio?”
“Dr.
Williams is in surgery. We paged his resident, but he isn’t answering.”
I
stayed on the stretcher with the patient, continuing to put pressure on the
wound as the paramedics rolled us into the ER. I looked over at the nurses’
station and saw Jamieson staring at me.
“Are
you okay?” he asked as he followed us to trauma room four.
“I’m
fine. I need a portable CT in here now!” I shouted.
Five
hours later and performing surgery with Dr. Williams, a cardiothoracic surgeon,
Officer John was stabilized and ready to be closed up.
“Excuse
me, Dr. Harper, there are some police officers down in the ER that need to
speak to you,” Jamie, one of the nurses, spoke as she walked into the operating
room.
“Tell
them I’ll be down in a minute.”
“Go
ahead, Dr. Harper. I’ll take care of the rest. It was a pleasure doing surgery
with you.” Dr. Williams smiled.
“Thank
you.” I nodded as I took off my scrub cap and gown and walked out of the room.
After
scrubbing out, I went down to the ER, where I saw Jamieson walk out of one of
the rooms and two officers standing at the nurses’ station. Walking up to them,
I introduced myself.
“I’m
Doctor Harper.”
“I’m Officer
James and this is Officer Greggs. Do you have a few minutes to answer some
questions about the incident on the highway?”
“Of
course.”
I
answered their questions the best I could.
“Thank
you for your time, Dr. Harper,” Officer Greggs spoke. “And thank you for saving
John’s life. He’s very lucky you were there. We are all very appreciative of
you.”
“You’re
welcome.” I gave them both a small smile. “By the way, do you think you can
give me a ride back to my car?”
“Yeah,
of course,” Officer James spoke.
“Thank
you. I just need to grab my purse. I’ll be right back.”
I
walked into the doctors’ lounge and Jamieson followed behind.
“So
much for your day off.”
“Yeah.
What can I say? The life of a trauma surgeon.”
“Are
you still upset with me about this morning?”
“It is
what it is. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go.” I walked out of the lounge.







Chapter Seventeen

Jamieson
I
sighed as I watched her walk out of the hospital with the two police officers.
“I
think she’s mad at me,” I spoke as I glanced over at Jackie.
“Why?
What did you do?” Her brow raised.
“She
spent the night at my place last night. By the way, we missed you. You missed
one hell of a get-together. Anyway, she got up this morning and I told her that
I was going to wake her up so we could leave together.”
“Leave
together? Why? It’s her day off. She didn’t have to come to the hospital with
you.”
“I
don’t like people in my home when I’m not there.”
“It’s
Grace. If I recall, she left you in her apartment all night, by yourself.” She
pursed her lips at me.
“It’s
just a thing I have. I told her not to take it personally. But I think she did
anyway.”
Jackie
reached over and hit me with a chart.
“You
idiot. Of course she did. For future reference, when you’re done having sex,
send them home.” She rolled her eyes and walked away.
“Hey,
Jamieson,” Logan spoke. “There you are. I was looking for you.”
“What’s
up?”
“Drinks
tonight? I really need to get my mind off Riley and this baby.”
“Sure.”
I smiled as I patted his shoulder.
After
my shift ended, Logan and I headed to The Dive, a popular bar near the hospital.
Despite its name, it was an upscale place.
“What
can I get you two handsome doctors?” Paige smiled as she walked over to our
table.
“I’ll
have a scotch, Paige,” I spoke.
“And
I’ll have a double scotch and an order of the pretzel bites,” Logan spoke.
“Coming
right up.”
“Seriously,
Jamieson. What am I going to do? I don’t want a kid. Maybe things would be
different if I loved Riley. I barely know her.”
“Then
I suggest getting to know her, since she’s going to be in your life for the
next eighteen years.”
He
leaned forward and placed his forehead on the table.
“That’s
eternity. I feel like I’m being punished.”
“Grace
is mad at me because I was going to kick her out this morning before I left for
work. Plus, I accidentally said that I don’t like strangers in the house when
I’m not home.”
“Are
you really surprised she’s mad? She’s a woman. They always take things the
wrong way. Somehow, it’s always our fault. Just like Riley getting knocked up.
Totally my fault, she said, even though she said it was okay not to use a
condom.”
“Two
scotches and an order of pretzel bites.” Paige smiled.
“Thanks,
Paige,” I spoke.
“Do
you even care if she’s mad at you? It’s not like you’re into her or anything.
Or are you?” Logan’s brow raised.
“No.
Of course not. I like the sex and she’s a nice girl, but that’s it. Renata is
sending us to Vegas next Thursday to speak at a medical conference.”
“Damn.
What I wouldn’t give to go to that. I love Vegas.”
“I
just don’t want things to be awkward with us if we’re spending the weekend
together.”
“She’ll
get over it. They always do,” Logan spoke.
After
a few drinks and appetizers, I headed home. Walking into my bedroom and taking
off my watch, I noticed Grace’s bracelet she wore last night sitting on my
dresser. I picked it up and looked at it. It was one of those Alex & Ani bracelets.
It was silver with a guardian angel charm on it. I pulled my phone from my
pocket and sent her a text message.
“Hi. I just wanted to let you know
that you left your bracelet at my place. I’ll bring it to work tomorrow.”
I set
my phone down on the nightstand, changed into a pair of pajama pants, and went
downstairs to grab my laptop. When I returned to my room, I climbed in bed and
grabbed my phone to see if she replied. She didn’t. Maybe she was sleeping. She
didn’t get much last night, that was for sure, and then she ended up in a
five-hour surgery on her day off. I sat there with my laptop, thought about her,
and wondered if she was on Facebook. I searched her name and found her. As I
stared at her profile picture, I couldn’t help but smile. She definitely was
gorgeous. In fact, I believe she was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. I
scrolled through some of her public posts. There were pictures of her and some
of her co-workers from Manhattan Memorial, and a picture of her and Dr.
Knowles. There were also posts that patients posted on her timeline with a picture
of them with her.
“Best
doctor in the world. I absolutely love Dr. Harper.”
“Doctor
Harper is the best! She helped me when all the other doctors turned me away.”
“I’ll
always be grateful for Dr. Harper. She saved my wife’s life.”
I
clicked on her photos to see if there were any of her and the guy she brutally
told off on the phone. Nothing. Not one picture with her and another guy except
Dr. Knowles. I closed the Facebook tab, shut my laptop, and went to sleep.
****
Grace
I
called my Aunt Cora to let her know that I changed my number.
“Hello,”
she answered.
“Hi,
Aunt Cora, it’s me.”
“Grace.
What number are you calling from?”
“This
is my new number. I had to change it because Sam kept calling and texting me
from a bunch of different numbers.”
“That
piece of shit. I swear to God, if I ever see him.”
I
couldn’t help but laugh.
“How
are you, baby?” she asked. “How is it going in Los Angeles?”
“It’s
going okay. The nightmares are back.”
“I figured
they would return with you being back there. Is it the same dream?”
“Yeah.
The same exact one as always.”
“I
think you should talk to someone there, Grace.”
“I’m
fine, Aunt Cora. They’ll pass.”
I
wanted so badly to tell her about Jamieson, because I always told her
everything. She wasn’t only my aunt, she was my godmother and best friend.
“I’m
sleeping with a guy here,” I blurted out. “He’s a neurosurgeon at the
hospital.”
“Grace,
is that such a good idea? I don’t think you’re ready to get into another
relationship yet.”
“I
don’t want a relationship and I’m not getting into one. Plus, he doesn’t want
one either.”
“Sounds
to me like you’re using sex with him as a coping mechanism.”
“Are
you shrinking me?”
“Maybe.
You’ve been terribly hurt, and you’ve just moved back to the place where you
experienced traumatic events as a child. You’re escaping, my love. Every time
you have meaningless sex with that man, you’re escaping your reality.”
“Aunt
Cora.” I sighed. “Why does everything have to be about psychology?”
“Because
it’s what makes us who we are, darling.”
“And
just for the record, I’d already slept with him in New York on my last night
there. We met in a bar and I wasn’t supposed to see him again. I had no idea
who he was and that he worked at the hospital here. Imagine the shock on my
face when I saw him again.”
“I
see. You know, Grace, rebounds never work out.”
“He’s
not a rebound, Aunt Cora. He’s just a man who’s amazing in bed and makes me
for—” I abruptly stopped.
“Forget
your problems? Forget about Sam? Forget about what happened to you there twenty
years ago?”
Shit. Ugh.
Why did I say that? Why didn’t I just stop at “he’s not a rebound.”
“I get
your point.” I sighed.
“Just
be careful. You need to heal, love, and having sex with this man isn’t going to
heal you. It’s only going to confuse you.”
“I’ll
be careful, and I have to go. It’s been a long day and I’m tired. I’ll talk to
you soon.”
I
ended the call, and within a few moments, my phone rang and it was my Aunt
Cora. I narrowed my eye as I stared at her name on my phone.
“Did
you forget to give me one other piece of advice?” I playfully answered.
“Actually,
the man you’re sleeping with, please don’t tell me it’s Dr. Jamieson Finn.”
“It
is. Do you know him?”
“I do.
We’ve met on several occasions at Mount Sinai here in New York. Grace, of all—”
“Good.”
I cut her off. “Then you know he’s not looking for anything. No relationship,
no girlfriend, no wife, no strings, nothing. Just meaningless sex.”
“And
why do you suppose he’s like that?” she asked.
“I’m going
to take a wild guess and say that he’s not facing reality either? He’s hiding
behind a façade of women and sex? Maybe stemming from a piss poor childhood?
Mommy issues? Daddy issues?”
“Perhaps.
Okay, that’s all I wanted to know. Good night, darling.”
“Wait
a minute. You just can’t call me and say that. What are your thoughts? I need
to know your thoughts, Aunt Cora.”
“He
has a reputation, Grace. But I’m sure you already know that. Men like Jamieson
Finn won’t ever change until they work out their own demons. I know you,
darling. You’re a good person with a good heart and a lot of emotions. I don’t
believe you can just have sex with him and not feel something. Like I said,
it’s way too soon for you to be getting involved with anyone, meaningless sex
or not.”
“I
will take your advice under advisement, Aunt Cora.”
“No
you won’t, Grace. I love you. Good night.” She ended the call.
Having
a shrink for an aunt and substitute mother was exhausting.







Chapter Eighteen

Grace
A few
days had passed, and I hadn’t seen Jamieson at all, which was odd. When I’d
call for a neuro consult, his resident, Dr. Rebecca Lasher, would come down to
the ER. 
“Dr.
Lasher, where’s Dr. Finn?” I asked.
“He’s
in New York. He’s due back today.” She smiled brightly.
“That’s
odd. I wonder why he didn’t tell me.”
“I
don’t know. Are the two of you seeing each other?” she asked.
“No. I
just thought if he was going to be out of town, he’d at least tell me that he
wouldn’t be here when I needed a consult.”
She
shrugged. I glared at her as she walked away.
“You’re
giving Dr. Finn’s resident the evil eye,” Jackie spoke. “Why?”
“No
I’m not.”
“Yes
you are.” She smiled. “She’s pretty.”
“She’s
okay.”
“I
know what you’re thinking. You’re wondering if her and Jamieson are sleeping
together.”
“No,
I’m not. Like I would care anyway. We aren’t a thing. I’m just a little pissed
he didn’t tell me he was going to New York.”
“Why?
If you’re not a ‘thing,’ then why does it matter?”
I
cocked my head and raised my brow at her.
“Come
on, Grace. Don’t. You better not be falling for him. You’ve got that look.”
I
grabbed the patient’s chart out of her hand.
“I
don’t have a look and I’m not falling for him,” I spoke as I turned and walked
away.
I
didn’t like the fact he left without telling me. And I didn’t like the fact
that I felt that way. The truth was it felt weird not seeing him. My shift was
almost over and I needed a neuro consult on a patient of mine. After paging Dr.
Lasher with no answer, I took the chart up to the neuro floor and walked over
to the nurses’ station.
“Have
you seen Dr. Lasher?” I asked. “I need a neuro consult.”
“I
believe she’s in the on-call room,” the nurse spoke.
“Thanks.”
I gave a small smile.
I
walked down the hallway to the on-call room, and when I opened the door, I
found Jamieson and Rebecca in a passionate kiss. Instantly, I felt sick as he
turned his head and his eyes stared into mine.
“I’m
sorry,” I stuttered. “I thought you were in here sleeping, Dr. Lasher. I need a
consult on one of my patients. Please, continue what you were doing. For the
record, I’m not sorry that I interrupted the two of you. Dr. Lasher, the next
time you get a page, you better damn well answer it.” I put my hand up and then
shut the door.
I
scurried down the hallway and into the bathroom. I hid in one of the stalls while
I tried to catch my breath. Tears filled my eyes as I clenched my jaw, trying
to refrain from the screams that wanted to erupt from me. What did I expect? A
little respect? From Dr. Manwhore? Ha. I composed myself, stepped out of the
stall, and stared at myself in the mirror as I rested my hands on the sink.
I
walked out of the bathroom and down to the ER, where I saw Jamieson standing at
the nurses’ station.
“There
you are. We need to talk,” he spoke. “But first, who’s the patient you need a
consult on?”
“We
don’t need to talk about anything,” I spoke harshly. The patient is in room
five. Mrs. Carrington. Here’s her chart.” I handed it to him.
“Aren’t
you going to come with me?” he asked.
I
could see Jackie glaring at us from behind the computer screen. She knew
something was up.
“Grace,
you have a trauma coming in. ETA five minutes. A car crashed into a pedestrian
on a bike crossing the street.”
“Sorry.
I have a trauma coming in.” I smiled. “You’ll be fine with Mrs. Carrington on
your own.”
He shot
me a look and walked away.
“What
the hell is going on?” Jackie asked in a low voice.
“I
just found him and his resident with their lips locked together in the on-call
room.”
“So
you found out the answer to your question.” She rolled her eyes. “I warned you
about him, Grace.”
“Hey,
I know. I’m not upset or anything,” I lied.
“Your
tone of voice and actions towards him lead me to believe otherwise.”
“Nah.
All is good. We had fun and now it’s over. I’m not going to continue having sex
with him. I’m done, and the casual thing is over. Is there really a trauma
coming in?” I looked at my watch.
“No. I
just said that because I could tell you didn’t want to go into the patient’s
room with him.” She smiled.
“Thanks,
friend.” I grinned.
“Where’s
your trauma patient?” Jamieson asked as he walked up.
“They
took him to another hospital. Apparently, he refused to be brought here,”
Jackie spoke.
“Grace,
I need to talk to you.”
“There’s
nothing to talk about, Jamieson.”
“You’ve
been ignoring my text messages and I want to know why.”
“What
text messages? I never got any from you. Oh shit. I changed my number.
Remember, you told me to?”
“And
you couldn’t give me your new number why?” He glared at me.
“I
haven’t seen you.”
His
eye steadily narrowed at me.
“You
have my number in your phone. You didn’t get a new phone, Grace,” he spoke.
“Actually,
I did get a new phone.” I pulled it from my pocket and held it up to him. “Some
of my contacts didn’t transfer over, and you were one of them.”
“Well,
you see me now. Can I please have it?”
“No.”
I scrunched up my nose. “I really don’t see any reason for you to.”
“Are
you fucking serious?” he asked in a harsh tone.
“Yeah.
Pretty much. I’m not sleeping with you again, and I’m not sure we’re really
friends anymore.”
“Why?
All because of Rebecca? Are you kidding me?”
He
grabbed my arm and led me into the doctors’ lounge.
“Will
you let go of me?” I spewed.
“You
lied to me,” he harshly spoke.
“Lied
about what?”
“You’re
starting to have feelings for me.”
I let
out a loud laugh.
“Yeah,
right. I am not nor, do I have feelings for you.”
“Yes
you do!”
“No I
don’t!”
“You’re
all pissed off about Rebecca. In fact, you’re jealous.” He pointed his finger
at me. “Me and you, we aren’t a couple or anything. So you have no right to be
upset.”
“I’m
not upset. I’m just not going to be another one of your whores!” I pressed my
finger into his chest.
“If
you recall, you called me that night to come to your place because you were
horny! I didn’t initiate it. You did! You specifically told me that you weren’t
looking for anything. But clearly, you’ve had a change of heart and you’ve changed
your mind. I was stupid enough to think that you were different.”
Anger
rose up inside me as I began to lash out at him.
“You
think after everything I went through in New York that I’d be racing to get
involved with someone!” I spoke through gritted teeth.
“How
the hell do I know? I don’t even know what the fuck happened in New York. You
won’t tell me!” He held out his arms to the side. “What did he do? Cheat on
you? Did you catch him with another woman?”
“We’re
done here,” I calmly spoke as I grabbed my purse and walked out of the lounge.







Chapter Nineteen

Jamieson
“Damn
it.” I kicked the chair and went up to my office.
“I
have time to finish what we started.” Rebecca smiled as she walked into my
office. “That’s if you’re available.”
“No.
Actually I’m not available and I won’t be anymore. I want you to finish post-op
rounds. I’m leaving. Page me if anything comes up.”
I
grabbed my briefcase and started walking towards the door.
“What’s
the problem, Jamieson?” she asked with an attitude.
“It’s
Dr. Finn, Dr. Lasher. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
I
walked to my car, climbed in, and drove home. When I arrived, I poured myself a
scotch and took it up to the rooftop, where I stood against the railing and
looked out into the ocean. I did nothing wrong. Fuck it. I didn’t need this
shit and I certainly didn’t need Grace.
The
next morning, Renata called me into her office.
“You
paged me?” I asked as I stepped inside.
She
sat behind her desk with a scowl across her face.
“Dr. Lasher
came to me this morning and requested to be off your service. She said that she
decided neuro wasn’t the path she wanted to go, but I don’t believe her. What
the hell did you do?”
I
sighed as I took a seat across from her desk.
“I
didn’t do anything. If she wants off my service, fine. Put her somewhere else.
I’m not going to force someone to stay if they don’t want to.”
“Dr.
Finn?” Her brow raised.
“I
rejected her advances. Okay?”
“And
why the hell would you do that? Are you feeling okay?”
I took
in a sharp breath.
“Renata,
just put her somewhere else if that’s what she wants,” I sternly spoke.
“What’s
going on with you, Jamieson?”
“Nothing.
I’m just getting really tired of these women.”
“Damn.
I never thought I’d hear you say those words.” She smirked. “Effective
immediately, Dr. Jonathan Becker will be your new resident.”
“Good.
He’s a good doctor. Is that all, Renata? I have rounds.”
“That’s
all, Jamieson.” Her eye narrowed at me.
I got
up from the chair and walked out of her office. I pushed the button for the
elevator and when the doors opened, I saw Grace standing there.
“Dr.
Harper.” I nodded.
“Dr.
Finn.”
We
were both heading up to the rooftop for morning coffee. Once the elevator
reached the top, the doors opened, and I motioned for her to go ahead of me.
Neither one of us spoke a word until we were both paged down to the ER.
“Pile
up on the highway,” she spoke.
“We
better get down there.”
We
took the elevator down to the ER, and when we stepped out, we waited outside
for the ambulances to pull up.
“What
do we have?” Grace asked the paramedic.
“Thirty-six-year-old
male. Driver of the car that flipped on the highway. Chest and abdominal
injuries. Hypotensive en route. BP 80/50. Pulse is in the sixties.”
“Name?”
she asked.”
“Carl
McAllister.”
“Let’s
get him to trauma room three,” Grace spoke.
The
second ambulance pulled up and I ran over to it.
“What
do we have?” I asked as the paramedic opened the door.
“Thirty-six-year-old
female. Passenger of flipped car. She was found lying outside the car. Multiple
head and chest trauma. She was unresponsive in the field.”
“Get
her into trauma room four. Type and cross six units and hang two units of O
neg. She’s bleeding out.”
“Dr.
Finn, her heartrate is tachycardic in the 130s,” Sara spoke.
I
placed the stethoscope on her chest.
“No
breath sounds on the right. Set up a chest tube now. She could have an aortic
transection. Page cardio stat!”
“She’s
going into AFIB,” Sara spoke.
“Get
me the paddles and charge to 200,” I yelled. “Push one of epi. Clear.” I
shocked her. “Charge to 250. Clear. Push another round of epi and charge to
300. Clear.” I shocked her again. We all stared at the monitor and nothing. She
was gone and there was nothing left I could do.
“Time
of death, ten fifteen.” I looked at the clock.
I
slowly shook my head as I removed my gloves and went to see if Grace needed
help.
****
Grace
“We
have to stop this bleeding. Call the OR and tell them we’re on our way.”
“We
lost his wife,” Jamieson spoke as he stepped into the room.
“His
pressure is bottoming out, Dr. Harper,” Jackie spoke. “We’re losing him.”
“Start
chest compressions,” I spoke. “Push one of epi and charge the paddles to 200.”
Jackie
handed me the paddles while another nurse started compressions.
“Clear.”
I shocked him. “Push another round of epi and charge to 300. Clear!”
Nothing.
“Charge
to 300 again. Clear!” I shocked him again. “Come on.”
“Please
don’t let my daddy die,” I heard a soft voice from the doorway.
Holding
the paddles in my hand, I looked over and saw a little girl who was about ten
years old standing there with tears in her eyes.
“Please
save him,” she softly spoke. “Please.”
I froze
as I stared into her eyes and swallowed hard. I felt paralyzed as my mind took
me back to when I was ten years old.
“Dr.
Harper?” Jackie spoke. “Dr. Harper!” she shouted.
I
snapped back into reality and looked at Jackie.
“Get
her out of here and push another round of epi,” I spoke.
I
started chest compressions and carefully watched the monitor.
“Again,”
I shouted.
“Grace,
it’s been twenty minutes,” Jamieson spoke as he walked over to me.
“Another!”
I shouted to the nurse as I continued chest compressions.
I
stared at the monitor waiting for that rhythm to appear.
“Grace,”
Jamieson spoke as he lightly placed his hand on my arm. “He’s gone.”
I
turned as my teary eyes stared into his.
“Push
3 mgs of Atropine, Jackie!”
“Dr.
Harper,” she spoke with a concerned look on her face.
“NOW!”
I shouted as I continued chest compressions.
Staring
at the monitor, he was still flatlined. All I kept seeing in my mind was that
little girl who had already lost her mother.
“You
are not going to die and leave your little girl alone!” I shouted as I took my
fist and punched his heart as hard as I could.
Suddenly,
the soft beeps of the machine changed their tone.
“We
got a rhythm,” Jackie spoke.
I let
out a deep breath.
“Let’s
get him to the OR now.” 
****
Jamieson
I
stood there as they wheeled the patient out of the room. Grace was determined
to bring him back and she did. I couldn’t believe what I witnessed with her.
The only problem with the whole situation was his neurological outcome. When
she looked at that little girl, all I saw was fear in her eyes. She wanted to
save him for her, but at what cost? What good would it do that little girl if
her father was in a coma for the rest of his life?







Chapter Twenty

Grace
“Take
him to the CCU and start the hypothermia protocol,” I spoke before leaving the
operating room. 
I let
out a deep long breath, took off my scrub cap and my gown, and scrubbed out. When
I was finished, I went up to Renata’s office.
“You
paged me?” I asked.
“I
did. I wanted to let you know that the little girl’s grandparents are on their
way to the hospital. They’ll be here in about four hours. Meanwhile, a social worker
is with her now.”
“Good.”
I slowly nodded my head.
“Grace,
what you did for that man was wonderful, but you do realize that he may never
fully recover?”
“He’ll
recover, Renata. He has to. He has a daughter he needs to take care of.”
“Do
you think that maybe you got a little too personal in that room?”
“What?”
I cocked my head. “I’m a doctor and my job is to save lives.”
“I
know that. All I’m saying is that little girl could still possibly lose her
father. I don’t want to give her false hope. It could be more damaging. That
man may never wake up.”
My
pager went off and when I checked it, Jamieson had paged me, asking me to come
to the CT room.
“I have
to go. I’m needed in the CT room.”
“Grace?”
“Yeah.”
I turned around before walking out the door.
“I’m
here if you need to talk.”
“Thanks,
Renata. Also, you can tell my Aunt Cora that I’m fine.” I lightly smiled.
I
walked to the CT room, and when I arrived, Jamieson was sitting in the chair
staring at the monitors.
“You
paged me?”
“How’s
your patient?” he asked.
“He’s
stable. We’ll have to wait and see when he wakes up.”
“If he
wakes up,” Jamieson spoke. “What happened in that room?”
“What
do you mean?”
“Something
happened to you in there.”
“Nothing
happened to me. I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“So
you’re sticking to that story, eh?” His eye narrowed at me.
“Yeah.
That’s my story. Now why did you page me?”
“No
reason. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to tell a patient that she’s dying of
brain cancer.” He got up from his chair and walked out.
Rolling
my eyes, I went to check on my patient and found his little girl with the
social worker sitting by her father’s side.”
“Hi
there,” I spoke as I walked into the room. “Can you give us a moment?” I asked
the social worker.
“Sure.
I’ll just be outside.”
“What’s
your name?” I asked her with a smile.
“Sydney.”
“It’s
nice to meet you, Sydney. I’m Dr. Harper, but you can call me Grace. I heard
your grandparents are on their way.”
“Yeah.”
She looked down. “Is my dad going to be okay?”
I took
in a deep breath.
“I
hope so. Right now, he’s stable and we’re keeping a very close eye on him.”
“Is he
going to have brain damage? I overheard one of the nurses talking.”
“There
is a possibility. We’ll have to see when he wakes up.”
“When
will he wake up?”
“I don’t
know, sweetie.”
She
began to cry as she laid her head on her father’s arm. I gently placed my hand
on her back and slowly began to rub it.
“I
know this is hard. When I was about your age, I lost both my parents in a car
accident.”
She
lifted her head and looked at me with her teary eyes.
“You
did?”
“Yeah.
I did.”
“I
don’t want my dad to die.”
“I
know, and we’re doing everything we can to help him. I want you to do me a
favor. Talk to your dad.”
“Can
he hear me?”
“Some
will tell you he can’t, but I know he can.” I lightly smiled.
My pager
went off and when I checked it, I was needed down in the ER.
“I
have to go. I’ll come back later to check up on you.”
“Thank
you, Grace. Thank you for not giving up on my dad.”
“You’re
welcome, Sydney.”
I went
down to the ER and Jackie told me there was a trauma coming in about two
minutes. When I walked outside to wait for the ambulance, Dr. Rebecca Lasher
was standing there.
“Aren’t
you supposed to be up in neuro?” I asked.
“I’m
on your service now.”
“Why?”
“Neuro
wasn’t for me. I’m sorry about yesterday. I swear it won’t happen again.”
“It
better not.”
The
ambulance pulled up and the paramedic opened the door.
“Twenty-nine-year-old
female involved in an MVA. Thirty-seven weeks pregnant with abdominal bruising
and pain.”
“Hi,
I’m Dr. Harper. Can you tell me your name?” I asked as we wheeled her into
trauma room five.
“Cassie.
My baby. Is my baby okay?”
“We’re
going to find out. I just need you to stay calm. Ultrasound,” I spoke to Dr.
Lasher.
She
handed me the transducer and I placed it on Cassie’s belly.
“Dr.
Harper, she’s bleeding,” Dr. Lasher spoke as she lifted the sheet from her.
“Baby’s
BP is dropping,” Jackie spoke.
“Damn
it. The umbilical cord is prolapsed. We need to get this baby out now. Page OB
and have them meet us in the OR. Tell them we’re on our way.”
After
my surgery, I went to the cafeteria and grabbed a salad for lunch. Instead of
eating it there, I took it up to the rooftop and sat down at a small round
table.
“May I
join you?” Jamieson asked as he stood there with his tray.
“I
guess.” I glared at him. “What the hell happened between you and Rebecca? Yesterday,
you were getting in her pants and today she’s on my service.” I arched my brow.
“You
can have her. Anyway, I want everything cleared up with us before we leave for
Vegas in a couple of days.”
“Everything
is cleared up, Jamieson. We’re colleagues. Nothing more, and that’s the way
it’s going to stay. We’re friends. Not friends with benefits. Just friends. There
won’t be any more sex. I never should have broken my rule. From now on, I’m
sticking with BOB.”
“Bob?”
His brow raised.
“My
boyfriend on batteries.”
The
corners of his mouth curved up into a sly smile.
“That’s
really hot. You just made my cock twitch.”
I took
the fork that I was holding and lightly stabbed his hand, which was resting on
the table.
“Ouch.
What was that for?”
“That
was for being a pig.”
My
pager went off and CCU paged me 911.
“It’s Mr.
McAllister 911.”
I
quickly got up from the table and pushed the button to the elevator. Jamieson
followed me inside. As soon as the doors opened, I ran down the hall and into
the room, where I found Mr. McAllister awake.
“Welcome
back, Mr. McAllister.” I smiled as I walked over to him and checked his vitals.
“Do you know where you are?”
“Hospital,”
he sleepily spoke.
 “Do you remember what happened?”
“Car
accident. Where’s my wife and daughter?”
I
swallowed hard and glanced over at Jamieson.
“I’m
so sorry, Mr. McAllister, we did everything we could for your wife. Her
injuries were just too bad.”
Tears
filled Mr. McAllister’s eyes as he started to shake.
“My
daughter?”
“She’s
fine. I’ll go get her.” I placed my hand on his.
After
bringing Sydney to her father, Jamieson and I walked out of the room.
“Thanks
for telling him about his wife.”
“She
was my patient,” he spoke.
“He
woke up.” I smiled. “And he’s talking.”
“Yeah,
he did.” Jamieson placed his hand on my shoulder before walking away.







Chapter Twenty-One

Jamieson
Grace
still hadn’t given me her phone number and we were leaving tomorrow morning for
Vegas. I pulled out my pager, paged her with my number and a 911. Within
seconds, my phone rang, and I had her number.
“I’ll
pick you up tomorrow morning, outside your building at nine a.m. Be ready.”
“Jamieson?”
“Yes?
Who else would be picking you up?”
“Clever,”
she spoke.
“Of
course I am. See you in the morning.”
I
ended the call and met Logan at the bar for dinner and a couple of drinks.
The
next morning, my alarm went off, and when I opened my eyes, I looked down at
the arm that was wrapped around me. Shit. I thought she left last night. I shut
the alarm off and climbed out of bed.
“Time
to get up.” I picked up her clothes off the floor and threw them on the bed.
“Oh God.
No. Just a little while longer,” she moaned.
“No
can do, sweetheart. I need to get ready to leave for the airport and I need you
out of here.”
“Call
me when you get back?” she asked.
“Sure.”
I
wasn’t calling her. Hell, I didn’t even remember her name. She was just a girl
I met at the bar. Just another foolish mistake on my part. If I remembered
correctly, she wasn’t even that good. Not like....
“I’m
getting in the shower. You can let yourself out.”
“No
goodbye kiss?” She pouted.
“I
don’t do goodbye kisses. Have a good day.”
When I
stepped out of the shower, I looked around to make sure bar girl was gone.
Sitting on my nightstand was a small white piece of paper with her phone number
on it. I picked it up, crumbled it in my hand, and threw it in the trash.
Grabbing my bag from the chair that sat in the corner next to my window, I
headed out the door to pick up Grace.
When I
pulled up to her building, she was standing by the curb holding the handle of
her large suitcase. I climbed out of the car and took it from her.
“For God
sakes, we’ll only be gone for three days. What the hell did you pack?”
“I
need options. Not to mention my makeup, hair products, and styling tools.” She
smiled.
I
shook my head as I threw her suitcase in the trunk. It barely fit.
“You’re
lucky I didn’t bring a suitcase. Yours barely fits,” I spoke.
“Then
maybe you need a bigger car.” A smirk crossed her face.
I
sighed as I put the car in drive and headed to the airport.
“Rough
night?” she asked.
“Why
do you say that?” I asked as I glanced over at her.
“Because
you look a little tired. Were you at the hospital?”
“No.
Logan and I went to the bar for a couple of drinks. I got home pretty late.”
“I
hope she was worth it,” she spoke.
“What?”
“I
hope the girl you brought home was worth the late night.”
I
didn’t say a word as I kept driving down the highway. I didn’t need to. My
silence said it all.
We
boarded the plane and took our seats in business class.
“May I
get you anything to drink?” the flight attendant asked.
“I’ll
have a scotch on the rocks,” I spoke.
“I’m
sorry, but we’re out of scotch today.”
I
sighed. “Fine, just get me a gin and tonic.”
“And
for you?” She smiled at Grace.
“I’ll
just have some coffee. Drinking already?” Her brow raised.
“It
helps to relax me. I’m not a huge fan of flying.”
“I
never understood why people feel that way. Cars are way more dangerous,” she
spoke as she stared out the window.
She
started to rattle off statistics from an article that was published back in the
early nineties. I stared at her as if she was reading it at that moment.
“What?”
she asked.
“Nothing.
I forgot you had a photographic memory.”
The
flight went by quickly, and when we landed in Vegas, I turned on my phone to
find a text message from Renata.
“Dr. Finn, remember what we
discussed about Dr. Harper. I expect you to be on your best behavior where
she’s concerned.”
I
rolled my eyes and shoved my phone in my pocket. As we were walking out of the
airport, we saw a man dressed in a black suit holding up a sign with Grace’s
name on it.
“What
the—”
“I’m
Dr. Grace Harper,” she spoke as we approached the gentleman.
“Mr.
Conway has sent a car for you to take you to the Venetian Hotel.”
“Awesome.”
She smiled as she looked at me.
“You
know Robert Conway?” I asked her as we climbed into the limo.
“I do.
He’s a family friend. I’ve known him since I was a child. He was friends of my
parents and my Aunt Cora.”
“Seriously?
May I ask what your parents did for a living?”
“My
parents were both epidemiologists.”
“Really?
Then I’m sure growing up with two parents in the medical field, a doctor was
something you always wanted to be.”
“No.”
She laughed. “First, I wanted to be a lawyer. Up until I was ten years old, I’d
spend my time reading law books. I’d studied cases and at dinner, I’d tell my
parents about what I learned. Then after my parents died, all that changed.”
“Why?”
I asked.
“Because
a trauma surgeon was what I was meant to be.”
The
limo pulled up to the curb of the Venetian Hotel. We climbed out of the car,
walked inside, and up to the front desk.
“How
may I help you?” a nice gentleman asked with a bright smile.
“We’re
here for the medical conference,” I spoke. “The name is Dr. Jamieson Finn and
Dr. Grace Harper. There should be two rooms.”
“Ah
yes. Welcome to the Venetian. Dr. Finn, your room number is 2817, and Dr.
Harper, you will be in our Prima luxury suite on the thirtieth floor, room
3025.”
He
handed us our keycards and we walked over to the elevator.
“Seriously?”
I arched my brow at her. “The prima suite?”
“One of
the perks of knowing the director.” She grinned.
“I
know the director,” I spoke.
“You’re
not special.” A smirk crossed her face.
“You’re
funny.” I cocked my head.
The
elevator door opened on the twenty-eighth floor.
“This
is my floor. How about grabbing some lunch after we get settled? Let’s say
about thirty minutes?”
“Sure.”
“I’ll
come pick you up. I want to see this fancy suite you’re in.” I smirked just before
the elevator doors shut.







Chapter Twenty-Two

Grace
I
stepped into my suite and looked around at the beauty and elegance of it all.
The marble floors were to die for as well as the impeccable décor that graced
the rooms. The master bedroom had an enormous king-size bed with a private bath
and a sunken jetted tub, a fully stocked wet bar, separate living area, and the
best view of the Strip. I smiled as I took it all in. Taking my phone from my
purse, I Facetimed my Aunt Cora.
“Hello,
my darling.” She smiled.
“Hi.
Look at this suite that Robert put me up in,” I spoke as I turned the phone and
gave her a quick tour.
“Lovely.
I’m jealous that I can’t be there with you. How was your flight?”
“It
was good. Jamieson and I are going to grab some lunch in a bit.”
“I
thought you said you were done with him?” Her eye narrowed at me.
“I am.
I’m not sleeping with him again. But we work together and we’re on this trip
together, so we need to keep things friendly.”
“And
he knows you’re not sleeping with him anymore?”
“Oh
yeah. I made it very clear. You were right. I was using sex to escape from Sam
and the memories of being back in Los Angeles.”
“You
seemed pretty upset that night when you called me and told me about him and
that resident.”
“I
wasn’t upset about that. I was more upset at myself for allowing myself to be
so vulnerable.”
“Mhm.”
Her brow arched.
I rolled
my eyes and let out a sigh as I sat down on the couch.
“It’s
the truth, Aunt Cora. Dr. Jamieson Finn is a very toxic man and I don’t need
that kind of toxicity in my life. Not now, not ever. I’m just focusing on my
career and being the best trauma surgeon I can be. Until I heal from what
happened with Sam, there isn’t any room in my life for a man. In fact, I don’t
think I’ll ever have room again.”
“That’s
not true, darling. When the time is right, the love of your life will sweep you
off your feet and you’ll never look back.”
“I
thought I’d found the love of my life.”
“Do
you really believe that?”
Suddenly,
there was a knock at the door. I got up from the couch and opened it.
“I
have to go, Aunt Cora, Jamieson is here.”
“Don’t
be rude, Grace. Let me say hi.”
I
turned the phone around and held it up to Jamieson as he walked into the suite.
“Cora?”
he asked with a shocked look on his face.
“Hello,
Dr. Finn.”
“Umm.
How are you?”
“I’m
good, dear. Enjoy the medical conference.”
“Thank
you,” he spoke.
I
turned the phone around and found my Aunt Cora sitting there with her left brow
raised.
“Goodbye,
Aunt Cora.”
I
ended the call and sighed.
“Dr.
Cora Wyndham is your aunt?” he asked.
“Yep.”
I smiled. “She sure is.”
He
stood there as his eye steadily narrowed at me.
“What?”
I asked.
“You
didn’t feel the need to tell me that?”
“To be
honest, I didn’t think about it. Why? Do you know her?” I asked, knowing full
well that he did.
“Yes,
of course I know her. We’ve worked together at Mount-Sinai. She’s a great woman
and an excellent psychiatrist. She never mentioned you.”
“She’s
a private person. Did you ever talk about personal things with her?”
“No.”
“That’s
why. Let’s go eat. I’m starving.”
We
took the elevator down to the lobby and when the doors opened and we stepped
out, Robert Conway was standing in the lobby.
“There
she is.” He smiled as he held out his arms.
“Hello,
Robert.” I smiled as he kissed my cheek.
“It’s
good to see you, baby girl. It’s been far too long. “Dr. Jamieson Finn. It’s
good to see you again,” he spoke as he extended his hand.
“Good
to see you too, Robert.”
“Look
at you.” He placed his hands on my shoulder. “You are more gorgeous than the
last time I saw you. Isn’t she gorgeous, Jamieson?”
“Yes.
She is.”
“I was
surprised when Cora told me you left Manhattan Memorial, Grace. And I was even
more surprised when she told me you were working at Cedars-Sinai. Everything
okay? I know it can’t be easy moving back to Los Angeles.”
“I’m
fine, Robert. Everything is great.” I grinned.
“Good.
Cedars-Sinai is very lucky to have such talent, besides Dr. Finn, of course.”
He
looked at his watch and then kissed my cheek.
“I
have to run. We’ll catch up later. It was good to see you both.” He pointed to
us as he walked away.
“Shall
we?” Jamieson gestured with his hand towards Eddie V’s restaurant.
As
soon as we sat down, Jamieson ordered a scotch and I ordered a glass of wine.
It felt good to be able to drink without any worry of being called into the
hospital for an emergency.
“Here’s
to a weekend filled with alcohol.” He grinned as he held up his glass.
“For
sure!” I smiled as I lightly tapped mine against his.
We
were eating and making small talk about surgeries. The women who passed by our
table gawked at the hotness sitting across from me and the small flirty smiles
he gave back. It was irritating to say the least.
“It
must be hard to be you,” I spoke.
“What
must be hard?” He chuckled.
“Always
being stared at by women.”
“It
has its perks.” A smirk crossed his perfectly shaped lips.
“There’s
a rumor going around that Logan is the father of Riley’s baby.”
“It’s
no rumor.” He sighed. 
All of
a sudden, Jamieson’s face turned pale as he stared at the man and woman who were
approaching our table.
“Hello,
son.”
“Dad.
Tracy. I didn’t know you were speaking at this conference.”
“Hello,
Jamieson.” Tracy smiled.
“Nor
did I know that you were. And you are?” His eyes turned to me.
I
politely smiled as I extended my hand. “I’m Doctor Grace Harper, trauma surgeon
at Cedars-Sinai.”
“Grace,
this is my father, Doctor Carlyle Finn, and his wife, Tracy.”
“Trauma
surgeon. I’m impressed. Nice to meet you, Dr. Grace Harper.”
“Jamieson,
we missed you at your father’s birthday party,” Tracy spoke.
“Sorry
about that. I was tied up in surgery,” he spoke deadpan.
The
tension in the air was so thick, you couldn’t cut it with a sword. I got the feeling
there was no love lost between either one of them.
“We
better get to our table. It was nice to meet you, Grace.”
“It
was nice to meet you as well, Dr. Finn.”
He
looked at Jamieson, who was staring off to the side.
“How
long are you staying in Vegas?” he asked his father.
“We’re
heading back tomorrow after the conference. We’re leaving Saturday morning for
a cruise. That’s something you can do when you own your own practice.”
Jamieson
took in a sharp breath.
“Anyway,
enjoy the rest of your lunch,” Carlyle spoke as he walked away.
Jamieson
rolled his eyes as he picked up his scotch and threw it down the back of his
throat.
“I had
no idea you also came from a family of doctors,” I spoke. “What type is he?”
“He’s
a urologist and has his own practice in Beverly Hills. To him, it’s not about
the medicine, it’s about the money. It always has been.”
“It
doesn’t seem like the two of you are very close.”
“We
aren’t. I resent him for a lot of things, and he resents me for becoming a
neurosurgeon and crushing his dream of having a father and son practice.”
“Oh.”
I picked up my glass of wine. “And the reason you—”
“This
conversation is over. Understand?” he spoke in a harsh tone.
“Loud
and clear.” I finished off my wine.
“Do
you gamble?” he asked.
“A
little.” I smirked.
“Let’s
go to the casino.”
After
Jamieson paid the bill, we headed to the casino and sat down at a blackjack
table.
“I’m
not really sure how to play. Could you explain it to me, please?” I asked the
dealer.
“Sure,
doll. I’d be happy to.” He smiled.
The
dealer gave an explanation while Jamieson stared at me with a steady gaze.
“Understand?”
“Yeah.
I think so. Thank you.”
The
table was full, and the cards were dealt. I watched carefully and made sure I
lost the first five hands.
“You
totally could have won that hand,” Jamieson spoke.
“Really?”
I glanced over at him. “I guess I’m still trying to figure this game out.”
His
eye narrowed at me.
I
placed my bet, and the cards were dealt. The dealer lost, and I won.
“OMG!”
I spoke with excitement. “I won!”
Placing
another bet, I doubled it, and I won again. I let myself win three hands in a
row, pulled back on my bet, and made sure to lose the next four. I was up over
two thousand dollars, and when the last hand was dealt, I made sure to lose.
“That’s
it for me,” Jamieson spoke.
“I
guess I better quit while I’m ahead.” I smiled.
We got
up from our seats and Jamieson lightly placed his hand on my elbow. Leaning
closer to me, he whispered in my ear.
“You
knew how to play. You were counting the cards.”
I
raised my brow with a smile as we kept walking.
“Do
you know how much money you could have won?” he asked.
“Did
you want to get kicked out of here?”
“Good
point.”







Chapter Twenty-Three

Jamieson
I
should have known that my father was going to be here. Anger rose inside me
every time I thought about him. The only thing that was keeping me sane was
being with Grace and the thought of fucking her back in my hotel room.
We
stepped into the elevator and I placed my hand on her cheek.
“Let’s
go back to my room.”
“I
can’t, Jamieson.”
“Sure
you can. I know you want to.” I smiled.
I
leaned in and softly brushed my lips against hers. I needed her tonight.
“I
can’t.” She placed her hand on my chest.
“Whatever,
Grace.” I shook my head. “I don’t know what the fuck your problem is. You’re
acting like a goddamn child. You know what? From now on, we’re just co-workers.
That’s it.”
The
elevator reached my floor, and as soon as the doors opened, I stepped out with
my hands tucked tightly in my pockets and she followed me.
“Because
I won’t have sex with you, we’re not friends? Are you serious right now? What
kind of man are you?”
I
scanned the room key and opened the door.
“A man
who has needs.” I threw the keycard on the table. “And if you don’t want to
fulfill those needs, then I’ll find someone who will. But if you want the
truth, I’d rather fuck you.”
“Oh my
God, you are so crass. I can’t even believe I slept with you in the first
place.”
“Well,
you did, and I know you enjoyed it just as much as I did! So honestly, I don’t
understand what the fuck the problem is here, Grace. We’re two adults not
looking for anything but sex. Unless you’re looking for more. Even though you
say you aren’t, I think you are and that’s why you got so mad when you saw me
and Rebecca.”
“You
don’t know shit!” She pointed at me.
“That’s
the problem with you women. You always want more. You just can’t be satisfied
with the sex like men can. This is the exact reason why I don’t get involved in
relationships. Too many complications and too many expectations.”
“You
have no clue how he hurt me, and that’s not just something I can forget so
easily.”
“Come
on, Grace. He hurt your ego. That’s all. He cheated on you with another woman.
The guy is an asshole for doing that to you. The least he could have done was
break it off with you. I don’t understand that whole thing. If someone is
unhappy in the relationship, break it off first.”
“So you’re
saying that if you were in a relationship and unhappy, you’d break up with the
person first instead of cheating on her?”
“Yeah.
I would. But, see, I don’t put myself in that kind of position.”
“What
happened to you as a child for you to be so anti-relationship?”
I
stared at her for a moment. Maybe if I’d told her, she’d feel sorry for me and
then we’d have sex. Something I desperately needed right now. But I couldn’t. I
didn’t talk about it. I never talked about it.
“Nothing.
It’s just the way I am. Now, if we’re not going to fuck, then you can leave my
room.”
Her
angry eyes stared into mine and I thought she was going to explode. She grabbed
her purse and began walking towards the door. Placing her hand on the handle,
she slowly turned her head and looked at me.
“He
didn’t cheat on me. I was the other woman for over a year. He was married and I
never knew. He was that good of a liar and lived a double life. He broke me,
and I need to put myself back together before even thinking about being
involved with another man. Even if it’s just sex.”
She
turned the handle, opened the door, and walked out. I stood there in shock and
the thought of running after her crossed my mind. But I didn’t. She needed
space and so did I. The one woman I wanted more than anything rejected me and
that was something I wasn’t used to.
****
Grace
Rage
consumed me. How dare he. I entered my suite, threw myself on the bed, placed a
pillow over my face, and screamed as loud as I could into it as tears fell from
my eyes.
The
next morning, as I was getting ready for the medical conference, there was a
knock on the door. Opening it, I saw Jamieson standing there.
“Truce?”
He raised his hand.
“Whatever.”
I rolled my eyes and walked back into the bedroom.
“Grace,
I’m going to do something I don’t ever do.”
“And
what’s that?” I turned and glared at him.
“I’m
going to apologize for last night. I had no idea that the douchebag was
married. I can’t even imagine what you felt when you found out.”
I
stared at him as I stood in my white robe, compliments of the hotel. Today was
a day I always wanted to forget, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t.
For twenty years, I tried to put this day behind me, but it always hurt so
much. 
He
looked so sexy in his black dress pants and light gray dress shirt with his
striped tie. Just one more time. I needed it to try to forget this day. I felt
like nothing more than a drug addict and Jamieson Finn was my drug.
I
slowly walked over to where he was standing and stared into his beautiful blue
eyes. My fingers untied my robe and I slowly slid it off my shoulders,
revealing my naked body underneath. Jamieson took in a sharp breath as his eyes
raked over me.
“Grace,”
he whispered as he brought his hand to my cheek.
I
reached up and brushed my lips against his. Instantly, they locked, and our
tongues found their way to each other. If I could forget, for only just a few
minutes, it would be totally worth it. His hands grasped my breasts as his
fingers stimulated my nipples, sending vibrations down below and a pool of
wetness to emerge from me. I reached for his belt, and within a split second,
it was undone and his pants were sliding off his hips. His mouth left mine and
grazed my neck. He placed one arm around my waist and led me over to the bed,
where I lay on my back as he unbuttoned his shirt and slid it off his
shoulders.
He
lightly grabbed my legs and pulled me to the edge of the bed, where he got down
on his knees and slid his tongue up my inner thigh. I moaned in delight as my
body trembled, for it knew what was to come next. His mouth lightly caressed my
most sensitive area, while his finger dipped inside me. A moan erupted from me
as I turned my head and my eyes caught sight of the time.
“Shit.
We better hurry up. We’re going to be late.”
He
stood up, took the condom out of his wallet, and slipped it on. Hovering over
me, he pushed himself inside, inch by inch, until he was buried in me. Moans
escaped us at the same time as he thrust in and out, pleasuring my body to the
fullest. My hands tangled through his hair as our lips met with a passionate
kiss. Before long, an orgasm tore through me like a tornado hit a town. I let
out a pleasing moan as he halted and exploded inside me. His body collapsed on
mine for a moment as we tried to slow our breathing. He lifted his head and
stared at me with a smile.
“This
is the last time, Dr. Finn.”
“If
you say so.” He kissed my lips.
He
climbed off me and went into the bathroom. I quickly put on my black dress and
heels and ran a brush through my hair. As soon as he was dressed, I grabbed my
purse and we flew out the door and down to the room where the medical
conference was being held.
I sat
in a chair and watched while Jamieson gave his presentation. I didn’t think to
ask him what he was speaking about because I just assumed it was something to
do with neurosurgery. But it wasn’t. It was about finding the reason and possible
cure for schizophrenia. As I sat there and listened to him, his passion for the
topic spoke volumes. I had seen a side of him I didn’t know existed. Now I had
to question why. His presentation ended, and in a few minutes, it would be my
turn. 
“Great
presentation.” I smiled at him.
“Thanks.
I’m going to go and grab some coffee. Good luck.”
He
could sense my need to question him and he quickly dodged the bullet. I heard
my phone ding with a text message, and when I pulled it from my purse, I found
it was from my Aunt Cora.
“Happy birthday, my love. I know
you hate this day, but please, have some fun. You’re in Vegas, after all. I
love you.”
I took
in a deep breath. For a few moments with Jamieson, I’d forgotten what today was,
and after the conference was over, I’d make sure I still forgot.
My
name was called, and I stepped up to the podium.
****
Jamieson
After
watching my presentation, Grace was going to bombard me with a million
questions. But I wasn’t worried. I was prepared to answer them. I sat down in
the back of the room with my coffee in hand and watched her speak. She looked
beautiful and she spoke with such confidence. She was a highly intelligent woman
and she made sure everybody knew it. That was why I was a little confused about
how she didn’t know that douchebag was married. There had to be signs. How does
one hide that for over a year? I wanted to find out more about their
relationship, but I wasn’t sure if she’d be willing to talk about it. There was
something about her that I was drawn to, and I couldn’t get her out of my head
no matter how much I tried. I was up all night thinking about what she told me
and the hurt that resided in her eyes. It was as if I’d felt her pain and it
freaked me the fuck out. I had my own problems and my research to focus on.







Chapter Twenty-Four

Grace
Jamieson
and I stepped onto the elevator and headed back to our rooms to change.
“You
up for getting rip-roaring drunk with me?” I grinned.
“Seriously?
You’re going to get drunk?”
“You
bet I am. You in?”
“Yeah.
I’m in.” He smirked.
“Great.
Give me about twenty-minutes and I’ll meet you at the pool. We can start
there.”
“I’ll
be waiting.”
While
Jamieson and I were at the pool, we got to talking to Mandy and Greg, a couple
who were from Los Angeles. They were both in their mid-twenties. Mandy worked
at an art gallery and Greg worked as a systems tech for a high-end security
company. They were beautiful together and were in Vegas to get married. Their
wedding was already being planned back home by both families and they said it
was getting to be too much, so they decided to take a trip to Vegas and elope.
I thought it was romantic and Jamieson called them straight-up crazy.
“So
what are your families going to say when you tell them you got married?” I
asked Mandy.
“They
won’t be happy, but we don’t care. They’re the reason we’ve decided to do this.
They were making our wedding out to be about them and now both sides are
arguing over the stupidest things. It’s as if our opinion didn’t matter. My
father said as long as he was paying for it, they’d do what they wanted.”
“Sounds
awful,” I spoke.
“So
how long have the two of you been together?” Greg asked Jamieson.
“Oh,
we’re not together.” He laughed. “We work together. We both were speakers at
the medical conference here in the hotel.”
“So
you’re both doctors?” Mandy asked.
“I’m a
trauma surgeon and he’s a neurosurgeon,” I replied.
“Damn,”
Greg spoke.
“We
totally thought the two of you were a couple. You’re so cute together.” Mandy
grinned.
“No.
No couple for us,” Jamieson spoke as he finished off his drink. “Another
round?” he asked.
We
spent the day with them drinking by the pool. Then, we changed our clothes, met
them at the bar, had more drinks and did a few shots, or maybe it was more than
a few. All I knew was that I was wasted out of my mind and that I’d pay for it
tomorrow. But I didn’t care. I was having fun and forgetting about what day it
was. Speaking of being drunk, Jamieson was also wasted out of his mind and the
two of us were having the time of our lives as the night started to become a
big blur.
I
slowly opened my eyes. My head throbbed with pain and my throat was dry. I
could barely move as my stomach churned over and over again. I closed my eyes
again, and when I rolled over, my arm wrapped around bare skin. Shit. Opening one
eye, I saw Jamieson lying there. Looking down at myself, I lifted the sheet and
saw I was naked. Great, we had sex again. The last thing I remembered about
last night was Jamieson and I walking down the strip with drinks in our hand
laughing. I couldn’t deal with today yet, so I went back to sleep.
****
Jamieson
“Fuck,”
I moaned as placed my arm across my forehead.
My
head was pounding, and my eyes were swollen. I hadn’t been this drunk or
hungover in years. I slowly turned my head and saw Grace was still sound
asleep. I wondered if she felt as bad as I did. Considering how much we drank
all day, I wouldn’t be surprised if we had alcohol poisoning. I reached over
and attempted to grab my phone from the nightstand, but it wasn’t there. Slowly
lifting my aching head, I saw it was lying on the floor next to the bed. I
reached down, picked it up, and dialed Stuart Collins.
“Dr.
Collins,” he answered.
“Stuart,
it’s Jamieson. I need you to bring me two banana bags to the Venetian Hotel,
and quickly.”
I
scanned the room and noticed I was in Grace’s suite.
“Room
3025. Stat!”
“Too much
to drink last night?” He lightly laughed.
“You
could say that.”
“I
should be there in about fifteen minutes.”
“Thanks,
Stuart. I owe you one.”
I set
my phone down and slowly closed my eyes.
“Who
were you talking to?” Grace mumbled.
“Stuart
Collins. He’s going to bring us banana bags in about fifteen minutes. You need
one, right?”
“Fuck
yes. I feel like I’m dying,” she softly spoke.
“Yeah,
me too.”
“I
remember nothing about last night. And I’m sorry to say I don’t remember us
having sex,” she whispered.
“I
don’t either. So don’t feel bad.”
“You
used a condom, right?” she grumbled.
“To be
honest, I don’t know.”
She
rolled over onto her back and placed her arm over her head.
“What
time is it?”
I
glanced at the clock on the nightstand.
“Eleven
o’clock.” I reached over and grabbed a white robe that was lying on the floor
and handed it to her. “You better put this on before he gets here.”
“Who
is Stuart Collins and how does he have banana bags?” she asked as she struggled
into her robe.
“He
was one of my residents a couple of years ago. He works at the hospital not too
far from here.”
There
was a knock on the door and I struggled to get out of bed. Pulling on my pants
from yesterday, I slowly stumbled to the door and opened it.
“Damn,
Jamieson, you look like shit.” Stuart smiled.
“Thanks.
Good to see you too. Come on in. Do Grace over there first.”
“Hi,
I’m Doctor Collins. No worries, Grace. I’m going to pump you full of fluids to
help speed up your recovery.”
“I
know what a banana bag is, Dr. Collins. I’m a trauma surgeon.”
“Oh.
Well, it’s nice to meet you.”
As
soon as he was done inserting the IV into Grace, he walked over to my side of
the bed and began mine.
“Did
you two get married or something?” he asked.
“No.
Why the hell would you ask that?”
“Because
you’re both wearing the same gold bands on your left hand.”
Grace
and I both looked at our hands at the same time and then at each other. My
heart started racing and I felt like I was going to vomit. This was nothing but
a joke. A joke we must have played on each other last night.
****
Grace
I
could feel my airways starting to close and I couldn’t breathe. I was going
into a panic attack.
“Grace,
I need you to take deep breaths,” Stuart spoke as he ran over to my side of the
bed. “Look at me.”
I
began to sweat profusely, and I felt like I was going to pass out.
“Slow,
deep breaths,” Stuart spoke. “There you go. Better now?” he asked.
I stared
at him and slowly nodded my head.
“A
drunk marriage. I see it all the time at the hospital. I better get going. I
think the two of you need to talk.”
“Thanks,
Stuart,” Jamieson spoke.
“No
problem. I hope the two of you feel better.”
He
left the room and Jamieson turned to me.
“Grace,
this didn’t happen. It has to be a joke. I bet these aren’t even real.”
“Oh my
God, what did we do?” My eyes widened at him.
“Nothing.
We did nothing!” he loudly voiced. “Goddamn it, why can’t I fucking remember anything?”
“I
need to go back to sleep,” I spoke. “Let’s just go to sleep and we’ll figure
this out when we wake up.”
“Good
idea,” Jamieson spoke. “Because, right now, I can’t deal with this.”






Chapter Twenty-Five

Grace
I
opened my eyes and noticed Jamieson wasn’t in the bedroom. Glancing at the
clock, I saw it was four p.m. I felt a lot better, so I took out my IV, climbed
out of bed, and walked into the living room, where I saw Jamieson sitting on
the couch with his hands covering his face.
“What
are you doing?” I asked.
He
picked up the white piece of paper sitting next to him and handed it to me. It
was our receipt for wedding services rendered with a note that said our proof
of marriage would be ready for pick up today after noon. Placing my hand over
my mouth, I ran to the powder room off the foyer and stuck my head in the
toilet. This wasn’t happening.
Once I
was finished, I wiped my mouth and walked back out to the living room.
“Are
you okay?” Jamieson asked.
“No!
I’m not okay! We fucking got married last night!” I shouted. “Are you okay?”
“Fuck
no! This is bullshit and I know it’s some kind of joke. We both just need to
calm down, get dressed, and head over to this Little Vegas Chapel and find out
what the fuck happened.”
“We
are both wearing gold wedding bands!” I yelled.
I
grabbed the ring and removed it from my finger as quickly as I could. Jamieson
stared at me and then removed his before getting up from the couch.
“Listen,
Grace. Let’s not panic or lose our shit just yet until we find out exactly what
happened last night.”
I took
in a deep breath and went into the bedroom. I ended up losing my shit anyway as
I went into the bathroom and checked the trash can. Then I scurried back into
the bedroom and got down on the floor on my hands and knees, crawling around
the bed like a lunatic.
“What
the hell are you doing?” Jamieson asked.
“Looking
for the condom. The wrapper. Anything!” I shouted. “There’s nothing. No sign of
any condom being used!”
“Grace—”
“Don’t.
Don’t say it!” I pointed at him. “Who knows how many times we had sex last
night. Neither one of us even remembers doing it. In fact, I’m shocked you
could even get it up with as much alcohol as you drank.”
“I can
always get it up, no matter what.”
“Oh, I
bet you can!”
“Are
you on birth control?” he asked in a calm tone.
“Yes.
Of course.”
“Then
what are you worried about?”
“What
am I worried about?” I cocked my head in disbelief as I stood up. “I’m worried
about contracting an STD, you idiot! God knows you’ve slept with half the
hospital and probably all of Los Angeles and New York!” I shouted.
“Okay.
Just stop right there!” he yelled. “I do not have an STD. That I can guarantee.
I’ve never in my life not used a condom with a woman. EVER!”
“Ha. I
find that hard to believe.” I placed my hands on my hips.
He
stood there and slowly shook his head.
“I
don’t care if you believe me or not. I’m one hundred percent clean. Get dressed
so we can go.” He grabbed his clothes and walked out of the bedroom.
I
threw on a sundress and some sandals and we took the elevator to the lobby.
When the doors opened, we saw Mandy and Greg walking out of the hotel.
“Mandy.
Greg. Wait!” I shouted.
“Hey,
you two! What a great day yesterday,” Mandy spoke. “How was Criss Angel?”
“We
don’t remember. In fact, we were hoping you could tell us what we did,”
Jamieson spoke.
“We
don’t know, Jamieson. We parted ways after dinner because we had to be at the
chapel and you guys were going to try and get tickets to see Criss Angel. That
was the last we saw of you,” Greg spoke. “What’s going on?”
“We
just woke up very hungover and can’t remember much about last night,” I spoke.
“Well,
obviously, the three of you had a great time.” Mandy smiled.
“The
three of us?” Jamieson spoke.
“You,
Grace, and the alcohol.” Greg grinned. “Anyway, we have to head to the airport.
Let’s meet up in Los Angeles for dinner one night.”
The
two of them climbed into a cab and Jamieson and I walked down to the Little
Vegas Chapel. When we walked in, we were greeted by an oversized man with a
jolly smile on his face.
“Hello
again. How’s the happy couple? I’m assuming you’re here to pick up your proof
of marriage?”
“We
need to talk to you,” I spoke in a stern voice.
“Sure.
Come with me.” His jolly smile dissipated.
He took
us back into his office and took a seat behind his desk.
“What’s
going on?” he asked.
“That’s
what we need you to tell us,” Jamieson spoke.
“Somehow
I knew this was going to happen.” He sighed. “Let me guess, you have no
recollection of getting hitched last night?”
“No,
we don’t!” Jamieson spoke in a firm voice.
“You
both came in here last night, drunk off your asses. At first, I refused to
marry you. I even told you to come back today if you still wanted to get
married, when you were sober, and I’d marry you. But you insisted. You both
said you were sure you wanted it and you even signed a liability contract
stating that the Little Vegas Chapel would not be held responsible because you
both were intoxicated. It is a legally binding contract. In fact, your wedding
photos are ready.”
He got
up from his chair and walked over to the long table that sat up against the
wall near the door. After picking up a large white envelope, he walked over and
handed it to me. I swallowed hard as I opened it and removed the pictures.
“Oh my
God,” I spoke.
“Fuck
me,” Jamieson said as he rubbed his forehead.
The
pictures were of us posing in the most God awful drunk-off-our-asses poses
there ever could be.
“Where
did I get that veil?”
“You
rented it from us.”
“And
the flowers?”
“From
us.”
“Oh my
God.” I covered my face with my hands.
“What
about the gold bands we were both wearing?” Jamieson asked.
“We
sell rings here as well.”
“So
you’re telling us that this is all real? We came to this place last night and
got married?” Jamieson sighed.
“Yes.
Clearly, the two of you are regretting it now. Good thing I had you sign that
contract.”
“This
is absolutely ridiculous!” Jamieson shouted. “There should be laws about
marrying people who are inebriated.”
“Listen,
you two. You made a mistake. It happens. But there’s nothing to worry about. As
soon as you get home, you go to the courthouse and have the marriage annulled.
It’ll be as if it never happened and the two of you can go your separate ways.
I’m sorry about this, but I tried to discourage you last night, considering the
state you were in.”
“Thank
you,” Jamieson spoke as he got up from his seat. “I apologize if we were any
trouble.”
“Nah.
You two were cute and very persistent. Sometimes the subconscious mind has a
way of telling you things that your conscious mind doesn’t want to know.” He
smiled.
“Trust
us. This is something neither of us wanted,” Jamieson spoke.
We
walked out of the chapel and headed back to the hotel.
“This
is just great. Just fucking great.” He shook his head.
I
didn’t say a word. I just walked alongside him staring straight ahead in
disbelief.
“Aren’t
you going to say anything?”
“What
do you want me say, Jamieson? We got married, woohoo!” I threw my hands up in
the air. “I’m just as sick about it as you are, but we can fix this. You heard
what he said.”
“Damn
right we’re going to fix it. I’m calling my attorney the second we get back to
the hotel.”
We
stepped onto the elevator and Jamieson pushed the button to his floor.
“Come
back to the room with me and I’ll call my attorney. We’ll talk to him and see
how quickly we can get this marriage annulled.”







Chapter Twenty-Six

Jamieson
We
stepped inside my room and I pulled my phone from my pocket.
“Jamieson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?”
“Tony,
I need your help. I’m going to put you on speaker because Dr. Grace Harper is
with me and this involves her as well.”
“Okay.
What’s going on?”
I took
in a long deep breath. To even say the words made me sick to my stomach.
“Grace
and I are in Vegas for a medical conference. We both partied a little too much
yesterday and ended up at a wedding chapel. When we woke up this morning, we
discovered that we involuntarily got married. We need this marriage annulled as
soon as possible.”
“Oh. I
see. So, just to be clear, neither party wanted this marriage?”
“No,”
we both spoke at the same time.
“I’ll
get the paperwork started, but I can’t turn it in until Monday morning. I’ll
put a rush on it and I’ll call you as soon as I hear something.”
“Thanks,
Tony.”
“No
problem, Jamieson. I have to be honest, I’m a little shocked right now. Of all
people calling me with this news.”
“I
know. Just call me Monday with an update.”
“I
will. Don’t worry. We’ll get this taken care of quickly.”
I
ended the call and looked at Grace, who had tears in her eyes.
“Don’t
you dare start crying,” I spoke in a harsh voice. “You don’t get to cry. This
was as much your fault.”
“My
fault? Who paid for the wedding?”
“I
don’t know. Maybe you did,” I shouted. “Neither one of us remembers jack shit
from last night.”
“Well,
if you were any kind of man, you wouldn’t have let me pay for it,” she spoke in
a snooty voice.
“Why
not? Don’t women have equal rights? Why the hell does the man have to pay for
everything?”
“Oh my
God, are you serious right now?”
“Yeah.
I am!” I shouted. “You have no idea how I feel about this. It makes me sick to
my stomach.”
“Oh,
I’m so sorry that being married to me makes you so sick.”
“Grace,
you know what I mean. You feel it too. Don’t deny it. This wasn’t supposed to
be a part of my life. I was never getting married to anyone! I don’t do
marriage and I certainly don’t do family.”
“Yeah,
I know you don’t do family. Anyone could tell there was no love lost between
you and your father. And who knows about your mother because you refuse to talk
about her. So obviously, your relationship is just as bad with her.”
“Shut your
mouth! You don’t ever mention my mother again. Do you understand me?” I
shouted. “You have no idea what the hell you’re talking about.”
“Well,
my parents are dead, and I would give anything to have them back, even if our
relationship wasn’t so great. My life is so fucked. God.” She placed her hands
on her head as she paced around the room. “Of all days. Of all days for this to
happen. If it was any other day, I could forget about it. But not yesterday.
See, the thing is, Jamieson, once this marriage is voided and as if it never
existed, the day will be a distant memory for you. In fact, probably this time
next year, you won’t even remember that it ever happened. But for me, it will
always be in my memory. Every single year for the rest of my life, I will
remember this.”
“Jesus
Christ, Grace, drama queen much? It’s just a goddamn day. You’ll forget all
about it too.”
“No!
No I won’t, because yesterday wasn’t just another goddamn day. UGH!” she
screamed.
“Okay,
you need to calm the fuck down. What is the problem with yesterday besides us
making the stupid mistake we did?”
“Yesterday
was my birthday and the day my parents died. So now, it’s become my birthday,
the day my parents died, and my fucking wedding day to a man I barely know! A
day that is supposed to be special. A fairytale, a goddamn fairytale, and it’s
all your fault!” she shouted.
I stood
there in shock and swallowed hard.
“Don’t
try to pin this on me. For all I know, this is all your fault!” I angrily spoke
then immediately regretted my words. “Grace, listen. I’m sorry. This isn’t one
of our faults. It’s both of ours. We were both highly intoxicated and neither
one of us were of sound mind. So can we at least agree that we are both to
blame?”
She
stood there with her arms folded and her face softened.
“You’re
right. We’re both to blame.”
“Why
didn’t you tell me it was your birthday?” I calmly asked as I took a few steps
towards her.
“Because
I don’t celebrate it and I haven’t since I was ten years old. A birthday is
supposed to be a celebration of your life, but instead, my birthday is the
mourning of my parents’ death. That day, my tenth birthday, started out as a
celebration and ended in tragedy, and that is something I never will forget or
celebrate.”
I
looked away from her because I didn’t know what to say. Any man would have
walked up to her and hugged her tight, but I couldn’t. I had my reasons, and
all of this was too much to bear.
“I
think it’s best if we just go our separate ways now and we agree not to mention
a word of this to anyone. I mean no one. Not even your Aunt Cora. We’ll pretend
it never happened and it’ll be taken care of soon. I also think it’s best if we
stay out of each other’s way from now on. Of course, we’ll run into each other
at the hospital, but we just need to keep it on a professional level. There
will be no more sex or even friendly conversations. I’m not sure we can even be
friends anymore.”
Tears
filled her eyes as she took her finger and gently wiped them away.
“I
never should have moved back to Los Angeles. I have done nothing but make one
stupid decision after another. I never should have broken my rule.” She glared
at me as she walked past me and left my hotel room.
I
sighed as I stared at the door. There was a part of me that felt bad for her.
But this was my life and I needed to take care of me. My focus needed to stay
on my work and my work alone. Grace was just as broken as I was and she had her
issues and I had mine. There was no room in my life or in my head for that. I
knew I was a bastard, but it was the only way I knew how to be.
****
Grace
I went
back to my room as I tried to stop the tears that kept falling down my face. I
grabbed my phone, called the airport, and changed my flight. There was one
leaving in three hours, so I called down to the desk and had them get me a cab.
I threw my things in my suitcase and headed to the airport.
When I
arrived back in Los Angeles, I opened the door to my apartment and dropped on
my couch. My phone rang. It was my Aunt Cora.
“Hello,”
I answered in a somber voice.
“Grace?
What’s wrong?”
“Nothing,
Aunt Cora.” I tried to perk up. “How are you?”
“I’m
fine, darling. How’s Vegas going?”
“Actually,
I just got home.”
“Why?
I thought you weren’t supposed to be home until tomorrow evening?”
“I
came home a day early because I’m not feeling well. I think I might have caught
a bug or something.”
“Grace,
what happened?”
She
always knew when I was lying.
“Nothing.”
I coughed into the phone. “I need to go lie down now. I’m exhausted.”
“Alright.
I hope you feel better soon. Call me later, please.”
“I
will.”
It was
late, like really late, and I wasn’t lying about being exhausted. I took my
suitcase into the bedroom, changed into my pajamas, and went to bed. As I was
lying there, I couldn’t stop thinking about my life, Sam, and Jamieson. My God,
what was wrong with me? 







Chapter Twenty-Seven

Jamieson
I
spent the rest of my night in my room, where I tossed and turned all night
long. The next day, when it was time to head to the airport, I sent a text
message to Grace to see if she was ready to leave.
“Hey, we need to head to the
airport. Are you ready?”
“I flew out last night. I’m already
home.”
I sat
there on the bed staring at her message in disbelief. I couldn’t believe she
flew out early without even telling me.
“You couldn’t shoot me a text
message and tell me that? I was waiting on you.”
“I’m sorry, but why would I? You
made it very clear that we are no longer friends.”
I
sighed as I shook my head and threw my phone down on the bed. That response
didn’t even warrant a reply. Shit. I placed my hands on my head. Fuck it. I
didn’t care. I grabbed my bag and headed to the airport.
It
felt good to be home. As I was standing on the rooftop with a drink in my hand,
staring out into the ocean and listening to the waves crash against the shore,
my doorbell rang. When I looked at the monitor, I saw Logan standing there. I
pushed the intercom button and told him to come in.
“Come
on in. I’m up on the rooftop.”
“What
are you doing up here?” he asked.
“Thinking.
How did you know I was back?”
“I was
driving by and I saw your car in the driveway. How was Vegas?”
“Eventful,”
I spoke as I threw back my drink.
“What’s
going on? You seem like you’re in a bad mood.”
“Damn
it. What I’m about to tell you cannot leave this rooftop. Do you understand
me?”
“Of
course, Jamieson. You know you can trust me. What the hell is going on?”
I
swallowed hard and threw back the rest of my drink before answering him.
“I—I.”
I stopped.
“Jamieson.
What the hell happened? You’re kind of freaking me out right now.”
“I did
something so stupid. So incredibly stupid that I still can’t believe it,” I
spoke in a panicked tone.
“Okay.”
He placed his hand on my shoulder. “Calm down and talk to me.”
“Friday
after the conference, Grace and I drank all day long. We were so wasted, and
when we woke up the next morning, we discovered that we got married.”
“What?”
He started to laugh. “You’re such a jokester. Stop it!”
“I’m
not joking, Logan. It happened and it’s real. Apparently, we got married at the
Little Vegas Chapel.”
His
face turned pale as he removed his hand from my shoulder.
“You’re
not kidding, are you?” The seriousness of his voice frightened me.
“No. I
wish I was.”
“For
fuck sakes, Jamieson. Now what?”
“My
lawyer is preparing the paperwork for an annulment. I told him to put a rush on
it. The faster we get this done, the faster I can put this behind me.”
“What
about Grace? Is she in agreement?”
“Of
course she is. She doesn’t want this either.”
“And
you have no clue how it happened?” he asked.
“No,
and neither does she. Like I said, we were both so intoxicated.”
“Look
on the bright side. This will be over within a matter of days and you can just
go on as if it never happened. At least you didn’t get her pregnant. Alcohol is
the devil, bro. Shit. I can’t believe this.”
“Remember
what I told you. Not a word of this to anyone.”
“Scouts
honor. I swear I won’t tell a soul. But what about Grace? How do you know
she’ll keep her mouth shut?”
“She
will. She doesn’t want anyone knowing about this either.”
“So,
what’s going on with the two of you now?”
“I
told her that our relationship is strictly on a professional level and we won’t
be having sex again. I told her that I didn’t think we could even be friends
anymore.”
“Damn,
Jamieson. It’s almost as if you’re blaming her for this whole thing.”
“I’m
not blaming her. Ever since she got here, things have been off, and I just
think it’s best that we stay out of each other’s life and way.”
“That’s
a little harsh, don’t you think? Grace is a great woman. You both made a
drunken mistake. I don’t think that’s a reason just to cut her out of your
life.” He narrowed his eye at me for a moment. “Unless you’ve developed
feelings for her and you can’t handle it.”
“Don’t
be an idiot. I have no feelings for Grace whatsoever. She’s just like all the rest
of the women I sleep with.”
“Are
you trying to convince me or yourself?”
“I’m
not trying to convince anyone. It’s a straight-up fact. Now, if we’re done
here, I’m heading to the hospital to work on my research.”
“Yeah.
Okay. Call me later and maybe we can grab a couple of drinks. Or not. I would
hate to wake up tomorrow morning and we’re married.” He laughed.
“Get the
hell out of here!”
****
Grace
“Aunt
Cora, what are you doing here?” My eyes widened as I opened the door to my
apartment.
“I
came to see how you were feeling.” Her brow arched at me.
“You
flew all the way from New York just to see how I was feeling? You could have
called.”
“I
know I could have, but I had to see for myself. You can’t hide anything from me,
Grace. You never could. What happened in Las Vegas that you aren’t telling me?”
She demanded to know as she pushed her way past me and into my apartment. “Wow,
this is nice.” She smiled as she looked around.
“Can I
make you some tea?” I asked as I walked into the kitchen.
“Only
if you’re having some. I was up all night worried about you.”
“Well,
that was dumb. You shouldn’t be worried about me. I’m fine,” I spoke as I
filled the tea kettle with water.
“I
can’t help it, darling. You’re my daughter.” She smiled. “Does it have
something to do with your birthday?”
I
placed my hands over my face as I stood behind the island.
“It’s
okay, sweetheart.” She walked over and wrapped her arms around me. “Whatever
happened, it can’t be that bad.”
“Oh,
but it is, and I’m scared to tell you.”
She
broke our embrace and firmly gripped my shoulders.
“Take
in a long deep breath. Come on. Do it.”
I did
as she asked.
“Another
one,” she spoke.
I took
in another deep breath and let it out.
“One
more. Good girl. Now, tell me what happened.”
The
water was ready for our tea, so I poured it into two cups that housed green
teabags and took them over to the couch.
“After
the conference Friday, Jamieson and I hung out all day. We drank a lot. It was
my idea because I just wanted to forget about that day. I needed to forget. We
both drank an obscene amount of alcohol and the next morning when we woke up,
we found out that we were married.”
“WHAT?!”
she shouted as she placed her hand over her heart.
“I
told you I was scared to tell you. Don’t make it any worse than it already is.”
Tears filled my eyes.
“Grace
Elizabeth Harper. How the hell did that happen?”
“I
don’t know. Neither one of us remembers,” I cried. “Aunt Cora, my life is so
fucked up. What is wrong with me?”
“Nothing
is wrong with you, darling,” she spoke as she took hold of my hands. “You’re
just going through a difficult time and you did something stupid.”
All of
a sudden, she began to laugh. It was like a hysterical laugh and I couldn’t
believe she did that.
“Aunt
Cora?”
“I’m
sorry, Grace. But if you really stop to think about it, you’re Mrs. Jamieson
Finn.” She laughed harder. “Of all people. Oh my goodness, I can imagine him now.”
“This
isn’t funny!”
“No,
of course it isn’t. I’m sorry. So now what?”
“Jamieson
called his lawyer and we’re getting the marriage annulled as soon as possible.
You can’t tell anyone about this. Please. I promised Jamieson I wouldn’t tell
anyone.”
“Don’t
you worry about that. By the way, where is Jamieson?”
“I
don’t know. He told me that we can’t be friends anymore and our relationship
from now on is strictly professional.”
“And
how did you feel when he told you that?”
“A
little hurt and confused. I told him that it was not only my birthday, but also
the day my parents died. He didn’t say anything but that we needed to stay out
of each other’s way. How could he be so heartless? Do you know anything about
his family?” I asked.
“No. I
can’t say that I do. The only thing I know is that his father has his own
urology practice in Beverly Hills. I do know that he is an only child.”
“We
ran into his father and step-mother in Las Vegas and the tension between
Jamieson and him was unreal. I said something about his mother and he yelled at
me. He told me to shut my mouth and to never mention her again.”
“He has
his own demons he’s battling, sweetheart, and walking away from any type of
emotion has become normal for him. It’s probably all he knows.”
“I
don’t care. He’s rude and insensitive. I don’t talk about what happened. I
never even told Sam. But I told Jamieson.”
“Don’t
you think that it’s weird you never told Sam what happened to your parents? I
mean, this was the man you were so in love with. When you’re in love with someone,
you want them to know everything about you, especially a big part of your
past.”
“What
are you saying?” I narrowed my eye at her. “Are you insinuating that I’m in
love with Jamieson? I only told him because I was in shock and a marriage was the
last thing I needed on that day.”
“Okay.”
She slowly nodded.
“Okay?
God, Aunt Cora, I hate when you do that. You can’t just say ‘okay’.”
“Darling,
you don’t want to hear what I have to say.” She kissed my forehead. “Go get
yourself ready for dinner. I’m taking you out.”







Chapter Twenty-Eight

Jamieson
The
next morning, I went in the back way of the hospital to avoid seeing Grace. It
was eventually inevitable that we were going to run into each other, especially
when she needed a consult on a patient. I just prayed that wasn’t today. I had
just finished my morning rounds when my pager went off and I was needed down in
the ER. That sure as hell didn’t last long.
“Someone
paged me?” I walked into trauma room two and saw Grace standing over a patient.
“I
did,” she spoke without looking at me. “Patient was hit by a truck walking
across the street. She has massive internal bleeding and a skull fracture. Her
heart stopped, but I was able to revive her.”
I
walked over to the patient and checked her eyes with my light.
“Her
pupils aren’t responding and there is no corneal reflex. I’m sorry, Dr. Harper,
your patient is brain dead,” I spoke as I stared into her eyes. “You need to
prepare the family.” I walked out of the room.
As I
was walking to the elevator, I noticed some of the nurses and some of the
doctors staring at me. My pager went off. Renata needed to see me stat. I took
the elevator up to her office and lightly knocked on the door.
“You
needed to see me?”
“Yes,
come in, Dr. Finn, and have a seat. How did your presentation go?”
“It
went good.”
“And
Dr. Harper’s?”
“She
did great. Is this what was so urgent?”
“Renata,
you needed—” Grace stopped speaking when she saw me.
“Come
in and have a seat. I need to speak with both of you. There’s a rumor going
around this hospital that the two of you got married while you were in Las
Vegas.”
“Who would
say that?” I nervously asked.
“Apparently,
someone in this hospital, and I’m not naming names, was in Vegas, in the
elevator with the two of you. This person overheard you say, ‘We’ll call my
attorney and see how quickly we can get this marriage annulled.’ This person
also said that the two of you looked panicked. So, you two better come clean
now!” she spoke through gritted teeth.
“Shit.”
I placed my hand over my face.
“Did you
just say ‘shit,’ Dr. Finn?”
“It’s
true,” Grace spoke in calm soft voice. “Dr. Finn and I did get married in Las
Vegas, but it was a mistake and we’re having it annulled as quickly as
possible. We were drunk.”
“Drunk?
You were drunk?” she voiced loudly. “So it isn’t just a rumor, then?”
“No,
Renata, it’s not,” Grace replied.
“And
you!” She pointed at me. “What the hell did I tell you?”
“It
happened,” I voiced loudly. “We were heavily intoxicated and didn’t know what
we were doing. We are getting it taken care of immediately. No one was supposed
to ever know. Shit.”
“Shit
is right. Now the whole hospital is talking, so expect some backlash, Dr. Finn,
from all the heartbroken nurses who wanted more from you.”
“Are
we done here?” I got up from my seat. “I have an aneurysm I need to clip.”
“You
may go, but Grace stays.”
****
Grace
“How
did this happen?” Renata asked as she took a seat next to me.
“I
don’t know. Neither one of us remembers anything from that night.”
“Why
on earth would you drink like that? That isn’t like you. Did you do this on
your birthday?”
“Yes.
Usually on my birthday, I make sure to take a double shift at the hospital.
That way, I’m so busy I don’t have time to think about it. I figured if I just
spent the day drinking, I wouldn’t have to. Then we met this couple there and
spent a majority of the day with them. After dinner is when everything else is
a total blank. Jamieson told me that it’s best we stay out of each other’s way.
He doesn’t even want to be friends anymore.”
“Typical
Jamieson. Screw them and leave them. Or in this case, marry them and leave
them. I’m not the least bit surprised. Are you okay?” She placed her hand on my
arm.
“Yeah.”
I gave her a small smile. “I never should have come back here. I left New York
to get away from my ex-boyfriend. We dated for over a year until I found out he
was married. I didn’t know, Renata, just like I don’t know how Jamieson and I
got married. How can I be so stupid?”
“You’re
not stupid, Grace. Both of those men are stupid. You’re a highly intelligent
trauma surgeon. You’re human, just like everyone else. We all make mistakes in
life. Some start making them a little later in life than others.”
My
phone dinged with a text message, and when I pulled it out of my pocket, I saw
it was from Jamieson.
“My lawyer just called. We need to
be in court tomorrow at noon.”
“Okay.”
“That
was Jamieson. We have a court date tomorrow at noon.”
“That
was fast. But I guess when you have the kind of money he does, you can get
things done quickly. Too bad, though.” She smiled. “I would have liked to have
seen him sweat it out for at least a couple of weeks.”
I
couldn’t help but laugh.
“By
the way, my Aunt Cora is in town and she said she will be dropping by to see
you later.”
“Really?”
She grinned. “It’ll be good to see her.”
I left
her office and went down to the ER, where I saw Jackie sitting behind her
computer. She quickly got up, grabbed my arm, and led me into the on-call room.
“Is it
true?” she asked. “For the love of God, please tell me it’s just a rumor.”
“I wish
I could, Jackie. Jamieson and I got hitched in Vegas.”
“Grace,
what the fuck?”
“We
were drunk. Really, really drunk. Neither one of us remembers exactly what happened.”
“And
you know for sure it’s legit?”
“Oh,
it’s legit all right. I have the proof of marriage certificate to prove it. We
woke up the next morning with gold bands on our fingers.”
She
hugged me tight.
“You
poor thing. I’m so sorry.”
“It’s
okay. I won’t be Mrs. Jamieson Finn for long. We have a court date to get the
marriage annulled tomorrow at noon.”
The ER
was slammed, and I was grateful because it kept me busy all day long. Once I
had a break, I went up to the rooftop to grab a cup of coffee. As I stepped off
the elevator, I saw Jamieson sitting at one of the tables. He looked at me, and
I at him. Then he went back to staring at his phone. I walked over to where the
coffee was and poured myself a cup. When I turned around, he was standing
behind me.
“I
told you my lawyer would handle this quickly,” he spoke. “By this time
tomorrow, our marriage will be annulled, and it will be as if it never
happened.”
“I
never doubted you for a second, and as far as I’m concerned, it never did.” I
walked away.
****
Jamieson
I was
lying in bed, going over some notes, when I decided to send a text message to
Grace.
“Hey, we can drive to the
courthouse together tomorrow.”
“I can drive myself.”
“But we’re going to the same place.
It doesn’t make sense to drive separate.”
“It makes perfect sense, Dr. Finn.
Good night.”
I
clenched my jaw and slowly shook my head before tossing my phone down next to
me.
****
Grace
“That
was Jamieson. He said we can drive to the courthouse together tomorrow,” I
spoke to my Aunt Cora.
“And?”
Her brow arched as she stared at me.
“I
told him I can drive myself.”
“Okay.
But it does make sense for the two of you to drive together. There’s parking
fees and a lot of traffic. Let him handle it.”
“I’ll
take the parking fees and traffic. It’s better than sitting in a car with him.”
“And
now you’re in the angry stage,” Aunt Cora spoke.
“You
bet I’m angry. He’s a jerk. A man with no emotions whatsoever. Maybe someone
needs to cut into his brain to find out what’s going on in there. And to think
I once called him a saint. He’s more like the damn devil.”
My
Aunt Cora let out a laugh.
“When
did you call him a saint?” she asked.
“The
night we met in New York. He got the woman who was sitting next to him a cab
and sent her home because she was drunk. He did tell me right then and there
that he was far from being a saint. I should have heeded his warning.”







Chapter Twenty-Nine

Grace
“There
you are. I was looking for you,” Jamieson spoke as I walked out of room six.
“Why?”
I asked while looking down at the patient’s chart.
“The
offer still stands. We can drive together to the courthouse.”
“And
my answer is still the same. I’m driving myself.” I handed the chart to Jackie.
“Suit
yourself, and you better not be late,” he spoke with irritation as he walked
away.
“You
okay?” she asked.
“I’m
great. I’ve already saved a life today and my drunken marriage is getting
annulled. Couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day.” I smiled.
“Is
your Aunt Cora still in town?”
“No.
She flew back to New York this morning. She has patients she needs to see.”
I
climbed in my car, punched the address to the courthouse into my GPS, and
pulled out of the hospital parking lot. I made sure to leave early enough to
account for the L.A. traffic. I wasn’t taking any chances of being late. I was
stopped at a light, waiting for it to turn green, when the crosswalk light
turned for the pedestrian to walk. I looked down at my phone for a split second
and I heard the screeching of tires and a loud thump. When I looked up, the boy
who had been crossing at the crosswalk was now lying in the middle of the road.
“Oh my
God,” I yelled as I quickly grabbed my stethoscope from the passenger seat, got
out of my car, and ran over to him. “I need you to stay very still. Someone
call 911,” I yelled as I looked around at the people starting to gather around
us. “I’m a doctor and I’m going to stay with you until the paramedics get here.
Can you tell me your name?”
“Justin.”
He trembled.
“How
old are you, Justin?” I asked as I took off my suit coat and carefully placed
it under his head.
“Sixteen.
I can’t feel my legs.”
“You’re
going to be okay.” I listened to his chest.
I
could hear the siren of the ambulance approaching as I lifted Justin’s shirt
and examined his abdomen.
“Dr.
Harper?” Aiden, the paramedic spoke as he ran over to us.
“Sixteen-year-old
male hit by a vehicle. Muffled breath sounds on the left side, abdominal
distention, broken leg, and potential spinal injury. He can’t feel his legs.
Stabilize his neck and back and start him on oxygen stat.”
“I
can’t breathe,” Justin mumbled.
“Dr.
Harper, his pressure is dropping.”
I
placed the stethoscope on his chest again.
“Damn
it, he has fluid rising in his chest. I need to insert a chest tube. Get me the
kit.”
Aiden
ran to the ambulance and brought back the chest tube kit.
“Justin,
this is going to hurt, but I have no choice.”
Screams
emerged from him as I made the incision and inserted the chest tube.
“I
have to be in court like five minutes ago. Get him to the ER now. I’ll make the
call and let them know you’re coming,” I spoke to Aiden. “Justin, the
paramedics are going to take you to the hospital and I’ll make sure a team of
doctors are waiting for you. When I get back there, I’ll check on you.” I
grabbed his hand.
“Thank
you,” he whispered.
I
stood up and looked down at my white shirt that had blood splattered all over
it.
“Excuse
me, Dr. Harper?” an officer spoke. “I need you to make a statement.”
“I
didn’t see anything. I was looking down at my phone. I will try to answer your
questions at the hospital, but for now, I have to go. I was supposed to be in
court and I’m late.”
I
climbed in my car and took off. My phone rang, and Jamieson was calling.
“Hello.”
“Where
the hell are you?” he angrily spoke.
“I had
to save someone’s life. I’m ten minutes away.”
He
hung up without so much as saying a word.
“Asshole.”
I spoke as I looked at the phone.
I
dialed the ER and Marjorie, one of the nurses, answered.
“This
is Dr. Harper. An ambulance is on its way with a sixteen-year-old male who was
struck by a vehicle. Page ortho, cardio, and neuro. I want a trauma panel, CT
of the head, spine, and abdomen. Patient can’t feel his legs. He has multiple
fractures and abdominal distention. I had to insert a chest tube. Make sure everyone
is ready and that boy better be alive when I get back.”
“Yes,
Dr. Harper.”
I pulled
into the parking garage, threw the car in park, and climbed out.
“Ma’am,
what do you think you’re doing?”
“Park
this for me. I’m so late and already in trouble,” I spoke as I ran to the
building.
“Ma’am,
you can’t—” he shouted.
I
found the courtroom and ran through the doors. Everyone turned around and
looked at me.
“Dr.
Harper, I presume?” the judge spoke with irritation.
“I’m
sorry, your Honor. A kid was hit by a car crossing the crosswalk in front of
me. He had severe injuries.”
“Is
that blood all over your clothing?” she asked.
“I’m so
sorry. It was an emergency and I didn’t have time to change.”
“Is
the boy going to be okay?” she asked.
“I
hope so.”
Jamieson
glanced over at me, but I wouldn’t look at him.
“Dr.
Grace Harper and Dr. Jamieson Finn, please approach,” the judge spoke. “This
court has received your paperwork and request for the annulment of your recent
marriage in Las Vegas. Correct?”
“Yes,
your Honor,” Jamieson and I spoke at the same time.
“Let
me ask you this. Why did the two of you get married in the first place?”
“It
was a mistake, your Honor. We had too much to drink and weren’t thinking
clearly,” Jamieson spoke.
“Do
you agree, Dr. Harper?” She looked at me.
“Yes.”
I nodded my head.
She
stared at me for a moment and then at Jamieson.
“I am
scheduling you to come back to this courtroom one week from today at ten a.m.
for my decision.”
“Excuse
me, your Honor?” Jamieson’s lawyer spoke up.
“Is
there a problem, Mr. Riggs?” Her brow arched.
“It
just seems unusual for my clients to have to come back here. This case is
pretty much cut and dry. Both parties agree that a mistake was made, and they
do not wish to be married.”
“It’s
my decision and the decision of this court. I will see both of you one week
from today. Dr. Harper, try to be on time.”
“Yes,
your Honor.” I swallowed hard.
“Court
is adjourned.”
She
got up from her chair and went into her chambers.
“Tony,
what the fuck is going on?” Jamieson asked through gritted teeth.
“I
don’t know, Jamieson. This is highly unusual,” he spoke. “There’s nothing I can
do. She made her decision. I’ll see you both back here next week.” He turned
and walked away.
Jamieson
looked at me and shook his head.
“This
is your fault!” He pointed at me. “If you weren’t so damn late.”
“What
did you want me to do? That boy’s life was at stake.”
“Yeah,
well, you wouldn’t have been there if you would have just driven with me!” He
walked away.
I
followed behind his dumb ass.
“He
can’t feel his legs. So you better hurry up and get to the hospital.”
He
shook his head all the way out the door. I went to the parking garage and
looked at the attendant, who was standing there giving me dirty looks.
“Can I
have my car, please?” I cocked my head.
“Yeah,
and you can also have this parking ticket,” he spoke as he handed me my keys.
“Thanks
a lot.” I narrowed my eye at him.
I
rushed back to the hospital, changed into a pair of scrubs, and headed to the
OR.
“I’m
here. What’s going on?”
“Just
about to remove his spleen,” Dr. Collins spoke.
“I got
it from here. Did you get the spinal x-rays yet?” I asked as I took over.
“They’re
up and we’ve already paged Dr. Finn.”
“Goodie,”
I spoke with sarcasm.
The OR
door opened, and Jamieson stepped in, holding a mask over his mouth and nose.
“Is
this your patient, Dr. Harper?” he asked.
“Yep.
His spinal x-rays are up. Can you take a look?”
“His
L6 is completely obliterated. There’s no way I can fix that. Your patient is
paralyzed from the waist down. He’ll never walk again.”
I
turned my head and our eyes locked onto each other’s.
“He’s
sixteen,” I spoke.
“I
wish there was something I could do, but there isn’t.” He walked out of the OR.







Chapter Thirty

Jamieson
I was
standing at the nurses’ station finishing up a patient’s chart, when Grace came
storming over to me.
“Electrode
implants,” she spoke.
“What?”
“There’s
a trial in Switzerland.”
“Has
it been successful?” I asked as I cocked my head.
“So
far on rats and monkeys.” She bit her lower lip.
I
sighed, handed my chart to the nurse, and walked away.
“He’s
sixteen years old!” Grace shouted. “He has his whole life ahead of him.”
“You’re
telling me that this trial hasn’t even been done on humans and you want it done
on your patient? Grace, come on.”
“If
there is even the slightest chance, even if it’s one percent, that this boy can
walk again, you’re damn right I want it done.”
“Where
did you hear about this trial?” I asked out of curiosity.
“I
read about it. If you’re waiting for me to apologize for being late today to court,
I won’t. My first and foremost priority is saving people’s lives. When we’re
faced with a crisis and it comes to a patient’s life, everything else stops,
including a court date.”
“Send
me the information on the trial and I’ll take a look at it.”
“I will.
Thank you.”
“I’m
not making any promises, Grace. I’m not God.”
“Really?
You sure as hell act like you are.” Her brow arched, and she walked away.
I
rolled my eyes and went to my office. I couldn’t believe that this marriage
wasn’t annulled today. Total bullshit. That’s what it was. And I know it had
something to do with her being so late. It didn’t matter, though. I would have
done the same thing. All was quiet for the time being, so I went to my research
room and pulled up all my notes and scans on the monitors that were hung on the
wall around the room. It was where I spent almost all of my time. It was
research I’d been working on for years. It was something that was extremely
important to me.
****
One
Week Later
A week
had passed, and I barely saw Grace at all. A consult here and a consult there.
It was better that way. For both our sakes.
“Dr.
Finn, what are you doing here? I didn’t think you’d come in until after your
court hearing,” Renata spoke.
“I was
paged a few hours ago. One of my patients coded and I had to open his head back
up. At that point, why bother going home.”
“Is
your patient okay?”
“He is
now.” I smiled.
It was
almost time to leave, so I went down to the ER to get Grace. She didn’t know
she was riding with me and I wasn’t giving her a choice.
“Jackie,
where’s Grace?” I asked.
“You
mean your wife?” She smirked.
“Stop
that.” I sighed. “Where is she?”
“She
took the morning off.”
“Damn
it.”
I
pulled my phone from my pocket and dialed her number.
“Yes,
Dr. Finn,” she answered.
“I’m
coming to pick you up. You’re driving with me.”
“Then
you’ll have to pick me up at the coffee shop across the street from the
courthouse because that’s where I am right now enjoying a hot cup of coffee.”
“Oh. I’ll
be at the courthouse soon. Try to make sure nobody gets hit by a car before you
get there.”
I
arrived at the courthouse and saw Grace and Tony standing outside the
courtroom.
“Good
morning, Jamieson.” He smiled.
“Morning,
Tony. Grace,” I spoke as I gave a slight nod of my head.
We entered
the courtroom, took our seats, and waited to be called. The judge entered the
courtroom and took her seat.
“Welcome
back, Dr. Finn. Dr. Harper. Happy to see you’re both on time today. “Dr.
Harper, how is the boy you helped last week?”
“He’s
paralyzed, your Honor. But I’m hoping with Dr. Finn’s help, he will have a
chance to walk again.”
Why the hell would she tell the
judge that? I took
in a deep breath and just wanted this over with as quickly as possible. 
“Let’s
hope that happens. Now, moving on to the reason why you are back in my
courtroom. You have filed to have your marriage annulled. Dr. Finn, you are one
of the best neurosurgeons in the country, and Dr. Harper, you are one of the
best trauma surgeons around. You’re both young and so incredibly successful for
your ages. The thing that I’ve thought about over the past week, after having
my clerk gather some information on the both of you, is why would these two extremely
intelligent doctors, who barely know each other, decide on the spur of the moment
to get hitched while attending a medical conference in Las Vegas? Any answers?”
She looked at me and Grace.
“We
made a mistake, your Honor,” I spoke.
“Your Honor,
they were highly intoxicated and not of sound mind,” Tony spoke.
“Blah,
blah, blah.” She waved her hand. “You know what I love? I love when people
screw up their lives or make mistakes, and instead of taking responsibility
themselves, they blame the alcohol. Maybe you shouldn’t have drunk so much.”
She glared at us. “With that being said, I am denying the annulment of your
marriage for at least six more months.”
A
sickness settled in the pit of my stomach as I started to profusely sweat.
“What
the fuck, Tony?” I whispered.
“Your Honor.
My clients and I aren’t quite sure what’s going on here.”
“I’ll
tell you what’s going on. It is the decision of this court that the marriage
between Dr. Jamieson Finn and Dr. Grace Harper stays as is for six more months
with the following rules set in place: Dr. Harper will move into Dr. Finn’s beach
home, where they will reside as roommates for the next six months. I have
already ordered your apartment complex to change your locks first thing
tomorrow morning. So, I would advise you, Dr. Harper, to gather your things
after leaving this courthouse. Also, there will be someone visiting your home,
Dr. Finn, once a week to make sure that Dr. Harper is indeed staying there.”
“Your Honor,
you can’t do that!” I shouted.
“Dr.
Finn, I can do anything I please. If you want to make it a full year, I can
change it right now.”
“Jamieson,
don’t say another word,” Tony spoke.
****
Grace
I
stood there in shock and took in a deep breath to prevent going straight into a
panic attack. Why the hell was she doing this? The last thing I wanted to do
was live with that man.
“I’m
sorry, your Honor, but I need an explanation as to why you’re doing this to
us?” I softly and calmly spoke.
“Why,
Dr. Harper? I’ll tell you why. The two of you were incredibly irresponsible.
I’m sure during your inebriated state, you thought it would be fun to go and
get married without realizing the consequences after the fact. You both took
something sacred and made a mockery of it. I would hate to think that either
one of you would act so reckless in the operating room. Let this be a lesson to
both of you. I’m sure your attorney will appeal this decision, which I will
tell you right now is a waste of your money. This case, if you are lucky, will
get to the appellate court maybe in a year. I will see you back here in six
months. Court is adjourned.”
I
slowly sank down in the chair behind me as Jamieson stared at me.
“Can
she do this?” I asked Tony.
“She’s
the judge. This is her courtroom. She can do anything she wants.”
I took
in a deep breath as I stood up to leave.
“We’re
appealing this,” Jamieson spoke as we followed Tony out of the courtroom. 
“Jamieson,
it’s going to take longer than six months. Listen, my best advice to you both
is to just co-exist. You’re both doctors and have very busy schedules. You
won’t even see each other that much at home,” Tony spoke. “It’s only six months.
It could be worse. Just deal with it and it’ll be over with before you know
it.”
“This
is unacceptable, Tony!” Jamieson harshly spoke.
“Jamieson,
that’s enough!” I shouted at him. “We don’t have a choice, so just shut up!” I
stormed out of the building.
“Grace!”
he yelled as he ran after me and grabbed my arm. “This is not okay.”
“No,
it’s not! But like I said, we have no choice. I’ll stay out of your way and you
stay out of mine.”
****
I left
the hospital around seven thirty, went to my apartment, packed my bags, and drove
over to Jamieson’s house.
“Hey,”
Jamieson spoke as he opened the door.
“Hey.”
“Is
that all you brought?” he asked as he stared at my one suitcase.
“No.
My other bags are in the car.”
“I can
go get the rest of them.”
“No. I
can do it. Just tell me which room I’ll be staying in.”
“Up
the stairs, first door on the right.”
I took
my suitcase up the stairs and opened the door to the room that I’d be staying
in for the next six months. I felt sick. I hated leaving my apartment behind.
Especially when I was still paying rent and couldn’t live in it. I’d finally
made it into a home, my home. A place where it felt good to go to after a long,
exhausting day at the hospital. Now, I’d be staying in a place that didn’t feel
so good. A place where I didn’t want to be, and I wasn’t welcomed.
I went
downstairs to grab the rest of my things from the car and I saw Jamieson walk
in with my other suitcase and my bags.
“What
are you doing? I told you I got it.”
“I
know, but I wasn’t going to let you do it all by yourself while I just stand
here. I’m not that much of an asshole.”
“Yeah.
Okay,” I spoke with sarcasm. “Anyway, thanks.” I went to grab them from him.
“I can
carry it up, Grace. Stop being so stubborn.”
I
rolled my eyes and started walking up the stairs while he followed behind.
Suddenly, I stopped mid-step and turned around.
“This
whole pretending to be nice is starting to get on my nerves, and I’ve only been
here ten minutes. Just stop, Jamieson. You don’t want me here and I don’t want
to be here. So let’s stop the fakeness and do our own thing.”
“Wow,
you really hate me, don’t you?” he spoke.
“No.”
I slowly shook my head as I sat down on the step. “I don’t hate you. It’s just
that judge is an idiot and it really bothered me what she said about us being
reckless in the operating room. Who the fuck is she to say something like that?”
He set
down my suitcase and sat down on the step with me. 
“She
doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about. Maybe other surgeons are
reckless in the operating room, but not us. I’ve seen you operate and you’re
incredibly skilled and talented.”
“Thanks.”
I gave him a small smile. “So are you.”
“Listen,
Grace, I’m going to be very honest with you. I don’t like to share my things
with anyone and I like living alone. All my things have their place and I tend
to get anxious if anyone messes with that.”
“Are
you like OCD or something?” I arched my brow at him.
“No.
It stems from my childhood. But don’t ask because I’m not telling you
anything.”
“Honestly,
I don’t even want to know. I gave up trying to figure you out.” I smirked.
“Even if you are my husband.”
He
chuckled. “That word really gets to me. I don’t want to be anybody’s husband,
no offense.”
“None
taken.” I smiled.







Chapter Thirty-One

Jamieson
Living
in the same house with her wasn’t going to be easy. No matter what happened
between us and how angry I was, she was still one of the most beautiful women
I’d ever seen, and I couldn’t stop thinking about all the sex we’d had. What I
wouldn’t give to go into her bedroom, throw her on the bed, and fuck the life
out of her. But I couldn’t. Things between us were different now. Once this got
out at the hospital, my sex life would go to shit. What the fuck was I going to
do? I just had to keep telling myself that it was only for six months, but it
felt like more of a life sentence.
Grace
was in her room and I was headed to bed. It was late, and I was sure she was
sound asleep. As I passed by her bedroom, I heard her talking. Her light was
off, so I slowly opened the door to check on her. I found her standing in the
corner of the room, in the pitch dark, repeating the same thing over and over
again.
“Time
of death,” she spoke.
“Time
of death.”
“Time
of death.”
I
turned on the light in the hallway and stepped inside the room. Walking over to
her, I placed my hand on her shoulder.
“Grace.”
“Time
of death,” she spoke as she looked at me.
I took
hold of her arm and walked her over to the bed.
“Get
back into bed,” I spoke as I covered her with the sheet.
She
rolled over on her side and tucked her hands underneath the pillow. I walked
out of the room, and before shutting the door, I looked at her one last time.
What was going on in that head of hers?
The
next morning, I walked downstairs, and she was already up and had the coffee
made.
“Good
morning,” I spoke.
“Good
morning. I was just leaving.”
“How
did you sleep?” I asked.
“Pretty
good. That bed is really comfortable.” She lightly smiled.
“No
nightmares or dreams?”
“Why
are you asking?”
“It’s
just I was on my way to bed and I heard you talking. I opened your door to
check on you and you were standing in the corner of the bedroom repeating ‘time
of death.’ Last night wasn’t the first time I heard you say that in your sleep.”
“Oh.
Well, if I was, I don’t remember. I have to go. I don’t want to be late.” She
grabbed her purse.
When I
arrived at the hospital, I went straight to my research room. I didn’t have any
surgeries scheduled for today, so I figured while it was quiet, I’d do some
research on the electrode implants.
“Is it
official?” Renata asked as she walked in. “Is your marriage annulled?”
“Good
morning to you too, Renata. No. It is not annulled.” I sighed.
“Why
not? What happened now?”
“You’re
going to love this. You better have a seat.” I gestured with my hand. “The
judge ordered Grace to move into my beach house for six months. She basically
said it was our punishment for being so reckless and mocking the sacrament of
marriage.”
Renata
held back a laugh until she couldn’t anymore.
“You’re
kidding. So now you and Grace are living together? At your house?”
“Yep.”
“And
she’s still your wife?”
“Yep.”
“This
is karma in its highest form.” She laughed. “Well, not for that poor girl, but
for you.”
“I’m
glad you think it’s so funny. Don’t you have people to boss around? I’m trying
to work here.”
“I’m
going to go down and check on that poor girl and make sure she’s okay.”
“Renata,
can I ask you something?”
“Sure,
what it is?”
“Last
night I found Grace standing in the corner of her bedroom. She was sleeping but
repeating the words ‘time of death’ over and over again. Do you have any idea
why? It isn’t the first time I’ve heard her say that in her sleep.”
She
stared at me for a few moments with a look of hesitation.
“She
calls time of death all the time. Maybe it bothers her.”
“Yeah.
Maybe,” I spoke.
I
continued with my research and then got on the phone and called the doctor in
Switzerland.
****
Grace
I
stood on the deck and stared out at the sand and listened to the whispers of
the ocean. As I looked out, I saw my parents and me. A memory before they died.
It was a hot and sunny day and we wanted to spend it at the beach. My mom would
set up three chairs with an umbrella large enough to shade us from the sun. She
would read, and my dad and I would play in the sand building sandcastles and go
swimming in the ocean. Not many people could say they had a perfect childhood.
I wasn’t one of those people. Mine was perfect up until I turned ten years old.
“What
are you doing?” Jamieson asked.
“Shit.
You startled me.” I placed my hand over my heart.
“Sorry.
I didn’t mean to.”
“I’m
just taking in this beautiful view.”
“Did
you eat yet?” he asked.
“No. I
was just thinking about making something.”
“Let’s
order in. There’s something I need to talk to you about.”
“Okay.”
We
placed an order for Chinese food. While we were waiting for it to be delivered,
I went upstairs to change into something more comfortable while Jamieson set
the table. The food arrived, and I was a little nervous as to what he had to
talk to me about.
“I did
some research on the electrode implants and I talked to the doctor in
Switzerland. They did a trial but haven’t published it yet. Ten patients, ten
implants, and all ten failed. The patients were still paralyzed. I’m sorry,
Grace, but Justin’s L6 was crushed. You saw the X-rays. I think you’re asking
for the impossible here. The implant won’t work, and I don’t want to get that
kid’s hopes up.”
“Nothing
is impossible, Jamieson. Impossible is a word you of all people shouldn’t be
using. You’re a brilliant neurosurgeon. You remove brain tumors that no other
doctor in the world would touch. You’ve done the impossible. So how can you sit
there and say that to me?”
“Because
it’s a fact! And I will not give that boy hope when there isn’t any.”
“Figure
it out, Jamieson. Take the research they’ve already done and figure it out. I
know for a fact you’ve done deep brain stimulation for certain diseases.”
“That’s
different and you know it. Or maybe you don’t because you’re not a
neurosurgeon.”
“Please,
just try.”
 “I can’t. I don’t have time anyway. I’m in the
middle of something else.”
“Oh,
that’s right, your schizophrenia research. You really think you’re going to
find a cure for that? You have a better chance at helping someone walk. And
what’s your obsession with it anyway? Do you know someone who is
schizophrenic?”
“I’ve
seen patients with it and it’s a horrible way to live. If I can help them
return to their normal lives, then I’m going to do it,” he spoke in a harsh
tone.
“But
yet you won’t try to help a sixteen-year-old kid who was just crossing the
street and was ran down by an erratic driver walk again? You won’t try to help
him return to his normal life? You know what, Jamieson? All this shit you’re
doing for schizophrenia is nothing but a pipedream.”
“Get
the hell out of my house!” he shouted as he flipped his plate of food over on
the table, knocking over a glass as it hit the floor and shattered.
“I
would if I could, but I can’t!” I shouted back.
He
threw his napkin across the table and stormed out of the kitchen. I took in a
long deep breath to try and calm my racing heart. I shouldn’t have said what I
did. I knelt down on the floor to clean up his damn mess and my knee slipped on
a wet spot and my arm slid across the broken glass.
“Shit!”
I yelled. “Damn it!” I held up my arm as blood profusely dripped from it.
I
officially hated Dr. Jamieson Finn. I grabbed a towel and tightly wrapped it
around my arm. Opening the front door, I ran to my car and grabbed my medical
bag. When I stepped back inside the house, I saw Jamieson coming down the stairs.
“I
thought maybe you left. What the hell happened?” he asked as he stared at the blood-soaked
towel wrapped around my arm.
“Nothing.
Leave me alone!”
I
raced up the stairs and into the bathroom and locked the door. Taking a seat on
the toilet, I opened my medical bag and took out my suture kit.
“Grace
Harper, open up this door!” He pounded.
“I
told you to leave me alone!”
“Too
fucking bad. You’re hurt. Let me see.”
“No!”
“Grace,
I’m warning you!”
“Warn
all you want, Jamieson. I’m not afraid of you!”
All of
a sudden, the lock popped, and Jamieson opened the door.
“Oh my
God. Will you please just leave me alone?” I spoke.
“Let me
see it,” he calmly spoke as he approached me.
“I can
stitch it up myself. So please leave and let me get to it.”
He
carefully took hold of my arm and examined the wound.
“You
have a couple small pieces of glass in there. I need to get them out before I
stitch you up. Where did you get that medical bag?”
“My
car.”
“You
keep a fully stocked medical bag in your car?” The corners of his mouth curved
upwards.
“Yes.
In case of an emergency. Like this one!” I cocked my head.
“Grace,
I’m sorry. This happened to you because of me. I didn’t mean—”
“Don’t
apologize. I’m sorry for what I said. I never should have said that. This is my
punishment for being mean.”
“It
looks like you’ll need about four or five stitches. Do you want to do a couple
shots of tequila before I get started?” He grinned. “You seem nervous.”
“The
only thing I’m nervous about is you not doing it perfectly and leaving me with
a scar. I won’t leave a scar. So hand over the sutures and let me stitch
myself.”
“I’m
not going to leave a scar. I can promise you that. Are you ready?”
“I’ll
be watching you very carefully, Dr. Finn.” I narrowed my eye at him.
He
removed the couple pieces of glass from my arm and then perfectly stitched it
up.
“There.
All done.”
“Thanks.
You did good.” I smiled as I stared into his eyes. “I still hate you.”
“Yeah,
well, I hate you too.” He grinned.
He
brought his hand up to my cheek and softly stroked it before his lips leaned
into mine. His kiss was soft and sensual. After enjoying his warm lips for a
moment, I pulled back and he looked at me in confusion.
“I’m
not having sex with you,” I softly spoke as I got up from the toilet seat.
“Grace,”
he spoke.
I stopped
before walking out the door, my back still turned to him.
“You
made it very clear that our relationship was to be kept on a professional level
and that we would not be having sex again. You stitched me up and we had a
moment. We can’t go back. Things have changed between us. We resent each other
for what happened, and having sex isn’t going to change that. When it’s all
over, nothing will be different. We will still resent each other.”
“You’re
right,” he spoke as he pushed past me, went to his room and slammed the door
shut.






Chapter Thirty-Two

Two
Weeks Later
Jamieson
I
threw my pen at the computer, sighed, and leaned back in my chair. I was
exhausted and frustrated. My life was shit. Ever since Grace came to town, my
life had been turned upside down.
“There
you are. I’ve been looking for you,” Logan spoke. “I sent you like a million
text messages and you haven’t responded.”
“Sorry.
I’ve been really busy. Is there something you need?”
“No.
We haven’t hung out in a while. I just want to make sure you’re okay. How is it
living with Grace?”
“Total
hell. That’s how it is. We haven’t spoken a word to each other in two weeks at
home, and she’s a total cock blocker. Not one nurse in this hospital will have
sex with me because of her.”
“Have
you actually asked them?”
“No.
But I hear them whispering.”
“Then
go out and find some chick to have sex with,” he spoke.
“It’s
not that simple.”
“What
are you talking about?” He laughed. “Sure it is. Wait a minute. Would you feel
guilty or something because you’re married?”
I
looked away from him.
“Jamieson,
come on. You and Grace are only married by signatures on a piece of paper. It’s
not a real marriage.”
“I
know that.”
“I
don’t get it, bro. If the two of you are living in the same house, why aren’t
you sleeping together? I mean, I know you’re pissed about this whole situation,
but it’s just sex. She has needs too.”
“She
won’t because I made it very clear after I found out we were married that our
relationship is going to be strictly professional and there will be no sex.”
“Well,
did you try to have sex with her?”
“Yeah.
I kissed her that night I stitched up her arm. I really thought it was going to
happen. I wanted it to happen, but she stopped it and reminded me of my words.”
“Ah,
so she’s punishing you. You do realize that’s what she’s doing, right?”
“I
guess. Who the fuck knows.”
He
placed his hand on my shoulder.
“You’re
going to get through this, buddy. To be honest, it doesn’t have to be this
hard. It only is because the two of you are making it that way.” He walked out
of the room.
My
pager went off and I was needed down in the ER. As soon as I stepped off the
elevator, I reached back and held the door open as a team of doctors were racing
a gurney towards it with Grace on top of the patient. As they approached, and I
got a closer look. She had her hand inside the patient’s chest. She stared at
me with a somber look as they pushed the gurney into the elevator.
“You
got this.” I winked at her.
The
corners of her mouth slightly curved upwards as the elevator doors closed.
****
Grace
“Time
of death, thirteen fifteen,” I spoke as I forcefully removed my scrub cap and
left the OR.
It was
a shit day already and it wasn’t nearly over. I went up to the rooftop to grab
a cup of coffee and when I stepped off the elevator, I saw Jamieson over at the
coffee station.
“Hey,
how’s your patient?”
“Dead,”
I spoke.
“I’m
sorry. Do you have a few minutes so we can sit down and talk?” he asked. “This
seems like the only place we can do that.”
“Talk
about what, Jamieson?” I sighed.
“I
think I might have found a way to help Justin walk again with the electrode
implants.”
“Are
you kidding me?”
“No.
Can we please sit down?”
“Yes,
of course.”
We
took a seat at one of the tables and Jamieson explained to me his plan.
“Now,
I’m going to need you to insert the electrode into the spine while I insert one
in his brain. We have to do it at the exact same time. If we’re even off by a
second, it’s not going to work. We need to put our personal differences aside
and work as a team on this.”
“Of
course. Thank you.” I smiled as I placed my hand on top of his. “Thank you,
Jamieson. I knew you would figure it out.”
“Don’t
thank me yet, Grace. There is still a chance it won’t work, and we need to
prepare Justin for that possibility.”
“I
know,” I spoke as my pager went off. “I’m needed in the ER. We’ll talk later?”
“Sure.”
He nodded with a small smile.
As
soon as I got down to the ER, Jackie told me the patient in room three was asking
for me.
“Justine,
what’s going on?” I asked as I stepped inside the room.
“Dr. Harper,
I haven’t been feeling so good lately.”
Justine
Kent was a patient I had treated two months ago. She came in when she was
brutally beaten by her boyfriend.
“What
symptoms are you experiencing?” I asked.
“I’ve
been having severe headaches and —”
She
stopped speaking and went into a full-blown seizure.
“She’s
seizing,” I spoke as I quickly turned her on her side. “Push five milligrams of
diazepam and page Dr. Finn stat!”
I held
her down, as her seizure wasn’t stopping.
“Dr.
Harper, she’s going into V-fib,” Sara spoke.
“Damn
it. If we shock her during the seizure, it could kill her.”
“How
long has she been seizing?” Jamieson asked as he rushed into the room.
“Over
five minutes,” I spoke.
“How
much diazepam did you give?”
“Five
milligrams.”
“Push
another five,” he spoke as he checked her eyes.
Suddenly,
her seizure stopped, and all her stats started to come back to normal. I let
out a deep breath.
“Isn’t
this the patient who was beaten by her boyfriend a couple months ago?” he
asked.
“Yes.
Before she started seizing, she said she was having severe headaches.”
Suddenly,
there was an overwhelming amount of commotion going on in the ER.
“What
is going on out there?” I asked as I looked at Jamieson.
“I
don’t know. I’ll go check, but we need to get her to CT. Wait here for a
minute.”
“What’s
going on out there?” Justine asked.
“I’m
not sure. But don’t worry.” I placed my hand on her arm. “We’re going to take
you up for a CT scan.”
I
waited for Jamieson, but he didn’t come back. I looked at my watch and I was
starting to get pissed.
“Come
on,” I spoke to Sara. “Let’s take her up.”
We
started wheeling her out of the room and Jackie stared at me with a frightened
look on her face.
“What’s
going on? Who is yelling?” I asked as I walked out of the room.
Suddenly,
I looked over and saw a man standing there pointing a gun and telling everyone
not to move. I froze as my heart rapidly beat. I knew him. He and his mom were
brought in last week after they were involved in a car accident. I was the
attending doctor.
“You!”
His eyes locked on mine. “You were there that night. I remember you. You were
the one who told me that my mom was dead.”
 I swallowed hard. Everyone was standing
perfectly still like statues, too scared to move for fear that he’d shoot them.
Memories started to flood my mind and I was taken back to the night of my tenth
birthday. It was as if it was happening all over again. I saw myself standing
there outside the room where my father was and then outside the room where my
mother was with tears stinging my eyes. I was frightened and alone. I snapped
back to reality as I saw Jamieson standing there, his eyes wide as the man
pointed his gun at me.
“You’re
right, and I’m sorry, Mr. Samson. We did everything we could to save her,” I
calmly spoke.
“You
didn’t!” he screamed as he waved his gun at me. “You could have done more! She
was all I had and now someone has to pay.”
I
stood there for a moment while my heart pounded out of my chest, and suddenly,
something fell over me that I couldn’t explain.
“Go
ahead then, shoot me. Why not?” I smiled as tears filled my eyes. “Maybe this
is the reason I came back here to Los Angeles, to this very hospital. Maybe now
it’s my turn to die here.”
“Grace!”
Jamieson shouted.
“What
the hell are you talking about?” the man asked.
“Twenty
years ago, I was in a car accident with my parents and we were brought to this
hospital. I stood outside each of their rooms as the doctors called time of
death for each one of them. I was ten years old and they were all I had too.
Maybe this is how my life is supposed to end, here in this hospital, just like
I wished it had twenty years ago. Hell, I’ve made some piss poor choices since
then anyway. I dated a man for over a year that I didn’t know was married. I
quit my job in New York, moved here, took a job at the place where I watched my
parents die, and I married a man in Vegas I barely know.” I laughed. “You’re
not the crazy one here, Mr. Samson. I am. So just do me the favor and end it.”
“You’re
a doctor. You’re supposed to save lives,” he spoke. “You were supposed to save
her.”
“I do
save lives and I also lose lives. Sometimes, the injuries are so bad, they
can’t be fixed, no matter how hard we try. Like with your mom and my parents.
Mr. Samson, you don’t want to do this. You don’t want to hurt anyone, and your
mother certainly wouldn’t want you to. You feel guilty because you were the one
driving the car. It’s easier to blame someone else to lessen our own pain and
guilt.”
“You’re
either really brave or really stupid,” he spoke. “But you’re right, it was my
fault she died. She kept telling me to stop texting and I told her not to worry
about it.” He gently put the gun on the floor and security rushed over and
grabbed him.
I let
out a deep breath as I looked over at Jamieson, who was staring at me with fear
in his eyes.
“Sara,
get Justine to CT for a head scan,” I spoke as I turned and walked away.







Chapter Thirty-Three

Grace
I
opened the door to the supply room and stepped inside. Tears streamed down my
face as I sat down on the floor and brought my knees up to my chest. My heart
was still rapidly pounding, and I felt like I couldn’t catch my breath. The
door opened, and when I looked up, I saw Jamieson standing there. He didn’t say
a word. He walked over, sat down, and wrapped his arms around me, pulling me
into him.
“Why,
Grace? Why did you do that? He could have killed you.”
“He
didn’t want to hurt anyone.”
“You
don’t know that.”
“I do
know that.”
I
pulled away from him, wiped my eyes, and stood up.
“We
need to go figure out what’s going on with Justine. Are you coming?” I held out
my hand to him.
“Grace,
I don’t think you—”
“Are
you coming?” I asked in a harsh tone.
He
placed his hand in mine and I helped him up. We went to the CT room and
carefully watched the monitors as pictures of Justine’s brain loaded.
“She has
a serious brain bleed,” he spoke.
“And
that’s what caused the grand mal seizure?” I asked.
“Yeah.
It’s bad.” He picked up the phone on the desk and called the OR. “This is Dr.
Finn. I need an OR prepped now. I’m bringing up a patient with a serious brain
bleed.”
“Let’s
get her out of there and get her prepped.”
“Could
it have been going on for the past couple of months?” I asked.
“It’s
very likely it started off extremely slow.”
“But
her last scans didn’t show a brain bleed,” I spoke.
“Sometimes
if the bleed is small enough, it won’t show up, which I believe happened here.
There’s no way we could have known this was going to happen.”
“I
want to scrub in.”
“No.
What I need is for you to go home. You need to go home, Grace.”
“What
I need is to be in surgery,” I spoke in an angry tone.
He
stood there for a moment and stared in my eyes with a disapproving look.
“Fine.
You can scrub in on one condition.”
“And
what’s that?” I cocked my head.
“After
Justine’s surgery, I’m driving you home. I don’t want you driving. Deal?”
“Fine.”
I rolled my eyes.
Jamieson
and I were in the middle of stopping Justine’s brain bleed, when one of my
residents walked into the OR.
“Excuse
me, Dr. Harper. Dr. Sinclair wants to see you the minute you’re done with your
surgery.”
“Tell
her that I’ll talk to her first thing tomorrow morning.”
“She
told me that you’d probably say that, and she said you are to be in her office
the second you get out of surgery.”
I
sighed, and Jamieson glanced over at me.
“Don’t
mess with Mama Bear. I’m almost finished. You can go now.”
“No. I
can help you finish.”
“Dr.
Harper, I’m going to put this as nicely as I can. Get out of my OR. Go talk to
Renata and then we’ll go home.”
I
scrubbed out and headed to Renata’s office.
“You
wanted to see me?”
“You’re
damn right I do. What the hell were you thinking, Grace?” she spoke in a stern
voice. “What would have happened if that man would have shot you?”
“But
he didn’t.”
“But
he could have!” she shouted. “You are to see Dr. Parker first thing tomorrow morning.
I already called and told him you’d be coming.”
“Renata—”
“No,
Grace.” She pointed her finger at me. “It is not up for discussion. You know
the protocol. You are not to see or treat any patients until you talk to him.”
“Fine.
I’ll see him in the morning. May I leave now?”
“You
better be going home. In fact, I’m sending you home.”
“I am
going home.”
She
walked over and hugged me.
“Don’t
ever do that again. That was a foolish stunt.”
I
walked out of her office and found Jamieson standing outside the door, holding
my things.
“I
went to your locker and grabbed your things. Are you ready?”
“Yeah.
I’m ready. And if you don’t mind, I don’t want to talk.”
“Okay,”
he spoke.
****
Jamieson
As I
stood there in the middle of the ER and listened to Grace tell that man to
shoot her, a feeling like I’d never felt before washed over me. My first
instinct was to protect her, but I couldn’t. That man was unstable. One wrong
move, and he could have shot her. Everything she said to him hit me hard. It
all made sense now. Every goddamn thing about her and moving back to Los
Angeles now made sense.
I
glanced over at her as I drove us home. She was tired and sad but still as
beautiful as ever. After the incident, I understood why she needed to be a part
of my surgery. It was her comfort zone. A place where she could forget about
everyone and everything except the patient. I did the same thing. As surgeons,
the OR is our escape, our safe haven, our drug and our high. A place where we
can clean up the messes of other people’s lives just to forget how fucked up
ours were.
I
pulled into the driveway and Grace climbed out of the car. I inserted my key
into the lock and opened the door. While I was disarming the alarm, Grace
walked upstairs without so much as a word. I was worried about her. She needed
to talk about what happened, but she wanted her space. And no matter how much I
didn’t want to give it to her, I had no choice. My phone rang, and it was my
resident giving me an update on two of my patients. After I was done with the call,
I poured myself a scotch and took it up to the rooftop. It was a cooler than
usual night, and when I looked out onto the beach, I saw Grace sitting in the
sand. Fuck it. I went to my bedroom, grabbed a blanket, and took it down to her.
“Hey,”
I softly spoke as I wrapped the blanket around her. “It’s a little chilly out
here.”
“Thank
you.”
“You’re
welcome. I’m going to go back inside.”
“Good
idea,” she spoke as she stared at the ocean.
I
began to walk away and then stopped. Clenching my fist, I tried to control the
anger I felt inside, but I couldn’t.
“No!
It’s not a good idea. What you did was stupid! You told a man to shoot you!
What the fuck, Grace? Do you have any idea how scared I was that he was going
to take you up on your offer? Damn it!” I ran my hands through my hair as I
stared at her. “You had a gun pointed at you. You’re not okay!”







Chapter Thirty-Four

Grace
The
night air was cool as I walked down to the beach and nestled myself in the
sand. The ocean roared as the waves crashed against the shore. Silver sequin
stars scattered themselves across the sky and the low waning moon shined
brightly amongst them. I was thankful for the blanket Jamieson brought me as I
held it tightly around me. As I sat there and listened to him rant about the incident
at the hospital, a part of me wanted to scream at him to go away, but the other
part of me realized that he cared enough to voice his opinion.
“Aren’t
you going to say anything?” he yelled.
“I
will once you calm yourself down,” I softly spoke. “Just sit down, shut up, and
I’ll talk.”
He sat
down in the sand next to me and brought his knees up to his chest.
“I’m
listening,” he spoke.
“It
was nine thirty p.m. and we were on our way home from the Santa Monica Pier.
That’s where I wanted to go for my birthday. We spent a few hours there,
walking around, riding the rides and eating all kinds of junk food. The minute
we got in the car, it started to pour rain. My mom told my dad to wait until it
let up, but he said, ‘We’ll be fine. We need to get our birthday princess home.
She had a long day.’ We were driving down a two-way road. I remember sitting in
the back seat watching the windshield wipers go back and forth as fast as they
could trying to clear the rain from the window. My mom was telling my dad to pull
over because he was having trouble seeing the road and she was scared. So he
did. I told my parents that I wanted to go home, and my dad turned around,
smiled, and said as soon as God was finished watering the land, we would. My
mom reached over to take off her seatbelt because she needed to get something
from her purse that was on the floor. It was hard enough for her to bend over
as it was because she was eight months pregnant. My father told her to stay
buckled and that he would get it for her, so he took off his seatbelt, and when
he reached down to get her purse, there was a crash from behind. A force so
hard that it flipped our car.
“I
screamed as we rolled, and I shut my eyes as tight as I could. Then the car
suddenly stopped as soon as we hit a tree. I opened my eyes, and at first,
everything was blurry. But soon enough, I regained focus and realized the car
was upside-down. I looked in the front seat, the windshield was shattered, and
my dad wasn’t there, but my mom was. I called her name over and over again, but
she wouldn’t answer. I unbuckled my seat belt and carefully climbed out the
back window that was shattered. I ran over to my mom’s side and got down on the
ground. Her arm was hanging out the window, so I felt for a pulse and she was
still alive. I tried to wake her. I begged her to wake up, and finally, she
opened her eyes. She looked at me weakly as blood was running down her face.
“‘Grace,
where’s Daddy?’ she asked in a panicked tone.
“‘I
don’t know. He’s not in the car,’ I cried.
“‘I need
you to go find him and make sure he’s okay. Help will be here soon. Go, Grace.
Go find Daddy. I’ll be okay.’
“‘No,
Mom, I can’t leave you,’ I cried.
“‘I’m
fine here. Your daddy might need help. Go, Grace. Go now. Everything’s going to
be okay,’ she spoke as the tears flowed from her eyes.
“I
stood up and looked around and that’s when I saw him lying on the ground a few
feet away from the car. I ran over to him just as another car pulled over and a
man got out asking if we were okay. He said he called 911 and that an ambulance
was on its way. I looked down at my dad, who was lying unconscious with a
gaping wound in his abdomen and blood pouring out of it. I remembered the ABCs.
Airway, Breathing, Circulatory/stop the bleeding. He wasn’t breathing, so I did
CPR and he regained consciousness. The man who called 911 ran over to me and
asked if I was okay as he stared down at my dad. I yelled at him to help my
mom. I looked at my dad’s abdomen and knew I had to try and stop the bleeding.
I had a zip-up hoodie on over my shirt, so I took it off and applied pressure
to the wound with it. I knew if I moved, he would bleed out and die.”
“How
did you know to do that? You were only ten years old,” Jamieson asked.
“I remembered
reading about it in one of my parents’ medical books. Two ambulances pulled up
and the paramedics ran over to me and my dad and another one to my mom. I told
them I performed CPR and that he was bleeding out from his abdomen. They told
me to let go and they would take over, but I couldn’t. I refused, and I
screamed and cried until they listened. So one of the paramedics placed his
hand over mine and kept it there all the way to Cedars-Sinai. My dad kept
telling me not to be afraid and that he was going to be okay. But I knew he
wouldn’t be. Don’t ask me how I knew. I just did. He kept telling me how brave
I was and how proud he was of me. When we arrived at the hospital, Renata was
there. She was a fifth-year resident on call that night. Not too long after my
dad was taken inside, the other ambulance with my mom pulled up. I stood in the
hallway, my clothes and my hands covered in blood, outside both of their trauma
rooms as the doctors and nurses scurried to save them. They called time of
death on my mom first. My body went numb. I looked over to where my dad was,
and he had just coded. I stood there and begged them not to let my dad die. The
doctor tried for twenty minutes to bring him back, but he couldn’t. So he
called time of death. It was in that moment, that very moment, when both my
parents passed away, I knew I wanted to be a trauma surgeon. Renata took me to
the bathroom and cleaned me up. She told me that I was so brave for doing what
I did for my dad and that I’d make a great doctor someday.”
“My God,
Grace.” Jamieson reached over and placed his hand on mine. “I can’t even
imagine what you went through. You were just a child.”
“You
had asked me once why I chose trauma. Now you know the reason why. I wanted to
save lives. I didn’t want anyone else to feel what I felt that night.”
“That’s
why you did what you did for that little girl’s father that day,” Jamieson
spoke. “She reminded you of yourself. That’s why you fought so hard to save
him.”
“Yes.
All the memories of that night came flooding back and I wasn’t about to let her
lose two parents like I did.”
“And
you calling out time of death in your sleep. That wasn’t from all the times you
called it on your patients. It was the memory of your parents and that night.”
“I
hadn’t had that dream in many years until I came back to Los Angeles. I should
have died with my parents that night, but I wasn’t even hurt. I didn’t have a
scratch on me.”
He
wrapped his arm around me, pulled me into him, and softly pressed his lips
against the top of my head.
“When
Mr. Samson came in with that gun, I wasn’t about to let him hurt anyone.”
“Why
did you come back here, Grace?” he asked.
“It
was time. Time to face it all and put it to rest. Sam gave me the reason to do
it.”
“Did
you truly and honestly love him?” he asked.
“My
Aunt Cora said I didn’t, but I thought I did. He was the only guy that stuck around
with my hectic schedule. He understood and never got mad when I had to cancel
dates because I was either on call or in surgery. Being a trauma surgeon in the
ER isn’t flexible. He told me he’d always wait for me.”
“And you
never suspected once he was married?”
“No.
Because I was too wrapped up in the thought that he loved me enough to put up
with my work. No other man could or would. He worked on Wall Street and had an
apartment on the Upper West Side. He was there Monday through Friday, but on
weekends, he would go to his Connecticut home, which he told me was where his
mother who had Alzheimer’s lived and was being taken care of by a homecare
nurse. He would go there on the weekends and take care of her. Little did I know
it was all a lie.”
“And
he never took you to meet his mother?”
“No.
He said she was so far gone and living in the past that she didn’t even know
who he was, so there was no point for me to meet her.”
“How
did you find out he was married?”
“He
had spent the night at my place, and I had just gotten home from the hospital
around two a.m. His coat was lying on the chair and I heard his phone going off.
So I went in his pocket and took it out to see if it was an emergency. Except
it wasn’t the phone that he used when he was with me. It was a different phone.
Someone named Rachel kept calling and I just knew something wasn’t right, so I
took the phone in the bedroom, woke him up, and told him that Rachel was
calling him. When he looked at me, all I could see was the fear in his eyes. I
wouldn’t give him the phone until he told me who Rachel was, and if he didn’t,
I would answer it myself. He panicked and started yelling at me, saying if she
was calling in the middle of the night, it had to be an emergency and to give
him the phone. So I handed it to him and he answered it. He jumped out of bed
and got dressed. He told me that Rachel was his wife and that his daughter was
rushed to the hospital with severe stomach pains and that her appendix
ruptured, and he had to drive home to Connecticut. Then he walked out and left
me standing there in total shock. A few days later, he came back, and I let him
explain himself because I wanted to know how the fuck I was so stupid and
didn’t know. He begged and pleaded for me to forgive him and that he was going
to tell his wife everything and divorce her. He said that he wasn’t in love
with her anymore and he only wanted me. I knew he was lying, and I knew I
needed to get out of this situation and make a plan. So, I told him to give me
two months to process everything and to think about it and think about us. I
told him that if he truly loved me, he would respect my wishes. I needed the
time to prepare, and that’s what I did. I called Renata and she hired me on the
spot. I gave notice to my apartment, made living arrangements here, and little
by little, packed everything up.”
“Wow.
What a total douchebag. I’m sorry he did that to you.”
“Me
too. I was so angry at him for deceiving me the way he did. But you know what
the worst part was?” I lifted my head from his shoulder.
“What?”
“I
wished he was dead. I save people’s lives for a living, but I wished he was
dead for what he did to me.”
“It’s
understandable, Grace. The man lived a double life for over a year. He hurt you
in a really bad way.” He placed his hand on my cheek. “But you need to put all
that behind you. You’re a survivor and you’re strong.”
My
eyes stared into his as I took the blanket off me and wrapped it around the
both of us. I was swept up in the moment. Swept up in his concern for me and
his gentleness. As much as I hated to admit it, I needed him. I didn’t want to
need him, but it was something I couldn’t control. I placed my hand over his,
which was still resting on my cheek, and tilted my head.
“Is it
okay if I kiss you?” he whispered.
“Yes,”
I replied.







Chapter Thirty-Five

Jamieson
I
leaned in and let my lips softly brush against hers. No matter how bad I wanted
to, I wasn’t rushing it because chances were that she’d leave me with a bad
case of blue balls.
“Really?”
She pulled back.
The
corners of my mouth curved upwards. 
“I’m
not getting all worked up only for you to tell me no.”
“I’m
not saying no. I’m saying yes.” She smiled as she pulled the blanket tightly
around us.
“Okay,
then.”
My
mouth smashed into hers and our lips tangled beneath the moonlight.
“I
think we better get inside,” I spoke.
“Yeah.”
She smiled as she placed her forehead against mine. “I think we better.”
I
swooped her up in my arms and carried her back to the house. My cock was hard
and throbbing to be buried deep inside her. The bedroom was too far away, and I
couldn’t wait anymore, so I set her down in the kitchen as our lips stayed
locked while we quickly removed our clothes and then made it to the living room
couch. She pushed me back into a sitting position and climbed on top of me,
taking my cock inside her inch by inch. My hands roamed her breasts as our
tongues danced to the rhythm of our beating hearts. Sounds of ecstasy escaped
her as her body tightened and she came. I threw my head back as I held down her
hips and exploded inside of her. She rested her forehead against mine and we
stayed locked together for a few moments while we regained our breath. She
climbed off me, grabbed her clothes from the floor, and headed towards the
stairs.
“What
are you doing?” I asked.
“Going
to bed. I’m exhausted. Good night.”
“Good
night? Really?”
I sat
there in confusion as I watched her naked body go up the stairs. Sighing, I got
up from the couch, pulled on my underwear, grabbed my clothes, and went up to
my room. I paced back and forth a few times before I finally walked down the
hallway and knocked on her door.
“Come
in,” she spoke.
I
walked over to the bed, grabbed her hand, and pulled her up.
“Umm.
What are you doing?”
“You’ll
see. Come with me.” I pulled her behind me.
“Jamieson,”
she spoke.
I led
her to my room, pulled the covers back from the other side of the bed, and told
her to get in.
“You’re
sleeping with me tonight. Understand?” I spoke in a stern tone.
“Okay.
Fine. I’ll sleep in your bed.”
We
both climbed under the covers and she rolled the other way.
“Head
on my chest, now!”
She
turned and looked at me with a strange look across her beautiful face.
“I
said now,” I softly spoke.
She
snuggled against me as my arm wrapped around her and her head rested on my
chest.
“What
has gotten into you?” she asked.
I
swallowed hard.
“Nothing.
I just think after everything that happened today, you shouldn’t be alone.”
“Well,
thank you for your concern, but I’m okay.”
“Grace,
you told a man to shoot you. You’re far from okay.” I kissed the top of her
head. “Good night.”
“Good
night, Jamieson.”
I was
a surgeon. I healed people, and for some goddamn reason, I wanted to heal her.
The only problem was that I only had room in my life to try and heal someone
else. I needed to fight everything I felt for Grace, and I tried. I tried so
hard that it became exhausting. She wasn’t like any other woman I’d ever been
with, and I damn well knew it back in New York that first night we met. But it
didn’t matter then because I was never supposed to see her again. She stirred
and started calling out “time of death.” I tightened my grip around her and
pressed my lips against the top of her head.
“Shh,”
I whispered. “You’re safe now.”
****
Grace
Before
the alarm went off, Jamieson’s pager started buzzing. As he went to grab it
from his nightstand, I rolled out from under his arm and onto my side.
“I
have to get to the hospital, which means you have to come with me since I’m
your ride in.”
“Shit,”
I moaned. “What time is it?”
“Five
fifteen.”
He
climbed out of bed and went into the bathroom. I lay there for a moment and
thought about now what. Last night had been different between us. Different
than it ever had been. I couldn’t explain it, but I felt like it was the start
of something and it freaked me out. I still didn’t know anything about him. For
fuck sakes, I was married to the man and knew absolutely nothing about his
family. Except for his father, whom he had no qualms about telling me he didn’t
like.
I
climbed out of bed and went into my bathroom. I put a shower cap on my head and
took a quick shower to wash my body.
“You
better be ready in like five minutes. I have to go,” Jamieson shouted from the
hallway.
Rolling
my eyes, I threw on some clothes, ran a brush through my hair, and grabbed my
makeup. On the way there, neither one of us spoke about last night. He pulled
into the parking lot, parked the car, and we both headed into the hospital.
“Good
morning, Grace,” Jackie spoke. “Why are you here so early?”
“Jamieson
drove me home last night and he got paged, so I had to come in with him. I’ll
be in the attendings’ lounge. I can’t treat any patients until I see Dr.
Parker.” I rolled my eyes.
I had
my appointment with Dr. Parker and he cleared me to treat patients, but on the
condition that I see him once a week. I accepted and scheduled my appointments
for the next month. As soon as I went down to the ER, the paramedics were
bringing in a patient.
“I got
this one, Jackie,” I spoke as I met the paramedics at the door. “What do we have?”
I asked.
“Jane
Doe, approximately mid to late fifties. Was found wandering the streets
screaming out something about aliens coming for her. She’s highly agitated.”
“Take
her to room two. Is she homeless?” I asked as I looked her over.
“I
have no clue, Dr. Harper. Someone called and said she was displaying erratic
behavior. She tried to fight us, so we had no choice but to restrain her.”
“Ma’am.
Can you tell me your name?” I asked in a soft voice as not to frighten her.
“I
have to get out of here. They’re coming for me and my son. I need to protect
him.” She tried to get out of the restraints.
“Who’s
coming for you and your son?”
“The aliens.
They’re looking for us. They want to hurt us. I need to protect my boy.”
“Sara,
I need a tox screen, glucose, and electrolytes, stat. Ma’am, can you tell me
your name?” I asked.
“No.
If I tell you, you’ll tell them, and then they’ll find me,” she spoke in a
panicked voice.
“She’s
psychotic. Page psych for a consult,” I spoke to Sara.
“It’s
not safe here. I need to leave and go somewhere safe. I need to protect my
son.”
“My
name is Dr. Harper and I promise I’m going to protect you.” I smiled.
“You
can’t. This place isn’t safe. They’ll come for you too.”
“It is
safe.” I placed my hand on her arm. “The aliens can’t get in here. We have a
special barrier they can’t break through. You’re safe here.”
My
Jane Doe was dirty. Her hair was a mess and it looked like she hadn’t showered
in days.
“Where
is psych?” I asked.
“He’s
with another consult. He said he’ll be down as soon as he’s finished,” Sara
spoke.
“I need
to find my son, Jamie,” she spoke. “I need to protect him. He needs me.”
She
began to become even more hysterical, screaming and trying her hardest to get
out of the restraints.
“Push
two milligrams of Lorazepam with five milligrams of Haloperidol,” I spoke.
“You
don’t want to wait for psych to get down here?” Sara asked.
“It’s
taking too long, and this poor woman needs some relief.”
I
walked out of the room and over to the nurses’ station while I finished
documenting everything in her chart. Suddenly, something hit me like a ton of
bricks. I ran back into the room and stood over her.
“Ma’am,
is your son’s name Jamieson by any chance?”
“Yes.
Jamie. Did you find him?” she asked in a calm state.
“I’m
going to look for him now.” I gently smiled.
My
heart was racing a mile a minute. I pulled out my phone and sent him a text
message.
“Where are you?”
“In my office. Why?”
“I’m coming up there. I need to
talk to you.”
I took
the elevator up to his office and I prayed to God I was right about this.
Lightly knocking on his office door, he told me to come in.
“What’s
up?” he spoke as he stared at his computer.
Oh my God,
I didn’t know how to ask him. I took in a deep breath as fear filled me.
“Your
research for schizophrenia.” 
“What
about it?” He glanced at me.
“Is it
because of your mother?” I blurted out.
“Why
the hell are you asking me that?” He stood up from his chair as anger washed
over him.
“There’s
a woman down in the ER and she’s psychotic. She keeps saying that she needs to
find her son Jamie.”
He
tore past me out of his office and ran to the elevator. I ran after him.
“Jamieson.”
“What
room?” he asked.
“Two.
Room two. We had to restrain her. She was highly agitated and talking about aliens
coming after her.”
“Did
you give her anything?” he asked in anger.
“Two
milligrams of Lorazepam with five milligrams of Haloperidol,” I spoke.
The
elevator doors opened, and he quickly ran to room two. I followed behind.
“Everyone
out!” he shouted. “Including you.” He looked at me.
“She’s
my patient,” I shouted back.
“I
don’t give a fuck. Get out of here!”
I left
the room and Jackie looked at me.
“You
okay?” she asked as she placed her hand on my shoulder.
“I’m
fine.”
“Dr.
Harper, you needed a psych consult?” Dr. Parker asked.
“Room
two. Dr. Finn is in there right now. I would proceed with caution if I were
you.”
“You
called neuro?” he asked.
“He
knows her,” I spoke as I walked away.







Chapter Thirty-Six

Grace
I went
up to the rooftop and grabbed a cup of coffee. The look on Jamieson’s face when
I spoke about his mother was the same look that night he knocked over the glass
and I cut my arm. It frightened me. I now understood why he was so angry and would
never talk about her. She was a schizophrenic. But it didn’t give him the right
to go on the rampages he did. The way he screamed at me to get out of the room
was the last straw. He was hot and cold, and when he was cold, it was
unbearable. I had never had anyone treat me the way he did. One minute, he was
kind, caring, and almost human. The next, he was rude, arrogant, and a bastard.
Sam may have lied to me in the worst way possible, but he only once ever raised
his voice to me. The night I found out he was married.
“There
you are,” Renata spoke as she walked up behind me. “I heard about Jamieson’s
mother, and I also heard about how he screamed at everyone down there,
including you.”
“Did
you know about her?” I asked.
“I
did. Jamieson confided in me when he approached me about the grant for the
research he wanted to do. I had never met her, though. I don’t think he’s seen
her in a few years.”
“It
doesn’t give him the right to treat people the way he does,” I spoke.
“I
know.” She sighed. “I’m sorry you got involved with him, Grace. I did warn you,
though.”
“You
sure did.”
“Anyway,
his mother has been admitted to the psychiatric ward until we can get her meds
regulated,” she spoke.
“So
it’s safe to go back down to the ER?”
“It’s
safe. You still have to go home to him tonight.”
“I’m
not going home. I’m staying here tonight. He needs his space and I’m sure I’m
the last person he wants to see.”
She
placed her hand on my shoulder.
“You
just may be the only person he wants and needs to see.”
****
Jamieson
After
checking on my mom, I went home for the evening. I pulled into the driveway and
let out a deep breath when I saw that Grace’s car wasn’t there. I didn’t want
to deal with her tonight and I didn’t want to talk about anything. I went
inside, poured myself a scotch, grabbed my laptop, and sat down on the couch.
My mother went off her meds and who the hell knew where she’d been the last five
years. But this was nothing new. She’d been doing this shit since I was eight years
old.
A few
hours had passed, and Grace still wasn’t home. I turned everything off and
headed upstairs to bed. I woke up around three a.m. Climbing out of bed, I went
down to the kitchen for a bottle of water. On my way back up, I stopped outside
her room and slowly opened her door. Her bed was empty and still perfectly
made. I sighed and went back to bed.
The
next morning, shortly after I arrived at the hospital, I was paged down to the
ER for a consult.
“Let’s
get her upstairs for a head CT,” I spoke.
After
leaving the patient’s room, I walked over to the nurses’ station and Grace was
standing there.
“You
didn’t come home last night,” I spoke.
“I was
tied up in surgery and I didn’t want to drive home that late.”
“I
see. So you slept in the on-call room?”
“Yeah,
I did.” She looked at me and walked away.
I
glanced at Jackie, who was staring at me with her lips pressed together.
“What?”
I asked.
“Nothing.”
She arched her brow.
I went
up to my mother’s room and found she was awake. Her meds were kicking in and
she seemed to be in a normal state.
“Hi,
Mom.” I smiled as I walked inside and grabbed hold of her hand.
“Jamie.
My sweet boy. Thank you for coming to visit me.” 
“How
long have you been off your meds?” I asked.
“I
don’t know. It’s been a long time. I couldn’t afford them anymore.”
“Mom,
why didn’t you call me or come back? I would have helped you.”
“I’ve
been such a burden to you since you were a little boy.” She placed her hand on
my cheek. “You have a beautiful life and you don’t need me screwing it up. Tell
me what’s been going on. Is there a woman in your life?”
“No.”
There
was no way in hell I was telling her about Grace and what happened.
“Why
not? You’re such a handsome and successful young man.”
“My
work is my number one priority, Mom. It always has been.”
“Jamie,
don’t do that. How about that young doctor who was with me yesterday?”
“Who?”
I asked, knowing she was talking about Grace.
“She
was blonde, very pretty, and so kind. I can’t remember her name.”
“Dr.
Harper?” I asked.
“Possibly.
I was hoping you could find her and ask her to come see me.”
“She’s
a trauma surgeon, Mom.”
“I
still would like to see her. Please, Jamie.”
“I’ll
see if she’s available. In the meantime, I’m going to order a head CT.”
“Why?”
“I
just want to make sure everything’s okay.”
“You already
know I’m not okay.” She lightly smiled.
“I’m
ordering it anyway. I’m going to find a cure for you,” I spoke as I squeezed
her hand.
“I
know you will, Jamie. You’re so highly intelligent. Use some of that
intelligence to find someone to love and to share your life with. All I want is
for you to be happy.”
“I am
happy, Mom. Especially now that you’re back.”
My
pager went off, and I was needed for a consult.
“I
have to go. I’m needed in the ER.”
I
kissed her forehead and then walked out.
“You
paged me?” I asked Grace as I walked into the room.
“Twenty-one-year-old
male with a gunshot wound to the right upper quadrant and no reflexes,” she spoke
as she was in the middle of doing an ultrasound.
“The
bullet must have penetrated his spinal cord,” I spoke.
“I
need to get him up to the OR for a laparotomy. His abdomen is filling with
blood,” Grace spoke.
“I’m
scrubbing in.”
“Is
that really necessary?” she asked.
“I
just told you that the bullet may have penetrated his spine. So yes, it is
necessary. Are you making this personal, Dr. Harper?” I spoke in a harsh tone.
“No.
And how dare you insinuate that.” She cocked her head.
“Let’s
get him up to the OR, then.”
Grace
and I entered the scrub room and began scrubbing in.
“My
mother wanted me to tell you that she would like for you to come see her,” I
spoke.
“Why?”
“I
don’t know. She said you were nice to her, so she probably wants to thank you
or something.”
“Did
you tell her about us?”
“There
is no us and, no, I didn’t. I expect you to do the same,” I spoke deadpan.
“Trust
me. You don’t have to worry about that.”
She
walked into the OR first and I followed.
“Dr.
Harper, I need to get to his spine immediately or he may never walk again.”
“If I
don’t find out where this bleed is coming from, you won’t have to worry about
it because he’ll bleed out and die. I’m doing the best I can, Dr. Finn.”
I
didn’t like her attitude and I didn’t need it. Grace stopped the bleeding and I
was able to remove the bullet that was lodged in his spine. We both scrubbed
out and didn’t say a word to each other.
 







Chapter Thirty-Seven

Grace
“Asshole,”
I mumbled to myself as I walked out of the scrub room.
I’d
swear that man was bi-polar. I went up to visit his mom, and when I looked
through the window to the room she was in, I saw she was sleeping. I went back
down to the ER and Jackie asked me to join her for lunch. I was starving, and
the ER was quiet for now.
“I
seriously don’t think I can go home again tonight,” I spoke to her as we sat
down in the cafeteria. “That man is unbearable.”
“Don’t
let him keep you from your bed, Grace. Fuck Dr. Finn. Not literally, but you
know what I mean.” She smirked. “That is your home too for the next six months.
Don’t let him drive you out. Don’t give him that kind of power. If you really
want to piss him off, rearrange his things.” She laughed. “Make a mess. He
can’t kick you out. Make his home your home.” She pointed at me with her fork.
“I know you got it in you, girl!”
“Since
I’ve been there, I’ve felt like I’ve been walking on eggshells because I know
he doesn’t want me there. Hell, I don’t want to be there. But it is nice being
on the beach.”
“Then
stop walking on eggshells.”
“You
know what? Maybe you’re right. His problems aren’t mine. I told him everything
about me. My parents’ death, Sam, everything. I never talked about what
happened that night of the car accident to anyone. Not even Sam. But I told
Jamieson, and for one night, he was so amazingly sweet. There is another side
to him. A side he doesn’t let anyone see. Ever since his mother was admitted, he’s
become so angry. I thought maybe things with him were starting to turn around
after that night. But since his mother arrived and I treated her, it’s like he
hates me even more now.”
“I
don’t think he hates you, Grace. I think he’s probably embarrassed.”
“Maybe,
but it doesn’t give him the right to act like an asshole. I’m so over it.”
“Good.
Does that mean you’re sleeping at home tonight?” she asked.
“Damn
right it does.” I smiled.
My shift
ended, so before going home, I stopped at a Thai place and picked up some
dinner. As soon as I pulled into the driveway, I let out a breath and thanked
God that Jamieson wasn’t home. With any luck, he’d get a surgery and be tied up
for hours.
I was
sitting at the kitchen table eating my Pad Thai when I heard the door open.
Shit. Jamieson walked into the kitchen and set a plastic bag down on the
counter.
“I
didn’t think you’d be home,” he spoke.
“Sorry
to disappoint you,” I said.
He
didn’t respond. He reached up into the cabinet and pulled down a plate. After
putting his food on it, he brought it over to the table and sat down. I grabbed
my plate, took it over to the sink, and then started to walk out of the
kitchen.
“Aren’t
you going to put your plate in the dishwasher?” he asked.
“I
will tomorrow,” I spoke as I walked away and went up to my room.
I
changed into my pajamas, climbed in bed, and turned on the TV. As I was lying
there watching some Lifetime movie about a wife who murders her husband, there was
a knock on my door.
“What?”
“Can I
come in for a second?” Jamieson asked.
“I
guess.”
The
door opened, and Jamieson stood there with his hand on the handle.
“I
scheduled Justin’s surgery for the day after tomorrow. He’s being admitted in
the morning for some pre-op bloodwork and another CT scan. I put your name up
on the surgical board, so make sure the ER is covered.”
“I’ll
let Jackie know,” I spoke.
“By
the way, I put your plate in the dishwasher.”
I gave
him a fake smile before he shut the door. The next morning, I got up, got
dressed, and went downstairs. I made enough coffee for one cup. Then I toasted
a bagel, spread some cream cheese on it, and sat down at the island to eat before
heading to the hospital. As I was sitting there, Jamieson walked into the kitchen.
He walked over to the coffee pot and the first thing my eyes diverted to was
his perfect ass in his tight black pants. Shit. He held up the coffee pot and
looked at me.
“You
drank all the coffee?” he asked.
“I
made myself a cup.”
“Really?”
His eye narrowed at me. “You couldn’t make a few cups?”
“No.”
I took a bite of my bagel.
He
shook his head as he made himself some.
“That’s
really immature, Grace.”
“Apparently,
I’m an immature person.” I took another bite of my bagel.
“What
is the matter with you?” he asked. “Oh, that’s right. You’re a woman. You’re
all bat shit crazy.”
I
swallowed hard to control the anger that rose inside me.
“Did
you ever stop to think that you’re the reason women around you are bat shit
crazy? Oh wait, that’s right. You’re a man and you’re never ever wrong. You’re
perfect. You live in your perfect little beach house, work your perfect little
job, and treat perfectly good women with no respect in your perfect little
way.”
“You
really want to do this now?” His brow arched.
“Do
what? Have a perfect little argument? No. I don’t. You aren’t worth arguing
with,” I spoke in a stern tone as I grabbed my purse.
“You
have made my life a living hell!” he shouted in anger.
“You
make your own life a living hell, Jamieson. Stop blaming everyone else and own
it!”
I took
in a deep breath as I watched the anger tear through his body. He was a ticking
time bomb and I was afraid I just set him to explode. He stood there and stared
at me, then grabbed his keys off the counter and walked out of the house. If I
could only get him to open up to me, things would be different. I didn’t know
how much longer I could live like this.
I
arrived at the hospital a few minutes late.
“There
you are,” Jackie spoke.
“Sorry
I’m late. Jamieson and I got into a fight this morning.”
“Over
what?”
“I
made one cup of coffee for me and he called me immature.”
Jackie
snickered.
“And
then it escalated from there,” I spoke. “I really hope I don’t have to see him
the rest of the day.”
“Then
let’s pray nobody comes into the ER and needs a neuro consult.” She put her arm
around me.







Chapter Thirty-Eight

Jamieson
I went
up to my mother’s room and she wasn’t in there.
“Kevin,
where is my mother?” I asked.
“She
left.”
“What?
What do you mean she left?” I shouted.
“She
discharged herself and wanted me to give this to you.”
He
handed me a white envelope with my name on it. I took it from him, went down to
my office, and opened it. Inside was a folded piece of paper with my mother’s
writing on it. I leaned back in my chair and read it.
My dearest son,
It was so good to see you again.
I’ve missed you so much, and as hard as it is, I must go. I know you will never
understand, but it’s something I must do. I just hope you can forgive me. You
have made me so very proud and I love you. Never forget that. I have my
medication and I intend to get my life in order, but I need to do it alone. Be
happy, Jamie. That’s all I want for you. You’re a brilliant surgeon and man and
any woman would be lucky to be a part of your life. Until next time, my son. Love,
Mom.
My
eyes started to fill with tears, but I quickly stopped them as I threw the
letter on my desk. This wasn’t anything new. It was what she did. My pager went
off and I was needed down in the ER.
“You
paged?” I asked Grace.
“Thirty-year-old
male. MCC victim. He wasn’t wearing a helmet and has an open skull fracture.
The paramedics had to intubate him in the field. We’re waiting for his x-rays
now.”
“His
pupils are sluggish,” I spoke.
“His
abdominal ultrasound is clear,” Grace said.
“Dr.
Finn, here are his x-rays,” Sara spoke as she walked into the room.
“Shit,”
I spoke as I held them up and looked at them. “He needs to get in the OR now.”
“Grace,
there’s a trauma coming in five minutes out. It’s a child,” Jackie spoke as she
stuck her head in the room.
“Okay,”
she spoke and then looked at me.
“I got
this. If you need a neuro consult, page my resident.”
I
rushed him up to the OR and did everything I could, but it wasn’t enough.
“Time
of death, 14:05,” I sighed.
****
Grace
“Damn
it. I need more pads,” I spoke. “More suction, Dr. Lasher.”
“He’s
going into V-fib, Dr. Harper.”
“Start
CPR and get the paddles,” I spoke. “Charge to 150. Clear.” I stared at the
monitor. “Charge to 200. Clear. Damn it. Push Atropine now and charge to 200.
Clear.”
“Dr.
Harper,” Steve, the anesthesiologist, spoke.
I
stared into his eyes as he slowly shook his head. I swallowed hard as I looked
at the clock.
“Time
of death, 14:45.”
I
handed the paddles to Dr. Lasher and slowly walked out of the OR. I found the
nearest stairwell and leaned against the wall, sinking down until I was on the
ground. Tears started falling from my eyes as my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.
“Grace?”
Jamieson asked as he stood over me. “What happened?”
I
started to cry harder. Losing a child during surgery was the one thing I’d
never get over. It was also the one thing I couldn’t deal with. Jamieson sat
down next to me and grabbed hold of my hand.
“I
couldn’t save him. He was only seven years old. His injuries were too severe,
and he bled out and coded.”
“I’m
sorry.” He brought my hand up to his lips. “I know how hard it is. It’s bad
enough when they’re adults, but when they’re children, it’s far worse. Come
here.”
He let
go of my hand, wrapped his arm around me, and I laid my head on his shoulder.
“Have
you told the parents yet?”
“No,” I
cried. “God, I hate this.”
“If
you want, I’ll come with you and tell them.”
“Thanks,
but I have to do it.” I sniffled. 
I
lifted my head from his shoulder, took in a deep breath, and wiped away my
tears.
“How’s
your motorcycle crash guy?” I asked.
“He
didn’t make it. His intercranial bleed was too bad.”
“I’m
sorry.”
“The
guy should have been wearing a helmet,” he spoke.
I
stood up and wiped my eyes one last time.
“I
better go tell them,” I spoke.
“I’ll
come with you,” Jamieson said.
I gave
him a small smile before we left the stairwell and headed to the surgical
waiting room. I had forgotten about the fight we got into this morning. Once
again, he was there for me, even though I didn’t need him to be. I took in the
moment because I knew that once we got home, everything would go back to being total
hell.
****
Jamieson
The
moment I opened the door to the stairwell and saw Grace sitting on the floor
crying, I knew something bad had happened. As much as I was mad at her for this
morning, I wanted nothing more than to comfort her and take away her pain. I
hated the fact that I felt that way.
After
doing my final rounds, I went home, poured myself a drink, and sat on the
rooftop, listening to the waves as they crashed against the shore. I was happy
that Grace wasn’t home. I needed the silence, and I needed the peace.
“Hey,”
I heard Grace’s voice. “There you are. I went to visit your mom and they said
she was discharged.”
“Yeah.
She discharged herself. I came up here because I want to be alone.”
“Do
you know where she went?” she asked.
I
slowly closed my eyes before I unleashed my rage on her.
“What
fucking part of ‘I want to be alone’ do you not understand?” I shouted.
“I’m
sorry. I’ll get out of your way,” she spoke.







Chapter Thirty-Nine

Grace
That
was it. I’d had enough. I went to my room, grabbed my duffle bag from the
closet, and threw some clothes in it. I wasn’t staying here another night and I
didn’t care if I went to jail. Actually, jail would be a hell of a lot better
than living here. I climbed into my car and drove to the hospital. What I
wouldn’t give to be able to go back to my apartment. When I arrived, I went
into the on-call room and lay down on the bed. My stomach was growling because
I hadn’t eaten since lunch, so I got up, grabbed some money from my wallet, and
went to the vending machine.
“Dr.
Harper, I thought you went home,” Dr. Lasher spoke.
“You
mean Hell?” I shot her a look. “I’ll be in the on-call room if you need me.”
I put
some money into the machine and pushed the button for a turkey sandwich. After
I ate half of it, I laid down and closed my eyes.
“Dr.
Harper,” Dr. Lasher spoke as she opened the door. “Justin, your patient that’s
scheduled for surgery tomorrow, is vomiting and has a fever of 102.6.”
“Seriously?”
I sighed.
I got
up and took the elevator up to Justin’s room.
“Hey,
Justin. How are you feeling?” I asked as I looked over his chart.
“Not
good, Dr. Harper.”
“I
want you to repeat all the lab work and do a set of blood cultures. I suspect
it’s a virus, but it’s better to be safe,” I spoke to Dr. Lasher. “Don’t worry,
Justin, we’ll give you something for the vomiting. Dr. Lasher, can I see you in
the hall?”
She
followed me out of the room and we walked over to the nurses’ station.
“I
need you to call Dr. Finn and tell him about Justin’s condition. We’re going to
have to postpone the surgery.”
“Sure,
Dr. Harper.”
“You
know where to find me. And by the way, he’s in a mood, so good luck. Do not
under any circumstances tell him that I’m here. Understand me?”
“Yes,
Dr. Harper. Is everything okay?”
“It’s
Dr. Finn. Do you think everything is okay?” I arched my brow at her.
****
Jamieson
“Damn
it. I’ll check on him in the morning. If there’s any changes overnight, let me
know,” I spoke.
I
ended the call and sighed. I finished off the last of my drink and walked down
to Grace’s bedroom. I lightly knocked on the door and she didn’t answer, so I
placed my hand on the handle and opened the door, only to find her not there. I
went downstairs and checked the living room first, then the kitchen. It
appeared she wasn’t home. Where the hell did she go? I pulled my phone from my
pocket and dialed her. No answer. I sent her a text message.
“I don’t care where the hell you
are, but you need to call me. Justin is sick and we’re going to have to postpone
his surgery.”
I
waited for a response that never came. I fell asleep on the couch and woke up
at one a.m. I grabbed my phone from the coffee table and there was still no
message from Grace. On my way to bed, I opened the door to her room and she still
wasn’t home.
“Damn
you, Grace,” I spoke to myself.
Walking
back downstairs, I grabbed my keys, climbed into my car, and drove to the
hospital.
“Dr.
Finn, what are you doing here?” Dr. Lasher asked.
“Where
is she?”
“Who?”
“You
know who. Dr. Harper. And don’t lie to me,” I spoke in a stern voice.
“She’s
in the on-call room.”
I
opened the door and she wasn’t in there. When I turned around, I saw her
walking down the hallway.
“Jamieson,
what are you doing here?” she asked with aggravation.
“Looking
for you. What are you doing here?”
She
walked in the room and I followed behind, taking note of her duffel bag that
was sitting on the desk.
“Why
the hell did you pack a bag? Are you planning on living in the hospital?”
“You
know what? I’m tired. Go home,” she spoke. “You made it very clear you wanted
to be alone, so that’s what I’m giving you.”
“I
didn’t mean for you to leave. Damn it, Grace. Stop playing the martyr.”
“Me?”
she spoke in a loud tone as she pointed to herself. “You’re the one who’s
playing the martyr, Jamieson. Do you know what’s it like living with you?
You’re a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. One minute, you’re all sweet and kind and act
like you care, and the next, you’re the fucking devil. You’re rude, arrogant,
and just plain mean. So get the hell out of here and leave me alone!” she
shouted.
I
stood there and stared into her eyes, which were filled with anger. I’d seen
her angry before, but never like this. It hurt me to think I made her like
that. I couldn’t do this anymore. I couldn’t fight, and I knew I had to put a
stop to it.
“Grace—”
I calmly spoke.
“Don’t.”
She pointed at me.
I
walked over to where she stood and wrapped my arms around her. She tried to
fight me, but I wouldn’t let her out of my tight grip.
“I’m
sorry,” I spoke.
“You’re
always sorry, Jamieson.”
“I’m
an asshole. I admit it. Hate me. I deserve it. But I’m hoping you’ll give me a
chance to make things right. I care about you. More so than I’ve ever cared
about anyone. For the first time in my life, I’m ready to talk about my past
and my family. I want to tell you everything. You’re my wife for the next six
months and you have the right to know.”
She
broke out of my loosened grip and took hold of my hand as we both sat down on
the bed. She tightened her grip as I started telling her my story.







Chapter Forty

Jamieson
“My
mother was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic when I was eight years old. It
began when she started taking me to remote cabins in the middle of nowhere to
hide.”
“Hide
from what?” Grace asked.
“Anything
and everything. Aliens, the government, but mainly my father. She was convinced
they were trying to kill her and me. We stayed there for days until my father
found us. I wasn’t allowed to go outside because of her paranoia. The last time
she had taken me away was when it got really bad. She would lie in her bed and
scream all night long. She told me that the aliens took her in the middle of
the night and injected worms inside her. She would scratch her arms so
violently that she broke the skin in several places. I couldn’t take it anymore,
so when she was asleep, I found her keys that she had hidden, unlocked the door,
and ran for help. After about two miles, I stumbled across a small family-owned
general store. They called the police and an ambulance, and she was taken to
the hospital. But even before all that, she was behaving strangely. I would sit
at the top of the steps and listen my father scream at her. He told her she was
an unfit mother and that he was going to take me away from her. I’m positive
that was part of the reason she took me and ran. After she was hospitalized and
finally diagnosed, she started her medication and came home. My father couldn’t
understand, and he didn’t want to deal with it or her. He started working late
nights at the hospital, and not too long after everything had happened, he filed
for divorce and sought full custody of me, stating she was incapable of taking
care of me full time. The judge agreed, and he got full custody and she had
visitation. That destroyed her. After the divorce was final, that son of a
bitch opened up his Beverly Hills practice. He purposely waited so she couldn’t
touch it.”
“Jamieson,
I’m so sorry,” Grace spoke as she laid her head on my shoulder.
“He
told me that he opened that practice for me, because I was going to become a
great urologist like him, and after I finished med school and my residency,
we’d run it together. He told me that it was my legacy because his father, my
grandfather, was also a urologist and his father before him. I didn’t want to
be a urologist. I wasn’t sure at that point what field of medicine I wanted to
study until I began researching schizophrenia and the brain. I became
fascinated with neuroanatomy and the complexities of it. I was drawn to the
different types of tumors and the tremendous amount of sacrifice and challenges
that I would be faced with. I couldn’t do anything at that point to save my
mom, because there is no cure for schizophrenia, but I could save other people.
I could restore the normalcy of their lives that the tumors took away from
them. I could give them back to their loved ones. When I explained all this to
my father, he resented me for it and told me that I was going to become a urologist.
He screamed and yelled all the time and said I was nothing but a disappointment.
He told me it was in my blood and that I’d never be good at anything else, even
though I was at a genius level. So, to keep the peace, I led him to believe all
through med school that I was going to be what he wanted me to be. It wasn’t
until my residency that I finally told him to fuck off and that I was going to
be a neurosurgeon. I told him that I was going to find a cure for schizophrenia
and that I was going to help my mom. He called me every name in the book and
told me that I was living a pipedream and one day I’d regret my decision.”
“Oh my
God. He’s such an asshole,” Grace spoke. “What parent does that to their
child?”
“Exactly.
He couldn’t even be bothered to come to my graduation or to any of the award
ceremonies that I was acknowledged at. He completely cut me off during my
residency. The only reason I have the money I do, besides making great money at
my job, is because my grandfather left me a trust fund in my name that I was to
receive in full when I turned twenty-five. It was a secret trust fund that he
kept from my father because he knew how he was. He passed away when I was nineteen,
but I told him in confidence a few months before he passed that I was going to
be the best neurosurgeon in the world and no one was going to stop me. So
you’re right when you say there is no love lost between me and my father. He
can’t stand me as much as I can’t stand him. He never forgave me for going into
neurosurgery and I never forgave him for being a lousy father and for walking
away from my mother when she needed him.”
“Where
did your mom go?” Grace asked.
“Hell
if I know. This is what she does. She disappears and then pops back in every
few years. This last time she was gone for five years and she’ll probably be
gone for another five. I stopped needing her a long time ago. I didn’t need
anyone. I knew what I wanted and what my focus was, my career and my research.”
I glanced over at her. “I’m sorry for the way I treated you and for the things
I said. A part of me felt like my father and I hated it. I’m not him, Grace. I
never will be.”
“You’re
nothing like him, Jamieson.” She placed her hand on my cheek. “You are a good
man.”
The
corners of my mouth curved upwards. “You told me I was Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde.”
“I was
mad.” She wrinkled her nose.
“Listen.”
I took hold of her hand. “We both know things about each other now, so I was
thinking that maybe we could start over. Our secrets are out and maybe it’ll be
easier to get to know each other better. We could start slow or something.”
“We’re
married.” She laughed.
“I
know and maybe we could just forget about that for the time being. I want to
get to know you without all the drama and baggage we both have in our lives.”
“I’d
like that.” She smiled.
“Will
you come home?” I asked.
“Yes.
I’ll come home.” She looked at the clock on the wall. “We both need to be back
here in four hours. Maybe we should just stay and get some sleep.”
“Maybe
we should.” I smiled. “I can shower here, and I have extra clothes I keep in my
office. Shall we?” I motioned for her to lie down.
I
climbed behind her and wrapped my arms around her. There wasn’t much room, but
we fit just fine. I felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders by
telling her everything. For the first time in my life, I felt free, if that
made sense. There was nothing more I was keeping from her, except my feelings.
The ones I tried so hard to fight. I never wanted anything from anyone before,
but now, Grace Harper knew me. She knew my secrets and she knew my flaws and
she didn’t go running for the hills. She stayed wrapped up in my arms and that
made me happy.







Chapter Forty-One

Grace
He
finally opened up to me and I was grateful. I felt sadness listening to him
talk and I couldn’t believe the actions of his father. I now understood why he
was the way he was. The hurt, the anger and the pain consumed him all these
years. He wanted to start over and I was all for it. I always knew there was a
good man deep down inside him that was trying to escape but fear always stopped
him. I lay wrapped in his arms, not very comfortable for the bed was small, but
it didn’t matter. He was here with me. I closed my eyes and for the first time
in so very long, I felt at peace.
“Dr.
Harper,” Rebecca opened the door. “Oh, excuse me. I’m sorry.”
“It’s
fine, Rebecca. What did you need?” I asked in a sleepy voice.
“This
better be good, Dr. Lasher,” Jamieson spoke. “We’ve barely been sleeping.”
“There’s
a trauma coming in. ETA is ten minutes. “Pile up on the highway.”
“I’m
on it. Thank you.”
She
closed the door and I turned and looked at Jamieson.
“Good
morning.” I smiled.
“It
would be better if we could sleep a few more hours,” he spoke.
I
climbed out of bed and changed into a pair of scrubs.
“Work
calls, Dr. Finn,” I spoke.
“I
guess I better get up and help out. It’s going to be crazy out there.”
I went
over to the sink and quickly brushed my teeth, ran a brush through my hair, and
headed out the door.
“Were
you here all night?” Jackie asked.
“Yeah.
I slept in the on-call room.”
“I
paged neuro already. I don’t know when Dr. Finn will be in.”
“He’s
here.” I smiled.
“He
is?”
“Yeah.
He slept in the on-call room too.”
“Everything
okay with you two?” She arched her brow.
“Yeah.
I think everything is going to be okay.”
“I’m
here,” Jamieson said.
“Dr.
Harper, you take trauma one. Dr. Finn, trauma two.”
“What
do we have?” I spoke to Dr. Lasher as I walked into trauma room one and put on
a pair of latex gloves.
“Male,
mid-thirties. BP 88/58, heart rate 120. Abdominal and head trauma.”
I
turned around and froze when I saw him lying there. Suddenly, my heart jumped
into my throat and I began to tremble.
“Dr.
Harper?” Dr. Lasher spoke.
“His
abdomen is distended. Get the ultrasound now.”
“Grace,”
Sam whispered as he stared at me and I stared back.
“Ultrasound
is ready,” Dr. Lasher spoke as she handed me the transducer.
“Is
this the husband?” Jamieson asked as he walked in. “His wife is next door.
She’s stable and wants to know how he is.”
“Dr.
Harper, his stats are dropping. He’s going into V-fib.”
I
stood there and stared at him and then looked at the monitor. I froze.
“Grace?”
Jamieson spoke. “Dr. Harper?” His voice was stern.
“Dr.
Harper!” Dr. Lasher shouted.
“Push
a round of epi and charge the paddles to 200.”
“Epi
is in,” Sara spoke.
“Clear.”
I shocked his chest. “Charge to 200 and push another round of epi. Clear.” I
shocked him again. “Charge to 250. Clear.” I stared at the monitor and nothing.
“Oh no you don’t, you son of a bitch. You are not getting off that easy!” I
spoke through gritted teeth. “Push 20 mgs. of Atropine. Charge to 300.”
“Dr.
Harper,” Jamieson spoke in a stern tone.
“Clear!”
“He’s
got a rhythm,” Dr. Lasher spoke.
“Let’s
get a head CT, stat,” Jamieson said.
“I
need to get him up to the OR and stop the bleeding.”
“Go.
We’ll get the CT up there.”
****
Jamieson
I
stared at Grace as she wheeled the patient out. What the hell happened with
her? I went back to check on my patient in the next room before heading up to
the OR.
“How
is he? How is my husband?” she asked.
“He’s
stable for now and we’re taking him up to the OR. He has some internal bleeding,
but he’s in excellent hands.”
“I
can’t believe this is happening. We were on our way to the airport to catch our
flight home, and out of nowhere, cars just started piling up in front of us. We
were hit really hard from behind.”
“You’re
not from here?” I asked.
“No.
We’re from New York. My husband had a finance conference to attend and he
thought it would be a good idea for me to come and we could turn it into our
anniversary celebration. It was perfect up until this. Dr. Finn, do you think
Sam is going to be okay? I don’t know what I’d do if I lost him.”
“Sam?”
I nervously spoke.
“My
husband’s name is Sam.”
“Excuse
me.”
I
walked out of the room and ran up to the OR. Grace should not be operating on
him. I placed a mask over my face and entered inside.
“Dr.
Harper, I know who your patient is, and I don’t think—”
“Dr.
Finn, his scans are up for you to look at.” She interrupted me mid-sentence.
“I’m in the middle of repairing his spleen and the tear in his abdominal wall.”
I
walked over and took a look at his scans.
“He’s
got a subdermal hematoma. Nothing a simple burr hole won’t fix. I’m going to
scrub in. Get the drill ready.”
I
scrubbed in and then walked over and took the drill from the scrub nurse.
“Are
you doing okay, Dr. Harper?” I asked.
“Of
course. Did his wife say why they’re here in Los Angeles?”
“Umm.
Something about a finance conference.”
There
was no way I was telling her any more than that. I drilled the burr hole and then
assisted Grace with her surgery.
“Close
for me, Dr. Lasher,” she spoke before walking out of the room.
“Grace,
are you okay?”
“I’m
fine, Jamieson. I need to go update his wife.”
“I can
do that. You don’t have to.”
“No. I
want to.”
“You’re
not going to say something, are you?”
“Say
what? That her husband is a lying cheating bastard who carried on a secret
affair with me for over a year?”







Chapter Forty-Two

Grace
I
stepped onto the elevator and Jamieson followed me inside.
“I
think it’s probably best that you don’t tell her. Let me,” Jamieson spoke. “In
fact, you don’t even need to see her.”
“He’s
my patient, Jamieson, and I will give his wife the update.”
I
walked into trauma room two and stared at the pretty brunette lying in the bed.
“How’s
my husband?” she asked.
“I’m
Dr. Harper. I went in and repaired your husband’s spleen and the tear in his
abdominal wall. I was able to stop the bleeding and Dr. Finn was able to
relieve the pressure in his brain. He’s going to be fine.”
“Oh
thank God.” She placed her hand on her chest. “We just celebrated our anniversary.
He’s the love of my life. If something would have happened to him—” She began
to cry. “He’s such an amazing husband and father.”
A
sickness formed in the pit of my belly. I wanted to scream at her that he
wasn’t the man she thought he was.
“Thank
you, Dr. Harper and Dr. Finn, for saving his life,” she spoke. “I will be
forever grateful to both of you. When can I see him?”
“He’s
in recovery right now. You can see him when they move him into a room. Now, if
you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to tend to.”
I
walked out of the room and down the hallway, where I found a gurney to sit on.
“Are
you okay?” Jamieson asked as he sat next to me and placed his hand on my knee.
“She
seems nice and she really loves him,” I spoke.
“Do you?”
Jamieson asked.
“No.
Not at all.” I placed my hand on his. “I just hate him for lying to me and for
what he did to her.”
“That
was pretty evident in the trauma room when he coded. You hesitated, Grace.”
“I was
in shock, Jamieson.”
He
turned his hand over and interlaced our fingers.
“Maybe
you should go home for the rest of the day and get some sleep.”
“I’m
fine.” I laid my head on his shoulder.
“Don’t
make me call your Aunt Cora.”
“You
wouldn’t dare.” I glared at him.
The
corners of his mouth curved up into a cunning grin.
“Then
you don’t know me very well.”
“Jamieson,
come on.” I cocked my head.
“Just
the day, Grace. You barely slept and now this. Just go home. Relax. Go sit on
the beach and just take the day for yourself.” He kissed my forehead. “That’s
an order.”
“Fine.
Are you working late tonight?”
“No.”
He smiled. “I’ll be home for dinner and we can order something in.”
“I
have to tell Renata first.”
“I’ll
tell her. You go. It’ll give her an excuse to harass me.” He winked.
I gave
him a kiss on his cheek, grabbed my things, and made a little detour to the
grocery store before heading home. Jamieson said we could order in for dinner,
but I wanted to cook for him.
****
Jamieson
I
walked up to Renata’s office and lightly knocked on her door.
“Come
in.”
“Do you
have a minute?” I asked.
“Of
course. Have a seat.”
“Grace
went home for the day,” I spoke.
“Is
she sick?”
“No,
but there was a complicated trauma.”
“Jamieson,
what happened?” she asked with concern.
“There
was a pile-up on the highway.”
“Yes,
I heard about that.”
“The
man Grace treated was her ex-boyfriend. He and his wife were here for a finance
conference and an anniversary celebration. They were involved in the
collision.”
“Oh
dear. Are they all right?”
“He
coded in the ER. Grace brought him back and then she took him up to the OR,
where she repaired his spleen and abdominal wall. I was in there with her.”
“She
had no business performing that surgery,” she spoke.
“I
know that, and by time I found out who he was, I ran up there. But you know
her. I suggested she leave for the day. We barely slept last night and now
this.”
“Barely
slept?” Her brow arched.
“It’s
not what you think, Renata. I told her everything about my past and we talked.”
“Really?”
She cocked her head. “And she didn’t go running for the hills, did she?”
“No,
she didn’t.” I smiled.
“Telling
her about your past is a huge step, Jamieson. How do you feel about it?”
“It
felt good to tell her.”
“Sounds
to me like you care for Dr. Harper and you’re finally realizing it.” She softly
smiled.
“I do
care about her a great deal. I guess you could say she’s grown on me.” I
smirked. “Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that she’s gone for the day.”
“That’s
fine. You made the right call. But what about you?”
“What
about me?”
“How
do you feel about this guy here? I’m trusting you aren’t going to say anything
to him, right?”
“No,
of course not. Why would I?”
“Because
he deeply hurt the woman you care about.” Her brow arched.
“It’s
none of my business, Renata.”
“Good.
Keep it that way.”
I got
up from my chair, walked out of her office, and went to Sam’s room to check up
on him. When I walked in with his chart, he slowly opened his eyes.
“You’re
awake. Good. Do you remember what happened?” I asked as I checked his eyes.
“Car
accident. My wife.”
“Except
for a few scrapes and bruises, she’s fine. She’ll be up in a few minutes.”
“I
can’t be here,” he quietly spoke.
“Why?
Because of Grace? You’re lucky she didn’t let you die. Yes, my friend, I know
all about you and what you did to her. I must say, you’ve got some huge balls
for being able to pull that off as long as you did.”
“Who
the hell are you?”
“Oh,
excuse me. My bad. I’m Dr. Finn. The one who drilled the burr hole in your head
to drain the pressure from the fluid that was building up.”
“Why
would she tell you?”
“I’m
not sure you really want me to answer that question.” I smirked. “Anyway, I’ll let
your wife know you’re awake and send her up. She’s a beautiful woman and seems
to love you a lot. I’m still trying to figure out what she sees in you.” I walked
out of the room.
“Jamieson.”
Logan walked up to me and hooked his arm around my neck. “Drinks tonight. I’m
buying.”
“I
can’t, man. I told Grace I’d be home for dinner.”
“What?”
He laughed. “You’re kidding me.”
“No.
I’m not,” I spoke as we walked into my research room. “I told her everything
last night.”
“Damn,
man. You’ve fallen for her.”
“I
care about her and I figured it was time to share that part of my life.”
“Does
this mean the two of you are going to get married? Oh wait, you already are. Is
there no annulment in your future now?”
“There
will be an annulment. I don’t want to be married. Like I said, I care about
Grace, but I don’t want to be married to her.”
“Good
luck with that.” He patted me on the back. “Anyway, I got this today.” He
smiled as he pulled a sonogram photo from his pocket. “It’s a girl.”
“Congratulations.”
I gave him a light hug. “Are things going okay with Riley?”
“Yeah.
Things are great. She’s an amazing woman. Maybe the four of us can go out.”
“Great
idea,” I spoke.







Chapter Forty-Three

Grace
I sat
at the table with my phone next to me, waiting for a call or a text message
from him. Dinner was already cold as it sat on the table for two hours. I took
my plate over to the sink and cleaned up. Just as I was turning off the lights in
the kitchen and heading up to my room, the front door opened, and Jamieson
walked in.
“Hey,”
he spoke. “I got tied up in surgery with a spinal cord injury. Did you eat?”
“Considering
it’s ten o’clock, yeah, I did. There’s leftovers in the refrigerator,” I spoke
as I started walking up the stairs.
“You
cooked?”
“I
did. Good night.”
“Grace,
wait. What do you mean good night?”
“I’m
tired, so I’m going to bed. Enjoy your dinner.”
I went
into my room and shut the door. I was mad. Did I have a right to be? Yeah, I
did, because all he had to do was shoot me a quick message. But instead, I just
sat at the table, across from an empty plate and seat, and waited for him like
an idiot. As I was changing into my pajamas, the door opened.
“Excuse
me?” I cocked my head.
“Please,
it’s not like I haven’t seen you naked before. What is your problem?” he asked
as he stood in the doorway.
“Nothing.”
“Bullshit,
Grace. Talk to me.”
“Fine.
You want to know what my problem is? You could have at least called or texted
me to let me know you wouldn’t be home,” I spoke with an irritated tone as I
put on my pajama bottoms. “I cooked dinner for you. I never cooked for you
before and I thought it would be nice.”
“I’m
sorry. I had an emergency surgery. You of all people should understand that.”
“I do
understand that, but you could have at least called or even had one of your
residents tell me if you couldn’t.”
He
stood there in the doorway and stared at me. I could tell he was carefully
thinking about his next words.
“Patients
come first, Grace, even before you.”
“You
just don’t get it, do you?” I shook my head. “Maybe this thing we’re trying,
whatever it is, isn’t going to work.”
“You’re
right, maybe it isn’t. Good night.” He slammed the door.
“Asshole!”
I yelled.
I
climbed into bed and tossed and turned a few times before I got comfortable. As
I lay there, I thought about why I reacted the way I did. I was a trauma
surgeon and I knew better. I knew emergency surgeries come up all the time that
prevent us from coming home. It’s the life of being a doctor. I used to cancel
on Sam all the time due to emergencies. The difference was I would let him
know. But then again, I had to realize that Jamieson had never been in a
relationship before, and as much as I hated to admit it, he more than likely
didn’t think about telling me. Ugh. I threw back the covers, opened my door,
and walked down the hallway to his bedroom. After lightly knocking, he told me
to come in. When I opened the door, I found him sitting up in bed looking at
his phone. His eyes diverted to me and I stood there for a moment and just
stared him. Neither one of us said a word. I slowly walked over to the other
side of his bed and climbed under the covers. He wrapped his arms around me and
lightly kissed the top of my head.
“I
know I upset you and I’m sorry.”
“And I
realize it really wasn’t your fault. You don’t answer to anyone. You never
have,” I spoke.
“This
is new to me, Grace. It’s going to take some practice, and along the way, I
will make mistakes. I’m going to need you to forgive those mistakes and just
know that I’m trying.”
“I
know. I’m sorry for what I said.”
“Me
too. Next time, I will let you know. I promise.”
I
turned around in his arms and looked up at him. His lips gave way to a small
smile and, instantly, I melted. I climbed on top of him and smashed my mouth
against his. I wanted him like I’d never wanted him before. He welcomed it and
rolled me over on my back, hovering over me and taking total control. After
copious amounts of foreplay, he thrust inside me. My body greeted him with
warmth as he moved in and out of me with perfect rhythm. Our lips meshed, our
hands wandered, and we made love in several positions before he exploded inside
me and I had orgasm number three. I laid my head on his chest and we both fell
asleep until our alarms went off the next morning.
“Shower?”
He smiled as he softly kissed me good morning.
“Definitely.”
I grinned.
****
I took
in a deep breath as I stood outside Sam’s room. His wife was there with him,
holding his hand.
“Good
morning.” I smiled as I looked at her. “Have you been here all night?”
“Yeah.
I couldn’t leave him.”
“Well,
I’m just here to check his vitals and his surgical incisions. Why don’t you go
get yourself a cup of coffee from the cafeteria and maybe some breakfast?”
She
looked over at Sam.
“Go
ahead, sweetheart. Let the doctor do her job.”
She
gave him a smile as she leaned over and gave him a kiss. When she walked out of
the room, I glared at him.
“Grace,
I can’t believe you’re here. So this is where you moved to.”
“Yeah,”
I spoke as I lifted his gown and checked his incisions. “Your wife is very nice
and you’re nothing but a shithead. She doesn’t deserve you. She deserves to
know what a lying, cheating bastard you are.”
“Are
you going to tell her?” he asked with a nervous tone.
“No.
It’s not my place to tell her. You’re the one who lied for over a year. If you
feel the need to seek out other women, you have no business being married. Your
lack of respect for women repulses me. You got lucky that I’m a nice person and
won’t tell her. But when the next woman you lie to comes along, your luck might
just run out.”
“Dr.
Finn was in here yesterday and he told me that you told him about me. Then he
said something really strange.”
“What
did he say?” I asked.
“I
asked him why you would tell him about me and he said I didn’t want to know the
answer. What was he talking about?” 
“Dr.
Finn is my husband.”
“What?”
He swallowed hard.
“Good
morning, Sam.” Jamieson smiled as he walked into the room and took a look at
his head. “I trust my beautiful wife is taking care of you?” He winked at me.
“I
can’t believe you got married. You barely know this guy.”
“Trust
me. She knows me,” Jamieson spoke.
“We
met in New York. In fact, we met while me and you were still together. He’s the
reason I moved here. I didn’t know how to tell you because I didn’t want to
hurt you. So me finding out about your wife was my ticket out. Now, if you’ll excuse
me, I have other patients to see.”
“Grace,
wait!” Sam shouted.
I
walked out of his room and let out a deep breath as I reached the elevator.
Jamieson followed behind.
“Well
played, Dr. Harper.” He grinned.
 “I can’t believe I lied to him like that.”
“Don’t
give it another thought. After what he did to you, he deserved it. Feel better
now?”
“Actually,
I do.” I smiled.
“Good.
Now put that douchebag behind you.” He kissed my lips. “I’ll see you later.”







Chapter Forty-Four

One
Month Later
Grace
“Are
you ready, Dr. Harper?” Jamieson asked as he looked at me.
“I’m
ready, Dr. Finn.”
“Remember,
we have to place the electrodes at the same exact time. If we’re even a split
second off, it’s not going to work, and we only get one shot at this. I’m going
to count to three. One. Two. Three.”
I was
a nervous wreck, but I knew I could do it. I couldn’t let Justin down.
“Okay,
let’s close him up,” Jamieson spoke.
Jamieson
and I scrubbed out and went to talk to Justin’s parents.
“The
surgery went well, but we won’t know the outcome until Justin wakes up. If the
surgery worked, he will need to learn to walk all over again, just like he did
when he was a baby. It’s going to take time and effort, but I’m pretty
confident your son will have full function in his legs.”
“We don’t
know what to say, Dr. Finn.” Justin’s mom hugged him tight. “Thank you.” She
turned and hugged me. “I thank God every single day you were at that
intersection.”
Jamieson
and I turned and walked away.
“Good
job in there. Have you ever thought of maybe expanding your career and doing a
fellowship in neurosurgery?” he asked.
“What?”
I smiled.
“You
can work under me and I’ll teach you.” He grinned.
“Wouldn’t
you be worried that I would be better than you?” I smirked as I bumped his
shoulder with mine.
“Good
point, but the offer is always open.” He kissed my lips before walking away.
“You
two are nauseating.” Jackie smiled.
“We
are, aren’t we?” A grin crossed my face.
I
received a page from Jamieson that Justin was awake. As soon as I got up to his
room, Jamieson was in there examining him.
“Tell
me if you can feel this,” Jamieson spoke as he pricked his foot.
“Ouch.
Yes, I can feel that.” Justin smiled.
“And
this?” Jamieson pricked his leg.
“Ouch.
Yes! Dr. Finn, does that—”
“Yes.
Yes it does, Justin. You will have full use of your legs again.”
Justin
and his parents teared up, as did I. It worked. Jamieson’s surgery worked, and
he might have just helped thousands of people walk again.
****
Tonight
was the night of the hospital’s fundraising gala, so I left early to go home
and get ready because my hairstylist, Larissa, was coming over to do my hair
and makeup.
“How
is everything going with you and Dr. Hottie?” she asked.
“Things
are amazing. I’m really happy.”
“I
think someone is in love.” She grinned. “Have you said it yet?”
“No.
He hasn’t either and I don’t want to be the first one. I’m a firm believer the
man should say it first.”
“I
agree,” she spoke. “But what if he doesn’t? From what you’ve told me, I don’t
think he’s ever told anyone he loved them before.”
“I
thought about that. He’s changed so much since we first met, and I know he’ll
tell me when he’s ready.”
“You’re
gorgeous, Grace.” She smiled as she stared at me through the mirror.
“She
sure is,” Jamieson spoke as he walked into the bathroom. “You look beautiful.”
“Thank
you, Jamieson.”
“Are
the two of you done in here? I need to jump in the shower. If not, I can use one
of the other ones in the house.”
“We’re
done, Dr. Finn,” Larissa spoke as she packed up her things.
I
walked her out and then ran back upstairs to slip into my dress. It was a mermaid-style,
long black and silver, off-the-shoulder dress with flared sleeves. As I was
trying to zip it up, Jamieson walked over in nothing but a towel and soaking
wet hair.
“Let
me get that for you,” he spoke as he slowly zipped it up. “Or maybe, let me
take it off.” His tongue slid across the side of my neck.
“You
will have to wait to get me out of this dress, Dr. Finn. We’re already going to
be late.”
“Fine.”
He let out a sigh.
While
he put on his tuxedo, I sat on the edge of the bed and slipped my feet into a
pair of strappy silver shoes with a stiletto heel. I looked in the mirror one
last time to check my elegant up-do and to touch up my lipstick.
We
arrived at the Le Foyer Ballroom in North Hollywood, and as soon as we stepped
inside, we were greeted with a glass of champagne.
“There
you two are,” Renata spoke as she gave us each a hug. “Grace, you look gorgeous.”
“Thanks,
Renata. So do you. I love that color on you.”
“Aren’t
you going to tell me I look gorgeous too?” Jamieson asked her.
“No,
dear. You already know you look gorgeous.” She gave him a wink.
Jamieson
and I parted ways for a bit to talk to different people. As I was talking to
Dr. Park, I looked across the room and saw Jamieson’s step-mother standing by
the bar.
“Mrs.
Finn.” I smiled as I walked over to her. “I don’t know if you remember me.”
“Of
course I do. Dr. Grace Harper, right?”
“Yes.”
“How lovely
to see you again. How have you been?”
“I’ve
been great. How was your cruise?”
“Magnificent.
Any time I get to spend with Carlyle is precious. You know how hectic doctors’
schedules are. I was hoping that Jamieson is here. Have you seen him?”
“Yes.
We drove together. He’s around here somewhere.”
“So
are the two of you dating?” She slyly smiled.
“As a
matter of fact, we are.”
“As in
long-term dating or just a casual fling?”
I
couldn’t believe she asked me that.
“I’m
not really sure.” I laughed. “I’m hoping for long-term.”
“Wow.
I’m so happy to hear that. You know, he doesn’t come around much. I’ve invited
him to several events and even dinner at our home, but he never shows.”
“Well,
I know him and Carlyle don’t get along.”
“So
Jamieson told you everything?”
“He
did.” I nodded my head.
“I can
honestly say that I’m shocked. He must really love you.” The corners of her
mouth curved up into a smile as she lightly placed her hand on my arm. “All I
want is to see him happy.”
“Me
too.”
“If
you’ll excuse me, I need to go find him and talk to him.”
“Sure.
Of course. It was nice to see you again.”
“You too,
Grace. I would love to have the two of you over. Maybe you can talk Jamieson
into coming.”
“I can
try.” I smiled.
A
waiter walked by with a tray in his hand and I grabbed another glass of
champagne. When I turned around, I saw Jamieson’s father approaching me.
“Dr.
Harper, it’s nice to see you again. You look stunning.”
“Thank
you, Dr. Finn. Please call me Grace.”
“And
you shall call me Carlyle. I saw your presentation at the medical conference.
Very impressive. How are things going for you here?”
“Things
are great. Jamieson just made a breakthrough in medicine. The two of us helped
a sixteen-year-old boy who was paralyzed walk again.”
“Isn’t
that nice. But I have a question for you. Are you involved with my son?” he
asked.
“Yes.
I am. The two of us are dating.”
Shit. There was no way I was
telling him we were actually married.
“I
hope you know what you’ve gotten yourself into. You’re a beautiful and
intelligent woman. You’ll figure it out soon enough and leave him.”
Okay. Now I was pissed.
“Actually,
Carlyle, I’m in love with your son and I know exactly who he is. He is kind,
generous, loving, and a brilliant surgeon. He is everything I ever wanted in a
man.”
“I
have no idea who you are describing, but that sure isn’t my son. My son is a
narcissistic, arrogant, and disrespectful man.” 
I
could feel the anger burning inside me and I tried so hard to keep my mouth
shut, but I couldn’t. I wasn’t about to stand there and listen to this man talk
bullshit about my husband.
“Maybe
if you weren’t such a terrible father, he wouldn’t be that way to you.”
“Excuse
me, young lady? Who the hell do you think you are?”
His
uncoordinated eye movement caught my attention.
“I’m
the woman who loves your son,” I calmly spoke.
“I
don’t know what he’s told you, but he’s crazy like his mother.”
He
went to grab a drink from the waiter’s tray and he dropped it.
“Goddamn
it!” he shouted. “Now look what you made me do!”
“What
is going on?” Jamieson asked as he walked over.
“Your
girlfriend here made me drop my drink!”
“Carlyle,
it’s okay, honey,” Tracy spoke. “We’ll get someone to clean it up and I’ll get you
another one.”
“You
need to keep your girl in line, son. She is disrespectful to her peers.”
“And
I’m sure you said something to her that warranted that disrespect,” Jamieson
spoke sternly as he got in his father’s face.
I
stepped between them and placed my hand on Jamieson’s chest.
“Don’t.
Father or not, he’s not worth it.”
Jamieson
looked at me and then took a step back. I turned to Tracy.
“About
that dinner invitation, I don’t think we’ll be able to make it,” I spoke as I
took hold of Jamieson’s hand and led him across the ballroom.






Chapter Forty-Five

Jamieson
“What
the hell did he say to you?” I asked Grace.
“It
doesn’t matter. What did Tracy want to talk to you about?”
“It
does matter, Grace. I want to know what the hell happened.”
“I
promise to tell you later and then you can tell me.”
“Grace,”
I pursed my lips.
“We’ll
talk later, Jamieson. Now let’s go mingle.”
Grace
and I left the gala before it was over and headed home. As we were driving, I
felt it was the right time for her to tell me what happened between her and my
father.
“Talk
to me. What happened between you and my father? What did he say?”
She
sighed as she looked over at me and placed her hand on my leg.
“Your
father is a very angry man. He was insulting you, and I wasn’t going to stand
around and let him. So I told him that maybe if he wasn’t such a terrible
father, you wouldn’t act that way towards him.”
“Jesus,
Grace. You said that to him?”
“Yes.
And I don’t apologize for it either. He is everything you told me he was. I
like to give people the benefit of the doubt because there’s two sides to every
story. But him, he proved it right off the bat. Your father is a complete
asshole.”
I let
out a light laugh.
“I
told you he was. Tracy said she thinks something is wrong with him.”
“Like
what?”
“She
said he’s been having trouble swallowing and choking a lot on his food. He’s
been having frequent headaches, mood swings, and his blood pressure is high, so
he prescribed himself blood pressure medication.”
“I
noticed a couple things myself while he was verbally assaulting me.”
“What
things?”
“His
uncoordinated eye movement for one and the fact that when he went to pick up a
glass of champagne from the tray, he dropped it. Maybe there is something
wrong.”
“I
don’t know. I told Tracy there was nothing I could do if he didn’t come see me,
and we both know Hell will freeze over before that happens. First, he’d have to
admit he was having problems and he’s a stubborn son of a bitch. He’ll almost
have to be on death’s bed before he seeks help.”
I
pulled into the driveway and we both climbed out of the car and went inside the
house.
“Maybe
you could talk to him?”
“Talk
to him? Are you kidding me? I am not talking to him. If he doesn’t think he has
a problem, there’s nothing I can do. Plus, I might punch him for what he said
to you. So I don’t think you want me talking to him.”
We
both went upstairs, and she asked me to unzip her dress.
“I
thought you’d never ask.” I softly kissed her neck as I grabbed hold of her
zipper and slowly pulled it down. “I’ve been waiting to take you out of this
dress all night.”
The next
morning, Grace climbed out of bed and I noticed she was walking funny.
“Are
you okay? You’re walking weird.”
“Really?”
Both her brows raised as she turned and looked at me.
“What?”
I held out my hands.
“We
did it like four times last night. And pretty rough, may I add. Excuse me if
I’m a little sore and inflamed.”
“I’m
sorry.” I pouted. “Let me take a look. I can kiss it and make it all better.” I
smirked.
“Absolutely
not! You aren’t going anywhere near there for at least a couple of days. So
keep your dick in your pants, Dr. Finn, because my pleasure box is closed for
maintenance.”
“Damn,
Grace.” I laughed. “Since you put it that way, I’m afraid your pleasure box is
now a hazardous zone.”
“That’s
right. Remember that!” She pointed at me as she waddled her way into the
bathroom.
I
couldn’t stop laughing. She was just way too adorable, and I loved having her
here with me.
****
One Month Later
Grace
“What
do we have?” I asked as I pulled open the back door of the ambulance.
“Krista
Reeves, thirty-three-year-old female who is thirty-six weeks pregnant. She fell
down a couple of stairs and is complaining of back and abdominal pain.”
“Hi, Krista.”
I smiled. “I’m Dr. Harper. Let’s see what’s going on.”
We
wheeled her into trauma room two and transferred her to the bed.
“Did
you hit your head?” I asked.
“No.
My back is killing me.”
“Dr.
Lasher, page OB.”
“Right
away, Dr. Harper.”
I
hooked her up to the fetal monitor and then performed an ultrasound.
“OH MY
GOD!!” she screamed as she gripped the sides of the bed.
“Your
baby looks great, Krista, and it appears you are in labor. Dr. Lasher, let’s
get an X-ray of her back just to be safe.”
“Make
it stop, Dr. Harper. I can’t have this baby yet. My husband is out of town on
business. He’s due back tomorrow.”
“I’m
going to examine you to see what’s going on with your cervix. Is that okay?”
She
lightly nodded her head as she let out another scream. I put her feet in the
stirrups and examined her.
“Krista,
your baby is coming. Where’s OB?” I asked Dr. Lasher.
“She’s
in surgery right now.”
“FUCK!”
Krista screamed.
“We
need to deliver your baby, Krista, so I’m going to need you to take in a deep
breath and get ready to push.”
“No. I
can’t without my husband. I need him here. I need his support. We were supposed
to do this together. I’m not pushing until he gets here. Do what you have to.
Push that baby back up there.”
“Dr.
Lasher, hold her hand.”
“No. I
need my husband,” Krista spoke. “I am not doing this without him.”
“How
about a substitute husband?” I asked her and Dr. Lasher shot me a look.
“What
do you mean?” she shouted.
“I can
get you someone in here to help you out and you can pretend he’s your husband.”
My God, what was I saying?
“I
can’t do it. I’m not having this baby yet.”
“I’m
sorry, Krista, but your baby is coming whether you like it or not. Trust me,
you will like who I have in mind.”
“Fine,”
she spoke.
“Page
Dr. Finn stat.” I smiled at Dr. Lasher.
“Are
you serious?”
“Yes.
I know he’s available because he doesn’t have any surgeries today. He’s doing
his research.”
Krista
moaned and groaned.
“You
paged me?” Jamieson spoke as he walked in the room.
“Yes.
Can I speak to you in the hallway for a moment?”
“What’s
up?” he asked.
“My
patient is having her baby and she refuses to push until her husband gets here
and he’s out of town at the moment. So I need you to be her pretend husband and
tell her to push and support her so she can deliver this baby without any
complications.”
“You
can’t be serious?”
“I’m
dead serious.”
“Grace,
come on.” He cocked his head. “Screaming pregnant women make me nervous.”
“Get
in there!”
“For fuck
sakes.” He sighed.
“Krista,
this is Dr. Finn. He’s going to help you through your labor. Just pretend he’s
your husband.”
“Lord
have mercy.” She smiled at me.
“It
shouldn’t be hard to pretend. Plus, he has experience pretending to be
someone’s husband.” I grinned. “Now let’s bring your baby into the world.”
Jamieson
clasped her hand and talked her through her labor pains.
“Push,
Krista,” I spoke as I could see the baby’s head.
She
gave one hard push and collapsed back onto the bed.
“I
can’t do this anymore. Just go up there and rip this kid out of me. She’s
killing me.”
“Come
on, Krista. You can do this,” Jamieson spoke. “A couple more pushes and you’ll
be holding your baby in your arms.”
“Just
focus on Dr. Finn, Krista.”
Jamieson
shot me a look and I couldn’t help but smile.
She
stared at him as she screamed and pushed as hard as she could.
“Here
she comes. One more is all it will take. One more, Krista.”
“I
can’t. I’m sorry. I can’t,” she spoke in exhaustion.
“Krista,
push that baby out now!!” Jamieson spoke in a stern tone.
She
sat up and gave one last push and heard the cries of her newborn baby. OB
finally made it down and took over.
“You’re
a little late,” I spoke as I looked at Dr. Edmonds.
“I was
in surgery. Good job, Dr. Harper. I got it from here.”
Jamieson
and I walked out of the room and he kept rubbing his hand.
“Damn
it. I think she broke my hand.”
“You’re
fine. Thank you.” I smiled.
“Don’t
ever do that to me again. You owe me.”
“Fine.
Whatever you want.”
He
laughed as he began to walk away.
“You’re
going to regret saying that, Dr. Harper.”







Chapter Forty-Six

Two
Months Later
Grace
I had finally
fallen asleep, when my pager went off. Reaching my arm and feeling around on
the floor of the on-call room, I picked it up and looked at it. I sighed as I
got up from the bed and walked outside to wait for the ambulance to pull up.
When it did, and I opened the door, I saw Tracy sitting there.
“Tracy?”
I looked at her and then at Jamieson’s father lying on the stretcher. “What
happened?”
“He’s
been in bed for two days with a migraine and he’s been vomiting profusely. He
wouldn’t let me take him to the doctor. I think he’s dehydrated.”
“I
don’t need a damn doctor. I am a doctor and it’s a migraine,” Carlyle shouted.
“BP is
140/90 and his pulse is 130,” the paramedic spoke.
“This
is humiliating, Tracy. I can’t believe you called 911.”
“If
you weren’t such a stubborn ass, I wouldn’t have had to. You gave me no
choice.”
“Let’s
take him to room three,” I spoke. “Dr. Lasher, I want a comprehensive metabolic
panel, CBC with Diff and blood gases. Get him on an IV drip and oxygen.”
“Grace,
can I speak with you, please?” Tracy asked.
We
walked out into the hallway.
“He’s
been sick for a couple of months, but he refused to seek medical attention. Do
you know what could be wrong? I’m so worried.”
“We
have to run some tests. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon.” I placed my
hand on her arm as we walked back into the room.
“Order
an MRI with contrast and get him upstairs,” I spoke to Dr. Lasher.
“This
is ridiculous,” Carlyle spoke in anger.
“Carlyle,
shut up,” I spoke. “You’re sick and you need medical treatment. So, for the
love of God, just be quiet and let us find out what’s wrong with you.”
“I’ve
had enough of your mouth, young lady.”
“And
I’ve had enough of yours. Excuse me for a moment. I’ll be right back.”
I knew
Jamieson was in surgery, so I went up to OR four, held a mask over my mouth,
and stepped inside.
“Hello,
Dr. Harper. To what do I owe the pleasure?” he asked.
“How
much longer are you going to be?”
“I’d
say about fifteen more minutes. Why?”
“I
need to speak to you when you’re done.”
“About?”
“About
a patient down in the ER.”
“Okay.
I’ll be down as soon as I’m done.”
“Actually,
I’ll be waiting for you in the hallway,” I spoke.
He
glanced over at me and our eyes locked on each other’s. He picked up on the
seriousness of my tone.
“Okay.
I’ll meet you out there.”
As I
was waiting in the hall, Renata walked over to me.
“I
heard Jamieson’s father is in the ER causing havoc.”
“He
sure is.” I sighed.
“What’s
wrong with him?”
“I’m
not sure yet, but I have my suspicions.”
“Something
serious?” she asked.
“Yeah.
I think so.”
“Does
Jamieson know yet?”
“I’m
waiting for him to get out of surgery.”
“Okay.”
She heavily sighed. “This isn’t going to be pretty.”
As
soon as Jamieson was finished with his surgery, he stepped out into the
hallway.
“What’s
going on with your patient?” he asked.
“Jamieson,
it’s your father. He’s down in the ER.”
“For
what?”
“Tracy
called 911 and had him transported by ambulance. He’s been in bed the past
couple of days with a migraine and vomiting. She also said he fell the other
day and he hasn’t been sleeping at all.”
He
rubbed the back of his neck as he turned away from me.
“Did
you order an MRI with contrast?” he asked.
“I
did. He should be in there now.” I placed my hand on his back.
“Then
let’s go.”
We
walked to the MRI room and Jamieson asked the radiologist to leave. We sat down
and waited for the MRI to complete and the scans to produce on the monitors.
“Here
they come,” Jamieson spoke.
He sat
there in silence and began to rub his forehead.
“Is
that—” I started to speak.
“It
sure is. Damn it!”
“Jamieson,
I’m sorry.”
“We
better go tell him. I’m the last person he’s going to want to hear this from.”







Chapter Forty-Seven

Jamieson
I
would love to say this was karma at its finest. As much as I hated the man, a
sickness tore through me. We walked down to his room in ER.
“Dad.
How are you feeling?”
“What
are you doing here?”
“I
work here, remember?”
“I know
that, but I don’t need you down here, so tell your step-mother that she wasted
all of our time by bringing me here.”
“Dad,
I read the results of your MRI.”
“Why
would you do that? You’re not my doctor,” he growled.
“Dr.
Harper came to me, not because you were my father, but because she suspected
you needed a neuro consult.”
“And?
Spit it out, Jamieson.”
I
swallowed hard.
“You
have a tumor on your brainstem. It’s what we call a brainstem glioma.”
“Brain
cancer?” Tracy spoke.
“Yes,
Tracy, that’s what a glioma is,” my father grumbled.
“Oh my
God, Carlyle.” She grabbed his hand. “Then you’ll have it removed and you’ll be
fine. Right?” She looked at me.
“Where
the tumor is located on the brainstem, it’s nearly impossible to remove. To be
honest, I’ve never seen one in this part of the brainstem. Even a partial
resection wouldn’t help. We can try to shrink it with radiation and a
chemotherapy cocktail.”
“How
long do I have?” my father asked me. “And be honest. Don’t try to sugarcoat the
fact that I’m dying.”
“About
a year,” I nervously spoke.
My
father turned his head away and was silent for a few moments. Grace reached
over and placed her hand on my shoulder.
“You’re
a world-class neurosurgeon. You’ve removed even the most impossible tumors and
you will remove this one.”
“Dad.
I don’t think you understand.”
“No!
You don’t understand, Jamieson. I’m not ready to leave this world yet and I’m
not ready to leave my wife. You will remove this tumor from me and give me more
time,” he shouted. “Prove to me that you can do the impossible. Prove to me
that this is why you chose neurosurgery.”
“Carlyle,
I don’t think you understand the significant risks involved,” Grace spoke.
“I
know all the risks and I’m willing to take them. Now I need my son to do the
same.”
“You
could die on that operating table, or worse yet, come out of the surgery with
an impact of deficits,” I spoke.
“Then
you’ll make sure that doesn’t happen,” he spoke.
“I’m
not making any promises. I’m going to order brain mapping tests and we’ll go
from there.  Until then, Grace is
admitting you.”
I
walked out of the room and Grace followed me up to my office.
“He’s
asking me to do something I can’t do. He’s just doing this so I’ll fail and
then he can really hate me for the time he has left.”
“That’s
not true, Jamieson.”
“Yes
it is, Grace!” I shouted. “He’s a doctor, he knows the risks. He’s doing this
to hurt me.”
She
walked over and wrapped her arms around me.
“You
love challenges. You told me there was no way Justin was ever going to walk
again. You shut down my electrode suggestion. Then you researched it more and
figured it out. You did what those doctors in Switzerland failed to do.”
“This
is different, and you know it.”
“Not
really. Just think about it.”
Her
pager went off.
“I
have a trauma coming in.” She kissed me. “Think about it.”
A
couple days later, I sat in the imaging room and had all my father’s scans up
from his CT, angiogram, MRI, and PET scan. I stared at them for hours and
worked on a brain model to see if what I came up with would work. It didn’t. I
was frustrated, and I was tired.
“Dr.
Finn, can I speak to you for a moment?” Renata asked as she walked into the
room.
“Sure.”
I rubbed my forehead.
“I
told your father that it is against hospital policy to let a family member
treat him, and that I can’t allow it.”
“What
did he say to that?”
“He
told me that you are operating on him and if I have a problem with it, he will
get in touch with his friends on the board and have me fired.”
“Yep.
Sounds like him.”
“It’s
not fair that he’s doing this to you, Jamieson.”
“He’s
never been a fair man.”
“If
you can’t truly do it, then don’t.” She placed her hand on my shoulder. “There
are just some things we doctors can’t do and you have to realize that.”
“I
know, Renata. Thank you.”
“Let
me know what you decide,” she spoke before walking out of the room.
****
By
time I got home, Grace was already in bed. I quietly stripped out of my clothes
and climbed in next to her.
“Are
you okay?” she asked as she rolled over away from me and I wrapped my arms
around her.
“I think
I figured out a way to remove the tumor.” I kissed the back of her head.
“What?”
She quickly turned around and faced me.
“It’s
going to take at least twelve hours, and that’s providing there are no
complications.”
“Are
you sure?” She placed her hand on my cheek.
“Not
really, but I have to try. We can tell him tomorrow.”
The
next morning, Grace and I went to my father’s room and told him exactly what I
was going to do.
“I
want Grace in there assisting you,” he spoke.
“What?
Why?” I asked.
“Because
she’s a snippy little thing and she’ll set you straight if something goes wrong
and you panic.”
“Dad,
I don’t think—”
“This
is my brain you’re cutting into and if I want Dr. Harper in that room, then she
better damn well be.”
I
looked at Grace, who had a frightened look on her face.
“You
heard the man,” I spoke to her.
“Okay.
I’ll be in there, Carlyle.”
As we
were about to walk out of the room, my father cleared his throat.
“By
the way, why haven’t you two told me that you got married?” he asked.
Both
of us froze and then slowly turned around and stared at him.
“The
nurse told me,” he spoke.
“It’s
complicated,” I said. “We were both drunk and it will be annulled in three
months.”
“Why
three months?” he asked.
“That’s
another complicated story. One I’ll tell you after your surgery.”
“Jamieson,
can I speak with you alone?”
“Sure.”
I looked at Grace. “I’ll talk to you later.”
“Come
here,” my father spoke.
I took
a seat in the chair next to his bed and he reached over and placed his hand on
mine.
“You
are a brilliant surgeon and I want you to know how proud I am to have you as my
son.”
“Dad—”
“Let
me finish. If something happens to me, I don’t want you to blame yourself. Promise
me that you won’t.”
“Nothing
is going to happen, Dad.”
“Come
on, Jamieson. We’re both doctors and we know this surgery has way too many
risks. Risks I’m willing to take to give me more time with my family. I want to
make right the things I’ve done wrong, especially where you’re concerned. I’m
sorry, son, for everything.”
“I’m
sorry, Dad.”
“Don’t
be. If my father would have treated me the way I treated you, I would have acted
the same way.”






Chapter Forty-Eight

Three
Months Later
Grace
Jamieson’s
removal of his father’s brainstem tumor was a success. It took a total of
fourteen hours and there were only a couple complications, but nothing Jamieson
couldn’t figure out. He was a rock star, and I loved him more each and every
day. His father was undergoing chemotherapy and was doing well. The
relationship between Jamieson and him was also getting stronger.
We
still hadn’t said those three little words to each other that would change our
lives forever. I was positive he loved me, but I didn’t want to put any
pressure on him. He needed to say it first. In two days, we were scheduled to
go back to court to get our marriage annulled. We hadn’t talked about it at all
and, frankly, I didn’t want to. Being with Jamieson was the best thing that had
ever happened to me, and I thanked God every day for the circumstances in my
life that led me to him. I was getting a little worried since we hadn’t talked
about it and what would happen next. I had assumed things would go on as
normal, but I was seriously mistaken.
****
Jamieson
I had
a decision to make and it was the hardest decision of my life. I had my reasons.
Reasons nobody could understand. I had to be one hundred percent sure. Even
though I knew I was, I had gotten comfortable with Grace living with me, something
I thought I’d never get used to. I know you’re thinking I’m the biggest dick on
the planet, and you’re probably right. But like I said, I had my reasons.
I told
her I’d meet her at the courthouse. I didn’t think it was a good idea that we
drove together. I kissed her goodbye at the hospital and told her that I
wouldn’t be too far behind her because I needed to check on one of my patients
first. I met her in the hallway with my lawyer and we walked into the
courtroom. After the judge entered, we took our seats.
“Hello,
Dr. Finn. Dr. Harper. It’s good to see both of you again.”
“Hello,
your Honor,” we both spoke.
“I was
hoping that this court date would be cancelled by the both of you because you
decided you didn’t want the annulment. So I’m going to ask each of you
separately one question. Dr. Finn, do you still want your marriage annulled?”
“Yes,
your Honor. I do,” I spoke.
“Dr.
Harper, are you in agreement with Dr. Finn? Do you also want your marriage
annulled?”
Grace
sat there in silence for a few moments while she stared at the judge.
“Grace?”
Tony spoke.
“Yes,
your Honor. I do.”
“Okay,
then. It is by the order of this court that the marriage between Dr. Jamieson
Finn and Dr. Grace Harper be annulled effective immediately.”
She
signed the paper in front of her and then looked at both of us. 
“I’m
sorry for the both of you, but I hope you learned a valuable lesson. Court is
adjourned.”
She
got up from her seat and went into her chambers. I looked over at Grace and
placed my hand on hers. She immediately pulled away from me as she stood up from
her chair and walked out of the courtroom.
****
Grace
I had
to get out of there as fast as I could before I broke down in front of him. He
ran after me and lightly grabbed hold of my arm.
“Grace,
I’m sorry.”
“Don’t
be,” I spoke as I fought to hold back the tears. “We knew this day was coming.
So now you’re a free man. Just like you wanted. If you’ll excuse me, I was
paged while we were in court. I have to get back to the hospital. I will have
my things out of your house as soon as possible.”
“Grace,
please. Don’t leave like this. Clearly, you’re upset.”
“My
patients come first. Not you and not this situation.”
I
walked to my car with my head held high. As soon as I climbed in, the tears
started to stream down my face like a waterfall. The hurt that I felt as my
heart shattered was unbearable. I’d never felt this kind of pain before. Not
even with Sam. This was something new and unfamiliar and I hated every moment
of it. I felt like my life had just been turned upside down and I didn’t know
what to do. Clearly, this relationship was one-sided the entire time, and once
again, I was blind to it. I lied to him about being paged. I called Renata and
told her I wasn’t coming back today and that I’d be taking a few personal days.
She said she understood and that she’d check in on me later.
I
drove to Jamieson’s house and packed up all my things. Before shutting the
door, I stood in the foyer and looked at the home that I had lived in with the
man I loved for the past six months. The only person in my life that I was
truly in love with. I had finally understood what love was, only to have it
ripped from me.
I
drove to my apartment and got my new set of keys from the manager. Opening the
door, I brought all my things in and collapsed on the couch. I cried myself
into oblivion until I passed out. I was awoken by a knock on the door. My heart
jumped into my throat at the possibility it could be Jamieson.
“Grace,
open up. It’s Renata, sweetheart.”
I
climbed off the couch, my eyes red and swollen from all the crying I’d done
earlier. I opened the door, and when she saw me, a saddened look crossed her
face.
“Come
here, baby.” She hugged me. “I brought you some food.”
“I’m
not hungry.” I closed the door. “Can I make you some coffee or tea?”
“No. I
will make it for you. Go sit down. I want to make one thing clear to you. You
are not quitting the hospital because of him. You don’t give him that kind of
power.”
“After
everything we’ve been through the past six months, how can he just throw it all
away? I was such a fool. I truly thought he loved me. I could feel it. And the
way he didn’t even hesitate when the judge asked him if he still wanted the
annulment.”
“He’s
the one who’s a fool. Not you. You’re going to be okay, Grace.” She set a cup
of tea down in front of me.
“I
don’t think I will be. Not this time. My heart is so broken, and I don’t think
it will ever heal. I have never loved anyone like I loved him. He destroyed me,
Renata.”
“Now
you listen to me. I’m giving you tough love here. Just like I did when you were
my resident. You don’t let any man destroy you. Especially Dr. Jamieson Finn.
You are a brilliant surgeon and a kind and compassionate woman. You have so
much to offer and he’s the idiot that can’t see it. What he did is a reflection
of him, not you. He will be forever working out his mommy and daddy issues. Alone,
may I add! You’re going to meet someone special and have a family, and he’ll be
sitting in his lonely beach house wishing he’d never let you go.”
“I
doubt it. I don’t want to meet anyone else. I really thought we had a future
together.” The tears streamed down my face.
“The
only future Jamieson Finn has is the lonely path he’s walking. He may not
realize it now. It may take ten or twenty years, but he will one day. I could
just kill that man!”






Chapter Forty-Nine

Jamieson
I knew
what I did, and I wasn’t proud of it. Not in the least. I got tied up in a six-hour
surgery. The OR was the only place where I didn’t have to think about her. I
went home and there was silence. I walked upstairs and stared at the empty
closet. I needed to do this, and I knew she’d never understand. We got married
on a whim, a drunken whim, and that was no way to stay married.
I went
downstairs, poured a double scotch, and took it over to the couch. I grabbed my
phone from my pocket and sent her a text message.
“I’m so sorry. Please forgive me.”
I hit
send and waited for it to be delivered. But it never went through. Great. She
blocked me. I sighed as I finished off my drink and poured another one. A
couple of days had passed, and Renata was giving me the cold shoulder. My pager
went off and I was needed for a consult in the ER. I hadn’t seen Grace at the
hospital since the day of our court hearing. She sure was doing a good job of
avoiding me.
“Did
Dr. Harper page me for a consult?” I asked Jackie.
“No.
Dr. Harper isn’t here. She took a personal leave of absence.” She gave me a
disgusted look. “Dr. Wilson paged you.”
“What
do you mean she took a personal leave of absence?”
“It’s
really none of your business, Dr. Finn. You are no longer her husband, so you
don’t have the right to know anything concerning her. Don’t you have a
consult?” Her brow arched.
I
narrowed my eye at her and then walked away. After my consult, my schedule was
clear for the day, so I went into my research room.
“There
you are. I figured I’d find you here. How are you doing?” Logan asked.
“How
do you think I’m doing?” I snarled.
“Don’t
give me an attitude, man. You’re doing this to yourself. If you want my honest
opinion, I think you majorly suck and you’re playing roulette. There’s no
guarantee she’ll ever take you back. I’m not sure I would.”
“I
didn’t ask for your opinion, did I?”
“Look
at you. You’re miserable. Swallow your damn pride and beg her to forgive you.”
“Don’t
you have bones you need to set or something?” I asked with an irritated tone.
“Sorry,
but I can’t side with you on this. It’s wrong on so many levels. I know you’re
used to playing with women’s emotions, but Grace just isn’t any ordinary woman
and you know it. She’s the one.” He pointed at me. “And you’ve gone and fucked
all that up. I can honestly say, Jamieson, that I don’t even know who you are
anymore.” He walked out of the room.
I
sighed as I took my hand and knocked all the papers I had off the table.
****
Grace
I was
offered the Head of Trauma position at Boston General. A ten-minute Skype
interview and the job was mine.
“You’re
running again.” My Aunt Cora narrowed her eye at me as we Facetimed.
“No,
I’m not. This is an excellent opportunity for me.”
“You’re
running, Grace. You ran from New York because of a man and now you’re running
from California for the same reason. Is this what you’re going to keep doing
every time a man hurts you? It’s unhealthy and I thought you were stronger than
that.”
“I am
strong, Aunt Cora, and like I said, this is a step up for me.”
“Bullshit,”
she shouted. “If you were still with Jamieson, you wouldn’t be doing this.
You’re running!”
“Fine.
I’m running! I can’t stay here and work at the same hospital as him. It hurts
too damn much.”
“I
know it hurts. I was in your shoes before. Many many years ago before your
parents died. But you know what I did? I stayed because I was strong, and I had
something to prove to myself.”
“And
what was that?” I asked.
“That
I would not allow one person to dictate and control my entire life. You, my
love, can rise up from anything. You can completely recreate yourself. All that
matters is that you decide today and you never look back. So what if you’ll see
him at the hospital. Yes, it will hurt like hell for a while, but you’ll get
over it. You’ll move on and, ultimately, you’ll be glad things worked out the
way they did. Face the anger, sweetheart. Don’t run from it.”
We
talked for a while more and then she had to go. I took in everything she said
and thought that maybe she was right. I loved my job here and I made a lot of
new friends. I already left one tribe back in New York and I really didn’t want
to leave another one. But having to see him every day and page him for consults
was something I didn’t think I would be able to handle.
****
Jamieson
I
tossed and turned all night. I’d roll over and feel the empty space beside me
and feel sick to my stomach. Two weeks had passed, and I still hadn’t seen her.
Two goddamn weeks and I couldn’t take it anymore. I was more fucked up than I
thought I was. I believed this was a good idea so I’d know that I hadn’t just
gotten accustomed to her living here because she was forced to. I loved her. I
was in love with her and I knew I was from the beginning. But it took this to
make me realize that I couldn’t live without her. My world was so dark without
her in it. For the first time in my life since my mother left when I was a
child, I felt alone. I felt broken in so many ways. I’d always been broken, but
then Grace came into my life, and as much as I wanted to blame her for fucking
it up, she was the one who made me whole again. She made me feel safe and
loved. And what did I do? I destroyed us because I had to put myself to the
test. I had to verify that what I felt was real because I’d never felt anything
like it before.
“Is
Grace back yet?” I asked Jackie.
“Nope,”
she spoke in a harsh tone as she stared at her computer.
“Where
the hell is she?”
“A
personal leave. I already told you that.”
“For
how long?”
“I
don’t know. I guess whenever she decides to come back.”
“Have
you spoken to her?”
“Even
if I did, I wouldn’t tell you. You lost that right, Dr. Finn.”
I
rolled my eyes and sighed as I walked away. I wanted to leave the hospital and
go over to Grace’s apartment and beg her to forgive me, but I got pulled into
an emergency craniotomy. I’d go over there tonight, and if she wasn’t home, I’d
wait for her until she got back.







Chapter Fifty

Grace
It was
seven p.m. and I decided instead of ordering take out, I’d run down to the family-owned
market a couple of blocks away and pick up something to make for dinner. As I
was walking down the aisle looking for a can of diced tomatoes, I ran into
Billy, one of the police officers I knew.
“Hey,
Grace. How are you?”
“I’m
good, Billy. How are you?”
“No
complaints. I haven’t seen you at the hospital in a while.”
“I
took a personal leave of absence for a bit.”
“Oh.
Everything okay?”
“Yeah.
Everything is okay. How’s Holly?”
“She’s
great. We just celebrated our five-year anniversary last night. Five blissful
years.” He grinned.
Suddenly,
we heard one of the cashiers up front in a panic. She was yelling, “Please
don’t hurt me.”
“Stay
here, Grace, and get down,” Billy spoke as he reached for his gun. “All of you
get down.”
The
only other people in the store besides me and Billy were two cashiers and three
other customers in the same aisle as us. I didn’t know what was going on, so I
crouched down and slowly made my way to the end of the aisle. There were two
guys in ski masks holding up the cashiers. Billy slowly made his way to them,
and when one of them turned around and saw him in uniform, he fired his gun and
Billy went down. I gasped as I covered my mouth with my hand. My body began to
shake, and my heart was pounding out of my chest. I reached in my purse, took
out my cellphone, and dialed 911, then placed it in my pocket. I looked over at
the other customers, who were down on the floor, scared to death. Another
gunshot went off and I noticed it was Billy who shot one of the men. The other
guy in the green ski mask yelled and began firing his gun at Billy, shooting
him several times in the chest. I was paralyzed with fear, but my doctor
instincts kicked in.
“Noah,
come on man.” The guy in the green ski mask ran over to him in a panic.
I
needed to think of something fast. I slowly stood up with my hands in the air
and approached the man as he held his gun to me.
“I’m a
doctor,” I nervously spoke. “I can help your friend.”
“What
kind of doctor are you?”
“I’m a
trauma surgeon.”
“Then
get over here and help him. He’s my brother and he can’t die. Do you understand
me?!” he shouted.
“Yes.
I understand.”
“Don’t
try nothing funny, lady, or I’ll put you down.”
I went
over to Noah, checked for a pulse, and then lifted his shirt.
“His
pulse is weak and he’s losing a lot of blood. We need to get him to the
hospital.”
“No!
No hospital. You said you’re a doctor and you’ll fix him up right here!” he
shouted as he waved his gun at me.
“Okay.”
I put my hands up. “But I’m going to need supplies. I need gauze, plastic
tubing, a large water jug, and a knife.”
“A
knife. What the fuck do you need a knife for?”
“I
need to make a chest tube and insert it to drain the blood and fluid from his
chest. If I don’t do this quickly, he will die! I need you to place your hand
on his wound and apply pressure to try and control the bleeding.”
“No
way. I’m not taking my gun off you. You two, go get her what she needs and make
it quick! You, in the purple shirt, get over here and apply pressure to my
brother’s wound!”
With
the supplies they brought me, I made a temporary chest tube, made an incision,
and inserted it, letting the fluid drain into the empty water jug.
“Noah,
stay with me,” I spoke as I checked his pulse again.
“Hurry
up, lady!” the other gunmen spoke. “We need to get the hell out of here.”
“Your
brother cannot be moved. He’s not stable!” I yelled.
“Then
stabilize him!”
Suddenly,
flashing lights and sirens pulled into the parking lot and blocked the entrance
to the market. The gunman looked at me with wide eyes as I quickly stood up and
my phone fell out of my pocket. He looked down at it and saw that 911 was on
the line.
“You
bitch!” he yelled as he fired his gun at me, which sent me flying into a metal
end cap of canned goods.”
I laid
there as I heard more gunshots being fired in the distance. Pain coursed
through my body as I trembled. I was in shock and I could feel myself slipping
away. Before I knew it, two paramedics were kneeling down next to me.
“Oh my
God, it’s Dr. Harper,” I faintly heard one of them say. “Don’t go getting any
ideas, Dr. Harper. You stay with us.”
I was
put on oxygen as one of the paramedics applied pressure to my wound. They
stabilized my neck, but it didn’t stop the pain from radiating through my head.
“My
head,” I tried to mumble.
“We’re
taking you to the hospital now. You’re going to be okay.”
My
life flashed before my eyes like a movie reel and I grew weaker with every
second that passed. Everything went black.
****
Jamieson
I was
checking up on a patient when my pager went off. I looked at it and it was from
Renata.
“ER.
911 911 911. GRACE.”
A
sickness fell upon me as I ran out of my patient’s room and down four flights
of stairs to the ER.
“Where
is she? What happened?” I asked Renata in a panicked tone.
“The
ambulance is five minutes out. Jamieson, I need you to take in a deep breath.”
“Don’t
fucking tell me to take in a deep breath. Tell me what happened!” I shouted in
anger.
“There
was a shooting at a market and Grace was there. She’s been shot, Jamieson.”
I ran
outside to wait for the ambulance along with the other doctors that were also
waiting. One ambulance pulled up and I ran and opened the door.
“Dr.
Grace Harper, gunshot wound to the abdomen and suspected head injury. BP 90/60
and pulse in the 130s. She lost consciousness on the way here and we had to intubate
her in the field,” one of the paramedics spoke.
“Grace,
can you hear me?” I asked as I leaned over her and rubbed her forehead with my
thumb. “Get her into Trauma one!”
I
examined her eyes with my light and let out a deep breath when I saw her pupils
were reactive.
“Dr.
Finn, you need to step away,” Renata spoke.
“How
is the wound?” I asked Dr. Windemere, the attending on call.
“Her
abdomen is distended. There’s blood in her belly. By the looks of this
ultrasound, the bullet is right there in the upper right quadrant. We need to
get her to the OR now.”
“She’s
stable enough for a head CT,” I spoke. “Let’s get that first and then get her into
the OR.”
“Dr.
Finn,” Renata spoke abruptly. “I said step away from the patient.”
“The
hell I will!” I spoke through gritted teeth. “If she has a brain bleed, which
so far everything is pointing to that, I’m operating. I love this woman,
Renata. She is my life and I’m not going to stand by and watch. If you have a
problem with that, then you can fire me after the fact. Let’s go!” I shouted to
Dr. Windemere and the nurses in the room.
We
raced her up to the CT room and I impatiently waited for her scans to load.
“Let’s
get her to the OR now!” I spoke as I saw the bleeding and pressure build-up in
her brain. After scrubbing in, I leaned over her while she lay on the table and
kissed her forehead through my mask. “I love you, Grace. Don’t give up on me.
Please. Fight with everything you have.”
The
pressure build-up in her skull was bad, but I was able to relieve it and stop
the bleed in time before any additional damage could occur. Dr. Windemere stopped
her internal bleeding, removed the bullet, and Grace was stabilized. We took
her up to the CCU, where I wouldn’t leave her side.
“I
called her Aunt Cora. She’s taking the next flight out,” Renata spoke. “How is
she?” she asked as she walked into the room.
“She’s
stable but critical for the next twenty-four hours. I want to speak to the
paramedics that brought her in.”
“They’re
downstairs,” Renata spoke.
“Then
send them up. I’m not leaving her.”
“You
wanted to see us, Dr. Finn?” one of the paramedics spoke. “How is Dr. Harper?”
“She’s
critical, but I think she’ll be okay. Do you by any chance know what happened
and how she hit her head?”
“The
officers at the scene said that one gunman was shot by Billy, the officer that
was in the store at the time of the robbery. I guess Billy fired his gun after
he went down and shot one of the gunmen. It was the guy’s brother. Grace tried
to help him. She made a chest tube and inserted it. She also dialed 911 and
placed the phone in her pocket. When the cops came, the other gunman shot her.
We found her lying against a metal shelf that had collapsed when she hit it.”
“And
the gunman who shot her?”
“He’s down
in ER. One of the police officers shot him in the leg.”
“Thank
you.”
Rage
overtook me as I went down and found Jackie.
“Which
one shot Grace?” I asked in anger.
“Dr.
Finn, don’t.”
I went
from room to room, looking for a gunshot victim. He wasn’t hard to find, since
the ER wasn’t busy, and John, the cop whom Grace saved, was standing outside
his room. I looked at him and he nodded.
“You
son of a bitch.” I walked over to the guy and grabbed him by his gown.
“What
the hell, man! Ouch. My leg!”
“You
shot the woman I love, and for what? A few hundred dollars.”
“She
called the cops.”
“And
she saved your brother,” I spoke angrily through gritted teeth.
“Whoa,
Jamieson,” Logan spoke as he grabbed me and pulled me off the guy. “Stop.”
“Dude,
you’re crazy. Get this asshole away from me!” the man spoke.
“I’m
going to make sure you rot in prison.” I pointed at him.
“Jamieson,
enough,” Logan spoke. “Grace wouldn’t want you to do this.”
I
shook loose from his grip and walked out of the room.







Chapter Fifty-One

Grace
I
slowly opened my eyes and saw Jamieson asleep with his head buried in my arm
and his hand holding mine.
“Dr.
Harper,” Dr. Lasher spoke. “Dr. Finn, she’s awake.”
Jamieson
lifted his head and looked at me.
“Thank
God. Do you remember what happened?” he asked.
“I was
at the market,” I sleepily spoke as I lifted my hand and felt the bandage
around my head.
Shit. I must have had a brain
bleed.
“That’s
right, and you were shot.”
“I
remember now. What are you doing here?” I asked him.
“Why
wouldn’t I be?”
“Go
away,” I spoke as I turned my head away from him.
“Grace.”
“I
said go away. I don’t want to see you. Dr. Lasher, get him out of here!” I
shouted.
“Dr.
Finn. Please. Just give her some time. We can’t let her get all worked up.”
****
The
next morning, I was lying there looking out the window, when Jamieson walked
in.
“I
know you don’t want to see me, but I operated on you and I need to do a post-op
check.”
“How
did Renata allow that?” I asked.
“I
didn’t give her a choice.”
He
flashed the light in my eyes and then told me to follow his finger back and
forth.
“How
are you feeling?”
“Not
real good. I’m in some pain.”
“Then
I’ll up your pain meds. You had a pretty bad brain bleed. I finally got to see
that beautiful brain of yours, and let me tell you, it’s one hell of a brain.”
He smiled.
“Jamieson,
don’t.”
“Listen,
Grace. I’m sorry and you’re going to lie there and listen to what I have to
say. I was going to come over that night after I finished my surgery to talk to
you and to tell you that I can’t live without you.”
“You’re
a little too late. You should have known that the day you wanted the annulment
and let me move out.”
“I did
that for a reason, and when I explain, I’m hoping you can understand.”
“I
don’t think I’ll ever understand you.” I looked away.
“Can
you at least try?” he asked. “Please, just hear me out.”
“Fine.
Explain yourself, but it isn’t going to change anything. I’m done with you. You
hurt me so badly. Worse than this gunshot wound did.”
“I
know and I’m sorry.”
“Sorry
is just a word.”
“I
didn’t want us to be married anymore because of the way it happened. It wasn’t
right. And I needed you to move out because I had to make sure that I didn’t
just grow comfortable with you. I love you, Grace. I always have, but I
wouldn’t admit it to myself. I fought like hell to bury the feelings I had for
you. I felt it that night back in New York, but it didn’t matter because I was
never supposed to see you again. Then you show up here, and it scared me. I
needed that time alone to prove to myself that what we had was so real and
special. I know that’s really fucked up. Hell, if it makes you feel better, I
hate myself for doing it and I always will. I will never forgive myself for
hurting you the way I did. When I came home that night and saw all your things
were gone, my world went black. I tried to tell myself that I’d be okay, but I
wasn’t. I was far from it. I have never loved anyone so much in my life. I need
you to believe that. I gave everything great thought from the first night we
met. I don’t believe in natural forces or any of that woohoo stuff, but something
or someone made sure we met and made sure we stayed in each other’s lives. It
wasn’t a coincidence us meeting in New York and then you moving here to Los
Angeles and taking a job in the same hospital. I had been in pain for so long
and you had your issues with Sam, and we both needed each other. I now believe that
there is someone out there that is made for one person, and you, Grace Harper,
are my person. The person I was supposed to fall in love with.”
I
swallowed hard as tears infiltrated my eyes.
“If
you give me the chance, I will redeem myself to you. I want to make everything
that went wrong with us right.”
“I’ll
take everything you said under advisement,” I spoke.
“What?
Seriously?” He cocked his head. “That’s all you have to say?”
“For
now, yes. After everything that happened, you just can’t come in here and
expect me to forgive you so quickly.” 
“Okay.”
He looked at me strangely. “How much time do you need?”
“I’ll
let you know. If you don’t mind, I’m really tired.”
“Of
course. Get some rest.” He leaned over and kissed my forehead.
As
soon as he walked out of the room, my Aunt Cora walked in.
“I
heard every word that man said. Grace, why are you doing that to him? You know
damn well you’re going to take him back. I’ve never heard such sweetness and
sincerity come from a man’s mouth. It’s kind of hard not to forgive him after
that speech.”
“He
needed his time, and now I need mine.”
It was
the middle of the afternoon, and as I was eating lunch, my nurse, Jenna, walked
in holding a dozen red roses in a beautiful crystal vase.
“Look
what came for you.” She smiled.
“They’re
beautiful. Who are they from?”
“Take
one wild guess.” She smirked as she walked out of the room.
A
moment later, she walked back in with a cart and two other nurses followed
behind her pushing carts with roses sitting on them.
“Oh my
God, what is this?” I grinned.
“Fourteen
dozen roses, all in vases for you, Dr. Harper. Here’s the card,” Jenna spoke as
she handed it to me.
I took
the small card out of the envelope and read it.
One dozen red roses for each day we
were apart.
I love you, Grace.
Love forever, Jamieson
“What
the hell?” Renata smiled as she walked into the room. “Let me guess. Jamieson?”
“Yes.
He’s trying to redeem himself to me.”
“If
that man wasn’t such a damn fool to begin with, he wouldn’t have to.”
I
couldn’t help but laugh.
“I love
him, Renata.”
“I
know you do, sweetheart. Sometimes, we just have to forgive the jackasses in
our life. No matter how badly they hurt us.” She smirked.







Chapter Fifty-Two

Jamieson
Two
months had passed. Grace forgave me, moved back into my beach house, and we
were living our dream life. But not quite yet. I had a plan, and if I was going
to do it, I needed to do it now because we were running out of time. I brought
in a chef to cook a romantic dinner and had a candlelit table set up on the
rooftop. I told Jackie to make sure Grace was out of that hospital by seven
p.m. and if a trauma came in to make sure someone else took over. I wanted this
night to be special for her without any interruptions. I was up in the bedroom when
I heard the front door open, so I slipped the small box into my pocket and
walked down stairs.
“Hi.”
I smiled as I kissed her lips. “How was your day?”
“It
was good. Are you cooking? It smells delicious in here.”
“Sort
of.” I smirked. “Go get changed and we’ll have dinner. It’s almost ready.”
“Okay.”
She looked at me strangely.
I went
upstairs and waited outside the bedroom for her to change. When she was
finished, I took her hand and led her up to the roof top.
“I
thought we could dine up here tonight,” I spoke.
“Wow.
Look at you getting all fancy with candles.” She smirked.
I
pulled the chair out for her and then took the seat across from her.
“Aren’t
you going to get the food?” she asked with an arched brow.
“No
need. Someone will be bringing it up to us,” I spoke as I poured us each a glass
of wine.
“Jamieson,
what are you doing?” A beautiful smile crossed her lips.
“I
just wanted to do something special for the woman I love, and I thought a
professionally prepared candlelit dinner up on the roof top was nice.”
“It is
very nice. Thank you.”
The
chef brought our dinner and we ate and had great conversation.
“Would
you like to dance with me?” I asked her as I stood up and held out my hand.
“I
would love to, Dr. Finn.” She grinned.
I
grabbed the small black remote, hit the button, and soft music began to play. I
held her in my arms and nothing felt more right.
“I
love you,” I whispered before leaning in and kissing her lips.
“I
love you too.”
We
danced until the song ended, and I took in a deep breath.
“Grace,
thank you for giving me a second chance. I honestly don’t know what I would
have done if you had said no. Actually, I do know what I would have done. I
would have pursued you relentlessly.”
She
let out a light laugh.
“I’m
serious, and I’m serious about us. I don’t ever want to be apart from you
again. My life revolves around making you happy. I never want to see you sad.
If I do, I’ll wipe your tears and I’ll take away your pain. If I see you angry,
I’ll calm you down. If you need help with something, I’ll be right there to
help you. I will always be here for you, Grace. You are my stars on a dark
night. You are my sun during the day, and I love you more than any amount of
words can tell you.”
I
pulled the box out of my pocket and got down on one knee.
“We
didn’t do it right the first time, but we can do it right this time. Will you
do me the honor of marrying me again and becoming Mrs. Jamieson Finn?” I
smiled.
“Jamieson.”
She placed her hand over her mouth. “Yes. I want nothing more than to marry you
again.” Tears filled her eyes.
I took
the ring from the box and placed it on her finger. It was a perfect fit. After
bringing her hand to my lips. I stood, picked her up, and swung her around.
“I
love you, Grace.”
“I
love you, Jamieson.”
****
Grace
After
we made love and celebrated our engagement, Jamieson held my hand and softly
stroked my ring.
“There’s
something I want and I’m hoping you’ll say yes,” he spoke.
“What
it is?” I lifted my head from his chest.
“I
want us to get married on your birthday. Now, before you shoot the idea down,
just hear me out. I know that day is something awful for you. Your parents died,
and we drunkenly got married. I know you don’t celebrate that day, and with
good reason, but I want to turn that all around for you. I want you to
celebrate again and I want it to be special. Your parents wouldn’t have wanted
you to stop celebrating your birthday every year. I want us to become husband
and wife on that day and celebrate it every year. I want to celebrate us, and I
want to celebrate you. I love you, Grace, and I don’t want your birthday to
come around every year and you’re too afraid to acknowledge it. I know it’s a
bad memory, but let’s make a new memory. A beautiful one.” I smiled.
“Wow.
I can’t believe you,” I spoke as tears filled my eyes.
“As in
I’m asking a bad thing?” he nervously asked.
“No. Not
at all. I love everything you just said, and I would love to become your wife
on my birthday again.” I softly smiled.
He let
out a deep breath.
“Oh my
God, I was so nervous to ask you. You really mean it?”
“Yes.
I really mean it.” I reached up and kissed his lips. “Thank you.”
“No.
Thank you. We have four months to plan a grand wedding, so we better get
started.”
****
One
Year Later
“Page
Dr. Finn,” I spoke.
“Wait,
you are Dr. Finn.”
“My husband,”
I spoke with irritation to my new intern.
“Oh
right,” he spoke.
I
placed my hand on my belly and took in a deep breath.
“Are
you okay, Dr. Finn?” Dr. Lasher asked.
“I’m
fine. His abdomen is distended, and I can’t see much with this ultrasound. I’m
going to need to do a laparotomy.”
“You paged
me?” Jamieson asked as he walked into the room.
“Gunshot
wound to the upper left quadrant. X-ray is showing the bullet is lodged in his
spinal cord.” I pointed as I held the X-ray up.
“Let’s
get him to the OR,” Jamieson spoke.
As we
were scrubbing in, Jamieson glanced over at me.
“Are
you okay, babe?”
“I’m
fine. Why?”
“You
look like you’re uncomfortable.”
“I’m
nine months pregnant. My back hurts, my feet are swollen, and my legs feel like
I’m carrying an elephant. So yeah, I’m a little uncomfortable.”
“Did
you just refer to our daughter as an elephant?” His brow arched.
“Oops.”
I bit down on my bottom lip.
As I
was walking into the OR, I felt a sharp pain again. The same pain I’d been
experiencing all day. I ignored it because I had a patient to save. Both
Jamieson and I operated together. I stopped the bleeding and as I began to
repair the tear in his liver, Jamieson went in and began to remove the bullet.
“Oh
shit,” I said to myself as I took in a deep breath.
“Umm.
Dr. Finn, I think your water just broke,” Amy the scrub nurse spoke.
“What?”
Jamieson looked up at me.
“I’m aware
my water just broke, Amy. Dr. Finn, I’m almost finished repairing his liver. Hurry
up and remove the bullet from this poor guy’s spine.”
“Grace!”
“Jamieson,
do it now!” I spoke through gritted teeth as I doubled over in gut-wrenching
pain.
“Get
her a wheelchair!” he commanded to one of the residents. “Grace, you’re not due
for two more weeks.”
“I
know that. Apparently, your daughter isn’t willing to wait. Fuck!!” I yelled.
“Ron,” I looked over at the anesthesiologist, “do whatever you have to and get me
an epidural now!”
“I
thought you weren’t going to have one,” Jamieson spoke.
“I’ve
suddenly changed my mind.” I gritted my teeth.
“The
bullet is out. Dr. Carter, do the closing so I can get my wife up to labor and
delivery.”
“Sure
thing, Dr. Finn. Good luck to both of you.” He smiled.
Jamieson
wheeled me out of the OR, and suddenly, I felt something.
“I
have to push, Jamieson, and I have to push now.”
He
stopped the wheelchair and looked at me.
“Grace,
no. You have to wait until I get you to labor and delivery.”
“I
can’t. What are you going to do, push the wheelchair down the stairs? I can’t
wait for the elevator!” I shouted.
“Jesus.
Umm. Okay.” He grabbed a nurse and wheeled me into a room. “Page Dr. Edmonds
stat and tell her we’re up here and she needs to come now. Page Jackie down in
the ER and tell her the baby is coming.”
He
helped me from the wheelchair and onto the bed. One of the nurses on the
surgical floor ran in with a gown and quickly helped me into it.
“I
have to push, Jamieson. OH MY GOD!” I yelled as I gripped the sides of the bed.
“Where’s
Doctor Edmonds?” he shouted.
“She’s
delivering a baby at the moment. She said she’ll be here as soon as she can,”
the nurse spoke. “We have fetal monitors on this floor. I’ll go grab one.”
“Okay,
Grace. Let me see what’s going on down there,” Jamieson spoke. “Whatever you
do, don’t push yet.”
“Easy for
you to say!”
“I’m
here. I’m here.” Jackie ran into the room.
“You’re
dilated to ten, baby. I can see her head.” Jamieson smiled as he looked up at
me.
“It’s
okay. Push,” Jackie spoke as she held my hand and held me up.
I
pushed as hard as I could and let out a howl.
“She’s
coming, Grace. Give me another push.”
“AH!”
I screamed as I pushed again.
“One
more, baby,” Jamieson spoke.
“I
can’t. I’m exhausted.” I lay back on the bed. “Just go up there and pull her
out or something.”
“You
only pushed a couple times. How are you exhausted already?” Jamieson asked.
Was he serious right now?
“I
just worked seventeen hours straight, you idiot!” I shouted as I sat up and
pushed as hard as I could.
Suddenly,
I heard my baby cry.
“She’s
here, Grace, and she’s beautiful.” Jamieson smiled with tears in his eyes.
He cut
the cord and then placed her on my belly so I could touch her. After a few
moments, he handed her over to Jackie so she could be cleaned up. A few minutes
later, Dr. Edmonds walked in the room.
“I’m
here. Wow. I guess I’m a little late. Congratulations, you two.” She smiled as
she walked over to me and began massaging my belly.
Jackie
wrapped my daughter in a blanket and placed her in my arms. Jamieson kissed my
forehead and told me how much he loved me.
“I
love you too.”
“She
looks like you,” he spoke.
“She
has your lips. Lucky girl.” I smiled.
“Do we
have a name?” Jackie asked.
I
looked at Jamieson as he placed his finger in his daughter’s hand.
“Ava
Nicole Finn,” he spoke.
“A
beautiful name for a future doctor.” Jackie smiled. “By the way, Dr. Finn.
Happy birthday. I bet you didn’t expect this.”
“No.
Not at all. I can’t believe I delivered my own daughter on my birthday. This is
the best birthday present anyone has ever given me.” He kissed my lips.
“Happy
birthday, my love.” I softly stroked his cheek.







Epilogue

Five
Years Later
Jamieson
“And
what’s this?” I asked Ava.
“The
cerebrum, Daddy.”
“And
what does it do?”
“It’s
the largest part of the brain and it has two hemispheres. A right and a left.”
“That’s
my girl.” I kissed her head.
“And
what is this right here?” I pointed to the monitor.
“That’s
a brain tumor. A beautiful big brain tumor.” She smiled.
“And
where is it located.”
“The
frontal lobe.”
“You
are a genius, my love.”
“Really,
Jamieson? She’s five. Do you think it’s wise to teach her about brain tumors?”
Grace asked as she walked into the neuro room.
“You’re
never too young to learn about brain tumors, Grace. She’s a genius like us.
Ava, tell Mommy what your life plan is.”
“I’m
going to Harvard and I’m going to become a world class neurosurgeon like my
daddy.” She smiled as she folded her arms.
“What?”
he asked as I narrowed my eye at him. “You can teach our son all about trauma
if you want. Wait, maybe he’ll be a brilliant neurosurgeon too and then he and
Ava can work together. A brother and sister team.” He grinned. “You can teach
trauma to the next one.”
“The next
one? I haven’t even had this one yet and you’re already talking about another
one?”
“Daddy,
I want to see more brain tumors.”
“Of
course you do, sweetheart.” I kissed her head as I winked at Grace. “Go look at
that monitor over there and see if you can spot the brain tumor while I talk to
Mommy.”
“Okay,
Daddy.”
I
walked over to Grace and wrapped my arms around her.
“I
love you, Dr. Finn.”
“I
love you too, Dr. Finn.”
My
life was perfect. I had a beautiful wife, a beautiful daughter, and a son on
the way. I never thought my life would turn out the way it had. I envisioned
myself being alone, because that was how I wanted it, until Grace walked into
my life. She turned my world upside down and I hadn’t been the same since. She
was the bright side of my life, and the best thing that had ever happened to
me. I redeemed myself and I was rewarded in ways I never thought possible.
Redemption is just not about the
survival of our soul.
It’s about the revival of a soul
that was once dead.
