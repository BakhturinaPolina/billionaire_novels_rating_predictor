7075	7083	7084	7084	He	68	“ Ah , come on , babe . ”
7129	7139	7140	7140	I	0	“ This is what you wanted to show me ? ”

7460	7470	7471	7471	His	68	“ See ? I thought you ’d like it . ”
7486	7493	7471	7471	His	68	“ It ’ll only get better . ”
7494	7501	7502	7502	I	0	“ Why are you like this ? ”
7535	7539	7523	7523	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
7540	7551	7576	7576	he	68	“ Decent when I want nothing to do with you . ”
7552	7575	7576	7576	he	68	“ Hate and love are easy emotions to feel . They ’re powerful . It ’s indifference you have to fight for , ”
7589	7610	7576	7576	he	68	“ Not caring about someone would mean forgetting them , and we both know that neither of us are forgettable . ”
7673	7681	7682	7682	I	0	“ I wish I could forget you , ”
7731	7738	7725	7725	he	68	“ No , you do n’t . ”
7891	7899	7900	7900	Austin	68	“ You have that look about you , ”
7932	7936	7925	7925	he	68	“ What look ? ”
7937	7952	7925	7925	he	68	“ Like you ’re going to draw me like one of your French girls . ”
7953	7966	7925	7925	he	68	“ Ugh ! I regret the day I showed you my drawings . ”
7967	7975	7925	7925	he	68	“ Why ? You ’re an artist . ”
7976	7983	7984	7984	I	0	“ I am not an artist , ”
7991	8022	7984	7984	I	0	“ That ’s reserved for people who , one , have any talent and , two , are professionals . I sometimes draw on the side when the mood strikes . ”
8023	8028	7925	7925	he	68	“ Like right now ? ”
8029	8032	7984	7984	I	0	“ Maybe . ”
8033	8038	8039	8039	he	382	“ I knew it , ”
8044	8053	8039	8039	he	382	“ I thought the sunset would do it . ”
8059	8066	8054	8054	I	0	“ How did you know that ? ”
8067	8073	8074	8074	he	382	“ You like beautiful things , ”
8089	8094	8095	8095	I	0	“ Whatever , Austin . ”
8312	8315	8316	8316	I	0	“ Jules ? ”
8325	8329	8316	8316	I	0	“ I said — ”
8330	8339	8359	8359	His	68	“ Right . Fuck . Habits , babe . ”
8340	8352	8353	8353	I	0	“ Why the fuck am I even here you with you ? ”
8373	8378	8359	8359	His	68	“ You know why . ”
8379	8384	8385	8385	He	68	“ Honestly , no . ”
8549	8552	8553	8553	I	0	“ Stop , ”
8645	8650	8629	8629	Austin	68	“ What the hell ? ”
8651	8663	8664	8664	I	0	“ Is this the only reason you brought me up here ? ”
8706	8714	8715	8715	he	68	“ So , what if it was ? ”
8718	8724	8715	8715	he	68	“ You seemed plenty willing . ”
8725	8742	8677	8677	Austin	68	“ Yeah , plenty willing . Even though I told you not to fucking touch me . ”
8743	8752	8715	8715	he	68	“ Right . As if you were serious . ”
8753	8759	8715	8715	he	68	“ Fuck , I was ! ”
8760	8777	8715	8715	he	68	“ Then , why the hell did you come here with me in the first place ? ”
8778	8788	8715	8715	he	68	“ I ’m asking myself the same fucking question . ”
8789	8798	8799	8799	Austin	68	“ Sometimes , you really make no sense , ”
8822	8831	8816	8816	he	68	“ It ’s not hard to respect boundaries . ”
8832	8835	8836	8836	he	68	“ Boundaries ? ”
8844	8857	8836	8836	he	68	“ You have been eye - fucking me since you got here . ”
8858	8868	8869	8869	His	68	“ You ’re mistaking my scowl for sexual attraction . ”
8874	8878	8869	8869	His	68	“ Am I ? ”
8879	8882	8883	8883	I	0	“ Yes . ”
8893	8914	8883	8883	I	0	“ You ’re right . Why the fuck would I think to bring you up to Make - Out Point ? ”
8915	8918	8919	8919	I	0	“ What ? ”
8922	8935	8936	8936	he	68	“ Where did you think we were ? An abandoned parking lot ? ”
8960	8975	8936	8936	he	68	“ After the sun has set , this place will be crawling with teens . ”
9022	9034	9011	9011	He	68	“ You really are disgusting . You know that , right ? ”
9035	9048	9049	9049	Austin	68	“ And here I thought , I was doing you a favor , ”
9059	9067	9053	9053	his	68	“ I thought you wanted a rebound . ”
9068	9087	9088	9088	I	0	“ I want nothing to do with you , but thank you for reminding me of that fact , ”
9136	9144	9145	9145	he	68	“ Do n’t storm out of here , ”
9148	9154	9145	9145	he	68	“ Fuck off , Austin . ”
9168	9206	9155	9155	I	0	“ I might want a rebound . Something fun and light and easy . Something to take my mind off of things . But you ’re an idiot if you think that I want that from you . ”
9207	9216	9217	9217	he	68	“ Who do you want it from then ? ”
9242	9245	9227	9227	I	0	“ Patrick . ”
9288	9291	9292	9292	he	68	“ Patrick , ”
9295	9305	9292	9292	he	68	“ Yeah . Have something to say about that ? ”
9357	9363	9344	9344	I	0	“ Good luck with that . ”
9364	9377	9344	9344	I	0	“ I ’m getting out of here . You drive me crazy . ”
9378	9384	9385	9385	I	0	“ The feeling is mutual . ”
9972	9976	9977	9977	he	72	“ Quick trip ? ”
9992	10001	10002	10002	Patrick	72	“ You should probably go get your boy . ”
10019	10027	10004	10004	his	72	“ He ’s not in the truck ? ”
10028	10036	10037	10037	I	0	“ Does it look like he is ? ”
10070	10081	10082	10082	He	72	“ Oh , man . Fuck . I needed that . ”
10087	10094	10084	10084	his	72	“ You actually left him somewhere ? ”
10095	10101	10102	10102	Heidi	65	“ Left who ? Where ? ”
10132	10135	10136	10136	Patrick	72	“ Austin , ”
10139	10147	10136	10136	Patrick	72	“ Somewhere called Make - Out Point , ”
10158	10163	10152	10152	Heidi	65	“ He did n’t . ”
10164	10170	10171	10171	I	0	“ Oh , he did , ”
10174	10184	10185	10185	Patrick	72	“ I guess I ’d better go get him , ”
10194	10197	10191	10191	his	72	“ Idiot . ”
10198	10205	10211	10211	him	72	“ You can say that again . ”
10288	10295	10274	10274	Heidi	65	“ Want to talk about it ? ”
10296	10299	10300	10300	I	0	“ No , ”
10309	10324	10300	10300	I	0	“ This was a mistake . I did n’t mean for this to happen . ”
10325	10352	10302	10302	her	65	“ This is not your fault . This is Austin fucking Wright thinking that , just because I ’m single , I want to fuck him . ”
10353	10357	10358	10358	Heidi	65	“ Do you ? ”
10377	10380	10361	10361	I	0	“ No ! ”
10381	10387	10388	10388	I	0	“ Not even a little ? ”

10438	10448	10415	10415	Austin	68	“ Yeah . You two have this … thing . ”
10449	10453	10454	10454	Heidi	65	“ What thing ? ”
10457	10476	10454	10454	Heidi	65	“ I do n’t know . It ’s like the air gets thicker when you two are together . ”
10477	10483	10415	10415	Austin	68	“ The air gets thicker ? ”
10484	10491	10492	10492	She	65	“ You know what I mean . ”
10499	10528	10492	10492	She	65	“ You two have chemistry . It ’s hard to ignore . But that does n’t mean he ’s for you if you do n’t want that chemistry . ”
10529	10533	10534	10534	I	0	“ I want … ”
10545	10550	10551	10551	Heidi	65	“ Nice and normal ? ”
10554	10562	10551	10551	Heidi	65	“ Like that worked out last time . ”
10563	10572	10573	10573	I	0	“ You ’ll find someone . I promise . ”
10586	10594	10595	10595	Heidi	65	“ I told him I wanted Patrick . ”
10602	10610	10595	10595	Heidi	65	“ Now , that ’s just mean . ”
10611	10618	10595	10595	Heidi	65	“ I wanted to be mean . ”
10619	10625	10595	10595	Heidi	65	“ How did he react ? ”
10626	10642	10643	10643	Heidi	65	“ He acted like he did n’t care . He acts like that about everything . ”
10646	10662	10643	10643	Heidi	65	“ Are you ever going to tell me the real reason you two broke up ? ”
10663	10671	10672	10672	I	0	“ Look , I already told you , ”
10679	10729	10672	10672	I	0	“ He used me and then dumped me . I do n’t want to go back to a guy who did that to me . I do n’t ever want to be used . I really do n’t ever want a guy who makes me feel like Austin does . ”
10730	10738	10643	10643	Heidi	65	“ Is n’t that half the fun ? ”
10739	10742	10743	10743	I	0	“ Sure , ”
10751	10800	10743	10743	I	0	“ It ’s loads of fun . And then reality sets in . Austin is like taking a hit of cocaine and riding out the high . You feel fucking fabulous while you ’re on it , but then you hit rock bottom . And it fucking sucks . ”
10803	10806	10807	10807	I	0	“ Fuck ! ”
11267	11273	11265	11265	Patrick	72	“ Took you long enough . ”
11274	11286	11287	11287	Patrick	72	“ What the fuck have you gotten yourself into this time ? ”
11290	11297	11287	11287	Patrick	72	“ Nothing . She went crazy . ”
11298	11320	11321	11321	I	0	“ You brought her to a make - out spot , you dipshit . How did you think she ’d react ? ”
11324	11330	11321	11321	I	0	“ She seemed into it . ”
11331	11337	11354	11354	he	72	“ Until you told her ? ”
11338	11341	11342	11342	Patrick	72	“ Maybe . ”
11363	11393	11344	11344	his	72	“ You and me , Austin , we ’re brothers . I get you . But do n’t be stupid about Julia , or she ’ll find someone else . ”
11394	11402	11403	11403	Curiosity	85	“ Why ? Did she say something ? ”
11430	11440	11441	11441	Patrick	72	“ Besides telling me to get you ? No . ”
11449	11452	11441	11441	Patrick	72	“ Why ? ”
11453	11457	11458	11458	I	0	“ Never mind . ”
11593	11598	11599	11599	she	78	“ Were you driving ? ”

11649	11657	11658	11658	she	78	“ Are you out of your mind ? ”
11661	11667	11658	11658	she	78	“ You have been drinking ! ”
11668	11674	11675	11675	Patrick	72	“ Chill out , Mor . ”
11683	11705	11677	11677	his	72	“ I did n’t drink with dinner , and I was n’t drunk to begin with . It ’s all good . ”
11706	11710	11711	11711	she	78	“ All good ? ”
11720	11741	11717	11717	her	78	“ You were driving down canyon cliffs ! You could have gotten hurt , or worse , hurt someone else . ”
11742	11758	11759	11759	He	72	“ I appreciate the worry , but as you can see , we ’re fine . ”
11800	11805	11806	11806	she	78	“ Right . Fine , ”
11881	11888	11889	11889	Morgan	78	“ Hey , hey , hey , ”
11897	11917	11889	11889	Morgan	78	“ I ’m fine . Nothing happened . All is well . Feel free to yell at someone else . ”
11918	11928	11929	11929	She	78	“ I was n’t going to yell at you . ”
11938	11948	11931	11931	her	78	“ Family meeting . We were waiting for you . ”
11949	11955	11956	11956	I	0	“ What ’s it about ? ”
11963	11983	11959	11959	I	0	“ You ’ll find out with everyone else . But get ready ; it ’s pretty kick - ass . ”
11990	12000	11984	11984	I	0	“ Oh , good , you ’re not pregnant . ”
12006	12016	12003	12003	her	78	“ Who do you think I am ? Sutton ? ”
12017	12020	12003	12003	her	78	“ Hey ! ”
12030	12035	12003	12003	her	78	“ I heard that . ”
12171	12177	12178	12178	Morgan	78	“ You were supposed to , ”
12181	12193	12194	12194	She	78	“ Y’all can keep being jealous of my awesome fucking life . ”
12252	12259	12260	12260	Morgan	78	“ She ’s got me there , ”
12263	12272	12260	12260	Morgan	78	“ I ’ve got an awesome fucking life . ”
12276	12286	12273	12273	Morgan	78	“ Yeah , I bet you do , Austin . ”
12397	12405	12406	12406	Sutton	88	“ Is this going to take long ? ”
12409	12415	12416	12416	Jensen	73	“ Have somewhere to be ? ”
12423	12429	12420	12420	his	73	“ Besides enjoying my vacation ? ”
12430	12437	12438	12438	Morgan	78	“ You do n’t even work , ”
12442	12456	12457	12457	Sutton	88	“ Um … hello ? I have a one - year - old , ”
12472	12479	12480	12480	Landon	66	“ It wo n’t take long , ”
12483	12493	12494	12494	Morgan	78	“ You do n’t even know what it is , ”
12500	12539	12497	12497	Landon	66	“ We ca n’t all be in the same room together without ripping out each other ’s throats . So , I ’m assuming Jensen is having this meeting for a reason and will get on with it . ”
12558	12568	12569	12569	Sutton	88	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re enabling him , ”
12574	12580	12581	12581	I	0	“ Not you , too , ”
12602	12610	12611	12611	Sutton	88	“ Can the meeting be about that ? ”
12614	12638	12611	12611	Sutton	88	“ I ’m supposed to be the party animal . I ’m the age to constantly be fucked up . You’re … not . ”
12639	12665	12666	12666	Sutton	88	“ Yet you ’re the one with a kid , and I ’m not . Seems to have worked out better for me than you . ”
12671	12702	12666	12666	Sutton	88	“ Austin , I might be little and not give a shit about a lot of stuff , but if you insult me again , I will kick your ass . ”
12703	12706	12707	12707	Jensen	73	“ Enough , ”
12724	12739	12710	12710	He	73	“ I love you all , but can we have peace for five minutes ? ”
12794	12800	12801	12801	Jensen	73	“ Are we all done ? ”
12804	12811	12812	12812	Landon	66	“ Can I ask a question ? ”
12835	12840	12826	12826	Jensen	73	“ What is it ? ”

12932	12939	12940	12940	Jensen	73	“ Could we all please stop ? ”
12947	12956	12940	12940	Jensen	73	“ Emery and I are not getting married . ”
12957	12965	12966	12966	Landon	66	“ This seems like an egregious oversight , ”
12969	12983	12984	12984	Jensen	73	“ Just because you rush into things does n’t mean that I do , ”
12987	13029	12984	12984	Jensen	73	“ Marriage and … babies are high on your priority list . I ’ve already done both of those things and … not that I need to explain that to any of you , but Emery and I want to wait . ”
13030	13041	13042	13042	I	0	“ Well , can we cut to the chase then ? ”
13045	13052	13053	13053	Morgan	78	“ Yes . Back on track , ”
13061	13078	13079	13079	Jensen	73	“ The real reason we ’re here today has nothing to do with my marital status , ”
13082	13096	13079	13079	Jensen	73	“ It ’s because … I’m stepping down as CEO of Wright Construction . ”
13257	13260	13287	13287	he	66	“ What ? ”
13266	13271	13261	13261	Sutton	88	“ What the fuck ? ”
13272	13279	13280	13280	Landon	66	“ Yeah . What she said , ”
13325	13338	13339	13339	Jensen	73	“ I know this might come as a shock to you all , ”
13342	13345	13346	13346	I	0	“ Understatement , ”

As you know , I studied architecture in college and worked in New York for some time , focused on that . It was n’t what … our dad wanted from me , but it was what I loved . After much consideration , I ’ve decided that I should follow my dreams and work in architecture again . I might be good at what I do , but I do n’t love it , like when I was designing and building things . It is n’t the same . ”

20824	20830	20862	20862	she	78	“ Um … guilty pleasure ? ”
20831	20848	20849	20849	she	78	“ Great . We ’re going to be best friends . Can we get matching tattoos ? ”

21387	21390	21391	21391	Austin	68	“ Cool , ”

21785	21839	21840	21840	I	0	“ Really ? Because I think I just got you more time to look at all the art you ’re dying to see . Otherwise , you would have been dragged away to see drunks singing Bon Jovi and Journey at the tops of their lungs . A simple thank you would suffice . ”

22223	22271	22272	22272	He	72	“ They ’re supposed to draw something that inspires them . I hate that there are so many kids in Lubbock without a forever home , but I ’m glad we have programs like this that help kids in need by getting donations from the local community . ”

22764	22780	22761	22761	Patrick	72	“ We did a couple of shots . She was fine before you got here . ”

23076	23110	23111	23111	She	86	“ A date . You , me , together . I ’ll pick you up . We ’ll do normal human things instead of running into each other over and over on accident . ”
23135	23143	23144	23144	she	86	“ Are you out of your mind ? ”
23150	23157	23144	23144	she	86	“ Not that I know of . ”
23158	23161	23162	23162	she	86	“ Austin , ”
23165	23179	23162	23162	she	86	“ We tried this . We broke up . We ’re awful together . ”
23180	23186	23187	23187	She	86	“ Maybe things have changed . ”
23190	23195	23187	23187	She	86	“ They have n’t . ”
23196	23206	23162	23162	she	86	“ Sometimes , I really do n’t get you . ”
23207	23210	23211	23211	she	86	“ Sometimes ? ”
23229	23264	23217	23217	She	86	“ I ’m pretty sure you never got me . Ever ! If you understood me at all , then we would n’t have gone through the shit we went through two years ago . ”
23291	23346	23280	23280	she	86	“ I do get you , Jules . I get you better than anyone you ’ve ever met . I see you . I know you . And that ’s why this did n’t work . You can blame me all you want , but the truth is that you wo n’t open up . ”
23347	23354	23355	23355	Her	86	“ I wo n’t open up ? ”
23362	23378	23355	23355	Her	86	“ You think that ’s the reason ? So , you ’re blind and stupid . ”
23379	23400	23401	23401	I	0	“ I think that you ’d rather have someone safe in your back pocket than have someone who challenges you . ”
23423	23496	23497	23497	She	86	“ And you think that you ’re a bright ray of sunshine ? You ’re completely open and honest ? What happened Memorial Day weekend , Austin ? Why did n’t you tell me about the CFO position ? You had the opportunity , and you fucking choked . You might think that I ca n’t open up , but if that ’s the truth , then you ’re just as bad . ”
23612	23620	23621	23621	I	0	“ The board did n’t approve me , ”
23646	23650	23651	23651	I	0	“ This fast ? ”
23654	23681	23651	23651	I	0	“ Jensen put my name up for CFO when he moved Morgan up to his job . The board had some … concerns about my behavior . ”
23682	23708	23709	23709	I	0	“ That should n’t be reason enough not to give you the job . You ’re a Wright . Maybe they ’ll change their minds . ”
23725	23751	23752	23752	Julia	86	“ No . Jensen accused me of being an alcoholic and said that I had to go to rehab before they ’d even consider it . ”
23821	23829	23830	23830	Julia	86	“ Maybe you should listen to him , ”
23887	23896	23897	23897	she	86	“ Why the hell did you storm off ? ”
23917	23928	23929	23929	I	0	“ Why the hell are you following me , Jules ? ”
24023	24032	24033	24033	I	0	“ You just up and left without explanation . ”
24051	24062	24063	24063	I	0	“ You do n’t want to go out with me , ”
24066	24116	24063	24063	I	0	“ You do n’t want to have anything to do with me . You abandoned me on the top of the canyon a week ago and said that all we did was argue . So , if you do n’t want this , then leave me the fuck alone . ”
24117	24137	24138	24138	she	86	“ Excuse me for trying to find out why you ’re not getting a job I think you deserve , ”
24144	24151	24138	24138	she	86	“ I guess I was wrong . ”
24152	24162	24163	24163	She	86	“ What I deserve has never mattered to anyone . ”
24245	24254	24255	24255	I	0	“ Oh , I ’ve missed that look , ”
24268	24272	24255	24255	I	0	“ What look ? ”
24293	24302	24273	24273	Her	86	“ The one begging me to fuck you . ”
24311	24322	24303	24303	I	0	“ Do you want me to fuck you , Jules ? ”
24335	24338	24339	24339	she	86	“ No , ”
24345	24349	24350	24350	She	86	“ You sure ? ”
24353	24356	24350	24350	She	86	“ No . ”
24357	24367	24323	24323	She	86	“ That ’s right . I know you do . ”
24368	24377	24378	24378	she	86	“ You do n’t know anything about me , ”
24381	24401	24378	24378	she	86	“ I know that your body is craving mine , like an addict in need of her next fix . ”
24405	24417	24402	24402	Julia	86	“ You ’d know all about that , would n’t you ? ”
24418	24425	24426	24426	I	0	“ I do n’t do drugs , ”
24431	24436	24426	24426	I	0	“ And alcohol is … ”
24437	24440	24402	24402	Julia	86	“ Different . ”
24441	24444	24445	24445	she	86	“ Bullshit , ”
24452	24483	24445	24445	she	86	“ You talk about all the other addictions out there — drugs , sex , money — yet you wo n’t own up to your own . It ’s pathetic . ”
24484	24500	24501	24501	I	0	“ What ’s pathetic is that you ’ll use any excuse to argue with me . ”
24512	24521	24501	24501	I	0	“ Any excuse to put distance between us . ”
24522	24529	24445	24445	she	86	“ Sex was never our problem ! ”
24530	24540	24501	24501	I	0	“ Then , why are n’t we having it ? ”
24541	24548	24549	24549	she	86	“ Because you are the problem , ”
24558	24564	24549	24549	she	86	“ Keep telling yourself that . ”
24599	24607	24608	24608	Julia	86	“ Where the hell are you going ? ”
24613	24623	24608	24608	Julia	86	“ Finding someone who wants to suck my dick , ”
24745	24752	24753	24753	I	0	“ Go on inside , Jules , ”

25299	25304	25294	25294	She	69	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
25305	25308	25265	25265	she	65	“ Nothing . ”

25352	25357	25358	25358	Heidi	65	“ What ? No ! ”
25361	25376	25358	25358	Heidi	65	“ Come on . Come and dance with us . It ’ll be fun ! ”

25425	25450	25461	25461	She	65	“ No . I told him no . Then , he told me about the CFO position , and we got into another argument . ”
25451	25457	25458	25458	Emery	69	“ You told him no ? ”
25478	25490	25491	25491	Heidi	65	“ Yeah . I do n’t want to date him again . ”

25505	25534	25577	25577	Emery	69	“ He told me he was going to find someone else to suck his dick ! I think I ’m justified in saying that I ’m not interested . ”
25535	25546	25547	25547	Heidi	65	“ He said that because you ’d turned him down , ”
25555	25568	25547	25547	Heidi	65	“ Well , if he wants someone else , by all means . ”
25588	25605	25577	25577	Emery	69	“ Loving a Wright is n’t easy . I ca n’t imagine Austin is any different . ”

25625	25694	25622	25622	her	69	“ That ’s not what I meant . Simply that , if Austin got up the nerve to ask you out after your breakup , after you slapping him in the face last fall , and after you abandoning him on top of the canyon last weekend … he must be into you . No guy puts up with that much shit and sticks around for no reason . ”
25695	25703	25704	25704	I	0	“ Oh , there ’s a reason , ”
25707	25716	25704	25704	I	0	“ He wants to have sex with me . ”

25747	25762	25741	25741	Emery	69	“ Jensen and Landon both jumped through hoops . Wright men love the chase . ”

25791	25802	25803	25803	Heidi	65	“ Well , we do n’t know what actually happened , ”
25846	25857	25858	25858	I	0	“ It does n’t matter . It ’s ancient history , ”
25861	25865	25866	25866	Emery	69	“ All right , ”
25881	25892	25893	25893	I	0	“ Then , yeah … maybe give him another chance . ”
25912	25923	25924	25924	I	0	“ Is this what it ’s like to have girlfriends ? ”
25927	25948	25949	25949	Heidi	65	“ We give you sage advice , and you listen to us wise women who have been where you stand ? ”
25955	25963	25949	25949	Heidi	65	“ Yes , yes , it is . ”
25964	25971	25972	25972	Emery	69	“ Do n’t listen to her , ”
25975	26003	25972	25972	Emery	69	“ Girlfriends are here to cheer you on and commiserate when shit goes down . Also , for Buffy marathons , ice cream dates , and shopping . ”
26004	26019	26020	26020	Heidi	65	“ You mean , force - feeding all my friends colors in their wardrobes ? ”
26540	26561	26533	26533	Heidi	65	“ I still ca n’t get over the fact that Landon used to live here in a tiny one bedroom . ”
26562	26581	26582	26582	Emery	69	“ That does seem crazy , considering where he lives now and the place he had in Clearwater , ”
26585	26596	26597	26597	I	0	“ I ’m glad I opted for the two bedroom , ”
26609	26628	26597	26597	I	0	“ I took one look at the one bedroom and decided I could n’t live in a shoebox . ”
26629	26640	26641	26641	Heidi	65	“ Hey , did you leave your car door open ? ”
26646	26660	26641	26641	Heidi	65	“ My what ? No , why would I leave my door open ? ”
26661	26672	26597	26597	I	0	“ I do n’t know , but it ’s open . ”
26673	26676	26677	26677	I	0	“ Fuck ! ”
26711	26719	26720	26720	she	65	“ Is the window broken or anything ? ”
26739	26746	26734	26734	I	0	“ All the windows are fine . ”
26975	26980	26981	26981	Emery	69	“ Is anything missing ? ”
26988	26996	26981	26981	Emery	69	“ No . Not even my headphones . ”
26997	27002	27003	27003	Heidi	65	“ That ’s lucky , ”
27006	27015	27016	27016	Emery	69	“ Maybe you just left the door open , ”
27019	27024	27016	27016	Emery	69	“ It could happen . ”
27025	27034	27035	27035	Heidi	65	“ Yeah . You were in a hurry , ”
27136	27143	27144	27144	I	0	“ False alarm , I guess , ”
27309	27312	27313	27313	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
27547	27559	27540	27540	Her	746	“ Austin , Christ , do n’t scare me like that ! ”
27560	27567	27540	27540	Her	746	“ Uh … hey , Mindi . ”
27568	27575	27540	27540	Her	746	“ Babe , you look horrible . ”

27701	27719	27720	27720	Mindi	113	“ She ’s out of town , but I figured she ’d appreciate me saving your life , ”
27730	27736	27720	27720	Mindi	113	“ Do you want some ? ”
27748	27759	27760	27760	Mindi	113	“ Like , what do you remember about last night ? ”
27763	27776	27760	27760	Mindi	113	“ Nothing . It ’s a blur . Did we hook up ? ”
27786	27789	27783	27783	She	113	“ Ew . ”
27790	27799	27830	27830	her	113	“ You ’re so good for the ego . ”
27800	27827	27828	27828	She	113	“ I mean … I’d be down if you could convince that golfer brother of yours . You know how I am about brothers , Austin . ”
27835	27847	27828	27828	She	113	“ I ’ll take a pass . Landon is engaged anyway . ”
27855	27865	27848	27848	She	113	“ Shame . Mags would probably gut me anyway . ”
27866	27874	27828	27828	She	113	“ So , why am I here ? ”
27875	27935	27936	27936	I	0	“ You were at the bar , talking to this girl . You were going on and on about this other girl , Jules , who you ’re apparently obsessed with . And something about being an alcoholic and the company . I was getting off my shift and saved you from yourself . So , you ’re welcome . ”
27946	27951	27936	27936	I	0	“ Well , thanks . ”
27952	27969	27970	27970	she	751	“ Anytime . Now … if you could put in a word with Patrick for me , ”

28474	28485	28464	28464	Jensen	73	“ Austin . To what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
28541	28551	28552	28552	I	0	“ I came to talk about the CFO position . ”
28578	28584	28570	28570	Jensen	73	“ You want the job . ”
28585	28593	28594	28594	I	0	“ Well , of course I do , ”
28597	28600	28601	28601	he	73	“ Look , ”
28612	28666	28601	28601	he	73	“ I want to apologize for the conversation that we had over Memorial Day weekend . I was so excited for Morgan and disappointed about what had happened with the board in regard to you . I should n’t have said the things I did . You know I hate when we fight . ”
28670	28682	28667	28667	I	0	“ Yeah , well , maybe I needed to hear it . ”
28691	28695	28688	28688	his	73	“ Come again ? ”
28696	28726	28667	28667	I	0	“ I do n’t know , man . I just think things are n’t going how I expected them . And I did n’t have a drink this morning . ”
28727	28736	28737	28737	I	0	“ When was the last time that happened ? ”
28740	28744	28737	28737	I	0	“ No idea . ”
28745	28764	28667	28667	I	0	“ All right . So , where do we go from here ? How can I help you ? ”
28765	28777	28778	28778	I	0	“ I do n’t want this to be a big thing , ”
28784	28794	28778	28778	I	0	“ Does this have something to do with Julia ? ”
28800	28807	28778	28778	I	0	“ Why would you think that ? ”
28808	28814	28815	28815	he	73	“ I live with Emery , ”
28819	28824	28815	28815	he	73	“ She say something ? ”
28825	28844	28778	28778	I	0	“ She might have mentioned that y’ all ran into each other at the First Friday Art Trail . ”
28845	28866	28778	28778	I	0	“ Yeah , well , Julia wants nothing to do with me . It ’s probably better that way anyway . ”
28867	28875	28876	28876	I	0	“ Who are you trying to convince ? ”
28885	28949	28882	28882	he	73	“ I ’m here for you , no matter why the sudden change of heart . You know that we all worry about you . The last thing we want is for you to spiral and end up like Dad . I ’d hate to see this damage your health and ruin any chance at a normal relationship with a girl like Julia . ”
28950	28966	28967	28967	I	0	“ You really think I ’m far enough gone that I could be like Dad ? ”
28975	29000	28967	28967	I	0	“ If you ’re talking to me about it right now , then no . And I ’d like it to stay that way . ”
29001	29005	28967	28967	I	0	“ All right . ”
29115	29131	29132	29132	Jensen	73	“ Austin , I think we should figure out a course of action from here , ”
29142	29161	29135	29135	I	0	“ I think I ’ll just give it a try on my own . See how it goes . ”
29172	29190	29135	29135	I	0	“ You really think there ’s no chance that the board will look at me for CFO ? ”
29201	29213	29191	29191	Jensen	73	“ It ’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility . ”
29214	29217	29162	29162	Jensen	73	“ But ? ”
29218	29231	29191	29191	Jensen	73	“ But we have already been inundated with applications for the position . ”
29232	29242	29243	29243	Jensen	73	“ Did n’t you just post it on Friday ? ”
29246	29251	29252	29252	I	0	“ Well , fuck , ”
29255	29259	29252	29252	I	0	“ Anyone good ? ”
29260	29264	29265	29265	he	73	“ A couple , ”

29285	29296	29297	29297	I	0	“ David Calloway ? Like , the Silicon Valley guy ? ”
29303	29307	29297	29297	I	0	“ The one . ”
29308	29318	29265	29265	he	73	“ What the hell does he want with us ? ”
29319	29339	29340	29340	Jensen	73	“ A Fortune 500 would be a step up for him . He brings a lot to the table , ”
29343	29355	29356	29356	Jensen	73	“ Shit . Where have I heard of Elizabeth Leyton before ? ”
29359	29373	29356	29356	Jensen	73	“ I think you slept with her sister in LA that one summer . ”
29374	29384	29265	29265	he	73	“ I did ? That summer is a blur . ”
29482	29502	29477	29477	I	0	“ Anyway , Elizabeth seems to be the brains of their family . I would n’t count her out . ”
29510	29514	29515	29515	I	0	“ All right , ”
29518	29523	29515	29515	I	0	“ Well , great . ”

30632	30667	30629	30629	Heidi	65	“ Look relationships are n’t easy . Especially not with the Wrights . They have actual skeletons in their closets and , sometimes , psycho ex - wives and a legion of devoted fans . ”

43938	43999	43934	43934	I	0	“ And then to find out that not only was she there , naked , as if this were some stupid mistake you had gone through , but she was also your fuck buddy ! You had been together for a couple of years . On and off and on again . Apparently , whenever the other one gets bored . ”
44000	44006	44007	44007	I	0	“ Jules , I know , ”
44011	44060	44007	44007	I	0	“ Yeah , well , it was wonderful to find out that the only reason you hooked up with me was because she was out of town for the holidays . You used me , Austin . You were my mistake . A Wright mistake . How ironic . ”
44221	44232	44233	44233	I	0	“ Maggie and I were n’t together two years ago , ”
44237	44254	44233	44233	I	0	“ I saw her in your bed , Austin ! The day before Valentine ’s Day ! ”
44255	44297	44298	44298	I	0	“ I know you did . I wo n’t deny that she was there , and she was there to seduce me . That we ’d been together as fuck buddies for a couple of years . And all of that . ”
44308	44331	44298	44298	I	0	“ But we did n’t hook up when you and I were together , and I was n’t with her that day . ”
44332	44341	44342	44342	Julia	86	“ Then , what was she doing there ? ”
44364	44408	44358	44358	she	86	“ Exactly what you suspect she was doing there . She showed up as a surprise for me for Valentine ’s Day . Mags does n’t really care who she hurts when she wants something . She was dating someone then , too . ”
44409	44416	44417	44417	Julia	86	“ Do n’t call her Mags , ”
44420	44457	44417	44417	Julia	86	“ I ’m not going to try to justify what happened two years ago . I was an ass . I let you believe the worst about Maggie and me even though nothing was going on . ”
44458	44465	44466	44466	She	86	“ You let me believe it . ”
44475	44491	44466	44466	She	86	“ You did n’t even tell me about Maggie . You let me find her ! ”
44492	44515	44417	44417	Julia	86	“ To be fair , I did n’t know she was going to be there when we showed up at my place . ”
44516	44544	44417	44417	Julia	86	“ That ’s not fair ! That ’s bullshit . We dated for six weeks and not one word about any ex - girlfriends . Not one ! ”
44545	44556	44557	44557	I	0	“ Did you tell me about any of your exes ? ”
44572	44605	44561	44561	I	0	“ We did n’t exactly have the who - was - the - last - person - you - fucked conversation . We were too busy enjoying our lives and moving on . ”
44629	44640	44623	44623	she	86	“ I hate this . I hate arguing with you . ”
44641	44645	44646	44646	I	0	“ You do ? ”
44650	44719	44646	44646	I	0	“ I hate it when it ’s about this shit . It was two years ago . I ’d thought I was over it . But then I saw Maggie standing there so casually while you talked to her , and I just lost it . I ’m not over Maggie . I do n’t like seeing you two together . I ’ll never be okay with that . ”
44720	44742	44743	44743	She	1000	“ I think that ’s totally understandable . I was telling her to leave . I do n’t want her there . ”
44746	44780	44743	44743	She	1000	“ But she ’s always going to be there . Lubbock is n’t small , but it ’s small enough . With my luck , we ’re going to run into her again . ”
44781	44810	44849	44849	She	86	“ I ca n’t guarantee that you ’ll never see her again . Unfortunately , Patrick is talking to Mindi again , and that ’s her new roommate . ”
44811	44816	44817	44817	Julia	86	“ Maggie and Mindi ? ”
44825	44838	44817	44817	Julia	86	“ Great . Now , I ’m going to hate M and Ms. ”
44967	45017	44950	44950	I	0	“ I do n’t care if you hate them both . I ’m telling you that , two years ago , I was so afraid of my feelings for you that I let you believe that Maggie and I had been together rather than admitting how I was feeling . ”
45018	45026	45039	45039	her	115	“ That does n’t even make sense ! ”
45027	45031	45032	45032	I	0	“ I know , ”
45064	45087	45056	45056	It	1004	“ But I told you I was n’t going to make the same mistakes . I want us to work , Jules . ”
45088	45101	45102	45102	she	115	“ And you have n’t seen Maggie since we ’ve been together ? ”
45111	45124	45106	45106	I	0	“ That was the first time I ’d seen her in weeks . ”
45125	45129	45056	45056	It	1004	“ Sounds familiar . ”
45130	45174	45175	45175	Julia	86	“ It ’s not the same . I do n’t want Maggie . I want nothing to do with her . She does n’t understand the first thing about me . She tried to offer me a beer , for fuck ’s sake . ”
45195	45200	45175	45175	Julia	86	“ She did n’t ! ”
45201	45224	45175	45175	Julia	86	“ Well , she does n’t know that I ’m not drinking like I was before . She thought I was joking . ”
45225	45230	45175	45175	Julia	86	“ That ’s shitty . ”
45231	45236	45237	45237	I	0	“ You get me . ”
45247	45284	45237	45237	I	0	“ You help me . We work together . I ’m not afraid to admit how I feel now . You have to believe that I would n’t let Maggie come between us a second time . ”
45322	45370	45316	45316	she	86	“ I do n’t know how to explain this , Austin . I feel like a crazy person for getting so worked up , but I ’m so worried about the future . I want a future with you . I want to believe that ’s possible . ”
45371	45375	45376	45376	I	0	“ It is , ”
45379	45435	45376	45376	I	0	“ And it ’s not so much that Maggie is here . It ’s a public place . She could show up anywhere , I suppose . It ’s more the trend . My fear is that the past will repeat itself . Then , I ’ll be the idiot for falling for it twice . ”
45444	45467	45438	45438	her	86	“ Seeing her brought all my old fears to the surface . I do n’t want Maggie to be a backup plan . ”
45468	45473	45474	45474	She	86	“ She ’s not . ”
45484	45494	45474	45474	She	86	“ I ’m sorry I freaked out like that . ”
45495	45517	45518	45518	She	86	“ No need to apologize . If I saw you with Trevor , I ’d probably blow a gasket , too . ”
45523	45538	45518	45518	She	86	“ You can not be jealous of Trevor . He ’s so … Trevor . ”
45539	45543	45438	45438	her	86	“ Insanely jealous . ”
45544	45548	45438	45438	her	86	“ No way . ”
45549	45569	45518	45518	She	86	“ The thought of putting my fist through his face did cross my mind every time I saw him . ”
45576	45592	45570	45570	Her	86	“ I never would have guessed . You always acted like you did n’t care . ”
45593	45615	45438	45438	her	86	“ I pushed you away . I hurt you . I figured seeing you with someone like that was my punishment . ”
45616	45627	45628	45628	I	0	“ What about the times you came on to me ? ”
45632	45645	45628	45628	I	0	“ Usually , I was drunk enough to let my feelings show . ”
45646	45659	45438	45438	her	86	“ You have a funny way of showing that you like me . ”
45660	45664	45665	45665	I	0	“ I do . ”
45709	45716	45717	45717	She	1008	“ Want to head back in ? ”
45720	45729	45717	45717	She	1008	“ Is she going to still be there ? ”
45730	45743	45665	45665	I	0	“ I can get Jensen on it . He ’s the fixer . ”
45744	45756	45717	45717	She	1008	“ I do n’t know . Maybe I should just go . ”
45757	45760	45717	45717	She	1008	“ Jules … ”
45761	45814	45815	45815	I	0	“ It was a wake - up call . I do n’t trust her . I do n’t trust her motives . I think , if she feels threatened , she ’ll do stupid shit . I ’ve known other girls like her . I do n’t want any part of it . ”
45832	45841	45815	45815	I	0	“ Then , I ’ll leave with you . ”
45842	45850	45815	45815	I	0	“ Do n’t you have family stuff ? ”
45851	45856	45815	45815	I	0	“ Screw family stuff . ”
45857	45862	45863	45863	she	1009	“ No , Austin , ”
45876	45885	45863	45863	she	1009	“ I think I want to be alone . ”
45886	45891	45815	45815	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
45892	45895	45863	45863	she	1009	“ Yeah . ”
45896	45901	45863	45863	she	1009	“ Are we okay ? ”
45902	45907	45908	45908	she	1009	“ We ’re fine , ”
46516	46521	46522	46522	I	0	“ What the hell ? ”
46610	46613	46614	46614	I	0	“ Hey , ”
46625	46631	46632	46632	Heidi	65	“ What the hell happened ? ”
46754	46791	46792	46792	Heidi	65	“ Okay . So , all this time , you thought that Austin had used you for sex until Maggie got home ? Then , he ’d cheated on you as soon as she was back ? ”
46795	46801	46792	46792	Heidi	65	“ Yep . Pretty much . ”
46802	46821	46858	46858	Emery	69	“ Why the hell did n’t you tell me this ? We could have hated on him together . ”
46822	46831	46832	46832	I	0	“ I hardly knew you at the time , ”
46850	46857	46858	46858	Emery	69	“ That ’s true , Heidi , ”
46862	46883	46858	46858	Emery	69	“ Even you said you liked to wait a year to make serious friends because so many people leave Lubbock . ”
46889	46898	46884	46884	Heidi	65	“ Okay , fine . But then later ? ”
46899	46909	46910	46910	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I was embarrassed . ”
46919	46957	46910	46910	I	0	“ Do you think he ’s telling the truth about Maggie now ? That he lied about what had happened and only let me believe that something had happened because he was basically scared of his feelings ? ”
46958	46965	46966	46966	Heidi	65	“ That actually sounds like Austin , ”
46972	46977	46969	46969	Emery	69	“ Classic Wright behavior . ”
46978	46994	46910	46910	I	0	“ Well , what do I do ? I can not deal with Maggie again . ”
46995	47021	47022	47022	Heidi	65	“ Honestly ? I know it ’s hard , considering what he put you through in the past , but maybe you should trust him , ”
47025	47095	47022	47022	Heidi	65	“ I know ; I ’m the worst to give this kind of advice . I did n’t trust anything Landon said . I did n’t ever believe he ’d divorce Miranda . Not until the evidence was directly in my face . But Austin ’s bachelor life is pretty legendary . If he ’s willing to try to be with you , I think it ’s worth it . ”
47096	47103	47104	47104	Emery	69	“ To be honest , Julia , ”
47107	47140	47104	47104	Emery	69	“ the reason we ’ve been so excited about this is because Austin has never really dated . He has flings . And he ’s not treating you like a passing dalliance . ”
47141	47151	47152	47152	I	0	“ I want to believe that . I do . ”
47167	47209	47152	47152	I	0	“ My life has n’t always been easy . Trusting people is really difficult for me . After Austin hurt me , it confirmed everything that I ’d thought I knew about him . Giving him a second chance was unfathomable . ”
47210	47219	47220	47220	Heidi	65	“ Then , why did you do it ? ”
47282	47297	47274	47274	Austin	72	“ When we ’re not at each other ’s throats , we ’re perfect . ”
47298	47304	47305	47305	Emery	69	“ Maybe that ’s enough ? ”
47308	47313	47305	47305	Emery	69	“ Maybe it is . ”
47925	47930	47931	47934	an African American woman	1055	“ Let me guess , ”
47961	47964	47940	47940	She	1055	“ Julia ? ”
47965	47970	47940	47940	She	1055	“ That ’s me . ”
47971	48002	47940	47940	She	1055	“ Wonderful . I ’m Nina . I ’ll be teaching this session . Grab a canvas , a palette , and some paints . We ’ll get started soon . ”
48003	48007	48008	48008	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
48066	48072	48073	48075	a Hispanic girl	1057	“ Is this seat taken ? ”
48089	48096	48078	48078	She	1057	“ Uh … yeah . Sorry . ”
48097	48101	48104	48105	the girl	264	“ No problem ! ”
48271	48274	48275	48276	the girl	264	“ Hey , ”
48286	48305	48275	48276	the girl	264	“ It looks like this is the only seat left . Is it cool if I sit here ? ”
48306	48309	48310	48310	I	0	“ Sure , ”
48344	48347	48348	48348	Nina	131	“ Okay , ”
48359	48416	48348	48348	Nina	131	“ Thank you all so much for coming out today . It ’s the start of a brand - new session , and I have a special treat for you today . Last session , we worked on portraits . We ’re going more advanced this session with life drawing , also known as figure drawing . ”
48433	48466	48467	48467	My	0	“ We ’re lucky to have a volunteer to sit in for this session . Please remember to give him our full respect . His job is n’t any easier than yours . ”
48536	48541	48542	48542	I	0	“ Oh my God ! ”
48556	48564	48545	48549	The girl next to me	1068	“ He ’s pretty cute , right ? ”
48649	48657	48658	48658	she	1070	“ You ’re bright red , honey , ”
48665	48681	48658	48658	she	1070	“ It ’s okay . Is this your first time having someone sit for you ? ”
48692	48695	48696	48696	I	0	“ No , ”
49064	49071	49072	49076	the girl next to me	1068	“ You should probably get started , ”
49087	49094	49072	49076	the girl next to me	1068	“ We only have an hour . ”
49095	49098	49099	49099	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
49200	49203	49204	49208	the girl next to me	1068	“ Hey , ”
49211	49222	49204	49208	the girl next to me	1068	“ You should totally stay after and talk to him . ”
49223	49226	49227	49227	I	0	“ What ? ”
49232	49255	49227	49227	I	0	“ He was staring at you the entire class . I ’d be shocked if he did n’t ask for your number . ”
49256	49261	49268	49268	she	1068	“ You think so ? ”
49262	49265	49268	49268	she	1068	“ Totally . ”
49347	49351	49352	49352	I	0	“ Austin Wright , ”
49359	49363	49364	49364	he	68	“ Julia Banner , ”
49371	49381	49364	49364	he	68	“ I can not believe you just did that . ”
49389	49399	49382	49382	He	68	“ Why ? I ’m not self - conscious . ”
49400	49406	49430	49430	his	68	“ That is blatantly obvious . ”
49407	49425	49426	49426	he	68	“ Actually , it was kind of the bargain I made to get you in the class , ”
49441	49451	49430	49430	his	68	“ You had to bargain to get me in ? ”
49452	49500	49501	49501	I	0	“ Well , the class was full . I had a friend who works the Art Trail and suggested that he could get you in , but they needed a model . So , I sort of volunteered to do it if it would get you in . ”
49510	49524	49501	49501	I	0	“ That’s … I mean , why ? Why did you do that ? ”
49529	49542	49543	49543	he	68	“ You know why . For you , of course . Look , ”
49554	49567	49543	49543	he	68	“ I know that things have been weird between us since Maggie . ”
49574	49577	49568	49568	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
49578	49621	49633	49633	He	68	“ I get why you ’re hesitant to jump into this feetfirst . I hurt you . And seeing her brought that all back to the surface . But I ’m not dipping my toe in the pool with you , Jules . ”
49622	49629	49630	49630	I	0	“ I know , I know , ”
49673	49695	49665	49665	he	68	“ This is n’t some stunt . Watching you paint was addictive . The way you looked at me , babe . ”
49699	49719	49720	49720	He	68	“ It was a work of restraint not to get turned on while watching you do what you love . ”
49733	49744	49745	49745	He	68	“ Was it that much of a turn - on ? ”
49760	49766	49745	49745	He	68	“ What do you think ? ”
49781	49789	49767	49767	I	0	“ Looks like you were into it . ”
49790	49822	49845	49845	he	68	“ I was half - tempted to make you be the model with me . I would n’t have minded one bit if you were naked underneath me on that platform . ”
49823	49826	49827	49827	I	0	“ Filthy , ”
49830	49844	49845	49845	he	68	“ I do n’t think I was the only one thinking dirty thoughts , ”
49857	49883	49845	49845	he	68	“ I ca n’t believe you sat naked for me . For an entire class of people so that I could get into a studio . ”
49934	49943	49930	49930	he	68	“ I can sit naked for you anytime . ”
49977	49989	49990	49990	He	68	“ Watching you naked for an hour like this was torture . ”
50164	50169	50170	50170	he	68	“ Shh , baby , ”
50198	50201	50202	50202	I	0	“ Please , ”
50460	50464	50465	50465	I	0	“ Oh God , ”
50477	50484	50465	50465	I	0	“ Come for me , Jules . ”
50485	50488	50489	50489	I	0	“ Yes , ”
50492	50499	50489	50489	I	0	“ Yes . God , yes . ”
50598	50604	50591	50591	Nina	131	“ Everything okay back there ? ”
50663	50687	50688	50688	Nina	131	“ It ’s my pleasure . Thank you for volunteering to sit for us . I ’ve been looking for someone for weeks , ”
50691	50702	50703	50703	Austin	68	“ It was n’t as bad as I ’d thought , ”
50706	50719	50703	50703	Austin	68	“ Well , good . I ’ll see you both next week . ”
50720	50723	50724	50724	I	0	“ Bye , ”
50806	50812	50813	50813	Austin	68	“ Where ’s your car ? ”
50848	50858	50838	50838	I	0	“ Wait … where the fuck is the Tahoe ? ”

50922	50925	50919	50919	Austin	68	“ Fuck ! ”
50926	50950	50919	50919	Austin	68	“ It ’s fine . Call the company on the sign and see if it ’s there . I can drive you over . ”
50951	50958	50959	50959	I	0	“ I fucking hate tow companies , ”
51000	51003	51004	51004	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
51014	51019	51004	51004	I	0	“ Just my luck . ”
51027	51049	51020	51020	Austin	68	“ Do n’t let this ruin our date . It happens to everyone at some point . It ’ll be fine . ”
51050	51061	51062	51062	We	1114	“ You ’re right . I know . But ugh ! ”
51126	51134	51102	51102	I	0	“ I ’m here for the Tahoe . ”
51135	51139	51140	51140	he	68	“ Sure thing , ”
51156	51176	51177	51177	He	68	“ I ca n’t believe you guys even towed that parking lot . People park there all the time . ”
51180	51193	51177	51177	He	68	“ The company that owns it called it in . Bad luck . ”
51230	51238	51239	51240	the guy	870	“ You ’re all good to go , ”
51258	51261	51239	51240	the guy	870	“ Thanks . ”
51275	51293	51262	51262	I	0	“ All good to go . The company called in the cars there for the art studio . ”
51294	51297	51320	51320	his	870	“ Assholes . ”
51298	51301	51320	51320	his	870	“ Right ? ”
51302	51311	51262	51262	I	0	“ At least we got it all settled . ”
51312	51315	51316	51316	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
51326	51330	51316	51316	I	0	“ Come over ? ”
51331	51334	51262	51262	I	0	“ Absolutely . ”
51335	51340	51341	51341	He	870	“ See you there . ”
51395	51405	51406	51406	I	0	“ Why the hell am I awake this early ? ”
51465	51472	51473	51473	Sutton	88	“ Maverick is in the marathon , ”
51502	51533	51496	51496	I	0	“ I had to be here before seven . Be glad you got to miss the opening and all that . I barely got a kiss before he took off . ”
51534	51548	51549	51549	Sutton	88	“ Why would anyone want to run a marathon in this Texas heat ? ”
51552	51591	51549	51549	Sutton	88	“ He ’s obsessed . This is his third this year . He ’s constantly training . He runs , like , a hundred miles a week . Ten to fifteen every morning before he goes to work . ”
51600	51607	51549	51549	Sutton	88	“ Um … that sounds horrible . ”
51608	51613	51614	51614	she	88	“ Does n’t it ? ”
51620	51642	51643	51643	I	0	“ But I like him sexy and sweaty . Jason usually naps when Mav gets back before work . Very convenient . ”
51646	51652	51643	51643	I	0	“ Oh , I bet . ”
51653	51665	51666	51666	Sutton	88	“ How long does it take for Heidi to get waters ? ”
51669	51678	51666	51666	Sutton	88	“ It ’s so effing hot out here . ”
51700	51707	51691	51691	her	88	“ At least he ’s happy . ”
51708	51715	51716	51716	I	0	“ Where ’s everyone else anyway ? ”
51719	51740	51716	51716	I	0	“ I did n’t think that I would be the first one here or else I would have slept in . ”
51741	51752	51691	51691	her	88	“ As if Heidi would have let you sleep in . ”
51753	51756	51691	51691	her	88	“ Truth . ”
51757	51771	51716	51716	I	0	“ All the guys and Mor are bringing in the first interview candidate . ”
51772	51778	51691	51691	her	88	“ For the CFO position ? ”
51782	51788	51779	51779	Sutton	88	“ Some guy from California . ”
51789	51803	51716	51716	I	0	“ Why the hell would he come here for the Fourth of July ? ”
51804	51824	51825	51825	She	88	“ No idea . I ’m only half in the know since I ’m not working for the company . ”
51845	51856	51825	51825	She	88	“ Not that I want to work for the company . ”
51857	51864	51716	51716	I	0	“ Well , you have Jason . ”
51865	51872	51873	51873	she	88	“ Even if I did n’t , ”
51877	51889	51890	51890	I	0	“ I did n’t want to work with my family either , ”
51907	51920	51921	51921	Sutton	88	“ It ’s just … they all expect it , you know ? ”
51927	51963	51921	51921	Sutton	88	“ It ’s not enough that Mav works there . Mor looks down on me because I want to stay home . There ’s nothing wrong with loving babies and wanting to raise a family ! ”
51964	51980	51981	51981	Sutton	88	“ I think you should do whatever makes you happy . It ’s your life . ”
51985	51991	51981	51981	Sutton	88	“ Oh , I do . ”
51992	51999	52000	52000	Heidi	65	“ Here you go , bitches , ”
52022	52025	52011	52011	I	0	“ Language ? ”
52026	52036	52037	52037	She	88	“ Eh , they ’ll hear it one day . ”
52040	52072	52037	52037	She	88	“ So , I heard from Landon , and he should be here soon . They just found a parking spot . And Emery is coming with her sister ’s family . ”
52073	52088	52089	52089	Sutton	88	“ Oh , Jason will be so happy that Lilyanne and Bethany are here ! ”
52401	52406	52407	52407	Jensen	73	“ Hey , everyone , ”
52427	52480	52407	52407	Jensen	73	“ I ’d like to introduce David Calloway . He ’s here all weekend , interviewing with the company . You ’ve already met Emery , but this is her family . This is my little sister , Sutton , with her son , Jason , and Austin ’s girlfriend , Julia . ”
52491	52508	52483	52483	his	118	“ Pleasure to meet you all . Thank you for letting me crash your family holiday . ”
52509	52515	52516	52516	Sutton	88	“ That ’s all right , ”
52519	52526	52516	52516	Sutton	88	“ The more , the merrier . ”
52561	52568	52569	52569	he	72	“ Fuck , I missed you , ”
52575	52591	52569	52569	he	72	“ I missed you , too . How are you doing with all of this ? ”
52607	52612	52592	52592	He	72	“ It ’s fine . ”
52613	52625	52569	52569	he	72	“ You say that , and I do n’t believe you . ”
52626	52732	52592	52592	He	72	“ Okay . It fucking sucks . The entire thing feels utterly ridiculous . This guy is some big shot from Silicon Valley . What the fuck does he want to do with Wright Construction ? For that matter , what the fuck does he even know about the business ? He ’s never been in construction before . I know he ’s qualified , but we ’d have to train him from the start . I already know the job . I ’ve always known the job . The whole thing could be avoided so easily if they just went back to the board . ”
52802	52813	52794	52794	he	72	“ You really appreciate this company , do n’t you ? ”
52814	52817	52818	52818	he	72	“ Yes , ”
52847	52858	52822	52822	He	72	“ I feel like this was an eye - opener . ”
52859	52863	52822	52822	He	72	“ How so ? ”
52864	52902	52907	52907	he	72	“ Like I ’ve just been getting by . I did n’t really care what happened as long as I could continue my life the way it was . Now … that does n’t feel like enough . ”
52963	52973	52974	52974	I	0	“ What are you going to do about it ? ”
52980	52986	52977	52977	He	72	“ What can I do ? ”
52987	52995	53016	53016	his	72	“ Anything you set your mind to . ”
52996	53005	52977	52977	He	72	“ I ca n’t get the CFO position . ”
53006	53013	53014	53014	He	72	“ Do you really want it ? ”
53023	53033	53014	53014	He	72	“ No one ’s ever really asked me that . ”
53034	53037	52977	52977	He	72	“ Well ? ”
53038	53083	52977	52977	He	72	“ I do want it . But I do n’t know if I want it because it was always the position I thought I would get or if it ’s because that ’s what I want to do with the rest of my life . ”
53084	53107	53108	53108	He	72	“ Then , maybe figure out what you do want to do with the rest of your life and go from there . ”
53116	53124	53108	53108	He	72	“ What would I do without you ? ”
53125	53131	53132	53132	I	0	“ You ’d be lost , ”
53136	53140	53132	53132	I	0	“ Probably true . ”
53141	53166	53108	53108	He	72	“ So , what do you think of this David guy besides the fact that you do n’t think he should get the position ? ”
53167	53184	53185	53185	Austin	72	“ I did n’t say that . I said that we ’d have to train him . ”
53193	53201	53189	53189	his	72	“ I kind of like the guy . ”
53202	53206	53108	53108	He	72	“ So begrudging . ”
53207	53215	53108	53108	He	72	“ I really want to hate him . ”
53216	53222	53108	53108	He	72	“ But you do n’t ? ”
53223	53248	53108	53108	He	72	“ Nah . He seems like a good guy , smart as a whip , and charming . It ’s kind of not fair . ”
53249	53262	53108	53108	He	72	“ As if any of you Wrights know about what ’s fair . ”
53263	53269	53270	53270	he	72	“ Watch it , babe , ”
53537	53549	53550	53550	Sutton	88	“ It ’ll probably be another hour before Mav comes through , ”
53559	53568	53550	53550	Sutton	88	“ These people are insane with their times . ”
53569	53595	53596	53596	Morgan	78	“ Watch out , Sutton . You might need a twenty - six - point - two sticker for the back of your car soon , ”
53599	53605	53606	53606	she	78	“ Mav already has one , ”
53614	53623	53606	53606	she	78	“ I know how much you love running . ”
53624	53633	53634	53634	Sutton	88	“ Adore it . My favorite thing ever . ”
53637	53648	53634	53634	Sutton	88	“ I like it as much as you like babies . ”
53653	53658	53649	53649	Morgan	78	“ I like Jason . ”
53659	53671	53606	53606	she	78	“ He does n’t count . You have to love him . ”
53672	53675	53606	53606	she	78	“ Fair . ”
53676	53682	53683	53683	I	0	“ You both are ridiculous , ”
53689	53692	53693	53693	Morgan	78	“ Truth , ”
53696	53711	53693	53693	Morgan	78	“ I do n’t like babies . Sutton hates running . What about you ? ”
53712	53730	53731	53731	I	0	“ Heights . I ’ve never liked them , but a couple of years ago , I … ”
53753	53765	53745	53745	I	0	“ I do n’t know . They just freak me out . ”
53766	53769	53770	53770	Sutton	88	“ Understandable , ”
53773	53789	53790	53790	Morgan	78	“ I do n’t mind heights . It ’s the falling that would bother me , ”
53799	53806	53793	53793	Sutton	88	“ They go hand in hand ! ”
53807	53813	53814	53814	I	0	“ Yeah , they do , ”
53920	53930	53931	53931	he	118	“ And you work for the company , too ? ”
53937	53947	53934	53934	I	0	“ I do . I ’m head of HR . ”
53948	53962	53908	53908	David	118	“ Wonderful to meet you . Did you grow up here as well ? ”
53963	53978	53908	53908	David	118	“ No , I ’m the only transplant . I moved here from Ohio . ”
53979	53988	53934	53934	I	0	“ That must have been a big change . ”
53989	53993	53994	53994	I	0	“ It was , ”
53997	54009	53994	53994	I	0	“ I would assume as big as coming from northern California . ”
54014	54022	54010	54010	He	118	“ Yes . Though you have snow . ”
54023	54034	54035	54035	Morgan	78	“ True . It does n’t snow that much here . ”
54040	54047	54035	54035	Morgan	78	“ It snows enough for me . ”
54048	54063	54010	54010	He	118	“ I ’m glad I never have to shovel another driveway in my life . ”
54064	54070	54071	54071	David	118	“ I could see that , ”
54074	54095	54071	54071	David	118	“ Things seem … slower here . California is always go , go , go . Do you love it ? ”
54096	54112	54113	54113	I	0	“ Well , I would say that Wright is still go , go , go , ”
54117	54139	54113	54113	I	0	“ But Lubbock is definitely a slower pace . It has that nice small - town vibe in a bigger city . ”
54140	54157	54158	54158	His	118	“ I ’ve noticed that . I like it so far . Different than I expected . ”
54164	54176	54162	54162	Sutton	88	“ And you do n’t work for the company , right ? ”
54177	54184	54185	54185	she	88	“ I ’m the only one , ”
54203	54211	54212	54212	She	88	“ He ’s adorable . Yours right ? ”
54215	54246	54247	54247	David	118	“ He looks just like his dad though . I had to carry him for nine months , and he came out looking like someone else . Not exactly fair . ”
54380	54383	54384	54384	Sutton	88	“ Annie , ”
54387	54395	54384	54384	Sutton	88	“ what ’s going on with you ? ”
54396	54399	54400	54400	Annie	131	“ Mav , ”
54404	54412	54400	54400	Annie	131	“ Mav … Mav , he collapsed . ”
54413	54416	54417	54417	she	131	“ What ? ”
54438	54447	54428	54428	she	131	“ Is he okay ? Where is he ? ”
54448	54533	54539	54539	her	131	“ About a mile back . They were going to send an EMT , but I just took off to come get you . They ’re taking him to the hospital . I do n’t know what ’s wrong . We had almost made it all the way . One minute , we were joking about hugging you with how sweaty we were . The next , he was on the ground . You … you need to get to the hospital right away . ”
54572	54580	54581	54581	Kimber	70	“ We ’ll take care of Jason , ”
54593	54597	54598	54598	Sutton	88	“ Thank you , ”
54638	54647	54648	54648	Jensen	73	“ You can come with us , Annie , ”
54651	54655	54656	54656	she	131	“ Thank you , ”
54670	54687	54688	54688	Jensen	73	“ We should all probably go to the hospital to find out what ’s going on , ”
54709	54717	54718	54718	I	0	“ Do you think he ’s okay ? ”
54730	54736	54727	54727	her	131	“ I do n’t know . ”
55223	55227	55210	55210	She	86	“ Hey babe . ”
55260	55265	55266	55266	Julia	86	“ How ’s Sutton ? ”
55272	55287	55266	55266	Julia	86	“ God , what a stupid question . I ’m sure she ’s horrible . ”
55288	55296	55297	55297	Julia	86	“ Yeah . She ’s not good . ”
55306	55318	55297	55297	Julia	86	“ I ca n’t imagine . I just … can’t imagine . ”
55319	55357	55266	55266	Julia	86	“ No , I do n’t think any of us can . It made me want to come see you immediately . Touch you , feel you , make sure you were still here , still real . ”
55375	55380	55366	55366	I	0	“ That ’s sweet . ”
55381	55423	55266	55266	Julia	86	“ It ’s the truth . The thought that you could be gone sent me into a panic . I ca n’t explain it . I could n’t breathe . I could n’t think . I just needed to see you . ”
55424	55444	55445	55445	Julia	86	“ Sutton will feel that every day , and when she looks for Mav , he ’ll be gone , ”
55448	55456	55445	55445	Julia	86	“ Maybe we should get you home . ”
55501	55505	55506	55506	she	86	“ All right , ”
55509	55519	55506	55506	she	86	“ Should we say good - bye to anyone ? ”
55520	55527	55528	55528	She	86	“ I ’ll just text Jensen . ”
55624	55634	55635	55635	I	0	“ Maybe we should get you in a shower , ”
55649	55661	55638	55638	She	86	“ How is she going to be able to go on ? ”
55662	55678	55588	55588	me	0	“ I do n’t know , Jules . It ’s not going to be easy . ”
55679	55738	55635	55635	I	0	“ It ’s going to be impossible . I was there with her all day . I saw her love for that man . She was sad because she ’d barely gotten a kiss before he left for the marathon . She ’s going to regret every single thing that happened this morning . It ’s just wrong . ”
55739	55789	55790	55790	She	1218	“ I know . There ’s nothing any of us can do for Sutton , except be there for her . And , right now … we ca n’t do anything . So , let me take care of you . It ’s the only thing I can do . ”
55800	55807	55790	55790	She	1218	“ I really want a drink . ”
55808	55811	55812	55812	I	0	“ Okay , ”
55816	55822	55812	55812	I	0	“ I can do that . ”
55823	55836	55790	55790	She	1218	“ Fuck , Austin . No . No , no , no . ”
55846	55863	55839	55839	her	1218	“ I should n’t have a drink . Definitely not around you . That ’s horrible . ”
55874	55890	55864	55864	I	0	“ You ’re hurting . It ’s perfectly normal to want to numb the pain . ”
55891	55895	55923	55923	her	1218	“ Do n’t . ”
55896	55904	55864	55864	I	0	“ I wo n’t drink with you . ”
55905	55910	55864	55864	I	0	“ It ’s mean . ”
55911	55918	55919	55919	I	0	“ It ’s okay , Jules , ”
55930	55942	55919	55919	I	0	“ It ’s not okay . None of this is okay . ”
55943	55946	55947	55947	She	1218	“ Julia . ”
55960	56025	55954	55954	I	0	“ None of this is going to get better today . Not for Sutton . Not for you . Not for anyone . Beating yourself up for how you ’re feeling is n’t going to help anything . If you want a drink , I ’ll pour you one . I ’ll take care of you . Just let me take care of you . ”
56026	56031	56032	56032	she	1218	“ Oh , Austin , ”
56237	56241	56242	56242	she	1218	“ Thank you , ”
56245	56249	56242	56242	she	1218	“ Of course . ”
56709	56732	56700	56700	Reality	142	“ You know , Jules , with everything that happened today , I do n’t want any more regrets in my life . ”
56733	56736	56804	56804	she	86	“ Mmhmm ? ”
56737	56798	56804	56804	she	86	“ I know we might have started out in a fucked up way . That we ’ve had our ups and downs . But all I could think when I found out about Mav was that … they did n’t get enough time . Not by a long shot . They were only married for a year and a half . ”
56799	56803	56804	56804	she	86	“ I know , ”
56810	56825	56804	56804	she	86	“ Life is so uncertain . I do n’t want us wasting our moment . ”
56826	56836	56837	56837	I	0	“ We ’re not wasting our moment , Austin . ”
57154	57158	57146	57146	Austin	89	“ You okay ? ”
57164	57171	57146	57146	Austin	89	“ How could anyone be okay ? ”
57172	57176	57177	57177	He	89	“ I know . ”
57404	57412	57413	57413	Morgan	78	“ Sut , I ’ll take him , ”
57523	57526	57518	57518	Jensen	73	“ Sut . ”
57527	57531	57532	57532	she	88	“ Just go , ”
57536	57548	57532	57532	she	88	“ Sutton , come on . I ’ll drive you home . ”
57549	57555	57556	57556	Jensen	73	“ I said , go . ”
57647	57653	57640	57640	Austin	89	“ Come on , Jules . ”
57786	57795	57796	57796	Austin	89	“ I was n’t looking forward to that , ”
57799	57805	57796	57796	Austin	89	“ I ’d imagine not . ”
57806	57819	57820	57820	He	89	“ The world sure is n’t fair to the Wrights , huh ? ”
57843	57889	57835	57835	he	89	“ Sutton lost our mom when she was only one year old , just like Jason . She grew up without a mom , and he ’s going to grow up without a dad . Then , our dad died when she was only eleven . ”
57890	57893	57820	57820	He	89	“ Awful . ”
57894	57904	57835	57835	he	89	“ I always thought she was the lucky one . ”
57905	57908	57835	57835	he	89	“ How ? ”
57909	57940	57941	57941	He	1269	“ She does n’t really remember them . She did n’t have to have their shadows following her around . She ’s shone brighter and loved easier and felt deeper . ”
57951	57964	57941	57941	He	1269	“ And then this happens . How much can one person take ? ”
58022	58039	58040	58040	he	1269	“ I ’m really worried that she ’s going to lose all that brightness and joy , ”
58043	58094	58040	58040	he	1269	“ She does n’t know how much she ’s the glue to our family . The optimism to our pessimism . The idealism to our cynicism . I would n’t blame her if she did . She ’s lost a piece of herself . But I hate it for her . ”
58095	58103	58104	58104	I	0	“ She ’ll come back to herself , ”
58107	58131	58104	58104	I	0	“ You just have to be there for her when she needs you . And she ’ll need you . All of you . ”
58132	58136	58040	58040	he	1269	“ And you . ”
58137	58140	58040	58040	he	1269	“ Me ? ”
58141	58149	58104	58104	I	0	“ You were there when it happened . ”
58150	58156	58040	58040	he	1269	“ I suppose I was . ”
58157	58177	58178	58178	I	0	“ You ’ll always be ingrained in the memory of that day . She ’ll need you , too . ”
58448	58455	58456	58456	Austin	89	“ Let ’s get some air , ”
58496	58506	58507	58507	he	89	“ You looked like you were about to hyperventilate , ”
58510	58531	58507	58507	he	89	“ Yeah . It was hard to breathe in there . I do n’t know how Sutton ’s doing it . ”
58532	58543	58483	58483	Austin	89	“ Jules , I ’ve been thinking a lot lately . ”
58544	58548	58507	58507	he	89	“ About what ? ”
58549	58552	58553	58553	he	89	“ Us , ”
58560	58596	58553	58553	he	89	“ I wasted two years without you all because of some idiotic reason . I should n’t have feared my feelings for you . This is what I want . You are what I want . ”
58608	58629	58597	58597	I	0	“ You are what I want , too . I appreciate you taking care of me during the last week . ”
58630	58643	58644	58644	My	0	“ I plan to do it for the rest of my life . ”
58649	58656	58644	58644	My	0	“ That ’s a bold statement . ”
58664	58672	58660	58660	himself	89	“ It is . It really is . ”
58673	58687	58597	58597	I	0	“ You want to be with me for the rest of your life ? ”
58688	58717	58718	58718	he	89	“ Yes . One day , I ’m going to be the man you deserve . Then , I ’m going to put a ring on your finger , ”
58733	58746	58718	58718	he	89	“ Going to give you my name and make you mine forever . ”
58819	58828	58829	58829	He	89	“ You ’re already the man I deserve . ”
58832	58849	58829	58829	He	89	“ I assure you , I ’m not . But I ’m going to get there . ”
58923	58928	58929	58929	Austin	89	“ What is it ? ”
58948	58951	58936	58936	he	89	“ Nothing , ”
58964	58968	58936	58936	he	89	“ You sure ? ”
58971	58975	58976	58976	I	0	“ Just overwhelmed . ”
59062	59065	59066	59066	she	88	“ Hey , ”
59069	59074	59075	59075	Austin	89	“ Sorry about that . ”
59085	59095	59075	59075	Austin	89	“ You do n’t have to apologize to anyone . ”
59102	59187	59096	59096	Sutton	88	“ I know . I just … hate all of this . I hate every last thing about it . I should feel thankful that all these people want to help me , but I do n’t . I feel nothing . I look around for Mav to make fun of the big event , and then I remember … he ’s not here . He ’s never going to be here again . And I do n’t know how to live that life . ”
59188	59197	59198	59198	I	0	“ You do n’t have to entertain anyone , ”
59202	59220	59198	59198	I	0	“ If you do n’t like any of this , then I ’ll tell everyone to leave . ”
59221	59227	59096	59096	Sutton	88	“ It ’d be rude . ”
59228	59231	59232	59232	I	0	“ So ? ”
59238	59274	59232	59232	I	0	“ I do n’t mind being the bad guy . You do not have to be available right now . You have to do what ’s best for you and Jason . That ’s it . ”
59275	59283	59096	59096	Sutton	88	“ You ’d do that for me ? ”
59284	59290	59291	59291	Austin	89	“ Of course we would , ”
59298	59307	59291	59291	Austin	89	“ Would you do something else for me ? ”
59308	59313	59314	59314	I	0	“ What ’s that ? ”
59339	59347	59330	59330	I	0	“ Take me to get a tattoo ? ”
59352	59359	59360	59360	I	0	“ You ’re sure about this ? ”
59380	59385	59360	59360	I	0	“ More than sure . ”
59456	59462	59463	59463	Julia	86	“ She ’ll do great , ”
59466	59474	59463	59463	Julia	86	“ The first one is the hardest . ”
59482	59485	59475	59475	I	0	“ What ? ”
59486	59495	59496	59496	Sutton	88	“ I was just thinking the same thing . ”
59514	59517	59507	59507	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
59518	59522	59523	59523	Sutton	88	“ Do n’t , ”
59559	59566	59567	59567	Sutton	88	“ Let ’s just do this , ”
59611	59614	59615	59615	Nick	146	“ Austin , ”
59623	59640	59615	59615	Nick	146	“ I was happy when you called , man . What are we doing for you ? ”
59641	59646	59647	59647	I	0	“ Not for me , ”
59650	59657	59647	59647	I	0	“ This is my sister Sutton . ”
59658	59662	59663	59663	he	146	“ Virgin skin ? ”
59666	59674	59675	59675	Sutton	88	“ Yeah , this is my first , ”
59685	59694	59675	59675	Sutton	88	“ Great . You know what you want ? ”
59698	59701	59695	59695	She	88	“ Yeah . ”
59702	59706	59707	59707	Nick	146	“ And you ? ”
59716	59720	59710	59710	He	146	“ May I ? ”
59745	59758	59742	59742	Nick	146	“ Please tell me , I get to add to this masterpiece . ”
59759	59773	59774	59774	she	86	“ I have n’t quite figured out what my next tattoo will be , ”
59778	59802	59776	59776	him	146	“ Whoever did the rest of your work really knew what they were doing . I ’d love to play on your skin . ”
59817	59822	59803	59803	Michael	147	“ Language , love . ”
59823	59838	59776	59776	him	146	“ Michael , appreciate her beautiful work , and then get back to me . ”
59839	59846	59847	59847	Michael	147	“ She ’s not my type , ”
59858	59867	59851	59851	Nick	146	“ You ’re not mine either , honey . ”
59888	59901	59881	59881	Julia	86	“ That ’s probably for the best since I ’m with Austin . ”
59902	59912	59913	59913	Michael	147	“ Oh , new honey . I love it . ”
59919	59922	59923	59923	Austin	89	“ Girlfriend , ”

59955	59961	59962	59962	Sutton	88	“ They filled me in , ”
59975	59981	59967	59967	she	88	“ A couple of times . ”
59989	60024	60025	60025	Julia	86	“ I bet they did . They ca n’t help it . Now , let ’s head back and get you prepped . Tell me everything about you . What are we doing today ? ”
60045	60048	60049	60049	Julia	86	“ Nervous ? ”
60052	60062	60049	60049	Julia	86	“ Yeah , but I can handle anything now . ”
60063	60071	60072	60072	Sutton	88	“ What are you going to get ? ”
60079	60160	60072	60072	Sutton	88	“ A dandelion . It ’s how Mav and I started . We ’d known each other for a year before he worked up the nerve to ask me out . Said I was out of his league . Then , we were at a party . We were both a little tipsy . It was silly at the time , but he plucked a dandelion and wished on it for us . It ’s been our thing since then . ”
60161	60166	60167	60167	Julia	86	“ It ’s perfect , ”
60183	60186	60187	60187	Sutton	88	“ Yeah , ”

60242	60281	60190	60190	She	88	“ I know that I ’d never be able to do this with anyone else . Thank God Jensen is n’t prejudice and does n’t care what someone looks like as long as they can do the work . ”
60282	60293	60294	60294	I	0	“ I would have been fired a long time ago , ”
60302	60355	60297	60297	Sutton	88	“ Yeah , right . For one , you can cover your tattoos with a button - up , but Julia has hers on display . She dyes her hair . She has a nose ring . Her skin is a palette of colors . She does n’t hide who she is . ”
60497	60504	60505	60505	she	86	“ It was n’t so bad , ”
60518	60527	60528	60528	Julia	86	“ We ’re going to get you addicted , ”
60535	60543	60531	60531	Sutton	88	“ I feel like I already am . ”

61203	61206	61126	61126	Patrick	72	“ Maybe . ”
61207	61238	61239	61239	Patrick	72	“ Look , I ’m like your brother . I ’ve been there from the start . I know that Maverick ’s death ca n’t be easy with your past , ”
61242	61252	61239	61239	Patrick	72	“ But is having a drink really the answer ? ”
61253	61261	61262	61262	I	0	“ Do you have one or not ? ”

61332	61342	61291	61291	Patrick	72	“ Then , you do n’t need that drink . ”

61360	61380	61348	61348	I	0	“ I know I do n’t . But … what the fuck am I going to do , Patrick ? ”
61381	61402	61403	61403	I	0	“ You ’re going to sit your ass back down and deal with it , like how everyone else does . ”
61406	61413	61403	61403	I	0	“ How does everyone else deal ? ”
61414	61418	61419	61419	he	72	“ With time , ”

63231	63244	63228	63228	I	0	“ Then , you let me take that sweet ass of yours . ”
63245	63251	63252	63252	His	72	“ That what you want ? ”
63316	63330	63331	63331	he	72	“ Fuck , Jules ! Jesus Christ ! Fuck , fuck , fuck , ”
63345	63356	63357	63357	I	0	“ You ’re going to be saying that a lot , ”
63381	63389	63375	63375	Austin	72	“ Do n’t fucking take those off . ”
63390	63393	63406	63406	His	72	“ Oh ? ”
63394	63405	63406	63406	His	72	“ I ’m fucking you in that . Only that . ”
63414	63439	63406	63406	His	72	“ I ’m never going to be able to look at those heels again without thinking about you showing up and getting me off . ”
63469	63476	63477	63477	he	72	“ I want to try this , ”
63480	63484	63477	63477	he	72	“ Try what ? ”
63566	63571	63572	63572	he	72	“ God , Jules , ”
63654	63661	63662	63662	he	72	“ Perfect . You ’re perfect , ”
63706	63710	63711	63711	he	72	“ Not yet , ”
63714	63717	63718	63718	I	0	“ Please , ”
63758	63766	63767	63767	I	0	“ You ready to come for me ? ”
63966	63972	63973	63973	I	0	“ That was … wow , ”
63979	63986	63987	63987	he	72	“ Yeah . It really was , ”
64068	64082	64059	64059	I	0	“ You took everything out of me . I could go to sleep . ”
64091	64108	64089	64089	himself	72	“ I ’d just have to wake you up for another round when I got back . ”
64109	64125	64126	64126	He	72	“ You ’d have to convince me . This one was a thank - you . ”
64133	64139	64126	64126	He	72	“ A thank - you ? ”
64140	64147	64148	64148	His	72	“ Yeah . For the flowers . ”
64154	64158	64148	64148	His	72	“ What flowers ? ”
64175	64182	64159	64159	I	0	“ The lilies you sent me . ”
64183	64193	64126	64126	He	72	“ Uh , I did n’t send you lilies . ”
64194	64199	64159	64159	I	0	“ Wh - what ? ”
64200	64209	64210	64210	he	72	“ Who ’s sending you flowers , Jules ? ”
64216	64225	64210	64210	he	72	“ Who do I need to beat up ? ”
64226	64229	64230	64230	I	0	“ I … ”
64233	64237	64230	64230	I	0	“ Oh no . ”
64303	64308	64309	64309	I	0	“ Oh , fuck , ”
64312	64315	64309	64309	I	0	“ Jules ? ”
64316	64327	64328	64328	I	0	“ No , no , no , no , no , ”
64335	64360	64328	64328	I	0	“ You ’re white as a ghost . What is going on ? Does this have to do with who sent you the flowers ? ”
64377	64387	64361	64361	I	0	“ Oh my God , I ’m so stupid . ”
64388	64394	64328	64328	I	0	“ What is going on ? ”
64395	64402	64403	64403	I	0	“ I thought I got away , ”
64406	64413	64403	64403	I	0	“ I thought I was safe . ”
64414	64423	64424	64424	I	0	“ Babe , you ’re safe with me . ”
64435	64442	64424	64424	I	0	“ I ’m not safe anywhere . ”
64443	64454	64403	64403	I	0	“ You ’re scaring me . What is going on ? ”
64455	64463	64464	64464	I	0	“ My name is n’t Julia Banner , ”
64480	64488	64474	64474	His	1352	“ Okay . What is your name ? ”
64489	64493	64403	64403	I	0	“ Juliana Peterson . ”
64494	64507	64403	64403	I	0	“ I do n’t understand . Why did you change your name ? ”
64508	64513	64474	64474	His	1352	“ Because of Dillon . ”
64514	64527	64528	64528	I	0	“ And who is Dillon ? This guy send you the flowers ? ”
64531	64536	64528	64528	I	0	“ I think so . ”
64541	64549	64528	64528	I	0	“ He ’s my ex - boyfriend . ”
64550	64559	64474	64474	His	1352	“ A serious one , I ’m guessing . ”
64560	64575	64474	64474	His	1352	“ Yeah . The reason I did n’t want to have the exes talk . ”
64576	64592	64593	64593	I	0	“ So , why is he sending you flowers ? Are you still seeing him ? ”
64604	64666	64474	64474	His	1352	“ No , Dillon destroyed my life . There ’s so much you do n’t know , Austin . Fuck . I wanted to tell you everything . I wanted to tell you who I really was . Ever since Mav died , I wanted to spill it all , but I just … I was worried you ’d hate me . ”
64667	64676	64474	64474	His	1352	“ Jules , how could I hate you ? ”
64677	64687	64688	64688	He	1353	“ Because you do n’t know anything about me . ”
64698	64709	64688	64688	He	1353	“ I know everything I need to know about you . ”
64710	64716	64474	64474	His	1352	“ You say that now . ”
64717	64741	64742	64742	he	1353	“ Then , tell me . You have a different name . So what ? I plan to change your last name anyway , ”
64746	64752	64742	64742	he	1353	“ You can tell me . ”
64753	64778	64779	64779	I	0	“ I met Dillon the summer before college . He was … he was bad news . I liked … like guys that way , ”
64792	64883	64779	64779	I	0	“ I was enamored . Dillon only showed me the parts of him that he wanted me to see . I gave up my full ride at Northwestern to stay home and go to community college . I could n’t be away from him . He would n’t let me be away from him . I was that idiot girl . He was dealing drugs . I knew but thought it did n’t really matter . You do n’t grow up around Akron without seeing your fair share of drugs . “
64926	64932	64920	64920	I	0	” I shook my head . “
64990	64991	64985	64985	I	0	” “
65001	65002	65003	65003	I	0	” “
65059	65060	65038	65038	She	1359	” “
65068	65069	65070	65070	I	0	” “
65078	65082	65070	65070	I	0	” I admitted . “
65093	65094	65085	65085	I	0	” “
65106	65107	65099	65099	you	0	” “
65113	65123	65124	65124	He	151	” I whispered , putting all the pieces together . “
65142	65143	65135	65135	He	151	” “
65154	65155	65156	65156	I	0	” “
65159	65163	65156	65156	I	0	” I whispered . “
65176	65177	65168	65168	he	151	” “
65191	65192	65193	65193	I	0	” “
65203	65221	65195	65195	you	0	” Austin said . He stood and started pacing the room . His hands clenched and unclenched . “
65241	65242	65243	65243	I	0	” “
65248	65249	65250	65250	Austin	72	” “
65252	65253	65250	65250	Austin	72	” “
65260	65319	65320	65320	Austin	72	” He continued pacing , absentmindedly running his hands through his hair . I could see his brain working . I did n’t know if he was trying to find a solution or if he was just pissed at me . I knew the look on his face . He wanted a drink . I was overloading him . “
65322	65323	65320	65320	Austin	72	” “
65327	65340	65320	65320	Austin	72	” he snapped . I recoiled into myself , and he sighed . “
65353	65354	65347	65347	I	0	” “
65359	65360	65347	65347	I	0	” “
65422	65423	65416	65416	you	72	” “
65431	65545	65429	65429	Austin	72	” Austin Wright might be an asshole . He might have a drinking problem . He might put himself first in most things . But no one was as bad as Dillon . If this was already too much , there was no way I could tell him the rest . If I peeled back all the layers of Juliana Peterson , no one could love her . She was a broken , used girl . And , when I thought about Dillon , I became that scared , helpless girl again . Rather than the strong woman who ’d gotten away and built her own life . And I needed Julia Banner . “
65554	65567	65568	65568	I	0	” Austin said abruptly . I nodded , knowing he was right . “
65575	65576	65568	65568	I	0	” “
65582	65583	65568	65568	I	0	” “
65593	65594	65584	65584	Austin	68	” “
65599	65600	65584	65584	Austin	68	” “
65611	65612	65613	65613	Julia	86	” “
65615	65616	65613	65613	Julia	86	” “
65637	65657	65635	65635	Dillon	151	” Fire burst in his eyes at that suggestion . He did n’t seem to like that one bit . “
65673	65674	65675	65675	I	0	” “
65688	65689	65681	65681	I	0	” “
65701	65706	65707	65707	You	0	” I told him . “
65734	65735	65732	65732	Jules	76	” “
65742	65913	65738	65738	You	0	” I said . I did n’t want to fight . I ’d just dropped a lot on Austin . It was unfair of me to just expect him to be okay with something I ’d been dealing with all of my adult life . Not that I was okay with anything that had happened with Dillon . Austin seemed frazzled the rest of the time as we got ready . All the tension that had left his body from the hot sex we ’d had was gone . He threw on jeans and a button - up with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows . After running product through his hair , he hustled me out of his house in my slightly damp dress . He finally conceded in letting me drive my own car , but he followed me all the way to Heidi ’s . We both parked in the driveway . He hopped out of his idling car and came around to help me out . “
65916	65926	65738	65738	You	0	” I said , leaning forward to kiss him . “
65937	65938	65928	65928	you	1374	” “
65953	65968	65941	65941	I	0	” His cupped my cheeks and dragged me into a slow , steady kiss . “
65974	65975	65972	65972	Jules	76	” “
65984	66010	65981	65981	I	0	” He sighed and looked like he wanted to say so much more , but that was when Landon stepped out of the front door . “
66027	66033	66012	66012	I	0	” Austin flipped him off . “
66038	66042	66012	66012	I	0	” Landon snickered . “
66073	66074	66079	66079	you	0	” “
66082	66100	66079	66079	you	0	” Austin asked . Landon punched him as he passed by , walking toward the Alfa Romeo . “
66105	66106	66079	66079	you	0	” “
66110	66114	66079	66079	you	0	” Austin said . “
66121	66131	66115	66116	No one	316	” Landon slid into the driver ’s side anyway . “
66141	66142	66134	66134	You	1374	” “
66154	66155	66156	66156	You	1374	” “
66160	66161	66156	66156	You	1374	” “
66167	66337	66164	66164	I	0	” Austin kissed me one more time before kicking Landon out of the driver ’s seat and zooming off toward Patrick ’s party . I sighed with relief . I was glad that conversation was done with . He had some time to hang with the guys and decompress . Hopefully , that would help him wrap his head around the truth bomb I ’d dropped on him . Now , I had to do it all over again with my girls . They deserved to know as well . Especially because , if Dillon was here in Lubbock , then no one was safe . Not really . I took a deep breath and then went inside to find Heidi and Emery . Heidi was in a hot - pink sundress with her blonde hair in long , beachy waves . Emery was in cutoff jean shorts and Converse . Apparently , I ’d chosen incorrectly for girls ’ night . Heidi arched an eyebrow at my appearance . “
66349	66353	66344	66344	Austin	68	” I smiled . “
66361	66369	66355	66355	I	0	” Emery snorted , next to Heidi . “
66374	66375	66370	66370	I	0	” “
66398	66407	66384	66384	You	1382	” It was my turn to look disbelieving . “
66418	66419	66420	66420	You	1382	” “
66423	66427	66420	66420	You	1382	” Heidi cried . “
66439	66440	66420	66420	You	1382	” “
66451	66491	66420	66420	You	1382	” I asked . Heidi and Emery shared one of their customary looks before nodding . We moved into the living room with the exposed wood beam ceiling and stone fireplace . It was stunning . Obviously custom built . “
66496	66500	66420	66420	You	1382	” Heidi asked . “
66509	66510	66420	66420	You	1382	” “
66519	66621	66420	66420	You	1382	” I frowned down at my tightly clasped fingers and then delivered the news I ’d told Austin . A weight lifted off of me as I finally got to divulge who I really was to my friends . And better yet … they did n’t hate me . They did n’t hate me for lying and hiding who I was . Dillon had always said that anyone who really got to know me could never really like me . No one other than him , of course . It was hard to dispel that poisonous voice whispering in my ear . “
66624	66632	66420	66420	You	1382	” Heidi said , shaking her head , “
66644	66645	66700	66702	This Dillon guy	1385	” “
66653	66657	66700	66702	This Dillon guy	1385	” Emery said . “
66660	66674	66700	66702	This Dillon guy	1385	” Heidi and Emery said together . They raised their hands in unison . “
66698	66699	66688	66688	he	68	” “
66710	66714	66700	66702	This Dillon guy	1385	” Emery said . “
66724	66725	66716	66716	I	0	” “
66741	66746	66728	66728	Julia	86	” Heidi chimed in . “
66756	66757	66748	66748	you	86	” “
66766	66829	66831	66831	my	0	” Emery muttered . Of course she would snag on that . She ’d gotten a full ride to Oklahoma and dropped out of her PhD program after her professor boyfriend cheated on her . She was now a high school teacher . I was n’t surprised that the idea of someone smart screwing up in such a spectacular way hurt her . “
66835	66841	66831	66831	my	0	” Not my worst either … “
66859	66863	66852	66852	you	86	” Heidi said . “
66934	66935	66936	66936	He	151	” “
66942	66946	66936	66936	He	151	” Emery said . “
66960	66961	66947	66947	He	151	” “
66970	66971	66964	66964	He	151	” “
66983	66993	66994	66996	Even the towing	1393	” Heidi said , chewing on her bottom lip . “
67026	67027	67013	67013	He	151	” “
67030	67034	67013	67013	He	151	” Emery spat . “
67044	67048	67051	67051	he	151	” Heidi said . “
67066	67073	67061	67061	him	151	” I laughed at her analogy . “
67096	67168	67090	67090	him	151	” I shuddered and closed my eyes . The last time I ’d seen Dillon flashed before my eyes . The way he ’d held me . By my hair . The way he ’d spat in my face . Literally and figuratively . The terror as he lost control . Fucked up on who knew how many drugs . Pissed at me for … God , everything . Just everything . “
67171	67183	67184	67184	You	0	” Heidi said , sinking into the cushion at my side . “
67191	67201	67184	67184	You	0	” Emery took the seat on the other side . “
67221	67222	67210	67210	You	0	” “
67233	67240	67241	67241	Em	69	” Heidi said , nudging me . “
67249	67255	67243	67243	I	0	” Emery rolled her eyes . “
67263	67264	67257	67257	you	0	” “
67271	67272	67257	67257	you	0	” “
67276	67282	67257	67257	you	0	” Emery shook her head . “
67309	67406	67300	67300	We	1397	” I wanted to believe them . I appreciated what they were saying . But they did n’t know Dillon . And , if they did , they would n’t want to get involved . I would n’t want them involved . But I smiled and nodded . I agreed to stay in and have a chill night . Emery put on Buffy the Vampire Slayer while Heidi found some sweats and a T - shirt that did actually fit me , to my utter shock . I suspected the pants at least belonged to Landon . “
67411	67423	67300	67300	We	1397	” Heidi said when she came back into the living room . “
67441	67442	67436	67436	Em	69	” “
67450	67451	67455	67455	Spike	156	” “
67461	67473	67455	67455	Spike	156	” Emery muttered something vulgar under her breath with a muffled , “
67477	67704	67455	67455	Spike	156	” and then changed the TV to a different season . Heidi piled up bowls full of ice cream so high , it rivaled Kevin McCallister in Home Alone . We all sat down and dug in . I was with Heidi . I liked bad - boy Spike . But for me … not Buffy . And that had been my problem for all of time . I always wanted the bad boys . It was as if I were marked or something . My mind drifted to Dillon , even as I tried to forget him . This was not how I ’d wanted this night to go . Not at all . But I was lucky at least . I had found friends who actually stuck by me . Girlfriends that I ’d never had before . Not even close . And a family behind me . Not a family I could n’t even claim . I chewed on my fingernail and promised myself that I ’d enjoy the rest of this night . Dillon had his own agenda . If I let him interrupt my day , then he ’d win . He wanted to throw me off and to make me feel like I was never safe . Well , I would n’t let him win . Fuck that ! Never again .
67865	67871	67858	67858	Landon	66	“ You ’re awfully quiet . ”
67872	67890	67858	67858	Landon	66	“ I do n’t like to listen to the sound of my own voice like you do . ”
67891	67902	67858	67858	Landon	66	“ Whatever , dude . It ’s more than that . ”
67903	67910	67911	67911	He	66	“ Let it go , Landon . ”
67949	67957	67958	67958	Landon	66	“ You want to talk about it ? ”
67961	67964	67958	67958	Landon	66	“ No . ”

80157	80160	80098	80098	my	0	“ Jules — ”
80161	80168	80169	80169	I	0	“ Do n’t call me that ! ”

80197	80203	80194	80194	Austin	68	“ I know . Fuck ! ”
80225	80236	80204	80204	He	68	“ I do n’t want to lose you over this . ”

80343	80348	80349	80349	I	0	“ You ca n’t . ”
80374	80378	80379	80379	he	68	“ I can , ”

80398	80413	80395	80395	I	0	“ I ’ve made my decision . Now , get out of my apartment . ”
80414	80432	80433	80433	Austin	68	“ No . Watching you walk away with him was the most terrifying moment of my life , ”
80436	80448	80433	80433	Austin	68	“ I ca n’t let that be the end of us . ”
80455	80503	80449	80449	I	0	“ You did n’t hear what the fuck happened here , Austin . But I had to back Dillon out of my apartment with a gun . So , do n’t stand there and fucking tell me that you wo n’t leave when I tell you to . ”
80513	80563	80564	80564	He	1582	“ You fucked up . You stayed at your ex ’s place , hid your alcohol use , and then went on a bender . Actions have consequences . And , right now , they prove to me that I was delusional for thinking you were serious about us . ”
80594	80656	80584	80584	He	1582	“ Dillon might be a piece of shit , but even he told the truth , and you did n’t . It proves that I ca n’t rely on anyone else . You were drunk , and you could n’t help anyone , Austin . I helped myself . I can rely on just one person , and that ’s me . ”
80718	80723	80773	80773	Austin	68	“ Julia , please … ”
80724	80769	80770	80770	I	0	“ I do n’t know what I deserve in a relationship , but it is n’t this . It ’s not a drunk or an addict or a liar . I ca n’t do this again . So , just … let me go . ”

80972	80977	80958	80958	his	66	“ She left me . ”
80978	80984	80985	80985	Landon	66	“ I … I know . ”
80988	81008	80985	80985	Landon	66	“ She ’s going through a lot . Just give her some time . She ’ll come back around . ”

81033	81077	80958	80958	his	66	“ I know that ’s probably how she sounded . Trust me , I ’ve been there . I never thought Heidi would talk to me again after the whole thing with work , but I gave it time . It worked out . ”
81078	81141	80958	80958	his	66	“ This is n’t some work bullshit that we can throw money at to fix the issue . This is a fucking ex who did a number on her so much so that she does n’t think she deserves to be loved . She just remembered what that feels like . She ’s not going to change her mind in the morning . ”
81142	81155	81156	81156	Landon	66	“ Why do n’t we wait until the morning to find out ? ”
81160	81167	81156	81156	Landon	66	“ You can sleep this off . ”
81168	81206	81207	81207	Landon	66	“ I can sleep off the alcohol , and I can sleep off the pain , but I ’m not going to wake up and suddenly be back with Jules . Not after everything that happened tonight . ”
81210	81243	81207	81207	Landon	66	“ Maybe not . But you need to heal . So , we need to get you to bed . You can come to our house , too , if you want . ”
81244	81254	81269	81269	him	66	“ No , she does n’t want me there . ”
81255	81263	81264	81264	I	0	“ Okay . Then … your place . ”
81316	81328	81329	81329	Landon	66	“ Call me if you need anything . And , Austin ? ”
81332	81335	81329	81329	Landon	66	“ Yeah ? ”
81348	81401	81336	81336	I	0	“ I ’m really sorry about tonight . I knew that you should n’t drink . I could have stopped it . I should have stopped it , and I should have seen what was happening . This is my fault . Patrick and I feel really awful that this all happened . ”
81402	81461	81462	81462	Landon	66	“ Do n’t go blaming yourself . Either of you . There ’s plenty of blame to throw around , but none of it is yours . I took the beer from that fuckface . I walked right into his plan . He might have been the catalyst , but I was the idiot who fell for it . ”
81466	81478	81462	81462	Landon	66	“ Are you sure you do n’t want me to stay ? ”
81479	81509	81510	81510	Landon	66	“ No concussion . Just a fucked up body . I ’ll be fine . Go home to your girl and … and take care of mine , okay ? ”
81612	81618	81603	81603	he	73	“ You look like shit . ”
81619	81622	81623	81623	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
81630	81637	81638	81638	Jensen	73	“ Much worse than last night . ”
81663	81674	81641	81641	He	73	“ Are you just here to make fun of me ? ”
81675	81684	81685	81685	I	0	“ Is n’t that what older brothers do ? ”
81702	81730	81699	81699	He	73	“ Come on . We need to get you to a doctor . Noah ’s at the hospital today . He said he ’d fit you in . ”
81731	81743	81699	81699	He	73	“ Great . Can we go see Julia on the way ? ”
81744	81762	81763	81763	I	0	“ Let ’s get you something to help with the pain first . Figure out Julia after . ”
81821	81837	81838	81838	Noah	71	“ We could do an X - ray , but that rib is definitely fractured , ”
81841	81872	81838	81838	Noah	71	“ You ’ll need a lot of rest and ice . Try not to breathe too shallowly . We want to make sure this does n’t turn into something worse . ”
81873	81879	81880	81880	I	0	“ Rest . My forte , ”
81886	81904	81880	81880	I	0	“ I ’ll write you a prescription for the pain . Your face has to feel horrible . ”
81905	81911	81838	81838	Noah	71	“ You ’re telling me . ”
81912	81919	81926	81926	his	71	“ Kimber told me what happened , ”
81929	81940	81926	81926	his	71	“ I hope you ’re pressing charges against that guy . ”
81941	81972	81838	81838	Noah	71	“ Oh , I am . As soon as they find him , I ’ll do everything I can to see him behind bars for what he did to Julia . ”
81973	81980	81981	81981	Noah	71	“ No less than he deserves . ”
82018	82021	82022	82022	he	73	“ Ready ? ”
82025	82036	82022	82022	he	73	“ Yeah . Let ’s get this filled . Fuck . ”
82088	82094	82095	82095	Jensen	73	“ Be careful with those , ”
82098	82106	82095	82095	Jensen	73	“ I ’m using them as indicated . ”
82107	82113	82114	82114	I	0	“ Make sure you do . ”
82129	82132	82119	82119	he	73	“ Austin … ”
82133	82136	82137	82137	I	0	“ What ? ”
82146	82158	82137	82137	I	0	“ Be careful with Julia . She might need some time . ”
82159	82194	82201	82201	his	73	“ I ’ll give her all the time she needs . But she went through one of the most traumatic experiences of her life . Would you have let Emery walk away after that ? ”
82239	82248	82224	82224	we	1607	“ Let me know if you need anything . ”
82249	82256	82257	82257	I	0	“ Sure , man . Thanks , ”
82336	82343	82326	82326	He	66	“ Hey . It ’s early . ”
82344	82364	82326	82326	He	66	“ Yeah , Jensen picked me up at the ass - crack of dawn . How ’s she doing ? ”
82365	82376	82377	82377	I	0	“ She has n’t come out of the guest room . ”
82391	82418	82385	82385	Landon	66	“ She ’s a guest here , Austin . If she wants you to leave , then you ’re going to have to listen to her . ”
82419	82425	82465	82465	Landon	66	“ I ’m your brother . ”
82426	82449	82385	82385	Landon	66	“ And , as your brother , I ’m telling you not to do anything stupid to that broken girl in there . ”

82573	82582	82561	82561	she	86	“ What do we have to talk about ? ”
82583	82587	82561	82561	she	86	“ Last night . ”

82902	82937	82938	82938	I	0	“ Why do you push me away ? Why ca n’t you accept that someone is going to be here ? Because I ’m here . I ’m not going to just go away , ”
82959	82986	82943	82943	her	86	“ You said I was n’t Dillon , and you ’re right . Show me you ’re more than that girl who got hurt by him . ”
82987	82997	82998	82998	she	86	“ I do n’t have to show you anything , ”
83004	83010	82998	82998	she	86	“ We ’re not together . ”
83011	83018	83019	83019	I	0	“ I ca n’t accept that , ”
83031	83070	83019	83019	I	0	“ I ’d take that beating a hundred times over if it meant that it did n’t end where we are right now . You ’re fire and energy and passion . You ’re not … dead inside . ”

83133	83144	83145	83145	She	86	“ Julia , you ’re not even listening to me . ”
83151	83219	83147	83147	her	86	“ You ’re trying to start an argument with me , Austin , and it ’s not going to work . I made my decision last night . I ’d appreciate it if you respected it . You told me once that love and hate were powerful emotions . You said that you had to work for indifference . So … that ’s where I ’m at . ”
83324	83331	83314	83314	She	86	“ Yes . This is Julia . ”
83346	83354	83332	83332	She	86	“ I’ll … I’ll be right down . ”
83355	83359	83360	83360	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
83376	83382	83369	83369	She	86	“ The police found Dillon . ”
83567	83572	83573	83573	Heidi	65	“ Are you ready ? ”
83582	83589	83573	83573	Heidi	65	“ Yeah . I think so . ”

83823	83899	83818	83818	I	0	“ We want to thank you for your confidence in this situation and everyone ’s help . The information about Dillon Jenkins led us straight to a place on the east side of Lubbock . He was arrested with the possession of a stolen vehicle , and his premises , where he was illegally living under the false name of Evan Brown , had cases of cocaine stashed , presumably after crossing the Mexican border . ”
83938	83945	83946	83946	she	1638	“ You do n’t seem surprised , ”
83949	83985	83946	83946	she	1638	“ How can I be ? He just got out of prison on good behavior . They could n’t crack him for dealing drugs even though he ’d been doing it since he was twelve . ”
83986	84000	84001	84001	she	1638	“ I read your statement . You were very brave , coming forward , ”
84011	84021	84001	84001	she	1638	“ You have a long history with this man . ”
84022	84030	83946	83946	she	1638	“ Yes . Where is he now ? ”
84031	84072	83946	83946	she	1638	“ Jail . And he ’ll stay there . I ca n’t think of a judge alive who would let him out on bond . Maybe if it had just been the violation of probation charge , but with everything — ”
84073	84088	84089	84089	I	0	“ I … I do n’t have to see him ? To identify him ? ”
84101	84134	84093	84094	The detective	1633	“ No , we found him in record time . We just wanted to speak with you and let you know the details since you were under a temporary order of protection . ”
84142	84150	84135	84135	I	0	“ That’s … that ’s really good . ”
84173	84185	84163	84163	his	1640	“ Detective , I see you ’re speaking with my client . ”

84230	84244	84245	84245	Jake	174	“ Come on , Julia . Let ’s go somewhere else and talk . ”
84401	84411	84412	84412	I	0	“ How much is this all going to cost ? ”
84427	84442	84416	84416	Jake	174	“ I ’m on retainer for Jensen . I would n’t worry about it . ”
84558	84608	84611	84611	him	174	“ We have a long road ahead of us , Miss Banner . But I can assure you that I ’ll do everything to see that Dillon Jenkins is behind bars for life . It would give me great pleasure to know that he could never harass you again . ”
84632	84636	84657	84657	God	73	“ Thank you . ”
84637	84641	84642	84642	I	0	“ My pleasure . ”

84857	84876	84854	84854	I	0	“ I think they wanted to get a bite to eat and pick up the Tahoe from Flips . ”
84885	84894	84877	84877	He	68	“ Apparently , Heidi snagged your keys earlier . ”
84895	84901	84854	84854	I	0	“ That sounds like her . ”
84902	84915	84916	84916	I	0	“ How do you feel ? With Dillon back where he belongs ? ”
84919	84922	84916	84916	I	0	“ Numb . ”
84923	84926	84854	84854	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
84927	84945	84854	84854	I	0	“ I know it should feel like a victory , but it feels more like a joke . ”
84946	84950	84854	84854	I	0	“ How so ? ”
84951	84973	84854	84854	I	0	“ Like I ’ll wake up , and thinking I ’m safe from him is the punch line to a joke . ”
84974	84985	84854	84854	I	0	“ I do n’t think that ’s going to happen . ”
84986	84994	84995	84995	I	0	“ Does n’t change how I feel . ”
85040	85049	85033	85033	I	0	“ You wanted to drive her , right ? ”
85059	85068	85050	85050	I	0	“ You never let anyone drive your car . ”
85069	85073	85077	85077	he	68	“ I know . ”

85268	85273	85305	85305	His	68	“ Exhilarating , right ? ”
85274	85288	85289	85289	Austin	68	“ Like flying without the fear of heights that comes with actual flying . ”
85320	85357	85316	85316	He	68	“ I do n’t understand , Julia . Dillon is behind bars . You ’re safe again . You can move on with your life . You do n’t have to be tied to his shadow . ”
85358	85368	85369	85369	He	68	“ You know why I ’m afraid of heights ? ”
85378	85381	85369	85369	He	68	“ No . ”
85382	85462	85316	85316	He	68	“ Well , I always was . But it was really more the fear of falling . I had dreams of falling endlessly , like Alice when she went down a rabbit hole . But Dillon found out about my fear , about how much I hated heights . Then , he spent the next couple of years terrorizing me … apparently , in a way to get rid of my fear . Fear is weakness and all that . ”
85477	85515	85516	85516	I	0	“ What put me over the edge the day that I decided to get out was because he took me to the top of our apartment building at the time and dangled me there by my wrist . ”

85540	85580	85316	85316	He	68	“ My fear did n’t go away just because he ’d dragged me up to the top of the building . My fear of Dillon is n’t going to disappear just because he ca n’t reach me anymore either . ”
85581	85586	85516	85516	I	0	“ I understand that . ”
85587	85591	85592	85592	I	0	“ Do you ? ”
85595	85613	85592	85592	I	0	“ Because I do n’t think you understand . I do n’t want us to be together . ”

85628	85683	85684	85684	I	0	“ Just because Dillon is behind bars … doesn’t change any of the other reasons I broke up with you . I wish it did , but if I ’m not going to be the victim anymore , then I have to apply that to all things in my life . I ’m sorry . ”

86933	86950	86924	86924	She	115	“ There ’ll be time for that . But maybe you should let me inside first . ”
86971	86992	86958	86958	she	115	“ What the hell happened to your house ? Did Julia ’s ex do this to your house , too ? ”
86993	87000	86951	86951	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”

88180	88198	88199	88199	He	72	“ Okay . But it ’s not going to take long . Jensen is waiting for me . ”
88221	88227	88228	88228	I	0	“ Still having trouble driving ? ”
88235	88242	88228	88228	I	0	“ No . I ’m leaving . ”

88256	88299	88300	88300	He	72	“ Yeah . Jensen is taking me to rehab . I ’m going to be gone for the next three months at an inpatient facility . Jensen set it all up . But I wanted to see you . I , uh … ”

88441	88463	88424	88424	He	72	“ Jensen did n’t even think that I should stop and talk to you before going , but I had to . ”
88464	88472	88424	88424	He	72	“ Even though we ’re broken up ? ”
88473	88481	88482	88482	I	0	“ Especially because we ’re broken up . ”
88491	88516	88482	88482	I	0	“ Well , I ’m glad you ’re going . I think it ’s a really good idea . I hope it helps you . ”

88528	88531	88424	88424	He	72	“ About ? ”
88532	88535	88536	88536	He	72	“ Everything . ”
88545	88592	88536	88536	He	72	“ You and Jensen and my family and everyone . You all saw me for what I was and what I was doing to myself . I did n’t really realize until this morning . I ’d thought I did , but I was fooling myself . ”
88593	88601	88602	88602	He	72	“ What made you see the light ? ”
88605	88612	88602	88602	He	72	“ Just … hear me out . ”
88635	88641	88642	88642	I	0	“ What did you do ? ”
88648	88682	88642	88642	I	0	“ I emptied the rest of the bottles in my house last night and mixed them with the pain pills I ’d gotten from Noah . It was stupid , but I just … ”
88690	88726	88685	88685	his	72	“ I defaulted to how I always acted . I was so fucking hurt . After I ’d gotten the shit beat out of me , you broke up with me . Just abandoned me . ”
88727	88730	88776	88776	He	1715	“ Austin — ”
88731	88775	88685	88685	his	72	“ No , no , I ’m not mad at you . Well , not anymore . I get your reasons . I get why you did it . I get why you do n’t trust me . I do n’t trust me . ”
88792	88828	88788	88788	he	1715	“ I wanted to go back to not feeling . I did n’t know how to feel this intensely . I did n’t know how to react to what I felt without finding the bottle . ”
88835	88859	88829	88829	He	1715	“ But that is n’t why I ’m here . I ’m just … fuck , I really want to avoid this conversation . ”
88882	88886	88873	88873	I	0	“ Tell me . ”
88887	88898	88899	88899	I	0	“ When I got drunk , I invited Maggie over . ”
88905	88908	88899	88899	I	0	“ Wow . ”

88949	88971	88937	88937	he	1715	“ Get out of my fucking way . You do n’t get to come here and throw that bullshit at me . ”
88972	88977	88978	88978	he	1715	“ I ’m not , ”
88981	88989	88978	88978	he	1715	“ I did n’t sleep with her . ”
88990	89001	88937	88937	he	1715	“ And you expect me to believe you ? Again ? ”
89002	89064	88937	88937	he	1715	“ I ’m not asking you to get back together with me , Julia . I ’m not even asking you to forgive me . I hardly forgive myself for even inviting her over . I ’m asking you to listen . You can call Maggie yourself if you want . Though you ’re probably not her favorite person right now . ”
89065	89073	89074	89074	I	0	“ I ’m not her favorite person ? ”
89101	89119	89120	89120	he	72	“ No , you ’re not . Because I invited her over . We … made out , ”
89129	89186	89120	89120	he	72	“ And I thought that being with her would make me forget you . But she was all wrong . Nothing could make me forget you . No one else could ever be you . I realized too late that you are perfect for me . Perfect for me in ways I had n’t even known . ”
89187	89207	89288	89288	his	1716	“ That does n’t make up for what you did . We ’d been broken up for a day ! ”
89208	89280	89281	89281	He	1716	“ I know , I know . It was stupid . I got wasted , like I always did , and did shit that I had done back when I was so fucked up all the time . But I did n’t sleep with Maggie . I feel bad enough that we even kissed . That I even thought that I ’d be able to get you out of my head . ”
89301	89356	89296	89296	he	1716	“ I told her to leave . I told her how I felt about you . That I never had feelings for her . That I ’d never have feelings for her , and all of this was a mistake . I was n’t particularly eloquent , as I was drunk off my ass . ”
89357	89372	89373	89373	I	0	“ I do n’t even know why you came here to tell me this , ”
89378	89384	89373	89373	I	0	“ Why you even bothered . ”
89385	89419	89296	89296	he	1716	“ Because I wanted the truth out there . I did n’t want to hold out on telling you and you find out from someone else . For you to think the worst . ”
89420	89424	89425	89425	I	0	“ Too late , ”
89428	89435	89436	89436	he	1717	“ Yeah , I deserve that , ”
89439	89483	89436	89436	he	1717	“ You were right about me . And , when I woke up , hungover and alone , this morning , I realized that I had proven every fear you had about me right . That I was a drunk , lying addict . ”
89484	89487	89488	89488	I	0	“ Asshole , ”
89493	89519	89488	89488	I	0	“ That , too . You have every reason to hate me . I am all those things , and you deserve better than me . ”
89520	89537	89538	89538	I	0	“ So , you ’re going to rehab to try to be the man I deserve ? ”
89558	89619	89538	89538	I	0	“ No , I fully understand that this might be the last time I see you . I do n’t want to accept that , but I can eventually if that ’s what you really want . But I ’m going to rehab for me . To be the man I want to be … that I need to be . ”
89681	89692	89693	89693	Austin	72	“ So , I guess I ’m going to go , ”
89716	89758	89696	89696	His	72	“ I ’ll be out of here for the next ninety days at least . Plenty of time for you to figure out if you want anything to do with me . But just do n’t forget about me , okay ? ”
89759	89770	89696	89696	His	72	“ Austin , I ’m not giving you any promises . ”
89771	89795	89796	89796	He	72	“ I do n’t want you to . I want you to know that you ’re the most important thing in my life . ”
89817	89827	89813	89813	He	72	“ I ’m sorry I realized that too late . ”
89948	89954	89938	89938	Heidi	65	“ Did he just leave ? ”
89955	89958	89959	89959	I	0	“ Yeah , ”

89993	89998	89999	89999	Heidi	65	“ Oh , wow , ”
90002	90007	89999	89999	Heidi	65	“ Are you serious ? ”
90022	90033	90019	90019	I	0	“ Yeah . Can I ask you for a favor ? ”
90034	90038	90039	90039	Landon	66	“ Of course , ”
90042	90047	90039	90039	Landon	66	“ What ’s up ? ”
90048	90057	90058	90058	He	66	“ Will you get me Maggie ’s number ? ”
90061	90066	90058	90058	He	66	“ Uh , why ? ”
90067	90079	90039	90039	Landon	66	“ Because I need to make a very important phone call . ”
90216	90229	90230	90230	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe we just flew to California for this , ”
90233	90242	90243	90243	Jensen	73	“ Well , it ’s not a vacation , ”
90253	90258	90243	90243	Jensen	73	“ Of course not . ”
90259	90295	90243	90243	Jensen	73	“ I got you the best treatment available . This is where all the top celebrities go because it offers them the privacy they need to get better . You deserve nothing less than that . ”
90317	90322	90307	90307	he	73	“ Thanks , Jensen . ”
90339	90343	90344	90345	a man	1322	“ Mr. Wright , ”
90351	90356	90357	90357	I	0	“ Yes , Austin , ”
90364	90371	90344	90345	a man	1322	“ And you must be Jensen . ”
90372	90377	90344	90345	a man	1322	“ That ’s right . ”
90378	90409	90344	90345	a man	1322	“ I ’m Bartholomew . We ’re glad to have you here . Right this way , and we ’ll get you checked in and settled into your new villa . ”
90424	90474	90412	90412	I	0	“ We want you to be as comfortable as possible . We think treatment should n’t be in a hospital - like setting where more stress could fracture your recovery . We just want to help you succeed , and everything we do here is focused on that goal . ”
90475	90478	90479	90479	I	0	“ Great , ”
90487	90531	90483	90484	The man	1323	“ You ’ll fit right in here . Everyone has that same tone when they first get here . But , while it might seem luxurious , your days will be packed with activities and therapy to get you on the right track . ”
90548	90559	90543	90543	he	73	“ That ’s excellent . I ’d expect nothing less . ”

91075	91090	91091	91091	Landon	66	“ I ’d be more okay with it if you helped move this couch , ”
91094	91099	91100	91100	I	0	“ Shit , sorry , ”
91107	91115	91116	91116	Heidi	65	“ We really should have hired someone , ”
91119	91128	91116	91116	Heidi	65	“ My back is going to love this , ”
91132	91138	91139	91139	Heidi	65	“ Aw , poor baby , ”
91142	91163	91139	91139	Heidi	65	“ Can you keep your lovey - dovey bullshit to yourselves until after we get this couch out the door ? ”
91170	91176	91167	91167	Heidi	65	“ No apologies from me . ”
91182	91196	91177	91177	Morgan	78	“ Just keep all this shit to a minimum when Sutton gets here . ”
91197	91202	91203	91203	I	0	“ She ’s coming ? ”
91220	91223	91208	91208	I	0	“ Fuck ! ”
91224	91253	91254	91254	Morgan	78	“ Yeah , Jensen and Emery are bringing her . We ’re trying to get her out of the house some . Kimber said she ’d watch Jason , ”
91257	91260	91261	91261	I	0	“ Wow , ”
91264	91270	91261	91261	I	0	“ How has she been ? ”

91554	91561	91562	91562	she	88	“ Do you love my brother ? ”
91586	91597	91579	91579	She	88	“ I do n’t know if it ’s that simple . ”
91598	91609	91610	91610	She	88	“ I heard how much of an idiot he was . ”
91622	91655	91656	91656	She	88	“ But , if you love him — and I assure you that he loves you — and you let him go because of his relapse , then you ’re the idiot . ”
91659	91684	91656	91656	She	88	“ I ’m just saying … you never know how much time you have together . Forgiving someone is easier than living without them . ”
91733	91736	91737	91737	Morgan	78	“ Austin ! ”
91755	91777	91744	91744	She	78	“ Man , I ’ve missed you . I did n’t realize how quiet it would be without you cutting up . ”
91784	91793	91778	91778	I	0	“ I ’ll take that as a compliment . ”
91794	91799	91800	91800	Landon	66	“ You look good , ”
91817	91823	91824	91824	I	0	“ Not good but better , ”
91846	91851	91852	91852	I	0	“ Hey , sis , ”
91896	91916	91917	91917	She	292	“ Are they feeding you ? Because I have a personal chef here , and he ’s the shit . ”
91922	91938	91917	91917	She	292	“ I eat . Do n’t worry about me . We ’re here for you . ”
91948	91964	91939	91939	Jensen	73	“ I think I like this place even better than when I dropped you off . ”
91965	91971	91972	91972	It	1755	“ It grows on you . ”
92099	92103	92104	92104	I	0	“ No Patrick ? ”
92107	92114	92115	92115	Morgan	78	“ He could n’t make it , ”
92118	92132	92115	92115	Morgan	78	“ He has a big work project . His boss is a bitch . ”
92136	92148	92133	92133	I	0	“ You ’re not a bitch . You ’re just efficient . ”
92149	92161	92115	92115	Morgan	78	“ He ’ll be here next time . Do n’t worry . ”
92162	92169	92170	92170	I	0	“ Good . And … Julia ? ”
92250	92266	92246	92246	Landon	66	“ She ’s doing good . She ’s just still … I do n’t know . ”
92267	92273	92274	92274	Sutton	88	“ She needs more time , ”
92277	92283	92246	92246	Landon	66	“ But she misses you . ”
92284	92289	92290	92290	I	0	“ She said that ? ”
92294	92303	92290	92290	I	0	“ No , but I know she does . ”
92304	92307	92308	92308	I	0	“ Oh . ”
92341	92353	92336	92336	I	0	“ Well then … why do n’t I show you around ? ”
92447	92460	92438	92438	Morgan	78	“ I could just take a nap . I ’m so tired . ”
92461	92465	92506	92506	She	78	“ I bet . ”
92466	92473	92506	92506	She	78	“ Work is … a mess . ”
92474	92482	92438	92438	Morgan	78	“ Have you hired a new CFO ? ”
92509	92541	92506	92506	She	78	“ We put out an offer to David Calloway this past weekend . I ’m sure we ’ll have to negotiate the contract , and then he ’ll start next week . ”
92542	92565	92506	92506	She	78	“ You made the right choice . David seems like a great guy . I really liked him when I met him . ”
92566	92572	92506	92506	She	78	“ You ’re not upset ? ”
92573	92581	92582	92582	I	0	“ That I ’m not the CFO ? ”
92589	92614	92582	92582	I	0	“ No . No , I ’m definitely not . I was stupid to think that was what I wanted in the first place . ”
92615	92636	92637	92637	I	0	“ No , it was n’t stupid . We ’re Wrights . We are the company . Jensen knows that . ”
92672	92717	92734	92734	She	1778	“ I was n’t ready for that job . Jensen knew that , too . I ’d rather you have someone like David , who already knows his stuff , and you can train him . It ’ll be easier than working with me . ”
92718	92730	92731	92731	she	1778	“ A month in here , and you ’re this sensible ? ”
92744	92754	92734	92734	She	1778	“ Who will you be when you come out ? ”
92755	92759	92734	92734	She	1778	“ Same me . ”
92760	92770	92734	92734	She	1778	“ I do n’t believe that for one minute . ”
92771	92775	92776	92776	I	0	“ Sober me , ”
92779	92791	92776	92776	I	0	“ What are you going to do when you get out ? ”
92792	92805	92806	92806	Morgan	78	“ I do n’t know . Will I still have my job ? ”
92811	92818	92806	92806	Morgan	78	“ Do you still want it ? ”
92819	92889	92890	92890	I	0	“ If I ’ve learned anything from this experience so far , it ’s that I did n’t appreciate a goddamn thing about my life before this . That job was a godsend , and I treated it like a joke . I felt entitled to whatever I wanted without having to work for it . That is n’t real life . But I love that company , Morgan . ”
92896	92908	92890	92890	I	0	“ Maybe as much as you do . I always have . ”
92909	92922	92806	92806	Morgan	78	“ Then your job is waiting for you when you get back . ”
92923	92942	92890	92890	I	0	“ Thank you . I know I probably do n’t deserve that , but I do appreciate it . ”
92951	92966	92967	92967	I	0	“ You want to change ? Or are you going to take that nap ? ”
92988	92994	92982	92982	she	78	“ Let ’s join them . ”
92995	93005	92970	92970	Morgan	78	“ All right . I ’ll get a suit . ”
93006	93009	92982	92982	she	78	“ Austin ? ”
93010	93013	92982	92982	she	78	“ Hmm ? ”
93014	93028	93029	93029	I	0	“ What are you going to do about Julia when you get back ? ”
93040	93048	93029	93029	I	0	“ Appreciate the fuck out of her . ”
93448	93452	93453	93453	I	0	“ What the … ”
93518	93521	93522	93522	I	0	“ Jesus , ”
94217	94219	94214	94225	that guy who “ won ” me Waffle in the first place	1803	“ won ”
94770	94790	94763	94763	Jensen	73	“ I wonder if some of this goes back to the fact that you were there when Mom died . ”
94791	94799	94800	94800	Sutton	88	“ You were there when Mom died ? ”
94816	94819	94820	94820	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
94830	94842	94820	94820	I	0	“ I was with her … or … well , yeah . ”
94843	94852	94857	94857	He	1796	“ Tell us more about that , Austin , ”
94872	94876	94857	94857	He	1796	“ About Mom ? ”
94877	94888	94889	94889	Morgan	78	“ I did n’t know you were with her either , ”
94892	94896	94897	94897	Landon	66	“ Me either , ”
94916	94932	94909	94909	He	73	“ It ’s okay . We ’re not Dad . We can talk about Mom . ”
94938	95005	94933	94933	I	0	“ Okay . Well , I had n’t known how sick Mom was . Dad did n’t like to talk about it , and Mom tried to hide it . She was the perfect wife and mother . She was still cooking , cleaning , and taking care of us kids through chemo . It was a pretty traditional marriage by that standard , I guess . ”
95041	95063	95064	95064	I	0	“ I did n’t even know about the pancreatic cancer until she died when I was nine . Maybe you did , ”
95071	95079	95064	95064	I	0	“ but I was in the dark . ”
95080	95084	95085	95085	he	73	“ I guessed , ”
95088	95109	95085	95085	he	73	“ It definitely was n’t what Dad had said it was , but he was n’t ever honest with us . ”
95110	95117	95118	95118	Landon	66	“ No , he was n’t , ”
95121	95131	95132	95132	I	0	“ She was n’t even supposed to have it , ”
95135	95155	95132	95132	I	0	“ She was so young . Only thirty - five . With five children , ages twelve to one . ”
95156	95163	95164	95165	the therapist	1812	“ That had to be hard , ”
95168	95172	95164	95165	the therapist	1812	“ It was . ”
95212	95279	95195	95195	Jensen	73	“ I was watching her one day . Dad had told me to stay with her . She was sick and got into bed . I remember telling her that I would n’t nap with her because I did n’t want to catch her cold . I went out to play instead of staying with her , and when I came back , she was gone . ”
95280	95285	95286	95286	Morgan	78	“ Oh , Austin , ”
95290	95297	95286	95286	Morgan	78	“ That is n’t your fault . ”
95298	95305	95306	95307	the therapist	1812	“ I agree with your sister , ”
95310	95346	95306	95307	the therapist	1812	“ As a nine - year - old boy , you were not responsible for the care of your terminally ill mother . It ’s perfectly reasonable that you wanted to go outside and play . ”
95347	95386	95195	95195	Jensen	73	“ Logically , of course , I know that . But I was n’t logical . I covered up my distress as a kid and through my teen years . I looked adjusted . Maybe I was adjusted . ”
95387	95408	95286	95286	Morgan	78	“ Of course . It sounds like you internalized the issue . When did you start drinking regularly after that ? ”
95409	95414	95306	95307	the therapist	1812	“ After Dad died . ”
95415	95421	95422	95423	the therapist	1812	“ Tell us about that , ”
95426	95447	95448	95448	I	0	“ I was twenty and in college at Tech . I was at a bar when I got the news , ”
95462	95480	95448	95448	I	0	“ So , you were around alcohol when you found out about the death of another parent ? ”
95481	95484	95485	95485	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
95488	95530	95485	95485	I	0	“ I remember thinking about all the stuff that had happened with my mom , and suddenly , I just … I could n’t cope . Not that any of that is an excuse . I suppose it ’s my reason . ”
95531	95534	95535	95535	Landon	66	“ Shit , ”
95538	95543	95544	95544	Morgan	78	“ That ’s awful , ”
95574	95580	95581	95581	Jensen	73	“ I did n’t realize , ”
95584	95606	95581	95581	Jensen	73	“ All this time , you were self - medicating over Mom ’s death , and you were n’t even responsible . ”
95607	95614	95615	95616	the therapist	1812	“ This feels like a breakthrough , ”
95619	95630	95615	95616	the therapist	1812	“ Something we can work with from here on out . ”
96000	96006	96007	96007	Heidi	65	“ How do you feel ? ”
96010	96013	96007	96007	Heidi	65	“ Amazing . ”
96014	96035	96036	96036	Emery	69	“ God , I ’m so glad that asshole will be behind bars for the rest of his miserable life , ”
96039	96045	96036	96036	Emery	69	“ You and me both . ”
96046	96063	96064	96064	Heidi	65	“ If you ’re so happy … then how come you do n’t exactly sound happy ? ”
96067	96073	96064	96064	Heidi	65	“ I do n’t know . ”
96086	96094	96095	96095	Heidi	65	“ I need to write to Austin . ”
96104	96112	96113	96113	Heidi	65	“ What did he say this time ? ”
96116	96127	96128	96128	Emery	69	“ And how are n’t you swooning over these letters ? ”
96144	96155	96156	96156	Heidi	65	“ Counting down the days until I see you again , ”
96160	96172	96156	96156	Heidi	65	“ Is he for real ? Jesus , these Wright men . ”
96173	96180	96181	96181	I	0	“ I wish he were here , ”
96201	96223	96224	96224	Heidi	65	“ He ’s going to be out of rehab soon . What are you going to do when he gets out ? ”
96227	96242	96224	96224	Heidi	65	“ We ’ll have to see when he gets here , wo n’t we ? ”
96243	96256	96257	96257	Heidi	65	“ But … do you want to get back together with him ? ”
96260	96268	96269	96269	Emery	69	“ God , Heidi , so nosy , ”
96272	96284	96269	96269	Emery	69	“ Do n’t act like you ’re not dying to know ! ”
96285	96305	96306	96306	I	0	“ Well , yeah , I am . But I ’m going to wait for her to tell us . ”
96309	96316	96306	96306	I	0	“ You two are so ridiculous . ”
96317	96320	96321	96321	Heidi	65	“ Truth . ”

96337	96342	96343	96343	Heidi	65	“ So … Julia ? ”
96346	96375	96343	96343	Heidi	65	“ It ’s been three months since I ’ve seen him . The letters are … everything . I just wo n’t know though until I see him . ”

96976	96982	96973	96973	She	1858	“ You gave me permission . ”
96983	96989	96940	96940	she	1858	“ That was one time ! ”
96990	97005	97006	97006	She	1858	“ Well , she handles like a dream . I might even keep her . ”
97011	97018	97006	97006	She	1858	“ Red really is my color . ”
97019	97026	97027	97027	I	0	“ Fuck , I missed you , ”
97035	97040	97027	97027	I	0	“ Oh , yeah ? ”
97047	97051	97041	97041	Her	1858	“ Every day . ”

97111	97121	97077	97077	She	1858	“ Long . I was ready to come home . ”
97122	97129	97130	97130	I	0	“ But you needed to stay ? ”
97133	97156	97130	97130	I	0	“ I needed the whole time . And probably years more of outpatient treatment to make sure I do n’t relapse again . ”
97157	97166	97167	97167	she	1858	“ You think that ’s going to happen ? ”
97175	97186	97172	97172	her	1858	“ Not if I have anything to say about it . ”
97187	97193	97172	97172	her	1858	“ I like hearing that . ”
97321	97330	97331	97331	I	0	“ It ’s really good to see you , ”
97354	97365	97348	97348	she	1858	“ I know . I ’m glad you ’re back . ”
97377	97385	97373	97373	she	1858	“ But you have a runaway suitcase . ”

97439	97447	97448	97448	She	182	“ Thanks for the heads - up . ”
97473	97480	97481	97481	she	182	“ I brought you a present , ”
97492	97497	97498	97498	She	182	“ What ’s that ? ”
97529	97557	97520	97520	Julia	182	“ I ’ve had custody for two months . I think it ’s your turn to pitch in . Do n’t want to be a neglectful parent . ”
97558	97565	97614	97614	Her	182	“ Would n’t dream of it . ”
97566	97574	97575	97575	she	182	“ So , back to your house ? ”
97578	97585	97575	97575	she	182	“ Actually … I sold it . ”

98096	98144	98145	98145	Julia	182	“ They were the only other things of value I had with me . My therapist got me the box as a going - away present . It ’s from a Buddhist healing temple or hippie community or something . Not sure , but it ’s handmade . ”
98148	98159	98145	98145	Julia	182	“ It ’s perfect . Your therapist has good taste . ”

99466	99535	99337	99337	her	182	“ I do n’t like how you reacted when you hit rock bottom or that I was hurt when you did it . But I ca n’t ignore that you ’ve done everything to make yourself better , and that includes with me . I was n’t sure how I felt , and then I saw you . Now , I know that I want to try again . ”

100380	100405	100366	100366	Sutton	88	“ I just … I’m glad someone else was here for that . I did n’t know if I could do another thing alone . ”
100406	100409	100410	100410	Austin	182	“ Well , ”
100413	100436	100410	100410	Austin	182	“ if you ever need anything , even just a night off , then give me a call . You deserve it . ”

100451	100495	100448	100448	I	0	“ I appreciate it . Most days , it ’s okay . But holidays are the worst . So , it was good to have you here . I think I ’m going to try to crash some while he ’s actually asleep . ”

101122	101169	101219	101219	his	1930	“ I knew it would feel like this . Or at least , I was warned about it . But it ’s one thing to talk about it in rehab and another thing to experience it in person . Just something I have to live with . ”
101170	101186	101219	101219	his	1930	“ At least you ’re making an effort to make new memories . Sober memories . ”
101187	101211	101212	101212	I	0	“ Yeah , I feel like I wasted most of the last ten years . I do n’t want to miss anything else . ”

102087	102099	102100	102100	He	1930	“ Guess I ’m not a Captain America guy after all . ”
102172	102182	102183	102183	he	1930	“ God , I want to get inside you , ”
102186	102198	102183	102183	he	1930	“ Want you to know just how much I love you . ”
102328	102331	102332	102332	I	0	“ What ? ”
102335	102342	102332	102332	I	0	“ It ’s different this time . ”
