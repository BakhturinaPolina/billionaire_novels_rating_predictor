1087	1093	1094	1094	Angie	67	“ One is for staff , ”

1196	1212	1176	1176	Angie	67	“ You ca n’t still like them . You ate nothing but for two years . ”
1323	1337	1338	1338	Angie	67	“ But now that you have a home , things can be different , ”
1405	1459	1460	1460	She	67	“ Even this wallpaper feels like it cost a million bucks . You ’re going to need to spend some money . I think Ikea stuff is going to look a little weird in this place . I do n’t even know where you ’d shop for things for a place like this . ”
1469	1479	1460	1460	She	67	“ What are you going to do for furniture ? ”
1480	1505	1506	1506	I	0	“ I have my couch being delivered tomorrow . And I bought a mattress and some kitchen stuff from Ikea . I ’m done . ”

1539	1546	1531	1531	she	67	“ You ’re bringing it here ? ”
1547	1576	1596	1596	she	67	“ Well , your husband would n’t help me move it , so no , I ’m not bringing it here . It ’s being delivered tomorrow morning . ”
1577	1580	1581	1581	Angie	67	“ Unbelievable . ”
1589	1592	1583	1583	her	67	“ What ? ”
1611	1621	1605	1605	I	0	“ This place must have cost you ten million . ”
1647	1671	1672	1672	Angie	67	“ And you ’re buying an Ikea bed and having a fifty - year - old Craigslist sofa delivered ? What the fuck ? ”
1698	1726	1727	1727	I	0	“ Furniture does n’t make me money . This place is an investment — one I can live in so I do n’t have to pay rent . ”
1815	1837	1807	1807	Angie	67	“ Seriously , you need some stuff . Like vases . Or pillows . Something to make the place . . . ”
1838	1863	1864	1864	Angie	67	“ If it makes you feel any better , I ’ve hired an art consultant and we ’re going to a gallery this evening . ”
1870	1875	1867	1867	her	67	“ A what consultant ? ”
1876	1889	1890	1890	I	0	“ Someone who ’s going to find some pictures for the walls . ”
1914	1923	1924	1924	She	67	“ Because art is an investment , right ? ”
1929	1932	1926	1926	her	67	“ So ? ”
1936	1946	1933	1933	I	0	“ Does n’t mean it wo n’t look nice . ”
1947	1991	1926	1926	her	67	“ I think it ’s a good idea , but you ca n’t just sit on your beat - up sofa in this huge apartment with expensive art on the walls . If you ’re going to do it , go for it . ”
1992	2002	2003	2003	Angie	67	“ I do n’t care if it looks weird . ”
2018	2031	2010	2010	She	67	“ Surely all that matters is that I have what I need . ”
2032	2065	2066	2066	She	67	“ Need ? You do n’t need an apartment on Park Avenue or five bedrooms or two kitchens . But that ’s okay . All I ’m saying is relax a little . ”
2089	2146	2081	2081	she	67	“ You ’ve earned it . You do n’t have to be overly indulgent , but get some things that will make your life more comfortable . This is New York fucking City . If such a thing as an art consultant exists , there must be someone who buys furniture for rich dudes like you . ”
2147	2154	2156	2156	she	67	“ My life is very comfortable . ”
2159	2170	2156	2156	she	67	“ This is Park Avenue , for Christ ’s sake . ”
2171	2196	2197	2197	she	67	“ Okay , what about when you bring women back ? You ca n’t fuck them on a mattress you threw on the floor , ”
2207	2225	2200	2200	she	67	“ I ’ve never brought a woman back to my place . Why would that change now ? ”
2226	2238	2239	2239	Angie	67	“ That ’s because you ’ve always lived in a hovel , ”
2255	2269	2249	2249	she	67	“ Now you do n’t have to be ashamed of where you live . ”
2270	2332	2249	2249	she	67	“ Hey , I ’ve never been ashamed of where I live . I ’ve always paid my rent — that ’s nothing to be ashamed of . And I do n’t bring women back to my place because it means I can get up and leave any time I want . There ’s no way that ’s going to change . ”
2333	2341	2342	2342	she	67	“ Just think about it . Please , ”
2486	2497	2498	2498	Harper	68	“ You know you ’re not the painter , right ? ”
2507	2519	2520	2520	I	0	“ I ’m touching up the walls where they ’re scuffed , ”
2533	2545	2546	2546	I	0	“ And I do n’t want you resting on your laurels . ”

2650	2661	2633	2633	I	0	“ But I ca n’t decide where they should go . ”
2685	2690	2691	2691	Harper	68	“ Does it matter ? ”
2699	2714	2694	2694	her	68	“ We do n’t want his shitty work to sell anyway , do we ? ”
2925	2939	2940	2940	Steve	69	“ Really ? Is he good or do you just like banging him ? ”
3022	3028	3029	3029	she	70	“ This is so exciting , ”
3039	3045	3029	3029	she	70	“ Shame about the artist . ”
3046	3049	3050	3050	I	0	“ Hey , ”
3053	3080	3050	3050	I	0	“ You ca n’t say that . I need the place to be a sellout . I have this quarter ’s rent to pay next week . ”
3239	3247	3248	3248	Scarlett	70	“ You can always ask your dad , ”
3251	3258	3248	3248	Scarlett	70	“ If it gets too much . ”
3277	3285	3286	3286	Harper	68	“ She ’s not asking her father , ”
3291	3300	3286	3286	Harper	68	“ She ’s doing this on her own . ”
3360	3388	3389	3389	I	0	“ I just have to separate how I feel about Steve personally from my business goals . I ’m not going to like every client I have . ”
3468	3475	3476	3476	I	0	“ This needs to go here . ”
3495	3502	3503	3503	I	0	“ It ’s the most expensive . ”
3552	3556	3557	3557	I	0	“ And this , ”
3568	3574	3557	3557	I	0	“ should go over here . ”
3591	3599	3600	3600	Scarlett	70	“ Are you shutting off the back ? ”
3794	3796	3747	3747	I	0	“ hot ”
3812	3833	3834	3834	I	0	“ I think I ’ll keep the whole place open , just in case anyone ’s interested in anything else . ”
3876	3879	3880	3880	I	0	“ Right . ”
3888	3907	3880	3880	I	0	“ Can you help me move the tables so there ’s more of a flow into the back ? ”
3988	3993	3994	3994	Harper	68	“ You look great , ”
4012	4017	3994	3994	Harper	68	“ Are you ready ? ”
4074	4087	4057	4057	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m ready . I just hope people come . ”
4205	4212	4213	4213	Harper	68	“ Of course they ’ll come , ”
4216	4224	4213	4213	Harper	68	“ You have an eye for talent . ”
4258	4270	4271	4271	I	0	“ Can you go stand over by the door with that ? ”
4278	4286	4271	4271	I	0	“ People should be arriving any minute . ”
4348	4358	4359	4359	I	0	“ Melanie , so nice of you to come , ”
4427	4437	4438	4438	She	286	“ Of course , I would n’t miss it . ”
4442	4454	4438	4438	She	286	“ This is a great place you have here , darling . ”
4455	4459	4438	4438	She	286	“ Thank you . ”
4551	4561	4562	4562	I	0	“ Let me show you this artist ’s work , ”
4579	4589	4562	4562	I	0	“ I think you ’re going to love him . ”
4876	4884	4885	4885	I	0	“ Nina , I ’m Grace Astor , ”
4914	4923	4909	4909	she	73	“ I ’m so pleased you could come . ”
5054	5066	5067	5067	Nina	73	“ Ms. Astor , this is my client , Sam Shaw . ”
5109	5121	5122	5122	He	318	“ Mr. Shaw , it ’s very nice to meet you . ”
5149	5168	5169	5169	Nina	73	“ Grace , this artist tonight is just on the cusp of breaking out , is n’t he ? ”
5193	5216	5186	5186	I	0	“ That ’s right . There ’s a real buzz about him at the moment and some very important collectors here tonight . ”
5232	5248	5186	5186	I	0	“ He ’s a very painterly painter who clearly has his roots in abstract expressionism . ”
5273	5276	5277	5277	Steve	69	“ Gracie , ”
5302	5311	5312	5312	I	0	“ Let me introduce you to the artist , ”
5326	5331	5315	5315	Steve	69	“ Hey , Gracie . ”
5332	5343	5347	5347	I	0	“ Steve , please meet Mr. Shaw and Nina Grecco . ”
5372	5384	5385	5385	I	0	“ I was just going to tell them about this piece . ”
5392	5403	5385	5385	I	0	“ Do you want to give us some more background ? ”
5450	5463	5430	5430	Steve	69	“ Ms. Astor , would you please show me around your gallery ? ”
5492	5500	5501	5501	Nina	73	“ Do you want me to come ? ”
5504	5511	5501	5501	Nina	73	“ We ’ll manage just fine , ”
5520	5525	5526	5526	Steve	69	“ Lead the way . ”
5555	5567	5568	5568	I	0	“ This space at the back has a mixture of artists , ”
5583	5592	5575	5575	his	76	“ What kind of art do you like ? ”
5680	5686	5677	5677	his	69	“ I have no idea . ”
5850	5858	5859	5859	he	69	“ Is this part of it too ? ”
5862	5892	5893	5893	He	69	“ Part of the gallery ? Yes . But the work behind the partition does n’t really fit with the rest of the pieces . I just like them . ”
5913	5926	5908	5908	I	0	“ This is a La Touche . An impressionist oil painting . And this”—I
5930	5960	5910	5910	his	69	Degas—“is an original lithograph , signed by Degas , who , as you probably know , was famous for painting ballerinas . He was a contemporary of La Touche . ”
5961	5965	5966	5966	He	69	“ And these ? ”
5974	6037	6038	6038	He	69	“ These are recent and not particularly valuable , but the photographer was homeless for a period of time , and I think you can see it in his work . He takes pictures of New York through the eyes of someone who ’s slept on the street . He sees the contrast between the beauty and the harshness this city offers . ”
6052	6069	6070	6070	he	69	“ And you like them because of his story , or because of the photographs themselves ? ”
6081	6084	6073	6073	I	0	“ Both . ”
6088	6106	6085	6085	I	0	“ The photographs stand on their own — they’re both pretty and gritty at the same time . ”
6119	6150	6110	6111	Mr. Shaw	76	“ But I think knowing the artist ’s story adds something to them . He knows this city like most of us do n’t and I think you can tell . ”
6180	6212	6174	6174	he	69	“ As I said , these are kinda passion projects for me . They ’re not necessarily meant for people to buy . The rest of the gallery is more contemporary . ”
6213	6220	6221	6221	he	69	“ They ’re not for sale ? ”
6230	6237	6221	6221	he	69	“ Well , yes they are . ”
6269	6282	6283	6283	He	69	“ I guess it ’s not the main focus of the gallery . ”
6343	6357	6358	6358	he	69	“ You do n’t like the rest of the work in the gallery ? ”
6366	6373	6358	6358	he	69	“ Just this little section here ? ”
6374	6400	6427	6427	he	69	“ Of course I like all the things in the gallery . Steve ’s very talented and the pieces back here are all very collectable . ”
6410	6419	6420	6420	His	69	“ But you ’re not passionate about them . ”
6447	6453	6444	6444	his	69	“ It ’s not that . ”
6466	6487	6458	6458	He	69	“ I just need to wear a business hat . Everything ca n’t be about what I ’m passionate about . ”
6664	6682	6683	6683	I	0	“ Do I have my skirt tucked in my panties or spinach in my teeth or something ? ”
6698	6705	6706	6706	Harper	68	“ No , you look perfect , ”
6709	6712	6713	6713	Scarlett	70	“ Beautiful , ”
6716	6719	6713	6713	Scarlett	70	“ Why ? ”
6725	6742	6720	6720	I	0	“ Just , that guy over there is staring and I ca n’t work out why . ”
6755	6759	6760	6760	she	70	“ That one ? ”
6763	6781	6760	6760	she	70	“ The really tall , hot one who wears a suit almost as well as my man ? ”
6782	6789	6790	6790	I	0	“ He ’s not that hot , ”
6806	6821	6793	6793	He	76	“ He ’s extraordinarily hot and it looks like he ’s hot for you . ”
6822	6827	6828	6828	I	0	“ He looks angry , ”
6831	6840	6828	6828	I	0	“ And anyway , definitely not my type . ”
6856	6862	6863	6863	Harper	68	“ That ’s for sure , ”
6866	6893	6863	6863	Harper	68	“ He looks like he pays his own rent and goes to the barber regularly . You would n’t want any of that , would you ? ”
6934	6938	6939	6939	I	0	“ Different strokes , ”
7291	7295	7296	7297	a woman	1849	“ Good afternoon , ”
7374	7378	7379	7379	I	0	“ Ms. Astor , ”
7396	7404	7388	7388	She	75	“ Mr. Shaw , is n’t it ? ”
7414	7417	7418	7418	I	0	“ Indeed . ”
7471	7478	7479	7479	she	75	“ How can I help you ? ”
7497	7505	7506	7506	I	0	“ I came to have another look , ”
7515	7520	7506	7506	I	0	“ Do you mind ? ”
7521	7526	7527	7527	she	75	“ Not at all , ”
7536	7543	7544	7544	I	0	“ Did the exhibition do well ? ”
7581	7600	7601	7601	I	0	“ Yes , almost everything sold that night or in the following days once the reviews were published . ”
7627	7642	7618	7618	her	75	“ I have four pieces left if you ’d like me to show you ? ”
7643	7652	7671	7671	she	75	“ Like I said , not my thing . ”
7662	7670	7671	7671	she	75	“ You like your art more classic , ”
7695	7710	7687	7687	I	0	“ Honestly , I do n’t know . I ’m new to all this . ”
7793	7798	7799	7799	Grace	74	“ New to what ? ”
7802	7805	7806	7806	I	0	“ Art , ”
7809	7818	7806	7806	I	0	“ I ’m not sure what I like . ”
7819	7825	7826	7826	She	74	“ But you like these ? ”
7841	7845	7838	7838	I	0	“ I guess . ”
8027	8037	8038	8038	Grace	74	“ It ’s a bit of an eclectic collection , ”
8057	8065	8038	8038	Grace	74	“ Yes , but I like that . ”
8082	8090	8091	8091	Grace	74	“ They ’re for sale , right ? ”
8105	8113	8100	8100	her	74	“ Yep , they ’re for sale . ”
8157	8204	8146	8146	I	0	“ Well , like I said at the opening , they do n’t really go together . The photographs are the most modern of the selection . The photographer has had some attention recently , but he ’s not got a huge following at the moment . ”
8205	8215	8250	8250	she	74	“ Tell me a little more about his pieces ? ”
8229	8236	8237	8237	I	0	“ Well , they ’re beautiful . ”
8261	8264	8265	8265	I	0	“ And ? ”
8321	8355	8314	8314	She	74	“ I like that he still looks for the beauty , despite having seen such darkness . And I think you can see the tragedy in them but also . . . hope . ”
8379	8387	8388	8388	She	74	“ And with these nudes . . . ”
8399	8435	8388	8388	She	74	“ At first glance , they ’re almost carelessly put on the page , but if you look closer , and you notice the turn of her head , the artist is fascinated by her . ”
8441	8453	8454	8454	I	0	“ But I do n’t know if they ’re any good , ”
8518	8529	8513	8513	She	74	“ If you like them , why does it matter ? ”
8536	8546	8530	8530	I	0	“ Because I do n’t want to lose money . ”
8547	8551	8552	8552	she	74	“ Of course , ”
8561	8573	8552	8552	she	74	“ Well you wo n’t . Not on any of these . ”
8574	8580	8581	8581	I	0	“ I ’ll take them , ”
8587	8590	8591	8591	she	74	“ Which ? ”
8631	8636	8626	8626	I	0	“ All of them . ”
8637	8642	8643	8643	she	74	“ All of them ? ”
8648	8653	8643	8643	she	74	“ Are you sure ? ”
8676	8682	8691	8691	she	74	“ Is that a problem ? ”
8694	8714	8691	8691	she	74	“ No , not at all . I just thought you ’d come to see the Steve Todd exhibition . ”
8715	8722	8723	8723	I	0	“ That was Nina ’s idea , ”
8730	8735	8723	8723	I	0	“ Not my thing . ”
8745	8769	8738	8738	I	0	“ Seemed like a big gamble to spend money on something I did n’t understand and felt no desire to know more about . ”
8814	8822	8823	8823	she	74	“ So , you want these instead ? ”
9050	9064	9044	9045	Grace Astor	74	“ Okay , well if I can just ask you to follow me . ”

10858	10881	10882	10882	He	76	“ Do n’t be . She told me what I wanted to hear . I prefer people who tell me the truth . ”
10898	10905	10888	10888	he	76	“ She ’s very sought after . ”

11411	11418	11419	11419	I	0	“ But you like these pieces , ”
11436	11463	11419	11419	I	0	“ Art does n’t have to be about what critics say is good . You can just have an emotional reaction rather than an intellectual one . ”
11464	11469	11470	11470	he	76	“ Passion over logic ? ”
11480	11493	11470	11470	he	76	“ Is such a concept so alien to you , Mr. Shaw ? ”

11651	11659	11631	11631	He	76	“ It can be either or both . ”
11660	11664	11665	11665	He	76	“ And this ? ”
11678	11681	11682	11682	I	0	“ Both , ”

11884	11915	11878	11878	He	76	“ I ’m not sure about that . Like I said , I ’m new at this art stuff . I really want to make sure I make good investments . ”

12001	12007	11990	11990	I	0	“ is a good investment . ”
12026	12039	12015	12015	his	463	“ You ’re right . I ’m not following my own logic . ”
12106	12120	12103	12103	he	463	“ I ’d like you to be my advisor . To replace Nina . ”
12133	12138	12103	12103	he	463	“ I ca n’t , ”
12237	12250	12251	12251	I	0	“ I think the nudes would be good in your dressing room , ”
12274	12285	12286	12286	he	463	“ Wo n’t that make me look like a pervert ? ”
12297	12320	12289	12289	I	0	“ I had n’t thought of that . Well , can you show me around or are we hanging everything in here ? ”
12341	12347	12369	12369	he	463	“ That ’s a study . ”
12374	12382	12369	12369	he	463	“ This is the second guest bedroom . ”
12676	12682	12683	12683	I	0	“ And your dressing room ? ”
12686	12690	12691	12691	He	76	“ Through there . ”

12754	12761	12740	12740	I	0	“ Sure , whatever you think . ”
12762	12775	12776	12776	I	0	“ Do you have any idea where you ’ll put the furniture ? ”
12812	12818	12801	12801	he	76	“ No . Not yet . ”
12852	12868	12844	12844	I	0	“ And the La Touche , I think that should be in the dining room . ”

13120	13143	13144	13144	he	76	“ What would she be saying to someone who she wanted to be her lover ? Is she trying to seduce him ? ”
13215	13234	13235	13235	I	0	“ Whoever the painter is , he ’s trying to figure it out as much as we are , ”
13238	13249	13250	13250	he	76	“ I think you like trying to figure people out , ”

13841	13884	13837	13837	he	76	“ You ’re trying to work out who I am , and why this apartment is empty . Why there ’s a beat - up old couch and a mattress on the floor , yet the closet is full of custom suits . ”
13911	13931	13932	13932	He	76	“ Oh yes , and you ’re attracted to me , but for some reason you ’re fighting it . ”

26492	26503	26504	26504	I	0	“ Because I need him to still be my client . ”
26576	26582	26583	26583	she	70	“ Was it bad sex ? ”
26586	26602	26583	26583	she	70	“ You ca n’t look at him because he had a two - inch penis ? ”

26714	26728	26729	26729	Scarlett	70	“ Take it down a notch . You just ordered a bread basket , ”
26732	26745	26729	26729	Scarlett	70	“ And we were talking about guys with two - inch dicks . ”

27005	27032	26987	26987	she	68	“ No , it ’s not a thing and it ’s never going to be . It just happened , but it wo n’t happen again . ”
27046	27073	27074	27074	I	0	“ I need to focus on the gallery at the moment . I think I ’m going to offer art consulting to people who want it . ”
27084	27095	27096	27096	Scarlett	70	“ Oh , I thought you were n’t into that , ”
27102	27122	27099	27099	I	0	“ But with Steve ’s work gone , I have to do whatever it takes to make it work . ”

27875	27894	27872	27872	she	70	“ Last night . He took me to dinner and said he ’d suspended his online dating account . ”

28084	28128	28081	28081	Harper	68	“ I met him last week and he ’s just divorced his wife . He ’s rich and I know you hate that , but I swear I ’m not making this up , he works at a homeless shelter twice a month . ”
28132	28151	28081	28081	Harper	68	“ He ’s either not as rich as you ’re saying , or he ’s lying to you . ”
28152	28159	28160	28160	Harper	68	“ Do n’t be so cynical . ”
28176	28184	28168	28171	the Queen of England	722	“ You should give him a chance . ”
28185	28194	28222	28222	she	68	“ I ’m not ready for . . . ”
28209	28221	28222	28222	she	68	“ You were ready for casual sex with a new client , ”
28256	28261	28253	28253	she	68	“ That was different . ”
28270	28273	28274	28274	Scarlett	70	“ Different ? ”
28277	28285	28274	28274	Scarlett	70	“ Yeah , like exercise or something . ”
28494	28501	28502	28502	I	0	“ Grace Astor for Sam Shaw , ”
28538	28546	28547	28547	she	727	“ Please follow me , Ms. Astor , ”

28704	28712	28713	28713	Sam	66	“ Grace Astor , you ’re late , ”
28716	28729	28730	28730	He	66	“ Deepest apologies for my tardiness . It could n’t be helped . ”
28749	28763	28746	28746	he	66	“ We ’ll eat here if you do n’t mind . Saves time . ”
28851	28859	28860	28860	I	0	“ So , this is the catalog , ”
28879	28904	28860	28860	I	0	“ I ’ve marked the ones I think are probably going to go for less than their real value with a Post - it . ”
28994	29026	29027	29027	He	66	“ Is there anything you like ? I mean , if you want to discuss my reasoning behind any of the pieces I ’ve marked , then do ask me questions . ”
29060	29068	29069	29069	he	66	“ What do the different colors mean ? ”
29082	29088	29089	29089	he	66	“ Your Post - its , ”
29092	29106	29089	29089	he	66	“ Just ignore them , they do n’t really matter for your purposes . ”
29107	29118	29119	29119	He	66	“ But there is a reason they ’re different colors . ”
29137	29143	29144	29144	I	0	“ Not a business reason , ”
29152	29165	29144	29144	I	0	“ I think you like the ones you marked green the best . ”
29178	29189	29190	29190	I	0	“ Why are you always trying to figure people out ? ”
29193	29197	29198	29198	he	66	“ Not always , ”
29207	29223	29198	29198	he	66	“ Only people who I want something from , or who want something from me . ”
29224	29233	29234	29234	He	66	“ And which box do I fit into ? ”
29243	29255	29234	29234	He	66	“ I think you have a box all of your own . ”
29333	29356	29357	29357	he	66	“ I agree , by the way . I like the green ones , too . But I want to see them , ”
29380	29389	29364	29364	he	66	“ You want to see the green ones ? ”
29390	29393	29394	29394	he	66	“ Yes , ”
29397	29429	29394	29394	he	66	“ You should keep an open mind about some of the others . There may be some other good buys among those that I ’ve marked in something other than green . ”
29430	29447	29364	29364	he	66	“ I ’m good with the green . I think we should go with your gut . ”
29448	29466	29370	29370	he	66	“ And you ’re not going to tell me how you knew the greens were my favorite ? ”
29467	29489	29490	29490	He	66	“ It ’s no secret . I ’m getting to know you . The way you like the intimate or unexpected . ”
29493	29498	29490	29490	He	66	“ In your art . ”
29508	29534	29499	29499	He	66	“ And you clearly had n’t marked them on price or period . It ’s cute . Do n’t be self - conscious about it . ”
29535	29552	29557	29557	him	66	“ I ’m not . If I was I would have replaced the Post - its . ”
29567	29590	29560	29560	he	66	“ Anyway , it ’s too late to see the paintings before the auction next week — the viewing closes this afternoon . ”
29591	29599	29557	29557	him	66	“ Then we ’ll go after lunch . ”

29681	29706	29676	29676	he	66	“ Okay , I can take you this afternoon . . . on one condition . If you get more then I get more . ”
29768	29772	29754	29754	He	66	“ Name it . ”
29773	29786	29787	29787	He	66	“ After the showing , we go and buy you a couch . ”
29790	29798	29787	29787	He	66	“ That ’s the more you want ? ”
29816	29819	29813	29813	I	0	“ Deal . ”
29947	29970	29971	29971	she	749	“ Look at his boot – it seems black , but if you look closer , the paint is green and white , ”
30045	30058	30059	30059	I	0	“ You ’re even more beautiful like this — passionate , excited , ”
30196	30205	30206	30206	she	749	“ Do you know which you like best ? ”
30209	30227	30206	30206	she	749	“ We should narrow it down to two or three and then place limits on them all . ”
30244	30256	30233	30233	she	749	“ You should prepare yourself for not getting anything at all . ”
30289	30295	30296	30296	I	0	“ I like these two , ”
30330	30333	30334	30334	she	749	“ Yes ! ”

30390	30413	30414	30414	I	0	“ I think if we can get them for the right price , it would be a good buy . What else ? ”
30459	30472	30473	30473	I	0	“ The Brueghel . God , yes . It ’s so you . ”
30484	30489	30490	30490	I	0	“ It ’s me ? ”
30521	30540	30518	30518	she	67	“ Yeah . You know . Dark and stern . But then you get closer and . . . ”

30654	30664	30665	30665	she	67	“ How come you do n’t have a driver ? ”
30668	30679	30680	30680	She	67	“ You ’re like richer than the pope or something . ”
30699	30713	30686	30686	I	0	“ Why should I have a driver ? Manhattan ’s full of them . ”
30737	30750	30751	30751	she	67	“ Well , you could fire a driver if he did that , ”
30754	30767	30751	30751	she	67	“ But I ’m glad it was n’t me . Thank you . ”
30857	30871	30872	30872	she	67	“ But you do n’t want to spend your money on someone permanent ? ”
30875	30887	30872	30872	she	67	“ No , I just do n’t think it ’s necessary . ”
30888	30918	30919	30919	She	67	“ You say that like you do n’t buy into the New York lifestyle , but look at your office , or your suits , for Christ ’s sake . ”
30944	30973	30974	30974	Grace	66	“ That ’s different . That ’s business . People expect me to have nice offices , wear nice suits . It ’s just part of the job . ”
30977	30989	30974	30974	Grace	66	“ So you ’re just doing what everyone expects of you ? ”
31041	31064	31032	31032	she	67	“ I ’m doing what ’s necessary . Sometimes you have to take certain steps in order to get to your goal . ”
31110	31118	31119	31119	Grace	66	“ So you do whatever it takes ? ”
31128	31165	31166	31166	I	0	“ No . That ’s not what I said . I do things to help me achieve my goal . But that ’s just common sense . There ’s no point making life harder for yourself , ”
31189	31222	31181	31181	She	772	“ You were dating the artist of your first exhibition . You would n’t have got his show if you had n’t been involved , right ? You did what it took . ”
31223	31226	31227	31227	She	772	“ What ? ”
31235	31254	31227	31227	She	772	“ He was using me , you asshole . Steve would n’t have gotten an exhibition without me . ”
31255	31270	31181	31181	She	772	“ That ’s not what I was trying to say . Do n’t overreact . ”
31271	31289	31290	31290	She	772	“ Did you know I found him banging his assistant on my desk just after I opened ? ”
31323	31334	31314	31314	I	0	“ And how did you know I was dating him ? ”
31335	31364	31365	31365	I	0	“ It was obvious . And just because he cheated on you does n’t mean you did n’t do what you had to do to further your goals , ”
31371	31374	31375	31375	she	772	“ Whatever , ”
31405	31412	31413	31413	she	772	“ So am I using you ? ”
31435	31447	31448	31448	I	0	“ I did n’t say you were using that painter guy . ”
31485	31493	31494	31494	she	772	“ You did n’t answer my question . ”
31497	31511	31494	31494	she	772	“ When we had sex , what exactly was I using you for ? ”
31512	31519	31520	31520	She	772	“ Let me ask you something . ”
31525	31543	31544	31544	I	0	“ I ’m not asking to be evasive , I just want to answer your question better , ”
31571	31576	31577	31577	she	772	“ Go on then , ”
31580	31589	31577	31577	she	772	“ Who was your boyfriend before the cheater ? ”
31612	31620	31592	31592	her	772	“ His name was Nathan . Happy ? ”
31621	31635	31592	31592	her	772	“ But what did he do ? What did you like about him ? ”
31636	31647	31648	31648	She	772	“ He was a musician , if you must know . ”
31666	31672	31673	31673	She	772	“ He was very talented . ”
31686	31692	31693	31693	I	0	“ I like this one , ”
31750	31757	31758	31758	I	0	“ Using is the wrong word , ”
31761	31779	31758	31758	I	0	“ But you have to get something out of a situation , otherwise why would you bother ? ”
31813	31846	31848	31848	she	772	“ You have a type of guy you normally date . That ’s because you get something out of dating that guy — just like he gets something out of dating you . ”
31866	31869	31870	31870	she	772	“ Okay , ”
31873	31882	31870	31870	she	772	“ And I had sex with you because ? ”
31883	31888	31889	31889	I	0	“ My big cock ? ”
31912	31917	31918	31918	I	0	“ You like it ? ”
31925	31939	31918	31918	I	0	“ I do . It ’s masculine and pretty at the same time . ”
31940	31957	31908	31908	her	772	“ Okay , well if this is the one , let ’s find a sales clerk . ”
31958	31965	31966	31966	I	0	“ What , just like that ? ”
31992	32009	31985	31985	she	772	“ We ’ve found something we like . What ’s the point in continuing to look ? ”
32010	32043	32044	32044	I	0	“ You ’ve resisted buying furniture for what looks like your whole life , but now , all of a sudden , you ’re ready to pick the first thing we see ? ”
32056	32088	32044	32044	I	0	“ I told you I ’d get a couch . We found one . I like it . I ’m going to buy it . It ’s really not that complicated . ”
32098	32112	32113	32113	I	0	“ Okay . Well that was easy . What about a coffee table ? ”
32128	32133	32134	32134	I	0	“ Oh of course , ”
32160	32163	32164	32164	she	772	“ What ? ”
32183	32189	32164	32164	she	772	“ You ’re a fixer . ”
32226	32237	32238	32238	she	772	“ And you ’re a know - it - all , ”
32241	32248	32238	32238	she	772	“ Do you like this table ? ”
32263	32301	32252	32252	she	772	“ I ’m not going to make it that easy for you , Grace Astor . If you want to push at my boundaries , I get to peer over your Park Avenue princess walls , too . ”
32316	32329	32330	32330	she	772	“ Excuse me , Mr. Shaw would like to take this couch , ”

32391	32397	32398	32398	she	363	“ What are you doing ? ”
32411	32419	32420	32420	I	0	“ I ’m peering over your walls , ”
32423	32458	32420	32420	I	0	“ I bet you ’ve never , ever kissed someone in public . If you want me to buy that table , press your lips against mine in front of everyone in this store . ”
32463	32469	32470	32470	she	363	“ You ’re blackmailing me ? ”
32473	32486	32470	32470	she	363	“ Hardly . We ’re talking about a kiss and a table . ”
32558	32561	32562	32562	she	363	“ Okay , ”
32627	32630	32631	32631	I	0	“ More , ”
32833	32838	32839	32839	she	363	“ Your . . . ”
32863	32870	32853	32853	She	363	“ It makes my face red . ”
32958	32968	32969	32971	the sales clerk	792	“ You want normal shipping or the expedited option ? ”
32989	32992	32969	32971	the sales clerk	792	“ Expedited , ”
33011	33022	33023	33023	she	363	“ Right , now a dining table and a bed , ”
33034	33043	33044	33044	I	0	“ You know how this works , right ? ”
33047	33052	33053	33053	she	363	“ How what works ? ”
33063	33104	33105	33105	She	363	“ You get to push , I get to push . If that kiss was what I get for a coffee table , I ’ll have to think up something suitable before you pick out stuff for the dining room . ”
33117	33131	33132	33132	she	363	“ Well , let ’s just look on the way to the exit , ”
33192	33202	33203	33203	She	363	“ Nope . There ’s nothing here for you . ”
33213	33218	33219	33219	I	0	“ Scaredy - cat , ”
33227	33249	33222	33222	She	363	“ I ’m not scared ; I just do n’t like these dining tables . It ’s as simple as that . ”
33260	33281	33282	33282	She	363	“ I thought you had a little more grit , Grace Astor . You ’ve fallen at the first hurdle . ”
33292	33310	33311	33311	she	363	“ Is this how you get women ? You blackmail them into a physical relationship with you ? ”
33323	33326	33327	33327	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
33330	33335	33327	33327	I	0	“ All the time . ”
33359	33368	33356	33356	she	363	“ What would you have made me do ? ”
33369	33378	33356	33356	she	363	“ I would n’t make you do anything . ”
33379	33391	33395	33395	she	363	“ Okay then , what would have been the pay off ? ”
33445	33449	33442	33442	I	0	“ A tattoo . ”
33519	33530	33485	33485	she	363	“ Jesus , no way . That would be permanent . ”
33531	33537	33538	33538	I	0	“ Where are you going ? ”
33541	33544	33545	33545	she	363	“ Brooklyn , ”
33548	33556	33557	33557	I	0	“ And you ’re getting a cab ? ”
33560	33573	33557	33557	I	0	“ No , you ’re not a Park Avenue princess at all . ”
33619	33636	33637	33637	I	0	“ Christ , I ’m sorry , Angie , I do n’t know what to say . ”
33683	33696	33697	33697	she	67	“ Fucking hell , Sam , do n’t get emotional on me , ”
33706	33717	33697	33697	she	67	“ Since when are you allowed to hold my hand ? ”
33780	33798	33770	33770	I	0	“ Fuck off , I ’m not getting emotional . I just want you to be happy . ”
33817	33836	33770	33770	I	0	“ I did n’t tell you I have cancer — just that Chas has a low sperm count . ”
33837	33844	33845	33845	I	0	“ But can that be fixed ? ”
33869	33897	33858	33858	Angie	67	“ Doctors said we need to keep trying , and if it still has n’t happened in six months , we might have to think about IVF . ”
33898	33909	33860	33860	her	67	“ That sounds . . . like a big step . ”
33910	33942	33943	33943	Angie	67	“ It is . And I ’m not sure I ’d do it . I mean , I hate needles and it just seems a bit against nature , you know ? ”
33954	33963	33964	33964	I	0	“ Will Chas ’s health plan cover IVF ? ”
34025	34057	34058	34058	I	0	“ You know we ’re going to have to have a conversation about this , so just give into it now , rather than after three months of arguments about it , ”
34061	34073	34074	34074	she	67	“ What are you talking about , you crazy - man ? ”
34088	34112	34074	34074	she	67	“ You know what I ’m talking about . You hate discussing money , but I ’m going to pay for the IVF . ”
34172	34191	34167	34167	I	0	“ Fuck off . Chas would never go for it . You ’re not paying for our baby . ”
34192	34225	34226	34226	I	0	“ Of course I ’m not paying for your baby . I ’m not a human trafficker , for Christ ’s sake . I just want to pick up the medical expenses . ”
34243	34277	34229	34229	Angie	67	“ Maybe it ’s just not meant to be . God only knows what kind of mother I ’d be . I sure as hell did n’t have much of a role model . ”
34278	34294	34295	34295	She	67	“ You ’re not going to be your mother , Angie . You know that . ”
34298	34328	34295	34295	She	67	“ Who ’s to say ? They say we turn into our parents . And if that ’s true , any baby I have does n’t stand a chance . ”
34340	34383	34329	34329	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare let your mother steal this part of your life from you . You ’re not her . Look at the way you are with Chas — was she ever a loving wife in the way you are ? ”
34400	34418	34419	34419	She	67	“ You ca n’t let her rob you of your future — she ’s done enough damage . ”
34428	34441	34425	34425	her	67	“ Thank you , Sam . You always know what to say . ”
34445	34474	34442	34442	I	0	“ And I ’m paying for the IVF . I do n’t want to hear about it again . In return , I ’ll buy a new couch . ”
34483	34491	34479	34479	her	67	“ Did you buy a couch already ? ”
34499	34514	34492	34492	Busted	101	“ I will if you say yes to letting me cover your medical expenses . ”
34515	34524	34525	34525	she	67	“ I think you already bought a couch , ”
34528	34534	34525	34525	she	67	“ What brought that on ? ”
34535	34543	34492	34492	Busted	101	“ Angie , listen , I want — ”
34544	34554	34525	34525	she	67	“ I ’ll talk to Chas . No promises . ”
34591	34594	34595	34595	I	0	“ Okay , ”
34598	34607	34595	34595	I	0	“ Okay . Tell me about the couch . ”
34624	34636	34608	34608	I	0	“ What is there to say ? I bought a couch . ”
34637	34642	34672	34672	her	67	“ Just like that ? ”
34643	34646	34647	34647	I	0	“ Sure , ”
34662	34665	34650	34650	Angie	67	“ Where ? ”
34666	34669	34670	34670	She	67	“ Saks . ”
34678	34695	34672	34672	her	67	“ Riiight . You just happened to decide to go to Saks and buy a couch . ”
34699	34713	34672	34672	her	67	“ Okay , if you must know , my art consultant took me . ”
34714	34718	34650	34650	Angie	67	“ A woman ? ”
34719	34735	34672	34672	her	67	“ Yes , a woman . We were looking at some paintings and . . . ”
34746	34760	34738	34738	I	0	“ I asked her where to shop and one thing led to another . ”
34785	34791	34779	34779	Angie	67	“ She offered to help . ”
34792	34802	34803	34803	Angie	67	“ Offered to suck your dick , more like , ”
34854	34873	34874	34874	I	0	“ You ca n’t assume that everyone who ’s polite and helpful wants to get in my pants , ”
34877	34881	34882	34882	She	67	“ Why not ? ”
34885	34900	34882	34882	She	67	“ They probably do . Who is this chick anyway ? Is she hot ? ”
34901	34908	34938	34938	she	67	“ She ’s my art consultant . ”
34909	34926	34927	34927	I	0	“ And couch consultant , apparently . It sounds like she ’s consulting you very well . ”
34934	34937	34938	34938	she	67	“ Well , ”
34942	34973	34938	34938	she	67	“ I think it ’s good . You need a little ‘ consulting ’ in your life . I like the idea of you picking out furniture with a woman . ”
34983	34997	34938	34938	she	67	“ We ’re not setting up house together , for Christ ’s sake . ”
34998	35016	35017	35017	She	67	“ No , you ’re just picking out furniture together . You ’ve got nothing to hide . ”
35022	35030	35017	35017	She	67	“ Like I said , I approve . ”
35071	35084	35085	35085	I	0	“ And you ’re going to speak to Chas about the IVF ? ”
35091	35105	35088	35088	She	67	“ Better we talk about my womb that your love life , right ? ”
35106	35115	35116	35116	Her	67	“ There is no love life , Angie . ”
35120	35126	35116	35116	Her	67	“ Maybe there should be . ”
35430	35433	35434	35434	Sam	66	“ Hey , ”
35456	35460	35461	35461	he	66	“ You okay ? ”
35485	35496	35473	35473	I	0	“ Yeah , fine . Just thinking while I waited . ”
35497	35504	35505	35505	he	66	“ Sorry to keep you waiting , ”
35613	35618	35619	35619	I	0	“ I like thinking , ”
35626	35633	35634	35634	he	66	“ What were you thinking about ? ”
35645	35649	35650	35650	I	0	“ Just things , ”

35701	35715	35697	35697	His	66	“ You ’ve been thinking about whether or not I have a tattoo ? ”
35742	35745	35746	35746	I	0	“ Here , ”
35793	35808	35809	35809	I	0	“ So , we have to stick to our maximum bid on these pieces , ”
35844	35854	35829	35829	collectors	829	“ We do n’t want to get carried away . ”
35855	35867	35868	35868	he	66	“ Yes , we would n’t want that . Would we ? ”
35872	35900	35868	35868	he	66	“ I ’m serious , Sam . The adrenaline will start to flow and a man like you is bound to feel tempted to outbid other people . ”
35901	35907	35908	35908	he	66	“ A man like me ? ”
35911	35917	35908	35908	he	66	“ A guy with tattoos ? ”
35918	35925	35926	35926	He	66	“ Yes . I mean no . ”
35938	35954	35926	35926	He	66	“ You do n’t get to be as successful as you are without being competitive . ”
36001	36011	36012	36012	I	0	“ So did you say you had a tattoo ? ”
36050	36054	36055	36055	he	66	“ Just one , ”
36058	36073	36055	36055	he	66	“ I would n’t ask you to do something I had n’t done myself . ”
36120	36124	36125	36125	he	66	“ You okay ? ”
36139	36144	36145	36145	I	0	“ What is it ? ”

36313	36316	36317	36317	he	66	“ Look , ”
36324	36333	36317	36317	he	66	“ He has a little hammer and everything . ”
36383	36389	36390	36390	Sam	66	“ I like the colors , ”
36437	36444	36445	36445	I	0	“ Do you want to bid ? ”
36453	36462	36448	36448	He	66	“ That ’s why I ’m paying you . ”

36866	36872	36873	36873	Sam	66	“ It does n’t matter , ”
36876	36884	36873	36873	Sam	66	“ Honestly . This is an experience . ”
37094	37116	37086	37086	Sam	66	“ It ’ll be fine . Whatever happens it wo n’t be the best or the worst day of my life . ”

40038	40042	40043	40043	he	66	“ Lie back , ”
40046	40059	40043	40043	he	66	“ I want to see that blonde hair spread across the cushions . ”
40098	40105	40106	40106	he	66	“ Even your pussy is beautiful , ”
40124	40130	40106	40106	he	66	“ Your mouth . . . ”

41533	41569	41570	41570	She	74	“ I think this will be his second exhibition out of art school . There was a really traditional feel to his last show , so I ’m hoping you ’re going to like it . ”

41603	41612	41613	41613	she	74	“ You do n’t have to come along , ”
41616	41684	41613	41613	she	74	“ I could go on my own , do a bit of research , take a few photos on my phone and then report back . I do n’t know too much about the work , to be honest . I have to see it — it could be a disaster . I do n’t want to waste your time . I know how busy you are . ”

41863	41876	41860	41860	I	0	“ We can research together . Now , what about dining tables ? ”

41945	41955	41956	41956	She	74	“ Pretty was n’t what you were going for ? ”
41961	41972	41956	41956	She	74	“ If you like it , I ’ll take it , ”
41980	42012	42013	42013	Her	74	“ There ’s a place in the East Village that is supposed to be good , but you ’ll have to come with me . I ’m not doing it alone . ”
42069	42077	42078	42078	she	74	“ It would have to be small , ”
42081	42097	42078	42078	she	74	“ And I like the idea of words . No Mickey Mouse head or anything . ”
42174	42199	42200	42200	She	74	“ What about this afternoon ? I ’m sure you ’re busy around here , but I might lose my nerve if I wait . ”
42210	42213	42214	42214	she	74	“ So ? ”
42217	42222	42214	42214	she	74	“ Are you busy ? ”

42282	42302	42279	42279	I	0	“ I mean , it was a big ask — too much . I never thought you ’d actually — ”
42303	42313	42314	42314	she	74	“ You need a dining table , Sam Shaw , ”
42317	42339	42314	42314	she	74	“ I ’ll buy one , but you do n’t need to get a tattoo . It was a stupid idea . ”
42361	42368	42369	42369	she	74	“ A deal is a deal , ”
42380	42396	42369	42369	she	74	“ And it seems the risks I ’m taking in my life are paying off . ”
42404	42410	42397	42397	She	74	“ So why stop now ? ”
42432	42441	42442	42446	the guy behind the counter	922	“ Any idea of what you ’d like ? ”
42520	42524	42525	42525	she	74	“ Your choice , ”
42540	42560	42561	42561	I	0	“ No way . I ’m not choosing your tattoo . You have to live with it . . . ”

42643	42655	42656	42656	She	74	“ This is too permanent , Grace . We should go . ”
42668	42684	42656	42656	She	74	“ I do n’t do things I do n’t want to . Please , Sam . ”
42698	42702	42691	42691	her	74	“ Choose something . ”
42765	42793	42794	42794	She	74	“ Come on . We have n’t got all day . We ’ve got dining furniture to shop for . Pick what you think would look good . ”
42849	42865	42841	42841	I	0	“ Okay , lie down , Princess , and I ’ll come up with something . ”
43000	43009	43010	43010	I	0	“ You want yours where I have mine ? ”
43048	43058	43059	43059	I	0	“ Are you sure you want to do this ? ”

43138	43155	43158	43158	her	74	“ What happens if I ’ve asked him to tattoo a gigantic turd on your ribcage ? ”
43168	43173	43162	43162	she	74	“ I trust you . ”
43199	43204	43205	43205	I	0	“ Are you ready ? ”
43259	43263	43249	43249	I	0	“ Squeeze tight . ”

43602	43615	43599	43599	she	74	“ That ’s lovely , Sam . Where does it come from ? ”
43616	43622	43627	43627	he	1858	“ You ’re all done , ”
43643	43652	43653	43653	She	74	“ No , Sam . I ’ll pay . ”

43748	43759	43745	43745	she	74	“ What does it mean ? You did n’t say . ”
43793	43800	43772	43772	I	0	“ It ’s from a book . ”
43801	43808	43809	43809	she	74	“ You ’re quite the reader , ”
43812	43825	43826	43826	she	74	“ Is it the same book that you got your quote from ? ”
43832	43860	43829	43829	I	0	“ It is , actually . From the same passage , even . You said you wanted me to choose and for it to be like mine . ”

44267	44325	44264	44264	I	0	“ Actually , it ’s kinda great . The redness is gone . From a distance , you ca n’t see it at all , but then as you look closer , it almost seems to reveal itself in layers . First you see it ’s writing , then you read it , then you understand it . ”
44343	44350	44351	44351	she	74	“ You know what I mean ? ”
44397	44411	44412	44412	she	74	“ I ’m reading your book . I hope you do n’t mind , ”

44542	44550	44551	44551	she	74	“ I ’ve never read it before , ”
44554	44586	44587	44587	She	74	“ I kind of knew of the story — the young man , falsely imprisoned for a crime he did n’t commit — that he fights to survive , to escape . ”
44592	44603	44587	44587	She	74	“ Reading it , I understand why you like it . ”

44788	44822	44785	44785	I	0	“ Yeah . Buyers will be put off , though . Someone lost control of the guest list , but that could be good for us . Plenty of pieces without red dots . ”
44823	44832	44765	44765	I	0	“ Is n’t more people good for sales ? ”
44833	44850	44858	44858	She	965	“ Only if they ’re here to buy rather than take advantage of the free bar . ”
44851	44857	44858	44858	She	965	“ What do you think ? ”
44869	44877	44858	44858	She	965	“ Just give me your gut instinct . ”
44944	44949	44950	44950	I	0	“ You like them ? ”
45002	45010	45011	45011	she	965	“ Let ’s take a closer look , ”
45112	45119	45120	45120	she	965	“ I do n’t feel it , ”
45130	45145	45120	45120	she	965	“ I think maybe I should , but I do n’t . Do you ? ”
45154	45161	45162	45162	I	0	“ I do n’t think so , ”
45166	45180	45181	45181	she	965	“ You know when you saw the Lautrec ? How did that feel ? ”
45190	45215	45216	45216	She	965	“ I thought they were colorful and clean and . . . straightforward . They were n’t trying to be anything they were n’t . ”
45231	45234	45235	45235	she	965	“ No , ”
45246	45270	45235	45235	she	965	“ That ’s good . I ’m laughing because you ’re describing everything these paintings are n’t . And I agree with you . ”
45284	45314	45279	45279	her	965	“ But even if I did n’t agree with you , you ’re allowed to like art for whatever reason you like it . Do n’t ever feel judged . ”
45335	45349	45350	45350	she	965	“ But now we ’re here , let ’s try those over there , ”
45399	45408	45409	45409	she	965	“ Technically , the artist is quite talented , ”
45412	45429	45409	45409	she	965	“ But I ’m not sure that ’s enough if neither of us are feeling it . ”
45430	45436	45409	45409	she	965	“ But he ’s talented ? ”
45467	45486	45487	45487	She	965	“ Just the way he layers the color and uses the illusion of light . You see here . ”
45511	45535	45487	45487	She	965	“ It ’s promising — like a homage to Rothko and Turner . But it ’s too clinical — there ’s no passion . ”
45569	45576	45577	45577	I	0	“ So , we should go ? ”
45600	45605	45606	45606	she	965	“ I ’m sorry , ”
45616	45624	45625	45625	I	0	“ There ’s no reason to be . ”
45632	45643	45625	45625	I	0	“ I should have checked it out before bringing you . ”

45729	45745	45727	45727	her	965	“ We were there for twenty minutes . You probably left the office early and — ”
45746	45768	45769	45769	I	0	“ Grace , I was happy to come . In fact , I was thinking maybe I need some more furniture . ”
45815	45825	45826	45826	she	965	“ I think most places are closed this late , ”
45836	45858	45829	45829	I	0	“ Not today , but if I were to say you could buy anything you wanted for my place . . . ”
45879	45889	45859	45859	I	0	“ Would you come on a date with me ? ”
45890	45894	45895	45895	she	965	“ A date ? ”
45905	45908	45909	45909	I	0	“ Yes , ”
45912	45916	45909	45909	I	0	“ A date . ”

46088	46104	46116	46116	She	965	“ Well , I guess I ’m going to have to help you — shit . ”
46142	46151	46133	46133	she	965	“ I ca n’t believe they sold it . ”
46152	46157	46177	46177	her	965	“ What is it ? ”
46158	46167	46168	46168	she	965	“ My painting . They sold my painting , ”
46182	46192	46193	46193	I	0	“ This was one you had in your gallery ? ”
46208	46225	46226	46226	she	965	“ It ’s Renoir . Is n’t it the most beautiful thing you ’ve ever seen ? ”
46241	46247	46237	46237	I	0	“ Look at her face . ”
46278	46283	46284	46284	I	0	“ It ’s pretty , ”
46347	46355	46356	46356	I	0	“ You think I should buy it ? ”
46364	46372	46373	46373	She	965	“ Come on , let ’s go . ”
46381	46384	46385	46385	I	0	“ Grace , ”

46414	46445	46411	46411	She	965	“ It was mine . . . for a while . Now it ’s not . I did what I had to do , and now I need to leave . ”
46460	46463	46464	46464	I	0	“ Hey , ”
46471	46485	46464	46464	I	0	“ No . I ’m done talking . I want to go home . ”

47002	47019	46990	46990	he	66	“ If your feet get tired , I ’m sure I can give you a piggyback . ”
47131	47156	47157	47157	Sam	66	“ I ’m sure you ’ve been to this place a million times , but I wondered if you ’d share it with me ? ”
47225	47232	47233	47233	he	66	“ Those shoes are something else , ”
47250	47254	47255	47255	I	0	“ Something else ? ”

47396	47406	47407	47407	he	66	“ It ’s whatever we want it to be , ”
47410	47432	47407	47407	he	66	“ I thought maybe you could show me your favorite pieces and then we ’ll have dinner in the dining room . ”
47433	47438	47439	47439	He	66	“ The dining room ? ”
47457	47483	47451	47451	he	66	“ Yeah , they asked me which room , but since I had no idea what you ’d like I went with the obvious choice . ”

47520	47554	47513	47513	my	0	“ I could n’t tell you what ’s in the room , to be honest . Just that there are a lot of paintings in there . I thought you might like it . ”

47693	47720	47680	47680	I	0	“ They do n’t normally open on a Saturday night . I thought it would be nice to be here , just the two of us . ”
47806	47829	47830	47830	He	66	“ Is this what you do ? Extravagance , blow women away with your thoughtfulness in order to get into their panties ? ”
47838	47845	47830	47830	He	66	“ I ’ve blown you away ? ”
47892	47899	47903	47903	his	66	“ Yeah . A little bit . ”

47967	47998	47999	47999	I	0	“ I want you to be comfortable . If you wanted to slip the skirt off and walk around naked , that would be just fine with me , too . ”

48191	48217	48179	48179	He	66	“ Yes . Degas . This is very typical of him . Sam leaned forward to read the title of the picture on the plaque . “

48343	48351	48337	48337	I	0	” We wandered into the West Gallery . “
48360	48375	48352	48352	I	0	” I said as we stood in front of Turner ’s Harbor of Dieppe . “

48482	48508	48509	48510	Some people	1055	” His enjoyment seemed real and as much as I loved these paintings , seeing him love them gave me an additional level of pleasure . “
48527	48531	48532	48532	People	1826	” I said . “
48540	48551	48532	48532	People	1826	” The man who had served us champagne interrupted us . “

48567	48571	48564	48564	you	0	” Sam asked . “
48574	48601	48564	48564	you	0	” I said , though honestly , I was n’t . I felt full up with life , happiness . With the evening . With Sam . “
48609	48619	48564	48564	you	0	” I said as we entered the dining room . “
48638	48654	48621	48621	you	0	” Sam glanced around at the portraits of wealthy British land owners and their wives . “
48666	48692	48621	48621	you	0	” he asked , waiting for me to take a seat at the dining table set just for two in the middle of the room . “
48701	48705	48621	48621	you	0	” I laughed . “
48726	48727	48714	48714	I	0	” “
48736	48749	48730	48730	you	0	” he asked as two waiters filled our water and wine glasses . “
48791	48802	48787	48787	you	0	” Sam ’s smile disappeared and his face went blank . “
48805	48806	48787	48787	you	0	” “
48813	48840	48787	48787	you	0	” I asked . There was a beat of silence between us , as if he were thinking about an answer to an almost impossible question . “
48857	48906	48907	48907	God	100	” It was as if he ’d punched me in the stomach . A million words whooshed through my brain and then left before I could cling to any of them . I wanted to say the right thing so badly . In the end , I said , “
48914	48931	48909	48909	I	0	” and reached across the table . He moved his hand before I could touch him . “
48939	48951	48952	48952	You	0	” he said as he put his napkin in his lap . “
48960	49010	48952	48952	You	0	” he asked , changing the subject . I wanted him to know how sorry I was for his loss , to find a way to make it better . Despite his prickly exterior , Sam was a kind and generous man who deserved good things in his life . “
49018	49024	49011	49011	Sam	66	” He cleared his throat . “
49060	49070	49071	49071	You	66	” His words brought me back to our date . “
49090	49099	49100	49100	You	66	” Sam smiled , a big boyish grin . “
49105	49109	49100	49100	You	66	” I giggled . “

49123	49240	49110	49110	You	66	” Dinner arrived and we did n’t speak until we were alone again . We were content just to watch each other , our eyes joined as if we worried if either of us looked away , the other would disappear . I did n’t want to ruin tonight by pushing him to talk to me about his past . It seemed every encounter with him told me something more compelling , more heartbreaking , more loveable about him . I was n’t having dinner with another spoiled rich guy — Sam Shaw had known loss and overcome it . Nothing had been handed to him . I wanted to know every last thought in his head .
49277	49284	49285	49285	I	0	“ Let me get your door , ”

50536	50560	50561	50561	I	0	“ And I ’m going to come all over you . I ’m going to stain your beautiful skin so I own you . ”

53961	53976	53977	53978	my father	252	“ Come on , Sylvia . Let ’s leave Grace to get to work , ”
53981	54005	53977	53978	my father	252	“ We ’ll have a lovely time . It ’s the company that counts . Will we see you there , Mr. Shaw ? ”
54025	54036	54017	54017	I	0	“ Have a great time . I have to go . ”
54088	54099	54100	54100	he	66	“ Nice to meet you , Mr. and Mrs. Astor , ”
54117	54128	54129	54129	he	66	“ You did n’t tell me it was your birthday , ”
54145	54150	54151	54151	I	0	“ It ’s not , ”
54177	54189	54165	54165	He	66	“ Next week is , and you did n’t tell me . ”
54221	54241	54211	54211	him	66	“ It ’s just going to be a few friends and family . You can come if you like . ”
54242	54246	54247	54247	he	66	“ I like , ”
54254	54261	54247	54247	he	66	“ It will probably be boring . ”
54262	54268	54211	54211	him	66	“ I do n’t care . ”
54269	54277	54278	54278	I	0	“ Is this what we do now ? ”
54293	54300	54301	54301	He	66	“ Is what what we do ? ”
54320	54340	54309	54309	I	0	“ Invite each other to things . Introduce each other to our friends . Are we doing that stuff ? ”
54359	54368	54369	54369	he	66	“ Yeah , we ’re doing that stuff , ”
54395	54403	54381	54381	He	66	“ We ’re doing all the stuff . ”
54423	54443	54444	54444	I	0	“ Her mother was wearing a coat when I ran into them . Mink by the look of it , ”
54479	54491	54472	54472	I	0	“ How do you know what kind of fur it was ? ”
54492	54509	54510	54510	I	0	“ Because I do . She grew up in that building . We ’re so different . ”
54608	54614	54615	54615	Angie	67	“ Why do you care ? ”
54711	54726	54727	54727	Angie	67	“ What about a scarf ? Those Upper East Side girls love a neckerchief . ”
54760	54785	54786	54786	Angie	67	“ Do n’t scrunch up your face like it ’s made of dog shit — it ’s a seven - hundred - dollar scarf , ”
54796	54802	54803	54803	I	0	“ It ’s not right , ”
54806	54816	54817	54817	she	67	“ Is she not a neckerchief kind of gal ? ”
54856	54863	54838	54838	I	0	“ I do n’t think so . ”
54975	54982	54983	54983	Angie	67	“ Who uses a passport holder ? ”
54992	55008	54983	54983	Angie	67	“ So what ’s she like , this girl who has you buying her gifts ? ”
55009	55019	55020	55020	I	0	“ She does n’t have me buying her gifts . ”
55035	55051	55052	55052	Grace	66	“ She invited me to her birthday . It ’s polite to bring a present . ”
55090	55097	55069	55069	she	1158	“ She ’s not like that . ”
55098	55127	55061	55061	she	1158	“ Okay , Mr. Sensitive . You have to admit that this is a watershed moment . You ’ve never agonized over buying a woman a gift before . ”
55128	55134	55135	55135	I	0	“ I ’m not agonizing , ”
55138	55150	55135	55135	I	0	“ I just want to get something that will suit her . ”
55151	55168	55061	55061	she	1158	“ Then tell me what she ’s like . Maybe that will give us some ideas . ”
55169	55174	55175	55175	I	0	“ She ’s nice . ”
55188	55197	55175	55175	I	0	“ Funny . Passionate about what she does . ”
55198	55217	55218	55218	Angie	67	“ And when you say , ‘ what she does ’ , you mean she does you passionately . ”
55241	55247	55220	55220	her	67	“ Do n’t say that . ”
55248	55269	55270	55270	She	67	“ Jesus . Calm down . I ’m making a joke . You ’ve got it bad , my friend . ”
55290	55321	55284	55284	I	0	“ Sorry , I did n’t mean to snap . I just want to find this present and get out of here . You know I hate places like this . ”
55358	55379	55355	55355	She	67	“ Fine . But there are plenty of pretty things here , Sam . You just need to pick one . ”
55418	55452	55453	55453	Angie	67	“ I took her to the Frick for dinner on our first date and she seemed to like that . Maybe I could do something like that again ? Rather than a gift . ”
55458	55470	55455	55455	her	67	“ What , like you took her to the visitor café ? ”
55471	55500	55455	55455	her	67	“ No . I hired the place out on a Saturday night . We took in the paintings and had a nice dinner in one of the rooms . ”
55545	55548	55549	55549	I	0	“ What ? ”
55552	55560	55549	55549	I	0	“ You hired out the entire Frick ? ”
55561	55564	55573	55573	she	67	“ Yes . ”
55565	55571	55573	55573	she	67	“ For your first date ? ”
55579	55590	55591	55591	Angie	67	“ Yes . And she seemed to like it so — ”
55594	55613	55614	55614	She	67	“ I bet she did . That ’s the stuff of fairytales . You really like this girl . ”
55647	55650	55651	55651	she	67	“ Sam , ”
55657	55672	55651	55651	she	67	“ You really like this girl . The Frick ? That ’s serious shit . ”
55673	55699	55637	55637	Angie	67	“ It ’s no big deal . I just thought she ’d like it and I did n’t want to be bothered by the crowds . ”
55700	55723	55724	55724	I	0	“ It is so a big deal . That ’s the kind of shit a guy pulls when he ’s in deep . ”
55736	55749	55724	55724	I	0	“ Well , I ’m not in deep . You know me . ”
55750	55754	55755	55755	Angie	67	“ I do , ”
55761	55779	55780	55780	She	67	“ That ’s why it ’s so exciting . I think you may be falling in love . ”
55804	55810	55796	55796	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
55830	55867	55826	55826	her	67	“ It ’s not ridiculous . It ’s wonderful , Sam . I thought it may never happen . I ’m so glad because it ’s such an amazing feeling — you deserve all the happiness . ”
55879	55898	55826	55826	her	67	“ It ’s nothing like that . Do n’t get too excited . We ’re just hanging out . ”
55899	55918	55976	55976	she	67	“ I ca n’t wait to tell Chas . And the four of us can go on dates . ”
55919	55939	55826	55826	her	67	“ Angie . Seriously , stop . I need to find a gift and you ’re being no help . ”
55994	56003	55986	55986	I	0	“ Promise me I wo n’t lose you . ”
56014	56032	56004	56004	Angie	67	“ I love my husband . He ’s a good man and we can talk about everything . ”
56040	56060	56033	56033	Her	67	“ But what you and I went through ca n’t be understood by anyone who has n’t experienced it . ”
56098	56116	56085	56085	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? I ’ve not been able to shake you so far . ”
56117	56152	56153	56153	I	0	“ I mean it , Sam . What if Grace and I do n’t get along ? We wo n’t be able to spend so much time together ; we ’ll gradually lose contact . ”
56159	56185	56153	56153	I	0	“ You ’re being crazy . I ’m not in love with Grace and you and I will be friends until the end of time . ”
56186	56193	56194	56194	Her	67	“ I ca n’t lose you . ”
56201	56219	56194	56194	Her	67	“ I want you to be happy , but I want to be a part of that . ”
56232	56241	56220	56220	I	0	“ You ’re not going to lose me . ”
56242	56248	56249	56249	Angie	67	“ You ’re hugging me , ”
56252	56266	56249	56249	Angie	67	“ I ’ve known you fifteen years and you ’ve never hugged me . ”
56267	56273	56274	56274	She	67	“ Just go with it . ”
56283	56290	56291	56291	I	0	“ I will never leave you , ”
56294	56301	56291	56291	I	0	“ You will never lose me . ”
56460	56466	56467	56467	Harper	68	“ Is he here yet ? ”
56482	56498	56473	56473	I	0	“ No . You ’ll know when you see him . How ’s the baby ? ”
56499	56542	56557	56557	She	1173	“ The baby ’s a baby . She does n’t do much . I want to hear about Sam . Is he the first man you ’ve dated with a real job ? Does he know what to do with his tongue ? ”
56543	56553	56554	56554	I	0	“ You know we ’re in public , right ? ”
56578	56582	56583	56583	Max	78	“ Happy birthday , ”
56592	56596	56583	56583	Max	78	“ Thank you . ”
56597	56601	56602	56602	Sam	66	“ Happy birthday , ”
56704	56709	56696	56696	He	66	“ You look beautiful . ”
56739	56744	56745	56745	he	66	“ I ’m Sam , ”
56751	56758	56745	56745	he	66	“ and this is Angie Jenkins . ”
56783	56788	56789	56789	I	0	“ Angie , hi , ”
56954	56968	56969	56969	I	0	“ So , your husband ’s working tonight ? What does he do ? ”
56973	56983	56984	56984	Her	67	“ He has a small construction company in Jersey . ”
57000	57021	56984	56984	Her	67	“ He ’s working all hours at the moment on an office building they ca n’t touch during the day . ”
57022	57069	57070	57070	I	0	“ Oh , that ’s tough , but I ’m really pleased you could make it . I ’m just sorry it ’s for something like this and not somewhere where it ’s just us . I ca n’t wait to get to know you better . ”
57082	57103	57104	57104	She	67	“ Do n’t be , it was nice of you to invite me . Sam really wanted me to come . ”
57118	57127	57128	57128	I	0	“ So , you live in New Jersey ? ”
57134	57168	57131	57131	She	67	“ Yeah , my whole life . Thought it would be the last place I ’d want to spend married life but Chas will never leave , so I guess I ’m stuck . ”
57200	57210	57211	57211	Angie	67	“ I heard you grew up in his building ? ”
57217	57233	57214	57214	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m sure he refers to me as the Park Avenue princess . ”
57239	57276	57234	57234	Angie	67	“ I have n’t noticed him say that , but then , as I ’m sure you ’re finding out , he only says a fraction of what goes on in that big brain of his . ”
57277	57300	57301	57302	The waiters	282	“ That ’s for sure . I have to stop myself from asking him what he ’s thinking eleven times an hour . ”
57323	57336	57374	57374	her	1199	“ So , you ’re spending a ton of time together then ? ”
57348	57359	57374	57374	her	1199	“ Yeah , though I have n’t known him long . ”
57360	57369	57374	57374	her	1199	“ You have to take care of him , ”
57385	57404	57370	57370	she	1199	“ I ’ve never seen him so taken with a woman . He likes you an awful lot . ”
57432	57442	57443	57443	Angie	67	“ I like him an awful lot , too . ”
57450	57455	57443	57443	Angie	67	“ I hope so . ”
57456	57463	57443	57443	Angie	67	“ You do n’t believe me ? ”
57464	57491	57443	57443	Angie	67	“ It ’s not that . It ’s just that he ’s never liked anyone . And I imagine you ’ve had other boyfriends . . . ”
57492	57556	57443	57443	Angie	67	“ It ’s different for me , too . Maybe not as much as it is for Sam , but he ’s not like any of my previous boyfriends . He keeps so much inside , and yet he ’s the most open and honest man I ’ve ever met . I will do everything not to hurt your friend , I promise . ”
57557	57561	57562	57562	she	1200	“ Thank you , ”
57565	57582	57562	57562	she	1200	“ I ’m sorry . I do n’t mean to come across as overprotective . . . ”
57583	57601	57602	57602	Angie	67	“ I do n’t blame you . It ’s nice that you look out for each other . ”
57605	57655	57602	57602	Angie	67	“ When I started dating Chas , he and Sam came to blows one night when Sam saw him talking to a woman at a bar . Sam did n’t ask any questions , just saw red and punched him . We ’re a little protective of each other . ”
57709	57716	57717	57717	I	0	“ Does he have a temper ? ”
57728	57777	57723	57723	Angie	67	“ No , not at all . I ’ve never seen him like that before or since . But there is so little he cares about in this world — I think he ’d throw himself in front of a train for the things that matter to him . ”
57868	57872	57873	57873	he	66	“ You okay ? ”
57894	57907	57908	57908	He	66	“ I ’m sorry I did n’t sit you next to me . ”
57916	57929	57910	57910	his	66	“ Do n’t be sorry . I ’m fine talking to Harper . ”
57930	57945	57946	57946	He	66	“ No , I mean I ’m sorry for me . I miss you . ”
57956	57966	57948	57948	his	66	“ You ’re not enjoying your conversation with Angie ? ”
57967	57988	57948	57948	his	66	“ Oh yes , of course . She ’s so nice and clearly adores you . I just miss you . ”
57989	57996	57997	57997	he	66	“ I ’m here , Princess , ”
58007	58011	57997	57997	he	66	“ With you . ”
58170	58179	58180	58180	Harper	68	“ So , are you serious about Grace ? ”
58183	58188	58189	58189	Max	78	“ Excuse my wife , ”
58192	58220	58189	58189	Max	78	“ She ’s a total pain in the ass . Harper , do n’t pressure the poor guy . They ’ve only been dating a few weeks . ”
58224	58248	58221	58221	I	0	“ It ’s fine . You can ask me anything . If I do n’t want to answer , I ’ll tell you . ”
58259	58276	58277	58277	she	68	“ You said you knew with me from the moment I walked into King & Associates , ”
58282	58295	58296	58296	Max	78	“ I want to know if it was the same for Sam . ”
58310	58318	58319	58319	Harper	68	“ So , was it the same ? ”
58322	58346	58319	58319	Harper	68	“ I ’m not quite sure what you mean , but of course I thought Grace was attractive when I first met her . ”
58347	58356	58357	58357	Her	68	“ So you ’re not serious about her ? ”
58410	58425	58406	58406	Angie	67	“ Like Max said , we ’ve only been dating a couple of weeks . ”
58426	58438	58439	58439	Harper	68	“ But , you ’re official ? You ’re her boyfriend ? ”
58487	58494	58484	58484	Harper	68	“ Are you fucking other women ? ”
58495	58499	58500	58500	Her	68	“ Absolutely not . ”
58542	58551	58552	58552	Harper	68	“ And she ’s not fucking anyone else , ”
58617	58623	58624	58624	I	0	“ I care about her , ”
58655	58663	58664	58664	Harper	68	“ Well , I should hope so , ”
58667	58684	58664	58664	Harper	68	“ She ’s very special . If you hurt her , I ’ll hunt you down . ”
58685	58697	58698	58698	I	0	“ There ’s something you should know about me , Harper , ”
58705	58730	58698	58698	I	0	“ There are n’t many people in my life I care about , and I like it that way . Grace is an exception . ”
58731	58739	58740	58740	Grace	66	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
58784	58787	58788	58788	I	0	“ You , ”
58791	58802	58803	58803	she	68	“ Harper , are you giving him a hard time ? ”
58806	58827	58828	58828	I	0	“ No more than I deserve . She cares about you , and that ’s only ever a good thing , ”
58887	58893	58881	58881	she	68	“ You ’re so sweet . ”
58894	58913	58914	58914	Grace	66	“ No , I ’m not . But I do care about you , and so does Harper . ”
58924	58932	58933	58933	she	68	“ I care about you , too , ”
58936	58949	58950	58950	Max	78	“ So , you guys will have to come up to Connecticut , ”
58970	58973	58974	58974	Harper	68	“ Yes ! ”
58977	59022	58974	58974	Harper	68	“ If you can put up with a houseful of crazy , that is . We ’d love to have you . Next month when the pool house is finished . Then you can have a reprieve from the madness when you need it . ”
59023	59031	59032	59032	Grace	66	“ Well , I do n’t know , ”
59039	59042	59032	59032	Grace	66	“ Maybe . ”
59076	59084	59067	59067	I	0	“ I think that would be great . ”
59093	59097	59090	59090	she	68	“ You do ? ”
59098	59101	59109	59109	she	68	“ Absolutely . ”
59113	59119	59120	59120	Harper	68	“ That ’s settled then , ”
59147	59164	59165	59165	Max	78	“ You know these girls will drink too much and leave us to handle the kids , ”
59168	59176	59165	59165	Max	78	“ I think we can handle it . ”
59290	59304	59281	59281	Harper	68	“ Grace told me she saw the picture when she was with you . ”
59312	59318	59287	59287	her	68	“ Was she very upset ? ”
59319	59322	59323	59323	I	0	“ Who ? ”
59326	59329	59330	59330	Harper	68	“ Grace , ”
59333	59340	59330	59330	Harper	68	“ when she saw the painting . ”
59366	59370	59361	59361	I	0	“ The picture ? ”
59371	59388	59391	59391	she	68	“ The Renoir in the front window of a gallery a few stores down from hers . ”
59400	59408	59391	59391	she	68	“ She said she loved that picture . ”
59420	59446	59409	59409	I	0	“ That was the picture her grandfather gave her as a child — she loves it . It ’s what started her obsession with art . ”
59463	59507	59508	59508	Harper	68	“ She sold it so she could open the gallery . Handpicked the buyer because she wanted someone to love it as much as she did . Then the weasel up and sold it on within six months , can you believe it ? ”
59514	59541	59508	59508	Harper	68	“ She ’s heartbroken about it . Almost asked her father for the money to buy it back , but of course , she wo n’t . ”
59549	59580	59581	59581	Harper	68	“ She ’s so desperate not to be her mother , but this painting is emotional for Grace — it ’s not about the money , never is with Grace . ”
59656	59660	59661	59661	she	68	“ Thank you , ”
59668	59674	59661	59661	she	68	“ You ’re very welcome . ”

59765	59775	59776	59776	She	68	“ I know how you feel about material things . ”
59856	59881	59882	59882	I	0	“ You know that it ’s not that I think material things are frivolous . Just that they do n’t hold meaning for me . ”
59922	59927	59909	59909	She	68	“ It ’s fine . ”
59928	59939	59940	59940	I	0	“ I have n’t given you a birthday gift yet , ”
59943	59953	59940	59940	I	0	“ I did go shopping — I took Angie . ”

59970	60002	60003	60003	I	0	“ I got you something very small , for now . I want to get you something else — I think I know what , but I have n’t had time . ”
60019	60026	60003	60003	I	0	“ This one I wrapped myself . ”
60027	60031	60032	60032	She	68	“ You did ? ”
60043	60051	60052	60052	I	0	“ You have n’t opened it yet . ”
60058	60083	60052	60052	I	0	“ I do n’t need to . I like that you wrapped it yourself — that ’s the best thing you could have said . ”
60144	60149	60150	60150	I	0	“ Go on then , ”
60180	60188	60189	60189	she	68	“ Oh Sam , I love it , ”
60215	60221	60208	60208	her	68	“ That ’s so thoughtful . ”
60287	60295	60281	60281	She	68	“ I feel the same , Sam . ”
60324	60333	60296	60296	I	0	“ I did n’t know what to buy . ”
60334	60339	60340	60340	she	68	“ This is perfect , ”

60603	60612	60613	60613	Her	68	“ The feeling ’s mutual , Sam Shaw . ”
60625	60665	60620	60620	I	0	“ Tell me about the painting that we saw in the window . Harper said you sold it to pay for the gallery and that it was the piece that started your love of art . Is that true ? ”
60685	60727	60676	60676	She	68	“ It ’s been sold . I found out yesterday . I walked by the gallery and it was gone , so I could n’t help but ask what had happened to it . Some buyer from the Middle East apparently . ”
60735	60743	60728	60728	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , Grace . ”
60744	60764	60765	60765	I	0	“ As much as I loved it , it gave me my gallery . I should n’t be sad . ”
60787	60796	60797	60797	She	68	“ I wish I could make it better . ”
60812	60820	60799	60799	her	68	“ Harper should n’t have mentioned it . ”
60821	60837	60799	60799	her	68	“ I ’m glad she did . I want to know what ’s troubling you . ”

60902	60912	60876	60876	She	68	“ I love how much she cares about you . ”
60913	60927	60928	60928	I	0	“ Did she threaten violence ? I think Angie might have . Subtly . ”

60946	60966	60967	60967	She	67	“ She told me the story about you punching her husband because you thought he was cheating on her . ”
60978	60988	60967	60967	She	67	“ That was the last time I hit someone . ”
60989	60998	60999	60999	she	67	“ Have you punched a lot of people ? ”
61006	61020	60999	60999	she	67	“ I ’ve done what I ’ve needed to protect myself and Angie . ”
61078	61093	61094	61094	she	1255	“ I ’m sorry , Sam . I wish I could make it better , ”

61656	61672	61673	61673	he	1258	“ Why would you think I could do without this any more than you could ? ”

62307	62312	62313	62313	he	1258	“ Hey , beautiful , ”
62327	62333	62313	62313	he	1258	“ Is it too much ? ”

63256	63268	63253	63253	I	0	“ And we do n’t have to spend every night together . ”
63372	63383	63361	63361	Sam	66	“ You do n’t want to stay at my place ? ”
63387	63392	63361	63361	Sam	66	“ I like Brooklyn . ”
63393	63406	63407	63407	He	66	“ Because it ’s your place , or for some other reason ? ”
63419	63429	63430	63430	I	0	“ Park Avenue is n’t really my thing anymore , ”
63440	63451	63430	63430	I	0	“ I ’m not the princess you think I am . ”

63520	63529	63517	63517	I	0	“ Do n’t you want some time apart ? ”
63533	63541	63530	63530	He	66	“ I like things how they are . ”
63591	63622	63581	63582	This guy	325	“ It ’s just easier for me to stay at my place . I have all my clothes in Brooklyn . Occasionally I even have food in the refrigerator and — ”

63670	63681	63658	63658	he	66	“ Okay . So I ’ll buy a new bed . ”
63710	63724	63695	63695	he	66	“ You do n’t think it ’s easier to come to my place ? ”
63808	63826	63827	63827	Sam	66	“ Okay , well we can keep sleeping in Brooklyn if that ’s what makes you happy . ”

64349	64379	64340	64340	She	67	“ First time staying with friends . First evening with Max and Harper on our own . I mean , I have no idea who we are in public . ”
64404	64411	64412	64412	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
64415	64460	64412	64412	I	0	“ Well , are we one of those affectionate couples who ca n’t stop touching each other ? Are we the type who bicker ? Do we laugh at each other ’s jokes even though we ’ve heard them before ? Who are we ? ”
64461	64488	64526	64526	I	0	“ You ’re crazy . Let ’s just be who we are . You ’re still you . I ’m still me . Even in public . ”

64644	64658	64659	64659	she	1307	“ That ’s Max ’s fifteen - year - old daughter , Amanda , ”
64667	64682	64659	64659	she	1307	“ The baby is Amber . Lizzie , the youngest , is probably sleeping . ”
64709	64718	64719	64719	She	68	“ I ’m so excited you ’re here . ”
64727	64735	64736	64736	Max	78	“ Harper ! I need your boob , ”

65026	65041	65023	65023	Amanda	120	“ In France , kids my age have wine with dinner , you know . ”
65042	65051	65052	65052	Max	78	“ Well , we ’re not in France , ”
65094	65097	65098	65098	Amber	121	“ Down , ”
65122	65128	65129	65129	she	120	“ What are you thinking ? ”
65139	65151	65152	65152	Harper	68	“ He ’s thinking this seems a lot like a zoo , ”

65190	65196	65187	65187	Max	78	“ Amanda ’s making lasagna . ”
65197	65207	65208	65208	Amanda	120	“ But you ’re going to help , right ? ”
65217	65264	65208	65208	Amanda	120	“ I ’m going to be here , but you can do this . You ’ve watched me make it a thousand times . You ’re going to college in a couple of years . You need to learn how to cook . I spoil you . ”
65347	65363	65327	65327	Amanda	120	“ You mean I need to learn how to cook because I ’m a girl . ”
65364	65387	65388	65388	Max	78	“ No , you need to learn because you should be able to feed yourself decent meals . Stop being a pain . ”
65400	65408	65409	65409	he	78	“ We ’ll sit here and watch , ”
65466	65477	65478	65478	Max	78	“ Get everything you ’ll need out on the counter , ”

65520	65562	65563	65563	I	0	“ The market is tough at the moment , but I think that ’s an opportunity . It stops people from playing the real estate market like it ’s a game of blackjack , which ca n’t be a bad thing . ”
65570	65582	65563	65563	I	0	“ I saw you ’re developing that site by Battery Park . ”
65583	65600	65621	65622	new people	1323	“ Yeah . It ’s such a great location . It ’s underutilized at the moment . ”

66335	66353	66354	66354	Harper	68	“ She ’s always taken men on like projects . Guys that need fixing , or nurturing , ”
66357	66360	66361	66361	Grace	66	“ Harper , ”
66376	66384	66385	66385	Harper	68	“ You give and give and give , ”
66391	66414	66385	66385	Harper	68	“ until you ’re bled dry . It ’s like you ’re permanently breastfeeding these losers ! You ’ve been dating children . ”
66418	66427	66428	66428	I	0	“ Well , I do n’t need fixing , ”
66491	66499	66500	66500	Grace	66	“ We all need a little fixing , ”
66542	66560	66561	66561	I	0	“ I think Harper ’s trying to tell you that you ’re kind and generous and loving , ”
66564	66572	66573	66573	Max	78	“ In the way only Harper can , ”
66576	66586	66590	66590	she	68	“ Of course that ’s what I ’m saying , ”
66596	66609	66610	66610	she	68	“ Did I just turn into your commis chef without realizing it ? ”
66618	66629	66630	66630	Max	78	“ She has us both wrapped around her little finger , ”
66643	66651	66652	66652	Amanda	120	“ Just grate enough for the topping , ”
66655	66660	66661	66661	Harper	68	“ Yes , ma’am , ”
66670	66719	66661	66661	Harper	68	“ Look , what I ’m trying to say is you are one of the kindest , sweetest , most generous and loyal people in the world . . . and I do n’t think the men you ’ve dated so far have come close to deserving you . ”
66720	66739	66740	66740	Grace	66	“ I ’m so happy we ’re talking about this in front of Sam . I really am , ”
66770	66780	66781	66781	I	0	“ It ’s nothing I did n’t already know , ”
66784	66791	66781	66781	I	0	“ So you approve of Sam ? ”
66796	66803	66792	66792	Amanda	120	“ You think he deserves Grace ? ”
66811	66818	66819	66819	Harper	68	“ So far , so good , ”
66822	66839	66840	66840	Max	78	“ Do n’t take that personally , Sam . She says the same thing about me , ”
66863	66869	66870	66870	Amanda	120	“ How can you tell ? ”
66873	66877	66878	66878	Harper	68	“ Tell what ? ”
66881	66887	66888	66888	Amanda	120	“ That he deserves Grace , ”
66891	66906	66907	66907	Harper	68	“ Well , from what Grace tells me — and from what I see . ”
66922	66933	66912	66912	she	68	“ He ’s thoughtful and caring and makes her laugh . ”
66954	66974	66975	66975	Harper	68	“ Remember , you have to judge men on what they do , and not just what they say , ”
66978	66993	66994	66994	Max	78	“ Amanda does n’t need dating advice , but thank you , my sweet , ”
66997	67008	67009	67009	Harper	68	“ I wish someone had given me that advice sooner , ”
67012	67031	67009	67009	Harper	68	“ No , that ’s not what I mean . I wish I ’d followed that advice sooner . ”
67032	67042	67043	67043	Max	78	“ I think things worked out just about perfectly , ”
67065	67070	67071	67071	Max	78	“ Drink your wine , ”
67074	67091	67071	67071	Max	78	“ I ’ll get this . She ’s getting tired and needs to have a bath . ”
67092	67102	67103	67103	Harper	68	“ And that is why I married the guy , ”
67106	67113	67103	67103	Harper	68	“ He ’s a total DILF . ”
67114	67117	67118	67118	Amanda	120	“ Harper ! ”
67130	67135	67127	67127	her	120	“ Are you okay ? ”
67173	67181	67182	67182	Amanda	120	“ Are you going to marry Sam ? ”
67208	67211	67205	67205	Grace	66	“ Maybe . ”
67212	67217	67218	67218	Amanda	120	“ Why only maybe ? ”
67274	67286	67287	67287	Max	78	“ Amanda , you should n’t ask people such personal questions , ”
67290	67307	67287	67287	Max	78	“ Why not ? It ’s just Grace . She asks me much more personal questions . ”
67361	67381	67382	67382	Grace	66	“ You ’re right . I do ask you personal questions and there should n’t be a double standard , ”
67385	67401	67382	67382	Grace	66	“ Sam and I have n’t known each other very long , but maybe someday . ”
67449	67453	67454	67454	I	0	“ Excuse me , ”
67468	67479	67454	67454	I	0	“ I ’ll get our bags out of the car . ”
67510	67519	67520	67520	Grace	66	“ I ’m sorry for saying that earlier , ”
67532	67551	67520	67520	Grace	66	“ About marriage , I mean . I know we ’re going a million miles an hour and — ”
67552	67555	67556	67556	I	0	“ Hey , ”
67581	67600	67601	67601	I	0	“ You have nothing to be sorry for . I like knowing how you feel about these things . ”
67626	67633	67614	67614	She	1366	“ Did I freak you out ? ”
67634	67648	67661	67661	she	1366	“ You did n’t say anything wrong . Why would I freak out ? ”
67732	67744	67745	67745	she	1366	“ Are you telling me you ’ve thought about marrying me ? ”
67756	67763	67748	67748	she	1366	“ No , I have n’t . ”
67781	67797	67773	67773	Her	1366	“ But you ’re the only woman I ’ve ever cared about in this way . ”
67820	67833	67807	67807	I	0	“ Talk to me . Is marriage what you ’re looking for ? ”
67834	67842	67843	67843	she	1366	“ Not for the sake of it , ”
67853	67883	67843	67843	she	1366	“ I do n’t understand . Do you want a family , the children , the chaos — all the responsibility ? Is that what you see for yourself ? ”
67884	67893	67894	67894	She	1366	“ For myself and the man I love . ”
67910	67915	67904	67904	she	1366	“ No , Grace . ”
67929	67939	67940	67940	I	0	“ I ’m not a man you should love . ”
67962	67977	67978	67978	she	1366	“ What do you mean , you ’re not a man I can love ? ”
68054	68064	68065	68065	Her	1366	“ Surely I get to choose who I love ? ”
68112	68130	68072	68072	her	1366	“ I ’m just saying you ca n’t chose me . And if you do . . . ”
68131	68146	68198	68198	Her	1366	“ What ? You ’re going to leave me ? Because I love you ? ”
68157	68176	68152	68152	She	1366	“ Do n’t say that . You ca n’t love me . And I can never love you . ”
68188	68197	68198	68198	Her	1366	“ You ’re an asshole , Sam Shaw . ”
68206	68226	68198	68198	Her	1366	“ You ’ve spent the last few months being the best man I ’ve ever known after my father . ”
68277	68329	68273	68273	I	0	“ What am I supposed to do ? Just ignore how wonderful you are — how special you make me feel ? I love you . And if you do n’t love me then we ’ll go our separate ways , but you ca n’t tell me not to love you . ”
68513	68516	68517	68517	I	0	“ Grace , ”
68520	68525	68517	68517	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
68542	68548	68549	68549	She	1366	“ Can I come in ? ”
68647	68660	68630	68630	she	1366	“ Grace , I ’m not trying to fuck you over here . ”
68695	68704	68666	68666	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . This is just — ”
68705	68713	68714	68714	She	1366	“ Too much . I knew it . ”
68724	68760	68719	68719	I	0	“ Let me finish . I know I ’ve upset you , but you have to let me explain . Coming here . . . it ’s brought up a lot of stuff for me . ”
68774	68796	68766	68766	she	1366	“ Stuff about my parents . Things I never even think about because the memories cut like thousands of tiny blades . ”
68797	68803	68804	68804	she	1366	“ What kind of things ? ”
68880	68899	68873	68873	She	1366	“ Being here reminds me of my childhood home . The place I lived before my parents died . ”
68911	68930	68873	68873	She	1366	“ It ’s just brought up some memories that I ’ve spent a long time trying to forget . ”
68931	68938	68939	68939	she	1366	“ You never talk about them , ”
68949	68994	68939	68939	she	1366	“ I know , but it ’s not just you . I do n’t talk with anyone about this anymore . My parents are n’t ever coming back , so it always seemed easier to forget they were ever there in the first place . ”
69024	69042	69043	69043	Her	1366	“ When I think about what I had — everything I lost — the pain comes back . ”
69071	69117	69118	69118	She	1366	“ I lost my whole world when my parents died . I felt like I was being punished for something I did n’t do , sent to jail for crimes I had n’t committed . Their deaths were unjust and the consequences just as unmerited . ”
69148	69188	69143	69143	I	0	“ Forgetting about them was my escape . I never wanted to go through anything like that again — and I ’ve made sure I have n’t . Unwittingly , I made a vow never to love anyone again . ”
69189	69207	69208	69208	I	0	“ But you care about me , Sam , I know you do . I feel it . ”
69227	69248	69208	69208	I	0	“ I do . But it was n’t something I was looking for , and it was n’t a choice . ”
69249	69254	69255	69255	she	1366	“ I ’m sorry , ”
69258	69267	69255	69255	she	1366	“ I should n’t have brought you here . ”
69280	69319	69271	69271	I	0	“ Of course you should . I had no idea seeing Max and Harper ’s family would bring back so many memories for me . And seeing you with them — you deserve the same kind of happiness . ”
69320	69330	69363	69363	she	1366	“ You do n’t want marriage or a family ? ”
69339	69350	69363	69363	she	1366	“ I ’ve never thought that would be my journey . ”
69374	69380	69381	69381	she	1366	“ Lift your arms up , ”
69391	69394	69395	69395	She	1366	“ Here . ”
69407	69486	69395	69395	She	1366	“ That ’s who you are . I know you ’re an orphan , a victim , a child in mourning . But you ’re an optimist , too . Do n’t you see ? The thing about the Count is that he might have had to wait years , he might have had to dig tunnels and fight pirates , but he finds his ultimate bliss at the end . Life is a storm , my love . ”
69550	69566	69567	69567	I	0	“ Storms will come , Sam , but I want us to face them together . ”
69572	69583	69567	69567	I	0	“ I want us to face the storms together too . ”
69655	69661	69662	69662	I	0	“ The peace is nice , ”
69668	69690	69665	69665	Max	78	“ Yeah . The house is so chaotic sometimes , it ’s good to spend a couple of hours in silence . ”
69691	69697	69698	69698	I	0	“ But you like it , ”
69701	69705	69698	69698	I	0	“ The chaos ? ”
69706	69744	69745	69745	I	0	“ Of course . I love my family , but that does n’t mean I do n’t still like to escape the crazy . That ’s why we ’re out here when it ’s so damn cold . ”
69805	69837	69918	69918	he	78	“ My father and I used to come fishing to escape the three girls back home . Sometimes Violet joined us , but normally it was just me and my dad . ”
69838	69843	69918	69918	he	78	“ Does Harper mind ? ”
69844	69868	69869	69869	I	0	“ Not at all . She counts the minutes I take out here and makes sure she gets her alone time , too . ”
69872	69878	69869	69869	I	0	“ That seems fair enough . ”
69879	69911	69912	69912	Max	78	“ It works for us both . But I also make sure Harper and I spend time together — it ’s so easy for it to become all about the kids . ”
69980	69988	69989	69989	I	0	“ It ’s a lot of pressure . ”
69995	69999	70000	70000	Max	78	“ What is ? ”
70011	70039	70000	70000	Max	78	“ Clearly , having three kids has logistical challenges , but do you find yourself worrying about losing it all or something happening to one of them ? ”
70073	70097	70067	70067	he	78	“ Every day . Amanda going to high school nearly killed me — all the exposure to drugs and alcohol , you know ? ”
70110	70121	70122	70122	He	78	“ She ’ll be driving in just over a year . ”
70125	70181	70122	70122	He	78	“ I have to try not to think about what the hell could happen to the babies . Harper may seem like she ’s super cool with everything , but she ’s anything but . A few weeks after Amber was born , I insisted on taking Harper to dinner while my mother was visiting . ”
70189	70263	70264	70264	He	78	“ Now , my mother has had three kids of her own , and she had Amanda with her . She can drive , use a phone and is far calmer than either Harper or me . But still , Harper cried all the way to the restaurant because she was terrified something horrible was going to happen to Amber in the two hours it was going to take us to eat dinner . ”
70273	70297	70264	70264	He	78	“ Being responsible for another human being is the scariest thing you ’ll ever do , but it ’s also the most rewarding . ”
70301	70318	70298	70298	Max	78	“ It ’s a legacy , and infinitely more important than any business you might build . ”
70383	70416	70417	70417	Max	78	“ But I can control the success of my business to a certain extent — I can make decisions that keep my money safe . The same ’s not true of people . ”
70445	70451	70452	70452	he	78	“ You a football fan ? ”
70466	70469	70461	70461	I	0	“ Nope . ”
70470	70477	70461	70461	I	0	“ Baseball ? Any sports team ? ”
70478	70487	70461	70461	I	0	“ Hockey . New York Rangers . You ? ”
70488	70493	70461	70461	I	0	“ The Red Sox . ”
70494	70504	70507	70507	he	78	“ Really ? In a land of Yankee fans ? ”
70515	70558	70507	70507	he	78	“ What can I say ? I like to take risks . I mean , Jesus , you ’re a hockey fan . Anyway , you do n’t follow a team knowing they ’re going to win every time , do you ? ”
70559	70570	70571	70571	He	78	“ Definitely not if you ’re a Red Sox fan . ”
70574	70665	70571	70571	He	78	“ That ’s life , is n’t it ? There are no guarantees . But it ’s something else when your team wins , right ? You know you ’re not going to win every year . You still support them through the rough times . Kids are the same . You know a lot of it is going to be hard , and you ’re going to worry a lot . But it ’s all worth it when they smile and tell you they love you . Trust me . ”
70842	70851	70852	70852	I	0	“ It ’s so good to be home . ”
70891	70900	70901	70901	Sam	66	“ You did n’t have a good time ? ”
70931	70944	70914	70914	I	0	“ Of course . But I ’m always happy to come home . ”
70945	70953	70954	70954	Sam	66	“ Do you know what I missed ? ”
70979	70989	70990	70990	I	0	“ How long have you been in that state ? ”
71002	71006	71007	71007	he	66	“ All weekend , ”
71010	71016	71017	71017	I	0	“ It ’s been torture . ”
71020	71035	71017	71017	I	0	“ Thank you for not dry humping me in front of Max and Harper . ”
71076	71084	71085	71085	He	66	“ Well , my control is up . ”
71093	71105	71085	71085	He	66	“ I want to show you what you ’ve been missing . ”
71140	71147	71148	71148	he	66	“ What are you looking at ? ”
71165	71169	71162	71162	I	0	“ Some guy . ”
71170	71185	71186	71186	he	66	“ Some guy who thinks you ’re the most beautiful woman on the planet ? ”
71214	71217	71218	71218	I	0	“ Maybe , ”
71331	71341	71360	71360	he	66	“ Some guy who is the most special man . ”
71342	71359	71360	71360	he	66	“ Some guy who ’s going to work really hard at being the man you deserve , ”
71454	71465	71444	71444	He	66	“ Is that the way your pussy asks for attention ? ”
71473	71484	71485	71485	he	66	“ Do n’t hold back . I like you needy , ”
71523	71526	71504	71504	he	66	“ Please , ”
71545	71548	71549	71549	he	66	“ There , ”
71557	71591	71549	71549	he	66	“ I like to hear everything . Even if it means we fight and then make up . I want to know everything that ’s going on in your head , my princess . ”
71592	71596	71597	71597	I	0	“ Kiss me , ”
71603	71611	71597	71597	I	0	“ But do n’t move your hand . ”
71626	71636	71637	71637	he	66	“ You feel so good , like coming home , ”
71778	71784	71785	71785	he	66	“ You ready , Princess ? ”
71799	71802	71803	71803	I	0	“ Always , ”
71815	71835	71836	71836	He	66	“ I ’ve wanted you so bad all weekend . We have a lot of catching up to do . ”
71872	71878	71879	71879	I	0	“ I ’ve missed this , ”
71882	71886	71879	71879	I	0	“ Missed you . ”
71887	71895	71896	71896	He	66	“ You never need to miss it . ”
71905	71917	71898	71898	himself	66	“ I ’m going to try , for you , Grace . ”
71959	71962	71963	71963	Sam	66	“ Fuck , ”
71975	71991	71992	71992	he	66	“ I was so close — too close — I want to make this last , ”
72032	72037	72038	72038	he	66	“ I ’m sorry , ”
72045	72053	72038	72038	he	66	“ I have no control around you . ”
72054	72059	72060	72060	He	66	“ That ’s okay . ”
72189	72199	72200	72200	he	66	“ Jesus , I love it when you come , ”
72259	72262	72263	72263	he	66	“ Christ , ”
72281	72286	72274	72274	I	0	“ Fuck , Grace . ”
72352	72357	72344	72344	his	66	“ You ’re all mine ”
72359	72362	72344	72344	his	66	“ Forever . ”
72363	72373	72374	72374	Sam	66	“ I think we should definitely get a car , ”

76351	76367	76349	76349	he	66	“ I do n’t think so . They want to keep you here for observation . ”
76368	76384	76385	76385	Harper	68	“ The nurse said they did a CT scan , so what ’s the problem ? ”
76399	76410	76411	76411	I	0	“ Did you speak to him ? Where is he ? ”
76449	76473	76434	76434	she	68	“ Dad , would you mind getting me a magazine or a book or something for me to read when you ’re gone ? ”

76720	76738	76702	76702	He	1545	“ Yeah , but when he ’d seen you he told me that he had to leave . ”
76739	76749	76750	76750	She	1546	“ Did he say when he was coming back ? ”
76762	76784	76750	76750	She	1546	“ I ’m sure he ’ll be back soon . I think he ’s feeling bad about the accident — guilty . ”

76911	76930	76896	76896	I	0	“ His parents died in a car accident . It must have brought back some memories for him . ”
76940	76953	76896	76896	I	0	“ Do you have my phone ? I need to call him . ”
76954	76964	76896	76896	I	0	“ I do n’t . Maybe Sam has it ? ”
76965	76999	76896	76896	I	0	“ Harper , I need to see him . Tell him I ’m okay . He ’s hurting , and he does n’t have anyone . I need to be there for him . ”

77292	77315	77288	77288	he	66	“ Yeah , that would be nice , but have you seen my phone ? I thought I had it right here . ”
77367	77389	77390	77390	I	0	“ You think Sam ’s phone was damaged in the crash ? Maybe that ’s why I ca n’t get through , ”
77407	77424	77404	77404	She	68	“ Even if it was , why would n’t he have come back to the hospital ? ”
77443	77484	77425	77425	Harper	68	“ It ’s totally understandable that he needed a break from everything after the accident . It must have been a lot to take on considering what happened to his parents and the car crash . Do n’t you agree ? ”
77507	77514	77515	77515	she	68	“ Do you need a hand ? ”

77554	77585	77547	77547	I	0	“ I ’m fine when I ’m up . It ’s just standing in the first place that ’s hard . I ’m not used to balancing on one leg . ”
77593	77608	77586	77586	I	0	“ Walking on crutches has got to be good for my core , right ? ”
77674	77701	77702	77702	I	0	“ Who cares ? I do n’t have a core . My children ripped it from my body along with my dignity when I gave birth . ”
77713	77722	77723	77723	She	1557	“ Stop it . You love your girls . ”
77726	77743	77723	77723	She	1557	“ I do . But they need to understand the price I paid to have them . ”
77744	77766	77767	77767	I	0	“ The problem is when I ’m hobbling on crutches , I ca n’t drink because I have no free hands . ”
77788	77804	77779	77779	Harper	68	“ You think he ’s okay ? He could have had an accident . . . ”
77805	77830	77831	77831	She	1557	“ I do n’t think he ’s been in an accident , Grace , and neither do you , if you ’re being honest . ”
77839	77848	77831	77831	She	1557	“ You think he ’s being an asshole ? ”
77849	77884	77779	77779	Harper	68	“ It ’s pretty weird that he ’s left without so much as a word . And it ’s been days . You ’ve been discharged and he ’s still not here for you . ”
77885	77890	77779	77779	Harper	68	“ He ’s hurting . ”
77891	77894	77895	77895	she	1557	“ Maybe , ”
77898	77913	77895	77895	she	1557	“ But so are you . This accident could have been a lot worse . ”
77914	77920	77779	77779	Harper	68	“ But it was n’t . ”
77921	77950	77895	77895	she	1557	“ I just think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you may never hear from him again . He seems like he could be ghosting you . ”
77961	77966	77967	77967	Harper	68	“ Are you okay ? ”
78079	78087	78088	78088	I	0	“ Can I get a top up ? ”
78138	78164	78136	78136	he	66	“ We ’re happy together , Harper . Why would you think that he ’d just disappear and never want to speak to me again ? ”
78165	78184	78136	78136	he	66	“ You know as well as I do that logic does n’t apply when it comes to men . ”

78388	78438	78377	78377	I	0	“ Let ’s see how you feel on Sunday . And when you do go back you should stay at my apartment in the city . Cab fare will be a lot cheaper than if you go to Brooklyn . You ca n’t take the subway for a while . ”

78484	78526	78377	78377	I	0	“ Grace , I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . He ’ll call you or he wo n’t . You ’re in no state to be running after him . You need to be concentrating on getting better . ”
78527	78556	78557	78557	I	0	“ You do n’t understand how I feel about him . This is it for me . I will never love any man the way I love him . ”
78578	78597	78557	78557	I	0	“ Will you come with me ? Or do you think I ’m being such an idiot that — ”
78598	78611	78377	78377	I	0	“ Idiot or not , of course I ’ll come with you . ”
78612	78616	78557	78557	I	0	“ Monday then . ”
78636	78650	78651	78651	I	0	“ We can go to his office and I can prove you wrong . ”
78657	78688	78651	78651	I	0	“ But if you ’re right and he ’s walking away from me , for whatever reason , then he ’s going to have to say it to my face . ”
78694	78699	78700	78700	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
78816	78833	78834	78834	Angie	67	“ So you ’re not dead . Thank you for finally answering your God damn cell . ”
78931	78942	78943	78943	I	0	“ I ’m busy , Angie . What is it ? ”
79044	79070	79037	79037	I	0	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? You and Grace were in a car accident on Monday and you did n’t think to tell me ? ”

79291	79317	79318	79318	I	0	“ I ’m fine , Angie . Grace is fine . We ’re just over . That ’s all . It ’s no big deal . ”
79376	79379	79380	79380	she	67	“ Sam , ”
79422	79431	79418	79418	she	67	“ Sam , I ’m worried about you . ”
79505	79510	79511	79511	Angie	67	“ What was that ? ”
79524	79532	79533	79533	I	0	“ Nothing . I dropped my drink . ”
79565	79572	79555	79555	I	0	“ Are you okay , Sam ? ”
79573	79598	79637	79637	Angie	67	“ I told you , I ’m fine . Not a scratch on me . And Grace is fine . She ’s been discharged . ”
79599	79620	79621	79621	I	0	“ And how would you know that ? She said she has n’t heard from you since she woke up . ”
79786	79790	79791	79791	I	0	“ Come in , ”
79841	79888	79833	79833	Rosemary	102	“ Sorry to disturb you but I thought I should let you know that there ’s a woman in reception who wants to see you . When I explained you were busy all day , she just told me she ’d wait and took a seat . ”
79915	79924	79925	79925	Rosemary	102	“ I do n’t know what to do , ”
79932	79951	79925	79925	Rosemary	102	“ She looks like she might sit there all day . Do you want me to call security ? ”
79952	79959	79960	79960	I	0	“ Did you get her name ? ”
79970	79983	79960	79960	I	0	“ Grace Astor . I think she ’s been here once before . ”
80004	80016	79984	79984	I	0	“ Show her in and I ’ll see why she came . ”
80017	80020	80021	80021	She	102	“ Okay . ”
80024	80045	80021	80021	She	102	“ Can I help in any way ? Is she waiting for payment ? She would n’t tell me anything . ”
80046	80062	80063	80063	I	0	“ I have no idea what she wants , but I ’ll deal with her . ”
80162	80166	80167	80167	Rosemary	102	“ Grace Astor , ”
80292	80299	80300	80300	I	0	“ Sam , look at me . ”
80364	80377	80378	80378	I	0	“ Why are you here ? You should be resting at home , ”
80381	80387	80388	80388	she	74	“ Why am I here ? ”
80392	80398	80388	80388	she	74	“ Where have you been ? ”
80404	80424	80399	80399	Her	74	“ Why have n’t you answered any of my calls or messages ? It ’s like you just disappeared . ”
80461	80471	80449	80449	I	0	“ Things got too heavy too quickly between us . ”
80489	80500	80477	80477	Her	74	“ I ’ve had a chance to re - evaluate . ”
80516	80523	80524	80524	she	74	“ I do n’t believe you , ”
80571	80585	80586	80586	she	74	“ It ’s been a week . What could have changed so much ? ”
80592	80611	80589	80589	I	0	“ I ’m sorry if I led you to believe our brief fling was something it was n’t . ”
80667	80689	80690	80690	I	0	“ Sam , do n’t talk like that . I know you do n’t mean it . You ’re just scared . ”
80695	80711	80712	80712	I	0	“ I do n’t want to get serious with you , so I ’m scared ? ”
80738	80786	80728	80728	She	1592	“ Yes , Sam . You ’re scared of opening yourself up . Scared of loving me . But I ’m here , by your side , and we ’re going to weather the storms together . Do n’t you remember ? You said you ’d try . ”
80834	80857	80826	80826	I	0	“ I ’m not scared of anything . I just do n’t have feelings for you . You need to accept that . ”
80873	80882	80868	80868	she	1594	“ Well , I do n’t accept that . ”
80895	80913	80914	80914	She	1594	“ There ’s nothing I can help you with . Do n’t make a fool of yourself . ”
80990	81005	81006	81006	I	0	“ You should go , Grace . Can I call a car for you ? ”
81089	81092	81086	81086	she	1594	“ Sam ! ”
81133	81139	81126	81126	I	0	“ You need to leave . ”
81140	81160	81161	81161	she	1594	“ I know you ’re hurting , and I know that the accident must have been horrible for you , ”
81164	81174	81161	81161	she	1594	“ But I ’m fine . You ’re fine . ”
81237	81242	81243	81243	she	1594	“ I love you , ”
81324	81340	81314	81314	I	0	“ I ’ve told you I do n’t feel the same . You should go . ”
81341	81344	81345	81345	Her	1594	“ Sam . ”
81365	81376	81352	81352	she	1594	“ Please do n’t do this . I need you . ”
81405	81412	81399	81399	I	0	“ Good luck , Ms. Astor . ”
81447	81452	81453	81453	I	0	“ Please just drive , ”
81489	81506	81480	81480	Harper	68	“ Can we go through the Upper West Side ? I just ca n’t . . . ”
81547	81551	81552	81552	Harper	68	“ No problem , ”
81563	81569	81570	81570	Her	68	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
81735	81743	81744	81744	I	0	“ Maybe he just needs more time , ”
81752	81761	81762	81762	she	68	“ Did he say he needed more time ? ”
81781	81801	81762	81762	she	68	“ No , he told me he did n’t love me , but I know that ’s not true . ”
81802	81807	81747	81747	Harper	68	“ Does it matter ? ”
81808	81820	81747	81747	Harper	68	“ Of course it matters . If he loves me then — ”
81821	81828	81829	81829	she	68	“ It takes more than love , ”
81832	81853	81829	81829	she	68	“ If he ’s telling you he does n’t love you , you have to take him at his word . ”
81854	81902	81903	81903	I	0	“ But do n’t you see ? He ’s doing it to protect himself . He does n’t want to love me — he does n’t want to love anyone in case he loses them and has to go through what he did when his parents died . ”
81970	81981	81958	81958	he	66	“ Do n’t you see ? It does n’t matter . ”
81982	81993	81994	81994	He	66	“ What do you mean ? Of course it matters . ”
82014	82030	81958	81958	he	66	“ The outcome ’s the same . Whatever his reasons , he ’s ended it . ”
82031	82037	82038	82038	I	0	“ Do n’t say that , ”
82050	82064	82038	82038	I	0	“ He ’ll come around . I just need to give him time . ”
82065	82083	82084	82084	Harper	68	“ You need to give you time . And then you should get on with your life . ”
82114	82136	82101	82101	she	68	“ Now ’s not the time for your tough love . I have to believe Sam will come back to me . ”
82159	82169	82147	82147	I	0	“ I ca n’t just give up on him . ”
82170	82255	82256	82256	I	0	“ Look , I believe in the fairytale . I really do . Look at my husband , for crying out loud . But , you ’re my best friend and I ca n’t bear to see you hurting like this . Whether or not he loves you , he ’s not with you , showing his love . And if you ca n’t see it , ca n’t feel it , then I ’m not sure it matters what he feels deep down . ”
82295	82305	82281	82281	I	0	“ You do n’t know him like I do . ”
82347	82396	82397	82397	She	1624	“ Of course I do n’t , but I know what I see — a man who abandoned you when you needed him most . That rejected you when you gave him the benefit of the doubt and went to his office to tell him you loved him . ”
82400	82414	82397	82397	She	1624	“ And that ’s the only side of him I need to see . ”
82422	82429	82430	82430	she	1624	“ We should make a plan , ”
82440	82472	82430	82430	she	1624	“ Let ’s have a fire in the pit tonight and make s’mores . We ’ll put the patio heaters on and wrap up in blankets . What do you say ? ”
82473	82480	82481	82481	Harper	68	“ Does this plan involve wine ? ”
82486	82496	82481	82481	Harper	68	“ Would n’t be a party without the wine . ”
82500	82504	82481	82481	Harper	68	“ Sounds good . ”
82505	82512	82513	82513	Harper	68	“ Have you spoken to Natalie ? ”
82541	82576	82577	82577	Harper	68	“ I messaged her this morning . Everything ’s fine . I think she likes being left to her own devices . I ’ll probably go back and she wo n’t let me in . ”
82586	82641	82577	82577	Harper	68	“ Maybe while you ’re in Connecticut you should think some more about your plan for the place . I know some of the work you love most you do n’t really sell . You know , the more traditional stuff . Have you thought about splitting the gallery in two and doing both ? ”
82676	82702	82796	82796	She	1628	“ It wo n’t work . I do n’t have the right contacts to get the traditional art in the gallery . Or the money . ”
82703	82728	82796	82796	She	1628	“ Remember you said you could never have a gallery of your own without your father ’s money and look how that turned out . ”
82729	82738	82739	82739	I	0	“ But I had to sell my Renoir . ”
82760	82795	82796	82796	She	1628	“ You sold that painting to get Grace Astor Fine Art . Do n’t take your foot off the gas now . If you let it , the gallery could be a great focus . ”
82846	82852	82853	82853	she	1628	“ Do n’t you think ? ”
82859	82862	82856	82856	I	0	“ Sure . ”
82863	82897	82898	82898	I	0	“ Maybe Max can introduce you to some of his rich clients . In fact , why do n’t you start running parties in your gallery ? Maybe Max can host something there ? ”
82942	82951	82952	82952	I	0	“ Yes , bring it in this side , ”
83198	83201	83202	83202	I	0	“ Hey , ”
83205	83214	83202	83202	I	0	“ How are you ? You look beautiful . ”
83215	83223	83224	83224	She	70	“ Stop it . You invented beautiful . ”
83229	83246	83247	83247	She	70	“ I brought you lunch — I figured if I did n’t you would n’t eat . ”
83254	83261	83262	83262	I	0	“ You ’re good to me , ”
83265	83277	83262	83262	I	0	“ But I need to finish up with this delivery first . ”
83278	83282	83325	83325	She	70	“ No problem . ”
83283	83291	83292	83292	Scarlett	70	“ Hey , do I look cool ? ”
83295	83298	83292	83292	Scarlett	70	“ Cool ? ”
83299	83319	83320	83320	I	0	“ You know , like it ’s just another day and I ’m not going to explode with excitement . ”
83328	83342	83325	83325	She	70	“ Yeah , babe , you always look cool . Are you excited ? ”
83343	83347	83348	83348	I	0	“ Hell yes . ”
83355	83370	83348	83348	I	0	“ There ’s a freaking Gauguin in this lot . Can you believe that ? ”
83411	83430	83431	83431	Scarlett	70	“ Hey , I ’ve heard of that guy . Is n’t he like in museums and shit ? ”
83438	83449	83431	83431	Scarlett	70	“ I knew that this place would be a smash . ”
83450	83465	83431	83431	Scarlett	70	“ Well , I ’m not sure smash is the right word . . . ”
83484	83495	83477	83477	I	0	“ You should be so proud of yourself , Grace . ”
83496	83516	83517	83517	I	0	“ It was all Harper ’s idea . She was trying to give me a focus after . . . ”
83520	83524	83517	83517	I	0	“ You know . ”
83574	83592	83564	83564	Harper	68	“ Yeah , but you took it and ran with it . You made it all happen . ”
83634	83657	83619	83619	people	1826	“ I ’ve gotten great sales on both the nights we ’ve had these things — I hope we do again tonight . ”
83658	83685	83619	83619	people	1826	“ Well , that ’s because people ca n’t resist your good taste and charm . Speaking of , are any of the men dating material ? ”
83686	83697	83698	83698	I	0	“ I thought you had your hands full with Duncan ? ”
83701	83723	83698	83698	I	0	“ Not for me , silly . For you . I ’m sure a couple of them have asked you out . ”
83724	83730	83731	83731	I	0	“ Oh , not really . ”
83757	83764	83765	83765	she	1642	“ None of them your type ? ”
83768	83789	83765	83765	she	1642	“ Honestly , I ’m not looking for anything right now . I just want to concentrate on my business . ”
83851	83868	83842	83842	I	0	“ Duncan has a friend who ’d like to meet you . You ’d like him . ”
83869	83882	83886	83886	people	1826	“ Thanks , but I ’m not dating anyone at the moment . ”
83918	83924	83908	83908	I	0	“ Can we drop it ? ”
83925	83930	83931	83931	Mark	131	“ Hey , Grace , ”
83947	83960	83961	83961	I	0	“ I ’m done in the back and going to head out . ”
83983	83993	83964	83964	Scarlett	70	“ Okay , did you leave them in order ? ”
84045	84070	84020	84020	he	131	“ Mark , this is Scarlett . Scarlett , Mark is one of the new artists who ’s going to be exhibiting with us . ”
84071	84077	84085	84085	she	70	“ Nice to meet you , ”
84173	84191	84192	84192	I	0	“ Thanks for letting me have input on the curation , Grace , I really appreciate it . ”
84200	84213	84192	84192	I	0	“ No problem . It ’s really great to get your view . ”
84214	84230	84249	84249	she	70	“ I was wondering if I could take you to dinner as a thank you ? ”
84263	84272	84273	84273	I	0	“ There ’s no need to do that , ”
84276	84283	84273	84273	I	0	“ All part of the job . ”
84346	84367	84341	84341	He	131	“ I understand . Let me know if there ’s anything you need , otherwise let ’s speak next week . ”
84368	84371	84372	84372	I	0	“ Sure , ”
84384	84408	84380	84380	Scarlett	70	“ Grace , he is gorgeous . Why on earth did you turn him down ? I thought he was just your type . ”
84438	84450	84436	84436	Sam	66	“ No , he ’s not my type . Not anymore . ”
84451	84479	84538	84538	her	1653	“ Dinner would n’t hurt though . A girl ’s got ta eat . You might like him if you spent a bit of time with him . ”
84480	84490	84491	84493	The delivery guys	460	“ I told you ; I ’m not dating . ”
84503	84522	84491	84493	The delivery guys	460	“ I do n’t think you should shut yourself off from men completely . It ’s been months . ”
84523	84535	84536	84536	She	1653	“ Please , Scarlett , I asked you to drop it . ”
84544	84555	84536	84536	She	1653	“ Sorry . I just want you to be happy . ”
84556	84581	84582	84582	I	0	“ And I appreciate it . So make me happy by telling me what you brought us for lunch . Does it include alcohol ? ”
84585	84601	84602	84602	She	1653	“ Because I could do with a little buzz to get me through this afternoon . ”
84605	84624	84602	84602	She	1653	“ Yeah , I ’m not sure my employers would be so lenient on me for day drinking . ”
84625	84640	84641	84641	I	0	“ Maybe not . You ’re in charge of the money , after all . ”
84656	84673	84648	84648	she	1653	“ We ’ll have to make do with pine nut , arugula and goat cheese salad . ”
84767	84770	84771	84771	I	0	“ Coming , ”
84815	84822	84823	84823	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? ”
84876	84883	84869	84869	I	0	“ How did you find me ? ”
84898	84918	84884	84884	Angie	67	“ I ’m resourceful . When your best friend disappears for eight fucking weeks , you find a way . ”
84919	84925	84869	84869	I	0	“ I did n’t disappear . ”
84926	84955	84869	84869	I	0	“ You moved out — I sat outside your door for twenty - four hours , so I ’d be sure . And you stopped answering my calls . ”
84956	84967	84884	84884	Angie	67	“ You ’re here now . What do you want ? ”
84982	85022	84979	84979	Angie	67	“ I want you to explain what the fuck you ’re trying to do by ignoring my calls . Presumably you ’re avoiding me ripping you a new asshole because you ’ve abandoned Grace when she needed you most . ”
85059	85086	85050	85050	I	0	“ There ’s no avoiding this conversation , Sam . We ’re family . And family tells each other when someone ’s making a huge mistake . ”
85216	85226	85227	85227	I	0	“ Jesus . You could have just said no . ”
85235	85240	85241	85241	she	67	“ It smells disgusting , ”
85253	85265	85241	85241	she	67	“ It absolutely does not . It smells like expensive whiskey . ”
85272	85285	85241	85241	she	67	“ Well , it smells like dog shit to a pregnant woman . ”
85307	85317	85295	85295	she	67	“ Congratulations . I ’m really happy for you . ”
85318	85322	85342	85343	a baby	2247	“ Fuck you . ”
85323	85336	85295	85295	she	67	“ What ? I ’m happy for you . I mean it . ”
85350	85361	85362	85362	I	0	“ You ’re going to be the godfather , asshole . ”
85370	85379	85362	85362	I	0	“ No , Angie , I ’m not . ”
85393	85422	85423	85423	She	67	“ I ’m not giving you a choice . You ’re the only person in my life I totally trust — the person who knows me the best . ”
85438	85478	85423	85423	She	67	“ I have no one else to ask . So , there ’s no disappearing out of my life , out of our lives . Do you get that ? I ca n’t handle it . I need you . ”
85483	85515	85479	85479	I	0	“ It ’s not a good idea . You ca n’t need me , Angie . I ’ll just end up disappointing you . Or one of us will die and — ”
85516	85521	85522	85522	Angie	67	“ Just stop it , ”
85535	85541	85530	85530	she	67	“ You ’re so dramatic . ”
85569	85579	85580	85580	she	67	“ And now I need you more than ever , ”
85583	85654	85580	85580	she	67	“ I have this tiny human parasite in me and it ’s going to arrive in seven months . I have no idea what I ’m doing and I ’m sure I ’m going to melt down at least once a day . The only thing I learned from my mom was how to be a crack whore . I want to save those lessons until my daughter ’s eighteen . ”
85655	85662	85678	85678	her	67	“ You ’re having a girl ? ”
85683	85691	85678	85678	her	67	“ Yeah . Can you believe it ? ”
85697	85702	85678	85678	her	67	“ It ’s amazing . ”
85703	85710	85678	85678	her	67	“ I need you , Sam . ”
85711	85716	85678	85678	her	67	“ You have Chas . ”
85717	85749	85750	85750	She	67	“ I need him , too . But do n’t you get it ? You ’re my family . I ’ve been abandoned once — don’t do it to me again . ”
85774	85796	85797	85797	I	0	“ And you ca n’t do it to my daughter , either . She ’s going to need you , too . ”
85802	85808	85797	85797	I	0	“ I ’m right here . ”
85835	85843	85833	85833	family	1059	“ I ’m so sorry for disappearing . ”

85866	85879	85863	85863	Angie	67	“ So , you ready to be an uncle to this kid ? ”
85880	85887	85888	85888	I	0	“ Not even a little bit . ”
85893	85909	85888	85888	I	0	“ All you have to do is love her . That ’s all I ask . ”
85910	85920	85863	85863	Angie	67	“ I think you ’re asking the wrong man . ”
85946	85974	85975	85975	I	0	“ You ca n’t live without love , Sam . If you try , you might as well have died in that car right alongside your parents . ”
85992	86000	85986	85986	she	67	“ Do n’t say stuff like that . ”
86009	86062	86063	86063	She	67	“ I know you do n’t like to talk about them , but I also know the man you are . Not the guy people see from the outside — not what your parents ’ deaths did to you — the man who ’s left when everyone else except me is gone . ”
86073	86118	86063	86063	She	67	“ I know what ’s in here . I know who your parents created while they were alive . A man who would lay down his life for me . Loyal . Determined . Fierce . Someone who ’s capable of giving great love . ”
86149	86159	86137	86137	Angie	67	“ You ’re going to be an amazing mother . ”
86160	86237	86238	86238	I	0	“ If I ’m not , it ’s all your fault . You convinced me I could do this . And I ’m determined I ’m going to do my best by this kid . I owe it to my daughter , to Chas , but most of all to me . You told me I should n’t let my past determine my future . But neither should you , my friend . You deserve Grace . ”
86251	86289	86238	86238	I	0	“ That ’s what your parents would want for you , Sam . A great love . Someone who deserves you . Someone like Grace . I think they would have loved the way she loves you . ”
86321	86331	86301	86301	them	1671	“ She does n’t love me . Not anymore . ”
86343	86353	86301	86301	them	1671	“ And that ’s the way it should be . ”
86354	86381	86392	86392	I	0	“ No , Sam , that ’s not how it should be at all . What you and Grace have does n’t come along that often . ”
86425	86449	86417	86417	I	0	“ What if something happened to her , if she left me somewhere down the line ? I just would n’t handle it . ”
86450	86470	86417	86417	I	0	“ Be the guy she ’s never going to want to leave and let the universe decide the rest . ”
86471	86498	86417	86417	I	0	“ The universe ? That ’s your answer ? That ’s no guarantee . I would n’t survive losing her . I know I would n’t . ”
86523	86588	86589	86589	I	0	“ I think you ’re the strongest guy I know . You can survive anything . Let your parents ’ deaths teach you that . Let it have been a demonstration of your strength . Do n’t let their deaths make you live in fear . Honor your mom and dad by living your best life , and loving as hard as you can . ”
86627	86635	86612	86612	they	199	“ I do n’t think I can . ”
86636	86665	86666	86666	I	0	“ Let me ask you this : would you have preferred not having those first twelve years with your parents ? Never to have known them at all ? ”
86876	86880	86881	86881	I	0	“ Sam Shaw , ”
87259	87262	87263	87263	Grace	66	“ Sam ? ”
87323	87326	87327	87327	I	0	“ Hi , ”
87330	87336	87327	87327	I	0	“ You look . . . ”

87348	87355	87356	87356	she	1686	“ What are you doing here ? ”
87367	87382	87356	87356	she	1686	“ I came to apologize and explain . I just need a few minutes . ”
87446	87468	87440	87440	I	0	“ You ’re the first woman I ’ve ever loved and the only one I ever will . I messed up . ”
87481	87539	87475	87475	she	1686	“ If I ’d known I ’d meet you , that I ’d feel how I do , I ’d have practiced . Made my mistakes , gotten them out of the way before you came along . But I had no idea what love could feel like . You are beyond my imagination , Grace Astor . ”
87569	87603	87604	87604	Her	1686	“ You taught me to see myself as an optimist . And I know myself to be a fighter . I ’m not giving up on you . Ever . I love you . ”
87614	87620	87608	87608	she	1686	“ I brought you this , ”
87656	87667	87651	87651	Grace	74	“ Sam , no , I do n’t need anything . ”
87682	87687	87653	87653	her	74	“ It ’s yours . ”
87688	87698	87653	87653	her	74	“ No , you do n’t have to buy — ”
87699	87711	87653	87653	her	74	“ It ’s yours . Whatever happens , it ’s yours . ”
87803	87812	87813	87813	I	0	“ Please , Grace , just open it . ”
87891	87895	87896	87896	I	0	“ My Renoir , ”
87913	87933	87896	87896	I	0	“ You brought it back to me . How did you find — oh , Sam , the cost . ”
87934	87953	87969	87969	him	66	“ Shhh , please do n’t think about it . It was always yours . And so was I. ”
87954	87962	87963	87963	I	0	“ You know , it ’s funny , ”
87971	88021	87963	87963	I	0	“ I always thought I ’d get it back one day . I was devastated when I had to sell it , but even when I delivered it to the buyer , I believed it would be mine again one day . A bit like you , Sam Shaw . ”
88022	88027	88028	88028	His	66	“ But . . . ”
88040	88062	88063	88063	I	0	“ I do n’t need the big speeches and the expensive paintings — just you . I only ever needed you , ”
88072	88078	88066	88066	His	66	“ I do n’t deserve — ”
88079	88086	88087	88087	I	0	“ You deserve to be happy , ”
88090	88143	88087	88087	I	0	“ And I deserve to be with the love of my life . Which is you . I know that . I ’ve always known that . But I need you to understand that you ca n’t run from me when the storm comes , Sam . We have to stick together . ”
88147	88163	88144	88144	He	66	“ I get it . Really , I do . I ’ll never leave again . ”
88170	88179	88164	88164	I	0	“ Good . I hate being without you . ”
88192	88222	88186	88186	he	66	“ You never have to be . Honestly , Grace , I want to prove it to you . I want to give you everything you want and deserve . ”
88223	88230	88186	88186	he	66	“ And what do you want ? ”
88231	88262	88186	88186	he	66	“ I want you . I want you to move in with me tonight . I want to make up for lost time . I want to marry you tomorrow . ”
88263	88270	88271	88271	I	0	“ You want to marry me ? ”
88278	88300	88271	88271	I	0	“ Of course I want to marry you . You are the love of my life — I want it all . ”
88301	88307	88308	88308	I	0	“ Is that a proposal ? ”
88330	88338	88339	88339	I	0	“ Do you want it to be ? ”
88346	88353	88339	88339	I	0	“ I just got you back . ”
88354	88395	88341	88341	my	0	“ So , today your answer ’s a no — but I ’m going to keep asking until you ’re ready . If it takes a hundred years , one day , Grace Astor , you will be my wife . ”
88396	88408	88339	88339	I	0	“ Oh ? And what makes you so sure of that ? ”
88409	88412	88413	88413	he	66	“ Because , ”
88424	88463	88413	88413	he	66	“ you taught me the most important lesson in the Count ’s story . ‘ Happiness is like those palaces in fairytales whose gates are guarded by dragons : We must fight in order to conquer it . ’ ”
88470	88479	88464	88464	He	66	“ I wo n’t ever stop fighting again . ”
88482	88486	88487	88487	I	0	“ Marry me ? ”

88784	88807	88773	88773	she	74	“ I ’ve asked you every day for the last fifty - eight days — were you expecting me to say no ? ”
88840	88847	88848	88848	I	0	“ This means we ’re engaged , ”
88854	88860	88851	88851	She	74	“ I need a ring . ”
