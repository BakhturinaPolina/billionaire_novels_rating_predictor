1091	1100	1101	1101	he	10	“ How long have you been standing there ? ”
1104	1113	1101	1101	he	10	“ I could ask you the same thing . ”
1426	1448	1457	1457	Mandy	13	“ I ’m just having a drink , and staring over at our glorious city . The many secrets it hides . ”
1449	1456	1457	1457	Mandy	13	“ My parents called again today , ”
1567	1632	1545	1545	He	134	“ Lewis , are you there ? Mandy , honey , we just want to see you . To know that you ’re all right . Lewis , this has gone far enough , and if you do n’t allow us to see your daughter soon , I ’m going to be seeing what I can do . I ’ll talk to your father . ”
1644	1672	1641	1641	he	134	“ I do n’t want to see them , but I think I want to tell them that to their face if you ’d come with me . ”
1678	1685	1673	1673	Lewis	10	“ You want to do that ? ”
1686	1693	1694	1694	Her	135	“ They gave up , Lewis . ”
1712	1727	1700	1700	he	10	“ I do n’t want you to do anything that you do n’t want . ”
1728	1734	1735	1735	she	135	“ They had another daughter , ”
1744	1749	1735	1735	she	135	“ They replaced me . ”
1750	1757	1700	1700	he	10	“ They kept looking for you . ”
1758	1783	1735	1735	she	135	“ No , they did n’t . You kept looking . They did n’t even hire a private investigator . They did n’t care . ”
1795	1799	1784	1784	Lewis	10	“ They cared . ”
1800	1915	1916	1916	She	137	“ After a year of being taken , I really thought I was going to be rescued . I caused a lot of trouble . Nearly died from the beatings I got . I did n’t want that life . I wanted to skip and dance , and go to high school . I wanted to fall in love . There was so much pain there and death . One of the men came back , and he had footage and information . The cops had stopped looking . My parents had moved on . Over the years he ’d come back with new footage . Show them laughing in a park or something . ”
1923	1940	1916	1916	She	137	“ You know , looking back , they never showed me anything to do with you . ”
1941	1970	1971	1971	He	138	“ I never stopped . When I realized that unless there was some sighting they were n’t going to waste time looking for you , I built this . ”
1977	2021	1971	1971	He	138	“ To find you , I needed money . The only way to get money was to earn it . That ’s what I did . While earning money , I kept spending it to find you . It took a long time . ”
2025	2080	2022	2022	She	137	“ You found me , and I found you . Seeing that picture , your name , it was like I stopped being the machine they ’d created . I came back to myself . The Mandy I am , she had to disappear . To survive , I had to become someone else . ”
2088	2095	2096	2096	He	140	“ I had to save them . ”
2107	2119	2120	2120	she	137	“ How can you not hate me when I helped them ? ”
2152	2221	2222	2222	He	10	“ I ’ve seen the scars on your body , Mandy . I know they did n’t come at your own hand but because you fought . You did n’t find these women and lure them into that life willingly . They beat you to make you submit to them . They made your life hell . There ’s no way in hell I ’d ever hate you . ”
2230	2240	2222	2222	He	10	“ You survived . That ’s all that matters . ”
2357	2367	2351	2351	she	13	“ I ’m going to make myself some tea . ”
2480	2488	2472	2472	Lewis	10	“ How are your studies coming along ? ”
2492	2499	2472	2472	Lewis	10	“ Do you want a coffee ? ”
2516	2519	2510	2510	He	10	“ Yes . ”
2520	2544	2545	2545	she	13	“ They ’re going well . They seem a bit trivial at times . Some stuff I really do n’t need to learn , ”
2652	2656	2608	2608	Lewis	10	“ Like what ? ”
2657	2666	2608	2608	Lewis	10	“ History . It seems kind of pointless . ”
2667	2691	2717	2717	She	13	“ I think it ’s good to understand where we come from , and to help us avoid the mistakes of the past . ”
2692	2716	2717	2717	She	13	“ It ’s still boring . I do like English , though . I think anything to do with reading is always fun . ”
2740	2753	2732	2732	she	13	“ You did n’t tell me how your last rescue mission went . ”
2779	2810	2774	2775	each man	165	“ It went well . We found ten girls , and they ’re being placed back with their families . We got to them before they were hurt too bad . ”
2811	2815	2754	2754	Lewis	10	“ Only ten ? ”
2816	2833	2834	2834	Mandy	13	“ Before we could get to them , the men were shooting them in the head . ”
2845	2854	2834	2834	Mandy	13	“ They ’re not alive anymore , Mandy . ”
2855	2871	2872	2872	Lewis	10	“ I figured . You would n’t let something like that happen on your watch . ”
2968	2978	2979	2979	she	13	“ You need to learn to relax a little , ”
3001	3009	3010	3010	he	10	“ The guys been talking to you ? ”
3018	3030	3031	3031	He	10	“ Just Jamie . He thinks you ’re working too hard . ”
3034	3042	3031	3031	He	10	“ It ’s none of their business . ”
3043	3106	3107	3107	She	13	“ You ’re the one who helps to find out all this information . You set up an MC to help you do it . They ’re worried about you , and they have a right to be . You put their lives in danger , and if you ’re not there to have their backs , it puts them in danger . ”
3145	3152	3153	3153	he	10	“ I would never hurt them , ”
3156	3175	3153	3153	he	10	“ I know you would n’t do it intentionally . I ’m not trying to say you would . ”
3201	3219	3220	3220	She	13	“ But one mistake could get you killed in this world . Believe me , I know . ”
3302	3312	3313	3313	she	13	“ You do n’t have to keep proving yourself , ”
3316	3363	3313	3313	she	13	“ I ’ll always have to prove myself . It ’s just the way I am . I want to help those women . It does n’t matter how many we save , more get taken , and as more get taken , more are sold . ”
3364	3375	3376	3376	She	13	“ It ’s a never - ending market , Lewis . ”
3386	3393	3376	3376	She	13	“ It ’s not your fault . ”
3394	3401	3402	3402	Her	13	“ I have to save them . ”
3435	3511	3512	3512	She	13	“ You ca n’t , Lewis . There ’s not going to be an end to this . It runs too deep , and it will never disappear . For a couple of years , it may seem like it ’s all gone . The truth is it never is . There is always someone willing to take their place , and that ’s not your fault . It wo n’t ever be your fault . ”
3585	3591	3592	3592	he	10	“ It ’s never enough , ”
3648	3657	3658	3658	She	13	“ Everything you do is more than enough . ”
3661	3723	3658	3658	She	13	“ Think about the women you ’ve already saved . The ones that were only taken for a couple of hours . They ’ve gone back to their lives , and yes , there will be nightmares , but you saved them . Granted them their freedom , Lewis . That ’s more than anyone else will ever do for them . ”
3730	3735	3736	3736	he	10	“ What about you ? ”
3739	3766	3736	3736	he	10	“ Me , you ’re my hero , Lewis . Always . When everyone else had given up , you did n’t . You found me . ”
3767	3780	3781	3781	he	10	“ Why did n’t you reach out to me when you did ? ”
3784	3797	3798	3798	She	13	“ You helped those other women , but you rarely helped yourself ? ”
3801	4011	3798	3798	She	13	“ When I saw that picture of myself , and I saw your name , I ’d never forgotten you . They tried to make me forget that I was a daughter , and a friend , and an irritating little sister . I could forget most , but not you . I ’d dream of you . I remember as they grabbed me , I screamed , and they were so fast . You were trying so hard to get to me , but I was gone . You chased after the car , crossing the road as he spun . You nearly got hit , and as they kept on holding me down , you were still following , until you nearly got hit by a car , and they were able to gain some distance . Then they drugged me , knocking me out . You fought then , Lewis . I knew that you ’d help the women that had n’t yet been sent for distribution . If I could help them , then I knew one day , you ’d come for me . I ’d been there a long time already . What was a couple more years to help you beat them ? ”
4031	4058	4028	4029	the hero	187	“ I think about that day all the time . That moment I heard you scream . I ca n’t get it out of my head . ”
4059	4072	4073	4073	She	185	“ It was a life - changing moment for both of us . ”
4076	4111	4073	4073	She	185	“ I wonder if I had n’t been taken , whether you ’d have still been that jock and married the popular girl . Had a couple of kids , and never done this . ”
4112	4122	4123	4123	Lewis	10	“ What do you think you ’d have done ? ”
4126	4134	4123	4123	Lewis	10	“ What did you want to do ? ”
4135	4156	4157	4157	She	185	“ I loved writing . I loved making stories . It ’s something that has never changed , not once . ”
4168	4182	4157	4157	She	185	“ You need to learn to take a break , have some fun . ”
4183	4190	4157	4157	She	185	“ Fun , what is that ? ”
4191	4205	4206	4206	She	185	“ I do n’t know . I was hoping you ’d tell me . ”
4499	4507	4508	4509	his PA	201	“ Sir , Jamie Breeland is here , ”
4517	4522	4523	4523	He	10	“ Send him in . ”
4537	4552	4553	4553	Jamie	15	“ Wow , since when do I have to ask permission to enter here ? ”
4566	4608	4558	4558	Lewis	10	“ You can never be too careful . Cameron follows everything by the book . I ’ll let her know that you and the other guys from the club can enter without permission , unless I ’m in an important meeting . ”
4609	4634	4635	4635	Jamie	15	“ Cameron would n’t let me pass . She ’s a hard - ass , so I do n’t see anyone getting to you . ”
4647	4654	4635	4635	Jamie	15	“ So , how are things ? ”
4655	4675	4635	4635	Jamie	15	“ Mandy has already given me the lecture that you guys think I ’m running myself into the ground . ”
4676	4692	4693	4693	Jamie	15	“ Is this to prove you ’re not giving up just because you found Mandy ? ”
4756	4759	4738	4740	fellow MC brothers	205	“ No . ”
4760	4791	4738	4740	fellow MC brothers	205	“ Look , we ’ve all been talking , and I ’m here to apologize on behalf of the club . We should n’t have pointed a finger at you . ”
4792	4797	4738	4740	fellow MC brothers	205	“ It ’s fine . ”
4802	4830	4798	4798	Lewis	10	“ There was a lot of stuff I had in place that you did n’t know about . Guys willing to find out information for a price . ”
4831	4836	4837	4837	Jamie	15	“ Are you okay ? ”
4840	4845	4837	4837	Jamie	15	“ I ’m fine . ”
4846	4851	4798	4798	Lewis	10	“ You seem tired . ”
4933	4942	4943	4943	Jamie	15	“ You know it was n’t your fault , ”
4957	4960	4952	4952	he	10	“ What ? ”
4961	4984	4985	4985	Lewis	10	“ Mandy being taken . All the years she suffered at the hands of those monsters . You ca n’t blame yourself . ”
4999	5006	4985	4985	Lewis	10	“ I watched them take her . ”
5007	5013	4952	4952	he	10	“ You were a kid . ”
5014	5029	5030	5030	Jamie	15	“ I was eighteen years old , and I knew what I was doing . ”
5033	5073	5030	5030	Jamie	15	“ The way Mandy looks at you , she does n’t blame you , Lewis . You need to start believing in yourself and forgiving yourself . If not , you ’re going to live a very miserable existence . ”
5078	5101	5102	5102	She	207	“ Sir , erm , I ’ve got a man out here claiming to be your father . He looks really angry . ”
5109	5116	5117	5117	Lewis	10	“ I ’ll be right out , ”
5120	5126	5127	5127	Jamie	15	“ She ’s a delight , ”
5130	5148	5127	5127	Jamie	15	“ Cameron ’s a hard worker . She needed a break after everything she ’s been through . ”
5205	5223	5224	5224	Lewis	10	“ Moving on from that little warning I see in your eyes . Your father is here ? ”
5227	5258	5259	5259	He	10	“ It would seem that Mandy ’s parents believe that I ’m keeping her locked up against her will . This is their way of fighting to get her back . ”
5262	5294	5259	5259	He	10	“ They said they ’d find whatever means they could to get access to her . She wants to see them face to face , and tell them to fuck off . ”
5339	5370	5371	5371	Jamie	15	“ Fine , fine , I ’ll leave you to deal with family . Are you coming to the club tonight ? Chill out , relax , take it easy ? ”
5386	5392	5381	5381	Lewis	10	“ I ’ll be there . ”
5393	5405	5406	5406	Jamie	15	“ You know it ’s going to be okay , Lewis , ”
5416	5448	5406	5406	Jamie	15	“ You ’re not alone , and you wo n’t ever be alone . We ’re all here , and we ’ve got your back . You just need to ask . ”
5509	5513	5493	5493	his	15	“ Thank you . ”
5514	5528	5529	5529	Jamie	15	“ Is it bad that I want to see who your daddy is ? ”
5550	5567	5568	5568	Jamie	15	“ You can even be introduced to my dad if you stay away from my PA . ”
5571	5583	5568	5568	Jamie	15	“ You ’re a monster . Holding my needs to ransom . ”
5601	5625	5593	5593	He	10	“ Yeah , now you ’re seeing why we ’re worried about you . When was the last time you had any fun ? ”
5675	5678	5679	5679	he	10	“ Son , ”
5682	5690	5679	5679	he	10	“ Jamie , this is my father . ”
5691	5699	5700	5700	Jamie	15	“ Nice to meet you , sir , ”
5716	5723	5709	5709	Jamie	15	“ See you around , sweetheart . ”
5729	5734	5726	5726	his	10	“ Sorry about him . ”
5735	5742	5756	5756	his	10	“ He ’s harmless , sir . ”
5743	5750	5751	5751	he	10	“ Hold my calls for me , ”
5779	5784	5789	5789	he	10	“ Yes , sir . ”
5860	5869	5870	5870	Gordon	18	“ Do you know why I ’m here ? ”
5873	5876	5870	5870	Gordon	18	“ Yes . ”
5952	5963	5945	5945	he	18	“ You ca n’t keep her away from her family . ”
5964	5971	5916	5917	a family	150	“ The family that stopped looking . ”
5972	5991	5945	5945	he	18	“ You ca n’t hold that against them . They were told to move on with their lives . ”
5992	6022	6023	6023	he	18	“ And yet I ’m the one that found her , and you think I ’m the one who ’s stopping her from getting into contact with her parents ? ”
6032	6037	6023	6023	he	18	“ You ’re not ? ”
6038	6070	6071	6072	His father	225	“ She ’s a grown - ass woman , Gordon . Mandy can do whatever the hell she wants , and does n’t need me to tell her what to do . ”
6076	6083	6071	6072	His father	225	“ They want to see her . ”
6084	6113	5945	5945	he	18	“ She does n’t want to see them . I ’m helping Mandy . That ’s all I ’ve ever wanted to do . Surely you remember that . ”
6114	6122	5945	5945	he	18	“ We made a mistake , son . ”
6123	6130	5945	5945	he	18	“ Do n’t call me that . ”
6131	6136	5945	5945	he	18	“ You were obsessed . ”
6137	6188	5945	5945	he	18	“ For the right reason . She was alive , and they were hurting her . I saved her . That ’s all I will ever do is save her , help her . You want to take me on , do it . I ’ve got nothing to hide . ”
6189	6207	5945	5945	he	18	“ They just want to see her . To hold her , to know she was okay . ”
6208	6271	5945	5945	he	18	“ Then they ’re going to have to wait . If you think for a second I ’m going to force Mandy to do something she does n’t want to do , think again . That ’s all she has ever done since she was taken at ten years old , been forced to do what she does n’t want to do . ”
6735	6745	6746	6746	she	13	“ Wow , am I getting escorted home now ? ”
6749	6762	6763	6763	He	10	“ I wanted to see you . I saw my dad today . ”
6792	6804	6774	6774	she	13	“ Are you going to make me go and see them ? ”
6805	6812	6813	6813	He	10	“ No . Not a chance . ”
6828	6850	6813	6813	He	10	“ I would never make you do anything that you do n’t want to do . I hope you believe that . ”
6851	6855	6856	6856	She	13	“ I do . ”
6859	6872	6856	6856	She	13	“ Sorry . I should n’t have thought that for a second . ”
6873	6903	6813	6813	He	10	“ I promised you that you could do whatever you wanted , and if that means you do n’t want to see them , then I ’ll handle it . ”
6904	6916	6813	6813	He	10	“ He ’s going to cause you trouble though , right ? ”
6917	6924	6925	6925	he	10	“ Do n’t parents do that ? ”
6933	6956	6928	6928	She	13	“ No . I do n’t want you to get into any trouble because of me . It ’s not worth it . ”
6957	6967	6928	6928	She	13	“ You ’re worth it , Mandy . Always . ”
7134	7151	7152	7152	Mandy	13	“ I ’ve got to head to the clubhouse tonight . Do you want to come ? ”
7307	7327	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ Can I come with you ? I do n’t want to be alone at your place right now . ”
7328	7332	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ Why not ? ”
7333	7363	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ In case your father turns up , or worse , my parents . What if they get someone to snatch me or order me to talk to them ? ”
7364	7386	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ That wo n’t happen , Mandy . You ’re a full - grown woman and can make your own decisions . ”
7387	7397	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ You yourself said they could make things difficult . ”
7398	7430	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ Yes , but only by spreading rumors . They can try to take me on , baby . It ’s not going to happen . I wo n’t let it . ”
7431	7443	7302	7302	Lewis	10	“ I ’d still rather go to the clubhouse with you . ”
7564	7569	7570	7570	he	10	“ How was college ? ”
7573	7605	7606	7606	She	284	“ It was okay . It ’s not really college , though . I ’m more like a high school kid being tutored . Some classes are boring . Others fun . ”
7609	7631	7606	7606	She	284	“ Leaving the professor ’s office , I must look like the odd one out , leaving the grounds that way . ”
7632	7675	7676	7676	She	284	“ You ’re a beautiful woman , Mandy . Do n’t let anyone get to you . You ’re where you need to be . You ’ve got this air around you . Like an aura . You ’re kind of untouchable . ”
7681	7687	7676	7676	She	284	“ Is that a line ? ”
7688	7696	7697	7697	She	284	“ Nope . That ’s the truth . ”
7929	7935	7936	7936	John	20	“ How are you doing ? ”
7939	7945	7936	7936	John	20	“ I ’m doing good . ”
7952	7966	7946	7946	She	311	“ Seems kind of mundane to learn it after everything , you know ? ”
8051	8083	8084	8084	John	20	“ This is what they took from you . Every time you do a spelling assignment , or read a paragraph , think about what they would n’t let you do . ”
8087	8143	8144	8144	He	20	“ Think of it as a way of giving the finger to those assholes . You ’re alive , Mandy . You ’re living , and they did n’t want that for you . Think about that , every time you look at a textbook and wonder what the hell you ’re doing it for . ”
8149	8162	8144	8144	He	20	“ You ’re doing it for all those women who could n’t . ”
8163	8184	8185	8185	Jamie	15	“ You ’re going to make her cry with that little speech . I happen to need some woman advice , ”
8196	8207	8185	8185	Jamie	15	“ So , there ’s this woman that I like . ”
8208	8213	8144	8144	He	20	“ O - kay . ”
8214	8229	8144	8144	He	20	“ She ’s got a kid , and she works for one of my — ”
8230	8236	8237	8237	Jamie	15	“ Stay away from Cameron . ”
8240	8250	8237	8237	Jamie	15	“ You know I ’m a very nice guy . ”
8251	8289	8144	8144	He	20	“ She ’s been through a lot , Jamie . You ’re a nice guy , I know that . You ’re also a good - time guy , and she does n’t want her heart broken . ”
8333	8339	8340	8340	Lewis	10	“ Everything seems so quiet , ”
8534	8544	8545	8545	Russ	11	“ Maybe we ’re finally getting through to them , ”
8548	8553	8554	8554	Blake	24	“ Or they know , ”
8569	8577	8557	8557	Lewis	10	“ What do you mean they know ? ”
8578	8644	8645	8645	Lewis	10	“ We have interrupted every single shipment of women for the past couple of years . If it ’s not us , then we get the cops to handle it . Do n’t you think that ’s going to look a little suspicious to some of them ? We know we do n’t get all of them . It ’s next to impossible to do . ”
8687	8697	8698	8698	Lewis	10	“ They could be trying to hunt for us , ”
8701	8716	8717	8717	Blake	24	“ Or , they may know that we have someone of value to them , ”
8739	8764	8733	8733	Mandy	13	“ Let ’s face it , she ’s been the one helping us find them . This silence could be them hunting for her . ”
8765	8772	8773	8773	Lewis	10	“ They think she ’s dead , ”
8793	8843	8844	8844	Blake	24	“ It does n’t take a lot to find out that she ’s not , Lewis . You and I both know that . As much as I hate to say this , I think if a bunch of girls suddenly go missing , we need to let them , ”
8860	8880	8881	8881	Blake	24	“ All this quiet , and if they start taking girls , I believe it ’ll be a trap . ”
8911	8929	8900	8900	Lewis	10	“ I ’ve got a guard on her . What else do you want me to do ? ”
8938	8997	8932	8932	Blake	24	“ We think it could be best if you take her to your island . Give it a couple of weeks , rest , relax . You can work from there , and then when a little time has passed , we think of a way to handle this that does n’t cause too much finger - pointing . ”
8998	9026	8900	8900	Lewis	10	“ You want me to take a break ? A vacation when we ’re just speculating about what ’s going on ? Maybe we got them all . ”
9027	9058	9059	9059	Russ	11	“ And maybe pigs might fly someday , Lewis . We ’ve been doing this too long for it to be a coincidence . You and I both know that , ”
9062	9092	9059	9059	Russ	11	“ Something is going on . Something big . What if they ’ve thought about Mandy ? What if she ’s well - known to a lot of people ? ”
9098	9103	9104	9104	Mandy	13	“ They ’re right , ”
9113	9126	9104	9104	Mandy	13	“ You ’re not getting anything . It ’s like radio silence ? ”
9131	9141	9127	9127	Blake	24	“ There ’s not even a single missing girl . ”
9170	9219	9165	9165	Lewis	10	“ Their business was always supply and demand . Not just for the auctions but for their brothels , and women on the streets . This is a worldwide network . Not just stationed in one city . You ’ve interrupted them , and saved so many girls . ”
9220	9239	9240	9240	Lewis	10	“ You could n’t have expected us to let them go . Not with the information we have , ”
9248	9271	9240	9240	Lewis	10	“ But maybe we should have . Allowed them to get a little further along in the selling process , then intervened . ”
9272	9279	9280	9280	Blake	24	“ You were part of it , ”
9283	9290	9280	9280	Blake	24	“ You were known , right ? ”
9312	9351	9306	9306	she	13	“ Yes . It ’s how I know so much . I was part of it all . I was their success story . They would show me off to the girls as if I was some queen . ”
9371	9378	9379	9379	Lewis	10	“ None of us blame you , ”
9382	9389	9390	9390	Blake	24	“ You were trying to survive , ”
9401	9463	9393	9393	She	13	“ It does n’t matter now . If they figure out that you ’ve got someone who knows everything about them , it ’s only a matter of time before they figure it out . I always hoped I ’d get away . When I saw your picture and your details , I knew this was my chance to save them . ”
9464	9472	9473	9473	Russ	11	“ You risked your life , Mandy , ”
9482	9490	9476	9476	Mandy	13	“ What do you need from me ? ”
9491	9516	9393	9393	She	13	“ They want us to go away to my private island . To take some time away . Let all of this die down . ”
9517	9529	9530	9530	Blake	24	“ I ’m thinking the club could be quiet as well , ”
9533	9544	9530	9530	Blake	24	“ Like we ’ve quit and gone our separate ways . ”
9545	9569	9393	9393	She	13	“ But we stay in touch . We keep up to date on everything . It just appears that we ’re no more . ”
9623	9632	9618	9618	Lewis	10	“ We ca n’t give up on them . ”
9633	9666	9669	9669	her	350	“ We wo n’t . This is what we do , Lewis . We ca n’t do it if they find out about Mandy , or worse , if they take her . ”
9681	9689	9676	9676	he	10	“ I ’d never let that happen . ”
9690	9750	9751	9751	She	350	“ You ca n’t watch me twenty - four - seven , Lewis . I think Blake ’s idea is right . We need to take a little break for now . This is n’t going to go anywhere . You ’ve got to think of the club , and the safety of the future girls you ’ll save . ”
9756	9762	9751	9751	She	350	“ You can do this . ”
9790	9798	9799	9799	She	350	“ I ’ll leave you to talk . ”
9821	9829	9830	9830	he	10	“ What do the other guys think ? ”
9833	9849	9830	9830	he	10	“ We ’ve all talked about it , Lewis . It ’s for the best . ”
9886	9900	9878	9878	They	353	“ I guess I better get everything together and organize some vacation time . ”
10121	10127	10128	10128	she	13	“ You ’re feeling guilty ? ”
10131	10160	10128	10128	she	13	“ Yeah . It ’s been a long road to get here . It ’s going to take some getting used to having to take a step back . ”
10934	10943	10944	10945	her guard	408	“ You do n’t have to do this , ”
10979	11008	10959	10959	He	10	“ I ’ll be back in a second . I know Lewis asks you to keep an eye on me , but I need to do this alone . ”
11009	11020	11051	11051	Her	13	“ He ’ll have my ass for this , Mandy . ”
11021	11037	11038	11038	She	13	“ I ’ll deal with him . I promise . I need to do this . ”
11158	11163	11164	11164	she	13	“ Hello , Mom , ”
11167	11174	11164	11164	she	13	“ Mandy ? Oh , Mandy . ”
11230	11236	11237	11238	her mother	412	“ Ryan , come here , ”
11261	11268	11269	11269	they	131	“ Come in , come in , ”
11321	11327	11315	11315	she	13	“ I do n’t hug . ”
11328	11339	11315	11315	she	13	“ Oh , I ’m so sorry . Of course . ”
11408	11415	11420	11420	she	13	“ Let ’s go sit down . ”
11484	11493	11494	11495	her mother	412	“ I ’ll go and make some tea , ”
11526	11536	11537	11537	he	427	“ It ’s so good to have you here , ”
11553	11566	11550	11550	she	13	“ I do n’t understand . You ’re our daughter , Mandy . ”
11585	11606	11575	11575	he	427	“ I came to tell you to stop pressuring Lewis . What you ’re doing is not fair to him . ”
11607	11615	11616	11616	She	13	“ He ’s keeping you from us . ”
11621	11637	11616	11616	She	13	“ No , he ’s not . I ’m the one deciding what I want . ”
11638	11649	11650	11650	Mandy	13	“ You ’re in no position to make that judgment . ”
11653	11660	11650	11650	Mandy	13	“ And you think you are . ”
11661	11667	11650	11650	Mandy	13	“ I ’m your father . ”
11668	11692	11616	11616	She	13	“ You stopped looking ! You gave up . Moved away and stopped looking . You had another little girl to replace me . ”
11693	11699	11650	11650	Mandy	13	“ You were never replaced . ”
11700	11710	11711	11711	she	13	“ There ’s not a single picture of me , ”
11732	11739	11711	11711	she	13	“ It hurt to see you . ”
11774	11786	11787	11788	her mother	412	“ We asked Lewis if we could see you , honey , ”
11800	11814	11787	11788	her mother	412	“ He would n’t let us . We just wanted to see you . ”
11815	11838	11839	11839	Her	13	“ I begged him not to . I did n’t want to see you . I wanted nothing to do with you . ”
11849	12021	11839	11839	Her	13	“ They told me you gave up on me . That you ’d moved on . The men that took me . made sure that I knew how easy it was for you . You say looking at my picture hurt . You do n’t have any idea what true pain or hurt feels like . I was alive ! I was begging for you to find me . You do n’t know what it was like . What it was like to be held down , to be trained for what I had to do . You think I want to sit here , drinking tea ? I ’m struggling to even look at you without remembering what those monsters did to me . How they used your life against me . I was forgotten . You were my own parents , and you forgot me . Instead , an eighteen - year - old boy did n’t give up . He never gave up on me when you did . ”
12022	12025	12125	12125	them	437	“ Mandy — ”
12026	12084	11839	11839	Her	13	“ I ’m not ready for this . I only came today to ask you to leave him alone . He ’s done everything to protect me . Do n’t make this hard for him . I ’m a grown woman . I ’ve seen things that would disgust you . Do n’t make this about yourselves . ”
12439	12448	12449	12449	she	13	“ I ca n’t believe you own this , ”
12452	12467	12468	12468	he	10	“ Yep . It was a rather luxurious purchase , do n’t you think ? ”
12471	12495	12449	12449	she	13	“ You own private jet pads and jets . I should n’t be surprised that it extended to something as luxurious as this . ”
12496	12505	12523	12523	She	13	“ I love the finer things in life . ”
12506	12514	12523	12523	She	13	“ And of course they love you . ”
12515	12519	12520	12520	he	10	“ After you , ”
12547	12554	12555	12555	she	13	“ Wow , this is amazing , ”
12572	12585	12565	12565	She	13	“ You really worked your ass off for a place like this . ”
12623	12628	12629	12629	he	10	“ You like it ? ”
12632	12637	12638	12638	She	13	“ I love it . ”
12641	12648	12638	12638	She	13	“ It feels so … serene . ”
12664	12687	12659	12659	he	10	“ Are you going to tell me what happened with your parents ? Or am I going to get the silent treatment ? ”
12705	12722	12723	12723	He	10	“ Have you seen their new place ? Like stood inside it , and seen it ? ”
12728	12731	12723	12723	He	10	“ Nope . ”
12732	12770	12779	12779	her	13	“ It ’s like every single other house up and down that street . No character , no nothing . I did n’t like it . It felt so utterly cold . I ’m sounding lame now . ”
12771	12776	12777	12777	She	13	“ Not at all . ”
12790	12832	12833	12833	He	10	“ They have so many pictures . Lots of them everywhere . None of them have me in them . They said it was too painful for me to be there . That kind of sucks . It sucked a lot . ”
12844	12862	12833	12833	He	10	“ You did n’t have to go to them . I was happy to deal with them . ”
12863	12903	12904	12904	She	13	“ I do n’t want you to deal with everything . It ’s not fair to you , Lewis . I can handle them . I should be able to , right ? I ’m after all their daughter . ”
12907	12921	12904	12904	She	13	“ Sorry . I do n’t want your vacation to be about this . ”
12922	12933	12833	12833	He	10	“ Everything about you concerns me . It always will . ”
12934	12946	12904	12904	She	13	“ You ’re a good guy . One of the best . ”
12977	12988	12989	12989	she	13	“ It did n’t take you long to organize this , ”
12996	13039	13040	13040	He	455	“ No . Cynthia , the woman I hired , she ’s amazing . She checks on it every single week for me . I pay her to do this , but she knows what I like and how I like it . ”
13045	13049	13050	13050	She	13	“ Tour time . ”
13053	13059	13050	13050	She	13	“ I want to sleep . ”
13060	13085	13086	13086	He	455	“ Not happening . It ’s still light out , and we ’re going to get used to this day and not any other . ”
13185	13231	13242	13242	He	455	“ Of course , paper books are a dying breed , and it ’s all about the e - book now . I love a good book , though . There ’s something about opening a book , smelling the pages as you turn it . ”
13232	13241	13242	13242	He	455	“ I always did think you were weird . ”
13312	13321	13322	13322	she	13	“ Because the ocean is n’t big enough ? ”
13325	13337	13338	13338	She	13	“ Nah , and what if there ’s sharks out there ? ”
13341	13349	13338	13338	She	13	“ Are you for real ? Sharks ? ”
13350	13374	13304	13304	he	455	“ It ’s an ocean , and at any time they can go off current . You never know what you could find . ”
13375	13387	13388	13388	she	13	“ The pool is a fantastic idea . I love swimming , ”
13396	13405	13391	13391	Lewis	10	“ You ’re still so funny to tease . ”
13406	13432	13338	13338	She	13	“ You ’re not funny . No matter how hard you try to be . It ’s not a funny or even a cute trait . ”
13433	13444	13445	13445	She	13	“ It ’s funny . I ’m a funny guy . ”
13448	13469	13445	13445	She	13	“ I am going to have a shower , freshen up , and I ’ll meet you in twenty minutes . ”
13470	13473	13474	13474	He	10	“ Sure . ”
13520	13528	13529	13529	Blake	24	“ You ’re there safe and alive ? ”
13532	13547	13529	13529	Blake	24	“ That I am . We ’re here , and everything is set up . ”
13548	13585	13501	13501	He	10	“ I called our contact in the local force and let him know what we ’re doing , and what ’s going down . He ’s going to keep an eye on everything on his end . ”
13599	13610	13592	13592	Lewis	10	“ He thinks there ’s a snitch on the force . ”
13611	13617	13529	13529	Blake	24	“ What do you mean ? ”
13618	13635	13592	13592	Lewis	10	“ Someone who ’s paid to look the other way , and to give some information . ”
13636	13642	13643	13643	Lewis	10	“ How does he know ? ”
13646	13705	13643	13643	Lewis	10	“ He ’s noticed a couple of guys have been asking a lot of questions about Anna ’s case and also Mandy ’s . Mostly Mandy ’s , and the rumors attached to how she got out , and where the information came from . He does n’t want me to contact him until he has more information . ”
13706	13727	13728	13728	Lewis	10	“ If there ’s a snitch on the force that could be how the traffickers know we ’re onto them , ”
13731	13788	13728	13728	Lewis	10	“ It makes sense though , right ? They have to be able to transfer girls , Lewis . That does n’t come without a set of eyes everywhere . I need you to ask Mandy if there are any contacts within law enforcement , and more specifically how we can get them to out themselves . ”
13789	13794	13799	13799	Lewis	10	“ I ’ll ask . ”
13994	14019	14020	14020	she	13	“ So , I was thinking we could start this fun party with a quick dive into the pool . What do you think ? ”
14035	14044	14023	14023	She	13	“ Do you want to come and play ? ”
14056	14095	14051	14051	he	10	“ Okay , I get the sense that you ’re about to give bad news , but you know what ? This is our vacation together . That bad news is not allowed unless we have some fun . ”
14096	14102	14110	14110	She	13	“ We need to talk . ”
14103	14109	14110	14110	She	13	“ And it can wait . ”
14121	14136	14110	14110	She	13	“ Come on ! Have some fun ! Teach me how to have fun . ”
14149	14154	14146	14147	a goner	480	“ Fine , fun . ”
14155	14158	14159	14159	She	13	“ Yay . ”
14170	14181	14167	14167	her	13	“ Last one in the pool is a rotten egg . ”
14239	14243	14244	14244	he	10	“ Rotten egg , ”
14251	14265	14244	14244	he	10	“ That ’s not fair . You ’re not even in bathing trunks . ”
14266	14287	14288	14288	He	10	“ So ? They ’re still briefs , and they ’re like trunks . It ’s good enough for me . ”
14296	14299	14244	14244	he	10	“ trunks . ”
14300	14304	14244	14244	he	10	“ You cheated . ”
14305	14323	14324	14324	She	13	“ Now you ’re creating rules because you do n’t like the fact you ’re a loser . ”
14336	14347	14324	14324	She	13	“ Is that the game you ’re going to play ? ”
14348	14352	14387	14387	he	10	“ You cheated . ”
14353	14379	14380	14380	She	13	“ I did not . You did n’t mention once that there were rules . Before calling rotten egg , you should have said so . ”
14457	14464	14446	14446	Lewis	10	“ I was only playing around . ”
14465	14479	14480	14480	His	10	“ I know . You could n’t stay angry with me for long . ”
14520	14527	14514	14514	She	13	“ You ’re a complete nut . ”
14528	14533	14534	14534	She	13	“ You love it . ”
14615	14622	14608	14608	he	10	“ You ’re going to burn . ”
14623	14640	14641	14641	She	13	“ I want to burn . I do n’t want to get out of the water . ”
14708	14714	14695	14695	she	13	“ I love the pool . ”
14715	14737	14769	14769	Lewis	10	“ I ’m glad . It ’s hot out , and I do n’t see it letting up for some time . ”
14738	14759	14779	14779	his	10	“ Nah , it probably wo n’t . That ’s the bonus of having a pool to cool off in . ”
14855	14864	14845	14845	her	13	“ What did you want to talk about ? ”
14865	14870	14902	14902	him	10	“ It can wait . ”
14871	14899	14902	14902	him	10	“ No . Please tell me . I do n’t want you to be burdened by this alone . I can help . I want to help . ”
14905	14950	14902	14902	him	10	“ Blake called . He spoke to our contact in law enforcement . Some people have been asking a lot of questions about Anna ’s case , but more about yours . He thinks someone is a snitch and is trying to find us . ”
14951	14956	14902	14902	him	10	“ Or find me . ”
14957	14968	14969	14969	She	13	“ Did they pay men to look the other way ? ”
14972	15007	14969	14969	She	13	“ Yes . Sometimes it was n’t money either . They ’d loan girls out to them for an agreed period of time . They , erm , they sometimes did n’t come back . ”
15008	15013	14902	14902	him	10	“ They killed them . ”
15017	15113	15014	15014	Mandy	13	“ They would … the agreement was that the girls they picked belonged to them . They could do with them as they wanted . Some of the men were violent , and they would beat the girls . Others did not . There ’s someone in every single town or city . It ’s a black market that pays a lot of money , but again it comes with risks . You get to find out people ’s weaknesses . If someone is asking questions , then they ’re probably working for the traffickers . ”
15114	15124	14969	14969	She	13	“ How do we find them ? Stop them ? ”
15125	15187	15218	15218	him	495	“ If they ’re paid with a girl , unless you have someone following them , you ca n’t get that information . The guys that I knew would pay with cash as well , which could be traced back . Especially if they were dumb enough to put a large sum in their bank , or even an offshore account . ”
15188	15197	15198	15198	he	495	“ Were you ever given to a cop ? ”
15209	15212	15213	15213	She	13	“ Yes . ”
15220	15226	15213	15213	She	13	“ Son of a bitch . ”
15253	15264	15235	15235	he	10	“ I ca n’t … I want to protect you . ”
15265	15271	15213	15213	She	13	“ You are protecting me . ”
15272	15333	15235	15235	he	10	“ No . I want to take everything that they did to you and fucking obliterate it . I do n’t want you to remember . I should have run harder . Fuck ! I should n’t have turned my back on you . I was watching you , and for a split second I was focused on something else . ”
15362	15372	15354	15354	she	13	“ What happened is not your fault , Lewis . ”
15373	15380	15354	15354	she	13	“ I should have saved you . ”
15381	15437	15438	15438	She	13	“ You did save me . I ’m right here . I ’m in front of you now , and we can work together to help others . You ’re not a monster . You ’re a wonderful , hardworking man . No one can ever take that away from you . You ’re amazing . ”
15445	15470	15438	15438	She	13	“ So amazing . I ca n’t even put into words what I think . You never gave up . You ’re a fighter . ”
15471	15475	15438	15438	She	13	“ Your memories . ”
15476	15515	15516	15516	She	13	“ They ’re my own , and not for you to think about . You gave me my freedom . Do n’t let me see you suffer for helping me . I could n’t bear to see that . ”
15596	15813	15814	15814	She	500	“ I was sitting at a dinner several years ago . A group of the guys who sold and dealt in girls were talking about the best way to ship girls and get cops to look the other way . They described the men that they were interested in . There were two types of men . The ones that had nothing , a bad reputation on the force , who would do anything for money . They were the best kinds to bring in for a quick fix to a problem . Most of the time they did n’t like working with them . They always betrayed you , and always went to the highest bidder . There ’s always someone around with more money who could buy them out . The people they loved were the ones with morals . Men who struggled with the decision to look the other way but were getting a bit on in years , and realized that their jobs were not going to give them a great retirement . The guys who had kids in college , were struggling , and could use the extra cash . They hated what they did but had no choice . In doing so , they had a lot more to lose . ”
15822	15854	15814	15814	She	500	“ Get your guy to look for those two kinds of men , then to look at them closely . See if they ’re the ones asking a lot of questions . ”
15897	15930	15884	15884	she	13	“ I do n’t want to do this . I ’ve got a wife , kids , grandkids . So much money , and I ca n’t earn that in a year . ”
16250	16254	16255	16255	Blake	24	“ Any news ? ”
16281	16306	16307	16307	He	15	“ Not a whole lot . I ’ve narrowed it down to ten possibilities . It depends on what you consider desperate , though . ”
16320	16345	16315	16315	Blake	24	“ A history of violence , the chance of a suspension without pay . Would that drive a man to look the other way ? ”
16346	16357	16358	16358	Blake	24	“ We ’re going to need to narrow this down , ”
16361	16372	16358	16358	Blake	24	“ Mandy was very specific . Two types of men . ”
16373	16402	16403	16403	He	15	“ I get that , but men do shit for different reasons . Desperation comes in many different forms , and can be for a variety of reasons . ”
16410	16415	16403	16403	He	15	“ Any other news ? ”
16416	16431	16432	16432	Jamie	15	“ There ’s been a call out for a woman meeting Mandy ’s description . ”
16446	16454	16436	16436	He	15	“ What kind of a call out ? ”
16455	16484	16485	16485	Blake	24	“ Someone has put a reward for Mandy to be delivered dead or alive . Once they have her , you ’re given an address to deliver her , ”
16488	16495	16485	16485	Blake	24	“ Lewis does n’t know this ? ”
16496	16583	16436	16436	He	15	“ No , and I do n’t want to warn him either . This has consumed his life . All he ’s wanted is to get that girl safe , and I ca n’t say that I blame him . We ca n’t even imagine what she went through , and you know what , I do n’t want to . What I want to do is put the bastards to ground that still pose a risk to her . The reward is for five million . ”
16584	16593	16485	16485	Blake	24	“ Holy shit . That ’s fucking high . ”
16594	16647	16485	16485	Blake	24	“ Because she knows shit , and has been helping us . We ’ve got to keep her safe . Everyone but Lewis knows . Providing they stay on that island , they ’ll be safe . No one knows where they are , and I want to keep it that way . ”
16648	16655	16656	16656	Jamie	15	“ What if they find out ? ”
16705	16764	16765	16765	Blake	24	“ They better not . We ’ve got a job to do . Russ wants Lewis to have a break . We all know he wo n’t take one if he feels there ’s a threat . He ’ll do the work here , and try to keep an eye on Mandy . He ca n’t do everything , ”
16803	16814	16815	16815	Elijah	32	“ There ’s no sign of her anywhere , sir . ”
17326	17336	17321	17321	Mandy	13	“ It ’s supposed to be romantic and sweet . ”
17337	17352	17321	17321	Mandy	13	“ It ’s boring . How can you read that stuff and not laugh ? ”
17353	17366	17321	17321	Mandy	13	“ Because I like poetry . I find that it relaxes me . ”
17367	17394	17395	17395	She	13	“ It ’s a bunch of bull that a lot of real old guys wrote to help get a girl into bed . It ’s dull . ”
17403	17414	17395	17395	She	13	“ You ’re just not opening your mind to it . ”
17429	17438	17415	17415	He	32	“ What do n’t you like about it ? ”
17439	17459	17395	17395	She	13	“ It ’s boring . I mean seriously , it does n’t even rhyme , and all poetry should . ”
17460	17469	17470	17470	He	32	“ There is just no pleasing some women . ”
17485	17492	17470	17470	He	32	“ What do you like then ? ”
17493	17512	17513	17513	He	32	“ I do n’t know . I like reading a good book with a great deal of romance . ”
17516	17551	17552	17552	She	13	“ You can snort all you want to . There ’s nothing wrong with reading romance . I love it , and you ’ve just got to ‘ open your mind to it . ’ ”
17562	17571	17559	17559	Lewis	10	“ Then I ’ll give it a try . ”
17572	17577	17578	17578	She	13	“ You really should . ”
17586	17591	17578	17578	She	13	“ This is nice . ”
17592	17609	17559	17559	Lewis	10	“ It is . I ’ve not known peace and quiet like this in some time . ”
17700	17708	17698	17698	Mandy	13	“ What are you thinking right now ? ”
17709	17736	17771	17771	She	13	“ That I love being here with you . I miss the club and work . It ’s rather strange some of the things you miss . ”
17737	17770	17771	17771	She	13	“ I know . I actually miss heading to college . Sitting in class , listening to him talk about everything and nothing . It ’s relaxing in a really weird way . ”
17786	17796	17771	17771	She	13	“ Please tell me you ’re at least relaxing . ”
17797	17807	17771	17771	She	13	“ I ’m relaxing . How could I not ? ”
17924	17937	17916	17916	her	13	“ I want you to relax . The guys do as well . ”
17968	17975	17964	17964	he	32	“ Tell me about the club . ”
17976	17981	17916	17916	her	13	“ The Billionaire Bikers ? ”
17982	17993	18002	18002	he	32	“ Yes . Talk to me , tell me everything . ”
17994	18001	18002	18002	he	32	“ I ’ve already done that , ”
18005	18017	18002	18002	he	32	“ Do it again . I want to hear absolutely everything . ”
18216	18482	18204	18204	He	10	“ I ’d become friends with Russ first . We had seen this club rolling through the city , and both of us loved our bikes , and he knew that I was trying to find you . It was the Chaos Bleeds crew , and this was a few years back . They just rode without a care in the world . After a time , we found other men of similar wealth , and with similar backgrounds . Most of them came from nothing . They knew about my family , and I told them about my wish . About helping women that had been taken , and after we ’d been formed for a couple of months , and we ’d enjoyed our fun and fleshed out the club , I told them about you . They wanted to help . Our wealth combined was out of this world . Most of them had come from the streets , the foster system . We ’d all been pushed to one side , and tried to be manipulated at some point in our lives . Now , we wanted to stop those who would do that . Who ’d silence the weak and the innocent . To a couple of the guys in the club they ’d say it was just about getting the women , or riding the bike , or having a lot of fun with the title MC . They love screwing with other men , and I have to say I find it a lot of fun as well . ”
18488	18560	18485	18485	her	561	“ We ’re not your bare - knuckle fighters on the streets . We do n’t even want to take credit for what we ’ve done . All we want to do is help people , and to do that , we have to be on the front line for it all . We have to get our hands dirty , and not one of us is afraid of doing that . ”
18595	18603	18604	18604	he	562	“ Why do you love hearing that ? ”
18607	18675	18604	18604	he	562	“ It fills me with hope , Lewis . That maybe when you ’re listening to what you say , you ’ll see all the fantastic things that you ’ve done . You ’re not a monster . You ’re not like those men who took us . You ca n’t save them all , but those that you can save , it makes you a hero . ”
18676	18683	18684	18684	She	564	“ I ’m not a hero . ”
18687	18813	18684	18684	She	564	“ The men who fought in battle , who come home with medals . Do you think they would rather have their fallen instead ? The one thing I ’ve learned from my life experience is that you ca n’t save them all . You can try , and you can blame yourself so easily . But there are those that do n’t blame you . There are women and girls tonight sitting at home , in the comfort and safety of that home , thinking of you and your club . The people who did n’t give up on them . To be a fighter in this world , Lewis , you need to see the good that you ’re doing . Nothing else . ”
18901	18910	18896	18896	She	13	“ I ’m going to head to bed . ”
20044	20047	20048	20048	Lewis	10	“ Checkmate , ”
20063	20068	20054	20054	Mandy	13	“ Chess is lame . ”
20113	20122	20123	20123	She	13	“ What else would you like to play ? ”
20253	20265	20266	20266	she	13	“ I ’m going to take a swim in the pool , ”
20328	20336	20347	20347	he	10	“ Are you coming for a swim ? ”
20337	20346	20347	20347	he	10	“ I ’ll join you in a minute , ”
20474	20481	20482	20482	she	13	“ That water is so good , ”
20485	20495	20482	20482	she	13	“ Come on , champion , come on in . ”
20496	20503	20451	20451	She	13	“ I ’m a champion now ? ”
20504	20533	20451	20451	She	13	“ Every single game we ’ve played , you ’ve won . I ca n’t even win a game of cards . You ’re no fair at all . ”
20534	20546	20547	20547	He	10	“ You ’d like me to make it easy for you . ”
20569	20580	20563	20563	his	10	“ You ’d like me to give up the game ? ”
20581	20595	20596	20596	She	13	“ You ’ve been playing these games a lot longer than I have . ”
20605	20617	20596	20596	She	13	“ The least you could do is help a girl out . ”
20618	20636	20637	20637	he	10	“ You do n’t strike me as the kind of girl who likes to make things easy , ”
20640	20659	20637	20637	he	10	“ I love having things be easy , Lewis . Sometimes I like the simple things in life . ”
20720	20723	20724	20724	she	13	“ Gotcha , ”
20766	20782	20783	20783	He	10	“ If you wanted me in the pool all you had to do was ask . ”
20830	20839	20840	20840	she	13	“ Where would the fun be in that ? ”
20857	20878	20845	20845	her	13	“ You ’ve got to be careful who you play with , Mandy . Sometimes you risk playing with fire . ”
20890	20926	20884	20884	her	13	“ Sometimes , Lewis , I like playing with fire . It gets tiring being so lonely , so cold , and you need a little fire to warm you up from the inside out . ”
20935	20941	20942	20942	he	10	“ What do you mean ? ”
21186	21191	21192	21192	she	13	“ That was amazing , ”
21206	21211	21195	21195	She	13	“ You ’re sure ? ”
21212	21228	21229	21229	She	13	“ I ’m not fragile , Lewis . I wo n’t break at a kiss . ”
21235	21243	21244	21244	He	10	“ Do n’t think that I will . ”
21269	21299	21261	21261	he	10	“ When I ’m with you the entire world fades away , and I can imagine anything . You ’ve given me the freedom to do that , Lewis . ”
21311	21336	21300	21300	She	13	“ I really do hope you can see that . I ’m not going to break down and cry . I ’ve done that . ”
21449	21459	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ You ’re meant to be enjoying a break , ”
21463	21498	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ I am . It ’s all great and fun . What ’s going on ? You know we ’re here to protect Mandy . It ’s not supposed to be an actual break . ”
21499	21529	21431	21431	He	10	“ Technically it is . We all needed you to take a break . A dead club member would n’t be good for us . We ’d be weak . ”
21530	21538	21431	21431	He	10	“ Tell me where we ’re at . ”
21539	21551	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ We ’ve narrowed it down to ten men in total . ”
21552	21571	21572	21572	Jamie	15	“ Send me the details . I ’ll have a look and see if I can spot anything . ”
21575	21584	21572	21572	Jamie	15	“ You do n’t need to be here . ”
21585	21598	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ I need to do something . I ’m losing my mind . ”
21599	21621	21622	21622	Lewis	10	“ I doubt that . With Mandy there , I ’m sure you ’ve got a lot to keep you occupied . ”
21633	21640	21622	21622	Lewis	10	“ Can I ask you something ? ”
21641	21645	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ Go ahead . ”
21646	21660	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ Do you think it ’s right for me to … kiss her ? ”
21661	21674	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ Why would n’t it be ? She ’s of legal age . ”
21675	21690	21460	21460	Jamie	15	“ Everything she ’s gone through . I do n’t want to hurt her . ”
21720	21820	21821	21821	Jamie	15	“ She ’s been through a lot , but she ’s still a woman , Lewis . You were her first crush . Even you knew that , and then you rescued her . You ’re her hero , and you ca n’t hold what was done to her against her . I ’d let Mandy take the lead on this . Trust her . Know her . You ’ll know and understand her better than anyone else . Above all , trust your instincts . Not your fears . I ’ll email you the list with the details . ”
22174	22180	22181	22181	she	13	“ I enjoyed the kiss , ”
22198	22212	22193	22193	she	13	“ Actually , I loved the kiss . You do it really well . ”
22213	22239	22181	22181	she	13	“ I do n’t want you to think that you have to kiss me . That I ’m demanding it as some kind of reward . ”
22240	22250	22251	22251	she	13	“ I do n’t for a second believe that , ”
22254	22288	22251	22251	she	13	“ You ’re not like them , Lewis . I ’d never think you were . You ca n’t be . You ’re not taking something that I do n’t want to give . ”
22296	22304	22305	22305	he	10	“ What do you want , Mandy ? ”
22314	22358	22359	22359	She	13	“ I do n’t want you to be afraid to kiss me , or touch me . I want you to do that . I also do n’t want you to freak out over the littlest thing , if that is even possible . ”
22385	22417	22373	22373	she	13	“ When I ’m near , do you get attracted to me ? Or do you just see the girl who was taken ? Or the broken woman in the hospital ? ”
22418	22433	22439	22439	he	10	“ You ’ve never been broken . You ’re a fighter . A survivor . ”
22501	22538	22495	22499	A physical , desirable woman	616	“ I ’m attracted to you , Mandy . I wo n’t lie to you . I did find it uncomfortable . I do n’t want you to ever think that I ’m like those men . ”
22539	22568	22569	22569	She	617	“ There ’s no way you could ever be like that , Lewis . They are … monsters . You ’re not . You ’re a great man . ”
22578	22592	22593	22593	She	617	“ Let ’s move on to what has gotten you so wrapped up . ”
22641	22657	22658	22658	She	617	“ Jamie sent me a list of ten possible men who could be the leak . ”
22703	22710	22711	22711	he	10	“ Mandy , what is it ? ”
22714	22749	22711	22711	he	10	“ She ’s very well - behaved . I ’m shocked . I thought all the bitches here would have a little fire inside them . She ’s completely gone , is n’t she ? ”
22750	22765	22766	22766	Elijah	32	“ Mandy is my greatest accomplishment . I never want to part with her . ”
22794	22804	22774	22774	She	617	“ I wish I had a bitch like that . ”
22805	22820	22766	22766	Elijah	32	“ Your job is to make sure I can get more bitches like this . ”
22821	22826	22827	22827	she	617	“ It ’s him , ”
22929	22937	22938	22938	Lewis	10	“ What ’s going on , Mandy ? ”
22941	23020	22938	22938	Lewis	10	“ He ’s always been fantastic at making people look the other way . A shipment of girls was sent to the local force some time ago . He did n’t work where he does now . I was sure they ’d come and get them . They never did . I later found out that Robert had manipulated the facts , and they went to the wrong port . The girls were taken and never seen again . ”
23028	23044	23045	23045	She	623	“ I ’d let Jamie know he ’s the guy you need to talk to . ”
23321	23326	23305	23305	She	13	“ Does Jamie know ? ”
23327	23342	23378	23378	his	32	“ Yes , he knows , and he ’s going to deal with it . ”
23343	23359	23360	23360	she	13	“ If you take Robert out , it will bring … him straight to you , ”
23363	23371	23360	23360	she	13	“ Who will it bring , Mandy ? ”
23411	23446	23447	23447	Lewis	10	“ It ’ll bring Elijah to you . Anyone who ’s ever crossed him has ended up dead . He ’s the one who gave me the final sendoff that should have killed me . ”
23480	23537	23470	23470	She	13	“ He ’ll expect you to go after Robert . You ’ve got to make sure that Jamie does n’t do that . Make your contact aware of who he is , what he does . Let him know that if Robert is asking questions , he ’s got a good reason to be doing it . ”
23538	23549	23550	23550	She	13	“ We ’re going to handle this . I promise . ”
23558	23609	23552	23552	her	13	“ All he has ever known is taking young women . I was his greatest success , so that he said if it was n’t for all the heat that came with a kid disappearing , he ’d only snatch young girls and train them as good as I was . ”
23617	23658	23612	23612	his	10	“ I hated him , Lewis . I hated him more than anything else in the world . Every time I was with him , I ’d think about the different ways that I ’d hurt him or kill him . ”
23659	23677	23678	23678	She	13	“ He wo n’t hurt you , Mandy . I wo n’t let him get to you . ”
24059	24070	24071	24071	His	15	“ I ’m going to have my eye on you . ”
24093	24096	24097	24097	he	15	“ Yello , ”
24102	24168	24097	24097	he	15	“ Hi , Jamie , I do n’t know who to call . There ’s a , erm , cop here . He ’s gone into Lewis ’s office and would n’t listen to me when I told him he was n’t allowed . I ’m nervous . Could you come and help ? I know it ’s rude of me to call , but — ”
24169	24188	24222	24222	Lewis	10	“ I ’m on my way . Tell me , Cameron , did the guy say his name ? ”
24189	24193	24194	24194	Jamie	15	“ Robert Jones . ”
24321	24326	24327	24327	he	15	“ Hey , darling , ”
24334	24355	24327	24327	he	15	“ I do n’t like him . He keeps asking questions , and Lewis told me to never answer them . ”
24356	24373	24374	24374	He	15	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll handle this . Go and get yourself a coffee . ”
24393	24421	24380	24381	Robert Jones	34	“ You know , for a guy of the law , you ’re invading someone ’s right to privacy . You do n’t even have a warrant . ”
24453	24507	24508	24508	He	643	“ I should call a lawyer , and I think we ’ve got enough security footage to prove that you are just another cop who ’ll take the law into your own hands . I wonder what your boss will think of your face and his precinct being splashed across the evening news . ”
24539	24547	24525	24525	He	34	“ I ’m looking for Lewis Cox . ”
24548	24559	24525	24525	He	34	“ Ca n’t help you . He ’s on vacation . ”
24560	24592	24525	24525	He	34	“ I have some important questions regarding Mr. Cox ’s involvement with one of my cases . It ’s classified information , and I ca n’t discuss that with just anyone . ”
24593	24625	24525	24525	He	34	“ I ’ve not heard of Lewis being involved with anything . He ’s a guy who specializes in technology . You ’re going to have to check your sources again . ”
24626	24637	24525	24525	He	34	“ Have you ever heard of the Billionaire Bikers MC ? ”
24638	24646	24647	24647	Jamie	15	“ Sounds like a joke to me , ”
24650	24676	24647	24647	Jamie	15	“ I do n’t know when Lewis will be getting back , but I will certainly pass on the message that you ’ve been looking . ”
24677	24686	24687	24687	Jamie	15	“ Mandy , the girl ’s name is . ”
24692	24695	24687	24687	Jamie	15	“ And ? ”
24741	24767	24731	24731	you	34	“ She ’s an important part of the case . Her knowledge could help bring down men and stop them from hurting any more women . ”
24768	24827	24828	24828	Robert	34	“ Really . Okay , I ’m really going to have to make some noise if this is what my tax money is going to . You need some new training with how you deal with the big boys . Right now , you ’re being really vague about what you want and what you do n’t want . ”
24833	24845	24828	24828	Robert	34	“ I ’ve seen things your ass has n’t even seen . ”
24849	24856	24846	24846	Jamie	15	“ I ’m sure it has . ”
24857	24863	24828	24828	Robert	34	“ I ’ll be watching . ”
24864	24898	24899	24899	He	15	“ Good . I ’ll be sure to check and make sure that you ’re who you say you are . A good cop like yourself can only expect me to do that . ”
24977	24984	24985	24985	she	676	“ I did n’t say anything , ”
24988	24995	24985	24985	she	676	“ I know you did n’t . ”
24996	25001	24957	24957	he	15	“ Where is he ? ”
25002	25041	24985	24985	she	676	“ He ’s gone , but I would n’t put it past him to come back . I ’m going to set up shop at Lewis ’s desk here . I do n’t want you to be alone . ”
25042	25048	24985	24985	she	676	“ I ’ll be fine . ”
25049	25062	24957	24957	he	15	“ I ’m also going to be escorting you home as well . ”
25063	25072	24985	24985	she	676	“ You do n’t need to do that . ”
25083	25108	25073	25073	Jamie	15	“ I know some things about that man that you ’re not going to like . I ca n’t tell you what they are . ”
25109	25118	25119	25119	He	15	“ Is this about the Billionaire Bikers MC ? ”
25126	25134	25119	25119	He	15	“ How do you know about that ? ”
25135	25180	25073	25073	Jamie	15	“ Lewis came here one night . I was working late , and he needed something . He had on his leather jacket . I do n’t even think he saw me here working . I saw it . I ’ve not told anyone . ”
25181	25193	25194	25194	She	676	“ Please do n’t . We ’re trying to help people . ”
25197	25202	25194	25194	She	676	“ He ’s bad ? ”
25203	25220	25073	25073	Jamie	15	“ Yes . He ’s bad . Do n’t worry though . I ’ll protect you . ”
25221	25239	25240	25240	He	677	“ You ’re a good person , and Lewis is lucky to have you as his friend . ”
25268	25276	25262	25262	He	677	“ Go on a date with me . ”
25277	25284	25073	25073	Jamie	15	“ You know I ca n’t . ”
25285	25310	25073	25073	Jamie	15	“ Is this about your kid ? If so , I ’m great with kids . I love kids . He ’ll love me . ”
25311	25348	25349	25349	She	676	“ He ’s been through a lot right now , and I do n’t want to confuse him any more than he has been . I really do appreciate it , but he must come first . ”
25363	25380	25381	25381	he	15	“ You ’re a woman as well as being a mother . Do n’t forget that , ”
25603	25608	25609	25609	She	13	“ Could n’t sleep ? ”
25619	25639	25613	25613	Lewis	10	“ It looks like I was n’t the only one who could n’t sleep . Did I wake you ? ”
25640	25648	25649	25649	Lewis	10	“ I ’ve not been to sleep . ”
25656	25671	25649	25649	Lewis	10	“ I ’m just thinking about you , and what you said to me . ”
25672	25698	25699	25699	She	13	“ I ’ve said a great deal to you . You ’re going to need to help me out here on what I ’ve said . ”
25704	25708	25699	25699	She	13	“ Our kiss . ”
25714	25725	25711	25711	her	13	“ Have I gotten underneath that tough skin of yours ? ”
25726	25747	25748	25748	She	13	“ It ’s not hard to do . There ’s always been a special place for you in my heart . ”
25776	25783	25768	25768	she	13	“ What about what I said ? ”
25784	25801	25822	25822	him	10	“ I do n’t want you to ever think I want something like that from you . ”
25802	25819	25820	25820	She	13	“ I know that , Lewis . You have nothing to worry about in that regard . ”
25840	25847	25830	25830	he	10	“ You can tell me anything . ”
25848	25873	25822	25822	him	10	“ I enjoyed that kiss . I find you attractive . I ’m hard right now just thinking about you naked , underneath me . ”
25874	25881	25882	25882	she	13	“ Is that a bad thing ? ”
25891	25894	25822	25822	him	10	“ Yes ! ”
25904	25907	25822	25822	him	10	“ Oh . ”
25908	25999	25822	25822	him	10	“ Ugh , it ’s not like that . I ’m torn , okay ? I ’ve spent all this time looking for you . Hunting for you . I made a vow to bring you home . I did that , and now you ’re here . You ’re back in my life , and not a day goes by that I do n’t think about you . I want to share everything with you . To get you to experience the life that was once taken from you . ”
26000	26022	26023	26023	She	684	“ I just want to share my life with you , Lewis . I do n’t need anything else but that . ”
26027	26043	26044	26044	She	684	“ I know you ’re not like those people , Lewis . I want you . ”
26203	26232	26233	26233	He	685	“ I ’m not going to break . I ’m yours , Lewis . All you have to do is say the words and I ’m all yours . ”
26329	26334	26324	26324	he	685	“ Say that again . ”
26335	26339	26324	26324	he	685	“ Which part ? ”
26352	26360	26324	26324	he	685	“ The part about you being mine . ”
26361	26373	26324	26324	he	685	“ I ’m yours , Lewis . Do you want me ? ”
26374	26420	26421	26421	He	685	“ I ca n’t even believe that you have to ask that . Want you ? I fucking crave you . I ’ve wanted you for a long time now , and being near you only drives the need inside me a little more crazy . ”
26650	26656	26657	26657	she	684	“ That feels so good , ”
26676	26685	26686	26686	he	685	“ Are you wet for me , babe ? ”
26689	26692	26686	26686	he	685	“ Yes . ”
26693	26699	26700	26700	She	684	“ I want to feel . ”
26737	26757	26733	26733	they	688	“ I ’ve been thinking about you for a long time , Lewis . I want you so much . ”
26831	26837	26838	26838	she	684	“ You ’re so big , ”
26980	27017	27018	27018	She	684	“ You ’re going to come all over my fingers , baby . You ’re going to scream my name , beg for more , and I ’m going to take whatever you can give me . ”
27040	27049	27034	27034	he	10	“ Who do you belong to , Mandy ? ”
27050	27058	27121	27121	He	10	“ You , Lewis . Always you . ”
27059	27072	27121	27121	He	10	“ That ’s right . Tell me how much you want this . ”
27073	27078	27034	27034	he	10	“ I want you . ”
27079	27088	27089	27089	he	10	“ You want me to touch your pussy ? ”
27092	27095	27089	27089	he	10	“ Yes . ”
27096	27105	27034	27034	he	10	“ You want me to make you come ? ”
27106	27109	27034	27034	he	10	“ Yes . ”
27110	27120	27121	27121	He	10	“ That ’s a lot of things to want . ”
27135	27153	27160	27160	he	10	“ I do n’t mind because I want to be the man to give you those things . ”
27248	27255	27256	27256	she	690	“ Please , do n’t stop , ”
27509	27519	27520	27520	she	690	“ I want you to fuck me , Lewis , ”
27523	27531	27520	27520	she	690	“ Do n’t hold back , either . ”
27691	27698	27699	27699	she	13	“ I do n’t need romance , ”
27712	27724	27699	27699	she	13	“ You may not need it , but I want it . ”
27782	27788	27789	27789	Lewis	10	“ You ’re so beautiful . ”
27835	27884	27885	27885	He	10	“ There ’s going to be time for that soon . I ’m going to take my time with you , Mandy . Make this moment last for a lifetime . I ’m going to make love to you , and show you how much I cherish you . ”
28189	28198	28199	28199	he	10	“ Are you not used to being cherished ? ”
28202	28231	28199	28199	he	10	“ There ’s no rush , and I ’m not just going to climb on top and start thrusting . I ’m going to take my sweet time . ”
28246	28255	28232	28232	He	10	“ Your body was made to be cherished . ”
28256	28271	28272	28272	He	10	“ I ’m going to burn up if you do n’t touch me soon . ”
28300	28310	28311	28311	She	690	“ I ’m not going to fuck you yet . ”
28314	28337	28311	28311	She	690	“ When I ’m good and ready , you ’ll feel my cock inside you , and not a moment too soon . ”
28338	28353	28392	28392	he	10	“ I ’m not going to be able to cope with all this torture . ”
28354	28367	28368	28368	He	10	“ It ’s torture being with me ? Having your body loved ? ”
28627	28634	28635	28635	he	10	“ You taste so fucking good , ”
28688	28700	28701	28701	he	10	“ I want you to come in my mouth , baby , ”
28957	28962	28963	28963	he	10	“ You feel amazing , ”
28966	28997	28963	28963	he	10	“ I ’m not going to fuck you tonight . I ’m going to make love to you , Mandy . You ’re going to know who you belong to . ”
29232	29241	29242	29242	he	10	“ Fuck , Mandy , I love you , ”
29245	29253	29242	29242	he	10	“ I love you so damn much . ”
29293	29304	29277	29277	Lewis	10	“ I ’m never going to get enough of you . ”
29305	29313	29277	29277	Lewis	10	“ I will hold you to that . ”
29327	29333	29334	29334	he	10	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
29354	29360	29348	29348	she	13	“ Did I hurt you ? ”
29380	29392	29393	29393	she	13	“ That was the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced , ”
29400	29430	29393	29393	she	13	“ I … I loved it , Lewis . I love you so much , and what we just had , it is the best feeling of my life . ”

31001	31007	30956	30956	He	10	“ What on earth for ? ”
31008	31025	31026	31026	He	10	“ I ’ve figured out what I want to do with the rest of my day . ”
31051	31067	31048	31048	he	10	“ I ’m going to make love to you for the rest of this day . ”
31068	31072	31122	31122	her	13	“ Make love ? ”
31073	31094	31122	31122	her	13	“ We ’re going to fuck and make love . Eat , shower , and do it all over again . ”
31095	31101	31048	31048	he	10	“ You ’ve just come . ”
31102	31118	31119	31119	She	13	“ Give me a couple of minutes and I ’ll do it all over again . ”
31138	31150	31151	31151	she	13	“ We ’re going to have to go back home soon , ”
31154	31169	31151	31151	she	13	“ I know . When we get home I want you to marry me . ”
31177	31180	31172	31172	he	10	“ Marry ? ”
31181	31220	31151	31151	she	13	“ Yes . We ’ve got a lot of wants going around . I figured I ’d throw that one out for you to get used to . Also , there wo n’t be a pre - nup . ”
31221	31239	31172	31172	he	10	“ Now that is completely crazy . You ’re rich beyond anything , and I ’m broke . ”
31240	31248	31172	31172	he	10	“ I ’m rich because of you . ”
31254	31262	31249	31249	She	13	“ No , that was all you . ”
31274	31334	31263	31263	He	10	“ It was all you . If I had n’t wanted to find you , I ’d not have started the company . It ’s half yours . Besides , I ’m going to make sure that you ’re never going to divorce me . I ’ll keep you happy and in love for the rest of our days . ”
31335	31348	31349	31349	she	13	“ What about if you realize that you do n’t want me ? ”
31352	31360	31349	31349	she	13	“ That ’s never going to happen . ”
31361	31368	31263	31263	He	10	“ How can you know that ? ”
31369	31425	31349	31349	she	13	“ These feelings I have for you , Mandy , they ’re not something that can go away quickly . It has been you for so long , I ca n’t even think straight . I love you , Mandy . No one else . I would fight for you , and die for you . ”
31434	31445	31349	31349	she	13	“ I do n’t want you to cry , baby . ”
31446	31455	31263	31263	He	10	“ You ’re asking me to marry you . ”
31456	31471	31263	31263	He	10	“ Yeah , I am . I can do that , ca n’t I ? ”
31472	31488	31349	31349	she	13	“ I do n’t know . I think I ’m in shock at the moment . ”
31489	31500	31501	31501	he	708	“ You have a way of keeping a guy hanging , ”
31504	31514	31515	31515	she	13	“ You ’re sure you want to marry me ? ”
31518	31543	31515	31515	she	13	“ More than sure . I love you , Mandy . I ’m not going to marry anyone else . Do you love me ? ”
31544	31549	31349	31349	she	13	“ More than anything . ”
31550	31561	31562	31562	He	708	“ Then you know what you ’ve got to say . ”
31575	31586	31562	31562	He	708	“ Put me out of my misery and say yes . ”
31587	31590	31349	31349	she	13	“ Yes . ”
32127	32137	32138	32138	Lewis	10	“ I thought I ’d find you down here , ”
32150	32170	32171	32171	He	10	“ I love being here . It ’s relaxing , and I can almost forget why we ’re here . ”
32183	32214	32171	32171	He	10	“ I ’ve not spent much time here , to be honest . I ’ve had more conversations in the past few weeks with Cynthia than I ’ve ever had . ”
32215	32222	32223	32223	she	741	“ What does the club say ? ”
32276	32283	32284	32284	Mandy	13	“ Nothing . All is quiet . ”
32330	32338	32339	32339	she	13	“ We ’ve got to go back , ”
32342	32350	32339	32339	she	13	“ Not yet , we do n’t . ”
32351	32430	32431	32431	He	10	“ You and I both know that nothing is going to happen while we ’re here . The women are safe for now , but can you stay here indefinitely ? As much as your work was made because of me , you ’re still needed . I ’ve heard you on the phone , pacing , trying to resolve matters while you ’re thousands of miles away . You ca n’t keep up that kind of sacrifice . ”
32434	32450	32431	32431	He	10	“ I will continue to do what I need while I know you ’re safe . ”
32451	32483	32339	32339	she	13	“ I ’m not going to be safe until we find the two men hunting me down . Maybe going home , talking about our upcoming nuptials will lure them out . ”
32484	32493	32339	32339	she	13	“ I ’m not using you as bait . ”
32494	32505	32431	32431	He	10	“ I ’ll be heavily guarded . It ’s you . ”
32517	32565	32506	32506	She	750	“ I know there ’s not going to be a chance in hell of those monsters getting to me . I can split my time between each of the Billionaires , Lewis . You ’ll be happy then , and you ’ll know that I ’m safe . ”
32574	32584	32566	32566	He	10	“ You make it difficult to argue with you . ”
32585	32648	32566	32566	He	10	“ That ’s because you know I ’m right about this . You ’re needed back at home , and we ca n’t live here forever . Winter will be here before we know it , and then Cynthia ’s visits are only when the ocean is calm . I do n’t want to risk anyone else ’s life because of mine . ”
32649	32654	32655	32655	he	10	“ Kiss me again , ”
32702	32711	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ I want to say no to you . ”
32712	32724	32725	32725	He	10	“ But you ca n’t . You know I speak sense . ”
32728	32753	32725	32725	He	10	“ The rest of the guys are in agreement with you . We ’ve tried it this way , and it ’s not worked . ”
32754	32762	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ What were you hoping would happen ? ”
32763	32783	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ That we ’d get lucky . Those assholes would show themselves , and then we could go home . ”
32784	32841	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ They ’ve been doing this a long time . They know the drill . When the heat starts on them , they either move town , or wait for it to die down . The city is a good place for them though . I would n’t be surprised if women were n’t already gone . ”
32842	32845	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ Why ? ”
32846	32970	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ In the city , it ’s a big enough place for women to get lost . If there ’s a runaway or a kid in the foster system , often someone does n’t report them missing and just assumes they ’ll turn up . Time starts to pass , and before they even realize their mistake , the kid ’s long gone , sold , and they ’ve moved onto the next person . Then of course there are the prostitutes that walk the street at night . No one is going to report them as missing . What you need to realize , Lewis , is if they can find someone , they will . They can operate under the radar . ”
32971	32978	32979	32979	She	751	“ I do n’t like it . ”
32988	33000	32979	32979	She	751	“ Do n’t . Do n’t beat yourself up about this . ”
33001	33008	32692	32692	Lewis	10	“ You were loved , Mandy . ”
33009	33013	33014	33014	She	751	“ I know . ”
33039	33045	33046	33046	He	752	“ Are we going home ? ”
33053	33062	33063	33063	She	751	“ I want to keep you safe forever . ”
33066	33081	33063	33063	She	751	“ You will . I love you , Lewis . I believe in you . ”
33082	33093	33048	33048	his	752	“ I ’m not going to use you as bait . ”
33094	33115	33116	33116	He	752	“ I guess the other guys have come up with a similar solution . Using me to get to them . ”
33125	33161	33116	33116	He	752	“ They think if you start to make an appearance by my side , and with our wedding , it could lure them out . We ’ll all be ready for anything that would happen . ”
33216	33252	33203	33203	She	751	“ We ’ve got to go back . You know what they say is right . The only way we can carry on is if we allow the rest of the world to see us . ”
33253	33287	33288	33288	She	751	“ We ’ll go back , but I ’m not letting you out of my sight . I do n’t give a fuck what anyone else says . That is what I say . ”
33291	33299	33288	33288	She	751	“ Have you already organized our return ? ”
33300	33320	33203	33203	She	751	“ Yes . It was why I came to get you . I can cancel it at any time . ”
33321	33345	33346	33346	He	755	“ We ca n’t . This is it , Lewis . I guess in a way it ’s our final stand against them . ”
33387	33437	33438	33438	Jamie	15	“ ‘ Billionaire Lewis Cox just recently announced his engagement . No one knows much of the woman in question , other than her name is Mandy Watson , but it is sure to be the event of the year as everyone waits for this love to blossom , ’ ”
33528	33537	33538	33538	Blake	24	“ It ’s not all fun , though , ”
33541	33568	33538	33538	Blake	24	“ One of the newspapers has called her a gold - digger , and has even started a bet on how long your marriage will last . ”
33569	33580	33581	33581	Lewis	10	“ I do n’t give a fuck what they think , ”
33584	33613	33614	33614	Russ	11	“ The marriage is real , then ? I know you ’ve been in love with her , but I did n’t know it had moved that far , ”
33617	33630	33614	33614	Russ	11	“ I ’ve been out of the loop for a little while . ”
33631	33651	33538	33538	Blake	24	“ Mandy ’s the love of my life . I asked her to marry me , and she agreed . ”
33669	33691	33692	33692	Mandy	13	“ He ’s going to be doing a pre - nup , though . I ’ve told him to do that , ”
33695	33704	33692	33692	Mandy	13	“ I told you it ’s not happening . ”
33705	33715	33716	33716	Jamie	15	“ That ’s going to cause a major stir , ”
33719	33776	33716	33716	Jamie	15	“ I like this . Are you going to the charity event next week ? It ’s for disadvantaged children . It can be the first real photo opportunity for your girl here . We can have her dressed up in the finest , and then we can showcase her to the world as your bride . ”
33777	33805	33806	33806	Lewis	10	“ I hate doing that shit . You know I always arrive around the back of the charity , and leave without anyone catching sight of me , ”
33809	33853	33854	33854	John	20	“ Yeah , but this is your chance to really get in there and show the world that you mean business . A couple of shots of the two of you together , smiling at each other , it ’ll sell the story , ”
33857	33863	33864	33864	she	761	“ That could really work , ”
33867	33939	33864	33864	she	761	“ He thinks I ’m his property . Elijah , the man Robert works for . He thinks that by rights I ’m all his . I was his biggest success , and his biggest mistake . I know things that terrify him . I know how he works . Seeing me on the arm of a rich billionaire , and if you touch me , it could draw him out . ”
33970	33979	33980	33980	Lewis	10	“ You ’ve all got to be there , ”
33983	34032	33980	33980	Lewis	10	“ I ’m not going to an event unless I ’m one hundred percent sure that she ’s safe . I wo n’t risk it . This marriage will be real . Mandy is the love of my life , and I ’m claiming her as my own . ”
34033	34064	34065	34065	Russ	11	“ Another old lady into the mix . Anna and Temperance will be pleased . They ca n’t wait until all of you have fallen in love with your women , ”
34126	34168	34169	34169	Blake	24	“ So , first we need a kick - ass dress for the charity gala . Then we ’ve got to have a few outfits for outings . You know , dates . You ’ve got to go public with this , ”
34172	34184	34185	34185	Sean	23	“ He ’s right . The entire world will be watching , ”
34188	34198	34185	34185	Sean	23	“ I ’m a businessman , not a celebrity . ”
34212	34239	34240	34240	Russ	11	“ You ’re a billionaire about to get hitched . In this day and age , that means something . A bachelor taken off the market , ”
34243	34262	34240	34240	Russ	11	“ It ’ll happen for every single one of us . You ’ve just got to see that . ”
34263	34269	34270	34270	Lewis	10	“ What about the club ? ”
34312	34348	34349	34349	Dave	22	“ Until our enemies are gone , I say we work like this for now . Sticking to secret meetings . Working together to bring them out . Mandy and Anna have to be safe , ”
34352	34365	34349	34349	Dave	22	“ We ca n’t let our enemies get a hold of them . ”
34366	34383	34384	34384	Lewis	10	“ I bet it ’s not like this for any of the other MCs out there , ”
34437	34445	34446	34446	Jamie	15	“ We ’re not like other MCs , ”
34449	34501	34446	34446	Jamie	15	“ This is what we agreed to . We do n’t put ourselves or anyone at risk . Mandy is the biggest risk , and she ’s our best asset for the club . Using your relationship , we ’re hoping it ’ll drive this guy crazy and draw him out . ”
34528	34549	34550	34550	Mandy	13	“ Do you find it weird that I ’ve got two men to dress me rather than the two women ? ”
34575	34583	34584	34584	she	13	“ Everything is going to be fine , ”
34587	34595	34584	34584	she	13	“ You ’re worrying way too much . ”
34596	34623	34624	34624	He	10	“ Anna and Temperance are not good enough when it comes to fashion . Blake and Jamie know their stuff , and can get it together . ”
34640	34647	34632	34632	she	13	“ I know you ’re worried . ”
34648	34654	34584	34584	she	13	“ Would n’t you be ? ”
34655	34666	34667	34667	she	13	“ You ’ve never been in the public eye before ? ”
34670	34719	34720	34720	She	13	“ No . I ’m a businessman . I had other commitments . Pandering to the fucked - up needs of the media has never appealed to me . I donate to charity , keep lots of men and women in a job . I do my bit . ”
34730	34756	34720	34720	She	13	“ I ’ll be there with you . At least you ’ve got nothing in your past to hide . I ’ve got a lot . ”
34757	34780	34720	34720	She	13	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ve made sure your past will stay hidden . I would never subject you to that . ”
34781	34790	34720	34720	She	13	“ You ’re a good man , Lewis . ”
34791	34845	34846	34846	She	775	“ I ’m surprised you ’re not kicking my ass with what ’s about to happen . You know Jamie and Blake wo n’t stop at the clothes . You ’re going to be primped , pampered , and tortured beyond your wildest dreams , all in the name of looking the part . ”
34856	34882	34846	34846	She	775	“ I ’ll do it for you . I ’m not into the whole being tugged and pulled about . I can handle everything else . ”
34903	34914	34892	34892	Lewis	10	“ You ’re thinking again . You look really sad . ”
34915	34930	34931	34931	He	776	“ I wish we could ’ve stayed on the island for a little longer . ”
34944	35092	35093	35093	She	779	“ I dreamed of an island like that whenever life got a little too hard . My imagination was the only thing holding me together . I ’d think about being alone , or free to walk down a beach and stare out at the vast ocean . One of the journeys we took was via a boat or something . I think it was a small yacht . I hated the water . The ocean was spread out for days . I wondered if there were sharks in the water , and if I just jumped overboard , would it even matter . Before I got a chance to climb over the edge , they pulled me back on board . I was locked up for the rest of the journey , and I prayed for us to be shipwrecked . How messed up is that ? ”
35098	35110	35093	35093	She	779	“ I do n’t know why I just told you that . ”
35111	35135	35093	35093	She	779	“ There were moments during my search that I thought I was getting close to you . That I could feel you near . ”
35136	35219	35093	35093	She	779	“ I think we were close to each other at a couple of times . Probably missed each other by a matter of minutes . You ’ve got me now , Lewis . I ’m not going anywhere . I wo n’t jump into the ocean in the hope of being eaten . I know you hate this , and what you ’ve got to do , but you ’re not alone . I ’ll be with you , by your side . ”
35220	35226	35093	35093	She	779	“ Are n’t you afraid ? ”
35227	35256	35093	35093	She	779	“ Terrified . I do n’t want anything to happen to you . I love you more than my own life . You mean the world to me . ”
35263	35286	35257	35257	She	781	“ I can do whatever you want . All you ’ve got to do is ask , and I ’ll be there . ”
35287	35299	35300	35300	He	782	“ You wo n’t be alone , baby . I promise . ”
35370	35379	35380	35380	Mandy	13	“ You ’re torturing me on purpose now , ”
35426	35433	35422	35422	they	784	“ I ’m not wearing this . ”
35434	35464	35465	35465	Blake	24	“ We know you ’re not , but it was so funny to see if we could get you into it . I totally win , by the way , ”
35478	35496	35471	35471	Jamie	15	“ You ’ve got to be kidding me . How could you bet on something like this ? ”
35497	35541	35542	35542	She	781	“ Quite easily . Do n’t worry , darling . You do n’t have to wear that . I told Jamie we ’d get you into it , but he said that we ’d not be able to do that . I win . ”
35672	35678	35665	35665	she	781	“ What do you think ? ”
35695	35700	35701	35701	Jamie	15	“ That is beautiful , ”
35704	35709	35701	35701	Jamie	15	“ You look stunning . ”
35710	35716	35717	35717	Blake	24	“ That ’s the dress , ”
35736	35740	35722	35722	They	785	“ Lewis agrees . ”
35741	35754	35701	35701	Jamie	15	“ You ’ve been giving him a little view of the dresses ? ”
35755	35763	35764	35764	Jamie	15	“ It ’s his right to look , ”
35767	35774	35764	35764	Jamie	15	“ I ’ll package these up . ”
35818	35830	35831	35831	she	781	“ So , erm , do you think this will work ? ”
35867	35884	35849	35849	she	781	“ We ’re hoping it will draw him out , or get him to make mistakes . ”
35885	35901	35902	35902	she	781	“ Have you been getting people to check out the local docks or abandoned warehouses ? ”
35909	35918	35919	35919	Jamie	15	“ We ’ve had everything triple - checked . ”
35923	35939	35919	35919	Jamie	15	“ Lewis purchased all the available warehouses . There ’s nothing in the surrounding city . ”
35940	35963	35964	35964	Mandy	13	“ I do n’t want anything to happen to him . No matter what . He has to be taken care of . ”
36023	36033	36034	36034	Blake	24	“ I want to be serious for a moment , ”
36045	36059	36060	36060	She	13	“ There ’s a reason we want all of this to be public . ”
36072	36121	36060	36060	She	13	“ All of this could be done without the need for publicity . Lewis has dodged the press for years . We all have in our own way . Our names are always linked to some model or something . It ’s all rumor . No actual facts . ”
36122	36131	36034	36034	Blake	24	“ Okay , why are you doing this ? ”
36132	36178	36034	36034	Blake	24	“ You get seen in public . Your face becomes recognized . We ’re trying to do this for your added protection . You ’re just a woman who is marrying the love of her life . No one needs to be any the wiser . ”
36179	36196	36060	36060	She	13	“ The case was a huge one , Blake . We ca n’t hide that forever . ”
36197	36260	36261	36261	Blake	24	“ It ’s the case of a lifetime as well . Girl next door goes missing , and the guy of her dreams ca n’t give up . It can be spun any way we want . It ’s the value of having a lot of money . We can do what we want . I ’m already all over the press , ”
36264	36285	36261	36261	Blake	24	“ He owns one of the newspapers . It ’s why we can get certain things public and not others , ”
36361	36383	36415	36415	Blake	24	“ What is the end game in all of this ? Elijah and the men do n’t walk in our circle . ”
36384	36414	36415	36415	Blake	24	“ But they might . There ’s a reason this is an expensive business . We have reason to believe that they could be people we do business with . ”
36424	36478	36415	36415	Blake	24	“ We want two things from this . One , for you to be seen . In our minds that makes you well known . Public property , and not someone who is easily taken . Two , it will expose them . We ’ll get to see who we ’re up against . ”
36479	36490	36415	36415	Blake	24	“ Do you think they will come to the party ? ”
36491	36539	36540	36540	She	795	“ We know that our contact is going to be there , and so is Robert . There ’s a risk with this gala . So many big names , they ’ve got no choice but to up the law enforcement there in case anything goes wrong . ”
36546	36556	36540	36540	She	795	“ Does Lewis know everything that you ’re doing ? ”
36557	36600	36601	36601	Jamie	15	“ He knows some of it . He does n’t know that Robert Jones is going to be there . Lewis is n’t the best actor when he knows what is expected of him . The element of surprise will help us , ”
36604	36619	36601	36601	Jamie	15	“ So all I ’ve got to do is be seen and play nice . ”
36620	36628	36685	36685	Lewis	10	“ Should n’t be too hard now . ”
36629	36642	36643	36643	She	795	“ Of course not . It ’ll be a piece of cake . ”
36679	36684	36685	36685	Lewis	10	“ You ’re shaking , ”
36725	36749	36750	36750	She	795	“ It ’s all new , you know . The press . The lifestyle . It ’s all a little overwhelming at times . ”
36786	36802	36780	36780	he	10	“ I thought we had gotten rid of the men who had kept you trapped . ”
36803	36814	36815	36815	Their	797	“ Do you really want to talk about this now ? ”
36827	36841	36842	36842	She	795	“ It could help to relax you . Talk to me , Mandy . ”
36847	37088	36842	36842	She	795	“ There ’s always men trained to do certain things . Mostly they ’re like soldiers . They just keep an eye on the girls , and keep everything in order . There ’s always so many of them . They ’re more like guard dogs , to be honest . There to snap and bite if one of the women got away or had a little too much mouth on her . They keep the women in line . Then you have the men who train them . Some women are just sold . They work locally in brothels , or sent on the street . If you do n’t get there , you ’re sent to be trained . When you ’re trained this means you ’re put up for auction , and men all over the world can buy you . That ’s not all . They sometimes are sent lists from buyers of the kinds of women they like . A shopping list , if you will . All of this is dealt with by one man . The one who runs everything , who pays the money to the guard dogs . That was Elijah . He was the one who owned me . Elijah took me , trained me , owned every single part of me . I was n’t allowed to … be myself . I could n’t have anything or do anything . ”
37102	37127	37089	37089	She	799	“ He was the one who gave me the final beating . But he was n’t the one who threw me in the cage . ”
37128	37138	37139	37139	he	800	“ He ’s the monster you ’re afraid of ? ”
37142	37249	37139	37139	he	800	“ He took everything , and then he made me do things I ’m not proud of , Lewis . I ’ve never wanted to kill a man so much as I want to kill him . I know he ’s here . I know he ’s watching , and he ’s waiting . I can feel it . Robert ’s here , and he was always so loyal to him . I think it ’s why I do n’t hold much stock in the law or cops . They ’re easily swayed . Throw them some cash , and they ’ll look the other way . ”
37250	37266	37089	37089	She	799	“ They ’re not all like that , sweetheart . Some of them are good . ”
37267	37281	37282	37282	She	801	“ Yeah , well , I ’ve only ever known the shitty ones . ”
37290	37332	37282	37282	She	801	“ I ’m sorry . I thought being free would help me . That I ’d feel different . Right now , I feel more trapped than ever before . Even now when he ’s not near . He ’s controlling . ”
37341	37346	37347	37347	he	801	“ Feel any better ? ”
37350	37361	37347	37347	he	801	“ The truth ? Not really . Not at all . ”
37378	37391	37392	37392	He	801	“ Let ’s go and show them we can do this together . ”
37519	37529	37582	37582	she	808	“ Make sure you keep your arm around her . ”
37530	37540	37582	37582	she	808	“ Every chance you get , smile at her . ”
37541	37555	37582	37582	she	808	“ Let the world see that you ’re totally in love with her . ”
37556	37577	37578	37578	Cameron	17	“ If you love her , and she loves you , the world will fall in love with you both . ”
37783	37789	37790	37790	Mandy	13	“ We can do this , ”
37814	37821	37822	37822	he	15	“ You look dazzling , darling , ”
37828	37835	37825	37825	Mandy	13	“ You ’re crazy and insane . ”
37905	37916	37917	37917	Lewis	10	“ I think the feather dress would have been wonderful , ”
37926	37932	37933	37933	She	13	“ Do n’t be silly . ”
37941	37956	37935	37935	her	13	“ You ’d have never gotten me out of the apartment in that monstrosity . ”
37957	37973	37935	37935	her	13	“ I do n’t know . You ’d have been the talk of the night . ”
37974	37981	37982	37982	Jamie	15	“ For all the wrong reasons , ”
37985	38004	37982	37982	Jamie	15	“ Make sure you come to me for advice on what ’s worth wearing and what ’s not . ”
38005	38021	38022	38022	Lewis	10	“ Already noted . I do n’t think I could handle his kind of fashion . ”
38141	38167	38168	38168	Robert	34	“ Hello , Mr. Cox . We ’ve not been properly introduced . I ’ve got a few questions I ’d like to ask you , ”
38171	38209	38133	38133	she	13	“ I know of you , and I take great offense at having my private life invaded . This is a charity gala , and right now I do n’t need to be talking about such matters . ”
38210	38224	38225	38225	Lewis	10	“ It matters a great deal . It ’s about her , Mandy . ”
38244	38261	38240	38240	he	10	“ I need to deal with this … person . Would you entertain Mandy for me ? ”
38262	38265	38266	38266	Lewis	10	“ Certainly . ”
38319	38333	38291	38299	the man who had allowed women to be hurt	834	“ Are you a member of a club called the Billionaire Bikers MC ? ”
38334	38391	38400	38400	Robert	34	“ What a ridiculous thing to say . You know , I ’m curious if your boss is aware of your interference and general lack of social grace . We are at a charity gala , and I believe my office is private . All things that require a warrant , which you do not have . ”
38392	38399	38400	38400	Robert	34	“ Let ’s cut the bullshit , ”
38403	38454	38400	38400	Robert	34	“ You know who I am , and I know who you are . You ’re not just some rich businessman doing this for kicks . You ’re the guy that went looking for her . The one that would n’t give up no matter what warnings you were given . ”
38511	38538	38507	38507	He	10	“ You ’re not dealing with a teenage boy completely filled with guilt . You ’re dealing with a man who knows what he ’s about . ”
38539	38559	38560	38560	Lewis	10	“ You ’re not going to win . That bitch belongs to my boss . He will have her . ”
38620	38633	38634	38634	Lewis	10	“ Why do n’t you tell your boss to bring it on ? ”
38637	38665	38666	38666	He	10	“ Let ’s see how he can handle a man rather than a defenseless woman . Tell him to stop being a coward and face me himself . ”
38669	38675	38666	38666	He	10	“ Good talking with you . ”
38862	38867	38868	38868	Elijah	32	“ You look fantastic , ”
38876	38899	38900	38900	She	13	“ I was never able to mark that pretty back of yours . That was something I did n’t think was necessary . ”
38916	38926	38900	38900	She	13	“ I should have known you ’d show up . ”
38927	38933	38934	38934	he	848	“ How could I not ? ”
39054	39078	39079	39079	He	32	“ I thought you were dead , and now I hear that you ’re engaged to be married to a very wealthy man . ”
39082	39092	39079	39079	He	32	“ I clearly did n’t train you well enough . ”
39132	39203	39125	39125	He	32	“ You know , one of the trainers we have , he took one look at you and said you were n’t trained at all . That I had failed and there was a fire that would n’t go until you died . I told him that he was wrong . That I could have you do anything I wanted , and I showed him , right ? You remember ? ”
39289	39297	39298	39298	he	856	“ You will be mine once again , ”
39301	39375	39298	39298	he	856	“ Do you think for a second that those men out there can keep you from me ? That they wo n’t screw up , and then the opportunity arises , you wo n’t be exactly where you need to be . At my feet , serving me . Once I ’ve done having my fun , I ’ll be sure to send Lewis your pretty head , with no body of course . ”
39505	39653	39654	39654	She	864	“ Let ’s get one thing straight . You and I end up in that situation again , you will be the one on the floor licking your own blood . That trainer was right . Every single second of every single day I was with you , I thought of all the ways I could kill you . Go ahead , Elijah , kill me . Hit me . Do your worst . There ’s a roomful of witnesses outside . They ’re closing in on you and on Robert . Your days of being king are numbered . If you were smart , you ’d get out and leave . But you and I both know you ’re not smart . You ’re stupid , and I was a fucking idiot to think that you were anything more than a pathetic excuse for a man . ”
39666	39724	39656	39656	her	864	“ Lewis is a man . He ’s one hundred percent perfect . You , you ’re a coward who gets power out of beating women . That does n’t make strong . You ’re weak . You ’ve always been weak . You could never break me because I am strong , and you ’re not ! ”
39739	39750	39732	39732	she	864	“ Do n’t forget , Elijah , someone might see . ”
40189	40202	40203	40203	he	10	“ I ’ve been thinking about opening a shelter of some kind , ”
40206	40211	40203	40203	he	10	“ For the homeless ? ”
40239	40272	40225	40225	He	10	“ Not just for the homeless . I was thinking for the women we rescue who do n’t have a family to go to , and also for kids who run away . ”
40273	40282	40283	40283	she	13	“ How do you think that will work ? ”
40286	40297	40283	40283	she	13	“ They ’re running away for a reason , right ? ”
40301	40375	40298	40298	She	13	“ It can be problems at home , or feeling like they ’re not being listened to . They ’re easily preyed upon . I want to create a sanctuary they can go to . They ’re protected . They can have food , a warm bed , a place to stay , and I can employ someone , or a lot of people , who can help to figure out their problems . ”
40376	40384	40385	40385	she	13	“ It sounds like a great idea , ”
40388	40391	40385	40385	she	13	“ But ? ”
40392	40405	40298	40298	She	13	“ Is n’t that why they have foster homes and child protection ? ”
40406	40455	40298	40298	She	13	“ They fail . We know that . We do n’t like to admit it , but they do . This could help boys and girls make that fresh start . I want to give it a try . I think it is something that could really work . ”
40456	40465	40466	40466	She	13	“ I ’m with you a hundred percent . ”
40474	40487	40488	40488	he	885	“ Have you seen the girls that run away ? The boys ? ”
40499	40518	40491	40491	She	13	“ Yes . Even though they were … guarded , they were at times the easiest to fool . ”
40519	40529	40466	40466	She	13	“ The offer of food , warmth , love ? ”
40530	40555	40491	40491	She	13	“ Yes . Something that is easier than what they ’ve experienced so far . I did n’t say any of this was pretty . ”
40564	40588	40559	40559	she	13	“ There was something I wanted to give to you . I finally finished it , and I wanted you to have it . ”
40613	40618	40619	40619	he	885	“ What is this ? ”
40622	40675	40619	40619	he	885	“ This is my story . It ’s not always pretty or nice , but it ’s my story . I wanted you to have it , and before we get married , I want you to read it . I want to see if you still wish to marry me afterward . ”
40683	40695	40619	40619	he	885	“ This wo n’t change my view of you , Mandy . ”
40696	40702	40703	40703	She	13	“ It hurts at times . ”
40709	40734	40735	40735	She	13	“ I feel like the pain wo n’t stop , and then I ca n’t breathe . I want you to read my story . ”
40744	40757	40735	40735	She	13	“ I ’ve numbered the notebooks so you know the first one . ”
41085	41100	41101	41101	I	0	“ Hey , girly , can you tell us where the gas station is ? ”
41335	41341	41329	41329	he	904	“ You ’re mine now . ”
41347	41357	41342	41342	I	0	“ No . I ’ve got to go home . ”
41399	41407	41408	41408	Mandy	13	“ You do n’t need to cry , ”
41417	41423	41411	41411	Lewis	10	“ How can I not ? ”
41424	41429	41430	41430	She	13	“ I ’m alive . ”
41435	41443	41430	41430	She	13	“ This is not to torture you . ”
41444	41469	41411	41411	Lewis	10	“ I do n’t care what things you ’ve done . Everything you did was because of what you ’d been told to do . ”
41470	41477	41478	41478	she	13	“ Does that make it right ? ”
41481	41493	41478	41478	she	13	“ I helped them get girls . I was a monster . ”
41506	41521	41500	41500	He	10	“ I think your words should be made available for the world to see . ”
41522	41531	41532	41532	she	13	“ Please , for me , read it , ”
41546	41577	41535	41535	She	13	“ That is my story . That is the woman you want to marry , and I need to know above everything else that you ’ll be happy with me . ”
42409	42422	42423	42423	Lewis	10	“ I love you , Lewis . I love you so much . ”
42426	42440	42423	42423	Lewis	10	“ You ’ve never reacted like this when I ’ve come home before . ”
42448	42452	42441	42441	His	10	“ Why now ? ”
42531	42544	42526	42526	he	10	“ That was some welcome . What ’s going on , Mandy ? ”
42555	42580	42526	42526	he	10	“ I know you finished my diaries . The last one was on the pile , and I saw your bookmark at the end . ”
42581	42589	42620	42620	his	10	“ Ah , and you ’re worried . ”
42590	42611	42612	42612	He	10	“ Everything I wrote was true . There ’s nothing made up there . It ’s all from the heart . ”
42623	42643	42612	42612	He	10	“ I have no doubt at all . Did you expect me to fall out of love with you ? ”
42679	42688	42671	42671	she	13	“ Erm , do n’t you hate me ? ”
42772	42794	42795	42795	He	10	“ Mandy , I could never hate you . It ’s not even possible for me to get angry with you . ”
42805	42872	42795	42795	He	10	“ You ’re my angel . My reason for fighting all these years , and you will be my reason to keep on fighting . To help others . You think I do n’t look back to that day and wish I had n’t done things differently ? I was mowing a lawn . You know , I ’ve not mowed a lawn since that day . ”
42873	42876	42877	42877	He	10	“ What ? ”
42882	42902	42879	42879	his	10	“ I guess the last time was enough of a punishment for me . There ’s nothing worth it . ”
42903	42910	42795	42795	He	10	“ You were n’t to blame . ”
42911	42977	42879	42879	his	10	“ But that was what I was doing . I was mowing the lawn , thinking about football , and having a drink . I was n’t even thinking about you , Mandy . I was taking care of you because I figured it would be easy . You were always trying to impress me , so you were an easy kid to look after . ”
42997	43006	42984	42984	she	935	“ You have nothing to be embarrassed about . ”
43007	43041	42795	42795	He	10	“ Your family blames me . I ’ve not spoken to your brother in years because of it . I was asked to take care of you . I did n’t do that . ”
43042	43072	42879	42879	his	10	“ I helped them . I went to the car that day ! Not only that , but throughout the years , I helped to lure girls , Lewis . ”
43073	43126	43127	43127	He	938	“ I know . I read everything you wrote , Mandy . Your story , it breaks my heart to know all that you went through . There ’s no way I could have ever fallen out of love with you . It ’s not possible for me to feel that way . ”
43134	43160	43161	43161	He	938	“ I love you , Mandy . I ’ll love you for the rest of my life , and that is never going to change . ”
43256	43267	43243	43243	Lewis	10	“ Is Jamie forcing you to do all the details ? ”
43268	43315	43243	43243	Lewis	10	“ He wants me to put my spin on everything , but I do n’t know . I struggle to make these kinds of decisions . I ’d dress in jeans if it meant I got to be with you for the rest of my life . ”
43316	43341	43342	43342	Mandy	13	“ Then how about we cancel all this and head out right now ? We go to Vegas , and I ’ll marry you . ”
43345	43353	43342	43342	Mandy	13	“ Are you being real right now ? ”
43354	43408	43409	43409	She	13	“ As real as I can be . I do n’t need all that fancy shit . It ’ll piss Jamie off , but this is about what we want . I did n’t know if you wanted the big white wedding , with the guests , the cake , and everything else . ”
43414	43437	43409	43409	She	13	“ No . I do n’t want that . I just want you , Lewis . I will only ever want you . ”
43480	43488	43489	43489	Jamie	15	“ I ’m still pissed at you , ”
43495	43498	43492	43492	Lewis	10	“ Why ? ”
43499	43548	43549	43549	Jamie	15	“ I was really looking forward to hosting this event , and what do I hear of being replaced , huh ? I get told in a damn newspaper that one of the country ’s most eligible bachelors tied the knot in some quick wedding place in Vegas . ”
43570	43617	43557	43566	The rest of the guys at the Billionaire Bikers MC	947	“ Seriously ? You really think Mandy or I wanted this big wedding ? You were bringing cake to my office . Have you ever thought about becoming a wedding planner ? You seem to enjoy that kind of work a lot more than anything else . ”
43618	43622	43623	43623	Jamie	15	“ Bite me . ”
43631	43690	43623	43623	Jamie	15	“ Look , it was nothing personal about you or the way you do things . Mandy and I , we just wanted it to be about us , and we got our wish . If you ’d like , and I will double - check this with her , we ’ll renew our vows just for you . ”
43691	43726	43727	43727	Lewis	10	“ I had picked out the perfect lemon cake . Both of you had liked it , and the buttercream was just divine . I ’m upset , and it ’s all your fault . ”
43906	43915	43916	43916	Russ	11	“ Shall we get back to business now ? ”
43919	43940	43916	43916	Russ	11	“ Congratulations on your marriage . I know this happiness has been a long time coming for both of you . ”
43944	43948	43941	43941	Lewis	10	“ Thank you . ”
43957	43965	43966	43966	Russ	11	“ Right , we have a problem , ”
43982	43998	43975	43975	he	11	“ This came in while you were getting married , but we waited for you . ”
44019	44025	44026	44026	he	10	“ This is n’t real , ”
44046	44057	44058	44058	Blake	24	“ It ’s not one of your warehouses , Lewis , ”
44061	44081	44082	44082	He	10	“ It ’s not possible for it to be mine . I have them all on my security detail . ”
44088	44094	44095	44095	Russ	11	“ This is a trap , ”
44147	44158	44133	44133	She	963	“ Your security only works if someone is monitoring it . ”
44166	44226	44227	44227	Lewis	10	“ Do you really think I ’d slack in that department ? Every single one of my warehouses is guarded . I have security footage , and none of them have been compromised . I ’m guessing this is from one of the warehouses I could n’t get . Someone snapped it up before me . A private investor . ”
44362	44369	44378	44378	Blake	24	“ What else do we know ? ”
44370	44377	44378	44378	Blake	24	“ That Elijah wants Mandy dead , ”
44381	44398	44399	44399	Lewis	10	“ This is not really news . We ’ve been aware of it for some time , ”
44406	44433	44402	44402	Jamie	15	“ I do n’t like this one bit . Something stinks here , and I have a feeling this is a trap to lure us there . ”
44434	44449	44450	44450	Lewis	10	“ Then we tell our informant . At least we get rid of Robert , ”
44484	44492	44503	44503	Blake	24	“ We ca n’t just do nothing . ”
44493	44502	44503	44503	Blake	24	“ We do n’t want to do nothing , ”
44506	44523	44503	44503	Blake	24	“ This is a test . I do n’t want us to fuck this up either . ”
44524	44543	44544	44544	Lewis	10	“ Do you think that he ’s trying to get us there so that he can take Mandy ? ”
44558	44563	44544	44544	Lewis	10	“ It ’s possible . ”
44564	44620	44621	44621	He	10	“ Then give this information to the informant . As much as I ’d love to wipe that smirk off Robert ’s face , I want him locked up . You ’ve heard the rumors of what they do to cops inside . Let ’s see if he can work his way out of that . ”
44983	44989	44990	44990	she	13	“ I ’ve missed you , ”
44993	45000	44990	44990	she	13	“ I can tell , baby . ”
45065	45070	45071	45071	he	10	“ I love you , ”
45087	45094	45095	45095	Lewis	10	“ I love you , too . ”
45102	45111	45095	45095	Lewis	10	“ We ’re causing a few curious stares . ”
45118	45125	45126	45126	He	10	“ I only care about you . ”
45146	45152	45143	45143	his	10	“ I ’ll do it . ”
45209	45214	45215	45215	she	13	“ What is this ? ”
45295	45301	45273	45273	herself	13	“ This is a trap . ”
45302	45339	45340	45340	Mandy	13	“ We figured as much . We ’ve already informed our guy in the police force with the warning of Robert ’s interference . We ’ve got all the information we need about what is happening . ”
45553	45569	45570	45570	Lewis	10	“ I fear our time of being a club could be coming to an end , ”
45573	45576	45570	45570	Lewis	10	“ Why ? ”
45585	45597	45577	45577	She	13	“ You ca n’t possibly mean to break up the club . ”
45598	45638	45662	45662	Mandy	13	“ We ’re known by those two men , possibly more . I ca n’t risk it , and neither can the rest of the guys . They do n’t want to put anyone else ’s lives at risk . ”
45639	45646	45647	45647	Mandy	13	“ This is not about you , ”
45650	45656	45647	45647	Mandy	13	“ This is a trap . ”
45657	45661	45662	45662	Mandy	13	“ For me . ”
45683	45727	45728	45728	He	10	“ No . I ’m not going to allow you to blame yourself . Those monsters do n’t have a right to you , Mandy . They took you once and believed you were nothing but property , and you never fucking were ! ”
45733	45751	45728	45728	He	10	“ They ’re doing this because of me , Lewis . How can you not see that ? ”
45752	45806	45807	45807	He	10	“ I do see that , and I know what you ’re thinking . Lure them into a trap , and then we can get them or some shit like that . It ’s not happening . I lost you once , and I ’m not willing to put you at risk again . ”
45819	45841	45842	45842	She	13	“ You can hate me all you want . It ’s not going to happen . I wo n’t let it . ”
45851	45883	45842	45842	She	13	“ He ’s not going to stop , Lewis . You know that . I know that . He ’s going to keep on coming and try to find a weakness . ”
45884	45905	45906	45906	Mandy	13	“ He wo n’t . The club is strong , Mandy . He ’s not going to get to you . ”
46403	46408	46409	46409	Cameron	17	“ Hello , sir , ”
46424	46431	46432	46432	he	32	“ Cameron , what is it ? ”
46435	46455	46432	46432	he	32	“ The babysitter just called . My son is really sick . I need to go and get him . ”
46456	46472	46473	46473	he	32	“ Yes . Of course . There ’s nothing left for today , is there ? ”
46479	46491	46492	46492	He	32	“ No . Everything is done . Thank you , Lewis . ”
46734	46755	46717	46717	Elijah	32	“ I always win , Lewis . Do n’t worry , I intend to keep her alive for some time . ”
46808	46819	46793	46793	Elijah	32	“ I ’ll give her something to send your regards . ”
46882	46961	46962	46962	Elijah	32	“ You know , I thought this was going to be harder , and then it dawned on me . The thing about rich boys is they really believe they ’re untouchable . You got sloppy , Lewis . Kind of disappointing . I was hoping to use you , you know . To show her that you had no power . Also , to show her that no matter what you wo n’t be coming after her . ”
47066	47071	47059	47059	Jamie	15	“ So what do — ”
47072	47087	47059	47059	Jamie	15	“ Get to Mandy now … he ’s on his way . Been shot ! ”
47088	47091	47092	47092	He	10	“ Lewis ? ”
47120	47123	47124	47124	Mandy	13	“ Hello , ”
47138	47143	47133	47133	She	13	“ He ’s coming . ”
47501	47510	47511	47516	the guard at the main desk	1077	“ Sir , can I see some identification ? ”
47519	47522	47511	47516	the guard at the main desk	1077	“ Sure . ”
47820	47826	47827	47827	She	13	“ Was n’t expecting that ? ”
47955	47974	47975	47975	she	13	“ What ’s the matter , Elijah , too shocked to see a woman fight for her life ? ”
47978	47983	47975	47975	she	13	“ Does it hurt ? ”
48002	48008	48009	48009	he	32	“ I shot your man , ”
48056	48064	48065	48065	she	13	“ You ’re going to die tonight , ”
48068	48092	48065	48065	she	13	“ I always knew that if we met again , one of us would die . It ’s not going to be me . ”
48108	48205	48100	48100	Elijah	32	“ You know , I ’ve been doing a lot of reading of late . A lot of soul - searching . I thought you were this big monster . That you had all the power , and that was n’t the truth . You have no power . Not over me , not over anyone . You prey on women because you ’re a coward . There is no power with you . The only power you have is what I give you . You ’re weak . You ’re pathetic . You mean nothing ! ”
48462	48467	48468	48468	she	1090	“ Where is he ? ”
48471	48496	48468	48468	she	1090	“ Jamie just called . They ’ve got him to the hospital . He ’s in surgery , Mandy , but it ’s bad . ”
48625	48630	48631	48631	she	1090	“ What ’s happened ? ”
48634	48664	48665	48665	She	1090	“ He ’s in surgery right now . He ’s lost a lot of blood . Right now , he ’s in the best possible hands he can be . ”
48674	48681	48682	48682	She	1090	“ Take a seat , Mandy . ”
48761	48797	48756	48757	the doctor	132	“ We have removed the bullets and sealed up the wounds . He ’s lost a lot of blood and we ’ve given him a blood transfusion . All we can do now is wait . ”
48798	48804	48805	48805	she	1090	“ Can I see him ? ”
48819	48825	48826	48826	Jamie	15	“ This is his wife , ”
48829	48853	48826	48826	Jamie	15	“ Then only two people can go . He ’s not awake at the moment . All you can do is watch him . ”
48854	48870	48871	48871	Jamie	15	“ That ’s all I want . It ’s what he ’d do for me . ”
49020	49031	49032	49032	Jamie	15	“ You really do love him , do n’t you ? ”
49045	49085	49040	49040	he	10	“ Always . It has always been Lewis . I would gladly die for him , and I know he would do the same for me . I hope he wakes up and knows that our threat is gone . ”
49086	49095	49035	49035	She	13	“ There will always be monsters to chase . ”
49096	49210	49211	49211	Jamie	15	“ Yes , but now he can be free in knowing that we ’re all safe . Elijah ’s gone . Robert ’s gone . Lewis is my hero . He ’s going to wake up , and he ’s going to get through this . We ’re going to buy that house he always wanted , and we ’re going to fill it with children . That was his wish . His dream , and he told me about it . At first , I thought I did n’t deserve to be so happy , but I do , and so does Lewis . I just want to give him the world . ”
49264	49269	49270	49270	Jamie	15	“ He ’ll live , ”
49273	49282	49270	49270	Jamie	15	“ He has to make sure you survived . ”
49396	49406	49407	49407	Lewis	10	“ I do n’t want to leave this hospital , ”
49457	49461	49448	49448	She	13	“ Why not ? ”
49462	49480	49481	49481	He	10	“ You ’ve given me your undivided attention , and I love that smile on your lips . ”
49527	49562	49563	49563	He	10	“ You ’re the one who sends me to school . I ’ll happily stay by your side . Do you think you can negotiate your big business while you ’re staring at me ? ”
49760	49764	49765	49765	she	1132	“ Thank you , ”
49777	49781	49768	49768	He	10	“ For what ? ”
49782	49806	49807	49807	She	1132	“ Even when you were hurting , you still warned me . You ’re the best man a woman could ever ask for . ”
49815	49822	49807	49807	She	1132	“ I love you so much . ”
49823	49842	49843	49843	He	10	“ It has always been you . For me , there is no one else in this world . ”
49858	49863	49864	49864	Blake	24	“ Are we interrupting ? ”
49886	49893	49881	49881	Lewis	10	“ What are you guys doing ? ”
49894	49922	49923	49923	Jamie	15	“ You ’re still sick , and last time we checked , you were still part of the club , and we wanted to give you this . ”
49957	49962	49952	49953	the club	70	“ What is this ? ”
49963	49973	49974	49974	Blake	24	“ We ’ve decided to cut to the chase , ”
49977	49988	49989	49989	John	20	“ One big event that brings all the MCs together , ”
49992	50002	49989	49989	John	20	“ I think it ’s going to be awesome . ”
50003	50012	50013	50013	Lewis	10	“ Who have you sent this out to ? ”
50039	50066	50029	50029	He	10	“ The Skulls , Chaos Bleeds , Dirty Fuckers , Saints and Sinners , you know , several groups of clubs . It could be fun . ”
50067	50076	50077	50077	Lewis	10	“ Or we could all kill each other , ”
50080	50100	50077	50077	Lewis	10	“ Nah , we wo n’t . It ’s time we came out and showed them we mean business , ”
50104	50119	50120	50120	Mandy	13	“ Look at it that you ’ll get a chance to host a party , ”
50123	50132	50120	50120	Mandy	13	“ Not something like the charity gala either . ”
50133	50142	50143	50143	he	10	“ You did n’t like the charity gala ? ”
50146	50192	50193	50193	He	10	“ You guys are all billionaires and businessmen , but I know that ’s not who you really are . This is who you really are . Real men , real people , and I think it would be nice for others to see that . ”
50254	50263	50243	50243	he	10	“ You know this is crazy , right ? ”
50264	50307	50308	50308	She	13	“ Absolutely . I think it ’s totally crazy , insane , and stupid , but you know what , who cares ? It will either be fun , or a total nightmare , and you ’ve got time to organize it . ”
50311	50323	50308	50308	She	13	“ There ’s something I wanted to talk to you about . ”
50324	50329	50243	50243	he	10	“ What is it ? ”
50330	50341	50342	50342	she	13	“ I was wondering what you think about having children ? ”
50349	50354	50355	50355	She	13	“ Are you pregnant ? ”
50360	50410	50357	50357	her	13	“ Not yet , but I was hoping one day soon , I could be . I would really like to be a mother . I do n’t want to put it off any longer . I want to be your wife , and the mother of your children . ”
50411	50421	50422	50422	She	13	“ I should have gotten shot a lot sooner . ”
50427	50434	50422	50422	She	13	“ I love you , Lewis . ”
50650	50675	50676	50676	Lewis	10	“ Phew , I tell you , what are we feeding this guy ? That has to be the biggest poop in the world , ”
50715	50720	50699	50699	she	13	“ I love you . ”
50721	50745	50746	50746	She	13	“ Love you , too , babe . I must love you . I ca n’t believe I offered to change his diaper . ”
50759	50763	50764	50764	He	211	“ They came . ”
50775	50785	50786	50786	He	211	“ I ’m so proud of you , honey . ”
50957	50965	50966	50966	he	10	“ You ’re a survivor , baby , ”
50969	50973	50966	50966	he	10	“ You won . ”
51002	51011	50996	50996	Lewis	10	“ What would you like to do today ? ”
51012	51017	50996	50996	Lewis	10	“ Anything you want . ”
51018	51037	50996	50996	Lewis	10	“ Then I want us to stay in all day . Just relax and enjoy being a family . ”
51038	51042	50996	50996	Lewis	10	“ Sounds perfect . ”
51103	51131	51133	51133	Lisa	47	“ Scarlett , are you being serious ? No , I know you ’re not being serious , because if you were , you ’d be insane , ”
51135	51156	51133	51133	Lisa	47	“ I have no choice . You heard Carter . He ’s going to cut twenty freelancers this year alone . ”
51177	51185	51157	51157	Scarlett	46	“ I ca n’t lose this job . ”
51186	51198	51199	51199	Scarlett	46	“ Fine , I get it , but this is suicide . ”
51204	51210	51211	51211	She	46	“ You ’re being dramatic . ”
51444	51452	51454	51454	Lisa	47	“ Are you taking a camera crew ? ”
51465	51506	51507	51507	Lisa	47	“ Yeah , like that ’s going to happen . Look , I ’ll be fine . Promise . Semenov wants to portray a favorable image to the media , so he ’s going to be on his best behavior . ”
51510	51526	51507	51507	Lisa	47	“ You ’re impossible . See you tomorrow then ? I ’ll bring the coffee . ”
51527	51530	51507	51507	Lisa	47	“ Thanks . ”
51907	51919	51920	51920	she	46	“ I have an appointment at eight o’clock for an interview , ”
51985	51996	51998	51998	he	1199	“ Mr. Semenov will see you in the sitting room . ”
52119	52123	52125	52126	another man	1212	“ Sit here , ”
52135	52143	52125	52126	another man	1212	“ He will be with you shortly . ”
52665	52669	52670	52670	he	1232	“ Shut up , ”
52679	52690	52670	52670	he	1232	“ I ’m innocent . Please do n’t hurt me … ”
52726	52733	52712	52712	he	1232	“ You one of his whores ? ”
53079	53084	53092	53092	he	1232	“ Please let me — ”
53085	53091	53092	53092	he	1232	“ Do n’t fucking speak , ”
53395	53414	53388	53388	he	51	“ I ’ll do anything . Please let me go . I promise I wo n’t say anything . ”
53498	53508	53492	53492	he	51	“ Why were you at Alexei Semenov ’s house ? ”
53509	53534	53535	53535	she	46	“ I was just on a job , I mean I was doing an interview … well I was going to do an interview , ”
53538	53571	53535	53535	she	46	“ I ’m a reporter . Well , I ’m a researcher trying to be a reporter . I swear I do n’t know him or you or anything about what happened . ”
53589	53596	53578	53579	A reporter	1171	“ Who knows you were there ? ”
53597	53600	53601	53601	He	1269	“ Nobody . ”
53662	53669	53670	53670	He	1269	“ You should have stayed home . ”
54101	54115	54116	54116	She	1288	“ Walk . If you try anything stupid , I ’ll kill you . ”
54389	54394	54395	54395	she	1297	“ Where are we ? ”
54398	54423	54395	54395	she	1297	“ It ’s your final destination . No hard feelings , but damn , you were in the wrong place at the wrong time . ”
54428	54438	54426	54426	herself	1297	“ What are you going to do to me ? ”
54439	54448	54449	54449	he	51	“ Relax . I ’m not raping you , ”
54474	54480	54462	54462	He	51	“ Please let me leave . ”
54481	54487	54488	54488	He	51	“ That ’s not happening . ”
