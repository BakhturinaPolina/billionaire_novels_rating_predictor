1358	1369	1353	1353	he	53	“ Yes , Venezia ? What is it this time ? ”
1370	1378	1353	1353	he	53	“ Michael , I ’m in trouble . ”
1405	1414	1390	1390	her	225	“ Did you say you ’re getting married ? ”
1415	1423	1424	1424	She	225	“ Were n’t you listening , Michael ? ”
1430	1436	1424	1424	She	225	“ You must help me ! ”
1437	1451	1390	1390	her	225	“ Go slowly . Deep breaths , then tell me the whole story . ”
1452	1461	1462	1462	she	225	“ Mama wo n’t let me get married ! ”
1466	1549	1462	1462	she	225	“ And it ’s all your fault . You know Dominick and I have been together for years , and I ’ve been hoping and praying he ’d pop the question and he finally did . Oh , Michael , he brought me to the Piazza Vecchia and got down on his knee and the ring is beautiful , just beautiful ! Of course , I said yes , and then we rushed to Mama to tell the whole family , and — ”
1550	1568	1390	1390	her	225	“ Wait a minute . Dominick never called me to ask permission for your hand in marriage . ”
1574	1583	1584	1584	His	226	“ Why did n’t I know of this ? ”
1591	1663	1584	1585	His sister	227	“ You have got to be kidding me ! That custom is ancient , and you ’re not even here , and everyone knows we were getting married ; it was just a matter of time . Anyway , none of this matters because I ’m going to be an old maid and I ’ll lose Dominick forever . He ’ll never wait for me and it ’s all your fault ! ”
1674	1681	1664	1664	His	226	“ How is this my fault ? ”
1682	1704	1670	1670	Venezia	56	“ Mama told me I ca n’t get married until you ’re married . Remember that ridiculous tradition Papa believed in ? ”
1770	1779	1780	1780	he	226	“ I ’m sure there was a miscommunication , ”
1784	1791	1780	1780	he	226	“ I ’ll straighten this out . ”
1792	1868	1780	1780	he	226	“ She told Dominick I can wear the ring , but there will be no wedding until you marry . Then Dominick got upset and said he does n’t know how long he can wait before he starts his life with me , and Mama got mad and called him disrespectful , and we had a big fight and now my life is over , all over ! How can she do this to me ? ”
1909	1913	1914	1914	he	53	“ Calm down , ”
1929	1956	1917	1917	She	56	“ Everyone knows you and Dominick are meant to be together . I do n’t want you to worry . I will talk to Mama today . ”
1961	1997	1917	1917	She	56	“ What if you ca n’t ? What if she disowns me if I marry Dominick without her approval ? I ’ll lose everything . But how can I give up the man I love ? ”
2089	2126	2081	2081	He	53	“ You will not do anything until I speak with her . Do you understand , Venezia ? I will take care of it . Just tell Dominick to hold on until I get this settled . ”
2127	2130	2131	2131	Her	56	“ Okay . ”
2460	2467	2468	2468	Maggie	50	“ Here , take the baby . ”
2515	2520	2511	2512	her niece	261	“ Oh , gross ! ”
2577	2625	2563	2563	her	63	“ Sorry , Lily , Aunt Maggie does n’t do diapers . When you get older I ’ll teach you how to ride a motorcycle , score a hot guy for the prom , and buy your first fake ID . Till then , I ’m out . ”
2822	2829	2834	2834	his	53	“ Are you okay , cara ? ”
3113	3122	3104	3104	She	50	“ Hello , Count . What brings you ? ”
3128	3138	3104	3104	She	50	“ I ’d never miss Alexa ’s birthday party . ”
3139	3162	3163	3163	His	53	“ No , of course not . You do n’t seem to miss many events that revolve around Alexa , do you ? ”
3167	3176	3163	3163	His	53	“ Are you questioning my motives , cara ? ”
3306	3330	3331	3331	Michael	53	“ Of course not . Just making a comment on the close personal relationship you seem to have with my brother ’s wife . ”
3357	3395	3396	3396	She	50	“ Ah , but Alexa and I are friends , no ? And without your brother , my bakery would never have gotten off the ground . He ’s done an amazing job with the architectural design . ”
3399	3406	3396	3396	She	50	“ Convenient , is n’t it ? ”
3453	3465	3466	3466	he	53	“ Do you have something to say to me , Maggie ? ”
3473	3489	3466	3466	he	53	“ I remember from our dinner date you are usually more . . . blunt . ”
3509	3522	3523	3523	He	53	“ And I remember you ’re usually more . . . honest . ”
3532	3544	3523	3523	He	53	“ Yes , perhaps we both made a mistake that night . ”
3577	3603	3562	3562	He	53	“ I have to go find Alexa . Lily has a dirty diaper . Would you do us a favor and change her , please ? ”
3608	3624	3604	3604	She	50	“ After all , you ’re practically family . You know where the nursery is . ”
4041	4067	4068	4068	Maggie	50	“ Why are n’t you eating ? I need support . I ’m trying to lose the baby weight but these appetizers are too good . ”
4075	4094	4068	4068	Maggie	50	“ You look fantastic . God , your boobs are huge . I ’m so frickin ’ jealous . ”
4118	4143	4112	4112	Alexa	52	“ The benefits of breast - feeding . Let ’s hope I do n’t leak and ruin my sexy effect . Where ’s Lily ? ”
4150	4160	4161	4161	Alexa	52	“ With Michael . He ’s changing her diaper . ”
4164	4188	4189	4189	She	52	“ Why did you do that to him ? You ’re always giving him a hard time . I have to go help . ”
4203	4245	4198	4198	Maggie	50	“ Oh , all right , I ’ll go check on him . I ’m sure he gave Lily to your mom . He ’s not stupid , Al , and he ’s a man . Men do n’t change diapers . ”
4246	4250	4251	4251	Maggie	50	“ Nick does . ”
4256	4270	4251	4251	Maggie	50	“ Rarely . He gave Lily to me because he knew she pooped . ”
4281	4332	4333	4333	Maggie	50	“ Why am I surprised ? The other night he asked me to hold her for just a minute and when I went to look for him , he ’d gone out . Out of the actual house . In his car . I mean , are you kidding me ? ”
4336	4355	4356	4356	Alexa	52	“ I ’ll schedule a shopping trip with you soon and we ’ll make him pay . Literally . ”
4359	4412	4413	4413	Maggie	50	“ Go save Michael . And be nice to him , for God ’s sake . I do n’t know what ’s up with you two . It ’s been almost a year since you went out on that blind date . Did something else happen you did n’t tell me about ? ”
4416	4439	4413	4413	Maggie	50	“ Nope . I told you , I think he ’s secretly in love with you . But no one believes me . ”
4440	4444	4445	4445	Alexa	52	“ This again ? ”
4450	4482	4445	4445	Alexa	52	“ Maggs , we ’re just friends . He ’s like family . Trust me , even Nick came around — there ’s nothing between Michael and me . Never was . ”
4483	4486	4487	4487	Maggie	50	“ Right . ”
4599	4618	4595	4595	Maggie	50	“ Enjoy your food , birthday girl , and do n’t worry . I ’ll go rescue him . ”
4695	4702	4683	4683	He	53	“ Twinkle , Twinkle Little Star . ”
4879	4885	4886	4886	she	50	“ What are you doing ? ”
4898	4901	4890	4890	He	53	“ Singing . ”
4913	4931	4902	4902	She	50	“ I mean , the diaper . You changed her ? And why is she wearing that ? ”
4936	4970	4902	4902	She	50	“ Of course I changed her , just as you asked , cara . Her dress was dirty , so I picked out a new one . Why do you look so surprised ? ”
4971	5000	5001	5001	Michael	53	“ Figured you were raised with that old - fashioned attitude . You know , men are leaders and do n’t cook , clean , or do diapers . ”
5019	5065	5011	5011	Lily	63	“ You have n’t met my mother . I grew up with three younger sisters . When a diaper needed changing it was my responsibility , and there was no game of pass - the - baby . I tried that once and paid dearly . ”
5066	5069	5070	5070	She	63	“ Oh . ”
5077	5085	5070	5070	She	63	“ Is your family back in Italy ? ”
5086	5130	5011	5011	Lily	63	“ Yes . The original La Dolce Famiglia started in Bergamo , where we live . Then we expanded into Milan and have been quite successful . I decided to continue the tradition in America , and my sister runs the home base . ”
5131	5137	5070	5070	She	63	“ What about your dad ? ”
5146	5156	5011	5011	Lily	63	“ My father passed on a few years ago . ”
5157	5162	5163	5163	she	63	“ I ’m sorry , ”
5167	5177	5163	5163	she	63	“ It sounds like you have a close family . ”
5178	5187	5188	5188	He	316	“ Si . I miss him every day . ”
5194	5210	5188	5188	He	316	“ And what about you ? I guess you never had to change a diaper ? ”
5218	5266	5211	5211	She	63	“ I had it made . Nick was older , so I had no younger siblings to worry about . Never had to lift a finger because we lived in a mansion with a maid , a cook , and a nanny . I was spoiled rotten . ”
5304	5320	5301	5301	he	316	“ No , cara . I think you had it harder than most of us . ”
5352	5358	5359	5359	she	63	“ Think what you like , ”
5363	5370	5359	5359	she	63	“ But stop calling me sweetheart . ”
5432	5439	5440	5440	His	316	“ Fine , la mia tigrotta . ”
5459	5463	5455	5455	Maggie	50	“ Very funny . ”
5469	5491	5464	5464	He	316	“ It is not meant to be funny . You reminded me of a little tiger the first moment we met . ”
5515	5528	5529	5529	He	316	“ We better get out there . Alexa was looking for Lily . ”
5546	5558	5542	5542	Alexa	52	“ Maggie , darling , I ’ve been looking for you ! ”
5578	5591	5592	5592	She	71	“ Here is my beautiful granddaughter . Come here , my darling . ”
5602	5617	5592	5592	She	71	“ I heard she needed changing but it seems you make a good team . ”
5641	5667	5638	5638	Michael	53	“ Ah , Mrs. McKenzie , you know how wonderful Maggie is about taking care of her niece . I only sat back and watched . ”
5694	5712	5713	5713	Maria	71	“ I ’m having a small dinner for everyone this Friday and insist you both join me , ”
5742	5769	5731	5731	She	50	“ I ’m sorry , Mrs. McKenzie , I ’ll be flying to Milan this week . I leave in two days for a photo shoot . ”
5770	5803	5804	5804	Alexa	52	“ Then I will reschedule for when you arrive back home . Now , let me take this little one back out to the party , and I will see you later . ”
5821	5832	5833	5833	She	50	“ You ’re flying to Milan ? For how long ? ”
5836	5855	5833	5833	She	50	“ Probably a week . I ’ll take some time to make new contacts , do some shopping . ”
5856	5859	5868	5868	He	53	“ Hmmm . ”
5906	5918	5919	5919	She	50	“ Dude , why are you looking at me like that ? ”
5974	5983	5984	5984	he	53	“ I may have a proposition for you , ”
6001	6014	5987	5987	She	50	“ Sorry , babe . That ship has sailed and left port . ”
6245	6274	6282	6282	Julietta	58	“ Michael , I do n’t know what you heard , but to use one of your American phrases , the shit is about to hit the fan . ”
6302	6334	6293	6300	the perfect person to run La Dolce Famiglia	338	“ Mama promised Papa on his deathbed she ’d continue the traditions of the family . Unfortunately , that included having you marry first , no matter how ridiculous it sounds . ”
6335	6347	6348	6348	Michael	53	“ I ’m sure I can talk her out of it , ”
6361	6486	6348	6348	Michael	53	“ Not gon na happen . I think Venezia is planning to elope . If she does , disaster will be an understatement . We ’ll be at war with Dominick ’s family , and Mama threatened to disown her . Carina is going through a hard time right now , and she ’s been crying nonstop thinking her family is falling apart . Mama called the doctor and told him she was having a heart attack , but he diagnosed her with a bad case of indigestion and sent her to bed . Dios , please tell me you ’re seeing someone serious and can take care of this situation ? Damn patriarchal society . I can not believe Papa bought this crap . ”
6626	6638	6639	6639	he	339	“ I ’ll be married by the end of the week , ”
6653	6673	6639	6639	he	339	“ Tell Venezia not to do anything rash . I ’ll call Mama and tell her the news later . ”
6674	6691	6692	6692	Michael	53	“ Are you serious ? Are you really getting married , or is this a scam ? ”
6717	6769	6715	6715	Julietta	58	“ I have been seeing someone , and was just waiting to make it official . She does n’t like a fuss and does n’t want a real wedding , though , so we ’ll probably hit the justice of the peace and then I ’ll break the news to everyone . ”
6770	6812	6879	6880	His sister	227	“ Are you telling me the truth , Michael ? Listen , this may be a mess but there ’s no reason to rush marriage just to calm down Venezia . You do n’t have to fix everything all the time . ”
6813	6819	6820	6820	he	53	“ Yes , I do , ”
6846	6860	6836	6836	He	53	“ I ’ll give you the details after I talk to my fiancée . ”
6861	6878	6879	6880	His sister	227	“ Mama will insist on meeting her . She ’s not going to take your word . ”
6894	6911	6879	6880	His sister	227	“ I know . I ’ll arrange a visit home toward the end of the summer . ”
6912	6924	6836	6836	He	53	“ What ? Who is she ? What ’s her name ? ”
6925	6938	6939	6939	He	53	“ I have to go . I ’ll call you back later . ”
7705	7723	7724	7724	He	53	“ Hmm , I wonder what put that expression on your face . Or rather , who . ”
7758	7771	7748	7748	he	53	“ Buon giorno , signora bella . Did you enjoy your party ? ”
7791	7812	7788	7788	her	50	“ Loved it . I told Nick I did n’t want a party , but you know how he gets . ”
7813	7825	7826	7826	She	50	“ That ’s the reason he ’s good at his job . ”
7831	7846	7826	7826	She	50	“ Yeah , good for business but a pain in the ass at home . ”
7851	7854	7847	7847	She	50	“ Sometimes . ”
7858	7873	7855	7855	Michael	53	“ What do you Americans like to say ? TMI — too much info ? ”
7887	7901	7879	7879	he	53	“ Sorry , I could n’t resist . I got you a present . ”
7905	7922	7902	7902	She	50	“ Michael , the cake was enough . You almost killed me it was so delicious . ”
7923	7948	7949	7949	He	53	“ It ’s a small one . You have meant a lot to me this past year , and I love seeing you happy . ”
7959	7962	7949	7949	He	53	“ Open . ”
8009	8016	8017	8017	he	53	“ It ’s Lily ’s birthstone , ”
8020	8044	8017	8017	he	53	“ Nick told me he bought you a new gold chain , so this would go perfectly with it . Do you like ? ”
8054	8059	8060	8060	she	50	“ I love it , ”
8080	8088	8064	8064	She	50	“ It ’s perfect . Thank you . ”
8089	8094	8064	8064	She	50	“ Prego , cara . ”
8247	8252	8253	8253	she	50	“ Presents , Al ? ”
8256	8260	8253	8253	she	50	“ How thoughtful . ”
8686	8694	8679	8679	Alexa	52	“ Is n’t it beautiful , Maggie ? ”
8695	8698	8699	8699	Michael	53	“ Charming . ”
8718	8727	8728	8728	she	50	“ I have to get going , babe , ”
8731	8746	8747	8747	Alexa	52	“ I have to leave for Milan soon and still have tons to do . ”
8750	8767	8747	8747	Alexa	52	“ God , what I ’d do to go to Milan and get a new wardrobe . ”
8780	8789	8790	8790	Maggie	50	“ Lily was worth a couple of pounds , ”
8794	8811	8790	8790	Maggie	50	“ I ’ll bring you back a pair of sexy heels that ’ll drive Nick mad . ”
8827	8841	8812	8812	Her	50	“ Not that it takes much the way you two go at it . ”
8842	8847	8848	8848	Nick	55	“ Go at what ? ”
8860	8864	8865	8865	Alexa	52	“ Never mind , ”
8869	8872	8873	8873	Maggie	50	“ Sex , ”
8876	8890	8873	8873	Maggie	50	“ I ’m going to Milan and bringing back Alexa some sexy shoes . ”
8895	8907	8891	8891	Nick	55	“ How about one of those silky nightie things , too ? ”
8908	8911	8912	8912	He	55	“ Nick ! ”
8922	8958	8959	8959	Maggie	50	“ What ? She ’s going to the fashion capital of the world and you do n’t want lingerie ? Hell , I do . The way you look is just . . . delicious . ”
8962	8972	8959	8959	Maggie	50	“ Done . She ’ll look hot in red . ”
8973	8979	8980	8980	Nick	55	“ I hate you both . ”
9050	9066	9067	9067	She	50	“ Maggie ? Before you leave , can I talk to you for a minute ? ”
9070	9077	9067	9067	She	50	“ Sure . What ’s up ? ”
9078	9084	9085	9085	Nick	55	“ In private , please . ”
9099	9123	9092	9092	Maggie	50	“ Give me a break , guys . It ’s not like he ’s going to ask me to marry him or anything . ”
9313	9321	9322	9322	She	50	“ I have a proposition for you . ”
9341	9354	9355	9355	She	50	“ Well , then , you ’ve come to the right girl . ”
9373	9377	9357	9357	her	50	“ Proposition away . ”
9391	9398	9399	9399	She	50	“ I need a pretend wife . ”
9402	9405	9399	9399	She	50	“ Huh ? ”
9406	9409	9410	9410	He	53	“ Si . ”
9423	9466	9410	9410	He	53	“ I am having some family difficulties and I ’m required to marry . I need someone to go to Italy with me for a week , pretend to be my wife , spend some time with my family , then leave . ”
9467	9484	9399	9399	She	50	“ Why do I suddenly feel like I dropped into the Lifetime movie of the week ? ”
9485	9490	9491	9491	She	50	“ What is Lifetime ? ”
9497	9545	9491	9491	She	50	“ Never mind , a girl thing . Um , let me think about this for a moment . You need me to pretend to be married to you , hang with your famiglia , stay in their house , and then return like nothing ever happened ? ”
9546	9549	9399	9399	She	50	“ Yes . ”
9550	9555	9556	9556	She	50	“ No , thanks . ”
9583	9592	9578	9578	She	50	“ Sorry , not into the dominating thing . ”
9593	9601	9399	9399	She	50	“ Maggie , please hear me out . ”
9602	9690	9691	9691	Michael	53	“ Hell , no . I heard enough . First off , I ’m going to Milan to work , not to be a mail - order bride . Second , we do n’t really care for each other , and your family would pick that up in a moment . Third , we ’re not even close friends , which negates me from owing you any favors . Surely , you have some lovely young thing just begging for the opportunity to shine in this role ? ”
9706	9742	9698	9698	he	53	“ Actually , that ’s why you ’ll be perfect for the job . I need someone who wo n’t get any strange ideas . Anyway , I ’m not seeing anyone at the moment . ”
9743	9749	9691	9691	Michael	53	“ What if I am ? ”
9750	9754	9755	9755	She	407	“ Are you ? ”
9771	9782	9691	9691	Michael	53	“ No . But I ’m still not doing it . ”
9783	9789	9790	9790	She	407	“ I ’ll pay you . ”
9793	9813	9790	9790	She	407	“ I do n’t need your money , Count . I make enough on my own , thank you . ”
9814	9828	9691	9691	Michael	53	“ There must be something we can bargain with . Something you want . ”
9829	9845	9846	9846	She	407	“ Sorry , I ’m a pretty happy girl . But thanks for the offer . ”
9923	9935	9912	9912	He	408	“ Fine , I guess I ’ll need to ask Alexa . ”
9960	9966	9948	9948	she	407	“ What did you say ? ”
9973	9996	9967	9967	He	408	“ I did n’t want to ask her to leave Lily so early , but I ’m sure she will help me . ”
10014	10037	10004	10004	She	407	“ Do n’t even think about it , Count . Just leave her and Nick alone . Solve your own damn problems . ”
10038	10046	10047	10047	She	407	“ As I am trying to do . ”
10076	10095	10059	10059	Her	407	“ I swear to God , if you even present such a crazy idea to them I ’ll — ”
10096	10134	10059	10059	Her	407	“ What ? Once I explain the situation , Nick will understand . Alexa has always wanted to travel to Italy , and it will only be for a few days . This is a family emergency . ”
10135	10141	10159	10159	her	407	“ You ’re not family ! ”
10162	10175	10159	10159	her	407	“ Stop interfering in their life and get one of your own . ”
10181	10193	10178	10178	his	408	“ So angry , la mia tigrotta . Are you jealous ? ”
10224	10270	10208	10208	her	407	“ No , I ’m pissed you ’re still hanging around Alexa like a lost puppy dog , and now my own brother does n’t even see it . I wish there was a way to get rid of you . I wish I could — ”
10335	10352	10329	10329	she	407	“ If I agree to this insane plan , you ’ll give me anything I want ? ”
10363	10366	10353	10353	Her	407	“ Yes . ”
10433	10441	10442	10442	He	408	“ Okay . I ’ll do it . ”
10454	10460	10464	10464	her	407	“ What do you want ? ”
10470	10480	10464	10464	her	407	“ I want you to stay away from Alexa . ”
10533	10537	10538	10538	he	408	“ Of course , ”
10541	10552	10538	10538	he	408	“ I ’ll keep my distance if you ’d like . ”
10557	10622	10553	10553	Her	407	“ Do n’t think you understand the agreement , Count . When she invites you over for Sunday dinners , you will be busy . No more visiting Lily . No more attending family functions . You can deal with Nick in a business capacity , but from now on , you will no longer consider yourself a close friend of Alexa . Capisce ? ”
10702	10722	10692	10692	she	407	“ Why are you so threatened , cara ? What are you afraid will happen between Alexa and me ? ”
10727	10740	10741	10741	she	407	“ I ’ve seen how easy it is to ruin something good , ”
10749	10778	10741	10741	she	407	“ Alexa and Nick are happy . She does n’t need a man sniffing around the sidelines . They may trust your intentions , but I do n’t . ”
10792	10802	10782	10782	Her	50	“ I see the way you look at her . ”
10895	10939	10940	10940	He	53	“ I ’m sick of everyone saying I ’m crazy . Just this once , admit to me you love her . Tell me the truth , give me your promise to stay away , and I ’ll pretend to be your bride . ”
11224	11247	11248	11248	She	50	“ I love Alexa as a friend . But I will agree to your terms if you will do this for me . ”
11322	11342	11314	11314	she	50	“ Fine . Give me your vow you ’ll stay away from her when we return . No exceptions . ”
11343	11356	11357	11357	She	50	“ How do you suggest I neatly disappear without hurting her feelings ? ”
11360	11399	11357	11357	She	50	“ We ’ll be in Italy for the week , and then you ’ll be busy . Pretend you ’re dating someone new and caught up with her . After a while , Alexa will stop asking questions . ”
11428	11434	11422	11422	he	53	“ I accept your conditions . ”
11442	11451	11436	11436	he	53	“ Now , I will tell you mine . ”
11483	11497	11498	11498	He	53	“ Wait . How do I know you wo n’t break your promise ? ”
11525	11536	11537	11537	She	50	“ Because I do not break my promises . Capisce ? ”
11540	11543	11537	11537	She	50	“ Yes . ”
11586	11624	11575	11575	He	53	“ The rules are simple . I ’ll call my mother tonight to break the news , but it will seem suspicious unless I ’m prepared . I ’ll need to agree to get married in Italy . ”
11625	11641	11642	11642	He	53	“ What ? Hell , no . I ’m not going to really marry you ! ”
11649	11723	11642	11642	He	53	“ Of course , we ’re not really going to marry . But we need to pretend . Mama is quite sharp and will remain suspicious if we do n’t seem willing to recite our marriage vows in front of her and a priest . I ’ll tell her we legally married in the States , but will apply for a license in Italy so she can take part in a second wedding . ”
11724	11737	11738	11738	Michael	53	“ What happens when the priest shows up ready to marry us ? ”
11747	11808	11809	11809	She	50	“ It takes a long time for a priest to agree to marry a couple when he does not know the bride , especially if she is n’t Catholic . It will never happen within our short visit . I ’ll tell Mama we ’re staying for two weeks , but we ’ll leave after one and cite an emergency . ”
11820	11842	11809	11809	She	50	“ You did n’t tell me why you suddenly need a wife . Ca n’t find your true Juliet , Romeo ? ”
11893	11899	11900	11900	she	50	“ I admire your mother , ”
11904	11932	11900	11900	she	50	“ It ’s hard to keep your beliefs when others mock you . At least your family believes in something . Tradition . Promises kept . Responsibility . ”
11953	11967	11947	11947	she	50	“ I just hope your plan works the way you want it to . ”
11968	11974	11975	11975	Her	50	“ What do you mean ? ”
11980	12016	12017	12017	He	53	“ Your family may not like me . I photograph underwear models for a living . And I ’m not pretending to defer to you , either , so do n’t get your hopes up . ”
12020	12071	12017	12017	He	53	“ Did n’t I tell you wives obey in every way ? Part of the bargain revolves around you treating me like royalty . You ’ll cook my supper , serve my needs , and defer to my wishes . Do n’t worry — it ’s only for a week . ”
12143	12166	12139	12139	Her	50	“ Funny . Nice to see you have a sense of humor , Count . It ’ll make the week go faster . ”
12167	12208	12209	12209	She	50	“ Glad you approve . I ’ll make the arrangements and we ’ll leave tomorrow evening . I ’ll give you the rundown on my family during the trip , and you can tell me the important things about yours . ”
12830	12836	12837	12837	She	50	“ Studying for your shoot ? ”
12944	12968	12933	12933	her	50	“ Sorry , darlin ’ , pictures are all I can handle . Too many words on a page makes me all aflutter . ”
13069	13082	13055	13055	He	53	“ Nothing wrong with Vogue . It was my sister ’s bible . ”
13083	13096	13097	13097	He	53	“ I read , too . The articles in Playgirl are entertaining . ”
13113	13135	13097	13097	He	53	“ Why do n’t you tell me a little about your work ? How did you end up being a photographer ? ”
13183	13242	13175	13175	She	50	“ One Christmas I got a Nikon with all the trappings and was told to show up at photography camp for a week . The nanny had a vacation coming and they had no one to watch me , so off I went . The instructor was top rate and taught me a lot . I got hooked . ”
13277	13313	13314	13314	She	50	“ Sounds like you received money but no emotional support . The fashion industry is quite competitive , especially in Milan . You must be extremely talented and dedicated to be so much in demand . ”
13317	13327	13328	13328	She	50	“ I ’ve always had an eye for fashion . ”
13334	13345	13328	13328	She	50	“ Especially ones including muscled , half - naked men . ”
13359	13369	13352	13352	he	469	“ Have you ever tried to expand your focus ? ”
13383	13402	13370	13370	She	50	“ Sure . I ’ve done shoots for the Gap and Victoria ’s Secret during a dry spell . ”
13403	13419	13437	13437	his	469	“ You do n’t like to talk about yourself much , do you , cara ? ”
13487	13519	13475	13475	His	469	“ On the contrary . Ask me anything you want . Boxers or briefs ? Mets or Yankees ? Disco or hip - hop ? Hit me with your best shot . ”
13520	13527	13528	13528	She	50	“ Tell me about your parents . ”
13533	13632	13528	13528	She	50	“ My father is on his fourth wife . He loves money , hates work , and only sees me to rack up brownie points with his new wife . Seems she likes family closeness , and he ’s trying to make her happy . For now . He ’s handsome , charming , and completely empty . My mother envisions herself a celebrity and despises the fact she ’s aging and has two grown children . She ’s currently shacked up with an actor and begging for two - bit parts as an extra on various sets . ”
13633	13638	13639	13639	His	473	“ And your relationships ? ”
13650	13670	13639	13639	His	473	“ What about them , la mia tigrotta ? Have you given up on commitment because of your parents ? ”
13683	13694	13679	13679	she	474	“ I have many healthy relationships on my own terms . ”
13705	13774	13695	13695	She	474	“ Do I believe finding real love in this lifetime is almost impossible ? Hell , yes . It ’s proven over and over again . Why bother ? Why dive into obvious pain and heartache unless you find someone you ’d die for ? And personally , I do n’t think he ’s out there . But I have a damn good time finding Mr. Right Now . ”
13790	13795	13796	13796	His	473	“ I ’m sorry . ”
13805	13808	13809	13809	she	474	“ Why ? ”
13812	13874	13809	13809	she	474	“ I was n’t beaten , starved , or abused . I grew up in a mansion with nannies , cooks , and any toy I asked for . I do what I want , when I want , and do n’t answer to anyone . Why on earth would you be sorry for me ? I got more than most . ”
13887	13894	13881	13881	he	473	“ I feel sorrier for you . ”
13899	13902	13895	13895	Michael	53	“ Me ? ”
13903	13915	13879	13879	she	474	“ Sure . After all , I already know your secrets . ”
13935	13955	13924	13924	He	473	“ Ah , but I feel the same way . I am what you Americans call an open book . ”
13983	14041	13970	13970	She	474	“ You had a close family with plenty of support . Money and success on your own terms . And you could n’t find one woman to pretend she loves you for a lousy week . No wonder your mother is insistent on keeping to tradition . Has there been even one serious relationship in your past ? ”
14051	14055	14056	14056	he	473	“ I date , ”
14060	14078	14056	14056	he	473	“ Just because I have n’t found The One yet does n’t mean I ’m closed off . ”
14079	14106	14107	14107	He	473	“ Nice recovery . So what are you looking for , Count ? What type of woman gets you all hot and bothered to settle down ? ”
14123	14138	14139	14139	he	473	“ I ’d love to settle down and give my mother what she wants , ”
14143	14180	14139	14139	he	473	“ But not at my expense . You see , cara , I believe in the love you say is impossible . I just believe it ’s hard to find , and I refuse to compromise . ”
14181	14212	14213	14213	His	473	“ So all these women you take to your bed , do you seduce them for the challenge , the pleasure , or because you hope she ’s The One ? ”
14246	14270	14271	14271	Her	478	“ I hope . I take them to bed , concentrate on their pleasure , and hope in the morning I want more . ”
14365	14376	14377	14377	His	473	“ You experience it , too , do n’t you ? ”
14384	14448	14377	14377	His	473	“ Do you take them to bed to escape the loneliness , hoping it will end up to be more ? Do you wake up in the morning with a sick feeling in your stomach , knowing you lied to yourself again ? Do you wonder if you ’re meant to be alone ? Wonder if something deep down is holding you back ? ”
14587	14607	14577	14577	she	478	“ Sorry , Count . I take them to bed because they look good . But thanks for sharing . ”
14672	14686	14687	14687	She	478	“ I see . We shall play by the rules then , yes ? ”
14735	14758	14726	14727	the pilot	488	“ Sir , we are due to touch down at Orio al Serio within fifteen minutes . Please fasten your seat belts . ”
14764	14770	14771	14771	They	487	“ Thank you , Richard . ”
15342	15354	15319	15319	He	53	“ We shall have a minute before they come running out . ”
15355	15368	15369	15369	He	53	“ It ’s beautiful , but not the billionaire mansion I expected . ”
15385	15425	15369	15369	He	53	“ Mama refuses to leave . I planned to build her a castle worthy of what she accomplished , but she laughed at me . Said she refused to leave her family land and the home where Papa lived . ”
15426	15432	15479	15479	Her	524	“ I like her already . ”
15433	15463	15464	15464	He	523	“ She even refused help . No maids or cooks for Mama . I have a woman who sneaks in to do deep cleaning when she ’s in church . ”
15469	15478	15464	15464	He	523	“ Ah , well . Are you ready ? ”
15609	15616	15617	15617	she	524	“ Let ’s rock and roll , ”
15688	15698	15674	15674	He	523	“ You are all more beautiful than I remembered . ”
15832	15841	15817	15817	She	56	“ Is this how you wooed your bride ? ”
15845	15880	15817	15817	She	56	“ Corny compliments and sweet smiles in an effort to placate us ? Though you do n’t come to visit for months , and then spring a new wife on Mama without any buildup . ”
15900	15907	15908	15908	he	523	“ Watch your temper , Venezia , ”
15911	15929	15908	15908	he	523	“ Perhaps my wife understands better than you that I do what is best for the family . ”
15966	16001	16002	16002	She	50	“ I ’m Maggie , by the way , your brother ’s new wife . And no , he did n’t woo me with compliments . He did it the old - fashioned way . ”
16017	16022	16002	16002	She	50	“ With great sex . ”
16127	16137	16151	16151	her	539	“ Nothing wrong with sex to enslave a man . ”
16157	16179	16151	16151	her	539	“ It ’s what you do with him afterward that counts . At least you married him and made him honest . ”
16180	16183	16184	16184	Everyone	1789	“ Mama ? ”
16344	16356	16339	16339	Maggie	50	“ Signora Conte , I am honored to finally meet you . ”
16374	16394	16364	16364	she	50	“ Your son is an idiot for not telling you about our engagement sooner . I apologize for him . ”
16399	16410	16364	16364	she	50	“ I accept your apology . Welcome to my family . ”
16422	16441	16411	16412	His mother	235	“ You are too thin . Always too thin these young girls . We shall fix that immediately . ”
16448	16459	16442	16442	Her	235	“ Girls ? Did you not greet your new sister ? ”
16497	16502	16493	16493	her	235	“ Hello , Mama . ”
16503	16518	16519	16519	He	546	“ Michael . I am angry with you but will make you pay later . ”
16530	16543	16519	16519	He	546	“ Mi dispiace . I promise to make it up to you . ”
16544	16553	16554	16554	His	546	“ Si . Come inside and get settled . ”
16900	16913	16921	16921	she	50	“ Maggie , I need to speak with you for a moment . ”
16937	16946	16932	16932	He	544	“ Bring your luggage up to your room , ”
16951	16976	16932	16932	He	544	“ I ’ve gotten it ready for you . After you settle , we shall meet in the garden for some coffee and snacks . ”
16977	16980	16981	16981	He	544	“ Si . ”
17034	17061	17062	17062	He	544	“ A very amusing opening to our week , la mia tigrotta . But I think it ’s time you realize who makes the rules here . ”
17072	17075	17062	17062	He	544	“ Now . ”
17262	17275	17276	17276	He	544	“ What ’s the matter , Count ? Cat got your tongue ? ”
17320	17343	17344	17344	Maggie	50	“ Be careful , cara . Toying with me may be fun , but eventually I will tire and force your hand . ”
17347	17417	17418	17418	She	50	“ You sound like those erotic romances I love . But I ’m no sub , baby , and you ’re not my dom . My gamble paid off . I figured I ’d challenge your family from the start so I do n’t have to play a role I ’m not comfortable with . Eventually they ’d realize I ’m not a great pleaser or traditional Italian wife . ”
17421	17428	17418	17418	She	50	“ Your mom ’s a pisser . ”
17429	17439	17497	17497	His	583	“ She ’s ill , so please be careful . ”
17440	17453	17454	17454	He	583	“ Oh , no , Michael . What ’s wrong with her ? ”
17467	17496	17461	17461	his	583	“ Besides an arthritic knee , her heart is delicate . She needs to watch her stress and activity , so I intend to humor her this visit . ”
17501	17510	17497	17497	His	583	“ And I hope you will , too . ”
17511	17520	17454	17454	He	583	“ I can play nice for a week . ”
17521	17531	17532	17532	he	583	“ I ’ll believe it when I see it , ”
17535	17550	17532	17532	he	583	“ Be sure you do n’t try to deck me when I kiss you . ”
17562	17583	17584	17584	She	50	“ In fact , perhaps I should kiss you right here . Right now . For practice , of course . ”
17593	17606	17584	17584	She	50	“ I can manage not to jump when a man touches me . ”
17607	17613	17614	17614	He	583	“ I ’m not convinced . ”
17632	17657	17626	17626	his	583	“ One slipup and this charade ends . I ca n’t afford it . Especially when a simple kiss beforehand may make the difference . ”
17658	17667	17668	17668	She	50	“ I ’m real good at faking it . ”
17708	17732	17696	17696	him	583	“ No one will ever know I ’m not interested in kissing you . No need to put ourselves through a practice run . ”
17744	17754	17755	17755	He	583	“ Let ’s test the theory , shall we ? ”
17822	17830	17814	17814	His	583	“ Take your hands off of me . ”
17876	17884	17888	17888	his	583	“ What are you so nervous about ? ”
17891	17902	17888	17888	his	583	“ You ’ve done this a million times , remember ? ”
17903	17912	17913	17913	she	50	“ I do n’t like to be manhandled , ”
17936	17948	17921	17921	He	583	“ Maybe you have n’t had the right man handling you . ”
17949	17982	17983	17983	His	583	“ Give me a break . Do women really fall for that line ? Because if they do , they must come from the land of the stupid . Take your hands — ”
18295	18300	18301	18301	he	583	“ You ’re right , ”
18305	18312	18301	18301	he	583	“ You fake it really well . ”
18331	18335	18325	18325	She	50	“ Told you . ”
18354	18374	18336	18336	He	583	“ There ’s plenty of space for both of us . This will be our room for the week . ”
18526	18530	18531	18531	He	592	“ Nice bed . ”
18536	18554	18533	18533	his	592	“ Is this acceptable ? If not , I can always put a blanket on the floor . ”
18560	18581	18555	18555	She	50	“ I ’m a big girl , Count , just stay on your side . I ’ll take the left . ”
18582	18587	18533	18533	his	592	“ As you wish . ”
18588	18597	18604	18604	his	592	“ You do n’t snore , do you ? ”
18607	18616	18604	18604	his	592	“ I ’ve never had anyone complain before . ”
18617	18633	18634	18634	He	592	“ Well , I ’ll let you know for future reference if they ’re lying . ”
18648	18687	18634	18634	He	592	“ Why do n’t you take some time to freshen up and come downstairs when you ’re ready ? I ’ll show you the property and the rest of the house then . When is your Milan shoot ? ”
18688	18700	18604	18604	his	592	“ Tomorrow . I ’ll be there most of the day . ”
18701	18761	18762	18762	Maggie	50	“ Very well . I ’ll meet you there in the afternoon so we can file our Atto Notorio and Nulla Osta at the consulate ’s office . I ’ve already arranged for witnesses . Do n’t forget to bring all your papers — I had to pull some strings so Mama would n’t suspect we wish any delay . ”
18767	18783	18762	18762	Maggie	50	“ I thought you said it was impossible to get a priest to marry us ? ”
18784	18822	18762	18762	Maggie	50	“ It is quite difficult to get a priest to perform a ceremony last minute , and Mama will only accept this type of wedding . There ’s no way they can be approved in a week . ”
18823	18826	18762	18762	Maggie	50	“ Okay . ”
18953	18960	18961	18961	She	50	“ Maggie ? Are you okay ? ”
18973	18988	18989	18989	He	597	“ Sure . I ’m going to shower . I ’ll meet you downstairs . ”
19458	19463	19464	19464	she	50	“ I enjoyed this , ”
19468	19476	19464	19464	she	50	“ Maybe we can do it again . ”
19508	19521	19502	19502	He	613	“ I do n’t think that ’s a good idea , Maggie . ”
19549	19580	19543	19543	Rejection	88	“ I ’m sorry , cara . You ’re a beautiful woman , and I ’m extremely attracted to you . But I think this could end up a mess . ”
19715	19724	19725	19725	she	50	“ It ’s Alexa , is n’t it ? ”
19728	19735	19725	19725	she	50	“ You have feelings for her . ”
19736	19747	19748	19748	His	613	“ No ! Alexa is my friend , nothing else . ”
19887	19891	19892	19892	she	50	“ I understand , ”
19922	19940	19910	19910	she	50	“ Maggie , let ’s talk about this . Please do n’t go with the wrong impression . ”
19949	19988	19989	19989	He	621	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , Count . I ’m a big girl — I can handle a little rejection . As long as you realize I ’ll be keeping an eye on you . Especially around Alexa . ”
19999	20004	19989	19989	He	621	“ I told you — ”
20005	20008	20009	20009	She	50	“ Bullshit . ”
20025	20031	20021	20021	Her	50	“ See ya , Count . ”
20312	20319	20320	20320	She	50	“ Margherita , come join us . ”
20363	20366	20367	20367	Michael	53	“ Grazie . ”
20437	20447	20432	20432	She	50	“ Would you like to know how we met ? ”
20476	20520	20521	20521	Maggie	50	“ My close friend Alexa set us up on a blind date . You see , my best friend is happily married to my brother . When she met Michael at a business dinner , she thought we ’d be a perfect match . ”
20537	20571	20534	20534	his	53	“ The moment we met , he told me I was The One . Usually , I never believe men on the first date , but he courted me and won me over . ”
20583	20593	20576	20576	her	103	“ That ’s so romantic . Almost like Fate . ”
20594	20601	20602	20602	Maggie	50	“ Yes , just like Fate . ”
20608	20664	20602	20602	Maggie	50	“ We were going to set a wedding date , but when we heard Venezia was also engaged , we decided to elope . I hope you ’re not too upset we skipped a full - fledged wedding , but I despise being the center of attention , so we thought this would be best . ”
20685	20695	20696	20696	Michael	53	“ Si , Maggie is a very private person . ”
20775	20783	20784	20784	Julietta	58	“ What do you do , Maggie ? ”
20835	20858	20822	20822	Julietta	58	“ I ’m a photographer . I have a shoot tomorrow in Milan so I ’ll be gone most of the day . ”
20859	20868	20869	20869	Julietta	58	“ How wonderful . What do you photograph ? ”
20872	20879	20869	20869	Julietta	58	“ Men . In their underwear . ”
20890	20906	20887	20887	Maggie	50	“ It ’s designer underwear , of course . I ’m shooting Roberto Cavalli tomorrow . ”
20912	20933	20907	20907	Venezia	56	“ I love it ! Can you get me a discount ? Dominick would love a new pair of Cavallis . ”
20946	20962	20963	20963	She	54	“ Venezia , we do not need to know what Dominick wears under his clothes . ”
20966	20982	20963	20963	She	54	“ And you should not know , either , until you are married . Capisce ? ”
20983	20991	20992	20992	Michael	53	“ Maggie is a very gifted photographer , ”
20995	21015	20992	20992	Michael	53	“ I ’m certain she will be broadening her experience , especially with so much to see in Italy . ”
21193	21206	21207	21207	Venezia	56	“ We ’d like to hold the wedding here on the grounds , ”
21214	21236	21210	21210	Her	56	“ Of course , we ’ll have it catered with cake from our bakery . September is such a beautiful month . ”
21240	21247	21237	21237	Julietta	58	“ That ’s three months away ! ”
21254	21314	21248	21249	Her sister	304	“ I do n’t want to wait another minute to start my life with Dominick . Now that Michael is married , we can move ahead with our plans . We ’ve already decided on the fifteenth . That ’s okay with your schedule , right , Maggie ? And of course you ’ll be one of my bridesmaids . ”
21336	21346	21326	21326	She	50	“ Of course , I ’ll clear my schedule . ”
21357	21374	21347	21347	Venezia	56	“ Wonderful . Oh , and why do n’t we shop for our dresses this week ? ”
21380	21386	21375	21375	Julietta	58	“ I detest dress shopping . ”
21387	21415	21375	21375	Julietta	58	“ Well , get over it . You ’re my maid of honor and if you ruin it by whining I ’ll never talk to you again . ”
21416	21422	21375	21375	Julietta	58	“ I could only wish . ”
21448	21475	21436	21436	She	50	“ Um , I ’ll be busy with work , and I know Michael wanted to show me some of the sights while we ’re here . ”
21489	21534	21476	21476	She	50	“ Maybe you and your sisters can go this week . If you find something , I ’ll give you my size and you can order it . I ’m sure I ’ll see the dresses when Michael and I come back to visit . ”
21535	21539	21540	21540	Venezia	56	“ Absolutely not . ”
21548	21585	21586	21586	Julietta	58	“ You are also my sister now , and you must come . Besides , I refuse to put you in something that does n’t look good . It would ruin my reputation as a stylist . ”
21589	21616	21586	21586	Julietta	58	“ Maggie and I are on our honeymoon , and we need some alone time . Traipsing around dress shopping is not my idea of romance . ”
21641	21648	21649	21649	she	103	“ Oh , please join us , ”
21652	21677	21649	21649	she	103	“ We ’re a family now , and we missed out on all the excitement of your wedding . It ’s only one afternoon . ”
21789	21799	21800	21800	She	50	“ No , Michael , your sisters are right . ”
21806	21822	21800	21800	She	50	“ I would love to spend an afternoon dress shopping . It ’ll be fun . ”
21908	21911	21912	21912	Maggie	50	“ Party ? ”
21945	21980	21938	21938	her	54	“ Si . The party tonight , Michael . You did not believe I would miss holding a celebration in my son and new wife ’s honor ? We must get started on dinner . ”
21981	21986	21987	21987	Carina	103	“ Is Max coming ? ”
21994	22007	21987	21987	Carina	103	“ Si , of course he is coming . And your cousins . ”
22048	22076	22077	22077	She	103	“ Mama , we are really not up for a party tonight . We had a long flight , and Maggie has to work in the morning . ”
22089	22142	22077	22077	She	103	“ Nonsense . It is only a few people to extend their congratulations . It is nothing . Why do n’t you pull some wine from our cellar and visit the home bakery site ? Bring tiramisu and cannolis , black and white . Julietta will go with you for the ride . ”
22146	22153	22077	22077	She	103	“ Um , maybe I should — ”
22183	22199	22157	22157	her	54	“ Niente . You stay with me , Margherita , and help me with dinner . ”
22205	22230	22202	22202	his	53	“ Mama , Maggie does not cook . In the States , most women work and many do not know how to prepare food . ”
22245	22255	22256	22256	She	50	“ Screw you , Count , I can cook . ”
22262	22280	22256	22256	She	50	“ I just pretended not to know how so you ’d take me to dinner more often . ”
22552	22558	22559	22559	she	50	“ What are we making ? ”
22565	22598	22559	22559	she	50	“ Pasta . We shall eat a quick dinner before the rest of the family arrives , then put out pastries and coffee . You know how to cook pasta , Margherita ? ”
22642	22646	22639	22639	Maggie	50	“ Of course . ”
22656	22672	22639	22639	Maggie	50	“ Good . We need a few batches . I ’ve already gotten the ingredients . ”
22746	22769	22795	22795	she	670	“ I am sure you cook pasta differently in America , so you may watch me first , then prepare your batch . ”
22917	22926	22911	22912	Mama Conte	54	“ You may begin when you are ready . ”
23471	23475	23459	23459	her	50	“ I lied . ”
23489	23526	23485	23485	Maggie	50	“ I have no idea how to cook . I use the dried pasta and dump it in water . I heat up sauce in the microwave . I eat take - out almost every night . ”
23549	23553	23554	23554	Maggie	50	“ I know . ”
23558	23561	23554	23554	Maggie	50	“ What ? ”
23562	23610	23615	23616	Mama Conte	54	“ I wanted to see how far you would go . I am impressed , Margherita . You never show your fear . Once you commit , you see it through , even if you think you will fail . That is exactly what my son needs . ”
23635	23643	23615	23616	Mama Conte	54	“ We begin again . Watch me . ”
23779	23811	23772	23773	Mama Conte	54	“ The earthiness of pasta dough is the true element in a good , simple meal . We must stretch it to a delicate thinness without breaking . Work the edge . ”
23817	23828	23772	23773	Mama Conte	54	“ Mama Conte , maybe you should do this one ? ”
23829	23877	23881	23881	her	54	“ No . You will serve your husband dinner tonight , Margherita , by your own hand . And this is not because you are beneath him , or he believes you are less . It is because you are more . So much more . Capisce ? ”
23908	23911	23890	23890	She	50	“ Okay . ”
23991	23994	23984	23984	Her	54	“ Perfecto . ”
24278	24287	24272	24272	He	53	“ Ah , Mama , it is delicious . ”
24298	24318	24293	24293	herself	54	“ You may thank your wife , Michael . Each noodle on your plate was made by her hand . ”
24405	24425	24426	24426	She	50	“ Grazie , cara . I am honored to eat something you made for me . It is delicioso . ”
24945	24952	24955	24955	Brianna	100	“ How did you do it ? ”
24975	24978	24960	24960	She	100	“ cancer . ”
24989	25004	25005	25005	Maggie	50	“ Michael has avoided marriage forever . He has a reputation , you know . ”
25010	25018	25005	25005	Maggie	50	“ Really ? What type of reputation ? ”
25037	25076	25026	25026	Michael	53	“ He loves the chase . Seems he likes to seduce a woman — the bigger the challenge the more skilled he becomes in gaining her affection . Then , as soon as she gives in , wham . ”
25081	25087	25077	25077	Maggie	50	“ Wham ? What wham ? ”
25092	25105	25077	25077	Maggie	50	“ He leaves her flat . Heartbroken , seduced , and abandoned . ”
25189	25206	25184	25184	Maggie	50	“ How horrible ! Maybe that ’s why he married me , then . How strange . ”
25212	25232	25207	25207	Brianna	100	“ What ’s strange ? Tell me . We ’re family now — your secrets are safe with me . ”
25258	25273	25248	25248	Her	50	“ I refused to sleep with him until he married me , of course . ”
25971	25978	25979	25979	Michael	53	“ Maggie , there you are , ”
25982	26021	25979	25979	Michael	53	“ Meet my friend Max Gray . He ’s been like a part of our family for years , so I consider him my brother . He works for La Dolce Famiglia as my right - hand man . ”
26231	26241	26242	26242	He	96	“ Where have you been hiding her , Michael ? ”
26257	26304	26242	26242	He	96	“ Here I am thinking of you as my best friend , yet I did n’t have a clue you two were involved . When Page Six does n’t break the news about a hot single billionaire in New York getting hitched , something ’s up . ”
26321	26354	26318	26318	Michael	53	“ Seems the magazines are more interested in you than me , my friend . And I thought the last time we compared notes , you beat me by almost a million . ”
26355	26358	26318	26318	Michael	53	“ Two . ”
26359	26369	26318	26318	Michael	53	“ Ah , but you are not a count . ”
26370	26391	26392	26392	Maggie	50	“ That Swiss blood took me out of the running , I guess . But I still own more land . ”
26397	26415	26394	26394	her	50	“ Why do n’t you both whip it out and I ’ll tell you who ’s bigger ? ”
26430	26444	26445	26445	Michael	53	“ If my sources are correct , you ’re keeping your own secrets , ”
26448	26476	26445	26445	Michael	53	“ What ’s this in the gossip columns about you dating royalty ? Italian descent not good enough ? You need a blue blood to satisfy you ? ”
26482	26527	26479	26479	his	96	“ Serena accompanied her father on a business trip and is keeping me company . She ’s an heiress to a fortune , and not really royalty . Her papa would rip me apart — I’m not worthy enough to marry into that family . ”
26533	26556	26557	26557	Max	96	“ That ’s ridiculous ! Anyone who marries for money instead of love deserves unhappiness ! You ’re worth more than that . ”
26565	26584	26559	26559	his	96	“ Ah , cara , will you marry me ? You are a woman after my own heart . ”
26678	26730	26658	26658	He	53	“ Carina has many years before she can be serious about a man . She will be stepping into her rightful position in the bakery and will finish her business degree . Besides , she ’s a good girl , and you , my friend , only date the bad ones . ”
26772	26781	26782	26782	she	103	“ I ’m not a child , Michael , ”
26785	26794	26795	26795	She	103	“ Why ca n’t you both see that ? ”
26803	26809	26810	26810	Michael	53	“ What did I say ? ”
26813	26820	26810	26810	Michael	53	“ I was only teasing her . ”
26841	26851	26827	26827	Maggie	50	“ You two boneheads really did it this time . ”
26852	26871	26872	26872	Max	96	“ Did what ? Her behavior is irrational and rude to our guests . I meant no harm . ”
26876	26884	26872	26872	Max	96	“ Should I go talk to her ? ”
26885	26899	26900	26900	Maggie	50	“ No , it ’s my responsibility . I will talk to her . ”
26910	26931	26900	26900	Maggie	50	“ Ah , hell , stay out of it . You ’ve done enough . I ’ll talk to her . ”
26938	26971	26932	26932	Michael	53	“ Darling , you do n’t have much experience with young women . Sometimes she needs a firm hand to see reason . Maybe it will be better if I get Julietta . ”
27044	27051	27052	27052	She	50	“ Do n’t worry , darling . ”
27064	27080	27052	27052	She	50	“ I ’m going to give her some good news to make her feel better . ”
27081	27085	27086	27086	She	50	“ What news ? ”
27102	27117	27086	27086	She	50	“ I ’ll fix her up on a blind date . With someone hot . ”
27123	27136	27086	27086	She	50	“ Absolutely not . My baby sister is not experienced with dating . ”
27137	27152	27153	27153	She	50	“ That ’s exactly why this will be perfect for her . See ya . ”
27186	27206	27182	27182	she	50	“ Let ’s not argue on our honeymoon , love , when we can concentrate on other fun activities . ”
27405	27430	27395	27395	She	50	“ Carina ? It ’s Maggie . Do you want to talk for a bit , or do you want me to go away ? ”
27468	27478	27458	27458	Relief	106	“ Okay , I understand , I ’ll just — ”
27488	27501	27502	27503	the girl	785	“ Why does n’t anyone understand I ’m a grown - up ? ”
27531	27541	27542	27542	Maggie	50	“ Because your older brother will never accept it , ”
27712	27718	27724	27724	her	50	“ I hate my life . ”
27740	27769	27773	27773	herself	50	“ No one understands or lets me make my own decisions . I ’m not a baby anymore , but my life is already mapped out for me . ”
27793	27799	27800	27800	Carina	103	“ Um , how so ? ”
27803	27832	27800	27800	Carina	103	“ I ’m only allowed to date boys my family approves of . Not that any boys have ever asked me out . I ’m ugly and fat . ”
27840	27875	27800	27800	Carina	103	“ That ’s stupid . Your body is naturally curvy . You have breasts . Have you seen your sisters ? They may be rail thin , but their boobs are flat as pancakes . ”
27893	27923	27890	27890	her	785	“ Maybe . But boys like thin . And my hair looks like I stuck a finger in a socket . My lips look puffy and swollen and stupid . ”
27930	27999	27890	27890	her	785	“ And Michael says I have to help Julietta at La Dolce Famiglia , but he never asked me what I want ! I wanted to go away to college but he made me study at the university . Now I have to get my MBA and then do a long internship . Why ca n’t I go to America and work for him ? Nothing ’s fair ! ”
28068	28076	28060	28060	she	50	“ Okay , babe , sit up . ”
28133	28147	28154	28154	she	103	“ I ’m sure you ’ve heard this before , but life sucks . ”
28159	28192	28154	28154	she	103	“ Look , I know we do n’t know each other well , but let me tell you what I see . Max is smoking hot and you ’re crazy about him . ”
28205	28216	28199	28199	Her	103	“ N - n - no , I do n’t — ”
28227	28257	28217	28217	Maggie	50	“ I do n’t blame you . The problem is you recently passed legal drinking age . You ’re practically jailbait to a thirty - year - old man . ”
28258	28263	28199	28199	Her	103	“ What ’s that ? ”
28264	28335	28217	28217	Maggie	50	“ Hm , never mind . I mean , you ’re too young for him to see you as a woman yet . That may change , but instead of spending the next few years not living and waiting for him to notice you , you need to get out and live a little . Find out who you are . Then everyone will see you as your own person . ”
28382	28398	28364	28364	people	284	“ How do I do that ? Look at me . I ’m a mess . ”
28399	28408	28364	28364	people	284	“ Do you like studying business in college ? ”
28409	28432	28433	28433	Her	103	“ I do n’t mind . I ’m very good with numbers — one of the few things I can do well . ”
28439	28451	28433	28433	Her	103	“ But it would be nice if someone asked my opinion . ”
28465	28491	28492	28492	She	50	“ Business and accounting are n’t bad degrees to get . You can do lots of stuff with it and meet new and interesting people . ”
28502	28508	28492	28492	She	50	“ Is that your painting ? ”
28512	28529	28509	28509	Carina	103	“ Yeah , I like to paint , but I do n’t think I ’m good . ”
28572	28579	28580	28580	she	50	“ No , you ’re good , ”
28584	28620	28580	28580	she	50	“ Do n’t ever give up on the art . Take some classes on the side to nurture your talent , and do n’t let anyone tell you that you ca n’t . Get it ? ”
28635	28679	28680	28680	Her	103	“ Michael has your best interests at heart , but as an older brother , he ’s always going to suck at this . You ’re going to need more of a backbone to let him know what is and is not acceptable . ”
28684	28692	28693	28693	she	50	“ But whatever Michael says is law , ”
28696	28704	28693	28693	she	50	“ He ’s head of the family . ”
28705	28723	28680	28680	Her	103	“ I ’m not telling you to disrespect him . Just be clear with communication . Try . ”
28724	28727	28680	28680	Her	103	“ Okay . ”
28728	28751	28693	28693	she	50	“ As for Max , maybe one day things will change . Until then , you need to concentrate on other boys . ”
28752	28763	28764	28764	Maggie	50	“ I told you , boys do n’t like me . ”
28769	28780	28764	28764	Maggie	50	“ You ’re not presenting yourself to your full potential . ”
28803	28817	28798	28798	Maggie	50	“ Why do n’t you come with me to my shoot this week ? ”
28825	28828	28818	28819	The girl	785	“ Why ? ”
28832	28890	28892	28892	she	50	“ I ’ll give you a makeover . Show you the world of photography and introduce you to some of the models . It wo n’t fix your problems , but maybe you can see how other people view you . You ’re beautiful , Carina . Inside and out . You just need to believe it . ”
28967	28973	28957	28957	she	50	“ You would do that ? ”
28974	28982	28985	28985	her	103	“ Sure . It ’ll be fun . ”
29009	29027	28985	28985	her	103	“ Thanks , Maggie . You ’re the best sister - in - law in the world ! ”
29028	29041	29000	29000	Maggie	50	“ I ’m your only sister - in - law , babe . ”
29096	29099	29085	29085	Maggie	50	“ Grazie ! ”
29100	29103	29104	29104	She	50	“ Prego . ”
29252	29264	29265	29265	he	53	“ You did not even ask permission before you invited her , ”
29269	29283	29265	29265	he	53	“ Do not disrespect me with matters of my own family , Maggie . ”
29337	29381	29319	29319	Her	818	“ Hm , I do n’t think the word ‘ obey ’ was in our vows , Michael . Anyway , I told you I was kidding about the blind date thing . At least you do n’t have to worry about that . ”
29382	29388	29389	29389	She	818	“ This is not funny . ”
29392	29436	29389	29389	She	818	“ Listen , I had no choice . She was hysterical , and I needed to calm her down . If you had n’t treated her like a five - year - old , maybe I would n’t have had to do it . ”
29437	29451	29452	29452	She	818	“ Carina is an innocent and I intend to keep her that way . ”
29460	29497	29452	29452	She	818	“ Wake up and smell the coffee , Count . She ’s on the edge of exploring her sexuality . She ’s gon na do it anyway , and we might as well be her guides . ”
29498	29532	29389	29389	She	818	“ Not under my roof . I have a duty to protect her and I will . She needs to finish college and start her career . Boys are not in the picture . ”
29533	29540	29389	29389	She	818	“ She ’s hot for Max . ”
29541	29544	29545	29545	His	818	“ What ? ”
29552	29567	29545	29545	His	818	“ Did he do something to lead her on ? I ’ll kill him . ”
29568	29614	29615	29615	He	818	“ Geez , calm down . He did n’t do anything . He sees her as a child , too . I ’m just trying to tell you to cut her some slack . It ’s not easy crushing on your brother ’s best friend . ”
29658	29671	29677	29677	him	818	“ Max is family and Carina would never view him like that . ”
29679	29697	29677	29677	him	818	“ Why ? Are you attracted to him ? Did you put these ideas in her head ? ”
29723	29772	29773	29773	She	825	“ Contrary to your opinion of me , Count , I do n’t come on to every man I see . And Carina is capable of making up her own mind . You just have to get your head out of your ass and actually listen to her . ”
29798	29809	29810	29810	he	818	“ You are on dangerous ground , la mia tigrotta , ”
29813	29849	29810	29810	he	818	“ I will not have any interference from you this week with my family . You are not taking Carina to this shoot , and I will handle this problem with her myself . Capisce ? ”
29882	29921	29932	29932	She	601	“ I have no interest in messing with your family . Go ahead and play dictator if it makes you happy . I ’m trying to tell you your sister needs a listening ear , not a lecture . ”
29922	29931	29932	29932	She	601	“ And you are the convenient listening ear ? ”
29938	29949	29932	29932	She	601	“ Guess so . Lucky I ’m here , huh ? ”
30093	30112	30113	30113	he	818	“ You put bad ideas in a young girl ’s head . I take care of my own , ”
30116	30158	30113	30113	he	818	“ One lousy day and you ’ve already made a mess of things . You do n’t know what my sister needs . You do n’t know what anyone needs . Hell , you do n’t even know what you need . ”
30250	30257	30258	30258	she	601	“ You ’re right of course , ”
30261	30283	30258	30258	she	601	“ I ’ll stay out of things from now on . But I ’m not telling her she ca n’t go . ”
30305	30312	30313	30313	he	818	“ I ’m sorry , cara , ”
30317	30338	30313	30313	he	818	“ I did n’t mean to say such a nasty thing . You bring out the beast in me sometimes . ”
30352	30360	30346	30346	she	601	“ Accepted . Now let me go . ”
30393	30412	30386	30386	She	601	“ Seems like the beast side is pretty happy to see me . Insulting me turns you on ? ”
30462	30468	30457	30457	He	818	“ all bark and no bite ”
30481	30511	30512	30512	Her	601	“ No , cara , you seem to turn me on . As you are well aware . What I need from you now is just to hold you . ”
30528	30553	30516	30516	her	601	“ Trust me , Count , I ’ve heard much worse and was never bothered . I do n’t need you to hold me . ”
30554	30564	30565	30565	he	818	“ No , I need you to hold me , ”
30568	30583	30565	30565	he	818	“ You deserved more than that cheap shot and I need to feel better . ”
30594	30610	30584	30584	She	601	“ Shhh , just for a moment , I promise it wo n’t hurt much . ”
31215	31218	31219	31219	she	601	“ More , ”
31222	31227	31219	31219	she	601	“ Give me more . ”
31329	31332	31316	31316	he	53	“ Michael ! ”
31359	31369	31370	31370	Venezia	56	“ Are you guys doing anything naughty in there ? ”
31374	31391	31370	31370	Venezia	56	“ If so , save it for later . I need you downstairs for a minute . ”
31395	31404	31370	31370	Venezia	56	“ Michael , Maggie ? Are you there ? ”
31424	31437	31370	31370	Venezia	56	“ I ’m here . I ’ll be down in a minute . ”
31438	31441	31370	31370	Venezia	56	“ Grazie . ”
31511	31547	31505	31505	she	50	“ Next time you want to cop a feel , just be honest . I ’m not one of these women who needs to wrap sex up in a warm , fluffy cocoon of emotions . ”
31548	31551	31559	31559	her	50	“ Maggie — ”
31552	31556	31557	31557	She	50	“ Do n’t ! ”
31585	31597	31579	31579	she	50	“ Please . Not tonight . Go talk to your sister . ”
31763	31771	31772	31772	Michael	53	“ So who are we meeting again ? ”
31881	31900	31877	31877	she	50	“ Signore Ballini . He owns many restaurants and may be open to partnering with La Dolce Famiglia . ”
31916	31930	31931	31931	She	50	“ He has heard about my marriage and insists on meeting my wife . ”
32006	32017	32018	32018	She	50	“ Need me to help close the deal , Count ? ”
32026	32039	32018	32018	She	50	“ Want me to sing your praises and play the doting wife ? ”
32074	32108	32069	32069	Maggie	50	“ I ’ll pass . Signore Ballini is a bit conservative , and I ’m looking to make an impression . Perhaps you can play the part of the doting , silent wife ? ”
32109	32114	32118	32118	her	50	“ Dare to dream . ”
32181	32219	32178	32178	Maggie	50	“ Nick would go crazy here . The balance of nature with man - made objects always calls to him . Bergamo has such deep character . I can see how happy you were here growing up . ”
32223	32274	32178	32178	Maggie	50	“ Si . I adore living in America but must admit I ’d never give up my childhood . Alexa would love it here , too . We host a very famous poetry event each year called Bergamo Poesia . Perhaps we can arrange a trip for them one day ? ”
32296	32320	32286	32286	she	50	“ Hm , convenient . Get her on your home turf with the lure of poetry . Just remember our deal , Count . ”
32546	32575	32641	32643	The older man	840	“ Signora , since you are from America , I am sure you have a career . Tell me what you do besides make Michael a happy man ? ”
32617	32623	32624	32624	she	50	“ I ’m a photographer , ”
32627	32640	32641	32643	The older man	840	“ I ’ve loved being behind the camera since I was young . ”
32648	32658	32641	32643	The older man	840	“ Do you shoot landscapes ? Babies ? Weddings ? ”
32659	32699	32700	32700	Michael	53	“ Underwear for Calvin Klein , Cavalli , and many other well - known stylists . I fly to Milan often on business , so it was a wonderful opportunity to combine both business and pleasure on this trip . ”
32712	32729	32730	32730	She	50	“ How refreshing . It is good to make your husband a bit jealous , no ? ”
32826	32846	32847	32848	Signore Ballini	107	“ I am trying to arrange a skiing trip in Aspen and having a terrible time with a villa , ”
32851	32891	32847	32848	Signore Ballini	107	“ That awful American actress who owns a home there wo n’t return my calls . I read she will rent out her home to only the best . I guess an Italian is not good enough for her . ”
32899	32907	32908	32908	she	50	“ Are you talking about Shelly Rikers ? ”
32920	32938	32914	32916	the older man	840	“ Yes . I refuse to watch any more of her movies . She is quite rude . ”
32939	32951	32952	32952	Michael	53	“ Actually , I know Shelly and she ’s very personable . ”
32976	32995	32962	32963	Signore Ballini	107	“ I would not know this , signora , since obviously she only deigns to speak with Americans . ”
33024	33029	33016	33017	the man	280	“ Maybe we should — ”
33030	33045	33046	33046	She	50	“ Do n’t be silly , signore . Let me fix this for you . ”
33100	33111	33089	33089	She	50	“ Signore , is the first week in September acceptable ? ”
33117	33120	33089	33089	She	50	“ Perfecto . ”
33121	33147	33148	33148	She	50	“ Yes , that is fine . Give Shelly my love and tell her I ’ll call her when I arrive home . Thank you . ”
33159	33198	33148	33148	She	50	“ You are all set . I will make sure to give the information to Michael so you can set things up . I think it was all a misunderstanding . She is looking forward to seeing you . ”
33199	33209	33148	33148	She	50	“ Grazie . Not only beautiful , but efficient . ”
33282	33295	33296	33296	he	53	“ I thought you were going to screw that up for me , ”
33321	33364	33299	33299	Her	694	“ I know . I thought I ’d make you sweat first . It was fun watching your face while you tried to keep the conversation neutral . Did you really think I could n’t handle myself in business situations , Count ? ”
33498	33505	33506	33506	he	53	“ See that fountain over there ? ”
33509	33512	33506	33506	he	53	“ Yeah . ”
33513	33535	33536	33536	She	694	“ My friend Max and I came into the square one night and dared each other to go skinny - dipping . ”
33541	33550	33536	33536	She	694	“ No way . Did you do it ? ”
33551	33601	33506	33506	he	53	“ Max did . I bribed him to first . Bare - ass naked he stepped into the fountain and one of our neighbors was out with his dog and caught us . He chased us out of the square , but Max had to leave his clothes behind . ”
33602	33613	33536	33536	She	694	“ What was the whole point of this male escapade ? ”
33614	33625	33626	33626	She	694	“ To see who had bigger balls , of course . ”
33801	33809	33810	33810	His	872	“ Okay , Decklan . Drop ’em . ”
34533	34538	34539	34539	Maggie	50	“ You look gorgeous , ”
34551	34557	34542	34542	She	50	“ Do you like it ? ”
34562	34572	34558	34558	Carina	103	“ I ca n’t believe I look like this . ”
34576	34587	34573	34573	Maggie	50	“ I do . And I think my men agree . ”
34706	34711	34712	34712	She	50	“ Come with me . ”
34743	34763	34729	34729	she	50	“ Decklan , Roberto , Paolo , this is Carina . She ’s now in the shoot with you . ”
34764	34767	34768	34768	Carina	103	“ What ? ”
34786	34793	34771	34771	She	50	“ Cross your arms like this . ”
34809	34847	34794	34794	Maggie	50	“ Now , look out the window as if you ’re dreaming of something . Something that makes you happy . Do n’t worry , your features will be blurred and your figure in shadow . Okay ? ”
34848	34854	34872	34872	she	103	“ But I ca n’t — ”
34855	34858	34859	34859	Carina	103	“ Please ? ”
34921	34930	34931	34931	She	50	“ Listen up . Your target is her . ”
34942	34976	34977	34977	She	50	“ Imagine what it would be like to approach her , to give her her first kiss , to make her feel like a woman . That ’s what I want . Now . ”
35087	35097	35073	35073	Click	113	“ We ’re done . That ’s a wrap . ”
35238	35243	35244	35244	His	300	“ I can explain . ”
35257	35264	35244	35244	His	300	“ I ’m sure you can . ”
35380	35419	35420	35420	He	300	“ Well , I decided to treat Carina to a makeover while I worked so she would n’t have to see the models in their underwear , because I knew you would n’t be too happy about that . ”
35428	35450	35451	35451	She	50	“ And that is why I saw her on the stage with the same naked models . Because of your protection . ”
35465	35556	35422	35422	his	300	“ You did n’t let me finish . And they ’re not naked . So I was having a terrible time getting the shot I needed . Then Carina came out , and she was so happy about her appearance , and so much more confident . . . the men got this look on their faces , it was quite incredible , really — I’ve never seen anything so pure in this business , and I knew I had to capture the expression in order to get something fresh . ”
35557	35560	35561	35561	His	300	“ Pure ? ”
35572	35613	35614	35614	Whoa	114	“ You put my baby sister in your shot to be gawked at by strange naked men in order to capture purity ? Is this your defense , Maggie ? Would you sacrifice anything just to sell a few ads ? ”
35633	35680	35625	35625	She	912	“ They . Are . Not . Naked . You ’re twisting my words , Count . As for sacrifice , it seems I ’m willing to do a lot of that in the name of true love . Even have a fake marriage with you . ”
35693	35719	35690	35690	his	300	“ You did n’t do it for true love , cara . Do n’t ever forget you got your pound of flesh for this bargain . ”
35720	35752	35753	35753	His	300	“ Oh , yeah , so sorry I wo n’t let you pant all over my sister - in - law and make moony eyes at her from across the room . ”
35758	35804	35753	35753	His	300	“ You are crazy . I told you over and over I am not in love with Alexa . It is your delusions and need to control everything around you . And what does this have to do with Carina and your bit of exhibitionism ? ”
35805	35829	35830	35830	His	300	“ I cast her in shadow ; no one will really see her face . I would never expose her to anything inappropriate . ”
35838	35843	35830	35830	His	300	“ You already did ! ”
35844	35847	35848	35848	Carina	103	“ Michael ? ”
35884	35894	35895	35895	she	103	“ Did you see me up there , Michael ? ”
35898	35905	35895	35895	she	103	“ I was a real model . ”
35906	35913	35914	35914	His	300	“ You were wonderful , cara . ”
35922	35927	35914	35914	His	300	“ Who did this ? ”
35928	35982	35895	35895	she	103	“ I got a makeover . You should have seen Maggie work , I ’ve never been at a shoot before and it was ultracool . Now I may be in the real ad , and the models are supernice . Decklan invited me to dinner with some of the other models and — ”
35983	35987	35988	35988	His	300	“ Absolutely not . ”
35997	36037	35988	35988	His	300	“ I ’m glad you had fun , but the shoot is now over . You will not be going out with some strange men you do n’t know . Besides , you ’re babysitting for Uncle Brian tonight . ”
36090	36105	36087	36087	Carina	103	“ I babysit for Uncle Brian almost every Saturday night while other people date . ”
36114	36154	36106	36106	Michael	53	“ I will not argue with you on this point . Now be a good girl and wash your face , get back to normal , and let ’s go . We have an appointment at the consulate soon . ”
36210	36235	36236	36236	She	103	“ Why ca n’t you see I ’m not a baby and respect me ? I wish you ’d never come back to Italy ! ”
36338	36341	36322	36322	She	50	“ Michael — ”
36342	36440	36441	36441	Maggie	50	“ What did I do now ? Huh ? Is it so wrong to deny her to go off on a drunken fest with a bunch of naked male models to be lost forever ? We are one of the richest families in Italy . She ’s too young ! She could be kidnapped and ransomed . And why did she look so different ? She always babysits for Brian and said she loved doing it . Suddenly , she wants to change her routine and prowl the town so someone can kidnap her ? Absolutely not . ”
36535	36553	36554	36554	He	921	“ Well , I agree , I would n’t let her go on a drunken fest either . ”
36574	36615	36616	36616	He	921	“ Hey , it sounds like babysitting four rambunctious nephews would be a blast , but the girl got invited to dinner with a nice , handsome man and wants to go . You ca n’t blame her for asking . ”
36620	36627	36616	36616	He	921	“ You would let her go ? ”
36628	36637	36638	36638	she	50	“ I would let her go with provisions , ”
36641	36761	36762	36762	He	927	“ I do n’t know the group well enough to let her go alone , either . But I do have a close friend who could join them . She has a daughter Carina ’s age , whom I think Carina would get along with . I usually visit Sierra when I ’m in Milan , and she ’s someone I trust . I do n’t know if she ’s free today , but I can make the call . She can chaperone , and drive her home after dinner . If not , then I agree with you completely — she should n’t go alone . But at least it looks as if you are trying to compromise . ”
36766	36794	36762	36762	He	927	“ How does Mama handle her temper ? Carina is usually so calm and reserved . What ’s happening to her ? Why wo n’t she listen ? ”
36800	36814	36797	36797	her	50	“ Why are you trying so hard to keep her from growing up ? ”
36856	36865	36842	36842	She	50	“ I made a promise not to fail . ”
36891	36902	36866	36866	His	927	“ Who did you make a promise to , Michael ? ”
36903	36911	36915	36915	he	927	“ My father . Before he died . ”
36919	36927	36915	36915	he	927	“ I ’m responsible for them all . ”
37185	37202	37203	37203	she	50	“ If we do n’t let them make some mistakes , how will they ever know ? ”
37207	37222	37223	37223	She	50	“ Carina is crazy about you . She just needs a little breathing room . ”
37226	37254	37255	37255	She	50	“ Your family is lucky to have you watching over them . Now , let me make a phone call to see if we can fix this . ”
38123	38155	38112	38112	Maggie	50	“ Okay , Sierra ’s free . She can be here in a bit and drive her home tonight . You can trust her . But it ’s up to you . ”
38220	38232	38210	38210	Carina	103	“ Maggie , can I trust my sister with this woman ? ”
38252	38286	38287	38287	He	57	“ Yes . I would never put Carina in a vulnerable position where she could be hurt . I know Sierra well , and she will not let something happen to your sister . ”
38290	38301	38287	38287	He	57	“ Set it up . I ’ll talk to Carina . ”
38302	38309	38310	38310	He	57	“ Talk to me about what ? ”
38362	38373	38374	38374	he	57	“ Maggie made arrangements to have her friend chaperone you , ”
38380	38395	38377	38377	Carina	103	“ Dios ! Are you kidding me ? For real , I can go ? ”
38402	38444	38445	38445	He	57	“ There are rules . You text me and let me know where you are at all times . Sierra will be in charge and will take you home . And before you go , I have a talk with them . ”
38466	38469	38447	38447	his	53	“ Capisce ? ”
38474	38481	38470	38470	Carina	103	“ Si , grazie , Michael . ”
38492	38499	38500	38500	Maggie	50	“ They have the photos ready , ”
38633	38638	38639	38639	Maggie	50	“ That ’s it , ”
38642	38647	38639	38639	Maggie	50	“ I got it . ”
38807	38815	38798	38798	She	50	“ Can I use it , Michael ? ”
38829	38838	38839	38839	She	103	“ How did you do that , Maggie ? ”
38844	38850	38851	38851	Maggie	50	“ It ’s so beautiful . ”
38854	38875	38851	38851	Maggie	50	“ Part of my job . You ’re the star , though . You ’re the one who ’s beautiful . ”
38993	39015	38978	38978	he	53	“ She ’s right , you know . You are beautiful . And yes , Maggie , you can use it . ”
39761	39773	39758	39758	his	53	“ Buon giorno , cara . Are you enjoying your bath ? ”
39786	39810	39774	39774	She	50	“ Are you kidding me ? What are you doing here ? As most married women would state , I have a headache . ”
39818	39852	39853	39853	She	50	“ Ah , I have heard that expression before . We just uncorked one of our best bottles of pinot grigio , and I thought you ’d enjoy a sip while you soak . ”
39856	39863	39853	39853	She	50	“ Well , okay . Thanks . ”
39883	39892	39893	39893	He	53	“ You can put the plate over there . ”
39943	39949	39950	39950	He	53	“ You can go now . ”
40065	40073	40053	40053	he	53	“ What are you still doing here ? ”
40074	40081	40101	40101	his	53	“ I thought we ’d chat . ”
40082	40094	40095	40095	He	53	“ Fine . Strip off your clothes and let ’s talk . ”
40114	40120	40107	40107	he	53	“ Sure about that request ? ”
40202	40211	40198	40198	She	50	“ What do you want to talk about ? ”
40212	40216	40217	40217	Maggie	50	“ Our deal . ”
40220	40261	40217	40217	Maggie	50	“ Thought we were on course . Papers are filed so your mom knows we ’re legit . Did you see how she asked a zillion questions to make sure everything was in order ? She ’s a crafty one . ”
40262	40266	40198	40198	She	50	“ Always was . ”
40267	40279	40198	40198	She	50	“ My shoot is over . Dress shopping is behind me . ”
40280	40283	40198	40198	She	50	“ Good . ”
40284	40306	40198	40198	She	50	“ Another family dinner is Friday night , oh , and Julietta wants me to visit the bakery with you tomorrow . ”
40307	40310	40311	40311	She	50	“ Fine . ”
40314	40321	40311	40311	She	50	“ Why are you still here ? ”
40322	40328	40198	40198	She	50	“ Because I want something . ”
40329	40332	40198	40198	She	50	“ What ? ”
40333	40338	40198	40198	She	50	“ You , cara . ”
40434	40440	40431	40431	he	53	“ What did you say ? ”
40445	40458	40431	40431	he	53	“ You heard me . Here , try a bite of this . ”
40459	40468	40469	40469	He	53	“ I do n’t want a frickin ’ — ”
40617	40620	40621	40621	he	53	“ Good ? ”
40660	40665	40666	40666	His	53	“ Uh . Yeah . ”
40686	40692	40666	40666	His	53	“ What scent is this ? ”
40693	40696	40666	40666	His	53	“ Huh ? ”
40724	40727	40717	40717	his	53	“ Sandalwood . ”
40728	40755	40756	40756	She	50	“ It ’s been driving me crazy . When I finally taste you , will you remind me of earthy musk , sweet against my tongue ? ”
40837	40845	40846	40846	She	50	“ Why are you doing this now ? ”
40873	40883	40884	40884	His	280	“ Are you playing some sick game with me ? ”
40890	40902	40903	40903	he	280	“ You ’re the one playing games , la mia tigrotta , ”
40906	40947	40903	40903	he	280	“ I ’ve wanted you from day one , and I never denied it . I ’m tired of fighting with you when we can be doing other things . More pleasurable things . . . for both of us . ”
41018	41025	41026	41026	He	280	“ I need time to think . ”
41035	41042	41043	41043	He	280	“ Please hand me a towel . ”
41164	41172	41156	41156	she	50	“ Okay , I ’m ready now . ”
41628	41662	41672	41672	she	50	“ I agree with your proposition to sleep together . But since you ca n’t even speak , I ’ll go get dressed and we ’ll revisit the topic later . When you ’re more”—her
41673	41675	41672	41672	she	50	smirked—“functional . ”
41745	41752	41753	41753	he	280	“ I ’m ready , cara , ”
41756	41760	41753	41753	he	280	“ Are you ? ”
42002	42014	42015	42015	he	280	“ I ’ve been dying to sink my fingers into you , ”
42018	42025	42015	42015	he	280	“ Are you ready for me ? ”
42035	42043	42044	42044	He	280	“ You talk too much , Count . ”
42257	42260	42249	42249	his	280	“ Michael — ”
42261	42270	42271	42271	His	280	“ You talk too much yourself , cara . ”
42350	42361	42338	42338	His	280	“ Michael ! Do n’t , I ’m going to — ”
42362	42375	42376	42376	He	280	“ I want you to come . Now . Come , Maggie . ”
42554	42564	42565	42565	Her	50	“ Well , thank goodness . I needed that . ”
42615	42628	42604	42604	her	50	“ Thanks . Do you want me to take care of you ? ”
42697	42707	42708	42708	he	280	“ Do you want to take care of me ? ”
42715	42751	42712	42712	She	50	“ If you want . Tit for tat . No time for a long marathon — I promised your mom I ’d help her with dinner , so I have to get dressed . Well ? ”
42807	42816	42817	42817	he	280	“ Why are you doing this , cara ? ”
42832	42859	42828	42828	She	50	“ Sorry if I do n’t want to talk about touchy - feely things after an orgasm , Count . I thought we were past that . ”
42890	42906	42907	42907	He	280	“ You ’re right , Maggie . I thought we were past this , too . ”
42917	42946	42907	42907	He	280	“ After dinner we ’re babysitting . Since you were the one to convince Carina to break her promise to Brian , we will take over the responsibility . ”
42952	42969	42970	42970	He	280	“ Brian has four boys ! I ’m exhausted . No way am I babysitting tonight . ”
42984	43004	43005	43005	He	280	“ You will be babysitting tonight . We ’ll go after dinner . Get dressed and meet me downstairs . ”
43199	43205	43206	43206	she	50	“ Is he still hungry ? ”
43221	43237	43206	43206	she	50	“ No . Lizzie said one bottle is all he needs to get to sleep . ”
43280	43291	43292	43292	he	53	“ Do you think he needs to be burped more ? ”
43301	43322	43298	43298	She	50	“ I do n’t know . When Lily cries for too long , I just hand her back to Alexa . ”
43328	43335	43323	43323	Michael	53	“ Where are Luke and Robert ? ”
43353	43356	43349	43349	his	53	“ Playing . ”
43357	43367	43394	43394	his	53	“ I thought you put them down to bed . ”
43368	43389	43390	43390	He	53	“ I did . But they did n’t want to go to sleep so I told them they could play . ”
43406	43431	43394	43394	his	53	“ Of course they do n’t want to go to bed , Maggie . But we ’re the adults . Just tell them no . ”
43432	43463	43394	43394	his	53	“ I did . Three times . But Robert started crying because he wanted his mother , and then Luke joined in , so I told them five more minutes . ”
43491	43509	43485	43485	He	53	“ They played you big - time . Fine , keep it to books . Nothing messy . ”
43628	43637	43638	43638	She	50	“ How about Ryan ? Is he asleep ? ”
43641	43661	43662	43662	He	53	“ He kept popping up because he was thirsty . I gave him some water in that sippy thing . ”
43679	43703	43704	43704	She	50	“ Do n’t tell me this , Maggie . He wets the bed and he ’s not supposed to have liquids after seven . ”
43710	43769	43704	43704	She	50	“ You did n’t tell me that . He grabbed his stomach and said it hurt because he was so thirsty . You ’ve been in here over an hour while you left me with the sons of Satan . Let ’s switch . I ’ll put the baby to bed , and you handle the Outsiders gang . ”
43770	43774	43784	43784	She	50	“ Outsiders what ? ”
43775	43783	43784	43784	She	50	“ Oh , never mind . Here . ”
43836	43843	43829	43829	His	120	“ See , he ’s teething . ”
43872	43888	43889	43889	Maggie	50	“ Stay here . I need to get Ryan and make him go potty again . ”
44278	44281	44282	44282	Her	50	“ Maggie ! ”
44316	44319	44310	44310	she	50	“ What ? ”
44320	44332	44282	44282	Her	50	“ Did you give Luke one of those juice box things ? ”
44365	44368	44369	44369	she	50	“ Yes ! ”
44373	44391	44369	44369	she	50	“ He saw Ryan get a drink and cried , so I gave him one of those . ”
44392	44399	44343	44343	them	1063	“ Can you come in here ? ”
44431	44442	44443	44443	she	50	“ Talk to me like a human being , please , ”
44500	44509	44492	44492	Luke	118	“ Oh , my God , what happened ? ”
44520	44534	44512	44512	his	53	“ Luke . Why do n’t you tell Aunt Maggie what occurred here ? ”
44555	44560	44561	44561	he	118	“ Played rocket blaster , ”
44564	44567	44561	44561	he	118	“ See ? ”
44568	44571	44572	44572	they	1068	“ No ! ”
44616	44623	44624	44624	Michael	53	“ You are in big trouble , ”
44627	44642	44624	44624	Michael	53	“ Wait till your mother gets home and I tell her what you did . ”
44665	44672	44656	44658	Her fake husband	439	“ You think this is funny ? ”
44678	44699	44673	44673	She	64	“ Well , kind of . I mean , it ’s so bad I feel like I ’m on Punk’d . ”
44700	44713	44714	44714	She	64	“ Can you clean this up while I give Luke a bath ? ”
44720	44745	44714	44714	She	64	“ But I have the baby . He ’s quiet , and I ’m not removing my finger until it prunes and falls off . ”
44759	44771	44772	44772	She	64	“ Dios , fine . Come help with the bath then . ”
44786	44809	44778	44778	he	439	“ You guys stay right here and play until Luke is out of the bath . Then bedtime for everyone . Capisce ? ”
44810	44816	44817	44817	Robert	119	“ Yes , Uncle Michael , ”
44868	44883	44884	44884	He	439	“ So you ’re telling me your cousins do this for fun every night ? ”
44893	44920	44884	44884	He	439	“ Something tells me they are more organized than us . But yes , I am sure this is what most of their evenings are like . ”
44931	44944	44921	44921	She	64	“ What about you ? Is this what you want , too ? ”
44956	44959	44945	44945	He	439	“ Si . ”
44960	44967	44968	44968	She	64	“ Really ? All this glamour ? ”
44973	45014	44968	44968	She	64	“ Do you realize there wo n’t be any sophisticated dinners , or working late to close a deal , or jetting off to some tropical island on a moment ’s notice ? You ’d willingly give up your freedom ? ”
45051	45054	45038	45038	He	439	“ Yes . ”
45094	45100	45101	45101	They	1074	“ Hi , Uncle Michael ! ”
45178	45186	45174	45174	Michael	53	“ What did you do , Robert ? ”
45187	45198	45199	45199	he	53	“ I found this bottle in Aunt Maggie ’s purse ! ”
45204	45207	45208	45208	Maggie	64	“ Lotion ! ”
45222	45247	45213	45213	Michael	53	“ Hm . I thought I told you to put your purse on top of the refrigerator so it would n’t be a temptation . ”
45254	45302	45248	45248	She	64	“ I hid it behind the couch because I had no time ! As soon as I got through the door Lizzie and Brian shot out like their asses were on fire . Now I know why . Why would someone ever want another one after Robert ? ”
45309	45331	45303	45306	The giggling mad Joker	123	“ Ass ! Aunt Maggie said ‘ ass ’ ! Ass means butt . Ass , ass , butt , butt . ”
45340	45355	45356	45356	Michael	53	“ Use that word again and I will wash your mouth out with soap , ”
45359	45367	45356	45356	Michael	53	“ Now , get into the bath . ”
45368	45373	45400	45400	Michael	53	“ Um , Michael ? ”
45374	45377	45356	45356	Michael	53	“ What ? ”
45378	45399	45400	45400	Michael	53	“ You ’re going to have some trouble . The lotion is waterproof . Wo n’t come off for hours . ”
45448	45454	45455	45455	He	53	“ We can do this . ”
45471	45480	45455	45455	He	53	“ Can you check on Ryan for me ? ”
45541	45548	45533	45533	She	50	“ Ryan , where are you ? ”
45549	45552	45553	45553	He	53	“ Here ! ”
45584	45589	45575	45575	his	53	“ I do dough ! ”
45660	45674	45697	45697	she	50	“ You did great , buddy . Follow me ; it ’s bathtime . ”
45675	45678	45679	45679	He	53	“ Bath ! ”
45718	45729	45730	45730	Maggie	50	“ You gave them the Play - Doh , huh ? ”
45733	45766	45767	45767	She	50	“ Yep . In my defense , I thought it was child - friendly . Live and learn . Figured if we ’re all in here together , nothing else can happen . ”
45774	45777	45767	45767	She	50	“ Right ? ”
45778	45783	45788	45788	he	53	“ Let ’s pray . ”
45801	45828	45788	45788	he	53	“ I think I need help here . I ’m on the second washcloth and the lotion is only half off . Can you scrub Ryan ? ”
45829	45835	45836	45836	Thomas	120	“ What about the baby ? ”
45859	45864	45865	45865	she	50	“ Ah , gross , ”
45873	45883	45865	45865	she	50	“ Can I put him down on the ground ? ”
45884	45898	45899	45899	She	50	“ Yeah . Make sure there is n’t anything he can reach first . ”
45956	45966	45940	45940	His	53	“ Ouch , ouch . Michael , help me . ”
46021	46038	46041	46041	Michael	53	“ Oh , God , he ’s crying again . Give me the rubber ducky there . ”
46069	46073	46074	46074	Michael	53	“ Smart move , ”
46133	46149	46150	46150	Michael	53	“ Uncle Michael , who is the bestest superhero ? I think it ’s Superman . ”
46161	46179	46180	46180	Luke	118	“ Superman ’s pretty awesome because he can fly and bend steel . But I like Batman . ”
46183	46194	46180	46180	Luke	118	“ Me , too ! Batman beats up bad guys . ”
46195	46202	46203	46203	Robert	119	“ But he ca n’t fly , ”
46207	46213	46214	46214	Michael	53	“ Yes , he can , ”
46217	46241	46214	46214	Michael	53	“ He uses his equipment to fly like a bat . And he has cool gadgets and the best car in the world . ”
46252	46265	46266	46266	She	1098	“ I guess so . Aunt Maggie , who is your bestest ? ”
46273	46276	46266	46266	She	1098	“ Thor . ”
46277	46280	46214	46214	Michael	53	“ Why ? ”
46281	46292	46293	46293	Michael	53	“ I like his long , blond hair and hammer . ”
46300	46309	46297	46297	his	53	“ You ’re hopeless . Such a girl . ”
46310	46317	46318	46318	Robert	119	“ Yeah , such a girl , ”
46321	46332	46333	46333	she	1098	“ I do n’t feel like a girl right now , ”
46398	46404	46405	46405	She	1098	“ I ’m a mess . ”
46468	46475	46476	46476	he	53	“ I think you look beautiful , ”
46563	46579	46580	46580	Robert	119	“ Pee - pee ! Boys have pee - pees , and girls have Vaselines ! ”
46590	46597	46580	46580	Robert	119	“ Vaginas , Luke . Vaginas . ”
46648	46668	46641	46641	she	50	“ Yes , well , let ’s not touch our private parts . Here’re the towels to dry off . ”
46706	46719	46721	46721	Luke	118	“ Why do n’t girls have pee - pees , Aunt Maggie ? ”
46759	46779	46780	46780	She	50	“ God made them different . And you ’re right , Robert , girls have what we call vaginas . ”
46790	46809	46780	46780	She	50	“ But without a pee - pee , girls have nothing to touch ! What do you do ? ”
46843	46848	46856	46856	she	50	“ Ask your uncle . ”
47100	47107	47108	47108	She	64	“ Back to bed , Maggie . ”
47113	47132	47108	47108	She	64	“ But Daddy , there ’s a monster in my closet and he ’s gon na get me . ”
47146	47167	47133	47135	The strange woman	1121	“ I ’m busy and you ’re acting like a baby . Get upstairs now or I ’ll spank you . ”
47168	47171	47133	47135	The strange woman	1121	“ But — ”
47172	47175	47176	47176	She	64	“ Now ! ”
47950	47953	47954	47954	She	50	“ Maggie . ”
47979	47989	47957	47957	her	50	“ Wake up , cara . You fell asleep . ”
47990	47994	47957	47957	her	50	“ So tired . ”
47995	48018	48019	48019	He	53	“ I know , baby . Why do n’t you close your eyes and sleep a bit before my cousins get home ? ”
48113	48130	48099	48099	she	50	“ I ’m so tired of being alone . Tired of not being wanted by anyone . ”
48202	48211	48190	48190	He	53	“ Why do you say that , cara ? ”
48235	48277	48226	48226	He	53	“ Because it ’s true . My parents did n’t want me . I tried very hard , but they did n’t love me . Then one day I thought I was in love . He told me I was special . ”
48287	48312	48313	48313	She	50	“ But he lied . So I promised myself I ’d never get hurt again . I promised I ’d never be rejected again . ”
48328	48340	48322	48322	her	50	“ And I have n’t been . I ’m just alone . ”
48422	48429	48430	48430	he	53	“ You ’re not alone now , ”
48433	48439	48430	48430	he	53	“ You ’re with me . ”
48683	48701	48702	48702	He	53	“ We have to slow down , cara , or I ’m going to take you here . ”
48747	48754	48740	48740	her	50	“ I want you , Michael . ”
48815	48826	48800	48800	he	53	“ Baby , I think we need to — Dios ! ”
48981	48992	48993	48993	He	115	“ Well , well , what do we have here ? ”
49002	49024	49025	49025	Michael	53	“ My four innocent sons are sleeping down the hallway and you ’re conducting yourselves like an X - rated movie . ”
49051	49059	49060	49060	Her	50	“ I ’m just kidding , Maggie . ”
49107	49134	49090	49090	Michael	53	“ Sorry , Bri , we ’re both exhausted . The boys are fine . They trashed the house and I did n’t clean it up . ”
49135	49138	49090	49090	Michael	53	“ Asshole . ”
49139	49142	49090	49090	Michael	53	“ Ditto . ”
49230	49235	49218	49218	He	53	“ I ’m sorry . ”
49251	49255	49246	49246	her	50	“ About what ? ”
49261	49279	49256	49256	She	50	“ About before . In the bathroom at your mama ’s house . I was a bitch . ”
49312	49315	49316	49316	He	53	“ Accepted . ”
49319	49325	49316	49316	He	53	“ Mind telling me why ? ”
49335	49341	49342	49342	He	53	“ I ’m screwed up . ”
49345	49368	49342	49342	He	53	“ Who is n’t ? I moved too fast . These past few days have been overwhelming , and I surprised you . ”
49375	49410	49369	49369	She	50	“ Oh , please . I had planned to seduce you , so you did n’t overwhelm me . Do n’t think I ’m some ditzy shrinking violet you can manipulate with your charm . ”
49427	49457	49411	49411	He	53	“ If that ’s so , I hope you make up your mind fast . I do n’t think I can take another night with a hard - on . ”
49465	49486	49461	49461	him	53	“ Maybe if you ’d stop driving like an old man , we ’d get home before you lose it . ”
49522	49536	49511	49511	Maggie	50	“ You go first . I need to grab something from my suitcase . ”
49806	49815	49800	49800	His	53	“ Um , Michael , maybe we should — ”
49816	49821	49822	49822	He	53	“ No , cara . ”
49830	49835	49822	49822	He	53	“ It ’s time . ”
50351	50358	50359	50359	he	53	“ You are so fucking beautiful , ”
50379	50392	50359	50359	he	53	“ Dios , if I do n’t taste you I ’ll die . ”
50393	50396	50362	50362	His	53	“ Michael — ”
50397	50415	50416	50416	His	53	“ Yes , Maggie , show me your pleasure . Tell me how much I please you . ”
50508	50522	50481	50481	he	53	“ I ’m going to — oh , God , I ca n’t — ”
50523	50530	50536	50536	he	53	“ Come for me , Maggie . ”
50717	50723	50724	50724	she	50	“ Take me , Michael , ”
50749	50752	50753	50753	He	53	“ Please . ”
50773	50791	50792	50792	He	53	“ You ask so nicely , cara . I ca n’t wait to bury myself inside you . ”
50849	50852	50853	50853	she	50	“ More , ”
50856	50864	50853	50853	she	50	“ Damn you , give me everything . ”
50946	50949	50950	50950	She	50	“ No ! ”
50964	50973	50950	50950	She	50	“ I ca n’t , I ca n’t . ”
50974	50986	50987	50987	Her	50	“ Shush , mia amore . Relax . Let me in . ”
51037	51042	51043	51043	He	53	“ I ca n’t . ”
51055	51066	51043	51043	He	53	“ Here , baby , I know what you need . ”
51100	51103	51088	51088	She	50	“ Better ? ”
51116	51119	51120	51120	He	53	“ Yes . ”
51129	51146	51120	51120	He	53	“ I ’m never going to last . Ride me , cara . Ride me hard . ”
51226	51234	51207	51207	his	53	“ Now , mia amore . Now . ”
51801	51804	51856	51856	she	50	“ Meow ! ”
51852	51855	51856	51856	she	50	“ Crap ! ”
51871	51877	51856	51856	she	50	“ Get away from me . ”
52037	52046	52032	52032	he	1193	“ Ah , I see you met Dante . ”
52089	52099	52100	52100	He	53	“ What do you feed it ? Small children ? ”
52126	52139	52140	52140	She	50	“ You ’re not afraid of cats , are you , cara ? ”
52143	52157	52140	52140	She	50	“ I just do n’t like them . They ’re demanding and spiteful . ”
52162	52171	52140	52140	She	50	“ Seems like you ’d go perfect together . ”
52172	52179	52180	52180	Michael	53	“ Funny . Is he yours ? ”
52185	52227	52182	52182	his	53	“ Nope , he ’s a stray . Visits a regular route for food , but wo n’t let anyone near him . Even Carina , whom we call the animal whisperer , has n’t gotten close . Dante has issues . ”
52254	52272	52293	52293	His	53	“ So Dante gets fed and catered to by the same people he openly despises . Interesting . ”
52273	52281	52282	52282	he	53	“ Yes , I guess it is , ”
52306	52314	52293	52293	His	53	“ Did you sleep well last night ? ”
52315	52318	52293	52293	His	53	“ Yes . ”
52319	52322	52323	52323	His	53	“ Liar . ”
52341	52360	52323	52323	His	53	“ But if three times still gave you enough sleep , I ’ll need to do better tonight . ”
52396	52399	52390	52390	His	53	“ Michael — ”
52400	52410	52411	52411	His	53	“ I love hearing my name on your lips . ”
52512	52515	52516	52516	He	53	“ Owww ! ”
52588	52591	52577	52577	He	53	“ Dante ! ”
52694	52708	52709	52709	he	53	“ I do n’t believe this . He ’s never done that before , ”
52712	52719	52709	52709	he	53	“ And he ’s never bitten . ”
52720	52747	52671	52671	he	61	“ What ? It ’s not my fault — I told you I do n’t like cats . I did n’t tell him to bite you ! ”
52748	52767	52768	52768	Maggie	50	“ No . It ’s deeper than that . Perhaps he sees something we ’ve all been missing . ”
52774	52785	52786	52786	she	50	“ And you feed this thing so he comes back ? ”
52791	52809	52786	52786	she	50	“ What is wrong with you ? He came at you like he smelled a tuna dinner . ”
52840	52845	52835	52835	he	1197	“ Margherita ? Michael ? ”
52895	52902	52877	52877	her	235	“ What is happening out here ? ”
52903	52912	52913	52914	Mama Conte	54	“ I was just introducing Maggie to Dante . ”
52917	52924	52913	52914	Mama Conte	54	“ Why is Dante near Margherita ? ”
52925	52938	52939	52939	Maggie	50	“ Yes , that seems to be the question of the day . ”
52964	52985	52954	52954	Dante	61	“ Mama , we ’ll be going to the office with Julietta in a bit . Do you need anything ? ”
52986	53015	53016	53016	She	50	“ I will give you a list of ingredients I ’m running low on . Margherita , I need help in the kitchen . Will you join me ? ”
53074	53090	53069	53069	she	50	“ Um , I really do n’t like cooking . Maybe Michael can help you . ”
53097	53113	53114	53114	She	235	“ Michael already knows how to cook — you do not . Come with me . ”
53139	53144	53145	53145	she	50	“ I hate cooking , ”
53148	53159	53145	53145	she	50	“ Your mother scares me . What if she suspects ? ”
53160	53179	53180	53180	She	50	“ She wo n’t . Just be nice , cara . And do n’t blow up the kitchen . ”
53412	53420	53406	53406	She	50	“ So what are we making today ? ”
53437	53443	53421	53422	Mama Conte	54	“ That is our recipe . ”
53444	53458	53459	53460	His mama	358	“ Oh , I figured you knew enough not to need a recipe . ”
53463	53517	53459	53460	His mama	358	“ I do , Margherita . But you need to learn how to follow instructions . This is one of our signature desserts at our bakery . We shall start simple . It ’s called torta di mele , an apple breakfast cake . It will go nicely with our coffee this afternoon . ”
53593	53606	53584	53584	she	50	“ I will supervise . Here are your measuring cups . Begin . ”
53679	53703	53672	53672	she	50	“ So Michael says you taught him to cook at an early age . Did he always want to run La Dolce Famiglia ? ”
53704	53719	53720	53722	the older woman	670	“ Michael wanted nothing to do with the business for a very long time , ”
53725	53739	53720	53722	the older woman	670	“ He had his heart set on being a race - car driver . ”
53746	53749	53720	53722	the older woman	670	“ What ? ”
53750	53831	53720	53722	the older woman	670	“ Si . He was very good , though my heart stopped every time he went out on the track . No matter how many times his papa and I tried to discourage him , he found a way back on the track . By then , the bakery was taking off , and we had opened up another one in Milan . His papa got into many riffs with him about his responsibility to the family and the business . ”
53832	53841	53842	53842	Maggie	50	“ He never told me he raced cars , ”
53866	53882	53859	53859	she	50	“ Um , I mean , he does n’t say much about his previous racing . ”
53883	53911	53925	53925	she	50	“ I am not surprised . He rarely talks about that part of his life anymore . No , Margherita , you crack an egg like this . ”
53989	53993	53994	53995	His mother	235	“ What happened ? ”
53998	54089	53994	53995	His mother	235	“ Things were difficult . A friend of his was injured , which made us even more upset . At this point , we knew Venezia wanted nothing to do with the bakery , and our dream of a family business began to die . Of course , we had other choices we could make . My husband wanted to expand ; I liked cooking and wanted to remain with the two bakeries . Who knows what we would have done ? God stepped in and Michael made his choice . ”
54125	54132	54133	54134	Mama Conte	54	“ Michael decided to quit racing ? ”
54148	54163	54136	54136	her	54	“ No . Michael walked out and decided to race cars for a living . ”
54170	54176	54136	54136	her	54	“ I do n’t understand . ”
54177	54213	54221	54221	She	50	“ He left and did the circuit for a year . He was young but talented , and his dream was to race in the Grand Prix . Then my husband had a heart attack . ”
54263	54267	54250	54250	Her	50	“ Tell me . ”
54280	54359	54274	54274	her	54	“ Si , you should know . When Michael ’s papa had the heart attack , Michael came right home . Stayed at the hospital day and night and refused to leave his side . I think we all believed he would be all right , but the second one struck hard and we lost him . When Michael came out of the room , he informed me he had quit racing and was taking over the business . ”
54379	54439	54376	54376	her	670	“ I lost something in my son that day , the same day I lost my husband . A piece of wildness , of freedom from restrictions that always burned bright . He became the perfect son , the perfect brother , the perfect businessman . Everything we needed from him . But he left something of himself behind . ”
54512	54539	54507	54507	her	235	“ So that is the story . You may do with it what you wish , but as his wife , I wanted you to know . ”
54590	54599	54574	54582	a man strong enough to make decisions for others	1229	“ Tell me about your parents , Margherita . ”
54609	54620	54621	54621	She	50	“ Why did your mother not teach you to cook ? ”
54626	54672	54621	54621	She	50	“ My mother is not the domestic sort . She worked in movies and believed her children would be better raised by nannies and cooks . That being said , I never wanted for anything , and enjoyed a wide variety of foods at meals . ”
54706	54715	54687	54687	She	631	“ Are you close with your parents now ? ”
54726	54743	54723	54723	her	50	“ No . My father is remarried and my mother prefers we do lunch only occasionally . ”
54744	54753	54687	54687	She	631	“ Grandparents ? Aunts or uncles ? Cousins ? ”
54754	54789	54687	54687	She	631	“ No one . Just me and my brother . It really was n’t a big deal ; we had all our needs taken care of , and life was quite easy for us . ”
54790	54793	54794	54794	Maggie	50	“ Bullshit . ”
54800	54803	54794	54794	Maggie	50	“ What ? ”
54804	54870	54871	54871	She	50	“ You heard me , Margherita . You did not have it easy . You had no one to guide you , teach you , care for you . A home is not only about things or needs being met . But this is not your fault . They are fools , your parents , for missing out on such a beautiful , special woman . ”
54876	54901	54871	54871	She	50	“ No matter . You learned strength and stand on your own two feet . This is why you are good for my son . ”
54905	54913	54914	54914	She	50	“ Hardly . We ’re completely different . ”
54929	54950	54923	54923	she	50	“ Um , I mean , well , we thought it would n’t work but then we fell in love . ”
54951	54957	54958	54958	Maggie	50	“ Hm , I see . ”
54969	54978	54958	54958	Maggie	50	“ When did you get married , Margherita ? ”
55007	55012	54999	54999	Devil	140	“ Two weeks ago . ”
55013	55017	55018	55018	She	50	“ The date ? ”
55024	55032	55018	55018	She	50	“ Um , Tuesday . May twentieth . ”
55041	55051	55033	55035	The older woman	670	“ A good day for a wedding , yes ? ”
55052	55055	54999	54999	Devil	140	“ Yes . ”
55056	55063	55064	55064	She	50	“ Do you love my son ? ”
55071	55074	55064	55064	She	50	“ What ? ”
55075	55082	54999	54999	Devil	140	“ Do you love my son ? ”
55083	55106	55107	55107	She	50	“ Well , of course , of course , I love him . I would n’t marry anyone I did n’t love . ”
55227	55255	55212	55213	his mother	235	“ Si , you are perfect together . You give him back his freedom . Before this visit is over , you will believe it , too . ”
55272	55293	55268	55269	Mama Conte	54	“ Now , I will show you how to use this . Pay attention or you can lose a finger . ”
55316	55352	55353	55353	She	50	“ Why are you doing this ? I still do n’t like to cook . I wo n’t be baking Michael yummy desserts and catering to his whims when we get back to the States . ”
55365	55391	55353	55353	She	50	“ I work late and order take - out and tell him to get his own beer . I ’ll never be the perfect wife . ”
55404	55434	55399	55400	Mama Conte	54	“ He ’s tried many times to love a woman who would be a proper wife . Or , at least , what he thinks a proper wife is . ”
55512	55548	55498	55498	she	235	“ And as for cooking , I am doing this for one reason . Every woman should know how to make one signature dessert . Not for anyone else but herself . Now , mix . ”
55822	55826	55827	55827	Michael	53	“ Absolutely not ! ”
55900	55911	55891	55891	he	53	“ How fast can you get us a new campaign ? ”
55928	55943	55918	55918	Their	771	“ Give us a week . It will blow you away and make waves . ”
55944	55962	55891	55891	he	53	“ Very good . I will discuss this further with my sisters and call you back in . ”
55963	55971	55998	55998	Julietta	58	“ Si . Grazie , Signore Conte . ”
55983	55995	55976	55976	Michael	53	“ Always remember to keep conflict within the family , Julietta . ”
56002	56034	56035	56035	He	53	“ You did n’t even hear me out . Again . Michael , I spent months helping with this campaign , and I think you ’re going in the wrong direction . ”
56048	56125	56037	56037	his	53	“ I ’ve seen the reports , and consumers want edge . A homey , plain - style bakery ad is not going to cut it in New York , and we need to freshen up things at home . I want to launch a whole new look . Hire a sexy model , maybe one eating a pastry , and come up with a catchy line playing off the whole comparison of sex and food . ”
56129	56153	56154	56154	She	58	“ Excuse me ? Are you nuts ? This is Mama ’s business and I refuse to see you exploit it for money ! ”
56166	56197	56154	56154	She	58	“ I ’m in charge here , and I like our new ads . Profit is steady , and there ’s no reason to throw something away that ’s working . ”
56198	56202	56203	56203	Michael	53	“ I disagree . ”
56215	56273	56209	56209	his	53	“ You may be the CEO , Julietta , but I still own the bulk of this company . I believe we need to take a risk with the new opening in New York . I ’ll need new print ads , a television spot , and billboards , and we will go in this new direction . ”
56308	56333	56297	56297	he	53	“ I know you are angry with my choice , but I feel it is best for the family . For La Dolce Famiglia . ”
56461	56473	56457	56458	his sister	227	“ I can not believe you would disrespect me like this . ”
56525	56546	56547	56547	Michael	53	“ I ’m not doing this anymore . Hire someone you trust , because obviously you do n’t trust me . ”
56567	56577	56557	56557	He	53	“ Ah , cara , I did n’t mean — ”
56578	56581	56582	56582	She	58	“ No ! ”
56589	56645	56582	56582	She	58	“ I ’m sick of the way you treat me . I ’m good enough to run La Dolce Famiglia when you ’re not here , but as soon as you step back onto my turf , you disrespect everything I ’ve worked so hard to build : respect , mutual admiration , work ethic . ”
56646	56663	56664	56664	Julietta	58	“ You ’re being ridiculous . I ’m only doing what ’s best for the company . ”
56667	56700	56664	56664	Julietta	58	“ I see . Well , then I do n’t think you need me anymore . I ’m resigning as CEO . Effective immediately . Go find someone else to boss around . ”
56720	56731	56732	56732	she	56	“ Why do you always have to order everyone around ? ”
56735	56744	56732	56732	she	56	“ You ’re our brother , not Papa . ”
56751	56808	56745	56745	His	53	“ No , perhaps if I was Papa , I would n’t have let you flounce off to dress a bunch of Barbie dolls and call it a career . Perhaps if I was Papa , I would ’ve made you take your rightful place in this company and not put all the weight on Julietta . ”
56824	56888	56809	56809	Venezia	56	“ I knew it ! I always knew you never respected my career . Fashion is a huge industry , Michael , and I ’ve made a name for myself in a competitive business . But no , just because I chose to do what I loved , that ’s not good enough for you . You do n’t respect any of us . ”
56889	56913	56914	56914	Venezia	56	“ Zitto ! Enough of your childish tantrums , both of you . I do what is best for this family , always . ”
56923	56970	56914	56914	Venezia	56	“ Who do you think you are ? You order us around like children , refuse to respect the decisions and choices we make , and pretend you actually care . We ’re making a life for ourselves here and have been doing fine without you . ”
56982	56997	56977	56977	he	1265	“ How could you say this to me ? After everything I ’ve done ? ”
57009	57033	57034	57034	They	1266	“ We do n’t need you anymore , Michael . Maybe it ’s time you return to America , where you belong now . ”
57155	57201	57149	57149	Maggie	50	“ Okay , I ’m bored and I want to go home . I visited the cafeteria twice , hung out with Julietta ’s secretary , and was sufficiently impressed with your organization . I ’ve done my wifely duty so I ’m heading out . ”
57216	57222	57208	57208	she	50	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
57223	57226	57227	57227	He	53	“ Nothing . ”
57232	57240	57227	57227	He	53	“ I shall meet you at home . ”
57252	57262	57241	57243	The blasted woman	1270	“ Did you have a fight with your sister ? ”
57285	57308	57282	57282	his	53	“ Make that sisters . I disagreed with Julietta ’s advertising campaign and they — what do you Americans term it?—blew up . ”
57309	57315	57316	57316	She	1270	“ Ah , I see . ”
57357	57364	57365	57365	she	1270	“ Is that the ad campaign ? ”
57405	57432	57368	57368	She	1270	“ Yes . It ’s outdated . I told them we need a sexy commercial equating food and sex . Americans like shock . It sells . ”
57433	57436	57437	57437	She	1270	“ Hm . ”
57449	57459	57437	57437	She	1270	“ Okay , I ’ll meet you at home . ”
57479	57485	57474	57474	he	53	“ What do you think ? ”
57486	57491	57510	57510	Her	1270	“ Of the campaign ? ”
57492	57499	57500	57500	She	1270	“ Yes . Am I right ? ”
57539	57543	57534	57534	she	1270	“ I agree . ”
57562	57567	57556	57556	he	53	“ I thought so . ”
57568	57577	57578	57578	He	53	“ But I hate your idea , too . ”
57581	57584	57578	57578	He	53	“ Scusi ? ”
57602	57619	57599	57599	her	1270	“ Some shock sells but not for a family bakery . Your mama would hate it . ”
57625	57653	57599	57599	her	1270	“ I see . Well , thanks for your opinion , but you really have nothing to do with this . I ’ll meet you at home . ”
57694	57795	57677	57678	his tigrotta	1274	“ Is that what you do to your sisters when you do n’t agree with their opinion ? No wonder they walked out . Oh , trust me , I can never forget my place . I do n’t want to be involved in this shit , but you keep messing up . For God ’s sake , Count , wake up . You treat your sisters with a patronizing air they ca n’t stand . Julietta is perfectly capable of running the business without you , yet instead of respecting her place , you challenge all of her decisions . ”
57796	57799	57800	57800	His	1275	“ Enough . ”
57807	57817	57800	57800	His	1275	“ You have no clue how my sisters feel . ”
57823	57988	57818	57818	She	1276	“ Are you kidding ? It ’s crystal clear . They adore you and believe you practically walk on water . They just want some kudos from their big brother . A little respect for what they ’ve accomplished . Do you know Venezia believes you think she ’s a joke ? She may dress celebrities and gain respect in her field , but it means nothing because you do n’t acknowledge her success . And Carina ? She loves to paint , but you term it a cute little hobby , pat her on the head , and force her to attend business school . She ’s got tons of talent and she aches to pursue it , but wants your approval . You ’re not seeing her , and the woman she ’s becoming . And Julietta keeps fighting the idea she ’s an imposter and the business will never truly belong to her . You ’ve made her doubt her instincts . ”
57996	58024	57818	57818	She	1276	“ I respect them and love them more than you know . Dios , they are my life ! I sacrificed everything so they can be happy . ”
58031	58035	58036	58036	she	1278	“ I know , ”
58039	58133	58134	58134	She	1279	“ You ’ve done everything a father would have done . You supported them with money , discipline , and good advice . You kept them safe . You made sure they did the right thing and wanted for nothing . But you forgot the most important part . They do n’t want a substitute father . They want an older brother who can joke with them , support them , and let them shine . On their own . They do n’t need you to take care of them anymore , Michael . ”
58150	58168	58134	58134	She	1279	“ They just want you to tell them you love them . Exactly the way they are . ”
58187	58201	58202	58202	she	1279	“ This is what I see for the image of La Dolce Famiglia , ”
58231	58278	58224	58224	her	235	“ It ’s not about sex and food . It ’s about this . Her dreams for her family , her determination to be the best , and the quality she strives for every day . That ’s what your motto and advertising campaign should be . ”
58300	58325	58326	58326	She	1279	“ You ’re so lucky to have them . Make a mistake and they ’ll forgive you . That ’s what family is about . ”
58336	58358	58359	58359	She	1279	“ I do n’t belong here , Michael . With you . With them . I ca n’t do this anymore . ”
59514	59519	59507	59507	She	50	“ Who is it ? ”
59520	59528	59507	59507	She	50	“ Carina . Can I come in ? ”
59529	59532	59533	59535	The younger girl	1317	“ Sure . ”
59624	59631	59632	59632	Maggie	50	“ How was your evening out ? ”
59635	59659	59632	59632	Maggie	50	“ And before you answer , it better be good . I dealt with your cousins last night and I ’m still recovering . ”
59673	59724	59667	59667	Her	103	“ Maggie , it was so awesome . I loooooved Sierra ; she was supercool . And gorgeous . And the guys were really nice and polite . It was a big group so I never felt uncomfortable and guess what ? They said I ’d make a great model ! ”
59728	59770	59725	59725	Maggie	50	“ You would , but I do n’t know if that ’s something you ’d want to pursue , Carina . Personally , I think you ’d do better off with a college education and your art . You ’re talented . ”
59777	59827	59725	59725	Maggie	50	“ Thanks . Yeah , Michael and Mama would probably freak . But it was cool they actually thought I ’d be good enough to model . They invited me to their next shoot , and now I have their cell numbers and we ’re texting back and forth . ”
59828	59838	59895	59895	She	1319	“ I ’m glad you made some new friends . ”
59839	59851	59725	59725	Maggie	50	“ Me , too . Can I ask for a favor ? ”
59852	59862	59725	59725	Maggie	50	“ As long as it does n’t entail babysitting . ”
59863	59894	59895	59895	She	1319	“ Can I borrow one of your scarves ? Do you have anything ice blue ? I want to try on a new outfit and I need a nice accessory . ”
59900	59918	59895	59895	She	1319	“ Venezia throws a fit when I borrow from her , and Julietta only owns business clothes . ”
59919	59940	59941	59941	Carina	103	“ Sure . I brought some extra in my travel bag . It ’s in the closet — help yourself . ”
59986	59991	59969	59969	Carina	103	“ What ’s this ? ”
60026	60029	60014	60015	The girl	785	“ No ! ”
60042	60065	60030	60030	Maggie	50	“ What ’s the matter ? Is this a love spell ? Oh , my God , it is . How cool . ”
60425	60441	60442	60442	She	50	“ Carina , it ’s nothing , really , I forgot it was in there . ”
60455	60466	60442	60442	She	50	“ My girlfriend gave it to me as a joke . ”
60472	60490	60467	60467	Carina	103	“ Did you do it ? The love spell ? Is that how you and Michael met ? ”
60503	60525	60491	60491	Humiliation	147	“ No , of course , not . It ’s just a joke and I forgot to get rid of it . ”
60531	60537	60526	60526	Carina	103	“ Can I have it ? ”
60550	60583	60538	60538	Maggie	50	“ What ? No , no , it ’s a silly thing . That stuff does n’t work and your brother will kill me if he sees you with a witchcraft book . ”
60584	60614	60615	60615	She	50	“ Not witchcraft . This says you have to list all the qualities you want and need in a mate . Follow the spell and he comes to you . ”
60626	60662	60615	60615	She	50	“ Wow , it says you have to make a fire to honor Earth Mother . Oh , Maggie , please ? I swear I wo n’t tell a soul , it ’s just supercool . ”
60713	60718	60696	60696	She	50	“ Maggie ? Please ? ”
60778	60820	60821	60821	Carina	103	“ Okay , fine . But do n’t tell anyone . You know it ’s just a joke , right ? Tell me you ’re not thinking of taking this seriously , Carina , or I ’ll throw it away now . ”
60831	60860	60861	60861	She	103	“ Promise . I just think it ’s fun . When I ’m done looking at it , I ’ll get rid of it . Thanks , Maggie ! ”
60928	60932	60922	60922	She	50	“ Go away ! ”
60933	60941	60942	60942	Michael	53	“ Maggie , I ’m coming in . ”
61012	61016	61017	61017	He	53	“ Come in . ”
61105	61114	61091	61091	His	53	“ I suppose you ’re here to yell . ”
61119	61124	61115	61115	His	53	“ Not this time . ”
61157	61180	61143	61143	her	50	“ Oh . Well , good , because I ’m not the in the mood . I ’ve had a crappy day . ”
61181	61193	61194	61194	She	50	“ Me , too . I ’m about to change that . ”
61243	61257	61239	61239	She	50	“ Michael , we have to talk . I want to go home . ”
61289	61292	61266	61266	He	53	“ Why ? ”
61298	61414	61266	61266	He	53	“ Um , let me think about this . Because this whole trip has been a disaster . Because I ’m miserable , and you ’re miserable , and we ’re making a mess out of your family . Because I hate lying , and I ca n’t spend one more day pretending to be your loving , dutiful wife . I ’ll come up with an excuse . Say someone died . A long - lost cousin or uncle so I wo n’t feel guilty . I think we made our intentions known to be married by a priest , and I ’m sure we can keep up the ruse until Venezia ’s wedding . ”
61505	61541	61486	61486	She	1340	“ In fact , if you really want me to , I ’ll come to Venezia ’s wedding . I gave you my word , and I intend to keep my side of the bargain . ”
61574	61582	61583	61583	he	53	“ Running scared , la mia tigrotta ? ”
61586	61602	61583	61583	he	53	“ I ’m disappointed . One night together and you already ca n’t handle it ? ”
61606	61663	61583	61583	he	53	“ You ’re the one who ca n’t handle the truth , Count . I ’m tired of pussyfooting around you like the rest of your family . It ’s time you wake up and face the way you view your sisters and admit you love control so much you ’ll do anything to keep it . ”
61664	61669	61670	61670	His	53	“ You are correct . ”
61703	61711	61779	61779	He	53	“ Huh ? What did you say ? ”
61712	61742	61779	61779	He	53	“ I said you are correct . I spoke with my sisters and begged for their apology . I agree with everything you said today in the conference room . ”
61792	61802	61803	61803	she	1340	“ What — what the hell are you doing ? ”
61806	61812	61803	61803	she	1340	“ Taking you to bed . ”
61859	61865	61851	61851	He	53	“ Come here , Maggie . ”
61888	61891	61851	61851	He	53	“ Huh ? ”
61892	61914	61915	61915	He	53	“ Hmm , I should have done this a while ago . Who would ’ve thought you ’d ever be speechless ? ”
61952	62011	62012	62012	He	53	“ Let me be clear , la mia tigrotta . I ’m taking you to bed . I ’m going to strip off your clothes , bury myself deep inside you , and make you come so many times the only word from your lips will be my name , begging me to do it all over again . ”
62042	62045	62023	62023	he	53	“ Capisce ? ”
62046	62056	62057	62057	His	53	“ I , I do n’t think , I — ”
62276	62280	62268	62268	His	53	“ Want something ? ”
62284	62289	62290	62290	He	53	“ I hate you . ”
62294	62309	62310	62310	He	53	“ I love you in this position . You have the most beautiful ass . ”
62322	62327	62310	62310	He	53	“ Michael , please . ”
62328	62331	62336	62336	his	53	“ Stay . ”
62347	62350	62351	62351	He	53	“ What ? ”
62361	62378	62351	62351	He	53	“ Stay with me to the end of the week , mia amore . Promise me . ”
62409	62416	62417	62417	He	53	“ Yes . I ’ll stay . ”
62783	62806	62807	62807	He	53	“ Oh , my God , your mother ! Carina ! I was loud , I forgot they were in the house . ”
62817	62856	62807	62807	He	53	“ Before I came to your room , Mama said she needed to go into town for some sort of surprise . She took Carina with her , so I knew we ’d have a few hours alone . ”
62864	62873	62874	62874	She	50	“ So you had this planned all along . ”
62881	62898	62874	62874	She	50	“ I figured you ’d come to yell at me for getting involved with your business . ”
62899	62906	62907	62907	Her	50	“ I planned on yelling afterward . ”
62984	62990	62991	62991	she	50	“ What were you saying ? ”
63008	63022	63023	63023	he	53	“ Do n’t play games you ca n’t win , la mia tigrotta , ”
63054	63063	63064	63064	she	50	“ I ’ll win this round , Count , ”
63099	63118	63119	63119	She	50	“ I ’d show you who ’s boss right now but I do n’t have another condom handy . ”
63143	63155	63132	63132	His	53	“ I ’m on the pill , and I ’m safe . ”
63382	63389	63359	63360	Mia amore	77	“ We have to get dressed . ”
63390	63393	63359	63360	Mia amore	77	“ Hm . ”
63413	63418	63359	63360	Mia amore	77	“ In a minute . ”
63419	63449	63450	63450	His	53	“ Your mom should be home with Carina . Venezia wants to go over bridesmaid accessories tonight . And I have to help cook dinner again , damn it . ”
63465	63481	63458	63458	she	50	“ Sorry , cara , this whole week was not what either of us expected . ”
63488	63495	63482	63482	Her	50	“ No . It was n’t . ”
63499	63508	63482	63482	Her	50	“ Michael , what happened with your sisters ? ”
63525	63533	63534	63534	Regret	148	“ You were right . About everything . ”
63552	63602	63603	63603	Her	50	“ I got lost in my role and made a lot of mistakes . After you left , I spoke with my sisters and apologized . I also showed them your photo of Mama and they loved it . We ’re launching a new campaign based on your photograph . ”
63608	63617	63603	63603	Her	50	“ Are you kidding ? That ’s wonderful . ”
63703	63816	63691	63691	Michael	53	“ Listen to me , Maggie . This is important . In a few days , you saw things I ’d never even realized . How I treated my sisters and what they really needed from me . You made four little boys feel loved and taken care of , even though it was the first time they ever met you . You respected my mother and made food in her kitchen , which is the most important thing you can ever give her . You gave my little sister a reason to believe in herself again , and believe she is beautiful . You are an amazing woman , Maggie Ryan . ”
63828	63833	63817	63817	He	1358	“ Stay with me . ”
63861	63876	63856	63856	her	1359	“ Michael ! Are you in there ? Come quick ; Mama ’s sick ! ”
63926	63931	63932	63932	he	1358	“ Where is she ? ”
63955	64001	63942	63942	She	1359	“ Dr. Restevo is with her . We went into town and everything was fine , and then she said she felt weak and dizzy . I told her to rest because the sun was hot today , but she insisted I get the doctor . ”
64008	64029	64005	64005	her	1359	“ Maybe I should have taken her to the hospital ? I did n’t know what to do , Michael . ”
64030	64038	64039	64039	He	1363	“ Shush , you did everything right . ”
64050	64073	64039	64039	He	1363	“ Let ’s wait for a few minutes and see what the doctor says . Perhaps it is nothing . Va bene ? ”
64124	64134	64135	64135	Michael	53	“ Buon giorno , Doctor . How is Mama ? ”
64209	64221	64198	64198	He	840	“ Um , a hospital is not necessary at the moment . ”
64257	64284	64249	64249	Carina	103	“ What ’s wrong with her ? Did she have a heart attack ? Why are n’t you telling us something — is it very bad ? ”
64297	64311	64285	64286	The doctor	1858	“ No heart attack . She needs to rest ; that ’s it . ”
64312	64327	64328	64328	Michael	53	“ Was it the heat ? Her medication ? Anything we need to do ? ”
64341	64361	64334	64334	his	1858	“ Keep her in bed today . Plenty of liquids . This happens sometimes , no need to worry . ”
64377	64401	64362	64364	The older man	840	“ Remember one thing , Michael . No stress . Whatever your mother asks for , just give it to her . Capisce ? ”
64402	64405	64406	64407	The doctor	1858	“ But — ”
64446	64460	64467	64467	he	1858	“ Congratulations on your marriage , signora bella . Welcome to the family . ”
64476	64493	64494	64494	Carina	103	“ Oh , thank goodness . It was probably just the long walk and the heat , ”
64497	64508	64494	64494	Carina	103	“ I ’ll go get her some water and juice . ”
64664	64668	64659	64659	His	53	“ Thank you . ”
64674	64693	64669	64669	She	50	“ For what , Count ? Not being a pain in your ass for a minute or two ? ”
64713	64718	64700	64700	He	1858	“ For being there . ”
64750	64763	64764	64764	He	1858	“ I ’m going to check on her . Be right back . ”
64890	64898	64879	64879	He	1858	“ Mama . How do you feel ? ”
64905	64933	64899	64899	She	253	“ Silly weak heart . Quite annoying . Your papa and I used to hike in our spare time and climb mountains . Do n’t get old . ”
64942	64967	64968	64968	She	253	“ Carina ’s bringing you liquids and I want you to stay in bed . No baking . No stress . Doctor ’s orders . ”
64974	64988	64968	64968	She	253	“ Baking relaxes me . But I will stay in bed , Michael . ”
64998	65003	64989	64989	Her	253	“ At least today . ”
65004	65007	65041	65041	His	1385	“ Mama — ”
65079	65083	65084	65084	Michael	53	“ Father Richard ! ”
65145	65152	65153	65153	Michael	53	“ What are you doing here ? ”
65159	65177	65153	65153	Michael	53	“ Wait — Dios , you ’re not here thinking she needs last rites , are you ? ”
65199	65225	65189	65189	He	83	“ Of course not , Michael . Your mama will outlive all of us if my instincts are right . Did n’t she tell you ? ”
65238	65269	65189	65189	He	83	“ No , I ’m sorry , Father . Is this about Venezia ’s wedding ? She ’s not here at the moment but should be home later this afternoon . ”
65270	65284	65285	65285	Carina	103	“ Wait ! Let me get Maggie ; she needs to hear this . ”
65320	65330	65311	65311	Carina	103	“ Mama , can I tell them ? Please ? ”
65335	65355	65311	65311	Carina	103	“ Mama and I went into town to get Father Richard . We have a big surprise for you . ”
65386	65390	65391	65391	Carina	103	“ What surprise ? ”
65397	65435	65391	65391	Carina	103	“ Father Richard can marry you in Italy ! Right now ! Venezia and Julietta will be here any moment . Michael , we got approval for you to marry Maggie . We ’re having a wedding ! ”
65651	65669	65647	65647	Carina	103	“ Um , guys ? Are n’t you excited ? We ’re going to have a wedding . ”
65697	65717	65691	65691	Maggie	50	“ Listen , everyone . We have something important to tell you . You see , Michael and I — ”
65718	65721	65722	65722	Michael	53	“ Wait ! ”
65753	65788	65739	65739	he	439	“ What Maggie means to say is , we never expected to have the ceremony take place so soon . Maggie had her heart set on inviting our cousins and uncles to the celebration . ”
65797	65831	65789	65789	His	439	“ How did the approval go so fast ? I mean , Father Richard , I figured you ’d want Maggie and me to go through some classes first before blessing our union . ”
65851	65922	65832	65833	Father Richard	83	“ Well , of course , that is the standard , Michael . You know the church takes a while to approve a marriage , but you have been under my care since you were young . As soon as your mother knew you were flying back home , she contacted me and we pushed the paperwork through . You are a count , and royalty does have some assets . ”
65993	66059	66060	66060	Her	54	“ I understand , my son . And I do not wish to take away your wishes , but I ’m afraid I will not be up for a big party . I feel so weak . The doctor will be back tomorrow , and he said if I am still this way , he may choose to take me to the hospital for tests . ”
66069	66097	66060	66060	Her	54	“ I ask you two to do this for me . Recite your vows on the back terrace so I can be certain your union is complete . ”
66111	66153	66154	66154	She	54	“ See , there ’s nothing to worry about . I know we ’d rather do a big party , but if you ’re flying back next week , Mama decided it ’s more important to have the religious ceremony immediately . ”
66160	66253	66154	66154	She	54	“ Maggie , I got a dress for you ! I hope you like it ; I snuck in your closet and got your size , and I have it in my room . Let ’s get you dressed ! The girls should be here any moment . Michael , you should wear that gorgeous tux you left here from the last time . La Dolce Famiglia delivered a chocolate cannoli cream cake , and I have a few bottles of champagne chilling . This is going to be so much fun ! ”
66433	66474	66418	66418	Michael	53	“ Listen to me , Maggie . Breathe . Slow and steady . You will be all right ; I have you and I wo n’t let anything happen to you . Give up your control and let yourself go . ”
66588	66593	66577	66577	He	53	“ Better , cara ? ”
66655	66675	66676	66676	He	53	“ Let me get you some water . Stay there and just relax . We will work this out . ”
66728	66741	66742	66742	he	53	“ I guess the thought of marrying me was n’t very tasteful , ”
66751	66781	66746	66746	She	50	“ Did n’t mean to hit your ego , Count . Just something about legally marrying my fake husband in front of his family threw me for a second . ”
66792	66798	66782	66782	He	53	“ This is very bad . ”
66799	66831	66832	66832	She	50	“ You think ? I feel like your mother is the hitman from the movie The Marrying Man . Remember when the mobster made them get married because they had sex ? ”
66835	66861	66832	66832	She	50	“ We never should have gone to bed together . Somehow , we ’re being punished . We have to tell your mother the truth . ”
66877	66892	66870	66870	he	53	“ I do not know this movie , and my family is not Mafia . ”
66898	66918	66893	66893	She	50	“ Well , duh ! Why do I feel like you ’re not on the same page as me ? ”
66919	66923	66924	66924	Lord	1417	“ What page ? ”
66938	66948	66933	66933	he	53	“ Never mind . Why are n’t you horrified ? ”
66949	67003	67004	67004	Maggie	50	“ I am ! I ’m just thinking of all the angles . Look , cara , my mother is sick . The doctor said to avoid all stress and give her anything she asks for . If I tell her the truth now , she may end up having a heart attack . ”
67025	67034	67018	67018	She	50	“ Michael , what are you asking me ? ”
67053	67061	67062	67062	He	53	“ I want you to marry me . ”
67065	67069	67062	67062	He	53	“ For real . ”
67077	67141	67070	67070	She	50	“ What ? We ca n’t do this . Are you crazy ? We ’ll be legally married . When we get back to the States , we ’ll have to go through an annulment or divorce or something . Oh , my God , this is insane . How is this happening ? I ’m trapped in a frickin ’ romance novel ! ”
67142	67146	67147	67147	He	53	“ Calm down . ”
67156	67236	67147	67147	He	53	“ Listen to me , Maggie . I will take care of everything . No one else has to know . We ’ll say our vows , have a party , and leave for home . I ’ll take care of all the paperwork and expenses . It will be discreet . I ’m asking you to do this for my mother , for my family . I know I ask too much , but I ’m asking anyway . ”
67613	67619	67620	67620	He	53	“ I ’ll do it . ”
67630	67672	67625	67625	she	50	“ On one condition , Count . Stop pushing me . We finish this ruse for the rest of the week and go our separate ways . No more sleeping together . No more pretending this is more than it is . ”
67686	67695	67673	67673	His	53	“ This is what you ask from me ? ”
67713	67722	67700	67700	she	50	“ Yes . This is what I want . ”
67723	67734	67735	67735	he	53	“ I am sorry you feel this way , cara , ”
67751	67755	67756	67756	Maggie	50	“ Va bene . ”
67774	67794	67758	67758	her	50	“ Carina , get up here and help me get that wedding gown on . And uncork the champagne . ”
68206	68210	68201	68203	the Conte family	1447	“ I do . ”
68294	68337	68284	68284	Venezia	56	“ I ’m so happy ! Now , we have another surprise for you . We ’re sending you to our second home in Lake Como for a honeymoon night . You need some privacy without worrying about your family sleeping downstairs . ”
68350	68364	68343	68343	she	56	“ Leave now and we wo n’t expect you back till tomorrow night . ”
68373	68399	68365	68365	Michael	53	“ I thought we rented it out for the season ? And I do n’t feel comfortable leaving her before I confirm she ’s okay . ”
68427	68484	68412	68412	She	353	“ Oh , you will go , Michael and Margherita . The house is empty for the next month , so you might as well take advantage . The girls will take care of me and call immediately if anything changes . You will not rob me of the satisfaction of giving you a honeymoon night . ”
68593	68599	68582	68583	The woman	353	“ Thank you , Maggie . ”
68600	68604	68605	68605	Her	353	“ For what ? ”
68610	68714	68605	68605	Her	353	“ For what you did . I know you probably dreamed of your own wedding with Michael in the future , and I also suspect Michael rushed this engagement for me . You ’ve changed him . When he came to apologize to me , he admitted he never realized how he acted until you told him . I can only hope you know how much you mean to this family . You ’ve given me a gift — the opportunity to marry Dominick this summer — and I ’ll never forget it . I ’m so glad you belong to us now . ”
68848	68856	68857	68857	she	1457	“ What are we going to do ? ”
68861	68895	68857	68857	she	1457	“ Have you even thought this whole thing through ? Are we going to tell Alexa and my brother ? What if your family visits the States ? What about Venezia ’s wedding ? ”
68913	68939	68940	68940	His	53	“ Let ’s not worry about that now , cara . I think we need a night alone to work out some things between us . ”
68990	69038	69039	69039	His	53	“ Sorry , silly female that I am . Why worry about such things as vows to God and divorce ? Let ’s have some fun . Oh , I know a great subject to talk about . Your mother told me you used to race cars . ”
69064	69078	69079	69079	he	53	“ She told you , huh ? We never talk about that anymore , ”
69082	69115	69079	69079	he	53	“ I raced when I was young . My papa got sick , and it was time to head the family business , so I gave it up . End of story . ”
69140	69151	69135	69135	She	1457	“ You were good . You could ’ve gone pro . ”
69152	69160	69135	69135	She	1457	“ Probably . We ’ll never know . ”
69172	69182	69183	69183	she	1457	“ Do you resent having to give it up ? ”
69187	69202	69183	69183	she	1457	“ You never wanted to run La Dolce Famiglia , did you , Michael ? ”
69218	69223	69224	69224	he	53	“ Does it matter ? ”
69227	69245	69224	69224	he	53	“ I did what I had to do . For my family . I have no regrets . ”
69274	69327	69267	69267	He	53	“ Yes , it matters . Have you ever even recognized and mourned the loss of something you loved ? Not your father . Your dream . You were getting close to something you ’d always wanted and suddenly it was ripped away from you . I ’d be severely pissed off . ”
69343	69353	69354	69354	he	53	“ My papa and I had a difficult relationship , ”
69357	69451	69452	69452	He	53	“ He looked upon my racing as a dangerous , selfish hobby . Eventually , he pushed me to choose — my career or the family bakery . I chose the circuit , so he told me to leave . I packed my stuff , went on the road , and tried making myself a name . But when I got the call that he had a heart attack , and saw him so frail and sick in the hospital , I realized my wishes were n’t as important as I originally thought . ”
69455	69507	69452	69452	He	53	“ I realized sometimes others have to come first . As Papa once told me , a real man makes decisions for everyone , not just himself . I owed it to everyone to make the business work , and I did . In a way , I have no regrets . ”
69515	69521	69522	69522	He	53	“ Do you miss it ? ”
69538	69549	69524	69524	his	53	“ Hell , yes . I miss racing every day . ”
69621	69630	69631	69631	she	1463	“ Your family is lucky to have you , ”
69987	69996	69997	69997	she	50	“ Do you want to go to dinner ? ”
70000	70003	69997	69997	she	50	“ No . ”
70040	70053	70028	70028	She	50	“ Do you want to go for a walk in the gardens ? ”
70054	70057	70022	70022	he	1482	“ No . ”
70058	70063	70083	70083	her	50	“ Take a swim ? ”
70064	70067	70068	70068	She	50	“ Nope . ”
70086	70105	70068	70068	She	50	“ Well , what do you want to do ? Just stand there making googly eyes at me ? ”
70106	70118	70124	70124	His	1482	“ No . I want to make love to my wife . ”
70137	70143	70144	70144	she	50	“ Do n’t say that , ”
70160	70183	70184	70184	He	1482	“ I ’m not really your wife and we both know it . You promised to leave me alone . No sex . ”
70207	70226	70227	70227	He	1482	“ La mia tigrotta , what is wrong ? I would never do anything you did n’t want . ”
70241	70247	70227	70227	He	1482	“ This is a lie . ”
70261	70267	70268	70268	His	1482	“ We ’re a lie . ”
70355	70360	70361	70361	he	1482	“ No , Maggie , ”
70365	70398	70361	70361	he	1482	“ This is not a lie anymore . We are not a lie . I want to make love to you , my wife . Right now . Will you let me ? ”
70701	70706	70695	70695	he	1482	“ This is real . ”
71277	71283	71274	71274	She	50	“ See anything you like ? ”
71318	71331	71332	71332	she	50	“ The letter C stands for all the items needed in life , ”
71335	71343	71332	71332	she	50	“ Coffee , chocolate , and champagne . ”
71364	71375	71353	71353	Michael	53	“ Are n’t you missing the best letter of all ? ”
71376	71381	71388	71388	Her	50	“ What ’s that ? ”
71382	71387	71388	71388	Her	50	“ S. For sex . ”
71409	71425	71426	71426	she	50	“ Oh , Count , when are you going to learn all the American words ? ”
71429	71436	71426	71426	she	50	“ C is also for climax . ”
71447	71461	71444	71444	his	53	“ Cara , you are amazing . Both in and out of bed . ”
71462	71466	71467	71467	She	50	“ I try . ”
71494	71504	71480	71480	He	53	“ Maggie , do you like being in control ? ”
71505	71512	71513	71513	He	53	“ Is that a bad thing ? ”
71526	71564	71519	71519	she	50	“ Not at all . You ’re a strong woman and you would n’t have made it this far in life without such a quality . I just wondered how you felt about being dominated in bed . ”
71573	71581	71565	71565	She	50	“ Why ? Do you like domination ? ”
71585	71612	71582	71582	She	50	“ I ’m not into that sub stuff , Count . I ’ve read those BDSM novels but whips just do n’t do it for me . ”
71621	71657	71658	71658	She	50	“ No , cara , I ’m not into pain , either . It seems you prefer to control the lovemaking , which is fine , but I wonder if you ’ve ever truly surrendered . ”
71663	71677	71658	71658	She	50	“ I surrender every time I climax . What are you getting at ? ”
71701	71707	71708	71708	she	50	“ What are you doing ? ”
71711	71715	71708	71708	she	50	“ Getting kinky ? ”
71721	71729	71716	71716	He	53	“ Do you trust me , Maggie ? ”
71736	71739	71716	71716	He	53	“ Why ? ”
71740	71744	71745	71745	She	50	“ Do you ? ”
71748	71756	71745	71745	She	50	“ Yes . I do trust you . ”
71769	71785	71766	71766	her	50	“ Thank you . I ’m asking you to let me do something to you . ”
71786	71789	71716	71716	He	53	“ What ? ”
71790	71795	71716	71716	He	53	“ Tie you up . ”
71808	71823	71800	71800	her	50	“ Tell me you ’re joking . Ca n’t we just have regular sex ? ”
71824	71895	71716	71716	He	53	“ Yes . But I want more with you . I want to give you so much pleasure you explode . I want you to be able to let go , on your own terms . I ’m asking you to trust me enough to surrender your control for tonight . If you get uncomfortable , tell me to stop and I will . Will you do this for me ? ”
71912	71924	71925	71925	she	1501	“ I do n’t know if I can give up control , ”
71928	71934	71925	71925	she	1501	“ I think you can . ”
71956	71980	71981	71981	He	1502	“ We can have some fun . I always dreamed of tying up my wife . You can make my fantasy come true . ”
72003	72008	72000	72000	she	1501	“ I ’ll try . ”
72016	72036	72009	72009	She	1501	“ But only because you have some bondage fetish I think you need to get out of your system . ”
72109	72113	72114	72114	She	1501	“ Now what ? ”
72308	72321	72302	72302	she	1501	“ Damn you , untie me ! I want to touch you . ”
72322	72338	72339	72339	She	1501	“ Not yet , cara . I am having too much fun with my fantasy . ”
72450	72453	72442	72442	he	1502	“ Michael . ”
72477	72481	72463	72463	she	1501	“ Do n’t . ”
72494	72512	72492	72492	himself	1502	“ Look at me , mia amore . Look into my eyes and see who I am . ”
72566	72592	72593	72593	He	1502	“ I love you , Maggie . It ’s never been Alexa , and it never will be . I ’m in love with you . ”
72881	72905	72871	72871	He	1502	“ Thank you for giving me your trust . I want to know all of you , cara , but I can wait . ”
72985	73061	73062	73062	His	1502	“ I was sixteen . I was crushing majorly on the cliché of all clichés — the quarterback of the football team . Of course , he barely noticed me , but I did all the usual girly things to gain his attention . One day , he came over and talked to me . Days later , he asked me out . I was giddy and believed we ’d finally be boyfriend and girlfriend . ”
73101	73146	73147	73147	He	1502	“ I made myself up with lots of makeup . Short skirt , lots of cleavage showing the little I had . I had no one to chaperone me at the time , so I came and went as I pleased with no rules . “
73250	73279	73280	73280	He	1502	” She gulped a breath , and his hand clasped hers . He waited in silence as she struggled , but his warmth slowly seeped into her skin . “
73362	73393	73347	73347	he	1502	“ I got out of the car and my mother was watching television in the living room . I went straight over to her and told her the whole story . ”
73422	73458	73408	73408	someone	1860	“ My mother laughed and told me I got what I asked for . Said to get on birth control , get smarter , and deal with it . Then she walked away from me . ”
73473	73548	73459	73459	Maggie	50	“ I did n’t know what to do . Felt like I could go insane . I took the next few days off , then went back to school . And when I passed him in the hall , I just nodded a hello . The pregnancy test came back negative . I got on birth control . And suddenly , I realized I had two paths before me and I needed to choose . “
73615	73626	73627	73627	I	0	” Her heart pounded on the verge of an attack . “
73716	73748	73749	73749	I	0	” Michael reached out and tucked her head against his chest . Strength and heat and safety wound its way through her with a seamless grace that took her breath away . “
73775	73782	73765	73765	I	0	” She shook her head hard . “
73798	73853	73855	73855	someone	1860	” He sucked in a breath , and she realized he trembled beneath her . Slowly , she raised her head to look into his face . Fierce pride and raw fury shimmered in his eyes . His hands were as gentle as a butterfly as he stroked the hair back from her face . “
73905	73960	73901	73901	You	1524	” She bit her lip and lowered her head back on his chest . His words echoed in the silence of the room and exploded the last brick of the wall guarding her heart . He did n’t comment on the tear that fell upon his chest . That made Maggie love him even more .
74044	74052	74053	74053	she	50	“ You ’re such a drama king , ”
74104	74114	74083	74083	her	50	“ Fine , fine , here , happy now ? ”
74399	74419	74420	74420	she	50	“ Yeah , I bet you ’re a male stud , knocking up all the helpless females around town , ”
74426	74451	74420	74420	she	50	“ Take some responsibility for your actions , buddy . I think I need to take you to the vet and get you fixed . ”
74452	74460	74461	74461	Maggie	50	“ Are you talking to the cat ? ”
74481	74486	74487	74487	she	50	“ Of course not , ”
74491	74497	74498	74498	She	50	“ You ’re hearing things . ”
74501	74510	74511	74511	She	50	“ Yeah , sure . Hi , Dante . ”
74581	74589	74590	74590	she	50	“ Why does n’t he like me ? ”
74593	74610	74611	74611	Maggie	50	“ I love animals . I feed him . You insult him and he adores you . ”
74614	74624	74590	74590	she	50	“ Men are fickle . What ’s going on ? ”
74625	74639	74640	74640	Maggie	50	“ We ’re going into town to look at flowers . Wanna come ? ”
74645	74652	74640	74640	Maggie	50	“ Boring . I ’ll pass . ”
74656	74688	74653	74653	Carina	103	“ I know , I ’m not a flower kind of girl myself , but since you ’re still new to the family , you can get out of these things . ”
74695	74717	74689	74689	She	103	“ Fine , be a brat . I ’ll see you a bit later . Mama ’s resting but doing fine . ”
74726	74774	74689	74689	She	103	“ It ’s really weird , too . As soon as you guys left , she had all this energy , was back to her old self , and seemed fine . The doctor came again and said the whole thing must have been a false alarm . ”
74775	74787	74822	74822	Michael	53	“ Huh . Weird , but at least she ’s better . ”
74788	74799	74800	74800	Carina	103	“ Yeah , you ’re right . See you later . ”
74885	74916	74917	74917	He	53	“ No , Max , she did n’t marry me for my money . She makes enough on her own . You are like an overprotective mama , mia amico . ”
74931	74977	74917	74917	He	53	“ You did what ? Hiring a private detective to check on her background is unacceptable . Yes , I know about her past . She is unlike her parents . Merda , do not challenge me on this ; she is my wife now . ”
74981	75018	75021	75021	his	1545	“ No , I do n’t think children will happen for a while — she needs some time . She is not the typical woman I wanted to marry but things change . I can wait . ”
75027	75047	75021	75021	his	1545	“ This is my decision and I no longer want to discuss it . I will make this work . ”
75206	75230	75204	75204	him	53	“ Ah , la mia tigrotta , would you like to go for a walk with me ? It is a beautiful evening . ”
75279	75287	75265	75265	Maggie	50	“ Michael , I ’m going home . ”
75302	75314	75299	75299	He	53	“ What ’s the matter , Maggie ? Did something happen ? ”
75315	75323	75299	75299	He	53	“ I want to go home alone . ”
75324	75330	75331	75331	He	53	“ Is this about us ? ”
75339	75371	75331	75331	He	53	“ Are you running scared because I confessed my feelings ? I know we did n’t talk about it right away , but I thought I ’d give you some time . ”
75380	75417	75372	75372	She	50	“ Do n’t do me any favors , Count . Let ’s just say I ’m sick of the lies , and I want my life back . Not this fake life . This fake marriage . ”
75428	75472	75473	75473	she	50	“ This is all bullshit ! We ’ve been playing a part , pretending to be married , then forced into a real marriage when there ’s no way it ’ll work . We ’re too different . I do n’t want this ! ”
75477	75539	75473	75473	she	50	“ I do n’t want overbearing sisters , and stray cats , and forced baking lessons ! I do n’t want to feel strangled all the time under the weight of responsibility . I like being free and making my own choices . So it ’s time we both wake up and stop playing at a damn movie of the week . ”
75558	75567	75568	75568	he	1560	“ Did my words mean nothing to you ? ”
75572	75585	75568	75568	he	1560	“ I told you I loved you . Did that mean nothing ? ”
75599	75605	75606	75606	She	50	“ Your words meant nothing . ”
75631	75671	75622	75622	she	50	“ Leave me alone ; ca n’t you see I do n’t want this anymore ? I do n’t want you or this awful lifestyle your real wife would inherit ! Have some pride , for God ’s sake . ”
75797	75803	75804	75804	Maggie	50	“ What ’s going on ? ”
75945	75959	75960	75960	Alexa	52	“ I ca n’t believe you got a puppy . Nick hates messes . ”
75976	76022	76023	76023	Maggie	50	“ Oh , I did n’t do it this time . Nick was coming home from the waterfront and found Simba in the woods , crying . Bruises all over the poor thing ’s body . Must have been thrown out of a moving car . ”
76026	76048	76049	76049	Alexa	52	“ I ca n’t believe he did n’t take it to the shelter . What have you done to my brother ? ”
76085	76124	76125	76125	She	63	“ First he took the dog to the vet , then brought it home while demanding I do n’t get attached . He said he ’d put an ad in the paper and find the dog a home . ”
76128	76164	76125	76125	She	63	“ So I let him . After a week , the ad disappeared and we never spoke about it again . He says hello to the puppy before me when he gets home from work . ”
76276	76291	76292	76292	Maggie	50	“ Well , you can thank him properly because I got you a present . ”
76301	76317	76318	76318	Alexa	52	“ No details , please . Still too weird for you to shag my brother . ”
76333	76350	76318	76318	Alexa	52	“ Thanks , babe , it ’s just what we needed tonight . Besides a babysitter . ”
76351	76380	76381	76381	Maggie	50	“ I ’ll take her one night this week so you can have a date night . I ’m not going on any other trips for a while . ”
76423	76439	76440	76440	She	52	“ Maggie , you have to tell me the truth . What ’s going on ? ”
76443	76459	76440	76440	She	52	“ Went to Italy . Saw Michael . Back now . Nothing else to tell . ”
76460	76467	76468	76468	Her	50	“ Michael came to see me . ”
76476	76485	76473	76473	she	50	“ What ? What did he tell you ? ”
76522	76568	76511	76511	Her	52	“ Michael told me everything , Maggie . About going to Italy and pretending to be his wife . About the priest making it real . And how he confessed his feelings to you but you ran away and threw them back in his face . ”
76591	76603	76583	76583	She	50	“ He did n’t give you the whole story , Alexa . ”
76604	76611	76615	76615	her	50	“ Then why do n’t you ? ”
76618	76625	76626	76626	Maggie	50	“ You ’re my best friend . ”
76641	76715	76626	76626	Maggie	50	“ I ’m so sorry . I had a plan , but the whole thing misfired and now it ’s a mess . I made Michael a bargain — I’d pretend to be his wife if he promised to stay away from you . I know he has deep feelings , and I was worried about you and Nick . He agreed , but when we got to Italy , things got complicated . ”
76716	76739	76583	76583	She	50	“ I can not believe you are still stuck on this idea . There ’s never been anything between us but friendship . ”
76740	76746	76626	76626	Maggie	50	“ I know that now . ”
76747	76758	76626	76626	Maggie	50	“ What happened ? You started to fall for him ? ”
76762	76811	76759	76759	Maggie	50	“ At first I thought it was just sex . But then his family sucked me in , and the stupid cat , and then we had more sex and I began to get crazy ideas about a relationship between us . He told me he loved me . ”
76818	76825	76812	76812	Alexa	52	“ And what did you say ? ”
76826	76864	76865	76865	She	50	“ Nothing . I could n’t say anything , because I did n’t really believe him . I was going to talk about it , but then I heard him on the phone with his friend Max . ”
76870	76894	76895	76895	Alexa	52	“ He did n’t believe I was good enough for Michael . Thought we were a terrible match , and he ’s right . ”
76898	76909	76895	76895	Alexa	52	“ When have you ever listened to anyone ’s opinion ? ”
76916	76977	76910	76910	Maggie	50	“ I heard the conversation . I ’m not right for him — I’m not the type of woman he needs . He wants a big family with pets and constant trips to Italy . He wants a nice , solid wife with a respectable career and a sweet manner . We fight . And I hate all those things . ”
76978	76983	76984	76984	Alexa	52	“ Oh , Maggie . ”
76995	77114	76984	76984	Alexa	52	“ My dear friend , do n’t you know you are all those things ? When are you finally going to believe it ? Just your loyalty toward Nick and me and your willingness to protect us tells me you were meant to have a family of your own . Michael is a complicated man — something not many other women see or even know is there . But you do . You challenge him , and push him , and make him feel things more intensely . When he came to tell me everything , his heart was broken . He believes you do n’t love him , can never love him , and he ’s destroyed . ”
77204	77244	77245	77245	Her	50	“ I ’m sorry , Al . I want to move on with my life and I never want to talk about Michael Conte again . If you ’re truly my friend , you ’ll do this for me . ”
77249	77252	77245	77245	Her	50	“ Please . ”
77260	77263	77253	77253	Alexa	52	“ But — ”
77264	77267	77268	77268	She	50	“ Please . ”
77277	77290	77268	77268	She	50	“ Okay . I just want you to be happy , Maggie . ”
77312	77327	77304	77304	she	50	“ I ’ll be okay . Now , let ’s talk about something else . ”
77827	77834	77835	77835	He	53	“ Alexa ? Is everything okay ? ”
78493	78498	78499	78499	he	53	“ Ladies and gentlemen , ”
78505	78588	78499	78499	he	53	“ I ’m pleased to be with you to finally reveal the culmination of a family dream . My family built their first bakery in Bergamo , Italy , with pastries cooked out of my mama ’s kitchen . With a lot of hard work , the Contes opened stores throughout Milan , and always dreamed of coming to America to share our recipes . That dream is finally here , and I thank all of you for sharing it with us . ”
78677	78721	78648	78648	He	53	“ Family is very important to me . This is something I believe in . The name of La Dolce Famiglia is a sign of my beliefs and my pride in what I hold dear . In what I love above nothing else . ”
78745	78851	78736	78736	his	53	“ I have now discovered a new type of family . I have fallen in love with an incredible woman , one who made me believe in happily ever after . One who cracked my world open and made me whole . But , alas , she does not believe me . Words are not enough to convince her that I need her in my life . That she makes me whole . Therefore , I am proud to reveal my new bakery , and a new chain to open in America , where I have met the woman I want to be my wife . ”
78917	78925	78926	78926	she	52	“ Do n’t you understand , Maggie ? ”
78937	79015	78926	78926	she	52	“ He loves you . It was always you — but you have to be brave enough to reach for it . You have to believe you ’re worth it . That ’s what you told me the day Nick confessed his love for me , remember ? If you love someone , you fight for them , again and again . My best friend is not a coward . You deserve this . You deserve love . ”
79126	79237	79118	79118	His	53	“ My Maggie , mia amore , I love you . I want to live with you , grow old , and have bambinos with you . You wrecked me . Completely . I could never settle for another woman because I ’d be bored out of my mind . Do n’t you understand ? I do n’t want the typical wife you think would make me happy , because you were meant for me , all of you . Your sarcasm , and wit , and sexiness , and honesty . You belong with me , and I wo n’t give up until I finally convince you . Capisce ? ”
79297	79305	79306	79306	she	1627	“ I love you , Michael Conte , ”
79315	79348	79306	79306	she	1627	“ And I want it all . With you , your family , your bakeries , everything . I ’ve always loved you , but I was too afraid to take it . ”
79390	79401	79402	79402	She	1627	“ Maggie , hurry up ! The movers are here ! ”
79483	79486	79487	79487	she	1627	“ Coming ! ”
80731	80754	80755	80755	Max	96	“ I ’ve hired a new associate . She ’ll be under your direction and you will be responsible for her training . ”
80834	80842	80828	80828	he	96	“ Looking to replace me , boss ? ”
80858	80883	80884	80884	Max	96	“ And deal with your mama coming after me to kick my ass ? No such luck . You need help with the expansion . ”
80887	80919	80884	80884	Max	96	“ Seems your mama is tougher than mine . Did n’t she instigate a shotgun wedding with your wife ? Good thing you loved her or you would ’ve been screwed . ”
80920	80945	80946	80946	Max	96	“ Funny , Gray . The wedding was n’t the problem . It was your doubts about my wife that truly screwed us up . ”
80949	80981	80946	80946	Max	96	“ Sorry . Just trying to protect a friend from a money - hungry woman . Anyway , I love Maggie now . She ’s strong enough to take your crap . ”
80982	80997	80884	80884	Max	96	“ Yeah , now it ’s like a mutual admiration club between you two . ”
80998	81012	80884	80884	Max	96	“ Better than war . So , who ’s the hotshot coming in ? ”
81013	81016	81017	81017	Max	96	“ Carina . ”
81023	81048	81017	81017	Max	96	“ Excuse me ? Carina , your baby sister ? You ’ve got to be kidding me . Is n’t she still in school ? ”
81062	81083	81017	81017	Max	96	“ She graduated last May with her MBA from SDA Bocconi and she ’s been training at Dolce di Notte . ”
81084	81088	81089	81089	Michael	53	“ Our competitor ? ”
81092	81171	81089	81089	Michael	53	“ Hardly . They are not looking to conquer the world like us , my friend . But I can trust them to teach her basic skills in the bakery business . I wanted her to train with Julietta but she refuses to lag in her older sister ’s shadow . She ’s been begging me to come to America , and her internship is up . It is time she now join the family company . Capisce ? ”
81244	81296	81297	81298	His friend	2666	“ Umm , Michael , maybe you should put her in accounting . You always said she ’s capable with figures and I do n’t think management is a good fit . I ’ve got a crazy schedule and I ’m in delicate negotiations . Please give her to someone else . ”
81303	81355	81300	81300	his	96	“ Eventually , I will move her to CFO but for now I want her with you . She needs to learn proper management and how La Dolce Maggie works . You ’re the only one I trust to make sure she does n’t get in trouble . You ’re family . ”
81616	81628	81582	81582	Michael	53	“ Okay , Michael , if this is what you want . ”
81629	81661	81706	81706	him	53	“ Good . She ’ll be arriving in about an hour . Why do n’t you come to dinner tonight ? We ’re having a small welcome celebration for her arrival . ”
81662	81667	81668	81668	Michael	53	“ Is Maggie cooking ? ”
81671	81676	81668	81668	Michael	53	“ Hell , no . ”
81677	81683	81706	81706	him	53	“ Then I ’m in . ”
81684	81688	81689	81689	Michael	53	“ Smart man . ”
81812	81816	81820	81820	his	96	“ Come in . ”
81910	81915	81916	81922	The man behind the sprawling teak desk	1705	“ Hello , Max . ”
82234	82242	82228	82228	She	103	“ It ’s been a long time . ”
82243	82249	82253	82253	his	1705	“ Too long , cara . ”
82259	82274	82275	82275	She	103	“ I heard you graduated at the top of your class . Well done . ”
82281	82300	82275	82275	She	103	“ Thank you . And you ? Michael says you ’re working hard on expanding La Dolce Maggie . ”
82305	82327	82301	82301	His	1705	“ Yes . It seems you will be assisting me in this aspect . Have you spoken with your brother yet ? ”
82331	82376	82328	82328	Carina	103	“ No , I came straight to headquarters so I can put in a few hours before settling in . I figured he ’d give me the tour . What division is he starting me with ? Accounts payable , budgeting , or operations ? ”
82465	82468	82506	82506	he	1705	“ Me . ”
82469	82473	82506	82506	he	1705	“ Excuse me ? ”
82474	82494	82506	82506	he	1705	“ Your division . You ’ll be working with me as my assistant . I ’ll be training you . ”
82518	82529	82506	82506	he	1705	“ I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . ”
82537	82565	82506	82506	he	1705	“ I mean , I do n’t want to get in the way . I ’ll speak with Michael and convince him to start me somewhere else . ”
82566	82576	82577	82577	He	1705	“ Do you not want to work with me ? ”
82582	82600	82579	82579	his	1705	“ There ’s nothing to worry about , Carina . I will take good care of you . ”
82756	82765	82766	82766	she	103	“ I appreciate your willingness to train me , ”
82770	82779	82766	82766	she	103	“ But I ’d feel more comfortable elsewhere . ”
82784	82825	82766	82766	she	103	“ Suit yourself . But I think your brother has a clear idea what he wants . Why do n’t I give you a brief tour while I ring him ? I do n’t think he expected you until later . ”
82826	82829	82830	82830	She	103	“ Fine . ”
82837	82855	82832	82832	her	103	“ Perhaps it ’s time to remind my brother he is no longer in charge of me . ”
83520	83554	83509	83509	Michael	53	“ I ’m so happy you are finally here , mia bella . I told my driver to take you directly to the house , though . Maggie has been waiting for you . ”
83563	83575	83557	83557	her	103	“ And how is my sister - in - law doing ? ”
83576	83579	83580	83580	She	103	“ Cranky . ”
83583	83630	83580	83580	She	103	“ Do you blame her ? I told your driver there was a change in plans . I figured I ’d grab a tour , set up my desk , and then head to your house . Max gave me a brief overview of the layout . ”
83638	83686	83631	83631	Michael	53	“ You ’re in good hands . Why do n’t you take the office next to his ? It ’s been empty for a while , and I ’ll get the boxes cleared out today . We ’ll hold a strategy meeting tomorrow on some new developments . ”
83707	83729	83730	83730	Max	96	“ Yes , it seems we need to lay out some ground rules first . Can we meet in your office ? ”
83733	83744	83730	83730	Max	96	“ I ’ll leave you two and catch up tonight . ”
83745	83758	83759	83759	Carina	103	“ No , Max . I ’d like you to join us , ”
83908	83911	83907	83911	the “ hot librarian ”	2738	“ hot librarian ”
83957	83989	83951	83951	He	53	“ Michael , I have some concerns about my place here . Maybe you can let me know what you see as my role and we can make the necessary adjustments . ”
84013	84104	84105	84105	Michael	53	“ You should not worry about this , cara . Eventually you will take the position of CFO , but for now you will assist Max in all aspects of running La Dolce Maggie . I need you to learn all levels of the operation first . Of course , you will live with Maggie and me . I ’ve set up a private suite and you may decorate it any way you ’d like . When you have concerns , come to me and we will work it out . ”
84136	84231	84133	84133	Carina	103	“ I see . Well , that is quite generous of you and I appreciate the offer . Unfortunately , I did not come to New York to live in my brother ’s house and shadow his CEO . I have my own plans . I ’m moving into Alexa ’s old loft apartment this weekend . As for La Dolce Maggie , I think I ’ll serve the company better in accounting and operations since that will be my permanent position . Max does not need someone distracting him from his role here . ”
84384	84431	84379	84379	Michael	53	“ Absolutely not . You are my sister and will stay with us . New York is a scary place . As for the company , I do not need another person in the accounting department at the moment . You will learn more from Max . ”
84432	84435	84436	84436	She	103	“ No . ”
84452	84455	84441	84441	her	103	“ What ? ”
84456	84587	84588	84588	Max	96	“ You are not listening to me , Michael . If we ca n’t communicate in an adult manner , it ’s not going to work out . I ’ve already received two job offers in Manhattan and I have n’t given them my final decision . I want to prove my worth here , but if you continue to treat me like a little sister , I wo n’t be able to do my job properly . This would not be fair to anyone . Now , if you have a valid reason other than wanting Max to keep an eye on me and out of trouble , I ’d like to hear it . If not , I will happily move onward with no hurt feelings . Capisce ? ”
84684	84759	84681	84681	his	53	“ Very well , cara . I want you to stay in my home because Maggie will enjoy your company . We can show you around until you become more comfortable in your surroundings . As for the company , I know your skills exceed with figures but I need you to get training in all aspects , most especially management . Max is the only one I trust to properly hone your skills . ”
84776	84847	84848	84848	He	96	“ Very well , I agree that Max will be the best person . I ’ve missed Maggie , too , so I ’ll stay for the whole week . But then I really need to move — living with my older brother is not what I expected when I came out here . It ’s time I get my own place and Alexa ’s loft sounds perfect . Agreed ? ”
84869	84872	84863	84863	Max	96	“ Agreed . ”
84885	84908	84873	84873	They	1763	“ Now let me hit the restroom . And would you take me home ? I ’m exhausted and need to change . ”
84909	84934	84863	84863	Max	96	“ Of course . We are having a small dinner party to celebrate your arrival , but you ’ll have a chance to nap . ”
84935	84938	84939	84939	She	1766	“ Wonderful . ”
84952	84967	84939	84939	She	1766	“ Thank you for the tour , Max . I will see you tonight . ”
84993	85033	84982	84982	She	1766	“ What the hell was that about ? Why are n’t you laying down the law like you always do ? And what happened to her ? She has n’t cried or gotten upset once since she ’s arrived . ”
85048	85092	85036	85036	his	53	“ Maggie convinced me she needs to be respected as an individual in order to make her own decisions . Do I hate it ? Si . But she ’s a grown - up now , and needs to find her own way . ”
85097	85141	85036	85036	his	53	“ I am her brother , not her papa . But I appreciate you keeping an eye on her , mi amico . I trust you to keep her safe and help her learn what she needs in order to run this company . ”
85148	85153	85154	85154	Michael	53	“ Run the company ? ”
85157	85187	85154	85154	Michael	53	“ Of course . She is a Conte and will one day take the full reigns of La Dolce Maggie . That is what we are training her for . ”
85299	85312	85317	85317	him	53	“ I shall see you at seven tonight . Thanks , Max . ”
