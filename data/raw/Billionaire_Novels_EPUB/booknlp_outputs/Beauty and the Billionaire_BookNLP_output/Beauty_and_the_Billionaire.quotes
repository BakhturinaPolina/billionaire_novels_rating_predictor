364	366	639	644	A soft , pleasant female voice	169	“ IM ”
632	638	639	644	A soft , pleasant female voice	169	“ What is this place ? ”
647	652	668	670	The other woman	170	“ It ’s lovely . ”
653	667	681	681	her	170	“ Some dead celebrity ’s home or something . I do n’t care . ”
686	712	721	722	The women	171	“ All I care about is how we ’re supposed to get these damned boxes back to SoHo . What the heck was Audrey thinking ? ”
713	720	827	828	the redhead	173	“ Could we call a cab ? ”
817	826	827	828	the redhead	173	“ I do n’t know about a cab , ”
831	847	852	856	the dark - haired one	178	“ That ’ll clean us out , and I still want to order that pizza . ”
848	851	863	864	the redhead	173	“ So ? ”
859	862	884	885	the redhead	173	“ Brontë , ”
890	908	863	864	the redhead	173	“ You have to understand something about my sister . She ’s not the most practical creature . ”
909	920	972	972	She	173	“ She ’s not ? She seems practical to me . ”
921	971	985	985	she	173	“ Not when it comes to work . She thinks we ’re mules or something , as evidenced by all this . And if I need to call and gripe at her to get her in line , then , by golly , I ’m going to do it . ”
991	1021	1030	1031	the brunette	181	“ Voice mail . I ca n’t believe her . She said there were two boxes . Not five boxes of hardbacks . Does she think we ’re bodybuilders ? ”
1022	1029	1030	1031	the brunette	181	“ It ’s not that bad , ”
1042	1050	1058	1059	the redhead	173	“ I ’m sure we can manage . ”
1051	1057	1058	1059	the redhead	173	“ I blame Logan Hawkings , ”
1067	1081	1058	1059	the redhead	173	“ He thinks the world just belongs to him , does n’t he ? ”
1093	1097	1122	1123	The brunette	181	“ I suppose . ”
1098	1121	1122	1123	The brunette	181	“ Ugh . Look at that hang - dog expression . You ’re still in love with him , are n’t you ? ”
1131	1163	1191	1192	The redhead	173	“ ‘ I hate and I love . Perhaps you ask why I do so . I do not know , but I feel it , and am in agony . ’ ”
1164	1190	1247	1247	she	173	“ Oh , quit quoting that crap at me . You ’re being dramatic . He ’s a jerk . You ’ll get over him . ”
1255	1288	1301	1301	Brontë	59	“ Save me from rich , attractive alpha males . They think they ’re the heroes from a fairy tale . Little do they know , they ’re more like the villains . ”
1289	1297	1311	1311	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s not fair , Gretchen , ”
1304	1310	1346	1346	She	58	“ Life ’s not fair , ”
1319	1345	1346	1346	She	58	“ I ’d rather have a man who is n’t in love with his own reflection than one who needs hair product or designer labels . ”
1370	1394	1399	1399	Gretchen	58	“ So you ’d rather have a pizza guy with a weak chin and a knight - in - shining - armor complex ? ”
1395	1398	1427	1427	she	58	“ Yes , ”
1413	1425	1720	1720	Logan	55	“ His looks are n’t half as important as his brain . ”
1714	1719	1720	1720	Logan	55	“ What is it ? ”
1723	1733	1754	1754	Hunter	57	“ I ’m about to head into a meeting . ”
1734	1753	1774	1774	Logan	55	“ There ca n’t be more than one ‘ Brontë ’ running around New York , can there ? ”
1770	1773	1774	1774	Logan	55	“ Brontë ? ”
1780	1789	1810	1810	they	171	“ You saw her ? Where is she ? ”
1814	1832	1839	1839	Logan	55	“ She just left with a redhead named Gretchen . I want to know more about her . ”
1833	1838	1839	1839	Logan	55	“ About my Brontë ? ”
1846	1861	1810	1810	they	171	“ No . Gretchen . The one with red hair . I want her . ”
1862	1865	1810	1810	they	171	“ Oh . ”
1870	1896	1897	1897	Logan	55	“ Sorry , man . Have n’t been myself lately . She left me , and I ’ve been going crazy trying to find her . ”
1905	1921	1933	1933	Hunter	57	“ I ca n’t believe she ’s still in New York . Where are you ? ”
1922	1932	2008	2008	Hunter	57	“ At the townhouse on the Upper East Side . ”
1994	2007	2008	2008	Hunter	57	“ Your assistant did n’t come by to pick up the boxes , ”
2014	2026	2034	2034	Logan	55	“ This Gretchen did , and your Brontë was with her . ”
2027	2033	2034	2034	Logan	55	“ I have to go , ”
2037	2049	2060	2060	Hunter	57	“ I ’ll call Audrey and see who she sent over . ”
2050	2059	2076	2076	Logan	55	“ Send me information about this Gretchen woman , ”
2068	2075	2076	2076	Logan	55	“ I will . And thanks . ”
2086	2092	2098	2098	Hunter	57	“ I owe you one . ”
2093	2097	2098	2098	Hunter	57	“ You do , ”
2101	2117	2696	2696	she	173	“ Just get me information on her friend , and we ’ll call it even . ”
2700	2733	2748	2748	he	55	“ Save me from rich , attractive alpha males . They think they ’re the heroes from a fairy tale . Little do they know , they ’re more like the villains . ”
2743	2747	2748	2748	he	55	“ Your friend , ”
2753	2762	2763	2763	She	173	“ The redhead . Tell me about her . ”
2782	2787	2792	2792	He	55	“ You mean Gretchen ? ”
2788	2791	2799	2799	he	55	“ Yes . ”
2807	2814	2763	2763	She	173	“ What is her last name ? ”
2815	2825	2843	2843	She	173	“ Why ? How do you know about Gretchen ? ”
2826	2842	2843	2843	She	173	“ I saw her with you the other day . Tell me more about her . ”
2848	2863	2885	2886	a man	189	“ Why should I tell you about Gretchen ? So you can stalk her ? ”
2892	2905	2945	2945	her	173	“ I am an admirer of hers . . . from afar . ”
2906	2911	2945	2945	her	173	“ Like a stalker . ”
2912	2926	2937	2937	Hunter	57	“ Not a stalker . I simply wish to know more about her . ”
2927	2936	2963	2963	He	57	“ That ’s what a stalker would say . ”
2967	2987	3032	3032	Brontë	59	“ Your friend is quite safe from my romantic interests . I simply wish to learn more about her . ”
3028	3031	3032	3032	Brontë	59	“ Oh , ”
3044	3057	3074	3074	author	239	“ Petty . Her last name is Petty . She writes books . ”
3081	3087	3101	3101	her	59	“ What kinds of books ? ”
3088	3098	3125	3125	Brontë	59	“ Books with other people ’s names on them . ”
3119	3124	3125	3125	Brontë	59	“ A ghost writer ? ”
3128	3141	3125	3125	Brontë	59	“ That ’s right . And Cooper ’s in love with her . ”
3142	3149	3220	3220	He	57	“ Cooper ? Who is Cooper ? ”
3176	3219	3321	3321	he	57	“ Cooper ’s her friend . It ’s okay , though . He wo n’t make a move . He knows Gretchen is n’t interested in him that way . Gretchen likes guys who are different . She likes to be challenged . ”
3316	3320	3468	3468	She	59	“ Gretchen Petty , ”
3472	3496	4808	4809	Gretchen Petty	58	“ I ’d rather have a man not in love with his own reflection than one that needs hair product or designer labels . ”
4818	4838	4843	4844	Kat Garvey	77	“ Do you suppose if I take enough of these home , it ’ll make me a decent dinner ? ”
4859	4869	4877	4877	Gretchen	58	“ Stop it . You ’re not that broke . ”
4870	4876	4877	4877	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m almost there , ”
4892	4908	4922	4922	Kat	77	“ The cupboard ’s bare , and I ’m weeks away from an acceptance payment . ”
4909	4921	4926	4926	Gretchen	58	“ So I take it lunch is on me this time ? ”
4936	4950	4986	4986	her	77	“ Why , Kat . It is so generous of you to offer . ”
4951	4971	4983	4983	Kat	77	“ Do n’t thank me . I ’m taking it directly off the top of your next royalty check . ”
4972	4982	5090	5090	Kat	77	“ In that case , I ’m ordering dessert . ”
5068	5089	5090	5090	Kat	77	“ So how ’s the book coming , Gretchen ? As your agent , I ’m obligated to ask you . ”
5098	5108	5118	5118	Gretchen	58	“ I know it ’s not your favorite project . ”
5109	5117	5149	5149	Kat	77	“ Favorite would be a grand overstatement , ”
5129	5148	5149	5149	Kat	77	“ Something more like ‘ greatest torture known to mankind ’ would probably be closer to the mark . ”
5152	5156	5224	5224	Kat	77	“ That well ? ”
5230	5248	5253	5253	Gretchen	58	“ Are we on track to turn in at the end of the month , at least ? ”
5249	5252	5259	5259	her	58	“ Mmmmmsure . ”
5268	5279	5284	5284	Kat	77	“ Or a week or so after . Maybe two . ”
5280	5283	5284	5284	Kat	77	“ Gretchen , ”
5289	5307	5375	5375	Gretchen	58	“ Are you serious ? This is the fourth project you ’ve been late on this year . ”
5363	5374	5375	5375	Gretchen	58	“ I had to do a lot of science research , ”
5378	5421	5433	5433	Kat	77	“ For Astronaut Bill and the Space Vixens of Dark Planet ? Are you kidding me ? It ’s pulp , Gretchen ! Granted , it ’s pulp with a huge following , but it ’s still freaking pulp . Just write . ”
5422	5432	5433	5433	Kat	77	“ Yeah , but have you read those books ? ”
5436	5441	5375	5375	Gretchen	58	“ Not my type . ”
5442	5505	5513	5513	Kat	77	“ Yeah , well that makes two of us . I had to read a few of them , too . And you know what happens in Astronaut Bill Conquers the Moon Maidens ? He razes the planet of all greenery . All greenery , Kat ! How the hell are they supposed to breathe if there ’s nothing to produce oxygen ? ”
5506	5512	5513	5513	Kat	77	“ It ’s space fantasy . ”
5521	5531	5541	5541	Gretchen	58	“ Write in some robot oxygen makers or something . ”
5532	5540	5541	5541	Gretchen	58	“ But it has to make sense , ”
5544	5564	5690	5690	Gretchen	58	“ I ca n’t just phone it in . I ca n’t write loopholes like that in the story . ”
5650	5689	5690	5690	Gretchen	58	“ I do n’t know why you get so hung up on that misogynistic crap , Gretchen . Just finish the book and have the copyeditor fill in the holes . That ’s what they ’re there for . ”
5696	5720	5690	5690	Gretchen	58	“ You know if you turn in late again , they wo n’t re - up your contract . You need this contract . ”
5721	5733	5868	5868	Kat	77	“ I know . I ’m just . . . struggling . ”
5846	5867	5868	5868	Kat	77	“ Just tell them I ’m sick . Maybe someone died and I had to leave town for the funeral . ”
5873	5896	5868	5868	Kat	77	“ I ’m not going to lie about your family . I ’ll just tell them you need another week , max . ”
5897	5900	5906	5906	Kat	77	“ Two ? ”
5901	5905	5906	5906	Kat	77	“ One week , ”
5910	5926	5932	5932	Gretchen	58	“ But you know they run on tight deadlines and they wo n’t be happy . ”
5927	5931	5932	5932	Gretchen	58	“ I know , ”
5954	5964	5906	5906	Kat	77	“ I ’ll get it finished , I promise . ”
5965	5997	6007	6007	Kat	77	“ Gretchen , you know I adore you , girl . You ’re my favorite client . But I say this with love — you need to get your act together . ”
5998	6006	6007	6007	Kat	77	“ Consider it together . I promise . ”
6014	6033	6038	6038	Gretchen	58	“ Well , did you want to hear about another ghostwriting contract ? They asked for you specifically . ”
6034	6037	6038	6038	Gretchen	58	“ Me ? ”
6045	6049	6072	6072	Her	58	“ You serious ? ”
6050	6071	6072	6072	Her	58	“ Yeah , I do n’t know . Do you have connections at any publishers I do n’t know about ? ”
6078	6085	6007	6007	Kat	77	“ Especially brand - new ones ? ”
6086	6092	6007	6007	Kat	77	“ Brand - new ones ? ”
6093	6138	6007	6007	Kat	77	“ Yeah , someone ’s launching a small publishing line . I do n’t know anything about it other than they headhunted one of the best editors I know to head it up , and for their launch title they want you on board . ”
6150	6156	6191	6191	Gretchen	58	“ I do n’t understand . ”
6157	6190	6335	6335	Gretchen	58	“ Me either , kiddo . But they were very clear that they wanted you on this project . Said you had a reputation for ghostwriting and they wanted you on board . ”
6343	6357	6366	6366	Gretchen	58	“ So what kind of job is it and what does it pay ? ”
6358	6365	6366	6366	Gretchen	58	“ It pays three hundred grand . ”
6374	6384	6335	6335	Gretchen	58	“ Three . . . hundred grand ? Seriously ? ”
6385	6397	6335	6335	Gretchen	58	“ So I ’m told . Lead title , you know . ”
6398	6417	6366	6366	Gretchen	58	“ And this is a legit publisher ? Really ? They ’re putting out that kind of money ? ”
6418	6448	6503	6503	Kat	77	“ Yeah . Weird terms , though . Ten percent up front , ninety percent upon turn in of an acceptable manuscript . And that ’s not the weirdest . ”
6496	6502	6508	6508	She	77	“ What else is weird ? ”
6514	6523	6508	6508	She	77	“ Well , there are unusual working terms . ”
6524	6539	6508	6508	She	77	“ Uh - oh . Am I going to like the sound of this ? ”
6540	6652	6668	6668	She	77	“ Probably not , which is why I did n’t mention it when we first sat down . It ’s strange , Gretch . Really strange . Apparently the project they want you to do is an epistolary novel of sorts . There ’s some old letters someone found in an attic of a very old , very famous mansion . The publisher said the letters were really romantic , so they ’re seeing this as some sort of quasi Anne Frank meets The Notebook sort of project . They think it ’ll be huge . But there ’s a catch . You ca n’t take the letters off the property . ”
6653	6667	6508	6508	She	77	“ Okay , that ’s a little picky , but do - able . ”
6704	6713	6508	6508	She	77	“ Who ’s name am I writing under ? ”
6714	6734	6508	6508	She	77	“ Do n’t know yet . They did n’t want to release it until the project was agreed upon . ”
6735	6742	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ So where ’s this house ? ”
6743	6746	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ Mansion , ”
6750	6758	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ And it ’s in Hyde Park . ”
6764	6773	6508	6508	She	77	“ Like . . . the Vanderbilt one ? ”
6774	6791	6508	6508	She	77	“ Close . You know the one with the white columns and the crazy rose gardens ? ”
6792	6806	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ Holy shit . Yes , I know that one . Buchanan Manor . ”
6807	6822	6830	6830	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s the one . And that ’s the location of our letters . ”
6823	6829	6830	6830	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s so cool , ”
6835	6844	6508	6508	She	77	“ I ’m totally in on this project . ”
6845	6855	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ I think you need to think about it . ”
6856	6885	6830	6830	Gretchen	58	“ Why ? The money ’s awesome , the house is fascinating , and it ’s a lead title . What is it you ’re not telling me ? ”
6886	6907	6508	6508	She	77	“ It ’s the house . You heard the part about the letters not being able to leave the premises ? ”
6908	6947	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ Yeah , but what ’s the big deal ? I ’ll just drop in on some weekdays and take photos . I do n’t mind going on location if the pay is right — which it is . ”
6948	7022	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ You ’re going to be very on location . As in , if you take the job , they want you to live on site for the duration of the project . They do n’t want you coming back and forth . The owner ’s a bit of a recluse and does n’t seem to like traffic much , so he ’s insisting that the ghostwriter live on the premises with him . ”
7023	7027	6830	6830	Gretchen	58	“ Do what ? ”
7028	7051	6747	6747	Kat	77	“ Live . On site . With the owner . He ’s the one who does n’t want them leaving the premises . ”
7052	7060	7085	7085	She	353	“ That ’s a little . . . ”
7061	7084	7109	7110	a stranger	356	“ Creepy ? I know . That ’s what I said and that ’s why I think you should turn it down . ”
7122	7132	7138	7138	Kat	77	“ Exactly how many letters are there , again ? ”
7133	7137	7138	7138	Kat	77	“ Several hundred . ”
7145	7155	7161	7161	she	353	“ You ’re not considering it , are you ? ”
7156	7160	7161	7161	she	353	“ Not seriously , ”
7164	7195	7220	7220	Gretchen	58	“ Though it would be cool to visit the house and see what it ’s like on the inside . And the money would be nice . But . . . ”
7196	7219	7255	7255	Kat	77	“ Yeah , it ’s that ‘ but ’ that makes me keep pausing . You want me to turn them down ? ”
7250	7254	7263	7263	She	58	“ Not yet . ”
7258	7262	7263	7263	She	58	“ Suit yourself . ”
7289	7298	7321	7321	she	58	“ And they asked for me , huh ? ”
7299	7314	7334	7334	Gretchen	58	“ Who knows . Maybe the recluse is a big fan of Astronaut Bill . ”
7347	7354	7375	7376	Astronaut Bill	69	“ You going to eat that ? ”
7358	7374	7398	7398	Her	58	“ Never worry , Uranea . I ’ll stop them with my trusty laser sword . ”
7404	7414	7425	7425	Bill	69	“ Oh , please be safe , Astronaut Bill ! ”
7415	7424	7437	7437	Uranea	74	“ They wo n’t know what hit them , ”
7449	7468	7656	7656	Cooper	62	“ Now I ’ll send them on a one - way ticket back to the stars . . . ”
7676	7688	7989	7989	he	362	“ I ’ll get it , Gretch . You ’re busy . ”
7981	7988	7989	7989	he	362	“ How ’s the book coming ? ”
7992	7998	8034	8034	she	58	“ Still giving you trouble ? ”
8023	8033	8034	8034	she	58	“ Oh , just struggling with a love scene , ”
8038	8045	8180	8180	she	58	“ You know how it goes . ”
8167	8179	8180	8180	she	58	“ Actually , I need to get this scene knocked out , ”
8200	8216	8222	8222	Cooper	62	“ If it ’s okay with you , I ’m going to head out early . ”
8217	8221	8222	8222	Cooper	62	“ Of course , ”
8225	8238	8351	8351	She	58	“ Oh , and I wanted to talk to you about something . ”
8373	8405	8430	8430	She	58	“ Can it wait , Coop ? I really do need to get going . The cookies will be ready in a few minutes , if you can pull them out . ”
8406	8429	8440	8440	He	261	“ Oh , sure . I was just going to let you know that I think you ’ll like your next check . ”
8436	8439	8440	8440	He	261	“ Why ? ”
8445	8452	8482	8482	his	261	“ I gave you a raise . ”
8453	8465	8482	8482	his	261	“ A raise ? Why ? I ’m your worst employee . ”
8466	8478	8482	8482	his	261	“ Do n’t say that . You ’re my favorite employee . ”
8523	8565	8584	8584	She	58	“ You should n’t give me a raise , Coop . Anyone else would have fired me at this point . I ’m late , I ’m lazy , and I work on other stuff when I ’m tending the counter . ”
8566	8583	8584	8584	She	58	“ Yes , but you make an incredible cookie . All the customers love your recipes . ”
8587	8602	8482	8482	his	261	“ Did you not hear me say the part about being late and lazy ? ”
8603	8611	8625	8625	He	383	“ Yes , but you work hard . ”
8612	8624	8625	8625	He	383	“ On my books , yes . Not on slinging coffee . ”
8628	8641	8649	8649	she	58	“ You should n’t tell me that . I ’m your boss . ”
8642	8648	8690	8690	she	58	“ You ’re my friend , ”
8671	8689	8720	8720	his	383	“ Actually , I wanted to tell you that I might be scarce for a few weeks , ”
8727	8743	8748	8748	He	383	“ I just got handed another contract and it ’s an on - location one . ”
8744	8747	8748	8748	He	383	“ Oh ? ”
8752	8760	8767	8767	She	58	“ I ’ll miss seeing you around . ”
8761	8766	8767	8767	She	58	“ Yeah , well . ”
8779	8796	8801	8801	he	383	“ I ’m sorry . Debbie always wants more shifts . Can you give her mine ? ”
8797	8800	8801	8801	he	383	“ Hey , ”
8817	8840	8801	8801	he	383	“ Do n’t stress . You do what needs to be done . You know I ’ll always be here for you . ”
8844	8861	8876	8876	his	383	“ Thanks , Cooper . You ’re a good friend . I really do mean that . ”
8862	8868	8921	8921	she	58	“ I know you do . ”
8930	8944	8951	8951	he	383	“ I appreciate it , Cooper . Sorry to run out on you . ”
8945	8950	8991	8991	Gretchen	58	“ Not a problem , ”
8982	8990	9007	9007	He	383	“ I ’m going to head out , ”
8999	9006	9064	9065	her agent	334	“ See you around , Coop . ”
9067	9071	9036	9036	his	383	“ Kat Geary . ”
9072	9090	9057	9057	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s me . Is that weird - ass job at the Buchanan place still available ? ”
9091	9104	9064	9065	her agent	334	“ You ’re not seriously thinking about taking it , are you ? ”
9105	9110	9462	9462	Audrey	56	“ I sure am . ”
9201	9223	9462	9462	Audrey	56	“ I could use a distraction and this project sounds like the perfect one . When do I get to start ? ”
9224	9248	9462	9462	Audrey	56	“ As soon as we get a handshake on it . Gretchen , are you sure ? It means living on the premises . ”
9249	9266	9462	9462	Audrey	56	“ Yeah , but I ’ve seen the outside of the house . It ’s huge . ”
9267	9281	9337	9337	Kat	77	“ What if it ’s filled with coffins and decapitated doll heads inside ? ”
9282	9336	9337	9337	Kat	77	“ Jeez , Kat . You been trolling through the horror fiction section lately ? It ’s a mansion . I ’m sure it ’ll be fine . It ’s probably so big that I wo n’t see anyone ever . It ’ll just be me and some dusty library . No big . ”
9344	9371	9462	9462	Audrey	56	“ Well , as your friend , I think you ’re crazy . As your agent , I just want to say thanks for the commission . ”
9372	9397	9400	9400	Gretchen	58	“ You ’re welcome . I think . Now , can you call my Astronaut Bill editor and tell her I need an extension ? ”
9420	9445	9460	9461	her sister	348	“ Holy doughnuts . This place is insane . I ca n’t believe I ’m going to be living here for the next month . ”
9446	9455	9462	9462	Audrey	56	“ I ca n’t believe it , either . ”
9470	9488	9518	9519	Her sister	348	“ The money is good , but I still think you ’re crazy for taking this job . ”
9499	9517	9518	9519	Her sister	348	“ It ’s a pretty lucrative job , Audrey . And you did n’t have to come . ”
9525	9643	9518	9519	Her sister	348	“ Oh , yes I did . You have n’t met Buchanan . I have . He ’s surly and unpleasant and that house is a mausoleum . It ’s bad enough that you ’re taking a job that forces you to live in someone else ’s home . I do n’t care if he ’s Mr. Hawkings ’s best friend — I’m not letting you shack up without checking out the place first . That ’s so they know you have someone looking out for you . I do n’t want to have you disappear for a month and then we ’re calling the news and insisting that someone digs up the gardens looking for you . ”
9649	9658	9659	9659	Audrey	56	“ I ’ll probably never see the man . ”
9667	9685	9659	9659	Audrey	56	“ Do n’t argue with me . You know I ’m the responsible one in this family . ”
9735	9768	9776	9776	Audrey	56	“ I do n’t think they ’d bury me in the backyard , Audrey . Did you see the landscaping ? It probably costs more than we both make in a month . ”
9769	9775	9794	9794	Gretchen	58	“ If you need money , ”
9785	9793	9794	9794	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s not just the money , ”
9797	9813	9659	9659	Audrey	56	“ It ’s an adventure . Have n’t you ever wanted to have an adventure ? ”
9814	9826	9836	9837	the owner	1852	“ Not if it involves living with a stranger , no . ”
9859	9876	10105	10105	Audrey	56	“ Look at the size of this place . Odds are that I never see him . ”
10099	10104	10105	10105	Audrey	56	“ This is uncomfortable . ”
10118	10125	10105	10105	Audrey	56	“ Where ’s all your bravery ? ”
10126	10144	10231	10232	the man	1893	“ I did n’t realize I was going to be living at frickin ’ Hogwarts ! I — ”
10226	10230	10231	10232	the man	1893	“ Good afternoon , ”
10239	10249	10250	10250	She	58	“ Which one of you is Ms. Gretchen Petty ? ”
10255	10258	10296	10296	He	1893	“ Here . ”
10274	10295	10317	10317	her	56	“ I brought my sister for the weekend so she can see me settled . I hope that ’s okay ? ”
10327	10381	10485	10485	He	1893	“ My employer is Logan Hawkings , a friend of Mr. Buchanan ’s . When I told Mr. Hawkings that we would be coming here for the weekend , he told me that he had cleared it with Mr. Buchanan and that it would not be a problem for me to tag along . ”
10459	10484	10513	10513	Gretchen	58	“ I am aware of Mr. Hawkings ’s involvement . If you would please follow me , I can show you to your rooms . ”
10507	10512	10545	10545	She	58	“ No , no , ”
10517	10544	10560	10560	Audrey	56	“ Do n’t bother . I can carry all the bags . There are Amazons in my ancestry , after all . Me strong like bull . ”
10572	10578	10616	10616	him	1893	“ Shut up , already . ”
10590	10612	10706	10709	The gentleman escorting them	437	“ Come on . The world ’s friendliest butler there does n’t look like he ’s going to wait on us . ”
10699	10705	10706	10709	The gentleman escorting them	437	“ This place is gorgeous . ”
10720	10726	10770	10770	him	1893	“ Of course it is . ”
10727	10739	10749	10749	He	1893	“ I was n’t insulting the place , I was just — ”
10740	10748	10804	10804	Gretchen	58	“ Talking . Yes , I noticed . ”
10790	10803	10804	10804	Gretchen	58	“ Gee , I hope he ’s in charge of the tour , ”
10809	10818	10896	10896	he	439	“ He ’s got some incredible people skills . ”
10884	10894	10914	10914	Gretchen	58	“ I have prepared only one room for guests . ”
10904	10913	10914	10914	Gretchen	58	“ Oh , it ’s not a problem , ”
10918	10944	11084	11085	the butler	439	“ It must be terribly difficult to find space around here . You must only have thirty or forty guest bedrooms . I totally understand . ”
11074	11083	11112	11112	she	58	“ I trust that this suits your needs ? ”
11104	11111	11112	11112	she	58	“ It ’s a little small , ”
11115	11121	11148	11148	Audrey	56	“ but it ’ll suit . ”
11122	11147	11159	11160	the butler	439	“ I ’ll give you a few hours to get settled . Dinner is in two hours and will be brought to your room . ”
11162	11172	11179	11179	Gretchen	58	“ Do we get a tour of the place ? ”
11173	11178	11179	11179	Gretchen	58	“ And the letters , ”
11182	11192	11212	11212	He	439	“ When do I get to look at those ? ”
11193	11211	11212	11212	He	439	“ The letters are in the south wing , and the south wing is off limits today . ”
11222	11246	11257	11257	Gretchen	58	“ If you need anything else , ring the bell pull . My name is Mr. Eldon . You can ask for me . ”
11247	11256	11274	11274	he	439	“ Why is the south wing off limits ? ”
11267	11273	11310	11310	Audrey	56	“ Because today is Friday , ”
11298	11309	11310	11310	Audrey	56	“ Well . The rich do surround themselves with eccentrics , ”
11313	11327	11346	11346	Gretchen	58	“ Maybe he ’s very good at being a butler . Or something . ”
11328	11345	11346	11346	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m hoping it ’s more along the lines of ‘ old family friend ’ , ”
11350	11376	11384	11384	Audrey	56	“ Because that ’ll excuse his behavior a little more . Do you think the owner does n’t want me here to do this project ? ”
11377	11383	11384	11384	Audrey	56	“ I do n’t know , ”
11406	11430	11435	11435	Gretchen	58	“ They invited you here , did n’t they ? So the Buchanan family must be aware that you ’re here to work . ”
11431	11434	11564	11564	Eldon	84	“ Huh . ”
11574	11586	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ She is here , and she is settled , sir . ”
11610	11616	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ Did she seem pleased ? ”
11628	11650	11593	11593	his	57	“ Pleased ? I suppose . She asked to see the letters and I told her the wing was off limits . ”
11651	11658	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ You can show her tomorrow . ”
11659	11668	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ Shall I leave the honor to you ? ”
11669	11679	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ I . . . no . Not yet . ”
11719	11727	11735	11735	Eldon	84	“ I shall introduce myself in time . ”
11728	11734	11735	11735	Eldon	84	“ Very well , sir . ”
11749	11754	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ What is it ? ”
11755	11764	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ She has brought her sister with her . ”
11765	11771	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ I have no objections . ”
11772	11775	11784	11784	Eldon	84	“ Yes . ”
11792	11797	11800	11800	his	57	“ And a cat . ”
11810	11832	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ A cat is permissible . I did not state in the contract if she had to leave any pets behind . ”
11833	11837	11853	11853	Eldon	84	“ I see . ”
11838	11852	11853	11853	Eldon	84	“ And have you set up the letters for Ms. Petty ’s project ? ”
11859	11881	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ They have been placed in an authentic Buchanan trunk dating from the Victorian era and left in the Blue Library . ”
11882	11918	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ And you reviewed them to verify their accuracy ? This has to seem like a legitimate project , Eldon . I do n’t want her leaving early because she realizes it ’s a scam . ”
11919	11965	11853	11853	Eldon	84	“ I have been assured of the age and accuracy of the letters by the gentleman who sold them to me . He insisted that they have been in his family for generations and was only willing to part with them for a large sum . ”
11966	12000	11617	11618	The butler	439	“ I do n’t care about how much they cost . I just want it to be enough to keep her here for a few weeks so I can get to know her . ”
12001	12014	12015	12015	Eldon	84	“ You may trust that it is under control , Mr. Buchanan . ”
12028	12043	11853	11853	Eldon	84	“ This does , however , bring me to the question of the publisher . ”
12044	12048	12090	12090	He	84	“ The publisher ? ”
12049	12089	12122	12122	he	84	“ The one you formed to push Ms. Petty ’s project ? You hired Mr. Stewart from his publishing house and told him to acquire employees and projects as long as Ms. Petty ’s book was given premium attention . ”
12132	12140	12163	12163	Hunter	57	“ Is there a problem with Stewart ? ”
12141	12162	12172	12172	He	57	“ I believe he wanted to discuss Bellefleur Publishing with you and get your opinion on some of the acquisitions . ”
12183	12192	12122	12122	he	84	“ Have him talk with my accounting people . ”
12193	12209	12172	12172	He	57	“ They are not fans of this project , just so you know , sir . ”
12210	12218	12172	12172	He	57	“ Why does it matter to them ? ”
12229	12248	12273	12273	Hunter	57	“ I believe one does not go into publishing with the expectation of making large amounts of money . ”
12249	12272	12273	12273	Hunter	57	“ Then it ’s a good thing that I did n’t go into this expecting to make money , is n’t it ? ”
12277	12304	12374	12374	she	466	“ Tell him to contact my accountants . And tell my accountants to give the man whatever he needs to run his business — within reason . ”
12379	12391	12404	12404	He	57	“ You met Gretchen , Eldon . Tell me your thoughts . ”
12392	12403	12419	12419	he	57	“ It is not for me to say , sir . ”
12422	12430	12519	12519	his	84	“ She seemed . . . strong . ”
12522	12535	12519	12519	his	84	“ Will our house guests affect the cleaning schedule , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
12536	12543	12519	12519	his	84	“ No , they will not . ”
12544	12557	12565	12565	His	57	“ Then I shall be off to resume my duties , sir . ”
12558	12564	13338	13338	Gretchen	58	“ Thank you , Eldon . ”
13333	13337	13435	13435	They	519	“ Hi there , ”
13413	13419	13483	13483	she	58	“ You guys work here ? ”
13473	13482	13483	13483	she	58	“ I ’m staying in the east wing , ”
13487	13496	13509	13510	one woman	520	“ Working . Nice to see you all . ”
13497	13508	13509	13510	one woman	520	“ No one ’s supposed to be in this wing , ”
13516	13521	13528	13528	She	58	“ Today ’s Saturday . ”
13522	13527	13533	13533	everyone	457	“ Umm , okay . ”
13543	13556	13564	13565	another woman	527	“ Why ca n’t we be in the west wing today again ? ”
13557	13563	13564	13565	another woman	527	“ Because it ’s Saturday , ”
13568	13577	13587	13588	The woman	528	“ Off limits except to the cleaning crew . ”
13578	13586	13587	13588	The woman	528	“ Yeah , okay , but why ? ”
13591	13610	13626	13626	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s how it is . We do n’t make the rules . We just work here . ”
13634	13659	13671	13673	the eldest maid	529	“ I ’m . . . um . . . just going to leave , I think . Have you guys seen Mr. Buchanan ? ”
13660	13670	13671	13673	the eldest maid	529	“ No one sees Mr. Buchanan except Mr. Eldon , ”
13677	13687	13705	13705	Gretchen	58	“ Do you want me to call Mr. Eldon ? ”
13688	13704	13756	13757	the women	171	“ No , that ’s okay . I already had my fill of Mr. Eldon . ”
13736	13747	13756	13757	the women	171	“ So tomorrow ’s Sunday . What happens on Sunday ? ”
13748	13753	13756	13757	the women	171	“ Boathouse and Greenhouse , ”
13760	13769	13756	13757	the women	171	“ And any outlying buildings or special projects . ”
13770	13774	13756	13757	the women	171	“ And Monday ? ”
13775	13809	13756	13757	the women	171	“ No one works on Monday or Tuesday . Wednesday is the north wing , Thursday is the east wing , Friday is the south wing , and Sunday is the west wing . ”
13810	13835	13756	13757	the women	171	“ You do a different area each day of the week ? Huh . Which day of the week is Mr. Buchanan ’s room ? ”
13836	13839	13841	13841	he	535	“ Wednesday . ”
13855	13863	13756	13757	the women	171	“ And the rest of the family ? ”
13864	13877	13756	13757	the women	171	“ No one else lives here except Mr. Eldon and Mr. Buchanan . ”
13907	13933	13949	13950	One woman	520	“ I see . Well , I think I ’m going to finish taking a look around , if that ’s okay with you guys . ”
13934	13948	13949	13950	One woman	520	“ Are you sure you do n’t want me to ring Mr. Eldon ? ”
13964	13971	13756	13757	the women	171	“ I ’m sure he ’d — ”
13972	13996	14004	14005	one maid	542	“ No , I ’m good . I was just heading down to the kitchens . Can you tell me where they are ? ”
13997	14003	14024	14024	Spiffy	86	“ There ’s three kitchens , ”
14008	14023	14024	14024	Spiffy	86	“ But the only one that ’s kept stocked is in the north wing . ”
14026	14036	13756	13757	the women	171	“ Thank you . Is there a kitchen staff ? ”
14037	14058	13756	13757	the women	171	“ Just Mr. Eldon . He prepares all of Mr. Buchanan ’s meals . He ’s probably there right now . ”
14059	14063	14122	14122	She	58	“ I see . ”
14088	14121	14894	14894	he	189	“ Well , skip that , then . I ’m not that hungry after all . I ’ll check the kitchens out some other time . Thanks for your help , ladies . ”
14885	14893	14916	14916	Gretchen	58	“ Get the fuck out of here , ”
14912	14915	14916	14916	Gretchen	58	“ Sorry , ”
14932	14943	14916	14916	Gretchen	58	“ I did n’t mean to spy . I just — ”
14944	14960	14916	14916	Gretchen	58	“ Get out of here ! Go ! You ’re not allowed down this hall ! ”
14961	14969	14974	14974	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m so sorry ! I — ”
14970	14973	15892	15892	she	56	“ GO ! ”
15886	15891	15892	15892	she	56	“ Do n’t move , ”
15896	15902	15931	15931	Eldon	84	“ I ’ll get it . ”
15937	15941	15947	15947	Audrey	56	“ Ms. Petty . ”
15942	15946	15947	15947	Audrey	56	“ Good afternoon , ”
15951	15959	16073	16073	Eldon	84	“ Can I help you with something ? ”
16047	16072	16127	16127	Eldon	84	“ I ’m here to show the other Ms. Petty the project she will be working on , if now is a good time . ”
16119	16126	16127	16127	Eldon	84	“ Is now a good time ? ”
16136	16141	16153	16153	Gretchen	58	“ A good time ? ”
16164	16181	16189	16189	Audrey	56	“ Now is perfect . Audrey , can you keep an eye on Igor for me ? ”
16182	16188	16189	16189	Audrey	56	“ He ’s a cat , ”
16208	16217	16232	16232	Gretchen	58	“ Exactly how much watching does he need ? ”
16218	16231	16283	16283	Gretchen	58	“ Just make sure he does n’t eat a tassel or something , ”
16275	16282	16283	16283	Gretchen	58	“ Lead on , my friend , ”
16287	16297	16309	16309	his	439	“ I ca n’t wait to see this project . ”
16324	16341	16355	16355	She	58	“ Mr. Buchanan wanted me to set proper expectations for you in regards to this project . ”
16342	16354	16387	16387	Eldon	84	“ Proper expectations ? I think I hear a lecture incoming . ”
16377	16386	16390	16390	his	84	“ This will be a quite lengthy project , ”
16394	16411	16390	16390	his	84	“ It should take you at least a month to catalog and go through the letters . ”
16412	16419	16390	16390	his	84	“ I ’m fine with that . ”
16420	16433	16443	16443	He	84	“ The letters are very old and should be handled with care . ”
16434	16442	16443	16443	He	84	“ Duh . I ’ll be careful . ”
16450	16491	16498	16498	Gretchen	58	“ Further , they are not to be removed from the premises . They are also not to be photocopied or scanned in . Mr. Buchanan is very concerned about the privacy of the project and the family ’s wishes . ”
16492	16497	16500	16500	him	84	“ Whatever you say , ”
16502	16524	16582	16582	his	84	“ I ’m just the hired help . You just point me at the letters and I ’ll get to work . ”
16525	16528	16541	16541	Gretchen	58	“ Indeed . ”
16551	16567	16579	16579	Eldon	84	“ So the letters are from the Buchanan family ’s archives ? Is that correct ? ”
16568	16578	16582	16582	his	84	“ I am not at liberty to discuss things , ”
16590	16603	16582	16582	his	84	“ Well , can I ask Mr. Buchanan about them ? I — ”
16604	16626	16582	16582	his	84	“ Mr. Buchanan is busy . He is not going to be involved . Do not disturb him with your questions . ”
16627	16640	16651	16651	He	84	“ And that ’s fine , but I just thought that since — ”
16641	16650	16651	16651	He	84	“ You are not to bother Mr. Buchanan ! ”
16659	16687	16704	16704	Gretchen	58	“ He is a very busy man and does not want to be disturbed . Your being on location does not mean he is at your disposal . ”
16713	16727	16698	16698	Buchanan	81	“ I was n’t suggesting that . I was just going to say — ”
16728	16757	16769	16769	Gretchen	58	“ If you are not interested in reviewing the project , Ms. Petty , I can let the publisher know that we are in need of another writer . ”
16758	16768	16769	16769	Gretchen	58	“ If you ’d let me finish a sentence , ”
16772	16794	16819	16819	Eldon	84	“ you would know that that is not what I ’m saying at all . Just show me the damn letters . ”
16811	16818	16837	16837	he	84	“ They are right this way , ”
16854	16859	17071	17072	The butler	439	“ Please follow me . ”
17078	17118	17124	17124	she	58	“ I do n’t think I need to remind you to keep these doors shut at all times . The library has many old and priceless books , and the hall here is quite sunny and could age them . ”
17119	17123	17376	17376	she	58	“ Of course , ”
17383	17393	17398	17398	Eldon	84	“ So this is where I ’ll be working ? ”
17394	17397	17398	17398	Eldon	84	“ Indeed . ”
17401	17418	17376	17376	she	58	“ I should like to remind you that nothing is to be removed from the library — ”
17419	17423	17376	17376	she	58	“ Of course . ”
17424	17449	17398	17398	Eldon	84	“ And please do not touch anything you do not feel you need for your project . Some of these items are quite valuable — ”
17450	17454	17376	17376	she	58	“ Of course . ”
17455	17463	17486	17486	He	84	“ And then I must remind you — ”
17464	17485	17518	17518	He	84	“ Not to open the doors and let the sunlight in because the books will turn to dust . Right . ”
17503	17517	17518	17518	He	84	“ Do you want to warn me not to feed Mogwai after midnight ? ”
17523	17530	17600	17600	Gretchen	58	“ Never mind . Eighties joke . ”
17605	17612	17621	17621	his	84	“ So where are the letters ? ”
17613	17618	17671	17671	Eldon	84	“ Right this way . ”
17688	17699	17704	17704	She	58	“ This desk has been designated for your work area . ”
17700	17703	17714	17714	she	58	“ Mmmhmm . ”
17730	17738	17739	17739	Gretchen	58	“ The letters are in this trunk . ”
17754	17766	17771	17771	Eldon	84	“ The container that holds the letters is in the trunk ? ”
17767	17770	17783	17783	He	84	“ No , ”
17774	17782	17877	17877	she	58	“ The letters are in the trunk . ”
17888	17892	17898	17898	Eldon	84	“ All these ? ”
17893	17897	17898	17898	Eldon	84	“ All these , ”
17901	17908	17915	17915	she	58	“ They are cataloged by year . ”
17909	17914	17958	17958	They	610	“ I see that , ”
17971	17982	17958	17958	They	610	“ Are there really thirty years of letters in here ? ”
17983	17988	18108	18108	Gretchen	58	“ So it seems . ”
18043	18049	18108	18108	Gretchen	58	“ When can I start ? ”
18050	18056	18076	18076	Audrey	56	“ You can start tomorrow . ”
18060	18075	18202	18202	she	58	“ You ’re fine with me going back to work and leaving you here ? ”
18154	18201	18342	18342	she	56	“ I ’m fine . I start the letters today , and if this weekend is any indication , Eldon ’s the only one I ’ll ever see . Mr. Buchanan is either avoiding us or not in residence , and either way suits me fine , ”
18350	18361	18362	18362	Audrey	56	“ I ’ve met Buchanan a few times , Gretchen . ”
18380	18408	18448	18448	Audrey	56	“ He ’s not what I ’d call friendly or pleasant . I just worry about you being here with only that man and that horrible butler . ”
18409	18447	18448	18448	Audrey	56	“ I ’ll be fine , Audrey . Me and Igor will just work on the book , live off sandwiches , and get this project done as soon as possible . It ’s no big deal . ”
18461	18491	18523	18523	Gretchen	58	“ You ’re sure ? It ’s not that far of a drive from the Hawkings building . I can get into a cab and come get you if — ”
18492	18522	18523	18523	Gretchen	58	“ If what ? I fall down the stairs and no one notices my crumpled form for weeks ? Come on , Audrey . You ’ve seen this place . ”
18535	18584	18597	18597	She	58	“ This house could fit all of my apartment building in here with room to spare , and there ’s only two guys living here . The odds of me running into him are slim to none . If I need anything , I just ring for Eldon . ”
18585	18596	18597	18597	She	58	“ I know . I still do n’t like this . ”
18617	18624	18523	18523	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s a weird setup . ”
18625	18657	18523	18523	Gretchen	58	“ Yeah , but if Buchanan was a creepster , there are lots of cheaper ways to get women . Hookers do n’t cost nearly what the publisher ’s paying me . ”
18658	18665	18597	18597	She	58	“ That is so not funny . ”
18666	18708	18523	18523	Gretchen	58	“ Oh , I do n’t know . It ’s kind of funny if you think about it . I ’m the literary equivalent of a hooker . Give me a contract and I ’ll do whatever you want , baby . ”
18709	18714	18597	18597	She	58	“ Still not funny . ”
18715	18725	18730	18730	Igor	79	“ Come on . Just a little bit funny . ”
18726	18729	18766	18766	she	58	“ Nope . ”
18776	18785	18809	18809	She	58	“ Tell Audrey it ’s funny , Igor . ”
18786	18808	18809	18809	She	58	“ Gretch , you ’ve really got to get out of the house more if you ’re talking to that cat . ”
18822	18837	18846	18846	Audrey	56	“ Tell Audrey that Mommy ’s out of the house right now , Igor . ”
18838	18845	18846	18846	Audrey	56	“ This is what I mean . ”
18849	18860	18875	18875	Gretchen	58	“ That cat gets more attention than your last boyfriend . ”
18861	18874	18875	18875	Gretchen	58	“ This cat is better to cuddle with than my last boyfriend , ”
18879	18890	18891	18891	Audrey	56	“ And you ’re going to be late to work . ”
18913	18921	18932	18932	She	58	“ You ’re going to be fine ? ”
18922	18931	18934	18934	her	58	“ Igor and I will be just fine . ”
18950	18972	18891	18891	Audrey	56	“ Call me if you need me . And keep your phone on you so I can check you via text . ”
18973	18987	19061	19061	she	58	“ I ’m twenty - six , Audrey . I can handle myself . ”
18988	19025	19043	19043	Gretchen	58	“ You ’re in your pajamas , talking to your cat . Forgive me if I feel a moment of doubt . It ’s like you ’re turning into the crazy cat lady before my eyes . ”
19026	19042	19061	19061	she	58	“ Am not . Igor and I are having a month - long slumber party , ”
19070	19080	19090	19090	She	58	“ Is n’t that right , Igor - Wigor ? ”
19081	19089	19090	19090	She	58	“ God , you and that cat . ”
19095	19111	19118	19118	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s no wonder you ’re eternally single . I ’m out of here . ”
19112	19117	19152	19152	her	56	“ Text ya later , ”
19163	19179	19191	19191	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m thinking she ’s not fond of you as a roomie , Igor . ”
19200	19254	20362	20362	he	81	“ Okay , so Audrey might be right about the whole me - still - in - pajamas - talking - to - a - cat - is - pathetic thing . And given that I ’m still talking to you , she might also have a point about the eternally single thing . ”
20380	20384	20362	20362	he	81	“ Hi there . ”
20395	20406	20444	20444	he	81	“ I thought I ’d come out and say hi . ”
20438	20443	20452	20452	she	58	“ Are you drunk ? ”
20448	20451	20495	20495	His	81	“ No , ”
20479	20494	20519	20519	He	81	“ I ’m friendly . I saw you out here and wanted to talk . ”
20523	20532	20569	20569	she	58	“ I have nothing to say to you . ”
20564	20568	20569	20569	she	58	“ Your penis ! ”
20573	20578	20612	20612	she	58	“ I saw it ! ”
20606	20611	20612	20612	she	58	“ It ’s true , ”
20620	20651	20659	20659	she	58	“ I was snooping and I saw you naked . All of you . Really naked . That ’s why you wo n’t talk to me , is n’t it ? ”
20662	20700	20723	20723	He	81	“ I mean , you can sit here and pretend you do n’t want to talk to me , but we both know it ’s totally awkward because I saw your dick before I saw your face . ”
20731	20757	20778	20778	She	58	“I , uh , did n’t mean it like that . Damn , I ’m much better at banter when it ’s on the page . ”
20770	20777	20832	20832	she	58	“ Can we try this again ? ”
20791	20830	20838	20838	He	81	“ Hi there ! I ’m Gretchen , and I ’m working on ghostwriting the project in your library . I ’m only going to be here for a month , but I hope we can be friends . ”
20857	20874	20895	20895	He	81	“ I trust you ’ll stay out of my way for the next month , then . ”
20888	20894	20924	20924	he	81	“ I guess I will . ”
20901	20914	20954	20954	you	71	“ See that you do . I ’m a very busy man . ”
20962	20970	20995	20995	herself	58	“ Your penis , I saw it ! ”
20981	20991	22310	22310	He	701	“ Seems to work for Astronaut Bill and Uranea , ”
22328	22336	22337	22337	Gretchen	58	“ Were we supposed to dress up ? ”
22349	22377	22384	22384	he	701	“ I admit that I thought of this as a work trip so I wore my usual writing clothes . Sorry if I ’m a bit underdressed . ”
22378	22383	22384	22384	he	701	“ It ’s fine , ”
22388	22393	22394	22394	She	58	“ You are sufficient . ”
22403	22416	22482	22482	she	58	“ Sufficient ? I bet you say that to all the girls . ”
22474	22481	22792	22792	he	701	“ Thank you for the rose , ”
22787	22791	22792	22792	he	701	“ Blue Girl , ”
22810	22813	22841	22841	he	701	“ What ? ”
22848	22861	22874	22874	he	701	“ The rose I sent you . It ’s called Blue Girl . ”
22899	22920	22944	22944	His	701	“ I see . It ’s a lovely rose . I thought it was more purple than blue , though . ”
22921	22943	22961	22961	She	58	“ It is . Very hard to get a true blue color from roses . Most soil is not acidic enough . ”
22957	22960	23253	23253	he	701	“ Ah . ”
23248	23252	23261	23261	she	58	“ My apologies , ”
23256	23260	23273	23273	he	701	“ No problem , ”
23279	23301	23332	23332	he	701	“ Sorry I did n’t dress up . I figured this was n’t a date , so you know . . . ”
23326	23331	23343	23343	he	701	“ Of course not , ”
23360	23376	23419	23420	Mr. Buchanan	81	“ I simply wore a jacket because it was pleasing to me to dress well . ”
23430	23436	23449	23449	she	58	“ Would you like some ? ”
23437	23448	23462	23462	she	58	“ Are you just trying to get me liquored up ? ”
23455	23461	23481	23481	he	701	“ That was a joke , ”
23483	23490	23648	23648	she	58	“ I ’d love a drink . ”
23642	23647	23648	23648	she	58	“ I ’m Gretchen , ”
23655	23668	23675	23675	he	701	“ I do n’t know that we ever had a formal introduction . ”
23669	23674	23675	23675	he	701	“ We did not , ”
23682	23697	23775	23775	Gretchen	58	“ I find it hard to introduce myself when I am naked and unawares . ”
23748	23774	23775	23775	Gretchen	58	“ Yes , I do imagine it ’s quite hard when a madwoman approaches you in the gardens shouting about how she saw your penis , ”
23779	23792	23836	23836	he	701	“ I can understand how that ’s not much of an icebreaker . ”
23849	23856	23865	23865	she	58	“ I ’m Hunter . Buchanan . ”
23857	23864	23865	23865	she	58	“ I figured it was Buchanan , ”
23868	23887	23888	23888	He	701	“ Unless you were related to Eldon and you had the real Buchanan locked away in the attic . ”
23901	23909	23921	23921	Gretchen	58	“ Eldon is my assistant and butler . ”
23910	23920	23983	23983	He	701	“ Clearly you hired him for his sparkling personality , ”
23947	23982	23983	23983	He	701	“ Sorry . I ’m not trying to be unpleasant . He just was n’t very . . . welcoming when I arrived . I ’m sure he ’s quite capable as an assistant . ”
24018	24034	24041	24041	she	58	“ Eldon is very protective of the estate . He is not fond of visitors . ”
24035	24040	24045	24045	He	701	“ I gathered that , ”
24052	24065	24072	24072	Gretchen	58	“ Was he cruel to you ? Should I speak to him ? ”
24066	24071	24080	24080	he	701	“ Oh , no . ”
24086	24108	24115	24115	Hunter	57	“ I was just surprised , that ’s all . So it ’s just you and him in this big house ? ”
24109	24114	24115	24115	Hunter	57	“ Not at all , ”
24138	24141	24166	24166	him	57	“ Oh ? ”
24142	24159	24216	24216	she	58	“ The cleaning crew is here most days . I assume Eldon told you the schedule ? ”
24210	24215	24245	24245	Hunter	57	“ This looks delicious , ”
24237	24244	24245	24245	Hunter	57	“ Eldon is an adequate cook , ”
24248	24265	24360	24360	He	57	“ Well if that is n’t a ringing endorsement , I do n’t know what is . ”
24366	24372	24398	24398	Hunter	57	“ Is everything all right ? ”
24391	24397	24551	24551	He	57	“ Great , thank you . ”
24562	24568	24579	24579	His	57	“ Something is bothering you . ”
24569	24578	24579	24579	His	57	“ No , really , I ’m fine . ”
24591	24613	24671	24671	she	58	“ It ’s not necessary for you to humor me with dinner . If you wish to go , please go . ”
24679	24693	24694	24694	He	57	“ Sorry about that . I do n’t think I can eat this . ”
24703	24710	24720	24720	she	58	“ Do you not like Italian ? ”
24711	24719	24720	24720	she	58	“ Do n’t you have a cook ? ”
24724	24740	24741	24741	He	57	“ I mean , you ’re rich . You can afford a cook , right ? ”
24755	24762	24771	24771	she	58	“ Eldon ’s cooking is sufficient . ”
24763	24770	24771	24771	she	58	“ I ca n’t eat it , ”
24775	24802	24809	24809	he	57	“ It ’s not you . Trust me . I just . . . I ’ll gag if I have to pretend to like another mouthful . ”
24803	24808	24815	24815	he	57	“ You already gagged , ”
24829	24847	24855	24855	She	58	“ Yeah , I did . Thank God this dinner party is only for two , right ? ”
24848	24854	24855	24855	She	58	“ Is the wine acceptable ? ”
24876	24890	24895	24895	He	57	“ It ’s very quiet here , too . I find that unnerving . ”
24891	24894	24897	24897	his	57	“ Quiet ? ”
24911	24919	24927	24927	she	58	“ Do you not like the quiet ? ”
24920	24926	24927	24927	she	58	“ I live in SoHo , ”
24941	24994	25005	25005	he	57	“ There are cars on the street at all hours , and noisy neighbors , and people going up and down the stairs of my walkup . It ’s never quiet . You never feel isolated and alone like you do here . I guess I ’m just not used to it . ”
24995	24999	25005	25005	he	57	“ I see . ”
25010	25030	25037	25037	He	57	“ Your house is gorgeous , though . Please do n’t take it as a slight against this place . ”
25031	25036	25055	25055	he	57	“ I do n’t . ”
25066	25079	25005	25005	he	57	“ Well , I appreciate you letting me stay here , regardless . ”
25080	25089	25037	25037	He	57	“ But you do not like it here . ”
25090	25105	25005	25005	he	57	“ How can anyone not like it here ? It ’s like a castle . ”
25106	25117	25147	25147	She	58	“ Castles are not pleasant for those in the dungeons . ”
25118	25146	25147	25147	She	58	“ Well , if my room is a dungeon , it ’s the most enjoyable dungeon I ’ve ever stayed in . Seriously , it ’s fine . ”
25155	25172	25182	25182	he	725	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m insulting the grandest house I ’ve ever stayed in . ”
25173	25181	25182	25182	he	725	“ Perhaps it is not the house , ”
25186	25193	25194	25194	Gretchen	58	“ But the lack of company ? ”
25200	25208	25182	25182	he	725	“ That ’s probably it , yes . ”
25209	25215	25228	25228	she	58	“ What about your cat ? ”
25216	25227	25231	25231	He	725	“ Well , Igor ’s not much of a conversationalist , ”
25248	25258	25301	25301	he	725	“ I meant you could keep him with you . ”
25259	25286	25301	25301	he	725	“ Oh . That ’s very nice of you . I worry he might get lost , though . My room ’s larger than my apartment . ”
25287	25300	25301	25301	he	725	“ If he gets lost , I will help you find him , ”
25327	25333	25341	25341	He	725	“ You ’re very kind . ”
25334	25340	25341	25341	He	725	“ Would you . . . ”
25345	25357	25386	25386	She	58	“ Would you like to meet again for dinner tomorrow night ? ”
25396	25406	25424	25424	She	58	“ You do n’t sound excited by the prospect . ”
25407	25423	25424	25424	She	58	“ It is you who should not be excited . Eldon will be cooking again . ”
25427	25434	25444	25444	he	725	“ Can he make a sandwich ? ”
25450	25460	25386	25386	She	58	“ He can make a mean sandwich , yes . ”
25461	25467	25474	25474	Gretchen	58	“ Then dinner sounds terrific . ”
25489	25511	26029	26029	she	58	“ Seriously , Igor , I do n’t see how a project like this could be so mind - numbingly dull . ”
26017	26028	26029	26029	she	58	“ We ’ll just have to buckle down , Igor , ”
26046	26065	26108	26108	she	58	“ I ’ll come back after dinner and then we ’ll pick up round two . Sound good ? ”
26097	26107	26650	26650	he	57	“ I do n’t know how Hunter does it , ”
26645	26649	26668	26668	she	58	“ Good evening , ”
26660	26667	26668	26668	she	58	“ Hi to you , too , ”
26687	26693	26703	26703	she	58	“ Have a good day ? ”
26694	26698	26703	26703	she	58	“ It was — ”
26699	26702	26786	26786	he	57	“ Sufficient ? ”
26782	26785	26786	26786	he	57	“ Indeed , ”
26799	26806	26813	26813	she	58	“ How are the letters coming ? ”
26807	26812	26861	26861	He	57	“ They ’re coming , ”
26849	26860	26921	26921	He	57	“ Nice weather we ’re having , is n’t it ? ”
26879	26920	26921	26921	He	57	“ Before I leave this place , Hunter Buchanan , I ’m going to get you to admit that you ’re having a good day and that the weather is nice . Not everything has to be shades of gray . ”
26934	26943	26955	26955	She	58	“ I see you received your rose today . ”
26944	26954	26955	26955	She	58	“ I did . What ’s this one called ? ”
26966	26970	26921	26921	He	57	“ Gypsy Carnival . ”
26971	26976	26982	26982	He	57	“ I love it . ”
26977	26981	26992	26992	Gretchen	58	“ Do you ? ”
26995	27019	27028	27028	He	57	“ Well , it ’s not quite my favorite so far . I liked the first one the best . The blue one . ”
27020	27027	27028	27028	He	57	“ Blue Girl . I remember . ”
27037	27055	27192	27192	he	57	“ I liked it best , though they ’re all incredibly lovely . Your taste is impeccable . ”
27203	27208	27215	27215	She	58	“ You hurt yourself . ”
27209	27214	27257	27257	he	57	“ It ’s nothing . ”
27264	27270	27361	27361	His	57	“ You should be careful . ”
27372	27380	27386	27386	His	57	“ May I ask you something personal ? ”
27381	27385	27386	27386	His	57	“ I suppose . ”
27394	27404	27414	27414	she	58	“ How did your . . . injuries happen ? ”
27420	27432	27496	27496	he	57	“ I ’m sorry I asked . I just . . . ”
27509	27527	27607	27607	his	753	“ You want to know about my scars ? Why I ’m as ugly as I am ? ”
27528	27534	27600	27600	His	753	“ I did n’t mean — ”
27535	27599	27607	27607	his	753	“ My secret is not a secret . Ask anyone and they ’ll tell you . You can find it in all the newspapers , too . When I was ten , I was kidnapped from boarding school and held for ransom . The fools thought that because my father was incredibly wealthy , that he ’d pay anything for his only heir . ”
27611	27695	27780	27780	He	755	“ They did not know my father well . My father did n’t give two shits about me . He did n’t care about leaving a legacy . He just wanted to see how much money he could acquire before he died . I was simply an inconvenience . When he ’d heard I ’d been kidnapped , the first thing he wanted to know was how much they wanted . And when he heard the price , he refused to pay it . ”
27702	27779	27780	27780	He	755	“ They kept me on a boat for a week . As the days passed , I knew my father was n’t sending anyone for me , so I planned my escape . I thought it ’d be easy to jump overboard and swim to shore . So I did , except when I went over the side , I hit the propeller . It destroyed my face and my arm and tore up my chest . ”
27786	27805	27809	27809	Her	756	“ I almost lost all these fingers , but instead I only lost one . I nearly died . ”
27813	27839	27843	27843	his	755	“ I suppose I should be considered lucky . The propeller was moving at a very low speed and it only destroyed half of me . ”
27849	27889	27906	27906	he	755	“ The kidnappers panicked as soon as they saw the blood in the water and tried to get away . A nearby fisherman saw me go overboard and swam out to save me . He is why I lived . ”
27894	27904	28390	28390	Hunter	57	“ Now you know . Never ask me again . ”
28401	28411	28390	28390	Hunter	57	“ Send the cleaning crew in this wing tomorrow . ”
28412	28416	28424	28424	Hunter	57	“ Of course . ”
28417	28423	28484	28484	Eldon	84	“ That ’ll be all . ”
28473	28483	28610	28610	he	57	“ Shall I send her away , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
28606	28609	28610	28610	he	57	“ No , ”
28614	28618	28610	28610	he	57	“ She stays . ”
28619	28623	28631	28631	He	57	“ I see . ”
28624	28630	29093	29093	My	0	“ Thank you , Eldon . ”
29082	29092	29790	29790	Eldon	84	“ Lulabelle , you little Victorian sexpot , you . ”
29783	29789	29805	29805	She	58	“ You ’re here early , ”
29812	29839	29849	29849	he	84	“ Thought I ’d get a head start on things . Do n’t bother making me breakfast , by the way . I made my own . ”
29840	29848	29849	29849	he	84	“ I did not make you breakfast , ”
29864	29870	29976	29976	Gretchen	58	“ Yeah , I guessed . ”
29972	29975	29984	29984	She	58	“ Wait , ”
30008	30017	30080	30080	she	58	“ Can you please give this to Hunter ? ”
30065	30079	30093	30093	Eldon	84	“ It ’s very important that he gets it as soon as possible , ”
30103	30145	30160	30160	he	439	“ Dear Hunter , I would very much appreciate it if you would join me for dinner tonight in the kitchen . Nothing fancy , but I promise you I ’m a much better cook than Eldon . Sincerely , Gretchen . ”
30165	30175	30188	30188	Gretchen	58	“ I do n’t see anything urgent in this . ”
30176	30187	30188	30188	Gretchen	58	“ Yeah , well , it was n’t for you , ”
30198	30206	30160	30160	he	439	“ Just deliver it , all right ? ”
30207	30215	30220	30220	Gretchen	58	“ Shall I bring back a response ? ”
30216	30219	30220	30220	Gretchen	58	“ Nah , ”
30224	30236	30242	30242	He	439	“ I ’ll know tonight if he shows up or not . ”
30237	30241	30770	30770	Eldon	84	“ Very well . ”
30758	30765	30784	30784	she	58	“ She left you this note , ”
30825	30836	30842	30842	Eldon	84	“ Thank you , Eldon . That ’ll be all . ”
30837	30841	30842	30842	Eldon	84	“ Very well , ”
30850	30872	30784	30784	she	58	“ I shall return to my duties , unless you ’d like for me to carry your response back to her ? ”
30873	30886	31355	31355	Hunter	57	“ No thank you . I ’m going to think on it . ”
31349	31352	31359	31359	She	58	“ Enter , ”
31373	31376	31397	31397	he	57	“ Surprise . ”
31411	31418	31438	31438	his	57	“ What are you doing here ? ”
31419	31432	31446	31446	She	58	“ Nice to see you , too . Can I come in ? ”
31441	31445	31481	31481	she	58	“ Of course . ”
31490	31496	31501	31501	She	58	“ Gypsy Carnival , right ? ”
31497	31500	31501	31501	She	58	“ Correct . ”
31508	31526	31557	31557	He	57	“ I thought you were ordering flowers to send to me . You grow all of them ? ”
31544	31556	31557	31557	He	57	“ Gardening is my hobby . I enjoy roses the most . ”
31567	31579	31599	31599	she	58	“ This is where I come to get away from things . ”
31593	31598	31647	31647	She	58	“ It ’s marvelous , ”
31624	31646	31647	31647	She	58	“ You ’re really good at this — the roses look better than anything I ’ve ever gotten from a florist . ”
31665	31673	31706	31706	his	57	“ Do you do anything with them ? ”
31674	31677	31698	31698	He	57	“ Do ? ”
31678	31697	31706	31706	his	57	“ Yes . Do you sell them to a local florist or something ? You have so many . ”
31715	31752	31753	31753	She	58	“ I . . . sometimes I have Eldon show them . And sometimes I cross them , to try and see if I can create a new variety . But I mostly like growing them . ”
31763	31780	31806	31806	he	57	“ I would have never pictured a big , strong guy like you as a gardener . ”
31800	31805	31806	31806	he	57	“ I enjoy plants , ”
31810	31820	31828	31828	she	58	“ They are far easier to understand than people . ”
31821	31827	31828	31828	she	58	“ Most people are assholes , ”
31832	31845	31858	31858	he	57	“ I think that ’s why I prefer writing . Or baking . ”
31869	31884	31891	31891	She	58	“ Did you come out here to discuss the merits of books versus roses ? ”
31885	31890	31891	31891	She	58	“ Actually , no . ”
31899	31919	31926	31926	His	57	“ I wanted to come out here and ask you if you were going to come to dinner tonight . ”
31920	31925	31926	31926	His	57	“ I . . . ”
31936	31939	31947	31947	she	58	“ Perhaps . ”
31940	31946	31947	31947	she	58	“ Oh , come on , ”
31951	31967	32012	32012	She	58	“ I can tell you all about my day . It ’s been most interesting . ”
32028	32053	32094	32094	her	58	“ You know all those letters I ’ve been transcribing ? It seems that my two historical figures had a rather torrid love affair . ”
32098	32132	32217	32217	she	58	“ What ’s even better is that they describe , in rather blatant , sexual detail , what they want to do to each other . Is n’t that . . . interesting ? ”
32210	32216	32217	32217	she	58	“ What do you think ? ”
32220	32225	32230	32230	He	57	“ I . . . ”
32226	32229	32254	32254	he	57	“ Yes ? ”
32273	32282	32289	32289	She	58	“ I ’d like for you to leave . ”
32300	32309	32294	32294	her	58	“ So I take it dinner ’s off ? ”
32310	32323	32338	32338	she	58	“ I . . . no . I will think about it . ”
32333	32337	32360	32360	She	58	“ Suit yourself , ”
32342	32359	32602	32602	Audrey	56	“ I ’m off to go read more letters . I hope to see you tonight . ”
32593	32601	32602	32602	Audrey	56	“ It sounds like he likes you , ”
32609	32618	32625	32625	Gretchen	58	“ But it sounds like he ’s shy . ”
32619	32624	32648	32648	she	58	“ You think so ? ”
32653	32678	32602	32602	Audrey	56	“ He ’s just so hard to predict . I ca n’t forget how he freaked out when I asked him about his face . ”
32679	32722	32731	32731	Gretchen	58	“ Maybe he ’s just a loner . I mean , he ’s friends with Logan and his buddies , but out of all of them , he ’s the most remote . Does n’t attend any parties they give or anything . ”
32723	32730	32731	32731	Gretchen	58	“ He ’s definitely a loner , ”
32734	32764	32800	32800	She	58	“ But there ’s something so incredibly . . . remote about him . Most loners seem happy to be by themselves . He just seems a bit lost . ”
32765	32799	32826	32826	She	58	“ Yeah , Logan says that he ’s not the friendliest guy , but he ’s very true once he lets someone in . He ’s always very polite to me , though . ”
32814	32825	32845	32846	the staff	845	“ I did n’t think he ever left this house . ”
32855	32857	32897	32897	him	57	“ bother ”
32906	32926	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Of course he leaves his house , Gretch . He has a billion - dollar real estate empire . ”
32927	32951	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Yeah , but does he have to do anything for that other than just , I do n’t know , own property ? ”
32955	32968	32991	32991	She	56	“ You really have no idea how billionaires work , do you ? ”
32969	32990	32991	32991	She	56	“ I do n’t want to know , honestly . All that money just seems like a lot of hassle . ”
33018	33037	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ So did Logan tell you about his past ? The thing with the scars and the kidnapping ? ”
33038	33054	33065	33065	She	56	“ Nope . No one talks about it , apparently . No one except you . ”
33055	33064	33082	33082	Igor	79	“ Yeah , me and my big mouth . ”
33089	33103	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ I guess I should n’t have asked . But I was curious . ”
33104	33140	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Well , leave your curiosity at the door . From what I can remember from meeting him , he does n’t like it if people so much as look at him the wrong way . ”
33141	33156	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Jeez , Audrey , exactly how many times have you met this guy ? ”
33157	33176	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ A handful of times . Like I said , he ’s one of Logan ’s closest friends . ”
33177	33194	33214	33214	She	847	“ And you never thought to give your sister the cliff notes rundown on the man ? ”
33195	33213	33214	33214	She	847	“ Well gee , Gretchen , I did n’t think you ’d want to bang the guy . ”
33218	33230	33235	33235	Audrey	56	“ Is it weird that I ’m finding the scars sexy ? ”
33231	33234	33235	33235	Audrey	56	“ Yes , ”
33239	33252	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ They ’re not cute scars , Gretch . They ’re disfiguring . ”
33253	33281	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Yeah , but they have a story . He has a story . I like that about him . I just ca n’t figure him out . ”
33282	33293	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Have you considered that he might be a virgin ? ”
33294	33303	33313	33313	Audrey	56	“ What ? He ’s not a virgin . ”
33304	33312	33313	33313	Audrey	56	“ Why does that seem so crazy ? ”
33316	33343	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ You said he blushes , right ? And does n’t look you in the eye ? And that he was scarred at an early age ? ”
33344	33349	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ Yes , but — ”
33350	33368	33313	33313	Audrey	56	“ You think he ’s going to get a lot of ladies with a playbook like that ? ”
33369	33406	32952	32952	Audrey	56	“ But he has to be close to thirty , if not already thirty . I ca n’t believe he ’d still be a virgin . Ca n’t you hire hookers for that sort of thing ? ”
33407	33417	33313	33313	Audrey	56	“ Gross , Gretchen . That ’s just gross . ”
33418	33429	33567	33567	he	57	“ I know , but we were both thinking it . ”
33585	33595	33603	33604	her sister	348	“ You might be on to something , Audrey . ”
33596	33602	33603	33604	her sister	348	“ Of course I am , ”
33608	33622	33567	33567	he	57	“ The question is , what are you going to do about it ? ”
33623	33635	33567	33567	he	57	“ You mean , hold him down and take his virginity ? ”
33636	33652	33603	33604	her sister	348	“ No ! Yuck ! Gretchen , that ’s a visual I did not want . ”
33653	33673	33567	33567	he	57	“ You brought it up . What do you mean , what am I going to do about it ? ”
33674	33709	33567	33567	he	57	“ I mean that the man ’s skittish as hell . If he ’s a virgin , you ’re going to have a hell of a time getting him to come on to you . ”
33710	33719	33774	33774	Gretchen	58	“ So I ’ll come on to him . ”
33720	33773	33567	33567	he	57	“ But you said he retreats every time you try to get intimate . Perhaps he does n’t want you to come on to him . Maybe he wants to be the aggressor and you ’re not giving him a chance ? Is there a way you can level the playing field ? ”
33812	33818	33852	33852	Audrey	56	“ I ’m not sure . ”
33819	33851	33852	33852	Audrey	56	“ He might be off balance and afraid to make a move if he thinks you ’re sexually experienced and he ’s not . Can you pretend to be a virgin ? ”
33859	33872	33567	33567	he	57	“ Har de har . I just need to think about it . ”
33873	33881	33852	33852	Audrey	56	“ About pretending to be a virgin ? ”
33882	33891	33917	33917	Gretchen	58	“ No . About leveling the playing field . ”
33908	33916	33962	33962	Audrey	56	“ Good luck , whatever you do . ”
33983	33988	34057	34057	Gretchen	58	“ level the playing field ”
34076	34081	34057	34057	Gretchen	58	“ Who is it ? ”
34082	34093	34127	34127	He	57	“ I . . . me . Hunter . Buchanan . ”
34122	34126	34209	34209	Hunter	57	“ Hi there . ”
34197	34202	34209	34209	Hunter	57	“ Is everything okay ? ”
34203	34208	34212	34212	He	57	“ Everything ’s fine , ”
34226	34230	34266	34266	she	58	“ Leave us . ”
34260	34265	34266	34266	she	58	“ Who ’s that ? ”
34269	34273	34255	34255	she	58	“ My bodyguard . ”
34274	34285	34292	34292	his	57	“ I see . So you ’re ditching me tonight ? ”
34296	34310	34352	34352	him	57	“ That ’s not what I . . . that is , I — ”
34311	34345	34372	34372	His	57	“ I guessed it as soon as I saw the suit . Though I admit , you do clean up nice . I ’m a little sad the suit is n’t for me . ”
34387	34420	34426	34426	Gretchen	58	“ I came to give you my apologies . I ca n’t make it to dinner tonight . A business meeting was scheduled and I find that I can not move it . ”
34421	34425	34426	34426	Gretchen	58	“ No worries . ”
34436	34445	34446	34446	He	57	“ Thanks for letting me know , though . ”
34466	34484	34523	34523	He	57	“ I would , however , like if we were to meet for dinner tomorrow night instead . ”
34485	34490	34495	34495	His	57	“ Tomorrow ’s fine . ”
34491	34494	34495	34495	His	57	“ Good . ”
34500	34511	34516	34516	she	58	“ Very good . Good . That ’s . . . ”
34512	34515	34590	34590	She	58	“ Good ? ”
34585	34589	34610	34610	she	58	“ May I ? ”
34604	34609	34665	34665	she	58	“ It ’s crooked , ”
34681	34685	34714	34714	her	58	“ All better . ”
34720	34723	34728	34728	He	57	“ Hunter ? ”
34724	34727	34772	34772	she	58	“ Hmm ? ”
34765	34771	34772	34772	she	58	“ Now we ’re even , ”
34777	34788	35327	35327	Gretchen	58	“ The field is leveled . Enjoy your meeting tonight . ”
35340	35346	35370	35370	Cooper	62	“ I should take this . ”
35374	35377	35386	35386	She	58	“ Hello ? ”
35378	35385	35392	35392	Hunter	57	“ Gretch ? It ’s me . ”
35418	35426	35392	35392	Hunter	57	“ Hey Coop . What ’s up ? ”
35427	35445	35454	35454	she	58	“ I was calling to , well , check on you . See how you ’re doing . ”
35446	35453	35454	35454	she	58	“ Oh , I ’m fine , ”
35458	35473	35492	35492	Cooper	62	“ The project ’s coming along really well . I might even finish early . ”
35485	35491	35492	35492	Cooper	62	“ That ’s great news , ”
35496	35504	35515	35515	She	58	“ I ’ve really missed seeing you . ”
35505	35514	35541	35541	she	58	“ I ’ve missed seeing you , too . ”
35531	35540	35541	35541	she	58	“ It ’s weird being away from everyone , ”
35555	35578	35584	35584	Gretchen	58	“ When you come back , I . . . I think I ’d like for us to have a nice talk . ”
35587	35613	35619	35619	Hunter	57	“ Oh , Coop . I just . . . I do n’t know . Ca n’t we just let things go as they do ? ”
35629	35645	35674	35674	His	57	“ Can I call you back some other time ? Now ’s really not great . ”
35646	35673	35694	35694	she	58	“ Oh , of course . I just . . . you know . Wanted to tell you that I missed you . That ’s all . ”
35683	35693	35706	35706	she	58	“ I ’ll see you when I get back , ”
35714	35719	35724	35724	he	57	“ Sorry about that . ”
35720	35723	35761	35761	She	58	“ Boyfriend ? ”
35769	35778	35794	35794	he	57	“ A male friend . He misses me . ”
35779	35793	35798	35798	He	57	“ Then perhaps it ’s a good thing that you ’re finishing early , ”
35808	35820	35827	35827	Hunter	57	“ I wo n’t keep you from your work any longer . ”
35821	35826	36400	36400	she	58	“ Oh , but — ”
36396	36399	36400	36400	she	58	“ No , ”
36403	36407	36459	36459	Her	58	“ Do n’t . ”
36473	36479	36498	36498	she	58	“ Is this for me ? ”
36491	36497	36498	36498	she	58	“ I think it is , ”
36502	36508	36657	36657	she	58	“ May I touch you ? ”
36646	36656	36657	36657	she	58	“ I want to get a look at you , ”
36665	36699	36735	36735	Gretchen	58	“ It makes me wet just thinking about this . I remember seeing you , naked and gleaming from the shower , though you were n’t as big then as you are today . ”
36740	36788	36821	36821	she	58	“ You ’re very big . I like that . I imagine when I take you in my throat , it ’s going to be hard to take you deep , is n’t it ? I ’m going to have to work to fit all of you . ”
36809	36819	36857	36857	Gretchen	58	“ You ’ll have to be patient with me . ”
36863	36878	36893	36893	His	57	“ Do you want me to stop ? Or can I keep exploring you ? ”
36879	36892	36910	36910	she	58	“ I . . . no . Keep . . . going . ”
36906	36909	37018	37018	her	58	“ Good , ”
37030	37047	37054	37054	His	57	“ I love touching you . Tastes so good . Do you want to touch me ? ”
37048	37053	37065	37065	she	58	“ I . . . ”
37059	37064	37065	37065	she	58	“ It ’s okay , ”
37073	37083	37171	37171	her	58	“ Maybe this time I ’ll just touch you . ”
37174	37193	37452	37452	He	57	“ I like it when you touch me . Show me what you want . Please , Hunter . ”
37464	37475	37513	37513	she	58	“ I . . . no . Gretchen . . . ”
37530	37533	37657	37657	he	57	“ Ah ! ”
37650	37656	37685	37685	She	58	“ I . . . , ”
37692	37704	37711	37711	he	57	“ Do n’t overthink it , Hunter . Just enjoy it . ”
37705	37708	37733	37733	her	58	“ Gretchen . ”
37751	37756	38858	38858	Gretchen	58	“ Goodnight , Hunter . ”
38852	38857	38924	38924	She	58	“ Oh ! Hey , ”
38873	38923	38924	38924	She	58	“ Sorry about this . I thought the roast would be ready in a half hour , but it ’s still looking a little pinker than I ’d like , so we need to give it a bit more time . That ’s why I ’m still in here . ”
38937	38954	38924	38924	She	58	“ Hope you do n’t mind filling up on bread and appetizers until it ’s done . ”
38973	38979	38984	38984	He	57	“ Is that for me ? ”
38980	38983	39007	39007	he	57	“ What ? ”
39003	39006	39030	39030	she	58	“ Yes , ”
39020	39029	39053	39053	her	58	“ The bud ’s tight on this one , ”
39072	39076	39081	39081	he	57	“ Smells wonderful . ”
39077	39080	39104	39104	she	58	“ Yes , ”
39118	39121	39145	39145	She	58	“ Soft . ”
39154	39159	39147	39147	her	58	“ Ready for dinner ? ”
39160	39165	39212	39212	he	57	“ I . . . ”
39198	39205	39499	39499	his	57	“ No . I must go . ”
39513	39517	39542	39542	she	58	“ I want this ”
39530	39541	39716	39716	He	84	“ Good God , these two are horny little buggers , ”
39723	39731	39732	39732	Gretchen	58	“ What may I help you with ? ”
39740	39749	39762	39762	he	84	“ Can you please give this to Hunter ? ”
39769	39776	39791	39791	Eldon	84	“ More commentary about my cooking ? ”
39777	39790	39791	39791	Eldon	84	“ Nope . I ’m inviting Hunter in for some research help . ”
39796	39824	39844	39844	he	84	“ I am sure Mr. Buchanan would prefer not to be disturbed with such requests . If you need assistance , you are to go to me . ”
39854	39883	39889	39889	Man	1795	“ No , I ’m pretty sure he ’d prefer to help me with this on his own . Anyhow , can you just give him the note ? ”
39884	39888	40074	40074	his	57	“ Very well . ”
40090	40096	40108	40108	He	57	“ Is there a problem ? ”
40097	40107	40114	40114	his	57	“ Yes . You wo n’t look at me . ”
40120	40123	40130	40130	she	58	“ I — ”
40124	40129	40130	40130	she	58	“ It ’s okay , ”
40149	40181	40228	40228	She	58	“ I was n’t trying to make you uncomfortable . I just know that you always look away when you ’re uneasy . You ’ve been avoiding me since the greenhouse . ”
40196	40227	40244	40244	he	57	“ Look , Hunter , I apologize if my actions made you uncomfortable . I want us to be friends . We can still be friends , ca n’t we ? ”
40240	40243	40244	40244	he	57	“ Friends , ”
40252	40256	40283	40283	He	57	“ Of course . ”
40257	40282	40303	40303	She	58	“ Great . I thought I ’d ask you , friend to friend , if you could help me with my project a little . ”
40298	40302	40345	40345	Hunter	57	“ Of course . ”
40316	40344	40361	40361	She	58	“ Perfect . I ’m trying to transcribe this in a way that ’ll be interesting to readers , and I ’m having trouble with the dynamics . ”
40357	40360	40363	40363	her	58	“ Dynamics ? ”
40386	40391	40464	40464	she	58	“ Shall we sit ? ”
40469	40506	40512	40512	His	57	“ I think if we ’re able to act out some of the things that are described , it ’ll be easier for me to write them . I ’m a visual learner , after all . ”
40507	40511	40600	40600	She	58	“ I see . ”
40592	40599	40659	40659	she	58	“ Shall we start , then ? ”
40672	40688	40694	40694	Hunter	57	“ Why do n’t I read the first one ? You can read the next . ”
40689	40693	40712	40712	her	58	“ Very well , ”
40728	40759	40772	40772	Gretchen	58	“ There is a man and a woman mentioned in this letter . I ’ll be Lula , and I ’d appreciate it if you can be Ben for me . ”
40766	40771	40772	40772	Gretchen	58	“ My dearest Ben , ”
40779	40829	40846	40846	she	58	“ It has been thirty days since we last saw each other . How languidly time passes when I am not in your arms . How achingly slow the sun moves through the skies , and the days cycle into evening . The nights are the hardest for me . ”
40849	40898	40960	40960	she	58	“ It seems the darkest hours are our time , my love . Last night I had a dream of our most recent party together . I remember that you found me in the dark . You put your hand on mine and guided it to your lips . ”
40964	41015	41118	41118	he	57	“ Then , it was like you changed your mind on what you wished to do to me . You took my hand and raised it over my head , pinning it there . I remembered that you held me down on the sofa and your weight settled over me . ”
41105	41117	41122	41122	His	57	“ Was this a plan to get me to touch you ? ”
41134	41139	41140	41140	She	58	“ Who , me ? ”
41147	41162	41167	41167	She	58	“ I just wanted you to help me act through some of the letters . ”
41163	41166	41208	41208	His	57	“ Mmmhmmm . ”
41195	41207	41256	41256	he	57	“ I might have had a slight ulterior motive . Slight . ”
41250	41255	41266	41266	she	58	“ What comes next ? ”
41260	41265	41271	41271	his	57	“ Let me see , ”
41280	41346	41347	41347	Gretchen	58	“ My pantaloons are damp with arousal just thinking of your touch . I think of your lips grazing over my skin . How you ’d rip my clothing away and bury your face into my feminine petals , determined to make me cry out with delight . You would taste me and please me even as your hands reached up to caress my breasts . ”
41355	41361	41511	41511	He	57	“ Whew . Sounds wild . ”
41520	41528	41511	41511	He	57	“ What did the letter say again ? ”
41529	41532	41596	41596	She	58	“ Um . ”
41605	41616	41623	41623	He	57	“ I think of your lips grazing over my skin . ”
41617	41622	41710	41710	He	57	“ Lips on skin ? ”
41699	41709	41710	41710	He	57	“ That feels so good , Hunter . More . ”
41728	41735	41744	41744	Gretchen	58	“ Does he lick her here ? ”
41736	41743	41781	41781	He	57	“ I ’m sure he does , ”
41791	41802	41810	41810	she	58	“ Tell me what to do — what pleases you . ”
41803	41809	41848	41848	his	57	“ Just keep doing that , ”
41854	41865	41872	41872	he	57	“ God , Hunter , you feel incredible against me . ”
41866	41871	41884	41884	he	57	“ Rip your clothing , ”
41890	41899	41935	41935	He	57	“ Bury my face into your feminine petals . ”
41927	41934	42029	42029	Hunter	57	“ Yes . Hunter , yes . ”
42023	42028	42052	42052	he	57	“ Ah , fuck , ”
42056	42062	42067	42067	his	57	“ You taste so good . ”
42074	42081	42099	42099	he	57	“ Yes . Keep touching me . ”
42093	42098	42113	42113	she	58	“ Tell me how , ”
42108	42112	42123	42123	He	57	“ My clit , ”
42116	42122	42140	42140	she	58	“ Put your tongue there . ”
42155	42158	42228	42228	he	57	“ More . ”
42214	42223	42263	42263	her	58	“ Oooh , you ’re good at that . ”
42276	42281	42290	42290	His	57	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
42315	42323	42330	42330	She	58	“ I . . . ca n’t . ”
42324	42329	42330	42330	She	58	“ You ca n’t ? ”
42337	42349	42350	42350	He	57	“ Please , Hunter . You were so good at that . ”
42361	42377	42405	42405	his	57	“ It ’s not you . It ’s just . . . I . . . ”
42416	42430	42431	42431	Hunter	57	“ You wo n’t touch me ? Do n’t you like touching me ? ”
42446	42451	42462	42462	she	58	“ Love touching you . ”
42452	42461	42462	42462	she	58	“ Did you feel how wet I was ? ”
42466	42480	42492	42492	Her	58	“ I need to come so badly . Wo n’t you touch me ? ”
42503	42525	42604	42604	she	58	“ If you wo n’t finish me , I guess I ’ll have to do it myself , wo n’t I ? ”
42597	42603	42728	42728	She	58	“ Touch yourself for me , ”
42716	42727	42831	42831	Hunter	57	“ Touch yourself , Hunter . I ’m so close . ”
42825	42830	42834	42834	his	57	“ Do n’t stop , ”
42838	42847	42854	42854	she	58	“ Need . . . to see it . ”
42848	42853	42894	42894	she	58	“ I wo n’t , ”
42883	42893	42894	42894	she	58	“ I wish it was your mouth on me , ”
42898	42905	43711	43711	She	58	“ Your cock deep inside me . ”
43700	43710	43981	43981	he	57	“ Mmm , Hunter ? What ’s going on ? ”
43977	43980	44022	44022	Her	58	“ Gretchen , ”
44013	44021	44022	44022	Her	58	“ I — we need to talk . ”
44031	44038	44041	44041	her	58	“ Talk ? That sounds bad . ”
44053	44064	44069	44069	He	57	“ Are you coming here to break up with me ? ”
44065	44068	44097	44097	her	58	“ No . ”
44101	44118	44143	44143	She	58	“ I just . . . there are things that need to be said between us . ”
44119	44142	44333	44333	she	58	“ That sounds very serious . Why do n’t you come to bed and tell me ? It ’s cold out here . ”
44329	44332	44333	44333	she	58	“ Better ? ”
44337	44342	44378	44378	he	57	“ You seem uneasy . ”
44368	44377	44378	44378	he	57	“ The lights off is better for you , ”
44382	44387	44412	44412	Gretchen	58	“ Less to see . ”
44426	44434	44443	44443	he	57	“ I like the way you look . ”
44435	44442	44465	44465	he	57	“ Do n’t lie to me , ”
44474	44482	44490	44490	she	58	“ I know what I look like . ”
44483	44489	44490	44490	she	58	“ I do , too , ”
44510	44560	44590	44590	he	57	“ You have dark hair and a strong nose , and scars on one side of your face . You ’re taller than me , have big arms , and you turn your cheek aside when possible , like you ’re trying to shield the world from your face . ”
44607	44625	44632	44632	she	58	“ People flinch when they look at me . They turn away when they see my face . ”
44626	44631	44632	44632	she	58	“ People are assholes , ”
44650	44666	44768	44768	she	58	“ You ’re a gorgeous , intelligent man . . . with a few scars . ”
44760	44767	44768	44768	she	58	“ Wo n’t you touch me ? ”
44774	44782	44815	44815	her	58	“ You seem so stiff and angry . ”
44825	44837	44848	44848	her	58	“ I do n’t know how to do this , Gretchen . ”
44838	44841	44848	44848	her	58	“ Hmm ? ”
44851	44860	44848	44848	her	58	“ Do n’t know how to touch me ? ”
44861	44864	44848	44848	her	58	“ No , ”
44879	44892	44848	44848	her	58	“ I ’ve never . . . I do n’t . . . ”
44893	44901	44908	44908	he	57	“ That ’s all right , Hunter . ”
44902	44907	44960	44960	he	57	“ It ’s not , ”
44971	44983	45019	45019	his	57	“ It ’s . . . not . . . okay . ”
44984	45014	45027	45027	He	57	“ I know you ’re a virgin , Hunter . I guessed as much . You were so young when you were hurt , I just assumed . . . ”
45034	45088	45097	45097	she	58	“ I just wanted you to know that it ’s not you . It ’s me . It ’s all me , and if I push you away it ’s because I do n’t know how to pull you close . I ’m not . . . I ’m not good with people . ”
45089	45096	45097	45097	she	58	“ I ’m not , either , ”
45104	45127	45136	45136	he	947	“ I do n’t know if you ’ve noticed , but I tend to blurt out the first thing I ’m thinking . ”
45128	45135	45136	45136	he	947	“ I like that about you , ”
45141	45148	45153	45153	She	58	“ I like everything about you . ”
45149	45152	45153	45153	She	58	“ Mmm . ”
45179	45225	45231	45231	she	58	“ I ca n’t stop thinking about you , Gretchen . I want to touch you all over . Explore you . Give you pleasure like I ’m supposed to , but every time you touch me , I just . . . lose it . ”
45226	45230	45263	45263	she	58	“ Hair trigger ? ”
45250	45262	45263	45263	she	58	“ Hunter . It ’s okay . I do n’t mind , ”
45267	45279	45295	45295	He	947	“ Is it me ? Am I too forward for you ? ”
45280	45294	45347	45347	He	947	“ No . I like you forward . It ’s just . . . ”
45333	45346	45361	45361	she	58	“ Do you want to explore me ? I do n’t mind . ”
45357	45360	45375	45375	She	58	“ Here , ”
45388	45432	45484	45484	her	58	“ I ’ll put my hands here and I wo n’t move them . You can touch me how you like , and I promise not to touch you back . We ’ll go as slow as you need to . I promise . ”
45487	45497	45511	45511	Her	58	“ What should I — what do you want ? ”
45498	45510	45511	45511	Her	58	“ Whatever you like . I ’m here for the taking . ”
45533	45544	45567	45567	He	57	“ This is your game . You ’re in charge . ”
45579	45591	45567	45567	He	57	“ You can go higher , you know . Nothing bites . ”
45592	45604	45720	45720	she	58	“ I know . I ’m just . . . enjoying . ”
45712	45719	45720	45720	she	58	“ Now we ’re getting somewhere , ”
45736	45744	45752	45752	she	58	“ Are you . . . nervous ? ”
45745	45751	45763	45763	her	58	“ I ’m mostly excited , ”
45766	45800	45923	45923	himself	57	“ Full of anticipation . My belly — and other parts of me — are tingling with it . I ’ve been trying to get you to touch me for a week now . ”
45927	45958	45987	45987	he	57	“ If you want to take that shirt off me , you ’re going to have to do it on your own . I ca n’t help you , remember ? ”
45977	45986	46010	46010	she	58	“ I thought I was in charge here ? ”
45991	46009	46010	46010	she	58	“ You are . I ’m just bossy even if I ’m supposed to be all submissive , ”
46017	46031	46010	46010	she	58	“ You can always spank me for being bad , if you want . ”
46038	46049	46061	46061	She	58	“ Gretchen , please . I need to keep control . ”
46050	46060	46061	46061	She	58	“ Oh , of course . I ’m sorry . ”
46070	46101	46061	46061	She	58	“ I ’ll just lay here and be quiet . All silent and needy and half - naked , but very willing to be fully naked if given the opportunity . ”
46118	46127	46128	46128	Her	58	“ What if I ripped this off you ? ”
46135	46148	46187	46187	he	57	“ That would be extremely naughty of you . I ’m game . ”
46192	46201	46247	46247	Gretchen	58	“ You going to rip my panties next ? ”
46259	46264	46358	46358	she	58	“ Are they sexy ? ”
46265	46300	46358	46358	she	58	“ Mmm , not really . They ’re boy shorts with a bit of lace . I was n’t really coming here expecting to get laid , so I did n’t pack my best . ”
46301	46314	46247	46247	Gretchen	58	“ I . . . do n’t know what boy shorts are . ”
46315	46326	46336	46336	He	57	“ Then yes , they ’re incredibly , ultra sexy . ”
46327	46335	46588	46588	she	58	“ Then I should n’t rip them . ”
46582	46587	46588	46588	she	58	“ You ’re quiet , ”
46591	46595	46560	46560	She	58	“ Just thinking . ”
46596	46607	46588	46588	she	58	“ Uh - oh . Good thinking or bad thinking ? ”
46608	46616	46588	46588	she	58	“ Thinking about you . Good thinking . ”
46617	46624	46560	46560	She	58	“ Sexy thinking , I hope . ”
46625	46634	46639	46639	she	58	“ Thinking about where to touch you next . ”
46635	46638	46639	46639	she	58	“ Wellllll , ”
46642	46661	46670	46670	he	57	“ I ’m told my feet are quite ugly . I ’d advise against heading in that direction . ”
46662	46669	46693	46693	she	58	“ Nothing on you is ugly , ”
46683	46692	46746	46746	he	57	“ Perhaps you did not see my feet , ”
46754	46760	46761	46761	She	58	“ Feels lovely to me . ”
46767	46773	46746	46746	he	57	“ Your fingers are ticklish . ”
46774	46779	46799	46799	Hunter	57	“ Should I stop ? ”
46780	46798	46857	46857	His	57	“ No . It ’s not a bad ticklish . Just . . . makes me shiver . ”
46846	46856	46857	46857	His	57	“ Oh , okay . That feels pretty good . ”
46868	46876	46940	46940	Her	58	“ You ’re very soft , Gretchen . ”
46877	46939	46972	46972	He	57	“ Mmm , yeah . I ’m pretty soft all over , I hear . All those hours at the computer and stuff . It does n’t exactly lend itself to tons of muscles . Gardening seems to be working for you , though . That ’s one amazing six - pack I saw when you got out of the shower . ”
46975	46995	47011	47011	Her	58	“ I do n’t just garden , you know . I have a gym and I work out daily . ”
47023	47034	47035	47035	Her	58	“ Holy crap , Hunter . Did you just laugh ? ”
47042	47063	47097	47097	Her	58	“ I ’m so bummed . I finally got you to laugh and I did n’t get to see it . ”
47103	47112	47120	47120	He	57	“ Does this bother you ? My touch ? ”
47129	47133	47223	47223	Her	58	“ Go ahead . ”
47205	47222	47223	47223	Her	58	“ I do n’t find you ugly , Hunter . No one who knew you could . ”
47229	47279	47483	47483	He	57	“ If anything , I ’m grateful that you have these scars , because they saved you for me — for this moment in time . And that ’s a little selfish of me , is n’t it ? And yet I ca n’t help but feel that way . ”
47478	47482	47525	47525	He	57	“ Too much ? ”
47538	47549	47560	47560	She	58	“ Is n’t this supposed to be on the headboard ? ”
47550	47559	47560	47560	She	58	“ Oooh , right . I got distracted . ”
47563	47574	47597	47597	she	58	“ Guess you ’ll have to spank me , huh ? ”
47600	47615	47597	47597	she	58	“ Hands are now back in place . Do with me as you will . ”
47616	47625	47643	47643	she	58	“ I ’m not going to spank you . ”
47635	47641	47677	47677	She	58	“ You ’re no fun . ”
47683	47689	47875	47875	She	58	“ Mmmm . Keep going . ”
47886	47889	47935	47935	Her	58	“ Hunter ? ”
47922	47934	47935	47935	Her	58	“ Hunter ? Where are you ? Please do n’t leave . ”
47940	47954	47989	47989	He	57	“ I . . . I ca n’t stay . I . . . ”
47974	47988	47989	47989	He	57	“ But your touch feels so good . And I ache so bad . ”
47995	48003	48008	48008	he	57	“ Wo n’t you come touch me ? ”
48004	48007	48008	48008	he	57	“ Gretchen , ”
48012	48022	48053	48053	Astonishment	105	“ I . . . need to clean up . ”
48037	48052	48073	48073	she	58	“ After you clean up , will you come back and finish touching me ? ”
48081	48090	48073	48073	she	58	“ You still want me to touch you ? ”
48091	48104	48073	48073	she	58	“ Hey , you got yours . I want to get mine . ”
48105	48123	48137	48137	she	58	“ But that ’s not how this works . I wanted to make it good for you . ”
48124	48136	48137	48137	she	58	“ And I intend on you making it good for me , ”
48140	48161	48173	48173	he	57	“ No sense in us stopping now if we ’re having fun . And I thought we were having fun . ”
48162	48172	48173	48173	he	57	“ Some of us were having too much fun , ”
48183	48207	48137	48137	she	58	“ Oh , my God , did you just make a joke ? I should leave you in the dark all the time . ”
48208	48212	48242	48242	He	57	“ Very funny . ”
48213	48241	48284	48284	Hunter	57	“ I know . I ’m full of sparkling humor . Sparkling humor and soft , soft skin that you need to come over here and touch . ”
48249	48283	48331	48331	she	58	“ I think there ’s a stack of towels on the chair by the fireplace . Fix yourself up and come back to me . I ’m just going to wait right here . ”
48324	48330	48408	48408	Hunter	57	“ Are you coming back ? ”
48411	48423	48643	48643	he	57	“ Touch me , Hunter . Use your fingers on me . ”
48656	48661	48677	48677	She	58	“ Oh , God . ”
48667	48676	48727	48727	she	58	“ Right there . Oh , keep going . ”
48721	48726	48736	48736	He	57	“ More , Hunter , ”
48730	48735	48771	48771	she	58	“ I need more . ”
48764	48770	48771	48771	she	58	“ My clit , baby , ”
48775	48784	49079	49079	she	58	“ Get my clit for me , baby . ”
49073	49078	49079	49079	she	58	“ Mmmm , Hunter ? ”
49090	49099	49079	49079	she	58	“ You ’re not leaving , are you ? ”
49107	49119	49127	49127	He	57	“ I ’m not . . . I fucked this up . ”
49120	49126	49127	49127	He	57	“ Fucked it up how ? ”
49131	49166	49167	49167	She	58	“ Hunter , if it ’s because you ’re still a virgin , do n’t worry about it . We ’ll take our time . I ’m kind of enjoying endless amounts of foreplay . ”
49172	49186	49191	49191	he	57	“ You did n’t bring a condom with you tonight , did you ? ”
49187	49190	49191	49191	he	57	“ No , ”
49194	49238	49241	49241	her	58	“ Well , then , there ’s no sense in hating on yourself , is there ? No glove , no love . It ’s probably a good thing that we never got further than the heavy petting . Now , come on . ”
49246	49259	49348	49348	she	58	“ I kind of felt like cuddling , if you ’re game . ”
49342	49347	49348	49348	she	58	“ That was incredible , ”
49356	49360	49369	49369	he	57	“ Thank you . ”
49361	49368	49369	49369	he	57	“ I should be thanking you , ”
49373	49388	49389	49389	She	58	“ Mmm , I do n’t know . You have a very talented mouth . ”
49392	49403	49406	49406	his	57	“ Do n’t sneak away on me again , okay ? ”
49427	49432	49824	49824	He	57	“ I wo n’t . ”
49829	49834	49929	49929	her	58	“ What the fuck — ”
49877	49880	49890	49890	she	58	“ Mmm ? ”
49893	49900	49890	49890	she	58	“ I see you met Igor . ”
49907	49913	49890	49890	she	58	“ This is your cat ? ”
49914	49918	49925	49925	She	58	“ It is . ”
49919	49924	49929	49929	her	58	“ He ’s naked . ”
49940	49949	49960	49960	Hunter	57	“ That makes three of us , then . ”
49963	49969	49985	49985	Her	58	“ Gretchen , do n’t — ”
49970	49984	49998	49998	She	58	“ Do n’t touch you ? Did someone wake up with morning wood ? ”
50017	50024	49998	49998	She	58	“ Mmm , you sure did . ”
50025	50031	50087	50087	She	58	“ Can you blame me ? ”
50079	50086	50089	50089	her	58	“ So it ’s my fault ? ”
50099	50114	50158	50158	Gretchen	58	“ Guess I should take care of it for you , should n’t I ? ”
50171	50189	50195	50195	she	58	“ Gretchen , I . . . oh , fuck . You ’re amazing . So amazing . ”
50190	50194	50438	50438	She	58	“ I know , ”
50453	50465	50481	50481	Her	58	“ Just a little something to start the day off right . ”
50466	50480	50485	50485	she	58	“ The day started off right when I woke up and saw you . ”
50497	50517	51024	51024	Gretchen	58	“ Keep saying stuff like that and it ’s going to be very hard to get rid of me . ”
51031	51034	51056	51056	She	58	“ Hello ? ”
51035	51055	51056	51056	She	58	“ Gretchen , honey , tell me you ’re hitting send on that Astronaut Bill manuscript as we speak ? ”
51059	51080	51024	51024	Gretchen	58	“ Hey , Kat . And um , it ’s not done . I still need another week or two . ”
51081	51102	51056	51056	She	58	“ Gretch ! You told me you ’d have it done in a week . . . two weeks ago . ”
51103	51127	51173	51173	he	57	“ I know . This other project has been a little more . . . time consuming than I thought it would be . ”
51201	51234	51173	51173	he	57	“ Well , ca n’t you put the project aside for a few days and finish this other one ? Just have Bill shag Uranus in her anus and send it off . ”
51235	51250	51332	51332	Kat	77	“ Uranea and the publisher would freak out if I threw in butt sex . ”
51251	51331	51332	51332	Kat	77	“ Whatever , and the publisher ’s freaking out right now because you ’re grossly overdue . Gretchen , they ’re going to fire you if you do n’t get this book in . I ’m your agent . I ’m supposed to tell you when you ’re doing bad career moves , right ? This is a bad one . Very bad . Can you just sit down and hammer out a few chapters for me ? Please ? ”
51338	51362	51363	51363	Gretchen	58	“ So I do n’t have to make an ugly phone call about how my favorite client did n’t hit her deadline again ? ”
51371	51387	51173	51173	he	57	“ I ’m pulling up the document as we speak , Kat . I promise . ”
51388	51401	51332	51332	Kat	77	“ Good . Think you can send it to me by tomorrow ? ”
51402	51405	51363	51363	Gretchen	58	“ Ummm . ”
51406	51421	51173	51173	he	57	“ I ’ll take that as a yes . Do n’t tell me otherwise . ”
51422	51425	51444	51444	Kat	77	“ Okay . ”
51426	51443	51450	51450	Gretchen	58	“ Since I have you on the phone , I did have a chat with Preston . ”
51458	51477	51173	51173	he	57	“ Preston Stewart ’s the editor for the new publisher , right ? What was the name again ? ”
51478	51486	51173	51173	he	57	“ That ’s him . Bellefleur Publishing . ”
51487	51514	51450	51450	Gretchen	58	“ Uh - huh . Did they ask for me because the Astronaut Bill stuff is pulp and I ’m used to writing in some sex ? ”
51515	51527	51541	51541	Kat	77	“ Huh ? What does that have to do with anything ? ”
51528	51540	51541	51541	Kat	77	“ The letters . Does he know these are dirty letters ? ”
51544	51548	51450	51450	Gretchen	58	“ Say what ? ”
51549	51607	51617	51617	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m serious ! The trunk is full of letters between a gal named Lula and her boyfriend , Ben . It took years for them to be together , and so apparently they spent all that time in - between visits sending dirty recaps to each other . Want me to read you a page ? ”
51608	51616	51617	51617	Gretchen	58	“ Dirty letters ? Are you sure ? ”
51629	51662	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ My dearest Ben . I woke up this morning , my woman ’s flesh aching with need for you . I dreamed that you were deep inside me , your rod — ”
51663	51668	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Okay , okay ! ”
51673	51696	51704	51704	Gretchen	58	“ Oh , man . Well , that ’s going to be a wicked cool marketing angle , that ’s for sure . ”
51697	51703	51704	51704	Gretchen	58	“ If you say so , ”
51709	51748	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Apparently these two lovebirds went to a lot of Victorian house parties and used every excuse to sneak off and make out while there . They ’re kind of creative with things . It ’s rather inspiring . ”
51749	51782	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ I ’ll say . Anyhow , back to Preston . He ’s super excited about your book , too . How ’s it feel to be a lead title , kiddo ? ”
51783	51795	51802	51802	Kat	77	“ I . . . have n’t given it much thought . ”
51796	51801	51802	51802	Kat	77	“ You have n’t ? ”
51805	51815	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ What ’s going on with you , Gretchen ? ”
51816	51830	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ I ’ve been , um , distracted . I met a guy . ”
51831	51853	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ A guy ? Audrey told me all about that horrible butler . Do n’t tell me you fell for him ? ”
51854	51866	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Jeez , Kat , when did you talk to Audrey ? ”
51867	51897	51910	51910	Gretchen	58	“ We went for lunch the other day . I had some books for her to pick up for the charity and we ended up going out for drinkies . ”
51898	51909	51910	51910	Gretchen	58	“ I think I need to widen my social circle , ”
51913	51937	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ And no , I did n’t fall for the butler . But I just might be kinda - sorta shagging his boss . ”
51938	51945	51966	51966	Gretchen	58	“ You what ? The billionaire ? ”
51971	51982	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ He ’s different , Kat . I like him . ”
51983	51994	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Of course you like him . He ’s rich ! ”
51995	52008	51966	51966	Gretchen	58	“ Can we talk about something other than how much he makes ? ”
52009	52020	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Sure . What kind of car does he drive ? ”
52021	52039	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Not funny . I like him because he ’s different , not because he ’s rich . ”
52040	52083	52098	52098	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m just teasing you , Gretchen . It ’s good that you met someone . I just wish he was n’t directly tied to the job you ’re doing . As your agent , that makes me a little uncomfortable . ”
52084	52097	52098	52098	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s not like he ’s actually involved in the project , ”
52102	52116	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ He just happens to own the house the letters were found in . ”
52117	52136	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Very , very dirty letters . You sure you ’re not getting inspired by these dirty letters ? ”
52137	52144	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Give me a little credit ? ”
52145	52158	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Just a little . I ’d like to meet this guy . ”
52159	52177	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ We ’re just fooling around , Kat . It ’s not like this is anything official . ”
52178	52199	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ I do n’t care . I still want to meet him . Maybe he has a sexy younger brother . ”
52200	52231	52245	52245	Kat	77	“ He ’s an only child . But I ’ll see what I can do about getting some friends together . This house would be a great place to entertain . ”
52248	52280	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ Oooh , maybe we can do a Victorian house party ! We can invite your editor so he can get excited about the progress you ’re making on the book . ”
52281	52287	51669	51669	Kat	77	“ I do n’t know — ”
52288	52314	52245	52245	Kat	77	“ And the publicist ! And a photographer . Think of the angle we can spin on things to get some in - house excitement . ”
52315	52348	52382	52382	Gretchen	58	“ I do n’t know if the owner of the house is going to be particularly excited about this . He ’s pretty reclusive . And by pretty , I mean completely . ”
52349	52381	52382	52382	Gretchen	58	“ So , you can just take him into a closet and play Seven Minutes in Heaven or something . Victorian house party coming up ! So where ’s my invite ? ”
52385	52394	52245	52245	Kat	77	“ Let me work on him , Kat . ”
52395	52419	52382	52382	Gretchen	58	“ Tell him it ’ll be good for your career . You need as much in - house support as you can get . ”
52420	52425	52541	52541	She	58	“ We ’ll see . ”
52473	52540	52541	52541	She	58	“ Oh , Astronaut Bill , what can we do ? The universe is doomed for sure . The solarship with the cargo full of super - plutonium is headed straight for the galaxy warp . If we ca n’t get on board somehow , it ’ll cut across space and head straight for the planet of my people , Vifraxa . Billions will be doomed . ”
52551	52561	52597	52597	He	69	“ You must find a way to save them . ”
52586	52596	52599	52599	his	69	“ We ’ll find a way to stop them . ”
52602	52614	53180	53180	he	84	“ I have it ! All we need to do is — ”
53183	53193	53180	53180	he	84	“ What are you doing in the north wing ? ”
53194	53226	53235	53235	She	58	“ Hello to you , too . I ’m looking for Hunter . He ’s not in his room and not in the greenhouse . Any idea where he would be ? ”
53227	53234	53235	53235	She	58	“ I ’m not his keeper . ”
53245	53262	53180	53180	he	84	“ I know you ’re not . Ca n’t you just tell me where he is ? ”
53263	53266	53277	53277	She	58	“ Why ? ”
53267	53276	53277	53277	She	58	“ I ’m going to go deflower him . ”
53288	53302	53180	53180	he	84	“ Hey , you asked . Now , seriously , where is he ? ”
53303	53311	53327	53327	he	84	“ You ’re a vile young woman . ”
53312	53325	53331	53331	she	58	“ Yeah , well , you ’re kind of a dick yourself . ”
53334	53394	53411	53411	he	84	“ Look , Eldon , I just want to spend some time with your boss . I do n’t think he ’d be keen on you keeping information from me . You may not like me , but he does . So spill the beans or I ’m going to tell him you ’re trying to keep us apart . ”
53414	53422	53426	53426	Eldon	84	“ Did you look in his office ? ”
53441	53450	53464	53464	He	84	“ No , where ’s his office at ? ”
53451	53463	53474	53474	she	1004	“ Second floor , west wing . Third door on right . ”
53468	53473	53563	53563	Hunter	57	“ Grumpy , grumpy , ”
53559	53562	53806	53806	his	57	“ Enter , ”
53809	53812	53820	53820	He	57	“ Gretchen ? ”
53813	53819	53855	53855	She	1004	“ Hey . You busy ? ”
53836	53854	53876	53876	she	1004	“ Just have a few meetings today I ca n’t reschedule . What are you doing here ? ”
53887	53898	53876	53876	she	1004	“ I thought I ’d come by and devirgin you . ”
53904	53907	53919	53919	She	1004	“ What ? ”
53908	53918	53924	53924	her	1004	“ Your virginity — I’ve come to take it . ”
53934	53944	53953	53953	His	57	“ Unless you ’re not interested , of course . ”
53945	53952	53982	53982	her	58	“ What happened to going slow ? ”
54001	54016	53982	53982	her	58	“ I promise to go slow , if that makes you feel any better ? ”
54017	54020	54082	54082	She	58	“ Gretchen — ”
54021	54081	54098	54098	His	57	“ The way I figure it is that we ’ve been going about this all wrong . I thought taking it nice and slow would make you feel more comfortable , but now I ’m thinking we should treat this like ripping off a Band - Aid — make it rough and fast so you wo n’t overthink things . ”
54112	54121	54132	54132	he	57	“ Parts of you are interested at least . ”
54122	54131	54132	54132	he	57	“ All of me is interested , Gretchen , ”
54139	54156	54161	54161	She	58	“ But I have a conference call in two minutes and I ca n’t reschedule it . ”
54157	54160	54161	54161	She	58	“ Mmm . ”
54169	54184	54195	54195	She	58	“ I can stick around , you know . I promise to be quiet . ”
54185	54194	54232	54232	He	57	“ I wo n’t be able to concentrate — ”
54250	54255	54353	54353	He	57	“ Hunter Buchanan here . ”
54364	54373	54381	54381	she	58	“ Do n’t move like that . Please . ”
54374	54380	54395	54395	He	57	“ I ’ll be good , ”
54406	54416	54753	54753	she	58	“ No , I ’m here . Go on . ”
54747	54752	54756	54756	He	57	“ Why the mirror ? ”
54772	54785	54792	54792	she	58	“ So I never forget who — and what — I am . ”
54786	54791	54802	54802	he	57	“ That ’s depressing , ”
54806	54816	54823	54823	Hunter	57	“ You know who does that ? Emo people . ”
54817	54822	54858	54858	he	57	“ Uh - huh , ”
54864	54873	54955	54955	he	57	“ How many inspectors did you send out ? ”
54971	54974	54985	54985	he	57	“ Mmmhmm . ”
54997	55001	55075	55075	he	57	“ Go on . ”
55083	55092	55102	55102	she	58	“ You ’re not playing fair , Gretchen . ”
55093	55101	55102	55102	she	58	“ You told me to go on , ”
55109	55113	55114	55114	His	57	“ Goddamn it . ”
55122	55138	55146	55146	she	58	“ I ’m going to have to fight fire with fire , are n’t I ? ”
55139	55145	55211	55211	he	57	“ I wish you would , ”
55202	55210	55211	55211	he	57	“ I ’m a very busy man , ”
55224	55232	55239	55239	she	58	“ I ca n’t afford these distractions . ”
55233	55238	55258	55258	He	57	“ Of course not , ”
55267	55273	55283	55283	she	58	“ You ’re soaked already . ”
55274	55282	55283	55283	she	58	“ Thinking about you gets me hot , ”
55294	55300	55355	55355	He	57	“ Ca n’t help myself . ”
55366	55385	55394	55394	his	57	“ I ’m going to have to drop off the call . Someone send me the meeting minutes . ”
55402	55411	55427	55427	he	57	“ You ’re derailing my plans , Gretchen . ”
55435	55453	55455	55455	she	58	“ You derailed mine . I kept thinking about you and could n’t get any work done . ”
55468	55479	55515	55515	Her	58	“ Clearly you need a taste of your own medicine . ”
55506	55514	55533	55533	he	57	“ Is this your idea of punishment ? ”
55522	55532	55599	55599	she	58	“ Actually , I just want to touch you , ”
55589	55597	55622	55622	His	57	“ Then touch me all you want . ”
55649	55669	55682	55682	she	58	“ Gretchen , I do n’t know how long I ’ll last with you on my lap like this . ”
55670	55681	55703	55703	He	57	“ Then maybe we should get that condom on you , ”
55686	55702	55774	55774	He	57	“ And then I can get back on your lap after you put it on . ”
55783	55796	55940	55940	he	57	“ I can do this . I want you to get naked . ”
55934	55939	56022	56022	She	58	“ Sit down again , ”
56013	56021	56117	56117	he	57	“ Take me inside you , Gretchen . ”
56111	56116	56117	56117	he	57	“ Ah , fuck , ”
56120	56125	56235	56235	he	57	“ You feel amazing . ”
56241	56255	56277	56277	she	58	“ Never thought I ’d feel anything so good , Gretchen . Never . ”
56269	56276	56290	56290	His	57	“ The fun ’s just starting , ”
56296	56299	56290	56290	His	57	“ Ah ! ”
56300	56316	56321	56321	he	57	“ Oh , Hunter . You ’re so deep inside me . That feels unbelievable . ”
56317	56320	56436	56436	she	58	“ Gretchen , ”
56429	56435	56436	56436	she	58	“ Touch me , Hunter , ”
56448	56458	56549	56549	he	57	“ I ’ve got you . Just touch me . ”
56545	56548	56549	56549	he	57	“ Damn , ”
56555	56576	56584	56584	she	58	“ I think I like you being on top , but I want to be in charge for a bit . ”
56577	56583	56616	56616	he	57	“ I ’m all yours , ”
56611	56615	56616	56616	he	57	“ Lean forward , ”
56626	56631	56671	56671	he	57	“ On the desk . ”
56666	56670	56868	56868	she	58	“ Forward more , ”
56864	56867	56868	56868	she	58	“ Hunter , ”
56871	56880	56955	56955	he	57	“ Oh , God , keep doing that ! ”
56963	56974	56987	56987	he	57	“ Oh , God , Hunter , keep fucking me . ”
56975	56986	56987	56987	he	57	“ So . . . damn . . . naughty , ”
56994	57004	57010	57010	she	58	“ You ’re such a fucking tease , Gretchen . ”
57005	57009	57010	57010	she	58	“ I am , ”
57013	57025	57094	57094	she	58	“ I like teasing you . You like it , too . ”
57100	57106	57206	57206	She	58	“ Need you , Hunter . ”
57215	57222	57252	57252	He	57	“ Hunter ! Hunter ! Hunter ! ”
57223	57251	57252	57252	He	57	“ I can feel you coming , Gretchen . Ah , damn it . You ’re so tight on my cock . God , I love that . ”
57269	57274	57279	57279	she	58	“ Fuck . Fuck . ”
57275	57278	57296	57296	he	57	“ Yes , ”
57292	57295	57419	57419	he	57	“ Fuck , ”
57413	57418	57419	57419	he	57	“ Ah , Gretchen , ”
57424	57430	57435	57435	she	58	“ Ah , fuck me . ”
57431	57434	57435	57435	she	58	“ Again ? ”
57442	57449	57470	57470	His	57	“ Give a girl a moment . ”
57478	57485	57494	57494	she	58	“ God , that was incredible . ”
57486	57493	57500	57500	His	57	“ Mmmhmm , it sure was , ”
57513	57523	57546	57546	him	57	“ I do n’t want to stop touching you . ”
57551	57561	57570	57570	he	57	“ We only have the one condom , Hunter . ”
57562	57569	57570	57570	he	57	“ I ’m still in you , ”
57574	57593	57631	57631	She	58	“ And after my shower , I ’m ordering Eldon to get a box of a hundred condoms . ”
57627	57630	57652	57652	he	57	“ Oooh . ”
57659	57675	57680	57680	he	57	“ A hundred condoms ? You ’re very optimistic about either my stamina or yours . ”
57676	57679	57716	57716	He	57	“ Both , ”
57698	57715	57885	57885	he	57	“ I want you to come for me again . This time I want to watch . ”
57881	57884	58663	58663	She	58	“ Beautiful , ”
58658	58662	58692	58692	he	57	“ Come in . ”
58706	58710	58721	58721	He	57	“ Going out ? ”
58711	58720	58721	58721	He	57	“ I have a . . . meeting . ”
58734	58746	58757	58757	She	58	“ I do n’t know what time I ’ll be back . ”
58747	58756	58757	58757	She	58	“ Oh . Well , that ’s disappointing . ”
58766	58781	58786	58786	Hunter	57	“ I guess I wo n’t stay up and wait for you , then . ”
58782	58785	58794	58794	He	57	“ Actually , ”
58810	58834	58839	58839	She	58	“ If you want to wait in my bed for me , I ’d be happy to wake you up when I return . ”
58835	58838	58839	58839	She	58	“ Mmmm . ”
58856	58861	58883	58883	he	57	“ We ’ll see . ”
58891	58900	58905	58905	Gretchen	58	“ I ’ll make it up to you . ”
58901	58904	58905	58905	Gretchen	58	“ Actually , ”
58908	58961	58962	58962	She	58	“ I wanted to talk to you about having a small get - together of some kind . My agent is really pushing for a small house party here , since it ’d give me a good chance to spend time with my editor and tie in the project with the house . ”
58969	58984	58990	58990	his	57	“ Feel free to tell me no . I know this is your house . ”
58998	59004	59014	59014	she	58	“ Would this please you ? ”
59005	59013	59014	59014	she	58	“ Not if it makes you uncomfortable , ”
59019	59059	59072	59072	he	57	“ But it ’d get my agent and my editor off my back for a while , which would be nice . I figured you could invite your friends , though . Maybe that ’d make things less painful . ”
59060	59071	59072	59072	he	57	“ I . . . am not good with strangers , ”
59075	59083	59092	59092	she	58	“ Is it because of your face ? ”
59097	59115	59116	59116	He	57	“ You do n’t have anything to be uncomfortable about . I find your scars incredibly sexy . ”
59123	59132	59143	59143	she	58	“ My scars are not attractive , Gretchen . ”
59133	59142	59163	59163	her	58	“ On anyone else they would n’t be , ”
59177	59186	59194	59194	he	57	“ But on you , they arouse me . ”
59209	59243	59250	59250	He	57	“ I ca n’t miss this meeting , Gretchen . But you ’re making me want to leave early . If you want to have this party , it ’s fine with me . ”
59244	59249	59276	59276	he	57	“ Are you sure ? ”
59280	59305	59313	59313	she	58	“ As long as you ’re in my bed tonight when I come home , you can have as many parties as you want . ”
59306	59312	59364	59364	Reese	109	“ I ’ll be there , ”
59375	59380	59410	59410	Reese	109	“ I ’m out . ”
59403	59409	59410	59410	Reese	109	“ You should have stayed . ”
59415	59431	59436	59436	Griffin	66	“ I ca n’t read you tonight . You ’re being . . . weird . ”
59432	59435	59452	59452	He	66	“ Weird ? ”
59462	59467	59475	59475	Reese	109	“ Weird like how ? ”
59468	59474	59479	59479	He	66	“ I do n’t know , ”
59490	59504	59511	59511	Cade	65	“ I ca n’t put my finger on it . It ’s different . ”
59505	59510	59522	59522	Cade	65	“ He ’s happy , ”
59527	59565	59592	59592	He	57	“ I ’ve seen him smile twice tonight . He does n’t scowl when someone suggests something , and he ’s actually participated in every conversation and not all of it about business . He ’s happy . ”
59600	59604	59653	59653	He	1066	“ Your deal . ”
59665	59670	59692	59692	Logan	55	“ Everyone ante up . ”
59702	59705	59718	59718	He	55	“ What ? ”
59711	59717	59750	59750	He	57	“ What ’s going on ? ”
59739	59749	59750	59750	He	57	“ Cade ’s right . You ’re downright cheerful . ”
59755	59766	59799	59799	He	55	“ You ’re one to talk . How ’s Brontë ? ”
59775	59798	59799	59799	He	55	“ In a state of crisis . She ’s trying to take classes and expand her reading charity at the same time . ”
59818	59833	59907	59907	Logan	55	“ And she keeps complaining that I wo n’t let her get any sleep . ”
59896	59906	59907	59907	Logan	55	“ It ’s a woman , is n’t it ? ”
59913	59923	59928	59928	Hunter	57	“ That redhead you asked Brontë about . Greta ? ”
59924	59927	59928	59928	Hunter	57	“ Gretchen , ”
59939	59948	59956	59956	Logan	55	“ She ’s the sister of your assistant . ”
59949	59955	59986	59986	His	55	“ Audrey has a sister ? ”
59964	59985	60006	60006	Cade	65	“ Ah , right , the one Brontë stayed with for a time . Brontë likes her quite a bit . ”
59999	60005	60017	60017	Hunter	57	“ She has two sisters , ”
60009	60016	60017	60017	Hunter	57	“ Daphne lives out in LA . ”
60022	60027	60028	60028	Cade	65	“ You know them ? ”
60036	60053	60085	60085	he	57	“ Old family friends . We go back to childhood . You in on this hand ? ”
60073	60084	60085	60085	he	57	“ Gretchen wants me to invite a few friends over , ”
60092	60099	60110	60110	Reese	109	“ A party of some kind . ”
60100	60109	60121	60121	Hunter	57	“ Does this mean we ’re all invited ? ”
60117	60120	60127	60127	Jonathan	67	“ No , ”
60136	60150	60161	60161	Cade	65	“ I admit I ’m curious to see this sister of Audrey ’s . ”
60151	60160	60161	60161	Cade	65	“ You ’ve seen one of them before , ”
60165	60169	60179	60179	Reese	109	“ Daphne Petty . ”
60183	60201	60209	60209	Logan	55	“ No way . Daphne Petty ? The Daphne Petty ? The one in the tabloids constantly ? ”
60202	60208	60237	60237	Cade	65	“ Who ’s Daphne Petty ? ”
60228	60236	60237	60237	Cade	65	“ An old childhood friend of mine , ”
60240	60266	60272	60272	Logan	55	“ And Audrey ’s twin . She ’s also — if rumor has it — heavily into drugs and alcohol , thanks to her career . ”
60267	60271	60272	60272	Logan	55	“ Her career , ”
60276	60282	60303	60303	Reese	109	“ What career is this ? ”
60283	60302	60321	60321	Cade	65	“ Singer . Pick up any magazine and you ’ll probably see her sloppy drunk on the cover , ”
60306	60320	60321	60321	Cade	65	“ Holy crap . I never knew . Audrey looks nothing like her . ”
60326	60343	60411	60411	Gretchen	58	“ I know . Daphne ’s not . . . well . Audrey ’s much healthier . ”
60418	60423	60447	60447	Jonathan	67	“ mind your own business ”
60441	60446	60447	60447	Jonathan	67	“ Ah , hell , ”
60452	60468	60480	60480	Reese	109	“ He ’s grinning again . Whatever it is , he ’s got it bad . ”
60469	60479	60480	60480	Reese	109	“ Now I ’m definitely coming to this party , ”
60483	60489	60524	60524	Cade	65	“ You were n’t invited , ”
60514	60523	60552	60552	Hunter	57	“ You ’re in the Brotherhood , Hunter , ”
60533	60551	60577	60577	Hunter	57	“ You know our rules . We ’re all invited . Even the obnoxious ones like Reese . ”
60582	60588	60577	60577	Hunter	57	“ I need your advice . ”
60589	60595	60619	60619	Logan	55	“ Oh ? On what ? ”
60596	60618	60619	60619	Logan	55	“ On Gretchen . I want to do something for her . Something that shows her how much I appreciate her . ”
60626	60634	60577	60577	Hunter	57	“ Do n’t buy her a diner . ”
60635	60638	60577	60577	Hunter	57	“ What ? ”
60639	60661	60619	60619	Logan	55	“ Nothing . Just something I did for Brontë that backfired in my face . What did you have in mind ? ”
60662	60679	60690	60690	Logan	55	“ Something . . . thoughtful . Not jewelry . She ’s not a jewelry type . ”
60680	60689	60690	60690	Logan	55	“ Well , you dodged a bullet there , ”
60693	60745	60748	60748	his	57	“ Then again , jewelry makes it easy . Brontë ’s not much of a jewelry type , either . Gets mad every time I try to buy her a necklace . The trick is you have to find something that you can do for her that no one else can . ”
60751	60777	60807	60807	He	57	“ I do n’t know what that would be . Property ? It ’s too much . Cars ? Anyone can give her a car . ”
60817	60826	60834	60834	Logan	55	“ You said she likes books , right ? ”
60827	60833	60834	60834	Logan	55	“ She ’s a ghostwriter . ”
60837	60851	60852	60852	Hunter	57	“ There ’s your answer . Something with books . Is she successful ? ”
60856	60870	60910	60910	Logan	55	“ I do n’t know . She writes astronaut books or some such . ”
60899	60909	60910	60910	Logan	55	“ So buy them . Buy all of them . ”
60924	60938	60946	60946	Hunter	57	“ I should n’t smoke this . Brontë does n’t like the smell . ”
60939	60945	60946	60946	Hunter	57	“ Buy all of them ? ”
60949	60970	60946	60946	Hunter	57	“ All the books . Get her on the bestseller list or something . That would probably make her happy . ”
60985	60995	61498	61498	She	58	“ I ’ll get Eldon on it right away . ”
61509	61516	61521	61521	His	57	“ Hunter ? Is that you ? ”
61517	61520	61530	61530	he	57	“ Gretchen . ”
61543	61550	61571	61571	she	58	“ I need you so badly . ”
61561	61570	61571	61571	she	58	“ I was having dirty dreams about you , ”
61574	61579	61580	61580	He	57	“ Am I wet ? ”
61593	61597	61605	61605	she	58	“ Very wet . ”
61598	61604	61673	61673	she	58	“ Then come inside me , ”
61664	61672	61695	61695	He	57	“ Ah , that ’s so good , ”
61687	61694	61792	61792	She	58	“ Fuck me hard , Hunter . ”
61778	61791	61794	61794	her	58	“ Hunter , oh , God , Hunter . Take me deep . ”
61810	61815	61842	61842	He	57	“ Keep pushing forward . ”
61838	61841	61895	61895	she	58	“ More ! ”
61901	61908	62013	62013	Gretchen	58	“ Oh ! I ’m coming ! ”
62004	62012	62017	62017	her	58	“ Mmm , did you miss me ? ”
62025	62034	62047	62047	Hunter	57	“ It was a long evening without you . ”
62035	62046	62047	62047	Hunter	57	“ I hope you got a lot of work done , ”
62051	62054	62068	62068	he	57	“ Eh . ”
62061	62067	62095	62095	Her	58	“ That ’s too bad , ”
62103	62116	62123	62123	she	58	“ I do n’t plan on letting you get much sleep tonight . ”
62117	62122	62126	62126	her	58	“ Do n’t you ? ”
62135	62141	62151	62151	His	57	“ Are n’t you tired ? ”
62142	62150	62158	62158	he	57	“ Not when I ’m around you . ”
62168	62176	62230	62230	Gretchen	58	“ You bring me back to life . ”
62243	62270	62283	62284	her landlord	976	“ No . I promise . I need my apartment . I really do . I ’m just doing a project on location at the moment . ”
62271	62282	62283	62284	her landlord	976	“ Your rent is one week overdue , Ms. Petty , ”
62290	62299	62311	62311	Gretchen	58	“ And we have n’t seen your check . ”
62300	62310	62311	62311	Gretchen	58	“ What if I give you a check today ? ”
62319	62355	62283	62284	her landlord	976	“ I ’ll call a taxi and head into the city . I ’ll give you a check and I can date it for next week . I should have my contract payment by then . ”
62356	62367	62283	62284	her landlord	976	“ Next week ? Your rent was due last week . ”
62368	62426	62311	62311	Gretchen	58	“ I know ! But I have the payment . I can pay the rest of the entire year with my next check , which should be in any day now . I promise . I can get my agent on the line if you do n’t believe me , and she can confirm the dollar amount . ”
62427	62447	62283	62284	her landlord	976	“ Your contract with us states that rent is due on the first . Not when you get paid . ”
62448	62456	62466	62466	Eldon	84	“ I know . It ’s just — ”
62476	62482	62494	62494	him	84	“ You have a guest . ”
62483	62490	62503	62503	he	84	“ I . . . what ? ”
62498	62502	62503	62503	he	84	“ A guest , ”
62518	62522	62533	62533	she	1096	“ A visitor . ”
62523	62528	62533	62533	she	1096	“ Um , okay . ”
62536	62546	62702	62702	He	84	“ Can I call you back in five minutes ? ”
62692	62701	62726	62726	He	84	“ Cooper , what are you doing here ? ”
62716	62725	62850	62850	he	84	“ Hey , Gretchen . There you are . ”
62781	62848	62867	62867	Gretchen	58	“ Audrey said you were having a hard time with your project . She said you ’re behind on your deadline and was going to bring you a few things to help out . I told her I was n’t busy and I ’d stop by , and I thought I ’d bring you a little care package from the Cuppa while I was at it . ”
62876	62898	62904	62904	He	84	“ You ’re a good friend , Coop . Did you bring me the brownie fudge mocha latte flavoring I love ? ”
62899	62903	62904	62904	He	84	“ Of course . ”
62918	62932	62942	62942	Gretchen	58	“ You look great , by the way . How are you doing ? ”
62933	62941	62942	62942	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m awesome , of course , ”
62950	62964	62974	62974	he	84	“ You want to come hang out in the kitchen for a bit ? ”
62965	62973	62974	62974	he	84	“ I would n’t mind a coffee , ”
62984	62994	62974	62974	he	84	“ Here , let me get that for you . ”
63004	63014	63026	63026	She	58	“ I can carry my own boxes , Coop . ”
63015	63025	63026	63026	She	58	“ Yes , but men carry things for ladies . ”
63029	63042	63050	63050	his	84	“ Who are you and what have you done with my friend ? ”
63054	63063	63128	63128	She	58	“ Fair enough . At least I tried . ”
63138	63144	63149	63149	he	84	“ This is from Audrey ? ”
63158	63178	63186	63186	she	58	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re staying here for an entire month . It ’s like a castle . ”
63179	63185	63186	63186	she	58	“ Oh , I know , ”
63201	63209	63223	63223	he	84	“ Complete with creepy butler and everything . ”
63210	63222	63223	63223	he	84	“ I swear this could be something out of a movie , ”
63229	63254	63263	63263	Cooper	62	“ Do n’t tell me . The owner ’s some Phantom of the Opera – style guy intent on sucking the blood of virgins . ”
63274	63278	63291	63291	she	58	“ You okay ? ”
63279	63290	63363	63363	she	58	“ Just . . . breathed . . . wrong , ”
63369	63380	63397	63397	He	84	“ What did Audrey say she was sending me again ? ”
63381	63396	63397	63397	He	84	“ Stress relievers , I think she said . Something to help things along . ”
63405	63417	63421	63421	he	84	“ She said you ’d know what to do with it . ”
63429	63439	63445	63445	she	58	“ I have a pretty good idea , yeah . ”
63448	63452	63397	63397	He	84	“ Bath salts . ”
63453	63459	63475	63475	she	58	“ Ah . Girl stuff . ”
63460	63465	63475	63475	she	58	“ Definitely girl stuff . ”
63487	63494	63498	63498	She	58	“ I think I smell cookies . ”
63508	63517	63536	63536	She	58	“ Two dozen ? You should n’t have . ”
63518	63535	63536	63536	She	58	“ And some toffee dream bars underneath , just in case you want a little variety . ”
63555	63576	63588	63588	He	84	“ You ’re awesome , Cooper . I ’m sure these cookies are n’t as good as mine , though . ”
63577	63587	63624	63624	he	84	“ They should be . It ’s your recipe . ”
63602	63622	63624	63624	he	84	“ I ’ve missed seeing you , Gretchen . The Cuppa is n’t the same without your smiling face . ”
63654	63659	63624	63624	he	84	“ Cooper . . . ”
63660	63671	63624	63624	he	84	“ I ca n’t stop thinking about you , Gretchen . ”
63672	63675	63687	63687	His	84	“ Cooper — ”
63676	63686	63687	63687	His	84	“ No , please , let me say this . ”
63692	63700	63792	63792	He	84	“ It ’s time I said this . ”
63807	63810	63818	63818	Hunter	57	“ I — ”
63811	63817	63851	63851	her	58	“ Introduce us , Gretchen , ”
63867	63882	63902	63902	Hunter	57	“ Cooper , this is . . . Hunter . He owns Buchanan Manor . ”
63883	63901	63906	63906	Cooper	62	“ Yes . The phantom intent on sucking the blood of virgins , I believe you said , ”
63916	63921	63932	63932	She	58	“ Uh . . . ”
63922	63931	63955	63955	Cooper	62	“ Thanks for bringing the box , Cooper . ”
63961	63973	63989	63989	Hunter	57	“ This is going to be really helpful for my deadline . ”
63974	63988	63989	63989	Hunter	57	“ Of course . Anything you need , I ’m here for you . ”
63996	64013	64014	64014	Gretchen	58	“ You do n’t need to be here for her . I ’m here for her . ”
64026	64034	64046	64046	He	57	“ Since you ’re here , Cooper — ”
64035	64045	64046	64046	He	57	“ Actually , I was just about to leave . ”
64061	64078	64088	64088	Hunter	57	“ Oh , but I was wondering if you could take a check to my landlord — ”
64079	64087	64088	64088	Hunter	57	“ He said he has to go , ”
64092	64104	64105	64105	His	57	“ I ’ll take care of whatever you need , Gretchen . ”
64112	64117	64125	64125	Cooper	62	“ He knows that . ”
64118	64124	64128	64128	He	57	“ I really should go , ”
64134	64141	64193	64193	she	58	“ Eldon will show you out . ”
64180	64192	64208	64208	she	58	“ Thanks again , Cooper . You ’re a good friend , ”
64216	64226	64233	64233	Hunter	57	“ Oh , God , that went really badly . ”
64227	64232	64236	64236	his	57	“ Who was that ? ”
64242	64250	64261	64261	Hunter	57	“ He ’s a friend of mine . ”
64251	64260	64261	64261	Hunter	57	“ He was trying to hit on you , ”
64265	64272	64282	64282	she	58	“ His hand was on yours . ”
64273	64281	64282	64282	she	58	“ Not through any of my doing , ”
64285	64301	64302	64302	She	58	“ I ’ve been trying to figure out a way to let him down easy . ”
64315	64327	64339	64339	She	58	“ Guess I do n’t have to worry about that anymore . ”
64328	64338	64341	64341	her	58	“ You did n’t tell him we were together ? ”
64350	64369	64341	64341	her	58	“ Are we together , Hunter ? You ’ve never said and I did n’t want to presume . ”
64375	64380	64341	64341	her	58	“ We had sex . ”
64381	64407	64411	64411	his	57	“ We had really great sex , Hunter . And I love having sex with you . But it does n’t mean we ’re together . ”
64416	64423	64535	64535	she	58	“ I . . . see . ”
64556	64566	64579	64579	His	57	“ Hunter . That was n’t what I meant . ”
64567	64578	64579	64579	His	57	“ You do n’t have to explain yourself , Gretchen . ”
64586	64592	64632	64632	He	57	“ Spare me your excuses . ”
64593	64631	64640	64640	she	1118	“ I ’m not giving you excuses , you prickly jerk . I ’m trying to tell you that if you do n’t want to be with me , I understand . I ’m not dumping you . ”
64636	64639	64640	64640	she	1118	“ Hunter ! ”
64655	64680	64649	64649	her	1118	“ I like you . I like you a lot . But I did n’t want to assume this was more than it was . ”
64681	64687	64744	64744	Hunter	57	“ You let Cooper assume . ”
64688	64743	64761	64761	he	57	“ Cooper ’s been my friend for years , and he ’s my boss at the coffee shop I occasionally work at . I have to handle him with kid gloves , which is n’t easy when he ’s trying to declare his love every five minutes . I ’m not interested in him . ”
64771	64784	64794	64794	she	1119	“ Answer me truthfully , Gretchen . Are you interested in me ? ”
64785	64793	64880	64880	she	1119	“ Now that ’s a silly question , ”
64870	64879	64880	64880	she	1119	“ I like you more than I should , ”
64884	64940	64993	64993	he	57	“ Someone like you does n’t really belong with someone like me , but I ca n’t seem to stop myself when I ’m with you . I want to kiss you until you ’re blushing , and grab your ass every time I walk past , and do dirty , lascivious things to you . ”
64979	64992	65018	65018	he	57	“ Someone like you is better than what someone like me deserves , ”
65026	65034	65060	65060	Her	1119	“ You should n’t talk like that . ”
65035	65059	65068	65068	she	1119	“ I speak from experience , Gretchen . You ’re the only woman who ’s ever looked at me and not been revolted . ”
65077	65092	65093	65093	He	57	“ Shall I show you just how un - revolted I am by you ? ”
65100	65104	65105	65105	She	1119	“ You should . ”
65117	65126	65131	65131	She	1119	“ Does the door to this room lock ? ”
65127	65130	65131	65131	She	1119	“ No . ”
65143	65157	65170	65170	Kat	77	“ Then you ’d better hope Eldon does n’t walk in on us . ”
65160	65169	65170	65170	Kat	77	“ You ’re never going to believe this . ”
65177	65183	65273	65273	she	58	“ It ’s wicked amazing . ”
65281	65287	65372	65372	Gretchen	58	“ My landlord called you ? ”
65288	65307	65372	65372	Gretchen	58	“ No . Though I did drop off that check . He was kind of pissy about it . ”
65308	65318	65273	65273	she	58	“ We got the payment in for the contract ? ”
65319	65322	65372	65372	Gretchen	58	“ Better . ”
65323	65331	65372	65372	Gretchen	58	“ What ’s better than getting paid ? ”
65332	65351	65372	65372	Gretchen	58	“ You know Astronaut Bill number forty - two ? Astronaut Bill and the Tragedy of Europa IV ? ”
65352	65371	65372	65372	Gretchen	58	“ That was the one with the rampant disease , right ? Yeah , I hated that book . ”
65377	65410	65423	65423	Gretchen	58	“ The cover sucked and they made me write in a plotline where Bill cheats on Uranea because he thought she was dead and they needed sex in at least three chapters . ”
65411	65422	65452	65453	her agent	334	“ It hit the New York Times Best Seller list . ”
65458	65463	65452	65453	her agent	334	“ You ’re joking . ”
65464	65499	65512	65512	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m not joking ! You hit number thirty - four . That ’s the extended New York Times list , which is n’t as great as the main list , but whatever . ”
65500	65511	65512	65512	Gretchen	58	“ But . . . but . . . how ? ”
65517	65538	65552	65552	Kat	77	“ The majority of the sales are through truck stops and subscriptions . I sell hardly anything through retail outlets . ”
65539	65551	65552	65552	Kat	77	“ Well , you sold a shit - ton last week , ”
65556	65610	65615	65615	Gretchen	58	“ The team over at Incomparable Books is absolutely thrilled and they want you to do more Bill books . As many as you can work into your schedule this year . They do n’t even care that you ’re late on this other one . Is n’t that awesome ? Steady work ! ”
65611	65614	65671	65671	Kat	77	“ Great , ”
65624	65670	65671	65671	Kat	77	“ Sales is trying to figure out what the spike in sales came from , but they ’re super pleased . They say that if sales keep going the way they are , they might even add your name as a byline at some point . ”
65675	65687	65692	65692	Gretchen	58	“ Just think . You could write under your own name . ”
65688	65691	65692	65692	Gretchen	58	“ Great , ”
65696	65733	65748	65748	Her	58	“ So how many Bill books do you think you can fit into your schedule this year ? I told them you write fast . At least four , I think . What do you think ? ”
65752	65773	65779	65779	Kat	77	“ I ’m not sure . Let me look at my calendar and I ’ll call you back , okay ? ”
65774	65778	65779	65779	Kat	77	“ Will do , ”
65785	65832	65840	65840	Gretchen	58	“ By the way , I was going to send you flowers but I was n’t sure if it would be apropos since you ’re guesting over there . But I totally thought of flowers for you . I even bought some shoes in your honor . ”
65833	65839	65840	65840	Gretchen	58	“ You ’re so thoughtful , ”
65846	65852	66021	66021	Hunter	57	“ Call you back soon . ”
66035	66038	66039	66039	She	58	“ Gretchen ? ”
66057	66060	66073	66073	he	57	“ Hey . ”
66092	66097	66073	66073	he	57	“ You ’re upset . ”
66098	66103	66124	66124	She	58	“ It ’s nothing . ”
66104	66123	66145	66145	He	57	“ I do n’t like seeing you upset . Tell me what it is that ’s bothering you . ”
66137	66144	66149	66149	he	57	“ I ’m fine . Really . ”
66155	66163	66192	66192	she	58	“ Is it something I can fix ? ”
66200	66229	66237	66237	Hunter	57	“ I ’m not entirely sure I understand why I ’m upset , myself . So no , I ca n’t ask you to help me fix it . ”
66230	66236	66244	66244	she	58	“ A distraction , then ? ”
66240	66243	66244	66244	she	58	“ Hmmm , ”
66249	66269	66294	66294	She	58	“ Now that has merit . What did you have in mind ? What do you do to relax ? ”
66270	66293	66294	66294	She	58	“ I do n’t know if you want to do what I do . I usually exercise or work in my greenhouse . ”
66299	66314	66331	66331	He	57	“ Yeah , that does n’t exactly sound like fun to me . Sorry . ”
66315	66330	66462	66462	his	57	“ I think you ’re not giving it a fair chance . Come on . ”
66472	66482	66462	66462	his	57	“ Are we here to pick me another rose ? ”
66483	66486	66462	66462	his	57	“ Better . ”
66487	66496	66501	66501	he	57	“ Two roses ? You rebel , you . ”
66497	66500	66501	66501	he	57	“ Better , ”
66505	66512	66513	66513	She	58	“ Which roses are your favorites ? ”
66521	66528	66540	66540	She	58	“ The ones you give me . ”
66529	66539	66540	66540	She	58	“ Do you like a particular color ? Scent ? ”
66546	66559	66565	66565	Gretchen	58	“ I liked the blue one you gave me the first day . ”
66560	66564	66601	66601	He	57	“ What else ? ”
66607	66614	66620	66620	He	57	“ Which one is your favorite ? ”
66615	66619	66620	66620	He	57	“ For you ? ”
66642	66661	66673	66673	she	58	“ This one . Papa Meilland . It makes me think of you every time I see it . ”
66681	66684	66712	66712	She	58	“ Why ? ”
66685	66711	66712	66712	She	58	“ The petals are like velvet , the color a deep red like your hair , and no other rose that I own smells sweeter . ”
66717	66723	66738	66738	She	58	“ All very good reasons . ”
66724	66737	66738	66738	She	58	“ It ’s also one of the more difficult ones to grow . ”
66741	66747	66787	66787	He	57	“ You calling me difficult ? ”
66748	66786	66787	66787	He	57	“ It ’s a fragile flower . It looks beautiful and hardy , but even the smallest of ailments can bring it down . It reminds me that some things require a bit more thought and care . ”
66802	66818	66787	66787	He	57	“ It ’s a challenge , but there is no rose sweeter when it blossoms . ”
66819	66836	66843	66843	he	57	“ That ’s beautiful , Hunter . Who knew you would get so poetic over flowers ? ”
66837	66842	66843	66843	he	57	“ Not the roses , ”
66859	66869	66787	66787	He	57	“ So what did you want to show me ? ”
66870	66881	66897	66897	He	57	“ One of my passions is the hybridization of roses . ”
66882	66896	66897	66897	He	57	“ Wow . Sounds . . . um , boring . I think . ”
66924	66943	66957	66957	He	57	“ I wanted to choose something you ’d like . I ’d like to create you a rose . ”
66950	66956	67041	67041	he	57	“ Create me a rose ? ”
67037	67040	67041	67041	he	57	“ Hybridization , ”
67065	67117	67128	67128	Gretchen	58	“ Is how all the different varieties of hybrid tea roses are created . They ’ve been bred and crossbred with each other for the best qualities — long stems , bright colors , lovely scents . I ’d like to see if I can cross a rose just for you . ”
67118	67127	67143	67143	He	57	“ I ’m always game for a present , ”
67131	67142	67156	67156	he	57	“ So when do I get to see my rose ? ”
67166	67209	67227	67227	he	57	“ These things take time . It ’s a slow process of pollination and experimentation . I ’ll have to take one of the Blue Girl roses — that ’s the one you liked — that ’s budding and force it open — ”
67210	67222	67227	67227	he	57	“ Pollination , experimentation , and forcing petals ? Sounds kinky . ”
67250	67277	67285	67285	He	57	“ You do that to prepare it for pollination from the other rose . They ’re covered to prevent them from being pollinated from another rose . ”
67278	67284	67308	67308	him	57	“ Rose condoms . Gotcha . ”
67314	67320	67367	67367	He	57	“ Do you always interrupt ? ”
67321	67332	67367	67367	He	57	“ Yes . But do n’t let that stop you . ”
67333	67345	67350	67350	she	58	“ I wo n’t . Do you want to hear more ? ”
67346	67349	67350	67350	she	58	“ Absolutely , ”
67353	67366	67367	67367	He	57	“ This is as dirty as those letters I ’ve been reading . ”
67382	67435	67440	67440	she	58	“ We want the Papa Meilland to bloom and mature . Once it has , we take the pollen from the Papa Meilland and transfer it to the Blue Girl . We let the Blue Girl go to seed , collect those , and plant them to see what we ’ve created . ”
67436	67439	67440	67440	she	58	“ Hmm , ”
67452	67463	67367	67367	He	57	“ This is n’t a fast hobby , is it . ”
67464	67471	67485	67485	he	57	“ I ’m a patient man . ”
67472	67482	67587	67587	his	57	“ You think long term , do n’t you ? ”
67592	67604	67615	67615	She	58	“ I love you , Gretchen . Do n’t be sad . ”
67623	67638	67646	67646	His	57	“ Hunter , I . . . I do n’t know what to say . ”
67639	67645	67661	67661	he	57	“ Do n’t say anything . ”
67669	67740	67769	67769	he	1136	“ I ’ve never met anyone like you . If I live to be a hundred , I ’ll never feel as deeply for anyone as I feel for you right now . You bring light and sunshine to my life . I ’m not telling you that I love you to make you unhappy . I ’m telling you thank you . Thank you for coming into my life . ”
67760	67768	67769	67769	he	1136	“ Do n’t say anything , Gretchen , ”
67772	67839	67840	67840	She	1135	“ I ’m a practical man . I never thought to have a woman in my life , ever . I thought my face would turn off any woman worth having . I never thought I would be lucky enough to meet someone like you . I have no illusions as to what this means to you , but for me , it is the world . ”
67849	67858	67863	67863	he	1136	“ Sounds like fate ’s brought us together . ”
67859	67862	67867	67867	his	1136	“ Yes , ”
67873	67876	68687	68687	She	58	“ Fate . ”
68670	68686	68765	68765	she	58	“ Hell , Igor . Now I ’ve gone all moony , have n’t I ? ”
68751	68764	69279	69279	She	58	“ You just tell me if I ’m being ridiculous , cat , ”
69275	69278	69369	69369	Hunter	57	“ Enter . ”
69364	69368	69369	69369	Hunter	57	“ Finished working ? ”
69375	69380	69387	69387	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s early . ”
69381	69386	69401	69401	She	58	“ Just momentarily distracted , ”
69417	69423	69428	69428	he	57	“ Am I bothering you ? ”
69424	69427	69432	69432	His	57	“ Yes , ”
69444	69452	69453	69453	She	58	“ But I do n’t mind it . ”
69473	69484	69499	69499	his	57	“ You ’re going to make me forget my mission . ”
69485	69488	69493	69493	She	58	“ Mission ? ”
69489	69492	69493	69493	She	58	“ Mmmhmm . ”
69515	69524	69559	69559	She	58	“ I ’m looking for a secret passage . ”
69525	69530	69540	69540	she	58	“ Is that so ? ”
69531	69539	69559	69559	She	58	“ It ’s mentioned in the letters , ”
69572	69582	69583	69583	Hunter	57	“ Where are the other libraries in the house ? ”
69588	69595	69601	69601	she	58	“ There ’s no secret passage . ”
69596	69600	69601	69601	she	58	“ There is , ”
69613	69657	69601	69601	she	58	“ I swear I ’m not lying . They go on and on about it in the letters . I thought it would be terrific to see . We could take pictures of it and add some excitement and reality to the book . ”
69662	69669	69682	69682	He	57	“ There ’s no secret passage . ”
69670	69681	69701	69701	He	57	“ Of course there is . Just look at this . ”
69713	69723	69728	69728	He	57	“ Wow , what ’s crawled into your panties ? ”
69724	69727	69728	69728	He	57	“ Nothing . ”
69733	69739	69753	69753	She	58	“ I ’m just tired . ”
69740	69752	69762	69762	her	58	“ Then will you quit acting like I ’m bothering you ? ”
69770	69781	69809	69809	he	57	“ I do n’t know what the big deal is . ”
69802	69808	69809	69809	he	57	“ You never bother me , ”
69813	69825	69837	69837	her	58	“ My day is better every time I see your face . ”
69844	69853	69854	69854	He	57	“ Then help me find this secret passage . ”
69864	69895	69896	69896	He	57	“ The house underwent many renovations over the last fifty years . The main library was destroyed . If there was a secret room , it ’s there no longer . ”
69913	69924	69966	69966	he	57	“ I ’m sorry . I know it ’s disappointing . ”
69925	69928	69929	69929	Gretchen	58	“ Oh . ”
69937	69960	69966	69966	he	57	“ That ’s a shame . I was hoping to see it . I ’m sorry to have bothered you , then . ”
69978	69992	69966	69966	he	57	“ Gretchen , you are never a bother . I ’m just distracted . ”
69993	69997	70007	70007	She	58	“ By what ? ”
69998	70006	70007	70007	She	58	“ Work . . . and you . ”
70015	70029	70030	70030	He	57	“ Well , if I ’m bothering you , I ’ll just go . ”
70042	70061	70007	70007	She	58	“ No you do n’t . Now that you have my attention , you ’re not going anywhere . ”
70062	70067	70073	70073	His	57	“ Is that so ? ”
70068	70072	70098	70098	She	58	“ It is . ”
70086	70097	70098	70098	She	58	“ I ca n’t help myself . You look ravishing . ”
70101	70113	70007	70007	She	58	“ I ’m wearing a T - shirt and yoga pants . ”
70114	70119	70162	70162	his	57	“ You always do . ”
70120	70131	70162	70162	his	57	“ Now is that some slight upon my wardrobe choices ? ”
70132	70153	70216	70216	She	58	“ No , that ’s me telling you that I find you impossible to resist every time I see you . ”
70231	70240	70209	70209	her	58	“ So there ’s no more secret passage ? ”
70241	70244	70258	70258	she	58	“ Nope . ”
70245	70257	70268	70268	he	57	“ Then it seems like I came in here for nothing , ”
70262	70267	70258	70258	she	58	“ Not for nothing , ”
70271	70281	70209	70209	her	58	“ I think I have something to show you . ”
70282	70285	70209	70209	her	58	“ Oh ? ”
70286	70302	70258	70258	she	58	“ In my room . Perhaps you ’d like to search it for secret passages . ”
70303	70315	70320	70320	he	57	“ What are the odds of me finding one in there ? ”
70316	70319	70320	70320	he	57	“ Slim , ”
70334	70342	70352	70352	She	58	“ But there ’s always that chance . ”
70343	70351	70671	70671	Hunter	57	“ Sounds like my kind of party . ”
70661	70670	70671	70671	Hunter	57	“ You called for me , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
70680	70693	70671	70671	Hunter	57	“ You did n’t read these before purchasing them , did you . ”
70700	70722	70731	70731	Hunter	57	“ I did not . I procured them as you wished , but my instructions never included reading the letters myself . ”
70723	70730	70731	70731	Hunter	57	“ They mention a secret room . ”
70746	70754	70769	70769	His	84	“ Gretchen came here looking for it . ”
70778	70785	70786	70786	Hunter	57	“ This letter is quite vulgar . ”
70799	70813	70819	70819	he	84	“ They ’re all quite vulgar , or did n’t you know that ? ”
70824	70867	70873	70873	he	84	“ This is supposed to be a very innocent batch of letters , Eldon . From Buchanan Manor . Not some other nameless house with secret doors and libraries . If she finds out this is a fraud , she ’ll leave . ”
70878	70890	70899	70899	Eldon	84	“ I do n’t want her leaving here . Leaving me . ”
70891	70898	70920	70920	He	84	“ She ’s not a dog , ”
70906	70919	70920	70920	He	84	“ She ’s allowed to leave your property on her own wishes . ”
70927	70944	70952	70952	He	84	“ You know what I mean . I want her here for as long as possible . ”
70962	70976	70977	70977	Hunter	57	“ You do realize she ’s almost done with the project , Buchanan ? ”
70982	70999	71024	71024	His	57	“ I thought she was here for a full month . How long has it been ? ”
71000	71023	71059	71059	He	57	“ A little over three weeks . And she ’s nearly done with the trunk . She ’ll be leaving very soon . ”
71049	71054	71059	71059	He	57	“ I . . . ”
71064	71068	71069	71069	Eldon	84	“ Fix this . ”
71082	71094	71059	71059	He	57	“ Fix this ? Or fix the part about her leaving ? ”
71095	71101	71116	71116	Hunter	57	“ Yes . To both . ”
71102	71115	71116	71116	Hunter	57	“ Very well . Shall I shackle her left leg or right ? ”
71121	71127	71142	71142	Hunter	57	“ That ’s not funny . ”
71128	71141	71142	71142	Hunter	57	“ What do you suggest I do to prevent her from leaving ? ”
71151	71182	71188	71188	Eldon	84	“ I do n’t know . Just think of something . She needs to stay longer . I ’m not ready for her to leave my side . Not yet . ”
71183	71187	71188	71188	Eldon	84	“ I see . ”
71199	71208	71214	71214	Hunter	57	“ I shall see what I can do . ”
71209	71213	71214	71214	Hunter	57	“ Thank you , ”
71218	71233	71240	71240	Eldon	84	“ Do this for me and I ’ll see that you ’re well compensated . ”
71234	71239	71248	71248	He	84	“ You always do , ”
71262	71279	71298	71298	his	57	“ You seem troubled , Mr. Buchanan . Would you like to . . . talk ? ”
71301	71306	71332	71332	He	84	“ I ’m fine . ”
71307	71323	71332	71332	He	84	“ You do n’t seem fine , if you do n’t mind me saying so . ”
71324	71331	71332	71332	He	84	“ I ’m not , actually . ”
71342	71352	71353	71353	He	84	“ But I will be once you fix that . ”
71368	71382	71388	71388	Eldon	84	“ I ’m heading back to bed , Eldon . Get some sleep . ”
71383	71387	71607	71607	He	84	“ Of course , ”
71616	71627	71633	71633	she	58	“ Come back to bed . It ’s too early . ”
71628	71632	71681	71681	He	84	“ Ca n’t , ”
71665	71680	71681	71681	He	84	“ Nice try , but I ’ve got a lot of work to do . ”
71687	71691	71692	71692	She	58	“ Come back . ”
71696	71716	71771	71771	he	84	“ Nope . Ca n’t . You sleep , though . You were up too late last night working . ”
71761	71770	72030	72030	Igor	79	“ I ’ll get up in a minute , ”
72040	72054	72055	72055	She	58	“ Oh , no . Did I leave you in here all night ? ”
72069	72105	72187	72187	She	58	“ I ’ve been neglecting you shamefully , have n’t I ? I ca n’t help it . I ’ve got a new man in my life and he does n’t even need kitty litter . ”
72179	72186	72798	72798	She	58	“ No , no , no ! ”
72794	72797	72809	72809	her	58	“ Gretchen ? ”
72815	72832	72878	72878	he	57	“ Oh . Hi . Sorry . I was just , um . . . working . ”
72870	72877	72938	72938	she	58	“ Tell me what ’s wrong , ”
72933	72937	72938	72938	she	58	“ My book , ”
72944	72949	72972	72972	he	57	“ It ’s gone . ”
72968	72971	72972	72972	he	57	“ Gone ? ”
72978	72982	72993	72993	she	58	“ What happened ? ”
72983	72992	72993	72993	she	58	“ Igor must have knocked over the vase , ”
73003	73013	73021	73021	Hunter	57	“ The laptop is soaked . It ’s ruined . ”
73026	73044	73047	73047	her	58	“ We ’ll fix it . I ’ll call someone to come take a look at it . ”
73059	73078	73085	73085	he	57	“ It ’s my fault . I left Igor in here all night . I ’m so stupid . ”
73079	73084	73100	73100	He	57	“ You are not , ”
73111	73123	73135	73135	she	58	“ You ’re not stupid , Gretchen . Not by far . ”
73124	73134	73135	73135	she	58	“ I should have emailed my backups to Kat , ”
73139	73145	73146	73146	She	58	“ I just . . . ”
73149	73154	73155	73155	She	58	“ You just what ? ”
73162	73198	73267	73267	he	57	“ The more I work , the less I seem to enjoy it . That ’s all . I guess I ’ve been avoiding Kat . Talking with her just feels like too much pressure . ”
73260	73266	73267	73267	he	57	“ We ’ll fix this , ”
73275	73289	73296	73296	she	58	“ Give me your laptop . I ’ll send it off with Eldon . ”
73290	73295	73313	73313	He	57	“ O - okay , ”
73326	73368	73313	73313	He	57	“ I ’m going to send this off with him and instruct the technicians to not come back until they ’ve recovered your files . But for the rest of the day , we ’re going to relax and enjoy ourselves . ”
73369	73377	73404	73404	She	58	“ I do n’t think I can . ”
73378	73403	73404	73404	She	58	“ Oh , you can . And we ’re not going to think about work . We ’re just going to enjoy each other . ”
73411	73422	73523	73523	Hunter	57	“ What if I have to start over , Hunter ? ”
73528	73534	73542	73542	she	58	“ I ’ll be back . ”
73535	73541	73654	73654	Hunter	57	“ I ’ll be here , ”
73661	73668	73690	73690	Hunter	57	“ Your work , I assume ? ”
73684	73689	73694	73694	He	57	“ She ’s crying , ”
73699	73707	73716	73716	Eldon	84	“ I did n’t want her upset . ”
73708	73715	73742	73742	He	84	“ You said to fix it , ”
73723	73741	73742	73742	He	84	“ You did n’t say how . You needed her work to continue to keep her here . ”
73748	73759	73818	73818	He	57	“ I have ensured that , just as you asked . ”
73802	73817	73826	73826	himself	57	“ Take the laptop to a technician . See if they can fix it . ”
73830	73837	73847	73847	Eldon	84	“ Not too soon , though . ”
73838	73846	73847	73847	Eldon	84	“ I shall escort it in myself , ”
73854	73878	73826	73826	himself	57	“ I am sure that no one will get to it for at least a week , no matter how much I ask . ”
73879	73882	73893	73893	He	57	“ Good . ”
73883	73892	73911	73911	Gretchen	58	“ And if the file can be recovered ? ”
73924	73939	73945	73945	Eldon	84	“ I . . . I ’ll cross that bridge when I get there . ”
73940	73944	73945	73945	Eldon	84	“ Very well , ”
73952	73968	73974	73974	Eldon	84	“ Cancel my meetings today . I ’m going to spend the day with Gretchen . ”
73969	73973	74060	74060	She	58	“ Very well , ”
74085	74117	74122	74122	he	57	“ I think I can come up with a system of some kind . Not all of the letters are important , so if I make a pile of the ones — ”
74118	74121	74136	74136	He	57	“ No , ”
74156	74166	74173	74173	She	58	“ Today , we ’re taking the day off . ”
74167	74172	74173	74173	She	58	“ I ca n’t . ”
74194	74222	74223	74223	He	57	“ If I have to recreate the document , I need to get started right away . I ca n’t afford to lose any time . I — ”
74236	74268	74279	74279	her	58	“ Gretchen , you work every day . Even on weekends . You can take a day off . When was the last time you had a day off from writing ? ”
74282	74288	74308	74308	He	57	“ I ’m not sure . ”
74289	74307	74308	74308	He	57	“ You ’re stressed and you ’re unhappy . I do n’t like seeing you like this . ”
74321	74339	74354	74354	her	58	“ Take a day off . I ’ve cancelled all my meetings . We can just relax . ”
74340	74345	74354	74354	her	58	“ But my projects — ”
74346	74352	74358	74358	he	57	“ Can wait one day . ”
74366	74388	74399	74399	Gretchen	58	“ You can call your agent in the morning and explain what happened and tell her you need a deadline extension . ”
74389	74398	74591	74591	her	58	“ She ’s not going to be happy . ”
74598	74617	74627	74627	She	58	“ I think that was me . I guess I got so distracted that I did n’t eat . ”
74618	74626	74627	74627	She	58	“ Shall I have Eldon prepare something ? ”
74632	74664	74682	74682	he	1214	“ I ’m a much better cook than he is . You have n’t tried my three - cheese omelet yet , have you ? It ’ll make you a believer . ”
74671	74681	74682	74682	he	1214	“ I ’m willing to give it a try , ”
74696	74707	74717	74717	she	58	“ But I ’m not a big fan of eggs . ”
74708	74716	74737	74737	He	1214	“ I ’ll make you a fan , ”
74725	74736	74737	74737	He	1214	“ Come on . I ’ll make you a treat . ”
74748	74768	74771	74771	her	58	“ Today ’s about your day of rest , Gretchen . I do n’t want you waiting on me . ”
74782	74800	74959	74959	She	58	“ Cooking ’s not a chore , silly . It ’s fun . Now , come on . ”
74921	74958	74967	74967	her	58	“ I swear , Eldon lets most of this food go to waste . I ’m going to make some muffins for the cleaning crew . It seems a shame not to use up these groceries . ”
74972	74981	75000	75000	She	58	“ This is lame , is n’t it ? ”
74993	74999	75000	75000	She	58	“ What do you mean ? ”
75011	75027	75000	75000	She	58	“ Me . Cooking . You think it ’s stupid and you ’re probably bored . ”
75028	75033	75067	75067	She	58	“ Not at all . ”
75054	75066	75067	75067	She	58	“ I like watching you work . I do n’t mind . ”
75090	75103	75116	75116	he	1214	“ That ’s funny . You never want to watch me write . ”
75104	75115	75116	75116	he	1214	“ You do n’t look as happy when you write , ”
75135	75141	75183	75183	She	58	“ You look happy now . ”
75160	75182	75183	75183	She	58	“ Writing ’s my job . I do n’t do it because I love it . It just pays the bills . ”
75206	75238	75263	75263	her	58	“ I thought when I first started that writing would be an amazing job . Spend all day in your pajamas and no one to answer to but yourself , right ? ”
75239	75243	75325	75325	She	58	“ I suppose . ”
75278	75324	75325	75325	She	58	“ Yeah , well , I get to spend all day in my pajamas , but it seems like I have more bosses and deadlines than ever before . And I ’m not crazy about the work . Like . . . not at all . ”
75346	75363	75386	75386	she	58	“ I kind of hate it , actually . Fucking astronauts and their stupid bimbo girlfriends . ”
75364	75371	75386	75386	she	58	“ What are you talking about ? ”
75372	75380	75443	75443	Gretchen	58	“ You know . My ghostwriting work . ”
75430	75442	75443	75443	Gretchen	58	“ So what would you do if you could do anything ? ”
75449	75457	75723	75723	her	58	“ Be right here ? With you ? ”
75734	75739	75865	75865	Her	58	“ Want to taste ? ”
75845	75864	75865	75865	Her	58	“ Is it too early in the day to throw you down on the floor and fuck you ? ”
75874	75883	75890	75890	he	57	“ God , no . Never too early . ”
75884	75889	75972	75972	she	58	“ Then come here , ”
75987	76001	76011	76011	he	57	“ It does n’t take much to get you going , does it ? ”
76002	76010	76049	76049	her	58	“ Not when it comes to you , ”
76057	76066	76077	76077	he	57	“ Oh , Hunter , that feels amazing . ”
76067	76076	76077	76077	he	57	“ I want to make you feel good , ”
76090	76097	76108	76108	Her	58	“ Tell me what you want . ”
76098	76107	76131	76131	He	57	“ Sex . Right here , right now . ”
76144	76151	76152	76152	She	58	“ Yes . God , yes . ”
76158	76178	76197	76197	she	58	“ Wait . What about the staff ? What if they see us ? Maybe we should hide somewhere . ”
76201	76208	76197	76197	she	58	“ We need condoms , too . ”
76224	76234	76250	76250	she	58	“ Fine . We ’ll go to your room . ”
76235	76249	76250	76250	she	58	“ So far away ? It ’s an entire hall or two down , ”
76253	76265	76266	76266	He	57	“ I do n’t know if I can walk that far . ”
76279	76286	76317	76317	Hunter	57	“ Then I ’ll carry you . ”
76307	76316	76317	76317	Hunter	57	“ I was joking . I can walk . ”
76332	76340	76368	76368	He	57	“ But I like to carry you . ”
76360	76367	76554	76554	she	58	“ I ’m out of objections . ”

76613	76621	76660	76660	she	58	“ I want you deep inside me . ”
76656	76659	76660	76660	she	58	“ Mmm , ”
76668	76683	76684	76684	He	57	“ I liked it when you held me . Felt so close to you . ”
76695	76724	76725	76725	She	58	“ We do n’t have to stop . We can make love like that , with me holding you . I just need to get a condom on . ”
76748	76755	76762	76762	He	57	“ I ’m not too heavy ? ”
76756	76761	76762	76762	He	57	“ Not at all . ”
76780	76786	76791	76791	she	58	“ Shall I show you ? ”
76787	76790	76966	76966	He	57	“ Absolutely , ”
76950	76965	76968	76968	his	57	“ You taste so sweet , Gretchen . Sweeter than anything I ’ve tasted . ”
76981	76990	76998	76998	Her	58	“ I ca n’t get enough of you . ”
76991	76997	76998	76998	Her	58	“ Then do n’t stop . ”
77015	77025	77033	77033	he	57	“ Oh , God , do n’t ever stop . ”
77026	77032	77054	77054	She	58	“ But you ’ll come , ”
77072	77078	77089	77089	he	57	“ Why are you stopping ? ”
77079	77088	77089	77089	he	57	“ Because I need to be inside you , ”
77098	77102	77135	77135	he	57	“ Right now . ”
77126	77134	77212	77212	Gretchen	58	“ Put your arms around my neck , ”
77208	77211	77212	77212	Gretchen	58	“ Oh , ”
77215	77221	77298	77298	She	58	“ You ’re so deep . ”
77293	77297	77313	77313	her	58	“ Feel good ? ”
77327	77337	77342	77342	He	57	“ Oh , Hunter , do n’t drop me . ”
77338	77341	77354	77354	Her	58	“ Never . ”
77362	77370	77398	77398	He	57	“ I wo n’t let you go . ”
77392	77397	77446	77446	she	58	“ Harder , Hunter . ”
77440	77445	77499	77499	her	58	“ What . . . ”
77509	77516	77628	77628	she	58	“ Oh ! Just like that ! ”
77624	77627	77637	77637	he	57	“ Hunter , ”
77631	77636	77637	77637	he	57	“ I ’m here , ”
77653	77659	78133	78133	Hunter	57	“ I ’ve got you . ”
78124	78132	78149	78149	She	58	“ We could have had this catered , ”
78168	78197	78802	78802	Hunter	57	“ How many times do I have to tell you ? I like cooking . Besides , this is only ten additional people . I can handle that . ”
78790	78801	78802	78802	Hunter	57	“ What time did we ask everyone to get here ? ”
78805	78819	78802	78802	Hunter	57	“ It should n’t matter . It ’s just a gathering of friends . ”
78826	78834	78850	78850	herself	58	“ Poor baby . Are you nervous ? ”
78860	78870	78875	78875	he	57	“ You should n’t be . You look amazing . ”
78880	78897	78902	78902	She	58	“ You ’re the one no one will be able to take their eyes off of . ”
78898	78901	79003	79003	He	57	“ Flatterer . ”
78984	79002	79003	79003	He	57	“ With that glib tongue , I think you ’ll do just fine at this party tonight . ”
79010	79024	79032	79032	He	57	“ Not so sure about that . You know I do n’t entertain . ”
79025	79031	79032	79032	He	57	“ Not even your friends ? ”
79037	79045	79085	79085	she	58	“ I ’ve never invited them here . ”
79069	79083	79137	79137	Someone	1826	“ Well , I ’m here tonight . You let me handle everything . ”
79143	79160	79266	79266	His	189	“ Dinner and a show . You really know how to treat your guests , Hunter . ”
79273	79283	79317	79317	she	58	“ Come . Let me introduce you to Reese . ”
79309	79316	79317	79317	she	58	“ You ’re our first guest , ”
79321	79331	79345	79345	He	189	“ You must be one of Hunter ’s friends . ”
79332	79344	79345	79345	He	189	“ I am . You must be Hunter ’s new ladylove . ”
79360	79366	79345	79345	He	189	“ I applaud his taste . ”
79367	79370	79385	79385	Reese	109	“ Thanks . ”
79371	79384	79395	79395	She	58	“ I do hope Hunter does n’t monopolize you the entire evening , ”
79407	79422	79432	79432	Hunter	57	“ Cool your jets , lover boy . I ’m not into dual penetration . ”
79434	79442	79685	79685	She	58	“ I see why you like her . ”
79672	79684	79685	79685	She	58	“ I ’m so pleased that you ’re here , Gretchen . ”
79692	79700	79731	79731	She	58	“ A bad Petty always turns up . ”
79715	79730	79731	79731	She	58	“ Look at you . Gorgeous . Not an ounce of bad in you . ”
79739	79750	79759	79759	Cade	65	“ I did n’t know you were friends with Cade . ”
79751	79758	79778	79778	she	58	“ We go back to college , ”
79767	79777	79808	79808	Hunter	57	“ Not nearly as far back as we do , ”
79796	79807	79831	79831	Gretchen	58	“ I see I do n’t need to give introductions , ”
79815	79830	79878	79878	She	58	“ You can , if it ’ll stop Cade from giving me a noogie , ”
79843	79877	79926	79926	she	58	“ I have n’t given a girl a noogie ever since I discovered they do n’t have cooties , Gretchen . I think we ’ve missed out on a few years in between . ”
79888	79925	79950	79950	He	57	“ Cade grew up on the same street as I did . The twins , Cade , and I were the only children in the neighborhood , so we tended to play together quite a bit , ”
79936	79949	79950	79950	He	57	“ You know Audrey ’s going to be here tonight , too . ”
79953	79977	80022	80023	Another pair	1289	“ I ’m not surprised . She ’s Logan ’s assistant , correct ? Sometimes she shows up at these sorts of functions . ”
80006	80021	80241	80241	Eldon	84	“ That ’s right . I ’m sure she ’d love to catch up . ”
80259	80284	80295	80295	She	58	“ Your sister is here , Ms. Petty . And she has brought a . . . problem . Could you please follow me ? ”
80290	80294	80321	80321	She	58	“ Of course . ”
80331	80337	80346	80346	Eldon	84	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
80338	80345	80346	80346	Eldon	84	“ Follow me , Ms. Petty , ”
80353	80359	80539	80539	she	70	“ You ’ll soon see . ”
80532	80538	80539	80539	she	70	“ Oh , hey sis , ”
80542	80556	80568	80568	Audrey	56	“ Heard you were having a party and thought I ’d crash it . ”
80559	80567	80568	80568	Audrey	56	“ I ’m so sorry , Gretchen , ”
80585	80599	80606	80606	Gretchen	58	“ She showed up earlier today and I could n’t leave her alone . ”
80600	80605	80606	80606	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s okay , ”
80617	80627	80632	80632	Daphne	70	“ Hey , Daph . How ’s it going ? ”
80628	80631	80689	80689	She	70	“ Greaaat , ”
80700	80716	80727	80727	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m avoiding my manager . He ’s trying to take my money again . ”
80717	80726	80727	80727	Gretchen	58	“ You mean put you on an allowance ? ”
80738	80748	80760	80760	Eldon	84	“ Can we add another seat to the party ? ”
80749	80759	80791	80791	Daphne	70	“ Are you sure you want to do that ? ”
80784	80790	80800	80800	her	70	“ ’ Course she does , ”
80807	80821	80839	80839	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m the entertainment . Do n’t you know who I am ? ”
80822	80838	80850	80850	Audrey	56	“ He does n’t care who you are , and you ’re not the entertainment , ”
80843	80849	80850	80850	Audrey	56	“ I ’m really sorry , ”
80857	80882	80800	80800	her	70	“ I did n’t know what else to do . Should we leave her in a room somewhere to let her sleep it off ? ”
80883	80894	80850	80850	Audrey	56	“ Can we trust her not to steal the silver ? ”
80895	80900	80916	80916	Gretchen	58	“ Um , no . ”
80901	80915	80916	80916	Gretchen	58	“ Then no , we ca n’t . This is Hunter ’s house . ”
80919	80942	80986	80986	Gretchen	58	“ Come on . Let ’s introduce my junkie sister to my boyfriend and my new editor . This ’ll be fun . ”
80969	80985	81015	81015	Kat	77	“ Hi , everyone . This is my sister Audrey and her twin , Daphne . ”
81025	81036	81015	81015	Kat	77	“ Oh , my God . Is that . . . ”
81043	81055	81067	81069	The editorial assistant	1323	“ You ’re Daphne Petty ’s sister ? The Daphne Petty ? ”
81056	81066	81067	81069	The editorial assistant	1323	“ Daphne ! I am such a big fan . ”
81081	81101	81110	81110	Daphne	70	“ I loved your first album . I even saw you on tour in 2010 with the Lipstick Project . ”
81102	81109	81198	81198	She	58	“ Yeah , that was me , ”
81135	81197	81198	81198	She	58	“ They sucked , did n’t they ? That fucking tour was a nightmare . Hated every moment of it . Could n’t wait to get backstage and get loaded every night , just to get through the goddamn day . The drugs were the only thing that made it worth it . Shit , they had some fine ass drugs . ”
81207	81220	81232	81232	she	1323	“ You do n’t have any drugs on you , do you ? ”
81221	81224	81243	81243	Gretchen	58	“ Um . ”
81239	81242	81256	81256	Daphne	70	“ Daph , ”
81250	81255	81269	81269	Audrey	56	“ Oooh , wine , ”
81264	81268	81295	81295	Kat	77	“ No wine ! ”
81277	81294	81295	81295	Kat	77	“ I ca n’t believe you did n’t tell me that Daphne Petty was your sister , ”
81300	81331	81338	81338	Gretchen	58	“ She is a gold mine of Hollywood gossip . Do you think she ’d let us do an autobiography ? We could sell it . We ’re talking millions . ”
81332	81337	81338	81338	Gretchen	58	“ No , Kat , ”
81350	81364	81371	81371	Kat	77	“ She ’s not interested and neither am I. Her life is private . ”
81365	81370	81371	81371	Kat	77	“ Not that private , ”
81375	81418	81419	81419	Gretchen	58	“ She ’s in the tabloids every week . Is it true that her manager has her on a strict allowance ? Is it true that she slept with Thomas Steele and aborted his baby ? That her label assigns her handlers ? ”
81426	81440	81448	81448	she	77	“ I ’m serious . Drop it . Daphne ’s off the table . ”
81453	81486	81580	81580	Gretchen	58	“ I ’m just saying . You know where to go if she ever needs an influx of cash . Which , according to Star Trax magazine , is any day now . ”
81545	81579	81624	81624	Brontë	59	“ I hate to break in to the conversation , ladies , but dinner ’s going to be served in a few minutes . Gretchen , where do you want to seat Daphne ? ”
81600	81623	81666	81666	Hunter	57	“ Put her on the far end of the table . Let ’s make sure nothing but water gets close to Daphne . ”
81659	81665	81677	81677	his	57	“ Is everything all right ? ”
81685	81690	81696	81696	she	58	“ You look unhappy . ”
81691	81695	81696	81696	she	58	“ Just surprised , ”
81701	81716	81677	81677	his	57	“ Though I should n’t be . Daphne just brings trouble wherever she goes . ”
81717	81730	81735	81735	Gretchen	58	“ Do you want me to have her escorted off the premises ? ”
81731	81734	81735	81735	Gretchen	58	“ No . ”
81740	81758	81837	81837	Daphne	70	“ Let ’s just try and ignore her through dinner . I think Brontë has her handled . ”
81833	81836	81847	81847	She	70	“ Wait , ”
81840	81846	81881	81881	Daphne	70	“ Where ’s my sister ? ”
81874	81880	81884	81884	She	70	“ Oh , my God , ”
81893	81900	81936	81936	Hunter	57	“ That dude is fucking hideous . ”
81942	81955	81981	81981	Daphne	70	“ Daphne , this is my . . . boyfriend , Hunter . ”
81990	81999	82012	82012	Daphne	70	“ He ’s like a bad acid trip . ”
82000	82011	82012	82012	Daphne	70	“ Daph ! Stop it ! You ’re embarrassing me . ”
82015	82026	82033	82033	Gretchen	58	“ Me ? What about Quasimodo at your side there ? ”
82027	82032	82039	82039	She	58	“ That ’s enough , ”
82053	82089	82099	82099	Audrey	56	“ I do n’t care if you ’re my sister . If you ca n’t be polite , you ’re out of here . I ’m going to call your manager and rat you out . ”
82090	82098	82099	82099	Audrey	56	“ Daphne , please just be quiet , ”
82108	82111	82112	82112	Daphne	70	“ Please . ”
82126	82149	82150	82150	Her	70	“ Why are your panties in such a wad , Gretchen ? So you ’re dating an ugly dude . So what . ”
82154	82169	82215	82215	She	58	“ Oh , I get it . He ’s rich , is n’t he ? ”
82204	82214	82225	82225	Audrey	56	“ You are leaving , Daphne . Right now . ”
82231	82245	82255	82255	Daphne	70	“ Tell everyone you ’re sorry and I wo n’t call your manager . ”
82246	82254	82255	82255	Daphne	70	“ Gee , I ’m sorry everyone , ”
82266	82294	82385	82385	She	70	“ Sorry my sister is being such a lame piece of shit . Gretchen was always the fun , slutty one . Guess Audrey made her boring . ”
82373	82384	82385	82385	She	70	“ All right , all right . I ’m going . ”
82394	82420	82385	82385	She	70	“ If you needed money , sis , all you had to do was ask . No need to whore yourself out to fugly guys . ”
82421	82426	82435	82435	Cade	65	“ Get . Out . ”
82427	82434	82460	82460	She	70	“ Can I be of assistance ? ”
82452	82459	82486	82486	Cade	65	“ Cade . You remembered me . ”
82475	82485	82511	82511	He	65	“ It ’s going to be okay , Daphne , ”
82502	82510	82586	82586	his	84	“ I ’ll take care of you . ”
82589	82614	82622	82622	Gretchen	58	“ I never liked you much , Ms. Petty , but I never thought you were deliberately cruel . I see I was wrong . ”
82615	82621	82649	82649	Eldon	84	“ You ’re still wrong , ”
82637	82648	82671	82671	he	84	“ I ’m not dating Hunter because he ’s rich . ”
82659	82670	82810	82810	She	77	“ I am returning to the party to serve dinner , ”
82819	82828	82834	82834	Gretchen	58	“ Hey , kiddo . Can we talk ? ”
82829	82833	82834	82834	Gretchen	58	“ Right now ? ”
82844	82866	82882	82882	Kat	77	“ Let ’s go to the kitchen , then . I need to make sure the desserts are ready to serve . ”
82891	82896	82882	82882	Kat	77	“ This is impressive . ”
82897	82909	82912	82912	Hunter	57	“ There ’s three of them in the manor , actually . ”
82919	82930	82936	82936	Kat	77	“ The entire house is lovely , is n’t it ? ”
82931	82935	82936	82936	Kat	77	“ I imagine . ”
82961	82967	82991	82991	She	58	“ So is that why ? ”
83003	83007	83020	83020	She	58	“ Why what ? ”
83008	83019	83092	83092	She	58	“ Why you ’re with you know who . Scarface . ”
83103	83117	83092	83092	She	58	“ I do n’t know where you ’re going with this , Kat . ”
83118	83157	83164	83164	Gretchen	58	“ I just wonder if you and him is about money more than lust . I mean , I get it . I like money , too , but jeez . He ’s a lot to take in . ”
83158	83163	83164	83164	Gretchen	58	“ You know me , ”
83168	83177	83231	83231	she	58	“ I ’ll do anything for a paycheck . ”
83238	83251	83231	83231	she	58	“ I ca n’t believe you even had to ask me that . ”
83252	83267	83305	83305	She	58	“ I just have concerns for you . Do you need money that bad ? ”
83294	83304	83375	83375	Hunter	57	“ Honey , I always need money . But — ”
83367	83374	83375	83375	Hunter	57	“ People are asking about you , ”
83387	83398	83406	83406	Gretchen	58	“ I thought I ’d come and check on things . ”
83399	83405	83421	83421	She	58	“ We ’re coming back , ”
83410	83420	83449	83449	she	58	“ We were just making sure dessert was ready . ”
83460	83470	83477	83477	Hunter	57	“ Shall we get back to our dinner guests ? ”
83471	83476	83714	83714	he	1334	“ If we must , ”
83705	83713	83714	83714	he	1334	“ It sounds like a fascinating project , ”
83717	83737	83738	83738	Gretchen	58	“ I ca n’t wait to see the finished manuscript . When do you think you ’ll be done ? ”
83750	83786	83787	83787	He	1334	“ I wanted to ask you about that . I ’ve had a bit of a setback and need a few more weeks to hit my deadline . Is that going to be a problem ? ”
83794	83808	83829	83830	The editor	1385	“ I ’ll run it past our boss and see what he says . ”
83820	83828	83847	83847	He	1334	“ Our ? What do you mean ? ”
83833	83846	83847	83847	He	1334	“ I ’m sure you can wrangle an extension out of him . ”
83854	83862	83863	83863	She	58	“ Just do what you do best . ”
83871	83878	83829	83830	The editor	1385	“ What are you talking about ? ”
83879	83891	83863	83863	She	58	“ Hunter ? It ’s obvious you ’re sleeping with him . ”
83892	83902	83939	83939	Her	58	“ What does that have to do with anything ? ”
83913	83938	83939	83939	Her	58	“ Hunter ’s the owner of Bellefleur Publishing . It was his idea for this project , and he insisted you work on it . ”
83943	83948	84270	84270	she	58	“ I . . . ”
84280	84300	84321	84321	He	57	“ Why does my editor think that if I ask you for an extension , I ’ll get one ? ”
84328	84346	84354	84354	Gretchen	58	“ He has a big mouth . It seems to be a trend with our dinner guests . ”
84347	84353	84362	84362	he	57	“ Daphne ’s not herself . ”
84380	84411	84424	84424	Hunter	57	“ She ’s under a conservatorship because she ca n’t seem to stay out of drugs and alcohol . Audrey ’s spent half her life cleaning up Daphne ’s messes . ”
84412	84423	84424	84424	Hunter	57	“ I do n’t give a shit about your sister , ”
84428	84444	84445	84445	She	58	“ Is that what you came in here to talk about ? I ’m busy . ”
84448	84470	84362	84362	he	57	“ You overheard me talking to Kat , did n’t you ? You ca n’t possibly think all that is true . ”
84471	84486	84362	84362	he	57	“ What part ’s not true ? You were n’t exactly refuting her claims . ”
84487	84512	84445	84445	She	58	“ I would never sleep with you just to get to your wallet . I ’m a little hurt that you think I would . ”
84513	84546	84362	84362	he	57	“ What am I supposed to think , Gretchen ? Your sister proclaims to our dinner party that you enjoy the company of men . Quite a few men , it seems . ”
84547	84562	84584	84584	He	1396	“ So I was a little loose in my teenage years . So what ? ”
84563	84583	84584	84584	He	1396	“ And that you ’re sleeping with an ugly man for money . And you do n’t deny it . ”
84594	84625	84638	84638	Gretchen	58	“ And I find you having the exact same conversation with your agent , and again , you do n’t deny it . Exactly what am I supposed to think ? ”
84626	84637	84658	84658	He	1396	“ Well , for starters , you can trust me , ”
84662	84676	84695	84695	Hunter	57	“ You really think I ’m sleeping with you because you ’re rich ? ”
84681	84694	84698	84698	his	1396	“ I ’m trying to think of another reason why you would , ”
84702	84737	84745	84745	she	58	“ After all , it is acknowledged that I ’m quite ugly . And looking back , you came on to me . So yes , it ’s looking rather suspicious in my mind . ”
84738	84744	84745	84745	she	58	“ Your feelings are hurt , ”
84752	84762	84765	84765	his	57	“ And you ’re taking it out on me . ”
84768	84784	84827	84827	She	58	“ You ’re not the person I thought you were . That much is clear . ”
84785	84826	84827	84827	She	58	“ And who did you think I was ? I ’ve never lied about my family or my finances . You never asked . Why do you think I work all the time at a job that makes me miserable ? ”
84830	84839	84840	84840	He	57	“ It ’s not my stunning work ethic . ”
84844	84907	84915	84915	She	1398	“ And for the record , I came on to you because I wanted you . Because I was drawn to you . You seemed lonely and ached to have someone touch you . And I guess I ’m stupid , because I wanted to touch you and rock your world . I guess that was a bad call on my part . ”
84908	84914	84987	84987	Gretchen	58	“ I guess it was . ”
84995	85006	85048	85048	She	58	“ I ’m sorry if my friends hurt your feelings — ”
85007	85047	85048	85048	She	58	“ They did n’t hurt my feelings . They simply showed me the truth of who you are . I should have known you were too good to be true . All those words you said , just words . ”
85052	85056	84987	84987	Gretchen	58	“ What words ? ”
85057	85098	85048	85048	She	58	“ Your talk of not caring what a man looked like as long as he made you happy . It turns out that you do n’t care what a man looks like as long as he has a full wallet . ”
85099	85128	85157	85157	Strange	123	“ That ’s a lie and you know it . And what are you talking about ? When did I ever say anything about men and their looks ? ”
85159	85187	85254	85254	she	58	“ Ask Brontë . Remember ? You told her that rich men thought they were the heroes of the fairy tale but they were truly the villains . ”
85246	85253	85254	85254	she	58	“ You were spying on me , ”
85258	85265	85318	85318	He	1402	“ That day at the house . ”
85290	85317	85353	85353	she	58	“ It ’s true , is n’t it ? You saw me that day . How ? And what does that have to do with anything ? ”
85362	85395	85433	85433	She	58	“ I do n’t understand what that has to do with anything . We did n’t know each other then . I did n’t meet you until I moved into this house . ”
85436	85478	85544	85544	She	58	“ And you own a new publisher that contacted my agent out of the blue and offered a big paycheck as long as I lived on location . At your house . You set this all up , did n’t you ? ”
85548	85569	85533	85533	Eldon	84	“ I did n’t become a bestseller , did I ? Not really ? Did you buy all those books ? ”
85570	85587	85544	85544	She	58	“ I wanted to do something nice for you . It seems I am a fool . ”
85593	85619	85631	85631	She	58	“ You set this all up to bring me here . There ’s no new publisher . The letters . . . are those fakes ? ”
85635	85687	85688	85688	His	57	“ No wonder the details never matched the house . It ’s not this house , is it ? None of it ’s real . You basically paid me to come and live at your house for a month so I ’d be around you and fall in love with you ? ”
85702	85731	85757	85757	she	58	“ Do n’t try and throw love into this now , Gretchen . We ’re both not fools enough to believe you ’re really in love with me . ”
85747	85756	85757	85757	she	58	“ I ca n’t believe you did this , ”
85761	85782	85791	85791	he	57	“ I ca n’t believe you went to such levels just to try and get me to sleep with you . ”
85783	85790	85791	85791	he	57	“ It ’s not like that , ”
85794	85806	85831	85831	Betrayed	124	“ Is n’t it ? Is n’t that what you did ? ”
85836	85889	85908	85908	She	58	“ Is n’t all this and me being here because you wanted to fuck me ? Do n’t you care that you ’re ruining my life ? You ca n’t just play with people ’s livelihoods because you ’re bored and lonely , Hunter Buchanan . Reality does n’t work that way . ”
85890	85907	85908	85908	She	58	“ Does n’t it ? You certainly came running the moment you heard the dollar amount . ”
85914	85930	85972	85972	She	58	“ You really do think that of me . After all we ’ve been through . ”
85931	85971	86030	86030	she	58	“ What am I supposed to believe , Gretchen ? That you saw my face and thought you needed to have a man like me ? You ’ll forgive me if I do n’t quite fall for that again . ”
86016	86029	86084	86084	She	58	“ Well , thank you for making me feel like a whore , ”
86044	86083	86084	86084	She	58	“ It ’s good to know where I really stand with you . I thought I cared for you and that you cared for me , but I guess I was mistaken in that , was n’t I ? ”
86088	86104	86267	86267	she	58	“ I guess we ’re both in love with a person who did n’t exist . ”
86257	86266	86267	86267	she	58	“ We ’re going home tomorrow , Igor , ”
86271	86277	86306	86306	She	58	“ We ’re done here . ”
86318	86358	86870	86870	her	58	“ I wonder if it was even you that knocked over that glass of water , Igor . I ’m starting to think Hunter tramples on anyone just to get what he wants . No wonder he ’s alone . ”
86888	86894	86954	86954	He	79	“ Where are you going ? ”
86940	86953	86954	86954	He	79	“ I ’m leaving . I just need to call a cab . ”
86965	86977	86984	86984	she	58	“ You have n’t finished the project you were hired for . ”
86978	86983	86984	86984	she	58	“ It was delayed , ”
86991	87010	87017	87017	She	58	“ Though I ’m guessing the delay was just as manufactured as the project , was n’t it ? ”
87024	87031	87036	87036	He	79	“ Good - bye , Hunter . ”
87032	87035	87036	87036	He	79	“ Wait . ”
87047	87059	87068	87068	she	58	“ You need to hear what I ’m going to say . ”
87076	87081	87082	87082	Hunter	57	“ What is it ? ”
87099	87153	87164	87164	she	58	“ I ’ve decided that I do n’t care that you only want me for my money . I have more than enough of it . If you stay with me , I ’ll continue to pay your bills as long as you continue to provide companionship . . . at all levels . ”
87169	87181	87213	87213	Gretchen	58	“ You said you loved me just a few days ago . ”
87182	87212	87215	87215	her	58	“ What I feel for you has no bearing on a business arrangement . I want your body . I want what we had before . Name your price . ”
87222	87230	87164	87164	she	58	“ You ’re killing me , Hunter . ”
87231	87235	87164	87164	she	58	“ One million . ”
87240	87252	87257	87257	His	1431	“ Fuck you . You ca n’t buy me like that . ”
87253	87256	87257	87257	His	1431	“ No ? ”
87265	87306	87322	87322	she	58	“ You do n’t approve of the direct route ? Very well , then . I ’ll speak with Preston Stewart and see about contracting another on - site project for you . I ’m sure we can arrange something . ”
87313	87321	87322	87322	she	58	“ I ache for you , Hunter , ”
87329	87380	87403	87403	She	58	“ That you think such awful things of me , and that you ’re so lonely that you ’re still willing to have someone at your side despite thinking they loathe you . That they ’re turned off by your face . You deserve to have someone who loves you . ”
87389	87402	87410	87410	he	1432	“ I wish you nothing but the best . I really do . ”
87416	87420	87423	87423	her	58	“ Two million . ”
87426	87466	87472	87472	he	1432	“ Someday you ’re going to learn that money ca n’t buy everything , Hunter . You ca n’t manipulate people just because you have a bigger wallet . It ’s going to make you very , very lonely . ”
87467	87471	87472	87472	he	1432	“ Three million , ”
87476	87483	87616	87616	her	56	“ Good - bye , Hunter . ”
87623	87632	87647	87648	Brontë Dawson	59	“ Logan Hawkings ’s office , Audrey speaking . ”
87633	87640	87647	87648	Brontë Dawson	59	“ Hey , it ’s me . ”
87659	87676	87647	87648	Brontë Dawson	59	“ I need to talk to Logan , but I ’m glad I got you first . ”
87677	87680	87695	87695	Brontë	59	“ Oh ? ”
87681	87694	87695	87695	Brontë	59	“ I wanted to see how things were going with your sister , ”
87698	87704	87787	87787	Audrey	56	“ How is she doing ? ”
87780	87786	87787	87787	Audrey	56	“ She ’s a mess , ”
87794	87800	87776	87776	she	56	“ Nothing new about that . ”
87801	87818	87823	87823	Audrey	56	“ Oh , no . Poor Gretchen . She must be taking this breakup so hard . ”
87831	87834	87787	87787	Audrey	56	“ Gretchen ? ”
87835	87841	87823	87823	Audrey	56	“ Yes . Your sister ? ”
87842	87845	87914	87914	Audrey	56	“ Oh . ”
87905	87913	87914	87914	Audrey	56	“ Gretchen ’s having a tough time , ”
87917	87929	87891	87891	she	58	“ She lost her apartment so she ’s staying with me . ”
87930	87936	87975	87975	Audrey	56	“ Does she need money ? ”
87937	87974	87975	87975	Audrey	56	“ Money ’s not a problem . Daph has money . Gretchen could ask me for money . She would n’t take it , though . And money seems to be the least of her problems . ”
87984	87997	87891	87891	she	58	“ She just sits on my couch and cries all day long . ”
87998	88013	88024	88024	Audrey	56	“ Cries ? Gretchen ? Really ? She seems so . . . strong . ”
88014	88023	88024	88024	Audrey	56	“ Well , not when she ’s dumped , ”
88044	88107	88024	88024	Audrey	56	“ She has n’t moved from my sofa in two days . She just keeps watching bad movies and reading my books and weeping . I came home yesterday to find her sobbing her brains out at Phantom of the Opera . She kept going on and on about how Christine was a bitch because the Phantom needed her love and support . ”
88108	88117	88024	88024	Audrey	56	“ Oh , jeez . That ’s awkward . ”
88118	88124	88149	88149	Brontë	59	“ You ’re telling me . ”
88125	88148	88149	88149	Brontë	59	“ You know , I never thought Hunter would hook up with Gretchen . He just seems so . . . remote . ”
88153	88161	88176	88176	Brontë	59	“ I wish I could help her . ”
88162	88175	88176	88176	Brontë	59	“ I can send her to your place for a few days . ”
88179	88191	88255	88255	She	58	“ Somehow I do n’t think Logan wants to watch Phantom . ”
88262	88274	88329	88329	Audrey	56	“ I ’m not quite sure what to do with her . ”
88275	88328	88425	88425	Brontë	59	“ Well , it ’s obvious ! We have to get the two of them back together . Hunter ’s so lonely and Gretchen ’s so bold and clever . I think she ’s good for him . Logan said that he ’d never seen Hunter happier than when they were together . ”
88362	88377	88425	88425	Brontë	59	“ I ’m not good with match - making , Brontë . Fair warning . ”
88378	88396	88407	88407	Audrey	56	“ Me either . But we ’ll ask Logan to intercede . Hunter will listen to him . ”
88397	88406	88407	88407	Audrey	56	“ What ’s this ‘ we ’ stuff ? ”
88411	88424	88425	88425	Brontë	59	“ You ’re his fiancée . I ’m merely the hired help . ”
88429	88444	88454	88454	Audrey	56	“ Okay then , I ’ll handle it . Put me through to him . ”
88445	88453	88842	88843	Preston Hunter	128	“ Just get her off my couch , ”
88856	88861	88842	88843	Preston Hunter	128	“ Preston Stewart speaking . ”
88862	88871	88842	88843	Preston Hunter	128	“ Why do we need a new ghostwriter ? ”
88872	88899	88906	88906	Hunter	57	“ Ah . Mr. Buchanan . Very nice to talk to you again . I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed the party the — ”
88900	88905	88906	88906	Hunter	57	“ Explain to me , ”
88917	88925	88930	88930	Preston	107	“ why we need a new ghostwriter . ”
88926	88929	88930	88930	Preston	107	“ Well , ”
88933	88978	88906	88906	Hunter	57	“ I got a call from Ms. Petty ’s agent earlier today . She ’s off the project . Since we have n’t signed anything , there ’s no money to collect as of yet . Kat and I were still working on negotiations — ”
88979	88991	88930	88930	Preston	107	“ What do you mean , she ’s off the project ? ”
88992	89006	88930	88930	Preston	107	“ I mean she quit . She does n’t want to do it . ”
89007	89015	89025	89026	The editor	1385	“ Did you offer her more money ? ”
89029	89042	89206	89206	Hunter	57	“ Mr. Buchanan , that ’s not how publishing works . I — ”
89215	89218	89226	89227	The assistant	1470	“ Eldon ? ”
89219	89225	89251	89251	He	57	“ Yes , Mr. Buchanan ? ”
89238	89250	89288	89288	Eldon	84	“ Bring the car around . I need to go out . ”
89291	89295	89361	89361	Hunter	57	“ Of course . ”
89356	89360	89395	89395	He	57	“ Wait here , ”
89387	89394	89673	89673	He	55	“ I ’ll be back shortly . ”
89653	89672	89679	89679	his	55	“ I ’ve had something come up . Someone send me the meeting notes when you ’re done . ”
89693	89699	89673	89673	He	55	“ Do n’t you knock ? ”
89700	89705	89780	89780	Logan	55	“ Where ’s Audrey ? ”
89758	89779	89780	89780	Logan	55	“ Probably getting my lunch from the cafe downstairs . Calm the fuck down . What ’s wrong with you ? ”
89785	89792	89833	89833	He	57	“ I need to find Gretchen . ”
89823	89832	89853	89853	Logan	55	“ So you admit that you fucked up ? ”
89840	89852	89857	89857	his	55	“ What are you talking about ? What do you know ? ”
89878	89889	89869	89869	his	55	“ I know that Brontë ’s been talking to Gretchen . ”
89890	89893	89898	89898	Logan	55	“ And ? ”
89894	89897	89898	89898	Logan	55	“ And , ”
89901	89922	89932	89932	She	58	“ she says she ’s really upset . Cries a lot . You fucked it up , did n’t you ? ”
89950	89956	89967	89967	Hunter	57	“ What did she say ? ”
89957	89966	89967	89967	Hunter	57	“ First you tell me what you did . ”
89981	89991	89932	89932	She	58	“ She found out the project was a sham . ”
89992	90021	89932	89932	She	58	“ And that made her cry ? Damn , she ’s a sensitive type , is n’t she ? I would n’t have pictured her as the type — ”
90022	90034	89932	89932	She	58	“ Then I accused her of sleeping with me for money . ”
90035	90038	89932	89932	She	58	“ Ah . ”
90039	90076	90100	90100	Logan	55	“ And then when she was packing , I told her that I did n’t care if she loved me or not . I ’d pay her to use her body regardless of how she felt . ”
90093	90099	90100	90100	Logan	55	“ She turned it down . ”
90103	90114	90119	90119	Hunter	57	“ Yeah . I ’d say you fucked it up . ”
90115	90118	90119	90119	Hunter	57	“ Shit . ”
90124	90142	90100	90100	Logan	55	“ I thought for sure that she was using me for my money . Her agent said — ”
90143	90152	90169	90169	Audrey	56	“ Her agent thinks everything ’s about money , ”
90159	90168	90190	90190	her	56	“ Or did n’t Gretchen tell you that ? ”
90195	90210	90221	90221	Logan	55	“ Or were you too busy calling her a whore and a money grubber ? ”
90211	90220	90231	90231	Audrey	56	“ Audrey , this is not the place — ”
90224	90230	90231	90231	Audrey	56	“ The door was open , ”
90238	90250	90257	90257	Hunter	57	“ I ’m sorry . I overheard . I ’ll leave . ”
90251	90256	90257	90257	Hunter	57	“ No ! Stay . ”
90263	90278	90292	90292	she	56	“ What makes you so sure she was n’t with me for my money ? ”
90288	90291	90292	90292	she	56	“ Because , ”
90296	90345	90394	90394	Audrey	56	“ If she wanted to freeload off someone , she ’d freeload off Daphne , who has millions . Or Cooper , who ’s so in love with her that he ’d buy her whatever she wants . Why would she need to sleep with someone for that ? ”
90374	90393	90394	90394	Audrey	56	“ I suppose the better question is , what made you think Gretchen wanted you for your money ? ”
90397	90408	90418	90418	he	57	“ Did she ever give you reason to think that ? ”
90409	90417	90436	90436	He	57	“ Every time she looked at me , ”
90421	90435	90460	90460	Audrey	56	“ I ’m supposed to believe that she wants to be with this ? ”
90466	90475	90460	90460	Audrey	56	“ Why is that so hard to believe ? ”
90476	90483	90492	90492	Audrey	56	“ Because I ’m a monster . ”
90484	90491	90492	90492	Audrey	56	“ My sister ’s a romantic , ”
90496	90502	90563	90563	Audrey	56	“ Maybe she likes monsters . ”
90536	90551	90563	90563	Audrey	56	“ Why ’d she turn down the writing project ? She needs the money . ”
90552	90562	90563	90563	Audrey	56	“ She does n’t need the money that bad , ”
90585	90600	90689	90689	he	57	“ She ’d rather be broke than work on that project a moment longer . ”
90701	90709	90714	90714	Logan	55	“ How do I get her back ? ”
90710	90713	90714	90714	Logan	55	“ Groveling , ”
90718	90728	90729	90729	Audrey	56	“ Take it from me . Lots of groveling . ”
90740	90746	90749	90749	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s a start . ”
90764	90768	90796	90796	She	58	“ You okay ? ”
90792	90795	90796	90796	She	58	“ Yeah . ”
90803	90810	90785	90785	He	57	“ It ’s just my book . ”
90811	90815	90822	90822	she	58	“ Sad ending ? ”
90816	90821	91202	91202	Cooper	62	“ Something like that , ”
91194	91201	91210	91210	He	57	“ You sure you ’re okay ? ”
91221	91229	91238	91238	she	58	“ I hate seeing you so unhappy . ”
91230	91237	91353	91353	Cooper	62	“ I ’m fine , really , ”
91349	91352	91360	91360	She	58	“ Gretchen , ”
91366	91375	91381	91381	he	57	“ Oh , Cooper , please do n’t — ”
91376	91380	91409	91409	He	57	“ I know , ”
91385	91408	91409	91409	He	57	“ I know . It ’s weird between us right now , is n’t it ? I should have never said anything . ”
91419	91447	91463	91463	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s not that , Cooper . I just . . . wish we could go back to the way things were before , you know ? ”
91448	91462	91463	91463	Gretchen	58	“ Before I gave you my heart and you stomped it to pieces ? ”
91472	91475	91482	91482	he	57	“ I — ”
91476	91481	91482	91482	he	57	“ I ’m kidding , ”
91489	91577	91586	91586	she	1522	“ I ’ll be honest , I wish things could be different between you and me . But even what we had before was better than what we have now . I know you do n’t care for me the way I care for you . And that ’s fine , Gretchen . But it hurts me that we ca n’t even be friends anymore . I ’d rather we acknowledge the problem , move past it , and get back to being just Gretchen and Cooper . ”
91602	91610	91615	91615	he	1523	“ I ’m so sorry , Coop . ”
91611	91614	91615	91615	he	1523	“ Hey , ”
91619	91624	91625	91625	He	1523	“ Do n’t apologize . ”
91638	91656	91659	91659	her	1522	“ I ’m sorry I got all weird on you when you needed a friend the most . ”
91667	91682	91688	91688	he	1523	“ You ’re such a good friend . I ’m not normally this emotional . ”
91683	91687	91739	91739	she	1522	“ I know , ”
91720	91738	91739	91739	she	1522	“ I ’m glad that we ’re going to go back to just being Gretchen and Coop , ”
91745	91777	91778	91778	He	1523	“ And I ’m sorry I did n’t fall in love with you . If I could have picked to fall in love with someone , it would have been you . ”
91794	91847	91964	91964	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s okay , Gretch . I know you ’re in love with Buchanan . It was obvious as soon as I saw him with you . You lit up around him in a way I ’ve never seen . I ’ve had a few weeks to get over you now . ”
91960	91963	92108	92108	She	1525	“ Hunter , ”
92113	92116	92117	92117	He	57	“ Hunter ! ”
92125	92129	92158	92158	He	57	“ Hunter Buchanan . ”
92138	92157	92174	92174	He	57	“ Turn around , damn it , or I ’m going to run straight into all this traffic . ”
92189	92195	92174	92174	He	57	“ What do you want ? ”
92206	92213	92203	92203	his	57	“ You were bringing me flowers ? ”
92214	92219	92243	92243	he	57	“ I was not . ”
92220	92241	92299	92299	he	57	“ Really ? I suppose you just throw flowers into every garbage can outside of a coffee shop , then ? ”
92292	92298	92299	92299	he	57	“ I threw them away , ”
92306	92315	92338	92338	His	57	“ I noticed . You should n’t have . ”
92316	92337	92343	92343	She	1525	“ Why not ? It ’s clear you ’ve moved on . Anything I say will fall on deaf ears . ”
92351	92358	92359	92359	He	57	“ Were you coming to apologize ? ”
92366	92395	92408	92408	He	57	“ Then why does it matter if I ’ve moved on ? You made it clear you just wanted my body . You think I ’m for sale . ”
92396	92407	92413	92413	she	1525	“ I was wrong . I should have trusted you . ”
92423	92440	92463	92463	he	57	“ You should have . You should have believed that you ca n’t buy my affection . ”
92441	92452	92570	92570	Her	1525	“ What other choice does a man like me have ? ”
92574	92586	92602	92602	he	57	“ You ’re not ugly , Hunter . Not to me . ”
92587	92601	92602	92602	he	57	“ You ’ll have to forgive me if I do n’t believe that , ”
92609	92627	92651	92651	Gretchen	58	“ I ’ve had a lifetime of being reassured that I ’m only wanted for my fortune . ”
92628	92650	92651	92651	Gretchen	58	“ Well , if you do n’t believe that , then I guess you do n’t have much faith in me , ”
92658	92673	92678	92678	he	57	“ And that hurts me that you think I ’m that shallow and mercenary . ”
92682	92688	92654	92654	her	58	“ I did n’t mean — ”
92689	92716	92771	92771	He	57	“ Did n’t you ? You ’re saying I ’m an awful person who will only fuck a man if he ’s got a fat wallet . ”
92760	92770	92771	92771	He	57	“ How do you think that makes me feel ? ”
92774	92793	92799	92799	she	58	“ Not bad enough , it seems . I see you ’ve already moved on to your friend . ”
92806	92856	92883	92883	she	58	“ Ugh ! Will you just listen to yourself for a moment ? You ’re so convinced that you ’re some sort of hideous beast that you think that someone ca n’t possibly see the true you inside . Yeah , well I saw the true you , buddy . ”
92891	93009	93096	93096	she	1543	“ I saw a man who isolates himself because he ’s worried about making other people uncomfortable . I saw a man who does n’t leave his house very often , but makes sure that the staff is well paid . I saw a man who works all day tirelessly and tends to roses because he enjoys their beauty . I saw a man who expects perfection in himself but is okay with others treating him like dirt . I see a man who shuts out the world because he ’s so afraid of getting hurt again . And you tell me I ’m the one with the problem ? How about you look in the mirror ? ”
93019	93095	93096	93096	she	1543	“ How about you take a long , hard look at that asshole butler of yours ? How about you hire someone who you actually enjoy being around ? You ’re a wonderful person , Hunter . You ’re shy but you ’re incredibly giving and thoughtful , and you have a poetic soul under all that muscle . If you ’re lonely , it ’s because you ’ve isolated yourself . You have friends ! ”
93099	93131	93192	93192	Gretchen	58	“ Your buddies thought you were happy at the dinner party and I saw their faces . They were happy for you . Why ca n’t you be happy for you ? ”
93186	93191	93192	93192	Gretchen	58	“ No , Hunter , ”
93196	93214	93264	93264	He	1545	“ I care about you , I really do . But I ’m still mad at you . ”
93215	93263	93319	93319	Hunter	57	“ I want you with me , Gretchen . If you can forgive me for what I said , I want you at my side . I just have a hard time believing that someone as perfect as you would want to be with someone like me . ”
93312	93318	93319	93319	Hunter	57	“ Am I too late ? ”
93332	93345	93319	93319	Hunter	57	“ Is that it ? You ’ve moved on ? To him ? ”
93353	93376	93383	93383	His	1545	“ I was sad and Cooper was comforting me . We ’re just friends . That ’s all we ’ll ever be . ”
93377	93382	93383	93383	His	1545	“ You were sad ? ”
93390	93393	93405	93405	his	1545	“ Why ? ”
93394	93400	93418	93418	herself	58	“ Why do you think ? ”
93424	93432	93405	93405	his	1545	“ I ’m still mad at you . ”
93433	93440	93418	93418	herself	58	“ But you ’ll forgive me . ”
93441	93445	93452	93452	His	1545	“ Not today . ”
93446	93451	93469	93469	Gretchen	58	“ Tomorrow , then . ”
93458	93468	93469	93469	Gretchen	58	“ Maybe not tomorrow . I ’m still deciding , ”
93484	93495	93501	93501	he	1545	“ You need to make some changes first , though . ”
93496	93500	93508	93508	she	58	“ I will , ”
93504	93507	93508	93508	she	58	“ Good ! ”
93514	93526	93752	93752	Cooper	62	“ And next time , do n’t throw away my roses ! ”
93762	93775	93780	93780	she	58	“ Thank God you ’re here . Did you see this mess ? ”
93776	93779	93780	93780	she	58	“ Mess ? ”
93784	93791	93752	93752	Cooper	62	“ I think they ’re beautiful . ”
93792	93824	93829	93829	she	58	“ The first delivery showed up a few hours ago , and they ’ve been coming in all morning . I think someone bought every purple rose in the entire city . ”
93825	93828	93829	93829	she	58	“ Blue , ”
93849	93854	93887	93887	He	1555	“ They ’re blue . ”
93855	93886	93891	93891	Gretchen	58	“ Well , there ’s no name for the recipient . No sender . Just flowers coming in from every single florist in all of Manhattan . It ’s crazy . ”
93909	93916	93829	93829	she	58	“ I think it ’s sweet . ”
93917	93930	93939	93939	she	58	“ I do n’t know what to do with all of them . ”
93931	93938	94395	94395	Cooper	62	“ Give them out to customers , ”
94391	94394	94395	94395	Cooper	62	“ Well , ”
94413	94423	94429	94429	Gretchen	58	“ We finally got a note with the roses . ”
94424	94428	94429	94429	Gretchen	58	“ We did ? ”
94440	94445	94429	94429	Gretchen	58	“ Where is it ? ”
94451	94461	94477	94477	She	58	“ How ’d you know it was for you ? ”
94462	94476	94562	94562	Cooper	62	“ Just a hunch . Now , where ’s my letter ? Gimme . ”
94556	94561	94562	94562	Cooper	62	“ What is that ? ”
94570	94574	94582	94582	Gretchen	58	“ Looks old . ”
94575	94581	94582	94582	Gretchen	58	“ It ’s a letter , ”
94589	94596	94597	94597	She	58	“ And it ’s very old . ”
94614	94622	94627	94627	Cooper	62	“ I need a moment in private . ”
94623	94626	95135	95135	she	58	“ Sure , ”
95151	95160	95161	95161	He	1580	“ I have to run out , Cooper . ”
95174	95179	95192	95192	she	58	“ You coming back ? ”
95180	95191	95630	95631	the receptionist	1482	“ I am . I just need to see something , ”
95621	95629	95705	95705	She	1482	“ Well , hi there , ma’am , ”
95711	95733	95762	95762	Gretchen	58	“ Do n’t just stand in the hall like you done lost your britches . We do n’t bite in here ! ”
95756	95761	95762	95762	Gretchen	58	“ Um , hi . ”
95773	95784	95793	95794	the girl	632	“ I was just , uh , looking for someone . ”
95785	95792	95806	95806	She	58	“ Well , I ’m someone , ”
95797	95805	95806	95806	She	58	“ Can I help you find something ? ”
95812	95819	95826	95827	the girl	632	“ Is this the Buchanan office ? ”
95820	95825	95854	95854	she	632	“ It surely is , ”
95830	95853	95854	95854	she	632	“ My name ’s Maylee — that ’s all one word , not two . It ’s after my Nana and Pepaw , ”
95870	95885	95826	95827	the girl	632	“ I ’m Mr. Buchanan ’s secretary . It ’s nice to meet you . ”
95886	95909	95925	95925	She	632	“ Nice to meet you , too . I ’m sorry , I ’m just . . . is Mr. Buchanan here ? ”
95910	95924	95925	95925	She	632	“ Naw . He went to lunch with some fancy - looking guys . ”
95944	95958	95826	95827	the girl	632	“ Gimme your name again and I ’ll tell him you stopped by . ”
95959	95966	95974	95974	Maylee	129	“ It ’s Gretchen . I — ”
95967	95973	95974	95974	Maylee	129	“ Oh , my lordamercy ! ”
95982	96008	96099	96099	Maylee	129	“ Mr. Hunter ’s your beau , ai n’t he ? Oh , my gosh . You are so pretty ! Of course you are . ”
96084	96098	96109	96109	She	129	“ Mr. Hunter ’s gon na be so dang sad he missed you , ”
96125	96171	96189	96189	She	58	“ He makes me call all the flower shops in the city lookin ’ for your flowers , you know . Man ’s lost his cotton - pickin ’ mind over you , if you do n’t mind saying so . It ’s really cute . ”
96196	96207	96213	96213	Maylee	129	“ Do you know what time he ’ll be back ? ”
96208	96212	96213	96213	Maylee	129	“ No ma’am , ”
96216	96237	96244	96244	Gretchen	58	“ But if you ’ll give me your number , I ’ll give you a holler when he gets back . ”
96238	96243	96244	96244	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s okay , ”
96255	96262	96274	96274	Maylee	129	“ I ’ll swing by tomorrow . ”
96263	96273	96283	96283	she	58	“ I ’ll be sure and tell Mr. Hunter , ”

96898	96909	96910	96910	He	131	“ Where exactly did you find that secretary of yours ? ”
96913	96920	96921	96921	His	131	“ It ’s a long story . ”
96930	96935	97006	97006	Lovely	83	“ You look gorgeous . ”
97008	97019	97044	97044	He	131	“ I thought I ’d come by and say hi . ”
97054	97058	97102	97102	Hunter	131	“ Please sit . ”
97087	97101	97168	97168	Gretchen	58	“ I wanted to come by and say thank you for the roses . ”
97172	97185	97195	97195	She	58	“ Nice office . I did n’t know you had one here . ”
97186	97194	97195	97195	She	58	“ I did n’t until last week . ”
97202	97212	97219	97219	he	131	“ What made you decide that you needed one ? ”
97213	97218	97219	97219	he	131	“ You were right , ”
97223	97335	97343	97343	he	1631	“ I ’ve been hiding away from the world for a long time . I told you about my accident . Things were n’t easy for me after that . It became easier to hide from the world than to go out into it . When I . . . returned to my father ’s house after the hospital , he hired private tutors for me and I hid from the world . He ’d insisted I go to college , though . I tried to get out of it , but he refused . It was like living in a waking nightmare . Being amongst all those strangers . . . ”
97348	97367	97372	97372	he	1631	“ College was n’t easy for me . If it were n’t for the friendship of . . . ”
97382	97434	97435	97435	He	1631	“ Logan and the others , I would have never made it through . I was picked on and women flinched at the sight of me . When I inherited my father ’s business , I set up in my house and it was just easier not to leave unless necessary . ”
97438	97467	97497	97497	His	1631	“ It became easier to avoid the world than to live in it . . . until I met you . You ’re why I bought this place . ”
97473	97496	97522	97522	He	1631	“ So I made you buy real estate ? That ’s a pretty good super - power , I have to admit . ”
97505	97521	97522	97522	He	1631	“ I already owned this office . I just decided to keep it for myself . ”
97535	97551	97561	97561	she	58	“ It reminds me to be out there in life , instead of hiding away . ”
97552	97560	97561	97561	she	58	“ I ’m very proud of you , ”
97565	97592	97618	97618	Hunter	131	“ And I hope that you someday realize that you ’re not this monster you ’ve painted yourself to be . You ’re just a man . ”
97607	97617	97661	97661	she	58	“ I took your advice about Eldon , too . ”
97665	97671	97681	97681	Hunter	131	“ He ’s very loyal — ”
97672	97680	97750	97750	She	58	“ He ’s a cranky old bastard , ”
97684	97749	97752	97752	her	58	“ But yes , he ’s very loyal . He ’s also elderly and has family in the west . I gave him a very large retirement bonus as thanks for his tireless work , and I suggested he visit his daughters for a time . And I hired some additional staff at Buchanan Manor . It ’s rather . . . quiet lately . ”
97760	97779	97785	97785	he	1635	“ Maylee ’s not exactly what I had in mind when I suggested you hire a new assistant . ”
97788	97797	97814	97814	Hunter	131	“ Maylee is a . . . problem . ”
97798	97806	97814	97814	Hunter	131	“ She seems like a sweet girl . ”
97807	97813	97848	97848	he	131	“ That is the problem . ”
97824	97847	97848	97848	he	131	“ When I had Eldon call the agency , I told them to find me someone pleasant . She ’s very pleasant , ”
97855	97880	97887	97887	He	1635	“ But I feel I should have been more specific . She ’s not good with computers . Or phones . Or the copier . ”
97897	97933	97887	97887	He	1635	“ Yesterday , she set up a meeting for a client and then did n’t tell me about it because she could n’t find her sticky note . I was extremely . . . annoyed . ”
97934	97944	97964	97964	Gretchen	58	“ Oh , no . What did you do ? ”
97945	97963	97964	97964	Gretchen	58	“ I suggested she use the computer to keep my schedule instead of Post - it notes . ”
97979	97986	97991	97991	he	1635	“ And what did she say ? ”
97987	97990	97991	97991	he	1635	“ Nothing , ”
97998	98002	97964	97964	Gretchen	58	“ She cried . ”
98003	98009	98024	98024	Gretchen	58	“ What did you do ? ”
98010	98023	98024	98024	Gretchen	58	“ What else could I do ? I gave her a raise . ”
98029	98032	98033	98033	He	1635	“ Really ? ”
98037	98079	98086	98086	Gretchen	58	“ This is her first job since leaving Arkansas and no one else will hire her because she is a hick , as she likes to tell me . I ca n’t fire the poor girl simply because she ’s unorganized . ”
98080	98085	98086	98086	Gretchen	58	“ You big softy , ”
98095	98106	98112	98112	His	1635	“ Maybe you should hire an assistant for your assistant . ”
98107	98111	98112	98112	His	1635	“ Maybe so . ”
98121	98126	98174	98174	Hunter	131	“ You look beautiful . ”
98169	98173	98174	98174	Hunter	131	“ Forgive me , ”
98181	98197	98198	98198	She	58	“ I ’m not trying to make you uncomfortable . Did you see my invitation ? ”
98205	98220	98221	98221	His	131	“ I have n’t been by work yet . You sent me an invitation ? ”
98226	98252	98257	98257	she	58	“ Today ’s flowers came with an invitation to a charity fundraiser scheduled for this weekend . A ball . It ’s at Buchanan Manor . ”
98266	98289	98290	98290	Hunter	131	“ You ’re hosting a charity ball ? Are you serious ? Who are you and what have you done with Hunter ? ”
98297	98330	98331	98331	Polite	134	“ I was approached because the venue that the charity ball had originally been scheduled for cancelled on them . They were desperate . It seemed like the polite thing to do . ”
98340	98346	98331	98331	Polite	134	“ What should I wear ? ”
98354	98366	98347	98347	His	131	“ Something formal . I ’m told there will be dancing . ”
98367	98376	98347	98347	His	131	“ Do you plan on dancing with me ? ”
98377	98385	98403	98403	she	58	“ If you ’ll be my date . ”
98386	98402	98417	98417	he	131	“ Oh , you just want me to be your date because I put out , ”
98423	98433	98485	98485	he	131	“ I ’m sorry you think that of me . ”
98474	98484	98485	98485	he	131	“ The invitation is yours if you want it , ”
98493	98510	98546	98546	she	58	“ Feel free to decline with no obligations . It was meant as a friendly gesture . ”
98538	98545	98923	98923	She	319	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
98908	98922	98923	98923	She	319	“ Would you like a hors d’oeuvres — oh , Gretchen ! Hello ! ”
98929	98936	98981	98981	she	319	“ Brandy , how are you ? ”
98977	98980	98981	98981	she	319	“ Busy , ”
98995	99014	99024	99024	She	58	“ But happy . There ’s been lots of changes in this house in the last two weeks . ”
99015	99023	99077	99077	Gretchen	58	“ Oh ? What kind of changes ? ”
99059	99076	99077	99077	Gretchen	58	“ Well , first of all , he got rid of that nasty assistant of his . ”
99080	99085	99152	99152	She	58	“ So I heard . ”
99086	99113	99077	99077	Gretchen	58	“ Yup . From what I hear , he ’s got three assistants now . Two localized here in the house and one at the office . ”
99114	99124	99152	99152	She	58	“ Three . That seems like a big change . ”
99125	99151	99152	99152	She	58	“ It is . And that ’s not all . That man of yours hired more staff and gave the rest of us a raise . ”
99157	99166	99173	99173	Gretchen	58	“ I got a Christmas bonus , too . ”
99167	99172	99173	99173	Gretchen	58	“ That ’s wonderful , ”
99179	99193	99195	99195	Brandy	135	“ But I do n’t know that he ’s my man . I — ”
99213	99220	99797	99797	he	1660	“ Hi there . Hors d’oeuvres ? ”
99807	99817	99818	99818	She	58	“ Gretchen . You look . . . lovely . ”
99832	99837	99874	99878	A tall , slinky woman	1678	“ Hi , Hunter . ”
99890	99897	99904	99904	Hunter	57	“ I seem to be underdressed . ”
99898	99903	99904	99904	Hunter	57	“ On the contrary , ”
99907	99932	99946	99946	He	57	“ You ’re the most gorgeous thing in this room . You do n’t need flash to improve your beauty . Just your smile . ”
99941	99945	99956	99956	she	58	“ You flirt . ”
99951	99955	99989	99989	he	57	“ Nice party , ”
99975	99980	99989	99989	he	57	“ You did well . ”
99981	99988	100004	100004	She	58	“ I did it for you , ”
100008	100014	100043	100043	She	58	“ You did , huh ? ”
100015	100042	100045	100045	her	58	“ All for you . Everything . I want to prove to you that . . . I can be who you need me to be . ”
100048	100058	100062	100065	someone in the crowd	1682	“ Hunter , all I ’ve ever needed was — ”
100070	100078	100086	100086	he	57	“ Maybe this is a bad time . ”
100079	100085	100095	100095	he	57	“ Not a bad time , ”
100111	100116	100286	100286	he	57	“ Come with me . ”
100280	100285	100311	100311	she	58	“ You ’re well ? ”
100305	100310	100325	100325	she	58	“ Actually , no , ”
100328	100359	100401	100401	He	57	“ There ’s this guy who kind of broke my heart . He lied to me and sabotaged my work just so I could stay around him a bit longer . ”
100377	100400	100401	100401	He	57	“ And would you have gone out with me ? Not knowing me ? Not knowing who I was except for this ? ”
100411	100429	100401	100401	He	57	“ How am I supposed to believe that ? People turn away at the sight of me . ”
100438	100457	100401	100401	He	57	“ Oh , Hunter . Just because most people are shallow assholes does n’t mean that I am . ”
100458	100466	100477	100477	she	58	“ But how would I know this ? ”
100467	100476	100477	100477	she	58	“ It does n’t matter , does it ? ”
100481	100518	100531	100531	he	57	“ We ’ll never know that , because you manipulated the situation and lied to me . You messed with my career . You ca n’t just make up jobs to bring people into your life . ”
100519	100530	100531	100531	he	57	“ You can still have the money , you know , ”
100536	100551	100552	100552	She	58	“ I never meant to force you to choose between your happiness and me . ”
100561	100606	100635	100635	his	57	“ It ’s not about the money , Hunter . When will you get that ? It ’s about you and me and trust . How can I trust that you ’re not pulling strings behind the scenes again anytime something goes my way ? ”
100607	100627	100635	100635	his	57	“ How can I trust that you truly want me for who I am and not what I am ? ”
100638	100651	100677	100677	his	57	“ Oh , Hunter . You have to have faith in me . ”
100685	100701	100708	100708	His	57	“ I love you so much , Gretchen . Please do n’t leave me again . ”
100702	100707	100708	100708	His	57	“ Then trust me . ”
100712	100721	100726	100726	her	58	“ It ’s hard for me to trust . ”
100729	100754	100755	100755	He	57	“ I get that you ’re damaged , but how do you think I feel knowing you ’ve been manipulating things since day one ? ”
100767	100775	100790	100790	Her	58	“ I never meant to hurt you . ”
100776	100789	100829	100829	He	57	“ I know . And that ’s why I ’ve come back . ”
100807	100828	100857	100857	she	58	“ It was the only way you knew how to reach out to me . I forgive you for that . ”
100840	100856	100857	100857	she	58	“ I still have n’t forgiven you for the sabotage of my laptop , though , ”
100861	100868	100882	100882	he	57	“ That was kind of low . ”
100869	100881	100882	100882	he	57	“ I did n’t realize Eldon was going to do that , ”
100886	100895	100918	100918	his	57	“ I just wanted him to delay you . ”
100896	100913	100972	100972	She	58	“ Oh , he delayed me all right . Killed my contract dead in the water . ”
100954	100971	100972	100972	She	58	“ The files were recovered , by the way . I can send you the information . ”
100975	101051	101120	101120	He	1697	“ I ’m a lot happier without writing , honestly . It ’s not a profession I ’m very good at . The constant deadlines drive me crazy , and if I have to write one more astronaut story I just might jump off your balcony . Without the contracts , I ’m pretty broke but I ’m also a lot happier — and less stressed — than I ’ve been in a long time . ”
101052	101100	101108	101108	She	58	“ Preston will be sorry to hear that . He contacted me the other day and suggested that if you did n’t want to do the epistolary novel that perhaps you ’d be interested in doing a cookbook . He loved your cooking at the dinner party . ”
101101	101107	101108	101108	She	58	“ A cookbook , huh ? ”
101115	101119	101120	101120	He	1697	“ Your idea ? ”
101127	101148	101157	101157	she	58	“ It was all him , I ’m afraid . For once , I had nothing to do with it . ”
101149	101156	101190	101190	Gretchen	58	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
101202	101209	101219	101219	His	1697	“ So what about the letters ? ”
101226	101236	101219	101219	His	1697	“ They were simply a means to an end . ”
101237	101254	101261	101261	he	1697	“ Were they real ? All those dirty , naughty things they wrote to each other ? ”
101255	101260	101261	101261	he	1697	“ They were real , ”
101265	101272	101316	101316	He	1697	“ Just not in this house . ”
101273	101315	101316	101316	He	1697	“ I ’m glad . I like to think that those two were crazy in love for so long and that they eventually get together . They do , do n’t they ? Get together and have a happy ever after ? ”
101319	101327	101328	101328	She	58	“ I did n’t read far enough . ”
101336	101363	101372	101372	he	1697	“ I like to think that they did . I feel like their story is ours , just a little . Two lovers separated and reunited . ”
101364	101371	101372	101372	he	1697	“ Their story ’s not ours , ”
101390	101405	101415	101415	she	58	“ I want us to make our story , not follow someone else ’s . ”
101431	101440	101457	101457	His	1697	“ You hurt me bad , you know . ”
101441	101456	101457	101457	His	1697	“ I ’m changing . For you , I ’ll change everything I am . ”
101465	101492	101511	101511	His	1697	“ I meant it , Gretchen . I love you . It does n’t matter to me if you love me or not . Just stay . ”
101493	101510	101515	101515	He	1697	“ Well , it ’s a good thing for you that I love you , too . ”
101523	101529	101530	101530	She	58	“ Do you mean it ? ”
101537	101566	101571	101571	his	1697	“ We ’re going to have to get past this trust thing . Of course I mean it . Why would I lie to you after all this ? ”
101574	101585	101653	101653	she	58	“ I just never thought I would be so lucky . ”
101641	101652	101653	101653	she	58	“ You want to see how lucky you can be ? ”
101658	101661	101729	101729	Hunter	57	“ Always . ”
101720	101728	101729	101729	Hunter	57	“ Tell me I am not dreaming , ”
101739	101752	101762	101762	she	58	“ That you ’re truly in my arms and I ’m forgiven . ”
101753	101761	101762	101762	she	58	“ I ’ll just pinch you instead , ”
101778	101786	101793	101793	He	1697	“ Got a preference as to where ? ”
101787	101792	101826	101826	She	58	“ Do n’t care . ”
101815	101825	101896	101896	Gretchen	58	“ I want you , Gretchen . So badly . ”
101907	101932	102034	102034	She	58	“ Kind of a shame that this is occupied . I can think of some naughty uses for such a nice , flat surface . ”
102039	102054	102127	102127	He	57	“ You ’re ruining your jacket . I think it needs to come off . ”
102113	102126	102162	102162	he	57	“ My , you ’re quite responsive today , are n’t you ? ”
102155	102161	102162	102162	he	57	“ You ’re ruining these , ”
102172	102181	102200	102200	she	58	“ I think they need to come off . ”
102192	102199	102209	102209	she	58	“ How quickly the tables turn , ”
102225	102242	102247	102247	His	57	“ If I take them off , are you going to fuck me on this table ? ”
102243	102246	102247	102247	His	57	“ Yes . ”
102251	102259	102264	102264	she	58	“ And it wo n’t be polite . ”
102273	102276	102288	102288	he	57	“ No ? ”
102277	102287	102288	102288	he	57	“ It ’s going to be hard and rough , ”
102310	102321	102328	102328	she	58	“ You ’ll probably scream my name a few times . ”
