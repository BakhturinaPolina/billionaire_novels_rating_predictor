923	940	941	941	I	0	anywayâ€”Iâ€ ™ ve watched horror movies , thank you very much . I only had one option leftâ€”one
948	983	1099	1099	my	0	takeâ€”but beggars couldnâ€ ™ t be choosers . I pulled up the contact in my phone , said a silent prayer , and pressed the call button . One ring . Two rings . Three .
1001	1098	1099	1099	my	0	worseâ€”getting murdered or dealing with my brother . Of course , there was always the chance said brother would murder me himself for putting myself in such a situation , but Iâ€ ™ d deal with that later . â€œWhatâ€ ™ s wrong?â€ I scrunched my nose at his greeting . â€œHello to you too , brother dearest . What makes you think something is wrong?â€ Josh snorted . â€œUh , you called me . You never call unless youâ€ ™ re in trouble.â€ True . We preferred texting , and we lived next door to each otherâ€”not
1104	1338	1099	1099	my	0	wayâ€”so we rarely had to message at all . â€œI wouldnâ€ ™ t say Iâ€ ™ m in trouble , â€ I hedged . â€œMore likeâ€ ¦ stranded . Iâ€ ™ m not near public transport , and I canâ€ ™ t find an Uber.â€ â€œChrist , Ava . Where are you?â€ I told him . â€œWhat the hell are you doing there ? Thatâ€ ™ s an hour from campus!â€ â€œDonâ€ ™ t be dramatic . I had an engagement shoot , and itâ€ ™ s a thirty - minute drive . Forty - five if thereâ€ ™ s traffic.â€ Thunder boomed , shaking the branches of nearby trees . I winced and shrank farther back into the shelter , not that it did me much good . The rain slanted sideways , splattering me with water droplets so heavy and hard they stung when they hit my skin . A rustling noise came from Joshâ€ ™ s end , followed by a soft moan . I paused , sure Iâ€ ™ d heard wrong , but nope , there it was again . Another moan . My eyes widened in horror . â€œAre you having sex right now?â€ I whisper - shouted , even though no one else was around . The sandwich Iâ€ ™ d scarfed down before I left for my shoot threatened to make a reappearance . There was nothingâ€”I
1340	1580	1099	1099	my	0	nothingâ€”grosser than listening to a relative while theyâ€ ™ re mid - coitus . Just the thought made me gag . â€œTechnically , no.â€ Josh sounded unrepentant . The word â€œtechnicallyâ€ did a lot of heavy lifting there . It didnâ€ ™ t take a genius to decipher Joshâ€ ™ s vague reply . He may not be having intercourse , but something was going on , and I had zero desire to find out what that â€œsomethingâ€ was . â€œJosh Chen.â€ â€œHey , youâ€ ™ re the one who called me.â€ He mustâ€ ™ ve covered his phone with his hand , because his next words came through muffled . I heard a soft , feminine laugh followed by a squeal , and I wanted to bleach my ears , my eyes , my mind . â€œOne of the guys took my car to buy more ice , â€ Josh said , his voice clear again . â€œBut donâ€ ™ t worry , I got you . Drop a pin on your exact location and keep your phone close . Do you still have the pepper spray I bought for your birthday last year?â€ â€œYes . Thanks for that , by the way.â€ Iâ€ ™ d wanted a new camera bag , but Josh had bought me an eight - pack of pepper spray instead . Iâ€ ™ d never used any of it , which meant all eight bottlesâ€”minus
1586	1677	1681	1681	you	398	purseâ€”were sitting snug in the back of my closet . My sarcasm went over my brotherâ€ ™ s head . For a straight - A pre - med student , he could be quite dense . â€œYouâ€ ™ re welcome . Stay put , and heâ€ ™ ll be there soon . Weâ€ ™ ll talk about your complete lack of self - preservation later.â€ â€œIâ€ ™ m self - preserved , â€ I protested . Was that the right word ? â€œItâ€ ™ s not my fault there are no Ubâ€”wait

1855	1958	1849	1849	Heâ€	111	Popularâ€”basketball player , student body president , and homecoming king in high school ; Sigma fraternity brother and Big Man on Campus in college . I was his opposite . Not un popular per se , but I shied away from the limelight and would rather have a small group of close friends than a large group of friendly acquaintances . Where Josh was the life of the party , I sat in the corner and daydreamed about all the places I would love to visit but would probably never get to . Not if my phobia had anything to do with it .
2198	2332	2179	2179	Josh	106	itâ€”especially when the situation involved me . The bright beam of headlights slashed through the rain . I squinted , my heart tripping in both anticipation and wariness as I weighed the odds of whether the car belonged to my ride or a potential psycho . This part of Maryland was pretty safe , but you never knew . When my eyes adjusted to the light , I slumped with relief , only to stiffen again two seconds later . Good news ? I recognized the sleek , black Aston Martin pulling up toward me . It belonged to one of Joshâ€ ™ s friends , which meant I wouldnâ€ ™ t end up a local news item tonight . Bad news ? The person driving said Aston Martin was the last person I wantedâ€”or
2333	2453	2186	2186	he	106	expectedâ€”to pick me up . He wasnâ€ ™ t an Iâ€ ™ ll do my buddy a favor and rescue his stranded little sister kinda guy . He was a look at me wrong and Iâ€ ™ ll destroy you and everyone you care about kinda guy , and heâ€ ™ d do it looking so calm and gorgeous you wouldnâ€ ™ t notice your world burning down around you until you were already a heap of ashes at his Tom Ford - clad feet . I swiped the tip of my tongue over my dry lips as the car stopped in front of me and the passenger window rolled down . â€œGet in.â€ He didnâ€ ™ t raise his voiceâ€”he
2457	2525	2186	2186	he	106	voiceâ€”but I still heard him loud and clear over the rain . Alex Volkov was a force of nature unto himself , and I imagined even the weather bowed to him . â€œI hope youâ€ ™ re not waiting for me to open the door for you , â€ he said when I didnâ€ ™ t move . He sounded as happy as I was about the situation .
2665	2950	2654	2654	He	98	breathedâ€”steady and controlled , with an undercurrent of danger warning those foolish enough to contemplate crossing him that doing so would be their death sentence . He was the exact opposite of Josh , and I still marveled at the fact that they were best friends . Personally , I thought Alex was an asshole . I was sure he had his reasons , some kind of psychological trauma which shaped him into the unfeeling robot he was today . Based on the snippets Iâ€ ™ d gleaned from Josh , Alexâ€ ™ s childhood had been even worse than ours , though Iâ€ ™ d never managed to pull the details out of my brother . All I knew was , Alexâ€ ™ s parents had died when he was young and left him a pile of money heâ€ ™ d quadrupled the value of when he came into his inheritance at age eighteen . Not that heâ€ ™ d needed it because heâ€ ™ d invented a new financial modeling software in high school that made him a multimillionaire before he could vote . With an IQ of 160 , Alex Volkov was a genius , or close to it . He was the only person in Thayerâ€ ™ s history to complete its five - year joint undergrad / MBA program in three years , and at age twenty - six , he was the COO of one of the most successful real estate development companies in the country . He was a legend , and he knew it . Meanwhile , I thought I was doing well if I remembered to eat while juggling my classes , extracurriculars , and two jobsâ€”front

3361	3491	3561	3562	Alex Volkov	98	soâ€”â€ â€œStop.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s fingers curled around the steering wheel , and my crazy , hormonal mind latched onto how beautiful they were . That might sound crazy because who has beautiful fingers ? But he did . Physically , everything about him was beautiful . The jade - green eyes that glared out from beneath dark brows like chips hewn from a glacier ; the sharp jawline and elegant , sculpted cheekbones ; the lean frame and thick , light brown hair that somehow looked both tousled and perfectly coiffed . He resembled a statue in an Italian museum come to life . The insane urge to ruffle his hair like I would a kidâ€ ™ s gripped me , just so heâ€ ™ d stop looking so perfectâ€”which
3501	3553	3561	3562	Alex Volkov	98	mortalsâ€”but I didnâ€ ™ t have a death wish , so I kept my hands planted in my lap . â€œIf I take you to Crumble & Bake , will you stop talking?â€ No doubt he regretted picking me up . My smile grew . â€œIf you want.â€ His lips thinned . â€œFine.â€
3609	3757	3604	3604	his	98	coldâ€”it was scorching , and it burned through my skin and muscles until I felt its warmth in the pit of my stomach . I swallowed hard . Stupid hormones . â€œWhat ? Weâ€ ™ re already late , and theyâ€ ™ re closing soon.â€ â€œYou canâ€ ™ t go out like that.â€ The tiniest hint of disapproval etched into the corners of his mouth . â€œLike what?â€ I asked , confused . I wore jeans and a T - shirt , nothing scandalous . Alex inclined his head toward my chest . I glanced down and let out a horrified yelp . Because my shirt ? White . Wet . Transparent . Not even a little transparent , like you could kind of see my bra outline if you looked hard enough . This was full - on see - through . Red lace bra , hard nipplesâ€”thanks
3761	4051	3604	3604	his	98	conditioningâ€”the whole shebang . I crossed my arms over my chest , my face flaming the same color as my bra . â€œWas it like this the entire time?â€ â€œYes.â€ â€œYou couldâ€ ™ ve told me.â€ â€œI did tell you . Just now.â€ Sometimes , I wanted to strangle him . I really did . And I wasnâ€ ™ t even a violent person . I was the same girl who didnâ€ ™ t eat gingerbread man cookies for years after watching Shrek because I felt like I was eating Gingyâ€ ™ s family members or , worse , Gingy himself , but something about Alex provoked my dark side . I exhaled a sharp breath and dropped my arms by instinct , forgetting about my see - through shirt until Alexâ€ ™ s gaze flicked down to my chest again . The flaming cheeks returned , but I was sick of sitting here arguing with him . Crumble & Bake closed in ten minutes , and the clock was ticking . Maybe it was the man , the weather , or the hour and a half Iâ€ ™ d spent stuck under a bus shelter , but my frustration spilled out before I could stop it . â€œInstead of being an asshole and staring at my breasts , can you lend me your jacket ? Because I really want to get this cake and send my brother , your best friend , off in style before he leaves the country.â€ My words hung in the air while I clapped a hand over my mouth , horrified . Did I just utter the word â€œbreastsâ€ to Alex Volkov and accuse him of ogling me ? And call him an asshole ?
4545	4848	4882	4883	The blonde	447	inâ€”â€ â€œSpare me the details . I donâ€ ™ t care.â€ A low growl slipped from my throat . â€œWhy are you here ? Didnâ€ ™ t figure you for the chauffeur type.â€ â€œI was in the area , and youâ€ ™ re Joshâ€ ™ s little sister . If you died , heâ€ ™ d be a bore to hang out with.â€ Alex pulled up in front of my house . Next door , AKA at Joshâ€ ™ s house , the lights blazed , and I could see people dancing and laughing through the windows . â€œJosh has the worst taste in friends , â€ I bit out . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what he sees in you . I hope that stick in your ass punctures a vital organ.â€ Then , because Iâ€ ™ d been raised with manners , I added , â€œThank you for the ride.â€ I huffed out of the car . The rain had slowed to a drizzle , and I smelled damp earth and the hydrangeas clustered in a pot by the front door . Iâ€ ™ d shower , change , then catch the last half of Joshâ€ ™ s party . Hopefully , he wouldnâ€ ™ t give me shit for getting stranded or being late because I wasnâ€ ™ t in the mood . I never stay angry for long , but right then , my blood simmered and I wanted to punch Alex Volkov in the face . He was so cold and arrogant andâ€ ¦ andâ€ ¦ him . It was infuriating . At least I didnâ€ ™ t have to deal with him often . Josh usually hung out with him in the city , and Alex didnâ€ ™ t visit Thayer even though he was an alumnus .
4917	4942	4898	4898	she	447	curvedâ€”not enough to classify as a smile , but enough to broadcast my thoughts . You canâ€ ™ t handle what Iâ€ ™ m into .
5410	5427	5428	5428	he	106	friendâ€”one of the few people whose company I could stand for more than an hour at a timeâ€”and
5566	5569	5543	5543	she	2581	laughsâ€”hell , most peopleâ€”were
5725	6102	5703	5703	Josh	106	nowhereâ€”wait , nope . There they were , dancing to BeyoncÃ © like they were auditioning for a gig at The Strip Angel while a circle of guys watched them with their tongues lolling out . Men . My gender could use a little more standards and a little less thinking with their small head . â€œThanks for showing up , man . Sorry I havenâ€ ™ t said hi till now . Iâ€ ™ ve beenâ€ ¦ busy.â€ â€œI saw.â€ I arched an eyebrow at the lipstick print smeared on the corner of his mouth . â€œYou have a little something on your face.â€ His grin widened . â€œBadge of honor . Speaking of which , Iâ€ ™ m not interrupting , am I?â€ I glanced at the blonde and brunette , whoâ€ ™ d moved on to making out with each other after failing to capture my interest . â€œNo.â€ I shook my head . â€œA hundred bucks says you wonâ€ ™ t survive the full year in Bumfuck , Nowhere . No women , no parties . Youâ€ ™ ll be back before Halloween.â€ â€œOh , ye of little faith . Thereâ€ ™ ll be women , and the party is wherever I am.â€ Josh swiped an unopened beer from a nearby cooler and cracked it open . â€œI actually wanted to talk to you about that . Me being gone , â€ he clarified . â€œDonâ€ ™ t tell me youâ€ ™ re getting sentimental on me . If you bought us friendship bracelets , Iâ€ ™ m out.â€ â€œFuck you , dude.â€ He laughed . â€œI wouldnâ€ ™ t buy your ass jewelry if you paid me . No , this is about Ava.â€ My glass paused an inch from my lips before I brought it home and the sweet burn of whiskey flowed down my throat . I hate beer . It tastes like piss , but since it was the drink du jour at Joshâ€ ™ s parties , I always brought a flask of Macallan whenever I visited . â€œWhat about her?â€ Josh and his sister were close , even if they bickered so much I wanted to duct tape their mouths sometimes . That was the nature of siblingsâ€”something
6162	6183	6144	6144	his	106	herselfâ€”unless sheâ€ ™ s getting stranded in the middle of fucking nowhere ; thanks for picking her up , by the wayâ€”but
6393	6404	6405	6405	she	478	askâ€”I know youâ€ ™ ve got a lot of shit going onâ€”but
6452	6564	6405	6405	she	478	herâ€”just to make sure she doesnâ€ ™ t get killed or kidnapped or anything ? Iâ€ ™ d owe you big.â€ â€œYou already owe me for all those times I saved your ass , â€ I said wryly . â€œYou had fun while doing it . Youâ€ ™ re too uptight sometimes.â€ Josh grinned . â€œSo , is that a yes?â€ I glanced at Ava again . Took her in . She was twenty - two , four years younger than Josh and me , and she managed to appear both younger and older than her years . It was the way she carried herself , like sheâ€ ™ d seen it allâ€”the
6572	6635	6435	6435	she	478	uglyâ€”and still believed in goodness . It was as stupid as it was admirable . She mustâ€ ™ ve felt me staring because she paused her conversation and looked directly at me , her cheeks tinting pink at my unflinching gaze . Sheâ€ ™ d changed out of her jeans and T - shirt into a purple dress that swirled around her knees .
6730	6851	6722	6722	my	0	” I yanked myself out of that startling fantasy fast . What the fuck was wrong with me ? That was Joshâ€ ™ s sister . Innocent , doe - eyed , and so sweet I could throw up . The total opposite of the sophisticated , jaded women I preferred both in and out of bed . I didnâ€ ™ t have to worry about feelings with the latter ; they knew better than to develop any around me . Ava was nothing but feelings , with a hint of sass . A ghost of a smile passed over my mouth when I remembered her parting shot earlier . I hope that stick in your ass punctures a vital organ .
6982	7287	6981	6981	you	0	knowâ€”â€ â€œFuck her?â€ â€œJesus , dude.â€ Josh looked like heâ€ ™ d swallowed a lemon . â€œDonâ€ ™ t use that word in relation to my sister . Itâ€ ™ s gross . Butâ€ ¦ yeah . I mean , we both know sheâ€ ™ s not your type , and even if she was , youâ€ ™ d never go there.â€ A sliver of guilt flashed through me when I remembered my errant fantasy a few moments ago . It was time for me to call up someone from my roster if I was fantasizing about Ava Chen , of all people . â€œBut itâ€ ™ s more than that , â€ Josh continued . â€œYouâ€ ™ re the only person I trust , period , outside of my family . And you know how worried I am about Ava , especially considering this whole thing with her ex.â€ His face darkened . â€œI swear , if I ever see that fuckerâ€ ¦ â€ I sighed . â€œIâ€ ™ ll take care of her . Donâ€ ™ t worry.â€ I was going to regret this . I knew it , yet here I was , signing my life away , at least for the next year . I didnâ€ ™ t make a lot of promises , but when I did , I kept them . Committed myself to them . Which meant if I promised Josh Iâ€ ™ d look after Ava , Iâ€ ™ d fucking look after her , and Iâ€ ™ m not talking about a text check - in every two weeks . She was under my protection now . A familiar , creeping sense of doom slithered around my neck and squeezed , tighter and tighter , until oxygen ran scarce and tiny lights danced before my eyes .
7310	7324	6981	6981	you	0	muchâ€”the one sheâ€ ™ d brought back from Europe on her last trip abroad .
7373	7406	7411	7411	they	492	roomâ€”a room which , not half an hour earlier , had burst with warmth and laughter and love . Now it was cold and lifeless , like the three bodies at my feet .
7412	7508	7411	7411	they	492	disappearedâ€”the lights , the memories , the noose around my neck . But theyâ€ ™ d come back . They always did . â€œâ€ ¦ Youâ€ ™ re the best , â€ Josh was saying , his grin back now that Iâ€ ™ d agreed to take on a role I had no business taking . I wasnâ€ ™ t a protector ; I was a destroyer . I broke hearts , crushed business opponents , and didnâ€ ™ t care about the aftermath . If someone was stupid enough to fall for me or cross meâ€”two
7517	7527	7510	7510	I	0	doâ€”they had it coming . â€œIâ€ ™ ll bring you backâ€”fuck
7645	7738	7637	7637	they	499	â€œÐ”ÑÐ´ÑŒÐºÐ¾,â€ I said , using the Ukrainian term for uncle . â€œAlex.â€ My uncleâ€ ™ s voice rasped over the line , scratchy from decades of cigarettes and the wear and tear of life . â€œI hope Iâ€ ™ m not interrupting.â€ â€œNo.â€ I glanced through the sliding glass door at the revelry inside . Josh had lived in the same rambling , two - story house off Thayerâ€ ™ s campus since undergrad . Weâ€ ™ d roomed together until I graduated and moved to D.C. proper to be closer to my officeâ€”and
8019	8042	8012	8012	Iâ€	106	elseâ€”the chess - play of corporate politics , the fleeting pleasure of burying myself into the tight , warm heat of a willing bodyâ€”theyâ€
8447	8612	8439	8439	I	0	developmentsâ€”my promise to Josh , my uncleâ€ ™ s nudge about the minor hiccup in my revenge plan . Somehow , I had to reconcile the two over the next year . I mentally rearranged the pieces of my life into different patterns , playing each scenario out to the end , weighing the pros and cons , and examining them for potential cracks until I reached a decision . â€œEverything good?â€ Josh called out from the couch , where the blonde kissed his neck while the brunetteâ€ ™ s hands became intimately acquainted with the region below his belt . â€œYes.â€ To my irritation , my gaze strayed toward Ava again . She was in the kitchen , fussing over the half - eaten cake from Crumble & Bake . Her tanned skin glowed with a faint sheen of sweat from dancing , and her raven hair billowed around her face in a soft cloud . â€œAbout your earlier requestâ€ ¦ I have an idea.â€
8883	8888	8866	8866	I	0	oneâ€”not even supermodels or movie starsâ€”was
8910	9353	9355	9355	I	0	metâ€”aside from my brother , whose ego was so large it could house the entire East Coast of the United States with room left over for Texas . I suppose he had reason to be , considering heâ€ ™ d always been the golden boy , and though it pained me to admit it because he was my brother , he wasnâ€ ™ t bad - looking either . Six - foot - two with thick black hair and razor - sharp bone structure , which he never let anyone forget . I was convinced Josh would commission a sculpture of himself and display it on his front lawn if he could . Jules and Josh never divulged why they disliked each other so much , but I suspected it might be because they saw too much of themselves in each other . The front door was already open , so we didnâ€ ™ t bother knocking . To my surprise , the house was pretty clean . Josh had put most of his furniture into storage last week , and the only things left to pack were the couch ( which someone would pick up later ) , a few stray kitchen items , and the weird abstract painting in the living room . â€œJosh?â€ My voice echoed in the large , empty space while Jules sat on the ground and pulled her knees to her chest with a grumpy expression . If you couldnâ€ ™ t tell , she wasnâ€ ™ t a morning person . â€œWhere are you?â€ â€œBedroom!â€ I heard a loud thump upstairs , followed by a muffled curse . A minute later , Josh came down holding a large cardboard box . â€œShit Iâ€ ™ m donating , â€ he explained , setting it on the kitchen counter . I wrinkled my nose . â€œPut a shirt on . Please.â€ â€œAnd deprive JR of her morning eye candy?â€ Josh smirked . â€œIâ€ ™ m not that cruel.â€ I wasnâ€ ™ t the only one who thought Jules looked like Jessica Rabbit ; Josh always called her by the cartoon characterâ€ ™ s initials , which pissed her off to no end . Then again , everything Josh did pissed her off . Jules lifted her head and scowled . â€œPlease . Iâ€ ™ ve seen better abs at the campus gym . Listen to Ava and put a shirt on before I lose last nightâ€ ™ s dinner.â€ â€œMethinks the lady doth protest too much , â€ Josh drawled , slapping a hand against his six - pack . â€œThe only thing youâ€ ™ ll be losing isâ€”â€
9809	10391	9792	9792	I	0	compâ€”youâ€ ™ re not moving here . â€ â€œActually , he is.â€ Josh slung an arm over my shoulder , his eyes twinkling with mischief . â€œMeet your new neighbor , little sis.â€ My eyes ping - ponged between him and Alex , who couldnâ€ ™ t look more bored by the conversation . â€œNo.â€ There was only one reason Alex Volkov would leave his cushy D.C. penthouse and move back to Hazelburg , and Iâ€ ™ d bet my new camera it had nothing to do with nostalgia for his college days . â€œNo , no , no , no , no.â€ â€œYes , yes , yes , yes , yes.â€ I glared at my brother . â€œI donâ€ ™ t need a babysitter . Iâ€ ™ m twenty - two years old.â€ â€œWho said anything about babysitting?â€ Josh shrugged . â€œHeâ€ ™ s looking after the house for me . Iâ€ ™ m moving back in when I return next year , so it makes sense.â€ â€œBullshit . You want him to keep an eye on me.â€ â€œThatâ€ ™ s a bonus.â€ Joshâ€ ™ s face softened . â€œIt doesnâ€ ™ t hurt to have someone you can rely on when Iâ€ ™ m not here , especially given this whole thing with Liam.â€ I winced at the mention of my ex . Liam had been blowing up my phone since I caught him cheating on me a month and a half ago . Heâ€ ™ d even shown up at the gallery where I worked a few times , begging for another chance . I wasnâ€ ™ t devastated by our breakup . Weâ€ ™ d dated for a few months , and I hadnâ€ ™ t been in love with him or anything , but the situation had brought all my insecurities to the surface . Josh worried about Liam getting out of hand , but letâ€ ™ s be honest , Liam was a Brooks - Brother - wearing , polo - playing trust fund baby . I doubted heâ€ ™ d do anything that would mess up his perfectly gelled hair . I was more embarrassed Iâ€ ™ d dated him than concerned about my physical safety . â€œI can handle myself.â€ I pulled Joshâ€ ™ s arm off my shoulder . â€œCall the moving company and cancel , â€ I told Alex , whoâ€ ™ d been ignoring us and scrolling through his phone this whole time . â€œYou do not need to move here . Donâ€ ™ t you haveâ€ ¦ stuff to do in D.C.?â€ â€œD.C. is a twenty - minute drive , â€ he said without looking up . â€œFor the record , I am totally in favor of you moving in next door , â€ Jules piped up . Traitor . â€œDo you mow the lawn shirtless ? If not , I highly recommend it.â€ Alex and Josh frowned at the same time . â€œYou.â€ Josh pointed at her . â€œDo not pull any of your shenanigans while Iâ€ ™ m gone.â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s cute how you think you have a say in my life.â€ â€œI donâ€ ™ t give a shit what you do with your life . Itâ€ ™ s when you drag Ava into your harebrained schemes Iâ€ ™ m concerned.â€ â€œNewsflash : you donâ€ ™ t have a say in Avaâ€ ™ s life either . Sheâ€ ™ s her own person.â€ â€œSheâ€ ™ s my sisterâ€”â€

10416	10572	9792	9792	I	0	agoâ€”â€ â€œPeople!â€ I pressed my fingers to my temple . Dealing with Josh and Jules was like dealing with children . â€œStop arguing . Josh , stop trying to control my life . Jules , stop provoking him.â€ Josh crossed his arms over his chest . â€œAs your big brother , itâ€ ™ s my job to protect you and to appoint someone to fill in for me when Iâ€ ™ m not here.â€ I grew up with him ; I recognized that look on his face . He wasnâ€ ™ t budging . â€œI assume Alex is the fill - in?â€ I asked in a resigned tone . â€œIâ€ ™ m not a â€˜fill - inâ€ ™ anything , â€ Alex said icily . â€œDonâ€ ™ t do anything stupid , and weâ€ ™ ll be fine.â€ I groaned and covered my face with my hands . This was going to be a long year .
11035	11201	11220	11220	Alex	103	outfitâ€”white Thomas Pink shirt , Armani pants and shoes , blue Brioni tie . His eyes roved over my hair ( tossed up into a bun ) , my face ( hot as sun - scorched sand for no discernible reason ) , and my clothes ( my favorite tank and shorts set ) before settling on the basket . His expression remained unreadable the entire time . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re for you.â€ I shoved the basket toward him . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re cookies , â€ I added unnecessarily , because duh , he had eyes and could see for himself that they were cookies . â€œItâ€ ™ s a welcome - to - the - neighborhood gift.â€ â€œA welcome - to - the - neighborhood gift , â€ he repeated . â€œYep . Since youâ€ ™ reâ€ ¦ new . To the neighborhood.â€ I sounded like an idiot . â€œI know you donâ€ ™ t want to be here any more than I want you hereâ€”â€
11244	11839	11884	11884	he	575	butâ€”â€ I blew out a frustrated breath . He had to make this difficult . â€œIâ€ ™ m trying to be nice , okay ? Weâ€ ™ re stuck with each other for the next year , so I want to make our lives easier . Just take the damn cookies . You can eat them , throw them out , feed them to your pet snake Nagini , whatever.â€ His mouth twitched . â€œDid you just compare me to Voldemort?â€ â€œWhat ? No!â€ Maybe . â€œI used the snake as an example . You donâ€ ™ t seem like the type whoâ€ ™ d have a furry pet.â€ â€œYouâ€ ™ re right on that account . But I donâ€ ™ t have a snake , either.â€ He took the basket off my hands . â€œThank you.â€ I blinked . Blinked again . Did Alex Volkov thank me ? Iâ€ ™ d expected him to take the cookies and shut the door in my face . Heâ€ ™ d never thanked me for anything in my life . Except maybe that one time I passed him the mashed potatoes at dinner , but Iâ€ ™ d been drunk , so my recollection was hazy . I was still frozen in shock when he added , â€œDo you want to come in?â€ This was a dream . It had to be . Because the chances of Alex inviting me inside his house in real life were lower than me solving a quadratic equation in my head . I pinched myself . Ow . Okay , not a dream . Just an incredibly surreal encounter . I wondered if aliens had abducted the real Alex on his way home and replaced him with a nicer , more civil imposter . â€œSure , â€ I managed , because hell , I was curious . Iâ€ ™ d never been inside Alexâ€ ™ s home before , and I was curious to see what heâ€ ™ d done with Joshâ€ ™ s place . Heâ€ ™ d moved in two days ago , so I expected to see stray boxes lying about , but everything was so polished and put together it looked like heâ€ ™ d been living here for years . A sleek gray couch and eighty - inch flat - screen TV dominated the living room , accented with a low , white lacquered coffee table , industrial - chic lamps , and Joshâ€ ™ s abstract painting . I glimpsed an espresso machine in the kitchen and a glass - topped table with white - cushioned chairs in the dining room , but otherwise , there wasnâ€ ™ t much furniture to speak of . It was a drastic difference from Joshâ€ ™ s messy but cozy collection of random books , sports equipment , and items heâ€ ™ d collected from his travels . â€œYouâ€ ™ re a minimalist , huh?â€ I examined a strange metal sculpture that looked like an exploding brain but probably cost more than my monthly rent . â€œI donâ€ ™ t see a point in collecting items I donâ€ ™ t use and donâ€ ™ t enjoy.â€ Alex placed the cookies on the coffee table and walked to the bar cart in the corner . â€œDrink?â€ â€œNo , thanks.â€ I sat on the couch , unsure of what to do or say . He poured himself a glass of whiskey and sat opposite me , but it wasnâ€ ™ t far enough . I caught a whiff of his cologneâ€”something
11957	12289	11934	11934	I	0	effectsâ€”nothing that showed I was in an actual home and not a model showroom . â€œWhy would I need photos?â€ I couldnâ€ ™ t tell if he was joking or not . Probably not . Alex didnâ€ ™ t joke , except for that one blip in his car a few days ago . â€œFor the memories , â€ I said , like I was explaining a simple concept to a toddler . â€œTo remember people and events?â€ â€œI donâ€ ™ t need photos for that . The memories are here.â€ Alex tapped the side of his forehead . â€œEveryoneâ€ ™ s memories fade . Photos donâ€ ™ t.â€ At least , not digital ones . â€œNot mine.â€ He set his empty glass on the coffee table , his eyes dark . â€œI have a superior memory.â€ My snort slipped out before I could stop it . â€œSomeone has a high opinion of himself.â€ That earned me a shadow of a smirk . â€œIâ€ ™ m not bragging . I have hyperthymesia , or HSAM . Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory . Look it up.â€ I paused . That , I hadnâ€ ™ t expected . â€œYou have a photographic memory?â€ â€œNo , theyâ€ ™ re different . People with photographic memory recall details from a scene theyâ€ ™ ve observed for a short time . People with HSAM remember almost everything about their life . Every conversation , every detail , every emotion.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s jade eyes morphed into emeralds , dark and haunted . â€œWhether or not they want to.â€ â€œJosh never mentioned this.â€ Not once , not a hint , and theyâ€ ™ d been friends for close to a decade . â€œJosh doesnâ€ ™ t tell you everything.â€ Iâ€ ™ d never heard of hyperthymesia . It sounded fantastical , like something out of a science fiction movie , but I heard the truth in Alexâ€ ™ s voice . What would it be like to remember everything ?
13054	13140	13162	13162	He	598	thoughâ€”no overtime . Thereâ€ ™ s a new class coming in.â€ I raised my eyebrows . â€œClass?â€ The KM Academy catered toward intermediate to advanced practitioners and specialized in one - on - one or small group sessions . It didnâ€ ™ t host large classes the way most other centers did . Ralph shrugged . â€œYeah . Weâ€ ™ re opening the center up to beginners . Just one class for now , see how it goes . Missy bugged me about it until I agreedâ€”said
13341	13345	13333	13333	Ava	99	â€œtruceâ€â€”her word , not mineâ€”since
13414	13442	13393	13393	Iâ€	106	systemâ€”sheâ€ ™ d thrown a fit when the security company woke her up at seven in the morning to install the new system , but she got over itâ€”whatever
13653	13694	13637	13637	Ralph	316	dayâ€”if youâ€ ™ re lucky.â€ I smirked . â€œFuck you . I can already beat you if I want.â€ Iâ€ ™ d come close to doing it once , but part of me liked the fact I wasnâ€ ™ t the bestâ€”yet
13861	13867	13848	13848	I	0	phoneâ€”something I told her never to doâ€”or
13914	13924	13886	13886	My	0	memoryâ€”that of me attending my first Krav Maga lesson at sixteenâ€”until
14524	14563	14523	14525	A photoâ€”â€ â€œItâ€	2688	photoâ€”â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s been almost an hour , â€ I snapped . Jules shrugged . â€œMaybe sheâ€ ™ s having sex.â€ A muscle jumped in my jaw . I wasnâ€ ™ t sure which version of Jules was worseâ€”the
14774	14824	14752	14752	he	642	whoâ€”â€ I shouldered my way past him , which wasnâ€ ™ t hard considering he weighed a hundred sixty , tops . â€œHey , you canâ€ ™ t go up there!â€ he yelled . â€œTheyâ€ ™ re in the middle of something.â€ Fuck . That . If Ava was having sexâ€”a
14833	14947	14752	14752	he	642	thoughtâ€”that was all the more reason for an interruption . Horny college guys were some of the most dangerous creatures in existence . I wondered if sheâ€ ™ d gotten back together with her ex . Josh mentioned the weasel had cheated on her , and she didnâ€ ™ t seem like the type whoâ€ ™ d crawl back to someone after they treated her terribly , but I wouldnâ€ ™ t put anything past Miss Sunshine and Roses . That bleeding heart of hers would land her in a heap of trouble one day . Once I reached the second floor , I didnâ€ ™ t need to guess what room she was inâ€”I
15312	15325	15345	15345	she	99	lustâ€”she was my best friendâ€ ™ s sister , for fuckâ€ ™ s sakeâ€”and
15741	15804	15805	15805	She	99	portâ€”what are you doing?â€ He squawked in protest when I snatched the camera out of his hands and started deleting photos but fell silent when I leveled him with a death glare . â€œStop ! Youâ€ ™ re being ridiculous.â€ Ava tried to retrieve the camera , to no avail . â€œDo you know how long those photos took ? Stop . You areâ€”â€
15817	16772	15805	15805	She	99	â€œBeingâ€”â€ Another yank , same result . â€œUnreasonable!â€ â€œIâ€ ™ m protecting you , since you clearly canâ€ ™ t do it yourself.â€ My mood darkened further when I saw the pictures of her lying on the bed , staring sultrily at the camera . How long had she and Blondie been doing this , alone ? It didnâ€ ™ t take a genius to figure out what had been going through his mind the entire time . It was the same thing that wouldâ€ ™ ve gone through any red - blooded maleâ€ ™ s mind . Sex . I hoped Blondie enjoyed his working pair of eyes while he still had them . Ava stepped back for a minute , then lunged for the camera in a poorly concealed attempt to catch me off guard . Iâ€ ™ d expected the move , but I still grunted at the impact as she scrambled over me like a fucking spider monkey . Her breasts grazed my arm , and her hair tickled my skin . My blood heated at the sensations . She was so close I could hear her breath coming out in soft pants . I tried not to notice how her chest heaved or how smooth her skin felt pressed against mine . They were dangerous , twisting thoughts that had no place in my mind . Not now , not ever . â€œGive it back , â€ she ordered . It was almost cute how she thought she could order me around . â€œNo.â€ Ava narrowed her eyes . â€œIf you donâ€ ™ t give it back , I swear to God Iâ€ ™ ll walk out into the street wearing this outfit.â€ Another bolt of fury sizzled through me . â€œYou wouldnâ€ ™ t.â€ â€œTry me.â€ Our faces were inches apart , our words so soft no one could hear them except us . Nevertheless , I lowered my head so I could whisper right in her ear . â€œIf you step a foot outside this room in that outfit , Iâ€ ™ ll not only delete every picture on this camera , but I will destroy your â€˜friendâ€ ™ sâ€ ™ career until he has to resort to advertising shitty five - dollar - an - hour headshots on Craigslist.â€ A wintry smile touched my lips . â€œYou wouldnâ€ ™ t want that , would you?â€ There are two ways to threaten people : attack them directly , or attack those they care about . I wasnâ€ ™ t above doing either . Avaâ€ ™ s mouth trembled . She believed me , as she should , because I meant every word . I wasnâ€ ™ t a senator or a lobbyist , but an obscene net worth , thick files of blackmail material , and years of networking had granted me more than my fair share of influence in D.C. â€œYouâ€ ™ re an asshole.â€ â€œYes , I am , and donâ€ ™ t you forget it.â€ I straightened . â€œGet dressed.â€ Ava didnâ€ ™ t argue , but she also refused to look at me as she disappeared into the bathroom across the hall to change . Blondie and Spectacles gaped at me like the devil himself had poofed into their house . Meanwhile , Jules grinned like she was watching the most entertaining movie of the year . I finished deleting the photos and shoved the camera back into Blondieâ€ ™ s hands . â€œNever ask Ava to do something like this again.â€ I towered over him , relishing the subtle shake of his shoulders as he tried not to cower . â€œIf you do , Iâ€ ™ ll know . And you wonâ€ ™ t like what happens next.â€ â€œOkay , â€ Blondie squeaked . The bathroom door opened . Ava brushed past me and said something to Blondie in a low voice . He nodded . She placed a hand on his arm , and my jaw ticked . â€œLetâ€ ™ s go.â€ The words came out sharper than Iâ€ ™ d intended . Ava finally looked at me , her eyes flashing . â€œWeâ€ ™ ll go when Iâ€ ™ m ready.â€ I didnâ€ ™ t know how Josh dealt with her all these years . Two weeks in , and I already wanted to strangle her . She murmured something else to Blondie before she stalked past me without another word . Jules followed , still grinning . I cast one last glare in Blondieâ€ ™ s direction before I left . Silence permeated the car as we drove back to Thayer . Jules sat in the backseat , tapping away on her phone , while a stone - faced Ava stared out the window from the passenger seat , her shoulders tight . I didnâ€ ™ t mind silence . I craved it . There were few things I found more irritating than incessant , pointless conversation . The weather , the latest blockbuster , who broke up with whoâ€ ¦ who the fuck cared ? Still , something compelled me to turn on the radio halfway through the drive , though I left the volume so low I almost couldnâ€ ™ t hear the music . â€œIt was for your own good , â€ I said over the teeny - tiny beats of the latest rap hit . Ava turned her body further away and didnâ€ ™ t respond . Fine . She could be mad all she wanted . The only thing I regretted was not smashing Blondieâ€ ™ s camera altogether . It wasnâ€ ™ t like I cared about her silent treatment . Not one bit .
16875	16881	16863	16863	she	142	wordsâ€”at least , not the last partâ€”but
17985	18182	17983	17983	her	124	backgroundâ€”German and Japanese on her motherâ€ ™ s side ; Black and Puerto Rican on her fatherâ€ ™ s side . The result was five foot eleven inches of leggy limbs , deep olive skin , and catlike green eyes . Supermodel material , if she had any interest in being a supermodel , which she didnâ€ ™ t. â€œIt was just an observation , but youâ€ ™ re right . I donâ€ ™ t know him well enough to judge . Statement retracted.â€ â€œIâ€ ™ m not upset . Iâ€ ™ mâ€ ¦ â€ I faltered . What the hell was I doing ? Alex didnâ€ ™ t need me defending him . It wasnâ€ ™ t like he was here , listening to us . Even if he were , he wouldnâ€ ™ t care . If there was one person in the world who didnâ€ ™ t give a shit what others thought of him , it was Alex Volkov . â€œGuys , youâ€ ™ re missing the point.â€ Jules waved a hand in the air . â€œThe point is , Alex did show emotion . Over Ava . We could have fun with this.â€
19103	19109	19082	19082	she	142	girlfriendâ€”who I hadnâ€ ™ t known existedâ€”to

19675	19954	19633	19633	I	0	entangledâ€”of being trapped with no way to free myself . The glowing red letters of my alarm clock told me it was four forty - four a.m. A pinprick of dread blossomed at the base of my neck and slithered down my spine . In Chinese culture , the number four is considered unlucky because the word for it sounds like the word â€œdeath.â€ SÃ¬ , four ; sÇ , death . The only difference between their pronunciation is a tone inflection . Iâ€ ™ ve never been a superstitious person , but chills swamped me every time I awoke from one of my nightmares during the four a.m. hour , which was almost always . I couldnâ€ ™ t remember the last time Iâ€ ™ d awoken during a different hour . Sometimes I woke up not remembering I had a nightmare , but those blessed occasions were far and few in between . I heard the soft patter of footsteps in the hall and schooled my features into something other than stark terror before the door opened and Jules slipped inside . She flicked on the lamp , and guilt swirled through me when I saw her rumpled hair and exhausted face . She worked long hours and needed sleep , but she always checked on me even after I insisted she stay in bed . â€œHow bad was it?â€ she asked softly . My bed sank beneath her weight as she sat next to me and handed me a mug of thyme tea . Sheâ€ ™ d read online that it helped with nightmares and started making it for me a few months ago . It helpedâ€”I
20194	20211	20150	20150	she	142	nightmaresâ€”these awful , vivid nightmares that I feared werenâ€ ™ t nightmares at all , but actual memoriesâ€”for
20524	20547	20555	20555	I	0	remainedâ€”a ghostly specter warning me that the past is never past , and the future never unfolds the way we want it to .
20907	20969	20887	20889	Only the strongest	776	â€œAlexâ€”â€ I tired of hearing my name . It was always Alex this , Alex that . People begging for time , money , attention or , worst of all , affection . It was a fucking chore . It really was . â€œGood night.â€ I hung up before he could make another plea for mercy . There was nothing sadder than seeingâ€”or
20975	21174	21337	21337	I	0	hearingâ€”a CEO reduced to a beggar . The hostile takeover of Gruppmann Enterprises would go ahead as planned . I wouldnâ€ ™ t have cared about the company , except it was a useful pawn in the grand scheme of things . Archer Group was a real estate development company , but in five , ten , twenty years , itâ€ ™ d be so much more . Telecommunications , e - commerce , finance , energyâ€ ¦ the world was ripe for my taking . Gruppmann was a small fish in the finance industry , but it was a stepping stone toward my bigger ambitions . I wanted to iron out all the kinks before I took on the sharks . Besides , Andrew was an asshole . I knew for a fact that heâ€ ™ d quietly settled with several of his past secretaries out of court over sexual harassment charges . I blocked Andrewâ€ ™ s number for good measure and made a mental note to fire my assistant for allowing my personal cell information to slip into the hands of someone outside my tightly controlled contacts list . Sheâ€ ™ d already fucked up several timesâ€”paperwork
21188	21302	21337	21337	I	0	VIPsâ€”and this was the last straw . Iâ€ ™ d only kept her on so long as a favor to her father , a congressman who wanted his daughter to get â€œreal work experience , â€ but her experience was over as of eight a.m. tomorrow morning . Iâ€ ™ d deal with her father later . Silence hummed in the air as I placed my coffee cup in the sink and walked toward the living room . I sank onto the couch and closed my eyes , letting my chosen images play through my mind . I didnâ€ ™ t meditate , but this was my own fucked - up form of therapy .
21493	21588	21478	21479	my parents	780	breakfastâ€”blueberry pancakes drenched in syrup with hash browns and crispy bacon on the side . My dad would hold my breakfast while my mom tackled me and yelled , â€œHappy birthday!â€ and Iâ€ ™ d laugh and scream while she tickled me fully awake . It was the one day of the year they let me eat breakfast in bed . After my sister was old enough to walk , sheâ€ ™ d join them , climbing over me and messing up my hair while I complained about girl cooties getting all over my room .
22024	22052	22021	22021	they	456	awayâ€”not because they pitied me , but because they feared me , some base survival instinct deep inside them screaming at them to run and never look back .
22060	22061	22021	22021	they	456	elevenâ€”now twelveâ€”year
22232	22330	22226	22226	they	816	thingâ€”that my obsessive focus on the past would impede my healing process and that I needed to focus my energy on other , more constructive pursuits . A few suggested art while others suggested sports . I suggested they shove their suggestions up their ass . Those therapists didnâ€ ™ t get it . I didnâ€ ™ t want to heal . I wanted to burn . I wanted to bleed . I wanted to feel every scorching lick of pain . And soon , the person responsible for that pain would feel it too . One thousandfold .
22676	22865	22651	22651	I	0	Iâ€”â€ I stopped . Stared . Iâ€ ™ d expected to see Alex in a suit from the office or casual loungewear , though nothing he owned was really casual . Even his T - shirts cost hundreds of dollars . Instead , he wore a deep gray shirt tucked into dark denim jeans and a tailored black Hugo Boss blazer . Awfully dressy for a Thursday night . â€œDid I catch you on your way out?â€ I tried to peer behind him and see if he had company , but Alexâ€ ™ s frame blocked most of the doorway . â€œShould I move so you have a clearer view of my living room?â€ he asked sardonically . Heat scorched my cheeks . Busted . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what youâ€ ™ re talking about . Your living room isnâ€ ™ t that interesting , â€ I fibbed . â€œLack of color . No personal effects.â€ What am I saying ? Someone stop me . â€œThe paintingâ€ ™ s ugly too.â€ Stop me now . â€œ Could use a womanâ€ ™ s touch.â€ Fuck . Me . Sideways .
23044	23340	23341	23341	His	833	homeâ€”though admittedly , I wasnâ€ ™ t watching his house twenty - four - seven like a total creep . The thought of Alex dating wasâ€ ¦ strange . That was the only word I could use to describe the niggling feeling in my stomach , the one that made my skin itch and my pulse beat double time . â€œAh , donâ€ ™ t want to hold you up then.â€ I stepped back and tripped over nothing , because of course I did . He reached out to steady me , and my heart jumped . It wasnâ€ ™ t a big , cheerleading competition worthy jump . It was just a tiny skip , really . But it was enough to fluster me further . â€œIâ€ ™ ll see you later.â€ â€œSince youâ€ ™ re already here , might as well tell me why.â€ Alex was still holding my arm , and the heat from his touch seared me to the bone . â€œI assume this means the cold shoulder treatment is over.â€ Iâ€ ™ d been ignoring him for days since he stormed into Owenâ€ ™ s house like an overbearing , green - eyed tornado . It was the longest Iâ€ ™ d ever held onto my anger . Being upset was exhausting , and I had better things to do with my time , but Iâ€ ™ d wanted to make a point , which was that he couldnâ€ ™ t barge in and try to take over my life without consequences . â€œFor the most part.â€ I narrowed my eyes . â€œDonâ€ ™ t do that again.â€ â€œDonâ€ ™ t parade in front of other men half - naked , and I wonâ€ ™ t have to.â€ â€œI was not paradingâ€”â€
24215	24273	24211	24211	I	0	resistâ€”I scooted closer to him on the couch and pushed his shoulders forward so I could run my palm down his back . His muscles bunched beneath my touch . â€œWhat , â€ he said in a tight , controlled voice . â€œAre you doing?â€ â€œIâ€ ™ m searching for your control panel.â€ I patted his back , tryingâ€”and
24274	24338	24342	24342	he	852	failingâ€”not to notice the sculpted contours of his muscles . Iâ€ ™ d never seen Alex shirtless , but I imagined it was glorious . â€œYou must be a robot.â€ I received a stony glare in response . See ? Robot . â€œDo you have to swap out your batteries , or are you rechargeable?â€ I teased . â€œShould I call you R2 - Dâ€”â€
24371	24530	24365	24365	he	852	wristâ€”not enough to hurt , but enough to warn me he could easily break me if he wanted . Our eyes locked , and the roaring intensified . Beneath those jade pools of ice , I glimpsed a spark of something that sent heat curling through my stomach . â€œIâ€ ™ m not a toy , Ava , â€ Alex said , his voice lethally soft . â€œDonâ€ ™ t play with me unless you want to get hurt.â€ I swallowed my fear . â€œYou wouldnâ€ ™ t hurt me.â€ That mysterious spark crystallized into anger . â€œThis is why Josh was so worried about you . You are trusting to a fault.â€ He leaned forward a fraction of an inch , and it was all I could do not to lean back . Alexâ€ ™ s presence crackled with coiled energy , and I had the unnerving sense that beneath all that ice lay a volcano waiting to eruptâ€”and
24613	24940	24946	24946	he	856	furyâ€”fear of that hard , unyielding look in his eyes ; fury over how he spoke to me like I was a naÃ¯ve child who couldnâ€ ™ t tie her shoelaces without hurting herself . â€œThis seems like an overreaction to a simple joke , â€ I said , my jaw tight . â€œIâ€ ™ m sorry I touched you without permission , but you couldâ€ ™ ve told me to stop instead of giving me an entire speech about how you think Iâ€ ™ m a helpless idiot.â€ His nostrils flared . â€œI donâ€ ™ t think youâ€ ™ re a helpless idiot.â€ My anger edged out my fear . â€œYes , you do . You and Josh both . You always say you want to â€˜protectâ€ ™ me like Iâ€ ™ m not a grown woman whoâ€ ™ s perfectly capable of handling herself . Just because I see the good in people doesnâ€ ™ t mean Iâ€ ™ m an idiot . I think optimism is a good trait , and I feel sorry for people who go through life believing the worst of others.â€ â€œThatâ€ ™ s because theyâ€ ™ ve seen the worst.â€ â€œPeople see what they want to see , â€ I countered . â€œAre there awful people in the world ? Yes . Do awful things happen ? Yes . But wonderful people exist and wonderful things happen too , and if you focus too much on the negative , you miss all the positive.â€ Utter silence , made all the more awkward by the fact that I was still straddling Alexâ€ ™ s leg . I was sure he would yell at me , but to my shock , Alexâ€ ™ s face relaxed into a hint of a smile . His fingers grazed the small of my back , and I almost jumped out of my skin . â€œThose rose - tinted glasses look good on you , Sunshine.â€
25054	25064	25052	25052	He	856	notâ€”what ? An inferno consumed my body . â€œYouâ€ ™ reâ€”youâ€”no
25261	25358	25255	25255	you	0	â€œIâ€”youâ€”â€ Forget Antarctica . I had to move to Mars . Alexâ€ ™ s laughter subsided , but the twinkle in his eyes remained . â€œWhatâ€ ™ s the next movie?â€ â€œExcuse me?â€ He angled his chin toward the DVD on the table . â€œYou brought two movies . Whatâ€ ™ s the second one?â€ The sudden subject change gave me whiplash , but I wasnâ€ ™ t complaining . I didnâ€ ™ t want to speak about my dripping anything with Alex . Ever . My thighs clenched , and I gritted out , â€œMarley & Me.â€

25751	26024	25740	25740	Iâ€	106	eyesâ€”sheâ€ ™ d been turned on . And if she hadnâ€ ™ t moved away when she didâ€ ¦ I tore my gaze away , my jaw clenching at the unwelcome thoughts crowding my brain . I shouldnâ€ ™ t have been thinking about my best friendâ€ ™ s sister this way , but something had shifted . I wasnâ€ ™ t sure when or how , but Iâ€ ™ d started seeing Ava less as Joshâ€ ™ s baby sister and more as a woman . A beautiful , pure - hearted but feisty woman who might be the death of me one of these days . I never shouldâ€ ™ ve invited her in earlier . I shouldâ€ ™ ve gone on my date with Madeline like Iâ€ ™ d planned , but truth be told , I couldnâ€ ™ t stand Madelineâ€ ™ s company outside the bedroom . She was gorgeous , rich , sophisticated , and understood sheâ€ ™ d get nothing more than a physical relationship out of me , but she insisted on being wined and dined before each of our sex sessions . I only obliged because the woman fucked like a porn star . A night in with Ava , as bad of an idea as it had turned out to be , had sounded far more appealing than another tiresome meal at a generic fancy restaurant where Madeline preened and pretended we were a couple in front of D.C.â€ ™ s movers and shakers . She didnâ€ ™ t expect any strings from our arrangement , but she liked status symbols , and Iâ€”as
26048	26310	26333	26333	Josh	106	Issueâ€”was a status symbol . I didnâ€ ™ t care . I used her ; she used me . We got orgasms out of it . It was a mutually beneficial relationship , but my arrangement with Madeline had run its course . Her less - than - pleased reaction when I called to tell her I couldnâ€ ™ t make it tonight had cemented my decision . Madeline had no claim over me , and if she thought a few dinners and blowjobs would change my mind , she was sorely mistaken . I lifted Ava so I could tuck her beneath the covers . Iâ€ ™ d expected her to sleep with a dreamy smile like the one she always wore when she was awake . Instead , her brows were drawn , her mouth tight , her breathing shallow . I almost smoothed a hand over her brow before I caught myself . Instead , I changed into a pair of black sweats , flicked off the light , and climbed into the other side of bed . A gentleman would sleep on the couch or the floor , but of all the insults people had thrown my way over the years , â€œgentlemanâ€ wasnâ€ ™ t one of them . I laced my hands behind my head , trying to ignore the soft female presence beside me . Sleep wasnâ€ ™ t forthcoming , per usual , but instead of flipping to a specific day in my mental scrapbook , I let my mind wander as it pleased .
26737	26744	26745	26745	I	0	youâ€”oh.â€ The female voice behind me halted .
26766	26797	26760	26760	She	900	shortâ€”probably five foot five , but compared to my six - three , she was miniature - sized . With her rosebud lips and delicate face , she resembled a doll .
27107	27121	27099	27099	Her	167	â€œHeâ€”â€ She choked like she couldnâ€ ™ t get enough air in her lungs .

27748	27898	27744	27744	I	0	upâ€”straight into a pair of familiar green eyes . Eyes that stared back at me with no hint of the humor from last night . He flicked his gaze down . I followed itâ€ ¦ and realized , to my abject horror , that I was touching Alex Volkovâ€ ™ s dick . Unintentionally , and he had on sweats , but still . I. Was . Touching . Alex . Volkovâ€ ™ s. Dick . And it was hard . Mortification washed over me in a tidal wave . Move your hand . Move it now ! My brain screamed , and I wanted to . I really did . But I stayed frozen , paralyzed by shock and humiliation and something else I would rather not name . A brief image flashed through my mind of what Alex must be packing beneath his pants . I had a feelingâ€”pun

I finally yanked my hand away and scrambled back , my heart beating a wild rhythm in my chest as I tried to get my bearings . â€œWhat happened ? Why am I here ? Did weâ€”did
27969	28008	27744	27744	I	0	Iâ€”â€ I gestured between us , sick with anticipation . Oh , God , Josh would kill me , and I couldnâ€ ™ t even blame him . Iâ€ ™ d slept with my brotherâ€ ™ s best friend .
28761	28807	28813	28813	Alexâ€	113	Iâ€”I have to go . Volunteer . Pets , â€ I stammered , barely making sense to myself . â€œThanksforlettingmestayoverseeyoulaterbye ! â€ I beat a hasty retreat down the stairs and ran home . I needed a cold shower , ASAP . PHASE SADNESS STATUS : FAILED

Bridget and I were cleaning and sanitizing the cages at Wags and Whiskers , a pet rescue shelter located near campus . She was a huge animal person and had been volunteering here since sophomore year . I accompanied her when I had time , as did Stella . Jules was allergic to cats , so she stayed away . But this shelter was Bridgetâ€ ™ s baby . She came twice a week without fail , much to Boothâ€ ™ s consternation . I stifled a smile at the sight of the burly , redheaded bodyguard eyeing a parrot with suspicion . Despite its name , Wags and Whiskers took in all sorts of animals , not just cats and dogs , and it had a small but robust bird section . Booth wasnâ€ ™ t scared of birds per se , but he disliked them ; he said they reminded him of giant flying rats . â€œHmm.â€ Bridget seemed disappointed by my uninteresting response . â€œAnd the movies really didnâ€ ™ t make him sad ? At all?â€ â€œNope.â€ I rolled up the newspaper from my cage and dumped it in the garbage can . â€œWell , I fell asleep before the end of Marley & Me , but I doubt he cried or anything like that . He looked bored the entire time.â€ â€œYet he continued watching both movies.â€ Bridget raised a perfect blonde brow . â€œInteresting.â€ â€œHe didnâ€ ™ t have a choice . I was already at his house.â€ â€œPlease . This is Alex Volkov weâ€ ™ re talking about . Heâ€ ™ d throw someone out in a heartbeat if he wanted.â€ True . I frowned and considered her words . â€œHeâ€ ™ s nicer to me because Iâ€ ™ m Joshâ€ ™ s sister.â€ â€œRight.â€ Bridget let out a soft laugh . â€œWhich phase is up next again?â€ Ugh , the stupid Operation Emotion , or OE as Iâ€ ™ d started calling it . It was the bane of my existence . â€œDisgust.â€ I had no clue what Iâ€ ™ d do , but that phase seemed easier . I had a feeling lots of things disgusted Alex . â€œIâ€ ™ d pay good money to see that.â€ Bridget tossed a laughing glance in Boothâ€ ™ s direction . â€œAre you all right , Booth?â€ â€œYes , Your Highness.â€ He grimaced when the parrot squawked , â€œOoh , yes ! Spank me , master!â€ â€œI am not your master , â€ he told the bird . â€œGo away.â€ The parrot drew itself up and ruffled its feathers in indignation . Bridget and I burst into laughter . Apparently , the parrotâ€ ™ s old owner had been quite active sexuallyâ€ ¦ and kinky . Its outburst today was tame compared to its previous tirades . â€œIâ€ ™ ll miss you.â€ Bridget sighed . â€œI hope my next bodyguard has a sense of humor.â€ I stopped scrubbing the cage . â€œWait , what ? Booth , youâ€ ™ re leaving us?â€ Booth scratched the back of his neck , looking sheepish . â€œMy wife is giving birth soon , so Iâ€ ™ ll be on paternity leave.â€ â€œCongrats.â€ I smiled , even though I was pretty sad . He was Bridgetâ€ ™ s employee , but weâ€ ™ d accepted him as an honorary member of our group . Heâ€ ™ d bailed us out of many dodgy situations in the past , and he gave pretty good boy advice , too . â€œWeâ€ ™ ll miss you , but that is so exciting!â€ His face flushed with pleasure . â€œThank you , Miss Ava.â€ He was unfailingly polite and insisted on calling me â€œMissâ€ no matter how many times I told him he could use just my first name . â€œWeâ€ ™ re throwing you a going away party when the time comes , â€ Bridget said . â€œYou deserve it for putting up with me all these years.â€ Boothâ€ ™ s blush deepened . â€œThatâ€ ™ s not necessary , Your Highness .

31026	31061	31066	31066	she	974	Alexâ€”at least , none that werenâ€ ™ t illegal or fucked up . Jules , who was more comfortable with â€œfucked upâ€ than the rest of us , joked about pretending to rob him at knifepointâ€”at
31068	31582	31066	31066	she	974	jokingâ€”until Stella pointed out Alex would likely turn the situation around and kill me before he figured out it was a prank . I agreed . I was too young to die , so we scrapped any ideas that would involve a physical confrontation . In the absence of any lightbulb moments , I turned to my last resort , Josh . We video - chatted every week , catching each other up on our lives , and right now , he was telling me about his new â€œfriend with benefits.â€ Seriously . Trust Josh to find women even in the middle of a tiny Central American village doing medical volunteer work . â€œHow is that possible?â€ I demanded . â€œThereâ€ ™ s less than a hundred people in that village!â€ I knew because Iâ€ ™ d Googled it after Josh announced his placement . â€œWhat can I say ? Iâ€ ™ m charmed , â€ he drawled . â€œWherever I go , women follow.â€ â€œI think she was there before you , dickhead , and I hope youâ€ ™ re not neglecting your work to make out with your new â€˜friendâ€ ™ .â€ â€œDa fuck ? Tell me youâ€ ™ re kidding.â€ I waved my hand in the air . â€œI am , I am . Donâ€ ™ t get your knickers in a twist.â€ As much of a horndog as my brother was , he took his work seriously . Whereas I had to bust my ass for my Aâ€ ™ s , he was one of those annoying people who didnâ€ ™ t have to study much to excel in school . But he loved medical work and helping people . Even when we were young , he was the one whoâ€ ™ d bandaged me up after I scraped my knee and looked up ways to help me with my nightmares while our father threw himself into work . It was why I let Josh get away with his overprotectiveness . He could be annoying as hell , but he was still the best brother . Iâ€ ™ d never tell him that though . If his head inflated any more , heâ€ ™ d have trouble walking . â€œBy the way.â€ I tried to sound casual as I fiddled with the sleeve of my shirt . â€œHalloween is coming up , and I was thinking of pulling some pranks . Is there anything Alex is scared of ? Clowns , spiders , heightsâ€ ¦ â€ Suspicion crawled into Joshâ€ ™ s face . â€œHalloween is more than two months away.â€ â€œYeah , but it sneaks up on you , and I want to prepare.â€ â€œHmm.â€ Josh tapped his fingers on his thigh . â€œHmmâ€ ¦ â€ â€œAny time before Iâ€ ™ m eighty would be great.â€ â€œShut up . You know how hard it is to think of something Alex is scared of ? Iâ€ ™ ve known him for eight years , and Iâ€ ™ ve never once seen him afraid.â€ My face fell . Well , shit .
31643	31741	31750	31750	he	978	meâ€”Iâ€ ™ ve tried many times to prank him in the past and failed every time.â€ â€œGood to know.â€ Perhaps this phase was a lost cause . If Josh , who knew Alex better than anyone , couldnâ€ ™ t scare him , none of us could . The suspicion returned to Joshâ€ ™ s eyes . â€œIs this your idea , or a certain redheadâ€ ™ s?â€ â€œUmmmâ€ ¦ mine?â€ â€œBullshit.â€ Josh scowled . â€œDonâ€ ™ t tell me sheâ€ ™ s still infatuated with Alex . Heâ€ ™ s a lost cause when it comes to relationshipsâ€”wonâ€

32610	32613	32614	32615	My friends	394	â€œAvaâ€”â€ â€œAre you sureâ€”â€
32640	32726	32730	32730	his	998	notâ€”â€ I glared at Liam . â€œYou can come looking for me with torches and pitchforks.â€ Heâ€ ™ d hover all night unless I spoke with him , and Iâ€ ™ d rather get it over with . â€œI have more than torches and pitchforks , â€ Booth growled . Liam flinched . I followed him outside the bar and crossed my arms over my chest . â€œMake it quick.â€ â€œI want you to give me another chance.â€ â€œIâ€ ™ ve already told you a thousand timesâ€”no.â€
33069	33098	33066	33066	he	131	â€œYouâ€”â€ I didnâ€ ™ t wait to hear what he said next . I fled back to the safety of the bar , my pulse roaring in my ears .
33382	33796	33797	33797	Colton	205	gameâ€”measured not in weeks or months , but in years . Decades . Even the tiniest of seeds can sprout into the mightiest of oaks . It was a simple concept most people didnâ€ ™ t understand because they were too busy chasing short - term gratification , and it was the reason most people fail . They spent their lives sitting on their asses and telling themselves â€œsomedayâ€ when preparation shouldâ€ ™ ve started yesterday . By the time â€œsomedayâ€ came , it was too late . â€œâ€ ¦ this IP issue with Chinaâ€ ¦ â€ Colton stopped abruptly . Thank God . If I had to listen to his nasal voice one more second , I wouldâ€ ™ ve walked over to the bar and stabbed myself in the eye with a fork . â€œWho is that ? â€ he asked , a hungry look overtaking his face as he stared over my shoulder . â€œSheâ€ ™ s hot . â€ His voice was as hungry as his expression . â€œIâ€ ™ ve never seen her before . Have you?â€ I turned out of mild curiosity . It took me a second to latch onto whatever unsuspecting girl had captured his attention . Colton was almost as big a womanizer as Josh . When I finally located the source of Coltonâ€ ™ s ravenous gaze , my muscles snapped into a rigid line and my fist closed around the stem of my champagne glass , tight enough the delicate glass could shatter at any moment . She glided into the ballroom , her lithe body poured into a sleek gown that flowed over her curves like liquid , shimmering gold . Sheâ€ ™ d gathered her hair up in a fancy hairdo , exposing her swanlike neck and smooth shoulders . Dark eyes . Bronze skin . Red lips . All smiles and sunshine , unaware sheâ€ ™ d walked into a pit of vipers . A goddess entering the gates of hell , and she didnâ€ ™ t even know it . A pulse ticked in my jaw . What the hell was Ava doing here , wearing that dress ? She wasnâ€ ™ t an alumna yet . She shouldnâ€ ™ t be here . Not around these people . I wanted to gouge out the eyes of every man staring at her like they were starved and she was a juicy steak , which was pretty much every man hereâ€”including
35073	35079	35069	35069	Josh	106	meâ€”if he tells you anything at allâ€”but
35321	35323	35317	35317	I	0	desireâ€”a tiny oneâ€”and
35591	36294	35577	35577	They	648	somethingâ€”to allow it to consume you and turn you into a version of yourself you didnâ€ ™ t recognize . Death was oblivion ; life was reality , the harshest truth that had ever existed . â€œYou want it so much youâ€ ™ d say yes to anything . Believe in anyone . One more favor , one more kind gestureâ€ ¦ and maybe , just maybe , theyâ€ ™ ll give you the love you want so desperately youâ€ ™ d whore yourself out for it.â€ My tone turned biting ; the conversation made a U - turn and headed straight for harsh and brutal . Because what I admired most about Ava was also what I hated about her . Darkness craves light as much as it wants to destroy it , and here , in this ballroom , with her in my arms and my cock straining against my zipper , that had never been more clear . I hated how much I wanted her , and I hated that she wasnâ€ ™ t smart enough to run away from me while she still had a chance . Though letâ€ ™ s be honest , it was already too late . She was mine . She just didnâ€ ™ t know it yet . I hadnâ€ ™ t known it myself until I saw her in Coltonâ€ ™ s arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away . To claim what belonged to me . Iâ€ ™ d expected her to grow angry at my words , to cry or run away . Instead , she stared at me , unflinching , and said the most unbelievable thing Iâ€ ™ d heard in a long , long time . â€œAre you talking about me , or are you talking about yourself?â€ I almost laughed at the sheer ludicrousness of the statement . â€œYou must have me confused with someone else , Sunshine.â€ â€œI donâ€ ™ t think I do.â€ Ava stood on tiptoes so she could whisper in my ear . â€œYou donâ€ ™ t fool me anymore , Alex Volkov . Iâ€ ™ ve been thinking about it , the way you noticed all those things about me . How you agreed to look after me , even though you couldâ€ ™ ve said no . How you stayed in to watch those movies with me when you thought I was upset and let me stay the night in your bed after I fell asleep . And Iâ€ ™ ve come to a conclusion . You want the world to think you have no heart when in reality , you have a multilayered one : a heart of gold encased in a heart of ice . And the one thing all hearts of gold have in common ? They crave love.â€ I tightened my grip on her , equal parts furious and turned on by her foolish , stubborn goodness . â€œWhat did I tell you about romanticizing me?â€ I wanted her , but it wasnâ€ ™ t a sweet , tender kind of want . It was a dirty , ugly want , tainted by the blood on my hands and a desire to drag her out of the sunshine and into my night . â€œItâ€ ™ s not romanticizing if itâ€ ™ s true.â€ A growl slipped out of my throat . I allowed myself to hold onto her for one more moment before I pushed her away . â€œGo home , Ava . This isnâ€ ™ t the place for you.â€ â€œIâ€ ™ ll go home when I want to go home.â€ â€œStop being difficult.â€ â€œStop being a jerk.â€ â€œI thought I had a heart of gold , â€ I mocked . â€œChoose a side and stick to it , Sunshine.â€ â€œEven gold can tarnish if you donâ€ ™ t take care of it.â€ Ava stepped back , and I tamped down the ridiculous urge to follow her . â€œI paid for my ticket , and Iâ€ ™ m staying here until I decide I want to leave . Thank you for the dance.â€ She walked away , leaving me in fuming silence .

Iâ€ ™ d just wrapped up anâ€ ¦ enlightening conversation with the head of a major consulting company when I lost sight of Ava . One minute she was there ; the next , she was gone . She was still gone twenty minutes laterâ€”far
36853	37246	36847	36847	Ava	99	Whatâ€”â€ â€œMind if I join the fun?â€ I hauled Liam up by his collar , my lip curling at the sight of his watering eyes and bleeding nose , and socked him in the gut . â€œThatâ€ ™ s for calling her a slut.â€ Another blow to the jaw . â€œThatâ€ ™ s for holding her against her will.â€ A third hit to his already - suffering nose . â€œThatâ€ ™ s for cheating on her.â€ I continued my blows , letting the fire wash over me until Liam was unconscious and Ava had to drag me off him . â€œAlex , stop . Youâ€ ™ ll kill him!â€ I adjusted my shirtsleeves , breathing hard . â€œIs that supposed to deter me?â€ I could go all night and not stop until the bastard was nothing more than a pile of bloodied flesh and broken bones . A film of red tinted my vision , and my knuckles were bruised from the force of my blows . The image of him pinning Ava against the wall flashed through my mind , and my anger erupted anew . â€œLetâ€ ™ s just go . He learned his lesson , and if someone sees you , youâ€ ™ ll get in trouble.â€ Avaâ€ ™ s face was the color of porcelain . â€œPlease.â€ â€œHe wouldnâ€ ™ t dare say anything.â€ Nevertheless , I relented because of how bad she was trembling . Despite her toughness earlier , Ava was shaken up over the incident . Plus , she was right ; we were lucky no one had stumbled in on us yet . I didnâ€ ™ t give a shit if they did , but there was no need to drag out an already unpleasant evening . â€œWe should call an ambulance.â€ She eyed Liamâ€ ™ s prone form with unease . â€œWhat if heâ€ ™ s seriously hurt?â€ Of course she still cared about his well - being after he tried to fucking assault her . I didnâ€ ™ t know whether to laugh in disbelief or shake her . â€œHe wonâ€ ™ t die.â€ Iâ€ ™ d controlled my hits so they were punishing but not fatal . â€œHeâ€ ™ ll wake up with a helluva banged - up face and a couple of broken ribs , but heâ€ ™ ll survive.â€ Unfortunately .

It wasnâ€ ™ t the lighthearted conversation Iâ€ ™ d envisioned when Iâ€ ™ d suggested we â€œsalvage the rest of the night , â€ but I felt ten times lighter by the time I finished . â€œThey told me it was my mom , â€ I said . â€œMy parents were going through a nasty divorce , and apparently , my mom had some sort of breakdown and pushed me into the lake , knowing I couldnâ€ ™ t swim . I wouldâ€ ™ ve drowned had my dad not come by to drop off some papers and seen what happened . He saved me , and my momâ€ ™ s condition deteriorated further until she killed herself . They told me I was lucky to be alive butâ€ ¦ â€ I drew in a shuddering breath . â€œSometimes , I donâ€ ™ t feel lucky.â€ Alex had listened patiently the entire time , but his eyes flickered dangerously at my last statement . â€œDonâ€ ™ t say that.â€ â€œI know . Itâ€ ™ s super self - pitying , which is not what I want . But what you said at the gala earlier ? About me craving love ? Youâ€ ™ re right.â€ My chin wobbled . Call me crazy , but something about being tucked away this corner of a random diner , sitting across from a man who I thought didnâ€ ™ t even like me until a few hours ago , made me voice my most insidious thoughts . â€œMy mom tried to kill me . My dad barely pays attention to me . Parents are supposed to be the most loving forces in their childrenâ€ ™ s lives , butâ€ ¦ â€ A tear slipped down my cheek , and my voice broke . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what I did wrong . Maybe if I tried harder to be a good daughterâ€”â€

It was September , but a different kind of winter whooshed in on a cloud of delicious spice and cool reserve . Alex entered the room , cutting a sleek , powerful figure in his all - black outfitâ€”black
41583	41590	41582	41582	Alex	98	Volkovâ€”for all his control , all his powerâ€”was
41674	42056	41648	41648	I	0	outâ€”partly out of fear of rejection , partly because I was too shy to make the first move . But I had a feeling if I waited for Alex , I might have to wait forever . It was time to take matters into my own hands â€œIf I wanted you , I wouldâ€ ™ ve taken you already , â€ Alex said with lethal softness . â€œUnless youâ€ ™ re too scared.â€ I was playing with fire , but that was better than standing out in the cold alone . I stiffened when Alex trailed his fingers down my neck and over my shoulder . His lips curved into a smirk . â€œNervous ? I thought this was what you wanted , â€ he taunted . His hand dipped lower , closer to the curve of my breast . The ice pools in his eyes melted , revealing a blazing inferno that heated me from head to toe . My head spun . My nipples tightened into firm beads , and my pulse throbbed through every inch of my body . Somehow , it was worse that he wasnâ€ ™ t touching me where I ached most ; the anticipation heightened my senses , and my skin tingled with phantom caresses . â€œThatâ€ ™ s not what I said , â€ I wheezed . Oh God , this was embarrassing . What had I been thinking ? I wasnâ€ ™ t a femme fatale or aâ€ ¦ aâ€ ¦ whatever else was like a femme fatale . I couldnâ€ ™ t think straight . Alex grazed his thumb over my breast , and I moaned . Moaned . From a touch that lasted less than two seconds . I wanted to die . His pupils dilated until the green irises were eclipses ringed with jade fire . He dropped his hand , and cool air rushed in to replace the warmth of his touch . â€œFinish the photoshoot , Ava.â€ The roughness of his voice scraped against my skin . â€œWhat?â€ I was too shocked by the sudden change in the atmosphere to process his words . â€œThe photoshoot . Finish it , â€ he gritted out . â€œUnless you want to start something youâ€ ™ re not ready to finish.â€ â€œIâ€”â€
42132	42215	42123	42123	I	0	â€œThanksâ€”â€ Alex stood , grabbed his coat , and walked out without another word . â€œFor doing this , â€ I finished , my words echoing in the empty room . I exhaled a long - held breath . Alex was the most mercurial person I knew . One minute , he was gentle and protective ; the next , he was closed - off and distant . I scrolled through the photos , curious as to how theyâ€ ™ d turned out .

43092	43174	43082	43082	Iâ€	106	graceâ€”according to the information my people dug up , Liam had picked up a nasty drug habit and several DUIs since graduating . It was only a matter of time before he fucked up at his job or pissed off the wrong people on his own . He was a man whoâ€ ™ d had everything handed to him on a silver platter , and he threw it away for a temporary high . Excuse me while I cry a nonexistent river .
43746	44126	44127	44127	Her	1195	workedâ€”a little too well , judging by Madelineâ€ ™ s glare . â€œI didnâ€ ™ t realize you knew Alex , â€ I fibbed . My stomach churned , and not because of Madelineâ€ ™ s poisonous tone . The Haussesâ€ ™ pool room looked like a luxurious , modern Roman bath , all white marble and gilded columns . The pool itself gleamed turquoise beneath a glass dome that revealed the night sky in all its glory , and I spotted the colorful swirl of mosaics beneath the water forming the shape of a mermaid . But the smell of chlorine and sight of all that waterâ€ ¦ My dinner rose in my throat . The Hausses lived in a giant house in Bethesda , and Stella and I had spent the night room hopping , enjoying the different music and entertainment options in each space . While Stella left to find us fresh drinks , Iâ€ ™ d wandered into the room next to the one weâ€ ™ d been in and found myself facing my worst , watery nightmare . Madeline had cornered me before I could leave , and here we were . â€œOh , I know Alex very well , â€ Madeline said , and I knew , with a sickening drop in my stomach , that she was one of the â€œcertain womenâ€ heâ€ ™ d been involved with . Were they still involved ? Was she the one heâ€ ™ d almost gone on a date with before I ambushed him for movie night ? Jealousy gnawed at me , almost overpowering my nausea from the chlorine . â€œWhat I donâ€ ™ t get is why he would be interested in you . â€ She flicked her gaze over me . â€œI doubt you can keep up with his tastes in the bedroom.â€ Despite myself , curiosity reared its ugly head . What tastes ? â€œYouâ€ ™ d be surprised , â€ I bluffed , hoping sheâ€ ™ d reveal more information . My mind flashed back to my sex dream starring Alex , and my heart raced . Madeline smirked . â€œPlease . You look like the type who expects tender kisses and sweet nothings in bed . But as you probably knowâ€”â€
44610	44636	44606	44606	I	0	” My mind blanked when my body pitched backward and hit the pool with a splash . Sheâ€ ™ d pushed me . Into the pool .

44919	44920	44952	44952	I	0	whatâ€”or whoâ€”I
45082	45178	45072	45072	I	0	neckâ€”not enough to injure , but enough to make her flinch . â€œYes , â€ she choked out , resentment coating her voice . â€œGood.â€ I released her and walked away , keeping my steps calm when all I wanted was to race to Avaâ€ ™ s house and check if she was okay . She hadnâ€ ™ t answered any of my calls and texts , and while I understood why , it still made me nervous . â€œIs she really worth it?â€ Madeline called after me . I didnâ€ ™ t bother answering her .
45221	45952	45960	45960	I	0	poolâ€”or how she must feel right now . A mixture of worry and anger coiled in my stomach . Fuck what I told Madeline earlier . Sheâ€ ™ d put a huge target on her familyâ€ ™ s back , and I wouldnâ€ ™ t rest until Hauss Industries was no more than a footnote in corporate history . I pulled up to Avaâ€ ™ s house in time to see Stella exiting . I cut the engine and made it to the front door in half a dozen long strides . â€œHow is she?â€ I demanded . Worry etched itself on Stellaâ€ ™ s face . â€œShe could be worse , given the circumstances . I was getting us drinks when she went into the pool roomâ€ ¦ â€ She gnawed on her bottom lip . â€œAnyway , I found her when that woman pushed her into the pool . I got her out before she passed out or anything like that , but sheâ€ ™ s pretty shaken . Jules isnâ€ ™ t home yet , and I wanted to stay with her , but she said sheâ€ ™ s going to sleep and insisted I leave.â€ Stellaâ€ ™ s brows knit together . â€œYou should check on her . Just in case.â€ That was a big ask coming from Stella , who liked me the least out of Avaâ€ ™ s friends , and it said a lot about Avaâ€ ™ s current state . â€œIâ€ ™ ll take it from here.â€ I brushed past her into the living room . â€œHow did you find out what happened so fast?â€ Stella called after me . â€œOnline , â€ was all I said . I made a mental note to call my tech guy and have him scrub every trace of the video off the internet . He was the same person I relied on to hack into my competitorsâ€ ™ computers and dig up offshore accounts . Five years of working together , and there hadnâ€ ™ t been a single leak or job he couldnâ€ ™ t complete . In return , Iâ€ ™ d paid him enough money over the years that he could buy a private island off the coast of Fiji if he wanted . I took the stairs two at a time until I reached Avaâ€ ™ s room . The light spilling through the crack in the door told me she was still awake , despite what sheâ€ ™ d told Stella . I rapped my knuckle twice against the wood . â€œItâ€ ™ s Alex.â€ There was a short pause . â€œCome in.â€ Ava sat in bed , her hair damp and her gaze wary as she took me in . Worry edged out my anger when I saw how pale her cheeks were and the way she shivered , even though the heat was on and sheâ€ ™ d tucked herself beneath a thick comforter . â€œI saw what happened . Some fucker filmed it live on social.â€ I sat on the edge of the bed and resisted the insane urge to tuck her into my chest . â€œIâ€ ™ m sorry.â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s not your fault . Donâ€ ™ t blame yourself for fucked - up things other people do.â€ A smile ghosted my mouth as she threw my words back at me . â€œYou have terrible taste in women though.â€ Ava sniffled . â€œDo better.â€ â€œMadeline and I are over . We never even started.â€ â€œThatâ€ ™ s not what she told me.â€ I cocked my head at her stiff tone . â€œAre youâ€ ¦ jealous?â€ The thought pleased me more than it shouldâ€ ™ ve . â€œNo.â€ With her scowl and fluffy gray top , she looked like an angry kitten . â€œAs if . So what if sheâ€ ™ s tall and blonde and looks like a Victoriaâ€ ™ s Secret model ? Sheâ€ ™ s a horrible person . Next time I see her , Iâ€ ™ m going Krav Maga on her ass.â€ I bit back a full smile . Ava had attended all of one lesson . Itâ€ ™ d be a while before she went anything on anyoneâ€ ™ s ass , but her indignation was adorable . â€œShe wonâ€ ™ t be bothering you again.â€ I grew serious . â€œThe poolâ€”â€
46446	46586	46587	46587	He	1237	attackâ€”most of the time . The thought of flying over an ocean still made me sick to my stomach , but weâ€ ™ d get there . The most important thing was , I had hope . If I worked long and hard enough , then maybe one day , I would finally conquer the fear that had haunted me for as long as I could remember . But that wasnâ€ ™ t the only seismic change in my life . Something had shifted in my relationship with Alex . He was no longer just my brotherâ€ ™ s best friend , but my friend too , though some of the thoughts I had toward him were less than platonic . What Iâ€ ™ d felt during our photoshoot was nothing compared to the fantasies running through my mind now .
46690	46830	46838	46838	his	1240	incidentâ€”no heated gazes , no lingering touches , no trace of the desire Iâ€ ™ d seen on his face in that photo from our shoot . I hoped that would change tonight . â€œIâ€ ™ m nervous.â€ Stella crouched behind the couch ; she was so tall she had to bend all the way so her dark curls didnâ€ ™ t peek out from the top . â€œAre you nervous?â€ â€œNo , â€ I lied . I was definitely nervous . It was Alexâ€ ™ s birthday , and I was throwing him a surprise party . There was every chance he hated both surprises and parties , but I felt compelled to do something for him . Besides , no one should be alone on their birthday . Iâ€ ™ d asked Alex what his plans for tonight wereâ€”not
46839	46856	46838	46838	his	1240	birthdayâ€”and he said he had business documents to look over . Business documents . On his birthday .
46956	46967	46968	46968	I	0	ideaâ€”Alex didnâ€ ™ t strike me as a costume sort of guyâ€”but
47659	47954	47955	47955	I	0	groupsâ€”garbage duty , sweeping duty , etcetera . Alex and I somehow ended up on dish duty together . Ralph didnâ€ ™ t have a dishwasher , so I hand - washed while he dried . â€œI hope you had a good time , â€ I said , scrubbing caked - on sugar from a plate . â€œSorry if we gave you a heart attack.â€ His chuckle sent the butterflies in my stomach into a tizzy . â€œIt would take more than a surprise party to give me a heart attack.â€ He took the plate from me and wiped it dry before setting it on the dish rack . Seeing Alex do something as domestic as dishes sent another flutter through my system . I have serious issues . â€œI had a good time though.â€ He cleared his throat , his cheeks coloring . â€œThis was my first birthday party since my parents died.â€ I froze . Alex had never brought up his parents before , but I knew from Josh theyâ€ ™ d died when he was young , which meant he hadnâ€ ™ t had a birthday party in at least a decade . My heart ached for him . Not because of the party , but because he could no longer celebrate with his family . For the first time , I realized how lonely Alex must be with no relatives left in the world except for his uncle . â€œSo what do you usually do on your birthday?â€ I asked in a soft voice . He shrugged . â€œWork . Grab a drink with Josh . Itâ€ ™ s not a big deal . My parents made it a big deal , but after their death , it seemed pointless.â€ â€œHow didâ€”â€
48093	48146	48091	48093	Thatâ€ ™ sâ€”I	108	sâ€”I have no words.â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s all right . At least they caught the bastards who pulled the trigger.â€ â€œAnd the business rival?â€ I asked softly . His eye twitched . â€œKarma will get him.â€ My heart weighed heavy in my chest even before something more horrifying occurred to me . â€œYour HSAMâ€”â€
48602	48943	48952	48952	he	1288	” I gasped when Alex yanked me toward him and deepened the kiss . His hand fisted my hair and tugged , forcing my back to arch while his tongue plundered my mouth . â€œNot the romance you were thinking of , is it?â€ he growled , his grip so tight my eyes watered . Heâ€ ™ d spun me around so the edge of the counter dug into my flesh , and he used his other hand to hitch my leg up around his waist . His thick erection pressed against my core , and I ground against it shamelessly , desperate for the friction . â€œTell me to stop , Sunshine.â€ â€œNo.â€ Tell him to stop ? A herd of wild horses couldnâ€ ™ t drag me away . I inched my hand beneath his shirt , eager to explore the expanse of smooth skin and hard muscles beneath my fingers . My entire body pulsated with need , and the possibility of someone walking in on us any moment further heightened my arousal . It was only a kiss , but it seemed so much more illicit . Dangerous . Alex groaned . His mouth claimed mine again , and the kiss turned fierce . Wanting . Hungry . He was ruthless in his invasion of my senses , his touch so hot and possessive it branded itself into my skin , and I surrendered to him without a shred of resistance . I was on the verge of unbuckling his belt when he pulled away so forcefully I stumbled forward , disoriented by the sudden loss of contact . My core throbbed , my nipples could cut diamonds , and my skin was so sensitive even the brush of air caused me to tremble . But when the fog of sensation dissipated , I realized Alex was glaring at me . â€œFuck.â€ He scrubbed a hand over his face , his scowl fierce enough to make grown men quake . â€œFuck , fuck , fuck . â€ â€œAlexâ€”â€
48982	49151	49160	49160	him	1292	Joshâ€”â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s not about Josh.â€ Alex pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled a slow , controlled breath . â€œNot entirely.â€ â€œThen what is it?â€ He wanted me . I knew he did ; I felt it , and Iâ€ ™ m not just talking about the massive bulge straining his pants . Yes , Josh would attempt to murder us both if he found out what happened , but he couldnâ€ ™ t stay mad at us forever . Besides , he didnâ€ ™ t return to D.C. until Christmas . We had time . â€œItâ€ ™ s me . And you . Together . It wonâ€ ™ t work.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s glare intensified . â€œWhatever fantasies you have of us swirling in that pretty head of yours , kill them . That kiss was a one - time mistake . Itâ€ ™ ll never happen again.â€ I wanted to die of mortification . I wasnâ€ ™ t sure what wouldâ€ ™ ve been worseâ€”Alex

Attending a silent ashram in the middle of the desert?â€ â€œThatâ€ ™ s for me to know and for you never to find out.â€ A vein throbbed at my temple . â€œDammit , Ava , this isnâ€ ™ t funny.â€ â€œI never said it was.â€ She threw her hands in the air . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what you want me to say . I kissed you , you kissed me back , then you said it was a mistake , and we agreed never to do it again . I thought you wanted space , and I gave it to you . Iâ€ ™ m not one of those girls who chases after guys who donâ€ ™ t want them.â€ Ava pressed her lips together . â€œI know everythingâ€ ™ s been messed up between us since Saturday . Maybe we need toâ€ ¦ not spend as much time together . I can do the visualizations on my own , and when the time comes , I can find another swim instructorâ€”â€
50612	50669	50671	50671	My	0	isâ€”â€ â€œPerfect for your needs , Iâ€ ™ m sure , â€ Fred cut in . Heâ€ ™ d lost his scowl and now beamed at me like I was the second coming of Jesus . â€œAva , why donâ€ ™ t you ring this gentleman up for the Richard Argus moonlight piece?â€ She looked uneasy . â€œButâ€”â€
50833	51067	50812	50812	Ava	217	canâ€”â€ â€œI thought it was expensive.â€ I allowed myself a soft laugh at her stunned expression . â€œItâ€ ™ s not a big deal . Iâ€ ™ ll own a new piece of art , youâ€ ™ ll receive a hefty commission , and your manager will kiss your ass until the end of days . Win - win.â€ Fred returned with a large black - and - white print . Fifteen minutes later , the print had been packaged with the same care one would use to handle a newborn baby , and my bank account was forty thousand dollars lighter . â€œThis weekend , our usual time , Z Hotel , â€ I told Ava after dismissing Fred . Her eyebrows shot up . We usually practiced at one of our houses or near a lake or Thayerâ€ ™ s pool so she could get more comfortable near water . â€œIt has the best indoor pool in D.C.,â€ I explained . â€œYouâ€ ™ re ready for actual swimming lessons.â€ Sheâ€ ™ d been ready for a while , but Iâ€ ™ d wanted to make sure before throwing her into the deep end , so to speak . Ava sucked in a breath . â€œReally?â€ â€œYeah.â€ I flashed a crooked smile . â€œSee you Saturday , Sunshine.â€ I left the gallery in a remarkably better mood than when Iâ€ ™ d entered .

52405	52552	52557	52557	His	1357	justâ€”â€ He gestured toward the pool with his free hand . â€œI just what ? Had a panic attack ? I get those all the time when Iâ€ ™ m near water . If that bothers you , weâ€ ™ re in a hotel . We can find a room.â€ It seemed like Iâ€ ™ d recovered all the boldness Iâ€ ™ d lost after kissing Alex on his birthday . His mouth tilted up . â€œWhen did you get so feisty?â€ â€œWhen I got sick of everyone treating me like Iâ€ ™ m a fragile flower whoâ€ ™ ll break if someone breathes on me the wrong way . Just because I have a phobia over one specific thing doesnâ€ ™ t mean Iâ€ ™ ll freak out in other areas of my life.â€ I paused , then added , â€œMadeline told me . About what youâ€”what
52592	52673	52582	52582	His	1357	meâ€”â€ I gulped . â€œShe told me you only do it from behind . That you donâ€ ™ t like kissing or face - to - face contact during sex . That youâ€ ¦ â€ â€œThat I what?â€ Alex asked silkily . â€œThat you like choking and calling women names . In bed.â€ The danger in the air thickened until I could almost taste it , and my bravado faltered . Maybe baiting the tiger wasnâ€ ™ t the best ideaâ€ ¦
52718	52874	52714	52714	My	0	â€œMaybeâ€”â€ I wet my lips with my tongue , conscious of his eyes tracking the movement the way a lion would a gazelle . â€œI like those things too.â€ Flames burned away the ice pools in his eyes until the heat seared me to my core . I couldnâ€ ™ t believe Iâ€ ™ d ever thought him cold . In that moment , he was a supernova waiting to erupt and swallow me whole . And Iâ€ ™ d love every second . Alex released me and stood , no trace of the patient , soothing man from earlier tonight in sight . In its place was something hungry and depraved that caused me to tremble with lust . â€œGet up , â€ he said , his voice soft but so commanding I obeyed without thinking . â€œYouâ€ ™ re about to find out what happens when you invite yourself into the lionâ€ ™ s den.â€
53180	53227	53160	53160	her	217	titsâ€”not big , but enough for a handful and tipped with hard , rosy nipples that were perfect for sucking and nibbling . Her chest rose and fell with every breath , and she stared at me with nothing but trust in those big , brown eyes .
53631	53980	53993	53993	her	1367	youâ€”â€ My other hand closed around her throat . â€œHeâ€ ™ ll end up in pieces , and youâ€ ™ ll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember . Do you understand?â€ Her cunt clenched around my fingers . â€œYes.â€ â€œSay it . Who do you belong to?â€ â€œYou , â€ Ava whispered . â€œI belong to you.â€ â€œThatâ€ ™ s right.â€ I slipped my fingers out of her pussy and thrust them into her mouth . I hummed in approval when she sucked and licked her own juices off without my asking . â€œDo you taste that , Sunshine ? Thatâ€ ™ s the taste of you signing your life away . Because from now on , I own you . Body , mind , and soul.â€ Another moan , this one even more eager than the last . I released my hold on her . â€œGet on your knees.â€ She sank to the floor , so beautiful it made my chest hurt and my cock throb . I fisted her hair and tugged it back until she stared straight up at me . â€œIf it gets to be too much , tap my thigh.â€ When she nodded , I tugged her hair harder and ordered , â€œOpen your mouth.â€ I slipped the head of my cock into her waiting mouth , slowly pushing deeper until I was buried all the way down her throat . â€œFuck .â€ The sensation of her mouth engulfing me was so hot a shudder rippled through my entire body , and I almost shot my load right there . I hadnâ€ ™ t done that since I was a teenager having sex for the first time . Ava blinked up at me , her eyes watering from my size and how deep I was , but she didnâ€ ™ t tap out , so I stayed still while she adjusted . After what felt like an eternity but was in actuality a few seconds , she started licking and suckingâ€”slowly
54374	54410	54365	54365	Ava	217	needâ€”oh God.â€ She dropped her head , her squeal muffled by the pillows when I flattened my tongue against her clit , alternating between long , slow licks and fast flicks . I was so fucking hungryâ€”for
54548	54857	54858	54858	I	0	thoughtâ€”youâ€”â€ â€œSunshine , this is a twelve - course meal.â€ I rolled on a condom and slid my already - hard - again cock along her drenched folds . â€œAnd weâ€ ™ re just getting started.â€ I gripped her throat and slammed into her , and all conversation ground to a halt , unless you counted her moans and my grunts as conversation . She felt like heaven to my hell , the closest Iâ€ ™ d ever get to salvation , and yet I still wanted to drag her into the depths of Hades with me . I fucked her so hard I was afraid Iâ€ ™ d break her , but every time I eased up , Ava uttered tiny warning growls that had my lips curving in a mixture of satisfaction and amusement . It turned out my sweet , innocent lamb was actually a dirty little slut in disguise , and Iâ€ ™ d never been happier to be wrong . I flipped her over in time to see her shatter once more , her pleasure - glazed eyes and sighs urging me to go faster and deeper until I , too , came apart in a powerful orgasm that ripped through me with the force of a Category Five hurricane . When my breathing slowed and I came down from my high , I found Ava staring up at me with a strange expression . â€œWhat is it , Sunshine?â€ I brushed my lips over hers , already preparing myself for the next round . If I was going to hell for this , I might as well enjoy every second . â€œNo kissing or face - to - face contact during sex , â€ she murmured . â€œI thought those were your rules.â€ I paused . She was right . Those were my rulesâ€”ones
54889	54919	54883	54883	Iâ€	217	themâ€”until tonight . And I hadnâ€ ™ t even thought about it or realized it until Ava reminded me . I enjoyed fucking from the back more than the average manâ€”there
54938	55018	55064	55064	Iâ€	217	choiceâ€”but Iâ€ ™ d wanted to see her . To watch the way she reacted to each shift in movement , to see her face when she fell apart and screamed my name . And that was when I realized I was well and truly fucked . â€œYouâ€ ™ re right , sweetheart , â€ I said , dropping my forehead to hers with a resigned sigh . So . Fucked . â€œBut the rules donâ€ ™ t apply to you.â€
55197	55369	55156	55156	he	98	nightâ€”if Iâ€ ™ m lucky.â€ I frowned . â€œBut thatâ€ ™ sâ€ ¦ â€ Another huge yawn . â€œNot good.â€ Humans need sleep . How had Alex survived all this time on only a few hours a night ? â€œWe should fix that . Chamomile tea . Meditation . Melatoninâ€ ¦ â€ My voice drifted off . If only my head didnâ€ ™ t feel so heavy and the bed werenâ€ ™ t so comfortable , I could make him tea or find a guided YouTube meditation or something . â€œLetâ€ ™ s talk about it later . Youâ€ ™ re exhausted.â€ He smoothed a hand over my head , and I purred as I nestled into his touch . â€œGood night.â€ My breaths slowed as sleep took over . I thought I felt an arm wrap around my waist and pull me close , but I was out before I could confirm . That night , for the first time in a long time , I slept soundly with no nightmares .
55395	55508	55704	55704	I	0	surfaceâ€”though Iâ€ ™ m not sure â€œchristeningâ€ was the right word to use , considering how filthy our activities were . Sex with Alex was sex like Iâ€ ™ d never known it . Raw . Animalistic . Soul - destroying in the best possible way . It shattered every preconceived notion of who I was and molded me into something darker , more depraved . He called me Sunshine one moment and his whore the next . And I loved it . Even at his coldest , Alex had always treated me with respect outside the bedroom , but inside the bedroom , I was his toy . His to fuck and useâ€”in
55520	55685	55704	55704	I	0	deskâ€”and I craved it as much as he did . I screamed , my core clenching around his cock for what mustâ€ ™ ve been the thousandth time as another orgasm ripped through and broke me into a million pieces of ecstatic agony . When the fog of pleasure finally faded , I found Alex staring down at me with a smirk . â€œWhat?â€ I murmured , too drowsy with content to utter more words . â€œI love watching you come apart.â€ His hands gripped my hips possessively . â€œOnly for me , Sunshine . Never forget that.â€ â€œWhat would you do if I did?â€ Iâ€ ™ d meant it as a tease , but Alexâ€ ™ s eyes glittered with danger as his fingers dug into my flesh . â€œYouâ€ ™ d have a manâ€ ™ s murder on your hands . Is that what you want?â€ He grazed my skin with his nose before he sank his teeth into the side of my neckâ€”punishing
56087	56134	56075	56075	I	0	prepareâ€”though I wasnâ€ ™ t sure anything would prepare us for the shitstorm Josh would unleash once he found out his baby sister and best friend were sleeping together . Which brought me to my next questionâ€ ¦ â€œSo , what exactly will we say ? I meanâ€”â€

56538	56637	56534	56534	I	0	” The unwelcome ring of an incoming call interrupted our obscene symphony of moans and grunts , followed by a cool voice . â€œThis is Alex.â€ My eyes flew open . I gaped at Alex , who stared down at me with a calm expression as he listened to whoever was on the other end of the call . Gone was passionate , playful Alex ; in its place was the composed businessman Alex . â€œNo , Iâ€ ™ m free to talk . What happened with the Wilbur development?â€ Free to talk ? He was still inside me !
57079	57255	57061	57061	Alexâ€	229	armrestâ€”I was on the couch itself , my hips draped over the arm , my face buried in the cushions , my rock - hard nipples and swollen clit scraping against the fabric as he fucked me so viciously my feet lifted off the ground . All the while , he continued his call , taking it off mute only when he had to speak . When he did , his voice remained calm and even , though I could hear his harsh breathing in the moments when he was silent . I had no clue what they were talking about anymore , too lost in a fog of lust to decipher specific words and phrases . An unbidden yelp erupted from my throat when he hit a spot that caused my back to bow . Alex fisted my hair and tugged my head back until I was half - upright again while his other hand closed around my throat . A warning and a reminder rolled into one . Donâ€ ™ t make a sound .
57269	57415	57484	57484	Alex	98	messâ€”I could see it in the window , my tear - streaked face and glazed eyes , my mouth hanging slack as orgasm after orgasm crashed over me in an endless , white - hot wave of sensation . Was it possible to die from too much pleasure ? If so , that was what was happening . I was dying a million tiny deaths , each one ripping me apart and piecing me back together only for the next to destroy me again . Another sob of pleasure , one that had Alex releasing my hair so he could cover my mouth and muffle my whines . One hand over my mouth , one hand around my throat . I came again , my entire body shuddering with the force of my explosion . Alex fucked me harder , deeper , the couch screaming with protestâ€”it
57431	57476	57486	57486	his	98	wallâ€”and I realized it was otherwise quiet . The call was over . â€œI thought you were better at following directions , Sunshine , â€ he said silkily . â€œDidnâ€ ™ t I tell you not to make a sound?â€ I responded with an incoherent mumbleâ€”my
57536	57557	57522	57522	I	0	minutesâ€”hoursâ€”rolled into each other , I lost myself in him . In us . In sweet , filthy , depraved oblivion .
57862	57868	57869	57869	I	0	houseâ€”an hour and a half from Hazelburgâ€”so
58246	58314	58320	58320	My	0	zipliningâ€”he did it all . But now Josh was in Central America , and I realized how little my dad and I had to say to each other . When was the last time weâ€ ™ d had a real , one - on - one conversation ? Probably not since he sat my fourteen - year - old self down and explained what happened with my mother .
58362	58409	58340	58340	Mom	97	timesâ€”a snippet of a lullaby sung in a haunting voice , the splash of water followed by screams and laughs , the burn of a scraped knee after I fell off my bike . Glimpses into the past that were too small and fragmented to mean anything .
59101	59105	59121	59121	Iâ€	106	smilingâ€”even if you were unhappyâ€”could
59402	59517	59379	59382	my real sounding board	1451	problemsâ€”with school , friends , or much to his disgust , boys . It was more than the fact that my dad was an authority figure and Josh was closer to my age . I had no trouble connecting with professors and my friendsâ€ ™ parents . It was something else . Something I couldnâ€ ™ t name . But perhaps thatâ€ ™ s just the nature of Asian parents of a certain age . Itâ€ ™ s not in our culture to show affection openly . We didnâ€ ™ t say I love you or hug all the time like Stellaâ€ ™ s family . Chinese parents show their love through actions , not wordsâ€”working
59954	60209	59948	59948	He	240	Boothâ€”maybe early thirties , with thick black hair , eyes the color of gunmetal , and a broad , muscled frame that towered over Bridgetâ€ ™ s leggy grace , even when she wore heels . Dark stubble shadowed his chin , and a small , jagged scar slashed across his left eyebrow . Without the scar , he wouldâ€ ™ ve been disconcertingly gorgeous ; with it , he was still disconcertingly gorgeous , but also dangerous . More menacing . Good quality to have in a bodyguard , I supposed . â€œItâ€ ™ s a crowd management issue.â€ His voice rumbled through the car , deep and authoritative , even though he was technically Bridgetâ€ ™ s employee . â€œToo many people , too close quarters.â€ Stella , Jules , and I wisely stayed quiet while Bridget matched him glare for glare . â€œItâ€ ™ s a college event . Thereâ€ ™ s bound to be a crowd , and Iâ€ ™ ve never had issues before . Half the people there donâ€ ™ t even know who I am.â€ â€œIt only takes one person one time , â€ Rhys countered , his tone even . â€œOne look and I know the festival is over max capacity.â€ â€œThis is ridiculous . Iâ€ ™ m not entering a war zone , and there are fewer people than at a sports game . No one ever said I couldnâ€ ™ t attend one of those . â€ â€œThe security measures and layout at sports games areâ€”â€
60328	60358	60284	60284	his	240	studentsâ€”decadent hot chocolate and apple cider donuts , pumpkin pies and pulled - pork sandwiches . There were classic games and activities like bobbing for apples , tarot readings , andâ€”because
60361	60380	60428	60428	Bridget	105	collegeâ€”a tailgate where local alumni and students gathered to drink to their heartâ€ ™ s content . Rhys was rightâ€”there
60460	60922	60940	60940	He	1472	blastâ€”for the most part . â€œHeâ€ ™ s driving me crazy , â€ Bridget said a while later in a low voice . She sipped her hot chocolate with a morose expression . â€œI miss Booth.â€ I glanced over my shoulder at Rhys , who followed us with an impassive expression . Either he didnâ€ ™ t hear what she said , or he had the worldâ€ ™ s best poker face . I bet the latter . I had a feeling there wasnâ€ ™ t much , if anything , that Rhys Larsen didnâ€ ™ t see , hear , or notice . â€œItâ€ ™ s his first week.â€ Stella snapped a picture of her drink before tasting it . â€œBooth has been with you for years . Itâ€ ™ s only natural that Rhys would be more overprotective . Give him time.â€ â€œI suppose.â€ Bridget sighed . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know how Nik does it . He has double the security I do because heâ€ ™ s the crown prince , and thereâ€ ™ s so much riding on his shoulders.â€ She shook her head . â€œIâ€ ™ m glad Iâ€ ™ m second in line to the throne.â€ â€œYou mean you donâ€ ™ t want to rule , Your Majesty?â€ I teased . â€œYou could be a queen and see your face on a postage stamp.â€ Bridget laughed . â€œNo , thank you . As tempting as a postage stamp with my face is , Iâ€ ™ d rather have a modicum of freedom.â€ She shot a dark look in Rhysâ€ ™ s direction . â€œUnless my bodyguard has other ideas.â€ â€œHeâ€ ™ s strict , but at least heâ€ ™ s delicious , â€ Jules said in a stage whisper . â€œNo offense to Booth , but whew . â€ She fanned herself . â€œIs that all you think about?â€ Bridget asked , clearly torn between laughter and frustration . A shadow slid across Julesâ€ ™ s face before it disappeared . â€œMost of the time . I like to think about pleasant things . Speaking of whichâ€ ¦ â€ She turned to me . â€œWhereâ€ ™ s Lover Boy?â€ I rolled my eyes , a blush spreading over my cheeks . â€œDonâ€ ™ t call him that , and heâ€ ™ s busy running a company . He doesnâ€ ™ t have time for college events.â€ â€œYou sure about that?â€ Stella tilted her chin at something behind me . I whipped around , my heart jumping in my throat when I saw Alex standing behind me . In his navy cashmere sweater and jeans , he cut a sophisticated figure amongst the crowds of drunk college students and rumpled professors . I couldnâ€ ™ t help itâ€”I
61314	61317	61310	61310	I	0	amusementâ€”he was bleeding â€”and
61715	62101	62108	62108	His	1489	â€œWhaâ€”â€ The sound of fabric tearing answered my incomplete question . Alexâ€ ™ s mouth curled into a sly grin at my shocked expression . â€œSince weâ€ ™ ve established that youâ€ ™ re a screamer , â€ he said . â€œOpen your mouth.â€ My resistance collapsed . I opened my mouth , and he shoved my underwear in , muffling my moan . I shivered when I tasted the slickness of my arousal . I was throbbing now , so turned on I couldnâ€ ™ t see straight . There was something so freakinâ€ ™ erotic about knowing someone could catch us any minute . Alex returned his attention to my breasts while he slid one finger , then two , into my slippery folds . I gripped his hair , tugging so hard it mustâ€ ™ ve hurt as he worked me into a frenzy , but if it did , he didnâ€ ™ t show it . He lifted his head from my chest and watched me with smoldering eyes . â€œThatâ€ ™ s it , Sunshine , â€ he murmured , his muscles taut as he finger fucked me harder . He was knuckles deep inside me now , the obscene sounds of him sliding in and out of my drenched core creating a dirty symphony that intensified my arousal . I rode his hand shamelessly , drool leaking from the corners of my mouth as I screamed around my makeshift gag . â€œCome for me like a little slut.â€ I did . Hard , fast , and endlessly , flying high in an explosion of starry bliss . When I finally came down , I saw that he had unbuttoned his pants and was fisting his cock . It didnâ€ ™ t take long before he erupted , spurting thick , hot jets all over my thighs . â€œNo , â€ he said when I reached to clean myself . He pulled my shredded panties out of my mouth and pocketed them , his movements crisp and precise . â€œI want you to walk around with my cum on you so you know exactly who you belong to.â€ Heat blistered my cheeks . â€œAlex , â€ I hissed . â€œI canâ€ ™ t walk out there with no underwear andâ€ ¦ andâ€”â€
62508	62559	62561	62561	Ava	217	heâ€”â€ â€œAva.â€ He placed his hands on my shoulders . â€œDo you want me to spend Thanksgiving with you?â€ I nodded . â€œThen thatâ€ ™ s what Iâ€ ™ m doing . Donâ€ ™ t overthink it.â€ â€œSays the King of Overthinking , â€ I muttered , but I was smiling .
62720	62974	62718	62719	Chinese parents	2978	likedâ€”he wasnâ€ ™ t one for flattering words . Plus , I was ninety percent sure my dad knew something was up with me and Alex , though he didnâ€ ™ t say anything . â€œHe knows , â€ I whispered when my dad excused himself to use the restroom . â€œI swear , he knows .â€ â€œNo , he doesnâ€ ™ t. Even if he does , he has no proof , and he wonâ€ ™ t say anything to Josh , â€ Alex said . â€œRelax . Itâ€ ™ s supposed to be your weekend off.â€ â€œThereâ€ ™ s no such thing as a weekend off for students.â€ It may have been a holiday , but I had to study for finals and finish my fellowship application . It was all done except for a few paragraphs of my personal statement . Iâ€ ™ d included the photos I took of Alex in my portfolio , though I havenâ€ ™ t told him yet . They were some of my best work , but I didnâ€ ™ t want to say anything until I heard from the WYP committee . I didnâ€ ™ t want to jinx it . â€œItâ€ ™ s too bad weâ€ ™ re not sleeping in the same room.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s eyes glinted . â€œI could help relieve your stress.â€ I laughed . â€œIs that all you think about?â€ Except I wasnâ€ ™ t much better . I wanted to sleep in the same room as Alex tooâ€”especially
63070	63080	63064	63064	Alex	98	lessonsâ€”I panicked way less now than I did at the beginningâ€”and
63365	63384	63363	63363	I	0	terrifiedâ€”more terrified than I had been in a long , long time . Because my dreams were never just dreamsâ€”they
63511	63652	63482	63482	Alexâ€	229	nightâ€”me tucked into his side , his arms wrapped around me in a protective embrace . While I wanted his insomnia cured , wanted him to get the peace and rest he deserved every night , a tiny , shameful part of me liked that he was awake to watch over me in the long hours between dusk and dawn . He was probably awake , but I forced myself to stay put in case he wasnâ€ ™ t. I didnâ€ ™ t want to risk interrupting the two or three precious hours of sleep he got every night . I crawled back beneath my covers and tried to catch more shuteye , but my skin itched , and something called to me beyond the walls . I resisted for as long as I could , until twilight melted into dawn .
63813	63909	63781	63781	My	0	lakeâ€”close enough to smell the damp earth beneath my feet . It was the first time I remembered visiting the lake . Iâ€ ™ d shied away from it growing up , going only as far as the barbecue seating area . Even then , Iâ€ ™ d get so nervous I would excuse myself halfway through parties and run to the bathroom to bring myself under control . I wasnâ€ ™ t sure what compelled me to come out here this morning , but the lakeâ€ ™ s siren song enveloped me , coaxing me closerâ€”like

64048	64051	64043	64043	I	0	floweryâ€”Mommyâ€ ™ s perfumeâ€”and
64107	64129	64105	64105	I	0	forwardâ€”down , down , off the edge of the deck , my scream swallowed up by the water rushing toward my face .

64948	65013	64930	64930	Ava	217	â€œIâ€”â€ She gulped , her eyes haunted . â€œMy childhood memories . They came back.â€ The confession hit me like a freight train , blindsiding me . Of all the things Iâ€ ™ d expected her to say , that had not been one of them . Repressed memories were usually the result of a traumatic event and could resurface if the person encountered a triggerâ€”a
65205	65212	65177	65177	She	217	Incidentâ€”thatâ€ ™ s what I call what happenedâ€”but
65336	65432	65330	65331	My mom	371	sunscreenâ€”said it was the most important thing we could do for our skin . I didnâ€ ™ t want to stop playing to go with her , so she made me promise to stay put while she ran inside . She was supposed to be gone for only a few minutes.â€ Ava traced the rim of the mug with her finger , her eyes gaining that far - off quality that told me she was lost in her unearthed memories . â€œI did . I stayed put . Watched the fish , threw stones in the waterâ€”I
65521	65522	65496	65496	She	371	nightmaresâ€”my memoriesâ€”I
65742	65750	65737	65737	Iâ€	217	elseâ€”something that cemented my fatherâ€ ™ s guilt .

66254	66260	66293	66293	Alex	98	loudâ€”my father tried to kill me â€”mustâ€
66329	66363	66317	66317	I	0	upâ€”â€ â€œDonâ€ ™ t worry about it.â€ He ran a gentle hand over my hair , but an inferno raged in his eyes . â€œWeâ€ ™ ll figure everything out . Leave it to me.â€
66762	66776	66778	66778	I	0	â€œIâ€”â€ The door opened , and my words died in my throat . My fatherâ€”Michael
66788	67030	67031	67031	I	0	anymoreâ€”walked in , looking confused and a little annoyed . He wore his favorite striped polo and jeans again , as well as that damn signet ring . I choked back bile . Beside me , Alex tensed , wrath radiating from him in dark , dangerous waves . â€œWhatâ€ ™ s going on?â€ Michael frowned . â€œAva ? Why did you ask me to come here?â€ â€œMr . Chen.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s voice seemed pleasant enough ; only those who knew him could detect the lethal blade beneath his words , waiting to strike . â€œPlease , take a seat.â€ He gestured at the leather chair on the other side of the table . Michael did , his expression growing more irritated . â€œI have work to do , and you made me come all the way to D.C. for a supposed emergency.â€ â€œI sent a car , â€ Alex said , still in that deceptively pleasant tone . â€œYour car or mine , it takes the same amount of time.â€ Michaelâ€ ™ s eyes flicked between Alex and me before settling on me . â€œDonâ€ ™ t tell me youâ€ ™ re pregnant.â€ Confirmation he knew Alex and I had been an item at Thanksgiving . Not that I cared what he thought anymore . â€œNo.â€ I raised my voice so I could hear it over my pounding pulse . â€œIâ€ ™ m not.â€ â€œThen whatâ€ ™ s the emergency?â€ â€œIâ€”â€
67040	67142	67034	67034	Alex	98	â€œIâ€”â€ I couldnâ€ ™ t say it . Not with an audience . Alex already knew everything , but what Michael and I had to discuss seemed too personal to air out in front of other people . It was between us . Father and daughter . Pinpricks of light danced before my vision . I dug the nails of my free hand into my thigh so hard I wouldâ€ ™ ve drawn blood had I not been wearing jeans . â€œAlex , can you let us have a moment alone , please?â€ His head whipped toward me , his expression thunderous .
67180	67190	67191	67191	he	1603	faceâ€”my unshakeable belief that I had to fight my own battlesâ€”because
67459	67490	67516	67516	you	1603	knowâ€”I wasnâ€ ™ t wrong . He really had tried to kill me . â€œReally?â€ His chuckle sounded forced . â€œAre you sure ? Youâ€ ™ ve been having nightmares for yearsâ€”â€
67803	68322	67768	67768	your	0	sawâ€”â€ Michael swallowed hard . â€œIt was the worst few minutes of my life , thinking you were dead . I jumped in and saved you , and all the while your motherâ€ ¦ she just stood there in shock . Like she couldnâ€ ™ t believe what had happened.â€ His voice dropped . â€œYour mother wasnâ€ ™ t well , Ava . She didnâ€ ™ t mean to harm you , but sometimes she did things out of her control . She felt so guilty afterward , and between the divorce and criminal chargesâ€ ¦ thatâ€ ™ s why she overdosed.â€ Pain ripped through my head . I pressed my fingers to my temples , trying to sort through my fatherâ€ ™ s words and my own memories . What was real ? What wasnâ€ ™ t ? Memories were unreliable . I knew that . And Michael sounded sincere . But had I really been that off base ? Where did those visions come from , if not my memories ? â€œThereâ€ ™ s another instance , â€ I said shakily . â€œThird grade . I brought home an essay from Mrs. Jamesâ€ ™ s class and showed you . We were in your office . You looked at me and said I was a carbon copy of Mom and youâ€ ¦ you pushed a pillow into my face and tried to suffocate me . I couldnâ€ ™ t breathe . I wouldâ€ ™ ve died , but Josh came home and called for you , and you stopped.â€ The story sounded ridiculous beneath the bright lights of the conference room . My head pounded harder . Alarm spread across Michaelâ€ ™ s features . â€œAva , â€ he said softly , calmly , like he didnâ€ ™ t want to spook me . â€œYou never had a teacher named Mrs. James.â€ My heart crashed against my chest . â€œI did ! She had blonde hair and glasses , and she gave us sugar cookies on our birthdaysâ€ ¦ â€ Tears prickled my eyes . â€œI swear , Mrs. James was real.â€ She had to be real . But what if she wasnâ€ ™ t ? What if Iâ€ ™ d made everything up and thought they were memories ? What was wrong with me ? Why was my brain so messed up ? I couldnâ€ ™ t breathe . I felt crazy , like nothing in my life was real and Iâ€ ™ d dreamed it all up . I pressed my palms into the table , half - expecting it to dissolve in a shower of dust . â€œHoneyâ€ ¦ â€ He reached for me , but before he could touch me , the door banged open . â€œThatâ€ ™ s enough . Stop lying.â€ Alex strode in , his face like thunder . Of course he had this place wired . â€œI had my people investigate after Ava told me what she remembered , â€ he said coldly . He did ? He never told me that . â€œYouâ€ ™ d be surprised how muchâ€”and
68324	68345	67768	67768	your	0	quicklyâ€”one can find out with the right amount of money . She did have a third - grade teacher named Mrs. Jamesâ€”one
68723	68814	68704	68704	Michael	141	truthâ€”youâ€ ™ re not really my daughter.â€ He flashed a humorless smile at my sharp intake of breath . â€œThatâ€ ™ s right . Your bitch of a mom cheated on me . Mustâ€ ™ ve been one of those times I was away for business . She always complained I wasnâ€ ™ t around enough , like it wasnâ€ ™ t my fucking business that put the roof over her head and kept her nice and warm in designer clothes . Iâ€ ™ d always suspected you werenâ€ ™ t mineâ€”you
69274	69278	69286	69286	He	0	seeâ€”I didnâ€ ™ t rememberâ€”â€
69401	69649	69394	69394	Iâ€	106	forâ€”at 4:44 a.m. , no less . The unluckiest time.â€ My stomach lurched . 4:44 a.m. The time I awoke from my nightmares . Iâ€ ™ ve never been a superstitious person , but I couldnâ€ ™ t help wondering if that had been my mom screaming at me from the other side , urging me to remember . To leave the sociopath whose house Iâ€ ™ d been living in all these years . â€œWhat about that day in your office?â€ I asked , determined to see this through even though I wanted to throw up . Michael snorted . â€œRight . That stupid essay about how I â€˜savedâ€ ™ you . You know , I did a pretty good job of hiding how much I resented having to raise you , the â€˜daughterâ€ ™ whoâ€ ™ s not even my own , all those years . I played the role of the quiet , awkward , grief - stricken father to a tee.â€ His ugly smile reappeared . â€œBut sometimes , you push my limits , especially since you look so much like her . A living reminder of her infidelity . It wouldâ€ ™ ve been so easy if you were out of the picture , but Josh chose that moment to come home . Alas.â€ He lifted his shoulder in a shrug . â€œCanâ€ ™ t have it all . To be fair , the office incident was a moment of weakness on my partâ€”you
69836	69840	69828	69829	Heâ€ ™	111	timeâ€”too young to help meâ€”and
70032	70146	70149	70150	â€ Alex	98	Avaâ€”â€ He gestured at me . â€œConsented beforehand . Youâ€ ™ re going to jail for a long , long time.â€ Michaelâ€ ™ s mask of malice melted , leaving behind the â€œfatherâ€ who took me on college visits and planned my birthday parties again . It was terrifying how easily he switched between the two . â€œIf I have to go to jail to save her , I will , â€ he whispered . He turned to me , his eyes shining with actual tears . â€œAva , honey , Alex is not who you think he is . His driver picked me up , and on the way here , he threatened meâ€”â€
70301	70420	70295	70295	he	0	authorityâ€”â€ â€œAu contraire , I worked with the FBI on that part . My friends at the agency were quite interested in what I had to say , and what they found.â€ Alex smiled . â€œYou can use your untainted assets to hire an attorney , but most of your assets are tainted and will be frozen before your trial . Youâ€ ™ ll receive the official notice before the end of today.â€ â€œJosh will never forgive you for this.â€ Michaelâ€ ™ s eyes burned . â€œHe worships me . Who do you think heâ€ ™ ll believe ? Me , his father , or you , a punk he met a few years ago?â€ â€œIn this case , Fatherâ€”â€
70585	70593	70582	70582	I	0	veâ€”â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s not your fault . Dadâ€”Michaelâ€”fooled
70809	71068	70801	70801	Josh	106	ourâ€”hisâ€”father , had Alex not finally pulled him back . The FBI agents hauled a bruised and bleeding Michael into custody , and now we awaited his trial . Thanks to Alex , whose friendâ€ ™ s father was apparently high up in the FBI , Josh didnâ€ ™ t get charged with assault for attacking Michael . The entire situation felt surreal . â€œEither way , it wasnâ€ ™ t your fault , â€ I repeated . â€œYou were just a kid too.â€ â€œIf Iâ€ ™ d been there that day in his officeâ€ ¦ â€ â€œStop it . Do you hear me , Josh Chen?â€ I said sternly . â€œI will not let you blame yourself . Mom and Michael were adults . They made their own choices.â€ I swallowed , feeling guilty about my suppressed rage toward my mother over the years when , in fact , sheâ€ ™ d been a victim too . â€œYouâ€ ™ ve always been there when I needed you , and you are an amazing brother . Iâ€ ™ ll only say that once , so donâ€ ™ t ask me to repeat it . Your ego doesnâ€ ™ t need more inflation.â€ He cracked a small smile . â€œAre you going to be okay?â€ I took a deep breath . The past two weeks had beenâ€ ¦ a lot . The revelations , the mind fucks , the sinking realization that I was practically an orphan . My mother was dead , my father wasnâ€ ™ t my real fatherâ€”and
71077	71232	70801	70801	Josh	106	timeâ€”and I had no clue who my actual father was . But at least I knew the truth , and I had Josh , Alex , and my friends . Maybe the import of what happened would hit me later , but for now , all I felt was relief mingled with sadness and lingering shock . â€œYeah , â€ I said . â€œI will.â€ Josh mustâ€ ™ ve heard my conviction , because his shoulders relaxed the tiniest bit . â€œIf you need to talk or anything , Iâ€ ™ m here . Canâ€ ™ t guarantee Iâ€ ™ ll give good advice , but Iâ€ ™ ll be a sounding board or whatever.â€ I smiled . â€œThanks , Joshy.â€ He made a face at his hated nickname . â€œHow many times do I have to tell you ? Donâ€ ™ t call me that.â€ We spent the next half hour talking about lighter topicsâ€”his
72144	72654	72141	72141	he	197	herâ€”and she always ignored him , like she did now . Bridget refused to look at him as she lowered the volume on Mean Girls . That mustâ€ ™ ve been the thousandth time weâ€ ™ d watched it , but it never got old . Regina George was iconic . â€œI will . Heâ€ ™ s likely another Internet weirdo.â€ Stella made a face . â€œThatâ€ ™ s why I never post my Stories until after Iâ€ ™ ve left a place.â€ I couldnâ€ ™ t imagine documenting my life online the way Stella did . I worried for both her physical safety and mental health sometimes , but sheâ€ ™ d handled it well so far . Maybe I was just being a worrywart . Someone knocked on the door . â€œIâ€ ™ ll get it.â€ Rhys unfolded himself to his full six feet , five inches . Seriously , the man was enormous . He probably wore custom - made clothes because no way would an off - the - rack shirt fit those big shoulders and broad chest . â€œLook at that ass.â€ Jules sighed . â€œTalk about a tight end.â€ â€œStop objectifying him . Thatâ€ ™ s Bridgetâ€ ™ s bodyguard , â€ I said , nudging her in the ribs . â€œExactly . Bodyguards are hot . Donâ€ ™ t you think so , Bridge?â€ â€œNo , â€ Bridget said flatly . â€œYou guys are no fun.â€ Jules twisted her red hair into a messy topknot . â€œOoh , look who comes bearing gifts.â€ My stomach fluttered when Alex walked in with Rhys on his heels . He carried a distinctive black - and - white striped box . â€œCake?â€ Stella perked up . Sheâ€ ™ d warmed up to Alex over the past month after seeing he was â€œcapable of human emotion after all.â€ â€œCupcakes , â€ Alex confirmed , setting the goodies on the table . My friends dove for the box like treasure hunters diving for gold . I smiled and tilted my head up so I could kiss him . â€œThank you . You didnâ€ ™ t have to do that.â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s just cupcakes.â€ He returned my kiss before sitting next to me and curling a protective arm around my waist . â€œFigured you could use the sugar rush.â€ I peeled the wrapper away from my red velvet cupcake with a small frown . It would take a long time to get over what Michael did . I wasnâ€ ™ t sure I would ever get over what Michael did . My entire life was a lie . Sometimes , Iâ€ ™ d lie awake at night , so anxious I couldnâ€ ™ t sleep or think straight . Other times , like now , Iâ€ ™ d look around me and comfort myself with the knowledge that I would be all right . That old saying was true : what doesnâ€ ™ t kill you makes you stronger . Iâ€ ™ d almost died twice in my lifeâ€”that
72657	72992	73260	73260	his	1701	ofâ€”and I was still standing . Iâ€ ™ d continue to stand tall , long after Michael rotted in jail . Thanks to a nudge from Alex , who knew half the judges in this town , Michael was locked up with no bail until his court date . Heâ€ ™ d sent a message asking me to see him , but I refused . I had nothing left to say to him . Heâ€ ™ d shown me his real face , and I would be happy if I never saw it again for the rest of my life . But yeah , sometimes a girl needed a cupcake or two to get her through the rainy days . Part of me was grateful Michael and I had never been close . If we had , I wasnâ€ ™ t sure Iâ€ ™ d be able to take the heartbreak . That was why I worried about Josh , who was his real son and whoâ€ ™ d had a much closer relationship with him . But Josh insisted he was fine , and there was no arguing with him . He was even more stubborn than me . We ate in silence for a while before Stella cleared her throat . â€œUm , thanks for the treat , but I should head out . I have a brand collab I need to shoot.â€ â€œMe , too , â€ Bridget added , picking up on Stellaâ€ ™ s cue . â€œI have a political theory paper to write.â€ After Stella , Bridget , and Rhys beat a hasty retreat , Jules announced she had a date tonight and needed to get ready . She swept up the stairs , taking half the remaining cupcakes with her . â€œYou know how to clear a room , â€ I teased , running an absentminded hand down Alexâ€ ™ s arm . What would I do without him ? Not only had he helped me confront my fatherâ€”I
72995	73213	73260	73260	his	1701	Michaelâ€”but he was helping me deal with the aftermath , including all the financial and legal webs I was now tangled up in . Most of Michaelâ€ ™ s assets had been frozen , but luckily , heâ€ ™ d already paid my tuition for the year , and I had a steady income from my job and side gig . The commission I received for selling the Richard Argus piece to Alex helped too . Josh , whoâ€ ™ d received a full - ride scholarship plus living stipend for the duration of med school , was also set money - wise . At least that was one less thing we had to worry about . â€œItâ€ ™ s one of my many talents.â€ Alex captured my mouth in a searing kiss , and I melted into him , letting his tongue and taste and touch carry me away to a land where my troubles didnâ€ ™ t exist . God , I loved this man , and he didnâ€ ™ t even know it . Not yet . My pulse thundered in my ears when we pulled apart . â€œAlexâ€ ¦ â€ â€œHmm?â€ He brushed his fingers over my skin , his gaze still locked on my mouth . â€œI have something to tell you . Iâ€”â€
73409	73521	73397	73397	I	0	sayâ€”againâ€”is , I love you , Alex Volkov . Every part of you , even the parts I want to slap.â€ A smile ghosted his mouth . â€œThat was quite the speech.â€ The smile faded as quickly as it had come , and he dropped his forehead to mine , his breath ragged . â€œYou are the light to my dark , Sunshine , â€ he said in a raw voice . His lips brushed against mine as he spoke . â€œWithout you , Iâ€ ™ m lost.â€ Our kiss was even deeper this time , more urgent , but his response played on a loop in the back of my mind .

Thatâ€ ™ s it?â€ He switched topics so abruptly it took me half a second longer than usual to respond . â€œNo.â€ I wasnâ€ ™ t done with the man Iâ€ ™ d destroyed . Not yet . â€œThereâ€ ™ s more.â€ I had one final ace up my sleeve . I wanted to take everything from the man whoâ€ ™ d taken everything from me . His business , his family , his life .

I checked the sections for his favorite authors . Fyodor Dostoyevsky , Taras Shevchenko , Leo Tolstoy , Alexander Dovzhenkoâ€ ¦ he had a soft spot for Russian and Ukrainian classics . Said they grounded him in his roots . But no , all the books were real . My eyes flitted over the rest of the library and landed on the limited - edition chess set in the corner . The pieces were still arranged in the same pattern from our last game . While I examined the set and the surrounding area for anything that could give credence to my suspicions , I knocked against the table , and a pawn tumbled to the floor . I cursed under my breath and bent to pick it up . As I did , my eyes snagged on the outlet beneath the table . It was a simple , ordinary outlet , exceptâ€ ¦ My gaze traveled to the left . There was another outlet , less than a foot away . The U.S. National Electrical Code stipulated outlets must be positioned no more than six feet apart measured along the floor line , but it was rare to see two so close together . I paused , listening for any noisesâ€”the
77494	77511	77486	77486	My	0	papersâ€”right as an engine roared in the distance . My uncle was home . I unfolded the documentsâ€”letters

I shoved the letters into the wall , folding them the way Iâ€ ™ d found them , and screwed the outlet cover back on . I crawled out from beneath the table , placed the pawn in the same position itâ€ ™ d been in before I knocked it over , and pocketed both the paper clip and my gloves , which were sleek enough that they didnâ€ ™ t create a visible bulge in my pants . I plucked The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumasâ€”one
77722	77777	77780	77780	He	1826	booksâ€”off the shelf on my way to the door . â€œAlex , â€ my uncle said when he saw me in the hall . He chuckled . â€œDumas again ? You canâ€ ™ t get enough of that book.â€ I smiled . â€œNo , I canâ€ ™ t.â€ All the while , my blood raged .

But I saw you and remembered youâ€ ™ re a photographer , so I figured itâ€ ™ s a sign.â€ Elliott flashed a sheepish smile . â€œHope this doesnâ€ ™ t sound creepy , but I pulled up your website and showed it to Sally , and she loves your pictures . If youâ€ ™ re free in the next few weeks , weâ€ ™ d love to hire you.â€ I spotted a pretty blonde at a neighboring table watching us . She grinned and waved at me . I waved back . â€œCongrats , â€ I said , my smile genuine this time . â€œIâ€ ™ d love to help . Give me your number , and we can sort out details later.â€ While we exchanged contact information , an icy voice sliced through the din of the restaurant . â€œYouâ€ ™ re in my way.â€ Alex stood behind Elliott , pinning him with a glare so dark I was surprised the poor man didnâ€ ™ t disintegrate into ashes . â€œOh , sorryâ€”â€
78916	79069	78914	78914	my	0	genesâ€”one sip of alcohol , especially red wine , and I turn the color of a tomato . I waited until the server brought out our entrees before I revealed my big news . â€œI heard back from the photography fellowship today.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s fork paused halfway to his mouth . â€œI got in.â€ I bit my lower lip , my chest wild with the drumbeat of excitement and nerves . â€œNew York . I got in.â€ â€œI knew you would.â€ Simple and matter of fact , like heâ€ ™ d never doubted me , but Alexâ€ ™ s eyes shone with pride . â€œCongratulations , Sunshine.â€ He leaned across the table and pressed a kiss to my lips . I was so giddy I couldnâ€ ™ t stop grinning , and my earlier irritation melted away . So what if heâ€ ™ d been a little late ? I got in !
79396	79574	79613	79613	My	0	howâ€”â€ Something buzzed . Alex stiffened , and my eyes dropped to his coat pocket , which buzzed again . My grin faded . â€œYou said your phone died.â€ Just like that , the tension returned , simmering in the air until it became a full - on boil . The night was an emotional rollercoaster , and I couldnâ€ ™ t keep up . â€œI charged it in the car.â€ Alex sipped his wine , his shoulders tense . â€œBut you didnâ€ ™ t reply to any of my messages or calls.â€ I tucked my hands beneath my thighs , suddenly cold even though the heat was on . â€œWhy were you really late , Alex?â€ â€œI told you , I had urgent business to take care of.â€ â€œThatâ€ ™ s not good enough.â€ â€œI donâ€ ™ t know what you want me to tell you.â€ â€œThe truth ! â€ I lowered my voice when the diners at the next table shot me an alarmed look . â€œThatâ€ ™ s all I want . Please . My fathâ€”Michael
79617	79690	79691	79691	He	229	â€œAlexâ€”â€ â€œPlausible deniability exists for a reason , Sunshine.â€ He cut into his pasta with more force than necessary . â€œWhat did you do?â€ I whispered . Alex tightened his grip on his fork . â€œIâ€ ™ m not always a good person . I donâ€ ™ t always do the right thing . You know that , even if you seem determined to see the good in me . I wonâ€ ™ tâ€”â€
79745	79796	79743	79743	my	0	â€œSunshineâ€”â€ He reached for me , but I shrugged him off and ran out before he could stop me . My chest felt tight as I speed - walked home . What shouldâ€ ™ ve been one of the best nights of my life had turned into one of the worst .
80046	80106	80002	80003	The men	1761	outâ€”the camp posted a list of its attendees online every year . Iâ€ ™ d kept the knowledge of their true motives to myself though . Iâ€ ™ d been young , but old enough to know the criminal justice system wouldnâ€ ™ t deliver the type of justice I craved : total annihilation . So Iâ€ ™ d waited .
80317	80573	80315	80315	Ava	99	rightâ€”Iâ€ ™ d been distracted this past week , busy with my chess game . Not the unfinished one with my uncle in the library , but the one playing out in real life . Iâ€ ™ d had my tech guy hack into Ivanâ€ ™ s financial records dating back to my familyâ€ ™ s deaths and paid him a hefty sum to work day and night until he found what Iâ€ ™ d expected to find all along . A large sum of money had been wired from one of my uncleâ€ ™ s secret offshore accounts to an anonymous account two days before my familyâ€ ™ s death , and another equal sum had been sent the day after . An even larger amount had been sent to a second anonymous account the day after the â€œburglarsâ€ died . Iâ€ ™ d paid the hacker another eye - watering sum to track down the second killer . Heâ€ ™ d contacted me when I was on my way to meet Ava , saying heâ€ ™ d located the person , a notorious killer for hire who went by the name of Falcon . Theyâ€ ™ d apparently retired , but I didnâ€ ™ t need their â€œskills.â€ I only needed a name . As a gesture of goodwill , Iâ€ ™ d wired Falcon twenty - five percent of the fifty grand Iâ€ ™ d promised them if they would confirm who hired them to kill the burglars . Now , I waited .
80842	80943	80840	80840	I	0	cookedâ€”why waste my time doing something I didnâ€ ™ t enjoy and which I could pay other people to do ? But I made an exception today . I was waiting for a visitor , and I didnâ€ ™ t want to miss them by eating out . The doorbell rang . 9:07 a.m. , according to the clock on my microwave . Earlier than Iâ€ ™ d expected , which meant he was eager . I shut off the stove and sipped my tea as I answered the door . When I did , I had to mask my surprise .
81064	81068	81094	81095	â€ Ava	107	Christmasâ€”in secret , no lessâ€”but
81310	81331	81337	81337	Josh	106	longerâ€”â€ She exhaled a sharp breath , her face tinting red . â€œJust tell me . Donâ€ ™ t string me along.â€
81367	81372	81421	81421	Ava	107	regionâ€”he was okay , thank Godâ€”and
81493	81600	81469	81469	I	0	Iâ€”â€ â€œAlex.â€ My uncleâ€ ™ s pleasant tone belied the fury simmering in his eyes . When Ava turned , startled , he smoothed his face into a gracious smile . â€œWhoâ€ ™ s this lovely creature?â€ If the mug were glass , it wouldâ€ ™ ve cracked by now . â€œAva , Uncle Ivan , â€ I responded , voice clipped . â€œAh , the infamous Ava . How lovely to meet you , dear.â€ She smiled , looking uncomfortable . â€œI didnâ€ ™ t realize you were expecting company , â€ she told me . â€œUm , youâ€ ™ re right . We can talk laterâ€”â€
81665	82225	81632	81632	your	166	roomâ€”Ava and I on one side , Ivan on the other . Tension laced the air . â€œAnyone want a drink?â€ I set my near - empty mug on the table . â€œTea ? Hot chocolate?â€ Ava shook her head . â€œNo , thanks.â€ â€œGreen tea for me.â€ Ivan patted his stomach . I returned a few minutes later with his drink and found him in deep conversation with Ava . â€œâ€ ¦ Thanksgiving weekend?â€ My uncle took the tea from me with an oily smile . â€œAlex , Ava was telling me about how you spent your Thanksgiving . He loves his holidays with the Chens , â€ he told her . â€œHe finds them soâ€ ¦ enlightening.â€ My muscles burned from how tense I was while Ava returned his smile with her own uncertain one . â€œWhat can I do for you , uncle?â€ I asked , taking my seat with careful nonchalance . â€œIt must be important if youâ€ ™ re here this early . Long drive from Philly.â€ â€œI wanted to congratulate my favorite nephew.â€ Ivanâ€ ™ s smile tightened . I didnâ€ ™ t bother pointing out I was his only nephew . â€œAva , dear , did you know youâ€ ™ re sitting next to the new CEO of Archer Group?â€ I betrayed no emotion while Avaâ€ ™ s head whipped toward me , her eyes wide . â€œMy uncle graciously stepped aside , â€ I said . I addressed Ivan . â€œIâ€ ™ m grateful for your tutelage and all the years youâ€ ™ ve dedicated to the company , but now you can retire and indulge in fishing , crossword puzzles , TV dramasâ€ ¦ a life of leisure , just like you deserve.â€ â€œYes , â€ he said coldly . â€œIâ€ ™ m looking forward to it.â€ It was all bullshit , this show we were putting on . My uncle didnâ€ ™ t resign , though that would be the official story we fed to the press . Heâ€ ™ d toppled from power thanks to the secret boardroom coup Iâ€ ™ d spent the past week executing . Iâ€ ™ d had to use more dirty tricks than usual to get it done in such a short time , but anger is the worldâ€ ™ s greatest motivator . I was now CEO of Archer Group , and Ivan was nothing . After I finished with him , he wouldnâ€ ™ t have anything , either . â€œCongratulations . Thatâ€ ™ s amazing.â€ Ava looked genuinely happy for me , but she also sounded confused and a little hurt , probably because I hadnâ€ ™ t mentioned something so huge to her . Then again , the changeover hadnâ€ ™ t been official until yesterday afternoon . No doubt the board notified Ivan , and heâ€ ™ d driven here first thing in the morning , intent on reaming me out . He didnâ€ ™ t take his eyes off me as he said , â€œYou and Ava should visit one day . Iâ€ ™ m an old man who doesnâ€ ™ t have many friends , and I donâ€ ™ t like to leave the house much.â€ He chuckled . â€œIâ€ ™ m a bit paranoid about security , you see . I have cameras all over my homeâ€”my

Iâ€ ™ d known all along how narcissistic my uncle could be , and my motherâ€ ™ s rejection mustâ€ ™ ve hit hardâ€”hard
83110	83297	83107	83107	I	0	Iâ€”â€ She paused , pink blossoming on her cheeks . â€œI loved you?â€ â€œOf course not.â€ I tightened my hold and kissed her . â€œYou know Iâ€ ™ d do anything for you.â€ â€œOkay , because you started acting weird right afterâ€ ¦ â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s work , â€ I lied . â€œIâ€ ™ ve been stressed about the CEO transition.â€ Also partly true . It was a testament to Avaâ€ ™ s trust that she took my words at face value . â€œYouâ€ ™ ll be a great CEO.â€ She brushed her lips over a sensitive spot on my neck , and my cock jumped with interest . I hadnâ€ ™ t touched her in a week , and I was dying to tie her down and have my way with her . â€œNow , how about we alleviate that stressâ€ ¦ â€ I responded with a wicked grin . â€œI like the way you think.â€ But as I carried her upstairs and fucked her in every position until she couldnâ€ ™ t scream anymore , the sense of impending doom hovering over me remained .
83359	83661	83685	83685	he	0	visitâ€”Iâ€ ™ d been expecting it . I called my assistant and told her to cancel the rest of my meetings for the day and made it to Philadelphia in two hours flat . I slowed my steps as I walked up the stairs to my uncleâ€ ™ s office , sure he had cameras monitoring my every move since I pulled up to the estateâ€ ™ s gates . I found him sitting behind his desk , watching his beloved Russian drama on the TV . â€œHello , uncle.â€ I leaned against the wall and stuffed my hands in my pockets , the picture of casual indifference . Ivanâ€ ™ s eye twitched . â€œSo you finally made it , you little shit.â€ I suppressed a smile . My uncle rarely cursed ; he must have been out of his mind with anger . I could see why ; he looked horrible . I spotted a bald spot in his hair , as well as scaly red patches and a few nasty - looking pustular eruptions on his skin . His face looked haggard , his complexion wan . For someone as vain as my uncle , the deterioration of his looks must be a living nightmare . â€œIâ€ ™ ll always make time to visit my favorite uncle.â€ My only uncle , though not for much longer . â€œYou donâ€ ™ t look so well . Stressed over losing your job?â€ A muscle ticked in his jaw . â€œYouâ€ ™ re handing the CEO position back to me.â€ I almost laughed out loud . â€œWhy would I do that?â€ â€œBecause.â€ Ivan leaned back and laced his hands over his stomach . â€œI have something you want , and I have a feeling youâ€ ™ ll do anything to get it backâ€”including

I would give her up if it meant saving her . â€œThatâ€ ™ s where youâ€ ™ re wrong , â€ I drawled , keeping my gaze locked on Ivanâ€ ™ s. â€œYou underestimate me , uncle . She was never more than a pawn in my game . Why do you think I pulled back after her father went to jail ? She was useless to me after that . I admit , the sex was good.â€ I shrugged . â€œThat was the only reason I didnâ€ ™ t cut her off entirely.â€ I saw Avaâ€ ™ s head jerk up out of the corner of my eye . â€œSorry , Sunshine.â€ I forced myself to inject a mocking lilt into her nickname . â€œThe catâ€ ™ s out of the bag , so I might as well tell you the whole story . The man I told you about , the one who murdered my parents ? That was your fatherâ€”well

They eventually reached a truce , but Michael made an easy scapegoat . It didnâ€ ™ t take much to plant â€˜evidenceâ€ ™ that an impressionable teen like yourself would believe.â€ Ivan coughed . â€œYouâ€ ™ re a smart kid , but your desire for vengeance blinded you . I always hated the man , anyway . He humiliated me once at a party your father invited him to as a â€˜gesture of goodwillâ€ ™ â€”even
85360	85507	85254	85254	Theyâ€	201	toâ€”and I wasnâ€ ™ t surprised to learn Michaelâ€ ™ s a psychopath as well.â€ â€œYouâ€ ™ re one to talk , â€ I said coldly . My uncle would be deranged enough to hold on to a grudge over some slight at a party that happened decades ago . Iâ€ ™ d gone to painstaking lengths to ensure Michael wouldnâ€ ™ t know of Ivanâ€ ™ s nor my connection with my father , because he wouldnâ€ ™ t exactly welcome the son of the man heâ€ ™ d murdered ( or so I thought ) into his home . Iâ€ ™ d changed our last names and erased any evidence that would tie us to Anton Dudik . My uncle and I had been born Ivan and Alex Dudik ; we were now Ivan and Alex Volkov . I was lucky my uncle was so paranoidâ€”there
85623	85680	85681	85681	I	0	humansâ€”believing the best of someone simply because they were there for you at your worst . He was my only living relative left , and Iâ€ ™ d let that color my perception of him . Now , because of my fuckup , Ava was hurt . My stomach clenched . I kept my gaze averted from herâ€”if

86597	86645	86581	86581	Ivanâ€	263	saidâ€”â€ â€œThat you had Guillain - Barre disease?â€ I sighed . â€œIt is unfortunate that the symptoms are so similar . But no , Iâ€ ™ m afraid itâ€ ™ s not Guillain - Barre.â€ â€œWhat did you do , you little shit?â€ A flash of movement behind Camoâ€”visible
86650	86765	86766	86766	I	0	stoodâ€”caught my eye . I showed no reaction even as my mental calculations adjusted to account for the new development . â€œYou can buy anything on the black market these days , â€ I said , playing idly with the ugly monkey paperweight on the desk . â€œIncluding deadly poisons . The one currently destroying your system ? Quite similar to thallium . Itâ€ ™ s odorless , tasteless , colorless . Hard to identify because itâ€ ™ s so rare , and its symptoms often point to a range of other illnesses . But unlike thallium , it has no widely known antidote . Luckily for you , Uncle , there is a secret antidoteâ€”and
86892	86988	86881	86881	he	128	tableauâ€”Rhys with one arm around Camoâ€ ™ s neck and the other pressing a gun to his temple ; Ava and Bridget wriggling out of their restraints , me ready to shoot my uncle point - blank in the chest . â€œAlex.â€ Ivan let out a nervous chuckle . â€œMy dear nephew , is this necessary ? We are , after all , family.â€ â€œNo , weâ€ ™ re not . You murdered my family.â€ I cocked my gun , and he paled . â€œAva , Bridget , leave the room.â€ They didnâ€ ™ t move .
87057	87168	87182	87182	my	0	birthâ€”â€ The shot rang out loud and clear over his pleas . Ivan froze , his mouth hanging open in shock . A crimson stain bloomed across his chest . â€œUnfortunately for you , Iâ€ ™ m not someone who waxes poetic before I pull the trigger , â€ I said . I felt no hint of remorse for the man whoâ€ ™ d raised me . He was a murderer and a liar . I was too , but Iâ€ ™ d resigned myself to hell a long time ago . â€œYouâ€ ™ ll die today , looking as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside.â€ â€œYou ungratefulâ€”â€
87192	87208	87209	87209	I	0	Thisâ€”â€ A third shot . â€œIs for Nina . For Ava . For Bridget . And thisâ€”â€
87415	87463	87470	87470	he	299	youâ€”â€ My mouth formed a half - smirk . â€œSo let me take care of the trash.â€ I pointed my gun at Camo while holding the second weapon in my other hand . Rhys pulled back , keeping his gun aimed at Camo but his gaze on me .
87511	87575	87576	87576	I	0	kneecapsâ€”not to kill , merely to hobble him while I went to work . I ignored his pained screams as I locked the door . â€œYou made a mistake today , â€ I said conversationally , kneeling next to him . Images of Avaâ€ ™ s bruises and terrified face flashed through my mind , and my expression hardened . â€œYou touched what was mineâ€”â€
87599	87676	87680	87680	they	2054	mineâ€”â€ The smell of urine filled the air as he pissed himself . For such a tough - looking dude , he scared easily . My lips curled in distaste . â€œAnd now , itâ€ ™ s time to pay . Donâ€ ™ t worry.â€ I pulled his shirt up and dug the tip of the blade into his abdomen . â€œIâ€ ™ ll make it slow and sweet.â€ If Ava and Bridget had already called the policeâ€”which
87681	87726	87680	87680	they	2054	hadâ€”I only had precious minutes before they arrived . But with a few handy tools and creativity ? One could make a minute feel like an eternity . We didnâ€ ™ t pass the ten - second mark before Camoâ€ ™ s screams started again .
87785	87915	87772	87772	they	2055	outâ€”if I could bring myself to move . â€œAva?â€ Bridget placed a tentative hand on my arm . â€œThe police said we can go . Rhys will drive us back.â€ The massive bodyguard hovered so close he was practically on top of us , his usual stoic mask replaced with pure fury . I didnâ€ ™ t blame him . Weâ€ ™ d gotten ourselves into this mess . Bridget and I had wanted to see one of our favorite bands perform in D.C. last night . Cool indie bands didnâ€ ™ t visit the city often , and when they did , we took advantage . Exceptâ€ ¦ Rhys had flat - out forbidden Bridget from going because it wasnâ€ ™ t safe , and instead of arguing with himâ€”which
87922	88217	88232	88232	I	0	uselessâ€”Bridget snuck out in the middle of the night . Everything had gone according to plan until the camouflage - wearing psycho yanked us off the street after the concert and into the back of his van . Itâ€ ™ d happened so fast we didnâ€ ™ t have time to scream . Weâ€ ™ d fought back as hard as we could , and my amateur self - defense training allowed me to land a few hits , but heâ€ ™ d eventually knocked us out . When we woke up , we found ourselves in freakinâ€ ™ Philadelphia . A shudder rippled down my spine . Our kidnapper mustâ€ ™ ve been watching us for God knew how long before he made his move , which creeped me out more than the actual kidnapping part . â€œAre you ready?â€ Despite her calm tone , I detected a small shake in Bridgetâ€ ™ s shoulders , and I suspected that was the reason Rhys hadnâ€ ™ t torn us a new one yet . In fact , he hadnâ€ ™ t said a word to us except to explain heâ€ ™ d found us via the chip heâ€ ™ d placed in Bridgetâ€ ™ s phone , which heâ€ ™ d activated when he discovered she wasnâ€ ™ t in her room that morning . It was a testament to how much weâ€ ™ d fucked up that Bridget didnâ€ ™ t utter a peep about him secretly tracking her . My eyes strayed toward Alex , who looked remarkably composed for someone whoâ€ ™ d shot his uncle , killed our kidnapper , and almost died himself . He spoke with a police officer , his face not betraying a hint of agitation .
88283	88312	88273	88273	Iâ€	106	ideaâ€”â€ I ignored her . I stood , stepped around Bridget , and walked toward Alex , keeping the blanket the EMT gave me wrapped tight around my shoulders .
88444	88607	88441	88441	Bridget	105	leftâ€”how Alexâ€ ™ s uncle had ended up with six bullets in him or how the kidnapper had , according to the queasy - looking officer , ended up more carved up than a jack - o'-lantern on steroids . I technically didnâ€ ™ t know , but it didnâ€ ™ t take a genius to figure out what happened . I wasnâ€ ™ t sure what Alex told the police but considering they hadnâ€ ™ t arrested him for killing two people yet , I assumed heâ€ ™ d spun a convincing tale of self - defense . He was , after all , the consummate liar . Right ? Or had he been lying about lying ? There was only one way to find out . Alex noticed me first . He said something to the officer , who nodded and left . I stopped two feet from him , my hands strangling the blanket . He looked like old Alex againâ€”unruffled
89314	89318	89286	89286	Alex	98	hoursâ€”the past few monthsâ€ ”
89350	89361	89388	89388	she	125	meâ€”the hurt , the anger , the heartbreak and betrayal and sadnessâ€”until
89576	89597	89599	89599	Alex	98	beâ€”the one whoâ€ ™ d believed in light and love and the goodness of the world . That girl was gone .
89823	89924	89822	89822	my	0	penanceâ€”to burn in the flames of my self - inflicted agony for the rest of eternity . My personal living hell . My own walking damnation . â€œAlex.â€ The head of my Philly team approached me , his movements sharp and precise . He wore a Philadelphia police uniform , the badge gleaming in the afternoon soon , but he was no officer of the law . â€œThe house is ready.â€ â€œGood.â€ I noticed Rocco staring at me with a strange expression . â€œWhat?â€ I snapped . â€œNothing.â€ He cleared his throat . â€œYou just look like youâ€ ™ re about toâ€”never
89998	90190	90194	90194	he	2090	jobsâ€”not fixers who could bury any body , erase any evidence , and jam any communicationsâ€ ¦ including outgoing calls to local police stations . Every â€œpolice officerâ€ and â€œparamedicâ€ whoâ€ ™ d showed up today was on my team , and theyâ€ ™ d played their roles convincingly . Rocco looked like he wished heâ€ ™ d never opened his mouth . â€œLike youâ€ ™ re about to , ah , cry.â€ He flinched , no doubt aware that even though heâ€ ™ d intercepted Avaâ€ ™ s 911 call and pulled the team together in record time , that wouldnâ€ ™ t shield him from my wrath . The fire in my veins matched the burning behind my eyes . I didnâ€ ™ t dignify Roccoâ€ ™ s statement with a response ; I merely glared at him until he wilted . â€œAre there any other foolish observations youâ€ ™ d like to share with me?â€ My voice couldâ€ ™ ve frozen the Sahara . He gulped . â€œNo , sir.â€ â€œGood . Iâ€ ™ ll take care of the house.â€ There was a short pause . â€œPersonally ? Are youâ€”â€
91196	91207	91193	91193	they	2122	weaknessâ€”because she was my weakness , the only one I ever hadâ€”they
91266	91398	91263	91263	she	99	didâ€”it lay in pieces at her feet . â€œFight back , â€ Josh growled . â€œFight back so I can kill you , you bastard.â€ â€œNo . And not because Iâ€ ™ m afraid to die.â€ Hell , Iâ€ ™ d welcome it . I flashed a grim smile . The movement sent another burst of pain through my skull . â€œThis is your freebie . One session of unlimited beating for eight years of lies.â€ His mouth twisted , and he shoved me away with disgust . â€œIf you think one beatdown will make up for what youâ€ ™ ve done , youâ€ ™ re delusional . You wanted to use me ? Fine . But you brought my sister into this , and for that , I will never forgive you.â€
91659	91732	91650	91650	I	0	longerâ€”it was too full of memories , of faded laughs and conversations that stretched deep into the night . Not just with Ava , but with Josh . Weâ€ ™ d lived here together in college , and it had been some of the best years of my life . I closed my eyes , and for once , I allowed myself to sink into a good memory instead of a painful one .
91995	92003	91991	91991	I	0	badâ€”I was Alex Volkov ; I could do anythingâ€”but
92060	92065	92074	92074	her	99	noneâ€”unless I was with Ava .
92244	92393	92235	92235	Iâ€	106	memoriesâ€”every time I returned to reality , it was like losing Ava all over again . I was a fucked - up Prometheus , suffering for eternity , except instead of having my liver eaten by an asshole eagle every day , it was my heart breaking over and over . I lay there until the shadows lengthened and my back ached from the hardwood floor . Only then did I force myself to stand and limp to my car . The house next door was dark and silent , matching the weather . Iâ€ ™ d been so caught up in my misery I hadnâ€ ™ t realized it was storming . Rain fell in furious sheets , and angry bolts of lightning split the sky in half , illuminating the barren winter trees and cracked pavement . Not a hint of sunshine or life to be found .
92427	92445	92446	92446	she	105	rulesâ€”even if telling the truth meant getting himself in trouble , since Bridget had been kidnapped on his watchâ€”but
92583	93628	92577	92577	their	394	glancesâ€”they were worried . Really worried . So was Josh , who quit his volunteer program and moved back to Hazelburg for â€œmoral support.â€ Heâ€ ™ d landed a few days after the Philly incident for his belated holiday break , and when he found out what happened , he went berserk . Thatâ€ ™ d been almost two months ago . I was grateful for my friendsâ€ ™ support , but I needed more time . Space . They meant well , but I couldnâ€ ™ t breathe with them hovering all the time . â€œI donâ€ ™ t want it.â€ I pushed the cupcake away from me . Red velvet . Like the cookies Iâ€ ™ d baked for Alex as a welcome - to - the - neighborhood gift a lifetime ago . I couldnâ€ ™ t stand anything red velvet these days . â€œYou havenâ€ ™ t eaten yet , and itâ€ ™ s already late afternoon.â€ For once , Stella wasnâ€ ™ t glued to her phone . Instead , she stared at me with concern scrawled all over her face . â€œIâ€ ™ m not hungry.â€ Jules , Bridget , and Stella exchanged glances . Iâ€ ™ d moved in with Bridget because I couldnâ€ ™ t stand living near Alex anymore . Even though heâ€ ™ d moved out soon after I did , I couldnâ€ ™ t look at that house without thinking of him , and every time I thought of him , I felt like I was drowning . Helpless . Unmoored . Unable to breathe . â€œYour birthdayâ€ ™ s coming up . We should celebrate.â€ Bridget switched topics . â€œHow about a spa day ? You love massages , and itâ€ ™ ll be on me.â€ I shook my head . â€œOr maybe something simple like a movie night?â€ Stella suggested . â€œPJs , junk food , junk movies.â€ â€œMovies so bad theyâ€ ™ re almost good , â€ Jules added . â€œOkay.â€ I didnâ€ ™ t feel like celebrating , but I also didnâ€ ™ t feel like arguing , and they would bug me until I agreed to something . â€œIâ€ ™ m going to take a nap.â€ I didnâ€ ™ t wait for them to answer before I pushed my chair back and went upstairs to my room . I locked the door and climbed into bed , but I couldnâ€ ™ t sleep . Iâ€ ™ d stopped having so many nightmares after I regained my memories , but it was now my waking hours that I dreaded . I lay in the dark , listening to the rain outside and watching the shadows dance across my ceiling . The past two months had both flown by and dragged on , with each day bleeding into the next in an endless sludge of numbness . Yet I woke up every morning , surprised Iâ€ ™ d survived another day . Between Michaelâ€ ™ s and Alexâ€ ™ s betrayals , I had depleted my capacity to cry . I hadnâ€ ™ t shed a single tear since I returned from Philadelphia . My phone pinged with a new email notification on the nightstand . I ignored it . It was probably a stupid ten percent off coupon for something I didnâ€ ™ t need . Then again , it wasnâ€ ™ t like I could sleep , and the sound lingered in the silence . I sighed and grabbed my cell , opening the new email with all the enthusiasm of a prisoner on their way to Death Row . It was the orientation package for the WYP fellowship , complete with a calendar of classes and activities for the year , a list of housing suggestions , and a mini travel guide to New York City . I was graduating and moving to Manhattan in May . Itâ€ ™ d been my dream since I was thirteen , but I couldnâ€ ™ t summon a flicker of excitement at the prospect . New York was too close to D.C. for comfort , and to be honest , I hadnâ€ ™ t picked up my camera in weeks . I even canceled my engagement shoot with Elliott and his fiancÃ © e because I didnâ€ ™ t think I could do them justice . Heâ€ ™ d been disappointed , but Iâ€ ™ d steered them toward another photographer who could help . My clients deserved better than what I could give them because at this point , I had zero inspiration or motivation to shoot . I was entering the worldâ€ ™ s most prestigious fellowship in two - and - a - half months , and my creative well was drier than the Kalahari Desert . One more beautiful thing in my life , ruined . Out of nowhere , fury blasted through me , shocking me out of my stupor . This shouldâ€ ™ ve been the best , most exciting time of my life . It was my senior year , and my dream program had accepted me . Instead of celebrating , I was moping like aâ€ ¦ well , a heartbroken teenager . And even though that was half correct , I was sick of it . Sick of letting men who didnâ€ ™ t give two shits about me have this hold over me . Sick of being the object of pitying looks and worried whispers . Maybe I was that person in the past , but not anymore . Anger and indignation rushed through my veins , compelling me to get out of bed and rifle through my drawers until I found what I was looking for . I put it on , covered it up with a hoodie and jeans , and shoved my feet into boots . I walked down the stairs and found my friends huddled in the living room . Rhys stood in the corner , stone - faced and watchful . â€œDo you want a ride somewhere?â€ Bridget asked when she saw my outfit . â€œItâ€ ™ s pouring outside.â€ â€œNo , I have an umbrella.â€ â€œWhere are you going?â€ Stella asked . â€œIâ€ ™ ll goâ€”â€
93640	93653	93657	93657	I	0	doâ€”alone.â€ A small frown took over her face . â€œI donâ€ ™ t thinkâ€”â€
94071	94158	94179	94180	no one	549	Alâ€”after all my swim lessons . Still , my skin prickled with unease at the undulations in the pale turquoise water , which seemed to stretch forever in its Olympic - sized concrete container . I hadnâ€ ™ t had a swim lesson in months . I thought I remembered the basics , but what if I didnâ€ ™ t ? My chest tightened , and it took more effort than it shouldâ€ ™ ve to draw enough oxygen into my lungs . It was worse when Alâ€”when
94452	94459	94431	94431	Josh	106	Alexâ€”there , I said his full name â€”picking
94470	94517	94463	94463	Alex	98	” My head broke above the water , and I gasped for air . I allowed myself a minute break before I dove again . Alexâ€ ™ s birthday . Our first kiss . Our weekend at the hotel . Thanksgiving . My father . My kidnapping .

95099	95329	95332	95332	his	2178	youâ€”â€ â€œYou can leave.â€ She fled without a second thought . I didnâ€ ™ t blame her . Iâ€ ™ d been in a foul mood for months , and sheâ€ ™ d learned it was best to stay out of sight . Ralph arched his eyebrows . â€œSomeoneâ€ ™ s in a bad mood.â€ â€œDonâ€ ™ t you have a business to run?â€ I clicked out of the spreadsheet Iâ€ ™ d been examining and leaned back , irritation coiling in my stomach . I didnâ€ ™ t have time for bullshit today . I barely had time for lunch . Ever since I took over as CEO of Archer Group , the companyâ€ ™ s stocks had shot sky - high . Likely because I worked nonstop , more than I ever had . I barely left my office . Work kept me busy , and busy was good . â€œAh , about that.â€ He rubbed the back of his neck . â€œI wanted to tell you in person.â€ â€œWhatever it is , make it quick . I have a phone call with the Vice - President in an hour.â€ I picked up my glass of whisky and drained the rest of the Macallan . Yes , it was only noon . No , I didnâ€ ™ t give a fuck . â€œThe Vice - President of the Unitedâ€”â€
95823	95823	95783	95783	Donâ€	183	Avaâ€”â€
95957	95998	96002	96002	her	2195	didâ€”â€ â€œWeâ€ ™ re . Not . Discussing . It.â€ A vein throbbed in my temple . This was why I abhorred human companionship . People couldnâ€ ™ t shut the hell up . â€œNow , if youâ€ ™ ll excuse meâ€”â€
96044	96082	96002	96002	her	2195	sâ€”â€ â€œDonâ€ ™ t bother , Iâ€ ™ ll announce myself.â€ A statuesque blonde swept in like she owned the place . The vein in my temple pulsed harder . â€œPrincess Bridget of Eldorra , here to see Assholeâ€”I
96202	96349	96193	96193	she	265	princessâ€”â€ â€œLeave . Iâ€ ™ ll take care of it.â€ My call with the VP was in forty minutes , and Iâ€ ™ d already wasted enough time . â€œThatâ€ ™ s my cue.â€ Ralph rose . â€œIâ€ ™ ll take you up on the meal , but it looks like you have some stuff to hash out first.â€ He tilted his head toward Bridget but kept his eyes on me . â€œThink about what I said.â€ â€œSure.â€ I would rather eat rusted nails than visit Vermont . I didnâ€ ™ t do country life . When the door closed behind Ralph and Carolina , I leaned back in my chair and laced my fingers over my chest . â€œTo what do I owe the pleasure , Your Highness?â€ I kept my expression impassive and tried not to think of the last time Iâ€ ™ d seen Bridgetâ€”in
96932	97086	97096	97096	Bridgetâ€	125	Iâ€”â€ â€œStill care about her , â€ Bridget repeated . â€œTake a pill for the delusion , princess . I used her . I got what I wanted . Now Iâ€ ™ m done . Iâ€ ™ ve been done for months.â€ I shrugged on my jacket . â€œNow fuck off.â€ â€œFor someone whoâ€ ™ s usually so composed , youâ€ ™ re awfully agitated , â€ she said . â€œI wonder why.â€ â€œHow about you mind your business , I mind mine.â€ I flicked my eyes toward Rhys , who glared back at me with dangerous gray eyes . Bridget tensed . â€œWhatâ€ ™ s that supposed to mean?â€ â€œYou know what it means.â€ â€œFine . Stay in denial.â€ Bridget stood , her complexion a shade paler than before . â€œI guess you donâ€ ™ t want to know about Ava.â€ â€œWhat about Ava?â€ The question slipped out before I could stop it .
97297	97638	97271	97271	her	105	doâ€”donâ€ ™ t insult me by denying it again , â€ she said when I opened my mouth . â€œI may not have a MENSA - level IQ , but Iâ€ ™ m not an idiot . I hate to admit it , but youâ€ ™ re the only person with any hope of getting through to her . Iâ€ ™ ve tried , Jules and Stella have tried , Josh has tried hard as he canâ€ ¦ but itâ€ ™ s not working.â€ I suppressed a flinch at the mention of Joshâ€ ™ s name . â€œAvaâ€ ™ s fine . Sheâ€ ™ s healthy and thriving in school . Sheâ€ ™ s even swimming on her own now.â€ There was no use pretending anymore . Bridget saw right through my bullshit . â€œOn the outside , Ava is fine , â€ she said . â€œNot on the inside . Sheâ€ ™ sâ€ ¦ I donâ€ ™ t know how to explain it . Itâ€ ™ s like sheâ€ ™ s missing the spark that makes her her . â€ I knew exactly what she meant , because Iâ€ ™ d seen that spark die in front of my eyes . I exhaled a ragged breath and tried to gather my swirling thoughts . They were usually crystal clear , each arranging themselves in the perfect pattern for me to analyze and strategize , but Iâ€ ™ d barely slept over the past few months , and I hadnâ€ ™ t eaten in almost twenty - four hours . I was a mess . Iâ€ ™ d been a mess since I let Ava go . â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if sheâ€ ™ ll forgive you for what you did , â€ Bridget said . â€œOr if I want her to forgive you . But itâ€ ™ s not about me . Itâ€ ™ s about her . Imagine how she must feel , finding out both her â€˜fatherâ€ ™ and her â€˜boyfriendâ€ ™ lied to her for so longâ€”and
97803	97977	97799	97799	her	99	feelâ€”â€ â€œBecause sheâ€ ™ s better off without me , okay?â€ I exploded , months of pent - up emotion bursting forth in one giant , scalding wave . Rhys stepped forward , but Bridget waved him back , those blue eyes trained on me with fascination . I didnâ€ ™ t blame her . Iâ€ ™ d never blown up like that in front of another person . Ever . It was strangely cathartic . â€œI couldnâ€ ™ t protect her . She was hurt because of me . My uncle kidnapped her because of me . And I couldnâ€ ™ t stop him.â€ I pressed my lips together , trying to calm my rampaging pulse . Five months later , I still woke in the middle of the night , terrified something had happened to Ava . Envisioning all the things that couldâ€ ™ ve happened to her had things gone sideways in my uncleâ€ ™ s office . That was why Iâ€ ™ d hired the private investigator - slash - bodyguardâ€”I

99490	99625	99648	99648	her	2293	meâ€”she went to New York while I came here . It was the only way the program would let me change my location so late in the process , but it worked out . â€œYou sure you canâ€ ™ t join us?â€ Jack , an Australian wildlife photographer who was also in this yearâ€ ™ s fellowship cohort , asked . â€œHalf - off drinks at The Black Boar today.â€ The Black Boar , located a few minutesâ€ ™ walk away from the WYP building , was one of the fellowsâ€ ™ favorite pubs . I shook my head with a regretful smile . â€œNext time . Iâ€ ™ m behind on editing photos.â€ I wanted to make sure the final products were top - notch because they werenâ€ ™ t for any olâ€ ™ workshopâ€”they
99781	99825	99854	99856	Higherâ€ ¦ higherâ€	326	bagâ€”it was impossible to find anything smaller than a full - sized laptop . My fingers closed around the thin white wires right when I felt a prickle of heat on my neck . An electric awareness I hadnâ€ ™ t felt in months .
100660	100691	100655	100655	someone	2621	youâ€”â€ â€œWait.â€ I held up one hand . â€œYou had me followed ? â€ â€œFor your protection.â€ I couldnâ€ ™ t believe it . â€œHow is that okay ? Thatâ€ ™ sâ€”thatâ€

Iâ€ ™ d been doing so well , but every second in Alexâ€ ™ s presence eroded the defenses Iâ€ ™ d built around my heart until it lay naked and vulnerable once more . â€œYouâ€ ™ ve ruined everything I once thought was beautiful . Sunshine . Love . Even freakinâ€ ™ red velvet cake , because it reminds me of you . And when I think of youâ€”â€
101337	101825	101318	101318	Itâ€	126	â€œSunâ€”Ava , no.â€ Alex reached for me , but I instinctively recoiled . Hurt filled his face . His hand curled into a fist that he stuffed back in his pocket , and the tendons in his neck stretched taut . I detected a tiny tremble in his shoulders as he spoke . â€œThat was what I believed because Iâ€ ™ d never known anything else , but you showed me there is beauty in the world . I see it every time I look at you , or see you smile , or hear you laugh . You believe the best of people and thatâ€ ™ s a strength , not a weakness . Donâ€ ™ t let anyone , least of all me , take that away from you.â€ His eyes burned into mine , bright with pain . â€œYou told me once there was something beautiful waiting for me , something thatâ€ ™ ll restore my faith in life . Iâ€ ™ ve found it . Itâ€ ™ s you.â€ I wanted to sink into his words until they became my reality , but Iâ€ ™ d been burned before . Who knew what he wanted from me this time around ? â€œYou keep talking about protecting me , â€ I said . â€œBut you hurt me more than anyone else in my life , even Michael . Even when I thought you were an ass , I trusted you to tell the truth , and you turned out to be the biggest liar of all . Justâ€ ¦ â€ I sucked in a deep breath , unable to look at him , it hurt so much . â€œLeave me alone.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s chest heaved like he couldnâ€ ™ t get enough air into his lungs . â€œI canâ€ ™ t do that , sweetheart . Iâ€ ™ ll wait however long it takes , but Iâ€ ™ ll never be okay with a world in which youâ€ ™ re alone.â€ â€œWho says I will be ? Maybe Iâ€ ™ ll find someone else.â€ His eyes darkened into a furious shade of emerald , and his shoulders tensed even more . Somewhere , thunder boomed . I hadnâ€ ™ t noticed the weather morph from sunny to its current gray , gloomy state , but I wouldnâ€ ™ t be surprised if Alex had the power to control it with his emotions . â€œThe hell you will , â€ he snarled . â€œIâ€ ™ ll kill any man that touches you.â€ â€œYou have no right , â€ I hissed back . â€œI donâ€ ™ t belong to you.â€ The muscles in his jaw popped . â€œThatâ€ ™ s where youâ€ ™ re wrong . I fucked up . Massively . But I will earn your forgiveness one day , and you are mine . Always . No matter how much time or distance separate us.â€
102238	102274	102280	102280	Donâ€	183	faceâ€”from the rain or my tears , I couldnâ€ ™ t tell . Alex didnâ€ ™ t follow me inside the building , but I could feel the heat of his gaze as I slipped inside .
102706	102815	102686	102686	He	98	sconeâ€”my favorites . He was there to walk me home after my workshops . Other times , especially when I was with other people or exploring the city on the weekends , he was less conspicuous , but he was there . I felt his presence even though I couldnâ€ ™ t see him . I never thought Alex Volkov would become my stalker , but there we were . On top of that , gifts arrived every day . By the boatload . By the end of the first week , my apartment looked like I was opening an indoor garden . I donated everything to a local hospitalâ€”the
102857	102976	103020	103020	I	0	envyâ€”at least , until I pawned them . The sum I received for the pile of diamond earrings , sapphire bracelets and ruby necklaces made my eyes water , but I donated most of it to various charities and saved the rest for living expenses . London wasnâ€ ™ t cheap , and the fellowship stipend wasnâ€ ™ t exactly princely . By the end of the third week , I was knee - deep in gourmet chocolates , gift baskets , and custom - made desserts . I didnâ€ ™ t care about fancy jewels or flowers , so those gifts didnâ€ ™ t matter to me . It was the little things that tore holes in my heartâ€”the
103528	104254	103500	103500	Alexâ€	328	butâ€”â€ â€œNo.â€ My heart broke into a gallop . I knew what he would say next , and I was nowhere near ready to hear it . â€œDonâ€ ™ t.â€ â€œAva , I love you.â€ His eyes flickered with emotion , and my chest squeezed until I thought it would burst . â€œWhen you told me you loved me , I didnâ€ ™ t say it back because I didnâ€ ™ t feel like I deserved your love . You didnâ€ ™ t know the truth about my plan yet , and I didnâ€ ™ t thinkâ€ ¦ fuck.â€ He rubbed the back of his neck , looking uncharacteristically flustered . â€œThis wasnâ€ ™ t how Iâ€ ™ d planned to say it , â€ he muttered . â€œBut itâ€ ™ s true . And maybe I still donâ€ ™ t deserve you , but Iâ€ ™ m willing to work at it until I do.â€ â€œYou donâ€ ™ t love me.â€ I shook my head , my eyes and nose burning with unshed tears . Iâ€ ™ d cried so much lately I annoyed myself , but I couldnâ€ ™ t stop . â€œYou donâ€ ™ t even know what love is . You lied and used me and Josh for eight years . Eight years . Thatâ€ ™ s not love . Thatâ€ ™ s manipulation . Insanity.â€ â€œIt started out that way , but Josh really did become my best friend , and I really did fall for you.â€ Alex let out a short laugh . â€œYou think I wanted those things to happen ? I didnâ€ ™ t. They completely screwed my plans over . I held off on bringing down Michael for years because of you and Josh.â€ â€œHow generous of you , â€ I said sarcastically . His jaw tightened . â€œI never claimed to be Prince Charming , and my love isnâ€ ™ t a fairy tale type of love . Iâ€ ™ m a fucked - up person with fucked - up morals . I wonâ€ ™ t write you poems or serenade you beneath the moonlight . But you are the only woman I have eyes for . Your enemies are my enemies , your friends are my friends , and if you wanted , I would burn down the world for you.â€ My heart split in half . I wanted so badly to believe him , butâ€ ¦ â€œEven if thatâ€ ™ s true , itâ€ ™ s not about love . Itâ€ ™ s about trust , and I donâ€ ™ t trust you anymore . You proved youâ€ ™ re the master of the long game . What if this is just another one of those ? What if one day , ten years from now , I wake up and you break my heart again ? I wonâ€ ™ t survive it a second time.â€ If the source of the heartbreak were anyone else , maybe . But not Alex . He was embedded not only in my heart but in my soul , and if I lost him again for whatever reason , it was game over . â€œAva.â€ Alexâ€ ™ s voice cracked . Red rimmed his eyes , and I couldâ€ ™ ve sworn he was on the verge of crying . But this was Alex . He didnâ€ ™ t cry . He wasnâ€ ™ t capable of it . â€œSweetheart , please . Tell me what I have to do . Iâ€ ™ ll do anything.â€ â€œI donâ€ ™ t know if thereâ€ ™ s anything you can do , â€ I whispered . â€œIâ€ ™ m sorry.â€ â€œThen Iâ€ ™ ll just have to try everything until we find something , â€ he said , his face granite , his tone resolute . Alex wouldnâ€ ™ t give up until he got what he wanted . It wasnâ€ ™ t in his nature . But if I gave in to him the way my heart wanted but my mind screamed at me not to , how could I live with myself ? A relationship without trust was built on a foundation of sand , and after a lifetime of drifting , I needed solid ground . â€œGo home to D.C. , Alex , â€ I said , exhaustedâ€”mentally
104315	104559	104297	104297	I	0	” â€œI resigned as CEO , effective one month ago.â€ That shocked me out of my reverie . â€œWhat ? â€ He was the most ambitious person I knew , and heâ€ ™ d been CEO for less than a year . Why hadnâ€ ™ t I heard about this ? Then again , I didnâ€ ™ t follow financial news , and Iâ€ ™ d avoided any news about Alex himself . Alex shrugged . â€œI couldnâ€ ™ t stay on as CEO while spending all my time in London with you , so I resigned , â€ he said matter - of - factly , like he hadnâ€ ™ t given up his lifeâ€ ™ s work on a whim . Except Alex did nothing on a whim . He thought through every move , and his latest one made no sense . Not unlessâ€ ¦ I squashed the brief flare of hope before it could blossom into something greater . â€œBut what about money and expenses?â€ I realized how dumb that question was the second I asked it . Alexâ€ ™ s mouth tilted up . â€œI have enough in stocks , investments , and savings to last me the rest of my life . I worked because I wanted to . But now , I want to do something else.â€ I swallowed , my pulse thundering . â€œWhatâ€ ™ s that?â€ â€œWin you back . No matter how long it takes.â€
105302	105530	105645	105645	her	2393	thumpedâ€”in warning or excitement , I wasnâ€ ™ t sure . I glanced frantically around the gallery , searching for thick brown hair and cool green eyes . Nothing . But he was here . He was my anonymous buyer . I felt it in my gut . Alex and I had developed a newâ€ ¦ well , I wasnâ€ ™ t sure if I could call it a friendship , but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago . He still waited for me in front of my flat every morning and walked me home after my workshops every afternoon . Sometimes we talked , sometimes we didnâ€ ™ t. He helped me practice my self - defense moves , assembled my new dining table after my old one broke , and served as a de facto assistant on some of my photoshoots . It had taken a long time before we reached that point , but weâ€ ™ d gotten there . He was trying . More than trying . And while Iâ€ ™ d regained a modicum of trust in him , something held me back from fully forgiving him . I could see how much it hurt him every time I pushed him away , but the wounds from his and Michaelâ€ ™ s betrayalsâ€”while
105533	105633	105645	105645	her	2393	healingâ€”ran deep , and I was still learning to trust myself , much less other people . Josh , whoâ€ ™ d graduated med school last month , had visited a few times , and I made Alex stay out of sight while he was in town . Josh was still furious with Alex , and I didnâ€ ™ t need them getting into a fistfight in the middle of London . Jules , Bridget , and Stella had visited too . I hadnâ€ ™ t told them about Alex , but I had a hunch Bridget knew something was upâ€”sheâ€
105759	105762	105805	105805	his	98	somethingâ€”wait , what ?
105873	106052	106060	106060	She	2401	artsâ€”or my singing skills.â€ Soft laughter rippled through the crowd , along with a few knowing looks . Alex waited for the chuckles to die down before he continued , his gaze burning into mine . â€œWhether itâ€ ™ s music , photography , film , or painting , the arts reflect the world around us , and for too long , I only saw the dark side . The seedy underbellies , the ugly truths . Photographs reminded me of moments in time that never lasted . Songs reminded me that words have the power to rip oneâ€ ™ s heart out . Why , then , would I care about art when it was so terrible and destructive?â€ It was a bold statement to make in front of Londonâ€ ™ s art world , but no one heckled . No one so much as breathed . Alex had us all under the spell of his words . â€œThen someone came into my life and upended everything I thought I knew . She was everything I wasnâ€ ™ tâ€”pure
106218	106476	106211	106211	It	2405	eitherâ€”everyone stared at Alex with rapt fascination , and I was pretty sure a few of the women straight - up swooned . I pressed my fist to my mouth as the lyrics flowed over me . It was a song about love and heartbreak . Betrayal and redemption . Regret and forgiveness . Each word tore me apart , as did the fact that Alex sang at all . No matter how much Iâ€ ™ d cajoled or begged in the past , it was the one thing heâ€ ™ d refused to do . Until now . I understood why heâ€ ™ d refused . Alex didnâ€ ™ t just sing , he sang . With emotion , with beauty , with so much rawness it took my breath away . He bared his soul with each note , and for a man who thought his soul was irrevocably damned , the thought of doing that in front of an audience mustâ€ ™ ve been unbearable . Alex finished to thunderous applause . His gaze lingered on mine for one long moment before he disappeared offstage , and the crowd broke up into excited chatter and gasps . My feet moved before I could think , but I only made it two steps before Diane stopped me . â€œAva , before you leave , thereâ€ ™ s someone I want you to meet , â€ she said . â€œThe editor of World Geographic is here , and theyâ€ ™ re always looking for talented young photographers.â€ â€œIâ€”okay.â€
106759	107087	107095	107095	Ava.â€	214	talentedâ€”young still , and your work could use a little more refinement , but you have extraordinary potential.â€ â€œThank you , sir.â€ Between Alexâ€ ™ s performance and praise from Laurent freakinâ€ ™ Boucher , this whole evening was surreal . â€œPlease , call me Laurent.â€ We chatted for another fifteen minutes , during which Diane excused herself to speak with the fellowship director . At the end of our conversation , Laurent handed me his card and told me to be in touch if I was interested in freelancing for a junior role at World Geographic . Um , yes . I was over the moon about the opportunity , but I couldnâ€ ™ t help breathing a sigh of relief when Laurent got distracted by another acquaintance . I thanked him and left to search for Alex , but I was interrupted again by a group of fellows who heard Iâ€ ™ d already sold my entire collection and wanted to know who the buyer was . I told them I didnâ€ ™ t know , which was technically true . That kept happening the entire evening . Iâ€ ™ d end one conversation only to get drawn into another . I was grateful for all the people who wanted to connect and congratulate me , but dammit , Alex was the only person I wanted to talk to . By the end of the night , I hadnâ€ ™ t caught a single glimpse of him since his performance . My feet hurt , my cheeks ached from constant smiling , and my stomach growled from the lack of food . I was always too nervous to eat at events . Guests trickled out until I was one of only a handful of people left in the gallery , including the cleanup crew . I couldnâ€ ™ t believe Alex would leave without a word after what he did , but there was no denying itâ€”he
107435	107500	107407	107407	his	168	guyâ€”â€ â€œOuch.â€ Jack winced . â€œI feel like thatâ€ ™ s not a good thing when used in this context.â€ I laughed . â€œNo , trust me , itâ€ ™ s a good thing . Youâ€ ™ re cute and funny and talented too , and any girl would be lucky to date you.â€ â€œI sense a but coming , â€ he said wryly . â€œButâ€”â€
107710	107782	107693	107693	his	168	securityâ€”â€ â€œNo , itâ€ ™ s fine . I know him , â€ I blurted before Jack could get himself into more trouble . â€œHeâ€ ™ s , uh , prone to hyperbole.â€ I took a step back , forcing Jack to release me . â€œI need to talk to him , but Iâ€ ™ ll see you later , okay?â€ He shot me a disbelieving look . â€œAva , heâ€ ™ sâ€”â€
108049	108848	108032	108032	He	233	â€œIâ€”â€ He paused , his jaw working before he said carefully , â€œIâ€ ™ m not the best at expressing my emotions . Thatâ€ ™ s why Iâ€ ™ ve never liked singing . Itâ€ ™ s all emotion , and it feels too vulnerable . I canâ€ ™ t stand it . But I said Iâ€ ™ m willing to do whatever it takes to win you back , and I meant it , just as I meant every word in that song . That song was for you . But Iâ€ ™ m running out of ideas , sweetheart.â€ Alex rubbed his thumb over the curve of my jaw and gave me a sad smile . â€œDo you know this is the first time youâ€ ™ ve let me touch you in over a year?â€ I opened my mouth to argue because that couldnâ€ ™ t possibly be trueâ€ ¦ except it was . A montage of images flashed through my mind of me shrinking back or turning away every time Alex reached for me over the past twelve months . Not because I didnâ€ ™ t want him to touch me , but because I didnâ€ ™ t trust myself not to cave if he got that close again . He never said anything , but Iâ€ ™ d caught the hurt and pain in his eyes . â€œI looked for you after , â€ I said , my chin wobbling . â€œI couldnâ€ ™ t find you . You disappeared.â€ â€œItâ€ ™ s your big night . I didnâ€ ™ t want to take that away from you.â€ â€œI thought you left.â€ I didnâ€ ™ t know why , but I started crying . The tears dripped down my cheeks , and my sniffles echoed in the empty gallery . I was mortified , but at least we were the only people there . There had to be staff somewhere in the building or they wouldâ€ ™ ve kicked us out , but I couldnâ€ ™ t see them . â€œI would never leave you.â€ Alex drew me into his chest , and I sank into his embrace for the first time in what felt like forever . It was like returning home after a long , lonely trip abroad . Iâ€ ™ d forgotten how safe I felt in his arms , like nothing and no one could hurt me . That I felt this way even after what he did spoke volumes . â€œDo you want me to leave?â€ he asked gruffly . I buried my face in his chest and shook my head . He smelled like warmth and spice , and it was so familiar it made my heart hurt . I missed it . I missed him . Even though Iâ€ ™ d seen Alex every day for the past year , it wasnâ€ ™ t the same as touching him and actually being with him . â€œDo you miss me , sweetheart?â€ His voice gentled . I nodded , my face still buried in his chest . All this time , Iâ€ ™ d been afraid to let him back in , partly because I didnâ€ ™ t trust him , but mostly because I didnâ€ ™ t trust myself . After being lied to for so long by two people Iâ€ ™ d loved , Iâ€ ™ d begun to think of my heart as my enemy and not my friend . How could I trust my instincts when theyâ€ ™ d led me so astray in the past ? But the more I thought about it , the more I realized I hadnâ€ ™ t been wrong . Iâ€ ™ d thought Michael was my real father and that heâ€ ™ d saved my life , but Iâ€ ™ d always felt uncomfortable around him . I never bonded with him the way a daughter should with her father . I figured it was because heâ€ ™ d been uncomfortable around me , and while that may have played a part , it had mostly been a sixth sense that warned me not to get too close . As for Alex , heâ€ ™ d pulled the wool over both my and Joshâ€ ™ s eyes . But in my heart of hearts , I believed him when he said our relationship and his feelings were real . Was there a chance I was wrong , and this was yet another fucked - up long game ? Yes , though I didnâ€ ™ t see what else he could want from me . Heâ€ ™ d targeted Michael based on false information , and even if he hadnâ€ ™ t , Michael was already out of the pictureâ€”heâ€
109478	109864	109874	109874	you	2438	doâ€”â€ He grabbed my throat , his voice dropping to a soft snarl . My core spasmed in response . â€œTell me about the blond fucker who asked you out . Did you let him touch you , Sunshine ? Did you let him touch what was mine?â€ I shook my head , practically panting from arousal . Alexâ€ ™ s grip tightened . â€œAre you lying to save him?â€ â€œNo , â€ I moaned . â€œI swear . I donâ€ ™ t think of him that way.â€ I gasped when he spun me around and pressed my cheek against the wall . The icy concrete dug into my heated skin , and my nipples hardened into painful points . Alex yanked up my skirt and shoved aside my panties with his free hand . â€œYou donâ€ ™ t think about him ever , â€ he growled . I heard his belt unbuckling and his pants unzipping . â€œIâ€ ™ m the only man in your mind . In your mouth . In your tight little pussy . Do you understand?â€ â€œYes!â€ I was so delirious with lust I wouldâ€ ™ ve said yes to anything at this point . â€œTell me who you belong to.â€ He slid his cock against my drenched folds , and I almost had a mini - orgasm from that simple action alone . â€œI belong to you.â€ Alex hissed out a breath , and that was the only warning I received before he slammed into me . He clapped a hand over my mouth , muffling my screams , but I was so far gone I barely noticed . I could only focus on the sensation of his cock pounding into me and the pleasure crashing over me in waves . The framed photos from the exhibition banged against the wall with each thrust , and I dimly heard something crashing to the ground . I was about to come when Alex spun me around again so we faced each other . His skin was flushed with exertion , his eyes dark with lust . He was the most beautiful thing Iâ€ ™ d ever seen . He crushed his lips to mine , hard and demanding . I yielded with no resistance , letting him into every part of meâ€”my
110206	110219	110245	110245	She	137	minuteâ€”except when he leaves his dirty clothes everywhere and refuses to see the doctorâ€”but
110336	110358	110324	110324	she	137	jokesâ€”and raunchy personal stories . This morning , out of the blue , she asked whether Iâ€ ™ d ever had a threesomeâ€”I
110361	110692	110324	110324	she	137	tâ€”and Iâ€ ™ d nearly sprayed orange juice all over her cherrywood table . â€œI didnâ€ ™ t mean to embarrass you.â€ Missy patted my arm , but the spark of mischief remained in her eyes . â€œIâ€ ™ m just so thrilled Alex is dating . Iâ€ ™ ve known that boy for years , and Iâ€ ™ ve never seen him look at someone the way he does you . Iâ€ ™ ve always said he just needs the right woman to open him up . He was wound tighter than a Victorian corset.â€ I leaned toward her and said in a conspiratorial whisper , â€œHonestly , not much has changed.â€ â€œYou know I can hear everything youâ€ ™ re saying , â€ Alex said dryly . â€œGood . I was afraid l wasnâ€ ™ t loud enough.â€ His eyes narrowed while Missy burst into laughter . Even Ralph chuckled as I flashed a cheeky smile . â€œSunshine , you being loud has never been an issue , â€ Alex said in silky voice . My mashed potatoes went down the wrong pipe , and I erupted into a fit of coughs . Missyâ€ ™ s laughter morphed into outright cackling . Poor Ralph turned bright red , muttered something about the restroom , and fled . Once I got my coughs under control , I glared at Alex , who remained unfazed . â€œIâ€ ™ m talking about the volume of your voice during conversations , of course.â€ He raised his wineglass to his lips . â€œWhat did you think I meant?â€ â€œI have a feeling you wonâ€ ™ t be hearing my voice during conversations for a while , â€ I huffed . â€œWeâ€ ™ ll see.â€ He sounded infuriatingly smug . â€œIâ€ ™ ll leave you two lovebirds alone while I fetch Ralph.â€ Missy chuckled . â€œPoor thing is a lion in the bedroom but a blushing kitten when it comes to talking about sex in publicâ€”directly
111060	111178	111759	111759	her	137	hotterâ€”I was so wet I was afraid Iâ€ ™ d leave a noticeable spot on Alexâ€ ™ s pants when I stood . â€œNo ? Ah , well.â€ Alex nipped my earlobe . â€œClose enough.â€ He cupped my chin with his other hand and turned my face so I looked back at him . â€œDid you enjoy this week?â€ â€œYeah . It was the best Thanksgiving Iâ€ ™ ve had in a while , â€ I said softly . I felt guilty because while all my Thanksgivings with Michael were tainted , Iâ€ ™ d spent the holiday with Josh last year . Heâ€ ™ d flown to London , and we had a blast stuffing ourselves with foodâ€”restaurant
111191	111745	111785	111785	she	137	turkeyâ€”while binge - watching British dramas . But Iâ€ ™ d been unsure about my feelings for Alex , and Josh had been pissed at his ex - best friend . He still was . When he found out Alex and I were back together , he lost his shit . He wouldnâ€ ™ t talk to me for weeks , and even now , our conversations were strained . Josh stayed in D.C. for his residency , so we still lived in the same city , but he refused to see me if Alex was there . Heâ€ ™ d ignored all of Alexâ€ ™ s outreach and seen through my schemes to help them patch things up . Iâ€ ™ d invited him to celebrate Thanksgiving with us , but as Iâ€ ™ d expected , heâ€ ™ d declined . â€œI do wish Josh couldâ€ ™ ve made it , â€ I admitted . I missed my brother . â€œMe too . But heâ€ ™ ll come around.â€ Despite his confident words , a small furrow creased Alexâ€ ™ s brow . He didnâ€ ™ t say it , but I knew he missed Josh too . Theyâ€ ™ d been as close as brothers . Unfortunately , Josh was stubborn as a bull . The more you pushed him , the more he dug his heels in . The only thing we could do was give him time and wait . â€œHe will.â€ I sighed and looped my arms around Alexâ€ ™ s neck . â€œOther than that , though , this week was perfect.â€ Weâ€ ™ d been in Vermont for six days , and the whole getaway had been a Pinterest - worthy autumn dream . Artisan fairs , a turkey trot , the best hot apple cider Iâ€ ™ ve ever tastedâ€ ¦ even Alex enjoyed being here , though he refused to admit it . Iâ€ ™ d overheard his conversation with Ralph when his old Krav Maga instructor called and invited him up here for Thanksgiving , and it took me forever to convince him to accept . â€œGood.â€ Alex dropped both his hands to my waist and kissed me on the lips . â€œBe glad I rented us our own cabin instead of staying here with Ralph and Missy , â€ he whispered . â€œBecause youâ€ ™ re going to pay for your sass earlier.â€ My heart skipped with excitement . Before I could respond , Missy and Ralphâ€ ™ s voices drifted through the doorway , and I jumped up so fast I banged my knee on the underside of the table . I lunged into my chair , my face beet - red , right as our hosts reentered the room . â€œSorry we took so long , â€ Missy chirped . â€œHope weâ€ ™ re not interrupting anything.â€ â€œNope , â€ I squeaked . â€œI was just enjoying your delicious chicken.â€ I munched on the now - cold meat . â€œYum.â€ Alex snorted out a laugh , which earned him another glare from me . â€œMost of the food is cold , dear.â€ Missy clucked in disappointment . â€œDo you want me to heat â€˜em up or skip straight to dessert ? I made pecan pie , pumpkin pie , apple pieâ€”â€
112141	112204	112103	112103	he	103	Coldâ€”except for the warmth of his embrace and the teasing glint in his eyes . I wrapped my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist . â€œSo weâ€ ™ re coming back for Thanksgiving next year , right?â€ Alex sighed . â€œMaybe.â€ In other words , yes . I beamed . â€œMaybe we could come up early and go apple pickâ€”â€
112400	112679	112687	112687	she	955	surprisedâ€”I was the best . The guy who replaced me was fine as a placeholder , but even he knew his tenure at Archer had reached the end of the road when I walked into my office four months ago . That office had always been mine , no matter who occupied the chair . The board had been all too happy to have me back , and Archerâ€ ™ s stock jumped twenty - four percent when my reinstatement as CEO hit the papers . I did have a better work - life balance now that Ava had moved into my Logan Circle penthouse , mainly because Iâ€ ™ d much rather be eating her out on our bed than eating takeout at my desk . I left the office around six these days , much to the relief of my staff . â€œSunshine?â€ I called out , kicking the front door closed behind me . I hung my coat on the rack and waited for a response . Nothing . Ava , who worked as a junior freelance photographer for World Geographic and a few other magazines , was usually home by this time . Worry flickered in my stomach before I heard the squeak of the faucet turning and the faint but unmistakable sound of the shower running . My shoulders relaxed . I was still paranoid about her safety and had hired a permanent bodyguard to look after her , much to her dismay . Weâ€ ™ d had an all - out , knockdown fight over it , followed by equally all - out , knockdown makeup sex , but weâ€ ™ d eventually compromisedâ€”weâ€
112954	112980	112949	112952	people on the inside	2475	himâ€”and making his life more than a little uncomfortable . If he so much as uttered Avaâ€ ™ s name , Iâ€ ™ d know about itâ€”and

She had me doing all sorts of crazy things these days , like giving up coffee and sticking to a sleep schedule . She said it would help with my insomnia , and yeah , I slept more hours than I used to , but that had more to do with having Ava by my side than anything else . Besides , I still sneak the occasional cup of coffee at the office . I was about to enter the bathroom when something the newscaster said caught my attention . I stopped short , sure Iâ€ ™ d heard wrong , but the scrolling chyron across the bottom of the screen confirmed what Iâ€ ™ d heard . The sound of the running shower switched off , and the rumble of the stall door sliding open filtered into the bedroom . â€œAva?â€ There was a brief pause and a faint rustle . â€œYouâ€ ™ re home early!â€ Ava stepped out of the bathroom in a swirl of steam , hair and skin damp , with nothing but a towel wrapped around her slender frame . She beamed when she saw me , and my face softened . â€œSlow day in the office.â€ I dropped a kiss on her mouth . My cock stirred with interest , and I was tempted to rip off her towel and take her right there against the wall , but there was something she needed to know before we started one of our all - nighters . â€œDid you hear from Bridget today?â€ â€œNo.â€ Avaâ€ ™ s brow furrowed . â€œWhy?â€ â€œCheck out the news.â€ I angled my head toward the TV , where the newscaster spoke a mile a minute . Ava paused , listening to the update before her jaw dropped . I didnâ€ ™ t blame her . Because what just happened ? It hadnâ€ ™ t happened in over 200 years of Eldorran history . The newscasterâ€ ™ s high - pitched voice filled the room , so excited it trembled . â€œâ€ ¦ Crown Prince Nikolai has abdicated the throne of Eldorra to marry Sabrina Philips , the American flight attendant he met last year during a diplomatic trip to New York . Eldorran law stipulates the countryâ€ ™ s monarchs must marry someone of noble birth . His sister , Princess Bridget , is now first in line to the throne . When she becomes Queen , she will be Eldorraâ€ ™ s first female monarch in more than a centuryâ€ ¦ â€
