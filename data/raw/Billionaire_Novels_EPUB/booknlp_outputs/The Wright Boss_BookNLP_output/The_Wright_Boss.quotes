5002	5006	5007	5007	I	0	“ Come again ? ”
5010	5025	5007	5007	I	0	“ I left Miranda at home to come here because I ’m leaving her . ”
5120	5123	5124	5124	I	0	“ Wow , ”
5140	5156	5157	5157	He	87	“ I mean … how awful . That has to be so hard , Landon . ”
5163	5170	5157	5157	He	87	“ Heidi , you ’re cute . ”
5180	5199	5171	5171	I	0	“ I tell you I ’m sorry about your wife , and you tell me I ’m cute ? ”
5200	5217	5157	5157	He	87	“ You ca n’t hide how much you hate Miranda any more than my family can . ”
5218	5221	5222	5222	I	0	“ Hey , ”
5230	5244	5222	5222	I	0	“ I do n’t hate Miranda . I do n’t even know her . ”
5245	5260	5157	5157	He	87	“ Well , if you knew her , you ’d hate her , too . ”
5261	5265	5266	5266	I	0	“ Maybe so , ”
5269	5289	5266	5266	I	0	“ But that does n’t make things any easier for you . Clearly , you must have loved her . ”
5290	5297	5298	5298	he	334	“ It ’s just … yeah , ”
5301	5312	5298	5298	he	334	“ I do n’t know . It all happened today . ”
5313	5339	5340	5340	He	334	“ No wonder you ’re drunk and acting like a fool . Maybe we should have addressed you leaving Miranda first and made out second . ”
5344	5355	5340	5340	He	334	“ So , we ’re going to make out again ? ”
5356	5359	5360	5360	I	0	“ No , ”
5395	5406	5380	5380	I	0	“ We should n’t have kissed in the first place . ”
5639	5650	5651	5651	Landon	87	“ Yeah , I probably should n’t have kissed you , ”
5664	5677	5654	5654	He	87	“ But I ’d been thinking about it since New Year ’s . ”
5678	5705	5706	5706	I	0	“ Landon , you ca n’t come here and talk to me like this . If you want to talk about Miranda , I ’m here . ”
5733	5751	5714	5714	I	0	“ We can talk after the reunion , but now , maybe try to forget about it . ”
5752	5758	5770	5770	He	87	“ About Miranda or you ? ”
5759	5762	5714	5714	I	0	“ Both . ”

6198	6206	6207	6207	Emery	80	“ Let ’s do it , baby ! ”
6228	6236	6210	6210	She	80	“ Peter , I need the salt ! ”

6264	6269	6270	6270	Emery	80	“ Hand it over ! ”
6273	6288	6289	6289	I	0	“ It ’s really not a reunion if we are n’t drunk and ridiculous , ”
6292	6298	6299	6299	Emery	80	“ Let ’s be real , ”
6302	6333	6299	6299	Emery	80	“ It ’s not a reunion if we ’re not drunk on wine coolers and running from the cops because Landon has pot and is afraid he ’ll get arrested . ”
6362	6365	6366	6366	Jensen	79	“ Honey , ”
6374	6383	6366	6366	Jensen	79	“ what in the hell are you doing ? ”

6499	6520	6521	6521	he	79	“ There were a lot of things you two did in high school that do n’t need to be repeated , ”
6524	6528	6529	6529	Emery	80	“ Party pooper , ”
6534	6562	6529	6529	Emery	80	“ Do n’t listen to him , Em . He ’s jealous because I get to take the shot . We all know he ’s done worse . ”
6695	6701	6702	6702	Landon	87	“ What did I miss ? ”

6737	6761	6762	6762	Landon	87	“ You do n’t have any weed on you , do you ? Emery reminded us that you used to be a pothead . ”
6776	6783	6784	6784	Emery	80	“ I was not a pothead . ”
6790	6808	6784	6784	Emery	80	“ Nah , you were too scared of getting caught to be a full - blown pothead . ”
6809	6822	6823	6823	Jensen	79	“ Actually , I think he was too afraid of our dad , ”
6830	6840	6827	6827	Landon	87	“ Well , he could be a scary motherfucker . ”

6984	6987	6988	6988	Landon	87	“ Brandon , ”

7017	7035	7036	7036	Brandon	95	“ Fuck , man . I would n’t have missed it . High school was the shit , ”
7039	7063	7036	7036	Brandon	95	“ Though who am I kidding ? You killed it in high school , and look at you now ! Fucking PGA Tour ! ”
7126	7131	7132	7132	Landon	87	“ Thanks , man , ”
7149	7156	7157	7157	he	87	“ Heidi Martin . Fuck me , ”
7167	7188	7157	7157	he	87	“ You look even hotter than you did in high school , and you were fucking gorgeous ten years ago . ”
7227	7232	7233	7233	I	0	“ Thanks , Brandon , ”
7242	7249	7233	7233	I	0	“ You look great , too . ”

7268	7283	7284	7284	he	87	“ Definitely . But , first , I ’m going to steal Landon here , ”
7295	7306	7284	7284	he	87	“ and get the rest of the football team together . ”
7482	7485	7486	7486	Emery	80	“ Whoa ! ”
7489	7504	7486	7486	Emery	80	“ Brandon McCain is so fucking into you . Hello , dream come true ! ”
7505	7508	7509	7509	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
7512	7517	7518	7518	Emery	80	“ Dream come true . ”
7525	7576	7520	7520	her	80	“ Okay , roomie , we ’re supposed to be having a good time . You know I hate reunions and basically all things high school . But I ’m here for you because I love your face . Tell me what ’s wrong , so I can fix it . ”
7577	7582	7520	7520	her	80	“ Nothing ’s wrong . ”
7583	7634	7635	7635	I	0	“ News flash , Martin ! Brandon fucking McCain just hit on you , and you ’re sad . You would have blown that guy behind the bleachers after a game if he ’d let you . What part of him thinking you ’re super hot is a bad thing ? ”
7764	7770	7771	7771	I	0	“ You ’re so right , ”
7781	7792	7771	7771	I	0	“ There is not a damn thing wrong with that . ”
7793	7810	7771	7771	I	0	“ You sure ? You seemed a little out of it . Maybe you and Landon … ”
7811	7873	7920	7920	she	80	“ Please , do not finish that thought . Landon and I do not belong in the same sentence . You ’ve bugged me about it in the past , Em , but he ’s married . You know what my dad was like . You know I could never do that . And I could never do that to you . ”
7874	7882	7883	7883	I	0	“ But it does n’t bother me . ”
7889	7912	7883	7883	I	0	“ Irrelevant . It bothers me ! Now , let ’s talk about Brandon McCain and how he just hit on me . ”
7946	7976	7977	7977	Emery	80	“ Okay , are you going to hook up with him ? Because he went from being like gruff hottie in high school to being an LA pretty boy , ”
7980	7993	7977	7977	Emery	80	“ I do n’t know if you could fuck a pretty boy . ”
7994	8004	7928	7928	she	80	“ Oh , I could . I assure you . ”
8005	8017	8018	8018	I	0	“ Plus , he used brah in a sentence without irony . ”
8030	8064	8018	8018	I	0	“ So , he ’s not the sharpest tool in the shed . As long as he has a big , long tool I can use , then we ’re good to go . ”
8065	8070	8071	8071	Emery	80	“ Oh my God ! ”
8079	8092	8071	8071	Emery	80	“ I pray that he does , for your sake , Heidi . ”
8610	8619	8620	8620	Emery	80	“ Ugh , who sent in these pictures ? ”
8865	8875	8876	8876	Emery	80	“ Well , I ’d call this a success , ”

8931	8958	8971	8971	her	421	“ True . Also , people have actually changed … sort of … since then . Everyone had just graduated college at the five - year . ”

9337	9367	9368	9368	I	0	“ Yep . No worries . We have cabs coming at closing to get people . I ’ll make the football players carry him into one . No big , ”
9438	9454	9455	9455	Emery	80	“ Do n’t worry about a thing . Go have a lot of monkey sex . ”

9950	9956	9957	9957	I	0	“ Funny you say that , ”
9963	10025	9957	9957	I	0	“ I would say that I ’ve changed a lot , but you would n’t know that , as you ’ve spent the entire time talking to me about your awesome life in LA and all the roles you could have gotten but missed . I ’m not interested . You missed your chance to get someone as amazing as me . ”
10238	10271	10232	10232	he	87	“ Landon , I told Jensen I ’d get you into a cab at bar close . It ’s two . Time to go back to Austin ’s and sleep this off . ”

12483	12488	12430	12430	Austin	78	“ She was here ? ”
12489	12515	12516	12516	Austin	78	“ Bro , were you that fucked up that you do n’t remember fucking her ? Because that would explain why she looked so upset , ”
12519	12527	12516	12516	Austin	78	“ You think I slept with her ? ”
12537	12587	12528	12528	I	0	“ I mean , I do n’t know for sure , but why else would a hot chick be leaving your room at two thirty in the morning ? Plus , with the shit going down with Miranda , I thought you ’d wanted some fun at this reunion . ”
12588	12594	12516	12516	Austin	78	“ What stuff with Miranda ? ”
12595	12611	12528	12528	I	0	“ Dunno , man . Ca n’t be good if you ’re here without her . ”

12650	12661	12528	12528	I	0	“ Fuck . I ’m screwed , are n’t I ? ”
12662	12670	12671	12671	Austin	78	“ As far as I see it . ”
12679	12690	12671	12671	Austin	78	“ I think you need this more than I do . ”
12691	12707	12708	12708	I	0	“ Thanks , but I have to figure out what the fuck happened last night . ”
12774	12796	12767	12767	her	507	“ Hi , this is Heidi . You know I hate voice mails . If it ’s important , text me . ”
12812	12817	12818	12818	I	0	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”

13015	13040	12976	12976	she	507	“ Because leaving me at two thirty in the morning , drunk off my ass , is not how you wanted to end things . ”
13041	13051	13109	13109	her	507	“ Yeah . How are you feeling this morning ? ”
13052	13068	13069	13069	I	0	“ Hungover and with a severe lack of memory of several hours of last night , ”
13072	13076	13077	13077	she	507	“ I see , ”
13080	13090	13077	13077	she	507	“ Care to fill me in on the details ? ”
13091	13103	13104	13104	she	507	“ Nothing happened , if that ’s what you ’re asking , ”
13112	13149	13104	13104	she	507	“ I told you I would n’t do anything with you while you were still with Miranda . Anyway , do you think I ’d take advantage of someone as drunk as you were last night ? ”
13150	13179	13109	13109	her	507	“ No , I did n’t think you would . I just did n’t know if I ’d made a total fool of myself in front of you . ”
13180	13234	13235	13235	I	0	“ If insinuating that I was going to fuck Brandon McCain because he ’d flattered me with his obnoxious attention , getting so wasted that you were drinking beer straight from a pitcher , and blacking out as soon as I got you into bed make you a total fool , then yes . ”
13267	13276	13109	13109	her	507	“ Yeah . Sorry about all of that . ”
13277	13303	13109	13109	her	507	“ It ’s fine , Landon . It ’s fine . I should just go . I do n’t think we should be talking anymore . ”

13319	13328	13109	13109	her	507	“ Yeah , and then you got wasted ! ”

13339	13347	13348	13348	she	509	“ You can not ask me out ! ”
13351	13375	13348	13348	she	509	“ It ’s just brunch , Heidi . You said we ’d talk after the reunion . Can I call in that favor ? ”
13376	13379	13109	13109	her	507	“ No . ”
13380	13383	13384	13384	I	0	“ Heidi , ”
13387	13390	13384	13384	I	0	“ Please . ”
13404	13414	13391	13391	She	509	“ Fine . Brunch . Half hour enough time ? ”
13415	13430	13109	13109	her	507	“ Yes , that ’s plenty of time . Thank you . Café J ? ”
13431	13443	13444	13444	I	0	“ All right . I ’ll see you there , Landon . ”

13645	13657	13638	13638	his	79	“ Yeah . Last night was rough . What ’s up ? ”
13658	13672	13638	13638	his	79	“ Miranda just showed up at my door , demanding to see you . ”
13673	13678	13679	13679	I	0	“ She did what ? ”
13682	13713	13679	13679	I	0	“ I guess she took the early flight out of Tampa this morning and just got into town . She came straight here , thinking that you would be here . ”
13714	13725	13726	13726	Jensen	79	“ Did you tell her I was at Austin ’s ? ”
13729	13740	13726	13726	Jensen	79	“ Of course I did . She ’s your wife . ”
13741	13746	13679	13679	I	0	“ Fuck , Jensen . ”
13747	13775	13776	13776	I	0	“ Handle your shit , Landon , or let me help . Otherwise , you ’re going to keep ending up right back at this same place . ”

13914	13921	13922	13922	I	0	“ Miranda is on her way , ”
13946	13953	13935	13935	Austin	78	“ That ’s bad , right ? ”
13954	13975	13937	13937	his	78	“ Probably . I have to make a phone call . Will you answer the door if she shows up ? ”
13976	14003	13937	13937	his	78	“ Well , I was going to see if you wanted to get lunch with me and Patrick , but that sounds out of the question . ”
14004	14022	13935	13935	Austin	78	“ Yeah , I do n’t think I ’ll be able to hang with you guys now . ”
14033	14049	14025	14025	I	0	“ Can you answer ? I have to make a call before she gets here . ”
14050	14056	14057	14057	Austin	78	“ I ’ll run interference , ”
14169	14179	14180	14180	I	0	“ Pick up , pick up , pick up , ”
14223	14226	14227	14227	I	0	“ Fuck , ”

14306	14318	14298	14298	she	517	“ He ’s a bit hungover , but he ’s here . ”
14333	14338	14327	14327	He	78	“ Come on in . ”
14456	14459	14460	14460	she	77	“ Landon ! ”
14482	14489	14468	14468	She	77	“ I ’ve been so worried . ”
14550	14559	14560	14560	I	0	“ Hey , what are you doing here ? ”
14571	14578	14579	14579	she	77	“ What am I doing here ? ”
14584	14603	14579	14579	she	77	“ After you walked out of the house without me , what did you expect me to do ? ”
14604	14610	14611	14611	Her	77	“ Stay home in Tampa . ”
14615	14658	14611	14611	Her	77	“ I could never do that , Landon . You had to know I could never watch you walk away and be okay with it . I was devastated . I had to follow you . I had to make this right . ”
14664	14691	14661	14661	his	78	“ Sorry to interrupt . I ’m going to … head out and get some lunch with Patrick . Let me know if you need anything . ”

14797	14847	14870	14870	her	77	“ You know I did n’t . I was frustrated and worried about you when you heard me on the phone with Janice . It ’s not every day that we have to face the news from your doctor that you might never be able to play golf again . ”
14956	14969	14970	14970	I	0	“ No , I ’d hoped to never have to hear that , ”
14973	15020	14970	14970	I	0	“ But I also did n’t expect for you to tell Janice that you did n’t want to have kids after we ’d spent the last year doing everything possible to make that happen , then blow up on me when I asked you about it . ”
15058	15063	15064	15064	she	528	“ I ’m sorry , ”
15067	15083	15064	15064	she	528	“ I ’m so sorry . It was a joke between girls . I swear . ”
15084	15152	15038	15038	Her	528	“ Well , it was n’t a funny joke considering we lost a child and I ’ve catered to your every whim the last year in an attempt to make it right . Then you tell her that you do n’t want a kid to end up like a Wright so you ’re not having one . Excuse me if I do n’t think that ’s funny . ”
15153	15158	15159	15159	she	528	“ It was stress , ”
15163	15240	15159	15159	she	528	“ I know I should n’t have said it . I did n’t mean it . Everything I said was me being worried about your career and came out all wrong . It was n’t anything else . I want you to get better . I want you to do what you love again . You know that you ’re my first priority . Always . And I flew all this way to make it right . ”

17074	17124	17057	17057	My	0	“ Yeah . Like the crazy bitch lady who screams at me every time she sees me even though she knows that Jensen and I are together and I have no interest in Landon . She ’s a total monster . Jensen detests her , to put it mildly . ”

17220	17263	17166	17166	I	0	“ Not sure . What I gathered from her clipped conversation with Jensen was that they ’d had an argument , Landon had threatened to leave her , and she was here to make things right . Whatever the hell that means . ”

22557	22575	22544	22544	He	111	“ Why would they bring everyone together to fire someone ? Is n’t that kind of personal ? ”
22576	22590	22544	22544	He	111	“ Yeah , true . Maybe it ’s a new project or something . ”
22591	22628	22629	22629	Matt	111	“ After we took over Tarman Corporation last year , I do not want to think about adding on another new project . I feel like we ’ve finally caught up from how shitty they were . ”
22639	22644	22629	22629	Matt	111	“ Yeah , definitely . ”

23385	23423	23472	23472	she	85	“ Do n’t worry . It does n’t change anything with what you already do . We have recently hired on a new employee who will be filling the void in this area . Is that clear ? ”
23430	23463	23464	23464	Morgan	85	“ We can work out the kinks as we go , but I think this will be a good solution for everyone involved . Let me introduce you to your new boss , ”

24714	24726	24654	24654	His	111	“ Well , not Sutton . She just had her baby . ”
24727	24732	24733	24733	Matt	111	“ Right . True , ”
24736	24745	24733	24733	Matt	111	“ What did she name it ? James ? ”
24746	24752	24654	24654	His	111	“ She named him Jason . ”
24753	24780	24654	24654	His	111	“ I still ca n’t believe that he took her last name instead of the other way around . I ca n’t imagine ever doing that . ”
24781	24801	24802	24802	I	0	“ Ah , yes . How ever did women survive all these generations , dealing with changing their name ? ”
24809	24836	24802	24802	I	0	“ It makes sense that he ’d change his name , considering who Sutton is . Then , they can have the baby be a Wright . ”
24837	24842	24843	24843	My	0	“ It ’s emasculating . ”
24852	24871	24872	24872	He	770	“ And how do you think women feel , having to change their name to fit a man ? ”
24892	24896	24897	24897	I	0	“ Forget it , ”
24907	24958	24959	24959	Jim	110	“ A lot of women really love the idea of changing their name . Maybe Maverick suggested it . Maybe it was n’t emasculating to him at all . At the very least , I ’m sure that he wanted his son to be Jason Wright instead of Jason Johnson . ”
24973	24990	24959	24959	Jim	110	“ Hey , Heidi . The new Wright boss wants to see you in his office . ”
24991	24995	24996	24996	I	0	“ Right now ? ”
25006	25015	24996	24996	I	0	“ Uh … yeah , I think so . ”
25016	25026	25027	25027	Jim	110	“ Oh , okay . Where is his office ? ”
25136	25139	25140	25140	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
25338	25341	25342	25342	he	87	“ Heidi , ”
25345	25354	25342	25342	he	87	“ Please come in . Shut the door . ”
25419	25426	25427	25427	I	0	“ You asked to see me , ”
25435	25456	25427	25427	I	0	“ Yes . I ’ve decided to meet with everyone on my team to get to know my new employees . ”
25486	25495	25496	25496	Landon	87	“ And you decided to start with me ? ”
25528	25531	25532	25532	he	87	“ Yes , ”
25536	25544	25532	25532	he	87	“ I decided to start with you . ”
25545	25582	25583	25583	Landon	87	“ Let ’s not do this , Landon . I ’m pretty sure we already know that you know me better than most of your employees . And that ’s all I am — an employee . ”
25642	25654	25655	25655	he	87	“ Do n’t you want to know why I ’m here ? ”
25665	25671	25659	25659	I	0	“ It does n’t matter . ”
25679	25682	25672	25672	He	87	“ Heidi — ”
25683	25712	25713	25713	Landon	87	“ It really does n’t . This is my career . I ’ve worked hard to get to where I am . I was n’t born into this . ”
25767	25779	25780	25780	I	0	“ Not that you do n’t deserve your position or anything , ”
25783	25826	25780	25780	I	0	“ But I think we should keep our relationship professional . Having conversations with the door closed … is probably not a good idea . There ’s no reason to muddy the waters . You know … what ’s done is done . ”
25827	25836	25837	25837	His	87	“ Right . Good . Yeah . Professional . ”
25842	25849	25850	25850	I	0	“ Good . I ’m glad , ”
25899	25910	25911	25911	Landon	87	“ I believe that is all then , Miss Martin , ”
25952	25964	25965	25965	I	0	“ I ’ll just get back to work then … boss . ”
26131	26134	26135	26135	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
26156	26164	26165	26165	I	0	“ This is never going to work , ”
26606	26611	26612	26612	Morgan	85	“ What ’s up ? ”
26615	26627	26612	26612	Morgan	85	“ I appreciate everything you did to get me this job . ”
26633	26638	26630	26630	her	85	“ Are you quitting ? ”
26639	26644	26630	26630	her	85	“ Um … no ? ”
26645	26656	26657	26657	I	0	“ Who are you ? Ben from Parks and Rec ? ”
26664	26682	26683	26683	Morgan	85	“ Last I checked , I was n’t an accountant who kept refusing to work for you . ”
26686	26694	26683	26683	Morgan	85	“ Well , what ’s the issue ? ”
26695	26702	26726	26726	She	273	“ I want to switch positions . ”
26703	26708	26709	26709	I	0	“ You … what ? ”
26774	26786	26787	26787	I	0	“ I think I need to be in a new job , ”
26790	26793	26794	26794	she	273	“ Landon , ”
26811	26914	26794	26794	she	273	“ do you know what we went through to get you this job on such short notice ? We had to shuffle and reorganize the company . I essentially invented a job for you in a place where another position could fit seamlessly into the structure already in place . I had to analyze all the jobs from top to bottom , and this job is it . I mean , if you want to go work on a construction site , then by all means , we have plenty of jobs . Not sure your back could handle the machinery though . ”
26915	26927	26928	26928	I	0	“ Yeah , yeah . My back ca n’t handle much , ”
27007	27055	27056	27056	She	819	“ So , as you can see , this is the best I can offer . I did n’t think you ’d want to actually work in construction … or even if that was possible for you . And , really , my secretary position is filled . ”
27059	27076	27056	27056	She	819	“ Ha ! I would never work as your secretary . We ’d kill one another . ”
27077	27095	27056	27056	She	819	“ I ’m pretty sure , with the condition you ’ve been in , I ’d win . ”
27096	27103	27056	27056	She	819	“ We ’ll see about that . ”
27104	27107	27108	27108	Morgan	85	“ So , ”
27111	27134	27108	27108	Morgan	85	“ why do n’t you want this job now that I ’ve gone to all this work to get it for you ? ”
27238	27245	27246	27246	Morgan	85	“ Come on , tell me , ”
27249	27258	27246	27246	Morgan	85	“ I guess I ’m just not qualified , ”
27275	27302	27262	27262	Morgan	85	“ You have a Stanford business degree . You graduated in the top ten percent of your class . You know how to run a business . ”
27303	27314	27262	27262	Morgan	85	“ Well , I do n’t really have any experience . ”
27315	27335	27336	27336	She	85	“ God , stop . You know more about Wright Construction than anyone could because you are Wright Construction . ”
27346	27373	27336	27336	She	85	“ Just do your job , and you ’ll be fine . Everyone always likes you . They ’ll see you know what you ’re doing . ”
27379	27390	27374	27374	I	0	“ Right . Yeah . Sorry to bring it up . ”
27564	27577	27559	27559	Morgan	85	“ You ’ll be back at your game before you know it . ”
27587	27594	27578	27578	I	0	“ What if I ’m not ? ”
27595	27626	27627	27627	I	0	“ Do n’t doubt it . I believe in a healthy dose of optimism . You love it too much . And , anyway , Wrights do n’t give up . ”
28789	28792	28793	28793	Landon	87	“ Hey , ”
28812	28815	28796	28796	He	87	“ Hey . ”

28866	28878	28860	28860	I	0	“ Yeah . It ’s Friday . Is that a problem ? ”
28884	28893	28881	28881	his	87	“ Nope . Not a problem with me . ”
28894	28897	28898	28898	I	0	“ Great , ”
28901	28910	28898	28898	I	0	“ I did n’t think I needed permission . ”
28932	28943	28911	28911	His	87	“ You do n’t . Not from me at least . ”
28944	28947	28948	28948	I	0	“ Wonderful , ”
28972	28981	28952	28952	I	0	“ Heidi , can we not do this ? ”
28982	28996	28997	28997	Landon	87	“ Oh , I ’m Heidi now ? What happened to Miss Martin ? ”
29015	29038	28997	28997	Landon	87	“ If we ’re going to be around each other , then we should maybe try to be civil . Friends even . ”
29039	29046	29047	29047	I	0	“ We are friends , Landon , ”
29054	29058	29047	29047	I	0	“ Just friends . ”
29228	29231	29232	29232	I	0	“ What ? ”
29241	29251	29232	29232	I	0	“ Do n’t walk out of here like this . ”
29257	29266	29252	29252	I	0	“ It ’s only a half hour early . ”

29349	29356	29357	29357	he	87	“ Let me start a list , ”
29365	29378	29357	29357	he	87	“ Your wife showed up , and that was that , Landon , ”
29389	29396	29379	29379	I	0	“ That is not what happened . ”
29446	29453	29440	29440	I	0	“ Just do n’t , okay ? ”

30624	30637	30617	30617	I	0	“ He ’s doing fine , but it ’s just … weird . ”
30638	30652	30560	30560	I	0	“ Weird because you ’re into him or because of the whole situation ? ”
30653	30656	30657	30657	I	0	“ Stop ! ”

30783	30831	30733	30733	she	880	“ Yeah , right . I ’ve known you since kindergarten . I know when you ’re playing along , and I know when you ’re invested . You ’re dating this Nick guy because Julia wants to have someone to hang out with her and Trevor . ”
30832	30838	30839	30839	I	0	“ But he is nice . ”
30846	30851	30852	30852	she	80	“ Nice ? Gross , ”
30860	30891	30852	30852	she	80	“ Whoever wanted nice ? Try passion and fire and need . You ca n’t settle for someone who is nice . You want someone you ca n’t live without . ”
30892	30901	30902	30902	Emery	80	“ Thank you , Queen of Bad Relationships . ”
30907	30927	30902	30902	Emery	80	“ Hey ! I might have had some bad relationships in the past , but I give good advice . ”
30928	30939	30852	30852	she	80	“ So , you think I should cancel with Nick ? ”
30940	30943	30944	30944	she	80	“ No ! ”
30947	30986	30944	30944	she	80	“ I think you should definitely go on a date with Nick . Then , you ’ll realize what you do n’t want . Because I already know it ’s not him . You seem oblivious to it . ”
31975	31979	31968	31969	The hostess	546	“ How many ? ”

36387	36394	36395	36395	I	0	“ Just a fun party trick , ”
36398	36423	36395	36395	I	0	“ Well , I think it ’s pretty amazing . I ’m shit at pool . I ’ve only played once in my life . ”

37750	37802	37657	37657	He	87	“ You ’re right . You do know me , Heidi . That ’s the point . You ’ve been avoiding me and walking away from me and refusing to listen to me all week when I ’ve been standing right in front of you , trying to make things right . ”
37803	37814	37657	37657	He	87	“ Maybe I do n’t want to make things right . ”

37831	37879	37824	37824	Landon	87	“ The guy is so oblivious , he ca n’t even see what ’s right in front of his eyes . I could have made out with you on the pool table , and he would have clapped his hands and applauded at how good you are . ”

38090	38137	37939	37939	he	87	“ You ca n’t possibly know that . That ’s such an incredibly naive way of thinking . Julia is one of my closest friends . I know that she has fired people or moved people to different branches of the company for less than this . ”
38138	38161	38162	38162	He	1021	“ Less than what ? One kiss before I was your boss ? Because you keep telling me there ’s nothing here . ”
38170	38193	38162	38162	He	1021	“ Or is it that there is something here ? And we are something more , but you refuse to acknowledge it . ”
38259	38271	38272	38272	I	0	“ What part of date do you not get , Landon ? ”
38279	38289	38290	38290	he	1021	“ The part where you ’re not with me ! ”
38293	38298	38290	38290	he	1021	“ You are married ! ”
38299	38320	38276	38276	him	1021	“ Well , if you ’d just fucking talk to me , you would know that I ’m divorcing her ! ”
38321	38326	38327	38327	I	0	“ Wait … what ? ”
38333	38341	38327	38327	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m leaving her ! ”
38347	38372	38342	38342	I	0	“ You said that last time , and you still went running back to her like a dog with his tail between his legs . ”
38373	38381	38382	38382	he	1021	“ Is that what you think happened ? ”
38392	38455	38382	38382	he	1021	“ Last time , we were separated . I ’d told her I was leaving her . And , now , I officially am , Heidi . I did n’t know she would be in town that day . I had no clue what kind of shit she was trying to pull . I ’m here trying to fix my fucking mistakes . ”
38464	38471	38382	38382	he	1021	“ You ’re really leaving her ? ”
38472	38475	38476	38476	His	1021	“ Yes . ”
38654	38659	38660	38660	he	1021	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”
38762	38765	38742	38742	He	1021	“ Landon … ”
38766	38773	38742	38742	He	1021	“ Come back home with me . ”
38774	38779	38780	38780	I	0	“ I ca n’t , ”
38817	38828	38829	38829	he	1021	“ This is what I wanted if I ’d won , ”
38832	38836	38829	38829	he	1021	“ Just you . ”
38983	38986	38978	38978	I	0	“ No . ”
38987	38990	38991	38991	he	87	“ No ? ”
38998	39002	38991	38991	he	87	“ No what ? ”
39003	39010	38978	38978	I	0	“ This does n’t change anything . ”
39011	39018	38978	38978	I	0	“ What the hell , Heidi ? ”
39019	39035	39036	39036	I	0	“ You just dropping on me that you ’re leaving Miranda does n’t change anything , ”
39040	39073	39036	39036	I	0	“ Of course not . I tell you I ’m leaving my wife and that I want to be with you , and that means nothing to you ? Makes perfect sense . ”
39074	39089	38978	38978	I	0	“ But you have n’t left her yet ! You ’re still with her ! ”
39090	39109	39110	39110	he	87	“ Legally , we ’re separated . And in another couple of months , we ’ll be divorced , ”
39113	39151	39110	39110	he	87	“ You want to wait around for her to sign a document that I initiated and already signed . One that says our marriage is irretrievably broken and that we ’re unable to mend our irreconcilable differences . ”
39152	39199	39200	39200	Landon	87	“ I do n’t know , Landon . I do n’t know about any of that . It ’s all too much at once . I ’m on a date with someone else , and you ’re trying to seduce me . That ’s fucked up . ”
39326	39331	39332	39332	he	87	“ You ’re right , ”
39336	39340	39332	39332	he	87	“ I am ? ”
39341	39362	39332	39332	he	87	“ Yes . This was n’t what I wanted to happen . And I ’m sorry for ruining your date . ”
39363	39367	39368	39368	I	0	“ You are ? ”
39379	39388	39389	39389	His	87	“ I went about this the wrong way . ”
39394	39440	39389	39389	His	87	“ I do want this with you , Heidi , but I ’m not going to push you if you ’re not ready . If you want to wait until the divorce is finalized , then I can wait . I ’ll wait for you . ”
39582	39589	39570	39570	he	87	“ You ’ll wait for me ? ”
39590	39609	39610	39610	I	0	“ As long as you need . But just don’t … settle for that guy in the meantime . ”
39633	39654	39625	39625	He	87	“ I ’ll rally the troops and head out . I really do n’t want to hurt you , Heidi . ”
39719	39722	39723	39723	I	0	“ Landon , ”
39731	39734	39723	39723	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
39735	39739	39740	39740	He	87	“ Thank you . ”
39753	39758	39759	39759	Austin	78	“ Hey , guys ! ”
39774	39791	39759	39759	Austin	78	“ You might want to break up the lovefest because homeboy is going to get suspicious . ”
39822	39827	39828	39828	Landon	87	“ It ’s fine , ”
39832	39838	39828	39828	Landon	87	“ We ’re heading out . ”
39839	39843	39844	39844	Austin	78	“ We are ? ”
39847	39854	39844	39844	Austin	78	“ Yeah . Let ’s go . ”
39855	39861	39862	39862	Landon	87	“ But what about Heidi ? ”
39886	39902	39868	39868	his	87	“ She collected her winnings . Maybe I ’ll come out on top another night . ”
40240	40245	40246	40246	Landon	87	“ It ’s open , ”
40287	40290	40291	40291	I	0	“ Hey , ”
40305	40308	40309	40309	he	87	“ Heidi , ”
40317	40321	40309	40309	he	87	“ Early morning ? ”
40322	40330	40294	40294	His	87	“ Christ , what time is it ? ”
40331	40334	40335	40335	I	0	“ Nine , ”
40346	40362	40338	40338	He	87	“ Yeah , early morning . I did n’t even know people were here yet . ”
40363	40370	40294	40294	His	87	“ When did you get in ? ”
40371	40381	40294	40294	His	87	“ Oh , I was here around six thirty . ”
40382	40387	40388	40388	He	87	“ In the morning ? ”
40391	40398	40388	40388	He	87	“ Yes , in the morning . ”
40399	40410	40294	40294	His	87	“ Whatever for ? We do n’t start until nine . ”
40489	40517	40475	40475	Landon	87	“ Well , I have physical therapy Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday afternoons and Monday and Friday mornings , so I come when I ’m finished . ”
40518	40522	40523	40523	My	0	“ Physical therapy ? ”
40529	40533	40523	40523	My	0	“ For what ? ”
40534	40543	40544	40544	he	87	“ Oh , we ’re asking questions now ? ”
40589	40602	40584	40584	He	87	“ I ’m kidding . I injured my back over the summer . ”
40603	40606	40607	40607	I	0	“ Again ? ”
40644	40647	40648	40648	he	87	“ Yes , ”
40693	40708	40709	40709	I	0	“ Well , I ’m glad you ’re taking care of it this time , ”
40713	40723	40709	40709	I	0	“ Me , too . It ’s long overdue . ”
40724	40727	40728	40728	I	0	“ So , ”
40731	40741	40728	40728	I	0	“ are you coming to Emery ’s party today ? ”
40742	40754	40709	40709	I	0	“ Already on the schedule to head out early for it . ”
40755	40763	40709	40709	I	0	“ Great . This should be fun . ”
40764	40775	40728	40728	I	0	“ You do know , she hates birthdays , right ? ”
40776	40787	40788	40788	I	0	“ Duh . It ’ll be more fun this way , ”
40795	40804	40805	40805	I	0	“ She ’s probably going to kill you . ”

41195	41221	41173	41173	She	106	“ What the hell happened with Nick ? You do n’t call . You do n’t write . You ca n’t fill a girl in ? ”
41222	41228	41173	41173	She	106	“ Did n’t work out . ”
41229	41257	41173	41173	She	106	“ What part of it did n’t work out ? Trevor was the one who told me . I think Nick is really beat up about it . ”
41258	41262	41263	41263	I	0	“ He is ? ”
41268	41286	41263	41263	I	0	“ He seemed totally fine when I let him down gently after our date on Friday night . ”
41295	41303	41287	41287	Julia	106	“ You dumped him on your date ? ”
41304	41322	41173	41173	She	106	“ Well , we were n’t really dating . So , I did n’t really dump him . ”
41323	41336	41292	41292	her	106	“ It was date three . I thought things were going somewhere . ”
41337	41344	41287	41287	Julia	106	“ I guess they were n’t . ”
41345	41361	41362	41362	I	0	“ Come on . Give me details . I thought this was a good thing . ”
41394	41413	41414	41414	Julia	106	“ I do n’t think it was a good thing . I think it was a convenient thing . ”
41417	41433	41414	41414	Julia	106	“ All right . Back to the drawing board . Maybe Trevor has another friend . ”
41434	41441	41442	41442	I	0	“ I do n’t think so , ”
41450	41462	41442	41442	I	0	“ Could you imagine me dating another one of his friends ? ”

41514	41529	41511	41511	her	106	“ Do n’t tell Emery . She ’d be way jealous of our love . ”
41530	41536	41537	41537	I	0	“ That ’s a fact , ”
41540	41547	41537	41537	I	0	“ She ’s a jealous bitch . ”
41548	41574	41575	41575	I	0	“ With every right to be . You ’re an awesome friend and person , which is why I want to find you a guy . ”
41580	41587	41575	41575	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”

41624	41632	41633	41633	Julia	106	“ You ’ve already found someone else ! ”
41641	41668	41633	41633	Julia	106	“ Look at how happy you are . Man , I am so excited . Who is he ? When do I get to meet him ? ”

41741	41751	41732	41732	I	0	“ I kind of have this thing for Landon . ”
41752	41755	41756	41756	Julia	106	“ Landon , ”
41769	41775	41765	41765	she	106	“ Like … Landon Wright ? ”
41776	41839	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ Yeah . We kind of made out at our ten - year high school reunion , and now , he ’s here , and he ’s into me . He happened to be at the same bar as Nick and me while we were on our date , and it was night and day . The connection is there with Landon . ”
41848	41856	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ Heidi , he is your boss . ”
41857	41861	41862	41862	I	0	“ I know , ”
41865	41875	41862	41862	I	0	“ He dated your best friend for two years ! ”
41876	41883	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ I know , I know . ”
41884	41903	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ What part of this is a good idea ? You can not have a connection with Landon ! ”
41904	41908	41909	41909	I	0	“ I know , ”
41956	41972	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ I do n’t think you know . This is a bad , bad idea ! ”
41973	41976	41977	41977	I	0	“ Julia , ”
41980	41994	41977	41977	I	0	“ Seriously , I do know how bad of an idea this is . ”
41995	42012	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ I am head of HR ! You ca n’t tell me these kinds of things ! ”
42013	42039	41840	41840	Julia	106	“ Nothing is going on , Julia . Plus , I told you about this as a friend , not as the head of HR . ”
42040	42045	42046	42046	she	1052	“ Fuck , Heidi , ”
42059	42068	42069	42069	I	0	“ You have to stay away from him . ”
42072	42103	42069	42069	I	0	“ I told him the same thing on Friday night . He ’s my boss . He ’s going through a divorce . We ca n’t do this right now . ”

42215	42269	42270	42270	I	0	“ Talking about it ? You ’re going to stop doing more than talking about it . You have to completely stop , or you know I ’ll have to figure out a way to separate you two . And who do you think they ’ll move — you or a Wright brother ? ”
42377	42389	42390	42390	Julia	106	“ Tell me you understand how important this is , Heidi , ”
42399	42407	42393	42393	Her	106	“ I ’m really worried about you . ”

43258	43275	43276	43276	She	1068	“ I ’m guessing you wo n’t be happy until we cover the room in them . ”
43289	43310	43276	43276	She	1068	“ Yeah , I want Emery to try to stab me after seeing how over the top it all is . ”
43311	43317	43318	43318	I	0	“ This will definitely do , ”
43332	43347	43324	43324	Heidi	87	“ Thanks for your help . I still have a million things to do . ”
43348	43352	43353	43353	She	1068	“ No problem . ”

43489	43511	43522	43522	him	79	“ How is everything ? You ’ve been back for a while , and I feel like you ’re a stranger . ”

43572	43602	43543	43543	Jensen	79	“ Nothing more than this . PT has been great though . I do n’t know how much progress I ’ve made , but the therapist is a goddess . ”
43603	43609	43543	43543	Jensen	79	“ I got the best . ”

43673	43693	43694	43694	Jensen	79	“ Still getting texts from her every day , and she says she ’s refusing to sign the paperwork . ”
43697	43710	43694	43694	Jensen	79	“ I was afraid of that . She ’ll come around though . ”
43711	43717	43694	43694	Jensen	79	“ We can only hope . ”
43718	43724	43725	43725	I	0	“ And the new job ? ”
43820	43824	43825	43825	I	0	“ An adjustment , ”
43832	43880	43829	43829	Jensen	79	“ I knew it would be , but you ’ll make it work . You always do . I have to go get Emery now . Everyone should be arriving in the next couple of minutes . I ’ll see you when I get back with her . ”

44127	44131	44177	44177	her	1088	“ About what ? ”
44132	44152	44110	44110	people	355	“ Well … I did n’t know if I should believe what you ’d said about Miranda on Friday . ”
44153	44157	44177	44177	her	1088	“ What part ? ”
44158	44165	44166	44166	I	0	“ That you were divorcing her . ”
44191	44202	44177	44177	her	1088	“ You thought I would lie about something like that ? ”
44203	44214	44223	44223	She	1088	“ No . Not exactly . I was … cautious . ”

44283	44305	44270	44270	she	1088	“ I believe you . I do n’t think Jensen would have asked if you ’d been lying about it all . ”
44306	44318	44319	44319	I	0	“ I ’m not going to lie to you , Heidi . ”
44390	44398	44399	44399	she	1088	“ I ’m coming to realize that , ”

44800	44805	44806	44806	she	1088	“ Not good enough , ”
44809	44822	44806	44806	she	1088	“ I ’m a goner , Heidi . Ca n’t you see ? ”

45925	45937	45913	45913	I	0	“ I have not heard that song in a long time . ”
45938	45943	45944	45944	Kimber	131	“ You ’re lucky , ”
45947	45960	45944	45944	Kimber	131	“ Does she still sing it to you every time you bake ? ”
45961	45965	45913	45913	I	0	“ Often enough . ”
45966	45969	45970	45970	Emery	80	“ Hey , ”
45973	45984	45970	45970	Emery	80	“ it ’s a good song ! It ’s catchy . ”
45985	46001	46002	46002	Emery	80	“ It ’s a commercial jingle for Bagel Bites that you changed the words to . ”
46005	46012	46002	46002	Emery	80	“ And ? I ’m clever . ”
46013	46025	46026	46026	Jensen	79	“ Let ’s not argue with the birthday girl , huh ? ”

46358	46386	46353	46353	She	85	“ No , thanks . I ’m just glad we get to have this birthday party in peace without that bitch here . No offense , Landon . ”
46387	46395	46396	46396	I	0	“ Offense was intended but not taken , ”

46423	46434	46420	46420	Sutton	86	“ You could n’t have divorced her before the wedding ? ”
46435	46461	46462	46462	Sutton	86	“ Well , if you had n’t gotten knocked up at twenty - one , then we could have probably fit it into your timetable . ”
46517	46523	46524	46524	she	131	“ I have no regrets , ”
46539	46551	46552	46552	Morgan	85	“ So , are you going to finish school or what ? ”
46570	46585	46567	46567	Sutton	86	“ Eh , why bother ? I want to stay at home with Jason . ”

46838	46841	46842	46842	Patrick	101	“ Uh , ”
46846	46860	46842	46842	Patrick	101	“ I mean … you know I do n’t do labels and shit . ”

47301	47314	47288	47288	she	85	“ I did n’t realize I was making a spectacle of myself . ”
47315	47333	47334	47334	She	85	“ I do n’t think you are . I think I ’m the only one who noticed . ”
47351	47360	47345	47345	I	0	“ Well , thanks . I ’m fine . ”
47361	47376	47377	47377	She	85	“ Heidi Martin is not the kind of girl who is ever just fine . ”

47422	47425	47426	47426	She	85	“ Liar . ”
47430	47477	47426	47426	She	85	“ Well , I ’m happy for Emery . I ’m happy that she has her whole family here and her whole humongous new family here . Your family . I ’m so happy that there ’s so much love around her . She deserves that . ”
47478	47484	47345	47345	I	0	“ And you do n’t ? ”
47488	47496	47485	47485	I	0	“ I was n’t talking about me . ”
47513	47518	47497	47497	She	85	“ Were n’t you ? ”
47519	47528	47485	47485	I	0	“ It ’s silly . Forget about it . ”
47529	47545	47546	47546	I	0	“ It ’s not silly if you ’re upset . Talk to me , Heidi , ”
47550	47580	47546	47546	I	0	“ If we have anything at all , it ’s that we can talk to each other . You know that I ’m here . That I ’ll listen . ”
47598	47626	47594	47594	her	85	“ It ’s just … I do n’t have a family . So , sometimes , being around a family like yours is overwhelming . You know ? ”
47673	47677	47667	47667	Heidi	88	“ Overwhelming how ? ”
47678	47754	47776	47776	Miranda	77	“ I do n’t know . Like … it ’s hard to be around all these people who know and love each other so much and not feel kind of … jealous . I feel horrible even thinking like that , but the only family I have is Emery . And then I see all of you together and Emery ’s family , who practically took me in , and I just … want that . ”
47800	47809	47810	47810	I	0	“ You ’re not alone , you know ? ”
47813	47825	47826	47826	she	1165	“ Well , the family I do have does n’t count , ”

47855	47873	47848	47848	She	1165	“ I do n’t want to talk about him . He ’s in prison where he belongs . ”
47961	47973	47950	47951	Hank Martin	135	“ We can talk about your dad when you ’re ready . ”
47974	47981	47982	47982	she	1165	“ Do n’t hold your breath , ”
47985	48071	47982	47982	she	1165	“ In the meantime , you are not alone . Emery might be tried and true , but I ’m not going anywhere . You do n’t have to want a family like that when we ’re standing right in front of you , accepting you into the fold . It might take some getting used to . I know we ’re an … interesting bunch . But you never have to search for family again when you have mine right in front of you . ”
48189	48200	48173	48173	Heidi	88	“ You sure know how to calm a girl down . ”
48201	48207	48208	48208	Heidi	88	“ Just you , Heidi . ”
48211	48224	48208	48208	Heidi	88	“ Knowing your track record , I have to agree with that . ”
48225	48243	48173	48173	Heidi	88	“ Now , are you feeling better ? Want to come join the cool kids ’ table ? ”
48244	48252	48253	48253	I	0	“ Popularity is so overrated , Landon . ”
48271	48335	48336	48336	Heidi	87	“ Come on , cheerleader . Get it moving . Jensen is going to start grilling soon , and you do not want to be over here , standing in his way , when he gets near a grill . Come grab a beer , and hang out with us . We do n’t bite . Well , I ca n’t guarantee Austin . ”
48423	48427	48428	48428	I	0	“ What for ? ”
48450	48470	48432	48432	He	136	“ Did n’t ask . Just said to do it . I ’m grabbing people as they get here . ”
48471	48475	48476	48476	I	0	“ All right , ”
48732	48737	48738	48738	I	0	“ Hey , Matt , ”

48775	48788	48835	48835	him	87	“ Nope . They never tell us anything before they want to . ”
48789	48797	48798	48798	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s the truth . ”
48809	48818	48798	48798	I	0	“ At least they got us some breakfast . ”
48819	48831	48832	48832	I	0	“ I ’m surprised that you eat that kind of thing . ”
48849	48852	48853	48853	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
48856	48874	48853	48853	I	0	“ It ’s all processed flour and high fructose corn syrup . It ’s horrible for you . ”
48880	48884	48875	48875	I	0	“ Tastes delicious . ”
48885	48899	48908	48908	him	87	“ You should take care of your body . You only have one . ”
48900	48903	48904	48904	I	0	“ Noted , ”
48976	48981	48982	48982	Dennis	137	“ Is everyone here ? ”

49029	49034	49035	49035	Dennis	137	“ Right , Jim , ”
49038	49072	49035	49035	Dennis	137	“ Jim is taking a position at the Austin branch . His son just got into Texas , and he and his wife wanted to make the move to be close to him . ”
49176	49213	49214	49214	Dennis	137	“ So , with Jim clearing out his desk next week in the middle of the new city contract work , we ’re going to need to get someone prepped and into his job , pronto . ”
49343	49432	49433	49433	We	1214	“ Company policy says that I have to leave the application up for a minimum of three days . That means you all have until next Wednesday to apply before I close the application entirely . Too much is resting on this project , and we need someone who knows what they ’re doing right away . So , I ’m not going to drag my feet on this . If you do n’t think you can handle it , then do n’t waste my time . Understand ? ”
49440	49457	49433	49433	We	1214	“ Great . Now , get back to work . You ’re wasting time and money . ”
49494	49502	49503	49503	he	111	“ You seem awfully happy about this , ”
49506	49519	49503	49503	he	111	“ Yeah , well , I think it is a great opportunity . ”
49520	49525	49526	49526	He	137	“ You ’re applying ? ”
49531	49541	49526	49526	He	137	“ Um , yeah . Why would n’t I ? ”
49542	49554	49555	49555	I	0	“ You just have n’t been with the company that long . ”
49562	49582	49555	49555	I	0	“ Um … I’ve been with Wright for six years . Have n’t you only been here for four ? ”
49583	49611	49612	49612	he	137	“ Oh , yeah . I guess I forgot that I started after you . I did work for another company for four years before this though , ”
49630	49635	49612	49612	he	137	“ That ’s cool . ”
49721	49726	49727	49727	Matt	111	“ Hey , Heidi , ”
49744	49747	49748	49748	I	0	“ Hmm ? ”
49759	49779	49751	49751	I	0	“ So , I know , the last time we talked , you said that you were dating someone . ”
49790	49793	49751	49751	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
49794	49808	49751	49751	I	0	“ Well , I heard through the grapevine that you ’re single again . ”
49809	49817	49818	49818	He	111	“ There ’s a grapevine for that ? ”
49825	49834	49818	49818	He	111	“ You know that people gossip around here . ”
49835	49839	49751	49751	I	0	“ I see . ”
49840	49872	49873	49873	I	0	“ Well , I was just wondering if you wanted to go out sometime . I ’m free tonight . We could go to Rain Uptown . I love their pasta . ”
49901	49915	49894	49894	I	0	“ Sorry , Matt , but I do n’t date in the office . ”
49916	49919	49920	49920	he	111	“ Oh , ”
49924	49928	49920	49920	he	111	“ I see . ”
49929	49952	49894	49894	I	0	“ It ’s a personal rule . Better not to mix business with pleasure and all that . You understand , right ? ”
49953	49965	49966	49966	he	111	“ Uh , sure . Yeah , it makes perfect sense , ”
51161	51167	51157	51157	his	87	“ Hey ! You showed . ”
51168	51174	51157	51157	his	87	“ I said I would . ”
51175	51194	51201	51201	He	87	“ Yeah , you did , but I was n’t sure . With , well … you know . ”
51364	51368	51369	51369	I	0	“ Nice place , ”
51384	51392	51373	51373	He	87	“ Yeah . Sure . Awesome digs . ”
51393	51401	51402	51402	I	0	“ It ’s not what I expected , ”
51420	51470	51406	51406	He	87	“ I ’m not bitter , I swear , but I went from living in a five - thousand - square - foot house in Clearwater with a pool and Jacuzzi , across from a PGA - regulation golf course , to this . This is … an adjustment . ”
51479	51484	51406	51406	He	87	“ Well , shit . ”
51485	51493	51476	51476	his	87	“ Pretty much my take on it . ”
51494	51514	51406	51406	He	87	“ Why did you pick this place ? It ’s not like you ca n’t live somewhere … better . ”
51515	51560	51406	51406	He	87	“ That ’s true . I could move again if I wanted . But , considering all the other changes in my life , I just wanted to go minimalist . I do n’t need the space . It ’s just me after all . ”
51561	51567	51476	51476	his	87	“ That makes sense actually . ”
51568	51587	51588	51588	Landon	87	“ I think it sounds better in my head than when I said it out loud to Jensen , ”
51597	51610	51591	51591	He	87	“ You want a drink ? Water ? Coke ? A beer ? ”
51611	51618	51619	51619	He	87	“ Coke is fine with me . ”
51708	51728	51729	51729	Landon	87	“ What did Jensen say when you told him you wanted a one - bedroom hole in the wall ? ”
51737	51752	51753	51753	I	0	“ You wound me . It ’s not actually a hole in the wall . ”
51756	51763	51753	51753	I	0	“ It ’s almost comically small . ”
51764	51781	51753	51753	I	0	“ Cut me a break . I did n’t see it before I signed the lease . ”
51782	51790	51753	51753	I	0	“ That was n’t a smart move . ”
51791	51794	51753	51753	I	0	“ Nope , ”
51798	51835	51795	51795	he	87	“ Anyway , Jensen thought I was overreacting to the whole divorce and moving away . That I did n’t need to live in a tree house to get that far away from my normal lifestyle . ”
51836	51842	51843	51843	I	0	“ He ’s not wrong , ”
51847	51863	51843	51843	I	0	“ He ’s not . But I ’m not living in a tree house either . ”
51878	51889	51864	51864	I	0	“ So , why were n’t you at work today ? ”
51890	51900	51901	51901	he	87	“ Ugh ! You want to talk about work ? ”
51920	51928	51904	51904	He	87	“ When I finally have you here ? ”
51929	51932	51933	51933	I	0	“ Finally ? ”
51940	51952	51933	51933	I	0	“ I ’ve never been invited to your tree house before . ”
51953	51975	51976	51976	His	87	“ I did n’t know that all I needed to do was send you an invite to get you over here . ”
52049	52061	52062	52062	I	0	“ I ’m not sure just any invite would have worked , ”
52108	52114	52115	52115	He	87	“ How about this one ? ”
52311	52316	52317	52317	I	0	“ Oh , fuck , ”
52321	52328	52317	52317	I	0	“ Fuck , shit , fuck . ”
52329	52336	52337	52337	he	87	“ Heidi , what ’s wrong ? ”
52363	52370	52357	52357	I	0	“ Stay . Stay right there . ”
52377	52380	52371	52371	His	87	“ Why ? ”
52381	52391	52371	52371	His	87	“ Because this only ends one way , Landon . ”
52392	52404	52371	52371	His	87	“ Hopefully , with you in my fucking bed , Heidi . ”
52405	52413	52371	52371	His	87	“ That is not going to happen ! ”
52414	52421	52422	52422	he	87	“ And why the fuck not ? ”
52425	52450	52422	52422	he	87	“ If the only reason I ’m here right now is because you want to fuck me , then I ’m going to leave , ”
52480	52490	52469	52469	Landon	87	“ No fucking way are you leaving right now . ”
52491	52495	52496	52496	Landon	87	“ Watch me ! ”
52502	52508	52498	52498	his	87	“ You ’re not leaving . ”
52509	52541	52498	52498	his	87	“ You ’re sadly mistaken if you think that , by inviting me to your tiny tree house , I ’ll give up all my reasons for staying away from you . ”
52600	52662	52590	52590	I	0	“ That ’s not what I think . I think you came over to talk to me about why I ’d missed work . Then , you looked at my mouth and licked your lips , and I could n’t sit next to you and lie to myself about wanting you . I ca n’t do what you ’re capable of . ”
52663	52684	52693	52693	he	1275	“ Yes , I want you . But I ca n’t have you . That ’s it . Full stop . ”
52685	52692	52693	52693	he	1275	“ I do n’t accept that , ”
52697	52701	52693	52693	he	1275	“ Learn to . ”
52702	52743	52693	52693	he	1275	“ Are you just blind ? Is that what this is ? Do you think you can really avoid this forever ? Because I ’m not going anywhere , and what we have is n’t just going to go away . ”
52744	52752	52753	52753	I	0	“ What do we have , Landon ? ”
52758	52785	52753	52753	I	0	“ Some phone calls , a New Year ’s mistake , and two whole kisses ? That ’s not much as far as I ’m concerned . ”
52786	52793	52794	52794	His	1275	“ You ’re joking , right ? ”
52804	52867	52868	52868	he	1275	“ We ’ve been friends for , like , fifteen years , Heidi . You ’ve helped me more than you could possibly know during the last year . The only reason I stopped talking to you was because I was so into you , and I knew that I had to put distance between us . But let me be clear , ”
52877	52887	52868	52868	he	1275	“ there is no distance between us any longer . ”
52888	52894	52895	52895	I	0	“ Maybe there should be , ”
52986	53018	52980	52980	my	0	“ No , you ’re wrong . You are fighting this because of work . But I was yours before that , and I ’ll be yours after it , too . ”
53019	53046	53047	53047	I	0	“ That does n’t change the fact that you ’re my boss though . Fuck , I do n’t even know why you ’re my boss , ”
53050	53060	53047	53047	I	0	“ Well , you refused to listen to me . ”
53075	53107	53061	53061	I	0	“ I ’m listening now . I came here to listen to you . For you to tell me why you ’d missed work . Not for you to kiss me ! ”
53167	53172	53173	53173	he	87	“ Okay , Heidi , ”
53196	53210	53177	53177	He	87	“ We ’ll play it your way . I wo n’t kiss you . ”
53225	53234	53235	53235	He	87	“ Then … we’re not doing anything wrong . ”
53279	53285	53286	53286	I	0	“ This is n’t helping , ”
53292	53304	53305	53305	he	87	“ You mean … even when I ’m not kissing you , ”
53323	53332	53305	53305	he	87	“ even when I ’m not touching you … ”
53377	53395	53396	53396	I	0	“ You still have feelings for me ? You still want me ? You still want this ? ”
53407	53436	53396	53396	I	0	“ Because , if you still want me , then it ’s not going to go away . It ’s just going to build . Until it explodes . ”
53447	53459	53460	53460	he	87	“ Tell me you want this as much as I do , ”
53465	53499	53460	53460	he	87	“ Tell me this is n’t a lost cause . I can see you do n’t want me to stop . Just tell me you want this . Stop telling me to stop . ”
53510	53515	53506	53506	I	0	“ Do n’t stop . ”
53936	53939	53940	53940	she	1277	“ Oh , ”
53944	53947	53940	53940	she	1277	“ What ? ”
53993	54001	54002	54002	she	1277	“ You should always walk around shirtless , ”
54017	54021	54002	54002	she	1277	“ Duly noted . ”
54022	54031	54032	54032	She	1277	“ Might be an issue at the office . ”
54050	54059	54045	54045	she	1277	“ I ’m willing to take the risk . ”
54060	54068	54069	54069	My	0	“ I ’ll risk everything for you . ”
54223	54226	54227	54227	she	1277	“ Landon , ”
54430	54433	54434	54434	I	0	“ Heidi , ”
54442	54447	54434	54434	I	0	“ I want you . ”
54448	54451	54434	54434	I	0	“ Yes . ”
54452	54459	54434	54434	I	0	“ I want all of you . ”
54460	54463	54434	54434	I	0	“ Please . ”
54464	54471	54472	54472	I	0	“ No going back from here , ”
54491	54496	54483	54483	I	0	“ Oh , fuck ! ”
54561	54564	54565	54565	she	1277	“ Landon , ”
54568	54572	54565	54565	she	1277	“ oh God . ”
54583	54590	54573	54573	I	0	“ Was this what you wanted ? ”
54591	54596	54573	54573	I	0	“ God , yes . ”
54597	54608	54609	54609	She	1277	“ Where did all of that anger go , firecracker ? ”
54652	54662	54663	54663	I	0	“ Nothing to be mad at me about now ? ”
54668	54676	54677	54677	she	1277	“ Landon , so help me God , ”
54768	54774	54775	54775	she	1277	“ That was … fuck , ”
54782	54789	54775	54775	she	1277	“ That was just the appetizer . ”
54819	54824	54825	54825	I	0	“ Is this okay ? ”
54886	54894	54883	54883	she	1277	“ This is way more than okay . ”
54901	54919	54895	54895	I	0	“ Good . That was what I thought your screams meant , but I was n’t sure . ”
54920	54923	54941	54941	her	1277	“ Fucker . ”
54924	54928	54929	54929	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
54948	54957	54945	54945	she	1277	“ I said , you ’re a fucker . ”
54972	54977	54958	54958	I	0	“ What was that ? ”
54978	54981	54984	54984	she	1277	“ More , ”
55317	55322	55323	55323	I	0	“ Oh , Heidi , ”
55339	55347	55335	55335	She	1277	“ I ca n’t feel my legs . ”
55348	55354	55323	55323	I	0	“ Am I crushing you ? ”
55355	55364	55335	55335	She	1277	“ No , I think you killed me . ”
55365	55371	55372	55372	I	0	“ In a good way ? ”
55378	55384	55372	55372	I	0	“ In the best way . ”
55421	55427	55428	55428	she	1277	“ Watch it , fucker , ”
55435	55444	55428	55428	she	1277	“ Yes , I did just fuck her . ”
55516	55529	55530	55530	I	0	“ I can not believe I just had sex with my boss . ”
55538	55559	55530	55530	I	0	“ You and your titles . I think you just had sex with me . The rest does n’t matter . ”
55560	55563	55590	55590	she	1277	“ Maybe . ”
55564	55575	55576	55576	I	0	“ Are you going to be all right with this ? ”
55597	55615	55590	55590	she	1277	“ Are you kidding ? All right ? We should have done this a long time ago . ”
55623	55635	55616	55616	I	0	“ That ’s what I ’ve been trying to tell you . ”
55636	55649	55650	55650	she	1277	“ That was a really fun way of avoiding my questions earlier , ”
55663	55688	55650	55650	she	1277	“ Oh , Heidi , that was not to avoid anything . That was for fun , and frankly , it was long overdue . ”
55689	55692	55693	55693	she	1277	“ Mmm , ”
55737	55749	55723	55723	she	1277	“ So , why were you out of work today then ? ”
55750	55755	55701	55701	her	1277	“ Doctor ’s appointment . ”
55756	55761	55701	55701	her	1277	“ For your back ? ”
55762	55765	55723	55723	she	1277	“ Yeah . ”
55766	55777	55778	55778	I	0	“ Are you going to tell me the whole story ? ”
55784	55852	55778	55778	I	0	“ Yeah . So , I went pro right out of college and qualified for the PGA my first year out . It was a pretty big deal . I mean , I know you followed some of it , but they thought , in a few years , I would be a shoo - in for a Masters win and maybe even the whole FedEx Cup . ”
55853	55870	55723	55723	she	1277	“ I remember some of that . It was right when I started working for Wright . ”
55871	55914	55946	55946	Her	1295	“ Yeah . So , about two years into my career , I fucked up my back . All the doctors said there was no way I could play on it . I needed to drop out and go on medical exemption . ”
55915	55921	55778	55778	I	0	“ But you did n’t . ”
55922	55945	55946	55946	Her	1295	“ Nope . I played through the pain . Got doped up on pain meds the doctor prescribed and pushed through it . ”
55957	55963	55946	55946	Her	1295	“ That stuff is super addicting ”
55964	55970	55946	55946	Her	1295	“ I ’m well aware . ”
55971	55978	55979	55979	she	1295	“ Did you keep taking them ? ”
55986	55993	55982	55982	her	1295	“ Are you taking them now ? ”
56018	56021	56022	56022	I	0	“ No , ”
56026	56073	56022	56022	I	0	“ It was a stupid mistake to keep going when I should have taken a break . I was so high on the game . I stopped taking the prescriptions and tried to heal in the off season . And I have n’t taken it since . ”
56074	56077	56078	56078	she	1295	“ Never ? ”
56081	56089	56078	56078	she	1295	“ Nope . Not worth the risk . ”
56098	56101	56090	56090	She	1295	“ Good . ”
56102	56193	56022	56022	I	0	“ Anyway , fast forward three years . Something else tweaked in my back , but my doctor gave me the all clear after a couple of weeks . But this summer was the worst . I over rotated . I think I must have put all the pressure into my lower back , and that ’s when it was all over . The doctor said I needed surgery and a minimum of a year recovery , and even then , I might never golf again , ending my career . ”
56194	56199	56200	56200	she	1295	“ Oh my God , ”
56218	56236	56200	56200	she	1295	“ So … you’re working for Wright because you do n’t think you ’ll ever golf again ? ”
56237	56302	56022	56022	I	0	“ I have hope that I will be able to golf again , but I ’m working for Wright while I ’m in physical therapy to try to keep my mind from going crazy . I need something to focus on and something to believe in or else I worry that the mental part of my game will disintegrate if … when I return . ”
56303	56306	56307	56307	she	1295	“ Shit , ”
56310	56317	56307	56307	she	1295	“ That ’s just … awful . ”
56318	56324	56325	56325	I	0	“ What ’s worse is , ”
56331	56381	56325	56325	I	0	“ when I got the news , instead of responding as you just did … as most normal human beings would , Miranda told me I could n’t risk ending my career because of a little pain . I think her exact words were , ‘ Fuck integrity . ’ ”
56385	56389	56382	56382	Heidi	87	“ How awful . ”
56390	56453	56325	56325	I	0	“ Yeah . Then I caught her telling one of her friends that she did n’t want to have kids after we spent the last year in marriage counseling after she miscarried . I ’d been planning to divorce her before she got pregnant , but I tried to make it work . Then it was just a slap in the face . ”
56454	56457	56458	56458	Heidi	87	“ Wow , ”
56461	56469	56458	56458	Heidi	87	“ Was that right before the reunion ? ”
56473	56502	56470	56470	I	0	“ That ’s when I left her . She ’d used up her last chance with me , and I was done . Then , there you were . ”
56512	56582	56503	56503	I	0	“ My little firecracker . And I realized how stressful my life had become and how much I was hurting emotionally , mentally , and physically . But you and I had always been right . We had always been open and honest with each other . Our connection ran deep . And , suddenly , everything in the world made sense . I wanted you and only you . ”
56778	56781	56764	56764	Landon	87	“ Morning . ”
56782	56786	56787	56787	I	0	“ Good morning , ”
56796	56804	56805	56805	I	0	“ You look gorgeous in the morning . ”
56808	56815	56805	56805	I	0	“ Uh , yeah . Sure . ”
56816	56825	56840	56840	he	87	“ Most beautiful thing I ’ve ever seen . ”
56826	56831	56840	56840	he	87	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
56832	56835	56836	56836	he	87	“ Mmm , ”
56862	56865	56849	56849	He	87	“ Shit . ”
56866	56869	56870	56870	I	0	“ What ? ”

57274	57281	57266	57266	he	87	“ Because I was totally involved . ”

57919	57939	57940	57940	Emery	80	“ Nope . I remembered girls ’ night . Just going to get into something a little more comfortable . ”
57952	57960	57940	57940	Emery	80	“ Why are you wearing work clothes ? ”
57961	57968	57902	57902	Emery	80	“ That ’s an excellent question . ”
57969	57977	57940	57940	Emery	80	“ Actually , where were you anyway ? ”
57978	57984	57940	57940	Emery	80	“ Also a good question . ”
58037	58043	58028	58028	her	80	“ Avoiding the questions much ? ”
58044	58047	58048	58048	I	0	“ No , ”
58052	58059	58060	58060	She	80	“ You got another letter today . ”
58092	58095	58096	58096	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
58114	58120	58111	58111	Emery	80	“ Are you going to … ”
58121	58124	58125	58125	I	0	“ No , ”
58134	58139	58125	58125	I	0	“ I ’m not . ”

58180	58185	58186	58186	I	0	“ Okay , okay , ”
58196	58203	58186	58186	I	0	“ I was … with Landon . ”
58204	58209	58210	58210	she	80	“ I KNEW IT ! ”
58235	58244	58229	58229	I	0	“ I did n’t even say anything else . ”
58245	58279	58280	58280	Emery	80	“ Well , you ’re finally fucking admitting to me that you ’re into Landon . I ’ve been waiting for this for months . So , are you like together , together ? ”
58283	58314	58280	58280	Emery	80	“ Emery , I do not understand you . Why are you so excited about this ? You dated Landon for two years . I was terrified of telling you . ”
58326	58411	58315	58315	Emery	80	“ Besides the fact that I ’m dating his brother ? I think I got over my anger at the Wrights because of Jensen . We were kids , Heidi . Landon left me because he thought he was doing the right thing by his dad . I did n’t understand that at the time , but ten years gives you a lot of perspective . I do not begrudge you dating him , like I might have right after high school or something . ”
58412	58432	58280	58280	Emery	80	“ I guess that makes sense . I mean … I still feel weird , telling you about it . ”
58433	58441	58442	58442	she	1315	“ You have n’t told me anything , ”
58456	58474	58442	58442	she	1315	“ Tell me all the details . I think we need ice cream and bubbles to celebrate . ”
58475	58482	58483	58483	I	0	“ Oh , champs , yes ! ”
58486	58489	58490	58490	Emery	80	“ Champs ? ”
58493	58527	58528	58528	I	0	“ You are so Real Housewives right now . Oh my God , I hate myself for knowing that . Damn Morgan and her obsession with those kinds of shows and trash magazines . ”
58531	58543	58528	58528	I	0	“ Does she still watch just to make fun of people ? ”
58544	58570	58619	58619	her	1318	“ Yes , though I think she ’s secretly obsessed . Anyway , enough about Morgan . Tell me about Landon . You ’re together ? ”
58571	58593	58619	58619	her	1318	“ Yes . Well , no . I mean , not technically since he ’s in the middle of a divorce . ”
58594	58602	58528	58528	I	0	“ Oh , thank fuck about Miranda . ”
58603	58616	58617	58617	I	0	“ And there ’s the whole issue with him being my boss , ”
58621	58636	58637	58637	She	1318	“ Oh , right . You have that no - dating - coworkers thing . ”
58668	58694	58653	58653	I	0	“ Julia said that I ’d probably get moved if something happened since he ’s a Wright . But do not say anything to Jensen . ”
58695	58700	58701	58701	Emery	80	“ Ugh , seriously ? ”
58710	58745	58701	58701	Emery	80	“ I do n’t want Jensen to know . We ’ll get in trouble , and I think I ’m in line for a promotion . I ’ve worked so hard for this job . ”
58746	58749	58750	58750	Emery	80	“ Okay , ”
58753	58771	58750	58750	Emery	80	“ I understand that . You got yourself where you are today . But what about Landon ? ”
58772	58785	58786	58786	I	0	“ If he wanted to move … he would have asked already , ”
58792	58807	58786	58786	I	0	“ So , you ’re going to wait for him to make the move ? ”
58808	58816	58817	58817	Emery	80	“ I ’m not jeopardizing my career . ”
58820	58845	58817	58817	Emery	80	“ I ’m not saying to . I ’m saying , if it bothers you this much , then talk to him about it . ”
58846	58905	58786	58786	I	0	“ I have . He knows how I feel about him being my boss , but he got this job for a reason . I do n’t know what to do . I do n’t want to tell him to get a new job when our relationship is just starting , and he ’s going through so much . ”
58906	58925	58786	58786	I	0	“ Well , if it get serious , then you ’re going to have to talk about it . ”
58926	58929	58930	58930	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
59013	59016	59017	59017	Emery	80	“ Sorry , ”
59020	59033	59017	59017	Emery	80	“ I want you to be happy . Landon makes you happy ? ”
59037	59040	59017	59017	Emery	80	“ Very . ”
59041	59052	59017	59017	Emery	80	“ Good . Even if it is a little weird . ”
59053	59058	59059	59059	I	0	“ I knew it ! ”
59062	59070	59071	59071	Emery	80	“ I knew you were weirded out . ”
59077	59097	59071	59071	Emery	80	“ Nah . I ’m joking . Now , the really important question . Mean Girls or Bad Moms ? ”
59098	59107	59071	59071	Emery	80	“ I ’m going to go with both . ”
59108	59112	59071	59071	Emery	80	“ Good choice . ”
59257	59266	59248	59248	he	87	“ You ’re worried about being out together ? ”
59267	59273	59274	59274	I	0	“ I mean … yeah , ”
59277	59284	59274	59274	I	0	“ You ’re still my boss . ”
59285	59289	59290	59290	My	0	“ I know . ”
59297	59311	59290	59290	My	0	“ Could n’t you just … ask Jensen or Morgan to move you ? ”
59317	59322	59312	59312	Landon	87	“ I did already . ”
59323	59326	59327	59327	I	0	“ What ? ”
59330	59350	59327	59327	I	0	“ Yeah . The first day I saw you , I went to ask Morgan for a different job . ”
59351	59358	59312	59312	Landon	87	“ I did n’t know that ! ”
59359	59383	59312	59312	Landon	87	“ Well , I did n’t want you to think that I was out of line when you were still angry with me . ”
59384	59390	59391	59391	Landon	87	“ What did Morgan say ? ”
59394	59441	59391	59391	Landon	87	“ She had to restructure the company to get me into this position . There is no other position for me right now . Nothing I ’m qualified for at least . The job that I have is it for me until something else opens up . ”
59451	59454	59442	59442	I	0	“ Wow . ”
59455	59461	59492	59492	his	87	“ Yeah , I know . ”

60157	60171	60135	60135	She	77	“ Do we have to talk about that silly document you sent me ? ”
60176	60197	60198	60198	She	77	“ I ’m at work . Either you ’re here to sign the paperwork or you ’re going to leave . ”

60781	60818	60774	60774	I	0	“ I have never cheated on you . And I ca n’t currently be cheating on you because we ’re separated . And , if you ’d just sign the paperwork , we ’d be divorced . ”

60829	60851	60852	60852	I	0	“ This conversation has no purpose . If you ’re here to annoy me , then congratulations . You ’ve succeeded . ”

61408	61432	61433	61433	she	77	“ Same , Miranda . What are you doing here ? Just took a wrong turn and ended up in Lubbock , huh ? ”
61445	61463	61433	61433	she	77	“ I ’m here to see my husband . You do n’t have to be so patronizing . ”
61464	61473	61474	61474	Morgan	85	“ Oh , big words . So adorable , ”
61483	61486	61474	61474	Morgan	85	“ Morgan . ”
61487	61500	61501	61501	Miranda	77	“ Are you going to let her talk to me like this ? ”
61508	61518	61519	61519	I	0	“ You think I have any control over her ? ”
61522	61527	61528	61528	Morgan	85	“ He does n’t , ”
61531	61541	61542	61542	Morgan	85	“ How did you even know she was here ? ”
61545	61550	61551	61551	She	85	“ Gossip travels quick . ”
61557	61568	61551	61551	She	85	“ Ready to go home now ? Buh - bye ! ”
61569	61577	61578	61578	Morgan	85	“ You ca n’t make me leave . ”
61593	61667	61578	61578	Morgan	85	“ Hmm … last I checked … I was the vice president of this company . That kind of makes me … in charge around here . I know that must be hard for you to comprehend since you do n’t have a job . Your idea of work is being a stay - at - home wife , which means spending all of my brother ’s money and generally being a bimbo . ”
61668	61674	61750	61750	she	85	“ Fuck you , Morgan . ”
61675	61689	61690	61690	I	0	“ So , as you can see , I can make you leave . ”
61718	61735	61736	61736	I	0	“ It ’s okay . She ’s going to go . Are n’t you , Miranda ? ”
61739	61744	61745	61745	she	85	“ What about dinner ? ”
61814	61821	61830	61830	Miranda	77	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
61822	61829	61830	61830	Miranda	77	“ Do n’t think about anything , ”
61838	61843	61833	61833	She	77	“ Just text me . ”
61844	61853	61854	61854	Morgan	85	“ It ’s time for you to go ! ”
61857	61880	61881	61881	Miranda	77	“ You ’re trespassing on private property , and if you do n’t get out of here , I ’ll call security . ”
61888	61897	61881	61881	Miranda	77	“ You ’re such a bitch , Morgan . ”
61898	61903	61904	61904	Morgan	85	“ Fine by me ! ”
61908	61913	61904	61904	Morgan	85	“ Now , out ! ”
61984	61996	61997	61997	Morgan	85	“ You are not seriously considering going to dinner with her ? ”
62004	62022	62023	62023	I	0	“ What the hell did she say before I showed up that would make you consider that ? ”
62040	62052	62053	62053	She	85	“ Oh my God , you ’re not getting back together . ”
62061	62083	62053	62053	She	85	“ Please , for the love of all things holy , tell me you are not getting back together with her ! ”
62084	62095	62096	62096	I	0	“ We ’re not getting back together . Calm down , ”
62102	62148	62096	62096	I	0	“ Oh , thank God . I thought I was going to have to stage an intervention . I would get the entire family together . We ’d meet at Jensen ’s place . It would probably involve a PowerPoint presentation and lots of whiskey . ”
62165	62178	62161	62161	I	0	“ I get it . No one in the family likes her . ”
62179	62182	62053	62053	She	85	“ Understatement . ”
62183	62200	62161	62161	I	0	“ And you ’re all thrilled that my marriage is dissolving , and we ’re divorcing . ”
62201	62204	62161	62161	I	0	“ Very . ”
62205	62221	62161	62161	I	0	“ And you do n’t care how it happens as long as it ’s done . ”
62222	62267	62161	62161	I	0	“ Well , more or less . I mean , I want you to be happy . And I ’m certain you ’ll come out of this happier than you were before . I do n’t know how you lived with her this long . ”
62268	62281	62161	62161	I	0	“ You know , she was n’t always like that with me . ”
62282	62293	62294	62294	Morgan	85	“ Or you were just banging and did n’t care . ”
62302	62307	62308	62308	I	0	“ Horrible mental image . ”
62311	62329	62308	62308	I	0	“ You ’re a riot , Morgan . Now , really , what are you doing here ? ”
62330	62376	62161	62161	I	0	“ Hello ? I saved your ass . I heard — and I quote—‘Landon ’s hot wife is here . ’ So , I ran as soon as I could to take care of it . You ’re a softy . Like this dinner thing … ”
62377	62398	62399	62399	Morgan	85	“ Look , she promised she ’d sign the divorce papers if I went to one more dinner with her . ”
62402	62408	62399	62399	Morgan	85	“ She ’ll sign anyway . ”
62409	62415	62161	62161	I	0	“ She has n’t yet . ”
62416	62435	62161	62161	I	0	“ We ’re not in dire straits here . She ’s going to sign . She has to . ”
62436	62446	62161	62161	I	0	“ I ’d like her to do it today . ”
62447	62465	62161	62161	I	0	“ And do you think going to dinner with her will somehow miraculously make her do that ? ”
62466	62494	62495	62495	I	0	“ I do n’t know , but if it will , is n’t it worth pursuing ? I will do anything to make her do this faster , ”
62502	62519	62499	62499	Morgan	85	“ Do n’t say anything . You do n’t know what she ’ll come up with . ”
62520	62536	62161	62161	I	0	“ I ’ll think about it . I do n’t know what I ’ll do . ”
62537	62554	62555	62555	I	0	“ Please do not do anything stupid . There ’s still time to stage that intervention . ”
62564	62593	62555	62555	I	0	“ You ’ve done enough for me , Morgan . The divorce will be finalized soon , and then we can all move on from this train wreck . ”
62594	62602	62603	62603	she	85	“ I wo n’t hold my breath , ”
62606	62613	62603	62603	she	85	“ Always a ray of sunshine . ”
62614	62640	62641	62641	I	0	“ I run a business . I do n’t need to be a fucking ray of sunshine . I just need to get shit done . ”
62649	62662	62641	62641	I	0	“ If only we were all as amazing as you , Morgan . ”
62663	62672	62673	62673	I	0	“ Do n’t do anything stupid , okay ? ”
62679	62684	62673	62673	I	0	“ Do I ever ? ”
62685	62703	62704	62704	She	85	“ All the time . You and Austin . You ’re going to give me gray hair . ”
62717	62747	62704	62704	She	85	“ If you ’re going to do something stupid , then do n’t blame me when it backfires in your face , okay ? I ’m warning you now . ”
62748	62752	62753	62753	I	0	“ Warning noted . ”
63053	63058	63041	63045	one of the other engineers	1360	“ Hey , Landon ! ”
63099	63104	63105	63105	I	0	“ Hey , man , ”
63112	63118	63105	63105	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
63119	63124	63125	63125	he	961	“ It ’s Matt , ”
63131	63143	63125	63125	he	961	“ Right . Matt . What can I do for you ? ”
63144	63156	63157	63157	Matt	111	“ I wanted to give you a high five , man , ”
63203	63207	63217	63217	Matt	111	“ What for ? ”
63208	63216	63217	63217	Matt	111	“ You have a really hot wife ! ”
63249	63270	63236	63236	she	1369	“ I mean , they do n’t make them like that around here , if you know what I mean . ”
63304	63329	63330	63330	Matt	111	“ You should remember who you ’re speaking with . I wo n’t condone people degrading women in such a manner in my office . ”
63333	63357	63330	63330	Matt	111	“ Uh , yeah , totally . Sorry . I did n’t mean anything by it . I thought it was a compliment . ”
63358	63365	63366	63366	Matt	111	“ That ’s what concerns me . ”
63375	63380	63366	63366	Matt	111	“ I , uh … ”
63381	63398	63330	63330	Matt	111	“ Do n’t worry about it . Just try to be more respectful in the future . ”
63418	63424	63411	63411	She	1370	“ Can I help you ? ”
63425	63443	63330	63330	Matt	111	“ Yes . As a matter of fact , I need to see you in my office . ”
63444	63451	63456	63456	her	1370	“ Did I do something wrong ? ”
63461	63490	63456	63456	her	1370	“ On the contrary , I wanted to discuss Jim ’s old job . I ’ll be talking with everyone throughout the week , regarding the new position . ”
63491	63495	63496	63496	She	1370	“ I see . ”
63517	63521	63514	63514	her	1370	“ After you . ”
63575	63581	63582	63582	Heidi	87	“ That was … interesting , ”
63585	63590	63582	63582	Heidi	87	“ More like outrageous . ”
63591	63599	63613	63613	She	1370	“ Which part ? Morgan or Miranda ? ”
63600	63603	63604	63604	I	0	“ Yes , ”
63630	63644	63613	63613	She	1370	“ I ’m guessing I ’m not here to discuss the new job . ”
63645	63649	63650	63650	I	0	“ Not exactly , ”
63653	63673	63650	63650	I	0	“ I figured . So … Miranda is back . What does that mean ? Are you back together ? ”
63674	63683	63613	63613	She	1370	“ Did you not hear the shouting match ? ”
63684	63702	63613	63613	She	1370	“ I heard Morgan bossing Miranda around . I do n’t know where you stand on her . ”
63703	63724	63613	63613	She	1370	“ Same place I ’ve stood with her since the reunion . I ’m leaving her . It ’s over . ”
63725	63733	63734	63734	Heidi	87	“ But she does n’t want that ? ”
63781	63803	63777	63777	she	1373	“ Hey , this still does n’t change anything between us . That ’s why I wanted to talk to you . ”
63804	63817	63818	63818	She	1373	“ So , you ’re not going to dinner with her then ? ”
63830	63845	63818	63818	She	1373	“ I do n’t know . I wanted to talk to you about that . ”
63846	63854	63855	63855	She	1373	“ What ’s there to talk about ? ”
63863	63870	63855	63855	She	1373	“ You clearly want to go . ”
63871	63909	63818	63818	She	1373	“ Hold up . I clearly do not want to go , but she said , if I went , she ’d sign the divorce papers . That seems like a good thing for me and you . ”
63910	63914	63915	63915	she	1373	“ Just dinner ? ”
63919	63926	63915	63915	she	1373	“ That ’s what she said . ”
63927	63930	63818	63818	She	1373	“ Yep . ”
63931	63938	63818	63818	She	1373	“ And do you believe her ? ”
63939	63945	63946	63946	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
63951	63963	63946	63946	I	0	“ What do you think ? Is it worth a shot ? ”
63964	63974	63975	63975	Heidi	87	“ Honestly , it sounds like a horrible idea , ”
63978	63989	63975	63975	Heidi	87	“ Then , I wo n’t go . Easy enough . ”
63990	63993	63994	63994	she	1373	“ But , ”
64010	64031	64003	64003	she	1373	“ I do want it to be over , Landon . I hate hiding . I hate all of this . ”
64039	64043	64035	64035	her	1373	“ It sucks . ”
64076	64100	64101	64101	My	0	“ Me , too , Heidi . You know I hate this as well . I do n’t even want to hide you . ”

64126	64132	64123	64123	she	1373	“ We ’re at work ! ”
64133	64149	64186	64186	her	1373	“ I know . I ’m sorry . I ca n’t help it around you . ”
64150	64178	64186	64186	her	1373	“ You are my boss . I am your employee . There is a line we ’re not supposed to cross , and you keep hurdling it . ”
64179	64183	64184	64184	She	1373	“ With pleasure . ”
64189	64225	64184	64184	She	1373	“ I hate the idea of you spending any time with Miranda . She ’s unpredictable , which makes her a liability . However , if you think you can make headway , then go . ”
64226	64229	64186	64186	her	1373	“ Heidi — ”
64230	64250	64251	64251	I	0	“ I ’ll be fine . I ’ll just … go hang out with Em . She ’ll understand . ”
64324	64342	64343	64343	Heidi	87	“ I ’m not going . Not if you ’re hurting half as much as Emery was . ”
64346	64362	64363	64363	she	1375	“ No , I did n’t mean that with you . I meant , Vanessa , ”
64373	64403	64363	64363	she	1375	“ Em goes to see Colton every month and has to deal with her . She can commiserate . Seriously … just go , but do n’t enjoy it . ”
64435	64456	64457	64457	She	1375	“ I could never enjoy a single moment spent with her … when I could be spending it with you . ”
64467	64480	64457	64457	She	1375	“ Good . Now , make the bitch sign the damn paperwork . ”
64484	64487	64481	64481	I	0	“ Deal . ”

64670	64676	64677	64677	Austin	78	“ Not a good idea , ”
64680	64691	64677	64677	Austin	78	“ What would you know about good decisions regarding relationships ? ”
64698	64712	64692	64692	I	0	“ Either of you actually . Have you ever had a serious girlfriend ? ”
64713	64722	64723	64723	Patrick	101	“ Oh , there was that one time , ”

64808	64816	64817	64817	I	0	“ Could you keep your voice down ? ”
64840	64870	64871	64871	I	0	“ And Miranda has a way of fucking you over , dude . I mean , you had to marry her before you realized she was a massive bitch . ”
64911	64929	64930	64930	I	0	“ Appreciate the concern , guys , but she ’s signing the paperwork . That ’s it , ”

65786	65799	65778	65778	Her	77	“ Just … let it be like old times for one night . ”
65883	65886	65887	65887	Miranda	77	“ So , ”

65980	65985	65972	65972	I	0	“ Um … no . ”
65986	66017	65942	65942	she	77	“ Well , that ’s why you ’re divorcing me , right ? Because I lost the first one and then jokingly said that I did n’t want any kids . ”
66018	66023	65942	65942	she	77	“ That ’s not — ”
66024	66033	66034	66034	she	77	“ God , I get it , Landon , ”
66037	66087	66034	66034	she	77	“ I mean , I understand where you ’re coming from . You want a big family . You come from a big family . I did n’t think it was that serious . I did n’t think you ’d want to walk away just because I was scared . ”
66088	66097	66098	66098	Her	77	“ That is not what I ’m doing . ”
66103	66161	66098	66098	Her	77	“ Then , let ’s figure this out . I know I ’ve been moody the last year . I know I have n’t been my best me with you , but that does n’t mean we give up . We can try harder . We can try for another baby . Just … don’t leave me . ”
66162	66173	66034	66034	she	77	“ Miranda , you can not do this right now . ”
66174	66178	66179	66179	she	77	“ Do what ? ”
66182	66189	66179	66179	she	77	“ Try to save our marriage ? ”
66190	66212	66213	66213	I	0	“ Our marriage is in the process of being dissolved . I ’m here so that you ’ll make it official , ”
66222	66235	66215	66215	her	77	“ The last thing I want is have a baby with you . ”
66236	66262	66179	66179	she	77	“ That is n’t what you said a couple months ago ! You were yelling at me because of some throw away statement I made . ”
66263	66267	66268	66268	I	0	“ Throw away … ”
66279	66301	66268	66268	I	0	“ It ’s more than one statement . This is bigger than that . But I am not changing my mind . ”

66308	66332	66179	66179	she	77	“ How many times do I have to tell you that Emery is with Jensen , and I have no feelings for her ? ”
66333	66350	66268	66268	I	0	“ Another time I guess because I do n’t believe it . It ’s something else . ”
66351	66381	66382	66382	Miranda	77	“ I ca n’t believe I even have to say this because you already know why I ’m divorcing you . But do I need to tell you again ? ”
66403	66420	66399	66399	she	77	“ Fine . Tell me again . Because I think you ’re making a huge mistake . ”
66421	66433	66434	66434	I	0	“ I ’m divorcing you because what we have is broken , ”
66447	66464	66434	66434	I	0	“ We are two different people , and it has taken me years to realize that . ”
66465	66560	66561	66561	I	0	“ This is insane , Landon . I ’ve given you everything . I moved to Tampa for you where I knew absolutely no one . I quit my job for you so that I could support you while you golfed . I gave up holidays with my family in Augusta to be here in this desert wasteland with your family who hates me . I ’ve dealt with golf fans and cling - ons and all of that bullshit . You think I ruined your life , Landon ? Look a little closer . ”
66694	66700	66701	66701	I	0	“ The answer is no , ”
66709	66714	66715	66715	she	1397	“ No to what ? ”

66743	66752	66703	66703	her	1397	“ You ’re not even going to consider ? ”
66753	66766	66703	66703	her	1397	“ I do n’t have to . This is over , Miranda . ”
66767	66775	66776	66776	she	1397	“ Then , I change my terms , ”
66790	66806	66776	66776	she	1397	“ You ca n’t change the terms . You said dinner . That ’s it . ”
66807	66829	66830	66830	I	0	“ Well , if you really think that we ’re never getting back together , then this wo n’t even matter . ”
66847	66850	66838	66838	I	0	“ No . ”
66851	66871	66830	66830	I	0	“ One more thing , and then I ’m out of your life forever … just like you want . ”
66872	66878	66879	66879	She	1397	“ What ? What thing ? ”
66891	66900	66879	66879	She	1397	“ Make love to me one more time . ”
67022	67032	67006	67006	I	0	“ For the good time I ’ll be missing . ”
67038	67041	67033	67033	She	1397	“ Landon ! ”
67042	67048	67049	67049	I	0	“ The answer is no , ”
67055	67077	67049	67049	I	0	“ Actually , the answer is fuck no . I ’d rather see you in court than sit here another minute . ”
67078	67083	67085	67085	I	0	“ Landon , wait ! ”

67784	67789	67772	67772	Heidi	87	“ Time to go . ”
67790	67813	67814	67814	I	0	“ No way ! I have , like … a whole beer here , and I ’m totally slaying Tommy over here . ”
67829	67834	67821	67821	She	1421	“ You were busy . ”

67886	67902	67903	67903	I	0	“ Why do n’t you find another half - naked drunk girl to hit on ? ”
67909	67923	67903	67903	I	0	“ I ’m going to be here , taking care of this one . ”

67955	68022	67948	67948	I	0	“ You ’re right . You do n’t need to be taken care of , but I am going to take care of you anyway . You ca n’t convince me otherwise . And , right now , I would like to put some clothes on you and get you away from every guy in this place who wants to whip his dick out right now . ”

71853	71856	71857	71857	I	0	“ Home , ”
71872	71877	71866	71866	his	87	“ Morning , Em . ”
71878	71883	71884	71884	she	80	“ Oh my God , ”
71895	71917	71884	71884	she	80	“ That was not … I mean — fuck . I ’m just going to — yep , all right then . ”
71929	71932	71926	71926	I	0	“ Ugh ! ”
71940	71947	71933	71933	Landon	87	“ Why are you so embarrassed ? ”
71956	71963	71948	71948	I	0	“ You are such a dude . ”
71964	71969	71970	71970	he	87	“ Hey , hey , ”
71978	71987	71970	71970	he	87	“ She ’s the one dating my brother . ”
72001	72014	72015	72015	He	87	“ And do you want to see her in bed with him ? ”
72021	72030	72018	72018	his	87	“ Yeah , I did n’t think so . ”
72054	72059	72043	72043	I	0	“ Hey , Em ? ”
72060	72064	72065	72065	Emery	80	“ In here , ”
72071	72074	72075	72075	She	80	“ Hey . ”
72092	72097	72080	72080	she	80	“ Sorry about that . ”
72098	72104	72105	72105	she	80	“ It ’s no big , ”
72108	72120	72105	72105	she	80	“ I just … was a hundred percent unprepared for that . ”
72121	72132	72133	72133	Emery	80	“ Yeah , I guess it ’s probably pretty weird . ”
72142	72150	72133	72133	Emery	80	“ That ’s a word for it . ”
72151	72190	72191	72191	Emery	80	“ I know you said that you were cool with it , but I really do n’t want you to feel uncomfortable in your own apartment . We do n’t have to be here if you do n’t — ”
72197	72228	72191	72191	Emery	80	“ Bring it down a level , hooker . I do n’t care that you ’re together , and I do n’t want you to have to go somewhere else . ”
72229	72232	72233	72233	I	0	“ But ? ”
72236	72252	72233	72233	I	0	“ But … I do n’t know how long I can keep this from Jensen . ”
72275	72283	72289	72289	him	87	“ Sorry , just happened to overhear . ”
72291	72300	72286	72286	her	80	“ Yeah , because we ’re so quiet . ”
72301	72316	72317	72317	Emery	80	“ Telling Jensen would be a really bad idea for Heidi at this point . ”
72329	72383	72317	72317	Emery	80	“ I ’m going crazy over here . Secrets are a big thing between me and Jensen , and if he thinks I ’m holding something back , then he ’s going to get pissed . And , trust me , no one likes when that happens . Least of all , me . ”
72384	72399	72400	72400	I	0	“ Yeah , but if we tell Jensen , I could lose my job , ”
72403	72411	72400	72400	I	0	“ Or we could figure something out ! ”
72415	72433	72434	72434	Landon	87	“ I love my brother , but we all know he solves problems with a blunt instrument , ”
72437	72445	72446	72446	Emery	80	“ What if we talked to Morgan ? ”
72449	72453	72446	72446	Emery	80	“ Already did . ”
72454	72457	72458	72458	Emery	80	“ Fuck , ”
72461	72487	72458	72458	Emery	80	“ Okay , okay . I can figure this out , but if he shows up and y’ all are together , I never knew ! ”
72488	72492	72493	72493	Landon	143	“ Got it , ”
72499	72504	72496	72496	I	0	“ Thanks , Em . ”
72505	72510	72511	72511	Emery	80	“ You owe me , ”
72515	72529	72511	72511	Emery	80	“ And you … you should be lucky it ’s my best friend . ”
72536	72553	72554	72554	She	80	“ We both appreciate it , Emery . Even if we do n’t both deserve it . ”
72566	72575	72576	72576	Emery	80	“ I have to get ready for work , ”
72582	72608	72576	72576	Emery	80	“ Will you please be careful ? I could have easily had Jensen with me , and we ’d be having a much different conversation . ”
72609	72622	72556	72556	her	80	“ I ’d like to avoid that conversation if at all possible . ”
72623	72628	72629	72629	she	80	“ Me , too , ”
72640	72658	72632	72632	Emery	80	“ This is so weird . You ’re sleeping with Landon Wright . Like … Landon Wright . ”
72659	72662	72663	72663	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
72672	72676	72663	72663	I	0	“ Guess so . ”
72677	72690	72691	72691	I	0	“ And it ’s the week of … and you seem okay . ”
72695	72710	72691	72691	I	0	“ I ’m holding up . I told him last night … about everything . ”
72711	72730	72731	72731	I	0	“ Holy shit , Heidi . That ’s huge . Y’all are really serious , are n’t you ? ”
72741	72775	72731	72731	I	0	“ I feel like it all happened so fast , yet … I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long . Just finding a guy who really gets me , you know ? ”
72782	72809	72776	72776	Emery	80	“ That , I do . And I ’m also queen of realizing that it ’s not always the guy you expected you ’d fall for . ”
72810	72819	72820	72820	I	0	“ What is it with these Wright brothers ? ”
72823	72829	72820	72820	I	0	“ If only I knew . ”
72830	72833	72776	72776	Emery	80	“ Seriously . ”
72834	72843	72844	72844	Emery	80	“ Falling for them only pads their egos , ”
72852	72860	72847	72847	I	0	“ As if their egos need padding . ”
72861	72867	72776	72776	Emery	80	“ Yet we love them . ”
72868	72872	72873	72873	I	0	“ We do , ”
72880	72901	72877	72877	Emery	80	“ Okay , seriously , work . Go put some clothes on , you slob . You ’re super naked . ”
72922	72931	72915	72915	I	0	“ Whatever . You like it , ho . ”
72932	72944	72945	72945	I	0	“ Oh , yeah , baby . Take it all off . ”
72962	72970	72945	72945	I	0	“ Come and get it , lover . ”
73088	73092	73093	73093	Landon	87	“ She okay ? ”
73103	73110	73096	73096	I	0	“ I think she ’s adjusting . ”
73111	73119	73096	73096	I	0	“ Yeah , welcome to the club . ”
73120	73163	73164	73164	He	87	“ You know what ? Do n’t use that tone with me about Emery . You were the one who ditched her on graduation day and left her in tattered pieces that I had to put back together for years , Landon . ”
73172	73213	73164	73164	He	87	“ Whoa . Okay . I did n’t mean to upset you like that . I meant that I had to adjust to her and Jensen . At least you told her about us before she walked in on us . ”
73214	73218	73219	73219	I	0	“ I know , ”
73228	73243	73219	73219	I	0	“ I get defensive about Emery . You really hurt her , you know . ”
73252	73397	73244	73244	He	1495	“ Yeah . Trust me , I carry around the guilt from it . I was mad about what had happened with my dad , that the last thing I ’d ever said to him was that I chose Emery over him and that I would every time . When he died , I blamed myself , and I stupidly blamed Emery . I could n’t even look at her or think about her or talk to her without that pain . So , yeah , I get that you want to protect her . I was a dick to push her away when I was grieving , but it was high school . I have apologized for how I acted . And what happened with me and Emery has absolutely nothing to do with what ’s happening with me and you , Heidi . ”
73398	73408	73409	73409	I	0	“ That was what you said to your dad ? ”
73413	73418	73419	73419	he	1496	“ Uh … yeah , ”
73425	73433	73419	73419	he	1496	“ Did I never tell you that ? ”
73434	73449	73244	73244	He	1495	“ I … no . I knew you got into an argument about college . ”
73450	73491	73419	73419	he	1496	“ Yeah , well , what I would n’t give to redo those days . But then I do n’t know if I ’d be standing right here , and I know this is where I ’m supposed to be . ”
73521	73529	73530	73530	I	0	“ We should probably get my car , ”
73539	73545	73546	73546	he	1496	“ And get to work , ”
73549	73556	73546	73546	he	1496	“ But there ’s a bed . ”
73571	73578	73565	73565	he	1496	“ And this ass . Fuck . ”
73735	73740	73741	73741	Julia	106	“ There you are ! ”
73750	73760	73741	73741	Julia	106	“ Yeah , sorry about that . Car trouble . ”
73761	73773	73777	73777	his	111	“ Landon must have had the same kind of car trouble , ”
73780	73783	73784	73784	I	0	“ What ? ”
73809	73816	73817	73817	Julia	106	“ Landon is n’t in yet , ”
73821	73833	73834	73834	I	0	“ Really ? Weird . Did he really have car trouble ? ”
73851	73863	73864	73864	I	0	“ We do n’t know . He ’s just not here . ”
73867	73877	73864	73864	I	0	“ Does n’t he have physical therapy or something ? ”
73878	73882	73883	73883	Matt	111	“ For what ? ”
73886	73890	73883	73883	Matt	111	“ Golf injury . ”
73891	73902	73864	73864	I	0	“ How do you know so much about Landon anyway ? ”
73903	73919	73864	73864	I	0	“ Well … we’ve been friends since high school . He dated my best friend . ”
73920	73923	73924	73924	Matt	111	“ Huh , ”
73967	73974	73975	73975	Matt	111	“ I did n’t realize that , ”
73979	73982	73983	73983	Julia	106	“ Anyway , ”
73986	74004	73983	73983	Julia	106	“ we ’re not here to talk about Landon . I ’m here to schedule your interview . ”
74005	74014	74015	74015	I	0	“ My interview for the lead engineer spot ? ”
74026	74033	74015	74015	I	0	“ Yes . That ’s right . ”
74034	74039	74040	74040	Matt	111	“ Congrats , Heidi , ”
74043	74049	74040	74040	Matt	111	“ I scheduled mine yesterday . ”
74066	74078	74064	74064	dude	2534	“ Oh my God , yes . Let ’s do this . ”
74100	74117	74091	74091	She	106	“ Please tell me that you and Landon are not both late because you were together . ”
74118	74129	74130	74130	I	0	“ We ’re not both late because we were together , ”
74134	74141	74132	74132	her	106	“ It looks bad , Heidi . ”
74142	74146	74147	74147	I	0	“ I know , ”
74150	74213	74147	74147	I	0	“ That creep Matt is picking up on things , and I do n’t want him to put the pieces together about you two . I thought you were going to be smart about this . Showing up late , missing work at the same time , hanging out in his office , going to lunch together ? Heidi , come on . ”
74251	74260	74261	74261	I	0	“ I got it . I got it , ”
74277	74302	74264	74264	Julia	106	“ You are a serious contender for this promotion , Heidi . I should n’t even freaking tell you this , but you are . ”
74335	74342	74330	74330	I	0	“ I got it , Julia . ”
74343	74366	74306	74306	her	106	“ Good . Now that that ’s over , let ’s pen you in for Thursday morning at nine o’clock with Dennis . ”
74367	74371	74322	74322	someone	352	“ Sounds good . ”
74372	74395	74396	74396	I	0	“ Now , what are you doing on Saturday ? Because I could desperately use some shopping for the Wright Charity Benefit . ”
74455	74467	74468	74468	She	106	“ Uh … Saturday is n’t good . How about Sunday ? ”
74473	74487	74468	74468	She	106	“ Trevor is dragging me to church with him and his entire family . ”
74488	74497	74470	74470	her	106	“ Oh , you ’re meeting the family ? ”
74498	74517	74470	74470	her	106	“ Yeah . Should be interesting . Unfortunately , they go to the same church as the Wrights . ”
74518	74527	74528	74528	I	0	“ That means … Austin will be there ? ”
74531	74536	74537	74537	I	0	“ Yeah . Dick . ”
74540	74560	74537	74537	I	0	“ Okay . Not Sunday . We ’ll figure it out . Still plenty of time before the Benefit . ”
74561	74585	74586	74586	I	0	“ True . Just let me know if you change your mind about Saturday . I could use some time with my girls ! ”
74670	74674	74665	74665	He	87	“ Good morning . ”
74675	74683	74715	74715	him	87	“ You ’re late , Mr. Wright . ”
74684	74690	74665	74665	He	87	“ Had a busy morning . ”
74691	74707	74708	74708	I	0	“ Me , too . Found out I have an interview for Jim ’s job , ”
74717	74720	74721	74721	he	87	“ Congratulations , ”
74728	74738	74739	74739	I	0	“ And that Matt suspects something is going on , ”
74750	74757	74744	74744	Landon	87	“ Huh . Is that right ? ”
74758	74767	74744	74744	Landon	87	“ Yep . We should be more careful . ”
74768	74781	74782	74782	He	87	“ Duly noted , Miss Martin . Good luck on your interview . ”
74861	74869	74870	74870	Matt	111	“ So , why was he late ? ”
74878	74891	74892	74892	I	0	“ Do n’t know . He said he had a busy morning , ”
74898	74910	74911	74911	he	111	“ Could you imagine if I used that as my excuse ? ”
74914	74922	74911	74911	he	111	“ Well , he ’s the boss . ”
74936	74940	74941	74941	he	111	“ Fucking Wrights , ”
74947	74955	74941	74941	he	111	“ They could get away with murder . ”
75253	75256	75257	75257	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
75265	75271	75257	75257	I	0	“ How are you doing ? ”
75298	75305	75306	75306	Emery	80	“ Ready to face the day . ”
75315	75341	75306	75306	Emery	80	“ You ’re an incredible person , you have a brilliant mind , and you are my best friend . You know that , right ? ”
75345	75348	75342	75342	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
75349	75353	75354	75354	I	0	“ Come here . ”
75370	75377	75364	75364	we	1533	“ I love you , Heidi . ”
75378	75386	75342	75342	I	0	“ Love you , too , Em . ”
75387	75395	75396	75396	I	0	“ Call me if you need me . ”
75538	75543	75526	75526	He	87	“ Morning , gorgeous . ”
75544	75547	75548	75548	I	0	“ Hey , ”
75555	75559	75548	75548	I	0	“ You ready ? ”
75560	75567	75568	75568	I	0	“ As long as you are . ”
75967	75972	75973	75973	I	0	“ Hey , Mom , ”
75976	76009	75973	75973	I	0	“ I , uh … just wanted to stop by and introduce you to Landon . He ’s , uh … a , uh , Wright . You probably knew his dad . ”
76021	76036	76017	76017	he	87	“ He ’s kind of my boyfriend , and I thought you should meet . ”
76037	76054	76055	76055	Landon	87	“ Nice to meet you , Mrs. Martin . You have a real great girl here , ”
76066	76078	76060	76060	he	87	“ So , I ’m kind of your boyfriend , huh ? ”
76079	76084	76017	76017	he	87	“ That ’s right . ”
76085	76103	76017	76017	he	87	“ I ’m looking forward to the day we can get rid of that kind of part . ”
76104	76109	76110	76110	I	0	“ Me , too , ”
76113	76145	76110	76110	I	0	“ You know , few years I ’ll be as old as my mom when she died . It ’s scary to think that I ’ll live longer than she did . ”
76146	76176	76017	76017	he	87	“ I know how that feels . I was only seven when my mom died . I was older than her almost two years ago . It was disorienting . ”
76177	76189	76190	76190	He	1556	“ Do you want to see her while we ’re here ? ”
76195	76219	76190	76190	He	1556	“ How about we do it when I can introduce you to both of them as my girlfriend … not just kind of ? ”
76226	76232	76220	76220	I	0	“ I ’d like that . ”
76233	76243	76244	76244	he	1556	“ What else do you do on this day ? ”
76247	76311	76312	76312	He	1556	“ I usually do all the things that I would have done with my parents before my mom died . It ’s like I get to mourn them both on the same day . It ’s kind of like … I give myself permission to be a kid again . It ’s dumb . I know . I never tell anyone about it . ”
76320	76348	76312	76312	He	1556	“ The way you grieve is never dumb . It is unique to every person . Allowing yourself the time to do it is what ’s important . ”
76509	76549	76550	76550	I	0	“ Dad used to put me on his shoulders when I was kid so that I could reach the high branches in the trees . It was my favorite part , getting to throw apples down to my mom , ”
76561	76644	76554	76554	He	87	“ Sometimes , I would swing back and forth between their arms . We came every year , you know . My mom adored fresh apples . Later , when we got home , she would make me a homemade apple pie . She ’d always remind me to blow on it to cool it down . As a kid , I always wanted to eat the ice cream , but now , I would kill for a slice of her pie . ”
76645	76655	76656	76656	he	87	“ Let ’s make one when we get back , ”
76664	76681	76659	76659	I	0	“ No , I do n’t have her recipe . It ’s different . I tried . ”
76682	76688	76689	76689	he	87	“ All right , love , ”
76698	76705	76706	76706	I	0	“ Ready for our next stop ? ”

When he did n’t do drugs , then sell drugs , then fucking bankroll the bar with his drug money to try to keep it afloat . I wished he had n’t been the kind of dad who brought strange women over all the time . Married women . The kind who I never really knew their names , and they switched too often for me to care . I wished I had n’t had to clean up his fucking messes all the time . Help him in his drunken stupor and cry myself to sleep when he was in a drunken rage so bad that only passing out would get him to stop . “

84873	84880	84881	84881	Landon	87	“ Heidi is n’t a replacement , ”
84890	84905	84887	84887	his	87	“ Heidi is … her own person . She ’s not a real PGA . ”
84906	84911	84912	84912	I	0	“ A real PGA ? ”
84917	84922	84923	84923	Ryan	160	“ It ’s awful , ”

85064	85081	85061	85061	Ryan	160	“ I thought you were bringing me a treat . I ’m so disappointed in you . ”
85082	85096	85039	85039	Landon	87	“ No luck . You ’ll just have to settle for someone else . ”

85109	85138	85104	85104	He	160	“ Well , come on . I tee off in a couple of hours , and we should head to the clubhouse before I have to warm up . ”

85466	85497	85463	85463	He	87	“ Yes , golf is a spectator sport . Most people in here are professionals waiting for their tee time or those who did n’t make it to this round . ”
85498	85508	85463	85463	He	87	“ There are a lot of women in here . ”
85509	85548	85549	85549	We	1736	“ Yeah , well , wives show up to this tournament a lot . It technically closes out the season until January . And , really , anyone can get in here as long as they know someone . ”

85854	85873	85844	85844	Ryan	160	“ Oh God , is this your high school sweetheart who you told me about that one time ? ”
85874	85877	85878	85878	Landon	87	“ No , ”
85942	85960	85928	85928	Emery	80	“ We never dated in high school . I ’ve just known him for a long time . ”

86785	86816	86817	86817	I	0	“ Yeah . She was talking to that guy Ben that you know . Telling him that they ’ve wanted each other forever and that he could now have her . ”
86824	86838	86839	86839	Heidi	87	“ God , she gives the term nineteenth hole a whole new meaning . ”
86842	86854	86839	86839	Heidi	87	“ Nineteenth hole ? God , you golfers are really gross ! ”
86855	86880	86898	86898	I	0	“ You do n’t even want to know . Double bogey and water holes have double meanings , too . You can probably guess . ”
86881	86890	86891	86891	I	0	“ Oh … wow . I probably can . ”
86909	86918	86891	86891	I	0	“ You know , if you ’re interested … ”

86933	86957	86925	86925	she	77	“ Right . Escaping my crazy ex is the number one priority . Dirty bedroom play can be considered at a later time . ”

87301	87310	87311	87311	she	77	“ Fucking sun ! I put on sunscreen , ”
87314	87321	87311	87311	she	77	“ You are kind of pale . ”
87322	87327	87328	87328	she	77	“ Kind of pale ? ”
87340	87354	87328	87328	she	77	“ I was a ghost , and now , I ’m a lobster . ”

87414	87433	87411	87411	I	0	“ What ? That was the whole reason we came — because you got the tickets from Ryan . ”
87434	87499	87328	87328	she	77	“ That gave me the push to bring you , but really , I just wanted to spend some time with you and show you a golf tournament . One day , I want to get back to this . I hope I can get back to this . And , when I do , I wanted you to see what it was like . ”
87500	87509	87510	87510	she	1786	“ Golf groupies always throwing themselves at you ? ”
87513	87556	87510	87510	she	1786	“ That is an unfortunate part of the job , but most of the golfers on the Tour are deeply devoted to their girlfriends or wives and would never deal with that nonsense . And that ’s all it is — nonsense . ”
87557	87565	87566	87566	I	0	“ Is that how you met Miranda ? ”
87571	87608	87566	87566	I	0	“ Well , she was n’t exactly a groupie . She was a nurse for the Tour . So , I saw her all the time since we traveled to a lot of the same events . ”
87609	87621	87510	87510	she	1786	“ She was a nurse ? Did n’t see that coming . ”
87622	87632	87510	87510	she	1786	“ Yeah . She quit after we got married . ”
87633	87651	87566	87566	I	0	“ Huh . And you did n’t think that weird . Like she planned it all along ? ”
87652	87667	87668	87668	I	0	“ There are a lot of things that I regret about being with Miranda , ”
87672	87708	87668	87668	I	0	“ And , though I see her for the person she is now , I did n’t at the time . None of it matters now . All that matters is that I have you . ”
87722	87753	87709	87709	I	0	“ You never hide yourself from me , and I do n’t have to be someone different for you . That is why I think we should skip the dinner . ”
87758	87763	87754	87754	She	1787	“ That ’s why ? ”
87764	87781	87709	87709	I	0	“ I ’d rather do anything other than run into my ex . How about you ? ”
87782	87786	87787	87787	she	1787	“ All right , ”
87793	87801	87787	87787	she	1787	“ What do you have in mind ? ”
87802	87817	87709	87709	I	0	“ Anything . Let ’s go find a restaurant and have our own dinner . ”
87818	87823	87824	87824	she	1787	“ That sounds nice , ”
87848	87859	87860	87860	I	0	“ But I ’m going to need a shower first . ”
87940	87952	87953	87953	she	1787	“ Mmm , Landon . We ’re never leaving this shower , ”
87956	87964	87953	87953	she	1787	“ You ’re damn right about that . ”
87978	87987	87988	87988	she	1787	“ A whole new definition of water hole , ”
88004	88007	87996	87996	she	1787	“ Fuck , ”

89038	89045	89029	89029	he	87	“ The weekend was so perfect . ”
89046	89055	89029	89029	he	87	“ So , you ’re sad about that ? ”
89056	89083	89029	89029	he	87	“ Only that … we’re not together at home . That ’s not our reality . And I got used to you being my boyfriend here . ”
89084	89087	89088	89088	he	87	“ Heidi , ”
89094	89101	89088	89088	he	87	“ We ’ll figure it out . ”

89147	89156	89139	89139	I	0	“ I mean … what were you thinking ? ”
89157	89188	89189	89189	My	0	“ I did n’t tell him it was you . Only that I was dating someone on my floor , and I wanted him to find me a new spot . ”

89204	89250	89139	89139	I	0	“ No , he ’s not . There are a lot of girls on the floor . They ’re just not in engineering . And , anyway , he said to wait it out , and he would figure a way to make it work . ”
89251	89266	89267	89267	I	0	“ When did you talk to him ? Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
89271	89334	89267	89267	I	0	“ Um … at church , a week ago . I did n’t tell you because I did n’t want to get your hopes up . I do n’t know how long it could take . He does n’t know it ’s you . He thinks that my new girl is someone I just met and that I ’ll get over it . ”
89335	89339	89139	89139	I	0	“ How charming . ”
89340	89349	89139	89139	I	0	“ Jensen is just looking out for me . ”

90035	90057	90028	90028	I	0	“ Just saw it in the pile of mail . You still have n’t read any of them , have you ? ”
90058	90080	90081	90081	Landon	87	“ No . Because I ’m not going to ever read them . I do n’t want to talk to him . ”
90096	90152	90081	90081	Landon	87	“ You should n’t compartmentalize this the way that you do , Heidi . I know that you miss him . I know that you only allow yourself one day a year to think about him . But it ’s here every single week as a reminder . Are n’t you the least bit curious ? ”
90153	90156	90157	90157	I	0	“ No , ”
90161	90186	90157	90157	I	0	“ I ’m not curious . I do n’t want to hear from the man who did everything he could to ruin my life . ”

90209	90268	90206	90206	I	0	“ You did n’t think that way about him in high school , and he was using then . He might have fucked up . He might have done horrible things . But he loves you . He put you through cheerleading . He came to all of the football games . He threw you that graduation party . ”
90269	90321	90081	90081	Landon	87	“ Ancient history ! I ca n’t forget about all the times that I had to take care of his drunk ass when I was the kid . I was the one who needed to be taken care of . Throwing money at a problem does n’t make it go away . ”
90322	90329	90330	90330	Landon	87	“ No , it does n’t , ”
90347	90403	90336	90336	He	87	“ But the last thing I said to my dad before he died was something horrible , and I would give anything to have one more day with him . One more moment to make things right . But I will never have that . You have that , and you ’re throwing it away . ”
90528	90565	90513	90513	Landon	87	“ Hey , it ’s okay . You do n’t have to decide today . I just do n’t want you to ignore him forever and live to regret never having a relationship with him again . ”
90566	90575	90576	90576	I	0	“ I do n’t know if I can . ”
90579	90588	90576	90576	I	0	“ You ’ll know when it ’s time . ”

90915	90927	90928	90928	Emery	80	“ So , you ’re actually going to read the letters ? ”
90933	90953	90928	90928	Emery	80	“ I do n’t know . I think … I’ll know when it ’s the right time . Right ? ”
90954	90984	91029	91029	I	0	“ Lover girl , you ’ve been waiting this long . Are you sure you ’ll know ? Maybe you should do it now and get it over with . ”
90985	91010	91029	91029	I	0	“ No , Landon said he ’d be here with me . I think I ’ll need all the emotional support I can get . ”
91011	91020	90928	90928	Emery	80	“ Well , I ’m here , too . ”

91326	91359	91292	91292	He	87	“ I was at a bar with some friends , and I met her there . Her name is Wendy , and she ’s perfect for me . I just know it . ”

93326	93346	93317	93317	Emery	80	“ Did you and Landon break up ? What did he do to you ? I ’ll kill him . ”
93347	93352	93353	93353	I	0	“ I … I … ”
93365	93370	93353	93353	I	0	“ I got fired . ”

93411	93417	93371	93371	Emery	80	“ Probably fucking my boss . ”
93418	93426	93427	93427	Emery	80	“ It ’s just rumor and speculation , ”
93430	93481	93427	93427	Emery	80	“ I mean , what do they know ? They ’re grasping at straws . You can deny it . Landon will stick up for you . We ’ll tell Jensen and Morgan . We ’ll get this straightened out . They ca n’t do that . It ’s unlawful . ”
93482	93487	93371	93371	Emery	80	“ They have proof . ”
93488	93492	93493	93493	Emery	80	“ What proof ? ”
93506	93534	93371	93371	Emery	80	“ Landon and I went to a golf tournament together this weekend , and someone took videos of us together . I watched one of us kissing . ”

93645	93674	93624	93624	Emery	80	“ God . Okay , I ’m going to text her and see if she ’ll come over . Maybe we can figure out who sent it in . ”
93701	93704	93705	93705	she	106	“ Hey , ”
93709	93714	93715	93715	Emery	80	“ Come on in , ”
93718	93722	93715	93715	Emery	80	“ Is she … ”
93723	93732	93733	93733	Julia	106	“ A wreck but not mad at you . ”
93736	93753	93733	93733	Julia	106	“ Thank God . That was the hardest thing I ’ve ever done at work before . ”
93791	93801	93802	93802	Emery	80	“ Did it say who that email was from ? ”
93805	93812	93813	93813	Julia	106	“ No , it was anonymous . ”
93816	93851	93813	93813	Julia	106	“ I thought it was weird , but there were enough different images that we could n’t think that they had been doctored . Then , Heidi agreed that they ’d gone away together . ”
93852	93868	93869	93869	I	0	“ I did n’t know you were going to fire me if I said yes , ”
93872	93888	93869	93869	I	0	“ I know . I ’m sorry . I feel like the worst friend ever . ”
93889	93898	93899	93899	Emery	80	“ How is Landon taking all of this ? ”
93954	93960	93961	93961	Julia	106	“ I have no idea , ”
93964	93983	93961	93961	Julia	106	“ He was in some meeting for the higher - ups all day . I never saw him . ”
93984	93990	93991	93991	Emery	80	“ Does he even know ? ”
93994	94012	93991	93991	Emery	80	“ I mean … he has to know , right ? You ran this by him first ? ”
94013	94059	93961	93961	Julia	106	“ I … I do n’t know . I thought that everyone had done what they were supposed to do in this situation . It was n’t my job to follow up with Landon . I mean … I thought he had already been questioned . ”
94060	94069	94070	94070	I	0	“ Heidi , you should probably text him . ”
94075	94078	94070	94070	I	0	“ No . ”
94079	94086	93961	93961	Julia	106	“ He might not even know . ”
94087	94092	94093	94093	I	0	“ I said no , ”
94223	94229	94230	94230	She	106	“ What did you do ? ”
94237	94241	94230	94230	She	106	“ Who me ? ”
94242	94247	94230	94230	She	106	“ I hate you . ”

94351	94362	94363	94363	I	0	“ I guess you can . Does n’t matter anymore , ”
94391	94399	94400	94400	he	1901	“ Emery said that you were fired , ”
94432	94437	94408	94408	he	1901	“ Happened this morning . ”
94438	94448	94449	94449	His	1901	“ Why did n’t you call or text me ? ”
94475	94482	94469	94469	his	1901	“ What would I have said ? ”
94483	94498	94408	94408	he	1901	“ I could have been here . We could have worked this out together . ”
94499	94614	94449	94449	His	1901	“ I think we already did . And it happened just like I ’d said it would , Landon . That time I told you what would happen and you did n’t listen . You just had to move forward . You had to have me . You could n’t listen to me when I told you that this could n’t work , that my job meant something to me , that I needed it . I even told you why I needed it , and that did n’t seem to be enough . You had to push . You had to demand . Well , congratulations ! You got exactly what you wanted . ”
94615	94622	94623	94623	he	1902	“ You think I wanted this ? ”
94628	94639	94623	94623	he	1902	“ You think I wanted you to lose your job ? ”
94640	94660	94661	94661	I	0	“ I think you did n’t care one way or another as long as you got what you wanted , ”
94677	94688	94669	94669	My	0	“ That is not true , and you know it . ”
94689	94696	94697	94697	I	0	“ No , I do n’t ! ”
94702	94726	94697	94697	I	0	“ Because here I am , without my job , and you get to keep yours because you ’re a fucking Wright brother . ”
94727	94749	94669	94669	My	0	“ I did n’t even know that this was happening . I never would have let them do this to you . ”
94750	94776	94777	94777	I	0	“ Well , it seems we ’ve found something you ’re not good at . I thought what we had between us felt so right . ”
94785	94790	94777	94777	I	0	“ I was wrong . ”
94791	94794	94795	94795	he	1902	“ Heidi , ”
94807	94828	94798	94798	He	1902	“ Please , love , let me fix this . I can make this right . I know I can . ”
94829	94866	94867	94867	I	0	“ No , you ca n’t . And you do n’t really want to . You all have millions of dollars . You ’re a fucking celebrity . How could you possibly understand someone like me ? ”
94872	94885	94886	94886	he	1902	“ I did n’t think any of that ever mattered to you , ”
94890	94907	94886	94886	he	1902	“ And here I thought that I mattered to you . Guess we were both wrong . ”
94987	94992	94993	94993	I	0	“ You should leave , ”
94997	95005	94993	94993	I	0	“ Please , do n’t do this . ”
95006	95012	94995	94995	him	1902	“ I said , leave . ”

95031	95039	95024	95024	I	0	“ Just go , Landon . Now . ”
95118	95121	95122	95122	I	0	“ Fuck ! ”
95453	95456	95441	95441	I	0	“ Jensen ! ”

95517	95525	95511	95511	He	79	“ You ’re bleeding on my desk . ”
95526	95539	95511	95511	He	79	“ Let me repeat myself . What the fuck did you do ? ”
95540	95559	95511	95511	He	79	“ Landon , I did n’t do anything . But I know what you ’re going to say . ”
95560	95567	95511	95511	He	79	“ No , you do n’t ! ”
95568	95588	95511	95511	He	79	“ Yes , I think I do . Now , have a seat and talk to me about this . ”
95589	95593	95511	95511	He	79	“ I quit ! ”
95604	95607	95608	95608	he	79	“ Sit , ”
95616	95690	95608	95608	he	79	“ I ’m not going to sit down and be a good boy , Jensen ! This is outrageous . I told you I was seeing someone , and then Heidi got fired before I was even told about what was happening . Do n’t you think that ’s fucking ridiculous ? I would never have let that happen to her , and now , you have lost one of your best employees , ”
95696	95734	95691	95691	I	0	“ So , yeah , I quit . I need the job , but I do n’t need it this much . Give Heidi her job back , and let me fucking figure out my own thing . ”
95742	95747	95735	95735	Jensen	79	“ Are you done ? ”
95748	95762	95889	95889	He	79	“ Am I fucking done ? That ’s all you have to say ? ”
95763	95790	95889	95889	He	79	“ Well , are you going to clean up your hand , was second , but I thought I ’d lead with the more important question . ”
95791	95800	95735	95735	Jensen	79	“ Did you hear a word I said ? ”
95801	95846	95889	95889	He	79	“ Of course I did , Landon . But you ’re not quitting the company . I did n’t know that Heidi had been fired until it had already happened , and I ’m working on discovering who is behind the videos that surfaced . ”
95847	95875	95889	95889	He	79	“ Who cares where the videos came from ? What matters is that Heidi needs this job , and you stole it from her because of me . ”
95876	95884	95885	95885	Jensen	79	“ I understand that you ’re upset , ”
95903	95916	95889	95889	He	79	“ But you ca n’t think clearly when you ’re like this . ”
95930	95955	95917	95917	I	0	“ Heidi broke up with me because of this shit . I do n’t need to think clearly . I need to fix this . ”
95956	95965	95966	95966	Jensen	79	“ What happened to Heidi was … unfortunate , ”
95974	96074	95966	95966	Jensen	79	“ It was handled poorly . I understand that the employees in her department believed they were doing the right thing to contain the situation and avoid a scandal . However , as you were not notified , no investigation was put into it other than to assume that the evidence had n’t been doctored . We both know that this is n’t good for the company . And , obviously , it ’s not good for your relationship with Heidi . And , by the way … Heidi ? No wonder you did n’t want to tell me . ”
96075	96098	96099	96099	Jensen	79	“ Yeah , well , I did want to tell you , but I did n’t want her to get fucking fired . ”
96109	96144	96103	96103	his	79	“ Look , speaking as the CEO of this company and your boss , the evidence was pretty damning , and everyone reacted quickly to minimize the damage . Have you seen the videos ? ”
96150	96160	96145	96145	I	0	“ I did n’t even know what they had . ”
96244	96249	96250	96250	I	0	“ Well , fuck , ”
96259	96275	96250	96250	I	0	“ I agree . After watching these , do you see why she was fired ? ”
96284	96300	96281	96281	I	0	“ I know why they did it , but I still want to fix it . ”
96301	96374	96375	96375	I	0	“ The way to fix this is to figure out who sent these . It was anonymous . I already have someone looking into it . The way these images were sent to us feels like a threat . It was pointed . Not sent to me or Morgan , but directly to Heidi ’s immediate supervisor . Does Heidi have any enemies ? Anyone who would want to see her fired ? ”
96380	96412	96413	96413	Jensen	79	“ I do n’t know . I do n’t think so . Wait , maybe this Matt guy who works in her department . He wanted the promotion that she got . ”
96421	96436	96415	96415	his	79	“ He has motive , but would he have had access to these videos ? ”
96437	96445	96415	96415	his	79	“ Fuck , I do n’t know . ”
96446	96451	96415	96415	his	79	“ And do you ? ”
96452	96457	96458	96458	Jensen	79	“ Do I what ? ”
96484	96497	96477	96477	He	79	“ Do you know anyone who would benefit from Heidi getting fired ? ”
96513	96516	96498	96498	I	0	“ Miranda . ”
96517	96528	96477	96477	He	79	“ Yeah . That ’s where I landed , too . ”
96529	96536	96537	96537	I	0	“ She was at the tournament , ”
96541	96584	96537	96537	I	0	“ Heidi saw her briefly . She was trying to pick up a golf buddy of mine to replace me , but we did n’t see her the rest of the weekend . We skipped a dinner and everything to avoid her . ”
96585	96592	96593	96593	Jensen	79	“ Did n’t seem to work , ”
96600	96608	96593	96593	Jensen	79	“ Fuck . What a conniving bitch ! ”
96609	96618	96537	96537	I	0	“ I would n’t put it past her . ”
96619	96637	96537	96537	I	0	“ Oh , I ’m going to call her and give her a piece of my mind . ”
96638	96718	96593	96593	Jensen	79	“ I ’m certain that ’s what she wants from you — a reaction . It ’s best for us to dig a little deeper and see if we can nail her on something like this . Let ’s make sure it ’s really her and not this … Matt guy . Then , we ’ll decide where to go from there . A judge will not look kindly on threats if she ’s trying to get more money . ”
96719	96726	96537	96537	I	0	“ I could wring her neck . ”
96727	96735	96736	96736	Jensen	79	“ I would also advise against that , ”
96741	96749	96736	96736	Jensen	79	“ Though I know the feeling well . ”
96762	96803	96750	96750	I	0	“ What the fuck do I do , man ? Heidi freaked out on me and forced me out of her apartment . I ’m head over heels for that girl , and she wo n’t even talk to me . ”
96804	96835	96537	96537	I	0	“ As your brother , I ’d tell you to fight for her . If you ’re willing to throw everything away for her , she must be worth it . ”
96836	96845	96537	96537	I	0	“ She is . She is worth it . ”
96846	96870	96750	96750	I	0	“ You know , Emery suspected something was going on with y’ all back in December , but I thought she was crazy . ”
96871	96926	96927	96927	I	0	“ Yeah . She was right . I tried to deny that anything was happening back then and tried to say we were just talking a lot . But that ’s a lie . I ’d fallen for her , and I stopped talking to her when I realized I had feelings for her . ”
96930	96941	96927	96927	I	0	“ Did n’t want to be a cheating douche bag . ”
96942	96953	96750	96750	I	0	“ I think that was smart . All things considered . ”
96954	96974	96750	96750	I	0	“ Yeah , but now , when I finally get her , it all blows up in my face . ”
96975	96982	96983	96983	Jensen	79	“ You ’ll work through it , ”
96988	96998	96983	96983	Jensen	79	“ You should just try and talk to her . ”
96999	97037	97038	97038	Jensen	79	“ No , she wo n’t listen to me . She unloaded when I stepped into her apartment . The last thing she wants to do is talk to me . She ’s blaming me for this . ”
97047	97057	97038	97038	Jensen	79	“ What if I tried to talk to her ? ”
97063	97069	97058	97058	I	0	“ You ’d do that ? ”
97070	97116	97044	97044	his	79	“ She was my employee after all . Until we get this all cleared up , I ca n’t do anything about her job , but I can try to fix how this was handled and let her know that you were not at fault . ”
97117	97122	97123	97123	I	0	“ I … yeah , ”
97168	97174	97159	97159	I	0	“ That ’d be great . ”
97175	97191	97192	97192	I	0	“ Okay . I ’ll do that now . You go clean up your hand . ”
97362	97365	97366	97366	I	0	“ What ? ”
97386	97392	97393	97393	I	0	“ She did n’t answer . ”
97396	97399	97393	97393	I	0	“ And ? ”
97400	97403	97428	97428	his	79	“ Nothing . ”
97404	97409	97410	97410	He	79	“ And , Jensen ? ”
97413	97418	97410	97410	He	79	“ She texted back . ”
97419	97425	97426	97426	He	79	“ What did she say ? ”
97555	97565	97552	97552	He	79	“ Hey , man , where are you going ? ”
97566	97571	97552	97552	He	79	“ To find Austin . ”
97572	97577	97552	97552	He	79	“ What ? Why ? ”
97578	97590	97552	97552	He	79	“ Because I know he ’ll have a spare bottle handy . ”
97591	97597	97552	97552	He	79	“ I have alcohol here . ”
97598	97634	97552	97552	He	79	“ Fuck off , Jensen . I want to get wasted and not think about how my girlfriend broke up with me or how I lost the best thing that had ever happened to me . ”
97635	97638	97639	97639	Jensen	79	“ Shit , ”
97642	97649	97639	97639	Jensen	79	“ I ’m coming with you . ”
97650	97653	97654	97654	I	0	“ Fine , ”
97771	97783	97750	97750	Emery	80	“ You can not do this . You ca n’t wallow . ”
97784	97798	97750	97750	Emery	80	“ Yes , I can . What else do I have to do ? ”
97799	97871	97757	97757	she	80	“ Heidi Anne Martin ! You are a strong , independent , unbelievably incredible woman . You will pick yourself up from this and keep going . This is not the end of your life . You are a brilliant engineer , and anyone would be lucky to have you . Just because you are no longer gainfully employed by Wright Construction does not change a damn thing about your awesomeness . ”
97872	97881	97750	97750	Emery	80	“ You ’re a great friend , Em . ”
97882	97886	97887	97887	She	1936	“ Damn straight ! ”
97894	97899	97900	97900	I	0	“ Now , go . ”
97945	97953	97954	97954	I	0	“ What is this ? An intervention ? ”
97991	97998	97999	97999	Julia	106	“ Hell yes , it is , ”
98002	98022	97999	97999	Julia	106	“ Now , turn your cute ass around , and put on something presentable . We ’re going out . ”
98023	98030	97973	97973	they	1937	“ I ’m not going out . ”
98031	98040	98041	98041	Emery	80	“ Do n’t make us come in there , ”
98044	98070	98041	98041	Emery	80	“ We ’re trying to get you back on your feet . You have n’t left the house in three days . It ’s time . ”
98076	98082	98041	98041	Emery	80	“ Where are we going ? ”
98083	98086	98100	98100	They	1937	“ Shopping . ”
98087	98096	98097	98097	I	0	“ God , y’ all are the worst , ”
98129	98132	98133	98133	Julia	106	“ Whatever , ”
98136	98141	98133	98133	Julia	106	“ Just hurry up ! ”
98385	98389	98390	98390	Emery	80	“ This one , ”
98447	98456	98457	98457	I	0	“ Where the hell would I wear this ? ”
98472	98484	98467	98467	They	1896	“ Oh no . Is there a bigger plot happening here ? ”
98485	98491	98492	98492	Emery	80	“ Just try it on , ”
98495	98504	98505	98505	Julia	106	“ You ’ll look so hot in that ! ”
98508	98546	98505	98505	Julia	106	“ I ’m going to go with something black , of course . But pink ? Man , no one can pull off pink like you . With that long blonde hair and those bright blue eyes . ”
98547	98550	98551	98551	Emery	80	“ Whoa , ”
98559	98567	98551	98551	Emery	80	“ Stop moving in on my woman . ”
98603	98606	98607	98607	Julia	106	“ Success ! ”
98610	98617	98607	98607	Julia	106	“ I knew shopping would work , ”

98790	98818	98819	98819	I	0	“ It ’s not even fair . Your genetics are unreal . Why were you given all the good genes ? You ’re as bad as Kimber . ”
98882	98889	98890	98890	Julia	106	“ You have to get it , ”
98902	98920	98890	98890	Julia	106	“ I have nowhere to wear it , and I ’m sure I ca n’t afford it . ”
98921	98924	98925	98925	Emery	80	“ Look , ”
98939	98958	98925	98925	Emery	80	“ We ’re all really worried about you . I know how much this job meant to you . ”
98959	98969	98890	98890	Julia	106	“ I really do n’t think that you do . ”
98970	98993	98994	98994	I	0	“ Heidi , I ’ve known you my whole life . I know that you have wanted to succeed in this forever . ”

99009	99018	98890	98890	Julia	106	“ What ? What do n’t I know ? ”
99019	99023	99024	99024	I	0	“ My dad , ”
99028	99036	99024	99024	I	0	“ My dad used my college funds . ”
99037	99042	99043	99043	Her	1958	“ He used your … ”
99048	99054	99043	99043	Her	1958	“ Oh . Oh God . ”
99055	99058	99059	99059	Julia	106	“ What ? ”
99062	99068	99059	99059	Julia	106	“ What am I missing ? ”
99069	99088	99089	99089	I	0	“ He used my college funds on drugs and shackled me with student loan debt and then some , ”
99093	99121	99089	99089	I	0	“ So , I needed the job more than anyone even knew . And , now , I do n’t know what I ’m going to do . ”
99122	99129	99130	99130	Emery	80	“ Heidi , I ’m sorry , ”
99133	99141	99130	99130	Emery	80	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
99142	99149	99150	99150	I	0	“ Because I was handling it , ”
99156	99166	99150	99150	I	0	“ And now … now , I ’m not . ”
99167	99216	99130	99130	Emery	80	“ Well , I think you should talk to Jensen . We talked , and I know he ’s worried about you and Landon . He ’s been going out and drinking every night with Austin and Patrick . We all know that ’s not a smart decision . ”
99217	99226	99227	99227	I	0	“ I do n’t want to hear it , ”
99235	99282	99227	99227	I	0	“ Well , I ’m sorry . You need to . Jensen has been trying to get ahold of you . I know that he wants to apologize to you about how this was all handled and that they ’re looking into the circumstances behind it . ”
99283	99289	99130	99130	Emery	80	“ Em , just stop . ”
99290	99300	99130	99130	Emery	80	“ Come on , please . Talk to him . ”
99301	99308	99227	99227	I	0	“ I already texted him back . ”
99309	99313	99314	99314	Emery	80	“ I know , ”
99320	99323	99314	99314	Emery	80	“ But — ”
99324	99363	99227	99227	I	0	“ There is no but to this conversation , Em . I know what you ’re trying to do . But I do not want to talk about Jensen Wright or Landon Wright or any of the Wrights . ”
99364	99372	99373	99373	Emery	80	“ But it is n’t their fault , ”
99376	99395	99373	99373	Emery	80	“ It is n’t ? I was n’t just fired from the company that they own and operate ? ”
99396	99402	99227	99227	I	0	“ You were , but — ”
99403	99419	99420	99420	I	0	“ Are you really going to try to stand there and defend them to me ? ”
99423	99430	99420	99420	I	0	“ You , of all people ? ”
99503	99518	99519	99519	Emery	80	“ I ’m not defending how it all went down . It was shitty , ”
99537	99588	99534	99534	her	80	“ But I know none of them knew that it was happening . They were n’t even aware that you were fired or that you were dating Landon until after it all happened . You need to talk to someone . If not Landon , at least talk to Jensen . ”
99607	99610	99595	99595	I	0	“ No . ”
99611	99614	99534	99534	her	80	“ Heidi — ”
99615	99681	99534	99534	her	80	“ It ’s over , Emery . I got fired because of Landon . No matter how you try to twist it around , that is what happened . It ’s on him . Do n’t you remember that Landon who shattered your heart , lied to you , and ignored you for months ? This should n’t be that hard for you to grasp . ”
99682	99698	99699	99699	I	0	“ That was ten years ago , Heidi ! And he ’s different with you . ”
99702	99707	99699	99699	I	0	“ Yeah , right . ”
99708	99716	99717	99717	Julia	106	“ Um , can I cut in ? ”
99720	99764	99717	99717	Julia	106	“ I did n’t know Landon ten years ago . I do n’t really know him now . But I do know that he has been awful at work since you left . I have never seen a grown man mope like that . ”
99765	99768	99769	99769	I	0	“ Jesus , ”
99780	99881	99772	99772	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Okay ? I do n’t know anything . I do n’t really even want to be discussing this . I lost my job and boyfriend all in one day . I am broken and beaten and depressed . My heart is an empty wasteland where Landon Wright used to occupy . And I want things to go back to the way they were . But how can I be with someone who was so careless with the thing I held most dear ? It ’s not something that is going to be fixed overnight . ”
99882	99885	99886	99886	Emery	80	“ Okay , ”
99890	99917	99886	99886	Emery	80	“ We did n’t mean to push . I think you should talk to Jensen when you ’re ready . Even if that ’s not today . ”
99918	99925	99926	99926	Julia	106	“ It ’s a good idea , ”
99929	99990	99926	99926	Julia	106	“ Keeping this all bottled up does not help . Trust me , I know . I ’ve been in therapy for years , trying to get over my crazy ex . I wish I ’d had friends like you and Emery back then . Running away does n’t always solve the problem . That ’s all I ’m saying . ”
99991	100008	100009	100009	I	0	“ Yeah , maybe . I know your situation is so crazier than this , Julia , ”
100015	100029	100009	100009	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I ’ll think about it , okay ? ”
100064	100078	100054	100054	I	0	“ What were you trying to get me to buy this for anyway ? ”
100079	100083	100084	100084	Julia	106	“ Charity Benefit , ”
100090	100111	100087	100087	I	0	“ You thought I ’d go to the Wright event after this week ? Are you out of your minds ? ”
100120	100125	100126	100126	Emery	80	“ Maybe a little , ”
100129	100139	100140	100140	Julia	106	“ We could make it a girls ’ trip , ”
100143	100147	100140	100140	Julia	106	“ Free champagne ? ”
100148	100151	100126	100126	Emery	80	“ No . ”
100152	100155	100156	100156	Emery	80	“ Humph , ”
100159	100165	100156	100156	Emery	80	“ Just think about it . ”
100166	100169	100126	100126	Emery	80	“ No . ”
100170	100177	100178	100178	Julia	106	“ I ’m buying the dress , ”
100185	100202	100178	100178	Julia	106	“ Just as a backup . In case you change your mind and go with us . ”
100856	100859	100860	100860	She	1984	“ Heidi . ”

100928	100943	100910	100910	her	1984	“ Sorry about that . I was n’t expecting anyone else to be here . ”
100944	100948	100910	100910	her	1984	“ Me either . ”
100949	100954	100910	100910	her	1984	“ Heidi , I — ”

100999	101011	100992	100992	She	1984	“ I thought you ’d be at a bar with Austin . ”
101012	101015	100962	100962	she	1984	“ Why ? ”
101016	101030	100962	100962	she	1984	“ I do n’t know . Emery said you ’d been going out . ”
101031	101052	101053	101053	She	1984	“ Yeah , well , it ’s hard not to want to drink when your girlfriend breaks up with you . ”
101056	101060	101053	101053	She	1984	“ I bet . ”
101061	101092	100962	100962	she	1984	“ Man , I did n’t come over here to guilt - trip you . I … I wanted to see you . I ’ve missed you like fucking crazy . ”
101093	101097	101053	101053	She	1984	“ I know . ”
101098	101106	100962	100962	she	1984	“ Emery tell you that , too ? ”
101117	101123	101114	101114	her	1984	“ No . Personal experience . ”
101191	101196	101185	101185	I	0	“ Come with me . ”
101197	101200	101185	101185	I	0	“ Landon … ”
101201	101207	101212	101212	she	1984	“ Just … trust me . ”
101248	101252	101253	101253	she	1984	“ Your parents , ”
101256	101267	101253	101253	she	1984	“ Yeah . Um … I’ve never done this before , ”
101278	101322	101268	101268	I	0	“ But , Mom … Dad … this is Heidi . She ’s , uh … well , a friend . Actually , she broke my heart , but I love her so much that I wanted to introduce her to you anyway . ”
101323	101326	101378	101378	her	1984	“ Landon … ”
101327	101335	101336	101336	I	0	“ Stop saying my name like that , ”
101344	101375	101336	101336	I	0	“ You sound so dejected when you say it like that . I want to remember the way you said it when you were moaning it on top of me . ”
101389	101394	101378	101378	her	1984	“ I should go . ”
101395	101407	101378	101378	her	1984	“ Heidi , I understand why you blame me for this . ”
101408	101418	101419	101419	she	1984	“ You do n’t seem like you get it , ”
101430	101443	101444	101444	I	0	“ I do . I get it because it ’s my fault . ”
101447	101503	101444	101444	I	0	“ Jensen is looking into who sent the videos to the company , and my guess is , it was Miranda . And , if I ’m right , then you ’re right . It is my fault that all of this happened . Because my bitch ex is trying to get back at me . ”
101504	101512	101378	101378	her	1984	“ You think Miranda took those videos ? ”
101513	101536	101444	101444	I	0	“ I think it ’s a real possibility that she would want you to get fired after finding out we were together . ”
101537	101548	101549	101549	I	0	“ But would n’t she have sent them to Jensen ? ”
101553	101610	101549	101549	I	0	“ No . She hates my family . All of them . She would know that Jensen would side with me and keep this quiet . And , you know , I should have seen this about her all along . You asked me once , ‘ Why her ? ’ Why did I marry her ? ”
101623	101666	101611	101611	I	0	“ I ’ve been saying for a long time that it was because she was n’t this person when we met and I thought she loved me . I do n’t think I was willing to see what I ’d actually done . ”
101667	101679	101680	101680	She	1991	“ What do you mean ? That you married a psycho ? ”
101685	101809	101680	101680	She	1991	“ Yes . I thought I was making the right choice . My dad wanted me to be with someone worthy of the Wright name . That ’s why he did n’t want me with Emery . He did n’t think she was good enough . So , when I met Miranda out of college , she came from old money , worked as a nurse on the Tour , seemed to know the ins and outs of golf , and fit right into my life . I thought … I thought it was what my dad would have wanted . Even after I found out her parents were bankrupt and I helped them get out of debt , I was still blinded . ”
101810	101819	101820	101820	Heidi	87	“ You paid off her parent ’s debts ? ”
101823	101879	101820	101820	Heidi	87	“ Yeah . No one knows . I thought it was the right thing to do at the time . I had married their daughter after all . But , if I ’d just realized then how crazy she was and how much she was using me , we would n’t be here right now . ”
101880	101886	101887	101887	Heidi	87	“ Maybe . Maybe not , ”
101890	101927	101887	101887	Heidi	87	“ I do n’t want to talk about Miranda or think about the person I was when I was with her . I only want to be exactly who I am when I ’m with you . ”
101995	101998	101980	101980	She	1992	“ Thanks . ”
102012	102024	101999	101999	Her	1992	“ I ’m sorry for yelling at you the other day . ”
102032	102036	101999	101999	Her	1992	“ You are ? ”
102037	102078	101999	101999	Her	1992	“ I was angry and frustrated and so , so pissed off . I took all of that out on you . Whether or not you think it ’s your fault , you did n’t deserve how I treated you . ”
102079	102085	102086	102086	I	0	“ Heidi , my firecracker , ”
102092	102104	102086	102086	I	0	“ I could never love you less for yelling at me . ”
102118	102126	102113	102113	she	1993	“ But I ca n’t do this . ”
102127	102130	102131	102131	I	0	“ What ? ”
102144	102150	102131	102131	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
102151	102159	102160	102160	she	1993	“ What I ’m feeling is crippling , ”
102164	102203	102160	102160	she	1993	“ Completely physically debilitating . It is turning my entire world upside down , and I ’m trying to find where I still fit in . I lost my job and my identity all in one fell swoop . ”
102204	102222	102223	102223	I	0	“ Do n’t you think that I , of all people , understand what that ’s like ? ”
102226	102300	102223	102223	I	0	“ When I injured my back , golf was gone . Something I had been doing my entire life . The only job I had ever known . And not just that , but I was physically limited from that point on . I was half the man that I had been all because of one bad swing . I think I can understand what it feels like to have an identity crisis . ”
102301	102362	102363	102363	She	1994	“ Fuck , I know . I do know that you have been here before . And I ’m sorry that I yelled at you , but it does n’t really change how I feel . It does n’t change the fact that what happened … I associate with you and your family . So , it makes this hard . ”
102368	102373	102363	102363	She	1994	“ Being with me ? ”
102374	102379	102380	102380	she	1994	“ Being near you , ”
102383	102454	102380	102380	she	1994	“ Seeing you and knowing that I love you and that I ca n’t let this go . That I ca n’t forgive and forget . That , right now , I hate the Wrights and everything they fucking stand for . Because I lost myself , got caught up in you , and did exactly what I ’d sworn I would n’t do . Now , I ’m fucked . ”
102455	102459	102460	102460	I	0	“ I see , ”
102507	102519	102501	102501	I	0	“ So , I just … I need time , Landon . ”
102528	102532	102533	102533	I	0	“ Of course , ”
102538	102561	102533	102533	I	0	“ It ’s the last thing that I want to give you , but I will if you think it will help . ”
102603	102607	102590	102590	She	1994	“ Keep it . ”
102608	102613	102582	102582	she	1994	“ I ca n’t . ”
102614	102637	102638	102638	I	0	“ Please , Heidi . Let me take care of you even if you do n’t want to be taken care of . ”
102675	102719	102669	102669	she	1994	“ You might hate me right now , but I ’ll be right here . If you need me , if you think you can move past what happened . I ’ll be here , trying to fix what I broke between us . ”
102731	102799	102720	102720	I	0	“ I should have waited for you . I should have probably waited until Jensen or Morgan moved me . There are a ton of things I could have done , but I ca n’t regret our time together . I never will . You stole my heart completely with that first kiss in the back of Flips , and I do n’t even want it back . ”
102816	102823	102808	102808	I	0	“ No more tears , love . ”
102824	102831	102832	102832	she	1994	“ I ’m sorry , Landon , ”
102869	102883	102884	102884	I	0	“ I can not believe that I let you talk me into this , ”
102903	102909	102910	102910	Emery	80	“ It ’ll be fine , ”
102961	103008	103009	103009	Julia	106	“ I have it on good authority that Landon is n’t even going to be here , and you know most of the company does n’t even show up . It ’s mostly for hoity - toity types with a lot of money to dish out , ”
103014	103023	103009	103009	Julia	106	“ Engineering would never show up for this . ”
103079	103088	103089	103089	I	0	“ And why is n’t Landon coming again ? ”
103101	103108	103109	103109	Emery	80	“ Jensen said he was busy , ”
103118	103125	103115	103115	Julia	106	“ I think he ’s busy . ”
103137	103149	103132	103132	I	0	“ He ’s going to be here , is n’t he ? ”
103150	103153	103154	103154	they	2005	“ No ! ”
103160	103171	103172	103172	I	0	“ Oh , Jesus , y’ all lied to me ? ”
103175	103188	103172	103172	I	0	“ Take me home ! I am not dealing with this tonight . ”
103189	103200	103201	103201	Emery	80	“ How else were we going to get you here ? ”
103209	103261	103201	103201	Emery	80	“ So … Landon might be here . I do n’t actually know . But we can still have a good time either way . I really did n’t want to go without you . Think about how much fun we had at Sutton ’s wedding because you dragged me there . ”
103262	103269	103172	103172	I	0	“ You ’re both shitty friends . ”
103270	103308	103309	103309	Julia	106	“ Free champagne . Free dinner . And a reason to wear a fancy dress . Fuck all the Wrights tonight , and let ’s just have a good time . What do you think , Heidi ? ”
103329	103353	103315	103315	Her	106	“ Okay , but steer me clear of them tonight , or I ca n’t promise that I wo n’t flip my shit . ”
103368	103371	103372	103372	Emery	80	“ Excellent , ”
103426	103430	103431	103431	Julia	106	“ Shall we ? ”
103638	103653	103632	103632	She	80	“ To free champagne , best friends , and a girls ’ night out . ”

103695	103703	103704	103704	Julia	106	“ To Emery being shitty at toasts , ”
103712	103719	103720	103720	I	0	“ I ’ll toast to that , ”

103812	103834	103809	103809	She	106	“ Not for a long time . I prefer blackjack or poker , but craps is pure entertainment . Less thinking . ”

103938	103946	103947	103947	Julia	106	“ Oh , I do n’t lose , ”
103958	103967	103952	103952	she	106	“ Um , maybe I should n’t play ? ”
103968	103973	103974	103974	Emery	80	“ I was kidding , ”
103977	103984	103974	103974	Emery	80	“ Of course you should play . ”

104132	104138	104124	104124	She	106	“ What do you want ? ”
104139	104144	104098	104098	Patrick	101	“ Need a drink ? ”
104145	104148	104149	104149	she	106	“ No , ”

104190	104201	104176	104176	his	78	“ Come walk with me . We should catch up . ”
104202	104209	104210	104210	she	106	“ No . Not with you , ”
104257	104264	104265	104265	I	0	“ Maybe just leave her alone , ”
104268	104282	104265	104265	I	0	“ I was simply asking her if I could get her a drink . ”
104283	104293	104294	104294	Julia	106	“ I do n’t want a drink from you , ”
104297	104304	104294	104294	Julia	106	“ Then how about a walk ? ”
104305	104317	104265	104265	I	0	“ I do n’t want to go anywhere with you either . ”
104318	104328	104329	104329	Julia	106	“ That ’s not what you said last time . ”
104334	104371	104329	104329	Julia	106	“ You used me and then ignored me , Austin . You ’re disgusting , and I ’d rather go anywhere than be around you . You ’re a user . That ’s what you do . ”
104372	104379	104380	104380	he	2026	“ Takes one to know one , ”
104432	104436	104437	104437	she	106	“ Fuck you , ”

104747	104762	104738	104738	he	87	“ Yeah . I , uh … was told you would n’t be here . ”
104773	104783	104784	104784	He	87	“ Of course you were . That sounds right . ”
104813	104818	104819	104819	he	87	“ You look incredible , ”
104823	104826	104819	104819	he	87	“ Thanks . ”
104912	104919	104920	104920	He	87	“ You look nice , too . ”

104947	104961	104920	104920	He	87	“ Unfortunately , that ’s how you can tell that he likes her . ”
104962	104982	104983	104983	Landon	87	“ Well , we ’re not on the playground anymore , and mean boys were n’t cute even then . ”
104989	105020	104985	104985	his	87	“ I was n’t defending his actions . I think what he said was wrong . But this is Austin . He ’s a total shit when he likes someone . ”
105071	105077	105078	105078	Landon	87	“ Do you want to … ”
105102	105111	105097	105097	their	2040	“ Do you really think that ’s smart ? ”
105112	105124	105078	105078	Landon	87	“ I find that I do n’t care in the slightest . ”
105168	105184	105185	105185	I	0	“ Yeah . I guess everyone already knows that I was fired because of you , ”
105191	105221	105185	105185	I	0	“ Actually , they do n’t . Besides your supervisor , Julia , and me , no one on your floor is aware of the reason for your absence . ”
105222	105225	105078	105078	Landon	87	“ Absence ? ”
105226	105229	105133	105133	Landon	87	“ Yes . ”
105230	105241	105242	105242	I	0	“ Everyone thinks that I ’m taking some time off ? ”
105247	105260	105242	105242	I	0	“ What kind of bullshit is that ? Saving your own asses ? ”
105261	105316	105133	105133	Landon	87	“ They were trying to avoid a scandal , Heidi . This could have been damaging to the Wright Construction brand . Far beyond the scope we ’d thought about . I , obviously , have been primarily focused on your needs , but I do understand what Jensen and Morgan are dealing with . ”
105317	105350	105351	105351	I	0	“ Right . Fire the expendable girl , cover it up so that you do n’t look bad , and then talk about how it could have hurt you and not her , ”
105354	105373	105374	105374	he	2042	“ That ’s not what I ’m saying at all . I ’m trying to get you back ! ”
105377	105392	105374	105374	he	2042	“ I already tried to quit , hoping to get you your job back . ”
105397	105401	105374	105374	he	2042	“ You did ? ”
105402	105428	105133	105133	Landon	87	“ Yeah . I went straight to Jensen after you broke up with me . I told him I ’d figure out my own shit . ”
105429	105436	105437	105437	I	0	“ I did n’t know that , ”
105444	105503	105437	105437	I	0	“ Yeah . But he refused . He said that , even if I quit , it would n’t guarantee you your job . At least not until they find out who sent the videos and if they were going to issue any more threats . Or at the very least until he could find me another position . ”

105518	105523	105524	105524	he	2043	“ Do n’t you ? ”
105527	105534	105524	105524	he	2043	“ And it worked , too . ”
105535	105544	105133	105133	Landon	87	“ You think Miranda was threatening the company ? ”
105545	105581	105524	105524	he	2043	“ Any threat against a member of the Wright family is a threat against the company . And those videos being leaked strategically show me with an employee . Yeah , that ’s a threat . ”
105673	105688	105689	105689	I	0	“ Fuck , she is trying for a bigger game , is n’t she ? ”
105692	105704	105689	105689	I	0	“ She wants something more than me out of the way . ”
105708	105741	105705	105705	Landon	143	“ Yeah , we ’re waiting for her to show her hand , and Jensen is trying to anticipate it . I ’m so sorry that you got caught in her crosshairs . ”
105750	105760	105742	105742	I	0	“ I think we ’re about to find out . ”
105761	105766	105767	105767	Landon	143	“ Why do you … ”
105878	105884	105885	105885	I	0	“ Do n’t engage her , ”
105904	105945	105889	105889	I	0	“ Landon , I am not going to sit back and let her assault you . If she ’s the bitch who made me lose my job , then I ’m going to give her a piece of my mind . ”
105956	105993	105999	105999	she	2051	“ You ’ll be giving her what she wants . It ’d be better if you let me handle this . She wants to fuck with me anyway . You ’re just … in her way . ”
105994	105998	105999	105999	she	2051	“ Fuck that , ”
106002	106009	106010	106010	I	0	“ I second that , love , ”

106089	106096	106097	106097	I	0	“ Ca n’t say the same , ”
106121	106146	106118	106118	Miranda	172	“ I guess Wright has really lowered their standards this year on who they let in to their biggest charity event of the season . ”
106154	106159	106147	106147	I	0	“ It seems so . ”
106160	106172	106114	106114	she	172	“ Oh , you ’re so adorable when you ’re upset . ”
106173	106181	106118	106118	Miranda	172	“ Did you do it , Miranda ? ”
106182	106196	106197	106197	she	172	“ Do what , pet ? I ’ve done a lot of things , ”
106203	106216	106217	106217	She	172	“ Did you take the videos and send them to the company ? ”
106224	106228	106217	106217	She	172	“ What videos ? ”
106229	106237	106118	106118	Miranda	172	“ You know damn well what videos . ”
106238	106259	106260	106260	She	172	“ I asked you point - blank if you were seeing someone else , Landon . You told me no . ”
106268	106275	106262	106262	her	172	“ I wanted proof for myself . ”

106306	106323	106324	106324	Miranda	172	“ I thought you would see the error of your ways and come back to me , ”
106370	106381	106382	106382	I	0	“ That ’s not ever going to happen , Miranda , ”
106386	106438	106382	106382	I	0	“ You should turn around and leave here now . Just sign the fucking paperwork and get out of my life with all your fucking manipulative ways and scheming . The fact that you could take those videos and send them to the company to try to get ahead disgusts me . ”
106439	106451	106452	106452	she	172	“ You were the one going behind my back and cheating , ”
106455	106469	106452	106452	she	172	“ Of course I hired a private investigator to look into my interests ! ”
106470	106477	106478	106478	I	0	“ I never cheated on you , ”
106486	106500	106478	106478	I	0	“ But I would never in a million years choose you over Heidi . ”
106578	106584	106585	106585	Miranda	172	“ You ’re not serious , ”
106588	106636	106585	106585	Miranda	172	“ You ’re so desperate to be with someone that you hooked up with your ex - girlfriend ’s best friend ? Were you disappointed that Jensen had claimed Emery , so you went for second best ? I mean , God , it ’s fucking repulsive . ”
106637	106642	106564	106567	the one for me	2056	“ Shut your mouth . ”
106643	106670	106585	106585	Miranda	172	“ Just face it , Landon . You ca n’t be alone . You ’re addicted to being in love , to being in a relationship . ”
106671	106719	106720	106720	Miranda	172	“ Maybe I do n’t like to be alone , but I ’d rather alone than be with you any day . And , fuck , Miranda , you have no room to talk . You were already trying to replace me with another golfer in Atlanta . ”
106725	106778	106779	106779	She	172	“ I had no interest in Ben . I was trying to check up on you . And it turned out , you had been lying to me , so I had good reason to do so . And , God , look at what you are trying to replace me with . ”
106808	106811	106812	106812	I	0	“ Miranda , ”
106815	106823	106824	106824	Miranda	172	“ I mean … you went slumming , ”
106831	106853	106824	106824	Miranda	172	“ So cute that you think Texas trailer trash with a drug - dealer daddy could ever replace someone like me . ”
106873	106878	106879	106879	Heidi	87	“ Go to hell ! ”
106882	106901	106879	106879	Heidi	87	“ Why do you have to try to ruin everyone else ’s lives just because you ’re miserable ? ”
106902	106928	106929	106929	Heidi	87	“ Oh , honey , I ’m not miserable . I had the best years of Landon Wright . Are you enjoying my sloppy seconds ? ”
106966	107016	107017	107017	Heidi	87	“ You ’re not even worth his time . You ’re certainly not worth mine . The fact that you flew all the way out here because you were so desperate and thought you could get him back if you got me out of the way is really pathetic . ”
107026	107032	107033	107033	Miranda	172	“ I actually pity you . ”
107036	107045	107033	107033	Miranda	172	“ I do n’t need anyone ’s pity . ”
107046	107080	107081	107081	Heidi	87	“ You ’re a sad little putt slut who snagged herself a pro golfer and now will do anything to keep him . He ’s finally seen you for who you really are , ”
107084	107110	107081	107081	Heidi	87	“ And you can insult me all you like , but you ’re never going to get him back . Not with your winning personality . ”
107111	107115	107116	107116	Miranda	172	“ Fucking bitch , ”
107119	107129	107116	107116	Miranda	172	“ You do n’t know what you ’re saying . ”
107130	107134	107135	107135	I	0	“ She does , ”
107209	107214	107215	107215	I	0	“ You should go , ”
107219	107226	107215	107215	I	0	“ You ’re not wanted here . ”
107227	107244	107245	107245	Jensen	79	“ Fuck all of you fucking Wrights . I ’ll take the scandal to the press ! ”
107250	107266	107247	107247	his	79	“ I bought out your PI . I do n’t think that will be happening . ”
107267	107288	107289	107289	Morgan	143	“ Yeah , it was n’t even that hard to track down when I knew what I was looking for , ”
107310	107321	107294	107294	her	172	“ So , you can go bye - bye now . ”
107335	107348	107322	107322	Miranda	172	“ God , I am so glad that I got that abortion . ”
107374	107379	107370	107370	she	172	“ You … what ? ”
107380	107419	107420	107420	Miranda	172	“ Yeah . You fucking thought I miscarried ? No , I just did n’t want to have your fucking kid and have it grow up and be a Wright . So , I got rid of it , ”
107495	107501	107502	107502	I	0	“ Get the fuck out , ”
107510	107514	107502	107502	I	0	“ Right now . ”
107615	107624	107625	107625	she	172	“ Hey , that ’s not your fault , ”
107629	107636	107625	107625	she	172	“ She killed our unborn child . ”
107637	107641	107642	107642	she	172	“ I know , ”
107645	107654	107642	107642	she	172	“ And nothing could ever make that right . ”
107655	107661	107670	107670	Her	172	“ She actually did it . ”
107662	107666	107667	107667	she	172	“ I know , ”
107684	107699	107670	107670	Her	172	“ But … but I ’m here , Landon . If you need me . ”
107739	107746	107731	107731	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe it . ”
107747	107797	107798	107798	Heidi	87	“ I think it explains a lot about her behavior . The way she ’s always acted so jealous and angry . When you first told me she had the miscarriage , I thought her actions were from guilt that she might not be able to have a child , ”
107801	107846	107798	107798	Heidi	87	“ Now , I see it ’s guilt because she got rid of the one you wanted and lied about it . The fact that she wielded the news like a weapon just showed how desperate she was . She wants to hurt you . ”
107847	107851	107852	107852	I	0	“ It worked , ”
107855	107861	107862	107862	Heidi	87	“ How could it not ? ”
107865	107913	107862	107862	Heidi	87	“ What she did was despicable . Going behind your back and lying and then making you cater to her for so long about something that was n’t even true . She ’s just crazy . Are n’t you a little glad a child is n’t involved ? ”
107992	107999	108000	108000	Morgan	143	“ God , what a bitch ! ”
108003	108017	108000	108000	Morgan	143	“ I mean … phew ! You picked a real winner , Landon . ”
108018	108023	108024	108024	I	0	“ Thanks , Morgan , ”
108031	108057	108024	108024	I	0	“ She sure knows how to put on a show though . And , seriously , I would n’t take anything she said to heart . ”
108065	108102	108058	108058	She	172	“ At this point , she would do anything to hurt you — lie , cheat , steal , hire a private investigator to get your girlfriend fired . You know , totally normal psychotic behavior . ”
108112	108128	108109	108109	I	0	“ Well , there ’s one good thing that came out of all of this . ”
108129	108132	108133	108133	Heidi	87	“ Yeah ? ”
108136	108144	108133	108133	Heidi	87	“ You ’re talking to me again . ”
108145	108154	108155	108155	Morgan	143	“ Um … yes , that ’s great , ”
108158	108201	108155	108155	Morgan	143	“ however , I have to say that the best part is that when Jensen escorted her out , he threatened her within an inch of her life . I ’m pretty sure we ’ll have the signed divorce paperwork by tomorrow . ”
108293	108307	108308	108308	I	0	“ You know that I am totally in love with you , right ? ”
108314	108323	108311	108311	She	172	“ Yeah , I think I noticed that . ”
108324	108382	108383	108383	She	172	“ I do n’t want us to be apart . I do n’t want what happened here or with our jobs to pull us apart . I ’ll really quit this time , Heidi . I ’ll get you your job back , and we ’ll make this work . It ’s not worth not having you . ”
108388	108467	108383	108383	She	172	“ Look , I did n’t want to break up with you . I want us to be together . That ’s what I ’ve wanted for so long . I just blamed you for everything . And , sure , it was Miranda ’s fault , and we both could have been more careful , but we should have worked through this together . I ’m sure that ’s why Emery and Julia insisted I come here . ”
108468	108499	108500	108500	I	0	“ I would love to make this work as a team . I do n’t want to go through life , wondering about what - ifs . I want you . ”
108536	108548	108549	108549	Jensen	79	“ Ladies and gentlemen , if I could have your attention , ”
108555	108610	108549	108549	Jensen	79	“ I ’m Jensen Wright , the CEO of Wright Construction , and I wanted to thank everyone for coming out tonight for our annual Charity Benefit . I hope you ’re losing all of your money at the tables , so we can donate an enormous check to the Lubbock Children ’s Hospital ! ”
108627	108694	108695	108695	My	0	“ While I have your attention , I have a special announcement . Wright Construction has recently opened a new division of the company where a percentage of all proceeds will go to our partnership with Lubbock Children ’s Hospital . We ’ll be opening Wright Golf Club , a PGA - style golf course focused on teaching the beginner to bringing the professionals in town . ”

108888	108893	108894	108894	I	0	“ Did you know ? ”
108898	108943	108878	108878	Emery	80	“ I had an idea about it , but I think it was a glimmer of an idea . I was n’t sure , and I did n’t want to say anything if you did n’t know . Especially if Landon did n’t know . ”
108944	108974	109039	109039	her	80	“ I ’m so happy for him . This is where his heart is . I think he eventually would have died from working in an office every day . ”
108975	108981	108982	108982	Emery	80	“ You ’re probably right , ”
108985	108994	108982	108982	Emery	80	“ So … aren’t you glad you came ? ”
108995	109004	109039	109039	her	80	“ Is this why you lied to me ? ”
109005	109036	109037	109037	Emery	80	“ Jensen told me I had to get you here , no matter what . So , I did . And I ’m so glad that I did , too . ”
109044	109048	109039	109039	her	80	“ Speaking of . ”
109063	109066	109067	109067	he	79	“ Heidi , ”
109074	109077	109078	109078	I	0	“ Hey , ”
109081	109092	109078	109078	I	0	“ Um … sorry about that text the other day . ”
109093	109101	109039	109039	her	80	“ Forgiven . I probably deserved it . ”

109115	109178	109078	109078	I	0	“ He ’s my brother . I love him , and I want to see him happy . I knew he ’d never really be happy at Wright . He might have the business degree , but he belongs on the course . And I wanted to give him something that would actually keep him occupied until he could get back out . ”

109218	109293	109215	109215	He	2078	“ I imagine not . Had you answered your phone though , I would have told you about what I had in the works for Landon . I wanted it to be a surprise for him . When he told me he was dating someone , I never guessed it was you , so I ignored the problem . I deeply apologize for that error and how it resulted in you losing your job . ”
109294	109313	109372	109372	He	2079	“ Oh , yeah … getting fired . Pretty much one of the worst days of my life . ”

109462	109524	109456	109456	he	2079	“ We ’ve had your boss and Julia sign an NDA where they would be liable if they disclosed the information they had found in that email . That means that the only people left who know about the videos are you and my family . I would never want to place you in a position where you would be uncomfortable . ”
109525	109534	109535	109535	I	0	“ And I would … keep my promotion ? ”
109548	109556	109535	109535	I	0	“ I do n’t see why not . ”

109570	109599	109564	109564	I	0	“ No catch . What happened was a mistake . Losing you would be a huge loss to the company . We really want you back , Heidi . ”
