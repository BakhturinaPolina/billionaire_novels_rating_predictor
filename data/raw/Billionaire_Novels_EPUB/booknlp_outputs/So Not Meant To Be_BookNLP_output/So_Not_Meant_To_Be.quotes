316	341	342	343	JP Cane	87	“ Kelsey , it ’s a known fact men and women ca n’t have a working relationship and be friends at the same time . ”
385	394	395	395	I	0	“ What on earth are you talking about ? ”
427	449	414	414	he	87	“ The other night , when we were having dinner with Huxley and Lottie , you said we could be friends . ”
674	681	682	682	JP	87	“ Do you have a rebuttal ? ”
710	733	699	699	I	0	“ First of all , we were n’t having dinner together with Huxley and Lottie . It was n’t a double date — ”
734	740	741	741	he	87	“ Jesus , I know , ”
746	758	759	759	He	87	“ You made that very clear three and a half times . ”
769	849	759	759	He	87	“ When we rang the doorbell , because we happened to arrive at the same time . When we were in the kitchen , both reaching for the same champagne . Outside by the pool when we happened to get left at the table alone . And in the living room , you were midway through telling me we were n’t on a double date when Lottie interrupted you to show you a new ‘ toy ’ she got . ”
861	872	850	850	He	87	“ Still waiting on the details of the new toy . ”
873	879	880	880	I	0	“ And secondly . . . ”
910	920	902	902	I	0	“ Why on earth ca n’t we be friends ? ”
921	927	928	928	I	0	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
958	968	950	950	I	0	“ No . No , it ’s not obvious . ”
989	1002	971	971	his	87	“ Because , Kelsey , there ’s a palpable attraction between us . ”
1298	1309	1310	1310	I	0	“ You really think there ’s an attraction between us ? ”
1313	1339	1310	1310	I	0	“ Babe , I can smell the sexual chemistry , and because it ’s so palpable , so thick , so . . . musky — ”
1340	1348	1392	1392	he	87	“ Eww , it ’s not musky . ”
1403	1429	1392	1392	he	87	“ We ca n’t possibly be work friends because the attraction between us will always and forever put the thought of sex on the table . ”
1487	1511	1484	1484	I	0	“ Are you feverish ? Is that what ’s happening ? You ’ve come down with something and this is how you act ? ”
1512	1531	1484	1484	I	0	“ I ’m a specimen of health . You should know that . You check me out enough . ”
1532	1537	1538	1538	I	0	“ I do not . ”
1567	1580	1554	1554	He	87	“ Why do you think my sleeves are rolled up right now ? ”
1635	1646	1630	1630	He	87	“ Because I know how much they turn you on . ”
1663	1678	1647	1647	I	0	“ Do you understand how massively inappropriate this is ? I ’m your employee . ”
1679	1696	1711	1711	his	87	“ Technically , you ’re Huxley ’s employee , I ’m just the overseer of things . ”
1697	1704	1705	1705	He	87	“ Is that the professional term ? ”
1713	1717	1705	1705	He	87	“ It is . ”
1748	1763	1736	1736	I	0	“ Not sure why you ’re getting all flustered and red in the face . ”
1764	1770	1771	1771	I	0	“ I ’m not flustered . ”
1779	1816	1771	1771	I	0	“ I ’m trying to be an honest do - gooder right now , attempting to educate you on why we ca n’t be friends . I should be praised , not disparaged with your sneer . ”
1837	1911	1822	1822	he	87	“ A man and a woman who find each other attractive and who work together will never be able to be friends . There will always be a giant elephant in the room , and that elephant ’s name is Sex . It ’s basic human math , Kelsey . We all need to climax , and when we find someone who ’s attractive , we want that person to help us climax . ”
2064	2112	2057	2057	I	0	“ What the hell happened to make you like this ? I asked you what you thought about bamboo filing cabinets and it turned into this argument about why we ca n’t be friends . I do n’t see how this conversation is relevant to my question . ”
2113	2118	2119	2119	he	87	“ It ’s relevant , ”
2134	2187	2119	2119	he	87	“ because when your hungry eyes are devouring me from across the conference table but your attitude is attempting to put me in the friend zone , I ’m going to call you out on it . You said you want to be friends , but that ’s not going to happen . ”
2218	2276	2208	2208	I	0	“ Trust me , JP , if I found you the least bit attractive , you ’d know it . What you ’re believing are hungry eyes for you , is a ravenous woman who had one waffle slathered in peanut butter at six this morning . Hunger hallucination has set in , and your meager body — ”
2277	2282	2208	2208	I	0	“ Meager ? Pfft . ”
2283	2332	2333	2333	His	87	“ — has morphed into a giant meatball sub in my mind , nothing more . Convince yourself all you want about what you assume is my attraction toward you , but from my mouth to your headstrong ears , I could n’t find you any more revolting . ”
2362	2396	2397	2397	He	87	“ And if I had any romantic inkling toward you , I would n’t be wearing this simple , almost homely blouse that does nothing to show off my perfect , bouncy breasts . ”
2414	2448	2402	2402	he	87	“ And I would n’t be wearing underwear , either , on the off chance that you pulled me on top of this conference table and spread my legs for a small taste . ”
2455	2527	2528	2528	He	87	“ And I sure as hell would n’t be mentally pleading for this conversation to end so I can pack up and retreat to my studio apartment to eat dinner peacefully alone without an imperious imbecile like yourself chirping in my ear about work relationships . Because , JP , if I wanted you , I would want to steal , consume , and savor every second I had with you . ”
2543	2552	2528	2528	He	87	“ But that ’s not the case here . ”
2558	2569	2553	2553	I	0	“ I ca n’t get away from you fast enough . ”
2600	2641	2587	2587	he	87	“ Now that we ’ve cleared that up , I ’ll leave since we ’re getting nothing done here and a meatball sub is calling my name . I ’m going to assume you approve of the bamboo filing cabinets . ”
2662	2670	2671	2671	he	87	“ We still ca n’t be friends , ”
2701	2752	2753	2753	I	0	“ Good . When I said that the other night , I was just attempting to be kind , you know , since your company hired mine , but now that our feelings are out in the open , we can live our lives without this fake , bullshit friendship . ”
2780	2801	2802	2802	I	0	“ Now , if you do n’t mind , I have an appointment to stuff my mouth full of meat . ”
2875	2915	2861	2861	he	87	“ The only bullshit thing between us is that spiel you just laid out . Deny it all you want , but I know you want me . The quicker you accept that , the better you will feel . ”
2956	2976	2953	2953	I	0	“ The sooner you realize I ’m out of your league . . . the better you will feel . ”
4173	4201	4202	4202	Lottie	89	“ Can you two stop making out ? Honestly , I came here to have dinner with you , not see you lick each other ’s faces . ”
4210	4222	4202	4202	Lottie	89	“ But he smells so good . Have you smelled him ? ”
4223	4235	4236	4236	Huxley	90	“ I have n’t , because he ’s not my boyfriend . ”
4256	4267	4268	4268	He	405	“ I ’m going to go check on the pizza . ”
4281	4294	4268	4268	He	405	“ Kelse , can I get you a refill on your drink ? ”
4305	4311	4295	4295	I	0	“ Please , thank you . ”
4436	4450	4429	4429	Lottie	89	“ Kelsey , you know that vibrator I showed you the other night ? ”
4451	4454	4455	4455	She	89	“ Yes ? ”
4469	4501	4455	4455	She	89	“ I blacked out . He legit had to shake me back to consciousness . He wo n’t use it on me anymore even though I ’m begging desperately for it . ”
4510	4522	4507	4507	I	0	“ Is n’t that lovely . Congratulations on the intense orgasm . ”
4529	4538	4523	4523	Lottie	89	“ Hey , am I sensing some sarcasm ? ”
4539	4545	4546	4546	I	0	“ What clued you in ? ”
4565	4578	4523	4523	Lottie	89	“ Uh , the attitude . What the hell is going on ? ”
4591	4619	4581	4581	I	0	“ I ’m very happy for you and Huxley and your love , but I ’m the perpetually single one , and it ’s hard to watch . ”
4620	4625	4626	4626	she	89	“ Are you jealous ? ”
4629	4632	4633	4633	I	0	“ Yes , ”
4663	4690	4650	4650	I	0	“ I ’m very jealous that you have this consuming relationship with a man who worships you , and I do n’t even have one prospect . ”
4691	4697	4698	4698	Lottie	89	“ That ’s not true , ”
4712	4717	4701	4701	Huxley	90	“ What about JP ? ”
4718	4723	4724	4724	I	0	“ Oh , please , ”
4734	4751	4732	4732	Huxley	90	“ No offense to you since he ’s your brother , but JP is a moron . ”
4752	4762	4763	4763	Huxley	90	“ No offense taken . I agree with you , ”
4787	4794	4795	4795	Lottie	89	“ How is he a moron ? ”
4798	4803	4804	4804	Huxley	90	“ Where to start ? ”
4926	4938	4939	4939	Lottie	89	“ JP is fun , the kind of fun you need , ”
4942	4956	4939	4939	Lottie	89	“ I love you , Kelse , but you ’re a bit uptight . ”
4957	4963	4964	4964	I	0	“ I am not uptight , ”
4967	5014	4964	4964	I	0	“ I just know what I like and what I do n’t like , and trust me when I say I do n’t like JP . He ’s annoying and thinks too highly of himself and , frankly , he ’s far too messy for me . ”
5015	5019	5020	5020	Huxley	90	“ All facts , ”
5023	5028	5020	5020	Huxley	90	“ Kelsey deserves better . ”
5029	5035	5036	5036	Lottie	89	“ That ’s your brother , ”
5039	5059	5036	5036	Lottie	89	“ I ’m aware , babe . But I agree with Kelsey . They are n’t a good match . ”
5060	5064	5065	5065	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
5070	5105	5065	5065	I	0	“ And since we ’re on the topic , I ’ll let you know I ’m thinking about joining that local dating app . You know , the one with the blind date restaurant ? ”
5106	5135	5036	5036	Lottie	89	“ Wait , the one that Noely Clark from Good Morning , Malibu has boasted about ? The one where she found love ? What ’s it called ? ”
5136	5141	5142	5142	I	0	“ Going in Blind , ”
5145	5148	5142	5142	I	0	“ Yes . ”
5156	5172	5151	5151	her	89	“ Oh my God , did n’t you interview her and Jack on your podcast ? ”
5176	5218	5151	5151	her	89	“ Yes , that ’s where I got the idea . She was telling me all about it while we were n’t recording , and it seems really interesting . Like , maybe I could actually find someone like - minded . ”
5219	5225	5226	5226	Huxley	90	“ How does it work ? ”
5229	5312	5226	5226	Huxley	90	“ It ’s all anonymous through an app , but everyone is put through a background check and screened to make sure there ’s no catfishing . Then , the app matches you with people . You do n’t know who the person is by name or what they look like , and you meet up at the restaurant , Going in Blind , where you share a meal together and see if you ’re a match . Like a blind date . ”
5313	5319	5320	5320	Huxley	90	“ That ’s pretty neat , ”
5323	5328	5329	5329	Lottie	89	“ I love it , ”
5332	5350	5329	5329	Lottie	89	“ God , I should ’ve thought of that when I was trolling for a rich husband . ”
5361	5371	5358	5358	he	420	“ I think you did pretty good for yourself . ”
5384	5396	5372	5372	Lottie	89	“ I did decent , though you can be quite grumpy . ”
5699	5709	5710	5710	I	0	“ Oh God , I feel like throwing up , ”
5721	5732	5710	5710	I	0	“ Why did I think this was a good idea ? ”
5733	5743	5749	5749	she	89	“ Because you want to be in a relationship , ”
5758	5762	5749	5749	she	89	“ I do . ”
5790	5800	5783	5783	I	0	“ I really want to be in a relationship . ”
5801	5841	5763	5763	I	0	“ And you yourself said this guy sounds nice . Likes dogs , has his own business — something you have in common — and has a secret desire to be in a boy band , which is charming . ”
5842	5846	5847	5847	I	0	“ It is . ”
5856	5865	5847	5847	I	0	“ The boy band thing really got me . ”
5866	5875	5763	5763	I	0	“ And what was his favorite quote again ? ”
5876	5886	5887	5887	I	0	“ ‘ Buzz , your girlfriend ! Woof ! ’ ”
5907	5919	5903	5903	Lottie	89	“ See , he seems like a good time as well . ”
5928	5936	5921	5921	I	0	“ What if he ’s the one ? ”
5937	5985	5986	5986	I	0	“ Okay , you ca n’t go into this thinking like that . You need to be calm , composed , and just have fun . You ca n’t go all crazy romantic on him and ask him to have your babies fifteen minutes into the date . ”
5993	6000	5986	5986	I	0	“ I would never do that . ”
6001	6024	6025	6025	I	0	“ Just checking , because earlier you asked me if purple accented your elbow pit veins too much . Who asks that ? ”
6034	6063	6025	6025	I	0	“ Mom gave me these veins , and they are far too prominent . I do n’t need the purple of this dress making them even more prominent . ”
6064	6095	6096	6096	I	0	“ With the way that dress makes your boobs look , I ’m pretty sure the last thing he ’s going to be looking at is your inner elbow veins . ”
6101	6116	6096	6096	I	0	“ Oh my God , do I look like I ’m trying too hard ? ”
6117	6120	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ Noooo , ”
6124	6157	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ You look perfect . Now , if you do n’t leave soon , you ’re going to be late and I know what you hate most in life is being late . ”
6158	6204	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ That ’s true . Being late just means you ’re either a ‘ time bender’—that ’s a real thing — or you do n’t care about other people ’s time . And time is the one thing in life you ca n’t get back . ”
6205	6211	6212	6212	Lottie	89	“ Yes , I know . ”
6241	6286	6232	6232	I	0	“ What if this is it , if he ’s the one ? I ’m going to start sweating when I see him . I wo n’t be able to act cool . What if this is my one and only chance at love ? ”
6287	6318	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ This is not your one and only chance . This is a blind date with a guy that some computer algorithm thought would be a good fit for you . ”
6319	6346	6232	6232	I	0	“ A proven algorithm . The success rate is as high as ninety percent . Do you know what kind of pressure that puts on me ? ”
6347	6360	6232	6232	I	0	“ You ’re overthinking this . It ’s supposed to be fun . ”
6361	6387	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ Nothing about dating is fun . You lucked out with Huxley . Maybe I should walk a rich neighborhood , looking for a husband . ”
6388	6400	6232	6232	I	0	“ Or you could just go out with JP . . . ”
6417	6442	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ By now you should know I have zero interest in him . I ’d have better luck dating a houseplant than JP Cane . Now”—I
6446	6461	6121	6121	Lottie	89	dress—“if you will excuse me , I have a blind date to go on . ”
6462	6477	6121	6121	Lottie	89	“ One mention of JP and you ’re all fixed and ready to go ? ”
6478	6481	6482	6482	I	0	“ Yes . ”
6494	6519	6482	6482	I	0	“ Because if there ’s one thing I know for sure , it ’s that any date is better than a date with him . ”
6523	6531	6532	6532	I	0	“ I truly , truly hate you , ”
6544	6555	6532	6532	I	0	“ Do you hate me or do you hate yourself ? ”
6559	6570	6556	6556	Breaker	97	“ Because you ’re the one who lost the bet . ”
6571	6603	6522	6522	JP	87	“ My shoe was untied , I called a time - out , you did n’t listen , you scored the winning basket , and basically . . . you cheated . ”
6604	6607	6608	6608	Breaker	97	“ Jesus , ”
6611	6651	6608	6608	Breaker	97	“ What a load of crap and you know it . You did n’t call a time - out until I juked you , you lunged , and I blew past you . I beat you fair and square . ”
6664	6672	6657	6657	I	0	“ Well , we needed a replay . ”
6673	6696	6522	6522	JP	87	“ Why do n’t you act like a man , own up to your loss , and take the consequences without complaining ? ”
6697	6707	6657	6657	I	0	“ Because I do n’t want to do this . ”
6708	6718	6657	6657	I	0	“ Then you never should ’ve placed the bet . ”
6719	6736	6737	6737	He	97	“ Yeah , well . . . I did n’t think I was going to lose . ”
6743	6748	6737	6737	He	97	“ Not my problem . ”
6749	6756	6757	6757	I	0	“ Fuck . . . fine . ”
6765	6772	6757	6757	I	0	“ But this is fucking stupid . ”
6773	6808	6737	6737	He	97	“ Let me ask you this — are you mad because you lost , or are you mad because you ’re going on a date that is n’t with the apple of your eye ? ”
6809	6818	6819	6819	Breaker	97	“ There ’s no apple of my eye . ”
6822	6849	6819	6819	Breaker	97	“ Dude , you ’re not fooling anyone . You ’re infatuated with Kelsey and it bothers you that she wants nothing to do with you . ”
6850	6853	6854	6854	I	0	“ Kelsey ? ”
6884	6913	6871	6871	I	0	“ Kelsey is a pill . She ’s uptight , annoying , and does n’t know a good thing when it ’s standing right in front of her . ”
6914	6918	6919	6919	Breaker	97	“ Meaning you , ”
6928	6962	6922	6922	his	97	“ Uh , yeah , clearly . Why would I want to go on a date with someone who thinks more highly of a piece of gum stuck on her shoe than me ? ”
6963	6982	6922	6922	his	97	“ Hmm , maybe I should ask Kelsey out . We seem to have a lot in common . ”
6983	6990	6991	6991	I	0	“ Fuck . . . off , ”
7045	7058	7036	7036	I	0	“ This was really stupid . I know nothing about this girl . ”
7059	7091	7008	7008	she	89	“ Not true . You know that she lives here , that she owns her own business , and that she believes roses are the most romantic flower in the world . ”
7092	7143	7021	7021	she	89	“ Yeah , exactly . Why this fucking computer thought we ’d be a match , I have no idea . It probably saw business owner on our profiles and was like , done . Easy . Match made in heaven . This place is over - hyped and ridiculous . ”
7144	7164	7036	7036	I	0	“ It ’s not like you have to stay that long . Just go have a drink and then — ”
7165	7192	7193	7193	Breaker	97	“ That ’s not how this process works . You have to stay and have a meal with the person . It ’s the godforsaken program . ”
7196	7202	7193	7193	Breaker	97	“ Oh shit , really ? ”
7203	7233	7036	7036	I	0	“ Yes , really . Something about how they want you to get to know the person before making a snap judgment and moving on to the next date . ”
7234	7238	7036	7036	I	0	“ Makes sense . ”
7239	7254	7193	7193	Breaker	97	“ Yeah , for someone who does n’t have to go on the date . ”
7255	7273	7036	7036	I	0	“ Dude , stop bitching and just go in there . Jesus , are n’t you late ? ”
7293	7298	7287	7287	I	0	“ I hate you . ”
7299	7315	7036	7036	I	0	“ Ca n’t wait to hear all about the date . Have fun , bro . ”
7316	7320	7321	7321	I	0	“ Fuck off . ”
7606	7612	7613	7615	the ebullient hostess	453	“ Good evening , sir , ”
7618	7624	7613	7615	the ebullient hostess	453	“ You must be JP . ”
7659	7665	7656	7656	I	0	“ That would be me . ”
7666	7691	7692	7692	I	0	“ Wonderful . Well , your date is at the bar . Shall I introduce you , or would you like to introduce yourself ? ”
7741	7747	7781	7781	they	459	“ I can introduce myself . ”
7748	7756	7781	7781	they	459	“ Wonderful . Have a nice evening . ”
7757	7761	7762	7762	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
7830	7838	7839	7839	I	0	“ Hello , you must be RosesAreRed , ”
7942	7951	7952	7952	she	460	“ What the hell are you doing here ? ”
7983	7992	7979	7979	I	0	“ I ’m your date for the evening . ”
8013	8065	7998	7998	she	460	“ Are you some sort of stalker who followed me here ? JP , this is going way too freaking far . I ’m about to go on a date with someone . I do n’t want him thinking I ’m here with you , so if you ’d please leave — ”
8066	8069	8070	8070	I	0	“ ManWearsPants , ”
8101	8109	8098	8098	she	460	“ Why did you just say that ? ”
8146	8184	8197	8197	her	460	“ That ’s my avatar . ManWearsPants , and you , my irritated shrew , are RosesAreRed , and you can deny it all you want , but this dating program thinks we ’re the perfect match . ”
8185	8193	8197	8197	her	460	“ Well , clearly it was wrong . ”
8235	8268	8230	8230	I	0	“ Excuse me , Miss Irritable , but I believe we are n’t allowed to leave the restaurant until we share a meal together . It ’s in the terms and conditions . ”
8275	8282	8269	8269	Her	460	“ You ca n’t be serious . ”
8283	8307	8308	8308	I	0	“ Oh , I ’m very serious . I believe it ’s section three , line five where it states the definitive guidelines , ”
8311	8329	8308	8308	I	0	“ I signed up for this dating app , and I expect to get the full experience . ”
8344	8349	8350	8351	the hostess	463	“ Everything okay here ? ”
8359	8364	8365	8365	I	0	“ Everything is great , ”
8368	8376	8377	8377	Kelsey	86	“ No , everything is not great , ”
8380	8419	8377	8377	Kelsey	86	“ There must have been some mistake with the algorithm and the matching , because I know this man , and let me tell you , I can say with full confidence that we ’re not a match . ”
8420	8438	8472	8472	her	463	“ Oh , how interesting . I do n’t think we ’ve ever had this happen before . ”
8439	8468	8472	8472	her	463	“ Ah , wonderful . So you can imagine how we ’d just like to move on from this ill - fated inconvenience and go on our way . ”
8496	8522	8472	8472	her	463	“ I ’m so sorry , but unfortunately , you have to stay and enjoy a meal together . It ’s part of the terms . ”
8523	8531	8532	8532	Kelsey	86	“ But I said I know him . ”
8553	8576	8535	8535	her	86	“ And I do n’t like him . I do n’t need to have a meal with him to figure that out . ”
8577	8582	8583	8583	I	0	“ You wound me , ”
8612	8650	8599	8599	her	86	“ Do you see what I ’m dealing with ? Trust me , you do n’t want us sharing a meal together , it ’ll distract the other people around us . All we do is bicker . ”
8651	8668	8669	8670	The hostess	463	“ Then we ’ll give you one of our new private tables in the loft area . ”
8682	8687	8669	8670	The hostess	463	“ Right this way . ”
8688	8695	8696	8696	Kelsey	86	“ You ca n’t be serious , ”
8699	8706	8707	8707	I	0	“ Looks like she is serious , ”
8722	8735	8707	8707	I	0	“ You ’re really going to make me have dinner with him ? ”
8793	8807	8808	8808	We	470	“ This is ridiculous . I should n’t be held against my will . ”
8814	8840	8808	8808	We	470	“ This program is a load of crock if you think I should be matched with JP . Did you even do a background check ? ”
8953	8970	8971	8971	she	86	“ There ’s nothing romantic between us , nothing at all . Why is this happening ? ”
8988	8993	8971	8971	she	86	“ Unplug and be present ”
9042	9071	9035	9035	she	86	“ What if I have an important phone call that comes in ? What if I need my sister to fake a broken ankle so I can leave ? ”
9148	9172	9173	9174	the hostess	463	“ Your server ’s name is Helix . He ’ll be joining you shortly . Please let us know if you need anything , ”
9184	9204	9205	9205	Kelsey	86	“ Yes , I need to get out of this date . How can you assist me in that ? ”
9208	9223	9205	9205	Kelsey	86	“ I ’m sure you two will have a beautiful evening together . Enjoy . ”
9299	9314	9293	9293	she	86	“ You did this . You planned this whole thing , did n’t you ? ”
9315	9367	9282	9282	her	86	“ What ? You ’ve lost your mind if you think I have time in my day to figure out what kind of cheesy dating app you ’re on , infiltrate the app , and then somehow compromise the system so you and I are forced to have a date together . ”
9368	9373	9374	9374	She	86	“ I knew it . ”
9382	9414	9376	9376	her	86	“ God , and you play the fool so well , when in reality , you ’re a conniving birdbrain with nothing better to do than provoke people in your path . ”
9439	9478	9415	9415	I	0	“ Firstly , I said I did n’t have time to do all that . Secondly , conniving birdbrain is an insult I ’m going to have to store away for later . It ’s a good one . ”
9479	9491	9492	9492	She	86	“ Eww , do n’t try to be charming with me . ”
9526	9532	9513	9513	her	86	“ What a wasted room . ”
9556	9575	9550	9550	I	0	“ You know , you could try to make the most of this and attempt to be pleasant . ”
9582	9602	9603	9603	Touché	107	“ Why , JP ? I thought men and women who work with each other ca n’t be friends . ”
9605	9626	9603	9603	Touché	107	“ Not saying we have to be friends , but you could at least not act like an uninspiring wench . ”
9627	9639	9693	9693	he	106	“ Do you expect me to have a conversation with you ? ”
9640	9666	9603	9603	Touché	107	“ That ’s what normal people usually do when they share a meal together . Unless there ’s a new trend I ’m unaware of . ”
9703	9722	9693	9693	he	106	“ Good evening . Our hostess has informed me that we have a happy love nest up here . ”
9770	9804	9693	9693	he	106	“ We ’re in a bit of a rush , so if you do n’t mind , we ’d like to order , eat , and then get the hell out of here . ”
9805	9808	9809	9809	I	0	“ Jesus , ”
9812	9821	9809	9809	I	0	“ Do n’t be rude to the guy . ”
9835	9845	9846	9846	Helix	106	“ I ’m sorry . Helix , is it ? ”
9849	9908	9846	9846	Helix	106	“ You see , when I signed up for this app , I was under the impression that I ’d be set up with someone I might actually be interested in . I had all the hope of meeting someone interesting , someone complex , someone fun . I was truly planning on making a deep connection tonight . ”
9915	9932	9909	9909	Her	86	“ And when I say deep connection , I mean mentally . . . not physically . ”
9937	10017	9933	9933	I	0	“ But you see , Helix , instead of meeting someone who could have the potential to sweep me off my feet , I was matched with this insolent , vexatious human who thinks more highly of the hangnail on his finger than the people around him . Unfortunately , I work with him and I know enough about him to understand that there ’s nothing — and I mean absolutely nothing — we have in common . Therefore — ”
10018	10030	10031	10031	Helix	106	“ That ’s not what the readout on your profiles says . ”
10040	10044	10037	10037	Kelsey	86	“ Excuse me ? ”
10045	10086	9933	9933	I	0	“ I heard there might be some trouble up here in paradise , and sometimes , when that happens , we print out the reason the computer connected you both . Would you like me to read it to you ? ”
10087	10090	10091	10091	Kelsey	86	“ No , ”
10094	10097	10098	10098	I	0	“ Yes , ”
10105	10124	10098	10098	I	0	“ I would love nothing more than to hear why Kelsey and I are suited for each other . ”
10178	10199	10175	10175	his	492	“ You were one of our highest matches in the system with a ninety - seven percent probable success rate . ”
10219	10224	10225	10225	Helix	106	“ RosesAreRed and ManWearsPants . ”
10230	10238	10225	10225	Helix	106	“ Great name , by the way . ”
10244	10248	10239	10239	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
10249	10254	10255	10255	Kelsey	86	“ Oh my God , ”
10258	10268	10255	10255	Kelsey	86	“ There ’s absolutely no imagination to that name . ”
10269	10278	10279	10279	I	0	“ As if RosesAreRed is a poetic masterpiece , ”
10282	10291	10279	10279	I	0	“ Might as well have called yourself PointsOutTheObvious . ”
10303	10313	10301	10301	Helix	106	“ See what I ’m talking about ? Insufferable . ”
10327	10341	10318	10318	Helix	106	“ RosesAreRed and ManWearsPants are both business owners within the Los Angeles area . ”
10342	10353	10354	10354	Kelsey	86	“ Whoa , that ’s a surprise to no one . ”
10427	10441	10442	10442	Kelsey	86	“ From reviewing their backgrounds , we ’ve established likeness in parent abandonment . ”
10446	10470	10442	10442	Kelsey	86	“ The desire to achieve , and a direct match in fears such as failure , not being loved , and being alone . ”
10513	10555	10556	10556	Helix	106	“ It also determined that where RosesAreRed is very structured and amorous in thought , ManWearsPants can be pessimistic with an apathetic attitude , making these two puzzle pieces fit closely together , creating a continuous balance for a healthy relationship . ”
10573	10585	10556	10556	Helix	106	“ Now , what can I get you two for dinner ? ”
10675	10677	10687	10688	Bad Guy	108	“ dates ”
10770	10781	10782	10782	I	0	“ So . . . do you often eat meatloaf ? ”
10872	10880	11002	11002	He	87	“ Are you attempting conversation with me ? ”
10881	10899	11002	11002	He	87	“ You ca n’t possibly expect me to sit here in silence for God knows how long . ”
10900	10917	10966	10966	he	87	“ I do n’t know , watching you squirm from a lack of conversation seems enjoyable . ”
10918	10925	11002	11002	He	87	“ Why are you an ass ? ”
10926	10965	10966	10966	he	87	“ Could n’t you tell from the rundown Helix just gave us ? Abandonment issues and false façades are high on that list for defense mechanisms . Does n’t take a psychologist to figure that out , babe , ”
10969	11001	10966	10966	he	87	“ Does n’t give you an excuse to act like an asshole . I grew up without a dad and you do n’t see me parading around with an indignant attitude . ”
11011	11036	11002	11002	He	87	“ Did you completely forget the ‘ I hate JP Cane ’ one - person show you just put on for the restaurant staff ? ”
11037	11071	11002	11002	He	87	“ Well , pardon me for being flummoxed when I found out you were my date for the evening . In my head , I was picturing this night going a tad differently . ”
11072	11084	11085	11085	I	0	“ I see . And how did you picture it going ? ”
11093	11098	11085	11085	I	0	“ Not like this . ”
11099	11131	11002	11002	He	87	“ You said that , and given we have a long dinner in front of us , why do n’t you educate me on how you thought tonight would pan out ? ”
11132	11151	11002	11002	He	87	“ I ’m not sharing that with you . You ’re just going to make fun of me . ”
11152	11159	11085	11085	I	0	“ Why would I do that ? ”
11160	11171	11002	11002	He	87	“ Because you ’re an oppressor of hopes and dreams . ”
11172	11181	11182	11182	I	0	“ How little you know me , Kelsey . ”
11193	11216	11182	11182	I	0	“ So if I tell you what I thought would happen tonight , you ’re not going to make fun of me ? ”
11217	11243	11002	11002	He	87	“ You know , it might behoove you to get to know me . Then you might not have such a low opinion of me . ”
11246	11249	11250	11250	I	0	“ Fine , ”
11257	11275	11250	11250	I	0	“ But if you make fun of me , I ’m throwing my water in your face . ”
11276	11281	11282	11282	He	498	“ That ’s fair . ”
11287	11298	11282	11282	He	498	“ Go ahead , light me up with your fantasies . ”
11313	11333	11310	11310	I	0	“ Well , I signed up for this program because I heard great things about it from Noely Clark . ”
11334	11347	11348	11348	he	498	“ Noely , one of the hosts from Good Morning , Malibu ? ”
11351	11364	11348	11348	he	498	“ Yes . I interviewed her and her husband for my podcast — ”
11365	11376	11310	11310	I	0	“ You have a podcast ? What ’s it called ? ”
11392	11411	11389	11389	I	0	“ I do , and the name is irrelevant . I would rather you not listen to it . ”
11412	11423	11389	11389	I	0	“ Afraid I might become a long - time listener ? ”
11424	11430	11431	11431	I	0	“ Are you teasing me ? ”
11446	11457	11438	11438	He	498	“ No , not teasing . Just engaging in conversation . ”
11458	11469	11389	11389	I	0	“ Try using less sarcasm in your ‘ engagements . ’ ”
11470	11473	11474	11474	He	498	“ Noted . ”
11480	11483	11477	11477	his	498	“ Proceed . ”
11484	11523	11524	11524	I	0	“ Well , I interviewed them for my podcast and while we were n’t recording , she told me all about Going in Blind . Since I ’m in the market to settle down with someone . . . ”
11543	11608	11540	11540	I	0	“ I thought I ’d give it a try . I heard nothing but good things , so when I was getting ready , I was actually kind of nervous . I assumed I ’d be meeting someone interesting , someone like - minded , someone I matched well with . You can only imagine my disappointment when you turned out to be ManWearsPants . ”
11684	11689	11690	11690	he	498	“ Disappointment , indeed , ”
11693	11704	11690	11690	he	498	“ I ’m sorry if I ’ve ruined your evening . ”
11705	11713	11661	11661	They	499	“ Ugh , do n’t do that . ”
11714	11720	11721	11721	he	498	“ Do n’t do what ? ”
11727	11774	11721	11721	he	498	“ Play the bruised ego card . You and I both know there ’s nothing about this scenario that hurts your feelings . You ’re thriving off the fact that we were matched merely because it ’s ruined my evening and hopes for a possible match . ”
11775	11783	11784	11784	he	498	“ I do n’t thrive off that , ”
11787	11806	11784	11784	he	498	“ I find it somewhat comical , sure , but I do kind of feel bad for you . ”
11807	11825	11721	11721	he	498	“ I do n’t need you feeling bad for me . Save your pity for someone else . ”
11826	11876	11721	11721	he	498	“ I do n’t pity you . There ’s a difference . If I pitied you , then that would mean I have a low opinion of you , and that ’s not the case . I just feel bad that you consider your evening ruined by my presence . ”
11877	11894	11721	11721	he	498	“ Why do you have to say it like that ? Like you ’re the victim . ”
11895	11907	11908	11908	He	500	“ Trust me , babe , I ’m never the victim . ”
11953	11961	11962	11962	I	0	“ I was just expecting something else , ”
11972	11981	11962	11962	I	0	“ I was excited to meet someone new . ”
12022	12031	12019	12019	he	87	“ I ’m here because of a bet . ”
12038	12041	12042	12042	He	87	“ What ? ”
12053	12106	12045	12045	his	87	“ Before you think I intentionally came here to ruin your night , that ’s not the case . The fact that we ’re here together , sharing a meal , is pure coincidence . But the reason I signed up for this program is because I lost a bet to Breaker . ”
12107	12113	12019	12019	he	87	“ What kind of bet ? ”
12114	12201	12019	12019	he	87	“ We were playing one - on - one basketball . Our egos got the best of us and we decided whoever lost had to follow through on whatever the other person chose . It was a tied game . I was ready to force Breaker to go to some baking class I knew he ’d absolutely hate , and he apparently had plans for me to do this . I lost , he told me what I had to do , and here I am . ”
12202	12214	12045	12045	his	87	“ So , you ’re here because you lost a bet ? ”
12215	12218	12019	12019	he	87	“ Yes . ”
12219	12235	12019	12019	he	87	“ What if your date was n’t me ? What would you have done then ? ”
12236	12335	12336	12336	My	0	“ Attempted to enjoy the evening . Not sure where your disdainful opinion of me started , but I ’m a pretty good guy . Sure , the thought of not following through on the date tonight did cross my mind , but I knew I could n’t do that . So , my plan was to try to strike up conversation , enjoy a meal , then end the night with a wave . I planned to spend the rest of the evening in my pool , naked on a raft , staring up at the stars . ”
12377	12410	12411	12411	He	87	“ But now I ’m here with you , suffering through this conversation and begging the kitchen staff to hurry up with my meal so I can go back to my house . ”
12416	12426	12411	12411	He	87	“ What do you plan on doing after this ? ”
12434	12436	12411	12411	He	87	“ toy ”
12453	12467	12411	12411	He	87	“ Probably folding and ironing laundry while watching a new romcom on Netflix . ”
12468	12527	12411	12411	He	87	“ Let me guess — it ’s a flick about two people meeting , falling madly in love , then the guy does something stupid , the girl gets mad , they break up only for him to make a grand gesture to win back her hand , and then it ’s sealed with a happily ever after . ”
12535	12550	12532	12532	I	0	“ If you must know , yes , that would be the general idea . ”
12554	12563	12551	12551	He	87	“ You really believe life is like that ? ”
12564	12594	12411	12411	He	87	“ I ’d like to believe there ’s some validity to those stories . If anything , they give me hope for the kind of life I could have . ”
12595	12630	12532	12532	I	0	“ They ’re far - fetched fiction . Life does n’t revolve around the movie star falling in love with the lonesome construction worker and giving up everything to live in a quirky town . ”
12631	12687	12551	12551	He	87	“ You know , JP , just because your life does n’t work that way , does n’t mean others do n’t . Look at Lottie and Huxley , for instance . Their love story reads heavily like a romantic comedy , with all the twists and turns that a passionate love affair can offer . ”
12688	12716	12411	12411	He	87	“ They ran into each other on the sidewalk and struck up a deal to help each other . That does n’t really scream romance to me . ”
12717	12724	12532	12532	I	0	“ It ’s a classic trope . ”
12725	12729	12730	12730	he	506	“ A what ? ”
12739	12742	12733	12733	his	506	“ Ugh . ”
12763	12827	12743	12743	I	0	“ A trope is a plot or theme that helps tell a story . For instance , if I were to label Huxley and Lottie ’s romance , I would easily call it ‘ enemies to lovers ’ since they hated each other , with a smattering of ‘ fake fiancée ’ and a touch of ‘ billionaire . ’ All wildly popular . ”
12828	12834	12836	12836	his	506	“ Billionaire is a trope ? ”
12843	12849	12836	12836	his	506	“ A very popular one . ”
12850	12876	12743	12743	I	0	“ So , let me get this straight — you think that your life is going to be some sort of romcom with these tropes ? ”
12877	12893	12894	12894	I	0	“ No , but I was hoping for better company than the one currently present , ”
12906	12922	12894	12894	I	0	“ What ’s wrong with the present company ? We ’re having a healthy conversation . ”
12923	12959	12960	12960	His	506	“ This is what you consider healthy ? I ’m on the verge of either shooting my water up your nose or roundhouse kicking you to the ground . How does that scream healthy conversation ? ”
12979	12994	12976	12976	he	506	“ Seems to me like you need to go to some anger management classes . ”
13011	13019	12976	12976	he	506	“ That ’s the dumbest movie ever . ”
13020	13024	13025	13025	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
13043	13079	13040	13041	the man	355	“ You ’re telling me , out of all the movies in the entire world , your all - time favorite , the one you can watch over and over again is Sleepless in Seattle ? ”
13080	13092	12976	12976	he	506	“ Yes . When Harry Met Sally is a close second . ”
13093	13101	12976	12976	he	506	“ Meg Ryan fan , are we ? ”
13102	13115	13040	13041	the man	355	“ How can you not be a fan of her delightful charm ? ”
13116	13140	12976	12976	he	506	“ I mean , she ’s fine , but I ’m not going to seek out a movie because she ’s in it . ”
13141	13164	13165	13165	He	355	“ Well , you should . Maybe you could learn something from watching her movies , become more desirable to be around . ”
13175	13187	13165	13165	He	355	“ Have n’t had any complaints about my company being desirable . ”
13205	13218	13202	13202	I	0	“ So , what makes Sleepless in Seattle so far beneath you ? ”
13219	13224	13202	13202	I	0	“ It ’s unbelievable . ”
13225	13229	13230	13230	I	0	“ How so ? ”
13235	13304	13230	13230	I	0	“ Well , besides the fact that a child not only purchased a plane ticket by himself , but he flew across the country with no parental guidance , found his way to the Empire State Building , and reached the top without one person questioning him ? Yeah , that would never happen . But also , because Meg Ryan is a clear stalker in this movie . ”
13305	13317	13202	13202	I	0	“ She ’s not a stalker . She ’s merely curious . ”
13318	13336	13202	13202	I	0	“ Be curious about your neighbor , not some questionable father all the way across the country . ”
13337	13343	13202	13202	I	0	“ His story touched her . ”
13344	13360	13361	13361	JP	87	“ He ’s a forlorn father trying to find some ass through a radio show . ”
13364	13388	13361	13361	JP	87	“ Job well done , Tom Hanks . You were able to sweep lonely and desperate women off their feet from miles away . ”
13389	13403	13202	13202	I	0	“ Oh my God , you ’re . . . you ’re gross . ”
13404	13407	13408	13408	he	87	“ Gross ? ”
13418	13441	13411	13411	his	87	“ How am I the gross one ? I ’m not chasing tail across the country , using my son as bait . ”
13442	13470	13202	13202	I	0	“ Um , Sam Baldwin had no idea that ’s what was happening . If you recall , he was absolutely distraught over his son ’s disappearance . ”
13471	13598	13602	13602	him	510	“ Okay , sure , he pulled his hand from under his woman ’s shirt long enough to realize his son was missing . Great parenting . But put all of that aside , and you really think they would ’ve fallen for each other ? They caught one glimpse of each other and then all of a sudden , they were at the top of the Empire State Building , and in love ? There ’s absolutely no believability to their relationship . If that movie had an epilogue , it would show them awkwardly realizing the next morning that they live over three thousand miles apart , he lives on a houseboat , and they have absolutely nothing in common other than idiotic spontaneity . ”
13652	13662	13602	13602	him	510	“ Are you done ripping apart my favorite movie ? ”
13663	13668	13669	13669	He	510	“ I think so . ”
13672	13686	13669	13669	He	510	“ Good . Now , Rotten Tomatoes , tell me your favorite movie . ”
13687	13722	13602	13602	him	510	“ Why , so you can pretend you do n’t like it and attempt to give it the tongue - lashing I just unleashed on your favorite movie ? I ’m good , thanks . ”
13723	13744	13602	13602	him	510	“ How do you know I ’m going to be negative about your favorite movie ? I might like it . ”
13745	13804	13602	13602	him	510	“ How do I know you ’re going to be negative ? Because for the past five minutes , I ’ve watched you mentally plot my death . My guess is when we ’re done with this dinner , you ’re going to push me down the stairs on our way out , tumbling me into a coma . ”
13824	13847	13602	13602	him	510	“ You know , if I ’m going to get caught , planting my knife in your chest might be more satisfactory . ”
13848	13851	13852	13852	he	511	“ Jesus , ”
13872	13894	13895	13895	He	511	“ You ’re right , that was uncalled for . I think the trip down the stairs is more my style . ”
13898	13915	13895	13895	He	511	“ Glad I do n’t have to whisk your knife away when you ’re not looking . ”
13916	13939	13602	13602	him	510	“ Do n’t be so dramatic . I do n’t look good in orange . Committing a crime is not for me . ”
13940	13951	13895	13895	He	511	“ So orange is not the new black for you ? ”
13952	13955	13956	13956	I	0	“ No . ”
13966	13981	13956	13956	I	0	“ So , what ’s your favorite movie ? You owe me this much . ”
13982	13988	13895	13895	He	511	“ I owe you nothing . ”
13989	14032	13895	13895	He	511	“ JP , this has been an uneventful evening that I ’m begging to end and you ’ve made it that much more unbearable . Please , delight me with your nonsensical movie choice . Or I ’m going to start guessing . ”
14033	14042	14043	14043	Heaving	115	“ That sounds more appealing . Start guessing . ”
14054	14059	14048	14048	I	0	“ Is it porn ? ”
14060	14071	13895	13895	He	511	“ Come on , I have more class than that . ”
14072	14087	14088	14088	I	0	“ Debatable , but I ’ll rule that out just for now . Hmm . ”
14097	14149	14088	14088	I	0	“ Based on your disdain for romantic comedies , I ’m going to lean more toward some blood - and - gore action flick . And since you try to hold the high - and - mighty card , I ’m going to guess your favorite movie is something like Braveheart . ”
14150	14153	14154	14154	He	512	“ Nope . ”
14159	14163	14156	14156	his	512	“ The Godfather ? ”
14164	14169	14088	14088	I	0	“ Not even close . ”
14170	14177	14088	14088	I	0	“ Eww , is it Rocky ? ”
14178	14184	14185	14185	I	0	“ That would be laughable . ”
14194	14207	14185	14185	I	0	“ Umm , Saving Private Ryan , The Green Mile , Philadelphia . ”
14208	14218	14088	14088	I	0	“ Are you just guessing Tom Hanks movies now ? ”
14219	14266	14088	14088	I	0	“ Just checking , seeing if any of those sparked any interest . I can see that they did n’t . So now I ’m going to go the less prolific route and say Step Brothers , 40 - Year - Old Virgin , Billy Madison . ”
14267	14274	14185	14185	I	0	“ All funny , but no . ”
14275	14293	14088	14088	I	0	“ Ugh , I do n’t know . Give me a hint . Who stars in it ? ”
14294	14298	14088	14088	I	0	“ Julie Andrews . ”
14299	14313	14314	14314	He	512	“ Julie — what ? Julie Andrews as in Mary Poppins Julie Andrews ? ”
14317	14324	14314	14314	He	512	“ You ’re messing with me . ”
14325	14335	14088	14088	I	0	“ No . What ’s wrong with Julie Andrews ? ”
14336	14396	14088	14088	I	0	“ Nothing , I just . . . I do n’t know , I was thinking you were going to say someone like Liam Neeson , Sam Elliott , or Jeff Bridges . You know , all rough and gruff , ready - to - seek - revenge actors . Not Julie Andrews , with her blonde pixie haircut . ”
14397	14405	14088	14088	I	0	“ What little you know of me . ”
14406	14421	14088	14088	I	0	“ You ’re not kidding , your favorite movie has Julie Andrews in it ? ”
14422	14425	14426	14426	He	512	“ Yup . ”
14429	14434	14426	14426	He	512	“ What is it ? ”
14435	14441	14088	14088	I	0	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
14442	14501	14088	14088	I	0	“ Not even in the slightest . It ’s truly more confusing than anything . So , I ’m at a loss . The only Julie Andrews movies coming to mind are , well , Mary Poppins and The Princess Diaries and I think I ’ll fall out of my chair if any of those are the answer . ”
14502	14510	14426	14426	He	512	“ Nope , neither of those classics . ”
14511	14519	14520	14520	I	0	“ You ’ve watched both of them ? ”
14544	14597	14541	14542	three brothers	514	“ Of course I have . Mary Poppins is wholesome , and I once dated this girl who was obsessed with Anne Hathaway and made me watch every movie of hers . The Devil Wears Prada was a complete nightmare , by the way . What kind of shit ending was that ? ”
14598	14608	14426	14426	He	512	“ I thought you did n’t like romantic comedies ? ”
14609	14624	14541	14542	three brothers	514	“ I do n’t , and that movie is one of the main reasons . ”
14625	14643	14644	14644	I	0	“ Okay , so if it ’s not one of those . . . what is it ? ”
14647	14657	14644	14644	I	0	“ Ca n’t possibly be The Sound of Music . ”
14658	14665	14666	14666	he	512	“ Why do you assume that ? ”
14691	14725	14541	14542	three brothers	514	“ Uh , because it ’s a musical and , excuse me if I ’m wrong , I do n’t really see you as a toe - tapping , musical kind of man . ”
14726	14746	14747	14747	He	512	“ You know , you really should n’t judge people based on the little knowledge you have of them . ”
14757	14804	14747	14747	He	512	“ For your information , The Sound of Music is my favorite movie . It has everything you need , a hot nanny ex - nun who can sing , a grumpy , Nazi - fighting hero , beautifully composed music , betrayal , and suspense . ”
14824	14832	14833	14833	He	512	“ Why do n’t I believe you ? ”
14836	14850	14833	14833	He	512	“ That ’s on you if you choose to believe me or not . ”
14851	14872	14747	14747	He	512	“ If I had my phone , I would text Huxley right now and see if that ’s the truth . ”
14873	14934	14747	14747	He	512	“ When you get your phone , have at it . He knows I love watching Maria twirl around on a mountaintop . One year , for Halloween , I dressed up as Maria , and another year , I was Baron Von Trapp . And then Maria again , because the costume was too good to only wear once . ”
14935	14947	14833	14833	He	512	“ I still . . . I do n’t believe you . ”
14948	15019	14747	14747	He	512	“ Suit yourself . But I ’ll tell you this , I own the cassette tape , the CD , the VHS , the DVR , the Blu Ray , and a digital copy of The Sound of Music . Not to mention , I have a treasured signed autograph picture from Julie Andrews . I keep them all in a fireproof safe in my house in an undisclosed location . ”
15020	15030	15031	15031	He	515	“ Okay , now I know you ’re lying . ”
15144	15154	15124	15124	he	515	“ Doe , a deer , a female deer — ”
15155	15162	15163	15163	I	0	“ Will you knock that off ? ”
15171	15191	15163	15163	I	0	“ God , just eat your food and be quiet so we can get the hell out of here . ”
15192	15201	15124	15124	he	515	“ Are n’t you a pleasant dinner companion ? ”
15202	15255	15124	15124	he	515	“ You ’ve been nonstop singing , humming , beat - bopping songs since you brought up The Sound of Music and I ’m about to lose my mind . I ’m going to have ‘ How do you solve a problem like Maria ? ’ stuck in my head for eternity . ”
15256	15261	15163	15163	I	0	“ Could be worse . ”
15262	15269	15270	15270	I	0	“ How could it be worse ? ”
15273	15289	15270	15270	I	0	“ Could be a completely inappropriate song . Something along the lines of . . . ”
15301	15310	15290	15290	He	518	“ My neck , my back , lick — ”
15311	15319	15320	15320	I	0	“ Okay , I got your point , ”
15328	15335	15320	15320	I	0	“ Have you heard that one ? ”
15336	15343	15344	15344	I	0	“ Everyone has heard that one , ”
15402	15415	15416	15416	My	0	“ Have you ever entertained such an adventure as that song suggests ? ”
15434	15447	15422	15422	I	0	“ I do n’t see how that ’s any of your business . ”
15448	15479	15499	15499	He	87	“ It ’s not , but we have to kill the time somehow , so I ’m going to assume from your bothered answer , that would be a no . ”
15480	15490	15491	15491	He	87	“ As if you ’ve done something like that . ”
15525	15546	15514	15514	He	87	“ I ’ve done pretty much everything , Kelsey , and I ’ve delivered . . . every single time . ”
15547	15556	15557	15557	I	0	“ Uh - huh , I ’m sure , ”
15567	15582	15564	15564	he	87	“ I always make sure my girl comes , even if I do n’t . ”
15583	15588	15589	15589	I	0	“ That ’s great . ”
15598	15621	15589	15589	I	0	“ I ’ve even faked it a time or two , just to get the hell out of there , you know ? ”
15643	15658	15630	15630	I	0	“ There ’s no way you fake it . You ca n’t fake sperm . ”
15659	15674	15589	15589	I	0	“ Girls do n’t check the condom , unless that ’s something you do . ”
15675	15697	15757	15757	him	87	“ Eww , no , gross . Please change the subject , I hardly see how this is an appetizing conversation . ”
15698	15706	15630	15630	I	0	“ Sex is always an appetizing conversation . ”
15707	15732	15589	15589	I	0	“ Yes , well , not the details of you acting like you fake it and what ’s in or not in your condom . ”
15733	15748	15757	15757	him	87	“ I ’m not acting like I fake it . . . I do . ”
15749	15754	15755	15755	I	0	“ Okay , JP . ”
15762	15770	15755	15755	I	0	“ Good for you on your accomplishments . ”
15868	15871	15872	15872	JP	87	“ Fuck , ”
15915	15920	15912	15912	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
15940	15943	15944	15944	he	87	“ Mmm , ”
15947	15977	15944	15944	he	87	“ Did you bite your lip ? You know , I do that sometimes . It might develop into a canker sore , so be mentally prepared for that . ”
16007	16014	16003	16003	he	87	“ Fuck . . . yes . ”
16036	16053	16031	16031	he	87	“ Yes , baby , right there . . . mmm , you feel so good . ”
16077	16096	16097	16097	I	0	“ Are you really doing this ? Are you really doing the scene from When Harry Met Sally ? ”
16100	16114	16097	16097	I	0	“ Fuck . That mouth of yours . Yes , suck me deep . ”
16131	16149	16123	16123	I	0	“ Hey , yoo - hoo , you can stop that now . I get your point . ”
16183	16207	16180	16180	his	87	“ Yes , baby , your pussy is so fucking good . Uhhhhh , yes , fuck , I need to pump harder . ”
16208	16221	16222	16222	I	0	“ No , no , that ’s okay , no pumping necessary , ”
16250	16255	16256	16256	He	87	“ Shit . . . ”
16292	16314	16315	16315	he	87	“ You ’re going to come , I can feel it , but not yet , not until I tell you , ”
16357	16376	16350	16350	He	87	“ Not yet , baby , do n’t you fucking come , not until I give you permission . ”
16383	16394	16377	16377	His	87	“ Ahh , fuck , good girl . Hold it . ”
16431	16455	16456	16456	He	87	“ Jesus , your pussy is so good , so good . Yes , fuck me like that . Keep going , baby . ”
16557	16564	16565	16565	he	87	“ Mother . . . fucker , ”
16568	16579	16565	16565	he	87	“ Come , baby , come on my greedy cock . ”
16654	16662	16663	16663	Helix	106	“ Uh , everything okay up here ? ”
16714	16717	16718	16718	I	0	“ Yes ! ”
16721	16760	16718	16718	I	0	“ Everything is . . . yes . We ’re fine . Nothing going on up here . Just , uh , chatting and whatnot . No need to worry about us . Yup . Nothing freaky happening . ”
16793	16800	16784	16784	He	87	“ My compliments to the chef . ”
16828	16837	16784	16784	He	87	“ I ’ll have what HE ’S having . ”
16841	16858	16861	16861	I	0	“ Are you really not going to talk to me for the rest of the evening ? ”
16864	16873	16861	16861	I	0	“ Do you realize how embarrassing that was ? ”
16874	16904	16861	16861	I	0	“ Yeah , really embarrassing for you . Helix saw you turned on , nipples hard , ready to go . Not sure if he was ready for that . ”
16905	16912	16913	16913	I	0	“ I was NOT turned on , ”
16929	16937	16913	16913	I	0	“ You ’re acting like a child . ”
16938	16958	16861	16861	I	0	“ Or am I just trying to loosen you up ? Christ , woman , take a chill pill . ”
16959	16979	16980	16980	He	532	“ Do n’t tell me to loosen up . I ’ll loosen up when I want to loosen up . ”
17000	17017	17018	17018	His	532	“ Well , guess what , I ’m only crazy because you ’re making me crazy . ”
17023	17026	17018	17018	His	532	“ What ? ”
17033	17042	17018	17018	His	532	“ I did n’t say you were crazy . ”
17043	17050	17018	17018	His	532	“ Then what did you say ? ”
17051	17054	17055	17055	He	532	“ Nothing . ”
17060	17070	17055	17055	He	532	“ But now I ’m thinking you ’re crazy . ”
17088	17097	17071	17071	I	0	“ Ugh , this night will never end . ”
17098	17115	17137	17137	his	532	“ Instead of complaining about it , you could ask me another question , you know ? ”
17116	17123	17137	17137	his	532	“ That does n’t sound appealing . ”
17124	17134	17135	17135	He	532	“ Fine , I ’ll ask you a question . ”
17141	17158	17137	17137	his	532	“ So , tell me , Kelsey , what are you looking for in a man ? ”
17159	17163	17137	17137	his	532	“ Not you . ”
17164	17175	17176	17176	I	0	“ Your flushed cheeks from moments ago beg to differ . ”
17191	17240	17188	17188	he	532	“ You know , we can either sit here in silence , which I know makes you more uncomfortable and chattier and will cause you to divulge information you probably do n’t want me knowing . Or , you can control your babbling by answering a simple question . ”
17259	17265	17188	17188	he	532	“ Ask me something else . ”
17266	17278	17279	17279	I	0	“ Okay , what do you find attractive in a man ? ”
17285	17307	17308	17308	He	532	“ Let me guess — if I do n’t answer this question , you will find one eerily similar to ask ? ”
17311	17322	17308	17308	He	532	“ Yes , and I ’ll keep going from there . ”
17340	17374	17375	17375	He	532	“ Fine , you want to know what I want in a man ? Well , firstly , someone who does n’t annoy me , secondly , someone who does n’t purposefully lie — ”
17385	17410	17377	17377	his	532	“ Kelsey , from the tone of your voice , it almost seems like you ’re suggesting that I annoy you and purposefully lie . ”
17411	17429	17500	17500	I	0	“ How did you ever figure that out ? Wow , JP , you ’re a genius . ”
17430	17433	17434	17434	he	532	“ Jesus , ”
17437	17459	17434	17434	he	532	“ You ’re ripe tonight . You ’ve always been decently chill , but tonight , you ’re on another level . ”
17476	17494	17472	17472	I	0	“ Yes , because I thought tonight was going to be different . I thought . . . ”
17503	17574	17500	17500	I	0	“ I thought I was going to meet someone I could actually date . I thought this was the start of something new , something exciting . I was excited to go on a date , but that ’s not what tonight has been . It ’s been disappointing , and a giant ball of irritation . So , excuse me if I ’m not the delightful company you expected . ”
17575	17607	17662	17662	his	535	“ You ’re really not . I might ask for a refund . Hypercritical fishwife is n’t what I call a good first date or a match , for that matter . ”
17608	17611	17612	17612	I	0	“ Fishwife ? ”
17615	17633	17612	17612	I	0	“ Yup . Already called you a shrew , thought fishwife would be a good second option . ”
17634	17653	17662	17662	his	535	“ Yeah . . . well , you ’re a . . . you ’re a . . . ”
17654	17658	17659	17659	he	535	“ A what ? ”
17678	17683	17684	17684	He	535	“ A shortsighted boob . ”
17696	17713	17714	17714	He	535	“ That ’s the best you could come up with ? A shortsighted boob ? Shit . ”
17728	17754	17720	17720	I	0	“ I think I might get that printed on a T - shirt . You ’re a shortsighted boob . Jesus , that ’s good . ”
17783	17788	17780	17780	I	0	“ Are you finished ? ”
17789	17794	17795	17795	He	535	“ I think so . ”
17803	17818	17795	17795	He	535	“ Oh man , any more of those golden insults you have stored away ? ”
17819	17838	17780	17780	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Do you have any other names to call me other than fishwife ? ”
17839	17848	17795	17795	He	535	“ Sure do . . . uptight gorgon . ”
17897	17903	17893	17893	My	0	“ Half - cracked ignoramus . ”

17942	17946	17939	17939	I	0	“ Callous cockhead . ”
17955	17959	17948	17948	he	535	“ Simpering concubine . ”
17960	17989	17918	17918	He	535	“ Strumpet and concubine would allude to me being loose with my legs and I can guarantee you right now , there ’s nothing loose about my appendages . ”
17990	17998	17999	17999	Helix	106	“ Uh . . . everything okay ? ”
18008	18031	18032	18032	JP	87	“ Maybe you should be loose , have someone fish that pole out of your ass that you seem to be clenching . ”
18046	18054	18055	18055	Helix	106	“ Would you guys like the check ? ”
18058	18084	18055	18055	Helix	106	“ So , I have a pole up my ass because I ’m not fainting at your feet over your nonsensical drivel and squawky singing ? ”
18085	18088	18089	18089	JP	87	“ Squawky ? ”
18094	18106	18089	18089	JP	87	“ Try again . There ’s nothing squawky about my singing . ”
18107	18131	18132	18132	Helix	106	“ Yeah , I ’ll just , uh , go grab that check . I ’m thinking dessert is n’t a thing tonight . ”
18145	18164	18136	18136	JP	87	“ I ’ve heard cats in heat sound better than what I ’ve had to suffer through tonight . ”
18165	18173	18174	18174	He	106	“ You ’re so full of shit . ”
18182	18190	18174	18174	He	106	“ I saw you bobbing your head . ”
18191	18225	18136	18136	JP	87	“ Oh , you ’re cute thinking that was bobbing , more like twitching from how horrendous you sounded . You sure know how to make someone ’s muscles fire off in revolt . ”
18226	18239	18240	18240	I	0	“ Is that supposed to be funny ? Because it ’s not . ”
18246	18254	18240	18240	I	0	“ Have I hurt your man feelings ? ”
18277	18281	18282	18282	JP	87	“ Let go , ”
18285	18301	18302	18302	I	0	“ There ’s no way in hell I ’m letting you pay for this meal , ”
18317	18322	18305	18305	He	87	“ Doe , a deer ”
18344	18357	18371	18371	He	87	“ Over my dead and squawking body will I let you pay . ”
18358	18364	18365	18365	Helix	106	“ Here are your phones , ”
18411	18420	18421	18421	He	87	“ I ’ll just set them down here . ”
18447	18450	18442	18445	Smart , smart man	538	“ Fine . ”
18476	18483	18469	18469	I	0	“ There , paid my half . ”
18484	18498	18469	18469	I	0	“ Pick that fucking money up right now . You ’re not paying . ”
18499	18515	18442	18445	Smart , smart man	538	“ Why not ? I can afford it . Your brother pays me pretty well . ”
18516	18524	18469	18469	I	0	“ This is n’t a money thing . ”
18525	18531	18532	18532	I	0	“ Then what is it ? ”
18535	18540	18532	18532	I	0	“ A pride thing ? ”
18541	18560	18469	18469	I	0	“ Yeah , I always pay for a goddamn meal when I take someone out on a date . ”
18561	18610	18469	18469	I	0	“ Well , you did n’t take me out on a date , as this was an unfortunate coincidence . This was a loathsome , mind - numbingly pitiful tryst . Trust me , if this was a real date , it would not have gone like this . ”
18611	18640	18641	18641	My	0	“ If this was a real date , I would ’ve bent you over this table and spanked your ass for the way you ’ve spoken to me . ”
18645	18649	18641	18641	My	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
18650	18655	18656	18656	He	539	“ You heard me . ”
18742	18755	18756	18756	He	539	“ That ’s outrageous behavior . No one spanks women these days . ”
18767	18778	18779	18779	He	539	“ Clearly you have n’t been with the right men . ”
18806	18819	18797	18797	I	0	“ I ’ve been with perfect gentlemen , thank you very much . ”
18820	18827	18828	18828	JP	87	“ And there ’s your problem , ”
18834	18850	18828	18828	JP	87	“ A perfect gentleman is n’t going to make you come the way I can . ”
18918	18926	18927	18927	I	0	“ Do n’t flatter yourself , JP . ”
18963	19011	18955	18955	He	539	“ I do n’t need to flatter myself when it ’s facts . If you were in my bed , you ’d forget your name , your cunt would be begging for my cock , and your voice would be hoarse from crying out my name repeatedly . ”
19189	19206	19181	19181	his	87	“ Tonight was an absolute succubus of valuable time . I hope it never happens again . ”
19207	19213	19214	19214	I	0	“ You and me both , ”
19222	19252	19214	19214	I	0	“ You were unpleasant and a self - assured ass . I would rather stick my head in a gas station toilet than go on another date with you . ”
19253	19275	19276	19276	I	0	“ The pleasure was not mine , babe . Hope you come down with a bad case of the toots later . ”
19288	19305	19285	19285	he	87	“ Yeah , well . . . I hope your penis gets stuck in your zipper . ”
19390	19402	19403	19403	He	87	“ If only my penis got stuck between your legs instead . ”
19410	19419	19403	19403	He	87	“ Do n’t trip on your way home . ”
19448	19455	19456	19456	I	0	“ Hope to see you never , ”
19858	19866	19867	19867	Breaker	97	“ There he is , Casanova himself . ”
19879	19889	19867	19867	Breaker	97	“ How was it ? Love at first sight ? ”
20061	20065	20066	20066	I	0	“ Last night ? ”
20072	20101	20066	20066	I	0	“ Well , when I first saw my date , I actually hoped it would go well , but that thought quickly vanished when she opened her mouth . ”
20102	20113	20114	20114	I	0	“ Oh shit , did she have a screechy voice ? ”
20119	20132	20114	20114	I	0	“ No , she let me know how much she hated me . ”
20141	20152	20133	20133	Breaker	97	“ What do you mean ? Did she know you ? ”
20157	20165	20153	20153	I	0	“ Oh yeah , she knew me . ”
20166	20177	20114	20114	I	0	“ How ? Did you go out with her once ? ”
20178	20181	20182	20182	I	0	“ Nope . ”
20195	20201	20182	20182	I	0	“ My date was Kelsey . ”
20202	20205	20206	20206	Breaker	97	“ Kelsey ? ”
20211	20218	20206	20206	Breaker	97	“ As in Lottie ’s sister ? ”
20219	20222	20182	20182	I	0	“ Yup . ”
20223	20228	20229	20229	Breaker	97	“ Oh , fuck . ”
20247	20255	20229	20229	Breaker	97	“ Dude , what are the chances ? ”
20256	20262	20182	20182	I	0	“ Pretty good , apparently . ”
20263	20281	20182	20182	I	0	“ Let me guess — she walked out of the restaurant when she saw it was you ? ”
20282	20333	20229	20229	Breaker	97	“ Nope . Because of the program ’s rules , you ’re forced to eat dinner with the person they set you up with . And because we showed signs of a full - out medieval battle , they put us in the private loft , away from everyone else . ”
20334	20341	20182	20182	I	0	“ And how did that go ? ”
20342	20346	20182	20182	I	0	“ Not great . ”
20357	20369	20347	20347	I	0	“ But you said you were excited at first . Why ? ”
20370	20376	20377	20377	I	0	“ Because it was Kelsey , ”
20381	20427	20377	20377	I	0	“ I knew her , so I did n’t have to try to get to know a stranger when I was already not in the mood to be there . Did n’t think it would be uncomfortable , plus . . . she looked hot . ”
20431	20446	20428	20428	I	0	“ But all of that washed away the moment she begged me to leave . ”
20447	20476	20347	20347	I	0	“ Which she was n’t allowed to do , and I ’m sure that only made her even angrier . She has the same fiery spirit as Lottie . ”
20477	20526	20581	20581	Breaker	97	“ Yeah , and it showed . When I say she was unpleasant , I ’m not kidding . We ended up fighting the entire time and , sure , I did n’t help matters . At the end of the night , we went our separate ways . ”
20527	20536	20537	20537	Breaker	97	“ And how do you feel about that ? ”
20540	20543	20537	20537	Breaker	97	“ Relieved , ”
20547	20580	20581	20581	Breaker	97	“ It was fucking exhausting having dinner with her . Sure , I like some quick - witted repartee here and there , but when I got home , I felt drained . ”
20634	20642	20643	20643	he	97	“ Why do n’t I believe you ? ”
20650	20659	20660	20660	I	0	“ Dude , trust me when I say — ”
20742	20747	20748	20748	She	89	“ Breaker , hi . ”
20756	20773	20750	20750	her	89	“ I , uh , I did n’t see you there . Sorry about barging in . ”
20788	20802	20803	20803	Kelsey	89	“ Hey , Kelsey , heard you had quite the night last night . ”
20811	20816	20803	20803	Kelsey	89	“ You told him ? ”
20817	20853	20855	20855	herself	89	“ Well , he ’s my brother , and he was the one who forced me to go on the date , so it ’s only natural that he ’d ask me how it went . ”
20864	20875	20857	20857	Kelsey	89	“ Would you give me a second with your brother ? ”
20881	20885	20876	20876	He	97	“ Of course . ”
20895	20906	20892	20892	Kelsey	89	“ And I would appreciate your discretion in this matter . ”
20916	20937	20907	20907	Breaker	97	“ I understand the need to not be attached by name to him . I wish I was n’t either . ”
20978	20987	20990	20990	her	89	“ To what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
20992	21009	20988	20988	I	0	“ After last night , I figured we need to talk about how to handle this . ”
21010	21014	21015	21015	I	0	“ Handle what ? ”
21025	21060	21019	21019	my	0	“ Oh , hell , did you fall in love with me last night and now you ’re trying to figure out how to muddle through work while harboring these intense feelings about me ? ”
21076	21106	21019	21019	my	0	“ If any revelation happened last night , it most certainly had nothing to do with love and everything to do with this extreme distaste I have for you . ”
21107	21118	21119	21119	I	0	“ Ooh , distaste . That ’s a new one . ”
21127	21132	21119	21119	I	0	“ Please do elaborate . ”
21133	21141	21019	21019	my	0	“ This is n’t funny , JP . ”
21142	21150	21151	21151	Her	89	“ Did n’t know I was laughing . ”
21161	21183	21155	21155	she	89	“ You do n’t have to laugh in order to make a laughing matter out of something that ’s incredibly serious . ”
21254	21295	21248	21248	I	0	“ Okay , tell me why our situation is incredibly serious , because unless I missed something , nothing , and I mean nothing , happened between us last night . Well , nothing that requires this level of psychosis . ”
21296	21307	21207	21207	her	89	“ JP , we went on a date last night . ”
21308	21314	21315	21315	I	0	“ Not by our choice . ”
21324	21355	21315	21315	I	0	“ But it still happened . We shared an intense meal , and then after , when we were leaving , you said . . . you said some things . ”
21356	21382	21383	21383	She	575	“ Oh . . . the whole ‘ If you were in my bed , your cunt would be begging for my cock ’ part ? ”
21390	21396	21383	21383	She	575	“ Yes , that part . ”
21397	21410	21315	21315	I	0	“ It was just basic facts . Nothing to make note of . ”
21411	21412	21383	21383	She	575	“ Well”—she
21425	21439	21414	21414	her	575	skirt—“it was inappropriate , and we need to set some ground rules here . ”
21440	21446	21447	21447	I	0	“ This should be good . ”
21458	21470	21447	21447	I	0	“ Lay it on me — what are the ground rules ? ”
21471	21477	21447	21447	I	0	“ Well , for one — ”
21478	21522	21523	21523	I	0	“ Real quick , I just need to put this out there — your reaction is completely ridiculous and over the top , but you know , to each their own . Your feelings are your feelings . . . all that bullshit . ”
21528	21533	21523	21523	I	0	“ You may proceed . ”
21553	21592	21547	21547	hers	575	“ As I was saying , our first ground rule is we do n’t speak of last night , ever . I did n’t tell Lottie and I would appreciate it if you did n’t tell anyone else . ”
21593	21599	21534	21534	Her	575	“ Am I that repulsive ? ”
21600	21603	21604	21604	I	0	“ Yes . ”
21638	21671	21609	21609	she	575	“ I also do n’t want people thinking I get involved with any man who crosses my path or that I ’m trying to climb the corporate ladder by spreading my legs . ”
21672	21683	21684	21684	Her	575	“ Do n’t worry , your sister covered that one . ”
21693	21706	21688	21688	she	575	“ That was not how that went down and you know it . ”
21707	21719	21688	21688	she	575	“ You ’re right , that was uncalled for . Sorry . ”
21752	21770	21749	21749	she	575	“ So we do n’t talk about last night , ever . Act like it never happened . ”
21771	21778	21749	21749	she	575	“ I wish it did n’t . ”
21807	21824	21800	21800	she	575	“ JP , I need you to say you ’re never going to talk about it . ”
21825	21828	21829	21829	I	0	“ Christ . ”
21834	21844	21829	21829	I	0	“ I ’m never going to talk about it . ”
21852	21865	21829	21829	I	0	“ Second ground rule — there will be no more inappropriate behavior . ”
21881	21894	21866	21866	I	0	“ Not sure what you ’re alluding to with that ground rule . ”
21895	21910	21829	21829	I	0	“ The way you speak to me and the little touches need to end . ”
21911	21959	21866	21866	I	0	“ You act as if I ’m grazing your hand when I walk by or sliding my hand to your lower back . . . or gripping your thigh while at the conference table . Correct me if I ’m wrong , but that has never happened . ”
21960	21992	21866	21866	I	0	“ It , uh . . . it has n’t . But you know , the things you say are n’t appropriate for a workplace , so that needs to stop . ”
21993	22009	21829	21829	I	0	“ The ‘ cunt calling out for my cock ’ thing was outside of work . ”
22010	22027	21866	21866	I	0	“ You ’ve said more than that while at work , and do n’t deny it . ”
22031	22042	21866	21866	I	0	“ Okay , your wish is my command , babe . ”
22043	22049	22050	22050	She	578	“ And none of that . ”
22058	22087	22050	22050	She	578	“ None of that babe stuff . I ’m Kelsey , you ’re JP , and that ’s it . Nothing else . I ’m not your babe . ”
22088	22126	22052	22052	her	578	“ Just a term of endearment , but sure , Kelsey . That ’s how I ’ll refer to you from now on , unless you wanted something more along the lines of . . . fishwife ? ”
22186	22211	22212	22212	she	89	“ You do realize you ’re the absolute worst to have a conversation with , right ? Like . . . the absolute worst , ”
22221	22249	22212	22212	she	89	“ I only seem to receive that sort of feedback from you , which makes me think it ’s a you thing , not a me thing . ”
22263	22267	22257	22257	she	89	“ And thirdly — ”
22268	22283	22284	22284	I	0	“ A third ground rule ? Was not expecting that . Total plot twist . ”
22292	22303	22284	22284	I	0	“ Please , continue to pleasure me with your commands . ”
22304	22327	22257	22257	she	89	“ I ’m talking to Huxley and asking him if I can fall under his management because our working relationship is volatile . ”
22328	22565	22569	22569	her	580	“ Ooh , you see , I was with you on points one and two , but unfortunately , your line of work falls under my line of work , therefore , that makes you my employee . Huxley is n’t going to bother taking on another task when his plate is already full . He also does n’t take too kindly to people telling him what to do , even if you ’re his future sister - in - law . And if you do approach him , all he ’s going to do is pull us into a conference room and ask that we work things out . . . in front of him . Now , given the restrictions that ground rule one presents us , you ’re not going to be able to tell him the truth as to why you do n’t want to work under me anymore , and therefore have no validity behind your case . Also , you ’re only going to paint yourself as confrontational since everyone else that does work with me has given me nothing but rave reviews . So . . . if you want to embarrass yourself and shine a spotlight on your difficult disposition , by all means , approach Huxley , but if you want to remain in his good graces , I would suggest you drop ground rule number three . ”
22627	22635	22636	22636	I	0	“ Then maybe Breaker could do it . ”
22639	22685	22636	22636	I	0	“ Managing a certified organizer does n’t fall under his scope of responsibilities . He ’s the numbers guy . Organizing and managing the different properties is n’t what he does . Hate to say it , Kelsey , but you ’re stuck with me . ”
22708	22721	22700	22700	I	0	“ I did n’t quite catch that . Can you repeat it ? ”
22732	22737	22722	22722	She	580	“ I despise you . ”
22738	22756	22757	22757	She	580	“ Now , now , now , is that something you should be saying to your employer ? ”
22777	22796	22770	22770	her	580	“ From here on out , we adhere to the two ground rules . Do you hear me ? ”
22797	22801	22802	22802	I	0	“ I do . ”
22805	22812	22802	22802	I	0	“ I hear you quite well . ”
22813	22860	22770	22770	her	580	“ And we ’ll only talk to each other when we need to , and about business only . When Huxley and Lottie invite us over , I want you nowhere near me . Do n’t even think about talking to me . Do you understand ? ”
22861	22870	22802	22802	I	0	“ I ’m practically shivering in my shoes . ”
22871	22883	22770	22770	her	580	“ JP , I ’m being serious . Do you understand ? ”
23006	23057	23003	23003	I	0	“ I understand you . And I look forward to our newly established working relationship where we do n’t ever mention the hot date we went on or the way you shivered when I talked about your cunt , or how you secretly love it when I call you babe . ”
23486	23498	23499	23499	I	0	“ Wow , sis . . . that ’s some dress , ”
23509	23524	23499	23499	I	0	“ Hux got it for me . Is it too . . . booby ? ”
23538	23583	23535	23535	I	0	“ I mean , it ’s really booby , but you also look hot . The red is perfect for your skin and that red lip color is such a great match . Now I feel like a fuddy - duddy in my dress . ”
23675	23702	23670	23670	I	0	“ Stop it . You look beautiful . I think the yellow was a perfect choice and it goes so nicely with your fresh caramel highlights . ”
23703	23708	23709	23709	I	0	“ You think so ? ”
23801	23810	23811	23811	Lottie	89	“ God , why am I so nervous ? ”
23828	23849	23813	23813	her	89	“ Probably because you asked a man on a date to a work event and you ’re worried about it . ”
24117	24166	24113	24113	He	87	“ I ’m a bit nervous . I like this guy . We ’ve only been out three times , and sometimes when he talks about birds , it can get slightly boring , but he ’s so kind and he does n’t try to poke my buttons . ”
24167	24173	24257	24257	Lottie	89	“ The antithesis of JP . ”
24174	24177	24178	24178	I	0	“ Exactly , ”
24183	24217	24178	24178	I	0	“ Not that JP and I were ever an item , but after the night we do n’t talk about . . . which , you did n’t tell Huxley , did you ? ”
24218	24221	24257	24257	Lottie	89	“ No . ”
24222	24251	24257	24257	Lottie	89	“ And you ’re not mad that I ’m making you keep it a secret ? It was your fault I told you since you kept pestering me . ”
24252	24256	24257	24257	Lottie	89	“ I know . ”
24267	24301	24257	24257	Lottie	89	“ And I like having a secret from Huxley . Makes me feel naughty . And if he ever finds out . . . ooh , I ca n’t wait for the punishment . ”
24332	24335	24336	24336	I	0	“ What ? ”
24339	24363	24336	24336	I	0	“ Not only are you going to make Edwin fall to the floor , but JP is going to be all over you . ”
24364	24384	24325	24325	Lottie	89	“ No , he ’s not . He has barely even looked at me during the last three weeks . ”
24385	24396	24325	24325	Lottie	89	“ Does n’t mean he does n’t think about you . ”
24397	24415	24336	24336	I	0	“ Will you stop it with that ? He never even liked me . . . ever . ”
24416	24449	24325	24325	Lottie	89	“ That ’s not what I heard . When he first met you , you were all he could talk about . But you were the one who put up the wall . ”
24450	24457	24458	24458	Lottie	89	“ Because I work for him . ”
24464	24471	24458	24458	Lottie	89	“ And I worked for Huxley . ”
24472	24489	24490	24490	She	89	“ Yeah , well . . . you apparently have no morals , but I do . ”
24502	24506	24507	24507	Lottie	89	“ Come in , ”
24653	24683	24650	24650	he	623	“ You . Are . Exquisite . I ’m going to peel that dress off you tonight , spread your legs , and make you come on my tongue . ”
24731	24741	24720	24720	his	623	“ Fuck , babe , you look so good . ”
24742	24758	24759	24759	I	0	“ Well , what a lovely night for a gala , do n’t you think ? ”
24766	24784	24785	24785	Lottie	89	“ Mmm , I could easily stay home and sit on your face , if you want , ”
24796	24820	24824	24824	them	626	“ I ’m just going to . . . uh . . . yeah , I ’m going to meet you guys downstairs . ”
25280	25294	25264	25264	he	87	“ Dude , the van is here . Get your ass down here . ”
25307	25316	25304	25304	I	0	“ Wh - what are you doing here ? ”
25326	25342	25317	25317	He	87	“ What do you mean what am I doing here ? Same reason you are . ”
25343	25356	25304	25304	I	0	“ But . . . do n’t you have your own transportation ? ”
25357	25362	25363	25363	he	87	“ Do n’t you ? ”
25366	25373	25363	25363	he	87	“ I got ready with Lottie . ”
25374	25402	25304	25304	I	0	“ Well , I just moved in across the street and figured it would be more eco - friendly to all ride together . Any other questions ? ”
25559	25564	25551	25551	Lottie	89	“ Hey , neighbor , ”
25582	25591	25579	25579	she	89	“ Does n’t my sister look beautiful tonight ? ”
25616	25622	25599	25599	She	89	“ I ’ve seen better . ”
25652	25675	25645	25645	he	87	“ Kelsey , you look stunning . I ’m sure Edwin will be very happy to have you on his arm tonight . ”
25682	25693	25645	25645	he	87	“ Edwin ? Is that your latest attempt at love ? ”
25694	25702	25703	25703	I	0	“ That is none of your concern , ”
25766	25771	25772	25772	I	0	“ I hate you , ”
25777	25781	25782	25782	she	414	“ I know , ”
25893	25904	25905	25905	I	0	“ You should ’ve told me he was coming tonight , ”
25974	26011	25966	25966	Huxley	90	“ I did n’t want you to not get ready with me because he was going to be here . This is our first fancy gala together . I did n’t want him to ruin it . ”
26012	26035	25966	25966	Huxley	90	“ Well , he did . I mean . . . he ’s seen better , what kind of comment is that ? ”
26036	26065	25966	25966	Huxley	90	“ A stupid one , because that ’s what he is , stupid . He clearly has feelings for you and does n’t know how to manage them . ”
26066	26093	25966	25966	Huxley	90	“ Oh my God , do n’t give me that crap . We ’re not in elementary school . He can act like an adult man . ”
26094	26178	25966	25966	Huxley	90	“ I ’m not taking his side , just trying to offer up some sort of explanation as to why he ’s acting like a tool . I ’ve seen him when he ’s relaxed and you ’re not around , and he ’s really nice , easygoing , and fun . Sure , he teases a lot , but that ’s sort of his way . I think if you got to know him better , you ’d see the same things . ”
26179	26197	26198	26199	The boys	598	“ I do n’t need to get to know him better . What I know is enough . ”
26339	26346	26347	26347	Lottie	89	“ How long is the drive ? ”
26350	26354	26347	26347	Lottie	89	“ Twenty minutes , ”
26358	26366	26355	26355	Huxley	90	“ It ’s at the River Estate . ”
26367	26374	26375	26375	Lottie	89	“ Edwin is meeting you there ? ”
26378	26381	26382	26382	I	0	“ Yes , ”
26385	26429	26382	26382	I	0	“ He ’ll be a touch late , but he ’ll be there . He actually had to rent a suit for the event because he did n’t have one . It was cute , and I helped him pick one out online . ”
26430	26442	26443	26443	JP	87	“ What self - respecting man does n’t own a suit ? ”
26456	26476	26453	26453	his	87	“ Someone who works from home for a living and does n’t go to events that require a suit . ”
26521	26529	26530	26530	Lottie	89	“ Did your date have a dress ? ”
26539	26549	26530	26530	Lottie	89	“ Or did you have to buy her one ? ”
26558	26572	26553	26553	his	87	“ Genesis has multiple dresses , but I still bought her one anyway . ”
26613	26626	26627	26627	I	0	“ Did you hire her to go on this date as well ? ”
26653	26660	26661	26661	JP	87	“ Interested in my dating life ? ”
26670	26691	26667	26667	his	87	“ No , I ’m not . Not even sure why I asked that . Probably just to goad you . ”
26692	26719	26667	26667	his	87	“ Well , for your information , I ’ve been dating Genesis for about two weeks now . She ’s the vice president of Mecca Tech . ”
26720	26725	26726	26726	I	0	“ That ’s nice , ”
26734	26744	26726	26726	I	0	“ I hope you two are very happy together . ”
26745	26751	26667	26667	his	87	“ We are , thanks . ”
26752	26762	26763	26763	Huxley	90	“ She only just kissed him the other night , ”
26767	26770	26771	26771	JP	87	“ Dude , ”
26835	26842	26832	26832	he	87	“ We ’re taking things slow . ”
26843	26849	26832	26832	he	87	“ I did n’t ask . ”
26858	26873	26850	26850	I	0	“ But you know , Edwin and I have shared more than one kiss . ”
26878	26906	26850	26850	I	0	“ And were those kisses any good ? Seems like a guy named Edwin kisses more like a cow licking a salt block than with desirable affection . ”
26907	26913	26946	26946	Lottie	89	“ He kisses just fine . ”
26926	26936	26937	26937	Lottie	89	“ Why do n’t we talk about something else ? ”
26988	27013	26975	26975	I	0	“ Uh , how about the wedding ? We have n’t talked about that much . Huxley and I decided on a beach wedding . ”
27014	27022	27023	27023	I	0	“ You did decide on the beach ? ”
27031	27042	27023	27023	I	0	“ That ’s so exciting . When did you decide ? ”
27043	27072	26975	26975	I	0	“ Just now . . . upstairs . Huxley went by the cove and restaurant you and I looked at the other day and he really liked it . ”
27073	27079	27080	27080	I	0	“ Is n’t it breathtaking ? ”
27084	27088	27082	27082	Huxley	90	“ It was . ”
27095	27108	27089	27089	His	672	“ I could envision marrying Lottie there , making her officially mine . ”
27564	27583	27561	27561	he	87	“ Easy there , killer . Would n’t want to make a spectacle on your first red carpet . ”
27740	27743	27738	27738	she	697	“ fuck . ”
27744	27748	27749	27749	he	87	“ You okay ? ”
27760	27765	27752	27752	his	87	“ Ye - yeah . ”
27820	27828	27829	27829	he	87	“ You sure ? You seem unsteady , ”
27861	27867	27849	27849	Huxley	90	“ Just a little shaken . ”
27868	27877	27878	27878	JP	87	“ Here , come this way , then , ”
27928	27932	27933	27933	JP	87	“ JP Cane , ”
27988	27999	27979	27979	I	0	“ God , I almost fell flat on my face . ”
28023	28030	28013	28013	JP	87	“ Thank you for helping me . ”
28031	28036	28037	28037	he	87	“ You ’re welcome , ”
28118	28125	28126	28126	I	0	“ That could ’ve been embarrassing , ”
28143	28181	28126	28126	I	0	“ I ’ve seen worse . You probably would ’ve just fallen to your knees , a boob would ’ve popped out , and then it would ’ve been blurred in photos . Not a big deal . ”
28182	28193	28212	28212	He	87	“ Uh , that would ’ve been mortifying to me . ”
28194	28204	28205	28205	he	87	“ Seems like a fun Friday night to me , ”
28287	28306	28284	28284	I	0	“ Well , I know that must have been painful for you . Helping me , that is . ”
28382	28394	28395	28395	he	87	“ You might think I do n’t like you , Kelsey , ”
28404	28417	28401	28401	his	87	“ but that ’s not the case at all . I actually — ”
28418	28423	28356	28356	His	87	“ There you are , ”
28433	28459	28356	28356	His	87	“ I saw your brother come in but I did n’t see you . Got a little worried you were going to stand me up . ”

29014	29028	29009	29009	I	0	“ Yeah , I almost fell on my face in front of them . ”

33098	33127	33128	33128	She	793	“ Because he ’s able to pass off the appearance that he ’s with someone , when really he is n’t . Younger brother showmanship type of stuff . ”

33223	33254	33205	33205	she	793	“ So , what was so delightful about Edwin ’s company ? Before he lit up with an onslaught of memories , he seemed like a bit of a bore . ”
33255	33261	33262	33262	Kelsey	89	“ He was n’t boring , ”
33265	33269	33262	33262	Kelsey	89	“ Just different . ”
33270	33276	33283	33283	she	793	“ Different ? How so ? ”
33286	33333	33283	33283	she	793	“ Well , he likes birds , and I found that fascinating . Not the bird facts , that actually was a bit rough at times , but that he was so in tune with nature that he could recognize specific bird chirps of each species . ”
33334	33351	33352	33352	Kelsey	89	“ Is that how he lured you into his bed ? Chirping and flapping his arms ? ”
33363	33400	33352	33352	Kelsey	89	“ For your information , we never went to bed together . Just a kiss . And he ’s not a geek who speaks bird to unhook a bra . He just likes to tell stories . ”
33401	33414	33283	33283	she	793	“ Gathered that from the mundane conversation he shared over the table . ”
33415	33423	33424	33424	Kelsey	89	“ As if Genesis was any better , ”
33427	33436	33424	33424	Kelsey	89	“ What did you even see in her ? ”

33453	33473	33474	33474	She	89	“ At least I was with someone for a purpose . You were with Edwin because you were desperate . ”
33483	33527	33474	33474	She	89	“ I was not desperate . I ’m trying to find my soulmate , you know , someone to fall in love with , not that you could ever relate to that kind of emotion with that cold , lifeless heart of yours . ”
33538	33568	33528	33528	I	0	“ Lifeless , not so much . There ’s quite a steady pulse beating through my soulless veins . Cold , though , now that ’s an accurate description . ”

33637	33642	33643	33643	She	89	“ He did not . ”
33648	33658	33643	33643	She	89	“ Okay , so then what did he say ? ”
33659	33665	33598	33598	her	89	“ Why does it matter ? ”
33666	33714	33715	33715	Her	89	“ Because you say you ’re looking for love . A simple reaction to your appearance tonight would warrant you an answer on where he stands with you . What did he say ? A simple you ’re beautiful ? Maybe a shy . . . wow ? ”
33730	33741	33723	33723	she	89	“ He said I was wearing a nice colored dress . ”

33767	33785	33786	33786	She	89	“ Wait , that ’s all he said ? That you had on a nice colored dress ? ”
34083	34090	34091	34091	JP	87	“ I asked you a question , ”
34104	34114	34101	34101	I	0	“ Uh . . . what was the question ? ”
34115	34130	34101	34101	I	0	“ Edwin , all he said was that you had a nice colored dress ? ”

34307	34312	34304	34304	he	87	“ Dance with me . ”
34618	34630	34631	34631	he	87	“ You know , it would be rude to say no , ”
34634	34654	34631	34631	he	87	“ When a man offers a dance , it ’s the polite thing to do to take his hand . ”
34665	34682	34662	34662	he	87	“ You ca n’t possibly just sit here like a wallflower the rest of the night . ”
34689	34701	34702	34702	He	87	“ Wow , you sure know how to woo a woman . ”
34705	34709	34702	34702	He	87	“ Thank you . ”
34710	34717	34727	34727	he	87	“ That was n’t a compliment . ”

35012	35037	35038	35038	I	0	“ Do n’t flatter yourself . The need to talk to you is out of obligation . These people do n’t actually like you . ”

38201	38212	38213	38213	JP	87	“ He ’s not an idiot , he was just — ”
38238	38257	38230	38230	he	87	“ He ’s an idiot , Kelsey . Do you know how I know he ’s an idiot ? ”
38316	38438	38308	38308	JP	87	“ Edwin is an idiot because he did n’t appreciate something other than the color of your dress . What he should ’ve said the moment he saw you was how fucking breathtaking you look , how the yellow in your dress makes the gold in your eyes sparkle even brighter . He should ’ve lifted your hand and pressed the lightest of kisses to your knuckles , just so he could claim you in front of everyone around him . His eyes never should have strayed from yours . And when he lowered your hand , he should ’ve taken one more step closer to you , leaned inches from your ear , and said how intoxicatingly beautiful you smelled . ”
38692	38704	38682	38682	I	0	“ JP , I ’m not going to sleep with you . ”
38822	38825	38826	38826	he	87	“ Yeah , ”

39039	39046	39047	39047	he	87	“ Do you have your keys ? ”

39766	39782	39750	39750	I	0	“ How about you go back to your office and leave me the hell alone ? ”
39783	39813	39814	39814	My	0	“ You see , I would do that , but we have a meeting in ten minutes and I ca n’t have you acting like a dick in there . ”

39837	39877	39750	39750	I	0	“ Uh , all fucking week . Not to mention , you ’ve been stomping around here with a chip on your shoulder . Everyone ’s aware of your mood and there have been rumblings that people are uncomfortable . ”
39878	39925	39814	39814	My	0	“ Oh , well , Jesus Christ , I should just slap on a happy face , then , should n’t I ? I would n’t want to cause a stir in the office . Heaven forbid someone should have some fucking feelings in this place . ”

39940	39963	39930	39930	Hux	141	“ What the hell is going on ? You ’ve been like this ever since the fundraiser . Is this about Genesis ? ”
40360	40370	40371	40371	I	0	“ Yeah , sure , this is about Genesis , ”
40392	40411	40384	40384	Breaker	97	“ There you are . Hux , I need your signature on a few things before the meeting . ”
40421	40427	40416	40416	Huxley	90	“ This is n’t over . ”
40799	40802	40803	40803	she	161	“ JP , ”
40844	40858	40828	40828	I	0	“ I was n’t aware you were going to be in this meeting . ”
40859	40875	40828	40828	I	0	“ Yeah , well , Huxley sent me eleven messages saying my attendance was required . ”
40876	40887	40828	40828	I	0	“ Do you have any idea what it ’s about ? ”
40888	40891	40892	40892	I	0	“ Nope , ”
40895	40902	40892	40892	I	0	“ Oh . . . okay . ”
40972	40988	40955	40955	I	0	“ Did you , uh , did you see my designs for the Anderson building ? ”
40989	40992	40993	40993	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
40996	41002	40993	40993	I	0	“ Did you like them ? ”
41003	41026	41027	41027	I	0	“ Seemed like everything else you ’ve turned in . Unless I ’m mistaken and you used something other than bamboo storage . ”
41055	41065	41047	41047	her	161	“ JP , if there ’s something I did — ”
41066	41077	41078	41078	I	0	“ You know , I have some emails to answer , ”
41152	41160	41161	41161	she	161	“ I know you ’re ignoring me , ”
41180	41203	41177	41177	I	0	“ Kelsey , I have better things to do with my life than to ignore you . You ’re not that important . ”
41361	41368	41369	41369	Huxley	90	“ We got some news yesterday . ”
41403	41408	41409	41409	Breaker	97	“ Are you pregnant ? ”
41418	41427	41412	41412	Huxley	90	“ No , why would you think that ? ”
41428	41455	41369	41369	Huxley	90	“ Uh , the way you looked at Lottie , the fact that it ’s just family in this room , and the inconspicuous meeting invite . ”
41459	41494	41369	41369	Huxley	90	“ Do you really think I would use company time to announce something like that ? That would be a private affair , not something we ’d do in the conference room at work . ”
41502	41527	41528	41528	Lottie	89	“ Plus , there will be no pregnancy for at least another year . I need a killer honeymoon and babies are n’t invited , ”
41539	41546	41547	41547	I	0	“ Then why are we here ? ”
41550	41588	41547	41547	I	0	“ Because , what I have to say ca n’t be said outside of these walls . It ’s highly classified , therefore , we ’re the only ones who are allowed to know at the moment . ”
41589	41595	41596	41596	I	0	“ Just spit it out , ”
41599	41605	41596	41596	I	0	“ Enough with the dramatics . ”
41628	41653	41606	41606	Huxley	90	“ We got a call from William Edison , our realtor . We won the bid for the historic Angelica Building in San Francisco . ”
41665	41672	41659	41659	Kelsey	89	“ What ’s the Angelica Building ? ”
41673	41733	41734	41734	Huxley	90	“ It ’s one of the most prominent apartment buildings in San Francisco . Currently completely empty because it needs deep renovations . It was put up for sale a few months ago , but instead of simply submitting an offer , we had to submit with accompanying plans as to how we ’d preserve the building during renovations , ”
41737	41743	41744	41744	Breaker	97	“ The building is beautiful , ”
41747	41770	41744	41744	Breaker	97	“ Sits just beyond the Bay and has panoramic views and some of the most intricate marble work I ’ve ever seen . ”
41771	41779	41780	41780	Kelsey	89	“ So why is this a secret ? ”
41783	41847	41848	41848	Huxley	90	“ Because before the news breaks , we want our team to go in , assess , and then draw up plans on how we ’re going to proceed . Once the press finds out , it ’ll be very hard to get our work done in peace without restoration groups knocking at our door , telling us how to do the job . ”
41857	41883	41848	41848	Huxley	90	“ We have two weeks before the deal is announced . I want plans drawn up and contracts made before those two weeks are up . ”
41884	41889	41890	41890	Kelsey	89	“ I ’m sorry , ”
41898	41906	41890	41890	Kelsey	89	“ How does this pertain to me ? ”
41907	41972	41848	41848	Huxley	90	“ We want your input on sustainability for the building . We ’re already in talks with a solar panel specialist to see what our options are for energy , but when it comes to building materials and organization , we want your input as well . Which means , you ’re going to San Francisco tonight to meet with Edison and the team . ”
41973	41976	41977	41977	Kelsey	89	“ Oh . ”
41983	41992	41977	41977	Kelsey	89	“ Okay . Sure , not a problem . ”
41993	42002	41848	41848	Huxley	90	“ And JP will be going with you . ”
42034	42060	42030	42030	I	0	“ Why do I need to go ? I believe this is something Lottie and Kelsey can handle themselves . I ’m not her babysitter . ”
42061	42076	42077	42077	Lottie	89	“ Uh . . . I have a bunch of wedding planning meetings scheduled . ”
42080	42101	42077	42077	Lottie	89	“ I do n’t think I can reschedule anything . I was n’t aware I had to go with Kelsey . ”
42102	42110	42115	42115	his	980	“ You are n’t required to go , ”
42120	42136	42115	42115	his	980	“ Sustainably Organized falls under JP ’s management , which means he ’ll be going . ”
42253	42274	42247	42247	Kelsey	89	“ If JP is busy , I can go on my own . I ’m sure I can handle this . ”
42275	42281	42282	42282	I	0	“ The fuck you can , ”
42316	42362	42309	42309	I	0	“ There ’s more to it than just walking around an office . Hate to say it , but you ’re not sufficiently educated to handle this on your own . This is more like a job for Huxley , given the logistics of it . ”
42409	42422	42406	42406	Huxley	90	“ I have to be at the wedding planning meetings with Lottie . ”
42423	42435	42485	42485	Breaker	97	“ You ’ve had no problem flying back and forth before . ”
42436	42448	42449	42449	Huxley	90	“ What do you not understand about this being your responsibility ? ”
42452	42460	42461	42461	I	0	“ I never asked for this responsibility , ”
42469	42476	42482	42482	his	97	“ Why does n’t he go ? ”
42492	42548	42487	42487	his	97	“ Why the hell would I go when Kelsey works with you ? I have no fucking clue what you guys are doing over there with the buildings and all the environmental changes happening in this office . All I know is that my water comes in an aluminum can now and I like it . ”
42555	42585	42549	42549	He	97	“ Dude , what the fuck is going on ? You love San Francisco , and this is your job , so why do n’t you want to go ? ”
42639	42645	42646	42646	I	0	“ I ca n’t go , ”
42658	42671	42646	42646	I	0	“ I have . . . things to do . Important things . ”
42727	42735	42722	42722	I	0	“ Things that ca n’t be rescheduled . ”
42736	42742	42743	42743	Breaker	97	“ What kind of things ? ”
42752	42756	42757	42757	I	0	“ Important things , ”
42760	42773	42757	42757	I	0	“ But what kind of important things ? Give us an example . ”
42827	42830	42831	42831	I	0	“ Appointments , ”
42841	42858	42831	42831	I	0	“ The kind of appointments I do n’t care to discuss in front of the ladies . ”
42915	42931	42932	42932	Breaker	97	“ An appointment you do n’t want to talk about in front of the ladies ? ”
42935	42948	42932	42932	Breaker	97	“ Like . . . are you having man troubles , dude ? ”
43061	43080	43058	43058	Huxley	90	“ Tell me right now something is wrong with your dick or you ’re going to San Francisco . ”
43122	43133	43117	43117	Huxley	90	“ That ’s what I thought . You ’re going . ”
43148	43172	43117	43117	Huxley	90	“ You leave tonight . I had Karla call ahead to the penthouse . It ’s already been cleaned and stocked with food . ”
43203	43225	43197	43197	he	998	“ Do you really think the penthouse is necessary ? A simple hotel room will do , do n’t you think ? ”
43226	43232	43233	43233	Kelsey	89	“ What ’s the penthouse ? ”
43236	43242	43243	43243	Huxley	90	“ Housing the company owns , ”
43246	43311	43243	43243	Huxley	90	“ And , yes , the penthouse is necessary . You will be much more comfortable there . We ’ve already set up a car service , and Karla is working on scheduling meetings with our architect and contractors . If we ’re sending you up there , we want to make the most of our time . The trip will last two weeks . ”
43312	43316	43317	43317	I	0	“ Two weeks ? ”
43320	43347	43317	43317	I	0	“ You want us to be up there for two weeks ? I thought we just had a two - week limit to turn things in . ”
43461	43519	43522	43522	he	1007	“ You will be there for two weeks . I expect to receive daily reports on all decisions . And while you ’re up there , make sure you set up meetings with the mayor . You ’re the media relations for this company , after all , JP , the face . Do n’t forget it . ”
43540	43547	43534	43534	I	0	“ When does the plane leave ? ”
43548	43557	43534	43534	I	0	“ Six sharp . Do n’t be late . ”
43558	43565	43566	43566	I	0	“ Would n’t dream of it . ”
43855	43864	43865	43865	he	1021	“ What the actual fuck was that about ? ”
43868	43871	43865	43865	he	1021	“ Me ? ”
43877	43920	43865	43865	he	1021	“ You do n’t think you could ’ve told me that in private ? You know , so we could discuss it without the girls being there ? Instead , you just gave me a sentencing and went on with your life . ”
43921	43924	43925	43925	Huxley	90	“ Sentencing ? ”
43928	43964	43925	43925	Huxley	90	“ I fail to see how spending two weeks in a penthouse in San Francisco , one of your favorite cities , is a sentencing . I assumed you ’d appreciate the break from LA . ”
43965	43976	43977	43977	I	0	“ Not when I have to spend it babysitting someone , ”
43980	43986	43987	43987	Breaker	97	“ It ’s not babysitting , ”
43990	44014	43987	43987	Breaker	97	“ You ’d be helping Kelsey and taking on one of our most prestigious renovation projects . This is fucking huge , man . ”
44015	44074	43925	43925	Huxley	90	“ Not to mention , we ’re working with a new set of contractors in San Francisco because that ’s who was available . They know how much we ’re worth and they know the importance of the project . We do n’t need them taking advantage of Kelsey , who is n’t experienced in this at all . ”
44075	44087	44088	44088	I	0	“ You do n’t think she can stand up for herself ? ”
44091	44112	44088	44088	I	0	“ Because I have it on very good authority that she knows how to put a man in his place . ”
44125	44136	44137	44137	Huxley	90	“ It ’s not that she ca n’t handle herself , ”
44140	44226	44137	44137	Huxley	90	“ Because if she ’s anything like her sister , then I know there ’s a solid fighting spirit in her . But this is about headlining the process as an owner , making sure things are done the way we want them , and assisting Kelsey with her initiatives . We have one shot at impressing the historic societies in a city we love . If we can make good on this building , think of all the other buildings we could help with . ”
44227	44240	44241	44241	Huxley	90	“ If it ’s that important , then you fucking do it . ”
44248	44327	44241	44241	Huxley	90	“ You know I ca n’t . I have commitments with Lottie , and even though this company means everything to me , she means more . You ’re the one who represents Cane Enterprises , you ’re the one who works directly with Kelsey , and unless you can give me a specific — and I mean very specific — reason why you ca n’t go up there tonight , then you ’re leaving in four hours . ”
44524	44538	44543	44543	their	1029	“ Well , then , I guess I ’m leaving in four hours . ”
44613	44659	44660	44660	Lottie	89	“ — I ’m sure it wo n’t be that bad , as there are two large rooms , separated by a living area and kitchenette . So , do n’t worry . Hey , remember the time we went to San Francisco with Mom ? ”
44663	44700	44701	44701	Kelsey	89	“ She took us to that dim sum restaurant and we ate so much that the owners took a picture of us because they ’d never seen two girls consume as much food as we did . ”
44704	44715	44701	44701	Kelsey	89	“ What was it called again ? Dim Sum Star ? ”
44765	44804	44762	44762	Lottie	89	“ Yup . It was so good . And , of course , the Ghirardelli store . You have to go . Oh , and hey , kind of convenient that Derek will be up there , right ? ”
44822	44836	44820	44820	Derek	166	“ Oh yeah , you ’re right . This trip already sounds better . ”
44837	44868	44869	44869	Ellie	167	“ Want me to text Ellie and see if he ’ll meet you for dinner ? I mean , it ’s kind of perfect that the timing ’s matched up . ”
44930	44942	44943	44943	Kelsey	89	“ Might be nice to have something to do at night , ”
44988	44995	44996	44996	Lottie	89	“ I ’ll set it up , ”
44999	45024	44996	44996	Lottie	89	“ Ellie was telling me that Derek is a total foodie . I ’ll bet he takes you somewhere that will blow your mind . ”
45025	45040	45041	45041	Kelsey	89	“ Which means I need to pack some dresses for a date or two , ”
45632	45646	45650	45651	the staff	1080	“ good luck to the flight staff in removing me from this plane . ”
45786	45788	45795	45795	His	87	“ finger ”
45804	45815	45816	45816	Ronda	173	“ Can I get you anything else , Mr. Cane ? ”
45825	45830	45831	45831	he	87	“ I ’m good , ”
45845	45856	45839	45839	She	173	“ Miss Gardner , can I grab you another cookie ? ”
45897	45905	45887	45887	I	0	“ I do n’t think I should . ”
45917	45937	45909	45909	her	173	“ How about this ? I ’ll pack some up in a bag for you to take with you . ”
45945	45954	45955	45955	She	173	“ You ’re an absolute angel , Ronda . ”
46035	46050	46051	46051	I	0	“ You know . . . you could be a little nicer to Ronda , ”
46063	46071	46072	46072	he	87	“ I ’m perfectly pleasant to her , ”
46082	46103	46072	46072	he	87	“ I have n’t heard any pleases or thank yous from you . Politeness goes a long way , JP . ”
46104	46112	46151	46151	his	87	“ Are you the polite police now ? ”
46113	46147	46148	46148	He	87	“ No , but I do think we need to hold each other accountable for our actions and , frankly , I do n’t think you ’re being very kind at the moment . ”
46169	46195	46157	46157	he	87	“ Have I told her to fuck off ? Have I tripped her on purpose ? Did I punch her at any point in time ? ”
46205	46218	46202	46202	he	87	“ Did n’t think so . Now , get off my back . ”
46235	46263	46202	46202	he	87	“ Well , you could stand to be nicer to me , that ’s for sure . You know , we have to spend two weeks together . ”
46264	46273	46202	46202	he	87	“ I ’m well aware of my sentencing . ”
46274	46277	46278	46278	I	0	“ Sentencing ? ”
46284	46329	46278	46278	I	0	“ That ’s what this is to you ? A sentencing ? Because , to me , it seems like a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to help restore a building to its glory days while making it modern and sustainable . ”
46340	46356	46332	46332	his	87	“ Of course you ’d put some sort of fairy - tale spin on it . ”
46357	46371	46202	46202	he	87	“ It ’s not a fairy tale . This is a huge opportunity . ”
46372	46485	46332	46332	his	87	“ I ’ll tell you what this trip is going to be , Kelsey . We ’re going to have to share a penthouse for two weeks , which I know wo n’t be big enough to stay out of each other ’s hair . You ’ll follow me around to different meetings , I ’ll get to hear you say the same spiel repeatedly about how using bamboo organizers are so much healthier for the earth than the plastic ones , and you ’ll get all excited about everyone else ’s excitement . Meanwhile , I ’m counting down the minutes until I can return to my normal life in LA . ”
46497	46526	46494	46494	I	0	“ Or you can use it as a chance to get to know me better . You know , the option to be a friend is still there . ”
46527	46539	46540	46540	he	87	“ Why the fuck would you want to be my friend ? ”
46543	46549	46550	46550	I	0	“ Why would n’t I ? ”
46560	46598	46550	46550	I	0	“ I ’m an obnoxious asshole in your opinion . You think I ’m some sort of sycophant who preys on women when they ’re at their lowest . Why would you want to be my friend ? ”
46599	46607	46635	46635	he	87	“ When have I ever said that ? ”
46608	46615	46616	46616	he	87	“ You did n’t have to , ”
46619	46628	46616	46616	he	87	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
46638	46665	46635	46635	he	87	“ The night of the gala . You assumed I was trying to take you to bed . Could n’t have been further from the truth . ”
46733	46808	46810	46810	they	1090	“ What he should ’ve said the moment he saw you was how fucking breathtaking you look . . . He should ’ve lifted your hand and pressed the lightest of kisses to your knuckles , just so he could claim you in front of everyone around him . . . And when he lowered your hand , he should ’ve leaned inches from your ear , and said how intoxicatingly beautiful you smelled . ”
46845	46869	46837	46837	he	87	“ But you took me back to your place . If you were n’t trying to do that then what were you doing ? ”
46870	46874	46875	46875	he	87	“ Being nice , ”
46878	46906	46875	46875	he	87	“ Something , apparently , you do n’t think I can be . Your opinion of me is so low , that you believe only the worst . ”
46907	46912	46913	46913	I	0	“ But . . . ”
46927	46934	46913	46913	I	0	“ Just forget it , Kelsey . ”
46935	46946	46875	46875	he	87	“ No , JP , let ’s talk about this . ”
46947	46983	46986	46986	he	87	“ I do n’t want to be on this airplane right now , so do you really think I want to talk about that night ? I do n’t . So , fucking drop it . ”
47252	47288	47249	47249	his	87	“ The fuck you can . There ’s more to it than just walking around an office . Hate to say it , but you ’re not sufficiently educated to handle this on your own . ”
47323	47330	47331	47331	JP	87	“ What room do you want ? ”
47359	47361	47351	47351	his	87	“ everything ”
47515	47525	47526	47526	I	0	“ I do n’t mind . Whichever is fine , ”
47555	47560	47561	47561	he	87	“ Just choose one , ”
47568	47575	47561	47561	he	87	“ Fine , the right one . ”
47576	47579	47580	47580	JP	87	“ Good . ”
47592	47611	47582	47582	his	87	“ Ronda ordered us dinner . Should be here any moment . Just start eating whenever you want . ”
47758	47769	47770	47770	Lottie	89	“ Gah ! Did you make it to San Francisco ? ”
47778	47802	47770	47770	Lottie	89	“ I did and , oh my God , Lottie , this place is so beautiful . I ca n’t get over it . ”
47803	47846	47773	47773	she	89	“ I ’m so jealous . I told Hux when you two are done there , we need to at least take a weekend trip , because he was showing me pictures of the penthouse and it looks like a total dream . ”
47847	47867	47773	47773	she	89	“ It is . I ca n’t wait to see what kind of views I have in the morning . ”
47868	47875	47770	47770	Lottie	89	“ And the flight was good ? ”
47876	47884	47773	47773	she	89	“ As good as it could be . ”
47885	47888	47889	47889	she	89	“ Turbulence ? ”
47892	47915	47889	47889	she	89	“ Well , not turbulence with the plane , more like turbulence with JP . He ’s really not happy with me . ”
47916	47926	47773	47773	she	89	“ I gathered that . Did he say why ? ”
47942	47957	47936	47936	you	1117	“ He did and , honestly , Lottie , I feel sick about it . ”
47958	47962	47773	47773	she	89	“ What happened ? ”
47963	47983	47889	47889	she	89	“ Well , you know how Edwin and Genesis went off with each other the night of the gala ? ”
47984	48005	47936	47936	you	1117	“ Ah , yes , and you have n’t heard from him since . A real winner , that one . ”
48006	48021	47773	47773	she	89	“ Yeah , well , I did n’t really tell you what happened after . ”
48022	48045	47889	47889	she	89	“ What do you mean you did n’t tell me — oh my God , Kelsey , did you sleep with JP ? ”
48046	48049	48050	48050	I	0	“ No ! ”
48082	48131	48068	48068	I	0	“ We did n’t sleep together , but he did take me back to his place , and when I say his place , I mean the driveway . That ’s as far as I let it go before I told him I was n’t sleeping with him . ”
48132	48141	47889	47889	she	89	“ Did he ask you into his house ? ”
48142	48211	48068	48068	I	0	“ No , I kind of . . . you know . . . assumed that he wanted to sleep with me . But he was just being nice . I inadvertently insulted him and now he pretty much hates me . He barely talked to me on the airplane , and has retreated to his room , where I ’m sure he ’ll stay the entire night . ”
48212	48224	48068	48068	I	0	“ So , you ’re in an uncomfortable situation , then ? ”
48225	48228	48229	48229	I	0	“ Correct . ”
48251	48292	48229	48229	I	0	“ I really want to enjoy myself here . We ’ve rarely been able to travel , let alone in a lavish way , but things are weird with him and I do n’t know how to make it better . ”
48293	48370	48371	48371	I	0	“ JP is an odd one . He ’s very sarcastic , and sometimes , it seems like he does n’t take things seriously , but there ’s a darker side to him , too , a side he does n’t talk about much . Even Huxley was saying how JP can be very closed off . I think you struck that dark part and maybe the only way to fix things is to apologize sincerely . ”
48384	48391	48371	48371	I	0	“ I think you ’re right . ”
48392	48438	48229	48229	I	0	“ I know I am . Oh , and hey , I talked to Ellie . Derek would love to meet up while you ’re in San Francisco . He ’s going to check his schedule and will let you know when he ’s available . ”
48439	48446	48229	48229	I	0	“ Okay , yeah , cool . ”
48483	48494	48229	48229	I	0	“ I should go . Dinner will be here soon . ”
48495	48512	48525	48525	his	87	“ You got this , sis . Show them what the Gardner sisters are all about . ”
48606	48618	48600	48600	I	0	“ JP , are you in there ? Dinner is here . ”
48632	48637	48627	48627	he	87	“ Eat without me . ”
48661	48699	48649	48649	I	0	“ Okay , but , uh , I think I broke the oven and it sort of smells like gas so do you think you could help me with that ? Then I ’ll leave you alone . ”
48857	48865	48848	48848	I	0	“ Kelsey . . . the oven . ”
48866	48869	48870	48870	I	0	“ Right , ”
48878	48889	48870	48870	I	0	“ The oven . Gas . It smells like gas . ”
49049	49058	49059	49059	he	87	“ What did you do to the oven ? ”
49169	49173	49166	49166	I	0	“ I lied . ”
49184	49188	49189	49189	he	87	“ You lied ? ”
49198	49201	49195	49195	his	87	“ Indeed . ”
49210	49224	49202	49202	I	0	“ The oven story is a farce . I never even touched it . ”
49225	49229	49230	49230	he	87	“ Jesus Christ , ”
49327	49333	49334	49334	he	87	“ What are you doing ? ”
49359	49374	49337	49337	he	87	“ Stopping you from retreating to your room . What does it look like ? ”
49375	49404	49434	49434	He	87	“ It looks like a pathetic attempt to get in my way . With one push of my pinky , I will have you flat on your ass . ”
49405	49418	49423	49423	he	87	“ I ’m much stronger than I let on . Try me . ”
49602	49607	49608	49608	he	87	“ What the fuck ? ”
49655	49665	49650	49650	my	0	“ Kelsey , what the hell are you doing ? ”
49686	49706	49683	49683	I	0	“ You ’re not getting away from me , sir . No way . You will talk to me . ”
49707	49711	49712	49712	He	87	“ Let go . ”
49725	49728	49729	49729	I	0	“ Never ! ”
49733	49751	49729	49729	I	0	“ If you want me off you , you ’re going to have to pry me off . ”
49822	49832	49816	49816	I	0	“ Kelsey , seriously , let the fuck go . ”
49833	49898	49899	49899	He	87	“ You have no idea who you ’re dealing with . I have no problem claiming squatter ’s rights on your leg . I have nowhere to be all night . It ’s just you and me , bub , so it ’s your choice . You either come talk to me , or you spend your evening with me attached to your foot . ”
49933	49943	49944	49944	He	87	“ JP , I demand you stop at once . ”
49957	49962	49948	49948	He	87	“ Stop this insanity , ”
49967	49973	49963	49963	I	0	“ Just talk to me . ”
50227	50238	50224	50224	JP	87	“ What . . . the . . . fuuuuuuck ? ”
50415	50419	50420	50420	he	87	“ Jesus fuck , ”
50442	50445	50446	50446	I	0	“ Ahhh ! ”
50454	50469	50446	50446	I	0	“ Your penis is on my face . Your penis is on my face . ”
50470	50476	50477	50477	he	87	“ I know . Fuck , ”
50486	50492	50477	50477	he	87	“ Where is your underwear ? ”
50493	50502	50446	50446	I	0	“ I do n’t wear underwear at night . ”
50503	50522	50446	50446	I	0	“ Dear God ! It ’s on my nose ! Your genitals are resting on my freaking nose ! ”
50523	50528	50529	50529	he	87	“ I fucking know ! ”
50533	50549	50529	50529	he	87	“ But I ca n’t get up because you ’re still holding on to me . ”
50550	50558	50559	50559	I	0	“ I ’ve been tea - bagged , ”
50573	50581	50559	50559	I	0	“ Let the fuck GO , KELSEY ! ”
50624	50630	50610	50610	my	0	“ I ’ve been defiled . ”
50631	50637	50638	50638	he	87	“ You ’ve been defiled ? ”
50641	50652	50638	50638	he	87	“ I ’m the one who ’s been stripped bare . ”
50740	50797	50735	50735	he	87	“ Let ’s get one thing straight , Kelsey . I ’m not here to be friends with you , nor am I here to try to solve any sort of complex you might have about not being liked . I ’m here to do a job and I ’d prefer you just leave me alone . ”
50812	50815	50803	50803	his	87	“ Christ , ”
50965	50983	50984	50984	Kelsey	89	“ You know , maybe we should discuss what we ’re going to say in the meeting , ”
51594	51600	51601	51601	Kelsey	89	“ Did you hear me ? ”
51653	51656	51664	51664	she	89	“ Hey — ”
51675	51684	51664	51664	she	89	“ Listen to me , Jonathan Patrick Cane — ”
51685	51692	51658	51658	her	89	“ That ’s not my name . ”
51693	51713	51658	51658	her	89	“ I do n’t care if your name is Junior Pooper , you ’re going to listen to me . ”
51725	51772	51664	51664	she	89	“ I ’m sick of you ignoring me . Let ’s call last night what it was , a total miss on my end . I ’ll take the blame for how things . . . panned out , but now you ’re just being cruel . ”
51773	51791	51658	51658	her	89	“ I ’m not being cruel . I just do n’t have anything to say to you . ”
51792	51863	51866	51866	her	1167	“ You always have something to say to me . Always . From the moment I freaking met you , you ’ve had something to say . You ’ve never stopped talking , nagging , prodding . You ’re constantly in my ear chattering about utter nonsense , and now , all of a sudden , you ’re going to stop ? When we have to spend two weeks together ? ”
51869	51939	51866	51866	her	1167	“ Oh no , that ’s not how this is going to work . I would rather spend two weeks in a penthouse with you constantly aggravating me with your nonsensical drivel than this silent treatment you ’ve decided to try out . You might not think it ’s cruel , but it is . It ’s not fair to me . You wo n’t even let me apologize . ”
51940	51945	51946	51946	I	0	“ Apologize for what ? ”
51949	51969	51946	51946	I	0	“ For my presumption the night of the gala . What I said was out of line , JP . ”
51978	52015	51970	51970	She	1167	“ I ’m sorry . You were right , you were being nice and I took it the wrong way . I never should ’ve made that kind of assumption about you . I ’m sorry . ”
52047	52050	52052	52052	she	1167	“ nagging , ”
52202	52208	52209	52209	I	0	“ Thank you for apologizing , ”
52230	52242	52223	52223	I	0	“ Uh . . . that ’s it ? Nothing else ? ”
52243	52253	52299	52300	the driver	653	“ What else do you want me to say ? ”
52254	52270	52271	52272	The driver	653	“ I do n’t know — make a joke about how I tickled your balls ? ”
52302	52315	52293	52293	I	0	“ She did n’t tickle my balls . She breathed on them . ”
52316	52321	52322	52322	Kelsey	89	“ Not on purpose ! ”
52338	52345	52326	52326	she	89	“ He fell on my face . ”
52346	52352	52326	52326	she	89	“ After she pantsed me . ”
52353	52373	52326	52326	she	89	“ It ’s not my fault you were n’t wearing underwear . How was I supposed to know that ? ”
52374	52410	52411	52411	I	0	“ Either way , you should n’t have been pulling on my shorts , unless . . . that was your plan all along . Trying to get me naked to sit on your face . ”
52418	52427	52411	52411	I	0	“ Wow , Kelsey , job well done . ”
52448	52476	52444	52444	I	0	“ You know damn well my intention was n’t to get you naked to sit on my face . I could n’t imagine a more grotesque situation . ”
52477	52487	52488	52488	I	0	“ Did n’t seem to mind it last night , ”
52506	52513	52497	52497	She	89	“ Hey , stop doing that . ”
52514	52537	52497	52497	She	89	“ I did not enjoy your balls on my face . I specifically remember screaming and telling you to get off me . ”
52538	52547	52548	52548	She	89	“ Yeah , as you held me down . ”
52576	52629	52564	52564	I	0	“ I did not hold him down . I was flustered and did n’t know what was happening . When I realized what was on my face , I got up immediately . I just want you to know I ’m not the kind of girl who enjoys balls on her face . ”
52630	52635	52636	52636	I	0	“ Such a shame , ”
52660	52675	52639	52639	She	89	“ Why do I even bother talking to you ? You ’re so infuriating . ”
52676	52698	52699	52699	I	0	“ Beats me . You ’re the one who did n’t want the silent treatment , so this is your choice . ”
52721	52725	52713	52713	I	0	“ Nice try . ”
52748	52753	52743	52743	She	89	“ It ’s Huxley . ”
52754	52760	52770	52770	she	89	“ Put it on speaker . ”
52773	52808	52770	52770	she	89	“ I swear to God , JP , if you bring up the balls on the face thing with him , I ’ll legit haunt you in your sleep . Do you understand me ? ”
52809	52812	52813	52813	I	0	“ Sure , ”
52861	52867	52856	52856	she	89	“ Good morning , Huxley . ”
52893	52899	52885	52885	she	89	“ Good morning , Kelsey . ”
52900	52923	52851	52851	he	1178	“ I have you on speakerphone so JP can hear you . We ’re on our way to the meeting right now . ”
52924	52940	52976	52976	He	1180	“ I take it you two have settled in since the activities of last night ? ”
52941	52948	52949	52949	she	89	“ Oh my God , JP , ”
52956	52969	52949	52949	she	89	“ You told your brother that your penis landed on my face ? ”
53016	53019	53020	53020	Huxley	90	“ What ? ”
53038	53046	53047	53047	I	0	“ I did n’t tell him anything . ”
53050	53056	53047	53047	I	0	“ But you just did . ”
53057	53063	53064	53064	she	89	“ Oh , dear God , ”
53067	53086	53064	53064	she	89	“ What ’s going on ? JP , if you fuck with her , I ’m going to — ”
53087	53093	53094	53094	Kelsey	89	“ No , nothing happened , ”
53098	53169	53094	53094	Kelsey	89	“ It was just a , uh , scramble , and then we tripped on each other , and I really mean that , not like , ‘ Oops I tripped and fell on his penis , my bad . ’ I swear , this was just an unfortunate incident and it was quickly rectified with screaming , yelling , and swatting . There ’s no funny business between us . ”
53170	53175	53176	53176	I	0	“ She ’s correct , ”
53179	53204	53176	53176	I	0	“ Nothing is going on , and trust me , nothing will be going on . You do n’t have to worry about that . ”

53294	53324	53283	53292	a pathetic loser who jacks off to a simple exhalation	1154	“ He ’s been nothing but professional . Do n’t worry . Just forget I even mentioned it . Anyway , we ’re on our way to the meeting . ”
53325	53367	53259	53259	Her	1182	“ Good . Edison will meet with the both of you , along with our general contractor , Regis . He ’s new , JP . I ’ve heard mixed reviews on the man , so keep an eye on him . ”
53368	53378	53379	53379	I	0	“ Then why the hell did you hire him ? ”
53382	53410	53379	53379	I	0	“ Time . Darius could n’t squeeze us in . But Regis has done beautiful work around the city , so that ’s why we hired him . ”
53411	53418	53419	53419	I	0	“ Has everyone signed an NDA ? ”
53422	53482	53419	53419	I	0	“ Yes . Edison has some details to go over before you walk the property . Since he has experience in renovating historic buildings in the area , I asked him to be a voice while going through the plans . He has no problem doing that . Did you get the renovation plans that I emailed last night ? ”
53483	53486	53487	53487	I	0	“ Yes , ”
53490	53502	53487	53487	I	0	“ I ’m assuming you sent them to Regis as well ? ”
53503	53506	53507	53507	Huxley	90	“ Correct , ”
53510	53588	53507	53507	Huxley	90	“ Kelsey , I sent them to you as well . I want you to insert your input like you have for the rest of our buildings . I know this is new to you , starting from scratch , but I think it ’s important to have you there to oversee our plans for sustainability . Karla also scheduled meetings for you around town with the other buildings that we own , did you see that ? ”
53589	53621	53487	53487	I	0	“ I did . I ’m assuming you want me to walk through them , speak with the office managers , and organize like I ’ve been doing in Los Angeles ? ”
53622	53639	53487	53487	I	0	“ Correct . You have a busy two weeks . Hope you ’re up for it . ”
53640	53644	53645	53645	Kelsey	89	“ I am , ”
53650	53759	53645	53645	Kelsey	89	“ JP , plan a meeting with the mayor . Tell him exactly what we plan on doing . He ’s been wary of us coming into his city , but if he sees what we stand for , it might help for future bids . When I said we were lucky to get the Angelica Building , I was n’t fucking lying . If done right , this could be huge for us . We ’ve been involved in restoration for a few years now , but nothing of this magnitude . Mixing the old with the new could put us at the top of the game . ”
53760	53813	53814	53814	Kelsey	89	“ Well , I ’m excited . I think it ’s an awesome plan , preserving the brilliance of the old - school architecture , but also combining today ’s trends to help with costs , as well as making positive changes to help our environment . It ’s a worthwhile combination , ”
53817	53850	53814	53814	Kelsey	89	“ I ’ve been doing research on the structure and identity of the Angelica and I already have a ton of ideas . I ca n’t wait to walk through them all . ”
53851	53861	53873	53873	she	89	“ Good . Do you two have any questions ? ”
53862	53869	53873	53873	she	89	“ I do n’t think so , ”
53885	53898	53873	53873	she	89	“ Seems like we ’re good . Thanks for calling , Huxley . ”
53899	53922	53873	53873	she	89	“ Anytime . If you need anything , ask JP . That ’s why he ’s there , to help you out . ”
53923	53928	53873	53873	she	89	“ Okay , thanks . ”
53960	53974	53940	53940	She	89	“ Hear that , JP ? You ’re here to help me out . ”
53975	53979	53980	53980	I	0	“ Your point ? ”
53990	54001	53980	53980	I	0	“ Which means . . . no more ignoring me . ”
54002	54042	54056	54057	the receptionist	1186	“ If you have something productive to say or a well - thought - out question , I ’ll be more than happy to be at your service . Anything other than that . . . just move along . ”
54046	54055	54056	54057	the receptionist	1186	“ Mr. Edison will be right with you , ”
54085	54094	54095	54095	Kelsey	89	“ This place is . . . interesting , ”
54098	54112	54095	54095	Kelsey	89	“ Is that a chair in the shape of a hand over there ? ”
54113	54116	54117	54117	I	0	“ Yup , ”
54146	54185	54135	54135	I	0	“ Edison believes he has a refined palate when it comes to interior design . When in fact , he has zero taste . Wait until you see his desk . It ’s one giant Rubik ’s Cube . ”
54186	54194	54130	54130	she	1186	“ That ’s . . . interesting . ”
54195	54202	54135	54135	I	0	“ One way to put it . ”
54295	54309	54292	54292	his	1190	“ JP Cane , you old bastard . How the hell are ya ? ”
54331	54356	54357	54357	He	1190	“ Edison , good to see you . I see you ’re still unable to match a pair of slacks with a suit jacket . ”
54366	54391	54357	54357	He	1190	“ Not all of us want to be caught up in a sea of black suits . Some of us like to be memorable . ”
54392	54397	54398	54398	I	0	“ Memorable , indeed , ”
54428	54430	54425	54425	I	0	“ face ”
54529	54536	54526	54526	Edison	182	“ You must be Kelsey Gardner . ”
54537	54540	54541	54541	Kelsey	86	“ Hello , ”
54549	54560	54541	54541	Kelsey	86	“ It ’s nice to meet you , Mr. Edison . ”
54561	54602	54634	54634	his	182	“ Edison is fine , dear . No need to add the mister in front of it . I ’m sure JP could regale you with stories of how such a formal title would not suit me and my personality . ”
54603	54615	54616	54616	I	0	“ I could , but I ’ll save you the embarrassment , ”
54625	54630	54631	54631	Edison	182	“ A kind man . ”
54637	54653	54631	54631	Edison	182	“ Please , come in . Regis said he ’d meet us at the Angelica . ”
54900	54908	54909	54909	Edison	182	“ Can I get you a drink ? ”
54938	54943	54944	54944	Kelsey	86	“ I ’m good , ”
54951	54959	54960	54960	I	0	“ I ’m good , as well , ”
54963	54972	54960	54960	I	0	“ Edison , your office is so unique . ”
54973	54983	54984	54984	I	0	“ That ’s a nice way of putting it , ”
54992	55001	54984	54984	I	0	“ More like a garage sale for misfits . ”
55002	55014	55015	55015	Edison	182	“ Hey now , you said you liked the Zelda poster , ”
55025	55041	55022	55022	I	0	“ I did . The teenage boy in me was jealous when I saw it . ”
55042	55053	55054	55054	Edison	182	“ Never too old to be prancing around the forest . ”
55060	55088	55056	55056	his	182	“ Okay , we should get to work , or else that brother of yours is going to have a conniption that we did n’t accomplish anything . ”
55089	55095	55096	55096	I	0	“ Ca n’t have that . ”
55102	55120	55096	55096	I	0	“ First thing ’s first . . . Regis is n’t going to like working with Kelsey . ”
55134	55140	55141	55141	I	0	“ Why the hell not ? ”
55163	55211	55153	55153	Edison	182	“ I ’ve worked with him a few times . He ’s a great guy , does amazing work , but when it comes to renovations , he has a certain esthetic . He likes things done his way , and sustainability is n’t in his wheelhouse . ”
55212	55222	55257	55257	Kelsey	86	“ Did Huxley know this when he hired him ? ”
55223	55238	55257	55257	Kelsey	86	“ I warned him . He said you ’d be able to handle it . ”
55239	55245	55246	55246	I	0	“ Of course he did . ”
55262	55279	55246	55246	I	0	“ What kind of trouble are we talking here ? How much grief will this cause ? ”
55280	55293	55294	55294	Edison	182	“ Enough to make you want to go back to Los Angeles . ”
55297	55300	55301	55301	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
55304	55315	55316	55316	Kelsey	86	“ Hold on , it might not be that bad , ”
55319	55374	55316	55316	Kelsey	86	“ I can be quite agreeable and accommodating . I think we need to give Regis the benefit of the doubt first . He does n’t know what my plans are and I do n’t know what his plans are , so maybe we go into this blind and just see how it goes . ”
55618	55628	55629	55629	Regis	180	“ Do you realize how old these windows are ? ”
55632	55648	55629	55629	Regis	180	“ These are casement windows , very rare . You ca n’t possibly replace them . ”
55649	55693	55594	55594	Edison	182	“ But do n’t you see ? They ca n’t even swing all the way open due to building code , and because they ’re original to the building , they do n’t have any insulation , meaning they have zero energy efficiency . ”
55694	55707	55708	55708	Kelsey	86	“ You ca n’t possibly be proposing to remove all of them ? ”
55713	55726	55727	55727	Regis	180	“ I am . I ’ve already written it in my notes . ”
55733	55756	55727	55727	Regis	180	“ And what do you suppose you do with the windows ? Toss them in a landfill ? How sustainable is that ? ”
55766	55769	55770	55770	Kelsey	86	“ Actually , ”
55778	55867	55770	55770	Kelsey	86	“ I was going to suggest that we refurbish them and use them throughout the building . Since they ’re looking to make this into apartment buildings , you can fashion the old windows as room dividers in the individual apartments , or in the common spaces like in the laundry room . I ’d never suggest we toss anything into a landfill . As a matter of fact , I believe I ’ll talk to Huxley about an approval process . Nothing is tossed without our permission . ”
55878	55897	55876	55876	Kelsey	86	“ Do you understand the cost of replacing all these windows ? These casings are n’t standard size . ”
55898	55946	55979	55979	Regis	180	“ Do you understand the type of impact we ’ll have if we do change them ? The energy costs for the entire building ? Actually , can you add installing a geothermal system for heat to your list ? That will definitely cut costs on energy . ”
55947	55978	55979	55979	Regis	180	“ And where do you suppose we dig for a geothermal system ? If you have n’t noticed , we ’re in the middle of the city . Jesus Christ . ”
55987	55993	55979	55979	Regis	180	“ JP , a word . ”
56032	56051	56026	56026	Kelsey	86	“ When he ’s done having a word , I ’d like to have a word as well . ”
56052	56056	56057	56057	I	0	“ About what ? ”
56071	56094	56065	56066	Middle man	1220	“ About what he ’s going to complain to you about . I need to know what he ’s saying about me . ”
56095	56099	56100	56100	I	0	“ Paranoid much ? ”
56103	56111	56100	56100	I	0	“ You know it ’s about me . ”
56117	56135	56112	56112	Her	86	“ And if someone ’s trying to get me fired , I ’d like to know why . ”
56136	56143	56144	56144	I	0	“ I think you know why . ”
56193	56205	56206	56206	Regis	180	“ You ca n’t be fucking serious with this sustainable crap , ”
56209	56284	56206	56206	Regis	180	“ This is a historic building , so you ca n’t strip it down and make it modern . Activists for the historic buildings in this city will have a field day with this , and I ’m telling you right now , if I had n’t signed an NDA , I ’d be headed to one of their meetings to let them know the kind of asinine ideas that woman out there has . ”
56289	56294	56285	56285	I	0	“ face of the company ”
56300	56437	56285	56285	I	0	“ I understand your concerns about the integrity of the building , Regis . And we ’re just as concerned as you are . Preserving the history within these walls is just as vital to us as it is to you . But you need to know something . Kelsey is my colleague , and I will not tolerate you talking about her like that . She deserves just as much respect as the next person you work with . In addition , she ’s right . If we ’re going to open this building up to the public for the first time in over thirty years , we need to do it right . We need to make sure we meet today ’s needs with yesterday ’s intricate designs . Compromise , man , okay ? ”
56438	56475	56579	56579	Regis	180	“ There ’s no possible way we can do a geothermal heating system . I ’ll cave on the windows if they ’re being utilized elsewhere , but the heating system ca n’t physically be done . ”
56476	56541	56542	56542	I	0	“ Okay , then maybe we can come up with another solution . I know this is our first time working together , but this is n’t Kelsey ’s first time working with us . We value her opinion and ideas and I need you to do the same , or else we ’ll have to find someone else who can see our vision . ”
56549	56578	56542	56542	I	0	“ And you wo n’t want to miss out on working with us , especially with the kinds of plans we have for the future . Got it ? ”
56702	56713	56714	56714	I	0	“ I think we ’ve done enough talking for today , ”
56717	56763	56764	56764	Regis	180	“ We ’ve walked the building ; we ’ve taken notes . How about you both write up your ideas according to Huxley ’s plans , how we can get it done , and then we can reconvene sometime in the next couple of days ? ”
56832	56855	56856	56856	I	0	“ JP , I ca n’t tell you how thankful I am that you stuck up for me when speaking with Regis . ”
56869	56876	56877	56877	She	86	“ It was no big deal . ”
56923	56934	56935	56935	she	86	“ It was a big deal to me , JP , ”
56938	56990	56935	56935	she	86	“ I know the last thing you probably wanted was to play the middle man between me and Regis , but I heard what you said to him and it truly meant a lot to me . I ’m not sure you know how important it was that you did it . ”
56991	57002	57015	57015	her	86	“ Seriously , Kelsey , it was no big deal . ”
57003	57012	57013	57013	She	86	“ No , you need to hear this . ”
57045	57085	57028	57028	I	0	“ You set the tone . Moving forward , hopefully , Regis will know that you honor my ideas . You established this is teamwork and not just a project run by men . I owe you , JP . ”

57252	57266	57267	57267	Quietly	184	“ Okay , well , for what it ’s worth , thank you . ”

59013	59138	59006	59006	I	0	“ And I have an equally great explanation . You see , I went to grab my dinner when I heard this noise . I thought it was a ghost or a murderer , or even a suffering animal , like a squirrel caught in a wall or something like that . You never know in these old buildings . Anyway , I thought I ’d check it out , and then when I got closer , I thought you were being stabbed . It really sounded like a stabbing , not that I listen to stabbing noises , but , you know , the movies prepare you for such sounds , so I came in here , attempting to scare away the stabber . ”

59156	59192	59006	59006	I	0	“ I did n’t say I was being smart about it . I was just trying to be a hero without a plan . I see now that maybe that was n’t the best idea . ”

59246	59267	59268	59268	I	0	“ Well , I do n’t know . Maybe you were in the middle of coming when I came in . ”

59902	59909	59933	59933	I	0	“ What ’s so fucking funny ? ”
59910	59916	59933	59933	I	0	“ You said man time . ”
59917	59926	59933	59933	I	0	“ So ? What do you call it ? ”
59927	59932	59933	59933	I	0	“ Not man time . ”
60030	60054	60055	60055	He	1292	“ I ’m sorry I interrupted your man time . Next time , can you attempt to not sound like a suffering animal ? ”
60063	60086	60055	60055	He	1292	“ I ’m never going to be able to come again without worrying what I sound like . Thank you for that . ”
60087	60092	60093	60093	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . ”
60099	60106	60093	60093	I	0	“ I think we needed this . ”
60107	60116	60117	60117	he	1292	“ You walking in on me jacking off ? ”
60122	60141	60117	60117	he	1292	“ No , not that per se , just a moment of levity to break up the tension . ”
60142	60166	60167	60167	I	0	“ Trust me , babe , the tension is still there since you did n’t let me come . Probably worse than ever . ”
60170	60189	60167	60167	I	0	“ Well , then , let me let you get back to your . . . man time . ”
60199	60209	60167	60167	I	0	“ Try not to be so loud this time . ”
60210	60230	60167	60167	I	0	“ Yeah , trust me , I ’ll be putting a goddamn sock in my mouth from now on . ”
60231	60237	60238	60238	We	1294	“ Whatever gets you off . ”
60257	60266	60267	60267	I	0	“ How was the rest of your night ? ”
60323	60327	60336	60336	he	87	“ man time . ”
60392	60399	60400	60400	JP	87	“ The rest of my night ? ”
60414	60417	60400	60400	JP	87	“ Explosive . ”
60429	60438	60439	60439	He	87	“ Well , that ’s good to know . ”
60455	60462	60447	60447	he	87	“ Is it good to know ? ”
60463	60487	60439	60439	He	87	“ Sure , everyone deserves . . . relief . I interrupted the process , so I ’m glad you got to finish . ”
60488	60499	60439	60439	He	87	“ Seems like an odd thing to say to someone . ”
60500	60509	60510	60510	I	0	“ Yeah , I was just thinking that . ”
60529	60556	60510	60510	I	0	“ I honestly was n’t sure what I was going to say to you this morning . That was the best I could come up with . ”
60557	60562	60439	60439	He	87	“ It was weak . ”
60563	60582	60439	60439	He	87	“ I know . Maybe this is why I ’m still single , because I have weak repartee . ”
60583	60591	60510	60510	I	0	“ Nah , that ’s not it . ”
60592	60607	60608	60608	He	87	“ Oh ? Do you have a theory about why I ’m still single ? ”
60616	60621	60608	60608	He	87	“ Trying too hard . ”
60622	60630	60510	60510	I	0	“ How am I trying too hard ? ”
60631	60674	60675	60675	I	0	“ Because you ’re always looking for the next date . Why not sit back and wait for something to happen ? You never know , the person you ’re meant to be with might be right in front of your face . ”
60680	60703	60675	60675	I	0	“ I ’ve tried the waiting game . Nothing has happened . Maybe I should start walking around neighborhoods like Lottie did . ”
60704	60708	60510	60510	I	0	“ Could help . ”
60720	60732	60709	60709	He	87	“ Maybe if you stop looking , it ’ll find you . ”
60739	60756	60734	60734	he	87	“ Plus , you ’re hot . It ’s not like you do n’t arouse interest . ”
60757	60772	60675	60675	I	0	“ I have none , JP . Edwin was the best I could do . ”
60773	60779	60780	60780	He	87	“ Edwin was a tool . ”
60788	60803	60780	60780	He	87	“ There has to be something you ’re more interested in than finding love . ”
60804	60820	60821	60821	He	87	“ Well , I do have this podcast , but it ’s focused around love . ”
60824	60830	60821	60821	He	87	“ What ’s it called ? ”
60831	60847	60780	60780	He	87	“ Meant to Be . I interview couples on how they met and found love . ”
60853	60892	60850	60850	I	0	“ I guess I just love love . I enjoy origin stories , meet - cutes , and the different ways people find each other . It ’s fascinating to me . I also like taking aquatic classes . ”
60893	60897	60898	60898	he	87	“ Aquatic classes ? ”
60901	60915	60898	60898	he	87	“ Tell me more about that . Like , aerobics in the water ? ”
60919	60965	60916	60916	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’m easily the youngest in the class , but that does n’t bother me . I just like working out in the water and the music they play is old - school love songs . So , it works for me . ”
60966	60975	60850	60850	I	0	“ Do you wear a one - piece ? ”
60976	60980	60983	60983	his	87	“ Of course . ”
60986	60991	60983	60983	his	87	“ Such a shame . ”
60992	61020	60850	60850	I	0	“ I ’m not about to work out with a bunch of old ladies in a two - piece . I have a respectable one - piece . ”
61021	61024	60850	60850	I	0	“ Color ? ”
61025	61028	60983	60983	his	87	“ Red . ”
61029	61032	61033	61033	He	87	“ Nice . ”
61041	61049	61033	61033	He	87	“ What ’s your plan for today ? ”
61050	61084	61085	61085	He	87	“ I was going to finalize my ideas for the renovations . Maybe go for a walk . I have meetings lined up for tomorrow , but nothing today . What about you ? ”
61102	61125	61085	61085	He	87	“ I have a meeting in about thirty minutes that I have to run to . Want to meet me for lunch ? ”
61126	61133	61134	61134	I	0	“ Oh , uh , sure , ”
61231	61247	61218	61218	He	87	“ I ’ll text you the time and place . See you later , Kelsey . ”
61248	61251	61252	61252	I	0	“ Bye , ”
61284	61297	61298	61298	I	0	“ Pickle - flavored chips ? I do n’t know about that , ”
61329	61340	61313	61313	He	87	“ Try one . I promise you ’ll like it . ”
61341	61349	61313	61313	He	87	“ And what if I do n’t ? ”
61350	61357	61313	61313	He	87	“ Then you need new tastebuds . ”
61358	61368	61369	61369	I	0	“ You are n’t always right , you know , ”
61376	61393	61394	61394	He	87	“ Most of the time , I am . And I ’m right about these chips . ”
61463	61469	61470	61470	he	87	“ What do you think ? ”
61491	61498	61485	61485	I	0	“ Eh , they ’re okay . ”
61509	61512	61506	61506	he	87	“ Liar . ”
61524	61539	61514	61514	he	87	“ If they ’re just okay , I guess I ’ll eat them myself . ”
61554	61571	61546	61546	I	0	“ Fine . . . they ’re really freaking good and I want more , please . ”
61595	61601	61602	61602	he	87	“ See , always right , ”
61605	61611	61602	61602	he	87	“ And humble , too . ”
61622	61632	61633	61633	He	87	“ So , what was today ’s meeting about ? ”
61638	61661	61633	61633	He	87	“ Just a meeting with Edison . We went around and looked at some other buildings Huxley wanted me to check out . ”
61662	61666	61602	61602	he	87	“ Anything good ? ”
61667	61676	61602	61602	he	87	“ Not really . Not worth our time . ”
61677	61691	61692	61692	He	87	“ How can you tell if it ’s worth your time or not ? ”
61709	61809	61692	61692	He	87	“ Location is always the first thing . The purpose of the building — will it be worth the time and energy we put into it to make money ? And then , of course , renovations . There was also no character to these buildings . They were just kind of there . We ’ve made plenty of money on generic buildings , you ’ve seen them around LA , and we have a few in New York City now , too . They ’ve done the job , but now we ’re more interested in unique buildings . ”
61810	61814	61602	61602	he	87	“ Passion projects ? ”
61815	61819	61820	61820	he	87	“ Sort of , ”
61823	61867	61820	61820	he	87	“ Huxley really wants to expand , hence why he partnered with you . Sometimes I think nothing will be good enough , that he ’ll constantly keep pressing to be the best , but I ’m not sure what the best is . ”
61868	61877	61602	61602	he	87	“ Meanwhile , your workload is filling up . ”
61878	61881	61882	61882	He	87	“ Exactly . ”
61894	61919	61882	61882	He	87	“ I ’m surprised you met up with me for lunch . I thought you hated me too much to do such a thing . ”
61920	61958	61602	61602	he	87	“ I do n’t hate you . Hell , I thought you hated me . I was surprised that you asked me to lunch . Was n’t sure if it was a ploy to do something else . ”
61959	61963	61964	61964	He	87	“ Like what ? ”
61967	61992	61964	61964	He	87	“ I do n’t know , plant some sort of chip in my bedroom so you knew what I was doing at all times . ”
61993	61996	61997	61997	He	87	“ Jesus . ”
62000	62011	61997	61997	He	87	“ What kind of psychopath do you think I am ? ”
62012	62035	61964	61964	He	87	“ Apparently , a creepy one . I do n’t know . It ’s just nice that you ’re talking to me . ”
62036	62052	61964	61964	He	87	“ I ’ve always talked to you , Kelsey , I just vary the tone . ”
62053	62067	61964	61964	He	87	“ No , you were doing the silent treatment there for a bit . ”
62068	62075	62076	62076	he	87	“ Because you pissed me off , ”
62079	62099	62076	62076	he	87	“ I was being a nice guy that night and you treated me like I was an insensitive asshole . ”
62100	62152	61964	61964	He	87	“ I know , and I ’m sorry . I think I was just thrown off by that entire evening , and I was n’t in the best frame of mind . Can I ask , what were your intentions for that night ? You asked me to dance , why ? ”
62153	62156	62157	62157	He	87	“ Because . ”
62167	62201	62157	62157	He	87	“ I wanted to make sure that you had some fun . Getting run over by an old man was n’t the plan . But at least that brought you a little joy . ”
62202	62242	61964	61964	He	87	“ And then Edwin and Genesis took off . Reminds me of When Harry Met Sally — you know , when they go on a double date and their dates go off with each other . That was us . ”
62243	62265	61964	61964	He	87	“ You lucked out , then . I was much better company than Edwin . Better to look at , too . ”
62266	62274	62157	62157	He	87	“ Ah , there ’s that humility . ”
62275	62296	61964	61964	He	87	“ I ’m humble . I ’m just showing you that I know my worth . Nothing wrong with that . ”
62297	62302	61964	61964	He	87	“ I suppose not . ”
62311	62326	62303	62303	I	0	“ So when we got back to your place , what was your intention ? ”
62327	62363	61964	61964	He	87	“ To kick you to your car and send you on your way . I had a date with some chocolate - covered cherries that night and the hell if I was sharing with you . ”
62364	62373	61964	61964	He	87	“ Stop , no , you did not . ”
62379	62421	62376	62376	his	1302	“ Swear by it . I went back to my house , sat in my empty living room because I did n’t have any furniture at that point , and ate five chocolate - covered cherries while I scrolled through Twitter . ”
62422	62453	61964	61964	He	87	“ I ’m having a hard time believing you . You do n’t seem like the kind of guy who kicks back with a box of chocolate - covered cherries . ”
62454	62460	62461	62461	he	1302	“ Well , I am , ”
62464	62502	62461	62461	he	1302	“ They ’re my kryptonite . I ’ll do anything for them and I have a pantry stocked with boxes . Queen Anne ’s , to be precise , because I know that was your next question . ”
62503	62508	61964	61964	He	87	“ You ’re serious ? ”
62509	62520	62461	62461	he	1302	“ Yes . Do n’t believe me ? Text Huxley . ”
62521	62532	62461	62461	he	1302	“ I ’m not going to bother him with that . ”
62533	62539	62540	62540	He	1302	“ Fine , I will . ”
62650	62654	62644	62644	JP	87	“ Told you . ”
62655	62671	62641	62641	I	0	“ Wow . . . that ’s something I never would ’ve guessed about you . ”
62672	62722	62641	62641	I	0	“ Sometimes you have to get to know someone first , Kelsey , before you start trying to put them in a lane in your mind . There ’s a lot you do n’t know about me . Stick around . I ’m sure you ’ll find out more . ”
62723	62746	62751	62751	he	87	“ Yes , I probably will . Just like I found out you do n’t mind masturbating while other people are home . ”
62754	62757	62751	62751	he	87	“ Precisely . ”
62761	62769	62770	62770	Lottie	89	“ What are you up to tonight ? ”
62837	62908	62821	62821	I	0	“ Nothing special . Spent dinner on my own again , second night in a row . JP had a meeting with someone , so I just ordered some cauliflower mac and cheese and called it a night . I ’m planning to read a book in the living room because the skyline at night is so beautiful . I want to soak it in as much as I can . ”
62909	62940	62945	62945	her	1305	“ Sounds . . . riveting . Here ’s an idea — when he gets home , why do n’t you try to walk in on his man time again ? ”
62997	63007	62965	62965	her	1305	“ I ’m never going near that room again . ”
63008	63057	62965	62965	her	1305	“ Come on , after that nipple poking , you ca n’t tell me you ’re not interested in seeing what it ’s like to be kissed by JP . Now is the time . You guys are alone , together , might as well test it out . ”
63058	63085	62965	62965	her	1305	“ Have you hit yourself on the head ? That is n’t what we ’re here for and there ’s no way I ’m going there . ”
63086	63133	62965	62965	her	1305	“ Are you saying you do n’t want him ? Because I do n’t believe that . The Cane brothers are another breed , and it ’s clear there ’s chemistry between you and JP . Find out how hot it could be between you guys . ”
63134	63217	62965	62965	her	1305	“ JP does n’t want me in that way . There was nothing sexual about the nipple poking . If there was the slightest bit of sexiness to that , he would ’ve attempted something when I was sitting on his chest . And , also , sure , I think he ’s hot , but I do n’t want to go there with him . I ’m not looking for a one - night stand . I ’m looking for love . ”
63218	63236	62965	62965	her	1305	“ If he ’s anything like Huxley , you wo n’t want it to be one night . ”
63237	63293	62965	62965	her	1305	“ He ’ll want one night . You know he does n’t do relationships and I do n’t even know why we ’re talking about this , as nothing is happening between us . That whole ordeal in his room was an accident . I have no intention of furthering any sort of physical touching . ”
63294	63310	62965	62965	her	1305	“ Okay , but tell me this — how did it feel poking his nipple ? ”
63371	63416	63366	63366	JP	87	“ It was simple . It ’s not like some magical spark erupted between us . It was brief and awkward and we did n’t talk about it after . I ’m telling you , nothing is going on , so just drop it . ”
63417	63420	63421	63421	she	89	“ Ugh , ”
63424	63432	63421	63421	she	89	“ Why are you ruining my dreams ? ”
63433	63444	63366	63366	JP	87	“ Your dreams ? What on earth do you mean ? ”
63445	63455	63366	63366	JP	87	“ Brother - brother , sister - sister couples . ”
63456	63470	63421	63421	she	89	“ I feel like you did n’t say that in the right order . ”
63471	63478	63479	63479	she	89	“ You know what I mean , ”
63482	63497	63479	63479	she	89	“ It would be so cool if , as sisters , we dated brothers . ”
63498	63523	63421	63421	she	89	“ You ’re not just dating Huxley , you ’re marrying him . Which , by the way , how was the floral meeting ? ”
63524	63527	63528	63528	she	89	“ Boring , ”
63531	63637	63528	63528	she	89	“ Huxley insists on the best for our wedding and I keep telling him it ’s not necessary . He told me today he wants to fly in some Italian designer to make my dress . I told him he was nuts and that I could just go to some boutique here in LA . You should ’ve seen the disgusted look on his face . As if the thought of having to shop for my own dress is so far beneath him . The thing is , Kelse , I just want to be married , I do n’t care about all the fanfare . ”
63638	63647	63421	63421	she	89	“ But it matters to Huxley , right ? ”
63648	63651	63652	63652	she	1308	“ Yes , ”
63655	63683	63652	63652	she	1308	“ Which means I should just go along with it . You know , he was never this flashy when we first started our whole relationship farce . ”
63684	63737	63421	63421	she	89	“ Uh , I beg to differ . Do you not remember the designer clothes and expensive lingerie he forced you to wear ? People did n’t even see your lingerie , and yet , Huxley insisted you wear what he chose , and nothing cost less than one hundred dollars apiece . ”
63738	63759	63421	63421	she	89	“ Ah , I guess you ’re right . Which reminds me , how are you liking those nighttime rompers ? ”
63760	63787	63421	63421	she	89	“ Oh my God , Lottie . I love them so much . They ’re so comfortable . I brought them with me to sleep in . ”
63788	63806	63421	63421	she	89	“ Wait . . . that ’s what you took to sleep in while you ’re there ? ”
63807	63812	63813	63813	She	1309	“ Yeah , why ? ”
63816	63833	63813	63813	She	1309	“ Okay , sure , Kelsey , nothing is going to happen between you and JP . ”
63834	63879	63421	63421	she	89	“ I brought a robe to go over it . Listen , I ’m not going to sacrifice my comfort because it may be considered indecent . I do n’t plan on walking around in them . I ’ll always have a robe on . ”
63880	63928	63421	63421	she	89	“ If you say so . But let me tell you this , you have that date with Derek in a couple of days . If you ’re in any way involved with JP , please do n’t hurt Derek ’s feelings . Ellie would kill me . ”
63929	63963	63813	63813	She	1309	“ You know I would n’t do that . I ’m actually excited about the date . I brought a few dress options for that night . You can help me pick one . ”
63964	63986	63421	63421	she	89	“ Okay , good . Oh , hey , Huxley ’s giving me bedroom eyes , so I should probably go . ”
63987	64003	63421	63421	she	89	“ Shocking — you two are going to have sex , what else is new ? ”
64004	64009	63813	63813	She	1309	“ You sound jealous . ”
64015	64024	64025	64025	I	0	“ Have fun , sis . Good night . ”
64130	64136	64137	64137	I	0	“ Jesus HELL ON EARTH ! ”
64144	64147	64148	64148	I	0	“ JP , ”
64152	64167	64148	64148	I	0	“ What the hell are you doing , standing in the dark like that ? ”
64177	64183	64184	64184	His	1315	“ Just grabbing some water . ”
64197	64203	64184	64184	His	1315	“ What are you doing ? ”
64204	64225	64226	64226	I	0	“ I was going to read out here and enjoy the skyline . God , when did you get home ? ”
64242	64257	64234	64234	I	0	“ About ten minutes ago . Did n’t feel like saying hi to you . ”
64258	64280	64184	64184	His	1315	“ Well , are n’t you kind ? You were just going to wait around in the dark to scare me ? ”
64281	64324	64234	64234	I	0	“ How was I supposed to know you were going to read in here ? Seems kind of weird to me if you plan on reading a book while enjoying the skyline because you ca n’t do both at the same time . ”
64325	64331	64332	64332	I	0	“ Yes , I can , ”
64341	64364	64332	64332	I	0	“ Every so often I can look up from my book and enjoy the scenery , and then go back to reading . ”
64365	64381	64382	64382	I	0	“ The book ca n’t be that good if you ’re looking up from it . ”
64393	64410	64382	64382	I	0	“ Is there a reason you ’re sticking around and not retreating back to your space ? ”
64411	64416	64332	64332	I	0	“ Question for you . ”
64417	64427	64428	64428	I	0	“ Oh , please delight me with your inquiry , ”
64455	64482	64449	64449	he	1316	“ Friday night , I ’ve been invited to the mayor ’s house for a ball . Was n’t sure if you wanted to tag along . ”
64541	64545	64546	64546	I	0	“ Friday night ? ”
64551	64571	64546	64546	I	0	“ That ’s when I have that date with Derek . I do n’t want to stand him up . ”
64580	64592	64577	64577	he	87	“ Date , huh ? Still going out with that guy ? ”
64593	64628	64577	64577	he	87	“ Well , seeing as though I ’m currently in the dating ring , I would say yes . But if this is a work thing , I can see if Derek can reschedule . ”
64629	64654	64662	64662	he	87	“ It ’s not . Go on your date . Find love . I ’m sure he ’ll be the man of your dreams . ”
64680	64683	64684	64684	JP	87	“ warming up ”
64691	64705	64673	64673	he	87	“ You do n’t have to be a dick about it , JP . ”
64706	64716	64717	64717	I	0	“ Did n’t think I was being a dick . ”
64723	64729	64717	64717	I	0	“ Your sarcasm is unmistakable . ”
64730	64740	64673	64673	he	87	“ I ’m sorry you see it that way . ”
64741	64759	64673	64673	he	87	“ I do n’t see it that way , JP , that ’s how you ’re acting . ”
64760	64781	64717	64717	I	0	“ What do you want me to do ? Throw a party for you because you finally have a date ? ”
64782	64785	64786	64786	I	0	“ Hey , ”
64792	64801	64786	64786	I	0	“ Do n’t throw that in my face . ”
64802	64809	64810	64810	He	1317	“ Throw what in your face ? ”
64840	64863	64834	64834	I	0	“ The fact that I do n’t get many dates . Using the word finally in your sentence was a low blow . ”
64864	64881	64812	64812	his	1317	“ Jesus Christ , are you going to pick apart every sentence I say to you ? ”
64882	64905	64812	64812	his	1317	“ No , but if you ’re going to be rude to me , then I ’m going to point it out . ”
64906	64920	64834	64834	I	0	“ I ’m not being rude . Christ , stop being so sensitive . ”
64921	64926	64927	64927	I	0	“ Me , sensitive ? ”
64935	65006	64927	64927	I	0	“ How am I being sensitive ? You ’re the one whose mood swings like goddamn Tarzan on a vine . For Christ ’s sake , I ca n’t keep up with you . Just moments ago , we were cool , and now you ’re being mean . Is this because I ca n’t go with you to the ball ? Newsflash , JP , people need some notice . ”
65007	65013	65014	65014	he	1318	“ Do n’t flatter yourself , ”
65022	65029	65014	65014	he	1318	“ Why are you like this ? ”
65030	65034	64927	64927	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
65035	65061	64927	64927	I	0	“ We were having a nice time . We had a great lunch , we were communicating well , and now you ’re dismissing me . ”
65062	65081	64927	64927	I	0	“ How do you want me to act ? Do you want me to gush over your date ? ”
65208	65216	65190	65190	I	0	“ What the hell are you doing ? ”
65246	65253	65226	65226	I	0	“ Uh , Kelsey . . . ”
65254	65266	65226	65226	I	0	“ I ’m not getting up until you change your attitude . ”
65273	65283	65226	65226	I	0	“ Is this another attempt to trap me again ? ”
65284	65345	65226	65226	I	0	“ Yes . And do n’t get any funny ideas . I ’m not trying to do anything . . . sexual , but knowing you , this position is satisfactory to you , therefore , this is where I ’ll sit , on your lap , until you can talk to me without a sarcastic tone in your voice . ”
65346	65352	65353	65353	he	1318	“ Might take a bit , ”
65388	65406	65376	65376	I	0	“ Man , I did n’t know you were a dominatrix . That ’s a hidden gem . ”
65407	65411	65412	65412	I	0	“ Shut up , ”
65415	65423	65412	65412	I	0	“ God , you ’re so annoying . ”
65424	65436	65376	65376	I	0	“ And yet , you choose to be in my company . ”
65437	65462	65376	65376	I	0	“ I choose peace and that means getting you to stop being a dick . So . . . tell me something about you . ”
65463	65466	65467	65467	he	1318	“ What ? ”
65476	65529	65467	65467	he	1318	“ Tell me something , anything . We ’re getting to know each other right now . Call it a company get - to - know - you . Oh , hey , okay . . . how about two truths and a lie . You know , that ice breaker game . ”
65530	65548	65561	65561	His	1318	“ Does it look like I ’m the type of guy who plays that sort of game ? ”
65549	65557	65558	65558	I	0	“ Humor me . . . please , ”
65633	65636	65627	65627	He	1318	“ Fine , ”
65646	65687	65627	65627	He	1318	“ Two truths and a lie . . . okay . How about this ? I once went scuba diving with whales . I think I have the greatest job in the world . And winter is my favorite season . ”
65688	65744	65627	65627	He	1318	“ Well , that ’s easy . Scuba diving with whales seems like a rich - person activity , so that ’s true . You clearly love your job , so . . . winter is n’t your favorite season , which makes sense since you ’re a born - and - raised California boy . ”
65745	65750	65751	65751	he	1318	“ Errrrr , wrong , ”
65759	65770	65751	65751	he	1318	“ Really ? You never went scuba diving with whales ? ”
65771	65808	65809	65809	I	0	“ No , I swam with whales . In Mo’orea , an island of French Polynesia to be exact . It ’s a sanctuary for humpback whales . One of the best vacations of my life . ”
65815	65828	65809	65809	I	0	“ JP , if you ’re not going to take this seriously — ”
65829	65839	65840	65840	I	0	“ Who says I ’m not taking it seriously ? ”
65862	65871	65849	65849	his	1318	“ I told two truths and a lie . ”
65879	65891	65876	65876	I	0	“ So , you ’re telling me you hate your job ? ”
65892	65898	65899	65899	he	1318	“ Yes . I am , ”
65907	65921	65899	65899	he	1318	“ Wait . . . are you being serious ? You hate it ? ”
65922	65930	65876	65876	I	0	“ Yes . I hate my job . ”
65931	65986	65987	65987	I	0	“ But . . . you make it seem like you enjoy it . I ’m confused . You have your own company with your brothers , you get to work with them day in and day out , you have your own schedule , and you get to stay in places like this . ”
65993	66004	65987	65987	I	0	“ What can you possibly hate about all of that ? ”
66012	66022	66007	66007	his	1323	“ Yeah , did n’t think you ’d understand . ”
66041	66045	66046	66046	I	0	“ Hold on . ”
66054	66064	66046	66046	I	0	“ You ’re being honest , you hate it ? ”
66065	66076	66051	66051	his	1323	“ How many times do I have to say it ? ”
66077	66082	66083	66083	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
66086	66110	66083	66083	I	0	“ I ’m just confused . You ’ve been very convincing that you enjoy what you do . Why do you hate it ? ”
66111	66126	66051	66051	his	1323	“ Let me ask you this — what do you like about your job ? ”
66127	66225	66051	66051	his	1323	“ Well , besides the obvious of having my own business and the complexities of experiencing the growth and downfalls , I love it because I feel like I ’m helping make this world a better place to live . There are studies that go into detail about the therapeutic process of organizing spaces and how it can act as a calming technique for people who have to live and work in that space . And on top of that , I ’m spreading the word about sustainability , which alone makes this job all worth it . ”
66226	66236	66237	66237	I	0	“ You feel like you ’re making a difference . ”
66240	66329	66237	66237	I	0	“ That ’s where I fall flat . I do n’t think I ’m doing anything in this damn life of mine that ’s worth something . Sure , I have money , more money than any of us or any lineage to follow could spend in a lifetime , and it just keeps coming in , multiplying . There ’s no stopping it because there ’s no stopping my brothers . They want to take over the world and I ’m only really along for the ride . ”
66330	66390	66051	66051	his	1323	“ But you ’re not money - greedy humans . You donate a lot of money to organizations throughout LA . You ’re leaders in real estate when it comes to best business practices — minus Huxley ’s ‘ fake fiancée ’ thing with Lottie — but you ’re honest men , trustworthy . You ’re not hurting anyone . ”
66391	66407	66051	66051	his	1323	“ Yeah , but we ’re not helping anyone . We ’re only helping ourselves . ”
66408	66414	66415	66415	I	0	“ That ’s not true , ”
66418	66489	66415	66415	I	0	“ Lottie specifically asked Huxley why he kept working when they first started seeing each other . He said he had all the money he could possibly need , but he continued because if he did n’t work , if he did n’t expand , then the people who relied on him could n’t afford a life for their families . He keeps working so his employees can keep working . ”
66490	66578	66620	66620	his	1325	“ And Huxley can say that , because it ’s true , but my job does n’t warrant the accolades Huxley and Breaker receive . I ’m just the public relations face . Hell , some days , I have nothing to do . The only reason why you work with me is because I ’m the one who could handle the additional workload , which is barely anything since you pretty much do everything on your own . I get a paycheck , but for nothing . ”
66579	66595	66620	66620	his	1325	“ Some people would be pleased with that , you know , especially your paycheck . ”
66596	66616	66617	66617	I	0	“ Yes , but when you have to live up to your brothers ’ reputation , it ’s brutal . ”
66625	66631	66617	66617	I	0	“ I can understand that . ”
66674	66691	66692	66692	He	1325	“ Then , can I ask you , what is it that you want to do ? ”
66695	66703	66692	66692	He	1325	“ Still trying to figure that out . ”
66704	66711	66714	66714	his	1325	“ Would you leave the company ? ”
66717	66763	66714	66714	his	1325	“ No , my brothers depend on me . They ’re very private people and trust practically no one . If I left , they ’d have to take on my job responsibilities . They would n’t hire someone outside of the family for that . ”
66764	66778	66779	66779	He	1325	“ That does n’t make sense , though . You ’re not happy . ”
66782	66791	66779	66779	He	1325	“ Maybe that ’s my life . Unhappy . ”
66792	66800	66714	66714	his	1325	“ That ’s not fair to you . ”
66801	66812	66779	66779	He	1325	“ Well , Kelsey , sometimes life is n’t fair . ”
66818	66855	66815	66816	the pessimist	1326	“ You do n’t have to put yourself in purgatory in order to help your brothers . I ’m sure if you spoke to them , they ’d want to know that you ’re not happy . ”
66856	66861	66862	66862	he	1325	“ You ’d think , ”
66903	66915	66893	66893	I	0	“ I still need to do two truths and a lie . ”
66916	66919	66920	66920	He	1325	“ Right . ”
66974	66984	66958	66958	he	1325	“ What are your two truths and a lie ? ”
66993	66998	66990	66990	I	0	“ Since you asked . ”
67005	67161	66999	66999	He	1325	“ Let ’s see . I like to collect magnets . I ’ve always said I ’d collect a magnet from every new place I visit , but I have n’t been many places , so it ’s a sad collection . I have a plant in my apartment that I ’ve had since college . His name is Boris and we have a mutual understanding that I ’ll always water him and he ’ll never die on me . And I plan the color of my underwear for each day of the working week . Weekends are a free - for - all . And before you ask , Monday is red . Tuesday is pink . Wednesday is black . Thursday is green , because I once heard green is for Thursdays , because that ’s when you make the money , when you should work the hardest . And Friday is white . ”
67177	67206	67207	67207	I	0	“ All three were in - depth . Frankly , it ’s disturbing how easily you rattled those off . Makes me believe you ’re some secret operative . ”
67212	67218	67207	67207	I	0	“ Better watch your back . ”
67226	67248	67219	67219	He	1329	“ The first one seems like something you ’d do , but you only have like . . . five magnets . ”
67249	67263	67207	67207	I	0	“ Four , to be exact . But it ’s a collection nonetheless . ”
67264	67315	67316	67316	My	0	“ And a plant named Boris feels on - brand for you , but so does the underwear , but my guess is you messed up the days of the week so instead of Friday being white , it ’s actually black , because that ’s a typical date night . ”
67327	67336	67321	67321	I	0	“ How the hell did you guess that ? ”
67337	67393	67394	67394	I	0	“ You might be able to think quick on your feet , but I can smell bullshit from a mile away . You ’re a romantic on a dating journey and I ’m assuming , given your innocence , wearing black on Friday , date night , is daring for you . Just makes sense . ”
67405	67420	67394	67394	I	0	“ Okay , so what ’s the order of the rest of my underwear ? ”
67433	67541	67429	67429	his	1329	“ Monday is white , to start the week off on a fresh note . Tuesday is pink because you seem to be the type of girl who would have a lot of pink underwear so it fits in on a Tuesday . Wednesday is red for hump day . Thursday . . . well , that ’s the wild card . I kind of believe the whole green money - making thing , so I ’m going to say that ’s right . And then black on Friday . The weekends are probably when you wear fun underwear . Like some pink thong with a heart . ”
67552	67561	67549	67549	he	1329	“ I ’m right , are n’t I ? ”
67576	67582	67569	67569	he	1329	“ Unfortunately , you are . ”
67611	67626	67605	67605	he	1329	“ But I do want you to know that I ’m not that innocent . ”
67627	67630	67631	67631	He	1329	“ Sure . ”
67650	67655	67631	67631	He	1329	“ I ’m not . ”
67661	67675	67676	67676	He	1329	“ I ’ve done plenty of non - innocent things in my lifetime . ”
67679	67683	67676	67676	He	1329	“ Like what ? ”
67713	67725	67726	67726	He	1329	“ Face it , you ’re as innocent as they come . ”
67736	67739	67733	67733	I	0	“ Vibrator . ”
67762	67775	67753	67753	I	0	“ I have a vibrator . There , that ’s not innocent . ”
67776	67782	67753	67753	I	0	“ What kind of vibrator ? ”
67783	67794	67795	67795	I	0	“ You know . . . the kind that vibrates , ”
67801	67806	67795	67795	I	0	“ It ’s pink . ”
67807	67814	67815	67815	He	1329	“ Of course it ’s pink . ”
67818	67851	67815	67815	He	1329	“ Not innocent , Kelsey . Just about every woman has a vibrator . And from my guess , you probably use it every Wednesday to go along with your red underwear . ”
67871	67916	67862	67862	He	1329	“ Face it , you ’re as innocent as they come . If your day - of - the - week underwear does n’t say it , then your inability to tell me — in detail — the kind of vibrator you have is . ”
67917	67922	67923	67923	I	0	“ It ’s pink . ”
67929	67938	67923	67923	I	0	“ What else do you want from me ? ”
67961	68002	67945	67945	his	1329	“ Pulse rate , settings , girth , length , and attachments . I want to know if you were too scared to even look at vibrators with a clit stimulator , so you just went with a common stick . ”
68008	68019	67945	67945	his	1329	“ That ’s what you got , was n’t it ? ”
68020	68050	68051	68051	He	1329	“ What does it matter the kind of . . . er , pulse rate it has ? I masturbate , so , therefore , I ’m not innocent . ”
68065	68070	68051	68051	He	1329	“ Okay , Kelsey . ”
68071	68074	68075	68075	I	0	“ Hey , ”
68134	68142	68143	68143	I	0	“ Would you call this outfit innocent ? ”
68146	68152	68153	68153	he	1329	“ A robe is innocent , ”
68160	68168	68153	68153	he	1329	“ I ’m not wearing a robe . ”
68306	68315	68316	68316	he	1329	“ Why the hell are you wearing that ? ”
68320	68345	68316	68316	he	1329	“ This is what I wear at night . It ’s just one of the many pieces of lingerie I have in my dresser . ”
68346	68355	68356	68356	he	1329	“ Well , I suggest you go change , ”
68364	68368	68369	68369	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”

68388	68395	68374	68374	him	1329	“ It ’s indecent , Kelsey . ”
68470	68490	68491	68491	I	0	“ Is there some sort of acceptance of a double standard in this penthouse that I ’m unaware of ? ”
68494	68508	68491	68491	I	0	“ Because I ’m pretty sure I ’m more covered up than you . ”
68599	68607	68608	68608	I	0	“ Wh - what are you doing ? ”
68617	68635	68608	68608	I	0	“ You ’re tempting me , Kelsey , and I do n’t take too kindly to it . ”
68636	68665	68666	68666	He	1329	“ How am I tempting you ? I ’m just . . . I ’m showing you I ’m not the innocent peasant girl you think I am . ”
68787	68804	68808	68808	his	1329	“ You could ’ve chosen any pajamas to bring with you , and you bring this . ”
68821	68858	68808	68808	his	1329	“ So , unless you plan on bedding someone while you ’re here that I do n’t know about , you brought this specifically knowing you ’d be spending nights in the same penthouse as me . ”
68859	68874	68875	68875	His	1329	“ This has nothing to do with you and everything to do with comfort . ”
68900	68924	68886	68886	his	1329	“ So , you ’re telling me , if you were sharing a penthouse with Huxley instead , you ’d have worn this ? ”
68925	68928	68929	68929	I	0	“ No , ”
69023	69038	69015	69015	I	0	“ I mean . . . I would n’t wear this around him because — ”
69039	69046	69047	69047	JP	87	“ Because he ’s not single . ”
69104	69115	69116	69116	He	87	“ You wore this to tempt me , admit it . ”
69155	69174	69146	69146	his	87	“ It ’s why you keep coming after me to talk , because you want this , Kelsey . ”
69175	69180	69181	69181	I	0	“ I do n’t , ”
69206	69213	69214	69214	he	87	“ You ’re a fucking liar , ”
69340	69385	69331	69331	he	87	“ You ’re glistening , Kelsey . Your breath is uneven , your body is yearning for more , and I know for a fucking fact , that if I spread your legs , I ’d find a wet cunt , begging for me . ”
69455	69463	69447	69447	he	87	“ Tell me it ’s the truth . ”
69500	69512	69513	69513	he	87	“ Is that how you ’re going to be , Kelsey ? ”
69524	69533	69513	69513	he	87	“ You ’re not going to be truthful ? ”
69581	69587	69588	69588	He	87	“ Your nipple is hard . ”
69624	69627	69628	69628	he	87	“ Mmmm , ”
69634	69642	69628	69628	he	87	“ That ’s what I fucking thought . ”

69699	69703	69704	69704	he	87	“ Big mistake , ”
69720	69723	69724	69724	I	0	“ Fuck , ”

69773	69789	69768	69768	I	0	“ That ’s right , make room . Tell me — how wet are you ? ”
69798	69802	69795	69795	I	0	“ Really wet . ”
69929	69939	69920	69920	he	87	“ I told you , you were fucking lying . ”
69997	70013	70014	70014	He	87	“ Lie to me again , and you wo n’t like what happens next time . ”
71347	71350	71351	71351	I	0	“ Morning , ”
71375	71379	71380	71380	she	89	“ Good morning , ”
71399	71403	71404	71404	I	0	“ Let me , ”
71416	71424	71425	71425	she	89	“ Oh . . . thank you , ”

71598	71602	71603	71603	she	2758	“ My breakfast ? ”
71608	71614	71603	71603	she	2758	“ Did you order in ? ”
71615	71618	71619	71619	I	0	“ No . ”
71626	71648	71619	71619	I	0	“ Woke up early , could n’t sleep , so I cooked your breakfast that you like , beans and all . ”
71649	71660	71677	71677	I	0	“ Why . . . why would you do that ? ”
71721	71736	71708	71708	you	1372	“ You know , Kelsey , a simple thank you would be just fine . ”
71840	71847	71837	71837	I	0	“ I was bored this morning . ”
71877	71883	71869	71869	she	1375	“ Thank you for breakfast . ”
71884	71887	71888	71888	I	0	“ Sure , ”
71927	71933	71924	71924	I	0	“ Can I help you ? ”
71934	71971	71924	71924	I	0	“ I ’m just confused , is all . It seemed like you were mad at me last night and now you made me breakfast . . . I do n’t know how to process this . ”
71972	71982	71905	71905	her	1375	“ I was n’t mad at you last night . ”
71983	71988	71924	71924	I	0	“ You threatened me . ”
71989	71993	71994	71994	I	0	“ Jesus Christ . ”
71999	72014	71994	71994	I	0	“ That was n’t a threat , more like . . . a warning . ”
72015	72038	71924	71924	I	0	“ So , you warned me last night . And if that ’s the case , then maybe I should warn you . ”
72044	72056	71924	71924	I	0	“ Okay , what do you need to warn me about ? ”
72057	72073	71924	71924	I	0	“ Well . . . you should n’t be walking around without a shirt on . ”
72074	72079	72080	72080	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
72084	72097	72098	72098	She	1377	“ And what ’s going to happen to me if I do ? ”
72105	72113	72098	72098	She	1377	“ You do n’t want to know . ”
72114	72126	71924	71924	I	0	“ I do , actually . I really want to know . ”
72127	72130	72131	72131	She	1377	“ Fine . ”
72134	72148	72131	72131	She	1377	“ If you walk around without a shirt on , I will too . ”
72155	72163	72164	72164	I	0	“ And you consider that a punishment ? ”
72176	72209	72164	72164	I	0	“ My shirt is off now , so please , Kelsey , go ahead and punish me . Strip out of that starchy blouse of yours . Show me the good stuff . ”
72210	72213	72214	72214	She	1377	“ Ugh . ”
72219	72257	72214	72214	She	1377	“ Why are you so insufferable ? I ’m just trying to make things comfortable for us , but you ’re either angry , teasing me , or . . . well . . . you know . ”
72258	72269	72270	72270	She	1377	“ I do n’t know . Please finish that sentence . ”
72277	72289	72270	72270	She	1377	“ You ’re . . . well , touching me intimately . ”
72290	72319	72214	72214	She	1377	“ That was barely touching you last night . And correct me if I ’m wrong , but you seemed to like it . . . a lot . ”
72320	72326	72270	72270	She	1377	“ I was faking it . ”
72336	72354	72270	72270	She	1377	“ Babe , I tasted you off your finger last night . You ca n’t fake that . ”
72355	72362	72363	72363	She	1377	“ Do n’t call me babe . ”
72369	72376	72363	72363	She	1377	“ Can we just be friends ? ”
72377	72387	72214	72214	She	1377	“ What did I tell you about workplace friendships ? ”
72388	72434	72435	72435	I	0	“ That was some load of bullshit . I ’m friends with Huxley and Breaker . So do n’t tell me I ca n’t be friends with you . You just do n’t want to be friend - zoned because you want in my pants . ”
72440	72448	72435	72435	I	0	“ I do want in your pants . ”
72464	72509	72461	72461	she	1377	“ Well , that ’s not an option for you . So , why do n’t we just put that behind us and move on ? We can be friends . It ’s simple . We just need to do friendly type of things . ”
72515	72525	72512	72512	I	0	“ Okay , what are friendly type of things ? ”
72526	72549	72435	72435	I	0	“ I ca n’t think of anything off the top of my head , but — oh , we could go sightseeing . ”
72550	72563	72449	72449	Her	1377	“ Why does that sound not the least bit interesting to me ? ”
72564	72627	72512	72512	I	0	“ It ’s totally a friend thing to do . You ’ve been here before , clearly , so why do n’t we do that after I ’m done with my last meeting ? You could show me around . I can take pictures in all the obvious places . It could be fun and we could get to know each other . ”
72628	72637	72435	72435	I	0	“ It does n’t sound fun to me . ”
72638	72641	72642	72642	she	1378	“ JP ! ”
72648	72669	72642	72642	she	1378	“ Stop being difficult , and for the love of God , just go sightseeing with me . Good God . ”
72675	72706	72672	72672	I	0	“ Okay , no need to get all riled up . We can go sightseeing , but I ’ll tell you this — I’ll be a bastard the whole time . ”
72707	72722	72723	72723	She	1378	“ It would n’t be an evening out with you if you were n’t . ”
72731	72762	72723	72723	She	1378	“ My last meeting is at two today . After I get back , I ’ll change , and then we can hit the town . How does that sound ? ”
72763	72768	72769	72769	I	0	“ Like a nightmare . ”
72777	72782	72769	72769	I	0	“ Ca n’t wait . ”
72811	72814	72800	72800	I	0	“ Kelsey ? ”
72815	72818	72819	72819	she	1378	“ Yes ? ”
72828	72862	72819	72819	she	1378	“ Just so you know , you can act like we ’re friends all you want , but know this . . . I can still taste your sweet cunt on my tongue . ”
72918	72925	72929	72929	she	89	“ This place is so cute , ”
72941	72947	72948	72948	I	0	“ It ’s hemorrhaging tourists , ”
72951	72961	72929	72929	she	89	“ Which is exactly what we wanted , right ? ”
72962	72978	72979	72979	I	0	“ What you wanted . This is not my idea of fun in San Francisco . ”
72990	73003	72979	72979	I	0	“ Ooo , they have a carousel . Let ’s ride it . ”
73004	73023	73024	73024	She	89	“ You ’re out of your goddamn mind if you think I ’m going to ride a carousel . ”
73037	73043	73024	73024	She	89	“ It ’ll be fun . ”
73044	73058	73059	73059	She	89	“ Kelsey , I ’m serious , I ’m not riding that thing . ”
73084	73110	73071	73071	she	89	“ Loosen up . This is what friends do — silly things like this . You can take a boomerang of me on a horse . ”
73111	73119	73073	73073	her	89	“ What the hell is a boomerang ? ”
73120	73124	73125	73125	she	89	“ On Instagram , ”
73135	73140	73125	73125	she	89	“ That clarifies nothing . ”
73141	73155	73125	73125	she	89	“ It ’s what we did in front of the Full House houses . ”
73270	73286	73287	73287	she	89	“ How many times have you been up here ? San Francisco , that is , ”
73290	73297	73298	73298	I	0	“ More than I can count , ”
73301	73310	73298	73298	I	0	“ Have you ever been to Pier 39 ? ”
73311	73322	73364	73364	She	89	“ A few times . Took a date here once . ”
73323	73329	73330	73330	Kelsey	89	“ Oooo , a date , ”
73338	73351	73330	73330	Kelsey	89	“ Tell me more . I did n’t think Jack Parker dated . ”
73352	73357	73364	73364	She	89	“ Not my name . ”
73358	73363	73364	73364	She	89	“ A solid guess . ”
73367	73396	73364	73364	She	89	“ It was a few years ago . We went out for fun and ended the night in my bed . Worth the inconvenience of coming down here . ”
73397	73420	73364	73364	She	89	“ Let me guess — since I wo n’t be ending up in your bed — this is n’t worth the inconvenience ? ”
73421	73432	73433	73433	I	0	“ There ’s always time for that to turn around , ”
73437	73441	73433	73433	I	0	“ Not happening . ”
73447	73464	73442	73442	She	89	“ But nice try . So , tell me , have you ever had a girlfriend ? ”
73465	73468	73469	73469	I	0	“ Yes , ”
73472	73477	73478	73478	she	89	“ Care to elaborate ? ”
73490	73494	73478	73478	she	89	“ Not really . ”
73495	73517	73442	73442	She	89	“ Oh , is it one of those stories where she was the one and only girl to break your heart ? ”
73529	73543	73518	73518	We	1391	“ No , actually . I was the one who broke her heart . ”
73544	73548	73549	73549	she	89	“ You were ? ”
73552	73560	73549	73549	she	89	“ Was she in love with you ? ”
73561	73564	73565	73565	I	0	“ Yes , ”
73568	73574	73565	73565	I	0	“ And you were n’t ? ”
73580	73630	73575	73575	I	0	“ I was n’t . And I did n’t think it was fair to keep dating her if I knew the feelings were n’t going to grow in that direction , so I broke up with her . She threw a milkshake in my face and then stormed away . ”
73631	73649	73650	73650	I	0	“ Oh my God , she threw a milkshake in your face ? What flavor was it ? ”
73653	73659	73650	73650	I	0	“ Why does that matter ? ”
73660	73675	73575	73575	I	0	“ Ca n’t be sure , but you know , details make a story . ”
73676	73701	73575	73575	I	0	“ I believe it was vanilla , another reason why I knew we were n’t supposed to be together . Vanilla milkshakes are boring . ”
73702	73734	73650	73650	I	0	“ Hey , no , they ’re not . They ’re the original . You ’re not going to get another flavor without them . Do n’t knock the vanilla milkshake . ”
73735	73742	73575	73575	I	0	“ Is that what you order ? ”
73743	73748	73749	73749	She	1393	“ Of course not . ”
73757	73765	73749	73749	She	1393	“ Strawberry is obviously what I get . ”
73800	73807	73790	73790	Kelsey	89	“ What ’s your milkshake order ? ”
73808	73811	73754	73754	her	1393	“ Chocolate . ”
73812	73823	73824	73824	I	0	“ Could ’ve guessed that . You ’re so predictable . ”
73829	73856	73824	73824	I	0	“ And strawberry milkshake was n’t predictable ? All you have to do is say hi , and everyone knows you ’re a strawberry milkshake girl . ”
73857	73896	73754	73754	her	1393	“ Nothing wrong with that . So , this girl threw a milkshake in your face when you broke up with her . Was there anything that happened after that , or was the milkshake where it ended ? ”
73907	73923	73897	73897	I	0	“ We had breakup sex that night , but after that , it was over . ”
73924	73933	73824	73824	I	0	“ Oh , Jean - Pierre . . . ”
73934	73939	73940	73940	She	89	“ Not my name . ”
73945	73965	73940	73940	She	89	“ Still , sex after you broke up with her ? Kind of skeezy , do n’t you think ? ”
73966	73975	73976	73976	I	0	“ Never said I made the best choices , ”
73980	73988	73976	73976	I	0	“ How long ago was this relationship ? ”
73989	74036	73940	73940	She	89	“ Eh , like two , three years ago . I think she ’s engaged now . At least that ’s what I surmised when she ‘ accidentally ’ texted me a photo of her engagement ring . She said it was meant for someone else . ”
74037	74042	74043	74043	Kelsey	89	“ Oh , surrrrrre , ”
74055	74085	74043	74043	Kelsey	89	“ That ’s what they all say . She sent you that picture on purpose to try to make you jealous . Were you ? Jealous , that is ? ”
74086	74112	73940	73940	She	89	“ Not in the slightest . Honestly , it ’s shitty to say , but I ’d kind of forgotten about her until that text . ”
74113	74125	74043	74043	Kelsey	89	“ And since then , you ’ve been a lone wolf ? ”
74126	74134	74043	74043	Kelsey	89	“ Yeah , nothing wrong with that . ”
74135	74141	74142	74142	she	89	“ Not saying there is , ”
74187	74211	74230	74231	the attendant	1397	“ Just fascinating . I , on the other hand , am single because . . . well , apparently I ’m unlovable . ”
74212	74224	74225	74225	I	0	“ You know for damn sure that ’s not the truth , ”
74240	74259	74235	74235	he	1397	“ What do they always say . . . you just have n’t found the right person yet ? ”
74260	74268	74269	74269	she	89	“ But do you truly believe that ? ”
74321	74324	74325	74325	I	0	“ Sure , ”
74347	74354	74336	74336	I	0	“ That ’s not very convincing . ”
74355	74465	74466	74466	I	0	“ I do n’t know what you want me to say . You ’re hot , so there ’s instant attraction . In the work environment , you ’re cool , professional , and obviously know sustainability issues front to back . Having spent more time with you recently , I ’ve learned that you always want to get your way , in a . . . pestering , control - freak way , and I ’m seeing more she - devil behavior that I ’m not sure many people know is there . But there ’s got to be someone out there who likes that kind of thing . ”
74490	74493	74494	74494	she	1401	“ Wow , ”
74499	74510	74494	74494	she	1401	“ What a lovely picture you ’ve painted of me . ”
74535	74546	74547	74547	I	0	“ What do you plan on doing with those pictures ? ”
74557	74563	74547	74547	I	0	“ Blackmail , of course . ”
74577	74584	74564	74564	She	1401	“ I ’d expect nothing less . ”
74588	74595	74564	74564	She	1401	“ JP , put it on . ”
74596	74649	74674	74674	She	1401	“ If you think I ’m wearing that , you ’ve lost your goddamn mind . I ’ve already ridden the carousel , taken those stupid boomerang things on a trolley , and pretended to hold Alcatraz in my hand . I draw the line at wearing a goddamn bib at dinner . ”
74650	74657	74564	74564	She	1401	“ You ’re being a snob . ”
74658	74669	74564	74564	She	1401	“ Because I do n’t want to wear a bib ? ”
74670	74673	74674	74674	She	1401	“ Precisely . ”
74680	74688	74674	74674	She	1401	“ It ’s part of the experience . ”
74744	74755	74737	74737	I	0	“ I ’m good with missing out on the experience . ”
74756	74769	74709	74709	she	1401	“ Joo - Joo Poo - Poo , put on the bib . ”
74770	74787	74709	74709	she	1401	“ Is Joo - Joo Poo - Poo supposed to be a guess of my name ? ”
74788	74798	74737	74737	I	0	“ Yes . . . is that not correct ? ”
74799	74804	74709	74709	she	1401	“ Not even close . ”
74805	74821	74709	74709	she	1401	“ Damn , I would ’ve absolutely snorted all over this table if it was . ”
74822	74825	74737	74737	I	0	“ Attractive . ”
74826	74831	74832	74833	our waitress	1405	“ Here we are , ”
74871	74874	74737	74737	I	0	“ Enjoy . ”
74875	74885	74886	74886	Kelsey	89	“ Wow , that ’s a lot of crab , ”
74889	74899	74886	74886	Kelsey	89	“ But I ’ve worked up quite the appetite . ”
74959	74964	74965	74965	she	89	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
74971	74983	74965	74965	she	89	“ It ’s startling how quickly you snapped off that leg . ”
74984	75000	74965	74965	she	89	“ Let that be a reminder to you , JP . Do n’t cross me . ”
75001	75004	75005	75005	I	0	“ Clearly . ”
75087	75094	75095	75095	I	0	“ Just give it to me , ”
75130	75139	75114	75114	I	0	“ Oh , do n’t you look adorable ? ”
75140	75152	75153	75153	She	89	“ If you take a picture , I ’m going to — ”
75170	75176	75177	75177	She	89	“ Oops , too late . ”
75186	75203	75177	75177	She	89	“ Ooo , this might be my favorite of the night . It ’s a keeper . ”
75204	75215	75177	75177	She	89	“ Teasing your boss is n’t in your best interest . ”
75216	75276	75281	75281	she	1407	“ You ’re technically not my boss as you just oversee things . If we want to get down to the nitty - gritty , my boss is Huxley , as you ’ve pointed out to me , and I ’m sure he ’ll give me a raise once he sees the ‘ data ’ I ’ve collected tonight . ”
75285	75292	75281	75281	she	1407	“ I ’ll still report insubordination . ”
75293	75299	75300	75300	She	1407	“ Good luck with that . ”
75310	75356	75300	75300	She	1407	“ Now , will you please tell me why this place is n’t suitable for you ? Clearly , the crab is delicious , the views are amazing , the attire . . . top - notch . How could this not appeal to you ? ”
75357	75362	75363	75363	She	1407	“ It ’s gimmicky . ”
75368	75474	75363	75363	She	1407	“ Just what I thought , you ’re a snob . Do n’t hate on a place that does it right for the people who come to visit . This is fulfilling dreams for me right now . Eating crab by the pier , boats just outside the window in the bay , the old subway tile from floor to ceiling , and the simple dining room tables that are n’t quite nautical but offer nautical vibes . This is everything . So , excuse me if I find this completely fulfilling . Now if only the grump sitting across from me would lighten up . ”
75475	75484	75538	75538	she	1408	“ This just is n’t my ideal night . ”
75485	75503	75538	75538	she	1408	“ Uh - huh . You say that as if you have an ideal night in mind . ”
75504	75508	75538	75538	she	1408	“ I do . ”
75541	75549	75538	75538	she	1408	“ Oh , please , do tell . ”
75550	75559	75560	75560	I	0	“ I do n’t have to tell you , ”
75563	75571	75560	75560	I	0	“ I ’m going to show you . ”
75572	75576	75577	75577	I	0	“ Show me ? ”
75580	75605	75606	75606	She	1408	“ Tomorrow night , when you ’re done with your meetings . I ’m showing you what my ideal night in San Francisco is . ”
75622	75642	75619	75619	she	1408	“ Wait , so this friendship we ’re developing , it is n’t just a one - night thing ? ”
75643	75661	75662	75662	She	1408	“ This is n’t a friendship , it ’s a . . . short - term companionship . ”
75680	75723	75662	75662	She	1408	“ Wow , no wonder you ’re in charge of the media for Cane Enterprises . You sure know how to spin things . Okay , I ’ll bite . This short - term companionship , it ’s going to continue tomorrow ? ”
75724	75727	75728	75728	I	0	“ Yes , ”
75749	75766	75804	75804	she	1408	“ And I ’ll show you exactly what a night out on the town is like . ”
75767	75777	75804	75804	she	1408	“ Bet it wo n’t be better than tonight . ”
75778	75784	75804	75804	she	1408	“ Guaranteed it will be . ”
75785	75793	75794	75794	She	1408	“ Listen , Julian Prince . . . ”
75819	75841	75808	75808	I	0	“ I gathered damning evidence of you on a carousel and wearing a bib . Nothing is going to beat this . ”
75842	75849	75850	75850	I	0	“ That ’s what you think , ”
75861	75873	75874	75874	Kelsey	89	“ Okay . . . admit it , this is good , ”
76008	76012	76013	76013	She	89	“ Come on . ”
76026	76033	76013	76013	She	89	“ Yes , this is good . ”
76034	76041	76042	76042	She	89	“ Ha , I knew it . ”
76053	76061	76042	76042	She	89	“ I knew I ’d get you . ”
76062	76072	76013	76013	She	89	“ You did n’t get me , Ghirardelli did . ”
76217	76232	76243	76243	her	89	“ Oh my God , look over there , that couple is making out . ”
76233	76236	76237	76237	I	0	“ What ? ”
76246	76262	76240	76240	She	89	“ Right there , in the corner . What do you think — first date ? ”
76263	76273	76276	76276	her	89	“ Do you do that on a first date ? ”
76278	76297	76276	76276	her	89	“ Because from what I recall of our first and only date , you were pricklier than that . ”
76298	76321	76322	76322	I	0	“ Because I was expecting to meet the man of my dreams , and instead it was the man of my nightmares . ”
76327	76334	76322	76322	I	0	“ You wound me , Kelsey . ”
76341	76360	76335	76335	She	89	“ But look at us now , living out a short - term companionship . Miracles do happen . ”
76361	76380	76276	76276	her	89	“ Do n’t let it get to your head . We ’re barely a short - term companionship . ”
76381	76425	76335	76335	She	89	“ I do n’t know , you agreed to a second outing with me , so it seems like we ’re committed to each other . If that does n’t smell of short - term companionship , I do n’t know what does . ”
76426	76435	76335	76335	She	89	“ Christ , you ’re incessantly annoying tonight . ”
76436	76455	76335	76335	She	89	“ Just a dash of what I have to deal with when I ’m hanging out with you . ”
76506	76548	76499	76499	I	0	“ So , you never answered the question . Is that what you do on a first date ? Make out in the corner of a chocolate store so romance voyeurs like yourself can watch the sideshow of lip - locking ? ”
76549	76620	76679	76679	Her	89	“ Maybe when I was twenty - one I would ’ve been more likely to make out in a restaurant , but now that I ’m a respectable lady in her mid - twenties , I have standards . I expect a good meal , great conversation , and then , if I ’ve been dazzled by the end of the night , I ’ll lean in for a kiss . ”
76621	76634	76723	76723	She	89	“ Dazzled , huh ? What does it take to dazzle you ? ”
76635	76639	76640	76640	she	89	“ Taking notes ? ”
76647	76678	76640	76640	she	89	“ Yes , on how to do the opposite , you know , because if I ’m not annoying you , then what am I actually doing with my life ? ”
76688	76706	76685	76685	I	0	“ Well , if that ’s the case , I ’ll be keeping my dazzling to myself . ”
76717	76722	76707	76707	I	0	“ Just tell me . ”
76733	76887	76723	76723	She	89	“ Well , first of all , he ca n’t be full of himself . He needs to have a level head , and be a good listener , but also not be afraid to talk about himself . Family is important to me , so I want to know that he ’s close to his family . Hmm , what else ? Oh , a self - deprecating story is always good , because then I know he does n’t take himself too seriously . I also like little touches here and there , but nothing too over the top . I like to know that he ’s interested without crowding me . And of course , interesting questions , a conversation that just flows . Also , I ’m super into a good smile , kind eyes , and a man who pulls a chair out for me . A gentleman . ”
76892	76953	76888	76888	I	0	“ There was a column I used to read , called ‘ The Modern Gentleman . ’ He always said to open the door for your girl , but as she walks through that door , be sure to run your hand along her ass so she knows who she belongs to . Is that what you ’re looking for ? ”
76968	76980	76981	76981	I	0	“ I mean , I would n’t be mad about it . ”
76984	77014	76981	76981	I	0	“ I ’m going to take that as a yes . You know , that ’s a pretty high standard you ’re requiring a man to live up to . ”
77015	77023	77024	77024	she	1422	“ Should I feel guilty about that ? ”
77042	77072	77037	77037	I	0	“ No , I do n’t think so . Why settle when you know what you want ? Although , do n’t you think you were settling with Edwin ? ”
77073	77091	76981	76981	I	0	“ Edwin was clearly a momentary lapse of judgment . Frankly , I blame you for Edwin . ”
77092	77095	77096	77096	I	0	“ Me ? ”
77102	77121	77096	77096	I	0	“ Why do you blame me ? I did n’t force you to go out with the dweeb . ”
77122	77137	76981	76981	I	0	“ He was n’t a dweeb , he was just . . . dweebish . ”
77138	77157	76981	76981	I	0	“ If that makes you feel better , sure . But not sure why you ’re blaming me . ”
77158	77184	76981	76981	I	0	“ Because , that dinner we had at the blind date restaurant was atrocious . It made me think I had to lower my standards . ”
77185	77192	77193	77193	I	0	“ It was n’t that bad , ”
77196	77238	77193	77193	I	0	“ You were n’t the one who was there to meet someone . You were there to fulfill a bet . I was honestly excited . It might have seemed entertaining to you , but it was more disheartening to me . ”
77265	77270	77271	77271	I	0	“ Sorry , Kelsey , ”
77280	77325	77271	77271	I	0	“ I was an idiotic , prideful man that night . You wounded my pride when I first showed up , and I did n’t shake it off . I tried to bring you down with me . I should n’t have done that . ”
77339	77350	77336	77336	she	1423	“ Wow , uh . . . thanks , JP . ”
77361	77411	77351	77351	She	1423	“ Carousel , pictures , bibs . . . and an apology . Dare I say , this might be one of my favorite nights ever ? A vast improvement from the blind date restaurant . This whole ‘ short - term companionship ’ thing is actually rather enjoyable . ”
77412	77422	77355	77355	her	1423	“ Glad I could make it up to you . ”
77423	77432	77351	77351	She	1423	“ You did . . . Josiah Phoenix . ”
77433	77436	77437	77437	Her	1423	“ Close . ”
77443	77446	77437	77437	Her	1423	“ Really ? ”
77450	77453	77447	77447	I	0	“ No . ”
77454	77457	77458	77458	She	1423	“ Ugh . ”
77462	77468	77458	77458	She	1423	“ That was just mean . ”
77469	77475	77476	77476	I	0	“ I found it entertaining . ”
77497	77506	77507	77507	Kelsey	89	“ Can you roll me to my room ? ”
77524	77535	77510	77510	she	89	“ I do n’t think I can move another inch . ”
77560	77570	77536	77536	She	89	“ Wow , this is a sight to see . ”
77604	77612	77601	77601	she	89	“ Did you happen to hear that ? ”
77613	77634	77589	77589	She	89	“ Babe , the doorman thirty stories down heard that . It rattled the very floor I ’m standing on . ”
77635	77641	77601	77601	she	89	“ Do n’t be dramatic . ”
77642	77657	77601	77601	she	89	“ I think San Francisco will be reporting an earthquake on the Richter scale . ”
77658	77662	77589	77589	She	89	“ Stop it . ”
77663	77672	77673	77673	She	89	“ I actually feel nauseated from the aftershocks . ”
77693	77699	77683	77683	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
77700	77726	77589	77589	She	89	“ Pulling you to your room . . . wait . . . nothing going to come out of the bottom end , is there ? ”
77727	77739	77683	77683	I	0	“ Eww , do you really think I would do that ? ”
77740	77795	77796	77796	She	89	“ Well , honestly , I would n’t be able to tell you , because the girl I once knew as the tight - lipped perfectionist just unbuttoned her jeans in front of me and let out a monstrous belch , so . . . I ca n’t be sure what might happen next . ”
77810	77830	77796	77796	She	89	“ This is why I ’ll never find anyone to love me . I ’m a closet gross person . ”
77831	77845	77846	77846	She	89	“ No , you ’re not . . . you ’re just normal . ”
77854	77872	77846	77846	She	89	“ You ’re just saying that so I do n’t actually fart while you ’re pulling me . ”
77873	77894	77846	77846	She	89	“ I ’m really not . It ’s nice to see that you ’re not always so stuck - up . ”
77895	77904	77846	77846	She	89	“ Stuck - up ? That ’s preposterous . ”
77905	77919	77920	77920	I	0	“ Only someone who ’s stuck - up would use the term preposterous , ”
77966	77974	77954	77954	She	89	“ What on earth are you doing ? ”
77975	77982	77983	77983	I	0	“ Tossing you on your bed , ”
78026	78030	78031	78031	I	0	“ Jesus Christ , ”
78037	78045	78031	78031	I	0	“ You were supposed to let go . ”
78046	78092	78132	78132	her	89	“ I just ate a whole crab , half a plate of fries , half a sundae , and had to unbutton my pants in front of you when we got home . What on earth makes you think I want to be tossed around ? ”
78093	78106	78031	78031	I	0	“ So , this , me pressing into your stomach is better ? ”
78107	78113	78031	78031	I	0	“ Could be better positioning . ”
78114	78118	78119	78119	I	0	“ Let go , ”
78122	78129	78119	78119	I	0	“ Oh , right , yes . ”
78144	78172	78139	78139	I	0	“ Now , would it be too much to ask of our short - term companionship to have you strip me down and put my pajamas on ? ”
78178	78200	78201	78201	She	89	“ Babe , if I ’m stripping you down , I ’m sure as fuck not putting anything back on you . ”
78206	78218	78201	78201	She	89	“ Oh yeah ? You ’d want a piece of this ? ”
78219	78227	78201	78201	She	89	“ Oddly , I find it intriguing . ”
78228	78237	78238	78238	I	0	“ Standards , JP . . . standards . ”
78241	78246	78247	78247	I	0	“ I have none . ”
78254	78267	78247	78247	I	0	“ Are you going to be able to manage on your own ? ”
78274	78297	78268	78268	She	89	“ I believe so . It might take me a hot second to gather myself but , yes , I ’ll persevere . ”
78298	78308	78346	78346	she	89	“ Okay , then . . . good night . ”
78309	78318	78319	78319	I	0	“ Good night . . . Jordan Preston . ”
78329	78335	78319	78319	I	0	“ It ’s Jonah Peter . ”
78349	78357	78346	78346	she	89	“ Good night . . . Jonah . ”
78358	78364	78346	78346	she	89	“ Good night , Kelse . ”
79051	79054	79034	79034	You	89	“ oh God ”
79117	79123	79124	79124	JP	87	“ Are you almost ready ? ”
79131	79134	79135	79135	I	0	“ Yes , ”
79138	79147	79135	79135	I	0	“ Sheesh , give a girl a second . ”
79148	79155	79107	79107	Kelsey	89	“ You ’ve had multiple seconds . ”
79156	79165	79135	79135	I	0	“ I got home like a minute ago . ”
79166	79184	79135	79135	I	0	“ Try ten minutes . You just had to change . What are you doing in there ? ”
79185	79190	79191	79191	I	0	“ Putting on deodorant . ”
79213	79223	79224	79224	I	0	“ God , do you want me to smell ? ”
79343	79346	79347	79347	he	355	“ What ? ”
79355	79375	79347	79347	he	355	“ Uh . . . sorry , just do n’t think I ’ve ever seen you this casual before . ”
79388	79405	79376	79376	He	355	“ Did you expect me to dress up for you ? This is n’t a date . ”
79414	79419	79420	79420	I	0	“ I know that , ”
79432	79456	79420	79420	I	0	“ But pardon me if I ’m a little stunned to see you in a hat . Did n’t know you owned one . ”
79457	79469	79423	79423	him	355	“ I ’m pretty sure every male owns a baseball hat . ”
79470	79479	79420	79420	I	0	“ Well , it looks odd on you . ”
79501	79511	79512	79512	he	355	“ Well , jeans look fucking weird on you , ”
79516	79519	79512	79512	he	355	“ Really ? ”
79532	79554	79527	79527	He	355	“ No , but see how it ’s unkind to say people look weird ? A compliment would ’ve been good . ”

If that ’s the case , I tease my friends , and therefore , I ’ll say you look weird in a hat because I ’m so used to Mr. Businessman . But if you truly need to know , the backwards hat suits you . ”

They actually have a recipe book you can buy . But it still wo n’t taste the same . This cake takes years to refine , and that , you need to appreciate . ”

It was slow at first . A random bird here , a seagull there . I flailed a bit , trying to scare them away , but then they started talking . . . chirping to each other . Saying , ‘ Hey , there ’s an unsuspecting idiot over there at the end of the pier — ’ ”

Beaks were knocking together , and there was nothing I could do other than toss my to - go box of food as far from me as I could and hold on for dear life until they left me a shaking shell of a man on the boardwalk . ”

88868	88935	88865	88865	he	1564	“ It was mine for naively thinking I could eat a meal in a place where tourists have no concept of not feeding the wildlife , because the more you feed them , the more aggressive they become . A lesson was learned , and whenever I come here now , it ’s usually just me and my thoughts . Well . . . now you . ”

Since he ’s the oldest , I feel like he ’s always carried the burden of making sure we ’re all taken care of . When we decided to invest money into a business of our own , he sat us down and said he was setting us up for the future , which he did . Financially , Breaker and I are both set . We do n’t have to worry . ”
89696	89704	89705	89705	I	0	“ But when it comes to happiness ? ”
89708	89714	89705	89705	I	0	“ Still figuring that out . ”
89721	89741	89715	89715	He	1574	“ I ’m sure you have some early morning meetings . I should get you back to the penthouse . ”
89742	89748	89753	89753	him	1574	“ Unfortunately , I do . ”
89786	89802	89767	89767	he	1574	“ Thank you , again , for tonight . I had a lot of fun . ”
89803	89809	89810	89810	he	1574	“ I did , too , ”
89813	89855	89810	89810	he	1574	“ I was kind of afraid when we were told to come up here that it would be awkward and weird . It was at first , but these last two days have been really great . Just what I needed . ”
89856	89862	89863	89863	he	1574	“ Yeah , about that , ”
89907	89912	89913	89913	I	0	“ Must be important , ”
89916	89931	89913	89913	I	0	“ Go ahead , answer it . I ’ll meet you in the car . ”
89932	89936	89937	89937	he	1574	“ You sure ? ”
89940	89947	89937	89937	he	1574	“ Yeah . It ’s fine . ”
89962	89970	89956	89956	he	1574	“ Keep it . I ’m fine . ”
89984	89987	89988	89988	he	1574	“ What ? ”
90006	90008	90012	90012	his	1574	“ Fuck ”
90087	90091	90082	90082	I	0	“ Everything okay ? ”
90092	90095	90096	90096	he	1574	“ Yeah , ”
90102	90114	90096	90096	he	1574	“ Just some bullshit stuff I have to deal with tomorrow . ”
90115	90122	90123	90123	I	0	“ Anything I can help with ? ”
90136	90145	90126	90126	He	1574	“ Nah , nothing you can deal with . ”
90985	90988	90989	90989	I	0	“ Morning , ”
91005	91016	91002	91002	She	89	“ Good morning . Did you make me breakfast again ? ”
91017	91021	91002	91002	She	89	“ I did . ”
91027	91036	91002	91002	She	89	“ How do you feel about breakfast sandwiches ? ”
91037	91045	91046	91046	She	89	“ I feel very positive about them . ”
91068	91077	91046	91046	She	89	“ Are you feeling better from last night ? ”
91078	91081	91082	91082	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
91100	91147	91082	91082	I	0	“ Sorry about the way I reacted . Huxley told me some bullshit that I have to deal with tonight and it put me in a bad mood . I should n’t have responded that way , especially since we were having such a good time . ”
91148	91168	91227	91227	her	1604	“ What ’s tonight — oh , you have to go to that mayor ’s ball thing , right ? ”
91169	91188	91082	91082	I	0	“ Yeah , I do . Fancy event with a bunch of people I have to talk to . ”
91195	91202	91189	91189	I	0	“ But , I was thinking — ”
91203	91212	91227	91227	her	1604	“ Do you know what you ’re wearing ? ”
91216	91224	91213	91213	she	1604	“ A ball gown , I hope . ”
91235	91255	91227	91227	her	1604	“ Yeah , it ’s being dry - cleaned as we speak . I pick it up at noon . ”
91256	91270	91271	91271	she	1604	“ You must show me pictures when I get back from my date , ”
91445	91456	91457	91457	I	0	“ Still , uh , still going on that date ? ”
91491	91504	91475	91475	she	1604	“ Yes , and I ’m nervous . What should I wear ? ”
91570	91578	91564	91564	I	0	“ What you ’re wearing is fine . ”
91727	91737	91738	91738	Kelsey	89	“ I ca n’t wear this on a date , ”
91750	91756	91738	91738	Kelsey	89	“ It ’s business attire . ”
91757	91768	91769	91769	I	0	“ Are n’t dates like business at first , though ? ”
91808	91871	91780	91780	I	0	“ Uh , they are n’t for me . Not sure how you treat a date , but they ’re supposed to be fun and exciting , a separate part of your day , something to look forward to . If I wear this outfit , I ’ll just be reminded of work . Plus , I like wearing dresses on dates . ”
91910	91922	91923	91923	she	1604	“ I do n’t want to be too fancy , though , ”
91997	92007	92036	92037	a douche	1619	“ Get this , you ’re going to laugh . ”
92010	92025	92036	92037	a douche	1619	“ He ’s taking me to the Crab House . Can you believe that ? ”
92133	92167	92095	92095	He	2800	“ But unlike when you and I had dinner there , I ca n’t possibly order a whole crab , snap the leg off in front of him , and wear a bib . ”
92168	92174	92175	92175	I	0	“ Why the hell not ? ”
92178	92248	92175	92175	I	0	“ Because , with you , it did n’t matter . I was n’t trying to impress you . I do n’t want Derek thinking I ’m some psycho who likes mutilating sea creatures . I mean , I ’m not , but let ’s be honest , I was sort of putting on a show when it came to snapping those legs . I wanted to startle you . ”
92263	92273	92274	92274	she	1624	“ I think I might just get a salad , ”
92277	92282	92283	92283	I	0	“ That ’s bullshit , ”
92289	92292	92293	92293	she	1624	“ What ? ”
92327	92335	92293	92293	she	1624	“ I said , that ’s bullshit . ”
92365	92372	92360	92360	she	1624	“ Wait , are you mad ? ”
92388	92403	92360	92360	she	1624	“ Just do n’t try to be someone you ’re not , is all . ”
92412	92417	92418	92418	she	1624	“ I ’m not , ”
92424	92435	92418	92418	she	1624	“ You are if you do n’t get a crab . ”
92436	92445	92497	92497	she	1624	“ I like salads too , you know ? ”
92446	92463	92497	92497	she	1624	“ Then why did n’t you get a salad when we went to the Crab House ? ”
92464	92473	92474	92474	she	1624	“ Because I ’m more comfortable around you , ”
92500	92534	92497	92497	she	1624	“ I do n’t expect you to understand this since you do n’t dare date people . You only test - run them to make sure they ’re good enough for your bed . ”
92549	92557	92558	92558	I	0	“ Is that what you really think ? ”
92561	92570	92558	92558	I	0	“ You ’ve had one girlfriend , JP . ”
92571	92623	92624	92624	I	0	“ Because no one has been interesting enough for me to consider going any further than a few dates . I was just starting to get to know Genesis before the gala , but we had n’t slept together . Has n’t anyone ever told you quality versus quantity , Kelsey ? ”
92655	92668	92647	92647	I	0	“ JP , wait . I did n’t mean to insult you . ”
92669	92676	92677	92677	I	0	“ It ’s fine , Kelsey , ”
92681	92687	92677	92677	I	0	“ Have a good date . ”
92969	92974	92975	92975	Huxley	90	“ Are you there ? ”
92998	93005	93006	93006	I	0	“ Yes , I ’m here , ”
93013	93020	93006	93006	I	0	“ Why do you sound short ? ”
93021	93066	92991	92991	his	0	“ Oh , I do n’t know , maybe because I ’m in a goddamn tuxedo at this stupid Mayor ’s Ball , where I have to not only speak with Regis about his stupid bullshit , but also suck up to the mayor . ”
93067	93077	92991	92991	his	0	“ This is to expand the business , JP . ”
93078	93131	93006	93006	I	0	“ Do n’t you think we ’ve expanded enough ? Jesus Christ , Huxley , we can barely keep up with everything we have going on . You ’re getting married , and you ’re going to start a family . Do you really think starting more projects is a smart idea ? ”
93132	93151	92991	92991	his	0	“ You thought it was a smart idea months ago , so why am I hearing differently now ? ”
93152	93208	92991	92991	his	0	“ I actually did n’t say anything in that meeting , if you ’d paid attention . You rattled on about new opportunities , Breaker nodded with dollar signs in his eyes , while I sat there , wondering why the fuck we were going to start something new when our plates were already full . ”
93209	93223	93006	93006	I	0	“ Then you should ’ve spoken up . We ’re not mind readers . ”
93224	93230	93231	93231	I	0	“ I have spoken up , ”
93261	93308	93259	93259	Huxley	90	“ I ’ve said shit to you before , but you never listen . You and Breaker never fucking listen . So here I am , sitting in my goddamn car , waiting to go into this ball to help accomplish your dreams , not mine . ”
93309	93324	93006	93006	I	0	“ For the company , JP . Not for me . For the company . ”
93325	93342	93259	93259	Huxley	90	“ The company is you , and we ’re just your minions along for the ride . ”
93343	93360	93259	93259	Huxley	90	“ Where the fuck is all of this coming from ? Did something happen up there ? ”
93361	93396	93397	93397	He	1631	“ Of course , that ’s what you ’d assume , that something would happen that would put me in this mood , right ? It ca n’t possibly be how I actually feel . ”
93407	93419	93397	93397	He	1631	“ I think you and I need to have a meeting . ”
93420	93428	93429	93429	I	0	“ Yeah , no fucking thank you , ”
93514	93524	93525	93526	my driver	1634	“ Are you ready to get out , sir ? ”
93570	93572	93567	93568	the mayor	3168	“ our ”
93999	94011	94012	94012	Regis	180	“ JP , did n’t think I ’d see you tonight , ”
94034	94043	94023	94023	He	180	“ Was n’t sure you attended these events . ”
94069	94083	94084	94085	The bartender	1661	“ When the mood strikes me , I ’ll put on a tuxedo . ”
94121	94127	94128	94128	I	0	“ Heard you called Huxley . ”
94152	94156	94157	94157	Regis	180	“ I did , ”
94168	94179	94157	94157	Regis	180	“ I felt like the call needed to be made . ”
94188	94191	94157	94157	Regis	180	“ Why ? ”
94192	94215	94165	94165	his	180	“ I felt like you were preoccupied with other things , not seeing the damage her ideas could have to the building . ”
94216	94255	94270	94270	he	180	“ And what exactly was I preoccupied with ? Because , as I recall , I was present for that entire first meeting , and all I saw from you was misogynistic behavior that will not be tolerated . ”
94273	94301	94270	94270	he	180	“ You were preoccupied with her . I saw the way you stared at her mouth , got lost in her words , sided with her ideas . ”
94380	94468	94368	94368	I	0	“ You must be mistaken , Regis , because she ’s a colleague , nothing more , and unlike some other men , I ’m sure someone like you , I have the ability to keep my mind focused on the project and not the woman attempting to use her voice . What you might have seen as affection or one - sidedness toward Miss Gardner was merely the ability to listen attentively to an intelligent woman , a woman who ’s a partner in our business . ”
94475	94496	94469	94469	I	0	“ Did you hear that ? A partner . Do you know what being a partner with Cane Enterprises entails ? ”
94514	94602	94603	94603	He	1666	“ Being a partner means we ’ve vetted you . We ’ve made sure that not only are you credible , but we have confidence in putting our name on your brand . Miss Gardner and her business , Sustainably Organized , is a partner . She ’s fully trusted by all three of the Cane brothers . We ’ve invested in her company to help our company , so any problem you might have with her is a problem with us . Do you understand that ? ”
94606	94632	94633	94633	He	1666	“ And when working in the future with Miss Gardner , you will not only listen to her suggestions , but you will respect them . ”
94637	94657	94633	94633	He	1666	“ Because if you do n’t respect Miss Gardner , then your days working with Cane Enterprises are numbered . ”
94670	94678	94667	94667	I	0	“ Have a good evening , Regis . ”
94733	94748	94729	94729	he	1666	“ Mr. Cane , the mayor would like to have a conversation with you . ”
94796	94804	94770	94771	The guard	1670	“ He ’ll be with you shortly . ”
94962	94975	94946	94946	Eugene	216	“ JP Cane , I ’m so glad you could make it . ”
94997	95017	94988	94988	I	0	“ Mr. Mayor , thank you for the invite . It ’s always nice to catch up with everyone . ”
95029	95038	95039	95039	He	216	“ You can drop that Mr. Mayor crap . ”
95086	95091	95080	95080	I	0	“ I ’m good . ”
95092	95104	95105	95105	He	216	“ Not sure I ’ve ever seen you smoke , Cane . ”
95125	95130	95131	95131	I	0	“ Not my thing , ”
95134	95147	95131	95131	I	0	“ Never was able to get into it . Cough too much . ”
95160	95188	95148	95148	Eugene	216	“ Takes some stiff lungs to handle a good cigar . Although , I see you can handle a solid drink . What ’s that ? Brandy ? ”
95189	95192	95193	95193	I	0	“ Scotch , ”
95196	95205	95193	95193	I	0	“ My drink of choice as of late . ”
95206	95213	95148	95148	Eugene	216	“ Ah , how ’s business ? ”
95214	95217	95218	95218	I	0	“ Good , ”
95221	95227	95218	95218	I	0	“ Growing , as always . ”
95228	95233	95234	95234	He	216	“ I see that . ”
95245	95254	95234	95234	He	216	“ May I suggest why you ’re here ? ”
95255	95258	95259	95259	I	0	“ Please , ”
95262	95274	95259	95259	I	0	“ Word on the street is you acquired the Angelica Building . ”
95275	95280	95281	95281	I	0	“ That ’s correct , ”
95291	95323	95281	95281	I	0	“ That was a very sought - after building , so I was surprised that a company based in Los Angeles won , given how many local companies were after it . ”
95324	95329	95330	95330	He	216	“ We lucked out . ”
95335	95341	95332	95332	his	216	“ What are your plans ? ”
95342	95349	95350	95350	He	216	“ Currently , those are classified . ”
95405	95464	95391	95391	he	216	“ You do realize that I ’m not an idiot , JP . Now that you ’ve acquired the Angelica , I know you ’re going to want more once you ’re done with that building , and I also know that you have n’t talked with any of the historical societies in town . Am I correct ? ”
95474	95507	95465	95465	I	0	“ Cane Enterprises is known for their beautiful buildings around the country , but you ’re also known for your commercial buildings that are stripped of all character and maximized for profit . ”
95508	95522	95384	95384	he	216	“ Smart business choice . I think it ’s done well for us . ”
95523	95542	95650	95651	the people	765	“ It might have done well for you in other parts of the country , but not here . ”
95543	95638	95639	95639	I	0	“ And that ’s why we do n’t have any plans of stripping down the Angelica . We ’re quite aware of the importance of the Angelica to this city . We also understand preserving history is vital , as well . Rest assured , when we ’re done with the renovations , not only will the Angelica be brought back to her original beauty , but she ’ll be fully functioning , more environmentally friendly , and will help the people of this city — if I have anything to do with it , ”
95665	95670	95671	95671	Eugene	216	“ Well . . . ”
95679	95695	95673	95673	his	216	“ It seems as though I ’m just going to have to wait and see . ”
95696	95735	95736	95736	He	216	“ Correct . But when I say the Angelica is in the right hands , I mean it . Once we ’re done , you ’ll seek out more buildings for us to renovate around your beautiful city . ”
95750	95759	95760	95760	He	216	“ We ’ll see about that , JP . ”
95772	95777	95760	95760	He	216	“ Good seeing you . ”
95778	95787	95788	95788	He	216	“ You too . . . Mr. Mayor . ”

96105	96112	96127	96127	Huxley	90	“ I ’m worried about you . ”

96130	96161	96127	96127	Huxley	90	“ And I ’m worried about you . You sound like you ’re in a dark place . What ’s going on ? Breaker suggested you have feelings for Kelsey . ”
96173	96216	96165	96165	I	0	“ Are we in some fucking gossiping schoolyard I do n’t know about ? Breaker needs to keep his mouth shut , and I swear to God , if you say anything to Lottie , I ’m going to actually murder you . ”
96217	96222	96223	96223	he	1703	“ I would n’t , ”
96226	96232	96223	96223	he	1703	“ But is it true ? ”
96233	96315	96165	96165	I	0	“ I do n’t fucking know , okay ? I do n’t fucking know anything . And it ’s not like it matters anyway . I ’m not her type . I ’m not someone she ’d go for , that ’s evident , because she ’s out with Derek Toney right now and he could n’t be more opposite of me . And where the fuck did he come from , anyway ? Why is he going out with Kelsey ? ”
96316	96322	96323	96323	Huxley	90	“ Lottie set it up , ”
96326	96351	96323	96323	Huxley	90	“ Dude , listen , I ’m going to send the plane tomorrow . I want to have this conversation with you in person . ”
96352	96365	96165	96165	I	0	“ I ’m not going to leave Kelsey up here by herself . ”
96366	96381	96323	96323	Huxley	90	“ You ’ll be back . But we have some business to talk about . ”
96382	96387	96388	96388	I	0	“ Can you not ? ”
96399	96415	96391	96391	I	0	“ Please , for the love of God , do n’t . Not right now . ”
96422	96461	96416	96416	I	0	“ And I ’m not leaving tomorrow . Send a plane all you want , I ’m not getting on it . Actually , I have to go . I ca n’t fucking deal with this right now . ”

There ’s a droop in your shoulders , no joy in your smile . The date did n’t go the way you wanted it . And now , you ’re back at ground zero , attempting to find someone else to take you out . ”

103972	104019	103964	103964	she	1778	“ I . . . I do n’t do those kinds of things , and for some reason , I ca n’t seem to be my normal self around you . I lose my mind and start thinking that it ’s okay to be sexually provocative . ”
104020	104031	104032	104032	I	0	“ It is okay for you to be sexually provocative , ”
104035	104053	104032	104032	I	0	“ But I do n’t want to be . I want so much more than sexual gratification . ”
104058	104081	104054	104054	Her	1778	“ God , I do n’t know why I ’m talking to you about this when it is n’t something you understand . ”
104082	104095	103964	103964	she	1778	“ Because I ’m not the relationship kind of guy , right ? ”
104096	104099	104100	104100	she	1778	“ Right , ”
104107	104123	104100	104100	she	1778	“ Last night was probably a silly game to you and I was a pawn . ”
104124	104134	104135	104135	My	0	“ You were n’t a pawn in my game . ”
104147	104168	104142	104142	She	1778	“ Then what was it ? Because I ca n’t think of a good reason why we ’d do that . ”
104169	104210	104100	104100	she	1778	“ I do n’t know , Kelsey , maybe because there ’s a sexual attraction between us ? Is that too hard to believe ? Maybe we were so inflamed with need that we let our will slip last night . ”
104211	104223	104224	104224	she	1778	“ Well . . . it wo n’t be happening again , ”
104230	104234	104235	104235	I	0	“ Gathered that , ”
104285	104334	104282	104282	she	1778	“ I do n’t do those kinds of things . . . I ca n’t seem to be my normal self around you . I lose my mind and start thinking that it ’s okay to be sexually provocative . I want so much more than sexual gratification . ”
104370	104376	104377	104377	she	1778	“ What are you doing ? ”
104380	104402	104377	104377	she	1778	“ Sitting in front of your iPad so when Huxley calls , he can see me . Is that a problem ? ”
104403	104406	104407	104407	she	1778	“ No , ”
104575	104583	104584	104584	I	0	“ I ’m sorry about last night , ”
104588	104625	104584	104584	I	0	“ I was in a bad place . I ’ll be honest , Kelsey . I think you ’re really hot . I lost control , and I ’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable . ”
104659	104722	104642	104642	I	0	“ No , I ’m sorry . I should n’t have spoken to you like that . I think I freaked out , and rather than acting like a normal human being , I blamed everything on you when I should n’t have . In the moment , when everything was happening , I wanted it . I wanted it so bad . ”
104744	104779	104738	104738	I	0	“ Yeah , I wanted it bad , too . I think there was only one shred of self - control left that held me back from tearing that bustier off and fucking you . ”
104790	104798	104787	104787	she	1784	“ I would ’ve let it happen . ”
104799	104802	104803	104803	I	0	“ Hell , ”
104813	104819	104820	104820	She	1784	“ Do n’t say that . ”
104823	104874	104820	104820	She	1784	“ I was sad last night . You were right about Derek . He did n’t kiss me , and I was feeling really low . I clung to you in all the wrong ways . I should ’ve just talked to you like I ’m talking to you now . ”
104904	104953	104954	104954	She	1784	“ You did n’t have a chance to talk to me . I provoked you right away . In all honesty , I was sad you were n’t at the Mayor ’s Ball with me , and I took it out on you . I should n’t have . ”
104958	104965	104954	104954	She	1784	“ You were sad about that ? ”
104969	105003	104966	104966	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’d had fun the previous two nights and , I do n’t know , I did n’t want to go alone . I forgot about your date , though . ”
105004	105016	105017	105017	I	0	“ You should ’ve said something , I would ’ve rescheduled . ”
105029	105076	105019	105019	you	1784	“ Nah , you were excited about it . I should ’ve acted more respectfully , but that ’s sort of hard for me . I do n’t make the right choices sometimes , and last night it showed . I ’m really sorry , Kelsey . ”
105077	105082	105083	105083	she	1784	“ Do n’t be , ”
105116	105144	105092	105092	I	0	“ I think we both treated each other unfairly . I used you because I was feeling empty after that date , and I never should have . ”
105145	105153	105154	105154	I	0	“ It really did n’t go well ? ”
105164	105170	105159	105159	she	1784	“ I thought it did . ”
105173	105180	105181	105181	She	1784	“ But it ended . . . ”
105192	105211	105181	105181	She	1784	“ God , this is so embarrassing and I ca n’t believe I ’m even considering telling you . ”
105225	105230	105222	105222	I	0	“ No judgment here . ”
105237	105251	105231	105231	She	1784	“ God , he gave me a handshake last night as a goodbye . ”
105252	105256	105257	105257	I	0	“ A handshake ? ”
105275	105351	105352	105352	She	1784	“ Yes , I was mentally preparing for a kiss , followed up by an ‘ I ’ll call you , ’ or ‘ let ’s do this again , ’ maybe even a possible ‘ I ca n’t wait to see you again . ’ But I got a thank you and a handshake , and then I was on my way . It was such a letdown because I thought there was chemistry . ”
105357	105404	105354	105354	her	1784	“ I was so sad when I came home . All I can think about is what ’s wrong with me ? What ’s so horrible about me that I ’d pull a handshake out of a man ? I mean , not even a hug ? ”
105405	105428	105431	105431	her	1784	“ Nothing is wrong with you , Kelsey . Trust me , nothing is fucking wrong with you . You ’re perfect . ”
105435	105440	105431	105431	her	1784	“ I ’m not . ”
105453	105461	105462	105462	I	0	“ Kelsey , you ’re fucking perfect , ”
105479	105522	105523	105523	She	1784	“ Derek is a fool for not kissing you last night . And I ’m sorry that he left you feeling anything less than what you truly are . Fuck . I ’m so sorry for how I treated you last night . ”
105528	105553	105525	105525	her	1784	“ In that moment , I needed it . I needed to feel wanted and beautiful . I ’m just sorry I used you . ”
105554	105579	105580	105580	She	1784	“ You did n’t use me , Kelsey . I wanted that just as much as you did . There was no using involved . ”
105584	105593	105594	105594	She	1784	“ Well , I guess , thank you . ”
105603	105637	105594	105594	She	1784	“ I know you said we ’re short - term companions and you will probably deny it until you ’re blue in the face , but your friendship means a lot to me . ”
105692	105699	105680	105680	I	0	“ Yeah , same , babe . ”
105746	105749	105742	105742	Kelsey	89	“ Hi . ”
105750	105756	105757	105757	Lottie	89	“ Hey , good morning , ”
105760	105777	105757	105757	Lottie	89	“ Hope this was n’t too early . I know you had a date last night . ”
105783	105794	105795	105795	Kelsey	89	“ No , this is fine . Is everything okay ? ”
105798	105809	105810	105810	I	0	“ She ’s worried you ’re going to fire her , ”
105819	105826	105827	105827	Huxley	90	“ Why would I fire you ? ”
105834	105841	105827	105827	Huxley	90	“ You ’re doing excellent work . ”
105842	105852	105853	105853	Lottie	89	“ Oh , that ’s just how Kelsey is , ”
105856	105876	105853	105853	Lottie	89	“ She always thinks she ’s going to get fired . But this has nothing to do with work . ”
105877	105884	105885	105885	Huxley	90	“ No , nothing like that , ”
105888	105911	105885	105885	Huxley	90	“ And for the record , Kelsey , you have nothing to worry about . JP took care of Regis last night . ”
105933	105942	105925	105925	I	0	“ So what ’s the phone call for ? ”
105953	105988	105943	105943	Lottie	89	“ Well , while going through all these wedding meetings , we ’ve come to the conclusion that a big fancy wedding is n’t necessary . We ’re getting married in a month instead . ”
105989	105993	105994	105994	Kelsey	89	“ A month ? ”
105997	106015	105994	105994	Kelsey	89	“ Oh wow , that ’s really soon . Will you have enough time to plan everything ? ”
106016	106036	106037	106037	Huxley	90	“ Yes . You ’d be surprised how quickly things can get done when the right checkbook is involved , ”
106040	106106	106037	106037	Huxley	90	“ It ’s true . He ’s been flashing around dollar signs to everyone , and things are getting done . But we ’re calling because it ’s going to be a rooftop wedding in Malibu that overlooks the ocean . We ’re inviting about one hundred people and keeping it pretty small . Do n’t worry , you each get a plus - one . ”
106112	106126	106107	106107	Lottie	89	“ Maybe you can bring Derek . Dave and Ellie will be there . ”
106130	106135	106136	106136	Kelsey	89	“ Yeah , maybe , ”
106145	106196	106140	106140	her	89	“ Anyway , we ’ll send the details over shortly . We wanted to call you and tell you the big news . When it came down to it , we just wanted to be married , so we thought this would be a perfect combination for both of us . ”
106197	106201	106202	106202	Kelsey	89	“ Sounds dreamy , ”
106313	106328	106329	106329	Kelsey	89	“ Are you still going to have a bridal shower or anything like that ? ”
106332	106365	106329	106329	Kelsey	89	“ Um , I think just a lingerie party . Something small . Nothing too crazy . We do n’t need anything , but I know Hux here would appreciate the lingerie . ”
106371	106375	106376	106376	Bing	222	“ I would . ”
106609	106619	106620	106620	Huxley	90	“ JP , do you still need to talk ? ”
106636	106647	106648	106648	I	0	“ What ? Ah , nah , I ’m good , ”
106661	106664	106665	106665	Huxley	90	“ Okay . ”
106669	106677	106665	106665	Huxley	90	“ Text me if you need anything . ”
106678	106685	106686	106686	Kelsey	89	“ So excited for you two , ”
106723	106737	106716	106716	she	89	“ What did Huxley mean when he said you took care of Regis ? ”
106753	106759	106745	106745	I	0	“ Nothing to worry about . ”
106760	106765	106766	106766	she	89	“ I am worried , ”
106773	106788	106766	106766	she	89	“ Clearly , it had something to do with me . What was it ? ”
106789	106818	106745	106745	I	0	“ He was just being a dick and I set him straight , is all . It ’s not a big deal so do n’t make it one . ”
106819	106829	106830	106830	I	0	“ You saw him at the ball last night ? ”
106846	106863	106830	106830	I	0	“ Yes , I saw him there last night . Addressed the issue and moved on . ”
106864	106870	106745	106745	I	0	“ What was the issue ? ”
106871	106890	106891	106891	She	89	“ Jesus , Kelsey , I said it was n’t a big deal , so just drop it . ”
106898	106927	106891	106891	She	89	“ Okay , I just . . . I do n’t know . I thought if I understand what ’s going on , maybe I can do better . ”
106928	106955	106956	106956	I	0	“ You do n’t need to do better . I told you , you ’re perfect . Regis was the one who needed to do better . ”
106979	106985	106956	106956	I	0	“ Where are you going ? ”
106986	106991	106992	106992	I	0	“ To my room , ”
106995	107001	106992	106992	I	0	“ You seem angry again . ”
107022	107035	107017	107017	I	0	“ We just do n’t need to talk about it , okay ? ”
107036	107039	107040	107040	she	1803	“ Okay , ”
107051	107058	107040	107040	she	1803	“ What are you doing today ? ”
107059	107063	107064	107064	I	0	“ Not sure , ”
107067	107076	107064	107064	I	0	“ But it seems like you have plans . ”
107077	107087	107088	107088	She	1803	“ Yeah , I guess you saw those messages . ”
107097	107106	107088	107088	She	1803	“ What do you think I should do ? ”
107121	107146	107090	107090	her	1803	“ I thought we had a good time , but I felt really let down by him last night . I do n’t know . ”
107147	107159	107160	107160	I	0	“ Seems like you have a choice to make , then , ”
107163	107174	107175	107175	she	1803	“ But what if it ’s not the right choice ? ”
107179	107197	107175	107175	she	1803	“ I ’m sure it ’ll be a better choice than the one you made last night , ”
107306	107316	107317	107317	Breaker	97	“ Dude , how many drinks have you had ? ”
107320	107324	107325	107325	I	0	“ Not enough , ”
107601	107632	107597	107597	he	97	“ And what ’s with the pigeon pictures ? Should I be worried ? Those things shit all over the place , so do you really want to adopt one ? ”
107633	107641	107642	107642	I	0	“ You shit all over the place , ”
107645	107728	107642	107642	I	0	“ Do n’t talk about the pigeons like that . There are thousands of pigeons being euthanized because no one wants to adopt them . No one wants to take care of their vet bills . Everyone wants to be the person who saves the cute kitten with one eye , the dog in a wheelchair , or the rabbit with no teeth . But what about the flightless pigeons ? For fuck ’s sake , who ’s taking care of them ? ”
107729	107746	107597	107597	he	97	“ Hey , JP , dude . . . are you having a mental health crisis ? ”
107747	107750	107751	107751	I	0	“ No , ”
107756	107910	107751	107751	I	0	“ I ’m not . I ’m just a concerned citizen . You walk around these streets , never noticing pigeons , thinking they ’re just an accessory to a Bob Ross landscape , and then , bam , you hear pigeons are being euthanized and the world comes tumbling down around you . Sure , I saved the polar bears today because looking at those emaciated motherfuckers made me physically ill but , dude , I ’m going to start a goddamn campaign , and the logo will be a pigeon in flight . And the money will go to saving all the pigeons because no one cares about them . No one thinks they ’re worth their time . Just because a pigeon might have a fucked - up childhood and ca n’t fly like the rest of the birds , that does n’t mean that the pigeon should be isolated . ”
107911	107928	107597	107597	he	97	“ Uh . . . JP , are you . . . are you a pigeon ? ”
107929	107949	107597	107597	he	97	“ I ’m a fucking man , you nimrod ! Jesus Christ , are you even listening to me ? ”
107950	107957	107751	107751	I	0	“ Are you listening to yourself ? ”
107958	107988	107751	107751	I	0	“ I am . I am listening , and I ’m pretty sure I ’m the only one who fucking cares about those angelic , stout - bodied birds . ”
107989	107999	107597	107597	he	97	“ So , are you going to adopt one ? ”
108000	108025	107597	107597	he	97	“ What ? God , no . Fuck , imagine me with a goddamn pigeon . What the hell would I do with it ? ”
108026	108046	107751	107751	I	0	“ I honestly do n’t know , dude . You sound like you need a hobby or a friend . ”
108047	108052	108053	108053	I	0	“ Or a girlfriend , ”
108064	108068	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ A girlfriend ? ”
108072	108093	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ Tell me more about this , because as far as I know , you ’ve never really wanted one . ”
108094	108153	107597	107597	he	97	“ Well , you know what , fuckstick ? People change . Okay ? Why ca n’t anyone see that ? People fucking change , and I think it ’s time that we all sit down , have a glass of wine , and talk about how someone named a freaking pigeon Kazoo and got away with it . ”
108154	108163	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ What ’s wrong with the name Kazoo ? ”
108164	108206	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ It ’s such a slap in the face to the pigeon community . Let ’s name this majestic feathered friend after a simple twenty - five cent child ’s toy that gives the vocalist a timbral quality when playing it . ”
108207	108223	107597	107597	he	97	“ I love you , man , but I really think you ’ve lost it . ”

108233	108251	108230	108230	my	0	“ Nope , I ’m seeing things so fucking clearly right now . Like a goddamn crystal . ”
108252	108261	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ It seems like that crystal is foggy . ”
108262	108273	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ Fuck , do you know what I should do ? ”
108274	108279	108230	108230	my	0	“ Seek a counselor ? ”
108280	108287	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ I should send an email . ”
108288	108309	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ Uh , what sort of email ? You know , sending emails while intoxicated is never a good idea . ”
108310	108327	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ I ’m not intoxicated . I ’m finally seeing things the way that I should . ”
108328	108334	108335	108335	Breaker	97	“ And how is that ? ”
108338	108362	108335	108335	Breaker	97	“ Well , I want a girlfriend , and I need a date for the wedding , so I should send an email . ”
108363	108385	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ Wait , can we go back to this ‘ wanting a girlfriend ’ thing ? Where ’s this coming from ? ”
108386	108396	108069	108069	Breaker	97	“ Dude , ca n’t you fucking keep up ? ”
108397	108447	108448	108448	I	0	“ No , I really ca n’t . One moment you ’re talking about pigeons , and the next you ’re saying you ’re going to send an email about girlfriends . I really think we should slow down , reel it in , and maybe drink some coffee . ”

She ’s so fucking pretty , and her smile makes me happy , and the way she laughs creates a bolt of lust straight to my cock . And she ’s so weird and quirky and likes love but is terrible at it for some reason . And fuck is she uptight about things like organization and she loves being right , but I like that about her because she ’s neurotic and I ’m a bit neurotic in my own way — fucking pigeons , you know , man — so I think we ’d make a great fucking couple but she does n’t like me and just wants to be my friend because she thinks that I ’m just some player who ca n’t commit and , sure , maybe that ’s in my past , but like I said , people change and I want to change for her , but she does n’t want to see that so she friend - zoned me and she ’s now going out with Derek , who did n’t even fucking kiss her on the first date , what a douche . He shook her hand . Like , dude , have you fucking seen this girl ? She ’s not handshake material , she ’s marriage material . She ’s the girl that you take home to your parents . You do n’t fucking shake her hand at the end of a date , you kiss her , claim her , make her yours . Well , she ’s going out with him again , so I need a girlfriend , so I ’m going to send an email . ”

Maybe cap that bottle you ’re drinking from , go get some food , and park it in your room for the rest of the night . You do n’t want to say or do something stupid . If you really like Kelsey , then let me help you figure out a way to show that . ”

Huxley constantly pushed boundaries , and always tried to be the best , the first . Breaker was the easygoing one who just went with the flow . Did n’t really care much about anything other than doing the right thing and having a good time . And then I kind of wandered around , attempting to find my place . Never really did . Never felt like I belonged . . . unless I was hanging with my dad . He did n’t get much time off , he was driven like Huxley , but the time I did get with him , he made me feel like I meant something . Like I had something special to offer the world . ”

We ’d do five rounds each , grab a lemonade and nachos from the concession stand , then sit at our favorite picnic table and just talk . There were days where we talked for longer , and some days we did n’t talk at all . Breaker and Huxley were never that close with Dad . They never came with us , so when he passed away , I suffered from the loss the most . ”

I like the idea of being able to help people out . I was thinking , if Huxley says yes , maybe we could start a division in the company , named after the Angelica , that focuses on low - income households that provides them with not just a roof over their heads , but a roof filled with opportunity . We donate a lot of money to different charities and organizations , but I ’d love to do something inhouse , something that focuses on helping the people in the cities where we make billions . ”

I have a few questions about write - offs for him , as well . And then I ’ll write everything up , put it in a proposal , and deliver it to him .

119053	119093	118947	118947	I	0	“ Because I know there could be so much more intimacy involved . I ’ve had just random fucks , but with the right ambiance , with the correct amount of foreplay , I know it could be explosive . ”
119106	119111	119112	119112	he	1929	“ What about you ? ”
119115	119137	119112	119112	he	1929	“ Do you have an ideal situation planned in your head where you ’d have the best sex of your life ? ”

119203	119226	119198	119198	I	0	“ No . For a girl who ’s obsessed with love , it ’s sad how my love life has turned out . ”
119227	119251	119252	119252	He	1929	“ Not sad , you ’re just not settling , and I think that ’s smart . You will find the right person . ”
119260	119291	119252	119252	He	1929	“ But in the meantime , unleash the secret you ’ve been holding all night . What ’s this dessert you got us that you wo n’t tell me about ? ”

120703	120753	120693	120693	he	87	“ Shame . You never experienced a sandpaper tongue on the back of your hand . Or the feel of a cat ’s claw seeping through the threads of your clothing , straight into your flesh . Or the absolute pleasure of sifting shit out of a litter box . ”
120754	120761	120762	120762	I	0	“ Yes , an absolute shame , ”

120775	120833	120693	120693	he	87	“ Huxley and I called her Cat , because we did n’t have any feelings toward her . She was more of an annoying asshole than anything . Always clawed the shit out of us . But Breaker was best friends with the cat . Her name was technically Jiggles . Have you ever watched New Girl ? ”
120834	120841	120762	120762	I	0	“ Yes , love that show . ”

120897	120921	120922	120922	JP	87	“ I ca n’t see it . Breaker seems so cool and calm . I ca n’t see him fussing over a cat . ”
120925	120983	120922	120922	JP	87	“ Man , does he have you fooled . Sure , he ’s cool and calm , but he ’s the biggest nerd . Loves data , has autographs from every cast member of The Lord of the Rings , and he has been known to dress up a time or two as a calculator for Halloween . ”
120984	120990	120991	120991	I	0	“ What ? No way . ”
120996	121003	120991	120991	I	0	“ That ca n’t be true . ”

121047	121066	121042	121042	he	1957	“ Henry Cavill , he built his own computer and recorded the whole thing . It was hot . ”

121088	121110	120922	120922	JP	87	“ Then again , Henry is such a dreamboat . The chin dimple , the seductive eyes , the unbelievable muscles . ”

121165	121224	120922	120922	JP	87	“ Uh - huh . And let me guess — she asked for your autograph and then was extremely embarrassed that she thought you were someone else , she apologized profusely , you consoled her , bought her a drink , and then took her home that night . Was she one of the hot - tub girls ? ”
121225	121228	121229	121229	he	1958	“ No , ”
121233	121244	121229	121229	he	1958	“ But the rest of that story is scarily accurate . ”
121245	121279	120922	120922	JP	87	“ Figured . When I was in college , there was this wave of girls who would pull that trick on guys all the time to get free drinks and an easy lay . ”

121381	121400	121401	121401	He	1958	“ You were off limits . I did n’t have a choice but to friend - zone you . ”
121419	121426	121401	121401	He	1958	“ Why was I off limits ? ”
121504	121535	121492	121492	I	0	“ Because you ’re Huxley ’s brother . Because my company falls under your management . Because I knew you were in a different frame of mind than I am . ”
121536	121549	121550	121550	I	0	“ And if those were n’t factors , then what , Kelsey ? ”

132413	132454	132406	132406	He	87	“ Ever since the moment you walked off the elevator at Cane Enterprises , I ’ve been waiting for the moment to call you my girl . Slowing down wo n’t kill me , it ’ll just make it better . ”
132483	132487	132406	132406	He	87	“ Thank you . ”
132488	132494	132495	132495	My	0	“ Do you feel better ? ”

132537	132571	132406	132406	He	87	“ Yeah , then I have to run across town to meet up with Edison about another building we ’re interested in . Unfortunately , I wo n’t see you until the airplane . ”

132583	132590	132511	132511	I	0	“ Yup , packed this morning . ”
132591	132600	132601	132601	He	87	“ How ? I feel half - awake . ”
132604	132618	132601	132601	He	87	“ Babe , plugging into you last night gave me all the energy . ”
132619	132622	132623	132623	I	0	“ Eww . ”
132629	132638	132623	132623	I	0	“ Do n’t say you plugged into me . ”
132656	132670	132671	132671	He	87	“ Nah , babe , I ’m just high on excitement right now . ”
132679	132703	132671	132671	He	87	“ It means more to me than you will ever know , when you came back last night , when you chose me . ”
132704	132711	132712	132712	I	0	“ It was an easy choice , ”
132723	132736	132737	132737	He	87	“ Fuck , I wish I did n’t have two meetings today . ”
132750	132759	132737	132737	He	87	“ I ’ll see you on the plane ? ”
132760	132763	132764	132764	I	0	“ Yes , ”

132789	132792	132793	132793	He	87	“ Yeah ? ”
132799	132819	132793	132793	He	87	“ I ’m really glad you came to San Francisco . I know you really did n’t want to . ”
132820	132830	132831	132831	He	87	“ Only because I was fucking infatuated with you . ”
132834	132841	132831	132831	He	87	“ See you at the airport . ”
133716	133729	133730	133730	I	0	“ You did n’t have to help me up to my apartment , ”
133746	133764	133739	133739	JP	87	“ Do you really think I was going to let you carry your luggage up here alone ? ”
133765	133770	133771	133771	I	0	“ I guess not . ”
133800	133809	133789	133789	JP	87	“ You can just set it over here . ”
133810	133816	133817	133817	JP	87	“ This is your place ? ”
133832	133882	133817	133817	JP	87	“ Yeah . It ’s small , I know , but it does the job . I hope to get a bigger place at some point , but it ’s hard to find an apartment that ’s in a good area and does n’t cost me my whole paycheck . ”
133941	133953	133931	133931	he	87	“ I like it , babe . It ’s very you . ”
133954	133965	133931	133931	he	87	“ It ’s small , nothing compared to your house . ”
133966	133975	133976	133976	he	87	“ Why do you have to do that ? ”
133979	134002	133976	133976	he	87	“ Put down your place ? It ’s not a competition . This is where you live , be proud of it . ”
134008	134038	134039	134039	He	87	“ You ’re right . I do like my place . It ’s served me well . But I do hope to have a place bigger than this someday . ”
134057	134069	134039	134039	He	87	“ Until then , maybe we can make some memories here . ”
134070	134079	134039	134039	He	87	“ What kind of memories are you suggesting ? ”
134080	134101	134039	134039	He	87	“ Well , I was thinking we can cuddle on your bed , share some ice cream , and talk ? ”
134102	134127	134128	134128	I	0	“ Jonah Peter Cane , the man who has sex on the brain twenty - four hours a day , just wants to talk ? ”
134135	134179	134180	134180	I	0	“ What did I tell you ? You said you want to take this slow , so that ’s what we ’ll do . I want to spend some more time with you before I have to kiss you good night and leave . ”
134189	134221	134180	134180	I	0	“ Being the romantic girl that I am , I ’ve always dreamed of someone saying they want to spend more time with me , but I ’ve never heard it . ”
134222	134243	134244	134244	he	87	“ Because you were n’t with the right guy . No need to look anymore . I ’m right here , ”
134255	134291	134244	134244	he	87	“ And , thankfully , ice cream will be here shortly . I asked our driver , Ramon , to stop by the corner store to grab us some , banking on you saying yes . ”
134292	134300	134180	134180	I	0	“ And what if I said no ? ”
134301	134313	134314	134314	I	0	“ Then I would ’ve gone home and eaten my feelings . ”
134321	134352	134314	134314	I	0	“ How about this — we eat ice cream and I unpack while we talk , because I ca n’t possibly be in my apartment with two untouched luggage bags . ”
134353	134368	134369	134369	I	0	“ I can help . I can sort your lingerie , if you want . ”
134380	134404	134369	134369	I	0	“ You just hang out there and talk to me while I unpack . I do n’t need you messing with my system . ”

134488	134502	134503	134503	JP	87	“ Do you do this every time you come home from a trip ? ”
134515	134518	134503	134503	JP	87	“ Yes . ”
134519	134528	134443	134443	He	87	“ What happens when you arrive home late ? ”
134529	134537	134503	134503	JP	87	“ Then I go to bed late . ”
134538	134562	134563	134563	I	0	“ So , you ’re telling me , you need to steam and disinfect all of your shoes before you go to bed ? ”
134588	134626	134563	134563	I	0	“ Yes . If I do n’t , I wo n’t get any sleep . I told you , I have a system , and that system must be followed before I can tuck myself into bed . ”
134627	134641	134659	134659	I	0	“ I see . . . why do I find it strangely sexy ? ”
134642	134648	134649	134649	I	0	“ Because you ’re deranged , ”
134688	134694	134659	134659	I	0	“ Where do those go ? ”
134695	134747	134659	134659	I	0	“ In storage . There ’s a unit in the basement of the apartment building . It ’s where I keep my holiday décor as well as any extra supplies like toilet paper , paper towels , and anything I might have purchased a surplus of because of a great coupon . ”
134748	134767	134768	134768	I	0	“ You ’re so fucking efficient , it makes me want to bury my head between your breasts . ”
134771	134783	134768	134768	I	0	“ Are you saying you do n’t have a surplus room ? ”
134784	134795	134659	134659	I	0	“ Uh , I think mine is called a pantry . ”
134796	134805	134806	134806	He	2090	“ Ah , true . Is it organized ? ”
134809	134822	134806	134806	He	2090	“ I think your nipples would curdle if you saw my pantry . ”
134823	134833	134659	134659	I	0	“ What about your bathroom ? Is that organized ? ”
134834	134852	134659	134659	I	0	“ My toothpaste has a specific spot on my counter , if that ’s what you mean . ”
134853	134862	134863	134863	He	2090	“ Your fridge , is it color coordinated ? ”
134871	134883	134863	134863	He	2090	“ I do n’t even think there ’s food in there . ”
134884	134898	134659	134659	I	0	“ Under your sink , are there drawers to hold your dishwasher pods ? ”
134899	134906	134863	134863	He	2090	“ I do n’t do dishes . ”
134911	134914	134863	134863	He	2090	“ Laundry ? ”

134939	134977	134978	134978	He	2090	“ Babe , I ’m going to settle that craziness in your voice right now and tell you there ’s no way in hell you will walk into my house and feel comfortable . It is unorganized . ”
134992	135010	134986	134986	his	2090	“ That ’s why I think it ’s great that we spend a lot of time here . ”
135011	135024	135025	135025	I	0	“ Oh , no way . Uh - uh , not happening . ”
135030	135042	135025	135025	I	0	“ Tomorrow , we shall spend our date organizing your house . ”
135050	135057	135043	135043	He	2090	“ That ’s not a date . ”
135058	135105	135025	135025	I	0	“ It is to me . I do n’t think anything would make me happier than seeing you organize your shoes . Ooo , and we can go to the container store together , grab some food to go , and then just have a frenzy . ”
135106	135113	135043	135043	He	2090	“ That does n’t sound appealing . ”
135132	135156	135126	135126	my	0	“ I ’ll wear a crop top , something where you can slip your hands around my bare skin whenever you get frustrated . ”

135170	135212	135213	135213	He	2090	“ And you ’ll be granted one solid make - out session , because frankly , I know I ’ll be excited from all the organizing , and I ’ll want some one - on - one lip time with you . ”
135216	135236	135213	135213	He	2090	“ Are you going to be mean about it ? Or will you be gentle with my disorganized soul ? ”
135248	135254	135237	135237	I	0	“ Gentle . Always gentle . ”
135288	135313	135272	135272	he	2090	“ You know I want to make you happy , but do you really want to spend our first date at my place organizing ? ”
135314	135318	135319	135319	He	2090	“ I do . ”
135326	135340	135319	135319	He	2090	“ Fine , but our next date is my idea . Got it ? ”
135341	135348	135349	135349	I	0	“ I think that ’s fair . ”
135399	135402	135407	135407	I	0	“ Kelsey . ”

135430	135438	135439	135439	I	0	“ What the hell are you wearing ? ”
135451	135466	135439	135439	I	0	“ Clothes . I told you I ’d wear a crop top for you . ”
135492	135503	135487	135487	I	0	“ Yes , but you ’re not wearing a bra . ”
135519	135529	135514	135514	I	0	“ Oh , huh , must have forgotten it . ”
135540	135549	135530	135530	His	2090	“ That ’s not what we agreed upon . ”
135550	135563	135530	135530	His	2090	“ Are you complaining about me not wearing a bra ? Really ? ”
135564	135575	135530	135530	His	2090	“ Yes . . . you ’re making me hard . ”
135576	135587	135530	135530	His	2090	“ Control yourself . We have more organizing to do . ”
135588	135602	135530	135530	His	2090	“ It ’s been two hours . Ca n’t we take a break ? ”
135603	135614	135530	135530	His	2090	“ And where do you suppose we take a break ? ”
135615	135642	135643	135643	I	0	“ Outside . You have n’t even seen my pool or backyard . We can stare at the stars , take a breath for a second . ”
135650	135675	135643	135643	I	0	“ Well , I guess we could take a break . We ’ve really accomplished a lot . Maybe a break is in order . ”
135782	135785	135786	135786	I	0	“ Wow , ”
135789	135799	135786	135786	I	0	“ This is . . . this is dreamy . ”
135800	135808	135809	135809	He	2095	“ I thought you ’d like it . ”
135831	135838	135809	135809	He	2095	“ Will you sit with me ? ”
135839	135843	135844	135844	I	0	“ Of course , ”
135887	135891	135892	135892	he	2095	“ This okay ? ”
135930	135937	135901	135901	he	2095	“ It ’s perfect , JP . ”
135964	135972	135973	135973	I	0	“ Why do I know this song ? ”
135989	136009	135977	135977	His	2095	“ It was the first song we danced to at the gala . An instrumental version of Wildest Dreams . ”
136010	136015	135977	135977	His	2095	“ You remembered that ? ”
136016	136019	136020	136020	he	2095	“ Kelsey , ”
136024	136130	136020	136020	he	2095	“ I remember everything that involves you . Everything . From what you wore the very first day I met you — a blue turtleneck dress — to the way you smelled when we shared an elevator for the first time — like vanilla and brown sugar — to the way you tasted the first time I had a chance to be intimate with you — like a fucking sunset on a rainy day . This song . . . it was engrained in my brain , and I just hoped that I ’d get a chance to play it for you again one day . ”
136145	136156	136136	136136	him	2095	“ I had . . . I had no idea . ”
136157	136190	135977	135977	His	2095	“ I know you did n’t . And that ’s okay . I soaked you up from a distance and waited until you could see me as the man I really am . ”
136191	136199	135977	135977	His	2095	“ Why did n’t you say anything ? ”
136200	136247	136136	136136	him	2095	“ I tried , but also , fear got in the way . Pride took over a lot of times . You ’re not an easy shell to crack . You were very professional when we first met , so breaking through that wall was hard . ”
136248	136253	136254	136254	I	0	“ Because of Lottie , ”
136257	136336	136254	136254	I	0	“ Because of what she was doing with Huxley . I know she had to do what she did , both of them did . Slightly unorthodox , but not only did I understand , I approved . But that meant I had to show you guys that we were n’t sisters looking for handouts , you know ? I wanted to keep things as professional as possible . I wanted to show you we were legit businesswomen . ”
136337	136354	136136	136136	him	2095	“ There was no doubt that you were , but I understand what you ’re saying . ”
136355	136383	136136	136136	him	2095	“ And frankly , when I first saw you , I knew you were trouble . I thought . . . God , he ’s so handsome . ”
136384	136388	136394	136394	his	2103	“ Did you ? ”
136403	136468	136397	136397	I	0	“ I did . I really thought you were almost too handsome to look at . My romantic mind was reeling with possibilities , but I put that to bed really quickly because I ’d worked so hard to establish my business , and working with Cane Enterprises was a huge deal . I did n’t want to mess that up with a crush . ”
136469	136483	136397	136397	I	0	“ A crush , no fucking way . I do n’t believe that . ”
136484	136488	136489	136489	I	0	“ I did . ”
136504	136566	136489	136489	I	0	“ At first , it was a crush , but I worked hard to interpret everything you said or did as annoying . That annoyance grew and I was able to block out those original feelings and focus on the business . But with every kind thing you did , I could feel my original assessment of you becoming more prominent . ”
136567	136573	136397	136397	I	0	“ And what about Derek ? ”
136574	136579	136397	136397	I	0	“ What about him ? ”
136580	136589	136489	136489	I	0	“ Why did you go out with him ? ”
136590	136600	136397	136397	I	0	“ Because I was truly looking for my soulmate . ”
136601	136610	136397	136397	I	0	“ Never thought I ’d be that person ? ”
136611	136619	136620	136620	I	0	“ Never thought it was an option , ”
136624	136668	136620	136620	I	0	“ Not just because of business , but because I know we ’re different in so many ways . You ’re more experienced , you ’re more outgoing , you ’re more . . . I felt you were out of my league . ”
136669	136674	136675	136675	he	2104	“ That ’s bullshit , ”
136702	136723	136693	136693	his	2104	“ Kelsey , I ’m nowhere near your stratosphere . Hell , I ’m lucky you even looked my way . ”
136724	136735	136736	136736	He	2104	“ Stop , you know that ’s not the truth . ”
136753	136761	136736	136736	He	2104	“ Babe , it ’s the truth . ”
136793	136804	136805	136805	His	2104	“ Fuck , when you make that sound . . . ”
136827	136847	136817	136817	his	2104	“ Ask me something so I do n’t strip you down and pull you into the pool with me . ”
136871	136873	136869	136869	him	2104	“ accidentally ”
136920	136942	136973	136973	his	2104	“ Umm . . . what , uh . . . what ’s your favorite . . . um . . . ”
136962	136969	136970	136970	he	2104	“ What ’s my favorite what ? ”
137026	137040	137041	137041	I	0	“ God , I do n’t know what I was going to ask , ”

139838	139871	139825	139825	He	2109	“ And when you ’re naked , not only do I own your body , but I tell it when it can come , and you ’re not allowed to come yet . ”
139872	139876	139877	139877	He	2109	“ Why not ? ”
139885	139909	139877	139877	He	2109	“ I suggest you do n’t question me , unless you want to lie here all night , being teased with no relief . ”

This is it , Kelse , this is what you ’ve been waiting for . ”

Our dad sent money , but that was about it . There was no involvement in our life . And then when I was around fourteen , my mom met Jeff . To our knowledge , he was the only boyfriend she had while we were growing up , and we did n’t even know they were dating until after six months . How she did it , I do n’t know , but she was very protective of us . When we finally met Jeff , it was this big relief because we saw how happy our mom was . We immediately accepted him into our family , and he ’s been a rock for us ever since . ”

143841	143884	143803	143803	she	89	“ Never told me . All I know is that the next day , Skylar — the guy I went out with — gave me an apology card and told me it was him who was the bad kisser , not me . ”
143885	143904	143803	143803	she	89	“ That ’s my kind of man . I hope he scared the absolute shit out of Skylar . ”

144134	144166	144124	144124	She	89	“ That ’s a promise . So , now you can focus on your job . Do you need help putting together a presentation ? I ’m good at organizing thoughts . ”

Being Lottie ’s younger sister , it ’s hard not to compare myself to her . And with one failed attempt after another at dating , I have a hard time not feeling insecure about who I am and what I look like . But then you came along , and you ’ve somehow washed away those insecurities . You ’ve made me feel beautiful . ”

147069	147152	147016	147016	I	0	“ I am excited . Not so much about the wedding , but for Huxley to be married and start a family . He ’s always been a sort of father figure to me and Breaker , especially once our dad passed , so I know being a father is in his blood . It ’ll be good to see him take a step back for a second , breathe , and enjoy life . I know Lottie helps him do that . ”

147314	147338	147306	147306	her	2172	“ I ’m sure I ’ll get a pet someday , and it ’ll hate me but love everyone else in my family . ”
147339	147351	147306	147306	her	2172	“ Sounds about right . How many kids do you want ? ”
147352	147411	147306	147306	her	2172	“ One . . . possibly two . But not for a bit . I do n’t want to be banging out kids as soon as I get married . I want to enjoy my wife first , take her around the world , grow experiences before we ’re deep in the trenches of diapers and temper tantrums . ”
147412	147447	147448	147448	I	0	“ I ’m the same way . I still have some things I want to accomplish , experience . I know I want a family , but I do n’t need it right away . ”

147480	147550	147477	147477	I	0	“ I really do . You have a loving , calm heart . You ’re also a beautiful leader , and when conflict arises , you do n’t immediately grow angry like I do . You take a step back and give it some thought before tackling what needs to be said , what needs to be done . I think that ’s a good quality in a mom . ”
147551	147593	147477	147477	I	0	“ Well , I think you ’d be a good dad . You ’re caring , protective , and even though you ’re annoying at times with your constant teasing , I know you ’d bring great joy to your family . ”
147594	147607	147477	147477	I	0	“ That means a lot to me . Thank you , Kelsey . ”
147688	147693	147694	147694	She	2758	“ You ’re welcome . ”
147714	147743	147700	147700	her	2758	“ So , I was thinking , after my dress fitting tomorrow , do you want to come over to my place ? I ’ll make you dinner ? ”
147744	147752	147700	147700	her	2758	“ Can I help you make dinner ? ”
147753	147761	147700	147700	her	2758	“ I ’d like that a lot . ”

147772	147782	147768	147768	her	2758	“ Then , yes , I ’ll be there . ”
147803	147830	147786	147786	Breaker	97	“ I ’m surprised you were able to find the willpower to pull yourself away from Kelsey for one goddamn moment and play basketball with me . ”
147831	147840	147841	147841	I	0	“ Wow , you do n’t sound bitter , ”
147855	147874	147848	147848	I	0	“ Seriously , dude . I ’m losing Huxley . Am I going to lose you , too ? ”
147875	147882	147786	147786	Breaker	97	“ You ’re not losing us . ”
147883	147907	147848	147848	I	0	“ I never see you guys unless we ’re at the office , and you do n’t even have lunch with me anymore . ”

147948	147986	147940	147940	He	97	“ I mean , sort of , and not in a bitchy way , because I ’m happy for you two , but it would be nice if you guys would carve out some time for me . ”
147987	147993	147994	147994	I	0	“ I can do that . ”
148003	148028	147994	147994	I	0	“ Things have just been . . . crazy . And I ’ve been consumed . Dude , I fucking like her a lot . ”
148029	148071	147940	147940	He	97	“ I know . I can tell . And I know Huxley is consumed by the wedding right now , which is in a week , but remember , we ’re all we have . Do n’t leave a man behind . ”
148072	148080	148081	148081	I	0	“ I ’ll make a better effort , ”
148106	148125	148084	148084	He	2181	“ You know , you could possibly find someone to settle down with . The option is there . ”
148126	148146	148084	148084	He	2181	“ Oh , is it ? What love connection are you seeing for me that I do n’t see ? ”
148147	148152	148153	148153	I	0	“ What about Ophelia ? ”
148156	148159	148160	148160	he	2181	“ Lia ? ”
148165	148184	148160	148160	he	2181	“ Yeah . Huxley and I have been taking bets as to when you two will hook up . ”
148185	148214	148084	148084	He	2181	“ Dude , she ’s my friend , not to mention my neighbor , and she has a boyfriend . That ’s it . There ’s no romance . ”
148215	148235	148084	148084	He	2181	“ You two also call each other all the time — call , not text . That ’s weird . ”
148236	148242	148243	148243	he	2181	“ We text , too , ”
148246	148274	148243	148243	he	2181	“ But that ’s beside the point . We ’re friends , that ’s it , nothing more . We established those ground rules back in college . ”
148275	148291	148084	148084	He	2181	“ So , you ’re telling me you never thought about getting together with her ? ”
148292	148295	148296	148296	I	0	“ Never . ”
148299	148307	148296	148296	I	0	“ You ’re such a fucking liar . ”
148347	148359	148338	148338	I	0	“ So , you ’re not bringing her to the wedding ? ”
148360	148382	148308	148308	I	0	“ No . She did knit Huxley and Lottie pot holders , though , that I have to take with me . ”
148383	148397	148313	148313	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you did n’t invite her to the wedding . ”
148398	148407	148338	148338	I	0	“ I ’m bringing some girl named Charise . ”
148408	148418	148308	148308	I	0	“ Some girl ? Do you even know her ? ”
148419	148428	148313	148313	I	0	“ Yeah . She ’s Lia ’s friend . ”
148429	148432	148433	148433	I	0	“ Wait . ”
148436	148450	148451	148451	He	2182	“ You ’re not taking Lia , but you ’re taking her friend ? ”
148454	148499	148451	148451	He	2182	“ I told her I needed a date , and she hooked me up . See , that ’s what friends are for . I was her wingman when she met Brian . Unlike you , I can actually be friends with a woman . ”
148500	148509	148513	148513	him	2182	“ Seems like everything worked out for me . ”
148529	148535	148536	148536	he	2182	“ Do you love her ? ”
148558	148633	148549	148549	I	0	“ Yeah , I think I do . Hell , she ’s all I think about . I ’m constantly counting down the minutes until I can hold her and be with her . And she makes me really fucking happy , dude . I think once all this wedding stuff is done , I ’m going to take her back to San Francisco and tell her . Feels fitting to do it there . ”
148634	148646	148667	148667	He	2183	“ When did you become a man who makes grand gestures ? ”
148647	148663	148664	148664	I	0	“ Ever since I started listening to Kelsey ’s podcast . Have you heard it ? ”
148680	148738	148667	148667	He	2183	“ Well , she ’s all about these stories of how people met . She loves the grand gesture , and she soaks in their romance . You can feel how much she ’s in her element when you listen . Figured if I want to keep her around , I have to step up my game . ”
148739	148764	148667	148667	He	2183	“ Never thought I ’d see the day when you matured into a thoughtful man , but here you are . I ’m impressed . ”
148765	148769	148770	148770	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
148799	148803	148790	148790	Breaker	97	“ AIIIIIIRRRRR BALLLLLLLLL , ”
148827	148834	148835	148835	I	0	“ Thanks for meeting with me , ”
149093	149098	149083	149083	I	0	“ I ’m unhappy . ”
149127	149148	149124	149124	his	2191	“ What do you mean , you ’re unhappy ? In life ? I thought everything was good with Kelsey . ”
149149	149156	149157	149157	I	0	“ Everything is great with Kelsey , ”
149160	149179	149157	149157	I	0	“ This has nothing to do with my personal life and everything to do with my work life . ”
149180	149187	149188	149188	Breaker	97	“ You ’re unhappy with work ? ”
149203	149207	149197	149197	They	740	“ I am . ”
149216	149259	149213	149213	I	0	“ When we started this company , I joined in not because it was something I truly wanted to do — invest in real estate — but because I wanted to be close to you two . Losing Dad , it was — ”
149265	149401	149213	149213	I	0	“ Well , you know how devastated I was . And I was feeling lost , tortured at times with memories , and the only way I knew how to preserve those memories was to stay as close to you two as I could . The jobs were simple . Breaker , you ’d do the numbers because that was what you ’re good at . Huxley , you ’d be the idea man , because you ’re a natural - born leader , and that left me with the leftovers , handling all media and odd jobs . At first , I did n’t mind it , but as time went on , I grew more and more bored . More bitter . Angry that I did n’t feel like I had a purpose . ”
149402	149411	149412	149412	Huxley	90	“ How long have you felt this way ? ”
149415	149494	149412	149412	Huxley	90	“ Probably about a year now . But in the last few months , those feelings have grown to the point of bitterness . And that ’s not what I want . I do n’t want to feel bitter toward the one thing that keeps me close to Dad ’s memory . Close to you both . So , I sat down and thought about what would truly make me happy , what would make me feel fulfilled . ”
149514	149618	149619	149619	Huxley	90	“ I want to start a foundation within Cane Enterprises that focuses on offering affordable housing in our buildings to those who need it . Single parents , low - income families , those struggling to get their feet on the ground . I want to build a community within the housing , offer practical classes like basic DIY home maintenance and managing your finances , have childcare , health management . We ’re bringing in so much fucking money every goddamn day that I think it ’s time we give back , do more than just writing a check to a foundation . ”
149657	149665	149666	149666	Huxley	90	“ And you ’d head this program ? ”
149669	149675	149666	149666	Huxley	90	“ Starting with the Angelica ? ”
149679	149760	149666	149666	Huxley	90	“ Yes . I ’ve laid out the plans for how we can make the Angelica our first affordable housing apartment building . I even spoke with the mayor before I left San Francisco , pitched him the idea , and he said not only would he be willing to work with us on securing more buildings , but he ’d put money toward our initiative when it comes to education , opportunity , childcare , as well as transportation . ”
149761	149770	149771	149771	Breaker	97	“ Have you run the numbers on this ? ”
149774	149777	149771	149771	Breaker	97	“ Yes . ”
149793	149847	149778	149778	I	0	“ With the products the mayor can provide at cost , and the tax breaks , we could break even on the project , while helping others . But honestly , even if we did n’t , it would n’t matter . Profit from even one of our other properties can sustain that . ”
149848	149855	149856	149856	Huxley	90	“ What about your current responsibilities ? ”
149859	149943	149856	149856	Huxley	90	“ Sustainably Organized runs on its own , and I think you know that at this point , Lottie and Kelsey do n’t need us watching over them . I ’d be able to keep up on some of my smaller management projects , and then all the PR — well , I can schedule important meetings , but the smaller fires , those can be put out by someone we hire . It ’s menial work and a waste of my time . ”
149949	149992	149944	149944	I	0	“ This , though , this is the big picture . We can start a wave of affordable living across the country in major cities , expand from California to New York , touch down in Denver and Atlanta , as well . ”
150004	150032	149993	149993	Huxley	90	“ Honestly , I think it would be a substantial hit on our profit , because I ca n’t see how we could make affordable housing profitable . ”
150038	150061	150062	150062	He	2194	“ But . . . it ’s a fucking brilliant idea and I ’m mad I did n’t think of it myself . ”
150071	150197	150064	150064	his	2194	“ One of the best things I learned from Dad about business is sometimes you have to take a hit in order to invest in yourself later . This is a hit , but it will keep investing in our company over and over again , maybe not financially , but morally . We have to run the numbers to ensure we stay viable , ensure we balance the not - for - profits with the revenue - generating properties , which I can see is possible . I ’m guessing we ’d need a not - for - profit license too . Spend time with Breaker and run numbers . You have my approval . Let ’s meet on this again in three weeks . ”
150215	150230	150205	150205	Breaker	97	“ I agree with Huxley and we do need to go over these numbers . ”
150240	150248	150233	150233	his	97	“ But I fucking love the idea . ”
150255	150264	150252	150252	he	97	“ This will make you happy , though ? ”
150268	150272	150273	150273	He	97	“ It will . ”
150283	150295	150275	150275	his	97	“ Does this have anything to do with Kazoo the pigeon ? ”
150306	150313	150303	150303	Huxley	90	“ Who the hell is Kazoo ? ”
150314	150326	150273	150273	He	97	“ Some pigeon JP has been saving during his spare time . ”
150327	150336	150337	150337	I	0	“ I think this was inspired by Kazoo , ”
150340	150357	150337	150337	I	0	“ Well , would you look at that , pigeons really do deserve to be saved . ”
150458	150464	150443	150443	she	89	“ What did they say ? ”
150468	150474	150475	150475	She	89	“ They fucking loved it . ”

151273	151281	151282	151282	She	89	“ Am I nervous ? Not really . ”
151293	151366	151282	151282	She	89	“ I ’m not nervous about my choice . Without a doubt , Huxley is the man for me . I ca n’t wait to be married to him . I ’m just nervous about all the fanfare , you know ? I really wish we just got married back here tonight , and then we could go on our honeymoon , but I understand Huxley wanted more of a traditional wedding . ”
151367	151388	151496	151496	She	2227	“ The ceremony will be short , and then you get to party . That will be so much fun . ”
151389	151423	151282	151282	She	89	“ True . Plus , tomorrow we ’re going to have fun getting ready , right ? Did you get those Mad Libs I sent you a link to ? The bridal ones ? ”
151424	151452	151282	151282	She	89	“ I did . I have them in my bag of things to do tomorrow . Ca n’t wait to insert boob and penis into every category . ”
151453	151475	151496	151496	She	2227	“ Do n’t forget fuck — that can be a verb , noun , adjective . . . it ’s universal . ”
151476	151491	151282	151282	She	89	“ Yes , there will be tons of fucks , boobs , and penises . ”
151492	151495	151496	151496	She	2227	“ Good . ”
151508	151545	151496	151496	She	2227	“ I ’m getting married tomorrow . How crazy is that ? It feels like just the other day I was attempting to find ways to drive Huxley nuts to get me out of our contract . ”
151546	151573	151595	151595	Huxley	90	“ I know . I still remember you telling me you ’d met someone and were going to discuss terms over chips and guac at Chipotle . ”
151574	151590	151591	151591	I	0	“ I think that ’s what won me over — he paid extra for guac . ”

I did everything I could to recover , including convincing this random girl I met on the sidewalk to pretend to be my fake fiancée . I thought I was so clever , getting this woman to be by my side and act like the doting fiancée I needed . Little did I fucking know that I was in way over my head . She was headstrong , breathtakingly beautiful , and the biggest challenge of my life , and I quickly fell for the girl who was supposed to be temporary . But tomorrow . . . tomorrow she becomes my forever . Leiselotte , you ’re the love of my life , and you make me happier than I could ever imagine . ”

154105	154135	154100	154100	She	414	“ Hmm , maybe I ’ll ask for a crotch facial tonight . Huxley hates when I call it that , so now , I always call it that . ”

154151	154185	154012	154012	I	0	“ He ’d probably say yes . Every man likes to show dominance by setting his junk on a woman ’s face . Think of it as a form of marking their territory . ”
154186	154227	154228	154228	I	0	“ It ’s appealing , but I also want to use this vibrator he has in his nightstand . It ’s just a regular one , but I ’m pretty sure he ’s used it in his butt . . . ”

154348	154367	154256	154256	she	2252	“ I do n’t know . I think I should just tickle his balls with the vibrator tonight . ”
154368	154411	154012	154012	I	0	“ That ’s also a winning idea . Ooo , put it at the underneath part of his head . I did that to Huxley and , I ’m not kidding , he came in five seconds . It was so hot . ”

154553	154590	154591	154591	Kelsey	89	“ God , I love a veiny cock . You should see Huxley ’s when it ’s hard and straining . Sometimes I just like to watch it bob up and down when it wants release . ”
154627	154639	154640	154640	Kelsey	89	“ Yes , and tell him how you like his tongue . ”
154663	154667	154668	154668	Lottie	89	“ So sexy , ”
154674	154679	154668	154668	Lottie	89	“ You think so ? ”

154984	155032	154979	154979	I	0	“ I was drunk and desperate . Heartbroken . You do n’t know what those two weeks were like in San Francisco . Seeing her go out with someone else when she would n’t even look my way — fuck , man , it ate me alive . ”
155033	155057	154959	154959	Huxley	90	“ So , you go and send a crude email to a bunch of women asking if they want to be your date ? ”
155058	155080	155081	155081	I	0	“ Well , you fucking told Dave Toney you had a pregnant fiancée . We do n’t always make smart decisions , ”

155175	155211	155167	155167	I	0	“ My goddamn happiness rests on what happens . No matter what , Lottie is going to marry you tomorrow , but Kelsey , she might not even look my way if this gets out . ”
155212	155218	155219	155219	Huxley	90	“ Would serve you right , ”
155222	155225	155219	155219	Huxley	90	“ Hey , ”
155244	155360	155237	155237	he	97	“ You fucked up big time when it came to that bullshit with Lottie . The company ’s reputation was at risk of being demolished , and we stood by your side and helped you . We made sure to go along with everything you needed to make sure no one was harmed . So , do n’t turn your back on your brother . He ’s right , you have no clue what he ’s been going through , not to mention , the fact that he actually allowed someone into his life again after Dad ’s passing . You should be asking him how he ’s feeling , not making him feel worse . ”
155374	155387	155371	155371	he	2273	“ Fuck , you ’re right . Shit , I ’m sorry . ”

155431	155491	155492	155492	Breaker	97	“ How about this . It ’s getting late , so why do n’t you just explain to her what ’s going on , be ahead of the curve , and tell her that you ’re killing the article ? That way , you ’re honest with her , and stopping the possible argument that could break things up , ”
155498	155517	155495	155495	Huxley	90	“ That ’s probably smart . Being caught off guard is worse than having that conversation with her . ”

155722	155742	155747	155747	Huxley	90	“ Because , from the text Kelsey just sent me , I can almost guarantee she ’s completely wasted . ”
155743	155746	155747	155747	Huxley	90	“ Fuck , ”
155782	155788	155789	155789	I	0	“ You ’re so handsome , ”

157136	157196	157130	157130	I	0	“ I came on too strong . I said things that probably scared you . I ’m not the girl you thought I was , that ’s what you ’re thinking , right ? This is why I ’m always vanilla , why I do n’t step out of my box to do things I do n’t normally do . ”
157197	157202	157203	157203	I	0	“ Baby , stop . ”
157215	157231	157232	157232	I	0	“ I get it , JP . You did n’t like what I said tonight . ”
157241	157252	157253	157253	He	2290	“ I should just sleep it off , you know ? ”
157412	157420	157421	157421	I	0	“ I ’m going to fucking puke , ”
157616	157622	157623	157623	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
157627	157632	157633	157633	He	97	“ Is Huxley here ? ”
157648	157675	157635	157635	his	97	“ I did n’t think I ’d bother him with this bullshit . He has a wedding , so I just told him it was handled . ”
157676	157686	157687	157687	He	97	“ Has it been ? Handled , that is ? ”
157700	157712	157692	157692	he	97	“ The article is currently on hold , pending our decision . ”
157731	157737	157728	157728	I	0	“ What do they want ? ”
157738	157791	157689	157689	his	97	“ Well , the good thing is , the person who sent them your email had signed an NDA with the gossip website , meaning they ca n’t sell the story to anyone else . So , if they do n’t run it , she ca n’t take it to another website . ”
157792	157810	157811	157811	Breaker	97	“ Thank fuck for that . But I ’m sure they paid her to sign that NDA . ”
157814	157836	157811	157811	Breaker	97	“ And they want that , on top of what they would ’ve lost in website revenue for clicks , right ? ”
157837	157843	157689	157689	his	97	“ They want two million . ”
157844	157848	157849	157849	I	0	“ Jesus fuck , ”
157855	157861	157849	157849	I	0	“ That ’s fucking extortion . ”
157862	157901	157689	157689	his	97	“ I have Taylor on it . That ’s why it ’s currently pending . They , of course , do n’t see it as extortion , they see it as us buying out a piece of revenue . ”
157902	157905	157906	157906	I	0	“ Bullshit , ”
157909	157929	157906	157906	I	0	“ Show me the goddamn numbers that prove they ’d make two million dollars of revenue off that story . ”
157930	158007	157689	157689	his	97	“ I know , but , dude , this is a dip in the bank that wo n’t make a huge difference . I looked over the numbers , and I can maneuver things around and slip the damage control fee into the books in a way that no one would know , and we ’d still get a tax break for it . We ’re trying to convince them to see it as a donation . ”
158008	158013	157689	157689	his	97	“ That ’s lying . ”
158014	158054	157689	157689	his	97	“ Which is why I thought I ’d talk to you . They said they ’d use some of their website ad space to promote something we ’re passionate about so it looks like a donation on their end . ”
158055	158080	157906	157906	I	0	“ What an entirely fucked - up situation . So , what , they ’re asking what we want to promote on their website ? ”
158081	158093	157689	157689	his	97	“ Yes , and offered to put our name on it . ”
158094	158098	158099	158099	I	0	“ Fuck that , ”
158102	158112	158099	158099	I	0	“ They ’re not getting Cane Enterprises on anything . ”
158113	158214	158215	158215	I	0	“ Dude , I know you ’re upset , but given the situation we ’re in — and wanting to save Kelsey the embarrassment if this got out — it would be smart to take the deal . And just throw down some charity , some random . . . oh , hey , fucking give them the pigeon charity to promote . It wo n’t have our name on it , but we can write it off in the books , and I ’m sure the last thing they want on their website is a sponsored ad about pigeons . ”
158250	158269	158237	158237	I	0	“ You know , there are some real ill - looking pigeons we could get for the ad . ”
158273	158292	158270	158270	Breaker	97	“ Not a good look for them , but it all kind of works out in the end . ”
158293	158314	158360	158360	he	97	“ I need front ad space , for two weeks , and final say in what the ad looks like . ”
158315	158323	158360	158360	he	97	“ Taylor has already worked that in . ”
158324	158327	158328	158328	I	0	“ Okay . ”
158339	158351	158328	158328	I	0	“ Fucking do it . Get this nightmare off my hands . ”
158379	158424	158364	158364	he	97	“ Fuck , dude , can you just listen to me next time ? I might be younger than you , but I ’m pretty damn smart . Sending an email to random girls in your contacts list does n’t scream best idea ever . ”
158425	158437	158360	158360	he	97	“ Yeah , well , hopefully those days are behind me . ”
158438	158458	158360	158360	he	97	“ I ’m guessing , given Kelsey ’s inebriated state , you were n’t able to talk to her ? ”
158459	158512	158513	158513	My	0	“ No , and then she tried on this cute seduction thing . . . fuck . I loved seeing her so open and wanting to try things , but I could n’t participate . I could n’t , in good conscience , fuck her . She was devastated , even cried . ”
158518	158530	158513	158513	My	0	“ I do n’t think I slept more than two hours . ”
158531	158577	158513	158513	My	0	“ Well , this is taken care of . Maybe stop by her favorite coffee place on the way home and make it up to her now . Because our brother is getting married , and we want to be there for him , mentally . ”
158578	158582	158513	158513	My	0	“ I know . ”
158603	158619	158594	158594	He	390	“ Thanks for taking the lead on this . It means a lot to me . ”
158620	158685	158598	158598	his	390	“ It ’s what family is for , dude , and I meant what I said last night . I ’m really fucking happy for you . I know losing Dad was harder on you than Hux and me , and seeing you out there , opening yourself up to love . . . I ’m really happy for you . Proud of you . ”
158686	158690	158691	158691	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
158696	158734	158691	158691	I	0	“ Okay , fuck . . . I feel like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulders . Time to go shower my girl with love . Still meeting at my place in an hour ? ”
158742	158779	158735	158735	I	0	“ Yeah . Why Huxley wants us there so early is beyond me , but he has plans to spend time with his brothers before the I dos . I think basketball is on the schedule . ”
158780	158786	158787	158787	I	0	“ I ’ve been practicing . ”

158806	158841	158735	158735	I	0	“ I ’m not even worried in the slightest . There ’s no way you could ’ve improved to be able to beat me in the short amount of time since we last played . ”
158842	158853	158854	158854	I	0	“ What little faith . See you in a bit . ”
159523	159529	159520	159520	JP	87	“ Where are you going ? ”

159578	159589	159590	159590	His	87	“ So , yeah , happy wedding day to everyone . ”
159595	159609	159610	159610	He	87	“ You ’re just going to leave like that ? No kiss goodbye ? ”
159627	159636	159610	159610	He	87	“ Oh , yeah , kiss , right . ”
159655	159666	159667	159667	My	0	“ Okay , well , see you at the altar . ”
159671	159695	159667	159667	My	0	“ Not our altar , the wedding altar , the wedding that ’s not happening between us , but between Lottie and Huxley . ”

159755	159798	159729	159729	I	0	“ Yup , a zit . And she needs help soothing the zit before the wedding , and if anyone is the zit whisperer , I am . But it takes time to soothe a zit and we ’re on borrowed time . ”
159823	159836	159817	159817	he	87	“ Well , at least let me walk you across the street . ”
159837	159852	159817	159817	he	87	“ Oh , that ’s okay . I do n’t want to trouble you . ”

160061	160084	160085	160085	He	87	“ There ’s a lot going on . He wanted to plan some things with us before we walk down the aisle . ”

160732	160744	160724	160724	Lottie	89	“ With our concealer , no one will be the wiser , ”
160983	161003	161004	161004	Lottie	89	“ So , you never told me how last night went . Did you cash in on your text ? ”

161054	161085	161035	161035	she	414	“ You were n’t that drunk . Did you chicken out on me ? You did n’t have to do the twirl . Was it the twirl that got you ? ”
161101	161114	161115	161115	I	0	“ No , it just . . . it was n’t happening , ”
161125	161135	161122	161122	She	89	“ What do you mean it was n’t happening ? ”
161136	161152	161153	161153	I	0	“ I mean . . . he was n’t . . . in the mood , ”

161198	161245	161181	161181	Lottie	89	“ I mean , he was n’t in the mood . Can we drop it ? Because I feel emotional about it and I do n’t want to be emotional on your wedding day . It ’s supposed to be happy and fun , not depressing . ”
161246	161269	161297	161297	Lottie	89	“ Yes , but I do n’t want you to have to force a smile . We need to talk this out . ”
161270	161273	161274	161274	Ellie	167	“ Hello ? ”
161285	161291	161274	161274	Ellie	167	“ Where are you guys ? ”
161292	161296	161297	161297	Lottie	89	“ Upstairs bedroom , ”

161315	161372	161312	161312	I	0	“ I ’m really . . . I ’m embarrassed . Last night was such a disaster , and the more I think about it , the more I just want to curl up and cry . Trust me , I ’m highly emotional , and you do n’t want that while we ’re getting ready . ”
161391	161421	161380	161380	her	89	“ But you ’re hurting , and I ca n’t have you hurting right now . How could you have any fun today if you bottle it all up ? ”
161447	161481	161482	161482	She	167	“ Sorry I ’m late , the baby was being fussy , and I hate to be that person , but I really wanted to make sure everything was okay before I left . ”
161497	161509	161494	161494	she	167	“ Oh , he told you . How are you doing ? ”
161537	161542	161543	161543	Lottie	89	“ Told her what ? ”
161561	161570	161554	161554	she	167	“ Uh . . . what was that ? ”
161584	161598	161577	161577	Lottie	89	“ I ’m so sorry , but could you give us a moment ? ”
161599	161615	161616	161616	Meredith	255	“ Not a problem , gives me a chance to check in with the kids . ”
161635	161644	161627	161627	Lottie	89	“ What are you talking about , Ellie ? ”
161671	161721	161649	161649	her	167	“ You know , it ’s not a big deal . I just — you looked upset , so I assumed something I should n’t have assumed . Why do n’t we just ignore what I said and have some cronuts ? I got the raspberry - filled ones . ”
161732	161764	161729	161729	I	0	“ Ellie , I ’m a borderline emotional nutcase right now . I need to know what you ’re talking about or I might combust . Please , just tell me . ”
161770	161777	161765	161765	She	167	“ Me and my big mouth . ”
161791	161846	161788	161788	she	167	“ The only reason I know is because Dave told me about it and I was preparing myself for what might happen this morning . But apparently , and I do n’t know when , JP sent out an email to a bunch of women asking them to be his date for the wedding . ”
161847	161850	161851	161851	I	0	“ What ? ”
161871	161877	161878	161878	Lottie	89	“ What does it say ? ”
161881	161910	161878	161878	Lottie	89	“ ‘ Hey ladieeees . Sending a big old cock of an email because , you know . . . I have a big cock ’ . . . ”
161931	161954	161955	161955	She	167	“ ‘ So this email has to match . Here ’s the thing . Hux is getting married to Lulu Lemon . ’ ”
161959	161970	161955	161955	She	167	“ Hey , why is he calling me Lulu Lemon ? ”
161971	161980	161981	161981	I	0	“ That ’s what you ’re worried about ? ”
162000	162010	162013	162013	her	89	“ You ’re right . Email is more important . ”
162016	162070	162013	162013	her	89	“ ‘ And they told me I need a plus - one . Looking for a willing candidate to escort me down the aisle . All expenses paid . Promises of pleasure . If interested , hit me up . I wear condoms still . K. Bye . JP . ’ That motherfucker ! ”
162071	162087	162088	162088	I	0	“ Wait , he said he still wears condoms ? Why would he say that ? ”
162091	162099	162100	162100	Lottie	89	“ Because he ’s looking for sex , ”
162110	162117	162118	162118	Ellie	167	“ When is this email from ? ”
162121	162143	162118	162118	Ellie	167	“ I do n’t know . I just heard it from Dave last night , and then the baby needed me . ”
162144	162152	162153	162153	I	0	“ Does it say on the screenshot ? ”
162181	162188	162170	162170	Ellie	167	“ That was all blacked out . ”
162204	162212	162213	162213	Mom	101	“ Hello ? Where are my babies ? ”
162232	162239	162240	162240	Ellie	167	“ Want me to distract her ? ”
162279	162285	162273	162273	Lottie	89	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
162286	162292	162293	162293	Lottie	89	“ Why are you sorry ? ”
162296	162308	162293	162293	Lottie	89	“ Because this is your day and I ’m ruining it . ”
162309	162326	162327	162327	I	0	“ No , JP is ruining it . Now tell me exactly what happened last night . ”
162335	162387	162327	162327	I	0	“ When we got back to his place , I was all about having sex and doing all the dirty things . He was really reserved and almost standoffish . I said I was going to bed naked and he suggested I wear clothes . It was — it was weird . ”
162388	162393	162293	162293	Lottie	89	“ That is weird . ”
162394	162533	162293	162293	Lottie	89	“ And then , when I threw myself at him again , he said not tonight , and . . . ugh , it was humiliating . I ended up going to bed , and when I thought he ’d cuddle up against me , he did n’t . I woke up this morning to an empty bed . I was humiliated and . . . and I do n’t think he thinks I ’m attractive or that he wants me anymore . Right when I was about to come over here , he showed up and walked me over . He was more loving , still a little stiff . He said he was already out this morning , so he picked me up coffee , but where was he ? Was he doing something with Huxley ? ”
162534	162542	162293	162293	Lottie	89	“ Huxley was with me all morning . ”
162549	162621	162777	162777	her	89	“ God , then I have no idea . But he did give me this really good kiss before I walked up here , but he has n’t texted since and . . . I do n’t know . I ’ve never felt more desired than I am when I ’m with him , but last night . . . last night , I felt foolish , and now this email . ”
162627	162638	162639	162639	Lottie	89	“ What if he sent that while we were together ? ”
162647	162657	162639	162639	Lottie	89	“ Let ’s be rational about this , okay ? ”
162674	162691	162639	162639	Lottie	89	“ Last night , when we were drinking , the boys were in the house talking . ”
162692	162703	162777	162777	her	89	“ Yes , ‘ man things , ’ they said . ”
162704	162733	162777	162777	her	89	“ Which is code for either penis problems , or something to make us think it ’s penis problems so we do n’t go sniffing around for information . ”
162734	162774	162777	162777	her	89	“ Do you think JP was having penis problems last night ? Is that why he would n’t have sex with me ? I mean , I was naked in front of him and he was n’t even hard . ”
162780	162826	162777	162777	her	89	“ No , I do n’t think he was having penis problems , because even Huxley was irritated last night and I doubt his brother ’s penis problem would make him irritated . This was the kind of irritation that I always associate with work . ”
162827	162838	162777	162777	her	89	“ So , they had a work problem last night ? ”
162839	162894	162777	162777	her	89	“ No , I bet you they were dealing with this email . If Dave Toney knew about it last night , he would ’ve told the boys . My guess is , someone got their hands on the email that should n’t have and the boys were trying to take care of it . ”
162895	162902	162777	162777	her	89	“ But when was it sent ? ”
162903	162927	162777	162777	her	89	“ Probably before you guys were together . There ’s no way he sent it after . He really likes you , Kelse . ”
162928	162991	162777	162777	her	89	“ I like to think that he does , but . . . there ’s this feeling I have , this feeling I think I ’ve always had when getting involved with him . I ’m not good enough , not up to his level . I ’m not going to fulfill what he needs in life . We ’re so different . ”
162992	163004	163005	163005	She	2340	“ But you are exactly what each other needs , too . ”
163017	163058	163005	163005	She	2340	“ Your insecurities are misshaping your view of JP . He ’s a good guy . And the more I think about it , the more I ’m convinced this is the boys trying to shield us from the truth . ”
163059	163077	163124	163124	her	89	“ The truth being . . . JP did n’t want to take me to the wedding . ”
163078	163088	163124	163124	her	89	“ Stop it . You do n’t know that . ”

163127	163155	163124	163124	her	89	“ No . He ’d never do that . You should know him well enough at this point to know he would n’t do that , either . ”
163156	163202	163124	163124	her	89	“ But . . . he did n’t get hard . He did n’t hold me . He ’s been so possessive of me ever since we got together , and then , all of a sudden , that just ends ? Something is off . ”
163203	163213	163124	163124	her	89	“ Maybe he was worried you ’d find out . ”
163214	163221	163124	163124	her	89	“ Because he ’s hiding something ? ”
163222	163233	163234	163234	I	0	“ Or maybe because he ’s afraid of losing you . ”
163245	163250	163234	163234	I	0	“ Just text him . ”

163293	163316	163317	163317	She	2341	“ Showing you that everything is okay . I really think this is all a misunderstanding . JP is crazy about you . ”

163465	163542	163455	163455	Lottie	89	“ I told you . Having been around Huxley during work crises , I ’d say this is exactly what happened — someone brought up this email that JP sent who knows how long ago , they did damage control , and JP was worried about it last night . Look at that text . You ’re telling me he does n’t like you ? You ’re telling me he ’d rather be with someone else ? ”

And we did , but I had to rush over to Breaker ’s this morning for some negotiations . After that , I grabbed your favorite coffee , and that ’s when I saw Jill . I was hoping you ’d still be asleep by the time I got home , but because I ’ve had shit luck the past twenty - four hours , you were awake .

168433	168463	168464	168464	I	0	“ It is . What can I do to help ? Want me to talk to her ? I can tell her everything that happened , back you up . ”

168485	168492	168493	168493	he	2443	“ Then what ’s the problem ? ”
168496	168545	168493	168493	he	2443	“ The problem is , in my sheer panic last night , I fucked up . She was vulnerable , and I was too caught up in my own head , worried I was going to lose her . I did n’t give her the comfort she needed . ”

She believes it has to do with her . Last night , she was looking for that reassurance , but like a fucking moron , I did n’t give her what she needed . I did n’t see it then , but now that I played it over in my head , I realize that I ’m the biggest fucking idiot . I inadvertently played into those insecurities . And it makes me fucking sick . ”

168735	168753	168692	168692	he	97	“ Not sure . Feels like it , though , and I only have myself to blame . ”

169695	169726	169727	169727	Breaker	97	“ Wanted the feel of clutching a bottle , but without the alcohol . There ’s something so . . . poetic about clutching a bottle when dealing with heartache . ”

170196	170290	170188	170188	Breaker	97	“ You know , that ’s exactly what an uneducated nitwit would say . Did you know that pigeons are actually intelligent and complex ? They ’re one of the only animals on the planet to pass the mirror test . Meaning , you stick a mirror in front of them and they fucking know they ’re looking at their reflection . Are rats passing that test ? No , they ’re just sitting there , in creepy holes , gnawing at their nuts until they can find something better to chew on . ”

170300	170331	170188	170188	Breaker	97	“ Also , there ’s very little scientific evidence that pigeons carry diseases . And contrary to what ’s blasted all over the media , pigeons are quite clean animals . ”

170560	170569	170570	170570	I	0	“ Then I ’ll explain it to her , ”
170580	170596	170570	170570	I	0	“ I ’ll send her a video , telling her all about pigeon mating rituals . ”
170597	170613	170541	170541	Breaker	97	“ Dude , really bad idea , especially with the way you look right now . ”
170614	170675	170570	170570	I	0	“ I ’ll show her a video . I found this really great one about how pigeons communicate . It made me think of her , especially since one of the pigeons it focused on had some gold feathers on its neck . It reminded me of Kelsey ’s eyes . In my head , I named it Kelsey and — ”

170753	170888	170746	170746	He	97	“ Look around you . You ’re drowning yourself in sugar cane root beer that I can only assume tastes like a foot , you ’re attempting to twin with a goddamn pigeon you ’ve never met , and you ’re naming fictional pigeons Kelsey . This is n’t just rock bottom , this is crossing a line , and to hell if I ’m going to sit back and watch . Now get the fuck up , go take a goddamn shower , and get your shit together , because there ’s no way in hell Kelsey is going to want to talk to a guy who ’s attempting to crack the code on pigeon communication so he can tell her how much he loves her . Newsflash — that ’s not romantic . ”

171010	171046	171001	171001	I	0	“ You ’re right , I really need to get back to work , get back into the swing of things . Who knows , maybe this was the wake - up call I needed . ”

171638	171641	171642	171642	She	89	“ Thanks . ”
171668	171691	171692	171692	Breaker	97	“ She does n’t fucking miss me . Cold as stone . She did n’t even flinch when she heard my voice . ”
171701	171722	171692	171692	Breaker	97	“ Yeah , I actually expected her to be a little more nervous . Or at least show some feelings . ”
171723	171726	171727	171727	I	0	“ Right ? ”
171735	171750	171727	171727	I	0	“ Fuck . It ’s over , is n’t it ? I lost her . ”
171751	171792	171692	171692	Breaker	97	“ I do n’t think you lost her . I just think . . . I think she ’s shielding herself . And frankly , you ’re a goddamn mess right now . Maybe she ’s nervous to approach you . ”

171823	171887	171692	171692	Breaker	97	“ Then fix it , man . She liked you because you ’re charismatic , charming , and a good time . Right now , you ’re just a ball of anxiety who ’s one loaf of bread away from becoming a pigeon man . Show her the man she fell for . Show her the man she ’s meant to be with . ”

God , Lottie , I feel like everything I ’ve been working on this past week vanished the moment I saw him , and I was taken right back to that night . And then I had a meeting with him . Thankfully , Breaker joined us . I held it together , and I ’m actually really proud of myself for acting professionally during the entire meeting . But now that it ’s over , my palms are sweating , and I feel this urgent need to cry , but no tears are falling . ”
