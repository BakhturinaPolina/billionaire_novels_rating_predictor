I thought you might be deeper than it , that you just saw this world differently from me , but you ’re only searching for grim places , and I ’ve been down that boring road before . I want the light , and I ’m good enough at finding it that I can honestly say”—I

12124	12131	12114	12114	she	56	“ Are you ashamed , Pix ? ”
12142	12160	12161	12161	I	0	“ I ’m not ashamed . I just do n’t think it was memorable enough to share . ”
12165	12176	12161	12161	I	0	“ Okay . I ’ll let you have that one . ”
12217	12234	12206	12206	I	0	“ What are you working on that is so much better than all this , anyway ? ”
12324	12346	12347	12347	She	56	“ Just business as always . I may need to research that little company of Mr. Stevie ’s too . Huh ? ”
12350	12390	12347	12347	She	56	“ His name ’s Steven . Or Mr. Samson . And I highly doubt Steven will think your company buying out ours is a good idea , not after our conversation about you not giving a damn about employees . ”
12401	12421	12422	12422	She	56	“ Honey , for the right price , every man thinks my ideas are fan - fucking - tastic . ”
12427	12431	12424	12424	her	56	“ Not Steven . ”
12638	12652	12626	12626	Vick	51	“ You dressed to get into the ocean . Are you planning to ? ”

12681	12698	12676	12676	She	51	“ Jett , I ’m wearing a swimsuit . Of course , I dressed for it . ”
12699	12710	12678	12678	her	51	“ You barely kept it on with that last fall . ”
12711	12726	12727	12727	she	51	“ So , your attention was n’t just on your work this whole time , ”
12736	12791	12727	12727	she	51	“ If you 're insinuating that I was paying attention to you , I can admit to that . Every guy is paying attention to you . The paddleboard instructor ca n’t look away . He ’s too damn nervous he ’ll miss when the strings you call a bikini top inevitably come loose . ”
12901	12932	12891	12891	her	51	“ Jett Stonewood , stop trying to insult me and get your workaholic ass into that beautiful water . No one should be sitting here working , not even you . ”
13038	13054	13028	13028	she	51	“ Careful , Pix , someone might think you had an unmemorable night with me . ”
13207	13217	13198	13198	He	493	" Paddleboarding wo n't make me enjoy this trip . "
13218	13226	13227	13227	He	493	" Have you ever paddle boarded before ? "
13239	13243	13227	13227	He	493	" Of course . "

13290	13298	13280	13280	he	493	" I just learned on this trip . "
13327	13341	13342	13342	I	0	" So , you just suntanned when you went to the beach before ? "
13375	13404	13372	13372	I	0	" My family only went to the beach when I was young . I have n't been to one since high school . This is my first time . "
13415	13418	13412	13412	he	493	" Why ? "
13422	13442	13419	13419	I	0	" Life sometimes gives you lemons and you make lemonade . Other times , you ca n’t make anything . "
13595	13608	13609	13609	He	57	" You have to admit this is kind of fun , Jett . "
13640	13670	13627	13627	he	57	" I 'm getting my exercise in for the day instead of having to work out when I get back to my place , so that 's a plus . "
13671	13677	13678	13678	I	0	" Oh , come on , "
13681	13702	13678	13678	I	0	" You are the epitome of a bad mood . Nothing will make you enjoy this trip , will it ? "
13777	13785	13765	13765	I	0	" What are you doing , Jett ? "
13786	13798	13799	13799	He	57	" Showing you exactly what will make me enjoy this trip . "
13852	13861	13847	13847	I	0	“ Are you joking ? We ca n’t … ”
13992	13997	13998	13998	he	57	“ This bikini top … ”
14007	14012	14001	14001	he	57	“ You love it ? ”
14013	14023	14024	14024	He	57	“ Me and every fucking man on the island . ”
14032	14038	14024	14024	He	57	“ Is that a problem ? ”
14039	14047	14048	14048	I	0	“ You enjoy men looking at you ? ”
14053	14100	14048	14048	I	0	“ I do n’t really care whether they do or not . It ’s all about fun , Jett . Enjoying yourself on a vacation . I enjoy feeling sexy , and if men enjoy looking , I guess everyone wins . They ’re just looking . ”
14143	14170	14133	14133	His	57	“ They do n’t deserve to see this body , Vick . Not like it ’s a piece of meat . It should be a crime . ”
14288	14311	14273	14273	He	57	“ Woman , next time we go to a place you have to wear a swimsuit , wear a damn one piece . ”
14317	14321	14273	14273	He	57	“ No fun . ”
14322	14334	14335	14335	He	57	“ And we all know you ’re all about fucking fun . ”
14608	14616	14602	14602	he	57	“ Jett , stop playing with me . ”
14617	14625	14626	14626	he	57	“ I thought you liked to play , ”

15037	15048	15049	15049	I	0	" Or we could both go at the same time ? "
15059	15070	15056	15056	He	57	" Vick , no one cares what we 're doing . "
15071	15081	15022	15022	I	0	" Speak for yourself . My friends are nosy . "
15082	15104	15056	15056	He	57	" Are they ? Or are you the nosy one and think they 'll ask the questions you normally ask them ? "
15105	15109	15056	15056	He	57	" Brey knows … "
15110	15125	15126	15126	I	0	" She might know something is up , but that girl would never ask . "
15142	15150	15134	15134	I	0	" Whatever . It does n't matter . "
15151	15173	15174	15174	I	0	" I know it does n't . We 're adults . We can do whatever we want in the damn water . "

15217	15232	15209	15209	I	0	" There 's some beautiful coral reef on the other side of that rock . "

15280	15299	15268	15268	Jett	57	" Oh , the reef was exceptional . Under the water , in this light — absolutely exceptional . "

15940	15962	15934	15934	His	541	" Jesus ! Warn someone when you 're behind them . Especially when they 're on the edge of a cliff . "
15963	15979	15980	15980	he	541	" Like I said , move back . There ’s a reason for the fence , "
15995	16001	15988	15988	I	0	“ I 'm not moving . ”
16012	16017	16009	16009	he	541	" God damn it . "

16062	16080	16056	16056	his	541	" Making sure you do n't die on this trip because apparently you have a death wish . "
16084	16091	16081	16081	I	0	" No , I do n't . "
16092	16123	16124	16124	I	0	" You went on about a hundred dangerous hikes and whenever you came across a sign saying danger or caution , you did exactly what it said not to do . "
16127	16135	16124	16124	I	0	" You only live once , right ? "
16136	16152	16081	16081	I	0	" Ca n't enjoy it if you 're dead because you fell off a cliff . "
16153	16170	16124	16124	I	0	" I 'm aware that I ca n't enjoy things if I 'm dead , Jett . "
16171	16177	16178	16178	he	541	" Could have fooled me , "
16392	16396	16397	16397	he	57	" Baby whale , "

16615	16623	16605	16605	I	0	“ They do that sometimes , Pix . ”
16624	16676	16571	16571	his	57	“ This is officially the best trip I ’ve ever been on . I ca n’t believe that happened . I mean , we were just sitting here , and they jumped out like they wanted us to see them , like they wanted to be a part of my day . ”
16677	16693	16694	16694	he	550	“ They jumped out because that ’s what they do . They have to breathe , ”
16697	16700	16694	16694	he	550	“ Fine . ”
16707	16722	16723	16723	His	550	“ They probably did n’t care if I saw them , but still … . ”

16984	16993	16966	16966	He	550	“ I do n’t . I just like to-- ”
16994	17018	16973	16973	him	550	“ Have fun . I know . But vacation ends today when we fly back . You ready to face the real world ? ”
17019	17041	17042	17042	We	556	“ My real world is still fun . I ’m happy to get back to my day - to - day . ”
17050	17058	17042	17042	We	556	“ You enjoy the city that much ? ”
17059	17065	17066	17066	I	0	“ I ’m loving it . ”
17109	17148	17149	17149	He	560	“ The jostling to get to work every morning , the way people are so driven they would literally fight you to get one step ahead . Sounds weird , but the pulse of the city is amazing . ”
17152	17178	17149	17149	He	560	“ I ’m lucky . I get to work near my best friend and do what I love . Steven gave me a great opportunity . ”
17182	17196	17149	17149	He	560	“ Yes . Sounds like Stevie really does you a lot of favors . ”
17197	17204	17205	17205	Jett	57	“ He ’s an exceptional friend . ”
17216	17225	17211	17211	his	57	“ If that ’s what you call it . ”
17231	17287	17226	17226	I	0	“ That ’s what I call it . And I know what you ’re insinuating . I ’m honest . I ’d let you know if I ’d slept my way into a position . But I ’m an associate and Steven has n’t even asked me out yet . I hope he does though . ”
17345	17388	17334	17334	He	57	“ I hope he does too . I ’m sure , even having only seen him on your annoying FaceTime , you would make a picture - perfect couple and your wedding would be just as beautiful as Brey and Jax ’s . ”
17394	17405	17334	17334	He	57	“ You say that sarcastically , but it could happen . ”
17422	17453	17417	17417	I	0	“ One day you ’ll come across the love of your life and your cynical ass will miss it . You ’ll regret it too . Just wait and see . ”
17461	17466	17454	17454	His	57	“ Goodbye , Victoria . ”
17734	17749	17750	17750	I	0	“ I want to make sure this goes back into funds for your family . ”
17753	17769	17750	17750	I	0	“ Brey , you are family . You were before and now you are legally . ”
17775	17785	17772	17772	her	437	“ Still , if you could keep this confidential … ”
17915	17948	17909	17909	their	306	“ I commend you for trying . I understand why , and I would probably try to do the same thing . But the whole family ’s been pretty clear about this . ”
17949	17958	17959	17959	she	362	“ You go around them all the time , ”
17997	18006	18007	18007	She	362	“ That might be true , but Jax — ”
18012	18030	18031	18031	I	0	“ He would probably try to kill you , I know . I ’ll talk to him . ”
18034	18099	18031	18031	I	0	“ My brother fooled you into thinking he can one - up me ? I ’d still beat his ass if he came at me . That said , he has some leverage when it comes to that app of his . I know him . He ’d threaten to tank that app if I helped you funnel money back into the family funds . ”
18103	18111	18100	18100	She	596	“ Can you just think about it ? ”
18112	18117	18118	18118	She	596	“ You want honesty ? ”
18121	18128	18118	18118	She	596	“ No . You ’re family . ”
18152	18189	18190	18190	She	596	“ It will never happen and every time you ask me , you waste more of my time and more of your time . And your time is my time when we have work to do . ”
18213	18216	18217	18217	she	596	“ Right , ”
18241	18297	18229	18229	She	596	“ We handled your two biggest clients . They accepted your offers . We ’ll have a merger happening by the end of next week with the other , and you told the investment team to handle the rest of the businesses . It looks like all but two have accepted our team ’s offers . ”
18298	18304	18305	18305	She	596	“ And the two are ? ”
18346	18350	18351	18351	Aubrey	62	“ Reason given ? ”
18354	18408	18351	18351	Aubrey	62	“ Ah , this feels like something I should n’t be involved in , but you know Vick too . So , I guess she and Steven spoke . He wants what ’s best for his employees and did n’t want to give up the firing and hiring ability along with retirement plans . ”
18409	18412	18413	18413	I	0	“ Hmm , ”
18434	18442	18431	18431	I	0	“ Tell me more about their request . ”
18443	18450	18351	18351	Aubrey	62	“ There was n’t a request . ”
18451	18456	18457	18457	She	62	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
18462	18482	18457	18457	She	62	“ I can send you the email , but there was n’t a counter request . They just refused . ”
18483	18490	18351	18351	Aubrey	62	“ Send me the refusal letter . ”
18496	18507	18491	18491	Aubrey	62	“ Jett , Vick and I are close friends and — ”
18508	18512	18351	18351	Aubrey	62	“ And what ? ”
18513	18516	18519	18519	her	62	“ Well , ”
18522	18556	18519	18519	her	62	“ Our communication is a bit informal because we all know each other . I can have her send an official letter today . I only got word from her earlier this morning . ”
18557	18571	18572	18572	She	62	“ Actually , I ’d like to see the informal e - mail . ”
18706	18709	18699	18699	I	0	“ Brey ? ”
18715	18724	18725	18725	She	62	“ Send me the email now , please . ”
18732	18739	18725	18725	She	62	“ Okay . Before I do … ”
18758	18769	18750	18750	she	62	“ Never mind . I ’ll pull it up myself . ”
18770	18773	18774	18774	she	62	“ What ? ”
18789	18818	18819	18819	She	62	“ This is Stonewood Enterprises . I need access to all my employee ’s emails . For security and efficiency purposes . You ’re being inefficient right now . ”
18828	18842	18822	18822	I	0	“ You ’ll have the research we need for our two o’clock meeting ? ”
18857	18865	18851	18851	she	62	“ Access to everyone ’s emails is — ”
18866	18877	18878	18878	Her	62	“ Company policy , Brey . You read the handbook ? ”
18899	18910	18886	18886	she	62	“ Of course I read the handbook . Did you ? ”
18911	18918	18886	18886	she	62	“ I helped write the handbook . ”
18919	18949	18950	18950	I	0	“ Then you know that the way you are talking to me is n’t right . Do n’t be that boss . Or that brother - in - law . ”
18979	18986	18964	18964	I	0	“ Just be ready at two . ”
18987	18993	18997	18997	she	62	“ I plan on it . ”
20012	20017	20018	20018	she	56	“ Are you serious ? ”
20025	20035	20018	20018	she	56	“ I do n’t want to talk to you . ”
20036	20045	20046	20046	I	0	“ Well , you picked up your phone . ”
20053	20071	20046	20046	I	0	“ Yes , because I happen to think you ’ll interrogate Brey if I do n’t answer . ”
20072	20078	20018	20018	she	56	“ And you ’re right . ”
20079	20087	20018	20018	she	56	“ What do you want , Jett ? ”
20088	20100	20046	20046	I	0	“ Why did n’t you tell me your name is Victory ? ”
20101	20127	20018	20018	she	56	“ Because it ’s a common mistake everyone makes when they meet me . There ’s no need to make someone uncomfortable by correcting them . ”
20128	20156	20018	20018	she	56	“ I ’m not ‘ everyone ’ or just ‘ someone . ’ I slept with you and spent nearly a week with you on an island . ”
20157	20181	20205	20205	her	636	“ And that was a great time . Now the week is over . So , we should probably stop bringing it up . ”
20182	20185	20186	20186	I	0	“ Why ? ”
20198	20201	20202	20202	she	636	“ Why ? ”
20209	20236	20202	20202	she	636	“ Because , as you made abundantly clear , it was just a vacation fling and we ’re back to reality now . Like you said . ”
20237	20252	20205	20205	her	636	“ You did n’t seem to think it was just a fling at first . ”
20253	20269	20270	20270	I	0	“ But you reminded me it was , and I ’m very happy about that . ”
20363	20371	20355	20355	I	0	“ Why are you happy about that ? ”
20372	20390	20343	20343	I	0	“ Because you and I are oil and vinegar . We do n’t mix well at all . ”
20391	20402	20441	20441	I	0	“ Maybe we do . Have dinner with me here . ”
20403	20407	20355	20355	I	0	“ Absolutely not . ”
20408	20412	20343	20343	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
20413	20421	20422	20422	she	636	“ I ’m not a booty call … ”
20425	20440	20441	20441	I	0	“ At least I ’m not anymore now that we are n’t on vacation . ”
20444	20453	20441	20441	I	0	“ Come on , Vick . Just dinner . ”
20454	20464	20467	20467	her	636	“ Honestly , Jett , maybe I would have . ”
20473	20514	20467	20467	her	636	“ I thought we could be more , but you reminded me we could n’t . And I ’m set on finding something serious . I want a boyfriend and a husband and 2.5 kids with a white picket fence . ”
20539	20552	20467	20467	her	636	“ Right . I do n’t want any of that at all . ”
20553	20556	20557	20557	she	636	“ Exactly , ”
20560	20567	20557	20557	she	636	“ We had a good time . ”
20568	20578	20579	20579	She	636	“ Good enough to maintain a cordial business relationship ? ”
20584	20591	20581	20581	her	636	“ That would be ideal . Steven is”—she
20599	20622	20623	20623	I	0	way—“such a great guy . I do n’t want him concerned that my relations with you were anything more than they were . ”
20626	20633	20623	20623	I	0	“ You told him about us ? ”
20634	20643	20644	20644	Vick	51	“ I ’m not telling anyone about us , ”
20648	20655	20644	20644	Vick	51	“ There ’s nothing to tell . ”
20656	20668	20623	20623	I	0	“ Right . Cordial business relationship . Got it , babe . ”
20669	20681	20644	20644	Vick	51	“ Okay . So , hope you have a good night . ”
20682	20690	20691	20691	She	636	“ Sure . Sweet dreams , Victory . ”
20860	20891	20850	20854	One of my team members	627	“ Jett , Mr. Samson agreed to meet with you next week . He wanted me to warn you that he does n’t see himself negotiating any new terms though . ”
20899	20907	20892	20892	I	0	“ Okay . He say anything else ? ”
20908	20925	20926	20926	He	627	“ He went on to explain that he ’s thrilled with his company at this time . ”
20935	20949	20926	20926	He	627	“ He thinks he ’s playing hardball . Just doing his peacock dance . ”
20992	21006	20967	20967	He	87	“ So , you think we need to fluff his feathers next week ? ”
21007	21018	20967	20967	He	87	“ I think the guy ’s excited to meet you . ”
21019	21024	21025	21025	He	627	“ Most people are . ”
21030	21076	21027	21027	his	627	“ Man , get off your high horse . He says he does n’t want to sell , but he ’s bringing his legal team , which means he ’s willing to negotiate . I do n’t know if it 's even worth the investment . ”
21077	21083	21084	21084	He	627	“ It probably is n’t . ”
21094	21114	21086	21086	his	627	“ I figured you knew that . Guess you have your own agenda . I ’ll follow your lead . ”
21115	21125	21126	21126	He	627	“ That ’s what I hired you to do . ”
21202	21211	21212	21212	Katie	79	“ I ’m not dating either of them , ”
21231	21243	21221	21222	The crowd	288	“ You do n’t have to scream at us about it . ”
21455	21463	21464	21464	Katie	79	“ I ’m not screaming about anything . ”
21471	21487	21464	21464	Katie	79	“ Vick , you know what screaming is . Tell her I ’m not screaming . ”
21488	21496	21497	21497	I	0	“ She ’s not screaming , Brey . ”
21518	21543	21507	21507	Brey	56	“ What ’s wrong , Vick ? I would n’t ask except that … well , something is bothering you , is n’t it ? ”
21544	21556	21557	21557	I	0	“ I should n’t have e - mailed your business account , ”
21590	21596	21597	21597	Brey	56	“ Water under the bridge . ”
21602	21616	21597	21597	Brey	56	“ Jax said Jett wo n’t hold that e - mail against me . ”
21622	21627	21617	21617	Katie	79	“ Jax is lying . ”
21631	21653	21628	21628	Brey	56	“ I know he is . But I decided I do n’t really care . Jett should n’t have done that . ”
21684	21691	21671	21671	her	56	“ Your boss is something else . ”
21692	21697	21698	21698	Katie	79	“ Is he now ? ”
21705	21714	21698	21698	Katie	79	“ Why are you asking me like that ? ”
21715	21732	21671	21671	her	56	“ You still have n’t disclosed what you two were doing half the time in Kauai . ”
21733	21750	21751	21751	I	0	“ And you still have n’t disclosed what you are doing with the two Armanelli brothers , ”
21759	21770	21754	21754	Katie	79	“ I said I ’m not dating either of them . ”
21771	21789	21756	21756	her	79	“ That does n’t give us any information . You never admit to dating anyone . Ever . ”
21790	21801	21802	21802	Katie	79	“ Brey knows I ’m not dating either of them . ”
21814	21827	21806	21806	She	79	“ She is n’t , but I think Bastian would n’t mind … ”
21828	21836	21837	21837	I	0	“ Bastian would n’t mind with anyone . ”
21844	21852	21837	21837	I	0	“ Are n’t they in the mob ? ”
21868	21880	21855	21855	her	56	“ You ca n’t date someone in the mob , Katie . ”
21894	21923	21886	21886	she	79	“ No . You date questionable guys all the time , but I think we need to put our foot down with the freaking mob , you guys . ”
21935	21952	21929	21929	her	79	“ Keep your voice down . Jesus . It is n’t the mob , per se . ”

21997	22023	22024	22024	Brey	56	“ You love them ? You ca n’t love people in the mafia . They … wait . Do they do business with the Stonewoods ? ”
22033	22043	22024	22024	Brey	56	“ This is n’t something we should talk about . ”
22044	22054	22055	22055	I	0	“ Well , Katie is dating one of them ! ”
22064	22078	22055	22055	I	0	“ And you just married Jax . If his business is associated with — ”

22205	22220	22221	22221	She	79	“ And , anyway , you do n’t think anything is a big deal . ”
22230	22237	22226	22226	Brey	56	“ No one needs to worry . ”
22243	22255	22238	22238	I	0	“ Does Rome know you 're dating someone in the mob ? ”

24961	24993	24994	24994	I	0	“ All right . Not worried about that , I guess . Did you know my driver could have run you over when you practically dove in front of the vehicle ? ”
25003	25008	25000	25000	She	56	“ Oh my God . ”
25059	25076	25077	25077	She	56	“ I ’m surprised my driver did n’t follow you home too with this fucking outfit . ”

26656	26690	26653	26653	I	0	“ Girl , just call in sick . He ca n’t fire you . Better yet , tell him you ca n’t be there on Mondays . Then you can avoid it forever . ”

26778	26782	26783	26783	She	56	“ Too seriously . ”
26795	26812	26791	26791	she	56	“ All right . Want to go find that vase in the chaos that is Chicago ? ”
26857	26860	26861	26861	I	0	“ Okay , ”

27118	27168	27101	27101	her	62	“ We only have each other here in this big city . Katie only visits once in a while , and she ’s not much good as a confidante . I ’m your very best friend here . Like this beautiful purse , I ’m one in a million . ”

27333	27347	27319	27319	I	0	“ I deserve this handbag for sharing all my crap with you today . ”
27383	27422	27375	27375	She	62	“ He ’s so frickin ’ good in bed , Brey . Like fireworks and explosions good . I want to fuck him all day . And yet , he ’s sort of the worst human being ever . ”

27451	27472	27423	27423	Her	62	“ Right . I make my demons angels though . I like hanging out with people who do the same . ”

27556	27559	27560	27560	She	62	“ Nothing . ”
27577	27593	27560	27560	She	62	“ It ’s just I do n’t normally hear you talk about guys like this . ”
27594	27603	27604	27604	I	0	“ I talk about every guy like this , ”
27607	27608	27610	27610	her	62	“ No”—she

27643	27656	27659	27659	She	62	“ Okay . Well , you did n’t claim that Jett was . ”
27664	27698	27699	27699	She	62	“ Well , that ’s because he literally could never be that . He ’s seriously a devil . Like , take Steven for instance . He would definitely wine and dine me . ”
27702	27712	27699	27699	She	62	“ Steven has n’t wined and dined you yet . ”
27721	27777	27778	27778	Aubrey	62	“ I know . I think he ’s weirded out by the fact that he ’s technically my boss . But he invited me to the meeting with Stonewood Enterprises this week . He knows he should n’t invite an associate lawyer to that meeting . I am a nobody in the company right now . ”
27781	27797	27778	27778	Aubrey	62	“ Hey . You are such a smart lawyer . He wants your professional opinion . ”
27798	27801	27802	27802	I	0	“ Maybe . ”
27805	27835	27802	27802	I	0	“ I ’m green though . It does n’t look good to the others who have been left out of the meeting although they ’ve been there for years . ”

27848	27856	27857	27857	She	62	“ And he looks good doing it . ”
27860	27884	27857	27857	She	62	“ Okay , so we ’re still rooting for Steven to ask you out , and we want nothing to do with Jett ? ”
27888	27891	27885	27885	I	0	“ Exactly . ”
27918	27942	27914	27914	she	62	“ Jax is paying for this one . He said you saved him from the near - death experience of shopping with me . ”
27943	27964	27965	27965	I	0	“ Oh my God ! Why did n’t you tell me ? I would have bought so much more stuff , ”
27973	27985	27968	27968	Her	62	“ Vick , you do n’t have to scream about it . ”

28437	28457	28458	28458	He	67	“ I ’m as ready as I ’ll ever be . Any documents you need me to look over ? ”
28464	28500	28458	28458	He	67	“ Oh , no . I had my other lawyers take a look , but I doubt Jett will offer me anything that will make me change my mind . This is just a formality . ”
28501	28515	28516	28516	I	0	“ Right . We want to maintain a cordial working relationship with him . ”

28571	28595	28561	28561	I	0	“ He has to understand you wanting to keep control of what ’s yours . He does that with his company , right ? ”
28596	28606	28607	28607	He	67	“ Right . And I ’m doing the same . ”
28634	28657	28658	28658	His	67	“ Well , I should get back to it . Let me know if you want to grab a bite for lunch . ”
28674	28677	28678	28678	He	67	“ Right . ”
28683	28694	28680	28680	his	67	“ I probably need to catch up on some stuff . ”

29965	29973	29974	29974	Mark	93	“ Steve , what ’s our number ? ”
30029	30055	30056	30056	Mark	93	“ It is n’t about the number . There ’s a lot more that goes into wanting to give up control of Samson and Sons . ”
30090	30098	30086	30086	Mark	93	“ Still . What ’s the number ? ”
30149	30160	30146	30146	Steven	67	“ I ’ll know the number if I see it . ”
30327	30338	30339	30339	One	95	“ The architecture of this building has always floored me . ”
30342	30367	30339	30339	One	95	“ Yes , the Stonewoods were very much involved in determining the final look . Jax had a hand in developing the elevator design . ”
30368	30379	30380	30380	Steven	67	“ It ’s a phenomenal design . Really quite brilliant , ”
30387	30396	30383	30384	The man	381	“ He and his family are quite brilliant . ”
30431	30440	30426	30426	Steven	67	“ You really enjoy working here , yes ? ”
30441	30465	30466	30466	Steven	67	“ I could n’t have asked for a better position . They push everyone hard but get the best out of them too . ”
30469	30473	30466	30466	Steven	67	“ This way . ”
30502	30521	30522	30522	She	855	“ Gloria , let Jett know I ’ll be bringing Samson and Sons to the conference room now . ”
30779	30792	30793	30793	Steven	67	“ Happy we could meet today . Your company has my attention . ”
30817	30835	30810	30810	He	67	“ I am really happy to hear that . We are looking forward to talking over things . ”
30887	30895	30871	30871	He	57	“ Ms. Blakely . Always a pleasure . ”
30899	30908	30909	30909	He	57	“ Yes , Mr. Stonewood . It is . ”
30920	30933	30909	30909	He	57	“ We ’ll be meeting in the second door on the right . ”
30991	30997	30998	30998	I	0	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
31012	31020	31003	31003	He	57	“ I never kid , Ms. Blakely . ”
31158	31178	31136	31136	He	57	“ I appreciate you all coming here to further discuss how we can help one another in the future . ”
31186	31215	31216	31216	he	57	“ I ’m sure those of you who have met me know I do n’t like to waste time . So , we ’ve drafted a new contract , ”
31255	31363	31364	31364	Jett	57	“ We do n’t want to waste anyone ’s time either . We ’ve already been over everything , and we appreciate the offer . I really like to keep control of things though . My employees mean a lot to me . And I just ca n’t see giving up control of their positions like you ask . I realize that ’s what you do with most contracts . I ca n’t ask you to change that . So , like I said , we appreciate it but today this meeting wo n’t be about acquisition . It will be about maintaining a cordial business relationship . ”
31483	31489	31480	31480	his	57	“ A cordial business relationship ? ”
31516	31526	31509	31509	he	57	“ I swear I ’ve heard that phrase before . ”
31588	31592	31593	31593	Jett	57	“ Either way , ”
31615	31635	31636	31636	She	96	“ I think we should consider more than that . Gloria , would you hand out the new contract ? ”
31904	31908	31892	31892	Steven	67	“ Mr. Stonewood — ”
31909	31927	31930	31930	his	67	“ Jett . We ’re on a first name basis at this point , I would think . ”
31946	31958	31940	31940	him	67	“ We just might be with the number you ’re offering . ”
31959	31971	31972	31972	Steven	67	“ Good . The rest of the contract stays the same . ”
31978	31983	31972	31972	Steven	67	“ Sure . Sure . ”
32123	32132	32114	32114	Jett	57	“ Welcome to Stonewood Enterprises , Victory Blakely . ”
32270	32284	32262	32262	Stevie	67	“ We ’re honored to be starting this journey with you , Jett . ”
32288	32328	32262	32262	Stevie	67	“ Great . Seems the people in this room are indispensable to your company . We ’ll want you all working here starting next week to get everything situated . Gloria will iron out the scheduling details with you . ”
32340	32358	32359	32359	Stevie	67	“ I pride myself on productivity and adaptability . Should everyone here have a desk next week ? ”
32366	32384	32362	32362	he	67	“ Um , well , uh , sure . Yes . Everyone here has something to offer . ”
32400	32448	32387	32387	her	51	“ I ’m sorry . You expect us to move into this building by next week ? Steven , we have obligations , and our colleagues at Samson and Sons are already concerned about the acquisition . Us moving next week will only add to that concern . ”
32449	32462	32463	32463	I	0	“ Thankfully , Stevie — I can call you Stevie , right ? ”
32496	32540	32485	32485	Vick	51	“ Great . Stevie does n’t have to worry about that anymore . We ’ll be taking care of every employee as we always do at Stonewood Enterprises . Lucky for all of you , you ’ll be in our tower next week . ”
32668	32669	32659	32660	The girl	299	“ Antonio,”—my
32674	32680	32659	32660	The girl	299	up—“would you show everyone around . ”
32681	32684	32706	32706	Vick	51	“ Absolutely . ”
32685	32705	32706	32706	Vick	51	“ I ’ll have Ms. Blakely catch up with you later . I ’d like a word with her . ”
32709	32717	32706	32706	Vick	51	“ Oh , that ’s not necess — ”
32721	32731	32718	32718	Stevie	67	“ Great . We ’ll see you both soon . ”
32783	32792	32793	32793	she	362	“ I guess we ’ll be working together , ”
32811	32816	32817	32817	I	0	“ Are you mad ? ”
32838	32845	32846	32846	She	362	“ No . I ’m just — ”
32857	32868	32846	32846	She	362	“ It ’ll be good . This will be good . ”
32869	32886	32887	32887	She	362	“ It ’s good that Stevie gave up his company after you swore he would n’t ? ”
32916	32930	32887	32887	She	362	“ Anyone would have taken that offer . Steven is n’t an idiot . ”
32931	32937	32846	32846	She	362	“ Could have fooled me . ”
32938	32941	32942	32942	She	362	“ What ? ”
32947	32960	32942	32942	She	362	“ How can you say that ? You barely spoke to him . ”
32961	32999	32846	32846	She	362	“ Right . And the grand old speech he came up with was n’t even original . He finished it off with the line you fed both me and him . ‘ A cordial business relationship . ’ ”
33000	33012	33013	33013	she	362	“ You do n’t know that he got that from me , ”
33024	33035	33016	33016	I	0	“ I know damn well he got that from you . ”
33049	33060	33043	33043	her	362	“ Think what you want . You have no evidence . ”
33061	33076	33080	33080	she	362	“ As a lawyer , you should know there are n’t coincidences that big . ”
33096	33114	33080	33080	she	362	“ Either way , Steven ’s smart enough to know an amazing opportunity when he sees one . ”
33115	33196	33197	33197	She	362	“ Or he ’s just like every other person in this world , Vick . Money talks . Little Stevie ’s nothing more than a boy who inherited his daddy ’s business a while ago and has bent to whichever way the wind blew , the water flowed , and the sun shined . I ’m sure those guys have been telling him what to do with that company since the day he walked through Samson and Sons ’ doors . ”
33202	33207	33199	33199	her	362	“ You ’re wrong . ”
33211	33248	33208	33208	I	0	“ He does n’t have a backbone , doll . You and I both know it . He ’ll probably make a perfect husband for you . He ’ll roll over when you tell him to . ”
33273	33314	33264	33264	she	362	“ It is official . I hate someone . I literally hate you . I thought it was impossible . I really do try to see the good in everyone , but there is not one thing good about you . ”
33326	33334	33319	33319	I	0	“ Surely you do n’t mean that . ”
33335	33342	33343	33343	She	362	“ Oh , I mean it . ”
33351	33373	33343	33343	She	362	“ Walk me back to where my colleagues are . I really do n’t want to be alone with you anymore . ”
33374	33383	33384	33384	I	0	“ Not what you said this past weekend . ”
33567	33579	33580	33580	she	362	“ You made it perfectly clear last weekend what we were , ”
33613	33650	33610	33610	she	362	“ You left my bed and my house without a goodbye . Obviously , I was a one - night stand — or whatever number we ’re on — but I wo n’t be one again . ”
33663	33671	33651	33651	I	0	“ That ’s not what that was . ”
33672	33677	33678	33678	She	362	“ Oh , please . ”
33704	33711	33689	33689	I	0	“ I had work , Vick . ”
33712	33718	33719	33719	She	362	“ You always have work . ”
33739	33756	33719	33719	She	362	“ Yes , that ’s true . I really did have time - sensitive obligations though . ”
33757	33770	33807	33807	She	362	“ Well , you did n’t wake me or leave your number . ”
33771	33778	33781	33781	her	362	“ You already have my number . ”
33784	33806	33781	33781	her	362	“ So , you wanted it to be something more than — you know what ? That ’s not the point . ”
33820	33853	33812	33812	her	362	“ My point is it should n’t have happened . I do n’t ever want it to happen again . I just do n’t want to be around you . You ’re … ”
33893	33908	33909	33909	She	362	“ Come on , Victory , you can do it . I ’m what ? ”
33914	33932	33911	33911	her	362	“ You ’re not what I want . But I ’m sure you are for someone else . ”
33933	33955	33911	33911	her	362	“ Good save . You almost gave into expressing how you really feel . We ’ll have to work on that . ”
33956	33966	33911	33911	her	362	“ I ’m not working on anything with you . ”
33967	33974	33975	33975	I	0	“ Oh you are , doll . ”
33983	34003	34004	34004	She	362	“ You work for me now . Starting next week , you ’ll be working on everything with me . ”
34026	34050	34015	34015	I	0	“ I intend to start with working on your honesty . I do n’t want rainbows and roses ; I want the truth . ”
34068	34076	34058	34058	She	362	“ My truth is rainbows and roses . ”
34082	34121	34077	34077	I	0	“ Would it be rainbows and roses if I took you back inside the conference room to fuck you in this dress ? If you were going for conservative , you missed the target by a damn mile . ”
34122	34128	34137	34137	her	362	“ Get fucked , Jett . ”
34129	34134	34135	34135	She	362	“ I intend to . ”
34146	34151	34135	34135	She	362	“ Not by me . ”
34152	34163	34137	34137	her	362	“ We ’ll see , Pix . We ’ll see . ”
34340	34377	34326	34327	One colleague	937	“ You do n’t have to say what I already know , but I ’m probably getting laid off . So , I think you should know that Mark and John have it out for you . ”
34383	34399	34326	34327	One colleague	937	“ Not news to me . They would probably poison me if given the chance . ”
34425	34447	34448	34448	I	0	“ They would probably poison every one of the associate lawyers if we were n’t doing all their legwork for them . ”
34461	34482	34483	34483	She	937	“ They do n’t want anyone encroaching on their monopoly of Steven ’s ear . They practically control his brain . ”
34486	34497	34483	34483	She	937	“ But you have Steve ’s ear too , right ? ”
34501	34507	34483	34483	She	937	“ We are n’t dating . ”
34508	34516	34517	34517	I	0	“ Really ? Everyone says you are . ”
34530	34546	34547	34547	I	0	“ We ’re not . Just friends for now . Maybe more in the future . ”
34550	34556	34557	34557	I	0	“ I ’m this way . ”
34574	34584	34563	34563	she	937	“ You want to do an Uber with me ? ”
34590	34595	34563	34563	she	937	“ I like the L. ”
34596	34608	34609	34609	She	937	“ Huh . Would n’t have ever guessed that about you . ”
34912	34917	34918	34918	I	0	“ Hi , Mom , ”
34927	34940	34921	34921	my	0	“ Oh , do n’t jump right into the sarcasm , Victory . ”
34941	34957	34958	34958	I	0	“ I ’m not . I ’m happy to answer when a warning is attached . ”
35002	35010	34921	34921	my	0	“ Are you on your way home ? ”
35011	35014	35080	35080	Her	963	“ Yes . ”

35024	35030	35031	35031	She	963	“ I have no idea . ”
35038	35044	35045	35045	I	0	“ Is that the L ? ”
35048	35056	35045	35045	I	0	“ Why are you calling , Mom ? ”
35057	35079	35080	35080	Her	963	“ So , you ’re on the train ? You have a compromised immune system and you ’re using public transportation ? ”
35085	35100	35080	35080	Her	963	“ Do you know how worried we are about you living in that city ? ”
35101	35114	35045	35045	I	0	“ Mom , I ca n’t keep having this conversation with you . ”
35115	35126	35127	35127	Her	963	“ She says she ca n’t keep having this conversation . ”
35145	35163	35134	35135	my father	250	“ Well , I do n’t want to have this conversation over and over either , Vick . ”
35171	35192	35164	35164	I	0	“ Then , let ’s not have it . I ’m fine and I had a long day at work . ”
35193	35196	35199	35200	my mother	266	“ Work . ”
35217	35234	35204	35204	she	266	“ How is work , honey ? I am so happy you are working with Steven . ”
35307	35318	35297	35298	my mother	266	“ Yes , Steven is a great boss and friend . ”
35319	35338	35339	35340	my mother	266	“ Is n’t he ? And Darcy called me today to tell me they sold to Stonewood Enterprises , ”
35352	35385	35343	35344	The Stonewoods	59	“ I ca n’t believe you know them , that Brey married Jax . Who did Samson and Sons have the meeting with ? Was it Jax or Jett , the oldest ? ”
35440	35465	35427	35427	She	266	“ Yes , but I did n’t say much . I think he ’s always amicable because he knows I ’m Brey ’s friend . ”
35466	35481	35427	35427	She	266	“ Of course , of course . So , are you going straight home ? ”
35504	35514	35515	35515	She	266	“ You are on the L , Victory Blakely . ”
35522	35538	35515	35515	She	266	“ I used to ride it , and I know exactly the way it sounds . ”
35594	35601	35586	35586	I	0	“ Excuse me , excuse me , ”
35612	35626	35586	35586	I	0	“ So , then you know it ’s perfectly safe for most people . ”
35627	35634	35635	35635	I	0	“ You are n’t most people . ”
35669	35677	35586	35586	I	0	“ Mom , can we just not ? ”
35678	35692	35586	35586	I	0	“ I told you I would get you a driver or a car . ”

35715	35726	35727	35727	I	0	“ I ca n’t talk . I have to go . ”
35973	36000	35959	35959	her	266	“ Now , these will help . But you have to will it , Vick . It takes the right mentality , besides diet and lifestyle . ”
36008	36015	36001	36002	My mom	252	“ We ’re taking every precaution . ”
36186	36203	36204	36204	She	1010	“ These nails have just never been pretty without a work of art from you professionals . ”
36212	36221	36204	36204	She	1010	“ We ’ll clean them up , huh ? ”
36544	36552	36553	36553	she	266	“ We ’ll beat it , sweetie , ”
36595	36601	36602	36602	I	0	“ It ’ll be okay . ”
36605	36612	36602	36602	I	0	“ We ’ll get through it . ”
37611	37631	37632	37632	He	67	“ Happy to have absorbed your company , Stevie . It ’ll be great having you work for us . ”
37639	37650	37632	37632	He	67	“ Absolutely . I think the acquisition will go through — ”
37651	37710	37711	37711	Gloria	96	“ It ’s already done , but the rest of your company will move here next month . That said , I have the people I want here now . We ’ll be moving each of you to departments of need as Gloria said . Today , we have more onboarding that is personalized to your job descriptions . ”
37722	37808	37711	37711	Gloria	96	“ My people will get everyone up to speed and show them to their departments . Most of you wo n’t be in this office . I have a very small team operating in here , personnel I need direct access to at all times . Every office throughout this building is a part of our family though . Remember that you ’re one of us now . Welcome aboard Stonewood Enterprises , where the sky ’s the limit for some , but not us . ”

38127	38133	38134	38134	Gloria	96	“ I ’m not mistaken , ”
38137	38144	38150	38150	she	51	“ Your desk is this way . ”

38266	38279	38263	38263	He	250	“ I could have been patching you on an important conference call . ”
38280	38293	38294	38295	My dad	258	“ And they all would have appreciated the father - son camaraderie . ”
38303	38316	38317	38317	I	0	“ More like they would n’t have said shit to a Stonewood . ”
38322	38328	38317	38317	I	0	“ What do you need ? ”
38329	38339	38340	38340	I	0	“ We have signatures from the Armanelli family still ? ”

38503	38535	38418	38418	His	1105	“ You keep up , I ’ll give you that , old man . You do n’t want to though . Your heart ’s not in it . Mine still is . ”
38536	38569	38607	38607	his	258	“ Your heart was always in it . It ’s a damn watch ticking to the beat of work . I ’m not sure anything will ever jam up those cogs either . ”
38570	38585	38607	38607	his	258	“ Nothing will . Except potentially the Armanellis trying to take a bigger cut . ”
38586	38589	38598	38598	he	258	“ Bah . ”
38639	38646	38629	38629	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
38647	38658	38672	38672	he	250	“ You called specifically for me to worry about it . ”
38675	38689	38672	38672	he	250	“ Maybe . Maybe I am getting a little tired of it all . ”
38717	38745	38710	38710	his	65	“ It ’s fall , Dad . Mom ’s been emotional because of the wedding . It ’s a lot . Take a few days , huh ? ”
38746	38757	38710	38710	his	65	“ What if a few days is all I got ? ”
38758	38764	38710	38710	his	65	“ Dad , come on . ”
38765	38786	38787	38787	I	0	“ I ’m thinking I might agree with you after all this time and now you want to fight me ? ”
38792	38824	38787	38787	I	0	“ Well , you not having your head in the game and half - assing it is still better than most people ’s full - assing . The company needs you . ”
38825	38837	38710	38710	his	65	“ Not true . You and Jax handle things very well . ”
38838	38870	38787	38787	I	0	“ Jax is buried in algorithms half the time , and I ’m stuck in meeting after meeting . We need you driving the stocks , your connections , your presence . ”
38874	38884	38787	38787	I	0	“ I ’m thinking your mother needs me more . ”
38885	38896	38710	38710	his	65	“ Dad , come on . Not this bullshit again . ”
38897	38915	38710	38710	his	65	“ Love ’s bullshit to you , son , but without it you would n’t be here . ”
38916	38930	38787	38787	I	0	“ You seem to forget the aftermath . Mom and you used to — ”
38931	39016	38710	38710	his	65	“ I ’m aware our relationship damaged your outlook on love , Jett . Your mother reminds me of that more than anyone . But , make no mistake . What you witnessed between us was no aftermath . An interlude , sure . I ’ll even admit to a break . But we were never done . There ’s no such thing as an aftermath with us . She ’s the only person aside from you boys who I will always fight for . ”
39017	39039	39041	39041	he	1113	“ You did n’t fight very hard when the company was at stake and I came to run things with you . ”

39286	39353	39354	39354	I	0	“ You ’re giving up a multibillion - dollar company that you built from the ground up to run off into the sunset with the woman you think was your first love ? You two could barely stand one another ten years ago ! And that woman flies off the handle as much as you do . You ’re putting the company at risk for nothing . ”
39370	39379	39362	39362	I	0	“ Let ’s just back up a step . ”
39380	39423	39362	39362	I	0	“ I ’m not backing up at all , boy . This is me and your mom . We built this empire for you boys . Do n’t forget that she was just as much a part of it as I was . ”

39434	39442	39443	39443	he	1118	“ She kept this goddamn family afloat , ”
39446	39491	39443	39443	he	1118	“ She worked her ass off to raise you boys and did a damn good job . And she righted my ship so many times , I should give the company to her , not you . Do n’t make me question my decision . ”
39533	39545	39520	39520	I	0	“ I ’m not saying she ’s not a good mother — ”
39546	39557	39558	39558	I	0	“ You better not be saying anything of the sort . ”

39569	39618	39625	39625	he	1122	“ I ’m not going back . I ’m sick of the past where I do n’t have her , Jett . I ’m done . Start drawing up your crew . Get your goals together . You ’re captain . You better not sink my damn ship . ”
39833	39840	39844	39844	her	266	“ Oh no , Jett Stonewood , ”
39856	39865	39844	39844	her	266	“ You get your workaholic ass in here . ”

39924	39941	39916	39916	Her	266	“ If you two wanted a conversation , we could have continued it over the phone . ”
39942	39969	39878	39878	I	0	“ I wanted to see my son , not just hear his voice . I should n't have to come to the tower to do it . ”

39983	40002	40003	40003	She	266	“ You 're about to get busier . That mean you do n't have time for your mother ? ”
40029	40041	40042	40042	He	250	“ You could have told me you had me on speakerphone . ”

40189	40245	40181	40181	her	266	“ You need to pull back , Jett . Jax will be with Aubrey . Your dad and I are leaving . You ca n't take on the burden of managing this company alone . You have the most intelligent people working here . They know their products . Trust them . Trust our teams . ”
40246	40261	40262	40262	He	1145	“ Dad , you can tell her that 's the worst business advice ever . ”
40268	40285	40286	40286	Mom	66	“ I do n't think you need any advice . Just do as you normally would . ”
40292	40302	40286	40286	Mom	66	“ No . He needs a vacation , Joe . ”
40303	40319	40321	40321	he	1145	“ Honey , he ca n't take a vacation when I 'm about to resign . ”

40445	40450	40451	40451	she	252	“ ‘ Good ’ ? ”
40454	40469	40451	40451	she	252	“ You 're not married , you work fifteen hour days like your father — ”
40470	40496	40508	40508	she	252	“ I do n't drink . I do n't do drugs . I 'm successful . Forbes claimed I 'm one of the most successful — ”
40497	40504	40508	40508	she	252	“ Success would be a grandson , ”
40561	40579	40553	40553	he	250	“ Love and kids are n't in the cards for me . You have Jax for that . ”

41813	41824	41825	41825	His	101	“ Something I can answer for you , Mr. Stonewood ? ”
41834	41856	41825	41825	His	101	“ Mister ... ? You know what , never mind . Yes , pull up the Benson file if you can . ”
41880	41891	41866	41866	I	0	“ Ah . So , you see the loophole too . ”
41920	41949	41950	41950	He	101	“ The wording allows for it . Legally , you could argue they intentionally worded it that way , but it probably would n't hold up in court . ”
42011	42023	42024	42024	His	101	“ I see your point . How do we fix it ? ”
42062	42069	42049	42049	he	101	“ Could we remove that sentence ? ”
42070	42080	42085	42085	him	101	“ That leaves you liable if something goes wrong . ”
42093	42116	42085	42085	him	101	“ Let me know when Bob gets back . I need him to figure this out by the end of the day . ”
42117	42124	42125	42125	I	0	“ I ’m working on it . ”

42285	42296	42297	42297	Steven	67	“ Did n’t come back in the best mood either . ”
42300	42313	42297	42297	Steven	67	“ Let ’s do dinner after you finish that today , huh ? ”
42343	42361	42337	42337	I	0	“ That would be great . I ’ll have it by then . It ’s right there . ”

43308	43311	43312	43312	Jett	101	“ Pix , ”
43328	43336	43316	43316	he	101	“ Are you afraid of the dark ? ”
43337	43346	43347	43347	I	0	“ What the heck is wrong with you ? ”
43369	43378	43357	43357	I	0	“ You almost gave me a heart attack . ”
43379	43384	43385	43385	He	101	“ Oh , please . ”
43393	43412	43385	43385	He	101	“ What are you ? Twenty - four ? Everyone needs a kick of adrenaline now and then . ”
43413	43439	43440	43440	His	101	“ Twenty - five and I get my adrenaline rush doing things I want to do , not having someone frighten me in the dark . ”
43463	43472	43455	43455	he	101	“ What things normally get your adrenaline going ? ”
43566	43599	43556	43556	I	0	“ I do n’t have time to make small talk with you tonight . You do n’t have time , either , as it seems the electrical in Stonewood Tower is down . ”
43600	43603	43604	43604	He	101	“ Shame . ”
43638	43730	43631	43631	I	0	“ ‘ Shame ’ ? Not really , Jett . I do n’t think I would enjoy making small talk with my new boss , although it is n’t like we ’ve tried it . Instead , I ’m completely ignored throughout the day and given elementary tasks as if I do n’t have a college degree . Even though I got put in the damn all - star room where the sky ’s never the limit for anyone except me . I ’m limited to getting freaking coffee for Gloria . ”
43742	43754	43731	43731	His	101	“ If this job is n’t what you pictured it being … ”
43766	43800	43755	43755	I	0	“ I just do n’t see why I was put in this room . You could have put me anywhere . You have a whole legal team on the twenty - third floor . ”
43801	43811	43731	43731	His	101	“ Gloria normally assigns desk areas to new employees . ”
43812	43822	43755	43755	I	0	“ So , she wanted me in this room ? ”
43823	43826	43827	43827	He	101	“ Nope . ”
43836	43847	43827	43827	He	101	“ I put you where I wanted you , Victory . ”
43848	43854	43855	43855	I	0	“ I ’m useless here . ”
43861	43901	43855	43855	I	0	“ Bob ’s going to figure out the contract that I ca n’t change tomorrow , and I ’m going to go back to getting only Gloria coffee because Josie will freak if I get anyone else a beverage . ”
43902	43909	43827	43827	He	101	“ Bob already looked at it . ”
43910	43913	43914	43914	I	0	“ What ? ”
43920	43932	43914	43914	I	0	“ He does n’t know what to do with it either . ”
43941	43949	43933	43933	He	101	“ That ’s not what you said . ”
43950	43964	43965	43965	He	101	“ I know what I said . I did it to motivate you . ”
43975	43991	43965	43965	He	101	“ The Armanellis are going to be a bitch to get under the right contract . ”
43992	44003	44004	44004	My	0	“ That ’s the Armanelli contract ? It says Benson . ”
44018	44023	44009	44009	He	101	“ That ’s confidential . ”
44024	44038	43965	43965	He	101	“ Why was n’t I made aware when I was working on it ? ”
44039	44049	44050	44050	I	0	“ That ’s the meaning of confidential , Pix . ”
44070	44102	44065	44065	I	0	“ Legally , Stonewood Enterprises needs to make me aware of that . I have a right to know . I could hold you liable for putting my life in danger . ”
44103	44113	44114	44114	His	101	“ I ’m not putting your life in danger . ”
44119	44127	44114	44114	His	101	“ They ’re a freaking mob family , ”
44152	44157	44147	44147	He	101	“ That ’s debatable . ”
44158	44174	44144	44144	someone	210	“ If you ’re trying to get a written contract with them , that means — ”
44175	44197	44144	44144	someone	210	“ It means we get a written contract with them and protect Stonewood Enterprises from whatever they do outside of it . ”
44198	44209	44147	44147	He	101	“ Protect ? From what ? Are they killing people ? ”
44229	44249	44224	44224	I	0	“ You ’re being dramatic . I did n’t take you for so much drama when I met you . ”
44250	44266	44267	44267	I	0	“ When you met me , we were on a sunny beach with no stress , ”
44282	44292	44293	44293	He	1221	“ The Armanellis have n’t killed anyone in decades . ”
44302	44313	44314	44314	I	0	“ And that ’s supposed to make me feel better ? ”
44334	44348	44319	44319	I	0	“ You ’re a lunatic . I ’m not working on this contract . ”
44349	44361	44319	44319	I	0	“ You already started , and I need Stonewood Enterprises protected . ”
44362	44376	44377	44377	My	0	“ Well , with what is already written , it wo n’t be . ”
44389	44420	44377	44377	My	0	“ What are you thinking , Jett ? Even if I were to come up with perfect sentences , it does n’t mean anything . They ca n’t be trusted . ”
44421	44430	44319	44319	I	0	“ Cade and Bastian have always been trustworthy . ”
44431	44437	44319	44319	I	0	“ Then why the contract ? ”
44438	44466	44377	44377	My	0	“ Because their father and mine had an understanding . Without my father at the helm , we need to have something concrete , something in writing . ”
44467	44479	44480	44480	I	0	“ As if the law will stop someone in the mob . ”
44498	44511	44480	44480	I	0	“ You ’re wading into waters no business should be swimming through . ”
44512	44522	44377	44377	My	0	“ Coming from you , that ’s pretty epic . ”
44530	44539	44540	44540	I	0	“ Where ’s the silver lining , Pix ? ”
44550	44573	44540	44540	I	0	“ I get that my positivity is somewhat frustrating at times , Jett . I know I ’m a lot , okay ? ”
44694	44721	44681	44681	I	0	“ I never claimed to be anything different , Jett . But I ’m not stupid either . I like to avoid completely avoidable dangerous situations . ”
44722	44730	44897	44897	him	1225	“ Could have fooled me on vacation . ”
44731	44745	44897	44897	him	1225	“ Why ? Because I wanted to go on a hike or two ? ”
44746	44787	44681	44681	I	0	“ You went gallivanting around that island looking for ways to die . You always do . You talk about wanting to feel alive and now you ’re cowering in the damn corner without even trying to negotiate a contract . ”
44788	44794	44795	44795	I	0	“ This is n’t cowering , ”
44803	44818	44795	44795	I	0	“ Then you ’ll be at the meeting tomorrow when we discuss this further ? ”
44819	44822	44681	44681	I	0	“ Meeting ? ”
44823	44841	44681	44681	I	0	“ Yes . I invited the Armanellis here to see if we can come to a compromise . ”
44842	44857	44795	44795	I	0	“ Jett , should n’t we think about what this means for the company ? "
44858	44880	44681	44681	I	0	“ Bob can come if you do n’t want to . Jax and Brey will be at the meeting as well . ”
44899	44916	44892	44892	I	0	“ Send the invite to my Outlook . I ’ll make sure my schedule is clear . ”
44917	44942	44795	44795	I	0	“ Fantastic . Now , since that ’s out of the way , are we fucking in my office or here at your desk ? ”
44943	44948	44892	44892	I	0	“ Are you insane ? ”

45023	45028	45008	45008	I	0	“ You like it ? ”
45029	45039	45079	45079	his	1225	“ It ’s distracting , that ’s for sure . ”

45047	45076	45077	45077	I	0	“ If you ’re searching for a compliment , Pix , call Stevie later and ask him . I want to fuck you , not fluff your ego . ”
45101	45110	45091	45091	he	1225	“ We should probably go home , Jett . ”
45138	45156	45157	45157	I	0	“ We ca n’t have sex in the office . There are probably cameras throughout this floor . ”
45184	45189	45190	45190	he	1225	“ You ’re right , ”
45194	45207	45190	45190	he	1225	“ That ’s why I turned off the power to this floor . ”
45328	45333	45334	45334	I	0	“ That ’s cocky . ”
45367	45380	45381	45381	I	0	“ Not cocky . Confident . Now , your desk or mine ? ”
45445	45449	45426	45426	He	1225	“ No preference ? ”
45485	45501	45502	45502	I	0	“ Oh , God . Just here . Let ’s do this here . Now . ”
45585	45593	45572	45572	He	1225	“ So , your desk it is . ”
45598	45617	45594	45594	I	0	“ I want it right here , Jett . You better devour me and leave me completely ravaged . ”
45645	45667	45638	45638	he	1225	“ Good . I want you to remember us here when you look up at Mr. Stevie across from you tomorrow . ”
45668	45675	45594	45594	I	0	“ You ’re such a dick . ”
45676	45686	45687	45687	I	0	“ The dick who ’s about to fuck you . ”
45723	45728	45729	45729	I	0	“ In that case , ”
45752	45771	45741	45741	I	0	“ Fuck me good because Steven went home , which means I ’m not getting any without you . ”
45779	45792	45772	45772	He	1225	“ You think he ’s going to get you off , woman ? ”
45793	45803	45804	45804	He	1225	“ Oh , he will . Just not tonight . ”

45836	45875	45807	45807	he	1225	“ Waiting for you to tell me this is your dream . Me and not him . I can see you practically concocting our future together . You and me in a nice house together or some shit . ”
45876	45886	45887	45887	I	0	“ Your realities rubbed off on me , Jett , ”

46552	46560	46544	46544	I	0	“ We keep pace , Mr. Stonewood . ”
46577	46595	46561	46561	I	0	“ You ’re still a goddamn knockout , Ms. Blakely . Even under my city ’s lights . ”
46642	46651	46639	46639	She	1241	“ Whatever . This will have to do . ”
46665	46674	46652	46652	She	1241	“ The SUV out front is for you . ”
46690	46698	46675	46675	She	1241	“ I do n’t need a ride . ”
46699	46706	46707	46707	She	1241	“ But you ’ll take one . ”
46713	46722	46707	46707	She	1241	“ Do we have to keep doing this ? ”
46723	46736	46675	46675	She	1241	“ Not if you just take the damn ride offered to you . ”
46737	46747	46675	46675	She	1241	“ Would you offer anyone else a ride home ? ”
46748	46765	46766	46766	Her	1241	“ Yes . I ’d offer everyone a ride home if they were here this late . ”
46780	46790	46778	46778	me	0	“ I ’m too tired to argue with you . ”
46791	46812	46813	46813	She	1241	“ Then do as I say . We ’ll get to that point eventually anyway . This way is faster . ”
46821	46824	46825	46825	She	1241	“ Fine . ”
46843	46853	46831	46831	she	1241	“ See you at the meeting tomorrow , boss . ”
46854	46876	46901	46901	she	1241	“ Yeah , do me a favor and do n’t dress like a damn present that ’s begging to be unwrapped . ”
46888	46895	46882	46882	she	1241	“ This outfit is completely professional . ”
47019	47040	47008	47008	I	0	“ That bow under your tits makes men think you want them to rip that dress open . I promise . ”
47041	47062	47073	47073	Her	1241	“ You ’re deranged . You are n’t thinking straight . Probably because you work too much . Go home . ”
47063	47072	47073	47073	Her	1241	“ You go home and take the ride . ”
47084	47090	47073	47073	Her	1241	“ Good night , Jett . ”

47667	47674	47661	47661	he	109	“ You ’re smiling , son . ”
47712	47720	47710	47710	him	109	“ So what if I ’m smiling ? ”
47721	47738	47739	47739	I	0	“ You never appear happy when we discuss the Armanellis . Not like that , anyway . ”
47744	47753	47739	47739	I	0	“ I do n’t know what you mean . ”
47780	47786	47765	47765	His	109	“ Ah . I see . ”

47813	47831	47798	47798	He	109	“ She ’s whip smart and a beacon of light . I ’m enjoying working with her . ”
47832	47855	47765	47765	His	109	“ She ’s naive , Bob . We both know it . Not everything is sugar plums and lollipops like she thinks . ”
47856	47877	47878	47878	I	0	“ Sure , but is n’t it nice to have someone around every now and then who thinks it is ? ”
47969	47989	47990	47990	Bob	109	“ It ’d be nice , Bob , if everyone worked so we ’re prepared for the Armanelli meeting . ”
48001	48009	47990	47990	Bob	109	“ We ’ll be fine , Jett . ”
48020	48029	48010	48010	I	0	“ Get back to work , old man . ”
48030	48047	48048	48048	He	109	“ Like you say , I ’m old . I ’ve got to take my time . ”
48059	48077	48048	48048	He	109	“ You just ran a damn marathon , Bob . Get the hell out of my office . ”
48111	48122	48123	48123	I	0	“ Get some sleep , son . You ’re cranky . ”
48269	48277	48266	48266	I	0	“ They ’ll just want to talk . ”
48281	48302	48266	48266	I	0	“ I agree . I made the PowerPoints in case , but I do n’t believe you ’ll need them . ”
48303	48328	48329	48329	Brey	56	“ Not sure it was worth the time . Your PowerPoints are burned into our brains . We ’ll know the stats if needed . ”
48356	48365	48366	48366	Vick	51	“ Brey , your PowerPoints were on point , ”
48378	48390	48370	48370	Bob	109	“ I agree . They really helped me understand the data . ”
48391	48397	48398	48398	Jax	60	“ Good job , Peaches , ”
48439	48455	48456	48456	Bob	109	“ Babe , everyone knows we ’re married . I can call you Peaches here . ”
48482	48494	48495	48495	Brey	56	“ Let ’s focus on preparing for the meeting , Jax , ”
48499	48502	48495	48495	Brey	56	“ Sure . ”
48515	48538	48539	48539	Brey	56	“ Anyone have any questions for Mrs. Stonewood ? She made the PowerPoints earlier this week at home . In my bed . ”
48564	48570	48561	48561	her	51	“ I have a question . ”
48574	48581	48571	48571	Bob	109	“ This ought to be good . ”
48582	48597	48604	48604	her	51	“ I ’m just wondering if Mrs. Stonewood created the PowerPoints before or after — ”
48598	48601	48602	48602	I	0	“ Victory , ”
48681	48693	48694	48694	Caden	119	“ I do n’t think we need to finish that sentence . ”
48703	48716	48717	48717	Sebastian	120	“ Oh , I would love for Victory to finish her sentence , ”
48732	48762	48763	48763	He	120	“ Victory , seems you ’ve made Jett Stonewood a little perturbed . I heard your name through the door . Tell me , was the sentence that bad ? ”
48803	48809	48793	48793	She	96	“ I ’m never bad . ”
48928	48964	48920	48921	my mother	266	“ My daughter is seventeen and at the top of her class . Where she will stay . Because she ’s a Blakely . I did n’t raise a daughter who could n’t handle it . ”
49054	49111	49038	49038	her	266	“ You almost died , Victory . You ca n’t risk catching something and not being close to home . You have a compromised immune system . Your father and I ca n’t lose you . Not after we almost lost you before . Stay close , honey . You can live a great life here . ”
49274	49284	49256	49256	Cade	112	“ Just a joke between colleagues , Mr. Armanelli . ”
49314	49328	49329	49329	he	88	“ Vick , you partied with me and that little dancer over there , ”
49337	49357	49332	49332	Brey	56	“ One of the best nights I had in a long time . Do n’t revert to professionalism now . ”
49640	49650	49651	49651	He	1323	“ So , it seems you ’ve all met . ”
49679	49688	49676	49676	Bastian	88	“ Seems the Stonewood men keep marvelous company . ”
49737	49744	49720	49720	Jett	51	“ Your father is n’t here . ”
49756	49783	49720	49720	Jett	51	“ He wanted to be here but thought since your father stepped down , it was best for us to handle it . Sons to sons . ”
49784	49827	49828	49828	Cade	112	“ This is n’t a family reunion , Cade . I do n’t sit at the kid table while the adults talk business . It is n’t son to son . It ’s owner to owner . You own the business now ? ”
49953	49967	49968	49968	Bastian	88	“ I took over the city if that ’s what you ’re asking . ”
50003	50006	49996	49996	Jett	51	“ When ? ”
50015	50027	50007	50007	Bastian	88	“ Dear old dad handed it over right before this meeting . ”
50061	50076	50057	50057	Jett	51	“ Well , then . Let ’s me and you talk business , Sebastian . ”
50077	50096	50120	50120	Bastian	88	“ Our contract stays the same . We do n’t have time to negotiate a change in terms . ”
50097	50109	50057	50057	Jett	51	“ That contract was outdated the day our fathers shook hands . ”
50110	50119	50120	50120	Bastian	88	“ There ’s no record of that handshake , ”
50123	50132	50120	50120	Bastian	88	“ I do n’t have time for this , ”
50149	50186	50187	50187	He	88	“ You know I ’m trying to develop a way of maintaining a clean water supply in third world countries . It ’s time sensitive for people who live there . This is n’t as important . ”
50292	50304	50305	50305	Bastian	88	“ I ’m here to keep working with you , Jett , ”
50326	50345	50318	50318	Jett	51	“ We ’re all here for that . Let ’s make it work . What do you need ? ”
50346	50357	50308	50308	his	88	“ I need backing on the pharmaceutical company , Levvetor . ”
50376	50385	50386	50386	Jett	51	“ Not even on the table , Bastian , ”
50390	50411	50386	50386	Jett	51	“ You did n’t send any information on that . It ’s a curveball I ’m not willing to entertain . ”
50444	50450	50451	50451	I	0	“ We should do it , ”
50554	50559	50560	50560	Jett	51	" She 's new , "
50568	50578	50560	50560	Jett	51	" She 's also intelligent . Hear her out . "
50598	50606	50610	50610	he	88	" Anything for you , little dancer , "
50658	50665	50666	50666	Jax	60	“ Drop the name , Bastian , "
50674	50682	50671	50671	his	60	" Let 's keep this about business . "
50687	50720	50685	50685	him	60	“ Investing in Levvetor would not only benefit the company from a publicity standpoint , it 's also a good company . And if that solidifies the contract we want with you … "
50771	50784	50749	50749	he	60	“ I think it ’s a deal we should n’t pass up . ”
50954	50964	50949	50949	He	60	“ Anyone else think it ’s a good idea ? ”
50965	50977	50978	50978	Jax	60	“ We need to do some research but it could work , ”
51020	51056	51057	51057	Jett	51	“ Levvetor Pharmaceuticals has outsold competitors for two quarters now . They ’re gaining attention and relevance as they are pricing their drugs higher than competitors and still selling . It ’s a solid investment . ”
51110	51118	51119	51119	he	1369	“ I ’m not interested , Gloria , ”
51194	51208	51151	51151	he	1369	“ Jett , we must already be watching them with those numbers and — ”
51209	51249	51296	51296	he	1369	“ Whether we are or are n’t watching them , Ms. Blakely , has nothing to do with this meeting . We are n’t backing a company that was n’t even on the table to pacify you , Sebastian . ”
51250	51258	51259	51259	He	1369	“ Then the contract stands as is . ”
51375	51387	51364	51364	I	0	“ What exactly do you want invested in Levvetor , Bastian ? ”
51398	51428	51388	51388	He	1369	“ Without Stonewood Enterprises , I can only invest sixty percent of what I ’d like . It would give me a share but not the voting share needed . ”
51445	51452	51429	51429	I	0	“ If I had another investor … ”
51453	51458	51495	51495	His	1380	“ They want Stonewood . ”
51459	51470	51495	51495	His	1380	“ I ’ll call Harvey . He ’ll consider it . ”
51471	51488	51489	51489	Jett	51	“ You ’ll call Harvey ? You have a direct line to the CEO of Levvetor ? ”
51570	51582	51558	51558	I	0	“ Yes , as I said , I ’ll call him . ”
51597	51617	51591	51591	he	88	“ Well then . You and I have business to discuss . Everyone else can go back to work . ”
51654	51679	51680	51680	His	1380	“ We do n’t make deals without my business involved , Victory . There ’s a reason we ’re in Stonewood Tower right now . ”
51707	51716	51717	51717	My	0	“ You do n’t want your business involved . ”
51738	51760	51724	51724	I	0	“ I think helping a company even if we ca n’t invest in them would be the best thing for everyone . ”
51761	51773	51774	51774	He	1380	“ So , now the Armanellis are a company to you ? ”
51787	51803	51774	51774	He	1380	“ I do n’t have time for you or this . The meeting is over . ”
51817	51828	51806	51806	his	88	“ I ’d like a word with Ms. Blakely alone . ”
51879	51883	51873	51873	she	56	“ Good luck . ”
51919	51925	51911	51911	He	101	“ Victory works for me . ”
51926	51944	51893	51893	He	101	“ She does , but the business we have together is n’t a part of Stonewood Enterprises . ”
51945	51959	51911	51911	He	101	“ Then you can have dinner with her outside of her working hours . ”
51960	51977	51911	51911	He	101	“ Do n’t be a prick , Jett . I just need a minute with her . ”
51997	52036	51992	51992	his	88	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake , I ’m not trying to date her or get her into business with me . She ’s safe , she ’s yours , she ’s untouchable . I get it . ”
52037	52042	52043	52043	I	0	“ I ’m what ? ”
52047	52056	52043	52043	I	0	“ I ’m not ... We ’re not … ”
52057	52066	52072	52072	he	101	“ Do n’t fucking forget it , Bastian . ”
52085	52088	52080	52080	Bastian	88	“ Jesus . ”
52139	52157	52158	52158	I	0	“ I do n’t want to hurt or scare you , Vick . It ’s just me . ”
52212	52245	52197	52197	He	88	“ You danced with me a whole damn night , woman . And now I ’m dating your friend . Katie is n’t scared of me . You should n’t be either . ”
52246	52254	52197	52197	He	88	“ Katie is n’t scared of anybody . ”
52266	52279	52262	52262	he	88	“ Got that right . I ’m fucking scared of her sometimes . ”
52398	52408	52471	52471	he	88	“ Everyone should fear you . Power breeds fear . ”
52409	52419	52471	52471	he	88	“ I do n’t have power like you think . ”
52420	52426	52427	52427	He	88	“ Do n’t you though ? ”
52433	52469	52471	52471	he	88	“ It 's a beautiful city . I ’m not here to paint it red . My dad gave me power because he wants me to clean up the red that ’s already been spilled . ”
52497	52516	52517	52517	I	0	“ Look , I do n’t want to be involved in this thing between you and the Stonewoods . ”
52520	52555	52517	52517	I	0	“ Levvetor is a good company . Does that mean you should back it ? I ’m not sure . I do n’t know if you are looking to corrupt it or help it . ”

52562	52579	52517	52517	I	0	“ I do n’t know how much weight that holds . A promise between us is — ”
52580	52602	52603	52603	I	0	“ Cross my heart , I ’ll bleed out on the streets of Chicago for you if you find me lying . ”
52662	52666	52634	52634	He	1400	“ Why Levvetor ? ”
52667	52688	52634	52634	He	1400	“ I could ask you the same question . Going up against Jett is n’t for the faint of heart . ”
52689	52692	52693	52693	I	0	“ Meh … ”
52701	52710	52698	52698	He	1400	“ More to that story , I see . ”
52711	52724	52725	52725	I	0	“ You do n’t see because there is n’t anything to see , ”
52728	52746	52725	52725	I	0	“ If you were just working under him , you would n’t have gone up against him . ”
52747	52754	52755	52755	I	0	“ Yes , I would have , ”
52763	52769	52770	52770	He	1400	“ I believe in Levvetor . ”
52786	52789	52778	52778	I	0	“ Why ? ”
52790	52794	52795	52795	I	0	“ You first , ”
52880	52910	52877	52877	He	1400	“ Aside from the fact that it will make us all a lot of money , my father knows the founder . They are good friends of the family . ”
52919	52963	52916	52916	he	1400	“ And yes , I mean that in every sense of the word . We do n’t want competitors shutting them down , and that means we need to pour more money into it when the government starts to back the bigger companies . ”
52964	52975	52916	52916	he	1400	“ Their drugs are working . The government ca n’t … ”
52976	52998	52916	52916	he	1400	“ Big companies can make smaller ones go away even if they are finding cures , Vick . You know that . ”
52999	53023	52916	52916	he	1400	“ Okay . So , if Stonewood Enterprises wo n’t back you , then I ’ll lean hard on my mother ’s company . ”
53024	53047	53048	53048	He	1406	“ Blakely Fashion ? Interesting . You ’ll be tanking your career at Stonewood Enterprises and doing something completely illegal . And ... ”
53061	53069	53048	53048	He	1406	“ You do n’t care one bit . ”
53070	53073	53074	53074	I	0	“ Nope . ”
53086	53092	53074	53074	I	0	“ I need an explanation . ”
53093	53104	53105	53105	I	0	“ Ca n’t me wanting to save lives be enough ? ”
53111	53114	53105	53105	I	0	“ Nope . ”
53138	53143	53128	53128	his	1406	“ Tell me why . ”

53265	53270	53271	53271	He	1406	“ You do n’t … ”
53274	53285	53271	53271	He	1406	“ You are n’t sick . You do n’t look … ”
53286	53297	53298	53298	His	1406	“ I ’m in remission . Have been for years . ”

53415	53423	53424	53424	I	0	“ It does n’t go over well , ”
53427	53438	53424	53424	I	0	“ That ’s a lot of baggage for one person . ”
53439	53454	53455	53455	Bastian	88	“ I ’m sure you have a lot of baggage for one person too . ”
53480	53491	53492	53492	He	88	“ We follow your lead when it comes to Levvetor . ”
53502	53507	53508	53508	He	88	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
53519	53525	53508	53508	He	88	“ We need your expertise . ”
53599	53607	53592	53592	He	88	“ I ’ll do whatever I can . ”
53608	53630	53631	53631	He	88	“ Get Jett to back it . I do n’t want your mother ’s company involved . Government can get dicey . ”
53637	53649	53633	53633	his	88	“ Mean . Stonewood Enterprises has the manpower to handle mean . ”
53650	53656	53633	53633	his	88	“ My mother ’s company … ”
53657	53668	53669	53669	He	88	“ Does n’t know what mean really is , Vick . ”
53699	53712	53713	53713	He	88	“ And you think I do ? That I can handle this ? ”
53739	53745	53727	53727	His	88	“ You ’re a fighter . ”
53751	53757	53727	53727	His	88	“ Damn right I am . ”
54361	54376	54356	54356	I	0	“ What the fuck do I need to know about Levvetor and the Armanellis ? ”
54377	54381	54382	54383	my mother	266	“ Jett Stonewood , ”
54386	54403	54382	54383	my mother	266	“ You ’re on speaker and if you think I raised you to speak that way — ”
54404	54415	54416	54416	He	258	“ Dad , why do you have me on speaker ? ”
54419	54432	54416	54416	He	258	“ We ’re in the car , and she ’s your mother . ”
54433	54443	54382	54383	my mother	266	“ She ’s an enforcer is what she is . ”
54444	54452	54453	54453	she	266	“ Watch your mouth , young man , ”
54461	54481	54482	54482	He	258	“ Love you , Mom . Dad , I really need to know what I ’m dealing with here . ”
54485	54497	54482	54482	He	258	“ I ’m trying to enjoy my time with your mother . ”
54498	54514	54537	54537	Vick	51	“ And I ’m trying to not go into the lion ’s den completely blind . ”
54529	54536	54537	54537	Vick	51	“ Avoid it if you can . ”
54565	54572	54555	54555	I	0	“ And if I ca n’t ? ”
54573	54580	54581	54581	I	0	“ Do n’t go in blind . ”
54616	54620	54621	54621	I	0	“ Screw it , ”
54635	54648	54624	54624	I	0	“ You want to discuss the meeting here or in my office ? ”
54686	54697	54684	54684	hers	51	“ Bob and I are working on another contract that — ”
54698	54703	54744	54744	his	67	“ That can wait . ”
54704	54712	54713	54713	she	51	“ I do n’t think it can , ”
54737	54740	54741	54741	Stevie	67	“ Vicky , ”
54793	54808	54782	54782	her	51	“ I ’m sorry . Yes , we should discuss it in your office . ”
54911	54921	54903	54903	she	51	“ Why are you rolling your eyes , Vick ? ”
54922	54927	54905	54905	her	51	“ I ’m not . ”
54928	54943	54905	54905	her	51	“ Cut the shit . Time is money around here , you know that . ”
54944	54958	54959	54959	I	0	“ Okay . Then we probably should n’t focus on my eye rolling . ”
54989	54997	54970	54970	She	51	“ Levvetor needs you to back them . ”
54998	55003	55004	55004	I	0	“ Oh , really ? ”
55015	55046	55004	55004	I	0	“ What about you finding Bastian a different company ? I ’m pretty sure an employee offering to hook a client up with a competitor is n’t in our handbook . ”
55047	55074	55075	55075	I	0	“ You have every right to fire me , and I ’m happy to resign if you feel I need to after my display in there . ”
55092	55101	55088	55088	she	1456	“ I do n’t care about my job . ”
55110	55172	55105	55105	I	0	“ Of course , I want to keep working for your company . It ’s Stonewood Enterprises where la - di - da the sky ’s not the limit . Although I must say , today , in that room , it seemed like your standpoint was the limit and no one wanted to overstep it or share a damn idea . ”
55206	55241	55202	55202	she	1456	“ Either way , yes , I want to keep my job , but I ’m happy to step down and move on if you want . I just want you to reconsider Levvetor . ”
55242	55257	55258	55258	She	1456	“ I wo n’t ask why . You know you need to explain yourself . ”
55269	55369	55258	55258	She	1456	“ A couple of years ago , the government tried to shut them down . Now , of course , no one ever came out and actually said that , but the FDA released a statement after a meeting they had with one of Levvetor ’s biggest competitors . Levvetor appealed , lost millions , and just barely scraped by . I followed the news of it all very closely . Coincidently , I was doing a thesis on the company at the time . Their drugs work , Jett . They are saving lives at an extraordinary rate . ”
55370	55377	55378	55378	I	0	“ So do other pharmaceutical companies , ”
55407	55467	55397	55397	I	0	“ Yes . At extremely expensive rates and by monopolizing the market half the time and sometimes to the detriment of their customers ’ health . That competitor has a higher death rate with more side effects than Levvetor ever had and they know it . That ’s why they tried everything in their power to shut them down . ”
55468	55474	55390	55393	the devil ’s advocate	1459	“ And they will again . ”
55475	55499	55390	55393	the devil ’s advocate	1459	“ Yes , they will again . And without you backing them , they ’ll win . You and I both know it . ”
55500	55509	55397	55397	I	0	“ This happens all the time , Vick . ”
55510	55520	55390	55393	the devil ’s advocate	1459	“ But maybe this time we can stop it . ”
55521	55534	55390	55393	the devil ’s advocate	1459	“ I need you to be realistic at some point , Victory . ”
55535	55577	55397	55397	I	0	“ And I need you to disappear into my damn dream world for a second , Jett , and take a chance . Shoot for past the sky . Get into the damn stratosphere with me and save some lives here . ”
55578	55599	55397	55397	I	0	“ You were warning me about that mobster last night and now you want to get in bed with him . ”
55600	55609	55390	55393	the devil ’s advocate	1459	“ It ’ll be strictly business with them . ”
55610	55616	55397	55397	I	0	“ You sure about that ? ”
55652	55687	55641	55641	She	1460	“ Of course . Steven asked me to dinner tonight , and I ’m … well , you know I ’m committed to that . I ’m not getting into bed with the mob . ”
55688	55694	55643	55643	her	1460	“ Committed to what exactly ? ”
55706	55714	55700	55700	I	0	“ I want a relationship , Jett . ”
55715	55725	55726	55726	My	0	“ Oh , and Stevie will give you one . ”
55731	55745	55726	55726	My	0	“ He ’ll also keep you nicely packed in a Stepford wife box . ”
55746	55754	55755	55755	I	0	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
55764	55767	55755	55755	I	0	“ Vicky . ”
55782	55820	55768	55768	She	1461	“ This is irrelevant . Back to the meeting , please ? Levvetor needs us , and Bastian does n’t think it is a good idea to have any company other than Stonewood Enterprises invested in them . ”
55821	55842	55755	55755	I	0	“ Then , he should have put it on the table for me to take into account before the meeting . ”
55843	55854	55768	55768	She	1461	“ So , you ’re saying no based on principle ? ”
55855	55865	55768	55768	She	1461	“ It ’s a matter of respect , Vick . ”
55866	55896	55755	55755	I	0	“ Levvetor is saving lives . Has it occurred to you that maybe lives are a little more important than you getting respect ? Can we focus on that ? ”
55897	55906	55907	55907	She	1461	“ I focus on that every single day . ”
55940	55954	55936	55938	that infuriating woman	1463	“ Have you noticed the work we do , what we stand for ? ”
55955	55958	55959	55959	Her	1461	“ Jett . ”
55965	55973	55959	55959	Her	1461	“ I know you do a lot … ”
55974	56041	55936	55938	that infuriating woman	1463	“ I do n’t need reassurance , Victory . Or praise , for that matter . I need you to see the bigger picture . If I fold to a man like that without him giving me respect , my company will fold a lot faster for a lot less . We ca n’t afford that . The city I work for ca n’t afford that . ”
56042	56050	56051	56051	she	1461	“ The world ca n’t afford that , ”
56070	56114	56056	56056	She	1461	“ I see you scooping up wounded passengers and putting them on your overloaded boat to carry them to shore . You 're their captain , Jett . And you spend every hour of your day making sure everyone has a life vest . ”
56134	56223	56131	56131	She	1461	“ I ’m ecstatic to be a part of that . And I know Bastian is asking for one more passenger on a boat that could sink at any moment because it 's beyond capacity . Everyone here works extremely hard . I know everyone enjoys it , but you have to trust them to be able to handle more . The boat can take on more than you think . They are the best of the best , after all . And then reward them for it . ”
56224	56230	56231	56231	I	0	“ I do reward them , ”
56238	56244	56234	56234	She	1461	“ Really ? With what ? ”
56245	56257	56258	56258	She	1461	“ Money . A good salary . A very good salary . ”
56267	56323	56258	56258	She	1461	“ True . But sometimes people like to have a little fun . They want to feel a part of the family . The Stonewood name shines bright , Jett , and I bet if you give your people a little release , they will come back rejuvenated and ready to kick even more ass . ”
56324	56330	56387	56387	she	1461	“ They ’re rejuvenated now . ”
56331	56371	56372	56372	My	0	“ We ’ve all been working extra - long hours since your father stepped down , and not one person is going to complain , partially because they ’re scared to but also because no one has the energy . ”
56432	56435	56425	56425	My	0	“ Fine . ”
56436	56441	56442	56442	Her	1461	“ Fine , what ? ”
56452	56516	56446	56446	I	0	“ You think my team needs something . Halloween is in a few days . Throw a party . The Monday after , I ’m holding a meeting to discuss Levvetor . If the team agrees it ’s something we want to take on , I ’ll do it . If they ’re hungover and nonresponsive , I win . You drop it . ”
56517	56520	56521	56521	Her	1461	“ Deal . ”
56526	56529	56530	56530	She	1461	“ And . ”
56540	56553	56533	56533	she	1461	“ You wear black every day for the rest of the year . ”
56554	56557	56533	56533	she	1461	“ Seriously ? ”
56558	56571	56533	56533	she	1461	“ Dead serious , Vick . Your colors are too damn bright . ”
56572	56577	56578	56578	she	1461	“ Oh my God , ”
56586	56611	56578	56578	she	1461	“ I have to plan an epic party . Please , for the love of all that is holy , loosen up before then . ”
56995	57002	57003	57003	I	0	“ Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
57037	57044	57028	57028	she	51	“ I ’m a little busy . ”
57045	57057	57074	57074	she	51	“ You were just texting . A little busy doing what ? ”
57092	57102	57103	57103	she	51	“ I told you I was on a date ! ”
57108	57132	57103	57103	she	51	“ Oh , like Stevie gives a shit . He ’d probably come if he knew you were on the phone with me . ”
57133	57139	57103	57103	she	51	“ What do you want ? ”
57140	57145	57103	57103	she	51	“ Where are you ? ”
57146	57149	57103	57103	she	51	“ Seriously ? ”
57150	57162	57103	57103	she	51	“ Yeah , you at dinner or at his place already ? ”
57163	57171	57103	57103	she	51	“ I ’m not a cheap date . ”
57172	57178	57103	57103	she	51	“ Could have fooled me . ”
57179	57195	57103	57103	she	51	“ We ’ve never been , nor will we ever go , on a date . ”
57196	57199	57200	57200	I	0	“ Fine , ”
57213	57235	57200	57200	I	0	“ I did n’t say you could book a haunted house for the party and offer a thousand - dollar prize . ”
57236	57246	57103	57103	she	51	“ I know . Your brothers said I could . ”
57247	57251	57103	57103	she	51	“ Those assholes — ”

58317	58361	58308	58309	my mother	266	“ You forget that my mother takes giving in as a weakness . If I answer , she ’ll assume her strategy was effective and ring me twelve times in a row the next time she wants to get a hold of me . ”

58399	58454	58393	58393	I	0	“ She ’s absolutely not that bad . We just do n’t see eye to eye on some things . You know she ’s extremely overprotective of me . She ’s obsessed with telling me I should n’t be living in the city . Do n’t you know how dangerous it is , Brey ? ”
58462	58477	58455	58455	She	56	“ I honestly wish I had parents who doted on me like yours do . ”
58542	58558	58535	58535	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , best friend . You can call my parents any time . ”

58601	58613	58614	58614	I	0	“ The part of what ? Tinker Bell in Peter Pan ? ”
58617	58643	58614	58614	I	0	“ No , do I look slutty enough to make all the boys look my way but professional enough to be at a work party ? ”
58647	58660	58644	58644	She	62	“ Yes to the first , not so much to the second . ”
58661	58679	58680	58680	I	0	“ Great ! Exactly what I ’m going for . Steven will die when he sees me , ”

58857	58871	58872	58872	She	62	“ So , it ’s just him being boring you do n’t like ? ”
58875	58906	58872	58872	She	62	“ You had to ask , did n’t you ? Honestly , I think I ’m starting to hate hearing him call you Vicky about as much as Katie does . ”
58907	58914	58915	58915	I	0	“ It is n’t that bad , ”
58934	58952	58953	58953	I	0	“ Not now . But imagine in a year or two , it might drive you nuts . ”
58967	58991	58953	58953	I	0	“ He ’s nice , and he wants to be married in a year or so . He told me on our date . ”
59005	59015	58994	58994	her	56	“ He told you that on your first date ? ”
59016	59031	58994	58994	her	56	“ To be fair , we ’ve known each other for years , Brey . ”
59032	59035	59036	59036	She	56	“ True . ”

59108	59137	59091	59091	she	56	“ Oh , you are wearing it . You will be jaw - dropping after I finish your makeup . We are going to win this costume contest . ”
59138	59142	59143	59143	She	56	“ You are . ”
59153	59171	59143	59143	She	56	“ Or Jett is going to drag you out of the party because of your inappropriate costume . ”
59172	59176	59091	59091	she	56	“ Drag me ? ”
59177	59180	59181	59181	She	56	“ Yup . ”

59211	59236	59181	59181	She	56	“ Oh , God . Please . That was a mistake that wo n’t be happening again . Nor do I want it to . ”
59252	59273	59245	59245	I	0	“ You do n’t have to hide it from me . I ’m married to one . I get it . ”

59366	59410	59426	59426	I	0	“ He and I go way back . We were able to just comfortably talk and enjoy each other at dinner . He loves working with me , and oh my God , he loves the Stonewoods . Double dates would be amazing . ”
59411	59425	59426	59426	I	0	“ Or kind of weird . He kind of sucks up to them . ”
59431	59454	59455	59455	She	1511	“ They ’re the Stonewoods . You do n’t get it , but I was a little starstruck at one point too . ”
59464	59486	59455	59455	She	1511	“ That might be true . It does n’t really matter if you like him and are comfortable with him though . ”
59498	59510	59487	59487	I	0	“ I ’m definitely more comfortable with him than Jett Stonewood . ”
59622	59629	59630	59630	I	0	“ Speak of the devil men … ”
59674	59679	59680	59680	he	60	“ Oh , no , ”

59777	59785	59771	59771	her	56	“ We think my outfit ’s cute . ”
59786	59808	59741	59741	He	60	“ Your outfit is a second skin , and that fine ass is mine . Not for anyone else ’s eyes . ”
59809	59818	59819	59819	Jaydon	58	“ It is a fine ass , Brey , ”
59838	59846	59847	59847	Jax	60	“ Avert your eyes , you asshole , ”
59853	59869	59847	59847	Jax	60	“ Oh , come on , man . You know I ’m joking with you . ”
59879	59884	59870	59870	He	60	“ Not really though . ”

59949	59993	59938	59938	I	0	“ We better get going . I do n’t want to miss the haunted house . It ’s supposed to be three floors of hell and then they bury you alive for ten minutes . People are going to freak the hell out . ”
59994	60008	60009	60009	Jax	60	“ We ’re going to stay here for a minute while Brey changes . ”
60019	60023	60024	60024	Brey	56	“ You stay , ”
60041	60053	60030	60030	she	56	“ I ’m going to see who does like my costume . ”
60179	60189	60175	60175	Brey	56	“ Probably should have worn something a bit warmer . ”
60252	60259	60246	60246	Jaydon	58	“ You ’ll freeze , Vick . ”
60266	60277	60260	60260	I	0	“ No can do . Purple clashes with my green . ”
60281	60292	60278	60278	Jaydon	58	“ So , take it off when we get inside . ”
60336	60339	60340	60340	he	58	“ Vick , ”
60350	60357	60343	60343	he	58	“ Put the damn thing on . ”

62585	62591	62592	62592	I	0	“ Maybe I should n’t . ”
62616	62624	62605	62605	I	0	“ Yes . Maybe you should n’t . ”
62625	62638	62592	62592	I	0	“ But they say it ’s a once in a lifetime feeling . ”

62779	62793	62794	62794	I	0	“ They opted out after their walk through , which is very common . ”

Then , we drop hollow plastic balls on you for a couple minutes . They are the same type of balls that can be found at Chuck E. Cheese ’s and Discovery Zone . After the allotted amount of time , the walls are shifted so the pressure will give your body the illusion of being buried alive . The experience is about ten minutes . ”

63455	63464	63449	63449	he	1588	“ Good enough distraction from being buried alive ? ”

64187	64196	64197	64197	I	0	“ We ’ll see you at the office , ”
64226	64233	64234	64234	she	96	“ You enjoy the haunted house ? ”
64249	64258	64234	64234	she	96	“ I ’m not enjoying any of this . ”
64259	64266	64267	64267	she	96	“ You are and you should , ”
64270	64282	64267	64267	she	96	“ Victory Blakely is n’t all she seems , you know . ”
64283	64294	64295	64295	Gloria	96	“ I do n’t know what you mean by that . ”
64359	64367	64355	64355	I	0	“ What are n’t you telling me ? ”
64368	64395	64355	64355	I	0	“ Something I will continue to not tell you . I ’m just saying the woman is more than a pop of color in your office . ”
64396	64431	64355	64355	I	0	“ I ’m not discrediting her intelligence and value , Gloria . Do I think she necessarily belongs on my team ? I ’m not sure yet . I know she has the credentials . ”
64432	64483	64484	64484	I	0	“ I vet every person on your team . Thoroughly . I ’m telling you , she ’s more than just credentials . She belongs here . The party is an unfortunate but perfect example . The team will do well next week after this burst of goodwill from you . ”
64491	64499	64484	64484	I	0	“ You think the party is working ? ”
64500	64530	64531	64531	I	0	“ It ’s genius . They ’ll have ideas for Levvetor after this . And quite honestly , we should have thought of the party in the first place . ”
64554	64600	64544	64544	Gloria	96	“ I ’m fighting for that deal . It ’s the right thing for our company to do . I ’m telling you now so you ’re fully prepared for it next week . I do n’t intend to hold myself or Ms. Blakely back . ”
64633	64651	64627	64627	I	0	“ You ’re one in a billion , Gloria . Remind me why we are n’t together . ”
64652	64713	64620	64620	She	1625	“ Because we fuck well but are n’t compatible . You and Ms. Blakely most likely are . Keep that in mind before you go pushing her away . You ’ll regret it in the end , and Steve will be more than willing to let her run into his arms as he begs for your approval over her shoulder . ”
64714	64738	64627	64627	I	0	“ So , I ’m not imagining that man ’s desire to be with her is only to get closer to us Stonewoods ? ”
64739	64753	64754	64754	I	0	“ I think Vick ’s the only one not able to see it . ”
64760	64783	64754	64754	I	0	“ She sees it . She just has her daydream glasses on to filter out the glare of his every annoying move . ”
64794	64817	64784	64784	Gloria	96	“ I suggest you dispose of those glasses of hers before she ends up in the wrong man ’s bed for good . ”
65130	65138	65122	65122	I	0	“ I love you as Peter Pan . ”
65239	65246	65225	65225	I	0	" You look fantastic , Vicky . "
65254	65276	65247	65247	His	67	" Jax , I have to wonder if Jett ’s fine with the ladies dressing like this for a work event ? "
65309	65326	65289	65289	himself	58	“ My brother should n’t be looking at my girl ’s outfit and neither should you . ”
65339	65346	65332	65332	Brey	56	“ No , I just meant … ”
65347	65356	65357	65357	Jaydon	58	“ Stop while you ’re ahead , bro , ”
65373	65380	65364	65364	I	0	“ Do n’t be a dick . ”
65390	65414	65415	65415	He	67	“ We ’re dressed to make jaws drop , Steven . You saw people at the haunted house . We ’re all fine . ”
65461	65478	65453	65453	Jaydon	58	“ Do n’t , Tinker . You look hot as hell , woman . Perk up . ”
65588	65595	65583	65583	Brey	56	“ That was awkward , right ? ”
65596	65600	65601	65601	I	0	“ So awkward , ”
65609	65621	65604	65604	Jax	60	“ Fuck me . This is still not a good idea . ”
65633	65647	65648	65648	Brey	56	“ Jax , we ’re in public . Try to have a filter , ”
65651	65658	65659	65659	he	60	“ Try to wear some clothes , ”
65711	65719	65720	65720	He	60	“ Do you want to go home ? ”
65726	65732	65720	65720	He	60	“ Yup . Good idea . ”
65733	65750	65751	65751	Jax	60	“ Great . Vick will make sure I get home safe when the party ’s over . ”
65759	65765	65751	65751	Jax	60	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
65766	65778	65720	65720	He	60	“ No . I ’m going to enjoy myself . If you can’t,”—she
65779	65785	65751	65751	Jax	60	shrugged—“I suggest you go home . ”
65786	65791	65792	65792	he	60	“ God damn it , ”
65812	65818	65797	65797	his	60	“ Love you , Peaches . ”
65851	65862	65845	65845	he	67	“ I ’m excited to see what you all planned . ”
65866	65874	65845	65845	he	67	“ This is all Vick ’s doing . ”
65875	65887	65888	65888	He	67	“ I ca n’t believe Jett agreed to this last minute . ”
65892	65899	65888	65888	He	67	“ We ’re all so busy . ”
65900	65911	65912	65912	I	0	“ Yep . That ’s why we need a break , ”
65915	65928	65912	65912	I	0	“ We work hard and so we should play hard when possible . ”
66039	66042	66043	66043	She	108	“ Brey ! ”
66049	66054	66055	66055	Brey	56	“ This is fantastic . ”
66058	66076	66055	66055	Brey	56	“ I honestly did n’t do much . Mostly this was the beautiful Tinker Bell , here . ”
66088	66106	66107	66107	She	108	“ Vick , you look hot as hell . And everyone ’s already having a great time . ”
66117	66134	66107	66107	She	108	“ Also , I ’m not supplying drinks . So , that ’s always a plus . ”
66185	66191	66169	66169	she	108	“ How are the drinks ? ”
66192	66196	66197	66197	Josie	108	“ So spooky ! ”

66430	66450	66402	66402	I	0	“ Do n’t downplay planning it on such short notice . You ’ve earned many people ’s respect here . ”
66549	66564	66536	66536	She	362	“ I ’m really looking forward to helping you close the deal with Levvetor . ”
66565	66573	66580	66580	she	362	“ I ’m sorry . You knew ? ”
66612	66642	66609	66609	she	362	“ I ’m aware of pretty much everything Jett does . His life is work and I am his right - hand man , the hand of the king . ”
66648	66651	66609	66609	she	362	“ Okay . ”
66664	66722	66660	66660	her	362	“ The party is a test . He ’ll say you failed , but he knows you passed . Also , I told him I ’m pushing that deal as hard as I can come next week . I ’m loaded and ready to go . We ’ll get Levvetor on our books . I promise you . ”
66768	66784	66763	66763	I	0	“ You wo n’t regret it . I promise you the company is saving lives . ”
66785	66791	66792	66792	Gloria	96	“ I did my research . ”
66801	66808	66812	66812	she	96	“ I ’ll see you Monday . ”
66821	66826	66827	66827	I	0	“ I might cry , ”
66832	66836	66837	66837	Brey	56	“ Me too , ”
66841	66872	66837	66837	Brey	56	“ She ’s amazing to work with . She ’s so reliable , you know ? But also sort of different . I just ... did n’t picture that happening . ”
66878	66884	66885	66885	She	1671	“ Whiskey sour , huh ? ”
66982	66990	66991	66991	I	0	“ You pulled off the costume perfectly , ”
67003	67034	66995	66995	He	109	“ I barely made it out the door looking like this , but all in good fun . My wife told me she ’s always had a thing for pirates . ”

67216	67243	67213	67213	I	0	“ I set your jacket down on the table back there . I did n’t have a chance to give it to you before you disappeared . ”
67253	67268	67244	67244	He	109	“ Surprised you noticed my departure . Stevie seemed to have all your attention . ”
67269	67277	67278	67278	I	0	“ And Gloria had all of yours , ”
67284	67308	67278	67278	I	0	“ Not that I care . I do n’t . I ca n’t and I wo n’t . Tonight is n’t about that . ”
67309	67322	67323	67323	Jett	51	“ You ’re right . It ’s about you proving a point . ”
67329	67353	67323	67323	Jett	51	“ You think you ’re doing a good enough job ? You think they ’ll come ready to work on Monday ? Rejuvenated ? ”
67354	67374	67278	67278	I	0	“ I have no doubt . Especially after you crown the costume queen or king with a thousand dollars . ”
67375	67389	67278	67278	I	0	“ I ’m guessing you do n’t want to announce my vote yourself ? ”
67390	67394	67395	67395	I	0	“ Absolutely not . ”
67405	67424	67425	67425	He	1682	“ I want to have everyone line up and show off their outfits to you one by one . ”
67428	67435	67436	67436	I	0	“ To music , of course , ”
67439	67447	67436	67436	I	0	“ No one wants to do that . ”

67461	67464	67465	67465	he	1682	“ Jesus , ”
67475	67482	67469	67469	his	1682	“ You went overboard , woman . ”
67483	67487	67469	67469	his	1682	“ Not possible . ”
67488	67518	67519	67519	I	0	“ Completely possible . Look at your outfit , Pix . It ’s a damn plant corset wrapped up in sparkle and glitter . Did you dye your hair ? ”
67538	67557	67519	67519	I	0	“ I figured if I lost and had to wear black , at least my hair would pop . ”
67558	67582	67521	67521	my	0	“ Jesus . No one went to the lengths you did for a damn costume . Ca n’t we just say you won ? ”
67625	67639	67617	67617	I	0	“ I ’m freaking happy and proud of my Tinker Bell , Jett . ”
67640	67653	67654	67654	I	0	“ And half the room is damn happy you wore it too . ”
67659	67663	67664	67664	He	1682	“ Which half ? ”
67672	67688	67664	67664	He	1682	“ You know it 's the male half . It ’s completely inappropriate for work . ”
67689	67692	67693	67693	I	0	“ Exactly ! ”
67700	67711	67693	67693	I	0	“ This is n’t work ! That ’s the point . ”
67712	67721	67664	67664	He	1682	“ You should have kept my jacket on . ”
67722	67739	67664	67664	He	1682	“ You ’re kidding , right ? Do you honestly care that much who ’s looking ? ”
67740	67757	67693	67693	I	0	“ More than I want to , Pix . A lot more than I want to . ”
67768	67784	67758	67758	I	0	“ I ’m not too happy about the way your date looks at you either . ”
67785	67799	67664	67664	He	1682	“ Ah , at least I get one honest response from you tonight . ”
67800	67806	67693	67693	I	0	“ I ’m always honest . ”
67807	67837	67838	67838	He	1682	“ You ’re always happy , Victory . Even when you ’re not . You never let the raw side of you breathe and it 's suffocating in there . ”
67849	67860	67838	67838	He	1682	“ Let ’s get this voting going , shall we ? ”
68033	68048	68027	68027	I	0	“ I think that ’s everyone . Let me go talk to the Phantom . ”
68061	68090	68051	68051	her	56	“ Oh , no . Ms. Blakely , you will do your walk in your outfit . You do not get to opt out just because you emceed . ”
68091	68092	68027	68027	I	0	“ Girl,”—I
68093	68099	68100	68100	She	56	whispered—“this is n’t for me . ”
68105	68127	68100	68100	She	56	“ I know . It ’s for Stonewood Enterprises . Look at them . They want to see you , Vick . ”
68325	68335	68322	68322	I	0	“ I just think of a happy little thing . ”
68336	68339	68340	68340	he	139	“ Pix , ”
68346	68355	68340	68340	he	139	“ It ’s the same as having wings . ”
68356	68375	68397	68397	he	139	“ Clip your wings , woman . Fall back to the ground where the rest of us are . ”
68376	68390	68391	68391	His	139	“ I do n’t need them , Jett . I can already fly . ”
68403	68408	68397	68397	he	139	“ Tinker Bell wins . ”
68413	68424	68410	68410	he	139	“ Monday , we come back from Neverland , Pix . ”
68437	68448	68425	68425	I	0	“ Not a chance , Phantom . We belong here . ”
68857	68860	68853	68853	I	0	“ Steven ? ”
68869	68872	68873	68873	I	0	“ Morning . ”
68878	68889	68873	68873	I	0	“ Yeah . Good morning . How are you feeling ? ”
68890	68900	68875	68875	my	0	“ Probably about as good as you ’re feeling . ”
68901	68904	68905	68905	I	0	“ Right . ”
68921	68946	68905	68905	I	0	“ I ’d love for us to get breakfast or something but you ’re still in costume , and I have a killer headache . ”
68947	68950	68951	68951	He	67	“ Agreed . ”
68962	68966	68951	68951	He	67	“ Rain check ? ”
68985	68988	68967	68968	The man	381	“ Sure . ”
69003	69020	68992	68992	I	0	“ Uh , tell your family I say hi . I ’ll see you at work . ”
69021	69030	69041	69041	he	67	“ Right . Right . See you there . ”
69056	69071	69072	69072	He	67	“ I think the party went well . The Stonewoods seem to love you . ”
69075	69080	69081	69081	He	67	“ And me too . ”
69168	69173	69174	69174	I	0	“ I hate you , ”
69536	69545	69522	69522	Josie	108	“ Everyone is still talking about the weekend . ”
69546	69551	69552	69552	I	0	“ Oh , great , ”
69559	69565	69552	69552	I	0	“ Thanks for the coffee . ”
69566	69620	69638	69638	her	108	“ Sure . Also , I pulled a few notes on our marketing efforts for the meeting later . I think if we discussed merging one of our other pharmaceutical company ’s branding with Levvetor ’s and consulted the finance team regarding what we could afford , the Levvetor acquisition would be beneficial . ”
69621	69625	69626	69626	I	0	“ Great idea . ”
69641	69668	69669	69669	Josie	108	“ Thanks so much for looking into it . I was n’t sure anyone would have the time to review any of this before the meeting . ”
69674	69710	69669	69669	Josie	108	“ We ’re all part of Stonewood Enterprises , Vick . If we do n’t have time , we make it . I think it will be a great work session . See you later . ”
69723	69744	69711	69711	Gloria	96	“ ‘ Work session ’ ? I saw that in the meeting reminder you sent this morning . Nice touch . ”
69771	69783	69757	69757	I	0	“ I thought it might help but now it seems silly . ”
69784	69804	69815	69815	she	56	“ It ’ll help . Everyone here is competitive . They ’ll all try to one up each other . ”
69805	69811	69815	69815	she	56	“ Let ’s hope so , ”
69836	69847	69821	69821	Steven	67	“ We ’re talking about the meeting later , Steven . ”
69848	69880	69881	69881	He	67	“ Oh . That ’s great . It ’s just , we ’re right in front of Jett ’s office . I do n’t want him to think we ’re just … ”
69910	69921	69903	69903	Gloria	96	“ You think my boss would ever believe I ’m … ”
69940	69948	69935	69935	her	96	“ Please . Go back to work . ”
69994	70026	70027	70027	She	96	“ I ’ll go set up the conference area for later . Do not be afraid . Jett smells fear . Brey , you know exactly what I ’m talking about . ”
70035	70045	70027	70027	She	96	“ I ’m more than a little frightened now . ”
70046	70055	70056	70056	Brey	56	“ At least she ’s on our side , ”
70060	70068	70056	70056	Brey	56	“ The deal is ours to lose . ”
70069	70080	70081	70081	Brey	56	“ And you ’ve never lost a thing , Vick , ”
70502	70556	70491	70491	she	51	“ I ’m hoping you can each write down a question or concern you may have in regard to backing Levvetor on the pink Post - it . On the blue , let us know a reason you think it may be a good idea . Then , let ’s go through them . ”
70762	70765	70745	70745	he	142	“ Great . ”
70805	70856	70790	70790	She	51	“ It seems we have a lot of great ideas on how to make the Levvetor acquisition work . So , are we all in agreement that we should invest a significant amount of our quarterly budget in this company , even knowing that the FDA may rule against it ? ”
70872	70886	70857	70857	I	0	“ The CEO of their biggest competitor is on that board of advisors . ”
70933	70943	70944	70944	Vick	51	“ Do you think we ca n’t handle it ? ”
70947	70964	70944	70944	Vick	51	“ I ’ve never taken on a venture we were incapable of handling , Ms. Blakely . ”
70965	70998	70915	70915	She	96	“ And yet you ’re hesitating on this one . I realize that the FDA is a very large government entity . But Stonewood Enterprises does n’t have a limit , right ? ”
70999	71041	70944	70944	Vick	51	“ While limits are made to be broken , they also serve as a reminder to evaluate the options . I ’m not questioning my team ’s capabilities because I want to . I ’m questioning them because I have to . ”

Our team is methodical , dependable , and innovative enough to manage it . Without us , lives will be lost and this company will most likely not stay afloat . That ’ll be on you . ”
71312	71348	71349	71349	I	0	“ Victory , you proved a very good point this weekend when we all let off a little steam . We do better with a workload we do n’t have to push ourselves to handle . ”
71358	71390	71349	71349	I	0	“ If we ’re overworked , we burn out . We need time to unwind so we can come back refreshed like we did after the party . Right , everyone ? ”
71400	71476	71349	71349	I	0	“ My father built this tower and company only by putting together the hardest working teams he could find . We all know that my father lost his wife for a very long time because he sacrificed putting her first . The company was his love , and he mulled over every single decision he made like it was his child . Every time you go in hard , you risk everything else coming second . But”—I

71879	71898	71874	71874	Gloria	96	“ Armanellis can be bitches to handle , and Levvetor is proving to be a big ass beast . ”

71979	72010	71972	71972	Her	96	“ Agreed . I ’ve been working harder under the knowledge that I ’m now the assistant to the sole owner of Stonewood Enterprises . Your father resigning motivated me . ”
72040	72047	72062	72062	her	96	“ You ready to quit yet ? ”
72048	72060	72062	72062	her	96	“ No . I ’m tired and wound up for sure . ”

72709	72749	72700	72700	She	96	“ Enjoy the drink . Take a load off . The team ’s working like they ’re on ecstasy or something . Vick ’s fun vibe is working , which means you get to work less . Enjoy it . ”

74464	74496	74458	74458	He	67	“ Relax , Pix . I ’m taking the morning off to help you let go of whatever the hell is bothering you . Your tension is making everyone else tense . ”

74538	74609	74535	74535	I	0	“ You buzz in and they buzz up . You barrel forward and they do too . Bob called me the other day to explain a new take on a contract . He nailed it , and then proceeded to tell me about the cookie he was eating that you ’d brought in . They move with you whether you ’re happy or in a funk like you are now . ”

76622	76654	76655	76655	She	51	“ So , what ? You a generic phantom haunting all of us with the facts of the day ? We do n’t care about the details of the actual musical . ”

76837	76881	76834	76834	She	51	“ I had a plan , you know ? I was going to date a nice , competent guy with a suitable job and get married . He would love me , and we would fit perfectly in a sweet little saltbox house . ”
76889	76920	76882	76882	She	51	“ It was a good plan . Solid . And Steven checked all the boxes . He ’s sweet enough and nice enough and he obviously has a good job . ”
76921	76959	76960	76960	She	51	“ He ’s an annoying shell of a man . You and I both know it . He bent over backwards and was willing to sleep around on you just to have a bro night with me . ”
76973	76982	76970	76970	she	51	“ Whatever . He was perfect for me . ”
76990	77017	76983	76983	I	0	“ What ’s it you said to me earlier in our messages ? Oh , right . ‘ Get fucked ’ because that ’s a lie . ”

77118	77138	77112	77112	she	51	“ We need this conversation to be over , and we probably need to stop what we ’re doing . ”
77139	77145	77112	77112	she	51	“ You ’re that scared ? ”
77146	77182	77112	77112	she	51	“ I ’m not exactly excited about falling for you and having my heart broken . I ’ll fall too . Like an idiot seeing all the stop signs and still going full speed ahead . ”
77183	77204	77112	77112	she	51	“ You do have a tendency to do the opposite of what the signs say . Hawaii , for example … ”
77205	77214	77112	77112	she	51	“ This is n’t a joke , Jett . ”
77215	77262	77112	77112	she	51	“ For once , you do n’t want to lighten up . Fine . Entertain my idea for a second . You can live on the edge a little , we can see where it goes . Do n’t you want to see where this goes ? ”
77263	77275	77112	77112	she	51	“ Can you honestly say you think it ’ll go somewhere ? ”
77276	77282	77112	77112	she	51	“ I do n’t know . ”
77283	77311	77112	77112	she	51	“ And that ’s the problem . I want someone to know . I could know with you . If you wanted it , I could know . ”
77312	77385	77386	77386	Her	1874	“ You ’re trying to check off boxes , Vick . And that ’s not the fairy tale you want . You could know with anyone because you just want the life you planned . That ’s you shooting for the sky but you work for me . We go above and beyond the sky . Me and you , if we end up working , we ’ll be beyond , Pix . ”
77407	77413	77393	77393	She	1874	“ Who gave you those ? ”

77441	77459	77393	77393	She	1874	“ What do I want and need ? Can you tell just by me looking at them ? ”
77460	77481	77482	77482	She	1874	“ You want the world , Victory Blakely , and I ’m going to try and give it to you . ”
77528	77542	77515	77515	she	1874	“ You ’re mixing up my thoughts , Jett . I sat in that chair”—she

77606	77628	77629	77629	She	1874	“ Let ’s go past the sign that says Imminent Shitstorm Ahead , Pix . Let ’s see if we can . ”
77683	77691	77679	77679	She	1874	“ Do n’t disappoint me , Phantom . ”

83068	83085	83086	83086	I	0	“ I ’m going home . My mother ’s request . I want you with me . ”
83096	83105	83086	83086	I	0	“ That ’s probably not a superb idea . ”
83135	83141	83106	83106	I	0	“ Did you just shower ? ”
83142	83145	83146	83146	She	51	“ Yes . ”
83158	83168	83148	83148	her	51	“ Like I said , I need a minute . ”
83169	83173	83174	83174	She	51	“ For what ? ”
83180	83185	83174	83174	She	51	“ To get ready . ”
83186	83198	83199	83199	She	51	“ We are n’t going anywhere . Stay how you are . ”
83212	83224	83205	83205	her	51	“ I just ... I ’d rather put some makeup on . ”
83225	83228	83229	83229	I	0	“ No . ”
83246	83262	83240	83240	I	0	“ You remember the light in Hawaii ? How you thought the sunset changed things ? ”
83263	83266	83267	83267	she	51	“ Yes , ”
83271	83291	83267	83267	she	51	“ It does n’t . Just like some makeup on your face does n’t change anything for me either . ”
83292	83306	83240	83240	I	0	“ I do n’t know if I should take that as a compliment . ”
83307	83356	83357	83357	Her	51	“ Take it how you want . You ’re beautiful upside down and fucked or right side up and put together . It ’s a waste of time for you to put makeup on now . Especially since I plan to take you in your shower later tonight . ”
83382	83399	83400	83400	She	51	“ I did n’t expect you , so my place is a little out of sorts . ”
83411	83444	83400	83400	She	51	“ I ’m not worried about it , Pix . You told me you were staying here for Thanksgiving . I thought I was too . So , come home with me . ”
83445	83452	83470	83470	she	51	“ I have work to do . ”
83453	83462	83470	83470	she	51	“ So do I. Work with me there . ”
83463	83466	83467	83467	She	51	“ Why ? ”
83498	83516	83517	83517	Her	51	“ I do n’t want to be alone dealing with the damn happy life everyone is living . ”
83534	83548	83517	83517	Her	51	“ Are n’t you living a fortunate life ? The life you want ? ”
83549	83563	83517	83517	Her	51	“ Sure but it is n’t the one they want me to live . ”
83564	83571	83572	83572	I	0	“ So , are you ashamed ? ”
83580	83590	83572	83572	I	0	“ No , woman . Just come with me . ”
83591	83616	83517	83517	Her	51	“ Why would I go sit with your family on a holiday , Jett ? I ’m not your girlfriend . It ’s weird . ”
83617	83622	83572	83572	I	0	“ You are n’t ? ”
83623	83626	83627	83627	she	51	“ No ! ”
83644	83653	83627	83627	she	51	“ So what the hell are you then ? ”
83654	83673	83572	83572	I	0	“ I just figured ... I do n’t know . I was the person you were sleeping with . ”
83674	83707	83572	83572	I	0	“ We established we were n’t just messing around . You ’re the only person I ’m sleeping with , and I better be the only one you ’re sleeping with too . ”
83708	83717	83627	83627	she	51	“ I have family to see on Thanksgiving . ”
83718	83733	83572	83572	I	0	“ You specifically told me this week you were n’t going to see them . ”
83734	83743	83572	83572	I	0	“ Well , maybe I changed my mind . ”
83744	83758	83627	83627	she	51	“ Pack a bag for Wednesday . We ’re staying over two nights . ”
83759	83767	83572	83572	I	0	“ I do n’t want to go . ”
83768	83795	83572	83572	I	0	“ Tough shit . I want you there and you do n’t need to be eating Thanksgiving dinner here all by yourself . You ’re coming . ”
83796	83804	83627	83627	she	51	“ Can you be any more demanding ? ”
83805	83826	83827	83827	I	0	“ Absolutely . Take off your top , hop up on that counter of yours , and spread those legs . ”
83834	83852	83827	83827	I	0	“ I need to fuck some sense into you for thinking you could ever tell me no . ”
83911	83924	83906	83906	she	1935	“ Yeah , I ’m still healthy . What do you mean ? ”
83962	83981	83940	83940	She	1935	“ No , Bastian . I ’m not concerned because the product was and has always been good . ”
84004	84019	83992	83992	her	1935	“ Why is he asking you how you are ? That a personal call ? ”
84020	84029	84085	84085	She	1935	“ Jealousy does n’t suit you , Phantom . ”
84030	84053	84054	84054	She	1935	“ I beg to differ . If I put my hands down your pants right now , I ’d find you wet . ”
84059	84067	84068	84068	I	0	“ Overconfidence does n’t suit you either . ”
84071	84084	84085	84085	She	1935	“ Answer the question . He call you for more than business ? ”
84088	84098	84085	84085	She	1935	“ It ’s all business . He ’s just — ”
84132	84148	84122	84122	I	0	“ I have n’t told my mother that I ’m not coming to Thanksgiving yet . ”
84149	84164	84118	84118	she	1935	“ That ’s not going to be a fun conversation , I ’m guessing . ”
84165	84187	84188	84188	Her	1935	“ No . It wo n’t be . We do n’t really see eye to eye on a lot , so … ”
84225	84238	84213	84213	I	0	“ Hi , Ms. Blakely . How can I help you today ? ”
84243	84262	84213	84213	I	0	“ Well , I called to talk with my daughter who owns this phone . Who is this ? ”
84274	84281	84266	84266	She	1935	“ Jett Stonewood . Her boss . ”
84290	84308	84282	84282	Her	1935	“ It ’s past seven . She ’s still at work ? You keep her that late ? ”
84343	84349	84330	84330	She	362	“ We ’re not working . ”
84357	84369	84330	84330	She	362	“ Also , I invited her to my family ’s Thanksgiving . ”
84395	84405	84392	84392	she	362	“ I ’d like to speak with Victory now . ”
84411	84415	84392	84392	she	362	“ Mrs. Blakely … ”
84416	84423	84424	84425	The woman	362	“ Give my daughter her phone . ”
84448	84479	84424	84425	The woman	362	“ If it ’s any consolation , I hope to meet you at some point . You ’ve raised a hell of a woman and you managed a great company . ”
84522	84527	84528	84528	she	51	“ Hi , Mom , ”
84536	84577	84528	84528	she	51	“ No , Mom . I ’m not ... Yes . No , Steve and I were n’t ... right . I understand he ’s part of the family … I agree that dating my boss is n’t the smartest . ”
84637	84679	84680	84680	She	362	“ Mom , I just ca n’t talk about that right now … Because … no , it is n’t anyone ’s business but mine . And I can take care of myself . I ’ve been doing just fine here . ”
84690	84722	84680	84680	She	362	“ No . I do n’t want you to come visit . I ’ll come home in a few weeks . I promise … Of course Dad needs to see me . ”
84735	84774	84775	84775	She	362	“ Mom , he has to deal with you daily , I know he needs me there now more than ever . You ’ll run him into the ground otherwise . I wo n’t make plans for Christmas . ”
84780	84806	84775	84775	She	362	“ I do n’t know Mom . We are n’t … it is n’t really like that . He just wants me there for Thanksgiving . ”
84817	84827	84807	84807	I	0	“ I ’ll come for Christmas . Happy to . ”
84841	84869	84870	84870	she	362	“ Yeah , okay . Well , we can talk about it later , Mom . I ’m not committing to bringing him . I love you , ”
84873	84876	84870	84870	she	362	“ Goodbye . ”
84893	84902	84877	84877	She	362	“ What in the actual fuck , Jett ? ”
84903	84914	84870	84870	she	362	“ You silence that phone every single time she calls . ”
84915	84921	84870	84870	she	362	“ And for good reason . ”
84922	84928	84877	84877	She	362	“ She micromanages your life ? ”
84929	84934	84870	84870	she	362	“ Among other things . ”
84946	84951	84935	84935	She	362	“ Care to elaborate ? ”
84952	84956	84877	84877	She	362	“ Not really . ”
84957	84986	84877	84877	She	362	“ You know , if you were a business deal , I ’d say the whole thing was off . You ca n’t hide your hand like that . ”
84987	85007	84935	84935	She	362	“ I ’m not a business deal , Jett . And I ’m sure you ’re hiding things too . ”
85008	85017	85018	85018	She	362	“ Ask me anything you want to know . ”
85033	85036	85018	85018	She	362	“ Really ? ”
85037	85040	85041	85041	She	362	“ Ask . ”
85064	85078	85041	85041	She	362	“ Why are you so against relationships or marriage or happiness in general ? ”
85079	85086	85018	85018	She	362	“ Why would n't I be ? ”
85087	85096	85041	85041	She	362	“ Because normal people want a happy ending . ”
85097	85111	85112	85112	She	362	“ I get that all the time when I sleep with a woman . ”
85118	85125	85112	85112	She	362	“ You know what I mean . ”
85126	85159	85041	85041	She	362	“ Why do I need a reason to believe in reality ? It ’s a fact that all relationships end at some time or other . You break up or you die . ”
85160	85165	85041	85041	She	362	“ That ’s morbid . ”
85166	85194	85112	85112	She	362	“ I had a great childhood , if that ’s what you ’re asking . Everyone knows that . They ’ve printed it in magazine after magazine . ”
85195	85210	85041	85041	She	362	“ You could have told them to print that . Is it the truth ? ”
85221	85294	85211	85211	I	0	“ My parents fought when they separated , sure , but there was always love there . I was n’t deprived as a child . I did n’t have a traumatic relationship , maybe one or two women scorned but nothing life altering . I do n’t have a reason for the way I am . I do n’t need one , Vick . I honestly believe it makes the most sense . ”
85295	85314	85112	85112	She	362	“ I just think it ’s a sad way to live . With no hope for something better . ”
85315	85340	85112	85112	She	362	“ I hope to make other lives better . I try to run a successful business . I try to push this city forward . ”
85341	85375	85112	85112	She	362	“ Ah . You do n’t want the complication . You do realize being happy does n’t mean you have to quit putting one hundred and ten percent into your company , right ? ”
85376	85383	85384	85384	I	0	“ We ’ll agree to disagree . ”
85387	85405	85384	85384	I	0	“ My turn . You want to answer the question about your mother or your whimsical lifestyle ? ”
85406	85413	85112	85112	She	362	“ Ca n’t a girl dream ? ”
85414	85426	85112	85112	She	362	“ You take it to an extreme and you know it . ”
85427	85483	85112	85112	She	362	“ At one point in my life , I was wrapped in a lot of darkness , so much so it felt like tar clinging to every piece of my mind and dragging me into the pits of hell . I do n’t want to be there again . I wo n’t be there again . ”
85484	85502	85112	85112	She	362	“ If you do n’t confront the dark , you ca n’t ever get to the light . ”
85503	85521	85112	85112	She	362	“ Now that , Phantom , is the most profound thing you ’ve ever said to me . ”
85522	85537	85112	85112	She	362	“ Yeah , well , I have to come at you from different angles . ”
85538	85557	85558	85558	She	1954	“ Come at me straight on and you ’ll probably get me naked in that bed over there . ”
85621	85627	85628	85628	I	0	“ I need a drink , ”
85649	85671	85672	85672	Her	56	“ I ca n’t believe you are telling me this now , hours before you leave . On a work lunch . ”
85682	85694	85672	85672	Her	56	“ Well , when did you want me to tell you ? ”
85695	85702	85703	85703	She	56	“ Probably right when it happened . ”
85712	85755	85756	85756	She	56	“ Or the next day . Or even a call this morning would have been nice . A text with a brief summary that you would see me at my husband ’s family ’s Thanksgiving dinner because you are dating his brother . ”
85761	85775	85756	85756	She	56	“ I ’m honestly too shocked to go back to work I think . ”
85785	85801	85776	85776	I	0	“ You could probably tell your brother - in - law you ’re feeling sick . ”
85802	85826	85827	85827	she	56	“ Jett does n’t care if anyone is sick because he would work through it and expects us to do so as well , ”
85830	85833	85827	85827	she	56	“ Truth , ”
85844	85861	85862	85862	Brey	56	“ In his defense , we all love the work almost as much as he does . ”
85865	85875	85862	85862	Brey	56	“ We ’re killing it at the Tower lately . ”
85876	85901	85902	85902	She	56	“ I completely agree . I feel everyone ’s energy , and it just rubs off on me . I so enjoy our team . ”
85905	85929	85902	85902	She	56	“ I ’m not dropping this topic , Vick . You might be enjoying the team but you ’re definitely enjoying the boss . ”
85930	85933	85934	85934	Brey	56	“ Really ? ”
85968	85978	85958	85958	she	56	“ You know I do n’t kiss and tell . ”
85979	85986	85987	85987	she	56	“ You always kiss and tell , ”
85990	86001	85987	85987	she	56	“ So ! I ’m not doing it this time . ”
86002	86006	86007	86007	She	56	“ No need . ”
86015	86044	86007	86007	She	56	“ I ’m very aware you two are kissing . I feel it every time he glances your way . And he does , Vick . A lot . ”
86058	86061	86047	86047	her	56	“ Fine . ”
86068	86097	86062	86062	I	0	“ I want to believe he could be this committed guy who can put me before work . I want to be married and have what you have . ”
86116	86134	86135	86135	She	56	“ I know it sounds stupid . But I want it so bad . I always have . ”
86140	86161	86135	86135	She	56	“ I know you want those things and you deserve them , Vick . I just do n’t know if … ”
86162	86178	86179	86179	I	0	“ If Jett ’s the one for that ? If he ’s just having fun ? ”
86205	86240	86192	86192	she	56	“ Lately , there are so many moments where he says just the right thing and acts just the right way that I think he might want it too . And I believe him . ”
86241	86253	86185	86185	she	56	“ He probably does want those things . It ’s just … ”
86254	86274	86275	86275	She	56	“ You are n’t sure he ’s capable of getting them with how invested he is in the company ? ”
86278	86284	86275	86275	She	56	“ I do n’t know . ”
86288	86309	86285	86285	I	0	“ I have to remind myself that I ’m probably imagining all of it because I want it so bad . ”
86310	86354	86185	86185	she	56	“ You are n’t . And even if you are , it ’s okay to want things . It ’s okay to hope . I hope for both of your sakes that it works . The two of you seem so much happier . ”
86355	86390	86185	86185	she	56	“ But we ’re happy until we ’re not . What if I ’m still doing the same thing with him in ten years ? What if he ca n’t commit to anything more ? ”
86391	86397	86285	86285	I	0	“ Have you asked him ? ”
86398	86441	86442	86442	I	0	“ After just a few weeks of dating ? I mean he did just claim I was his girlfriend , but that was in the heat of the moment . Honestly , I do n’t even know if we are actually dating . ”
86454	86476	86442	86442	I	0	“ Oh , you ’re dating . Jett ’s made it clear to Bastian . Very , very , very clear . ”
86477	86485	86285	86285	I	0	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
86486	86496	86442	86442	I	0	“ Bastian told Jax and Katie , I guess . ”
86497	86504	86505	86505	I	0	“ Katie ’s still seeing Bastian ? ”
86514	86526	86505	86505	I	0	“ That must be why she has n’t returned my calls . ”
86527	86559	86560	86560	I	0	“ She ’s in a weird place . I think something is going on with her and Rome , honestly . Do n’t say anything but I think they slept together . ”
86599	86618	86592	86592	Brey	56	“ So , you knew ? You did n’t tell me because I ’ve slept with him too ? ”
86628	86663	86619	86619	I	0	“ Honestly , Brey , you went through so much last year , you did n’t need to know that the guy you ’d slept with also slept with one of your best friends . ”
86664	86671	86672	86672	she	56	“ We sound so messed up , ”
86675	86686	86672	86672	she	56	“ Are n’t the best of friends always messed up ? ”
86692	86723	86687	86687	I	0	“ I like to think we ’ll figure it out one day . Until then , I guess we get to see how awkward Thanksgiving dinner is going to be . ”
86724	86740	86741	86741	Nancy	153	“ It ’ll be fine . I ’m just a friend . Nancy loves me . ”
86858	86872	86855	86855	Brey	56	“ Nancy will be so happy you came . She ’ll wonder though . ”
86873	86893	86894	86894	Brey	56	“ I ’m going to need to drink a lot to get through this holiday , are n’t I ? ”
86897	86918	86894	86894	Brey	56	“ Depends on if you act like you ’re actually seeing the man . You could just be tagging along . ”
86919	86922	86923	86923	I	0	“ Yes ! ”
86929	86968	86923	86923	I	0	“ That is perfect . I drove home with him because we got off work at the same time , and we thought it would be fun to have me tag along because I was n’t going home . ”
86969	86975	86894	86894	Brey	56	“ As long as Jett — ”
86976	86982	86983	86983	I	0	“ He does n’t care . ”
86988	87001	86983	86983	I	0	“ It will just make everyone more comfortable . No awkward vibes . ”
87002	87006	86894	86894	Brey	56	“ It probably — ”
87007	87040	86983	86983	I	0	“ Thank you . I was worried . I did n’t know what to think . When he asked … I just thought … Does he normally bring women back for Thanksgiving ? ”
87074	87084	87067	87067	I	0	“ Oh , God . Do n’t answer that . ”
87085	87106	87067	87067	I	0	“ It ’s probably something you should just ask him , Vick . He ’s never been too closed off . ”
87107	87133	87134	87134	I	0	“ Just blatantly open and honest and straightforward even when it ’s painful . The answer could be really , really excruciating at this point . ”
87163	87188	87156	87156	I	0	“ If that ’s how you feel , then you need to tell him . You need to be just as candid with him . ”
87189	87198	87241	87241	I	0	“ I ’m not sure I can be . ”
87199	87217	87218	87218	I	0	“ You better try . Or you will end up losing more than you think you have . ”
87245	87251	87241	87241	I	0	“ You got last lunch . ”
87259	87264	87253	87253	I	0	“ Keep the change . ”
87513	87575	87500	87500	Gloria	96	“ On behalf of Stonewood Enterprises , I ’d like to thank you all for your hard work this month . We ’ve done some outstanding work . To avoid holiday traffic and spend as much time with our families as possible , please take the rest of the day off and enjoy the long weekend . Again , thank you . ”
87576	87581	87582	87582	His	1993	“ Are you ready ? ”
87594	87599	87591	87591	I	0	“ Jesus , Jett . ”
87611	87623	87607	87607	Steve	67	“ I ’m sorry . Mr. Stonewood . You scared me . ”
87624	87628	87629	87629	His	1993	“ Mr. Stone — ”
87649	87662	87638	87638	his	1993	“ You ’re referring to me as Mr. Stonewood now , Victory ? ”
87706	87710	87711	87711	I	0	“ Of course . ”
87721	87741	87711	87711	I	0	“ You were going to give me a ride to see Brey and Jax over the holiday , right ? ”
87742	87746	87747	87747	Jett	51	“ Was I ? ”
87759	87782	87747	87747	Jett	51	“ I was under the impression I was giving you a ride to my family ’s house so you could meet them . ”
87799	87810	87794	87794	I	0	“ Tell your family I said hi and happy Thanksgiving . ”
87811	87818	87819	87819	he	1993	“ Uh , yeah . Sure , ”
87855	87874	87875	87875	I	0	“ Vick , did I mention I might have left my watch at your place on Halloween night ? ”
87926	87958	87911	87911	I	0	“ No , you did n’t mention it because that was about a month ago and I can assure you that you did n’t leave it there . Goodbye , Stevie . ”
88003	88020	87998	87998	I	0	“ Are you trying to make it everyone ’s business that I ’m sleeping with you ? ”
88021	88033	88034	88034	he	1993	“ I do n’t really care one way or the other , ”
88046	88052	88053	88053	I	0	“ Well , I do . ”
88060	88077	88053	88053	I	0	“ You ca n’t just start acting like we ’re intimate . People are already suspicious . ”
88078	88097	87998	87998	I	0	“ Suspicious ? Or territorial ? Seems Stevie wants to make it known that he slept with you . ”
88098	88183	88184	88184	Jett	51	“ Oh , please . Who cares if he ’s doing that ? It ’s not like he actually wants to be with me . It ’s only about impressing you or being the bigger man . If people think we ’re dating , that ’s a larger issue . The team is starting to trust me , and I want their trust . I like the career I ’ve started here . I have more respect than I ’ve ever had anywhere else . ”
88204	88210	88211	88211	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
88225	88240	88241	88241	I	0	“ Making something clear to you . I want your full attention for it . ”
88247	88254	88241	88241	I	0	“ That ’s a little dramatic . ”
88255	88269	88270	88270	He	2003	“ You told me before you do n’t belong to anyone , right ? ”
88283	88286	88275	88275	I	0	“ Right . ”
88287	88309	88330	88330	he	2003	“ Then I never want to hear another man try to metaphorically piss all over you in front of me again . ”
88310	88324	88325	88325	I	0	“ You ’re being ridiculous . You want me to call him out ? ”
88339	88350	88325	88325	I	0	“ You know how painful that would be for everyone ? ”
88351	88360	88364	88364	his	2003	“ You and making everyone feel at ease , ”
88379	88450	88361	88361	he	2003	“ I do n’t care whether it makes my whole office uncomfortable , Victory . I do n’t enjoy hearing a man imply that about you . I ’m not proud to say it just about nearly killed me to not fire him on the spot . If you ’re worried about making someone feel uncomfortable , know that I ’m twisted up inside listening to him being an asshole . ”
88451	88454	88455	88455	I	0	“ Phantom , ”
88490	88544	88485	88485	I	0	“ I made it pretty clear that no watch was left at my place . I ’m done with him and he knows it . And for the record , I never slept with him . There ’s nothing left for him to say . So , he wo n’t do it again . ”
88545	88589	88590	88590	I	0	“ No . He wo n’t . Because I ’m coming to realize if you belong to anyone other than yourself , it ’s me . You better realize it fast too . I will remove anyone from our lives who claims otherwise . ”
88605	88610	88590	88590	I	0	“ Okay , Phantom . ”
88646	88658	88643	88643	his	2007	“ I ’m driving . My vehicle ’s in the garage . ”
88684	88694	88695	88695	He	2007	“ Do n’t you have work to attend to ? ”
88709	88717	88695	88695	He	2007	“ You ’ve got my full attention . ”
88718	88721	88722	88722	I	0	“ Oh . ”
88743	88755	88722	88722	I	0	“ I do n’t need it . I could work too . ”
88756	88778	88783	88783	he	2007	“ You also mentioned you ’re concerned people wo n't respect you in the office if we ’re in a relationship . ”
88794	88850	88851	88851	He	2007	“ I just think that we are n’t sure this relationship will work out . We are n’t even sure if this is a relationship . So , I do n’t think everyone needs to know about it . And by everyone , I sort of mean no one . No one needs to know . ”
88861	88878	88851	88851	He	2007	“ Interesting approach , Pix . What do you expect me to tell my family then ? ”
88879	88884	88885	88885	He	2007	“ Will they ask ? ”
88888	88909	88885	88885	He	2007	“ Someone will ask , woman . You think I bring all the women I sleep with home for Thanksgiving ? ”
88935	88949	88932	88932	I	0	“ I ’m Brey ’s friend . We ’ll just go with that . ”
89072	89078	89079	89079	He	2007	“ I ’m this way . ”
89096	89104	89079	89079	He	2007	“ I ’ve never been down here . ”
89105	89119	89136	89136	He	2007	“ It ’s pretty absurd in Chicago . Having a car is inefficient . ”
89120	89126	89127	89127	I	0	“ And yet you do , ”
89179	89187	89175	89175	My	0	“ You ’re kidding me , right ? ”
89188	89192	89193	89193	He	2007	“ About what ? ”
89204	89210	89193	89193	He	2007	“ This is grotesquely extravagant . ”
89224	89250	89254	89254	his	2007	“ Why would you have this big ass truck in the middle of Chicago where you ca n’t even fit into a damn parking spot ? ”
89307	89345	89300	89300	his	2007	“ I enjoy getting my hands on you any way I can . If I get that reaction every time I lift you into this dumbass truck , I ’m driving it to work from now on . ”
89346	89352	89353	89353	He	2007	“ Get real , Phantom . ”
89366	89386	89387	89387	He	2007	“ I ’m the most real thing you ’re ever going to have between your legs again , woman . ”
89464	89471	89472	89472	He	2007	“ We ’re in the workplace . ”
89475	89479	89472	89472	He	2007	“ My workplace , ”
89518	89532	89533	89533	he	2007	“ I swear you ’re trying to drive me insane with these outfits , ”
89552	89561	89533	89533	he	2007	“ It ’s conservative and very work appropriate . ”
89562	89590	89591	89591	he	2007	“ It ’s a fucking maze to get off you and looks like porn for the guys at work . Stevie stared at you all damn day , ”
89610	89634	89635	89635	I	0	“ Steve can stare all he likes , Jett , as can most men , if it helps get them through the day . ”
89647	89648	89638	89638	Jett	51	“ Victory,”—his

89736	89743	89744	89744	I	0	“ Guess party time is up , ”
89763	89769	89770	89770	he	2007	“ Give me a minute , ”
89792	89801	89786	89786	I	0	“ That all it takes , big man ? ”
89802	89814	89815	89815	He	2007	“ You ’re a devil wrapped in intoxicating clothing , woman . ”
89949	89954	89955	89955	he	2007	“ This is Greenville , ”
89974	89978	89979	89979	I	0	“ Small town , ”
90075	90093	90061	90061	his	2007	“ Yup , so small that every damn person is up your ass all day every day . ”
90094	90098	90061	90061	his	2007	“ Seems frustrating . ”
90099	90104	90105	90105	My	0	“ It ’s home . ”
90125	90149	90150	90150	He	2007	“ You kind of look like you fit here with this big pickup and your hair getting all blown around in the wind . ”
90157	90175	90150	90150	He	2007	“ My mom raised small - town boys . We could n’t shake it if we tried . ”
90176	90188	90207	90207	he	2007	“ You do n’t look it in your suit and tie . ”
90189	90200	90201	90201	he	2007	“ I ’m still in part of my suit now , ”
90332	90340	90318	90318	He	2007	“ What are you thinking , Pix ? ”
90350	90355	90341	90341	I	0	“ Nothing worth mentioning . ”
90356	90370	90318	90318	He	2007	“ I like your not - worth - mentioning thoughts . Hit me . ”
90371	90389	90394	90394	He	2007	“ Small towns make me think of big dreams of my picture - perfect future , Jett . ”
90390	90393	90394	90394	He	2007	“ Hmm . ”
90482	90485	90486	90486	he	2007	“ Ready ? ”
90514	90530	90505	90505	My	0	“ My dad ’s . And yes , probably every man in town has one . ”
90531	90540	90505	90505	My	0	“ Ah . It makes more sense now . ”
90541	90547	90548	90548	He	2007	“ What makes more sense ? ”
90553	90567	90548	90548	He	2007	“ Every man needs a bigger truck than the man down the road . ”
90568	90580	90581	90581	His	2007	“ I got the biggest , babe . Do n’t worry . ”

91115	91125	91126	91126	I	0	“ Yes . I was happy Brey invited me , ”
91138	91164	91165	91165	she	153	“ Oh , honey . Do n’t do that . Jett told us he was bringing you . I ’m happy he ’s dating someone , ”
91181	91192	91165	91165	she	153	“ Otherwise he ’ll end up just like his father . ”

91209	91217	91218	91218	she	153	“ Legally , we ’re still separated , ”
91232	91264	91229	91229	she	153	“ Make them work for it . It ’s what they deserve when they put in five hundred hours a week as if life outside of Stonewood Enterprises does n’t matter . ”
91303	91341	91296	91296	she	153	“ I ’ll show you to your room later . You ’re staying with Jett , right ? Now that we ’ve addressed the elephant that should n’t have been in the room in the first place ? ”
91342	91347	91348	91348	I	0	“ I ... um … ”
91379	91395	91362	91362	He	2080	“ She ’s staying with me , Mom . Give her a little breathing room . ”
91403	91424	91362	91362	He	2080	“ I can stay wherever . If it ’s Jett ’s room , he ’ll obviously sleep on the floor . ”
91425	91431	91432	91432	Nancy	153	“ Of course he will . ”
91467	91517	91439	91439	she	153	“ Take the edge off if you want . Just remember , you ’ve been known to drink with me and Brey before dating my son . I ’m still the same person , Vick . I just have more ammo to equip you with in the dating field . ”
91566	91574	91575	91575	I	0	“ I ’m trying to process everything , ”
91578	91588	91575	91575	I	0	“ I had a whole story prepared for today . ”

91643	91654	91636	91636	I	0	“ Maybe . I ’m not sure what to expect . ”
91655	91662	91663	91663	She	153	“ No one in love does . ”

91723	91730	91731	91731	he	2088	“ Want to get settled in ? ”
91737	91755	91731	91731	he	2088	“ Do n’t steal her from me already . I barely get any woman talk around here , ”
91759	91779	91756	91756	Nancy	153	“ You wanted this old man here with you all the time , Mom . Now you got him . ”
91793	91805	91786	91786	he	2090	“ We ’ll come have a drink once we get unpacked . ”
91897	91905	91882	91882	Jaydon	58	“ This is the cutest thing ever . ”
91906	91923	91935	91935	he	2088	“ Easter Sunday . My little brothers thought playing in the mud was a wonderful idea . ”
91941	91949	91935	91935	he	2088	“ Bedroom ’s this way , Pix . ”
91955	91968	91969	91969	He	2088	“ Give me a minute . I have to absorb your childhood . ”
91995	92005	91992	91992	he	2088	“ See . No glaring issues in my childhood . ”
92063	92069	92058	92058	I	0	“ When was this taken ? ”
92070	92093	92058	92058	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Probably when I was fifteen . My mom hired a photographer to capture the family dynamics . ”
92094	92101	92147	92147	him	2088	“ They captured them all right . ”
92102	92113	92058	92058	I	0	“ Getting paint everywhere for a picture serves no purpose . ”
92114	92120	92058	92058	I	0	“ What about enjoying yourself ? ”
92121	92135	92136	92136	I	0	“ Washing all that shit off was not enjoyable . I guarantee it . ”
92154	92160	92147	92147	him	2088	“ We ’re so different . ”
92161	92166	92143	92143	I	0	“ Water and oil . ”
92167	92176	92147	92147	him	2088	“ It must be something much more destructive . ”
92177	92190	92147	92147	him	2088	“ No . Yin and yang . We ’re working well together . ”
92191	92196	92143	92143	I	0	“ We ’ll see . ”
92252	92255	92239	92239	Jett	51	“ Seriously ? ”
92273	92281	92256	92256	I	0	“ Go to the bathroom to change . ”
92282	92286	92239	92239	Jett	51	“ What for ? ”
92287	92299	92300	92300	I	0	“ What if someone sees us in here with you naked ? ”
92303	92321	92300	92300	I	0	“ We ’re staying in the same bed . What do you think they expect , Pix ? ”
92322	92339	92340	92340	I	0	“ Oh , no . You ’re sleeping on the floor . I told your mother . ”
92351	92359	92360	92360	He	2088	“ You can have the comforter though . ”
92381	92387	92360	92360	He	2088	“ Not happening , Pix . ”
92388	92419	92420	92420	I	0	“ We ’re not sleeping in the same bed , Jett . It ’s disrespectful to come into your parents ’ home and do that when we ’re barely together . ”
92440	92469	92429	92429	he	2088	“ If you ’re in the same house , building , or even on the same fucking block as me , we ’re sleeping in the same bed . ”
92470	92480	92429	92429	he	2088	“ I do n’t want to disrespect your parents . ”
92481	92513	92514	92514	he	2088	“ Technically , they are n’t even married . They ca n’t be mad at us . And I do n’t care about disrespecting them . I have been for years , ”
92579	92588	92589	92589	He	2088	“ I ’m just going to freshen up . ”

93672	93676	93677	93677	she	2112	“ We should , ”
93688	93691	93677	93677	she	2112	“ Right . ”
93718	93724	93725	93725	She	2112	“ Remember to stay quiet . ”
93755	93758	93750	93750	Her	2112	“ Jett ? ”
93759	93795	93750	93750	Her	2112	“ This is for you . I get you in my old room where I used to not worry about a damn thing in the world . I want the same from you right now . ”

94340	94343	94344	94344	I	0	“ Jesus . ”

94466	94481	94458	94458	She	2112	“ Maybe if you had n’t left us for LA and the big screen . ”

94494	94498	94499	94499	she	2112	“ Prove it , ”
94512	94521	94522	94522	I	0	“ Vick , go put some clothes on , ”
94525	94532	94522	94522	I	0	“ Or leave your clothes off . ”

94566	94582	94560	94560	He	58	“ I ’ll see your fine ass and his grumpy one downstairs for breakfast soon . ”
94583	94587	94588	94588	She	2112	“ Sounds good . ”
94604	94627	94597	94597	she	2112	“ Do n’t tell me what to do like that in front of someone ever again . It ’s disrespectful and rude . ”
94628	94643	94560	94560	He	58	“ Do n’t hug men in front of me while you ’re naked then . ”
94644	94678	94597	94597	she	2112	“ First , I ’m not naked . I have a sheet wrapped around me . Second , even if I was , it is n’t something your brother has n’t seen before . Three,”—she

94830	94844	94823	94823	she	2112	“ I ’m not asking you who you ’ve slept with before me . ”
94845	94862	94823	94823	she	2112	“ Because there ’s no way in hell I ’d sleep with a sister of yours . ”
94863	94889	94890	94890	She	2112	“ Well , to be fair , I ’m an only child , so I guess we will never know the truth of that claim . ”
94914	94924	94911	94911	she	2112	“ I have n’t slept with Jaydon . Jeez . ”
94925	94929	94911	94911	she	2112	“ Thank God . ”
94943	94956	94930	94930	I	0	“ Now bend over so I can fuck some sense into you . ”
94966	95000	94957	94957	Her	2112	“ I ’ve been friends with him for years . It makes complete sense that he ’s seen me naked once or twice . You know I do n’t care if guys look . ”
95015	95038	94957	94957	Her	2112	“ Start caring , woman . Your body is n’t up for display unless you ’re displaying it to me . Privately . ”
95039	95046	95047	95047	she	2112	“ You ’re so damn territorial , ”

95215	95220	95221	95221	I	0	“ So it seems , ”
95282	95293	95294	95294	She	56	“ I ’m happy we both get the weekend off . ”
95307	95343	95299	95299	she	56	“ I ’m not bothering you to discuss work . I hope you can set aside the fact that you ’re my boss for a second and just be my brother - in - law . ”

95389	95394	95395	95395	She	56	“ Well , yes . ”

95421	95428	95415	95415	I	0	“ No . We ’re family . ”
95486	95511	95512	95512	I	0	“ Okay , well , then . As a part of your family , I ’ll let you know a little bit about mine . ”
95524	95609	95512	95512	I	0	“ Vick ’s not a toy . Do n’t play with her like one . If you do , I ’ll never forgive you , and that might not mean much to you , and you might not care , but I ’m in this Stonewood family for life . So , for the rest of your life , I will make every single family event you attend a train wreck . It is n’t polite or nice , but I ’ll do it . ”
95610	95617	95618	95618	She	56	“ Brey , I ’m not — ”
95624	95639	95618	95618	She	56	“ Just do n’t play with her . That ’s all I ’m asking . ”
95694	95699	95700	95700	I	0	“ It ’s Thanksgiving , ”
95709	95747	95748	95748	I	0	“ FDA wants to push one of Levvetor ’s ingredients in one drug to the forefront . Seems they are willing to drag the brand name through the mud , even with Stonewood Enterprises attached to it . ”
95755	95760	95748	95748	I	0	“ You ’re sure ? ”
95761	95774	95703	95703	my	0	“ I would n't call you on Thanksgiving for shits and giggles . ”
95775	95793	95703	95703	my	0	“ Vick and Bob scrutinized the letter to them for hours before sending . They received it ? ”

95862	95879	95920	95920	she	51	“ I can take care of it my way or we can do it your way . ”
95880	95886	95887	95887	I	0	“ My way ’s cleaner , ”
95938	95942	95943	95943	she	51	“ You okay ? ”
95949	95955	95943	95943	she	51	“ That Vick with you ? ”
95956	95961	95920	95920	she	51	“ Does n’t matter . ”
95962	95972	95925	95925	She	51	“ It does . Let me talk to her . ”
95973	95999	96000	96000	My	0	“ No . We do this my way . I ’ll pull investments and revoke the partnership on the dairy company the FDA is backing . ”
96027	96035	96036	96036	Bastian	88	“ It ’ll be a tremendous loss , ”
96039	96060	96036	96036	Bastian	88	“ I ’m aware , and I ’m the only one capable of handling that loss without it bankrupting me . ”

96230	96265	96266	96266	Her	51	“ Do n’t ever second - guess yourself if you wanted it badly enough to fight for it in the beginning . If it was worth it then , it ’s worth it now . ”
96280	96288	96272	96272	she	51	“ I think it 's worth it . ”
96289	96296	96297	96297	I	0	“ And you ’re worth it . ”
96316	96325	96309	96309	I	0	“ Let ’s go . I ’m hungry . ”

96608	96611	96612	96612	She	266	“ Okay ! ”
96623	96652	96612	96612	She	266	“ I ’ll bring your father . We ’ll make a day of it . The nutritionist said he ’s had a hard time getting ahold of you . ”
96667	96713	96662	96662	She	266	“ No worries . I told him you got a new job , sweetie . It ’s hard to keep up with everything . I made a list of the changes he felt might help . And your doctor ’s appointment is tomorrow , right ? ”
96752	96778	96809	96809	My	0	“ Yeah . Um , it was a day I had off . So , I figured I would get it out of the way . ”

97099	97129	97130	97130	he	2153	“ I know , Vick . I know . She does n’t have her job or you to manage anymore though . She ’s an empty nester on steroids , ”
97165	97189	97130	97130	he	2153	“ I ’ll be home for Christmas . We ’ll decorate the tree together . I ’ll come home for it , okay ? ”
97190	97224	97281	97281	him	2157	“ Yeah , yeah . Do n’t come for my benefit . I can handle her . I just think you need to face each other soon . Something ’s got ta give . ”

97522	97529	97530	97530	Brey	56	“ Are we eating in here ? ”
97536	97564	97530	97530	Brey	56	“ No . Nancy thinks the table is too big . I think Jax ’s dad had this room decorated for business dinners back in the day . ”
97577	97586	97587	97587	Brey	56	“ Where are we going to eat then ? ”
97593	97607	97587	97587	Brey	56	“ There ’s another dining area on the other side of the kitchen . ”
97621	97629	97612	97612	Jaydon	58	“ Should we go for a walk ? ”
97643	97651	97652	97652	he	58	“ I ’m coming for the walk , ”
97655	97662	97663	97663	Nancy	153	“ It ’s just us girls , ”
97668	97681	97663	97663	Nancy	153	“ Girls are my best friends , Mom . I ’m coming . ”
97701	97715	97695	97695	he	58	“ You ’re all going to need coats . It ’s getting chilly . ”
97933	97940	97941	97941	Brey	56	“ This is my favorite place , ”
97967	97976	97963	97963	She	2184	“ I found myself and my family here . ”
97977	97983	97963	97963	She	2184	“ We found you too . ”
97993	98014	97986	97986	her	153	“ Your mom would have been so proud of you . She ’d think I need grandchildren soon , but … ”
98053	98073	98031	98031	Brey	56	“ Jax and I need time to work on ourselves before we bring a little human into this world . ”
98074	98081	98082	98082	Nancy	153	“ That never stops , Brey , ”
98085	98100	98082	98082	Nancy	153	“ You ’ll be working on yourselves forever . Look at me and Joe . ”

98188	98200	98201	98201	he	58	“ And I ’ll be one till the day I die , ”
98204	98246	98201	98201	he	58	“ You might take my side , but I need to work on myself too . I need to work at a lot of things if we are going to really give this relationship a go . Everyone compromises in relationships . ”
98265	98285	98286	98286	She	153	“ Your dad quit the company , but he ’ll never quit working . He loves it too much . ”

98413	98451	98383	98383	she	153	“ That ’s what uncles do ! They fly into town , spoil the kids , and fly out . I have to make movies . I ’m over there trying to make this world feel something . ”
98452	98467	98468	98468	she	153	“ Your rom - coms are really making people feel things , all right , ”
98475	98491	98468	98468	she	153	“ Did you see his last rom - com ? He barely said two words . ”
98492	98526	98527	98527	I	0	“ Well , in Jaydon ’s defense , no one really wanted him or his costar to talk anyway . Them walking around in their swimsuits the whole movie was enough for everyone . ”

He would instruct them . He was born to be the businessman he is . I know that . I just honestly do n’t know if he has it in him to be anything else . ”
99128	99177	99178	99178	Her	2204	“ I love him . It ’s why I ’m warning you . He never brings women home for the holidays . He wants something with you . I ca n’t quite figure out if he has it in him to give a woman what she needs though . ”
99189	99244	99245	99245	I	0	“ I ’m not sure because he ’s like his father , and I still struggle every single day to figure out if that man can give me what I need . I see that look in your eyes . It ’s the same look I ’ve had for years . You love him . ”

You ’re worried that you ’ll never get the love you put in returned , and I ’m here telling you I honestly do n’t know that you will . I wish I could say differently because I really , really want grandkids . ”

101919	101961	101962	101962	He	160	“ It ’ll come to a vote within your administration , but I want you to know the side you should be voting for . I think we can do that without Jett discussing dairy and without Bastian here , huh ? ”
101972	102005	101962	101962	He	160	“ I hope so . Right now , I need to see more evidence . We ’re working on testing , and I hope your teams are working on alternative ingredients too . ”
102017	102061	102013	102014	Mrs. Blakely	2275	“ I wanted to introduce you to Mrs. Blakely . She and Vick here , who is an employee of Stonewood Enterprises , can provide you with a perfect example of why this drug needs to be an option for patients with leukemia . ”
102298	102350	102351	102351	she	152	“ My family does n’t go to great lengths to share our story because it does n’t define us . We ’re Blakelys . We define ourselves . When we battle something as terrifying as cancer , we ’re humbled . Vick , Harvey wants our family to do a commercial , ”
102400	102403	102404	102405	Her mother	309	“ No . ”

103854	103947	103839	103839	I	0	“ Well , I ’ll inform you then . I ’m the guy who screws you into oblivion and then stays to see the sun rise on your skin . I ’m the guy who wakes up thinking of you and goes to sleep only to dream about you . I ’m your boss , but I ’m also your lover . I ’m definitely your only boyfriend , and I ’m the one who you ’ve been contemplating spending your life with even if you do n’t want to admit it . ”
104051	104224	104039	104039	I	0	“ Most days , I wake up wondering if it will be the day I start to feel a little more tired , if I ’ll maybe get a pain in my bones that will signal the cancer is back . Most days , I ’m determined to wake up and avoid every reminder of that looming statistic , the one that Levvetor and all those pharmaceutical companies promote . I ’m a damn good stat in their eyes . I ’ve survived past their five - year studies , and they do n’t even follow up any more . To them , I survived and their job is done . Yet , every single day , I feel like I ’m dying . Like I ’m not living big enough , well enough , not experiencing enough . So , yeah , I do n’t want the reminder from you , or anyone else , that I ’m a survivor or that I had leukemia . I want to forget it . ”

And even if you are n’t thinking about my past , I ’ll wonder if you are whenever you ask me how I ’m doing or how I ’ve been feeling . My paranoia will creep in , and I ’ll never feel like the invincible girl you saw before they played that godforsaken commercial . ”
