NINE JACKSON My father once told me the only difference between a woman and a man - eating shark was the size of their teeth . At the time I ’d agreed with him . I ’d had good reason to . But watching Bianca Hardwick move gracefully around my kitchen , making us lunch while chatting animatedly with Charlie and interacting with Cody as if she ’d known him since birth , made me think that might have been too harsh a judgment . And no shark on earth had an ass like Bianca ’s . Besides being a fucking masterpiece of design , the damn thing was an eyeball magnet . I ’d already caught myself half a dozen times ogling it , my dick twitching under my zipper like some horny teenager ’s . Even those hideous brown work pants she favored that looked like they were made from old potato sacks could n’t diminish its appeal . It was so round , like an apple . So taut and smooth . I wanted to bend her over the stool , yank those pants down her hips , and sink my teeth into it . I wanted to squeeze it and kiss it and stroke it an TEN BIANCA The first thing I did after Rayford dropped me off at the restaurant was hustle over to the bank to deposit Jackson ’s check into my mama ’s account . We ’d scheduled her initial round of chemo for a few days away , and I did n’t want to take any chances that Jackson , in one of his inexplicable beastie moods , would put a stop payment on the check . With that done , I felt better . Until I ran smack into my ex in the bank ’s parking lot . Literally into him . The noise I made when I collided with his chest was something so unladylike my mama would ’ve pitched a hissy fit if she ’d heard it . It was part grunt , part groan , and part something that sounded like it shot out of my butthole on a hot burst of air , excuse my French . Hands flailing , I dropped my pocketbook on the ground and stumbled back in surprise . “

Doc Halloran had told us what to expect in the way of side effects of the chemo , but neither Mama nor I was prepared for the reality of it . She felt fine for the first few days , and then everything kicked in with one big wallop . The nausea and vomiting were the least of it . She also had massive headaches , frightful mouth sores , and fatigue so bad she could hardly get out of bed . I went with her every day to the hospital for the first week , then helped out at the house during the second , trying to get her to eat and fielding all her callers , turning them away with excuses that she had the flu . Even the poor Colonel was n’t allowed inside . Mama did n’t have the energy to put on her face and pretend , so away he went , shoulders slumped . I did n’t think it was right she did n’t tell him what was really going on , but it was n’t my place to make that decision . But most of all , I dreaded what GINGER - ORANGE CHEESECAKE Makes 8 servings 1½ cups graham cracker crumbs ⅓ cup butter , melted ⅓ cup white sugar 32 ounces cream cheese , softened ⅔ cup white sugar , plus 2 tablespoons 1 cup sour cream , divided 1 tablespoon grated orange peel 4 eggs 2 cups clementine wedges ½ cup finely chopped crystallized ginger Preparation Preheat oven to 325 degrees . Mix graham cracker crumbs , butter , and ⅓ cup sugar together . Press on bottom of 9² x 3² springform pan and just enough up sides to seal bottom . Place cream cheese , ⅔ cup sugar , ½ cup sour cream , and orange peel in food processor . Cover and process about 3 minutes or until smooth . Add eggs . Cover and process until well blended . Spread over crust . Bake 1 hour 20 minutes , or until center is set . Cool on wire rack for 15 minutes . Using spatula around edges to loosen , remove side of pan . Refrigerate uncovered 3 hours or until chilled , then cover and continue refrigerating at least 4 hours , but not longer than 48 hours . Mix ½ cup sour cream and TWELVE BIANCA Though I wanted to turn and bolt , I did n’t . The man had paid me an obscene amount of money for this job , after all . And I was a professional . I would n’t embarrass him in front of all his guests by refusing his request . Also , I was intrigued by this new Jackson , this well - dressed stranger who spoke so eloquently about honor and selflessness and used words like please . I did n’t think that word was in his vocabulary . So it was with curiosity — and a healthy dose of embarrassment — that I walked around the perimeter of the tables and climbed the few stairs to the stage . Then shock took over as Jackson wound his arm around my shoulders , pulled me against his side , and smiled down at me . I was too busy trying not to keel over in surprise to pay much attention to how perfectly I fit under his arm , how snugly I nestled against the solid bulk of his body . How hard he was , all over .

I stopped dead in my tracks , disappointment cutting through me like knives . I ’d mistaken her look for one of lust . I ’d obviously been projecting my own feelings onto her , because judging by her wide - eyed , panicked look at my approach , I ’d seriously miscalculated what was happening here . She was just being nice , while I was being a creepy , pervy , wildly inappropriate douchebag who could n’t keep his boner in his pants . What a fucking idiot . “

I would n’t have let her walk anyway , not when I had a car , but she had a blank , stunned look when she came out of the house that made me think she ’d stumble aimlessly around the neighborhood for hours before finally realizing she was lost and lying down in the gutter for a nap . I ’ve seen someone hit in the head with a shovel who had more presence of mind than she was displaying . I held the car door open for her . She inserted herself into the seat with the grace of a zombie , all jerking legs and stiff arms , the opposite of the way she normally moved . “

But not a forbidding , fortress - type castle with dungeons and moats and weird smells . Something elegant and romantic .

Or any castle from any fairy tale where a princess waits for Prince Charming to ride up on his trusty white steed . Then triple the size , add in a herd of white - tailed deer prancing across a lush wilderness backdrop , a glittering lake filled with colored fountains and peacefully drifting swans , and an enormous orange moon cresting over the horizon in the distance , bathing everything in a warm amber glow , and you ’ll have a small glimpse of the magic , majesty , and soul - piercing beauty of the place called Moonstar Ranch .

I used to go there all the time to read and escape all the a THIRTY - ONE JACKSON I knew I was dreaming because the warm , soft , unmistakable curve under my left palm was a woman ’s hip . Dream woman had an incredibly sexy hip . She also smelled delicious and was warm as a little furnace against my chest . All of that helped to distract from the odd fact that I had a headache and my mouth tasted like bourbon . This was a really vivid dream . At least I was lying down comfortably , my head resting on a nice , fluffy pillow , my legs curled up behind dream woman ’s legs . She sighed in sleepy pleasure when I pulled her tighter against me and nuzzled my face into her hair . When I slid my hand over her hip and gently cupped her ass , she sighed again , arching her back and rubbing against my crotch . This was a fucking awesome dream . She smelled like strawberry shampoo and sunshine . Like goodness . Like something I wanted to soak in . . . or taste . I found the nape of her neck with my lips and stroked my tongue over the delicate bump of her spine . She breathed the so THIRTY - TWO BIANCA I ’d seen Jackson ’s scary side .

He took a moment to stare down at me , his eyes black with lust , then he grabbed my sleep shorts and yanked them down my hips . Away they went , flung over to the dresser along with my panties . Kneeling between my spread legs , he made an animal noise as his gaze raked over me . Then his mouth was on my flesh . There . I cried out in shock . His mouth was so hot and wet , so unexpected . He dug his fingers into my hips and thrust his tongue deep inside me . I almost died from pleasure . “

I threaded my shaking fingers into the thick , soft mess of his hair because I needed to feel it .

She was my religion . My north and south , my heaven and earth , the axis of rightness around which everything had suddenly aligned . For the first time in my life , all my polarized parts worked as one , humming happily along in harmony with the universe , finally understanding their place . I surrendered to the feeling completely and without hesitation , knowing that most people would never experience this . This blinding joy . This transcendent bliss .

He stepped in front of me , blocking the spray , and took the bar of soap from my limp hands as I ogled him . Jackson naked was one thing . Jackson naked and wet was something else altogether . Water worshipped his muscles , making all those gorgeous , golden bulges gleam and sparkle like he ’d been photoshopped by a mad , horny housewife . He tipped his head back to wet his hair , and it was in Technicolor slo - mo , a sexy soundtrack playing in the background . I watched with my mouth hanging open as he slowly began to soap his chest . Even Trace had n’t reached this level of physical perfection . I was showering with a Greek god . With art .

13315	13368	13312	13312	he	482	“ Your hostess is incompetent . The music is too loud . And your drink menu is pretentious . ‘ Romeo and Julep ? ’ ‘ The Last of the Mojitos ? ’ Awful . If I were going on first impressions , I ’d guess your food is awful , too . ”
13388	13425	13429	13429	he	487	“ And if I were going on first impressions , I ’d guess you were one of the homeless panhandlers who harass the tourists over on the boulevard , and throw you out of my restaurant . ”

13909	13983	13905	13905	I	0	“ Maybe you were right about the music being too loud . It must have obstructed your hearing , because I just told you that we ’d get you a table as soon as one becomes available . Or perhaps you ’d prefer I throw someone out ? Maybe that nice elderly couple by the piano ? They look much less deserving of enjoying their meal than you do , am I right ? ”

15133	15161	15162	15162	She	56	“ No , it ’s because he ’s stinking rich . And besides , you called him a werewolf . You ca n’t think he ’s handsome ! ”

22684	22709	22710	22710	He	52	“ I doubt Charlie has Bianca Hardwick ’s talent , but she can probably make a sandwich for you and somethin’ appropriate for Cody . ”

22998	23039	23040	23040	He	109	“ Looking forward to it ! The donors are always so keen to see what ’s on the menu . You would n’t believe how seriously this group takes food . The better the food , the better the donations ! ”
23043	23055	23040	23040	He	109	“ Oh — and the wine list ! I completely forgot ! ”

23194	23234	23235	23235	Rayford	52	“ He packed up everything he had — recipe books , notebooks , them fancy Japanese knives — and cleared outta here like a scalded cat . Do n’t expect he ’ll be takin ’ your calls , either , ”

24469	24478	24465	24465	She	74	“ He might have given me another tip . ”
24507	24513	24514	24514	Pepper	74	“ What does he want ? ”
24517	24538	24539	24540	The owner	2388	“ All he said was , and I ’m quoting , ‘ Bring the owner to me . Now . ’ ”

25906	25934	25897	25897	I	0	“ And you look like you were raised in the woods by a tribe of cannibals . All you ’re missing is a bone in your beard . ”
25973	25989	25970	25970	I	0	“ Am I going to have to call the police to get you to leave ? ”
25990	26020	25970	25970	I	0	“ The chief of police and I serve together on the board of the Peace Officers Association . I ’m sure Gavin would be happy to take your call . ”
26031	26040	25970	25970	I	0	“ You enjoy this , do n’t you ? ”
26041	26044	26052	26052	He	62	“ What ? ”
26045	26051	26052	26052	He	62	“ Throwing your weight around . ”
26105	26121	26101	26101	he	62	“ About as much as you enjoy being told what to do , I think . ”
26122	26129	26101	26101	he	62	“ I do n’t take orders . ”
26130	26171	26101	26101	he	62	“ Neither do I. And for the record , I do n’t enjoy throwing my weight around , but every once in a while it ’s the most convenient way to get what I want . And I want you . ”
26182	26190	26191	26191	I	0	“ To come to work for me . ”
26215	26250	26251	26251	He	62	“ I do n’t want to work for you . I do n’t need to work for you . And even if I did , I could n’t . Look around — I’m busy . ”
26277	26373	26251	26251	He	62	“ It ’s a catering job . A onetime thing . I ’m having a benefit dinner and auction at my home for a charity , and I need someone to create the menu and oversee the food and wine for the event . And cook , of course . You ’d be in charge of the entire thing . You can bring in whatever staff you need to assist you . There will be press . A lot of press . I ’d give you and your restaurant full credit in the event materials . ”
26585	26601	26582	26582	I	0	“ I ’m flattered you ’d think of me , but the answer is no . ”
26609	26618	26606	26606	he	756	“ Your fee would be twenty thousand dollars . ”
26638	26647	26628	26628	I	0	“ Tw . . . twenty . . . ”

26824	26854	26820	26821	the Beast	2276	“ Right . The event ’s in two weeks . I ’m having three hundred guests . I need a full menu with wine pairings by this time tomorrow . ”
26860	26877	26820	26821	the Beast	2276	“ Three hundred people ? Two weeks ? Are you kidding me ? That ’s impossible ! ”
26888	26897	26880	26880	I	0	“ No , it ’s twenty thousand dollars . ”
26898	26903	26936	26936	His	761	“ Wait a minute — ”

27114	27121	27111	27111	Eeny	56	“ Your chariot awaits , boo . ”
27261	27289	27258	27258	I	0	“ Please do n’t forget to process the shellfish and get it on ice . And the Nieman Ranch delivery should be here no later than noon . ”
27293	27329	27290	27290	Eeny	56	“ Expectin ’ Carl to be on time with the meat is like expectin ’ to see a gorilla ridin ’ a tricycle down the sidewalk . That boy is slower than a Sunday afternoon . ”
27374	27382	27384	27384	Eeny	56	“ Well off you go , Cinderella , ”
27392	27404	27384	27384	Eeny	56	“ Do n’t want your chariot to turn into a pumpkin ! ”
27405	27418	27419	27419	I	0	“ I ’m glad this is so amusing to you , Eeny , ”
27440	27471	27433	27433	she	56	“ It ’s good for you to get out with a man every once in a while . Keeps the juices flowin ’ , if you know what I mean . ”
27478	27487	27433	27433	she	56	“ This is n’t a date , Eeny . ”
27488	27494	27495	27495	she	56	“ Oh , I know , ”
27499	27535	27536	27536	she	56	“ But judgin ’ by the way Jackson Boudreaux looks at you like you turn his brain to scrambled eggs , it ai n’t all business , either . At least for him . Lawd ! ”
27545	27555	27536	27536	she	56	“ Who ’s that tall drink o ’ water ? ”
27648	27655	27636	27636	She	263	“ Must be Jackson ’s driver . ”
27664	27675	27656	27656	I	0	“ Wonder if he ’s as mean as his boss . ”
27676	27681	27683	27683	Eeny	56	“ Mm - mmm ! ”
27689	27708	27683	27683	Eeny	56	“ He could be meaner’n a drawer of snakes and I ’d still take him for a roll . ”
27749	27754	27746	27746	I	0	“ Thanks for sharing , ”
27766	27772	27773	27773	he	779	“ Mornin ’ , ladies , ”

27858	27868	27869	27869	he	779	“ It ’s a pleasure to meet you both , ”
27881	27949	27869	27869	he	779	“ I must admit , I ’ve been dyin ’ to come in and get a taste of your cookin ’ since you opened , Miss Bianca , but I just have n’t found the time . I was a real big fan of your mama ’s restaurant . And might I say you bear a striking resemblance to your mama , too . Those beautiful cheekbones . ”
27987	28004	27983	27983	anyone	2350	“ Thank you , that ’s a lovely thing to say . Mr. . . . ? ”
28005	28021	28022	28022	He	783	“ Where are my manners ! I ’m Rayford Hayes , Mr. Boudreaux ’s majordomo . ”
28028	28033	28022	28022	He	783	“ At your service . ”
28087	28092	28084	28084	I	0	“ Shall we go ? ”
28093	28100	28101	28101	He	783	“ Yes , ma’am . Eeny . ”

28150	28159	28160	28160	she	789	“ You do the same , Mr. Hayes , ”
28170	28175	28160	28160	she	789	“ Toodle - oo ! ”
28202	28210	28199	28199	he	783	“ Everything all right , Miss Bianca ? ”
28211	28231	28232	28232	He	783	“ Yes , but . . . would it be all right if I rode up front with you ? ”
28236	28240	28232	28232	He	783	“ With me ? ”
28253	28285	28286	28286	Rayford	117	“ It ’s just that I ’m not accustomed to being chauffeured . It seems a little . . . well , let ’s just say it ’s not my style . ”
28295	28306	28307	28307	He	783	“ Why of course . Whatever makes you most comfortable . ”
28324	28329	28321	28321	his	783	“ Right this way . ”
28374	28382	28383	28383	I	0	“ This is a very nice car , ”
28415	28423	28412	28412	Rayford	117	“ You do n’t sound too impressed . ”
28437	28480	28481	28481	Rayford	117	“ I do n’t even own a car . I live six blocks from the restaurant and walk to work every day . I could n’t tell you what kind of car this is if you held a gun to my head . ”
28489	28508	28481	28481	Rayford	117	“ I ’ll be sure not to tell that to Mr. Boudreaux . It might break his heart . ”
28517	28525	28526	28526	I	0	“ Have you worked for him long ? ”
28541	28561	28535	28535	I	0	“ I ’ve worked for his family for most of my life . Known Jackson since he was born . ”
28574	28577	28566	28566	I	0	“ Really ? ”
28581	28622	28566	28566	I	0	“ Went to work for Clemmy and Brig before I even had hair on my chin . Started out in the stables , muckin ’ stalls , worked my way into the laundry , eventually got promoted to the kitchens . ”
28649	28687	28646	28646	he	117	“ From there I learned everything there was to know about runnin ’ a grand house . Though Jackson ’s estate is much smaller than his parents ’ , it ’s still an awful lot of work . ”
28704	28718	28646	28646	he	117	“ So how did you come to be with him in New Orleans ? ”
28734	28744	28724	28724	Rayford	117	“ That ’s not my story to tell , Miss. ”
28768	28799	28800	28800	He	117	“ Got it . Sorry . My mama ’s always telling me I talk too much . Says my gift of the gab is a shade closer to a curse . ”
28811	28850	28800	28800	He	117	“ How is your mama , anyway ? I did n’t know her well , just an occasional customer like I said , but I was real sorry to hear about what happened to her restaurant during Katrina . ”

29083	29126	29078	29078	Rayford	117	“ Rivendell ’s got ten bedrooms , twelve bathrooms , and over fifteen thousand square feet on a five - acre lot . Jackson bought up the property on both sides and tore down the houses so he could have more privacy . ”
29134	29149	29130	29130	Rayford	117	“ Rivendell ? The house is named after the elven realm in The Hobbit ? ”

29212	29250	29201	29201	He	117	“ My father used to always read to me before bed when I was little . I guess I fell in love with books way back then , and it ’s been an ongoing affair ever since . ”

29268	29282	29265	29265	Rayford	117	“ I swear we ’ve got more books than the Library of Congress . ”
29442	29456	29457	29457	Rayford	117	“ You ’re lookin ’ a little spooked over there , Miss Bianca . ”
29462	29466	29457	29457	Rayford	117	“ You okay ? ”
29467	29474	29475	29475	I	0	“ Fine as frog ’s hair ! ”

30104	30111	30113	30113	Rayford	117	“ You get used to it , ”
30115	30158	30113	30113	Rayford	117	“ The heat ’s always on , but marble ’s real stubborn about warmin ’ up , and this time of year we get a cold breeze comin ’ off the water , which does n’t help . The kitchen ’s better . ”

30531	30537	30538	30538	He	842	“ Interesting ? Not pretentious ? ”
30569	30580	30566	30566	He	842	“ It ’s only pretentious if you ’re faking it . ”
30594	30602	30581	30581	He	842	“ So the classics are your favorite ? ”
30651	30660	30661	30661	I	0	“ The classics were my father ’s favorites , ”
30665	30676	30661	30661	I	0	“ I created the cocktail menu in honor of him . ”

30792	30795	30797	30797	Rayford	117	“ Well , ”

30834	30857	30831	30831	he	117	“ Mr. Boudreaux has n’t apologized to anyone in as long as I can remember . Today must be your lucky day . ”

31061	31073	31074	31074	Jackson	54	“ The side patio will be used for a staging area , ”
31097	31136	31074	31074	Jackson	54	“ The south lawn will be tented and set up with the dining tables . The silent auction is scheduled to begin at four with cocktails and passed hors d’oeuvres , and the dinner seating begins at six . ”

31175	31220	31172	31172	He	117	“ She ’s got all the rentals already covered , including china , glassware , linens , tables , all of it . Everything will be set the day before , so there should be no one in your way when you get started . ”
31236	31249	31172	31172	He	117	“ I ’ll need to talk to her about the buffet setup — ”
31250	31257	31258	31258	he	117	“ It ’s not a buffet , ”
31261	31267	31258	31258	he	117	“ Dinner will be served . ”

31717	31720	31711	31711	he	866	“ Explain . ”
31730	31760	31727	31727	I	0	“ When I told you I loved your family ’s bourbon , it was the truth . There ’s a good reason it ’s the world ’s bestselling spirit — ”
31761	31770	31771	31771	Jackson	54	“ Yes . Millions of dollars of marketing , ”
31785	31800	31774	31774	I	0	“ No . It ’s because it ’s the best bourbon money can buy . ”
31810	31831	31806	31806	he	866	“ You already have the job , Miss Hardwick . You do n’t have to blow smoke up my ass . ”
31838	31874	31835	31835	I	0	“ I never blow smoke into anyone ’s orifices , Mr. Boudreaux . Your bourbon is the best , or I would n’t put it in my food and serve it to my blasted customers ! ”
31981	31989	31995	31995	his	866	“ Look . All this food I ’ve proposed”—I
31996	32020	31995	31995	his	866	hands—“was chosen specifically because it would pair well with and highlight the unique aspects of the various lines of bourbon that you sell . ”
32021	32027	32028	32028	he	866	“ That my family sells , ”
32069	32073	32074	32074	I	0	“ Excuse me , ”
32078	32203	32074	32074	I	0	“ That your family sells . My idea was that since you were putting on this event , as opposed to Joe Billionaire whose family makes urinal cakes , it would be nice to showcase the artistry and craftsmanship of your family ’s products . I think it would be a real treat for your guests , make it more personal . I mean , if you ’re going to all this trouble to make this event special , why not dazzle them with all the bells and whistles ? Show them what the Boudreaux family name stands for . Show them what two hundred years of perfecting the craft of distilling tastes like . Give ’em the steak , not just the sizzle ! ”
32234	32237	32238	32238	he	866	“ Christ , ”
32248	32255	32238	32238	he	866	“ would my father love you . ”
32277	32315	32322	32322	he	866	“ With the passed hors d’oeuvres , we ’ll start with a sparkling prosecco - based cocktail featuring the silver - label bourbon . It ’s called an Old Cuban . . . you ’ll love it . ”
32336	32424	32332	32332	I	0	“ And we ’ll have a classic mojito using Boudreaux Special Select white rum , which will pair wonderfully with the first course . The main course features braised beef , which will be delicious with the black label — all that smoky , muscular character will really bring out the flavors in the meat — and for dessert we can make a Honey - Hattan with the honey bourbon to pair with the ginger - orange cheesecake . My mouth is watering just thinking of it ! ”
32447	32461	32444	32444	he	866	“ You actually do love my family ’s bourbon , do n’t you ? ”
32476	32481	32444	32444	he	866	“ Do n’t you ? ”
32496	32509	32486	32486	his	866	“ Sure , the same way I love getting a root canal . ”
32536	32635	32532	32532	Rayford	117	“ Mr. Boudreaux , I know what I ’m doing . It ’s really difficult to pair cocktails with food , especially through an entire meal , which is another thing that ’s going to make it so special . I ’ll bet good money that none of your guests has ever had a curated bourbon pairing with a four - course dinner . Trust me . It ’s going to be fantastic . And the better they think it is , the bigger they ’ll open their wallets . Which is really the whole point , right ? ”
32668	32673	32674	32674	he	866	“ Call me Jackson , ”
32687	32703	32684	32684	I	0	“ If I wanted to call you Jackson , I would have , Mr. Boudreaux . ”

32722	32749	32718	32718	he	866	“ In my defense , I ’d had a terrible day when we first met . I might have been a little more blunt than usual . ”
32753	32800	32750	32750	I	0	“ Blunt ? Try tactless ! Try rude ! And by the way , other people have bad days all the time and do n’t turn into high - and - mighty mood monsters and start insulting everyone in sight . It ’s called common courtesy . ”
32820	32838	32816	32816	He	866	“ If you were mine , I ’d take you over my knee for that little speech . ”

36528	36578	36523	36523	Eeny	56	“ Ugh . That was a whole other disaster . Remind me to have a shot of liquor before I talk to Jackson Boudreaux again . Maybe he ’ll make sense if I ’m tipsy . But I was n’t talking about him . I was talking about Trace . ”
36617	36632	36608	36608	she	56	“ Trace ! Lawd ! What on earth you doin’ talkin ’ to him ? ”
36633	36643	36644	36644	I	0	“ Believe me , it was n’t my idea . ”
36666	36703	36704	36704	I	0	“ Well what did he say ? More importantly , how did he look ? Does he still have all those big ol’ muscles in all the right places , or did he let himself go ? ”
36707	36723	36704	36704	I	0	“ The day Trace Adams lets himself go is the day the earth stops spinning . ”
36724	36736	36737	36737	I	0	“ So he looked good ? What was he wearin ’ ? ”
36746	36769	36737	36737	I	0	“ Eeny . Focus . The man is a liar and a cheater . It does n’t matter how good he looks . ”
36775	36804	36772	36772	her	56	“ Can you just tell me if he was wearin ’ those tight jeans like he always used to that accentuated his nice big package and tight butt ? ”
36816	36827	36805	36805	I	0	“ No . He was wearing a pair of sweatpants . ”
36997	37000	37002	37002	Eeny	56	“ Sweatpants ! ”
37014	37033	37004	37004	She	56	“ Lawd , what a waste . That ’s like hangin ’ curtains on the statue of David . ”
37249	37264	37265	37265	Mama	64	“ Buck up , child , you look like you ’re at a funeral ! ”
37280	37285	37265	37265	Mama	64	“ I ’m sorry . ”
37296	37324	37325	37327	A male nurse	957	“ You ’re right . What can I do for you ? Can I get you anything ? Water ? A snack ? Something else to read ? ”
37353	37370	37350	37350	Mama	64	“ Hoo ! There ’s my snack right there . You think he likes older women ? ”
37376	37387	37388	37388	She	64	“ I think those chemicals are going to your head . ”
37394	37407	37408	37408	I	0	“ Are you saying you do n’t think I could hit that ? ”
37411	37421	37408	37408	I	0	“ Hit that ? Are you a rapper now ? ”
37427	37457	37458	37458	She	64	“ If I were , I ’d want to be Jay Z. Married to Beyoncé , can you imagine ? That boy has no idea how lucky he is ! ”
37469	37493	37458	37458	She	64	“ And if he does n’t watch out , Kanye West is gon na get all up in there and steal his woman . ”
37499	37517	37497	37497	her	64	“ I ’d ask if you ’ve been drinking , but I ’m afraid of the answer . ”
37518	37523	37524	37524	she	64	“ Speaking of drinking , ”
37544	37556	37524	37524	she	64	“ I got a real interesting phone call the other day . ”
37557	37560	37561	37561	I	0	“ Oh ? ”
37607	37612	37614	37614	Mama	64	“ Mmm - hmm , ”
37616	37620	37614	37614	Mama	64	“ From Trace . ”
37635	37642	37614	37614	Mama	64	“ Trace ! You ’re joking ! ”
37643	37654	37655	37655	She	64	“ I ’m serious as a car crash , chère . ”
37670	37680	37661	37661	her	64	“ Why did n’t you mention you saw him ? ”
37681	37691	37692	37692	I	0	“ Because I was trying to forget , obviously , ”
37695	37708	37692	37692	I	0	“ And what business did he have calling you ? The nerve ! ”
37709	37727	37728	37728	She	64	“ Oh , do n’t you worry , I gave him a good piece of my mind . ”
37736	37753	37728	37728	She	64	“ Funny , he agreed with everything I said about him . And then he apologized . ”
37759	37788	37754	37754	I	0	“ Oh , Mama , you know better than to listen to that snake oil salesman . You should ’ve hung up the second you recognized his voice . ”
37789	37793	37794	37794	she	64	“ I did , ”
37799	37820	37794	37794	she	64	“ Until he called me back and told me that losing you was the biggest mistake he ’d ever made . ”
37821	37824	37825	37825	I	0	“ Gag , ”
37828	37840	37825	37825	I	0	“ And that he ’d do anything to get you back . ”
37841	37850	37794	37794	she	64	“ Oh , for the love of God . ”
37851	37858	37825	37825	I	0	“ Which was his other point . ”
37864	37884	37859	37859	I	0	“ Please do n’t tell me you believe his whole ‘ I ’ve been saved by Jesus ’ spiel ! ”
37905	37927	37900	37900	she	64	“ For some people , hitting rock bottom is the only way they can start a new journey toward the top . ”
37928	37958	37900	37900	she	64	“ Rock bottom ! He ’s a ho , Mama , not an alcoholic ! Land ’s sake , he slept with my best friend ! In my bed ! ”
37987	38019	37982	37982	Mama	64	“ I know he did , baby , and that was an awful thing to do . All I ’m saying is . . . occasionally good people make stupid mistakes . ”
38025	38061	38020	38020	Her	64	“ And honestly , lately I ’ve been thinking a lot about all the mistakes I ’ve made in my life . Sometimes it takes something really bad to put all the good in perspective . ”
38062	38066	38067	38067	I	0	“ Sweet Jesus , ”
38074	38083	38067	38067	I	0	“ He ’s put a spell on you . ”
38093	38113	38084	38084	She	64	“ Nobody ’s put a spell on me . I ’m too thick - headed for it to work . ”
38128	38181	38114	38114	She	64	“ But after sixty - four years on this earth , I know when a man ’s lying , and I know when a man ’s telling the truth . And when Trace said he still loved you and would do anything to get you back , he was telling the truth . ”
38189	38238	38182	38182	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe we ’re having this conversation . You saw how devastated I was after we broke up . You remember how much weight I lost and how I cried every day and how I could n’t get out of bed for weeks , right ? ”
38239	38243	38244	38244	she	961	“ I remember , ”
38248	38280	38244	38244	she	961	“ But I also know you have n’t even looked at another man since him . Which makes me think all those feelings you had for him might still be there . ”
38287	38302	38303	38303	She	961	“ Oh , no . Please tell me you did n’t tell him that . ”
38324	38331	38332	38332	She	961	“ Mama ! You did n’t ! ”
38343	38372	38336	38336	her	961	“ Do n’t you raise your voice to me , young lady . I am not gon na leave this earth without seeing you settled , you hear ? ”
38373	38380	38381	38381	I	0	“ You ’re not going anywhere ! ”
38396	38489	38391	38391	She	961	“ And I ’m gon na tell you something else — your own daddy was n’t the saint you think he was . Before we were married that man chased every skirt he saw , and when I found out , I left him flat as a penny run over by a freight train . But he begged me to forgive him , and I ’m glad I did because we were happily married for more than thirty years and he gave me the best gift I ’ve ever gotten — you . ”
38503	38644	38500	38500	She	962	“ Men are n’t like us , baby . They ’re dumb as doughnut holes when it comes to love . But once they decide to commit — not say they ’re committing , but deep in their heart actually make the commitment — they never waver . Your father did n’t waver for thirty years , even when his own parents cut him off without a cent because he married me . He did n’t waver when we found out I could n’t have any more babies , even though he wanted a big family . He did n’t waver through good times or bad , sickness or health , for all the years after he took a vow to love and cherish me . In the end the only thing powerful enough to put us apart was death . ”
38650	38780	38645	38645	Her	963	“ And sometimes I ’m not sure that did it , either . I can still feel him when I ’m low . Every once in a while I smell his cologne , even when I ’m in a room all by myself . Just this morning I rolled over in bed and felt a hand on my forehead , but when I opened my eyes there was no one there . I do n’t know what that means , but I do know this . If your father , God rest his soul , could turn out to be the honest man and true friend and loyal husband he was for all those years , chère , there ’s hope for anyone . Even a scallywag like Trace . ”
38799	38809	38796	38796	I	0	“ You never told me any of that before . ”
38825	38833	38810	38810	She	964	“ I ’ve never been dying before . ”
38834	38840	38841	38841	I	0	“ You ’re not dying , ”
38848	38864	38865	38865	She	964	“ We ’re all dying , baby . It ’s just a matter of when . ”
38876	38906	38865	38865	She	964	“ I ’ve had a wonderful life . Maybe better than I deserve . I ’m not afraid to go , so do n’t you be afraid , either . ”
38913	38928	38907	38907	I	0	“ How can you not be afraid ? I ’m so afraid for you . ”
38937	38952	38953	38953	she	964	“ Because your daddy ’s waiting for me on the other side , baby , ”
38957	38975	38953	38953	she	964	“ Finally we ’ll be together again . Being afraid of that would just be plain stupid . ”
38990	38999	39000	39000	she	964	“ Oh , come on now , chère , ”
39034	39069	39017	39017	She	964	“ You always were such a sentimental little thing . Crying over dead goldfish and those Morris the Cat commercials where he ’s lost and his owner ’s looking for him in the rain . ”
39076	39083	39017	39017	She	964	“ You ’re not a goldfish ! ”
39089	39176	39084	39084	Her	964	“ Might as well be . We ’re all just here for a blip in time , riding on a rock that ’s flying through space at a million miles a day in a galaxy that has a hundred billion stars . Me , Jay Z , the president , a goldfish . . . in the end there ’s not much difference , chère . We come and go . We live and die . If we ’re lucky , we love and are loved . ”
39193	39214	39177	39177	She	964	“ And I ’ve been incredibly lucky , so do n’t you waste your tears on me , you hear ? ”
39226	39231	39177	39177	She	964	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
39232	39236	39237	39237	She	964	“ Good girl . ”
39248	39271	39243	39243	Her	964	“ Now where the heck is that male nurse ? I feel in need of some mouth - to - mouth resuscitation ! ”
39636	39640	39642	39643	Doc Halloran	68	“ Perfectly normal , ”
39653	39672	39648	39648	him	2302	“ It ’s a sign the medicine is working , Bianca . Just let it take its course . ”
40013	40025	40027	40027	Claudia	142	“ So we ’re all set with the canapés and cocktails , ”
40048	40081	40027	40027	Claudia	142	“ The musicians are warming up on the lawn . In thirty minutes I ’ll light all the candles , and fifteen minutes after that the guests are scheduled to start arriving . ”
40094	40105	40082	40082	She	142	“ Do you need anything from me at this point ? ”
40111	40122	40082	40082	She	142	“ No , thanks . I ’m all set here . ”
40123	40126	40127	40127	Claudia	142	“ Good . ”
40133	40160	40127	40127	Claudia	142	“ I ’ll check in with you again in fifty minutes . If you need me , I ’m on my headset . The number ’s — ”
40161	40166	40167	40167	I	0	“ On the schedule , ”
40170	40174	40167	40167	I	0	“ I know . ”
40279	40287	40288	40288	Jackson	54	“ Ladies . How ’re we doing ? ”
40327	40333	40334	40334	I	0	“ Everything ’s under control , ”
40337	40345	40334	40334	I	0	“ Claudia ’s doing a great job . ”
40419	40429	40415	40415	I	0	“ Is that what you ’re going to wear ? ”
40468	40474	40475	40475	she	142	“ Fifty minutes , Bianca ! ”
40501	40511	40498	40498	He	987	“ What ’s wrong with what I ’m wearing ? ”
40515	40532	40498	40498	He	987	“ Nothing , if you want people to think you ’ve been living under a bridge . ”
40558	40572	40555	40555	He	987	“ You must be mistaking me for someone who cares what people think . ”
40630	40672	40627	40627	I	0	“ Lord knows I ’m no style maven , and I dress for comfort more than anything else , but your guests deserve the best version of you , Mr. Boudreaux . I ’m sorry to say this is n’t it . ”
40735	40740	40742	40742	Jackson	54	“ Oh , really ? ”
40748	40753	40742	40742	Jackson	54	“ Yes , really . ”
40783	40794	40780	40780	He	987	“ So what would you recommend I wear , then ? ”
40795	40802	40803	40803	His	987	“ Do you own a suit ? ”
40809	40814	40803	40803	His	987	“ I hate suits . ”
40815	40822	40824	40824	he	987	“ But do you have one ? ”
40855	40867	40852	40852	I	0	“ That ’s what you should wear . With a tie . ”
40874	40879	40880	40880	He	987	“ And dress shoes . ”
40912	40922	40909	40909	I	0	“ Also , a shave would n’t kill you . ”
40933	40940	40941	40941	He	987	“ You do n’t like beards . ”
40952	40972	40978	40978	he	987	“ Beards are fine . But that thing carpeting your jaw ? Honestly , I ’ve seen tidier jungles . ”
41012	41022	41009	41009	He	987	“ You ’re in fine form today , Bianca . ”
41046	41051	41052	41052	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
41067	41078	41052	41052	I	0	“ You ’re right . It ’s just . . . ”
41084	41094	41079	41079	I	0	“ It ’s just been a rough few weeks . ”
41107	41112	41113	41113	he	987	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
41183	41194	41180	41180	I	0	“ Just some personal stuff . My mother . . . ”
41298	41302	41303	41303	he	987	“ Your mother ? ”
41319	41352	41307	41307	I	0	“ It ’s nothing . I ’m so sorry , I ’m being unprofessional . If you do n’t mind , Mr. Boudreaux , I ’ll just get back to work now — ”
41353	41356	41357	41357	he	987	“ Jackson , ”
41375	41386	41369	41369	His	987	“ I want you to call me Jackson , Bianca . ”
41414	41421	41410	41410	I	0	“ Um . . . okay . ”
41574	41577	41562	41562	I	0	“ Bianca ! ”
41628	41635	41625	41625	I	0	“ What ? What ’s happening ? ”
41645	41663	41636	41636	She	142	“ Mr. Boudreaux asked for you . He ’s in the tent . You ’d better hurry . ”
41747	41771	41744	41744	I	0	“ In the tent ? Why would he want me in the tent ? Is n’t the auction supposed to be starting now ? ”
41797	41814	41772	41772	Claudia	142	“ Six minutes ago ! Which is why you need to hurry ! Go ! Now ! ”
41832	41842	41828	41828	I	0	“ Well hold your horses , I ’m going ! ”
41843	41846	41847	41847	she	142	“ Quickly ! ”
42021	42027	42018	42018	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
42028	42035	42036	42036	She	142	“ Get up to the stage . ”
42088	42092	42093	42093	I	0	“ The stage ? ”
42096	42099	42093	42093	I	0	“ Why ? ”
42109	42130	42131	42131	I	0	“ Like anybody tells me anything ! All I know is you ’re supposed to get up there right now . ”
42134	42139	42131	42131	I	0	“ But the schedule — ”
42222	42230	42231	42231	he	1019	“ Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ”
42234	42240	42231	42231	he	1019	“ I ’m Jackson Boudreaux . ”
42298	42306	42307	42307	Jackson	54	“ Thank you so much for coming , ”
42313	42324	42307	42307	Jackson	54	“ I ’m honored to welcome you to my home . ”
42489	42522	42546	42546	he	147	“ As you may know , I first became involved with the Wounded Warrior Project after my best friend , Christian LeFevre , was wounded while serving in the Marines in Afghanistan . ”
42550	42609	42546	42546	he	147	“ A roadside bomb took Christian ’s legs but not his love of his country , his joy for life , or his dedication to serving others . Though complications from his amputations ultimately claimed his life , the Wounded Warrior Project was there for him in his final months the way no other organization could have been . ”
42730	42843	42727	42727	Jackson	147	“ In the four years since Christian ’s death , I ’ve witnessed firsthand how many lives this organization has touched . How many lives it has changed for the better . How many lives it has saved . This nation and all its citizens owe a great debt to the brave men and women who serve in our military . But the greatest debt of all is to those who are wounded or have fallen in combat . Those who so valiantly and selflessly volunteer to defend us and our allies around the world , and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom , must never be forgotten . ”
42857	42877	42853	42853	he	147	“ It ’s through the efforts of organizations like the Wounded Warrior Project that we ensure they never are . ”
42923	42952	42920	42920	Jackson	147	“ Coming up next we ’re going to start the auction . I ’m sure you ’ll all be very generous to help our wounded vets , right ? ”
42994	43030	42991	42991	He	147	“ But before we get to that , I want to introduce you to the woman who made you all the delicious food you ’ve been eating this evening . Chef , join me onstage . ”
43522	43534	43535	43535	he	147	“ Pretend like you do n’t hate me , and smile , ”
43551	43554	43535	43535	he	147	“ Please . ”
43603	43639	43596	43596	Jackson	54	“ I discovered the magic of Bianca Hardwick ’s cuisine when I visited her restaurant in the French Quarter . The food was so good I stayed all night and tried everything on the menu — ”
43640	43651	43653	43656	someone from the audience	1046	“ Maybe it was n’t the food you stayed for ! ”
43705	43719	43702	43702	He	1050	“ Well . Maybe for the first hour it was for the food . ”
43825	43849	43822	43822	Jackson	54	“ I want y’ all to visit Bianca ’s in the Quarter before month ’s end . Will you do that for me ? ”
43921	43933	43914	43914	he	1050	“ You can stop smiling now , for Christ ’s sake ! ”
43934	43939	43940	43940	I	0	“ Oh thank heavens , ”
43944	43966	43967	43967	He	1050	“ For a minute there I thought I was living in an alternate universe where you actually had a good side . ”
44016	44060	44013	44013	He	1050	“ You ’re right . I do n’t have a good side . The person I was in there is a fabrication , the Jackson Boudreaux who likes people and enjoys the spotlight and feels right at home in a fucking penguin suit . ”
44073	44101	44102	44102	He	1050	“ But that guy knows how to work a crowd and raise money by the fuckload for a charity that helps a lot of soldiers in need . ”
44108	44164	44102	44102	He	1050	“ And that guy is willing to do whatever ’s necessary to keep his end of a bargain with you and promote your restaurant and act like we ’re on good terms , even when it ’s painfully fucking obvious you ’d rather be pushed off a building than have my arm around your shoulders ! ”
44239	44267	44236	44236	I	0	“ Just to be clear , I would rather have your arm around me than be pushed off a building . That is definitely preferable to death . ”
44307	44361	44304	44304	I	0	“ Also to be clear , I do n’t hate you . You said that earlier , but it ’s not true . What I feel when I ’m around you is usually irritation , I admit that , but only because you ’re always acting like you just escaped from a zoo . ”
44400	44418	44392	44392	his	1050	“ And even if that was an act in there , I admire that you would do all this”—I
44441	44460	44392	44392	his	1050	equipment—“in memory of your friend who passed away . And to raise money to help others like him . ”
44522	44548	44519	44519	I	0	“ And to shave and wear a penguin suit and say such nice things about my restaurant , even if you did n’t mean it . ”
44553	44568	44549	44549	He	1050	“ If I did n’t mean it , you would n’t be standing here . ”
44625	44698	44622	44622	I	0	“ I ’m not comfortable in front of large crowds . That ’s why I was stiff . I was surprised that you put your arm around me and that you were acting so differently , so that contributed to my general weirdness , too , but to be honest I was also very moved by what you said about your friend and had n’t quite recovered when you called me up . ”
44708	44719	44705	44705	I	0	“ That part was n’t an act , was it ? ”
44728	44755	44723	44723	He	1066	“ I loved Christian like a brother . We went to college together . That ’s why I adopted Cody . He ’s Christian ’s son . ”
44977	45004	44974	44974	I	0	“ Well if you ’ll excuse me , I have to get back to work before Claudia discovers I ’m still gone and has a stroke . ”
45252	45271	45249	45249	He	1084	“ Since you like Boudreaux Bourbon so much , I thought you might want to try something special . ”
45300	45305	45272	45272	He	1084	“ Heritage 30 Year . ”
45310	45320	45321	45321	Jackson	54	“ I thought that stuff was an urban legend ! ”
45406	45496	45403	45403	He	1084	“ It ’s an orphan from one of only a few dozen barrels made with this particular mash bill . An experiment that was ended when my father opened the barrels after ten years and declared it shit . The rest of the barrels were sold to a competitor for blending , but one was misplaced , found in the back of the rickhouse a few years ago . Turns out the mash bill was perfect , but it needed a lot longer to age than the other recipes . ”
45611	45618	45590	45590	He	1091	“ Tell me what you smell . ”
45686	45691	45683	45683	I	0	“ I smell heaven . ”
45704	45718	45700	45700	he	1091	“ I thought heaven was a library filled with every book ever written . ”
45732	45752	45726	45726	I	0	“ You have to have something good to drink while you ’re reading a good book , Mr. Boudreaux . ”
45802	45805	45792	45792	He	1091	“ Jackson . ”
45829	45836	45824	45824	I	0	“ Right . Jackson . Sorry . ”
45837	45847	45848	45848	he	1091	“ Have I said something to offend you again ? ”
45854	45859	45851	45851	I	0	“ No . Why ? ”
45867	45878	45851	45851	I	0	“ Because your face gets flushed when you ’re mad . ”
45879	45883	45884	45884	I	0	“ Or embarrassed , ”
45887	45918	45884	45884	I	0	“ I get it from my father ’s side . You could always tell when he was feeling something strong because his cheeks would go red as Rudolph ’s nose . ”
45953	45971	45950	45950	he	1091	“ Why would you be embarrassed that I told you to call me by my first name ? ”
46063	46066	46067	46067	I	0	“ Whew ! ”
46074	46082	46083	46083	Jackson	54	“ That possum ’s on the stump ! ”
46089	46101	46086	46086	his	1091	“ It means it does n’t get any better than that , ”
46116	46135	46113	46113	Jackson	54	“ I know what it means . I ’m just wondering what ’s got you so riled up . ”
46152	46171	46149	46149	I	0	“ I — I’m uh . . . tired . I get kinda loopy when I ’m tired . ”
46357	46360	46361	46361	I	0	“ Smooth , ”
46382	46389	46379	46379	He	1091	“ Do I make you uncomfortable ? ”
46435	46450	46428	46428	I	0	“ Have you seen Rayford anywhere ? He said he ’d drive me home . ”
46451	46487	46490	46490	he	1091	“ No . And that was the worst segue I ’ve ever heard . So I have to assume the answer to the question you avoided is yes . My next question is , why ? ”
46497	46511	46494	46494	I	0	“ You ’ve made me uncomfortable since the first moment I met you , ”
46530	46547	46527	46527	I	0	“ But tonight ’s the first time that it ’s not a bad kind of uncomfortable . ”
46571	46581	46568	46568	he	1091	“ What kind of uncomfortable is it , Bianca ? ”
46787	46793	46800	46800	she	60	“ I should be going , ”
46903	46907	46908	46908	I	0	“ Of course , ”
46913	46924	46908	46908	I	0	“ It ’s late . I wo n’t keep you . ”
46952	46966	46949	46949	Bianca	60	“ Rayford was supposed to drive me home , but I have n’t — ”
46967	46973	46974	46974	It	1116	“ I ’ll take you ! ”
46996	46999	47000	47000	she	60	“ Oh , ”
47003	47016	47000	47000	she	60	“ Um . . . I do n’t want to bother you . ”
47017	47024	47025	47025	I	0	“ It ’s not a bother , ”
47110	47114	47115	47115	I	0	“ This way , ”
47393	47396	47390	47390	I	0	“ Seatbelt . ”
47481	47496	47477	47477	Bianca	60	“ That ’s quite a car collection you ’ve got . I counted twelve ? ”
47497	47507	47508	47508	I	0	“ I have to spend my money on something , ”
47560	47568	47557	47557	Bianca	60	“ Why are you mad right now ? ”
47594	47635	47591	47591	She	60	“ You ’re driving like a crazy person , and I ’m not ready to die yet , so maybe if you told me why you ’re so angry , we could talk about it and you ’d slow down . ”
47639	47645	47636	47636	I	0	“ I ’m not angry ! ”
47683	47686	47680	47680	she	60	“ Okay . ”
47690	47693	47687	47687	I	0	“ Fuck . ”
47704	47709	47697	47697	my	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
47752	47761	47749	47749	I	0	“ I ’m not very good with people . ”
47767	47776	47762	47762	Her	60	“ You are when you want to be . ”
47822	47828	47819	47819	I	0	“ Where am I going ? ”
47829	47836	47837	47837	We	1140	“ Tremé . Saint Ann Street . ”
47871	47878	47863	47863	she	60	“ I want to thank you . ”
47879	47883	47863	47863	she	60	“ For what ? ”
47884	47897	47863	47863	she	60	“ For overpaying me . It came at exactly the right time . ”
47910	47964	47904	47904	I	0	“ You were n’t overpaid . You saved my ass . No one else could ’ve pulled tonight off on such short notice . And the food was incredible . You were right , people opened their wallets . It looks like the auction will be the most successful the Project has had . ”
47980	47988	47977	47977	her	60	“ Well , anyway . Thank you . ”
48021	48033	48018	48018	I	0	“ What do you mean it came at the right time ? ”
48039	48059	48034	48034	She	60	“ Nothing , just . . . it ’s appreciated . You were very generous . It really helped . ”
48087	48094	48078	48078	She	60	“ Is this about your mother ? ”
48110	48119	48100	48100	She	60	“ How did you know about my mother ? ”
48126	48142	48143	48143	Bianca	60	“ You mentioned her earlier . You said it had been a rough few weeks . ”
48152	48157	48148	48148	I	0	“ Is she sick ? ”
48170	48211	48158	48158	She	60	“ She would literally kill me if she knew I told you , so I ’m not telling you . But yes . But you did n’t hear that from me , and please do n’t share it with anyone . ”
48243	48255	48239	48239	I	0	“ You have my word I wo n’t tell a soul . ”
48265	48283	48256	48256	She	60	“ Thank you . It ’s been really hard not having anyone to talk to about it . ”
48353	48364	48350	48350	I	0	“ My mother ’s been sick for a long time . ”
48371	48387	48365	48365	Bianca	60	“ Really ? Oh , no ! Is it . . . is it bad ? ”
48405	48429	48393	48393	I	0	“ She had a stroke several years ago . She mainly stays in bed now . Has trouble speaking , needs constant care . ”
48447	48452	48454	48454	Bianca	60	“ Oh , Jackson , ”
48456	48473	48454	48454	Bianca	60	“ I ’m so sorry to hear that . How hard it must be for you ! ”
48486	48494	48482	48482	she	60	“ Or are you two not close ? ”
48539	48555	48515	48515	Bianca	60	“ We used to be . But that was before I became such a disappointment . ”
48556	48569	48603	48603	she	60	“ A disappointment ? You ? But you ’re so . . . ”
48606	48649	48603	48603	she	60	“ Well I do n’t know what the right word is , but anyone who adopts a special - needs child and raises money for charity and keeps his end of the deals he makes is n’t a disappointment in my book . ”
48656	48670	48603	48603	she	60	“ Even if you are stuck - up higher than a light pole . ”
48671	48681	48682	48682	I	0	“ Stuck up ! I am not stuck up ! ”
48711	48730	48703	48703	Bianca	60	“ Oh please , Jackson , you ’re so highfalutin , you think your shit tastes like sherbet . ”
48754	48764	48765	48765	she	60	“ Oh my goodness , I ’m so sorry , ”
48768	48776	48765	48765	she	60	“ That was just classless and rude . ”
48813	48831	48810	48810	She	60	“ Please tell me you ’re not going to put a retroactive stop payment on your check ! ”
48832	48840	48841	48841	I	0	“ That ’s not even a thing , ”
48858	48878	48848	48848	She	60	“ If my mother knew I ’d said something like that , she ’d knock me into next week . ”
48894	48922	48886	48886	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about it . You ’ve been giving me grief since the minute we met . I think I ’m starting to like it . ”
48954	48957	48958	48958	I	0	“ Sorry , ”
48977	48981	48974	48974	she	60	“ Turn here . ”

49061	49064	49057	49057	Bianca	60	“ Oh ! ”
49163	49167	49159	49159	I	0	“ Your boyfriend ? ”
49181	49192	49175	49175	She	60	“ Ex - boyfriend . So very , very ex . ”
49255	49263	49264	49264	I	0	“ I ’ll get rid of him , ”
49278	49281	49282	49282	She	60	“ No . ”

49516	49529	49530	49530	I	0	“ Did you just kiss me to try to make him jealous ? ”
49533	49536	49530	49530	I	0	“ Um . ”
49586	49614	49583	49583	he	52	“ You caught me off guard . Let ’s try it again . And this time put your hand on my chest so it looks more authentic . ”
49618	49625	49583	49583	he	52	“ Lord , you ’re bossy — ”
49772	49789	49769	49769	He	52	“ God , I hope you have a lot of exes you want to make jealous . ”
49826	49833	49823	49823	I	0	“ Only the one , unfortunately . ”
49847	49850	49834	49834	He	52	“ Unfortunately ? ”
49876	49895	49867	49867	Trace	71	“ Uh , Bianca ? You gon na sit out here all night or are you coming in ? ”
49927	49941	49924	49924	I	0	“ It ’s none of your business what I do , Trace Adams ! ”
49945	49956	49942	49942	Trace	71	“ I need to talk to you , bumble bee . ”
49961	49972	49957	49957	Jackson	52	“ Do you want to talk to him , Bianca ? ”
49973	49982	49983	49983	Trace	71	“ No ! Not now , not ever ! ”
49986	49998	49983	49983	Trace	71	“ Of course you do . You ’re just being stubborn . ”
50019	50024	50011	50011	I	0	“ Uh - oh . ”
50037	50067	50032	50032	Jackson	52	“ You have ten seconds to get the fuck away from that window before I make you a fist sandwich and shove it down your throat , my friend . ”
50105	50124	50125	50125	Jackson	52	“ I do n’t know who you are , asshole , but nobody talks to me like that . ”
50128	50137	50125	50125	Jackson	52	“ And nobody calls me ‘ asshole . ’ ”
50138	50141	50143	50143	Trace	71	“ Oh , ”
50145	50165	50143	50143	Trace	71	“ ai n’t you an asshole ? Because from where I ’m standing , you sure look like one . ”
50172	50198	50169	50169	Jackson	52	“ And from where I ’m standing , you ’re looking like you ’re one dumb remark away from a visit to the emergency room . ”
50249	50269	50270	50270	Trace	71	“ Excuse me , person who claims to have found God , but your ratty old soul is showing ! ”
50274	50278	50270	50270	Trace	71	“ Bumble bee — ”
50279	50311	50314	50314	his	71	“ Do n’t you ‘ bumble bee ’ me ! I told you the last time I saw you to leave me alone ! I never want to see you again ! ”
50350	50357	50347	50347	He	71	“ Your mama told me different . ”
50389	50404	50386	50386	I	0	“ Just because trash can be recycled does n’t mean you deserve another chance . ”
50433	50436	50437	50437	he	71	“ Fine , ”
50440	50471	50437	50437	he	71	“ I can see you ’re not going to be reasonable in front the asshole . So why do n’t you give me a call when he is n’t around . ”
50537	50540	50541	50541	I	0	“ Ooh , ”
50548	50552	50541	50541	I	0	“ How manly . ”

50665	50696	50661	50661	his	52	“ Do n’t apologize . You have nothing to be sorry for . Do you want me to sit out here awhile , make sure he does n’t come back ? ”
50737	50783	50784	50784	I	0	“ Thank you for offering , but Trace wo n’t come back tonight . He ’ll need to go lick his wounds in some woman ’s bed for a night or two before he works up the nerve to show his face to me again . ”
50792	50838	50784	50784	I	0	“ Believe me , I ’ve seen it a million times . It ’s just too bad I did n’t bring my pocketbook with me today , because I ’ve got a little present for him in it that will definitely keep him away longer . ”
50850	50854	50839	50839	Jackson	54	“ A present ? ”
50855	50859	50839	50839	Jackson	54	“ Pepper spray . ”
50877	50888	50870	50870	He	1190	“ Remind me never to get on your bad side . ”
50902	50934	50935	50935	Jackson	54	“ I do n’t know about a bad side , but I do know that a man has to choose me or lose me . I ’m not a backup plan . ”
50968	50981	50965	50965	He	1190	“ He ’s an idiot . But he ’s a lucky idiot . ”
50982	50989	50965	50965	He	1190	“ Why do you say that ? ”
50990	51000	50965	50965	He	1190	“ Because for a while , he had you . ”
51018	51026	51030	51030	he	1190	“ Can I ask a personal question ? ”
51033	51036	51030	51030	he	1190	“ Yes . ”
51043	51065	51037	51037	I	0	“ Why do you have a semicolon tattooed on your wrist ? I noticed it when we were in the kitchen . ”
51106	51121	51103	51103	He	1190	“ You ’re an avid reader . You know the meaning of a semicolon . ”
51125	51141	51103	51103	He	1190	“ It ’s when the author could have ended a sentence but chose not to . ”
51142	51145	51103	51103	He	1190	“ Exactly . ”
51146	51152	51153	51153	Jackson	54	“ I do n’t understand . ”

51791	51808	51809	51809	She	64	“ It went fine , Mama . Great , in fact . Everyone loved the food . ”
51816	51830	51809	51809	She	64	“ Of course they did . You ’re the best cook in Louisiana . ”

51842	51862	51837	51837	Her	64	“ And how did you get along with the infamous Mr. Boudreaux ? Was he as ornery as usual ? ”
51946	51973	51943	51943	I	0	“ I think sometimes it ’s easier for a man to be the worst version of himself than to let the world keep breaking his heart . ”
51980	51992	51974	51974	Mama	64	“ You been hittin ’ the sauce this morning , baby ? ”
52000	52035	51993	51993	I	0	“ I wish . A nice little soul - numbing habit would go a long way on a day like this . But never mind me , what can I get you to eat ? ”
52048	52060	51993	51993	I	0	“ Lord , please do n’t talk to me about food . ”
52061	52070	52071	52071	I	0	“ You have to eat something , Mama , ”
52074	52094	52071	52071	I	0	“ You need your strength . How about some applesauce or white rice ? A bit of boiled chicken ? ”
52101	52127	52095	52095	Mama	64	“ Nothing . I could n’t keep it down , baby . Just let me sleep for a bit , I ’ll feel better later . ”
52857	52861	52863	52864	my father	2285	“ — married , ”
52874	52882	52866	52866	My	0	“ Sorry ? Who ’s getting married ? ”
52883	52889	52929	52929	his	2285	“ You are , son . ”
52900	52913	52896	52896	I	0	“ I think we both know that ’s never going to happen . ”
52932	52948	52949	52949	My	0	“ You have n’t been listening to a word I ’ve said , have you ? ”
52961	52968	52953	52953	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
52979	53009	52953	52953	I	0	“ I ’m talking about your obligations to this family . I ’m talking about your mother ’s broken heart . I ’m talking about your trust , Jackson . ”
53010	53014	53015	53015	I	0	“ My trust ? ”
53129	53186	53125	53126	My father	2285	“ Yes . Your trust . Which , as you ’d know if you ’d ever bothered to read the thing , stipulates that you must be involved in the day - to - day operation of Boudreaux Bourbon to continue to receive . In lieu of that , you must marry by thirty - five . ”
53202	53281	53198	53199	My father	2285	“ I put that last one in place so you did n’t piss away every dime on strippers and blow , like Harvey Culligan ’s son did . And thirty - five is generous , you have to admit ! I could ’ve made it twenty - five , but I figured a man deserves a few good years to sow his wild oats before he gets hitched . Hoein ’ around builds character . To a point . ”
53310	53366	53307	53307	he	2285	“ Your mother and I have been very , very patient with you , son . This conversation never needed to happen at all if you ’d just married Cricket and taken over as Master Distiller like you were supposed to . But after what you did to that poor girl , well . . . ”
53389	53479	53382	53383	My father	2285	“ We do n’t need to go over all that mess again . My point here , Jackson , is that you ’re my only son . You ’re the heir to this whole thing the Boudreaux family has built over eight generations . If you continue to shirk your obligations and refuse to at least settle down and give your mother the grandbabies she wants , then I ’m sorry to say , but you ’re gon na be cut off without a red cent to your name . ”
53499	53622	53623	53623	He	1233	“ I ’ve been beatin ’ around the bush about this for years because I felt bad about the state you ’ve been in , but now I ’ll put it to you straight . You have until your birthday to get your ass back to Kentucky and take over as Master Distiller , or get married . To a decent girl , mind you . I ’m not welcomin ’ a hoochie mama into this family ! And before you think about bein ’ tricky and gettin ’ a quickie divorce , you should know that any marriage you enter into needs to last at least five years for you to continue to get your money . The decision ’s yours . ”
53701	53711	53713	53713	Rayford	117	“ So your daddy finally threw down the gauntlet , ”
53729	53748	53720	53720	he	117	“ Well , you got ta give Brig some credit . At least he gave you a choice . ”
53749	53753	53754	53754	I	0	“ A choice ? ”
53771	53786	53792	53792	Rayford	117	“ He did n’t give me a choice , he gave me an ultimatum ! ”
53797	53815	53792	53792	Rayford	117	“ No such thing as a free lunch , Mr. Boudreaux . You know that better’n anybody . ”
53824	53841	53816	53816	I	0	“ You know if I ’m poor , you ’re out of a job , right ? ”
53854	53892	53893	53893	He	117	“ Do n’t be foolish . You ’ve got Cody to think about . His care , his education , everything he needs . Besides , you do n’t know the first thing about bein ’ poor . ”
53952	53973	53974	53974	Rayford	117	“ Maybe not , but you know as well as I do that I ’m never going back to Kentucky . ”
53983	53995	53974	53974	Rayford	117	“ So that leaves marriage . Who ’s the lucky girl ? ”
54011	54080	54005	54005	I	0	“ Gimme a break , Rayford ! Even if I wanted to get married — which I don’t — I could n’t find a wife in thirty days ! I have n’t even been on a date in four years ! There ’s not a sane woman in the entire state who ’d agree to marry a complete stranger and stay married to him for half a decade ! ”
54081	54097	54134	54134	he	117	“ So find an insane one . Seems to me there ’s lots of ’em . ”
54098	54109	54110	54110	Rayford	117	“ Jesus Christ . You ’re no help at all . ”
54137	54150	54134	54134	he	117	“ Funny , I thought I was plenty helpful the other night . ”
54159	54174	54151	54151	I	0	“ Please do n’t be cryptic . I ca n’t handle cryptic right now . ”
54188	54216	54181	54181	His	117	“ When I was nowhere to be found at the end of the night of the charity event and you had to drive Miss Bianca Hardwick home . ”
54224	54236	54181	54181	His	117	“ You ’re kidding me . You did that on purpose ? ”
54243	54293	54238	54238	his	117	“ Lovely girl , is n’t she ? Lots of moxie , as my mama used to say . And speakin ’ of mamas , did I overhear her tell you her own mama was havin’ some troubles ? Somethin’ about it bein ’ a rough couple of weeks ? ”
54301	54308	54309	54309	He	117	“ Were you eavesdropping on us ? ”
54312	54337	54338	54338	I	0	“ Just passin ’ by the kitchen . I ’ve got a pair of workin ’ ears , no need to get all excited . ”
54342	54345	54346	54346	He	117	“ Rayford . ”
54349	54360	54346	54346	He	117	“ You know she likes you , do n’t you ? ”
54408	54415	54416	54416	Rayford	117	“ What makes you say that ? ”
54422	54443	54419	54419	his	117	“ If I might be so bold , sir , for a smart man you can sometimes be awful stupid . ”
54508	54523	54505	54505	I	0	“ I told her to smile at me . She was just following orders . ”
54529	54543	54544	54544	He	117	“ No woman smiles at a man like that because of an order . ”
54692	54697	54699	54699	Rayford	117	“ Mm - hmm , ”
54705	54711	54703	54703	himself	117	“ So there you go . ”
54712	54718	54737	54737	he	117	“ There I go what ? ”
54719	54732	54733	54733	he	117	“ Lord , do I have to do all the heavy lifting ? ”
54745	54754	54737	54737	he	117	“ Hello , future Mrs. Jackson Walker Boudreaux ? ”
54758	54769	54770	54770	Rayford	117	“ You ’re . . . that ’s . . . ”
54773	54792	54770	54770	Rayford	117	“ You already know each other , it ’s clear that she likes you and you like her — ”
54793	54801	54737	54737	he	117	“ I never said I liked her . ”
54802	54816	54818	54818	Rayford	117	“ Oh , be quiet , now you ’re just talkin ’ trash , ”
54828	54851	54824	54824	his	117	“ And there ’s a very good chance that if you sweeten the deal a little bit , she ’d say yes . ”
54863	54868	54869	54869	Rayford	117	“ Sweeten the deal ? ”
54896	54919	54892	54892	he	117	“ Everybody ’s got a price . You did n’t know that last time you got engaged , but now you do . ”
54924	54927	54892	54892	he	117	“ Ouch . ”
54928	54969	54970	54970	He	117	“ I know . I ’m sorry . But it seems to me that if you go into it with your eyes open , with all your cards on the table , it might work out for both of you . ”
54979	54988	54970	54970	He	117	“ She does n’t even own a car . ”
55004	55015	55016	55016	Rayford	117	“ I ca n’t believe we ’re having this conversation . ”
55019	55027	55016	55016	Rayford	117	“ You told me Cody likes her . ”
55031	55052	55028	55028	I	0	“ She ’s smart , she ’s got her feet on the ground , and she comes from good stock . ”
55053	55072	55016	55016	Rayford	117	“ Rayford ! What century is this ? We ’re talking about a woman , not a cow ! ”
55073	55086	55028	55028	I	0	“ And she is n’t too hard on the eyes , either . ”
55116	55176	55177	55177	Rayford	117	“ It ’s not gon na happen . What would I do , mosey into her restaurant and say , ‘ Oh , hi there , I was just thinking since you ’re poor and I need a wife that we should get married ’ ? How romantic ! I ’m sure that ’s the proposal of her dreams ! ”
55180	55198	55177	55177	Rayford	117	“ Maybe if you prefaced it with the mention of a million dollars , it would be . ”
55214	55219	55211	55211	I	0	“ A million dollars ? ”
55226	55243	55220	55220	He	117	“ Oh , I ’m sorry , are you not a billionaire ? With a b ? ”
55244	55253	55295	55295	He	117	“ No ! My father is a billionaire ! ”
55254	55270	55271	55271	I	0	“ And who ’s his only son who ’s gon na inherit all that money ? ”
55279	55285	55271	55271	I	0	“ This is completely insane . ”
55298	55316	55295	55295	He	117	“ And who gets an annual trust stipend in the gazillions every year before his father dies ? ”
55317	55325	55295	55295	He	117	“ Gazillions are n’t units of currency . ”
55326	55342	55295	55295	He	117	“ I ’m takin ’ poetic license here , sir , cut me some slack . ”
55369	55504	55366	55366	he	117	“ You do n’t want to go back to Kentucky . You also do n’t want to be dead - ass broke , because you ’ve never had a job in your entire life , and you do n’t know how to do anything except collect overpriced automobiles and mope around in your big ol’ mansion . You would n’t last an hour as a poor man . So your only other option is marriage . Ideally you’da had a girlfriend you could ask , but your antisocial self does n’t have one of those , so we got ta be practical and determine who you could stand livin ’ with for the next few years before you get divorced and go your separate ways , and everybody ’s happy because everybody ’s rich . ”
55510	55529	55505	55505	He	1242	“ And from where I ’m sittin ’ , only one woman in the world fits that bill . ”
55641	55673	55674	55674	she	2293	“ A woman worth her salt should be the hardest thing a man has to work for in his life , because then she ’s a prize , not a gift , ”
55679	55696	55674	55674	she	2293	“ Anything you get for free is worth exactly what you paid for it : nothing . ”
55782	55792	55794	55794	Eeny	56	“ Boo , what ’s happenin ’ with you ? ”
55802	55813	55794	55794	Eeny	56	“ I ’ve never seen you lookin ’ so raggedy ! ”
55900	55907	55908	55908	I	0	“ I ’m fine , Eeny , ”
55944	55952	55954	55954	Eeny	56	“ Girl , you are not fine ! ”
55963	56023	55957	55957	her	56	“ I ’ve known you since I was cookin ’ in your mama ’s restaurant and you were knee - high to a grasshopper , and never once have I seen you in such a state ! I think you should tell me what ’s goin’ on before I pay a visit to Miss Davina and get the truth ! ”
56098	56104	56105	56105	I	0	“ Where ’s your apron ? ”
56108	56117	56118	56118	She	56	“ You ’re blinding me with that getup . ”
56121	56150	56118	56118	She	56	“ I ’m not coverin ’ up this beautiful frock I special ordered with one of those dingy ol’ kitchen aprons ! And do n’t change the subject ! ”
56214	56221	56211	56211	I	0	“ I ’m fighting a bug . ”
56284	56290	56291	56291	she	74	“ He ’s here again ! ”
56295	56300	56291	56291	she	74	“ It ’s him ! ”
56335	56355	56332	56332	I	0	“ He ’ll have to wait for a table , unless you can move some of those reservations around . ”
56393	56407	56408	56408	Eeny	56	“ He does n’t want a table ! He wants to see you ! ”
56411	56425	56408	56408	Eeny	56	“ Get the poor man a pair of sunglasses and a stiff drink . ”
56447	56461	56444	56444	I	0	“ Pepper , please tell him I ’ll be out in a min — ”
56481	56485	56469	56469	He	1264	“ Everyone out . ”
56516	56538	56513	56513	I	0	“ Jackson , we ’re so busy right now . I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t have my employees — ”
56539	56545	56546	56546	he	1264	“ We ’re getting married , ”
56641	56647	56648	56648	I	0	“ How nice for us , ”
56652	56662	56648	56648	I	0	“ And when will the blessed event take place ? ”
56676	56697	56673	56673	He	62	“ As soon as possible . Tonight , if you want . We can go to the courthouse right now . ”
56791	56832	56787	56787	him	62	“ What the Sam hell is the matter with you ? This is my place of business ! Some of us have to work for a living ! You ca n’t just barge in here and start telling stupid jokes — ”
56833	56840	56841	56841	he	62	“ It ’s not a joke , ”
56848	56863	56841	56841	he	62	“ And if you marry me , you ’ll never have to work again . ”
56871	56884	56841	56841	he	62	“ You ’ve lost it . You ’ve seriously lost your mind . ”
56885	56891	56844	56844	his	62	“ Just hear me out — ”
56892	56950	56978	56978	he	62	“ No , I wo n’t hear you out ! I do n’t know who you think you are , but I do n’t find this funny ! And I do n’t have time to listen to whatever stupidity this is ! I swear I oughta just call the loony bin and have them pick you up — ”
56951	56960	56961	56961	He	62	“ I ’ll give you a million dollars . ”
57076	57081	57073	57073	I	0	“ How dare you . ”
57082	57090	57073	57073	I	0	“ I know you need the money — ”
57174	57184	57171	57171	he	62	“ What the hell did you do that for ? ”
57192	57225	57189	57189	I	0	“ I ’m not a whore , Jackson Boudreaux . Whatever your opinion is of me , I ’m setting you straight right here and now . You ca n’t buy me . ”
57226	57244	57189	57189	I	0	“ I do n’t think you ’re a whore ! Jesus Christ , hold on a minute — ”
57245	57290	57171	57171	he	62	“ No , you hold on , you rich , dumb , arrogant ass ! I took the catering job because I needed the money , yes , but not for myself , and not so I could get sold into prostitution later on ! ”
57291	57297	57189	57189	I	0	“ What the fucking hell — ”
57298	57329	57189	57189	I	0	“ You should be ashamed of yourself ! What would your mother say if she could see you right now , offering money to a girl to sleep with you ? ”
57330	57336	57171	57171	he	62	“ Holy fuck , Bianca ! ”
57337	57343	57344	57344	He	1278	“ Stop cursing at me ! ”
57355	57371	57344	57344	He	1278	“ I never said anything about sleeping with me ! I ’m talking about marriage ! ”
57393	57399	57400	57400	I	0	“ Oh , I see , ”
57406	57416	57400	57400	I	0	“ You ’re gay . You need a beard . ”
57429	57437	57438	57438	He	1278	“ No . I am not gay . ”
57443	57462	57438	57438	He	1278	“ And you know it , because that kiss we had was hotter than the sidewalk in July . ”
57474	57480	57471	57471	I	0	“ Your metaphors need work . ”
57481	57494	57471	57471	I	0	“ Excuse me . Hotter than a billy goat with a blowtorch . ”
57495	57521	57522	57522	His	1278	“ That does n’t even make sense . And comparing a lady ’s kiss to anything to do with a goat is just bad manners . ”
57534	57563	57529	57529	his	1278	“ You ’re right . I ’ll try it again . That kiss was hotter than a housewife reading Fifty Shades of Grey at the Magic Mike premiere . ”
57568	57571	57572	57572	I	0	“ Better , ”
57617	57628	57598	57598	He	1278	“ Obviously I came at this in the wrong way — ”
57629	57633	57634	57634	He	1278	“ You think ? ”
57637	57667	57634	57634	He	1278	“ Can I just get a word in edgewise , please ? Let me say my piece , and then you can send me on my way . Deal ? ”
57712	57716	57717	57717	he	1278	“ Thank you , ”
57720	57739	57717	57717	he	1278	“ Okay . A little backstory . I have a trust . It ’s . . . big . ”
57749	57808	57745	57745	Jackson	54	“ As I was saying , I have a big trust . And no , that ’s not a metaphor . I found out today that to keep my trust and inherit my fortune once my father dies , I need to either work for the family company or get married . By my thirty - fifth birthday . ”
57814	57820	57809	57809	His	1278	“ Which is next month . ”
57826	57836	57821	57821	I	0	“ So go work for the company , dummy ! ”
57864	57879	57849	57849	he	1278	“ I ca n’t . I ’ll never go back to Kentucky . Never . ”
57880	57884	57885	57885	He	1278	“ Why not ? ”
57897	57907	57892	57892	his	1278	“ There ’s nothing for me there but ghosts . ”
57973	57978	57979	57979	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
57982	58023	57979	57979	I	0	“ So marry some debutante and have your two point five perfect babies and live happily ever after with your country club membership and your polo ponies . I ’m sorry , but I do n’t see the problem here . ”
58045	58063	58042	58042	He	1278	“ The problem is that you ’re the only woman I ’ve liked in a long time . ”
58073	58101	58064	58064	He	1278	“ And I do n’t want to be poor . I ’d be exceedingly bad at it . For one thing , I ’m not nice enough . ”
58102	58113	58114	58114	He	1278	“ How ridiculous . Not all poor people are nice . ”
58117	58141	58114	58114	He	1278	“ Really ? Every poor person I ’ve ever met has been extremely nice to me . Well . . . except you . ”
58148	58170	58142	58142	I	0	“ God , you ’re hopeless . They ’re nice to you because you ’re rich ! They want your money ! ”
58171	58174	58175	58175	He	1278	“ Oh . ”
58179	58189	58175	58175	He	1278	“ I thought only rich people were like that . ”
58197	58218	58190	58190	I	0	“ You ’re right . You could n’t be poor . You have no idea what real life is like . ”
58219	58222	58223	58223	he	1278	“ Exactly ! ”
58226	58233	58223	58223	he	1278	“ So you understand my predicament ! ”
58234	58288	58190	58190	I	0	“ What I understand is that I have a restaurant full of guests and I ’m standing in a dark alley talking to a delusional rich man about his imaginary problems . You need a bride , run an ad in the paper . You ’d have five thousand responses the first day . ”
58289	58323	58223	58223	he	1278	“ I told you . You ’re the only woman I ’ve liked in a long time . I do n’t like strangers . I do n’t trust people . Women in particular . ”
58339	58357	58326	58326	I	0	“ You just told me I was n’t nice to you . Why would you like me ? ”
58364	58381	58326	58326	I	0	“ You ’re honest . And real . And you do n’t care about my money — ”
58382	58395	58223	58223	he	1278	“ Ha ! So you offer me a million dollars of it ? ”
58396	58461	58462	58462	He	1283	“ I was n’t finished . You do n’t care about my money , and you ’re kind , and responsible , and you ’re not afraid to call me on my shit , and you ’re so fucking beautiful it sometimes hurts to look at you , like I ’m gazing into the sun and could go blind if I stare too long . ”
58518	58521	58515	58515	I	0	“ Oh . ”
58594	58608	58591	58591	I	0	“ Let me get this straight . You want me to marry you . ”
58609	58612	58591	58591	I	0	“ Yes . ”
58613	58625	58591	58591	I	0	“ But I do n’t have to have sex with you . ”
58626	58629	58591	58591	I	0	“ Right . ”
58630	58645	58591	58591	I	0	“ If I do n’t marry you , you wo n’t marry anyone else . ”
58646	58649	58591	58591	I	0	“ Correct . ”
58650	58667	58668	58668	He	1283	“ And there ’s no chance of you going to work for your family ’s company . ”
58674	58677	58670	58670	his	1283	“ None . ”
58678	58719	58720	58720	He	1283	“ So what you ’re basically telling me is that if I do n’t agree to marry you , I ’ll be responsible for you losing all your money and becoming a pauper and ruining the rest of your life . ”
58723	58730	58731	58731	I	0	“ Well . . . yes . ”
58734	58740	58731	58731	I	0	“ Gee , no pressure . ”
58754	58773	58741	58741	He	1283	“ It would n’t have to be forever . Just five years and then we could get divorced . ”
58774	58778	58779	58779	I	0	“ Five years ! ”
58785	58811	58779	58779	I	0	“ I ’m thirty - one years old , Jackson ; that puts me close to forty by the time you ’re finished with me ! ”
58821	58834	58812	58812	He	1283	“ I think your math is a little off there , Bianca . ”
58835	58861	58862	58862	He	1283	“ What if I want kids ? Have you considered that ? By the time we get divorced , I ’d be an old maid ! ”
58865	58903	58862	58862	He	1283	“ Hardly . And you could always do IVF . I mean , you ’d have enough money . Or get a surrogate . Or adopt . . . why are you looking at me like that ? ”
58904	59003	59008	59008	he	1283	“ Because I ’m having an out - of - body experience . Somehow I ’ve been transported to an alternate universe where a psychotic billionaire is trying to convince me to enter into a sham marriage , give up five years of my life , and forego the possibility of actually falling in love and sharing a future with someone . Someone who loves me for who I am , not what I can do for him . Do you really think any amount of money could convince me to do something so — so — wrong ? ”
59034	59039	59027	59027	he	1283	“ You ’re right . ”
59048	59093	59040	59040	He	1283	“ You ’re absolutely right . I ’m so sorry . This was . . . stupid . Reckless . I should n’t have thought you ’d . . . you ’re not the kind of . . . fuck . Please forgive me . ”
59490	59494	59495	59495	I	0	“ You okay ? ”
59585	59589	59570	59570	Chemo	162	“ Mrs. Hardwick . ”
59643	59646	59647	59647	I	0	“ So ? ”
59687	59691	59684	59684	He	68	“ Good news . ”
59710	59755	59756	59756	Mama	64	“ The scan shows the tumor has shrunk about fifty percent , which is where we needed it to be before we could do surgery . Your body has reacted very well to the chemotherapy drugs , Mrs. Hardwick . How are you feeling ? ”
59760	59770	59756	59756	Mama	64	“ Like I went twelve rounds with Muhammad Ali . ”
59775	59791	59771	59772	The doctor	956	“ Once chemo is stopped , you ’ll start to feel a whole lot better . ”
59814	59826	59811	59811	I	0	“ So does this mean she ’s going to be okay ? ”
59848	59971	59972	59972	He	68	“ It means the treatment is working . Which is excellent , mind you . Many times we have to try several different drugs before we see a result . But I do n’t want to sugarcoat anything . After we remove the tumor , we ’re looking at an additional five to fifteen weeks of chemo to get any stray cancer cells that might have been left behind in the lung or chest wall . We also need to consider radiation , depending on the outcome of the surgery . The lymph nodes are only marginally involved , which is good , but we wo n’t really know if the cancer has been contained , or eradicated , for several months . ”
60119	60133	60135	60136	Doc Halloran	68	“ I ’d like to schedule the surgery for the week after next , ”
60206	60210	60197	60198	my mother	263	“ Do it . ”
60241	60244	60246	60246	Rayford	117	“ Sir , ”

60259	60266	60267	60267	I	0	“ I ’ll buy another one , ”
60504	60512	60513	60513	Rayford	117	“ Maybe you should have a drink , ”
60520	60532	60513	60513	Rayford	117	“ So you do n’t scare the poor girl off with all this”—he
60539	60541	60513	60513	Rayford	117	air—“energy . ”
60542	60548	60549	60549	I	0	“ My energy ’s fine , ”
60559	60585	60556	60556	Rayford	117	“ Sure , if you ’re gearin ’ up to ride into battle on your war horse and lop off some heads with an axe . ”
60601	60637	60598	60598	He	117	“ Have it your way . But do n’t say I did n’t warn you when I open the door and Miss Bianca sees the state you ’re in and turns around and runs off . ”
60638	60648	60649	60649	I	0	“ She ’s not the running - off type , ”
60652	60684	60685	60685	Rayford	117	“ She ’s more the light - you - on - fire - and - walk - calmly - away - while - you - burn - to - ashes type . ”
60688	60696	60685	60685	Rayford	117	“ This is gon na be fun . ”
60705	60733	60734	60734	He	117	“ Fun ? This is the most bizarre and unbelievably serious thing I ’ve done in my life , and you ’re talking about it being fun ? ”
60737	60745	60734	60734	He	117	“ I meant for me , sir . ”
60759	60768	60755	60755	Rayford	117	“ And here ’s the fire starter now ! ”
60986	61006	61008	61008	Bianca	60	“ Are you going to invite me in , or would you prefer we talked in the front yard ? ”
61040	61043	61044	61044	I	0	“ Yes , ”
61051	61055	61044	61044	I	0	“ Come in . ”
61170	61180	61181	61181	she	60	“ A three - legged stool and a whip , ”
61199	61209	61210	61210	Rayford	117	“ Is n’t that what every lion tamer needs ? ”
61221	61227	61228	61228	I	0	“ Thank you , Rayford , ”
61246	61252	61228	61228	I	0	“ That will be all . ”
61253	61258	61259	61259	he	117	“ Yes , sir , ”
61300	61313	61295	61295	Bianca	60	“ So , Mr. Boudreaux , are you ready for a Mrs. ? ”
61334	61374	61375	61375	She	60	“ That makes two of us . And if you do n’t mind , I ’ll have whatever it is you ’re having . My stomach is pitching the kind of dying duck fit only hard liquor can help . ”
61487	61492	61493	61493	she	60	“ Please sit down , ”
61496	61504	61493	61493	she	60	“ You ’re intimidating when you hover . ”
61505	61516	61517	61517	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you ’d find anything intimidating , ”
61539	61555	61556	61556	she	60	“ I suppose you ’ll soon be finding out all kinds of things about me , ”
61580	61585	61569	61569	I	0	“ I ’m worried . ”
61594	61597	61588	61588	she	60	“ Worried ? ”
61601	61605	61598	61598	I	0	“ About what ? ”
61615	61649	61606	61606	My	0	“ About this . About what we ’re about to do , if we agree to do it . But mostly . . . about fucking things up and making you hate me . ”
61668	61685	61659	61659	She	60	“ Thank you . I do n’t know why , but that makes me feel better . ”
61795	61799	61792	61792	she	60	“ You shaved . ”
61808	61815	61816	61816	She	60	“ I know you prefer it . ”
61846	61858	61843	61843	She	60	“ And you ’re wearing a suit . With a tie . ”
61864	61882	61843	61843	She	60	“ I never said I did n’t own any suits . I just said I hate them . ”
61883	61890	61843	61843	She	60	“ But you ’re wearing one . ”
61891	61900	61901	61901	We	1331	“ The occasion seemed to call for it . ”
61922	61929	61930	61930	she	60	“ Oh God this is weird ! ”
61938	61942	61943	61943	She	60	“ I know . ”
61995	62005	61988	61988	Jackson	54	“ My mother has lung cancer . Stage three . ”
62033	62114	62030	62030	she	60	“ We ’re broke . She does n’t have insurance . Her doctor wants to do surgery . Chemo has shrunk her tumor , but she needs surgery and possibly radiation , and definitely more chemo after the surgery . All that stuff costs money . A lot of money . I ’ve already burned through the twenty grand you gave me for the charity event , and that was only for the initial rounds of chemo and some prescriptions . ”
62135	62233	62115	62115	She	60	“ There ’s no guarantee the surgery will work , of course , but without the surgery she ’s dead . That ’s it . Finito . Over . Done . Sixty - four years of running a business and raising a child and being a wonderful wife and mother and friend and good citizen and God - fearing churchgoer and taking care of everyone else without a thought to her own needs , and this is what she gets in repayment . Cancer . Like that ’s fair ? Like that ’s how it should be ? ”
62288	62316	62285	62285	Bianca	60	“ My mother is my closest friend . She ’s the best person I ’ve ever known . I ’d do anything for her , you understand ? ”
62325	62328	62329	62329	I	0	“ Yes , ”
62333	62365	62329	62329	I	0	“ I understand . You ’ll marry a man you do n’t love and give up five years of your own life so you can have the money to save hers . ”
62379	62400	62376	62376	I	0	“ That does n’t make you a whore , forgive me for saying that word . It makes you selfless . ”
62416	62444	62401	62401	She	60	“ I do n’t know what it makes me , but I ’ve decided it does n’t matter . I ’m willing to do whatever it takes . ”
62516	62527	62512	62512	I	0	“ Tell me what will make this easier for you . ”
62579	62587	62576	62576	she	60	“ Knowing what to expect will help . ”
62614	62623	62611	62611	I	0	“ Sex is n’t part of the contract . ”
62645	62653	62642	62642	She	60	“ So we ’ll have a contract ? ”
62657	62712	62642	62642	She	60	“ My attorney will draw it up based on whatever agreement we make , and you can have your attorney review it . The only nonnegotiables are the five - year time period prior to a divorce , a nondisclosure , and that you have to live here for the entirety of the marriage . ”
62717	62723	62724	62724	I	0	“ Married people live together , ”
62776	62799	62773	62773	I	0	“ There are eight guest bedrooms here , besides the master bedroom and Cody ’s room . You can have your pick . ”
62901	62910	62898	62898	She	60	“ I do n’t want a million dollars , ”
62959	62964	62965	62965	she	60	“ What I want , ”
62968	63006	62965	62965	she	60	“ is for you to pay for all my mother ’s medical bills , prescriptions , any hospitalizations and surgeries , and whatever other necessary care she needs , until she beats the cancer or . . . ”
63023	63027	63020	63020	I	0	“ Keep talking . ”
63033	63038	63030	63030	her	60	“ That ’s it . ”
63057	63067	63053	63053	I	0	“ What do you mean , that ’s it ? ”
63073	63125	63068	63068	She	60	“ Anything else and I ’ll feel dirty . This is n’t about greed or getting rich . I love my life , if you want to know the truth . And if I ’m being perfectly honest , all your money does n’t seem to have made you very happy . ”
63131	63243	63126	63126	She	60	“ The only problem I have is that I ca n’t pay for my mother ’s cancer treatments . We could run up a huge bill and let the hospital come after us , but then we ’re looking at bankruptcy court and debt collectors and maybe even having what few assets she owns being seized . And my mama is too proud to even tell her friends she ’s sick — she’d rather die than go bankrupt or be a burden on anyone . If she lost her house and had to move in with me , she ’d stick her head in the oven the first chance she got . ”
63263	63282	63260	63260	I	0	“ There must be something you want for yourself . Something for the restaurant , or your future — ”
63283	63290	63291	63291	she	60	“ My future is my concern , ”
63300	63339	63291	63291	she	60	“ You ’re buying a five - year pretend wife , and I ’m buying a chance for my mother to live . That ’s it . That ’s the deal , or we do n’t have one . ”
63384	63389	63390	63390	I	0	“ How about this , ”
63393	63493	63390	63390	I	0	“ I ’ll put the money in a trust and name you the sole trustee . That way it will be protected , and you can have access to the money whenever you need it , instead of having to rely on me . I think it would be . . . awkward for you to have to come to me with every bill . Then whatever is left over when your mother gets better , you can do with as you choose . Buy your mother a bigger house , give it to charity , whatever you want . ”
63506	63519	63502	63502	I	0	“ That ’s the deal , or we do n’t have one . ”
63553	63565	63549	63549	She	2318	“ All right , Mr. Boudreaux . You have a deal . ”
63596	63611	63593	63593	I	0	“ How many times do I have to tell you to call me Jackson . ”
63624	63651	63621	63621	she	2318	“ I suppose if I ’m going to be your wife , I ought to have a nickname for you . Does anyone call you Jax ? ”
63695	63698	63699	63699	I	0	“ No , ”
63706	63718	63699	63699	I	0	“ No one calls me Jax . No one but you . ”
64119	64137	64138	64138	I	0	“ He ’s so charming I could n’t help but fall in love with him , Mama ! ”
64206	64210	64211	64211	I	0	“ Unplanned pregnancy ? ”
64233	64261	64221	64221	I	0	“ Not unless you want to pretend you ’ve been sleeping with a man everyone thinks you hate and then fake a miscarriage in a few months . ”
64276	64323	64324	64325	The cabbie	334	“ Temporary insanity ? Hmm . Probably the most reasonable explanation , other than suffering a recent head injury . Lord , this is bad . How am I gon na get anyone to believe I married him for love when all we do is fight ? ”
64341	64348	64324	64325	The cabbie	334	“ Slap , slap , kiss . ”
64356	64360	64351	64351	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
64373	64434	64361	64361	He	334	“ It ’s a popular film and TV trope where the writers put two characters who ca n’t stand each other in close quarters and let them verbally spar , until one of them suddenly kisses the other , and they both realize they ’ve had mad sexual chemistry all along and the fighting was just a cover for it . ”
64447	64488	64489	64489	I	0	“ Just brainstorming with you . I ’m a writer . Or trying to be . I spend lots of time studying this trope stuff . It ’s actually how stories are told . Even Shakespeare is filled with tropes . ”
64493	64499	64489	64489	I	0	“ You do n’t say . ”
64500	64504	64505	64505	he	334	“ Oh yeah , ”
64514	64604	64605	64605	I	0	“ For instance , Much Ado About Nothing ? That play is stuffed so full of tropes you could choke on them ! But the bottom line is that two of the main characters , Beatrice and Benedick , have this history of seriously hating on each other , but everyone else can see they ’re perfectly matched . I mean , the opposite of love is n’t hate . It ’s indifference . They would n’t fight so much if they did n’t care so much , right ? ”
64608	64622	64605	64605	I	0	“ It sounds like a really dysfunctional relationship , if you ask me . ”
64630	64661	64623	64624	The cabbie	334	“ Yeah , but all the best ones are . It ’s not true love if you do n’t want to kick his teeth in every once in a while . ”
64742	64752	64753	64753	I	0	“ Why that low - down , dirty dog ! ”
64804	64811	64813	64813	Mama	64	“ Well here she is now ! ”
64841	64858	64859	64859	I	0	“ Your ears must ’ve been burning , chère , we were just talking about you ! ”
64864	64881	64859	64859	I	0	“ I do n’t know about my ears , but my ass is certainly on fire ! ”
64882	64885	64886	64886	Mama	64	“ Bianca ! ”
64899	64916	64891	64891	She	64	“ I did not raise you to speak like that ! You apologize right this minute ! ”
64917	64937	64939	64939	Trace	71	“ It ’s all right , Mrs. Hardwick . It ’s probably just the new influence in her life , ”
64951	64970	64946	64946	He	71	“ I hear that Jackson Boudreaux fella Bianca ’s been spending time with has really earned his nickname . ”
64971	64978	64979	64979	I	0	“ One more word , Trace , ”
64982	65010	64979	64979	I	0	“ and I ’m gon na get my daddy ’s gun out of the garage and turn you from a rooster to a hen with one shot . ”
65011	65030	65031	65031	Mama	64	“ Now stop it , Bianca , I wo n’t have this kind of behavior in my home ! ”
65075	65086	65087	65087	I	0	“ What are you doing out of bed , Mama ? ”
65107	65162	65097	65097	She	64	“ I ’m sick of being in bed , Bianca , and I ’m feeling a little better today , so I got up and had breakfast . Then Trace called and asked if he could come by , and I was in the mood for a little visiting , so I said yes . ”
65163	65180	65182	65182	Trace	71	“ It ’s real nice you ’re taking such good care of your mama , Bianca , ”
65187	65190	65184	65184	I	0	“ What ? ”
65191	65199	65200	65200	he	71	“ Since she ’s been so sick , ”
65203	65211	65200	65200	he	71	“ You know , with the flu ? ”
65280	65292	65277	65277	I	0	“ Right . The flu . It ’s been going around . ”
65307	65316	65305	65305	Trace	71	“ So you were just leaving , right ? ”
65390	65405	65387	65387	He	71	“ Actually I was just telling your mama about the new business I started . ”
65488	65490	65543	65543	He	71	“ investor ”
65526	65536	65522	65522	I	0	“ Another new business . How thrilling for you . ”
65546	65569	65543	65543	He	71	“ It is , actually . It ’s the one we always talked about starting together . You remember , bumble bee ? ”
65576	65579	65580	65580	I	0	“ No , ”
65598	65650	65589	65589	He	71	“ Sure you do ! A restaurant . Got a few investors with some serious cheese , just signed the lease on the space . We ’ll be opening up next month . Right down the street from your place , as a matter of fact . We ’ll be neighbors ! ”
65663	65671	65660	65660	Mama	64	“ Why that ’s wonderful , Trace ! ”
65769	65788	65758	65758	I	0	“ Is n’t that nice . Would you mind if I talked to you outside for a minute ? ”
65898	65902	65903	65903	he	71	“ Of course , ”
65919	65930	65912	65912	He	71	“ Always a pleasure to see you , Mrs. Hardwick . ”
65931	65937	65938	65938	she	64	“ And you , Trace , ”
66018	66037	66000	66000	he	71	“ I was just about to ask your mama for some of her recipes when you came in . ”
66082	66111	66079	66079	I	0	“ If you ever come near her again , I ’ll break into your house when you ’re not home and replace all your shampoo with hair remover . ”
66129	66218	66121	66121	I	0	“ You ’re a liar . And a cheater . And I do n’t care how much you screech about finding God , a leopard does n’t change his spots . I know all your tricks , Trace Adams . I know all your tells . And I know that you getting into the restaurant business has nothing to do with new investors and everything to do with trying to outdo me and prove that I made a mistake when I kicked your sorry behind to the curb . ”
66222	66228	66219	66219	Trace	71	“ Well , you did . ”
66236	66241	66242	66242	He	71	“ You ’re unbelievable . ”
66266	66286	66263	66263	He	71	“ I know I made my mistakes , too , but I want to put all that behind us . ”
66292	66329	66287	66287	His	71	“ C’m on , bumble bee . I know you still have feelings for me , or you never would ’ve kissed that asshole in the car the other night . That ’s not your style . ”
66350	66357	66347	66347	I	0	“ That asshole is my fiancé ! ”
66375	66381	66382	66382	He	71	“ The fuck you say ? ”
66395	66409	66382	66382	He	71	“ You heard me . We ’re engaged . We ’re getting married . ”
66431	66454	66428	66428	he	71	“ Huh . Never thought I ’d see the day that Miss High and Mighty turned into a gold - digging whore . ”
66501	66522	66523	66523	I	0	“ There he is . There ’s the Trace I know . Welcome back , player . Now get lost ! ”
66555	66578	66545	66545	He	71	“ How much he payin ’ you , Bianca ? How much does it cost to get you to suck a dick ? ”
66596	66639	66640	66640	I	0	“ If you come near me or my mama again , I ’ll call the police . And then I ’ll call my future husband . And believe me , Trace , you ’ll want the police to get to you first . ”
66836	66841	66833	66833	I	0	“ Oh . Hello . ”
66873	66880	66846	66846	He	53	“ Is this a bad time ? ”
66898	66909	66895	66895	I	0	“ It ’s fine . They ’re contained for now . ”
66930	66938	66939	66939	I	0	“ Let ’s go into my office . ”
67029	67037	67021	67021	He	53	“ Looks like a bomb went off . ”
67067	67072	67073	67073	I	0	“ From an admirer ? ”
67076	67087	67073	67073	I	0	“ If you can call Satan ’s spawn an admirer . ”
67128	67156	67157	67157	Jackson	53	“ I ’m sorry , bumble bee . I did n’t mean what I said yesterday . Please call me , we need to talk . Trace . ”
67184	67188	67181	67181	He	53	“ What happened ? ”
67200	67214	67189	67189	I	0	“ We had a little run - in at my mother ’s house . ”
67215	67221	67222	67222	he	53	“ A run - in ? ”
67238	67277	67226	67226	His	53	“ Long story short , I stopped by Mama ’s on my way to the restaurant , and he was there . I told him we were getting married , and he called me the c - word . ”
67299	67307	67296	67296	I	0	“ That ’s not the worst part . ”
67334	67341	67342	67342	I	0	“ He ’s opening a restaurant , ”
67356	67380	67342	67342	I	0	“ Down the street . As a big f - you to me and all the plans we made to do it together . ”
67422	67482	67483	67483	Jackson	53	“ It ’s just another one of his childish games . There ’s nothing he ca n’t stand as much as being ignored , and he knew this would get my attention . He wants me to obsess over it . Which is why the only thing I can do is act like it does n’t get to me . ”
67487	67492	67483	67483	Jackson	53	“ We ’ll see . ”
67507	67516	67483	67483	Jackson	53	“ I ’m not condoning violence , Jackson . ”
67517	67541	67542	67542	His	53	“ Who said anything about violence ? There are ways to deal with this kind of situation that do n’t involve shedding blood . ”
67548	67575	67576	67576	I	0	“ Even though I ’d very much like to rip his head off and shove it up his own ass for what he said to you . ”
67608	67625	67596	67596	I	0	“ Sit . Please . You ’re making the room seem smaller than it already is . ”
67691	67697	67698	67698	he	53	“ I brought the contract , ”
67711	67720	67704	67704	I	0	“ Bianca . Your face just went white . ”
67730	67738	67739	67739	We	1403	“ That would certainly be a feat . ”
67748	67756	67745	67745	He	53	“ Do you want to see it ? ”
67791	67804	67805	67805	he	53	“ You need to have your attorney review it before you sign , ”
67809	67817	67805	67805	he	53	“ I do n’t have an attorney . ”
67818	67823	67841	67841	his	53	“ Then get one . ”
67824	67834	67835	67835	He	53	“ I ca n’t afford an attorney , Jax . ”
67867	67874	67860	67860	I	0	“ Do I make you uncomfortable ? ”
67875	67882	67845	67845	his	53	“ Do n’t change the subject . ”
67883	67907	67908	67908	He	53	“ It ’s a legitimate question . If we ’re going to be married , I should probably know these kinds of things . ”
67917	67929	67908	67908	He	53	“ You ’ve made me uncomfortable since the moment we met . ”
67977	67986	67974	67974	I	0	“ I ’ve been thinking about the rings . ”
68007	68027	68004	68004	he	53	“ I ca n’t concentrate with these fucking roses staring down at me like a dozen bloody middle fingers . ”
68039	68083	68084	68084	Jackson	53	“ I was going to toss them in the garbage as soon as they arrived this morning , but Eeny said she ’d take them . Something about a ritual involving rose petals and goat blood . I did n’t ask for details . ”
68127	68130	68131	68131	he	53	“ Better , ”
68134	68140	68131	68131	he	53	“ The rings . Shoot . ”
68148	68180	68143	68143	I	0	“ I want a five - carat flawless Tiffany brilliant - cut center stone with a pair of flawless one - carat stones flanking it , set in a platinum band . ”
68191	68209	68188	68188	I	0	“ You got me . A simple gold band will do . What should I get you ? ”
68222	68231	68210	68210	He	53	“ You want to get me a ring ? ”
68232	68261	68212	68212	his	53	“ I ’m not marrying a man who refuses to wear my ring . If we ’re doing this , we ’re doing it right . Jewelry included . ”
68262	68268	68210	68210	He	53	“ Why does it matter ? ”
68294	68298	68282	68303	every other female who looked at him to see that small gold “ off - limits ” sign on his ring finger	1407	“ off - limits ”
68382	68402	68379	68379	He	53	“ Whatever conversation you ’re having with yourself , I ’d love to join in . It looks fascinating . ”
68420	68436	68412	68412	his	53	“ I was just . . . wondering . . . about the sex stuff . ”
68482	68487	68488	68488	he	53	“ What about it ? ”
68519	68533	68510	68510	I	0	“ Um . What if you get a girlfriend ? How do we — ”
68534	68539	68498	68498	his	53	“ I wo n’t . ”
68552	68595	68548	68548	I	0	“ You ca n’t know that . You could meet someone the day after we get married and fall madly in love with her . We should talk about what will happen in that scenario . Would she come live with us ? ”
68640	68648	68649	68649	he	53	“ There wo n’t be any girlfriends , ”
68652	68666	68649	68649	he	53	“ There wo n’t be anyone else while I ’m married to you . ”
68688	68705	68706	68706	He	53	“ So the ‘ no sex ’ clause is actually like a ‘ celibacy ’ clause ? ”
68723	68733	68706	68706	He	53	“ You should go over it with your attorney . ”
68734	68744	68747	68747	his	53	“ I want to go over it with you . ”
68758	68781	68747	68747	his	53	“ It clarifies that there ’s no expectation of sex between us . It ’s not a requirement to fulfill the contract . ”
68790	68799	68800	68800	He	53	“ So , then , it ’s voluntary . ”
68856	68867	68853	68853	I	0	“ I mean , it ’s not against the rules . ”
68889	68901	68885	68885	He	53	“ Why , Future Mrs. Boudreaux , are you propositioning me ? ”
68937	68940	68941	68941	I	0	“ Sorry , ”
68944	68963	68941	68941	I	0	“ This is just all very strange . I suppose I ’m nervous . Forget I even asked . ”
68964	68981	68982	68982	I	0	“ Oh , no . You ’re not getting off that easily . Look at me . ”
68995	69005	68992	68992	He	53	“ When was the last time you had sex ? ”
69013	69021	69022	69022	I	0	“ That ’s none of your business , ”
69037	69051	69034	69034	He	53	“ The last time I had sex was more than four years ago . ”
69057	69067	69052	69052	His	53	“ I mean , with anyone other than myself . ”
69079	69084	69071	69071	I	0	“ No ! Really ? ”
69085	69088	69052	69052	His	53	“ Really . ”
69089	69095	69096	69096	He	53	“ Are you a monk ? ”
69111	69122	69096	69096	He	53	“ Do you get the impression I ’m a monk ? ”
69156	69179	69145	69145	I	0	“ Did you . . . go through . . . um , a time when you were n’t sure . . . ”
69188	69200	69201	69201	I	0	“ I already told you I ’m not gay , Bianca . ”
69204	69209	69210	69210	He	53	“ So . . . ”
69213	69269	69210	69210	He	53	“ I ’m not bisexual , either , if that ’s where you ’re heading ! I ’m not confused about which sex I prefer , and I do n’t have a disease I ’m trying not to spread ! I just have n’t had a girlfriend for a while , for Christ ’s sake ! ”
69289	69315	69210	69210	He	53	“ Okay , I hear you , you ’re not confused , you ’re not diseased , you ’re just unusually . . . nonsexual . ”
69408	69418	69405	69405	He	53	“ Tell me if this feels nonsexual to you . ”
69684	69687	69688	69688	I	0	“ Oh , ”
69698	69706	69691	69691	His	53	“ Yes , oh . Stop talking . ”
69917	69924	69925	69925	I	0	“ We ’re not done yet , ”
70027	70039	70020	70020	Someone	2329	“ Boss ? Sorry to interrupt . Meat delivery finally arrived . ”
70057	70061	70062	70062	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
70075	70082	70062	70062	I	0	“ I ’ll be right out . ”
70127	70134	70124	70124	I	0	“ I have to . . . ”
70135	70144	70145	70145	His	53	“ I know . Give me a second . ”
70195	70202	70180	70180	He	53	“ What are these scars from ? ”
70235	70242	70232	70232	he	53	“ A man - eating shark . ”
70354	70362	70351	70351	I	0	“ Well . That was . . . ”
70394	70421	70391	70391	he	53	“ Get the contract reviewed by an attorney as soon as possible . Send the invoice to me . And I need to meet your mother . ”
70533	70537	70538	70538	he	53	“ Miss Hardwick , ”
70560	70568	70538	70538	he	53	“ This is . . . unusual . ”
70579	70585	70538	70538	he	53	“ You do n’t say ! ”
70586	70597	70598	70598	he	53	“ I ’ve never seen anything quite like this before , ”
70616	70631	70632	70632	he	53	“ I assume that you ’re entering into this agreement due to . . . ”
70639	70643	70632	70632	he	53	“ Financial problems ? ”
70644	70654	70655	70655	He	53	“ Bingo . So give me the bad news . ”
70659	70678	70655	70655	He	53	“ You ’re marrying a man solely for his money . What other bad news do you need ? ”
70714	70730	70731	70731	He	53	“ I ’m talking about the contract . What ’s bad in there for me ? ”
70751	70801	70748	70748	I	0	“ I know . You can stop judging me now , okay ? Just tell me if there ’s anything in the contract we should counter . For instance , the part where it talks about me not having to have sex with him . Is that in order ? ”
70827	70830	70831	70831	he	53	“ Yes , ”
70839	70866	70831	70831	he	53	“ But we should counter for more money . One million dollars for five years is only two hundred thousand dollars per year . That works out to”—he
70876	70921	70831	70831	he	53	up—“five hundred fifty - five dollars per day . Give or take . In my professional opinion , that ’s not nearly enough compensation for the length of time involved . You should be asking for five million at least , ideally double that . ”
70931	70945	70922	70922	I	0	“ The amount stays the same . That ’s not the important part . ”
70979	71002	71003	71003	I	0	“ I do n’t concur , Miss Hardwick . When you ’re marrying for money , money is the only important part . ”
71006	71011	71003	71003	I	0	“ It ’s complicated . ”
71012	71018	71024	71024	he	53	“ Uncomplicate it for me . ”
71030	71075	71027	71027	his	53	“ I ’m sorry , Miss Hardwick , but my advice to you is not to sign this document . It is n’t in your best interest . You could conceivably make one million dollars in five years with the income from your restaurant . ”
71105	71138	71093	71093	I	0	“ Aside from the money , is there anything else in there I should worry about ? Any language you want to tweak ? Any offensive codicils we should remove ? Anything ? ”
71156	71183	71153	71153	he	53	“ A few minor points . It ’s very straightforward , actually , and fair , if such a word could be applied to this situation . ”
71184	71187	71188	71188	I	0	“ Good , ”
71200	71211	71212	71212	He	53	“ Can you have the changes to me by tomorrow ? ”
71222	71228	71219	71219	his	53	“ May I say something ? ”
71229	71232	71238	71238	he	53	“ No . ”
71248	71292	71245	71245	he	53	“ You ’re an attractive young woman , Miss Hardwick . You also seem intelligent and pragmatic , a combination that in my experience is rarer than a unicorn sighting . There ’s no need for someone like you to sell yourself short . ”
71313	71323	71309	71309	I	0	“ Just have the changes to me by tomorrow , ”
71449	71452	71425	71425	it	1429	“ Hello ? ”
71453	71460	71461	71461	He	53	“ Bianca . It ’s Jackson . ”
71469	71480	71461	71461	He	53	“ As if I could n’t tell from the growl . ”
71481	71502	71503	71503	I	0	“ Why were n’t you answering ? I called the front desk and Pepper insisted you were in your office . ”
71518	71533	71560	71560	his	53	“ I am in my office . I ’m just . . . thinking . ”
71540	71545	71560	71560	his	53	“ That sounds ominous . ”
71546	71555	71560	71560	his	53	“ I had an attorney review the contract . ”
71567	71584	71560	71560	his	53	“ Please contain your excitement . I do n’t think my ego can handle such enthusiasm . ”
71606	71611	71603	71603	He	53	“ Talk to me . ”
71626	71638	71639	71639	His	53	“ Just prewedding jitters , dear , nothing to worry about . ”
71653	71661	71639	71639	His	53	“ Getting cold feet , are we ? ”
71683	71700	71665	71665	his	53	“ Are you deliberately talking about me in first - person plural pronoun to irritate me ? ”
71701	71721	71722	71722	I	0	“ I only have to breathe in your presence to irritate you . Now tell me what ’s wrong . ”
71736	71765	71722	71722	I	0	“ It ’s a little overwhelming , this whole thing we ’re doing . I never imagined getting married would be like applying for a line of credit . ”
71766	71773	71774	71774	he	53	“ It ’s always like that , ”
71778	71784	71774	71774	he	53	“ What else is wrong ? ”
71800	71807	71790	71790	He	53	“ Are you speaking from experience ? ”
71820	71827	71813	71813	I	0	“ You ’ve been married before ? ”
71842	71850	71851	71851	He	53	“ No . I have . Not . ”
71886	71893	71879	71879	I	0	“ Are you lying to me ? ”
71922	71938	71879	71879	I	0	“ I. Will . Never . Lie to you . Never . Do you understand ? ”
71949	71964	71965	71965	I	0	“ Sorry . It just sounded like there was more to what you said . ”
71992	71998	71989	71989	he	53	“ I was engaged once . ”
72033	72037	72019	72019	My	0	“ What happened ? ”
72038	72048	72049	72049	he	53	“ She did n’t love me is what happened , ”
72052	72060	72049	72049	he	53	“ She was only after my money ! ”
72087	72094	72095	72095	he	53	“ It ’s different with us , ”
72107	72112	72095	72095	he	53	“ How , exactly ? ”
72121	72127	72113	72113	His	53	“ This time I know . ”
72160	72163	72164	72164	I	0	“ Jax , ”

72174	72200	72201	72201	His	53	“ It ’s ancient history , Bianca . I ’m over it . I would n’t have even mentioned it if you had n’t asked . ”
72211	72237	72201	72201	His	53	“ And I ’m the one who offered this deal , remember ? This was my idea . So do n’t blame yourself for anything . ”
72295	72300	72301	72301	I	0	“ This is crazy , ”
72326	72333	72317	72317	I	0	“ We ca n’t do this . ”
72334	72357	72358	72358	I	0	“ Is that what you ’re going to tell your mother ? That you ca n’t get the money for her surgery ? ”
72373	72380	72381	72381	I	0	“ That is so not fair ! ”
72391	72397	72398	72398	he	1438	“ Life is n’t fair , ”
72402	72479	72398	72398	he	1438	“ This is a business deal , Bianca . A good one for both of us . We ’re not doing favors for each other . No one is getting taken advantage of here . We ’re going into it with our eyes open , fully informed and consenting , with an exit strategy that ’s painless and precise . Which is a hell of a lot more than most people can say about their marriages . ”
72589	72595	72586	72586	Jackson	53	“ What was that noise ? ”
72596	72606	72612	72612	he	53	“ My head and the desk getting better acquainted . ”
72634	72646	72612	72612	he	53	“ Funny , I never pictured you as a drama queen . ”
72665	72673	72674	72674	I	0	“ So what ’s the next step ? ”
72684	72693	72674	72674	I	0	“ Do you own or rent your home ? ”
72708	72711	72703	72703	he	53	“ Rent . ”
72712	72731	72732	72732	He	53	“ Give notice . We need to have you transferred to Rivendell by my birthday on the sixteenth . ”
72742	72754	72732	72732	He	53	“ What about my things ? Furniture , clothes , books ? ”
72755	72800	72801	72801	My	0	“ Pack what you want to keep , and leave the rest . I ’ll send over moving boxes and arrange for a storage unit . If your landlord charges removal fees for anything you leave behind , I ’ll take care of it . ”
72813	72820	72810	72810	Jackson	53	“ Spit it out , Bianca . ”
72821	72832	72732	72732	He	53	“ And the wedding itself ? When will that happen ? ”
72833	72856	72892	72892	he	53	“ As soon as you meet my parents . Ideally we ’ll go this weekend , but if you need to arrange — ”
72857	72866	72867	72867	His	53	“ Wait . Meet your parents ? Go ? ”
72872	72887	72867	72867	His	53	“ We need to make a quick trip to Kentucky before we get married . ”
72902	72917	72892	72892	he	53	“ Oh Lord . Your parents have to approve me , do n’t they ? ”
72927	72940	72924	72924	I	0	“ I have to audition for the role of your fake wife ? ”
72941	72955	72956	72956	I	0	“ It ’s just a formality . They ’re going to love you . ”
73064	73078	73080	73080	Jackson	53	“ I know you ’re thinking again because I can smell something burning , ”
73095	73108	73109	73109	I	0	“ I can have Eeny cover for me for a few days , ”
73150	73167	73131	73131	their	1461	“ Good . We ’ll leave Friday , then . When can I meet your mother ? ”

73543	73552	73536	73536	She	263	“ Hi , Mama . How are you ? ”
73564	73585	73536	73536	She	263	“ I told you this morning I ’m feeling good today , chère . You worry about me too much . ”
73586	73591	73601	73601	her	263	“ That ’s good . ”
73613	73621	73609	73609	She	263	“ Bianca ? What ’s the matter ? ”
73638	73643	73609	73609	She	263	“ Uh . . . ”
73659	73670	73654	73654	I	0	“ There ’s someone I ’d like you to meet . ”
73679	73685	73671	73671	She	263	“ Who , Jackson Boudreaux ? ”
73701	73707	73698	73698	I	0	“ How did you know ? ”
73708	73753	73754	73754	Eeny	56	“ Sweetheart , I ’ve known Eeny for going on fifty years . Did you think she would n’t call me when a man barged into your kitchen and announced you were getting married like you ’d just won the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes ? ”
73778	73811	73775	73775	Mama	64	“ Well , he might have a reputation for being too big for his britches , but the man must have some sense in his head to fall in love with you . ”
73855	73898	73899	73899	She	64	“ Bring him by tomorrow at ten o’clock . And be prepared to leave for a few minutes so I can give him the business . He does n’t get to marry into this family unless he ’s good enough for you . ”
74013	74021	74022	74022	I	0	“ Only one way to find out , ”
74117	74129	74130	74130	she	64	“ Doc Halloran ’s office called yesterday to confirm the surgery , ”
74134	74140	74130	74130	she	64	“ Next Wednesday at nine , ”

74212	74257	74205	74205	She	64	“ As I was saying . In case anything goes wrong , I ’ve gathered all my important documents and put them in a binder . It ’s blue . I ’ll leave it on the kitchen table before we go to the hospital . ”
74267	74270	74205	74205	She	64	“ Documents ? ”
74271	74294	74295	74295	I	0	“ My will . The title to the house . Copies of insurance policies and bank statements . You know , documents . ”
74308	74313	74315	74315	Mama	64	“ Oh , chère , ”
74318	74344	74315	74315	Mama	64	“ Dying is n’t the worst thing that ’s ever happened to me . It ’s just the only thing I wo n’t live through . ”
74345	74356	74357	74357	I	0	“ How many times do I have to tell you ? ”
74364	74370	74357	74357	I	0	“ You ’re not dying ! ”

74559	74565	74555	74555	He	53	“ Bianca . Good morning . ”
74589	74592	74593	74593	I	0	“ Jax , ”

74697	74701	74702	74702	he	53	“ Mrs. Hardwick , ”
74708	74728	74702	74702	he	53	“ It ’s a pleasure to meet you , ma’am . Thank you for inviting me to your home . ”
74751	74786	74743	74743	She	64	“ Forgive me for not standing , Mr. Boudreaux , but I ’ve recently been ill and I ’m a little loosey - goosey on my feet , if you know what I mean . ”
74823	74842	74809	74809	She	64	“ Goodness ! The air must be thin up there , son . Please , take a seat . ”
74858	74866	74868	74868	Jackson	54	“ This is for you , ma’am , ”
74904	74907	74887	74887	He	53	“ Oh . ”
74924	74941	74942	74942	She	64	“ Why , African violets are my favorite ! I have n’t seen these in years ! ”
74953	74962	74944	74944	her	64	“ Bianca , did you think of this ? ”
74972	74983	74968	74968	Jackson	53	“ Your daughter is always thinking of you , ma’am . ”
75042	75055	75030	75030	Mama	64	“ What a lovely surprise . You ’ve just made my day . ”
75076	75101	75069	75069	she	64	“ What can I offer you to drink , Mr. Boudreaux ? Coffee ? Water ? Something stronger , maybe , an Absinthe Suissesse ? ”
75102	75119	75123	75123	them	1486	“ Nothing for me , thank you , ma’am . And please , call me Jackson . ”
75139	75155	75136	75136	Jackson	54	“ I understand Bianca gets her talent in the kitchen from you , Mrs. Hardwick . ”
75165	75210	75211	75211	She	64	“ Oh , I taught her a thing or two , but she ’s got talents I never had . Creativity , that ’s the mark of a true artist ! Like the spring menu she put together for her restaurant , for example . ”
75218	75239	75211	75211	She	64	“ Would n’t you say that was a stroke of genius , Jackson , all those recipes featuring Boudreaux Bourbon ? ”
75246	75263	75243	75243	Jackson	53	“ The menu is incredible , but I think her true genius is actually with people . ”
75273	75285	75269	75269	His	53	“ She knows how to make them feel like they matter . ”
75391	75394	75396	75396	Mama	64	“ Bianca , ”
75411	75426	75427	75427	She	64	“ Would you mind putting these in my bathroom and giving them a drink ? ”
75433	75468	75427	75427	She	64	“ And see if you can find that old photo album from your school days ; I want to show Jackson those pictures from when you won the spelling bee in the fifth grade . ”
75474	75501	75469	75469	Her	64	“ You might have to rummage around in those bookcases in the office for a while , I ca n’t remember exactly where I put it . ”
75734	75741	75742	75742	I	0	“ Slap , slap , kiss , ”
75748	75757	75742	75742	I	0	“ And make it sound believable , Bianca ! ”
75843	75851	75852	75852	I	0	“ Could n’t find the photo album , ”
75860	75868	75852	75852	I	0	“ It ’s probably in the garage . ”
75869	75872	75874	75874	Mama	64	“ Hmm , ”
75876	75883	75874	75874	Mama	64	“ Well , perhaps another time . ”
75996	76013	76014	76014	Jackson	53	“ She gets it from her father , that flush . That and her stubborn streak . ”
76017	76031	76014	76014	Jackson	53	“ She ’s stubborn ? Gosh , ma’am , I had n’t noticed . ”
76123	76149	76119	76120	my mother	263	“ Well . It ’s been so lovely visiting with you , Jackson , but I ’m afraid I ’m feeling a little tired now . ”
76166	76177	76178	76178	I	0	“ Are you okay ? What can I get you ? ”
76191	76227	76186	76186	Mama	64	“ Nothing at all , chère , nothing at all . I ’m just going to go back to bed for a spell . Rest these old bones . Would you lend me a hand ? ”
76263	76272	76274	76274	Jackson	53	“ It ’s been wonderful to meet you , ”
76291	76303	76279	76279	He	53	“ I can see where Bianca gets her beauty and brains . ”
76304	76316	76317	76317	Mama	64	“ And I can see why she likes you so much , ”
76321	76355	76317	76317	Mama	64	“ You remind me an awful lot of her daddy . Crème brûlée , I always called him . Hard as nails on the outside , but inside all soft and gooey sweet . ”
76361	76364	76317	76317	Mama	64	“ Mama ! ”
76365	76376	76408	76408	her	64	“ Oh hush , child , you embarrass too easily . ”
76382	76403	76379	76379	she	64	“ I can trust you to take care of my baby , now , ca n’t I , Jackson Boudreaux ? ”
76466	76477	76462	76462	He	53	“ You can trust me with her life , ma’am . ”
76538	76550	76551	76551	Mama	64	“ Would you just help me to the bedroom , chère ? ”
76554	76558	76551	76551	Mama	64	“ Of course . ”
76559	76572	76573	76573	Jackson	53	“ I ’ll wait for you outside , Bianca . Mrs. Hardwick . ”
76597	76605	76606	76606	He	53	“ I hope to see you soon . ”
76659	76668	76654	76654	Mama	64	“ I owe you an apology , Bianca . ”
76669	76676	76677	76677	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
76688	76715	76683	76683	She	64	“ I overheard what Trace said to you the other day , out on the sidewalk after you both left . I was wrong about him . ”
76716	76721	76722	76722	I	0	“ Oh , Mama , ”
76745	76755	76742	76742	she	64	“ I heard what you told him , too , ”
76787	76818	76771	76771	I	0	“ I thought you were just being spiteful , which he deserved , do n’t get me wrong . But Jackson Boudreaux just asked for my permission to marry you . ”
76863	76936	76860	76860	She	263	“ Do n’t look so traumatized , baby , I said yes . It seems awful fast , but who am I to judge ? It was the same way for me and your daddy . And you ’ve always had your head screwed on straight . I know you would n’t want to marry him unless you were in love , even if you have been tight - lipped about it . ”
76962	76969	76959	76959	I	0	“ Slap , slap , kiss . ”
76982	77009	76978	76978	her	263	“ You mean the old romance trope where two total opposites fight like cats and dogs until they suddenly realize they ’re crazy about each other ? ”
77040	77043	77044	77044	I	0	“ Exactly ! ”
77050	77057	77047	77047	She	263	“ Makes perfect sense to me . ”
77212	77229	77230	77230	I	0	“ I did n’t think having me meet your mother would be so traumatizing for you , ”
77257	77268	77269	77269	she	263	“ You asked my mother for permission to marry me , ”
77272	77276	77269	77269	she	263	“ I did . ”
77293	77305	77306	77306	I	0	“ What would you have done if she ’d said no ? ”
77310	77326	77306	77306	I	0	“ Become one of those panhandlers on the boulevard you said I reminded you of . ”
77327	77334	77335	77335	I	0	“ We would n’t get married ? ”
77368	77394	77395	77395	I	0	“ I would ’ve paid for your mother ’s surgery , and then I would ’ve found a nice , comfortable bridge to live under . ”
77420	77423	77417	77417	she	263	“ Why ? ”
77460	77472	77457	77457	I	0	“ No one should have to die because they ’re broke . ”
77541	77546	77547	77547	Madonna	185	“ Like A Virgin . ”
77550	77556	77547	77547	Madonna	185	“ Feels so good inside . ”
77563	77566	77557	77557	I	0	“ Wait . ”
77575	77583	77567	77567	Bianca	53	“ We ’re going the wrong way . ”
77584	77592	77547	77547	Madonna	185	“ No . We ’re going home . ”
77593	77599	77656	77656	She	1527	“ But my home is — ”
77600	77608	77609	77609	I	0	“ We ’re going to our home , ”
77612	77655	77609	77609	I	0	“ I want you to pick out your room before we leave this weekend . We need to get you settled . And I do n’t want to have to lie to my parents when they ask if we ’re living together . ”
77682	77690	77691	77691	I	0	“ You ’re terrible for my ego , ”
77695	77710	77691	77691	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . This is all just so . . . surreal . ”
77920	77924	77925	77925	I	0	“ I know , ”
77928	77933	77925	77925	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
77948	77980	77938	77938	she	1527	“ You have nothing to apologize for . It ’s me who ’s acting silly . You were right , this is a business deal that we ’re both benefiting from . ”
77988	77995	77981	77981	She	1527	“ I ’m grateful to you . ”
78067	78071	78072	78072	he	117	“ Miss Bianca ! ”
78089	78097	78080	78080	He	117	“ So good to see you again ! ”
78116	78119	78120	78120	She	60	“ Rayford . ”
78149	78155	78156	78156	he	117	“ Why , Miss Bianca , ”
78165	78174	78156	78156	he	117	“ You ’ll make an old man blush . ”
78244	78258	78260	78260	Rayford	117	“ So tell me how it went with your mama and Mr. Boudreaux , ”
78292	78297	78298	78298	Bianca	60	“ It went great , ”
78306	78312	78298	78298	Bianca	60	“ She really liked him . ”
78350	78365	78340	78340	He	117	“ Of course she did . What ’s not to like about Mr. Frownypants ? ”
78384	78391	78392	78392	I	0	“ Let ’s take the elevator , ”
78410	78413	78406	78406	Bianca	60	“ Elevator ? ”
78414	78425	78427	78427	Rayford	117	“ The master of the house enjoys installing unnecessary technology , ”
78443	78465	78438	78438	He	117	“ But now that you ’ll be staying here , maybe you can talk him into finding a more useful hobby . ”
78466	78472	78473	78473	I	0	“ Disposing of dead bodies , ”
78479	78484	78473	78473	I	0	“ Here we are ! ”
78564	78574	78561	78561	he	117	“ I ’ll leave you two rabbits to it ! ”

78620	78623	78616	78616	Bianca	60	“ Rabbits ? ”
78627	78640	78616	78616	Bianca	60	“ I ’d fire him , but he ’s my only friend . ”
78641	78649	78650	78650	she	60	“ I ’m your friend , too , ”
78732	78741	78728	78728	Bianca	60	“ Was that the wrong thing to say ? ”
78742	78754	78728	78728	Bianca	60	“ No . Of course not . Why do you ask ? ”
78755	78771	78728	78728	Bianca	60	“ Because when you get really aggravated , you stab your hands through your hair . ”
78772	78776	78777	78777	She	60	“ I do ? ”
78780	78809	78777	78777	She	60	“ And you bristle . You literally get larger somehow . It ’s freakish . Also you make some very unnerving animal sounds and have serial killer eyes . ”
78810	78815	78816	78816	I	0	“ What a charmer , ”
78821	78828	78829	78829	she	60	“ It ’s not all bad , ”
78859	78863	78853	78853	I	0	“ Do tell . ”
78864	78906	78853	78853	I	0	“ Well . Um . You smell amazing . After you stopped murdering me with your eyes and I got past all the hair and your generally disheveled , hobolike appearance , it was the first thing I noticed about you . ”
78940	78973	78936	78936	her	60	“ And you have a really beautiful voice . If you ever decided not to be a layabout rich person , you could have an incredible career as a phone sex operator . ”

79423	79471	79414	79414	She	60	“ I do n’t know where he gets his energy , sir . I swear it ’s like Sunkist puts cocaine in their orange juice . Every day after breakfast he just starts bouncing off the walls and does n’t stop until he falls asleep at night . ”
79554	79569	79551	79551	I	0	“ What do you think about having Charlie read you a book , buddy ? ”

80629	80726	80621	80621	She	60	“ When you say something thoughtless , my feelings are going to get hurt . That child is the sweetest little boy I ’ve ever met . He wo n’t be a bother . He wo n’t be a burden . I do n’t know how much interaction you ’d like me to have with him , but I would very much like to become his friend , and for you to insinuate that I ’m that heartless that I ’d be put out by living in the same house as him , well . . . ”

80938	80974	80925	80925	He	1579	“ It ’s a voice assistant . It can also read your audiobooks , check the weather , and let you buy things online just by using your voice . The whole house is wired . ”

81005	81031	81002	81002	Jackson	54	“ No . But there is a video option on the touch pad so you can FaceTime with anyone in any room in the house . ”
81041	81058	81037	81037	he	1579	“ You have to accept the incoming call before the video feed activates . No spying . ”

If you like the girl , you can keep her on indefinitely , but you can also interview other candidates next week . . . ”

81651	81684	81642	81642	I	0	“ No . That ’s wonderful . Thank you . I asked Eeny if she could check in on Mama while I was gone , but this is . . . better . ”

81744	81769	81770	81770	Jackson	54	“ No . I ’ve brought the contract . I suppose we should sign it now . And a bourbon would n’t go unappreciated . ”

You ca n’t let me walk in there blind . Just give it to me straight — murder ? Kidnapping ? Sexual abuse ? I swear I wo n’t judge or repeat a word to another living soul . Just tell me why you would ever want to leave somewhere so beautiful . And also why it ’s called a ranch because that is like its own European country . ”

94949	94969	94942	94942	I	0	“ But I think that jacket looks great on him . Not everyone can pull off the vintage look . ”
94982	94985	94986	94986	He	79	“ Indeed . ”
95026	95039	95020	95020	he	79	“ So . Bianca . Jackson tells me you ’re a chef ? ”
95040	95055	95020	95020	he	79	“ That ’s right . I recently opened my first restaurant in New Orleans . ”
95056	95071	95072	95072	I	0	“ How marvelous . I understand your mother was also in the restaurant business ? ”
95092	95117	95081	95081	he	79	“ She had a spot in the Ninth Ward for about twenty years before Hurricane Katrina wiped it out . She retired after that . ”
95122	95137	95118	95118	Brig	79	“ I ’m sorry to hear that . She did n’t want to rebuild ? ”
95138	95148	95155	95155	Brig	79	“ We did n’t have the money to rebuild . ”
95161	95183	95155	95155	Brig	79	“ Well . It ’s wonderful that you ’re carrying on the family tradition . Your mother must be very proud . ”
95320	95366	95312	95312	I	0	“ Oh , she is . But she ’d be proud of me even if I were unemployed and living on food stamps . She ’s not the kind of person who only loves her child unless she ’s following her own definition of success . ”
95405	95428	95401	95401	He	79	“ Of course not . Parents always love their children , even when they make it hard for us to do so . ”
95625	95628	95630	95630	Brig	79	“ Ah ! ”
95632	95640	95630	95630	Brig	79	“ Clemmy , come and meet Bianca . ”
95741	95753	95754	95754	I	0	“ Mrs. Boudreaux . I ’m so happy to meet you . ”
95800	95815	95796	95796	I	0	“ Your home is so beautiful . Thank you so much for having me . ”
95865	95871	95862	95862	she	120	“ Thank you for coming . ”
95894	95937	95891	95891	I	0	“ Your son has been giving me fits since the day I met him , but I know he must get his big heart from you and your husband . I ’m so looking forward to getting to know you both better . ”
95987	95993	95982	95982	she	1853	“ That ’s very kind . ”
96114	96119	96104	96104	He	79	“ Let ’s eat ! ”
96243	96252	96253	96253	Brig	79	“ So you two met at your restaurant ? ”
96290	96318	96319	96319	I	0	“ Yes , we did . Jackson came in to sample my spring menu , which was inspired by Boudreaux Bourbon . Did n’t he mention it ? ”
96326	96338	96319	96319	I	0	“ All the recipes are made with your family ’s bourbon . ”
96354	96357	96358	96358	he	79	“ No , ”
96369	96378	96358	96358	he	79	“ No , he did n’t mention it . ”
96401	96423	96382	96382	Jackson	54	“ It ’s true . In fact , he threatened to sue me for copyright infringement on the family ’s trademark . ”
96449	96457	96437	96437	She	120	“ Oh ! Are you all right ? ”
96486	96489	96490	96490	she	120	“ Sue ? ”
96511	96524	96506	96506	she	120	“ Oh yes . He ’s very protective of the Boudreaux brand . ”
96551	96584	96585	96585	I	0	“ And then , uh , he hired me to cater the Wounded Warrior charity benefit he was hosting at his home when his chef quit at the last minute . . . ”
96624	96645	96616	96616	I	0	“ Which turned out to be an incredibly successful event . You might have read about it in the papers ? ”
96661	96674	96651	96651	I	0	“ He raised a few million dollars to help soldiers in need ? ”
96707	96723	96704	96704	he	1824	“ Well that ’s . . . wonderful . That ’s really wonderful , son . ”
96785	96788	96789	96789	I	0	“ Anyway , ”
96809	96822	96789	96789	I	0	“ That ’s how it all began . Now here we are ! ”
96841	96846	96836	96836	I	0	“ Slap , slap kiss ”
97026	97034	97023	97023	Brig	79	“ Bianca ? Are you all right ? ”
97069	97097	97059	97059	I	0	“ Do n’t mind me . I suppose I ’m just homesick . A few hours away from New Orleans and I ’m all out of sorts . ”
97098	97114	97115	97115	He	79	“ Are you originally from New Orleans ? Your accent is a little . . . ”
97129	97173	97174	97174	Brig	79	“ I know . It ’s a mess . My mama ’s side of the family is Creole , but my daddy was from Alabama . I picked up so much of both their slang and twang my accent ’s all mixed up . ”
97178	97192	97174	97174	Brig	79	“ It sounds just fine to me . What does your father do ? ”
97251	97264	97265	97265	His	79	“ He was an attorney . But he passed away years ago . ”
97269	97282	97283	97283	I	0	“ Oh dear . I ’m sorry to hear that , Bianca . ”
97286	97320	97283	97283	I	0	“ It ’s all right . I miss him like crazy , but I have great memories of him . He was the kindest , most honorable and generous man I ever knew . ”
97330	97335	97326	97326	I	0	“ Aside from Jackson . ”
97414	97418	97419	97419	he	1820	“ More wine ? ”
97446	97452	97432	97432	He	1820	“ Yes . Thank you . ”
97732	97742	97743	97743	I	0	“ Not a word out of you , Boudreaux ! ”
97819	97837	97802	97802	he	53	“ Mother . Father . Please excuse us . I think Bianca and I need to talk . ”
97838	97845	97846	97846	I	0	“ You ’re darn tootin ’ ! ”
97904	97907	97898	97898	He	53	“ Oof ! ”
97918	97958	97916	97916	Brig	79	“ Thank you for the wonderful meal and your hospitality . I ’m sorry if I ’m being rude , and you both seem like lovely people , but now I have to go jerk a knot in someone ’s tail”—I
97961	97985	97916	97916	Brig	79	Jackson—“and depending on how that conversation goes , I may or may not require a bail bondsman . Have yourselves a wonderful evening . ”
98081	98099	98100	98100	I	0	“ Do you have any idea how unfair it is , what you just did to me ? ”
98103	98162	98100	98100	I	0	“ Leaving me totally clueless , acting like a gold star idiot in front of your parents ? This agreement is n’t only about your inheritance , Jackson , it ’s about my mother ’s situation , too ! We ’re supposed to be in this deal together ! Why are n’t you helping me out at all ? ”
98192	98202	98189	98189	he	53	“ Because you ’re doing fine on your own . ”
98217	98260	98203	98203	He	53	“ Are you blind ? Even the servants are laughing at me ! What ’s the big secret here ? What is it that you and everybody else knows that I do n’t ? Just tell me what on earth is going — ”
98261	98267	98268	98268	he	53	“ I killed my brother , ”
98330	98346	98319	98319	his	53	“ Or at least they all think I did . They blame me for it . ”
98361	98369	98358	98358	I	0	“ Oh my God . What happened ? ”
98405	98422	98423	98423	he	53	“ Lincoln and I were twins . He was older by two minutes . Two minutes , ”
98427	98447	98423	98423	he	53	“ You would n’t think one hundred and twenty seconds could make such a difference , but it did . ”
98508	98569	98570	98570	Jackson	53	“ Linc was the golden child from the beginning . The heir and the spare , they jokingly called us , only it was n’t a joke . He could do no wrong . He was better than me at everything . Sports , school , girls . . . everything came easy for him . And I . . . ”
98584	98603	98581	98581	he	53	“ I hated him for it . I hated my own brother . Which made me hate myself . ”
98651	98727	98646	98646	he	53	“ He looked like an angel . Literally , like a Raphael painting of an angel . Blond hair and dimpled cheeks , this smile everyone went crazy for . I was the dark one . The problematic one . The one with a learning disability and a temper so unpredictable they had to put me on medication when I was barely a teenager . I just . . . never . . . fit . ”
98765	98789	98790	98790	Jackson	53	“ Linc was being groomed to take over the company . It was the logical choice , him being eldest and so nice . ”
98808	98863	98799	98799	His	53	“ But the thing was , he was n’t so nice . He was like this perfect , shiny red apple that was riddled with worms and rot on the inside . Only no one could see it . No one could believe that something so pretty could be so corrupt . Except me . ”
98966	99039	98963	98963	He	53	“ Linc used to tell me I was adopted , that I was abandoned by the side of the road by beggars and left to die because I was so ugly and stupid that not even my real parents wanted me . He said Brig and Clemmy were getting tax credits for taking care of a homeless runt . He said I should just kill myself and stop being such a burden . ”
99044	99078	98963	98963	He	53	“ Such a useless , stupid burden . But whenever I complained to my parents , they ’d look at each other with sad eyes and sigh and talk about adjusting my meds . ”
99105	99224	99100	99100	He	53	“ On our fifteenth birthday , our parents threw us a party . Linc got all the attention , of course , and by then I was used to staying out of the way , so I went to the pool house and hid . I guess Linc decided I was embarrassing the family by hiding , because he came to look for me . We argued . It got heated . He called me names , I called him names . He took a swing at me but missed . I stepped out of the way too quickly . He stumbled and fell , cracked his head against the cement coping , and rolled into the pool . ”
99269	99330	99331	99331	He	53	“ I could n’t swim . I was terrified of the water because the one time I ’d tried to learn , Linc held me under when no one was looking and I almost drowned . So I could n’t help him , I could n’t get to him , I couldn’t — I did n’t know what to do . ”
99352	99420	99338	99338	I	0	“ I ran to get my parents , but by the time they got there it was too late . They found him on the bottom of the pool . Later the doctors said he ’d been unconscious when he went in , there was the mark on his face where he ’d fallen , and they all thought . . . they thought I . . . ”
99436	99449	99450	99450	I	0	“ They thought you hit him and pushed him in the pool , ”
99482	99606	99475	99475	He	1916	“ No one ever said that directly , of course . But they never looked at me the same . People started avoiding me . Dozens of kids and their parents were at the party , and from that time on I was shunned . The word got out . You ca n’t be alone with Jackson . Stay away from Jackson . He ’s capable of anything . Then my parents sent me away to boarding school . From there I went directly to college . Which is where I met Christian , by the way , the only real friend I ’ve ever had . By the time I came home from college , my parents and I were basically strangers . ”
99607	99612	99613	99613	I	0	“ Oh , Jackson , ”
99620	99630	99613	99613	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry . That ’s terrible . ”
99651	99656	99657	99657	he	1917	“ It gets better , ”
99743	99749	99733	99733	I	0	“ Her name was Cricket . ”
99795	99941	99942	99942	His	1919	“ Cricket Montgomery . The most beautiful girl in Kentucky , by anyone ’s standards . We were in grade school together before I went away , so I ’d known her for years . Known of her , I should say . Like everyone else , she adored my brother but never paid much attention to me , but a few years after I came back I ran into her at the public library in Louisville . I used to go there all the time to read and escape all the accusing eyes in this house . One day she was browsing for a book in the aisle near the chair I always sat in , and she recognized me and came over and said hello , even though I was trying to hide behind my book . She was really nice to me . ”
99949	99954	99942	99942	His	1919	“ So fucking nice . ”
99969	100009	99965	99965	his	1919	“ I should ’ve known right then . But I was so starved for attention , for anyone to notice me or look at me like I was n’t a murdering freak , that I was completely fucking blind . ”
100041	100118	100033	100033	I	0	“ We started dating . I could n’t believe my good luck . Here was this beautiful , popular girl , choosing me . I was so happy I was delirious . My parents were over the moon . My father started talking about having me take over the business . It was like a dream , everything I ever wanted falling into place . After a year , I proposed . And she said yes . ”
100132	100145	100126	100126	His	1921	“ That evil , scheming , lying , soulless bitch said yes . ”
100205	100312	100313	100313	He	1921	“ It took another year to plan the wedding . Six hundred people were invited , including the governor . It was a zoo . All my parents ’ friends and business associates , all her friends and family , politicians , leaders in the liquor industry , a bunch of other people I did n’t even know . We had it here at Moonstar Ranch , of course . Great location for a wedding . The church was too small for that many guests , so the event coordinator designed this whole fantasy fairy tale theme that ended up costing more than a million dollars . ”
100316	100339	100313	100313	He	1921	“ I found out later the coordinator was one of Cricket ’s college friends . Cricket got a cut of her fee . ”
100354	100369	100350	100350	He	1921	“ Because of course that ’s what it was about all along . Money . ”
100430	100534	100538	100538	his	1921	“ The ceremony was ready to start . The guests were seated . The violinists had begun to play . But the bride was nowhere to be found . The coordinator was having a nervous breakdown . So I went looking for Cricket . I thought she was probably just taking a minute to herself , nerves and all that . I had a hunch she ’d be in the stables because she loved to ride , so that ’s the first place I went . And I was right . . . she was there . And she was getting a ride . ”
100550	100555	100547	100547	I	0	“ Oh , no ! ”
100568	100683	100556	100556	He	1921	“ Oh yes . Right there in the tack room , bent over the saddle stand with her thirty - thousand - dollar wedding dress that I paid for shoved up to her waist , her panties around her ankles . They did n’t see me come in . They just kept fucking and talking , him grunting , ‘ You ’re always gon na be mine , ’ and her crying that she was , that it was all for him , she was doing it for him , for their future , they only had to pretend for a little while longer . Everything became very clear to me . Very clear . ”
100689	100697	100684	100684	His	1923	“ And then I lost my mind . ”
100751	100876	100744	100744	his	1923	“ My hands were around his throat . She was screaming . Screaming at me to stop , I was killing him , but of course that ’s exactly what I intended to do . Kill him . One of her so - called ‘ friends ’ that we hung out with who smiled at me and clapped me on the back every time I paid for dinner . I wanted to kill him with my bare hands . And I would have , I ’m sure of it , but Cricket came at me with a big metal tool used to punch holes in leather and hit me in the face . She had to hit me three times before I let go . “
100944	100956	100939	100939	she	1925	” He broke off and covered his face with his hands . “
100967	100977	100978	100978	I	0	” I said , but he shook his head . “
101011	101070	101006	101006	I	0	” He flopped onto his back and laid there , arms out , chest heaving . Sick and helpless , I went to him , sat on the edge of the bed , and took his hand . It was clammy and trembling . With his eyes closed , he told me the rest in a broken whisper . “
101146	101207	101208	101208	I	0	” I squeezed his hand and vowed that the first thing I was going to do when I got back to New Orleans was have Eeny put a voodoo curse on this nightmare named Cricket Montgomery . Jackson ’s head lolled sideways . His eyelids drifted open . His eyes were unfocused . He was very drunk . He whispered , “
101309	101398	101299	101299	I	0	“ It was Rayford who found me . Credit cards leave a trail . After Linc died he was the only one who would talk to me . Anyway , Cricket and her ‘ friend ’ told everyone they were just talking in the tack room when I came in and went crazy with jealousy . Did n’t matter , I had a death wish to take care of , who cared what story they made up ? But that old bastard Rayford would n’t leave me alone . ”
101407	101414	101299	101299	I	0	“ Stubborn son of a bitch . ”
101415	101419	101420	101420	I	0	“ Oh Jax , ”
101453	101496	101450	101450	Jackson	53	“ The day after the wedding that never was , my mother had a stroke . I did n’t know about it until later , but obviously it was my fault . The humiliation was too much for her . The disappointment . ”
101503	101526	101527	101527	He	53	“ Who could blame her ? With a son like hers , it ’s a miracle she did n’t die from shame . ”
101570	101634	101567	101567	he	53	“ A week after I got to New Orleans , Christian had his legs blown off by a roadside bomb in a hellhole halfway around the world . He was my real brother . The brother who accepted me for who I was . He was the only one who ever did , aside from Rayford . He was my only real friend . ”
101643	101647	101640	101640	his	53	“ And you . ”
101680	101796	101677	101677	Jackson	53	“ Christian had no family , so he came to live with me . He was in so much pain all the time , as much physical pain as I was in emotional pain . He started to drink . He ’d go down to a bar on Bourbon Street and drink during the day , and I ’d go with him . . . nothing better to do , either of us . He met this girl . I knew . . . what she was , of course . . . I knew what she did . But at least it was honest . They both understood . Not like me . . . ”
101839	101914	101814	101814	He	1943	“ She got pregnant . Had a paternity test . It was Christian ’s . He died before Cody was born . Never got to meet his son . Trina signed over her parental rights to me and disappeared . I get a call every once in a while . . . bail money , rent money . . . everyone wanting money . . . all I was ever good for . . . ”
102515	102520	102521	102521	she	2358	“ Yes , Jax , ”
102663	102666	102667	102667	she	2358	“ Please , ”
102670	102680	102667	102667	she	2358	“ Oh , please do n’t stop . More . ”
102707	102717	102718	102718	I	0	“ I need to be inside you , sweetheart , ”
102848	102853	102840	102840	Her	2358	“ I ’m sorry , ”
102926	102929	102918	102918	her	2358	“ Wait ! ”
103012	103031	103008	103008	She	2358	“ So I had this idea yesterday . When you were prancing around showing off all your muscles . ”
103056	103070	103042	103042	I	0	“ That maybe it would be a good idea if we . . . ”
103095	103105	103087	103087	she	2358	“ If we got it out of our systems . ”
103122	103125	103126	103126	I	0	“ It ? ”
103155	103171	103150	103150	Her	2358	“ Do n’t be intentionally obtuse , Jackson . You know exactly what I mean . ”
103253	103288	103245	103245	She	2358	“ It does n’t have to change anything . One time just so we can get past it and put it behind us . And since neither of us has gotten any in forever — ”
103289	103300	103301	103301	I	0	“ I wo n’t be able to have you once , ”
103393	103400	103386	103386	I	0	“ Fuck . Fuck , Bianca ! ”
103437	103453	103434	103434	she	2358	“ Yes . That ’s exactly what you should do , Jax . Fuck Bianca . ”
103626	103632	103623	103623	her	1963	“ You ’re killing me , ”
103636	103644	103645	103645	she	1963	“ Why are you making me beg ? ”
103671	103679	103680	103680	She	1963	“ Why are you suddenly so horny ? ”
103708	103731	103701	103701	Her	1963	“ Because you ’re beautiful , Jackson Boudreaux . Inside and out . I ’m an idiot for not realizing it sooner . ”
103813	103843	103809	103809	I	0	“ I ca n’t . Not only once . I ca n’t risk it being weird after . I could n’t live with myself if I fucked this up . ”
103867	103876	103859	103859	she	1963	“ So it ’s a negotiation , then . ”
103882	103886	103859	103859	she	1963	“ Excuse me ? ”

So now it ’s too late because it is fucked up because I wo n’t be able to have you just once and I ’m going to go fucking insane trying to keep my hands off you now , because to you this was only sex but to me it was a lot more , and you told me I was beautiful ! ”

109836	109858	109826	109826	he	2285	“ You ’re not innocent in all of this , either ! You never even told us we had a grandson ! ”
109883	109939	109940	109940	He	2285	“ Yes , Bianca told me you adopted Christian ’s son , and I ’m damned pissed off that you ’d keep that from us ! You know how much your mother wants grandbabies ! And you could ’ve told me what really happened with Cricket — it would ’ve saved us years of grief ! ”
109947	110037	109940	109940	He	2285	“ Not that it was anything like what you probably went through , of course . I did n’t mean that . Only . . . well , shit , Jackson . You never gave your mother and me a chance to be there for you . You just disappeared , and when Rayford found you , he would n’t tell us anything , either , and we never saw either one of you again ! It was like the two of you went into the witness protection program ! ”

Your mother ’s been on a blood thinner for twenty years because she ’d had a minor stroke before you were born and the doctors were tryin ’ to prevent another one ! Sticky blood runs in her side of the family ! Jesus H. Christ on a crutch , what nonsense ! And this is why you stayed away ? ”
110176	110191	110168	110168	I	0	“ I stayed away because you loved Linc more than you ever loved me ! ”

110242	110254	110255	110256	My father	2285	“ That is a terrible thing to say , and untrue ! ”
110260	110279	110255	110256	My father	2285	“ Well now you ’ve done it . Congratulations , boy . You ’ve made your mother cry . ”
110350	110458	110332	110332	he	2285	“ Now you listen to me real good , son , because I ’m only gon na say this once . We love you . We love you now , we loved you then , we ’ll love you until we die . You ’re our son . We know we were n’t perfect parents , but you were a handful . Maybe we did n’t always know the right way to deal with you , but we never loved you less than your brother . Never . And we never blamed you for his death , either , even though I know you think we did . ”

119915	119968	119969	119969	she	56	“ That ’s better . Now go take a shower and put on some clean clothes . We ’re goin’ to the restaurant . You got people to feed , and I miss that ornery ol’ billy goat Hoyt more than I ever woulda guessed . Do n’t gimme that stink eye ! ”
119977	119992	119969	119969	she	56	“ And if you repeat that to anyone , I ’ll mash your potatoes ! ”

120089	120104	120039	120039	I	0	“ I received a copy of the trust documents from Mr. Boudreaux ’s attorney . ”
120105	120127	120128	120128	I	0	“ Oh . Yes , um , well Mr. Boudreaux and I . . . the contract you reviewed . . . ”
120131	120153	120128	120128	I	0	“ Mr. Boudreaux does n’t want to move forward with the marriage , so the contract is void at this point . ”
120174	120181	120171	120171	He	2191	“ But the trust is n’t . ”
120189	120192	120182	120182	I	0	“ Hmm ? ”

120352	120384	120385	120386	Mr. Roth	222	“ No , that ca n’t be right . The trust is part of the marriage contract . The two go together . Without a marriage , there ’s no money . ”
120405	120478	120385	120386	Mr. Roth	222	“ There is no mention of establishing a trust in the marriage contract , Miss Hardwick . As far as the contract is concerned , the trust does n’t exist . There was only a stipulation that a payment in the amount of one million dollars would be conferred to you upon your marriage , but it never specifically spelled out how that payment would be made . This trust I ’ve just reviewed”—I
120487	120519	120520	120520	I	0	background—“is ironclad . It ’s irrevocable . You are the sole trustee . No one else has access to the money . That million dollars is yours , married or not . ”

120585	120597	120581	120582	Mr. Roth	222	“ I agree . He would n’t . It was intentional . ”
120606	120624	120625	120625	He	222	“ Of course if you do n’t believe me , I advise you to get another opinion . ”
120635	120656	120657	120657	I	0	“ But any attorney will tell you the same thing . Congratulations , Miss Hardwick . You ’re a millionaire . ”

120873	120893	120856	120856	He	71	“ I ’m only going to tell you this one more time , Trace . Stay away from me . ”

120902	120920	120899	120899	he	71	“ You ’ll have Jackson Boudreaux buy up the whole block instead of just the one building ? ”
120921	120930	120943	120943	he	71	“ What the heck are you talking about ? ”

120987	121019	120984	120984	he	71	“ My restaurant ? The building it was going to open in suddenly getting bought up even though it was n’t on the market ? The new owner canceling my lease ? ”
121045	121065	121041	121041	I	0	“ Jackson bought the building where you were going to open your restaurant , and then canceled your lease ? ”

121306	121341	121302	121302	I	0	“ I ’m not Whitney Houston , you silly goose . I need you like the word knife needs the letter k. The only thing you ever gave me was dick and a headache . ”
121354	121361	121362	121362	she	56	“ Who on earth was that ? ”
121369	121391	121362	121362	she	56	“ Snake oil salesman . I told him to find the nearest tall building and go stand out on a ledge . ”

121500	121587	121497	121497	I	0	“ Eeny . Jackson Boudreaux asked my mama for permission to marry me when he did n’t have to . He gave me a seven - carat Tiffany diamond ring when I said I wanted a simple gold band . He gave me a million dollars in cash , for nothing . And bought an entire building so a man who ’d hurt me could n’t hurt me again . And told me his deepest , darkest secrets — things he ’d never told anyone before . ”

If you ’re not careful , you might mistake it for bein ’ boring because it ’s so reliable . Love is warm and deep and comfortable , just right , so you float in it peacefully without ever being scalded or frozen , like a perfect , relaxing bubble bath . “
121949	121962	121968	121968	boo	2281	” Eeny pulled away and gently smoothed a hand over my hair . “
