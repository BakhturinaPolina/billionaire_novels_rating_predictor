741	746	747	747	I	0	“ Is he conscious ? ”
760	784	752	752	she	69	“ Yes . He says he ’s never felt better , but clearly breaking your hip at eighty - two is n’t good . ”
802	810	790	790	She	69	“ He ’s going to be fine . ”
814	825	790	790	She	69	“ Have you had the results of the CT yet ? ”
826	846	862	862	Darcy	69	“ No . You know it took them a couple of hours to convince him to have it done . ”

1849	1875	1835	1835	he	254	“ I really want you to consider an arrangement with Aurora — she cares about our family , and she ’d make an excellent wife . ”
1876	1885	1835	1835	he	254	“ I do n’t want to get married . ”
1942	1974	1930	1930	she	73	“ I ’m sure most men feel like that . And it ’s not like you have to . . . you know . . . live like husband and wife . ”
1975	1984	1985	1986	Fucking Aurora	73	“ That ’s not the point , Darce . ”

2352	2397	2398	2398	She	280	“ Let ’s talk when you get here . Whether we like it or not , Grandfather is eighty - two . You ’re running out of time to think about this . You need to act quickly or it will be too late . ”
2536	2545	2546	2546	Grandfather	70	“ What the hell are you doing here ? ”
2561	2583	2558	2558	I	0	“ Now that ’s not a very nice welcome . I hope you ’re being slightly more charming to the nurses . ”
2600	2640	2590	2590	her	288	“ Everyone is making such a bloody - awful fuss , Ryder . I ’ve been falling over for eighty - two years . I ’m not sure why everyone ’s acting like I ’m on my death bed . ”
2646	2662	2641	2641	I	0	“ You broke your hip , Grandfather . Did you expect no one to care ? ”
2663	2670	2671	2671	Darcy	69	“ They ’re talking about surgery , ”
2681	2687	2677	2677	I	0	“ Surgery ? What for ? ”

2742	2758	2720	2720	I	0	“ I already did . They said surgery almost always follows a fall like this . ”

3064	3078	3061	3061	her	69	“ No doubt there ’ll be more in it for you than them . ”
3082	3111	3079	3079	I	0	“ But there ’ll still be something in it for them . And that ’s the point . I do n’t screw them . I ’m just shrewd . ”

3322	3332	3319	3319	Darcy	69	“ Do you want anything while I ’m gone ? ”
3401	3407	3389	3389	She	69	“ We need to talk , ”
3454	3462	3449	3449	he	196	“ I ’m getting older , Ryder . ”
3518	3551	3514	3514	I	0	“ If you ’re worried about the hip surgery , do n’t be . You heard Darcy ; it ’s perfectly normal after a break . You ’re going to be fine . ”
3552	3566	3567	3567	His	70	“ I need to tell you something before I go in to surgery . ”
3597	3607	3591	3591	him	70	“ It ’s about my investment in Westbury Group . ”
3608	3612	3613	3613	My	0	“ Your investment ? ”
3672	3699	3665	3665	I	0	“ We should have sorted this out a long time ago . I guess I just liked the idea of being an investor in your success . ”
3700	3707	3708	3708	He	70	“ What are you talking about ? ”
3723	3734	3735	3735	He	70	“ Do you need money for the repairs Darcy mentioned ? ”
3805	3815	3816	3816	He	70	“ No , I do n’t want your money . ”
3824	3845	3816	3816	He	70	“ I ’m afraid if your cousin gets his hands on my share , he might have a different view . ”
3862	3879	3880	3880	He	70	“ I ’m not following you . What ’s my business got to do with Frederick ? ”
3919	3924	3925	3925	he	70	“ I ’m fine , ”
3930	3938	3925	3925	he	70	“ You need to take it easy . ”
3939	3946	3947	3947	He	70	“ I said I ’m fine . ”
3971	3998	3955	3955	I	0	“ Do you remember when I invested in Westbury Group ? I took that special share so you would n’t have the burden of a loan ? ”
3999	4005	4006	4006	I	0	“ Yeah , of course . ”
4023	4044	4006	4006	I	0	“ Well , the money came from the estate , and so the share is in the estate ’s name . ”
4045	4049	4050	4050	I	0	“ I remember , ”
4053	4108	4050	4050	I	0	“ Well , a year or so ago I went to Giles to see if there was anything we could do about this blasted succession thing . It ’s not right that you should have to be married to inherit . The estate , Woolton , the title . It ’s all rightfully yours . ”
4158	4183	4147	4147	he	70	“ You know that it ’s not important to me . I have my own money and I can more than look after Darcy . ”
4214	4231	4235	4235	him	70	“ Well , that ’s the point . I ’m not sure it will be yours . ”
4238	4244	4235	4235	him	70	“ What do you mean ? ”
4245	4272	4273	4273	My	0	“ The terms of the trust set out that I ca n’t alter or sell any of the assets of the trust after I turned eighty . ”
4315	4324	4325	4325	I	0	“ Right . I ’m not following you . ”
4351	4370	4371	4371	he	1915	“ So I ca n’t transfer that share back to you . You ca n’t buy me out , ”
4377	4398	4374	4374	I	0	“ So . Your investment has n’t affected the way I run the business at all . Keep the share . ”
4399	4416	4419	4419	he	1915	“ But it ’s not mine . It belongs to the trust . Which means when I die”—I
4422	4427	4419	4419	he	1915	words—“it passes to Frederick . ”
4449	4461	4434	4434	I	0	“ So he ’ll have a minor share . So what ? ”
4462	4477	4478	4478	he	1915	“ Have you looked at the paperwork we put in place at the time ? ”
4641	4661	4630	4630	It	17	“ I ca n’t remember the details . But everything has worked out fine . What ’s the problem ? ”
4662	4705	4630	4630	It	17	“ In order to give you the money from the trust , the share needed to have certain powers . So , if I do n’t like the way you ’re running the group , I can take control of the company . ”
4706	4716	4719	4735	no one in the world who I trusted more than my grandfather to go into business with	338	“ That ’s never been an issue , though . ”
4737	4748	4719	4735	no one in the world who I trusted more than my grandfather to go into business with	338	“ But when the share transfers to Frederick . . . ”
4776	4795	4763	4763	I	0	“ Are you telling me that Frederick is going to be able to take control of my company ? ”
4818	4832	4809	4809	Frederick	72	“ That he could take everything I ’ve worked for all these years ? ”
4833	4851	4852	4852	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , my boy . I never meant for it to be like this . ”
4861	4884	4852	4852	I	0	“ So we change the paperwork , right ? Ca n’t we pass a resolution that changes the rights of that share ? ”
4916	4926	4927	4927	He	196	“ I still own the majority of the company . ”
4932	4978	4929	4929	his	196	“ I wish it were that simple . Once I turned eighty , no changes to investments can be made . I ’m so sorry , I had no idea my investment in your company , in your future , could affect you like this . ”
4990	4997	4979	4979	My	0	“ This is n’t your fault . ”
4998	5018	4979	4979	My	0	“ I should have had Giles do a full review of our assets much sooner , but . . . ”
5034	5041	5042	5042	I	0	“ Do n’t think about it . ”
5104	5122	5123	5123	I	0	“ I ’d like to think that Frederick will do the right thing , but . . . ”
5183	5198	5176	5176	I	0	“ We ’ll find a solution . I ’ll speak to Giles about it . ”
5523	5528	5529	5529	I	0	“ Dinner with Peter . ”
5647	5652	5653	5653	she	79	“ Are you free ? ”
5656	5669	5653	5653	she	79	“ Sure , if you can help me solve my dating dilemma . ”
5734	5747	5748	5748	She	79	“ That sounds like fun . Being married is so boring sometimes . ”
5819	5826	5814	5814	I	0	“ That ’s what Marcus said . ”
6005	6018	6019	6019	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . I was n’t trying to be insensitive . ”
6022	6034	6019	6019	I	0	“ It ’s fine . It was a long time ago . ”
6087	6104	6105	6105	she	384	“ So what ’s your dilemma ? I ’ll share mine if you ’ll share yours ? ”
6122	6134	6135	6135	I	0	“ You have a dating dilemma ? Does your husband know ? ”
6140	6145	6146	6146	she	384	“ I ’m discreet , ”
6152	6158	6146	6146	she	384	“ Come on , spill . ”
6159	6181	6188	6188	her	384	“ I ’m just double - booked , that ’s all . I made dinner plans with Andrew and Peter tonight . ”
6182	6185	6186	6186	She	384	“ Again ? ”
6194	6210	6188	6188	her	384	“ Is n’t that the second double - booking in the last couple of weeks ? ”
6223	6236	6217	6217	I	0	“ Well I guess it means you ’re wanting to see them . ”
6268	6283	6287	6287	them	385	“ It ’s no big deal . I ’ll just cancel one of them . ”
6298	6309	6315	6315	she	79	“ I assume your dilemma ’s not a dating one . ”
6318	6338	6339	6339	She	79	“ No such luck , and it ’s not just my dilemma , either . It ’s yours too . ”
6344	6353	6339	6339	She	79	“ We ’ve had another approach from Westbury . ”
6394	6405	6406	6406	Cecily	79	“ I ’m so sorry we ’re in this situation , ”
6409	6429	6406	6406	Cecily	79	“ Do n’t apologize . We had to have that money and we did n’t have any other offers . ”
6491	6509	6489	6489	hers	79	“ We knew it was a short term thing . Who knew we ’d be this successful ? ”
6556	6565	6610	6610	she	79	“ And Westbury has n’t changed its offer ? ”
6566	6591	6610	6610	she	79	“ It ’s still all or nothing . They take the whole business , they hire us as employees and we lose our shareholding . ”
6602	6609	6610	6610	she	79	“ The money ’s better though , ”
6684	6692	6679	6679	she	79	“ What do you mean , better ? ”
6703	6723	6693	6693	Her	79	“ Enough to pay all the shareholders what we ’d hoped to get at the end of year three . ”
7011	7043	7007	7008	Cecily Fragrance	79	“ What do you think ? You want to walk away ? Give up everything we ’ve worked so hard on and let someone else reap all the success and rewards ? ”
7054	7087	7051	7051	She	405	“ Well , not when you put it like that . But I ’m not sure we have a choice . None of the other offers pay off our loans in full . ”
7167	7185	7155	7155	I	0	“ I understand that you ’d rather see Cecily Fragrance continue without you than fail with you . ”
7294	7320	7321	7321	She	79	“ We may still get other offers , might even be able to use those to increase some of the offers we ’ve already had . ”
7328	7348	7321	7321	She	79	“ Maybe . I just really do n’t want us to go under and we ’d still have jobs . ”
7349	7363	7364	7364	I	0	“ How about I meet with all the bidders and try to negotiate ? ”
7367	7387	7364	7364	I	0	“ I worked for an investment bank . I might have learned a couple of things on the way . ”
7406	7415	7416	7416	she	79	“ You think you might change their minds ? ”
7422	7450	7419	7419	I	0	“ Who knows ? But it ’s worth a try , is n’t it ? We still have some fight left in us , do n’t we ? ”
7461	7480	7455	7455	I	0	“ The next instalment on the loans is due in a month — we do n’t have long . ”
7502	7516	7517	7517	She	79	“ We ca n’t give up , Cecily . This is our baby . ”
7523	7547	7517	7517	She	79	“ It ’s taken so much energy to get this far , I ’m not sure I have enough to finish the race . ”
7548	7574	7575	7575	I	0	“ Well , that ’s why I ’m here . I ’m going to get us both over the finish line . Whatever it takes . ”
7632	7651	7652	7652	Violet	82	“ I hope to God you ’re banging them both . And at the same time every Tuesday , ”
7709	7712	7713	7713	I	0	“ Shhhh , ”
7790	7807	7808	7808	she	82	“ Well , really , what were you doing bringing me to a place like this ? ”
7843	7848	7833	7833	I	0	“ I like it . ”
7849	7852	7853	7853	Violet	82	“ So ? ”
7856	7881	7882	7882	She	82	“ Are you banging them both ? I know it ’s too much to hope that you ’re doing them at the same time . ”
7907	7929	7930	7930	she	82	“ I think I ’d like to try a three - way before I ’m old . Two men , though , ”
7933	7953	7930	7930	she	82	“ I did the two girls and a guy thing in college and it did n’t work for me . ”
7963	7980	7930	7930	she	82	“ Violet . Please . Save me from death by embarrassment . At least for tonight . ”
7981	7996	8068	8068	she	82	“ Well if you answer my question , I ’ll stop over - sharing . ”
7997	8012	8068	8068	she	82	“ No , I ’m not banging them — certainly not both at once . ”
8013	8016	8017	8017	Violet	82	“ Urgh , ”
8020	8059	8017	8017	Violet	82	“ I might have known . Tell me you ’ve fucked someone since your divorce . Please . Tell me your vibrator is n’t the only thing to have given you an orgasm in the last two years . ”
8228	8275	8223	8223	Violet	82	“ I know I ’ve said this all along , but what you need is a one - night stand . You ’re overthinking the sex thing . It ’s just sex . Like brushing your teeth or exercising . It ’s a fact of life . ”
8276	8281	8282	8282	I	0	“ It ’s difficult . ”
8392	8454	8373	8373	I	0	“ It ’s really not . And frankly , if you ’re really nervous you can just lie there while he does all the work . It wo n’t be as good but if that ’s all you can manage , with your banging body and beautiful face , you do n’t need to do anything to get a guy off . ”
8455	8463	8464	8464	I	0	“ Are we really having this conversation ? ”
8494	8559	8486	8486	Violet	82	“ We ’re going to keep having this conversation until you get over this issue you have around your first time , first love thing . Your life is n’t a Coke commercial . No one ’s life is a Coke commercial . And Marcus has gone and he ’s not coming back . Anyway , you know he ’s fucking Cindy Cremantes now . ”
8608	8620	8598	8598	she	85	“ I do n’t think my life is a Coke commercial . ”
8621	8653	8654	8654	She	85	“ I beg to differ . I understand that Marcus is the only guy you ever slept with , but despite this décor , we ’re not actually in the fifties . ”
8662	8693	8654	8654	She	85	“ You ’re not a housewife . You do n’t have to pretend you do n’t like sex . That ’s not what life is like in the modern world . ”
8694	8705	8706	8706	Violet	82	“ I like sex plenty . I ’m not frigid . ”
8709	8730	8706	8706	Violet	82	“ Marcus did n’t leave you because you ’re boring in bed . You do n’t have to be afraid . ”
8731	8737	8738	8738	Marcus	81	“ Yeah , I know . ”
8854	8864	8837	8837	he	81	“ I ’m just not ready for a relationship . ”
8865	8891	8892	8892	she	441	“ Sex is n’t a relationship . You ’re waiting to see if these guys you ’re dating are Mr. Right until you fuck them ? ”
8915	8928	8912	8912	I	0	“ More that I ’m avoiding a relationship by not having sex . ”
8932	8971	8929	8929	She	441	“ Okay . Got it . But you ’re missing out — having sex with someone does n’t mean you ’re having a relationship with them . Not always . What you need is sex with a stranger . ”
9002	9028	9029	9029	Violet	82	“ So how would this one - night stand thing go ? If , in theory , I was prepared to do something like that . ”
9042	9047	9048	9048	She	441	“ Pick a guy . ”
9078	9091	9070	9070	he	445	“ He ’s hot . No wedding ring . Get it done . ”
9107	9122	9128	9132	the man at the bar	448	“ Do n’t be stupid . I ca n’t just pick up a guy . ”
9188	9244	9245	9245	She	455	“ You keep telling me you want to be more adventurous . Now , I think you ’ve got no worries on that score — you’ve just let dipshit Marcus get in your head . But in theory , if you did want to have a one - night stand , he would be perfect . ”
9257	9289	9245	9245	She	455	“ Just find someone to fuck . Someone you ’ll never see again and then when you find someone you really like , you can have a relationship and the sex . ”
9290	9302	9247	9247	her	455	“ I liked Andrew . And Peter , for that matter . ”
9303	9339	9247	9247	her	455	“ Maybe you did . But not enough . Maybe it ’s all the pressure . With a stranger , there ’s no expectation — apart from that you ’re both gon na get laid . ”
9359	9366	9367	9367	Violet	82	“ You ’re doing that thing , ”
9374	9378	9367	9367	Violet	82	“ What thing ? ”
9379	9393	9367	9367	Violet	82	“ The thing where you tap your index finger . It ’s annoying . ”
9394	9399	9400	9400	She	82	“ You ’re annoying . ”
9464	9498	9460	9460	she	82	“ In theory — because there ’s no way I ’m ever going to do it — if I wanted to pick up the guy at the bar , what would I do ? ”
9499	9503	9504	9504	Violet	82	“ In theory ? ”
9525	9544	9507	9507	I	0	“ You would n’t have to do much . Just find a reason to go to the bar . ”
9545	9561	9562	9562	Violet	82	“ Why would I need to go to the bar ? They have table service . ”
9566	9592	9593	9593	She	82	“ I said find a reason . It does n’t matter what it is . Just go to the bar and order an unusual drink . ”
9609	9614	9602	9602	she	82	“ A French 75 . ”
9615	9621	9602	9602	she	82	“ That ’s a cocktail ? ”
9634	9656	9657	9657	she	82	“ A French 75 is the cocktail . How do you live in New York City and not know these things ? ”
9660	9683	9657	9657	she	82	“ It ’s not on the menu , which makes you look cool and sophisticated . And it ’s a talking point . ”
9684	9708	9602	9602	she	82	“ So , I go to the bar , order the drink . And then what ? I ask him to fuck me ? ”
9709	9718	9719	9719	Violet	82	“ Shhh , this is a nice place , ”
9723	9757	9719	9719	Violet	82	“ Just go over , stand close to him . Be open to it . Maybe glance sideways at him . In that dress , it ’s all you ’ll have to do . ”
9785	9793	9794	9794	Violet	82	“ Maybe after I finish my drink . ”
9799	9810	9796	9796	her	82	“ Maybe my ass . You ’ll never do it . ”
9884	9892	9893	9893	I	0	“ Two French 75s coming right up . ”
10063	10074	10075	10077	the handsome guy	469	“ I think he went out back for a second , ”
10126	10129	10123	10123	He	465	“ Hi . ”
10152	10155	10156	10156	His	465	“ Hi . ”
10177	10180	10181	10181	he	465	“ Ryder , ”
10184	10189	10181	10181	he	465	“ Oh . Scarlett . ”
10196	10210	10181	10181	he	465	“ My name that is . I mean , my name is Scarlett . ”
10304	10311	10299	10299	He	465	“ Scarlett ? As in O’Hara ? ”
10312	10319	10301	10301	his	465	“ No , as in King . ”
10335	10343	10332	10332	he	465	“ Scarlett King . I like that . ”
10466	10473	10474	10475	a man	464	“ Sorry to keep you waiting , ”
10498	10516	10517	10517	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett and her friend over there would like a drink . Put it on my bill , ”
10520	10539	10517	10517	Ryder	75	“ That ’s a bit risky . What if I said I was ordering a bottle of Cristal ? ”
10543	10571	10540	10540	I	0	“ I ’d say they do n’t offer it here but the twenty - o - one Krug is excellent . And put it on my bill . ”
10580	10586	10587	10587	Ryder	75	“ Martin . The Krug , ”
10642	10671	10672	10672	I	0	“ Oh , no ! You do n’t have — I really just came over for a couple cocktails . The same again if you do n’t mind , ”
10688	10695	10696	10696	Ryder	75	“ You ’re turning down Krug ? ”
10702	10721	10696	10696	Ryder	75	“ Yeah , this way , I can talk to you without you thinking you bought your time . ”
10727	10741	10724	10724	his	75	“ Now that I can live with . So where shall we start ? ”
10782	10798	10799	10799	he	75	“ Tell me what you ’re discussing so conspiratorially about over there with your friend , ”
10802	10816	10799	10799	he	75	“ You looked like two girls who did n’t want to be interrupted . ”
10860	10864	10865	10865	I	0	“ You first , ”
10868	10886	10865	10865	I	0	“ Why are you here ? Drowning your sorrows ? Bad breakup ? Lost a trillion dollars ? ”
10890	10895	10896	10896	he	75	“ Nothing like that , ”
10906	10929	10896	10896	he	75	“ Trying to keep myself awake so I wake up tomorrow without jet lag . I flew in from London earlier today . ”
10934	10941	10942	10942	I	0	“ You ’re here on business ? ”
10956	10974	10975	10975	I	0	“ I ’m based here and my business is here too . You live in the city ? ”
10978	10986	10975	10975	I	0	“ So you were just visiting London ? ”
10987	11005	11006	11006	I	0	“ Yeah , my grandfather had a fall and so I flew back to check on him . ”
11015	11023	11024	11024	I	0	“ You were visiting your sick grandfather ? ”
11037	11049	11024	11024	I	0	“ Does any girl believe it when you tell them that ? ”
11053	11081	11050	11050	He	485	“ You ’re right . That sounded like a line . But it ’s true . Luckily he ’s fine and you have n’t hurt my feelings . ”
11093	11107	11087	11087	he	485	“ Well , if your grandfather is sick , then I ’m sorry . ”
11130	11134	11135	11135	he	485	“ Thank you , ”
11139	11164	11135	11135	he	485	“ If I was wanting to be cheesy , I ’d ask you to tell me something about yourself that no one else knows . ”
11165	11185	11205	11205	His	485	“ That ’s cheesy ? I think it ’s kinda nice - cheesy . Rather than sleazy - cheesy . ”
11186	11199	11200	11200	His	485	“ Well it ’s good to know which box I ’m in . ”
11277	11296	11297	11297	I	0	“ So , why do n’t you tell me something that no one else knows ? Something real , ”
11323	11345	11346	11346	he	485	“ Sometimes I ca n’t sleep at night because I worry I wo n’t get it all done before I die , ”

11468	11474	11475	11475	I	0	“ Not on a Tuesday , ”
11494	11513	11486	11486	He	485	“ That ’s a good strategy . I ’m going to try it . Now , your turn . ”
11514	11521	11522	11522	My	0	“ Something no one else knows ? ”
11536	11549	11529	11529	Marcus	81	“ I ’m not sure there ’s anything no one else knows . ”

11744	11764	11737	11737	I	0	“ What did you expect ? That he ’d flip me over the bar and fuck me in public ? ”
11765	11768	11769	11769	she	82	“ Maybe , ”
11807	11830	11772	11772	I	0	“ Well at least you ’ve lightened up . Just think how much lighter you ’d be if you ’d fucked him . ”
11831	11840	11876	11877	a man	464	“ Sex is n’t the answer to everything . ”
11852	11864	11865	11865	Violet	82	“ Yeah but good sex makes everything a little bit better , ”
11868	11875	11876	11877	a man	464	“ I could n’t agree more , ”
11902	11909	11910	11910	he	75	“ I think you ’re sexy , ”

12635	12663	12632	12632	I	0	“ No , because you ca n’t possibly know whether I ’m amazing . But I get it . You ’re trying to get me into bed . ”
12688	12711	12712	12712	She	82	“ Well , you ’re right about me trying to seduce you . But I ’m not confessing to the cheeseball thing . ”

16032	16035	16029	16029	She	540	“ Yes . ”

16341	16345	16346	16346	she	540	“ So good , ”
16453	16459	16460	16460	she	540	“ You feel so good , ”
16477	16482	16469	16469	I	0	“ Back at you . ”
16523	16531	16532	16532	I	0	“ You thought I would n’t fit . ”
16538	16547	16532	16532	I	0	“ But you got so wet for me . ”
16602	16609	16610	16610	I	0	“ Tell me what you want , ”

17755	17773	17752	17752	she	540	“ Those things we just did , and you ’re worried about me shutting the bathroom door ? ”
17858	17864	17847	17847	She	540	“ What did you say ? ”
17881	17886	17873	17873	She	540	“ Violet was right . ”

17919	17937	17916	17916	she	540	“ She said it would n’t be as bad as I thought . And it was n’t . ”
17949	17955	17938	17938	I	0	“ What was n’t bad ? ”
17965	17969	17962	17962	she	540	“ The sex . ”
17970	17973	17974	17974	I	0	“ What ? ”
17996	17999	17987	17987	Scarlett	88	“ What ? ”
18000	18010	18011	18011	She	540	“ You expected sex with me to be bad ? ”
18018	18025	18011	18011	She	540	“ Shhh . No , silly . ”
18076	18093	18067	18067	She	540	“ First sex after the divorce . She said I just needed to get it done . ”
18368	18379	18380	18380	John	95	“ What ’s got you in such a bitchy mood ? ”
18422	18441	18442	18442	I	0	“ You ’re the finance guy ; you ’re supposed to know everything . You figure it out , ”
18575	18586	18587	18587	John	95	“ I think I got used for sex last night . ”
18612	18616	18605	18605	I	0	“ Fuck you . ”
18617	18631	18632	18632	I	0	“ No , apparently , you ’re the one getting fucked these days . ”
18635	18650	18632	18632	I	0	“ I think I was like the first sex after her divorce or something . ”
18781	18791	18792	18792	John	95	“ You mean you actually spoke to this one ? ”
18958	18966	18967	18967	I	0	“ Has it ever happened to you ? ”
18989	18995	18996	18996	John	95	“ Been used for sex ? ”
18999	19018	18996	18996	John	95	“ I can only hope so . Why do you care that these women stupidly sleep with you ? ”
19068	19087	19088	19088	he	95	“ I can see your imagination setting off fireworks . Are you seriously wound up by this girl ? ”
19091	19102	19088	19088	he	95	“ Not wound up , no . Just . . . ”
19130	19156	19088	19088	he	95	“ Call her . See if she agrees to a date . Then you ’ll know if she was just using you for your body . ”
19172	19196	19197	19197	I	0	“ Seriously , man , you ’re getting a little doughy around the middle . I do n’t think it was your abs . ”
19212	19222	19223	19223	I	0	“ You wish you had a body like mine , ”
19255	19264	19265	19265	He	95	“ Now , enough with the girl talk . ”
19273	19286	19265	19265	He	95	“ Tell me you ’re going to close Cecily Fragrance this week . ”
19338	19349	19322	19322	I	0	“ I ’m going to settle it at this meeting . ”
19350	19358	19359	19359	I	0	“ You going to up the offer ? ”
19367	19399	19359	19359	I	0	“ I need to convince the two major shareholders to walk away . I just have n’t found a way to make that compelling for them . They ’re being emotional . ”
19547	19556	19532	19532	I	0	“ You want me to come with you ? ”
19557	19570	19510	19512	a new president	616	“ No , thank you . I do n’t need a nursemaid . ”
19571	19589	19532	19532	I	0	“ Well , you seem a little off your game . Maybe it ’s the jet lag . ”
19590	19597	19532	19532	I	0	“ I told you , I — ”
19598	19614	19615	19615	He	616	“ Do n’t get jet lag . I know . Maybe it ’s this woman . ”
19630	19670	19617	19617	his	616	“ Maybe you just need a break . I know you ’re close to your grandfather — why do n’t you take this meeting with Cecily Fragrance and then fly back to England ? Take some time with him ? ”
20019	20031	20032	20032	Karen	97	“ Hey , the guys from the Westbury Group are here , ”
20071	20076	20077	20077	I	0	“ Are you ready ? ”
20097	20103	20104	20104	I	0	“ Do n’t be nervous , ”
20112	20139	20104	20104	I	0	“ Like we said yesterday , just write me a note if you think I ’m missing anything and you do n’t want to speak up . ”
20186	20206	20207	20207	My	0	“ Remember , they still have to use toilet paper , just the same as the rest of us . ”
20313	20322	20323	20323	I	0	“ Right , I think I have everything , ”
20331	20338	20339	20339	Karen	97	“ They ’re in the boardroom , ”
20385	20390	20395	20395	Karen	97	“ How many came ? ”
20391	20394	20395	20395	Karen	97	“ Two , ”
20398	20420	20395	20395	Karen	97	“ There ’s Mr. Westbury , who you were expecting , and his assistant who looks like he just started shaving . ”
20448	20451	20426	20426	I	0	“ Gentleman . ”
20556	20560	20561	20561	he	254	“ Ryder Westbury , ”
20578	20584	20561	20561	he	254	“ Good to see you . ”
20591	20598	20599	20599	I	0	“ Scarlett King , Finance Director , ”
20602	20611	20599	20599	I	0	“ And this is my colleague Karen Chung . ”
20658	20668	20669	20669	Ryder	75	“ We were expecting Cecily . Is she coming ? ”
20711	20728	20729	20729	I	0	“ Cecily asked me to take this meeting . We ’re equal shareholders , after all , ”
20865	20873	20874	20874	Ryder	75	“ Where do you want to start ? ”
20925	20939	20915	20915	he	75	“ I ’ve brought some comparative analysis to help you understand our offer . ”
20987	21005	21006	21006	He	75	“ What is it , Mr. Westbury , that you think we do n’t understand , exactly ? ”
21020	21051	21006	21006	He	75	“ I just wanted to make sure you had some context . Wanted you to see the valuations that this type of business is going for in the current market . ”
21052	21079	21080	21080	I	0	“ You think we have n’t done our research ? I ’m happy to run through our process if that would make you feel more comfortable . ”
21092	21141	21142	21142	Ryder	75	“ We ’ve compared your offer with other valuations in the marketplace . We ’ve conducted a discounted cash flow analysis . We ’ve also examined key economic data for the strength of this sector over the next five years . We understand what the business is worth . ”
21155	21164	21148	21148	his	75	“ I ’m just trying to be helpful . ”
21184	21191	21192	21192	I	0	“ Well , we appreciate it , ”
21195	21209	21192	21192	I	0	“ But we can work out the context of your offer just fine . ”
21210	21225	21167	21167	he	75	“ That ’s great . As I said , just trying to be helpful . ”
21234	21272	21167	21167	he	75	“ And as I said , we appreciate it . But your offer does n’t work for us . We have a vision for the company and we believe we ’re the right people to execute it . ”
21273	21277	21278	21278	Ryder	75	“ I understand , ”
21309	21322	21305	21305	his	75	“ And that ’s why we want you both to stay on . ”
21323	21327	21328	21328	I	0	“ As employees , ”
21445	21487	21433	21433	he	75	“ Well , as you know , Cecily does n’t want to give up the entirety of her shareholding and neither do I. As founding partners , we believe the business will be well served by us retaining an equity stake . ”
21524	21555	21516	21516	he	75	“ And it makes sense for you , because it will keep us motivated as we will have real incentive to ensure that Cecily Fragrance has the best possible future . ”
21588	21598	21599	21599	Ryder	75	“ I ’m going to be honest with you , ”
21637	21710	21718	21718	his	75	“ In my experience , it does n’t work to have the founders of a business retain an equity share . They do n’t understand that they are n’t the ultimate decision - maker . There ’s not enough of a shift in stature . And that leads to an unhappy relationship between the founders and the investors that takes up time and energy better directed toward the future of the business . ”
21758	21782	21783	21783	He	75	“ So , I ’m going to make a very good offer . And it will be as far as I can go . ”
21806	21841	21791	21791	his	75	“ I ’m willing to pay you both a very generous salary to remain with the business , but ultimately , if you want to walk away , I understand and can accept that . ”
21884	21948	21881	21881	he	75	“ I think you should talk to Cecily and think about it carefully . It ’s very generous , as is the cash offer . And I know that the loan repayment is due shortly and that the other offer you have is considerably less attractive than the one I ’ve presented . So please , take some time to think about it . ”
21985	21995	21996	21996	He	75	“ Call me when you ’re ready to agree . ”
22009	22022	21996	21996	He	75	“ We ’re very disappointed this is the position you ’re taking — ”
22023	22026	22027	22027	Ryder	75	“ Brett , ”
22036	22054	22027	22027	Ryder	75	“ Please will you excuse us ? Karen , perhaps you could show Brett to the lobby ? ”
22100	22103	22104	22104	he	75	“ Scarlett , ”
22128	22137	22118	22118	I	0	“ It ’s good to see you again . ”
22170	22180	22160	22160	he	75	“ I had a really good time last night . ”
22196	22211	22212	22212	I	0	“ Ryder , you ’re here on business . Let ’s keep this professional , ”
22215	22225	22212	22212	I	0	“ Please , just give me a few minutes . ”
22226	22229	22230	22230	I	0	“ Professional , ”
22234	22237	22238	22238	he	75	“ Okay , ”
22241	22247	22238	22238	he	75	“ Let ’s talk business . ”
22254	22266	22248	22248	I	0	“ I thought you ’d said all you had to say . ”
22267	22275	22276	22276	He	75	“ I want to level with you . ”
22291	22324	22276	22276	He	75	“ Cecily Fragrance is n’t going to get a better offer . If you do n’t take it , those loans will be called in and you could lose the entire business . ”
22330	22363	22325	22325	I	0	“ Thanks for the explanation of our financial situation . You know , some of us know what we ’re doing around here . I ’m not stupid and neither is Cecily . ”
22364	22400	22401	22401	he	75	“ I know you ’re not stupid . But you ’re bound to be emotional about this business . You helped found it . It ’s understandable . You built it into a great brand , ”
22436	22463	22464	22464	I	0	“ I need you to be rational . To understand that this is a really good offer for you both . You need to take it . ”
22569	22575	22576	22576	Ryder	75	“ What ’s the alternative ? ”
22579	22584	22576	22576	Ryder	75	“ You go under ? ”
22585	22595	22596	22596	I	0	“ I told you , we have other offers , ”
22627	22637	22645	22645	Christ	101	“ But they ’re not as good as mine . ”
22638	22644	22645	22645	Christ	101	“ How do you know ? ”
22669	22689	22690	22690	He	672	“ It ’s my business to know , Scarlett . I know a lot of people in this town . ”
22709	22722	22698	22698	he	672	“ I know enough to know that mine is the best offer . ”
22723	22752	22753	22753	He	672	“ If you ’re right that we ’re being emotional , then you ca n’t solve that with cash . You need to let us retain a stake . ”
22789	22845	22846	22846	He	672	“ Your offer shows that you know this business is a good investment . So , pay off the loan . Take a minority shareholding with new loans and we can repay your investment at a more reasonable rate of interest . Cecily and I created this business . We know what we ’re doing . ”
22853	22886	22850	22850	his	672	“ It requires a different approach to take it to the next level . We ’d have to completely change the way you distribute and what the company should be aiming for . ”
22887	22891	22892	22892	I	0	“ Fuck you , ”
22895	22914	22892	22892	I	0	“ You have no idea what I ’m capable of . Think about it and then call Cecily . ”
22915	22925	22926	22926	he	672	“ You do n’t want to deal with me ? ”
22944	22963	22935	22935	I	0	“ I ca n’t negotiate with you . It ’s not right . You should deal with her . ”
22964	22970	22971	22971	I	0	“ Because of last night ? ”
22984	22994	22995	22995	he	672	“ I ’m crazy from lack of sleep today , ”
23009	23016	22998	22998	I	0	“ Yeah . Me , too . ”
23017	23025	23026	23026	he	672	“ But it was totally worth it , ”
23029	23049	23026	23026	he	672	“ That ’s because this is just another deal for you . For me it ’s my whole life . ”
23050	23055	23056	23056	he	672	“ Your whole life ? ”
23157	23168	23145	23145	I	0	“ It ’s important to me . That ’s all . ”
23180	23196	23145	23145	I	0	“ I like that passion in you . But you ’ll still have a job . ”
23197	23203	23204	23204	I	0	“ It ’s not enough . ”
23233	23260	23225	23225	he	676	“ I wo n’t change my mind , Scarlett . My terms are my terms . I want all of Cecily Fragrance or none of it . ”
23261	23270	23271	23271	I	0	“ We wo n’t change our minds either , ”
23363	23375	23376	23376	He	676	“ I have to go . You ’re making me hard . ”
23404	23413	23414	23414	I	0	“ It ’s been good to see you , ”
23460	23469	23470	23470	John	95	“ Did you close the Cecily Fragrance deal ? ”
23514	23538	23512	23512	Scarlett	89	“ Do I not give you enough to do that you have time to greet me as I come back from my meetings ? ”
23558	23578	23555	23556	Cecily Fragrance	79	“ I was going to the restroom , you dick , but I take it that ’s a no . ”
23579	23602	23603	23603	I	0	“ Well , careful you do n’t piss away the rest of your IQ . Come find me when you ’re done . ”
23946	23955	23956	23956	Giles	76	“ Ryder , thanks for calling me back , ”
23959	23973	23956	23956	Giles	76	“ No problem . You have good news for me , I hope . ”
23989	23995	23956	23956	Giles	76	“ I did warn you . ”
24001	24020	23999	23999	Fuck	102	“ I ’ve spoken to the top barristers . The trust is very clear . I ’m sorry . ”
24021	24030	24031	24031	I	0	“ There must be something we ’re missing , ”
24034	24045	24031	24031	I	0	“ But I think there is a very simple solution . ”
24071	24080	24081	24081	Giles	76	“ You need to find yourself a wife , ”
24095	24107	24084	24084	I	0	“ Well , unfortunately , life ’s just not that simple . ”
24254	24264	24265	24265	he	701	“ Darcy mentioned she thought Aurora would be willing , ”
24301	24308	24309	24309	I	0	“ Aurora ’s not an option , ”
24312	24350	24309	24309	I	0	“ Well , you need to find yourself an option . You ’re a rich , handsome man , Ryder . If you do n’t like Aurora , I ’m sure you can find someone you do . ”
24351	24363	24364	24364	I	0	“ It ’s not like I can look through a catalog , ”
24440	24460	24461	24461	My	0	“ Well you have to decide what you want more — to remain a bachelor or retain your company . ”
24475	24501	24502	24502	Giles	76	“ I suppose there ’s always the small chance that Frederick wo n’t interfere and will just be a silent partner like your grandfather was , ”
24505	24514	24502	24502	Giles	76	“ I think we know that ’s unlikely . ”
24601	24625	24626	24626	I	0	“ It ’s bad enough that he ’s going to get the title and the estate . Is n’t that enough for him ? ”
24629	24650	24626	24626	I	0	“ I ’m afraid to say it , but I do n’t think anything will ever be enough for him . ”
24672	24708	24667	24667	me	0	“ I want you to think about marriage — if not Aurora then I ’m sure if we put our heads together we could find someone else . The sister of a friend or someone . ”
24709	24732	24626	24626	I	0	“ What , and I pay them a ton of money , we have some registry office service and then we divorce ? ”
24739	24758	24759	24759	Giles	76	“ Well , it ’s not quite that simple . The marriage has to last until you inherit , ”
24764	24791	24762	24762	Jesus	101	“ And you ca n’t give Frederick a reason to challenge it . The terms of the trust say that it must be a genuine marriage . ”
24792	24798	24799	24799	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
24802	24829	24799	24799	I	0	“ You ’ll have to live together as man and wife . Go to events together . On holiday . You need to have a marriage . ”
24866	24891	24892	24892	Giles	76	“ Is there anyone you can think of who would respond to a generous payment that I know you ’d be prepared to offer ? ”
24921	24938	24914	24914	I	0	“ Maybe I could ask my assistant ? I pay her well but not that well . ”
24939	24949	24914	24914	I	0	“ Your assistant is married , if you remember . ”
24950	24956	24957	24957	I	0	“ Oh shit , yes . ”
25107	25113	25114	25114	I	0	“ I can ask Darcy , ”
25117	25147	25114	25114	I	0	“ Well , consider if one of Darcy ’s very English friends is the right way to go . Would n’t someone in New York be better for you ? ”
25179	25186	25166	25170	a woman in this town	728	“ Let me think about it . ”
25222	25286	25287	25287	I	0	“ Just do n’t take too long . I know your grandfather just had a fall this time , but I ’m sorry to say that you do n’t know whether it could be more serious next time . And you might not get any warning . If you want to keep control of Westbury Group , you need to get married fast . ”
25290	25295	25287	25287	I	0	“ Thanks , Giles . ”
25354	25363	25364	25364	he	95	“ So , you did n’t close it ? ”
25367	25385	25364	25364	he	95	“ This could be a really good investment for us . What ’s getting in the way ? ”
25411	25445	25446	25446	John	95	“ They want to retain equity . In fact , I think they just want us to play banker — replace the loans at a better rate and let them run the business . ”
25458	25474	25446	25446	John	95	“ That ’s not what we do . We add value by taking management decisions . ”
25475	25486	25487	25487	I	0	“ Err , yes . Thank you for reminding me , ”
25490	25497	25487	25487	I	0	“ But did you remind them ? ”
25498	25504	25516	25516	he	95	“ No , I forgot . ”
25523	25533	25516	25516	he	95	“ Jesus , what ’s the matter with you ? ”
25534	25564	25516	25516	he	95	“ Calm down , Captain Temper . What the fuck has put you in such a shitty mood ? Did your doctor just call to say you have herpes ? ”
25565	25581	25582	25582	John	95	“ Fuck off . I ’m really not in the mood for your bullshit today . ”
25607	25620	25621	25621	I	0	“ Sorry . I ’ve just got some family shit going on . ”
25672	25681	25660	25660	he	95	“ Hey , man . Are you okay ? ”
25682	25702	25703	25703	I	0	“ I ’m fine . I do n’t want to get out my knitting and talk about my feelings . ”
25718	25727	25728	25728	I	0	“ I need to work some shit out . ”
25748	25779	25780	25780	I	0	“ Okay , let me know what I can do . We could always up our offer on Cecily Fragrance . You know we ’ve been holding back a little . ”
25785	25796	25780	25780	I	0	“ Money is n’t going to do it for them . ”
25838	25847	25848	25848	John	95	“ There must be something we can do , ”
25851	25860	25848	25848	John	95	“ The figures look great on this business . ”
25946	25956	25957	25957	John	95	“ You ’re obviously trying to figure it out , ”
26116	26126	26127	26128	my assistant	2090	“ I have Scarlett King in reception for you , ”
26137	26142	26143	26143	I	0	“ Show her in , ”
26158	26168	26153	26153	Scarlett	89	“ Scarlett , how nice to see you again . ”
26313	26327	26328	26328	I	0	“ Thank you for seeing me . I know you must be busy , ”
26347	26359	26360	26360	she	89	“ You said you had a possible solution to our impasse , ”
26506	26510	26511	26511	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
26557	26564	26565	26565	she	2090	“ I do n’t drink tea , ”
26568	26581	26565	26565	she	2090	“ You ’ll like this . It ’s good for the mornings . ”
26614	26621	26622	26622	she	2090	“ I do n’t drink tea , ”
26683	26695	26673	26673	her	2090	“ Drink the tea , Scarlett . You ’ll enjoy it . ”
26710	26718	26702	26702	she	2090	“ I do n’t want the tea . ”
26760	26776	26751	26751	She	2090	“ Fine . I want to hear more about what Cecily Fragrance means to you . ”
26873	26883	26884	26884	I	0	“ Because you ’re thinking of changing your mind ? ”
26893	26903	26904	26904	She	2090	“ Please , Scarlett . Do as I ask . ”
26914	26979	26980	26980	She	2090	“ This is personal . For us both . You do n’t get it because you ’re just like every other suit in this city . It ’s all about profits and margins for you . But for Cecily and me — we like to know that Brenda from marketing ’s son is just off to college and she ’s worried sick for him . ”
26987	27018	26982	26982	her	2090	“ We gave Sean in finance a month off last quarter to go be with his dad while he was dying . This is more than a business for me . ”
27019	27022	27023	27023	She	2090	“ More ? ”
27045	27088	27035	27035	Her	2090	“ It ’s different to what I ’ve had before . I ’m more invested . More fulfilled . And I like it . I want to stay . It ’s my adventure and I ’m not ready to give it up . ”
27176	27190	27191	27191	She	2090	“ Why is this your adventure ? Why is this business so important ? ”
27209	27223	27191	27191	She	2090	“ We ’ve been through all of this . You ’ve heard it . ”
27243	27253	27254	27254	she	2090	“ I told you I was married , right ? ”
27270	27274	27275	27275	I	0	“ Go on , ”
27278	27308	27275	27275	I	0	“ Well , if you must know — he left me to go have a more interesting life . Told me that life mapped out with me was boring . ”
27349	27389	27336	27336	She	2090	“ And I guess this job , creating Cecily Fragrance , was me proving him wrong . Showing him that life was n’t so certain . But it turned into something I did n’t know a job could be . ”
27396	27452	27393	27393	she	2090	“ I mean , I love it . I worked at an investment bank before and this is so much more fun — I have to decide on our notepaper as well as our accounting software . Everything from ensuring the P&L is correct to looking at our production process . Every day is different . ”
27459	27506	27453	27453	She	2090	“ I do n’t want my ex to be right . That the adventure never works out for me . That I ’m destined to be tied to my desk at a financial institution . And I do n’t want that old life for me either . ”
27515	27531	27532	27532	She	2090	“ It ’s not just about him . I want this for myself , too . ”
27544	27556	27536	27536	her	2090	“ I feel like I ’ve had a breakthrough in therapy . ”
27579	27618	27576	27576	she	2090	“ It ’s for me , too . I love where I work . I love that it feels like we ’re creating a sliver of happiness in someone ’s life , creating a memory in the perfume . ”
27665	27675	27676	27676	she	2090	“ You want me to drink the damn tea ? ”
27689	27718	27676	27676	she	2090	“ If that ’s what it takes , I ’ll do it . I ’ll do anything . I just do n’t want to give up this company . ”
27719	27727	27728	27728	I	0	“ Put the cup down , Scarlett , ”
27772	27777	27778	27778	she	2090	“ I mean it , ”
27781	27826	27778	27778	she	2090	“ If you want to have veto over a list of things as long as the Nile , it ’s no problem . I ’ll drink that weird tea every day . Is n’t there some way where we can come to an agreement ? ”
27827	27835	27836	27836	I	0	“ I think maybe there might be , ”
28112	28133	28134	28134	He	768	“ You say you ’re looking for an adventure , that you want me to become Cecily Fragrance ’s financier . ”
28148	28156	28134	28134	He	768	“ Maybe we can help each other . ”
28157	28162	28163	28163	He	768	“ In what way ? ”
28170	28177	28178	28178	he	768	“ You ’re divorced , right ? ”
28215	28229	28230	28230	I	0	“ I ’m not sure what that ’s got to do with anything . ”
28242	28250	28251	28251	he	768	“ Legally divorced , not just separated , ”
28254	28270	28251	28251	he	768	“ I ’m not sure what that has to do with you or Cecily Fragrance . ”
28271	28279	28280	28280	He	768	“ I have a proposal for you . ”
28294	28297	28289	28289	I	0	“ Literally . ”
28322	28345	28303	28303	he	768	“ You need me to keep your business , and I need you to help me save mine . Simple , really . ”
28363	28371	28372	28372	he	768	“ Divorced , not separated , right ? ”
28376	28379	28372	28372	he	768	“ Yes , ”
28388	28403	28380	28380	I	0	“ Though , I ’m not sure what that has to do with anything . ”
28404	28424	28429	28429	I	0	“ Everything . I need a wife — and I think you might be the woman for the job . ”
28485	28491	28492	28492	he	768	“ What do you think ? ”
28525	28533	28534	28534	I	0	“ What do I . . . ? ”
28553	28562	28534	28534	I	0	“ I think I ’m going to leave . ”
28563	28570	28571	28571	Ryder	75	“ I know it ’s sudden , ”
28581	28596	28575	28575	his	75	“ I ’ve not really thought it all through , but it could work . ”
28597	28605	28606	28606	I	0	“ You ’re not making any sense , ”
28639	28646	28633	28633	he	75	“ Maybe it ’s an aneurysm , ”
28658	28684	28652	28652	He	75	“ Please , Scarlett , take a seat . The more I think about this , the more I believe this might be an option . ”
28716	28733	28698	28698	I	0	“ What if I said I ’d pay off Cecily Fragrance ’s loans as you suggested . ”
28757	28762	28797	28797	he	75	“ And in return ? ”
28763	28776	28797	28797	he	75	“ In return , you help me inherit my family ’s estate . ”
28777	28782	28783	28783	I	0	“ By marrying you ? ”
28786	28789	28783	28783	I	0	“ Yes . ”
28843	28861	28835	28835	he	75	“ Let ’s get this straight . You ’re offering me money for . . . sex . ”
28862	28865	28866	28866	His	75	“ What ? ”
28882	28903	28874	28874	I	0	“ Of course not . Jesus , after the other night , you think I have to pay for it ? ”
28904	28925	28926	28926	I	0	“ Quite frankly I have n’t got the slightest clue what ’s going on . I think maybe . . . ”
28942	28952	28926	28926	I	0	“ I ’m talking about marriage . Not sex . ”
28978	28983	28973	28973	He	75	“ Let me explain . ”
28984	28990	28973	28973	He	75	“ This better be good . ”
28991	29005	29006	29006	I	0	“ Please , just listen and let me give you the whole story . ”
29065	29091	29109	29109	he	75	“ My family ’s estate — it ’s wealth , land and property — has been handed down through the generations via the family trust . ”
29103	29108	29109	29109	he	75	“ In each generation , ”
29113	29132	29133	29133	he	75	“ the oldest male inherits the entire estate . Well , not exactly , which is the point , ”
29146	29153	29133	29133	he	75	“ The oldest married male inherits . ”
29159	29185	29156	29156	his	75	“ The whole thing is ludicrous . My older sister should inherit , but the terms of the trust are outdated and old - fashioned . ”
29198	29210	29213	29213	he	75	“ I ’ve never been bothered about the money or title . ”
29216	29219	29213	29213	he	75	“ Title ? ”
29239	29260	29261	29261	He	75	“ The Westbury Group has done well — certainly well enough that I can provide for my mother and sister . ”
29277	29305	29265	29265	his	75	“ Unfortunately , because the initial investment into Westbury came from the family trust , my cousin Frederick could wrest control of my business when he inherits . ”
29320	29344	29265	29265	his	75	“ So , everything I ’ve worked for — my wealth , independence , my own identity — would be taken from me . ”
29352	29363	29364	29364	He	75	“ Just because he ’s married , my cousin inherits . ”
29369	29406	29407	29407	He	75	“ I ca n’t believe after all this time and effort , everything I worked for my entire life is about to be handed over to someone who has n’t worked a single day since birth . ”
29415	29422	29407	29407	He	75	“ I need a way out — ”
29423	29429	29430	29430	He	75	“ Surely a good lawyer — ”
29435	29452	29430	29430	He	75	“ I ’ve spoken to lawyers , they all say the same thing — get married . ”
29464	29469	29455	29455	He	75	“ Ridiculous , right ? ”
29491	29517	29477	29477	I	0	“ Pretty much , but I ’m sure there are plenty of women out there who would line up around the block to marry you . ”
29518	29525	29526	29526	He	75	“ And that ’s the problem . ”
29567	29577	29578	29578	he	75	“ I do n’t want a wife like that , ”
29581	29585	29578	29578	he	75	“ Someone willing ? ”
29586	29593	29594	29594	He	75	“ I get how that sounds . ”
29597	29621	29594	29594	He	75	“ And no , that ’s not what I mean . I do n’t want someone who wants to be married to me . ”
29622	29635	29578	29578	he	75	“ You ’re a sadistic weirdo . You know that , right ? ”
29636	29641	29578	29578	he	75	“ Only on Tuesdays . ”
29650	29660	29578	29578	he	75	“ Well , it ’s Thursday so . . . ”
29661	29769	29578	29578	he	75	“ I do n’t want a wife who has wifely expectations . I do n’t want to be married . I just want my company . I want someone who wants something from me in the same way that I want something from them . I do n’t want someone going into this saying they just want the money , when actually , they want more and I ’m not prepared to give more . Your motivation to do this would fit perfectly . And me writing off the loan , or transferring it to my wife , is much less suspicious than just a cash payment . ”
29770	29777	29578	29578	he	75	“ You want a business transaction . ”
29784	29790	29778	29778	He	780	“ And a divorce afterward ? ”
29791	29814	29578	29578	he	75	“ Yes . I want it to be exactly like a business arrangement . Which is why you are the perfect candidate . ”
29858	29889	29849	29849	him	780	“ But I ’m sure you could find plenty of women who would be prepared to marry you for money . I mean , you ’re easy on the eyes . ”
29902	29914	29897	29897	I	0	“ You ’re offering to pay off the loans in full — ”
29915	29926	29893	29893	his	780	“ Cecily Fragrance will be yours , free and clear . ”
30032	30037	30038	30038	I	0	“ I ca n’t , ”
30064	30073	30059	30059	I	0	“ It ’s just not who I am . ”
30074	30090	30091	30091	he	786	“ It ’s not like I ’d expect you to sleep with me or anything , ”
30094	30114	30091	30091	he	786	“ That sums up everything wrong with your offer . A husband and wife should want to sleep together . ”
30115	30139	30141	30141	he	786	“ Well , I mean , that ’s totally negotiable . I ’m not going to say no , our night together was — ”
30150	30170	30145	30145	I	0	“ Jesus . I ’m certainly not going to sleep with you for money ; who do you think — ”
30171	30187	30188	30188	His	786	“ Sorry , I was trying to be funny . Wrong time , wrong place . ”
30192	30215	30188	30188	His	786	“ Look , I know I ’ve kind of sprung this on you . But please , at least think about it . ”
30234	30250	30251	30251	he	786	“ Weigh up the pros and cons . Think about it like a business deal , ”
30263	30285	30251	30251	he	786	“ You ’d be getting what you want — a debt - free Cecily Fragrance . Surely that ’s worth considering ? ”
30324	30335	30336	30336	Violet	82	“ You ’re quiet . It ’s freaking me out , ”
30339	30345	30336	30336	Violet	82	“ Was the sex bad ? ”
30411	30419	30420	30420	I	0	“ It was . . . complicated , ”
30423	30428	30420	30420	I	0	“ What was complicated ? ”
30455	30460	30461	30461	Violet	82	“ I invited Harper , ”
30464	30469	30461	30461	Violet	82	“ So I see . ”
30515	30526	30527	30527	Harper	83	“ Can we get a bottle of champagne , please ? ”
30539	30544	30545	30545	she	83	“ We ’re celebrating , ”
30562	30588	30545	30545	she	83	“ I ’m so excited ! You popped your post - divorce cherry . And with a British guy ! Tell me all about it . ”
30621	30629	30630	30630	I	0	“ Oh , you want the details , ”
30646	30655	30656	30656	I	0	“ He asked me to marry him today . ”
30681	30685	30686	30686	Harper	83	“ He what ? ”
30689	30696	30686	30686	Harper	83	“ He suggested we get married . ”
30722	30729	30730	30730	Violet	82	“ Like , as a joke ? ”
30733	30741	30742	30742	I	0	“ Is that British slang or something ? ”
30745	30756	30742	30742	I	0	“ No actually , he seriously wants to marry me . ”
30762	30791	30792	30792	Crazy	114	“ Well , you ca n’t get it right every time . There are a lot of crazies out there . Maybe stick to an American next time . ”
30835	30845	30846	30846	Violet	82	“ Okay , spill , how did that happen ? ”
30859	30875	30877	30877	she	210	“ Is he crazy in love with you ? Do you have a magic vagina ? ”
30923	30933	30934	30934	Violet	82	“ How long would you have to stay married ? ”
30940	30952	30937	30937	I	0	“ I have no idea . I did n’t ask him . ”
30953	30964	30965	30965	she	82	“ Why ? You do n’t think that ’s important ? ”
30978	31001	30970	30970	she	82	“ Five minutes or five years — it did n’t matter . I was n’t going to marry him . For money . ”
31002	31015	31016	31016	Violet	82	“ Not even to save your business ? Then you ’re crazy , ”
31019	31034	31016	31016	Violet	82	“ There ’s not much I would n’t do for that kind of cash . ”
31035	31045	31046	31046	Harper	83	“ I ’d definitely do it for five minutes , ”
31052	31062	31046	31046	Harper	83	“ Sign the paperwork and then get it annulled . ”
31063	31075	31076	31076	Violet	82	“ She probably would n’t be able to get it annulled , ”
31088	31097	31076	31076	Violet	82	“ Would n’t work for his trust thingy . ”
31098	31105	31106	31106	Harper	83	“ Divorced then . Who cares ? ”
31109	31113	31114	31114	I	0	“ I care , ”
31117	31142	31114	31114	I	0	“ Divorce is a big deal . Marriage is a big deal . You ca n’t enter into a relationship as a business transaction . ”
31143	31157	31158	31158	Violet	82	“ Of course you can . People have been doing it for centuries , ”
31165	31201	31158	31158	Violet	82	“ You over - romanticize things . Marriage is always a deal . He has something you want , you have something he wants . Every relationship is like that if you think about it . ”
31202	31213	31214	31214	Harper	83	“ You really do take the fun out of everything , ”
31221	31274	31218	31218	her	83	“ I ’m just practical . Years ago men took pretty wives who had a big dowry if they could offer a title and respectability . Cavemen mated with the most fertile women in the village . It ’s always a transaction . This one is just more . . . obvious . ”
31275	31285	31158	31158	Violet	82	“ So you think my marriage was a deal ? ”
31290	31319	31288	31288	her	83	“ I think every marriage is . You wanted Marcus because he promised to keep you safe , got along with our parents and has a nice ass . ”
31320	31359	31218	31218	her	83	“ Violet , you ca n’t boil down the reasons I wanted to marry my ex - husband to safety and a great ass . I loved him . Marriage is supposed to be about loving each other . ”
31360	31382	31383	31383	Harper	83	“ That was just part of the deal , for you — love I mean . It is n’t for everyone . ”
31386	31407	31383	31383	Harper	83	“ You ’re so cynical , Violet . But Max ’s ass was definitely part of the deal for me . ”
31408	31413	31414	31414	Violet	82	“ I am not , ”
31421	31437	31418	31418	her	82	“ What I will be is a lot richer if you give me his number . ”
31438	31460	31461	31461	I	0	“ You ’re saying you ’d marry Ryder — even though you do n’t know him — just for the money ? ”
31480	31495	31496	31496	She	195	“ For serious money ? Of course . I ’d be crazy not to . ”
31532	31544	31545	31545	she	195	“ And anyway , were n’t you looking for an adventure ? ”
31548	31592	31545	31545	she	195	“ Marrying some stranger , it ’s all about the adventure , is n’t it ? And even if it ’s the most boring thing you ’ve ever done , at least you ’ll be left with Cecily Fragrance , which you love . ”
31624	31628	31629	31629	Harper	83	“ I agree , ”
31632	31652	31629	31629	Harper	83	“ I think you should think about it . It ’s not like he ’s paying you for sex . ”
31653	31664	31665	31665	I	0	“ How would I explain that to mom and dad ? ”
31668	31712	31665	31665	I	0	“ They ’d hardly say , ‘ Go ahead sweetheart , whatever makes you happy . ’ They ’ve lived in the same house in Connecticut their whole lives , for Christ ’s sake . They are not exactly all about the adventure . ”
31713	31719	31720	31720	Violet	82	“ Well , first off , ”
31723	31798	31720	31720	Violet	82	“ I ’m not sure what living in Connecticut has got to do with anything . And second , when have they ever told you to do anything other than what makes you happy ? They ’ve never pressured us , never told us our decisions were terrible , or our choices wrong . They ’ve only ever supported and loved us . Do n’t make them the scapegoat just because you ’re scared . ”
31853	31860	31861	31861	Violet	82	“ Weigh the pros and cons , ”
31880	31887	31888	31888	Harper	83	“ You ’d save your business , ”
31891	31906	31907	31907	Violet	82	“ You ’d be doing something crazy for the first time in your life , ”
31910	31920	31907	31907	Violet	82	“ Take a risk . Have a real adventure . ”
31921	31937	31938	31938	I	0	“ But I ’d be on my third marriage when I find the right guy , ”
31941	31949	31938	31938	I	0	“ That ’s a big fucking deal . ”
31950	31955	31956	31956	Harper	83	“ The right guy ? ”
31959	31979	31956	31956	Harper	83	“ Your ex was the ‘ right guy . ’ You thought you were happy with him , right ? ”
31984	31987	31956	31956	Harper	83	“ Very . ”
31988	31992	31993	31993	Harper	83	“ I know . ”
32001	32055	31993	31993	Harper	83	“ What I ’m saying is — just because it did n’t last forever , does n’t mean it was a failure . It was right for the time . No one said the right guy is the man you spend your whole life with . There could be plenty of right guys . ”
32056	32072	32073	32073	Violet	82	“ Plenty of right guys ? Is that the deal you have with our brother ? ”
32077	32080	32081	32081	she	82	“ Maybe , ”
32132	32168	32128	32130	One right guy	811	“ I suppose I could ask him for some more information . I mean , presumably we would n’t have to live together . And it ’s probably only for like three months or something . ”
32169	32172	32173	32173	Violet	82	“ Exactly , ”
32176	32192	32173	32173	Violet	82	“ And if you decide to say no , tell him your sister ’s interested . ”
32715	32718	32719	32719	I	0	“ Ryder ? ”
32754	32757	32758	32758	I	0	“ Hi , ”
32769	32777	32758	32758	I	0	“ Let me get you a drink . ”
32897	32902	32903	32903	I	0	“ Thanks for coming , ”
32928	32941	32943	32943	her	89	“ I ’m hoping you ’ll give me a little more information about this”—she
32947	32952	32943	32943	her	89	air—“arrangement you ’re proposing . ”
32963	32969	32970	32970	She	89	“ Ask anything you like . ”
33053	33061	33062	33062	she	89	“ Let ’s start with the sex , ”
33065	33070	33062	33062	she	89	“ What , now ? ”
33096	33109	33062	33062	she	89	“ I ’d really like you to agree to marry me first . ”
33126	33146	33123	33123	my	0	“ What ? No . If we get married , do you expect me to have sex with you ? ”
33156	33177	33123	33123	my	0	“ There is no expectation from my perspective . And I think it would be good to keep things simple . ”
33178	33197	33237	33237	She	835	“ Would I be able to date other men ? I assume we ’d have to live together ? ”
33224	33236	33237	33237	She	835	“ Why do n’t I give you a little more background ? ”
33244	33310	33237	33237	She	835	“ When my grandfather passes , I must be married — and the marriage has to appear genuine . Should our arrangement ever be challenged , the courts would look at things like living arrangements , trips together and any gifts exchanged . So yes , we have to live in the same place , but that does n’t mean our lives have to change . ”
33320	33396	33311	33311	I	0	“ My lawyer says that the more questions we can head off at the beginning the better . He ’s suggested a public wedding in England — no elopement . We do n’t have to make a huge affair of it , but friends and family should go . If we fly over a week ahead of time , that will give people enough time to get to know you — and buy into us . ”
33397	33404	33405	33405	she	836	“ You ’ve thought about this , ”
33411	33423	33405	33405	she	836	“ My grandfather ’s health is deteriorating , when he dies — ”
33439	33449	33424	33424	I	0	“ I could lose everything I ’ve worked for . ”
33450	33455	33456	33456	she	836	“ So could I , ”
33459	33469	33456	33456	she	836	“ Exactly why this works for both of us . ”
33489	33509	33510	33510	she	836	“ I ’m not sure a week with your family , faking our relationship , would be so easy , ”
33521	33537	33510	33510	she	836	“ I ’m a terrible liar — people are bound to see right through me . ”
33538	33543	33544	33544	I	0	“ You ’re American . ”
33552	33561	33544	33544	I	0	“ We can blame a lot on that . ”
33570	33583	33584	33584	she	836	“ Oh my God . Are we really thinking about doing this ? ”
33593	33599	33600	33600	She	836	“ I really hope so . ”
33615	33626	33600	33600	She	836	“ How long ? I do n’t think you said . ”
33627	33631	33653	33653	her	836	“ Three months — ”
33632	33635	33636	33636	She	836	“ Okay . ”
33641	33650	33638	33638	her	836	“ Three months minimum after my grandfather dies . ”
33656	33682	33653	33653	her	836	“ Is that likely to happen . . . How soon — God , I ’m sorry , I do n’t know how to ask . ”
33710	33732	33704	33704	she	836	“ Well , he ’s eighty - two . Divorce proceedings ca n’t be finalized for three months after . . . ”
33733	33761	33704	33704	she	836	“ He could live another twenty years ! There ’s no way I ’m staying married to you for decades — it ’s just not worth it . ”
33762	33767	33768	33768	I	0	“ Gee , thanks , ”
33783	33797	33771	33771	She	836	“ You ca n’t seriously expect me just to go along with that . ”
33840	33844	33845	33845	I	0	“ Five years , ”
33860	33891	33848	33848	she	836	“ Five years and if he hasn’t — if the estate has n’t passed to me by then , we can either renegotiate , or I ’ll find someone else . ”
33892	33905	33848	33848	she	836	“ Five years is a long time , Ryder . Too long . ”
33919	33929	33930	33930	She	836	“ Three years . That ’s my final offer . ”
33953	33973	33949	33949	she	836	“ We move in together here in New York and you travel with me when I go to England . ”
33974	33984	33985	33985	she	836	“ I have always wanted to go to England , ”
33999	34007	34008	34008	she	836	“ What did you say about dating ? ”
34011	34027	34028	34028	I	0	“ I ca n’t take any risks that my cousin could then use against me , ”
34040	34045	34046	34046	She	836	“ So no dating . ”
34059	34079	34051	34051	she	836	“ Okay , maybe that would n’t be such a bad thing . I ’m terrible at it anyway . ”
34095	34109	34110	34110	she	836	“ But if I ’m going to be celibate , so are you , ”
34113	34128	34110	34110	she	836	“ I do n’t want to find out you ’ve got sexist double standards . ”
34155	34158	34159	34159	I	0	“ Okay , ”
34181	34190	34159	34159	I	0	“ I ’ll write it into the contract . ”
34211	34222	34223	34223	I	0	“ Okay . When do you want to do this ? ”
34243	34260	34236	34236	I	0	“ You mean when do we sign the contract ? Or when do we get married ? ”
34261	34317	34318	34318	She	845	“ All of it . But I want my lawyers to look things over . I want you to replace the loans by the end of next week and have it written in that your loans transfer to me automatically at the end of three years or on our divorce , whichever is the earlier . ”
34343	34355	34356	34356	She	845	“ And , I get to pick the ring , right ? ”
34367	34375	34359	34359	she	845	“ I ’m a sucker for jewelry . ”
34376	34379	34359	34359	she	845	“ Sure . ”
34389	34418	34359	34359	she	845	“ If I have to wear it , I do n’t want it to be ugly . And of course , we can sell it at the end . ”
34419	34428	34429	34429	I	0	“ You can keep the ring , Scarlett . ”
34489	34497	34498	34498	Scarlett	89	“ But you do n’t own it ? ”
34507	34522	34523	34523	She	89	“ No , it ’s too much responsibility — and a little too flash . ”
34526	34551	34523	34523	She	89	“ So it ’s too flashy to own a private plane , but not too flashy to ride in one every time you fly ? ”
34552	34558	34559	34559	I	0	“ It ’s all relative , ”
34583	34592	34593	34593	she	89	“ You do n’t have to entertain me , ”
34596	34603	34593	34593	she	89	“ It ’s a long flight . ”
34604	34623	34624	34624	I	0	“ I know . This is where I normally sit . Well actually , I mostly sit there , ”
34632	34651	34624	34624	I	0	“ But I ’m just as good with this seat . And anyway , we need to talk . ”
34689	34694	34695	34695	she	89	“ You want one ? ”
34717	34728	34729	34729	she	89	“ Okay . What do you want to talk about ? ”
34740	34779	34780	34780	She	89	“ Nothing specific . But as you ’re going to be meeting all my friends and family in the days ahead of the wedding , we need to get to know each other . Get our story straight . ”
34787	34798	34780	34780	She	89	“ I told you , I ’m a terrible liar . ”
34799	34830	34729	34729	she	89	“ Then we ’ll stick as close to the truth as we can . What we do n’t want is Frederick challenging the legitimacy of our relationship in the courts . ”
34831	34848	34780	34780	She	89	“ Okay , well , you tell me what to say and I ’ll say it . ”
34864	34895	34896	34896	She	854	“ I want to make sure you ’re comfortable . We need to decide how we met and how long we ’ve known each other . That kind of thing . ”
34917	34920	34921	34921	she	854	“ Okay , ”
34941	34949	34950	34950	I	0	“ You ’re going to be okay , ”
34971	34985	34986	34986	I	0	“ I ’ll be fine once we ’re up and I ’m drunk . ”
34999	35004	35005	35005	I	0	“ You ’re back , ”
35016	35031	35032	35032	she	854	“ We can say we met because you were interested in buying Cecily Fragrance , ”
35042	35049	35050	35050	I	0	“ That ’s kind of true . ”
35075	35082	35083	35083	she	854	“ You know what I mean , ”
35092	35118	35083	35083	she	854	“ Okay , but we ca n’t say we met a few weeks ago . No one is going to buy a relationship that new . ”
35119	35142	35144	35144	I	0	“ I ’ve only owned Cecily Fragrance for two years , so we ca n’t have known each other longer than that . ”
35170	35180	35181	35181	she	854	“ Do you always wear formal shirts and suits ? ”
35190	35198	35199	35199	I	0	“ I came straight from the office , ”
35202	35212	35199	35199	I	0	“ I ’ve never seen you in anything else . ”
35213	35220	35221	35221	I	0	“ Now that ’s not true . ”
35224	35232	35221	35221	I	0	“ You ’ve seen me in nothing . ”
35241	35248	35221	35221	I	0	“ You know what I mean . ”
35249	35262	35263	35263	I	0	“ What about if I met you years ago at a party ? ”
35266	35272	35273	35273	she	854	“ What kind of party ? ”
35284	35315	35281	35281	I	0	“ A Christmas party . In Manhattan . I saw you and came over to talk to you . I asked you out and you told me you were married . ”
35316	35324	35325	35325	She	854	“ You did n’t see the ring ? ”
35342	35352	35353	35353	I	0	“ I was too dazzled by your beautiful smile , ”
35366	35374	35375	35375	I	0	“ There ’s no missing that ring , ”
35385	35393	35394	35394	she	854	“ You think it ’s too big ? ”
35397	35408	35394	35394	she	854	“ It ’s a lot bigger than my last one . ”
35444	35474	35475	35475	She	854	“ The British do n’t do big engagement rings . That ’s large enough to look authentically American , but small enough people wo n’t think we ’re flash . ”
35490	35518	35480	35480	she	854	“ I like it — it ’s Harry Winston for crying out loud ! But it ’s also art deco , a classic and very New York . ”
35519	35532	35533	35533	She	854	“ You better love it . I dropped six figures on it . ”
35558	35575	35540	35540	her	854	“ So you met me at a party , you crashed and burned . Then what ? ”
35576	35605	35540	35540	her	854	“ Then nothing . I met you again a year ago when I wanted to invest in Cecily Fragrance . Brutal negotiator , you turned down my offer — ”
35606	35612	35613	35613	She	854	“ But accepted the date . ”
35616	35634	35613	35613	She	854	“ I like it . It sounds romantic . Did I remember you ? From the party ? ”
35635	35651	35540	35540	her	854	“ Of course you remembered me . I was the guy you could n’t forget . ”
35701	35718	35696	35696	She	854	“ No . No one I know would go for that . I loved my husband . ”
35767	35782	35783	35783	Her	854	“ Okay , so I remembered you , but you forgot all about me . ”
35788	35801	35783	35783	Her	854	“ Sounds good . And why did you want to marry me ? ”
35802	35814	35815	35815	She	854	“ You told me we would n’t have sex before marriage . ”
35828	35839	35820	35820	herself	854	“ Can I get you drinks ? Champagne to celebrate ? ”
35879	35887	35888	35888	Scarlett	89	“ Yes , that would be great . ”
35917	35924	35925	35925	Scarlett	89	“ The start of the celebrations , ”
35928	35939	35925	35925	Scarlett	89	“ So , really , why are we getting married ? ”
35940	35947	35948	35948	I	0	“ You ’re the right girl , ”
35959	35966	35953	35953	She	89	“ Is it really that simple ? ”
35967	35990	35991	35991	She	89	“ You tell me . You ’re the one who ’s been married before . Why did you marry your first husband ? ”
36009	36041	36042	36042	I	0	“ I do n’t see how that ’s relevant . So , I guess , we ’re just in love . Never felt like this before blah , blah , blah . ”
36045	36067	36042	36042	I	0	“ Well , if you left out the blah , blah , blah , I think it might be more convincing . ”
36076	36088	36089	36089	I	0	“ I did n’t want to lose you a second time , ”
36105	36108	36092	36092	She	89	“ What ? ”
36109	36159	36092	36092	She	89	“ That ’s why I asked you to marry me . I knew when I met you at that party years ago that you were special , and I always regretted that I ’d met you too late . I was n’t about to let you slip away again . ”
36160	36167	36098	36098	her	89	“ You ’re quite the storyteller . ”
36168	36176	36092	36092	She	89	“ You think it ’s too much ? ”
36177	36186	36187	36187	She	89	“ I think it sounds like a fairytale . ”
36205	36210	36211	36211	she	89	“ A beautiful story , ”
36214	36223	36211	36211	she	89	“ So yes , let ’s say that . ”
36287	36295	36280	36280	She	89	“ Where did you go to college ? ”
36296	36301	36280	36280	She	89	“ Yale . You ? ”
36302	36305	36306	36306	she	89	“ Princeton , ”
36309	36315	36306	36306	she	89	“ Did you like it ? ”
36316	36339	36280	36280	She	89	“ It was close to home and by then I was already dating my ex — we went to high school together . ”
36340	36343	36306	36306	she	89	“ Right . ”
36359	36378	36379	36379	I	0	“ But yeah , college was good . All those hormones and lack of boundaries . You know ? ”
36382	36397	36379	36379	I	0	“ But I went home most weekends . He was at a local school . ”
36424	36447	36412	36412	She	89	“ What about you ? Your family ’s from England , yet you went to college here ? Did your parents move ? ”
36448	36464	36412	36412	She	89	“ No . I wanted to go to school here . I boarded from twelve . ”
36465	36483	36412	36412	She	89	“ Wow , you were a long way away from home . It did n’t bother you ? ”
36484	36507	36412	36412	She	89	“ I did n’t like being away from my sister , but she was older and was away boarding in England anyway . ”
36508	36516	36412	36412	She	89	“ You did n’t miss your parents ? ”
36517	36520	36521	36521	I	0	“ Nope . ”
36529	36557	36521	36521	I	0	“ My mother was less of a parent and more of a dependent . My father was never around — he disappeared when we were quite young . ”
36565	36596	36597	36597	She	89	“ School was good , and during the holidays Darcy and I had my grandparents . He was more a parent to us than our mother and father ever were . ”
36610	36621	36601	36601	she	89	“ And you ’re close with Darcy ? Even now ? ”
36622	36644	36601	36601	she	89	“ Yeah . She ’s crazy , but sweet and protective and everything I could ever want in a big sister . ”
36650	36668	36669	36669	I	0	“ I ’m close with my brother and sister as well . We have that in common . ”
36681	36688	36601	36601	she	89	“ What are their names again ? ”
36689	36756	36601	36601	she	89	“ Violet , who you met at the bar that night . She ’s the more bohemian of the three of us . Always has a different job , always willing to try new things . She ’s a free spirit . My brother Max is older . Super protective . He became a father when he was in college , had to grow up fast . ”
36757	36762	36601	36601	she	89	“ Are they married ? ”
36763	36778	36779	36779	She	89	“ Violet , no . I ’m not sure she ’ll ever get married . ”
36792	36811	36812	36812	She	89	“ But Max married Harper a few years back — and they all know the truth about this . ”
36823	36883	36812	36812	She	89	“ Violet and Harper actually talked me into it . Max was n’t so supportive . He tried to give me the money to pay off the Cecily Fragrance loans , but there was no way I was going to accept that . In the end he gave in and accepted my choice — because he ’s a marshmallow . ”
36893	36916	36887	36887	she	89	“ Gruff on the outside only . He ’ll do anything for the three of us so long as we ’re happy . ”
37020	37026	37027	37027	I	0	“ Thanks for doing this , ”
37033	37042	37030	37030	She	89	“ Thanks for helping me save Cecily Fragrance . ”
37144	37153	37154	37154	I	0	“ So your sister lives with your grandfather ? ”
37157	37165	37154	37154	I	0	“ Is n’t that kind of weird ? ”
37199	37234	37235	37235	His	880	“ It ’s my family ’s country home , so it ’s not like we ’re sharing bathrooms . You can go days without seeing anyone , though we do normally have dinner together . ”
37401	37408	37409	37409	I	0	“ It ’s like Downton Abbey , ”
37510	37517	37518	37518	Ryder	75	“ Capability Brown designed the gardens , ”
37574	37579	37580	37580	I	0	“ It ’s huge , ”
37583	37587	37580	37580	I	0	“ And old . ”
37588	37596	37637	37637	Ryder	75	“ It takes a lot of upkeep . ”
37597	37606	37607	37607	He	75	“ I guess you have staff to help . ”
37610	37629	37607	37607	He	75	“ We have it down to just five full time , some part - time people as well . ”
37630	37633	37634	37634	I	0	“ Right , ”
37713	37723	37724	37724	he	75	“ Lane here looks after us all very well , ”
37732	37780	37724	37724	he	75	“ He runs the place , along with the housekeeper . We also have a cook , a gamekeeper and a gardener . We have to bring in extra hands from time to time . The wedding will mean there are lots of additional people milling about . ”
37781	37791	37853	37853	he	75	“ I thought we agreed on low - key . ”
37792	37802	37803	37803	he	75	“ Oh , well , yes , of course , ”
37824	37851	37803	37803	he	75	“ We wo n’t go off the estate for anything . We can do the service in the chapel and use the ballroom for the reception . ”
37856	37862	37853	37853	he	75	“ You own a chapel ? ”
37863	37879	37853	37853	he	75	“ On the grounds . It does n’t really get used since my grandmother died . ”
37880	37885	37887	37887	he	75	“ And a ballroom ? ”
37908	37924	37900	37900	Ryder	75	“ That ’s standard in a house like this . It ’s no big deal . ”
38129	38135	38136	38136	Ryder	75	“ Hi , Mrs. MacBee , ”
38159	38165	38155	38155	she	906	“ Is that your mother ? ”
38166	38169	38170	38170	he	75	“ No , ”
38176	38197	38170	38170	he	75	“ That ’s Mrs. MacBee , our housekeeper . Do n’t worry , her bark is worse than her bite . ”
38214	38220	38221	38221	Ryder	75	“ I ’ll do these , ”
38224	38234	38221	38221	Ryder	75	“ No , sir . It ’s my job . ”
38262	38273	38274	38274	she	125	“ You did n’t let me have your dietary requirements , ”
38284	38294	38295	38295	he	75	“ Good to see you too , Mrs. MacBee , ”
38301	38311	38312	38312	He	75	“ Let me introduce you to Miss Scarlett King . ”
38334	38343	38344	38345	Mrs. MacBee	125	“ How do you do , Miss King ? ”
38369	38377	38360	38360	I	0	“ Oh , please call me Scarlett . ”
38391	38397	38398	38398	she	125	“ Welcome , Miss King , ”
38436	38444	38445	38445	he	75	“ It ’s good to be home , ”
38487	38497	38498	38498	Ryder	75	“ This is my favorite view in the world , ”
38501	38506	38498	38498	Ryder	75	“ It ’s beautiful . ”
38507	38516	38517	38517	Ryder	75	“ Come and I ’ll show you around , ”
38536	38539	38540	38540	Ryder	75	“ Grandfather , ”
38591	38606	38607	38607	He	920	“ Ryder , my dear boy , it ’s so good to see you . ”
38625	38634	38607	38607	He	920	“ Even better that you brought your bride . ”
38659	38667	38668	38668	Ryder	75	“ Should you be out of bed ? ”
38683	38706	38707	38707	He	490	“ Do n’t you start . I ’m here to meet my soon - to - be granddaughter - in - law . ”
38767	38781	38782	38782	he	490	“ You have no idea how grateful I am to have you here , ”
38785	38798	38782	38782	he	490	“ You ’re a very good girl helping my grandson like this . ”
38820	38831	38832	38833	His grandfather	490	“ It ’s so good to meet you , sir . ”
38870	38877	38878	38879	Mrs. MacBee	125	“ His Grace needs to rest , ”
38904	38913	38914	38915	Mrs. MacBee	125	“ I ’ll show you to your rooms , ”
38918	38935	38914	38915	Mrs. MacBee	125	“ I ’ve put Scarlett in the East Wing , and you have your old room . ”
38936	38945	38946	38946	Ryder	75	“ Nonsense ! This is a new millennium , ”
38951	38960	38946	38946	Ryder	75	“ Ryder and Scarlett will share his room . ”
39015	39022	39011	39012	Mrs. MacBee	125	“ Before the wedding , I — ”
39023	39040	39041	39041	Ryder	75	“ I may be old and tired , but I ’m still the duke around here , ”
39051	39058	39059	39059	she	125	“ Very good , Your Grace , ”
39091	39102	39084	39084	he	75	“ They ’ve been bickering like this my whole life . ”
39116	39125	39126	39126	Ryder	75	“ Can I help you upstairs , Grandfather ? ”
39129	39184	39185	39185	Ryder	75	“ No , no , no . I ’m just leaning and then I can manage to get to the library . You two get settled in and I shall see you for dinner . Seven sharp . Some of the family insisted on inviting themselves so it will be in the dining room . ”
39188	39194	39185	39185	Ryder	75	“ Some of the family ? ”
39195	39212	39213	39213	Ryder	75	“ It could n’t be helped . Frederick and Victoria want to meet the lovely Scarlett . ”
39223	39241	39242	39242	He	928	“ You knew that they ’d doubt you . This is the gauntlet you have to run . ”
39265	39282	39259	39259	He	928	“ But run it you will . And you ’ll come out stronger in the end . ”
39295	39310	39291	39292	Mrs. MacBee	125	“ Mr. Merriman has been shooting . So it will be pheasant for dinner . ”
39319	39335	39336	39336	She	125	“ Let me know if I can get you anything to make you more comfortable . ”
39360	39372	39349	39349	Ryder	75	“ This place , Ryder . You should have told me . ”
39389	39399	39400	39400	he	75	“ It ’s just home to me . Come , ”
39410	39421	39400	39400	he	75	“ Let me show you where we ’ll be sleeping . ”
39490	39497	39498	39498	I	0	“ How old is this place ? ”
39501	39539	39498	39498	I	0	“ Mainly late seventeenth century . Different parts were built at different times . This entrance hall is gothic , and one of my favorite parts of the house . Do you like this period of architecture ? ”
39543	39547	39540	39540	I	0	“ I guess . ”
39641	39657	39636	39636	Ryder	75	“ Mrs. MacBee called your grandfather ‘ Your Grace . ’ What was that about ? ”
39658	39668	39669	39669	I	0	“ Oh , she ’s just formal like that . ”
39675	39691	39669	39669	I	0	“ You know , because technically , that ’s how you should address a duke . ”
39702	39712	39692	39692	I	0	“ A duke ? Your grandfather ’s a duke ? ”
39713	39720	39721	39721	he	75	“ I did n’t mention it ? ”
39743	39750	39721	39721	he	75	“ No , you did n’t . ”
39759	39768	39769	39769	I	0	“ I should have called him Your Grace ? ”
39772	39782	39769	39769	I	0	“ And now I look like the stupid American ? ”
39783	39797	39798	39798	I	0	“ It ’s no big deal . Grandfather does n’t stand on ceremony . ”
39823	39853	39815	39815	Me	0	“ Ryder , it is a big deal to me — you have to tell me these things . I do n’t want to offend or disrespect your family . ”
39854	39885	39889	39889	his	75	“ Okay , I ’m sorry . I did n’t think about that . We ’re very relaxed around here . Technically , even I should call him Your Grace . ”
39908	39913	39902	39904	a total stranger	949	“ Seriously . Relax . ”
39947	39952	39953	39953	Ryder	75	“ This is us . ”
40013	40018	40019	40019	I	0	“ This is ridiculous , ”
40022	40026	40027	40027	Ryder	75	“ What is ? ”
40060	40066	40067	40067	I	0	“ What are we thinking ? ”
40174	40177	40178	40178	he	75	“ Here , ”
40189	40202	40178	40178	he	75	“ Water in this glass . Gin and tonic in this one . ”
40203	40211	40212	40212	I	0	“ Alcohol ? That ’s your solution ? ”
40215	40223	40212	40212	I	0	“ Is n’t it a bit early ? ”
40224	40249	40250	40250	I	0	“ British aristocracy are fond of their booze — you’ll hardly be judged for day - drinking — and you need to calm down . ”
40258	40290	40291	40291	I	0	“ You did n’t think to tell me you lived in a place like this , or that your grandfather is a duke . Is n’t that royalty , or something ? ”
40294	40304	40305	40305	he	75	“ No , Fairfax is n’t a royal dukedom , ”
40328	40337	40321	40321	he	75	“ Oh , well that ’s okay then . ”
40343	40355	40338	40338	I	0	“ I ’m not sure why I ’m making a fuss . ”
40359	40402	40356	40356	Ryder	75	“ I like sarcastic Scarlett . But seriously , this is n’t that big of a deal , just a little different to what you ’re used to . I grew up in it , so I just do n’t notice anymore . ”
40430	40457	40458	40458	He	75	“ We have work to do . I need some paper and pens and you have to take me through what I should be calling everyone . ”
40464	40485	40461	40461	he	75	“ I do n’t want to look like some crazy American who does n’t understand the world I ’m in . ”
40486	40500	40501	40501	He	75	“ Being American is the perfect excuse — people will forgive you anything . ”
40508	40537	40501	40501	He	75	“ You should n’t care what people think . My grandfather and my sister do n’t care about that stuff and they ’re the only people who matter . ”
40553	40591	40501	40501	He	75	“ Thank you . I would just feel better if I knew what was expected . I do n’t want to embarrass you or your family , Ryder . And I do n’t want to embarrass myself . ”
40592	40599	40600	40600	He	75	“ You would never . . . ”
40608	40643	40600	40600	He	75	“ I ’m sorry about dinner . I know you were n’t expecting Frederick on our first night home , but as my grandfather said , it was going to have to happen eventually . ”
40644	40653	40654	40654	I	0	“ I ’m so glad you ’re optimistic . ”
40663	40670	40654	40654	I	0	“ One of us should be . ”
40671	40676	40677	40677	I	0	“ Hand me that . ”
40691	40705	40677	40677	I	0	“ You have to brief me . We only have a few hours . ”
40706	40711	40712	40712	he	75	“ Whatever you need , ”
40748	40767	40787	40787	His	75	“ So , just to be clear , your grandfather , the duke , knows that we ’re — ”
40768	40786	40787	40787	His	75	“ Yes , he and Darcy know everything . I ’ve never lied to either of them . ”
40794	40825	40787	40787	His	75	“ My grandfather has always seen me as the rightful heir . It ’s not that he does n’t like Frederick — just that he was never meant to inherit . ”
40826	40836	40837	40837	Ryder	75	“ Okay , and I call him Your Grace ? ”
40840	40850	40837	40837	Ryder	75	“ Technically . But , that ’s not what — ”
40851	40858	40859	40859	Ryder	75	“ How would Aurora address him ? ”
40882	40891	40892	40892	he	75	“ She would probably just call him sir , ”
40895	40922	40892	40892	he	75	“ Okay , well I ’ll try to avoid saying anything but I ’ll call him sir if the occasion arises . How does that sound ? ”
40934	40941	40923	40923	He	75	“ You have totally got this . ”
40960	40976	40977	40977	I	0	“ I ’ll have to decide what to wear . Will you wear a suit ? ”
40998	41002	41003	41003	he	75	“ My tux , ”
41024	41032	41033	41033	He	75	“ Your tux ? You ’re kidding ? ”
41036	41049	41033	41033	He	75	“ It ’s no big deal . Do n’t worry about it . ”
41086	41095	41096	41096	he	75	“ Are you okay with sharing a room ? ”
41099	41116	41096	41096	he	75	“ I do think it looks better . My family knows I ’m not a saint . ”
41208	41226	41227	41227	I	0	“ I suppose since we ’re about to married , and moving in together anyway . . . ”
41290	41295	41296	41296	Ryder	75	“ You look beautiful , ”
41354	41365	41366	41366	I	0	“ Thanks . You do n’t look so bad yourself . ”
41388	41397	41398	41398	he	75	“ That blue looks fantastic with your hair , ”
41412	41423	41408	41408	I	0	“ Save your compliments for when we ’re in public . ”
41424	41436	41441	41441	his	75	“ I meant it , but okay . Are you ready ? ”
41448	41459	41460	41460	He	75	“ Sure . As ready as I ’ll ever be . ”
41474	41483	41484	41484	I	0	“ How far away is the dining room ? ”
41487	41496	41484	41484	I	0	“ These shoes are n’t meant for walking . ”
41500	41503	41504	41504	he	75	“ Piggyback ? ”
41510	41519	41507	41507	I	0	“ Be careful , I might say yes . ”
41563	41570	41571	41571	she	977	“ It ’s vile out there , ”
41581	41584	41585	41585	Ryder	75	“ Darce , ”
41615	41624	41625	41625	She	978	“ It ’s so good to see you . ”
41644	41648	41649	41649	he	75	“ Get off , ”
41661	41669	41670	41670	Ryder	75	“ Let me introduce you to Scarlett , ”
41680	41695	41670	41670	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett , this is my pain - in - my - backside sister . ”
41726	41772	41773	41773	She	978	“ It ’s beyond brilliant to have you here , Scarlett . Ryder ’s told me so much about you . Can you believe Frederick and Victoria insisted on coming over this evening ? Apologies in advance for the grilling you ’re going to get . ”
41787	41817	41818	41818	She	978	“ Well , we ’ll make sure you ’re okay . Just do n’t get left alone with Victoria . She might stab you with a fork or something . ”
41867	41875	41876	41876	Ryder	75	“ Darcy , where are your shoes ? ”
41924	41947	41948	41948	She	978	“ I went to check on the horses and lost them . So you ’ll have to deal with my stockinged feet . ”
41987	41990	41991	41991	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett , ”
41994	42010	41991	41991	Ryder	75	“ Let me introduce you to my cousin Frederick , and his wife , Victoria . ”
42011	42017	42018	42018	I	0	“ How do you do ? ”
42029	42035	42018	42018	I	0	“ How do you do ? ”
42096	42104	42105	42105	Darcy	69	“ Sit next to me , Scarlett , ”
42226	42233	42250	42250	her	71	“ So sorry I ’m late . ”
42265	42278	42279	42279	Victoria	71	“ So , Scarlett , tell me how you and Ryder met , ”
42282	42293	42279	42279	Victoria	71	“ It sounds like it ’s been a whirlwind romance . ”
42309	42347	42348	42348	He	75	“ Not for me . Scarlett does n’t remember , but we met at a party a couple of years ago . Her laugh caught my attention from across the room . And then I saw her . ”
42360	42377	42378	42378	Darcy	69	“ Of course I asked her out then , but alas she turned me down flat . ”
42411	42420	42421	42421	Frederick	72	“ It appears you won her over eventually , ”
42424	42430	42421	42421	Frederick	72	“ We met at work , ”
42460	42466	42467	42467	she	69	“ You work for Ryder ? ”
42499	42503	42504	42504	Ryder	75	“ I wish , ”
42507	42521	42504	42504	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett is a talented entrepreneur — I wanted to buy her business . ”
42522	42525	42526	42526	Frederick	72	“ Oh ? ”
42529	42535	42526	42526	Frederick	72	“ What business is that ? ”
42536	42557	42558	42558	I	0	“ It ’s a fragrance company based in New York . I set it up with a friend of mine , ”
42561	42582	42583	42583	Frederick	72	“ A fragrance company ? That does n’t sound like the type of investment you normally make , dear cousin , ”
42594	42618	42583	42583	Frederick	72	“ I like to invest in businesses that make money . Cecily Fragrance has great margins and a strong future ahead of it . ”
42663	42668	42669	42669	Darcy	69	“ Are you investing ? ”
42672	42698	42669	42669	Darcy	69	“ Well , I ’m not buying them out but the Westbury Group might provide them with some financing . Scarlett turned me down again . ”
42703	42710	42669	42669	Darcy	69	“ Good decision , my dear . ”
42711	42730	42699	42700	His grandfather	490	“ I wish I were joking , Grandfather , but Scarlett did n’t like my offer at all . ”
42731	42745	42746	42746	Victoria	71	“ Well , it seems you found an offer she liked well enough , ”
42759	42772	42773	42773	Ryder	75	“ I managed to convince her to join me for a drink , ”
42776	42789	42790	42790	Darcy	69	“ I ’m surprised your ego let you ask her out again , ”
42793	42805	42806	42806	Aurora	73	“ He ’s not used to women saying no to him , ”
42809	42818	42806	42806	Aurora	73	“ You were a challenge , I suppose . ”
42959	42963	42964	42964	Ryder	75	“ You okay ? ”
42990	43008	42975	42975	He	75	“ You ’re fitting right in . You had nothing to be concerned about . You see ? ”
43009	43013	43014	43014	I	0	“ A little , ”
43027	43037	43021	43021	He	75	“ You do look really beautiful tonight , Scarlett . ”
43038	43050	43051	43051	Victoria	71	“ We did n’t get a chance to see your ring , ”
43084	43094	43095	43095	she	71	“ Oh , it ’s new , is it ? ”
43111	43132	43095	43095	she	71	“ I thought Ryder may have given you his grandmother ’s . She left it to him , you know . ”
43133	43136	43137	43137	Ryder	75	“ Victoria , ”
43140	43149	43137	43137	Ryder	75	“ What ? It ’s a simple observation . ”
43183	43222	43223	43224	the duke	2349	“ I ’m sure such a young , pretty thing like Scarlett does n’t want an old - fashioned ring like the duchesses ’ canary diamond ring . Fashions change , is n’t that right , young lady ? ”
43255	43274	43275	43275	Ryder	75	“ I did n’t want her to feel obligated to accept an heirloom simply because she loves me , ”
43303	43314	43315	43315	Aurora	73	“ Are you planning to move back and live here ? ”
43325	43333	43315	43315	Aurora	73	“ You know , after the wedding . ”
43334	43348	43349	43349	Ryder	75	“ We ’ll spend time here , but our lives are in Manhattan , ”
43366	43378	43379	43379	Victoria	71	“ But you wo n’t come back to run the estate ? ”
43394	43410	43389	43389	Ryder	75	“ Things remain as they are — grandfather runs the estate and Darcy assists him . ”
43485	43495	43496	43496	Frederick	72	“ Are you going to Scotland for your honeymoon ? ”
43539	43584	43532	43532	Ryder	75	“ We ’re spending a week here and then flying back to Manhattan . There will be plenty of trips during the course of our marriage , but being here with the duke after his fall is what we both want to do now . ”
43630	43636	43637	43637	Frederick	72	“ Are we shooting tomorrow ? ”
43652	43666	43667	43667	Ryder	75	“ Let ’s see what the weather does — Merriman may need us , ”
43670	43686	43687	43687	Frederick	72	“ He wo n’t let us take the deer anymore , which is a shame , ”
43705	43715	43716	43716	Ryder	75	“ That ’s because you ’re a terrible shot , ”
43719	43726	43727	43728	the duke	2349	“ Now , now , boys , ”
43731	43750	43727	43728	the duke	2349	“ There ’s always plenty of pheasant . What will the girls do if the boys are shooting ? ”
43751	43760	43761	43761	Darcy	69	“ Maybe we ’ll go shooting , too , ”
43768	43795	43764	43765	The duke	2349	“ Oh yes , well , you are just as good a shot as anyone , Darcy . But Scarlett might not want to join in . ”
43796	43802	43803	43803	I	0	“ I do n’t mind , ”
43831	43849	43827	43827	Ryder	75	“ I ’ll probably have horrible jet lag anyway . I can catch up on my sleep . ”
43850	43857	43858	43858	Darcy	69	“ Did you bring your dress ? ”
43864	43877	43861	43861	I	0	“ Yes , I need to make sure it survived the journey . ”
43920	43928	43929	43929	she	83	“ I ca n’t wait to see , ”
43932	43967	43929	43929	she	83	“ Maybe you can show me and then we can go get pampered . Do pre - wedding body prep . There ’s a hotel with a great spa about ten miles from here . ”
43968	43974	43975	43975	Aurora	73	“ I love it there , ”
43978	43992	43993	43993	Victoria	71	“ We should all go . We can get to know you better , ”
43996	44005	44006	44006	Ryder	75	“ Let ’s just see , shall we ? ”
44009	44021	44006	44006	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett and I both have jobs to check in on . ”
44163	44170	44171	44171	he	75	“ You did really well tonight , ”
44197	44211	44212	44212	I	0	“ It was a lot to take in . Thank God for you , ”
44227	44236	44212	44212	I	0	“ I think Victoria was out for blood . ”
44249	44258	44259	44259	I	0	“ Yeah , she ’s clearly not happy . ”
44262	44285	44259	44259	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe she said that thing about who was going to run the estate . It was so disrespectful . ”
44286	44323	44326	44326	he	1027	“ That ’s what she ’s like . Her eye has always been on the prize — Woolton — then you waltz in ready to take that away from her , and looking like you do . ”
44329	44337	44338	44338	he	1027	“ You ’re very beautiful , Scarlett , ”
44384	44399	44400	44400	His	1027	“ I ’m glad I passed their inspection . So far , at least . ”
44479	44513	44477	44477	him	75	“ I do n’t have to go shooting tomorrow . God knows , I could do without a day with Frederick . I do n’t see why you should be subjected to Victoria . ”
44514	44519	44477	44477	him	75	“ It ’s fine . ”
44578	44589	44590	44590	he	75	“ This is nice . Being here , with you , ”
44662	44672	44657	44657	He	75	“ I know we said no sex . . . ”
44681	44687	44673	44673	I	0	“ We really should n’t . ”
44713	44722	44723	44723	I	0	“ It ’s just you ’re so beautiful . ”
44774	44781	44782	44782	he	75	“ And it was so good , ”
44796	44801	44802	44802	he	75	“ Was n’t it ? ”
44810	44816	44802	44802	he	75	“ So , so good . ”
44985	44993	44981	44981	He	75	“ God , I like kissing you . ”
45010	45017	45007	45007	I	0	“ I like kissing you too . ”
45018	45022	45023	45023	he	75	“ And this ? ”
45033	45041	45023	45023	he	75	“ I like all this , too . ”
45118	45127	45128	45128	He	75	“ Now , I like that even more . ”
45203	45213	45214	45214	he	75	“ You ’re going to have to be quiet , ”
45223	45239	45240	45240	He	75	“ These walls are thick , but they ’re not going to withstand a scream . ”
45327	45335	45336	45336	he	75	“ You promise you ’ll be quiet ? ”
45351	45354	45343	45343	he	75	“ Yes . ”
45375	45380	45357	45357	my	0	“ Do n’t stop . ”
45381	45387	45388	45388	he	75	“ Relax and trust me , ”
45804	45809	45810	45810	she	89	“ You look angry , ”
45813	45820	45810	45810	she	89	“ What ’s on your mind ? ”
45858	45870	45838	45838	her	89	“ You want to ask me what I ’m not thinking . ”
45871	45874	45875	45875	She	89	“ What ? ”
45888	45891	45892	45892	I	0	“ No , ”
45907	45920	45895	45895	She	89	“ Sorry , I ’m going to come if you touch me . ”
45958	45962	45963	45963	she	89	“ You are ? ”
46051	46061	46062	46062	she	89	“ You want me to help you with that ? ”
46094	46109	46088	46088	she	89	“ If you do n’t behave , I ’ll bend you over my knee . ”
46186	46192	46193	46193	I	0	“ Like what you see ? ”
46240	46259	46233	46233	I	0	“ Well , I know what it can do , so yeah , I like what I see . ”
46299	46306	46307	46307	I	0	“ Come show me how much , ”
46310	46314	46307	46307	I	0	“ Straddle me . ”
46384	46389	46390	46390	she	89	“ You ’re bossy , ”
46405	46410	46411	46411	I	0	“ You like it , ”
46556	46562	46563	46563	I	0	“ I want inside you , ”

46923	46929	46930	46930	She	89	“ It ’s too much . ”
46986	46989	46990	46990	she	89	“ Yes , ”
46993	46996	46990	46990	she	89	“ More . ”
47016	47023	47024	47024	I	0	“ I ’ll give you more , ”
47074	47083	47084	47084	I	0	“ I ’m going to give you everything . ”
47174	47188	47163	47163	my	0	“ Like that ? Like it when I fuck you good and hard ? ”
47247	47255	47256	47256	she	89	“ I like how you like it , ”

47594	47610	47586	47586	she	89	“ I hope no one heard . I tried , Ryder . I really tried . ”
47623	47642	47611	47611	I	0	“ Hey , do n’t worry about it . I do n’t think I exactly held back either . ”

47652	47658	47649	47649	she	89	“ It ’s so disrespectful . ”

47673	47691	47666	47666	I	0	“ He ’s on the other side of the house . He definitely wo n’t have heard . ”
47692	47696	47649	47649	she	89	“ You think ? ”
47697	47700	47701	47701	I	0	“ Absolutely . ”
47724	47734	47701	47701	I	0	“ You wanna test my theory and go again ? ”
47865	47872	47873	47873	he	126	“ Let ’s go from here , ”
47997	48008	48009	48009	Frederick	72	“ I doubt you do much shooting in New York , ”
48012	48021	48022	48022	he	72	“ You a little worried about being rusty ? ”
48046	48066	48076	48076	he	126	“ Not that worried , no . No doubt Merriman will be better than both of us as usual . ”
48170	48178	48179	48179	I	0	“ You should have worn walking shoes , ”
48235	48255	48256	48256	I	0	“ Rubbish . Just because you live in America does n’t mean I have to let my standards slip . ”
48476	48487	48470	48470	he	126	“ You still think you ’re going to beat me ? ”
48488	48521	48522	48522	I	0	“ What can I say ? If it happens , it ’s because my beautiful fiancée kept me awake and , rest assured , it will not bother me in the least . ”
48539	48557	48558	48558	he	126	“ Yeah , right . What an excuse . As if you two are actually sleeping together , ”
48581	48593	48571	48571	I	0	“ You think we ’re saving it until our wedding night ? ”
48594	48638	48571	48571	I	0	“ I doubt she ’ll go through with it . If she ’s got any sense , she ’ll take the money you ’ve obviously paid her and walk away . Unless , of course , you ’re paying extra for the sex . ”
48705	48716	48691	48691	she	89	“ Or maybe she just wants to be a duchess . ”
48717	48729	48691	48691	she	89	“ She did n’t know about the title when I proposed . ”
48765	48796	48759	48759	she	89	“ Yes , all very convenient . She ’s the perfect woman , who suddenly has you popping the question , and just in the nick of time , too . ”
48797	48804	48691	48691	she	89	“ What exactly are you implying ? ”
48805	48848	48759	48759	she	89	“ I ’m not implying anything . I think I ’m saying it quite openly . There ’s no way your romance , or whatever you want to call it , with that woman is real . You just want to inherit . ”
48849	48888	48691	48691	she	89	“ You ’re a dick , Frederick . If what you were saying is true , why on earth would n’t I have married before now ? Why did n’t I simply marry when Grandfather had his stroke ? ”
48902	48912	48913	48913	He	1087	“ Or at any time in the last decade ? ”
48938	48946	48947	48947	He	1087	“ I ’m not quite sure yet . ”
48967	48987	48960	48960	he	1087	“ But these things tend to have a habit of revealing themselves as I ’m sure that woman will . ”
49021	49049	49008	49008	he	1087	“ That woman ? My fiancée ’s name is Scarlett . You might not like it , Frederick , but Scarlett is going to be my wife . ”
49050	49064	49139	49139	him	1090	“ Your whole relationship is a fake , and we both know it . ”
49065	49116	49117	49117	I	0	“ Because it ’s not convenient to you ? You should have been a fly on the wall in our bedroom last night — no one was faking anything . You might have a sexless marriage , but I certainly wo n’t . Hell , take one look at Scarlett . ”
49120	49131	49117	49117	I	0	“ As if I can keep my hands off her . ”
49164	49172	49161	49161	his	72	“ Victoria is a very attractive woman . ”
49173	49188	49189	49189	My	0	“ Yeah ? I reckon you have n’t had head since you married her . ”
49216	49219	49220	49220	Merriman	126	“ Gentleman , ”
49223	49233	49220	49220	Merriman	126	“ Can we concentrate on the matter at hand ? ”
49240	49243	49238	49238	Merriman	126	“ Sorry . ”
49320	49327	49328	49328	I	0	“ You have my full attention , ”
49481	49488	49489	49489	Darcy	69	“ Do n’t worry about them , ”
49564	49574	49554	49554	She	69	“ I ’m not . I ’m just relaxing . ”
49598	49644	49645	49645	I	0	“ I bet Ryder told you the story regarding Aurora , but probably left out all the details that matter . She ’s been after him since she got her braces taken out . She ’s been a total mess since he announced your engagement . ”
49655	49663	49645	49645	I	0	“ Ryder said they were never together . ”
49678	49700	49666	49666	her	69	“ No , they never dated . I think when he was about fifteen they kissed , but that was it . ”
49731	49755	49756	49756	Darcy	69	“ Ryder has always been very clear that he ’d never marry . He used to joke that George Clooney stole his idea , ”
49759	49769	49756	49756	Darcy	69	“ But she thought he ’d change his mind ? ”
49770	49793	49853	49853	her	69	“ I guess . But Ryder never even had girlfriends . There was nothing to suggest he was going to settle down . ”
49794	49819	49853	49853	her	69	“ Unless she thought he was playing the field and one day he ’d come back , make a life and children with her . ”
49820	49846	49847	49847	Darcy	69	“ If that ’s what she thought then she ’s delusional . Ryder is as ruthless with his women as he is in business dealings , ”
49858	49870	49871	49871	She	69	“ Though I ’ve never known him to deliberately upset someone . ”
49886	49901	49902	49902	Darcy	69	“ I told him to marry Aurora . I knew she ’d be willing . ”
49905	49938	49902	49902	Darcy	69	“ But Ryder would n’t agree to it , said it would hurt Aurora that he could never be a real husband . So I do n’t think he led her on . ”
49939	49951	49952	49952	Darcy	69	“ Did she know he ’d only inherit if he married ? ”
49960	49978	49979	49979	She	69	“ Everyone knows that , though I do n’t think it was the money she was after . ”
49984	50017	49979	49979	She	69	“ Well not entirely , anyway . I think she liked the idea of the whole package — the title , the social status . But mostly I think she loves him . ”
50018	50025	49979	49979	She	69	“ And you two are friends ? ”
50049	50077	50078	50078	She	69	“ Yes , we ’ve always been friends . Though my feelings are not so warm where Victoria is concerned . The woman does n’t have friends . ”
50081	50092	50078	50078	She	69	“ That sounds bitchy , but I ’m being factual . ”
50093	50101	50102	50102	I	0	“ But Aurora and Victoria look close , ”
50111	50172	50102	50102	I	0	“ They ’re not close . Victoria ’s probably pumping her for information about you . But Aurora does n’t know anything . She might suspect ulterior motives — she knows how Ryder is , after all — but you and he were so cute at dinner last night . More than anything else , I imagine she ’s jealous . ”
50173	50181	50182	50182	Victoria	71	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
50194	50198	50199	50199	Darcy	69	“ My brother , ”
50202	50214	50199	50199	Darcy	69	“ I was just telling Scarlett how cute they look together . ”
50228	50237	50238	50238	Aurora	73	“ How did you say you met again ? ”
50259	50288	50289	50289	Aurora	73	“ As I said last night , I do n’t remember the first time we met . It was at a party a couple of years ago apparently . ”
50313	50320	50321	50321	Victoria	71	“ You have amnesia or something ? ”
50324	50336	50321	50321	Victoria	71	“ No . He asked me out and I said no . ”
50337	50345	50346	50346	she	73	“ I thought you did n’t remember , ”
50354	50399	50349	50349	I	0	“ I do n’t , but Ryder ’s told me the story more than once . Of course , he could be totally making it up . But then , I was married . I would n’t have been paying attention to other men . ”
50400	50403	50404	50404	Aurora	73	“ Married ? ”
50407	50414	50404	50404	Aurora	73	“ And you ’re divorced now ? ”
50415	50428	50429	50429	Darcy	69	“ Well she ’s not about to commit bigamy , is she ? ”
50432	50446	50429	50429	Darcy	69	“ The wedding is the day after tomorrow , for goodness ’ sake . ”
50450	50458	50447	50447	I	0	“ Yes , we ’re divorced now . ”
50489	50502	50503	50503	I	0	“ My ex and I grew up together , were childhood sweethearts . ”
50520	50539	50508	50508	I	0	“ We started dating at fifteen . Got married at twenty - one . We were too young . ”
50667	50673	50674	50674	Victoria	71	“ And it ’s amicable ? ”
50677	50685	50674	50674	Victoria	71	“ Or was it a bad breakup ? ”
50686	50689	50690	50690	Darcy	69	“ Victoria , ”
50699	50719	50690	50690	Darcy	69	“ It ’s as amicable as these things can be . Definitely better now that some time has passed . ”
50726	50737	50738	50738	Victoria	71	“ And you looked Ryder up when you got divorced ? ”
50755	50758	50741	50741	I	0	“ Nope . ”
50772	50812	50764	50764	Victoria	71	“ I could n’t , as I said last night . I did n’t even remember meeting him . We ran into each other at work . Well , he wanted to purchase the business I co - founded . ”
50813	50830	50741	50741	I	0	“ Oh right , so it ’s buy the business , get the girl for free ? ”
50831	50834	50835	50835	Darcy	69	“ Victoria , ”
50842	50859	50837	50837	Aurora	73	“ My business partner and I refused his offer , but I agreed to a date . ”
50860	50866	50867	50867	Aurora	73	“ That ’s so cute , ”
50870	50902	50867	50867	Aurora	73	“ I have to say it was a bit of a shock . Ryder ’s always liked women , so I was surprised to hear he ’d decided to settle down . ”
50903	50915	50916	50916	Victoria	71	“ Just say what you mean — Ryder ’s a slut , ”
50919	50941	50916	50916	Victoria	71	“ He ’s fucked most of New York from what I understand . I hope you know what you ’re doing . ”
50942	50959	50867	50867	Aurora	73	“ That ’s my brother you ’re speaking of , Victoria . If you say another — ”
50960	50975	50976	50976	I	0	“ Well , I have to say , he ’s certainly honed his craft , ”
50991	51004	51005	51005	she	69	“ Yes , you sounded like you were having fun last night , ”
51023	51029	51030	51030	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
51058	51071	51052	51052	I	0	“ I just mean I have no reason to doubt his loyalty . ”
51111	51116	51117	51117	Darcy	69	“ Oh my God , ”
51120	51141	51117	51117	Darcy	69	“ That was perfect . You even managed to blush when I pretended I ’d overheard the two of you . ”
51142	51148	51150	51150	God	118	“ You made that up ? ”
51221	51234	51235	51235	She	69	“ Well , I thought I ’d made it up . . . ”
51242	51252	51237	51237	her	69	“ Were you and Ryder . . . together ? ”
51266	51276	51277	51277	I	0	“ He must have told you how we met , ”
51280	51284	51277	51277	I	0	“ Remind me . ”
51340	51358	51333	51333	Ryder	75	“ So it ’s not as if we first slept together after . . . you know . ”
51359	51363	51364	51364	Darcy	69	“ He proposed . ”
51371	51374	51364	51364	Darcy	69	“ Exactly . ”
51375	51383	51384	51384	she	69	“ But you ’re still sleeping together ? ”
51387	51392	51384	51384	she	69	“ Just last night . ”
51424	51439	51440	51440	she	69	“ Twice is double the number of times he normally sleeps with a woman , ”
51545	51548	51549	51549	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett ! ”
51555	51561	51562	51562	I	0	“ I ’m in here , ”
51602	51605	51606	51606	he	75	“ Shit , ”
51620	51623	51615	51615	He	75	“ Sorry . ”
51624	51632	51633	51633	I	0	“ Do n’t be . Come in . ”
51671	51678	51662	51662	He	75	“ Are you sure ? I — ”
51679	51693	51662	51662	He	75	“ Come in and shut the door — you’re letting the cold in . ”
51747	51757	51758	51758	he	75	“ You do n’t mind me being in here ? ”
51769	51773	51774	51774	He	75	“ Should I ? ”
51802	51816	51799	51799	He	75	“ I do n’t know . I thought you might want your privacy . ”
51829	51855	51824	51824	he	75	“ I ’m fine and you ’re a sight for sore eyes . I want to hear about your day . So why not now ? ”
51859	51867	51856	51856	I	0	“ How many birds did you kill ? ”
51868	51884	51901	51901	his	75	“ A sight for sore eyes ? Does that mean the spa day was difficult ? ”
51885	51892	51893	51893	I	0	“ Tell me about the birds , ”
51904	51925	51926	51926	I	0	“ I ’ll tell you about the birds and Fred - a - dick when you tell me about Victoria . ”
51929	51948	51949	51949	I	0	“ You know you sound like a fifteen - year - old boy when you call him that , ”
51952	51966	51949	51949	I	0	“ What can I say ? He brings out the worst in me . ”
51978	51981	51982	51982	he	75	“ Nice , ”
51985	52000	51982	51982	he	75	“ You can join me if you want . Plenty of room for two . ”
52028	52038	52019	52019	He	75	“ And then you ’ll tell me about Victoria ? ”
52039	52056	52057	52057	I	0	“ I ’m not suggesting Chinese water torture . It ’s a bath , not blackmail . ”
52062	52075	52057	52057	I	0	“ And anyway , Victoria was n’t anything I could n’t handle . ”
52084	52092	52076	52076	He	75	“ A bath actually does sound great . ”
52181	52188	52189	52189	I	0	“ You have a great ass , ”
52195	52200	52192	52192	He	75	“ Back at you . ”
52207	52221	52201	52201	He	75	“ Sit between my legs and I ’ll give your back a rub . ”
52222	52232	52233	52233	he	75	“ My favorite place to be , Miss King , ”
52274	52279	52280	52280	he	75	“ It ’s cold , ”
52293	52309	52290	52290	I	0	“ Do n’t be a baby . I ’m going to make you feel great . ”
52361	52366	52367	52367	he	75	“ It feels good , ”
52370	52377	52367	52367	he	75	“ I told you it would . ”
52393	52403	52404	52404	I	0	“ Fred - a - dick got you tense , ”
52407	52417	52418	52418	he	75	“ Apparently , you ’re the cure for that , ”
52421	52427	52428	52428	I	0	“ Wanna talk about it ? ”
52440	52455	52431	52431	He	75	“ Nope . I ca n’t even remember why he pissed me off now . ”
52456	52461	52462	52462	I	0	“ Families are complicated , ”
52465	52520	52462	52462	I	0	“ Yeah , you can say that again . I ’m lucky really . I have my grandfather and Darcy — a lot of people do n’t even have that . They ’ve never let me down . I can count on them for anything . And I would walk through fire for them . ”
52526	52541	52542	52542	I	0	“ You do n’t wish you had more of a relationship with your parents ? ”
52556	52564	52545	52545	He	1129	“ My grandparents were my parents really . ”
52582	52590	52576	52576	he	1129	“ You do n’t miss your mom ? ”
52600	52623	52591	52591	He	1129	“ An idea of her perhaps . But I ca n’t miss someone who I never knew , who was never around . ”
52624	52628	52629	52629	I	0	“ I suppose . ”
52639	52679	52629	52629	I	0	“ I would n’t wish the parents I had on anyone and I would n’t want to be the people they are . But at the same time , I ca n’t complain about the privileged life I have . ”
52680	52695	52696	52696	He	1129	“ I ’m not sure any privilege makes up for not having a mom . ”
52711	52717	52718	52718	I	0	“ Will I meet her ? ”
52726	52738	52721	52721	Ryder	75	“ I have no idea where she is at the moment . ”
52744	52755	52741	52741	his	1129	“ Have n’t seen her for a couple of years . ”
52779	52784	52785	52785	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
52788	52828	52785	52785	I	0	“ Do n’t be . Not now . When we were kids it was . . . more difficult . But now ? Like I said , I have my grandfather and Darcy . That ’s all I need . ”
52968	52976	52977	52977	he	1129	“ You have suds on your head , ”
52980	52984	52977	52977	he	1129	“ I do ? ”
52993	53013	53014	53014	He	1129	“ They suited you . But you could wear naked with anything and you ’d make it look great . ”
53017	53027	53014	53014	He	1129	“ God , am I being a cheeseball again ? ”
53038	53041	53042	53042	I	0	“ Again ? ”
53045	53057	53058	53058	he	1129	“ You called me a cheeseball the first night we met , ”
53068	53072	53058	53058	he	1129	“ I did ? ”
53080	53097	53098	53098	I	0	“ Yeah , it threw me off my game a little . You do n’t remember ? ”
53120	53123	53124	53124	I	0	“ Nope . ”
53159	53176	53178	53178	his	1129	“ I do n’t remember you being a cheeseball . Are you giving me fake compliments ? ”
53219	53226	53227	53227	He	1129	“ Or did you mean it ? ”
53232	53252	53227	53227	He	1129	“ Yeah , I meant it . You ’re beautiful . Unselfconscious and open , which is really attractive . ”
53267	53274	53253	53253	He	1129	“ I find it very sexy . ”
53343	53351	53352	53352	he	1129	“ Your turn for a foot rub , ”
53383	53388	53389	53389	he	1129	“ This is nice , ”
53392	53399	53389	53389	he	1129	“ I ’ve never . . . ”
53451	53460	53446	53446	him	1129	“ The sounds that you make . . . ”
53473	53478	53479	53479	I	0	“ I like them . ”
53482	53489	53479	53479	I	0	“ They make me . . . ”
53526	53536	53510	53510	I	0	“ Giving me a foot rub gets you hard ? ”
53537	53548	53549	53549	he	1129	“ The noises that come out of your mouth do , ”
53559	53569	53549	53549	he	1129	“ I do n’t mean to be so loud . ”
53625	53633	53634	53634	He	1129	“ I like every noise you make . ”
53721	53725	53714	53714	his	1129	“ Clean enough ? ”
53746	53756	53726	53726	I	0	“ Because I want to get a little dirty . ”
53788	53794	53795	53795	I	0	“ Fucking croquet ? Really ? ”
53870	53888	53863	53863	She	89	“ Do n’t be so miserable . It ’s a beautiful day and I ’ve never played . ”
53889	53898	53899	53899	Frederick	72	“ I ’d prefer to play with you . ”
53971	53980	53981	53981	Scarlett	89	“ You are going to play with me , ”
53987	54004	53984	53984	I	0	“ Not like that . I mean naked . I want to play with you naked . ”
54220	54245	54246	54246	she	89	“ You ’ve played with me naked enough . We have to go out into the world and interact with people with clothes on , ”
54269	54276	54277	54277	I	0	“ You ’re such a spoilsport , ”
54444	54447	54448	54448	Scarlett	89	“ Ryder , ”
54477	54483	54470	54470	I	0	“ You ’ve met Violet . ”
54484	54495	54496	54496	I	0	“ Thank you so much for coming all this way , ”
54505	54521	54522	54522	Violet	82	“ As if I was going to turn down a chance to come to England , ”
54541	54551	54525	54525	She	82	“ And my sister ’s wedding , of course . ”
54552	54567	54525	54525	She	82	“ And this is my brother , Max , and Harper , his wife . ”
54778	54786	54787	54787	I	0	“ Are we pretending it ’s summer ? ”
54797	54812	54813	54813	he	1188	“ I thought it would be a taste of England for our American friends , ”
54816	54835	54836	54836	I	0	“ The way you make it , Lane , we ’ll all be passed out by tea time , ”
54852	54859	54860	54860	I	0	“ Exactly my plan , sir . ”
54868	54873	54860	54860	I	0	“ What is this ? ”
54883	54892	54874	54874	Scarlett	89	“ And why is it garnished with salad ? ”
54893	54917	54918	54918	I	0	“ Pimms , and it ’s not like it comes with a salad bowl . It ’s just cucumber . And some fruit . ”
54935	54939	54940	54940	She	89	“ Try it . ”
54956	54965	54966	54967	a woman	231	“ Look at you , so cute together , ”
54980	54992	54966	54967	a woman	231	“ It ’s as if you ’re made for each other . ”
55035	55081	55028	55028	she	89	“ Awww , thank you , Victoria . That ’s what Ryder keeps saying — that we ’re made for each other . I keep asking him where he left his stiff upper lip , but of course I love it when he says it . ”
55090	55098	55099	55099	she	89	“ That dress is fabulous on you , ”
55109	55118	55099	55099	she	89	“ It really shows off your body fantastically . ”
55146	55150	55151	55151	she	89	“ Thank you , ”
55154	55174	55175	55175	Scarlett	89	“ You are so welcome . I ’m sure you get a million compliments a day about your figure , ”
55220	55226	55227	55227	Darcy	69	“ I have the teams , ”
55237	55242	55227	55227	Darcy	69	“ Gather ’ round . ”
55243	55251	55252	55252	Scarlett	89	“ You ’re going to teach me ? ”
55261	55264	55265	55265	I	0	“ Sure , ”
55332	55337	55338	55338	Darcy	69	“ Your usual colors ? ”
55344	55351	55352	55352	I	0	“ You want red or yellow ? ”
55362	55370	55371	55371	she	89	“ You mean you ca n’t guess ? ”
55374	55386	55387	55387	I	0	“ I would have thought my name would give it away . ”
55390	55405	55387	55387	I	0	“ Of course , Miss King . I ’ll take yellow . You toss . ”
55419	55426	55427	55427	Scarlett	89	“ Who are we playing against ? ”
55439	55446	55447	55447	I	0	“ Hopefully not Frederick and Victoria , ”
55458	55471	55447	55447	I	0	“ Oh , I do n’t know , that could be fun . ”
55472	55477	55478	55478	I	0	“ You ’re crazy . ”
55490	55503	55478	55478	I	0	“ Victoria does n’t know what to make of you at all . ”
55504	55518	55519	55519	She	89	“ Oh , do n’t tell me you do n’t enjoy my teasing . ”
55527	55535	55519	55519	She	89	“ I know you better than that . ”
55547	55558	55559	55559	She	89	“ You certainly seem to know what you ’re doing . ”
55564	55571	55572	55572	I	0	“ With Victoria , I mean , ”
55575	55583	55584	55584	she	89	“ And I ’m great in bed , ”
55599	55608	55609	55609	Frederick	72	“ Looks like it ’s cousin against cousin , ”
55674	55691	55692	55692	Ryder	75	“ Grip the shaft at the top with both hands , your right below your left , ”
55703	55711	55692	55692	Ryder	75	“ Make sure you ’re clenched tight . ”
55750	55754	55743	55743	Victoria	71	“ Like this ? ”
55760	55764	55755	55755	I	0	“ Or tighter ? ”
55788	55794	55795	55795	he	75	“ Your arse looks fantastic , ”
55839	55857	55858	55858	Ryder	75	“ How many times are you going to say the word shaft to me during this match ? ”
55914	55925	55926	55926	I	0	“ That ’s right . Now , take the shot . ”
55939	55945	55946	55946	he	75	“ That ’s my girl , ”
56127	56133	56134	56134	I	0	“ Good shot , sexy , ”
56209	56216	56197	56197	He	75	“ Was it a good shot ? ”
56237	56247	56248	56248	I	0	“ Of course it was . I made it . ”
56253	56264	56248	56248	I	0	“ Modesty is n’t your strong suit , is it ? ”
56265	56279	56280	56280	He	75	“ Not false modesty . I ’m very un - British like that . ”
56288	56302	56280	56280	He	75	“ Tell me one thing you do n’t think you ’re good at ? ”
56324	56327	56313	56313	He	75	“ Plenty . ”
56328	56332	56333	56333	I	0	“ Tell me , ”
56358	56374	56333	56333	I	0	“ I can make you a list of all my faults , if you like . ”
56375	56390	56407	56407	His	75	“ Ahhh , I see . You ca n’t admit when you ’re wrong . ”
56391	56406	56407	56407	His	75	“ Maybe I do n’t want to admit that I have faults to you . ”
56538	56545	56546	56546	he	75	“ I ’m bad with women , ”
56628	56632	56633	56633	I	0	“ No lying , ”
56636	56639	56633	56633	I	0	“ Lying ? ”
56640	56668	56626	56626	him	75	“ Do n’t give me some bullshit that you ’re bad with women . I should n’t have asked . I was having fun and . . . ”
56682	56688	56697	56697	Ryder	75	“ Just forget I asked . ”
56706	56720	56697	56697	Ryder	75	“ I have no idea what ’s happening . Why are you angry ? ”
56721	56727	56728	56728	I	0	“ It ’s your turn , ”
56745	56749	56750	56750	I	0	“ Your shot , ”
56753	56760	56750	56750	I	0	“ Oh , right , yes . ”
56789	56802	56761	56761	He	75	“ You did n’t answer my question . Why are you angry ? ”
56829	56835	56836	56836	I	0	“ I ’m not mad . ”
56849	56860	56843	56843	I	0	“ I just do n’t appreciate you lying to me . ”
56861	56873	56886	56886	he	75	“ I was n’t lying . I am bad with women . ”
56874	56877	56878	56878	I	0	“ Right , ”
56902	56918	56919	56919	He	75	“ I ’m not talking about sex . Obviously , I can seduce a woman . ”
56958	57008	57009	57009	Frederick	72	“ I mean relationships . I ’ve never spent time with a woman who was n’t Darcy or . . . I do n’t know what I ’m saying , really . I just do n’t have a track record for hanging out with women . But with you — ”
57079	57089	57074	57074	he	75	“ Relax and hit a long , smooth stroke . ”
57090	57093	57094	57094	I	0	“ Ryder , ”
57125	57136	57102	57102	he	75	“ I ’m not letting go . Take the shot . ”
57137	57156	57102	57102	he	75	“ If you do n’t move , I ’m not going to be able to make this shot . ”
57157	57175	57102	57102	he	75	“ I do n’t give a shit . Take the shot . I ’m not letting go . ”
57243	57277	57278	57278	He	75	“ Look . I ’m having a lot of fun hanging out with you . Just being with you , and it ’s made me realize that I ’ve never had that before . ”
57286	57302	57304	57304	he	75	“ I ’ve never spent time with a woman just because I liked her company . ”
57315	57373	57374	57374	He	75	“ Of course I ’ve spent time with women ; it ’s a prerequisite to getting laid . I ’ve just never done so fully clothed , or just because I enjoy their company . All I ’m trying to say is that I like sleeping with you , but I like just hanging out , too . ”
57377	57398	57374	57374	He	75	“ Maybe if I ’d realized it could be this good , I would have given it a shot sooner . ”
57414	57421	57422	57422	he	75	“ Have I pissed you off ? ”
57425	57429	57422	57422	he	75	“ Your shot , ”
57440	57460	57430	57430	Frederick	72	“ Christ , the guy ’s a prick . Ca n’t he see that we ’re having a conversation ? ”
57477	57481	57482	57482	I	0	“ Kiss me , ”
57485	57489	57482	57482	I	0	“ Kiss you ? ”
57500	57507	57490	57490	I	0	“ I have to ask twice ? ”
57695	57708	57709	57709	Ryder	75	“ Go and get this old duke something to wet my palate , ”
57746	57752	57736	57736	Ryder	75	“ Of course . Scarlett — ”
57753	57774	57775	57776	the duke	2349	“ You can be without her for just a few minutes , Ryder . I ’ll take care of her , ”
57817	57825	57826	57826	I	0	“ This has been a lovely afternoon , ”
57838	57859	57831	57831	Ryder	75	“ Made all the better for your presence . I ’ve never seen Ryder quite so at ease with himself . ”
57860	57870	57826	57826	I	0	“ I guess our arrangement takes the pressure off . ”
57871	57875	57826	57826	I	0	“ How so ? ”
57876	57919	57831	57831	Ryder	75	“ You know , because it does n’t matter if his friends or family like me . Or if I do or say the wrong thing . It matters to me , of course . But Ryder does n’t have to worry . ”
57920	57970	57971	57971	I	0	“ I ’m not sure that would ever be a concern for Ryder . That young man has got a mighty will . No one can make him do anything he does n’t want to do . Or force him to have an opinion that is n’t his own . ”
57978	57982	57983	57983	I	0	“ I guess . ”
58035	58047	58048	58049	the duke	2349	“ Did I ever tell you how I met my wife ? ”
58057	58065	58066	58066	I	0	“ I do n’t think you did , ”
58069	58119	58126	58126	he	2349	“ I was twenty - five . And the last thing I wanted to do was settle down . It was the sixties and I took full advantage of the free love , though in the end , I still had my responsibilities to the estate and my father . ”
58129	58162	58126	58126	he	2349	“ My mother picked my wife for me . She was very suitable . Came from a good family . Bred to understand her duties and responsibilities to the estate very well . ”
58172	58175	58176	58176	I	0	“ Duties ? ”
58179	58247	58176	58176	I	0	“ The Woolton Estate , being Duchess of Fairfax — it ’s all a big responsibility . It takes a lot of work . And my mother understood that . Of course , I tried to resist the union for as long as possible . I refused to meet my wife for months . But eventually , my parents invited her to our annual summer garden party . ”
58264	58300	58261	58261	his	2349	“ I did n’t think she was suited to me in the slightest and I hated my parents for forcing this stranger onto me . I thought she was meek , and far too serious . ”
58301	58322	58356	58356	He	2349	“ I had no idea . I ’m sorry that you were forced to marry someone you did n’t love . ”
58363	58379	58356	58356	He	2349	“ Do n’t be . Marrying the duchess was the best thing I ever did . ”
58386	58411	58412	58412	He	2349	“ Sometimes , the most unusual circumstances can throw two people together — that does n’t mean they ’re not perfect for each other . ”
58415	58480	58412	58412	He	2349	“ It took me a while to realize what I had , to understand her strength and vulnerability , her character and her beauty . And when I realized who she was and recognized I ’d fallen in love , I kicked myself for not valuing her more highly , more quickly . From that moment on , she was a treasure to me . ”
58481	58488	58489	58489	Ryder	75	“ Here you are , Grandfather , ”
58502	58510	58511	58511	he	2349	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
58585	58603	58565	58565	he	2349	“ I ’m just telling Scarlett here about your grandmother , and how much I adored her . ”
58604	58612	58613	58613	Ryder	75	“ You treated her like a queen , ”
58616	58634	58635	58636	The duke	2349	“ Because that ’s what she deserved . And she treated me like a king in return . ”
58639	58654	58655	58655	Ryder	75	“ You were made for each other . Two sides of the same coin , ”
58658	58663	58664	58665	the duke	2349	“ You ’re right , ”
58668	58674	58664	58665	the duke	2349	“ We grew to be . ”
58675	58700	58701	58701	He	2349	“ You used to tell Darcy and me about how you met at the summer ball and how you swept her off her feet . ”
58704	58729	58730	58730	Ryder	75	“ She liked me to tell that story . Said she loved the romance of it , even if most of it was exaggerated . ”
58733	58741	58730	58730	Ryder	75	“ She was a very special woman . ”
58750	58774	58742	58743	The duke	2349	“ We Westbury men have a habit of finding the right woman — even if we do n’t realize it at the time . ”
58777	58783	58784	58784	Darcy	69	“ You look . . . ”
58809	58812	58813	58813	I	0	“ Handsome ? ”
58821	58826	58816	58816	She	69	“ Like the groom . ”
58827	58832	58833	58833	I	0	“ Thanks , Darce . ”
58862	58879	58880	58880	I	0	“ It ’s a good bloody job since I am the groom . Is Scarlett ready ? ”
58893	58918	58880	58880	I	0	“ Last time I saw her she , Violet and Harper were trying to figure out how drunk was too drunk for a bride . ”
58919	58922	58923	58923	She	195	“ Jesus . ”
58941	58950	58951	58951	I	0	“ You think she ’s having second thoughts ? ”
58965	58976	58958	58958	she	69	“ I think she ’s messing about with her girlfriends . ”
58999	59015	58980	58980	she	69	“ Do you think I should be forcing her to go through with this wedding ? ”
59016	59020	59021	59021	Darcy	69	“ Forcing her ? ”
59043	59060	59021	59021	Darcy	69	“ You ’re not forcing her to do anything . You ’re paying her , remember ? ”
59124	59136	59137	59137	Darcy	69	“ You ’re both getting what you need out of this , ”
59150	59169	59170	59170	I	0	“ I feel like I ’m taking more than I ’m giving . I ’m a selfish fuck . ”
59190	59216	59179	59179	Darcy	69	“ You ’re so dramatic . She ’s getting what she wants . You ’re getting what you want . What ’s the big deal ? ”
59278	59307	59241	59241	She	89	“ Is n’t your wedding day a big day for a woman ? Is n’t it meant to be about love and the start of a life together ? ”
59308	59321	59322	59322	Darcy	69	“ Have you developed a Disney addiction I ’m not aware of ? ”
59329	59362	59322	59322	Darcy	69	“ Scarlett ’s not some naïve eighteen - year - old girl you ’ve tricked into marrying you . She knows what she ’s doing . And anyway , she likes you . ”
59377	59380	59373	59373	Scarlett	89	“ Maybe . ”
59486	59546	59477	59477	she	69	“ I do n’t see how the deal you struck with Scarlett is all that different to all those women you shag on a regular basis . In fact , that ’s much worse , them you use and just do n’t give a shit . So why have you suddenly grown a conscience when it comes to Scarlett ? ”
59547	59554	59556	59556	she	69	“ It ’s not the same . ”
59573	59590	59591	59591	Darcy	69	“ I do n’t pretend anything else is on offer when I sleep with a woman . ”
59594	59605	59591	59591	Darcy	69	“ You said you ’d been completely upfront with Scarlett . ”
59606	59610	59611	59611	I	0	“ I have . ”
59674	59706	59672	59672	her	89	“ You might be feeling like you got the better end of the deal , but as long as you are both happy , then surely that ’s all that matters ? ”
59707	59718	59719	59719	I	0	“ It ’s not too late to call this off . ”
59726	59755	59719	59719	I	0	“ How does that help anyone , you idiot ? Scarlett ends up losing her business . You end up losing yours . You upset Grandfather , me — ”
59756	59764	59765	59765	I	0	“ I do n’t know , okay ? ”
59773	59787	59765	59765	I	0	“ Maybe I can just loan Scarlett the money and talk to Frederick . ”
59819	59910	59804	59804	She	69	“ Do n’t be stupid . Frederick does n’t give two shits about you . He ’d relish the opportunity to hurt you , to ruin you . And anyway , it ’s far too late to try for a deal . If you were to offer him the title and the estate right now in exchange for signing over your business , he ’d laugh in your face . And then what ? If you try to marry Scarlett anyway , he ’d know it was all for show . ”
60046	60061	60062	60062	Darcy	69	“ You could always buy Scarlett a wedding gift as an additional thank you , ”
60085	60095	60098	60098	my	0	“ You know , she ’s not that girl . ”
60154	60169	60170	60170	Darcy	69	“ You do n’t think she ’s interested in the title , do you ? ”
60176	60216	60173	60173	I	0	“ No . Not at all . I just mean that it ’s her business that she ’s trying to save . She ’s very passionate about it . The money is just what she needs to do that . ”
60217	60225	60173	60173	I	0	“ Sounds like someone else I know . ”
60296	60304	60305	60305	Darcy	69	“ Then what are you worried about ? ”
60340	60358	60359	60359	I	0	“ If I was n’t paying her , you think a woman like that would marry me ? ”
60463	60476	60477	60477	she	69	“ If you did n’t need to marry her , would you ? ”
60488	60508	60480	60480	I	0	“ You know I ’m not the marrying kind . Too many women to limit myself to just one . ”
60537	60563	60531	60531	she	69	“ I think she ’d be lucky to marry you even if you were n’t paying her . And something tells me she knows that . ”
60564	60570	60572	60572	she	69	“ What do you mean ? ”
60579	60664	60572	60572	she	69	“ Just that I like the two of you together . I ’ve seen you in uncomfortable situations , making decisions about things that do n’t sit well with you , but when you ’re with Scarlett , I do n’t see any of that . I see you being yourself , the way you really only are with me and Grandfather . Something tells me that if you were n’t such a confirmed bachelor , Scarlett might just be woman enough for you . ”
60724	60736	60737	60737	Scarlett	140	“ The sun will rise before they all get to bed , ”
60770	60780	60781	60781	She	2144	“ They seemed to have had a good time . ”

60907	60911	60912	60912	She	2144	“ Did you ? ”
60923	60938	60912	60912	She	2144	“ Yes . It was so much fun . You ’re a good dancer . ”
60948	60954	60939	60939	I	0	“ You said that already . ”
61027	61048	61049	61049	I	0	“ We ’ve only been married a few hours and I ’m repeating myself . I ’m boring you already . ”
61060	61063	61064	61064	Pop	141	“ Never . ”
61123	61133	61107	61107	I	0	“ It ’s La Perla . You like it ? ”

61577	61589	61568	61568	She	2144	“ Then I ’ll only wear it down from now on . ”
61655	61662	61663	61663	she	2144	“ It ’s our wedding night , ”

61722	61728	61729	61729	she	2144	“ I know you will , ”
61834	61840	61826	61826	she	2144	“ You ’re still dressed . ”
61841	61850	61851	61851	She	2144	“ Yes , too busy looking at you . ”
61921	61946	61907	61907	Scarlett	140	“ Just a few more hours and I ’m going to make you scream so loud Manhattan will have a run on ear plugs . ”
61947	61952	61907	61907	Scarlett	140	“ Hours ? How — ”
61953	61967	61968	61968	I	0	“ It ’s thirty - six hours until we fly to New York . ”
61988	62033	61968	61968	I	0	“ Forty - two hours until we land . Then after customs and the journey into town , I figure it ’s forty - four hours max until I make you come in my apartment where you can be as loud as you like . ”
62047	62055	62056	62056	I	0	“ Are you wet , my bride ? ”
62085	62088	62089	62089	she	2144	“ Always , ”
62092	62116	62089	62089	she	2144	“ I ’m going to fuck you while you ’re wearing that until it ’s worn and ragged and soaked in our come . ”
62192	62196	62197	62197	she	2144	“ Oh God , ”
62200	62217	62197	62197	she	2144	“ No , baby , you need to be quiet for just a few more hours . ”
62218	62234	62197	62197	she	2144	“ I ca n’t . It feels so good and it ’s been too long . ”
62356	62363	62345	62345	I	0	“ Christ , you feel good . ”

62807	62833	62804	62804	she	2144	“ No . I can vouch for the fact you did not pass out . You did , however , make a lot of noise . ”
62900	62922	62923	62923	She	2144	“ Fuck it . I was fucking my wife . What do they expect when you ’re just so goddamn sexy ? ”
62948	62953	62954	62954	I	0	“ You ’re insatiable , ”
62957	62965	62954	62954	I	0	“ With you , apparently I am . ”
62993	63013	62990	62990	she	2144	“ I ’m going to do as much as I can to quench your thirst tonight , Mrs. Westbury . ”
63014	63018	63019	63019	She	2144	“ Big promises . ”
63055	63065	63045	63045	I	0	“ Yes , I think I can keep up . ”
63100	63108	63109	63109	she	2144	“ Let ’s see , shall we ? ”
63553	63559	63560	63560	Cecily	79	“ How are those numbers ? ”
63574	63602	63563	63563	she	79	“ Good , I ’ll have November ’s P&L by the end of the day . And I think it ’s going to be ahead of budget . ”
63614	63634	63603	63603	I	0	“ Awesome . We should celebrate . Do you and Ryder want to come over to dinner this Saturday ? ”
63761	63765	63766	63766	I	0	“ Sounds good . ”
63828	63845	63823	63823	I	0	“ I ’m free but I ’m not sure about Ryder . I can ask him . ”
63913	63927	63928	63928	I	0	“ Okay , let me know . How is shacking up together going ? ”
63964	63969	63944	63944	His	140	“ It ’s different . ”
64013	64029	64034	64034	his	140	“ For both of us I think . We ’re getting used to sharing space . ”
64070	64075	64050	64050	he	140	“ my own space . ”
64206	64214	64215	64215	Cecily	79	“ Have you rented out your apartment ? ”
64221	64225	64218	64218	I	0	“ Not yet . ”
64359	64375	64376	64376	Cecily	79	“ You do n’t hate him though ? I mean , it ’s going okay ? ”
64379	64400	64401	64401	She	79	“ I do n’t hate him at all . He ’s been a perfect gentleman and his family is lovely . ”
64406	64434	64403	64403	her	79	“ A perfect gentleman ? How disappointing . I ’d hoped that maybe there ’d be a spark between you . That it might turn into something . ”
64456	64468	64469	64469	Cecily	79	“ He ’s totally gorgeous . And as rich as God , ”
64522	64528	64518	64518	her	79	“ Speaking of . . . ”
64547	64552	64553	64553	he	75	“ I brought lunch , ”
64581	64586	64587	64587	He	75	“ And a parcel . ”
64598	64610	64611	64611	Cecily	79	“ I ’ll leave you two guys to your married bliss , ”
64619	64622	64623	64623	I	0	“ Hi , ”
64629	64637	64623	64623	I	0	“ I was just thinking about you . ”
64677	64689	64671	64671	He	75	“ I ’ve been thinking about you all morning , too . ”
64733	64740	64741	64741	I	0	“ Will you shut the door ? ”
64744	64752	64741	64741	I	0	“ Sounds good , does it lock ? ”
64819	64829	64846	64846	He	75	“ You feel good . I ’ve missed you . ”
64830	64845	64846	64846	He	75	“ You ca n’t have missed me already . You saw me this morning . ”
64898	64905	64906	64906	he	75	“ It ’s been too long , ”
64923	64926	64927	64927	he	75	“ Hungry ? ”
64941	64962	64963	64963	He	75	“ You did n’t eat much at breakfast so I thought I ’d better make sure lunch came to you . ”
64978	64981	64963	64963	He	75	“ Thanks . ”
65013	65020	65001	65001	he	75	“ You like shellfish , right ? ”
65021	65024	65025	65025	I	0	“ Sure , ”
65052	65061	65062	65062	He	75	“ So what brings you here , husband ? ”
65065	65082	65083	65083	He	75	“ I told you . I missed you . And I wanted to give you this . ”
65132	65137	65138	65138	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
65146	65187	65141	65141	He	75	“ It ’s wrapped up . How would I know ? I ’d forgotten Grandfather gave it to me just before we left for the flight back . I found it when I was rearranging things in your room yesterday . ”
65197	65200	65201	65201	he	75	“ Eat , ”
65291	65306	65307	65307	I	0	“ How was your morning ? Make a billion dollars ? Two billion dollars ? ”
65318	65334	65311	65311	He	75	“ My wealth is meant to impress you . Not provide ammunition for your sarcasm . ”
65338	65353	65335	65335	I	0	“ Oh , thanks for telling me . I ’ll know for next time . ”
65354	65360	65361	65361	he	75	“ Does anything impress you ? ”
65387	65392	65376	65376	I	0	“ Plenty of things . ”
65393	65397	65398	65398	he	75	“ My penis ? ”
65414	65437	65405	65405	I	0	“ Your bed is really comfortable . You have a very impressive mattress . And I sleep like a baby on it . ”
65438	65461	65462	65462	He	75	“ Not what I was hoping you ’d say and it sounds like a problem rather than something to be impressed by . ”
65465	65479	65462	65462	He	75	“ A new bride should n’t be getting a good night ’s sleep . ”
65480	65500	65501	65501	I	0	“ Oh I have no complaints about the amount of sex we ’re having , that ’s for sure . ”
65510	65518	65519	65519	he	75	“ It ’s a lot , huh ? ”
65559	65597	65598	65598	I	0	“ But I think I ’d rather risk my dick falling off than stop . I see you , and I want you . Even now , watching you with that plastic fork is turning me on . ”
65603	65610	65598	65598	I	0	“ Cutlery does it for you ? ”
65619	65626	65611	65611	I	0	“ Where do you want it ? ”
65634	65641	65631	65631	his	75	“ You do it for me . ”
65653	65663	65642	65642	His	75	“ I ca n’t keep my hands off you . ”
65715	65733	65703	65703	He	75	“ Like I said , I ca n’t keep my hands , mouth , dick off you . ”
65739	65745	65734	65734	I	0	“ I ’m not complaining . ”
65776	65780	65781	65781	he	75	“ Open it , ”
65945	65952	65953	65953	Ryder	75	“ A wedding gift from Grandfather ? ”
66061	66066	66067	66067	I	0	“ It ’s beautiful . ”
66080	66090	66067	66067	I	0	“ It was a favorite of my grandmother ’s . ”
66103	66122	66096	66096	Ryder	75	“ I ca n’t accept this . It ’s got such sentimental value to your family , Ryder . ”
66140	66168	66131	66131	He	75	“ Of course you can accept it . You must . My grandfather likes you a great deal , and he obviously wants you to have it . ”
66273	66281	66282	66282	Ryder	75	“ Let me put it on you , ”
66304	66319	66290	66290	I	0	“ I feel like I should n’t . It does n’t belong to me . ”
66329	66346	66347	66347	I	0	“ It does belong to you , though . You ’re the next Duchess of Fairfax . ”
66350	66357	66347	66347	I	0	“ You ca n’t say that . “
66367	66378	66364	66364	your	0	” He pulled out my chair so I faced him . “
66392	66399	66400	66400	I	0	” I tried not to grin . “
66405	66421	66400	66400	I	0	” I took the hand he extended and let him pull me into his arms . “
66429	66439	66424	66424	you	0	” he said , pressing his body against mine . “
66447	66467	66444	66444	I	0	” I linked my arms around his neck as he stared into my eyes , then collapsed into laughter . “
66478	66482	66473	66473	I	0	” he said . “
66521	66536	66537	66537	I	0	” It would be fun to poke about in his kitchen . He winced . “
66542	66571	66537	66537	I	0	” It should n’t have bothered me , but for some reason it did . He had n’t mentioned a dinner . I let go of his neck . “
66588	66598	66581	66581	John	95	” Relief fluttered in my stomach and I smiled . “
66625	66640	66643	66643	I	0	” Ryder pushed his hands through his hair as he leaned on the table . “
66662	66718	66726	66726	I	0	” A public business event I was n’t invited to ? I began to gather up our lunch cartons . A last - minute thing that John had forgotten to tell him about was one thing , but a big business event that had been arranged for months ? Why had n’t he mentioned it ? “
66730	66749	66726	66726	I	0	” I said , sealing the salad container and putting it into the paper bag it came in . “
66756	66760	66726	66726	I	0	” he asked . “
66766	66767	66764	66764	Cecily	79	” “
66783	66787	66770	66770	We	1374	” He nodded . “
66794	66795	66770	66770	We	1374	” “
66805	66855	66770	66770	We	1374	” I wanted him to say he wanted to make it or ask me to rearrange it to a time when he could celebrate with us but he did n’t . He did n’t say anything at all . I dumped the remains of our lunch in the trash . “
66865	66877	66860	66860	I	0	” I started to walk toward the door of the boardroom . “
66883	66899	66860	66860	I	0	” he said . I turned and he handed me the blue velvet jewelry box . “
66902	66903	66860	66860	I	0	” “
66906	66926	66927	66927	I	0	” he said , backing me against the door , his hands braced on either side of my head . “
66945	67073	66770	66770	We	1374	” He had no need to be sorry . It was nice of him to apologize . He did n’t owe me anything . But did I want to wait up for him ? The sex was amazing , but it was pulling me deeper . I wanted to be with him tonight , and every night . The realization hit me like a punch in the face . What was I playing at ? I smiled and nodded , knowing that I would be tucked up in bed , trying my best to sleep when he returned . I needed to create some distance between us . Because more than that ? I wanted him to change the rules . I wanted more . * * * “
67077	67127	66770	66770	We	1374	” I said as I walked into the kitchen to find Ryder sitting on one of the white stools at the breakfast bar . The Wall Street Journal was folded on the counter next to him and a bowl of what looked like fruit and yogurt sat half eaten . “
67134	67187	67357	67357	You	1375	” he asked , his tone neutral and not as if we ’d not seen each other for the longest time since we left for England . I ’d heard Ryder call my name through my closed bedroom door when he ’d returned the night before , but I had n’t responded . “
67190	67356	67357	67357	You	1375	” I replied , which was a total lie . I had n’t slept at all . I ’d lain awake all night , wondering if I ’d made a huge mistake . Not in marrying Ryder and saving Cecily Fragrance from financial ruin , but by not being more cautious in keeping things . . . separate between Ryder and me . Sleeping with him over and over had confused things . Liking it was worse . Wanting anything from him — like for him to want to celebrate my successes with me — was as far as my feelings for Ryder were going to go . The creeping affection I felt for him , the way I wanted to tell him every little thing that happened to me while we were apart , it had to stop . It all had to stop . At least the night of no sleep and the constant churning of my thoughts had given me a plan . “
67363	67402	67403	67403	I	0	” he asked . I glanced up as I poured my coffee to find him staring at me through narrowed eyes . Had he always been so devastatingly handsome ? That would be a yes . I nodded . “
67407	67408	67403	67403	I	0	” “
67411	67420	67421	67421	You	1375	” he said , drawing out the vowels . “
67441	67442	67445	67445	I	0	” “
67464	67480	67481	67481	You	1375	” I needed some space . To regroup . Draw a line in the sand . “
67491	67503	67487	67487	I	0	” he said . I eyed him over my coffee cup . “
67526	67547	67548	67548	Scarlett	89	” I turned and poured the remains of my drink down the sink and put my mug in the dishwasher . “
67550	67579	67548	67548	Scarlett	89	” Ryder said . It was n’t a question , and I did n’t know him well enough to know whether it was going to turn into one . “
67592	67633	67586	67586	I	0	” I closed the dishwasher with a click and headed back to my bedroom . I should n’t have bothered with coffee . He grabbed my wrist as I walked by , forcing me to halt and turn to him . “
67639	67672	67635	67635	I	0	” he asked . I was being a bitch . He had n’t done anything apart from be gorgeous and generous and kind and funny . But it was just too much . “
67677	67686	67635	67635	I	0	” I forced my lips into a smile . “
67706	67751	67692	67692	I	0	” Slowly , he released my arm . Part of me wished he had n’t . If he ’d tried to kiss me , I would have fallen into the pull between us and any hope of keeping my feelings shored up would be gone .
67756	67773	67774	67774	I	0	“ Can you hold my calls and make sure I ’m not disturbed for thirty minutes ? ”
68467	68476	68465	68465	Frederick	72	“ Hi , Fred . How are you ? ”
68501	68519	68524	68524	he	72	“ Ryder . I tried your office line but they told me you were in a meeting . ”
68536	68547	68524	68524	he	72	“ Just finished . What can I help you with ? ”
68590	68612	68582	68583	his lawyer	245	“ You can buy your cousin a drink . I ’m in town and thought we could catch up for dinner . ”
68656	68662	68663	68663	I	0	“ You ’re in Manhattan ? ”
68685	68690	68691	68691	he	72	“ That ’s right , ”
68703	68742	68691	68691	he	72	“ Just in a cab from JFK . Staying at the Mandarin Oriental , but I ’m not in the mood for anything too much . I thought maybe Scarlett could whip us up a stew or something . ”
68763	68786	68748	68748	His	72	“ I ’m not sure Scarlett is a stew kind of woman , but I can make a mean grilled cheese sandwich . ”
68793	68811	68748	68748	His	72	“ Well , whatever you were planning to have for dinner , will it stretch to three ? ”
68812	68822	68758	68758	he	72	“ Scarlett and I have n’t made any plans . ”
68823	68829	68830	68830	he	72	“ No plans for dinner ? ”
68863	68888	68845	68845	he	72	“ I told her to have a big lunch so we did n’t have to waste time eating when we could be in bed . ”
68897	68916	68917	68917	he	72	“ I ’ll be at yours at eight . Grilled cheese , whatever that is , is fine , ”
69228	69239	69223	69223	I	0	“ Mr. Westbury , your guest Mr. Westbury has arrived . ”
69249	69254	69255	69255	I	0	“ Send him up , ”
69436	69439	69440	69440	I	0	“ Hey , ”

69763	69776	69777	69777	he	72	“ Fine . Nice views . So , what ’s for dinner ? ”
69780	69796	69777	69777	he	72	“ I thought we ’d go out . No one cooks in New York City . ”
69797	69824	69825	69825	I	0	“ Well , that is a shame . I was looking forward to a cozy evening in . Do you mind if I use your lavatory ? ”
69835	69848	69849	69849	I	0	“ Sure , the guest bath is just on your left there , ”

70455	70475	70476	70476	she	89	“ Can you put those on the counter ? I ’ve got tarragon chicken if that works for you ? ”

71189	71216	71217	71217	Frederick	72	“ I have to say , this place is n’t what I thought . I ’d expected it to have more of a woman ’s touch , ”
71226	71248	71249	71249	she	89	“ Give me a chance , Frederick . You must know that it was Ryder ’s place before we got married , ”
71256	71275	71249	71249	she	89	“ But I ’ve had a few ideas of what I might like to do with the place . ”
71324	71330	71331	71331	I	0	“ What kind of ideas ? ”
71337	71347	71348	71348	she	89	“ Oh , just some things in the bedrooms , ”

71672	71680	71681	71681	I	0	“ You think that was a test ? ”
71684	71711	71712	71712	He	72	“ Of course it was a test . The man ’s been to New York once in his life and he ’s suddenly here on business . ”
71857	71862	71863	71863	I	0	“ I should go , ”
71871	71874	71875	71875	he	75	“ Go ? ”

71979	72006	72007	72007	I	0	“ I feel like I ’ve done something wrong , but I do n’t know what . Please tell me . Let me make it better . ”
72033	72041	72021	72021	Ryder	75	“ No . It ’s not that . ”
72054	72058	72059	72059	he	75	“ Then what ? ”
72062	72067	72059	72059	he	75	“ I missed you . ”
72100	72114	72115	72115	I	0	“ Scarlett ? Did something happen at work ? Or with your ex ? ”
72132	72141	72142	72142	I	0	“ No , it ’s nothing like that , ”
72145	72151	72142	72142	I	0	“ I ’m just tired . ”
72152	72158	72126	72126	he	75	“ Too tired to talk ? ”

72171	72182	72142	72142	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’ve had such a busy day . ”
72183	72192	72193	72193	he	75	“ So do n’t go to your apartment , ”
72196	72211	72193	72193	he	75	“ I do n’t want to spend two nights without you in my bed . ”
72280	72287	72288	72288	he	75	“ Do n’t leave me tonight , ”
72291	72297	72298	72298	I	0	“ But I have to , ”
72319	72357	72359	72359	he	75	“ Do n’t . Sleeping on your own is n’t allowed . The guest room is not for you to sleep in . And neither is your apartment . You belong in my room . Our room . ”
72388	72391	72392	72392	he	75	“ Scarlett , ”
72442	72450	72431	72431	He	75	“ Where have you been all day ? ”

74132	74185	74219	74219	He	75	“ I ’m going to fuck you again . Nothing between us . Just my skin against yours . And you ’re going to come again and again because you need to understand what you ’re missing when you do n’t sleep in my bed . When you try to avoid me . ”
74306	74327	74328	74328	He	75	“ See how I fill you up ? Nothing else can do that . No one else . Only me . ”
74457	74471	74447	74447	I	0	“ See how quickly you come ? How fast I make you come ? ”

75289	75313	75324	75324	he	1486	“ Sorry , I ’ve just been so busy at work ; it ’s just nice to be at home in the evenings . ”
75405	75434	75402	75402	Violet	82	“ Maybe if you were n’t up fucking all night , you could manage a night out with your sister . Even Harper was saying she missed you . ”

75523	75543	75517	75517	I	0	“ There ’s just a lot going on in the business . But a girls ’ night sounds good . ”

75714	75743	75707	75707	Her	1496	“ I just mean that when your thing with Ryder is over , you might want to change things up a bit . A hipster ’s an option . ”
75775	75822	75765	75765	I	0	“ I ’m not sure hipsters will ever be my type , even if I ’m on my ninth husband , but it ’s not me you ’ll have to convince . I ’m pretty sure Harper will want to go to somewhere uber - glam . ”
75866	75885	75860	75860	she	83	“ Well , it ’s my party , so I ’m picking the place . Does Tuesday work ? ”
75976	75990	76032	76033	my receptionist	1499	“ I think I might be busy on Friday but otherwise . . . ”

76638	76665	76633	76633	John	95	“ An awards ceremony . Waste of bloody time if you ask me , but he ’s convinced I need to be seen at these things . ”

78241	78279	78281	78281	Giles	76	“ We need to transfer the loans you made to Cecily Fragrance to Scarlett and begin proceedings . We can wait three months to file everything but there ’s nothing to stop us getting things ready now . ”
78468	78471	78472	78472	Giles	76	“ Ryder ? ”
78483	78502	78472	78472	Giles	76	“ Well , of course , the loans should be transferred across to Scarlett as soon as possible . ”
78615	78649	78609	78609	I	0	“ Exactly . So I ’ve left an envelope with Scarlett to take back to the US to have her lawyer review , but everything is in order , just as you agreed . ”
78650	78653	78661	78661	She	89	“ Fine . ”
78725	78735	78736	78736	Giles	76	“ You just need to sign here and here , ”
78767	78775	78762	78762	he	1567	“ And here for the divorce application . ”
78782	78795	78776	78776	I	0	“ I think I need to speak to Scarlett about this part . ”
78818	78831	78815	78815	I	0	“ I forgot that I said I ’d help Darcy with something . ”
78904	78907	78908	78908	I	0	“ Scarlett , ”
78957	78960	78961	78961	I	0	“ Scarlett , ”
79120	79123	79124	79124	I	0	“ Scarlett , ”
79257	79260	79253	79253	she	89	“ Ryder . ”
79522	79532	79533	79533	he	1583	“ Sir , can I help you with anything ? ”
79541	79561	79536	79536	I	0	“ No , sorry . I thought you were Scarlett . You have n’t seen her , have you ? ”
79579	79589	79564	79564	his	1583	“ I dropped her off at Heathrow , sir . ”
79597	79608	79564	79564	his	1583	“ Oh , yes . Of course , you did . ”
79615	79634	79564	79564	his	1583	“ Did she leave something behind ? I can have it sent over by courier if needs be . ”
79635	79654	79655	79655	I	0	“ No , that ’s fine . I just was n’t quite sure what time she was leaving . ”
79833	79846	79847	79847	I	0	“ Come on , Darce ! I ’m going to be late . ”
79978	79983	79984	79984	she	69	“ I ’m coming , ”
80011	80016	79999	79999	She	69	“ Where ’s Scarlett ? ”
80044	80048	80049	80049	I	0	“ Come on , ”
80082	80108	80109	80109	I	0	“ You ’re mighty moody today , Ryder . If Scarlett does n’t want to chaperone you to London , it ’s not my fault . ”
80300	80306	80307	80307	Darcy	69	“ What did you do ? ”
80326	80334	80322	80322	I	0	“ Ryder . What happened with Scarlett ? ”
80380	80387	80368	80368	they	1609	“ I ’m busy , Darcy . ”
80409	80420	80421	80421	I	0	“ Lane said Scarlett flew back to New York yesterday . ”
80424	80430	80431	80431	I	0	“ What ’s your point ? ”
80443	80453	80431	80431	I	0	“ What did you do to make her run ? ”
80503	80542	80489	80490	a woman	231	“ I do n’t have time for an argument , Darcy . I did n’t do anything . The estate has passed . She got her money . We ’re done . It ’s as simple as that . ”
80575	80581	80582	80582	Darcy	69	“ You sent her away ? ”
80585	80618	80582	80582	Darcy	69	“ No . If you must know , she did n’t tell me she was leaving . Giles gave her the papers and the next thing I knew , she ’d gone . ”
80649	80662	80679	80679	her	69	“ She just left ? She did n’t say anything to you ? ”
80663	80677	80679	80679	her	69	“ Not a word . Went upstairs to find her to . . . ”
80706	80723	80703	80704	an idiot	733	“ And she ’d cleared out . Signed the papers and got the first plane out . ”
80724	80730	80731	80731	Darcy	69	“ You sound pissed off . ”
80747	80761	80738	80738	she	69	“ I am pissed off . She could have at least said goodbye . ”
80778	80805	80774	80774	her	69	“ I thought . . . I mean , I know it was an arrangement and everything , but you seemed to get on really well . ”
80813	80828	80806	80806	I	0	“ And I thought it was , you know , physical between you two . ”
80837	80847	80829	80829	I	0	“ It was . . . and maybe more . ”
80873	80880	80848	80848	She	69	“ For me , at least . ”
80881	80900	80854	80855	my confidante	1620	“ Did she just say she was n’t interested in things going any further after Grandfather ’s death ? ”
80901	80925	80848	80848	She	69	“ We did n’t even discuss it . I was going to ask her whether she wanted to keep seeing each other but — ”
80926	80932	80933	80933	Darcy	69	“ You never discussed it ? ”
80936	80966	80933	80933	Darcy	69	“ I did n’t have a chance . She just left as soon as she signed the loan documentation , which transferred the loans to her business to her . ”
80967	80987	80848	80848	She	69	“ But you said that she signed the papers . Surely you said something when you handed those over ? ”
80988	80995	80933	80933	Darcy	69	“ Giles gave them to her . ”
80996	80999	81000	81000	Darcy	69	“ What ? ”
81003	81025	81000	81000	Darcy	69	“ He ’s going through all the paperwork . I went to talk to her about it and she ’d gone . ”
81036	81045	81046	81046	I	0	“ Jesus Christ , you ’re an idiot . ”
81053	81080	81046	81046	I	0	“ I know . I should n’t have trusted her , but she fulfilled her end of the bargain . Those loans had to be transferred . ”
81081	81100	81101	81101	She	195	“ Oh my God . I ca n’t believe we ’re related . Are you really that stupid ? ”
81115	81137	81101	81101	She	195	“ Darcy , if you ’re just going to insult me , I have no real interest in continuing this conversation . ”
81138	81164	81165	81165	I	0	“ For some unknown reason , Scarlett liked you . It was obvious how much she cared about you to anyone who bothered to look . ”
81183	81227	81173	81173	Darcy	69	“ She came with you when Grandfather died . She did n’t have to . She had plenty of excuses to stay in America . And given the smile you ’ve worn since you met her , I think you liked her too . ”
81228	81236	81237	81237	I	0	“ You ’re forgetting an important detail , ”
81240	81288	81237	81237	I	0	“ Oh ? Like how you ’re forgetting that Scarlett , who ’s been your wife in every sense of the word for months , got served with divorce papers by some stranger without so much as a thank you from her ungrateful shit of a husband ? ”
81289	81305	81173	81173	Darcy	69	“ I told you — I did n’t know ! Giles took care of it . ”
81306	81313	81314	81314	I	0	“ How would she know that ? ”
81332	81348	81328	81328	Darcy	69	“ Have you been hit on the head or something ? Scarlett was probably devastated . ”
81356	81393	81353	81353	her	69	“ She thought she was building this great relationship with a man and then the first chance he gets , he ends it and does n’t even have the decency to do it to her face . ”
81394	81411	81353	81353	her	69	“ But I did n’t end it . I do n’t even want to end it . ”
81412	81445	81446	81446	I	0	“ How would she know that ? All she knows was that she was in England , supporting you , and the second Grandfather was buried , got handed her marching papers . ”
81498	81517	81482	81482	she	195	“ Why would n’t she say something ? Why would she sign them ? She just ran off . ”
81518	81524	81525	81525	Darcy	69	“ Because she ’s humiliated . ”
81553	81564	81543	81543	she	89	“ You think maybe she did n’t want the divorce ? ”
81578	81650	81543	81543	she	89	“ If you insist on being so bloody obtuse then I really ca n’t continue this conversation . For the first time in your life , you have a shot at a real relationship . With a woman you like and trust . Frankly , you do n’t deserve her if you ’re not going to give her the benefit of the doubt , and realize how much she ’s hurting . ”
81651	81654	81665	81665	Darcy	69	“ Hurting ? ”
81669	81676	81677	81677	Darcy	69	“ Well , are n’t you ? ”
81718	81723	81724	81724	Darcy	69	“ I miss her . ”
81727	81748	81724	81724	Darcy	69	“ Exactly . When have you ever said that about a woman ? And you just threw it all away . ”
81749	81755	81756	81756	I	0	“ Is it too late ? ”
81765	81793	81756	81756	I	0	“ I have no idea . But if she means something to you , I suggest you leg it back to New York and beg her forgiveness . ”
81816	81830	81801	81801	I	0	“ We need to turn around . I need to get to Manhattan . ”
81831	81839	81840	81840	Lane	124	“ That ’s some diversion , sir , ”
81865	81876	81877	81877	Violet	82	“ So , just like that , you ’re divorced ? ”
81944	81953	81956	81956	I	0	“ The paperwork still has to go through . ”
82032	82040	82041	82041	she	82	“ And he did n’t mention it ? ”
82044	82067	82041	82041	she	82	“ No , but like I said , our deal was done . The estate passed and I was no longer useful . ”
82073	82110	82070	82070	her	82	“ That just does n’t seem right . You seemed so happy together in England . The way you looked at each other and touched one another , it was like you were a real couple . ”
82145	82158	82134	82134	I	0	“ Is it nice to be back in your apartment at least ? ”
82167	82170	82159	82159	I	0	“ Sure . ”
82281	82311	82312	82312	Violet	82	“ I ’m worried about you . I know you liked this guy , so why are you pretending that it ’s no big deal that you broke up ? ”
82325	82347	82315	82315	I	0	“ What ’s the alternative ? I ’m sick of being miserable . Crying is n’t going to make me happy . ”
82348	82357	82410	82410	her	82	“ So , you admit you ’re upset ? ”
82358	82379	82315	82315	I	0	“ Is that what you want to hear ? You want me to wallow in how awful my life is ? ”
82388	82403	82404	82404	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s what I want — for you to be miserable . ”
82415	82447	82408	82408	she	82	“ I ’m trying to help . Just be honest with me and tell me what happened . You know what they say , a problem shared is a problem halved . ”
82448	82458	82410	82410	her	82	“ You ’re ridiculous . No one says that . ”
82459	82488	82408	82408	she	82	“ Humor me . I ’m your little sister . You know I get my own way eventually , so just give in now . It ’s easier . ”
82524	82534	82513	82513	I	0	“ I ’ve been such an idiot , Violet . ”
82597	82605	82606	82606	she	82	“ Can we have another two rounds , ”
82627	82637	82638	82638	Violet	82	“ I ’m going to kick his fucking ass , ”
82756	82761	82762	82762	Violet	82	“ What a douchebag , ”
82768	82777	82762	82762	Violet	82	“ But at least you got your company . ”
82858	82868	82869	82869	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe he was so cold , ”
82872	82879	82869	82869	I	0	“ Well , he is British . ”
82922	82944	82945	82946	The duke	2349	“ His grandfather gave me a necklace . I think it led me to hope that maybe we could work out . ”
82980	82998	82975	82975	his	75	“ Ryder ’s grandfather really grew to love his wife — but only after they got married . ”
82999	83013	83014	83014	Violet	82	“ And you were hoping Ryder would grow to love you , too ? ”
83020	83029	83017	83017	I	0	“ How could I have been so naïve ? ”
83030	83039	83040	83040	Violet	82	“ Because you ’d grown to love him , ”
83086	83098	83099	83099	Violet	82	“ You ’re such a good judge of character , normally , ”
83106	83127	83104	83104	herself	82	“ How can you say that ? I ’m about to be divorced for the second time in two years . ”
83128	83152	83104	83104	herself	82	“ Well , when you put it like that . It ’s just that the first guy you married was a good guy — ”
83153	83156	83157	83157	I	0	“ Violet , ”
83160	83176	83157	83157	I	0	“ I do n’t want to hear how my breakups have been all my fault . ”
83177	83251	83104	83104	herself	82	“ I ’m not saying that at all . Hear me out . He was a good guy . You were both just too young . And Ryder ? I mean I did n’t know him that well , but he seemed decent . Seeing you together at the wedding ? I just do n’t get why he ’d just serve you with divorce papers when you had such a good thing going . ”
83252	83266	83157	83157	I	0	“ He saved his company . And mine . The deal is done . ”
83267	83270	83271	83271	Violet	82	“ Maybe , ”
83274	83287	83271	83271	Violet	82	“ There is no maybe . That ’s how it went down . ”
83304	83325	83297	83297	I	0	“ I ’ll be okay . It was just a shock . I ’ll go back to my apartment tomorrow . ”
83362	83383	83352	83352	I	0	“ I thought you were back at your place ? You ’re not staying at his apartment , are you ? ”
83397	83418	83389	83389	I	0	“ No , I just stayed here in the hotel last night . I did n’t want to go home — ”
83419	83429	83384	83384	Violet	82	“ Scarlett , why did n’t you call me ? ”
83430	83442	83470	83470	her	82	“ Because I do n’t want to sleep on your couch . ”
83443	83467	83468	83468	I	0	“ I do n’t want you on my couch either . But I could have come over and had room service on you . ”
83482	83507	83475	83475	she	82	“ I mean it . I love room service . If you ’re staying here tonight , count me in , sister of mine . ”
83549	83565	83566	83566	I	0	“ Shall we go get in our jammies and find a cooking show to watch ? ”
83569	83585	83586	83586	Violet	82	“ Sounds like a great idea . And if he calls , I ’ll answer , ”
83589	83594	83586	83586	Violet	82	“ Has he called ? ”
83600	83630	83595	83595	I	0	“ He wo n’t . The divorce papers said it all . And anyway , I left my cell in England , along with the key to his apartment . ”
83631	83640	83641	83641	I	0	“ How will you get your stuff back ? ”
83644	83679	83641	83641	I	0	“ I was so focused on leaving him I never thought about it . I just wanted to step back through the wardrobe and for him to have been a figment of my imagination . ”
83680	83703	83704	83704	she	1650	“ Oh well , we ’ll figure it out . I can collect your things . And knee him in the balls , ”
83754	83769	83773	83773	she	79	“ God , it ’s so good to have you back in New York , ”
83785	83804	83773	83773	she	79	“ You should have said you ’d be here and I would have cleared my diary this morning . ”
83810	83824	83805	83805	I	0	“ No need . I had a ton of things to get through . ”
83840	83850	83851	83851	she	1650	“ We have so much to catch up on , ”
83865	83878	83851	83851	she	1650	“ I just got a meeting with the beauty buyer for Saks . ”
83886	83891	83892	83892	She	1650	“ Are you kidding ? ”
83898	83928	83892	83892	She	1650	“ Can you believe it ? I ’ve been trying to hold it in all week . I wanted to wait to tell you face - to - face . ”
83939	83945	83934	83934	her	1650	“ Oh , my God . ”
83960	83970	83946	83946	I	0	“ That is amazing . Well done , you . ”
83971	84025	84026	84026	I	0	“ Well done us , you mean . You were the one who told me it was possible . And the one who told me to get back to them even though they said no like four times already . If it had n’t been for you , I would have given up . ”
84032	84039	84026	84026	I	0	“ We ’re a good team . ”
84040	84070	84071	84071	I	0	“ We ’re the best . We need to celebrate . Can you spend an evening away from that gorgeous husband of yours and sample some champagne with me ? ”
84092	84095	84071	84071	I	0	“ Sure . ”
84113	84135	84107	84107	I	0	“ Your hot - as - hell husband is on his way to see you . Did I mention how lucky — ”
84145	84153	84154	84154	Cecily	79	“ What are you so jumpy about ? ”
84157	84166	84154	84154	Cecily	79	“ Cecily , I do n’t want to — ”
84204	84224	84225	84225	I	0	“ I ’d love a man who brought me lunch , or even one who picked up the check . ”
84240	84243	84230	84230	Cecily	79	“ Fuck , ”
84263	84276	84258	84258	Cecily	79	“ What ’s the matter ? Did you two have an argument ? ”
84363	84366	84367	84367	he	75	“ Hello , ”
84389	84399	84400	84400	he	75	“ Cecily , please , can you leave us ? ”
84451	84454	84448	84448	Ryder	75	“ Scarlett . ”
84455	84458	84459	84459	I	0	“ Ryder , ”
84483	84515	84516	84516	He	75	“ Is that all you ’re going to say to me ? You leave England without so much as a goodbye and ‘ Ryder ’s ’ the best you ’ve got ? ”
84543	84549	84550	84550	I	0	“ Why are you here ? ”
84593	84602	84603	84603	he	75	“ Why did n’t you wait for me ? ”
84621	84624	84625	84625	I	0	“ What ? ”
84633	84647	84628	84628	He	75	“ You did n’t even say goodbye , Scarlett . You just left . ”
84672	84708	84670	84670	Unbelievable	149	“ Are you seriously going to pretend that you ’re the wronged party here ? When you did n’t have the balls to ask me for a divorce in person rather than having me served ? ”
84779	84784	84785	84785	he	75	“ Darcy was right , ”
84808	84834	84797	84797	He	75	“ I have a lot to get through this morning . Surely , anything you need to discuss , you can handle through your lawyer . ”
84872	84886	84887	84887	he	75	“ I did n’t know that Giles had drawn up the divorce papers , ”
84904	84920	84921	84921	I	0	“ And I certainly did n’t know that he ’d had them delivered to you . ”
84933	84942	84943	84943	He	75	“ Lawyers do n’t just draft divorce papers . ”
84948	84979	84943	84943	He	75	“ Honestly , Giles thought he was being helpful . I had no idea he was even thinking about drafting those papers , let alone had delivered them to you . ”
84985	84999	85000	85000	I	0	“ We were staying in the same house . In the same bed , ”
85003	85016	85000	85000	I	0	“ I know . You must think I ’m a total bastard . ”
85027	85054	85055	85055	he	75	“ But I do n’t get why you would think I would . I mean , that ’s not who I am and you know that , ”
85063	85076	85055	85055	he	75	“ I care too much about you to do something so callous . ”
85152	85167	85168	85168	I	0	“ Why did n’t you say anything ? How could you just walk out ? ”
85177	85231	85232	85232	He	1666	“ Are you freaking kidding me ? How is this my fault ? Your grandfather died and my services were no longer required . Fine . I took the hint . Do n’t you dare turn this around to try to make me feel bad about a situation I feel bad enough about . ”
85250	85255	85256	85256	I	0	“ You better go , ”
85259	85291	85256	85256	I	0	“ Scarlett , seriously , I ’m sorry . But you have to believe me , I did n’t send you those papers . Divorce was the last thing I wanted . ”
85301	85323	85292	85292	He	1666	“ Sure it was . You can get back to screwing anything and everything . You are officially a free man . ”
85335	85356	85357	85357	My	0	“ What happens if I do n’t want to be a free man ? I do n’t want a divorce . ”
85468	85483	85484	85484	I	0	“ I ’d say it ’s impossible . I ’m not a good wife , ”
85487	85494	85484	85484	I	0	“ You ’re the best wife . ”
85518	85541	85513	85513	him	75	“ I was a fake wife with you , do n’t you get it ? I ’m not good in real relationships . ”
85603	85652	85599	85599	He	75	“ That ’s just not true . I ’ve never opened up to anyone other than my family the way I ’ve opened up to you . You know me in a way that no one else has . Can we talk about this ? About . . . ”
85672	85704	85663	85663	he	75	“ About what , Ryder ? There ’s no point . It ’s better this way . You ’ll be better without me . And I ’m better on my own . ”
85716	85726	85727	85727	he	75	“ I want to talk about us , Scarlett , ”
85734	85773	85727	85727	he	75	“ I want to have a conversation about our relationship , our marriage and the fact that for the first time in my life , I ’m in love with a woman . My wife , in fact . ”
85808	85815	85730	85730	his	75	“ You ca n’t love me . ”
85816	85852	85792	85792	his	75	“ How can you say that ? We ’ve shared our lives , our bodies , our everything these past months — I love you . And I think you feel the same about me . ”
85853	85883	85891	85891	I	0	“ Look , I accept that you did n’t mean for the divorce papers to be sent to me at that time . But it does n’t change anything . ”
85884	85890	85730	85730	his	75	“ Surely that changes everything . ”
85967	85995	85950	85950	him	75	“ It changes nothing . We always knew our time was limited . It ’s up now , and we need to get on with our lives . ”
85996	86010	86011	86011	He	75	“ I do n’t want to get on with my life without you . ”
86037	86066	86018	86018	his	75	“ I ’m sure you ’ll do just fine . I bet by the end of the month , you wo n’t be able to remember my name . ”
86067	86093	86018	86018	his	75	“ How can you say that ? I just told you I ’m in love with you . Does n’t that mean anything to you ? ”
86121	86134	86112	86112	he	75	“ It does n’t mean enough . It does n’t mean forever . ”
86215	86221	86198	86198	I	0	“ I have a meeting . ”
86259	86266	86267	86267	I	0	“ See you around , Ryder , ”
86299	86305	86306	86306	John	95	“ You ’re a mess , ”
86352	86358	86330	86330	John	95	“ The maid comes tomorrow . ”
86359	86382	86383	86383	I	0	“ I do n’t just mean your apartment . Look at you . You ’re wearing track pants for crying out loud . ”
86404	86415	86398	86398	I	0	“ I was just about to go to the gym . ”
86416	86433	86434	86434	He	95	“ You ’re a shitty fucking liar . It looks like you slept in those clothes . ”
86444	86464	86434	86434	He	95	“ And since when do you eat pizza and drink beer ? I thought your body was a temple . ”
86465	86484	86485	86485	He	95	“ What are you , my mother ? Give me whatever it is you brought and fuck off . ”
86495	86500	86501	86501	he	95	“ Where ’s Scarlett ? ”
86507	86519	86504	86504	I	0	“ I have no idea . At work , I presume . ”
86520	86533	86485	86485	He	95	“ You presume ? Are n’t you two joined at the hip ? ”
86534	86553	86504	86504	I	0	“ My grandfather died . She has her money . I have my company . End of story . ”
86554	86566	86567	86567	John	95	“ Oh , so that ’s what we ’re dealing with . ”
86633	86647	86648	86648	He	95	“ I do n’t have time for this . Why are you here ? ”
86656	86680	86648	86648	He	95	“ It all makes sense now , my friend . The pizza boxes . The elasticized pants . The clear aversion to showering . ”
86704	86720	86721	86721	he	95	“ You ca n’t just not come to work because you and Scarlett broke up , ”
86724	86760	86721	86721	he	95	“ Pick up a sport , go buy a Bugatti , bang some other chick , hell , have a threesome . But get your shit together . We ’ve got a business to run . ”
86761	86776	86786	86786	he	95	“ I ’m sick . I must have picked it up on the plane — ”
86794	86815	86786	86786	he	95	“ You fly private , you dick . People who fly private do n’t pick up germs on a plane . ”
86816	86834	86835	86835	I	0	“ Well , I ’m not a doctor . I do n’t know where I caught it . ”
86843	86861	86835	86835	I	0	“ My muscles are wound tighter than a corkscrew , and I ’ve got a wicked headache . ”
86862	86871	86786	86786	he	95	“ More like a bad case of heartache . ”
86872	86878	86786	86786	he	95	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
86879	86909	86835	86835	I	0	“ You might not recognize it , and who could blame you ? The only organ you ’ve been using around women all these years is your tiny dick — ”
86910	86936	86937	86937	He	1685	“ Hey , now that ’s a step too far . My dick is plenty big enough , thank you . You ’re just jealous . ”
86942	86962	86963	86963	He	1685	“ Sort your shit out . You ’re never going to get back in the game looking like that . ”
86976	86991	86963	86963	He	1685	“ This is New - York - Fucking - City . Women have standards . ”
87100	87123	87084	87084	I	0	“ What the fuck are you doing with that blanket ? Have you reverted to your five - year - old self ? ”
87124	87129	87130	87130	Her	89	“ I ’m cold . ”
87146	87170	87130	87130	Her	89	“ Then do some exercise or put on a sweater . My God . Did Scarlett take your balls when she moved out ? ”
87193	87219	87181	87181	I	0	“ What do I do , man ? I ca n’t sleep . I ca n’t eat . I think about her all the time . ”
87236	87241	87242	87242	he	95	“ Aww , shit , ”
87245	87268	87242	87242	he	95	“ I ’m sorry . I can see you ’re really cut up about it . I thought you were just sulking . ”
87272	87288	87269	87269	I	0	“ I ’ve never been in this situation before . Women do n’t leave me . ”
87299	87316	87289	87289	I	0	“ So now you care about someone and you just give up ? Just like that ? ”
87317	87336	87337	87337	I	0	“ What else can I do ? I ca n’t force her to want to be with me . ”
87350	87362	87289	87289	I	0	“ All I know is that this hurts like a bitch . ”
87363	87397	87398	87398	I	0	“ I know . Unlike you , I ’ve had my heart broken before . But you ’ll get it . But first , I ’m going to burn all your sweat pants . ”
87415	87455	87412	87412	I	0	“ Why do n’t you get cleaned up and we ’ll go hit some bars , talk to a few girls — you know you ’ll feel better when you have some hot , naked woman in your bed . ”
87465	87480	87488	87488	he	1691	“ The only hot , naked girl I want in my bed is Scarlett . ”
87481	87487	87488	87488	he	1691	“ Then make it happen , ”
87491	87506	87488	87488	he	1691	“ I told you , I ca n’t make her come back to me . ”
87515	87535	87507	87507	He	1691	“ You ’re Ryder - fucking - Westbury . You want her back , then you get her back . ”
87536	87564	87565	87565	He	1691	“ It ’s not that simple . I really hurt her . And now she does n’t want me back . Says she ’s bad at relationships . ”
87571	87581	87565	87565	He	1691	“ That ’s good . Do n’t you see ? ”
87589	87604	87582	87582	He	1691	“ That you ’re being a callous bastard ? Yeah , that ’s clear . ”
87605	87635	87507	87507	He	1691	“ Jesus , you ’re touchy . I meant , obviously if she was that upset , then she cares . . . and it ’s not too late . ”
87636	87677	87582	87582	He	1691	“ She walked out . Told me it was over — that we were better off apart . I was an idiot . I served her with divorce papers . Well , I did n’t serve her , my law — ”
87678	87702	87703	87703	I	0	“ Look , I do n’t care . If you want her back , get off your ass and go get her back . ”
87708	87715	87703	87703	I	0	“ You make it sound simple . ”
87753	87769	87746	87746	I	0	“ I need two flipcharts , some Sharpies and a lot of Post - its . ”
87770	87776	87777	87777	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
87786	87793	87777	87777	I	0	“ We are making a plan . ”
87794	87798	87746	87746	I	0	“ A plan ? ”
87799	87812	87746	87746	I	0	“ To get Scarlett back — assuming that ’s what you want ? ”
87813	87828	87777	87777	I	0	“ Of course that ’s what I want . I love her , man . ”
87829	87837	87838	87838	He	1692	“ Have I ever steered you wrong ? ”
87849	87860	87838	87838	He	1692	“ Well , there was that one time in Vegas — ”
87861	87865	87866	87866	he	1692	“ Not funny , ”
87878	87909	87866	87866	he	1692	“ So , the plan . Step one — get your smelly ass in the shower then dressed in pants that have a fly . Then we ’ll get started . ”
87914	87924	87925	87925	I	0	“ Thanks , just put it on the counter , ”
87977	87985	87986	87986	Violet	82	“ Who sends a basket of DVDs ? ”
87994	88005	87986	87986	Violet	82	“ It ’s better than the kale that arrived yesterday . ”
88006	88043	88044	88044	Violet	82	“ Someone sent you a basket of kale ? That ’s sick . Are n’t you meant to get champagne and truffles ? Or dim sum ? Has New York changed so much since Working Girl ? ”
88048	88070	88044	88044	Violet	82	“ You were n’t even born when Working Girl released . It ’s not like the eighties were your glory days . ”
88071	88096	88097	88097	I	0	“ No , they were New York ’s glory days . Now this place is all kale smoothies and working nineteen hours a day . ”
88119	88129	88130	88130	Violet	82	“ Speaking of classic movies , these are good , ”
88171	88177	88178	88178	Violet	82	“ Who are they from ? ”
88181	88184	88178	88178	Violet	82	“ Ryder , ”
88226	88233	88234	88234	I	0	“ Ryder ? To say sorry ? ”
88237	88248	88234	88234	I	0	“ I have no idea . I ’m not interested . ”
88249	88255	88256	88256	she	82	“ Have you seen him ? ”
88264	88289	88256	88256	she	82	“ Yes , I told you that he came by and said he did n’t know the divorce papers had been sent to me . ”
88290	88303	88304	88304	She	82	“ But , I thought you had n’t heard from him since ? ”
88323	88351	88313	88313	she	82	“ Yeah . That lasted for about a week , then I got an email . Then these deliveries started to arrive twice a day like clockwork . ”
88352	88357	88358	88358	She	82	“ Twice a day ? ”
88366	88372	88358	88358	She	82	“ What does that say ? ”
88398	88404	88390	88390	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
88405	88416	88417	88417	She	82	“ Then I ’ll open it if you do n’t . ”
88439	88460	88461	88461	she	82	“ I miss Friday night movie night . I miss you . I love you . Your husband , Ryder , ”
88464	88483	88461	88461	she	82	“ Scarlett . Wow — you ca n’t just ignore this . What are you going to do ? ”
88484	88490	88491	88491	I	0	“ Nothing , of course , ”
88500	88511	88491	88491	I	0	“ It ’s over . He ’ll get bored eventually . ”
88512	88520	88521	88521	She	82	“ Scarlett . He ’s wooing you . ”
88532	88549	88521	88521	She	82	“ It ’s like a movie or something . Why do n’t you want him to ? ”
88550	88562	88491	88491	I	0	“ It ’s better this way . We ’re both free . ”
88586	88619	88629	88629	she	82	“ Hey , when did you get so cynical ? He ’s saying he loves you . And I imagine a lot of women have waited to hear those words from him . ”
88620	88627	88629	88629	she	82	“ Thanks for that , Violet . ”
88644	88674	88629	88629	she	82	“ I ’m just saying , this is n’t a man who needs to work for it , but he is . I think he really cares about you . ”
88675	88742	88743	88743	I	0	“ So ? Honestly , Violet , why prolong the inevitable ? If I was to call him up now and say , okay , let ’s go back to how things were — or whatever he thinks he wants to do — eventually it ’s going to end . It ’s always going to end . I ’m just skipping to the good part here . ”
88766	88778	88759	88759	I	0	“ There ’s no point in going through a breakup twice . ”
88779	88800	88801	88801	She	1707	“ You do n’t know that . Maybe it will work out and you ’ll grow old . Have babies . ”
88813	88822	88801	88801	She	1707	“ Life does n’t work out like that . ”
88823	88850	88851	88851	I	0	“ Mom and Dad worked out like that . Harper and Max are doing a good impression of a happy couple . Love finds a way . ”
88862	88867	88851	88851	I	0	“ Not for me . ”
88868	88904	88854	88854	her	1707	“ Then , my gorgeous sister , tell me why you accept these deliveries ? If you ’re so convinced you and Ryder are n’t meant to be , why do n’t you reject them ? ”
88927	88942	88924	88924	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I do n’t want to make a scene . ”
88958	88974	88943	88943	I	0	“ Well if you say so . Did you go back and get your stuff ? ”
88975	88991	88924	88924	I	0	“ No . I asked him to box it up and send it to me . ”
88992	88998	88943	88943	I	0	“ What did he say ? ”
88999	89002	89003	89003	His	1708	“ No . ”
89035	89051	89052	89052	Violet	82	“ Look , there ’s no point in talking about it . It ’s over . ”
89055	89071	89052	89052	Violet	82	“ I do n’t think even you believe that . And I certainly do n’t . ”
89097	89106	89107	89107	he	254	“ Sorry , dude , I forgot this , ”
89117	89121	89122	89122	she	82	“ More gifts , ”
89125	89142	89143	89143	she	82	“ If you do n’t like it and it ’s expensive , can I keep it ? ”
89151	89158	89143	89143	she	82	“ Do n’t be a brat . ”
90049	90056	90043	90043	I	0	“ Scarlett King for Ryder Westbury . ”
90146	90157	90158	90158	he	75	“ Lyndsey , please make sure I ’m not interrupted , ”
90168	90177	90158	90158	he	75	“ I ’m having lunch with my wife . ”
90275	90278	90279	90279	he	75	“ Thanks , ”
90291	90296	90297	90297	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , ”
90322	90327	90328	90328	he	75	“ I ’m sorry , ”
90337	90342	90343	90343	I	0	“ We did that , ”
90346	90359	90343	90343	I	0	“ You apologized and explained . That ’s not where we are . ”
90368	90374	90363	90363	Ryder	75	“ Where are we then ? ”
90375	90383	90384	90384	He	75	“ In your office , having lunch . ”
90391	90396	90384	90384	He	75	“ You ’re funny . ”
90397	90401	90402	90402	I	0	“ I know . ”
90444	90451	90452	90452	he	75	“ Are we husband and wife ? ”
90455	90460	90461	90461	I	0	“ I ’m scared , ”
90490	90511	90512	90512	he	75	“ Whatever it is that you ’re afraid of , I ’ll stand between you and it my whole life , ”
90515	90534	90512	90512	he	75	“ But I ’m scared of us . Of me . Of my choices . Of losing you . ”
90535	90542	90543	90543	he	75	“ You ’ll never lose me , ”
90546	90561	90543	90543	he	75	“ I just want to make this right between us . Tell me how . ”
90576	90606	90571	90571	he	75	“ You ca n’t promise that I ’ll never lose you . No one can . And that ’s what ’s so terrifying . My first divorce . . . ”
90634	90685	90571	90571	he	75	“ It was like pouring bleach over everything I ever wanted . I had to start again . And I ’m not sure I know if I could ever do that again . We were never the beginning of anything — just a means to an end , an adventure . ”
90704	90725	90693	90693	I	0	“ But is n’t that always how the best beginnings start ? When you do n’t know what to expect ? ”
90726	90729	90772	90772	his	75	“ Maybe . ”
90735	90752	90753	90753	He	75	“ I know I ca n’t just walk away . You mean too much to me . ”
90759	90768	90753	90753	He	75	“ Scarlett , we can make this work . ”
90844	90852	90833	90833	he	75	“ I hate to see you cry . ”
90853	90858	90833	90833	he	75	“ It ’s relief . ”
90859	90863	90864	90864	he	75	“ What is ? ”
90867	90901	90864	90864	he	75	“ That you did n’t throw me out for being crazy . That it was more than a contract for you too . That . . . that I ’m here with you . ”
90902	90909	90910	90910	he	75	“ Nothing makes sense without you , ”
90913	90964	90910	90910	he	75	“ I feel like the last few weeks I ’ve been treading water until I got you back . All these years without parents , I ’m so used to being independent , self - reliant and you come along and within months , I need you just to function . ”
90996	91027	90988	90988	myself	0	“ We went into this marriage as strangers and now — you’re my lover , my teammate , my soulmate . The woman I love . You ’re my wife . ”
91028	91038	91039	91039	I	0	“ So , where do we go from here ? ”
91042	91051	91052	91052	he	75	“ I want to be married to you , ”

91077	91110	91072	91072	he	75	“ I know , and I burned the papers you signed . I meant that I want to be with you . Stay married to you — share a life with you . ”
91120	91141	91142	91142	I	0	“ I want that , too . I just need to know that you ’ll always let me in here , ”
91152	91202	91142	91142	I	0	“ I accept that people change and maybe feelings do , too , but not out of the blue . I need you to share your feelings with me . I was blindsided by my first husband . That ca n’t happen to me again . Not with you . ”
91203	91213	91247	91247	his	75	“ I can do that . I love you . ”
91214	91231	91142	91142	I	0	“ I love you , too . More than I thought I could love a person . ”
91257	91267	91268	91268	I	0	“ Does the door lock in this conference room ? ”
91279	91288	91268	91268	I	0	“ This wife wants to fuck her husband . ”
91289	91321	91342	91342	Ryder	140	“ Well , my duchess , I ’m going to insist I take you home for that . I ’m not willing to share your screams with everyone waiting in reception . ”
91322	91338	91268	91268	I	0	“ Well , the car better be ready . Because I ’ve waited long enough . ”
91489	91498	91499	91499	I	0	“ I wo n’t let anything disturb this , ”
91584	91587	91588	91588	she	1751	“ Ryder , ”

91880	91887	91888	91888	I	0	“ Someone needs to lie down , ”
91901	91912	91913	91913	she	1751	“ I ’d forgotten how good you were at that , ”
91937	91941	91942	91942	I	0	“ You forgot ? ”
91948	91976	91945	91945	She	1751	“ I have a bad memory . You ’re going to have to remind me of those other things you used to do to me as well . ”
91997	92001	91977	91977	I	0	“ Other things ? ”
92002	92011	92012	92012	I	0	“ Yeah , you know . Naked things . ”
92026	92047	92012	92012	I	0	“ I ’d be very happy to remind you of it all . I want it etched on your brain . ”
92090	92093	92094	92094	she	1751	“ Stop , ”
92106	92114	92094	92094	she	1751	“ We ’ve not thought this through . ”
92127	92139	92146	92146	she	1751	“ Hey , I ’ve done nothing but think this through . ”
92157	92178	92146	92146	she	1751	“ We should talk practicalities before we — I mean I do n’t want to think everything is fine and — ”
92179	92183	92184	92184	I	0	“ What practicalities ? ”
92194	92208	92184	92184	I	0	“ I have a condom if that ’s what you mean , but — ”
92230	92268	92269	92269	I	0	“ I ’m not kidding , we have n’t discussed a prenup , whether or not we want kids , where we ’re going to live . . . Do you see yourself going back to England ? ”
92292	92333	92285	92285	her	1751	“ Scarlett , I do n’t need a prenup because we ’re never getting divorced . And I want as many kids as you do , and I do n’t care where we live as long as we ’re together . ”
92334	92344	92345	92345	she	1751	“ What if I said I want twelve kids ? ”
92361	92378	92379	92379	I	0	“ Then we ’ll have twelve kids , and I ’ll enjoy making them with you . ”
92391	92413	92379	92379	I	0	“ I do n’t want twelve kids . Maybe three . But I do n’t want to live in your apartment . ”
92414	92432	92433	92433	She	1751	“ Three is good . And pick a home . You want to move back to Connecticut ? ”
92438	92470	92433	92433	She	1751	“ My life in Connecticut is over . I ’m ready for a new life with you . I want to be in Manhattan , but I like England and Woolton . ”
92471	92506	92507	92507	She	1751	“ We can visit a lot . I ’ll contact some real estate agents tomorrow and we ’ll start looking for a new place together . Three kids are going to require a yard . ”
92510	92516	92507	92507	She	1751	“ You ’re thinking ahead . ”
92517	92523	92524	92524	I	0	“ To our life together , ”

92659	92664	92665	92665	I	0	“ Works for me , ”
92837	92851	92852	92852	I	0	“ I never want you to forget how I can make you feel , ”
92858	92892	92852	92852	I	0	“ How I ’ll always make you feel . You ’re never to forget that you ’re mine , Duchess . That ’s just how it is and how it will always be . ”
92936	92945	92946	92946	Darcy	69	“ It ’s so good to see you , ”
92949	92955	92946	92946	Darcy	69	“ Was the flight terrible ? ”
93092	93102	93103	93103	Scarlett	140	“ The flight was fine . Except no champagne , ”
93106	93109	93103	93103	Scarlett	140	“ Urgh , ”
93113	93119	93110	93110	Darcy	69	“ That ’s the worst . ”
93120	93125	93126	93126	Violet	82	“ I had champagne , ”
93138	93150	93151	93151	Darcy	69	“ You ’re going to need it to get through dinner , ”
93154	93160	93161	93161	she	82	“ Nobody have a cow , ”
93178	93185	93186	93186	I	0	“ Tell me you did n’t , ”
93214	93226	93209	93209	Lane	124	“ It was n’t my choice . They invited themselves over . ”
93227	93230	93231	93231	Violet	82	“ Who ? ”
93240	93247	93248	93248	Violet	82	“ My cousin and his wife . ”
93251	93256	93257	93257	she	82	“ Fred and Vi , ”
93282	93293	93294	93294	Darcy	69	“ Honestly , they seem to be making an effort , ”
93297	93322	93294	93294	Darcy	69	“ I guess what ’s done is done . And you have a few hours to sleep a little before they arrive at seven . ”
93340	93345	93346	93346	She	69	“ You did it . ”
93351	93356	93346	93346	She	69	“ It ’s perfect . ”
93357	93369	93370	93370	Violet	82	“ Lane and Mrs. MacBee do n’t approve , of course , ”
93373	93382	93383	93383	Scarlett	140	“ It looks great . Good for you , ”
93414	93422	93423	93423	I	0	“ What are you two shrieking about ? ”
93426	93432	93433	93433	Scarlett	140	“ The carpet , silly , ”
93436	93456	93433	93433	Scarlett	140	“ Do you like it ? Darcy wondered if she should ask you but I said you trusted her . ”
93457	93461	93462	93462	I	0	“ The carpet ? ”
93470	93478	93479	93480	my sister	195	“ Oh , good lord , Ryder , ”
93483	93506	93479	93480	my sister	195	“ I ’ve replaced the worn , fraying carpet that had been down a half century . You did n’t even notice ? ”
93513	93519	93520	93520	I	0	“ Sure . Looks good , ”
93531	93549	93520	93520	I	0	“ You do n’t mind that I did n’t ask ? I know it ’s your house . ”
93550	93563	93564	93564	I	0	“ It ’s just as much your house as mine , Darce . ”
93577	93612	93613	93613	I	0	“ You can do what you like with it . The carpet is great . I know you love this place , and you ’re not going to do anything but look after it , ”
93616	93643	93613	93613	I	0	“ Things ca n’t stay the same forever . Grandfather would n’t have wanted that . He ’d want you to do what made you happy . ”
93644	93682	93717	93717	her	69	“ And about that . . . I know Grandfather ran everything on a skeleton staff , but I really think we need some admin personnel . I know it ’s indulgent . It ’s just that — ”
93683	93714	93715	93715	Darcy	69	“ I think that ’s a great idea . I do n’t want you tied to this place . You need to go out and have a life , too . ”
93725	93729	93717	93717	her	69	“ Thank you . ”
93730	93736	93737	93737	Scarlett	140	“ Come to New York , ”
93740	93748	93737	93737	Scarlett	140	“ We can find you a man . ”
93749	93754	93755	93755	Darcy	69	“ I prefer horses , ”
93758	93763	93764	93764	Violet	82	“ Men smell better , ”
93772	93816	93767	93767	She	82	“ Well , not all of them . But you should come to New York . I hate being the only single girl at dinner . Sometimes I feel like I ’m going to be asked to sit at the kids ’ table . ”
93860	93876	93851	93851	I	0	“ You never know , I might make it stateside when the baby ’s born . ”
93877	93908	93947	93947	her	1779	“ I ’m going to hold you to that . For now , I ’m going to take my wife upstairs and make sure she ’s well rested before dinner . ”
93935	93943	93944	93944	She	1779	“ It feels good to be back . ”
93969	93979	93958	93958	She	1779	“ Oh look , someone ’s changed things around . ”
94089	94094	94095	94095	I	0	“ You look beautiful , ”
94120	94134	94098	94098	I	0	“ You have to say that . I ’m pregnant with your child . ”
94135	94146	94147	94147	She	1779	“ I have to say that because it ’s true . ”
94166	94181	94157	94157	she	1779	“ Do you think we can play a little croquet while we ’re here ? ”
94182	94185	94186	94186	I	0	“ Yes , ”
94221	94226	94227	94227	she	1779	“ Need a drink ? ”

94275	94279	94280	94280	she	1779	“ Just you , ”
94298	94303	94293	94293	She	1779	“ What are you — ”
94304	94350	94351	94351	I	0	“ Scarlett Westbury , when I invited you home the first night I met you , I could never have known how you would change my life . Change me . And when I suggested our arrangement , it was hardly the proposal you deserved . ”
94401	94478	94386	94387	My wife	2144	“ It was here at Woolton that I fell in love with you . So I wanted to wait until we were back , overlooking the lawn where we had our first disagreement because that was the moment I realized you were the first person outside my family whose good opinion I desired . In this house that you helped me secure and in this room where I first made love to you as my wife . ”
94495	94522	94523	94523	She	1795	“ I want to ask you to do me the honor of wearing this ring , as my wife , for the rest of our lives . ”
94545	94565	94538	94538	she	1795	“ Ryder , I would be as honored to wear that ring as I am to be your wife . ”
94581	94590	94591	94591	She	1795	“ What did I do to deserve you ? ”
94594	94617	94618	94618	She	1795	“ Well , I ’ve had a lot of nice jewelry since I got married to you , so there ’s that . ”
94642	94653	94631	94631	I	0	“ And you know — you’ve got a huge penis . ”
94666	94672	94673	94673	I	0	“ You ’re so romantic , ”
94676	94704	94673	94673	I	0	“ And there ’s your big heart and the way you love me . You ’d stand between me and a bullet , and I know that . ”
94712	94734	94673	94673	I	0	“ The way you do whatever it takes to make me happy , even if it just means bringing me lunch . ”
94735	94742	94743	94743	I	0	“ You ’ve thought about this , ”
94760	94771	94772	94772	she	1795	“ Every day I think about how lucky I am , ”

94808	94814	94799	94799	she	1795	“ Did you feel that ? ”
94823	94826	94799	94799	she	1795	“ Scarlett ? ”
94827	94847	94799	94799	she	1795	“ That ’s our baby joining in this moment . It ’s the first time I ’ve felt kicking . ”
94848	94853	94854	94854	I	0	“ That ’s unbelievable . ”
94894	94899	94891	94891	she	1795	“ You ’re unbelievable . ”

95040	95059	95035	95035	him	370	“ It ’s Gwendoline ’s first birthday tomorrow . Give my body a break ; we have time . ”
95112	95125	95126	95126	Ryder	140	“ This one needs a little brother to take care of her , ”
95129	95142	95143	95143	Max	98	“ God , please , we need some more testosterone around here , ”
95146	95153	95154	95154	I	0	“ Are you having another girl ? ”
95157	95178	95154	95154	I	0	“ We do n’t know yet , but seriously , if it ’s another girl , you can have it . ”
95190	95197	95198	95198	I	0	“ You do n’t mean that , ”
95201	95214	95198	95198	I	0	“ I do n’t . But I ’d really like a son . ”
95215	95233	95234	95234	Ryder	140	“ I do n’t mind what we have as long as all twelve of them are healthy , ”
95237	95240	95241	95241	Max	98	“ Twelve ? ”
95244	95276	95277	95277	Ryder	140	“ Well , when you ’ve had three daughters , tell me again that you do n’t want a son . All that pink . It gets to be too much . ”
95294	95308	95309	95309	I	0	“ I ’m not committing to anything more than two at the moment , ”
95312	95316	95309	95309	I	0	“ Two what ? ”
95326	95340	95341	95341	Max	98	“ I ’m so pleased you made it ; how ’s the house ? ”
95344	95369	95341	95341	Max	98	“ Oh my God , we ’re buried in boxes and contractors . Who knew a nineteenth century farmhouse would be so much work ? ”
95379	95422	95370	95370	Grace	84	“ I ’m so glad I hired people to decorate . We turned up with our suitcases last night . I ca n’t take any credit . Apart from the art . We have the most beautiful Chagall in the dining room . ”
95423	95433	95434	95434	Sam	160	“ It ’s colorful , that ’s for sure , ”
95445	95458	95440	95440	Grace	84	“ It will grow on you , my love . I promise . ”

95509	95530	95531	95531	Grace	84	“ Something tells me it ’s not her baby brother she ’s worried about . But she ’ll be fine . ”
95534	95548	95549	95549	she	84	“ And we ’re only up here on weekends . You ’re next , ”
95560	95567	95568	95568	Ryder	140	“ I love it up here , ”
95582	95585	95576	95576	Gwendoline	158	“ Really ? ”
95586	95606	95571	95571	I	0	“ Of course . It ’s nice to get out of the city without having to fly to England . ”
95607	95615	95576	95576	Gwendoline	158	“ Yes , the trip ’s shorter . ”
95616	95620	95621	95621	Harper	83	“ What trip ? ”
95636	95658	95629	95629	Max	98	“ You know we have a thousand square feet of patio to socialize on with enough chairs for everyone , right ? ”
95659	95675	95676	95676	Max	98	“ We ’re trying to convince Ryder and Scarlett to buy a place up here , ”
95679	95686	95687	95687	He	98	“ You interrupted our sales pitch . ”
95696	95711	95691	95691	his	98	“ Now that we ’re all here , let ’s go get some beers . ”
95736	95744	95745	95745	He	140	“ You want a place in Connecticut ? ”
95766	95797	95754	95754	she	158	“ Yeah , I think it would be nice to have a place up here with your family . But I know that it ’s maybe not what you want . ”
95846	95854	95855	95855	I	0	“ I think it would be great , ”
95876	95889	95855	95855	I	0	“ You do n’t mind not going back to Britain so often ? ”
95890	95930	95855	95855	I	0	“ My life is here with you and our family . We ’ll still visit and Darcy can come over and stay . I actually saw a plot of land a couple of weeks ago that might be perfect . ”
95931	95934	95855	95855	I	0	“ Land ? ”
95944	95961	95938	95938	he	140	“ About a mile from here . Maybe we can go and take a look tomorrow . ”
95962	95988	95855	95855	I	0	“ Okay . But there ’s something we have to do before that . And we have to be home to prepare for the party . ”
95989	95992	95993	95993	I	0	“ What ? ”
