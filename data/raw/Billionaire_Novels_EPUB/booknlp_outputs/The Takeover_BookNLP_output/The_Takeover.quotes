1084	1105	1081	1081	I	0	“ Do n’t say an outright no — just keep him on ice in the background as an insurance policy . ”
1106	1115	1063	1065	A funny idiot	268	“ Yes , that ’s a great plan . ”

2362	2372	2356	2356	I	0	“ And do tell — what have you learned ? ”
2373	2382	2338	2338	his	280	“ You are letting staff go every month . ”

2662	2688	2651	2651	I	0	“ The last three years your company has run at a massive loss . You ’re losing advertising accounts left , right , and center . ”
2702	2712	2697	2697	he	284	“ I ’m guessing the financials are a nightmare . ”
2727	2746	2713	2713	I	0	“ I can take everything off your hands , and you can take a hard - earned break . ”
2755	2792	2793	2793	His	284	“ You would love that , would n’t you ? Play Mr. Nice Guy and take everything off my hands . . . come in on your horse and save the day like a white knight . ”

2912	2953	2904	2904	He	74	“ Claire , let ’s get one thing straight . I always get what I want . And what I want is Anderson Media . I can take it now from you for a good price that will protect you . Or”—he
2955	2980	2981	2981	He	74	casually—“I can wait for six months until the liquidators move in and get it for next to nothing , and you can face bankruptcy . ”
2993	3002	2983	2983	his	74	“ We both know the end is near . ”
3003	3010	3011	3011	I	0	“ You self - conceited prick , ”
3025	3033	3014	3014	He	74	“ Nice guys come last , Claire . ”
3045	3050	3051	3051	He	74	“ Think about it . ”
3071	3093	3094	3094	he	74	“ I know this is not how you want to sell your company . But you need to be a realist , ”
3126	3149	3121	3121	Our	289	“ Take the offer , Claire . I ’ll email you a figure this afternoon . You will be taken care of . ”

3214	3218	3193	3193	his	74	“ I do . ”
3219	3260	3261	3261	His	74	“ Then you ’ll know that this company was my husband ’s labor of love . He worked for ten years to build it up from the ground . His dream was to hand it down to his three sons . ”
3266	3275	3261	3261	His	74	“ So . . . do n’t you fucking dare”—I
3287	3323	3283	3283	my	0	tears—“sit there with that smug look on your face and threaten me . Because believe me . . . Mr. Miles , whatever you ’re dishing out is n’t half as bad as losing him . ”

3422	3432	3417	3417	Marley	77	“ Thanks for the cake — it was yummy . ”
3503	3526	3490	3490	She	77	“ Oh , screw this , Claire — let ’s not go back to work . Let ’s go get drunk instead . ”
3646	3717	3638	3638	her	81	“ So . . . do n’t you fucking dare sit there with that smug look on your face and threaten me . Because believe me . . . Mr. Miles , whatever you ’re dishing out is n’t half as bad as losing him . I ’ve already been to hell and back , and I will not have some rich , spoiled bastard make me feel like shit . ”

4047	4057	4035	4035	She	81	“ You ’re asking me out on a date ? ”
4064	4081	4082	4082	She	81	“ I do n’t like the way we met . I would like to start again . ”
4089	4113	4082	4082	She	81	“ You have got to be kidding . I would n’t go out with you if you were the last man on earth . ”
4118	4130	4115	4115	she	81	“ Money and looks do n’t impress me , Mr. Miles . ”
4141	4150	4115	4115	she	81	“ Our meeting was nothing personal , Claire . ”
4151	4187	4192	4192	she	81	“ It was very personal to me . Go and find a bimbo to wine and dine , Tristan . I have no interest in dating a cold , soul - sucking bastard like you . ”
4307	4319	4320	4320	Marley	77	“ I think this is going to be great for you , ”
4367	4406	4332	4332	she	297	“ Marley , I can tell you straight up , right now , that if you think a motivational conference with all those crazies is going to help me , you are more insane than I ever realized . ”
4407	4451	4452	4452	I	0	“ Stop it ; it ’s gon na be fantastic . You go away , regroup , and refocus , and you ’ll come back refreshed , and the company and your life and everything else is all going to fall into place . ”
4457	4476	4477	4477	she	297	“ Come on — can we at least agree that you need to change your mind - set ? ”
4487	4490	4477	4477	she	297	“ Possibly . ”
4496	4552	4491	4491	I	0	“ And it ’s not your fault you ’re flat . You ’ve been through so much : your husband ’s unexpected death , caring for three boys , and struggling to keep the company afloat . It ’s been hell . And realistically you ’ve been fighting since Wade ’s death five years ago . ”
4553	4568	4569	4569	I	0	“ Do you have to say it out loud ? Sounds even more depressing . ”
4581	4585	4586	4586	I	0	“ Come in , ”

4661	4677	4678	4678	I	0	“ My meeting finished early , and I ’m hungry . Let ’s go now . ”
4805	4819	4820	4820	Marley	77	“ Gabe , tell Claire that she needs to go to this conference . ”
4833	4849	4850	4850	he	86	“ All right . . . Claire , you need to go to this conference , ”
4854	4863	4850	4850	he	86	“ Now let ’s eat . Sushi awaits . ”
4870	4927	4864	4864	Marley	77	“ Can you just have a week off and go to Paris ? Take some time for yourself . Get away from the kids . I can look after everything back here at the office . We had that cash injection — things are okay around here for the moment . Use the time to recharge . ”
5062	5068	5069	5069	Marley	77	“ Go to the conference , ”
5073	5086	5069	5069	Marley	77	“ You are not going to lunch until you agree to this . ”
5087	5103	5104	5104	Gabriel	86	“ Hurry up , woman . Yes . It ’s agreed ; she ’s going . ”
5126	5141	5142	5142	I	0	“ You know I do n’t know how to do the motivational mumbo jumbo . ”
5151	5166	5142	5142	I	0	“ The crap that they go on with is next - level batshit crazy . ”
5167	5187	5188	5188	Marley	77	“ I think you need some batshit crazy , because batshit broke is n’t a fun place to visit . ”
5195	5200	5192	5192	I	0	“ This is true . ”
5245	5334	5232	5232	I	0	“ Go , recharge . It ’s in Épernay in the Champagne district of France , for fuck ’s sake . It does n’t get any more beautiful than this , Claire . It ’s a tax deduction ; you either pay for this or pay it in taxes — the choice is yours . At the very least , you can get a massage every afternoon and then drink two liters of champagne every night with your gourmet dinner and fall into bed in a blissful stupor . ”
5335	5340	5341	5341	Gabriel	86	“ Épernay is beautiful , ”
5346	5355	5341	5341	Gabriel	86	“ I would go just for the location . ”
5356	5362	5363	5363	I	0	“ You ’ve been there ? ”
5367	5379	5380	5380	he	86	“ A few times . I went with Sophia last summer , ”
5383	5389	5380	5380	he	86	“ She loves it there . ”
5416	5431	5462	5462	Marley	77	“ Now , a gourmet dinner and champagne . . . that is tempting . ”
5432	5461	5462	5462	Marley	77	“ If the conference part of the trip is boring , just ditch it , and have a week to yourself in France . You need this break , ”
5468	5482	5465	5465	Gabriel	86	“ Agreed . You ’re going . Hurry up ; I ’m ravenous . ”
5487	5495	5483	5483	I	0	“ Will you just go for me ? ”
5503	5506	5501	5501	hers	77	“ Please . ”
5533	5536	5537	5537	I	0	“ Fine . ”
5540	5545	5537	5537	I	0	“ I ’ll go . ”
5558	5578	5579	5579	She	77	“ Yes , this is going to be so good for you , Claire — just what you need . ”
5585	5599	5579	5579	She	77	“ I ’m going to book flights now before you change your mind . ”
5611	5618	5605	5605	I	0	“ I ’m already dreading it . ”
5619	5627	5628	5628	She	77	“ Eep , I ’m so excited . ”
5640	5644	5645	5645	Gabriel	86	“ We going ? ”

53775	53795	53770	53770	I	0	“ You call Tristan Miles back and tell him to stick his job where the sun does n’t shine . ”

54335	54339	54329	54329	He	96	“ I will . ”
54340	54354	54355	54355	I	0	“ Being smart in business does n’t mean you have to be cutthroat , ”
54359	54368	54355	54355	I	0	“ I know ; we talked about this . ”
54372	54389	54369	54369	He	96	“ Your father was such a good man , Fletch , with the highest of morals . ”

54465	54484	54437	54437	I	0	“ Because this is a big deal , and I do n’t want you to mess it up . ”
54485	54488	54489	54489	He	96	“ Mom . ”
54492	54524	54489	54489	He	96	“ I stuffed underpants in the boss ’s mouth before I even got the job . I ’m pretty sure I ’ve already messed it up as much as physically possible . ”
54535	54556	54525	54525	I	0	“ God , please do n’t remind me . That will forever be the most mortifying moment of my life . ”
54569	54573	54557	54557	I	0	“ Worked out . ”
54577	54583	54574	54574	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
54584	54592	54593	54593	He	96	“ Well , he never came back . ”
54596	54642	54593	54593	He	96	“ We were just friends , Fletcher . He was never coming back anyway . . . long before you did that . Do n’t flatter yourself . If he and I were actually a thing , do you really think that would deter him ? ”
54643	54646	54647	54647	He	96	“ Hmm . ”
54751	54758	54759	54759	I	0	“ Just remember to be professional , ”
54763	54767	54759	54759	I	0	“ I know . ”

54780	54793	54775	54775	He	96	“ And if you get into trouble , what do you do ? ”
54794	54808	54809	54809	He	96	“ Go to the bathroom , and count to ten to calm down . ”
54820	54827	54815	54815	I	0	“ That ’s it , Fletch . ”
54834	54842	54828	54828	I	0	“ You ’re going to be great . ”

54960	54965	54953	54953	I	0	“ Let ’s go . ”
54986	54998	54999	54999	I	0	“ It ’s one thirty p.m. Why has n’t he called ? ”
55002	55007	55008	55008	Marley	77	“ He probably forgot , ”
55011	55021	55022	55022	I	0	“ What if they did n’t give him lunch ? ”
55025	55037	55022	55022	I	0	“ He ca n’t handle not eating . He might faint . ”
55043	55071	55040	55040	her	77	“ It will be fine , and it is n’t a prison camp . Miles Media has one of the best reputations for treating their staff well . ”
55072	55086	55087	55087	I	0	“ Will you stop telling me that everything is going to be okay ? ”
55090	55108	55087	55087	I	0	“ Because I have a reason to be concerned , and I ’m really worried about him . ”
55109	55127	55040	55040	her	77	“ Oh my God , you ’re driving yourself crazy — and me , for that matter . ”
55128	55155	55040	55040	her	77	“ When you have a child who is going to work for the biggest bastard in the world , you let me know how you go . ”
55156	55161	55162	55162	She	1129	“ Okay , fine . ”
55167	55189	55162	55162	She	1129	“ This would n’t have anything to do with the fact that Mr. Miles has n’t called you , would it ? ”
55198	55287	55288	55288	Marley	77	“ What , as if I ’m annoyed that he has n’t call me ? I had already broken it off with him — not that we actually had anything to break off . It was just one week , Marley , and besides , Tristan Miles means nothing to me . But I have serious suspicions as to why he would ’ve hired Fletcher in the first place . Something feels off . Fletcher tried to bash him with his own underpants , for God ’s sake . ”
55291	55315	55288	55288	Marley	77	“ Oh Lord , how I wish I was there to see that . I bet Tristan Miles has never had that before . ”
55354	55375	55376	55376	I	0	“ I ’m just gon na text him . I ca n’t be going crazy like this for any longer . ”

55478	55491	55468	55468	I	0	“ What ’s happening over there ? I do n’t believe this . ”
55497	55518	55494	55494	her	77	“ I do , actually . Let ’s face it , Claire . Fletcher does n’t exactly take orders well . ”
55527	55535	55536	55536	Marley	77	“ Hopefully his afternoon will be better . ”
55539	55571	55536	55536	Marley	77	“ It will be . Do n’t you remember what it was like to start a new job ? Everybody ’s first day at a new job is bad , Claire . ”
55575	55582	55572	55572	I	0	“ I guess you ’re right . ”
55583	55612	55536	55536	Marley	77	“ Everything is going to be fine . Relax , and let him go . He ’s nearly a man . He needs to find his own way . ”
55613	55619	55620	55620	I	0	“ Yeah , I know . ”
55764	55775	55747	55747	I	0	“ How did it go at school today , Harry ? ”

55787	55794	55795	55795	He	1132	“ A witch , as usual . ”
55798	55815	55795	55795	He	1132	“ I do n’t think it ’s very nice to be calling your teacher a witch . ”
55816	55837	55747	55747	I	0	“ Yeah , well , if she stopped acting like one , I would n’t have to call her one . ”
55838	55878	55879	55879	Harry	141	“ Just stay out of trouble , please , Harry . You ’re on your last warning at that school . I need you to behave . You need to show everyone how smart and charming you really are . ”
55891	55923	55884	55884	Patrick	93	“ Now let ’s be nice when Fletch gets home . He ’s had a really bad day . And I want you boys to try and make him feel better . ”
55924	55934	55935	55935	Harry	141	“ And how are we supposed to do that ? ”
55942	55973	55974	55974	Harry	141	“ Just talk about things and take his mind off it . Make him laugh . Try and make him see that things are n’t as bad as he thinks . ”
55977	55995	55974	55974	Harry	141	“ I think they are as bad as he thinks . Imagine working with that pompous donkey . ”
55996	56004	56005	56005	I	0	“ You do n’t even know him , ”
56008	56036	56005	56005	I	0	“ You ca n’t say that ; he ’s a nice man . And he ’s Fletch ’s new boss , so you show him some respect . ”
56096	56104	56090	56090	I	0	“ How is my big working boy ? ”
56105	56111	56112	56112	My	0	“ It was literal hell . ”
56116	56122	56112	56112	My	0	“ Why ? What happened ? ”
56123	56132	56090	56090	I	0	“ Basically , I ruined everything I touched . ”
56133	56160	56161	56161	I	0	“ That ’s okay . You ’re only new ; they ca n’t expect you to know everything . Nobody knows everything on the first day . ”
56168	56180	56161	56161	I	0	“ What was the last thing that he said to you ? ”
56181	56190	56191	56191	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare be late tomorrow . ”
56194	56207	56191	56191	I	0	“ Did n’t he say ‘ Thanks for your first day ’ ? ”
56208	56221	56090	56090	I	0	“ No , Mom . I told you he ’s an asshole . ”
56222	56235	56161	56161	I	0	“ Hmm . Well , let ’s just see how tomorrow goes . ”
56236	56243	56191	56191	I	0	“ I ’m not going back . ”
56244	56252	56253	56253	I	0	“ Yes , you are , Fletcher , ”
56256	56302	56253	56253	I	0	“ You ’re going to work two weeks there . I will not have you embarrassing me . If you do n’t like it after two weeks , you can stop , but you will ride it out and at least give it a chance . ”
56325	56331	56314	56314	I	0	“ I made your favorite . ”
56332	56341	56342	56342	I	0	“ I ’m too tired to eat it . ”

56724	56736	56688	56688	He	96	“ I ’m just not very good at it , Mom . ”
56737	56756	56757	56757	He	96	“ Honey , you ’re not supposed to be very good at it . You ’re just new . ”
56770	56776	56757	56757	He	96	“ What ’s Tristan like ? ”
56780	56783	56757	56757	He	96	“ Mean . ”

56936	56959	56960	56960	I	0	“ There were n’t any other pens there , so I just sat and listened to him talk along with everyone else . ”
56966	57015	56960	56960	I	0	“ Halfway through the meeting he noticed I was n’t taking notes and asked why . I told him I left my pen behind , and he completely lost his shit , screamed at me in front of everyone , and kicked me out of the management meeting . ”
57016	57025	57026	57026	I	0	“ What ? He was screaming at you ? ”
57029	57067	57026	57026	I	0	“ Like a madman . Saying that he wo n’t put up with my laziness or sloppiness , and if I have no desire to learn , then I may as well leave Miles Media right now . ”

57156	57187	57188	57188	He	1147	“ And Jameson Miles is known for screaming at everyone all the time , Mom , so I know Tristan must n’t scream at anyone else like he does me . ”

57454	57497	57362	57362	I	0	“ God , I ’m going crazy over this . What if he just hired him to put him through hell for the way they met ? What if he ’s purposely being nasty to teach me a lesson for ending it ? ”
57498	57504	57505	57505	She	1148	“ It ’s completely possible . ”
57509	57528	57505	57505	She	1148	“ But this job will set Fletch up for life , so more fool him , you know ? ”
57529	57547	57362	57362	I	0	“ But at what point is it enough ? Like how far do I let it go ? ”

58880	58892	58893	58893	I	0	“ Why on earth would he respect a jerk like you ? ”
58897	58916	58917	58917	he	96	“ Because I ’m his boss , Claire , and I am not putting up with his excuses , ”

58930	58990	58927	58927	I	0	“ I did not call him stupid . I told him to stop acting stupid . There ’s a big difference . He ’s intelligent , Claire , a lot more than you give him credit for . He does n’t have anger issues ; he has a fucking attitude issue , and I ’m getting rid of it . ”
58991	58999	59000	59000	I	0	“ By making a fool of him ? ”
59003	59040	59000	59000	I	0	“ By making him learn from his mistakes . If he is not punished as he does them , he will keep doing it . You do n’t learn a lesson unless it makes you uncomfortable . ”

59342	59359	59360	59360	Tristan	74	“ Do you want to know why I ’m riding this kid so hard , Claire ? ”
59368	59390	59363	59363	I	0	“ Because Fletcher Anderson has more potential than I ’ve seen in a very long time . He ’s super intelligent . ”
59402	59419	59420	59420	he	74	“ But he ’s also a little shit , and he ’s lazy and lacks discipline , ”
59430	59519	59423	59423	I	0	“ I can give him the tools that he needs , but they do n’t come easy . There are no shortcuts to this , Claire . I ’m the only person who can give him the tool kit . So do n’t you barge in here and ruin everything for him . You are killing this kid with kindness , Claire . He ’s not a child . He ’s a man . He needs to grow the fuck up and take responsibility for his own shortcomings . ”
59525	59537	59538	59538	he	96	“ Why the hell are you still standing here , Fletcher ? ”
59541	59548	59538	59538	he	96	“ Go and finish the report . ”
59549	59557	59558	59558	Fletcher	96	“ See you at home , Mom , ”

62359	62366	62367	62367	Gabriel	86	“ You mean at her desk , ”
62379	62386	62370	62370	Tristan	74	“ I know what I meant . ”

62646	62660	62641	62641	I	0	“ I do n’t want to see you because you ’re a coward . ”
62661	62669	62641	62641	I	0	“ How the fuck am I coward ? ”

62971	62991	62962	62962	His	1251	“ It would n’t bother you that I did n’t like your children if you did n’t want me . ”

63996	64050	63992	63992	I	0	“ It ’s only twelve months , and I know that it is n’t ideal , but it will be good for him to get out of his comfort zone . And besides , he ’s giving them a run for their money , so he might not even last without being fired . ”
64051	64059	64116	64116	I	0	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
64060	64070	63992	63992	I	0	“ Because I knew you would react like this . ”

64702	64712	64713	64713	I	0	“ What if I really was here with Gabriel ? ”
64716	64726	64713	64713	I	0	“ Then I ’m about to steal his girl . ”
64746	64750	64751	64751	I	0	“ Stop it , ”

98965	98993	98961	98961	He	74	“ Yeah , well , it ’s a bit awkward for poor Mom to be in the middle . You probably should start cutting ties with her . ”

99976	99988	99989	99989	he	1781	“ Is this a Saturday morning or a Spanish fucking Inquisition ? ”
99996	100016	99989	99989	he	1781	“ I want to get to know you . I ’m going to ask you questions all day long . ”

100209	100216	100217	100217	I	0	“ It ’s okay , Tris , ”
100220	100238	100217	100217	I	0	“ I ’ve only ever murdered two men in their sleep before . You ’re completely safe . ”
100244	100261	100239	100239	He	1781	“ The fact that that even crosses your mind to say is somewhat concerning , Claire . ”

101061	101100	101058	101058	He	277	“ I used to . Mainly only now when my brother Elliot is in town . Nocello is one of our favorite restaurants in Manhattan . I used to be here a lot more than I am now . ”
101107	101114	101105	101105	him	277	“ You ’re close to Elliot ? ”
101115	101127	101105	101105	him	277	“ Yeah , he ’s in town this weekend , actually . ”
101128	101132	101133	101133	I	0	“ He is ? ”
101138	101173	101133	101133	I	0	“ He and Christopher have flown in for an art auction that ’s on tomorrow night . I was going to talk to you about it , actually . Do you want to go ? ”
101178	101190	101133	101133	I	0	“ They flew in from London just for an art auction ? ”
101191	101194	101195	101195	he	277	“ Yeah , ”
101199	101233	101195	101195	he	277	“ They fly around the world for art auctions . Elliot is into collecting art . He has a very impressive portfolio , actually . He started collecting back when we were kids . ”
101234	101247	101248	101248	I	0	“ How do you start collecting art when you are a kid ? ”
101298	101301	101302	101302	He	74	“ Hmm . ”
101307	101315	101316	101317	The waiter	277	“ That ’s lovely . Thank you . ”

101379	101400	101372	101372	I	0	“ Carry on with your story . How in the hell does someone begin to collect art as a child ? ”
101401	101404	101405	101405	He	74	“ Oh . ”
101412	101437	101405	101405	He	74	“ He bought a picture from a yard sale with his allowance when he was fourteen , and it ended up being very valuable . ”
101442	101479	101438	101438	I	0	“ Back in college , he would go to the art facility and buy paintings from the art students . He still has them all in storage . He has a real eye for evolving talent . ”
101494	101498	101499	101499	I	0	“ And Christopher ? ”
101502	101509	101499	101499	I	0	“ He ’s into art too ? ”
101510	101536	101537	101537	I	0	“ No , he ’s just Elliot ’s art wingman . He likes the thrill of the auctions . It ’s a game to him . ”
101552	101562	101543	101543	I	0	“ This auction tomorrow night is a big one . ”
101563	101568	101569	101569	I	0	“ Why is that ? ”
101572	101591	101569	101569	I	0	“ Elliot is obsessed with this artist , has all her paintings that have gone up for auction . ”
101592	101597	101543	101543	I	0	“ Who is she ? ”
101598	101638	101639	101639	I	0	“ We have no idea ; her name is Harriet Boucher . She ’s an older recluse , apparently . We have searched and searched for this woman . She ’s been the topic of many a drinking session . ”
101650	101660	101661	101661	He	1824	“ And you think I ’m a weird person . ”
101668	101679	101661	101661	He	1824	“ I suppose it does seem weird from the outside . ”
101680	101686	101687	101687	I	0	“ So how . . . ”
101703	101707	101687	101687	I	0	“ How what ? ”
101708	101724	101725	101725	I	0	“ How was it decided what each of you boys would do in the company ? ”
101728	101740	101725	101725	I	0	“ Like how were the positions given to each of you ? ”
101752	101766	101741	101741	He	1824	“ I guess it was based on what we are individually good at . ”
101770	101783	101784	101784	His	1824	“ Jameson is good at control . He is very . . . ”
101789	101797	101784	101784	His	1824	“ You will meet him next weekend . ”
101798	101801	101802	101802	I	0	“ When ? ”
101816	101834	101835	101835	I	0	“ We have an industry cocktail party . I want you to come and meet my family . ”
101837	101840	101841	101841	I	0	“ Great , ”
101887	101907	101908	101908	I	0	“ Elliot is into the graphics of the company . He oversees the visual representation of all things Miles . ”
101911	101927	101908	101908	I	0	“ Christopher manages human resources . He likes people . Managing staff is his thing . ”
101928	101932	101933	101933	I	0	“ And you ? ”
101936	101941	101933	101933	I	0	“ What about me ? ”
101942	101952	101953	101953	He	1826	“ How did you get to do the acquisitions ? ”
101959	101970	101953	101953	He	1826	“ I ’m good at numbers and taking calculated risks . ”
101976	101980	101971	101971	I	0	“ Meaning what ? ”
101981	102014	101933	101933	I	0	“ Well , I can look at a company and its figures and do a due diligence report , and from that I know whether the company is worth anything moving forward . ”
102015	102043	102044	102044	He	1826	“ You know , now that I know you , I ca n’t imagine you — and do n’t take this the wrong way — destroying companies . ”
102143	102168	102137	102137	I	0	“ You know , Tris , out of all the people I have met in my life , you have been the biggest surprise . ”
102169	102174	102137	102137	I	0	“ Why is that ? ”
102175	102187	102137	102137	I	0	“ You ’re not at all who I thought you were . ”
102188	102196	102137	102137	I	0	“ Who did you think I was ? ”
102205	102215	102197	102197	I	0	“ Somebody that I could never have feelings for . ”
102222	102230	102231	102231	He	1826	“ What are those feelings , Claire ? ”
102241	102260	102231	102231	He	1826	“ You keep hinting at these feelings , but you have n’t told me what they actually are . ”
102375	102383	102384	102384	I	0	“ You know , Tris . . . ”
102387	102424	102384	102384	I	0	“ I do n’t want to sound insecure , because I ’m not . I ’m more than happy with who I am . But I do wonder what you see when you look at me . ”

102461	102476	102458	102458	I	0	“ I do n’t see anything . . . it ’s how I feel . ”

102559	102566	102567	102567	He	1826	“ It ’s like . . . ”
102570	102594	102567	102567	He	1826	“ It ’s like I ’ve gone back to being a teenager , and you ’re reprogramming everything I thought I ever knew . ”
102595	102602	102603	102603	I	0	“ Is that a bad thing ? ”
102608	102617	102603	102603	I	0	“ I do n’t want to reprogram you . ”
102618	102621	102622	102622	He	1826	“ No . ”
102625	102651	102622	102622	He	1826	“ Wrong choice of words . I mean , you ’re showing me what I want as opposed to what I was supposed to want . ”
102652	102658	102603	102603	I	0	“ You mean my kids ? ”
102659	102662	102603	102603	I	0	“ No , ”

102717	102728	102708	102708	him	1826	“ You put everyone ’s needs before yourself , Claire . ”
102733	102753	102708	102708	him	1826	“ And for the first time in my life , you make me want to put someone before me . ”

107073	107087	107088	107088	Tristan	74	“ This is not a sardine car ; it ’s an Aston Martin , ”
107094	107116	107088	107088	Tristan	74	“ Nothing fishy about it , although I can always arrange a seat in the trunk , if you would prefer . ”

107359	107379	107380	107380	he	141	“ There are four Andersons and only one Miles . It ’s hardly a Miles booking , is it ? ”
107408	107415	107416	107416	I	0	“ That ’s enough , Harry , ”

107628	107631	107632	107632	Tristan	74	“ Yes , ”
107637	107659	107632	107632	Tristan	74	“ Like on a date . I would like to be your boyfriend , Claire Anderson . What do you say ? ”

107790	107810	107787	107787	Tristan	74	“ Someone to go to the movies and out to dinner with . A boyfriend , if you will . ”
107823	107835	107836	107836	he	284	“ And as I see it , you have four choices , ”

107886	107901	107902	107902	He	284	“ However , that would mean that you all have to move to France . ”
107911	107936	107902	107902	He	284	“ And of course , Muff Cat and Woofy ca n’t move to Paris , so they would have to move in with me . ”
107945	107953	107954	107954	Harry	141	“ I am not moving to Paris , ”
107960	107964	107965	107965	Fletcher	96	“ Me neither , ”

108027	108047	108023	108023	Harry	141	“ You can forget about it . I ’m calling Grandma ; she wo n’t like this at all . ”
108048	108055	108056	108056	I	0	“ What are the other choices ? ”
108063	108072	108073	108073	he	141	“ You could go out with Pilates Paul , ”
108076	108083	108073	108073	he	141	“ Oh , he ’s nice . ”
108088	108097	108084	108084	I	0	“ I do like him . Great choice . ”

108164	108181	108161	108161	Fletcher	96	“ That ’s just embarrassing . He wears a pink sweatband around his head to Pilates . ”
108182	108185	108186	108186	Tristan	74	“ Yes , ”
108189	108205	108186	108186	Tristan	74	“ Exactly my point , Fletch . He will bring the Anderson name into disrepute . ”
108206	108213	108215	108215	Patrick	93	“ He is weird , Mom , ”
108217	108224	108215	108215	Patrick	93	“ You have to admit it . ”
108232	108241	108225	108225	I	0	“ Okay , what is my other choice ? ”
108242	108252	108253	108253	I	0	“ You could meet someone new who has kids . ”
108268	108307	108262	108262	he	74	“ But whenever he comes over , he will bring his children , and they will have to have a bedroom to stay in . So Harry and Patrick will have to share a bedroom from now on . ”
108323	108332	108333	108333	he	74	“ Why does Fletcher get his own room ? ”
108346	108365	108366	108366	He	74	“ Because Fletcher is an adult , and he needs his own room . But then . . . ”
108377	108393	108366	108366	He	74	“ Those other kids will use a lot of internet , maybe all the data . ”
108411	108445	108407	108407	he	74	“ They ’ll also eat all of the food , and they wo n’t have a skateboard or bike at your house , so you will have to share all of your things . ”
108457	108466	108407	108407	he	74	“ That ’s if they are n’t girls . ”
108467	108470	108471	108471	Harry	141	“ Girls ? ”
108480	108500	108501	108501	he	141	“ No way . You are not going out with anyone with kids , Mom . I forbid it , ”
108507	108510	108501	108501	he	141	“ Oh . ”
108518	108531	108514	108514	I	0	“ I kind of liked the idea of having more kids around . ”

108586	108596	108597	108597	he	141	“ That ’s a very good question , Claire , ”
108613	108623	108600	108600	he	141	“ I have prepared a list of my attributes . ”
108653	108659	108636	108636	He	141	“ I ’m good looking . ”

108738	108746	108747	108747	Harry	141	“ I ’m not doing that anyway , ”
108752	108761	108747	108747	Harry	141	“ Do n’t get any ideas , Mom . ”
108762	108770	108771	108771	he	74	“ I ’m getting a bigger car , ”
108774	108778	108771	108771	he	74	“ You are ? ”
108791	108802	108803	108803	He	74	“ Show me where it says that on the list . ”
108812	108827	108828	108828	I	0	“ That was a recently added point , Claire . Do n’t interrupt me . ”

108862	108868	108869	108869	Harry	141	“ You are not fun , ”
108872	108877	108869	108869	Harry	141	“ You ’re boring . ”
108886	108900	108878	108878	Tristan	74	“ How am I boring ? Name one time I have been boring . ”
108901	108909	108910	108910	Harry	141	“ Right now . This is boring , ”

135806	135826	135794	135794	She	2396	“ That wo n’t be possible . You need to book a meeting at least two weeks in advance . ”
135827	135831	135832	135832	Tristan	74	“ All right . ”
135837	135855	135832	135832	Tristan	74	“ I would like you to get the board of education on the phone for me immediately . ”

135998	136003	136004	136004	she	2396	“ Just a minute , ”

136256	136263	136264	136264	Tristan	74	“ Take a seat , please . ”
136271	136283	136264	136264	Tristan	74	“ You will need to stay and take minutes , please . ”

136409	136431	136432	136432	He	2399	“ I would like to discuss the education of Harrison and , in particular , the grading system of his work . ”
136444	136458	136432	136432	He	2399	“ He got a thirty on this . Please explain to me why . ”
136463	136470	136459	136460	Mrs. Henderson	214	“ It was n’t any good . ”
136478	136483	136471	136471	Tristan	74	“ In whose opinion ? ”
136484	136497	136498	136498	Tristan	74	“ Mine , and as his teacher , what I say goes . ”
136516	136521	136522	136522	He	2399	“ Is that so ? ”
136525	136534	136522	136522	He	2399	“ I would like this assignment independently graded . ”
136535	136552	136471	136471	Tristan	74	“ No , that ’s not possible , and why would you want to do that ? ”
136553	136571	136522	136522	He	2399	“ Because Harrison Anderson is being victimized by you because you have a personality clash with him . ”
136572	136576	136577	136578	Mrs. Henderson	214	“ Oh please , ”
136581	136596	136577	136578	Mrs. Henderson	214	“ I try and teach him , but there is nothing in his head . ”
136608	136614	136615	136615	He	74	“ And there it is . ”
136621	136627	136628	136629	The receptionist	2396	“ Did you get that ? ”
136633	136645	136628	136629	The receptionist	2396	“ You ’ve just signed your termination letter , Mrs. Henderson . ”
136655	136689	136650	136650	She	214	“ I ’ve personally checked this assignment , and it is not a thirty — perhaps an eighty at worst . You grade him low on every test on some personal power trip . ”
136690	136697	136698	136698	she	214	“ Oh , that is rubbish , ”
136710	136730	136701	136701	Tristan	74	“ I have every single test of Harrison ’s right here , and I would like an independent grader . ”
136731	136742	136650	136650	She	214	“ He ’s rude , and he needs to repeat . ”
136743	136768	136650	136650	She	214	“ He ’s gifted and tired of being discriminated against . Tell me , Mrs. Henderson , have you ever had his IQ tested ? ”
136769	136776	136701	136701	Tristan	74	“ No . . . but — ”
136777	136814	136650	136650	She	214	“ Do you think it ’s possible that you are intimidated by this child , and you purposely try and get him sent out of class so that he does n’t activate your own inferiority complex ? ”
136815	136822	136823	136824	Mrs. Smithers	217	“ Oh , that ’s ridiculous , ”
136827	136836	136823	136824	Mrs. Smithers	217	“ You are very rude , Mr. Miles . ”
136844	136867	136837	136837	Tristan	74	“ On another topic , Mrs. Smithers , I would like a report on what you are doing to help Patrick Anderson . ”
136872	136876	136868	136868	Her	217	“ For what ? ”
136877	136901	136839	136839	his	74	“ He has dyslexia , and under state law your school receives special funding for extra help for him . Where is it ? ”
136908	136923	136924	136925	Mrs. Smithers	217	“ I do n’t appreciate you coming in here and slinging your accusations around , ”
136933	136941	136928	136928	Tristan	74	“ And I do n’t appreciate incompetence . ”
136945	136960	136961	136961	He	74	“ You will be hearing from the education board with regard to this matter . ”
136967	136981	136961	136961	He	74	“ Harrison wo n’t be back . Nor Patrick , for that matter . ”
136990	137000	137001	137002	Mrs. Henderson	214	“ And where are you going to send him ? ”
137006	137014	137001	137002	Mrs. Henderson	214	“ They ’ll be attending Trinity School . ”
137015	137018	137019	137020	Mrs. Smithers	217	“ Ha , ”
137023	137041	137019	137020	Mrs. Smithers	217	“ He wo n’t get in there . They wo n’t take him with his behavior record . ”
137042	137047	137048	137048	He	74	“ We ’ll see . ”
137061	137071	137072	137072	He	74	“ You know , intelligent people scare stupid people . ”
137080	137086	137087	137087	She	522	“ Did you get that ? ”
137092	137100	137087	137087	She	522	“ What does that supposed to mean ? ”
137105	137113	137114	137114	Tristan	74	“ What is that supposed to mean , ”
137118	137130	137131	137131	He	74	“ Let ’s go ; we are wasting our time here . ”
