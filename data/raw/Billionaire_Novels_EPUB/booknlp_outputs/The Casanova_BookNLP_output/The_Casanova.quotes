And I do n’t know how long I ’ll keep doing it , maybe not forever , maybe not much more at all . But whenever I do it , I do n’t regret it . It does n’t feel wrong , if that ’s what you mean . ”

4850	4890	4891	4891	Daniel	71	“ Well , you said that you have n’t slept with many men . If that ’s a low number for you what ’s a high number ? I mean . . . what are your numbers for women ? ”
4894	4921	4891	4891	Daniel	71	“ Too many to count , I ’m afraid . I meet some beautiful people in my industry , sometimes the temptation is just too great . ”

5060	5086	5050	5050	Daniel	71	“ I mean , I have in the past . I guess I just got out of the swing of it as I got older . ”

5097	5135	5094	5094	he	71	“ Twenty - seven . I had a few boyfriends in high school and college , and then after that I had a long - term boyfriend . We broke up a year after my parents died . ”

5445	5504	5441	5441	I	0	“ She ’s not so bad . She ’s taken our parents ’ death the hardest and somehow her personality changed overnight . Brad and I have held each other up and limped along and yet , all she wanted to do is be on her own . She has n’t handled grief the same as we have . ”

41359	41388	41344	41344	Elliot	74	“ What we did n’t realize was , that when we added the new WAP code it was going to completely override the system for the entire building . ”
41389	41397	41398	41398	Elliot	74	“ Why did n’t you realize that ? ”
41407	41431	41404	41404	Joel	124	“ Is n’t it what I pay you for ? An IT expert to stop an impending disaster before it comes to fruition . ”
41459	41480	41452	41452	I	0	“ Do n’t look at Kathryn , look at me . Who specifically out of you three uploaded the system ? ”

41683	41701	41702	41702	he	74	“ Let ’s multiply that by the three hours that I did n’t have any goddamn internet , ”
41710	41730	41707	41707	his	123	“ That ’s two hundred and twenty - four thousand and seven hundred pounds your incompetence has cost me . ”
41737	41749	41750	41750	He	74	“ Would you like me to deduct that from your salary ? ”

41863	41896	41851	41851	his	74	“ Oh , you ’d like that , would n’t you ? Run away from your incompetence instead of facing the music . I do n’t know why I would expect better . ”
41902	41911	41912	41912	he	74	“ Do not roll your eyes at me , ”
41938	41951	41924	41924	Christopher	63	“ Elliot , can I see you for a moment , please ? ”

42010	42014	42007	42007	Bob	123	“ Screw this , ”
42019	42039	42007	42007	Bob	123	“ I ’m sick of his shit , he ’s a fucking asshole . I ’m out of here . ”
42040	42060	42061	42061	Joel	124	“ Calm down , he ’s been like this for years . Why is it suddenly bothering you now ? ”
42075	42088	42089	42089	Bob	123	“ I do n’t know why he ’s going on and on , ”
42092	42103	42089	42089	Bob	123	“ He makes two hundred thousand pounds every ten minutes . ”
42159	42173	42154	42154	he	74	“ This is not to happen again , do I make myself clear ? ”
42174	42177	42154	42154	he	74	“ Yes , ”
42184	42201	42202	42202	He	74	“ I ’m disappointed . When I pay for the best , I expect the best . ”

42390	42397	42386	42386	he	74	“ It was n’t a threat . ”
42398	42414	42433	42433	His	74	“ I keep my professional and private lives separate , I thought you could too . ”

42438	42470	42433	42433	His	74	“ That ’s a lie . You ’ve never threatened to leave before . In fact , you have stayed to spite me . Suddenly today , you want to resign ? ”
42471	42490	42537	42537	He	74	“ Nobody gets to speak to me like that , whether I ’m sleeping with them or not . ”
42491	42502	42503	42503	He	74	“ We have n’t slept together . . . yet . ”
42508	42519	42503	42503	He	74	“ Although , I ’m rectifying that situation very soon . ”

42656	42697	42698	42698	He	74	“ You know , for an intelligent man , you ’re pretty stupid . If you think you roasting me and my work colleagues over an honest mistake is a turn - on , you ’ve got another thing coming . ”
42711	42748	42698	42698	He	74	“ I ’m a professional , Kathryn . I would n’t be who I am if I was n’t . Incompetents wo n’t be tolerated , I do n’t care what my relationship with them is . ”
42762	42776	42749	42749	I	0	“ Do you want preferential treatment — is that what you ’re saying ? ”
42777	42784	42785	42785	I	0	“ No , of course not , ”
42788	42812	42785	42785	I	0	“ Then look at it from my angle , do you want to be treated the same at work or do n’t you ? ”
42825	42832	42833	42833	he	74	“ I can separate the two , ”
42836	42849	42833	42833	he	74	“ The Kathryn I work with and the Kate that I want . ”
42873	42881	42882	42882	he	74	“ Now let ’s talk about Kate , ”
42885	42890	42882	42882	he	74	“ I like her . ”
42920	42925	42913	42913	I	0	“ Let ’s not . ”

45393	45435	45436	45436	I	0	“ Because as soon as I openly date someone , it ’s all over the tabloids and whoever I ’m seeing gets hounded by the press over the impending nuptials . Everything we do is scrutinized and splashed over every headline . ”
45439	45452	45453	45453	he	989	“ Do you know how much pressure that puts on a relationship ? ”
45456	45462	45453	45453	he	989	“ I ca n’t imagine . ”

88919	88958	88913	88913	Frederick	164	” He kisses Siena and then turns to the redhead ; his hand drops to her behind as he kisses her and I know from his body language that she ’s his favorite . They turn to me . “

88968	89121	88913	88913	Frederick	164	” I fake a smile . Fuck off already . I want to go . Christopher walks them to the door and I hear the soft giggles of the girls as they say their goodbyes . Not so long ago , this was me : how did this life ever captivate me for so long ? I ’m way past stupid women ; womanizing just does n’t excite me anymore . I know it was fun at the time , but looking back it ’s all a blur . Not one of them ever stood out . Not like her . I get a vision of Kate last night on top of me , the way she looked down at me as she rode me . . . the sheen on her skin , the arousal in her eyes . . . a tingle runs through my body at the mere memory . “
89127	89146	88913	88913	Frederick	164	” Christopher mutters as he walks back into the room . I look up , my fantasy interrupted . “

89204	89212	89197	89197	I	0	” he says . All seems silent . “
89215	89223	89197	89197	I	0	” I open the car door slowly . “
89235	89255	89226	89226	they	1650	” Christopher says as he climbs out of the car . I look around , the coast seems clear . “
89270	89298	89256	89258	My old fella	1652	” Christopher and I stand on the edge of the gravel driveway . We go around the side of the house and look down toward the lake . “
89306	89322	89323	89323	I	0	” he asks . My eyes roam around the lake , and over the paddocks . “
89330	89345	89323	89323	I	0	” We both turn in a full circle as we search . Completely peaceful . “
89353	89368	89346	89346	I	0	” he repeats . With hands on his hips he looks over the valley . “
89375	89379	89323	89323	I	0	” he calls . “

89418	89432	89390	89390	your	0	” He narrows his eyes as he focuses on something in the distance . “
89438	89450	89323	89323	I	0	” I walk over and look to where his gaze is . “
89458	89527	89323	89323	I	0	” I fall silent . There ’s a huge , black sheep , but it ’s a different kind of sheep , with curly , round horns . We watch as it walks backward , takes a hard run - up and then head - butts the fence post as hard as it can . We hear the bang as it connects ; the sound echoes for miles . “
89534	89538	89539	89539	I	0	” I whisper . “
89544	89563	89539	89539	I	0	” Christopher frowns as he watches it run back and smash its head as hard as it can . “

89582	89625	89539	89539	I	0	” I whisper . Suddenly we hear squawks from behind us , and we turn to see the ducks running toward us up the hill , full throttle . Their wings are in the air , beaks open and ready to attack . “
89628	89642	89539	89539	I	0	” I cry as I take off in the direction of the house . “
89647	89679	89539	89539	I	0	” Christopher cries . I grab the keys from my pocket , the sound of angry ducks coming up close . I look down at the keys on the overcrowded keyring . “

89687	89696	89539	89539	I	0	” Christopher cries as he runs alongside me . “

89732	89757	89758	89758	You	0	” We dive into the car and jump in and slam the doors behind us . The ducks all squawk as they circle us . “
89763	89778	89758	89758	You	0	” Christopher pants as he holds his chest , looking down at our attackers . “
89785	89791	89792	89792	We	1657	” I start the car . “
89800	89861	89792	89792	We	1657	” We eat lunch , drink some beer , and devise a plan . Two hours later we head back up the driveway . I glance over to see the trusty shovel we bought sitting perfectly on the backseat . I park the car and hand the house keys to Chris . He frowns as he looks through the keys . “

89946	89947	89931	89931	I	0	” “
89950	89964	89931	89931	I	0	” He goes to get out of the car and then turns back . “

89976	90016	89931	89931	I	0	” I whisper . We all but tiptoe up to the porch , and Christopher quietly begins to try the keys , while I stand with my back to him , shovel in hand . Waiting for the attack . “
90020	90021	89931	89931	I	0	” “
90032	90048	90024	90024	you	0	” he whispers as he fiddles with the lock . I grip my shovel hard . “

90209	90218	90267	90267	he	1663	” I look up at Christopher in shock . “

114991	114996	114997	114997	Christopher	63	“ Found another one , ”
115011	115025	115026	115026	He	74	“ Do n’t mind them , dear , small things amuse small minds . ”
115032	115047	115048	115048	Elizabeth	115	“ So , this is the girl you brought home for me to meet ? ”

115065	115093	115062	115062	Nerves	195	“ Do n’t mind this morning , my dear , I ’m well equipped . I have brought up four very unruly boys , you must remember . ”
115102	115111	115112	115112	she	115	“ What are you doing today , Kate ? ”
115115	115125	115112	115112	she	115	“ I ’d like to take you to lunch . ”

115143	115148	115149	115149	she	115	“ Nonsense , Elliot , ”
115154	115179	115149	115149	she	115	“ When you called ahead and told me you had someone you wanted me to meet , I assumed she was from New York . ”
115190	115214	115215	115215	Her	115	“ But now that I know I only have limited time to get to know her , I ’m taking Kate to lunch . ”
115221	115232	115215	115215	Her	115	“ That ’s if she wants to , of course . ”

115472	115492	115469	115469	Elliot	74	“ Why the hell would you bring them here ? What kind of fucking stitch - up is that ? ”
115513	115524	115525	115525	He	2081	“ That was the best thing I ’ve ever seen . ”

115629	115640	115641	115641	Tristan	82	“ Perhaps it ’s the hard surfaces that she likes , ”
115680	115688	115689	115689	Elliot	74	“ Will you just all fuck off , ”
115692	115702	115703	115703	He	74	“ I ’ve got gray hair after this morning . ”
115714	115724	115725	115725	Jameson	81	“ Your face though when Mom said happy birthday , ”
115826	115831	115820	115820	Elliot	74	“ Hello Mr. Miles . ”

115870	115885	115850	115850	I	0	“ My mother wants to get you alone so she can dig for information . ”
115886	115890	115820	115820	Elliot	74	“ Like what ? ”
115891	115896	115820	115820	Elliot	74	“ She ’s nosy . ”

115905	115912	115820	115820	Elliot	74	“ Nothing . Tell her nothing . ”
115917	115925	115820	115820	Elliot	74	“ What if she asks me questions ? ”
115926	115939	115850	115850	I	0	“ Oh , she will . Do n’t you worry about that . ”
115940	115947	115850	115850	I	0	“ How will I answer them ? ”
115948	115953	115954	115954	I	0	“ Just be evasive . ”

116019	116028	115972	115972	He	2086	“ What if she does n’t like me ? ”
116029	116039	116040	116040	I	0	“ It does n’t matter , I like you . ”
116051	116058	116059	116059	he	2086	“ Does that count for something ? ”
116062	116066	116059	116059	he	2086	“ It does . ”
116067	116082	115972	115972	He	2086	“ After you finish lunch with her , come and see me at work . ”
116083	116086	116087	116087	I	0	“ Really ? ”

116139	116148	116149	116149	he	2086	“ Do n’t drink too much at lunch , ”
116156	116165	116153	116153	I	0	“ I mean it , she hates drunks . ”

116488	116492	116484	116484	she	115	“ Hello Kate . ”
116538	116541	116566	116566	She	115	“ Hi . ”

116678	116687	116675	116675	Elizabeth	115	“ Would you like some wine , Kathryn ? ”
116688	116701	116702	116702	I	0	“ No , thank you , I do n’t drink that often , ”

116750	116767	116742	116742	she	115	“ I can see why Elliot is so swept away with you , you ’re lovely . ”
116772	116777	116768	116768	I	0	“ Ah . . . ”
116790	116803	116783	116783	she	115	“ Has Elliot warned you not to elaborate on anything to me ? ”

116815	116823	116783	116783	she	115	“ He ’s a very private person . ”

116841	116865	116836	116836	She	115	“ I ’m afraid that out of all my children , growing up in the spotlight has had the biggest effect on Elliot . ”
116872	116893	116866	116866	I	0	“ He guards his privacy with his life and I ’m quite sure that some days he despises his surname . ”
116894	116900	116866	116866	I	0	“ I do n’t think — ”
116901	116906	116907	116907	She	115	“ Now , now . ”
116912	116932	116907	116907	She	115	“ There ’s no need to make excuses , my dear . I understand where he ’s coming from . ”
116933	116940	116941	116941	I	0	“ Where is he coming from ? ”
116944	116950	116951	116951	she	115	“ Elliot is a dreamer , ”
116954	116979	116951	116951	she	115	“ He lives in a world where he is forced to be a realist , but in his heart , he is a romantic . ”
116993	116999	116991	116991	Ed	100	“ Yes , I know . ”
117000	117033	116983	116983	I	0	“ When he called me last week and told me that he was bringing a plus - one to his birthday dinner , I knew that you must be special to him . ”
117034	117039	116991	116991	Ed	100	“ Why is that ? ”
117040	117043	117044	117044	She	2098	“ Darling . ”
117052	117066	117044	117044	She	2098	“ You ’re the first woman he ’s ever brought home to us . ”

117095	117103	117088	117088	She	2098	“ Hang in there , my dear . ”
117109	117124	117104	117104	She	2098	“ Once Elliot commits to a woman , she would be his entire world . ”
117158	117180	117156	117156	her	2100	“ It ’s only early days , he does n’t even want anyone to know that we ’re seeing each other . ”
117181	117190	117191	117191	she	2098	“ It has nothing to do with you , ”
117194	117242	117191	117191	she	2098	“ Elliot hates press , he hates the invasion of his privacy . When they nicknamed him Casanova Miles he was mortified ; he believes that once something becomes the property of the gossip pages , that it ’s no longer special , or belongs to him . ”
117246	117270	117243	117243	I	0	“ He ’s watched Jameson go through very public battles with the media and the ramifications it has caused in his private life . ”
117287	117309	117279	117279	I	0	“ He does n’t want that for himself or his partner . In his own way , he is protecting you . ”
117310	117327	117328	117328	I	0	“ Who would ever have thought that a media family would hate the press so much ? ”
117331	117335	117328	117328	I	0	“ The irony . ”
117339	117363	117336	117336	She	2103	“ Christopher has filled me in on your and Elliot ’s history , you have n’t always liked each other or gotten along ? ”
117364	117367	117368	117368	She	2103	“ No . ”
117375	117380	117371	117371	she	2103	“ Why is that ? ”
117423	117434	117414	117414	She	2103	“ I hold honesty in the highest regard , Kate . ”
117470	117485	117486	117486	She	2103	“ I thought he was a self - absorbed , self - righteous womanizer . ”
117491	117499	117486	117486	She	2103	“ Elliot is all of those things . ”
117504	117530	117500	117500	I	0	“ But if you get underneath all that , and not many people get the chance to , he is kind and warm and generous . ”
117540	117544	117535	117535	she	2103	“ I know . ”
117550	117562	117563	117563	I	0	“ Do n’t take this the wrong way , Mrs. Miles , ”
117566	117575	117563	117563	I	0	“ But I wish Elliot was a plumber . ”
117576	117579	117619	117619	she	2103	“ Why ? ”
117580	117610	117611	117611	She	2103	“ Because then we would come from the same world and I would n’t have to share him . And he could just be whoever he wanted to be . ”
117640	117650	117635	117635	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , I should n’t have — ”
117651	117658	117659	117659	she	2103	“ That ’s okay , dear , ”
117664	117674	117659	117659	she	2103	“ Can I ask you a question , Kate ? ”
117678	117687	117659	117659	she	2103	“ What do n’t you like about Elliot ? ”
117688	117691	117692	117692	I	0	“ Um . ”
117730	117735	117736	117736	I	0	“ Umm . . . ”
117740	117754	117736	117736	I	0	“ Be honest with me . What do n’t you like about Elliot ? ”
117755	117767	117768	117768	I	0	“ His arrogance , his money , his temper . . . ”
117778	117793	117771	117771	I	0	“ He ’s closed off and cold , reserved , and can be mean — ”
117794	117802	117803	117803	she	2103	“ What do you like about him ? ”
117812	117817	117803	117803	she	2103	“ His kind heart . ”
117829	117839	117840	117840	she	2103	“ It ’s lovely to meet you , Kathryn , ”
117843	117852	117853	117853	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry about this morning , ”
117857	117872	117853	117853	I	0	“ You ca n’t imagine how horrified I am that we met that way . ”
117873	117882	117883	117883	She	2103	“ Oh , do n’t worry about that . ”
117886	117912	117883	117883	She	2103	“ I know what my son is like , I ’m not delusional . He ’s definitely no angel and his nickname was well earned . ”
117931	117945	117925	117925	I	0	“ I ca n’t wait for you to meet Emily and Claire tonight . ”
117954	117961	117946	117946	I	0	“ It makes me so nervous . ”
117962	117967	117968	117968	She	2103	“ Do n’t be . ”
117971	117979	117968	117968	She	2103	“ We ’ve been waiting for you . ”

119219	119409	119199	119199	I	0	” I took a photo of Elliot outside near his lake the other morning . It ’s from behind , he ’s in a suit , and staring out over his enchanted estate . The ducks are gathered around his feet and the mist is rolling over the hills . It ’s a beautiful shot and I had it framed for him . What do you get the man who has everything ? Now I know . Sentiment . He loves it because it ’s sentimental . It means something to him , just like he means something to me . Being here in New York with his family has given me a little more insight into the mercurial man . He ’s not just difficult with me , he ’s difficult with everyone . And I ca n’t tell you how good that feels to know . It ’s not me , it was never me , it ’s him . We park the car and walk up to the front door ; Elliot knocks as I hold my breath . Tristan opens the door in a rush . “
119412	119431	119199	119199	I	0	” He smiles as he looks at us in turn , bends and kisses me on the cheek . “
119435	119454	119199	119199	I	0	” Elliot takes my hand and we walk into a large living area , a hive of activity . “

119477	119478	119475	119475	James	200	” “
119481	119502	119475	119475	James	200	” The little boy looks to be about three . He has dark hair and blue eyes like his father . “
119505	119517	119475	119475	James	200	” Emily smiles , leans in , and kisses my cheek . “
119523	119529	119521	119521	you	2136	” She ’s heavily pregnant . “
119538	119542	119532	119532	Imogen	201	” She smiles . “

119589	119619	119583	119583	Claire	87	” Claire smiles ; she is n’t at all what I expected . Naturally pretty , with dark hair . He takes a baby dressed in pink from her . “
119642	119655	119640	119640	Summer	203	” A bunch of kids go running and screaming through the house . “
119661	119665	119659	119659	her	2139	” he says . “
119673	119677	119666	119671	Noisiest tiny human you ever met	2140	” I giggle . “
119680	119681	119666	119671	Noisiest tiny human you ever met	2140	” “
119684	119688	119682	119682	Boys	2142	” he calls . “
119693	119708	119682	119682	Boys	2142	” I look up to see two teenagers and a small boy walking over . “
119721	119722	119719	119719	Patrick	205	” “
119725	119733	119719	119719	Patrick	205	” They all shake my hand politely . “

119748	120005	119736	119736	you	0	” Tristan smiles as he holds his hand out . I look into the back living - room area to see everyone chatting and laughing , completely relaxed , and I let out a sigh of relief . Maybe this wo n’t be so bad after all . If heaven was a week , this would be it . I put my head on Elliot ’s chest as we ride up to his apartment in the elevator , his strong arm around me , and I feel completely safe and protected . We ’ve danced and laughed , made love and fucked . Spent time with his wonderful family , and to say that Elliot Miles has romanced me around New York is the understatement of the year . In a few days we go home to London , and I never thought I ’d say this , but I do n’t want to . I want to stay here , where we have privacy and Elliot has his brothers , and I have their wives , and we do n’t have to hide under a cloak of secrecy . In London it ’s just us , but here . . . there ’s family . And I know they are n’t mine , but they ’re his , and they ’ve made me feel so welcome . We arrive up at the apartment and Elliot leads me by the hand through to the kitchen , opens the freezer , and removes a silver ice bucket . “
120010	120038	120039	120039	I	0	” I ask . He pulls out two Cornetto ice creams and hands one over ; emotion overwhelms me as I stare at it in his hand . “
120047	120121	120039	120039	I	0	” I stare at him through tears , and I know that if I did n’t already love him before . . . I honestly do now . I watch as he unwraps mine and he passes it over . I take it and wait for him to unwrap his , then he leads me out onto the balcony and we sit down on the day bed . He holds his Cornetto up . “
120126	120137	120039	120039	I	0	” I smile and tap my ice cream with his . “
120142	120168	120039	120039	I	0	” He kisses me tenderly and then licks his ice cream and I could just burst out crying as I watch him . So thoughtful . “
120173	120184	120185	120185	I	0	” he says casually as he licks his ice cream . “
120191	120197	120185	120185	I	0	” I burst out laughing . “

120537	120541	120542	120542	I	0	“ Goodnight sir . ”

121446	121485	121441	121441	They	2165	“ But then there ’s Kathryn . We hated each other for so long . I was never attracted to her . One day it was like a lightbulb went off and I could think of nothing else . ”

Never in a million years did I ever imagine my life as it is now . But I honestly believe I am where I ’m meant to be . Claire and those kids were meant for me , and the bigger picture of my destiny was already mapped out . They were my family long before I even met them ; perhaps before they were even born it was decided that they would end up being mine . ”
