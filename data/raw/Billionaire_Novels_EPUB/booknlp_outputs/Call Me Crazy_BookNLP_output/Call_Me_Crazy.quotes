2216	2245	2246	2246	She	253	“ It ’s a thing you should feel for the person you ’re proposing to . And . . . and what is that engraved on the band ? ”
2260	2270	2246	2246	She	253	“ It says ‘ Love Always , Ricky . ’ ”
2271	2276	2203	2203	I	0	“ Um . . . ”

2357	2365	2342	2342	she	253	“ It does n’t matter , anyway . ”
2375	2388	2368	2368	I	0	“ Wow . I really fucked this up , did n’t I ? ”
2389	2406	2407	2407	Reina	46	“ Yeah . You did . But it ’s not the ring that ’s the problem . ”
2420	2443	2407	2407	Reina	46	“ I ’m not in love with you , Enzo . And you ’re not in love with me , are you ? ”
2454	2460	2449	2449	I	0	“ And actually . . . ”
2469	2492	2461	2461	She	46	“ I do n’t think this is going to work . You ’re a little bit . . . old for me . ”
2498	2501	2461	2461	She	46	“ Huh ? ”
2502	2511	2512	2512	she	46	“ Not that you ’re old in general , ”
2516	2524	2512	2512	she	46	“ You ’re just old for me . ”
2560	2585	2557	2557	her	46	“ Listen , thanks for dinner , and — and everything , but I think it ’s best if we stop seeing each other . ”
2586	2589	2590	2590	I	0	“ Fine , ”
2597	2609	2610	2610	she	46	“ My friends are across the street at The Tipsy Canoe , ”
2631	2644	2610	2610	she	46	“ So I think I ’m just going to walk over there . ”
2645	2654	2610	2610	she	46	“ Let me drive you , at least . ”
2679	2696	2697	2697	She	46	“ No , really , you stay and finish the wine . I ’d rather walk . ”
2711	2718	2705	2705	her	46	“ No hard feelings , right ? ”
2733	2738	2705	2705	her	46	“ No hard feelings . ”
2739	2742	2743	2743	she	46	“ Great , ”
2753	2757	2743	2743	she	46	“ See ya . ”
2794	2797	2798	2798	she	46	“ Hey , ”
2804	2821	2798	2798	she	46	“ I just saw your date go out the door . She ditch you or what ? ”
2822	2832	2833	2833	I	0	“ We mutually decided to go our separate ways , ”
2836	2843	2798	2798	she	46	“ Tonight ? Or in general ? ”
2844	2848	2798	2798	she	46	“ In general . ”
2849	2852	2853	2853	She	46	“ Ah . ”
2856	2860	2853	2853	She	46	“ You okay ? ”
2861	2866	2798	2798	she	46	“ I ’m fine . ”
2891	2904	2905	2905	Lara	49	“ You want the bill so you can get out of here ? ”
2912	2969	2909	2909	I	0	“ Nah . I do n’t have anywhere to go . Unless you need the table , I ’ll just sit here like an old man and drink wine by myself . This is probably what I ’ll be doing for the rest of my life , anyway . Might as well get used to it . ”
2970	2986	2987	2987	Lara	49	“ Oh , come on . You know you wo n’t be alone for long . ”
2992	3014	2987	2987	Lara	49	“ But stay as long as you like . If I need to kick you out , I ’ll tell you . ”
3015	3026	3027	3027	She	49	“ Thanks . I ’ll leave you a good tip . ”
3032	3038	3027	3027	She	49	“ I know you will . ”
3088	3090	3118	3118	They	256	“ prove ”
3341	3349	3359	3359	I	0	“ Hey you . This seat taken ? ”
3389	3396	3397	3397	I	0	“ Does n’t look like it , ”
3409	3419	3400	3400	She	79	“ Thanks , I ’d love to join you . ”
3783	3790	3791	3791	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? ”
3794	3834	3791	3791	I	0	“ My family was here having dinner for my dad ’s birthday . But our family functions are short and sweet because Grandma Vinnie is ninety - six . She starts to fall asleep after an hour or so . ”
3835	3842	3843	3843	I	0	“ Wow . Ninety - six . ”
3856	3913	3914	3914	Bianca	79	“ Yes . And hitched when she was twenty - one , had five kids before she was thirty , and was married to my Grandpa Jack for seventy years before he died . Which she loves to tell me every single time I see her , right before she asks why I ’m still single . ”
3922	3931	3936	3936	she	79	“ I ’ve got some ideas on that . ”
3943	3967	3936	3936	she	79	“ So what ’s with you ? I thought I saw you with a date earlier . Either that or you were babysitting . ”
3973	3976	3977	3977	She	79	“ Funny . ”
3980	3989	3977	3977	She	79	“ So who was she ? Your girlfriend ? ”
3990	3997	3998	3998	Her	79	“ No . We broke up . ”
4002	4010	3998	3998	Her	79	“ Oh . Sorry to hear that . ”
4011	4018	3977	3977	She	79	“ No , you ’re not . ”
4019	4047	3977	3977	She	79	“ Enzo , this might come as a surprise to you , but I am not your enemy . I do n’t even dislike you — much . ”
4048	4055	4056	4056	She	79	“ Oh yeah ? Since when ? ”
4059	4085	4056	4056	She	79	“ Since we ’re not immature and awkward kids anymore , who did n’t know how to be friends with someone of the opposite sex ? ”
4086	4100	4101	4101	Her	79	“ Speak for yourself . I had plenty of friends who were girls . ”
4109	4120	4101	4101	Her	79	“ True . You always were a ladies ’ man . ”
4126	4138	4101	4101	Her	79	“ Whatever . I ’m here alone , are n’t I ? ”
4139	4196	4101	4101	Her	79	“ Wait , are you expecting me to feel sorry for you ? Like you could n’t walk right out of here and pick up the next girl you see ? There ’s not a woman alive who can resist your charms , Enzo . Those dark eyes ? That wavy hair ? The Moretti swagger ? ”
4197	4206	4207	4207	I	0	“ Apparently , I ’ve lost my touch , ”
4229	4249	4250	4250	I	0	“ Eh , I doubt that . You were n’t really into that girl , anyway , were you ? ”
4253	4258	4223	4223	her	291	“ She was okay . ”
4259	4265	4207	4207	I	0	“ You can do better . ”
4266	4273	4223	4223	her	291	“ Better is n’t the issue . ”
4274	4280	4223	4223	her	291	“ What ’s the issue ? ”
4281	4284	4207	4207	I	0	“ Fast . ”
4285	4288	4289	4289	She	291	“ Why ? ”
4292	4304	4289	4289	She	291	“ Are you going to turn into a pumpkin at midnight ? ”
4305	4333	4334	4334	Her	291	“ No , I ’m going to lose Moretti & Sons to my brother Pietro if I do n’t get married before I ’m thirty - five . ”
4338	4341	4334	4334	Her	291	“ Seriously ? ”
4364	4373	4346	4346	I	0	“ I need another drink . Something stronger . ”
4374	4378	4379	4379	she	291	“ Me too , ”
4530	4533	4534	4534	she	291	“ What ? ”
4550	4560	4545	4545	She	291	“ Why are you looking at me like that ? ”
4561	4575	4576	4576	Her	291	“ I ’m wondering what your parents fed you that stunted your growth . ”
4586	4597	4581	4581	she	291	“ I am average height , thank you very much . ”
4598	4606	4607	4607	She	291	“ Average for what , a chipmunk ? ”
4619	4646	4616	4616	her	291	“ Always so obsessed with size . What are we to make of that , Dr. Freud ? Is he worried he does n’t measure up ? ”
4647	4666	4667	4667	I	0	“ Hey , that was you who started the rumor about the size of my — my stuff , ”
4676	4684	4667	4667	I	0	“ Totally unfounded , I might add . ”
4685	4690	4691	4691	She	291	“ Okay , okay . ”
4702	4713	4691	4691	She	291	“ It ’s time for me to apologize for that . ”
4714	4722	4723	4723	I	0	“ I ’m not sure I accept , ”
4727	4762	4723	4723	I	0	“ You ca n’t insult a guy ’s manhood like that — without even seeing it — and just expect him to say it ’s no big deal . You besmirched the family jewels . ”
4774	4793	4765	4765	she	291	“ I ’m truly sorry for what I said , and I shall never besmirch your jewels again . ”
4794	4802	4803	4803	She	291	“ Why ’d you do that anyway ? ”
4815	4833	4803	4803	She	291	“ To get back at you for asking every girl to dance but me , of course . ”
4834	4837	4838	4838	I	0	“ What ? ”
4841	4855	4838	4838	I	0	“ That ’s ridiculous . You did n’t want to dance with me . ”
4856	4866	4803	4803	She	291	“ How do you know ? You never asked . ”
4867	4884	4885	4885	She	291	“ Bianca , you brought a fucking book with you and read it the entire time . ”
4891	4916	4885	4885	She	291	“ Twilight is n’t just a book to me , Enzo . It ’s a whole world . I still reread it every year . ”
4917	4928	4803	4803	She	291	“ Twilight ? Is n’t that about a teenage vampire ? ”
4929	4938	4939	4939	I	0	“ At least that vampire was a gentleman . ”
4944	4979	4939	4939	I	0	“ Whatever . You refused to even talk to me , and I was bored , so I asked some other girls to dance . I did n’t think it was a big deal . ”
4980	4988	4989	4989	she	291	“ Well , it hurt my feelings , ”
5000	5040	4989	4989	she	291	“ I was already aware you did n’t want to be there — I knew your parents made you take me . And I felt horrible about it , so I copped the bad attitude to hide my humiliation . ”
5041	5072	4939	4939	I	0	“ Well , I did n’t know any of that , because you never said anything . But I ’m . . . I ’m sorry I hurt your feelings . ”
5073	5079	5080	5080	she	291	“ Your apology is accepted , ”
5083	5092	5080	5080	she	291	“ Now are you going to accept mine ? ”
5093	5097	5098	5098	I	0	“ I guess , ”
5112	5123	5105	5105	She	291	“ Thank you . So can we be friends now ? ”
5124	5131	5132	5132	I	0	“ I suppose we can try , ”
5135	5160	5132	5132	I	0	“ although I still do n’t understand why you were so stuck - up back then , always too good to talk to me . ”
5161	5175	5176	5176	she	291	“ I was n’t stuck - up , Enzo , I was shy ! ”
5185	5270	5176	5176	she	291	“ And you were always surrounded by girls batting their lashes and tossing their long blond hair and giggling like idiots at everything you said . Just because I was n’t one of them does n’t mean I thought I was too good for you . Frankly , I ’m shocked you even remember me from back then . It ’s not like you ever noticed when I was in the room , what with your ego taking up all the space around you . ”
5271	5282	5283	5283	I	0	“ Okay , maybe we should leave the past alone , ”
5295	5305	5288	5288	I	0	“ Clearly , we are always going to disagree . ”
5306	5311	5312	5312	She	294	“ Fine with me . ”
5328	5342	5312	5312	She	294	“ So how ’s your ego tonight ? A little bruised , huh ? ”
5343	5348	5349	5349	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
5359	5378	5349	5349	I	0	“ Reina obviously was n’t the right choice for a wife . I ’m glad she said no . ”
5387	5392	5379	5379	Bianca	79	“ Wait a minute . ”
5402	5417	5379	5379	Bianca	79	“ You proposed to — to — what was the little girl ’s name ? ”
5418	5434	5349	5349	I	0	“ Reina . And you ’ve got no room to call someone little , Tiny . ”
5450	5470	5471	5471	I	0	“ We ’re talking about you right now . Did you actually propose tonight ? Like with a ring ? ”
5480	5486	5487	5487	Her	294	“ Yeah . I did . ”
5492	5498	5487	5487	Her	294	“ Let me see it . ”
5499	5502	5487	5487	Her	294	“ No . ”
5503	5507	5487	5487	Her	294	“ Why not ? ”
5508	5520	5487	5487	Her	294	“ Because you just want to rub salt in my wound . ”
5521	5564	5565	5565	She	294	“ For fuck ’s sake , Enzo . You ’re not wounded . You do n’t even love this girl , you just needed to put a ring on her finger so your dad would put your name on the company letterhead . ”
5571	5577	5565	5565	She	294	“ Now give it here . ”
5611	5616	5617	5617	she	294	“ It ’s pretty , ”
5636	5643	5624	5624	she	294	“ Did you have it engraved ? ”
5655	5658	5644	5644	I	0	“ No . ”
5659	5666	5667	5667	She	294	“ But it says . . . ”
5689	5697	5685	5685	she	294	“ ‘ Love Always , Ricky ? ’ ”
5698	5703	5685	5685	she	294	“ Give me that . ”
5726	5738	5718	5718	she	294	“ Just a second ! I want to try it on . ”
5788	5795	5782	5782	her	79	“ So what did you say ? ”
5796	5800	5718	5718	she	294	“ I proposed . ”
5801	5832	5718	5718	she	294	“ But how ? Like , did you say , ‘ You ’re the love of my life and I want to be with you forever ’ kind of thing ? ”
5833	5859	5860	5860	I	0	“ Uh , not exactly . I did n’t want to lie to her . I just , you know , gave her the ring . ”
5871	5879	5860	5860	I	0	“ But you must have said something . ”
5880	5887	5888	5888	I	0	“ What difference does it make ? ”
5892	5931	5888	5888	I	0	“ Look , I ’m only trying to help you . You obviously blew it tonight , and by your own admission , you need to find a Lucy for your Ricky sooner rather than later , right ? ”
5949	5952	5953	5953	Bianca	79	“ Right ? ”
5964	5971	5957	5957	her	79	“ So let me help you . ”
5972	5985	5986	5986	I	0	“ The only way you could help me is to marry me , ”
5993	6008	5986	5986	I	0	“ And since that ’s out of the question , this discussion is over . ”
6009	6025	6026	6026	I	0	“ Well , wait a minute . Who said it ’s out of the question ? ”
6036	6039	6026	6026	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
6050	6084	6040	6040	Bianca	79	“ I ’m just thinking out loud here . But it seems to me we each have a goal , and they could both be accomplished with one simple — fake — relationship . ”
6101	6117	6118	6118	She	79	“ I know I ’m drunk , but what the hell are you talking about ? ”
6129	6175	6118	6118	She	79	“ I ’m talking about the fact that you need a wife to get what you want . I ’m willing to be that wife — temporarily , and under the strictest of conditions — if you ’ll agree to give me what I want . ”
6181	6209	6178	6178	my	0	“ Oh , no . No fucking way . I see what you ’re doing here . I ’m not paying you to fake being my wife . ”
6215	6236	6212	6212	her	79	“ Give me a break , Enzo . I do n’t want your money . Nor do I need it . ”
6237	6244	6245	6245	I	0	“ Then I do n’t understand , ”
6259	6271	6245	6245	I	0	“ What could you possibly want that I could give you ? ”
6286	6290	6245	6245	I	0	“ A baby . ”
6302	6306	6296	6296	Enzo	42	“ A what ? ”
6307	6311	6312	6312	His	297	“ A baby . ”
6320	6324	6312	6312	His	297	“ Whose baby ? ”
6325	6332	6333	6333	I	0	“ Mine . And . . . ”
6342	6345	6333	6333	I	0	“ Yours . ”
6346	6354	6355	6355	I	0	“ I do n’t have a baby . ”
6358	6392	6355	6355	I	0	“ Enzo , I know you ’re somewhat inebriated , but try to keep up . You need a wife . I would like a baby . One and one can make three . ”
6408	6414	6400	6400	he	297	“ This makes no sense . ”
6415	6423	6424	6424	His	297	“ It makes perfect sense , actually . ”
6428	6437	6424	6424	His	297	“ I do n’t want to marry you . ”
6438	6447	6448	6448	I	0	“ You do n’t want to marry anyone , ”
6452	6455	6448	6448	I	0	“ True . ”
6456	6488	6424	6424	His	297	“ At least if you marry me , there ’s an agreed - upon expiration date . We only have to stay married long enough to get you what you want . ”
6495	6504	6424	6424	His	297	“ And what I want , of course . ”
6505	6519	6448	6448	I	0	“ That ’s the other thing . What is this about a baby ? ”
6546	6596	6541	6541	I	0	“ Well , the baby is something I ’ve been thinking about for a while . I ’ve always wanted children , but I have n’t met the one yet , and unfortunately for a woman , the biological clock is an actual thing . And mine is ticking . ”
6597	6603	6543	6543	my	0	“ How old are you ? ”
6604	6614	6543	6543	my	0	“ I ’ll be thirty - three next month . ”
6615	6638	6541	6541	I	0	“ That ’s not that old . My mother had my brother Matteo when she was like thirty - eight or something . ”
6639	6651	6543	6543	my	0	“ I ’ve got some additional reproductive health concerns , okay ? ”
6666	6713	6658	6658	I	0	“ Without going into detail , I ’ll just say that it would be better for me to try to get pregnant sooner rather than later . It ’s likely I ’ll struggle to conceive , so putting it off will only be worse for me . ”
6732	6746	6717	6717	he	298	“ So how would that even work ? Would we have to actually — ”
6747	6750	6751	6751	I	0	“ No ! ”
6767	6788	6751	6751	I	0	“ It would all be done in a fertility clinic . You ’d donate your . . . you know . ”
6799	6803	6789	6789	I	0	“ Genetic material . ”
6811	6816	6789	6789	I	0	“ My genetic material ? ”
6817	6820	6821	6821	My	0	“ Yes . ”
6838	6875	6826	6826	I	0	“ The procedure is called an intrauterine insemination . You provide the , um , DNA , it gets washed and concentrated , and then a nurse performs the . . . placement into my uterus . ”
6876	6893	6894	6894	I	0	“ Oh , like the thing with the turkey baster ? I ’ve heard about that . ”
6911	6917	6903	6904	a principal	299	“ Yes , sort of . ”
6918	6926	6927	6927	he	298	“ That does n’t sound very sexy , ”
6947	6956	6957	6957	I	0	“ It ’s not supposed to be sexy , ”
6961	6966	6957	6957	I	0	“ It ’s science . ”
6967	7005	6903	6904	a principal	299	“ Okay , so what then , you get pregnant with our science baby and then I ’m supposed to divorce you while you ’re pregnant ? No fucking way . I ’ll look like a monster . ”
7006	7019	7020	7020	I	0	“ We can wait until after it ’s born if you want , ”
7024	7072	7020	7020	I	0	“ I ’m just not sure how long it will take for me to get pregnant . I suppose we could write it into our contract that if I do n’t get pregnant within a certain amount of time , the whole thing is null and void . ”
7083	7098	7080	7080	his	298	“ But if you do get pregnant , I ’m an asshole for leaving . ”
7105	7118	7099	7099	I	0	“ I ’ll take all the blame . I ’ll leave you . ”
7119	7140	7141	7141	he	298	“ But I must have done something to make you leave . I ’m the asshole in all your ideas , ”
7144	7167	7141	7141	he	298	“ No . If we do this , it would have to be an amicable parting . No one gets the blame . ”
7168	7180	7099	7099	I	0	“ Okay , fine . We ’d split up as friends . ”
7181	7190	7191	7191	I	0	“ We ’re not even friends right now . ”
7197	7232	7191	7191	I	0	“ So we ’ll split up as non - friends ! However you want to end things , Enzo , I ’ll agree to it . As long as I leave with the baby . ”
7238	7259	7233	7233	Enzo	42	“ That ’s the other thing . I ’m supposed to just father this baby and never see it again ? ”
7260	7307	7191	7191	I	0	“ I never said that . You can see him or her whenever you ’d like . I wo n’t move away or anything . I want to live near my family — that ’s why I moved back to Bellamy Creek in the first place . ”
7308	7322	7323	7323	He	301	“ So I ’d be like . . . Weekend Dad or something ? ”
7340	7345	7333	7333	he	301	“ If you want . ”
7362	7379	7357	7357	he	301	“ I do n’t know . It does n’t seem right to do to a kid . ”
7380	7383	7384	7384	I	0	“ Enzo . ”
7404	7441	7384	7384	I	0	“ I ’ve been thinking about having a baby on my own for a couple years now . I ’ve researched fertility clinics , looked over donor profiles , talked with my family and my therapist . ”
7442	7448	7357	7357	he	301	“ What did they say ? ”
7449	7459	7460	7460	I	0	“ My therapist understands . My family does not . ”
7466	7604	7460	7460	I	0	“ They ’re totally against it . They can not imagine why I ’d want to get pregnant with a stranger ’s baby or raise a child on my own . But they ’re Catholic and old - fashioned , and they want for me what they had for themselves , and it ’s just not going to happen — not in time for me to have a baby , anyway . I know I could always adopt , and I absolutely would , although I think it ’s more difficult for an unmarried woman to adopt than for a couple . I admit , I have n’t done all the research . Because I really would like to experience being pregnant and giving birth if I can . I know I ’ll be a good mom . ”
7616	7628	7631	7631	him	303	“ You can not imagine the things people say to me , ”
7646	7650	7642	7642	He	303	“ Like what ? ”
7651	7717	7751	7751	his	303	“ Like , ‘ At your age , you should lower your standards and just find a man willing to commit . ’ Or ‘ You may have to settle down with a man who already has kids , if you really want them . ’ Or ‘ You ’re a beautiful woman . It ca n’t be that hard to get knocked up . ’ ”
7718	7725	7726	7726	Enzo	42	“ Someone said that to you ? ”
7731	7744	7726	7726	Enzo	42	“ Yes . People say that shit to women all the time . ”
7745	7748	7749	7749	He	303	“ Fuck . ”
7782	7793	7794	7794	I	0	“ You ’re probably wondering , ‘ Why me ? ’ ”
7814	7818	7798	7798	His	303	“ Not really . ”
7827	7836	7821	7821	I	0	“ Well , I ’ll tell you anyway . ”
7837	7841	7842	7842	He	303	“ Please do . ”
7853	7937	7938	7938	He	303	“ I know we ’ve had our differences in the past , but we go back a long way , and that means something to me . Our families go back a long way . There ’s trust and loyalty and respect . There ’s a history of . . . of showing up for each other . And I was just thinking , even with our somewhat rocky past , that we ’d show up for each other . Would n’t we ? ”
7951	7964	7938	7938	He	303	“ Nothing means more to me than family . That ’s true . ”
7965	7986	7987	7987	I	0	“ I think beneath it all , we share the same traditional family values — albeit with some modern adjustments , ”
7990	8025	7987	7987	I	0	“ I do n’t think a woman should have to be married to have a baby , and you do n’t think a man should have to be married to inherit the family business . ”
8032	8062	8026	8026	Enzo	42	“ But I believe in honesty too , and this plan of yours involves lying to our families and friends . And my closest friends are family to me . ”
8063	8085	8086	8086	I	0	“ I know , and I do n’t love that part of it . But I do like that about you , ”
8090	8149	8086	8086	I	0	“ the fact that you ’d hesitate before deceiving the people you love . It ’s part of what makes me want you to be the father of my baby , despite your enormously inflated ego . Deep down , like way deep , buried beneath layer upon layer of vanity , pride , and self - absorption — ”
8150	8155	8156	8156	He	306	“ Okay , okay . ”
8163	8166	8156	8156	He	306	“ Enough . ”
8173	8197	8167	8167	I	0	“ Deep down , I do believe you are a decent man . Honorable . Trustworthy . Protective of those you care about . ”
8198	8206	8207	8207	he	306	“ Do n’t forget about my face , ”
8228	8232	8233	8233	I	0	“ Your face ? ”
8257	8273	8274	8274	He	306	“ I suppose it ’s passably attractive . I ’ve never really looked that close . ”
8281	8301	8278	8278	his	306	“ Fine , be that way . I will donate my passable looks to your turkey - baster baby . ”
8302	8306	8307	8307	My	0	“ You will ? ”
8313	8317	8318	8318	He	306	“ Why not ? ”
8334	8395	8323	8323	he	306	“ I ’m not sure we ’re going to fool anybody , but what the hell ? I ’ve got nothing to lose . I do want to be a dad , and I ’m not getting any younger . And fake - marrying you sounds better than real - marrying anyone else — as long as it ’s temporary . ”
8396	8412	8413	8413	I	0	“ I suppose that ’s the best proposal I ’m going to get , huh ? ”
8422	8436	8413	8413	I	0	“ Well , Ricky , I guess you ’ve got yourself a Lucy . ”
8440	8445	8446	8448	My younger sister	308	“ You did what ? ”
8477	8500	8465	8465	She	60	“ I asked Enzo Moretti to be the father of my baby , and in return , I offered to marry him . ”
8501	8508	8509	8509	Ellie	60	“ Bianca , what the hell ? ”
8520	8531	8509	8509	Ellie	60	“ Why would you do that ? It sounds psychotic . ”
8532	8546	8547	8547	I	0	“ It ’s not psychotic . It ’s very logical , in fact . ”
8561	8584	8547	8547	I	0	“ It ’s going to get both of us exactly what we want with the added bonus of being a temporary situation . ”
8585	8599	8600	8600	I	0	“ Temporary ? Uh , last I checked , a baby is forever . ”
8603	8633	8600	8600	I	0	“ I know the baby is forever , but the marriage wo n’t be . It ’s just a marriage of convenience . Happens all the time in books . ”
8634	8663	8547	8547	I	0	“ Yeah , but this is n’t a book , Tiny — it ’s real life . What you ’re talking about sounds insane ! A fake wedding ? ”
8664	8667	8668	8668	I	0	“ Shhhh ! ”
8753	8765	8747	8749	my fertility specialist	315	“ The wedding wo n’t be fake . Just our feelings . ”
8766	8776	8728	8728	God	50	“ So why even bother with a real marriage ? ”
8777	8828	8831	8831	her	316	“ Well , we talked about that , and we agreed that we really do have to get married in order for this to work . His dad has to be convinced it ’s legit . Also , I ’d like it to be legal for the baby ’s sake . ”
8834	8839	8831	8831	her	316	“ This is nuts . ”
8840	8846	8853	8853	she	60	“ But it ’s happening . ”
8969	8981	8982	8982	she	60	“ So what are you going to tell Mom and Dad ? ”
8985	9002	8982	8982	she	60	“ It ’s not like you can pretend you ’ve been dating him all this time . ”
9003	9006	9007	9007	I	0	“ No , ”
9010	9022	9023	9023	Ellie	60	“ That ’s why I ’m not wearing the ring yet . ”
9031	9039	9023	9023	Ellie	60	“ He already gave you a ring ? ”
9040	9043	9044	9044	I	0	“ Yes . ”
9049	9093	9044	9044	I	0	“ Things progressed quickly last night . And that ’s what I ’m going to tell the family . We ran into each other at DiFiore ’s after Dad ’s birthday dinner . We talked for hours . We fell madly in love . ”
9099	9106	9096	9096	her	60	“ No one will believe it . ”
9107	9117	9118	9118	I	0	“ Listen , I need your support on this , ”
9121	9140	9118	9118	I	0	“ You have to back me up , Ellie — or I agree , it wo n’t work . ”
9141	9144	9096	9096	her	60	“ But — ”
9145	9165	9166	9166	I	0	“ I was there for you when you came out to Mom and Dad and told them about Sierra , ”
9170	9175	9176	9176	she	60	“ That ’s different , ”
9179	9206	9176	9176	she	60	“ I am actually a lesbian . Sierra and I are genuinely in love . You ’re asking me to back you up in a lie . ”
9207	9212	9213	9213	I	0	“ Right . Sorry , ”
9219	9229	9213	9213	I	0	“ I just really want you on my side . ”
9230	9237	9238	9238	She	60	“ I am on your side . ”
9242	9280	9238	9238	She	60	“ I ’m not sure it ’s the best way to go about having a baby , but if you ’re determined to do it , I ’ll support you . What do I have to do ? ”
9288	9323	9281	9281	I	0	“ Just be publicly happy for me . Shut down any doubts anyone raises that this is n’t the real thing . Be amazed that it happened and yet totally convinced this is fate . ”
9324	9342	9213	9213	I	0	“ That ’s a tall order . You could n’t stand Enzo Moretti when you were young . ”
9343	9358	9359	9359	I	0	“ Honestly , there are some things about him that still drive me nuts , ”
9362	9385	9359	9359	I	0	“ But I do n’t need to love him for this . In fact , it works better if I do n’t . ”
9386	9392	9213	9213	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
9393	9433	9434	9434	I	0	“ Because when it ’s time to end it all , I wo n’t be in pieces about it . I ’ll be just fine walking away . And besides , I did n’t really hate him back then , ”
9437	9475	9434	9434	I	0	“ I just hated the fact that girls were always tripping over themselves to be with him , and he lapped up all the attention like a Golden Retriever . I thought he was obnoxious and conceited . ”
9476	9480	9213	9213	I	0	“ Fair enough . ”
9481	9490	9491	9491	I	0	“ And maybe I was a little jealous , ”
9494	9497	9491	9491	I	0	“ Jealous ? ”
9506	9510	9498	9498	She	323	“ Of him ? ”
9511	9525	9213	9213	I	0	“ Kind of . Or maybe I was jealous of those flirty girls . ”
9533	9598	9526	9526	I	0	“ I was just so shy . I wanted him to pay attention to me , but I did n’t know how to show it . He was just so good - looking and confident . I was tongue - tied around him . So I pretended to hate him . It was easier than admitting I liked him . Know what I mean ? ”
9599	9603	9213	9213	I	0	“ I guess . ”
9604	9637	9498	9498	She	323	“ But that ’s all ancient history . We made our peace with each other last night and agreed to leave the past in the past . What matters is the future . ”
9638	9646	9526	9526	I	0	“ So when are you getting married ? ”
9647	9677	9213	9213	I	0	“ Not sure yet . We ’re actually having dinner tonight to hammer out the details of the contract . We both have some stipulations we want in writing . ”
9678	9695	9498	9498	She	323	“ This is so weird . It sounds like a business deal , not an engagement . ”
9696	9728	9526	9526	I	0	“ That ’s exactly what it is . We ’re clear on the mission , but we ’re going to clarify our vision , define our purpose , discuss the timeline . ”
9729	9734	9735	9735	Ellie	60	“ Oh my God . ”
9749	9759	9741	9741	she	60	“ Romance is really dead , is n’t it ? ”
9760	9769	9770	9770	I	0	“ I do n’t want romance , Ellie , ”
9776	9858	9770	9770	I	0	“ Look , I tried for romance . I was with Tate for five solid years before I realized he was never going to marry me — I wasted five years of my life believing his lies and letting him push aside all the serious conversations I tried to have about the future . And now there is n’t anything I would n’t do to get just one of those years back . What if it ’s too late for me ? ”
9859	9866	9867	9867	Ellie	60	“ I ’m sorry , B , ”
9874	9897	9867	9867	Ellie	60	“ I know how hurt you were after Tate . If you ’re determined to do this thing , I support you . ”
9898	9967	9770	9770	I	0	“ I ’m more than determined , Ellie . I want to have a baby , and I ’m done waiting for it . Why should n’t I get to experience being a mom just because I have n’t found real love ? I was willing to use an anonymous donor , but thankfully , I do n’t have to . My child can actually know its father . ”
9968	9976	9977	9977	she	324	“ And Enzo is up for that ? ”
9980	9987	9977	9977	she	324	“ Raising a child with you ? ”
9988	9994	9995	9995	I	0	“ He said he was . ”
10006	10026	10001	10001	I	0	“ But he was also drunk . Tonight , I want to have a completely sober conversation about this . ”
10027	10031	10032	10032	She	324	“ Good idea . ”
10038	10048	10032	10032	She	324	“ What will you do if he says no ? ”
10067	10093	10094	10094	She	324	“ I ’ll move on . That ’s the beauty of this , Ellie . I ’m not giving Enzo Moretti my heart to break . ”
10100	10112	10094	10094	She	324	“ So are you actually going to do it with him ? ”
10113	10131	10132	10132	She	324	“ No ! I ’ll still have an artificial insemination . He ’ll just provide the sperm . ”
10135	10172	10132	10132	She	324	“ Too bad . Seems like if you ’re going to marry a guy as hot as Enzo Moretti , you should at least get a couple perks out of it , like seeing him naked . ”
10173	10183	10184	10184	I	0	“ I do n’t want to see him naked , ”
10434	10437	10438	10438	I	0	“ Hey , ”
10441	10446	10438	10438	I	0	“ Come on in . ”
10464	10470	10471	10471	he	334	“ This is for you , ”
10481	10505	10471	10471	he	334	“ It ’s one of my favorites , but do n’t let me have any . My head still hurts from last night . ”
10506	10510	10511	10511	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
10536	10543	10544	10544	He	334	“ Can I take your coat ? ”
10709	10715	10716	10716	he	334	“ Smells great in here , ”
10733	10739	10716	10716	he	334	“ What are we having ? ”
10740	10752	10753	10753	I	0	“ Pappardelle with sausage , kale , and spicy tomato sauce . ”
10769	10778	10753	10753	I	0	“ Can I get you something to drink ? ”
10779	10784	10785	10785	I	0	“ Water ’s fine . ”
10800	10803	10804	10804	He	334	“ Rehydrating ? ”
10813	10867	10804	10804	He	334	“ Yeah . Next time I think it ’s a good idea to drink an entire bottle of Barolo with bourbon for dessert , remind me of the headache I have today . And how I could n’t drive myself home . And how I had to go get my car before church . ”
10868	10881	10882	10882	I	0	“ You got up for church this morning ? I ’m impressed . ”
10899	10905	10906	10906	He	334	“ Of course I did . ”
10923	10933	10917	10917	he	334	“ Father Mike and I are tight these days . ”
10934	10943	10909	10909	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? And why ’s that ? ”
10944	11008	11009	11009	He	334	“ Because I needed a miracle to avoid getting married , and I figured Father Mike might have an in . Also I wanted God to see me helping my Nonna into the pew , getting on my knees to pray , putting money in the collection basket , admitting I ’m a sinner , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . ”
11034	11065	11020	11020	I	0	“ I ’m not sure God ’s going to look favorably enough on your et cetera brand of piety to provide a miracle . What would that even look like ? ”
11066	11094	11009	11009	He	334	“ My dad would change his mind about this stupid settling down bullshit . I could just live my life the way I want to live it . ”
11095	11105	11106	11106	I	0	“ I thought you said you wanted a family , ”
11118	11147	11106	11106	I	0	“ I do . But why does he have to put this arbitrary number on it ? Why ca n’t I just do it when I ’m ready ? ”
11148	11154	11155	11155	I	0	“ It does seem unfair , ”
11159	11189	11155	11155	I	0	“ But then again , so does the whole biological clock thing . Men can reliably and safely father children long past the age women can easily conceive them . ”
11190	11199	11200	11200	he	341	“ Yeah , that seems like bullshit too , ”
11203	11215	11200	11200	he	341	“ Do you want me to do something to help you ? ”
11228	11232	11216	11216	I	0	“ You cook ? ”
11233	11239	11240	11240	He	341	“ Yes , I cook . ”
11245	11269	11242	11242	his	341	“ I moved out of my parents ’ house when I was eighteen . I would have starved if I could n’t cook . ”
11270	11288	11289	11289	I	0	“ In that case , can you check the pasta ? I think it ’s probably done . ”
11297	11308	11289	11289	I	0	“ Grab a fork from that drawer to your right . ”
11383	11386	11380	11380	he	341	“ Done . ”
11387	11407	11408	11408	He	341	“ Okay , switch the gas off on that burner , please . And the one under the sauce . ”
11500	11504	11505	11505	I	0	“ Need help ? ”
11510	11513	11514	11514	He	341	“ Yes . ”
11556	11581	11514	11514	He	341	“ There you go . You should have asked them to put a rolling ladder in here for you . Like at a library . ”
11582	11609	11613	11613	he	341	“ Very funny . If you want to be useful , grab that colander and drain the pasta . Reserve about a cup of the water . ”
11749	11757	11758	11758	he	341	“ You want this in the sauce ? ”
11770	11775	11758	11758	he	341	“ Yes . Thanks . ”
11787	11803	11778	11778	him	341	“ I ’ll take it from here . You can sit down if you want . ”
11804	11807	11808	11808	He	341	“ Okay . ”
11816	11826	11808	11808	He	341	“ Can I pour you a glass of wine ? ”
11827	11832	11833	11833	I	0	“ Uh , sure . ”
11866	11869	11870	11870	I	0	“ Opener ? ”
11969	11974	11953	11953	Enzo	42	“ This looks incredible . ”
11975	11985	12004	12004	he	341	“ You do n’t have to sound so surprised . ”
12009	12015	12016	12016	he	341	“ That was a compliment , ”
12021	12050	12016	12016	he	341	“ See , this is the problem with women . You try to say something nice , and they do n’t know how to just say thank you . ”
12051	12059	12060	12060	I	0	“ I ’ll try to remember that , ”
12106	12109	12110	12110	she	350	“ So , ”
12118	12129	12110	12110	she	350	“ should we wait until after dinner to talk business ? ”
12130	12134	12135	12135	I	0	“ No need , ”
12148	12179	12135	12135	I	0	“ We can talk now if you ’d like . And if there ’s anything we need to get in writing , we can do it when we ’re finished . ”
12187	12196	12180	12180	She	350	“ So you ’re still up for this ? ”
12197	12204	12205	12205	My	0	“ I am . Are you ? ”
12216	12243	12205	12205	My	0	“ Yes . I just felt like maybe I should double - check with you , since your decision - making abilities were impaired last night . ”
12254	12270	12244	12244	She	350	“ Well , today I ’m stone cold sober , and I ’m still in . ”
12271	12277	12278	12278	She	350	“ Excellent . So am I. ”
12288	12304	12285	12285	her	350	“ So the way I see it , there are three phases to this project , ”
12318	12334	12305	12305	I	0	“ The engagement , the marriage — which includes the baby — and the breakup . ”
12335	12340	12244	12244	She	350	“ Sounds about right . ”
12341	12387	12388	12388	I	0	“ I do n’t think we should wait on the engagement . It might seem like it ’s coming out of left field , but we should probably fake the whole falling in love thing quickly , and just make the announcement we ’re married . ”
12408	12426	12427	12427	She	350	“ I figure we can do like a City Hall thing and tell them after the fact . ”
12440	12453	12427	12427	She	350	“ So there wo n’t be an actual wedding ? With guests ? ”
12454	12468	12521	12521	She	350	“ I was n’t planning on it . Why ? You want one ? ”
12469	12501	12502	12502	I	0	“ Not a big one . But what if this is the only chance I ever have to wear a white dress and have my father walk me down the aisle ? ”
12510	12520	12521	12521	She	350	“ Can it be the aisle at City Hall ? ”
12525	12557	12521	12521	She	350	“ I suppose I could deal with that . It might even be better because then we wo n’t have to lie to a priest . I was nervous about that . ”
12558	12561	12562	12562	I	0	“ Same , ”
12571	12598	12599	12599	She	350	“ I think it ’s best if we keep God out of this . Otherwise , one of us might be struck by lightning or something . ”
12602	12645	12599	12599	She	350	“ So the story will go that we ran into each other after dinner last night and realized , lo and behold , that we ’ve been wrong about each other all these years , and suddenly we ’re head over heels . ”
12656	12659	12646	12646	I	0	“ Whatever . ”
12660	12680	12681	12681	She	350	“ Probably we need to date for at least a month before you propose , do n’t you think ? ”
12690	12702	12681	12681	She	350	“ Lest our families think we ’ve completely lost our minds ? ”
12712	12765	12709	12709	I	0	“ Yeah , you might be right . I do n’t want my dad to pull some bullshit where he says we have to be together for a certain amount of time before he ’ll give me the business . He has to believe we ’re in love and this is real . ”
12771	12785	12766	12766	I	0	“ You sure you ’re going to be able to pull this off ? ”
12791	12795	12786	12786	She	350	“ Are you ? ”
12800	12827	12828	12828	Her	350	“ Yes . I ’ll have you know , I ’m a great actor . I played Romeo when I was a senior in high school . ”
12839	12842	12828	12828	Her	350	“ What ? ”
12843	12904	12828	12828	Her	350	“ I ’m serious . Some girl I liked at the time was all into theater and shit , and she convinced me to try out . I did n’t really think I ’d get the role , but I did . And she was so psyched about it , she gave me a blowjob that very day after school . ”
12908	12919	12905	12905	I	0	“ So I figured I should actually do the play . ”
12926	12937	12923	12923	her	79	“ Of course that ’s why you did the play . ”
12938	12944	12945	12945	I	0	“ I was good too . ”
12959	12968	12945	12945	I	0	“ Thus with a kiss , I die . ”
12974	12987	12969	12969	She	79	“ Just when I think you ca n’t be any more ridiculous . ”
12988	12991	12992	12992	I	0	“ Whatever . ”
12997	13018	12992	12992	I	0	“ My point is that I know I can be convincing . I hope you ’re up for the challenge . ”
13019	13044	13045	13045	she	79	“ I will admit that acting wildly in love with you is going to be a challenge , but I will do my best , ”
13054	13062	13045	13045	she	79	“ Do n’t expect any blowjobs though . ”
13077	13099	13063	13063	I	0	“ I would n’t dare . So what will be allowed ? We have to give them something . Hand holding ? ”
13100	13103	13045	13045	she	79	“ Sure . ”
13104	13111	13063	13063	I	0	“ Can I kiss your cheek ? ”
13112	13116	13117	13117	she	79	“ I suppose , ”
13133	13145	13117	13117	she	79	“ Just for show . But no kissing on the lips . ”
13146	13165	13063	13063	I	0	“ Agreed . But if I put my arm around you , are you going to slap me ? ”
13166	13183	13063	13063	I	0	“ Just keep your hands where they belong , Enzo , and we ’ll be fine . ”
13184	13189	13190	13190	I	0	“ Works for me , ”
13255	13261	13262	13262	she	79	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
13265	13268	13262	13262	she	79	“ Nothing . ”
13303	13308	13309	13309	she	79	“ So the marriage , ”
13313	13320	13309	13309	she	79	“ I ’ve got some rules . ”
13321	13325	13289	13289	she	79	“ Hit me . ”
13326	13355	13289	13289	she	79	“ It ’s purely for show . There is no marriage bed . There will be no consummation . Not on the wedding night or any night after . ”
13356	13360	13289	13289	she	79	“ Party pooper . ”
13361	13371	13289	13289	she	79	“ And we ’ll do the insemination right away . ”
13372	13388	13289	13289	she	79	“ No problem . I can not wait to inseminate you from one room away . ”
13389	13424	13425	13425	She	79	“ And if it does n’t work the first time , I ’d like two more tries . If it does n’t work after three tries , we can move to the divorce phase . ”
13435	13446	13429	13429	she	79	“ You do n’t think it ’s going to work ? ”
13451	13469	13447	13447	Her	79	“ Hard to say . Women who have PCOS like I do have reduced odds of conceiving . ”
13470	13485	13486	13486	I	0	“ Well , that ’s because they ’ve never tried it with a Moretti . ”
13491	13502	13486	13486	I	0	“ The men in my family have very strong genes . ”
13503	13509	13510	13510	She	79	“ Oh , good Lord . ”
13515	13549	13510	13510	She	79	“ It does n’t have anything to do with your genes , Enzo . It has to do with my eggs . But I do n’t really want to talk about that now . ”
13550	13554	13555	13555	She	79	“ Suit yourself . ”
13564	13581	13555	13555	She	79	“ I ’d like to give it three tries . If you ’re okay with it . ”
13585	13599	13582	13582	I	0	“ I ’m fine with it . I can jerk off three times . ”
13600	13609	13610	13610	She	79	“ Can you not say it like that ? ”
13615	13632	13610	13610	She	79	“ That ’s what it is , right ? Why not call a spade a spade ? ”
13633	13648	13582	13582	I	0	“ I prefer providing a sample . You will provide a sample three times . ”
13649	13657	13658	13658	I	0	“ If it makes you feel better , ”
13661	13669	13612	13612	her	79	“ But it ’s exactly the same — ”
13670	13676	13677	13677	she	79	“ If it does work , ”
13684	13718	13677	13677	she	79	“ we should probably at least stay married until it ’s born . That means we ’re potentially committing to being married for up to a year or more . Maybe fifteen months . ”
13719	13729	13730	13730	I	0	“ I was assuming that would be the case , ”
13733	13742	13677	13677	she	79	“ I think anything less is suspicious anyway . ”
13751	13763	13743	13743	She	79	“ Should we discuss phase three ? The breakup and divorce ? ”
13764	13773	13677	13677	she	79	“ Already trying to get rid of me ? ”
13774	13787	13743	13743	She	79	“ The way I see it , there are two possible scenarios . ”
13788	13796	13743	13743	She	79	“ Go ahead . What are they ? ”
13797	13813	13814	13814	I	0	“ First , if I do n’t get pregnant , we can just blame that . ”
13819	13830	13814	13814	I	0	“ No way . Makes me an asshole , remember ? ”
13836	13907	13831	13831	She	79	“ I ’ll take the blame . Look , I ca n’t explain this fully , but infertility is really hard on women . It affects them in ways people who ’ve never been there ca n’t understand . But trust me when I say that it could have a detrimental effect on a marriage , especially one that was too rash and ill - advised in the first place . ”
13918	13921	13916	13916	her	79	“ Okay . ”
13922	13936	13937	13937	I	0	“ The second scenario is more complicated . If there is a baby . ”
13950	13975	13937	13937	I	0	“ Yeah , I agree . If I had n’t passed out last night , the thought of it would have kept me up . ”
13976	14003	13937	13937	I	0	“ This is the most serious part of this , because it ’s the part that ’s real , and the part that ’s actually forever . ”
14004	14007	14008	14008	My	0	“ Right . ”
14053	14081	14048	14048	Her	79	“ I want you to take some time to think about this , Enzo . This is n’t like a sperm donor situation . Because of our ‘ marriage’”—she
14088	14150	14048	14048	Her	79	again—“people will know you ’re the baby ’s father . Like I said before , I wo n’t ask anything of you , but if you want to co - parent with me , you can . We could work out custody and visitation arrangements . On the flip side , if you want to walk away completely , you can . ”
14163	14199	14158	14158	I	0	“ Fuck that . I ’m not an asshole , Bianca . If I father a child , I ’ll be its father . I ’m not a man who walks away from my responsibilities . ”
14200	14203	14161	14161	her	79	“ Okay . ”
14204	14216	14217	14217	I	0	“ And I told you . I ’ve always wanted kids , ”
14229	14273	14217	14217	I	0	“ I get that , but I just want you to take some time to think about whether or not you ’re ready for one at this point in your life , and with these circumstances . You will be a single dad . ”
14282	14299	14274	14274	I	0	“ I know . I said I was up for this , and I meant it . ”
14378	14396	14397	14397	Bianca	79	“ Okay . So this is the last thing I ’m going to say on this topic . ”
14402	14426	14397	14397	Bianca	79	“ I know you want to run your own company . But are you sure this is the only way to get it ? ”
14427	14442	14524	14524	she	360	“ Of course I ’m sure . That ’s what I ’ve been saying . ”
14443	14458	14459	14459	My	0	“ What about starting your own company ? Not taking over your father ’s . ”
14463	14517	14459	14459	My	0	“ Starting over from scratch ? Fuck that . This is my birthright , Bianca . I ’m the oldest Moretti son , and I deserve this , just like the previous five generations of oldest sons . I ’m just as worthy as the rest of them . I can prove it . ”
14518	14523	14524	14524	she	360	“ I believe you , ”
14536	14544	14524	14524	she	360	“ Good . Then it ’s settled . ”
14711	14715	14716	14716	she	79	“ Quit it , ”
14725	14732	14716	14716	she	79	“ You ’re creeping me out . ”
14733	14736	14740	14740	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
14768	14773	14774	14774	she	79	“ Want some coffee ? ”
14782	14785	14774	14774	she	79	“ Sure . ”
14797	14802	14803	14803	she	79	“ I ’m impressed , ”
14818	14822	14803	14803	she	79	“ Thank you . ”
14823	14835	14836	14836	I	0	“ I meant with your mother . You have nice manners . ”
14851	14873	14843	14843	she	79	“ Yeah , well , when she was n’t busy screaming at my father , she managed to raise polite kids . ”
14893	14902	14903	14903	she	79	“ You want to take some pasta home ? ”
14906	14915	14916	14916	She	79	“ Are you kidding ? Yes , please . ”
14936	14951	14916	14916	She	79	“ Do n’t forget to take it . It ’ll be in the fridge . ”
14952	14965	14916	14916	She	79	“ Okay . Thanks . Hey , can I use your bathroom ? ”
14966	14976	14916	14916	She	79	“ Sure . Around the corner on your right . ”
15225	15230	15231	15231	I	0	“ You get lost ? ”
15240	15256	15235	15235	Bianca	79	“ Just snooping in your office . Making sure you ’re not a secret psychopath . ”
15257	15276	15279	15279	I	0	“ I do n’t keep the bodies in my office , Enzo . Give me a little credit . ”
15288	15295	15279	15279	I	0	“ You like traveling , huh ? ”
15296	15310	15235	15235	Bianca	79	“ Love it . It ’s where I get all my design inspiration . ”
15311	15327	15235	15235	Bianca	79	“ What ’s your favorite place ? I should probably know this stuff about you . ”
15328	15332	15333	15333	She	79	“ Good point . ”
15359	15376	15377	15377	I	0	“ I ’d say Florence . No , the Amalfi Coast . No , maybe Capri . ”
15380	15391	15392	15392	She	79	“ I like a woman who gives a straight answer . ”
15397	15411	15392	15392	She	79	“ At least they ’re all in one country . What about you ? ”
15412	15429	15392	15392	She	79	“ I like Italy too . I ’d say Rome or Florence , for the architecture . ”
15430	15457	15392	15392	She	79	“ What do you know , we agree on something . If we were going on a real honeymoon , we could have gone to Italy . ”
15458	15463	15464	15464	I	0	“ Who ’s that ? ”
15485	15512	15513	15513	I	0	“ Oh , those are Grandma Vinnie ’s parents — my great - grandparents . Their last name was Lupo . They were married in 1923 . ”
15518	15532	15513	15513	I	0	“ So that ’s your great - grandmother ? You look like her . ”
15533	15558	15559	15559	I	0	“ You ’re just saying that because she ’s short . Everyone called her Tiny too . That ’s where my nickname comes from . ”
15562	15584	15559	15559	I	0	“ It ’s not just because she ’s short . It ’s her face too . The heart shape of it . ”
15605	15612	15613	15613	Bianca	79	“ She had red hair too , ”
15616	15660	15613	15613	Bianca	79	“ I mean , she died when I was only three , so I do n’t remember her , and her hair was white by then anyway , but I ’ve heard stories about her . Apparently , she was a real pistol . ”
15661	15665	15666	15666	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? ”
15679	15691	15666	15666	I	0	“ Your namesake was a pistol ? There ’s a surprise . ”
15700	15708	15694	15694	her	79	“ Do you know any family history ? ”
15709	15713	15714	15714	I	0	“ Very little , ”
15717	15748	15714	15714	I	0	“ I should ask my parents about it . Apparently my great - grandfather , the one I ’m named for , was into some sinister business . Mobster stuff . ”
15749	15763	15764	15764	Bianca	79	“ That ’s funny , because mine was too . They both were , ”
15774	15785	15764	15764	Bianca	79	“ They ran whisky into Detroit from Canada during Prohibition . ”
15786	15789	15790	15790	I	0	“ Seriously ? ”
15816	15837	15838	15838	Bianca	79	“ That ’s pretty cool . My great - grandfather lived in Detroit too . Maybe they knew each other . ”
15841	15865	15838	15838	Bianca	79	“ Would n’t that be something ? Come on , let ’s have coffee and dessert . I ’ve got a sweet tooth . ”
15866	15871	15872	15872	I	0	“ Good to know , ”
15902	15907	15908	15908	I	0	“ What ’s that ? ”
15940	15973	15974	15974	She	79	“ That ’s for us to draw up the most important rules of our deal . I figure we do n’t need everything in writing , maybe just the top five things . ”
15986	15995	15996	15996	she	79	“ I ’ll go first . No sex , ”
16021	16024	16016	16016	I	0	“ Fine . ”
16025	16029	16030	16030	she	79	“ With anyone , ”
16041	16064	16030	16030	she	79	“ Not as long as we ’re married . I do n’t want it going around that you ’re cheating on me . ”
16065	16081	16016	16016	I	0	“ Well , I do n’t want it going around that I ’m a cheater . ”
16082	16089	16090	16090	she	79	“ Good , then we agree , ”
16134	16140	16129	16129	I	0	“ Did you make these ? ”
16141	16144	16016	16016	I	0	“ Yes . ”
16145	16150	16016	16016	I	0	“ They ’re good . ”
16151	16163	16164	16164	I	0	“ Thank you . Okay , what ’s your top rule ? ”
16174	16180	16164	16164	I	0	“ Do n’t nag me . ”
16181	16184	16016	16016	I	0	“ What ? ”
16185	16234	16235	16235	I	0	“ My mother is always on my dad about every little thing — he got the floor dirty , he left the seat up , he forgot their anniversary , he did n’t make the dinner reservation , the volume on the TV is too loud . . . ”
16240	16250	16237	16237	my	0	“ It ’s like a constant stream of criticism . ”
16251	16258	16259	16259	she	386	“ Fair enough . No nagging , ”
16263	16270	16271	16271	I	0	“ Add something else to that , ”
16283	16343	16271	16271	I	0	“ Add that if something is really bothering you , you ’re going to tell me what it is and not expect me to guess at it like a mind reader . Like , you wo n’t go into a room and slam the door and make me wonder what I did wrong or what you ’re upset about . ”
16355	16366	16352	16352	I	0	“ Item two A , no mind - reading expectations . ”
16367	16374	16375	16375	I	0	“ Okay , what ’s next ? ”
16395	16410	16389	16389	Bianca	79	“ We have to be able to trust each other . So no lying . ”
16411	16423	16424	16424	I	0	“ Agreed . And no giving away the secret to anyone , ”
16428	16437	16424	16424	I	0	“ No one else can know about this . ”
16442	16448	16438	16438	She	386	“ I told my sister . ”
16449	16453	16389	16389	Bianca	79	“ You what ! ”
16454	16468	16469	16469	she	386	“ I told my sister , Ellie . But we can trust her , ”
16473	16512	16469	16469	she	386	“ Look , we ’re going to need support from people close to us . And I felt like Ellie was going to see through it anyway . Pick one friend or one of your siblings to tell . ”
16600	16609	16610	16610	I	0	“ I ca n’t choose between my friends , ”
16613	16620	16610	16610	I	0	“ How many are we talking ? ”
16621	16624	16625	16625	She	392	“ Three . ”
16628	16641	16625	16625	She	392	“ That ’s too many . Put their names in a hat . ”
16642	16645	16610	16610	I	0	“ Seriously ? ”
16646	16649	16650	16650	She	392	“ Yes . ”
16659	16664	16650	16650	She	392	“ Who are they ? ”
16694	16702	16703	16703	she	392	“ Close your eyes and pick one , ”
16774	16782	16783	16783	she	392	“ Well ? What does it say ? ”
16786	16789	16783	16783	she	392	“ Cole . ”
16793	16800	16783	16783	she	392	“ That ’s a great choice . ”
16801	16812	16783	16783	she	392	“ I ’m not sure . Cole sucks at lying . ”
16813	16832	16783	16783	she	392	“ We ’re not exactly asking him to lie . We ’re just trusting him with a secret . ”
16833	16837	16839	16839	her	392	“ I guess . ”
16852	16875	16846	16846	she	392	“ Number three : No lying to each other . Number four : No telling anyone except Ellie DeRossi and Cole Mitchell . ”
16876	16879	16783	16783	she	392	“ Fine . ”
16880	16902	16903	16903	I	0	“ Wait — what about their significant others ? Are we going to expect them not to tell Cheyenne or Sierra ? ”
16906	16932	16903	16903	I	0	“ I guess not . But that ’s it . The more people who know , the more likely it is the secret gets out . ”
16933	16936	16783	16783	she	392	“ Agreed . ”
16946	16980	16937	16937	Bianca	79	“ We need one more . We have no sex , no nagging or mind reading , no lying , no telling anyone outside the circle of trust . What can we add ? ”
16994	17002	17003	17003	I	0	“ No falling in love with me , ”
17017	17020	17013	17013	Her	79	“ What ? ”
17021	17026	17027	17027	Our	397	“ You heard me . ”
17042	17054	17039	17039	her	79	“ Wait a minute . That ’s a joke , right ? ”
17055	17088	17013	17013	Her	79	“ I ’m totally serious , Bianca . The one thing that could ruin this entire operation is if you get all hormonal and emotional , and you develop feelings for me . ”
17089	17092	17093	17093	she	79	“ Ha ! ”
17100	17104	17093	17093	she	79	“ Fat chance ! ”
17105	17111	17112	17112	I	0	“ Then write it down , ”
17123	17142	17143	17143	She	79	“ Oh , yes , of course . Let me get this down quickly , before I forget . ”
17149	17194	17146	17146	she	79	“ Special rule for Bianca : No falling in love with Enzo Moretti , and if you forget for one moment what a cocky , arrogant , egotistical , presumptuous , swaggering ass he is , just come back and look at this list . ”
17195	17201	17202	17202	I	0	“ Erase that last part , ”
17205	17209	17210	17210	she	79	“ No way , ”
17218	17298	17210	17210	she	79	“ Look , the only reason I want that in there is because I ’ve been in this situation before , okay ? Where I think a woman and I are on the exact same page , just hanging out and having fun , and then she suddenly gets feelings for me , and the fun is over . She starts expecting me to be someone else , and then I ’m an asshole when I do n’t change . ”
17299	17302	17303	17303	Bianca	79	“ Enzo , ”
17317	17339	17303	17303	Bianca	79	“ I promise , I know exactly who you are . And I will never expect you to be anybody else . ”
17378	17388	17367	17367	Cole	77	“ Wait a minute . What did you say ? ”
17389	17398	17399	17399	We	399	“ I ’m going to marry Bianca DeRossi . ”
17427	17430	17417	17417	I	0	“ When ? ”
17431	17446	17447	17447	He	398	“ Maybe a month or so . We do n’t want to rush it . ”
17470	17473	17447	17447	He	398	“ Why ? ”
17474	17502	17417	17417	I	0	“ So that my dad will give me Moretti & Sons . You know the condition — married and settled by age thirty - five or else . ”
17503	17511	17512	17512	Cole	77	“ I know , but . . . ”
17517	17532	17514	17514	his	398	“ Marrying Bianca ? That ’s fucking nuts . You ca n’t stand her . ”
17533	17550	17551	17551	I	0	“ It ’s only temporary . And besides , she ’s growing on me — slightly , ”
17580	17587	17561	17561	Cole	77	“ Temporary ? Like how long ? ”
17588	17609	17610	17610	Cole	77	“ Not that long . Maybe a year or so . Just long enough for the baby to be born . ”
17620	17623	17624	17624	I	0	“ Baby ! ”
17627	17648	17649	17649	He	398	“ Yeah . Bianca wants a baby . I need a wife . The pieces just sort of fit together . ”
17656	17667	17649	17649	He	398	“ I feel like I ’m in the Twilight Zone . ”
17668	17700	17649	17649	He	398	“ Look , we ’ve worked it all out . It ’s more of a business deal than anything else . We have a mission , a purpose , a plan . ”
17701	17736	17649	17649	He	398	“ Um , that plan includes the creation of another human being . Do you know what you ’re getting into ? And if you guys split , you ’ll still be a father . ”
17737	17741	17649	17649	He	398	“ I know . ”
17742	17752	17649	17649	He	398	“ A single father . It ’s not easy . ”
17841	17845	17846	17846	I	0	“ I know , ”
17849	17906	17846	17846	I	0	“ We ’ve talked about all this . And I ’ve thought about it . I think being a single dad sounds awesome . You get all of the perks of being a father without having to deal with a wife driving you nuts . You can do everything your way without any interference or arguing . ”
17907	17912	17913	17913	Cole	77	“ Or any help , ”
17920	17952	17917	17917	I	0	“ I ’ve got a mother and sisters if I need help . And there might not be a baby anyway . Bianca is n’t sure she can even get pregnant . ”
17953	17957	17846	17846	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
17958	17970	17971	17971	I	0	“ She ’s got some kind of problem with her eggs , ”
17991	18047	17986	17986	she	77	“ And it ’s only getting worse , so she wants to try getting pregnant sooner rather than later . She was going to use a sperm donor , but she said her family was totally against the idea and she did n’t love the thought of a total stranger being her baby ’s father . ”
18048	18057	17846	17846	I	0	“ But she loves the thought of you ? ”
18065	18091	18062	18062	his	406	“ This is just so weird . You guys do nothing but bicker and poke at each other when you ’re in the same room . ”
18092	18099	18100	18100	I	0	“ We ’re working on that , ”
18110	18125	18100	18100	I	0	“ And she apologized for the thing she said about my dick being small . ”
18126	18137	18138	18138	Cole	77	“ Well , I guess that ’s all that matters , ”
18143	18203	18138	18138	Cole	77	“ Listen , I know it sounds a little extreme , but she and I are in agreement on this . We each have a goal , and we ’re helping each other reach those goals . And when it ’s done , we ’ll part as friends and work out the arrangements for co - parenting the baby . ”
18210	18221	18222	18222	I	0	“ What we need from our friends is unconditional support , ”
18236	18261	18222	18222	I	0	“ We understand that this is n’t the way most people would go about getting what they want , but maybe most people are n’t as”—I
18265	18299	18138	18138	Cole	77	word—“as brave as we are . As determined . As willing to do whatever it takes to get where we want to be . We ’re not getting any younger , you know . ”
18300	18304	18305	18305	he	407	“ I know , ”
18308	18332	18305	18305	he	407	“ And good for you and for Griffin that you found the real thing with someone , but Bianca and I have n’t . ”
18338	18344	18333	18333	Cole	77	“ Have you even tried ? ”
18345	18352	18353	18353	I	0	“ That ’s not the point , ”
18363	18386	18353	18353	I	0	“ The point is that this is what we ’re doing , and we need our friends and family to support us . ”
18387	18398	18399	18399	He	407	“ You ’re going to tell your family the truth ? ”
18405	18431	18432	18432	Cole	77	“ Hell no ! The only people who will know the truth are Bianca ’s sister Ellie and you . That ’s in the contract . ”
18435	18461	18432	18432	Cole	77	“ Fuck , Moretti . You know I ’m shit at lying . My lip does that weird thing , and I get all sweaty . ”
18462	18470	18471	18471	I	0	“ You wo n’t have to lie , ”
18479	18494	18471	18471	I	0	“ You just have to keep a secret . And be excited for me . ”
18495	18503	18504	18504	he	407	“ I can manage that . Actually , ”
18515	18521	18504	18504	he	407	“ I might enjoy this . ”
18522	18525	18471	18471	I	0	“ Why ? ”
18526	18529	18530	18530	he	407	“ Because , ”
18536	18552	18530	18530	he	407	“ I know you . And her . She ’s going to drive you crazy . ”
18580	18584	18571	18571	he	407	“ You ready ? ”
18585	18590	18591	18591	Enzo	42	“ I think so . ”
18596	18609	18591	18591	Enzo	42	“ Do n’t be nervous . We ’re totally prepared for this . ”
18610	18614	18619	18619	his	407	“ Are we ? ”
18745	18780	18739	18739	Enzo	42	“ We are , Enzo . As far as our families know , we ’ve been dating for over a month . We spend all our time together . We ca n’t get enough . ”
18891	18894	18895	18895	he	424	“ Right , ”
18898	18904	18895	18895	he	424	“ Ca n’t get enough . ”
18905	18912	18913	18913	I	0	“ What ’s my middle name ? ”
18916	18923	18913	18913	I	0	“ Jane . What ’s mine ? ”
18924	18934	18895	18895	he	424	“ Thomas . Where did I go to college ? ”
18935	18947	18895	18895	he	424	“ Columbia . How long have I worked for my dad ? ”
18948	18963	18913	18913	I	0	“ Since you were fourteen . What instrument did I play in high school ? ”
18964	18978	18979	18979	I	0	“ Violin . What position do I play on the Bellamy Creek Bulldogs ? ”
18982	19000	18979	18979	I	0	“ Oh , yes . Ca n’t forget old man baseball . You ’re the second baseman . ”
19001	19007	19008	19008	he	426	“ And the fastest runner , ”
19011	19039	19040	19040	He	426	“ I stole home in the championship game against the Mason City Mavericks last year , which gave us the lead . We won by one run . ”
19059	19065	19066	19066	I	0	“ You are very fast , ”
19073	19079	19066	19066	I	0	“ Okay , what else ? ”
19086	19157	19080	19080	I	0	“ Your favorite food is a meatball sandwich , your favorite city is Rome , your favorite color is blue . You ’re good at math , you like books about architecture , you have an excellent memory . You speak some Italian , which I love . You like to bring me flowers , and I like cooking for you . You snore , but I do n’t mind . ”
19158	19164	19165	19165	Enzo	42	“ I do n’t snore ! ”
19171	19188	19165	19165	Enzo	42	“ And how would you know , anyway ? We ’ve never spent the night together . ”
19189	19202	19203	19203	I	0	“ Because we ’ve also discovered our shared old - fashioned values , ”
19207	19217	19203	19203	I	0	“ We do n’t believe in sex before marriage . ”
19223	19237	19218	19218	He	427	“ We ’re not going to say that out loud , are we ? ”
19238	19247	19248	19248	I	0	“ No . It will just be implied . ”
19252	19264	19248	19248	I	0	“ Now you go . What do you know about me ? ”
19278	19356	19265	19265	He	427	“ You have a sweet tooth and you sometimes eat cookies for breakfast — not that I ’ve seen you do it , of course . You ’re near - sighted , and without your glasses , you ’re blind as a bat . Your favorite flowers are white roses . Your great - grandparents were bootleggers . You love traveling , especially to Italy . You moved home from Chicago to be closer to your family . ”
19357	19362	19363	19363	I	0	“ That ’s good , ”
19366	19395	19363	19363	I	0	“ Work that in for sure . The importance of family is another belief we have in common . Also wanting to raise a family in Bellamy Creek . ”
19396	19399	19265	19265	He	427	“ Right . ”
19400	19410	19411	19411	He	428	“ Now what ’s something you love about me ? ”
19416	19421	19411	19411	He	428	“ Umm . . . ”
19422	19425	19426	19426	I	0	“ Enzo ! ”
19431	19436	19426	19426	I	0	“ I ’m thinking ! ”
19437	19453	19411	19411	He	428	“ Well , you need to think faster . We have to get in there . ”
19454	19457	19458	19458	He	428	“ Okay . ”
19463	19467	19458	19458	He	428	“ Your cooking . ”
19468	19471	19411	19411	He	428	“ And ? ”
19472	19495	19411	19411	He	428	“ You ’re good at your job . You work hard . I like that you started your own little design company . ”
19496	19508	19411	19411	He	428	“ Do n’t say it like that — it ’s patronizing . ”
19509	19512	19513	19513	he	428	“ Fine , ”
19519	19549	19513	19513	he	428	“ But I do n’t get what the big deal is . It ’s a design company . It ’s little . You only have one employee — yourself . ”
19550	19568	19569	19569	He	428	“ Never mind . Okay , what else ? There has to be a more personal thing . ”
19574	19586	19569	19569	He	428	“ No nagging , remember ? It ’s in the contract . ”
19587	19615	19513	19513	he	428	“ We ’re not married yet , and we wo n’t be if you ca n’t get this right . I get to nag for a moment . ”
19616	19622	19623	19623	He	428	“ Okay . More personal . ”
19629	19647	19623	19623	He	428	“ I like the way your butt looks in those jeans with the rip in the knee . ”
19659	19665	19654	19654	his	428	“ Less pervy , please . ”
19666	19683	19654	19654	his	428	“ It makes me laugh when you ’re too short to reach your high kitchen cabinets ? ”
19684	19690	19691	19691	I	0	“ Oh , forget it . ”
19696	19707	19708	19708	He	428	“ No , wait ! I can think of one . ”
19713	19723	19710	19710	his	428	“ You ’ve got what my dad calls moxie . ”

19728	19750	19654	19654	his	428	“ Yeah . It means courage . Determination . You can handle what comes at you and land on your feet . ”

19833	19837	19838	19838	he	428	“ Sugar pie ? ”
19852	19857	19838	19838	he	428	“ Ew . No . ”
19858	19861	19841	19841	he	428	“ Dollface ? ”
19862	19871	19841	19841	he	428	“ What is this , nineteen - twenty ? ”
19872	19884	19885	19885	He	428	“ Come on , I need to call you something cute . ”
19894	19900	19885	19885	He	428	“ I ’ve got it . ”

20549	20565	20529	20529	he	446	“ We already applied for a license . So hopefully within a week or two . ”
20566	20569	20570	20571	My mother	261	“ What ? ”
20580	20604	20577	20578	Mrs. Moretti	42	“ You ca n’t get married in a week or two . That ’s not enough time to send out all the invitations . ”
20605	20614	20615	20615	I	0	“ We want a small wedding , Mom , ”
20618	20628	20615	20615	I	0	“ Just us and two witnesses at City Hall . ”

21181	21191	21192	21193	her mother	230	“ I ’ll put it away in a minute , ”
21197	21206	21192	21193	her mother	230	“ I just need to message the priest . ”
21211	21214	21192	21193	her mother	230	“ What ? ”
21215	21241	21242	21242	Enzo	42	“ I ’m texting Father Mike . Just because you ’re getting married at City Hall does n’t mean he ca n’t bless your marriage . ”
21250	21259	21244	21244	I	0	“ That ’s a wonderful idea , Marisol , ”
21273	21286	21287	21287	I	0	“ We do n’t really want anything too , um , involved , ”

21391	21411	21384	21385	My mother	261	“ They ’re so in love , they just want to be husband and wife as soon as possible . ”
21412	21417	21421	21421	JJ	62	“ Why the rush ? ”
21423	21430	21421	21421	JJ	62	“ You knocked up or something ? ”
21431	21443	21444	21445	My mother	261	“ John Patrick DeRossi , what is the matter with you ? ”
21449	21455	21456	21456	I	0	“ I ’m not pregnant , ”
21463	21471	21456	21456	I	0	“ But you want children , right ? ”
21486	21492	21472	21473	Mrs. Moretti	42	“ Yes . We do . ”

21557	21608	21554	21554	she	42	“ Anyway , Ma , we really do n’t want a priest . I ’m already in touch with Judge Reinhart — we did a kitchen reno for him and his wife last year — and I ’m just waiting for him to get back to me with a date . ”
21609	21613	21614	21615	Mr. Moretti	102	“ James Reinhart ? ”
21618	21650	21614	21615	Mr. Moretti	102	“ I ’ll call him tomorrow . We gave him a great deal on that home renovation , and he said if I ever needed anything to give him a call . ”
21655	21669	21651	21651	Enzo	42	“ Pop , we ’ve got this . You do n’t need to — ”
21670	21675	21676	21677	Mr. Moretti	102	“ Consider it done , ”
21682	21698	21676	21677	Mr. Moretti	102	“ I ’ll get that wedding date for you by the end of the week . ”
21731	21742	21720	21720	I	0	“ Thanks , Mr. Moretti . We ’d appreciate that . ”
21743	21752	21756	21756	Eve	83	“ So Enzo , how did you propose ? ”
21772	21778	21779	21779	I	0	“ It was very romantic , ”
21801	21810	21779	21779	I	0	“ He even got down on one knee . ”
21811	21816	21818	21818	Cat	85	“ Where were you ? ”
21820	21825	21826	21826	I	0	“ At my condo , ”
21829	21834	21835	21835	Lynne	40	“ Were you surprised ? ”
21838	21843	21844	21844	Enzo	42	“ She was shocked . ”
21858	21878	21850	21850	he	477	“ Shocked and delighted . She could n’t say yes fast enough . And she cried tears of joy . ”
21922	21929	21930	21930	I	0	“ It was quite the surprise , ”
21936	21943	21944	21944	Talia	84	“ I ’m sure it was , ”
21949	21964	21944	21944	Talia	84	“ Whoever thought Enzo would be the type to get down on one knee ? ”
21965	21971	21972	21972	I	0	“ Both knees , actually , ”
21983	22025	22026	22026	Enzo	42	“ Almost like he was begging me to spend the rest of our lives together . He just kept saying over and over again how much he loved me . How he ca n’t wait for me to be his wife . ”
22034	22044	22045	22045	he	481	“ You ’re just so lovable , mia polpetta , ”
22058	22074	22045	22045	he	481	“ Once I got past your prickly surface , I discovered a truly big heart . ”
22075	22099	22100	22100	I	0	“ And once I realized there was more to you than your big fat ego , I could n’t help falling in love . ”
22106	22120	22100	22100	I	0	“ In fact , I find your insufferable arrogance sort of charming now . ”
22121	22143	22144	22144	he	481	“ And I find your know - it - all attitude and general air of imperious self - importance downright entrancing , ”
22160	22176	22148	22148	He	481	“ I am so bewitched by you , sweetheart , I can hardly see straight . ”
22186	22196	22183	22183	her	60	“ Wow . Clearly you were meant to be . ”
22197	22200	22201	22201	I	0	“ Clearly , ”
22318	22327	22328	22329	My mother	261	“ Aww , now is n’t that sweet ? ”
22338	22353	22334	22334	her	261	“ You two are going to be together forever . I just know it . ”
22375	22382	22383	22383	she	1940	“ Ladies ’ room , please , ”
22391	22400	22401	22401	I	0	“ I ’ll be right back , honey , ”

22487	22512	22513	22513	She	60	“ Oh my God ! I ca n’t believe you guys are going through with this . Look at me . I ’m sweating . ”
22528	22565	22525	22525	I	0	“ Relax . It ’s going great . Mom and Dad are so happy , they ’re not even questioning the fact that we ’re obviously rushing into something that will be a big fat mistake . ”
22579	22585	22586	22586	Ellie	60	“ Neither are the Morettis , ”
22589	22594	22586	22586	Ellie	60	“ Except maybe Pietro . ”
22595	22625	22645	22645	his	488	“ Well , he ’s about to lose the opportunity to be head of the family firm . Understandable why he might be reluctant to offer his heartiest congrats . ”
22626	22641	22645	22645	his	488	“ Mr. Moretti seems a bit quiet too . Think he ’s got doubts ? ”
22662	22682	22654	22654	his	488	“ Hard to say for sure , but he certainly volunteered to reach out to the judge quickly enough . ”
22683	22694	22645	22645	his	488	“ Maybe he expected you guys to argue against it . ”
22695	22705	22706	22706	We	483	“ Hopefully , he noticed that we did n’t . ”
22723	22735	22736	22736	She	491	“ We do n’t see any reason to push it back . ”
22745	22787	22742	22742	her	491	“ I still ca n’t believe you guys are going through with it . At least you ’re marrying someone hot . Sometimes it ’s hard to look away from his face . And I ’m not even attracted to men . ”
22801	22809	22788	22788	I	0	“ He ’s handsome . I agree . ”
22810	22819	22742	22742	her	491	“ Do you guys get along at all ? ”
22820	22823	22788	22788	I	0	“ Nope . ”
22835	22879	22826	22826	I	0	“ I mean , we ’re learning better how to fake it , and occasionally I get this glimmer of appreciation or maybe even gratitude for him , but then he says something truly loathsome and I remember why he ’s the worst . ”
22891	22913	22880	22880	She	492	“ I do n’t know , you have pretty good chemistry . Sparks were definitely flying between you at the table . ”
22914	22921	22922	22922	I	0	“ For all the wrong reasons , ”
22926	22935	22922	22922	I	0	“ Our chemistry is not the good kind . ”
22939	22958	22936	22936	She	492	“ Sparks are sparks . And it would not surprise me at all if eventually something catches fire . ”
22967	22971	22959	22959	I	0	“ Not happening . ”
22980	22993	22975	22975	her	492	“ You ’re telling me you ’re not attracted to him whatsoever ? ”
22994	22997	22975	22975	her	492	“ Nope . ”
23018	23036	23037	23037	She	492	“ Plus we ’ve agreed there will be no messing around . It ’s in the contract . ”
23042	23050	23037	23037	She	492	“ You guys actually made a contract ? ”
23051	23062	23063	23063	I	0	“ Yes . We had to lay the ground rules , ”
23077	23086	23063	23063	I	0	“ So what was that kiss out there ? ”
23116	23122	23104	23104	her	492	“ That was for show . ”
23123	23129	23151	23151	her	492	“ Looked real to me . ”
23130	23148	23104	23104	her	492	“ That ’s because I ’m a good actress . Let ’s get back to the table . ”
23167	23180	23181	23181	she	492	“ You know , you ’re really not that good an actress , ”
23188	23192	23181	23181	she	492	“ Just saying . ”
23262	23269	23270	23270	Enzo	42	“ What the hell was that ? ”
23282	23299	23300	23300	I	0	“ That was our engagement dinner . I thought it went well , by the way , ”
23307	23321	23322	23322	He	494	“ I meant that kiss . What the fuck was up with that ? ”
23354	23380	23381	23381	He	494	“ Kissing is something a real couple would do at their engagement dinner , do n’t you think ? I was trying to be authentic . ”
23417	23432	23405	23405	His	494	“ You were the one who said no kissing allowed , and I agreed . ”
23433	23436	23437	23437	I	0	“ Sorry , ”
23443	23455	23437	23437	I	0	“ I did n’t realize it would bother you so much . ”
23456	23486	23405	23405	His	494	“ It ’s not that it bothered me . I was just . . . unprepared . I think we need to agree on that stuff ahead of time . ”
23507	23564	23501	23501	I	0	“ Enzo , if we ’re going to fake being in love , we ’re going to have to do things couples in love do when we ’re in front of other people . It ’s part of the act . I mean , we ’re going to have to kiss at the ceremony , right ? ”
23565	23570	23571	23571	he	494	“ That ’s different , ”
23574	23588	23571	23571	he	494	“ That ’s expected . This was unexpected . And it threw me . ”
23589	23596	23597	23597	I	0	“ Okay , okay . Sheesh . ”
23605	23619	23597	23597	I	0	“ I ’ll give you a warning next time , how ’s that ? ”
23620	23644	23645	23645	He	494	“ I do n’t need a warning , Bianca . Now that I know that kissing is approved , I ’ll be fine . ”
23651	23668	23645	23645	He	494	“ I did n’t realize you ’d have such a hard time controlling yourself around me . ”
23673	23698	23645	23645	He	494	“ I do n’t have a hard time controlling myself around you , Enzo . I told you , I was playing the game . ”
23699	23702	23703	23703	he	494	“ Right , ”
23707	23711	23703	23703	he	494	“ The game . ”
23722	23743	23744	23744	He	494	“ Speaking of unapproved moves , what was all that BS about me crying tears of joy when you proposed ? ”
23747	23773	23774	23774	he	494	“ That ’s what girls are supposed to do when they ’re happy , is n’t it ? I was just trying to be authentic , ”
23784	23800	23774	23774	he	494	“ You were n’t being authentic , you were being obnoxious . My prickly surface ? ”
23801	23820	23821	23821	He	494	“ Listen , you were n’t any better , telling them I begged you to be my wife . ”
23832	23848	23829	23829	his	494	“ Please . I ’ve never begged a woman to do anything in my life . ”
23849	23871	23872	23872	He	494	“ That was before . Now that you ’re in love with me , everything is different . You definitely begged . ”
23907	23915	23916	23916	I	0	“ Listen , let ’s not fight , ”
23919	23951	23916	23916	I	0	“ We ’ve got issues to deal with . Do you think your dad can really get the judge to give us a wedding date by the end of the week ? ”
23952	23962	23963	23963	He	494	“ Probably . My dad can be very persuasive . ”
23969	23979	23963	23963	He	494	“ So we should be prepared to move fast . ”
23980	23983	23984	23984	He	494	“ Okay . ”
23995	24013	23984	23984	He	494	“ If you ’re going to back out , Bianca , do it now . Last chance . ”
24027	24039	24018	24018	I	0	“ If you ’re still in , I ’m still in . ”
24040	24057	24058	24058	Enzo	42	“ I ’m still in . We should talk about where we ’re going to live , ”
24061	24067	24058	24058	Enzo	42	“ My place or yours . ”
24068	24083	24084	24084	Enzo	42	“ Oh yeah . I guess one of us has to move , huh ? ”
24087	24106	24084	24084	Enzo	42	“ Uh , yes . I do n’t think it would be too convincing if we lived separately . ”
24142	24175	24182	24182	he	494	“ Your place is bigger . I suppose it makes more sense . But I hate to give up my condo . . . eventually I ’m going to need it back . ”
24176	24181	24182	24182	he	494	“ So keep it , ”
24185	24191	24182	24182	he	494	“ Let JJ live there . ”
24198	24234	24182	24182	he	494	“ I guess . But I ’ll have to kick him out when I need to move back in . I do n’t want to live with him or be stuck with nowhere to go . ”
24235	24246	24247	24247	Enzo	42	“ You wo n’t have nowhere to go , Bianca . ”
24253	24284	24247	24247	Enzo	42	“ Do you think I ’d put you out on the street with our baby ? If it comes to it , I can always go stay at Beckett ’s . ”
24291	24305	24306	24306	He	502	“ Really ? You ’d move out of your own house for me ? ”
24309	24312	24306	24306	He	502	“ Sure . ”
24313	24316	24317	24317	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
24348	24358	24343	24343	I	0	“ Thanks for the ride . And for dinner . ”
24371	24376	24359	24359	Enzo	42	“ You ’re welcome . ”
24392	24405	24377	24377	I	0	“ Do you want to come in for a drink or something ? ”
24406	24412	24359	24359	Enzo	42	“ I guess I could . ”
24413	24417	24418	24418	I	0	“ No pressure , ”
24422	24434	24418	24418	I	0	“ If you ’ve got other plans , it ’s fine . ”
24435	24440	24441	24441	he	502	“ No other plans , ”
24458	24476	24441	24441	he	502	“ I ’m just surprised you ’d want to spend any more time with me than necessary . ”
24477	24487	24488	24488	I	0	“ I ’m trying to get used to you , ”
24491	24513	24488	24488	I	0	“ It ’s like exposure therapy . And pretty soon , all our Saturday nights are going to be spent together . ”
24514	24519	24520	24520	he	502	“ Ca n’t wait , ”
24549	24555	24529	24529	he	502	“ You got any whiskey ? ”
24556	24574	24575	24575	He	502	“ I do , in fact . And I make a mean Manhattan if you ’re interested . ”
24583	24588	24575	24575	He	502	“ I ’m interested . ”
24620	24626	24611	24611	I	0	“ Then come on in . ”
24629	24636	24637	24637	Bianca	79	“ What should we drink to ? ”
24657	24667	24668	24668	I	0	“ To a long and happy life — apart , ”
24955	24961	24962	24962	she	79	“ Flip any houses lately ? ”
24965	24971	24962	24962	she	79	“ Not really . You ? ”
24972	25040	25041	25041	She	79	“ Not in a while . I was working with a friend in Chicago who was sort of the money behind the deals — I did all the legwork , supervised the renovations , and then I turned it over to a real estate agent friend to make the sale — but the friend in Chicago lost big on a few risky stock investments and pulled back . ”
25044	25062	25041	25041	She	79	“ And I knew I needed to save up for fertility treatments . They ’re not cheap . ”
25063	25067	25068	25068	I	0	“ Got it . ”
25076	25084	25068	25068	I	0	“ Did you like living in Chicago ? ”
25085	25131	25041	25041	She	79	“ I did , believe it or not . I never really thought of myself as a city girl , and I hated the traffic , but I did like the convenience of having lots of shopping and dining options right there in my neighborhood . ”
25132	25140	25141	25141	She	79	“ Where in Chicago did you live ? ”
25184	25208	25209	25209	Her	79	“ When I first moved down there , I lived on campus . Then I had an apartment with a girlfriend in Bucktown . ”
25216	25240	25213	25213	her	79	“ But for the last four years , I lived with my boyfriend downtown . He had a condo on Lake Shore Drive . ”
25241	25244	25245	25245	I	0	“ Fancy , ”
25265	25269	25260	25260	She	79	“ It was . ”
25270	25282	25213	25213	her	79	“ Four years , huh ? That ’s a long time . ”
25283	25291	25292	25292	I	0	“ We were actually together for five . ”
25296	25302	25292	25292	I	0	“ What was his name ? ”
25303	25307	25213	25213	her	79	“ Tate DuCharme . ”
25317	25322	25323	25323	She	79	“ So what happened ? ”
25391	25401	25402	25402	she	79	“ What happened was that I was an idiot , ”
25409	25446	25402	25402	she	79	“ I believed his lies , I let him convince me he just needed more time , and I turned a blind eye to all the signs he would never be ready for a lifetime commitment . ”
25447	25455	25405	25405	her	79	“ Why ’d you do all that ? ”
25456	25462	25463	25463	Her	79	“ Because I loved him . ”
25491	25514	25487	25487	her	79	“ And I wanted him to love me back the same way . But no amount of wanting could make that true . ”
25515	25523	25524	25524	I	0	“ But he must have loved you , ”
25527	25538	25524	25524	I	0	“ Why else would he date you for five years ? ”
25549	25567	25539	25539	She	79	“ Maybe he loved me . But not enough . And what ’s the use of that ? ”
25575	25657	25568	25568	I	0	“ He always had some condition that had to be met , or some goal he had to reach , before he could think about the next phase of his life — getting married and having a family , which is what he said he ultimately wanted . For a while , it was turning thirty , then it was making partner at his firm , then it was landing this certain big client , then it was closing the case . ”
25663	25708	25660	25660	her	79	“ But there was always another big client and the next big case . I realized I was never going to come first . And then I realized that it was all lies anyway — he was sleeping with a woman at his firm . ”
25709	25716	25717	25717	I	0	“ Seriously ? What a prick . ”
25753	25762	25740	25740	I	0	“ And she probably was n’t the first . ”
25763	25770	25771	25771	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Bianca , ”
25787	25845	25771	25771	I	0	“ The worst thing was , even after that came to light , I went to him and said , ‘ Last chance . If you want a life with me , it starts now . ’ And he said he was n’t willing to give up the life he had for the future we ’d planned . ”
25846	25849	25860	25860	him	512	“ Fuck . ”
25862	25868	25869	25869	She	514	“ What did you do ? ”
25878	25908	25869	25869	She	514	“ I left him that night and went to stay with a friend . Quit my job the next day . Two weeks later , I moved back here . ”
25909	25923	25869	25869	She	514	“ You did the right thing . That asshole did n’t deserve you . ”
25924	25932	25933	25933	she	514	“ Thanks . So what about you ? ”
25972	25977	25968	25968	I	0	“ What about me ? ”
26022	26030	26031	26031	She	514	“ What ’s been your longest relationship ? ”
26042	26046	26047	26047	She	514	“ Define relationship . ”
26050	26069	26047	26047	She	514	“ It ’s a thing where you date one person exclusively for a somewhat lengthy period of time . ”
26070	26073	26074	26074	I	0	“ Hmm . ”
26079	26102	26103	26103	She	514	“ I believe there was a girl in high school that I drove home from school every day for like four months . ”
26110	26122	26103	26103	She	514	“ That ’s not a relationship , that ’s a carpool . ”
26123	26151	26152	26152	Her	514	“ If her parents were n’t home , sometimes she ’d invite me in and give me a hand job in her bedroom . Does that help ? ”
26156	26164	26152	26152	Her	514	“ No . You ’re a pig . ”
26165	26175	26176	26176	I	0	“ Oh relax , I actually liked that girl . ”
26183	26190	26176	26176	I	0	“ And I returned the favor . ”
26191	26195	26196	26196	Her	514	“ Did you ? ”
26204	26224	26225	26225	She	514	“ Of course I did . I ’m a gentleman and a feminist . I always return a favor . ”
26245	26250	26235	26235	her	514	“ What about Juliet ? ”
26251	26254	26196	26196	Her	514	“ Who ? ”
26255	26272	26225	26225	She	514	“ Juliet . The one who blew you in the parking lot after the Romeo audition . ”
26273	26278	26235	26235	her	514	“ What about her ? ”
26279	26286	26196	26196	Her	514	“ Did you return that favor ? ”
26287	26300	26225	26225	She	514	“ Not in the parking lot . But yes , I did . ”
26301	26304	26235	26235	her	514	“ Interesting . ”
26305	26311	26312	26312	She	514	“ Why ’s that interesting ? ”
26315	26330	26312	26312	She	514	“ I do n’t know . Some guys do n’t like returning that favor . ”
26331	26337	26338	26338	She	514	“ Some guys are idiots . ”
26352	26359	26349	26349	her	514	“ Are you good at it ? ”
26367	26370	26349	26349	her	514	“ Huh ? ”
26371	26378	26379	26379	Her	514	“ Are you good at it ? ”
26384	26401	26379	26379	Her	514	“ I mean , what if I want to brag about your sexual prowess or something ? ”
26402	26406	26349	26349	her	514	“ To who ? ”
26407	26413	26414	26414	Her	514	“ I do n’t know . ”
26418	26423	26424	26424	Recovering	111	“ Girls talk sometimes . ”
26436	26460	26429	26429	I	0	“ Well , you can safely brag about my talent in that capacity . I know my way around a woman ’s orgasm . ”
26461	26465	26466	26466	She	514	“ Do you ? ”
26489	26507	26508	26508	Her	514	“ Yes . I ’m patient , intuitive , and very , very good with my tongue . ”
26523	26535	26518	26518	she	514	“ And with my lips , my hands , and my — ”
26536	26543	26544	26544	she	514	“ Okay , that ’s enough , ”
26555	26571	26544	26544	she	514	“ It ’s getting late , and I have to get up for church tomorrow . ”
26572	26575	26576	26576	I	0	“ Same . ”
26601	26612	26613	26613	She	514	“ And a gentleman knows when to make his exit . ”
26633	26639	26640	26640	I	0	“ Thanks for the drink , ”
26662	26667	26668	26668	She	514	“ You ’re welcome . ”
26687	26696	26697	26697	I	0	“ You know , I could stay over , ”
26701	26711	26697	26697	I	0	“ Keep you nice and warm all night long . ”
26712	26715	26716	26716	she	514	“ Nope , ”
26727	26732	26716	26716	she	514	“ Goodnight , Enzo . ”
26747	26751	26733	26733	I	0	“ No kiss ? ”
27422	27426	27427	27427	I	0	“ Get out , ”
27448	27459	27427	27427	I	0	“ Get out and stay out , you redheaded siren . ”
27777	27783	27784	27784	Her	79	“ What ’s this for ? ”
27799	27804	27805	27805	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , ”
27825	27834	27835	27835	She	79	“ Sorry . Thank you — they’re beautiful . ”
27850	27860	27835	27835	She	79	“ It just surprised me , that ’s all . ”
27861	27923	27924	27924	I	0	“ Why should it surprise you ? I know how you love fresh flowers , and I know white roses are your favorite . Plus , it was a good opportunity for people to see me doing something romantic . I parked sort of far away from the florist so everyone would see me walking down the sidewalk carrying the roses . ”
27935	27941	27942	27942	She	79	“ I ’m always thinking . ”
27951	27960	27945	27945	she	79	“ Ah , so it was for show . ”
27961	27969	27970	27970	I	0	“ Is n’t everything ? Smells good , ”
27981	27987	27970	27970	I	0	“ What are we having ? ”
27988	27992	27993	27993	I	0	“ Meatball sandwiches . ”
27996	28000	27993	27993	I	0	“ My favorite . ”
28001	28011	28012	28012	she	79	“ I know . Want to pour some wine ? ”
28021	28031	28012	28012	she	79	“ There are a few bottles in the rack . ”
28032	28035	28036	28036	I	0	“ Sure . ”
28043	28068	28036	28036	I	0	“ I ’ll even get the glasses down from the high cupboard for you . Hey , I should put that in my vows . ”
28069	28075	28012	28012	she	79	“ What do you mean ? ”
28076	28114	28115	28115	I	0	“ Well , I talked to Judge Reinhart today , and he said the official part of the ceremony is pretty quick and impersonal , so if we wanted to add any personal vows , we could . ”
28125	28134	28115	28115	I	0	“ And you want to add personal vows ? ”
28149	28160	28161	28161	I	0	“ I thought it might be more convincing that way , ”
28165	28171	28161	28161	I	0	“ You might be right . ”
28185	28196	28172	28172	She	79	“ Thanks again for the roses . I love them . ”
28197	28202	28203	28203	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . ”
28211	28220	28203	28203	I	0	“ I also talked to my father today . ”
28225	28234	28221	28221	Her	79	“ Oh yeah ? What did he say ? ”
28235	28251	28172	28172	She	79	“ He said he ’s having paperwork drawn up to name me as his successor . ”
28252	28255	28256	28256	She	79	“ Cheers . ”
28272	28285	28256	28256	She	79	“ Want to make the sandwiches while I put together some antipasto ? ”
28286	28289	28172	28172	She	79	“ Sure . ”
28290	28312	28172	28172	She	79	“ The broiler is ready . I usually stick the rolls in there with a few slices of provolone before I — ”
28313	28324	28325	28325	She	79	“ I know how to make a sandwich , Bianca . ”
28328	28333	28325	28325	She	79	“ Do your thing . ”
28349	28358	28359	28359	I	0	“ Did you tell your family about Friday ? ”
28365	28370	28362	28362	She	79	“ My mother cried . ”
28371	28375	28376	28376	I	0	“ Mine too . ”
28395	28406	28376	28376	I	0	“ By the way , our reception begins at six . ”
28407	28410	28411	28411	she	79	“ Nice , ”
28414	28419	28411	28411	she	79	“ Where is it ? ”
28420	28432	28376	28376	I	0	“ The Bulldog Pub . We rented out the back room . ”
28437	28447	28433	28433	Her	79	“ My wedding reception is at the Bulldog Pub ? ”
28448	28469	28470	28470	She	79	“ Listen , princess , we had to call in a favor to get it , so do n’t complain . ”
28473	28493	28470	28470	She	79	“ Fine . The Bulldog it is . I need to figure out what I ’m going to wear . ”
28494	28497	28433	28433	Her	79	“ Same . ”
28504	28515	28498	28498	I	0	“ This is really fucking good , by the way . ”
28516	28529	28470	28470	She	79	“ Thank you . I think you should wear a black suit . ”
28530	28537	28538	28538	She	79	“ Okay . What color tie ? ”
28550	28553	28538	28538	She	79	“ Red . ”
28554	28557	28470	28470	She	79	“ Done . ”
28558	28568	28569	28569	I	0	“ I guess I ’ll get a white dress . ”
28572	28591	28569	28569	I	0	“ Sounds good to me . Do you want another ring ? Like a wedding band or something ? ”
28592	28595	28596	28596	she	79	“ Nah , ”
28599	28611	28612	28612	I	0	“ One ring is good enough . You want a ring ? ”
28615	28625	28612	28612	I	0	“ I ’d wear a ring , I guess . ”
28626	28639	28470	28470	She	79	“ Okay . I ’ll get you one . What about food ? ”
28640	28668	28669	28669	She	79	“ I talked to the Bulldog owner . We ’re working it out . If you want to take over the menu planning , be my guest . ”
28672	28689	28669	28669	She	79	“ I ’ll go over there tomorrow . We ’ll keep it simple . Open bar ? ”
28690	28694	28470	28470	She	79	“ Probably easiest . ”
28695	28710	28470	28470	She	79	“ So who ’s coming to this party ? Did you invite anyone today ? ”
28711	28721	28722	28722	I	0	“ Griffin . Cole . Beckett . My family . ”
28725	28750	28722	28722	I	0	“ I told my mother no aunts and uncles , no cousins . She claimed they were never going to speak to her again . ”
28763	28769	28756	28756	she	79	“ What did you say ? ”
28770	28780	28781	28781	She	79	“ I said , ‘ You ’re welcome . ’ ”
28833	28849	28850	28850	she	79	“ What the hell ? It ’s like we ’re not in love or something , ”
28853	28866	28850	28850	she	79	“ Maybe we should just let the judge do all the talking . ”
28888	28910	28876	28876	She	79	“ No , I like the idea of personal vows . I think you ’re right about it being more authentic . ”
28911	28921	28922	28922	I	0	“ Maybe we should write them for each other , ”
28925	28931	28922	28922	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
28932	28958	28964	28964	her	79	“ I mean , you get to come up with a couple things you want me to say , and I ’ll do the same . ”
28967	28980	28964	28964	her	79	“ And we have to say what the other person has written ? ”
28981	28992	28922	28922	I	0	“ Sure . Just do n’t make it too long . ”
28993	29002	29003	29003	she	79	“ I ’ll keep it short and sweet , ”
29006	29012	29003	29003	she	79	“ But not too sweet . ”
29024	29032	29014	29014	I	0	“ Do n’t make me sound ridiculous . ”
29033	29038	29039	29039	she	79	“ I wo n’t , ”
29044	29070	29039	29039	she	79	“ I ’m just going to make you sound in love with me . You can do the same thing . It ’ll be fun . ”
29071	29074	29014	29014	I	0	“ Fun ? ”
29075	29080	29081	29081	She	79	“ Oh come on . ”
29089	29119	29081	29081	She	79	“ What if this is the only wedding either one of us ever has ? Do n’t we deserve to hear our soul mate say nice things about us ? ”
29120	29133	29134	29134	She	79	“ But it wo n’t be real . It ’s made up . ”
29137	29145	29134	29134	She	79	“ It ’s what we ’ve got . ”
29171	29181	29167	29167	she	79	“ Thanks for the flowers . I appreciate them . ”
29182	29187	29188	29188	I	0	“ Thanks for dinner , ”
29211	29215	29216	29216	She	79	“ Any time . ”
29223	29257	29216	29216	She	79	“ I like cooking for people who love to eat . My ex was always on a health kick — didn’t eat carbs , did n’t eat dairy , did n’t eat sugar . ”
29263	29271	29272	29272	She	79	“ What ’s the point of living ? ”
29275	29278	29272	29272	She	79	“ Right ? ”
29279	29284	29272	29272	She	79	“ Well , goodnight . ”
29285	29288	29289	29289	I	0	“ Night . ”
29442	29450	29451	29451	I	0	“ They still do that volcano project ? ”
29464	29481	29482	29482	He	542	“ Yep . And it makes just as big a mess as when we did it . ”
29488	29501	29482	29482	He	542	“ Bet you ’ll be doing that same project in ten years . ”
29515	29518	29502	29502	I	0	“ Maybe . ”
29519	29524	29482	29482	He	542	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
29525	29528	29529	29529	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
29542	29551	29552	29552	Cole	77	“ Just a lot going on this week . ”
29555	29580	29552	29552	Cole	77	“ No shit . You ’re getting married in two days . I had to trade my Saturday off in order to be there . ”
29581	29584	29482	29482	He	542	“ Sorry . ”
29585	29603	29604	29604	Cole	77	“ Hey , I was joking . You know I do n’t care about the day off . ”
29611	29617	29604	29604	Cole	77	“ What ’s going on ? ”
29629	29649	29618	29618	I	0	“ It ’s not a big deal . Bianca just said something yesterday that put me in a funk . ”
29650	29671	29482	29482	He	542	“ Do n’t let it get to you . You guys know exactly how to push each other ’s buttons . ”
29672	29678	29482	29482	He	542	“ It ’s not that . ”
29679	29690	29691	29691	Cole	77	“ Then what is it ? What did she say ? ”
29698	29763	29691	29691	Cole	77	“ We ’re writing each other ’s vows — don’t ask , it was my stupid idea , which I now regret — and when I warned her not to go overboard , she said something like , ‘ What if this is the only wedding either one of us ever has ? Do n’t we deserve to hear nice things about ourselves ? ’ ”
29768	29771	29764	29764	Cole	77	“ Okay . ”
29772	29811	29691	29691	Cole	77	“ And it just made me , I do n’t know , sad or something . She ’s throwing away her one chance to hear someone say why he wants to spend his life with her on me . ”
29812	29820	29821	29821	I	0	“ So say nice things about her . ”
29830	29838	29824	29824	He	546	“ But I wo n’t mean them . ”
29839	29848	29691	29691	Cole	77	“ So ? It ’s what she wants . ”
29849	29858	29859	29859	I	0	“ Something about it does n’t feel right , ”
29868	29907	29863	29863	Cole	77	“ Moretti , you are marrying this girl on Friday afternoon . Not because you love her , but so that you can inherit your family business . And you ’re worried about the three - minute vows ? ”
29908	29925	29926	29926	I	0	“ When you put it that way , I guess it does sound kind of stupid , ”
29929	29975	29926	29926	I	0	“ I do n’t think it ’s stupid that you do n’t want to say things you do n’t mean — I think it ’s admirable . But realistically , you are faking this relationship . It always involved a measure of dishonesty , right ? ”
29976	29979	30061	30061	his	548	“ Right . ”
29980	29989	30061	30061	his	548	“ And you ’re not lying to Bianca . ”
29990	30008	29926	29926	I	0	“ No . We ’re open about everything . We know exactly what we ’re getting into . ”
30032	30058	30059	30059	He	548	“ Then you have to trust each other . She chose this too , after all . She picked you to have a child with . ”
30072	30080	30061	30061	his	548	“ That ’s a big fucking deal . ”
30081	30084	30085	30085	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
30102	30108	30085	30085	I	0	“ Did you tell Cheyenne ? ”
30109	30128	30061	30061	his	548	“ I did . I do n’t keep big stuff from her . I hope that was okay . ”
30129	30134	30135	30135	I	0	“ It ’s fine . ”
30139	30147	30135	30135	I	0	“ Does she think it ’s crazy ? ”
30148	30159	30160	30160	He	548	“ Yes . But she ’s weirdly happy about it . ”
30167	30175	30164	30164	his	548	“ I think she just likes weddings . ”
30176	30183	30184	30184	I	0	“ This one should be interesting . ”
30189	30208	30184	30184	I	0	“ I can not imagine what Bianca is going to make me say about her during those vows . ”
30212	30224	30209	30209	Cole	77	“ What are you going to make her say about you ? ”
30225	30232	30234	30234	my	0	“ I have no fucking idea . ”
30242	30254	30237	30237	I	0	“ But do n’t worry , I ’ll make it good . ”
30257	30267	30274	30274	her	261	“ That ’s it . That ’s the one , ”
30292	30309	30310	30311	my sister	1940	“ Mom , you ’ve said that about every dress she ’s tried on so far , ”
30339	30347	30348	30348	I	0	“ I kind of like this one , ”
30465	30477	30479	30480	the saleswoman	556	“ That ’s a great choice for a bride your size , ”
30488	30494	30479	30480	the saleswoman	556	“ Sorry I ’m late ! ”
30555	30560	30544	30544	she	115	“ Oh my God . ”
30561	30567	30568	30568	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
30574	30579	30580	30580	She	115	“ I love it . ”
30588	30606	30607	30607	She	115	“ It ’s sweet , it ’s elegant , it ’s fun , it suits your personality . ”
30610	30615	30607	30607	She	115	“ It ’s perfect . ”
30616	30622	30623	30623	I	0	“ I like it too . ”
30629	30636	30623	30623	I	0	“ But is it too formal ? ”
30637	30642	30643	30643	Blair	115	“ Not at all , ”
30647	30656	30643	30643	Blair	115	“ Honey , this is your wedding dress , ”
30661	30667	30643	30643	Blair	115	“ It should be formal . ”
30668	30701	30643	30643	Blair	115	“ But I ’m getting married at City Hall , Mom . And my reception is at the Bulldog Pub . We ’ll be eating sliders and fries and drinking boxed wine . ”
30702	30711	30712	30712	Blair	115	“ And it ’s going to be amazing , ”
30728	30747	30720	30720	She	115	“ It does n’t even need to be altered , which is a sure sign from the universe . ”
30748	30757	30643	30643	Blair	115	“ Then I guess this is the one . ”
30764	30768	30758	30758	I	0	“ Unzip me ? ”
30769	30786	30787	30787	Anita	114	“ Wait , you ’re not even going to try on any of the other ones ? ”
30791	30808	30787	30787	Anita	114	“ You ’ve only tried on three . Most brides try on at least a dozen . ”
30809	30816	30818	30819	my sister	1940	“ She ’s not most brides , ”
30832	30839	30824	30824	I	0	“ Still . Are you sure ? ”
30849	30871	30840	30840	Anita	114	“ I ’m sure . My wedding is on Friday , so I do n’t really have a lot of time . ”
30872	30877	30878	30878	she	1940	“ That ’s true , ”
30881	30896	30878	30878	she	1940	“ And this is stunning on you . Should we try a little veil ? ”
30897	30900	30901	30901	I	0	“ No , ”
30905	30909	30901	30901	I	0	“ No veil . ”
30910	30916	30917	30917	Anita	114	“ Just a short one ? ”
30922	30939	30919	30919	her	114	“ Give me one minute . I have the perfect thing . It just came in . ”
30955	30976	30977	30977	I	0	“ The dress is so beautiful , Bianca . Enzo is going to lose his marbles when he sees you . ”
30980	30994	30977	30977	I	0	“ Thanks . Nothing I like more than making Enzo lose his marbles . ”
30995	31009	31010	31010	she	115	“ It ’s just amazing the way you two fell for each other , ”
31019	31033	31010	31010	she	115	“ To think , you ’ve known each other almost your entire lives . ”
31034	31044	31045	31046	my mother	261	“ Is n’t it romantic and old - fashioned ? ”
31067	31072	31062	31062	Her	261	“ Stop , Mom . ”
31124	31128	31129	31129	Anita	114	“ This one ! ”
31175	31183	31184	31184	Anita	114	“ It ’s called a birdcage veil , ”
31187	31199	31184	31184	Anita	114	“ It ’s a vintage style , but very trendy again . ”
31200	31205	31206	31206	Blair	115	“ Oh , Bianca , ”
31209	31219	31206	31206	Blair	115	“ It ’s so beautiful with your red hair . ”
31220	31226	31227	31227	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
31249	31255	31246	31246	she	1940	“ It ’s perfect , B. ”
31311	31322	31323	31323	I	0	“ Anyone up for a glass of wine after this ? ”
31326	31340	31323	31323	I	0	“ I have to go over to the pub to finalize the menu . ”
31341	31345	31346	31346	Blair	115	“ I am , ”
31350	31372	31346	31346	Blair	115	“ I want to hear the whole proposal story from start to finish . Griffin was absolutely useless on the details . ”
31373	31390	31391	31392	my mother	261	“ I wish I could , but I have to get home and feed your father , ”
31399	31409	31395	31395	Ellie	60	“ Sorry , I have to get home too . ”
31440	31451	31452	31452	she	569	“ I wish I could get married all over again , ”
31455	31467	31468	31468	I	0	“ At City Hall ? With your reception at the Bulldog ? ”
31478	31511	31512	31512	She	569	“ Yes ! I would n’t care . Do n’t get me wrong , I loved my wedding at Cloverleigh Farms , but it wo n’t matter where you are , Bianca . ”
31524	31560	31512	31512	She	569	“ The only thing that will matter is hearing Enzo promise to love , honor , and cherish you for the rest of your life . And getting to make the same promise right back . ”
31566	31569	31512	31512	She	569	“ Yeah . ”
31708	31714	31715	31715	I	0	“ I ’ll take it , ”
31718	31721	31715	31715	I	0	“ Done . ”
31850	31891	31892	31892	I	0	“ Cheers . I ’m so happy for you , honey . I do n’t blame you one bit for not wanting to wait to get married . When you know , you know . Now show me that ring . ”
31908	31913	31914	31914	she	115	“ Oh , Bianca , ”
31918	31946	31914	31914	she	115	“ It ’s beautiful . The stone is big but not ostentatious , it ’s a classic setting , and yellow gold is so stylish right now . ”
31954	31960	31961	31961	I	0	“ It ’s not real , ”
31964	31967	31961	31961	I	0	“ What ? ”
31973	31982	31968	31968	Blair	115	“ You mean it ’s a fake diamond ? ”
31983	31990	31914	31914	she	115	“ It ’s a fake engagement . ”
31991	32004	31968	31968	Blair	115	“ I do n’t understand . You ’re not really getting married ? ”
32005	32030	32031	32031	I	0	“ No , we ’re getting married . That part is real . And as far as I know , the diamond is real . ”
32036	32043	32031	32031	I	0	“ But everything else is fake . ”
32044	32054	31968	31968	Blair	115	“ But . . . I do n’t understand . ”
32055	32060	32061	32061	I	0	“ Drink some wine , ”
32072	32083	32061	32061	I	0	“ You ’re going to need it for this story . ”
32145	32153	32136	32136	I	0	“ So you ’re not in love ? ”
32163	32170	32171	32171	I	0	“ No , we ’re not . ”
32180	32203	32171	32171	I	0	“ I think we might like each other a little better at this point , but we are definitely not in love . ”
32208	32214	32204	32204	She	115	“ This is so depressing . ”
32215	32219	32220	32220	I	0	“ Not really , ”
32236	32266	32220	32220	I	0	“ We ’re doing this for one another . We ’re going to get exactly what we want in the end . No one is going to get hurt . ”
32267	32273	32204	32204	She	115	“ But I ’m hurt . ”
32286	32300	32282	32282	she	115	“ Maybe you ’ll fall in love for real once you ’re married ! ”
32301	32309	32310	32310	I	0	“ Good God , I hope not , ”
32317	32321	32310	32310	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
32322	32348	32282	32282	she	115	“ This plan works specifically because we ’re not in love . Phase three would be a disaster if one of us had real feelings . ”
32362	32366	32282	32282	she	115	“ Phase three ? ”
32367	32374	32375	32375	I	0	“ The plan has three phases , ”
32404	32435	32396	32396	I	0	“ We ’re in phase one right now — that ’s the engagement and wedding . The marriage and getting pregnant is phase two . The breakup is phase three . ”
32436	32453	32454	32454	she	115	“ But if you really fell in love , you would n’t have to break up , ”
32463	32487	32458	32458	I	0	“ We will not be in love , Blair . We ’re not like you and Griffin . This is a business arrangement . ”
32488	32492	32396	32396	I	0	“ But maybe — ”
32493	32496	32497	32497	I	0	“ No , ”
32505	32581	32497	32497	I	0	“ I do n’t think you understand — I do n’t want to fall for Enzo . I was in love with someone in Chicago for five years , and it was toxic and terrible and tore me apart . It took me a long time to feel whole again , and now that I do , I do n’t plan on giving anyone that kind of power over me , especially not Enzo Moretti . ”
32588	32603	32582	32582	She	585	“ I ’m really sorry about the bad relationship . I did n’t know . ”
32604	32620	32621	32621	I	0	“ I do n’t talk about it much . And it does n’t matter now . ”
32626	32710	32621	32621	I	0	“ Sorry I got testy . I do n’t love discussing my romantic past . But I ’m never going to be hurt like that again . Because I realized I do n’t need a man for what I really want — to be a mom . To raise a child . There is nothing between Enzo and me except some bad blood and a contract — which , by the way , I have just violated by telling you the whole truth . ”
32711	32717	32718	32718	she	586	“ My lips are sealed , ”
32721	32736	32718	32718	she	586	“ I wo n’t even tell Griff if you do n’t want me to . ”
32742	32755	32737	32737	I	0	“ I hate asking you to keep a secret from your husband . ”
32756	32774	32775	32775	she	586	“ In this particular case , I do n’t think he ’d want to know the truth , ”
32778	32784	32775	32775	she	586	“ So we ’re okay . ”
32785	32788	32789	32789	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
32814	32822	32823	32823	She	586	“ You think this is a mistake ? ”
32834	32874	32823	32823	She	586	“ I do n’t know . My gut reaction was shock , but honestly I feel like people have probably gotten married for worse reasons . At least you two are being completely honest with each other about things . ”
32875	32879	32891	32891	her	586	“ We are . ”
32880	32888	32889	32889	She	586	“ Then who am I to judge ? ”
32894	32967	32891	32891	her	586	“ I think women have to be bold sometimes to get what they want . Be adventuresome . Think outside the box . I know I had to . And it was n’t easy for me — I’d been raised to do what I was told , what was expected of me . Instead , I struck out on my own and did things my way . And look at me now . ”
32968	32973	32974	32974	I	0	“ I ’m looking , ”
32978	33014	32974	32974	I	0	“ And I ’ve always admired your independent spirit . Someday , I hope to feel that way too — like I can look back without regret on the day I became Mrs. Enzo Moretti . ”
33015	33019	32891	32891	her	586	“ Excuse me , ”
33028	33036	33037	33037	I	0	“ Did you say Mrs. Enzo Moretti ? ”
33096	33099	33100	33100	I	0	“ Yes . ”
33105	33123	33100	33100	I	0	“ You must be Reina . I ’ve heard so much about you . I ’m Bianca . ”
33129	33144	33145	33145	I	0	“ Are you his — so you ’re like — did you marry him ? ”
33148	33160	33145	33145	I	0	“ Not yet . We ’re tying the knot this Friday . ”
33170	33174	33145	33145	I	0	“ This Friday ? ”
33175	33239	33240	33240	I	0	“ Yes . I know , it seems fast . We only reconnected after the two of you stopped seeing one another . But years ago , we were deeply in love . High school sweethearts , in fact . We only broke up when I left for college . When we started up again , it was like no time had passed . ”
33245	33252	33240	33240	I	0	“ Instant rekindling of the flame . ”
33253	33261	33262	33262	she	587	“ He wanted to marry me too , ”
33288	33300	33282	33282	She	587	“ In fact , he proposed with that very same ring . ”
33301	33336	33337	33337	I	0	“ Well , thank God you do n’t know a good thing when you see it , or else I would n’t be marrying the love of my life in two days , right ? ”
33345	33387	33337	33337	I	0	“ Well , I should get home — he ’s got dinner waiting , and I ’m starved . Although he ’s such an animal , he probably wo n’t even let me eat before he starts tearing my clothes off . ”
33388	33395	33396	33396	Reina	46	“ He tears your clothes off ? ”
33406	33414	33400	33400	her	46	“ Constantly . The man is insatiable . ”
33474	33482	33470	33470	Enzo	42	“ Could we get our bill please ? ”
33483	33491	33499	33499	Blair	115	“ I ’ve got this , Bianca . ”
33508	33518	33499	33499	Blair	115	“ You go on home to your insatiable fiancé . ”
33519	33524	33525	33525	I	0	“ Thanks , Blair . ”
33530	33554	33525	33525	I	0	“ I ’ll talk to you later . Lovely to meet you , Reina ! Maybe we ’ll see you here Friday night . ”
33555	33563	33499	33499	Blair	115	“ I ’m not working Friday night . ”
33564	33580	33525	33525	I	0	“ What a bummer ! Well , maybe we ’ll see you around . Ta ! ”
33633	33642	33629	33629	he	597	“ What the hell ? You mean Reina ? ”
33643	33646	33649	33649	I	0	“ Yes . ”
33656	33672	33649	33649	I	0	“ She ’s super hot . Why did n’t you want to bang her again ? ”
33673	33686	33629	33629	he	597	“ I just did n’t , okay ? What did she say ? ”
33687	33712	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ Well , she overheard me talking about the wedding , and she was confused , since you had proposed to her so recently . ”
33716	33780	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ Do n’t worry , I made it all work . I told her how we ’d been high school sweethearts back in the day — I figured she was in diapers that long ago , anyway — and thank goodness she rejected your suit , because that opened the door for our magical reunion and now all is as it should be . ”
33781	33787	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ And she bought it ? ”
33788	33820	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ As far as I know . I ’m pretty sure she was too busy being offended that you never touched her but you ca n’t keep your hands off me . ”
33821	33831	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ What the fuck ? Who told her that ? ”
33832	33836	33837	33837	I	0	“ I did , ”
33842	33849	33837	33837	I	0	“ And it was really fun . ”
33860	33867	33854	33854	he	598	“ I bet she was pissed . ”
33868	33900	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ I think baffled is a more fair assessment . I could see the wheels spinning , like she was trying to figure out what I have that she does n’t . ”
33901	33904	33713	33713	Enzo	42	“ Ha . ”
33905	33924	33854	33854	he	598	“ Seriously , Enzo . The girl is stunning . Why did n’t you want to bang her ? ”
33925	33931	33932	33932	He	598	“ I do n’t know . ”
33938	33948	33932	33932	He	598	“ She just did n’t do anything for me . ”
33949	33952	33953	33953	I	0	“ Oh . ”
33960	33987	33953	33953	I	0	“ Or maybe I was too preoccupied to think about sex , worrying about how I was going to get my dad to change his mind . ”
33988	33992	33993	33993	I	0	“ Problem solved , ”
33997	34010	33993	33993	I	0	“ Not really . I just traded one problem for another one . ”
34011	34017	33932	33932	He	598	“ How do you mean ? ”
34018	34057	33953	33953	I	0	“ Well , I ’m meeting with my dad and his lawyer tomorrow to sign all the paperwork transferring majority ownership of Moretti & Sons to me , but I ’ll be celibate for at least a year . ”
34058	34064	34065	34065	I	0	“ Oh . That problem . ”
34080	34094	34065	34065	I	0	“ Well , it ’s a problem we ’ll share , at least . ”
34095	34102	33953	33953	I	0	“ Will you even miss it ? ”
34103	34106	33953	33953	I	0	“ Sex ? ”
34107	34117	34118	34118	My	0	“ Is n’t that what we ’re talking about ? ”
34136	34147	34125	34125	I	0	“ Yes . But hopefully I ’ll be pregnant soon . ”
34148	34158	33953	33953	I	0	“ What does that have to do with it ? ”
34159	34170	34171	34171	I	0	“ My body will be . . . otherwise engaged , ”
34174	34190	34171	34171	I	0	“ I ’ll be too busy growing a human to worry about satisfying selfish needs . ”
34191	34206	33953	33953	I	0	“ Is that really what you think ? That sex is a selfish need ? ”
34207	34220	33953	33953	I	0	“ You do n’t think there ’s something selfish about sexual gratification ? ”
34221	34244	34245	34245	I	0	“ No . Because I always make sure whoever I ’m with is gratified first and fully before I think about myself . ”
34252	34255	34245	34245	I	0	“ Oh . ”
34256	34280	34245	34245	I	0	“ Sex is n’t selfish , Bianca . People are selfish . And it sounds like you ’ve only been with selfish people . ”
34281	34289	34290	34290	I	0	“ There have n’t been that many , ”
34352	34391	34346	34346	he	66	“ Whatever . I ’m not one to judge someone for their sexual behavior — no , I take it back . I judge those assholes you were with who made you think sex was a selfish act . ”
34392	34402	34403	34403	I	0	“ Maybe it ’s my old Catholic guilt talking , ”
34409	34458	34403	34403	I	0	“ When you spend all those years being taught by nuns , you grow up associating sex outside marriage — or even taking pleasure in it — with sin and shame . It took some time for me to unlearn that stuff and be okay with enjoying myself . ”
34459	34468	34346	34346	he	66	“ Clearly I did not attend Catholic schools . ”
34469	34509	34346	34346	he	66	“ Well , I think it ’s something they mostly emphasize to girls . I used to think you could get pregnant if you lay down next to a man in bed , even if you were fully clothed . ”
34510	34526	34403	34403	I	0	“ Jesus . We ’re not sending our kid to Catholic schools , are we ? ”
34534	34549	34346	34346	he	66	“ I ’m not sure . I have n’t thought that far ahead yet . ”
34550	34565	34346	34346	he	66	“ Yeah , I guess we do n’t need to worry about it now . ”
34566	34602	34346	34346	he	66	“ What we do need to worry about is when I ’m moving in with you . People are going to think it ’s weird if we get married and I still live here alone . ”
34603	34606	34346	34346	he	66	“ Right . ”
34607	34669	34670	34670	Enzo	42	“ JJ is all set to move in here . My parents love the idea because they ’re so sick of him living at home . They even offered to pay half his rent . If he ’d quit all the stupid trips to Vegas and betting on sports , he ’d be able to afford a place of his own . ”
34673	34694	34670	34670	Enzo	42	“ Yeah , some guys are like that . Okay , so why do n’t we move you in Saturday ? ”
34695	34698	34670	34670	Enzo	42	“ Okay . ”
34716	34723	34707	34707	I	0	“ We ’ll be married then . ”
34724	34732	34670	34670	Enzo	42	“ You ’re right . We will . ”
34774	34791	34770	34770	Enzo	42	“ You can have your own bedroom here . I ’ll clean out the guest room . ”
34808	34818	34770	34770	Enzo	42	“ Is that . . . is that okay ? ”
34819	34836	34764	34764	he	601	“ Sure . I do n’t have many guests anyway . Will you need an office ? ”
34837	34847	34848	34848	I	0	“ I can get along without a home office , ”
34851	34869	34848	34848	I	0	“ Should I rent a truck or do you think we can get everything here in cars ? ”
34870	34901	34764	34764	he	601	“ I do n’t think we ’ll need a truck . It will mostly just be clothes and books . I ’ll leave my furniture and kitchen stuff for JJ . ”
34902	34910	34764	34764	he	601	“ Great . So Saturday , then . ”
34911	34914	34915	34915	I	0	“ Saturday . ”
34921	34936	34915	34915	I	0	“ What are we going to do about the , um , wedding night ? ”
34937	34943	34944	34944	Enzo	42	“ Oh yeah . That . ”
34947	34974	34944	34944	Enzo	42	“ Maybe you should plan on staying over here that night . I do n’t want people to see me dropping you off at your condo . ”
34975	34988	34944	34944	Enzo	42	“ Right . Okay . I’ll — I’ll pack an overnight bag . ”
34989	34993	34944	34944	Enzo	42	“ Sounds good . ”
35014	35022	35005	35005	I	0	“ So have you written my vows ? ”
35023	35031	35032	35032	he	603	“ I worked on them a little , ”
35035	35040	35032	35032	he	603	“ What about you ? ”
35041	35049	34944	34944	Enzo	42	“ I wrote a few things down . ”
35054	35066	35051	35051	I	0	“ I really can not wait to hear you say them . ”
35070	35088	35067	35067	He	603	“ Please remember that my guy friends are going to be there . Do n’t emasculate me . ”
35089	35097	35101	35101	his	603	“ I would n’t dream of it . ”
35120	35129	35114	35114	I	0	“ But I have to tell you something . ”
35130	35133	35134	35134	I	0	“ What ? ”
35139	35145	35134	35134	I	0	“ I broke a rule . ”
35146	35156	35114	35114	I	0	“ Let me guess . You told someone else . ”
35157	35162	35163	35163	I	0	“ I ’m sorry ! ”
35172	35178	35163	35163	I	0	“ It just came out ! ”
35182	35187	35179	35179	He	603	“ Who was it ? ”
35188	35191	35114	35114	I	0	“ Blair . ”
35192	35195	35196	35196	He	603	“ Oh . ”
35204	35212	35196	35196	He	603	“ Is she going to tell Griffin ? ”
35213	35231	35114	35114	I	0	“ She said she would n’t . She said he probably would n’t want to know anyway . ”
35232	35240	35114	35114	I	0	“ Yeah . I could see that . ”
35241	35263	35196	35196	He	603	“ Anyway , I apologize . If you want to tell one more person to make it even , you can . ”
35264	35280	35281	35281	I	0	“ Nah . The fewer people that know this is n’t real , the better . ”
35291	35294	35281	35281	I	0	“ Right . ”
35295	35311	35196	35196	He	603	“ And Cole told me Cheyenne knows . So we ’re even , I guess . ”
35312	35321	35196	35196	He	603	“ Cheyenne knows ? What does she think ? ”
35322	35350	35351	35351	I	0	“ She has a twisted mind . She thinks it ’s romantic , like two people getting married so one of them can stay in the country . ”
35354	35361	35351	35351	I	0	“ I suppose it ’s similar . ”
35409	35420	35421	35421	he	605	“ Well , I guess I ’ll hit the sack , ”
35424	35429	35421	35421	he	605	“ Night , Lucy . ”
35433	35438	35430	35430	I	0	“ Night , Ricky . ”
35850	35857	35858	35858	Blair	115	“ Then do it for you , ”
35861	35874	35858	35858	Blair	115	“ Not everything has to be for a man . Pamper yourself ! ”
35875	35880	35881	35881	I	0	“ I heartily agree , ”
37075	37081	37082	37082	he	78	“ How do you feel ? ”
37085	37099	37082	37082	he	78	“ Okay . I ’ll feel better after a few sips of that . ”
37201	37207	37195	37195	she	79	“ monochromatic and somewhat cold . ”
37245	37248	37249	37249	he	78	“ Shit , ”
37252	37262	37249	37249	he	78	“ Was I supposed to wear a red one ? ”
37273	37282	37283	37283	Griffin	76	“ No dress code . You ’re good . ”
37302	37307	37308	37308	he	76	“ Is this okay ? ”
37311	37332	37308	37308	he	76	“ I was n’t sure how dressy we were supposed to be , and Blair was n’t home to ask . ”
37333	37338	37339	37339	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
37343	37352	37339	37339	I	0	“ This really is n’t a formal thing . ”
37353	37360	37361	37361	Beckett	78	“ It ’s still your wedding , ”
37364	37372	37361	37361	Beckett	78	“ That ’s a big fucking deal . ”
37373	37377	37378	37378	Griffin	76	“ No shit . ”
37386	37407	37378	37378	Griffin	76	“ I ’m still trying to wrap my head around it . You sure you did n’t knock her up ? ”
37474	37486	37487	37487	Griffin	76	“ For fuck ’s sake , Moretti . I was kidding . ”
37492	37503	37487	37487	Griffin	76	“ Lighten up . Married life is n’t so bad . ”
37504	37510	37511	37511	I	0	“ It ’s not that , ”
37546	37551	37552	37552	he	78	“ Let ’s toast , ”

37633	37650	37629	37629	he	78	“ This wedding . The relationship . Bianca and me . It ’s just an act . ”
37651	37656	37657	37657	Griffin	76	“ What ? Why ? ”
37666	37670	37671	37671	he	78	“ Your dad , ”

37743	37746	37747	37747	Beckett	78	“ What ? ”
37753	37758	37747	37747	Beckett	78	“ Why would she — ”
37759	37766	37767	37767	Cole	77	“ Because she wants a baby . ”

37881	37960	37874	37875	no one	1757	“ I ’m sorry , you guys . I wanted to tell you all right from the start , which was only about a month ago , but Bianca and I promised each other we ’d keep it to ourselves . As you can imagine , it ’s not something we want getting out . Especially to our parents . I only got to tell one person , and I drew Cole ’s name out of a hat . ”
37961	37971	37972	37972	Cole	77	“ I ’m glad you said something to everyone , ”
37978	37992	37972	37972	Cole	77	“ And if this is what you want , then we support you . ”

38020	38025	38026	38026	I	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
38030	38070	38026	38026	I	0	“ I know it ’s fucking crazy . But it ’s what we both agreed to do to get the things we want . And I have always wanted to be a father . That part is real enough . ”
38071	38079	38080	38080	Beckett	78	“ And the marriage will be real ? ”
38083	38108	38080	38080	Beckett	78	“ Yes . It ’s more of a business arrangement than anything else — we’re just friends — but we are really getting married . ”
38130	38135	38136	38136	Beckett	78	“ Well , then . ”

38989	39019	38986	38986	I	0	“ My father gave them to her on their wedding day . They were his mother ’s before that — a gift from her father , the original Enzo . ”

39369	39391	39366	39366	she	79	“ Sorry . I had nowhere else to put them . I typed everything out and taped them to the card . ”
39392	39395	39366	39366	she	79	“ Okay . ”
39412	39421	39402	39402	I	0	“ And you ’ll go first , right ? ”
39422	39425	39426	39426	She	79	“ Right . ”
39440	39447	39426	39426	She	79	“ Why am I so nervous ? ”
39448	39459	39460	39460	Our	685	“ I am too . But we ’ll be fine . ”
39464	39497	39498	39498	She	79	“ And listen , I just want to say thanks for doing this . It means a lot to me . I know you do n’t really want to be my wife . ”
39502	39528	39498	39498	She	79	“ You ’re welcome . Thanks for agreeing to be my child ’s father . I know it is n’t what you ’d have chosen . ”
39529	39536	39537	39537	I	0	“ That does n’t matter anymore , ”
39554	39577	39578	39578	She	79	“ I ’m going to take care of you , Bianca . And the baby . I want you to know that . ”
39611	39653	39603	39603	Ellie	60	“ What the hell , you guys ? We did n’t know where you went . Judge Reinhart says you ’re up . Dad ’s waiting for you out here , B. Everyone else is seated up in the courtroom already . ”
39654	39659	39660	39660	Bianca	79	“ Okay , sorry . ”
39666	39669	39660	39660	Bianca	79	“ Ready ? ”
39676	39684	39685	39685	Ellie	60	“ Ready . See you in there . ”

39722	39727	39728	39728	He	689	“ A little sweaty . ”
39731	39753	39728	39728	He	689	“ I think that ’s normal . I guess I meant , are you still sure you want to do this ? ”
39798	39801	39802	39802	I	0	“ Yes , ”
40209	40212	40213	40213	I	0	“ Hey , ”

40559	40616	40617	40617	She	79	“ You are the best thing that ever happened to me . I do n’t know why I was so mean to you when we were kids . I think now I was afraid of the way I felt for you . I had never met anyone so good - looking and awesome at baseball before . ”
40631	40700	40617	40617	She	79	“ I ca n’t wait to spend the rest of my life ironing your shirts and cooking your favorite foods and watching you win the Allegan County Senior Men ’s Baseball Championship year after year . It is my dream come true . P.S. I wo n’t even care if you snore because it is such a manly sound . I love everything about you and always will . ”
40725	40732	40735	40735	her	79	“ That was beautiful , sweetheart , ”
40746	40750	40751	40751	she	79	“ Your turn , ”
40782	40827	40828	40828	I	0	“ My sweet , brilliant , beautiful Bianca , what can I say but that my life before you was a meaningless , shallow void — in the words of the immortal Edward Cullen , it was ‘ an unending , unchanging midnight . ’ ”
40849	40926	40927	40927	I	0	“ You have brought light into the egotistical and immature darkness that was my soul . I see now that you were always my one true love , and I was just too wrapped up in myself to commit to anyone else . But no longer . To sum up , again I quote Edward Cullen : ‘ No measure of time with you will be long enough , but we ’ll start with forever . ’ ”
40954	40968	40950	40950	She	79	“ That was lovely , Enzo . Brought a tear to my eye . ”
40969	40974	40976	40977	Judge Reinhart	104	“ Well , then , ”
40980	41007	40976	40977	Judge Reinhart	104	“ By the authority vested in me by the State of Michigan , I now pronounce you husband and wife . You may kiss the bride . ”
41076	41091	41070	41071	the judge	438	“ Ladies and gentlemen , I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Enzo Moretti . ”
41207	41216	41217	41217	Bianca	79	“ Take good care of her , son , ”
41228	41234	41217	41217	Bianca	79	“ I will , sir . ”
41295	41302	41303	41303	he	744	“ Please . Call me Dad , ”
41313	41319	41303	41303	he	744	“ We ’re family now . ”
41320	41323	41324	41324	I	0	“ Okay . ”
41328	41331	41324	41324	I	0	“ Dad . ”
41396	41404	41393	41393	I	0	“ I ’m tempted to drop you . ”
41410	41421	41405	41405	She	753	“ I ’m tempted to kick you in the balls . ”
41500	41513	41514	41514	She	79	“ Egotistical and immature ? What the hell was that all about ? ”
41520	41569	41514	41514	She	79	“ Please . It was not worse than having to say all that nonsense about how mean I was , or how good - looking and awesome at baseball you are . Or that it ’s my dream come true to iron your shirts and attend your games . ”
41570	41578	41514	41514	She	79	“ Who the fuck is Edward Cullen ? ”
41579	41590	41591	41591	she	79	“ He ’s only the most romantic character ever written , ”
41604	41613	41599	41599	I	0	“ Let me guess — a teenage vampire . ”
41614	41626	41627	41627	she	79	“ Well , technically he ’s over a hundred years old , ”
41630	41660	41627	41627	she	79	“ But yes , he appears to be a teenager . And Cheyenne and Blair thought it was very sweet that you quoted my favorite book during your vows . ”
41661	41668	41669	41669	I	0	“ You quoted your favorite book , ”
41678	41694	41669	41669	I	0	“ Will you relax ? Everything went fine , Enzo . We pulled it off . ”
41695	41699	41627	41627	she	79	“ I guess . ”
41700	41715	41716	41716	I	0	“ We ’re married , are n’t we ? Boom — phase one complete . ”
41734	41739	41740	41740	she	79	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
41746	41749	41743	41743	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
41750	41777	41778	41778	I	0	“ Something is wrong . You ’re doing the thing with your finger on your chin , and that vein is popping out on your forehead . ”
41816	41824	41809	41809	I	0	“ It was something your dad said . ”
41825	41840	41783	41783	she	79	“ What ? That you could n’t return me ? I ’m final sale ? ”
41841	41858	41787	41787	her	79	“ No . He called me son and told me to take good care of you . ”
41859	41862	41863	41863	she	79	“ Oh , ”
41867	41882	41863	41863	she	79	“ I said I would . And then he said to call him Dad . ”
41892	41899	41883	41883	I	0	“ Well , that was nice . ”
41900	41946	41947	41947	Bianca	79	“ Yeah , but it ’s all bullshit , Bianca . I ’m thinking like , in a year , this man is going to despise me . He ’s going to think I ’m not a man of my word . That bothers me . ”
41952	42002	41947	41947	Bianca	79	“ Good grief , Enzo . You need to relax . This is n’t 1955 . I do n’t need a man to take care of me . My dad ’s just old - fashioned . And when we split up , I ’ll make sure he understands that . ”
42003	42010	42011	42011	She	79	“ Still does n’t feel right . ”
42015	42030	42011	42011	She	79	“ Well , it ’s too late now . We ’re married , Ricky . ”
42048	42051	42052	42052	she	79	“ Hey , ”
42066	42148	42052	42052	she	79	“ We knew what we were getting into when we made this deal . I know it ’s not conventional , but what is marriage anyway ? Maybe it ’s just an illusion perpetuated by Disney movies and romance novels . Maybe it ’s just a piece of paper . Maybe it ’s just an antiquated idea that reeks of misogyny and sexism — I mean , the bride ’s dad gives her away like she ’s a piece of property ! ”
42160	42167	42149	42149	I	0	“ That seems kind of harsh . ”
42168	42213	42214	42214	She	79	“ Do n’t get me wrong , I bought into the fantasy all my life . I was waiting for the handsome prince to decide on me , but he did n’t . He did n’t , Enzo . So I decided on me . ”
42231	42238	42228	42228	her	79	“ But I need your help . ”
42239	42246	42247	42247	I	0	“ I need your help too . ”
42262	42274	42275	42275	She	79	“ Sorry , I do n’t know what my problem is . ”
42281	42362	42275	42275	She	79	“ It ’s okay . Look , it ’s been a crazy week . Things happened fast , and our heads are spinning . You probably have n’t gotten much sleep — I know I have n’t . So let ’s go in and have a few drinks , eat some fried pickles , and celebrate our partnership with our friends and family . So what if it ’s not exactly the kind of partnership they all think it is ? ”
42363	42369	42370	42370	I	0	“ Uh , about that . ”
42373	42385	42370	42370	I	0	“ I kind of let the truth slip to my friends . ”
42386	42389	42390	42390	She	79	“ Enzo ! ”
42396	42399	42390	42390	She	79	“ Who ? ”
42400	42416	42275	42275	She	79	“ Cole already knew , so really just two more people — Griffin and Beckett . ”
42423	42432	42417	42417	She	79	“ They know to keep it to themselves ? ”
42433	42444	42390	42390	She	79	“ Yes . And I trust them with my life . ”
42445	42451	42452	42452	She	79	“ Then I will too . ”
42455	42466	42452	42452	She	79	“ So let ’s go face the music and dance . ”
42469	42474	42475	42475	I	0	“ You did what ? ”
42492	42508	42475	42475	I	0	“ We got you a night in the honeymoon suite at the Bellamy Creek Inn . ”
42513	42520	42509	42510	My mother	261	“ It ’s your wedding present . ”
42670	42672	42674	42675	Frank Sinatra	124	“ Witchcraft ”
42784	42798	42799	42799	I	0	“ We — we had n’t really planned on a honeymoon or anything , ”
42802	42811	42799	42799	I	0	“ We ’re both so busy with work . ”
42812	42830	42831	42832	My mother	261	“ I know , that ’s why this is perfect . It ’s just for the night . ”
42835	42878	42831	42832	My mother	261	“ You ’ll love it . The package includes champagne and chocolates , breakfast in bed . . . I know you said you did n’t need time away , but you ’re newlyweds ! You need at least one special night . ”
42879	42884	42885	42885	I	0	“ Gee , thanks . ”
42900	42917	42894	42894	Enzo	42	“ We ’ll , um , enjoy this . But you really did n’t have to . ”
42918	42931	42932	42933	my father	204	“ Well , you guys insisted on paying for your own wedding , ”
42936	42945	42932	42933	my father	204	“ It was the least we could do . ”
42946	42949	42950	42950	I	0	“ Right . ”
42962	42980	42950	42950	I	0	“ I ’ll be right back . I ’m just going to get another glass of Prosecco . ”
42981	42987	42989	42989	Enzo	42	“ I ’ll join you , ”
42996	43010	42989	42989	Enzo	42	“ Thank you very much for the gift , Mr. and Mrs. DeRossi . ”
43011	43015	43020	43020	his	204	“ Ah ah , ”
43035	43042	43025	43025	Enzo	42	“ I mean Mom and Dad . ”
43228	43242	43243	43243	I	0	“ So what are we going to do about this honeymoon suite thing ? ”
43249	43259	43243	43243	I	0	“ That ’s one I did n’t see coming . ”
43260	43264	43265	43265	He	774	“ Me neither . ”
43268	43278	43265	43265	He	774	“ You could go stay there , I guess . ”
43279	43283	43284	43284	I	0	“ By myself ? ”
43291	43321	43284	43284	I	0	“ Do you know how fast it would get around town that I was staying in the honeymoon suite at the Bellamy Creek Inn alone on our wedding night ? ”
43322	43325	43326	43326	Enzo	42	“ True . ”
43423	43439	43415	43415	I	0	“ But I feel bad . I do n’t want it to go to waste . ”
43451	43460	43443	43443	his	774	“ Fuck it . Let ’s use it . ”
43461	43465	43466	43466	I	0	“ Use it ? ”
43473	43480	43466	43466	I	0	“ Like stay there together tonight ? ”
43481	43484	43485	43485	He	774	“ Yeah . ”
43488	43493	43485	43485	He	774	“ Might as well . ”
43494	43501	43466	43466	I	0	“ What about the bed situation ? ”
43502	43507	43466	43466	I	0	“ What about it ? ”
43508	43517	43518	43518	I	0	“ I think we need some additional rules , ”
43539	43542	43535	43535	Enzo	42	“ Okay . ”
43543	43557	43466	43466	I	0	“ If there ’s a couch , one of us sleeps on it . ”
43558	43573	43574	43574	I	0	“ Why ? You do n’t trust yourself to share a bed with me ? ”
43579	43583	43574	43574	I	0	“ Very funny . ”
43584	43626	43466	43466	I	0	“ Bianca , if you want me to sleep on the couch , I will . But I assure you , even if we shared the bed , your virtue would be safe . I can keep my hands to myself . ”
43627	43634	43574	43574	I	0	“ Well , I can too . ”
43635	43647	43648	43648	He	774	“ So then we ’ll share a bed for a night . ”
43658	43667	43648	43648	He	774	“ Fine . We ’ll share the bed . ”
43675	43692	43668	43668	I	0	“ But no funny business . You stay on your side and I stay on mine . ”
43693	43705	43648	43648	He	774	“ Are you going to draw a line down the middle ? ”
43706	43710	43711	43711	I	0	“ I might . ”
43716	43722	43711	43711	I	0	“ And no sleeping naked . ”
43723	43731	43648	43648	He	774	“ Now you ’re just being mean . ”
43732	43738	43648	43648	He	774	“ How is that mean ? ”
43739	43784	43711	43711	I	0	“ What if I always sleep naked ? You ’re making me feel ashamed . And the human body is nothing to be ashamed of , Bianca . In fact , mine is quite nice . I think you ’d enjoy seeing it naked . ”
43785	43792	43648	43648	He	774	“ I ’m sure you do . ”
43793	43802	43803	43803	He	774	“ I might even enjoy seeing yours naked . ”
43806	43813	43803	43803	He	774	“ Just putting that out there . ”
43814	43821	43822	43822	He	774	“ Ha ! Not a chance . ”
43827	43837	43824	43824	his	774	“ I had no idea how repressed you were . ”
43838	43867	43803	43803	He	774	“ I ’m not repressed just because I wear pajamas to bed , Enzo . You ’re just trying to trick me into letting you see me naked . ”
43868	43873	43803	43803	He	774	“ Is it working ? ”
43874	43877	43878	43878	He	774	“ No . ”
43883	43908	43878	43878	He	774	“ The least you could do is walk around topless or something , considering that I just began a yearlong dry spell for you . ”
43909	43916	43917	43917	I	0	“ I think you ’ll live , ”
43925	43937	43917	43917	I	0	“ Easy for you to say . You ’re a woman . ”
43938	43942	43943	43943	I	0	“ This again ? ”
43948	43968	43943	43943	I	0	“ Contrary to what men might think , Enzo , women crave sex just as much as they do . ”
43969	43983	43984	43984	Enzo	42	“ I had no idea you were craving sex with me , Bianca . ”
43997	44012	43984	43984	Enzo	42	“ But do n’t worry , I know how we can solve this problem . ”
44024	44039	44013	44013	I	0	“ Do n’t even think about it . And get your paws off me . ”
44066	44069	44070	44070	he	774	“ Frosting , ”
44077	44086	44070	44070	he	774	“ Do n’t worry , I got it . ”
44124	44141	44119	44119	I	0	“ You made a mess shoving that cake in my face . Is it anywhere else ? ”
44154	44161	44146	44146	he	774	“ No . You look perfect . ”
44298	44302	44303	44303	Enzo	42	“ Everything okay ? ”
44343	44346	44347	44347	I	0	“ Fine , ”
44357	44366	44347	44347	I	0	“ You seem quiet all of a sudden . ”
44367	44373	44311	44311	his	774	“ I ’m just tired . ”
44374	44378	44379	44379	He	774	“ Me too . ”
44382	44389	44379	44379	He	774	“ Getting married is fucking exhausting . ”
44390	44398	44311	44311	his	774	“ Having a baby will be worse . ”
44399	44402	44403	44403	He	774	“ True . ”
44406	44421	44403	44403	He	774	“ Speaking of which , when do we go in for the first attempt ? ”
44422	44476	44311	44311	his	774	“ I have an appointment with the fertility specialist next week . Because I do n’t ovulate normally , I ’ll have to take some preliminary steps to make sure we know exactly when it will happen , and then time the insemination right . There ’s a drug I have to take . ”
44477	44485	44311	44311	his	774	“ What do I have to do ? ”
44486	44496	44403	44403	He	774	“ Not much . Show up and get off . ”
44497	44506	44507	44507	he	774	“ I prefer provide a sample , please , ”
44511	44517	44507	44507	he	774	“ Do n’t cheapen it . ”
44526	44544	44518	44518	I	0	“ Just make sure it ’s a good one . We need the gold - medal swimmers . ”
44545	44556	44403	44403	He	774	“ How dare you imply I have any other kind ? ”
44557	44562	44563	44563	I	0	“ Speaking of which . ”
44573	44582	44563	44563	I	0	“ What are you going to think about ? ”
44583	44586	44403	44403	He	774	“ When ? ”
44587	44605	44606	44606	He	774	“ While you ’re , you know , providing the sample . What will you think about ? ”
44609	44619	44606	44606	He	774	“ Jesus , Bianca . I do n’t know . ”
44620	44624	44403	44403	He	774	“ Porny stuff ? ”
44625	44653	44403	44403	He	774	“ Probably . Am I supposed to think about the Holy Ghost or something ? Because I do n’t think that will result in my best work . ”
44654	44663	44664	44664	I	0	“ It does n’t have to be religious , ”
44667	44680	44664	44664	I	0	“ Just not anything too . . . you know , skeevy . ”
44681	44717	44403	44403	He	774	“ What if your definition of skeevy is n’t the same as mine ? We ’ve never hooked up , so I do n’t know if you ’re totally vanilla or like a little kink . ”
44718	44724	44725	44725	I	0	“ What kind of kink ? ”
44730	44741	44725	44725	I	0	“ Any kind . Bondage , blindfolds , role play . ”
44742	44751	44752	44752	I	0	“ I ’ve never done anything like that , ”
44790	44810	44785	44785	I	0	“ I ’d be happy to test your limits — all in the name of research , of course . ”
44811	44819	44820	44820	I	0	“ You know what ? Never mind , ”
44830	44845	44820	44820	I	0	“ Think about whatever you want . It ’s really none of my business . ”
44919	44929	44909	44909	He	774	“ Want me to carry you over the threshold ? ”
44942	44958	44959	44959	He	774	“ So you can threaten to drop me again ? That wo n’t be necessary . ”
45045	45088	45039	45039	Enzo	42	“ Oh , look . They left us a note . ‘ Congratulations , Mr. and Mrs. Moretti . Please let us know if there ’s anything we can do to make your stay more enjoyable . Cheers to your future . ’ ”
45097	45112	45039	45039	Enzo	42	“ Everyone ’s so happy for us . It ’s making me feel bad . ”
45113	45117	45125	45125	he	797	“ I know . ”
45157	45163	45164	45164	I	0	“ But it ’s done . ”
45167	45172	45164	45164	I	0	“ It ’s done . ”
45179	45187	45173	45173	He	797	“ So now what do we do ? ”
45188	45194	45164	45164	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
45195	45203	45164	45164	I	0	“ The bar downstairs is already closed . ”
45204	45215	45173	45173	He	797	“ I ’m too tired to go back out anyway . ”
45216	45219	45220	45220	He	797	“ Same . ”
45224	45232	45220	45220	He	797	“ Should we just go to bed ? ”
45238	45242	45220	45220	He	797	“ I guess . ”
45243	45254	45255	45255	He	797	“ I ca n’t wait to get this suit off . ”
45303	45306	45307	45307	I	0	“ Enzo ! ”
45310	45315	45307	45307	I	0	“ Not in here ! ”
45316	45320	45297	45297	he	797	“ Why not ? ”
45321	45328	45297	45297	he	797	“ Because I ’m in here . ”
45329	45338	45307	45307	I	0	“ So go in the bathroom or something . ”
45339	45346	45347	45347	He	797	“ You go in the bathroom ! ”
45363	45398	45347	45347	He	797	“ This is my room too . And I do n’t have any hang - ups about my body . If you do n’t want to see it , close your eyes or something . ”
45593	45600	45575	45575	I	0	“ Fine ! Be that way ! ”
45787	45790	45791	45791	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
45798	45809	45791	45791	I	0	“ You can come out now . I ’m decent . ”

45825	45837	45791	45791	I	0	“ I ’m not scared of your man parts , Enzo . ”
45838	45858	45794	45794	my	0	“ Oh no ? Then why ’d you hide out in the bathroom the moment I unzipped my pants ? ”
45859	45866	45867	45867	Angry	125	“ To give you some privacy ! ”
45927	45943	45944	45944	He	804	“ But if you do n’t want privacy , fine . I ’ll come out . ”
45960	45969	45944	45944	He	804	“ Want help getting out of that dress ? ”
45970	45976	45977	45977	I	0	“ No , thank you , ”
45994	46002	45977	45977	I	0	“ I ’ll just be a minute . ”
46003	46007	46008	46008	He	804	“ Suit yourself . ”
46075	46078	46079	46079	I	0	“ Hey , ”
46082	46088	46089	46089	He	804	“ I do need help . ”
46100	46104	46105	46105	I	0	“ Turn around . ”
46144	46148	46140	46140	he	804	“ Thank you . ”
46149	46153	46154	46154	He	804	“ No problem . ”
46434	46437	46438	46438	I	0	“ Hey , ”
46456	46459	46460	46460	He	804	“ Hey . ”
46477	46484	46460	46460	He	804	“ For you , Mrs. Moretti . ”
46485	46492	46493	46493	I	0	“ Thank you , Mr. Moretti . ”
46500	46509	46493	46493	I	0	“ To the successful completion of phase one . ”
46510	46513	46514	46514	We	813	“ Salut . ”
46540	46555	46527	46527	I	0	“ This probably is n’t what you pictured on your wedding night , huh ? ”
46564	46580	46556	46556	Enzo	42	“ Honestly , I do n’t think I ever pictured my wedding night at all . ”
46581	46584	46585	46585	He	804	“ Seriously ? ”
46588	46595	46585	46585	He	804	“ I take it you did ? ”
46596	46608	46556	46556	Enzo	42	“ All the time . Since I was a little girl . ”
46609	46620	46621	46621	He	804	“ Are you implying it did n’t look like this ? ”
46639	46646	46626	46626	I	0	“ No . It did not . ”
46647	46661	46662	46662	He	804	“ So what did it look like ? Wait , let me guess . ”
46672	46698	46699	46699	He	804	“ A tall , strapping , dark - haired vampire carried you to his lair and penetrated you hard and deep with his steely fangs . ”
46720	46733	46734	46734	He	804	“ No , that ’s not what I pictured , you jerk . ”
46737	46742	46734	46734	He	804	“ So tell me . ”
46743	46772	46773	46773	I	0	“ When I was little , he was Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid . As a grownup , I thought I ’d marry my ex - boyfriend , ”
46783	46796	46773	46773	I	0	“ Oh , right . What was his name again ? Taint ? ”
46797	46800	46734	46734	He	804	“ Tate . ”
46801	46822	46823	46823	I	0	“ Whatever . And what was it that Taint was going to do to make the night memorable for you ? ”
46830	46857	46823	46823	I	0	“ You know what ? I ca n’t even name anything specific . It was just going to be the most magical night of my life . ”
46858	46884	46885	46885	I	0	“ Magical ? Well , fuck . You were doomed to be disappointed , babe . There ’s no such thing as a magical dick . ”
46890	46922	46885	46885	I	0	“ It was n’t his dick that was going to feel magical . It was the night itself . It was the things he ’d say . It was the mood . ”
46923	46928	46929	46929	he	815	“ Are you implying , ”
46935	46983	46929	46929	he	815	“ that the honeymoon suite at the Bellamy Creek Inn lacks mood ? We ’ve got champagne . We ’ve got chocolates . We ’ve got swans in the bathroom and pillows that say MR . and MRS . What could possibly be more romantic than that ? ”
46991	46997	46986	46986	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
46998	47020	47021	47021	He	815	“ See , I happen to think this is perfect . I never pictured anything , so I ’m not disappointed . ”
47027	47045	47021	47021	He	815	“ Except for the no - sex rule . That ’s definitely a bit of a letdown . ”
47046	47076	46986	46986	I	0	“ Well , I imagined sex too . And even if my groom did n’t have a magical dick , he would at least know how to use it . ”
47077	47081	47082	47082	Enzo	42	“ Oh yeah ? ”
47086	47093	47082	47082	Enzo	42	“ Tell me all about it . ”
47094	47101	46986	46986	I	0	“ No , you ’ll laugh . ”
47102	47111	47112	47112	He	815	“ I swear , I will not laugh . ”
47131	47140	47127	47127	his	815	“ I want to hear your innermost fantasies . ”
47149	47176	47145	47145	I	0	“ He ’d take one look at me and be completely unable to resist . He ’d want to ravage me completely . He ’d say — ”
47177	47199	47200	47200	He	815	“ Sorry , I have to interrupt for a moment . In this fantasy , are you wearing those exact pajamas ? ”
47220	47229	47208	47208	I	0	“ You know what ? Just forget it . ”
47230	47246	47247	47247	He	815	“ No , no . I ’m sorry , go on . I ’m listening . ”
47262	47270	47258	47258	his	815	“ Tell me what he ’d say . ”
47300	47339	47296	47296	his	815	“ He ’d say I was his one and only love . He ’d say nothing would ever come between us . He ’d say he could n’t wait to spend the rest of his life with me . ”
47340	47371	47372	47372	I	0	“ Did he say , ‘ You complete me ? ’ Because I saw that in a movie once and I thought it sounded like something a chick would like . ”
47379	47390	47372	47372	I	0	“ Just when I think you ’re not a pig . ”
47391	47396	47397	47397	he	815	“ I ’m sorry , ”
47402	47414	47397	47397	he	815	“ It ’s just that women and men fantasize very differently . ”
47415	47423	47424	47424	I	0	“ Okay , so tell me yours , ”
47427	47447	47424	47424	I	0	“ What would your wife say to you on your wedding night to get you all hot and bothered ? ”
47448	47451	47452	47452	he	815	“ Easy , ”
47455	47504	47452	47452	he	815	“ It ’s all one - syllable stuff like , ‘ oh , yes , God , right there , just like that , you ’re so big , do n’t stop , fuck me , harder’—I guess that ’s two syllables . But you get the gist . ”
47552	47562	47563	47563	His	815	“ Oink . Also a one - syllable word . ”
47570	47579	47563	47563	His	815	“ You do n’t like talking in bed ? ”
47601	47605	47590	47590	I	0	“ Not much . ”
47606	47647	47563	47563	His	815	“ See , I think a woman should talk in bed . I think she should say exactly what she wants and how she wants it . Otherwise , how ’s a guy supposed to know how to please her ? ”
47648	47654	47563	47563	His	815	“ I do n’t know . ”
47655	47680	47590	47590	I	0	“ Most guys probably figure if she says nothing , it all just feels good . And I bet that ’s not the case . ”
47681	47688	47689	47689	I	0	“ That is not the case , ”
47692	47700	47689	47689	I	0	“ Can I have the last chocolate ? ”
47701	47715	47716	47716	he	816	“ It ’s all yours . That ’s why you have to talk , ”
47720	47739	47716	47716	he	816	“ Tell the guy what feels good and what does n’t . He ’s not a mind reader . ”
47740	47750	47751	47751	I	0	“ But what if I ’m shy about it ? ”
47760	47768	47751	47751	I	0	“ You ? Shy ? Come on . ”
47779	47789	47769	47769	He	816	“ Maybe as a kid , but not anymore . ”
47790	47811	47812	47812	I	0	“ But I still find it difficult to be vocal about what I want in that particular situation , okay ? ”
47817	47830	47812	47812	I	0	“ So how do you let the guy know what you like ? ”
47831	47848	47769	47769	He	816	“ I just sort of think really hard about it and hope he gets the message . ”
47849	47854	47855	47855	Enzo	42	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
47874	47916	47855	47855	Enzo	42	“ No amount of wishful thinking is going to bring you some kind of fairy - tale magic - wand dick that just knows how to make you come . Even I like a little direction . You want more champagne ? ”
47963	47970	47971	47971	He	816	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
48201	48204	48190	48190	I	0	“ Hey . ”
48205	48208	48190	48190	I	0	“ What ? ”
48209	48215	48190	48190	I	0	“ I ca n’t sleep . ”
48216	48237	48238	48238	I	0	“ Me neither . I was about to jerk off , but I thought you might be mad about it . ”
48243	48250	48238	48238	I	0	“ What if I was n’t ? ”
48251	48254	48255	48255	He	820	“ Huh ? ”
48260	48266	48255	48255	He	820	“ That was a joke . ”
48267	48283	48238	48238	I	0	“ But what if I was n’t mad about it ? Would you do it ? ”
48284	48290	48291	48291	He	820	“ Hold on a second . ”
48306	48317	48291	48291	He	820	“ What the fuck are you even saying right now ? ”
48326	48367	48323	48323	he	820	“ I do n’t know . I guess I was just trying to do what you said — talk in bed . Say what I want . You never said it did n’t count if I only wanted to watch . ”
48377	48383	48373	48373	his	820	“ That ’s not funny . ”
48384	48390	48323	48323	he	820	“ I ’m not joking . ”
48391	48403	48373	48373	his	820	“ Yes , you are , and it ’s not funny . ”
48432	48454	48405	48405	he	820	“ You ’re just fucking with me , trying to make me hard so you can call me a pig again . ”
48455	48460	48461	48461	I	0	“ I am not ! ”
48474	48482	48461	48461	I	0	“ Did you take your pants off ? ”
48483	48489	48490	48490	he	820	“ I was fucking hot , ”
48493	48514	48490	48490	he	820	“ But I left my underwear on and I was n’t anywhere near you . I stayed on my side . ”
48515	48524	48525	48525	I	0	“ I ’m not accusing you of anything ! ”
48531	48539	48525	48525	I	0	“ Did I really make you hard ? ”
48540	48543	48490	48490	he	820	“ No . ”
48554	48563	48550	48550	me	0	“ Me ? In my plaid flannel pajamas ? ”
48564	48567	48568	48568	he	820	“ No , ”
48571	48578	48568	48568	he	820	“ I do n’t believe you . ”
48592	48598	48579	48579	I	0	“ Give me that pillow . ”
48599	48605	48568	48568	he	820	“ Stay back , Bianca . ”
48606	48616	48579	48579	I	0	“ Come on , just give me that pillow . ”
48636	48640	48632	48632	He	820	“ Quit it ! ”
48641	48657	48568	48568	he	820	“ What ’s the big deal , Enzo ? All I want is the pillow . ”
48658	48667	48632	48632	He	820	“ Well , you ca n’t have it . ”
48668	48672	48632	48632	He	820	“ Why not ? ”
48673	48684	48632	48632	He	820	“ Because you do n’t want what ’s behind it . ”
48701	48706	48696	48696	I	0	“ Maybe I do . ”
48707	48712	48722	48722	his	820	“ Then prove it . ”
48713	48716	48717	48717	He	820	“ How ? ”
48727	48733	48717	48717	He	820	“ Take off your pants . ”
48799	48802	48782	48782	she	79	“ Shit ! ”
48809	48816	48782	48782	she	79	“ I thought you were bluffing . ”
48817	48824	48825	48825	She	79	“ Well , I ’m not . ”
48839	48854	48825	48825	She	79	“ I ’m into this , Enzo . For one night . Are you ? ”
48855	48861	48862	48862	She	79	“ What about the contract ? ”
48865	48879	48862	48862	She	79	“ How about we draft a . . . a verbal exceptions clause ? ”
48880	48893	48825	48825	She	79	“ Like a wedding night exception ? Where we suspend the rules ? ”
48894	48897	48825	48825	She	79	“ Exactly . ”
48898	48904	48862	48862	She	79	“ And tomorrow it expires ? ”
48905	48920	48921	48921	I	0	“ Sure . I think one night should be enough to satisfy our curiosity . ”
48926	48935	48921	48921	I	0	“ Is that what we ’re calling this ? ”
48936	48944	48945	48945	She	79	“ Is n’t that what it is ? ”
48950	48977	48945	48945	She	79	“ I ’m curious about what you ’re hiding behind that pillow . And you ’re curious about how far I ’ll go to get it . ”
49002	49008	49009	49009	She	79	“ Your shirt . Off . ”
49034	49037	49009	49009	She	79	“ Done . ”
49079	49083	49084	49084	she	79	“ Now you , ”

49185	49188	49177	49177	She	79	“ Yes . ”
49249	49268	49269	49269	She	79	“ So now that you know what was behind the pillow , what else are you curious about ? ”
49293	49313	49288	49288	I	0	“ Uh uh . Not tonight , Mrs. Moretti . Tonight you have to say exactly what you want . ”
49314	49322	49323	49323	she	79	“ And you ’ll make it happen ? ”
49326	49334	49323	49323	she	79	“ You ’ll do whatever I say ? ”
49335	49349	49350	49350	She	79	“ If it ’s humanly possible and it will make you feel good . ”
49373	49377	49378	49378	I	0	“ Say it , ”
49381	49393	49378	49378	I	0	“ Tell me what you want , or this ends now . ”
49408	49476	49394	49394	She	79	“ I want to know what you ’d feel like inside me . I want to know what it ’s like to be with someone who puts me first . I want to feel beautiful , irresistible , like I ’m worth someone ’s forever , like he ’ll die if he ca n’t have me , like he ’ll lose his mind if I do n’t — ”
49477	49480	49481	49481	I	0	“ Lucy . ”
49494	49508	49481	49481	I	0	“ Take a breath , okay ? Let ’s start at the beginning . ”
49569	49575	49576	49576	I	0	“ Now let me think , ”
49584	49595	49576	49576	I	0	“ What were my lines again ? Oh , right . ”
49611	49620	49596	49596	I	0	“ You ’re my one and only love . ”
49645	49653	49633	49633	I	0	“ Nothing will ever come between us . ”
49682	49706	49707	49707	She	79	“ And I ca n’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you — or at least the rest of tonight . ”
49718	49723	49712	49712	her	79	“ You paid attention . ”
49724	49730	49731	49731	I	0	“ Of course I did . ”
50068	50072	50073	50073	She	79	“ Oh God . ”
50078	50093	50073	50073	She	79	“ That feels so good . I love your hands on me like that . ”
50108	50116	50094	50094	I	0	“ Wait until you feel my tongue . ”
50217	50220	50221	50221	she	79	“ Yes , ”
50224	50229	50221	50221	she	79	“ Yes , what ? ”
50230	50248	50249	50249	I	0	“ Yes , I want you to do that . I thought you stopped to ask permission . ”
50259	50267	50249	50249	I	0	“ Did you ? That ’s cute . ”
50268	50271	50272	50272	Her	79	“ Enzo . ”
50284	50288	50277	50277	Her	79	“ Do it . ”
50289	50293	50294	50294	I	0	“ Do what ? ”
50311	50318	50294	50294	I	0	“ Put your mouth on me . ”
50319	50323	50277	50277	Her	79	“ Say please . ”
50324	50327	50294	50294	I	0	“ Please . ”
50566	50569	50570	50570	she	79	“ Enzo , ”
50573	50583	50570	50570	she	79	“ I want you to fuck me . Now . ”
50649	50677	50646	50646	I	0	“ You ’re awfully impatient , Mrs. Moretti . I ’m still working my way through the script . I think now is when I tell you — ”
50809	50821	50822	50822	I	0	“ I did n’t know this was part of the show , ”
50825	50830	50822	50822	I	0	“ I ’m improvising . ”
51242	51250	51251	51251	she	79	“ You did n’t let me finish , ”
51264	51273	51251	51251	she	79	“ Because that ’s not how this ends . ”
51288	51295	51274	51274	I	0	“ Should I wear a condom ? ”
51296	51302	51303	51303	I	0	“ Do you want to ? ”
51338	51341	51342	51342	I	0	“ No , ”
51345	51350	51342	51342	I	0	“ Then do n’t . ”
51359	51373	51342	51342	I	0	“ If I got pregnant , it would save us time and money . ”
51374	51384	51385	51385	I	0	“ I ’m definitely into saving time and money , ”
51396	51413	51385	51385	I	0	“ But mostly I just want to know what it feels like to be inside you . ”
51467	51476	51477	51477	I	0	“ I want to make you come again , ”
51486	51491	51477	51477	I	0	“ Talk to me . ”
51492	51497	51498	51498	she	79	“ You ’re perfect , ”
51523	51555	51516	51516	Her	79	“ Do n’t stop . I love the way you move . I love how deep you are . I do n’t have words for what it ’s doing to me . ”

51845	51868	51842	51842	Bianca	79	“ Your heart is beating really fast . If you go into cardiac arrest and die , do I get the house ? ”
51880	51886	51875	51875	I	0	“ Trying to kill me ? ”
51887	51902	51926	51926	she	79	“ Of course not . We have n’t even gotten to phase two yet . ”
51903	51906	51907	51907	I	0	“ Right . ”
51918	51925	51926	51926	she	79	“ I ’ll be right back , ”
52164	52172	52173	52173	she	79	“ What ’s with the grumpy face ? ”
52199	52204	52186	52186	I	0	“ I ’m mad . ”
52205	52209	52225	52225	she	79	“ About what ? ”
52210	52218	52219	52219	Her	79	“ That the sex was so good . ”
52233	52257	52225	52225	she	79	“ Oh my God , same . I was just in the bathroom cleaning up and thinking how pissed I am at you . ”
52258	52262	52225	52225	she	79	“ At me ! ”
52263	52276	52277	52277	I	0	“ Yes . How dare you have the magic - wand dick ! ”
52282	52307	52277	52277	I	0	“ As much as I would like to agree , there was no magic involved , Bianca . You told me what you wanted . ”
52313	52320	52310	52310	her	79	“ I said like three things . ”
52321	52326	52327	52327	I	0	“ They were enough . ”
52330	52354	52355	52355	She	79	“ I also think we just had some good chemistry . And there was a lot of . . . tension built up . ”
52358	52383	52355	52355	She	79	“ Yeah . That was the best sex I ’ve ever had . But I should n’t tell you that — you’ll get smug . ”
52384	52397	52310	52310	her	79	“ I was already smug from the magic - wand dick thing . ”
52405	52413	52398	52398	She	79	“ No more compliments for you tonight . ”
52414	52432	52355	52355	She	79	“ Hey , I earned them . Did n’t I do a good job with my lines ? ”
52433	52436	52437	52437	she	79	“ Yes , ”
52440	52449	52437	52437	she	79	“ A - plus work going off book . ”

52465	52468	52461	52461	I	0	“ What ? ”

52483	52488	52461	52461	I	0	“ Um , yeah . ”
52489	52492	52493	52493	She	79	“ Good . ”
52510	52516	52517	52517	I	0	“ Now who ’s smug ? ”
52553	52559	52548	52548	She	79	“ What are you doing ? ”
52560	52572	52548	52548	She	79	“ I do n’t know . I just like your mouth . ”
52573	52588	52616	52616	her	79	“ I bet you do . I let you put your dick in it . ”
52589	52598	52599	52599	I	0	“ Hey , I liked it before that . ”
52604	52613	52599	52599	I	0	“ I just never said anything about it . ”
52623	52627	52614	52614	She	79	“ Why not ? ”
52628	52651	52599	52599	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Things just are n’t like that with us . We trade insults , not sweet nothings . ”
52652	52655	52656	52656	She	79	“ True . ”
52686	52700	52668	52668	I	0	“ So that whole exceptions clause thing . When exactly does that expire ? ”
52701	52709	52710	52710	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Midnight ? ”
52720	52733	52710	52710	I	0	“ Guess what ? It ’s only eleven - thirty - five . ”
52741	52749	52734	52734	She	79	“ You want to do it again ? ”
52750	52754	52710	52710	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
52755	52768	52769	52769	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Because we already satisfied our curiosity . ”
52774	52785	52769	52769	I	0	“ Sorry , but my curiosity is not nearly satisfied . ”
52786	52789	52769	52769	I	0	“ No ? ”
52790	52793	52769	52769	I	0	“ No . ”
52813	52831	52800	52800	I	0	“ For instance , I ’m very curious about what you look like as a reverse cowgirl . ”
52850	52858	52837	52837	her	79	“ Saddle up , Ricky . Yeehaw . ”
52862	52875	52876	52876	Bianca	79	“ If you could have a superpower , what would it be ? ”
52927	52930	52931	52931	I	0	“ Easy , ”
52934	52942	52931	52931	I	0	“ I ’d want to read minds . ”
52943	52957	52905	52905	she	79	“ Oh my God , that ’s the last thing I ’d want . ”
52958	52997	52998	52998	She	79	“ Why ? It would make you so powerful . You ’d be able to outsmart any opponent , win every argument , know every pitch that was coming at you before you had to take a swing . ”
53003	53020	53000	53000	her	79	“ Life is not a baseball game , and some thoughts are meant to be private . ”
53021	53031	52998	52998	She	79	“ Okay , so what superpower would you want ? ”
53032	53036	53037	53037	she	79	“ Time travel , ”
53040	53054	53037	53037	she	79	“ So I could go back and undo a bunch of stupid mistakes . ”
53102	53113	53114	53114	She	79	“ Like bringing a book to that high school dance ? ”
53119	53128	53116	53116	her	79	“ No . I stand by that decision . ”
53141	53168	53131	53131	I	0	“ Come here , selfish , I have to stretch my legs and you ’re taking up all the room at that end of the tub . ”
53278	53281	53282	53282	I	0	“ So , ”
53296	53303	53282	53282	I	0	“ It ’s definitely after midnight . ”
53304	53308	53309	53309	I	0	“ It is . ”

53334	53345	53346	53346	She	79	“ Then I believe it is unanimous , Mrs. Moretti . ”
53357	53364	53349	53349	her	79	“ That is so fucking weird . ”
53365	53378	53282	53282	I	0	“ I know . Are you actually going to change your name ? ”
53379	53392	53282	53282	I	0	“ I guess . It might look suspicious if I do n’t . ”
53393	53399	53400	53400	I	0	“ I think you should . ”
53478	53495	53453	53453	her	79	“ You know , all things considered , this has been a pretty good wedding night . ”
53499	53511	53496	53496	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? Did I say all the right things ? ”
53512	53517	53453	53453	her	79	“ I think so . ”
53518	53534	53535	53535	She	79	“ You think so ? Give me something else . I ’ll work it in . ”
53547	53567	53537	53537	her	79	“ Hmm . Give me a line from Romeo and Juliet . Not the one about dying , please . ”
53568	53575	53576	53576	I	0	“ Okay . Let me think . ”
53606	53612	53613	53613	I	0	“ I ’ve got it , ”
53617	53622	53613	53613	I	0	“ I ’m listening . ”
53623	53659	53586	53586	she	79	“ O my love , I ’ve been really trying . Trying to hold back this feeling for so long . And if , perchance , you feel like I feel , then come on . ”
53660	53663	53664	53664	She	79	“ Enzo ! ”
53673	53684	53664	53664	She	79	“ That is not Shakespeare , that is Marvin Gaye ! ”
53685	53694	53695	53695	I	0	“ But I changed it up a little , ”
53699	53707	53695	53695	I	0	“ Made it sound fancy and shit . ”
53708	53714	53715	53715	She	79	“ You ’re the worst . ”
53735	53742	53717	53717	her	79	“ But you make me laugh . ”
53743	53755	53756	53756	I	0	“ I ’m about to make you do more than that , ”
53773	53780	53767	53767	She	79	“ Let ’s get it on . ”
54013	54019	54009	54009	her	79	“ made the earth quake ? ”
54150	54155	54156	54156	she	79	“ You ’re up , ”
54159	54164	54156	54156	she	79	“ I ’m up . ”
54192	54198	54199	54199	she	79	“ You ’re really up , ”
54211	54219	54199	54199	she	79	“ I always wake up this way , ”
54240	54259	54260	54260	she	79	“ Do n’t worry , I ’m not going to ask to play with your magic wand again , ”
54309	54312	54313	54313	I	0	“ Good , ”
54375	54395	54372	54372	her	79	“ You do n’t have to hide , Enzo . I ’ve already seen what ’s under the sheet . ”
54396	54411	54412	54412	I	0	“ I ’m not hiding . I ’m covering up . For your sake , ”
54420	54424	54415	54415	Her	79	“ My sake ? ”
54425	54462	54463	54463	She	79	“ Yes . I would n’t want you to get excited about something you ca n’t have . It would be like putting your favorite dessert on the menu but saying you ca n’t order it . ”
54466	54486	54463	54463	She	79	“ I think I ’ll be okay . I had enough dessert last night to last me a while . ”
54487	54492	54493	54493	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , ”
55218	55227	55213	55213	he	855	“ Did you take care of your problem ? ”
55228	55249	55213	55213	he	855	“ I did n’t have a problem , Bianca . I had a hard - on . It went away . ”
55250	55255	55256	55256	I	0	“ All by itself ? ”
55276	55279	55280	55280	he	855	“ Yes , ”
55358	55392	55349	55349	I	0	“ Are you hungry ? I thought we could go down to breakfast in the dining room here before we check out . I ’m assuming we do n’t want breakfast in bed . ”
55393	55402	55403	55403	He	855	“ I ’m good with the dining room . ”
55415	55432	55403	55403	He	855	“ Unless you want to hang out in here and stare at my butt all day . ”
55455	55464	55465	55465	He	855	“ I was n’t staring at your butt ! ”
55468	55471	55465	55465	He	855	“ No ? ”
55472	55475	55478	55478	I	0	“ No . ”
55482	55549	55478	55478	I	0	“ I just . . . noticed it , that ’s all . It was right at my eye level . But from now on , if you would n’t mind not walking around naked , I would appreciate it . Despite what happened last night , this is still a business arrangement . I do n’t want us to blur the lines and get confused . ”
55550	55573	55574	55574	He	855	“ Ten minutes ago you said I did n’t have to hide behind a sheet because you ’d already seen me naked . ”
55621	55637	55612	55612	I	0	“ I just want us to be clear that the rules are back in place . ”
55638	55662	55663	55663	He	855	“ Do n’t worry . We ’ll have our own bedrooms at my house , so my naked ass will not confuse you . ”
55682	55691	55692	55692	I	0	“ Are we still moving me in today ? ”
55716	55721	55692	55692	I	0	“ Works for me . ”
55722	55747	55750	55750	him	855	“ Good . I ’m all packed up . Might take us a few trips , but everything is in boxes ready to go . ”
55776	55791	55768	55768	I	0	“ I ’ll just blow dry my hair and then we can go eat . ”
55818	55837	55838	55838	Enzo	42	“ So what are the chances that we actually , you know , did the thing last night ? ”
55851	55857	55838	55838	Enzo	42	“ That we actually what ? ”
55867	55877	55878	55878	I	0	“ Saved time and money . Completed phase two . ”
55886	55900	55878	55878	I	0	“ Oh — you mean , what are the chances I got pregnant ? ”
55901	55904	55905	55905	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
55914	55956	55905	55905	I	0	“ I have no clue . Like I said yesterday , I do n’t ovulate normally . So I ’m never sure what my fertile days are . But if I had to guess , I ’d say slim to none . ”
55957	55989	55878	55878	I	0	“ I do n’t really get that whole ‘ fertile days ’ stuff . So you ca n’t just get pregnant any time ? You have to wait for certain days ? ”
55990	56016	56017	56017	His	867	“ I mean , I think it ’s technically possible to get pregnant at any time , but it ’s unlikely . Especially for me . ”
56029	56051	56023	56023	he	867	“ But we did it like four times last night . I feel like I hit the target at least once . ”
56060	56085	56052	56052	I	0	“ This is n’t like throwing darts , Enzo . It ’s not dependent on your skill level , impressive as it may be . ”
56086	56097	56023	56023	he	867	“ You were impressed with my skill level , huh ? ”
56098	56101	56102	56102	I	0	“ Maybe , ”
56106	56132	56102	56102	I	0	“ Certainly your stamina . Your enthusiasm . And the , um , size of your equipment . I definitely stand corrected on that count . ”
56143	56154	56133	56133	His	867	“ Thank you . I work well under a deadline . ”
56164	56173	56155	56155	I	0	“ So you ’re saying it was work ? ”
56174	56187	56263	56263	His	867	“ Okay , I perform well under pressure . Is that better ? ”
56188	56191	56155	56155	I	0	“ Marginally . ”
56192	56248	56155	56155	I	0	“ Look , I was racing against the clock , that ’s all I meant . I kept thinking you were going to say time ’s up , clause is null and void , contract is back in place . I had to try to get my fill of you before you closed up shop . ”
56249	56254	56263	56263	His	867	“ And did you ? ”
56255	56262	56263	56263	His	867	“ Get my fill of you ? ”
56272	56277	56263	56263	His	867	“ Honestly , no . ”
56296	56302	56282	56282	I	0	“ What are you saying ? ”
56303	56316	56317	56317	Our	868	“ I ’m not saying anything . I was answering your question . ”
56330	56337	56338	56338	she	869	“ And how are my newlyweds ? ”
56346	56349	56350	56350	Enzo	42	“ Good , ”
56359	56369	56370	56370	Shelly	48	“ So are you heading off on a honeymoon ? ”
56376	56382	56370	56370	Shelly	48	“ Somewhere warm and sunny ? ”
56383	56392	56393	56393	Enzo	42	“ No , Shelly , we are not . ”
56408	56439	56393	56393	Enzo	42	“ Believe it or not , I offered to take my beautiful bride anywhere she wanted to go , anywhere in the world , and you know what she said ? ”
56440	56443	56444	56444	Shelly	48	“ What ? ”
56456	56480	56448	56448	Enzo	42	“ She said she did n’t need fancy trips to exotic locales . Just being married to me was a vacation in itself . ”
56481	56484	56485	56485	Shelly	48	“ Oh . ”
56507	56515	56487	56487	her	870	“ Is that really what you said ? ”
56516	56521	56522	56522	I	0	“ It ’s close , ”
56542	56548	56539	56539	Shelly	48	“ That ’s so romantic . ”
56549	56554	56555	56555	Enzo	42	“ Is n’t it ? ”
56563	56579	56555	56555	Enzo	42	“ What do you say , dumpling , should we finish up and get going ? ”
56585	56588	56580	56580	I	0	“ Sure . ”
56589	56601	56602	56602	Shelly	48	“ Would you like to put this on your room charge ? ”
56605	56610	56602	56602	Shelly	48	“ Yes , please . ”
56618	56621	56611	56611	Enzo	42	“ Thanks . ”
56635	56642	56643	56643	He	871	“ What was that all about ? ”
56646	56661	56643	56643	He	871	“ Just keeping up the act . I thought hand - kissing was allowed . ”
56662	56687	56633	56633	Enzo	42	“ No , not that . The thing you said . About . . . about not getting your fill of me last night . ”
56688	56693	56694	56694	Enzo	42	“ Oh , that . ”
56704	56714	56697	56697	his	871	“ Yes , that . What did you mean ? ”
56720	56769	56770	56770	He	871	“ Exactly what I said . I did n’t get enough . If you were anyone else , and this was any other situation , we would n’t be down here eating breakfast right now . We ’d still be upstairs bouncing fake rose petals off the bed . ”
56776	56795	56770	56770	He	871	“ But rules are rules , and I understand why we have to put them back in place . ”
56796	56800	56837	56837	his	871	“ You do ? ”
56801	56834	56835	56835	He	871	“ Sure . It ’s like you said before , when my naked ass confused you , this is still a business arrangement . We do n’t want to blur the lines . ”
56843	56846	56837	56837	his	871	“ Right ? ”
56847	56850	56851	56851	I	0	“ Right . ”
56862	56869	56851	56851	I	0	“ That ’s what I said . ”
57340	57349	57350	57350	She	115	“ So ? How was the wedding night ? ”
57384	57389	57374	57374	I	0	“ It was good . ”
57390	57398	57399	57399	I	0	“ Elaborate please . Were there shenanigans ? ”
57416	57426	57399	57399	I	0	“ There may have been a shenanigan or two . ”
57433	57438	57430	57430	Blair	115	“ I knew it ! ”
57456	57462	57444	57444	her	115	“ What do you mean ? ”
57468	57500	57463	57463	She	115	“ After seeing you guys together at the reception , I bet Griffin fifty bucks you guys would n’t be able to stay in the same hotel room without messing around . ”
57501	57504	57505	57505	I	0	“ Seriously ? ”
57508	57526	57505	57505	I	0	“ Yes , except it was so obviously true that Griff would n’t even take the bet . ”
57527	57533	57463	57463	She	115	“ How was it obvious ? ”
57534	57552	57505	57505	I	0	“ It just was . There ’s something between you guys that just , like , sizzles . ”
57564	57593	57559	57559	I	0	“ I ’m not even sure how it happened . One minute we were arguing , as usual , and the next I was taking off my pants . ”
57597	57607	57594	57594	She	115	“ Sounds about right . So was it good ? ”
57608	57613	57614	57614	I	0	“ It was amazing , ”
57617	57652	57614	57614	I	0	“ The man knows what he ’s doing . And he ’s not selfish at all , like I thought he would be . He ’s patient and generous and highly , highly skilled . ”
57653	57665	57594	57594	She	115	“ Wow . So was it kind of like hate sex ? ”
57671	57704	57594	57594	She	115	“ No . We laughed a lot . It was really fun . Then after the first time , we both said how mad we were that it had been so good . ”
57705	57713	57614	57614	I	0	“ Why would that make you mad ? ”
57714	57729	57614	57614	I	0	“ Because we were n’t allowed to do it again . But we did . ”
57737	57742	57734	57734	my	0	“ Three more times . ”
57747	57763	57734	57734	my	0	“ Even Griffin and I only managed to do it once on our wedding night . ”
57764	57807	57614	57614	I	0	“ That ’s different . You guys had done it before , and you knew you ’d have all your lives to do it again — as many times as you want to . Enzo and I just had the one night . ”
57812	57831	57808	57808	She	115	“ I do n’t understand . You ’re married . Why would you only have the one night ? ”
57832	57842	57843	57843	I	0	“ Because sex is n’t part of our arrangement . ”
57854	57884	57885	57885	She	115	“ We agreed on that . We just sort of gave ourselves a wedding - night free - for - all . Now it ’s back to the rules . ”
57891	57909	57885	57885	She	115	“ So are you saying you ’d turn him away if he knocked on your door tonight ? ”
57910	57921	57808	57808	She	115	“ He ’s not going to knock on my door . ”
57934	57940	57941	57941	she	115	“ But if he did , ”
57944	57950	57941	57941	she	115	“ What would you do ? ”
57951	57959	57808	57808	She	115	“ Hmmm . Is he wearing clothes ? ”
57960	57968	57885	57885	She	115	“ Let ’s say he ’s shirtless . ”
57969	57982	57941	57941	she	115	“ Damn . Is his hair doing that thing in the front ? ”
57983	57996	57808	57808	She	115	“ Definitely . And he smells good . Like , really good . ”
57997	58005	58006	58006	I	0	“ Ugh , that ’s so annoying . ”
58009	58033	58006	58006	I	0	“ Ideally , I like to think I ’d be strong enough to be the first female in his life to resist him . ”
58041	58061	58037	58037	I	0	“ Realistically , though , I ’d probably think about it for two seconds , then jump his bones . ”
58067	58072	58062	58062	She	115	“ I knew it . ”
58314	58318	58319	58319	I	0	“ Want some ? ”
58337	58341	58333	58333	He	909	“ No thanks . ”
58353	58358	58343	58343	he	909	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
58369	58383	58343	58343	he	909	“ My mother wants us to come for Sunday dinner tomorrow after church . ”
58384	58387	58388	58388	I	0	“ Okay . ”
58391	58397	58398	58398	He	909	“ Is that a problem ? ”
58403	58424	58398	58398	He	909	“ Father Mike is coming . I think she ’s going to push us again about having the marriage blessed . ”
58425	58428	58429	58429	I	0	“ Oh . ”
58438	58454	58429	58429	I	0	“ I still feel weird about that . Since this is n’t a real marriage . ”
58455	58458	58459	58459	He	909	“ Same . ”
58488	58508	58479	58479	his	909	“ I ’ll think of some way to put her off . Want to watch a movie or something ? ”
58509	58512	58513	58513	I	0	“ Sure . ”
58611	58615	58616	58616	I	0	“ Everything okay ? ”
58627	58633	58616	58616	I	0	“ Yeah . Just thinking . ”
58634	58639	58603	58603	he	909	“ About the priest ? ”
58640	58647	58616	58616	I	0	“ About my parents , actually . ”
58648	58653	58654	58654	He	909	“ What about them ? ”
58672	58689	58690	58690	I	0	“ Their relationship is a big reason why I ’ve never really looked forward to marriage . ”
58697	58701	58690	58690	I	0	“ Tell me . ”
58702	58795	58616	58616	I	0	“ Basically , here ’s what I grew up thinking about being married to someone — it ’s noisy , frustrating , and sometimes destructive . There ’s a lot of yelling , and the things you yell loudest are the things you know will piss the other person off the most . You never let something go that might be used to pick a fight . And if you ’re not getting your point across with volume , just slam a door , throw some dishes , or threaten to leave . ”
58796	58799	58800	58800	My	0	“ Wow . ”
58805	58816	58800	58800	My	0	“ I had no idea your parents fought so much . ”
58817	58901	58616	58616	I	0	“ They do n’t do it in public . And maybe it ’s not as bad as it used to be , but growing up , it was bad enough that I could not imagine why anyone would choose to get married if they did n’t have to . It ’s like you ’re handing another person instructions on exactly how to make your life a living hell , a map detailing where all of your buttons are and how to push them . ”
58902	58918	58800	58800	My	0	“ Well , they must have had some good times . They ’re still together . ”
58919	58933	58800	58800	My	0	“ Yeah . They ’re good at two things . Fighting and sex . ”
58945	58954	58955	58955	He	921	“ Sounds like another married couple I know . ”
58963	58972	58959	58959	his	921	“ Please . We are not my parents . ”
58973	58989	58990	58990	I	0	“ No , we ’re not . And we ’re not my parents , either . ”
59002	59044	58990	58990	I	0	“ My mother is completely subservient to my dad . She ’s never stood up to him a day in her life , even when I know she disagrees . It always drove me nuts . And I think . . . ”
59051	59114	59045	59045	I	0	“ I think that ’s why I get so mad about my last relationship . I ended up going along with what he wanted for way too long , just to hang on to him . Not that my father ever betrayed my mother — that I know of — but I never wanted to be that way . Timid and deferential . ”
59123	59137	59115	59115	He	922	“ Princess , you did not inherit a single subservient or deferential gene . ”
59157	59165	59152	59152	he	922	“ Why are your feet so cold ? ”
59166	59169	59170	59170	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
59176	59196	59170	59170	I	0	“ My socks got wet earlier , and I meant to go put on a new pair and forgot . ”
59251	59288	59247	59247	he	922	“ I guess my point was that I ’m glad we ’re doing things our way . I was always afraid of turning into them . It did n’t seem like a nice way to live . ”
59289	59292	59293	59293	I	0	“ Same , ”
59305	59321	59293	59293	I	0	“ Our marriage might be a sham , but at least it ’s not dysfunctional . ”
59322	59325	59326	59326	His	922	“ Right . ”
59371	59377	59360	59360	he	922	“ What should we watch ? ”
59495	59498	59499	59499	he	922	“ Night , ”
59503	59506	59507	59507	I	0	“ Night , ”
59859	59862	59863	59863	she	929	“ Yes ? ”
59866	59872	59863	59863	she	929	“ Can I come in ? ”
59873	59876	59863	59863	she	929	“ Okay . ”
59902	59907	59908	59908	she	929	“ What is it ? ”
59916	59922	59908	59908	she	929	“ I was just thinking . ”
59923	59927	59908	59908	she	929	“ About what ? ”
59928	59935	59936	59936	She	929	“ About saving time and money . ”
59941	59944	59936	59936	She	929	“ Huh ? ”
59957	59996	59945	59945	I	0	“ Saving time and money on the inseminations , like you said . Instead of paying for just one shot each month , we could just keep trying at home for free , as often as we want . ”
60009	60019	59997	59997	I	0	“ Since we ’ve already done it and all . ”
60020	60025	60026	60026	Her	929	“ But . . . ”
60033	60039	60026	60026	Her	929	“ What about the rules ? ”
60040	60075	60077	60077	I	0	“ I ’ve got it all figured out . What if we mutually agreed to suspend that particular rule in the interest of , uh , increasing our chances of success in phase two ? ”
60092	60119	60120	60120	She	929	“ I feel that phase two deserves a strong , proactive commitment and an innovative approach in order to . . . maximize opportunities for conception . ”
60123	60140	60120	60120	She	929	“ That ’s why you ’re in here right now ? To maximize opportunities for conception ? ”
60141	60152	60165	60165	her	929	“ Of course . What other reason would there be ? ”
60153	60159	60160	60160	She	929	“ I do n’t know . ”
60168	60173	60160	60160	She	929	“ You tell me . ”
60202	60213	60214	60214	I	0	“ Okay , maybe I can think of another reason , ”
60245	60256	60237	60237	she	929	“ First you have to tell me what it is . ”
60263	60298	60257	60257	I	0	“ Look , I ’m offering you my superior genetic material — which is why you married me , after all — for free , whenever you want it . What ’s the problem ? ”
60304	60315	60301	60301	her	929	“ That ’s not how this is going to work . ”
60320	60333	60316	60316	I	0	“ Fine . I had a good time with you last night . ”
60334	60337	60301	60301	her	929	“ And ? ”
60338	60347	60301	60301	her	929	“ And I want to do it again . ”
60348	60351	60316	60316	I	0	“ Because ? ”
60352	60358	60301	60301	her	929	“ Because it felt good . ”
60359	60360	60301	60301	her	929	“ Buuut”—she
60361	60382	60316	60316	I	0	shrugged—“you could make yourself feel good all by yourself in your room . You do n’t need me for that . ”
60383	60386	60387	60387	I	0	“ Fine . ”
60392	60400	60387	60387	I	0	“ I enjoy making you feel good . ”
60406	60414	60387	60387	I	0	“ Why ? Do you like me ? ”
60415	60420	60421	60421	I	0	“ Goddammit , Bianca , ”
60424	60495	60421	60421	I	0	“ You ’re such a pain in the ass ! I want you , okay ? Is that what you want to hear ? I knocked on your door tonight because I was lying in bed alone and I could n’t stop thinking about you . Now you can tell me to fuck off if you want to , but quit playing games ! Do you want me or not ? ”
60511	60518	60519	60519	she	937	“ Yes , I want you , ”
60522	60529	60519	60519	she	937	“ But I like playing games . ”
60545	60552	60553	60553	I	0	“ You drive me fucking crazy , ”
60571	60588	60553	60553	I	0	“ Like honest to God , you make me feel like I ’m losing my mind . ”
60601	60613	60591	60591	she	937	“ God , she was right . You do smell good . ”
60614	60617	60640	60640	her	937	“ Huh ? ”
60618	60635	60636	60636	she	937	“ Never mind . I have decided I like your proposed amendments to our earlier agreement , ”
60645	60669	60636	60636	she	937	“ Also your sizable assets and your willingness to be flexible . Shall we just call the orgasms a value - added experience ? ”
60676	60684	60670	60670	I	0	“ Now that ’s more like it . ”
60840	60848	60849	60849	she	937	“ Think we ’re expected at church ? ”
60856	60868	60849	60849	she	937	“ Probably . And then at my parents ’ for dinner . ”
60872	60876	60869	60869	She	937	“ Oh yeah . ”
60889	60910	60877	60877	I	0	“ I suppose we could skip out . I do n’t think anyone would begrudge us a little honeymoon weekend . ”
60911	60920	60852	60852	her	937	“ But the priest is coming for dinner . ”
60921	60946	60977	60977	Her	937	“ All the more reason to absent ourselves . My mother will probably try to make him bless us right over the chicken parm . ”
60947	60956	60877	60877	I	0	“ Good point . Let ’s play hooky . ”
60957	60972	60852	60852	her	937	“ What should we do instead ? What does your perfect Sunday look like ? ”
60973	60976	60877	60877	I	0	“ Hmm . ”
60984	60992	60977	60977	Her	937	“ This is a pretty good start . ”
60993	60997	60852	60852	her	937	“ I agree . ”
60998	61029	61030	61030	She	937	“ And then there would be food . Waffles or something . Then I ’d probably curl up on the couch with a book and a blanket and some coffee . ”
61036	61041	61030	61030	She	937	“ Am I boring ? ”
61042	61045	60852	60852	her	937	“ Yes . ”
61049	61059	61046	61046	She	937	“ What would you do with a rainy Sunday ? ”
61060	61078	61030	61030	She	937	“ Honestly , I ’d probably get under the blanket and try to take your pants off . ”
61079	61091	61046	61046	She	937	“ Are n’t you tired of getting my pants off yet ? ”
61092	61099	61046	61046	She	937	“ Is that a real question ? ”
61100	61103	61030	61030	She	937	“ Yes . ”
61123	61132	61133	61133	She	937	“ Does it feel that way to you ? ”
61138	61162	61133	61133	She	937	“ You said yesterday at the inn you were always hard in the morning . You said specifically it was n’t about me . ”
61163	61175	61176	61176	I	0	“ That was a lie . It was definitely about you . ”
61194	61204	61176	61176	I	0	“ Did you tell any lies at the inn ? ”
61205	61208	61209	61209	She	937	“ Hmm . ”
61215	61236	61209	61209	She	937	“ Yes . I lied when I said I was n’t staring at your butt . I was definitely staring . ”
61237	61243	61176	61176	I	0	“ I definitely saw that . ”
61244	61251	61252	61252	She	937	“ I could n’t help it . ”
61260	61268	61252	61252	She	937	“ You ’ve got a great ass . ”
61269	61275	61276	61276	I	0	“ The feeling is mutual , ”
61279	61304	61276	61276	I	0	“ In fact , I once had this dream where I was chasing you through the house and you were only wearing an apron . ”
61308	61314	61305	61305	She	937	“ Did you catch me ? ”
61315	61319	61252	61252	She	937	“ Uh huh . ”
61320	61325	61305	61305	She	937	“ What happened next ? ”
61326	61341	61342	61342	She	937	“ I do n’t know . I woke up and had to jerk off . ”
61345	61356	61342	61342	She	937	“ Next time we ’ll give it a better ending . ”
61441	61446	61447	61447	I	0	“ What the hell ? ”
61455	61468	61469	61469	She	937	“ I ca n’t find anything . Where is the rubber spatula ? ”
61474	61491	61469	61469	She	937	“ Try the drawer to your left there . I had to rearrange some things yesterday . ”
61498	61503	61492	61492	I	0	“ You had to ? ”
61504	61515	61535	61535	she	937	“ I wanted to . Your system made no sense . ”
61516	61523	61524	61524	I	0	“ It made sense to me , ”
61558	61573	61546	61546	her	937	“ Sorry . Want me to draw you a map of where everything is ? ”
61574	61584	61587	61587	her	937	“ Never mind . I ’ll figure it out . ”
61598	61618	61587	61587	her	937	“ You know , I do n’t think I ’ve ever made breakfast for someone in my kitchen before . ”
61619	61622	61623	61623	She	937	“ No ? ”
61637	61655	61623	61623	She	937	“ Not like this . I ’ve never been big on sleepovers , especially at my house . ”
61656	61661	61662	61662	I	0	“ I ’m shocked . ”
61668	61686	61687	61687	She	937	“ Be nice , or I wo n’t say the cute thing I was about to say . ”
61690	61697	61687	61687	She	937	“ What ’s the cute thing ? ”
61698	61708	61709	61709	I	0	“ That I am genuinely enjoying having you here . ”
61715	61725	61709	61709	I	0	“ Brace yourself — I think I like you . ”
61726	61729	61730	61730	She	937	“ Ewwww . ”
61739	61745	61735	61735	she	937	“ I know , right ? ”
61746	61756	61757	61757	She	937	“ I suppose it could be an okay thing . ”
61766	61774	61757	61757	She	937	“ Since we ’re married and all . ”
61815	61840	61841	61841	Bianca	79	“ Hey , do you think we should adjust our written contract to reflect the eighty - sixing of the no - sex rule ? ”
61844	61863	61864	61864	She	937	“ Um , I ’m not likely to forget sex is now on the menu . Are you ? ”
61867	61886	61864	61864	She	937	“ No . And you were right — the more times we try , the better our chances . ”
61887	61901	61902	61902	I	0	“ I ’m always right , babe , so get used to it . ”
61910	61928	61902	61902	I	0	“ And just to let you know , I was really focused on the task this morning . ”
61929	61948	61949	61949	Her	937	“ I thank you for your professional dedication , but do you have to call it a task ? ”
61953	61981	61949	61949	Her	937	“ Sorry . I ’ll call it target shooting — that ’s more like a hobby , right ? Or a sport ? An enjoyable leisure activity ? ”
61996	62037	61984	61984	her	937	“ You know , if anybody had told me a year ago I ’d be married to Bianca DeRossi and trying to have a baby , I ’d have asked him what he was smoking . But here we are . ”
62038	62043	61984	61984	her	937	“ Here we are . ”
62044	62051	62052	62052	I	0	“ And you know what else ? ”
62064	62080	62052	62052	I	0	“ Since we ’re friends now , I ’m going to tell you a secret . ”
62081	62084	62085	62085	Her	937	“ Oooh ! ”
62090	62098	62085	62085	Her	937	“ Yes , tell me a secret . ”
62099	62124	62125	62125	I	0	“ I thought I ’d hate being married , but I kind of like it . It makes me want to do . . . ”
62133	62139	62125	62125	I	0	“ Drastic and manly things . ”
62145	62154	62140	62140	She	937	“ Drastic and manly things ? Like what ? ”
62155	62173	62174	62174	I	0	“ Well , now that you laughed at me , I ’m not going to tell you , ”
62185	62201	62202	62202	I	0	“ No , come on . Tell me . I really want to hear this . ”
62210	62273	62274	62274	I	0	“ Okay . So ever since we said I do , sometimes when I look at you , I get this caveman instinct to throw you over my shoulder and growl at any asshole who tries to get close . I know it sounds possessive and sexist and horrible , because you are not my property , but you are my wife . ”
62277	62303	62274	62274	I	0	“ And you can call me a pig , but I ca n’t help it if being a husband brings out that side of me . ”
62308	62331	62304	62304	She	944	“ If I told you I kind of like it , are you going to beat your chest and make ape noises ? ”
62332	62336	62337	62337	I	0	“ I might . ”
62358	62377	62347	62347	She	944	“ So , hitting the target . . . This is one of your drastic and manly things ? ”
62378	62381	62382	62382	I	0	“ Yes . ”
62396	62413	62382	62382	I	0	“ Which means my ego is involved now , and when that happens — look out . ”
62414	62431	62433	62433	she	944	“ Then this is one time when I actually hope to make your ego even bigger . ”
62439	62444	62433	62433	she	944	“ God help me . ”
62496	62503	62504	62504	Beckett	78	“ That ’s a new one , ”
62515	62525	62504	62504	Beckett	78	“ I did n’t even know Griff could cook . ”
62526	62537	62538	62538	I	0	“ I think Blair might have taught him some things . ”
62543	62557	62538	62538	I	0	“ But I agree , he ’s definitely more domesticated than ever before . ”
62558	62563	62564	62564	he	78	“ What about you ? ”
62581	62587	62564	62564	he	78	“ How ’s married life ? ”
62588	62595	62538	62538	I	0	“ It ’s good , actually . ”
62596	62599	62600	62600	Beckett	78	“ Yeah ? ”
62607	62610	62600	62600	Beckett	78	“ Yeah . ”
62618	62635	62636	62636	He	78	“ Turns out , I do n’t hate it as much as I thought I would . ”
62639	62649	62636	62636	He	78	“ Maybe because it ’s only been four days ? ”
62650	62653	62654	62654	I	0	“ Maybe . ”
62659	62674	62654	62654	I	0	“ But it ’s probably because she gave up the no - sex rule . ”
62675	62703	62636	62636	He	78	“ Wait a minute . There was a no - sex rule ? How the hell were you guys going to have a baby without having sex ? ”
62704	62709	62710	62710	I	0	“ Do n’t ask . ”
62715	62763	62710	62710	I	0	“ She wanted to make it all complicated and do an insemination at a fertility clinic , but I convinced her it would be much more convenient , less expensive , and more likely to work if we just went about it the old - fashioned way . ”
62771	62774	62768	62768	his	78	“ Genius . ”
62775	62778	62768	62768	his	78	“ Right ? ”
62779	62793	62768	62768	his	78	“ And you ’re going to split up after the baby is born ? ”
62794	62797	62768	62768	his	78	“ Yes . ”
62798	62809	62768	62768	his	78	“ That might be tough . Do n’t you think ? ”
62810	62821	62822	62822	I	0	“ I think we ’ll be able to stay friends , ”
62852	62860	62841	62841	I	0	“ We ’re really getting along now . ”
62861	62868	62876	62876	Beckett	78	“ I meant on the kid . ”
62869	62872	62873	62873	I	0	“ Oh . ”
62971	62982	62983	62983	I	0	“ I ’m going to raise the baby with her , ”
62987	62998	62983	62983	I	0	“ He or she will definitely have two involved parents . ”
62999	63004	63005	63005	He	78	“ That ’s good . ”
63013	63019	63020	63020	I	0	“ How ’s your dad ? ”
63050	63055	63056	63056	he	78	“ Do n’t ask , ”
63059	63071	63056	63056	he	78	“ I ’m sorry , man . Is it that bad ? ”
63072	63078	63079	63079	Beckett	78	“ It ’s pretty bad . ”
63083	63139	63079	63079	Beckett	78	“ And over the winter I was around more to keep an eye on him , but pretty soon the days will get longer , and I ’ll be out of the house from sunup until sundown . He ’ll need constant supervision , whether he likes it or not — and he will not . ”
63140	63147	63079	63079	Beckett	78	“ I thought you hired someone . ”
63148	63155	63156	63156	Beckett	78	“ I ’ve hired three people , ”
63172	63230	63156	63156	Beckett	78	“ He fires them all as soon as I leave the house . And even when I tell the caregivers he does n’t have the authority to do that , he ’s such an asshole , they want to quit . He just has no filter anymore . He told one she had a face for radio . ”
63234	63244	63231	63231	I	0	“ Sorry , I know it ’s not funny . ”
63245	63270	63079	63079	Beckett	78	“ He also thinks he ’s a Major League ball player now . He ’s always talking about having to get to his games . ”
63271	63279	63156	63156	Beckett	78	“ Well , that seems harmless enough . ”
63280	63319	63231	63231	I	0	“ Not to me , it does n’t . I ’m trying to keep him grounded in reality . And all he does is fight me , lie to me , or accuse me of stealing his things . ”
63320	63324	63079	63079	Beckett	78	“ What things ? ”
63325	63342	63156	63156	Beckett	78	“ Oh , you name it . His baseball uniform , his money , his car . ”
63343	63351	63231	63231	I	0	“ Can I do anything to help ? ”
63352	63372	63373	63373	He	958	“ Nah . I ’ll figure it out . I just have a lot to deal with right now . ”
63379	63385	63373	63373	He	958	“ You remember Maddie Blake ? ”
63391	63398	63386	63386	I	0	“ The one that got away ? ”
63402	63411	63399	63399	He	958	“ Fuck off , we were just friends . ”
63412	63420	63231	63231	I	0	“ She was always at your house . ”
63421	63443	63373	63373	He	958	“ Because she lived across the road and we had classes together . We did homework at my house , asshole . ”
63444	63455	63399	63399	He	958	“ Fine , but you still wanted to bang her . ”
63456	63467	63231	63231	I	0	“ Yeah , well , she had a jerk boyfriend . ”
63479	63491	63399	63399	He	958	“ Did n’t you kick his ass at the prom afterparty ? ”
63500	63503	63399	63399	He	958	“ Yeah . ”
63504	63533	63399	63399	He	958	“ Dude , that ’s the maddest I ’ve ever seen you get . I thought for sure you were gon na knock that guy ’s teeth out . ”
63534	63539	63540	63540	He	78	“ I should have . ”
63545	63576	63540	63540	He	78	“ He was such a dick to her . But he was so drunk , it was n’t even fair . She begged me not to bust up his face . ”
63577	63587	63588	63588	Beckett	78	“ I ca n’t even remember what started it . ”
63591	63617	63588	63588	Beckett	78	“ She asked me to drive her home because he was drinking so much . I was walking her out when he came after me . ”
63618	63626	63627	63627	I	0	“ Oh yeah . Now I remember . ”
63783	63798	63771	63771	Beckett	78	“ That ’s the only time I ever saw you get in a fight . ”
63799	63807	63812	63812	Beckett	78	“ Was n’t much of a fight . ”
63820	63832	63812	63812	Beckett	78	“ True . So you ’ve kept in touch with Maddie ? ”
63833	63875	63876	63876	He	78	“ For a while , when we first went away to college . Then her mom died , and out of nowhere , she dropped out of school and got married . I did n’t hear from her for a while . ”
63883	63903	63876	63876	He	78	“ But while I was living in Manhattan , she came and stayed with me for a few days . ”
63904	63907	63908	63908	I	0	“ Really ? ”
63915	63922	63908	63908	I	0	“ Did anything happen between you ? ”
63928	63960	63923	63923	He	78	“ She was still married . And actually , she was pregnant . She ended up going back to him , even though I tried to talk her out of it . ”
63961	63968	63969	63969	His	78	“ Why ’d you do that ? ”
63973	63981	63969	63969	His	78	“ Because he did n’t deserve her . ”
63982	63987	63923	63923	He	78	“ Was he abusive ? ”
63988	64008	63923	63923	He	78	“ Not physically . He was just a jerk . They ended up getting divorced about a year ago . ”
64009	64018	63969	63969	His	78	“ So now she ’s a single mom ? ”
64019	64035	63923	63923	He	78	“ Yeah . She ’s got a six - year - old son , Elliott . ”
64036	64039	64040	64040	I	0	“ Huh . ”
64047	64066	64067	64067	Beckett	78	“ Does she live around here ? I do n’t think I ’ve seen her since high school . ”
64072	64124	64069	64069	his	78	“ She lives in Ohio , but she ’s coming up here in a few weeks to sell the house she grew up in . Her mom left it to her , and she ’s been renting it out . Actually , I was going to ask a favor of you . ”
64125	64132	64040	64040	I	0	“ Sure . What is it ? ”
64133	64170	64171	64171	He	78	“ Could you maybe take a look at this house and give her an estimate on some improvements ? The property manager neglected to do any maintenance , and it ’s been vacant for a while . ”
64174	64192	64171	64171	He	78	“ I ’ve looked at it from the outside , and it ’s in pretty bad shape . ”
64198	64207	64193	64193	I	0	“ I can do that . No problem . ”
64208	64219	64220	64220	Beckett	78	“ I do n’t know how much money she has , ”
64230	64256	64220	64220	Beckett	78	“ I ’ll take a look and see what we ’re dealing with . Do n’t worry , I ’ll give her a good price . ”
64257	64265	64266	64266	Beckett	78	“ That ’s what I told her . ”
64276	64281	64272	64272	his	78	“ Thanks , man . ”
64282	64294	64220	64220	Beckett	78	“ Is she going to stay there until it ’s sold ? ”
64295	64306	64307	64307	I	0	“ Actually , she ’s going to stay with me . ”
64314	64322	64323	64323	he	78	“ She was going to stay there , ”
64333	64372	64323	64323	he	78	“ but that place is a wreck . I do n’t think she realizes how bad it is . We ’ve got plenty of room , and she said her son is really excited about visiting a farm . ”
64373	64386	64387	64387	I	0	“ Well , there you go , you can finally bang her , ”
64395	64412	64390	64390	He	78	“ Fuck off , asshole . I ’m just doing something nice for an old friend . ”
64460	64473	64449	64449	he	78	“ She ’ll be here in a few weeks , you said ? ”
64474	64502	64503	64503	I	0	“ Yes , as soon as Elliott is out of school for the summer . I ’ll let you know as soon as I hear from her . ”
64508	64517	64503	64503	I	0	“ You do have a lot going on . ”
64518	64543	64449	64449	he	78	“ Tell me about it . I ’m gon na wake up with white hair one of these mornings , just like my dad . ”
64544	64565	64566	64566	He	78	“ My advice is to get a fake wife and have lots of sex . It ’s excellent stress relief . ”
64569	64613	64566	64566	He	78	“ A wife is the last thing I need , fake or otherwise . I ’ve got enough people to take care of right now , not to mention a herd of cattle , some goats , chickens , horses , a dog — ”
64614	64619	64620	64620	I	0	“ Okay , okay . ”
64628	64643	64620	64620	I	0	“ You win . No wife . How about I buy the next round ? ”
64652	64655	64644	64644	Beckett	78	“ Sold . ”
64693	64734	64690	64690	Beckett	78	“ Hey , if I ever lose my mind and start wandering around town babbling nonsense , do n’t let our kid feel responsible . Put me in a home or something . Just make sure they have good food . ”
64744	64747	64737	64737	her	79	“ What ? ”
64748	64763	64764	64764	I	0	“ Beckett ’s dad has dementia , and Beckett has to deal with it . ”
64791	64795	64796	64796	Bianca	79	“ Poor Beckett , ”
64824	64833	64814	64814	she	79	“ Yeah , I feel bad for him . ”
64834	64841	64814	64814	she	79	“ When did his mom die ? ”
64842	64871	64814	64814	she	79	“ She did n’t die — that I know of , anyway . She just took off when Beck was really young . He never talked about it . ”
64872	64881	64814	64814	she	79	“ Poor thing . Does he have siblings ? ”
64882	64906	64814	64814	she	79	“ He has two older sisters , Mallory and Amy . But they do n’t live close enough to help out every day . ”
64907	64913	64814	64814	she	79	“ Does Beckett ever date ? ”
64914	64957	64958	64958	I	0	“ I think he had a girlfriend for a while in New York , but since he moved back here , there has n’t been anyone serious . He ’s always so busy with the ranch , and now with his dad . ”
64973	65000	64958	64958	I	0	“ In high school , he was always hung up on this one girl — Maddie Blake . Not that he ’d ever admit to it . ”
65001	65004	64814	64814	she	79	“ Yeah ? ”
65005	65037	65038	65038	Bianca	79	“ She lived across the road from the ranch and they had classes together , so she hung around his house a lot , although he claims they only did homework . ”
65041	65060	65038	65038	Bianca	79	“ Which you can not imagine doing , if you were alone with a girl in high school . ”
65061	65064	65065	65065	I	0	“ Precisely . ”
65073	65102	65065	65065	I	0	“ But actually , I believe him . She had a boyfriend , and Beckett was not the kind of guy to go after someone else ’s girlfriend . ”
65103	65111	64814	64814	she	79	“ What was he like back then ? ”
65112	65167	65038	65038	Bianca	79	“ Pretty much the same as he is now . A workaholic . Crazy smart . An awesome athlete . Busy all the time . When he was n’t at school or practice , he was working . He used to get up at fucking five a.m. and milk cows before coming to school . ”
65168	65175	65065	65065	I	0	“ He never had a girlfriend ? ”
65176	65192	64814	64814	she	79	“ Not really . I think he was always hung up on that Maddie girl . ”
65193	65200	65038	65038	Bianca	79	“ And he never told her ? ”
65201	65208	65065	65065	I	0	“ Nope . Not his style . ”
65209	65215	64814	64814	she	79	“ What was she like ? ”
65216	65235	65236	65236	I	0	“ She was nice . Pretty , but not in a super showy way . Kind of quiet . ”
65240	65256	65236	65236	I	0	“ Everyone liked her , but she only dated losers — I never understood it . ”
65260	65273	65257	65257	Bianca	79	“ You never know what ’s going on in someone ’s head . ”
65274	65319	65320	65320	I	0	“ I guess . Anyway , Beckett said she eventually married a loser and had a kid with him . But she ’s divorced now , and she ’d coming back here in a couple weeks to sell the house she grew up in . ”
65347	65355	65356	65356	She	79	“ Aww . Of course you did . ”
65361	65368	65356	65356	She	79	“ You ’re a good friend . ”
65369	65376	65377	65377	Bianca	79	“ Beckett ’s a good guy . ”
65383	65408	65377	65377	Bianca	79	“ Hard to believe a mom could just abandon their child like his mother did , but . . . I guess it happens . ”
65409	65412	65356	65356	She	79	“ Yeah . ”
65413	65433	65440	65440	her	79	“ As intense as our parents can be , we ’re lucky we grew up the way we did . ”
65467	65475	65476	65476	I	0	“ Let me up for a second , ”
65480	65486	65476	65476	I	0	“ I need to stretch . ”
65508	65512	65513	65513	she	79	“ You okay ? ”
65516	65532	65513	65513	she	79	“ I ’m fine . I must have hurt myself at the gym this morning . ”
65572	65585	65586	65586	I	0	“ Do you think we ’re going to fuck up our kid ? ”
65589	65594	65586	65586	I	0	“ What ? No . ”
65599	65606	65595	65595	She	79	“ Why would you say that ? ”
65607	65618	65586	65586	I	0	“ Because we ’re not going to raise it together . ”
65619	65625	65586	65586	I	0	“ Yes , we are . ”
65626	65637	65595	65595	She	79	“ You know what I mean — in one house . ”
65638	65641	65642	65642	She	79	“ Oh . ”
65649	65686	65642	65642	She	79	“ No , I do n’t think we ’re going to fuck up our kid . Plenty of children grow up in two different households . The important thing is that they know they ’re loved . ”
65703	65717	65718	65718	she	79	“ Are you — are you changing your mind about having a baby ? ”
65722	65725	65718	65718	she	79	“ No . ”
65734	65763	65726	65726	I	0	“ No , I ’m still good with the plan . Sorry , I think I ’m just worried about Beckett , and it ’s fucking with me . ”
65764	65772	65773	65773	She	79	“ That ’s okay . I understand . ”
65796	65806	65773	65773	She	79	“ Hey . What are you doing over there ? ”
65807	65820	65773	65773	She	79	“ I do n’t know . I ’m giving you some space . ”
65821	65833	65834	65834	She	79	“ Well , I do n’t want it . Come here . ”
65848	65874	65875	65875	Her	79	“ I just want you to know , and I mean this with one hundred percent sincerity , I ’m not sick of you yet . ”
65885	65895	65875	65875	Her	79	“ I ’m not sick of you yet either . ”
65896	65901	65902	65902	I	0	“ Okay . Good . ”
65942	65950	65951	65951	Cheyenne	79	“ I ’m dying to catch up , ”
65979	65985	65976	65976	Cole	77	“ How are things going ? ”
65986	65989	65990	65990	I	0	“ Good , ”
65993	66002	66004	66004	Blair	115	“ I noticed you ’re not drinking wine , ”
66030	66033	66022	66022	I	0	“ Nope . ”
66034	66043	66044	66044	Cheyenne	79	“ Does that mean you ’re already pregnant ? ”
66049	66052	66053	66053	I	0	“ No , ”
66058	66064	66053	66053	I	0	“ Just trying to be . ”
66071	66098	66065	66065	Blair	115	“ Wait a minute . You told me before that the first insemination would n’t be until late April . It ’s only mid - March . ”
66099	66103	66104	66104	I	0	“ About that . ”
66111	66126	66104	66104	I	0	“ We , um , decided to try it the old - fashioned way . ”
66134	66139	66140	66140	Cheyenne	79	“ Are you serious ? ”
66143	66146	66140	66140	Cheyenne	79	“ Yes . ”
66147	66152	66153	66153	Blair	115	“ I knew it ! ”
66161	66190	66155	66155	her	115	“ I said to Griffin when we left your house on Saturday that you guys would not be able to stick to that ridiculous no - sex rule . ”
66191	66196	66197	66197	I	0	“ You were right , ”
66200	66205	66197	66197	I	0	“ We could n’t . ”
66206	66212	66213	66213	Cheyenne	79	“ I ’m so confused , ”
66223	66238	66213	66213	Cheyenne	79	“ Are you guys actually a couple now ? Or is everything still fake ? ”
66239	66248	66249	66249	I	0	“ I think we ’re something in between , ”
66252	66269	66249	66249	I	0	“ Not a couple , but not entirely fake either . More like friends with benefits . ”
66276	66287	66270	66270	She	79	“ But you ’re still planning to break up eventually ? ”
66288	66308	66213	66213	Cheyenne	79	“ Yes . After the baby is born , if I get pregnant . Sooner if I do n’t . ”
66309	66314	66361	66361	Cheyenne	79	“ Like how soon ? ”
66315	66325	66326	66326	My	0	“ We said we ’d give it three months . ”
66357	66360	66361	66361	Cheyenne	79	“ Wow . ”
66364	66375	66361	66361	Cheyenne	79	“ And you ’ll be able to just walk away ? ”
66376	66379	66380	66380	I	0	“ Sure , ”
66390	66426	66380	66380	I	0	“ That part of the plan has n’t changed . From the very beginning , we agreed on an expiration date . We just adjusted things to have a little more fun in the meantime . ”
66427	66439	66440	66440	Cheyenne	79	“ But what if you really like each other by then ? ”
66443	66452	66440	66440	Cheyenne	79	“ Do n’t you think it could work ? ”
66453	66457	66458	66458	I	0	“ No way , ”
66480	66515	66458	66458	I	0	“ The reason I chose Enzo is because I knew there would be no possible way I ’d ever fall for him . In fact , he made me put that in the contract . ”
66516	66520	66521	66521	Cheyenne	79	“ He did ? ”
66526	66531	66523	66523	her	79	“ What an asshole . ”
66532	66536	66537	66537	I	0	“ I know . ”
66544	66589	66537	66537	I	0	“ And at the time , it seemed ludicrous that he ’d even think it . But he claims he ’s been in this situation before , where someone says she ’s okay with casual fun but then she falls in love with him . ”
66590	66598	66599	66599	Blair	115	“ But you ’re not that girl , ”
66602	66609	66599	66599	Blair	115	“ This is not that situation . ”
66610	66623	66624	66624	I	0	“ No , it ’s not . And it never will be . ”
66631	66678	66624	66624	I	0	“ Look , I appreciate his honesty . I spent years in a relationship letting myself be strung along with empty promises . At least Enzo is being up front about it . He ’s never going to love me . I ’m okay with that . ”
66686	66693	66679	66679	Blair	115	“ She sounds just like you . ”
66694	66697	66698	66698	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
66706	66715	66698	66698	I	0	“ I said that too , about Cole . ”
66720	66730	66716	66716	Cheyenne	79	“ That he was never going to love me . ”
66731	66734	66735	66735	I	0	“ Oh . ”

66775	66826	66773	66773	Blair	115	“ There is n’t one path that leads to love , Bianca . All we ’re saying is that we do n’t think you should completely close yourself off to the idea of finding something real with Enzo . It could happen , even though neither of you expects it . ”

66863	66973	66974	66974	Blair	115	“ We ’re in this for something else entirely . And because I ’m a mature , self - aware woman who has learned from her mistakes , I ’m being one hundred percent careful this time not to get sucked into the fantasy . Yes , we ’re married . But it ’s just a piece of paper for us . Yes , the sex is great . But it ’s just sex . Yes , Enzo is hot and funny and maybe slightly less irksome these days . But I ’m on a mission , and I know what it is — and what it ’s not . ”

67401	67441	67442	67442	He	990	“ I ’m sorry . We ’re behind on this project , and I had to make sure the tile guys did n’t fuck off and leave before the job was done . Then I stopped at the florist . ”

69507	69548	69504	69504	I	0	“ Never . Because I fucking love it when you ’re mad at me . I ’m beginning to understand why my parents fought all the time . I think it was foreplay . No wonder they had six kids . ”

70383	70431	70432	70432	He	990	“ Want to go look at it tomorrow ? It would be a pretty big project . It ’s old as fuck , has some water damage , and has n’t been redecorated since Star Wars was in theaters , but it would be a cool project . ”
70435	70441	70432	70432	He	990	“ If you were interested . ”

71474	71520	71521	71521	He	1021	“ We ’ve been getting along so well all day , I feel like I ’m losing my grip on reality . Or like maybe you ’ve been kidnapped by aliens and I ’m going to give birth to something that looks like Baby Yoda . ”

72101	72116	72117	72117	I	0	“ I ’m going to refrain from making jokes about my awesome long shot . ”
72128	72140	72117	72117	I	0	“ So what ’s next ? When can we try again ? ”
72141	72166	72082	72082	His	1021	“ Well , I ’m going to start Clomid on Monday . Then I think we can try again about ten days after that . ”
72167	72197	72117	72117	I	0	“ Okay . In the meantime , let ’s focus on getting that house , okay ? How about we put in a lowball offer and see what happens ? ”
72201	72204	72208	72208	he	1021	“ Hey . ”
72223	72249	72208	72208	he	1021	“ In ten days , we can try again . And by this time next month , we ’ll be celebrating . I know it . ”
72250	72257	72208	72208	he	1021	“ I hope you ’re right . ”
72258	72266	72267	72267	I	0	“ I ’m always right . Remember ? ”
72273	72279	72267	72267	I	0	“ How could I forget ? ”
72280	72296	72303	72303	he	1021	“ I do n’t know . You ’re not too bright sometimes . Come here . ”
72321	72339	72303	72303	he	1021	“ Let ’s go out for dinner tonight . I ’ll even let you choose the place . ”
72340	72343	72351	72351	him	1021	“ Okay . ”
72530	72538	72539	72539	I	0	“ Want to watch TV or anything ? ”
72543	72550	72551	72551	she	79	“ Nah . I ’m tired , ”
72554	72565	72551	72551	she	79	“ I think I ’ll just head up to bed . ”
72566	72575	72576	72576	I	0	“ Okay . I ’ll go up too . ”
72602	72610	72611	72611	I	0	“ Whoa . You lost or what ? ”
72624	72632	72611	72611	I	0	“ It ’s this way , Columbus . ”
72633	72645	72656	72656	her	79	“ Well , I was n’t sure where I should sleep . ”
72646	72651	72652	72652	I	0	“ What ? Why ? ”
72667	72720	72663	72663	She	79	“ Well , because we can’t — we do n’t need to — there wo n’t be sex for a while . So I thought maybe I should sleep in the other room , the one I was supposed to use . Most of my clothes are still in there and everything . ”
72732	72743	72726	72726	I	0	“ Do you want to sleep in the other room ? ”
72775	72784	72760	72760	I	0	“ It ’s an easy question , Bianca . ”
72785	72792	72793	72793	she	79	“ No , it is n’t , ”
72802	72826	72793	72793	she	79	“ What ’s so difficult about it ? Do you want to sleep in here with me or alone in the other room ? ”
72837	72855	72856	72856	I	0	“ It ’s not really fair of you to ask me that question when you ’re shirtless . ”
72859	72862	72856	72856	I	0	“ No ? ”
72863	72871	72834	72834	her	79	“ No . It clouds my judgement . ”
72872	72880	72881	72881	I	0	“ What about when I do this ? ”
72896	72900	72881	72881	I	0	“ Or this ? ”
72919	72925	72901	72901	I	0	“ Can you think now ? ”
72935	72940	72930	72930	she	79	“ You ’re ridiculous . ”
72941	72952	72953	72953	Her	79	“ I know . But you ca n’t resist me . ”
72958	72971	72953	72953	Her	79	“ Oh , I think I can . In fact , goodnight . ”
73002	73010	73011	73011	I	0	“ You ’re the one being ridiculous . ”
73017	73023	73011	73011	I	0	“ Just stay in here . ”
73024	73034	73035	73035	she	79	“ Do you want me to stay in here ? ”
73039	73057	73058	73058	She	79	“ I do n’t know . Maybe you should take off your shirt and ask me again . ”
73061	73091	73058	73058	She	79	“ Listen , I ’m just trying to stick as close to the original arrangement as possible . I feel like we ’ve mucked things up so much already . ”
73194	73205	73206	73206	I	0	“ I still think you should just stay in here , ”
73210	73230	73206	73206	I	0	“ It seems stupid for you to go back and forth . Plus I like sleeping next to you . ”
73231	73235	73236	73236	She	79	“ You do ? ”
73240	73273	73236	73236	She	79	“ Yes . Sleeping Bianca is my favorite . She smells just as good as Awake Bianca , but she never rolls her eyes and she does n’t give me any lip . ”
73274	73306	73307	73307	I	0	“ Sleeping Enzo is nice too . All of the muscles , none of the attitude . Although , he does snore , so it ’s a bit of a tradeoff . ”
73313	73319	73307	73307	I	0	“ So will you stay ? ”
73339	73346	73336	73336	she	79	“ Yes . I ’ll stay . ”
73347	73350	73351	73351	I	0	“ Good . ”
73373	73376	73362	73362	I	0	“ Enzo . ”
73413	73417	73418	73418	she	79	“ Thank you , ”
73524	73527	73528	73528	she	79	“ No , ”
73561	73568	73545	73545	her	79	“ It ’s only been five . ”
73569	73575	73528	73528	she	79	“ But it ’s Friday . ”
73576	73579	73528	73528	she	79	“ So ? ”
73580	73591	73528	73528	she	79	“ So usually we do fun things on Friday nights . ”
73592	73605	73528	73528	she	79	“ We did do a fun thing . We made homemade ravioli . ”
73606	73639	73640	73640	She	79	“ Yes , and while that was more fun than I thought it would be , it still does not compare to the kind of fun I am thinking of right now . ”
73683	73695	73674	73674	I	0	“ How about now ? Has it been ten days yet ? ”
73696	73705	73706	73706	I	0	“ Nope . It ’s only been seven . ”
73733	73754	73720	73720	She	79	“ Are you sure ? Because I really think it ’s been at least ten days . Maybe even twenty . ”
73755	73762	73763	73763	She	79	“ Yes , I ’m sure . ”
73771	73792	73763	73763	She	79	“ But I ’m glad you ’re so eager to get back on the job . Your dedication is inspiring . ”
73802	73826	73793	73793	I	0	“ Frankly , these workplace conditions are appalling . I ’m suffering from some kind of work - related mental and emotional stress . ”
73846	73854	73843	73843	her	79	“ How about some workman ’s compensation ? ”
73861	73869	73859	73859	her	79	“ What did you have in mind ? ”
73887	73897	73870	73870	Her	79	“ I ’m sure we can work something out . ”
73898	73903	73908	73908	she	79	“ Are you serious ? ”
73926	73932	73908	73908	she	79	“ Do I look serious ? ”
73933	73939	73940	73940	I	0	“ You look fucking hot , ”
73951	73959	73960	73960	She	79	“ And this feels like Christmas morning . ”
74227	74232	74233	74233	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
74243	74252	74253	74253	She	79	“ That was fucking incredible . Marry me . ”
74256	74262	74253	74253	She	79	“ We ’re already married . ”
74263	74267	74268	74268	I	0	“ Oh yeah . ”
74412	74428	74398	74398	She	79	“ So how was that ? Good enough to tide you over until Wednesday night ? ”
74545	74555	74556	74556	I	0	“ Tell me what I can do for you , ”
74591	74594	74585	74585	She	79	“ Nothing . ”
74595	74600	74601	74601	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
74606	74614	74601	74601	I	0	“ I ’m really good with my — ”
74615	74620	74621	74621	she	79	“ I ’m sure , ”
74636	74661	74626	74626	she	79	“ I know you ’re really good with your everything , but I can wait . Technically , we just broke the rules anyway . ”
74662	74678	74679	74679	I	0	“ What do you mean ? We got rid of the no - sex rule , ”
74691	74703	74704	74704	she	79	“ We got rid of it for the purpose of conception , ”
74707	74725	74704	74704	she	79	“ What we just did was fun , but it ’s not going to get me pregnant . ”
74726	74729	74730	74730	I	0	“ True . ”
74741	74752	74753	74753	She	79	“ So you ’re saying that was fun for you ? ”
74756	74796	74753	74753	She	79	“ Yes , that was fun for me . But do n’t let it go to your head . I mostly did it so that you ’d stop bothering me — until Wednesday anyway . Now go to sleep . ”
74895	74898	74899	74899	I	0	“ Sure , ”
74909	74927	74899	74899	I	0	“ Let me just text Bianca and let her know I ’ll be a little bit late . ”
74984	74994	74995	74995	Cole	77	“ So how ’s everything going with you guys ? ”
75007	75010	74995	74995	Cole	77	“ Good . ”
75078	75120	75070	75070	I	0	“ She did n’t get pregnant last month , so she was upset about that , but other than that , it ’s been good . We ’re actually getting along pretty well . Much better than I thought we would . ”
75121	75126	75127	75127	he	1060	“ That ’s cool , ”
75130	75137	75127	75127	he	1060	“ Sorry about the other thing . ”
75138	75143	75144	75144	I	0	“ It ’s okay . ”
75147	75185	75144	75144	I	0	“ She knew it probably would n’t happen that fast . I do n’t know shit about that stuff — apparently you have to time it exactly right , and even then the chances are n’t great . ”
75186	75196	75197	75197	Cole	77	“ I do n’t know much about it either , ”
75200	75208	75197	75197	Cole	77	“ Trisha got pregnant almost right away . ”
75209	75220	75144	75144	I	0	“ Yeah , I guess some people just get lucky . ”
75233	75241	75242	75242	Cole	77	“ Unless I ’m doing it wrong . ”
75249	75271	75246	75246	his	1060	“ It ’s not that . I remember it took my brother ’s wife a while too . Almost a year . ”
75272	75278	75279	75279	I	0	“ A year ? Shit . ”
75284	75299	75279	75279	I	0	“ She only gave me three months , and I ’m down one already . ”
75300	75309	75310	75310	I	0	“ Ca n’t you give yourselves more time ? ”
75321	75331	75310	75310	I	0	“ I do n’t think that ’s an option . ”
75332	75336	75279	75279	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
75337	75358	75279	75279	I	0	“ We agreed from the start that this was temporary . We said three months , unless she got pregnant . ”
75359	75369	75370	75370	Cole	77	“ You also said you would n’t have sex , ”
75374	75389	75370	75370	Cole	77	“ If that part of your plan can change , why not the timeline ? ”
75390	75396	75397	75397	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
75400	75411	75397	75397	I	0	“ I just feel like that ’s a bad idea . ”
75412	75415	75279	75279	I	0	“ Why ? ”
75416	75519	75520	75520	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Like what if it still wo n’t work , and month after month , we ’re just stuck with each other , no end in sight , and she starts to hate me for letting her down and I start to regret putting myself in this position , where I ’m failing a wife I did n’t even want in the first place , and all we do is fight and get on each other ’s nerves , and then she leaves , because we ruined everything , and we hate each other forever . . . ”
75533	75544	75520	75520	I	0	“ Fuck . Just . . . fuck . No . ”
75545	75553	75554	75554	Cole	77	“ When you put it that way , ”
75557	75566	75567	75567	He	1065	“ it ’s tough to argue with you . ”
75570	75580	75567	75567	He	1065	“ But what if it went the other way ? ”
75581	75591	75520	75520	I	0	“ You mean , what if she gets pregnant ? ”
75592	75608	75567	75567	He	1065	“ Sure , let ’s say she does . You ’d still let her leave ? ”
75617	75654	75520	75520	I	0	“ I ’d have to , if she wanted to go . It ’s what I agreed to . And why would I want to be with someone who did n’t want to be with me ? ”
75655	75660	75520	75520	I	0	“ But what if — ”
75661	75666	75667	75667	I	0	“ Okay , stop . ”
75683	75756	75667	75667	I	0	“ You ’re making this complicated when it is n’t . There ’s no sense in asking what if questions . If she does n’t get pregnant , we shake hands and get a divorce in two months . If she does , we shake hands and get a divorce in a year . That was the deal . It ’s the only way we do n’t end up hating each other . ”
75781	75786	75787	75787	Mariah	80	“ Hi , Daddy , ”
75803	75814	75815	75815	Cole	77	“ Guess what ? We ’re making pancakes for dinner ! ”
75822	75826	75815	75815	Cole	77	“ My favorite . ”
75827	75833	75834	75834	Mariah	80	“ Hi , Uncle Enzo . ”
75839	75844	75834	75834	Mariah	80	“ Hey , squirt . ”
75874	75894	75895	75895	She	80	“ You ’re getting so tall . Pretty soon I wo n’t even be able to call you squirt . ”
75900	75903	75895	75895	She	80	“ Good ! ”
75904	75909	75910	75910	Cheyenne	79	“ Hey , Enzo , ”
75927	75936	75910	75910	Cheyenne	79	“ Would you like to stay for dinner ? ”
75937	75960	75895	75895	She	80	“ Much as I love pancakes , I ca n’t , but thanks for asking . I ’m bringing home dinner tonight . ”
75961	75967	75968	75968	she	80	“ Such a good husband , ”
75975	75981	75968	75968	she	80	“ Who ’d have guessed ? ”
75988	76008	75982	75982	I	0	“ Alright , I ’m out of here , before the abuse gets any worse . Bye , guys . ”
76255	76269	76240	76240	I	0	“ Come on , it ’s so close . Ca n’t we try ? ”
76270	76273	76274	76274	she	79	“ No , ”
76277	76287	76274	76274	she	79	“ It ’s not time . One more night . ”
76288	76293	76294	76294	I	0	“ Is it me , ”
76298	76315	76294	76294	I	0	“ or are these last couple days somehow way longer than twenty - four hours apiece ? ”
76316	76321	76274	76274	she	79	“ They ’re not . ”
76322	76331	76332	76332	I	0	“ Maybe we should at least rehearse tonight . ”
76343	76356	76332	76332	I	0	“ You know , make sure we remember how to do it . ”
76362	76394	76359	76359	her	79	“ Nope . We have to time this perfectly . According to my predictor kit and the doctor ’s instructions , tomorrow is best , so we ’re waiting until tomorrow . ”
76395	76404	76405	76405	I	0	“ But we can do it tomorrow too . ”
76414	76418	76419	76419	She	79	“ No way . ”
76424	76446	76419	76419	She	79	“ We can only do it every other day . Too much sex can decrease the number of gold medal swimmers . ”
76468	76471	76472	76472	I	0	“ Fine , ”
76475	76480	76472	76472	I	0	“ I ’ll wait . ”
76481	76485	76461	76461	her	79	“ Thank you . ”
76486	76512	76515	76515	her	79	“ But it wo n’t be easy . You ’ve got this very angry librarian thing happening right now . It ’s turning me on . ”
76530	76533	76518	76518	She	79	“ Good . ”
76591	76598	76599	76599	she	79	“ I ’ll be right there , ”
76602	76610	76611	76611	I	0	“ You do n’t have to come , ”
76615	76656	76611	76611	I	0	“ They said he only lost consciousness briefly and just needs an X - ray . I ’m sure he ’s fine , and it ’s in the middle of your workday . Do n’t you have meetings this afternoon ? ”
76657	76662	76663	76663	she	79	“ I ’m canceling , ”
76666	76677	76663	76663	she	79	“ I ’ll be there as soon as I can . ”
76763	76823	76757	76757	Bianca	79	“ Because , Ma , they already told us , they ’re short a radiologist today and it ’s taking longer to get results . They said it would be a few hours , and they ’re sorry for the delay . Those people brought in someone having an asthma attack who did n’t need an X - ray . ”
76836	76839	76840	76840	she	1732	“ Hey , ”
76847	76851	76840	76840	she	1732	“ Any news ? ”
76881	76885	76886	76886	She	1732	“ Not yet . ”
76892	76897	76886	76886	She	1732	“ How are you ? ”
76898	76903	76904	76905	my mother	261	“ I ’m angry , ”
76909	76914	76904	76905	my mother	261	“ At the doctors ? ”
76915	76935	76936	76936	She	1732	“ Yes , and at Carlo ! He had no business being up on a ladder at his age ! ”
76947	76958	76943	76943	Bianca	79	“ Why do n’t I get us all some coffee ? ”
76959	76995	77025	77025	my	0	“ Thank you , dear . That sounds perfect . We have n’t wanted to leave in case one of these doctors decides we ’re worth his time and comes out to talk to us . ”
76996	77002	77003	77003	She	79	“ I ’ll get it . ”
77008	77015	77003	77003	She	79	“ I ’ll be right back . ”

77037	77047	77048	77049	my mother	261	“ She ’s a gem , is n’t she ? ”
77052	77056	77057	77057	I	0	“ She is , ”

77178	77225	77226	77226	She	79	“ By doing something I ’ve told him a million times he should n’t do ! He knows damn well he does n’t have the balance anymore , and that he ’ll fall and cause me to have a heart attack when I hear the news ! ”
77231	77258	77226	77226	She	79	“ Do n’t laugh at me . You know it ’s the truth . He does things like this on purpose just to make me mad ! ”
77266	77271	77259	77259	I	0	“ This is why . ”
77287	77292	77278	77278	she	79	“ I get it . ”

77526	77543	77512	77512	She	79	“ And if — if you do n’t feel like trying tonight , I would understand . ”

77553	77576	77548	77548	I	0	“ You go upstairs and relax . Take a bubble bath or something . I ’ll be up in a little bit . ”

77584	77593	77581	77581	she	79	“ But I mean it . No pressure . ”
77594	77599	77600	77600	I	0	“ I heard you . ”
77605	77615	77600	77600	I	0	“ Now go do what I said , woman . ”
78551	78554	78544	78544	I	0	“ Enzo ? ”
78567	78570	78571	78571	I	0	“ Enzo ? ”
78614	78620	78621	78621	he	81	“ Enzo is not here , ”
78650	78655	78645	78645	I	0	“ And you are ? ”
78656	78665	78666	78666	He	81	“ I am Edward Mullins , of course . ”

78681	78715	78645	78645	I	0	“ Yes , sorry . I have been in a deep slumber for so long , I forgot my last name . But when I smelled your blood , I grew very thirsty . ”
78716	78725	78645	78645	I	0	“ You can smell my blood , huh ? ”
78726	78731	78666	78666	He	81	“ But of course . ”
78732	78748	78645	78645	I	0	“ That’s — that ’s quite an outfit you ’ve got on there , Edward . ”
78749	78755	78756	78756	He	81	“ Do you like it ? ”
78771	78783	78756	78756	He	81	“ I was n’t sure if capes were still in fashion . ”
78793	78800	78785	78785	he	81	“ Or do you mean this ? ”
78811	78817	78801	78801	I	0	“ I like it all . ”
78818	78821	78822	78822	He	81	“ Good . ”
78838	78855	78835	78835	he	81	“ I have not seen such beauty in centuries . I must have you or die . ”
78880	78891	78859	78859	he	81	“ Ow ! Can you take those things out please ? ”
78892	78897	78898	78898	He	81	“ If you insist . ”

78931	78942	78923	78923	I	0	“ Do you want to take your cape off too ? ”
78943	78947	78948	78948	His	81	“ That depends . ”
78975	78989	78957	78957	he	81	“ Will you still want me when I look like a mere mortal ? ”
79007	79019	79000	79000	his	81	“ Enzo , you have never looked like a mere mortal . ”
79020	79025	79026	79026	He	81	“ In that case . ”
79050	79065	79043	79043	his	81	“ Yes , this is much better . God , I ’ve missed you . ”
79240	79243	79244	79244	I	0	“ Enzo , ”

79901	79907	79882	79882	I	0	“ How was your workout ? ”
79908	79937	79964	79964	my	0	“ Great . I stopped for coffee on the way home . Got you some tea , and do n’t worry — it ’s herbal . No caffeine . ”
79938	79943	79944	79944	I	0	“ Does n’t matter , ”
79951	79954	79944	79944	I	0	“ Huh ? ”

80073	80076	80077	80077	he	81	“ Shh , ”
80084	80089	80077	80077	he	81	“ It ’s okay . ”
80090	80095	80096	80096	I	0	“ It ’s not , ”
80109	80121	80096	80096	I	0	“ I failed . Even on the drug , I failed . ”
80122	80133	80077	80077	he	81	“ That ’s ridiculous . If anything , I failed . ”
80134	80156	80096	80096	I	0	“ It ’s me , Enzo . You had the test , and you were fine . I ’m the problem . ”
80157	80160	80161	80161	He	81	“ Hey . ”
80180	80197	80161	80161	He	81	“ This was one missed chance , that ’s all . We get more , right ? ”
80209	80213	80198	80198	I	0	“ One more . ”
80214	80235	80236	80236	His	81	“ Okay , so do n’t give up . You know what they say , third time ’s the charm . ”
80244	80247	80236	80236	His	81	“ Right ? ”
80306	80309	80310	80310	he	81	“ Right ? ”
80314	80317	80310	80310	he	81	“ Right . ”
80389	80411	80384	80384	He	81	“ I forgot to tell you , my nephew James ’s fourth birthday party is tomorrow afternoon at Pietro ’s house . ”
80412	80417	80418	80418	I	0	“ Sounds like fun , ”
80553	80565	80566	80566	I	0	“ We can pick something up for James in town today , ”
80573	80613	80566	80566	I	0	“ Good idea . I was thinking of getting him a baseball glove and maybe a batting tee . He starts tee ball next month , and Pietro sucks at baseball , so I figure I better teach him . ”
80619	80623	80566	80566	I	0	“ Of course . ”
80624	80631	80632	80632	He	1159	“ You gon na be okay ? ”
80643	80646	80632	80632	He	1159	“ Yes . ”
80653	80664	80647	80647	I	0	“ Sorry . I made a mess of your shirt . ”
80665	80691	80632	80632	He	1159	“ Fuck my shirt . I ’m a mess anyway . How about I shower up really quick and we hit the diner for breakfast ? ”
80692	80698	80699	80699	I	0	“ Or maybe the bakery , ”
80715	80720	80699	80699	I	0	“ You got it . ”
80760	80765	80766	80766	she	115	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
80773	80787	80766	80766	she	115	“ And do n’t say nothing because I can tell there ’s something . ”
80788	80795	80796	80796	I	0	“ I got my period today , ”
80806	80809	80810	80810	She	115	“ Oh . ”
80814	80819	80810	80810	She	115	“ I ’m sorry . ”
80820	80825	80826	80826	I	0	“ It ’s okay . ”
80831	80848	80826	80826	I	0	“ We can try again next month . I ’ll start another round of Clomid Monday . ”
80849	80870	80810	80810	She	115	“ Let me know if you need anything . An ear to rant into , a shoulder to cry on . ”
80871	80874	80875	80875	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
80895	80904	80889	80889	He	1163	“ I cried all over Enzo this morning . ”
80905	80908	80909	80909	She	115	“ Yeah ? ”
80917	80925	80909	80909	She	115	“ How are things with you guys ? ”
80926	80933	80934	80934	I	0	“ Good . They ’re good . ”
80945	80958	80934	80934	I	0	“ We ’re picking up the keys to the new house today . ”
80964	80975	80959	80959	Her	115	“ That ’s exciting ! When will the renovation begin ? ”
80976	80983	80984	80984	I	0	“ Right away , I hope . ”
80998	81011	80984	80984	I	0	“ I could use the distraction . I think we both could . ”
81012	81021	80959	80959	Her	115	“ Was Enzo sad about the . . . ”
81022	81025	81026	81026	I	0	“ Yes , ”
81029	81037	81026	81026	I	0	“ But he ’s been really sweet . ”
81038	81065	80959	80959	Her	115	“ Of course he has . He ’s not an asshole . And he genuinely cares about you , Bianca . No matter what you think . ”
81074	81088	80959	80959	Her	115	“ We ’re actually getting along much better than I thought we would . ”
81089	81092	80959	80959	Her	115	“ Really ? ”
81093	81101	81102	81102	I	0	“ Yes . In fact . . . ”
81114	81123	81102	81102	I	0	“ I ’m kind of worried about it . ”
81124	81127	80959	80959	Her	115	“ Why ? ”
81128	81169	80959	80959	Her	115	“ Well , because the longer we live together , the better I get to know him , the more sex we have — the closer I feel to him . He ’s not the guy I thought he was . ”
81170	81173	81174	81174	I	0	“ No ? ”
81179	81236	81176	81176	my	0	“ No . In fact , he ’s shown himself to be incredibly kind and understanding through all this fertility stuff . I mean , do n’t get me wrong , he can still be a cocky bastard , and he loves to get under my skin , but he ’s actually a really good husband . ”
81242	81251	81237	81237	Her	1164	“ Any chance you guys might stay together ? ”
81252	81255	81256	81256	I	0	“ No , ”
81260	81269	81256	81256	I	0	“ There ’s been no talk about that . ”
81270	81304	81237	81237	Her	1164	“ Well , maybe you should talk about it . After all , things have changed since you guys drew up that ridiculous contract . Maybe you can give yourselves some more time . ”
81305	81314	81315	81315	I	0	“ More time would just make it worse , ”
81319	81335	81315	81315	I	0	“ If it does n’t work this next month , I have to walk away . ”
81336	81345	81346	81346	She	1164	“ Without even telling him how you feel ? ”
81351	81354	81346	81346	She	1164	“ Why ? ”
81355	81398	81399	81399	My	0	“ Because the last time I opened myself up to someone like that , it ended with my heart shattered into a million pieces . This arrangement with Enzo was supposed to guard against that . He was supposed to be safe . ”
81404	81432	81399	81399	My	0	“ But how do you know he is n’t ? I think you should be honest with him . Men are n’t mind readers , you know . ”
81700	81707	81708	81708	Pietro	45	“ So how ’s newlywed life ? ”
81751	81756	81757	81757	I	0	“ Good . Great . ”
81773	81795	81796	81796	She	40	“ Your wedding dress was so cute . Of course , everything is cute on you . You ’re so petite . ”
81806	81812	81798	81798	her	40	“ I ’m a whale . ”
81813	81828	81798	81798	her	40	“ Not at all . You look fantastic . When are you due again ? ”
81829	81849	81851	81851	she	40	“ May twenty - fourth . So I still have four weeks left , if you can believe it . ”
81854	81861	81851	81851	she	40	“ But I should n’t complain . ”
81877	81882	81873	81873	I	0	“ It ’s okay . ”
81883	81891	81892	81892	she	40	“ Actually , I love being pregnant , ”
81896	81917	81892	81892	she	40	“ I ’m not one of those women so concerned about her figure that they worry pregnancy will ruin it . ”
81952	81974	81975	81975	She	40	“ I just think it ’s the greatest gift , you know ? Such a miracle . Good job , honey ! ”
82027	82038	82039	82039	she	40	“ Enzo has always been so sweet to the kids , ”
82043	82051	82039	82039	she	40	“ He ’d make a great dad . ”
82052	82058	82059	82059	I	0	“ Yes , he would . ”
82158	82164	82165	82165	Lynne	40	“ See what I mean ? ”
82176	82184	82165	82165	Lynne	40	“ You guys should totally have kids . ”
82185	82191	82192	82192	I	0	“ So we ’ve heard , ”
82202	82236	82192	82192	I	0	“ Let me guess — Mama Moretti is already on you about it . I was n’t married to Pietro for ten minutes before she asked me when I planned on getting pregnant . ”
82244	82265	82237	82237	She	40	“ Luckily , it happened on my wedding night , can you believe it ? We were n’t even trying ! ”
82266	82279	82165	82165	Lynne	40	“ Wow . That is lucky . You have a beautiful family . ”
82280	82348	82349	82349	She	40	“ Thank you . You will too someday . But do n’t wait too long . My sister ’s best friend Anna — she ’s an E.R. doctor — was always too busy to date and found herself still single at almost forty . She tried to get pregnant with a sperm donor , but it was too late . Her eggs were bad quality by then . ”
82355	82375	82351	82351	her	40	“ They never tell you that , do they ? That your eggs have a sell - by date . ”
82385	82399	82376	82376	I	0	“ I need to use the bathroom real quick . Be right back . ”
82410	82415	82424	82424	Enzo	42	“ Hey , you . ”
82429	82435	82424	82424	Enzo	42	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
82436	82441	82442	82442	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
82445	82511	82442	82442	I	0	“ Except that I know you , and you ’re not fine . You ’re wearing your Very Serious Face , the one you make when the sauce is n’t quite right and you ca n’t figure out what you need more of , and you ’re hoping you do n’t need less of something , because there ’s nothing to be done about that . ”
82517	82520	82512	82512	I	0	“ Ha . ”
82521	82529	82530	82530	He	1188	“ Come on . Talk to me . ”
82535	82552	82530	82530	He	1188	“ You signed a contract saying you would n’t make me read your mind , remember ? ”
82553	82559	82512	82512	I	0	“ I remember the contract . ”
82579	82588	82572	82572	I	0	“ Are you still upset about this morning ? ”
82589	82592	82607	82607	He	1188	“ Yes . ”
82740	82750	82751	82751	I	0	“ Lynne said something that made me feel bad , ”
82754	82760	82751	82751	I	0	“ What did she say ? ”
82761	82818	82723	82723	him	1188	“ Nothing awful . It was just the wrong day to tell me how much she loves being pregnant , what a miracle it is , what a great dad you ’ll make , how her sister ’s friend waited too long to try to have a baby and never could because her eggs got old . ”
82819	82829	82830	82830	He	1188	“ Why is she saying that shit to you ? ”
82834	82852	82853	82853	I	0	“ It ’s just how women talk . She did n’t mean to make me feel bad , ”
82874	82915	82858	82858	his	1188	“ Half the women in your family — and mine too — love to ask me when we ’re going to have kids . Sometimes it ’s a struggle to keep the smile on my face and evade the question . ”
82916	82926	82928	82928	Enzo	42	“ They should all fucking mind their own business , ”
82930	82945	82928	82928	Enzo	42	“ And I ’m going to tell them so next time I see them . ”
82952	82962	82946	82946	I	0	“ No , do n’t . It ’s okay . ”
82963	82977	82989	82989	him	1192	“ It is n’t . Anyone who messes with you messes with me . ”
83182	83231	83177	83177	I	0	“ Special rule for Bianca : No falling in love with Enzo Moretti , and if you forget for one moment what a cocky , arrogant , egotistical , presumptuous , swaggering ass he is , just come back and look at this list ! ! ! ! ! ”
83372	83379	83365	83365	Enzo	42	“ Bianca ? Are you okay ? ”
83393	83398	83399	83399	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
83410	83417	83399	83399	I	0	“ Be out in a minute . ”
83866	83871	83872	83872	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
83875	83899	83872	83872	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m really tired , so I ’m just going to heat up some leftovers and go to bed early . ”
83900	83920	83922	83922	she	79	“ Okay . Let me know if you change your mind and want company . I could make dinner . ”
84032	84037	84021	84021	I	0	“ Sorry , what ? ”
84038	84045	84046	84046	Griffin	76	“ What ’s with you tonight ? ”
84049	84057	84046	84046	Griffin	76	“ You seem kinda out of it . ”
84058	84075	84076	84076	I	0	“ Just — just thinking about all the shit I have to get done this weekend . ”
84090	84115	84076	84076	I	0	“ Anyone feels like tearing up carpet , removing wallpaper , and ripping out cabinets , come on over to the new house tomorrow . ”
84116	84121	84122	84122	Cole	77	“ I can help , ”
84125	84131	84122	84122	Cole	77	“ I ’m off tomorrow . ”
84132	84135	84137	84137	Beckett	78	“ Same , ”
84139	84167	84137	84137	Beckett	78	“ My sister ’s in town , so I should be able to get away for a while . She can keep an eye on my dad . ”
84168	84174	84176	84176	Griffin	76	“ I ’ll come too , ”
84178	84188	84176	84176	Griffin	76	“ Probably around one , after the garage closes . ”
84189	84194	84137	84137	Beckett	78	“ Thanks , guys . ”
84224	84237	84216	84216	he	76	“ Blair keeps saying this week how worried she is about her . ”
84241	84257	84238	84238	I	0	“ Yeah , she , uh , did n’t get pregnant this month . Again . ”
84258	84261	84216	84216	he	76	“ Oh . ”
84262	84269	84216	84216	he	76	“ She took it really hard . ”
84270	84278	84238	84238	I	0	“ Ca n’t you just keep trying ? ”
84279	84285	84286	84286	I	0	“ That ’s the plan . ”
84294	84342	84286	84286	I	0	“ But I get the feeling she ’s not all that hopeful anymore . And I feel so fucking bad , you know ? I want to be able to give her what she wants . I hate when there ’s a problem I ca n’t fix . ”
84343	84364	84238	84238	I	0	“ Same . But I do n’t think we can compare this to a blown tire or a kitchen remodel . ”
84365	84372	84373	84373	I	0	“ No , we ca n’t , ”
84376	84420	84373	84373	I	0	“ It just sucks to see her this way . Is it weird that I like it better when she ’s arguing with me or telling me what an egotistical dickhead I am ? She does n’t even seem like the same person . ”
84421	84434	84238	84238	I	0	“ Maybe she just needs some time to work through the disappointment . ”
84435	84485	84238	84238	I	0	“ We do n’t really have time . I ’m telling you , this fertility stuff is such bullshit . You have to be so precise with the timing , and even then it might not work . What if I ca n’t deliver on the promise I made ? ”
84486	84501	84502	84502	He	1220	“ Then I guess you guys get a divorce and go your separate ways . ”
84507	84514	84502	84502	He	1220	“ Was n’t that the plan ? ”
84515	84536	84238	84238	I	0	“ It was , but — I feel like I ’m abandoning her or something . It ’s fucked up . ”
84537	84554	84238	84238	I	0	“ Do you want to stay married even if she does n’t get pregnant this month ? ”
84560	84643	84238	84238	I	0	“ I do n’t know . If you ’d have asked me a week ago , I might have said something different . We were having so much fun — she was happy . I was happy . There was a part of me that thought maybe we should stay together , but then this week is the total opposite . I feel angry and useless and pretty fucking miserable . Not as miserable as she is , but Christ . . . ”
84649	84709	84644	84644	I	0	“ I ’m remembering all the reasons why I never wanted to get married in the first place . She ’s not talking to me . I have no idea if she wants me around or not . I ’m too anxious to even touch her . We ’re not fighting , but I even miss the goddamn fights . ”
84710	84734	84735	84735	Griffin	76	“ I ’m sorry , man . I wish I had some advice . Somehow I figured it out , but . . . ”
84743	84757	84735	84735	Griffin	76	“ I feel like Blair must have done a lot of the work . ”
84758	84765	84766	84766	I	0	“ But how did you know ? ”
84769	84808	84766	84766	I	0	“ Seriously , how did you know you could do it , the whole marriage thing , just you and her for the rest of your lives ? How did you know you would be good at it ? ”
84809	84814	84815	84815	he	76	“ I did n’t , ”
84821	84841	84815	84815	he	76	“ But it was either try it or lose her , and I knew I could n’t lose her . ”
84852	84882	84842	84842	I	0	“ I thought I ’d like the certainty of knowing it would end at a certain point . Now it feels like the clock is ticking faster every day . ”
84883	84888	84766	84766	I	0	“ So what now ? ”
84889	84954	84955	84955	Griffin	76	“ I think we can try again middle of next week . She takes this pill for five days , which she ’s doing now , and then we wait for five days , then we have sex every other day for like a week . I ’m telling you , it ’s like a fucking math problem trying to get this woman pregnant . ”
84958	84963	84955	84955	Griffin	76	“ Sounds like it . ”
85238	85241	85242	85242	I	0	“ Hey , ”
85272	85278	85242	85242	I	0	“ I brought you something . ”
85290	85295	85284	85284	she	79	“ What ’s this ? ”
85296	85302	85303	85303	I	0	“ It ’s a picnic , ”
85306	85326	85303	85303	I	0	“ to celebrate our seven - week anniversary . I bet you did n’t even realize it was today . ”
85327	85332	85333	85333	she	79	“ I did n’t , ”
85345	85381	85333	85333	she	79	“ Well , lucky for you , I ’m a romantic . And nothing says Happy Fake Seven Week Anniversary like some delicious jampagne and chocolate that ’s probably left over from Valentine ’s Day . ”
85388	85396	85397	85397	I	0	“ Who could say no to that ? ”
85432	85435	85425	85425	Bianca	79	“ Impressive . ”
85436	85449	85450	85450	I	0	“ What did I tell you about my long shot , babe ? ”
85462	85474	85475	85475	She	79	“ I think that means our luck is about to change . ”
85502	85525	85526	85526	I	0	“ To seven weeks of wedded bliss . May the next seven be as fruitful as a glass of sparkling strawberry jampagne . ”
85533	85536	85537	85537	she	79	“ Cheers , ”
85573	85576	85577	85577	She	79	“ Mmm . ”
85580	85583	85577	85577	She	79	“ Mmm . ”
85594	85606	85584	85584	I	0	“ Here . Because nothing goes with sugar like more sugar . ”
85607	85611	85612	85612	She	79	“ Thank you . ”
85620	85623	85612	85612	She	79	“ Well ? ”
85624	85627	85628	85628	I	0	“ Delicious . ”
85631	85655	85628	85628	I	0	“ And all this time I ’ve been spending money on the good stuff when you ’re happy with drugstore wine and candy . ”
85667	85676	85664	85664	her	79	“ How was your night with the guys ? ”
85677	85680	85681	85681	I	0	“ Good . ”
85694	85711	85681	85681	I	0	“ They ’re going to come over to the house tomorrow and give us a hand . ”
85712	85717	85664	85664	her	79	“ Oh , nice . ”
85718	85733	85734	85734	She	79	“ I figure we can get the kitchen torn out with the extra muscle . ”
85737	85771	85734	85734	She	79	“ Sounds good . I ’m hoping to get all that wallpaper in the front hall removed over the next few days . I ’m afraid to see how many layers there are . ”
85783	85791	85772	85772	I	0	“ Do n’t do anything too strenuous . ”
85792	85796	85734	85734	She	79	“ Why not ? ”
85797	85807	85772	85772	I	0	“ Because you need to take care of yourself . ”
85808	85812	85813	85813	I	0	“ For what ? ”
85816	85829	85813	85813	I	0	“ What do you mean , for what ? For the baby . ”
85840	85850	85830	85830	She	79	“ There ’s no baby , Enzo . Remember ? ”
85851	85862	85772	85772	I	0	“ Well , not yet . But there will be . ”
85869	85881	85863	85863	I	0	“ What ’s the target shooting schedule like for next week ? ”
85886	85892	85882	85882	She	79	“ I ’m not sure . ”
85893	85899	85830	85830	She	79	“ You ’re not sure ? ”
85906	85943	85944	85944	She	79	“ How is that possible ? Last month , you were like , ‘ We must bang on Wednesday evening at precisely ten - twenty - two p.m. Eastern Standard Time when the moon is full . ”
85949	85952	85944	85944	She	79	“ Sorry . ”
85961	85984	85954	85954	I	0	“ No , I ’m sorry . I should n’t make jokes . I was just wondering what day would be best . ”
85985	85998	85944	85944	She	79	“ Wednesday , I guess . If you still want to try . ”
85999	86002	86003	86003	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
86012	86022	86003	86003	I	0	“ Why would n’t I still want to try ? ”
86023	86043	85944	85944	She	79	“ I do n’t know . I ’ve just been thinking maybe you were getting tired of all this . ”
86044	86049	85944	85944	She	79	“ All this what ? ”
86050	86058	86059	86059	She	79	“ All this . . . me . ”

86088	86128	85944	85944	She	79	“ What the hell are you talking about ? This is exactly what I signed up for , Bianca . You asked me for three months and I said yes , right ? Along with some really ridiculous shit ? ”
86138	86150	86129	86129	I	0	“ Where is that contract ? Let ’s look at it . ”
86151	86154	85944	85944	She	79	“ Why ? ”
86155	86178	86129	86129	I	0	“ For fun . Come on , it will make you laugh . Remember how much fun we had making it up ? ”
86238	86245	86231	86231	She	79	“ Things were different back then . ”

86648	86668	86642	86642	She	79	“ Be honest with me , Bianca . Did you not take the pills because you changed your mind ? ”

86712	86733	86757	86757	She	79	“ Because it was n’t going to work anyway , and I figure we might as well just stop pretending . ”

87098	87114	87081	87081	I	0	“ Otherwise , I think it ’s best if I go back to my condo . ”

87168	87199	87133	87133	she	79	“ Because we can stay friends . I can still help you with the house . We can still talk . We just wo n’t be . . . together . ”
87374	87383	87384	87384	she	79	“ I ’ll call you tomorrow , okay ? ”

89914	89923	89902	89902	He	1704	“ What do you want on your pizza ? ”
89924	89929	89930	89930	I	0	“ Anything is fine . ”
89938	89946	89930	89930	I	0	“ Is Reina super young and hot ? ”
89947	89961	89962	89962	I	0	“ Yeah , but she ’s really into herself . It bugs me . ”
89969	89998	89962	89962	I	0	“ Well , give her a chance . Maybe she ’s insecure . Some people come off the wrong way at first because they ’re shy or nervous . ”
90006	90016	90001	90001	his	1704	“ I do n’t think that ’s her problem . ”
90087	90102	90103	90104	my brother	1704	“ So are you going to tell me what happened with Enzo or not ? ”
90144	90152	90188	90188	JJ	62	“ Did you guys have a fight ? ”
90153	90157	90188	90188	JJ	62	“ Not really . ”
90158	90165	90188	90188	JJ	62	“ So why are you here ? ”
90166	90183	90184	90184	I	0	“ I ’m here because Enzo and I realized that we might have rushed into marriage , ”
90192	90200	90188	90188	JJ	62	“ I could have told you that . ”
90201	90218	90188	90188	JJ	62	“ We ’re taking some time and space to figure out the best way to proceed . ”
90219	90227	90228	90228	I	0	“ Are you going to get divorced ? ”
90232	90238	90228	90228	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
90239	90245	90188	90188	JJ	62	“ Do you love him ? ”
90284	90291	90280	90280	my	0	“ That ’s a complicated question . ”
90292	90296	90228	90228	I	0	“ It is ? ”
90297	90300	90301	90301	I	0	“ Yes , ”
90317	90344	90301	90301	I	0	“ And even if I said yes , I do love him , it does n’t mean we should stay married . There are other factors . ”
90345	90349	90352	90352	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
90367	90377	90352	90352	I	0	“ Like whether or not he feels the same . ”
90378	90387	90301	90301	I	0	“ You think he does n’t love you ? ”
90388	90397	90398	90398	I	0	“ I know he does n’t love me . ”
90416	90424	90398	90398	I	0	“ Then why ’d he marry you ? ”
90425	90437	90438	90438	I	0	“ Look , this is why I said it was complicated . ”
90456	90491	90438	90438	I	0	“ I ca n’t explain why we ca n’t be married anymore , but I just know that we ca n’t . We tried , we failed . That ’s it , the end . ”
90492	90502	90506	90506	him	1292	“ Does n’t seem like you tried very hard . ”
90522	90530	90503	90503	I	0	“ Hey , where are you going ? ”
90531	90536	90506	90506	him	1292	“ To my office ! ”
90537	90544	90503	90503	I	0	“ Why ? We ’re talking . ”
90545	90551	90552	90552	I	0	“ I ’m done talking ! ”
90612	90615	90616	90616	she	115	“ Hey , ”
90625	90629	90616	90616	she	115	“ Hold on . ”
90645	90650	90651	90651	she	115	“ Where are you ? ”
90657	90663	90664	90664	I	0	“ I ’m at home , ”
90667	90679	90664	90664	I	0	“ As in my old condo . Why are you whispering ? ”
90680	90697	90633	90633	her	115	“ Because Griffin and Enzo are here and I do n’t want them to hear me . ”
90710	90719	90720	90720	she	115	“ Why are you at your old condo ? ”
90723	90753	90720	90720	she	115	“ Because Enzo and I are moving ahead with the plan at an accelerated pace . Phase two failed . We ’re now in phase three — the breakup . ”
90754	90760	90664	90664	I	0	“ You ’re breaking up ? ”
90761	90770	90664	90664	I	0	“ Actually , we were never really together . ”
90771	90797	90720	90720	she	115	“ You know what I mean . You ’re moving out ? You ’re getting divorced ? You ’re not trying for a baby anymore ? ”
90798	90804	90805	90805	I	0	“ All of the above , ”
90815	90872	90805	90805	I	0	“ I figured something had happened . I went by the Center Avenue house this afternoon with sandwiches and offered to stay and help out . Enzo was acting so weird , and you were nowhere to be found , and he kept saying he was n’t sure where you were or if you were coming . ”
90873	90882	90883	90883	I	0	“ What do you mean , acting weird ? ”
90886	90921	90883	90883	I	0	“ He was just not himself at all . Silent and broody . Big scowl on his face . Barking directions at everyone and snapping if anyone asked a question — especially about you . ”
90935	90942	90922	90922	I	0	“ So you ’re really leaving ? ”
90943	90950	90883	90883	I	0	“ I have to , Blair . ”
90951	90959	90960	90960	she	1296	“ Because of what you told me ? ”
90964	90967	90968	90968	I	0	“ Yes , ”
90978	91033	90968	90968	I	0	“ I could n’t stay another month . I could n’t keep sleeping with him . I could n’t bear another heartbreaking disappointment . I could n’t risk falling deeper in love with him . All of it was too much — I felt like I was under water . I could n’t breathe . ”
91034	91050	91051	91051	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Bianca . I wish there was something I could do . ”
91062	91090	91051	91051	I	0	“ I ’ll be okay . I ’m just going to stay away from him for a little while . Try to let my feelings cool off . ”
91091	91101	90968	90968	I	0	“ What about all your stuff at the house ? ”
91102	91111	91112	91112	I	0	“ I ’ll have to get it eventually . ”
91119	91128	91112	91112	I	0	“ What ’s he doing at your place ? ”
91129	91145	90968	90968	I	0	“ Griffin invited him over for dinner . He said he felt sorry for him . ”
91146	91154	90968	90968	I	0	“ How long will he be there ? ”
91155	91175	91112	91112	I	0	“ I do n’t know . We just ordered takeout . Why , do you want to come over ? ”
91176	91202	90968	90968	I	0	“ No ! I ’m wondering if I have time to go get some more stuff from the house . All my clothes are there . ”
91203	91219	90968	90968	I	0	“ Do you have to sneak around ? Ca n’t you just talk to him ? ”
91220	91232	91233	91233	I	0	“ I do n’t know if I can handle it yet , ”
91241	91272	91233	91233	I	0	“ Last night was so hard . I barely held it together . I do n’t want him to know how I feel — that will only make it worse . ”
91273	91276	90968	90968	I	0	“ Why ? ”
91277	91305	91233	91233	I	0	“ He ’ll just pity me . He ’ll look at me like he did after I got my period . Like he feels sorry for me . ”
91306	91316	91233	91233	I	0	“ Well , he does . I do too . ”
91317	91331	90968	90968	I	0	“ It ’s not how I want him to see me , okay ? ”
91362	91412	91356	91356	I	0	“ I want my pride back . I want my strength back . I want him to look at me and see the girl he thought I was . The one with courage and determination , who can handle anything life throws at her . The one with moxie . ”
91413	91416	91356	91356	I	0	“ Moxie ? ”
91417	91434	91435	91435	She	1298	“ Yes . He once said he liked that about me — that I had moxie . ”
91438	91455	91435	91435	She	1298	“ He likes a lot of things about you . He ’s just being an idiot . ”
91456	91471	91472	91472	I	0	“ No , he is n’t . He ’s being exactly who he is . ”
91480	91504	91472	91472	I	0	“ Exactly who I knew he was . And it ’s on me for falling for him when he told me not to . ”
91505	91510	91511	91511	Blair	115	“ I hate this , ”
91514	91523	91511	91511	Blair	115	“ Tell me what to do to help . ”
91524	91538	91472	91472	I	0	“ Can you figure out how long he ’ll be at your place ? ”
91539	91553	91472	91472	I	0	“ Am I supposed to do it without mentioning why I ’m asking ? ”
91554	91559	91560	91560	I	0	“ If you can . ”
91571	91582	91560	91560	I	0	“ I ’ll try . And I ’ll text you . ”
91583	91586	91472	91472	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
91675	91681	91682	91682	Griffin	76	“ What ’s going on ? ”
91693	91699	91700	91700	she	115	“ Nothing ’s going on , ”
91709	91723	91700	91700	she	115	“ I know that face . Something is going on . Who called ? ”
91724	91729	91730	91730	she	115	“ Called ? When ? ”
91768	91772	91773	91773	he	76	“ Just now , ”
91776	91785	91773	91773	he	76	“ Oh . Uh , that was Cheyenne . ”
91786	91798	91799	91799	Griffin	76	“ Cheyenne and Cole are at the movies with Mariah tonight , ”
91803	91815	91799	91799	Griffin	76	“ Oh , right . Ummm , it was your mom . ”
91816	91824	91773	91773	he	76	“ My mom is out of town . ”
91825	91828	91829	91829	Blair	115	“ Oh . ”
91833	91840	91829	91829	Blair	115	“ It was a wrong number ? ”
91841	91846	91847	91847	Griffin	76	“ A wrong number ? ”
91852	91870	91847	91847	Griffin	76	“ And you took your phone into the bedroom and talked to this stranger for five minutes ? ”
91871	91874	91875	91875	I	0	“ Blair , ”
91878	91883	91875	91875	I	0	“ Was it Bianca ? ”
91890	91902	91884	91884	She	115	“ Yes , but you ’re not supposed to know that . ”
91903	91906	91907	91907	Griffin	76	“ Why ? ”
91920	91951	91952	91952	She	115	“ Well , she wanted me to find out how long he ’d be here , because she wants to grab some clothes from the house without running into him . ”
91957	91964	91952	91952	She	115	“ I ’m sorry , Enzo . ”
91965	91974	91975	91975	Griffin	76	“ Wait a minute . Bianca moved out ? ”
91980	91983	91975	91975	Griffin	76	“ Yeah . ”
91992	91999	91984	91984	I	0	“ You guys got any whiskey ? ”
92021	92026	92027	92027	she	115	“ You want ice ? ”
92038	92041	92030	92030	she	115	“ Nah . ”
92042	92052	92053	92053	Blair	115	“ I told Bianca I ’d let her know , ”
92061	92069	92053	92053	Blair	115	“ You think maybe a couple hours ? ”
92092	92101	92075	92075	I	0	“ Why ca n’t she call me herself ? ”
92102	92108	92118	92118	her	115	“ I do n’t know . ”
92109	92115	92116	92116	She	115	“ What did she say ? ”
92127	92135	92116	92116	She	115	“ I ca n’t betray her confidence . ”
92161	92183	92151	92151	I	0	“ I do n’t understand her . Last night when she left , she said she wanted us to be friends . ”
92184	92192	92195	92195	her	115	“ I think she does want that . ”
92199	92221	92193	92193	Blair	115	“ She just needs a little time to get there . She ’s . . . she ’s sad , Enzo . ”
92222	92226	92227	92227	Blair	115	“ About what ? ”
92230	92233	92227	92227	Blair	115	“ Everything . ”
92234	92249	92250	92250	I	0	“ The whole thing was her idea , did she ever tell you that ? ”
92254	92257	92250	92250	I	0	“ Yes . ”
92290	92294	92279	92279	he	76	“ What happened ? ”
92295	92301	92302	92302	I	0	“ Fuck if I know . ”
92306	92321	92302	92302	I	0	“ One minute things were fine , the next she was packing a bag . ”
92322	92337	92339	92339	Blair	115	“ I ’m sure it was a really hard decision for her to make , ”
92344	92354	92341	92341	I	0	“ Did you guys have a fight or something ? ”
92370	92381	92358	92358	I	0	“ No . We have n’t fought in a while . ”
92382	92392	92393	92393	Blair	115	“ Trying to get pregnant can be really stressful , ”
92396	92401	92402	92402	I	0	“ I know that , ”
92411	92434	92406	92406	I	0	“ Sorry . I ’m just — in a bad mood . And tired . I did n’t sleep much last night . ”
92435	92439	92440	92440	Blair	115	“ I understand , ”
92454	92459	92460	92460	he	76	“ Want a glass ? ”
92464	92471	92462	92462	her	115	“ Yes . Thanks , honey . ”
92601	92604	92605	92605	I	0	“ Enzo ? ”
92617	92620	92610	92610	they	1308	“ What ? ”
92621	92636	92637	92637	I	0	“ Would it be okay to tell her she can go to the house ? ”
92640	92645	92637	92637	I	0	“ It ’s fine . ”
92646	92652	92610	92610	they	1308	“ Two hours is safe ? ”
92917	92920	92921	92921	I	0	“ Morning . ”
92984	92987	92988	92988	I	0	“ Morning , ”
93000	93006	92991	92991	She	115	“ That ’s for you . ”
93007	93010	93011	93011	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
93019	93024	93011	93011	I	0	“ I need it . ”
93025	93042	93043	93043	I	0	“ Griffin ran to the bakery for donuts . I have a rare Sunday morning off . ”
93052	93055	93056	93056	she	115	“ Easy , ”
93059	93064	93056	93056	she	115	“ It ’s hot . ”
93084	93091	93092	93092	She	115	“ I think someone poisoned me . ”
93095	93102	93092	93092	She	115	“ His name is Jack Daniels . ”
93103	93106	93125	93125	her	115	“ Bastard . ”
93107	93112	93092	93092	She	115	“ You ’ll live . ”
93156	93163	93164	93164	Blair	115	“ Did you go help her ? ”
93167	93188	93164	93164	Blair	115	“ Her brother was there too . We got everything out . She left the key on the kitchen counter . ”
93189	93192	93193	93193	I	0	“ Good , ”
93215	93221	93208	93208	She	115	“ How do you feel ? ”
93222	93225	93203	93203	She	115	“ Hungover . ”
93226	93233	93234	93234	I	0	“ I meant about Bianca leaving . ”
93245	93248	93234	93234	I	0	“ Fine . ”
93249	93252	93203	93203	She	115	“ Really ? ”
93253	93256	93257	93257	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
93269	93285	93257	93257	I	0	“ I feel fine about it . It was always the plan , after all . ”
93286	93304	93203	93203	She	115	“ I know , but . . . I do n’t think she ’s fine about it . ”
93305	93318	93203	93203	She	115	“ What do you mean ? She ’s the one who left . ”
93319	93329	93257	93257	I	0	“ That does n’t mean she really wanted to . ”
93341	93409	93410	93410	Blair	115	“ I ’m worn out , Blair . I ca n’t do this . I ca n’t read her mind . Unless she tells me what she ’s thinking or feeling , all I have to go on is what she says to me and what she does . And what she said Friday night was that she wanted to go . What she did was leave . ”
93420	93430	93414	93414	her	115	“ She told me you found the Clomid box . ”
93431	93434	93435	93435	I	0	“ Yes . ”
93443	93493	93435	93435	I	0	“ That ’s a perfect example . She decided on her own not to take them , decided we were n’t going to try a third time , knew she was going to leave early , and she said nothing to me about it . I was fucking blindsided . ”
93494	93501	93414	93414	her	115	“ She feels bad about that . ”
93502	93526	93414	93414	her	115	“ But she still left , Blair . What was I supposed to do , beg her to stay ? For what reason ? ”
93527	93533	93534	93534	she	115	“ I do n’t know , ”
93544	93555	93534	93534	she	115	“ Maybe because you guys have feelings for each other ? ”
93556	93566	93567	93567	I	0	“ We do n’t have feelings for each other , ”
93570	93608	93567	93567	I	0	“ We had a contract . We had rules . We had a start date and an end date . It was all fake . What do I care if she wants out sooner rather than later ? ”
93609	93618	93619	93619	she	115	“ It was all fake at the beginning , ”
93623	93630	93619	93619	she	115	“ But has n’t that changed ? ”
93639	93656	93631	93631	I	0	“ Part of me thought maybe it could change . But that was before she left . ”
93657	93677	93678	93678	Blair	115	“ So your ego is bruised — I get it . But if there ’s anything to be salvaged , ”
93697	93708	93678	93678	Blair	115	“ do n’t you think it ’s worth a conversation ? ”
93731	93737	93727	93727	I	0	“ I got ta go . ”
93738	93743	93744	93744	Blair	115	“ No , stay , ”
93747	93753	93744	93744	Blair	115	“ You should eat something . ”
93754	93760	93761	93761	I	0	“ I ’m not hungry , ”
93771	93776	93777	93777	he	76	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
93782	93797	93777	93777	he	76	“ Yeah . I ’ll call you later . Thanks for letting me crash . ”
94637	94648	94652	94652	her	261	“ Enzo Moretti , what is the matter with you ? ”
94684	94694	94695	94695	I	0	“ Ow , Ma ! I have a headache , ”
94703	94711	94712	94712	She	261	“ I ’ll just bet you do . ”
94739	94747	94736	94736	her	261	“ You were n’t at church today . ”
94748	94753	94736	94736	her	261	“ I slept in . ”
94758	94775	94736	94736	her	261	“ Where ? Not here , because I know what was going on here last night . ”
94798	94802	94791	94791	I	0	“ Answer me ! ”
94819	94827	94807	94807	I	0	“ Sorry . What was the question ? ”
94828	94835	94836	94836	she	261	“ Where were you last night ? ”
94860	94867	94848	94848	I	0	“ I was at Griffin ’s . ”
94868	94871	94874	94874	she	261	“ Really . ”
94880	94883	94874	94874	she	261	“ Really . ”
94884	94890	94891	94891	I	0	“ Not another woman ’s ? ”
94901	94906	94891	94891	I	0	“ What ? No ! ”
94907	94933	94874	94874	she	261	“ Because I can not imagine why your brand new wife was seen moving out of your house unless you betrayed her in some way . ”
94934	94941	94891	94891	I	0	“ Well , I did n’t . ”
94998	95004	95005	95006	my mother	261	“ So where is she ? ”
95009	95015	95005	95006	my mother	261	“ Probably at her condo . ”
95031	95034	95035	95035	I	0	“ Why ? ”
95038	95060	95035	95035	I	0	“ She said she ’d made a mistake . We rushed into the marriage . She just wants to be friends . ”
95072	95075	95077	95077	she	261	“ Bullshit ! ”
95086	95095	95077	95077	she	261	“ You did something to make her mad . ”
95096	95111	95077	95077	she	261	“ No , I did n’t , Ma . You can even ask her . ”
95112	95120	95121	95121	she	261	“ Believe me , I intend to , ”
95124	95146	95121	95121	she	261	“ But in the meantime , you march right over to wherever it is she went and you apologize to her . ”
95147	95157	95077	95077	she	261	“ For what ? I did n’t do anything . ”
95158	95164	95165	95165	I	0	“ Then apologize for that ! ”
95170	95189	95165	95165	I	0	“ This is ridiculous . She left , Mom . Why do n’t you feel sorry for me ? ”
95190	95196	95197	95197	Her	261	“ I just do n’t ! ”
95203	95210	95197	95197	Her	261	“ I know you too well . ”
95211	95217	95077	95077	she	261	“ What ’s that mean ? ”
95218	95249	95165	95165	I	0	“ It means , you do n’t take anything seriously . You think life is just one endless good time . A joke . Well , no one ’s laughing ! ”
95250	95259	95077	95077	she	261	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
95266	95284	95260	95260	I	0	“ You never took this marriage seriously . You would n’t even let the priest bless it . ”
95285	95297	95165	95165	I	0	“ Because it was just a piece of paper to us . ”
95304	95403	95300	95300	her	261	“ See what I mean ? Marriage is not just a piece of paper — it ’s a lifelong commitment . For better or worse , richer or poorer , ’ til death do you part . And with your history , Bianca probably suspected all along your heart was n’t really in it . You must have made her feel insecure . If it was n’t another woman , it had to be your job . You ’re just like your father ! You put work first ! You did n’t make her feel like a priority ! ”
95404	95415	95416	95416	I	0	“ You have no idea what you ’re talking about , ”
95422	95448	95416	95416	I	0	“ Then explain it to me . Why would a woman married less than two months leave the man she ’s madly in love with ? ”
95449	95460	95461	95461	I	0	“ She ’s not in love with me , Mom ! ”
95464	95470	95461	95461	I	0	“ Of course she is . ”
95477	95484	95474	95474	her	261	“ Any idiot could see it . ”
95485	95490	95491	95491	I	0	“ She ’s not , ”
95498	95506	95491	95491	I	0	“ She ’s just a good actress . ”
95516	95522	95510	95510	her	261	“ I do n’t understand . ”
95523	95547	95491	95491	I	0	“ We were never in love . We only got married so Dad would leave Moretti & Sons to me when he retired . ”
95554	95557	95548	95548	Her	244	“ No . ”
95558	95576	95510	95510	her	261	“ It ’s the truth . Bianca agreed to marry me because of that stupid family tradition . ”
95577	95588	95510	95510	her	261	“ But — but — why would she do that ? ”
95589	95595	95596	95596	I	0	“ That ’s between us , ”
95604	95623	95596	95596	I	0	“ But she ’s blameless . This was all my doing . I ’ll come clean to Dad . ”
95624	95650	95510	95510	her	261	“ Damn right , you will . I ’m not telling him this . It will kill him that he ’s raised a dishonest man . ”
95672	95712	95662	95662	I	0	“ Look , I ’m not proud of myself . I ’ll tell him . Just please do n’t say anything to anyone else . It would be humiliating for Bianca and me both . This is hard enough . ”
95713	95720	95721	95721	My	0	“ I do n’t get it . ”
95730	95750	95724	95724	her	261	“ You ’re in love . I know you are . I saw it . We all saw it . ”
95751	95768	95662	95662	I	0	“ You all saw what you wanted to see . What we wanted you to see . ”
95776	95785	95769	95770	My mother	261	“ Then why was she crying so hard ? ”
95786	95789	95724	95724	her	261	“ What ? ”
95790	95807	95769	95770	My mother	261	“ Last night when she was moving out , why was she crying the whole time ? ”
95820	95828	95769	95770	My mother	261	“ How do you know she was ? ”
95829	95851	95852	95852	I	0	“ Because people saw her . Edna Dodson lives right across the street and happened to be looking out her window . ”
95857	95861	95852	95852	I	0	“ Of course . ”
95862	95874	95769	95770	My mother	261	“ Then she went outside to water her flowers , and — ”
95875	95889	95769	95770	My mother	261	“ At nine o’clock at night , she had to water her flowers ? ”
95890	95893	95894	95895	my mother	261	“ Yes , ”
95898	95933	95894	95895	my mother	261	“ and thank goodness she did because she called me right away , very concerned . I told her she must have been mistaken , but I can see now that I was wrong . ”
95944	95960	95941	95941	I	0	“ What do you want from me , Mom ? I told you the truth . ”
95967	95975	95976	95976	she	261	“ I want you to fix this , ”
95986	96011	95976	95976	she	261	“ I told you , I ’m going to be honest with Dad . If he wants to leave Pietro the company , fine . ”
96020	96034	96012	96012	She	261	“ I do n’t mean with your father — I mean with Bianca . ”
96035	96048	96057	96057	my	0	“ There ’s nothing to fix with Bianca . It ’s over . ”
96049	96052	96053	96053	she	261	“ Bullshit ! ”
96060	96063	96064	96064	I	0	“ Ow , ”
96070	96084	96053	96053	she	261	“ Jeez , I forgot how violent you are when you ’re mad . ”
96085	96131	96132	96132	I	0	“ And I forgot how much you remind me of your father when you ’re being stubborn and ornery — you look me in the eye and tell me you do n’t love that girl , and may God strike you down if you lie ! ”
96156	96169	96170	96170	I	0	“ Look , it does n’t matter how I feel , Mom , ”
96173	96178	96170	96170	I	0	“ She ’s gone . ”
96179	96191	96230	96230	she	1358	“ You know what she needs to hear to come back . ”
96192	96199	96200	96200	I	0	“ No , I do n’t ! ”
96208	96226	96200	96200	I	0	“ Well , figure it out and say it before you lose her to someone who does ! ”
96948	96953	96954	96954	JJ	62	“ She ’s good , ”
96957	96968	96954	96954	JJ	62	“ Hey , can you hand me that oscillating tool ? ”
96989	97000	96980	96980	I	0	“ Has she , uh , mentioned me at all ? ”
97001	97007	97008	97008	He	62	“ Nope . Not really . ”
97030	97037	97019	97019	I	0	“ What ’s she been doing ? ”
97038	97052	96980	96980	I	0	“ She works a lot , and then she goes out at night . ”
97053	97057	97019	97019	I	0	“ She does ? ”
97072	97100	97060	97060	I	0	“ Huh . I did n’t think she went out much at night , especially work nights . Usually she just likes to read or watch TV . ”
97101	97113	96980	96980	I	0	“ Yeah , she ’s been out pretty much every night . ”
97114	97118	96980	96980	I	0	“ With who ? ”
97119	97142	97143	97143	I	0	“ Friends , I guess . I have n’t really gotten a chance to ask her because she gets home so late . ”
97146	97150	97143	97143	I	0	“ How late ? ”
97151	97160	97161	97161	My	0	“ I dunno . Two or three maybe . ”
97166	97171	97161	97161	My	0	“ In the morning ? ”
97172	97181	97143	97143	I	0	“ Yeah . Like after the bars close . ”
97322	97326	97318	97326	the one who was “ not okay . ”	2874	“ not okay . ”
97943	97949	97950	97950	Cheyenne	79	“ So how are you ? ”
97965	97970	97971	97971	I	0	“ I ’m okay , ”
97979	97985	97971	97971	I	0	“ I ’m doing okay . ”
97990	98002	97986	97986	Blair	115	“ Did you get your hair done ? It looks great . ”
98003	98011	98012	98012	I	0	“ Actually , I did it myself , ”
98020	98048	98012	98012	I	0	“ I wanted a change , and I was too impatient to wait for an opening with my stylist . I hope she does n’t kill me . ”
98049	98057	98058	98058	Cheyenne	79	“ I ’m sure she ’ll understand , ”
98061	98068	98058	98058	Cheyenne	79	“ We ’ve all been there . ”
98169	98178	98164	98164	Blair	115	“ So no word from Enzo , huh ? ”
98184	98187	98179	98179	I	0	“ Nope . ”
98188	98196	98197	98197	she	115	“ I have n’t seen him either , ”
98200	98210	98197	98197	she	115	“ Even Griffin said he ’s been strangely MIA . ”
98211	98214	98215	98215	Cheyenne	79	“ Same . ”
98222	98255	98215	98215	Cheyenne	79	“ I asked Cole before I left if he ’d heard from Enzo at all this week , and he said no . Evidently , he ’s not even responding to texts . ”
98277	98314	98215	98215	Cheyenne	79	“ He could be busy at work , now that he ’s in charge , or putting in a lot of time at the Center Avenue house . But he certainly has n’t been with me . ”
98315	98322	98323	98323	Blair	115	“ I do n’t get it ! ”
98327	98352	98323	98323	Blair	115	“ He was so miserable the day after you left , I thought for sure he ’d beg you to come back by now . ”
98353	98367	98368	98368	I	0	“ I think he was just mad about the way I did it , ”
98371	98387	98368	98368	I	0	“ without consulting him first . Or that I ’d been dishonest about the Clomid . ”
98388	98397	98398	98398	Blair	115	“ I think there was some of that , ”
98401	98437	98398	98398	Blair	115	“ He admitted he ’d felt blindsided , and his ego definitely took a hit . But he was hurt too , Bianca . I could tell . He did n’t want you to go . ”
98438	98449	98450	98450	Cheyenne	79	“ Then why did n’t he try to stop me ? ”
98457	98460	98461	98461	I	0	“ What ? ”
98464	98486	98488	98488	Cheyenne	79	“ It ’s just . . . These guys do n’t always know exactly how to express what they ’re feeling , ”
98490	98518	98488	98488	Cheyenne	79	“ They ’re either too stubborn or they seriously just ca n’t think of the right words or they ’re plain old scared to be that vulnerable . ”
98519	98535	98536	98536	I	0	“ The only thing Enzo is scared of is someone falling in love with him , ”
98539	98563	98536	98536	I	0	“ but then , of course , he goes and does everything he possibly can to make you fall in love with him . ”
98564	98569	98570	98570	Cheyenne	79	“ Not before you , ”
98578	98598	98575	98575	her	79	“ I ’ve known Enzo Moretti forever , and I ’ve never seen him act this way about anyone . ”
98624	98631	98632	98632	I	0	“ But it was n’t real , ”
98639	98645	98632	98632	I	0	“ It was n’t real . ”
98709	98714	98715	98715	he	1704	“ I ’m leaving , ”
98731	98738	98715	98715	he	1704	“ You seen my keys anywhere ? ”
98739	98745	98722	98722	he	1704	“ On the kitchen counter . ”
98746	98749	98750	98750	He	1704	“ Thanks . ”
98759	98775	98750	98750	He	1704	“ Hey , I forgot to tell you . I did you a favor today . ”
98776	98780	98722	98722	he	1704	“ What favor ? ”
98781	98791	98792	98792	I	0	“ Enzo was asking about you , and I — ”
98796	98804	98792	98792	I	0	“ What ? Where ? At work ? ”
98805	98845	98722	98722	he	1704	“ Yeah . He ’s paying a few guys cash under the table for side jobs at this new house he bought to flip . Anyway , he asked about you , and I said you were doing great . ”
98846	98849	98850	98850	I	0	“ Oh . ”
98867	98882	98722	98722	he	1704	“ Then he asked if you ever mentioned him , and I said no . ”
98883	98886	98722	98722	he	1704	“ Good . ”
98887	98904	98905	98905	I	0	“ Yeah , he looked kinda mad about that , so I kept going with it . ”
98917	98923	98905	98905	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
98924	98949	98950	98950	JJ	62	“ I mean I told him you seemed totally fine and you were going out every night until two or three in the morning . ”
98961	98964	98956	98956	I	0	“ What ? ”
98965	99004	98905	98905	I	0	“ Well , what was I supposed to tell him , that the minute you get home from work you put your pajamas on , eat ice cream for dinner , and cry the rest of the night ? ”
99005	99010	98950	98950	JJ	62	“ No , but — ”
99011	99032	99033	99033	I	0	“ Or that you spend so much time on the couch , the cushions are now shaped like your butt ? ”
99038	99044	99033	99033	I	0	“ It ’s my couch ! ”
99045	99064	98950	98950	JJ	62	“ Or that you told me you loved him but you left because he does n’t love you ? ”
99065	99068	99111	99111	Enzo	42	“ No ! ”
99069	99074	99075	99075	He	1704	“ All right then . ”
99078	99083	99075	99075	He	1704	“ You ’re welcome . ”
99239	99242	99243	99243	I	0	“ Hey , ”
99268	99271	99272	99272	he	1704	“ Hey , ”

99329	99334	99335	99335	he	1704	“ No , thanks , ”

99504	99521	99522	99522	he	1704	“ I know , but you really seemed to like them whenever we made homemade pasta , ”
99526	99535	99522	99522	he	1704	“ I thought you should have the set . ”
99536	99539	99483	99483	I	0	“ Oh . ”

100090	100096	100097	100097	He	1433	“ Because I have plans . ”
100117	100121	100097	100097	He	1433	“ Cancel them . ”

100441	100446	100395	100395	He	1433	“ To your bed ? ”
100447	100455	100422	100422	he	1433	“ Sure , we can start there . ”
100456	100462	100422	100422	he	1433	“ And end up where ? ”
100463	100481	100395	100395	He	1433	“ The kitchen table ? The shower ? The back of my car ? You name it . ”

100513	100533	100507	100507	He	1433	“ So tell me what you meant , because every time I try to guess , I guess wrong . ”
100534	100543	100544	100544	I	0	“ Just forget it . You should go . ”

100621	100626	100584	100584	Enzo	42	“ Confused about what ? ”
100627	100696	100586	100586	his	1433	“ When we first made the deal , I knew exactly what I was getting into and why . You wanted a wife , and I wanted a baby , but the two lines were n’t supposed to cross . We were each going to get what we wanted without making a mess of the other person ’s life . But it did n’t go down that way . ”
100697	100709	100584	100584	Enzo	42	“ Are you saying I made a mess of your life ? ”
100710	100717	100586	100586	his	1433	“ I ’m saying it happened . ”
100729	100754	100724	100724	I	0	“ I ’ll take all the blame . It ’s my fault . But jumping back into bed tonight would only make it worse . ”
100755	100758	100759	100759	I	0	“ How ? ”
100767	100855	100759	100759	I	0	“ Because I ’m not like you , Enzo ! I ca n’t separate sex and feelings as easily as you can . Yes , I miss you . Yes , I lie awake at night wishing you were next to me . Yes , I am aware that I will probably never have orgasms as good as the ones I had with you . But those orgasms are not a good enough reason to toss my heart on a cutting board and hand you a knife ! ”
100856	100865	100866	100866	he	1439	“ I never asked you to do that ! ”
100870	100904	100866	100866	he	1439	“ No , of course not . In fact , you told me flat out not to fall for you . You ’re into bodies , not hearts . I have n’t forgotten . ”
100905	100911	100912	100912	he	1439	“ And this is why ! ”
100922	100936	100912	100912	he	1439	“ This is what happens when people let their feelings fuck them up ! ”
100937	100941	100866	100866	he	1439	“ What feelings ? ”
100945	100962	100866	100866	he	1439	“ You do n’t have any feelings for me . You came here looking for sex ! ”
100963	100971	100972	100972	he	1439	“ I came here looking for you , ”
100981	100990	100972	100972	he	1439	“ But believe me , I regret it . ”
100991	101000	101001	101001	I	0	“ I ca n’t do this , Enzo . ”
101011	101019	101001	101001	I	0	“ Fuck , forget I said that . ”
101028	101035	101020	101020	He	1439	“ I did n’t mean it . ”
101036	101048	101049	101049	I	0	“ Let ’s just end this here and now , okay ? ”
101052	101101	101049	101049	I	0	“ Before we both say things just to hurt each other , things that we do n’t really mean ? We ’ve known from the start that we were never meant to be . It was just a piece of paper , remember ? Just a business deal . ”
101107	101110	101104	101104	his	1439	“ Yeah . ”
101111	101124	101020	101020	He	1439	“ I’m — I’m sorry I lied to you about the pills . ”

101134	101160	101104	101104	his	1439	“ And I ’m sorry I left so suddenly . I did n’t do it to hurt you — I did it to save myself . ”
101161	101165	101166	101166	he	1439	“ From what ? ”
101173	101189	101166	101166	he	1439	“ I do n’t get why all of a sudden you ’re afraid of me . ”
101232	101273	101274	101274	He	1439	“ From falling deeper in love with you than I already am . From getting so attached to you that I ’d never be able to walk away . From the crushing heartbreak of having to endure you leaving me . ”
101287	101305	101282	101282	I	0	“ Because you would have left , Enzo . Sooner or later , you would have left . ”
101317	101327	101306	101306	I	0	“ I ca n’t give you what you want . ”
101351	101383	101341	101341	I	0	“ And before I lose all self - respect and do something stupid like sleep with you anyway because I even miss the damn smolder , I need you to go . ”

103177	103192	103193	103193	She	115	“ Can I come in ? I really need to talk to you guys . ”
103201	103204	103205	103205	I	0	“ Okay . ”

103300	103317	103279	103279	I	0	“ I can tell . You look like you have n’t eaten or slept in days . ”

103410	103415	103407	103407	he	76	“ What ’s up ? ”
103424	103442	103443	103443	Griffin	76	“ He came for advice , but I need to feed him too . He looks awful . ”
103448	103454	103443	103443	Griffin	76	“ What ’s going on ? ”
103460	103467	103443	103443	Griffin	76	“ I fucked up with Bianca . ”
103468	103471	103472	103472	He	76	“ Again ? ”
103486	103496	103472	103472	He	76	“ I thought she broke things off last weekend . ”
103497	103535	103443	103443	Griffin	76	“ She did . But I went over there last night to give her some things she ’d left at my house , and maybe try to talk to her , and it did n’t go well . ”
103536	103548	103472	103472	He	76	“ That ’s because you tried to do more than talk , ”
103566	103571	103561	103561	Griffin	76	“ Is that true ? ”
103572	103585	103586	103586	Blair	115	“ Uh , yeah . My approach might have been a problem . ”
103595	103599	103586	103586	Blair	115	“ You think ? ”
103600	103609	103610	103610	I	0	“ Well , I could n’t help myself , ”
103614	103652	103610	103610	I	0	“ I miss her , and I was all worked up because her brother had told me some bullshit about her going out every night , and I was picturing her talking to guys and getting jealous . ”
103664	103673	103674	103674	Griffin	76	“ Me ! Getting jealous of other guys ! ”
103677	103685	103674	103674	Griffin	76	“ What is the world coming to ? ”
103686	103713	103610	103610	I	0	“ Fuck off . I ’m not used to this , okay ? I do n’t like missing her . I do n’t like this feeling . ”
103714	103720	103721	103721	he	76	“ What ’s the feeling ? ”
103730	103779	103780	103780	Griffin	76	“ I do n’t even know what to call it , but it ’s horrible . It feels like the worst flu I ’ve ever had . My chest hurts , my stomach is churning all the time , and my head is all foggy and fucked up . ”
103783	103791	103780	103780	Griffin	76	“ You ’re in love with her . ”
103792	103796	103798	103798	Blair	115	“ For sure , ”
103818	103841	103809	103809	I	0	“ I saw her in church this morning , and I could n’t even breathe . What am I going to do ? ”
103842	103847	103849	103849	Griffin	76	“ Get her back , ”
103851	103867	103849	103849	Griffin	76	“ She does n’t want me , Griff . She kicked me out last night . ”
103868	103875	103876	103876	Blair	115	“ Because you did it wrong , ”
103894	103922	103876	103876	Blair	115	“ You strutted in there like a peacock and expected her to just fall into bed with you . You did n’t tell her how you felt . ”
103923	103929	103930	103930	I	0	“ Yes , I did , ”
103940	103948	103949	103949	I	0	“ Okay , I sort of did , ”
103969	103975	103976	103976	Griffin	76	“ What did you say ? ”
103979	104011	103976	103976	Griffin	76	“ I told her I missed her — I said lots of nice things about missing her — but then she started in with all these questions , and I panicked . ”
104017	104023	104012	104012	Griffin	76	“ What kind of questions ? ”
104024	104030	104031	104031	I	0	“ Like about the future , ”
104040	104130	104031	104031	I	0	“ She asked where we ’d end up , and I did n’t know . I felt like she was expecting me to predict exactly what will happen . It ’s impossible , is n’t it ? How can you promise someone something like forever — until fucking death do you part — and not feel like you ’re just gambling on it ? To me , it seems like building a house without a blueprint . Hmm , let ’s just start laying bricks and see what happens . ”
104136	104160	104131	104131	I	0	“ It ’s madness . And yet . . . I ca n’t see forever without her . I do n’t want to . ”
104161	104169	104170	104170	Blair	115	“ You ’re not wrong , Enzo , ”
104183	104207	104208	104208	I	0	“ It is a kind of madness . And it is a gamble . You have to be willing to take a risk . ”
104211	104248	104208	104208	I	0	“ Even if I am willing , how do I convince her to give me another chance ? She keeps pushing me away . Even after she said she loved me , she pushed me away . ”
104249	104257	104258	104258	Blair	115	“ Okay , but think about that , ”
104265	104309	104258	104258	Blair	115	“ Let ’s say she ’s being honest about her feelings — because I think she is . She does love you . She did n’t want to , but she does . So why do you think she would push you away ? ”
104318	104325	104310	104310	I	0	“ I have no fucking idea . ”
104326	104332	104333	104333	I	0	“ I bet you do . ”
104339	104369	104333	104333	I	0	“ You sound just like my mother . If I had all these answers , I would n’t be so miserable trying to read her mind — or yours ! ”
104384	104433	104370	104370	Blair	115	“ Look , I ’m trying to navigate this without betraying my friend . I ’m sorry it ’s frustrating for you . But I really think you can piece together why Bianca believes breaking it off with you now will save her a lot of heartache later . ”
104444	104452	104370	104370	Blair	115	“ She did say this one thing . ”
104453	104458	104459	104459	Griffin	76	“ What was it ? ”
104462	104476	104479	104479	his	76	“ She said that she had to leave me before I left her . ”

104515	104538	104507	104507	I	0	“ She does n’t think she can get pregnant , and maybe she ’s afraid I ’d leave her because of it . ”
104539	104542	104543	104543	Blair	115	“ Bingo . ”
104548	104593	104543	104543	Blair	115	“ And Enzo , as much as I want you two to end up together , I think you have to ask yourself that question . If you want your own biological kids and Bianca ca n’t get pregnant , that ’s an issue . ”
104680	104686	104687	104687	I	0	“ I do want kids , ”

104734	104743	104744	104744	She	115	“ But what if she rejects me again ? ”
104747	104759	104744	104744	She	115	“ Do it right this time , and she wo n’t . ”
104763	104776	104777	104777	She	115	“ The good thing is , you ’re already married to her . ”

104836	104852	104853	104853	Blair	115	“ Then do it all again , and give her what she deserves this time , ”
104856	104880	104853	104853	Blair	115	“ Change all the things you messed up . Say all the things you should have said . Make it real this time . ”
104887	104896	104881	104881	I	0	“ That ’s actually a really great idea . ”
104902	104906	104897	104897	She	115	“ Thank you . ”
104926	104946	104909	104909	her	115	“ But if you hurt her again , Enzo Moretti , I will hunt you down and destroy you . ”
104947	104956	104957	104957	I	0	“ I ’m not going to hurt her , ”
104965	104986	104957	104957	I	0	“ I ’m just going to get her back . But I might need help . Yours and Cheyenne ’s . ”
104987	104996	105003	105003	she	115	“ Whatever you need , we ’re there . ”
105017	105031	105003	105003	she	115	“ But mostly , we just want to tell her we were right . ”
105071	105081	105063	105063	she	261	“ Well ? Did you do what I said ? ”
105082	105086	105087	105087	She	261	“ Not yet . ”
105090	105115	105087	105087	She	261	“ I need to talk to Dad , okay ? I ca n’t do anything until I clear my conscience about lying to him . ”
105126	105164	105121	105121	she	261	“ He ’s in his office . I do n’t know why he calls it retirement since he still gets up early , takes his coffee into his office , and stays at his desk for hours . ”
105192	105195	105183	105183	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
105211	105221	105235	105235	he	1535	“ It ’s me . Can I come in ? ”
105250	105253	105235	105235	he	1535	“ Sure . ”
105273	105279	105254	105254	I	0	“ How are you feeling ? ”
105280	105283	105284	105284	He	1535	“ Good . ”
105308	105317	105300	105300	I	0	“ So I need to tell you something . ”
105318	105321	105254	105254	I	0	“ Okay . ”
105322	105327	105300	105300	I	0	“ I fucked up . ”
105339	105372	105300	105300	I	0	“ I did something I ’m not proud of , and I need to come clean about it to you before I can fix things with Bianca — this involves her too . ”
105373	105378	105254	105254	I	0	“ I ’m listening . ”
105379	105394	105395	105395	I	0	“ I only married her so you would n’t give the company to Pietro . ”
105402	105414	105395	105395	I	0	“ I know it was wrong , and I ’m sorry . ”
105430	105458	105419	105419	I	0	“ It was dishonest and shady , and that ’s not the kind of man I am . It ’s not the kind of man you raised . ”
105459	105466	105395	105395	I	0	“ No , it is n’t . ”
105467	105492	105493	105493	He	1541	“ If you want to turn Moretti & Sons over to Pietro , I ’ll understand . And I ’ll help him run it . ”
105504	105516	105493	105493	He	1541	“ I was never going to give the company to Pietro . ”
105517	105520	105395	105395	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
105521	105541	105395	105395	I	0	“ Your brother is good at a lot of things . Being CEO would not be one of them . ”
105542	105573	105574	105574	I	0	“ So . . . so I did n’t need to get married and start a family in order to prove that I was responsible enough to run the company ? ”
105577	105621	105574	105574	I	0	“ No . You needed to get married and start a family because that ’s what you want out of life . And you were never going to do it if you did n’t sense some kind of pressure to get it done . ”
105625	105659	105622	105622	He	1541	“ That ’s the way it always is with Moretti men . We like our independence too much . We ’re selfish and stubborn . We need a shove in the right direction . ”
105665	105674	105660	105660	I	0	“ So I did all this for nothing ? ”
105679	105738	105675	105676	My father	204	“ Are you listening to me ? You did it because deep down , you wanted to . You were tired of being alone . You were ready for a family . But like all Moretti men , you needed a push , so I gave it to you — just like my father gave it to me . ”
105810	105816	105817	105817	I	0	“ Maybe you ’re right , ”
105821	105828	105817	105817	I	0	“ Of course I ’m right . ”
105835	105865	105830	105830	he	204	“ You think I did n’t see what you were doing ? I raised you . I taught you everything you know . And I was n’t born yesterday . ”
105866	105881	105882	105882	He	204	“ You knew I was n’t in love with Bianca when I married her ? ”
105887	105895	105884	105884	his	204	“ Why did n’t you say anything ? ”
105896	105903	105830	105830	he	204	“ Because I had a feeling . ”
105904	105908	105884	105884	his	204	“ What feeling ? ”
105916	105967	105884	105884	his	204	“ That she was the one for you . I saw it that night at the table when you announced your engagement . I was n’t sure what kind of game you two were playing , but I saw pretty clearly how it would end as long as nobody interfered . ”
105975	105986	105968	105968	I	0	“ She is the one . I see it now . ”
105987	106004	106020	106020	he	204	“ Better late than never , I guess . Now go make sure she knows it . ”
106024	106066	106020	106020	he	204	“ You have to say the words , son . And you have to mean what you say . Bianca ’s the kind of girl who will see right through your bullshit — that ’s why she ’s perfect for you . ”
106073	106077	106067	106067	His	204	“ I know . ”
106078	106120	106121	106121	I	0	“ Good . Now get the fuck out of here , and do n’t come back until you ’ve made things right with your wife — and get used to doing it , by the way . That ’s married life . ”
106124	106132	106121	106121	I	0	“ Thanks , Pop . For everything . ”
106976	106981	106982	106982	Blair	115	“ You look great , ”
106991	106998	106982	106982	Blair	115	“ Is that a new dress ? ”
107015	107033	106999	106999	I	0	“ Yeah . I felt like I needed to get out of my all - black rut . ”
107037	107063	107034	107034	Blair	115	“ It was a long winter , was n’t it ? But this summer will be great . We have lots to look forward to . ”
107082	107093	107070	107070	Blair	115	“ Shoot . I do n’t see any parking spaces . ”
107094	107101	107102	107102	I	0	“ There ’s one over there , ”
107110	107135	107102	107102	I	0	“ But you ’re wearing heels , and that ’s a long walk . Why do n’t you jump out and grab our table ? ”
107136	107150	107151	107151	I	0	“ Blair , do n’t be silly . They ’re not that high . ”
107166	107173	107151	107151	I	0	“ I ’ll walk with you . ”
107174	107177	107178	107178	she	115	“ No ! ”
107187	107193	107183	107183	she	115	“ I mean , no . ”
107199	107222	107223	107223	I	0	“ You go in . We ’re a little late already , and I bet Cheyenne is in there waiting for us . ”
107226	107235	107223	107223	I	0	“ Okay . I ’ll see you inside . ”
107243	107252	107239	107239	she	115	“ Yes , good . See you inside . ”
107370	107382	107365	107365	Victoria	163	“ Hi , Mrs. Moretti . Your table is all set . ”
107393	107403	107365	107365	Victoria	163	“ Uh , thanks . Is my friend here ? ”
107404	107407	107408	107408	she	163	“ Yes , ”
107414	107419	107408	107408	she	163	“ Right this way . ”
107596	107599	107588	107588	His	1590	“ Hi . ”
107600	107605	107606	107606	I	0	“ What is this ? ”
107646	107651	107640	107640	he	1590	“ Thanks , Victoria . ”
107652	107660	107661	107661	She	1580	“ You ’re welcome , Mr. Moretti . ”
107688	107694	107676	107676	Enzo	42	“ Will you sit down ? ”
107716	107731	107702	107702	myself	0	“ I do n’t know . What ’s going on ? Where is Cheyenne ? ”
107738	107744	107732	107732	Enzo	42	“ They ’re not here . ”
107745	107750	107702	107702	myself	0	“ They ’re not ? ”
107751	107783	107818	107818	Enzo	42	“ No , I just needed their help getting you here . I did n’t think you ’d come if I asked you myself , and I wanted to surprise you . ”
107784	107794	107795	107795	I	0	“ Well , it worked . I ’m surprised . ”
107806	107817	107818	107818	Enzo	42	“ But I ’m also upset . I feel tricked . ”
107826	107861	107862	107862	He	1594	“ Don’t — it ’s not like that , I promise . Just please sit . Give me five minutes , and if you still want to leave , I wo n’t fight you . ”
107909	107917	107918	107918	I	0	“ I do n’t owe you anything , ”
107936	107943	107944	107944	He	1594	“ No , you do n’t . ”
107957	107975	107944	107944	He	1594	“ But I owe you something . Please give me another chance to give it to you . ”
108023	108027	108028	108028	he	1594	“ Thank you , ”
108049	108055	108040	108040	He	1594	“ That ’s for you . ”
108056	108061	108062	108062	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
108074	108085	108086	108086	He	1594	“ What is it that you think you owe me ? ”
108192	108197	108244	108244	He	1594	“ What is that ? ”
108198	108243	108244	108244	He	1594	“ That is a very close — as close as I could get inside a week — approximation of the ring your great - grandfather the bootlegger gave to your great - grandmother . . . with a slightly bigger diamond , of course . ”
108252	108259	108244	108244	He	1594	“ Oh my God . Enzo . ”
108269	108280	108281	108281	he	1594	“ What I owe you is the truth , Bianca , ”
108290	108404	108281	108281	he	1594	“ All my life , I did n’t think it would matter who I married . I wanted kids for the sake of carrying on tradition and the experience of fatherhood , but it was n’t until I fell in love with you that I understood what that really means . I do n’t just want to have children so I can be a dad — I want to have children with you . I want to raise a family with you . And when it ’s just us again in that big old Center Avenue house , I want to sit on the porch in a rocking chair and argue with you . ”
108442	108447	108448	108448	he	1595	“ I love you , ”
108463	108497	108448	108448	he	1595	“ More than I ’ve ever loved anything or anyone . I ’m sorry I made you wait to hear it . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . ”

108552	108558	108547	108547	he	1595	“ Do you mean it ? ”
108559	108562	108563	108563	He	1595	“ Yes . ”
108571	108630	108563	108563	He	1595	“ You ’re the most beautiful , the most caring , and the most exasperating woman I ’ve ever known . You can infuriate me like no one else — but you make me happier than anyone else ever could . And the love I feel for you is the truest , realest thing I ’ve ever known . ”
108644	108650	108563	108563	He	1595	“ I love you too . ”
108651	108689	108690	108690	I	0	“ I want a love story like your great - grandparents — one that will outlast our time on earth , one that our great - grandkids will still be talking about a hundred years from now . ”
108700	108706	108690	108690	I	0	“ I want that too . ”
108707	108713	108756	108756	I	0	“ Will you marry me ? ”

108730	108751	108690	108690	I	0	“ But you deserved a better proposal . So what do you say ? Still want to be my wife ? ”
108752	108755	108756	108756	I	0	“ Yes , ”
108774	108777	108762	108762	I	0	“ Yes . ”

108847	108860	108861	108861	I	0	“ Why ? Did you think I was going to say no ? ”
108876	108879	108880	108880	He	1596	“ Honestly ? ”
108883	108904	108880	108880	He	1596	“ No . I figured you ’d say yes . But I ’d have deserved it if you said no . ”
108916	108926	108905	108905	I	0	“ Oh , good . You ’re still you . ”
108927	108933	108934	108934	His	1596	“ I ’m still me . ”
108969	108978	108950	108950	Cheyenne	79	“ We heard cheering ! Did it happen ? ”

109493	109502	109503	109503	he	1604	“ But it ’ll be dark by then , ”
109506	109512	109503	109503	he	1604	“ I wo n’t care , ”
109516	109524	109503	109503	he	1604	“ I want to see it tonight . ”

I ’ve looked at them a thousand times and never thought twice about them . But now when I see them , they remind me of the importance of family , of putting down roots , and of having faith in something bigger than ourselves . And that ’s because of you . ”

110229	110270	110225	110225	he	1610	“ I did n’t want to do it before — neither of us did — because it would have felt wrong . And it would have been because our parents pressured us into it . This is just between us . ”
110271	110275	110276	110277	Father Mike	69	“ And God , ”
110280	110285	110287	110287	Enzo	42	“ Oh , right , ”

110441	110456	110434	110434	Enzo	42	“ There ’s a lot more work to do to get this place livable . ”

110566	110578	110579	110579	he	1610	“ We ’re going to be happy here , Mrs. Moretti , ”
110588	110625	110579	110579	he	1610	“ We ’re going to fill this house with a bunch of noisy , messy kids who are going to drive us crazy , but we ’re going to be happy . I can feel it . ”
110634	110640	110626	110626	I	0	“ I feel it too . ”

110812	110832	110833	110833	He	1610	“ Plus my ring says a hundred years . So I figure I should at least honor that promise . ”
110844	110868	110833	110833	He	1610	“ You better . I do n’t want to be without you . I do n’t even feel like me without you anymore . ”

110914	110949	110869	110869	I	0	“ Damn right . After all , I need to pass that on to future generations of Morettis . Even if I do n’t pass it through DNA , it can still be taught . ”
