5836	5840	5841	5841	I	0	“ So actually , ”
5844	5880	5841	5841	I	0	“ these pictures are relevant . Because we ’re not selling hemostatic gel . We ’re selling another day . We ’re selling possibilities . And giving medical personnel the power to deliver on that . ”

6159	6167	6143	6143	They	423	“ We could have them talk about — ”
6168	6180	6181	6182	Mr. Drummond	101	“ How about achieving our goals without a lot of fluff ? ”
6251	6262	6263	6263	He	101	“ Social media , too ? No images of people ? ”
6269	6285	6263	6263	He	101	“ Okay , so the assignment is to modernize and humanize Vossameer ’s online presence , ”
6293	6310	6286	6286	I	0	“ and I hear you saying , let ’s do that without using any humans whatsoever . ”

6452	6458	6459	6459	she	100	“ You were a disaster , ”
6462	6483	6459	6459	she	100	“ The way you contradicted him on everything . I had to pull it out of the fire for you . ”
6502	6505	6506	6506	I	0	“ Well , ”

6535	6540	6541	6541	I	0	“ Consider them pulled , ”
6544	6564	6541	6541	I	0	“ And your outfit . It was highly distracting to Mr. Drummond . The employee handbook forbids revealing outfits . ”
6594	6602	6603	6603	she	100	“ It ’s distractingly formfitting as well , ”
6606	6617	6603	6603	she	100	“ This is a workplace , not a fashion show . ”
6700	6707	6708	6708	I	0	“ I ’ll keep it appropriate , ”
6764	6782	6783	6783	she	100	“ Even so , I ’m going to have to write you up for inappropriate workplace attire , ”
6786	6789	6783	6783	she	100	“ What ? ”

6897	6912	6894	6894	she	100	“ This is what she wants . She wants for you to become invisible . ”
6928	6946	6947	6947	I	0	“ This is a code red alarm . We need serious ugly firepower to hide your hotness . ”
6972	6994	6963	6963	she	112	“ I ’m going for invisible , not , ‘ Look at me ! I ’m having a psychotic break ! ’ ”

7233	7241	7242	7242	She	112	“ Fine . Do n’t wear them . ”
7261	7275	7242	7242	She	112	“ You look like you ’re in a religious survivalist sect or something . ”
7276	7279	7280	7280	She	112	“ Yay ? ”
7287	7297	7298	7298	she	112	“ There ’s still your face to contend with , ”
7301	7309	7282	7282	her	112	“ Your face is still a problem . ”
7310	7321	7242	7242	She	112	“ I already do n’t like where this is going . ”

7364	7402	7403	7403	I	0	“ No , no , a different snack . Cookies remind you of the bakery and the bakery makes you sad . You like every kind of candy . How about gummy bears ? You love those . ”
7418	7441	7406	7406	I	0	“ I want you to picture gummy bears . Show on your face how you feel about gummy bears . Right now . ”
7449	7466	7442	7442	I	0	“ Okay , pull it back a little . You do n’t love them that much . ”
7472	7483	7484	7484	she	444	“ There ! Now I want you to add something , ”
7487	7517	7484	7484	she	444	“ Think of gummy bears while looking at my nose . Never my eyes , just my nose . It ’ll make you seem distant and a little stupid . ”
7518	7543	7544	7544	Mia	112	“ Wow , Mia , if you decide to quit your day gig , you could try for a career as a makeover expert . ”
7584	7594	7595	7595	She	444	“ It ’s totally effective . Check it out . ”
7607	7620	7595	7595	She	444	“ Do n’t I seem dull now ? Who even does this ? ”
7621	7634	7635	7635	I	0	“ Oh my god ! It ’s like you ’re barely there ! ”
7661	7701	7656	7656	Mia	112	“ You must avoid looking into his eyes at all times , just in case your pupils grow large and Sasha picks up on it as a sign of sexual attraction . Or worse , if Mr. Drummond does . ”

7719	7727	7716	7716	I	0	“ You did say he was gorgeous . ”
7728	7765	7656	7656	Mia	112	“ That does n’t mean I ’m sexually attracted to him . I think the Taj Mahal is gorgeous , but I ’m not going to stand in front of a picture of it and masturbate . ”
7766	7776	7656	7656	Mia	112	“ Okay , now , that ’s just disturbing . ”
7777	7786	7787	7787	I	0	“ I ’m seriously not attracted to him , ”
7804	7853	7787	7787	I	0	“ I ’m off guys , and if for some bizarre reason I wanted a new relationship , it would not be with somebody who ’s more of a controlling asshole than Mason ever was . And what a jerk ! Keep your eyes to yourself , jackass ! ”
7923	7973	7920	7920	themselves	456	“ From now on , if you ever have contact with Mr. Drummond , you must do the opposite of what you did before . For example , you guys had that conflict about photos and you told him why he was wrong , right ? You challenged him . ”
7974	7984	7985	7985	I	0	“ Yeah , but I was nice about it , ”
7988	7992	7985	7985	I	0	“ Unlike him . ”
7993	8047	8048	8048	I	0	“ Still , you challenged him , and a guy like that is n’t used to being challenged , so it made you stand out , because clearly everyone there kisses his ass . So if you interact with him again , you have to act impressed . Like he ’s so amazing . ”
8051	8055	8048	8048	I	0	“ Hold up . ”
8072	8081	8082	8082	she	112	“ I know it ’s hard for you , ”

8130	8140	8141	8141	I	0	“ Kylie Jenner . No , no , no . ”
8152	8191	8141	8141	I	0	“ I do n’t know if I have it in me to kiss Mr. Drummond ’s ass . It ’s a lot harder than wearing an ugly dress . I do n’t know if I can do it . ”
8192	8221	8141	8141	I	0	“ I know , but just remind yourself he ’s not Mason . He ’s controlling and jerky like Mason , but he is not Mason , okay ? ”
8222	8225	8306	8306	her	458	“ Okay . ”
8226	8265	8141	8141	I	0	“ You will act impressed and amazed whenever he comes around . You just have to last tomorrow , you get the weekend to rest , and then it ’s one more week . You can do it . ”
8266	8275	8141	8141	I	0	“ I do n’t know if I can . ”
8276	8280	8281	8281	She	458	“ You can . ”
8296	8303	8281	8281	She	458	“ We ’re in this together . ”
8309	8319	8304	8304	I	0	“ It hugely helps that you would say that . ”
8320	8351	8352	8352	I	0	“ I ’m always with you . Even when you move back to Fargo . I ’ll be the devil on your shoulder telling you to have that extra dessert . ”
8355	8364	8365	8365	she	458	“ But I think you wo n’t move , ”
8368	8394	8365	8365	she	458	“ I think you ’ll find a gorgeous , dirt - cheap space to rent for your new bakery that you ca n’t pass up . ”
8401	8422	8395	8395	I	0	“ A gorgeous , dirt - cheap place that they are dying to rent to me with my shitty credit . ”
8423	8432	8447	8447	She	458	“ There are still lucky finds out there . ”
8433	8439	8440	8440	I	0	“ Not in this city , ”

8544	8571	8541	8541	I	0	“ I ’m going to find somebody with a boyfriend or girlfriend who has their own place . And eighteen months later , boo - yah . ”
8572	8583	8584	8584	she	468	“ Friends do n’t let friends say boo - yah , ”
8594	8605	8606	8606	she	468	“ I wonder what Mr. Drummond ’s like in bed , ”
8609	8622	8606	8606	she	468	“ Is he just as much of a control freak in bed ? ”
8623	8662	8587	8587	I	0	“ Oh my god ! Is this a good question to be asking me ? Is this what I want in my mind as I struggle to gaze at his nose while channeling my love of gummy bears ? ”
8663	8672	8711	8711	she	468	“ You know you ’ve been wondering it . ”
8673	8688	8689	8689	I	0	“ He ’s probably a deadbeat . His most effusive praise is a grunt , ”
8692	8699	8689	8689	I	0	“ What does that tell you ? ”
8714	8721	8711	8711	she	468	“ It tells me , caveman . ”
8722	8739	8740	8740	I	0	“ Fuck the fuck off ! Seriously ? That ’s what you put in my head ? ”

12866	12915	12860	12860	I	0	“ It depends . I ’m thinking we could work up a creative brief and strategy , but if you want the proposal to contain a budget , that might add time . We ’d need a set of measurable goals and a timeframe to get the budget . ”

13140	13209	13210	13210	She	593	“ This is not to be used for any other purpose . Have a wake - up call placed to me at 4:30 in the morning , every weekday morning , starting Monday . If I do n’t answer , it ’s to repeat . If I answer and hang up , it ’s to repeat . They need to make sure I ’m awake . You understand ? ”

13232	13255	13219	13220	Lizzie Sasha	100	“ Do you realize you did n’t make eye contact with Mr. Drummond once today ? Do you think that ’s polite ? ”
13256	13260	13219	13220	Lizzie Sasha	100	“ Excuse me ? ”
13261	13274	13275	13275	she	593	“ He was wondering why you would n’t even look at him , ”
13278	13289	13275	13275	she	593	“ What was that ? Some kind of elusiveness game ? ”
13311	13321	13305	13306	the man	595	“ I was trying to be non - distracting . ”
13322	13361	13362	13362	I	0	“ You think that was non - distracting ? To so pointedly ignore him when he was speaking to you ? This is a workplace , not a forum for testing out strategies best left to singles bars . ”
13544	13579	13580	13580	I	0	“ I want you to attempt to write up a credible Instagram strategy . Let ’s see what you ’ve got . Propose a reasonable set of goals and a strategy to get there . ”
13604	13648	13580	13580	I	0	“ Can we use stories of real - life people who were helped by the products ? With the details changed , of course . But instead of people pictures , we could have images like a bicycle if they were a biker … ”
13655	13679	13580	13580	I	0	“ And run afoul of medical - records privacy laws ? Does that sound like the kind of marketing Mr. Drummond would appreciate ? ”
13680	13684	13685	13685	I	0	“ Guess not , ”
13689	13697	13698	13698	I	0	“ Wait , I have an idea , ”
13701	13800	13698	13698	I	0	“ We do two directions — one that ’s on the passion of employees here , and maybe even a work - journal blog - type thing on a breakthrough . Even better — you know how Mr. Drummond ’s working on that new thing ? We could send a junior chemist up to take notes on his progress , and get shots of beakers and things , and it would be like an exciting race to find a cure . I bet Mr. Drummond would love that — he ’s so focused on his formulas , right ? ”
13801	13804	13805	13805	Sasha	100	“ Hmm . ”
13810	13830	13805	13805	Sasha	100	“ And then a third direction — a rationale on why Instagram is a waste of money for Vossameer . ”
13831	13837	13698	13698	I	0	“ He asked for Instagram . ”
13838	13872	13873	13873	She	100	“ I think he ’d appreciate it if we evaluated it critically instead of just saying yes . ‘ Why Instagram is wrong for Vossameer . ’ I bet he ’d love it . ”
13902	13928	13899	13899	Sasha	100	“ Work it all up , and I ’ll decide how I feel about it . End of next week . Can you do it ? ”

14094	14107	14045	14045	Pencil	126	“ Is there a recommended company resource for wake - up calls ? ”
14108	14130	14045	14045	Pencil	126	“ If there were , I would n’t be tasking you with it . Find a service on Craigslist or something . ”
14131	14134	14045	14045	Pencil	126	“ Okay . ”
14135	14150	14045	14045	Pencil	126	“ Arrange the first one for 4:30 Monday morning . Can you handle that ? ”

17479	17488	17489	17489	I	0	“ I just think I should tell you — ”
17516	17534	17510	17510	He	101	“ Was there anything unusual about the way they advertised ? The way they described their service ? ”
17549	17555	17544	17544	Sasha	100	“ Why do you ask ? ”
17571	17575	17576	17576	He	101	“ It was … ”
17586	17594	17576	17576	He	101	“ … unorthodox . I was curious … ”
17622	17629	17630	17630	she	100	“ Nothing out of the ordinary , ”
17633	17647	17630	17630	she	100	“ One wake - up service does n’t tend to differ from another . ”
17669	17677	17678	17678	Sasha	100	“ Is there a problem with it ? ”
17681	17692	17678	17678	Sasha	100	“ Should we get rid of it and find another ? ”
17693	17696	17697	17697	he	101	“ No ! ”
17701	17712	17697	17697	he	101	“ Leave it . This service will do for now . ”
17738	17742	17743	17743	He	101	“ Carry on . ”
17763	17770	17758	17758	Sasha	100	“ Finally you did something right . ”
17774	17782	17771	17771	I	0	“ I ’m glad it worked out . ”
17791	17806	17771	17771	I	0	“ What ’s the deal ? Did you get it off Craigslist or what ? ”
17807	17814	17815	17815	I	0	“ That ’s what you requested , ”
17818	17825	17815	17815	I	0	“ Does it have a name ? ”
17826	17844	17771	17771	I	0	“ Um … I’d have to check . Something really generic . They seemed … competent enough . ”
17845	17860	17861	17861	I	0	“ In an unorthodox way ? Do you know what ’s unorthodox about them ? ”
17869	17879	17866	17866	She	100	“ You do n’t know much , do you ? ”
17880	17888	17889	17889	She	100	“ You want me to research it ? ”
17901	17930	17889	17889	She	100	“ No , we need to keep the site on track . Get me the deets on the wake - up service after you complete your other duties . ”
18303	18309	18310	18310	I	0	“ What ’s the occasion ? ”
18318	18348	18349	18349	I	0	“ I was planning it this morning as a consolation feast . But now it ’s a what - the - fuck celebration . Because , what the fuck ! ”
18352	18357	18349	18349	I	0	“ Can you even ? ”
18358	18362	18363	18363	I	0	“ Not even ! ”
18418	18422	18400	18400	she	117	“ For you . ”
18446	18455	18456	18456	She	117	“ Oh , Mia . I love it ! ”
18461	18488	18456	18456	She	117	“ It ’s almost done . And then I ’m going to frame it . And then you can have it . To always look at . ”
18542	18548	18525	18525	I	0	“ Did you nearly faint ? ”
18549	18554	18555	18555	I	0	“ Rrmm - hmm , ”
18564	18567	18568	18568	she	117	“ Unorthodox , ”
18571	18576	18577	18577	I	0	“ Four more days , ”
18580	18586	18577	18577	I	0	“ I can do this . ”
18587	18598	18599	18599	she	117	“ Are you ready to do a repeat performance tonight ? ”
18602	18613	18599	18599	she	117	“ What ? Of the call ? Are you kidding ? ”
18614	18619	18620	18620	she	117	“ You have to , ”
18623	18627	18628	18628	I	0	“ No way , ”
18640	18705	18628	18628	I	0	“ I was thinking about saying they quit on me and I ’ll get Karin to just do it for the next four days , just do a normal wake - up call . Just get me through to the bonus . Though she can stay on if she wants . She might like it as a side gig . She needs the money . ”
18706	18718	18756	18757	needy actors	674	“ Wait , what ? You ca n’t quit the calls ! ”
18719	18749	18628	18628	I	0	“ Why ? Karin needs the money . If she wo n’t do it , somebody else will . I should ’ve thought of it in the first place . ”
18776	18793	18794	18794	Mia	117	“ You ca n’t just say the mean wake - up service quit after one day , ”
18797	18811	18794	18794	Mia	117	“ Why not ? I ca n’t help it if they ’re flakey . ”
18812	18835	18756	18757	needy actors	674	“ Do n’t rock the boat . He liked the mean wake - up call . You have to do it again . ”
18836	18841	18842	18842	I	0	“ I ca n’t , ”
18845	18851	18842	18842	I	0	“ I just could n’t . ”
18852	18859	18756	18757	needy actors	674	“ You said it felt amazing . ”
18860	18873	18756	18757	needy actors	674	“ But I did n’t know I was actually talking to him . ”
18874	18894	18756	18757	needy actors	674	“ Set your alarm for four and think about what a jerk he is . How controlling he is . ”
18895	18900	18901	18901	I	0	“ He is that . ”
18910	18933	18934	18934	She	678	“ His employees work so hard , and he does n’t care . He wo n’t even let us have microwave popcorn . ”
18974	18989	18990	18990	she	678	“ Microwave popcorn is one of the main sources of office - worker pleasure , ”
18993	19027	18990	18990	she	678	“ I know , right ? He wants us to be machines like him . He leads by fear . Dude , have you heard of twentieth - century leadership techniques ? Seriously . ”
19028	19036	19037	19037	Mia	117	“ See ? That ’s the spirit . ”
19044	19059	19037	19037	Mia	117	“ You just have to replay this whole conversation at four in the morning . ”
19060	19066	19067	19067	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
19088	19110	19075	19075	his	679	“ You get to vent to your asshole boss . Do you know how many people would kill for that opportunity ? ”
19111	19128	19037	19037	Mia	117	“ It ’s risky . What if he figures out I ’m somebody from the office ? ”
19129	19151	19075	19075	his	679	“ Do n’t talk about the office . You ’re a husky - voiced stranger who ’s tired of the patriarchy . ”
19152	19158	19075	19075	his	679	“ It did feel good . ”
19166	19172	19159	19159	I	0	“ And he liked it . ”
19173	19179	19180	19180	I	0	“ He found it unorthodox , ”
19183	19193	19180	19180	I	0	“ I ca n’t imagine that he likes it . ”
19194	19199	19200	19200	she	680	“ Men are weird , ”
19203	19221	19200	19200	she	680	“ He does seem to like unpleasant things . I think his favorite color might be gray . ”
19222	19230	19231	19231	Mia	117	“ Gray is n’t even a color , ”
19234	19242	19231	19231	Mia	117	“ It ’s a shade of black . ”
19243	19255	19256	19256	She	680	“ Yeah ! It ’s a shade of black , motherfucker ! ”
19259	19265	19256	19256	She	680	“ That ’s the spirit ! ”
19280	19293	19294	19294	Mia	117	“ The secret to improv like this is that you just commit , ”
19297	19309	19294	19294	Mia	117	“ Whatever comes out of your mouth , go with it . ”
19310	19356	19357	19357	Mia	117	“ So weird . I ca n’t even look at him at work , or Sasha might think I ’m flirting with him , but I can call him up in the middle of the night and tell him exactly how I feel about him . ”
19363	19368	19357	19357	Mia	117	“ Best job ever . ”
19517	19533	19534	19534	I	0	“ Because you ca n’t or wo n’t learn how to work an alarm clock , ”
19628	19634	19617	19617	I	0	“ Wrath of My Madness . ”
19678	19681	19682	19682	he	684	“ Yeah ? ”
19709	19732	19733	19733	I	0	“ Wake up , you stupid motherfucker . People are waiting for whatever annoying bullshit you have in store for them today . ”
19749	19763	19745	19745	he	684	“ Your hapless minions await whatever stupid bullshit flows from your meteoric mind . ”
19767	19781	19745	19745	he	684	“ So that really is your technique . It was n’t a fluke . ”
19782	19790	19815	19815	he	684	“ You have a problem with it ? ”
19791	19804	19805	19805	I	0	“ Not a problem , other than I just wanted to know . ”
19822	19828	19815	19815	he	684	“ This is about curiosity ? ”
19829	19908	19915	19915	he	684	“ Are you honestly surprised by that ? ‘ Wake up , you stupid motherfucker ’ ? You ’re literally the worst wake - up - call girl on the planet . I thought maybe it was a mistake , but no , it seems that this really is how you wake people up . Frankly , I do n’t understand how you ’re still employed . Because you should n’t be . You absolutely should n’t be . ”
19921	19931	19932	19932	he	684	“ I tried to call back and ask yesterday , ”
19935	19960	19932	19932	he	684	“ You would n’t pick up . You made me wait until now to get my question answered . I do n’t appreciate it . ”
19966	19969	19970	19970	I	0	“ Well … ”
19999	20002	19988	19988	she	100	“ Um … ”
20003	20006	20007	20007	he	684	“ Yes ? ”
20014	20023	20024	20024	I	0	“ But if you were calling me back , ”
20027	20047	20048	20048	I	0	“ it means you were awake , right ? Which means my duty was completed successfully . And efficiently , ”
20051	20074	20048	20048	I	0	“ No , it means you insulted and annoyed a client . Does your boss know you speak to people like that ? ”
20085	20101	20102	20102	he	684	“ Do you not understand how a wake - up call is supposed to go ? ”
20105	20153	20102	20102	he	684	“ Because whatever you think you ’re doing here , it is n’t something I should be asked to pay for . You ’re supposed to call the person and say good morning . Inform him as to the temperature outside and briefly tell him the forecast . ”
20202	20210	20211	20211	he	684	“ Now let ’s try it again , ”
20214	20223	20211	20211	he	684	“ Call me again and do it properly . ”
20224	20230	20182	20182	he	684	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
20231	20241	20211	20211	he	684	“ I ’m trying to do you a favor . ”
20242	20268	20211	20211	he	684	“ You want me to do some role - play now ? And then you ’re going to get me into trouble with my boss ? ”
20269	20288	20182	20182	he	684	“ At least you ’ll know how to do a proper wake - up call in the future . ”
20289	20303	20211	20211	he	684	“ What do you even know about wake - up calls ? Nothing . ”
20304	20315	20316	20316	he	684	“ I know a lot about wake - up calls , ”
20319	20326	20316	20316	he	684	“ More than you might imagine . ”
20327	20334	20335	20335	I	0	“ No , you know nothing . ”
20352	20425	20335	20335	I	0	“ How do you know I ’m not the best wake - up caller on the whole East Coast ? Because guess what ? You are totally awake . I bet you ’re more awake after two minutes of my awesomeness than repeated calls from any other service . Come on , tell me . Has any other service gotten you to the level of alertness that I ’ve gotten you to ? ”
20432	20437	20438	20438	I	0	“ I think not , ”
20441	20448	20438	20438	I	0	“ That ’s not the point . ”
20449	20470	20471	20471	I	0	“ Oh , it ’s totally the point . I ’m amazing , and you are lucky to have me . ”
20486	20489	20490	20490	I	0	“ However , ”
20493	20510	20490	20490	I	0	“ due to your back talk and poor attitude , I ’m thinking about firing you . ”
20511	20515	20541	20541	his	684	“ Excuse me ? ”
20516	20526	20541	20541	his	684	“ You ’re a bad client . The worst . ”
20561	20588	20558	20558	he	684	“ Are you telling me there are people out there who prefer this kind of wake - up call ? This is just what you do ? ”
20629	20635	20625	20625	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
20636	20674	20602	20602	he	684	“ I do n’t know . That ’s why I ’m asking you . Are there other people you speak to like this ? Are there people out there who prefer a rude wake - up call ? ”
20675	20688	20701	20701	his	684	“ That ’s funny , I thought you were the expert here . ”
20689	20694	20701	20701	his	684	“ Answer the question . ”
20766	20769	20770	20770	he	684	“ Well ? ”
20818	20834	20815	20815	I	0	“ I do n’t know if you deserve an answer . What with your attitude . ”
20835	20839	20840	20840	he	684	“ Excuse me ? ”
20843	20848	20840	20840	he	684	“ You heard me . ”
20900	20921	20897	20897	I	0	“ The current temperature at JFK is thirty - seven degrees with periods of light rain forecasted throughout the day . ”
22111	22117	22118	22118	she	735	“ You look nice today , ”
22126	22130	22131	22131	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
22148	22158	22159	22159	She	735	“ Maybe this dress looked better on the rack . ”
22165	22169	22159	22159	She	735	“ Been there . ”
22205	22214	22215	22215	she	735	“ The wake - up - call service , ”
22236	22244	22218	22218	I	0	“ Is it still … working out ? ”
22245	22256	22257	22257	She	735	“ Apparently so . Mr. Drummond wants an extra call . ”
22263	22303	22257	22257	She	735	“ This is his office line , to be used only for the purposes of an extra call to be placed by the current operator he ’s working with . The call is to be made at precisely 9:20 a.m. ”
22304	22307	22308	22308	I	0	“ Huh , ”
22316	22319	22308	22308	I	0	“ Really . ”
22320	22378	22257	22257	She	735	“ Yeah , I do n’t know , maybe he ’s planning a nap up there or something . And you ’re to specifically request that the operator working with the Vossameer account be assigned to this job , but it should n’t be obvious he ’s the client . Have them PayPal invoice me . Understand ? ”
22379	22383	22384	22384	I	0	“ I understand , ”
22409	22427	22428	22428	she	740	“ Unusual , I know . But there ’s always a method to Mr. Drummond ’s madness , ”
22433	22439	22440	22440	I	0	“ Of course there is , ”
22443	22455	22428	22428	she	740	“ But this request is for a call in two hours . ”
22456	22468	22428	22428	she	740	“ Are you saying you think you ca n’t handle it ? ”
22469	22477	22478	22478	I	0	“ I ’ll put in the order , ”
22481	22513	22478	22478	I	0	“ I do n’t know how they assign things over there , in terms of scheduling the operators . I suspect that they might schedule twenty - four hours in advance . ”
22514	22538	22539	22539	She	740	“ Figure it out . Whatever it costs . This is something Mr. Drummond wants , so this is something Mr. Drummond gets . ”
22934	22946	22947	22947	I	0	“ You ’re sure there ’s no way to arrange it … ”
22950	22973	22947	22947	I	0	“ We really would like this call to be made … no , I understand … yes , we are extremely disappointed . ”
22995	23025	22974	22974	I	0	“ The operator he wants is all booked up . They ca n’t give her any more clients . Do you want me to try for a different one ? ”
23026	23041	23042	23042	I	0	“ It ca n’t be a different one . He said her or nobody . ”
23045	23068	23042	23042	I	0	“ I tried everything . They ’re just like , ‘ No , Operator Seven is not available for another call . ’ ”
23086	23103	22974	22974	I	0	“ Not at 9:20 , not at 10:20 , not this morning , not this afternoon … ”
23114	23122	22974	22974	I	0	“ Did you offer them extra money ? ”
23123	23127	23128	23128	I	0	“ Of course , ”
23131	23170	23128	23128	I	0	“ I do n’t think there ’s anything that ’ll sway these people . No dollar figure . Nothing . Looks like I got the last slot open for their very best wake - up - call girl . ”
23174	23200	23201	23201	I	0	“ I do n’t understand . Operator Seven wo n’t take one more spot ? How hard can it be to place one more call ? ”
23204	23215	23201	23201	I	0	“ Again , I could ask about a different operator … ”
23216	23225	23226	23226	I	0	“ No , Mr. Drummond was very specific . ”
23257	23274	23251	23251	Sasha	100	“ When Mr. Drummond finds something that works , he commits to it fully and completely . ”
23275	23286	23326	23326	her	759	“ Yeah . I do n’t know what to say . ”
23287	23293	23294	23294	Sasha	100	“ I do n’t either , ”
23302	23311	23294	23294	Sasha	100	“ He is going to be very disappointed . ”
23368	23380	23381	23381	Sasha	100	“ Well , if they wo n’t , they wo n’t . ”
23410	23420	23421	23421	I	0	“ I do n’t see how that can be , ”
23424	23432	23421	23421	I	0	“ It ’s a simple phone call . ”
23433	23438	23439	23439	she	759	“ My point exactly , ”
23442	23516	23439	23439	she	759	“ It ’s one simple phone call . How is that not doable ? I even offered to pay extra , but they simply were n’t interested . They did n’t even want to talk money . There ’s no more room in her schedule anywhere . It seems that I landed you the last available time slot from their very best and most in - demand wake - up - call girl . ”
23537	23557	23560	23560	she	759	“ It does n’t make sense . A wake - up - call business sells punctuality , not time . ”
23584	23596	23560	23560	she	759	“ Do you want me to try for a different operator ? ”
23597	23600	23601	23601	I	0	“ No ! ”
23611	23615	23616	23616	I	0	“ Never mind , ”

23873	23959	23870	23870	she	759	“ I think you ’re really going to like one of the directions I ’m having the team create . We ’re working up a behind - the - scenes view of the formulation process . A tools - of - the - trade thing . Think beakers and whiteboard shots . Race for a cure . But do n’t worry , we would n’t bother you with it or divulge trade secrets . We ’d have a junior chemist work with marketing on it . ”

Thing one : You ’re a man who ca n’t seem to operate the modern wake - up technologies specifically created for wake - up functions , so you have to hire somebody to do it for you . And then you act like a total jackalope and tell her how to do her job . ”

25737	25751	25752	25752	He	802	“ Because that kind of says it all , do n’t you think ? ”

26170	26186	26187	26187	I	0	“ That ’s for me to know and you to never find out , Theo . ”
26213	26218	26219	26219	he	101	“ Just tell me , ”
26223	26239	26219	26219	he	101	“ Is this your technique with multiple clients ? It ’s not a difficult question . ”

26678	26741	26742	26742	I	0	“ I do n’t know why other guys would want to know that . But personally , I like my woman to have a little bit of clothes on her , so that I have something to rip off of her . That ’s why I asked . Because I need to know what exactly I ’m visualizing myself ripping off you . ”

26822	26834	26812	26812	Mason	137	“ It depends on what qualifies as ‘ ripping off . ’ ”
26835	26840	26841	26841	he	101	“ Oh , Seven , ”
26844	26913	26841	26841	he	101	“ if you have to ask what qualifies as a man ripping off your clothes , then a man has never ripped off your clothes .

26924	26935	26936	26936	he	101	“ Insane from the need to sate himself with you , ”

27006	27016	27017	27017	he	101	“ You ’re right about one thing , though , ”
27020	27037	27017	27017	he	101	“ I am an asshole . And trust me , I could make it so hot . ”
27079	27098	27071	27071	I	0	“ If nothing else , you ’re getting an A for confidence . Or maybe an A minus . ”

27228	27234	27235	27235	he	101	“ No maybe about it , ”

27417	27464	27414	27414	he	101	“ I ’d know how to handle you . You ’d want things good and dirty . So fucking dirty , and you know I ’d deliver . You might even like me to hold you down . Can you feel my hands around your thighs ? ”

27526	27579	27504	27504	He	101	“ You would give yourself over to me , and I would be every inch the asshole you need me to be . I would push you right up to your edge . Maybe a little bit past it . Just a little , though . Just enough to make it interesting . ”
27580	27583	27584	27584	My	0	“ Yeah ? ”

32261	32269	32271	32271	her	146	“ By all means . Ping her . ”
32418	32430	32411	32411	her	146	“ Mr. Drummond ! I hope you were n’t waiting long . ”
32434	32452	32411	32411	her	146	“ I ’m going to need the contact information for the wake - up - call service . ”

32582	32608	32609	32609	Sasha	138	“ Mr. Drummond ? Are you no longer finding it effective ? I could find you a new service . It would be no problem , ”
32612	32640	32609	32609	Sasha	138	“ No , I ’m happy with this service you found . I just need the contact information . The name of the service . The number . ”
32652	32659	32647	32647	I	0	“ Will that be a problem ? ”
32660	32673	32674	32674	She	146	“ Sure , I could get that for you , no problem . ”

32823	32832	32819	32819	she	146	“ Top of my to - do list . ”
32836	32862	32833	32833	I	0	“ Would n’t it be more efficient to have started the reboot process before you left your desk ? It would be rebooted by now . ”
32863	32869	32870	32870	she	146	“ Oh , of course , ”
32873	32894	32870	32870	she	146	“ But I thought you might be up here with an urgent matter . I ’ll have that info ASAP . ”

33082	33095	33096	33096	I	0	“ It might take a bit to put my hands on it , ”
33107	33126	33096	33096	I	0	“ I ’ll have to dig around a bit . I ’m not sure where I put it … ”
33127	33142	33073	33073	her	909	“ How hard can it be ? You got it on Craigslist , right ? ”
33143	33152	33096	33096	I	0	“ Uh … that ’s what you suggested … ”
33153	33181	33096	33096	I	0	“ At some point you were going to have to pass along the details to billing , were you not ? Did you not write it down ? ”
33182	33208	33073	33073	her	909	“ I guess I was in a hurry at the time . I know I can put my hands on it , it ’s just — ”
33209	33226	33096	33096	I	0	“ That you ’re disorganized ? And that your disorganization is affecting the people around you ? ”
33271	33282	33096	33096	I	0	“ That ’s what it ’s called ? Hello Morning ? ”
33283	33288	33254	33254	I	0	“ If I recall . ”

33330	33336	33337	33337	I	0	“ Oh , good idea , ”
33355	33360	33361	33361	I	0	“ Oh , wait , ”

33378	33389	33393	33393	She	912	“ Why on earth would you delete something like that ? ”
33659	33676	33638	33638	her	912	“ I need to take this . Have it to me in five . You understand ? ”
35202	35214	35215	35215	I	0	“ This service does n’t have an address and phone number , ”
35218	35229	35215	35215	I	0	“ I think they send emails from a PayPal address . ”
35230	35244	35194	35194	somebody	346	“ We ca n’t pay them from our system without that contact info . ”
35245	35249	35250	35250	I	0	“ I see , ”
35258	35270	35250	35250	I	0	“ Let me email them and try to get that info . ”
35646	35651	35652	35652	she	960	“ Something ’s fishy , ”
35655	35668	35652	35652	she	960	“ Look at the date . This ad was put up today . ”
35673	35676	35669	35669	She	960	“ Today . ”
35677	35683	35684	35684	I	0	“ I know , right ? ”
35694	35737	35684	35684	I	0	“ It turns out that sometimes the people offering services at Craigslist take down their old ads and put up new ones so that they appear at the top of Craigslist searches . It ’s a known technique that Craigslist frowns on . ”
35738	35741	35742	35742	she	960	“ Hmph , ”
35745	35755	35742	35742	she	960	“ And they do n’t even have a website . ”
35756	35762	35763	35763	I	0	“ I know , right ? ”
35766	35774	35775	35775	she	960	“ Mr. Drummond does n’t like mysteries , ”
35784	35800	35801	35801	She	960	“ This is frustrating for Mr. Drummond , and therefore it ’s frustrating for me . ”
35822	35863	35801	35801	She	960	“ Dig a little , okay ? Google the shit out of Hello Morning and see whether you can get something . Surely there is something out there . Do n’t businesses have to register with the state or something ? ”
35869	35876	35801	35801	She	960	“ I ’ll check it out . ”
35877	35941	36001	36001	she	117	“ Do n’t just check it out , give me answers . You wrangled this service . You need to handle this . I was counting on you to vet it at least a little , but apparently you did n’t do that , and now we ’re stuck with this disruptive situation . I do n’t want to disappoint Mr. Drummond again . ”
35942	35947	35801	35801	She	960	“ I ’m sorry . ”
35948	35957	35958	35958	I	0	“ Do n’t be sorry ; be proactive . ”
35986	35997	36001	36001	she	117	“ Have the answer on my desk in the morning . ”
36020	36030	36031	36031	She	117	“ How ’d the wake - up call go ? ”
36037	36045	36046	36046	I	0	“ Oh , it went … fine . ”
36055	36073	36046	36046	I	0	“ Were you just like , ‘ Wake up , motherfucker ’ ? Did it work again ? ”
36074	36088	36156	36156	I	0	“ Yeah , I guess it worked . It ’s hard to say . ”
36089	36107	36108	36108	She	117	“ Well , you still have a job , right ? So I ’d say it worked . ”
36113	36151	36152	36152	I	0	“ It ’s a very rare opportunity you have here . I hope you ’re appreciating it , because you know I am . You ’re a hero to everyone who ’s ever had a jerky boss . ”
36167	36170	36171	36171	she	117	“ What ? ”
36174	36178	36179	36179	I	0	“ What what ? ”
36182	36193	36179	36179	I	0	“ You have that look like there ’s something more . ”
36194	36202	36161	36161	she	117	“ Why would there be something more ? ”
36203	36225	36226	36226	She	117	“ Because of the look on your face . The wake - up call . What are n’t you telling me ? ”
36238	36242	36234	36234	her	117	“ Screw off ! ”
36246	36279	36280	36280	She	117	“ Oh my god , there ’s a what the size of the Chrysler Building . What happened on that wake - up call ? You ’re so gon na tell me . ”
36285	36292	36280	36280	She	117	“ You have to tell me . ”
36293	36296	36297	36297	I	0	“ Uhhhh . ”
36341	36352	36339	36339	Parisian	151	“ Spill . You made the mean call . Right ? ”
36353	36362	36303	36303	She	117	“ Yeah , I made the mean call . ”
36363	36366	36339	36339	Parisian	151	“ And ? ”
36367	36373	36339	36339	Parisian	151	“ He was into it . ”
36384	36390	36379	36379	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
36397	36442	36391	36391	I	0	“ Here ’s the thing — he ’s become curious . He ’s been trying to get ahold of the firm . He wants to contract with Operator Seven — that ’s me — for … I do n’t know . An exclusive contract . ”
36462	36471	36449	36449	she	117	“ He wants Operator Seven all to himself . ”
36477	36492	36449	36449	she	117	“ That ’s a bit odd . How many naps does that asshole take ? ”
36493	36508	36509	36509	I	0	“ It ’s not the waking - up part that he ’s interested in . ”
36534	36543	36544	36544	My	0	“ Does he want more … rude conversation ? ”
36586	36597	36581	36581	my	0	“ I would n’t say that it stayed rude exactly . ”
36605	36612	36598	36598	Her	117	“ Tell me what that means . ”

36678	36687	36658	36658	I	0	“ It did n’t go quite that far . ”
36688	36704	36705	36705	She	117	“ Quite that far ? Sexy phone calls with your asshole boss is pretty far . ”
36715	36723	36705	36705	She	117	“ Did you get to third base ? ”
36724	36747	36658	36658	I	0	“ I do n’t even know what that means . We were on the phone . Are there bases on the phone ? ”
36757	36779	36748	36748	She	117	“ You have to re - enact it . Play both parts . You call . You ’re lying in bed . ”
36780	36807	36658	36658	I	0	“ I ’m not doing a one - woman show of my almost - phone - sex wake - up call with my boss for you . ”
36808	36814	36815	36815	I	0	“ A true friend would . ”
36823	36828	36829	36829	she	117	“ You have to , ”
36832	36851	36829	36829	she	117	“ At least help me understand how it segued from ‘ you ’re such an asshole ’ to … ”
36879	36883	36884	36884	she	117	“ Come on ! ”
36904	36909	36910	36910	I	0	“ First of all , ”
36913	36931	36910	36910	I	0	“ he has this really rumbly voice . Like it wraps around you . Soft and gritty . ”

36951	36962	36971	36971	She	117	“ Yeah . Or else maybe extremely unforgiving velvet ribbon . ”
36963	36966	36967	36967	she	117	“ Guh , ”
36977	36992	36971	36971	She	117	“ Dude , I had a hard day at work . I need this . ”
36993	37006	37007	37007	She	117	“ One of the early highlights : I called him a jackalope . ”
37011	37017	37007	37007	She	117	“ This is already delicious . ”
37018	37029	36971	36971	She	117	“ Then he wants to know what I ’m wearing . ”
37030	37039	36971	36971	She	117	“ Ooh . A time - honored classic . ”
37040	37047	37007	37007	She	117	“ I was like , seriously ? ”
37048	37065	36971	36971	She	117	“ I ’m rolling with this completely . Did you tell him what you were wearing ? ”
37066	37097	36971	36971	She	117	“ He had guesses . And he was all stern and assholey , but in a good way . And suddenly … we’re all sexytimes . So there you go . ”
37098	37136	36971	36971	She	117	“ Wait , that ’s all I get ? What are you wearing and then it ’s all sexytimes and that ’s that ? No , no , no , no , no . I need details . ”
37137	37142	36971	36971	She	117	“ Sorry , sister . ”
37143	37146	37147	37147	She	117	“ Noooo ! ”
37152	37157	37147	37147	She	117	“ One fun highlight . ”
37161	37164	37158	37158	I	0	“ Please ? ”
37179	37229	37230	37230	She	117	“ ‘ You are such a pig ! ’ I say to him . And then he goes , ‘ Oh , I am . An utter animal . Sex with me is a dirty , savage affair . Utterly uncivilized . It ’s the opposite of civilized . ’ ”
37244	37253	37254	37254	I	0	“ That was your one and only snippet . ”
37290	37298	37286	37286	I	0	“ You ’re like a secret agent . ”
37299	37311	37312	37312	She	117	“ A secret agent who needs her sign - on bonus . ”
37319	37354	37312	37312	She	117	“ And now he wants you all to himself . His sexy wake - up - call girl . Nobody else gets her ! He will search the ends of the earth for her . ”
37355	37441	37442	37442	She	967	“ Let ’s hope not . It was totally entitled and pushy of him to be calling my wake - up agency . Sasha is looking for an excuse to fire me , but does he even consider that ? If it was a real wake - up - call service , what would that look like ? I mean , it would look utterly fishy . Yes , he ’s hot , but he ’s so oblivious to what other people are going through . ”
37445	37448	37442	37442	She	967	“ Mmm . ”
37449	37467	37312	37312	She	117	“ I do n’t need another Mason , involving himself in my life because he wants something . ”
37468	37483	37484	37484	Mia	117	“ Mason was trying to steal your business , doing shit behind your back , ”
37488	37492	37484	37484	Mia	117	“ This guy … ”
37493	37521	37312	37312	She	117	“ This guy is a control freak who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants . You ca n’t trust a guy like that . ”
37522	37531	37312	37312	She	117	“ They ’re not all shitty , Lizzie . ”
37532	37540	37484	37484	Mia	117	“ Three words . Microwave popcorn ban . ”
37554	37587	37546	37546	I	0	“ I ’m keeping things short and sweet tomorrow morning . I ’ll do the minimum to wake him up ; then I ’m out of there . No more extra activity . ”
37588	37603	37312	37312	She	117	“ Extra activity ? Is that what the kids are calling it these days ? ”
37604	37609	37610	37610	I	0	“ This is serious , ”
37613	37649	37610	37610	I	0	“ I doubt he ’ll fire the wake - up service at this point . Two more days , that ’s all I need . I have to keep this job for two more days . ”
37650	37663	37312	37312	She	117	“ You know he ’s going to try to trace the call . ”
37664	37686	37312	37312	She	117	“ Too bad it ’s a burner . Who knew I ’d ever be thankful to Mason for ruining my credit ? ”
37687	37703	37704	37704	Mia	117	“ ’ Sex with me is a dirty , savage affair . Utterly uncivilized , ’ ”
37707	37735	37704	37704	Mia	117	“ I want a boyfriend who says that . And he follows through . Would you be mad if I cross - stitched that for our wall ? ”
37739	37743	37736	37736	I	0	“ Operator Seven . ”

37774	37777	37778	37778	I	0	“ Shut , ”
37784	37791	37781	37781	Mia	117	“ Hot , hot tongue lashings . ”

37802	37833	37799	37799	Mia	117	“ From now on , he gets me just waking him up and I ’m out of there . He ’ll see he ca n’t always have what he wants . ”
37834	37850	37851	37851	She	117	“ I think Operator Seven is looking forward to not giving him what he wants . ”
38025	38033	38034	38034	I	0	“ Time to wake up , motherfucker , ”
38044	38047	38048	38048	he	101	“ Hey , ”
38051	38055	38048	38048	he	101	“ Good morning . ”
38070	38093	38061	38061	his	101	“ It ’s not such a good morning over here . You totally and completely got me in trouble with my boss . ”
38109	38116	38101	38101	he	101	“ I got you in trouble ? ”
38117	38141	38142	38142	He	101	“ You have to stop researching Hello Morning . Stop trying to contact them . Why ca n’t you just leave it alone ? ”
38147	38191	38144	38144	his	101	“ I was interested in contracting for your time . I ’d think it would show you ’re doing a good job , if a client wants more of the service you provide . That ’s typically the sign of a good employee … ”
38192	38247	38144	38144	his	101	“ Oh please with your businessplaining . ‘ I ’d think it would show you ’re doing a good job ’ … Well , it ’s not helpful . You had to rush in there like a bull in a china shop … did you ever give a thought to another person ’s situation ? ”
38248	38255	38144	38144	his	101	“ Tell me about your situation . ”
38256	38277	38278	38278	I	0	“ I ’m not going to tell you about my situation . I ’m going to tell you about yours . ”
38282	38302	38278	38278	I	0	“ You sit there in your lofty office , and you are so oblivious , it blows my mind . ”
38303	38308	38144	38144	his	101	“ Oblivious to what ? ”
38309	38338	38278	38278	I	0	“ The effects of your actions ! Seriously . You do n’t see what you do or what ’s in front of you . That ’s your problem . ”

38411	38472	38401	38401	he	974	“ I just do n’t want attention drawn to me . How do you think it looks when a wake - up - call client is suddenly coming back with extra questions and requests for more time ? You need to think a little harder about how your actions affect those around you . And I mean all your actions . ”
38473	38478	38494	38494	he	974	“ I did n’t … ”
38479	38482	38483	38483	I	0	“ Think ? ”
38504	38509	38494	38494	he	974	“ I ’m sorry . ”

38571	38590	38549	38549	Mason	137	“ Is that so hard to believe ? I did n’t mean to make things hard for you . ”
38591	38598	38599	38599	I	0	“ Well , I appreciate that , ”
38602	38608	38599	38599	I	0	“ Tell me your name . ”

38693	38705	38683	38683	I	0	“ You do n’t need my name for what we do . ”
38706	38715	38754	38754	his	974	“ What harm could a first name do ? ”
38716	38734	38735	38735	He	974	“ I do n’t know . What if it ’s really unusual ? Like Sassafras or something . ”
38785	38789	38790	38790	he	974	“ Tell me , ”
38798	38803	38804	38804	I	0	“ I ca n’t , ”

38882	38891	38838	38838	He	974	“ Let me take you out . Tonight . ”
38892	38897	38838	38838	He	974	“ Are you serious ? ”
38898	38904	38909	38909	he	974	“ I ’m always serious . ”
38915	38926	38909	38909	he	974	“ You do n’t even know what I look like . ”
38927	38939	38940	38940	he	974	“ I do n’t have to know what you look like , ”
38943	38946	38940	38940	he	974	“ Risky . ”
38947	38978	38909	38909	he	974	“ I always know what I want . I enjoy you . What do I care what you look like ? I ’m a chemist . I care about chemistry . ”
39017	39023	39006	39006	he	974	“ Not gon na happen . ”
39024	39042	38909	38909	he	974	“ Why ? Is it because you are n’t single ? Because you do n’t like men ? ”
39043	39099	39006	39006	he	974	“ So those are the only two choices ? I must be married or not into men if I wo n’t go out to dinner with you ? Because otherwise , wild horses would n’t keep me away ? Is that what you ’re thinking ? Because any single hetero woman would totally say yes ? ”
39100	39104	39105	39105	I	0	“ Pretty much . ”
39108	39115	39105	39105	I	0	“ It ’s just a fact . ”
39154	39172	39136	39136	he	974	“ Well , you ’ll have to find one of those other legions of women to ask . ”
39173	39204	39205	39205	I	0	“ I want it to be you . Think of a restaurant . Any restaurant in Manhattan . The best restaurant you ’ve never gotten a chance to go to . ”
39217	39263	39205	39205	I	0	“ Do you not have enough romantic challenges in your life ? Is that it ? So you have to see whether you can land the strangely resistant wake - up - call girl ? Is this your version of the Iron Man or something ? ”
39264	39269	39270	39270	he	985	“ Anywhere . Anytime , ”
39273	39286	39270	39270	he	985	“ Trust me , you ’ll want to say yes to this . ”
39287	39291	39205	39205	I	0	“ Arrogant much ? ”
39292	39299	39300	39300	I	0	“ Not arrogant . Just realistic . ”

39381	39392	39393	39393	he	985	“ That wo n’t work for me , Operator Seven , ”
39408	39412	39393	39393	he	985	“ Try again . ”
39418	39422	39423	39423	I	0	“ Not happening , ”
39430	39444	39423	39423	I	0	“ Eventually you ’re going to say yes . We both know it . ”
39454	39462	39451	39451	he	985	“ We ’ll see , Mr. Drummond . ”
39463	39472	39423	39423	I	0	“ Did you just call me Mr. Drummond ? ”
39494	39523	39479	39484	the only people in his life	986	“ You ’ve been demoted from Theo . And if you ’re out of line one more time , you ’ll be demoted further . To just Drummond . ”
39524	39557	39558	39558	My	0	“ Give me one actually valid reason we ca n’t meet . You ’ve been thinking about me . You pictured me while you got yourself off after our last phone call . ”
39566	39574	39575	39575	His	985	“ Of course you would think that . ”
39579	39590	39575	39575	His	985	“ I do n’t think that , I know it . ”
39591	39602	39575	39575	His	985	“ Okay , I ’m officially calling you Drummond now . ”
39603	39621	39575	39575	His	985	“ If I ’d been there in person , you ’d ’ve had a much better time . ”
39622	39639	39575	39575	His	985	“ Right , I forgot . You could do me better than I could do myself . ”
39640	39653	39654	39654	I	0	“ You would n’t forget that if you went out with me . ”
39790	39799	39800	39800	I	0	“ We ’re not going out to dinner , ”
39803	39818	39800	39800	I	0	“ It ’s just impossible . There are crucial business reasons that prevent it . ”
39819	39833	39760	39760	Lenny	119	“ How about I buy the company and change those crucial business reasons ? ”
39839	39857	39760	39760	Lenny	119	“ How about if you try to do that , you ’ll never hear from me again ? ”
39858	39876	39800	39800	I	0	“ I ’ll hear from you again . You ’re my wake - up - call girl . ”
39877	39910	39800	39800	I	0	“ You sure I ’ll stay your wake - up - call girl ? Your company ordered wake - up calls . Watch out , I might switch with operator number five . ”
39911	39943	39944	39944	I	0	“ No , you wo n’t . You have to call me . You would n’t trade with anyone even if you could . You like what I do to you . ”
39948	39953	39944	39944	I	0	“ Do go on . ”
39954	39969	39970	39970	I	0	“ You ca n’t get enough . And you know what else I think ? ”
39999	40009	39990	39990	I	0	“ I know you ’re going to tell me . ”
40010	40035	40036	40036	I	0	“ I think you do n’t talk to anybody else the way you talk to me . I think I ’m the only one . ”
40039	40045	40036	40036	I	0	“ You so desperately hope . ”
40091	40112	40113	40113	I	0	“ Look , I ’m going to be honest here , since that seems to be a thing with you , ”
40116	40146	40113	40113	I	0	“ You are the only one I ever talk to like this . I promise . But you have to stop poking at the company . You really do . ”

40168	40174	40175	40175	he	993	“ Why ? Why me ? ”
40178	40199	40175	40175	he	993	“ Why did you decide to wake me up like that the first day ? Was it something you read ? ”
40200	40219	40048	40048	his	993	“ I ’m not getting into that with you . I ’m saying , stop contacting the company . ”
40220	40234	40048	40048	his	993	“ How about if I pass along praise for a job well done ? ”
40235	40255	40048	40048	his	993	“ I guess there ’s no harm in saying that you ’re happy with Hello Morning ’s amazing service . ”
40256	40285	40048	40048	his	993	“ Especially since my wake - up - call girl has agreed to dinner . She knows I need more of her than her sexy , raspy voice . ”
40303	40321	40292	40292	I	0	“ That had better not be a quid pro quo , because it ’s so not happening . ”
40322	40327	40328	40328	he	993	“ It ’ll happen , ”
40331	40369	40328	40328	he	993	“ You ’ll keep calling me . And you ’ll keep thinking about me after . How dirty and good I can make things for you . You know who I am . You ’ll say yes . ”
40370	40432	40448	40448	his	994	“ I think the only reason you want me to go out with you is because I said no . Everything ’s too easy for you . And suddenly you come across the one woman who seems immune to your charms . So you ’ve decided to seduce me at all costs . Seduce the wake - up - call girl . ”
40433	40445	40446	40446	He	994	“ I already seduced the wake - up - call girl . ”
40455	40463	40448	40448	his	994	“ Now I need to taste her . ”
40479	40488	40489	40489	he	994	“ I need to have you under me , ”
40492	40509	40489	40489	he	994	“ I need you to talk to me just like this while I fuck you senseless . ”
40510	40522	40547	40547	him	994	“ Are we approaching the savage animal portion of the call ? ”
40523	40531	40489	40489	he	994	“ We could be so good together . ”
40561	40567	40551	40551	I	0	“ Put us on FaceTime . ”
40568	40573	40489	40489	he	994	“ I ca n’t . ”
40574	40578	40579	40579	he	994	“ Do it , ”
40589	40612	40613	40613	He	994	“ I ’m not that kind of wake - up - call girl . No vid . No texts . No sexting . ”
40618	40630	40615	40615	his	994	“ I want to see you . Any part of you . ”
40631	40635	40489	40489	he	994	“ No go . ”
40636	40644	40645	40645	he	994	“ If you had me on FaceTime , ”
40648	40677	40645	40645	he	994	“ you ’d be able to see me up close , and you ’d see that I have a scar on the left side of my lower lip . ”
40685	40688	40682	40682	I	0	“ And ? ”
40689	40698	40715	40715	My	0	“ Are you lying down ? Lie back . ”
40699	40706	40707	40707	I	0	“ Now you ’re commanding me ? ”
40729	40753	40723	40723	I	0	“ You ca n’t see my scar that well , but when you touch it , there ’s a little edge to it . ”
40754	40760	40715	40715	My	0	“ What ’s it from ? ”
40761	40830	40723	40723	I	0	“ Boyhood fight that split open my lip . My point is , can you imagine how it would feel on your nipple ? My stiff tongue . My soft lips . And then this little edge . You ’d like the way it feels . I would make you enjoy it . With that fucking attitude of yours , you need to be made to feel everything . ”
40831	40834	40835	40835	I	0	“ Oh , ”
40846	40850	40851	40851	he	996	“ Or maybe , ”
40854	40895	40851	40851	he	996	“ … maybe I kiss you and let you feel the scar first , before I put you in a trance of pleasure with my tongue . What do you think ? Which one do you think would be best ? ”
40896	40907	40908	40908	I	0	“ I do n’t know which one would be best . ”
40922	40937	40908	40908	I	0	“ Maybe we need to get a debate team to take up the question . ”
40942	40954	40938	40938	He	996	“ Trust me , you ’ll want to decide for yourself . ”
40960	40965	40955	40955	He	996	“ There it is . ”
40966	40969	40955	40955	He	996	“ What ? ”
40970	40988	40989	40989	I	0	“ Clothes shifting . The slide of skin against skin . Where is your hand right now ? ”
40994	40998	40999	40999	I	0	“ My stomach , ”

41034	41039	41031	41031	I	0	“ Sliding over it . ”
41040	41047	41061	41061	his	996	“ What does it feel like ? ”
41048	41053	41054	41054	He	996	“ Pebbly . Rough . ”
41068	41077	41078	41078	he	996	“ Down now . We ’re doing this , ”
41081	41087	41078	41078	he	996	“ Are you with me ? ”

41299	41331	41296	41296	he	997	“ I ’ll have to work to be gentle with you . Because being gentle , once I get my hands on you , it ’ll be furthest from my mind . ”
41332	41335	41336	41336	I	0	“ Right , ”
41339	41379	41336	41336	I	0	“ Even with me being gentle , you ’ll be able to feel the ragged energy in my touch . It ’s dangerous as hell how bad I want you . How savage I want to be with you . ”

41536	41568	41569	41569	I	0	“ I ’d be wearing my lab coat . Of course I would . I ’d strip you naked , but I ’d have my lab coat on over my suit . ”

41737	41759	41760	41760	I	0	“ I ca n’t be any other way with you . I yank the fabric , tear it down the middle . ”
41781	41784	41768	41769	Mr. Drummond	101	“ Yeah . ”
41785	41840	41768	41769	Mr. Drummond	101	“ It hurts a little when I rip it , because of how hard I have to yank , but you like it . Because this is way too real . I ’m ripping your pj pants , destroying your panties . I have your nipple in my lips before you can stop me . ”
41841	41844	41845	41845	I	0	“ Ungh , ”
41868	41872	41873	41873	he	101	“ How hard ? ”
41876	41888	41873	41873	he	101	“ Tell me . I always make you tell me everything . ”
41889	41893	41894	41894	I	0	“ Medium hard , ”
41897	41913	41894	41894	I	0	“ A tiny bit of pain . Just enough to surprise me . No more . ”
41919	41923	41924	41924	he	101	“ Like that , ”
41927	41931	41932	41932	I	0	“ Like that , ”
41949	41952	41942	41942	he	101	“ Yes . ”
41953	42026	41942	41942	he	101	“ I ’m back at your clothes , pulling them off you . I do n’t give a shit , I have to get you naked for what I ’m going to do to you , how I ’m going to use your body . The cool air hits your skin . You ’re quivering below me . Of course , I have n’t even bothered to take off my lab coat . ”
42027	42034	41942	41942	he	101	“ Because you ’re an asshole . ”
42035	42068	41942	41942	he	101	“ An asshole who has you totally bared and exposed under him . And I ca n’t believe how beautiful you are like that . I ’m doing you how I want . ”
42069	42083	42084	42084	I	0	“ And I ’m into it , but a little angry , still , ”
42132	42186	42119	42119	He	1001	“ You ca n’t believe you ’d fuck somebody like me , because you hate me a little bit , but it ’s what you need . My lab coat hangs open over you , and sometimes it grazes your skin . I ’m the asshole who is going crazy to fuck you . ”
42187	42192	42193	42193	I	0	“ Like some savage , ”
42196	42240	42241	42241	he	1003	“ I ’ll make you beg , just because I can . Then I ’ll make you come until you cry . Because I ’m the asshole who makes it good for you . Get on your back . Get your legs wider , ”
42262	42266	42251	42251	he	1003	“ Right here . ”
42267	42271	42272	42272	he	1003	“ Not yet , ”
42275	42323	42272	42272	he	1003	“ I ’m not done with you . Not done kissing your pretty cunt . You can feel my scar so acutely . You squirm around , but I clamp my rough hands down on your silky thighs . Press you open to me . So good . ”
42324	42327	42328	42328	I	0	“ Yes , ”
42331	42372	42328	42328	I	0	“ I can hear you breathing , I know you feel it . Now listen — two fingers now . Go a little harder than you normally would . That ’s me , taking a good long lick . Again . ”
42380	42411	42373	42373	I	0	“ You ’re almost gone . You ’re trying to hold it together , but you ca n’t . This asshole you disdain has utter and complete control of you . ”
42420	42427	42428	42428	His	1005	“ You ’re close , Seven . ”
42438	42443	42428	42428	His	1005	“ So fucking close . ”
42479	42482	42483	42483	he	1005	“ Yeah , ”
42490	42510	42483	42483	he	1005	“ Come for me . I ’m slowing down . Stringing it out for you … that ’s it . ”
42517	42529	42511	42511	He	1005	“ Goddamn , you ’re hot . So hot and dirty . ”
42557	42565	42566	42566	he	1005	“ I would kiss you right now , ”
42569	42573	42566	42566	he	1005	“ You would ? ”
42581	42603	42574	42574	I	0	“ I love kissing you . You ’re unlike any woman I ’ve ever met , and it drives me wild . ”
42609	42641	42642	42642	He	1005	“ I get you nice and close to me now . You ’re soft to me now , and you ’ll let me do anything . So I pull you close . ”
42645	42671	42642	42642	He	1005	“ Maybe I put you a little bit under me . I do n’t squish you , but I know you like to feel me . ”
42672	42675	42607	42607	Floating	154	“ Yeah . ”
42676	42716	42717	42717	I	0	“ Your skin is warm , and there ’s a sheen of sweat on your forehead . A drugged look in your eyes . You ’re floppy as a rag doll . That ’s what I do to you . ”
42760	42764	42765	42765	I	0	“ I feel … ”
42792	42795	42789	42789	he	1006	“ Yeah . ”
42796	42805	42806	42806	I	0	“ I do n’t know what this is , ”
42809	42814	42806	42806	I	0	“ Me , either . ”
42871	42876	42867	42867	My	0	“ I should go . ”
42877	42880	42881	42881	he	1006	“ Wait , ”
42897	42900	42884	42884	I	0	“ What ? ”
42901	42914	42915	42915	I	0	“ I hope I have n’t made you miss your next call . ”
42926	42933	42923	42923	I	0	“ Nothing would make you happier . ”
42934	42952	42953	42953	he	1006	“ Here ’s what I do n’t get . It sounded like you were all booked up , ”
42956	42966	42953	42953	he	1006	“ Yet here you are on an extended chat . ”
42994	43005	43006	43006	He	1006	“ Maybe I book this long with all of them . ”
43013	43020	43010	43010	I	0	“ Kidding . I do n’t . ”
43021	43027	43028	43028	he	1006	“ Let me ask you , ”
43031	43055	43028	43028	he	1006	“ Why are you a wake - up - call girl ? Surely this ca n’t be what you want with your life . ”
43056	43071	43010	43010	I	0	“ You think being a wake - up - call girl is too lowly ? ”
43072	43082	43010	43010	I	0	“ I think you ’re more ambitious than that . ”
43083	43090	43028	43028	he	1006	“ You do n’t know me . ”
43091	43213	43010	43010	I	0	“ Do n’t I ? I know you said something outrageous during our first call . You were coloring outside the lines . Experimenting . Or maybe it was an accident . I sometimes think that . I do n’t know why you said it , but you did , and then you went with it . Followed where it led . That ’s what a creative , ambitious person does . She tries different angles . Turns accidents into advantages . It makes me think you ’re used to running your own show . Not doing a job a machine could do . You make things happen . You have a strong will . Yet you have integrity , too . ”
43214	43220	43010	43010	I	0	“ Integrity . My goodness . ”
43221	43250	43010	43010	I	0	“ If you did n’t have integrity , I think you would ’ve taken me up on dinner . Or tried to squeeze me for money by now . ”
43251	43267	43010	43010	I	0	“ Maybe I ’m playing the long game . Maybe I ’m just that good . ”
43268	43327	43328	43328	I	0	“ You ’re not working me . No , I ’d know if you were working me . What ’s more , you do n’t take shit from me . You ’re capable and you stick up for yourself . So what are you doing making wake - up calls ? That ’s what I keep asking myself . ”
43422	43428	43522	43522	he	137	“ Are n’t you observant . ”
43429	43489	43522	43522	he	137	“ I ’m a scientist . Observant is part of the job description . Still , what I ca n’t figure out is why you get so nervous when I set my sights on Hello Morning . Why do you care so deeply about a job you ’re so utterly overqualified for ? As if it ’s a lifeline . ”
43490	43498	43504	43504	he	137	“ Do you analyze everyone like this ? ”
43499	43503	43504	43504	he	137	“ Just you , ”
43604	43624	43625	43625	he	101	“ For a moment , I thought maybe you ’re homebound , somehow , or maybe caring for somebody , ”
43628	43688	43625	43625	he	101	“ But homebound or not , with your communication abilities and apparent control over your schedule , you ’d be doing something that pays better . Sometimes I wonder whether you ’re on the run or hiding . That would give you time on your hands , and also explain why you wo n’t go to dinner with me . ”
43692	43709	43625	43625	he	101	“ And we ’re back to that , folks ! The most baffling question of all . ”
43710	43718	43719	43719	I	0	“ It is the most baffling question . ”
43722	43734	43719	43719	I	0	“ Then I think to myself , are you in trouble ? ”
43740	43746	43735	43735	His	101	“ Is somebody threatening you ? ”
43747	43756	43757	43757	I	0	“ Your imagination is definitely running wild now , ”
43787	43835	43784	43784	I	0	“ Answer me . Do you feel unsafe ? Is your boss at Hello Morning the problem ? Is it a boyfriend ? A husband ? An ex ? If you ’re feeling unsafe , you should tell me . You really , really should tell me . ”
43836	43839	43847	43847	His	101	“ Drummond — ”
43840	43846	43847	43847	His	101	“ I can be persuasive . ”
43896	43898	43916	43916	I	0	“ helping ”
43908	43915	43916	43916	I	0	“ I ’m not feeling unsafe , ”
43928	43932	43916	43916	I	0	“ You promise ? ”
43933	43936	43937	43937	I	0	“ Promise , ”
43956	43960	43916	43916	I	0	“ All right . ”
43961	44037	44038	44038	He	1020	“ Just stop trying to contact Hello Morning , okay ? And FYI , my boss at Hello Morning is a woman , and she ’s absolutely awesome . Promise you will only have praise for me and my service . Or even better , leave it alone . Listen to me for real here . The fastest way to ensure you never hear from me ever again is to get involved in my life . ”
44042	44053	44054	44054	I	0	“ I ’m pretty freaking capable , do n’t forget , ”
44057	44079	44054	44054	I	0	“ Things are under control over here . Stop being so serious . This is just a wake - up call . ”
44113	44129	44110	44110	He	1020	“ I ’m not serious , I ’m realistic . People frequently confuse the two . ”
44130	44135	44091	44091	he	1020	“ Realistic , then . ”
44136	44149	44110	44110	He	1020	“ I see things for what they are . No candy coating . ”
44150	44158	44110	44110	He	1020	“ What ’s wrong with candy coating ? ”
44159	44165	44110	44110	He	1020	“ It ’s a lie . ”
44166	44179	44110	44110	He	1020	“ I ’m guessing you do n’t like jelly beans , then . ”
44180	44213	44110	44110	He	1020	“ I do n’t mind candy coating on candy . It ’s everywhere else that it annoys me . Family pictures at Christmas . The smile on the barista taking your order … ”
44214	44221	44110	44110	He	1020	“ What , you hate kindness ? ”
44222	44230	44110	44110	He	1020	“ Kindness is just another survival strategy . ”
44231	44245	44110	44110	He	1020	“ Oh my god . That is such a sad thing to think . ”
44246	44252	44110	44110	He	1020	“ Realistic is not sad . ”
44253	44260	44110	44110	He	1020	“ You know what you need ? ”
44261	44266	44110	44110	He	1020	“ You at dinner ? ”
44267	44288	44110	44110	He	1020	“ No , you need some baby goat videos in your life . That ’s what I ’m getting here . ”
44289	44300	44301	44301	I	0	“ Baby goat videos ? Is that a thing now ? ”
44304	44313	44301	44301	I	0	“ Yes , and you so need them . ”
44346	44352	44353	44353	he	1021	“ Tell me something else , ”
44356	44360	44353	44353	he	1021	“ Something small . ”
44383	44396	44368	44368	he	1021	“ Is there a man in your life ? A significant other ? ”
44397	44407	44368	44368	he	1021	“ That ’s not small , that ’s invasive . ”
44408	44414	44415	44415	he	1021	“ I have a code , ”
44418	44429	44415	44415	he	1021	“ I do n’t go for other guys ’ women . ”
44436	44451	44452	44452	I	0	“ Nobody ’s going for anybody here . We ’re voices on the phone , ”
44455	44460	44461	44461	he	1021	“ We ’re more , ”
44464	44471	44461	44461	he	1021	“ Now who ’s candy coating ? ”
44472	44479	44480	44480	he	1021	“ Tell me you feel it , ”
44486	44493	44494	44494	I	0	“ There ’s no significant other , ”
44512	44527	44501	44501	he	1021	“ But you ca n’t be going for me . This is n’t that . ”
44528	44535	44553	44553	He	1021	“ Tell me another little thing . ”
44536	44540	44553	44553	He	1021	“ So demanding . ”
44541	44552	44553	44553	He	1021	“ It ’s one of your favorite things about me . ”
44586	44595	44596	44596	he	101	“ You wo n’t let me see you , ”
44599	44625	44596	44596	he	101	“ You wo n’t let me meet you . Give me this . What would you do today if you could do anything at all ? ”
44674	44688	44693	44693	he	101	“ No , my turn . What time do you go to sleep ? ”
44689	44692	44693	44693	he	101	“ Midnight , ”
44696	44709	44693	44693	he	101	“ What ? So you get four hours of sleep a night ? ”
44710	44716	44693	44693	he	101	“ Four and a half . ”
44717	44720	44721	44721	I	0	“ Jesus , ”
44724	44730	44721	44721	I	0	“ That ’s not enough . ”
44731	44744	44745	44745	he	101	“ It ’s fine . I drink a lot of bulletproof coffee , ”
44748	44757	44758	44758	I	0	“ As if that makes up for sleep , ”
44786	44796	44797	44797	I	0	“ Hold on , I know what you need , ”
44810	44815	44800	44800	I	0	“ Are you there ? ”
44816	44822	44833	44833	him	101	“ Yeah , hold on . ”
44837	44877	44831	44831	I	0	“ Hold on , here . You can text me , but I ca n’t text you ? You get to call me and text me whenever you want , and the rest of the time you block me ? ”
44878	44905	44910	44910	him	101	“ Correct . You can not text me , but I can text you . You can not call me , but I can call you . ”
44921	44927	44928	44928	he	101	“ This is a video , ”
44931	44935	44936	44936	I	0	“ Hit play , ”
44939	44951	44936	44936	I	0	“ I ’ll only answer your question if you watch it . ”
44952	44958	44959	44959	he	101	“ It ’s baby goats , ”
44962	44970	44959	44959	he	101	“ Why am I watching baby goats ? ”
44991	44999	44980	44981	Baby goats	2689	“ I think you just need it . ”
45005	45011	45002	45002	him	101	“ Okay . They pranced . ”
45012	45034	44959	44959	he	101	“ Do n’t you love it ? How they kind of pop up into the air ? Watch the whole thing . ”
45071	45080	45081	45081	He	101	“ Come on . How sweetly they play ? ”
45085	45092	45093	45093	I	0	“ With their cute little faces , ”
45096	45109	45093	45093	I	0	“ You need to see that not everything is about grim survival . ”
45110	45157	45081	45081	He	101	“ Their cute little faces are exactly about survival . Baby animals all have large eyes and big foreheads because adult mammals are hardwired to consider it cute and feed them . It ’s pure , vicious survival . Survival of the fittest . Practically mercenary . ”
45158	45172	45093	45093	I	0	“ Oh my god , are you ruining baby goat videos for me ? ”
45173	45218	45249	45249	him	101	“ I ’m telling you what we ’re looking at . Over time , adult goats were more likely to nurture babies who fit the look you see here and the goats with those traits were more likely to survive to adulthood to reproduce . ”
45219	45226	45227	45227	I	0	“ Wait , how about this . ”
45286	45289	45290	45290	he	101	“ Okay , ”
45294	45312	45290	45290	he	101	“ I think I did my time . Tell me the one thing you ’d do today . ”
45313	45316	45317	45317	I	0	“ Bake , ”
45323	45342	45317	45317	I	0	“ I ’d bake cookies . That ’s what I ’d do today if I could do anything . ”
45343	45346	45354	45354	he	101	“ Cookies . ”
45358	45369	45370	45370	I	0	“ There ’s nothing like the aroma of baking cookies , ”
45398	45408	45409	45409	I	0	“ I ’m sensing you do n’t like cookies , ”
45412	45423	45409	45409	I	0	“ What the hell is wrong with cookies , Drummond ? ”
45435	45446	45432	45432	her	1028	“ What the hell is wrong with cookies , Drummond ? ”
45516	45523	45505	45505	she	1028	“ Who does n’t like cookies ? ”
45524	45531	45532	45532	I	0	“ They ’re a useless food , ”
45535	45543	45544	45544	she	1028	“ It ’s National Pug Dog Day , ”
45548	45554	45544	45544	she	1028	“ Did you know that ? ”
45595	45637	45644	45644	her	1028	“ I would bake the cookies and frost them in honor of National Pug Dog Day . And get this — I would spend a lot of time on each cookie . Beautifully and meticulously frosting each for no reason whatsoever . ”
45657	45673	45674	45674	she	1028	“ A cookie that somebody would eat in a second for the most useless holiday , ”
45677	45690	45674	45674	she	1028	“ What do you think ? What ’s your opinion on that ? ”
45691	45699	45700	45700	I	0	“ I think you ’re taunting me , ”
45713	45723	45700	45700	I	0	“ Come on , tell me what you think . ”
45724	45758	45674	45674	she	1028	“ What I think is that I ca n’t decide whether I want to shove you against the wall and kiss that smile right off your lips or move right into spanking you . ”
45759	45764	45765	45765	she	1028	“ I ’m sorry , ”
45780	45799	45765	45765	she	1028	“ I ’ll be too busy baking useless cookies for that . And they will smell so amazing . ”
45846	45874	45915	45915	her	1028	“ I would watch my favorite musical while I bake . Funny Face . Have you ever seen it ? It ’s a musical with Audrey Hepburn . ”
45875	45878	45879	45879	I	0	“ Musicals , ”
45882	45892	45879	45879	I	0	“ You just do n’t quit , do you ? ”
45893	45912	45913	45913	She	1028	“ I love musicals . The story goes along , and then they break into song and dance . ”
45926	45932	45915	45915	her	1028	“ For no reason whatsoever . ”
45969	45990	45991	45991	she	1028	“ And she wears this red dress and sings on the steps of the Louvre . It ’s the best , ”
45994	46002	45991	45991	she	1028	“ And cookies are a valuable food . ”
46006	46009	46003	46003	I	0	“ Hardly . ”
46010	46019	46020	46020	she	1028	“ Did somebody slip you a bad cookie ? ”
46023	46032	46020	46020	she	1028	“ Did somebody have a traumatizing cookie experience ? ”
46039	46047	46033	46033	She	1028	“ Never mind . I ’m sorry . ”
46150	46155	46156	46156	I	0	“ Just do n’t , ”
46159	46164	46156	46156	I	0	“ Do n’t what ? ”
46165	46229	46126	46126	He	1038	“ Do n’t do what you just did . Assume that my dislike of cookies is because of a tragedy that happened half a lifetime ago . Apparently there ca n’t be an article written about me without some armchair psychologist weaving that narrative about my never quite recovering from that . As if it drives everything I do . It ’s ignorant … ”
46230	46245	46156	46156	I	0	“ Well , you did invent the one thing that might ’ve saved her . ”
46246	46306	46343	46343	her	1043	“ Yes , maybe it would ’ve saved her , who knows , but this bullshit story that I heroically dedicate my life to Vossameer to spare others the pain and so forth … it ’s simply not accurate . I promise you . It ’s not how it was , and it ’s not how it is now . ”
46307	46310	46343	46343	her	1043	“ Okay . ”
46311	46317	46318	46318	I	0	“ It ’s fucking annoying , ”
46322	46325	46318	46318	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
46417	46439	46440	46440	My	0	“ When people say that about me , when they go on like that , it makes me feel … alone . ”
46474	46480	46481	46481	she	1043	“ Makes you feel alone , ”
46560	46567	46568	46568	I	0	“ I do n’t know why , ”
46574	46637	46568	46568	I	0	“ It ’s as if those fake stories that paint me to be a heroic phoenix , rising from tragedy or some such shit — it ’s as if they ’re about somebody else . They ’re painting a picture of somebody else . And they leave me feeling alone . I want for somebody to not do that . One person . ”
46638	46641	46642	46642	she	1043	“ Isolated , ”
46645	46651	46642	46642	she	1043	“ The stories isolate you . ”
46652	46657	46658	46658	My	0	“ Yes , exactly . ”
46667	46673	46674	46674	she	1043	“ I ’ll do it , ”
46677	46693	46674	46674	she	1043	“ It ’s official , then . You ’re no hero . Just Theo Drummond . ”
46697	46701	46694	46694	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
46702	46715	46658	46658	My	0	“ Theo Drummond . Just some jackalope on my roster of calls . ”
46716	46726	46694	46694	I	0	“ Well , no need to go that far . ”
46727	46737	46738	46738	I	0	“ You and your innovations . Whatevs , dude . ”
46767	46780	46759	46759	I	0	“ You want to know what else is messed up about it ? ”
46781	46784	46785	46785	she	1043	“ What ? ”
46820	46834	46835	46835	I	0	“ A little - known secret about being a so - called hero , ”
46838	46860	46835	46835	I	0	“ When you go around saying you ’re not a hero , people are even more eager to call you one . ”
46861	46872	46873	46873	she	1043	“ Heroes are notorious for saying they ’re not heroes , ”
46876	46897	46873	46873	she	1043	“ It ’s like one of those finger traps that tighten the harder you try to pull out of them . ”
46898	46931	46835	46835	I	0	“ Maybe you need to walk around like , ‘ yeah , I ’m a hero , biotches . Screw you all . I ’m the greatest hero in the world ! ’ ”
46994	47002	46988	46988	she	1043	“ I suppose that would do it . ”
47003	47007	47008	47008	I	0	“ Too extreme ? ”
47016	47029	47008	47008	I	0	“ Where are you right now ? Kitchen , bedroom , office … ”
47046	47049	47033	47033	she	1043	“ Bedroom . ”
47050	47057	47033	47033	she	1043	“ What does it look like ? ”
47058	47071	47033	47033	she	1043	“ I think I need to take a broom to the ceiling . ”
47072	47079	47033	47033	she	1043	“ What color is your ceiling ? ”
47080	47092	47033	47033	she	1043	“ White . It ’s got gorgeous crown molding , though . ”
47093	47100	47033	47033	she	1043	“ You like a nice ceiling . ”
47138	47151	47133	47133	She	1043	“ My favorite is the pressed tin ceilings . The real ones . ”
47158	47178	47155	47155	I	0	“ Come on , you ’ll go out to dinner with me eventually . Why not just say yes ? ”
47179	47192	47193	47193	She	1043	“ Yeah , well , I hate to say this , but … ”
47198	47213	47193	47193	She	1043	“ I hear you ’re not the hero everyone makes you out to be . ”
47214	47225	47195	47195	her	1043	“ I ’m something better . I ’m an asshole . ”
47226	47238	47195	47195	her	1043	“ An asshole , and you ’ll make it SO good . ”
47303	47327	47300	47300	she	1043	“ I ’m the asshole who ’ll never candy coat things for you . But I can give you what you really want . ”
47330	47336	47300	47300	she	1043	“ Tell me your name . ”
47359	47363	47364	47364	she	1043	“ The weather , ”
47367	47370	47364	47364	she	1043	“ No . ”
47387	47400	47385	47385	her	1043	“ The weather at JFK is forty - five and partly cloudy . ”
48091	48097	48098	48098	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
48101	48115	48098	48098	I	0	“ Good . Except you have two whoms . Who says whom anymore ? ”
48116	48120	48121	48121	I	0	“ I do . ”
48141	48152	48125	48125	She	140	“ Whatever . I ’m not making any guarantees here . ”
48153	48162	48163	48163	I	0	“ I know . Anything you can get , ”
48166	48179	48163	48163	I	0	“ Anything . Every shred of info . I want it all . ”
48180	48186	48187	48187	She	140	“ Of course you do . ”
48195	48270	48187	48187	She	140	“ I ’m curious , too . This whole thing is weird . The discrepancy with the date , the fact the old versions of the ad are n’t present on any of the Wayback sites . Not that the caches are infallible , but come on . And I think it ’s weird that they do n’t have a site . If they ’re a real company , they should have a site . ”
48271	48276	48277	48277	She	140	“ You ’d think . ”
48284	48298	48277	48277	She	140	“ Come on , tell me . What ’s your interest in this ? ”
48299	48311	48312	48312	She	140	“ Having my answer without a lot of explanation , ideally . ”
48322	48331	48312	48312	She	140	“ I might not get anything at all . ”
48361	48364	48365	48365	she	140	“ Spill , ”
48368	48381	48365	48365	she	140	“ Maybe I do n’t like unanswered questions . Sorry to disappoint . ”
48382	48402	48340	48340	her	140	“ Oh you ’re hardly disappointing . I have n’t seen you in this good a mood in forever . ”
48403	48412	48365	48365	she	140	“ You think this is a good mood ? ”
48413	48419	48420	48420	She	140	“ For you it is . ”
48425	48431	48420	48420	She	140	“ You seem almost happy . ”
48432	48445	48446	48446	She	140	“ Must be all the baby goat videos I ’ve been watching . ”
48653	48662	48663	48663	Willow	140	“ What ’s up with the daffy look ? ”
48666	48671	48663	48663	Willow	140	“ Refresh it again . ”
48672	48682	48620	48620	She	140	“ Not until you tell me what ’s up . ”
48683	48700	48620	48620	She	140	“ I have this wake - up - call girl that I … have questions about . ”
48701	48704	48705	48705	she	140	“ Questions , ”
48716	48734	48705	48705	she	140	“ Yes , questions . And it ’s using up bandwidth I need for solving dehydrated Vossameer . ”
48750	48759	48760	48760	she	140	“ You get to have things for yourself , ”
48763	48767	48760	48760	she	140	“ I know . ”
48768	48793	48794	48794	I	0	“ Yeah , I do n’t think you do . You deserve to be happy even if you do n’t nail this new formula . ”
48807	48823	48801	48801	Willow	140	“ Fine . I ’m shutting up . Here ’s me shutting up , okay ? ”
48832	48843	48824	48824	She	140	“ I mean , they may not email back forever . ”
48844	48868	48869	48869	I	0	“ Judging from the correspondence so far , there ’s a better than fifty percent probability they reply in the first ten minutes , ”
48873	48880	48869	48869	I	0	“ Otherwise , some point today . ”
48881	48891	48824	48824	She	140	“ Is this something you ’ve worked out scientifically ? ”
48892	48897	48898	48898	I	0	“ Not that hard , ”
48907	48910	48901	48901	She	140	“ Nothing . ”
49021	49034	49035	49035	she	140	“ I ’m just saying , you ’re more than your innovations , ”
49045	49053	49054	49054	she	140	“ What if it ’s an address ? ”
49057	49064	49038	49038	I	0	“ Do you march down there ? ”
49065	49100	49038	49038	I	0	“ I ’ll know what to do when I see what you get . It would be stupid to decide how to act on information when I do n’t know what that information is . ”
49101	49106	49107	49107	she	140	“ Sorry , Sherlock , ”
49110	49121	49107	49107	she	140	“ I think of that approach as more Michael Faraday . ”
49126	49130	49131	49131	she	140	“ Four minutes , ”
49212	49215	49206	49206	She	140	“ Gotcha ! ”
49271	49277	49278	49278	She	140	“ Did you capture anything ? ”
49289	49292	49278	49278	She	140	“ Theo . ”
49297	49306	49307	49307	She	140	“ Do n’t jerk me around . What ? ”
49316	49326	49309	49309	her	140	“ The email is coming from inside the building . ”
49327	49332	49309	49309	her	140	“ Are you sure ? ”
49333	49347	49309	49309	her	140	“ Now you really do have to tell me what ’s going on . ”
49348	49358	49359	49359	I	0	“ I do n’t have to tell you dick . ”
49394	49468	49365	49365	her	140	“ It ’s one of your employees acting as a wake - up service . It seemed fishy to you because it is . Let me guess , you ’ve burned through every wake - up service out there trying to hold to that mad schedule of yours , and some desperate employee took it on herself to do it for you . I hope you did n’t abuse the person too much . ”
49469	49474	49475	49475	I	0	“ Not too much , ”
49530	49534	49535	49535	she	1087	“ Mystery solved , ”
49541	49563	49535	49535	she	1087	“ That ’s what ’s going on , right ? You could tell it was a fake thing because it is . ”
49570	49578	49535	49535	she	1087	“ So who ’s the unlucky caller ? ”
49579	49602	49603	49603	I	0	“ Probably Sasha Bale . In marketing . You ’ve never met her . Except the caller did n’t sound like her , ”
49607	49616	49603	49603	I	0	“ This caller has a more raspy voice . ”
49617	49635	49535	49535	she	1087	“ Yeah , there ’s an app for that . There ’s a dozen apps for that . ”
49636	49642	49603	49603	I	0	“ It was so realistic — ”
49643	49646	49647	49647	she	1087	“ App , ”
49650	49658	49647	49647	she	1087	“ But the way her voice would — ”
49659	49662	49603	49603	I	0	“ App . ”
49663	49666	49647	49647	she	1087	“ Damn . ”
49758	49767	49768	49768	I	0	“ I suppose she gets points for resourcefulness , ”
49771	49785	49768	49768	I	0	“ It ’s just that she does n’t seem like the type to … ”
49786	49804	49805	49805	I	0	“ To invent a wake - up - call service out of desperation for her demanding boss ? ”
49830	49857	49858	49858	Willow	140	“ She did seem flustered when I asked her about it . Like she had something to hide . I wondered about it at the time . ”
49861	49873	49858	49858	Willow	140	“ And then she writes that ad . After you ask . ”
50041	50047	50036	50036	Willow	140	“ I got ta go . ”
50071	50085	50066	50066	her	1087	“ Do n’t be too hard on her . She was probably desperate . ”
50846	50850	50832	50832	I	0	“ Mr. Drummond ? ”
50870	50878	50879	50879	She	100	“ Thank you for coming , Sasha . ”
50884	50888	50879	50879	She	100	“ My pleasure . ”
50909	50919	50893	50893	She	100	“ Are you eating ? Should we order first ? ”
50920	50933	50934	50934	She	100	“ I ’ll handle it . Do you know what you want ? ”
50942	50947	50934	50934	She	100	“ Are you eating ? ”
51019	51029	51014	51014	I	0	“ I ’m having the soup of the day . ”
51030	51044	51005	51005	she	140	“ Tomato basil . I was thinking about that . Make it two . ”
51045	51049	51083	51083	her	100	“ Any dessert ? ”
51050	51058	51059	51059	I	0	“ I ’ll see how I feel . ”
51201	51205	51206	51206	she	100	“ Thank you , ”
51209	51218	51206	51206	she	100	“ I did n’t know you came here . ”
51219	51226	51206	51206	she	100	“ I do n’t , typically . ”
51227	51245	51246	51246	she	100	“ The soup here is always delicious . And they have this rosemary bread that ’s incredible , ”
51259	51262	51249	51249	I	0	“ Excellent . ”
51325	51331	51332	51332	Sasha	100	“ People love a story , ”
51342	51421	51332	51332	Sasha	100	“ They love a little drama . They love to pull for the underdog , and this lets them in on that . We ’ve identified a few junior chemists who already run things for you who could log your daily progress — nothing proprietary , of course . We ’d get an image of the day — papers and beakers or whatever . Communications could tweak the write - ups to get them into layman ’s terms . ”
51457	51460	51461	51461	she	100	“ Yeah ? ”
51494	51497	51498	51498	She	100	“ Right ? ”
51505	51520	51498	51498	She	100	“ So this Instagram story , maybe we create a header or a name . ”
51559	51572	51573	51573	I	0	“ I like that it ’s about the process and the product , ”
51576	51585	51573	51573	I	0	“ That ’s what people should focus on . ”
51586	51589	51590	51590	She	100	“ Exactly . ”
51593	51609	51590	51590	She	100	“ But I guess that ’s not why you called me here , is it ? ”
51610	51621	51622	51622	I	0	“ I think you know why I called you here , ”
51646	51650	51651	51651	she	100	“ To brainstorm … ”
51656	51660	51661	51661	I	0	“ The calls , ”

51697	51701	51689	51689	She	100	“ Do I ? ”
51702	51740	51741	51741	She	100	“ Drop the act . They ’re amazing , and you know it , because you ’re the one making them . They ’re my favorite part of the day . Let ’s talk about the calls . ”
51765	51778	51753	51753	she	100	“ You ’re right . I think they ’re amazing , too . ”
51779	51792	51689	51689	She	100	“ So come out to dinner . You know you want to . ”
51799	51809	51810	51810	I	0	“ I get it , I ’m your boss , ”
51813	51876	51877	51877	She	100	“ If you do n’t want things with me to move that way , then I ’m fine to drop it here and now . But if your constant refusal to have dinner or to let me help you is because you think there might be some trouble at the company … look , I ’ll rewrite the corporate rules right now . ”
51882	51891	51877	51877	She	100	“ One dinner . See how it goes . ”
51904	51909	51901	51901	I	0	“ It is tempting . ”
51910	51913	51914	51914	I	0	“ So … ”
51925	51935	51922	51922	she	100	“ I knew you would … figure it out . ”
51941	51952	51936	51936	She	100	“ But just out of curiosity , how did you ? ”
51953	51967	51968	51968	Her	100	“ You corresponded with me as Hello Morning from inside the Vossameer building . ”
51972	51975	51968	51968	Her	100	“ Oops . ”
51976	51992	51993	51993	She	100	“ The way you sounded when you were making yourself come this morning … Sasha … ”
52018	52031	52014	52014	She	100	“ This place … I feel like we ’re in a fishbowl … ”
52032	52038	51993	51993	She	100	“ So come to dinner . ”
52039	52050	52051	52051	She	100	“ Hold on , I just felt my phone go . ”
52059	52070	52051	52051	She	100	“ Work meltdown . I absolutely have to handle this . ”
52071	52076	51993	51993	She	100	“ What is it ? ”
52077	52088	52089	52089	She	100	“ It ’s nothing that needs to be your problem . ”
52092	52099	52089	52089	She	100	“ A fire to put out . ”
52100	52103	52104	52104	I	0	“ Dinner , ”
52107	52114	52104	52104	I	0	“ Tonight . Does seven work ? ”
52118	52126	52115	52115	She	100	“ Am I crazy to say yes ? ”
52127	52130	52089	52089	She	100	“ Probably . ”
52131	52145	52146	52146	I	0	“ Fine . Let ’s do this ! Name the time and place . ”
52149	52165	52166	52166	She	100	“ I ’ll text you . You ’ll have to unblock me , of course . ”
52171	52184	52166	52166	She	100	“ You know what ? Email would be better . Way better . ”
52185	52194	52168	52168	her	100	“ You ’re not going to unblock me ? ”
52195	52202	52203	52203	She	100	“ It ’s a long story . ”
52216	52225	52203	52203	She	100	“ I really do wish I could stay . ”
52226	52232	52233	52233	I	0	“ I ’ll email you . ”
52512	52517	52518	52518	she	100	“ Take a seat , ”
52536	52551	52521	52521	I	0	“ Do you know why I ’ve called you in ? Can you guess ? ”
52557	52564	52565	52565	she	100	“ How about taking a guess , ”
52585	52602	52603	52603	I	0	“ The wake - up - call service . There is n’t one , is there ? ”
52620	52632	52613	52613	She	100	“ It ’s you . It ’s been you all along . ”
52655	52664	52665	52665	I	0	“ I can explain — I really can , ”
52720	52734	52735	52735	Sasha	100	“ Well , I wanted to tell you that I appreciate your ingenuity . ”
52748	52757	52735	52735	Sasha	100	“ You ’re not going to fire me ? ”
52758	52787	52788	52788	I	0	“ Of course not . Why would I ? Mr. Drummond appreciates the service . Most men would be paying ten bucks a minute for calls like that . ”
52803	52806	52799	52799	he	0	“ Uh … ”
52807	52840	52841	52841	She	100	“ You think I would n’t find out ? You impersonated a wake - up - call service that escalated to you masturbating and climaxing on the phone , with your boss … ”
52847	52856	52841	52841	She	100	“ With him telling you what to do . ”
52909	52921	52905	52905	I	0	“ I do n’t get it . I ’m not fired ? ”
52934	52952	52927	52927	She	100	“ Lizzie , I ’m sure you did n’t mean things to go that way . Right ? ”
52953	52958	52959	52959	I	0	“ Not at all ! ”
52962	52998	52927	52927	She	100	“ It was the furthest thing from my mind . When that Canadian place flaked out on me , I just wanted to replicate an effective service . I only wanted to keep my job . ”
52999	53003	53004	53004	She	100	“ Of course . ”
53010	53024	53004	53004	She	100	“ Though it did start out rather unorthodox , you have to admit . ”
53062	53065	53066	53066	she	100	“ Right ? ”
53069	53117	53066	53066	she	100	“ It was n’t supposed to be like that — I swear . I meant it to be boring and normal , but my roommate and I were goofing off , and when I said all those mean things , I did n’t know he was there . ”
53122	53130	53118	53118	Her	100	“ So what exactly did you say ? ”
53149	53157	53134	53134	he	101	“ I really did n’t mean it . ”
53158	53164	53165	53165	she	100	“ You ’re not fired , ”
53168	53181	53165	53165	she	100	“ But I should know how it started . Just in case . ”
53197	53230	53231	53231	She	100	“ Well … I said , ‘ wake up , motherfucker . ’ Something like that . ‘ People are waiting for whatever bullshit you have in store for them today . ’ ”
53235	53243	53231	53231	She	100	“ You said that to Mr. Drummond ? ”
53244	53284	53285	53285	She	100	“ I honestly did n’t know he was there . And … actually I think it might have been ‘ stupid asshole ’ that I called him . Jackalope . I do n’t know ; it all blends in . ”
53312	53323	53310	53310	Sasha	100	“ So I guess that ’ll wake a guy up . ”
53324	53330	53331	53331	I	0	“ I should think so ! ”
53341	53380	53331	53331	I	0	“ When I realized he was on the line , I thought for sure I ’d be fired . When he came down here and called it unorthodox , you could ’ve knocked me over with a feather . ”
53392	53399	53386	53386	she	100	“ You ’re really not mad ? ”
53403	53416	53400	53400	She	100	“ It ’s a little bit funny , you have to admit . ”
53433	53439	53440	53440	she	100	“ So he enjoyed that ? ”
53453	53521	53443	53443	I	0	“ I do n’t know that he enjoyed it . I do n’t know , maybe he was more … surprised . Maybe he ’s sick of everyone kissing his ass . I think his interest was more about curiosity . What kind of a wake - up caller says that ? That ’s why he did n’t fire the service . He ’s a puzzle guy . ”
53528	53547	53548	53548	I	0	“ Very true . Theo does not like a puzzle he ca n’t crack . So then what ? ”
53551	53558	53548	53548	I	0	“ It was just phone sex . ”
53602	53616	53586	53587	Mr. Drummond	101	“ One phone sex call is pretty much the same as the next . ”
53681	53687	53674	53674	She	117	“ So that ’s all ? ”
53700	53707	53674	53674	She	117	“ Yeah , that ’s all . ”
53708	53713	53714	53714	She	117	“ Okay , then . ”
53734	53759	53714	53714	She	117	“ I need somebody up in marketing . No … no … there ’s no problem , just an escort out of the building . ”
53798	53816	53795	53795	her	117	“ I ’m going to have to ask you to get your things and exit the building . ”
53817	53826	53886	53886	Sasha	138	“ You said I was n’t getting fired ! ”
53827	53855	53856	53856	I	0	“ You ca n’t be fired ; you ’re not a real employee yet . You ’re on probation , and that probationary period is now over . ”
53859	53879	53856	53856	I	0	“ Sasha , please . Tomorrow ’s the last day for me to get my bonus . One day . ”
53880	53885	53886	53886	Sasha	138	“ I ’m sorry . ”
53902	53918	53886	53886	Sasha	138	“ You were given an opportunity to do the most meaningful work of your life — ”
53919	53967	53886	53886	Sasha	138	“ I did do meaningful work ! Think of all the great work I did . The engagement numbers . The Instagram strategies . Please , I ’ll do anything . I ’ll work an extra week with no pay . I just need that bonus tomorrow . ”
53968	53999	53886	53886	Sasha	138	“ The bonus is for employees who do n’t commit fraud and pull the CEO into compromising situations . He could bring you up on charges of fraud and pandering . ”
54000	54011	53886	53886	Sasha	138	“ What ? No . It was n’t like that . ”
54016	54077	54012	54012	I	0	“ No ? Maybe it was all fun and games for you , but Mr. Drummond is angry and disgusted , and really , how could you blame him ? He does n’t want you calling him anymore . Not ever again . You contact him one more time and he really will look into pursuing further action against you . ”
54301	54309	54299	54299	Sasha	138	“ I want to see Mr. Drummond . ”
54327	54349	54350	54350	I	0	“ Mr. Drummond does n’t want to see you . Trust me . You do n’t want to push your luck . ”
54365	54374	54375	54375	I	0	“ Well , at least I ’m free , ”
54378	54405	54375	54375	I	0	“ This place sucks , and you know it . And if you do n’t , you need to pull your head out of your ass . ”
54406	54411	54412	54414	The security guy	1169	“ Let ’s go . ”
54420	54430	54412	54414	The security guy	1169	“ Do n’t worry , I know the way . ”
54614	54624	54625	54625	I	0	“ It ca n’t merely be a good place , ”
54629	54659	54625	54625	I	0	“ I want a great place . Something stylish , but not too fussy . She ’s the kind who ’d be into comfort food , but with flair . ”
54660	54663	54664	54664	Willow	140	“ Okay , ”
54667	54673	54664	54664	Willow	140	“ Comfort food with flair . ”
54674	54679	54680	54680	I	0	“ Stylish and fun , ”
54683	54739	54680	54680	I	0	“ It can be slightly quirky , but not all - out weird . Not quirky for quirky ’s sake . And the food has to be excellent . Taste - wise , but also in terms of how it looks . The plate has to look beautiful . And above all , elaborate desserts . ”
54740	54749	54750	54750	she	140	“ What have you done with my brother ? ”
54753	54761	54750	54750	she	140	“ Will you help me or not ? ”
54762	54769	54680	54680	I	0	“ You really enjoyed those calls . ”
54770	54779	54680	54680	I	0	“ Do I have to ask somebody else ? ”
54780	54805	54750	54750	she	140	“ No , I ’m sending you a link . The Blue Stag Club . But it ’ll be impossible to get a table … ”
54806	54809	54810	54810	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
54818	54822	54810	54810	I	0	“ Got it . ”
54952	54958	54997	54997	He	1184	“ Can I help you ? ”
54959	54967	54968	54968	I	0	“ I ’m hoping for dinner reservations , ”
54971	54989	54968	54968	I	0	“ Seven tonight . What do I have to do to get this table for seven tonight ? ”
54990	54996	54997	54997	He	1184	“ It ’s not possible . ”
55027	55030	55031	55031	he	1184	“ Really , ”
55034	55040	55031	55031	he	1184	“ We have a policy . ”
55468	55474	55475	55475	she	139	“ The jackalope has arrived ! ”
55506	55511	55512	55512	I	0	“ You look lovely , ”
55520	55528	55515	55515	She	139	“ So do you , Mr. Drummond . ”
55529	55537	55538	55538	She	139	“ I ’m back to Mr. Drummond ? ”
55547	55554	55555	55555	She	139	“ Oh , that whole thing … ”
55566	55575	55555	55555	She	139	“ I say we start from square one . ”
55590	55593	55587	55587	she	139	“ Ready ? ”
55594	55598	55599	55599	I	0	“ Sure am . ”
55636	55643	55619	55619	I	0	“ Have you heard of it ? ”
55644	55652	55653	55653	she	139	“ Heard of it ? Of course ! ”
55656	55666	55653	55653	she	139	“ I thought they were booked out for months . ”
55667	55688	55689	55689	She	139	“ They were . I did an in - person visit to get a table . I was … persuasive . ”
55694	55699	55689	55689	She	139	“ It ’s perfect . ”
55730	55733	55734	55734	she	139	“ Gorgeous , ”
55815	55823	55824	55824	I	0	“ You ’re so full of surprises , ”
55827	55833	55834	55834	She	139	“ What do you mean ? ”
55847	55857	55834	55834	She	139	“ I would n’t have guessed a dry martini . ”
55882	55886	55874	55874	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
55887	55895	55896	55896	She	139	“ I would ’ve guessed something sweeter . ”
55901	55906	55896	55896	She	139	“ Such an asshole . ”
55907	55911	55912	55912	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
55920	55925	55915	55915	She	139	“ You heard me . ”
56002	56020	56021	56021	She	139	“ Can I ask you , what made you call me like that in the first place ? ”
56025	56068	56021	56021	She	139	“ There actually was another service set up . A Canadian service . But I was so nervous they would n’t come through that I set up a call for myself for ten minutes before that . And they never came through . ”
56104	56141	56100	56100	I	0	“ I was so paranoid when I saw you next . I thought for sure you ’d fire me . You could ’ve knocked me over with a feather when you said the service was unorthodox ! ”
56173	56179	56165	56165	I	0	“ I ’m saving room . ”
56198	56203	56204	56204	I	0	“ Uh - oh , ”
56207	56211	56204	56204	I	0	“ User error ? ”
56212	56229	56184	56184	She	139	“ Just a little one . It would be a shame to ruin this beautiful jacket . ”
56230	56247	56248	56248	She	139	“ I had half a mind to wear my lab coat . Maybe I should ’ve . ”
56251	56265	56248	56248	She	139	“ To the Blue Stag ? Why on earth would you do that ? ”
56266	56274	56184	56184	She	139	“ I thought you might appreciate it . ”
56275	56283	56284	56284	She	139	“ Well , you know I do . ”
56318	56323	56324	56324	I	0	“ Talk to me , ”
56333	56339	56324	56324	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
56340	56371	56307	56307	she	139	“ This is me . We ’re here . Cards on the table . Are you feeling weird about this ? I want you to tell me if you are . ”
56372	56379	56380	56380	She	139	“ Why would you think that ? ”
56385	56403	56382	56382	her	139	“ I ’m happy we ’re out , finally . It ’s just all … so unusual . ”
56404	56408	56409	56409	I	0	“ It is , ”
56419	56456	56409	56409	I	0	“ The phone calls — that ’s not something I do every day . Or ever . And I want you to know , I ’m not expecting anything . We ’re just out for dinner . ”
56472	56478	56479	56479	she	139	“ It had to happen , ”
56482	56486	56479	56479	she	139	“ I mean … ”
56487	56496	56409	56409	I	0	“ Well , you were pretty against it . ”
56497	56503	56504	56504	She	139	“ Can you blame me ? ”
56516	56521	56504	56504	She	139	“ I suppose not . ”
56662	56673	56655	56655	I	0	“ What do you think about that situation over there ? ”
56674	56679	56715	56715	She	139	“ The dessert tray ? ”
56680	56684	56655	56655	I	0	“ Those cookies ? ”
56685	56689	56690	56690	She	139	“ Probably shortbread . ”
56693	56703	56690	56690	She	139	“ Meh . I ’m not a dessert person . ”
56723	56728	56729	56729	I	0	“ So tell me , ”
56732	56739	56729	56729	I	0	“ what ’s your favorite movie ? ”
56740	56750	56751	56751	My	0	“ Gone with the Wind . What ’s yours ? ”

56763	56766	56729	56729	I	0	“ Why ? ”
56767	56774	56729	56729	I	0	“ Just … need to know . ”
56775	56787	56729	56729	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I suppose I like Grease . ”
56792	56799	56800	56800	She	139	“ Grease is your favorite musical ? ”
56805	56812	56800	56800	She	139	“ You have something against Grease ? ”
56813	56819	56820	56820	She	139	“ You ’re not her . ”
56829	56850	56820	56820	She	139	“ I like all kinds of movies . What I like at any one time is dependent on my mood . ”
56859	56868	56851	56851	I	0	“ Why are you pretending to be her ? ”
56869	56884	56885	56885	I	0	“ What on earth are you talking about ? You think I ’m pretending ? ”
56891	56897	56885	56885	I	0	“ You ’re not her . ”
56905	56920	56921	56921	She	139	“ Why would you pretend ? Who is she ? I need to know . ”
56929	56960	56921	56921	She	139	“ Okay , fine . Cards on the table . I ’m worried about you . You invited a wake - up - call girl you never met to dinner . ”
56961	56997	56998	56998	She	139	“ And you impersonated her . Look , just give me her contact information — the real contact information — and we ’ll go back to how things were . No harm , no foul . ”
57031	57040	57026	57026	I	0	“ You ’re a beautiful , charming woman . ”

57049	57071	57046	57046	she	139	“ Why create the fake front in the first place ? Please tell me , is Operator Seven somebody you know ? ”
57091	57095	57096	57096	I	0	“ The information , ”
57099	57104	57096	57096	I	0	“ I want it . ”

57309	57330	57292	57292	I	0	“ It ’s not technically a firing when you ’re still on your probationary period . I learned that today . ”

57349	57353	57335	57335	She	117	“ What happened ? ”
57376	57409	57410	57410	She	117	“ I liked him . I trusted him . It felt so … real . But it was n’t . How did I not learn my lesson about trusting guys like that ? ”
57422	57440	57410	57410	She	117	“ Screw it . Trust is an act of bravery . So he can just fuck himself . ”
57441	57514	57410	57410	She	117	“ I felt brave around Mr. Drummond . I went places with him I never even went with Mason . But it was n’t really about that — it was like I had this feeling of discovery with him . Like Amelia Earhart , traveling through new territory . Except not alone . We were a team in a way I ca n’t explain . That ’s how it felt , anyway . ”
57515	57523	57524	57524	I	0	“ Amelia Earhart perished over the Pacific . ”
57532	57580	57524	57524	I	0	“ And I perished over Lexington Avenue . Because he takes what he wants . He warned me , even . He took and took and took , and then he did n’t even bother to fire me personally . What kind of an idiot am I ? ”
57581	57622	57410	57410	She	117	“ It ’s beautiful to trust . It ’s beautiful to open your heart . Do n’t let that asshole take that away . He ’s small and mean , and you ’re huge with your beautiful , amazing heart . ”
57623	57636	57410	57410	She	117	“ And in the end it ’s the least of my problems . ”
57637	57644	57645	57645	she	1227	“ Blow jobs for a buck ? ”

57682	57734	57410	57410	She	117	“ Um , being the cause of angry loan sharks about to invade our home when I do n’t have their money ? I have two days until thugs with pinky rings and guns come to collect money I do n’t have . I do n’t want you in the crossfire . ”
57735	57753	57667	57667	I	0	“ Crossfire ? What crossfire ? Do n’t tell me you ’ll be packing heat , too . ”
57754	57758	57759	57759	I	0	“ Not funny . ”
57765	57788	57789	57789	she	1228	“ If they think they ’re gon na clip you for that fourteen G ’s , they ’ve got another think coming , ”

57829	57853	57826	57826	she	1228	“ That was n’t a smile . I want you to start thinking about where you ’ll sleep while I deal with them . ”
57854	57869	57870	57870	she	1228	“ What do you mean , deal with them ? What does that mean ? ”
57877	57880	57870	57870	she	1228	“ Lizzie … ”
57881	57885	57886	57886	I	0	“ Not that , ”

57901	57921	57922	57922	Sasha	138	“ Mr. Drummond should pay . He ’s the one who got you fired . Make him help you . ”
57935	57967	57930	57930	He	138	“ I ’m the last person he ’d help . He ’s not who I thought he was . And I ’m serious . You need to crash somewhere Saturday night . ”
57976	58011	57930	57930	He	138	“ I ’m not leaving you . If you stay , I stay . Also , I totally have to see the kind of cookies you frost for it . They ’ll be epic . ”
58012	58028	57930	57930	He	138	“ You ’re not staying . If something happened to you , I ’d die . ”
58029	58042	58043	58043	She	1229	“ Goes both ways , sister . We ’re in this together . ”
58078	58081	58065	58065	She	1229	“ Want ? ”
58082	58090	58091	58091	She	1229	“ You are the best friend ever . ”
58116	58128	58091	58091	She	1229	“ So does this mean I have to take it down ? ”
58129	58132	58133	58133	She	1229	“ What ? ”
58191	58202	58203	58203	She	1229	“ Oh my god ! You have finally gone insane . ”
58210	58215	58203	58203	She	1229	“ It ’s stupid . ”

58371	58375	58376	58376	She	117	“ Like what ? ”
58379	58417	58418	58418	She	117	“ How many actresses does it take to screw in a light bulb ? One to screw it in and ninety - nine to stand there and say , ‘ it should be me up there ! ’ ”
58423	58430	58418	58418	She	117	“ Soooo funny . Fuck off . ”

59368	59385	59386	59386	Willow	140	“ Something else is going on . She would n’t just cut things off like that . ”
59389	59430	59386	59386	Willow	140	“ Yes , I know how that sounds , but you do n’t know her , and I do . If nothing else , I want to make sure things are okay . Did Sasha come down on her somehow ? ”
59431	59449	59450	59450	I	0	“ And there ’s the thing where you still want to go out to dinner with her . ”
59458	59473	59453	59453	Willow	140	“ Let me ask you this . How were you paying for this service ? ”
59474	59489	59386	59386	Willow	140	“ I already hit up accounting . They do n’t have the contact information . ”
59490	59499	59453	59453	Willow	140	“ Right , but how were you paying ? ”
59500	59503	59504	59504	She	140	“ PayPal . ”
59507	59516	59504	59504	She	140	“ I say we pay them , then . ”
59517	59520	59453	59453	Willow	140	“ Why ? ”
59521	59537	59538	59538	She	140	“ So we can follow the money . Assuming the PayPal account is still there . ”
59570	59579	59554	59554	Willow	140	“ We probably just paid Sasha thirty bucks . ”
59580	59610	59611	59611	We	1269	“ I know , but you have to look at everything . Sometimes when you do that and you look at your statement , you get a business name . ”

59765	59817	59818	59818	I	0	“ She tried to impersonate her , then refused to tell me . I ’ve been in business long enough to know when somebody can be bought . All Sasha ’s getting is a pink slip as soon as I figure out how to do it without HR up my ass . ”

59837	59859	59743	59743	I	0	“ Forget Sasha , I need the caller . We know the caller might work at Vossameer , but not necessarily . ”

I do n’t know if I should be insulted that you think I ’d actually do it , or that you think I ’m insane enough to pick this out for the occasion . It ’s not like I ’m whoring myself to the ladies of the Audrey Hepburn Appreciation Society . ”

And even if I go with elaborate fantasies of telling him off , he thinks he can get me to sit down to dinner . He thinks he can get me to kiss him . To sleep with him . Get me to the next step . He probably had me fired so he can make it all happen without fear of a lawsuit . This guy plays to win . ”

62319	62402	62003	62003	I	0	“ And arrogant . And ruthlessly efficient , which we knew about him . This is the man who does n’t even want his employees to be comforted by treats or decorations lest it detract from their efficiency . I mean , really ? Now I ’m going to sleep with you ? You think you ’re so hot and amazing with your lab coat and your bad - boy lips that I ’ll just sleep with you after you fire me ? ”

It ’s on me that I allowed it . I got lazy , I guess . Just wanted to believe a fairy tale . Anyway , he ’s the reason it crashed . He ’s down in the Caribbean or somewhere . With more money than I thought it was possible to squeeze out of me . ”

82539	82544	82545	82545	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
82556	82567	82548	82548	He	94	“ That would be out of the fuck buddies purview . ”
82568	82571	82572	82572	I	0	“ Theo , ”
82693	82703	82704	82704	he	94	“ The spot they went through is back there , ”
82708	82732	82704	82704	he	94	“ All this metal , and he managed to find the one loose part , the one damaged part , to blast through . ”
82765	82775	82759	82759	He	94	“ Screw it . Okay . Okay , then . ”
82776	82779	82780	82780	I	0	“ What ? ”
82788	82800	82783	82783	He	94	“ Take us down to the water once you ’re off . ”
82801	82805	82806	82806	Derek	171	“ Will do , ”
82809	82815	82806	82806	Derek	171	“ Down to the water ? ”
82824	82831	82832	82832	he	94	“ We ’ve come this far , ”
82922	82926	82927	82927	He	94	“ Come on . ”
83137	83150	83151	83151	He	94	“ I did n’t take you here to feel sorry for me . ”
83159	83163	83164	83164	I	0	“ I know , ”
83175	83203	83170	83170	He	94	“ See the third section ? And how the bridge is darker right down from it ? That ’s the repaired part . You can still tell . ”
83204	83213	83170	83170	He	94	“ Where they went off . The accident . ”
83221	83240	83241	83241	I	0	“ It was n’t so much an accident , really . Accidents are unexpected . This was inevitable . ”
83246	83256	83257	83257	he	94	“ You could see it coming from miles away , ”
83260	83343	83257	83257	he	94	“ My dad , the world ’s most high - functioning drunk . He kept a good job . Managed to handle his responsibilities , but could n’t resist driving . He just loved to drive us around . I do n’t know what the hell was in his head . It especially terrified Willow . She ’d cry when he ’d make her ride . He saw it as a criticism , and he ’d just do it all the more . ”
83386	83398	83399	83399	he	94	“ That ’s why Willow worked so hard for those scholarships , ”
83402	83477	83399	83399	he	94	“ I mean , she was in her bedroom programming from morning to night when other girls were doing whatever girls that age are supposed to do . It was her ticket out . The shit he ’d say . Those terrifying rides . Willow and I always hated rides at the fair . Roller coasters . That type of thrill was never fun for us . We had the real - life version . ”
83478	83482	83483	83483	I	0	“ Sounds like , ”
83509	83570	83505	83506	The others	1640	“ When I was fifteen , I started standing up to him and taking away the keys . I ’d refuse to ride . Refuse to let Mom ride . Sometimes hide the keys and just take what came . But he was still a lot bigger than me . I could sometimes stop the rides , but not always . ”
83607	83742	83743	83743	He	1642	“ At one point , Dad went out of town on a business trip , and it was just Mom and me . We were out of his orbit long enough that we felt what it was like to be free of his power . I had my mom talked into leaving . It was going to be just us . Build our own life . I had enough savings for a place in Queens . A sad little studio in a piece - of - shit building , but it would ’ve been ours . I really thought I had her on board , but then he came home , and nothing changed . Except the fights over the keys got worse . Finally I left . I managed to get a job . ”
83767	83782	83743	83743	He	1642	“ I was so damn angry . At him , but also at her . ”
83796	83843	83783	83783	He	1642	“ I glowered at her as I left , angry that she was too weak to come along . That was the last time I saw her . Because she was too weak to take the keys away from him herself . And I knew that . ”
83844	83847	83743	83743	He	1642	“ Theo — ”
83848	83869	83743	83743	He	1642	“ That was my role . Getting the keys . It was how I kept the three of us alive . ”
83870	83889	83743	83743	He	1642	“ Like it was your fault ? She was an adult . She could ’ve taken the keys . ”
83899	83927	83743	83743	He	1642	“ In theory , yes . In reality , she could n’t have taken them any more than she could ’ve pole - vaulted over the house . ”
83928	83937	83940	83940	he	1644	“ So you think it ’s your fault ? ”
83958	83963	83743	83743	He	1642	“ It was inevitable . ”
83964	83970	83971	83971	I	0	“ That is such shit ! ”
83974	83992	83971	83971	I	0	“ It was her job to take away the keys . To be watching out for you . ”
83993	83999	84000	84000	he	1644	“ In a perfect world , ”
84003	84008	84000	84000	he	1644	“ In this world . ”
84013	84023	84009	84009	He	1644	“ What does Willow say ? Surely she agrees . ”
84024	84058	83971	83971	I	0	“ She does n’t know . I mean , she knows they went off . She knows I left , but she ’s never thought it through in terms of cause and effect . ”
84059	84073	84074	84074	He	1644	“ Maybe because there is n’t any cause and effect that involves you . ”
84116	84123	84107	84107	I	0	“ You should tell your sister . ”
84124	84144	84107	84107	I	0	“ I ’m not going to tell my sister . Especially now . She has problems of her own . ”
84145	84161	84162	84162	He	1644	“ You ca n’t carry it like this . You need to talk about it . ”
84170	84180	84162	84162	He	1644	“ Is n’t that what fuck buddies are for ? ”
84181	84186	84107	84107	I	0	“ No , actually . ”
84245	84268	84238	84238	he	1644	“ They always tell that story like I ’m a hero . You can see now why I ’m not a fan . ”
84269	84274	84275	84275	I	0	“ God , Theo . ”
84310	84323	84324	84324	I	0	“ I ’m going to come back to your place with you , ”
84327	84336	84324	84324	I	0	“ And make you some nice hot cocoa . ”
84337	84346	84394	84394	His	1644	“ I do n’t want a pity visit . ”
84347	84360	84324	84324	I	0	“ It ’s not a pity visit . I just want to . ”
84385	84393	84394	84394	His	1644	“ You think you can stop me ? ”
84400	84403	84394	84394	His	1644	“ Yeah . ”
84404	84414	84415	84415	His	1644	“ You think you ’re the boss of me ? ”
84427	84436	84437	84437	he	1644	“ I do n’t have stuff for cocoa , ”
84441	84453	84437	84437	he	1644	“ I do . In my bag . From the caterers . ”
84473	84485	84459	84459	his	1644	“ You just want more of my savage and uncivilized loving . ”
84547	84552	84553	84553	I	0	“ Which is yours ? ”
84663	84672	84673	84673	I	0	“ Do just you despise dry - cleaning ? ”
84680	84695	84673	84673	I	0	“ It ’s a tux for a ridiculous banquet . I despise ridiculous banquets . ”
84696	84702	84673	84673	I	0	“ Too kumbayah for you ? ”
84703	84707	84673	84673	I	0	“ Pretty much . ”
84842	84862	84863	84863	He	1644	“ I ’ve never seen it from so high and near like this . The paths look even curvier . ”
84869	84885	84886	84886	he	1644	“ They made them like that so there would n’t be horse and carriage races , ”
84889	84896	84886	84886	he	1644	“ Does n’t slow the bikes . ”
84897	84900	84901	84901	he	1644	“ No , ”
84932	84941	84942	84942	I	0	“ You ca n’t blow off the banquet ? ”
84945	84965	84966	84966	He	1644	“ No . It ’s one of the hoops I have to jump through for the Locke Foundation partnership . ”
84983	85009	84966	84966	He	1644	“ They want to ensure that I ’m good in public . Not an asshole and all that . Apple pie and smiles for everyone . ”
85010	85023	85024	85024	He	1644	“ Oh , you are so apple pie and smiles for everyone . ”
85036	85046	85047	85047	he	1644	“ I can be when I have to be , ”
85053	85059	85047	85047	he	1644	“ When I want something . ”
85060	85069	85070	85070	He	1644	“ Because you always get what you want . ”
85125	85132	85133	85133	He	1644	“ What should we do now ? ”
85221	85231	85232	85232	I	0	“ Why do you even need Locke so bad ? ”
85243	85254	85255	85255	He	1644	“ You have wads of money and your own company . ”
85258	85273	85274	85274	he	1644	“ They have partnerships and trust built up with charitable organizations across the world , ”
85277	85307	85274	85274	he	1644	“ It ’s a lot less hassle to jump through their PR hoops than to set up my own network . Giving is actually more complicated than people think . ”
85308	85324	85370	85370	his	1644	“ Well , the Locke people should be grateful . That ’s what I think . ”
85325	85349	85370	85370	his	1644	“ They ’re into image . A strong image attracts the best people and makes them more effective . I can appreciate that . ”
85350	85359	85360	85360	I	0	“ You just do n’t want to bother , ”

85376	85391	85370	85370	his	1644	“ They ’d be especially grateful if I ’d worked out the new formula . ”
85392	85398	85399	85399	I	0	“ More gratitude , motherfuckers , ”
85413	85418	85402	85402	He	1644	“ Yeah , motherfuckers . ”
85470	85490	85491	85491	He	1644	“ This is my favorite freckle of yours . My second favorite is the one on your right thigh . ”

85664	85676	85677	85677	he	1644	“ Maybe it ’s time for you to change your mind , ”

85778	85818	85819	85819	He	1644	“ Your other one whorls perfectly , but this one refuses to whorl . It marches to its own drummer . It ’s something you do n’t see until you ’re really up close . A secret eyebrow rebellion . ”
85825	85833	85819	85819	He	1644	“ Do I need to quash it ? ”
85834	85837	85838	85838	I	0	“ Maybe , ”

85880	85890	85891	85891	I	0	“ You think you ’re the boss of everything , ”
86037	86051	86021	86021	He	1644	“ Everything always has to go perfectly your way . Is that it ? ”
86052	86055	86056	86056	I	0	“ Yes , ”
86066	86076	86077	86077	He	1644	“ What are you going to do about it ? ”
86083	86089	86077	86077	He	1644	“ I think you know . ”

88508	88514	88515	88515	Willow	140	“ I know , right ? ”
88520	88525	88526	88526	Lizzie	190	“ A ridiculous award ? ”

88797	88829	88792	88792	She	190	“ It ’s a huge honor . Even though I know you ’d rather get poked in the eye with a stick . Or have people sitting there flipping you off . ”
88830	88837	88792	88792	She	190	“ I would so prefer it . ”
88838	88843	88844	88844	I	0	“ You ’re terrible . ”

88954	88988	88989	88989	I	0	“ Come . It ’ll be a delicious dinner if nothing else — that ’s what everyone keeps telling me . They say Locke knows how to put out a damn fine spread . ”
88994	89015	88989	88989	I	0	“ There will probably be lavish desserts . And then you can sit in the audience and flip me off . ”

89190	89199	89200	89200	She	140	“ And an egg pan needs an entourage . ”
89206	89216	89200	89200	She	140	“ I ’m so sorry I ran her off . ”
89217	89224	89160	89160	Willow	140	“ She would ’ve gone anyway . ”

89314	89327	89160	89160	Willow	140	“ But you had her at your home . She seems so … ”
89328	89331	89332	89332	Willow	140	“ Perfect ? ”
89345	89348	89332	89332	Willow	140	“ Yeah . ”

90026	90037	90017	90017	Mia	117	“ You so need to do that before you leave . ”
90081	90094	90095	90095	I	0	“ We ’re not at that point in our fuck buddy relationship , ”
90156	90166	90167	90167	she	577	“ Yeah , fuck buddies . Whatever you say , ”

90277	90286	90287	90287	I	0	“ It ’s better for him , too , ”
90290	90314	90287	90287	I	0	“ He ’s been making great progress with his formula over the past week . He needs that mental bandwidth for his work . ”
90319	90322	90315	90315	She	117	“ What ? ”
90323	90336	90287	90287	I	0	“ It just seems … wrong . You two are good together . ”

90381	90397	90398	90398	I	0	“ They ’re both suit - wearing guys who are very into getting their way , ”

90458	90479	90452	90452	I	0	“ True , he does n’t try to influence me like Mason always would . Mason thought he knew everything . ”
90480	90491	90492	90492	Mia	117	“ And Theo , I ’m sorry , that dress ? ”
90495	90525	90492	90492	Mia	117	“ On his own , he bought you a gown you love , in your size . It ’s like , an Olympic gold medalist level of boyfriend achievement . ”

90608	90661	90605	90605	I	0	“ I was telling him the story about how I fell into the theme cookie niche , and I kept trying to shorten the story , because Mason would get bored with stories like that , but Theo was all , ‘ Wait , back up . I want every detail . ’ ”

90671	90678	90668	90668	Mia	117	“ He ’s fascinated with you . ”
90686	90711	90683	90683	I	0	“ And he never tells me what to do . He respects my instincts . In a weird way , I feel … admired . ”

90864	90867	90868	90868	she	117	“ Uh ! ”

91123	91132	91062	91062	She	117	“ It has to be so much money . ”
91133	91138	91139	91139	She	117	“ For comparative purposes . ”

93348	93401	93402	93402	He	138	“ I hired an executive coach , and we brainstormed finding somebody with people skills to complement my chemistry skills . Valerie , that ’s my coach , is all about the carrot over the stick . Or the gift basket , as it were . The microwave popcorn was my addition . ”

94168	94186	94187	94187	He	138	“ Because they did n’t know what was out there , only that it was something scary . ”

95753	95761	95746	95746	her	346	“ That better ? For my zinger ? ”
95767	95791	95792	95792	She	346	“ When impersonating me does n’t work , there ’s always petty jealousy , is n’t there ? It does n’t become you . ”
95799	95820	95792	95792	She	346	“ No ? Okay . But letting you know what an idiot you are ? That for sure becomes me . ”
