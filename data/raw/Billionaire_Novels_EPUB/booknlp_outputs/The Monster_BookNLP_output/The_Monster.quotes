I want his business , and nothing is going to stand in my way , least of all you . So stay the fuck away from me and do n’t give me those puppy eyes , begging to be fucked right there in front of your entire immediate family , like you are doing right now . You have no idea what you ’re asking for . Men like me eat girls like you for breakfast . And not in a pleasurable way . You got that ? ”
13856	13861	13862	13862	He	278	“ Yes . But … ”

20380	20386	20377	20377	he	278	“ That ’s some move . ”
20471	20477	20461	20461	He	278	“ Got anything against dicks ? ”

20564	20575	20576	20577	Silly girl	998	“ No , you ’re right , of course not . ”

20937	20942	20912	20912	I	0	“ What , what ? ”

21559	21564	21553	21553	he	278	“ Would it matter ? ”
21609	21616	21628	21628	My	0	“ Not in the fucking slightest . ”
21617	21627	21628	21628	My	0	“ Then I suggest you find out for yourself . ”
21722	21758	21713	21713	Sam	278	“ So fucking smug . If you want to be taken , you ’ll be taken the Sam Brennan way . No regrets . No repeats . And no fucking telling your parents , kiddo . ”
21915	21922	21923	21923	He	278	“ Not a virgin , then . ”
22217	22241	22189	22189	he	278	“ Well , well , little Aisling Fitzpatrick is all grown up , and she knows how to fuck like a porn star . ”
22356	22375	22348	22348	him	278	“ Your pussy might be used , but this asshole has never been fucked . I can tell . ”
22435	22459	22429	22429	his	278	“ You had to leave me a first to take , did n’t you , Aisling Fitzpatrick ? You poor , romantic soul . ”
22575	22580	22581	22581	I	0	“ I ’m coming , ”
22735	22755	22756	22756	I	0	“ Get the fuck up , ice princess . My grand vintage billiard table is not meant for sleep . ”
22803	22807	22808	22808	I	0	“ Ask nicely , ”
22829	22834	22808	22808	I	0	“ And I might . ”
22835	22858	22859	22859	Sam	278	“ I never do anything nicely . You should know by now . Where ’d you learn all your little bed tricks ? ”
22899	22905	22885	22885	He	278	“ You mean , fuck ? ”
22923	22974	22915	22915	I	0	“ Do n’t forget I spent seven years among people whose sole purpose in life was studying the human body . I had some pretty good time exploring all the ways to make a person scream in pleasure … and pain . You have n’t seen the half of it . ”
23160	23174	23175	23175	Sam	278	“ That ’s more than I wanted to know about you , kid , ”
23200	23214	23215	23215	He	278	“ What are you doing these days , anyway ? Pediatrician , right ? ”
23218	23229	23215	23215	He	278	“ OB - GYN . Brigham and Women ’s Hospital , ”
23260	23272	23273	23273	he	278	“ You really thought you could seduce me by dressing up ? ”
23279	23287	23288	23288	I	0	“ I did , did n’t I ? ”
23296	23312	23288	23288	I	0	“ Honestly ? I dressed like this to get in , not to seduce you . ”
23313	23322	23323	23323	His	278	“ Why did you want to get in ? ”
23331	23341	23323	23323	His	278	“ Because Badlands is the hottest place in Boston . ”
23342	23354	23355	23355	he	278	“ You do n’t care about the hottest places in Boston , ”
23359	23365	23355	23355	he	278	“ Of course I do , ”
23383	23393	23373	23373	he	278	“ Sometimes even good girls want to be bad . ”
23394	23409	23410	23410	he	278	“ Which is why you were banned from this establishment in the first place , ”
23413	23418	23410	23410	he	278	“ That ’s unfair . ”
23419	23446	23373	23373	he	278	“ Fair and I do n’t even share the same fucking planet . Which part of my character made you think I care about being fair ? ”
23500	23536	23537	23537	I	0	“ I ’m banned from your establishment because you know if I get too close , you ’d actually have to pay attention to me , and every time we ’re together , magic happens , ”
23581	23614	23571	23571	his	278	“ The only magic we shared today was that I made your asshole about an inch wider for life . Regardless of that , you pulled a dirty move , Miss Fitzpatrick . ”
23615	23633	23634	23634	I	0	“ We monsters do what we have to do . You know that better than I do . ”
23637	23643	23644	23644	he	278	“ You ’re no monster , ”
23647	23658	23644	23644	he	278	“ You have no idea who or what I am . ”
23659	23668	23669	23669	he	278	“ What was your objective ? One fuck ? ”
23672	23687	23669	23669	he	278	“ One ? No . A few ? Sure , depending on your attitude , ”
23749	23752	23753	23753	he	278	“ Aisling , ”
23786	23867	23771	23771	I	0	“ If we fuck — and that ’s an if , not a when — that ’s all we ’ll be doing . Every single thing you were born and bred to achieve — a respectable husband , children , a family , a Labrador to complete your Christmas photo — I rejected before you were even born . It will be just that . Fucking . And no one could ever know about our arrangement , for obvious reasons . ”
24065	24073	24074	24074	I	0	“ What do you have in mind ? ”
24103	24152	24090	24090	Sam	278	“ Well , we ca n’t fuck around in your place since you still live with your parents — what the hell is that all about , anyway?—and I never let anyone into my apartment , so I guess you can meet me here tomorrow . Same time . ”
24153	24158	24159	24159	I	0	“ Why not there ? ”
24163	24166	24159	24159	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
24180	24191	24167	24167	He	278	“ Why do n’t you let anyone into your apartment ? ”
24192	24198	24199	24199	he	278	“ Because I hate everyone , ”
24220	24226	24199	24199	he	278	“ Why the fuck else ? ”
24227	24238	24199	24199	he	278	“ So no one ’s ever been in your apartment ? ”
24239	24268	24269	24269	He	278	“ My parents visited once or twice . Sailor knows the address but is not allowed to come there . Why do you still live with your parents ? ”
24287	24307	24278	24278	I	0	“ I do n’t see the point of paying for a place when I basically live at the hospital . ”
24308	24353	24354	24354	he	278	“ Do n’t act like living in your own apartment would require you to wash a mug . You ’re too rich to do shit yourself , and you and I both know that . Why are you still hiding behind Mommy and Daddy ? ”
24420	24432	24433	24433	I	0	“ Does that mean I ’m no longer banned from Badlands ? ”
24436	24490	24433	24433	I	0	“ Oh , you ’re still banned , missy . I do n’t want to see you partying with these losers . One of the bouncers will show you through the back door when you get here tomorrow , but you ’re not allowed at the bar or any of the card rooms . ”
24491	24498	24505	24505	his	1046	“ See you tomorrow , Monster . ”
24499	24502	24503	24503	he	1046	“ Nix , ”
24655	24703	24638	24639	Catalina Greystone	127	“ Just thought y’ all should know . What with the fact that they ’re gon na knock the whole thang down next week . Not that the property ’s worth a dime , mind you . But I thought , why not let her son know ? ”
24796	24804	24805	24805	I	0	“ How ’d you get my number ? ”
24822	24833	24805	24805	I	0	“ Your daddy gave it to me . Troy somethin’ . ”
24862	24888	24846	24846	he	123	“ Well , I appreciate the heads - up , but I ca n’t imagine there ’s anything in this house of value to me . ”
25186	25198	25199	25204	The woman on the other line	1062	“ Are n’t you gon na ask how she passed away ? ”
25259	25276	25277	25277	he	212	“ Air bike and ropes next . You ’ve got sixty seconds to recover , Monster , ”
25310	25317	25327	25327	her	1066	“ Hello ? You still there ? ”
25341	25397	25332	25332	I	0	“ Listen , Mrs. Masterson , I appreciate your motherly concern , but to say Cat and I were n’t close would be the understatement of the fucking century . There ’s nothing I need from her place . I ’m a busy man . I do n’t have time to go down to Georgia . ”
25626	25641	25642	25643	Mrs. Masterson	211	“ Drugs . She had an overdose . That ’s how she passed away , ”
25656	25754	25642	25643	Mrs. Masterson	211	“ Poor thang . Girl Scouts found her . Came to try to sell her some cookies . Would you believe ? They looked through the window . Saw her lying on the floor and called 9 - 1 - 1 . Poor children . No one ought to see somethin’ like that , let alone kiddies . They say she ’d been like that for days . Maybe a week . No one came to check on her . Her phone log said no one even called . She was a lonely woman , your mother . ”
25811	25825	25826	25832	the old woman on the other line	1073	“ Look , I know you two were n’t exactly thick as thieves … ”
25834	25845	25826	25832	the old woman on the other line	1073	“ … still , son , you should be here . ”
25846	25851	25826	25832	the old woman on the other line	1073	“ I ’m not — ”
25852	25876	25877	25877	she	1073	“ Boy , I do n’t know how to be clearer than I am . There ’s something of hers you should see , ”
25883	25962	25877	25877	she	1073	“ Let ’s leave it at that , shall we ? She told me you were a rich man . That means you can afford to take the time off work and get your ass down here , mister . I know I ’m old , but I ai n’t stupid . I do n’t mean you should come here to pick up some Walmart china or family albums . There are some things you need to see . ”
25972	25976	25967	25967	her	1073	“ Like what ? ”
25977	25984	26018	26018	her	1073	“ I ai n’t tellin ’ . ”
25985	26002	26018	26018	her	1073	“ You ’re an infuriating woman , Mrs. Masterson . Has anyone ever told you that ? ”
26003	26009	26010	26010	She	1073	“ All the damn time . ”
26028	26039	26020	26020	she	1073	“ So , is that a yes , little Greystone ? ”
26040	26043	26044	26044	I	0	“ Brennan , ”

26208	26214	26215	26215	I	0	“ Smart move , boy . ”
26238	26273	26231	26231	him	1076	“ There ’s actually a flight going out of Boston Logan Airport in a few hours . Better catch that one , ’cause there ’s thunderstorms rolling in tomorrow and there could be delays . ”
26274	26278	26279	26279	I	0	“ Book it , ”
26539	26542	26543	26543	He	212	“ Ready ? ”

27099	27117	27131	27131	she	122	“ Sparrow . I ’m at Cat ’s place in Georgia . She died of an overdose . ”
27118	27122	27123	27123	she	122	“ Troy said , ”
27145	27166	27141	27141	I	0	“ I think there ’s something here I should see , but I ’m not sure where to find it . ”
27228	27250	27225	27225	she	122	“ Check the nightstand drawers or the little nooks in her closet . That ’s where women usually stash their secrets . ”
27251	27261	27225	27225	she	122	“ Done , and also duly noted . Nothing . ”
27262	27270	27225	27225	she	122	“ Ripped the carpets and floor up ? ”
27271	27277	27278	27278	I	0	“ Every inch of them , ”
27296	27301	27278	27278	I	0	“ Any other ideas ? ”
27302	27310	27311	27311	I	0	“ Are there any pictures hanging there ? ”

27434	27444	27429	27429	Sparrow	122	“ This is why I do n’t trust women . ”
27445	27463	27464	27464	she	122	“ That ’s okay . We do n’t trust men right back . Oh and , Sam ? ”
27475	27478	27479	27479	I	0	“ Mmm ? ”
27515	27578	27508	27508	me	0	“ I ’m sorry for your loss . And I know you do n’t see it as a loss , I do , but I can not find joy in knowing the woman who created you has passed away . Because at the end of the day — she gave me you . And I love you so very much , son . ”
30148	30163	30131	30132	Grandma Maria	126	“ Call an ambulance . I have to get to the hospital . Now . ”

30970	31006	31007	31007	I	0	“ You know , Cat , I thought about killing you often enough . Every other month , maybe . There is something poetic in taking a life from the person who gave you one , ”
31030	31125	31126	31126	I	0	“ But then it all boiled down to the same thing : killing a person is taking a risk . You were never worth the risk . That ’s your life story in a nutshell , is n’t it , Catalina ? Never more than an afterthought . So many lovers , and fake friends , and fiancés , and even a husband , yet no one has ever visited your grave . Only an eighty - five - year - old neighbor who would find Stalin lovable . I guess it ’s goodbye . ”
31167	31177	31178	31178	Troy	123	“ Do not let this spin out of control , ”

32089	32100	32101	32101	I	0	“ Not as happy as I ’d like to be . ”
32120	32170	32101	32101	I	0	“ Which brings us to the next topic . I caught the Russians smuggling a hundred and thirty pounds of hashish into one of their delis . Whatever Vasily Mikhailov sold — and it was not fucking pastrami — he did n’t hand over a cut from the earnings . ”
32225	32253	32222	32222	Troy	123	“ Do n’t get me started about the Russians . You had no business taking over their territory in the first place . Back to Gerald Fitzpatrick . ”
32267	32287	32254	32254	He	123	“ I want you to sit on this information until we confirm it . I know it looks bad — ”
32288	32293	32294	32294	I	0	“ It ’s airtight , ”
32298	32306	32294	32294	I	0	“ I have proof . Hard facts . ”
32378	32382	32383	32383	he	715	“ And still … ”
32392	32457	32383	32383	he	715	“ … you know something he thinks you do n’t know . You have the upper hand now . Operate within the scope of your role , but do n’t turn this into the Red fucking Wedding . I know you , Sam . You enjoy delivering slow deaths much more than fast killings . Torture him , but do n’t finish him completely . ”
32547	32550	32551	32551	I	0	“ Fine , ”
32561	32580	32551	32551	I	0	“ I suppose I could torture him a little . But I will go for the throat eventually . ”
32581	32613	32614	32614	Troy	123	“ Eventually is still at least a few months away , and I hope I can stumble across some information that will make you change your mind between now and then . ”
32759	32763	32764	32764	He	123	“ You good ? ”
32779	32788	32774	32774	I	0	“ Why the fuck would n’t I be ? ”
32789	32792	32764	32764	He	123	“ Cat — ”
32793	32852	32857	32857	His	123	“ Was , like her namesake , just another pussy . I do n’t consider her death an event worth mentioning . The awful apple pie I had to endure from her nagging neighbor next door caused me more discomfort than knowing she had been left to rot in her apartment for a week before people found out . ”
32853	32856	32857	32857	His	123	“ Arright … ”
32871	32895	32857	32857	His	123	“ Do n’t get too wild with your revenge plot against Gerald , ah ? Remember , the matter is still under investigation . ”
32934	32937	32938	32938	I	0	“ Sure . ”
32972	33006	33007	33007	I	0	“ The tests came back , Mrs. Martinez , and I thought we could go through them together and talk about what they mean for you and what I recommend you do next . ”
33081	33093	33094	33094	I	0	“ Well . Okay . Let ’s see , shall we ? ”
33114	33135	33136	33136	I	0	“ What do we have here ? It says here that … oh , excuse me . Just one moment . ”
33251	33268	33288	33288	Clover	226	“ Quick , there was an explosion in one of our refineries , Da ’s fault . ”
33319	33330	33315	33315	Hunter	155	“ I have to take this . I ’m sorry . ”
33367	33380	33359	33359	Hunter	155	“ Ash . You have to come home . It ’s Da . ”
33381	33390	33391	33391	I	0	“ Is he okay ? Is he hurt ? ”
33426	33481	33482	33482	He	155	“ Physically ? He is fine . For now , anyway . There ’s no way of knowing what Mom is gon na do to his ass in the next few hours . Listen , Ash , there ’s a scandal . Someone leaked some photos and text messages of Da with … uh … ”
33520	33560	33561	33561	I	0	“ Just spit it out , Hunt . I know Mom and Dad are n’t giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money . I ’ve lived under their roof my whole life , for goodness ’ sake . ”
33577	33583	33561	33561	I	0	“ What ’d he do ? ”
33584	33591	33592	33592	he	155	“ It ’s a sex scandal , ”
33596	33636	33592	33592	he	155	“ Not shocking , I know , but this time there are some pretty graphic pictures on the internet . Da called me as soon as they surfaced . Devon is working to take them down as we speak . ”
33702	33705	33706	33706	I	0	“ Wow . ”
33754	33760	33761	33761	I	0	“ That ’s … ironic , ”
33767	33771	33772	33772	Hunter	155	“ Ya think ? ”
33922	33931	33932	33932	I	0	“ Where are you ? How is Mother ? ”
33963	33995	33996	33996	Hunter	155	“ I ’m just getting into Avebury Court right now . Sail and the kids are with me . Cillian , Persy , and Sam are already there . Mom is … ”
34003	34037	33996	33996	Hunter	155	“ I do n’t know how she is , Ash . She has n’t picked up the phone . Hurry . You ’re the only one who could ever get through to her . ”
34051	34058	34047	34047	I	0	“ All right , love you . ”
34059	34067	34071	34071	he	155	“ Love you , too , sis . ”
34891	34920	34928	34928	he	1363	“ Sorry , love , but Boss is on more important business than a casual fuck . Guess your two minutes of being Brennan ’s mistress are up , ”
35046	35057	35058	35058	Mother	169	“ No one asked you to be faithful , Gerald ! ”
35069	35121	35060	35060	her	169	“ That would be too much for you , would n’t it , dear ? But why could n’t you be discreet about it ? How much do you think I can tolerate ? I am a walking , talking joke ! Look at these pictures . Just look at them ! ”
35199	35228	35229	35229	Mother	169	“ To make matters worse , she is twenty - five ! Younger than your own daughter . What were you thinking ? Aisling , there you are ! ”
35249	35279	35238	35238	she	169	“ Be a darling and ask someone to give me my special tea with honey and ginger and see to it that my hot bath will be ready soon . ”
35329	35335	35336	35336	I	0	“ Of course , Mother . ”
35414	35426	35427	35427	Cillian	154	“ Enough . Who do you think could ’ve leaked this ? ”
35430	35480	35427	35427	Cillian	154	“ It ’s not the woman in the pictures . She is married now , with a child on the way , and is horrified by this coming out . Hunter spoke to her earlier . She claims someone hacked into her old phone and stole the images illegally . ”
35481	35497	35498	35498	Hunter	155	“ And by her hiccups and hysterical crying , she said the truth , too , ”
35507	35533	35498	35498	Hunter	155	“ I ’ll bet ! I never would ’ve given her the time of the day otherwise ! I ’ve been careful . I swear . ”
35548	35567	35534	35534	Athair	179	“ This is a setup . You know I ’d never do you wrong , Jane my dear . ”
35656	35660	35661	35661	Cillian	154	“ Shut up , ”
35671	35680	35661	35661	Cillian	154	“ Any idea who could have done this ? ”
35681	35710	35711	35711	Hunter	155	“ If we start counting our enemies , we wo n’t leave here until next year , and we have a vacation booked in the Maldives next summer . ”
35721	35729	35711	35711	Hunter	155	“ I ’ll take care of this . ”
35750	35770	35771	35771	He	278	“ Come on , Gerry . Let ’s get to the bottom of this mess . Privacy , please . ”
35788	35794	35773	35773	his	278	“ Jane , you too . ”
35826	35841	35808	35808	I	0	“ It ’s not fair ! I want to know what they are saying . ”
35865	35900	35851	35851	I	0	“ Oh , Aisling , be a darling and go eavesdrop on them . You know I ’m no good at not being seen . You can slip in undetected , I am sure . ”
35901	35904	35905	35905	I	0	“ Mother , ”
35917	35925	35905	35905	I	0	“ Brennan wanted them to have privacy . ”
35926	35941	35942	35942	She	169	“ Brennan is a brute and a beast . Who cares what he wants ? ”
36061	36092	36093	36093	Sam	278	“ Let ’s take it a step back . Tell me about your former lovers , any potential bastard children who might be lurking around looking for a nice check . ”
36107	36138	36093	36093	Sam	278	“ Jesus Christ , Brennan , talk about a loaded question . Well , in the last decade , I had Bonnie , Sheila , Christie , Ulrika , Ruthie — ”
36139	36154	36155	36155	Sam	278	“ Start with the first year of your marriage and move your way up , ”
36161	36168	36155	36155	Sam	278	“ We need to be thorough . ”
36169	36175	36176	36177	my father	3933	“ That could take days ! ”
36273	36276	36277	36277	Sam	278	“ Days , ”
36308	36411	36297	36297	he	3933	“ Fucking charming . Let ’s try to narrow it down . Think of someone with the potential to seek revenge . Anyone you knocked up ? Someone you might have hurt personally ? Those would be the people most likely to dig through the dirt and harm you . No one wants to come out as the mistress , but people will have no qualms compromising someone else to take you down . It ’s possible one of your other mistresses hacked into your latest one ’s cloud to shed light as to what she considers foul play on your end . ”
36412	36420	36421	36421	Da	171	“ I do n’t do foul play , ”
36436	36454	36421	36421	Da	171	“ I take care of my mistresses and provide them with money and jewelry and expensive cars . ”
36493	36539	36483	36483	he	607	“ I ’m sure you make them feel like fucking rock stars , Gerry . But accidents happen , and you ’re a virile man . Any chance you have any bastards lying around ? Maybe women who had to get hush - hush abortions ? ”
36565	36594	36595	36595	I	0	“ No . No bastard children . And I ’m not that virile . As you are well aware , not all of my children are biologically mine . ”
36651	36664	36665	36665	Sam	278	“ You ’re not really giving me much to work with here , ”
36747	36798	36743	36743	Troy	123	“ Make me a fucking list , Gerry . Of every single woman you stuck your dick into . If I ca n’t be thorough , I ca n’t be helpful . No use in paying me a small fortune for sitting around and babysitting your two fully grown sons . ”
36799	36812	36816	36816	him	3933	“ I ’m also paying you to keep away from my daughter , ”
36829	36832	36833	36833	Sam	278	“ Yeah . ”
36836	36846	36847	36847	He	278	“ Some challenge that is . Make the list . ”
36909	36912	36904	36904	Sam	278	“ Ow . ”
36995	37010	36978	36978	his	278	“ If it is n’t my favorite tight hole . Been eavesdropping , Nix ? ”
37118	37146	37089	37089	she	1430	“ It ’s my house , Brennan . I can do whatever I want , including , but not limited to , spending time in my sunroom . ”
37147	37194	37196	37196	he	1436	“ You are many things , Aisling , including the daughter of two of the most pathetic creatures I ’ve ever encountered and a champagne socialist , but you are no idiot . So do n’t act like one . What were you doing in there ? ”
37242	37247	37248	37248	I	0	“ Admiring the plants . ”
37252	37255	37248	37248	I	0	“ Bullshit . ”
37256	37260	37261	37261	He	1436	“ Prove it . ”
37273	37288	37261	37261	He	1436	“ Well , then . Nice talk , Brennan . Are you done now ? ”
37306	37310	37311	37311	he	1436	“ Not quite , ”
37339	37356	37311	37311	he	1436	“ I ’m glad I caught you here . I have an update about our situation . ”
37357	37361	37362	37362	I	0	“ Our situation ? ”
37367	37372	37373	37373	he	1436	“ Our fucking arrangement , ”
37387	37430	37373	37373	he	1436	“ It ’s canceled . I ’m not interested anymore . You were a great sport . Five out of five stars . Would highly recommend . Unfortunately , I have some pressing issues right now and no time for complicated pussy . ”
37552	37598	37599	37599	I	0	“ We had plans together ? Sorry , I do n’t recall . Either way , thanks for giving me an update about a date I had no plan attending . Now , do n’t you have to go do some work for my father ? ”
37628	37633	37634	37634	I	0	“ Chop chop now ! ”
37645	37691	37634	37634	I	0	“ As you pointed out earlier , my father pays you a small fortune , and not for your intellectual skills — which , by the way , I find lacking . Let us know when you have more information for us about the leaker . ”
37813	37837	37838	37838	Mother	169	“ Oh , Aisling , I wo n’t be able to sleep at all tonight . Mind stroking my hair until I do ? ”
37874	37880	37881	37881	I	0	“ Yes . Of course . ”
38713	38719	38720	38720	I	0	“ How bad is it ? ”
38729	38732	38733	38733	Becker	245	“ Bad , ”
38756	38764	38733	38733	Becker	245	“ I think they got my lungs . ”
38765	38773	38774	38774	Angus	246	“ Pretty sure I broke my arm , ”
38916	38920	38921	38921	I	0	“ Get up . ”

39296	39347	39292	39292	I	0	“ Next time , have the stones to tell me directly when you take an unauthorized vacation . Now give me your cousin ’s address . I ’ve got two injured soldiers I would very much like to keep alive because they owe me three weeks ’ pay of work . ”

39506	39518	39519	39519	he	248	“ It was poor planning on my behalf . I agree , ”
39539	39556	39557	39558	Dr. Holmberg	248	“ Surely you know someone who works in the medical field who can help you out ? ”
39679	39718	39671	39671	they	1516	“ You ’d be surprised , Holmberg , but I do n’t know many doctors . Or fucking astronauts , for that matter . My line of work is killing people , not nursing them back to health . ”
40039	40044	40045	40046	Dr. Holmberg	248	“ Perhaps you could — ”
40082	40095	40096	40096	Sailor	130	“ Does that mean you are finally going to ask her out ? ”

40367	40382	40364	40364	I	0	“ Oh , really ? So what ’s the thing beating in your chest ? ”
40383	40397	40398	40398	She	130	“ It ’s not beating . It ’s ticking . Probably a bomb . ”
40402	40424	40398	40398	She	130	“ Do n’t be too harsh with Ash . You know she is a gentle one . Love you , asshole . ”

40587	40630	40580	40580	I	0	“ I have two injured soldiers . I ca n’t drop them at the hospital for obvious reasons . If I bring them over to Badlands , could you get a triage kit and treat them ? You ’ll be paid handsomely . ”
40683	40689	40690	40690	she	1559	“ What are their injuries ? ”
40697	40723	40690	40690	she	1559	“ Give me the physical description , please , not your medical assessment , unless of course you went to med school without my knowledge . ”

40787	40794	40806	40806	She	1559	“ Where about in the chest ? ”
40795	40805	40806	40806	She	1559	“ Lungs . Meet me at Badlands in thirty . ”
40944	40947	40948	40948	she	115	“ No , ”

41519	41557	41507	41507	She	115	“ I ’m going to start with this one , since he needs urgent medical attention . Make yourself useful for a change and help me set him up on the table , will you , Sam ? ”
41707	41715	41716	41716	I	0	“ What the hell is this place ? ”
41746	41769	41770	41770	she	1596	“ A friend of mine owns it . He treats people without insurance here . People who can not afford urgent care , ”

41826	41880	41820	41820	her	1596	“ I ’ve seen you shoot someone in the head and you are here so I can patch up your hitmen . Oh , the hypocrisy . Dare I say , Sam , this is so deliciously rich I think your statement alone should be in a higher tax bracket than my family . ”
41881	41890	41783	41783	she	1596	“ You and I are not the same . ”

42162	42182	42235	42235	she	1596	“ Allow me to correct my statement — I do n’t care if you mind . I ’m staying . ”

42227	42234	42235	42235	she	1596	“ Do n’t be so sure , ”
42256	42263	42235	42235	she	1596	“ Your Hippocratic Oath , then . ”

42337	42340	42328	42328	she	1596	“ About ? ”
42341	42351	42328	42328	she	1596	“ My father and the media circus around him . ”

42422	42431	42438	42438	she	1596	“ A bit slow , are n’t you ? ”
42480	42491	42456	42456	She	1596	“ You got a problem , speak to my manager . ”
42492	42499	42500	42500	she	1596	“ You are your own manager , ”
42504	42509	42500	42500	she	1596	“ That ’s right … ”
42514	42535	42510	42510	I	0	“ … and I do n’t care what you think about my services , so tough fucking luck , Nix . ”
42536	42540	42541	42541	she	1596	“ So taciturn , ”
42574	42583	42541	42541	she	1596	“ Almost like you have something to hide . ”
42584	42611	42612	42612	I	0	“ Looks to me like you ’re the one with the juicy secrets . Tell me about this friend of yours who is operating this place . ”

42780	42809	42810	42810	She	1615	“ I ’d like to see you try . Now please help me return Dumb to the reception , and fetch me Dumber . Go on , now . ”
43055	43062	43063	43063	I	0	“ What do I owe you ? ”
43076	43094	43095	43095	She	1615	“ Nine grand , plus supplies , so let ’s round it to eleven . Cash only . ”
43141	43147	43136	43136	I	0	“ You ’re kidding me . ”
43148	43180	43181	43181	Ash	156	“ Heavens , Brennan . I ’m a highborn woman . I lack anything resembling a good sense of humor . Goes against everything I ’ve been taught in Catholic school , ”
43185	43202	43181	43181	Ash	156	“ Do you think it would be less pricey if you took them to the hospital ? ”
43203	43228	43229	43229	She	1626	“ I think if I took them to the hospital , they would n’t have been treated in some frat boy ’s fucking basement . ”
43276	43324	43325	43327	The little shi	1629	“ They ’re alive and well . Same result as you ’d get at the hospital . I ’m sorry , I assumed you ’d have this kind of money handy . Would you like me to let you know about our payment options , Mr. Brennan ? ”
43367	43376	43349	43349	I	0	“ What are you playing at , Nix ? ”
43377	43380	43381	43381	Her	1626	“ Nothing . ”
43412	43429	43408	43408	you	1632	“ You asked for my services . I assumed you were prepared to pay for them . ”

43490	43514	43515	43515	Ash	156	“ Neither do you . So pay up . I ’ll be seeing you at Thanksgiving dinner . You can pay me then . ”
43610	43617	43618	43618	Nix	210	“ Now if you excuse me … ”
43689	43695	43696	43696	I	0	“ How about a kiss ? ”
43820	43831	43832	43832	I	0	“ Would a kiss be a sufficient form of payment ? ”
44035	44042	44043	44043	she	115	“ You taste like an ashtray , ”
44068	44087	44058	44058	she	115	“ Maybe so , but you taste like an easy lay , my least favorite flavor of woman . ”
44203	44209	44188	44188	I	0	“ Now we ’re even . ”
44236	44260	44261	44261	she	115	“ Oh , you thought a kiss would be your payment as opposed to the eleven grand you owe me ? Oh my … ”
44277	44364	44261	44261	she	115	“ … my apologies , Mr. Brennan . I do n’t accept sexual favors as payment . That would be my father ’s specialty , and I very much doubt he ’d be interested in what you have to offer . I would still like the money at Thanksgiving . What ’s the common interest your loan sharks use ? Forty - five percent ? That suits me . Now , have a good rest of the day , Mr. Brennan , and do take care . ”

45676	45712	45713	45713	She	1685	“ I ’m great . You looked thoughtful through the window . Which was why I bypassed the usual hugs and kisses routine to see how you were doing . Your mother looks … preoccupied . ”
45786	45791	45792	45792	I	0	“ Where ’s Cillian ? ”
45808	45826	45798	45798	Astor	236	“ With Gerald in his office . I ca n’t believe he did that to your mom . ”
45863	45867	45868	45868	I	0	“ I can . ”
45883	45893	45894	45894	Persephone	176	“ Sailor told me Sam asked for your number , ”
46067	46072	46073	46073	I	0	“ It was nothing . ”
46099	46111	46094	46094	his	236	“ He just needed some help . Something work - related . ”
46112	46115	46116	46116	Persephone	176	“ Huh . ”
46130	46156	46119	46119	her	176	“ But maybe it ’s a start ? He never contacted you before , and you ’re hardly the only person he could turn to . ”
46195	46204	46190	46190	I	0	“ You ’re grasping at straws , Pers . ”
46205	46218	46219	46219	she	176	“ Weirder pairings have happened . Look at your brother and me , ”
46227	46238	46219	46219	she	176	“ You just need more patience as you pursue him . ”
46239	46265	46266	46266	I	0	“ Cillian always had a boner for you . He just hid it like a thirteen - year - old . Sam is not pursuable , ”
46335	46346	46347	46347	Persy	233	“ If your brothers are pursuable , so is Sam , ”
46355	46364	46347	46347	Persy	233	“ You should go for what you want . ”
46365	46380	46381	46381	I	0	“ But what if what I want is everything that ’s bad for me ? ”
46389	46435	46381	46381	I	0	“ What if I ’m stupid to want Sam Brennan ? He is a gangster . A murderer . An underground boss and my father ’s right hand . So many things can go wrong . If they ’ll go in any direction at all … ”
46436	46442	46443	46443	Persy	233	“ You just described love . ”
46446	46488	46443	46443	Persy	233	“ Love is a risk . It ’s a storm that either disrupts your life or clears your path . Sometimes it does both at the same time . Focus on getting the guy . Everything else will fall into place . ”
46697	46708	46709	46709	Devon	232	“ The concept of Thanksgiving is still jarring to me , ”
46755	46763	46731	46731	He	232	“ Who exactly are you lot thanking ? ”
46803	46808	46809	46809	Hunter	155	“ Um , God ? ”
46822	46866	46809	46809	Hunter	155	“ You ’re just bitter because we have stuff to be thankful for . Big - box stores , the First Amendment , Jewish deli food , and , of course , Scarlett Johansson . What do you have to be thankful for ? ”
46867	46882	46883	46883	Devon	232	“ Footie , brown sauce , and being generally intellectually superior to the Yanks , ”
46898	46905	46906	46907	My father	3933	“ By footie you mean soccer ? ”
46919	46939	46910	46910	He	3933	“ No , by football I mean football . The one where you kick the ball with your foot … ”
46951	46983	46910	46910	He	3933	“ … as opposed to holding it in your hand while running , crashing into random people like a barbarian trying to sneak the rival village ’s best - looking maiden . ”
46984	47010	47011	47011	Troy	123	“ Keep trashing football , and the only thing you ’ll be thankful for this Thanksgiving is getting out of this meal in one piece . ”
47024	47054	47055	47055	Devon	232	“ So , Sam , you ’re the last single man standing . Up for a quick trip to Sin City to play blackjack at the casino this weekend ? ”
47060	47067	47068	47068	Sparrow	122	“ You ’re still doing that ? ”
47082	47100	47068	47068	Sparrow	122	“ It ’s dangerous , not to mention reckless . You ’re already blacklisted from three hotels . ”
47116	47120	47121	47121	Hunter	155	“ Not surprised . ”
47133	47142	47121	47121	Hunter	155	“ Do I want to know what for ? ”
47143	47149	47150	47150	Devon	232	“ Winning too much money . ”
47158	47189	47150	47150	Devon	232	“ Sam is the best blackjack player I ’ve ever seen in my lifetime . A wizard with numbers , really . He makes all the calculations in split seconds . ”
47216	47227	47228	47228	Cillian	154	“ What a great way to utilize your analytical talent , ”
47232	47251	47252	47252	Sam	278	“ Better to waste a talent in the wrong place than not have one in the first place , ”
47256	47272	47273	47273	Cillian	154	“ Your main talent is to find your way into rich people ’s inner circle , ”
47280	47291	47276	47276	his	154	“ Which you ’ve been doing very well since childhood . ”
47292	47300	47301	47301	Hunter	155	“ Anyway , cards at Badland tonight , ”
47304	47309	47301	47301	Hunter	155	“ Right after dinner . ”

47399	47435	47394	47394	her	169	“ … I do n’t know what I would have done without her . She is my anchor . No wonder she works at bringing life into this planet . She is my perfect angel . ”
47436	47444	47445	47445	Emmabelle	160	“ She sure is saintly , ma’am . ”
47479	47488	47469	47469	I	0	“ Too good to be true . Almost . ”
47489	47509	47510	47511	my mother	3887	“ Right now , she is working day and night to help me with a charity event this month , ”
47592	47595	47575	47575	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
47621	47647	47648	47648	I	0	“ Yes . Of course . No , it is not a bad time at all . I ’m on my way . Thank you . ”
47754	47769	47770	47770	I	0	“ My apologies , but I have to run . Something important at work . ”
47793	47820	47781	47781	Everyone	485	“ Compliments to our chef . I will send her flowers tomorrow morning for her troubles . Thank you , everyone . Have a good evening . ”
48174	48180	48150	48150	I	0	“ It ’s not fair . ”
48200	48207	48150	48150	I	0	“ Nothing about this is fair . ”
48208	48214	48229	48229	Sam	278	“ Tell me about it , ”
48287	48329	48330	48330	He	278	“ Fair is where you get cotton candy . It has nothing to do with real life . Now , tell me how you found yourself in Westford as opposed to Brigham Hospital , where your ass should have been tonight . ”
48437	48466	48478	48478	he	278	“ Should n’t you be playing cards with my brothers at Badlands right about now ? Or are you missing Cook ’s famous apple pie to be here ? ”
48467	48477	48478	48478	he	278	“ Should n’t you be answering my fucking question ? ”
48481	48490	48491	48491	I	0	“ The answer is none of your business , ”
48496	48502	48503	48503	He	278	“ This old tune again . ”
48514	48582	48509	48509	he	278	“ You are my business . My boss ’ daughter . I should have kept tabs on you and tailed your ass earlier , but I did n’t . So here we are . Now let ’s cut the bullshit , shall we ? I checked everywhere worth checking and cross - examined my sources . You are not a resident at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital . ”
48603	48611	48597	48597	He	278	“ Been checking on me , Brennan ? ”
48625	48642	48612	48612	I	0	“ I ’m flattered , but not surprised . Still , that does n’t mean anything . ”
48643	48714	48715	48715	he	278	“ Sure it does . For starters , it means you are a fucking liar . My least favorite trait in people . But then I thought to myself , maybe the lie is n’t so big . Maybe it ’s about prestige . Little , perfect Aisling did n’t want her parents to know she did n’t get accepted to one of the most respected hospitals in the country … ”
48739	48762	48763	48763	I	0	“ … so I went and checked with all of the hospitals in Boston , every single fucking one . Guess what ? ”
48773	48812	48813	48813	he	278	“ You ’re not registered anywhere as a doctor . You turned all of them down . Every single fucking offer . At this point , I got suspicious . Did you even finish med school at all ? ”
48836	48869	48813	48813	he	278	“ So I sniffed around that angle , too . You did , in fact , graduate from Harvard Medical School . So it ’s not that you are n’t a doctor . ”
48901	48924	48925	48925	His	278	“ Whatever you do , you ’re doing it under the radar . What the fuck are you playing at , Nix ? ”
48970	48977	48963	48963	I	0	“ You really want to know ? ”
49053	49062	49063	49063	I	0	“ None . Of . Your . Business , ”
49106	49138	49139	49139	I	0	“ Do n’t play games with me , Aisling . I will win . Easily . And I ’m a bad sport and notoriously unfair , just like your miserable life . ”
49168	49176	49162	49162	I	0	“ Do you want to be humiliated ? ”
49186	49206	49207	49207	I	0	“ No . I want you to make up your mind about what you want to do with me , ”
49211	49234	49207	49207	I	0	“ You ’ve been running after me with your skirt up , begging to be fucked since before you got your period . ”
49296	49303	49272	49272	He	278	“ You … you … you … ”
49340	49425	49426	49426	I	0	“ Tore your pretty designer dress ? Do n’t worry . Daddy’ll buy you a hundred more . The pathetic part is you ’re not going to deny me because you and I both know I can fuck you whenever I want , however I want , however many times I want . Bend you over — the jewel of the Fitzpatrick crown , Princess Aisling of Avebury Court Manor — and ram my cock so deep inside your ass you ’ll see stars . ”
49533	49544	49516	49516	he	1754	“ What do you do for a living , Nix ? ”
49545	49551	49552	49552	I	0	“ Fuck y - you , ”
49567	49591	49592	49592	He	1754	“ I would n’t call that a full - time job . I usually grow bored of my fucks after a few hookups . ”
49674	49680	49681	49681	he	1754	“ Illegal , experimental drugs ? ”
49748	49770	49771	49771	He	1754	“ The no insurance , doctors - without - borders bullshit where you treat the poor ai n’t flying , sweetheart . ”
49806	49888	49889	49889	I	0	“ Whoever lives in that building does n’t get monthly food stamps . Take it from someone who looked poverty in the eye . I ’d hate to blow your cover and kick in every door at the complex to find the asshole you visited and milk your secret out of them . But I ’ll do it if I have to . So for the last time , Aisling , tell me what the fuck it is that you do . ”
50011	50016	50017	50017	I	0	“ I was close , ”
50020	50033	50017	50017	I	0	“ Tough fucking luck . For more information , go to www.lifeain’tfairandwe’vebeenthroughthis.com . ”

50048	50119	50040	50040	I	0	“ The hell is you are a fucking headache and need to be taught a lesson . I am going to get the truth out of you , Aisling , one way or the other , but until I do , you lose all cumming privileges . Not by my hands , anyway , and let ’s admit it — your sole purpose in life is getting fucked by me . ”
50195	50205	50206	50206	I	0	“ Why do you even care what I do ? ”
50226	50250	50206	50206	I	0	“ You made it perfectly clear you do n’t give a damn about me . You spent a whole decade dodging my advances . ”
50333	50337	50338	50338	he	278	“ Circumstances change , ”
50341	50347	50338	50338	he	278	“ Yes , they do , ”
50351	50402	50403	50403	He	278	“ Which is why I suggest you stop assuming I am always going to be at your disposal . I ’m not the same girl you met at the carnival , Sam . I ’m all grown up , and I wo n’t be treated like I ’m a toy . ”
50411	50415	50403	50403	He	278	“ Wanna bet ? ”
50416	50433	50434	50434	I	0	“ How are we going to settle the bet ? In your card room at Badlands ? ”
50460	50470	50471	50471	he	278	“ No . You ’re not allowed in Badlands , ”
50479	50486	50471	50471	he	278	“ But Sailor and Persy are . ”
50491	50518	50487	50487	I	0	“ Sailor and Persy are not running around looking for trouble . They stay at home with their babies . I suggest you do the same . ”

50533	50544	50527	50527	I	0	“ Oh , and it ’s not the nineteenth century . ”
50545	50566	50487	50487	I	0	“ You might be annoying , but I ’m sure you ’ll find a schmuck willing to knock you up . ”
50567	50593	50487	50487	I	0	“ What about Belle ? How come she ’s allowed in Badlands ? She looks for trouble all the time . Much more than me . ”
50594	50627	50527	50527	I	0	“ Belle is damaged goods and also none of my fucking business . If you end up catching the clap in Badlands ’ restroom , your family will come crying to me . ”
50628	50635	50487	50487	I	0	“ You ’re a sexist pig . ”
50636	50656	50487	50487	I	0	“ And you are still interested . What does it say about you , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Jr. ? ”
50697	50723	50724	50724	He	278	“ Hold onto those little secrets of yours , Nix . Because I ’m going to have one hell of a good time unraveling them . ”
50932	50939	50940	50940	I	0	“ Where are you taking him ? ”

51000	51010	50992	50992	I	0	“ Why ? What happened ? Where ’s Mother ? ”
51011	51036	51037	51037	Hunter	155	“ Mother is hiding in her room crying about how Da stole the show , being a real fucking adult about it per usual , ”
51057	51091	51037	51037	Hunter	155	“ As for Athair , he ’s been vomiting nonstop since you left , has diarrhea , a dry mouth , a rash , trouble breathing , and he fainted twice since dessert . ”
51101	51110	51092	51092	Cillian	154	“ How would you diagnose that , Doc ? ”
51111	51135	51050	51050	his	155	“ Well , I need to run more tests , of course , but at first glance I would say he was poisoned . ”
51136	51143	51144	51144	Hunter	155	“ Ding , ding , ding , ”
51148	51172	51144	51144	Hunter	155	“ When Da finished his cup of coffee , he proceeded to collapse on top of the table like a stack of cards . ”
51182	51189	51144	51144	Hunter	155	“ I ’m coming with you . ”
51190	51199	51200	51200	Hunter	155	“ You just got back from the hospital , ”
51267	51273	51279	51279	Cillian	154	“ It ’s no trouble . ”
51274	51278	51279	51279	Cillian	154	“ Your funeral , ”
51282	51314	51279	51279	Cillian	154	“ Hunter , let her take the passenger seat . C’m on , Ash . We ’re taking the car . We do n’t want the headlines an ambulance would create . ”
51315	51320	51321	51321	Hunter	155	“ Forever the Fitzpatricks . ”
51345	51355	51335	51335	I	0	“ Sure you ’re okay leaving your baby behind ? ”
51374	51379	51356	51356	Hunt	228	“ Do n’t start . ”
51380	51384	51385	51385	Hunter	155	“ No shade . ”
51394	51433	51385	51385	Hunter	155	“ All I ’m saying is she is probably writing all of us out of her will because we are driving Da to the hospital instead of telling her how pretty she is — after she poisoned him . ”
51650	51656	51657	51657	I	0	“ It ’s not Mother . ”
51693	51698	51736	51736	Hunter	155	“ It ’s not . ”
51699	51735	51736	51736	Hunter	155	“ Oh , come on , Ash . At the very least , it ’s an option worth considering . They ’ve been at each other ’s throats for as long as I can remember . ”
51783	51796	51774	51774	I	0	“ No , Hunt . She is incapable of hurting a fly . ”
51885	51910	51911	51911	Cillian	154	“ She is also the only person at the table with a hard - on to see Gerald return his equipment to the Almighty , ”
52033	52040	52041	52041	I	0	“ Let ’s make a list ! ”
52060	52076	52050	52050	Sam	278	“ Of who was there . Then we can go through it and dig deeper . ”
52077	52083	52084	52084	Hunter	155	“ All right , Sherlock . ”
52097	52119	52084	52084	Hunter	155	“ Let ’s see , there was Xander , Rooney , and Astor , all of them under three years old … ”
52120	52138	52139	52139	Cillian	154	“ Astor ’s been teething . He can be a mean little thing when he is teething , ”
52155	52186	52187	52187	Hunter	155	“ Rooney has a mean streak , too . But she usually pees on the carpet when she seeks her revenge upon us . Then there was Sailor and me , ”
52190	52211	52187	52187	Hunter	155	“ Neither of us have beef with Da . And you , Ash , do n’t have a motive either . ”
52212	52244	52245	52245	Cillian	154	“ Persephone and I are out of the question . My wife could n’t hurt a fly if she tried , and I already have everything I ever needed from Gerald , ”
52248	52278	52245	52245	Cillian	154	“ And then there ’s Emmabelle . A distasteful excuse for a human being , sure , but I would n’t go as far as calling her a murderer . ”
52279	52296	52297	52297	I	0	“ Whoever did this did n’t try to kill him . They tried to spook him , ”
52301	52320	52297	52297	I	0	“ But I agree , Emmabelle has no connection to Da whatsoever . What about Troy ? Sparrow ? ”
52321	52346	52347	52347	Hunter	155	“ As far as I ’m aware , Troy and Sparrow have no business with Athair . No reason to want to threaten him . ”
52352	52355	52349	52349	his	155	“ Devon ? ”
52375	52379	52360	52360	Cillian	154	“ No motive . ”
52380	52389	52371	52371	his	154	“ True , but he is not family . ”
52390	52395	52396	52396	Cillian	154	“ Neither is Sam . ”
52402	52415	52399	52399	his	154	“ I think we should keep an eye on him , too , ”
52438	52466	52434	52434	Hunter	155	“ Whoa , whoa , whoa , keep an eye how … ? We were joking , but … he ’s my brother - in - law . ”
52467	52480	52481	52481	Cillian	154	“ He is also the most corrupt man to walk this earth . ”
52490	52507	52481	52481	Cillian	154	“ I ’ll deal with him . Sniff around . See what he is up to . ”
52508	52511	52512	52512	I	0	“ No … ”
52519	52532	52434	52434	Hunter	155	“ … I ’ll do it . He wo n’t suspect me . ”
52533	52538	52539	52539	Hunter	155	“ I suspect you . ”
52546	52578	52539	52539	Hunter	155	“ No offense , sis , but even Rooney knows Auntie Ash is in lurveeee with Uncle Sam . And I do n’t mean you being patriotic toward the US of A. ”
52579	52591	52592	52592	I	0	“ But see , that ’s what makes it so perfect , ”
52596	52612	52592	52592	I	0	“ He will never see me as a threat or think I could harm him . ”
52613	52623	52624	52624	Cillian	154	“ I do n’t want him anywhere near you , ”
52627	52649	52624	52624	Cillian	154	“ Well , tough luck , big bro . I ’m twenty - seven . You ca n’t shelter me forever . ”
52650	52654	52655	52655	Hunter	155	“ Wanna bet ? ”
52680	52704	52705	52705	Cillian	154	“ Fine . Ash , you can sniff around Sam . Just remember it is frowned upon to have sex with your target , ”
52708	52716	52705	52705	Cillian	154	“ I ’ll check the Devon angle . ”
52717	52727	52728	52728	Hunter	155	“ And I ’ll pray for both your souls . ”
52740	52841	52737	52737	his	155	“ Because both of y’ all are dumbasses who watch too much CSI . It ’s Jane . She wanted to get back at Da for sticking his dick in the wrong hole and things got a little bit out of hand . Not the first time she did something drastic and threw a fit . Remember when he gifted her the butterfly garden after she found out he ’d been screwing her own sister ? Not that I ever liked this particular auntie , but she threw his Rolex collection into the food processor and set it to high . ”
52885	52932	52936	52936	his	154	“ Thanks for the little trip down memory lane to remind me I am the spawn of two of the most disgusting people to ever grace the planet . Now , if that is all , I ’d like to go back to running my company . ”
52951	52991	52936	52936	his	154	“ May the best man win , Aisling . You think it ’s Sam , Hunter thinks it ’s Mother , and I think Gerald has been spending too much time at the medicine cabinet and had an oopsie . ”
53149	53160	53161	53161	Cillian	154	“ The hostile takeover for FMK Petroleum is well underway . ”
53172	53182	53161	53161	Cillian	154	“ We just need to finalize the small print . ”

53304	53346	53300	53300	I	0	“ Their CEO wo n’t say no to the deal . I dug up too much dirt on him . By the time I ’m done , he ’ll be happy to sell you his shares for a fucking Costco membership . ”
53347	53353	53354	53354	Gerald	180	“ That ’s my boy . ”

53411	53427	53401	53401	Devon	232	“ All that ’s left is to hope the CEO has pull with the shareholders . ”

53669	53689	53658	53658	Gerald	180	“ That ’s the point where I ’m supposed to ask how you ’re doing , right , Gerry ? ”
53700	53704	53690	53690	I	0	“ It is . ”
53709	53729	53690	53690	I	0	“ And the answer is terrible . I am beside myself . I moved out of my marital bedroom . ”
53730	53737	53738	53738	I	0	“ Ah , the old doghouse , ”
53753	53803	53738	53738	I	0	“ The doghouse is better than sharing a bed with a bitch . I do n’t want to be anywhere near her . She goddamn nearly killed me , Sam . And the worst part is she is still denying it . Trying to poison me . Damn woman . ”
53843	53851	53852	53852	I	0	“ Have you made the list yet ? ”
53855	53875	53852	53852	I	0	“ The faster we get to the bottom of this , the quicker we can move on from this . ”

The thirteen attributes of mercy are a central theme throughout these prayers .

I have a feeling one day you ’ll wake up and realize you need to atone — to receive forgiveness — for your sins . I think this day is fast approaching , and having a tombstone to go visit will serve you well . ”

59227	59238	59239	59239	she	115	“ I was n’t even anywhere near you all day ! ”
59253	59277	59245	59245	her	115	“ You did n’t have to be . The PTSD of fucking you put me off the whole concept for life . Congratulations . ”
59278	59304	59305	59305	she	115	“ That ’s why you had to finger me again , right ? Just to make sure it really was that horrible the first time , ”
59309	59325	59326	59326	I	0	“ I fingered you to deny you an orgasm , not because I wanted you , ”
59330	59348	59326	59326	I	0	“ You really know how to woo a girl . No wonder I was obsessed with you . ”
59349	59352	59353	59353	I	0	“ Was ? ”
59370	59405	59353	59353	I	0	“ Last I checked , you are still running after me like a puppy and even took it to the next level and are now showing up at my place , creeper - style . ”
59406	59427	59326	59326	I	0	“ You show up at my place all the time , too . I do n’t call you a creeper . ”
59428	59456	59353	59353	I	0	“ That ’s different . I work with your father . I can not escape the sight of you , no matter how much I want to . ”
59487	59493	59494	59494	She	2014	“ Where have you been ? ”
59523	59555	59556	59556	I	0	“ Allow me to answer you with your favorite goddamn expression : none of your business . How did you find my address ? Do not say none of your business , ”
59559	59562	59556	59556	I	0	“ Google . ”
59563	59570	59571	59571	I	0	“ Do n’t lie to me . ”
59635	59642	59643	59643	she	2014	“ Do n’t ask tough questions , ”
59647	59653	59643	59643	she	2014	“ My address is untraceable . ”
59654	59670	59671	59671	She	2014	“ Well , Batman , I think both of us know that is n’t true . ”
59676	59701	59671	59671	She	2014	“ Can you remove your fingers from my neck ? I ’d hate to traumatize you further with skin - to - skin contact . ”
59907	59915	59899	59899	I	0	“ Look , can I come in ? ”
59980	59983	59984	59984	I	0	“ No , ”
59988	59997	59984	59984	I	0	“ I really need to talk to someone . ”
59998	60009	60026	60026	her	115	“ I suggest you turn to a person who cares . ”
60010	60018	60019	60019	she	115	“ You do n’t care about me ? ”
60096	60105	60106	60106	She	115	“ Not even a little . Go away . ”
60111	60159	60160	60160	she	115	“ I need to vent . It ’s about my parents . Everyone else has a horse in this race . My brothers , Mother , and Da … even my best friends are married to my siblings , so they ca n’t be clearheaded about it , ”
60284	60297	60298	60298	I	0	“ Fine . But I ’m not gon na fuck you again , ”
60339	60347	60348	60348	She	115	“ Well , that ’s a relief . ”
60364	60381	60348	60348	She	115	“ And I promise not to try to seduce you again . Now , shall we ? ”
60404	60411	60412	60412	she	115	“ May I have some coffee ? ”
60416	60429	60412	60412	she	115	“ Would you like a fucking full English breakfast along with it ? ”
60439	60448	60430	60430	I	0	“ No , you ca n’t have coffee . ”
60449	60465	60516	60516	She	115	“ I think we both need a few moments to gather ourselves before this conversation . ”
60466	60504	60505	60505	We	2035	“ The only part of me in need of gathering is getting my cock into someone ’s mouth , and since I do n’t want you anywhere near it , I suggest you cut to the chase . ”
60521	60538	60516	60516	She	115	“ You ’re not going to talk until I get you a coffee , are you ? ”
60549	60554	60544	60544	She	115	“ ’ Fraid not . ”
60817	60822	60823	60823	she	115	“ Let me go ! ”
60832	60840	60823	60823	she	115	“ Coming here was a huge mistake . ”
60841	60891	60892	60892	I	0	“ Could n’t agree with you more . Yet you ’re here , so you ’re sure as hell going to see this through . I know the Fitzpatrick clan is used to other people finishing shit for them , but this time you ’ll have to pull through . ”
60956	60973	60974	60974	She	115	“ Let me guess , there is a perfectly good explanation for the bullets , right ? ”
61002	61006	61007	61007	I	0	“ There is , ”
61010	61020	61007	61007	I	0	“ but you are not going to like it . ”
61021	61027	61028	61028	she	115	“ I ’m all ears , ”
61060	61064	61031	61031	I	0	“ You calm ? ”
61065	61074	61075	61075	she	115	“ Do n’t treat me like a baby , ”
61078	61085	61075	61075	she	115	“ Do n’t act like one , ”
61089	61106	61086	61086	I	0	“ Why do you have bullets in a jar ? Dozens of them , no less . ”
61107	61123	61124	61124	I	0	“ Why do you think I do n’t want people to get into my apartment ? ”
61150	61153	61154	61154	Her	115	“ Evidence . ”
61163	61178	61159	61159	she	115	“ I take the bullets out of the people I kill and keep them . ”
61265	61285	61254	61254	I	0	“ See this ? M.V. ? Mervin Vitelli . I engrave their initials , so I do n’t forget . ”
61286	61295	61296	61296	She	115	“ Why do n’t you want to forget ? ”
61422	61446	61408	61408	She	115	“ I knew you killed people , but it ’s very different to actually see proof of how many lives you ’ve taken . ”
61447	61496	61497	61497	I	0	“ The first one is the most meaningful one . After that , taking lives feels the same . Like a second or third bite of an ice cream cone . Of course , it does n’t hurt to know the people I kill are pieces of shit , ”
61500	61507	61508	61508	she	115	“ I ’m not so sure , ”
61528	61537	61538	61538	I	0	“ You came here to talk . Talk , ”
61655	61664	61665	61665	Her	115	“ My mother wants to file for divorce . ”
61681	61690	61691	61691	she	115	“ I know it sounds ridiculous to you , ”
61696	61834	61835	61835	she	2063	“ After all , it ’s a well - known fact my parents have never been faithful to one another . Their marriage is considered a sham in most social circles of New England . But for me , it means something . It means a lot , actually . Growing up , I knew I had the stability of Avebury Court Manor . Even though Mother and Da were n’t a functional couple , they were still a couple in their own strange way . Believe it or not , Sam , they worked . I know I ’m not an impressionable teenager anymore and worse things happen to twenty - seven - year - olds . Some people lose their parents , their partners , even their children , but I just do n’t understand … ”
61853	61919	61920	61920	I	0	“ … how everything escalated so quickly . One moment we were leading a normal life — as normal as life could be for us — and the next everything exploded . The provocative pictures of Da and that … that woman materializing out of nowhere , the poisoning . Someone is trying to ruin my father , and Athair thinks it ’s my mother . ”
62011	62019	62020	62020	she	2063	“ Do you really have no lead ? ”
62056	62087	62040	62040	She	2063	“ That ’s weird . You are usually so resourceful . I ca n’t recall the last time you could n’t help my family when we got ourselves into trouble . ”
62115	62120	62093	62093	her	2063	“ Patience , Nix . ”
62121	62128	62093	62093	her	2063	“ Are you a patient man ? ”
62129	62144	62093	62093	her	2063	“ I do n’t hold myself to the same standards I hold you to . ”
62145	62150	62093	62093	her	2063	“ That ’s convenient . ”
62151	62158	62159	62159	I	0	“ I lead a convenient life . ”
62170	62198	62159	62159	I	0	“ Anyway , look at the bright side . Two houses . Two parents . Two Christmas trees . Two sets of presents and so fucking forth . ”
62199	62206	62207	62207	Her	2063	“ I ’m not a kid . ”
62218	62230	62213	62213	I	0	“ You sure act like one where your parents are involved . ”
62231	62243	62244	62244	Her	2063	“ What would you do if you were in my position ? ”
62273	62301	62264	62264	you	2063	“ Let them sort this shit out by themselves . They are grown - ups , and you are not the parent . You ’re the kid . ”
62405	62415	62416	62416	she	115	“ I am sort of my mother ’s parent , ”
62419	62427	62416	62416	she	115	“ She relies on me … mentally . ”
62428	62442	62469	62469	her	115	“ That , to use the technical term , is fucked - up . ”
62443	62466	62467	62467	She	115	“ Maybe , but it ’s the truth . My life is … not as pretty as it seems from the outside . ”
62647	62704	62705	62705	I	0	“ Boo - fucking - hoo , sweetheart . You ’re young , beautiful , and rich enough to buy happiness . So your parents are about to get a divorce and hate each other ’s guts . Welcome to the twenty - first century . You are officially joining fifty percent of people in the U.S. ”
62764	62775	62776	62776	she	2079	“ My life is not as charmed as you think , ”
62782	62847	62776	62776	she	2079	“ For one thing , growing up I never saw real love . A healthy relationship between a man and a woman . At least you had Sparrow and Troy . My childhood was an endless stream of arguments , object tossing , and my parents disappearing to Europe for months at a time , together or alone , leaving me with the nannies . ”
62875	62896	62897	62897	Her	2079	“ Then I lost someone I really cared about when I was seventeen , in a pretty … brutal way . ”
62937	62946	62947	62947	I	0	“ What else have you got for me ? ”
62964	62969	62970	62970	She	2079	“ My first time … ”
62991	63000	62976	62976	her	2079	“ I lost my virginity to my professor . ”
63001	63007	63036	63036	her	2079	“ How old was he ? ”
63008	63013	63036	63036	her	2079	“ Forty - one . ”
63014	63018	62976	62976	her	2079	“ And you ? ”
63019	63022	63036	63036	her	2079	“ Nineteen . ”
63023	63027	63036	63036	her	2079	“ That ’s — ”
63028	63031	63032	63032	She	2079	“ Disgusting ? ”
63062	63074	63043	63043	I	0	“ Yeah , I know . Wanna know the disgusting part ? ”
63075	63088	63089	63089	She	2079	“ I thought I already knew . He was forty - one . ”
63096	63149	63150	63150	she	2079	“ I found out three weeks after we started sleeping together that he was married with a kid . See , he did n’t wear a wedding band and lived in an apartment complex on campus , alone . He looked young and stylish and hung out with the students so often … ”
63162	63295	63150	63150	she	2079	“ … I wanted to lose my virginity to someone with experience , and I knew he had it . We continued seeing each other after we had sex . Until one day he just disappeared into thin air . Stopped answering my calls . Just got up and left . He did n’t even complete the academic year . I needed some sort of closure , so I found him . And , well , I found out why he left . Because of me . Because his wife , who taught at another university two states away , had found out and dragged him back home by the ear . When I found his new address , I made the mistake of driving down there and knocking on his door . ”
63333	63424	63317	63317	she	115	“ She opened the door and threw the phone he ’d used to call me . She started screaming at me in front of the entire neighborhood , calling me a whore , a homewrecker , a spoiled bitch . She said my mother is a slut , that everyone in America knows one of us does n’t belong to Fitzpatrick , then promised she would let all the hospitals in Boston know what I did . It was humiliating . Especially since I never knew this man was married . ”
63425	63437	63438	63438	I	0	“ Is that why you never tried for a hospital here ? ”
63462	63493	63441	63441	She	2082	“ Partly . Maybe . I do n’t know . It ’s not the entire reason , anyway . Since then , I limited my interaction with men even more . ”
63494	63497	63498	63498	I	0	“ Good , ”
63501	63507	63498	63498	I	0	“ We ’re all fuckers . ”
63541	63547	63548	63548	She	2082	“ Tell me something personal . ”
63556	63572	63548	63548	She	2082	“ Just one thing , Sam . It will make me feel better . Please . ”
63573	63584	63548	63548	She	2082	“ Aisling , it ’s time for you to go . ”
63585	63588	63548	63548	She	2082	“ Why ? ”
63589	63696	63548	63548	She	2082	“ Because this is going nowhere fast . We fucked . It was a mistake . It ’s time you move on . Whatever you think is going to happen , I can assure you it wo n’t happen . I do n’t have a soul , or a heart , or a conscience . We had fun , yes , but women are all the same to me . I will never choose you above all others . If you think life with Gerry is a nightmare for your mother , imagine your father at his worst and keep going . That would be me . ”
63740	63745	63746	63746	I	0	“ Goddammit , woman , ”
63823	63951	63952	63952	I	0	“ When I was a kid , before Troy and Sparrow took me in , back when I lived with Cat and my grandmother , we had a painting in our house . Just the one . It was a very cheap painting . A faded old thing of a cabin on a lake — basic and not very good . Anyway , the painting was in front of the bed in the master bedroom . It had the tendency to fall from its nail onto the floor every time the door creaked or someone breathed in the house . Cat was the only person with a key to the master bedroom , and she had n’t figured out I ’d learned how to pick a lock . ”
64005	64102	64103	64103	She	210	“ When I was a kid , Cat used to punish me by starving me . In order to do that , she made the spot under her bed a makeshift pantry . That ’s where she kept all the food . Condiments , chips , pretzels , ready - made meals . Grams was n’t strong enough to fight her on this . As you know , I was a shitty kid , so I was virtually in a constant state of punishment . That made me very hungry and very small for my age . ”
64143	64215	64136	64136	I	0	“ At some point , I figured I could just break into the room and grab Ramen or a bag of chips or something . And I did . Often . But Cat had the tendency to come in at the most inconvenient time . When I did n’t have time to run away from her room , I had to hide under the bed , buried beneath the junk food . ”
64243	64297	64230	64230	Aisling	115	“ Cat was a whore , so more often than not , when she came home , she was n’t alone . I stopped counting after the fourth time I had to sneak under her bed and felt the springs of the mattress digging into my back as someone fucked her above me . ”
64312	64315	64316	64316	she	115	“ No , ”
64319	64322	64316	64316	she	115	“ Yes . ”
64331	64490	64323	64323	I	0	“ I felt the weight of my mother ’s sins , figuratively and literally . They fucked her over my back . Again and again and again . While I shivered , dizzy with hunger , every muscle in my body strained so I would n’t make a sudden move and make myself known . My most distinct childhood memory is that stupid painting . Every time the headboard hit the opposite wall , it would drop , but not facedown , so I could always see the cabin and the lake staring right back at me , as if they caught me red - handed . We had a relationship , this painting and I. I felt like it was taunting me . Reminding me of my shitty life , and every time I looked at it , I could feel the blue and purple dents on my back from the rusty bedsprings digging into my skin . ”
64491	64499	64500	64500	she	2089	“ You do n’t have any paintings , ”
64534	64537	64527	64527	I	0	“ Nope . ”
64538	64548	64549	64549	I	0	“ My house must be very triggering for you . ”
64580	64587	64557	64557	I	0	“ I do n’t have triggers . ”
64588	64593	64594	64594	she	2089	“ Everyone has triggers , ”
64597	64623	64594	64594	she	2089	“ Not me . I let hate fester and redirect it into ambition . I welcome my weaknesses and do n’t shy away from them . ”
64665	64673	64674	64674	she	2089	“ Is this why you hate women ? ”
64677	64685	64674	64674	she	2089	“ Because Cat wronged you so much ? ”
64686	64704	64705	64705	I	0	“ I do n’t hate them . I just do n’t want much to do with them , ”
64708	64719	64705	64705	I	0	“ Well , I want something to do with you . ”
64758	64761	64745	64745	I	0	“ No . ”
64769	64805	64762	64762	I	0	“ Here . You got it off of your chest , and even got a little bonus with my sob story . Now get the fuck out , Nix . And do n’t come back . ”
64806	64810	64811	64811	She	2089	“ But I — ”
64953	64956	64957	64957	I	0	“ Shit … ”
64969	64976	64977	64977	Her	2089	“ Shit . Shit . Shit . ”
65367	65370	65371	65371	Cillian	154	“ Well ? ”
65456	65470	65451	65451	I	0	“ Could n’t find anything , and he did n’t volunteer any information . ”
65471	65498	65451	65451	I	0	“ Of course you could n’t . Because Sam has better things to do with his time than to mess with Athair for no apparent reason . ”
65499	65516	65451	65451	I	0	“ He was the only person at the table capable of poisoning one of the guests . ”
65517	65571	65451	65451	I	0	“ Athair had an oopsie visit to the hospital . Give that pretty head of yours a rest , Ash . Sam is innocent — in this case , of course . In general , he is probably responsible for every other bad thing that happened in Massachusetts since 1998 . Case closed . ”
65591	65618	65577	65577	he	278	“ Tell me you ’ll drop it . I have enough on my plate as it is . I do n’t need to extinguish another fire . ”
65619	65622	65623	65623	I	0	“ Fine , ”
65627	65636	65623	65623	I	0	“ I wo n’t sniff around him anymore . ”
65637	65640	65641	65641	he	278	“ Promise ? ”
65644	65647	65641	65641	he	278	“ Promise . ”
65922	65933	65903	65903	Sailor	130	“ This is his version of sending me dick pics . ”
65934	65942	65943	65943	Persy	233	“ But it ’s not a dick . ”
65951	65959	65943	65943	Persy	233	“ Not an anatomical one , anyway , ”
66470	66526	66527	66527	Mother	169	“ Aisling , could you be a darling and ask your brothers to go say hi to Mr. Arlington ? He made such a substantial donation to our charity tonight , and I know he ’s been vying for Cillian ’s attention for a long time . He needs advice about his new offshore company . ”
66757	66776	66777	66777	I	0	“ I will , but for the record you ’ll have to talk to them at some point , ”
66800	66898	66787	66787	She	3887	“ Have to ? I doubt it . I have to speak to my banker at some point to settle everything ahead of the divorce . And my landscaper — the rosebushes need a proper trim . Oh , and certainly my hairstylist . But my sons ? There is nothing I need from them . If I want to see my grandchildren , I can talk directly to their wives . I would actually prefer that as Sailor and Persephone at least treat me like their equal and do n’t believe I poisoned my own husband . ”
66899	66909	66910	66910	I	0	“ Speaking of your husband , what about him ? ”

66954	67040	66787	66787	She	3887	“ Your father and I seem to have reached a boiling point after simmering over the edge of disaster for decades . He ’s become paranoid and wrongfully mistrusting . Quite vulgar , seeing as I ’m not the one who pops into the headlines every few months with a new affair . I hate to say this , Aisling my dear , but we might have reached the end of the road . I do n’t see us coming back from this particular crisis . ”
67041	67058	67059	67059	I	0	“ Well , then I suggest you speak to him before you hand him divorce papers . ”

67379	67442	67443	67443	I	0	“ The party ’s in full swing and the donation box is jam - packed . Do n’t tell me the old bat found a reason to be unhappy again . Let me guess , the flowers are not fresh enough or someone failed to compliment her on her dress — which , by the way , makes her look like drywall . ”
67457	67474	67443	67443	I	0	“ She asked if you two could introduce yourselves to Mr. Arlington , right over there . ”

67743	67756	67757	67757	Hunter	155	“ And he brought a replica of our sister , no less , ”
67807	67863	67803	67803	his	2187	“ They say he killed his first victim at thirteen . Under the guidance of his adoptive father , Troy Brennan . I worked at the DA ’s office at the time . Read the postmortem report . The damage he inflicted was frightening . You know , we never found the bullet he used . ”

68291	68324	68325	68326	The woman	2184	“ It ’s just a woman . They make over fifty percent of the world ’s population , last I checked . Is Persephone failing in her duties to keep you entertained ? ”

68560	68568	68569	68569	I	0	“ Hello . I ’m right here ! ”
68582	68609	68569	68569	I	0	“ No need to fight my battles for me . Also , I think it ’s time to use your right to remain silent , Brennan . ”

69004	69048	69001	69001	Cillian	154	“ Aisling and you have never exchanged as much as a sentence , yet you have a nickname for her ? You ’re going to have to give me an explanation , seeing as I pay you extra not to touch my sister . ”
69174	69195	69170	69170	his	278	“ It was the first time I saw your sister . At dinner when Sailor and Hunter started living together . ”
69216	69317	69318	69318	He	2227	“ I excused myself to go to the bathroom just as she got out of it . Her dress was stuffed inside her underwear from behind , her ass and legs on full display . I told her that she needed to untuck her dress . She cried in horror and said , ‘ Oh , no , my knickers ! ’ She explained to me that underwear are called knickers in British English . Since then , I call her Nix , because she is a goofball who ca n’t dress properly . Is n’t that right , Nix ? ”
69359	69366	69343	69343	Sam	278	“ Since when do you date ? ”
69379	69388	69367	69367	Hunter	155	“ Since I changed my mind about marriage . ”

69428	69463	69425	69425	he	653	“ Riveting . I clearly remember you giving me a one - hour speech about the merits of staying single shortly before I married Persephone . Should I bill you for my lost time ? ”
69464	69468	69469	69469	Sam	278	“ People change . ”
69476	69485	69469	69469	Sam	278	“ You should know that better than anyone . ”

69496	69503	69504	69504	Hunter	155	“ So is Becca the one ? ”
69574	69579	69580	69580	he	278	“ I hope so , ”
69591	69622	69580	69580	he	278	“ She has everything I look for in a woman . Beautiful , well - educated , and honest . Bonus points : her family is not a complete mess . ”
69648	69672	69646	69646	Cillian	154	“ Anyway , I delivered the message Mother sent me here for . Do with it what you will . Enjoy your evening . ”

70280	70300	70301	70301	I	0	“ My , my . You give tacky a whole new meaning , do n’t you , Mr. Brennan . ”
70339	70380	70381	70381	I	0	“ You know , Samuel , that ’s what separates the nouveau riche from true aristocrats . Your impartialness to knockoffs . Could n’t get your hands on the real thing , so you decided to settle for a replica . ”
70446	70482	70483	70483	I	0	“ Did you tell her you hate women ? That you do n’t want children ? How much you loathe yourself ? Did she see your apartment ? Your inside ? All your dirty secrets ? ”
70527	70540	70541	70541	I	0	“ Yeah . I guess not . A word to the wise … ”
70546	70595	70596	70596	I	0	“ … run , do n’t walk . He is trouble and not the tamable kind . He will use you , play you , and discard you . That ’s the only thing he knows how to do . Because that ’s what was done to him . ”

70991	71030	70970	70970	He	2259	“ I am used to women who are rougher around the edges . Sparrow . Sailor . Even Cat . They have masculine strength about them . They refuse to be pushed around and never shed a tear . ”

71050	71062	71040	71040	I	0	“ It just means you ’re in touch with your emotions . ”
71068	71112	71063	71063	He	2259	“ I did n’t say you were weak . But you are a complex little thing , and I never know if I get the ball - busting version of you or the docile one who trails behind her mother like a toddler . ”
71113	71130	71131	71131	He	2259	“ Thank you for the psychological assessment . Did you enjoy your rendezvous with your date ? ”
71141	71160	71133	71133	his	2259	“ What ’s with the French words ? Why not say hookup like the rest of modern civilization ? ”

71206	71243	71193	71193	he	2259	“ Well , as it happens , I did n’t enjoy Becca at all because you scared the living shit out of her . This is now the second fuck you ’ve cost me , Nix . ”
71244	71251	71252	71252	I	0	“ Nix like knickers , right ? ”
71295	71304	71284	71284	He	2259	“ I had to think on my feet . ”

71351	71361	71325	71325	he	2259	“ She left . I called her an Uber . ”
71362	71374	71375	71375	I	0	“ You still brought her here . That ’s the point . ”
71388	71403	71375	71375	I	0	“ You still paraded her . Flaunted her . Kissed her in the cloakroom . ”
71404	71411	71412	71412	he	2259	“ I did n’t kiss her , ”
71421	71430	71415	71415	his	2259	“ But when I came in you were — ”
71431	71437	71438	71438	he	2259	“ I skipped that part , ”
71441	71455	71438	71438	he	2259	“ The kissing part . I wanted you to get the general picture . ”
71456	71459	71460	71460	I	0	“ Well … ”
71463	71519	71460	71460	I	0	“ … I got it , all right . Mission accomplished . I now know you will go to extreme lengths to push me away . We have such a frightening ability to get under each other ’s skin in the worst , most terrible way . I think I ’m finally done with you . ”
71562	71576	71577	71577	he	2259	“ Why do I have a feeling you are playing me , Aisling ? ”
71596	71603	71586	71586	I	0	“ Who said I was n’t ? ”
71604	71636	71663	71663	He	2259	“ Your doe - like , please - don’t - eat - me eyes . But I ’m starting to see there ’s much more to you than I initially thought . ”
71637	71658	71659	71659	I	0	“ Your opinion of me was n’t very high in the first place , so that ’s not saying much . ”
71674	71721	71663	71663	He	2259	“ I checked your IRS file . You do n’t have an income . Whatever you do is either voluntary or paid under the table . With your family going through audits every single year , I doubt you are stupid enough to meddle with money . ”
71722	71725	71726	71726	I	0	“ What ? ”
71731	71736	71726	71726	I	0	“ How dare you — ”
71737	71766	71767	71767	I	0	“ Easily . That ’s how . Now it ’s your turn to answer a question . What is it that you do in this clinic , Nix ? ”
71860	71865	71866	71866	I	0	“ Pull me back ! ”
71880	71883	71884	71884	He	278	“ Please ! ”
71906	71960	71884	71884	He	278	“ I do n’t think so , sweetheart . First , you owe me a few truths . You ’ll start by telling me what you did outside my apartment a week ago . Because looking back , you could n’t have come there just because you needed a shoulder to cry on . ”
71961	71965	71966	71966	I	0	“ I did ! ”
71972	71975	71966	71966	I	0	“ I — ”

72130	72136	72127	72127	I	0	“ You sure about that ? ”
72174	72184	72139	72139	his	278	“ Why did you take the bullet , Nix ? ”
72185	72190	72139	72139	his	278	“ Sam , please — ”
72191	72195	72139	72139	his	278	“ Answer me . ”

72226	72241	72242	72242	I	0	“ Because I knew it was from the man you killed at the carnival ! ”
72252	72344	72242	72242	I	0	“ My obsession with you started right after that damned carnival . I checked the news to see who was killed there , guessing correctly that they ’d found the body . I found his name — Mason Kipling — and read that he was a human trafficker who had been wanted by the FBI . I put two and two together . Realized you had some beef with the guy . When I saw the bullet , M.K. , I could n’t help myself . I took it . Happy ? ”
72405	72416	72417	72417	His	2275	“ Now tell me why you came to my apartment . ”
72438	72441	72417	72417	His	2275	“ No . ”
72442	72452	72417	72417	His	2275	“ Tell me what you do in that clinic . ”

72880	72883	72884	72884	he	2275	“ Fuck , ”
72887	72897	72884	72884	he	2275	“ Why ca n’t I stay away from you ? ”
72926	72938	72939	72939	I	0	“ You really need to quit smoking . You smell horrible , ”
72942	72949	72939	72939	I	0	“ Never heard any complaints before . ”
72950	72958	72959	72959	I	0	“ They were all scared of you . ”
73114	73144	73145	73145	I	0	“ No one wants to put a mirror to your face because they know you wo n’t like what you see there . Everyone is afraid of your wrath , ”

73203	73212	73213	73213	I	0	“ I was never truly scared of you . ”
73228	73296	73213	73213	I	0	“ Not when I was seventeen and not a decade later . To me you ’ll always be beautifully misunderstood . And maybe I ’m an idiot to care , Sam . In fact , I probably am , but I still want you to quit smoking because I want you to grow old and gray and be healthy . Even if I can never have you . ”
73327	73332	73333	73333	Sam	278	“ Aisling , I — ”

74502	74516	74517	74517	Troy	123	“ You . Not knowing shit . You ’ve always been like this . ”
74529	74549	74517	74517	Troy	123	“ Took what you wanted , even if you had to set the world on fire in the process . ”
74550	74565	74566	74566	I	0	“ It ’s called being a go - getter . Not a bad thing , ”
74581	74591	74592	74592	Sparrow	122	“ That depends on how you look at it , ”
74597	74608	74592	74592	Sparrow	122	“ It might be a very bad thing for you . ”
74609	74617	74618	74618	I	0	“ Cut the riddles , Dr. Seuss . ”

74687	74712	74676	74676	his	123	“ is that what you want might end up not wanting you back if you slaughter everything on your way to get to it . ”
74713	74721	74722	74722	Sparrow	122	“ Do you know what you want ? ”
74739	74742	74732	74732	her	122	“ Yes , ”
74751	74760	74743	74743	I	0	“ I want you both to fuck off . ”
74761	74777	74778	74778	she	122	“ No , Sam . You think you want revenge . But what you want … ”
74785	74795	74783	74783	her	122	“ … what you really want is completely different . ”
74796	74819	74820	74820	I	0	“ Even if I wanted the things you think I want , getting them would ruin everything . I ’m a monster , ”
74855	74877	74878	74878	She	122	“ If a monster can be made , it can be unmade , too . Good night , my darling boy . ”
74941	74951	74952	74952	I	0	“ I do n’t want Aisling , you fools . ”

75142	75147	75122	75122	He	171	“ Mother , I — ”
75148	75155	75156	75156	she	169	“ I did n’t do it ! ”
75166	75213	75156	75156	she	169	“ You believe me , do n’t you ? It was n’t me . I swear . Not the poisoning . Not the cufflinks . I mean , heavens , Aisling , we both know how obsessed he is with those cufflinks . I would never ! ”
75214	75219	75220	75220	I	0	“ I believe you , ”
75252	75272	75226	75226	I	0	“ But I ’m going to need some time to get to the bottom of all this . Okay ? ”
75273	75284	75285	75285	She	169	“ You must help me , Aisling . You must . ”
75395	75401	75402	75402	I	0	“ Get up , Mother . ”
75432	75437	75438	75438	she	169	“ I ca n’t , ”
75441	75459	75438	75438	she	169	“ Oh , Aisling , this is such a nightmare . I need something for my nerves . ”
75486	75566	75480	75480	I	0	“ I ’m not prescribing you anything , Mother . I ’m not a psychiatrist . You need to see a professional who will assess you . Besides , you should adopt some coping mechanisms . Bad things happen to everyone . Life is about rising to the occasion , any occasion . Think of life as a garden . You do n’t choose where to be planted , but you can only choose whether to bloom or wither . ”
75567	75610	75611	75611	She	169	“ Oh but , Ash , it is hard to bloom in the storm . All I need is a little pick - me - up . I even have a list of things that might help . It ’s right here . ”
75640	75679	75630	75630	I	0	“ That ’s a lot of pills . Some of them are strong . Zoloft . Prozac … you can not mix them together , and you definitely ca n’t consume alcohol if you take any of them . ”
75754	75764	75765	75765	She	169	“ You have n’t taken any , have you ? ”

75793	75807	75808	75808	Jane	168	“ Just get me the medicines and get to the bottom of this . ”
76053	76099	76100	76100	I	0	“ I need to get to work . Please get yourself in the shower and brush your hair . Maybe go on a walk or see friends . You need to start taking care of yourself , Mother . I wo n’t live here forever . ”
76110	76118	76119	76119	She	3887	“ No one has asked you to ! ”
76131	76159	76119	76119	She	3887	“ And go , why do n’t you . Go when I need you . Just do n’t come crying at my grave when you lose me . ”
76200	76214	76215	76215	I	0	“ I ’m calling your psychiatrist as soon as I get to work , ”
76237	76246	76228	76228	he	2371	“ You can be mean , you know ? ”
76257	76263	76247	76247	She	3887	“ Just like your father . ”
76264	76270	76271	76271	I	0	“ I ’m not mean . ”
76278	76284	76285	76285	She	3887	“ But I am tired . ”
76502	76559	76479	76480	Dr. Doyle	302	“ You know , Aisling , you ’re a brilliant young doctor . You should find a residency and start next year . Tell your future employer you took a gap year to spend some time with your family or to do some traveling . This clinic is no place for someone as promising as you . ”
76560	76566	76567	76567	I	0	“ I like working here . ”
76603	76626	76594	76594	I	0	“ We ’ve already been through this , Greg . You know why I ’m doing this . This is my calling . ”
76627	76649	76650	76650	he	2386	“ And I appreciate your life experience has brought you here . I ca n’t help but feel guilty , too … ”
76662	76691	76657	76657	his	2386	“ … such medical talent should n’t be wasted in some underground , illegal clinic . You are a Harvard graduate , Fitzpatrick . Top of the crop . ”
76692	76701	76705	76705	him	2386	“ How long have you felt this way ? ”
76712	76716	76717	76717	he	2386	“ Long enough , ”
76745	76763	76764	76764	I	0	“ Please do n’t shackle yourself in unearned guilt . You are much too pragmatic for that . ”
76805	76815	76816	76816	he	2386	“ We ’ll talk about it some other time , ”
76819	76843	76844	76844	I	0	“ Fine , but if you think you ’re getting rid of me so easily , you have another thing coming , Greg , ”
76850	76856	76844	76844	I	0	“ Close the place up ? ”
76888	76909	76910	76910	he	2386	“ Actually , I have to run . A patient just paged me . Mind locking up before you leave ? ”
76916	76921	76922	76922	I	0	“ Not at all ! ”
76928	76945	76922	76922	I	0	“ Go ahead . It ’s been a moon and a half since I closed shop . ”
77056	77080	77043	77043	You	0	“ Too late , Nix . I know you ’re in there . Your car is parked directly in front of the doorway . ”
77131	77176	77111	77111	Sam	278	“ We can do this the nice way or the not - so - nice way . But you should know , my not - so - nice ways include smashing doors down , rummaging through places , and doing very dangerous fucking things . ”
77177	77182	77111	77111	Sam	278	“ Go to hell . ”
77183	77201	77111	77111	Sam	278	“ Ca n’t . Satan has a restraining order against me . Now open the damn door . ”
77202	77207	77208	77208	I	0	“ I hate you , ”
77222	77229	77208	77208	I	0	“ No , you do n’t . ”
77230	77234	77111	77111	Sam	278	“ I should . ”
77235	77245	77248	77248	I	0	“ No fucking shit , Sherlock . Open up . ”
77316	77321	77322	77322	he	278	“ You kill people , ”
77350	77388	77332	77332	He	278	“ I finally figured it out . Even though it was in front of me all this time , in plain sight . You kill people . That ’s what you do . Mercy killing . Euthanasia . ”
77438	77558	77421	77421	His	278	“ That ’s why you limit yourself to very few patients . That ’s why it ’s an underground operation . That ’s why you keep all the drugs you have in here . That ’s why you treat them at their homes . It all makes sense . You ’re not here to cure people , you ’re here to kill them . The only question is why ? Why are you , the sweet , caring Aisling Fitzpatrick , doing this ? Your brothers always told me you wanted to be an OB - GYN or a pediatrician . Something with babies involved , they said . The exact opposite of what you turned out to be . ”
77631	77638	77615	77615	I	0	“ You ca n’t prove it . ”
77639	77653	77686	77686	His	2404	“ I do n’t need to . You ’ll tell me your truth . ”
77654	77665	77666	77666	I	0	“ While you ’re keeping so many secrets from me ? ”
77674	77685	77666	77666	I	0	“ Nice try . Why are you here , Sam ? ”
77695	77761	77691	77691	he	2404	“ I find it hard to believe my job means so much to you . Whether I cure or kill people , it makes no difference to you . You owe me nothing , and your job is not to watch over me . In fact , it is the very opposite — to stay away from me . So why are you pushing this ? ”
77784	77835	77766	77766	He	2404	“ I do n’t fucking know , Aisling . I have no idea what keeps bringing me back to you , but I ca n’t seem to stop , and you do n’t seem to mind , so let ’s just get this out of our system and fuck already . ”
78089	78092	78093	78093	he	278	“ Goddammit , ”
78210	78224	78225	78225	I	0	“ I sincerely hope you do n’t intend to ask me to stop . ”
78230	78237	78225	78225	I	0	“ No . Do n’t stop . ”
78238	78267	78268	78268	His	278	“ You know , growing up , I never played kiddie games . I graduated from formula to guns without a pit stop at toy cars and puzzles . ”
78299	78307	78289	78289	he	278	“ Want to play doctor and patient ? ”
78329	78340	78341	78341	His	278	“ All right . Open up for me , Nix . ”
78370	78383	78384	78384	He	278	“ Glove up first , Doc . First drawer on your left . ”
78451	78458	78459	78459	he	278	“ I ’m new at this , ”
78470	78490	78464	78464	his	278	“ so you ’ll have to excuse me in advance as I conduct this pap smear , Miss Fitzpatrick . ”
78491	78498	78464	78464	his	278	“ Please , call me Nix . ”
78499	78509	78510	78510	he	278	“ Sorry , I do n’t treat Knicks fans , ”
78564	78591	78543	78543	I	0	“ My name has nothing to do with the basketball team . It ’s after an enticing female monster . Does that put you at ease ? ”
78592	78595	78543	78543	I	0	“ Definitely . ”
78630	78638	78639	78639	he	278	“ You might experience some discomfort here , ”

78680	78686	78677	78677	he	278	“ control yourself , please . ”
78687	78692	78693	78693	I	0	“ S - sorry , ”
78743	78746	78747	78747	I	0	“ Oh ! ”
78750	78764	78747	78747	I	0	“ Still ca n’t get to that right angle . Better try again . ”
78836	78848	78849	78849	I	0	“ H - how did you learn how to do this ? ”
78880	78891	78868	78868	his	278	“ You look like you know what you ’re doing . ”
78892	78901	78902	78902	I	0	“ Got accepted to premed after high school . ”
78922	78927	78917	78917	he	278	“ You ’re serious . ”
78964	78969	78970	78970	He	278	“ Dead fucking serious . ”
78990	78998	78977	78977	he	278	“ You thought about becoming a doctor ? ”
79002	79054	78999	78999	I	0	“ Hell no . I made a bet with a friend I could get into premed . Did n’t study for it either . But I read a gynecology book on one of my train rides to New York City while attending an arms deal and got the gist of it . ”
79098	79103	79104	79104	Sam	278	“ Always so dramatic , ”
79140	79173	79120	79120	he	278	“ Sorry , Miss Fitzpatrick , but I could n’t find what I needed . This might be a little unorthodox , but I think I know how to finish this exam . ”
79253	79256	79257	79257	I	0	“ Merde , ”
79260	79270	79271	79271	he	278	“ I fucking love it when you say that , ”

79583	79587	79576	79576	his	278	“ Believe it . ”
79595	79610	79576	79576	his	278	“ Because I doubt you can do this with anyone else at this point . ”
79611	79615	79576	79576	his	278	“ Shut up . ”
79616	79674	79687	79687	He	278	“ You know it ’s true . That ’s why you could n’t have sex with that woman at the ball , who looked exactly like me . You know what you want , Sam ? You just do n’t want to take it because the consequences would mean you ’d lose my daddy ’s fat paycheck . ”
79675	79686	79687	79687	He	278	“ I do n’t give a fuck about your daddy . ”
79707	79743	79697	79697	anyone	510	“ Then what is it ? Please do n’t tell me you actually convinced yourself you are bad for me . You do n’t have a conscience , and I can make my own decisions . ”
79744	79749	79785	79785	he	278	“ Shut . Up . ”
79750	79754	79755	79755	I	0	“ Make me . ”

80100	80104	80105	80105	I	0	“ Get out . ”
80111	80120	80105	80105	I	0	“ Now . And do n’t come back . ”
80143	80170	80130	80130	himself	278	“ Lighten up , Nix . I heard you when you said you were on the pill . I just like to see you getting pissy . ”
80171	80195	80216	80216	He	278	“ Well , congratulations , you succeeded . You think it ’s okay to tell a woman what to do with her body ? ”
80196	80202	80203	80203	He	278	“ Depends on the woman . ”
80206	80209	80203	80203	He	278	“ Out ! ”

80252	80256	80257	80257	He	278	“ Or what ? ”
80263	80283	80257	80257	He	278	“ You ’ll call the police to come and pick me up from your unregistered death clinic , Nix ? ”
80284	80319	80320	80320	I	0	“ Or I will tell my brothers you ’ve screwed their baby sister twice now , despite getting … oh , what is it , an extra million just to stay away from me ? ”

81157	81321	81154	81154	her	115	“ My governess . Her name was Ms. Blanchet . She died when I was seventeen . On the night I met you , actually , at the carnival . I drove there after I found her . She had cancer . Lung cancer . She battled it for three years . The last few months , she spent in a hospice but then decided she wanted to die at home and not in a strange place around people she did n’t know and meant nothing to her . So she moved back to her apartment in the West End . She was sick , Sam . So very sick . She could n’t eat , or breathe , or laugh without feeling pain . She started peeing in her bed at night , voluntarily , after she ’d woken up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom one time and fell in the hallway , breaking her hipbone . “
81396	81477	81385	81385	she	2447	” There was a pause . Silence hung in the air . Reluctantly , I grabbed a fistful of her dress and pulled her in , shutting the door behind us . My penthouse was the only apartment on the floor , but I still did n’t want to take any chances of anyone listening to this . We left the groceries outside . Aisling twisted her fingers together , staring at her feet , determined to finish her confession . “

81600	81684	81685	81685	She	2454	” I said tersely , but she and I both knew it was bullshit . Life did n’t care about your age , bank account , or circumstances . Life just happened . I was thirteen when I assumed my role as Troy ’s successor . I ’d crushed skulls , put bullets in people ’s heads , tortured , killed , manipulated , and kidnapped people . Because life happened to me , and to stay alive , I had to adapt . “
81704	81758	81692	81692	She	2454	” Aisling stood there , by my door , tears streaming down her face . I made no move to console her . It was n’t what she needed in that moment , even an emotionally stunted dirtbag like me could see it . She had to get this confession off her chest . “
81803	81811	81812	81812	She	2457	” she said pointedly , eyeing me . “

82078	82122	82076	82076	Nix	210	” I said , my voice gravelly . Suddenly , I forgot about being sick . I forgot about existing in general . Her pain took over the room and everything else ceased to exist . She shook her head , laughing bitterly . “
82179	82236	82170	82170	I	0	” The carnival where I snatched her first kiss simply because she was too sweet not to take advantage of . Where she saw me taking a life . Aisling saw two dead people in less than twelve hours after living a too - sheltered life . It must have been a shock to the system . “

82303	82325	82294	82294	You	0	” She looked up at me for confirmation , her eyes swimming with tears . I gave her a curt nod . “
82342	82373	82334	82334	I	0	” Except for when I touch you … then I become a pussy - ass dipshit with a fever who ca n’t keep a damn meal down . She nodded . “

82412	82416	82407	82407	You	0	” I challenged . “
82419	82420	82407	82407	You	0	” “
82558	82620	82555	82555	I	0	” She sniffed . I got it . All of it . Why she did what she did . How she had become who she was . A Nix . A gorgeous vision of a woman , hiding an enchanting monster underneath . But I did n’t agree with her . She was n’t put on this earth to kill people . “
82625	82630	82555	82555	I	0	” I asked softly . “
82666	82706	82707	82707	I	0	” I said nothing . I ’d never truly loved anyone , so it did n’t seem like I could contribute to that observation . She stepped toward me , the fog of death and mourning around her evaporating . “
82974	82975	82976	82976	He	302	” “
82980	83022	82976	82976	He	302	” I said , staring her dead in the eye . Nix nodded , walking briskly in the kitchen ’s direction , popping cabinets open , taking out a chopping board then walking back to the door to retrieve her groceries . “
83117	83159	83115	83115	Sam	278	” She collected the carrots , the celery , the chicken thighs , and the broth , chopping the vegetables and meat on the board and tossing them all into a pot for what I assumed was a chicken noodle soup . “
83261	83262	83265	83265	your	0	” “
83269	83348	83265	83265	your	0	” I asked , propping my forearms on the kitchen island between us , intrigued . I ’d met many killers in my lifetime , but all of them were like me . Decadent and soulless . Selfish and cruel . They all did it for the bloodthirst . Not for altruistic reasons . Even those who had moral codes broke them often . What Aisling did had nothing to do with what I did for a living . “
83448	83469	83437	83437	we	2511	” She put the pot of soup on the stove , turning up the heat , lost in her explanation . “
83554	83555	83557	83557	you	2521	” “
83565	83569	83557	83557	you	2521	” I said . “
83572	83590	83557	83557	you	2521	” She put a lid on the chicken soup , tearing open a bag of egg noodles . “
83606	83607	83557	83557	you	2521	” “
83617	83618	83611	83611	you	2521	” “
83639	83640	83620	83620	I	0	” “
83644	83658	83620	83620	I	0	” I trailed off . She bounced on her toes , looking sideways . “
83667	83668	83671	83671	Ash	156	” “
83673	83687	83671	83671	Ash	156	” I planted my forehead over the kitchen island , relishing its coolness . “
83697	83701	83688	83688	You	156	” She sighed . “
83729	83730	83726	83726	I	0	” “
83744	83777	83778	83778	Cillian	154	” I raised my head , pinning her with a look . Of course she knew that . Aisling was n’t stupid . She tilted her chin up , ignoring my words . “
83824	83825	83815	83815	I	0	” “
83830	83844	83828	83828	me	0	” I slammed my open palm against the marble between us , losing patience “
83873	83874	83868	83868	You	156	” “
83888	83912	83885	83885	you	156	” Nix perched her purse on the counter and took out a thermometer , sauntering over to me and sticking it under my tongue “
83926	83963	83915	83915	you	156	” I glared at her like she took a shit in my bed , waiting for the thermometer to beep . When it did , I spat it out back into her hand , and hissed , “
83970	83971	83915	83915	you	156	” “
83974	83999	83915	83915	you	156	” she snorted , rounding the kitchen island and taking a few pills from her purse , reaching over to hand them to me . “
84022	84030	84031	84031	I	0	” Eyeing her skeptically , I said , “
84053	84079	84038	84038	you	193	” She shrugged , about to withdraw her outstretched hand . I snatched the pills , shoving them into my mouth and swallowing without water . “
84108	84286	84095	84095	you	193	” Kicking her out was n’t going to fly . Not when I could barely crawl to the door , let alone shove her out of it . And anyway , I was tired of fighting her off . She ’d finally succeeded in worming her way into my life . I saw a distinction between her and Gerald . Between her and her brothers . Nix was finally her own person in my eyes . And what a person that was . Gorgeous , intelligent , and compassionate . Worst of all — someone who was blindly in love with me . She did n’t have to spell it out . It was radiating from every inch of her silken flesh . I did n’t deserve her . I could have her if I wanted . I staggered to the couch and fell onto it . Nix balanced herself on the edge , right beside me , looking at me expectedly , like Rooney anticipating story time . I ran my fingers through my damp hair . “
84291	84292	84095	84095	you	193	” “
84301	84304	84095	84095	you	193	” Rascal . “
84314	84315	84305	84305	I	0	” “
84347	84368	84095	84095	you	193	” Eyeing her with new fondness I was n’t even entirely sure I was capable of feeling , I chuckled . “
84432	84433	84421	84421	I	0	” “
84443	84463	84464	84464	You	0	” She ran her fingers through my hair , fixing whatever the hell I did to it , smiling . “
84504	84505	84497	84497	I	0	” “
84517	84522	84497	84497	I	0	” I pointed out . “
84537	84538	84528	84528	Cillian	154	” “
84545	84546	84539	84539	They	65	” “
84551	84555	84539	84539	They	65	” She sighed . “
84563	84587	84561	84561	Nix	210	” She smiled , dipping her hand into the bullet jar wistfully , slipping in the missing bullet she ’d stolen from there . “
84591	84599	84589	84589	you	0	” I croaked , closing my eyes . “
84609	84714	84539	84539	They	65	” I drifted off to sleep , even though I tried hard to stay awake . It reminded me of the first few Christmases I spent with the Brennans . The fight against exhaustion was like swimming against the stream , but something good was happening , and who the fuck knew when would be the next time I ’d feel this elusive , intoxicating joy ? Aisling must ’ve slept right beside me because I could still feel her heat when I woke up . Her scent of ginger and honey and my fucking undoing . I yawned , stretching on the couch . “
84718	84763	84539	84539	They	65	” I growled , but there was no response . I opened my eyes , looking around . There was a bowl of steaming chicken noodle soup by my side , a bottle of water — uncapped — and some pills . Aisling was gone .
84902	84932	84933	84933	Barbara	313	“ But I need to make sure it ’ll be worth my while . I ’ll only do it for the right price . Can I borrow a cigarette ? ”
85085	85114	85073	85073	Barbara	313	“ How do you know I ’ll even get a book deal ? There is n’t exactly a shortage of women Gerald Fitzpatrick has dipped his dick into . ”
85120	85171	85115	85115	She	313	“ True , but you are the only one who ’d lived in one of his apartments . You were n’t just a fuck , you were a mistress . He flew you places . Bought you expensive jewelry . I bet it ’s just the tip of the iceberg . ”
85201	85276	85186	85186	She	313	“ Oh , did he ever . Samuel , my boy , he adored me . Of course , I did my part , too . There were orgies . Massive orgies . He sometimes took us three at a time . I always thought it was peculiar Ger was so upset when his son , Hunter , did it . After all , he was the king of orgies back in the day . ”
85303	85307	85308	85308	I	0	“ What else ? ”
85311	85325	85308	85308	I	0	“ There were drugs . A whole lot of them at those parties . ”
85409	85417	85418	85418	She	313	“ There were also a few abortions . ”
85423	85508	85509	85509	She	313	“ Gerald did not like to use protection , but he also did n’t want any bastard children . He was actually adamant about that , as you could imagine . I , myself , knew better than to tempt fate . I was always on the pill . Did n’t have the ambition of getting knocked up with a billionaire ’s kid . Too dangerous . Looking back , maybe I should ’ve . Maybe I ’d fare better than I do today . ”
85543	85571	85572	85572	She	313	“ But I was privy to everything that happened behind the scenes . He was a monster , Samuel . A real monster . Ever met one ? ”
85609	85612	85613	85613	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
85617	85689	85613	85613	I	0	“ I ’ve met monsters before . Multiple times , actually . So , here ’s how we are going to do this , Barbara . I ’ll bring the lucrative tell - all book deal , you ’ll bring the juice . But whatever happens , you must remember one thing — you never met me , never saw me , and never heard of me . Am I clear ? ”
85710	85719	85720	85720	I	0	“ Absolutely . May I have another cigarette ? ”
85740	85751	85720	85720	I	0	“ Sure , sweetheart , take the whole fucking pack . ”
85938	85941	85920	85920	I	0	“ Mother ? ”
85983	85986	85987	85987	I	0	“ Mother ? ”
86073	86075	86047	86047	my	0	“ successful ”
86151	86154	86138	86138	I	0	“ Mother ! ”
86275	86284	86285	86285	I	0	“ You need to get your stomach pumped , ”
86305	86311	86296	86296	I	0	“ What have you done ? ”
86482	86485	86486	86486	Pers	260	“ Hello ? ”
86494	86499	86500	86500	I	0	“ Oh . Hi , ”
86513	86538	86500	86500	I	0	“ It ’s Ash . I ’m trying to reach Cillian , but he is not answering . Any idea where he might be ? ”
86539	86548	86549	86549	she	260	“ Hey , Ash . Is everything okay ? ”
86566	86603	86563	86563	she	260	“ Kill is at Badlands with Sam , Devon , and Hunter . It ’s some kind of a special gambling night . I was n’t paying attention . Can I help you in any way ? ”
86781	86806	86807	86807	she	169	“ Just do n’t tell your father . He ’d think it ’s about him , and he does n’t need the ego boost , ”
86819	86845	86807	86807	she	169	“ Do you think they have Netflix here ? Oh , this is so highly inconvenient for me . I have a facial tomorrow morning . ”
86861	86867	86846	86846	I	0	“ You ’re an idiot . ”
86902	86906	86907	86907	Her	169	“ Excuse me ? ”
86921	86926	86912	86912	She	169	“ You heard me . ”
86946	87001	87002	87002	I	0	“ You ’re an idiot . A selfish one at that . You refuse to get the help you need , and you abuse prescription drugs to get back at … who , exactly ? The only person you are hurting is yourself . Now let me tell you what ’s about to happen … ”
87025	87091	87002	87002	I	0	“ I ’m going to go back home , leave you here on your own , and empty all your cabinets of drugs . Any drugs . You wo n’t even have an Advil for your morning migraines . Then I ’m going to book you an appointment with a therapist . If you do n’t go , I ’m moving out of the house . ”
87092	87095	87096	87096	Mother	169	“ Aisling ! ”
87099	87108	87096	87096	Mother	169	“ How dare you ! I would never — ”
87109	87112	87113	87113	I	0	“ Enough ! ”
87116	87204	87113	87113	I	0	“ I do n’t want to hear it . I ’m tired of mothering you all day , every day . Of holding your hand through life . Of being the parent in our relationship . You know , I grew up seeing you and Da shipping off Cillian and Hunter to boarding schools in Europe and was terrified of sharing their fate . There was nothing I feared more than saying goodbye to you and Athair . Now , I am actually jealous of my brothers , ”
87209	87275	87205	87205	I	0	“ because you gave them the best gift of all . They grew up barely knowing you and liking you very little . They are not attached to you like I am . They can live their lives , do as they please , free from the chains of loving two people who are incapable of loving anyone else but themselves . I ’m done ! ”
88152	88164	88165	88165	He	155	“ Holy shitballs , sis . Way to make an entrance . ”
88196	88225	88165	88165	He	155	“ Do you have some blow ? I do n’t use drugs anymore , but if you have a side hustle , I ’d like to financially contribute . ”
88226	88229	88230	88230	Cillian	154	“ Aisling , ”
88242	88258	88230	88230	Cillian	154	“ What are you doing here , besides the obvious , which is embarrassing yourself ? ”
88259	88263	88264	88264	I	0	“ Great question , ”
88272	88440	88264	88264	I	0	“ Well , brother , I started my day off at six am , worked a long shift , came back home to find our mother passed out in her own puke , then proceeded to shove my fingers down her throat and usher her to the hospital to ensure she did n’t overdose on chewable vitamins or whatever it was she decided to cram into her stomach . At this point , I tried to call my dear brothers , but both of them were too busy playing cards to pick up the phone . You did n’t even answer our emergency code word , even though I ’ve never used it in my life before , so it should have tipped you off about the situation . Our mother is fine , by the way . But I ’m not . I ’m tired and in need of a shower and fed up with carrying the burden of gluing this family together all by myself . ”
88478	88491	88492	88492	he	278	“ Everybody out . Family business . Phil , Jonathon , Archie … ”
88497	88518	88519	88519	Sam	278	“ … take it to room three , and get everyone a complimentary drink . Not from the vintage menu . ”
88578	88595	88596	88596	I	0	“ Wow . You mean you ’re not going to kick me out of your club ? ”
88600	88610	88596	88596	I	0	“ If you show up tomorrow , I will . ”
88620	88643	88611	88611	He	278	“ Right now you seem to be doing a fine job ruining your own evening . No need for me to interfere . ”
88644	88650	88651	88651	I	0	“ You ’re an asshole , ”
88655	88664	88651	88651	I	0	“ And you sound like a broken record . ”
88665	88681	88682	88682	Cillian	154	“ Cut this out , both of you . Start from the beginning , Ash , ”
88696	88710	88682	88682	Cillian	154	“ What happened ? Since when has Mother been dabbling with prescription drugs ? ”
88711	88715	88716	88716	I	0	“ Since forever . ”
88724	88732	88718	88718	my	0	“ She is a cutter , too . ”
88740	88801	88733	88735	Both my brothers	2648	“ Bet you did n’t know that either , huh ? She mainly does this for attention , to keep Da and me on our toes whenever she thinks we do n’t pay her enough attention . There ’s a lot you do n’t know . I ca n’t do this all by myself . Our family is falling apart . ”
88802	88805	88806	88806	Cillian	154	“ I — ”
88832	88851	88824	88824	I	0	“ And you did n’t even pick up the phone when I called you ! You ghosted me . ”
88852	88859	88860	88860	Cillian	154	“ We did n’t ghost you , ”
88864	88877	88860	88860	Cillian	154	“ We put our phones aside and did n’t see your texts . ”
88878	88908	88824	88824	I	0	“ Even if you did n’t ghost me tonight , you ’ve ghosted me our entire lives , letting me live this nightmare of tending to our mother alone ! ”
88909	88912	88913	88913	Hunter	155	“ Sis , ”
88926	88949	88913	88913	Hunter	155	“ we had no idea . It was n’t like we ignored the situation on purpose . You were our blind spot . ”
88950	88953	88954	88954	Cillian	154	“ Yeah . ”
88966	89023	88954	88954	Cillian	154	“ Mother and Athair always seemed on the unhinged side , but you have to remember we ’ve never actually lived under their roof . Not since toddlerhood , anyway . We thought it was under control . That you were the one taking advantage of the perks of staying at home and not vice versa . ”
89024	89032	89033	89033	I	0	“ Staying at home is a nightmare ! ”
89057	89098	89049	89049	Sam	278	“ Mother is a master manipulator . I draw her baths , drive her places , act as a messenger between her and Da . I ’m basically her maid , and I do n’t want to do this anymore . ”
89099	89106	89107	89107	Cillian	154	“ You do n’t have to , ”
89111	89151	89107	89107	Cillian	154	“ We ’ll come up with a plan . I will go to the hospital and stay with Mother tonight . Hunter , you ’ll take over tomorrow . Aisling needs some space from her for the time being . ”
89155	89176	89152	89152	Hunter	155	“ Do n’t worry , sis , we got this . You do n’t have to do this alone anymore . ”
89246	89255	89256	89256	I	0	“ I just need to clear my head , ”
89260	89300	89256	89256	I	0	“ Her overdose was to get back at me . I ’m afraid if I give her what she wants — more attention — it’ll defeat the purpose of strong - arming her into getting the help she needs . ”
89341	89346	89347	89347	Hunter	155	“ You ’re right , ”
89350	89382	89347	89347	Hunter	155	“ We do n’t want you near her . We ’ll let her know it ca n’t carry on like this . Now that we ’re in the picture , too . ”
89383	89392	89393	89393	Sam	278	“ I ’ll give Aisling a ride home . ”
89411	89421	89401	89401	I	0	“ No , thanks . I ’m parked outside . ”
89422	89437	89438	89438	Hunter	155	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m saying this , but Sam ’s right . ”
89445	89483	89438	89438	Hunter	155	“ You ’re in no condition to drive . Pick the car up tomorrow morning . Your body must be flooding with adrenaline . Try to take it easy tonight . We ’ll tackle this clusterfuck tomorrow . ”
89484	89506	89507	89507	Devon	232	“ It ’s a clusterfuck indeed . Which reminds me — now ’s a great time to ask for a raise , ”
89538	89548	89507	89507	Devon	232	“ The Windsors draw less attention than you lot . ”
89549	89556	89557	89557	Cillian	154	“ Hands to yourself , Brennan , ”
89564	89572	89557	89557	Cillian	154	“ Remember your paycheck comes with stipulations . ”
89573	89582	89583	89583	Sam	278	“ Your neck does , too , Fitzpatrick . ”
89622	89628	89629	89629	he	278	“ How are you feeling ? ”
89663	89666	89667	89667	I	0	“ Fine . ”
89672	89678	89667	89667	I	0	“ Just tired . Overstimulated . ”
89679	89701	89667	89667	I	0	“ Stay at my place . I have a spare bedroom and zero fucked - up parents living under my roof . ”
89702	89723	89724	89724	I	0	“ And I have two brothers who ’d kill me if they find out I spent the night with you . ”
89787	89803	89804	89804	Sam	278	“ A dead Aisling would make life easier for me . The offer still stands , ”
89807	89825	89804	89804	Sam	278	“ Charming , but I ’ll pass . I do n’t go where I ’m not welcome . ”
89826	89830	89831	89831	he	278	“ Since when ? ”
89837	89841	89831	89831	he	278	“ Since always . ”
89848	89866	89831	89831	he	278	“ For your information , you ’re the only person to bring the crazy out in me . ”
89867	89878	89879	89879	He	278	“ Dangerous dick tends to do that to good girls . ”
89889	89901	89879	89879	He	278	“ I had no idea things were that bad at home . ”
89968	89974	89948	89948	Sam	278	“ They were n’t always , ”
89980	90058	89948	89948	Sam	278	“ There had been ups and downs . Being the backbone of the family was n’t so bad when the posture of our skeleton was n’t terrible . The last weeks were the worst , though . Ever since the media picked up the story of Da ’s stupid affair , things began deteriorating . Then the poisoning happened and the mysterious threatening letters . The heirloom cufflinks were the cherry on top of the crap cake . ”
90136	90139	90140	90140	Sam	278	“ Shit , ”

90417	90428	90429	90429	He	278	“ You ’re going to get yourself killed . Drive ! ”
90488	90492	90493	90493	he	278	“ You okay ? ”
90496	90501	90493	90493	he	278	“ I ’m fine . ”

90700	90704	90683	90684	My parents	552	“ Not anymore . ”
90705	90719	90672	90672	I	0	“ They ’re trying to kill you because you took over their territory ? ”
90720	90775	90797	90797	he	2693	“ Conquered , fair and square . If they find you in my car , they ’ll have a merry good time milking your daddy for money . But they ’ll gang - rape and torture you first . Which is why you need to stay the fuck down and let me handle this . ”
90952	90959	90960	90960	Sam	278	“ You can come up now , ”
91053	91061	91062	91062	I	0	“ Are you going to shoot him ? ”
91065	91089	91062	91062	I	0	“ Only cowards shoot people in the back , Nix . I ’ll shoot him in the face . Respectfully , of course . ”

91455	91524	91525	91525	He	2722	“ I did n’t want to do this . I begged them not to . He was … I was … my father , I mean , put a gun to my head . I could n’t say no . I could n’t . You know what it ’s like with dads like him . You know . You have one , too . You ’re a Brennan . ”
91548	91560	91561	91561	Sam	278	“ You fucked up . Now it ’s time to pay , ”
91565	91568	91569	91569	I	0	“ No ! ”

91821	91856	91857	91857	Sam	278	“ You have one thing going for you , and that is that I do n’t want the fucking headache that comes with the territory of blowing your brains out in front of her . ”
91903	91967	91968	91969	The teenager	2728	“ But I ’m sending you with a message and a souvenir . The message is as follows : tell Vasily that I am going to have his head on a plate if he as much as tries to breathe in my direction again . Last time , I cut his face . Next time , I am going to decapitate him completely . ”
91974	91984	91985	91985	He	2728	“ W - w - what ’s the souvenir ? ”
92005	92032	92001	92001	Sam	278	“ This one is something to remember me by . A farewell . A reminder . A warning . Are you left or right - handed ? ”
92049	92054	92043	92043	He	3883	“ Right - handed . ”
92076	92112	92113	92113	Sam	278	“ Here . This ’ll ensure you ’ll be a crappy aim for the rest of your life and choose a different occupation . In case you ’re thinking of finishing your daddy ’s job … ”
92138	92148	92124	92124	he	2731	“ Thank you for sparing my life , sir . ”
92212	92236	92237	92237	He	278	“ Never interfere with my business again , Aisling , and never , ever show your face when we bump into my enemies . ”

92312	92321	92293	92293	He	278	“ They ’ll think you ’re my weakness . ”

92337	92345	92346	92346	he	278	“ Very astute of you , Einstein , ”
92349	92366	92346	92346	he	278	“ But I ’ve never been seen with women before . They ’ll jump to conclusions . ”
92367	92377	92378	92378	I	0	“ Is that why you wo n’t marry Becca ? ”
92381	92391	92378	92378	I	0	“ Because you wanted to spare her precious life ? ”
92392	92403	92404	92404	He	278	“ First of all , who the fuck is Becca ? ”
92412	92417	92404	92404	He	278	“ Are you serious ? ”
92426	92438	92439	92439	He	278	“ Becca is the woman you took to the charity event . ”
92500	92508	92509	92509	he	278	“ I thought her name was Bella , ”
92512	92515	92516	92516	I	0	“ Nope , ”
92519	92556	92516	92516	I	0	“ At any rate , yes , part of the reason why I ’d never take a wife is because watching an innocent woman die because of me is not on my to - do list . ”
92557	92563	92564	92564	I	0	“ Sparrow did n’t die , ”
92568	92614	92564	92564	I	0	“ Troy was a fixer . A mostly good guy doing bad stuff . I ’m an underboss . An all - around monster . I dabble in many things and have enough blood on my hands to fill up your Olympic - sized pool . ”

92680	92685	92686	92686	Sam	278	“ The Brennan cabin . ”
92709	92719	92686	92686	Sam	278	“ A nice reprieve for you from your family . ”
92720	92723	92724	92724	I	0	“ Yeah … ”
92731	92741	92742	92742	Sam	278	“ … I already feel so much more relaxed . ”
92765	92771	92772	92772	I	0	“ You saved me tonight , ”
92815	92818	92819	92819	I	0	“ Why ? ”
92822	92831	92819	92819	I	0	“ Because you ’re my boss ’ daughter . ”
92832	92841	92842	92842	I	0	“ You do n’t care about my father , ”
92845	92881	92842	92842	I	0	“ True . But I do care about his money . I ’m on the fast track to becoming one of the richest men in Boston . Keeping you protected is in my best interest . ”
92882	92892	92893	92893	I	0	“ So it had nothing to do with me , ”
92906	92947	92948	92948	I	0	“ None whatsoever , Nix . I would do the same for Hunter . For Cillian . Even for your deranged mother . You are business to me , sweetheart . With a side of pleasure every now and again . ”
93240	93251	93252	93252	Sam	278	“ I ’ll see what we have in the fridge , ”
93331	93341	93342	93342	Sam	278	“ You ’ll have to settle for something canned , ”
93345	93349	93342	93342	Sam	278	“ Refried beans . ”
93350	93360	93361	93361	I	0	“ I do n’t know how to make them . ”
93386	93400	93380	93380	Sam	278	“ You do n’t know how to heat a can of refried beans ? ”
93401	93412	93413	93413	I	0	“ I ’m guessing you do it without the can . ”
93423	93430	93431	93431	he	278	“ You made me chicken soup , ”
93439	93483	93435	93435	I	0	“ Ms. B had taught me how to make it . It ’s the only thing I know how to make because it was the only thing she could keep down when she was sick . I ca n’t even make an omelet . ”
93667	93686	93687	93687	I	0	“ The heating is not working properly . I think at this point , it ’s a given . ”
93744	93757	93758	93758	he	278	“ My apologies . There ’s a Waldorf Astoria across the road , ”
93761	93778	93758	93758	he	278	“ Very funny . Thanks for the ride home , by the way . Highly appreciated , ”
93825	93831	93832	93832	His	278	“ Stop being a brat . ”
93839	93851	93852	93852	I	0	“ Why ? It ’s exactly what you expect from me , ”
93855	93890	93852	93852	I	0	“ Admit it . You think the worst of me and my parents . And while I suspect you do n’t hate my brothers , you are far from the realm of respecting them . ”
93918	93957	93898	93898	Sam	278	“ Master bedroom is the first door to your right . Do n’t bother trying to seduce me in the middle of the night . I fucked you out of my system and do n’t need a repeat . ”
94435	94446	94425	94425	he	278	“ Fine . I ’ll fuck you one last time . ”
94461	94471	94472	94472	He	278	“ Romeo , oh Romeo , wherefore art thou ? ”
94542	94596	94538	94538	her	2788	“ This ’ll be the last time , Fitzpatrick . A farewell . There ’s a reason why your brothers pay me extra not to touch you , and you just got a taste of it tonight . I ’ll make your life a living hell and a short living hell at that . ”
94597	94608	94609	94609	He	278	“ Newsflash , Sam , you ’re already doing that . ”
94755	94758	94759	94759	he	278	“ Well ? ”
94767	94777	94759	94759	he	278	“ Am I going to stand here for long ? ”
94826	94832	94833	94833	he	278	“ What are you doing ? ”
94836	94922	94833	94833	he	278	“ I ’m tired , Sam . Tired of you . Tired of us . Tired of this cat and mouse game . There ’s only so much push and pull I can tolerate before it gets repetitive and abusive . You want me ? You ’ll have to get me . The hard way . I ’m going to run , and you are going to catch me . If you do n’t , you ’ve missed your chance . How about them apples ? ”
94999	95007	95008	95008	he	278	“ You ’re not roaming the woods , ”
95012	95030	95008	95008	he	278	“ You ca n’t tell me what to do , Brennan . You ’re the hired help , ”
95178	95205	95173	95173	he	278	“ I do n’t fucking think so , Nix . You do n’t get to call me the help and live to tell the tale unharmed . ”
95396	95411	95412	95412	I	0	“ You ca n’t harm me more than you already have , you fool . ”
95423	95449	95412	95412	I	0	“ Unfortunately , I ’d never be able to hurt you the way you hurt me , but at least I can stop loving you . ”
95450	95459	95460	95460	he	278	“ Do n’t be so sure about that , ”
95497	95517	95486	95486	He	278	“ You want to hurt me ? Go ahead . You should know where my carotid is , Doc . ”
95558	95570	95552	95552	His	278	“ Now be a good monster and kill me , Nix . ”
95650	95655	95656	95656	I	0	“ I ca n’t ! ”
95659	95789	95656	95656	I	0	“ I ca n’t hurt you , no matter how much I hate you . And I do hate you . Because I love you . I love you and you treat me like garbage . What do you want me to say ? That I ’m jealous of your dreams because you belong to them at night ? Because I am . I can not breathe , eat , or blink without thinking about you , Sam Brennan . You ’ve conquered every inch of me before you ’d even touched me . After you did , things got worse . Way worse . I ’ve always loved you , Monster , but the more I get to know you , the more I wish I did n’t . ”
95877	95893	95861	95861	he	2810	“ Rape ? That ’s the only thing you have n’t done to me yet , ”
95922	95930	95917	95917	He	2810	“ You think I ’ll rape you ? ”
95945	95956	95942	95942	his	2810	“ I know you will , if you enter me , ”
95963	95974	95959	95959	my	0	“ because I do n’t want you to touch me . ”
95975	95988	95959	95959	my	0	“ Then what the fuck was that love declaration a second ago ? ”
95989	96093	96094	96094	I	0	“ A confession , not an invitation , you moron . I do n’t trust you . I do n’t know what you want from me . I ’m not even sure what part you play in my life . My father is MIA . My mother is an addict and a cutter . My brothers left me with this mess . And the only thing I know for sure is that the person I ’ve been pining for over a decade does n’t want me back but is willing to play with me whenever it tickles his fancy . I ’m done . ”
96099	96111	96096	96096	my	0	“ Let me go . I do n’t want this anymore . ”
96162	96167	96168	96168	he	2814	“ You ’re serious , ”

96313	96316	96317	96317	I	0	“ Yes , ”
96325	96354	96317	96317	I	0	“ Leave me alone . Do n’t show up at my clinic anymore and do n’t steal kisses from me when we see each other at family functions . ”
96355	96366	96367	96367	He	2814	“ Why ? Because I do n’t love you back ? ”
96426	96494	96495	96495	I	0	“ No . I can handle it if you do n’t love me back . But I wo n’t accept indifference , humiliation , and unstableness . I am not your plaything . The little teenybopper who stared at you with starry eyes at a carnival . Those days are over . I deserve respect and consideration , and you know what ? I changed my mind . ”
96517	96607	96495	96495	I	0	“ Yes . I do n’t want to have sex with you anymore because you do n’t love me back . Is that bad ? Immature ? Anti - feminist ? I expect love . I want it all , so if you do n’t intend to give it to me , I suggest you leave me be or I am going to tell my family how you dipped your hand into the honey jar , tasted the forbidden sweetness , then came back for third and fourth helpings . ”
96608	96618	96687	96687	He	2817	“ I told you I will never settle down . ”
96619	96629	96630	96630	He	2817	“ Then that means you are letting me go . ”
96661	96686	96687	96687	He	2817	“ Love is not a price I am willing to pay for pussy , no matter how tight and aristocratic . Goodbye , Aisling . ”

97348	97408	97345	97345	his	123	“ Time for a quick and efficient K.O. , Sam . I will not sit here and watch you destroy a perfectly good family just because you have a boner for Gerald ’s blood . Do n’t forget your sister ’s marriage and happiness is on the line , too . You are taking this God complex too far . ”
97409	97431	97432	97432	I	0	“ There ’s nothing complicated about my godly gift to distribute pain . I ’m merely giving Gerald what he deserves . ”
97440	97443	97432	97432	I	0	“ He — ”
97444	97471	97472	97472	Troy	123	“ Yes , I know . Killed your unborn brother . Made your mother leave you behind . No one is propositioning Gerald Fitzpatrick for knighthood . ”
97483	97538	97474	97474	his	123	“ Yet here you are , alive and fucking well , much to the Bratva ’s chagrin . This means whatever damage he inflicted on you did n’t finish the job . So why do n’t you get it over with , give him the final blow , call it even and move on ? ”
97671	97677	97678	97678	I	0	“ I want a confession , ”
97681	97708	97709	97709	Troy	123	“ And I want to fuck my wife ten hours a day . Guess what ? Looks like we ’re both not getting what we want , ”
97712	97740	97741	97741	Troy	123	“ What makes you think Gerald is willingly going to come to you and tell you all about how he fucked your mother then fucked you over ? ”
97752	97957	97746	97746	his	123	“ Grow the fuck up , Sam . Your story does n’t add up , and frankly , with each passing day , I ’m starting to think there ’s more to this than you ’re letting on . You ’ve never given a damn about Cat , and yes , she left you , but she ’d tried to contact you and you shut her down without a blink of an eye . It ’s not the first time you ’ve been wronged by one of your clients . You are a pragmatic person . You take things in stride . This is a part of you I do n’t know and do n’t care to discover . Emotional , messy , and above all — strategically faulty . You are about to make some pretty grave mistakes if you are not careful . I can see it . Be upfront with Gerald or drop it altogether . But this is the last prank you pull on him . Your sister is married to his son , and now that Hunter and Cillian are watching their mother and paying attention , they ’ll be on your tail in no time . You understand ? ”
97958	97963	97964	97964	I	0	“ Are you done ? ”
98020	98056	98057	98057	He	123	“ Because if so , you know where the fucking door is . I ’m sorry the student outdid the master , but sometimes , old man , that ’s just the way it is . ”
98312	98317	98318	98318	Gerald	124	“ Busted , kiddo . ”
98320	98339	98340	98340	he	2852	“ Now get into the car , nice and easy . I ’ll take the passenger ’s seat , ”
98363	98376	98355	98355	I	0	“ Do you even know how to use a gun , Gerry ? ”
98377	98384	98385	98385	He	2852	“ Do n’t call me Gerry . ”
98393	98432	98385	98385	He	2852	“ My name is Gerald . You ’re the only person to call me Gerry , and I despise it . I only let you get away with it because I thought it was a term of endearment . ”
98433	98438	98439	98439	I	0	“ You were wrong , ”
98442	98485	98439	98439	I	0	“ Tell me about . In the car . Now . No funny business . I will shoot to kill , Brennan . You ’ve left me with nothing . Not my family , not my business , and not my pride . ”
98654	98716	98717	98717	I	0	“ Put the gun down , Gerry . I ’ll take us to your apartment , but not because you ’re threatening me with a gun . I can grab it from you blindfolded with my arms tied behind my back . I ’ll come willingly because I ’m interested in what you have to say and how much you know , ”
98738	98745	98746	98746	he	2858	“ B - b - bullshit ! ”
98749	98759	98746	98746	he	2858	“ You will do as I say because I — ”

98884	98894	98895	98895	He	2858	“ You will do as I say , goddammit ! ”
98962	98966	98967	98967	I	0	“ Where to ? ”
98970	98988	98967	98967	I	0	“ The penthouse . The one Hunter and Sailor lived in before moving into their own house . ”
99120	99131	99108	99108	I	0	“ You may continue with your meltdown now , Gerry . ”
99182	99204	99205	99205	Gerald	124	“ You ’ve been caught , Sam Brennan . I set a trap for you , and you fell for it , ”

99228	99233	99225	99225	I	0	“ Care to elaborate ? ”
99250	99345	99247	99247	he	2858	“ When you asked me to give you a list of all the women I ’d had an affair with , I got suspicious . It seemed farfetched , and as time went by and you dragged your feet about my little problem , I got even more suspicious . You ’d never failed a mission I ’d given you before , and suddenly , you did n’t have as much as a lead . I could n’t understand why you left me to drown . Then the poisoning happened . And the cufflinks … ”
99346	99371	99372	99372	I	0	“ Christ , Gerry , I was there when all of this happened . Get to the juicy part . My time is precious . ”
99389	99414	99384	99384	He	2870	“ Aisling made me do it . She told her mother and me what to do , that way we could know for sure . ”
99415	99421	99422	99422	I	0	“ Made you do what ? ”
99457	99534	99448	99448	I	0	“ Plant a bug . A mole . A trap . See , Aisling said that the only way to outsmart you is to beat you at your own game . Together , we found a woman from my past — Barbara McAllister , in this case — and had her assist us . We knew if you contacted her , that would mean that you were after my throat and not those who harmed me . ”
99599	99603	99604	99604	I	0	“ The newspaper — ”
99663	99669	99661	99661	Motherfucker	4077	“ The headline was fake . ”
99746	99749	99750	99750	He	2873	“ Quite . ”
99763	99840	99750	99750	He	2873	“ I did n’t believe Aisling when she said you were probably a double agent , so I came to see you a few times at Badlands . Each time , I turned around , losing my nerve . But I noticed the same newspaper was rolled and left at the entrance each time , so I figured that was your media outlet of choice . From there , faking a headline was n’t too hard . ”
99874	99958	99959	99959	Gerald	124	“ Now , Barbara McAllister is a college friend . She is not at all what you believed her to be . But for the purposes of helping me , she put on a show . Her sister has an address in a shithole part of the city . I added her name in the lease , knowing you would find her , see the poverty she so - called lives in , and decide to press her because she is easy prey , ”
99962	100000	99959	99959	Gerald	124	“ Aisling said that if I gave you information that did n’t match what you ’d find on your own , it ’d raise a red flag and you ’d take the bait . She was right . ”
100001	100013	100044	100044	he	2881	“ Did you decide to do all this or did Ash ? ”
100068	100096	100064	100065	his son	4272	“ Well , Aisling did , bless her heart . She is my child through and through , that one . So delicately cunning . So smart . ”
100126	100263	100110	100110	Gerald	124	“ Aisling knew Barbara would stand out with her zip code . We wanted to ensure you ’d approach her , so we made certain her address led to a trailer park . You took the bait . When you called Barbara , Aisling and I instructed her beforehand . What to say . How to act . We could n’t chance her blowing her cover . She did a remarkable job , did n’t she ? And by the end of the day , you were already on the phone with publishing houses and literary agents , hooking her up with people who wanted to hear her story about the sordid Gerald Fitzpatrick . The new Jeffrey Epstein , right ? The fall from grace of the tycoon who wanted too much from too many . ”
100349	100360	100361	100361	I	0	“ We got three offers from three different publishing houses , ”
100495	100505	100506	100506	Gerald	180	“ You did n’t get an offer from anyone . ”
100511	100525	100508	100508	his	180	“ Your calls to the publishers went straight to Emmabelle Penrose ’s phone . ”
100564	100639	100558	100558	Gerald	180	“ Aisling did n’t want you to recognize her voice . She had your calls redirected to Emmabelle ’s phone each time you made an inquiry . And once the so - called contract between Barbara and the publishing house of her choice was signed , you were out of the loop . You only ever saw the contract . You did n’t actually speak to any of the people Barbara had spoken to . ”
100685	100695	100696	100696	I	0	“ How did Ash redirect the calls to Belle ? ”
100730	100733	100734	100734	Gerald	180	“ Yes , ”
100747	100767	100740	100740	I	0	“ She used the man who knows how to be Sam Brennan better than Sam Brennan — Troy Brennan . ”
100859	100948	100949	100949	Gerald	180	“ If it makes you feel any better , your adoptive father had no idea this had anything to do with you . He would never betray you like this . Aisling told him she needed a few certain numbers to be redirected to Belle because , as you know , Belle is the owner at Madame Mayhem , a local nightclub , and she said someone was trying to target the club and write a damning tell - all about the managers and goings - on inside , ”
101003	101008	101009	101009	I	0	“ It was airtight , ”
101013	101016	101009	101009	I	0	“ Yes , ”
101020	101067	101017	101017	Gerald	180	“ Aisling did all the leg work . When Troy asked why she did n’t come to you directly to deal with the publishing companies , she explained that because she was infatuated with you , she wanted to limit your communication to the bare minimum . ”
101077	101082	101083	101083	I	0	“ We communicate often , ”
101101	101120	101083	101083	I	0	“ If that ’s what you want to call it . So where is this Barbara woman now ? ”
101279	101286	101287	101287	Gerald	180	“ That ’s a great question . ”
101377	101437	101365	101365	Barbara	313	“ I wanted to be here just to say I was sorry in person . I never meant to complicate things for you , Mr. Brennan , but Gerald is an old friend , and when he told me he was in trouble , I simply could n’t turn my back on him . Surely , you can understand . ”
101479	101485	101486	101486	She	2905	“ Well played , madam . ”
101524	101537	101538	101538	he	180	“ So now it ’s your turn to tell me … why ? ”
101561	101611	101549	101549	He	180	“ Why did you put me through this ? Why did you take everything I ’ve ever cared for ? What did I ever do to you , Brennan ? Up until two months ago , I would name you as one of my closest business partners . Openly . ”
101659	101665	101666	101666	I	0	“ I found the letters , ”
101678	101742	101666	101666	I	0	“ Catalina ’s letters . Back in November . The old bat finally conked out , and her neighbor invited me to sort through her shit and see if there was anything of value there . Spoiler alert : there was n’t . But she kept the letters to you . The ones you redirected back to her . And your photos together … ”
101748	101796	101743	101743	I	0	“ … and the pregnancy test . I know all about what you did to her , to me . How you drove her away from me . How you killed the child in her womb . My brother . I know everything . Everything . Everything . ”
101877	101883	101884	101884	He	180	“ You bought that bullshit ? ”
101887	101894	101884	101884	He	180	“ Are you serious , son ? ”
101895	101937	101884	101884	He	180	“ There were pictures , Gerald . Lots of them . Of you and Cat together . By the way , you should probably stop the habit of documenting every single fuck you have with women who are not your wife . ”
101979	102053	102054	102054	He	2910	“ No , I did have an affair with Cat , I ’m not going to deny that part . Hell , Sam , you were a child , barely even old enough to wipe your own ass . I did n’t know you . And Cat was a gorgeous woman in her prime . Besides , she needed the money , and I paid her well for her … uh … company . ”
102100	102224	102093	102093	He	2910	“ I had an affair with her , yes , but everything else was a complete and utter fabrication . Catalina was never pregnant with my child , and I never raised a finger to hurt her . I did not cause her to miscarry . When we started seeing each other , she told me she had her tubes tied after she had you . I asked her to show me the doctor ’s note — I knew Jane would rip my head off if I ever got any of my mistresses pregnant — and Cat provided it to me within the day . Not only that , but I went ahead and double - checked it with her OB - GYN . ”
102225	102235	102093	102093	He	2910	“ Then what the fuck was that pregnancy test ? ”
102236	102304	102305	102305	I	0	“ My guess is she took it from one of her friends . Catalina had a lot of friends in the … uh … industry she worked in . Kept women who messed around with rich men . We provided for them , but the main incentive was , of course , to fall pregnant with our children . That would tie us to them for life . ”
102313	102326	102327	102327	I	0	“ So you are saying she was never pregnant with your child ? ”
102344	102347	102336	102336	He	2914	“ Correct . ”
102348	102410	102411	102411	Gerald	124	“ That ’s all nice and well , but I distinctly remember Cat coming back home around the time of the alleged miscarriage , disoriented and bruised . I remember her crawling into her bed , curling up into a ball , crying . I remember her being ushered to the hospital in an ambulance . How would you explain that ? ”
102428	102437	102422	102422	his	2914	“ Does the name Donnie ring a bell ? ”
102444	102608	102438	102438	I	0	“ Tall , muscular , an underwear model type . He was Cat ’s real boyfriend at the time . The man she fucked without leaving an invoice on the nightstand afterward . Real good - looking guy , I ’ll give him that , but he never came to terms with what she did for a living . Every now and again , he would rough her up if she showed up to meet him smelling like the man before him . As it happened , that man before him that night was me . I know , because I met your mother at the hospital and even paid for her hospital stay . I told her to press charges . She did n’t want to . I still have the receipt for that hospital bill , and I can show you none of the things listed there have anything to do with Cat ’s womb or any of her reproductive organs . ”
102667	102686	102656	102656	He	331	“ Hey , Cat ’s kid , bring me the pack of Marlboros over there , will ya ? ”
102720	102737	102707	102708	The man	625	“ Here , boy , take one . I ’ll show you how it ’s done . ”
102738	102744	102707	102708	The man	625	“ I do n’t smoke . ”
102745	102770	102707	102708	The man	625	“ Oh , you will , buddy . With your fucked - up life , cigarettes are a question of when , not if . ”
102771	102776	102777	102777	I	0	“ Explain the letters . ”
102834	102839	102840	102840	Gerald	124	“ Easily , Sam . ”
102869	103129	103130	103130	I	0	“ Sometime after Donnie roughed her up , Cat realized her line of work was just too dangerous . She asked me for money . A lot of it . To keep silent . I said no , and that ’s when the blackmailing began . Each and every one of her letters was part of an extortion scheme . She threatened to out us , to spread terrible lies , to ensure Jane knew about what we were . What we did . She wanted to skip town , but she never wanted to take you , Sam . You were n’t in her plans . Not even for a second . At some point , I realized she was n’t worth the heat I was about to get from Jane . I became open to giving her money . I kept asking her how she could leave you behind . Tried to convince her to take you with her — kids need their mothers . By God , Sam , she just would n’t . Finally , I handed her 150k just so she would shut up and leave me alone . I remember the day she left . She was so happy , and you know what , son ? So was I. She almost cost me everything . I ’m not going to lie , Sam , seeing the back of your mother as she skipped town was one of my favorite sights . It should have been a happy day for you , too . ”
103151	103163	103164	103164	I	0	“ You never told me about your history with my mother , ”
103168	103279	103164	103164	I	0	“ No . Not because I did something horrible to her but because I did n’t want you to think I see you as the spawn of this money - grabbing idiot . I did n’t want our professional relationship to be tainted by that . Besides , I truly did n’t and do n’t see you as Cat ’s . You are a Brennan through and through . A Brennan is the best thing a person in Boston can be , other than a Fitzpatrick . You had a good childhood once she gave you up . You should n’t be thinking about her . Not for one second . ”
103280	103285	103286	103286	I	0	“ I do n’t , ”
103289	103299	103286	103286	I	0	“ I ’m thinking about how you wronged me . ”
103300	103307	103308	103308	Gerald	124	“ I did n’t know you , ”
103311	103445	103308	103308	Gerald	124	“ You were a kid . Still , I felt some sort of responsibility toward you . After I ’d heard Cat had left , I looked you up . Found out that Sparrow sent you to this fancy Montessori school . I had my driver drive around it sometimes to see if I could spot you during recess . Sometimes I did . You sat in the middle of a circle , and all the boys looked up to you , captivated by you . You became strong , and prominent , and unbeatable . After a while , I was satisfied with how it all turned out . Pleased with my decision to give the wretched woman what she wanted to leave you behind . It worked out well for you . ”
103446	103458	103286	103286	I	0	“ So well you later on hired me as the help . ”
103459	103466	103467	103467	Gerald	124	“ No , as my fixer , ”
103470	103559	103467	103467	Gerald	124	“ A savvy businessman whose expertise I needed and was willing to pay for handsomely . Admittedly , I was n’t surprised to see you on my doorstep . I stitched together the Sailor and Hunter plan with Troy , tightening our ties with the Brennans had always been the plan for me . You were too prominent a family in Boston for me not to acknowledge you somehow . But I hired you because you were the best in the business and not for any other reason . ”
103622	103671	103613	103613	his	2919	“ But I have a feeling this does n’t have much to do with Catalina and me . You wanted a reason for me to become your enemy . Otherwise , you would have come straight to me with those letters . What ’s going on , Sam ? ”
103899	103930	103931	103931	I	0	“ You deprived me of my mother , Gerald , and I deprived you of your sanity for weeks . I think it is high time we cut a deal . ”
103944	104036	103931	103931	I	0	“ Do n’t turn this around on me , Brennan . You were caught red - handed , meddling with my business and ruining my relationships with my loved ones . I know it seems like Jane and I have a lot of issues to work through , and truth be told , ours is less than a perfect marriage , but I still care about my wife . I love her in my own way , and I am definitely not impressed with the way you interfered in our marriage . ”
104037	104123	104124	104124	He	2929	“ Regardless of that speech , the truth of the matter is , I have a lot of dirt on you , Gerry boy , and I fully plan to unleash it if I do n’t get what I want . The letters are still real . The pregnancy test is still in existence . All those things you ran away from with Cat are now in my possession , and trust me , I make my birth mother look like a kitten in comparison . ”
104132	104140	104124	104124	He	2929	“ What is it that you want ? ”
104141	104145	104146	104146	I	0	“ Your daughter , ”
104175	104233	104234	104234	he	2929	“ You ’ll never stand a chance with my daughter after what you did to us . This is the ultimate betrayal . She cares for her mother dearly , and in her eyes , you are to blame for the destruction of her family . In fact , I will be meeting her for breakfast in … ”
104242	104268	104234	104234	he	2929	“ … about two hours to tell her all about this little conversation . I can not give you what is not up for offer . ”
104269	104276	104277	104277	I	0	“ Leave the persuasion to me , ”
104280	104290	104277	104277	I	0	“ Give her your blessing to be with me . ”
104291	104295	104296	104296	he	2929	“ My blessing ? ”
104304	104311	104300	104300	his	2929	“ You tried ruining my life ! ”
104312	104318	104319	104319	I	0	“ You ruined mine first . ”
104334	104346	104347	104347	He	2929	“ I ’m paying you extra to stay away from Aisling ! ”
104367	104382	104364	104364	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about my bank account . I ’ll survive without it . ”
104383	104400	104401	104401	He	2929	“ It ’s not your bank account I ’m worried about . It ’s my daughter . ”
104412	104421	104401	104401	He	2929	“ How well off are you , anyway ? ”
104422	104436	104364	104364	I	0	“ Triple digit millions well off . Your daughter will be provided for . ”
104437	104444	104445	104445	he	2929	“ You will not have her ! ”
104449	104465	104445	104445	he	2929	“ Aisling is beautiful , smart , delicate , and well - bred . She — ”
104466	104480	104481	104481	I	0	“ Is also fucking single because the only man she wants is forbidden , ”
104513	104533	104494	104494	I	0	“ You are doing her a disservice by interfering with her love life . She knows what she wants . ”
104534	104538	104539	104539	He	2929	“ And you ? ”
104548	104556	104539	104539	He	2929	“ Do you know what you want ? ”
104574	104596	104597	104597	I	0	“ You will tell her she has your blessing to date me . To be with me . To marry me , ”

104626	104634	104635	104635	he	2929	“ She is my flesh and blood , ”
104638	104644	104635	104635	he	2929	“ Do n’t remind me . ”
104650	104727	104635	104635	he	2929	“ Look , I do n’t need your dirty money . I plan on courting her and touching her — a lot , in ways you do n’t want to think about — and I would like to do that very openly . She deserves dinners , and restaurants , and vacations . Things I can not give her in secret . You either roll with the plan or I run you over . Your pick . ”
104728	104735	104736	104736	I	0	“ I have conditions , too . ”
104757	104763	104736	104736	I	0	“ Let ’s hear them . ”
104764	104820	104635	104635	he	2929	“ I ’ll be going back to Avebury Court Manor in a few to give Jane and Aisling a rundown of everything we discussed . All facts . You will not deny what happened . You will own up to tampering with our lives . To poisoning me . To dragging out those awful pictures . ”

105162	105194	105154	105154	Mother	169	“ Do n’t get me wrong , I appreciate all you did for us , uncovering all this , Aisling , but maybe this should ’ve been handled by the police . ”
105195	105219	105220	105220	Mother	169	“ Samuel Brennan would have slaughtered Da if he brought police officers into his club , and you and I both know it . ”

105530	105543	105558	105558	She	169	“ I feel awful , too . You were at the hospital . ”
105544	105548	105558	105558	She	169	“ I was . ”

105711	105729	105696	105696	He	171	“ It was him . The cufflinks . The poisoning . The pictures . Barbara , obviously . ”
105761	105764	105765	105765	Mother	169	“ Why ? ”

105845	105922	105923	105923	he	2949	“ I was wrong in forcing you and Samuel apart . I thought I was doing you a favor . To be honest , I still think I did . Your brothers and I knew you liked him from the moment you saw him , and we wanted someone better for you . You deserved nothing but the best . But if what you want is less than the best , if your heart desires Sam … ”
105940	106008	106009	106009	I	0	“ … you have my permission to be with him , honey . I will not stand in your way , and I will not pay Sam an extra fee not to touch you . You are free to do as you please . Frankly , it ’s been a long time coming , considering you are showing signs of being the smartest person in the family . ”
106163	106211	106212	106212	I	0	“ That is very nice of you , Athair , and I appreciate you finally seeing the error in your ways , but I ’m afraid it does n’t matter anymore . I will not be touching Sam , dead or alive . Have a great morning . ”

106384	106393	106394	106394	Persy	233	“ Hey , girl ! We brought Vietnamese . ”
106405	106410	106411	106411	Sailor	130	“ And good spirits , ”
106431	106436	106437	106437	Belle	187	“ And sexual innuendos , ”
106445	106476	106477	106477	She	187	“ But first take a shower and join us in a pre - Christmas celebration . These bitches did n’t chain their husbands to their babies ’ cribs for nothing . ”
106558	106571	106555	106555	I	0	“ Are we celebrating something ? Did you finally sell Madame Mayhem ? ”
106634	106643	106629	106629	Belle	187	“ This has nothing to do with me . ”
106644	106650	106651	106651	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
106709	106768	106769	106769	she	187	“ I should ’ve been more observant , that ’s what happened . I ’m so sorry . This week , the penny finally dropped . Halloween night at Badlands when I left you alone there . Then Sam asking Sailor for your number . The way the two of you disappeared at Thanksgiving around the same time … ”
106773	106781	106782	106782	Sailor	130	“ Look , Aisling , we know , ”
106869	106878	106879	106879	Sailor	130	“ You ’re having an affair with him , ”
106883	106930	106879	106879	Sailor	130	“ With my brother . Sam Brennan . Underboss extraordinaire . The most ruthless man in Boston . I should have known . He ’d always refused to talk about you , but recently , he ’s become almost touchy every time your name comes up . ”
106953	106956	106957	106957	I	0	“ No , ”

107000	107032	106987	106987	Persy	233	“ And you do n’t need to lie to us . It ’s okay . God knows I did my fair share of chasing after Cillian when we first started out . ”
107037	107079	107080	107080	Belle	187	“ It ’s not the same . Cillian hounded you then forced you into marriage . The grain of want was always there . You helped it bloom into a magnificent garden , but he was a willing participant all throughout , ”
107104	107138	107080	107080	Belle	187	“ We ’re not going to sugarcoat it , Ash . We ’re worried about you . Sam Brennan is a more - than - you - can - chew type of guy . ”

107201	107215	107216	107216	Persy	233	“ Something we probably should have said to you a long time ago , ”
107267	107272	107273	107273	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
107276	107284	107287	107287	her	130	“ The evening we ’d met you … ”
107297	107440	107441	107441	Sailor	130	“ … remember when we all made a pact that we would only marry for love ? Not for money , not for power , not for fame , and not because it seemed like the safe thing to do . We only have eighty or so years on this planet , and it would be foolish to spend them with someone less than phenomenal . Well , it was your idea , which was why we thought it would be unfair to try to persuade you to stop pining after Sam . After all , you were going after your own heart . Doing as you preach . But … we had talks , Ash . And we all think that bet was not thought - through . Sometimes … well , sometimes it ’s not so bad to let go . ”
107601	107611	107612	107612	Sailor	130	“ And I love Sam with all my heart , ”
107615	107703	107612	107612	Sailor	130	“ I mean , how could I not ? He is my big brother , the boy who shooed the monsters away when I was a kid before becoming one himself . But I would never live with myself if I do n’t get this out of my system . Sam is incapable of love , Ash . And I think it is time for you to move on . You can not marry for love if you marry him because he is not the loving kind . ”
107704	107730	107731	107731	Persy	233	“ Not to mention , Sam does n’t want to get married . He says that all the time . Boasts about it , too , ”
107759	107767	107768	107768	I	0	“ I ’m not having an affair , ”
107788	107809	107781	107781	They	2980	“ Honey , I ’m not saying you ca n’t screw him out of your system a few more times . ”
107840	107861	107812	107812	her	187	“ Just make sure you know he is not your forever . You ’re a romantic one , like Persy . ”
107862	107870	107871	107871	Sailor	130	“ Yeah . Just guard your heart . ”
107875	107882	107871	107871	Sailor	130	“ You know ? Because love — ”
107883	107889	107890	107890	I	0	“ Yes , I know , ”
107899	107936	107890	107890	I	0	“ Love is not something your brother has to offer . So you ’ve mentioned . I suppose it does n’t matter if I repeat for the third time that I ’m not sleeping with him ? ”
107982	107987	107975	107975	Belle	187	“ Oh , honey . ”
108007	108035	108036	108036	I	0	“ Let me get this straight , you staged a whole intervention because you thought I was having an affair with Sam and could n’t handle him ? ”
108049	108058	108046	108046	Sailor	130	“ I would n’t say ca n’t handle … ”
108092	108109	108110	108110	I	0	“ All right , let ’s see about your green , green grass , shall we ? ”
108122	108221	108110	108110	I	0	“ Starting with you , the almighty Sailor , the first of us to get married . May I remind you your relationship started when you were Hunter ’s babysitter ? Because that totally happened . You were in charge of keeping him in line because his dick was not to be left unsupervised for longer than five minutes . I ’ve met toddlers with more self - control than Hunter ’s junk before he met you ; he was hardly marriage material . That did n’t stop you from jumping into commitment with him . And you … ”
108252	108335	108244	108244	she	233	“ You were literally bought by my brother , like cattle . Actually , scratch that , he conducts more research before he buys a steer . He ’d treated you horribly for months . You broke him the way you break an unruly horse . Through trials and tribulations . You should know better than anyone that the most stubborn mares make the best riding mates once you tame them . And , of course , there is you , Belle … ”
108376	108475	108479	108479	I	0	“ You can not even spell the word ‘ relationship , ’ let alone make one work . You are scared to death of love , for whatever reason , and have never once let anyone into your heart since I ’ve known you . Who are you guys to tell me where my relationship — or lack of it — is going ? You know better than anyone bumpy starts do n’t guarantee a terrible journey . In fact , the paths with the best scenery are the ones where you have to go through the mud . ”
108511	108520	108521	108521	I	0	“ I would like you to leave now … ”
108536	108540	108541	108541	Persy	233	“ … please . ”
108562	108567	108568	108568	she	233	“ You ’re right , ”
108571	108603	108568	108568	she	233	“ We have no idea what goes on between you and Sam . In our quest to try to protect you , we ’ve been pushing you around , belittling you . ”
108627	108642	108643	108643	Sailor	130	“ Reforming bad men seems to be the theme of our girl - gang . ”
108675	108690	108664	108664	she	2990	“ So I ’m really not sure why we ’re even worried about you . ”
108691	108700	108701	108701	Belle	187	“ You also happen to be annoyingly right . ”
108709	108768	108703	108703	her	187	“ We all have our ten - ton baggage . Our dark fears . The things that made us who we are today . So what if you ’re a one - man woman ? At least that man can wear the heck out of a pea coat , is tall as fuck , and richer than sin . ”
108769	108776	108777	108777	Sailor	130	“ Let ’s start this again , ”
108781	108823	108777	108777	Sailor	130	“ This time without the judge fest . Ash , would you like to spend an evening together ? Just eating junk , getting drunk , watching TV , and sharing tea that has nothing to do with the hot liquid ? ”
108852	108861	108842	108843	my friends	1689	“ I ’d like that , thank you . ”

109061	109080	109081	109081	Troy	123	“ You ’re welcome to join them , Hunter . No one is forcing you to be here , ”
109710	109736	109744	109744	she	210	“ Merry Christmas to you , too . I see you decided to gift me a crazy bitch this year . I ’ll take it . ”

109855	109879	109880	109880	I	0	“ Well , I thought it would be a good time to talk now , after you ’ve processed everything that ’s happened . ”
109908	109949	109951	109951	she	210	“ You mean you backstabbing my family and me , making my life a living hell , causing the very near wreckage of my parents ’ marriage , and bringing destruction upon us that would take decades to emotionally reconstruct ? ”
109957	109981	109951	109951	she	210	“ Grow the fuck up , Nix . I played with your daddy a little . It had nothing to do with you . ”
109982	110025	109951	109951	she	210	“ It had everything to do with me ! You hurt the people I love and care about the most , knowing how many issues I had with my mother and about her mental state , and you kept it from me . ”

Point is , I discussed it with your father . Most of it was n’t true , but some of it was . At any rate , that was why I wanted to torture him . ”

I know you are leery of them , but unfortunately for you , I am one . I will not accept anything short of a fairy tale , Brennan , even if it ’s with the monster in the story . ”

113128	113175	113118	113118	He	344	“ We do n’t need to go on dates . We ’ve known each other since before you were allowed to vote . I ’m picking up from where we left off after your little cabin stint , Aisling . I ’m not starting from scratch . ”

113223	113299	113220	113220	he	344	“ You want to move out . And you should . You are kissing thirty , Nix . Twenty - seven is no spring chicken . And your parents do n’t need a babysitter anymore . They ’re sorting their shit out , like they should have done three decades ago . Your mother is going to therapy . Your brothers told me . You ’re welcome for that little push , by the way . ”
113344	113365	113338	113338	he	344	“ First of all , they are attending therapy because you scarred them for life , not pushed them together . ”

113535	113575	113532	113532	He	344	“ I used to think that was true , too . Then I found out what you do here in this clinic . We are not so different , you and I. The only thing separating us is semantics . ”

I ’d close my eyes and it was you I ’d see . Then I ’d remember your family would destroy us if I had you . They would never let that fly . I would remember how I ’d fuck your life up if I touched you . If you became mine . If you were privy to all the blood I shed . I did n’t want to bring you into my mess , but now that I know that we ’re both screwed - up and imperfect , it changes things . ”

114080	114097	114027	114027	He	3057	“ You should have done it because you want to live to a ripe old age . ”
114098	114133	114134	114134	He	3057	“ Well , that might not be in store for me with my line of work anyway , but while I do live , I ’d rather do it with you by my side . ”

114282	114314	114278	114278	I	0	“ Because you want me , and when you want someone , you make sacrifices for them — and do n’t try to control them . Better get used to it . ”

We ’ve both lost people we loved very dearly in the most horribly painful ways , but it is not our fault . It is time to let go of the guilt , my dear . You can not change history . But you can write your next chapters . You are doing the right thing by quitting , Aisling . You have a beautiful life ahead of you . Ah , to be your age again , ”

I was n’t used to people being good under my roof . Your father and Cillian are cold as ice . Hunter has the best intentions , but I never quite could worm my way into his heart . You were my rock . My everything . And losing you … I could n’t imagine such a scenario . I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . I — ”

He was too old , too dangerous , and too rough around the edges for a gentle - bred girl like you . But yes , in the spirit of honesty , I knew a man like that could scoop you with the same frightening ease you ’d take Shelly out from her cage when you gave her baths . You were going to leave me all alone with your father in this big mansion , and I was n’t ready for that . With each year that passed , I tried mustering the courage to tell you . To come clean . Selfishly , I could n’t . ”

You are going to make it up to me , though . Big time . You can start by bringing all of us coffees and pastries . The Brennans have n’t eaten all day , and I ’m famished . ”
131158	131174	131175	131175	She	169	“ Will do . Right away . Oh , Aisling , thank you so much . ”
131183	131197	131198	131198	She	169	“ I will not let you down , love . You will see . ”

131692	131852	131853	131853	Sparrow	122	“ It was a close call . He is still not out of the woods yet . The main issue is n’t the shoulder wound . We removed the bullet , and although it ’s still early to tell , it is my belief that the bullet did not tear through more than muscle tissue and did not touch any of the nerves . Our main concern was the chest wound . It hit too close to home , to put it bluntly . In close proximity to the heart . It took us three hours to remove the bullet alone . He lost a lot of blood . The next twenty - four hours will be critical . We ’re moving him to the recovery room as we speak . He needs a good rest . I can not stress that enough . For that reason , we would prefer if he sees one visitor at a time . ”

He put up a good fight , I ’ll give him that , but I think you finally broke him . It ’s you he ’ll want to see when he opens his eyes . In fact , I am told by Troy that he specifically asked for you when he was rushed here . You should go . ”

Now I ’m asking you to bow out of the battle with the Bratva , Sam . No more bloodshed . No more . I do n’t deserve to become a widow because of your pride . Give up Brookline .

I had that before I set foot in your house . I wanted to be close to you , even if I hated not being able to have you . I visited your father on a weekly basis .

We were so wrapped up in our own shit , we never really stopped to consider what you were going through after your governess died . It did n’t help that you always looked like you knew what you were doing . The perfect daughter . ”
