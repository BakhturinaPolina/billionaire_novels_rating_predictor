12311	12340	12305	12305	she	438	“ We have internationals and magazines from floor twenty down . Floors thirty to forty are news and current affairs , and above forty are television and cable . ”
12345	12402	12305	12305	she	438	“ The two top levels of the building are senior management only , and your security card wo n’t get you up there . It ’s customary for new employees to be taken on a guided tour of the building , and Lindsey from human resources will come and get you at two o’clock this afternoon . ”
12403	12408	12409	12409	I	0	“ Okay , great . ”
12430	12459	12460	12460	She	441	“ Most people start on level four and work their way up the building , so congratulations for starting on level forty . That in itself is amazing . ”
12464	12468	12460	12460	She	441	“ Thank you , ”
12492	12498	12473	12473	She	441	“ This is your desk . ”

12592	12603	12604	12604	Frances	108	“ I ’ll leave you in Aaron ’s safe hands . ”
12607	12611	12604	12604	Frances	108	“ Thank you . ”
12612	12618	12619	12619	She	108	“ Have a great day . ”
12641	12646	12647	12647	Aaron	110	“ Are you excited ? ”
12650	12659	12660	12660	I	0	“ Oh my God , I ’m petrified , ”
12668	12686	12663	12663	I	0	“ I ’ve never done this job before . I usually find the stories with my group . ”
12691	12724	12687	12687	He	110	“ Do n’t worry ; we all felt the same when we started , but they would n’t have given you the job if they did n’t think you could do it . ”
12732	12743	12725	12725	I	0	“ I just do n’t want to let anyone down . ”
12756	12772	12749	12749	his	110	“ You wo n’t . This team is great , and we help each other . ”
12782	12785	12786	12786	He	110	“ Oh . ”
12796	12824	12791	12791	he	110	“ I ’m totally gay and way too touchy , apparently . Tell me if I get in your space . I have no sphere of reference . ”
12833	12836	12791	12791	he	110	“ Okay . ”
12847	12855	12837	12837	I	0	“ How long have you worked here ? ”
12856	12864	12865	12865	He	110	“ Four years . I love it . ”
12874	12890	12867	12867	his	110	“ Best job I ’ve ever had . I moved from San Fran for it . ”
12891	12897	12898	12898	I	0	“ I moved from California . ”
12902	12908	12909	12909	he	110	“ You here by yourself ? ”
12912	12915	12909	12909	he	110	“ Yeah . ”
12919	12934	12916	12916	I	0	“ I got a little one - bedroom apartment . I arrived on Friday . ”
12935	12943	12944	12944	he	110	“ What did you do all weekend ? ”
12947	12953	12944	12944	he	110	“ Freaked out about today . ”
12957	12968	12954	12954	He	110	“ Do n’t worry . We ’ve all been there . ”
12979	12987	12969	12969	I	0	“ Who else do we work with ? ”
12988	12991	12992	12992	He	110	“ Molly . ”
13000	13025	12992	12992	He	110	“ She does n’t start until nine thirty . She ’s a single mom and has to get her kids off to school first . ”
13033	13050	13051	13051	I	0	“ And Ava — she ’s just late because she probably went out last night partying . ”
13059	13083	13054	13054	He	110	“ She ’s a deplorable party girl , and she ’s never at her desk — always finds somewhere she has to be . ”
13084	13087	13092	13092	she	446	“ Hello , ”
13113	13118	13092	13092	she	446	“ I ’m Ava . ”
13126	13131	13119	13119	I	0	“ I ’m Emily . ”
13159	13176	13177	13177	Aaron	110	“ Open up your computer , Emily , and I ’ll show you through our programs , ”
13180	13183	13177	13177	Aaron	110	“ Okay , ”
13193	13200	13201	13201	Ava	112	“ Oh my God , Aaron , ”
13204	13214	13201	13201	Ava	112	“ I met the hottest fucking guy last night . ”
13215	13220	13221	13221	Aaron	110	“ Here we go . ”
13224	13234	13221	13221	Aaron	110	“ You meet the hottest fucking guy every night . ”
13245	13256	13243	13243	them	447	“ No , seriously , this time I mean it . ”
13299	13310	13287	13287	Aaron	110	“ At ten o’clock the stories will start coming in . ”
13315	13346	13287	13287	Aaron	110	“ We , as reporters , go through them and all say yay or nay as to whether it ’s got legs and if we go and report on it . ”
13350	13358	13347	13347	I	0	“ But how will I know that ? ”
13359	13373	13374	13374	Ava	112	“ We just vote yes for stuff that interests us , I suppose , ”
13377	13400	13401	13401	She	112	“ Obviously , news stories that are breaking are crucial , but it ’s the other content that they pay us for . ”
13406	13426	13427	13427	She	112	“ For example , three coffee shops have closed down in one week within two blocks from each other . ”
13432	13445	13446	13446	I	0	“ Honestly , who gives a fuck ? This is n’t news . ”
13449	13454	13455	13455	Aaron	110	“ Here ’s one . ”
13459	13501	13455	13455	Aaron	110	“ A driver has been clocked traveling at one hundred fifty - five miles per hour , and he ran a police stop sign . He was involved in a hot pursuit and ended up crashing into parked cars in Brooklyn . ”
13505	13512	13502	13502	Ava	112	“ Yeah , that ’s good . ”
13513	13520	13521	13521	He	110	“ We ’ll go with that . ”
13533	13540	13541	13541	I	0	“ So how does this work ? ”
13544	13628	13541	13541	I	0	“ We collect stories , and then we discuss collectively what each of us has done and put together a list of stories . You research your stories and have them in by four each day for the next day ’s news . Then we send them on to Hayden , and he sends them to editing . Obviously , if a good story comes in , it will take priority over everything else , and it will go to live news immediately . ”
13635	13649	13541	13541	I	0	“ So we each get our own stories and leads sent to us ? ”
13650	13662	13663	13663	I	0	“ Yes , by email . By others on this level . ”
13673	13690	13691	13691	Ava	112	“ We keep our finger on the pulse of what sells and what news really is , ”
13694	13702	13691	13691	Ava	112	“ It ’s the coolest job ever . ”
13713	13718	13719	13719	Aaron	110	“ Open your emails . ”
13740	13747	13719	13719	Aaron	110	“ Those are all possible stories ? ”
13751	13754	13755	13755	He	110	“ Yes . ”
13762	13775	13755	13755	He	110	“ Get reading , baby . They come in thick and fast . ”
13784	13810	13755	13755	He	110	“ Just make sure you get story details right . Nothing pisses management off more than incorrect names . You will get into huge trouble . ”
13811	13815	13853	13855	the kind voice	450	“ Got it . ”
13828	13852	13853	13855	the kind voice	450	“ Hi , Emily , this is Lindsey from human resources . I ’ll be up in about five minutes to get you , ”
13877	13883	13884	13884	I	0	“ Okay , thank you . ”
13888	13901	13902	13902	I	0	“ Oh no , I have to go on the office tour , ”
13908	13913	13914	13914	Aaron	110	“ That ’s okay , ”
13923	13931	13917	13917	he	110	“ I ’ve got so many leads , ”
13935	13942	13932	13932	I	0	“ I ca n’t keep up . ”
13943	13952	13953	13953	he	110	“ Do n’t worry . It ’s fine , ”
13957	13967	13953	13953	he	110	“ What if I miss a really important story ? ”
13968	13986	13932	13932	I	0	“ You won’t — it ’s fine . I ’ll go through yours while you ’re gone . ”
13987	13990	13932	13932	I	0	“ Really ? ”
13991	14008	13953	13953	he	110	“ Of course it is . You are n’t expected to know everything on day one . ”
14009	14021	14022	14022	Ava	112	“ Oh no , you have to go to the top . ”
14025	14031	14032	14032	I	0	“ What ’s the top ? ”
14035	14041	14032	14032	I	0	“ Upper - management offices . ”
14042	14048	13953	13953	he	110	“ They ’re not nice ? ”
14049	14070	14022	14022	Ava	112	“ No , they ’re fucking horrible , and you have a good chance of being fired on the spot . ”
14071	14074	14032	14032	I	0	“ What ? ”
14075	14080	14081	14081	Aaron	110	“ Oh , bullshit . ”
14086	14094	14095	14095	He	110	“ They just do n’t . . . ”
14106	14137	14101	14101	he	110	“ They do n’t fluff . If something is going to be said , they just say it how it is . They do n’t take any shit from anyone . ”
14138	14143	14144	14144	I	0	“ Who are they ? ”
14147	14168	14144	14144	I	0	“ Well , Mr. Miles wo n’t be there . He never is . I think he ’s in London . ”
14169	14173	14174	14174	I	0	“ Mr. Miles ? ”
14183	14187	14174	14174	I	0	“ The CEO . ”
14188	14221	14144	14144	I	0	“ Yes , I know who he is . I think everyone does . Although I ’ve never seen a picture of him . It ’s him and his brothers , right ? ”
14222	14240	14286	14286	Ava	112	“ Yes , it ’s the Miles family who owns everything . He and his three brothers . ”
14241	14248	14249	14249	I	0	“ And they ’re all upstairs ? ”
14272	14285	14286	14286	Ava	112	“ Just do n’t say anything stupid up in the management levels , ”
14293	14303	14286	14286	Ava	112	“ Like what ? What do they consider stupid ? ”
14311	14329	14286	14286	Ava	112	“ Just keep your mouth shut , take the tour , and do n’t tell HR anything . ”
14330	14334	14286	14286	Ava	112	“ Why not ? ”
14335	14377	14286	14286	Ava	112	“ Because they ’re on speed dial to the management levels . This whole tour you ’re taking now is just so they can do a personality assessment on you in the two hours it takes them to show you around . ”
14378	14383	14384	14384	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
14387	14399	14384	14384	I	0	“ Hi , Emily , is it ? I ’m Lindsey . ”

14514	14569	14495	14495	I	0	“ It ’s open from six in the morning until six thirty at night . It ’s busiest before work , obviously , but you can come here on your lunch break also . A lot of people take a late or early lunch so that it ’s not as busy when they come . ”
14611	14619	14620	14620	Lindsey	109	“ Okay , let ’s get going . ”
14623	14634	14620	14620	Lindsey	109	“ We will head up to the management floors now . ”

65144	65200	65201	65201	He	1311	“ No . I fought with you last weekend because I wanted to spend the day at my apartment , and you just assumed that your place was better than mine . Your money does n’t impress me , Jameson . I do n’t care for your fancy apartment . Mine is just as good . ”

88409	88445	88406	88406	she	122	“ It was good in theory , but come on . We both knew when we made the break that there was a big chance we would n’t make it through to the other side . ”

88655	88735	88652	88652	I	0	“ I ’m so busy that I ca n’t be there for you either . You deserve to be doted on , but I ca n’t do that from New York , Claud ; you know I ca n’t . There is no way around this situation . Our lives are traveling on different paths . Two CEOs ca n’t hold their careers and nurture a relationship from different sides of the world . It ’s an impossible task . ”

95162	95185	95186	95186	He	126	“ Jameson , doing this is in my mind holding hands in public and dating . Maybe meeting each other ’s families . ”
95193	95231	95189	95189	he	126	“ What ’s with the sudden change ? Last week you got angry with me for falling in love with you . I could n’t even look at you after sex without you getting upset with me . ”

95793	95820	95782	95782	He	1732	“ In my own way , I did . In hindsight , I realize that our relationship was never normal . Not like ours is anyway . ”

97892	97899	97900	97900	I	0	“ Why do you say that ? ”
97903	97911	97900	97900	I	0	“ He was fired from the Gazette . ”
97912	97916	97917	97917	Aaron	110	“ What for ? ”
97920	97946	97917	97917	Aaron	110	“ I do n’t know for certain , but the word on the street was that he was involved in a phone - tap scandal . ”

98002	98009	98011	98011	Aaron	110	“ Oh yes , the redhead , ”
98013	98019	98011	98011	Aaron	110	“ She ’s fucking hot . ”
98029	98039	98040	98040	Molly	111	“ Since when do you think girls are hot ? ”
98043	98059	98060	98060	he	110	“ I ’m gay , not blind . I can appreciate a fine female form , ”
98069	98080	98081	98081	Molly	111	“ Why do you think he ’s up to something ? ”
98113	98136	98137	98137	I	0	“ I told him one of my stories the other day , and I saw that he submitted it as his own , ”
98145	98149	98140	98140	Molly	111	“ Fucking snake . ”
98150	98159	98160	98160	I	0	“ I have no proof , of course , ”
98163	98176	98160	98160	I	0	“ I was just wondering about his character , that ’s all . ”

98251	98308	98246	98246	her	111	“ You know what , Aaron , stop playing the fucking victim here . You know he ’s sleeping around , and you ’re still sleeping with him . It ’s one thing to be deceived , but to willingly go back for more when you know exactly what is going on is just plain pathetic . ”

98328	98380	98381	98381	she	1763	“ Yeah , I do . You ’re acting like a damsel in distress . You do n’t have kids with him . You do n’t have a mortgage . You do n’t work with him . The break would be easy . Tell him to fuck off and move on , ”
98384	98396	98381	98381	she	1763	“ Breakups are hard . Staying with an asshole is harder . ”
98397	98412	98413	98413	I	0	“ Speaking of moving on — Jameson asked me to move in with him , ”
98432	98437	98420	98420	Aaron	110	“ What the hell ? ”

98488	98501	98502	98502	Molly	111	“ No , Aaron , fucking other people is n’t normal behavior , ”
98505	98521	98502	98502	Molly	111	“ Get that through your thick head . Your view on reality is seriously distorted . ”
98522	98536	98537	98537	Aaron	110	“ Fuck , you ’re a real bitch today , you know that ? ”
98540	98555	98556	98556	she	111	“ Well , that communal dick of your boyfriend ’s is pissing me off , ”

98610	98618	98607	98607	Aaron	110	“ He told me he loves me . ”
98619	98624	98625	98625	Molly	111	“ What the fuck ? ”
98628	98633	98625	98625	Molly	111	“ Are you serious ? ”
98634	98639	98640	98640	I	0	“ But . . . ”
98643	98647	98648	98648	Aaron	110	“ But what ? ”
98651	98662	98648	98648	Aaron	110	“ There should be no buts anywhere in this story . ”
98663	98678	98679	98679	I	0	“ It ’s all so fast . What ’s the rush , you know ? ”
98682	98691	98679	98679	I	0	“ I ’m scared he ’s just stressed . ”
98698	98722	98692	98692	They	1765	“ He told me that he ’s had feelings since we first met , and it ’s been coming for a long time . ”
98723	98729	98730	98730	Molly	111	“ That could be true . ”
98733	98738	98730	98730	Molly	111	“ It could be . ”
98744	98754	98739	98739	I	0	“ It could also be in his takeover strategy . ”
98755	98760	98761	98761	Molly	111	“ What takeover strategy ? ”
98764	98772	98773	98773	I	0	“ Jameson Miles gets what he wants , ”
98776	98785	98773	98773	I	0	“ If he ’s decided he wants me — ”
98786	98791	98792	98792	Aaron	110	“ Which he has , ”
98795	98807	98808	98808	I	0	“ He will make it happen . I do n’t know . ”
98811	98850	98808	98808	I	0	“ It just all seems too good to be true , and the whole Claudia situation has freaked me out a little . Can I really believe that Claudia and he will just break off all communication now ? ”
98856	98871	98872	98872	She	111	“ Here we go . Have you two idiots been sniffing ink cartridges today ? ”
98880	98916	98917	98917	She	111	“ Stop being a fucking negative bitch . If he did n’t tell you he loved you , that would have been a problem . Now that he has , he has an ulterior motive . ”
98925	98934	98935	98935	She	111	“ Will you two come back to Earth ? ”
98939	98946	98947	98947	She	111	“ We have to get back . ”
98961	98969	98970	98970	Aaron	110	“ She needs a good deep dicking , ”
98973	98981	98970	98970	Aaron	110	“ She ’s in full bitch mode . ”
98993	98999	98970	98970	Aaron	110	“ You could be right . ”
99152	99162	99163	99163	Jameson	126	“ Are you nearly ready , my fuck bunny ? ”
99190	99197	99166	99166	He	126	“ Jesus , you look beautiful . ”

105375	105413	105248	105248	He	135	“ Apparently — and honestly , I have no idea if this is true , but Molly said it was what circulated at the time — he was tapping Keely May ’s phone and stealing her stories . ”
105414	105417	105418	105418	he	135	“ What ? ”

105676	105682	105673	105673	Tristan	135	“ Are you fucking serious ? ”
105689	105707	105683	105683	He	135	“ But I do n’t know if I read it the wrong way or . . . , ”
105711	105736	105708	105708	I	0	“ I do n’t want to be making more of this than it is , but I felt that it was really quite off . ”

105809	105831	105789	105789	he	135	“ I did n’t say anything to Jameson because I feel like that ’s exactly what Gabriel wanted me to do . ”
105839	105847	105832	105832	Tristan	135	“ He wants to start a war . ”
105848	105865	105866	105866	I	0	“ That ’s what it felt like . . . there could be no other explanation , ”

106109	106153	106106	106106	he	135	“ Thanks , I ’ll get on this now . Can you do me a favor and try to find out as much about Hayden ’s personal life as you can ? Where he hangs out , partner , that kind of thing . ”

147891	147895	147933	147933	she	403	“ Proves what ? ”
147896	147903	147904	147904	I	0	“ That she ’s the one . ”
147907	147925	147904	147904	I	0	“ You know , ever since you were a tiny little boy , you ’ve done this . ”
147926	147930	147933	147933	she	403	“ Done what ? ”
147937	147963	147933	147933	she	403	“ When you were very little , maybe three or four years old , you used to have this little pale - blue pickup truck . ”
147967	147995	147933	147933	she	403	“ You loved it . It fit in the palm of your hand , and you always carried it around . It was your pride and joy . ”
148000	148070	147996	147996	I	0	“ The thing is , Tristan loved it too . He had his own , but yours was the special one . And even though you loved that truck with all of your heart , the moment that Tristan got upset about anything . . . you would give it to him . You could n’t stand seeing him upset , and you felt responsible to make him happy . ”
148074	148127	148071	148071	I	0	“ As you grew up , I watched you do this many times , Jameson , with many things . To the outside world you were aloof and cold , but for the ones you loved , you would do anything to make them happy . You have more heart than sense . ”
148133	148147	148128	148128	My	0	“ Why do you think that Emily would n’t be happy with you ? ”
148164	148176	148177	148177	I	0	“ Because eventually , I ’m going to let her down , ”
148184	148204	148180	148180	Her	2593	“ Jameson darling , how ? By working too hard ? By being too honorable to your family business ? ”
148210	148241	148180	148180	Her	2593	“ I ’m in love with a man just like you , Jameson . You know him well , your father . He , like you , is a workaholic . ”
148242	148248	148249	148249	I	0	“ How . . . ? ”
148252	148264	148249	148249	I	0	“ I do n’t know how to do both , Mom . ”

148348	148369	148345	148345	she	2593	“ Tell me something . If you were on a deserted island , who would you want by your side ? ”
148370	148373	148374	148374	I	0	“ Emily , ”
148379	148411	148374	148374	I	0	“ Being in love is like being on a deserted island , Jameson . You focus on them and them only , and you make everything else fit around that person . ”

148457	148500	148501	148501	She	2594	“ How one man can be so ruthless in business and so giving to those he loves , I will never understand . . . but , the fact that your father is your carbon copy , I know it ’s possible . ”
148509	148551	148501	148501	She	2594	“ The man I love and the man that the world knows are two very different men . . . and that ’s just how I like it . I like that I ’m the only one who gets his softness . ”
148556	148591	148552	148552	I	0	“ I am your father ’s world , Jameson ; he made it work around the company . Never once have I felt neglected or unloved . I have always come first to him . ”
148605	148686	148597	148597	her	2595	“ The man that Emily loves and the one that you think you are are two very different men . You need to allow yourself to be who you are with Emily and be the Jameson Miles that the world knows . It ’s not one or the other like you think it is . The fact that you have put Emily ’s happiness ahead of your own cements that she is the one who has been chosen for you . ”
148687	148695	148696	148696	I	0	“ She wo n’t speak to me , ”
148702	148708	148709	148709	She	2596	“ Then make her listen . ”
