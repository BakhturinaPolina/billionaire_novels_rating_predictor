1870	2300	1864	1864	I	0	"As I looked into Dane 's concerned face , the calmness of him , the sanity of him , was like being wrapped in a soft blanket . He was casually handsome , blond , and lean , with the perpetual toasted - and - salted scruffiness of someone who had just come in from the beach . Most of the time Dane dressed in denim and hemp and enviro - sandals , as if he were perpetually ready for a spontaneous trip to some equatorial region . If you 'd asked Dane to describe his perfect vacation , it would have been some survivalist trek through an exotic jungle , equipped with only a nylon water bag and a pocket knife . Although Dane had never met my mother or sister , I had told him a lot about them , furtively unearthing memories like fragile artifacts . It was n't easy to talk about my past , any part of it . I had managed to trust Dane with the basics : my parents had divorced and my father had left us when I was five . All I heard of my dad after that was that he had gotten a new wife , new children , and there was no place for Tara and me in his second time around . Regardless of his failure as a dad , I could hardly blame him for wanting to escape . It bothered me , however , that my father knew what kind of parent he had left us alone with . Maybe he reasoned that daughters were better off with their mothers . Maybe he had hoped my mother would get better over time . Or maybe he feared one or both of his daughters would turn out exactly like her , and that was not something he could handle . There had been no significant man in my life until I had met Dane at the University of Texas . He was always gentle , reading my signals , never demanding too much . He made me feel safe for the first time ever . And yet for all that , there was something missing between us , something that nagged at me like a pebble that had worked its way into my shoe . Whatever that missing thing was , it kept Dane and me from reaching absolute closeness . As we stood in the apartment kitchen , Dane put a warm hand on my shoulder . The shaky - cold feeling began to subside . "

7024	7029	7020	7020	children	508	" I asked softly . "It
7081	7180	7183	7183	Mom	105	"I could n't begin to reply I had no way to describe how I had struggled to collect every good memory possible . How every moment of my mother 's affection — a hug , a bedtime story — had been a gift from heaven . But mostly how my childhood , and Tara 's , had seemed like a rug pulled out from under us . And how her complete lack of motherly instinct — even the basic urge to protect her offspring — had made it difficult for Tara and me to have relationships with people . "I'm
7185	7232	7183	7183	Mom	105	" I managed to say , my voice thick with regret . But I was fairly certain my mother did n't understand what I was sorry for . A high , mewling cry came from the bedroom . The sound chilled me . He needed something . "Time

7260	7543	7258	7258	Ella	104	"Another cry , this one sharper . It made my back teeth hurt like I 'd just bitten into tin foil . I sped to the bedroom and saw a small form on the bed , wriggling like a baby seal . My heart went so fast that I could n't feel any spaces between the beats . I leaned over , reaching tentatively , uncertain how to pick him up . I was n't good with children . I had never wanted to hold my friends ' babies — they had never appealed to me . I slid my hands beneath the small flopping body . And the head . I knew you were supposed to support the head and neck . Somehow I gathered him up against me , his weight somehow fragile and solid at the same time , and the crying paused , and the infant looked up at me in a squinty Clint - Eastwood sort of way , and the crying started again . He was so unprotected . Helpless . I had only one coherent thought as I went to the kitchen , and it was that no one in my family , including me , should be trusted with one of these . I sat and clumsily readjusted Luke in my arms , and Mom brought a bottle to me . Cautiously I put the silicone nipple — which was n't shaped anything like a normal human one — against the tiny mouth . He latched on and went quiet , intent on feeding . I had n't realized I was holding my breath until I let it out with a sigh of relief . "You

7578	7883	7885	7885	he	517	"I clenched my teeth to hold back a burst of protests — this was n't fair . . . none of it was my fault . . . I was busy , too . . . I had my own life to get back to . But what kept me silent , aside from the knowledge that my mother did n't care , was the fact that the person who was really getting the raw deal was the one who could n't speak up for himself . Luke was a hot potato , doomed to be tossed back and forth until someone was forced to keep him . And then it occurred to me : what if the father was a cokehead or a criminal ? How many guys had Tara slept with , and was I going to have to track them all down and have them tested ? What if some of them refused ? Was I going to have to hire a lawyer?Oh , this was going to be fun . MOM SHOWED ME HOW TO BURP HIM AND TO CHANGE the diaper . Her competence surprised me , especially since she had never been a baby person , and it had undoubtedly been a long time since she had last done such a thing . I tried to picture her as a young mother , patiently attending to the never - ending tasks of caring for a baby . I could n't imagine she had enjoyed any of it . My mother , with only a baby for company , a needy , noisy , inarticulate creature . . . no , it was impossible to envision . I brought in my bags from the car , changed into my pajamas , and took the baby into the guest bedroom . "Where

Only keen familiarity and vast experience would allow you to maneuver through them . Naturally , Luke and I got caught in stop - and - start traffic that turned a fifteen - minute drive into a forty - five - minute one . By the time we reached the artful , glittering structure of 1800 Main , Luke was howling and a foul smell had filled the car , demonstrating that a baby will inevitably have a dirty diaper at the worst possible time in the worst possible place . I drove to the underground parking garage , the commercial half of which was completely full , and I had to drive out again . As I drove farther down the street , I found a public paying lot . After parking in one of the street - level spaces , I managed to change Luke 's diaper in the back seat of the Prius . The baby carrier seemed to weigh about a thousand pounds as I lugged it along the street to the building . Icy air hit me in a controlled blast as I entered the luxurious lobby , all marble and brushed steel and gleaming wood . After glancing at a glass - shielded directory of the office floors , I walked briskly by the reception desk . I knew there was no way they were going to let an unidentified woman with no appointment and no connections simply breeze through to the elevators . "Miss
11480	11495	11648	11649	the mother	609	" One of the men behind the desk gestured for me to approach him . "Someone
11503	11528	11648	11649	the mother	609	" I said brightly . Reaching into the bag hanging from my shoulder , I pulled out the Ziploc bag containing the dirty diaper . "
11539	11599	11602	11602	she	607	nearby?"Blanching at the sight of the bulging baggie , the man hastily directed me toward a restroom on the other side of the elevator bank . Passing the reception desk , I lugged Luke to the center of the double row of elevators . As soon as a door opened , we stepped inside along with four other people . "How
11604	11618	11620	11621	a he	608	" a woman in a smart black skirt suit asked with a smile . "It

I had no way to warm it , so I pushed the nipple into his mouth . But my nephew did n't like his formula cold . Pulling his mouth from the plastic nipple , he began to wail . "Miss

14336	14425	14325	14325	you	122	you?"He stared at me with eyes the color of burnt coffee . A hot , unfamiliar riff of sensation chased down my spine . Jack Travis was a big , sexy tomcat , and there was no doubt in my mind that my sister would have given him anything and everything he wanted . And I did n't care if Travis had holstered his gun , doublebagged it , or tied it in a knot . He could probably get a woman pregnant just by winking at her . "Ella
14435	14473	14325	14325	you	122	" He stunned me by reaching out and gently pulling the glasses from my face . I looked at him through the bewildered blur , and perceived that he was cleaning the smudged lenses with a tissue . "

I was surprised by the ease with which Travis handled the baby , and also by my own intense awareness of him . The scent of him , fresh like cedar and clean earth , sent pleasure signals to my brain . I saw the shadow of whisker - grain that even the closest shave would never completely remove , and the way the thick locks of black hair had been cut in short , no - nonsense layers . "You've

16824	16911	16800	16800	I	0	" I told Dane . Padding barefoot through the suite , I unlatched the door and opened it . Jack Travis stood there , his tie knot loosened and his hair rumpled in waves that fell partially over his forehead . He glanced over me , cataloguing my clean - scrubbed face , my bare legs and feet . Slowly his gaze traveled back up to mine . I felt a dart of heat low in my stomach . My fingers clenched on the cell phone . "

17769	17904	17927	17927	He	744	"The mention of dinner must have revved up my appetite , because my stomach chose that moment to emit a loud , embarrassing growl . Mortified , I clutched a hand over my midriff . At the same time , an impatient mewl came from the bed , and I looked toward the sound . Luke was awake , his tiny arms waving . I hurried to the fridge , got a bottle , and put it into a sink of hot water . While the formula was warming , Jack went to the bed and picked up Luke . Holding him in a secure and competent grip , Jack murmured softly to the baby . It made no difference . Luke started squalling , his mouth wide open and his eyes screwed shut . "There

I was holding a baby , I was tired and cranky , and I could n't remember the last time I had brushed my hair . God knew I was not going to inspire any sexual interest from Jack Travis . He 'd had a long day , and he was hungry . He was probably the kind of person who did n't like to eat by himself . "Okay

I could insist that he cancel my half of the order and replace it with a green salad , a plain potato , and steamed vegetables . But I had gone weak - kneed at the thought of a rib eye . "How

As I wrote down the first address and telephone number , my phone rang . Travis , the display read . I felt a little tumble of nerves and curiosity as I picked it up . "

32497	32587	32602	32602	He	122	" There 're two kinds of environ - mentalists , Ella . The kind who hugs trees and thinks a single - cell amoeba is as important as a Nova Scotian elk . . . and then there 's my kind , which thinks of regulated hunting as part of responsible wildlife management . And since I like to be out in nature as much as possible , I 'm against pollution , overfishing , global warming , deforestation , or anything else that messes with my stomping grounds . "Jack
32782	32787	32788	32788	Jack	122	"What happened with Dane ? "

33332	33387	33279	33279	I	0	right?""No , I strongly condemn cheating when the rules are n't understood by both parties .

33529	33672	33526	33526	your	0	Ella?""It 's about why you have n't committed to anyone yet . It 's really a matter of efficient market dynamics . Most of the women you date are basically the same . You show them a good time , and then it 's on to the next , leaving them to wonder why it did n't last . They do n't realize that no one ever outperforms the market by offering the same thing everyone else is offering , no matter how well packaged . So the only thing that 's going to change your situation is when something random and unexpected occurs . Something you have n't seen on the market before . Which is why you 're going to end up with a woman who 's completely different from what you and everyone else expects you to go for . "
33678	33682	33684	33684	you	0	" What do you think?""I
33693	33840	33684	33684	you	0	" he said . The restaurant Jack drove us to may have been casual by his standards , but it had valet parking , luxury cars in the front , and a crisp white canopy leading up to the door . We were shown to an excellent table by a window . Judging from the pristine and tasteful decor and the trickle of elegant piano music in the background , I expected Luke and me to be thrown out about halfway through the meal . But Luke surprised me by behaving well . And the food was delicious , and I had a glass of chardonnay that struck a chord of pleasure on my tongue , and Jack was possibly the most charming man I had ever met . After lunch , we drove to downtown Houston and into the underground parking garage of 1800 Main . "We're
33847	33851	33990	33991	Miss Travis	182	" I asked . "To

33908	33989	33906	33906	her	2306	"We took an elevator up to a small , gleaming marble - lined lobby featuring a contemporary bronze sculpture and a stately concierge desk . The concierge , a young man in a meticulously tailored suit , smiled at Jack and looked subtly askance at the sleeping baby . Jack had insisted on carrying him , for which I was grateful . My arms had not yet accustomed themselves to the new responsibility of hauling Luke and his paraphernalia everywhere . "Tell
33997	34002	34004	34005	Mr. Travis	131	" Jack told him . "Yes
34007	34034	34004	34005	Mr. Travis	131	"I followed Jack through a set of etched glass doors that slid apart with a soft whoosh , and we went to a pair of elevators . "

34191	34193	34194	34194	We	1038	""Why ? "
34216	34223	34198	34198	Jack	122	" I ca n't afford it . ""We'll

34625	34633	34634	34634	She	104	" Oh , what a cute baby . "

34675	34695	34650	34650	she	104	" Jack returned calmly , ignoring her efforts to take Luke . He bent his head for a kiss . "

34742	34821	34706	34706	Haven	199	"Haven welcomed us into her apartment , a small one - bedroom unit decorated in shades of white and cream and distressed dark woods . The disciplined color scheme was enlivened by a few jolts of fresh botanical green . A Swedish wooden floor clock occupied the corner . The main living space was filled with a few simple pieces of furniture — antique French chairs , an overstuffed sofa covered in black - and - cream toile . "My
34828	34837	34824	34824	Todd	185	" Haven told me , noticing my interest . "It
34850	34887	34824	34824	Todd	185	""Todd says the mistake some people make with decorating small spaces is that they choose too many delicate pieces . You need something substantial like that sofa , or there 's nothing to anchor the room . ""It

34975	34984	34985	34985	Haven	199	"Jack told me a little about your situation , "

35105	35259	35099	35099	you	1056	" I began , but my voice trailed away as he paged through the periodical . I could tell the moment he found my page , with its cartoon portrait of me wearing cartoon high heels and a fashionable swing coat . And I knew exactly what he was reading even before his brows began to inch toward his hairline . Dear Miss Independent , I'm dating a fantastic guy — handsome , successful , caring , and good in bed . But there 's a problem . He 's built on the petite side , sexually speaking . I 've always heard that size does n't matter , but I ca n't help wishing he had more to offer in that department . I want to stay with him in spite of the fact that he 's hung like a cocktail weenie , but how can I stop wishing for a kielbasa ? "

It had taken four years of hard - won confidences and emotional risk for Dane and me to reach the intimacy we now shared . I could n't imagine having that with any other man . Before I could move , Jack came to stand beside the bed , looking down at me with soft dark eyes . I fell back a little , my stomach clenching with pleasure as I imagined for a split - second that he was about to lower over me , and his weight would be so hard and satisfying—"Your

40687	41297	40672	40672	you	199	" * * * JACK FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN MANY OF HAVEN 'S childhood stories . In the manner of older brothers , he had alternately been the hero and the villain . Most often the villain . But now in adulthood , in a family with complex dynamics , a close bond had formed between them . According to Haven , their older brother Gage had always been the focus of their father 's greatest demands , highest praise , and deepest ambitions . The only child of Churchill Travis 's first marriage , Gage had worked hard to please his father , to become the perfect son . He had been serious , driven , hyper - responsible , distinguishing himself at an elite boarding school , later graduating from UT and Harvard Business School . But Gage was not nearly the hard - ass their father had been . He had an innate kindness , an allowance for human frailty , that Churchill Travis found difficult to summon . Churchill 's second marriage had lasted until the death of his wife , Ava , and had produced three children : Jack , Joe , and Haven . Since Gage already shouldered the main burden of expectation and responsibility , Jack had the opportunity to play , experiment , run wild , make friends . He had always been the first to jump into a fight and the first to shake hands afterward . He 'd played every sport , charmed his teachers into giving him better grades than he deserved , and dated the prettiest girls in school . He was a loyal friend who paid his debts and never broke his word . Nothing made Jack madder than when someone made a deal with him and would n't keep their side of it . When Churchill had decided his young sons needed to be reminded what hard labor was , he set them to laying sod in the blistering south Texas sun , or building a hand - cut stone fence along the edge of their property , until their muscles were on fire and a dark tan had saturated their skin several layers down . Of the three boys , only Jack had truly enjoyed the outside labor . Sweat , dirt , physical exertion — had all felt purifying to him . His basic need to test himself against the land , and nature , manifested in a lifelong love of outdoor pursuits : hunting , fishing , anything that took him away from the air - conditioned opulence of River Oaks . Haven had been spared these particular life lessons from her father . Instead , she had been subjected to her mother 's notions of how to bring up a girl to be ladylike . Naturally Haven had been a tomboy , forever trailing after her three brothers . Because of the significant age difference between Gage and Haven , he had assumed a vaguely paternal role , intervening on her behalf when he deemed it necessary . But Jack had warred with Haven on many occasions , such as when she had gone uninvited into his room or played with his train set without asking . For revenge , he had given her Indian burns , and when she had tattled on him , their daddy had beaten him with his belt until Haven had cried . Schooled in the Texan art of manliness , Jack had prided himself on not shedding one tear . Afterward , Churchill had told his wife Ava that Jack was the most stubborn boy alive . "
41304	41437	40672	40672	you	199	" the father had said , frustrated that he could not motivate the rebellious Jack the way he had with Gage . Haven told me she had been miserable when Gage , her champion , had been sent away to school . But contrary to all expectations , Jack had not persecuted her in their brother 's absence . When she came home crying one day because a boy at school was bullying her , Jack had listened to the whole story , and rode off on his bike to take care of the problem . The bully never bothered Haven again . Never came near her , as a matter of fact . They had lost touch for a while after Haven married a man her father had n't approved of . "

41601	41644	41582	41582	you	1177	down?""Absolutely . Jack likes women — I mean truly likes them , not in some misogynistic notch - on - the - bedpost way . But he 's not going to commit until he finds someone he 's sure he can trust . ""Because

41771	41855	41856	41856	you	1184	"I changed the subject at the first opportunity . Talking about Jack made me restless and vaguely irritable , the way I felt when I wanted something I knew was bad for me . I TALKED WITH DANE ON THE PHONE EVERY NIGHT telling him about my new surroundings and about Luke . Although Dane did n't want to have anything to do with a baby personally , he certainly did n't mind hearing about Luke and the experience of caring for him . "Do
41864	41880	41856	41856	you	1184	" I asked Dane , relaxing on the sofa with Luke draped on my chest . "I
41931	41960	41963	41963	Ella	104	""Yes , but what about raising a child who will care about those things , too ? That 's a way to make the world a better place . ""Come

And just once , I 'd like to go out without all this paraphernalia . It 's insane . The stroller , the diapers , wipes , burp cloths , binkies , bottles . . . I 've forgotten what it 's like to just pick up the keys and walk out the door . And there are all these pediatric visits I 've had to schedule — developmental assessments and screenings and shots — so it 's a good thing I 'm not sleeping , because I 'll need the extra time to work . ""Maybe

42242	42370	42422	42422	God	148	" Dane said . BY THE END OF MY FIRST FULL WEEK AT 1800 MAIN , I was still mastering the trick of carrying a bag of groceries and pushing a stroller while getting through doorways . It was early Friday evening . The traffic was so bad that instead of driving anywhere , I had decided to walk a quarter of a mile to an Express grocery and deli , and back . After the short walk in the heat , Luke and I were parboiled . The plastic handles of the grocery bags were slipping in my wet palm and the diaper bag threatened to slide off my shoulder as I maneuvered the stroller into the lobby . And the baby was making fretful noises . "You
42375	42380	42422	42422	God	148	" I said breathlessly , "
42432	42446	42424	42424	Luke	117	" Swearing and sweating , I pushed the stroller past the concierge desk . "Miss
42454	42463	42447	42447	Varner	117	" the concierge asked , beginning to rise . "No
42474	42568	42470	42470	We	1188	" I lurched past the etched glass doors and reached an elevator just as it opened . Two people stepped out , a gorgeous redhead wearing a skimpy white dress and strappy gold sandals . . . and Jack Travis in a lean black suit , a crisp white shirt open at the throat , and sleek black oxfords . In one glance he took in my dilemma . Simultaneously , he reached for the grocery bags and used his foot to keep open the elevator door . His dark brown eyes sparkled . "
42574	42589	42572	42572	Ella	104	"My breath stuck in my throat . I found myself smiling at him idiotically . "
42594	42606	42592	42592	Jack	122	""You heading up ? Looks like you could use a hand . ""No
42615	42624	42613	42613	you	122	" I pushed the stroller onto the elevator . "We'll

42665	42743	42746	42746	he	1191	" The woman seemed friendly , and nice , giving me a wide - open smile as she stepped back into the elevator . I could n't fault Jack 's taste . Sonya was a stunner , with gleaming perfect skin , vivid red hair , and a magnificent figure . As she bent over to coo at the fussy baby , the combination of her abundant cleavage and beautiful face was enough to make Luke quiet . "
42753	42757	42746	42746	he	1191	" she exclaimed . "He

43104	43128	43037	43040	a boyfriend in Austin	1197	" I said , watching Jack set the grocery bags on the coffee table . Sonya cast an admiring glance around the apartment . "

43197	43317	43194	43194	Jack	122	"A crib with a changing table attachment . I bought it at Rice Village the other day when I was out with Haven . Unfortunately , they charge a hundred bucks extra if you want it assembled , so I said I 'd rather do it myself . The delivery guys brought this box of parts with some instructions , and so far I 'm still trying to figure it out . I think it would be easier if I could read the manual . So far I 've found the Japanese , French , and German pages , but nothing in English . Now I sort of wish I 'd gone ahead and paid the extra hundred bucks . "

43347	43410	43339	43339	Jack	122	" But he did n't move , just looked from me and Luke to the pile of crib parts . The odd moment of expectant silence caused my heart to lurch with an extra thud . His gaze returned to mine , and he gave me a brief nod that held an implicit promise : Later . I did n't want that . "

THREE HOURS LATER LUKE WATCHED FROM AN INFANT bouncy seat while I sat on the floor surrounded by crib parts . I was finished with dinner , which had consisted of spaghetti with tomato sauce , ground beef , and fresh basil . When the leftovers were cool , I was going to freeze them in individual - size portions . Having grown tired of Mozart and the sock puppets , I had hooked up my iPod to the speakers . The air was filled with the raw , sexy purr of Etta James . "

43756	43768	43608	43608	you	1203	" I tried to ignore the heavy pounding of my heart . "

I had to admit , I enjoyed watching as he rolled up his sleeves over hair - dusted forearms and knelt in front of the wooden frame , his body athletic and superbly conditioned . I sat nearby with a glass of wine and handed screws to him . Every now and then he got close enough that I caught the scent of him , a sexual incense of male sweat and clean skin . He swore a couple of times as a couple of screws were stripped , the fluent profanity immediately followed by a beg - pardon . Jack Travis was a novelty in my experience , an old - fashioned man 's man . None of the boys I had gone to college with had been anything more than that , just boys trying to figure out who they were and what their place in the world was . Dane and his friends were sensitive , environmentally aware guys who rode bikes and had Facebook accounts . I could n't imagine Jack Travis ever blogging or worrying about finding himself , and it was pretty certain that he did n't give a damn about whether or not his clothes were sustainably produced .

45543	45567	45528	45528	I	0	"The bedroom 's so small , I 'd rather keep it in here . Is that weird , having a crib in the main room?""Not
45579	45635	45573	45573	Luke	117	"With Jack 's help , I moved the crib beside the sofa and put a sheet over the mattress . Gently , I lowered the drowsy baby into the crib and covered him with a blanket , and started a mobile playing overhead . Bears and honeypots circled slowly , accompanied by a gentle lullaby . "

The dark city was seething outside , scored with traffic , people swarming , drinking , dancing , while the ground slowly released the heat of the day . But we were tucked away in this cool , protected place , everything as it should be . I needed to fill Luke 's bottles , and get ready for the night . We had a routine . I found something deeply comforting in the rituals of bath and bedtime . "It

Methodically , he dumped all the scraps of cardboard and plastic into the flat rectangular box the crib had come in . Lifting the box with one hand , he carried it to the door . "

I wondered what my responsibility was . It was clear to me that Tara was not at the point at which she could make decisions about the future . She was vulnerable , and she was probably being deceived by Mark Gottler into thinking that he would take care of her , that he would provide for her and the baby indefinitely . Maybe he had preyed upon her and taken advantage , thinking there would be no repercussions because she had virtually no family to speak of . But she had me .

51600	51637	51587	51587	Jack	122	" God knows our dad was hardly ever around . And when he was , we could hardly wait to get rid of him . We grew up without a father , most of the time . ""And
51644	52042	51587	51587	Jack	122	" Haven said . They glanced at each other , she and Jack , and burst out laughing as if at some absurdity . We had a casual dinner , and everyone took turns holding Luke . Haven continued to pour the sangria , and I drank until I was pleasantly giddy . I laughed more than I had in weeks . Months . I wondered what it meant , however , that I could enjoy the company of people who were so different from Dane and my friends in Austin . I was certain that Dane would find much to criticize about Hardy and Jack , both of them well versed in backroom deals and bending the rules . They were older than the men I was accustomed to , and far more cynical , and probably ruthless when it came to getting what they wanted . And yet so damnably charming . That was the danger , I thought . The affable manners and the charm , blinding you to what they really were . The kind of man who could control you , steer you into compromise after compromise , and make you think you were happy doing it . And only after you had walked into the trap would you realize the mistake you had made . The revelation was that even knowing this , I could be so attracted to a man like Jack Travis . I sat next to him on one of the deep velvet sofas , trying to identify the feeling that was stealing over me . I finally realized it was relaxation . I had never been an especially relaxed person , always wound tight and waiting for an emergency to strike . But tonight I was strangely at ease . Maybe it was because I was in a situation in which I had no need to protect myself or prove anything . Maybe it was the sleeping baby , warm and safe in my arms . As I settled back with Luke , I found myself tucked against Jack 's warm side , one of his arms extended along the sofa back . Closing my eyes , I let my cheek rest on his shoulder . Just for a moment . One of his hands came up to the side of my face , stroking my hair . "What
52053	52060	52044	52044	you	1315	" I heard him ask mildly . "Nothing
52062	52070	52044	52044	you	1315	" she said in a defensive tone . "
52090	52095	52096	52096	I	0	""I'm fine , too , "

52142	52193	52122	52122	My	0	" There was a tremor of laughter in Jack 's voice , and his hand moved over my hair . His fingers delved through the light , loose strands to my scalp and stroked tenderly . I closed my eyes again and held still , hoping he would n't stop . "What
52198	52204	52122	52122	My	0	" I mumbled , yawning . "Eight

52531	52583	52501	52501	Haven	199	" Jack replied in a tone of unqualified disdain . And although I wanted to say something in Dane 's defense , I was too exhausted to make a sound . Either I dozed more heavily or a long silence passed , because I did n't hear anything for a while . "Ella
52585	52612	52613	52613	Ella	104	" I eventually heard , and I shook my head in annoyance . I was so comfortable , and I wanted the voice to go away . "

54599	54940	54597	54597	Ella	104	" Jack 's lips found mine , following insistently as I tried to evade him . His hand curled around the back of my neck , his fingers strong . A shock went through me , spurring my heart into a fast , frantic beat . He kissed me repeatedly , long indecent kisses , all slippery friction and hot silk . I gasped at the abrasion of his shaven jaw and cheeks , the insistent exploration of his tongue . Blindly I reached for his wrists , one behind my neck , one at my side , and I gripped hard , the tips of my nails digging into dense muscle . I did n't know if I was trying to pull his hands away or push them closer . He kept kissing me , exploring roughly , expertly . I let go of his wrists and molded against the arousing terrain of his body . I had never existed in such a purely physical compass , thinking nothing , aware of nothing . Only needing . Craving . He slid one hand to my bottom , urging me against the stiff , enticing pressure of his erection , and I was panting , arching in a desperate effort to keep him right there . His kisses gentled , his mouth absorbing the sounds that rose in my throat . I strained against him , sensation collecting , muscles tightening as his hand pressed me in a subtle rhythm . Nothing had ever been so delicious as his mouth , his body , the hands that urged me forward until our hips were rubbing in a lazy exact pulse . The tension gathered in a surge that promised release . . . wrenching , out - of - control , in - heat spasms that would cause me to die of humiliation . All that from a kiss and a fully clothed embrace . Not going to happen , I thought in panic , tearing my mouth from his . "Wait
54942	54968	54597	54597	Ella	104	" I said with difficulty , my fingers tangling helplessly in his shirt . My body throbbed in every extremity . My mouth felt swollen . "
54974	54999	54597	54597	Ella	104	"Jack looked down at me , his eyes heavy - lidded , his cheekbones and the bridge of his nose burnished with high color . "
55003	55008	55009	55009	We	1339	" he said thickly . "
55018	55162	55009	55009	We	1339	" Before I could make another sound , he bent to take my mouth again . This time there was intent in the rhythm , a shameless grinding deliberateness . He was pushing me , teasing , letting my squirming body carry the momentum . Taste , movement , hot rhythmic stroking , all pulled the ecstatic sensations into one forward direction . I jerked against him , giving a low cry . The rush was so powerful that I could n't keep up with my own heartbeat . I shivered and hunched and clenched my hands in his shirt . And Jack prolonged the pleasure , maintaining the unhurried sliding rhythm , knowing exactly what he was doing . As the last few twitches left my body , dissolving in a white - hot glow , I whimpered and sagged against him . "
55176	55193	55169	55169	You	1340	"Jack nipped at my chin , my scarlet cheek , the tender skin of my throat . "

58247	58335	58243	58243	Gottler	160	" * * * THE FELLOWSHIP OF ETERNAL TRUTH HAD ITS OWN Web site and Wikipedia page . The main pastor , Noah Cardiff , was a handsome man in his forties , married with five children . His wife , Angelica , was a slender , attractive woman who wore enough eyeshadow to recoat an RV roof . It quickly became apparent that Eternal Truth was more of an empire than a church . In fact , it was referred to in the Houston Chronicle as a "
58339	58656	58243	58243	Gottler	160	" owning a small fleet of private jets , an airstrip , and real estate that included mansions , sports facilities , and its own publishing company . I was astonished to learn that Eternal Truth also had its own oil and gas field , run by a subsidiary company called Eternity Petrol Incorporated . The church employed over five hundred people and had a twelve - member board of directors , five of whom were Cardiff 's relatives . I could n't find any clips of Mark Gottler on YouTube , but I did find some of Noah Cardiff . He was charismatic and charming , making the occasional self - deprecating joke , assuring his worldwide congregation of all the good things their Creator had in store for them . He looked angelic , with his black hair and fair skin and blue eyes . In fact , watching the YouTube clip made me feel so good that if a collection plate had been passing by at that moment , I would have dropped twenty bucks in it . And if Cardiff had that effect on a feminist agnostic , there was no telling what a true believer might have been moved to donate . On Friday , the babysitter arrived at nine . Her name was Teena , and she seemed friendly and competent . I had gotten her name from Haven , who said Teena had done a great job with her nephew . I was worried about leaving Luke in anyone else 's care — it was the first time we had ever been separated — but it was also something of a relief to have a break . As we had agreed , I met Jack downstairs in the lobby . I was a few minutes late , having lingered to give a few last - minute instructions to Teena . "
58659	58678	58679	58679	I	0	" I quickened my stride as I walked toward Jack , who was standing by the concierge desk . "
58687	58691	58692	58692	Jack	122	""It 's fine , "
58695	58702	58692	58692	Jack	122	" We still have plenty of — "

58843	58859	58863	58863	Jack	122	" I thought this was more appropriate for church than jeans and Birken - stocks . "I

58906	58945	58884	58884	he	122	"That appeared to set off another round of thoughts . I thought Jack 's color seemed a little high , although it was difficult to tell with that rosewood tan . His voice sounded strained as he asked , "

59107	59528	59072	59072	I	0	" I muttered , preparing to dislike everything about Eternal Truth . When we went in , I was stunned by the grandeur of the place . The lobby was dominated by a gigantic LED screen showing film clips of happy families having picnics , walking through sunny neighborhoods , parents pushing children on swings , washing the dog , going to church together . Towering fifteen - foot - high statues of Jesus and the disciples stood near entrances to a food court and an atrium space lined with emerald glass . Panels of green malachite and warm cherry wood lined the walls , and acres of immaculate patterned carpeting covered the floor . The bookstore on the other side of the lobby was filled with people . Everyone seemed upbeat , people pausing to talk and laugh , while feel - good music wafted through the air . I had read that Eternal Truth was both admired and criticized for its health - and - wealth gospel . Pastor Cardiff emphasized often that God wanted his congregation to enjoy material prosperity as well as spiritual advancement . In fact , he insisted that the two went hand - in - hand . If one of the church members was having financial difficulty , he needed to pray harder for success . Money , it seemed , was a reward for faith . I did n't know nearly enough about theology to engage in a competent discussion . But I instinctively distrusted anything that was this slickly packaged and marketed . On the other hand . . . the people here seemed happy . If the doctrine worked for them , if it satisfied their needs , did I have any right to object ? Perplexed , I stopped with Jack as a smiling greeter came to us . After a brief murmured consultation , the greeter serenely directed us beyond a set of massive marble columns to an escalator , and we went upward into an airy space of sunlight and emerald glass , and a limestone cornice engraved with scripture : I CAME THAT THEY MAY HAVE LIFE AND HAVE IT ABUNDANTLY , JOHN 10:10A secretary was already waiting for us at the top of the escalator . She led us to an executive suite with a spacious conference room . There was a twenty - foot - long keystone table made of exotic woods , with a strip of colored printed glass running along the center . "Wow

59609	59626	59600	59600	You	239	" I asked as soon as the secretary left . He gave me a warning glance . "
59631	59673	59674	59674	you	239	""According to what I 've read , Eternal Truth 's message is that God wants all of us to be rich and successful . So I guess you 're a little closer to heaven than the rest of us , Jack . ""If

He was stocky and full - cheeked , well fed , well groomed . Gottler had an air of being above the flock , calmly accepting their reverence . You could n't imagine him being at the mercy of normal bodily functions . This was the man my sister had slept with?Gottler 's eyes were the color of melted Kraft caramels . He looked at Jack and went straight for him with an outstretched hand . "
59850	59895	59681	59681	I	0	" With his free hand , he briefly covered their clasped ones , making it a two - handed shake . One could take that either as a controlling gesture , or one of exceptional warmth . Jack 's pleasant expression did n't change . "I
59903	59934	59900	59901	a friend	2812	" Gottler continued with a smile , reaching for me next . I shook his hand and was accorded the same two - handed grip . I pulled back irritably . "

60132	60218	60220	60220	Ella	104	here?"I shook my head , wondering how often he talked with her . Why would a married man in his profession take the risks that he had , having an affair with an unstable young woman and getting her pregnant ? It frightened me to comprehend that tens of millions of dollars — more — were at risk because of this situation . A sex scandal would be a huge blow to the church , not to mention the ruin of Mark Gottler 's career . "I
60222	60226	60220	60220	Ella	104	" Jack said , "

Either way , I was impatient . I wanted to talk about Tara . I wanted decisions to be made . As I lifted my head to steal a glance at Gottler , I found that he was doing the same with me , sizing up the situation , assessing me as an adversary . And still he kept talking . "

Clearly there were limits to what Eternal Truth was willing to do for Tara Varner , no matter that one of its chief clergy had knocked her up . Why did I have to be here prying something out of Mark Gottler that he should have already offered?My thoughts must have shown on my face , because Jack interceded quickly . "We're

Gottler made a comment about having to get clearance from his board of directors , and then Jack smiled and said he could n't picture Gottler having a problem there , and for the next few minutes I listened , half - impressed and half - disgusted . They finished with the acknowledgment that both sides were going to let their lawyers hash out the details . "

62047	62214	62038	62038	he	122	" Laughing quietly , Cardiff turned to me . He was dazzling . A big man , though not quite so tall as Jack , and built on a more slender scale . Whereas Jack looked and moved like an athlete , Noah Cardiff had the grace of a dancer . It was striking to see the two side by side , Jack with his sexy , earthy appeal , and Cardiff , refined and austerely beautiful . The pastor 's complexion was fair , the kind that blushed easily , and his nose was narrow and high - bridged . The smile was angelic and slightly rueful , the smile of a mortal man who was all too aware of human frailty . And the eyes were those of a saint , benevolent light blue , his gaze making you feel annointed in some way . As he stepped close enough to shake my hand , I caught the scents of lavender and amber spice . "
62234	62245	62246	62246	Varner	104	" Pausing , he sent a quizzical smile to Gottler . "

Jack grabbed me and kept kissing me , opening my mouth with his . I tasted warmth , the sweet permeation of a breath mint . . . I tasted Jack himself . Despairing , I wondered why it was n't like this with Dane . But the way Jack 's mouth caught at mine , the firm damp articulation of each kiss , each succulent impact , was too insanely good to resist . He pulled me close and searched slowly with his tongue . The deeper he went , the more heavily I sagged against him , my entire body saturated with lust . His hands went over my black suit , fondling and gripping lightly . My skin turned hot beneath the layer of delicate wool . He brought his fingers up to my face , stroking back my hair , and I felt a tremor in his hand , the vibration of intense desire . Reaching behind my head , he tangled his fingers in my hair and kissed me . I shivered as I felt his free hand working at the three fabric - covered snaps that held the front of my jacket together . The garment parted , revealing a stretchy cream - colored camisole , held up by two threadlike straps . Jack muttered something — an imprecation , a prayer — and he reached beneath the camisole to find the soft , fine skin of my waist . We were both shaking now , too absorbed and ravenous to stop . He jerked the fabric upward to reveal private skin that gleamed eggshell - white in the shadows . His head bent to one breast , his mouth hunting for the tip . I drew in a hissing breath as I felt the sinuous glide of his tongue , a firm wet tug . Every pull and stroke sent a shot of pleasure to the pit of my stomach . I leaned my head back against the cold , hard wall , simmering , my hips writhing in a forward tilt . Jack stood and took my mouth aggressively , his hand sliding over my breast . Long , erotic kisses . . . bites and licks of kisses , until I was drunk on sensation . My arms curled around his neck , pulling his head harder over mine , and he took the offering with a low , savage sound . I had never known such desperate excitement , wanting more , wanting to tell him , Do anything , anything , I do n't care , do it now . I groped over the front of his body , the powerful muscles covered in a smooth elegant suit , and that excited me even more , the thought of what was beneath those civilized layers . He gripped my skirt , pulled roughly , and I gasped as I felt the air on my legs , cool against the torturous hot ache of my skin and nerves . He pried beneath the elastic of my panties , searching between my thighs , the humid flesh opening to the invasion of his fingers . I felt him breathing against my neck , the brutal muscles of his upper arm flexing beneath my hand . He slipped a finger inside me , and another . I closed my eyes , going weak as his thumb skated tenderly over my clit , his fingers massaging deep and sure . With each flexing stroke , the knobs of his knuckles gently rubbed a maddening place inside . The pleasure was disorienting . . . disabling . . . crazy . For the first time in my life , I wanted something more than safety . I wanted Jack with an intensity that went beyond choice or thought . I fumbled with his belt , zipper , button , opening his pants . I gripped him , the shape of him huge and rearing . Withdrawing his fingers , Jack tugged my underwear and skirt out of the way . He lifted me with shocking ease . The realization of how strong he was sent a flood of anxious excitement through me . Helplessly I wrapped my arms around his neck and dropped my head on his shoulder . Yes . Yes . He entered me , and I squirmed at the impossible thickness of him . Kissing my neck , he murmured for me to relax , he would take care of me , just let him do it , let him in . . . . He brought my full weight down until my toes grazed the floor , and the luscious force opened me inexorably . It was stunningly erotic , having sex while fully clothed , tightly impaled , whimpering against his greedy kisses . Jack set the steady upward - plunging cadence , and every time he went in , my muscles clenched on the pleasure of it , pulling helplessly , taking more and more of him . I was spasming , riding the heat , my limbs tightening around that big driving body until the sheer plenitude of feeling tipped me over into a rich , nearly unendurable orgasm . Jack took my choked cry into his mouth , muffling the sounds I made . He drove deep and held and shuddered , his breath breaking as he found his own release . A long time passed before either of us moved . I was clasped against him , intimate flesh moistly locked , my head lolling on his shoulder . I felt drugged . I knew that very soon , when my mind started functioning again , I was going to feel some things I badly wanted to avoid . Starting with shame . There were so many inappropriate things about what we 'd done that I was actually awed . And the worst part was how good it had felt , still felt , with his body wedged inside mine , his arms secure around me . One of his hands clasped my head more firmly against his shoulder , as if he were trying to protect me from something . I heard a quiet curse . "We
65613	65618	64515	64515	You	0	" I said weakly . "I
65624	65716	64515	64515	You	0	" he whispered . He began to move , lifting me off himself , and I made a sound of distress . I was wet , and a little sore , and all my muscles were trembling . Leaning against the wall , I let him pull my clothes back into place and snap my jacket back up . After fastening his own clothes , he found my handbag and gave it to me . I could n't look at him , even when he took my head in his hands . "Ella
65718	65755	65756	65756	I	0	" The scent of his breath and the salty essence of sex and hot skin mingled in a sublime erotic perfume . I wanted more of him . The realization brought frustrated tears to my eyes . "

Otherwise I was pretty sure I would be naked in his bed within the next ten or fifteen minutes . Jack caught my wrist , pulling my caressing hand away from his face , and he skewered me with a wrathful stare . "
66213	66228	66126	66126	you	122	" He hauled me into his arms and held me close , breathing hard . "

Jack drew his hands over my shoulders , my waist , my hips , as if he could n't keep from touching me . I wanted to turn against him and let him hold me , and go up to his apartment . Instead I got off the elevator when we reached the sixth floor , and Jack followed me . "You
66400	66463	66306	66307	a psycho	1534	" I said . He scowled and stayed with me until we got to the apartment . I was about to enter the combination on the keypad , when Jack took my shoulders and turned me to face him . The way he stared at me brought a flush to every visible inch of skin . His hand slid behind my neck . "Jack—"He

67469	67612	67465	67465	you	102	" He reached out and pulled me over him until I was half - sprawled , my hair falling into his face . The top two buttons of his hemp shirt were undone , revealing his smooth golden chest . I got a familiar clean , acrid whiff of his salt rock deodorant . Affectionately I bent to kiss him , those lips I had kissed so many thousands of times . But the gentle contact did n't bring the same sweetness and comfort it always had . In fact , it produced a strange ticklish aversion . I lifted my head . Dane pulled me closer , and that sent a thrill of something unfamiliar and not at all pleasant through me . How was that possible?Feeling the way I stiffened , Dane loosened his arms and looked at me quizzically . "

67668	67738	67739	67739	Sweetie	247	" His tone was gently encouraging . Did I have to tell him what I had done with Jack ? How could I explain any of it ? Helplessly I sat there and stared at him . It seemed as if every pore in my body went through a quick - freeze and a rapid thaw , drawing out an uncomfortable film of sweat . Dane 's expression changed . "
67803	67816	67817	67817	I	0	.""Lately I 've been spending a lot of time with Jack Travis , "

67920	67936	67918	67918	Luke	117	" I told the baby , even though he was oblivious to my emotional crisis . "

68225	68265	68222	68222	I	0	" but he can be crude . And he 's macho and traditional . He 's like the football jock in high school that all the girls lined up for , and I always hated that kind of guy . ""Me

68667	68725	68807	68807	Dane	102	like?""I—"My mouth opened and closed . Chagrined , I contemplated various ways to explain that so far we 'd had what could only have been described as one hell of a good - night kiss , and also a parking - garage quickie . And both times had been spectacular . No , there were no words . "Classified
68728	68792	68807	68807	Dane	102	" I said sheepishly . For a moment we sat silently , both of us a little taken aback that I was withholding something , when I had always told Dane everything without reserve . Our relationship had always been completely transparent . This was new , this concept that there was some part of my life Dane could n't casually riffle through . "You're
68796	68800	68807	68807	Dane	102	" I asked . "
68802	68806	68807	68807	Dane	102	jealous?""Jealous , maybe , "
68817	68881	68807	68807	Dane	102	" But not angry . And not possessive . Because it comes down to this : I do n't want a traditional relationship and I never will . But if you want to explore that with Travis , you should . You do n't need permission , and it 's not mine to give . And you 're going to do it anyway . "I

69017	69111	68924	68924	I	0	"I crawled over to him and put my head on his chest . We sat like that for a while , still except for the occasional sigh . Both of us were quiet with the recognition that something was ending , and something was beginning . Dane touched my chin and lifted my face upward , and kissed me gently . Only then did I understand that Dane had always been a friend I had slept with , and how entirely different that was from having a lover who could be a friend . "Hey
69113	69118	68924	68924	I	0	" Dane said softly . "

69249	69302	69239	69239	Haven	199	" Jack 's been in a bitch of a mood . In fact , everyone in the office was relieved when he left to go to a construction site for a project he 's managing . Otherwise I think his secretary Helen was going to knock him unconscious with the laminating machine . ""I

69542	69609	69533	69533	I	0	"I've always seen Jack go out with the career heiress types , or airhead actresses or models , and I think it 's because he wanted to avoid this . . . being completely crazy about someone , and being vulnerable .

70106	70365	70369	70369	Ella	104	" I said dourly , and Haven snickered . THE ONLY CONCEIVABLE ZIP CODE IN HOUSTON FOR Churchill Travis to live in was 77019 , since you could n't move up from River Oaks . Located in the geographical center of Houston , it was one of the wealthiest communities in the nation . According to Haven , FOR SALE signs were never allowed in River Oaks . When a home became available it usually received multiple offers and sold within days . Lawyers , businessmen , hedge - fund operators , surgeons , and sports stars had all elected to live in the pine - and - oak - shaded paradise , which was close to the Galleria and Rice , and the best private schools in Texas . Some of the houses in 77019 were thirty thousand square feet or more , but the Travis mansion was relatively small in its category , at twelve thousand square feet . It was blessed , however , with a remarkably good view of the board - flat city , being located on a bluff by the bayou . As we passed lush gardens and esplanades , all glowing in the light of a wine - colored sunset , my eyes widened at the rows of neo - Georgians , Taras , colonial revivals , Tuscan villas , and French chateaus . There did n't seem to be one indigenous Houston style , but rather a sampling of time periods and places , all built on a grand scale . "You'll
70371	70388	70369	70369	Ella	104	" Haven said reassuringly , twisting around from the front seat of Hardy 's Mercedes sedan . "
70428	70432	70434	70435	Peter Jackson	249	""Why was it a bomb?""Well
70470	70477	70478	70478	I	0	""That does n't sound so bad , "
70481	70525	70478	70478	I	0	"No , the bad part was that Vivian got a local Boy Scout group to dress like Hobbits and wander through the party . They shed all over the house , and Dad was allergic to the fur . He complained for weeks . "
70529	70543	70526	70526	Haven	199	" But I 'm sure she wo n't do anything like that tonight . ""Start
70552	70723	70526	70526	Haven	199	" Hardy advised me . The Travis mansion , a stately European stone structure , occupied a three - acre lot . We passed through a set of open iron gates and approached a parking area filled with pricey vehicles . A massive garage with huge glass remote - control doors that displayed a Bentley , a Mercedes , a Shelby Cobra , and at least seven other cars , looked like some gigantic vending - machine - of - the - gods . White - coated valets steered the shining vehicles into neatly marked places with the tenderness of parents tucking beloved children into bed . I was a little dazed as I accompanied Haven and Hardy along the walkway to the milling , glittering crowd . Live music filled the air , a boisterous horn section backing a well - known big - band singer who had recently won acclaim as a supporting actor in a Spielberg movie . The singer , still in his twenties , was crooning "
70730	70777	70526	70526	Haven	199	" in a silky semiscat patter . I felt like I had stepped into some alternate reality . Maybe a movie set . The scene was gorgeous , but it seemed bizarre that people really lived this way , that such excess was commonplace to them . "I've
70785	70811	70526	70526	Haven	199	" I started , and fell silent , afraid of sounding gauche . Hardy glanced down at me , his blue eyes gleaming with humor . "
70815	70970	70526	70526	Haven	199	" I realized that he really did understand , that while this scene was entirely familiar to Haven , it was a far cry from the east - of - Houston trailer park he had grown up in . They were an interesting couple , Hardy so big and all - American , Haven petite and exquisite . For all their size difference , however , they seemed remarkably well matched . Any outsider could n't help but be aware of the glimmering chemistry between the two , a feisty appreciation of each other 's intelligence , a mutually provocative awareness . But also tenderness . I saw it especially when Hardy stole glances at Haven while her attention was focused elsewhere . He looked like he wanted to carry her away and keep her all to himself . I envied their ability to stay so close and yet not feel trapped or suffocated . "Let
70980	71024	71025	71025	you	1588	" Haven said , leading the way into the house . She looked amazing in a short dress made of crinkled bronze organza , the skirt festively tacked and gathered in a style that could only be worn by an extremely slender woman . "Do

71058	71077	71099	71099	He	122	" I did n't get a chance . He 's been out of reach most of the day . "Jack
71494	71498	71499	71499	Hardy	189	"He 's outside , "
71513	71515	71516	71516	I	0	"Jack ? "
71520	71525	71526	71526	Haven	199	"No , my dad . "

71710	71720	71721	71722	Ella Varner	104	" Turning toward him , I extended my hand . "
71753	71780	71781	71781	They	145	they?"He smiled as he shook my hand . His teeth were a scrupulous shade of white I always found mildly startling in a person his age . "
71790	71872	71781	71781	They	145	" He was a good - looking old guy , not much taller than me , his steel - colored hair cut short , his skin leathery and sun - cured . Charisma clung to him as if it had been rubbed in like sunscreen . Meeting his gaze , I was arrested by the color of his eyes , the bittersweet dark of Venezuelan chocolate . As I stared into those familiar eyes , I knew exactly who he was . "
71879	71887	71888	71888	you	131	" I said with an abashed grin . "Thank

71922	71950	71917	71917	Travis	131	" You 're a lot prettier than my usual crashers , Ella . Stick with me and I 'll make sure they do n't throw you out . "The

72364	72395	72280	72280	Joe	198	" Churchill asked , inhaling the fragrance as if it were the finest perfume . Hardy admitted nothing , just regarded him with a devilish glint in his blue eyes . "

73137	73288	73082	73082	I	0	" I heard Jack say behind me , his voice quiet but firm . I turned toward him , my pulse rioting . A strong arm slid around my back . Jack 's head lowered , his lips brushing my cheek in a social kiss . Nothing untoward , just two friends meeting . But then he moved lower and brushed a brief , hot kiss at the side of my throat . It was unspeakably personal , a declaration of intimacy . Astonished that Jack would do such a thing in front of his family 's collective gaze , I felt myself turn white then scarlet , my face changing colors like a neon sign in a diner window . Shaken , I saw Haven and Liberty exchange a quick , significant glance . Keeping an arm around me , Jack reached out to shake his father 's hand . "

73603	73611	73600	73600	he	122	" or stay here for more grilling ? "

73704	73799	73702	73702	him	2313	" I glanced uneasily at his hard profile . This was a version of Jack I had n't seen before . He had always had a sort of I - don't - give - a - shit cockiness , an air of not letting anything matter too deeply . But that was gone . Right now he was angry all the way down to the marrow . Something mattered very much . We reached the dance floor . Jack took me into his arms in a natural , experienced movement . The band was playing "
73804	73905	73702	73702	him	2313	" as if they were all having the same long , bluesy dream . Jack 's shoulder was hard beneath my hand , his arms steady as he led me without hesitancy . He was a seriously good dancer , his movements fluid but not showy . I wished I could have told his mother that those long - ago dance lessons had paid off handsomely . I concentrated on relaxing and following him , keeping my gaze on the place where his shirt collar opened . The lowest point of the vee revealed a tantalizing hint of chest hair . "Dane
73912	73932	73910	73910	you	1651	" Jack said flatly . I was relieved at this blunt opening gambit , eager to get things resolved . "
73954	73981	73949	73949	You	1651	oof!"Jack had stopped abruptly , and I had walked straight into him . Glancing up at his face , I realized what conclusion he had drawn . "
73987	73992	73949	73949	You	1651	" I said hastily . "
74019	74045	74011	74011	Jack	122	"He loosened his grip immediately and tried to moderate his breathing . We resumed dancing for a full minute before he brought himself to ask , "

74138	74213	74214	74216	a big talker	1657	"I was privately amused . And I was aware of a new kind of power , a seductive power , over someone who was stronger , worldlier , more unpredictable , more testosterone - fueled than any man I 'd ever known before . It was like sitting behind the wheel to test a race car . Scary and exhilarating all at once , especially for someone who had never liked to travel fast . "You're
74235	74278	74224	74224	you	1658	action?"He glanced down at me sharply . I did n't think either of us could believe I had said it . And from the look in his eyes , it was clear I was about to get all the action I could handle .

I had n't yet known Jack long enough to feel much comfortable ease with him.—our relationship needed to be broken in . But I did tell Jack about the talk I 'd had with Dane , and he listened closely . I realized that although Jack comprehended Dane 's views , on a visceral level he did n't get him at all . "
74788	74792	74793	74793	He	1673	" Jack said . "

75644	75690	75616	75616	his	122	"My breathless laugh ended with a gasp as Jack reached out and tugged gently at the tiny snaps that held the front of my dress closed . The sides listed open , unveiling the full round shapes of my breasts , my white silk panties . "Look
75694	75698	75616	75616	his	122	" he whispered . "
75709	75875	75616	75616	his	122	" He eased the dress off my shoulders until it dropped to the floor . A severe blush spread from head to toe as I stood there in high heels and panties . Clumsy with urgency , I tugged at his black shirt , and Jack moved to help me strip it off . His chest was powerful and emphatically defined , the large muscles mortared with smaller ones in between . Hesitantly I touched the rough dark hair on his chest , drew my fingers through it . He felt maddeningly good . I let him pull me closer , his arms wrapping around me , and my hands slipped around to his back . The tickling brush of hair against my breasts , the long , delicious kisses , flooded me with sensation . Feeling the way I had molded myself against his body , my hips urgently cradling the shape of his erection , Jack eased me back with a smothered laugh . "
75879	75883	75884	75884	I	0	""I need you , "
75921	75945	75913	75913	Jack	122	" . . .you know if you start something with me , it 'll go to a place you and Dane never went . "
76017	76023	76008	76008	He	122	"I guess . . . , "
76030	76042	76008	76008	He	122	" I do n't feel all - the - way safe . ""Probably
76048	76064	76024	76024	I	0	" Jack hooked his fingers at the side of my panties , drawing them down . "
76083	76119	76074	76074	you	0	"Feeling dazed , I let him take off the panties , and I obeyed his urging to sit on the edge of the bed . I tried to reach for one of the silver shoes . "No
76121	76154	76074	76074	you	0	" Jack murmured , sinking to his haunches in front of me . He pushed my thighs open with his hands , his face intent . I tried to close against him . "
76158	76427	76074	76074	you	0	" I said bashfully But Jack pinned me in place , and despite my wriggling objection , he leaned forward and pressed his mouth against me , there , in a full searching kiss . In a matter of seconds I was moaning , frozen in place as the pleasure surged and buzzed with each silky flick of his tongue . It went on and on until the desire was too much , and I clutched his head hard and close . He took my wrists , pulling them down to my sides , and just held them there . Manacled in his grip , spread open , I breathed in low cries as he gnawed and licked and ate gently into the softness , and the sensation built until my inner muscles began a frantic , involuntary clenching . Jack pulled back , leaving me floundering . I was weak , desperate , my pulse brutal in its force . As he stood between my thighs , I reached for the front of his pants to unfasten them . My hands felt encumbered , as if I were wearing mittens . Jack was heavily aroused , his erection taut and dusky . I touched him in wonder , gripped the pulsing heft , breathed against the engorged head . He went still , and I heard a faint groan . He tolerated my careful touch , the warm suction of my mouth as I tried to taste as much of him as possible . But in a matter of seconds he was easing me away , muttering , "
76450	76755	76447	76447	Ella	104	."Stripping off his clothes , he joined me on the bed and tugged me toward the center of the mattress . He took interminable minutes to remove my shoes , unbuckling the tiny straps when it would have sufficed to slip them over my heels . And then he was over me again , his mouth at my breasts , one of his thighs nudging insistently between mine . I reached up to him , my palm flattening on the flexing surface of his back . His mouth found mine , and I went pliant , supine , moaning and resistless . Clasping me securely , he eased us to our sides , his hands venturing everywhere . Our entwined bodies turned in a slow revolution across the wide bed . It was a sensual altercation , the way we rubbed and slid , with me trying to entice him inside and Jack resisting . He delayed and teased and tormented my aching flesh until I begged him in a hoarse whisper to do it now , I was ready , now , now — He rolled me to my back and spread my legs wide . I complied with an expectant groan , tilting my hips up . He eased inside me , and the entire world seemed to stop as I felt the low , thick slide . I clutched at his shoulders , my nails indenting his skin . Pushing deeper into my shrinking body , Jack murmured that he would be gentle , just relax , relax . . . and he went deeper and held , while I felt myself yield by slow degrees . His face was right over mine , his eyes as dark and bright as hellfire . He stroked the hair back from my forehead . "
76767	76842	76756	76756	You	1684	" he whispered . I nodded as if in a trance . His lips caught at mine . He nudged within the wet constriction of my body , gentle in the way only a big man could be . He was sensitive to every breath and heartbeat , searching for a perfect bias of flesh and movement , and when he found it , I cried out helplessly . Jack nearly purred in satisfaction . "
76849	76853	76843	76843	You	1684	Ella?""Yes . Yes . "
77072	77074	77075	77075	Jack	122	"Rest , "

77833	77855	77856	77856	She	251	"Jack looked away from me , his profile as hard and perfect as a face on a new - minted coin . "

79357	79507	79297	79297	him	122	ER."I chuckled , and Jack pressed his cheek against the soft bounce of my breast . His hot breath rushed against the distended tip . Slowly his mouth opened over the rosy flesh , his tongue circling . Sliding my arms around his neck , I kissed the thick , damp locks of his hair . He lifted his mouth and took the nipple between his fingers , clamping softly while he moved to kiss the other breast , and my hips pressed upward into his weight . In a matter of seconds I was steaming . He browsed over me as if I were some lavish buffet , nibbling and licking and kissing , lifting and turning me to make certain there was nothing he had missed . I lay on my stomach , gripping fistfuls of amber quilt as he took my hips and hoisted them upward . "This
79510	79516	79297	79297	him	122	" I heard him whisper . "

His hand slid beneath me , fingers going to the exact place I needed them . Caught deliciously between his body and his hand , I pushed upward invitingly , and he went as deep as I could take him . His mouth went to my back , kissing the top of my spine . He waited until I pushed up again before he thrust . I realized he was letting me set the rhythm , his every motion a counterpoint to mine . I arched and gasped as I took him , worked him , feeling him shove deeper while those gentle fingers tantalized and teased . Sensations flowed together until I could no longer recognize their separate sources . I gripped his thick muscled wrists , one braced near my head , the other down between my thighs , and I held him there as I went over the edge . The climax was lush and brimming , and each time I thought it had died down , it gave another voluptuous kick . I felt Jack shudder , the heat of him flooding me in violent pulses . When he finally caught his breath , he muttered a few curses . I had to bury a shaky laugh in the covers , because I understood . It felt as if , somehow , a thing that was entirely ordinary had been reinvented , and the two of us along with it . WE DRESSED CLUMSILY AND WENT DOWN TO MY APART - ment , and Jack overpaid the babysitter , who pretended not to notice how disheveled we were . After checking on Luke , who was down for the count , I told Jack that he was welcome to spend the night with me , except the baby would probably wake him up . "No
79870	79879	80014	80014	He	1707	" Jack replied , kicking off his shoes . "
79889	79912	80014	80014	He	1707	" He stripped off his jeans and T - shirt , climbed into bed , and watched me change into my pajamas . "
79919	79962	80014	80014	He	1707	" he said . I smiled at the sight of him leaning back against the brass headboard with his hands clasped comfortably behind his head . He was brawny and tan , incongruously masculine against all the frilly antique fabric and lace . "I
79970	79975	80014	80014	He	1707	" I told him . "Why

I actually found it difficult to stay still in my car seat — I was tempted to wriggle like a child on the last day of school with five minutes to go before summer began . For the first time in my life , there was no other place I would rather have been and no one else I wanted to be with . I twisted around to look at Luke 's car seat , which was facing backward . "I

82376	82653	82312	82312	they	1751	"AT CRUISING SPEED THE RIDE WAS QUIET AND SMOOTH , the hull of the Last Fling cutting decisively through the dark blue water . I sat on the flybridge , one of the boat 's two helms , on a wide cushioned bench seat next to the skipper 's chair . Luke was bundled in a blue nylon life jacket with a huge rounded notation collar . Either it was more comfortable than it looked , or the baby was distracted by the new sounds and sensations of being on a boat , because he was surprisingly unfussy . Holding the baby on my lap , I put my legs up on the bench . As Jack took us around the lake , pointing out homes , mini islands , a bald eagle hunting for catfish , I sipped from a glass of chilled white wine that tasted like pears . I was overtaken by the kind of ease that could only come from being in a boat in sunny weather , the air humid and beneficent in my lungs , the warm breeze rushing continuously over us . We anchored in a cove shaded by abundant pine and cedar , the shoreline still undeveloped . I unpacked an enormous picnic basket , discovering a jar of creamed honey , crisp pale baguettes , disks of snowy - white goat cheese and a wedge of Humboldt with a thin line of volcanic ash , containers of salad , sections of gourmet sandwiches , and cookies the size of hubcaps . We ate slowly and finished the bottle of wine , and I fed and changed Luke . "He
82660	82717	82312	82312	they	1751	" I said , cuddling the sleepy baby . We took him inside the air - conditioned cabin to one of the downstairs staterooms . I laid him carefully in the center of the double berth . Luke blinked at me , his eyes staying closed longer each time , until finally he was fast asleep . "
82723	82767	82721	82721	Luke	117	" I whispered , kissing his head . Straightening , I stretched my back and glanced at Jack , who was waiting near the doorway . He had propped his shoulders against the wall , and stood with his hands in his pockets . "Come
82770	82816	82312	82312	they	1751	" he murmured . The sound of his voice in the darkness sent a pleasant shiver across my skin . He took me to the other stateroom , cool and shadowy , and scented of polished wood and ozone and the slightest hint of diesel . "I
82821	82835	82838	82838	you	1758	" I asked , slipping off my shoes and crawling onto the bed . "You
82844	82947	82948	82948	I	0	"We lay on our sides facing each other , skin releasing heat , retaining the flavor of salt as our perspiration dried . Jack stared at me steadily . His hand lifted to the side of my face , the tip of his middle finger following the wing of a brow , the soft ridge of a cheekbone . He touched me with absolute absorption , like an explorer who had discovered a rare and fragile artifact . Remembering the devilish patience of those hands , all the intimate ways he had touched me last night , I flushed in the semidarkness . "
82952	83357	82948	82948	I	0	" I whispered . All my senses turned acute as Jack slowly undressed me . He covered the erect tip of my breast with his mouth , his tongue a soothing swirl . His hand moved to the small of my back , finding the sensitive hollows of my spine , caressing until I was filled with hot sparks . Jack took off his own clothes , his body sleek and unbelievably strong . He arranged me in revealing positions , each one more open and vulnerable than the last , exploring with his hands and mouth until I was breathing in ragged gasps . Pinning my wrists to the mattress , he stared down at me . I moaned and tilted my hips upward , waiting tensely , my arms straining in his grasp . I gasped as I felt the low , heavy penetration , his body sliding over mine until I was stroked inside and out . Hard flesh over pale curves , heat against coolness . Every thrust translated skin into sensation , form into fire . Jack held still , panting , trying to stave off the climax , make it last . Letting go of my wrists , he laced all of his fingers through all of mine with painstaking deliberation . I lifted up against him , wanting to go on , and he inhaled sharply , trying to hold back . But I kept nudging upward , pushing him , until finally he lost all restraint and began to thrust deep and steady , taking my sobs into his mouth as if he could taste them . Since I could n't hold him with my arms , I used my legs , twining them around his back . He gritted his teeth and buried himself over and over , stoking the sensation , driving me into long , silky spasms , and then he let himself come , too , growling his pleasure against my throat . Afterward we lay together , limbs tangled , my head resting on his shoulder . How strange it was to lie there with a man who was n't Dane . Stranger still was that it felt so natural . I thought of what Dane had told me , that although he did n't want a traditional relationship , it was okay if I wanted to explore that with Jack . "Jack

83501	83528	83488	83488	Jack	122	" Let 's try it with just you and me . No other people , no distractions . Let 's find out what that 's like . Okay?""Okay

And right now it was nice to have the help . I nodded . He handed Luke to me , went to the table where he had left his wallet , keys , and phone . In about two minutes he had Gottler on the phone .

88643	88688	88690	88690	honey	661	"As I cuddled Luke and struggled with my thoughts , I was relieved when Liberty 's nanny emerged from the house with a robust , handsome toddler . The boy was dressed in a swimsuit and a T - shirt printed with cartoon lobsters . "Matthew

88746	88825	88732	88732	she	2812	" He responded with an enchanting wide grin , conversing with his mother in a few garbled sentences , his plump arms wrapped around her neck . After giving us a cursory inspection , Matthew decided that playing in the sand was far more interesting than the new baby . Liberty stripped down to her swimsuit and took her son to the edge of the water , where they sat and began to fill a bucket with sand . "
88836	88840	88826	88826	Ella	104	" she called . "
88845	88875	88826	88826	Ella	104	"I was dressed in a printed halter top and matching Bermuda shorts , but I had packed a swimsuit . Pulling it from the diaper bag , I said , "

88976	89299	88951	88951	Liberty	252	" I went into the house , relishing the coolness of the kitchen , and found a small bathroom with earthy - hued striped walls and a stone vessel sink and a black - framed mirror . I changed into my pink swimsuit , a retro - styled one - piece . Padding barefoot through the kitchen , carrying my clothes , I heard the sound of voices , one of them Jack 's deep murmur . The voices were accompanied by hammering and sawing , and the occasional squeal of a power drill . I followed the sound to a partially opened door that led to the spacious garage , where a huge shop fan circulated the warm air . The space was brilliantly lit from the secondhand sunlight that bounced in through the open garage doors . Tapping the door a little wider , I watched unobserved as Jack , Gage , and Carrington worked on the wooden skiff , which was propped up on padded sawhorses . Both Jack and Gage had removed their shirts in the heat . I wondered wryly how many women would have paid good money to see the two Travis brothers dressed only in jeans , all sun - burnished muscles and long , lean bodies . As my gaze lingered on Jack 's sweat - glittered back , I had a flash of recent memory , my hands urgently gripping those hard muscles on either side of his spine , and a pleasant riff of awareness went through me . Carrington was busy spreading a thick layer of glue on the last of three strips of wood that would be joined and fastened to the top edge of the skiff as a gunnel . I had to smile at the sight of Gage crouched beside her , murmuring instructions , holding back one of the braids that threatened to drag through the glue . "
89308	89324	89325	89325	Caleb	268	" the girl said , squeezing a huge bottle of wood glue with both hands , "

89352	89371	89349	89349	Gage	142	" Here , put more glue on the edge . Better to use too much than not enough . ""Like

89496	89528	89529	89529	you	122	"Because I was a terrible boy once , and that 's probably what I would have said . But I 'd have been dead wrong . Girls are great at fishing . ""Are

89547	89567	89604	89604	you	122	" Together Jack and Gage lifted the assembled wood strips and fit them to the edge of the boat . "Sweetheart

89702	89725	89697	89697	Carrington	263	"That 's right . And I 'm here to tell you , some of the best anglers in the world are women . ""How

She was a gorgeous mess , her eyes smoked with heavy dark liner , cheeks slicked with tears , her slender fingers knotted around a wad of tissues . The pale , stick - straight locks of her hair needed a good brushing . I was struck by the contrast between her woeful little - girl expression and her stylish outfit , a short white skirt , a slim - fitting black top that conformed perfectly to her uplifted breasts , a neat little cropped jacket , and strappy sandals with four - inch heels . Photographed just this way , smudgy makeup included , she would have made the perfect perfume ad , a sexy waif . I did n't think for one second that Jack had invited her there , or that he still wanted her . But I could n't decide if this were a situation best left for him to handle alone , or if he needed backup . I glanced at Jack with a quick grimace . "

And I 'm going to take the liberty of speaking for him by saying that I 'm sure he still cares about you as a human being , but nothing more than that . So now , the best thing you can do for Jack , and yourself , and everyone , is to go home to Pete and ask him what you can do about your marriage . "

Not a lot of anger ; just a small , potent kindling , enough to burn out any remaining hint of optimism about my own future . Had Tara never asked me to do this , I would be unaware of this level of pain . And if I ever had to go through this again , someone was going to have to put me in a dirt - filled pot and start watering me three times a week . A knock at the door , three soft raps . Carrying Luke , I went to answer it . And there was Tara , more beautiful than I remembered , with a few hard edges that did n't detract from her looks at all . She was slender , beautifully dressed in a white hammered - silk top and skinny black pants , and black flats with silver studs . Her white - blond hair fell loose in casual waves , and oversized hoops hung from her ears . And her wrist glittered with what had to be a fifteen - carat tennis bracelet . Tara came into the apartment with a wordless exclamation , not trying to take Luke from me , just putting her long arms around us both . I had forgotten how much taller than me she was . I remembered the time in our teens when I realized she had shot up past me in height , and I had complained that she should n't have gotten a growth spurt before I had . And she 'd teased me by saying she 'd gotten both our growth spurts . The embrace reminded me of a thousand memories . It reminded me how much I loved her .

103185	103194	103203	103203	He	234	" She frowned as she saw my face . "
103227	103258	103259	103259	you	104	""Maybe you feel safe , but you 're not . You have nothing to bargain with . He can dump you at any time and leave you high and dry . ""And
103271	103275	103268	103269	Jack Travis	122	" she asked . "

103316	103421	103422	103422	he	2092	"No , you do n't depend on anyone . You do n't trust anyone or believe in anything . Well , I 'm different . I do n't want to be alone — I need a man , and there 's nothing wrong with that . And Noah 's the best man I 've ever known . He 's good and smart , and he prays all the time . And I bet he 's got more money than Jack Travis , and he knows everyone , Ella . Politicians and business people , and . . . just everyone . He 's amazing . ""Will

103521	103527	103514	103514	you	0	Ella?"I shook my head slowly . "
103532	103544	103545	103545	You	0	"She dashed at the moisture beneath her eyes with her fingertips . "

103590	103612	103587	103587	driver	2097	"I surrendered Luke , who had fallen asleep , and gathered up the diaper bag , tucking the board book inside . "

103739	103749	103737	103737	Luke	117	"I was so stricken that I could hardly speak . "
103754	103772	103737	103737	Luke	117	" I leaned over the carrier and clumsily pressed my lips to the sleeping baby 's head . "
103777	103858	103775	103775	Luke	117	" I whispered . And then I stood back and watched my sister carry Luke away . She took him onto the elevator , and the doors opened and closed , and they were gone . Moving like an old woman , I went back into the apartment . I could n't seem to think of what to do . Mechanically I wandered into the kitchen and began to make tea that I knew I was n't going to drink . "It
103862	103867	103775	103775	Luke	117	" I said aloud . "
103872	104175	103775	103775	Luke	117	"Luke would wake up and I would n't be there . He would wonder why I had left him . The sound of my voice would fade from his memory . My boy . My baby . I accidentally scalded my fingers with the hot water , but the pain did n't really register . Some part of my mind worried over how badly I was dissociating . I wanted Jack . . . he might know how to break through the layers of ice around me . . . but at the same time , the thought of being with him filled me with dread . I changed into my pajamas , and for the rest of the afternoon I watched TV without seeing or hearing anything . The phone rang , and the answering machine picked up . Before I glanced at the caller ID , I knew it was Jack . There was no way I could talk to him , or anyone , at the moment . I turned the volume down completely . Recognizing that I needed to go through the motions of a normal routine , I made soup with powdered chicken broth and consumed it slowly , and followed it with a glass of wine . The phone rang again , and again , and I let the answering machine take it each time , until a half - dozen messages had been left . Just as I considered going to bed , there was a knock at the door . It was Haven . Her dark brown eyes , so like her brother 's , were filled with concern . She made no attempt to come inside , just slipped her hands in the pockets of her jeans and regarded me with infinite patience . "
104178	104183	104184	104185	The baby	2318	" she said softly . "

104312	104327	104277	104277	He	2318	" I 'm not outside on the ledge or anything . Just really tired . ""Yeah

104353	104358	104376	104376	Her	2100	something?"I shook my head . "

104447	104477	104376	104376	Her	2100	" I had no intention of talking about Luke ever again . It was a closed chapter in my life . She reached out and touched my shoulder lightly . "

105340	105386	105321	105321	They	2112	"Haven hung up , and I stood frowning at the receiver in my hand . I reached up and rubbed the back of my neck , which was prickling . I dialed Jack 's cell phone again , and his voice mail picked up immediately . "
105392	105400	105321	105321	They	2112	" I said , my voice taut . "
105410	105465	105321	105321	They	2112	"After watching the weather channel for a few more minutes , I picked up my purse and left the apartment . It felt weird to go out without all the paraphernalia I usually dragged around because of Luke . I went up to Haven and Hardy 's apartment , and Haven let me in . "I'm

105780	105814	105901	105901	she	199	"I knew nothing about boats . I did n't even know what questions to ask . But I was trying desperately to think of an explanation for why Jack and Joe were missing . "
105839	105843	105901	105901	she	199	" Hardy nodded . "
105861	105868	105869	105869	Haven	199	""Jack and Joe are really experienced , "
105872	105896	105897	105897	She	199	" They know all about safety procedures , and neither of them would take unnecessary chances . I 'm sure they 're okay . "
105912	105923	105901	105901	she	199	"What if they did n't manage to outrun the weather ? "
105929	105936	105937	105937	she	199	"It 's not a bad storm , "
105940	105959	105960	105960	She	199	" And if they got caught in it , they would just batten down and ride it out . "
105967	105982	105960	105960	She	199	" I 'm going to call Gage and see if anyone 's with Dad . "For

106159	106179	106180	106180	you	2134	" He drew her between his thighs as he leaned against the sofa , and she nestled against him . "Including
106182	106190	106191	106191	You	2134	" she said , her voice muffled . "

106216	106225	106204	106204	his	2134	" And there 's no getting over me . "The
106249	106265	106244	106244	Hardy	189	" Cates here . Gage , how 's it going ? They found 'em yet ? "
106305	106309	106310	106310	Hardy	189	" Got it , "
106314	106363	106364	106364	He	189	" Do they need more choppers ? Because if so , I can get as many as . . . I know . But it 's like trying to find two fucking pennies someone dropped in the backyard . I know . Okay , we 'll sit tight . "
106369	106373	106374	106374	Haven	199	"What is it ? "
106410	106417	106418	106418	he	189	" They found a debris field , "
106425	106436	106421	106421	himself	189	" And what 's left of the boat is submerged . "My
106459	106468	106448	106448	he	189	"So they 're doing a search and rescue ? "
106481	106498	106478	106478	He	189	" The Coast Guard is sending out a couple of Tupperwolfs — those big orange choppers . ""Debris

106534	106630	106455	106455	he	189	"All three of us struggled to take in the news . I put my hand up to my mouth , breathing against the screen of my fingers . I wondered where Jack was at that very moment , if he was hurt , if he was drowning . No , do n't think about that . But for a second it felt as if I were drowning , too . I could actually feel the cold black water folding over my head , pushing me down where I could n't breathe or see or hear . "Hardy
106632	106650	106455	106455	he	189	" I said , surprised by how rational I sounded , when there was chaos inside me . "
106659	106664	106455	106455	he	189	explode?"He sounded excessively calm . "
106715	106738	106739	106739	They	2140	" He looked down at Haven 's face . She was flushed , her mouth twisting as she tried not to cry . "
106745	106753	106739	106739	They	2140	" he murmured , pulling her closer . "
106771	106776	106777	106777	Haven	199	""It 's rough water , "
106783	106792	106793	106793	he	0	"There 's a lot of movement out there , "
106796	106824	106777	106777	Haven	199	" According to Gage , the captain who 's coordinating the rescue operation is looking at a computer model to figure out where they might have drifted . ""What
106835	106840	106777	106777	Haven	199	" I asked unsteadily . "
106859	106868	106777	106777	Haven	199	jacket?"The question was greeted with a frozen silence . "
106872	106877	106777	106777	Haven	199	" Hardy said eventually . "
106882	107134	106777	106777	Haven	199	"I nodded and sat heavily on a nearby chair , my mind buzzing . You need time , Haven had told me , when I 'd confided my thoughts about going back to Austin . Give it some time , and you 'll know what to do . But now there was no time . There might never be . If I could only have five minutes with Jack . . . I would have given years of my life for the chance to tell him how much he meant to me . How much I wanted him . Loved him . I thought of his dazzling grin , his midnight eyes , the beautiful severity of his face when he was sleeping . The thought of never seeing him again , never feeling the sweetness of his mouth against mine , caused an ache I could hardly bear . How many hours I 'd spent with Jack in silence , resting together , all words restrained by the limits of what my heart would allow . All those chances to be honest with him , and I 'd taken none of them . I loved him , and he might never know . I understood finally that the thing I should have feared most was not loss , but never loving . The price for safety was the regret I felt at this moment . And yet I would have to live with it for the rest of my life . "I
107141	107146	106777	106777	Haven	199	" Haven burst out . "

107197	107208	107194	107194	He	2144	" Do you want to go wait with your dad and Liberty?"Haven
107212	107231	107194	107194	He	2144	" If I 'm going to go crazy waiting , I may as well do it around them . "We

107292	107307	107283	107283	She	199	" Hi , Gage ? What is it ? Have you found out anything ? "
107321	107354	107355	107355	She	199	" Oh my God . I ca n't believe — which one ? They do n't know ? Shit . Ca n't someone — yes , okay , we 'll be there . "

107369	107403	107404	107404	She	199	" They found them , and picked them up , and they 're medevacing both of them straight there . One of them seems to be in good condition , but the other — "
107418	107426	107427	107427	she	199	" Other one 's in bad shape , "
107432	107435	107427	107427	she	199	"Which one ? "

108188	108240	108176	108176	she	199	" even if they both make it , there could be a rough time ahead . We could be talking amputation , or brain damage , or . . . God , I do n't even know . No one would blame you if you decided you could n't handle it . ""I've
108246	108252	108176	108176	she	199	" I said without hesitation . "
108300	108319	108338	108338	she	2189	"I had n't meant to distress her , but Haven surprised me by giving a few muffled sobs . "Haven

108424	108459	108422	108422	I	0	" I began , but through the open doorway , Haven caught sight of movement in the waiting room . A door on the opposite side had opened , and a doctor came in . "Oh
108462	108558	108338	108338	she	2189	" Haven muttered , nearly dropping her coffee as she hurried into the room . My stomach dropped . I was paralyzed , the fingers of one hand digging into the door frame as I watched the Travis family gather around the doctor . I watched his face , and their faces , trying to divine any reaction . If either of the brothers had died , I thought the doctor would say so immediately . But he was speaking quietly , and no one in the family revealed any emotion other than bleached anxiety . "Ella
108560	108671	108683	108683	God	148	"The sound was so quiet , I barely heard it through the blood - rush in my ears . I turned to look down the hallway . A man was coming toward me , his lean form clad in a pair of baggy scrub pants and a loose T - shirt . His arm was bandaged with silver - gray burn wrap . I knew the set of those shoulders , the way he moved . Jack . My eyes blurred , and I felt my pulse escalate to a painful throbbing . I began to shake from the effects of trying to encompass too much feeling , too fast . "Is
108675	108679	108673	108673	you	2190	" I choked . "Yes
108688	108792	108685	108685	Ella	104	."I was breaking down , every breath shattering . I gripped my elbows with my hands , crying harder as Jack drew closer . I could n't move . I was terrified that I was hallucinating , conjuring an image of what I wanted most , that if I reached out I would find nothing but empty space . But Jack was there , solid and real , reaching around me with hard , strong arms . The contact with him was electrifying . I flattened against him , unable to get close enough . He murmured as I sobbed against his chest . "
108812	108944	108945	108945	I	0	."But the relief of touching him , being close to him , had caused me to unravel . Not too late . The thought spurred a rush of euphoria . Jack was alive , and whole , and I would take nothing for granted ever again . I fumbled beneath the hem of his T - shirt and found the warm skin of his back . My fingertips encountered the edge of another bandage . He kept his arms firmly around me as if he understood that I needed the confining pressure , the feel of him surrounding me as our bodies relayed silent messages . Don't let go . I'm right here . Tremors kept running along my entire frame . My teeth chattered , making it hard to talk . "
108955	108977	108945	108945	I	0	"Jack 's mouth , usually so soft , was rough and chapped against my cheek , his jaw scratchy with bristle . "
108986	109024	108978	108978	I	0	" His voice was hoarse . I hid my face against his neck , breathing him in . His familiar scent had been obliterated by the antiseptic pungency of antiseptic burn dressings , and heavy saltwater brine . "
109030	109060	109027	109027	you	0	" Sniffling , I reached farther over his back , investigating the extent of the bandage . His fingers tangled in the smooth , soft locks of my hair . "
109073	109083	108978	108978	I	0	" I felt his cheek tauten with a smile . "
109092	109108	108978	108978	I	0	"We were both quiet for a moment . I realized he was trembling , too . "
109115	109144	109109	109109	I	0	" I said , and that started a whole new rush of tears , because I was so unholy glad to be able to say it to him . "

109191	109194	109178	109178	He	122	"You did ? "
109201	109224	109198	109198	He	122	" I figured I could n't love you as much as I do , without you feeling something for me , too . "
109290	109304	109280	109280	I	0	" Your family 's in there . Why are you in the hallway ? "
109317	109330	109332	109332	his	122	" They 're . . . they 're letting you walk around like this?"Jack
109335	109377	109332	109332	his	122	" They parked me in a room around the corner to wait for a couple more tests . I asked if anyone had told you I was okay , and nobody knew for sure . So I came to find you . ""You

109454	109468	109469	109469	They	2195	Joe?"A shadow crossed Jack 's face . Suddenly he looked young and anxious . "
109507	109523	109524	109524	I	0	""This is a world - class hospital with the best doctors and the best equipment , "
109537	109558	109560	109560	his	122	" They 'll fix him . They 'll do whatever they have to . But . . . was he burned badly?"He
109563	109586	109560	109560	his	122	" The only reason I got singed a little was because I had to push through some burning debris to find him . ""Oh
109592	109625	109588	109588	Jack	122	" I wanted to hear everything he 'd been through , every detail . I wanted to comfort him in every way possible . But there would be time for that later . "
109646	109654	109643	109643	he	417	" I gave him a threatening glance . "
109674	109678	109679	109679	Jack	122	""They can wait . "
109687	109706	109679	109679	Jack	122	" You should see the redheaded nurse who was wheeling me around . Bossiest woman I ever met . "We
109713	109716	109717	109717	I	0	" Hey , "
109724	109730	109735	109736	his family	3377	" Look who I found . "Jack
109792	109795	109796	109796	Churchill	124	"You okay ? "
109803	109807	109796	109796	Churchill	124	"Yeah , Dad . ""Good
109809	109872	109796	109796	Churchill	124	" And Churchill touched his son 's face with a sort of gentle cuffing pat . Jack 's jaw quivered , and he cleared his throat roughly . He seemed relieved to turn to Hardy , with whom he exchanged a manly half - hug back - pat . Gage was last , taking Jack by the shoulders and surveying him intently . "
109878	109882	109883	109883	you	122	" he commented . "Fuck
109885	109940	109796	109796	Churchill	124	" Jack said , and they embraced each other roughly , the two dark heads close together . Jack gave him a few forceful thumps on the back , but Gage , mindful of his brother 's condition , was far gentler . Jack swayed a little and was immediately pushed in a chair . "He
109944	109963	110032	110032	Gage	142	" I said , going to the water dispenser in the corner and filling up a paper cup . "Why
109971	109997	109998	109998	They	2204	" Churchill demanded , hovering over him . Jack showed him his hand , where an IV needle was still inserted and anchored with tape . "
110029	110031	110032	110032	Gage	142	""Pussy , "
110049	110053	110054	110054	Jack	122	"How 's Joe ? "
110085	110192	110081	110081	Gage	142	" The doctor said Joe has a concussion and a mild case of blast lung injury . It may take a while for the lungs to get back to speed , maybe up to a year . But it could have been a lot worse . Joe 's in respiratory distress and has borderline hypoxia — so they 're treating him with supplemental high - flow oxygen . He 'll be spending some serious time in ICU . And he can hear out of one ear , but not the other . At some point a specialist will tell us if the hearing loss is permanent . ""That
110196	110200	110201	110201	Joe	198	" Jack said . "
110206	110220	110201	110201	Joe	198	"Gage grinned briefly , but sobered as he stared at his younger brother . "
110234	110238	110201	110201	Joe	198	""Where?""Abdomen , mostly . "Jack
110242	110244	110201	110201	Joe	198	" How bad?"''We
110249	110251	110253	110253	Jack	122	""Shit . "
110261	110268	110253	110253	Jack	122	" I was afraid of that . ""Before
110274	110278	110253	110253	Jack	122	" Liberty said , "
110286	110532	110280	110280	you	2205	Jack?"Jack gestured for me to come to him , and he pulled me into his warm side as he spoke . It had been a clear morning , he said . Fishing had been decent , and they had gotten an early start back to the marina . But on the way they 'd seen a huge brown seaweed mat , about an acre in size . The mat had formed its own ecosystem with algae , barnacles , and small fish , all living amid the accumulated driftwood and mermaid purses . Figuring there was good fishing around or under the mat , the brothers had killed the engine and glided up to the seaweed . In just a few minutes Jack had hooked a Dorado , the rod nearly doubling and the reel screaming off a bunch of line as the acrobatic fish took off . It leapt from the water , revealing itself to be a five - footer , a monster , and Jack had followed around the boat to keep the line from catching . He had shouted to Joe to start the boat and go toward the fish , otherwise it would gain too much line . And just as he started to reel it in , Joe had started the engine and there had been an explosion . Jack fell silent at that point , blinking as he struggled to recall what had happened next . Hardy murmured , "
110540	110544	110269	110269	they	2204	"Jack nodded slowly . "
110604	110616	110617	110617	He	198	" He looked agitated , his words coming in choppy bursts . "
110707	110713	110714	110714	Churchill	124	""And the weather came in , "
110720	110785	110717	110717	Jack	122	" Wind picked up , water got rough , and we were getting pushed away from the boat . I tried to stay with it , but it took too much energy . So I just held on to Joe , and the cooler , and I swore I would n't let go no matter how long it took for someone to find us . ""Was
110789	110793	110717	110717	Jack	122	" I asked . "Yeah
110817	110825	110809	110809	Joe	198	" Jack worked up a rueful smile . "
110843	110850	110829	110829	he	198	" He paused as everyone chuckled . "
110889	110900	110863	110863	I	0	" A stark , endless hesitation . He swallowed hard . "
110934	110949	110931	110931	I	0	" His voice broke , and he dropped his head , unable to finish . "You
110955	110987	110931	110931	I	0	" I whispered , putting my hand on his back , while Haven handed him a wad of Kleenex . It was too much , making him relive it so soon . "Thanks
110989	111006	110931	110931	I	0	" Jack said gruffly after a minute , blowing his nose and letting out a sigh . "Here
111010	111047	111048	111049	Mr. Travis	131	" A strident , accusatory voice came from the doorway , and we all looked up to behold a stout , redhaired nurse with a ruddy complexion , pushing an empty wheelchair into the waiting room . "
111066	111071	111072	111072	Jack	122	'"I took a break , "
111080	111135	111076	111077	The nurse	424	" That 's the last break you 'll get for a while — you 're getting a new IV needle put in , and you 're going for your MRI , and I may think up some extra tests to pay you back for scaring me half to death . Disappearing like that . . .""I
111139	111148	111076	111077	The nurse	424	" I said , urging Jack to stand . "
111159	111190	111076	111077	The nurse	424	"Jack shot me a narrow - eyed glance over his shoulder as he shuffled to the wheelchair . The nurse stared incredulously at his scrub pants and T - shirt . "

112968	113046	112963	112963	he	122	" I said reasonably . Climbing out of bed , I went to his dresser and pulled out a T - shirt , which hung past the tops of my thighs when I put it on . When I turned to face Jack , he was standing right there , tucking a lock of my hair behind my ear , and gazing down at me . No one had ever looked at me with such tender concern . "
113052	113086	113050	113050	Luke	117	" he said gently . And as I stared into those velvety - dark eyes , I knew I could share anything with him . He would listen , and he would understand . "
113094	113499	113050	113050	Luke	117	" I said , and went to the kitchen . Jack had set a cup and saucer beside the coffeemaker . I saw a piece of notepaper , folded lengthwise , standing in the empty cup . Perplexed , I opened the note and read : Dear Miss Independent , I've decided that of all the women I 've ever known , you are the only one I will ever love more than hunting , fishing , football , and power tools . You may not know this , but the other time I asked you to marry me , the night I put the crib together , I meant it . Even though I knew you were n't ready . God , I hope you 're ready now . Marry me , Ella . Because no matter where you go or what you do , I 'll love you every day for the rest of my life . — JackI felt no fear , reading those words . Only wonder , that so much happiness could be within my reach . Noticing something else in the cup , I reached in and pulled out a diamond ring , the stone round and glittering . My breath caught as I turned it in the light . I tried on the ring , and it slid neatly onto my finger . Picking up a nearby pen , I turned over the paper and wrote my answer in a flourishing scrawl . I poured my coffee , added cream and sweetener , and went back into the bedroom with the note . Jack was sitting on the edge of the bed , his head tilted slightly as he watched me . His simmering gaze took me in from head to toe , lingering at the diamond sparkling on my hand . I saw his chest rise and fall with a quick breath . Sipping my coffee , I approached him and handed him the note . Dear Jack , I love you , too . And I think I know the secret to a long and happy marriage — just choose someone you ca n't live without . For me , that would be you . So if you insist on being traditional . . .Yes.—EllaJack let out a pent - up sigh . He took my hips in his hands as I stood before him . "
113503	113513	113050	113050	Luke	117	" he murmured , drawing me between his thighs . "
113526	113549	113517	113517	you	2245	"Taking care not to spill my coffee , I leaned forward and pressed my lips against his , letting our tongues touch . "

113598	113641	113590	113590	you	0	" Taking the coffee from me , he finished it in a few swallows and set the cup aside , disregarding my laughing protest . He kissed me until my arms were twined around his neck and my knees threatened to buckle . "Ella
113643	113655	113517	113517	you	2245	" he said , finishing the kiss with a gentle nuzzle , "

114154	114427	114428	114428	My	0	" he said . As for Jack 's side of the family , I found them colorful , affectionate , argumentative , fascinating . They were a real family , and they made a place for me , and I loved them for it . I quickly grew fond of Churchill , who was a kind and generous soul despite the fact that he did n't suffer fools gladly . We debated various subjects and annoyed each other with dueling political e - mails , and we made each other laugh , and he insisted that I sit right next to him at family dinners . After two weeks at Garner Hospital , Joe came home to recuperate at the mansion in River Oaks , which delighted Churchill nearly as much as it aggravated his son . Joe said he wanted privacy . He did n't like it that when anyone came to see him , they visited with his dad first . But Churchill , who hardly minded having so many attractive young women come to the house , retorted that if Joe did n't like it , he 'd better get well faster . As a result Joe was a model patient , determined to recover his health as soon as possible and get away from his interfering parent . I married Jack two months after he proposed , which shocked all of my friends and most of his , who had come to think of him as a perennial bachelor . I 'd heard some speculation that his near - death experience had helped him to readjust his priorities . "

114449	114740	114428	114428	My	0	"The night before the wedding , my sister Tara came to the dinner for out - of - town guests . She was beautifully dressed in a pink suit , her hair upswept , diamond studs sparkling at her ears . And she was unescorted . I wanted to ask her how she was , if she was being treated well , if she was happy in her arrangement with Noah . But all thoughts of Tara 's relationship with Noah Cardiff disappeared as soon as I realized she had brought Luke . He was a gorgeous blue - eyed cherub who reached and grabbed for things , grinned , and drooled , and looked too adorable for words . I held out my arms eagerly , and Tara handed him to me . The cuddly weight of Luke on my chest , the scent and warmth of him , the round , searching eyes that tried to take everything in , all of it reminded me that I would never be quite whole without him . During the two months we had been apart , I had tried to console myself with the thought that in time the pain of Luke 's absence would fade , that I would forget and move on . But as I snuggled him close and smoothed his soft black hair , and he smiled as if he remembered me , I knew nothing had changed . Love did n't move on . I held Luke in my lap all during the formal dinner , once getting up to walk around with him , another time taking him upstairs to change his diaper , despite my sister 's protest that she could do it . "
114744	114771	114428	114428	My	0	" I told her , laughing as Luke grasped the strand of pearls I was wearing and attempted to cram some of them into his mouth . "

I paused as I saw Jack and Tara ascending to the top of the flight , both of them absorbed in conversation . Jack glanced at me and smiled faintly , but his eyes were alert , and intent , and it seemed there was something he wanted to tell me . And Tara looked guarded . What in the world could they have been talking about?"Hey

115072	115111	115069	115069	her	2262	what?"But he did n't answer . He pried the baby away from me , laid him against his shoulder , and patted his diapered bottom . Luke conformed to him bonelessly , content in Jack 's secure grip . "This

I looked up and saw Jack coming back with Luke . His gaze read every detail of my face as if it were a familiar and beloved landscape . He saw everything . A smile crept into the corners of his mouth , and he whispered something in the baby 's miniature ear . "She
