4228	4233	4212	4212	she	419	“ That’s … great . ”
4417	4420	4421	4421	I	0	“ So . ”

5105	5115	5116	5116	he	512	“ I would introduce myself by my net worth , ”
5119	5139	5116	5116	he	512	“ But it would be impolite to categorize you as a stranger given the purpose of tonight ’s dinner . ”
5184	5192	5193	5193	My	0	“ That ’s very considerate of you . ”
5200	5239	5193	5193	My	0	“ Do n’t worry , Mr. Russo . If I wanted to know your net worth , I could Google it . I ’m sure the information is as readily available as the tales of your legendary charm . ”

5462	5489	5459	5459	Francis	154	“ That ’s enough time to plan a proper celebration without dragging things out too long . However , public announcements should go out right away . ”
5648	5655	5656	5656	I	0	“ No , it wo n’t . ”
5678	5696	5673	5673	I	0	“ No one will believe I ’m marrying someone with such short notice unless something was wrong . ”
5767	5774	5762	5762	Francis	154	“ Then what would you suggest ? ”
5775	5784	5731	5731	Restraint	164	“ A year is a more reasonable timeframe . ”
5828	5836	5837	5837	I	0	“ Announcements should also go out later , ”
5840	5869	5837	5837	I	0	“ A month gives us time to craft a proper story , considering your daughter and I have never so much as been seen in public together before . ”
5870	5884	5885	5885	he	154	“ We do n’t need a month to come up with a story , ”
5928	5932	5933	5933	he	154	“ Two weeks , ”
5936	5948	5933	5933	he	154	“ We ’ll announce the weekend Vivian moves into your house . ”
6004	6024	6025	6025	Francis	154	“ I ’m sure your family would like the announcements to go out sooner rather than later as well , ”
6037	6043	6025	6025	Francis	154	“ Do n’t you agree ? ”
6055	6061	6044	6044	I	0	“ Two weeks it is . ”

6266	6272	6262	6262	she	258	“ How was your flight ? ”
6273	6276	6262	6262	she	258	“ Fine . ”
6277	6303	6304	6304	I	0	“ I appreciate you taking the time to fly in when we could ’ve met in New York . I know you must be busy . ”
6331	6354	6355	6355	Her	258	“ I also heard the more zeroes one has in their bank account , the fewer words they ’re capable of speaking . ”
6365	6373	6355	6355	Her	258	“ You ’re proving the rumor correct . ”
6374	6393	6449	6449	her	258	“ I thought a society heiress like yourself would know better than to discuss money in polite company . ”
6394	6400	6449	6449	her	258	“ The keyword is polite . ”
6517	6530	6531	6531	I	0	“ It ’s not polite to speak to a guest that way , ”
6552	6559	6548	6548	she	258	“ What would your parents say ? ”
6600	6626	6596	6596	Her	258	“ They ’d say guests should adhere to social niceties as much as the host , including making an effort to hold a polite conversation . ”
6627	6647	6648	6648	I	0	“ Yeah ? Do social niceties include dressing like you stepped out of a Fifth Avenue Stepford Wives factory ? ”
6701	6717	6718	6718	Vivian	258	“ No , but they certainly do n’t include ruining a nice dinner with discourtesy , ”
6722	6759	6718	6718	Vivian	258	“ You should buy a nice set of manners to match your suit , Mr. Russo . As a luxury goods CEO , you know better than anyone how one ugly accessory can ruin an outfit . ”
6796	6827	6791	6791	herself	553	“ Dante , is it true all Russos get married at the family estate in Lake Como ? I hear renovations will be finished by next summer before the wedding . ”
6851	6854	6855	6855	I	0	“ Yes , ”
6862	6877	6855	6855	I	0	“ All Russo weddings have taken place at Villa Serafina since the eighteenth century . ”
7006	7009	7010	7010	Cecelia	166	“ Wonderful ! ”
7013	7053	7010	7010	Cecelia	166	“ Oh , I ’m so thrilled you ’ll be part of the family soon . You and Vivian are a perfect match . You know , she speaks six languages , plays the piano and violin , and — ”
7054	7058	7059	7059	I	0	“ Excuse me . ”
7084	7088	7059	7059	I	0	“ Nature calls . ”
7545	7551	7555	7555	my	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
7593	7599	7600	7600	I	0	“ Enjoying a smoke break . ”
7629	7636	7622	7622	Francis	154	“ In my father ’s office ? ”
7637	7640	7644	7644	my	0	“ Obviously . ”
7714	7747	7709	7709	her	258	“ I understand you ’re probably used to doing whatever you want , but it ’s exceedingly rude to sneak off during a dinner party and smoke in your host ’s office . ”
7754	7769	7709	7709	her	258	“ Please rejoin us in the dining room . Your food is getting cold . ”
7770	7779	7780	7780	I	0	“ That ’s my problem , not yours . ”
7784	7812	7780	7780	I	0	“ Why do n’t you join me for a break ? I promise it ’ll be more enjoyable than your mother ’s hand wringing over floral arrangements . ”
7813	7825	7826	7826	she	258	“ Based on our interactions so far , I doubt it , ”
7850	7860	7861	7861	Vivian	258	“ I do n’t understand why you ’re here , ”
7897	7898	7900	7900	I	0	” “
7902	7906	7900	7900	I	0	” I drawled . “
7913	7921	7922	7922	You	0	” Her fingers curled into loose fists . “
7926	7927	7922	7922	You	0	” “
7935	8097	7928	7928	You	0	” I rose and circled the desk until I stood close enough to see the pulse fluttering in her neck . How much faster would it beat if I wrapped her hair around my fist and pulled her head back ? If I kissed her until her mouth bruised and hiked up her skirt until she begged me to fuck her ? Heat ran to my groin . I was n’t interested in actually fucking her , but she was so prim and proper she begged for corruption . The silence was deafening as I lifted my hand and grazed my thumb over her bottom lip . Vivian ’s breathing shallowed , but she did n’t move away . She stared at me , eyes full of defiance as I took my time exploring the lush curve of her mouth . It was full , soft , and disturbingly tempting compared to the stiff formality of the rest of her appearance . “
8104	8109	8100	8102	a beautiful woman	597	” I said lazily . “
8131	8132	8121	8121	I	0	” “
8142	8150	8135	8135	I	0	” Her breath drifted over my skin . “
8162	8243	8244	8244	You	0	” The reminder of the deal killed the sensuality of the moment as quickly as it came . My thumb paused on the center of her bottom lip before I dropped my hand with a silent curse . My skin tingled with heat from the memory of her softness . I hated Francis for the blackmail , but I loathed Vivian for being his pawn . So what the fuck was I doing , toying with her in his office ? “
8253	8272	8244	8244	You	0	” My smile cut across my face , cruel and devoid of humor as I regathered my composure . “
8306	8310	8304	8304	you	0	” I shrugged . “
8319	8389	8304	8304	you	0	” Vivian did n’t know about her father ’s manipulation . Francis had warned me not to tell her , not that I would ’ve , anyway . The fewer people who knew about the blackmail , the better . He ’d uncovered one of my few weak spots , and I ’d be damned if I broadcast it to the world . Vivian ’s eyes glowed with anger . “
8395	8396	8392	8393	an asshole	601	” “
8427	8436	8437	8437	I	0	” I straightened my jacket with deliberate care . “
8455	8513	8445	8445	you	169	” I brushed past her , reveling in the delicious taste of her indignation . One day , she ’d get her unspoken wish and wake up to a broken engagement . Until then , I ’d bide my time and play along because Francis ’s ultimatum had been clear . Marry Vivian , or my brother dies .
8626	8632	8633	8633	Luca	170	“ What ’s the emergency ? ”
8644	8659	8633	8633	Luca	170	“ I just got off the plane . Give a guy time to sleep . ”
8660	8676	8679	8679	he	170	“ According to the society pages , you have n’t slept for the past month . ”
8715	8718	8719	8719	He	170	“ Exactly . ”
8723	8731	8719	8719	He	170	“ That ’s why I need sleep . ”
8787	8798	8799	8799	Luca	170	“ Are n’t you curious why I called you here ? ”
8811	8818	8799	8799	Luca	170	“ You missed your baby bro ? ”
8819	8823	8824	8824	I	0	“ Not quite . ”
8841	8845	8824	8824	I	0	“ Open it . ”
8913	8925	8926	8926	I	0	“ Do you know who the woman in those photos is ? ”
8938	8942	8929	8929	Luca	170	“ Maria Romano . ”
8954	9003	8943	8943	I	0	“ Niece of mafia don Gabriele Romano . Twenty - seven years old , widowed , and the apple of her uncle ’s eye . The name should ring a bell , considering you were fucking her before you left for Europe , as evidenced by these photos . ”
9010	9015	8943	8943	I	0	“ How did you — ”
9016	9058	9004	9004	My	0	“ That ’s not the right question , Luca . The right question is what kind of casket you ’d like at your funeral because that ’s what I ’ll have to fucking plan if Romano ever finds out about this ! ”
9103	9114	9115	9115	I	0	“ A mafia princess ? Are you fucking kidding me ? ”
9155	9174	9175	9175	I	0	“ You ’ve done some stupid shit in your life , but this has to take the cake , ”

20652	20679	20649	20649	I	0	“ Do we eat dinner together every night ? Discuss our work problems ? Go grocery shopping and argue over which brand of wine to buy ? ”

20963	20996	20958	20958	I	0	“ You avoided my question the first time , but I ’m asking again . What could you possibly get out of our match that you could n’t get on your own ? ”
21067	21073	21063	21063	His	417	“ It does n’t matter . ”
21074	21089	21063	21063	His	417	“ Considering it ’s the reason we ’re together , I think it does . ”
21090	21108	21109	21109	His	417	“ No , it does n’t . Why do you care about the reason we ’re together ? ”
21116	21159	21109	21109	His	417	“ You ’ll marry me either way . The dutiful daughter who does everything her daddy says . I could be gone for the next year until our wedding , and you ’d still go through with it . Would n’t you ? ”
21214	21219	21220	21220	I	0	“ Now I understand . ”
21233	21255	21256	21256	I	0	“ An arranged marriage is the only way you could get someone to marry you . You are so … so … ”
21264	21267	21256	21256	I	0	“ Horrible . ”
21285	21301	21302	21302	He	927	“ If I ’m so horrible , then tell your family the wedding ’s off . ”
21308	21327	21302	21302	He	927	“ Call them right now . We ’ll move you back into your apartment like this never happened . ”
21461	21464	21465	21465	he	927	“ Exactly , ”
21735	21742	21743	21743	Winona	200	“ Dante , relax your expression , ”

21815	21828	21798	21798	Winona	200	“ Vivian , put your arms around his neck and move closer . ”
21842	21856	21857	21857	Winona	200	“ Closer . I can practically drive a tractor between you right now , ”
21860	21873	21874	21874	I	0	“ Do as she says so we can get this over with , ”
21890	21898	21899	21899	Vivian	258	“ You grow more charming every day . ”
21913	21922	21899	21899	Vivian	258	“ Europe truly did wonders for your personality . ”
21923	21926	21927	21927	Winona	200	“ Closer , ”
21944	21949	21938	21938	she	200	“ One more step … ”

22045	22060	22061	22061	I	0	“ I received an interesting call from my accountant when I was in Paris , ”
22074	22097	22061	22061	I	0	“ One hundred thousand dollars charged to my Amex in one day , including ten grand on flowers . Care to explain ? ”
22098	22110	22111	22111	Vivian	258	“ You gave me a black Amex , I used it , ”
22118	22131	22111	22111	Vivian	258	“ What can I say ? I like flowers . And shoes . ”
22180	22183	22184	22184	I	0	“ Clearly , ”
22202	22207	22194	22194	her	258	“ And the towels ? ”
22208	22217	22194	22194	her	258	“ They were a gift from my mother . ”
22223	22238	22239	22239	she	258	“ Let me know in advance the next time you leave for a month , ”
22242	22278	22239	22239	she	258	“ I want time to plan a party , redecorate the living room , maybe come up with a robust shopping list . It ’s amazing how much you can do with no spending limit . ”
22396	22410	22429	22429	her	258	“ You had a good time while I was gone , did you ? ”
22419	22426	22429	22429	her	258	“ I had a wonderful time . ”
22444	22458	22441	22441	She	258	“ The house has been so pleasant without all the scowls and grunts . ”
22459	22468	22469	22469	I	0	“ Here I thought you ’d miss me . ”
22472	22477	22469	22469	I	0	“ I ’m hurt . ”
22478	22504	22429	22429	her	258	“ I would apologize , but catering to your feelings is n’t part of our arrangement . It ’s just a business deal . Remember ? ”
22514	22523	22512	22512	Touché	202	“ Look at you two . So sweet . ”
22527	22554	22524	22524	Winona	200	“ Dante , why do n’t you give her a kiss on the lips ? It ’ll be the perfect photo to wrap up the shoot . ”
22566	22572	22573	22573	she	258	“ That ’s not necessary , ”
22577	22587	22573	22573	she	258	“ We don’t … we do n’t like PDA . ”
22588	22597	22598	22598	Winona	200	“ There ’s no one here except us , ”
22631	22636	22637	22637	Vivian	258	“ Yes , but … ”
22686	22701	22702	22702	Vivian	258	“ We really do n’t feel comfortable kissing in front of any third party , ”
22750	22773	22743	22743	she	258	“ If you do n’t want to , that ’s fine , but it ’s not an engagement shoot without a kiss . ”
22781	22790	22743	22743	she	258	“ I promise I wo n’t be scandalized . ”
22791	22794	22795	22795	Vivian	258	“ Right . ”
23058	23064	23065	23065	Winona	200	“ We got the shot ! ”
23180	23195	23196	23196	She	200	“ You two might be the most photogenic couple I ’ve ever worked with . ”
23199	23212	23196	23196	She	200	“ I ca n’t wait for you to see the final photos . ”
23213	23217	23218	23218	Vivian	258	“ Thank you , ”
23225	23234	23221	23221	her	258	“ I ’m sure they ’ll be great . ”
23235	23240	23241	23241	I	0	“ Are we done ? ”
23277	23293	23294	23294	Winona	200	“ Yes , I ’ll email you a link to the gallery in two weeks , ”
23303	23310	23294	23294	Winona	200	“ Congratulations again on your engagement . ”
23481	23488	23467	23467	Vivian	258	“ About the kiss back there — ”
23489	23496	23497	23497	I	0	“ It was for the photo . ”
23504	23510	23497	23497	I	0	“ I know , but — ”
23511	23516	23517	23517	I	0	“ Are you hungry ? ”
23548	23555	23556	23556	she	258	“ I could use some food , ”
23573	23579	23559	23559	Her	258	“ What are you doing ? ”
23580	23584	23585	23585	I	0	“ Buying breakfast . ”
23595	23610	23585	23585	I	0	“ Two coffees and signature bagels . Keep the change . Thanks , Omar . ”
23682	23685	23664	23664	her	258	“ What ? ”
23686	23699	23664	23664	her	258	“ You ’re on a first - name basis with the owner . ”
23700	23703	23704	23704	I	0	“ Obviously . ”
23713	23742	23704	23704	I	0	“ I run here in the mornings when I have time , and I ’ve tried all the breakfast carts around the park . Omar ’s the best . ”
23743	23755	23664	23664	her	258	“ Here I thought you only ate caviar and human hearts . ”
23756	23769	23770	23770	Vivian	258	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . Caviar tastes awful with human hearts . ”
23803	23826	23786	23786	I	0	“ I pay for quality , not price . Expensive does n’t always equal good , especially when it comes to food . ”
23827	23834	23835	23835	She	258	“ For once , we agree . ”
23852	23861	23835	23835	She	258	“ We should check the temperature in hell . ”
23878	23897	23898	23898	Vivian	258	“ One of my favorite restaurants before it closed was this tiny little place in Boston ’s Chinatown , ”
23923	23965	23903	23903	she	258	“ If you were n’t looking for it , you ’d miss it . The decor looked like something out of the early nineties and the floors were suspiciously sticky , but they had the best dumplings I ’d ever tasted . ”
23973	23979	23903	23903	she	258	“ Why did it close ? ”
23980	24010	24015	24015	her	258	“ The owner died , and his son did n’t want to take it over . He sold it to someone who turned it into an electronics repair shop . ”
24018	24069	24015	24015	her	258	“ My family and I ate there every week , but I guess we would ’ve stopped going even if it ’d stayed open . They only go to Michelin - starred places now . If they saw me eating from a food truck , they ’d have a coronary . ”
24111	24129	24130	24130	I	0	“ My brother and I used to go to this place in midtown when we were kids , ”
24133	24208	24130	24130	I	0	“ Moondust Diner . The neighborhood was a tourist trap , but the diner had the best milkshakes in the city . Two dollars , glasses almost as big as our heads . We went there every week after school until our grandfather found out . He was furious . Said Russos do n’t frequent cheap diners and assigned someone to walk us home straight after school . We never went back after that . ”
24242	24257	24258	24258	Vivian	258	“ Two - dollar milkshakes ? I would ’ve been a dentist ’s nightmare , ”
24261	24270	24258	24258	Vivian	258	“ Mine was n’t my biggest fan either . ”
24313	24329	24310	24310	I	0	“ Things must have changed quite a bit after your father ’s business took off . ”
24373	24379	24380	24380	Vivian	258	“ That ’s an understatement . ”
24392	24472	24380	24380	Vivian	258	“ When I was fourteen , my mother sat me down for the talk . It was n’t about sex ; it was about expectations for who I should and could date . I was free to be with anyone I wanted as long as they met certain criteria . That was also the day I found out I was expected to have an arranged marriage if I did n’t find anyone ‘ suitable ’ within a certain time . ”
24510	24523	24503	24503	they	986	“ I take it your parents were n’t fans of your exes . ”
24536	24539	24530	24530	I	0	“ No . ”
24547	24559	24530	24530	I	0	“ What about you ? Any exes you thought about marrying ? ”
24560	24568	24503	24503	they	986	“ I was n’t interested in marriage . ”
24569	24577	24578	24578	I	0	“ Hmm . I ’m not surprised . ”
24585	24588	24578	24578	I	0	“ Meaning ? ”
24589	24632	24503	24503	they	986	“ Meaning you ’re a control freak . You probably hated — and still hate — the idea of someone coming in and upending your life . The more people in the household , the harder it is to control your surroundings . ”
24655	24668	24669	24669	she	258	“ It ’s pretty obvious in the way you run your household , ”
24672	24737	24669	24669	she	258	“ Plus , during meals , you ’re anal about your foods not touching . You put the meat on the upper left side of your plate , vegetables on the upper right , and carbs and grains on the bottom . You did it at my parents ’ house and on my first night at your place , before you left for Europe . ”
24755	24759	24760	24760	she	258	“ Control freak , ”
24769	24772	24760	24760	she	258	“ Impressive . ”
24806	24813	24814	24814	Vivian	258	“ It comes with the job , ”
24817	24839	24814	24814	Vivian	258	“ Event planning requires strong attention to detail , especially when you ’re dealing with the types of clients I have . ”
24861	24871	24846	24846	She	258	“ Why event planning instead of the family business ? ”
24880	24901	24902	24902	she	258	“ I like jewelry as a consumer , but I have no interest in the corporate side of the business , ”
24905	24983	24902	24902	she	258	“ Running Lau Jewels would n’t be a creative endeavor . It would be about stockholders , financial reports , and a thousand other things I do n’t care about . I hate numbers , and I ’m not good at them . My sister Agnes is the one who likes that stuff . She ’s the company ’s head of sales and marketing , and when my father retires , she ’ll take over as CEO . ”
25047	25061	25062	25062	Vivian	258	“ What about you ? Did you ever want to do something else ? ”
25065	25068	25062	25062	Vivian	258	“ No . ”
25094	25117	25118	25118	I	0	“ My father refused to take over the company , so it was up to me to carry on the Russo tradition , ”
25121	25128	25118	25118	I	0	“ Abnegating was never an option . ”
25129	25141	25062	25062	Vivian	258	“ Your father could but you could n’t ? Seems unfair . ”
25142	25216	25118	25118	I	0	“ There ’s no such thing as fairness in the business world . Besides , my father would ’ve been shit as CEO . He ’s the type of guy who cares more about being liked than getting the job done . He would ’ve run the company into the ground within years , and my grandfather knew it . That was why he did n’t push him into taking an executive role . ”
25341	25354	25355	25355	I	0	“ Speaking of my parents , they ’d like to meet you , ”
25396	25404	25407	25407	Christian	167	“ We ’re spending Thanksgiving with them . ”
25442	25445	25446	25446	She	258	“ Okay . ”
25465	25474	25462	25462	she	258	“ Do your parents live in New York ? ”
25475	25480	25481	25481	I	0	“ A little farther . ”
25493	25496	25481	25481	I	0	“ Bali . ”
25521	25536	25516	25516	Vivian	258	“ You want us to fly to Bali to meet your parents for Thanksgiving ? ”
25537	25558	25566	25566	she	258	“ We ’ll be there for a week . We leave the Sunday prior and come back the following Monday . ”

25740	25782	25839	25839	Vivian	258	“ That ’s not the point . We should be consulting each other on this type of stuff . You ’re my fiancé , not my boss . You ca n’t just tell me to jump and expect me to jump . ”
25789	25811	25812	25812	I	0	“ Considering I ’m the one who paid for your shoes and flowers , I think I can do exactly that . ”

26928	26977	26978	26978	She	178	“ It ’s amazing . Higher pay , better benefits , and fewer hours than anything else I ’d find in the city . It beats bartending with Creepy Colin breathing all over me by a mile . Maybe I ’ll actually have time to finish my book … ”

28097	28155	28094	28094	his	192	“ I knew you ’d never willingly choose someone like Dante . I looked him up after your text . All those rumors about him and what he ’s like … no amount of money in the world is worth it . What the hell were your parents thinking ? Besides the fact he ’s a billionaire . ”

29160	29182	29183	29183	He	167	“ No . You simply slash the rent for everyone who wants to live in your building for no good reason . ”

30878	30905	30906	30906	He	154	“ I ’m sure I will with your support . We ’re practically family now , and family helps each other out . Do n’t they ? ”

33616	33636	33610	33610	he	1147	“ You make fun of me for my food choices but you ’re pouring soy sauce over ice cream ? ”
33678	33695	33696	33696	Dante	258	“ Drizzling , not pouring . And do n’t knock it till you ’ve tried it , ”
33707	33720	33721	33721	His	1147	“ I bet it tastes better than the abomination you put together . ”

34086	34106	34077	34077	I	0	“ I ’ve already eaten from it . It’s … unhygienic to share food . Get your own bowl . ”
34118	34129	34112	34112	I	0	“ Fine . It tastes good . Are you happy ? ”
34140	34163	34130	34130	I	0	“ I ’m not the only one who was wrong . You ’ve finished half the chips in the past five minutes . ”
34164	34170	34171	34171	He	1156	“ That ’s an exaggeration . ”
34182	34193	34171	34171	He	1156	“ But this is n’t as terrible as I thought . ”

34301	34383	34298	34298	he	1156	“ Luca and I hung out in the kitchen a lot as kids . We had a game room , pool , all the latest toys … pretty much everything anyone under the age of twelve could want . But sometimes , we wanted company other than each other , and the chef was one of the few people in the household who treated us like actual people . He let us play around in there when he was n’t cooking . ”
34387	34395	34384	34384	Dante	258	“ We were kids . We experimented . ”

34686	34798	34673	34673	Dante	258	“ He interned at the company in college . It was a disaster , so our grandfather allowed him to ‘ pursue his passions ’ instead of taking on a corporate role . He already had me as an heir ; he did n’t need Luca . But giving my brother too much freedom was a mistake . Luca bounced around from job to job for a decade . He was a DJ one day , an actor the next . He sank half his trust fund into a nightclub that folded within eight months of opening . He needs stability and structure , not more time and money to burn . ”
34817	34825	34826	34826	I	0	“ So you gave him a job , ”
34829	34836	34826	34826	I	0	“ What does he do now ? ”

34857	34931	34850	34850	I	0	“ He does n’t get special treatment because he ’s my brother . When I started at the Russo Group , I worked as a stock clerk . It was one of the greatest lessons my grandfather taught me . In order to lead a company , you have to know the company . Every facet , every position , every detail . Leaders who are out of touch are leaders who fail . ”
35000	35011	35012	35012	I	0	“ I get the sense Luca does n’t like me , ”
35015	35035	35012	35012	I	0	“ Every time I tried to talk to him at the party , he made an excuse and left . ”
35055	35071	35072	35072	He	1175	“ Do n’t take it personally . He gets moody at those types of things . ”
35077	35095	35072	35072	He	1175	“ Speaking of the party , you never told me who ’s on your dream husband list . ”

35562	35583	35584	35584	Her	178	“ What ? It ’s true . You deserve some fun after working your butt off these past few weeks . ”
35597	35629	35594	35594	her	178	“ Speaking of fun , what do you think my character ’s signature murder method should be ? Poison , strangulation , or good ol’ hacking with a butcher ’s knife ? ”
35630	35633	35594	35594	her	178	“ Poison . ”
35650	35664	35665	35665	I	0	“ Hacking it is . Thanks , Viv . You ’re the best . ”

35775	35820	35821	35821	she	178	“ Back to the topic at hand . You need to take the sex for a test drive before you commit . You do n’t want to be stuck with someone bad in bed . Not that I think Dante would have that problem , ”
35824	35831	35821	35821	she	178	“ I bet he fucks like — ”
35832	35835	35836	35836	I	0	“ Stop . ”

50359	50391	50351	50351	she	258	“ It ’s perfect timing , because I was going to grab a snack . My call with the Legacy Ball committee ran over , and I forgot to eat lunch . ”

Started a whole international incident because the guest was the son of a UN ambassador . Though to be fair , you ’d expect the son of a UN ambassador to know which fork is used for salads and which is used for entrées . Is n’t that right ? ”
51459	51470	51446	51446	Vivian	258	“ Now , let me take a look at you . ”
51484	51525	51477	51477	her	419	“ Oh , you ’re beautiful . Is n’t she beautiful , Dante ? Tell me , darling , what do you use for your skin ? It ’s positively glowing . Argan oil ? Snail mucin ? La Mer … ”

The backyard boasted an infinity pool and open - air yoga studio , and the four bedrooms were split half and half between the ground floor , where my parents stayed , and the upper floor . “
52007	52018	51916	51918	a management consultant	1529	” My mother flung open the door with a flourish . “
52027	52045	52046	52046	Mother	257	” Vivian ’s mouth parted in shock while a migraine bloomed at the base of my skull . “

52089	52212	52076	52076	I	0	” The migraine spread up my neck and behind my eyes with alarming speed . My mother ’s idea of romantic was my idea of a nightmare . Red rose petals blanketed the floor . A bucket of chilled champagne sat on the nightstand next to two crystal flutes while a box of chocolates , condoms , and towels folded into the shape of swans rested at the base of the canopy bed . A fucking couple portrait of me and Vivian hung on the wall opposite the bed beneath a glittery banner that read , Congratulations on your engagement ! It looked like a goddamn honeymoon suite , except it was infinitely more horrifying because my own mother set it up . “
52222	52226	52217	52217	you	0	” I demanded . “

52387	52523	52384	52384	me	0	” She winked at us before darting out the door . My father followed , too busy on his phone to pay attention to what was happening . Silence descended , thick and heavy . Vivian ’s smile disappeared after my mother left . We stared at the portrait , then at each other , then at the bed . It suddenly hit me that this would be our first time sharing a room . Sharing a bed . Six days and five nights of sleeping next to her . Of seeing her in those ridiculously tiny outfits she called pajamas and listening to the water run while she bathed . Six days and five nights of fucking torture . I rubbed a hand over my face . It was going to be a long week .
52581	52596	52561	52561	they	1536	“ I want to know everything . How you met , how he proposed . ”

52791	52798	52799	52799	I	0	“ It happened in Central Park , ”
52803	52821	52799	52799	I	0	“ It was a gorgeous morning , and I thought we were simply going for a walk … ”

52919	52928	52908	52908	Gianni	260	“ Dante , non manchi mai di sorprendermi . ”

52947	52972	52973	52973	Janis	219	“ What a unique proposal ! I can see why you went to the trouble to get the ring back . It ’s stunning . ”
52997	53011	53012	53012	Dante	258	“ Dante ’s always had a good eye , though I ’d expected … ”
53024	53037	53017	53017	her	1547	“ Anyway , like I said , it ’s a beautiful ring . ”

53502	53551	53495	53495	Dante	258	“ My parents took off around the world soon after Luca was born . They could n’t bring two children on their travels , given how much they moved around , so they left us in our grandfather ’s care . They said it was for the best . ”
53552	53558	53495	53495	Dante	258	“ Did they visit often ? ”
53559	53575	53576	53576	He	1565	“ Once a year at most . They sent postcards on Christmas and our birthdays . ”
53585	53599	53576	53576	He	1565	“ Luca kept his in a special box . I threw mine out . ”
53600	53605	53606	53606	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
53613	53622	53606	53606	I	0	“ You must ’ve missed them very much . ”

53704	53780	53695	53695	We	1572	“ Do n’t be fooled by their hospitality , Vivian . They fuss over me whenever they see me because they do n’t see me often , and it makes them feel like they ’re doing their job as parents . They ’ll take us out to eat , buy us nice things and ask about our lives , but if you ask them to stick around during the hard times , they ’re gone . ”
53781	53794	53695	53695	We	1572	“ What about your brother ? What ’s his relationship with them ? ”
53795	53838	53695	53695	We	1572	“ Luca was an accident . I was planned because they needed an heir . My grandfather demanded it . But when my brother came along … taking care of two children was too much for my parents , and they bailed . ”
53839	53847	53695	53695	We	1572	“ So your grandfather took over instead . ”
53848	53853	53695	53695	We	1572	“ He was thrilled . ”
53860	53884	53886	53886	he	1575	“ My father disappointed him on the business front , but he could mold me into his perfect successor from a young age . ”
53918	53940	53941	53941	I	0	“ Let me guess . He took you to boardroom play dates and gave you cartoon explainers on the stock market ? ”
54008	54082	54005	54005	his	1576	“ Close . My grandfather ran his household the way he ran his business . He was the first , last , and only word on any subject . Everything operated by a strict set of rules , from our playtime hours to what hobbies Luca and I were allowed to pursue . I was seven when I took my first factory tour , ten when I started learning about contracts and negotiations . ”

Look at Tim and Arabella Creighton . They were once superstars in Manhattan society . Now Tim ’s facing trial , and no one will touch Arabella with a ten - foot pole . All her supposed friends dropped her . ”

The only languages they understand are money , power , and strength . Those that have it will do anything to keep it . Those who do n’t will do anything to get it . ”

54535	54565	54527	54527	I	0	“ I want to learn more about this diving your father was talking about . I ’ve never been to Bali before . What else is there to do ? ”

54623	54655	54656	54656	I	0	“ To be fair , the island is one of the top diving destinations in the world . There are also some beautiful temples and a great art scene in Ubud … ”

55078	55088	55073	55073	Janis	219	“ It ’s rude to text at the table . ”
55089	55092	55093	55093	He	1592	“ Sorry . ”
55169	55175	55176	55176	Dante	258	“ Put your phone down . ”

55962	55971	55972	55972	Janis	219	“ Of course they ’re getting along great , ”
55975	55992	55972	55972	Janis	219	“ They ’re in love ! Honestly , Luca , what a silly thing to say . ”
56004	56011	56012	56012	Luca	170	“ You ’re right . Sorry , ”
56019	56034	56012	56012	Luca	170	“ Just never thought I ’d see the day when Dante fell in love . ”
56035	56038	56039	56039	Dante	258	“ Enough . ”
56045	56056	56039	56039	Dante	258	“ This is n’t a roundtable on my love life . ”
56103	56113	56114	56114	she	1618	“ I like the way Dante is around you , ”
56117	56122	56114	56114	she	1618	“ He ’s less … ”
56123	56126	56096	56096	Janis	219	“ Uptight ? ”
56157	56160	56161	56161	Janis	219	“ Yes . ”
56164	56229	56161	56161	Janis	219	“ He likes things done a certain way , and he ’s not afraid to tell you if they do n’t meet his standards . When he was a toddler , we tried feeding him broccoli with a bit of mashed potatoes on it . He threw the plate on the floor . Three - hundred - dollar Wedgwood . Can you believe it ? ”
56275	56286	56287	56287	Her	1618	“ Was it hard saying goodbye to him and Luca ? ”
56295	56307	56287	56287	Her	1618	“ I see he ’s been talking to you about us . ”
56318	56323	56287	56287	Her	1618	“ Not that much . ”
56345	56380	56381	56381	she	1618	“ It ’s okay , darling . I know he ’s not my biggest fan . Truth be told , I ’m not a great mother , and Gianni is not a great father , ”
56389	56414	56381	56381	she	1618	“ It ’s why we left the boys in their grandfather ’s care . He gave them the stability and discipline we could n’t . ”
56424	56459	56460	56460	She	1618	“ We tried . Gianni and I quit traveling and settled in Italy after I found out I was pregnant with Dante . We stayed there for six years until after Luca was born . ”
56474	56555	56556	56556	She	1618	“ It sounds bad , but those six years made me realize I was n’t cut out for domestic life . I hated staying in one place , and I could n’t do anything right when it came to the boys . Gianni felt the same way , so we came to an agreement with Dante ’s grandfather . He became their legal guardian and moved them to New York . Gianni and I sold our farmhouse and … well . ”
56633	56642	56643	56643	Janis	219	“ You must think we ’re terribly selfish , ”
56646	56685	56643	56643	Janis	219	“ Perhaps we are . There have been many times when I wished I was the kind of mother they needed , but I ’m not . Pretending otherwise would ’ve hurt the boys more than it helped . ”
56686	56696	56697	56697	I	0	“ Maybe , but they ’re both adults now , ”
56701	56724	56697	56697	I	0	“ I think they would like to see their parents more often , even if it ’s only for milestones like birthdays . ”
56729	56736	56737	56737	She	1628	“ Luca , maybe . Dante … ”
56742	56778	56739	56739	her	1628	“ We had to twist his arm to get him to Bali . If it were n’t for you , he would ’ve brushed us off with another excuse about being too busy with work . ”
56798	56807	56808	56808	Janis	219	“ I ’m glad he has you now . ”
56820	56846	56808	56808	Janis	219	“ He could use a partner . He takes too much care of other people , and he does n’t take enough care of himself . ”
56918	56933	56934	56934	Janis	219	“ I ’ll be honest , I was skeptical about the engagement at first . ”
56952	56971	56934	56934	Janis	219	“ Knowing Dante , I would n’t put it past him to marry someone strictly for business purposes . ”
56980	56988	56989	56989	I	0	“ Our families work in similar fields , ”
56992	57002	56989	56989	I	0	“ So there is a business element to it . ”
57003	57017	57018	57018	She	1636	“ Yes , but I ’ve seen the way he looks at you . ”
57028	57035	57036	57036	She	1636	“ It ’s not about business . ”
57052	57060	57061	57061	Janis	219	“ How does he look at me ? ”
57064	57073	57061	57061	Janis	219	“ Like he never wants to look away . ”
57077	57086	57087	57087	Christian	167	“ A Thanksgiving Day call from Dante Russo . ”
57095	57100	57087	57087	Christian	167	“ I ’m honored . ”
57101	57117	57118	57118	I	0	“ You ’re the one who emailed me first on a federal holiday , Harper . ”
57178	57183	57184	57184	Christian	167	“ Ah , yes . ”
57197	57220	57191	57191	he	167	“ We found another set of photos in a safety deposit box registered to an alias . Total count is now five . ”
57227	57235	57236	57236	I	0	“ Do you think there ’s more ? ”
57291	57298	57299	57299	he	167	“ There could always be more , ”
57302	57321	57299	57299	he	167	“ That ’s the game we ’re playing until we can confirm exactly how many backups Francis has . ”
57358	57371	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ My team will continue looking until you tell us to stop . ”
57375	57402	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ I have to say , I ’m surprised you have n’t checked in since October . I thought the issue held more urgency for you . ”
57403	57409	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ I ’ve been busy . ”
57410	57413	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ Hmm . ”
57420	57451	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ Or perhaps you ’re warming up to your bride - to - be ? I heard you two disappeared for quite a while at Valhalla ’s New York gala . ”
57467	57481	57458	57458	everyone	527	“ What we do in our private time is none of your business . ”
57482	57500	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ Considering I ’m actively surveilling her father on your request , it ’s partly my business . ”
57507	57542	57372	57372	Christian	167	“ Be careful , Dante . You can either have Vivian or you can have her father ’s head on a platter — figuratively speaking , of course . You ca n’t have both . ”
57563	57572	57573	57573	I	0	“ I ’m well aware . Keep looking . ”
57670	57677	57678	57678	Vivian	258	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
57724	57728	57719	57719	My	0	“ Business associate . ”

57907	57913	57899	57899	her	258	“ What are you doing ? ”
57914	57920	57921	57921	I	0	“ Getting ready for bed . ”
57930	57952	57921	57921	I	0	“ I sleep hot , mia cara . You would n’t want me to roast to death overnight , would you ? ”
57953	57959	57960	57960	she	258	“ Do n’t be dramatic , ”
57971	57991	57960	57960	she	258	“ You ’re a grown man . One night of sleeping with your clothes on wo n’t kill you . ”
58212	58216	58217	58217	I	0	“ Stop it , ”
58221	58240	58217	58217	I	0	“ Neither of us will get any sleep if you insist on moving around like that all night . ”
58241	58252	58253	58253	She	258	“ I ca n’t help it . My brain is … ”
58259	58265	58253	58253	She	258	“ I ca n’t sleep . ”

58294	58318	58291	58291	she	258	“ I ca n’t believe I did n’t think of that . You should start a Dear Dante column in the local newspaper . ”
58319	58341	58342	58342	Vivian	258	“ Were you born with a smart mouth , or did your parents buy it for you after their first million ? ”
58349	58372	58342	58342	Vivian	258	“ If my parents had their way , I would n’t say anything except yes , of course , and I understand . ”
58381	58388	58342	58342	Vivian	258	“ Most parents want obedient children . ”
58400	58403	58418	58418	hers	258	“ Hmm . "
58477	58490	58491	58491	I	0	“ Are your parents upset we ’re not celebrating Thanksgiving with them ? ”
58494	58505	58491	58491	I	0	“ No . We ’re not big on the holiday . ”
58609	58624	58625	58625	We	1659	“ How much did your family change after your father ’s business took off ? ”
58685	58689	58690	58690	she	1663	“ A lot , ”
58693	58766	58690	58690	she	1663	“ One day , Agnes and I were attending public schools and eating school lunch . The next , we were at a fancy private academy with gourmet chefs and students showing up in chauffeured limos . Everything changed — our clothes , our house , our friends . Our family . At first , I loved it because what child would n’t love dressing up and having new toys ? But … ”
58774	58837	58767	58767	She	1663	“ The older I got , the more I realized how much money changed us . Not just materially , but spiritually , for lack of a better word . We were new money , but my parents were desperate to prove we were just as good as Boston ’s old - money elite . There ’s a difference , you know . ”
58856	58868	58869	58869	Vivian	258	“ The desire for validation consumed them , especially my father , ”
58872	58936	58869	58869	Vivian	258	“ I ca n’t pinpoint the exact turning point , but I woke up one morning and the funny , caring man who ’d carried me on his shoulders when I was a little girl and helped me build sandcastles on the beach was gone . In his place was someone who would do anything to reach the top of the social ladder . ”
58942	58948	58949	58949	she	258	“ I ’m not complaining , ”
58952	58972	58949	58949	she	258	“ I know how lucky I am to have been raised with the money we had . But sometimes … ”
58979	59002	58949	58949	she	258	“ I wonder if we would ’ve been happier had Lau Jewels stayed a tiny shop on a side street in Boston . ”
59029	59034	59035	59035	She	258	“ Sorry for rambling . ”
59039	59053	59035	59035	She	258	“ I did n’t mean to talk your ear off about my family . ”

60811	60822	60783	60783	his	265	“ It was one hit . Do n’t get cocky . ”
60823	60826	60827	60827	He	265	“ Three . ”
60838	60847	60827	60827	He	265	“ And that does n’t answer my question . ”

62499	62522	62495	62495	I	0	“ One kiss for each of my injuries . That ’s it . Would you deny a dying man his last wish ? ”
62532	62565	62566	62566	She	258	“ Do n’t be dramatic . You ’re the one who said you were , quote - unquote , fine . But since you insist on being such a baby about it … ”

63634	63673	63674	63674	she	178	“ I ’m drawing inspiration from real life . Perhaps I can write about an arranged marriage gone terribly wrong . The wife murders her husband after having a kinky affair with her sexy doorman … or not , ”
63683	63698	63674	63674	she	178	“ But you have to admit , sex and murder go hand in hand . ”

We may have kissed and … and gotten more intimate , but we are not a love match . You ’ve told me that time and again . You have me . But you do n’t get to dictate how I feel or who I think about . That is not part of the agreement . ”

66450	66502	66441	66441	She	185	“ He also has a big heart , even if he does n’t show it . He is not … good with words . His grandfather , may he rest in peace , was a good businessman but not a good communicator . He passed those traits down to the boys . ”

67659	67663	67664	67664	Christian	167	“ Of course . ”
67677	67737	67738	67738	Christian	167	“ You never answered my earlier question . Why do you care so much about this Heath ? It ca n’t possibly be because he ’s Vivian ’s ex - boyfriend . The man she was madly in love with until her parents made her break up with him because he did n’t come from Russo - level money . ”
67746	67760	67738	67738	Christian	167	“ Heard he sent her roses after New Year ’s . Nice ones . ”

67862	67893	67844	67844	Vivian	258	“ That ’s one reason . Another reason , one I ’m more inclined to believe , is that you ’re starting to develop feelings for your lovely future wife . ”

68092	68122	68089	68089	he	167	“ Do n’t worry , we ’re close . Soon , you ’ll be rid of their entire family , and you can have your house to yourself again . ”

68377	68409	68367	68367	he	167	“ Normally , I would n’t bother you with such a matter , but he was quite insistent on seeing Ms. Vivian . She agreed to let him in , but … ”
68414	68426	68367	68367	he	167	“ Given his unexpected arrival , I wanted to alert you . ”

70406	70411	70398	70398	Dante	258	“ He deserved it . ”
70419	70465	70398	70398	Dante	258	“ No , you ca n’t . Newsflash , having money does n’t absolve you from consequences . There ’s a … a proper way of doing things that does n’t include violence . You ’re lucky if he does n’t sue you for assault . ”
70466	70471	70472	70472	Dante	258	” I ’m lucky ? ”
70475	70499	70472	70472	Dante	258	“ He ’s lucky I did n’t break more than his nose for coming into my house and trying to wreck our engagement . ”
70500	70530	70531	70531	Dante	258	“ I ’m not saying he ’s right . I ’m saying there was a better way to handle the situation than opening yourself up to an assault charge ! ”
70563	70569	70570	70570	Dante	258	“ He was touching you . ”
70577	70586	70570	70570	Dante	258	“ Did you want him to touch you ? ”

70657	70673	70604	70604	I	0	“ I have n’t been ignoring you , and I did not run off to D.C. ”
70674	70709	70710	70710	Dante	258	“ You gave me the cold shoulder , avoided eye and verbal contact , and communicated in caveman grunts or via a third party at most . That ’s the textbook definition of ignoring . ”
70731	70770	70771	70771	I	0	“ You open up , then you shut down . You kiss me , then you leave . We ’ve been doing this back - and - forth dance for months , and I ’m sick of it . ”

70994	71002	70985	70985	Dante	258	“ What the fuck does that mean ? ”
71003	71041	71042	71042	My	0	“ It means exactly what it sounds like . We do what we want , discreetly , and we do n’t question the other about it as long as it does n’t affect our … public image . ”

71074	71098	71099	71099	He	1853	“ No , and that ’s not the point . Answer my question . Is this business , or is this something more ? ”
71103	71128	71099	71099	He	1853	“ Heath was wrong for what he tried to do , but you ’re upset because … why ? You ’re threatened ? Territorial ? ”
71136	71165	71129	71129	My	0	“ I ’m not a toy , Dante . You do n’t get to toss me aside and pick me back up only when someone else wants me . ”

71181	71209	71177	71177	he	1853	“ Then why do you care ? Why did you punch Heath when you were the one who told me to leave our feelings out of this ? ”
71252	71292	71293	71293	I	0	“ We ’re only together because of a deal you made with my father . What ’s it to you if my ex shows back up in my life ? You know the wedding would move forward either way , ”
71296	71328	71293	71293	I	0	“ Are you afraid I ’ll break the engagement ? Run off with Heath and leave you looking like a fool in front of your friends ? Why do you care ? ”
71329	71335	71339	71339	his	1853	“ I do n’t know ! ”
71357	71377	71346	71346	Dante	258	“ I do n’t know why I care . I just know I do , and I hate it . ”
71385	71447	71382	71382	his	1853	“ I hate the idea of you touching anyone else , or anyone else touching you . I hate that other people can make you laugh in a way I ca n’t . I hate how I feel around you , like you ’re the only person that can make me lose control when I. Do n’t . Lose . Control . ”
71472	71477	71478	71478	His	1853	“ But I do . ”

71533	71543	71544	71544	I	0	“ I do n’t know is n’t good enough , ”
71595	71643	71582	71582	his	1853	“ Heath said he still loves you . Enough to go against your parents , and me , to be with you . But you broke up two years ago and he did n’t do a damn thing about it until he found out you were engaged . ”
71651	71683	71582	71582	his	1853	“ You want to know the truth , Vivian ? If I loved you as much as he claims to love you , nothing would ’ve stopped me from keeping you . ”
71730	71733	71734	71734	I	0	“ If , ”
71742	71745	71734	71734	I	0	“ Hypothetical . ”

72575	72581	72582	72582	His	1856	“ Because you ’re mine . ”
72588	72622	72582	72582	His	1856	“ You wear my ring . You ’ve come on my face and hand . You live in my head all the fucking time , even if I do n’t want you to ... ”
72639	72661	72623	72623	His	1856	“ And God , I want to punish you for driving me so damn crazy . Every . Single . Day . ”
72806	72811	72812	72812	Dante	258	“ Open your eyes , ”
72815	72826	72827	72827	I	0	“ Look in the mirror when I ’m fucking you . ”
72924	72929	72930	72930	he	1856	“ You like this ? ”
72933	72949	72930	72930	he	1856	“ Watching me wreck your pussy while you make a mess all over my cock ? ”
73001	73015	73016	73016	His	1856	“ I ’m the only one who gets to see you like this . ”
73021	73022	73016	73016	His	1856	“ You”—thrust—”are”—thrust—”my”—thrust—”wife
73024	73056	73016	73016	His	1856	” The force of his fucking increased with each word until the last plunge pitched me forward . If not for his hold , I would ’ve collapsed on the floor . “
73065	73083	73016	73016	His	1856	” I managed over the thundering of my heart . Dante ’s grip tightened around my throat . “
73087	73092	73016	73016	His	1856	” he said darkly . “
73107	73143	73098	73098	You	0	” He dragged his cock out slowly , letting me feel every inch of him , before slamming it back in . Electric sensations shot through me , turning my body into a live wire . “
73150	73211	73098	73098	You	0	” No , it did n’t . It felt like hope . It felt like desire . It felt like ruin and salvation all in one . Dante ’s pace slowed , but the power in each thrust remained vicious . Still , his next words contained a shadow of vulnerability that took what was left of my breath away . “
73222	73323	73217	73217	you	0	” The rawness of his voice matched the desire in his eyes — dark and fathomless and so visceral I felt it in my bones . It was that look and those words , spoken in that voice , that finally tipped me over the edge . I came with a sharp cry , my body shuddering around his . He followed soon after , his cock pulsing inside me until we were both spent and gasping for air . We held on to each other , our breaths gradually evening in unison as we came down from our highs . “
73331	73478	73217	73217	you	0	” Dante ’s soft command brushed against my skin . I did . Our reflections stared back at us , dazed and slick with sweat . His arms wrapped around me from behind , and his cheek pressed against mine as our gazes connected in the mirror . Something that was both ache and fullness tugged at my heart . What we ’d had was n’t soft , emotional sex , at least not on the surface . But beneath the rough hands and filthy words , a storm of emotions had blown through and upended our entire relationship . Six months of pent - up frustration , lust , anger , and everything in between , all unleashed in one night . I would n’t know the aftermath until morning . But I knew there was no going back to the way things used to be .
73563	73569	73557	73557	My	0	“ Where are you going ? ”

73912	73915	73916	73916	My	0	“ No ? ”
73928	73931	73916	73916	My	0	“ No . ”

74076	74095	74067	74067	I	0	“ Heath came over last night because he said I texted him about wanting to get back together . ”
74114	74121	74109	74109	he	1871	“ I did n’t . Well … ”
74127	74208	74109	74109	he	1871	“ He showed me his phone , and there is a text that looks like it was from me , but I never sent it . Maybe it was a prank or a hack . I do n’t know , but it does n’t matter . My answer to his … proposal has n’t changed since the last time we spoke . He refused to accept that , and we went back and forth for hours until you showed up . ”
74304	74328	74329	74329	Dante	258	“ Did you say no because you no longer have feelings for him , or because you feel obligated to keep our arrangement ? ”
74335	74347	74329	74329	Dante	258	“ Does it matter ? We ’re getting married either way . ”
74363	74373	74359	74359	His	417	“ I would n’t ask if it did n’t . ”
74374	74389	74390	74390	Dante	258	“ Yet you have n’t answered my question about whether this is still business . ”
74422	74435	74414	74414	His	417	“ How many times are you going to make me say it ? ”
74436	74440	74441	74441	I	0	“ Just once , ”
74473	74498	74499	74499	he	417	“ Business would be staying in California and celebrating a deal I ’d worked a year on instead of rushing back to see you , ”
74511	74561	74499	74499	he	417	“ Business would be completing my D.C. trip instead of waking my pilot up for a last - minute flight home . In all my years as CEO , I ’ve only cut a work trip short twice , Vivian , and both those instances were because of you . ”
74569	74581	74566	74566	his	417	“ So no , it ’s not just fucking business anymore . ”
74619	74622	74627	74627	his	417	“ Oh . ”
74630	74635	74636	74636	he	417	“ Yes , oh , ”
74640	74655	74636	74636	he	417	“ Your turn , mia cara . Why did you say no to Heath ? ”
74687	74699	74700	74700	I	0	“ Because I do n’t have romantic feelings for him anymore , ”
74707	74718	74700	74700	I	0	“ And because I might have them for someone else . ”
74895	74904	74905	74905	I	0	“ It ’s not just business for you . ”
74916	74926	74905	74905	I	0	“ And it ’s not just duty for me . ”
74953	74956	74947	74947	we	1889	“ Good . ”
75011	75039	75004	75004	I	0	“ Well , I ’m glad we had that talk . I really do have a work crisis , so I ’ll get back to my room — ”

75064	75090	75091	75091	I	0	“ I hate to tell you this , but this is not , in fact , where I ’ve been sleeping the past five months , ”
75095	75122	75091	75091	I	0	“ My room is at the other end of the hall . You made a big show of distinguishing it when I moved in . Remember ? ”
75123	75143	75144	75144	Dante	258	“ Yes , but I think it ’s clear the boundaries we set that day are no longer applicable . ”
75150	75156	75144	75144	Dante	258	“ Do n’t you agree ? ”
75163	75169	75157	75157	My	0	“ What are you suggesting ? ”
75170	75190	75191	75191	His	1892	“ That we set new boundaries . No more separate bedrooms , no more sneaking out in the morning … ”
75195	75203	75191	75191	His	1892	“ And no more contact with Heath . ”
75260	75265	75266	75266	I	0	“ What a shame , ”

75287	75293	75281	75281	Dante	258	“ It was a joke . ”
75299	75321	75296	75296	I	0	“ On that note , if we ’re setting new boundaries , I have a few of my own . One … ”
75330	75365	75322	75322	I	0	“ No more scowling as your default expression . Your face is close to freezing that way , and I ’d rather not wake up to the Grinch for the rest of my life . ”
75366	75376	75377	75377	he	1892	“ I ’m much better looking than the Grinch , ”
75380	75396	75377	75377	he	1892	“ And if people stopped pissing me off , I would n’t scowl so much . ”
75397	75431	75322	75322	I	0	“ Other people are n’t the problem . Remember when we passed by a dog park around Christmas and saw those adorable huskies ? You glared at them so hard they started howling . ”
75432	75440	75441	75441	he	1892	“ I was n’t glaring at them , ”
75445	75465	75441	75441	he	1892	“ I was glaring at their outfits . Who dresses their dogs up as reindeer ? It ’s ridiculous . ”
75466	75480	75481	75481	Dante	258	“ It was Christmas . At least they were n’t dressed as elves . ”
75493	75496	75497	75497	I	0	“ Anyway . ”
75512	75560	75497	75497	I	0	“ Back to the boundaries . No more disappearing for weeks at a time with less than forty - eight hours ’ notice unless it ’s truly an emergency . No more shutting down when you ’re upset and things do n’t go your way . And … ”

75641	75648	75627	75627	Dante	258	“ That ’s not the point . ”
75656	75677	75627	75627	Dante	258	“ We ’re getting married in a few months , and we have n’t gone on a single real date . ”
75678	75692	75627	75627	Dante	258	“ We ’ve been on dates . We went to the Valhalla gala . ”

76571	76605	76564	76564	Vivian	258	“ Please tell me you took advantage of the jukebox when you were younger . I would kill for a photo of twelve - year - old you drinking a milkshake and dancing . ”
76606	76634	76564	76564	Vivian	258	“ Sorry , sweetheart , but that ’s not gon na happen . I ’m not a jukebox kinda guy . Not even when I was prepubescent . ”
76635	76653	76654	76654	she	258	“ I ’m not surprised , but you could ’ve let a girl dream a little longer , ”

76797	76808	76791	76791	Vivian	258	“ The original venue for the Legacy Ball got flooded . ”

76964	76971	76972	76972	I	0	“ The New York Public Library ? ”
76975	76979	76972	76972	I	0	“ Also booked . ”
77002	77010	76991	76991	I	0	“ You could host it at Valhalla . ”
77017	77025	77011	77011	Vivian	258	“ They do n’t allow outside events . ”
77026	77057	77011	77011	Vivian	258	“ No , but the Legacy Ball is extremely prestigious . Most , if not all , members will be there . They ’d consider it if I asked them . ”
77077	77087	77088	77088	she	258	“ I ca n’t ask you to do that , ”

77239	77258	77232	77232	her	258	“ Fine , but I ’m looking into alternatives , anyway . Valhalla will be the last resort . ”
77259	77296	77232	77232	her	258	“ Do n’t let anyone else from the club hear you say that , or you really will be blacklisted . Even I wo n’t be able to save you from ninety - nine bruised egos . ”

77543	77595	77596	77596	She	258	“ I know what you must think of my family , and you ’re not entirely wrong . Money and status mean a lot to them . Me marrying a Russo is … well , it ’s the ultimate achievement , in their eyes . But I ’m not my family . ”
77604	77658	77659	77659	she	258	“ Do n’t get me wrong . I like nice clothes and fancy vacations as much as the next person , but marrying a billionaire was never my end goal in life . I like you because of you , not because of your money . Even if you piss me off sometimes , ”

78365	78416	78358	78358	His	192	“ Because you ’re a smart man , Heath . What you did in my penthouse was dumb , but you had enough brains to scale your company to where it is today . You would n’t want anything to happen to it before the big IPO , would you ? ”
78423	78429	78358	78358	His	192	“ Are you threatening me ? ”
78430	78438	78439	78439	I	0	“ No . I ’m advising you . ”
78449	78469	78439	78439	I	0	“ Threatening you would be warning you to stay the fuck away from Vivian if you value your life . ”
78477	78514	78470	78470	My	0	“ I told you last week , and I ’ll tell you again . She ’s my fiancée . If you step foot near her again , if you so much as breathe in her direction … ”

78597	78648	78590	78590	I	0	“ See , that ’s what I would say if I were threatening you . But we wo n’t get to that point , will we ? Because you ’ll stay in California , have your nice IPO , and lose Vivian ’s number the way a smart man would . ”
78653	78656	78649	78649	His	192	“ Now … ”
78662	78688	78657	78657	I	0	“ I would stay and chat longer , but I have a date with my fiancée . Dinner and a sunset sail . Her favorite . ”
78804	78812	78813	78813	I	0	“ The IPO we were talking about , ”
78828	78832	78820	78820	I	0	“ Kill it . ”

79221	79224	79225	79225	I	0	“ No . ”
79233	79245	79225	79225	I	0	“ You ’re a tough nut to crack , Mr. Russo . ”
79252	79275	79249	79249	his	192	“ You ’ll thank me once we get there . This is a surprise that has to be shown , not told . ”
79349	79371	79372	79372	I	0	“ If you tell me now , I ’ll stop putting those flowers you hate so much in the guest bathrooms , ”

83421	83463	83418	83418	I	0	“ Tons . One was plotting to overthrow the ruler of the kingdom . Another was having an affair with her awful husband ’s most trusted guard . Shooting stars were people who ’d been exiled and cast down to earth . ”
83472	83479	83464	83464	Dante	258	“ Sounds like a soap opera . ”
83480	83492	83493	83493	I	0	“ We were children . We had active imaginations , okay ? ”

83908	83952	83899	83899	I	0	“ It ’s a lucky number in Chinese culture because it ’s associated with wealth . When my parents were house hunting , they specifically looked for places with eight in their address . My father is very superstitious about things like that . ”

84097	84122	84093	84093	he	417	“ But if we ’re being honest , Francis and I will never be best friends . We have different … outlooks on life . ”
84139	84146	84147	84147	he	417	“ No more talk about family , ”
84150	84178	84147	84147	he	417	“ We have the room to ourselves for the night , and I can think of a few other things that I would much rather be doing … ”
84424	84434	84435	84435	He	154	“ I ’m glad we could make this work . ”
84446	84458	84435	84435	He	154	“ I hope we ’re not disrupting your plans too much . ”
84459	84464	84465	84465	Vivian	258	“ Not at all . ”
84480	84488	84467	84467	her	258	“ We ’re thrilled to see you . ”
84539	84564	84565	84565	Cecelia	166	“ We have n’t seen you since Christmas , so we figured we ’d check in . See how the wedding planning is going . ”
84571	84592	84565	84565	Cecelia	166	“ You never answered my question the other day about the flowers . Shall we go ahead with the lilies ? ”
84683	84686	84687	84687	she	258	“ Yes , ”
84690	84696	84687	84687	she	258	“ The lilies are fine . ”
84697	84700	84701	84701	Cecelia	166	“ Excellent . ”
84704	84711	84701	84701	Cecelia	166	“ Now , about the cake — ”
84742	84767	84768	84768	Francis	154	“ We ’ll have the Golden Imperial caviar and tuna tartare on foie gras to start , and the lamb chops for the main , ”
84792	84801	84802	84802	Vivian	258	“ I ’ll have the tagliatelle , please , ”
84810	84835	84805	84805	Francis	154	“ This is n’t an Italian restaurant , Vivian . They ’re known for their lamb . Why do n’t you get that instead ? ”
84892	84905	84906	84906	Francis	154	“ The waitlist for a Le Charles reservation is four months long , ”
84909	84939	84906	84906	Francis	154	“ Even the governor has trouble getting a table when he ’s in town . It ’s ridiculous to waste a meal here on anything other than their best . ”
84940	84943	84944	84944	Vivian	258	“ I … ”
84947	84963	84964	84964	She	258	“ You ’re right . Can I change my order to the lamb , please ? ”
84972	84976	84964	84964	She	258	“ Thank you . ”
84977	84981	84982	84983	The server	2046	“ Of course . ”
85006	85014	85015	85015	I	0	“ And for you , Mr. Russo ? ”
85034	85041	85015	85015	I	0	“ I ’d like the tagliatelle . ”
85086	85093	85094	85094	Francis	154	“ How ’s your brother doing ? ”
85097	85119	85094	85094	Francis	154	“ I hear he ’s working a sales job at Lohman & Sons now . Seems … below his pay grade . ”
85120	85127	85128	85128	I	0	“ He ’s doing just fine , ”
85132	85147	85128	85128	I	0	“ Contribution is contribution , whether it ’s in a retail or corporate role . ”
85148	85151	85152	85152	He	154	“ Hmm . ”
85160	85169	85152	85152	He	154	“ We ’ll have to agree to disagree . ”
85414	85416	85408	85408	Cecelia	166	“ wrong ”
85482	85492	85493	85493	she	258	“ Whatever you want to say , say it , ”
85516	85528	85500	85500	She	258	“ You ’ve been silently fuming the entire car ride home . ”
85544	85566	85567	85567	Vivian	258	“ Not fuming . Simply wondering how you overcame your lifelong disdain for lamb within the past twenty - four hours . ”
85570	85583	85567	85567	Vivian	258	“ It ’s one meal . It ’s not a big deal . “
85584	85594	85567	85567	Vivian	258	“ It ’s not about the food , Vivian . ”
85601	85635	85636	85636	I	0	“ It ’s about the way your parents treat you like you ’re a child . It ’s about how you turn into a cardboard cutout of yourself whenever you ’re around them . ”
85642	85675	85636	85636	I	0	“ This is n’t you . You hate lamb . You ’re not a tweed and pearls person . You would n’t be caught dead in that outfit on a normal day . ”
85676	85686	85693	85693	her	258	“ Well , it ’s not a normal day . ”
85706	85792	85696	85696	I	0	“ Do you think I enjoy having my parents show up at the last minute ? Or that I like being criticized for everything I say and wear ? Maybe this is n’t what I ’d choose to wear if they were n’t here , and maybe I would n’t have ordered the lamb if my father had n’t insisted , but sometimes you have to compromise to keep the peace . They ’re here for two days . It ’s not a big deal . ”
85793	85808	85809	85809	I	0	“ It ’s two days this time , but what about in the future ? ”
85816	85855	85812	85812	my	0	“ Every holiday , every visit , for the rest of your life . Tell me it ’s not exhausting pretending to be someone you ’re not with the two people who should accept you as you are . ”
85859	85891	85856	85856	Vivian	258	“ People do that every day . They go to work and show one side of themselves . They go out with friends and show another side . It ’s normal . ”
85892	85918	85919	85919	My	0	“ Yeah , except they ’re not your colleagues or your fucking friends . They ’re your family , and they treat you like shit ! ”
85927	85933	85934	85934	Vivian	258	“ They ’re my parents ! ”
85942	86028	85934	85934	Vivian	258	“ They ’re not perfect , but they have my best interests at heart . They sacrificed a lot to give me and my sister the type of life they never had growing up . Even before we were rich , they worked their butts off to make sure we could afford the same clothes and field trips as our classmates so we were n’t left out . So if I have to give up some things temporarily to make them happy , I will . ”
86029	86055	86056	86056	Vivian	258	“ Temporarily , huh ? Is that why your father basically sold you both off in exchange for a rung up on the social ladder ? ”
86073	86076	85934	85934	Vivian	258	“ Viv — ”
86077	86080	86081	86081	She	258	“ No . ”
86087	86104	86081	86081	She	258	“ That was exactly what you meant to say , so do n’t take it back . ”
86109	86197	86081	86081	She	258	“ I do n’t see you as a bargaining chip , but can you honestly tell me your parents feel the same way ? I ’m not trying to make you feel bad , amore mio , but you do n’t have to put up with their bullshit . You ’re an adult . You ’re beautiful , successful , intelligent , and three times the person either of them will ever be . You have your own money and career . You do n’t need them . ”
86198	86211	86081	86081	She	258	“ It ’s not about needing them . It ’s about family . ”
86220	86250	86216	86216	Vivian	258	“ We do things differently , okay ? Respect for our elders is important . We do n’t talk back just because we do n’t like what they say . ”
86251	86273	86274	86274	I	0	“ Yeah , well , sometimes elders are full of horseshit , and you need to call them out on it . ”
86309	86313	86314	86314	she	258	“ You can , ”
86318	86374	86314	86314	she	258	“ You grew up the heir to the Russo empire . Yes , I know it was n’t all fun and games , but you were still the center of your grandfather ’s attention . I had to be perfect just to get an ounce of affection . My grades , my image , everything . ”
86375	86396	86314	86314	she	258	“ That ’s my fucking point ! You should n’t have to be perfect to get your parents ’ affection ! ”
86397	86406	86407	86407	We	2066	“ That ’s my point ! I do ! ”
86433	86446	86447	86447	she	258	“ It ’s been a long night , and I ’m tired , ”
86450	86506	86447	86447	she	258	“ But I wish you ’d at least try to see where I ’m coming from . Your view of the world is not universal . I want a partner , Dante , not someone who ’ll berate me because he does n’t agree with the way I handle my relationship with my own family . ”
86515	86518	86507	86507	Remorse	291	“ Sweetheart … ”
86519	86540	86549	86549	her	2069	“ I ’m going to take a bath and do some work after . Do n’t wait up for me . ”
86577	86596	86597	86597	Isabella	178	“ Congrats ! You had your first fight as a real couple . Let ’s toast to that . ”
86620	86630	86631	86631	I	0	“ It ’s not something to celebrate , Isa , ”
86635	86656	86657	86657	She	178	“ Of course it is . You wanted the full couple experience . That includes fights , especially over family . ”
86672	86720	86657	86657	She	178	“ Honestly , couples who do n’t fight freak me out . They ’re like one broken dish away from snapping . The next thing you know , they ’ll be the subjects of a Netflix documentary series titled Love and Murder : The Couple Next Door . ”
86728	86738	86739	86739	Isabella	178	“ You listen to way too much true crime . ”
86798	86803	86804	86804	Isabella	178	“ It ’s research , ”
86807	86851	86804	86804	Isabella	178	“ Therefore , it ’s work . You ca n’t blame me for working overtime , can you ? Look at Sloane . She ’s on her phone even though the world ’s best eggs Benedict is sitting untouched in front of her . ”
86852	86863	86864	86864	Sloane	179	“ It ’s not untouched . I ate two bites . ”
86874	86906	86907	86907	She	179	“ You try enjoying your food when one of your clients posts a social media tirade about their very famous ex - wife and proceeds to get into online arguments with … ”
86913	86926	86907	86907	She	179	“ User59806 about who should drive their car off a cliff first . ”
86927	86934	86935	86935	Isabella	178	“ Sounds tame for the internet , ”
86938	87006	87007	87007	She	178	“ I ’m kidding . Sort of . Look , there ’s not much you can do about it now except take away your client ’s social media access , which I assume you ’ve already done . People will act stupid all day , every day . Enjoy your food , and deal with them later . Two hours of digital detox wo n’t kill you . ”
87016	87032	87007	87007	She	178	“ Plus , you need energy for all the fire breathing you ’ll do later . ”
87038	87045	87035	87035	her	179	“ I suppose you ’re right . ”
87046	87054	87055	87055	Isabella	178	“ I ’m always right . Now … ”
87063	87098	87055	87055	Isabella	178	“ This fight . I think you should let it go on for another day before you have hot makeup sex . Three days is adequate time for all that tension to build and — ”
87099	87102	87035	87035	her	179	“ Isa . ”
87103	87128	87129	87129	She	178	“ I ’m sorry ! I do n’t have a sex life at the moment , okay ? I ’m living vicariously through you . ”
87132	87148	87129	87129	She	178	“ And the argument is n’t a dealbreaker , right ? He ’s kind of … ”
87175	87188	87189	87189	Isabella	178	“ Do n’t get me wrong . I know how you feel . ”
87194	87239	87189	87189	Isabella	178	“ But I think it ’s one of those cultural differences that ’ll take time to smooth over . Dante cares about you , or he would n’t have been so upset . He ’s just … not great at expressing his thoughts tactfully . ”
87240	87244	87245	87245	My	0	“ I know . ”
87254	87277	87245	87245	My	0	“ It ’s just hard to remember that when I ’m in the moment and he ’s being so … so stubborn . ”
87358	87364	87365	87365	Sloane	179	“ He ’s Dante Russo , ”
87374	87401	87365	87365	Sloane	179	“ Inflexibility is his middle name . Personally , I think you should make him sweat . Shut him out until he comes to his senses . ”
87402	87418	87419	87419	Isabella	178	“ Great . So we ’ll be waiting until the turn of the next century , ”
87422	87432	87419	87419	Isabella	178	“ Viv , what do you want to do ? ”
87433	87436	87365	87365	Sloane	179	“ I — ”
87437	87445	87419	87419	Isabella	178	“ Vivian . What a pleasant surprise . ”
87482	87492	87493	87493	I	0	“ Buffy , it ’s nice to see you , ”
87512	87517	87518	87518	I	0	“ How are you ? ”
87532	87544	87530	87530	Buffy	212	“ I ’m well , dear . Thank you for asking . ”
87575	87589	87590	87590	Her	2082	“ I normally do n’t come all the way down to the Bowery … ”
87616	87626	87590	87590	Her	2082	“ But I hear the brunch here is divine . ”
87627	87636	87637	87637	I	0	“ The best lobster eggs Benedict in town . ”
87644	87652	87637	87637	I	0	“ Would you like to join us ? ”
87670	87684	87685	87685	Buffy	212	“ Oh , what a sweet offer , but no , thank you , ”
87690	87716	87717	87717	She	212	“ Bunny and I reserved the corner table . She ’s glaring at me as we speak — she simply hates sitting alone in public … ”
87769	87798	87760	87760	Buffy	212	“ However , I wanted to stop by and congratulate you in person on securing Valhalla for the Legacy Ball venue . It ’s generated quite the buzz . ”
87799	87803	87804	87804	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
87915	87928	87929	87929	Buffy	212	“ I ’m sure Dante put in a good word for you . ”
87932	87944	87929	87929	Buffy	212	“ It pays to marry a Russo , does n’t it ? ”
87960	87979	87980	87980	she	212	“ Since we ’re on the subject of the ball , I have a suggestion regarding the entertainment , ”
87983	87998	87980	87980	she	212	“ It ’s a shame Corelli lost his voice and can no longer perform . ”
88060	88072	88073	88073	I	0	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ve already confirmed an alternative , ”
88076	88101	88073	88073	I	0	“ There ’s a wonderful jazz singer who agreed to perform for half her regular rate considering the audience that ’ll be in attendance . ”
88102	88106	88107	88107	Buffy	212	“ How lovely , ”
88110	88123	88107	88107	Buffy	212	“ However , I was thinking we should book Veronica Foster instead . ”
88124	88132	88073	88073	I	0	“ Veronica Foster … the sugar heiress ? ”
88133	88142	88143	88143	Buffy	212	“ She ’s transitioned into the music scene , ”
88147	88165	88143	88143	Buffy	212	“ I ’m sure she would appreciate the opportunity to perform at the ball . As would I. ”
88192	88209	88186	88186	She	298	“ I ’m happy to meet with her and review her tape if she has one . ”
88222	88255	88210	88210	I	0	“ However , I ca n’t guarantee a spot in the lineup . As you know , the schedule is tight , and I ’ve already agreed to book the jazz singer . ”
88264	88277	88278	88278	she	212	“ I ’m sure she ’d understand if you had to cancel , ”
88290	88307	88278	88278	she	212	“ This is an important event , Vivian . There ’s a lot riding on it . ”
88402	88408	88409	88409	I	0	“ Yes , there is , ”
88424	88491	88416	88416	Frost	299	“ That ’s why every detail must be flawless , including the performers . As the chair of the Legacy Ball committee , I ’m sure you understand anything less than perfection on stage would not be ideal . I have full faith in Veronica ’s commitment to her craft , which is why an audition should n’t be a problem . Would n’t you agree ? ”
88622	88625	88626	88626	she	212	“ Yes , ”
88630	88637	88626	88626	she	212	“ I suppose you ’re right . ”
88666	88674	88675	88675	She	212	“ Enjoy the rest of your meal . ”
88693	88712	88685	88685	she	212	“ And Vivian ? I expect this to be the best Legacy Ball in the event ’s history . ”
88761	88767	88753	88753	she	212	“ Telling off Buffy Darlington . ”
88777	88780	88768	88768	Sloane	179	“ Impressive . ”
88781	88789	88790	88790	I	0	“ I did n’t tell her off , ”
88793	88800	88790	88790	I	0	“ I presented an alternative viewpoint . ”
88801	88807	88808	88808	Isabella	178	“ You told her off , ”
88811	88840	88808	88808	Isabella	178	“ There was a moment when I thought she would have a coronary and collapse right into your eggs . Buffy and Benedict , the new brunch combo . ”
88915	88921	88922	88922	Isabella	178	“ Speaking of B names , ”
88935	88953	88922	88922	Isabella	178	“ Did I hear wrong , or did she say she was here with her friend Bunny ? ”
88954	88959	88960	88960	I	0	“ Bunny Van Houten , ”
88966	88976	88960	88960	I	0	“ Wife of Dutch shipping magnate Dirk Van Houten . ”
88987	88995	88996	88996	she	178	“ Who comes up with these names ? ”
88999	89018	88996	88996	she	178	“ Is there a rule that the richer you are , the uglier your name has to be ? ”
89019	89026	89041	89041	her	178	“ They ’re not that bad . ”
89027	89038	89039	89039	Isabella	178	“ Buffy and Bunny , Viv ! Buffy and Bunny ! ”
89044	89073	89041	89041	her	178	“ Once I have the power , I ’m banning all names beginning with the letters B and U. God forbid they add a Bubby to their group . ”
89197	89209	89210	89210	Sloane	179	“ There ’s a new romantic comedy coming out next week , ”
89213	89219	89210	89210	Sloane	179	“ Let ’s watch it . ”
89226	89246	89247	89247	Sloane	179	“ Will you actually watch the movie this time , or will you just complain during the entire film ? ”
89253	89275	89247	89247	Sloane	179	“ I do n’t complain . I provide real - time criticism of the film ’s application in the real world . ”
89276	89284	89285	89285	I	0	“ It ’s a rom - com , ”
89288	89297	89285	89285	I	0	“ They ’re not supposed to be realistic . ”
89341	89348	89349	89349	she	179	“ We ’ll agree to disagree , ”
89352	89362	89349	89349	she	179	“ Next Thursday after work . Does that work ? ”
89544	89547	89548	89548	I	0	“ Hi , ”

89714	89720	89721	89721	he	2113	“ I wanted to apologize , ”
89724	89755	89721	89721	he	2113	“ For Friday night . You were right . I should ’ve tried harder to understand where you were coming from instead of … ambushing you when we went home . ”
89783	89789	89790	89790	I	0	“ You were right too , ”
89793	89819	89790	89790	I	0	“ I do n’t like admitting it out loud , but I am different around my parents . I wish I was n’t , but … ”
89826	89839	89790	89790	I	0	“ There are some things that might be too late to change . ”
89883	89892	89893	89893	Dante	258	“ It ’s never too late for change . ”
89899	89925	89893	89893	Dante	258	“ You ’re fucking perfect the way you are , Vivian . If your parents ca n’t see that , then it ’s their loss . ”
89961	89977	89957	89957	I	0	“ Maybe I ’ll wear a silk suit instead of tweed at our next dinner , ”
89983	89990	89978	89978	I	0	“ Spice things up a bit . ”
89991	90034	90063	90063	He	2125	“ Silk suits you better , anyway . Next time they drop in for a surprise visit , we can also tell them we ’ve contracted a terrible , highly contagious stomach bug and lock ourselves in our apartment until they leave . ”
90035	90042	90043	90043	I	0	“ Hmm , I like it . ”
90048	90062	90063	90063	He	2125	“ But what would we do , locked all day in the apartment ? ”
90070	90079	90063	90063	He	2125	“ I can think of a few things . ”
90094	90103	90104	90104	I	0	“ I ’m sure you can . So , ”
90110	90123	90104	90104	I	0	“ Do you have any plans for the rest of the day ? ”
90124	90127	90128	90128	He	2125	“ Yes . ”
90144	90152	90128	90128	He	2125	“ I ’m spending it with you . ”
90225	90228	90229	90229	I	0	“ Perfect , ”
90246	90264	90232	90232	I	0	“ Because there ’s a new exhibit at the Whitney I ’ve been dying to check out … ”
90268	90280	90281	90281	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , you want us to go where ? ”
90295	90298	90281	90281	I	0	“ Paris . ”
90374	90396	90397	90397	he	2125	“ I found out today I have to meet some of our subsidiary CEOs there ahead of the Cannes Film Festival , ”
90400	90428	90397	90397	he	2125	“ My VP was supposed to do it , but his wife went into early labor . I ’m leaving Saturday and staying there for a week . ”
90478	90483	90484	90484	I	0	“ I ca n’t , ”
90488	90498	90484	90484	I	0	“ I have to be here for ball prep . ”
90504	90513	90501	90501	his	2125	“ I thought everything ’s pretty much set . ”
90582	90612	90575	90575	I	0	“ Yes , but still . This is the biggest event of my career . I ca n’t fly off at the last minute . My team needs me . ”
90613	90628	90629	90629	Dante	258	“ Your team seems competent enough to hold down the fort for five days . ”
90639	90699	90629	90629	Dante	258	“ You ’ll still have over a week when we get back to finalize everything , and you do n’t need to be physically in New York to do your work in the meantime . I ’ll be busy in the mornings too , so we work during the day and explore Paris at night . Win - win . ”
90700	90707	90708	90708	I	0	“ What about the time difference ? ”
90711	90725	90708	90708	I	0	“ My team will still be working when it ’s evening in Paris . ”
90726	90742	90743	90743	Dante	258	“ So schedule your meetings for the early afternoon . It ’ll be morning here , ”
90750	90771	90743	90743	Dante	258	“ It ’s Paris in spring , mia cara . Beautiful flowers , fresh croissants , walks along the Seine … ”
90772	90778	90779	90779	I	0	“ I do n’t know … ”
90797	90807	90808	90808	Dante	258	“ I already booked a suite at the Ritz . ”
90819	90836	90808	90808	Dante	258	“ And you can pick out a gown from the Yves Dubois showroom for the ball . ”
90844	90849	90808	90808	Dante	258	“ That ’s cheating . ”
90920	90926	90927	90927	Dante	258	“ It ’s an incentive . ”
90930	90967	90927	90927	Dante	258	“ If you really ca n’t or do n’t want to come , you do n’t have to . But you ’ve been working damn hard these past few months . You deserve a little break . ”
90968	90987	90988	90988	I	0	“ Nice way to spin it . Are you sure it ’s not because you have separation anxiety ? ”
90991	90998	90988	90988	I	0	“ I did n’t use to . ”
91014	91024	90999	90999	His	302	“ But I ’m beginning to think I might . ”
91064	91074	91054	91054	I	0	“ Then I guess I ’m going to Paris . ”
91334	91339	91340	91340	Yves	302	“ Not that one . ”
91358	91383	91384	91384	He	302	“ Pink is too soft for you , darling . You need something bolder , more daring . Something that ’ll make a statement . ”
91399	91408	91394	91394	he	302	“ Frederic , bring me the Phoenix gown . ”
91433	91438	91439	91439	Yves	302	“ My latest creation , ”
91445	91477	91439	91439	Yves	302	“ Eight hundred hours to hand sew , bursts of gold thread embroidered over the entire surface of the gown . My finest work to date , in my humble opinion . ”
91507	91519	91520	91520	he	302	“ Normally , it ’s one hundred and fifty thousand dollars , ”
91523	91549	91520	91520	he	302	“ But for you , the future Mrs. Russo , to wear it at the Legacy Ball ? One hundred and thirty thousand . Even . ”
91557	91563	91520	91520	he	302	“ I ’ll take it . ”
91625	91637	91638	91638	Dante	258	“ Should I have booked a separate room for your purchases ? ”
91650	91663	91638	91638	Dante	258	“ You should ’ve , but it ’s too late for that . ”
91686	91693	91676	91676	I	0	“ I bought you something too . ”
91723	91730	91731	91731	I	0	“ They ’re ice cream cufflinks , ”
91735	91783	91731	91731	I	0	“ I know a jeweler on Rue de la Paix who makes customized pieces . The onyx is the soy sauce . The ruby is the cherry , even though you do n’t eat it with cherry , but I think the red ties the design together . ”
91813	91819	91820	91820	I	0	“ Do you like them ? ”
91823	91828	91829	91829	He	302	“ I love them . ”
91842	91849	91829	91829	He	302	“ Thank you , mia cara . ”
92073	92088	92089	92089	I	0	“ Okay , what ’s one food you ca n’t stand that everyone loves ? ”
92100	92119	92089	92089	I	0	“ I ’ll go first . Olives . I hate them . They ’re a blight to humanity . ”
92120	92145	92146	92146	Dante	258	“ I want to say I ’m surprised , but you ’re the same person who eats pickles with chips and pudding , so … ”
92154	92158	92148	92148	his	2166	“ Enough said . ”
92164	92188	92159	92159	I	0	“ I ’m not the one who cleaned out our pickle supply two weeks ago because he could n’t stop stealing my snack . ”
92189	92203	92204	92204	He	2166	“ Do n’t be dramatic . Greta bought more pickles the next day . ”
92210	92238	92204	92204	He	2166	“ To answer your question , I ca n’t stand popcorn . The texture ’s weird , and it smells awful even when it ’s not burnt . ”
92239	92250	92159	92159	I	0	“ Seriously ? Then what do you eat during movies ? ”
92251	92263	92264	92264	I	0	“ Nothing . Movies are for watching , not eating food . ”
92269	92286	92264	92264	I	0	“ Sometimes , I ’m convinced you ’re an alien and not an actual human being . ”
92293	92315	92316	92316	My	0	“ We all have our quirks , mia cara . At least I do n’t sing Mariah Carey in the shower . ”
92320	92343	92316	92316	My	0	“ I did that once . I heard the song in a commercial and it got stuck in my head , okay ? ”
92344	92355	92359	92359	his	2166	“ I ’m not saying it ’s a bad quirk . ”
92364	92377	92359	92359	his	2166	“ It was cute , even if it was off - key . ”
92378	92386	92387	92387	I	0	“ I was not off - key , ”
92403	92411	92412	92412	I	0	“ How ’s the prep for Cannes ? ”
92427	92436	92412	92412	I	0	“ Did you get everything done in time ? ”
92437	92470	92471	92471	he	2166	“ Yes , thankfully . If I had to sit in another meeting discussing what champagne we should serve at the after - party , I would ’ve been arrested for murder , ”
92474	92493	92494	92494	I	0	“ I ’m sure you would ’ve found a way out of it . You ’re a Russo , ”
92497	92512	92494	92494	I	0	“ Yes , but the paperwork would ’ve been a pain in the ass . ”
92513	92526	92412	92412	I	0	“ You love paperwork . That ’s what you do all day . ”
92527	92556	92557	92557	He	2166	“ I ’m going to pretend you did n’t just insult me horribly in the middle of what ’s supposed to be a romantic last night in Paris . ”
92573	92593	92568	92568	I	0	“ Do you ever think about what you would ’ve been if you had n’t been born a Russo ? ”
92617	92622	92623	92623	Dante	258	“ Once or twice . ”
92629	92666	92623	92623	Dante	258	“ I never know the answer . Work takes up most of my time , and while I enjoy my hobbies — boxing , tennis , travel — I would n’t have entertained them as careers . ”
92676	92684	92685	92685	he	2166	“ I ’m a businessman , Vivian , ”
92688	92735	92685	92685	he	2166	“ That ’s what I was born to be . I enjoy my work , even if certain aspects are not always fun . Do n’t think I ’m throwing my life ’s passion away to toil in a corner office because I feel obligated to . ”
92779	92783	92784	92784	he	2166	“ And you ? ”
92787	92799	92784	92784	he	2166	“ If not event planning , what would you be doing ? ”
92800	92822	92823	92823	I	0	“ I want to say I ’d be an astronomer , but honestly , I ’m terrible at math and science , ”
92826	92877	92823	92823	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I guess I ’m like you . I ’m happy doing what I ’m doing . Event planning can be stressful , but it ’s fun , creative … and there ’s nothing more satisfying than taking an idea and bringing it to life . ”
92884	92894	92881	92881	his	2166	“ So we ’re both happy where we are . ”
92906	92909	92910	92910	I	0	“ Yes , ”
92913	92919	92910	92910	I	0	“ I suppose we are . ”
92936	92945	92929	92929	I	0	“ I ’m glad I came to Paris . ”
92964	92967	92946	92946	Dante	258	“Me too . ”
93021	93032	93033	93033	he	2166	“ I ’m sorry . I have to take this , ”
93036	93040	93033	93033	he	2166	“ Work emergency . ”
93041	93046	93047	93047	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
93051	93059	93060	93060	He	2166	“ Do what you have to do . ”
93156	93163	93164	93164	I	0	“ We found all of them . ”
93167	93172	93164	93164	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
93221	93232	93233	93233	Christian	167	“ Yes . We have eyes on all eight locations , ”
93236	93252	93233	93233	Christian	167	“ Just say the word , and you ’ll be free of the Laus forever . ”
93431	93434	93435	93435	Christian	167	“ Dante ? ”
93446	93451	93438	93438	I	0	“ I heard you . ”
93462	93469	93438	93438	I	0	“ What about the business side ? ”
93470	93476	93438	93438	I	0	“ Also ready to go . ”
93477	93480	93438	93438	I	0	“ Good . ”
93489	93499	93500	93500	I	0	“ And our other project ? With the startup ? ”
93535	93545	93548	93548	Christian	167	“ Heath ’s company has run into some trouble . ”
93552	93582	93548	93548	Christian	167	“ The software has been plagued with issues lately . Employees are nervous . Investors are spooked . IPO looks dead in the water . It ’s deeply unfortunate . ”
93583	93586	93587	93587	I	0	“ Very . ”
93637	93649	93624	93624	She	2180	“ Honestly , it was so easy it was almost boring . ”
93653	93673	93650	93650	Christian	167	“ Now that that ’s out of the way , what do you want me to do about Francis ? ”
93697	93714	93715	93715	he	167	“ Let me remind you this is what you ’ve been working toward for eight months , ”
93718	93730	93715	93715	he	167	“ The man blackmailed you and threatened your brother ’s life . ”
93731	93737	93738	93738	I	0	“ I ’m well aware , ”
93855	93861	93862	93862	His	167	“ Your call , Russo . ”
93867	93874	93862	93862	His	167	“ What ’s our next move ? ”
94038	94055	94056	94056	Francis	154	“ Next time you see your brother , you should tell him to be more careful . ”
94071	94085	94056	94056	Francis	154	“ I would hate for these photos to get into Romano ’s hands . ”
94112	94134	94135	94135	Francis	154	“ Anyway , I ’m sure you ’re busy , so I wo n’t take up any more of your time . ”
94145	94171	94135	94135	Francis	154	“ Think about what I said . A marriage with my daughter would be quite beneficial , especially for the … longevity of your family . ”
94180	94186	94135	94135	Francis	154	“ Would n’t you agree ? ”
94271	94276	94266	94266	I	0	“ Take him down . ”
94319	94324	94325	94325	she	258	“ Is everything okay ? ”
94328	94337	94325	94325	she	258	“ You ’ve been quiet since the call . ”
94338	94343	94344	94344	I	0	“ Everything ’s fine . ”
94354	94362	94344	94344	I	0	“ Just annoyed it interrupted our dinner . ”
94363	94371	94372	94372	She	258	“ It was still a good dinner . ”
94384	94398	94372	94372	She	258	“ I ’ll dream of that dessert for the rest of my life . ”
94399	94410	94411	94411	Vivian	258	“ The dessert and not me ? I ’m offended . ”
94416	94425	94413	94413	her	258	“ Not everything revolves around you , Dante . ”
94426	94430	94431	94431	I	0	“ It should . ”
94627	94633	94607	94607	She	258	“ Last night in France . ”
94647	94656	94634	94634	I	0	“ I wonder how we should spend it … ”
94657	94690	94691	94691	Vivian	258	“ Well , I ’d originally planned to take a long bath , read , maybe put on that face mask you said makes me look like Jason from Friday the 13th … ”
94703	94712	94694	94694	her	258	“ But perhaps you have a better idea . ”

95367	95377	95355	95355	Vivian	258	“ That was definitely more fun than a bath . ”
95396	95405	95378	95378	I	0	“ My ego thanks you for the confirmation . ”
95406	95413	95414	95414	She	258	“ Tell it you ’re welcome . ”

96003	96049	95994	95994	Sloane	179	“ What was with the airplane scene ? And the love confession . I would throw up if anyone compared me to the planet Venus , especially after knowing me for only three weeks . How could anyone possibly fall in love in three weeks ? ”

That ’s one thing I ’ve realized now that I ’m older , Vivi . You ca n’t live your life trying to please others .

107376	107409	107432	107432	He	170	“ Christ , Dante , you could n’t have told me this earlier ? Why ’d I have to get a call from Greta fretting about how aliens took over your body ? ”
107410	107427	107428	107428	I	0	“ I do n’t know , Luca . Maybe because I was busy saving your ass , ”

107629	107671	107624	107624	I	0	“ But you were right to make me get a job . I actually like working at Lohman & Sons , and the structure has been good for me . It ’s nice not waking up with a hangover every day . ”
107680	107738	107739	107739	I	0	“ I admit , I was resentful as hell when you first brought it up . The whole blackmail thing did n’t seem real at the time , and I hated how you punished me like I was your child instead of your brother . The job , breaking up with Maria . I was … selfish . ”
107748	107777	107739	107739	I	0	“ I ’m not the one whose body was taken over by aliens . Who are you , and what the hell have you done to my brother ? ”
107781	107808	107809	107809	He	170	“ Like I said , the structure has been good for me . So has not hanging out with my old crowd as much . Actually … ”

107980	107992	108012	108012	Luca	170	“ What about Maria ? I thought you were in love . ”
107993	108011	108012	108012	Luca	170	“ I have n’t talked to her in — er , since we spoke in your office . ”
108015	108046	108012	108012	Luca	170	“ I was talking to Leaf about it . I think I mistook the thrill of the forbidden for love love , you know ? The two are easily confused . ”
108053	108070	108047	108047	You	2445	“ But enough about my love life . We were talking about yours . With Vivian . ”

108297	108386	108294	108294	I	0	“ What do you think will happen ? We ’ll have happy family meals at Thanksgiving after I destroy her father ’s company ? Get married in front of all our friends like the way we got together was n’t completely fucked ? If I marry her , Francis wins . He ’ll still have a Russo as an in - law . People will question why the fuck I ’m not saving him when his company goes up in flames . It ’ll be a goddamn mess ! ”
108387	108390	108391	108391	Luca	170	“ Sure , ”
108400	108417	108391	108391	Luca	170	“ But that does n’t answer my question . Do you want to be with her ? ”

108736	108748	108732	108734	a damn idiot	2449	“ When the hell did you turn into the older brother ? ”
108762	108788	108732	108734	a damn idiot	2449	“ Trust me , I ’m not , and I do n’t want to be . Too much responsibility . But that ’s the point . ”
108794	108818	108732	108734	a damn idiot	2449	“ You ’ve sacrificed a lot for me , Dante . I do n’t always acknowledge or openly appreciate it , but I … ”

That ’s what I meant when I said we need to fix our relationship . You ’ve always been a parent figure because I needed a parent figure . But now … I’d like us to try and be brothers . ”
108910	108913	108908	108908	Vivian	258	“ Meaning ? ”
108914	108930	108931	108931	He	2450	“ Meaning I ’ll try not to fuck up and have you bail me out . ”
108938	108990	108931	108931	He	2450	“ And I call you out on your bullshit when I need to , like now . You love Vivian . I saw it happening even in Bali . But you let her go because of what ? Your pride and vengeance ? Those things will only get you so far . ”

109121	109131	109132	109132	he	170	“ Because you ’ve protected me my whole life , ”
109136	109146	109132	109132	he	170	“ And it ’s time I returned the favor . ”

109853	109859	109860	109860	he	417	“ Do n’t be dramatic , ”
109863	109947	109860	109860	he	417	“ It was n’t anyone . It was Dante Russo . Do you know the doors marrying a Russo would open ? Even with our wealth and your sister ’s marriage , some people look down on us . They ’ll invite us to their parties , and they ’ll take our money for fundraisers , but they whisper behind our backs , Vivian . They think we ’re not good enough . Marriage to Dante would ’ve shut those whispers down immediately . ”

You and your sister grew up sheltered , Vivian . You have no idea what it took for me to get to where I am today because I shielded you from the ugly truth . The number of people who laughed in my face and stabbed me in the back … it would make you sick . You think the world is rose - colored when it ’s gray at best . ”

110833	110872	110830	110830	he	417	“ It might be more than a hiccup , in which case we could use Dante ’s help . He ’s upset now , but he has a soft spot for you . Convince him to … assist . ”

132230	132234	132235	132235	I	0	“ Shut up , ”
132256	132484	132247	132247	I	0	“ Unsolicited commentary is n’t the best man ’s job . I swept my eyes over the crowd , restless . Almost every guest had RSVP’d yes . I spotted Dominic and Alessandra between the Laurents and the Singhs , and Christian ’s girlfriend Stella seated next to Queen Bridget and Prince Rhys of Eldorra . Surprisingly , my parents had made it as well , and they ’d ditched their usual beach clothes for the appropriate wedding attire . My gaze skimmed over the Laus . Francis was here as Cecelia ’s plus one , but he ’d been stripped of all father - of - the - bride duties . Cecelia would be walking her down the aisle instead . It was a humiliating public snub for someone so obsessed with his reputation , but he must ’ve thought not attending was worse than attending as the guest of a guest . He sat next to his son - in - law , dour but silent . Vivian had agonized for weeks over whether to invite him before we settled on the current compromise . She was worried I ’d be upset , but I ’d pushed Francis so far in the back of my mind he was a speck in the rearview mirror . As long as Vivian was happy , I was happy . “
132497	132515	132489	132489	You	2846	” Luca said , bringing my attention back to him . He reeked of self - satisfaction . “
132530	132531	132489	132489	You	2846	” “
132549	132561	132489	132489	You	2846	” Whoever invented younger siblings deserved a special place in hell . “
132568	132577	132564	132564	you	2846	” Christian said from Luca ’s other side . “
132592	132921	132586	132586	I	0	” A - fucking - men . Kai was the only groomsman with the good sense to keep his mouth shut . He ’d fixed his gaze across the archway , where Agnes , Sloane , and Isabella stood in blush pink bridesmaid dresses . Isabella cocked an eyebrow at him ; his gaze narrowed a fraction before the rich , majestic tones of the wedding march filled the air and he flicked his eyes toward the aisle . The guests rose as one . All thoughts of annoying brothers and equally annoying groomsmen ceased when Vivian appeared at the end of the aisle . Hell , all thoughts ceased , period . The only thing that existed was her . My breath stilled as she walked down the aisle with her mother , her face glowing and her smile soft as she met my eyes . Vivian once told me about a Chinese proverb that said an invisible thread connected those destined to meet , regardless of time , place , and circumstance . I felt the phantom tug of that thread now , stretching between us and vibrating with the promise of something only fate could deliver . I used to think we would n’t be together if her father had n’t forced us together . I was wrong . A part of me would always find my way to her . She was my North Star , the brightest jewel in my sky . A suspicious haze blurred my vision when Vivian reached me . I blinked it back . If I did n’t , I ’d never hear the end of it from Luca , Christian , or Kai . Her mother handed her off to me . Cecelia had been upset when Vivian refused to let her bulldoze her way into wedding preparations . Now , she looked suspiciously misty - eyed . It seems she possessed emotions other than disapproval after all . “
132930	132943	132922	132922	You	2848	” Vivian murmured . Her hand was small and soft in mine . “
132955	132992	132952	132953	Mrs. Russo	211	” She wore a custom - made gown and the best hair and makeup money could buy , but even in a burlap sack , she ’d be the most beautiful woman I ’d ever seen . “
133014	133026	133027	133027	I	0	” she quipped . A wicked smile spread across my lips . “
133034	133098	133099	133099	I	0	” Vivian ’s cheeks pinked at the double meaning . The priest cleared his throat , interrupting our whispered conversation . We exchanged a last secret smile before we turned our full attention to the ceremony . Priest ’s remarks , vows , ring exchange . The pounding of my heart muffled sound and motion until we reached the end of the ceremony . “
133110	133160	133107	133107	You	2849	” I swept Vivian into my arms and kissed her before the priest finished his sentence . The crowd erupted into cheers and whistles . I barely heard them . I was too busy with my wife . Wife . The word sent an electric thrill down my spine . “
133165	133182	133107	133107	You	2849	” Vivian teased when we broke apart . Her face was flushed with pleasure and laughter . “

133212	133217	133273	133273	VIVIAN	258	” Another wicked grin . “
133225	133272	133273	133273	VIVIAN	258	” Pink blossomed anew across her face and chest . My grin widened . I ’d never get tired of making her smile and blush . She was my wife , my partner , my guiding star . And I would n’t have it any other way .
133274	133286	133287	133287	Isabella	178	“ My baby is married . They grow up so fast . ”
133294	133317	133287	133287	Isabella	178	“ I still remember when you were an innocent twenty - two - year - old , navigating the jungle of New — ”
