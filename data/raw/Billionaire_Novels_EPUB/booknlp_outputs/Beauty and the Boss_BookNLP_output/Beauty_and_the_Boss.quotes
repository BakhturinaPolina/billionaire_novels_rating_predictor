1394	1413	1414	1414	He	32	“ Can you send some dinner down for me now ? Mr. Forbes should be here any minute . ”

2155	2193	2194	2194	Carl	39	“ Hey , I was just watching out the window , checking to see if I could spot that ugly old yellow Jag of yours coming down the road yet . You ’re late , old man . ”
2197	2213	2194	2194	Carl	39	“ You would n’t recognize beauty if it punched you in the face , son . ”
2261	2269	2249	2249	He	32	“ I beg to differ , sir . ”
2270	2312	2313	2313	He	32	“ Well , regardless , you wo n’t be seeing it . I have to cancel . My knee ’s giving me trouble , and it ’s supposed to be icy tonight . The old lady wo n’t let me leave . ”

2611	2618	2605	2605	He	32	“ I ’ll tell her myself . ”
2634	2649	2623	2623	his	37	“ Very well , sir . I ’ll see you when you come up . ”
2650	2653	2654	2654	Benjamin	32	“ Thanks , ”
2679	2692	2654	2654	Benjamin	32	“ Do n’t wait up . It ’ll be another late night . ”
2693	2699	2705	2705	he	32	“ Very well , sir . ”

3250	3254	3255	3255	He	32	“ I know . ”
3319	3328	3329	3329	She	30	“ I was wondering if you were hungry ? ”
3342	3359	3329	3329	She	30	“ I packed dinner . I just have n’t gotten around to heating it up yet . ”
3360	3373	3374	3374	He	32	“ Oh . Well , my dinner plans were canceled last minute . ”
3380	3407	3374	3374	He	32	“ If you ’d rather , I have fresh eggplant parmesan and wine , and it ’s still hot — if that ’s agreeable to you . ”
3408	3411	3374	3374	He	32	“ Agreeable ? ”
3425	3431	3421	3421	He	32	“ Dinner . With me . ”
3432	3435	3374	3374	He	32	“ Umm … ”
3463	3482	3483	3483	He	32	“ Let me get this straight . You ’re inviting me to dinner ? With you ? Alone ? ”
3488	3498	3483	3483	He	32	“ I just said that , did n’t I ? ”
3499	3502	3503	3503	She	30	“ Uh . ”
3518	3538	3503	3503	She	30	“ Yeah , I guess so . Are you sure ? I mean , you ’re the boss and — ”
3539	3555	3556	3556	He	32	“ You ’re a great employee . I thought you might like to eat dinner . ”
3562	3569	3556	3556	He	32	“ That ’s all , Maggie . ”
3600	3610	3611	3611	His	32	“ I mean , yeah , I like food . ”
3615	3618	3611	3611	His	32	“ Good . ”
3619	3622	3623	3623	She	30	“ Yeah . ”
3628	3633	3623	3623	She	30	“ Uh , good . ”
3701	3722	3734	3734	she	30	“ If it makes you uncomfortable , please do n’t hesitate to say no . I wo n’t be insulted . ”
3723	3733	3734	3734	she	30	“ It does n’t make me uncomfortable at all , ”
3776	3815	3773	3773	her	30	“ I just did n’t want to create the wrong impression , is all . I mean , we ’re alone , and if we ’re eating , if might look like a … well , you know . ”
3816	3820	3848	3848	her	30	“ A date ? ”
3821	3826	3827	3827	She	30	“ Yes . That . ”
3861	3869	3870	3870	He	32	“ People might get the wrong idea . ”
3880	3890	3870	3870	He	32	“ Yes , clearly gossip would be an issue . ”
3891	3894	3895	3895	She	30	“ Okay . ”
3912	3923	3903	3903	her	30	“ You got me there . Eggplant parm , huh ? ”
3924	3927	3928	3928	He	32	“ Yep . ”
3938	3950	3928	3928	He	32	“ And wine , too , if you ’re feeling adventurous . ”
3951	3961	3962	3962	she	30	“ I ’m not done with the report yet , ”
3983	3995	3962	3962	she	30	“ I ’ll have to return to work after I eat . ”
3996	4000	4001	4001	She	30	“ Leave it . ”
4004	4007	4001	4001	She	30	“ But — ”
4008	4015	4016	4016	He	32	“ I said , leave it . ”
4079	4086	4087	4087	he	32	“ It ’ll wait till Monday , ”
4090	4107	4108	4108	she	30	“ Maybe I can take it home with me and work on it over the weekend , ”
4125	4137	4108	4108	she	30	“ It ’s not my style to just leave things undone . ”
4138	4142	4143	4143	He	32	“ Mine either . ”
4223	4233	4234	4234	She	30	“ So let ’s be rebellious together , Maggie . ”
4248	4262	4234	4234	She	30	“ Okay . Sure . Why not ? Pour the wine , sir . ”
4263	4282	4283	4283	he	32	“ I like a woman who can see the merits of letting loose every once in a while , ”
4300	4309	4286	4286	She	30	“ I do n’t let loose very often . ”
4310	4317	4318	4318	He	32	“ I doubt that ’s true . ”
4323	4337	4318	4318	He	32	“ Surely when you ’re at home , with your boyfriend , you — ”
4347	4375	4338	4338	She	30	“ I ’ll stop you right there . There ’s no boyfriend at home . As lame as it might sound , there ’s just a cat . ”
4405	4413	4400	4400	you	30	“ I do n’t even have that . ”
4414	4418	4419	4419	She	30	“ The boyfriend ? ”
4427	4432	4419	4419	She	30	“ Or the cat ? ”
4433	4437	4438	4438	He	32	“ Either one . ”
4444	4458	4459	4459	She	30	“ Tell me , how long ago did you move to New York ? ”
4469	4480	4461	4461	her	30	“ Is it that obvious I ’m not a native ? ”
4481	4484	4485	4485	He	32	“ Yeah . ”
4491	4494	4485	4485	He	32	“ Sorry . ”
4515	4531	4503	4503	Her	30	“ No apologies needed . I ’m sure I stick out like a sore thumb . ”
4532	4543	4544	4544	He	32	“ You ’re very polite and you apologize too much . ”
4557	4567	4544	4544	He	32	“ But that ’s not necessarily a bad thing . ”
4589	4597	4586	4586	she	30	“ He says with an apologetic tone … ”
4612	4621	4603	4603	he	32	“ Did you seriously just narrate our conversation ? ”
4622	4627	4628	4628	She	30	“ Um , maybe ? ”
4631	4645	4628	4628	She	30	“ I talk to myself a lot . It ’s a bad habit . ”
4728	4732	4726	4726	Gale	32	“ You do ? ”
4733	4743	4749	4749	her	30	“ I just said so , did n’t I ? ”
4855	4875	4840	4840	he	32	“ I do n’t willingly say this about a lot of people , but I like you , Maggie . ”
4881	4886	4876	4876	She	228	“ Uh — why ? ”
4887	4898	4899	4899	He	32	“ For starters , you ’re not afraid of me . ”
4917	4922	4923	4923	She	228	“ It ’s refreshing . ”
4934	4942	4925	4925	her	228	“ What ’s to be afraid of ? ”
4943	4954	4955	4955	She	228	“ I guess it ’s because I ’m a beast . ”
4999	5006	4989	4989	she	228	“ So , you heard that ? ”
5011	5022	5007	5007	He	32	“ I also heard you defend me . Thank you . ”
5023	5028	5029	5029	She	228	“ Oh . That ? ”
5034	5064	5029	5029	She	228	“ That was nothing . It ’s ridiculous that they gave you that name in the first place . You being a strict boss does n’t make you scary . ”
5065	5071	5079	5079	her	228	“ If you say so . ”
5072	5076	5079	5079	her	228	“ I do . ”
5162	5172	5151	5151	he	32	“ And anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool . ”
5187	5198	5183	5183	he	32	“ So , uh , where are you from originally ? ”
5312	5319	5320	5320	She	228	“ A farm in South Dakota . ”
5331	5342	5320	5320	She	228	“ You ’re shocked people actually live there , right ? ”
5348	5357	5320	5320	She	228	“ Well , now that you mention it … ”
5358	5364	5365	5365	she	228	“ Oh , shut up , ”
5452	5455	5456	5456	She	228	“ Oh … ”
5467	5483	5461	5461	her	228	“ Oh crap . I ’m sorry , sir . So sorry . I forgot — ”
5490	5506	5484	5484	He	32	“ It ’s fine . Your fork might not agree , but I ’m good . ”
5511	5523	5529	5529	she	228	“ I ’m such a klutz , give me a second . ”
5563	5566	5567	5567	He	32	“ Oops . ”
5621	5650	5610	5610	She	228	“ This is n’t awkward at all , right ? I mean , I ’m just a girl , kneeling under a table at her boss ’s feet … ”
5658	5661	5610	5610	She	228	“ Maggie . ”
5740	5743	5735	5735	He	32	“ You — ”
5744	5747	5748	5748	she	228	“ I — ”
5751	5756	5748	5748	she	228	“ Am I interrupting ? ”
5771	5776	5777	5777	He	32	“ Not at all . ”
5820	5827	5809	5809	her	229	“ What are you doing here ? ”
5828	5868	5869	5869	He	32	“ William informed me you were working late , so I decided to stop in . I see that working does not mean the same thing to me as it does you . No big surprise , of course . ”
5907	5915	5898	5898	He	32	“ What a pleasant surprise , Mother . ”
5916	5919	5920	5920	Maggie	30	“ Moth — ”
5933	5936	5920	5920	Maggie	30	“ Ow . ”
5937	5942	5943	5943	She	118	“ Oh , Benjamin . ”
5966	5974	5951	5951	her	118	“ I ’ll just bet it is . ”
6133	6141	6105	6105	she	30	“ Mrs. Gale . This is n’t — ”
6142	6145	6146	6148	the older woman	249	“ Quiet , ”
6161	6169	6146	6148	the older woman	249	“ No one was speaking to you . ”
6406	6422	6423	6424	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Please tell me this ‘ dinner ’ is not being billed to the company , ”
6434	6457	6423	6424	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Last I checked , there is no clause in your contract that states the company must pay for your many dalliances . ”
6753	6764	6765	6765	he	44	“ This is n’t a ‘ dalliance ’ , Mother , ”
6768	6773	6765	6765	he	44	“ It ’s not . ”
6792	6798	6799	6799	He	44	“ It ’s so not . ”
6904	6913	6898	6899	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Sit down . No one excused you . ”
6955	6970	6947	6947	she	30	“ This really is n’t what it looks like , Mrs. Gale . I — ”
6971	6978	6979	6979	He	44	“ Do n’t bother , Maggie . ”
6982	6989	6979	6979	He	44	“ She wo n’t believe you . ”
6994	7003	6990	6991	Mrs. Gale	45	“ You ’re right . I wo n’t . ”
7009	7041	7004	7004	He	44	“ You ca n’t come in here and order my employees around . If Maggie wants to leave , she ’s allowed . She ’s not a prisoner in my office . ”
7046	7058	7042	7042	She	45	“ Great . Thank you . I ’ll be on my — ”
7059	7063	7064	7066	The other woman	273	“ Your employee ? ”
7079	7100	7064	7066	The other woman	273	“ Oh , that ’s just rich . You have one of your workers under your table doing … doing … ”
7108	7115	7116	7116	he	274	“ As we already told you , ”
7125	7134	7119	7119	his	274	“ It ’s not what it looked like . ”
7135	7150	7151	7152	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Oh , but it was . And there are rules against such things . ”
7160	7168	7154	7154	her	45	“ Get out . You ’re fired . ”
7271	7274	7268	7268	She	45	“ Right . ”
7275	7286	7287	7287	His	276	“ Do n’t even think about walking out of here . ”
7296	7300	7287	7287	His	276	“ Sit down . ”
7355	7366	7344	7346	an apologetic doctor	281	“ Sorry , but this will be cold and uncomfortable . ”
7391	7413	7381	7381	she	45	“ How dare you bring one of your paramours into the company as an employee . What would your father say ? ”
7450	7460	7440	7440	She	45	“ You know what ? You can take your — ”
7461	7467	7468	7468	He	283	“ Father would say nothing . ”
7487	7518	7468	7468	He	283	“ We were working and had a dinner break together . We were both fully clothed , and she just happened to be under the table . That ’s it . ”
7530	7595	7519	7520	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Oh , dear me . I did n’t realize that wine at a business meal was now standard . Shall we serve that all day long at the break station , instead of coffee and tea ? Perhaps throw in a few hard spirits , as well , to liven up the day ? Some leftover medication that did n’t pass FDA approval ? ”
7758	7820	7739	7740	The man	264	“ That ’s not the same thing . It ’s after seven , and we ’re both finishing up a twelve - hour day on a Friday . Since my original dinner meeting was canceled , I invited Maggie to join me before I go home — alone , I might add . Not that it ’s any of your business . ”
7821	7830	7831	7832	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Then why was she under the table ? ”
7853	7882	7834	7834	her	45	“ Let me guess . You were playing hide and seek . She seems to be of the age and intelligence level that she ’d enjoy such trivialities . ”
7886	7898	7899	7899	He	250	“ Excuse me . I graduated top of my class at — ”
7903	7914	7899	7899	He	250	“ She dropped a fork and was picking it up . ”
7915	7925	7926	7926	His	250	“ Ah , but no one will believe that . ”
7932	7950	7929	7929	her	118	“ Not once I tell the board the disgraceful behavior I witnessed . Interoffice relations are forbidden . ”
7951	7955	7956	7956	he	250	“ Not always , ”
8036	8072	8032	8033	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Well , unless the two of you were secretly dating before she came here , you do n’t have a leg to stand on . And you are well aware of it , too . ”
8106	8120	8121	8122	his mother	118	“ As I thought . She ’s fired , and that ’s that , ”
8131	8206	8121	8122	his mother	118	“ It ’s time you stopped messing around with loose women , and did your duty as heir and primary share holder of Gale Incorporated . I set you up on a date with a lovely woman last night , and you did n’t even show up , which is why I ’m here in the first place . Do you know how long it took for me to smooth the waters with Sheldon ? ”
8228	8253	8218	8218	He	250	“ No , and I do n’t give a damn , either . I told you not to set me up with his daughter , ”
8262	8290	8258	8258	his	250	“ That ’s on you . You ’re the one who refuses to give up on the idea of me marrying some snob you handpicked for me . ”
8291	8296	8297	8298	His mother	118	“ With good reason . ”
8303	8338	8297	8298	His mother	118	“ I do n’t give up once I ’ve decided on a course of action . It ’s a pity you did n’t inherit my determination to win and stubbornness to be the best . ”
8394	8411	8412	8412	he	250	“ Funny that you think that . You tried to kick me out of this position , ”
8419	8429	8412	8412	he	250	“ And yet here I stand . Holding steady . ”
8430	8439	8440	8440	She	118	“ This is not a conversation for outsiders . ”
8467	8476	8445	8445	her	118	“ Let her go . She ’s fired . ”
8483	8497	8480	8480	his	44	“ No , she ’s not . And she ’s not going anywhere . ”
8498	8515	8516	8516	She	118	“ Very well then . You want to dig yourself a deeper hole ? Go ahead . ”
8523	8532	8518	8518	her	118	“ I ’m through trying to protect you . ”
8533	8545	8480	8480	his	44	“ Protecting me ? When the hell have you ever — ? ”
8546	8549	8554	8554	her	118	“ Language , ”
8558	8637	8554	8554	her	118	“ You listen , and you listen well , young man . You will go on the dates I set up for you , and you will do it with a smile on your face , and you will pick one of them to become your wife . It ’s what your father did before you , and your father ’s father , and your father ’s father ’s father . It is what ’s expected of you . ”
8656	8781	8782	8782	She	303	“ You will be charming and every inch the gentleman I raised you to be . You will find a suitable woman to settle down with , and you will propose . Enough of these dalliances with low - class women — it ’s time to do your duty as heir and the head of this company . You wanted the position badly enough to fight me for it ? You have it . Now it ’s time to take full responsibility for that position . It ’s been almost six years . It ’s time to be the man you ’re supposed to be . A man your father might possibly be proud of . If not , I swear , I ’ll — ”
8831	8835	8836	8836	he	44	“ Go on , ”
8839	8851	8836	8836	he	44	“ Finish your threat . You ’ve never held back before . ”
8866	8916	8859	8859	her	45	“ If not , I ’ll take this unfortunate situation to the board and use it to get you kicked out of your tenuous position as CEO of this company . Your brother is three years younger than you , and he ’s married a woman of suitable upbringing — ”
8917	8924	8836	8836	he	44	“ That you picked for him . ”
8925	8934	8935	8935	she	45	“ Yes , that I picked for him , ”
8949	9010	8935	8935	she	45	“ And they ’re married , with two little boys to carry on the good Gale name , as they should . They attend charity balls . He ’s every bit the CEO this company needs . If it were left up to you , you ’d bring a lady of the night to the mayor ’s dinner next month . ”
9040	9048	9035	9035	Maggie	30	“ If you ’re insinuating I ’m — ”
9066	9074	9075	9075	She	30	“ I was n’t speaking to you . ”
9113	9156	9097	9097	his	44	“ I would n’t be the first to do so , and if you think otherwise , you ’re more naive than I ever imagined . Last week , Mr. Thorn brought a woman that I know for a fact is a — ”
9157	9161	9162	9162	She	30	“ Do n’t . ”
9203	9281	9282	9282	He	44	“ You will announce an engagement before the next board meeting , or I will put forth a motion to remove you as CEO under a No Confidence vote , and do everything in my power to instate Andrew into the position in your stead . Do n’t make the mistake of thinking I wo n’t get the votes needed . I will . I ’ve ensured as much . As I said , I abhor losing . ”
9374	9402	9366	9366	she	30	“ That ’s ridiculous , and this is the twenty - first century . You ca n’t force someone to get married because you want them to . ”
9462	9465	9490	9490	she	45	“ Maggie — ”
9466	9470	9471	9472	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Excuse me ? ”
9495	9517	9490	9490	she	45	“ Who exactly are you to speak on this matter ? And why are you still here ? I fired you . ”
9518	9534	9535	9536	Mr. Gale	44	“ Ah , but he did n’t . And there ’s a reason for that . ”
9557	9562	9553	9554	His mother	118	“ How dare you — ”
9563	9571	9572	9572	she	30	“ I ’m your son ’s fiancée , ”
9576	9636	9572	9572	she	30	“ We were together before I joined the company . That ’s why he ca n’t date other women , why he did n’t show up last night . And it makes all of your threats empty ones , too . You ca n’t fire me . So – yeah . He already wins , because he has me . ”
9797	9804	9791	9791	his	44	“ Maggie , you do n’t — ”
9805	9827	9828	9828	She	30	“ It ’s okay . I told you I did n’t want to announce it yet , but I ’m ready . ”
9846	9865	9833	9833	His	44	“ We can tell the whole world how much we love each other if you want … Benjamin . ”
9897	9901	9885	9885	he	44	“ Love — ? ”
10311	10314	10315	10316	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Enough , ”
10331	10363	10315	10316	Mrs. Gale	45	“ If you think I ’ll buy this … this … indecent sham as something real , you ’re even less fit as the head of this company than I suspected . ”
10419	10440	10406	10406	his	44	“ There ’s nothing indecent in this room . We love each other and are n’t ashamed to show it . ”
10441	10447	10406	10406	his	44	“ This is unacceptable . Whatever this”—she
10453	10505	10512	10512	she	30	Gale—“is , it needs to end . Now . I ’ll contact you with a list of suitable candidates , and you will woo them all . And you will pick one of them and kick her to the curb where she belongs … or you ’ll pay the ultimate price . ”
10632	10701	10629	10629	she	30	“ I ’m sorry . So , so sorry , Mr. Gale . I have no idea what came over me , but she kept yelling and calling you worthless , and you work so hard and do n’t deserve to be treated that way , and I just , I do n’t know , snapped . I could n’t take it anymore , so I … I … ”
10702	10708	10709	10709	he	167	“ Did the perfect thing , ”
10721	10727	10709	10709	he	167	“ Damn brilliant , really . ”
10728	10736	10737	10737	She	30	“ It was stupid and irresponsible and — ”
10758	10763	10737	10737	She	30	“ Wait . What ? ”
11130	11212	11127	11127	her	30	“ N - No . It was stupid . All she has to do is ask a few questions around the office , and she ’ll find out the truth . She ’ll fire me . I wo n’t be able to pay my rent , or help my parents out back home . I ’ll be disgraced , and no one will hire me . I ’ll have to leave the city and go back to milking cows and training — ”
11231	11234	11235	11235	He	353	“ Maggie . ”
11288	11297	11278	11278	She	354	“ It ’s okay . Everything ’s okay . ”
11303	11330	11278	11278	She	354	“ No , it ’s not . I messed up so bad , just like I always do , but this time it ’s at work . ”
11331	11348	11349	11349	He	353	“ But we do n’t have to tell anyone . No one needs to find out . ”
11414	11447	11448	11448	Her	354	“ We can make this into something real . Well , not real , but for the sake of everyone else it will look authentic . Like we were dating all along . ”
11701	11714	11688	11688	She	30	“ No one will believe it . We ’re never alone together . ”
11715	11721	11722	11722	He	353	“ Yeah , we are . ”
11764	11806	11750	11750	he	353	“ All the time . We always work later than everyone else , just like tonight . If we announce our engagement , people will all slap their thighs and go , ‘ That ’s why they always stayed late . ’ ”
11813	11822	11809	11809	her	30	“ It ca n’t possibly be that easy . ”
11823	11869	11870	11870	He	362	“ The hell it ca n’t . People are gullible . Show them what they expect to see , and they believe it . If we tell them we stayed behind late to hide our love from the world , they ’ll eat it up . ”
11886	11905	11906	11906	She	30	“ My mother will fall for it , too , since she already saw us on a date . ”
11909	11916	11906	11906	She	30	“ It was n’t a date . ”
11917	11927	11928	11928	He	362	“ I know that , and so do you . ”
11933	11939	11928	11928	He	362	“ But she does n’t . ”
11946	11966	11967	11967	she	30	“ Okay , fine . Whatever . But why would you want to pretend to be engaged to me ? ”
11979	11986	11967	11967	she	30	“ I do n’t get it . ”
11987	12003	12004	12004	he	362	“ You ’re the one who told her we were engaged in the first place , ”
12007	12011	12004	12004	he	362	“ Not me . ”
12012	12046	11967	11967	she	30	“ I know . And again , sorry . I ’m never impulsive like that . I have no idea what came over me . I guess I just wanted to help you . ”
12047	12069	12070	12070	He	362	“ I ’m not impulsive either , and I always think things through . To the point of exhaustion , even . ”
12077	12100	12070	12070	He	362	“ But I can see the merit of us pretending to be engaged , and you should be able to as well . ”
12110	12115	12101	12101	She	30	“ And that is ? ”
12116	12154	12155	12155	She	30	“ Well , for starters , you could be fired if she went to the board with what she ‘ saw ’ here tonight — and she does have that power , if she can convince them . ”
12158	12162	12155	12155	She	30	“ She does ? ”
12163	12198	12199	12199	He	362	“ Yes . It ’s against company policy , so we could both be punished . It would help her force me out as CEO , and you would be fired on the spot . ”
12204	12244	12199	12199	He	362	“ But with your smart lie , we would n’t have to worry about it . If we act as if we ’re in love , and have been for a long time , we ’ll both be safe . ”
12245	12265	12266	12266	She	30	“ That ’s great and all , but we ’ll have to convince people we ’re in a relationship . ”
12275	12282	12266	12266	She	30	“ How do we do that ? ”
12322	12357	12358	12358	He	362	“ We act happy , just like regular couples do . Kiss . Smile . Date . Instagram how in love we both are , and how we ca n’t wait to get married . ”
12361	12383	12358	12358	He	362	“ And then , after a suitable amount of time , we break up and continue on as we have been . ”
12389	12408	12386	12386	her	30	“ But we have to pretend to be in love ? That ’s crazy . Is n’t it ? ”
12409	12415	12416	12416	He	362	“ Maybe . Maybe not . ”
12426	12456	12416	12416	He	362	“ Either way , I think it ’s our best option . This way , you keep your job and I keep mine . No cow - milking necessary . ”
12463	12476	12416	12416	He	362	“ But we ’d have to actually , you know , date . ”
12477	12480	12416	12416	He	362	“ Yeah . ”
12484	12487	12416	12416	He	362	“ And ? ”
12488	12498	12499	12499	she	30	“ And … and you know nothing about me , ”
12506	12511	12499	12499	she	30	“ Nothing at all . ”
12512	12539	12540	12540	She	30	“ That ’s not true . Remember when we worked on the Collins project for a week , and on Friday , it all fell apart ? ”
12545	12548	12540	12540	She	30	“ Yeah . ”
12549	12576	12577	12577	He	362	“ We thought it was hopeless , that we ’d end up failing the client because we did n’t have the numbers or the presentation ready . ”
12597	12625	12591	12591	She	30	“ We worked all throughout the weekend , only breaking for sleep , but we ended up giving them the best damn presentation we ’ve ever given . ”
12626	12640	12591	12591	She	30	“ You ’re saying this to prove we work well together , right ? ”
12641	12644	12645	12645	He	362	“ Yep . ”
12677	12691	12665	12665	he	362	“ And there ’s no way in hell you can argue with that . ”
12692	12711	12665	12665	he	362	“ You ’re right . I ca n’t . But you still know next to nothing about me . ”
12712	12730	12731	12731	He	362	“ Sure I do . You ’re kind , smart , and think fast on your feet . ”
12734	12779	12780	12780	He	362	“ I can count on you to get a job done , and you ’re a loyal employee . If that ’s not enough for me to decide we make a good team , there ’s the fact that I enjoy working with you . ”
13006	13029	13070	13070	He	362	“ But we have next to nothing in common . Your family is as different from mine as night is from day . ”
13030	13069	13070	13070	He	362	“ Night and day are n’t that different , when you think about it . Both are ruled by a bright , round object in the sky . And both end in order for the other to begin . ”
13111	13132	13096	13096	she	364	“ It ’s all about teamwork . And I , for one , think we ’d make an excellent team . ”
13133	13136	13137	13137	She	364	“ But — ”
13156	13162	13139	13139	her	364	“ Sorry . So sorry . ”
13214	13220	13221	13221	he	362	“ I ’ll pay you , ”
13225	13230	13221	13221	he	362	“ Twenty thousand dollars . ”
13231	13235	13236	13236	She	364	“ Wha — ? ”
13247	13250	13251	13251	She	364	“ Thirty . ”
13381	13383	13396	13396	her	364	“ love ”
13415	13437	13438	13438	she	364	“ I can’t – won’t — take money from you to continue a lie that I initiated in the first place , ”
13449	13458	13438	13438	she	364	“ You insult me by insinuating I would . ”
13484	13487	13471	13471	He	362	“ But — ”
13488	13491	13492	13492	She	364	“ No . ”
13498	13502	13494	13494	her	364	“ Absolutely not . ”
13560	13573	13548	13548	He	362	“ What will it take to get you to agree , then ? ”
13574	13578	13579	13579	she	364	“ Not money , ”
13586	13593	13579	13579	she	364	“ You ca n’t buy me . ”
13600	13641	13579	13579	she	364	“ Okay , I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to … I ’m used to … Most people would n’t turn down money . Actually , most people would have asked for more before ‘ reluctantly ’ agreeing . ”
13642	13653	13654	13654	She	364	“ Then you obviously hang out with the wrong people . ”
13659	13666	13654	13654	She	364	“ And that ’s just sad . ”
13704	13719	13694	13694	he	362	“ I said this before , but we make a good team , Maggie . ”
13720	13724	13725	13725	she	364	“ We do , ”
13729	13759	13725	13725	she	364	“ That ’s exactly what I ’m scared of , because I do n’t want to mess that up , like I inevitably would . Pretending to love someone — ”
13768	13771	13766	13766	she	364	“ messing up ”
13780	13793	13766	13766	she	364	“ Let me guess . You and love do n’t get along ? ”
13797	13800	13794	13794	She	364	“ No . ”
13801	13855	13856	13856	He	376	“ Well , I would n’t recognize love if cupid shot me with a heart - tipped arrow straight through the chest . So we ’re the perfect match . Neither of us will get attached , because we both have no interest in doing so , therefore no one will get hurt . ”
13869	13879	13856	13856	He	376	“ Please do this for me ? For us ? ”
14015	14018	14019	14019	She	364	“ Maggie . ”
14034	14038	14019	14019	She	364	“ Mr. Gale — ”
14039	14042	14043	14043	He	376	“ Benjamin . ”
14089	14094	14078	14078	she	364	“ Call me Benjamin . ”
14095	14123	14128	14128	she	364	“ Benjamin … if we do this , it has to be a business arrangement . It has to be clear - cut and easy . Pretend . ”
14136	14156	14128	14128	she	364	“ If we do n’t keep everything fake — it ’ll blow up in our faces . Trust me . ”
14194	14219	14220	14220	She	364	“ Deal . But we need to be comfortable with one another , too . To sell the whole ‘ in love ’ thing . ”
14223	14228	14220	14220	She	364	“ R - Right . ”
14229	14236	14237	14237	He	376	“ So little kisses like this … ”
14299	14311	14312	14312	She	364	“ They have to come as easy to us as breathing . ”
14317	14321	14312	14312	She	364	“ Mr. Gale . ”
14322	14325	14326	14326	He	376	“ Maggie . ”
14373	14381	14366	14366	he	376	“ You have to call me Benjamin . ”
14382	14385	14399	14399	his	376	“ Benjamin . ”
14386	14391	14392	14392	He	376	“ There you go . ”
14405	14415	14399	14399	his	376	“ That ’s not so hard , is it ? ”
14421	14430	14416	14416	Her	364	“ I do n’t know . Is it ? ”
14485	14508	14534	14534	his	376	“ I ’ll be honest , I ’ve thought of doing this before . Touching you . And now here we are . ”
14509	14512	14513	14513	She	364	“ Yeah . ”
14519	14524	14515	14515	her	364	“ Here we are . ”
14525	14531	14532	14532	He	376	“ What do you think ? ”
14575	14585	14562	14562	He	376	“ Can we make this thing between us work ? ”
14586	14618	14562	14562	He	376	“ If we ’re being honest , I definitely feel the attraction , too . That ’s why if we get caught up in the lie , it would be catastrophic . ”
14664	14674	14675	14675	She	364	“ But it could be really good , too . ”
14688	14698	14675	14675	She	364	“ If we do this , we should n’t be doing”—she
14701	14703	14675	14675	She	364	them—“this . ”
14724	14782	14719	14719	she	364	“ I ’m fine with that , if that ’s what you want . I ’ll never force you to do anything you do n’t want to do . You can walk out of here , tell me to go to hell , and I ’ll still fight for your job till I ca n’t fight anymore . ”
14797	14804	14783	14783	He	376	“ Do you want to leave ? ”
14820	14823	14807	14807	her	364	“ No . ”
14824	14828	14807	14807	her	364	“ All right . ”
14833	14872	14829	14829	His	376	“ So , back on topic , if we ’re going to do this , we ’ll have to kiss fairly often , to make it real . We ’ll have to be comfortable enough with one another … ”
14894	14903	14873	14873	He	376	“ To do things like this without hesitation . ”
14940	14949	14950	14950	He	376	“ All the time . Try it again . ”
14961	14965	14950	14950	He	376	“ Like that ? ”
14966	14970	14971	14971	Her	364	“ Mm hmm . ”

14999	15009	14991	14991	He	376	“ Do I sense a ‘ but ’ coming ? ”
15010	15017	15018	15018	Her	364	“ But I ’ll do it . ”

15201	15213	15214	15214	He	376	“ You do n’t have to sell me on the idea . ”
15240	15255	15230	15230	She	364	“ You want me to kiss you ? I ’ll damn well kiss you . ”

15388	15394	15369	15369	she	364	“ Was that too much ? ”
15423	15428	15437	15437	his	376	“ Um , maybe … ”
15429	15434	15435	15435	He	376	“ I ’m sorry . ”

16092	16103	16086	16086	She	364	“ I never … I mean … Oh my God . ”
16164	16167	16168	16168	She	364	“ Maggie … ”

16265	16273	16274	16274	She	364	“ We should discuss rules and plans . ”
16315	16332	16305	16305	she	364	“ Yes , we should , but not now . I - I need to go . ”
16333	16336	16338	16338	he	376	“ Okay . ”
16380	16395	16396	16396	She	364	“ Meet me for dinner tomorrow ? So we can discuss everything in detail ? ”
16402	16405	16396	16396	She	364	“ Where ? ”

17073	17079	17068	17068	she	30	“ What were you thinking ? ”
17401	17407	17381	17381	She	30	“ Oh , come on . ”
17415	17420	17381	17381	She	30	“ There a problem ? ”
17421	17428	17436	17436	she	30	“ No . It ’s nothing . ”
17515	17518	17519	17519	she	30	“ Wait ! ”
17570	17609	17563	17563	God	52	“ Come on , Maggie . You can do this . You ’re not cursed , and it ’s not an omen . Go in there , and it ’ll be fine . It ’s just another job . ”
17610	17619	17690	17690	He	423	“ You were n’t kidding , were you ? ”
17626	17635	17690	17690	He	423	“ You really do like talking to yourself . ”
17675	17678	17690	17690	He	423	“ Sir ? ”

17819	17824	17779	17779	his	423	“ I ’m glad . ”
17833	17906	17827	17827	he	423	“ In this relationship , you ’re the boss , not me . It ’s only fair , since I ’m the boss in the office . What you want , you get . What you do n’t want , you do n’t get . I want you to be one hundred percent happy . I do n’t want you to feel trapped , or taken advantage of . Not with me . ”
17996	18008	17991	17991	he	423	“ You look gorgeous , by the way . Simply stunning . ”
18052	18070	18045	18045	he	423	“ You ’re a true beauty . The kind that no amount of makeup will ever recreate . ”
18080	18091	18071	18071	Her	30	“ I feel like Belle from Beauty and the Beast . ”
18092	18096	18097	18097	He	423	“ How fitting . ”
18102	18111	18099	18099	his	423	“ I guess that makes me the Beast ? ”
18112	18118	18119	18119	He	423	“ If the shoe fits … ”
18164	18170	18158	18158	she	30	“ Oh , it fits . ”
18208	18211	18204	18204	he	423	“ Benjamin . ”
18246	18262	18276	18276	his	423	“ Another rule : You should save the intimate touching for when people are watching . ”
18263	18271	18272	18272	he	423	“ There are tons of people outside , ”
18283	18289	18272	18272	he	423	“ Does n’t that count ? ”
18300	18303	18276	18276	his	423	“ No . ”
18304	18308	18309	18309	He	423	“ All right . ”
18323	18347	18309	18309	He	423	“ Like I said , you ’re the boss . If you want me to keep my hands to myself , I will . ”
18419	18423	18401	18401	She	30	“ I do . ”
18424	18428	18429	18429	He	423	“ All right . ”
18446	18466	18431	18431	his	423	“ Ready to go inside ? Or do you need to continue your little pep talk to yourself first ? ”
18467	18475	18476	18476	she	30	“ I ’m good , thank you , ”
18495	18507	18508	18508	She	30	“ I ’d just finished when you came up to me . ”
18570	18586	18557	18557	He	423	“ I find it charming , you know . The way you talk to yourself . ”
18614	18617	18618	18618	They	429	“ Thanks . ”
18728	18731	18711	18711	He	423	“ Maggie ? ”
18732	18735	18736	18736	She	30	“ Uh — ”
18739	18747	18736	18736	She	30	“ Is this whole room for us ? ”
18748	18751	18752	18752	His	423	“ Yes . ”
18781	18816	18763	18763	he	423	“ I do n’t want anyone overhearing our conversation . I would n’t put it past my mother to have spies following us , to see if we ’re the real thing or not . ”
18817	18822	18757	18757	he	423	“ Oh . Right . ”
18845	18867	18838	18838	he	423	“ Thanks . After the day I ’ve had , I ca n’t wait to get an appletini . Or five . ”
18910	18939	18884	18884	He	423	“ No need to wait for a drink . I pre - ordered our wine to go with our meal . This is their best bottle of white . ”
19027	19034	19039	19039	He	423	“ Uh … thanks . Sure . ”
19035	19038	19039	19039	He	423	“ Oh . ”
19063	19071	19072	19072	He	423	“ Also , some flowers for you . ”
19100	19103	19104	19104	She	30	“ Thanks . ”
19112	19131	19104	19104	She	30	“ What else do you have under there ? A waiter ? A string quartet with a violin ? ”
19152	19161	19144	19144	he	423	“ No , they ’ll come in later . ”
19162	19165	19170	19170	his	423	“ Seriously ? ”
19173	19176	19170	19170	his	423	“ No . ”
19177	19181	19182	19182	she	30	“ Thank God , ”
19187	19189	19144	19144	he	423	“ date ”
19341	19347	19337	19337	She	30	“ Pretty flowers . Thanks . ”
19348	19353	19354	19354	She	30	“ You ’re welcome . ”
19574	19579	19580	19580	he	423	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
19590	19593	19580	19580	he	423	“ Nothing . ”
19619	19625	19594	19594	She	30	“ Why do you ask ? ”
19626	19632	19636	19636	she	30	“ You ’re acting strange . ”
19655	19680	19681	19681	He	423	“ Lucky for you , this date is all for show , and you do n’t need to worry about what I ’m thinking . ”
19953	19961	19935	19935	She	30	“ When will they bring the menus ? ”
19962	19971	19972	19972	he	449	“ I already ordered us both their finest , ”
20007	20021	20004	20004	he	449	“ They ’ll bring the courses in when we ’re ready for them . ”
20037	20040	20041	20041	she	30	“ Excellent , ”
20045	20057	20041	20041	she	30	“ Ca n’t wait to see what I ’m eating tonight . ”
20067	20072	20058	20058	He	449	“ You ’re displeased . ”
20073	20091	20092	20092	She	30	“ No . It ’s just that this is n’t going exactly how I expected it would . ”
20102	20108	20109	20109	He	449	“ More wine , please ? ”
20275	20281	20282	20282	she	30	“ Mm . Good bread , ”
20294	20314	20282	20282	she	30	“ You should try some . Do n’t worry , I wo n’t throw it at you this time . ”
20339	20345	20329	20329	he	32	“ What ’s going on ? ”
20362	20365	20366	20366	She	30	“ Nothing . ”
20388	20395	20396	20396	He	32	“ I already told you that . ”
20491	20529	20476	20476	he	32	“ You might think you ’re good at pretending you ’re all right , but I can read you like an open book , so I see you ’re not happy . Tell me what ’s wrong . ”
20530	20536	20537	20537	she	30	“ Why do you care ? ”
20541	20549	20537	20537	she	30	“ What ’s it matter to you ? ”
20550	20560	20561	20561	he	32	“ I did n’t exactly say I did care , ”
20568	20599	20561	20561	he	32	“ I just said I could see it . But regardless of what you seem to think , I want you to enjoy yourself . I ’m not that cruel . ”
20604	20616	20561	20561	he	32	“ I am . Like I said , I ’m fine . ”
20617	20624	20625	20625	He	32	“ Good . In that case … ”
20638	20645	20625	20625	He	32	“ I picked this up today . ”
20679	20692	20667	20667	he	32	“ Please tell me that ’s not what I think it is . ”
20693	20699	20700	20700	He	32	“ It ’s a ring . ”
20710	20728	20700	20700	He	32	“ If that ’s what you think it is , then , yes , you ’re correct . ”
20879	20895	20853	20853	she	30	“ A fake engagement does n’t qualify for a real ring . Take it back . ”
20896	20899	20900	20900	He	32	“ Actually … ”
20915	20931	20900	20900	He	32	“ It does . My mother will notice if you ’re wearing a fake rock . ”
20932	20938	20939	20939	He	32	“ You ca n’t tell . ”
20956	20965	20950	20950	He	32	“ Oh , fine . Maybe she can . ”
20983	20996	20966	20966	Maggie	30	“ But that does n’t mean I need a gaudy , huge — ”
21096	21101	21102	21102	he	32	“ You were saying ? ”
21156	21178	21146	21146	He	32	“ I was n’t sure about your size , so I made an educated guess with the help of the salesperson . ”
21179	21186	21146	21146	He	32	“ What did you tell her ? ”
21187	21194	21195	21195	His	32	“ Your height and approximate weight . ”
21203	21225	21195	21195	His	32	“ Do n’t ask me to tell you what I told her . I know a trap when I see one . ”
21268	21279	21253	21253	His	32	“ You must ’ve done pretty well . It fits . ”
21280	21283	21284	21284	He	32	“ Good . ”
21365	21372	21373	21373	She	30	“ It looks good on you . ”
21392	21412	21389	21389	It	465	“ Thanks . I … I love it . But I ’ll give it back after this is over . ”
21413	21422	21423	21423	He	32	“ Keep it . Sell it . Whatever . ”
21474	21486	21459	21459	She	30	“ No way . It had to have cost a fortune . ”
21487	21504	21519	21519	He	32	“ To be honest , I have no clue . I just handed her my card . ”
21505	21511	21512	21512	She	30	“ You just handed her — ”
21551	21558	21559	21559	He	32	“ I mean … I see . ”
21569	21575	21561	21561	his	32	“ You ’re disappointed again . ”
21576	21588	21589	21589	He	32	“ No . I ’m just realizing how different we are . ”
21610	21618	21591	21591	his	32	“ And that ’s a bad thing ? ”
21621	21656	21657	21657	He	32	“ No . But , I mean , this dress ? It ’s not something I normally wear . I ’m like a kid playing dress up , while you probably sleep in suits . ”
21678	21685	21686	21686	She	30	“ Actually , I sleep naked . ”
21723	21749	21710	21710	He	32	“ And as far as clothes go , we can buy you a new wardrobe . And lots of jewelry to go with that ring . ”
21760	21772	21710	21710	He	32	“ You — I — you should n’t have said that . ”
21773	21780	21781	21781	He	32	“ And yet , I did . ”
21791	21866	21781	21781	He	32	“ Back on topic , before you complain or say it ’s too much , hear me out . I have lots of events to attend , and , as my fiancée , you ’ll be expected to be by my side . So there will be a need for dresses , and diamonds , and whatnot . Anything you need , you can just swipe my card , and it ’ll be yours . ”
21888	21897	21877	21877	she	30	“ What do you mean ? What events ? ”
21898	21937	21938	21938	He	32	“ Let ’s see … there ’s the mayor ’s ball next Friday , and Saturday there ’s a gala at Rockefeller Center . Sunday ’s a matinee at the Richard Rodgers Theatre to benefit kids with cancer . ”
21945	21986	21938	21938	He	32	“ So this week alone , you ’ll need three dresses , and accessories , too . Do n’t skimp on the jewelry . No one will expect you to wear the same thing twice . It ’s unheard of . ”
22027	22030	22058	22059	The waiter	449	“ I – ”
22031	22057	22058	22059	The waiter	449	“ Do you speak French ? Next week we have an event with the French Ambassador , and it would be awesome if you could — ”
22140	22147	22135	22135	Benjamin	32	“ What ? What is it ? ”
22148	22153	22154	22154	She	30	“ I … I — ”
22163	22170	22154	22154	She	30	“ I ca n’t do this . ”
22171	22176	22135	22135	Benjamin	32	“ Maggie , wait ! ”
22384	22399	22378	22378	she	30	“ I ca n’t . I ca n’t do it . I ca n’t — ”
22400	22403	22404	22404	She	30	“ Shh . ”
22416	22419	22408	22408	she	30	“ Benjamin ? ”
22501	22511	22512	22512	She	30	“ Take a deep breath . In . Out . ”
22531	22546	22512	22512	She	30	“ There you go . That ’s it . Now , slower this time . ”
22584	22591	22569	22569	her	30	“ Good . Easy , now . ”
22635	22665	22616	22616	He	32	“ I ’m sorry . I just … I’m allergic to shellfish . And when it was all there , in front of me , I could n’t breathe . ”
22666	22669	22672	22672	He	32	“ Oh . ”
22764	22774	22775	22775	She	30	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t think . ”
22781	22802	22775	22775	She	30	“ You would n’t have . I mean , you did n’t ask me , so how could you have ? ”
22845	22859	22836	22837	No one	114	“ You wanted to be asked . That ’s what you ’re saying . ”
22860	22865	22866	22866	She	30	“ Well , yeah . ”
22877	22905	22866	22866	She	30	“ Of course I did . I ’m not some empty - headed bimbo who ca n’t order for herself what she wants to eat or drink . ”
23049	23073	23074	23074	She	30	“ Of course you ’re not . How stupid of me to treat you the way I did . Can you forgive me ? ”
23077	23080	23074	23074	She	30	“ Benjamin … ”
23081	23085	23086	23086	he	32	“ I know , ”
23146	23158	23159	23159	She	30	“ I ’m sorry . Next time , I ’ll ask . ”
23164	23214	23161	23161	her	30	“ This … we … you want us to pretend to be in love , but how can we do that if we literally know nothing about each other ? What would your mother say if she found out you ordered your fiancée a meal that would kill her ? ”
23230	23255	23218	23218	she	30	“ So , that ’s why you left the restaurant ? The lobster ? Not because you did n’t want to be my fiancée ? ”
23256	23263	23264	23264	She	30	“ No . God , no . ”
23272	23283	23264	23264	She	30	“ I do n’t want to do that , either . ”
23284	23289	23290	23290	He	482	“ Good , because — ”
23315	23335	23310	23310	he	482	“ Wait , what do you mean ? You said you ’d go through with it . You promised . ”
23336	23368	23369	23369	She	30	“ That was before . Look , we ’re simply not a match . Fake or real , we ’d never work . I ’ll never be able to sell this . ”
23377	23425	23369	23369	She	30	“ Sure , you ’re a good kisser , and you have a great knee , but that would n’t be enough to make me love you , let alone marry you , in real life . And anyone who knows me would call me on it . ”
23426	23441	23442	23442	He	484	“ We only need to convince people in my life , really , and — ”
23462	23478	23447	23447	She	30	“ I have a great knee ? What the hell is that supposed to mean ? ”
23479	23482	23483	23483	she	30	“ Nothing , ”
23486	23511	23483	23483	she	30	“ But I do n’t like this whole alpha male thing you do . It would drive me insane in less than a week . ”
23525	23534	23521	23522	this woman	308	“ What alpha thing do I have going ? ”
23535	23578	23579	23579	She	30	“ You take women on dates , and throw your money at them to get them into your bed , and woo them with generic roses . I ’m sure it works . I ’m sure they all throw themselves at you . ”
23591	23628	23588	23588	her	30	“ But I ’m not them , and the waste , and the utter thoughtlessness behind the gestures … it ’s all empty . I ca n’t do it , not even to save my job . ”
23635	23660	23629	23629	He	486	“ I take my dates to nice restaurants , order the best food and wine , and give them roses . Is that wrong ? ”
23661	23678	23679	23679	She	30	“ No . But it ’s not me . And everyone who knows me knows that . ”
23716	23777	23808	23808	her	30	“ Look , I want to help you . I do . But I ca n’t pretend to be something I ’m not . I do n’t speak French , and I do n’t want to buy a ton of diamonds , or eat with the French Ambassador , or the mayor . I did n’t even vote for him . ”
23778	23783	23784	23784	He	486	“ That ’s okay . ”
23789	23799	23786	23786	his	486	“ I did n’t vote for him , either . ”
23850	23869	23889	23889	he	486	“ Okay , but still . I do n’t want money and credit cards and all the things . ”
23870	23888	23889	23889	he	486	“ I ’m going to be honest . You confuse the hell out of me , Maggie , ”
23902	23925	23889	23889	he	486	“ Most women I ’ve dated would be pleased to get a credit card for unlimited spending , and jewels , too . ”
23935	23946	23947	23947	He	486	“ Yeah , well , I ’m not most women . ”
23975	23982	23949	23949	his	486	“ I ’m getting that now . ”
23983	24004	24005	24005	Maggie	30	“ You want a puppet you can dangle in front of your mother , who fits in with your crowd . ”
24023	24075	24076	24076	He	486	“ And I ’m not that girl . I ’ve never been good at fitting in , or falling into line , so chances are I ’m not about to start now . Not even to keep my job , which I happen to enjoy a lot , for the record . ”
24092	24105	24084	24084	he	486	“ Maggie , I ’m sorry I screwed up . I am . ”
24113	24147	24084	24084	he	486	“ Like I said , you ’re in charge . But I did n’t know I was doing anything wrong . I just did what I always do when I take women out . ”
24148	24160	24161	24161	He	486	“ You always give women Tiffany rings on the first date ? ”
24164	24167	24161	24161	He	486	“ No . ”
24168	24173	24174	24174	He	486	“ And credit cards ? ”
24180	24203	24174	24174	He	486	“ You ’ve made your point . It was too much , too fast . I wo n’t make that mistake again . ”
24216	24236	24209	24209	she	30	“ You think I ’m a girl who ’s impressed with money , and jewels , and fancy restaurants . ”
24237	24243	24244	24244	He	486	“ But you ’re not . ”
24282	24337	24338	24338	She	30	“ Please , let me try again . And if you do n’t want to buy yourself diamonds … don’t buy diamonds . If you want to wear a plastic bag to the galas , go for it . I do n’t give a damn , as long as you ’re there with me . ”
24343	24350	24340	24340	her	30	“ But what will everyone think ? ”
24351	24358	24359	24359	He	486	“ Whatever they want to think . ”
24366	24372	24359	24359	He	486	“ Who the hell cares ? ”
24382	24390	24373	24373	She	30	“ You do , I ’d say . ”
24391	24394	24395	24395	He	486	“ Nah . ”
24440	24468	24469	24469	She	30	“ I do n’t . I ’m kind of a loner , so if they do n’t like me … I really do n’t give a damn . ”
24533	24542	24543	24543	He	486	“ Tell you what . How about this ? ”
24568	24599	24600	24600	She	30	“ You pick the next ‘ date . ’ Show me what you like to do , so I ’ll know what to plan when it ’s my turn again . ”
24620	24623	24614	24614	she	30	“ When ? ”
24624	24634	24635	24635	He	486	“ Whenever , and wherever , you ’d like . ”
24649	24662	24643	24643	She	30	“ Put the ring back on and give me one more chance . ”
24683	24686	24678	24678	her	30	“ Okay . ”
24754	24777	24743	24743	He	486	“ Then it ’s set . How about we go back in , and you can order what you want this time ? ”
24778	24786	24787	24787	She	30	“ I ’d love that , Mister — ”
24810	24813	24797	24797	she	30	“ Benjamin . ”
24927	24931	24932	24932	She	30	“ After you . ”
25019	25045	25003	25003	he	486	“ We need to start over , please . Bring the menus … and an … uh … appletini ? Is that a real thing ? ”
25050	25058	25003	25003	he	486	“ Yes , sir , it is . ”
25059	25065	25066	25066	Benjamin	32	“ Great . Thank you . ”
25138	25144	25145	25145	She	30	“ Our menus are coming . ”
25158	25161	25145	25145	She	30	“ Excellent . ”
25274	25279	25280	25280	She	30	“ By the way … ”
25292	25300	25280	25280	She	30	“ You can take that back now . ”
25301	25313	25314	25314	He	486	“ You do n’t want it , but hear me out . ”
25348	25393	25326	25326	she	30	“ There truly will be a lot of events , and you ’ll need clothes of some sort to wear — it does n’t have to be designer , but you ’ll need something . Do you have a whole closet of ball gowns ? ”
25401	25404	25398	25398	her	30	“ No . ”
25405	25429	25430	25430	He	486	“ So take it . I do n’t want you struggling to buy dresses for events you ’re only attending because of me . ”
25444	25457	25437	25437	he	486	“ Use it for emergencies when you have nothing that will work . ”
25467	25484	25462	25462	she	30	“ I ’ll take it , but I ’ll only buy what I absolutely need to . ”
25554	25557	25614	25614	her	30	“ Good . ”
25558	25583	25584	25584	She	30	“ You said I ’m the boss , but I do n’t want to be . I want this to be an equal partnership . ”
25591	25599	25584	25584	She	30	“ Like a real relationship , basically . ”
25605	25611	25612	25612	She	30	“ Deal . What else ? ”
25620	25633	25614	25614	her	30	“ Let ’s see . We already covered the no kissing part … ”
25640	25663	25614	25614	her	30	“ Until you ask me to , that is . Then that rule is out the damn window , where it belongs . ”
25664	25685	25686	25686	She	30	“ That ’s not going happen , but I ’ll accept your terms , if that makes you feel better . ”
25715	25740	25741	25741	He	486	“ I respect that , and I respect your clause about keeping things businesslike . Just like I appreciate your acceptance of my addendum . ”
25751	25759	25741	25741	He	486	“ Was that professional enough for you ? ”
25864	25873	25855	25855	She	30	“ Well ? Are we good to go ? ”
25874	25877	25878	25878	she	30	“ Yeah , ”
25891	25896	25878	25878	she	30	“ We ’re good . ”
25971	26011	25965	25965	he	486	“ Just for the record ? I reserve the right to do my damnedest to change your mind about the no kissing thing , with every weapon in my arsenal , until you ’re begging me to fuck you . ”
26032	26035	26024	26024	She	30	“ Benjamin . ”
26036	26041	26042	26042	He	486	“ And trust me . ”
26051	26072	26042	26042	He	486	“ It ’s just a matter of time . Once I set my mind on something , I always win . ”
26079	26111	26112	26112	He	486	“ Think what you want , but I never beg . And even if I did ? I ’ve already seen your moves , and they do n’t work on me . ”
26118	26122	26112	26112	He	486	“ Challenge accepted . ”
26123	26129	26130	26130	She	30	“ Oh , hold up . ”
26145	26163	26132	26132	her	30	“ I did n’t lay down a challenge . I would never challenge a man like you . ”
26164	26177	26178	26179	The waiter	449	“ Sure you did . I heard it , loud and clear . ”
26194	26204	26178	26179	The waiter	449	“ Ah . Here ’s your appletini , darling . ”
26205	26216	26217	26217	He	486	“ My — ? I did n’t order one yet . ”
26222	26229	26217	26217	He	486	“ Nope , but I did . ”
26230	26233	26234	26234	She	30	“ But — ”
26247	26256	26234	26234	She	30	“ You remembered I said I wanted one ? ”
26257	26261	26262	26262	He	486	“ I did . ”
26289	26343	26276	26276	she	30	“ From now on , I ’ll always remember what you tell me . I ’ll be waiting , planning , and finding your weaknesses , until you finally accept what I accepted the second you kissed me and called me yours — that we belong together , naked , in a bed . ”
26397	26404	26389	26389	she	30	“ I underestimated you , Benjamin . ”
26405	26418	26419	26419	She	30	“ That ’s okay . I did the same thing to you . ”
26427	26432	26419	26419	She	30	“ But not anymore ? ”
26433	26466	26467	26467	He	486	“ You bet your pretty little ass I wo n’t do it again . Like I said , I plan on using every weapon I can against you , till I win . ”
26519	26525	26516	26516	he	486	“ Including my magical knee . ”
26564	26572	26573	26573	He	486	“ I. Will . Kill . You . ”
26638	26654	26625	26625	he	486	“ Keep trying , if you wish , but no one else has succeeded yet . ”
26655	26663	26664	26664	She	30	“ Oh , but I know things . ”
26694	26699	26684	26684	she	30	“ Lots of things . ”
26715	26719	26700	26700	He	486	“ So do I. ”
26792	26796	26797	26797	she	30	“ To winning ? ”
26805	26810	26811	26811	he	486	“ To you losing , ”
26819	26828	26811	26811	he	486	“ And us both being completely satisfied afterward . ”
26829	26847	26848	26848	He	486	“ Careful , you might blow your load a little too early with all that false confidence . ”
26853	26868	26848	26848	He	486	“ It ’s adorable that you think it ’s false . It really is . ”
26869	26879	26880	26880	She	30	“ You keep chasing , I ’ll keep running . ”
26885	26893	26880	26880	She	30	“ You ’ll see who wins eventually . ”
27001	27005	27006	27006	he	32	“ Thank you , ”
27016	27025	27006	27006	he	32	“ for giving me a second chance tonight . ”
27053	27072	27026	27026	She	30	“ You ’re welcome . Turns out , once you relax , you ’re actually a cool guy . ”
27073	27080	27090	27090	she	30	“ Because I was with you , ”
27141	27146	27153	27153	she	30	“ I had fun . ”
27147	27152	27153	27153	she	30	“ Me , too , ”
27164	27167	27153	27153	she	30	“ Benjamin . ”
27229	27253	27219	27219	She	30	“ You ’re so fucking unique and beautiful that I ’m not even sure what to say to you half the damn time . ”
27314	27324	27328	27328	she	30	“ You can say whatever you want , Benjamin . ”
27342	27352	27328	27328	she	30	“ I ’ll see you at the office Monday ? ”
27353	27359	27360	27360	He	32	“ Yes . Of course . ”
27373	27394	27370	27370	his	32	“ I ’ll leave once I see you turn the light on , so I know you ’re safely inside . ”
27494	27503	27471	27471	He	32	“ Andrew . Thanks for calling me back . ”
27504	27508	27509	27510	his brother	358	“ No problem , ”
27519	27524	27509	27510	his brother	358	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
27525	27536	27537	27537	Andrew	51	“ Nothing . What makes you think something ’s wrong ? ”
27540	27547	27537	27537	Andrew	51	“ Well , you called me . ”
27548	27551	27509	27510	his brother	358	“ Yeah ? ”
27552	27561	27537	27537	Andrew	51	“ You never call unless something ’s wrong . ”
27592	27604	27579	27579	he	32	“ That ’s not true . I called you last week . ”
27605	27610	27611	27611	Andrew	51	“ For my birthday ? ”
27614	27624	27611	27611	Andrew	51	“ Yeah , that does n’t count , Ben . ”
27633	27641	27629	27629	he	51	“ Sorry . Life ’s been busy . ”
27642	27651	27652	27652	He	51	“ I hear you ’ve been working constantly . ”
27655	27675	27652	27652	He	51	“ I also heard you have a new woman in the picture . One Mother does n’t approve of . ”
27676	27681	27682	27682	Andrew	51	“ Big shocker there . ”
27685	27690	27682	27682	Andrew	51	“ Who is she ? ”
27691	27699	27700	27700	He	51	“ My lead researcher . We ’re … ”
27712	27719	27703	27703	he	51	“ We ’re engaged , actually . ”
27720	27731	27732	27732	He	51	“ Whoa ! Another one bites the dust , huh ? ”
27737	27744	27732	27732	He	51	“ Yeah . Something like that . ”
27745	27750	27751	27751	Andrew	51	“ That ’s great . ”
27762	27771	27757	27757	he	51	“ When do I get to meet her ? ”
27772	27784	27732	27732	He	51	“ She ’ll be at the mayor ’s dinner with me . ”
27785	27788	27789	27789	Andrew	51	“ Excellent . ”
27792	27815	27789	27789	Andrew	51	“ Confirmed bachelor , Benjamin Gale the third , finally taken down by a woman . I can see the headlines now . ”
27816	27819	27820	27820	He	51	“ Yeah . ”
27825	27832	27833	27833	Andrew	51	“ I ’m dreading them already . ”
27836	27841	27833	27833	Andrew	51	“ I ’m not . ”
27854	27870	27842	27842	Benjamin	32	“ Hey , did Mother tell you about the motion she wants to put forward ? ”
27871	27874	27875	27875	Andrew	51	“ No . ”
27880	27888	27875	27875	Andrew	51	“ What ’s she up to now ? ”
27889	27908	27909	27909	He	51	“ She wants to propose a motion of no confidence , on account of my nonstop philandering lifestyle . ”
27912	27922	27909	27909	He	51	“ She wants you to take over as CEO . ”
27923	27926	27927	27927	Andrew	51	“ Shit . ”
27936	27962	27927	27927	Andrew	51	“ Is that why you ’re suddenly engaged ? If so , do n’t do it . Do n’t give in to her insane demands . ”
27963	27981	27982	27982	Benjamin	32	“ Nah , the engagement happened before this . We ’ve been dating for a while now . ”
28016	28026	28006	28006	he	51	“ But you seriously were n’t aware of it ? ”
28027	28041	28044	28044	he	51	“ Of course not . I have no interest in taking your position . ”
28211	28228	28229	28229	she	30	“ Just do it , Maggie . Stand up , and announce you ’re dating Benjamin , ”
28253	28294	28295	28295	She	30	“ Yes , I ’ve been secretly dating Mr. Gale , and yes , I have been since before I even started working here . And yes , I ’m engaged to him . He gave me a gorgeous ring . ”
28308	28332	28295	28295	She	30	“ Here it is . Now , can we all move on , and stop staring at me like I ’m a freak ? ”
28375	28386	28387	28387	she	30	“ You can do this . Everything will be fine , ”
28423	28466	28403	28403	She	30	“ It ’s fine . This ’ll be fun . You ’re strong and steady , like that building . Benjamin wo n’t make you cave . You wo n’t kiss him or touch him . You ’re not going to lose . ”
28504	28507	28500	28500	She	30	“ come in ”
28611	28621	28600	28600	he	534	“ Hey . How ’s it going out there ? ”
28622	28630	28631	28631	She	30	“ Awkwardly . They ’re all staring . ”
28666	28690	28691	28691	He	534	“ Like , constantly . I ’m about to drag my desk in here so I can have a closed door , too . ”
28699	28707	28691	28691	He	534	“ Do I need to say something ? ”
28708	28717	28749	28749	he	534	“ No , please . It ’s fine . ”
28718	28721	28722	28722	He	534	“ Okay . ”
28728	28743	28722	28722	He	534	“ Why are you in here , if you do n’t need my help ? ”
28756	28761	28749	28749	he	534	“ We ’re leaving . ”
28762	28765	28766	28766	He	534	“ What ? ”
28776	28834	28773	28773	his	534	“ No way in hell . I ’ve got at least two more hours of work here on my desk , and it ’s only five o’clock . Not to mention , you still have n’t gotten me that report you owe me . I told you it would wait , but I did n’t mean forever . ”
28922	28926	28917	28917	he	534	“ What now ? ”
28927	28934	28935	28935	She	30	“ The same thing as before . ”
28941	28974	28937	28937	her	30	“ It ’s after hours . The ‘ boss ’ you has to go away , and my ‘ fiancé ’ needs to come out to play . We have a date . ”
28989	29005	28980	28980	He	534	“ In that case , come on over . Give me some sugar , darling . ”
29129	29138	29124	29124	she	30	“ Not quite what I had in mind . ”
29139	29142	29143	29143	He	534	“ Pity . ”
29165	29175	29143	29143	He	534	“ What did you have in mind , then ? ”
29176	29179	29180	29180	She	30	“ Me . ”
29184	29187	29180	29180	She	30	“ You . ”
29220	29251	29252	29252	He	534	“ Leaving , together , in front of the whole office . The rest is a secret that you ’ll find out about when we get downstairs to our limo . ”
29257	29263	29252	29252	He	534	“ You hired a limo ? ”
29264	29267	29268	29268	She	30	“ Nah . ”
29323	29340	29341	29341	He	534	“ I called your butler , and he told your driver to be waiting for us . ”
29364	29373	29341	29341	He	534	“ How did you get William ’s number ? ”
29374	29381	29382	29382	She	30	“ I ’m just that good . ”
29412	29436	29437	29437	He	534	“ Now get your coat . We ’re leaving this office , hand in hand , so they see us being super cute . ”
29446	29462	29437	29437	He	534	“ You ’re being bossy . I kind of like it . It ’s hot . ”
29540	29566	29530	29530	he	534	“ Are we going to get through this date without you running away again , or should I change into sneakers , just in case ? ”
29567	29572	29573	29573	She	30	“ You never know . ”
29593	29601	29590	29590	her	30	“ We ’ll see how tonight goes . ”
29602	29609	29610	29610	Benjamin	32	“ So this is a test ? ”
29624	29642	29610	29610	Benjamin	32	“ If so , I intend to pass with flying colors . I do n’t like failing . ”
29643	29651	29652	29653	His mother	118	“ I ’m sure you do n’t . ”
29670	29684	29685	29685	He	534	“ Which is why you ’re doomed for disappointment going up against me . ”
29689	29714	29685	29685	He	534	“ Have I told you how gorgeous you look today , Maggie ? That red blouse really brings out the gray in your eyes . ”
29763	29771	29753	29753	He	534	“ I do n’t have gray eyes . ”
29772	29777	29778	29778	He	534	“ Sure you do . ”
29788	29853	29778	29778	He	534	“ But up close , when you smile , or try not to smile like you ’re doing right now , there are tiny little specks of blue , too . I plan on seeing those blue specks a lot in our time together . I discovered something about myself the other night . I like making you smile more than I like anything . ”
29905	29908	29913	29913	he	534	“ Benjamin … ”
29909	29912	29913	29913	he	534	“ Yes ? ”
30010	30019	30024	30024	He	534	“ What is it you need , darling ? ”
30036	30045	30031	30031	She	30	“ Why do you keep calling me darling ? ”
30046	30055	30056	30056	He	534	“ That ’s what you are to me . ”
30068	30085	30056	30056	He	534	“ And it seemed like a good fit . I was right . It feels good . ”
30086	30092	30096	30096	he	534	“ Yeah … it does . ”
30120	30140	30112	30112	He	534	“ But no one ’s in here , so there ’s no reason for us to kiss , right ? ”
30141	30147	30148	30148	His	534	“ Right . Of course . ”
30171	30174	30167	30167	he	534	“ Sorry . ”
30270	30319	30257	30257	he	534	“ Okay , so when we go out there , we ’ll go to my desk , and I ’ll grab my jacket . You take it from me , and help me put it on . I guess a soft kiss for their benefit will be permitted . ”
30320	30325	30326	30326	he	534	“ Yes , ma’am , ”
30339	30360	30336	30336	She	30	“ It ’s not that I do n’t want to kiss you , Benjamin . It ’s that I do . ”
30553	30557	30533	30533	his	534	“ Ladies first . ”
30558	30570	30571	30571	He	534	“ Do n’t forget . Jacket , help , chaste kiss . ”
30576	30581	30571	30571	He	534	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
30612	30624	30625	30625	he	534	“ Please . Let me help you with that , darling , ”
30675	30680	30664	30664	she	30	“ Thanks , Benji . ”
30687	30698	30681	30681	He	534	“ What the hell ? Never call me that ag — ”
30985	30995	30982	30982	he	534	“ You said to keep it chaste , right ? ”
30996	30999	30982	30982	he	534	“ Huh ? ”
31081	31090	31075	31075	He	534	“ Uh , right . That was perfect . ”
31121	31176	31115	31115	his	534	“ Just for the record , I can do that again later , when we do n’t have anyone watching us . I could have you naked , writhing , and screaming in my bed the second you gave me the green light . And you would n’t regret a damn second of it . ”
31204	31213	31198	31198	his	534	“ Benjamin , that ’s a horrible idea . ”
31214	31219	31220	31220	He	534	“ It might be . ”
31229	31245	31220	31220	He	534	“ But I swear I ’ll make it worth your time … more than once . ”
31287	31295	31277	31277	he	534	“ And that ’s a fucking promise . ”
31611	31621	31603	31603	he	534	“ You walking to our date , or what ? ”
31622	31627	31628	31628	She	30	“ Oh , right . ”
31656	31665	31666	31666	He	534	“ I zoned out for a second there . ”
31681	31685	31686	31686	She	30	“ No worries . ”
31695	31701	31686	31686	She	30	“ I ’m here now . ”
31702	31705	31706	31706	He	534	“ Good . ”
31740	31757	31736	31736	he	534	“ I ’d be pretty damn bored if I was going on this date by myself . ”
31770	31777	31762	31762	she	30	“ But I ’d be safer . ”
31778	31781	31762	31762	she	30	“ Maggie . ”
31799	31806	31807	31807	She	30	“ You ’re doing it again . ”
31816	31820	31807	31807	She	30	“ Doing what ? ”
31821	31826	31813	31813	his	534	“ Talking to yourself . ”
31827	31830	31831	31831	She	30	“ Yeah . ”
31838	31844	31831	31831	She	30	“ I do that sometimes . ”
31854	31859	31848	31848	He	534	“ So you said . ”
31860	31863	31864	31864	She	30	“ Oh . ”
31869	31872	31873	31873	He	534	“ Right . ”
31964	31970	31948	31948	he	534	“ Where are we going ? ”
31971	31976	31986	31986	she	30	“ You ’ll see . ”
31998	32005	31986	31986	she	30	“ First ? Close your eyes . ”
32006	32027	32028	32028	She	30	“ Are you going to strip naked for me ? If so , I ’m not closing my damn eyes . ”
32032	32037	32028	32028	She	30	“ Not a chance . ”
32100	32108	32109	32109	She	30	“ Fine . My eyes are closed . ”
32149	32155	32143	32143	she	30	“ Okay . Open them . ”
32187	32192	32166	32167	A Wendy	64	“ Is that … ? ”
32193	32202	32203	32203	She	30	“ A spicy chicken sandwich and cheese fries ? ”
32214	32223	32203	32203	She	30	“ You bet your last cow it is . ”
32284	32291	32302	32302	she	30	“ How did you find out ? ”
32292	32301	32302	32302	she	30	“ Oh , I ’m just that good , ”
32318	32330	32309	32309	she	30	“ Eat up . I wo n’t judge you … much . ”
32381	32404	32372	32372	He	534	“ I ’m going to have to do double time at the gym tonight after this , but it ’s worth it . ”
32405	32413	32414	32414	she	30	“ Is that when you work out ? ”
32433	32437	32424	32424	He	534	“ At night ? ”
32438	32441	32446	32446	he	534	“ Yeah . ”
32453	32460	32461	32461	She	30	“ I do it before bed . ”
32464	32470	32461	32461	She	30	“ Where do you go ? ”
32471	32475	32476	32476	He	534	“ My place . ”
32485	32492	32476	32476	He	534	“ I have a gym there . ”
32498	32509	32493	32493	She	30	“ Of course you do . I should ’ve guessed . ”
32579	32585	32586	32586	he	534	“ Thanks for the dinner , ”
32604	32609	32597	32597	She	30	“ You ’re welcome . ”
32624	32632	32615	32615	She	30	“ Now that we ’ve stuffed ourselves … ”
32656	32661	32645	32645	They	579	“ What ’s next ? ”
32662	32665	32666	32666	She	30	“ This . ”
32717	32721	32704	32704	he	534	“ Drink up . ”
32740	32749	32730	32730	he	534	“ Where did you find out about this ? ”
32750	32777	32778	32778	She	30	“ That you drink the best wines and whiskeys in public , but truly prefer a twenty - bucks - a - case bottle of beer ? ”
32785	32795	32778	32778	She	30	“ Oh , I have my ways , Benjamin . ”
32893	32898	32899	32899	He	534	“ Let me guess . ”
32908	32932	32899	32899	He	534	“ Our destination is a place that most people would n’t suspect I like to go to , but you somehow discovered it . ”
32957	32973	32974	32974	Jesus	54	“ Fine . I ’ll tell you . We ’re going to the Rangers game . ”
33110	33125	33100	33100	He	534	“ Let me guess . You found out because you ’re just that good ? ”
33126	33141	33142	33142	she	30	“ Nah . That one was easy to figure out all on my own , ”
33147	33159	33142	33142	she	30	“ You have a puck on the corner of your desk . ”
33273	33280	33281	33281	he	32	“ Get the piece of shit ! ”
33296	33300	33281	33281	he	32	“ Fuck yeah ! ”
33315	33321	33322	33322	She	30	“ Sorry . So sorry . ”
33343	33358	33332	33332	she	30	“ You can shout curses in front of me . I wo n’t faint . ”
33516	33520	33521	33521	He	534	“ But still . ”
33573	33589	33590	33590	She	30	“ It ’s a respect thing . Gentlemen should n’t curse in front of ladies . ”
33593	33608	33590	33590	She	30	“ Lucky for you I ’m not a lady . I ’m just me . ”
33609	33616	33617	33617	He	534	“ Ah , but I disagree . ”
33665	33702	33703	33703	She	30	“ You ’re more of a lady , and more deserving of respect , than anyone else I ’ve ever met . You ’re amazing Maggie , and do n’t let anyone else tell you otherwise . ”
33712	33716	33703	33703	She	30	“ Thank you . ”
33717	33722	33723	33723	He	534	“ You ’re welcome . ”
33772	33781	33766	33766	she	30	“ And I ’m sorry for my outburst . ”
33866	33876	33877	33877	She	30	“ It makes me happy , seeing you so … ”
33886	33889	33877	33877	She	30	“ Free . ”
33934	33940	33924	33924	she	30	“ I ’m not free . ”
33941	33955	33956	33956	He	534	“ And you never will be , with your mother on your back . ”
33968	34001	33962	33963	the Zamboni	65	“ It ’s fine . She ’s just got a set of goals in mind for me , and when I do n’t follow through with her plans , she gets upset . ”
34038	34043	34044	34044	she	30	“ I get that , ”
34098	34111	34094	34094	Maggie	30	“ My ex was like that . Overbearing . Controlling . Irrational . ”
34119	34130	34094	34094	Maggie	30	“ I hope you kicked him to the curb quick . ”
34131	34136	34137	34137	She	30	“ Not quick enough . ”
34143	34161	34137	34137	She	30	“ Not before I needed a court order against him to make him to leave me alone . ”
34193	34204	34177	34177	she	30	“ What ’s his name ? I ’ll kill him . ”
34205	34209	34210	34210	She	30	“ No need . ”
34220	34240	34210	34210	She	30	“ He did that himself , after writing me a note that told me it was all my fault . ”
34301	34308	34309	34309	he	534	“ It was n’t your fault , ”
34312	34322	34309	34309	he	534	“ Maybe it was , maybe it was n’t . ”
34331	34378	34323	34323	She	30	“ Either way , it only proves how bad I am at relationships . It ’s why I stopped trying . He was n’t the first guy to show me that love is n’t worth the fight , but I swore he ’d be the last . ”
34512	34515	34516	34516	He	534	“ Christ . ”
34527	34532	34516	34516	He	534	“ I ’m sorry . ”
34554	34558	34546	34546	she	30	“ What for ? ”
34559	34579	34580	34580	He	534	“ For not putting in even a fraction of the effort that you ’ve obviously put into this date . ”
34597	34609	34591	34591	she	30	“ I ’ll do better next time . I swear it . ”
34614	34631	34610	34610	She	30	“ It ’s fine . I mean , it ’s not like we ’re actually dating . ”
34681	34687	34688	34688	She	30	“ So you keep saying . ”
34698	34708	34688	34688	She	30	“ Well , that ’s because it ’s true . ”
34756	34788	34789	34789	Her	30	“ It does n’t matter anymore if this is real , or if it is n’t . I think you ’re fooling yourself , and me . Or maybe I am . ”
34794	34804	34789	34789	Her	30	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re saying . ”
34805	34816	34817	34817	he	534	“ That ’s because I ’m not making any sense , ”
34840	34873	34826	34826	He	534	“ You obviously put a hell of a lot of thought into this date , which either means you wanted to prove a point about how much I screwed up Saturday night — ”
34874	34877	34878	34878	She	30	“ What ? ”
34883	34890	34891	34891	He	534	“ No . Not at all . ”
34900	34918	34891	34891	He	534	“ Or you care about what I think and feel , and wanted to make me happy . ”
34923	34933	34919	34919	She	30	“ Yeah . And so what if I do ? ”
34934	34973	34974	34974	He	534	“ It ’s been a hell of a long time since anyone gave a damn what I wanted . This thing we have between us ? It ’s no longer just for show . Not on my end . ”
34996	35001	34974	34974	He	534	“ I want you . ”
35002	35005	35031	35031	his	534	“ Benjamin … ”
35006	35023	35024	35024	He	534	“ Tell me you do n’t want me , and I ’ll never mention this again . ”
35054	35072	35073	35073	She	30	“ Tell me you do n’t want me to fuck you . Tell me I ’m wrong . ”
35084	35095	35075	35075	her	30	“ You ’re not wrong . I do . But — ”
35096	35099	35100	35100	He	534	“ Shh . ”
35108	35141	35100	35100	He	534	“ You do n’t want to want me , because you think it ’s a horrible idea , and that I ’m going to hurt you like all the guys before me . ”
35142	35145	35146	35146	she	30	“ Right , ”
35154	35181	35146	35146	she	30	“ And you ’re my boss , so when that happens , it ’ll be even worse . That ’s why it ’s a terrible idea . ”
35222	35240	35241	35241	She	30	“ All great ideas start with bad ones . No one gets it right all the time . ”
35244	35255	35241	35241	She	30	“ But this is all happening so fast , and — ”
35256	35263	35264	35264	He	534	“ It ’s not , though . ”
35281	35334	35264	35264	He	534	“ I ’ve wanted you ever since the first day you started working for me . You walked into my office with your hair down . You wore that black skirt , and a blue blouse , with a pair of black heels . Do you remember what you said to me ? ”
35360	35385	35348	35348	she	30	“ I think I told you my name , and informed you that I intended to be the best researcher you ’d ever met . ”
35386	35394	35395	35395	He	534	“ I think you ’ve become that . ”
35398	35413	35395	35395	He	534	“ That ’s how you made this happen tonight . You researched , right ? ”
35414	35428	35429	35429	she	30	“ Seriously . I was just trying to give you a good night , ”
35433	35438	35429	35429	she	30	“ It was nothing . ”
35439	35448	35449	35449	he	534	“ If you want it to be nothing , ”
35458	35471	35449	35449	he	534	“ It can be nothing . Or , it can be something . ”
35472	35478	35429	35429	she	30	“ What do you mean ? ”
35479	35545	35546	35546	He	534	“ I mean if you do n’t want more , I ’ll make sure you never find out how much I want to kiss you again , or how it ’s all I think about . I ’ll stop telling you that what you did for me tonight means something , something real , and I ’ll act like I do n’t give a shit . ”
35551	35573	35546	35546	He	534	“ I ’m good at that . I ’ve had a lot of practice at hiding what I think and feel . ”
35574	35581	35429	35429	she	30	“ I ’d never want that . ”
35587	35596	35582	35582	She	30	“ Do n’t hide your feelings from me . ”
35601	35608	35597	35597	He	534	“ Fine . You want honesty ? ”
35609	35612	35613	35613	She	30	“ Uh … ”
35619	35626	35613	35613	She	30	“ Sure . Go for it . ”
35627	35668	35597	35597	He	534	“ In just these few short days , you ’ve made me feel things I was n’t sure I could anymore , and I think you could do a hell of a lot more , if we both let you . ”
35669	35672	35597	35597	He	534	“ Benjamin — ”
35673	35680	35613	35613	She	30	“ I know . I know . ”
35687	35730	35681	35681	He	534	“ You ’re not interested . But I had to say it . For the first time in years , I want to lay it all out there , in the open for all to see , because you deserve nothing less . ”
35731	35746	35747	35747	she	30	“ Why do you feel like you have to hide your emotions at all ? ”
35781	35788	35771	35771	She	30	“ Never mind . It ’s — ”
35789	35792	35793	35793	He	534	“ No . ”
35803	35865	35793	35793	He	534	“ My father had a heart attack . While they rushed him to the hospital , I was out drinking and getting laid . I did n’t even make it home before he died , and ever since , I ’ve been trying to make up for that . I never will , but it does n’t keep me from trying . ”
35921	35940	35941	35941	She	30	“ That was n’t your fault . You had no way of knowing he would die that night . ”
35950	35969	35970	35970	He	534	“ It does n’t matter . That ’s in the past . I want to talk about now . ”
35981	36017	35970	35970	He	534	“ And right now ? I want you . I want you so damn bad it hurts . And not just because I want to fuck you . I want all of you , Maggie . ”
36018	36021	36022	36022	Her	30	“ I … ”
36038	36047	36028	36028	she	30	“ I ’m not sure what to say . ”
36078	36095	36067	36067	she	30	“ Do you want me to take it back ? To pretend this conversation never happened ? ”
36096	36101	36102	36102	She	30	“ I — no . ”
36110	36119	36107	36107	her	30	“ I do n’t want that at all . ”
36143	36187	36137	36137	she	30	“ How about this ? We treat this whole going out and spending time together like a real thing between us — not romantic , necessarily , but friends . I like you , Maggie , and I want to be your friend . ”
36195	36203	36191	36191	she	30	“ I ’d like that , Benjamin . ”
36204	36233	36234	36234	He	534	“ Then let ’s be real with one another and see where things go . If they turn romantic , we ’ll deal with that when it comes . ”
36237	36285	36234	36234	He	534	“ But if we stay just friends for the rest of our lives , and only friends , I ’m fine with that , too . But I ’m not going to lie . I ’m hoping for more . And I think you are , too . ”
36311	36360	36302	36302	She	30	“ This thing would n’t work . You ’re from a different world than I am . We might be able to make it work for the short - term , fake engagement , but real feelings ? It would never hold . Statistically speaking , we ’re — ”
36361	36375	36376	36376	She	30	“ Do you always read the end of the book before the beginning ? ”
36388	36401	36376	36376	She	30	“ Well , actually , yeah . I do . Every time . ”
36402	36409	36410	36410	he	534	“ Why do you do that ? ”
36423	36455	36413	36413	She	30	“ So I know what to expect . I like advance warning , so I do n’t get attached to anyone or anything that does n’t make it to the end . ”
36456	36468	36469	36469	He	534	“ That might work in fiction , but in real life ? ”
36488	36516	36469	36469	He	534	“ You ca n’t skip ahead to the end , especially not with us . There ’s no way in hell to know how it ’ll end . ”
36517	36520	36521	36521	Her	30	“ But — ”
36530	36539	36521	36521	Her	30	“ Yeah , okay . You ’re right . ”
36540	36574	36575	36575	He	534	“ We ’ll take it slow . Real slow . Spend time together . Start at the beginning of our story , and we ’ll figure out the end when we get there . ”
36582	36600	36601	36601	She	30	“ So , what do you say ? Do you want to read our story with me ? ”
36604	36626	36601	36601	She	30	“ Oh my God . I ca n’t believe I ’m saying this … but yes . Slowly . As friends . ”
36627	36630	36631	36631	He	534	“ Excellent . ”
36703	36729	36698	36698	he	534	“ I ca n’t wait to get to the sex scenes , though . I assure you , they ’ll be worth a second read . ”
36751	36758	36759	36759	He	534	“ You ’re incorrigible , Benji . ”
36762	36767	36759	36759	He	534	“ About that name — ”
36768	36780	36781	36781	She	30	“ I tried it on for size because it felt right . ”
36801	36809	36781	36781	She	30	“ I was right . It stays . ”
36810	36815	36816	36816	He	534	“ Fine , darling . ”
36846	36855	36860	36860	he	534	“ If it stays , so does this . ”
37281	37284	37294	37294	He	32	“ just friends ”
37382	37385	37386	37386	Benjamin	32	“ Hey , ”
37458	37472	37449	37449	his	32	“ Should n’t you be gone by now , getting ready for tonight ? ”
37532	37541	37542	37542	she	30	“ I think this is a horrible idea , ”
37556	37583	37553	37553	He	32	“ So you keep saying . And as I keep saying , you ’ll do fine . Did you use my card to get your outfit ? ”
37584	37589	37590	37590	He	32	“ Yes . But — ”
37595	37602	37590	37590	He	32	“ It ’s red , right ? ”
37603	37606	37611	37611	his	32	“ Yes . ”
37614	37622	37611	37611	his	32	“ I ’ll wear my red bowtie . ”
37623	37633	37634	37634	She	30	“ How can you be so calm about this ? ”
37644	37664	37634	37634	She	30	“ I ’ll make a fool out of myself , and you , and you ’ll regret ever asking — ”
37675	37704	37665	37665	He	32	“ You can stop that sentence right now , because I already told you I do n’t regret a damn thing . Go home . Start getting ready . ”
37705	37711	37671	37671	his	32	“ You ’re being stubborn . ”
37712	37724	37725	37725	He	32	“ And you ’re procrastinating by trying to pick a fight . ”
37757	37772	37773	37773	She	30	“ It wo n’t work , because you ’re too adorable to annoy me . ”
37788	37791	37782	37782	She	30	“ Benji . ”
37792	37802	37807	37807	he	32	“ Not even that annoying nickname will work tonight . ”
37842	37851	37852	37852	He	32	“ Ca n’t blame a girl for trying . ”
37855	37862	37852	37852	He	32	“ The hell I ca n’t . ”
37909	37913	37917	37917	his	32	“ Now go — ”
37924	37932	37921	37921	he	32	“ Stop looking at me like that . ”
37938	37942	37935	37935	her	30	“ Like what ? ”
37978	38005	37971	37971	he	32	“ Like you want to get me naked , and once and for all stop this ‘ just friends ’ bullshit we ’re both suffering through . ”
38018	38029	37971	37971	he	32	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re talking about . ”
38030	38038	38039	38039	He	32	“ Yeah , you are . I — ”
38057	38080	38048	38048	everyone	1201	“ Just go home and get ready . I ’ll pick you up in two hours , and you ’ll look gorgeous . ”
38081	38084	38085	38085	He	32	“ But — ”
38091	38094	38085	38085	He	32	“ Go . ”
38095	38098	38048	38048	everyone	1201	“ Fine . ”
38113	38124	38101	38101	she	30	“ But do n’t say I did n’t warn you . ”
38385	38395	38373	38373	she	30	“ I brought vodka to go with the makeup . ”
38396	38414	38369	38369	she	30	“ Good . I need it . Why are you outside ? You live here , too . ”
38415	38443	38444	38444	Becca	58	“ I was enjoying the sun . It ’s been a while since we had a nice day , and after being in the office all day … ”
38447	38452	38453	38453	She	58	“ It felt good . ”
38474	38481	38453	38453	She	58	“ It is really nice out . ”
38482	38485	38486	38486	Her	58	“ Yeah . ”
38498	38523	38486	38486	Her	58	“ And you were too busy panicking to notice . Why are you so nervous , anyway ? It ’s just a stupid party . ”
38524	38547	38548	38548	Becca	58	“ It ’s not just a party . It ’s the first test — we have to sell this whole thing tonight . ”
38551	38622	38548	38548	Becca	58	“ It ’ll be fine . It ’s not like they ’ll be giving you a lie detector to see if your relationship is legit . All you have to do is drink free booze , hold his hand , and act like you ’re in love with a guy you have n’t stopped blabbering on about all week long . It should n’t be too much of a stretch . ”
38623	38642	38643	38643	Becca	58	“ No , it ’s not , and that ’s exactly why I do n’t want to go . ”
38646	38653	38643	38643	Becca	58	“ I ’m sorry , what ? ”
38654	38698	38699	38699	she	58	“ Benjamin and I are only friends , and I really need it to stay that way , no matter what my stupid ovaries want . But we have n’t even kissed in four days — which is why I need the drink , ”
38716	38732	38699	38699	she	58	“ Because , God , I want him , Becca . I want him bad . ”
38733	38737	38738	38738	Becca	58	“ No kidding , ”
38742	38748	38738	38738	Becca	58	“ I ’m an idiot . ”
38749	38752	38753	38753	She	58	“ Yeah . ”
38763	38774	38753	38753	She	58	“ Always have been , when it comes to men . ”
38784	38789	38775	38775	Maggie	30	“ Gee , thanks . ”
38790	38814	38815	38815	Becca	58	“ You overanalyze everything , and push every interested man out of the picture before they even have a chance to mess up . ”
38826	38831	38815	38815	Becca	58	“ It ’s your MO ”
38832	38843	38844	38844	Maggie	30	“ That ’s because none of them ever make sense , ”
38851	38864	38844	38844	Maggie	30	“ Why waste my time when they never add up on paper ? ”
38870	38918	38844	38844	Maggie	30	“ And they never will . Which is why you do it , if you ask me . It gives you an excuse to get rid of them before they get too close and hurt you , like those other jerks did when you first moved here . ”
38926	38951	38844	38844	Maggie	30	“ That ’s not true . It ’s not my fault the men I ’ve dated are n’t committed enough to prove me wrong . ”
38952	38971	39033	39033	she	639	“ You ’ve been trying to keep this CEO of yours at a distance , have n’t you ? ”
38972	38975	38976	38976	She	639	“ Yeah . ”
38982	38985	38976	38976	She	639	“ And ? ”
38986	38995	38996	38996	Becca	58	“ And he has n’t given up yet . ”
39004	39024	38996	38996	Becca	58	“ Maybe he ’s the guy you ’ve been waiting for . The one who will fight for you . ”
39112	39141	39109	39109	Maggie	30	“ You ’re not helping matters . I ’m supposed to listen to my head , not you , not my ovaries , and certainly not my heart . ”
39142	39166	39167	39167	she	639	“ If you ask me , you ’ve done enough listening to your head . Maybe it ’s time to try something new , ”
39180	39197	39167	39167	she	639	“ You could do worse than a rich CEO . That ’s all I ’m saying . ”
39198	39210	39211	39211	She	639	“ He does n’t show any emotion . Like , ever . ”
39238	39255	39218	39218	She	639	“ I can never even begin to guess what he ’s thinking . It ’s infuriating . ”
39256	39261	39262	39262	She	639	“ So ask him . ”
39265	39272	39262	39262	She	639	“ And when we break up — ”
39273	39281	39282	39282	Becca	58	“ You ’re not even together yet . ”
39290	39308	39282	39282	Becca	58	“ You need to stop guessing how it ’s going to end , and enjoy the ride . ”
39309	39317	39262	39262	She	639	“ Ugh . You sound like him . ”
39318	39326	39327	39327	she	639	“ Then he ’s a smart man , ”
39362	39367	39344	39344	She	639	“ Listen to us . ”
39368	39384	39385	39387	The other woman	273	“ Like you listened to me when I told you Patrick was a bad idea ? ”
39396	39412	39385	39387	The other woman	273	“ Yeah , he ’s a bad idea . That ’s why I picked him . ”
39413	39416	39357	39357	she	639	“ But — ”
39417	39421	39422	39422	She	639	“ Uh uh . ”
39427	39481	39422	39422	She	639	“ This is my lecture , not yours . You have a rich hottie who wants to become your friend before getting in your pants , which is practically unheard of in the dating world nowadays , and you ’re too busy worrying what other people will think of you to enjoy it . ”
39638	39655	39631	39631	she	58	“ I love you . What would I do without you here to tell me off ? ”
39656	39662	39663	39663	Becca	58	“ I ’m not sure . ”
39671	39694	39663	39663	Becca	58	“ But lucky for you , you ’ll never have to find out . You ready to kick some rich ass now ? ”
39695	39698	39631	39631	she	58	“ Yep . ”
39706	39717	39701	39701	she	58	“ Let ’s do this . Make me a princess . ”
39821	39823	39836	39836	He	32	“ fiancée ”
40278	40292	40272	40276	the woman in the door	675	“ Hello . You must be Maggie ’s roommate . I ’m — ? ”
40293	40296	40297	40298	The redhead	676	“ Damn . ”
40305	40315	40297	40298	The redhead	676	“ She did n’t say you were this hot . ”
40316	40319	40297	40298	The redhead	676	“ Uh … ”
40337	40350	40330	40330	He	32	“ I ’m Benjamin Gale the third . And you are … ? ”
40351	40363	40364	40365	the woman	253	“ The third , huh ? Wow . So official sounding , ”
40386	40422	40378	40378	She	253	“ I ’m Becca Marigold , the first , and I was just leaving for my own date . Maggie ’s in her room finishing up , so she ’ll be out in a minute . ”
40440	40450	40423	40423	He	32	“ It was lovely meeting you , Ms. Marigold . ”
40451	40454	40455	40455	she	253	“ Likewise , ”
40459	40470	40455	40455	she	253	“ Good call on the flowers . She hates roses . ”
40531	40534	40542	40543	the woman	253	“ Thanks . ”
40628	40635	40624	40624	His	32	“ Maggie ? I ’m here . ”
40636	40649	40650	40650	she	253	“ I ’ll be out in a second . Make yourself comfortable , ”
40821	40839	40815	40815	she	253	“ Are you going to say something ? Anything ? Will I pass for your impoverished fiancée ? ”
40840	40843	40844	40844	His	32	“ Yes — ”
40884	40893	40880	40880	he	32	“ Yes . You … you look exquisite . ”
40894	40898	40899	40899	She	253	“ Thank you . ”
40914	40920	40899	40899	She	253	“ Are those for me ? ”
40921	40927	40928	40928	Her	253	“ Is what for you ? ”
40932	40939	40928	40928	Her	253	“ The flowers in your hands . ”
40940	40943	40899	40899	She	253	“ Oh . ”
40989	40994	40981	40981	she	30	“ Yes , sorry . ”
40995	41000	41001	41001	she	253	“ It ’s okay , ”
41043	41053	41021	41021	She	253	“ Snowbells . Good guess — I love these . ”
41054	41060	41021	41021	She	253	“ I did n’t guess . ”
41073	41083	41061	41061	He	32	“ You told me you liked them last week . ”
41084	41087	41088	41088	She	253	“ Oh . ”
41091	41095	41088	41088	She	253	“ You remembered ? ”
41096	41101	41102	41102	He	32	“ Well , yeah . ”
41112	41125	41107	41107	his	32	“ I told you I ’d try to do bett — oof . ”
41297	41303	41304	41304	She	253	“ What was that for ? ”
41310	41314	41304	41304	She	253	“ The flowers . ”
41444	41449	41456	41456	she	253	“ You ’re welcome . ”
41482	41507	41470	41470	she	253	“ Did you … did you straighten up in here ? The pillows … and the coffee mugs … and where are my shoes ? ”
41514	41519	41520	41520	He	32	“ Well … I … ”
41552	41564	41565	41565	She	253	“ Uh … you did say to make myself at home . ”
41575	41606	41565	41565	She	253	“ I did , did n’t I ? It ’s cool . I do n’t care if you need to make my couch pretty to sit on it , Benji . ”
41699	41710	41688	41688	he	32	“ Once you ’re ready , we need to go . ”
41711	41720	41721	41721	she	118	“ Okay , just give me a second , ”
41728	41735	41721	41721	she	118	“ I ’ll be right out . ”
41793	41800	41787	41787	she	118	“ What ? What is it ? ”
41801	41813	41814	41814	He	32	“ Nothing . It ’s just … You look absolutely gorgeous . ”
41827	41840	41814	41814	He	32	“ You ’ll be the prettiest woman there , inside and out . ”
41841	41856	41787	41787	she	118	“ Thanks . But I ’m seriously unqualified to be going to this event . ”
41857	41889	41890	41890	He	32	“ Bullshit . You do n’t ever have to be nervous walking into a room full of stuck - up snobs , because you ’re better than all of them combined . ”
41907	41922	41890	41890	He	32	“ You ’re too good for me . So thank you for doing this . ”
41936	41947	41923	41923	She	118	“ I ’m not too good for you , Benji . ”
41955	41961	41948	41948	He	32	“ Yes . You are . ”
41992	42012	42013	42013	She	118	“ But the fact that you do n’t realize that ? It ’s what makes you so damn special . ”
42139	42144	42145	42145	she	118	“ We should go , ”
42172	42175	42161	42161	He	32	“ Benjamin ? ”
42176	42179	42180	42180	He	32	“ Right . ”
42210	42213	42200	42200	he	32	“ Ready ? ”
42223	42231	42214	42214	She	118	“ Yep . Let ’s do this . ”
42325	42333	42334	42334	He	32	“ Oh God . We ’re here . ”
42341	42344	42345	42345	She	30	“ Wait ! ”
42355	42380	42345	42345	She	30	“ I ’m allergic to shellfish . And I ’m an only child . My roommate ’s name is Becca . And my parents — ”
42381	42453	42454	42454	He	702	“ — Are farmers in South Dakota . You have a black cat back home , who you rescued from an alley , and he hides when people come over so I ’ll probably never see him . His name is Lucifer . You also love the Yankees and the Giants , hate the Mets and the Jets , and you like long walks in a light , misting , rain . ”
42466	42474	42454	42454	He	702	“ We ’ve got this , darling . ”
42489	42499	42475	42475	She	703	“ You actually paid attention to all of that ? ”
42500	42530	42531	42531	He	702	“ Of course I did . I want to learn everything about you , because I ’m greedy when it comes to you . I wo n’t pretend otherwise . ”
42540	42562	42531	42531	He	702	“ If you ’re talking ? I ’m listening . We ’ve got this . There ’s nothing to worry about . ”
42568	42575	42563	42563	She	703	“ Okay . I ’m ready . ”
42576	42579	42585	42585	his	702	“ Sir ? ”
42590	42593	42585	42586	his driver	512	“ Madam ? ”
42594	42600	42601	42601	He	702	“ Thank you , Jeff . ”
42613	42616	42601	42601	He	702	“ Darling ? ”
42668	42675	42654	42654	Maggie	30	“ She ’s not here yet . ”
42676	42691	42692	42692	She	703	“ Good . I could use a drink or ten before taking her on . ”
42704	42728	42692	42692	She	703	“ Think she upped her trash talk game yet ? Or will she call me a ‘ lady of the night ’ again ? ”
42743	42768	42692	42692	She	703	“ I doubt she ’s ever actually uttered the word ‘ whore , ’ so I ’d expect her trash talk to remain lame . ”
42769	42772	42773	42773	Maggie	30	“ Figures , ”
42793	42813	42781	42781	She	703	“ Holy crap , is that a Kennedy over there ? He ’s got the eyes and the hair . ”
42822	42827	42814	42814	He	702	“ Hmm ? Where ? ”
42828	42832	42833	42833	She	703	“ Over there . ”
42837	42852	42833	42833	She	703	“ The short guy in black , next to the tall woman in black . ”
42863	42877	42855	42855	his	702	“ You realize that you just described everyone in the room , right ? ”
42887	42896	42897	42897	She	703	“ That ca n’t be true . Look — ”
42919	42938	42910	42910	her	703	“ Wait . Was I supposed to wear black ? If so , I obviously missed the memo . ”
42973	42994	42963	42963	her	703	“ That ’s because there was n’t one . They ’re all dull , while you ’re full of life . ”
42995	42999	43000	43000	She	703	“ But still . ”
43007	43015	43000	43000	She	703	“ Should I wear black next time ? ”
43016	43023	43024	43024	He	702	“ Do n’t change a thing . ”
43030	43040	43024	43024	He	702	“ I like you just the way you are . ”
43048	43052	43024	43024	He	702	“ You do ? ”
43053	43057	43058	43058	He	702	“ I do . ”
43198	43215	43216	43216	he	702	“ People were watching , so I figured it was a good time for a kiss , ”
43232	43240	43222	43222	Her	703	“ For show only , of course . ”
43241	43259	43260	43260	She	703	“ Y - Yes . Good thinking . We ’ll have to do that a lot tonight . ”
43266	43298	43260	43260	She	703	“ I , uh , I see the bar , so I ’m gon na get us some drinks while you check our coats . You want an old - fashioned ? ”
43304	43318	43299	43299	He	702	“ Dare I ask how you found out I like those , darling ? ”
43319	43322	43323	43323	she	703	“ Research , ”
43330	43334	43323	43323	she	703	“ Always research . ”
43370	43382	43383	43383	someone	221	“ Why , if it is n’t Benjamin Gale the third , ”
43389	43396	43383	43383	someone	221	“ It ’s been so long . ”
43474	43483	43464	43464	her	719	“ Elizabeth . How wonderful to see you . ”
43484	43488	43489	43489	She	719	“ I know . ”
43505	43532	43500	43500	her	719	“ Are you here alone , too ? Oh , thank God . I have no one to dance with tonight , so this is perfect . ”
43533	43538	43464	43464	her	719	“ Actually , I — ”
43539	43584	43585	43585	She	719	“ When your mother told me to come , and that you ’d mentioned wanting to see me again , I did n’t believe her . But now I ’m here , and you ’re here , and this could n’t be more perfect . ”
43599	43614	43615	43615	He	702	“ I ’ve missed you , too . But you dreadfully need to shave . ”
43621	43630	43615	43615	He	702	“ My mother told you I missed you ? ”
43631	43635	43636	43637	his mother	118	“ I did , ”
43643	43673	43636	43637	his mother	118	“ I ’m sorry if I betrayed your confidence , but I could n’t let it go . Not when you two are so well suited for one another . ”
43674	43684	43636	43637	his mother	118	“ You could n’t be more right , Helen . ”
43701	43714	43715	43715	She	55	“ We make a great couple . I ’ve always thought so . ”
43971	43977	43978	43978	She	30	“ Sorry , Miss … ? ”
44015	44021	44022	44022	He	730	“ Donovan . Maggie Donovan . ”
44029	44042	44022	44022	He	730	“ Lovely to meet you . Is that for me , sweetheart ? ”
44043	44049	44012	44013	the crowd	711	“ Is what for you ? ”
44050	44054	44055	44055	He	730	“ The drink . ”
44067	44082	44055	44055	He	730	“ Whoever hired you , I ’ll pay double if you keep those coming . ”
44083	44086	44087	44087	He	730	“ Uh … ”
44139	44159	44117	44118	the man	264	“ I ’m not here as an assistant . This is for my fiancé . Maybe you know him ? ”
44160	44176	44177	44177	He	730	“ Oh , so you ’re a … oh . Sorry . Uh … Fiancé ? ”
44185	44191	44182	44182	his	730	“ Who might that be ? ”
44192	44198	44199	44199	Maggie	30	“ Benjamin Gale the third . ”
44202	44207	44199	44199	Maggie	30	“ Of Gale Incorporated . ”
44213	44221	44208	44208	He	730	“ He ’s engaged ? To you ? ”
44237	44247	44222	44222	He	730	“ That ca n’t be . You ’re not … ”
44363	44378	44379	44379	She	30	“ Yes , well , nonetheless , it ’s true . We ’re engaged . ”
44387	44409	44410	44410	He	744	“ He ’s over there , checking our coats and waiting for me . So , if you ’ll excuse me ? ”
44413	44418	44410	44410	He	744	“ That ’s amusing . ”
44419	44422	44423	44423	she	30	“ Oh ? ”
44429	44433	44423	44423	she	30	“ How so ? ”
44434	44453	44454	44454	He	744	“ Well , you see , he ’s over there with my daughter and his mother , Helen . ”
44457	44504	44454	44454	He	744	“ My daughter is his ex , who he is very much interested in making his ‘ future . ’ He informed her of as much just the other day . Ever since she left him , he has n’t been the same , you see . ”
44644	44667	44668	44668	He	32	“ If you ’ll excuse me , I need to return to my fiancé and Helen . They ’ll be expecting me . ”
44674	44691	44668	44668	He	32	“ Do n’t interfere with them . You have no idea what ’s at stake here . ”
44692	44704	44705	44705	She	746	“ Oh , I have every idea what ’s at stake . ”
44710	44717	44705	44705	She	746	“ It was lovely meeting you . ”
44805	44807	44786	44786	he	32	“ relationship ”
45029	45035	45036	45036	he	32	“ What are you doing ? ”
45043	45051	45036	45036	he	32	“ Why did n’t you come over ? ”
45052	45057	45058	45058	She	30	“ You were busy . ”
45063	45072	45058	45058	She	30	“ And I did n’t want to interfere . ”
45078	45109	45073	45073	He	32	“ The whole purpose of you being here is , in fact , to interfere in situations like this . It ’s why you ’re my fiancée , after all . ”
45110	45149	45150	45150	She	30	“ Yeah , but then I figured out you were flirting with a former girlfriend , who you are still very much in love with , and from here … you looked quite content to be doing so . ”
45155	45182	45152	45152	her	30	“ I did n’t want to mess things up if you were looking for a real solution to your problem , instead of a temporary one . ”
45190	45195	45183	45183	His	32	“ Is that so ? ”
45196	45203	45204	45204	She	30	“ Yeah . That ’s so . ”
45223	45267	45210	45211	The blonde	750	“ She ’s pretty . I bet she ’d be a good wife . I did n’t want to ruin your chances by coming up and acting like I was the one you really wanted on you arm , when we both know — ”
45268	45274	45275	45275	He	32	“ You obviously know nothing . ”
45283	45363	45277	45277	his	32	“ If I wanted to marry her , I would n’t have broken up with her in the first place . And you are the one I really want by my side . I made that perfectly clear the other night , when I said we ’d take it slow and see where things went , but that I hoped they ’d go somewhere with us naked in bed together . I was pretty fucking clear what I wanted . ”
45364	45372	45210	45211	The blonde	750	“ Look , it ’s fine if — ”
45377	45386	45373	45373	She	769	“ Wait , you broke up with her ? ”
45387	45395	45396	45396	He	770	“ You ’re damn right I did . ”
45404	45465	45396	45396	He	770	“ So next time , instead of writing a whole damn story in your head , just come the hell over . If I do n’t want to be interrupted , I ’ll wave you off . But you can pretty safely assume I want you to come up and show whoever I ’m talking to that I ’m taken . ”
45533	45542	45528	45528	she	769	“ You mean , I should do something … ”
45594	45603	45589	45589	she	769	“ … more like this , next time ? ”
45613	45616	45604	45604	He	770	“ Yeah . ”
45617	45628	45629	45629	She	769	“ More than a touch ? A kiss , maybe ? ”
45761	45764	45749	45749	He	770	“ Maggie . ”
45780	45785	45773	45773	She	769	“ Yes , Benji ? ”
45810	45858	45807	45807	he	770	“ When we leave here later and get to your apartment , you ’ll have a choice . If you invite me in , I swear you ’ll never doubt your welcome in my arms again , and you ’ll see exactly how much I want you . ”
45884	45887	45872	45872	She	769	“ Benjamin … ”
45888	45900	45901	45901	His	778	“ Yeah . I know . It ’s a bad idea . ”
45905	45923	45901	45901	His	778	“ Let ’s go mingle . The sooner we get this night over with , the better . ”
45924	45933	45938	45938	his	778	“ How long do we have to stay ? ”
45962	45975	45950	45950	He	778	“ Until they all see us , and realize we ’re engaged . ”
46556	46558	46564	46564	He	778	“ knew ”
46616	46624	46625	46625	She	30	“ You did great tonight , darling . ”
46668	46678	46662	46662	he	778	“ Thanks . I think it went fairly well . ”
46679	46683	46684	46684	He	778	“ It did . ”
46687	46725	46684	46684	He	778	“ Thank you , again , for doing this . There are more exciting ways to spend your nights than with snobs who have nothing better to do with their lives than gossip about everyone else ’s . ”
46726	46741	46684	46684	He	778	“ It ’s fine . I did n’t mind doing it … for you . ”
46875	46897	46870	46870	he	778	“ I ’ll pick you up tomorrow at five for Rockefeller Center , and then two on Sunday for the theatre . ”
46898	46901	46902	46902	She	30	“ Okay . ”
46911	46926	46927	46927	He	778	“ Look , about earlier , when I kissed you , and you said — ”
46933	46966	46927	46927	He	778	“ I got caught up in the moment . You made it quite clear you want to keep this thing between us platonic , and I should n’t have pushed for more . ”
46967	46970	46971	46971	He	778	“ But — ”
46977	46992	46971	46971	He	778	“ I ’m sorry , and I take it back . All of it . ”
46993	46996	46997	46997	She	30	“ Okay . ”
47004	47015	46997	46997	She	30	“ Well , then … good night , I guess . ”
47021	47025	47018	47018	his	778	“ Good night . ”
47087	47095	47096	47096	she	30	“ Do you want to come in ? ”
47100	47105	47096	47096	she	30	“ Have a drink ? ”
47111	47144	47145	47145	She	30	“ I do . But if I come in there , I ’m following through on every promise I ’ve made , and you ’ll be screaming my name within the hour . ”
47150	47156	47147	47147	her	30	“ Is that a promise ? ”
47157	47170	47171	47171	He	778	“ Damn right it is , which is why I should leave . ”
47183	47199	47200	47200	She	30	“ You ’re not ready , darling . I should n’t have pushed you earlier . ”
47256	47259	47252	47252	He	778	“ woman . ”
47260	47265	47266	47266	She	30	“ Like I said … ”
47272	47277	47266	47266	She	30	“ Wanna come in ? ”
47295	47299	47300	47300	He	778	“ Hell yeah . ”
47377	47380	47366	47366	She	30	“ Beer ? ”
47381	47384	47385	47385	he	778	“ Sure , ”
47406	47409	47410	47410	She	30	“ Thanks . ”
47606	47609	47593	47593	she	30	“ So … ”
47615	47618	47610	47610	He	778	“ So ? ”
47619	47627	47628	47628	She	30	“ How do you think tomorrow — ? ”
47642	47650	47639	47639	her	30	“ You know what ? Screw this . ”
47670	47678	47657	47657	she	30	“ Hey . I was drinking that . “
47683	47704	47657	47657	she	30	” She straddled his lap and cupped his face . His heart lurched , and his cock thickened with need . “
47726	47744	47724	47724	Benji	62	” He held her still , digging his fingers into her thighs , but did n’t move . “
47756	47757	47752	47752	you	778	” “
47764	47774	47752	47752	you	778	” She buried her hands securely in his hair . “
47779	47780	47752	47752	you	778	” “
47788	47810	47811	47811	Maggie	30	” he said , sliding his hands down her legs , and back up — only this time under her skirt . “
47813	47976	47811	47811	Maggie	30	” He kissed her fully . All the other times they ’d kissed , minus the time he ’d made her come , he ’d held himself back . Had n’t let himself get caught up in the moment . Well , not this time . This time , he was all fucking in . She gasped and clung to him , rolling her hips against him hungrily . He entwined his tongue with hers , loving the way she tasted . Hell , she tasted like she was his — and he liked that . He slid his hands up her curves . If he was a poetic man , he could write a verse or two about the way her waist flared out slightly at her hips , intoxicating him . He arched up , rubbing against her warm core , and she moaned , pressing down firmly . She broke the kiss off and drew in a ragged breath . “
47985	47995	47982	47982	I	0	” He brushed her hair out of her face . “
48013	48032	48033	48033	You	814	” He picked her up and laid her down on the couch , lowering his body over hers . “
48071	48257	48057	48057	you	814	” He kissed her again , gently , and after a moment of hesitation , she kissed him back , wrapping her legs and arms around him . That was all the answer he needed . This . Skimming his fingers up her soft thigh , he cupped her ass , hauling her closer to him as he deepened the kiss . She gasped and dug her nails into his shoulders , her tongue circling his . Something that felt this good , this right , could n’t be wrong . And he refused to believe it could be . Smoothly , he stood and picked her up without breaking her hold on him , or their kiss . He headed for the hallway to the left , where she ’d come from earlier . When he pushed through the door , he strode to the bed in the middle of the room , tossed her on it and yanked his bowtie off . There was a meow , a hiss , and claws scratching against wood as her cat bolted out of the room . “
48260	48300	48057	48057	you	814	” A laugh escaped her , and he joined her as he dropped his bowtie to the floor . And it felt fucking amazing to be undressing a woman and laughing over something as silly as a damn cat . “
48318	48363	48307	48307	He	815	” She watched him closely , licking her lips and pressing her thighs together . It was , hands down , the most erotic thing he ’d ever seen . Just like that , his mood shifted from amused to unquenchable lust for Maggie . “
48368	48381	48307	48307	He	815	” she said . Crossing the room , he did as told . “
48384	48391	48307	48307	He	815	” he managed to grit out . “
48396	48421	48307	48307	He	815	” She rolled over and opened the drawer next to her bed . Taking out a foil packet , she tossed it at him . “
48426	48476	48477	48477	Benjamin	32	” He undid the buttons of his shirt , and she lifted herself up on elbows . When his shirt was off , he grabbed his waistband , uncertain whether he should take his pants off or not . She had n’t removed a single article of clothing yet . “
48479	48491	48477	48477	Benjamin	32	” she said , her voice coming out a little bit strangled “
48508	48563	48564	48564	You’re	32	” He bit back a moan . He planned on making her say that again , later , louder . And naked . Not wasting time , he flicked his wrist and let his pants hit the floor . Her breath came in short bursts , her chest rising and falling in short bursts . “
48572	48578	48579	48579	Your	32	” He cocked a brow . “
48588	48634	48564	48564	You’re	32	” She rose up on her knees , turning her back to him . He studied her for any signs of hesitation . As much as he wanted her , he needed to make sure she would n’t regret this . Would n’t regret him . “
48638	48675	48564	48564	You’re	32	” He swallowed hard , stepping closer . Gently , he pushed her hair over her shoulder , exposing the nape of her neck . Leaning down , he kissed the spot directly above her spine . “
48681	48694	48676	48676	You	32	” He unzipped a bit , and kissed the skin he bared . “
48698	48710	48676	48676	You	32	” Some more , and another kiss halfway down her spine . “
48714	48749	48676	48676	You	32	” He hit the bottom of the zipper and pushed the dress off her shoulder . This time , instead of a kiss , he nipped the skin at the small of her back . “
48753	48838	48676	48676	You	32	” Shuddering , she faced him , holding her dress on at the shoulders . After taking a deep breath , she let go , and he staggered back . Actually staggered back . The swell of her hips was the sexiest thing he ’d ever seen , and he could n’t look away . Her large breasts were encased in a sheer black bra , and her panties were pretty much nonexistent . That was somehow even sexier than no panties at all . “
48841	48858	48676	48676	You	32	” he gritted out , grabbing a hold of her and flipping her onto her back . “
48870	48887	48888	48888	Benjamin	32	” She gasped and arched her back , digging her nails into the comforter beneath her . “
48896	48897	48898	48898	Me	0	” “
48904	48934	48938	48938	Maggie	30	” He nipped right above her knee , swirling his tongue over the love bite to sooth the sting . She hissed in a breath , writhing against him . “
48940	48941	48942	48942	You	32	” “
48944	48948	48942	48942	You	32	” she breathed . “
48954	48970	48938	48938	Maggie	30	” She cupped her core , shooting him the naughtiest look he ’d ever seen . “
48973	49063	49064	49064	Ben	32	” When she bit her lip and rolled her hips , touching herself , he laid his hand over hers , stilling her fingers . He was all too happy to give her what she wanted . He kissed a slow path up her thigh , slowing even more when he neared her barely there lingerie , and she struggled to move her fingers underneath his . Arching her hips up , she threaded her free hand in his hair . He inhaled deeply . She smelled like heaven . “
49068	49074	49064	49064	Ben	32	” She lifted herself up . “
49079	49179	49077	49077	you	32	” He removed her hand , tore her thong off , and tossed it over his shoulder . Groaning , he ran his fingers over her small patch of soft brown curls , and over her clit . She cried out , spreading her legs more for him . And what a pretty picture she was . All swollen lips , pink skin , and desire . Leaning in , he flicked his tongue over her , sliding his hands under her perfect ass to lift her up . She cried out and closed her thighs around his head . “
49189	49247	49185	49185	Benjamin	32	” He closed his mouth over her , swirling his tongue in wide , gentle circles . His cock begged to be buried inside her , but it would have to wait . First , she had to scream , cry , and plead . She had to need him , damn it . Like he needed her .
49465	49468	49460	49460	he	32	“ Yes . ”
49469	49479	49480	49480	he	32	“ I love it when you make that sound , ”
49523	49527	49528	49528	He	32	“ So sexy . ”
49618	49621	49622	49622	he	32	“ Maggie , ”
49865	49891	49845	49845	His	32	“ I ’m trying to take it slow . To make love to you slowly , but damn it , I need you , darling . ”
49892	49897	49898	49898	She	817	“ Then stop trying . ”
49909	49915	49898	49898	She	817	“ Go slow next time . ”
49916	49920	49921	49921	he	32	“ Next time , ”
49988	49991	49970	49970	He	32	“ Yeah . ”
49992	49999	49970	49970	He	32	“ Unless you do n’t want — ”
50000	50006	50007	50007	He	32	“ Oh , I want . ”
50015	50020	50009	50009	his	32	“ I fucking want . ”
50168	50171	50156	50156	She	817	“ Benjamin . ”
50172	50185	50186	50186	He	32	“ Shh . I ’m here , Maggie . I have you . ”
50191	50206	50186	50186	He	32	“ Hold on tight , darling . I promise I wo n’t let go . ”
50269	50272	50273	50273	He	32	“ Jesus . ”
50294	50306	50287	50287	his	32	“ You feel … too … fucking … good . Addicting . ”
50485	50490	50491	50491	He	32	“ Jesus , Maggie . ”
50517	50523	50503	50503	his	32	“ That was fucking incredible . ”
50549	50553	50554	50554	He	32	“ It was . ”
50613	50625	50626	50626	he	32	“ Still think I ’m the worst mistake you ever made ? ”
50651	50654	50635	50635	she	817	“ Nope . ”
50655	50658	50659	50659	He	32	“ Progress . ”
50682	50685	50670	50670	He	32	“ Good . ”
50698	50738	50688	50688	her	817	“ But it does n’t have to change anything if you do n’t want it to . This could happen again , or it could be a one time only thing , and we go back to being friends . ”
50778	50819	50831	50831	He	32	“ I do n’t expect anything out of you at all , just because you saw me naked . I ’m one hundred percent okay with going back to the way things were , if that ’s what you want . ”
50820	50830	50831	50831	He	32	“ Are you now ? How great to know . ”
50891	50912	50844	50844	His	32	“ I get it . You ’ve been hurt by some jackass before . But I ’m not that guy . ”
50913	50921	50844	50844	His	32	“ I know you ’re not him . ”
51013	51036	51037	51037	He	830	“ You could say I do n’t exactly have the best track record with men , like , ever . At all . ”
51060	51067	51068	51068	he	830	“ Have you ever loved anyone ? ”
51071	51074	51075	51075	she	817	“ Wow , ”
51128	51155	51122	51122	he	830	“ Deep talk . Are you sure we ’re ready for this ? I mean , we literally just finished having sex for the first time . ”
51156	51178	51179	51179	He	830	“ I think it ’s a great time , because you said that you did n’t think I was a mistake . ”
51231	51241	51221	51221	He	830	“ After which you immediately tried to run away . ”
51242	51248	51249	51249	She	817	“ I did n’t run . ”
51255	51265	51249	51249	She	817	“ I did n’t even get out of bed . ”
51266	51275	51276	51276	He	830	“ Does n’t mean you were n’t running . ”
51290	51320	51276	51276	He	830	“ You ’re pushing me away again , just like you do every time I get too close to you . It ’s getting really fucking old , Maggie . ”
51408	51413	51414	51414	she	817	“ I ’m sorry , ”
51427	51440	51441	51441	He	830	“ I did n’t mean to do that . To hurt you . ”
51519	51524	51512	51512	He	830	“ Look at me . ”
51576	51586	51561	51561	she	817	“ What do you want from me , Benjamin ? ”
51587	51593	51594	51594	He	830	“ You . Just you . ”
51620	51694	51604	51604	he	830	“ You say one thing , and then do another , and I have no damn clue what you want from me . You ’ve been hurt before , and you ’re scared to risk letting another man in . But you ’ve got to try , or we do n’t stand a chance in hell of making it outside this room . Can you do that ? Can you let me in ? ”
51748	51765	51738	51738	She	817	“ You ’re right . I am scared . But that ’s because I see how — ”
51766	51771	51772	51772	he	830	“ How this ends , ”
51779	51782	51775	51775	She	817	“ Yeah . ”
51783	51786	51787	51787	He	830	“ Bullshit . ”
51810	51832	51802	51802	he	830	“ You ca n’t know how something is going to end before it even begins . It ’s not humanly possible . ”
51833	51854	51802	51802	he	830	“ I think it began a while ago , so it ’s not too hard to understand what comes next . ”
51855	51861	51862	51862	He	830	“ So what happens now ? ”
51867	51874	51862	51862	He	830	“ Go on . Tell me . ”
51880	51891	51892	51892	He	830	“ You got what you wanted , so you leave . ”
51897	51901	51892	51892	He	830	“ Excuse me ? ”
51902	51905	51906	51906	She	817	“ Sex . ”
51911	51923	51906	51906	She	817	“ You got it , and now you ’ll move on . ”
51924	51934	51935	51935	he	830	“ Is that really what you think of me ? ”
51957	51977	51949	51949	His	830	“ Do you think I fucked you , and now I ’m finished with you ? Just like that ? ”
51978	51997	51998	51998	She	817	“ Not to hurt me , or anything . It ’s not anything personal . It ’s just … ”
52003	52014	51998	51998	She	817	“ It ’s how guys are . I get it . ”
52015	52020	52021	52021	His	830	“ Jesus , Maggie . ”
52049	52063	52025	52025	he	830	“ I had no idea you had such a poor opinion of me . ”
52064	52070	52071	52071	she	817	“ It ’s not you , ”
52097	52102	52103	52103	He	830	“ It ’s me . ”
52106	52119	52103	52103	He	830	“ Wow . I ’ve never had that used on me before . ”
52120	52142	52094	52094	she	817	“ N - No . I ’m not breaking it off with you . That ’s not what I ’m saying . ”
52143	52153	52154	52154	He	830	“ What the fuck do you want , Maggie ? ”
52160	52188	52154	52154	He	830	“ You want me to stay , or to go ? Care , or not care ? Tell me what you want , and it ’s yours . ”
52221	52242	52213	52213	he	830	“ I want you to stay , to care , but that scares me . It scares me a lot . ”
52243	52246	52247	52247	He	830	“ Why ? ”
52254	52263	52247	52247	He	830	“ Because I ’m such an uncaring beast ? ”
52264	52306	52213	52213	he	830	“ You ’re right . Because every time I ’ve let someone into my heart , all it ’s done is given him a weapon to use against me . And nine times out of ten ? He used that weapon . ”
52307	52317	52213	52213	he	830	“ Who used the weapon on you , Maggie ? ”
52318	52323	52324	52324	She	817	“ Who did n’t ? ”
52344	52462	52463	52463	Benjamin	32	“ I told you about one of my exes , but what you do n’t realize is they ’ve all hurt me . They ’ve all done horrible things . The one before the last one not only broke my heart , he tore it to shreds . Slept with my best friend back home , right in front of me , but I was too stupid to notice . And when I finally did see it ? He did n’t even stop . Just invited me to join . She laughed at me . So did he . The guy before him literally stole from me . My wallet . My TV . All of it . ”
52470	52479	52463	52463	Benjamin	32	“ I ’m not that kind of guy . ”
52480	52511	52512	52512	She	835	“ Maybe not . But there have been other guys like him . Every man I ’ve trusted with my heart has broken it . Broken me or robbed me . ”
52538	52592	52522	52522	she	835	“ So , I do n’t let myself care anymore . I push people away before they get close enough to hurt me . But with you , it ’s harder than usual . I want to care . I want to let you in . That ’s the God ’s honest truth . ”
52593	52596	52597	52597	he	32	“ Maggie … ”
52609	52659	52605	52605	She	835	“ And the worst part is , I can never tell what you ’re thinking . You say you need me with one breath , but with the next you act as if you would n’t even blink if I left you . I ca n’t freaking read you . ”
52730	52738	52739	52739	he	32	“ I can usually read your reactions , ”
52742	52805	52739	52739	he	32	“ but I ca n’t predict them ahead of time . And that ’s new for me . So we ’re both in uncharted territory , here . And I do n’t like to let people in , either . I do n’t really know how . No one ever let me in , so I did n’t want to , either . ”
52812	52824	52806	52806	She	835	“ And yet you want me to do it for you ? ”
52825	52834	52835	52835	He	32	“ Because I ’m doing it for you . ”
52842	52924	52925	52925	He	32	“ With you , I drop all my acts and pretenses . I ’m the real me . The one I ’ve become so good at hiding . Gales do n’t show emotion . It ’s just not done . And once my dad died , I stopped . I ’ve been trying to be this person I ’m not , but around you — I can be me , Maggie . You have no idea how fucking good that feels . ”
52933	52993	52925	52925	He	32	“ But I ’m not trying to hurt you , and I do n’t want a weapon to use against you . If you trust me , and let me in , I swear not to use that against you . That ’s the last thing I ’d do . I want to make you happy , not sad . ”
53009	53012	52999	52999	she	837	“ Benjamin … ”
53013	53019	53020	53020	He	32	“ Let me try something . ”
53060	53099	53053	53053	he	32	“ There . I ’m letting you in too , see ? So we both have a weapon in our hands , ready to strike or lay down on the floor . What do you say about that ? ”
53137	53144	53133	53133	she	837	“ Drop it on the floor . ”
53145	53148	53149	53149	His	32	“ Done . ”
53155	53173	53149	53149	His	32	“ What about you ? Will you stop pushing me away every time I get too close ? ”
53174	53177	53178	53178	She	837	“ Yes . ”
53183	53187	53178	53178	She	837	“ I promise . ”
53222	53234	53214	53214	he	32	“ I wo n’t make you sorry . I swear it . ”
53656	53669	53633	53633	Her	30	“ What are we seeing , again ? I ca n’t remember . ”
53670	53699	53700	53700	He	32	“ I forget the name , but it ’s a show about choices . It ’s off Broadway now , but it ’s a special performance for charity . ”
53712	53739	53740	53740	She	30	“ It ’s about a woman and the way two parallel lives play out based on a decision she makes in the beginning of the show . ”
53756	53761	53740	53740	She	30	“ Wow , okay . ”
53762	53765	53806	53806	her	30	“ What ? ”
53766	53794	53795	53795	She	30	“ Well , it just kind of reminds me of the other night at my place . That was a pretty big choice Friday night , right ? ”
53809	53830	53795	53795	She	30	“ We both decided to take this thing we have , roll with it , and hope for the best . ”
53839	53849	53831	53831	He	32	“ Yeah , we did , did n’t we ? ”
53865	53868	53853	53853	her	30	“ I — ”
53869	53881	53882	53883	his mother	118	“ Well , look who it is . The happy lovebirds , ”
53889	53894	53895	53895	She	30	“ How … sweet . ”
53992	53995	53996	53996	He	32	“ Mother . ”
54022	54024	54029	54029	She	30	“ love ”
54037	54052	54029	54029	She	30	“ How lovely to see you . No one told me you were coming . ”
54053	54061	54062	54062	She	30	“ It was a last minute decision . ”
54113	54121	54122	54122	He	32	“ Your brother had an extra ticket . ”
54132	54135	54124	54124	his	32	“ Lovely . ”
54136	54145	54146	54146	She	30	“ Yes , that ’s how Andrew is . ”
54159	54171	54146	54146	She	30	“ Always sharing what he has with those he cares about . ”
54172	54175	54176	54176	Andrew	51	“ Benjamin . ”
54186	54192	54176	54176	Andrew	51	“ Good to see you . ”
54193	54196	54197	54197	He	51	“ Hey . ”
54215	54225	54226	54226	Benjamin	32	“ We missed you at the gala last night , ”
54229	54236	54237	54237	He	32	“ Something came up last minute . ”
54255	54262	54250	54250	he	32	“ You must be Ms. Donovan . ”
54263	54266	54250	54250	he	32	“ Maggie . ”
54272	54298	54299	54299	Andrew	51	“ And you must be the brother I ’ve heard so much about . You work in the other Gale Incorporated office downtown , right ? ”
54305	54308	54299	54299	Andrew	51	“ Indeed . ”
54309	54316	54317	54317	she	30	“ It ’s lovely meeting you , ”
54322	54325	54326	54326	Andrew	51	“ Likewise . ”
54330	54347	54326	54326	Andrew	51	“ Let me introduce you to my wife . She ’s over there , in black . ”
54348	54354	54355	54355	Maggie	30	“ Of course she is , ”
54359	54367	54355	54355	Maggie	30	“ I ’d love to meet her . ”
54368	54374	54375	54375	Benjamin	32	“ I ’ll wait here , ”
54451	54468	54441	54441	her	118	“ I assume you got my messages , Benjamin ? All twenty - six of them ? ”
54469	54473	54474	54474	He	32	“ I did . ”
54480	54509	54474	54474	He	32	“ Sorry , we ’ve been busy socializing all weekend , and introducing Maggie to everyone , so I did n’t have a chance to return your calls . ”
54510	54514	54515	54515	she	118	“ How delightful , ”
54519	54528	54515	54515	she	118	“ I ’m sure they all adore her . ”
54529	54533	54534	54534	he	32	“ They do , ”
54538	54548	54534	54534	he	32	“ Did you listen to my messages at all ? ”
54562	54583	54558	54558	her	118	“ Obviously , you did n’t . After all , she remains at your side , despite my numerous warnings . ”
54631	54679	54619	54619	Benjamin	32	“ Oh , I heard every word . You wanted me to settle down . I did . I found a woman who makes me happy , and now you want me to leave her and find someone that does n’t . Does that sum it up ? ”
54680	54683	54684	54684	She	30	“ Happy ? ”
54691	54699	54684	54684	She	30	“ What a silly , fleeting concept . ”
54700	54715	54716	54716	Maggie	30	“ I used to think so , too . But then I met her . ”
54730	54739	54726	54726	He	32	“ And I saw how wrong I was . ”
54740	54746	54747	54747	she	30	“ You ’re actually serious , ”
54755	54763	54747	54747	she	30	“ About this … this … woman ? ”
54764	54768	54769	54769	He	32	“ Dead serious . ”
54787	54825	54769	54769	He	32	“ Funny how life works , huh ? Right when you decided you ’d had enough of me being single , I met her , and fell in love . It all just kind of works out . ”
54832	54866	54826	54826	She	30	“ She is not acceptable . You need to marry someone of good breeding . Someone like Elizabeth . Someone who can bring something to the table besides her skills in the bedroom . ”
54867	54876	54877	54877	he	32	“ Do n’t talk about her like that , ”
54919	54948	54902	54902	Maggie	30	“ I ’m not with her because of anything she gives me . I ’m with her because she makes me happy . And because I adore her . ”
54949	54965	54996	54997	His mother	118	“ Even if that ’s true , what can she possibly offer you in return ? ”
54966	54972	54973	54973	He	32	“ Herself . Just herself . ”
54978	54995	54973	54973	He	32	“ Turns out that ’s all I need . Now , if you ’ll excuse me ? ”
55013	55103	54996	54997	His mother	118	“ Do n’t be a fool . Settling down with a woman like her is as good as not settling down at all . I did n’t fight as hard as I did , for as long as I did , to keep your inheritance intact , only to watch you squander it away on a gold digger . Pick someone with an appropriate background , or I ’ll do everything in my power to unseat you as CEO . And I swear to God , I will win . ”
55141	55155	55125	55125	she	30	“ Andrew does n’t even want my job . He told me so . ”
55169	55204	55156	55156	He	32	“ Your threats are empty , Mother . You have no play to make here , so I ’m calling your bluff . The truth is , I just do n’t believe you anymore . ”
55205	55227	55228	55228	She	30	“ Why do you think Andrew was with me last night , then , if he ’s not ‘ interested ’ ? ”
55231	55267	55228	55228	She	30	“ You foolish boy . I had the highest paid members of the board , their wives , and your brother over for dinner last night — while you were playing house with that woman . ”
55281	55284	55228	55228	She	30	“ What ? ”
55285	55326	55327	55327	She	860	“ The motion has already begun . I ’d hoped to knock some sense into you , but if you insist on this foolhardy plan to marry someone without a penny to her name … you’ll be finished . Ruined . ”
55332	55344	55329	55329	her	860	“ And you ’ll have no one to blame but yourself . ”
55367	55376	55352	55352	she	860	“ Why do you hate me so much ? ”
55377	55401	55402	55402	she	860	“ I told you I was willing to do what needs to be done to protect the things I care about the most , ”
55409	55436	55402	55402	she	860	“ I refuse to watch you ruin the company to which I dedicated my whole life , because you found a woman who makes you happy . ”
55453	55467	55468	55468	He	859	“ Why is being happy so damn bad ? Actually , never mind . ”
55504	55512	55513	55513	She	860	“ What kind of mother are you ? ”
55518	55572	55515	55515	her	860	“ The kind who will stop at nothing to win . What kind of son are you ? Oh , dear . We already know the answer to that , do n’t we ? You ’re a wastrel and a scoundrel who is too busy to come to his dying father ’s bedside . ”
55598	55608	55616	55616	she	860	“ Wow . Guess the gloves are off now . ”
55609	55615	55616	55616	she	860	“ They ’ve been off , ”
55625	55633	55616	55616	she	860	“ You ’ve just never noticed before . ”
55651	55710	55634	55634	He	859	“ I ’ve done nothing but try to make this company my life . To try to make up for not being there . I ’ve never wavered from doing my best for the company , and I am one hundred percent committed to the success of my father ’s life work , even if I did n’t … ”
55717	55741	55713	55713	his	859	“ I was practically a kid when he died . You ca n’t hold that against me for the rest of my life . ”
55774	55782	55767	55767	He	859	“ I can , and I will . ”
55800	55828	55829	55829	She	118	“ You have until Monday night to lose the girl . If you do n’t , I ’ll move forward on my motion . Enjoy the show . ”
55996	56002	56003	56003	Maggie	30	“ Everything okay over here ? ”
56017	56027	56012	56012	She	30	“ You look like you ’ve seen a ghost . ”
56028	56035	56036	56036	He	859	“ Not a ghost , exactly . ”
56059	56064	56045	56045	She	30	“ It ’s nothing . ”
56115	56126	56127	56127	Maggie	30	“ It obviously is n’t nothing . You ’re upset . ”
56134	56142	56127	56127	Maggie	30	“ What did she say to you ? ”
56143	56148	56149	56149	He	859	“ Just the usual . ”
56192	56198	56189	56189	he	859	“ Ready to go in ? ”
56199	56207	56208	56208	she	30	“ Ah , there it is again , ”
56215	56220	56208	56208	she	30	“ There what is ? ”
56221	56225	56226	56226	She	30	“ The beast . ”
56234	56282	56226	56226	She	30	“ You do n’t have to talk to me if you do n’t want to , and I wo n’t pressure you to tell me what she said , but it ’s okay to be upset . You can let me see it . Let me in . ”
56307	56316	56302	56302	he	859	“ You said you could n’t read me . ”
56317	56328	56329	56329	She	30	“ I guess I ’m a little better at it . ”
56352	56362	56342	56342	her	30	“ Tell me the truth . Are you okay ? ”
56363	56366	56367	56367	He	859	“ Yeah . ”
56376	56382	56367	56367	He	859	“ I ’ll be fine . ”
56383	56390	56391	56391	He	859	“ Still want to go in ? ”
56446	56463	56464	56464	She	30	“ Yes . Let ’s go see the show . I ’ve heard it ’s excellent . ”
56483	56514	56480	56480	she	30	“ Want me to go say ‘ whore ’ to her , so you can watch her faint from the vulgar language from her son ’s even more vulgar fiancée ? ”
56561	56564	56565	56565	He	859	“ I — ”
56692	56695	56696	56696	he	859	“ Darling , ”
56706	56712	56696	56696	he	859	“ You ’re killing me . ”
56721	56725	56716	56716	her	30	“ It worked . ”
56726	56730	56716	56716	her	30	“ What worked ? ”
56731	56737	56738	56738	She	30	“ I made you laugh . ”
56753	56760	56738	56738	She	30	“ That ’s all I wanted . ”
56761	56764	56765	56765	He	859	“ You . ”
56788	56799	56778	56778	She	30	“ You ’re amazing . You know that , right ? ”
56809	56821	56800	56800	She	30	“ I may have heard that a few times last night … ”
56822	56830	56831	56831	He	859	“ And you ’ll hear it again . ”
56836	56840	56831	56831	He	859	“ And again . ”
56846	56850	56831	56831	He	859	“ And again . ”
57485	57494	57495	57495	He	859	“ Benjamin . Yes . Now . Please . ”
57517	57569	57506	57506	He	859	“ All I ’ve been able to think about all damn day was getting you home , lifting this dress , and fucking you so hard you would n’t be able to walk straight for the rest of the night . I need you , darling . I need you now . ”
57602	57609	57599	57599	He	859	“ Shit , are you — ? ”
57610	57627	57628	57628	She	30	“ I ’m fine , and I ’m on the pill . Have been for years . ”
57650	57663	57643	57643	she	30	“ Do n’t you dare stop . Do it again . Harder . ”
57683	57694	57672	57672	his	859	“ How about that ? Hard , fast , rough ? ”
57695	57698	57699	57699	She	30	“ Yes . ”
57732	57735	57736	57736	He	859	“ Benjamin . ”
57875	57880	57885	57885	he	859	“ So damn pretty . ”
57896	57901	57885	57885	he	859	“ So fucking mine . ”
57907	57919	57885	57885	he	859	“ Yes , I ’m yours . And you ’re mine . ”
57956	57978	57939	57939	His	859	“ Damn right I am . Do n’t you ever doubt that . I ’m all yours — happily and willingly . ”
58034	58042	58024	58024	She	30	“ Me too . I swear it . ”
58144	58151	58162	58162	His	859	“ I ’m gonna … I … ”
58152	58161	58162	58162	His	859	“ Me too . Fuck , me too . ”
58222	58225	58226	58226	he	859	“ Maggie , ”
58275	58285	58269	58269	He	859	“ I ’m serious about what I said earlier . ”
58286	58290	58291	58291	she	30	“ Which part ? ”
58316	58325	58305	58305	his	859	“ You ’ll have to be more specific . ”
58326	58332	58333	58333	His	859	“ I have no doubts . ”
58350	58405	58341	58341	he	859	“ You make me … happy . I did n’t think I knew what that was , or if it was even a real thing , until you . But now I do , and I do n’t want to let go of it . I do n’t want to let go of you . ”
58434	58471	58476	58476	he	859	“ You make me happy , too . And in case you have n’t noticed , I ’m still holding onto your hand with both of mine . I do n’t want to let go either . ”
58540	58546	58534	58534	he	859	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
58547	58555	58556	58556	She	30	“ I ’m still wearing my purse . ”
58561	58571	58556	58556	She	30	“ I did n’t even take off my purse . ”
58606	58613	58586	58586	he	859	“ The things you find funny … ”
58645	58656	58631	58631	he	859	“ I got you something . Do n’t be mad . ”
58675	58681	58657	58657	She	30	“ What did you do ? ”
58682	58710	58711	58711	He	859	“ I saw this , and I could n’t help but think it would be perfect for the party at the Met on the twenty - third . ”
58720	58748	58711	58711	He	859	“ You usually pick your outfits , and I know you do n’t like me spending money on you , but I could n’t resist this one . ”
58779	58784	58777	58777	him	859	“ Is it black ? ”
58785	58788	58789	58789	He	859	“ No . ”
58792	58795	58789	58789	He	859	“ Never . ”
58866	58875	58883	58883	He	859	“ Oh my God . It ’s beautiful . ”
58876	58882	58883	58883	He	859	“ I could n’t resist . ”
58913	58951	58897	58897	He	859	“ The blue matches those flecks that show up in your eyes when you smile . And since I plan on making you smile a lot that night , it seemed like it was made for you . ”
58952	58957	58958	58958	she	30	“ It ’s perfect , ”
58966	58978	58979	58979	He	859	“ You ’re perfect . I love it . Thank you . ”
59005	59020	58996	58996	his	859	“ You ’re the perfect one . Not me . I ’m just me . ”
59100	59103	59094	59094	her	30	“ I — ”
59113	59119	59120	59120	He	859	“ Who could that be ? ”
59125	59146	59120	59120	He	859	“ I have no idea , since it ’s not my phone . Answer it , we ’ll find out . ”
59147	59153	59159	59159	she	30	“ It ’s probably just — ”
59171	59192	59159	59159	she	30	“ Oh . It ’s my parents . They never call this late . Could you give me a second ? ”
59197	59211	59193	59193	Benjamin	32	“ Sure . I ’ll go grab us a couple bottles of water . ”
59212	59215	59216	59216	She	30	“ Thanks . ”
59243	59250	59238	59238	she	30	“ What ’s wrong , Mom ? ”
59251	59256	59257	59257	She	30	“ Nothing ’s wrong . ”
59260	59298	59257	59257	She	30	“ But Lou called a few minutes ago . We got word from the bank , and we ’re going to find out tomorrow at nine a.m. if we got the grant that could keep us running . ”
59339	59353	59379	59379	She	30	“ Did Lou give you any indication of the verdict when he called ? ”
59354	59378	59379	59379	She	30	“ No , he said he was n’t told yet . He just heard the answer was waiting for him on his desk . ”
59386	59397	59379	59379	She	30	“ I do n’t have a good feeling about this . ”
59398	59411	59412	59412	Maggie	30	“ Do n’t think like that . You have to think positively . ”
59469	59486	59487	59488	Her mom	900	“ If you believe it can be saved , it will . You taught me that . ”
59491	59499	59487	59488	Her mom	900	“ I did , did n’t I ? ”
59500	59503	59504	59504	She	30	“ Yes . ”
59518	59553	59516	59516	Benjamin	32	“ The farm wo n’t be shut down . I swear I ’ll do everything I can to make sure it stays open , before we have to resort to something drastic and final . ”
59554	59563	59568	59568	her	900	“ That ’s not your job , dear , ”
59572	59607	59568	59568	her	900	“ It ’s mine . And this is our last resort . We ’ve exhausted every avenue we could . If we do n’t get a loan or a grant … it ’s over . ”
59659	59682	59708	59709	her mom	900	“ I refuse to accept that . There has to be a way to get the money . There just has to . ”
59695	59701	59690	59690	Maggie	30	“ Do n’t lose faith . ”
59702	59707	59708	59709	her mom	900	“ I wo n’t , ”
59799	59812	59813	59813	He	32	“ I have to go now . I ’m not at home . ”
59847	59856	59857	59858	Her mother	455	“ Are you at that guy ’s house ? ”
59861	59869	59857	59858	Her mother	455	“ The one you told me about ? ”
59882	59885	59878	59878	He	32	“ Yes . ”
59886	59892	59857	59858	Her mother	455	“ Is he there now ? ”
59893	59896	59897	59898	Her mom	900	“ Yes … ”
59901	59907	59897	59898	Her mom	900	“ Can he hear me ? ”
59908	59911	59912	59912	she	900	“ Yes , ”
59916	59921	59912	59912	she	900	“ He probably can . ”
59934	59947	59931	59931	he	32	“ Why are we all whispering ? Is someone listening to us ? ”
59959	59988	59954	59954	she	30	“ Okay , I have to go now . Love you , Mom . And … don’t worry . It ’ll all be fine . You ’ll see . ”
60029	60037	60013	60013	He	32	“ You told your parents about me ? ”
60038	60041	60042	60042	She	30	“ Yeah . ”
60050	60057	60042	60042	She	30	“ Is that a bad thing ? ”
60058	60061	60062	60062	He	32	“ No . ”
60066	60076	60062	60062	He	32	“ I told my mom about us , too . ”
60082	60087	60077	60077	She	30	“ No , really ? ”
60088	60091	60094	60094	he	32	“ Really . ”
60099	60110	60094	60094	he	32	“ Is everything okay , though ? You sounded upset . ”
60111	60116	60117	60117	She	30	“ It ’s fine . ”
60120	60125	60117	60117	She	30	“ I ’m fine . ”
60126	60129	60158	60158	his	32	“ Okay … ”
60169	60197	60158	60158	his	32	“ Remember when I told you my father died of a heart attack , and I was too busy partying to bother to show up in time ? ”
60271	60274	60275	60275	His	32	“ Yeah ? ”
60279	60381	60382	60382	She	912	“ When I finally listened to my voicemail and found out what happened , I rushed to the hospital , breaking all kinds of traffic laws , but he had died ten minutes before I got there . My mother … she would n’t even let me see him before they took him away . I did n’t fight it , because I felt like I deserved every ounce of shit I got from her . I ’ve spent the last few years trying to become a man he would have been proud of . Trying to model myself after him . ”
60433	60482	60483	60483	He	915	“ You do n’t have to change who you are , Benjamin . I bet if your father were here — wait , scratch that . He is here . And he ’s watching . I ’m positive he ’s pretty freaking proud of what you ’ve accomplished . ”
60489	60564	60483	60483	He	915	“ I ’m not so sure . The man you see at the office , the one I was before you came into my life ? That ’s the me I was trying to be . The me I was trying to become . But with you … I ca n’t do it . I ca n’t be pragmatic , focused , and completely dedicated to my work . You make me too happy . ”
60573	60583	60483	60483	He	915	“ Is that a bad thing , or good ? ”
60584	60593	60594	60594	He	915	“ I have n’t figured that out yet . ”
60605	60624	60599	60599	his	915	“ Will you stay the night with me , darling ? I do n’t want to lose you . ”
60632	60642	60625	60625	She	916	“ There ’s nowhere else I ’d rather be . ”
61100	61105	61098	61098	Maggie	30	“ What ’s up ? ”
61106	61116	61098	61098	Maggie	30	“ That ’s no way to greet your mother . ”
61135	61143	61123	61123	He	32	“ Mother . What a pleasant surprise . ”
61144	61150	61151	61151	She	30	“ I bet it is . ”
61185	61218	61219	61219	He	32	“ This is what you ’re looking for . You wo n’t find it in those reports , or hear about it in a board meeting with a bunch of clueless investors . ”
61226	61232	61219	61219	He	32	“ Wo n’t find what ? ”
61233	61281	61282	61282	She	30	“ The evidence that this company needs a merger with Reginald to keep running . I ’ve kept it hidden from you because I did n’t want you find out how your father ran us into the ground , but I should have told you years ago . ”
61287	61308	61282	61282	She	30	“ It ’s why I kept pushing you to marry Elizabeth . If you do , Reginald will save us . ”
61309	61315	61316	61316	He	934	“ How did you … ? ”
61346	61351	61336	61336	he	934	“ Wait . What ? ”
61352	61383	61389	61389	she	30	“ When you called a board meeting , I was informed . They also told me you went over financials extensively , so it was clear what you were seeking . ”
61398	61418	61389	61389	she	30	“ These are the real reports . The ones no one but the two of us can ever see . ”
61437	61470	61389	61389	she	30	“ But how would no one else find out about it ? All the shareholders , and board members … That does n’t make any sense . They would have to know . ”
61471	61486	61487	61487	She	30	“ No , they do n’t . Because I ’ve kept it from them . ”
61525	61543	61544	61544	He	934	“ I ’ve hidden the truth from everyone . I only just told Andrew this past weekend . ”
61549	61554	61544	61544	He	934	“ But … how ? ”
61555	61576	61577	61577	He	934	“ How did I keep it a secret ? Or how did it all fall apart in the first place ? ”
61614	61617	61607	61607	he	934	“ Both . ”
61618	61650	61651	61651	She	30	“ I ’ve always been good at hiding what I want to hide , once I put my mind to it . At putting on a show . A good face . ”
61656	61701	61651	61651	She	30	“ As for the other question , we lost everything through a series of bad decisions made by your father that led to financial ruin . We ’re doomed , Benjamin , and need an influx of money if we ’re going to survive . ”
61728	61733	61717	61718	Jesus Christ	54	“ I … see . ”
61734	61738	61739	61740	His mother	118	“ Do you ? ”
61755	61792	61739	61740	His mother	118	“ Reginald agreed to bail out the company if you marry Elizabeth . We need her money . Gale Incorporated needs it , or it ’ll die . And your father ’s memory , with it . ”
61835	61852	61853	61853	She	30	“ Why did n’t you tell me sooner ? I could have tried to do something . ”
61859	61942	61853	61853	She	30	“ I did n’t think it would come to this . I thought you would do your duty and marry Elizabeth , as you should have all along . But you went and picked that woman , and you ’ve forced my hand . Do n’t worry . Your ‘ fiancée ’ will bolt as soon as she discovers you ’re poor . I have no doubt of that . Gold diggers like her always flee at the slightest scent of poverty . ”
61943	61948	61949	61949	He	937	“ She ’s not — ”
61997	62010	61980	61980	Maggie	30	“ You know what ? Get the hell out of my office . ”
62011	62030	62031	62031	She	30	“ I understand that you ’re upset , but that ’s no way to talk to your mother . ”
62040	62074	62031	62031	She	30	“ I ’ll go . But Elizabeth is stopping by in three hours . I told her you ’ll be asking her to marry you , and I expect you to follow through . ”
62094	62104	62082	62082	he	937	“ How dare you tell her such a thing ? ”
62105	62125	62126	62126	She	30	“ I dare because I have faith you ’ll do the right thing , for once in your life . ”
62136	62163	62130	62130	her	30	“ I raised you to do it . I expect it . So does your father . Or are you going to let him down again ? ”
62430	62435	62418	62418	He	937	“ Who is it ? ”
62436	62441	62442	62442	Maggie	30	“ It ’s me . ”
62462	62469	62444	62444	her	30	“ Do you have a second ? ”
62530	62535	62536	62536	he	937	“ I ’m busy , ”
62542	62547	62536	62536	he	937	“ Make it quick . ”
62575	62580	62565	62565	She	30	“ Are you okay ? ”
62581	62584	62585	62585	he	937	“ No , ”
62589	62603	62585	62585	he	937	“ I ’m not fucking okay . Now is n’t a good time . ”
62617	62622	62604	62604	She	30	“ Oh . Sorry . ”
62693	62701	62702	62702	She	30	“ Well ? What did you want ? ”
62744	62772	62735	62735	He	937	“ I have to … I mean … I had a question . My parents got bad news today , and … well , uh , I — ”
62821	62850	62851	62851	Her	30	“ Jesus Christ . Spit it the fuck out . I do n’t have all damn day to sit here while you get up the nerve to speak . ”
62855	62872	62851	62851	Her	30	“ What ’s your problem ? Forget it . I do n’t want your help anymore . ”
62873	62880	62917	62917	He	937	“ Great . Just fucking great . ”
62881	62885	62851	62851	Her	30	“ Screw you . ”
62908	62916	62917	62917	He	937	“ Come on , you stupid door . ”
62954	62963	62939	62939	he	937	“ What . Did . You . Want ? ”
62973	62981	62964	62964	She	30	“ N - Nothing . Forget it . ”
62982	62985	62986	62986	He	937	“ Maggie . ”
63034	63039	63020	63020	he	937	“ Just tell me . ”
63040	63046	63063	63063	her	30	“ I — I’m leaving . ”
63078	63084	63063	63063	her	30	“ Where are you going ? ”
63085	63092	63093	63093	She	30	“ Home . I have to — ”
63103	63126	63093	63093	She	30	“ I mean , I quit . I ca n’t be your researcher , or your fiancée , or … your anything . ”
63171	63179	63165	63165	he	937	“ What happened ? What ’s changed ? ”
63180	63192	63165	63165	he	937	“ Everything ’s changed . I — I have to go . ”
63193	63201	63202	63202	He	937	“ Tell me why , damn it . ”
63224	63231	63217	63217	he	937	“ Why are you leaving me ? ”
63232	63238	63239	63239	she	30	“ Stop yelling at me , ”
63246	63256	63239	63239	she	30	“ Let me go . I want to go . ”
63270	63288	63267	63267	his	937	“ Damn it . I — I need you . Need this . You ca n’t just — ”
63294	63307	63267	63267	his	937	“ I ’m sorry I yelled . Please , just — just — ”
63442	63449	63433	63433	She	30	“ I said let me go . ”
63461	63468	63433	63433	She	30	“ Jesus . What ’s — ? ”
63469	63479	63480	63480	She	30	“ I have to go home to South Dakota . ”
63489	63526	63480	63480	She	30	“ I just wanted to tell you that I ’m leaving . I have to go pack , or I ’ll miss my flight . It ’s over . I ca n’t be your fiancée anymore . ”
63581	63584	63585	63585	She	30	“ Wow . ”
63593	63616	63585	63585	She	30	“ I just — you ca n’t help me out of this . You can’t — it ’s not something your money — ”
63620	63634	63635	63635	He	937	“ Money ? What the hell does money have to do with — ? ”
63689	63700	63701	63701	She	30	“ My mother already told you , did n’t she ? ”
63704	63711	63701	63701	She	30	“ Wait , what ? I — ”
63712	63733	63734	63734	He	937	“ Never mind , I do n’t give a damn what the hell you have to say at this point . ”
63748	63771	63734	63734	He	937	“ Get the fuck out of here . Do n’t let the door hit you on the ass on the way out . ”
63772	63775	63776	63776	Her	30	“ Benjamin . ”
63780	63789	63790	63790	she	30	“ I did n’t mean to hurt you , ”
63794	63800	63790	63790	she	30	“ But I have to — ”
63801	63817	63818	63818	He	937	“ — Go . Yeah . I got that loud and clear , Ms. Donovan . ”
63823	63849	63818	63818	He	937	“ So , go , then . No one ’s stopping you , least of all me . You want out ? You ’re out . ”
63868	63879	63863	63863	she	30	“ You ’re angry with me . Let me explain — ”
63911	63929	63960	63960	her	30	“ I ’m not angry . I ’m just waiting for you to get the hell out . ”
63935	63956	63957	63957	she	30	“ Look , I ’m sorry I did n’t have the opportunity to give the proper two weeks ’ notice , ”
63966	63992	63957	63957	she	30	“ I hope that wo n’t affect any references I might need from the company . And I ’m sorry if I let you down . ”
64070	64094	64059	64059	she	30	“ I do n’t give a damn about any of that . If you ’re going , go . I do n’t care . ”
64250	64257	64242	64242	He	937	“ Son of a fucking bitch . ”
64295	64302	64279	64279	her	55	“ Is this a bad time ? ”
64305	64308	64309	64309	She	30	“ No . ”
64327	64340	64309	64309	She	30	“ I gather your mother told you I ’d be coming by . ”
64341	64344	64345	64345	He	937	“ Yeah . ”
64386	64413	64414	64414	She	30	“ We ’re supposed to get married and live happily ever after now , because my mother says we have to . That sound about right ? ”
64425	64432	64414	64414	She	30	“ Well … yeah . Basically . ”
64500	64507	64508	64508	he	937	“ You want to marry me , ”
64520	64523	64516	64516	She	30	“ Yes . ”
64524	64527	64528	64528	He	937	“ Why ? ”
64555	64597	64598	64598	She	30	“ Why the hell would you want to marry me ? I ’m apparently poor , as well as a jerk . We never really got along when we were dating , and the chemistry between us is pretty much nonexistent . ”
64612	64618	64619	64619	She	30	“ That ’s not true . ”
64754	64757	64758	64758	she	30	“ See ? ”
64777	64780	64767	64767	She	30	“ Electrifying . ”
64791	64798	64786	64786	he	937	“ I ca n’t marry you . ”
64799	64805	64806	64806	She	30	“ Yes , you can . ”
64819	64824	64806	64806	She	30	“ And you will . ”
64825	64828	64829	64829	He	937	“ No . ”
64834	64889	64829	64829	He	937	“ I ’d eat you alive like the monster I am . You do n’t want to be married to a guy like me . I ’ll make you miserable , and you ’ll want to kill me , or yourself , or both of us . It wo n’t work . Trust me . ”
64890	64898	64899	64899	She	30	“ But I want to marry you . ”
64907	64954	64899	64899	She	30	“ I always have . I do n’t love you , and I do n’t want you to love me . I just want to unite our families . Build a legacy to hand down to our kids , and their kids , and so on . ”
64987	64994	64995	64995	She	30	“ I think you ’re crazy . ”
65019	65034	65035	65035	He	937	“ At least think about it ? Do n’t dismiss it out of hand . ”
65104	65109	65110	65110	he	937	“ Want a drink ? ”
65117	65121	65110	65110	he	937	“ With you ? ”
65129	65132	65133	65133	He	937	“ Yes . ”
65148	65157	65145	65145	he	937	“ To a world without love and pain . ”
65677	65680	65681	65681	He	32	“ date . ”
65763	65766	65751	65751	she	55	“ No . ”
65792	65795	65786	65786	He	986	“ No . ”
65796	65803	65804	65804	someone	221	“ Charming , is n’t it ? ”
65818	65825	65804	65804	someone	221	“ They found one another again . ”
65829	65844	65804	65804	someone	221	“ Let me guess . You gave him a little push after I left ? ”
65845	65856	65857	65858	Mrs. Gale	45	“ That ’s what mothers do , is n’t it ? ”
65863	65899	65857	65858	Mrs. Gale	45	“ Guide our children into making the right choices . We ’ll stop at nothing to ensure they reach their full potential , and I assure you , I ’m more determined than most mothers . ”
65924	65944	65919	65919	She	30	“ I ’m glad you got what you wanted , Helen . I just hope he does , too . ”
65945	65970	65971	65971	she	30	“ Do n’t worry , he ’ll be just fine . He ’s missed her ever since she left him . He loved her , ”
65985	66004	65971	65971	she	30	“ Always has , ever since they were children . You ca n’t compete with something like that . ”
66005	66012	66013	66013	she	30	“ I thought he left her , ”
66016	66024	66013	66013	she	30	“ Is that what he told you ? ”
66030	66041	66025	66027	The older woman	249	“ And you believed him ? Have you seen her ? ”
66075	66081	66082	66082	She	249	“ Poor , naive child . ”
66087	66121	66082	66082	She	249	“ He probably wanted to save face , because he could n’t get over losing her . This whole charade with you was a ploy to get her attention , and it worked . ”
66126	66133	66122	66122	Maggie	30	“ I do n’t believe you . ”
66134	66151	66152	66152	She	249	“ You do n’t have to believe me . You saw it with your own eyes . ”
66158	66183	66152	66152	She	249	“ Run along now , child . Your job here is finished , and your parents will be needing you in this trying time . ”
66265	66270	66271	66271	She	30	“ Wait a second . ”
66285	66295	66271	66271	She	30	“ How did you find out about my parents ? ”
66296	66302	66303	66305	The other woman	273	“ Oh . About that ? ”
66311	66317	66303	66305	The other woman	273	“ I ’m the buyer . ”
66325	66330	66320	66320	her	30	“ What ? Why ? ”
66331	66338	66339	66340	Mrs. Gale	45	“ It got rid of you . ”
66343	66372	66373	66373	She	30	“ And now you know that I could destroy your parents ’ last chance of getting a profit out of that tiny piece of dry , unworkable land . ”
66378	66392	66375	66375	her	30	“ It would be that easy to ruin them . To ruin you . ”
66437	66442	66428	66428	She	1002	“ You would n’t . ”
66443	66474	66475	66475	She	30	“ Oh , but I would . And I ’d enjoy it , too . It ’s what I ’m best at , squashing little ants that threaten my plans . ”
66481	66504	66475	66475	She	30	“ So I suggest you leave before he sees you , and before I decide to step on you just for fun . ”
66510	66522	66475	66475	She	30	“ Why are you doing this to me … to us ? ”
66523	66544	66545	66545	She	30	“ Oh , honey . We ’ve been in a battle since the second I found you under that table . ”
66553	66578	66579	66579	She	30	“ And I refuse to do business with a woman like you for another second . Get out , or your parents lose everything . ”
66584	66649	66579	66579	She	30	“ You ’re a vile person . All you do is twist and turn things until you get what you want , and you treat your own son like a criminal . At some point , he ’s going to stop accepting your hatred as his punishment . At some point , he ’ll have enough , and you ’ll lose him , too . ”
66657	66703	66654	66654	she	30	“ That might be true . But regardless , if you want my money to save your parents from living in destitution for the rest of their lives , run along quickly , and forget all about Benjamin Gale . He ’s not for you . ”
66704	66715	66716	66716	Maggie	30	“ You ’re wrong . He ’s not for you , ”
66719	66750	66716	66716	Maggie	30	“ You do n’t deserve someone like him for a son . He ’s a good guy , you ’re just too much of a coldhearted bitch to appreciate it . ”
66757	66802	66751	66752	The witch	1003	“ If you miss that flight , I ’ll retract my offer and spread word that the land is n’t worth anything . No one else will buy it , and your parents will be penniless . And it ’ll be all your fault . ”
66803	66806	66807	66807	Maggie	30	“ I — ”
67144	67150	67125	67125	she	55	“ What are you saying ? ”
67192	67203	67204	67204	He	32	“ I ’m saying that I ca n’t marry you . ”
67213	67221	67204	67204	He	32	“ You need to leave . Now . ”
67222	67225	67226	67226	He	32	“ But — ”
67232	67237	67226	67226	He	32	“ Leave . Now . ”
67279	67290	67291	67291	Elizabeth	55	“ You ’re a real beast . You know that ? ”
67296	67302	67291	67291	Elizabeth	55	“ Yeah . I do . ”
67315	67329	67330	67330	She	308	“ I ’m surprised it took you so long to notice , though . ”
67447	67452	67453	67453	he	32	“ What the hell ? ”
67463	67469	67470	67471	his mother	118	“ That was uncalled for , ”
67495	67515	67516	67516	He	32	“ She ’s always been a nice girl . Far too nice for a spoiled brat such as yourself . ”
67530	67544	67516	67516	He	32	“ Jesus Christ . How long have you been standing there watching me ? ”
67545	67548	67549	67549	She	118	“ Benjamin . ”
67554	67557	67549	67549	She	118	“ Language . ”
67571	67593	67563	67563	he	32	“ Hey , it ’s Maggie . I ’m not available at the moment , so leave a message . Bye . ”
67610	67624	67625	67625	He	32	“ It ’s me . Call me back . We need to talk . ”
67636	67646	67625	67625	He	32	“ I ’m sorry . Please . Call me . ”
67658	67663	67647	67647	He	32	“ She ’s gone . ”
67670	67676	67667	67667	her	118	“ I watched her go . ”
67687	67694	67667	67667	her	118	“ When did you see her ? ”
67695	67709	67710	67710	She	118	“ When you were busy kissing Elizabeth . She saw that , too . ”
67740	67764	67765	67765	He	32	“ Do n’t worry , though . She was n’t upset . The money she made off of you was well worth it . ”
67832	67838	67899	67899	She	1023	“ What did you do ? ”
67839	67898	67899	67899	She	1023	“ Nothing . I simply informed her you would n’t be able to buy her farm , like she ’d hoped . It ’s why she roped you in . Her parents finally lost the valiant battle to keep their useless , insignificant business afloat . She was going to beg you to buy it and save her . ”
67915	67943	67899	67899	She	1023	“ So I told her that would n’t happen , but that I ’d buy it if she left . So I did . And she did . ”
67959	67970	67899	67899	She	1023	“ You bought her off , and she took it ? ”
67971	67975	67976	67976	She	1023	“ She did . ”
67986	68000	67976	67976	She	1023	“ Here ’s the paperwork , in case you do n’t believe me . ”
68001	68004	68005	68005	He	1024	“ But — ”
68036	68055	68056	68056	She	1023	“ It was all a lie . The money … it ’s there . It ’s all there . ”
68059	68092	68056	68056	She	1023	“ Figured that out , did you ? I ’m not surprised . You always were a bright boy , when you chose to apply yourself . You simply chose not to . ”
68093	68099	68100	68100	Benjamin	32	“ Yeah . I did . ”
68103	68110	68100	68100	Benjamin	32	“ Why did you do this ? ”
68111	68200	68201	68201	Her	1026	“ She had to think you were poor and could n’t help her . And you had to believe you were poor , too , or she would n’t buy it , and you would n’t have let her go . You gave me the idea when you started poking around in the financials . So , the credit truly goes to you . I dug out those old papers , handed them off , and the rest just fell into place . It was perfect , really . ”
68205	68247	68201	68201	Her	1026	“ You ’re not a pauper after all . You do n’t need to marry Elizabeth — though I still wish you would — and that backwoods gold digger is out of our lives once and for all . I won . ”
68274	68278	68268	68268	he	1027	“ Get out . ”
68279	68289	68290	68290	His	1027	“ All right . I have dinner plans anyway . ”
68298	68331	68334	68334	she	118	“ Be angry all you want , but you ’ll thank me later , when you meet a proper woman and realize I saved you from the biggest mistake of your life . ”
68356	68366	68348	68348	Maggie	30	“ What was your biggest mistake ? Having me ? ”
68367	68371	68372	68373	His mother	118	“ Close enough . ”
68376	68382	68372	68373	His mother	118	“ Pretending you were mine . ”
68383	68386	68387	68387	he	1027	“ What ? ”
68403	68413	68398	68398	She	118	“ Are you saying I ’m not your son ? ”
68414	68439	68440	68441	His mother	118	“ Of course you ’re not . Your father slept with his secretary a year after we got married , and got her pregnant . ”
68453	68498	68449	68449	her	118	“ Not wanting to face the shame , I helped him cover it up — and buy her off . I went on a European tour , and came back with a baby . With you . And I ’ve hated you ever since . ”
68509	68516	68449	68449	her	118	“ I ’m not your son ? ”
68517	68522	68530	68530	Her	118	“ You ’re not . ”
68575	68582	68540	68540	she	118	“ Where ’s my real mother ? ”
68583	68586	68587	68587	She	118	“ Dead . ”
68591	68599	68587	68587	She	118	“ Has been since you were five . ”
68607	68611	68587	68587	She	118	“ Thank you . ”
68612	68616	68617	68617	She	118	“ Wh — ? ”
68626	68630	68617	68617	She	118	“ For what ? ”
68631	68651	68652	68652	He	1027	“ The truth . I feel a lot better about you hating me now , and even understand why . ”
68660	68669	68670	68670	She	118	“ Now , if you ’ll excuse me ? ”
68676	68688	68689	68689	she	118	“ I did n’t tell you to make you feel better , ”
68741	68747	68748	68748	He	1027	“ Son of a bitch . ”
68923	68965	68915	68915	he	1027	“ I do n’t believe you took the money as a bribe , so you have to tell me I ’m right . Call me back and tell me you did n’t use me to save your farm . Tell me . ”
69531	69536	69514	69514	Maggie	30	“ What the — ? ”
69537	69540	69541	69542	Her mom	900	“ Maggie ! ”
69567	69573	69574	69574	She	30	“ Look ! Come look ! ”
69599	69606	69592	69592	Helen	78	“ What ? What is it ? ”
69607	69635	69636	69636	She	30	“ We ’ve been awarded a grant . Some big league heavy hitter in New York paid off our debt and is letting us keep the farm . ”
69642	69663	69636	69636	She	30	“ Some sort of new forgiveness program for little food - producing farms like ours . Can you believe it ? ”
69807	69820	69793	69798	the man who ’d ruined her	1061	“ Wow . Go tell Dad . He ’ll be so happy . ”
69821	69825	69826	69827	Her mother	455	“ I know . ”
69838	69841	69842	69842	She	30	“ Glen ! ”
70191	70213	70178	70178	her	30	“ You can get right back in that car and drive off . You ’re not welcome here , Mr. Gale . ”
70214	70217	70218	70218	He	32	“ No . ”
70255	70272	70218	70218	He	32	“ I ’m not going anywhere . Not until you hear me out . My messages — ”
70273	70281	70282	70282	She	30	“ You should n’t have come here . ”
70287	70293	70282	70282	She	30	“ What would Elizabeth say ? ”
70294	70306	70307	70307	He	32	“ I do n’t give a damn what she would say . ”
70359	70364	70335	70335	She	30	“ Why should I ? ”
70365	70379	70380	70380	He	32	“ Where is she ? Did you tell her you were coming here ? ”
70383	70399	70380	70380	He	32	“ No . I did n’t feel the need to inform her of my whereabouts . ”
70400	70409	70442	70442	his	32	“ But you — It does n’t matter . ”
70418	70428	70414	70414	she	30	“ If you wo n’t go , I will . ”
70429	70432	70433	70433	He	32	“ Wait . ”
70455	70460	70442	70442	his	32	“ Please , Maggie . ”
70461	70464	70465	70465	She	30	“ No . ”
70487	70493	70482	70482	she	30	“ Do n’t touch me . ”
70503	70531	70499	70499	he	32	“ I bought the farm for your parents . It ’s safe now . They can stay here , and you can come home to New York . ”
70537	70569	70534	70534	her	30	“ I ’m not going home , because it ’s not my home . This is . Not that city . New York is for people like you , not me . ”
70570	70573	70582	70582	his	32	“ But — ”
70585	70595	70582	70582	his	32	“ Did you listen to any of my messages ? ”
70634	70644	70645	70645	His	32	“ Yes . Every one of them . Twice . ”
70649	70662	70645	70645	His	32	“ And you still hate me , after all that I said ? ”
70717	70725	70726	70726	His	32	“ I ’m sorry I hurt you . ”
70730	70755	70726	70726	His	32	“ And I meant every word I said in those messages . I ’d do anything to go back . To do things differently . ”
70769	70779	70726	70726	His	32	“ Just go , Benjamin . It ’s over . ”
70780	70786	70790	70790	he	32	“ I — I see . ”
70811	70846	70807	70807	he	32	“ I ’m sorry , darling . I never meant to hurt you . Or to be like all the other guys in your life . And I never wanted you to hate me . ”
70859	70879	70847	70847	She	30	“ Go home , Benjamin . You do n’t belong here any more than I belong in the city . ”
70880	70894	70895	70895	He	32	“ Ca n’t you forgive me ? We could at least be friends . ”
70898	70912	70895	70895	He	32	“ I do n’t want to lose you completely , darling . Please . ”
70919	70922	70915	70915	her	30	“ No . ”
70923	70932	70933	70933	His	32	“ I ’m so fucking sorry , Maggie . ”
70949	70991	70938	70938	he	32	“ You were my one chance at happiness . My one shot at true love . Guess it just goes to show that guys like me do n’t deserve love , or happiness . And I certainly do n’t deserve you . ”
71154	71220	71221	71221	He	32	“ Hey . It ’s me again . I hope you ’re not mad at me for doing what I did . I figured if your parents were safe and settled , maybe you ’d be ready to come back home . You do n’t want to talk to me , and I was an asshole the last time you saw me , but I … ”
71230	71342	71221	71221	He	32	“ I miss you , Maggie . I miss you so damn much it hurts . I ’m alone again , and I should be used to that after being alone for years , but after having you in my life … I’m not . Come home to me . I ’ll be waiting . I ’ll wait for you forever , if that ’s what it takes . You know what ? Screw that . I ’m coming to you , and I ’m not leaving without you unless you tell me to . Even then , I wo n’t give up on you . I need you , darling . ”
71355	71435	71348	71348	she	1079	“ I ’m miserable without you , Maggie . I ’m even more of a beast than before . I ’m sorry my mother did what she did to you , and I ’m going to fix it . I ’m going to save your farm . It ’s not what you wanted , or what you expected , but I miss you . And I need you to come back to me and be mine again . Please . ”
72133	72156	72157	72157	he	32	“ I ’m coming back to you , and this time , I wo n’t leave until you love me , too , ”
72163	72177	72157	72157	he	32	“ And now I ’m talking to myself , like you . Perfect . ”
72196	72239	72240	72240	He	32	“ I should n’t have left yesterday . I should n’t have listened to you . You might hate me , and you might never want to see me again , but I ’m going to change that . Just watch me . ”
72247	72349	72240	72240	He	32	“ I miss you so much that I ’m talking to myself now . Yeah . You heard me right . So , guess what ? Tomorrow , I ’m getting back on a plane , and I ’m coming out there . I ’m going to find you , kiss you , and never let you go again . And I ’m going to make you love me as much as I love you , one way or another , even if it takes a million years . So … there . See you soon . Merry Christmas , darling . ”
72433	72443	72430	72430	he	1095	“ Andrew ? What are you doing out here ? ”
72444	72452	72453	72453	Andrew	51	“ I wanted to talk to you . ”
72468	72482	72483	72483	Benjamin	32	“ After what Mother pulled , I feel I owe you an explanation . ”
72486	72491	72483	72483	Benjamin	32	“ Yeah . Okay . ”
72492	72545	72546	72546	Benjamin	32	“ I never wanted to take your job , and when Mother had that dinner , I had no idea what I was walking into until it was too late . Next thing I know , she ’s talking about motions , and people were agreeing with her , and I froze . ”
72571	72576	72561	72561	people	1226	“ It ’s okay . ”
72577	72592	72593	72593	Andrew	51	“ But I never would have done it . You have to believe me . ”
72597	72634	72593	72593	Andrew	51	“ I would n’t have taken your job . You blame yourself for what happened with Father , but I never did . It happened quickly . It was n’t your fault you were n’t there . ”
72635	72644	72645	72645	Andrew	51	“ I know . And I believe you . ”
72648	72652	72645	72645	Andrew	51	“ You do ? ”
72653	72656	72657	72657	He	51	“ Yeah . ”
72664	72670	72657	72657	He	51	“ Oh , thank God . ”
72671	72681	72682	72682	Benjamin	32	“ All ’s well that ends well , right ? ”
72685	72688	72682	72682	Benjamin	32	“ Right . ”
72689	72698	72699	72699	he	32	“ Did she tell you her other secret ? ”
72707	72713	72702	72702	Andrew	51	“ No . What secret ? ”
72714	72723	72724	72724	He	51	“ Turns out , I ’m not hers . ”
72727	72757	72724	72724	He	51	“ I ’m his secretary ’s son . Dad had an affair , apparently , and got me out of it . Mother covered it up out of shame . ”
72763	72773	72724	72724	He	51	“ I had no idea . Are you okay ? ”
72774	72784	72785	72785	He	51	“ Yeah . If anything , I ’m happy . ”
72788	72802	72785	72785	He	51	“ It ’s not as if she loved me . She did n’t . ”
72803	72809	72810	72810	Andrew	51	“ That ’s not true , ”
72830	72847	72848	72848	Andrew	51	“ It does n’t matter , anyway . I ’m leaving soon , to find Maggie . ”
72852	72860	72848	72848	Andrew	51	“ Speaking of which , she ’s — ”
72861	72870	72871	72871	He	51	“ I ’m going to get her back . ”
72887	72929	72871	72871	He	51	“ No matter how far I have to go , or what I have to do , I will get her back , and she ’ll forgive me . I wo n’t live my life as miserable as our mother was . ”
72930	72946	72947	72947	Andrew	51	“ I bet it wo n’t be as hard as you might think , brother . ”
72954	72959	72947	72947	Andrew	51	“ Go get her . ”
72995	72998	73014	73014	They	1106	“ personally invited ”
73033	73040	73041	73042	a blonde	1107	“ I got you a whiskey , ”
73045	73050	73051	73052	a brunette	1108	“ Can we dance ? ”
73055	73061	73051	73052	a brunette	1108	“ I love this song . ”
73079	73087	73062	73062	He	51	“ I ’m sorry , but I — ”
73113	73116	73119	73119	her	30	“ Maggie . ”
73185	73188	73189	73189	he	51	“ Maggie , ”
73206	73209	73195	73195	she	30	“ Maggie . ”
73210	73218	73219	73220	A woman	229	“ No . My name ’s Julia . ”
73231	73235	73225	73225	her	229	“ Julia Edgerton . ”
73236	73242	73243	73243	He	51	“ Let go of me . ”
73261	73267	73280	73281	the crowd	711	“ I have to go . ”
73341	73345	73346	73346	he	51	“ My Maggie , ”
73464	73475	73457	73457	He	51	“ You ’re here . You came home to me . ”
73495	73504	73478	73478	her	229	“ Did you ever think I would n’t ? ”
73505	73510	73511	73511	He	51	“ Well … yeah . ”
73517	73530	73511	73511	He	51	“ After you sent me home alone , I kind of did . ”
73536	73559	73531	73531	She	229	“ Fair enough . I should n’t have sent you away . I lied . I had n’t listened to those messages . ”
73560	73563	73564	73564	He	51	“ Oh . ”
73640	73648	73649	73649	She	229	“ Are you still mad at me ? ”
73655	73658	73651	73651	her	229	“ Nope . ”
73659	73662	73663	73663	He	51	“ Good . ”
73667	73713	73714	73714	She	229	“ Can you forgive me for being an asshole that day ? I ’d just found out I lost everything — which was a lie , but I ’ll get to that later . And you were leaving , and I thought it was because — ”
73722	73770	73714	73714	She	229	“ I have no idea what you ’re talking about , but yes . I forgive you . Do you forgive me for believing your mother ’s lies in the first place , and for not telling you the whole story when you came to see me ? ”
73771	73774	73775	73775	He	51	“ Maggie … ”
73789	73795	73786	73786	she	229	“ What do you think ? ”
73796	73804	73805	73805	she	229	“ I think you should kiss me , ”
73822	73832	73813	73813	him	51	“ Darling ? I thought you ’d never ask . ”
73927	73935	73936	73936	he	51	“ I missed you so damn much , ”
73957	73993	73936	73936	he	51	“ Everything about you haunted me , killed me , hurt me . This all started with a lie , and was for pretend , but please do n’t ever leave me like that again . ”
74005	74015	73996	73996	her	229	“ I missed you , too . So much . ”
74016	74020	74021	74021	He	51	“ I lo — ”
74029	74049	74026	74026	his	51	“ Shit . Not here . There ’s so much to say . Will you come home with me ? ”
74055	74067	74052	74052	she	229	“ Yes . I ’ll go home with you , Benji . ”
74068	74074	74077	74077	his	51	“ Good . But first … ”
74080	74095	74077	74077	his	51	“ Maggie Donovan , will you do me the honor of being my girlfriend ? ”
74103	74112	74096	74096	She	229	“ No more fake fiancée or diamond rings ? ”
74113	74136	74137	74137	He	51	“ No . Mother and I had a little talk , and I went above her head about the stunt she pulled . ”
74152	74173	74137	74137	He	51	“ Needless to say , my position is currently very secure , and she got a slap on the wrist . ”
74174	74196	74197	74197	she	229	“ Should have gotten more . Or at the very least , I should ’ve been the one to do it , ”
74211	74219	74208	74208	she	229	“ Uh … I mean , good . ”
74220	74236	74237	74237	He	51	“ And next time I give you a ring , it ’ll be for real . ”
74249	74268	74237	74237	He	51	“ I want to spend the rest of my life with you . Loving you . Holding you . ”
74293	74316	74282	74282	He	51	“ Be mine , darling . For real this time . No more games . No lies . Just us . Together . ”
74317	74321	74322	74322	she	229	“ Just us , ”
74329	74334	74322	74322	she	229	“ Yes , Benji . ”
74392	74409	74379	74379	he	51	“ I ’ve never been so happy to hear that ridiculous name as I am now . ”
74410	74415	74421	74421	she	229	“ By the way ? ”
74427	74439	74421	74421	she	229	“ I ’m naked under this dress . Completely . Naked . ”
74475	74478	74480	74480	she	229	“ Maggie . ”
74574	74579	74580	74580	His	51	“ Home , Jeff . ”
74682	74696	74697	74697	He	51	“ I thought I ’d never get to touch you like this again . ”
74711	74724	74699	74699	his	51	“ I ’m so sorry I hurt you . So damn sorry . ”
74725	74730	74731	74731	She	229	“ It ’s okay . ”
74741	74753	74731	74731	She	229	“ We just had our first fight , that ’s all . ”
74770	74777	74754	74754	He	51	“ And we made it through . ”
74778	74781	74782	74782	She	229	“ Yep . ”
74789	74792	74782	74782	She	229	“ Together . ”
74796	74799	74793	74793	He	51	“ Together . ”
74800	74857	74754	74754	He	51	“ I ’m not saying it ’s going to be easy . I mean , we ’re still very different . And your mother is still going to hate me , and she ’ll still try to get you kicked out for picking me . And she ’ll still make our life a living hell because — ”
74858	74869	74870	74870	He	51	“ I do n’t give a damn . Not anymore . ”
74917	74928	74929	74929	Maggie	30	“ Besides , she ’s not even really my mother . ”
74934	74939	74929	74929	Maggie	30	“ Wait . What ? ”
74940	74948	74949	74949	He	51	“ I ’ll tell you the story . ”
74957	74979	74949	74949	He	51	“ But I do n’t want to talk about that now . All that matters is here and now . Us . ”
74990	74996	74980	74980	Her	30	“ But are you okay ? ”
74997	75007	75008	75008	He	51	“ I ’m fucking ecstatic because you ’re here . ”
75011	75078	75008	75008	He	51	“ I ’m not familiar with the emotion , but if you let me , I ’ll love you with all of my heart , mind , body , soul , and life . And even after that , I ’ll keep on loving you , darling . I swear it . I love you so damn much , Maggie . So . Damn . Much . ”
75083	75090	75079	75079	Her	30	“ You … you’re … I … ”
75091	75104	75105	75105	He	51	“ It ’s okay . I know it ’s quick and all . ”
75111	75131	75105	75105	He	51	“ You do n’t have to say anything back . I ’ll wait . I ’m a patient man . ”
75132	75135	75079	75079	Her	30	“ But — ”
75152	75159	75149	75149	her	30	“ I love you , too . ”
75163	75167	75160	75160	He	51	“ You do ? ”
75168	75172	75138	75138	her	30	“ I do . ”
75173	75178	75160	75160	He	51	“ Well , shit . ”
75189	75205	75206	75206	He	51	“ That officially makes me the happiest guy on earth . Where ’s my trophy ? ”
75214	75228	75229	75229	He	51	“ Oh . Right . She ’s here , in my arms already . ”
75243	75250	75229	75229	He	51	“ Say it again , darling . ”
75263	75270	75251	75251	She	30	“ I love you , Benji . ”
75271	75278	75256	75256	her	30	“ I love you , too . ”
75333	75339	75317	75317	He	51	“ You good , darling ? ”
75340	75345	75348	75348	him	51	“ Y - Yeah . ”
75354	75363	75348	75348	him	51	“ We ’re home , are n’t we ? ”
75411	75418	75398	75398	He	51	“ Yeah . We ’re home . ”
75538	75541	75546	75546	he	32	“ friendly . ”
75652	75654	75673	75673	her	30	“ mother ”
75785	75790	75771	75771	Maggie	30	“ Whatcha thinking about ? ”
75843	75854	75839	75841	a fucking farmer	1149	“ Have you ever thought about moving back out here ? ”
75855	75875	75876	75876	She	30	“ Yeah , sometimes . I mean , it ’s my home . Of course I think about it . ”
75879	75886	75876	75876	She	30	“ Why ? What ’s wrong ? ”
75887	75890	75891	75891	he	32	“ Nothing , ”
75919	75934	75909	75909	She	30	“ Nothing ’s wrong , and that ’s just what I was thinking about . ”
75943	75960	75935	75935	She	30	“ Do n’t worry , I ’m not going anywhere . You ’re stuck with me . ”
75961	75979	75980	75980	He	32	“ I do n’t think I ’d use the word ‘ stuck . ’ Blessed , maybe . ”
75996	76023	75980	75980	He	32	“ You make me so happy , Maggie . Happier than I ’d have ever thought possible , or even believed in . I love you . ”
76024	76031	76032	76032	she	30	“ I love you , too , ”
76094	76098	76099	76099	he	32	“ Watch yourself , ”
76107	76114	76115	76115	She	30	“ I ca n’t help it . ”
76126	76163	76115	76115	She	30	“ You might not be the beast anymore , but you ’re one hot beast in a flannel , jeans , and a five o’clock shadow . Who knew South Dakota would suit you so well ? ”
76205	76224	76225	76225	She	30	“ I can show you just how well it suits me , right now , in our room . ”
76233	76237	76225	76225	She	30	“ Oh … ? ”
76238	76241	76242	76242	He	32	“ Yeah . ”
76252	76264	76242	76242	He	32	“ I have something to show you outside first , though . ”
76270	76278	76242	76242	He	32	“ But it ’s snowing and freezing . ”
76279	76290	76291	76291	He	32	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll keep you warm . ”
76320	76325	76316	76316	he	32	“ Come with me ? ”
76326	76329	76330	76330	She	30	“ Okaaaay . ”
76347	76354	76330	76330	She	30	“ Let ’s go , then . ”
76457	76463	76464	76464	She	30	“ Are you feeling okay ? ”
76477	76484	76464	76464	She	30	“ You look a little green . ”
76485	76490	76491	76491	He	32	“ I ’m fine . ”
76505	76516	76519	76519	him	32	“ Come on . I want to show you something . ”
76561	76566	76542	76542	he	32	“ It ’s snowing . ”
76567	76570	76571	76571	She	30	“ Yeah . ”
76589	76602	76582	76582	her	30	“ What ’s going on ? Why are you acting so strange ? ”
76603	76626	76627	76627	He	32	“ Give me a second . I need to work it all out in my head . It has to be perfect . ”
76642	76649	76650	76650	She	30	“ You deserve perfect , darling . ”
76657	76660	76650	76650	She	30	“ Okaaaaaayyyyy . ”
76687	76741	76742	76742	She	30	“ This past year has been heaven , Maggie . Pure heaven . You gave me myself — and helped me remember the kind of man I wanted to be . A man who loved , and laughed , and lived . I love you so damn much . You have no idea . ”
76745	76754	76742	76742	She	30	“ I love you , too , Benji . ”
76755	76787	76788	76788	He	1160	“ But you do n’t understand . I did n’t really live until you . I existed as a shadow of myself , sure , but that ’s not the same . ”
76801	76818	76788	76788	He	1160	“ You taught me that , just like you taught me what real love feels like . ”
76846	76849	76826	76826	she	30	“ Benjamin … ”
76850	76865	76866	76866	He	1160	“ You are my everything . My life . My love . My heart . ”
76880	76889	76890	76890	She	30	“ Do you know what this tree is ? ”
76896	76951	76890	76890	She	30	“ Then you know that your father brought your mother out here , when they first started dating , and they planted the tree together . He told her that the tree would grow , like his love for her , and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her . ”
76972	76996	76997	76997	She	30	“ This is where he asked her to marry him . The tree was a lot smaller , but you get the idea . ”
77002	77007	76997	76997	She	30	“ Oh my God . ”
77008	77045	77046	77046	He	1160	“ Maggie Louise Donovan , you have made me the happiest man on this earth , so I might be getting greedy now , asking for more , but I ’m going to do it anyway . ”
77067	77143	77144	77144	She	30	“ You are the one person I never have to wonder about , the one person I always want by my side . Will you make me an even happier man and agree to be my wife ? To spend the rest of our lives together — here or in New York , I do n’t give a damn , as long as I have you — loving one another ? No matter what comes ? ”
77194	77205	77188	77188	she	30	“ I love you . I love you so much . ”
77209	77218	77188	77188	she	30	“ But you still have to answer me . ”
77219	77223	77224	77224	She	30	“ Oh my — ”
77231	77243	77244	77244	She	30	“ Well , I can only think of one appropriate reply . ”
77262	77272	77273	77273	She	30	“ I thought you ’d never ask , Benji . ”
77322	77341	77310	77310	She	30	“ I ca n’t believe you knew about this tree . How did you find out about it ? ”
77342	77351	77352	77352	He	1162	“ Like a wise person once told me … ”
77375	77381	77382	77382	She	30	“ Research . Always research . ”
77387	77394	77382	77382	She	30	“ I love you , Benji . ”
77395	77409	77410	77410	He	1162	“ I love you , too . And I meant what I said . ”
77420	77465	77410	77410	He	1162	“ I ’ll move out here with you , if that ’s what you want . We can be farmers and live here and keep the family business going . This farm means a lot to your family — and to me , too . ”
77466	77473	77382	77382	She	30	“ What about your family business ? ”
77474	77501	77502	77502	He	1162	“ That does n’t seem as important as it did a year ago . Probably because my mother is n’t really my family . You are . ”
77512	77517	77502	77502	He	1162	“ I love you . ”
77526	77533	77518	77518	She	1164	“ I love you , too . ”
77534	77538	77502	77502	He	1162	“ Read it . ”
77539	77542	77543	77543	She	1164	“ What ? ”
77556	77566	77543	77543	She	1164	“ Forever yours , for all time , Benji . ”
77644	77665	77638	77638	he	1162	“ Seeing that on you … it does things to me , darling . I was alone for so long . ”
77666	77675	77676	77676	She	1164	“ You ’re not alone . Not anymore . ”
77690	77695	77676	77676	She	1164	“ And never again . ”
77696	77701	77702	77702	He	1162	“ Because of you . ”
77712	77717	77708	77708	Hers	1164	“ Because of us . ”
