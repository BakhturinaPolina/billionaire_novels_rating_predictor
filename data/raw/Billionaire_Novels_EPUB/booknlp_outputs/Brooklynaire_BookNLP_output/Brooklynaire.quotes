4537	4555	4534	4534	I	0	“ But I do n’t need to play hockey , Nate . It ’s a desk job . ”

5043	5048	5039	5039	he	121	“ Wh - what ? ”
5070	5085	5052	5052	I	0	“ Alternate universes . The multiverse . It ’s a legitimate theory in physics . ”
5086	5095	5096	5096	Nate	121	“ Pfft . Renny just reads science fiction . ”
5101	5132	5096	5096	Nate	121	“ Because science fiction is awesome . The multiverse theory posits that infinity is large enough to simultaneously encompass every parallel chance . Every non - choice . Every possibility . ”
5133	5160	5161	5161	Nate	121	“ Well , that ’s just scary ! Please do n’t send me to a planet where my brother - in - law runs your company . ”
5164	5199	5161	5161	Nate	121	“ But I do like the idea that there ’s a universe in which I did not step out onto the ice yesterday and then mess up our end - of - season workflow . ”
5204	5223	5200	5200	His	121	“ It ’s going to be okay , Bec . What ’s a little more chaos between friends ? ”

5251	5254	5255	5255	his	121	“ Hey , ”
5277	5288	5260	5260	He	121	“ Would you tell me if you were n’t okay ? ”
5289	5292	5255	5255	his	121	“ Yes . ”
5298	5309	5255	5255	his	121	“ In a few days I ’ll probably feel great . ”
5310	5340	5260	5260	He	121	“ I hope so . Besides — the team still has to get us there . My model predicts we ’ll clinch our playoffs spot a week from tonight . ”
5341	5348	5349	5349	I	0	“ In this universe , right ? ”
5352	5357	5358	5358	he	121	“ Listen , bitch , ”

5419	5424	5260	5260	He	121	“ Listen , bitch ! ”
5458	5467	5468	5468	I	0	“ Clinching the playoffs next week , huh ? ”
5476	5484	5468	5468	I	0	“ I ’d better chill the champagne . ”
5485	5492	5493	5493	His	121	“ That ’s more like it . ”
5524	5544	5493	5493	His	121	“ Are you going to be able to get the peace and quiet here that you need to heal ? ”
5545	5551	5552	5552	I	0	“ It ’ll be fine , ”
5555	5567	5552	5552	I	0	“ We ’re usually not all home at the same time . ”
5589	5599	5585	5585	Nate	121	“ You ’ll call me if you need anything ? ”
5600	5604	5605	5605	I	0	“ Of course , ”
5675	5696	5667	5667	him	121	“ Be well , Bec . Do n’t try to do too much before the doctors say it ’s okay . ”
5697	5704	5705	5705	He	121	“ All right . I promise . ”
6388	6391	6392	6392	he	491	“ Fuck ! ”
6395	6398	6399	6401	the other player	493	“ Switch ! ”

6530	6538	6539	6539	Nate	121	“ Dude , you have a visitor . ”
6762	6766	6767	6771	the Ping - Pong player	497	“ Holy shit , ”
6797	6819	6786	6787	The guy	505	“ Did you just write a shorter algo for determining the range of our … Holy shit ! That ’s epic . ”
6828	6852	6820	6820	Nate	121	“ I just saved you about three days of coding . How about you buy lunch ? It ’s your turn , anyway . ”
6853	6874	6875	6875	Nate	121	“ Fine . But I ’m in the mood for Chinese . Now greet your guest , you rude fucker . ”
6991	6997	6982	6982	he	121	“ Wait , you ’re … ”
7020	7025	7026	7028	the other guy	510	“ … Rebecca Rowley , ”
7051	7057	7038	7038	He	510	“ Here ’s her résumé . ”
7064	7070	7071	7071	Rebecca	141	“ Nice to meet you , ”
7085	7096	7071	7071	Rebecca	141	“ I heard you were looking for an office manager . ”
7121	7139	7097	7097	Nate	121	“ We are n’t very good at the corporate stuff . It ’s time , I guess . ”
7140	7146	7151	7151	He	121	“ It ’s past time , ”
7159	7174	7151	7151	He	121	“ I ’m Stew . You ’re the one Henry sent over , right ? ”
7175	7178	7151	7151	He	121	“ Right . ”
7179	7184	7185	7185	He	121	“ Good , good . ”
7189	7200	7185	7185	He	121	“ Interview her . Ten minutes . We need this . ”
7329	7339	7340	7340	he	121	“ Let ’s find you a place to sit , ”
7394	7399	7400	7400	he	121	“ Have a seat , ”
7430	7475	7417	7417	He	121	“ There are seven of us . Stewie handles all the money stuff . But the office itself is kind of a free - for - all . Phones are n’t always answered . People come and go . Our files are a disaster . ”
7493	7516	7517	7517	Nate	121	“ We all work at least forty hours on - site , but not the same forty hours . It ’s flexible , ”
7530	7551	7552	7552	He	121	“ What ’s your availability ? You , uh , probably sent me a cover letter with this résumé but … ”
7562	7567	7568	7568	she	517	“ Full - time , ”
7572	7588	7568	7568	she	517	“ I can take whatever hours you give me . And I ’m available immediately . ”
7595	7598	7599	7599	he	121	“ Awesome , ”
7622	7628	7615	7615	he	121	“ If I may ask … ”
7634	7650	7631	7631	his	121	“ Why the sudden availability ? Seems like you were in school until last month . ”
7651	7654	7655	7655	she	517	“ Right , ”
7659	7678	7655	7655	she	517	“ My father died two months ago . It makes more sense for me to be working now . ”
7679	7682	7683	7683	he	121	“ Oh , ”
7688	7694	7683	7683	he	121	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
7721	7744	7715	7715	She	517	“ Thank you , but I ’m fine and ready to work . Your messy office does n’t scare me , mister . ”
7785	7807	7773	7774	Nate Kattenberger	121	“ We definitely need the help . It ’s not a very structured environment . Maybe you could work on that . ”
7845	7848	7849	7849	Rebecca	121	“ Oh ! ”
7882	7895	7896	7896	His	121	“ They ’re all palindromes . Your T - shirt , too . ”
7900	7922	7923	7923	he	121	“ Good eye . Palindromes are a thing with me . My fiancée made the wall mural . Do you code ? ”
7927	7932	7923	7923	he	121	“ No ! Sorry . ”
7936	7957	7923	7923	he	121	“ But palindromes have been around for centuries . Even in ancient Greece . Literature is kind of my thing . ”
7962	7967	7968	7968	Nate	121	“ Literature , huh ? ”
7973	7983	7968	7968	Nate	121	“ Right . I was majoring in comparative lit . ”
8087	8096	8097	8097	Nate	121	“ What else should I know about you ? ”
8100	8107	8108	8108	she	517	“ I ’m a good worker , ”
8112	8124	8108	8108	she	517	“ I had a three - point - nine grade average … ”
8125	8133	8136	8136	he	121	“ Which class gave you the B ? ”
8143	8166	8167	8167	He	121	“ Bio lab . But in my defense , the course description did n’t say anything about dissecting a pig ’s eye . ”
8181	8197	8198	8198	She	517	“ I ’m , um , very reliable . There ’s a stack of references … ”
8242	8248	8232	8232	Nate	121	“ Any questions for me ? ”
8253	8266	8267	8267	He	121	“ What do you need your office assistant to do , primarily ? ”
8273	8345	8267	8267	He	121	“ I ’ve never had an assistant before . So we ’ll have to figure it out as we go . But we ’re gearing up for a big trade show in March . We ’ll need to make posters and crap . We need a schedule , and a new website for the company . We need to hire an advertising agency . That all sounds pretty time - consuming … ”
8364	8370	8371	8371	she	536	“ That all sounds doable , ”
8374	8388	8371	8371	she	536	“ I could help organize all those projects . Keep things on track . ”
8395	8408	8389	8389	Nate	121	“ Sorry . Sometimes I do n’t pay attention when people talk . ”
8448	8462	8463	8463	he	121	“ … But I always make time for my mom and my fiancée , ”
8467	8493	8463	8463	he	121	“ Her name is Juliet . The fiancée , that is . Mom is Linda . Their calls always matter . Everyone else can wait . ”
8542	8556	8530	8530	Stew	142	“ How ’s it going over here ? Are you making plans already ? ”
8557	8561	8562	8562	Nate	121	“ Seems so , ”
8565	8571	8572	8572	He	121	“ I was just telling … ”
8581	8584	8585	8585	she	537	“ Rebecca , ”
8594	8603	8604	8604	Nate	121	“ … All that needs to be done , ”
8609	8647	8648	8648	he	121	“ Like , we take turns paying for lunch , because that ’s the only way we remember to eat . Someone should formalize the rotation . Somehow it ’s always my turn . But if we — ”
8652	8677	8650	8650	his	121	“ — could finish the fucking beta of version three by the next month , I ’ll buy lunch every day for two weeks . ”
8703	8732	8698	8698	Nate	121	“ Okay , Rebecca . You can start whenever . There are probably some forms you ’ll have to fill out . Stewie will know what they are . ”
8733	8737	8738	8738	Her	537	“ Employment forms ? ”
8749	8755	8738	8738	Her	537	“ W-4 ? And I-9 ? ”
8765	8768	8769	8769	He	121	“ Right . ”
8773	8785	8769	8769	He	121	“ Good stuff . Stew ? Can you make that happen ? ”
8817	8820	8821	8821	Stew	142	“ Dude , ”
8828	8841	8821	8821	Stew	142	“ Hold up . There ’s a few details you skipped over . ”
8850	8853	8854	8854	Stew	142	“ Salary , ”
8866	8872	8863	8863	Stew	142	“ What about stock options ? ”
8878	8886	8873	8873	Nate	121	“ Nah . Not for clerical staff . ”
8932	8962	8963	8963	He	121	“ Okay . I have to get back to work . But your first job is to order yourself a computer . Matty will give you our vendor login . ”
8974	8987	8963	8963	He	121	“ And fill out those forms . Welcome aboard , Rebecca Rowley . ”
9041	9050	9058	9058	She	137	“ This is as far as I go , ”
9110	9114	9115	9115	I	0	“ Fair enough , ”
9119	9129	9130	9130	She	137	“ I ’ll only be a couple of minutes . ”
9412	9416	9417	9417	I	0	“ You guys , ”
9429	9441	9417	9417	I	0	“ You ’re killing it , and I ’m so impressed . ”

They ’re pretty sure they can knock you out of the playoffs in the next two games . And with twenty - thousand of their fans screaming at you in the stadium , it would be tempting to believe them . But you ’re not going to . ”

10559	10611	10552	10552	Lauren	137	“ Maybe it ’s because you ’ve been friends since your drunken college days ? I did n’t ask . She did n’t offer . Is there a reason you would n’t want to see Alex ? If so , throwing a party with her was kind of a strange choice . ”

10805	10823	10824	10824	Lauren	137	“ All right . Or — here ’s a novel idea — you could bring a date . ”

And when I told you so , not three minutes ago , when you were staring down the hallway , you grunted like that was fine ! But it ’s not fine .

15316	15320	15321	15321	Nate	121	“ Thank you , ”
15327	15333	15321	15321	Nate	121	“ That would be perfect . ”
15334	15343	15344	15345	Mrs. Gray	159	“ It ’s only perfect if Rebecca agrees , ”
15348	15362	15344	15345	Mrs. Gray	159	“ I can make her a sandwich if that menu does n’t suit . ”
15363	15370	15371	15371	I	0	“ Soup and salad sound lovely , ”
15375	15379	15380	15380	Nate	121	“ Mrs. Gray ? ”
15390	15412	15380	15380	Nate	121	“ Rebecca is going to be staying here for a little while . I ’ll put her in the green bedroom . ”
15413	15416	15417	15417	I	0	“ What ? ”
15437	15442	15443	15443	Nate	121	“ Hear me out , ”
15476	15516	15464	15464	Nate	121	“ Your apartment is too noisy . This house has six bedrooms . I ’m headed to Washington DC tomorrow . You ’ll have complete privacy . Give it a week . See if the quiet helps you rest . ”
15524	15531	15582	15582	his	121	“ I ca n’t stay here . ”
15536	15540	15464	15464	Nate	121	“ Why not ? ”
15541	15553	15554	15554	I	0	“ Well , I just ca n’t , that ’s all . ”
15572	15578	15579	15579	Nate	121	“ You ’re my boss . ”
15585	15607	15582	15582	his	121	“ I did n’t ask you as your employer . I asked as your friend . Just tell me one thing . ”
15608	15611	15554	15554	I	0	“ What ? ”
15612	15634	15582	15582	his	121	“ If I was injured and scared and not sleeping well , would you offer me one of your six bedrooms ? ”
15635	15640	15582	15582	his	121	“ Well , sure . ”
15658	15661	15662	15662	He	121	“ Good . ”
15680	15687	15688	15688	he	121	“ Then let ’s eat lunch , ”
15911	15914	15900	15900	he	121	“ Nathan , ”
15926	15931	15915	15916	Mrs. Gray	159	“ Phubbing is rude . ”
15932	15935	15936	15936	he	121	“ Phubbing ? ”
15942	15981	15936	15936	he	121	“ Phone snubbing . God knows you usually dine alone , when it does n’t matter . But Rebecca is your once - a - millennium guest , and the least you could do is talk to her . ”
16004	16021	16022	16022	He	121	“ Thank you for your input , but I ’m trying to help Becca with something . ”
16032	16045	16022	16022	He	121	“ Is Dr. Evan Armitage on the board of any charitable organizations ? ”
16056	16068	16069	16069	He	121	“ Ah , this is just what I was looking for . ”
16134	16145	16112	16112	He	121	“ Bec , what ’s that busy doctor ’s number ? ”
16146	16150	16151	16151	I	0	“ Hold on . ”
16163	16169	16151	16151	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
16170	16179	16180	16180	He	121	“ I ’m getting your appointment date changed . ”
16185	16193	16180	16180	He	121	“ How are you going to … ? ”
16194	16197	16198	16198	Nate	121	“ Yes , ”
16204	16270	16198	16198	Nate	121	“ I think you can help me . This is Nate Kattenberger calling for Dr. Armitage . Could you let him know that I ’ve just donated $ 50,000 to the Concussion Legacy Foundation ? It ’s my gift to honor the doctor ’s work with athletes . If he ’d like to discuss the matter further , I ’m available at the following number … ”
16271	16276	16277	16277	I	0	“ What on earth ? ”
16289	16298	16299	16299	Nate	121	“ Do n’t get all stressy , Bec . ”
16309	16351	16299	16299	Nate	121	“ I like that charity . Dr. Armitage chose well when he got involved with them . And , hey , professional sports teams are too cavalier about head injuries . I should have given them money a long time ago . ”
16352	16355	16356	16356	Nate	121	“ But … ”
16364	16371	16372	16372	He	121	“ That was speedy . Hello ? ”
16377	16442	16443	16443	Nate	121	“ Yes , Doctor , this is he . Indeed I did . You ’re right , I do own a hockey team … That ’s the one ! Concussion research is very important to me . Seemed like as good a time as any to make a contribution … Right . It ’s such an important topic . More so now than ever . ”
16460	16470	16471	16471	Nate	121	“ I ’m with you , a hundred percent , ”
16479	16528	16471	16471	Nate	121	“ In fact , there ’s someone sitting here beside me who really needs some assistance with a head injury . We ’d like to see you sooner rather than later . Unfortunately , your front office thinks that a June appointment is the best you can do . ”
16553	16562	16563	16563	Nate	121	“ Oh , terrific . That ’s perfect , ”
16569	16597	16598	16598	Nate	121	“ Sunday morning at ten , then . The patient ’s name is Rebecca Rowley . She ’ll be there . Thanks very much . Bye now . ”
16607	16623	16605	16605	himself	121	“ The good doctor is seeing you on a Sunday ! Now that ’s service . ”
16637	16654	16655	16655	Nate	121	“ Tell me you did n’t shake down the specialist to get me an appointment time ? ”
16672	16699	16665	16665	He	121	“ Nah . I ’m pretty sure a shakedown would be if someone took his money . This was , like , the opposite of that . ”
16700	16717	16718	16718	My	0	“ Fifty . Thousand . Dollars ? I can not believe you just gave that away … ”
16735	16744	16745	16745	He	121	“ Well , technically I did n’t yet . ”
16762	16803	16745	16745	He	121	“ Robert — this is Nate . Please donate fifty - thousand dollars to the Concussion Legacy Foundation before the close of business today . This is from the personal account — not the corporate foundation . Thanks , man . ”
16804	16807	16808	16808	I	0	“ Nate ! ”
16816	16857	16811	16811	He	121	“ It ’s a good cause , Bec . The best . The owner of a hockey team is supposed to care about concussion research . And you need an appointment with him . It ’s a win - win . ”
16858	16863	16864	16864	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
16978	16981	16982	16982	Nate	121	“ Hey . ”
17007	17023	16989	16989	he	121	“ Becca . Everything is going to be okay . You know that , right ? ”
17026	17035	17036	17036	I	0	“ It ’s sort of hard to picture , ”
17095	17103	17082	17082	He	121	“ You ’re so tight . Jeez . ”
17244	17248	17249	17249	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
17273	17290	17261	17261	Nate	121	“ Let me show you upstairs real quick . You need to know how everything works . ”
17432	17439	17440	17440	he	121	“ Down there is my room , ”
17454	17462	17465	17465	him	121	“ And you ’ll stay in here . ”
17477	17491	17465	17465	him	121	“ Wow , Nate . This looks like Her Royal Majesty ’s chambers . ”
17492	17497	17440	17440	he	121	“ Which Royal Majesty ? ”
17498	17506	17507	17507	Nate	121	“ The Queen of France . Duh . ”
17544	17550	17440	17440	he	121	“ This room is crazy . ”
17551	17591	17592	17592	I	0	“ I do n’t want to put you on the third floor . You should n’t be climbing too much if you ’re unsteady . And this is a nice room . My parents stay here when they visit . ”
17622	17646	17617	17617	I	0	“ Now let me show you the den . It ’s my main living space , and you can make yourself at home . ”
17783	17786	17787	17787	I	0	“ Wow , ”
17797	17807	17811	17811	he	723	“ This is my favorite room in the house . ”
17825	17830	17811	17811	he	723	“ Hello , Nate , ”
17836	17842	17811	17811	he	723	“ Can I help you ? ”
17843	17849	17850	17850	Nate	121	“ Not now , Hal , ”
17853	17858	17859	17859	I	0	“ That was … ? ”
17862	17868	17869	17869	Nate	121	“ Not a real person , ”
17875	17878	17869	17869	Nate	121	“ Hal … ”
17879	17882	17883	17884	the machine	729	“ Yes ? ”
17888	17900	17901	17901	Nate	121	“ … Is the voice of a product I ’m testing , ”
17904	17932	17901	17901	Nate	121	“ I ’m trying to improve on the quality of smart speakers . They all suck , but Hal uses deep learning to quickly become more conversant . ”
17933	17937	17938	17938	I	0	“ Deep learning , ”
17942	17947	17938	17938	I	0	“ Like , AI ? ”
17948	17953	17954	17954	he	121	“ Exactly like AI , ”
17964	17994	17954	17954	he	121	“ He ’s a secret , by the way . Hal is one of the things covered by the specs of your KTech nondisclosure agreement . Yada yada yada . ”
17995	17999	18000	18000	I	0	“ Got it , ”
18029	18089	18019	18019	I	0	“ The products on the market right now are all pretty dumb . But Hal is pretty sharp . So if you ask him for something and he does n’t respond correctly , just try again with slightly different words . And do n’t hold back on the slang because I want him to learn how people really speak . ”
18113	18131	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Wait — you gave him the creepy computer voice from that Space Odyssey movie , right ? ”
18136	18161	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Just having a little fun . But he can do any kind of voice . How do you think the butler should sound ? ”
18162	18173	18174	18174	Nate	121	“ Like a Jane Austen character . Charming and solicitous . ”
18179	18195	18174	18174	Nate	121	“ Like — what’s - his - name , the Colin Firth character ? Darcy ? ”
18196	18215	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ No way . Darcy did n’t like to talk . You need the other guy — Bingley . ”
18216	18223	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Fine . Hey , Hal ? ”
18224	18229	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Yes , Nate , ”
18234	18241	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Your new name is Bingley . ”
18242	18248	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Bingley at your service , ”
18254	18291	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ And I want you to use a different voice . Male . British accent . Blueblood . That means well - educated . Incorporate the sentence structure of Pride and Prejudice , by Jane Austen . ”
18292	18297	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Certainly , sir ! ”
18308	18316	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ How may I be of service ? ”
18317	18323	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Say hello to Rebecca . ”
18324	18336	18337	18337	Nate	121	“ Greetings , fair one ! Let me hear your voice . ”
18341	18357	18337	18337	Nate	121	“ He needs to hear you so he ’ll know to obey when you speak . ”
18358	18365	18132	18132	Nate	121	“ Uh . Hi , Bingley . ”
18373	18379	18337	18337	Nate	121	“ I ’m Rebecca Rowley . ”
18380	18394	18395	18395	Nate	121	“ At your service , miss ! You may ask anything of me . ”
18412	18423	18410	18410	him	121	“ Um , what is the capital of Burkina Faso ? ”
18424	18427	18337	18337	Nate	121	“ Ouagadougou . ”
18428	18432	18433	18433	Nate	121	“ Too easy , ”
18436	18444	18433	18433	Nate	121	“ Even Siri could get that right . ”
18447	18456	18433	18433	Nate	121	“ Who makes the best pizza in Brooklyn ? ”
18457	18464	18465	18465	Bingley	139	“ If you are feeling peckish , ”
18470	18503	18465	18465	Bingley	139	“ Grimaldi ’s is seven - tenths of a mile away , with a very high rating . Diners tend to recommend the white pie with garlic or the Buffalo chicken pizza . ”
18504	18507	18508	18508	I	0	“ No , ”
18511	18521	18508	18508	I	0	“ Buffalo chicken on a pizza is just wrong . ”
18522	18531	18532	18532	Bingley	139	“ I will make a note of it , ”
18536	18547	18548	18548	Nate	121	“ Miss Rebecca does not prefer spicy chicken on pizza . ”
18555	18573	18574	18574	he	121	“ Bingley — Rebecca will be staying with us a while to recover from a head injury , ”
18577	18597	18574	18574	he	121	“ If she asks you to keep silent , please do n’t speak until she calls you by name . ”
18598	18619	18653	18653	Bingley	139	“ She ’s feeling ill ? Heavens ! Take care , Miss Rebecca . I sha n’t be a bother ! ”
18620	18626	18627	18627	I	0	“ Thank you , Bingley , ”
18669	18672	18673	18673	Nate	121	“ So . ”
18679	18737	18673	18673	Nate	121	“ Bingley controls the security system . Tonight , when Mrs. Gray leaves , all you have to do is ask him to lock the place up . He ’ll take care of everything . And if you leave the house , he ’ll let you back in . Bingley — take Rebecca ’s fingerprint , please . ”
18743	18757	18673	18673	Nate	121	“ Miss Rebecca , deign to place your fair finger on the screen . ”
18788	18799	18781	18781	Bingley	139	“ Please choose a four - digit number , miss . ”
18800	18803	18804	18804	I	0	“ 7854 , ”
18819	18863	18816	18816	Nate	121	“ Something to know — the keypad on the front door uses both your fingerprint and the number code . The fingerprint is sufficient , but if anyone is watching you enter the code , he wo n’t know that the fingerprint matters . ”
18864	18879	18880	18880	Bingley	139	“ We ca n’t have highwaymen snatching you off the street for your fingerprint , ”
18894	18899	18880	18880	Bingley	139	“ That ’s disturbing . ”
18903	18908	18900	18900	Nate	121	“ Quiet , Bingley . ”
18909	18920	18921	18921	I	0	“ Nate , we do n’t have to do this , ”
18924	18932	18921	18921	I	0	“ I can just go home and … ”
18933	18936	18937	18937	he	139	“ Hey ! ”
18946	18982	18937	18937	he	139	“ Let ’s just try it . You need the rest . Do n’t argue or I ’ll upload Bingley to your phone and get him to nag your family into giving you more peace . ”
18992	19002	18986	18986	he	139	“ But I do n’t have my things here … ”
19003	19011	19012	19012	He	139	“ It ’ll be taken care of . ”
19018	19049	19012	19012	He	139	“ I ’ve got to run or Lauren will flay me alive for fucking up the afternoon schedule . Mrs. Gray will make you dinner before she leaves . Later ! ”
19050	19055	19056	19056	Bingley	139	“ Goodbye , Nate , ”
19059	19074	19056	19056	Bingley	139	“ You ’re a prince among men ! You ’re smarter than Bill Gates ! ”

20120	20147	20117	20117	she	754	“ I need you to stay on top of your calls for the next two months . Otherwise my life will be hell during your honeymoon . ”
20148	20155	20156	20156	Nate	121	“ We ca n’t have that . ”
20189	20199	20181	20181	Rebecca	121	“ How long am I going to be away ? ”
20200	20226	20227	20227	He	121	“ Ten days , accounting for travel . And we ’re not scheduling anything on your first day back , so you can catch up . ”
20230	20244	20227	20227	He	121	“ It ’s over Labor Day , though . The timing is perfect . ”

20299	20307	20288	20289	the man	386	“ What ’s next on my schedule ? ”
20308	20315	20316	20316	He	121	“ The weekend ? Remember those ? ”
20320	20331	20316	20316	He	121	“ Your personal calendar says something like dinner with Bart . ”
20332	20337	20338	20338	He	121	“ Does it really ? ”
20355	20361	20362	20362	Rebecca	121	“ I ’m pretty sure , ”

20394	20436	20441	20441	Rebecca	121	“ Some friend of Juliet ’s from her new gym . A jock who never shuts up about nutrition and his competitive edge . But Juliet is a CrossFit disciple now , so she finds it more interesting than I do . ”
20437	20440	20441	20441	Rebecca	121	“ Oh . ”
20666	20673	20674	20674	Nate	121	“ Maybe I ’ll leave early , ”
20683	20686	20674	20674	Nate	121	“ Early ? ”
20697	20709	20687	20687	Rebecca	121	“ That ’s possible ? How does it work , exactly ? ”
20734	20779	20780	20780	Nate	121	“ I ’m starving . And I need a beer . Maybe I can get Juliet to get a couple drinks with me before dinner . And appetizers . Bart is the kind of tool who will make us eat at a vegan restaurant . ”
20790	20800	20780	20780	Nate	121	“ … And I do n’t think he drinks . ”
20812	20820	20821	20821	Rebecca	121	“ Lager , sir , is regal , ”

21589	21617	21574	21574	she	805	“ One shot just for a warm - up . Then we find you a hotel room before we ’re too drunk to Google the phone number . ”
21636	21643	21631	21631	his	121	“ Bec , it ’s official . ”
21656	21666	21644	21644	Nate	121	“ You are the employee of the fucking decade . ”
21720	21726	21727	21727	she	805	“ Drink up , sailor , ”
21730	21744	21727	21727	she	805	“ I ’m going to get you a room at the Soho Grand . ”
21750	21753	21745	21745	He	121	“ Cheers . ”
21771	21777	21761	21761	she	805	“ So . Cat tacos ? ”
21778	21782	21789	21789	she	805	“ Cat … ? ”
21799	21807	21789	21789	she	805	“ Have you been saving that one ? ”
21808	21832	21833	21833	He	121	“ For weeks . There are n’t any tacos in this neighborhood . So I finally just decided that empanadas were close enough . ”
22297	22307	22308	22308	she	145	“ Oh Nate . You make me so happy , ”
22399	22408	22409	22409	she	145	“ It only happened a couple of times , ”
22421	22440	22409	22409	she	145	“ But you ’re at work all the time . It is n’t fun being a tech widow . ”
22441	22454	22483	22483	Juliet	145	“ Because I ’m trying to clear my calendar for our honeymoon ! ”
22486	22511	22483	22483	Juliet	145	“ I went to that gym because I felt bad about my belly fat . But it changed the way I look at myself . ”
22512	22520	22521	22521	I	0	“ You were just as beautiful before , ”
22542	22557	22558	22558	she	145	“ But I never thought a guy like Bart would look twice at me , ”
22570	22576	22558	22558	she	145	“ A guy like Bart , ”
22657	22662	22655	22655	they	2985	“ we grew apart . ”
22668	22674	22675	22675	I	0	“ Take care of yourself , ”

22779	22805	22772	22772	Stewie	143	“ It ’s time to get back out there . You know that ‘ married to your job ’ is just a saying , right ? ”
22914	22934	22935	22935	They	2985	“ A single , rich guy like you ? There must be a line of women around the block . ”
23368	23379	23364	23365	Mrs. Gray	159	“ My Christian is n’t a fan of Mexican food , ”
23385	23395	23364	23365	Mrs. Gray	159	“ He does n’t have a taste for spices . ”
23396	23401	23402	23402	Becca	121	“ Wait a minute , ”
23405	23415	23402	23402	Becca	121	“ Your husband ’s name is … Christian Gray ? ”
23416	23421	23364	23365	Mrs. Gray	159	“ That ’s right . ”
23422	23425	23426	23426	Rebecca	121	“ But … ”
23429	23440	23426	23426	Rebecca	121	“ There are books about a guy named Christian Gray — ”
23441	23457	23364	23365	Mrs. Gray	159	“ I know , dear ! I read the first one aloud to my husband . ”
23458	23461	23462	23462	Rebecca	121	“ Really ? ”
23477	23526	23462	23462	Rebecca	121	“ Absolutely ! When I showed him the lad ’s name in the book , he was curious . And when I got to the saucy bits he insisted I keep reading . ‘ Ca n’t let a pretend fellow have all the fun , ’ he said . ”
23589	23601	23569	23570	my housekeeper	898	“ Mrs. Gray , you did n’t have to stay late . ”
23602	23623	23624	23624	she	898	“ I had a nice chat with the lovely Rebecca , while my Christian is bowling tonight with the boys , ”
23633	23654	23624	23624	she	898	“ He ’s always in a frowsy mood after some pints with his mates . I ’d better hurry home . ”
23732	23740	23741	23741	she	159	“ Here ’s your portion , Nate , ”
23744	23754	23741	23741	she	159	“ Now I must run , too . Toodles ! ”
23777	23784	23785	23785	Rebecca	121	“ Mrs. Gray is something else , ”
23795	23803	23789	23789	she	159	“ I could n’t eat another bite . ”
23804	23814	23815	23815	I	0	“ You look better than you did this morning , ”
23846	23852	23853	23853	Rebecca	121	“ I should hope so . ”
23860	23871	23853	23853	Rebecca	121	“ Sleeping for five hours ought to have some benefit . ”
23872	23881	23882	23882	I	0	“ Five ? Wow . Rebecca Van Winkle . ”
23926	23930	23931	23931	Becca	121	“ You know … ”
23940	23961	23931	23931	Becca	121	“ I did n’t know I was so tired . And it is really quiet here . You were right . ”
23962	23965	23966	23966	I	0	“ Mmm , ”
23993	23999	23987	23987	I	0	“ Did your luggage arrive ? ”
24000	24003	24004	24004	Rebecca	121	“ Hey , ”
24011	24035	24004	24004	Rebecca	121	“ The luggage thing was a little heavy - handed . My sister left me text messages asking if I ’d been kidnapped . ”
24036	24041	24042	24042	I	0	“ Oh , please . ”
24060	24092	24042	24042	I	0	“ Ramesh said she was all too happy to help . In fact , Missy asked him to move the crib into your room to give her a little more space . ”
24093	24099	24100	24100	Becca	121	“ Of course she did . ”
24103	24135	24100	24100	Becca	121	“ Nate , this is silly . I can just go home . I ’m better rested already . If you ’ve reconsidered your invitation , I wo n’t be offended . ”
24156	24186	24144	24144	I	0	“ Stay , Bec . I ’m off to DC in the morning , anyway . Get a couple of decent nights ’ sleep . It ’s good medicine . ”
24187	24191	24192	24192	she	906	“ Thank you , ”

24395	24424	24392	24392	I	0	“ I wish . But I ’m not supposed to drink . Or read . Or watch TV . Or put myself in the position of being jostled . ”
24425	24433	24434	24434	I	0	“ Those are all my favorite things ! ”
24488	24501	24470	24471	Mrs. Gray	159	“ Orange juice ? Soda ? Seven different flavors of sparkling water ? ”
24502	24506	24507	24507	she	159	“ Surprise me , ”
24525	24531	24532	24532	I	0	“ Want to play … ? ”
24549	24552	24553	24553	I	0	“ Scrabble ? ”
24557	24571	24553	24553	I	0	“ It ’s not a screen . And you wo n’t be jostled . ”
24572	24584	24585	24585	she	159	“ But I will be soundly beaten by your big brain , ”
24589	24600	24585	24585	she	159	“ We ’d better keep the betting to a minimum . ”
24612	24618	24601	24601	I	0	“ We ’ll wager these . ”
24619	24623	24624	24624	Becca	121	“ That works , ”
24715	24718	24748	24748	Nate	121	“ burp . ”
24735	24743	24744	24744	I	0	“ There should also be style points , ”
24753	24757	24758	24758	Nate	121	“ For what ? ”
24761	24795	24796	24796	Nate	121	“ Anything cheeky . Bodily functions . Expletives . Double points for anything R - rated . Think of the marketing potential ! Teenaged boys would play Scrabble instead of Call of Duty . ”
24804	24818	24796	24796	Nate	121	“ I was the teenaged Scrabble player who was always trying for palindromes . ”
24819	24829	24831	24831	I	0	“ We ca n’t all have a dirty mind . ”
24988	24993	25000	25000	Bingley	139	“ Nathan , sir ? ”
25021	25035	25036	25036	He	139	“ Ramesh would like to know if you ’re in for the night . ”
25041	25049	25038	25038	his	139	“ Absolutely . Engage all security systems . ”
25050	25054	25055	25055	Bingley	139	“ Systems engaged , ”
25069	25095	25066	25066	I	0	“ So , game five tomorrow ? I ’m dying . We have to advance so I can see another game before it ’s over . ”
25096	25101	25102	25102	he	139	“ We ’ll advance , ”
25109	25133	25102	25102	he	139	“ You ’re trying to distract me , are n’t you ? So I do n’t hit that triple word score with quixotic . ”
25155	25160	25161	25161	I	0	“ Listen , bitch , ”
25171	25181	25182	25182	He	139	“ Do your worst . I can take it . ”

25298	25316	25291	25291	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m tired already . All I did this afternoon was sleep . ”
25317	25320	25321	25321	he	139	“ Good , ”

25376	25408	25373	25373	he	139	“ If you ’re there , the guys will put you to work . They ’re used to asking things of you , and you ’re too efficient to say no . “
25416	25456	25373	25373	he	139	“ But I ’m not sure how to pass the time . The no - reading thing is kind of tricky . And no screens ? I feel cut off from everyone , and I ’ve been really bored . ”
25457	25460	25461	25461	Nate	121	“ Hmm . ”
25464	25471	25461	25461	Nate	121	“ You can chat with Bingley . ”

25511	25522	25508	25508	Nate	121	“ Rightio ! Why did the scarecrow get a promotion ? ”
25526	25534	25523	25523	Bingley	139	“ He was outstanding in his field . ”
25562	25566	25567	25567	Nate	121	“ Another one , ”
25570	25582	25567	25567	Nate	121	“ If life gives you melons , you ’re probably dyslexic ! ”
25583	25593	25594	25594	Nate	121	“ Jesus . The humor module needs some work , ”
25597	25604	25594	25594	Nate	121	“ I ’ll tell my programmers . ”
25605	25612	25613	25613	I	0	“ There ’s a humor module ? ”
25623	25641	25642	25642	Nate	121	“ If only people could be taught to be funnier . Now there ’s a real innovation . ”
25651	25657	25658	25658	Bingley	139	“ I hate Russian dolls , ”

25794	25810	25768	25768	he	121	“ Sorry , sir . Sleep with the angels . All security systems are engaged . ”
25957	25974	25940	25940	she	159	“ Rebecca ! Did you sleep well ? How do you like your eggs ? Coffee ? ”
25997	26002	26003	26003	I	0	“ I slept fine , ”
26012	26023	26003	26003	I	0	“ You really do n’t have to cook for me . ”

26516	26540	26485	26485	his	139	“ That ’s because I am Nate . Nate ’s mind . The deep learning he ’s programmed is a very powerful thing . ”
26603	26615	26594	26594	I	0	“ Nate said I should ask you for anything I needed . ”
26616	26619	26578	26578	I	0	“ Absolutely . ”

27058	27076	27020	27020	Bingley	139	“ It ’s tied , Bingley . That means we both still have a fifty percent chance . ”
27077	27099	27100	27100	I	0	“ Not true . The model incorporates player stats in real time . And the Bruisers are dominating the puck control . ”

27196	27202	27203	27203	I	0	“ Do n’t celebrate yet ! ”

28092	28097	28089	28089	he	121	“ One more time ? ”
28104	28138	28100	28100	her	982	“ The caller . On your line one . Someone from an NHL hockey team ? It does n’t sound like a call you ’d want to take , but the man insisted … ”
28139	28144	28145	28145	He	121	“ Oh , shit . ”
28150	28170	28145	28145	He	121	“ I did ask him to call today . Push back the next meeting for ten minutes , okay ? ”
28381	28386	28387	28387	she	982	“ A hockey team ? ”
28430	28442	28419	28419	He	121	“ What do you think , Bec . You like hockey ? ”
28443	28463	28464	28464	She	982	“ I do , as a matter of fact . It ’s a fast moving game . No bullshit . ”
28467	28487	28464	28464	She	982	“ You used to have season tickets to the Rangers , right ? I guess you let those go ? ”
28524	28541	28514	28514	he	121	“ The team I talked to today needs a little work . But I might invest . ”
28542	28545	28546	28546	Her	982	“ Really . ”
28551	28584	28546	28546	Her	982	“ That sounds like fun . If you buy a hockey team , I get to plan the celebration . With all those hunky hockey players . And puck - shaped food . ”
28605	28615	28585	28585	He	121	“ Puck - shaped food ? Like … Oreos ? ”
28616	28627	28661	28666	a young man in a courier	999	“ Pfft . Medallions of pork . Mini beef Wellingtons . ”
28628	28639	28640	28640	They	996	“ Sushi rolls ? Fuck . Now I ’m hungry . ”
28688	28693	28694	28694	he	999	“ There she is ! ”
28698	28701	28694	28694	he	999	“ Ready ? ”
28738	28759	28760	28760	Lauren	137	“ The hotel has two towers . They can accommodate all of us , but not on the same side . ”
28881	28893	28894	28894	I	0	“ It should n’t be like this on a Sunday morning , ”
28908	28929	28897	28897	Lauren	137	“ Ramesh ca n’t get there any faster even if you tap your foot like an asshole the whole time . ”
28930	28938	28897	28897	Lauren	137	“ Thank you , oh wise one . ”
28948	28972	28945	28945	Ramesh	157	“ Listen up , would you ? Or do n’t , I do n’t care . But no bitching about the accommodations later . ”
28987	29000	28978	28978	she	137	“ Just put us in suites . I do n’t care where . ”
29001	29007	29014	29014	her	137	“ You say that now … ”
29020	29048	29014	29014	her	137	“ Okay . I also added your tuxedo to your packing list . Can you think of anything else before I send this off to Mrs. Gray ? ”
29049	29074	28978	28978	she	137	“ Put a pair of swim trunks in there . Do n’t forget your suit . We ’re going to be on the beach . ”
29075	29102	29014	29014	her	137	“ You know , I do n’t actually want to go to Florida . How about you go without me and tell me how it was ? ”
29103	29114	29115	29115	She	137	“ Pack a suit , Lauren . You ’re going . ”
29152	29178	29149	29150	her ex	1005	“ Not many owners would make their players do a black - tie benefit forty - eight hours before the next round of the playoffs . ”
29179	29196	29197	29197	I	0	“ It ’s pretty unusual for our players to make the second round of the playoffs , ”
29201	29225	29197	29197	I	0	“ They have to shake some hands for a couple of hours . They ’ll survive . It ’s for a good cause . ”
29226	29234	29149	29150	her ex	1005	“ Why are we doing this again ? ”
29235	29288	29289	29289	Lauren	137	“ Alex and I had a playoffs bet . My team made the playoffs , and hers did n’t , so she has to donate $ 1 million to charity . The black - tie event is to try to help her match it with other rich people ’s money in Florida . ”
29295	29314	29289	29289	Lauren	137	“ But what were you going to do if you both made the playoffs ? Or neither team ? ”
29315	29339	29149	29150	her ex	1005	“ We ’d probably split it . Or get drunk on really expensive champagne and wonder why we ’d invested in sports teams . ”
29340	29346	29347	29347	Lauren	137	“ Because you love hockey ? ”
29350	29356	29347	29347	Lauren	137	“ Because hockey is everything . ”
29415	29426	29516	29516	She	137	“ I ’m dropping you off at home , right ? ”
29427	29472	29488	29488	Lauren	137	“ Yes , please . But I ’ll rally after a couple hours . Do you want me to meet you at the office ? I will , so long as you realize it ’s Sunday . So I ’ll probably whine about it . ”
29473	29487	29488	29488	Lauren	137	“ Save yourself the trouble . I ’m not going into the office . ”
29495	29515	29516	29516	She	137	“ Then why are we sharing a cab into Manhattan ? Are you lost ? Brooklyn is over there . ”
29525	29543	29516	29516	She	137	“ I ’m headed downtown . Near City Hall . Rebecca has that appointment with the specialist . ”
29576	29593	29571	29571	her	137	“ You have 2000 employees . Do you go to all of their doctors ’ appointments ? ”
29594	29608	29571	29571	her	137	“ Obviously not . That would be both time - consuming and awkward . ”
29609	29619	29571	29571	her	137	“ Then why are you going to Rebecca ’s ? ”
29633	29679	29571	29571	her	137	“ Because I found her this doctor and I want to hear what he says . And because we ’ve known each other a long time . If you were sick and scared , I ’d show up at yours if you wanted me to . ”
29686	29697	29571	29571	her	137	“ I hope I never need that favor from you . ”
29698	29705	29706	29706	I	0	“ As do I , buddy . ”
29774	29780	29767	29768	other patients	1013	“ You know , Nate … ”
29781	29784	29792	29792	she	137	“ Hmm ? ”
29797	29819	29792	29792	she	137	“ That was a good speech you gave the other day to the players . If not now , then when . ”
29820	29826	29827	29827	I	0	“ Not the most original , ”
29831	29838	29827	29827	I	0	“ It was heartfelt , though . ”
29849	29860	29839	29839	She	137	“ I especially liked the part about Why not me . ”
29861	29866	29867	29867	I	0	“ Well , really , ”
29870	29884	29867	29867	I	0	“ Why not us ? This team can take it all the way . ”
29885	29893	29839	29839	She	137	“ Sure . But what about you ? ”
29894	29899	29839	29839	She	137	“ What about me ? ”
29900	29908	29909	29909	She	137	“ If not now , then when ? ”
29914	29920	29909	29909	She	137	“ And why not you ? ”
29921	29943	29944	29944	She	137	“ I do n’t know what we ’re taking about now . And I was paying attention like a good boy . ”
29965	29995	29946	29946	her	137	“ I think you know what I mean . And if you do n’t , then I hope you ’ll figure it out soon . Give Rebecca my love . ”
30207	30211	30212	30212	I	0	“ Tell me , ”
30240	30246	30247	30247	she	137	“ He s - said … ”
30250	30259	30247	30247	she	137	“ H - he knows what ’s wrong . ”
30260	30263	30266	30266	myself	0	“ And ? ”
30268	30277	30266	30266	myself	0	“ And it ’s going to be okay . ”
30302	30307	30308	30308	I	0	“ That ’s good , ”
30312	30320	30308	30308	I	0	“ Then why are you so upset ? ”
30321	30326	30327	30327	She	137	“ B - because … ”
30340	30376	30327	30327	She	137	“ Nobody said that before ! They said , ‘ We do n’t know why your injury does n’t behave like a concussion . Just go home and wait . ’ But Doctor Armitage said … ”
30377	30384	30397	30397	Rebecca	121	“ It ’s a vestibular problem ! ”
30428	30460	30424	30424	he	1028	“ The concussion is n’t the issue anymore . When Rebecca hit the ice , she disturbed some of the nerves in her ear . Normal sensory processing is temporarily scrambled . ”
30461	30464	30424	30424	he	1028	“ Oh . ”
30473	30485	30465	30465	I	0	“ It ’s rarer than a concussion . But not worse . ”
30495	30516	30517	30517	He	1028	“ That ’s right . She ’s going to have to put a lot of effort into her therapy here — ”
30535	30582	30517	30517	He	1028	“ She needs to train her body and brain to communicate efficiently again . My therapists will help her work on balance and coordination . In a few weeks she ’ll see some improvement , and in a few months she will make a full recovery . ”
30598	30607	30592	30592	she	1030	“ I ca n’t wait to get started . ”
30608	30614	30615	30615	He	1028	“ The day after tomorrow . ”
30623	30710	30615	30615	He	1028	“ We ’ll set you up with a trainer . Sessions are ninety minutes . In the meantime , you ’re going to take good care of yourself . You can be as active as you wish , but you need a good eight or ten hours of sleep . And limited screen time . No blue light after sundown . Set your phone to the warm light setting , and do n’t look at it much until you ’re seeing some improvement in your symptoms . ”
30717	30753	30711	30712	The doctor	638	“ If you two have a TV in your bedroom , it needs to stay off for a few weeks . Most couples can usually find better things to do with the time , anyway . ”
30775	30778	30755	30756	the doctor	638	“ Um … ”
30820	30830	30800	30800	I	0	“ … Three sessions a week for ninety minutes . ”
30838	30860	30831	30832	The doctor	638	“ We ’ll take baseline measurements first , and then we ’ll get right to work . Pleasure meeting you both . ”
30876	30879	30872	30872	he	638	“ Wow . ”
30888	30899	30880	30880	Rebecca	121	“ I am so relieved . You have no idea . ”
30900	30914	30921	30921	I	0	“ It ’s great news , Bec . You ready to head home ? ”
30983	30991	30992	30992	she	638	“ Are you going into the office ? ”
31023	31052	31053	31053	Rebecca	121	“ No . It ’s Sunday . I ’ll take the day off for a change . Besides , it ’s time for lunch . I ’m starving . ”
31056	31066	31067	31067	She	638	“ Let ’s find you some lunch . Sushi ? ”
31112	31119	31120	31120	I	0	“ Let ’s walk a ways , ”
31123	31146	31120	31120	I	0	“ Find a food truck , maybe ? It ’s a nice day and I ’ve been on a plane all morning . ”
31154	31160	31147	31147	I	0	“ Where ’s your stuff ? ”
31161	31172	31173	31173	I	0	“ In the car with Ramesh . Hey — look . ”
31182	31190	31173	31173	I	0	“ How do you feel about falafel ? ”
31191	31199	31200	31200	she	638	“ Let ’s see how it looks , ”
31203	31219	31200	31200	she	638	“ A good falafel is heaven . An indifferent falafel is a waste of carbs . ”
31350	31359	31338	31338	I	0	“ Want to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
31370	31373	31374	31374	She	638	“ Sure ! ”
31385	31402	31378	31378	her	638	“ Walking and eating , though . I have enough trouble with coordination as it is . ”
31419	31432	31433	31433	she	638	“ Do n’t you have to tell Ramesh where you ’ve gone ? ”
31479	31490	31465	31465	She	638	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to use screens ? ”
31491	31494	31495	31495	she	638	“ Much , ”
31499	31536	31495	31495	she	638	“ But now I ’m not following the concussion protocol , so it ’s a little different . Reading books is okay again . Blue light after dark is the only thing I ca n’t have . ”
31579	31587	31588	31588	she	638	“ Hey — thanks for the audiobooks , ”
31592	31599	31588	31588	she	638	“ That was a lovely idea . ”
31600	31605	31553	31553	her	638	“ You ’re welcome . ”
31606	31650	31588	31588	she	638	“ I also listened to the game . I had to turn my back to your TV so I would n’t be tempted to watch . When Trevi got that fourth goal I shrieked so loudly that Bingley asked if I was okay . ”
31651	31654	31588	31588	she	638	“ Yeah ? ”
31670	31685	31663	31663	Rebecca	121	“ That ’s funny . Did you notice Bingley taking any other wrong cues ? ”
31700	31715	31695	31695	I	0	“ He was a perfect gentleman . I sneezed and he said bless you . ”
31716	31727	31663	31663	Rebecca	121	“ Yeah ? That ’s classy . Go , Bingley . ”
31784	31804	31773	31773	Rebecca	121	“ Congratulations , Nate . Seriously . That game was amazing . I ’m so happy you ’re advancing . ”
31805	31812	31813	31813	I	0	“ I did n’t win it , ”
31823	31836	31813	31813	I	0	“ But it sure was fun to watch . Ready to walk ? ”
31837	31841	31842	31842	I	0	“ Sure thing . ”
31933	31945	31946	31946	Rebecca	121	“ I ’m doing three sessions a week with the trainers , ”
31950	32007	31946	31946	Rebecca	121	“ Doctor Armitage said that the first few will really wipe me out , but that I should n’t get discouraged . He ’s never had a vestibular patient who could n’t improve a lot with therapy — unless something else is also wrong . But he does n’t think that ’s the case with me . ”
32008	32018	31946	31946	Rebecca	121	“ Okay . I like the sound of that . ”
32019	32042	31946	31946	Rebecca	121	“ Me too ! I could be back to work soon . He said we ’d talk about it in two weeks . ”
32058	32071	32072	32072	Becca	121	“ I was thinking I could go part - time at first , ”
32075	32082	32083	32083	She	1070	“ See what the doctor says . ”
32091	32126	32083	32083	She	1070	“ Do n’t kill my buzz , Nate . Oh — and speaking of buzzes — the no - alcohol rule is still in force . Apparently vestibular systems can be confused by alcohol . ”
32127	32139	32140	32140	She	1070	“ I could have told you that . Tequila , especially . ”
32156	32175	32151	32151	I	0	“ Tell me about this party Mrs. Gray is packing for . Bal Harbour ? It sounds glam . ”
32176	32209	32227	32227	her	1070	“ Alex planned it . If glam is the same thing as Alex making me wear a tux , then I guess it is . Fucking bow ties . I hate them . ”
32210	32222	32223	32223	She	1070	“ That ’s only because you still ca n’t tie one . ”
32248	32264	32242	32242	I	0	“ I can too tie a bow tie . I just do n’t enjoy it . ”
32265	32284	32285	32285	She	1070	“ Here ’s a deal for you — I’ll tie the bow tie for you . In Florida . ”
32288	32308	32285	32285	She	1070	“ On a beach . I ca n’t believe I ’m missing this party . The universe hates me . ”
32309	32330	32242	32242	I	0	“ It ’s too bad . I could use the company . You have to go to therapy , though . ”
32331	32372	32373	32373	Her	1070	“ Nope . I took someone ’s cancellation for Tuesday , but then they ca n’t get me in until Thursday . What do you mean you could use the company ? I could be an extra set of hands ! ”
32381	32397	32373	32373	Her	1070	“ It ’s been weeks since I saw everyone . I feel like a hermit . ”
32398	32404	32407	32407	myself	0	“ Then you should come , ”
32410	32422	32407	32407	myself	0	“ Lauren told me to bring a date to this benefit . ”
32423	32429	32430	32430	Becca	121	“ A date ? Really ? ”
32450	32470	32430	32430	Becca	121	“ What for ? I do n’t know if I ’d be any good at asking people for donations . ”
32476	32515	32430	32430	Becca	121	“ That ’s not the reason at all . I need the cocktail hour to be a social event . Your only job would be to shut down any business chatter on an M&A deal I ’m considering . ”
32525	32530	32531	32531	She	1070	“ Oh , okay . ”
32537	32554	32531	32531	She	1070	“ I really want to go . But I already owe you in so many ways . ”
32555	32558	32559	32559	I	0	“ Bullshit , ”
32563	32579	32559	32559	I	0	“ You do n’t owe me a thing , okay ? Do n’t say that . ”
32604	32638	32590	32590	I	0	“ Come to Florida . Sit on the beach for a day with Georgia . Visit the land of the living . Then get yourself back here in time for your therapy appointments . ”
32639	32642	32643	32643	She	1070	“ Yay ! ”
32649	32689	32643	32643	She	1070	“ I need to do a deep dive into my closet . This will be fun . How dressy is this party ? I ’m trying to picture tuxes on a beach . Sounds a little like a wedding . ”
32690	32697	32698	32698	Becca	121	“ Dumbest thing I ever heard . ”
32701	32718	32719	32719	She	1070	“ I ’ll ask Georgia what to wear . I ca n’t wait to see her . ”
32735	32740	32698	32698	Becca	121	“ I got you ! ”
32771	32786	32757	32757	His	1073	“ Come on , Miss Rowley . Keep those eyes closed and start jumping . ”
32938	32943	32944	32944	Ramón	183	“ Come on now , ”
32953	32961	32948	32948	He	183	“ Close those eyes , Miss Rowley . ”
32962	32967	32968	32968	I	0	“ Call me Becca , ”
32973	32996	32968	32968	I	0	“ Jump , Becca . Bounce your butt in the air before I make you stay after school for disobeying the teacher . ”
33087	33094	33095	33095	he	183	“ So this is going well , ”
33102	33117	33099	33099	he	183	“ Ca n’t we go back to the walking ? Or the balance beam ? ”
33183	33192	33193	33193	he	183	“ Nope ! Let ’s finish up here , ”
33201	33224	33193	33193	he	183	“ But , hey , let ’s have you bounce for a moment with your eyes open . Just try that much . ”
33303	33308	33309	33309	Ramón	183	“ That ’s it , ”
33312	33322	33309	33309	Ramón	183	“ Pick a gaze point . You feel solid ? ”
33323	33327	33356	33356	Ramón	183	“ Solid enough . ”
33363	33376	33356	33356	Ramón	183	“ Okay , Becca . Close your eyes and bounce five times . ”
33401	33412	33393	33393	Ramón	183	“ You ’ve got this . Just a couple more . ”
33468	33477	33460	33460	I	0	“ The trampoline is trying to kill me . ”
33478	33501	33438	33438	He	183	“ No , it is n’t . Trampolines are fun . We ’ll have you bouncing like a pro in no time . ”
33528	33534	33535	33535	I	0	“ Is my time up ? ”
33539	33566	33535	33535	I	0	“ We have five more minutes . Come over here . This part is easy — all you have to do is sit in a chair . ”
33567	33591	33592	33592	Ramón	183	“ That ’s something I ’ve always been good at . Especially if there ’s wine and a Channing Tatum movie on TV . ”
33595	33620	33621	33621	He	183	“ Wine is a bad idea , Miss Rebecca . Give your body a couple more weeks to find its balance before you indulge . ”
33635	33658	33621	33621	He	183	“ You ’d better not tell me that Channing Tatum is bad for my recovery . Or I ’m out of here . ”
33659	33689	33621	33621	He	183	“ That male stripper movie , right ? My girlfriend loves it . If Channing Tatum wanted to bounce on the trampoline with you , would you say yes ? ”
33690	33696	33748	33748	Ramón	183	“ You know I would . ”
33697	33717	33720	33720	he	183	“ Then I ’ll give that man a call to see if he ’s available for your next session . ”
33765	33774	33748	33748	Ramón	183	“ Oh my God . I hate you , ”
33803	33810	33811	33811	He	183	“ No , you do n’t . ”
33857	33863	33847	33847	he	183	“ How do you feel ? ”
33864	33869	33870	33870	He	183	“ Dizzy ! Duh . ”
33878	33888	33870	33870	He	183	“ Tell me when you ’re no longer dizzy . ”
33939	33948	33920	33920	I	0	“ Now . The room has stopped moving . ”
33949	33955	33962	33962	his	183	“ Fifty - five seconds , ”
33965	33992	33956	33956	Ramón	183	“ A normal vestibular system will have you recovered after ten seconds . So that ’s our goal . Ten seconds . We ’ll get there . ”
34012	34045	34046	34046	He	1083	“ Is that it for now , tough guy ? Because I have a party to attend , where I get to wear a dress for the first time in a month . ”
34051	34084	34046	34046	He	1083	“ Go get ‘ em , Rebecca . Have a great time . But do n’t drink , unless you want to feel worse than the spinning chair just made you feel . ”
34085	34089	34090	34090	I	0	“ Got it ! ”
34116	34123	34124	34124	Ramón	183	“ See you on the flipside . ”
34288	34303	34274	34274	I	0	“ Where can I drop my stuff so we can play on the beach ? ”
34304	34317	34274	34274	I	0	“ I have your room key . You can go right up . ”
34318	34326	34274	34274	I	0	“ I ’m not bunking with you ? ”
34327	34347	34348	34348	Her	128	“ Not this time . It ’s not a game night , so I get to bunk with Leo . ”
34387	34401	34384	34384	I	0	“ Nate added you to the hotel list . You get room 404 . ”
34402	34416	34348	34349	Her fiancé	1092	“ Huh . I did n’t ask Nate to get me a room . ”
34417	34424	34384	34384	I	0	“ He got you one anyway . ”
34431	34461	34384	34384	I	0	“ I did n’t let him buy my plane ticket , though . Since I ’m not really here in an official capacity , that would just be weird . ”
34508	34520	34500	34500	I	0	“ Stop worrying . You brought a bathing suit , right ? ”
34521	34550	34488	34488	He	121	“ Yes ma’am . And some heavy - duty sunblock . Let ’s go sit on a towel and gossip . I have n’t seen you in ages . ”
34631	34642	34643	34643	Georgia	128	“ What ’s it like staying at Nate ’s house ? ”
34646	34683	34643	34643	Georgia	128	“ Strange . Like playing house in a mansion . He and I went out for sushi the other night . Mrs. Gray does n’t work on Sunday and Nate never goes into his kitchen alone . ”
34684	34693	34709	34709	Georgia	128	“ Does he even know where it is ? ”
34694	34708	34709	34709	Georgia	128	“ Of course , because that ’s where the Diet Coke is kept . ”
34712	34729	34709	34709	Georgia	128	“ That house must just echo . Is it weird spending time like that with him ? ”
34735	34796	34709	34709	Georgia	128	“ Yes and no . Nate and I used to spend a whole lot of time together . On planes . In hotels and conference rooms on the road . All those early trips to Silicon Valley and even Asia , before he had a big entourage . We always stuck together because we ’d be in a strange place . ”
34805	34828	34709	34709	Georgia	128	“ I always forget that you used to spend your whole week with him . That sounds like a real bonding experience . ”
34829	34882	34709	34709	Georgia	128	“ It was . Honestly , the only thing weird about hanging around with him at home is that it ’s not that weird . It ’s like … It ’s made me miss him . Which makes no sense . But those were good days . We made a good team . ”
34883	34886	34887	34887	Georgia	128	“ Mmm . ”
34894	34918	34887	34887	Georgia	128	“ I get it . That was special . Not everybody can say she was Nate Kattenberger ’s sidekick for five straight years . ”
34919	34957	34958	34958	I	0	“ He was n’t the famous CEO of KTech back then . He was just a guy who could n’t unjam the printer without my help . But he told really good jokes . He was fun . ”
34987	34994	34983	34983	him	1100	“ You know what ’s crazy ? ”
35001	35045	34999	34999	Georgia	128	“ When things go wrong , Nate never yells . He ’s hard to impress , but you ca n’t freak him out , either . I do n’t think I really appreciated that until I went to work for the hockey team . ”
35046	35054	35055	35055	Georgia	128	“ Hugh is a little more volatile , ”
35066	35141	35055	35055	Georgia	128	“ He ’s fine . But he panics sometimes , like a normal person . He yells now and then . But Nate is like a stone in the river . Everything rushes past , but he is n’t swayed . I think that ’s why I ’ve felt calmer since I went to stay with him . He keeps telling me everything is going to be okay , and I believe him because … ”
35149	35162	35142	35142	I	0	“ Because he ’s smarter than anyone else we ’ll ever meet ? ”
35163	35168	35218	35218	Georgia	128	“ Yeah . Sure . ”
35204	35217	35218	35218	Georgia	128	“ It ’s almost time to get dolled up for this party , ”
35222	35251	35218	35218	Georgia	128	“ Is it okay with you if we get ready in Lauren ’s suite ? She asked us to come up . There ’s snacks , I think . ”
35252	35259	35269	35269	her	1107	“ Sure ? Snacks are nice . ”
35285	35297	35298	35298	Georgia	128	“ Since when does Lauren want to pal around with us ? ”
35301	35329	35298	35298	Georgia	128	“ I ’m not sure Lauren is the superbitch we think she is . Did you know that she and Mike Beacon used to be a couple ? ”
35330	35333	35269	35269	her	1107	“ No ! ”
35334	35338	35269	35269	her	1107	“ True story . ”
35339	35349	35269	35269	her	1107	“ Mike Beacon ? I ca n’t picture that . ”
35356	35366	35269	35269	her	1107	“ Lauren always says how much she hates hockey . ”
35367	35370	35371	35371	Georgia	128	“ Yeah . ”
35375	35403	35371	35371	Georgia	128	“ I ’m pretty sure she only started hating hockey after Mike Beacon dumped her over the phone to move back in with his ex - wife . ”
35404	35407	35408	35408	We	1109	“ Whoa ! ”
35431	35440	35425	35426	Queen Lauren	137	“ Wait — when did they break up ? ”
35441	35455	35488	35488	Nate	121	“ Two years ago , right around the time Nate bought the Bruisers . ”
35456	35467	35425	35426	Queen Lauren	137	“ Right at the moment when Lauren got my job . ”
35527	35536	35537	35537	Georgia	128	“ I was thinking about this , too , ”
35540	35580	35537	35537	Georgia	128	“ Is it possible that Nate factored her breakup in to swapping your jobs ? Maybe he knew Lauren was a good employee , but that she ’d quit if he did n’t get her out of that office . ”
35581	35586	35587	35587	I	0	“ That’s … interesting , ”
35590	35596	35587	35587	I	0	“ But kind of farfetched . ”
35597	35600	35601	35601	Georgia	128	“ Maybe , ”
35608	35623	35604	35604	her	128	“ I know it ’s always bothered you that Nate sent you to Brooklyn . ”
35624	35634	35604	35604	her	128	“ Yeah . I probably wo n’t ever understand . ”
35646	35650	35604	35604	her	128	“ lateral move , ”
35835	35839	35828	35828	her	137	“ Hi there . ”
35840	35874	35875	35875	I	0	“ I see that look of excitement on your face . But , sadly , I ’m not back in action yet . My fancy new doctor has outlined several weeks of therapy . ”
35896	35937	35875	35875	I	0	“ I whined so loudly that Nate agreed to a temporary furlough . I ’ve been let out for good behavior for this party so long as I ’m back at the therapist ’s office in forty - eight hours . ”
35938	35941	35942	35942	Lauren	137	“ Oh . ”
35947	35970	35942	35942	Lauren	137	“ Ah , well . I guess I have to go to this fucking party after all . Somebody open the wine . ”
35987	35993	35994	35994	Georgia	128	“ How are you feeling ? ”
36005	36047	35994	35994	Georgia	128	“ Right now ? I feel great . I ’m sitting here eating overpriced hotel food , and I just painted your toes a kickass shade of pink . But sometimes I get all squinty and the room tends to spin . ”
36048	36051	36052	36054	my best friend	345	“ Bummer , ”
36061	36094	36052	36054	my best friend	345	“ It really is . But I like my new doctor , and I feel really hopeful that they know what to do . I ’m so tired of being a drag . ”
36095	36102	36103	36103	Georgia	128	“ You ’re never a drag , ”
36107	36114	36103	36103	Georgia	128	“ If only that were true . ”
36115	36124	36125	36125	she	128	“ Is it weird being away from work ? ”
36128	36165	36125	36125	she	128	“ So weird . I feel like maybe they ’ll just forget about me and hire someone else . Did n’t we used to have someone at that desk ? Better put someone in that spot . ”
36166	36175	36176	36176	Ari	185	“ What ’s it like staying with Nate ? ”
36180	36194	36176	36176	Ari	185	“ He ’s probably never home , I guess . Except to sleep . ”
36195	36215	36216	36216	Georgia	128	“ Maybe ? But I ’m in his private lair . He ca n’t walk around naked or whatever . ”
36219	36233	36216	36216	Georgia	128	“ If you see him naked , I want details . That body . ”
36240	36257	36216	36216	Georgia	128	“ Stop it . I try not to sit around thinking about Nate ’s naked body . ”
36302	36312	36313	36313	Georgia	128	“ Why not ? Everyone has a naked body , ”
36317	36328	36313	36313	Georgia	128	“ Even the guy wearing the eight hundred dollar sneakers . ”
36349	36418	36339	36339	GQ	186	“ But we do n’t have to picture it . That ’s dangerous . If I indulge in that kind of curiosity , some day we ’ll be sitting in a meeting with the marketing department , and I ’ll be picturing Naked Nate . And someone will turn to me and ask a question about ticket sales , and I ’ll probably answer , ‘ biceps . ’ ”
36419	36426	36427	36427	Georgia	128	“ He has really nice biceps , ”
36430	36433	36427	36427	Georgia	128	“ Stop , ”
36470	36483	36484	36484	Lauren	137	“ Becca — it ’s your turn to show us your dress , ”
36517	36525	36526	36526	I	0	“ It ’s a vintage 1950s strapless . ”
36551	36554	36555	36555	Georgia	128	“ Wow ! ”
36558	36572	36555	36555	Georgia	128	“ I ’m glad you decided it was time to wear that one . ”
36573	36579	36580	36580	I	0	“ I know , right ? ”
36587	36623	36580	36580	I	0	“ I hope it ’s dressy enough . Nate asked me to have drinks with him before this shindig starts . He ’s meeting his old friend before the party starts , and he says … ”
36641	36664	36665	36665	Lauren	137	“ Stick close because I do n’t want to talk business . Alex wants to pick my pocket on the router division . ”
36668	36683	36665	36665	Lauren	137	“ Oh , Nate . Way to handle it like a grown - up . ”
36684	36694	36695	36695	I	0	“ I met Alex once a long time ago , ”
36708	36735	36702	36702	Lauren	137	“ Do you think Nate has a thing for her ? Is there another angle here ? Am I supposed to make her jealous or something ? ”
36736	36739	36740	36740	Lauren	137	“ No ! ”
36744	36781	36740	36740	Lauren	137	“ There ’s nothing between those two . Nate does n’t want to get an offer from Alex on the router division because he thinks he can get a better deal if someone else offers first . ”
36782	36787	36702	36702	Lauren	137	“ Oh , okay … ”
36790	36826	36827	36828	My friend	1099	“ Tonight just got so much less interesting than I thought it was . Too bad I ’m not supposed to drink . Georgia — come here , honey . Let me fix your mascara . ”
36832	36839	36827	36828	My friend	1099	“ Did I goof it up ? ”
36840	36860	36827	36828	My friend	1099	“ Not yet , baby doll . But you ’re probably going to . Let Auntie Becca do that . ”
36861	36869	36870	36870	Georgia	128	“ You have no confidence in me ! ”
36882	36899	36875	36875	she	128	“ I have every confidence in you ! Except when it comes to fashion and makeup . ”
37116	37120	37121	37121	Lauren	137	“ You know … ”
37129	37190	37121	37121	Lauren	137	“ Maybe you ’re on to something . Occasionally I get a vibe off of Alex , like she might have a thing for Nate . But I could be wrong . And lord knows Nate might not even notice . That man is pretty sharp about everyone ’s motivations , and a total dunce when it comes to himself . ”
37210	37220	37193	37193	her	137	“ Did you ever meet Juliet , his ex ? ”
37221	37226	37227	37227	Lauren	137	“ No ! You ? ”
37256	37309	37246	37246	Nate	121	“ Of course I did . She was around a lot in the early days . Nate did n’t travel as much the first year I worked with him , and their offices were walking distance apart . She would bring by dinner for him sometimes . They were a cute couple . ”
37315	37327	37328	37328	Lauren	137	“ It ’s hard to picture Nate as half a couple , ”
37331	37337	37338	37338	I	0	“ He was , though , ”
37349	37383	37341	37341	I	0	“ He was devoted — the kind of fiancé who wants to help plan the wedding . They were going with a Doctor Who theme , with TARDIS on top of the cake … ”
37466	37470	37471	37471	Georgia	128	“ Hold this ? ”
37487	37500	37501	37501	she	128	“ God , I hate heels . How do you do it ? ”
37505	37519	37501	37501	she	128	“ I ’m a short girl . I ’ve been practicing since puberty . ”
37542	37545	37537	37537	Nate	121	“ Lauren ? ”
37546	37550	37551	37551	she	128	“ Hang on ! ”
37560	37566	37551	37551	she	128	“ We need a minute ! ”
37570	37576	37567	37567	I	0	“ We ’re not decent ! ”
37605	37609	37610	37610	Lauren	137	“ Come in , ”
37652	37675	37649	37649	he	121	“ I ’ve been on the phone with Silicon Valley all day . Did n’t know there was a party next door . ”
37676	37683	37684	37684	I	0	“ You poor , poor thing , ”
37699	37718	37687	37687	I	0	“ Did you really just knock on Lauren ’s door because you ca n’t tie a bow tie ? ”
37728	37733	37725	37725	he	121	“ I hate tuxes . ”
37744	37754	37734	37734	His	121	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to drink ? ”
37777	37792	37769	37769	Georgia	128	“ She ’s holding that for me so I could try on these shoes . ”
37793	37801	37802	37802	I	0	“ That ’s the truth , officer , ”
37805	37816	37802	37802	I	0	“ Now come closer so I can do this right . ”
37891	37899	37900	37900	I	0	“ So , about this thing tonight , ”
37927	37943	37917	37917	Nate	121	“ Am I your buffer for the whole evening ? Or just the beginning part ? ”
37944	37949	37950	37950	he	121	“ Just for drinks , ”
37957	37978	37950	37950	he	121	“ Alex ca n’t buttonhole me all evening . She ’ll have to work the room for her charitable cause . ”
37979	37982	37983	37983	I	0	“ Awesome ! ”
38011	38028	38029	38029	Nate	121	“ I want to dance with basketball players . They ’re probably quick on their feet . ”
38032	38042	38029	38029	Nate	121	“ It ’s almost time to meet Alex downstairs . ”
38043	38056	38057	38057	I	0	“ I know , slave driver . Let me grab my clutch . ”
38069	38079	38057	38057	I	0	“ Can I leave my things here for now ? ”
38089	38093	38094	38094	Lauren	137	“ Of course , ”
38098	38102	38094	38094	Lauren	137	“ Have fun . ”
38158	38164	38165	38165	I	0	“ Cheer up , boss , ”
38174	38195	38168	38168	Nate	121	“ We ’re at a beach , and my handbag sparkles . It ’s going to be a good night . ”
38200	38224	38168	38168	Nate	121	“ Fine . I ’ll try to have a good time . I have n’t seen Alex in a couple months , anyway . ”
38225	38229	38196	38196	His	121	“ Why not ? ”
38230	38233	38234	38234	He	121	“ Busy . ”
38237	38254	38234	38234	He	121	“ Her office is twenty blocks from mine . But we have n’t made the time . ”
38446	38450	38451	38451	Nate	121	“ Everything okay ? ”
38467	38478	38455	38455	I	0	“ Totally fine . This is just a temporary setback . ”

41493	41514	41487	41487	Alex	152	“ Seriously ? I hope you were n’t actually trying to keep it a secret . Your poker face sucks . ”

41887	41893	41894	41894	I	0	“ That ’s not true , ”
41897	41913	41894	41894	I	0	“ It ’s just that the ones I like do n’t seem to notice me . ”

42012	42044	42007	42007	She	152	“ You ’d better hustle some dollars , too , Kattenberger . Just because I lost our bet does n’t mean you get to loaf around drinking Scotch on my dime . ”

42199	42240	42183	42183	she	137	“ Just the usual . If somebody is monopolizing me , think up a reason to drag me away . I think I just challenged Alex to a duel — who can raise the most cash in the next hour . ”
42241	42266	42267	42267	I	0	“ Of course you did . Hey — that guy over there with the silver tie ? He ’s a Florida senator , right ? ”

42420	42458	42416	42416	Lauren	137	“ Why do you think it ’s okay to stage an intervention in my life , yet I have to pretend not to notice all the things wrong in yours ? Ignoring all your bullshit gets old . ”

43078	43096	43075	43075	Alex	152	“ Why do you suppose Nate moved you to Brooklyn from his Manhattan office two years ago ? ”
43114	43120	43109	43109	Alex	152	“ I have no idea , ”

43277	43311	43264	43264	I	0	“ If you ’re trying to point out that Nate upgraded to a smarter , more fashionable , more ambitious assistant than I ’ll ever be , believe me , I already know . ”
43324	43327	43329	43329	she	152	“ Chardonnay . ”
43359	43365	43366	43366	she	1197	“ My point , hon , ”
43370	43391	43366	43366	she	1197	“ is only that maybe you should ask Nate . Make him tell you why he moved you to Brooklyn . ”
43392	43395	43366	43366	she	1197	“ Uh … ”
43403	43406	43407	43407	Alex	152	“ Okay ? ”

53709	53727	53688	53688	Missy	127	“ Just a bureaucratic snafu . Talking to the insurance company will probably eat half a day . ”
53754	53759	53760	53760	Missy	127	“ Mail the lease ! ”
53771	53781	53760	53760	Missy	127	“ That ’s one less thing to worry about . ”
54088	54091	54092	54092	Stew	142	“ Nice ! ”
54105	54122	54092	54092	Stew	142	“ That ’s how it ’s done ! I think your boys can make this happen . ”
54277	54285	54286	54286	I	0	“ We ’ll speak soon , okay ? ”
54302	54317	54296	54296	She	1439	“ I ’m going to be mostly offline this week . Doctor ’s orders . ”
54550	54555	54556	54556	Lauren	137	“ Oh my God , ”
54559	54570	54556	54556	Lauren	137	“ This game is taking a year off my life . ”
54732	54735	54736	54736	Stew	142	“ Nate . ”
54746	54756	54738	54738	his	142	“ Are you seriously not paying attention right now ? ”
54757	54761	54762	54762	I	0	“ I am , ”
54765	54778	54779	54779	he	142	“ Only you could think about work at a time like this , ”
54929	54933	54934	54934	Lauren	137	“ Power play ! ”
54945	54953	54954	54954	she	137	“ Nice to see you paying attention , ”
54957	54968	54969	54969	I	0	“ Nice to see you ’re a hockey fan again , ”
55018	55023	55024	55024	she	137	“ This is torture , ”
55403	55406	55399	55399	Stew	142	“ What ? ”
55407	55410	55411	55411	he	142	“ Nothing , ”
55417	55429	55411	55411	he	142	“ Want a beer ? I ’m going to the bar . ”
55430	55435	55436	55436	I	0	“ I ’m good , ”
55439	55449	55436	55436	I	0	“ I ’ll get you a drink , Stew , ”
55458	55467	55450	55450	Lauren	137	“ No ! You do n’t have to . ”
55505	55520	55521	55521	She	137	“ But I want a drink and I do n’t know what they have . ”
55529	55548	55521	55521	She	137	“ I ’ll go . And maybe you can snap Nate out of being such a space cadet . ”
55549	55552	55553	55553	Stew	142	“ Dude , ”
55559	55580	55553	55553	Stew	142	“ What is up with you ? And do n’t tell me you are thinking about systems architecture right now . ”
55581	55592	55593	55593	Stew	142	“ I ’m a little distracted . No big deal . ”
55598	55617	55595	55595	his	142	“ Please tell me you ’ve finally broken your dry spell . I was starting to get worried . ”
55618	55624	55625	55625	He	142	“ Oh , fuck off . ”
55628	55636	55625	55625	He	142	“ So who ’s the lucky girl ? ”
55637	55647	55652	55652	his	142	“ I ca n’t talk about this with you . ”
55655	55659	55652	55652	his	142	“ Why not ? ”
55660	55672	55595	55595	his	142	“ Because you know her . I ’m not a gossip . ”
55673	55695	55625	55625	He	142	“ You are totally a gossip . But also weirdly discreet . Now this will drive me insane , you realize . ”
55696	55701	55652	55652	his	142	“ Not my problem . ”
55702	55716	55717	55717	I	0	“ Fucker . I ’m almost tempted to think you finally bagged Rebecca . ”
55736	55741	55742	55742	he	142	“ No fucking way , ”
55765	55773	55745	55745	People	2985	“ Seriously ? When did this happen ? ”
55774	55789	55790	55790	Stew	142	“ Remember ten seconds ago when I told you we were n’t discussing it ? ”
55795	55802	55790	55790	Stew	142	“ Is this an ongoing thing ? ”
55807	55829	55803	55803	I	0	“ I ’d feel a whole lot better right now if you tell me you ’ve been secretly dating all year . ”
55830	55838	55839	55839	I	0	“ Not as much as I would , ”
55845	55864	55842	55842	Stew	142	“ So … this happened once , and now she ’s freezing you out ? Was it recently ? ”
55865	55898	55803	55803	I	0	“ Bal Harbour . Just a few days ago . Then she went back to New York , and I ’m here . I do n’t know what ’s in her head . ”
55899	55912	55803	55803	I	0	“ Did you call her ? Please tell me you called her . ”
55913	55930	55931	55931	Stew	142	“ Of course I did . No pickup , though . I sent a few texts . ”
55936	55943	55931	55931	Stew	142	“ Then you have a problem . ”
55944	55950	55803	55803	I	0	“ Gosh , you think ? ”
55951	55975	55803	55803	I	0	“ No , a big problem . She ’s your employee , and now you ’re pursuing her . You have to stop . ”
55976	55987	55988	55988	Stew	142	“ Obviously she and I need to have a conversation . ”
56008	56017	55988	55988	Stew	142	“ No . I think you fucked up . ”
56018	56025	56026	56026	I	0	“ And you know this how ? ”
56043	56065	56036	56036	I	0	“ You two got it on , and now she ’s not returning your calls ? That ’s some bad juju . ”
56066	56075	56026	56026	I	0	“ Maybe she just needs time to process . ”
56081	56096	56026	56026	I	0	“ How did this go down anyway ? Please tell me she started it . ”
56123	56129	56108	56108	she	137	“ She definitely escalated it . ”
56130	56135	56108	56108	she	137	“ You kissed her . ”
56136	56140	56141	56141	I	0	“ I did , ”
56196	56203	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ You planted one on her , ”
56207	56212	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ Then what happened ? ”
56213	56246	56168	56170	my HR officers	1484	“ She made a noise , so I stopped . Then she yelled at me for a minute , climbed in my lap , and kissed me like the world was ending . ”
56257	56270	56249	56249	Stew	142	“ Wow . You ’ve been waiting years for that to happen . ”
56278	56289	56249	56249	Stew	142	“ So you guys got freaky . And then what ? ”
56290	56299	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ You do n’t get any more details . ”
56300	56309	56249	56249	Stew	142	“ I meant in the morning , dumbass . ”
56312	56359	56249	56249	Stew	142	“ I spent the night . Then I asked her to have breakfast with me , but she said she had plans . I put her in the limo an hour later , kissed her goodbye , said I could n’t wait to see her again . ”
56360	56370	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ And now she ’s not taking your call . ”
56371	56375	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ Pretty much . ”
56376	56380	56381	56381	Stew	142	“ Jesus Christ . ”
56388	56396	56381	56381	Stew	142	“ She was n’t drunk , right ? ”
56397	56422	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ No ! Not at all . She was chatty , asking me questions . She asked me why I transferred her to Brooklyn . ”
56423	56438	56204	56204	Stew	142	“ And you said , ‘ Because I ’m in love with you ’ ? ”
56439	56449	56381	56381	Stew	142	“ No . That would have been an exaggeration . ”
56480	56496	56497	56497	I	0	“ My initial analysis suggests only two reasons why she is n’t returning your call . ”
56507	56524	56497	56497	I	0	“ Number one , she did n’t like it and does n’t want to tell you . ”
56525	56530	56531	56531	I	0	“ She liked it , ”
56566	56571	56572	56572	He	1489	“ Well , congratulations . ”
56583	56609	56572	56572	He	1489	“ But the other option is n’t any better . Which is that she liked it at the time , but now she regrets it . ”
56623	56629	56610	56610	He	1489	“ What ’s to regret ? ”
56630	56647	56572	56572	He	1489	“ Complicating her life , for starters . You ’re the boss . It ’s tricky . ”
56648	56655	56666	56666	He	1489	“ I ’m not her boss . ”
56656	56665	56666	56666	He	1489	“ Nate , you ’re smarter than that . ”
56673	56704	56666	56666	He	1489	“ You hired her . You gave her the exact job she has now . Even if she technically works for Hugh , you ’re still her boss ’s boss . ”
56774	56780	56781	56781	Stew	142	“ I see that face , ”
56784	56823	56781	56781	Stew	142	“ You hate it when I tell you the truth . But listen , man . This is really important . You ca n’t pursue Rebecca now . Or ever . That ’s the definition of sexual harassment . ”
56824	56833	56834	56834	I	0	“ I ’m never going to harass her , ”
56863	56866	56867	56867	His	142	“ Look . ”
56873	56916	56867	56867	His	142	“ You ’re the least sleazy guy in the Fortune 500 . I know that . Rebecca knows that . But it does n’t matter . You do n’t get to behave any differently from the 2000 people who work for you . ”
56917	56954	56955	56955	Stew	142	“ Actually it ’s 1999 , because I just fired you . Such a shame really , since you ’re the number two man in the company . The board is gon na pitch a fit . ”
56962	56985	56958	56958	his	142	“ I ’m sorry , Nate . If she did n’t work for a company you own , it would be different . ”
57025	57028	57029	57029	Stew	142	“ Yum , ”
57032	57035	57029	57029	Stew	142	“ Thanks ! ”
57036	57046	57047	57047	I	0	“ You did n’t have to bring me anything , ”
57067	57094	57058	57058	She	137	“ Do n’t worry . You paid for it . I ’m just trying to make you look a little less gloomy . Is it working ? ”
57095	57098	57099	57099	I	0	“ Sure , ”
57517	57527	57528	57528	he	157	“ That might be a land - speed record , ”
57540	57551	57552	57552	He	157	“ Thanks , man . Sorry for the shitty hour . ”
57555	57564	57552	57552	He	157	“ I ’ll live . Night , boss . ”
57656	57662	57663	57663	Bingley	139	“ Welcome home , Nate , ”
57666	57676	57663	57663	Bingley	139	“ You ’re the only one on the premises . ”
57703	57709	57710	57710	I	0	“ Engage all security systems , ”
57714	57718	57710	57710	I	0	“ Systems engaged . ”
57933	57936	57937	57937	Mom	146	“ Nate ? ”
57946	57955	57937	57937	Mom	146	“ Last night ’s game was very exciting . ”
57956	57962	57937	57937	Mom	146	“ I know , right ? ”
57983	57994	57937	57937	Mom	146	“ You ’re still coming to games three and four ? ”
57995	58009	57937	57937	Mom	146	“ We would love to . Are you sure it ’s no trouble ? ”
58010	58023	57937	57937	Mom	146	“ No trouble to me . I ’m not piloting the Gulfstream . ”
58041	58068	58069	58069	I	0	“ That is a relief , honey . Your father still gets a tense look on his face when he thinks about our old garage door . ”
58133	58140	58141	58141	he	2987	“ It was my last Olds , ”
58156	58165	58168	58168	they	1527	“ normal , well - adjusted Midwestern upbringing . ”
58172	58181	58182	58182	I	0	“ Are you going to stay the week ? ”
58189	58208	58182	58182	I	0	“ We ca n’t , sweetheart . Your father ’s staff meeting on Thursday is non - negotiable . ”
58209	58212	58213	58213	My	0	“ Ah . ”
58232	58259	58225	58225	he	2987	“ You can fly home after the game if he does n’t want to take a personal day . I ’ll set it up that way . ”
58260	58289	58290	58290	I	0	“ Thank you . I ’ll be a little sleepy on Wednesday , but it ’ll be worth it to watch your guys mow down Tampa at home . ”
58714	58721	58722	58722	I	0	“ I ’d better get going , ”
58737	58744	58727	58727	she	127	“ Tell Rebecca I stopped by . ”
58745	58751	58752	58752	she	127	“ I ’ll do that , ”
58759	58767	58752	58752	she	127	“ Thanks for breaking her dry spell . ”
59100	59103	59104	59104	I	0	“ Hi , ”
59122	59133	59134	59134	she	127	“ What are you doing here on a Monday night ? ”
59139	59162	59163	59163	She	127	“ I was going to ask you the same thing , since you are n’t cleared to come back to work yet . ”
59170	59192	59163	59163	She	127	“ I ca n’t do screen work , but I can stress - clean . I ’m not breaking any rules . ”
59193	59213	59214	59214	She	127	“ Stress - clean ? Just a wild guess here . But am I the cause of your stress ? ”
59255	59272	59249	59249	I	0	“ I did n’t mean to question your judgment . Can we talk for a second ? ”
59273	59279	59280	59280	she	127	“ Do we have to ? ”
59284	59287	59288	59288	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
59377	59387	59388	59388	I	0	“ You ’re not answering my calls , Bec , ”
59392	59397	59398	59398	She	127	“ Talk to me . ”
59443	59450	59451	59451	she	127	“ How did you find me ? ”
59459	59468	59451	59451	she	127	“ Since you ’re not taking my calls … ”
59479	59487	59469	59469	I	0	“ First I went to your apartment . ”
59488	59495	59469	59469	I	0	“ My sister ratted me out ? ”
59496	59505	59506	59506	Rebecca	121	“ Nope . But she was awfully chatty . ”
59509	59544	59506	59506	Rebecca	121	“ Yeah . No boundaries on Missy . But that ’s not what ’s bothering you . Can you tell me what ’s the matter ? I can take it . Whatever it is . ”
59553	59560	59561	59561	She	127	“ I just ca n’t believe … ”
59578	59584	59572	59572	Her	127	“ I became that woman . ”
59585	59589	59572	59572	Her	127	“ What woman ? ”
59590	59599	59572	59572	Her	127	“ The one who sleeps with her boss . ”
59607	59616	59602	59602	I	0	“ Really ? You slept with Hugh Major ? ”
59617	59625	59626	59626	Her	127	“ Nate ! That ’s not funny ! ”
59631	59670	59626	59626	Her	127	“ Do n’t you dare pretend to be dense about this . Hugh is my boss , but only on paper . You hired me seven years ago . And you gave me this job with the team . ”
59671	59682	59683	59683	Her	127	“ Sure I did . Because you ’re a professional . ”
59687	59695	59683	59683	Her	127	“ I was n’t on Tuesday night . ”
59696	59720	59772	59772	She	127	“ God , do n’t feel guilty . Because you should n’t . Not at all . Tuesday night was all my fault . ”
59754	59771	59750	59750	She	127	“ I wo n’t let you take all the blame . I was there , too . ”
59802	59810	59811	59811	she	127	“ … But it was a mistake , ”
59814	59848	59811	59811	she	127	“ It ’s not something I can be casual about . Even if I do n’t report to you directly on paper , we both know that you ’re the one in charge . ”
59856	59878	59849	59849	I	0	“ I ’d like to be in charge again , Bec . And I ’m not referring to the hockey team . ”
59879	59884	59885	59885	She	127	“ God , Nate . ”
59891	59900	59885	59885	She	127	“ Yeah , like that . But louder . ”
59914	59929	59903	59903	her	127	“ And here I thought we could just sort of agree to forget it . ”
59930	59938	59885	59885	She	127	“ Because that ’s what you want ? ”
59953	59999	59944	59944	Becca	121	“ I need to forget it . We both know that you ’re one of the most hands - on owners in professional hockey . We work together all the time . I ca n’t be the girl who just casually sleeps with the boss . ”
60028	60031	60032	60032	I	0	“ Look , ”
60035	60068	60032	60032	I	0	“ I got ta call a foul on the idea that our spontaneous naked adventures were somehow job related . You did n’t climb into my lap because you wanted a raise . ”
60081	60108	60077	60077	she	127	“ Be that as it may , I want my job to stay the same . I ca n’t be known as the owner ’s plaything . ”
60117	60129	60109	60109	My	0	“ Do you really think that ’s how I see you ? ”
60130	60140	60141	60141	She	127	“ No . Yes ? I do n’t know . ”
60151	60193	60141	60141	She	127	“ I just want to rewind my life a few weeks when everything was going fine . You told me that I was supposed to focus on my recovery . And now you ’re making it really hard to do that . ”
60257	60260	60261	60261	I	0	“ Okay , ”
60277	60281	60274	60274	Rebecca	121	“ Okay … ? ”
60282	60298	60306	60306	her	127	“ We ’ll forget it ever happened . We ’ll never speak of it again . ”
60299	60303	60274	60274	Rebecca	121	“ All right . ”
60314	60324	60306	60306	her	127	“ Is n’t that what you asked me for ? ”
60329	60332	60333	60333	she	127	“ Yes , ”
60345	60368	60339	60339	She	127	“ I love this job . And I love our friendship . And I do n’t want to sacrifice any of it . ”

60405	60421	60400	60400	She	127	“ Except now I wonder whether those performance evaluations you wrote me were ever unbiased . ”
60498	60518	60519	60519	She	127	“ Look . I do n’t ever want to make you uncomfortable . Tell me how to fix it . ”
60555	60585	60549	60550	This girl	1570	“ We ’ll move on . I ’ll be back at work in a couple of weeks and things can just go back to the way they were before . ”

61137	61153	61154	61154	I	0	“ I ’m not puking on your Nikes . So there ’s your first clue . ”

61288	61295	61283	61283	I	0	“ You guys are miracle workers . ”
61296	61305	61306	61307	the doctor	638	“ You ’re doing all your own healing , ”
61310	61321	61306	61307	the doctor	638	“ We just showed you where to look for it . ”
61322	61327	61328	61328	I	0	“ What ’s next ? ”
61337	61356	61332	61332	He	183	“ The dreaded spinning chair . And then we ’ll have time for one Ping - Pong game . ”

61519	61585	61516	61516	He	156	“ Soon . This early progress is terrific , but vestibular therapy never goes in a straight line . Most patients experience plateaus before they can make further progress . And we ’re asking a lot of your body right now . You need to give the physical work a little more time before you ’re ready to tax your eyesight in an office environment . ”
61588	61591	61592	61592	I	0	“ Okay … ”
61597	61639	61592	61592	I	0	“ How much time , though ? I need to work . I ’ve used up every sick day I ever had , and then some . It would be great if I could tell my boss when to expect me . ”

61755	61788	61750	61751	the doctor	638	“ Get a lot of sleep , and stay active . Then maybe we can discuss a part - time return to work . Would your employer consider an arrangement like that ? ”
61789	61792	61750	61751	the doctor	638	“ Sure . ”
61812	61841	61842	61842	His	638	“ Honestly , it would be good for me to go back part - time . It ’s really stressful not to show my face in the office . ”
61846	61892	61842	61842	His	638	“ I ’m sure I ’d feel the same way . Give it at least one more week at home , okay ? I ’m happy to write a letter to whomever you need , if your continued absence requires a letter in your file . ”
61923	61936	61902	61902	I	0	“ Thanks , I ’ll let you know if that ’s necessary . ”

63130	63152	63112	63112	she	127	“ Gigi — which radio station is covering the game ? I need to hear the play - by - play . ”
63153	63164	63112	63112	she	127	“ Hockey on the radio ? Is that a thing ? ”
63165	63186	63112	63112	she	127	“ Is n’t it ? Old men listen to baseball . You ’re the publicist ! Do n’t you know ? ”
63187	63203	63112	63112	she	127	“ Rebecca , are you okay ? Why are n’t you here watching , anyway ? ”
63239	63259	63230	63230	She	345	“ I ’m all right . It ’s complicated . Just tell me what ’s happening on the ice . ”

63447	63458	63230	63230	She	345	“ The score , Bingley . What ’s the score ? ”
63459	63467	63230	63230	She	345	“ Tie game at 0 - 0 . ”
63468	63479	63230	63230	She	345	“ Okay . What else ? Who has the puck ? ”
63480	63491	63230	63230	She	345	“ The puck is a six ounce black rubber disc . ”
63492	63509	63230	63230	She	345	“ I know that , Bingley . But which player is controlling the puck right now ? ”
63510	63516	63517	63517	Bingley	139	“ One moment , miss , ”
63521	63527	63517	63517	Bingley	139	“ I ’m seeking assistance . ”
63571	63602	63563	63563	Bingley	139	“ Nate reminds you that you need your rest to heal . But he adds that you should come to the stadium if you want to see who ’s playing . ”
63603	63612	63563	63563	Bingley	139	“ Wait , what ? You asked Nate ? ”
63613	63654	63655	63655	I	0	“ Naturally . He ’s my admin . Standby for another communication . Ah . Nate has asked me to send you a car . ETA three minutes . Black Mercedes C class . The driver ’s name is Parker . ”

64111	64143	64144	64144	I	0	“ One - one . We scored to tie it up . End of the second period now . Tampa just rushed the net , but Beacon made a glove save . ”
64229	64235	64236	64236	I	0	“ Do n’t you start , ”

65865	65869	65815	65815	her	128	“ Such as ? ”
65870	65896	65849	65849	she	128	“ Such as — why did you turn bright purple a minute ago during the world ’s shortest conversation with a certain person ’s mom ? ”
65897	65900	65901	65901	I	0	“ Well … ”
65908	65916	65901	65901	I	0	“ Not purple . Red , maybe . ”

66018	66023	66024	66024	she	128	“ Oh my God , ”

66055	66058	66059	66059	She	128	“ Okay . ”
66069	66080	66059	66059	She	128	“ I just have one question . Was it good ? ”
66091	66114	66085	66085	everyone	278	“ Does it even matter ? It does n’t make my life less complicated , so it ’s really beside the point . ”
66115	66125	66126	66126	Georgia	128	“ It is not at all beside the point ! ”
66133	66150	66130	66130	her	128	“ Either you ’re into him or you ’re not . So which way is it ? ”
66151	66181	66085	66085	everyone	278	“ It ’s not that simple . We ca n’t just have an office fling , Georgia . There would be consequences — more for me than for him . ”
66182	66185	66186	66186	She	128	“ Well … ”
66197	66215	66186	66186	She	128	“ That ’s the whole problem , right ? There ’s an imbalance of power between you . ”

66223	66226	66227	66227	She	128	“ N — ”
66231	66289	66229	66229	herself	128	“ Your guy has more power than anyone else I know . But it ’s also his prison . I ’ll bet he ca n’t trust that anyone he meets will ever love him for his own sake . And since his company is his life , anyone he meets there is already in debt to him . ”
66314	66342	66343	66343	Georgia	128	“ Let ’s not get out the violins just yet . Nobody can have everything come easily . What would be the fun of that , anyway ? ”
66346	66373	66343	66343	Georgia	128	“ I know . Did he , uh , say he ’d like to see you again sometime . Out of the office , I mean ? ”
66374	66381	66382	66382	I	0	“ Or bent over his desk , ”

66425	66436	66419	66419	herself	345	“ Remind me to always knock on doors at work . ”
66446	66469	66444	66444	myself	0	“ Actually , you do n’t have to bother . Because I told him we need to just forget the whole thing . ”
66470	66473	66474	66474	Georgia	128	“ Oh . ”
66478	66507	66474	66474	Georgia	128	“ But why ? Because my mind just went straight to candlelit dinners and weekends in Bermuda . Picture the dinner parties you could throw in that mansion ! ”
66516	66563	66508	66508	I	0	“ That is a fairy tale . Reality is far more awkward . What if we dated and it did n’t work out ? I do n’t want to live with the fallout . And besides , I would n’t even know how to be his … ”
66564	66567	66568	66568	Georgia	128	“ Girlfriend , ”
66578	66605	66568	66568	Georgia	128	“ My psyche might not be able to wrap itself around the concept . I used to get his coffee , Georgia . I still do . ”
66606	66609	66610	66612	The bathroom attendant	1700	“ Girl ! ”
66615	66665	66610	66612	The bathroom attendant	1700	“ I ’ll get his coffee till the day I die if it means I get banged by a hot , rich guy in Bermuda . Whoever he is , you got ta give it a whirl . If you do n’t , I ’ll do it for you . ”
66666	66674	66675	66675	Georgia	128	“ She makes a really good point , ”
67212	67221	67206	67206	Bingley	139	“ Master Nate ! Is everything all right ? ”
67222	67226	67206	67206	Bingley	139	“ I guess . ”
67227	67251	67206	67206	Bingley	139	“ Could you repeat that , good sir ? I wo n’t alert the security team if there is no cause for concern . ”
67252	67259	67206	67206	Bingley	139	“ I ’m fine , Bingley . ”
67260	67276	67206	67206	Bingley	139	“ Glad to hear it , sir . Can I help you with anything further ? ”
67325	67328	67329	67329	I	0	“ Bingley , ”

73062	73073	73040	73041	Heidi Jo	208	“ I did n’t know you drank , Heidi Jo . ”
73091	73098	73099	73099	She	208	“ I meant a fruit cocktail ! ”
73121	73130	73118	73118	I	0	“ I would love a Coke . Thanks . ”
73194	73208	73191	73191	Stew	142	“ Twelve minutes , thirty four seconds ! Rebecca Rowley takes the pot ! ”
73229	73234	73216	73216	Stew	142	“ Congrats , Bec ! ”
73261	73272	73273	73274	Heidi Jo	208	“ I guess you ’re the one buying lunch tomorrow , ”
73277	73280	73273	73274	Heidi Jo	208	“ Indeed , ”
73284	73289	73290	73290	I	0	“ Actually , here . ”
73301	73315	73290	73290	I	0	“ It ’s not really fair for the intern to lose her cash . ”
73332	73345	73324	73324	she	208	“ Fair ’s fair . I ’ll prolly win the next one . ”
73369	73400	73363	73363	Stew	142	“ That was a close one , Bec . Three more seconds and you would have been tied . Do you think arm - wrestling would make a good tiebreaker ? ”
73401	73408	73409	73409	I	0	“ I could totally take her , ”
73416	73421	73422	73422	he	142	“ By the way , ”
73428	73449	73425	73425	his	142	“ That was nice of you to offer her the twenty back . But you know she can afford it . ”
73450	73454	73425	73425	his	142	“ I do ? ”
73494	73514	73488	73488	Stew	142	“ Come on , Bec . You do n’t miss much . She ’s the league commissioner ’s daughter . ”
73515	73518	73519	73520	League commissioner	1895	“ The … ”
73522	73529	73519	73520	League commissioner	1895	“ Of the NHL ? Really ? ”
73530	73560	73488	73488	Stew	142	“ Yup . Heidi Jo is Heidi Jo Pepper . Daddy got mad when she dropped out of Bryn Mawr so he sent her to work on a team . ”
73561	73569	73570	73570	Stew	142	“ Oh , hell . Lucky me . ”
73618	73631	73604	73604	She	1761	“ Thank you very much ! That ’s so kind of you , ”
73642	73651	73635	73635	She	1761	“ What did that man just tell you ? ”
73652	73658	73659	73659	I	0	“ Hmm ? What man ? ”
73668	73713	73659	73659	I	0	“ That lottery guy . He told you who my daddy is , right ? And now you ’re gon na be all extra nice . That ’s bullshit , Becca . I ’m just the intern . I do n’t need special treatment . ”
73716	73723	73659	73659	I	0	“ Uh , okay . Sorry . ”
73768	73771	73758	73758	Beacon	148	“ sudden death ”
73820	73828	73829	73829	Stew	142	“ Better luck next time , boys , ”
73832	73835	73836	73836	Georgia	128	“ Nate , ”
73842	73849	73836	73836	Georgia	128	“ We ’ll need you downstairs . ”
73977	73981	73982	73982	Nate	121	“ Miss Rowley . ”
74074	74081	74082	74082	I	0	“ Is there something you need ? ”
74089	74099	74082	74082	I	0	“ And what ’s with this Miss Rowley business ? ”
74125	74143	74122	74122	He	121	“ I was only going to ask if you knew why Alex did n’t show up tonight . ”
74144	74147	74148	74148	I	0	“ No , ”
74152	74172	74148	74148	I	0	“ I have n’t heard from her . It was n’t me who put her on the invite list . ”
74173	74193	74122	74122	He	121	“ I see . I guess I ’ll give her a call tomorrow and make sure she ’s okay . ”
74194	74199	74200	74200	I	0	“ Right . Okay . ”
74205	74209	74200	74200	I	0	“ Good night . ”
74215	74218	74210	74210	I	0	“ And … ”
74221	74224	74210	74210	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
74225	74237	74238	74238	he	121	“ I was n’t trying to be a heel . That … ”
74247	74262	74238	74238	he	121	“ The eager intern called you Miss Rowley . I thought it sounded nice . ”
74263	74266	74267	74267	I	0	“ Nice , ”
74274	74285	74271	74271	He	121	“ To me it sounds like you forgot my name . ”
74354	74366	74350	74350	his	121	“ That was n’t my intent . To make you uncomfortable . ”
74367	74377	74342	74342	he	121	“ You ’re treating me like I have Ebola . ”
74402	74406	74407	74407	Nate	121	“ Poor calibration , ”
74425	74428	74411	74411	he	121	“ What ? ”
74482	74535	74536	74536	I	0	“ It ’s taken me longer than I ’d hoped to recalibrate my reaction to you . My apologies , Rebecca . You were right when you pointed out that this is your place of work , and that it would be wrong to pursue you here . And I have n’t . ”
74543	74559	74536	74536	I	0	“ So this whole Mr. Darcy routine is not because you ’re mad at me ? ”
74560	74563	74564	74564	Nate	121	“ No . ”
74577	74587	74564	74564	Nate	121	“ Not mad at you . Not at all . ”
74665	74678	74658	74658	he	121	“ Look . I ’m sorry I screwed up your … calibration . ”
74679	74692	74658	74658	he	121	“ It ’s entirely my own fault . We discussed this already . ”
74693	74697	74698	74698	I	0	“ Not exactly , ”
74701	74716	74698	74698	I	0	“ I never let you tell me what you thought about the whole thing . ”
74723	74741	74717	74717	He	121	“ By whole thing are you referring to a very hot night in Bal Harbour , Florida ? ”
74742	74748	74749	74749	He	121	“ Of course I am ! ”
74759	74821	74757	74757	him	121	“ But it does n’t matter what I think . The guy who owns your place of employment ca n’t say what he feels . I do n’t want to look like that guy . I do n’t want to be that guy . And now we know my poker face needs work . So I ’ll get right on that . ”
74853	74856	74857	74857	I	0	“ Nate , ”
74860	74903	74857	74857	I	0	“ Tell me what would ’ve happened if you were n’t my boss for seven years . Or even — what if I did n’t say no to breakfast that morning . What would you have said to me over hotel coffee ? ”
74904	74909	74910	74910	He	121	“ Something awkward probably . ”
74915	74974	74912	74912	his	121	“ Look , there are no hypotheticals . You were never just some girl I met at a party . So do n’t ask me to tell you what I think . Not if a little awkwardness sends you into a tailspin . Because I do n’t think you ’re ready for what I ’d have to say . ”
74975	74978	74979	74979	My	0	“ But … ”
74998	75035	74984	74984	I	0	“ What if I had n’t given you a long speech about how the whole thing was a huge mistake ? What would you have said if I let you talk ? Do you even know ? ”
75036	75042	75043	75043	He	121	“ Of course I know . ”
75056	75080	75043	75043	He	121	“ I ’ve thought about it every ten minutes since . I ’ve thought about us during conference calls and while watching hockey . ”
75095	75108	75087	75087	Nate	121	“ I thought about us on the Gulfstream and also in bed . ”
75133	75138	75139	75139	I	0	“ What about us ? ”
75142	75162	75163	75163	He	121	“ What do you think ? In my imagination we are n’t reviewing spreadsheets , that ’s for sure . ”
75173	75190	75191	75191	He	121	“ The only office furniture in this scenario is the desk I ’m bending you over . ”
75196	75222	75193	75193	his	121	“ Does that answer the question ? Or should I go on about what color dress you ’re wearing when I lift it up and … ”
75242	75250	75223	75223	I	0	“ I think I get the idea . ”
75251	75263	75230	75230	him	121	“ And that ’s just off the top of my head . ”
75266	75282	75230	75230	him	121	“ That , uh , jives pretty well with my own thoughts on the matter . ”
75283	75286	75287	75287	His	121	“ Really ? ”
75291	75301	75287	75287	His	121	“ Then why are we avoiding each other instead ? ”
75302	75357	75230	75230	him	121	“ Because it would be fun , but fun ends . Think about it . You ’d run to the end of your playbook pretty quickly and then everything would be doubly awkward . Once you thought it through , you ’d decide we needed to just forget about the whole thing , too . ”
75358	75363	75364	75364	he	121	“ No fucking way , ”
75368	75379	75364	75364	he	121	“ When did you get to be such a pessimist ? ”
75380	75384	75385	75385	I	0	“ Since birth , ”
75389	75395	75385	75385	I	0	“ Have you met me ? ”
75396	75405	75406	75406	he	121	“ You ’re not a pessimist , Bec , ”
75414	75463	75406	75406	he	121	“ You love everyone , except maybe your intern . You planned Georgia ’s wedding like she ’s royalty . The whole fucking team would lie down in the road for you . That ’s not pessimism . That ’s why I do n’t quite buy it now . ”
75464	75467	75468	75468	My	0	“ Well … ”
75482	75493	75473	75473	I	0	“ Maybe I just ca n’t imagine a nice ending . ”
75494	75510	75511	75511	He	121	“ Do you always plan your escape route first when you ’re interested in someone ? ”
75517	75525	75511	75511	He	121	“ I ’m never interested in someone . ”
75539	75546	75534	75534	he	121	“ Are you interested in me ? ”
75547	75583	75473	75473	I	0	“ Were you not listening when I just described how very interesting to me you are ? If I had my way , though , the next thing that happened between us would be dinner . ”
75584	75587	75588	75588	He	121	“ Dinner ? ”
75593	75637	75590	75590	his	121	“ You know . Food consumed near the end of the day ? At a restaurant , because I do n’t cook . Candlelight . You in a low - cut sweater . That ’s what I would have asked for over breakfast . ”
75645	75651	75638	75638	I	0	“ Like , a date ? ”
75652	75658	75659	75659	He	121	“ Like , fer sure . ”
75669	75689	75666	75666	I	0	“ That ’s really sweet . I ’m sorry I threw it back in your face without even asking . ”
75690	75694	75695	75695	he	121	“ Come here , ”
75734	75746	75727	75727	his	121	“ Everything got really tangled up there , did n’t it ? ”
75747	75750	75751	75751	I	0	“ Yes , ”
75767	75776	75777	75777	he	121	“ I ’m sorry to ever distress you , ”
75780	75788	75777	75777	he	121	“ You mean a lot to me . ”
75804	75837	75800	75800	I	0	“ I think I went a little crazy , Nate . You mean a lot to me , too . But so does my job . How did we get so complicated ? ”
75838	75844	75857	75857	his	121	“ Everything worthwhile is complicated . ”
75945	75957	75897	75897	his	121	“ Y’all are needed at the press conference , Mr. K ! ”
75966	75972	75897	75897	his	121	“ Oh gosh — sorry ! ”
76005	76012	76013	76013	Nate	121	“ Be there in a sec , ”
76332	76345	76322	76323	several reporters	1932	“ Mr. Kattenberger , how do you feel about your team ’s … ”
76346	76351	76322	76323	several reporters	1932	“ Mr. Kattenberger … ! ”
76430	76434	76435	76435	Ramesh	157	“ Rough game , ”
76442	76458	76435	76435	Ramesh	157	“ Eh . We can rebuild it . Hey man — one stop before home ? ”
76459	76463	76464	76464	he	157	“ Hit me , ”
76533	76536	76537	76537	Rebecca	165	“ Hello ? ”
76546	76551	76537	76537	Rebecca	165	“ It ’s me . ”
76555	76614	76552	76552	I	0	“ Look , I ’m sorry it ’s so late . I said I would n’t be that creepy guy . And now here I am standing on your doorstep at midnight . Nothing creepy at all about that , right ? You were probably asleep and dreaming about sweaters or something and I wrecked it . Again . ”
76642	76725	76634	76634	I	0	“ But , anyway , our conversation got interrupted at just the wrong time . Or at least I thought it was the wrong time . I just wanted to say that if you ever want to finish that conversation , I ’m here for that . Not literally . I wo n’t show up at midnight every night until you decide to either talk to me or call HR . But if the mood ever strikes , just say the word . ”
76812	76816	76817	76817	Rebecca	165	“ Hi there , ”
76823	76826	76817	76817	Rebecca	165	“ Hi . ”
76862	76871	76872	76872	I	0	“ That ’s a new look for you , ”
76883	76891	76892	76892	she	165	“ This is Renny ’s trench coat , ”
76895	76918	76892	76892	she	165	“ While you ’ve already seen my tiny pajamas , I did n’t want to give the rest of Brooklyn the pleasure . ”
76919	76928	76929	76929	Her	165	“ I meant the , uh , baby . ”
76962	76973	76957	76957	his	1941	“ Did I wake him up ? Are you babysitting ? ”
76974	76981	76982	76982	Becca	165	“ He ’s a night owl . ”
76987	77022	76984	76984	her	165	“ Renny and Missy are home , too . It ’s just that they ’re having very loud sex right now in their bedroom . That ’s why I did n’t invite you up . ”
77053	77060	77061	77061	I	0	“ Listen , I should go , ”
77065	77086	77061	77061	I	0	“ I ’m sorry our conversation was interrupted earlier . Do you want me to say anything to that intern ? ”
77087	77090	77091	77091	Rebecca	165	“ No . ”
77096	77102	77093	77093	her	165	“ I ’ll handle it . ”
77103	77175	77061	77061	I	0	“ Well . Just say the word . But I really came here to say that my dinner invitation does n’t expire , okay ? If you should decide a month from now that the idea is n’t as hateful as you originally thought , just let me know . I ’m not going to ask again , though . Just to stay on the right side of the creepy line . ”
77176	77181	77182	77182	Her	165	“ Oh , Nate ! ”
77211	77224	77203	77203	I	0	“ You could never be creepy . It is n’t like that . ”
77225	77230	77231	77231	Becca	165	“ Good to know . ”
77263	77268	77269	77269	she	165	“ I want to , ”
77273	77276	77269	77269	she	165	“ Hmm ? ”
77277	77285	77258	77258	Maggie	228	“ Dinner . I want to go . ”
77286	77289	77297	77297	she	165	“ Really ? ”
77300	77325	77297	77297	she	165	“ Yeah . But it has to be our little secret . I ’m , um , just trying to feel my way here . ”
77352	77355	77356	77356	I	0	“ Okay , ”
77360	77366	77356	77356	I	0	“ You ’re the boss . ”
77394	77398	77399	77399	I	0	“ Of this , ”
77408	77414	77415	77415	She	165	“ How ’s tomorrow night ? ”
77418	77435	77415	77415	She	165	“ Okay . Sure . I ’m still not sure this is n’t a bad idea . ”
77436	77450	77456	77456	she	165	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll sell you on all the perks . ”
77502	77512	77513	77513	I	0	“ Well , I ’m going to run along , ”
77541	77547	77513	77513	I	0	“ See you at seven ? ”
77548	77551	77552	77552	she	165	“ Seven , ”
77562	77577	77557	77557	She	165	“ Sorry I ’ve been — what did you call it ? Mr. Darcy ? ”
77578	77585	77586	77586	She	165	“ Yeah , you ’re all … ”
77597	77605	77586	77586	She	165	“ … Chilly . Or maybe constipated . ”
77804	77816	77817	77817	I	0	“ That ’s it . I ca n’t eat another bite . ”
77833	77836	77817	77817	I	0	“ Quitter . ”
77959	77974	77954	77954	Nate	121	“ Nice pick , Nate . But I would have been happy with anything . ”
77975	77978	77979	77979	he	121	“ What ? ”
77995	78004	77979	77979	he	121	“ You with the deep opinions about falafel ? ”
78005	78010	78011	78011	I	0	“ Okay — fine . ”
78017	78034	78011	78011	I	0	“ Not just anything . But you do n’t have to impress me with gourmet extravagance . ”
78045	78102	78035	78035	He	121	“ You think I do n’t know that ? You ’re fun , Bec . Next month I ’m going to China with Lauren , and she wo n’t eat the street food I ’m going to want to try . You ’ve always had a good sense of adventure . I love that about you . ”
78205	78209	78195	78195	I	0	“ You know … ”
78215	78224	78210	78210	I	0	“ This is its own kind of adventure . ”
78225	78228	78229	78229	he	121	“ Exactly , ”
78237	78287	78229	78229	he	121	“ And that ’s why we ’re here tonight and not at the falafel shop . I ’m not trying to wow you with the twenty - dollar dessert . Although it was exquisite . I ’m only trying to show you that tonight is not business as usual . ”
78395	78401	78385	78385	he	121	“ Okay , adventure guy . ”
78408	78415	78385	78385	he	121	“ Are you ready to go ? ”
78501	78513	78490	78490	I	0	“ Where ’s Ramesh ? Are you giving him the slip ? ”
78514	78517	78518	78518	Nate	121	“ No . ”
78529	78537	78518	78518	Nate	121	“ I gave him the night off . ”
78538	78546	78490	78490	I	0	“ Really ? Can you do that ? ”
78547	78582	78583	78583	He	121	“ Sure . I mean — some other member of my security team is likely watching a dot move on a screen somewhere , tracking my movements . There is always someone paying attention . ”
78591	78602	78583	78583	He	121	“ That ’s not a selling point , is it ? ”

78702	78733	78688	78688	He	121	“ Ramesh has the night off because I knew if I asked him to drive us back to my place , you would have trouble looking him in the eye . ”
78740	78788	78688	78688	He	121	“ … I also asked one of Lauren ’s minions to make our dinner reservation , because if I had asked Lauren , she would ’ve made me tell her who I was dining with . And you made it clear how you feel about office gossip . ”
78789	78808	78809	78809	I	0	“ That ’s very thoughtful of you . And lovely of you to remain my dirty little secret . ”

79370	79401	79363	79363	he	121	“ If you have a half hour or so . Because I ’m very detail - oriented . In fact , there ’s a PowerPoint presentation I ’ve put together … ”
79415	79420	79421	79421	he	121	“ Not too long , ”

79839	79886	79836	79836	his	157	“ Two heat signatures . If you were on , say , a sofa right now , I would n’t have been confused . But on the stairs ? Looked like a struggle . And you did n’t engage the security systems like you always do . ”
79887	79891	79892	79892	Nate	121	“ Forgot to , ”
79903	79906	79907	79907	Ramesh	157	“ Bye , ”

80969	81006	80964	80964	Her	165	“ That first year especially . But you were taken , and you were my boss . Those two things made it pretty easy to tamp down , when you ’re a practical girl like me . ”

86522	86559	86510	86510	Mickey	148	“ He and I play squash on Thursdays . His backhand makes me feel like an old geezer . Anyway , he knows you and I are close , and he wanted my advice about something . ”

86581	86606	86566	86566	Stew	142	“ Well , think about it . He studies the audio files from your module at home . And suddenly they ’re full of … ”

86711	86774	86687	86687	she	2060	“ Yup . And then I told him to set it up so that you need to okay each day ’s interactions . You ’re going to get an email every morning . If you push a button in that email to send him the files , he ’ll hear them . If you delete the email , the files stay private . ”

86810	86830	86687	86687	she	2060	“ That ’s because you did n’t hear them . I did some of my best work this week . ”
86831	86857	86687	86687	she	2060	“ Congratulations . Can I assume that the beneficiary of your efforts is a certain Bruisers employee ? Or did you take your ambitions elsewhere ? ”
86858	86873	86795	86795	He	2061	“ No . It ’s her . No need to lecture me , though . ”
86874	86896	86687	86687	she	2060	“ Do you hear a lecture ? However you two worked it out , I ’m sure you made HR proud . ”

87033	87059	86962	86962	I	0	“ Smart girl . The practical implications of dating you are n’t really so great . Are you going to put a bodyguard on her ? ”

87080	87087	87071	87073	My best friend	345	“ It ’ll come up someday . ”

88736	88776	88777	88777	She	208	“ How ‘ bout I call the G.M. out here to vouch for us ? He ’s rully busy but he ’s likely getting impatient without us so I ’m sure he ’d be willing to answer your questions . ”

89864	89906	89907	89907	He	2142	“ That ’s because Heidi Jo takes my phone away from me whenever she thinks I ’ve had too much screen time . Do you want her reading your dirty palindromes , or whatever it is you want to text me ? ”
89910	89920	89907	89907	He	2142	“ Dirty palindromes . I could work with that . ”

92630	92680	92623	92623	Becca	121	“ I know what you mean . But you built the team that made it happen . You and Hugh . And you did it for Brooklyn . The bars must be pretty packed tonight . The bartenders probably appreciate it most , now that I think about it . ”
92681	92684	92623	92623	Becca	121	“ Hmm . ”

I can either be the office manager that players listen to , or the office manager that seems like she ’s only there to ogle the players . Women do n’t get the benefit of the doubt . ”

93016	93029	93010	93010	I	0	“ I get it now . I understand why you ’re reluctant . ”
93030	93046	92882	92882	she	2226	“ It ’s worse , you know . Doing the boss . The optics stink . ”
93047	93055	93010	93010	I	0	“ Except the team already trusts you . ”
93067	93106	93107	93107	I	0	“ Sure , but we have new people all the time . To them I ’m gossip at best or a spy . ‘ Watch what you say to her , she ’s sleeping with the owner . ’ ”
93113	93123	93107	93107	I	0	“ But you ’re doing it anyway . Why ? ”
93124	93128	93129	93129	she	2228	“ No idea , ”
93133	93140	93129	93129	she	2228	“ Maybe because you ’re irresistible . ”
93141	93146	93147	93147	I	0	“ You flatter me , ”
93328	93334	93335	93335	she	2228	“ Did your phone die ? ”
93341	93344	93335	93335	she	2228	“ Yes . ”
93350	93360	93345	93345	I	0	“ But I was n’t done talking to you . ”
93361	93370	93371	93371	She	2228	“ You ’re going to ruin my reputation . ”
93385	93423	93376	93376	she	2228	“ First of all , I ’ll leave at hung - over - o’clock . No player is getting up before seven . Secondly , I have a ready excuse if someone sees me leaving your room . ”
93441	93446	93434	93434	I	0	“ What ’s that ? ”
93447	93452	93487	93487	her	2228	“ What ’s what ? ”
93453	93468	93487	93487	her	2228	“ This terrific excuse for why you ’re leaving my room in the morning . ”
93469	93484	93485	93485	She	2228	“ I just had to see the playoffs budget in sweatpants with sex hair . ”
93495	93505	93487	93487	her	2228	“ You wo n’t have sex hair , remember ? ”
93513	93526	93506	93506	I	0	“ Snuggle hair . Bedhead . Whatever . Get under the covers . ”
93576	93583	93588	93588	she	2228	“ You have the best underwear . ”
93606	93623	93588	93588	she	2228	“ Cotton panties during shark week , though . You left your palatial suite for nothing . ”
93624	93630	93631	93631	I	0	“ That is not true . ”
93654	93662	93588	93588	she	2228	“ I ’m on the wrong side . ”
93663	93669	93695	93695	her	2228	“ You have a side ? ”
93670	93679	93680	93680	I	0	“ Left - handed guy on the left . ”
93715	93719	93720	93720	She	2228	“ Come here . ”
93743	93748	93749	93749	I	0	“ That ’s better , ”
93752	93760	93749	93749	I	0	“ This is what I came for . ”
93761	93764	93765	93765	Rebecca	121	“ Okay . ”
93771	93779	93780	93780	I	0	“ You do n’t trust me yet , ”
93791	93796	93784	93784	I	0	“ But you will . ”
93797	93802	93803	93803	she	2228	“ I trust you , ”
93806	93823	93803	93803	she	2228	“ You trust me not to be a dick . You trust me with my dick . ”
93827	93838	93824	93824	She	2228	“ But you do n’t think you could love me . ”
93846	93858	93839	93839	She	2228	“ I did n’t say that . I never said that . ”
93892	93906	93890	93890	Juliet	145	“ Maybe you think I could n’t love you . Is that it ? ”
93907	93910	93911	93911	she	2228	“ Maybe , ”
93914	93917	93911	93911	she	2228	“ Why ? ”
93918	93925	93926	93926	She	2228	“ Because we are so different . ”
93937	93970	93926	93926	She	2228	“ I do n’t like shopping at Bloomingdale ’s . But otherwise we like a lot of the same things . Alien movies . Street food . Let ’s not forget hockey . ”
93971	93974	93975	93975	she	2228	“ Nate , ”
93979	94008	93975	93975	she	2228	“ Do n’t be dense . You ’re a genius and an Ivy League grad . And the head of a Fortune 500 company . I ’m not . ”
94009	94031	94032	94032	She	2228	“ There is nothing stupid about you , though . Not one thing . And leaving school was n’t your fault . ”
94049	94149	94032	94032	She	2228	“ Look , Bec . I do n’t have a PowerPoint to explain why I need you . I just do . I have for a while now , but apparently I ’m not the sharpest scalpel on the tray after all , because it took me too long to say so . But here I am in your bed . I came downstairs because I like your smile and I wanted to see it before I went to sleep . And I ’d like to do that as often as I can , if you ’ll let me … ”
94278	94283	94284	94284	she	2236	“ You scare me , ”
94290	94300	94284	94284	she	2236	“ And I ’m not used to being scared . ”
94321	94345	94303	94303	I	0	“ I ’m not scary . I ’m not even very complicated . But I can be patient until you figure that out . ”
94375	94384	94368	94368	She	2236	“ Now I got you all worked up . ”
94404	94414	94385	94385	Her	2236	“ What are we going to do about that ? ”
94415	94420	94421	94421	I	0	“ Not a thing . ”
94427	94450	94421	94421	I	0	“ I ’m used to being worked up over you . I was for years . Thought it was a permanent condition . ”
94451	94456	94457	94457	she	2236	“ Oh , Nate , ”
94460	94468	94457	94457	she	2236	“ That ca n’t really be true . ”
94469	94474	94475	94475	I	0	“ Sure it is . ”
94494	94552	94553	94553	Rebecca	121	“ I mean , I did n’t allow myself to lie around fantasizing about you . But whenever we were in the same room I ’d get distracted . These days ? I ’m all about the fantasies . In my dreams we ’ve had sex in every civilized country . And much of the developing world . ”
94556	94565	94553	94553	Rebecca	121	“ Really ? What ’s your favorite fantasy ? ”
94566	94569	94570	94570	I	0	“ Mmm . ”
94600	94662	94598	94598	me	0	“ We ’re on a private beach somewhere , playing in the water . And we start fooling around . And then we just ca n’t wait . I have to carry you out of the waves , shove down your tiny bikini , put you on your hands and knees and just fuck you right there on the wet sand . ”
94663	94669	94670	94670	She	2236	“ That does sound nice . ”
94687	94708	94670	94670	She	2236	“ Is there really such thing as a truly private beach ? Or is this an exhibition fantasy , too ? ”
94709	94713	94714	94714	I	0	“ No way . ”
94732	94738	94714	94714	I	0	“ It ’s private because … ”
94753	94806	94714	94714	I	0	“ … That ’s what you do for me . My life is constant noise . Meetings and obligations and two thousand employees . It ’s great , but it ’s loud . When you kiss me , everything goes quiet . That ’s the only time I can forget everyone else . ”
94821	94841	94807	94807	I	0	“ And when I ’m inside you , we ’re all that matters . I crave it so much . ”
94856	94861	94862	94862	she	2236	“ I love that , ”
94865	94877	94862	94862	she	2236	“ I did n’t know I could do that for you . ”
94919	94922	94906	94906	She	2236	“ Bec , ”
94936	94942	94926	94926	she	2236	“ What ’s your fantasy ? ”
94951	94991	94943	94943	Her	2236	“ It ’s simpler than yours . You just push me face down on the bed . I try to talk to you , but you do n’t listen . You just hold me down and go to town . ”
94992	94997	95039	95039	her	2236	“ That ’s not … ”
95012	95019	95006	95006	Becca	121	“ … Very polite of me , ”
95026	95030	95031	95031	She	2236	“ I know . ”
95051	95066	95067	95067	She	2236	“ But some fantasies make more sense in your head than in real life . ”
95143	95146	95147	95147	she	2236	“ Oh , ”
95153	95160	95147	95147	she	2236	“ Can you come like this ? ”
95164	95170	95161	95161	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
95171	95177	95178	95178	We	2242	“ Let ’s find out . ”

95521	95524	95525	95525	Stewart	142	“ Dude , ”
95536	95570	95525	95525	Stewart	142	“ You never take this long to make a decision . I could start a new router company and sell it off in the time it ’s taking you to figure this out . ”
95605	95616	95617	95617	I	0	“ There are over a hundred jobs on the line , ”
95621	95627	95617	95617	I	0	“ Real people with families . ”
95628	95639	95640	95640	Stew	142	“ That ’s an honorable reason to take your time . ”
95653	95685	95640	95640	Stew	142	“ But unless you ’ve taught Bingley to read the future , there ’s no way to know what the other company will ultimately do with it once it ’s theirs . ”
95699	95706	95640	95640	Stew	142	“ I ’m a control freak . ”
95707	95716	95686	95686	He	142	“ You ’re just figuring that out now ? ”
95717	95730	95735	95735	himself	345	“ Do n’t you have some ledgers to go over or something ? ”
95745	95774	95735	95735	himself	345	“ Wait , is this a safe place to sit ? Now that you ’re getting some action again , should I worry what happens on this couch ? ”
95813	95826	95873	95873	I	0	“ Dallas , huh ? Can I tag along to game one ? ”
95827	95833	95873	95873	I	0	“ Sure , why not . ”
95834	95868	95885	95885	her	137	“ I ’m surprised you ’re not off with the team somewhere , watching game tape . ‘ This is the guy you want to hit . Squash him like a bug . ’ ”
95869	95872	95873	95873	I	0	“ Stew … ”
95891	95919	95885	95885	her	137	“ Nate — there ’s a doctor on your line . Armitage . Does that sound familiar ? He says you ’ll know what it ’s about . ”
95920	95929	95930	95930	I	0	“ Ah . I ’ll pick him up . ”
95935	95960	95930	95930	I	0	“ Go . Get out of here . I have to let the doctor shake me down for another contribution for brain injury research . ”
95961	95967	95885	95885	her	137	“ Sounds stimulating . Later . ”
95980	95990	95975	95975	I	0	“ Hello , doctor ! How are things going ? ”
95991	96000	96001	96001	he	2268	“ I was hoping you could tell me , ”
96004	96050	96001	96001	he	2268	“ We have n’t seen Rebecca in nearly two weeks . Has her number changed ? I ’d like to get a hold of her to see if she can come back to therapy , and also have a follow - up visit for testing . ”
96051	96056	96057	96057	I	0	“ Back to therapy , ”
96061	96068	96057	96057	I	0	“ She has n’t been in ? ”
96074	96089	96057	96057	I	0	“ Sorry . I assumed you knew that . I would n’t have asked … ”
96090	96097	96098	96098	I	0	“ No , it ’s fine , ”
96102	96111	96098	96098	I	0	“ She ’s traveling in Dallas right now . ”
96112	96124	96057	96057	I	0	“ Right ! Congratulations , by the way . Big news . ”
96125	96132	96135	96135	myself	0	“ The whole organization is thrilled , ”

96466	96481	96556	96556	he	2280	“ Bingley , have you been talking to Stew ? Is that his joke ? ”
96482	96490	96556	96556	he	2280	“ Yessir . Do you like it ? ”
96491	96516	96446	96446	I	0	“ I happen to think it ’s funny , but it ’s inappropriate . ‘ Do you ’ is an idiomatic expression for sex . ”
96517	96529	96556	96556	he	2280	“ Oh , dear . Thank you for letting me know . ”
96530	96541	96556	96556	he	2280	“ Could you connect me with Dr. Armitage ’s office ? ”
96542	96548	96556	96556	he	2280	“ Right away , sir . ”

96607	96642	96572	96572	I	0	“ He ’s the greatest . Could you help me with something ? I have n’t gotten a bill yet for Ms. Rebecca Rowley ’s office visits . Maybe the insurer is processing them ? ”
96643	96652	96653	96653	I	0	“ Oh , Rebecca ! Let me see … ”
96658	96679	96680	96680	Rebecca	165	“ Those therapy sessions and the doctor visits are out of network . They were applied to a Visa card . ”
96685	96694	96680	96680	Rebecca	165	“ What are the total charges to date ? ”
96695	96702	96653	96653	I	0	“ Three thousand four hundred dollars . ”
96717	96739	96710	96710	Rebecca	165	“ All right , then there ’s been some confusion . Could I possibly give you a different card , instead ? ”
96740	96746	96747	96747	I	0	“ Sure , Mr. Kattenberger . ”
96841	96847	96848	96849	Heidi Jo	208	“ This is rully pretty , ”
96868	96888	96848	96849	Heidi Jo	208	“ I know we ’re just here to win , but the travel team did us a solid here . ”
96929	96932	96933	96934	Heidi Jo	208	“ Look ! ”
96945	96952	96933	96934	Heidi Jo	208	“ Luxury suite , penthouse level . ”
96953	96960	96961	96961	I	0	“ That must be a mistake . ”
96991	96995	96996	96996	I	0	“ Excuse me , ”
97003	97013	96996	96996	I	0	“ I ’m supposed to have a regular room . ”
97014	97023	97024	97024	She	2297	“ No , that was by special request . ”
97037	97045	97024	97024	She	2297	“ Is there a regular room available ? ”
97050	97065	97046	97046	Her	2297	“ I ’m sorry , but the playoffs have the whole hotel booked solid . ”
97074	97081	97082	97083	Heidi Jo	208	“ Here you go , then ! ”
97179	97192	97193	97194	Heidi Jo	208	“ Ooh ! They offer a margarita salt scrub in the spa ! ”
97197	97210	97193	97194	Heidi Jo	208	“ Let ’s see if there are two massage appointments during lunch . ”
97211	97216	97217	97217	I	0	“ You go ahead , ”
97637	97654	97632	97632	He	121	“ Hey ! How ’s Dallas ? Did you make it up to the suite yet ? ”
97666	97737	97740	97740	him	121	“ Where to begin ? Okay , fine . The suite . I said no , and yet here I am anyway . That ’s strike one , especially because Heidi Jo spotted the room change first . So thanks for that . Let ’s just hope she ’s not a gossip . But are you fucking kidding me with the thirty - four hundred smackers on my credit card ? ”
97746	97774	97740	97740	him	121	“ You can go back to therapy now , Bec . This is me trying not to get upset that you are n’t following doctor ’s orders . ”
97775	97780	97781	97781	He	121	“ You ’re upset . ”
97784	97810	97781	97781	He	121	“ I plead the fifth on that . Ca n’t imagine why you would n’t take care of your brain , for fuck ’s sake . ”
97811	97817	97740	97740	him	121	“ I do take care ! ”
97818	97837	97740	97740	him	121	“ Not according to the good doctor , who only called me because he was worried about you . ”
97838	97898	97781	97781	He	121	“ Now you listen here . There are therapeutic exercises that do n’t cost almost three hundo a session ! I ’ve got Pilates at twenty - five bucks a class , and the take - home exercises they gave me . I ’m not an idiot , but thanks for making it clear that you think I am . ”
97899	97910	97740	97740	him	121	“ I did n’t say that . Do n’t exaggerate . ”
97911	97920	97740	97740	him	121	“ Do n’t treat me like a child ! ”
97929	97985	97921	97921	I	0	“ If you had a concern , you could ’ve told me . If you wanted to help me afford the platinum - priced therapy , you could have asked . You say you care about me , but then you pull this bullshit . You care , as long as everything goes your way . ”
97986	97989	97740	97740	him	121	“ Rebecca … ”
97990	98031	97740	97740	him	121	“ Save it , okay ? I have a job to do here . We ’ve been over this . Your suite will be empty when you arrive in Dallas . Stay in your own lane until after the playoffs . ”
98123	98133	98134	98134	I	0	“ How about chocolates shaped like a taxi cab ? ”
98137	98148	98134	98134	I	0	“ I think we should run with the Brooklyn theme . ”

98185	98216	98182	98182	I	0	“ Fine , hockey can be the theme . Or hockey and tennis ! Both your sports . We could alternate . I thought those personalized chocolate bars were cute . ”
98247	98263	98224	98224	Georgia	128	“ Becca , stop it . Nobody cares about chocolate with my name on it . ”
98264	98275	98282	98282	her	128	“ Fine . Little bottles of wine with your names … ”
98276	98279	98280	98280	She	128	“ Stop ! ”
98285	98316	98280	98280	She	128	“ I do n’t care about favors . You are awesome , which is why I have a dress and flowers and a caterer but we are done , okay ? ”
98317	98332	98333	98333	Our	2323	“ Deep breaths . It was only game one . We can rebuild it . ”

99027	99066	99024	99024	Georgia	128	“ But maybe that does n’t matter in Nate ’s head at all . Maybe he ’s just a guy , standing in front of a girl , asking her to climb into a Jacuzzi tub with him . ”

99077	99098	99071	99071	I	0	“ It ’s not like you to be intimidated by Nate . When you met him , were you intimidated ? ”

116512	116524	116507	116507	His	121	“ It ’s okay if it gets wet , you know . ”
116525	116530	116531	116531	I	0	“ Not with me , ”
116534	116544	116531	116531	I	0	“ There ’s a small fortune on my finger . ”
116545	116550	116507	116507	His	121	“ It ’s insured . ”
116553	116576	116577	116577	he	121	“ Listen , I know I just blew your mind a little bit , but I need to blow it some more , ”
116580	116583	116577	116577	he	121	“ Okay ? ”
116627	116641	116615	116615	Nate	121	“ Marrying me is more complicated than dating me . There ’s paperwork . ”
116642	116651	116652	116652	I	0	“ Oh , I do n’t doubt it , ”
116661	116673	116652	116652	I	0	“ I ’ll sign whatever prenup your lawyer can dream up . ”
116677	116691	116652	116652	I	0	“ There has to be a prenup . Can I tell you why ? ”
116692	116700	116615	116615	Nate	121	“ Because you have a billion dollars ? ”
116701	116707	116708	116708	He	121	“ That ’s not why . ”
116721	116761	116708	116708	He	121	“ It ’s because of my voting rights . If someone thought the power structure of KTech could be put into play by our divorce , then someone might decide he has millions to gain by breaking us up . ”
116762	116765	116766	116766	I	0	“ Oh , ”
116770	116775	116766	116766	I	0	“ That ’s creepy . ”
116814	116817	116818	116818	he	121	“ Yeah , ”
116822	116868	116818	116818	he	121	“ So the prenup will have to give me all my KTech shares . But I do n’t think you ’ll care , because there ’s a wedding gift I want to give you . And it ’s important to me that you accept it . ”
116869	116902	116903	116903	His	121	“ Um … I do n’t need anything , Nate . I never really cared about your big bucks , except I do n’t mind when you pick up the dinner check . ”
116914	116918	116919	116919	he	121	“ I know , ”
116976	117009	116966	116966	I	0	“ The gift you ’re getting is a certain hockey franchise . They made a recent run at the championship , and I think they ’ll continue to flourish under new leadership . ”
117010	117013	117014	117014	I	0	“ What ? ”
117034	117070	117026	117026	Nate	121	“ You ’re going to be the new owner of the Brooklyn Bruisers . You wo n’t be shtupping the boss anymore . But I expect to have sex in your office at least once . ”
117084	117090	117071	117071	My	0	“ Own … the team ? ”
117096	117144	117071	117071	My	0	“ Yeah , baby . You ’ll be great . I ’ve had a good run , and you ’re going to be able to give it more attention than I probably should . And nobody loves the Bruisers more , right ? So why not you ? ”
117145	117151	117160	117160	his	121	“ Because it ’s yours ? ”
117152	117157	117158	117158	He	121	“ Not for long . ”
117167	117219	117160	117160	his	121	“ I need you more than I need to own the team . And I want you to have it . We might have to get married before I can sign it over . It ’s because of gift taxes . Or something . My accountant can explain it to you . ”
117304	117311	117312	117312	I	0	“ I still have some questions , ”
117367	117370	117371	117371	Nate	121	“ Shoot , ”
117378	117387	117371	117371	Nate	121	“ Are your parents going to be upset ? ”
117388	117407	117371	117371	Nate	121	“ About what ? My mom loves you . Everyone loves you . We ’ve been over this . ”
117408	117427	117428	117428	He	121	“ But I ’m a shiksa . Do n’t they want you to marry a nice Jewish girl ? ”
117436	117454	117428	117428	He	121	“ News flash — my mom is n’t Jewish . Marrying shiksas is already a family tradition . ”
117455	117458	117459	117459	I	0	“ Really ? ”
117464	117478	117479	117479	I	0	“ Really . If that ’s your big concern , we ’re covered . ”
117507	117510	117511	117511	I	0	“ Nate , ”
117516	117528	117511	117511	I	0	“ I do n’t know anything about being a team owner . ”
117529	117566	117481	117481	his	121	“ But you do . It ’s a job where the major requirement is you pay attention and you care . And nobody cares more than you , Bec ; you ’re going to do great . ”
117567	117575	117511	117511	I	0	“ It ’s just hard to picture . ”
117576	117626	117511	117511	I	0	“ Not for me . You can promote your intern and do less of the grunt work yourself . That frees up your time for more big - picture questions . Some of them are fun . Like — what focus would you choose for the foundation next year ? ”
117627	117632	117633	117633	I	0	“ Head injury research , ”
117637	117640	117633	117633	I	0	“ See ? ”
117647	117667	117641	117641	Nate	121	“ Any work you do there is at least as important as hiring the right vendors in the stadium . ”
117668	117683	117684	117684	Nate	121	“ We ’re in charge of the food ? The cheese puffs are staying . ”
117687	117721	117684	117684	Nate	121	“ Luckily , I ’m leaving you with no immediate problems to solve . Your stadium lease is good for another eight years , and Hugh Major and Coach are n’t going anywhere . ”
117722	117728	117641	117641	Nate	121	“ God I hope not . ”
117729	117785	117641	117641	Nate	121	“ Do n’t worry ! I ’ll always help you . But it wo n’t take you long to realize you already know almost as much about owning a hockey team as I do . And baby — when we need answers , you ’ll just hire some finance nerd or legal geek who knows . ”
117786	117798	117684	117684	Nate	121	“ I ’m going to be in over my head sometimes . ”
117799	117834	117835	117835	He	2683	“ Sure . Like anyone who ever tried something new . I have faith in you . That organization is better with you in it . My life is better with you in it . ”
117848	117859	117835	117835	He	2683	“ Please be my partner in this and all things . ”
117897	117907	117885	117885	Nate	121	“ Will you move in with me right away ? ”
117908	117911	117885	117885	Nate	121	“ I … ”
117925	117928	117915	117915	I	0	“ Sure . ”
117929	117987	117885	117885	Nate	121	“ You can change things in that house , you know . If you do n’t like the setup , we ’ll work on it . But if you do n’t hate it too much , I ’d like to stay . There ’s enough room on the property for the security team to do its job . ”
117988	118015	118016	118016	He	2686	“ Okay . I ’m sure I can find a way to be comfortable in a few of your twelve rooms or however many there are . ”
118021	118060	118016	118016	He	2686	“ I want you to feel at home , Bec . Not just be comfortable . But we ’ll work on it . Meanwhile , your sister and her family will enjoy a little more room , right ? ”
118061	118064	118065	118065	I	0	“ Right … ”
118069	118085	118065	118065	I	0	“ I just signed a new lease . That ought to hold them a while . ”
118086	118090	118091	118091	Nate	121	“ Or forever , ”
118094	118108	118091	118091	Nate	121	“ There ’s a note in your file not to raise the rent . ”
118109	118112	118113	118113	My	0	“ What ? ”
118120	118126	118113	118113	My	0	“ You own that building ? ”
118127	118155	118091	118091	Nate	121	“ Sure . When I built the practice facility I bought up everything that was for sale in the neighborhood . And when you relocated to Brooklyn … ”
118156	118168	118113	118113	My	0	“ The Bruisers ’ real estate agent showed me that apartment . ”
118188	118193	118194	118194	Nate	121	“ That ’s sneaky . ”
118199	118240	118196	118196	his	121	“ You did n’t have to pick that place . But I was happy you did . It let me look out for you in a small way . You know — back when I loved you only from afar . ”
118260	118274	118251	118252	Mr. Darcy	162	“ What kind of wedding do you want ? You can pick anything . ”
118275	118286	118287	118289	The poor man	2687	“ Not sure yet . Many magazines will be consulted . ”
118294	118301	118287	118289	The poor man	2687	“ Can we keep it small ? ”
118302	118305	118251	118252	Mr. Darcy	162	“ Sure ? ”
118306	118338	118251	118252	Mr. Darcy	162	“ I mean — family , close friends , and the hockey team . With you it would be easy to end up accidentally inviting half of KTech and Goldman Sachs . ”
118339	118359	118287	118289	The poor man	2687	“ Why do n’t we rent out a small hotel somewhere in the Caribbean and have a destination wedding ? ”
118360	118366	118251	118252	Mr. Darcy	162	“ That would be fun . ”
118367	118389	118251	118252	Mr. Darcy	162	“ It keeps the numbers down and guarantees you ’ll have to wear a bikini at least part of the time . ”
118390	118399	118287	118289	The poor man	2687	“ You have a one - track mind . ”
118400	118405	118406	118406	He	121	“ No — four . ”
118416	118425	118406	118406	He	121	“ Tech . Hockey . Food . Rebecca . ”
118426	118435	118436	118436	I	0	“ That ’s a lot like my list , ”
118439	118448	118436	118436	I	0	“ Food . Fashion . Hockey . Nate . ”
118449	118457	118458	118458	he	121	“ Three outa four ai n’t bad , ”
118493	118503	118436	118436	I	0	“ Screaming is pretty common on the maternity ward , ”
118518	118531	118436	118436	I	0	“ But it ’s usually about childbirth , and not about hockey . ”
118610	118624	118625	118626	Mrs. Kattenberger	169	“ I thought — this is fine , it ’s not a disaster , ”
118633	118655	118625	118626	Mrs. Kattenberger	169	“ If the series goes to game seven , the baby and I can make an appearance at the Brooklyn arena . ”
118685	118692	118693	118694	Nurse Dawn	261	“ Labor did not progress rapidly , ”
118697	118739	118693	118694	Nurse Dawn	261	“ That ’s normal for a first birth . The doctor wanted to give her an oxytocin drip to move things along , but she said , ‘ Not until the third period . What if we go into overtime ? ’ ”
118816	118848	118849	118849	Dawn	261	“ During a tense part of the game , we reassured nearby patients that everything was just fine . And when Brooklyn won , everyone on the ward was pretty excited , ”
118852	118889	118849	118849	Dawn	261	“ Rebecca ’s baby waited . Things went much faster after we shut off the television . She was ready to push about two hours later , and the baby was born an hour after that . ”
119040	119064	119034	119035	Nurse Dawn	261	“ We had a baby born in the elevator just last week . You got to be pretty creative to catch us unawares . ”
120497	120504	120505	120506	her father	466	“ Why am I even here ? ”
120509	120544	120505	120506	her father	466	“ You said I ’d have veto power over your trades . But I ’m in the building ten fucking minutes when I find out that you took a player I do n’t want . ”
120545	120548	120553	120553	Georgia	128	“ Actually , ”
120618	120621	120607	120607	Nate	121	“ actually . ”
120622	120625	120626	120626	he	121	“ Actually , ”
120630	120652	120626	120626	he	121	“ we grabbed this player one day before you stepped into the building . Totally our prerogative . Read your contract . ”
120653	120664	120665	120666	her dad	529	“ I should n’t have to read my fucking contract ! ”
120669	120709	120626	120626	he	121	“ I put my whole career on the line to lead a team that everyone thinks will fail . You said , Trust me , Karl . I need you , Karl . And then you pull this crap ? ”
120710	120715	120665	120666	her dad	529	“ Legally . . . ”
120716	120740	120626	120626	he	121	“ ‘ Legally ’ is for pussies . That ’s some underhanded shit you just pulled , and a real man admits that . ”
120873	120876	120877	120877	she	128	“ Gentlemen , ”
120953	120956	120957	120958	her father	466	“ Princess ! ”
120961	120972	120957	120958	her father	466	“ I did n’t know you worked for a weasel . ”
120973	120976	120977	120977	she	128	“ Coach , ”
121011	121013	121010	121010	someone	487	“ dad ”
121026	121031	121032	121032	she	128	“ Listen to me , ”
121035	121086	121032	121032	she	128	“ We are expecting thirty or forty reporters in this building today . And there are people out there listening to you two chew each other up . That ’s not what we want in the sports section tomorrow . So you can have this argument using your inside voices . ”
121087	121093	121094	121094	Nate	121	“ He just . . . ”
121103	121126	121097	121097	Georgia	128	“ Your publicist says to tone it down right now , or I ’m sending both of you to the penalty box . ”
121150	121159	121160	121160	he	466	“ We ’re not finished with this conversation , ”
121163	121178	121160	121160	he	466	“ If that kid ’s contract is unsigned , I ’m tearing it up . ”
121179	121183	121184	121184	Nate	121	“ Too late ! ”
121194	121231	121232	121232	He	466	“ They sent us a scan of the signed file last night . Georgia , please add our newest player to your press release . We ’ll have two additions to the Bruisers to announce today . ”
121244	121249	121232	121232	He	466	“ Yes , captain . ”
121462	121465	121466	121466	she	128	“ Now , ”
121470	121478	121466	121466	she	128	“ Let ’s go over the announcement . ”
121514	121541	121505	121505	she	128	“ Nate will introduce you , Coach . I have him leading with your win record at the college level , because it ’s pretty spectacular . ”

121596	121602	121603	121603	She	128	“ Sorry , one sec . ”
121708	121711	121712	121713	her father	466	“ Georgia , ”
121722	121737	121712	121713	her father	466	“ was this the shirt you meant for me to wear with this tie ? ”
121820	121825	121826	121826	she	128	“ You look dashing , ”
121837	121882	121826	121826	she	128	“ Now , can you two play nicely together until after the press conference ? It ’s either that , or you need to double my salary , because I ’ll have to work twenty - four hours a day to undo the damage . ”
121887	121902	121883	121884	Coach Worthington	226	“ I wo n’t shout anymore . But we ca n’t keep this player . ”
121903	121906	121907	121907	Nate	121	“ Bullshit , ”
121910	121922	121907	121907	Nate	121	“ The kid is good . And I got him cheap . ”
121923	121926	121927	121927	she	128	“ Quiet ! ”
121930	121980	121927	121927	she	128	“ I ’m begging you both . Now I need to head into my office for half an hour , before we ’re overrun with reporters . Stay out of trouble until the press conference , okay ? I ’ll fetch you right before I speak to the players . ”
122020	122025	122026	122026	He	466	“ Okay , honey . ”
122058	122061	122062	122062	she	128	“ Whoa , ”
122092	122125	122126	122126	Nate	121	“ Christ , Princess ! Are you okay ? Should you be wearing those things ? I thought you swore off heels after that incident at your eighth grade graduation . . . ”
122145	122159	122139	122139	She	128	“ Coach , a favor ? Do n’t call me Princess at work . ”
122185	122191	122192	122192	he	121	“ Sorry , Miss Worthington , ”
122312	122315	122316	122316	she	128	“ Morning , ”
122325	122328	122329	122329	he	231	“ Morning ! ”
122332	122351	122329	122329	he	231	“ I ’m going for donuts in a few minutes . You want jam - filled or chocolate ? ”
122388	122391	122392	122392	she	128	“ Jam , ”
122405	122413	122414	122414	He	231	“ Thanks . You ’re the best . ”

122753	122765	122740	122740	Becca	141	“ Not too bad . I got in late last night . ”
122821	122826	122827	122827	Becca	141	“ Welcome to Brooklyn , ”
122833	122841	122827	122827	Becca	141	“ Are you familiar with the area ? ”
