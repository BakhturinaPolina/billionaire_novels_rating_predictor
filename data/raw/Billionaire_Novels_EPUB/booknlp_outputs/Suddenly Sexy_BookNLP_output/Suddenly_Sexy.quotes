172	179	168	168	Linda	60	" You do n't look well . "
180	192	164	166	her older sister	134	" I 'm fine . Must 've been something I ate . "
193	208	209	209	Maddie	31	" You did n't swallow any chemicals at the lab again , did you ? "
235	246	248	248	Sam	32	" I never realized being a scientist was so dangerous , "
258	270	248	248	Sam	32	" She 's joking . I 've never swallowed any chemicals . "
297	306	287	287	She	31	" Well , there was that one time — "
307	310	311	312	Her sister	133	" Linda ! "
331	340	322	322	she	133	" Do n't you have children to raise ? "
349	377	378	378	She	60	" I do n't hear screaming coming from the living room , which means David and Emily have either killed each other or are up to mischief . "
399	419	394	394	himself	37	" And he 's doing fine without parental influence , so no , I think I 'll stay here . "
428	438	439	439	Sam	32	" When did you say Pete would be home ? "
620	631	632	632	Maddie	31	" So how long are you here for , Sam ? "
660	693	646	646	He	148	" Not sure yet . I 'm on a wait - and - see basis . Go with the flow , see how things pan out . You know how it is . "
703	706	696	696	she	31	" Oh . "
1061	1068	1069	1069	he	148	" Still looking for Miss Right , "
1081	1086	1087	1087	Maddie	31	" Ms . Right , "
1162	1165	1166	1166	Sam	32	" Sorry , "
1169	1188	1166	1166	Sam	32	" I did n't realize ' Miss ' was an unacceptable title in the twenty - first century . "
1215	1223	1209	1209	She	31	" It 's just politically incorrect nowadays . "
1290	1308	1309	1309	he	148	" I 'll try to remember that next time I 'm speaking about a matrimonially challenged female , "
1393	1404	1405	1405	Linda	60	" Those kids are way too quiet for my liking , "
1413	1425	1405	1405	Linda	60	" I 'd better make sure they still have their hair . "
1431	1443	1405	1405	Linda	60	" David chopped Emily 's off a couple of weeks back . "
1444	1463	1405	1405	Linda	60	" Ah , that explains the crew cut . I thought she was trying for the tomboy look . "
1464	1469	1470	1470	Maddie	31	" She 's three , "
1473	1483	1470	1470	Maddie	31	" She 's too young to have a look . "
1491	1512	1470	1470	Maddie	31	" Sorry , but I do n't know what 's in the mind of a three year - old girl . "
1580	1597	1598	1598	Linda	60	" Make sure Ronan does n't try to climb out of his high chair , Maddie , "
1633	1638	1640	1640	Sam	32	" Uh , Maddie , "
1656	1659	1642	1642	She	31	" What ? "
1660	1664	1642	1642	She	31	" The gravy ... "
1665	1669	1670	1670	Sam	32	" Oh no ! "
1698	1707	1708	1708	she	31	" You watch the pots on the left , "
1711	1730	1708	1708	she	31	" and I 'll take the right . I do n't know how Linda does this every day . "
1731	1742	1688	1688	He	32	" I guess it 's something you get used to . "
1743	1750	1688	1688	He	32	" I doubt I ever could . "
1751	1782	1708	1708	she	31	" Sure you would . When the time 's right for you . Personally , I love it . Nothing like kids running around the house to make life interesting . "
1789	1794	1783	1783	Maddie	31	" You like kids ? "
1795	1799	1708	1708	she	31	" Of course . "
1876	1885	1886	1886	he	32	" Three kids and another on the way , "
1895	1906	1886	1886	he	32	" Who 'd have thought your sister would settle down ? "
1907	1943	1957	1957	He	32	" Not me . I thought I 'd be the one with a husband and family by the time I was thirty and my sister would be the charity case I had over to dinner . "
1972	1982	1957	1957	He	32	" You do n't look like a charity case . "
2011	2020	2021	2021	he	32	" Linda 's changed a lot since school , "
2025	2057	2021	2021	he	32	" I remember her as a party animal . Never still for one second , always wanting to go out . I do n't know how Pete kept up with her . "
2058	2064	2021	2021	he	32	" He got her pregnant . "
2065	2077	2021	2021	he	32	" Has n't slowed her down from what I can see . "
2078	2100	2101	2101	She	31	" She 's only fourteen weeks . Wait till she 's eight months and see her waddle after the other kids . "
2104	2124	2101	2101	She	31	" Last time she perfected the art of shoe throwing . David soon learned he could n't dodge it . "
2128	2162	2125	2125	Sam	32	" I guess apart from the kids , the house in the ' burbs and the shorter hair , your sister has n't changed much . She 's still the same bubbly Linda . "
2163	2170	2171	2171	He	32	" You mean scatter - brained . "
2177	2184	2171	2171	He	32	" I did n't say it . "
2185	2209	2125	2125	Sam	32	" It 's okay , I 'll take the heat if she overhears . I 've been calling her that my entire life . "
2263	2276	2277	2277	he	32	" She 's not the only one that 's changed around here , "
2399	2402	2403	2403	she	60	" Maddie , "
2406	2419	2403	2403	she	60	" you were supposed to make sure Ronan did n't kill himself . "
2420	2423	2427	2427	she	133	" What ? "
2452	2464	2436	2436	Ronan	37	" He is n't hurt is he ? I got distracted . "
2485	2489	2476	2476	She	60	" I bet . "
2510	2519	2495	2495	Linda	60	" All present and accounted for in there ? "
2520	2533	2495	2495	Linda	60	" Yes , but the walls are now decorated with pretty butterflies . "
2541	2548	2495	2495	Linda	60	" Sounds like Daddy 's home . "
2564	2573	2574	2574	He	38	" Hey , how 's my main man ! "
2587	2595	2596	2596	Sam	32	" It 's good to see you . "
2599	2612	2596	2596	Sam	32	" Good to see you too , Mate . Been a while . "
2613	2633	2574	2574	He	38	" Too long . So you going to tell us what the heck you 're doing back in Melbourne ? "
2634	2637	2638	2638	Pete	38	" Heck ? "
2641	2682	2638	2638	Pete	38	" Yeah . Anything stronger than that and David 's kindergarten teacher will let me know about it . The kid 's a sponge . Soaks up everything I say then spouts it all out at kindy the next day . "
2683	2704	2574	2574	He	38	" It makes a nice change to the swear words you used to use . Your vocabulary was pretty colorful . "
2705	2711	2574	2574	He	38	" Mine ! What about — "
2712	2715	2716	2716	Linda	60	" Pete , "
2723	2731	2732	2732	She	60	" Not in front of the kids . "
2743	2755	2756	2756	Sam	32	" I do n't know how long I 'm here for , "
2768	2779	2756	2756	Sam	32	" Maybe a few days , maybe a few weeks . "
2780	2790	2791	2791	Pete	38	" Try to make it as long as possible , "
2794	2807	2791	2791	Pete	38	" This is gon na be great . Just like old times . "
2863	2869	2870	2870	he	38	" So much to discuss , "
2873	2896	2870	2870	he	38	" Fifteen years and not a word and then you call out of the blue . Jeez , where do we start ? "
2919	2933	2914	2914	Sam	32	" Good to see the Aussies beating the Kiwis again in the cricket . "
2963	2968	2957	2957	Pete	38	" What a fantastic — "
2969	2974	2976	2976	Linda	60	" Uh , guys , "
2978	2989	2976	2976	Linda	60	" we 're not interested in hearing about the cricket . "
2990	3002	3003	3003	Pete	38	" Then we 'll take this out to the back porch . "
3017	3026	3027	3027	she	206	" We want to talk to Sam too , "
3030	3038	3027	3027	she	206	" Too bad , he 's mine . "
3102	3109	3110	3110	Linda	60	" Did you see his butt ? "
3118	3134	3110	3110	Linda	60	" Oh my God , has that man got a behind that I could just — "
3135	3144	3166	3166	Maddie	31	" Linda ! You 're a married woman . "
3145	3165	3110	3110	Linda	60	" Nothing wrong with window shopping . Besides , you 're single . I was ogling on your behalf . "
3240	3248	3249	3249	Maddie	31	" I know what you 're thinking , "
3252	3264	3265	3265	Linda	60	" and do n't . That guy is not my type . "
3268	3286	3265	3265	Linda	60	" Not this again . When are you going to give up on this perfect man theory ? "
3287	3306	3265	3265	Linda	60	" It 's not a theory , it 's my standard . Every woman should have a standard . "
3307	3317	3265	3265	Linda	60	" Maybe you should n't set yours so high . "
3348	3356	3357	3357	Linda	60	" My criteria are n't that tough . "
3360	3370	3357	3357	Linda	60	" Tough enough that no man can meet them . "
3371	3391	3329	3329	She	31	" Is it my problem there are n't any intelligent , honest , interesting and sensitive men out there ? "
3392	3492	3493	3493	Maddie	31	" There 's plenty . You just add too many other ingredients to the recipe . Like neatness , has to get on with Mum and likes kids . If I were you , I 'd give up on the liking Mum part . That 's asking a bit much . And neatness is over - rated . All you can expect from a man is that he does n't wear the same pair of underwear more than once before he puts it in the laundry basket and he takes the rubbish out . Not necessarily in that order . "
3504	3513	3495	3495	her	31	" I 'm not living with a slob . "
3522	3533	3514	3514	Linda	60	" You 're thirty now , Sis . Tick tock . "
3553	3568	3543	3543	She	31	" I 've got plenty of time to settle down and start a family . "
3569	3585	3586	3586	She	31	" Nice try , Mad , but I know you do n't really think that . "
3594	3601	3589	3589	Linda	60	" I know about your Plan , "
3734	3786	3787	3787	she	60	" Let 's look at this logically . Say you meet a guy today . You 'll want to date for two years before you marry , then you should be married for a couple of years before you start a family . Two years between each kid will make you , "
3799	3819	3787	3787	she	60	" nearly forty by the time you have the fourth . Jeez , Mad , you better get started . "
3820	3874	3787	3787	she	60	" I do n't want four , I want two . Two 's perfect . Three creates middle child syndrome and four means a bigger car . Two 's ideal . As to the rest , who 's to say I wo n't fall instantly in love and get married within six months ? "
3875	3916	3787	3787	she	60	" I know you , that 's what makes me say it . You 'll need two years just to organize the damn wedding . Besides , it 'll take you that long to find every quirk in his personality . "
3920	3935	3917	3917	Maddie	31	" Well , whatever his assets , I am not interested in Sam Hennessy . "
3936	3950	3787	3787	she	60	" Why not ? If I recall , Mum used to like him . "
3951	3970	3971	3971	She	31	" I do n't care what Mum thinks ! This has got nothing to do with my criteria . "
4008	4026	4002	4002	Linda	60	" Stop fussing and tell me what the problem is . What 's wrong with Sam Hennessy ? "
4027	4030	4002	4002	Linda	60	" Okay . "
4080	4086	4087	4087	Linda	60	" So wear Pheramour forever , "
4099	4112	4087	4087	Linda	60	" That 's what I thought too . But I ca n't . "
4113	4138	4141	4141	her	31	" Why not ? This is Sam Hennessy . He 's worth a bath every day in that stuff . He 'll never know . "
4170	4198	4161	4161	Her	31	" I ca n't . It 's not right . It 's not fair . Besides , I 've noticed other men are falling for it too . "
4199	4209	4141	4141	her	31	" Really ? Like who ? I want details . "
4210	4214	4161	4161	Her	31	" Remember Justin ? "
4215	4221	4161	4161	Her	31	" The man - boy ? "
4225	4246	4161	4161	Her	31	" We bumped into him yesterday . He said I looked good . He never used to give me complements . "
4247	4284	4285	4285	She	31	" That 's because he 's a jerk . So do you think he wants you back ? I hope so . I hope he wants you bad . Make him suffer , he deserves it . "
4312	4331	4287	4287	her	31	" But that 's not enough , Mad . Two men do n't make Pheramour a raging success . "
4332	4386	4287	4287	her	31	" It was happening all day . Men kept looking at me . I thought I had something hanging from my nose , but I did n't . Once , when Sam was n't around , a guy asked me on a date . Just like that ! It took him two minutes . "
4387	4397	4287	4287	her	31	" Wow . I guess it is working then . "
4426	4439	4440	4440	She	133	" Wait a minute . Pete does n't think you 're attractive . "
4443	4447	4440	4440	She	133	" I hope . "
4448	4478	4505	4505	Linda	60	" It does n't work on all men . I ’m not sure why . It must have something to do with the unique chemical make - up that — "
4479	4486	4487	4487	Linda	60	" Enough of the science talk , "
4579	4588	4589	4589	she	31	" I think I 'm going to cry , "
4607	4612	4596	4596	Linda	60	" This is terrible . "
4613	4617	4589	4589	she	31	" I know . "
4618	4644	4645	4645	Maddie	31	" This could be the end of society as we know it . Morals , human sexuality and behavior , everything 's going to change . "
4661	4673	4656	4656	She	133	" You 're not talking about Sam and me are you ? "
4674	4707	4650	4651	Her sister	133	" No . Pheramour . What if people start wearing it and other people — complete strangers , people 's husbands — fall for it ? There 'll be total sexual chaos . "
4798	4808	4809	4809	she	31	" I think I need to talk to Miles , "
4881	4885	4886	4886	he	38	" Hey Maddie , "
4889	4894	4886	4886	he	38	" how 's things ? "
4895	4910	4911	4911	Emily	36	" Oh , fine , except I 'm about to create total sexual chaos . "
4928	4958	4959	4959	He	38	" Yeah ? Cool . Give me a few days warning so I can stock up on c - o - n - d - o - m - s. "
4975	4980	4968	4968	she	60	" I was kidding ! "
4981	5000	5001	5001	Linda	60	" Yeah , well it 's not funny . And you 're all sweaty . Where 's ... ? "
5013	5031	5001	5001	Linda	60	" Sam ? He 's coming . He wanted to do an extra lap of the street . "
5032	5038	5043	5043	they	235	" Sam 's coming here ? "
5068	5078	5043	5043	they	235	" Linda , why did n't you say something ? "
5079	5103	5104	5104	Her	60	" I thought it would be a nice surprise . He rang Pete this morning and asked him to go for a run . "
5117	5122	5123	5123	she	60	" Do n't worry , "
5138	5154	5123	5123	she	60	" It looks like it was a tough run . Probably Sam'll look awful too . "
5189	5194	5195	5195	Pete	38	" Hey , Mad , "
5200	5231	5232	5232	He	38	" Sam could n't stop talking about you . He said he had a good time yesterday , but you went cold on him after you fell in the water . "
5240	5250	5232	5232	He	38	" He wants to know what the problem is . "
5251	5258	5259	5259	Linda	60	" And what did you say ? "
5262	5269	5259	5259	Linda	60	" That she probably had PMS . "
5270	5273	5274	5275	both women	238	" Pete ! "
5278	5314	5274	5275	both women	238	" What ? What 's wrong with that ? Besides , what other explanation is there ? It 's Sam Hennessy for crying out loud . Why else would you give him the cold shoulder ? "
5352	5358	5359	5359	She	31	" I have to go . "
5372	5375	5368	5368	Sam	32	" Maddie ! "
5469	5481	5482	5482	he	38	" I did n't think you were going to be here , "
5524	5538	5539	5539	She	31	" And I did n't know you were coming . If I had ... "
5550	5558	5547	5547	her	31	" Anyway , I was just leaving . "
5559	5565	5567	5567	Linda	60	" No you were n't , "
5569	5578	5579	5579	She	60	" You were staying for lunch , remember . "
5638	5645	5630	5630	She	31	" Yeah , I 'm staying . "
5646	5649	5650	5650	Linda	60	" Great . "
5658	5696	5650	5650	Linda	60	" Sam , go take a shower . Pete , take the kids outside to play until Sam gets out and then it 's your turn . Maddie , you can change Ronan while I prepare lunch . "
5705	5712	5697	5697	Maddie	31	" I thought I smelled something . "
5775	5784	5786	5786	Linda	60	" Pete , help me with the dishes , "
5790	5798	5786	5786	Linda	60	" Maddie , will you watch Ronan ? "
5799	5807	5809	5809	Pete	38	" Why do I have to help ? "
5811	5835	5809	5809	Pete	38	" Ca n't Maddie ? Is n't that what you girls do , go into the kitchen and discuss the meaning of life ? "
5836	5840	5841	5841	Linda	60	" Not today , "
5853	5859	5860	5860	Pete	38	" Why are you winking ? "
5863	5872	5860	5860	Pete	38	" Have you got something in your eye ? "
5888	5891	5893	5893	Sam	32	" Subtle , "
5950	5966	5967	5967	Emily	36	" I 'm glad they left us on our own . We need to talk . "
6017	6023	6024	6024	He	32	" Maddie , about yesterday . "
6028	6033	6024	6024	He	32	" I 'm sorry . "
6034	6037	6038	6038	she	31	" Oh , "
6042	6046	6038	6038	she	31	" what for ? "
6053	6059	6047	6047	He	32	" For being a jerk ? "
6112	6122	6123	6123	she	31	" It 's not you , it 's me , "
6126	6136	6123	6123	she	31	" Gee , where have I heard that before ? "
6145	6159	6160	6160	He	32	" I think I 've used that one in half my relationship breakups . "
6184	6199	6200	6200	She	31	" So this is what it feels like to be on the other end ? "
6212	6230	6200	6200	She	31	" It happens to be true on this occasion . Look , it 's nobody 's fault — "
6231	6234	6235	6235	he	32	" Aha , "
6240	6255	6235	6235	he	32	" there 's another one . Also on my list of favorite breakup lines . "
6268	6370	6264	6264	his	32	" How about ' I need to find myself ' , that 's a good one . I used that on a spiritualist and she totally fell for it . And then there 's ' We want different things ' which I wish I 'd used on my ex . She wanted my money and I wanted her out of my life . For a year after my father died I found ' I need some time ' went down a treat . Follow that up with ' You 're so sweet for understanding ' and you 're on a winner . "
6386	6398	6383	6383	his	258	" Any of those suit ? Feel free to borrow one . "
6431	6446	6423	6423	he	258	" Sam , I 'm sorry , but you 'll thank me one day . "
6460	6476	6454	6454	Pheramour	48	" There 's another good one . Ca n't recall ever using it myself though . "
6477	6482	6483	6483	He	258	" Sam , please . "
6513	6538	6539	6539	He	258	" Maddie , against my better judgment , I 'm going to lay it on the table . I like you . A lot . "
6552	6588	6589	6589	He	258	" I know we 're not really in a relationship , but we have known each other forever , so I think we can skip all the dating crap . So here 's the thing . "
6607	6634	6635	6635	He	258	" I want to see more of you . I have no idea what I said to upset you yesterday , but I apologize for it . "
6638	6657	6635	6635	He	258	" I confess , I 'm just a dumb guy when it comes to figuring out women , but- "
6658	6666	6589	6589	He	258	" Stop it , Sam . Please . "
6667	6673	6674	6674	He	258	" I 'm not finished . "
6685	6720	6674	6674	He	258	" I ca n't remember ever being attracted to someone the way I 'm attracted to you . I ca n't get enough of you . It feels like I 'm on a drug . "
6726	6740	6723	6723	he	258	" That 's got to account for something , do n't you think ? "
6786	6797	6778	6778	Sam	32	" Maddie , I want to see more of you . "
6816	6829	6830	6830	She	31	" No , Sam . We ca n't . End of story . "
6874	6885	6862	6862	She	31	" There , now you can both play with her . "
7325	7338	7339	7339	she	266	" Sammy , honey , did you enjoy your jog with Pete ? "
7380	7392	7393	7393	She	266	" Yeah , the jog was fine . Lunch afterwards sucked . "
7401	7413	7393	7393	She	266	" Sit down and tell your old mother all about it . "
7418	7432	7393	7393	She	266	" I do n't want to talk about it . It 's private . "
7433	7445	7456	7456	she	266	" I 'm your mother . Nothing is private from me . "
7480	7506	7507	7507	He	32	" If that boy , Pete Murphy , is giving you a hard time , you let me know . I 'll straighten him out . "
7510	7516	7507	7507	He	32	" It 's not Pete . "
7517	7555	7556	7556	she	266	" I never did like him . He 's a bad influence on you . I do n't know how that Linda Clarke put up with him for so long . Not that she was much better , "
7562	7601	7556	7556	she	266	" Always getting into trouble . She used to give her poor mother a nasty rash every time she was caught escaping out the window . Definitely a bad influence . Not like that lovely sister of hers . "
7602	7612	7507	7507	He	32	" Maddie . Yeah , she 's just lovely . "
7631	7664	7665	7665	She	266	" Mum , we 're not sixteen anymore and Pete 's an okay guy . Linda 's a little loopy still , but I like her . And their kids are great . "
7670	7688	7667	7667	her	266	" Imagine two irresponsible people like Pete and Linda bringing up children . I shudder to think . "
7689	7697	7698	7698	She	266	" Mum ! They 're great parents . "
7753	7771	7746	7748	that wayward teenager	295	" Besides , I think I was a worse influence on Pete than he was on me . "
7772	7783	7792	7792	She	266	" Nonsense . You were just going through a phase . "
7797	7811	7792	7792	She	266	" Anyway , you were going to tell me what 's bothering you . "
7812	7819	7792	7792	She	266	" No , I was n't . "
7820	7838	7839	7839	He	291	" Do n't be silly . If it 's not Pete , then what happened over lunch ? "
7850	7853	7848	7848	she	266	" Sit down "
7925	7933	7916	7916	She	266	" I know what the problem is . "
7934	7938	7916	7916	She	266	" You do ? "
7939	7970	7916	7916	She	266	" It 's the children . They were being obnoxious . All that shouting and running around — it 's enough to give one a headache . Children should be — "
7971	7997	7916	7916	She	266	" No , Mum . The kids are fun . I told you that . I love kids , despite the shouting and running around . "
8099	8106	8107	8107	she	31	" So what was the problem ? "
8111	8122	8107	8107	she	31	" The food ? Did that Linda Clarke feed you — "
8123	8126	8127	8127	He	291	" Enough . "
8151	8160	8148	8148	He	291	" It 's Maddie . She was there . "
8161	8181	8148	8148	He	291	" Linda 's sister ? I thought you liked her . You went on a date with her yesterday . "
8182	8195	8196	8196	His	291	" Yeah , I like her . She does n't like me . "
8219	8249	8207	8207	She	266	" How can she not like you ! You 're handsome , healthy , rich and you have all your own hair . What more would a woman want ? "
8276	8289	8290	8290	she	266	" That 's just ridiculous . Not like my Sammy ? No , "
8293	8330	8290	8290	she	266	" No , no , no . Not possible . All the girls like you . They always have . When you were a boy , I used to hang up on them all the time . "
8331	8343	8344	8344	She	266	" You hung up on girls who called me ? Mum ! "
8349	8367	8346	8346	her	266	" Only the ones I did n't like . Anyway I have n't done it in years . "
8368	8380	8381	8381	He	305	" That 's because I have n't lived here in years . "
8435	8445	8446	8446	he	305	" I think it 's time I moved out , "
8449	8455	8446	8446	he	305	" Get my own place . "
8456	8472	8473	8473	She	266	" But you just got back . Ca n't you stay here a little longer ? "
8486	8507	8473	8473	She	266	" It 's been lovely having you home again . The house has missed you . I 've missed you . "
8522	8555	8556	8556	She	309	" We 're cramping each other 's style , Mum . Just yesterday you said you were having a friend over , but when I came home early you changed your mind . "
8567	8589	8556	8556	She	309	" Do n't worry about me , Sammy , you just go about your business like this is your home again . "
8611	8654	8655	8655	She	309	" Mum , I 'm thirty - two . I need to have my own place and so do you . Besides , I 've lived on my own for fifteen years and living here makes me feel like a kid again . "
8669	8672	8655	8655	She	309	" So ? "
8674	8680	8681	8681	he	311	" I need my space , "
8684	8692	8681	8681	he	311	" So you can have women over ? "
8693	8701	8702	8702	She	309	" So you can have men over . "
8720	8722	8716	8716	He	311	" Gotcha "
8978	8987	8975	8975	He	311	" Mum , I 'm not a kid . "
8988	8994	8995	8995	she	266	" Everyone needs their calcium , "
9001	9010	9011	9011	She	266	" including thirty - two year old men . "
9022	9041	8995	8995	she	266	" Now , tell me why Maddie Clarke does n't like my boy . What did you do ? "
9042	9045	9046	9046	He	311	" Nothing ! "
9049	9063	9046	9046	He	311	" And since when is it my fault ? Before , you said — "
9064	9111	8995	8995	she	266	" I know what I said , but now that I 've had time to think about it , I realized you must have said something to upset her . Perhaps she 's jealous . Women always liked you , and if she saw you with — "
9112	9118	9120	9120	she	323	" She 's not jealous . "
9150	9174	9120	9120	she	323	" You must have done something . Sensible girls like Maddie Clarke do n't break up with boys like you for no reason . "
9175	9180	9120	9120	she	323	" Boys like me ? "
9181	9189	9190	9190	She	323	" Yes . You know the sort . "
9199	9242	9190	9190	She	323	" Always getting into trouble , talking back to the teachers and parents . Girls always like those kind of boys . Even the sensible girls . And you were such a rebellious boy , and she was such a sweet girl . "
9264	9281	9261	9262	their mothers	328	" Well , she does n't like me , but I like her . A lot . "
9292	9314	9282	9283	His mother	266	" Then go talk to her . Trust me . She likes you . She 's just playing hard to get . "
9328	9353	9354	9354	She	266	" I doubt it , Mum , but thanks . I think I will go and see her . She 's worth another try . "
9368	9391	9360	9360	she	266	" Good . And when you get back we can go through the weekend papers and look for a house for you . "
9397	9405	9392	9392	He	311	" You 've changed your tune quick . "
9406	9425	9426	9426	He	311	" I thought about it in the kitchen and you 're right . You are cramping my style . "
9429	9435	9426	9426	He	311	" What 's his name ? "
9450	9456	9436	9436	She	266	" Kevin . Kevin Bowcher . "
9457	9463	9464	9464	He	311	" That name sounds familiar . "
9477	9488	9467	9467	he	311	" Did n't I go to school with his daughters ? "
9497	9515	9467	9467	he	311	" Uh , yes . You dated them both . More or less at the same time . "
9516	9521	9522	9522	She	266	" Oh , yeah . "
10520	10523	10524	10524	His	32	" Holy ... "
10552	10554	10546	10546	He	32	" help "
10593	10607	10608	10608	His	32	" Is that what you always wear on a Sunday afternoon at home ? "
10628	10635	10624	10624	his	32	" Or are you expecting someone ? "
10636	10640	10641	10641	She	31	" Just Linda . "
10670	10681	10655	10655	He	32	" Do you always dress like this for your sister ? "
10705	10709	10710	10710	She	31	" Like what ? "
10730	10736	10723	10723	He	32	" Um , never mind . "
10762	10769	10753	10753	she	31	" Sam , is something wrong ? "
10770	10774	10775	10775	he	32	" Hell no , "
10784	10791	10775	10775	he	32	" Then why are you here ? "
10792	10806	10753	10753	she	31	" Huh ? Oh , yeah . I need to talk to you . "
10807	10810	10753	10753	she	31	" About ? "
10811	10818	10775	10775	he	32	" Can I come in first ? "
10819	10822	10823	10823	His	32	" No . "
10846	10860	10835	10835	She	31	" Go on . Let me in . This wo n’t take long . "
10965	10972	10955	10955	he	32	" Is it hot in here ? "
10973	10987	10988	10988	She	31	" Feels kind of warm . I 'll turn the air conditioning up . "
11014	11017	11018	11018	he	32	" Sorry , "
11031	11045	11046	11046	he	32	" But I 'm just a man and that dress on you is , "
11051	11054	11046	11046	he	32	" torture . "
11069	11076	11077	11077	she	31	" Maybe I should get changed , "
11080	11083	11077	11077	she	31	" No ! "
11096	11111	11092	11092	he	32	" Yeah , okay , I think you better . I need to concentrate . "
11129	11143	11119	11119	his	32	" But it goes against every male hormone I possess to let you . "
11454	11457	11458	11458	Sam	32	" Maddie ? "
11464	11478	11458	11458	Sam	32	" I 've changed my mind . You can keep the dress on . "
11487	11495	11496	11496	He	32	" Too late . It 's off . "
11654	11671	11636	11636	He	32	" You 're a fan of Eastwood ? I did n't think chicks liked his films . "
11672	11680	11681	11681	His	32	" I 'm not your average chick . "
11711	11715	11716	11716	His	32	" No kidding . "
12216	12222	12223	12223	she	31	" Why are you staring ? "
12229	12242	12243	12243	She	31	" Um , I was just wondering how to ask you something . "
12262	12268	12257	12257	she	31	" Do n't , Sam . "
12281	12299	12300	12300	She	31	" Actually , I was going to ask you to help me find a place to live . "
12350	12360	12361	12361	he	32	" I need to move out of Mum 's , "
12364	12371	12361	12361	he	32	" I 'm cramping her style . "
12372	12379	12380	12380	He	32	" Not the other way round ? "
12413	12436	12405	12405	He	32	" Not this time . Believe me , Mum 's changed since Dad died . She 's discovered life . And men . "
12437	12449	12387	12387	She	31	" So why ca n't she help you find a place ? "
12450	12462	12463	12463	He	32	" She will . That 's what I 'm worried about . "
12471	12489	12490	12490	he	32	" I like your style . You 've got great taste , Maddie . I just thought , "
12493	12516	12490	12490	he	32	" that I could borrow some of that style . Maybe once I get a place you can help me furnish it . "
12517	12525	12562	12562	She	376	" Do n't you already have furniture ? "
12526	12541	12490	12490	he	32	" Yeah , but it wo n’t be right . Not ... comfortable enough . "
12708	12712	12705	12705	Maddie	31	" Something funny ? "
12716	12725	12713	12713	Sam	32	" No ! No , not at all . "
12754	12769	12770	12770	He	32	" I was just thinking you and Mum have a few things in common . "
12777	12780	12770	12770	He	32	" Scary . "
12781	12788	12789	12789	She	31	" You can say that again . "
12802	12835	12789	12789	She	31	" That 's not something you want to hear from a man . Especially from one whose mother used to call my mother and complain that Linda was leading her son astray . "
12855	12870	12789	12789	She	31	" She did that ? She was more out of control than I thought . "
12871	12895	12836	12836	He	32	" I 'm sure she 's mellowed in recent years . She has n't had anyone to worry about since you left town . "
12896	12902	12903	12903	he	32	" Now I 'm back , "
12953	12961	12962	12962	he	32	" I 'm insane are n't I ? "
12977	13010	12974	12974	She	266	" How is the old ba — , ah , dear , anyway ? Still ruling the tennis club with an iron fist and frightening the teachers down at the high school ? "
13011	13072	13073	13073	She	266	" She was a menace , was n't she ? Remember that time I failed art and she told Mr. Gower he was a decrepit old hippie who would n't know creativity if it jumped up and bit his very large nose . I thought he was going to have a heart attack right there in the Principal 's office . "
13124	13131	13132	13132	she	266	" How could you fail art ? "
13135	13145	13132	13132	she	266	" I thought old Flower Power Gower passed everyone . "
13149	13176	13146	13146	He	388	" Instead of drawing a fruit bowl I drew Mrs. McClary , the English teacher , without clothes on . At Pete 's encouragement of course . "
13180	13189	13177	13177	She	266	" You two were impossible in those days . "
13205	13215	13216	13216	he	388	" Pete seems to have turned out all right , "
13219	13223	13216	13216	he	388	" And you ? "
13224	13238	13239	13239	She	266	" Me ? Only the love of a good woman can save me . "
13418	13421	13422	13422	he	32	" Maddie , "
13459	13462	13463	13463	He	32	" Yeow ! "
13536	13557	13558	13558	She	31	" Oh my God ! Are you all right ? Sam , are you hurt ? I 'm so sorry . "
13649	13655	13656	13656	His	32	" Take your pants off . "
13661	13664	13665	13665	She	31	" Huh ? "
13675	13684	13665	13665	She	31	" So I can put this on your ... "
13696	13702	13693	13693	her	31	" Does n't it hurt ? "
13715	13724	13725	13725	She	31	" It 's a little warm down there . "
13731	13742	13725	13725	She	31	" Then we have to get this towel on quick . "
13820	13845	13815	13815	her	31	" Oh , Sam , I 'm so sorry . Are you sure you 're okay ? Maybe you want to go the bathroom . "
13909	13915	13894	13894	She	31	" You 're all red . "
13920	13956	13902	13902	her	31	" I feel absolutely terrible . I never spill things . It 's just that I was n't expecting you to be so close and your voice made me jump and the coffee went everywhere — "
14085	14091	14092	14092	she	31	" Your ass is mine , "
14664	14672	14673	14673	she	31	" Um , maybe we should n't , "
14679	14684	14676	14676	He	32	" Maybe we should . "
14710	14720	14706	14706	She	31	" But we 're not even seeing each other . "
14733	14747	14728	14728	he	32	" I see you , you see me , let 's have sex . "
14748	14758	14759	14759	She	31	" But I 'm not wearing the appropriate underwear ! "
14770	14786	14787	14787	He	32	" I do n’t care . You wo n't be wearing any in a minute . "
14835	14842	14843	14843	His	32	" You 're amazing , Maddie . "
14864	14873	14874	14874	He	32	" I ca n't get enough of you . "
15056	15064	15052	15052	He	32	" No . I wo n't last . "
15077	15086	15074	15074	his	32	" But hold that thought for next time . "
15137	15149	15150	15150	His	32	" I thought you said you were n't wearing appropriate underwear . "
15157	15168	15169	15169	He	32	" Here 's a tip . Thongs are always appropriate . "
15279	15287	15288	15288	he	32	" As much as I love these , "
15297	15304	15288	15288	he	32	" they ’ve got to go . "
15321	15324	15325	15325	he	32	" Better , "
15470	15477	15466	15466	she	31	" Mmm , that felt good . "
15478	15485	15456	15456	his	32	" Then why did you move ? "
15486	15489	15490	15490	She	31	" I ... "
15621	15625	15626	15626	she	31	" Enter me , "
15640	15648	15632	15632	He	32	" But do n't you want to — "
15649	15657	15632	15632	He	32	" I want you to enter me . "
15697	15700	15701	15701	he	32	" No , "
15709	15716	15704	15704	She	31	" What do you mean no ? "
15717	15722	15724	15724	he	32	" I mean no . "
15737	15761	15724	15724	he	32	" I do n’t know about the other guys you ’ve had , but I like to give a woman some pleasure first . "
15762	15767	15704	15704	She	31	" It 's okay . "
15768	15782	15724	15724	he	32	" No , it 's not . I want you to enjoy this . "
15783	15787	15788	15788	She	31	" I will . "
15815	15820	15808	15808	He	32	" That 's cheating . "
15821	15826	15827	15827	She	31	" I never cheat . "
15855	15858	15859	15859	he	32	" Okay , "
15862	15878	15859	15859	he	32	" I 'm not Superman . Next time I 'm going to blow your mind . "
15955	15959	15960	15960	he	32	" Oh Maddie , "
16003	16006	16007	16007	He	32	" Wait ! "
16021	16024	16025	16025	he	32	" What ? "
16028	16031	16025	16025	he	32	" Condom . "
16051	16070	16032	16032	He	32	" Jeez , you scared the hell out of me . I thought you 'd changed your mind . "
16111	16127	16097	16097	She	31	" I know they 're in here somewhere . I always keep one for emergencies . "
16128	16134	16135	16135	He	32	" This is an emergency . "
16142	16157	16135	16135	He	32	" In fact , it 's a matter of life and death for my — "
16158	16162	16163	16163	She	31	" Got it . "
16171	16184	16185	16185	She	31	" It 's not a prize . Hurry up and open it . "
16204	16208	16209	16209	he	32	" Oh wow , "
16212	16220	16209	16209	he	32	" you 've got wonderfully sensuous hands . "
16247	16253	16254	16254	he	32	" You ’re so tight , "
16447	16450	16451	16451	he	32	" Maddie , "
16457	16462	16451	16451	he	32	" that was fantastic . "
16669	16673	16674	16674	he	32	" Next time , "
16682	16699	16674	16674	he	32	" it ’ll be better for you . I wo n’t let you distract me again . "
16903	16911	16912	16912	he	32	" You never gave me an answer , "
16935	16939	16925	16925	her	31	" About what ? "
16940	16951	16952	16952	He	32	" About helping me look for a place to live . "
17002	17013	16997	16997	her	31	" I do n't think that 's a good idea . "
17014	17054	17055	17055	He	32	" Why not ? If my mother helps me , she 'll insist on something around the corner from her , and I do n't think I 'm ready for that so soon after my arrival back in Melbourne . "
17187	17191	17192	17192	he	32	" Come here , "
17213	17220	17205	17205	she	31	" I think you should go . "
17233	17238	17239	17239	He	32	" What ? Why ? "
17248	17258	17239	17239	He	32	" I thought you enjoyed that . I did . "
17259	17264	17265	17265	She	31	" Yes , but ... "
17268	17286	17265	17265	She	31	" You have to go . I , ah , have to look after the kids tonight . "
17290	17300	17287	17287	He	32	" Pete did n't mention they were going out . "
17301	17313	17314	17314	She	31	" Pete does n't have to tell you everything any more . "
17325	17347	17319	17319	He	32	" I know . Well , how about I come round , keep you company after the kids go to sleep . "
17348	17351	17352	17352	She	31	" No ! "
17360	17376	17352	17352	She	31	" Pete and Linda are really funny about other people having sex in their house . "
17377	17387	17388	17388	he	32	" I do n't blame them ! And Maddie , "
17395	17422	17388	17388	he	32	" I was offering to watch TV with you , have a chat or play poker , not make love to you on their kitchen table . "
17428	17446	17423	17423	She	31	" Oh . Right . Well , I still do n't think it 's a good idea . "
17525	17528	17529	17529	he	32	" Why ? "
17532	17543	17529	17529	he	32	" Sam , this is n't going to work out . "
17607	17620	17599	17599	He	32	" Are you mad because I did n't give you an orgasm ? "
17621	17624	17599	17599	He	32	" No ! "
17625	17641	17599	17599	He	32	" Oh . Okay . But I will , if you give me another chance . "
17642	17650	17599	17599	He	32	" No , Sam , no more . "
17755	17769	17770	17770	he	32	" I thought what we just did meant everything was okay between us , "
17780	17801	17770	17770	he	32	" I suppose it could be read that way , but I 'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression . "
17802	17805	17806	17806	He	32	" Yeah . "
17809	17822	17806	17806	He	32	" My fault for thinking making love actually meant you liked me . "
17838	17842	17823	17823	He	32	" Stupid me . "
17843	17854	17858	17858	her	422	" Sam , I 'm sorry , I really am . "
17929	17936	17937	17937	Her	422	" Maddie , what 's wrong ? "
17968	17975	17954	17954	she	422	" We 're chalk and cheese . "
17976	17984	17956	17956	her	422	" So ? I do n't care . "
17985	17989	17990	17990	She	422	" You will . "
18016	18026	18001	18001	She	422	" I have to go , Sam , so ... "
18027	18033	18034	18034	He	32	" I get the message . "
18449	18455	18440	18440	Miles	52	" How 'd it go ? "
18487	18494	18495	18495	He	52	" Good morning to you too . "
18504	18509	18510	18510	He	52	" Yada yada yada . "
18527	18530	18531	18531	She	31	" Well ? "
18534	18546	18531	18531	She	31	" Good , I guess . I got a few dates . "
18547	18567	18568	18568	She	31	" Really ? How many ? With more than one man ? How far did he want to go ? "
18573	18580	18581	18581	She	31	" You sound like my sister . "
18603	18608	18609	18609	Beaker	69	" That 's fantastic ! "
18618	18624	18609	18609	Beaker	69	" You told him huh ? "
18625	18630	18631	18631	Miles	52	" She sure did ! "
18646	18665	18635	18635	Beaker	69	" And if you 'd stuck around on Friday night we could have tested the response of females . "
18666	18669	18670	18670	Beaker	69	" Sorry , "
18704	18712	18714	18714	Maddie	31	" It was after five - thirty , "
18725	18747	18748	18748	He	69	" And he had a date , did n't you , Beaker . How 'd it go , by the way ? "
18753	18761	18748	18748	He	69	" Okay , I guess , but — "
18762	18768	18770	18770	Miles	52	" Forget about your date , "
18775	18803	18770	18770	Miles	52	" I want you to use Pheramour for the next few days . Maddie 's results will have to do until you can give me a report . "
18816	18825	18826	18826	He	69	" I think Fleur Elise will be happy . "
18839	18852	18853	18853	He	69	" I 'll come by tomorrow morning to see how you went . "
18859	18869	18856	18856	Beaker	69	" I had a feeling he 'd say that . "
18888	18897	18870	18870	He	69	" Annie 's not going to like this . "
18898	18902	18856	18856	Beaker	69	" Your girlfriend ? "
18903	18911	18912	18912	Maddie	31	" Sort of . She gets jealous . "
18920	18924	18912	18912	Maddie	31	" Of whom ? "
18925	18940	18942	18942	they	444	" Other women . She says they look at me like they want me . "
18988	19017	19018	19018	he	69	" If Pheramour works as well on me as it did on you , it 's going to be real hard to convince her I 'm not cheating , "
19021	19035	19018	19018	he	69	" I 'm sure she 'll understand when you explain it to her . "
19044	19076	19036	19036	He	69	" It 's done amazing things for you , Maddie . You look great . I ca n't put my finger on what it is , but you definitely seem different . "
19121	19132	19133	19133	he	69	" So what did he say when you told him ? "
19136	19142	19133	19133	he	69	" Told who , what ? "
19143	19148	19149	19149	Beaker	69	" This Sam guy . "
19154	19166	19149	19149	Beaker	69	" You did tell him about Pheramour , did n't you ? "
19167	19173	19174	19174	She	31	" Uh , not yet . "
19181	19188	19174	19174	She	31	" But I 'm going to . "
19223	19237	19201	19201	She	31	" Good . You do n't want to give him the wrong idea . "
19238	19242	19243	19243	she	31	" Why not ? "
19279	19294	19271	19271	She	31	" Because it 's wrong . The poor guy thinks he 's in love . "
19317	19325	19326	19326	she	31	" Is n't that the whole point ? "
19339	19359	19326	19326	she	31	" Are n't Fleur Elise marketing Pheramour as a love drug that no one need know you 're wearing ? "
19367	19381	19360	19360	He	32	" Oh , yeah , I guess . It seems kind of wrong though "
19382	19385	19386	19386	she	31	" Yeah , "
19440	19448	19449	19449	she	31	" I need to speak to Miles , "
19480	19499	19500	19500	He	69	" That was Hillary Westgath - Smith from Fleur Elise . She 's very excited about the progress . "
19506	19523	19500	19500	He	69	" She 's coming here tomorrow so you and Beaker can give her a progress report . "
19524	19529	19582	19582	his	69	" That 's great . "
19534	19546	19582	19582	his	69	" Look , Miles , I want to ask you something . "
19547	19551	19582	19582	his	69	" Ask away . "
19552	19562	19582	19582	his	69	" Have you thought through the consequences of Pheramour ? "
19563	19578	19579	19579	He	69	" Of course . You 'll all get a bonus , do n't worry . "
19585	19600	19579	19579	He	69	" There just might be a promotion in it for you too , Maddie . "
19800	19805	19807	19807	Sam	32	" that nice Maddie Clarke "
19919	19930	19931	19932	his mother	266	" So , why wo n't you date my Sammy ? "
19957	19960	19961	19961	he	32	" Mum , "
19976	19990	19991	19991	she	266	" You do know that lots of other girls want to date him , "
19994	20005	19991	19991	she	266	" Just this morning I hung up on Bec Davies . "
20034	20039	20040	20040	she	266	" I remember Bec , "
20043	20049	20040	20040	she	266	" I never liked her , "
20055	20065	20066	20066	She	266	" She 's not a nice girl like you . "
20079	20120	20075	20075	Maddie	31	" Thanks . But you should n’t have hung up on Bec . She ’d be quite a catch from what I hear , and I believe she ’s looking for another husband . Maybe you could call her back . "
20160	20169	20170	20171	his mother	266	" No , I do n’t think so , "
20174	20212	20170	20171	his mother	266	" Anyway , I ca n't hang up on these girls forever . He 's very popular , you know . So why did you dump him ? Is it because he has n't got a job ? "
20216	20223	20224	20224	Maddie	31	" No , nothing like that , "
20230	20240	20241	20241	He	32	" Maybe she thinks my mother 's too controlling . "
20253	20262	20241	20241	He	32	" shut up before you ruin this for me "
20269	20284	20285	20285	she	266	" Or is it because he 's too popular . I can understand that , "
20289	20303	20285	20285	she	266	" I 'm dating a man who has several other women chasing him . "
20327	20330	20332	20332	Maddie	31	" Oh ? "
20343	20349	20332	20332	Maddie	31	" You 're dating someone ? "
20354	20365	20332	20332	Maddie	31	" Yes . Perhaps you know him . Kevin Bowcher ? "
20375	20378	20379	20379	She	31	" Really ? "
20396	20404	20388	20388	her	31	" Did n't you date his daughters ? "
20424	20431	20432	20432	he	32	" Not at the same time , "
20520	20529	20530	20530	Maddie	31	" Your mother seems to be enjoying life , "
20537	20546	20530	20530	Maddie	31	" Yes , but not always her own . "
20558	20571	20547	20547	She	266	" Look , Sam , there 's something I need to say . "
20572	20575	20530	20530	Maddie	31	" Right . "
20589	20592	20585	20585	Maddie	31	" bad news "
20598	20609	20610	20610	She	266	" Do you want a drink before we get started ? "
20615	20618	20612	20612	her	266	" Scone ? "
20619	20622	20585	20585	Maddie	31	" No . "
20623	20631	20632	20632	He	1369	" Is it too warm in here ? "
20635	20644	20632	20632	He	1369	" Should I turn up the air conditioning ? "
20645	20652	20653	20653	He	1369	" No . And quit stalling . "
20666	20681	20655	20655	his	1369	" It 's not that bad anyway , depending on your point of view . "
20744	20762	20725	20725	she	266	" Do you remember the other day , when I told you what I was working on ? "
20763	20778	20779	20779	He	1369	" A love potion . What 's that got to do with ... Oh . "
20811	20814	20815	20815	Maddie	31	" Yeah , "
20819	20829	20830	20830	she	31	" So you see , this whole thing is , "
20838	20864	20830	20830	she	31	" not real . I bathed in Pheramour before I saw you and ever since then , you 've been , um , very attentive . "
20908	20916	20897	20897	He	1369	" So none of this is real ? "
20917	20922	20926	20926	her	31	" No . Sorry . "
21041	21044	21036	21036	he	1369	" Why ? "
21062	21068	21059	21059	She	31	" Because you were there . "
21077	21091	21073	21073	He	1369	" Glad to know I made it all nice and convenient for you . "
21095	21106	21092	21092	Maddie	31	" Sam , please , it was n't like that . "
21135	21143	21144	21144	he	1369	" I thought we had something special , "
21185	21191	21192	21192	he	1369	" I thought this feeling , "
21202	21206	21192	21192	he	1369	" was real . "
21212	21215	21216	21216	he	1369	" Maybe , "
21225	21232	21233	21233	He	1369	" maybe it 's not working . "
21284	21293	21270	21270	he	1369	" Maddie , are you wearing it now ? "
21294	21307	21340	21340	He	1369	" No , but there 's still some lodged in my epidermis . "
21318	21330	21308	21308	He	1369	" Maybe it 's not working . Maybe this is real . "
21358	21379	21349	21349	She	31	" It 's working . You must have noticed all the men looking at me at the market on Saturday . "
21380	21392	21340	21340	He	1369	" Maybe they were looking because you 're a beautiful woman . "
21393	21439	21440	21440	She	31	" They never used to look . Trust me , I 've been in this body for thirty years , and I 've never had as much attention as I had on Saturday . Pheramour makes people of the opposite sex attracted to the wearer . "
21446	21467	21440	21440	She	31	" That 's why you still think I look beautiful . It 'll wear off after a few more showers . "
21533	21540	21541	21541	He	1369	" Sam ? Are you okay ? "
21548	21570	21541	21541	He	1369	" Just great . My whole life has been turned upside down , so yeah , I feel wonderful . You ? "
21571	21576	21618	21618	His	1369	" I 'm sorry — "
21577	21582	21541	21541	He	1369	" So you said . "
21583	21606	21541	21541	He	1369	" I really am . I did n't think you 'd take it this hard . I thought you 'd be happy . "
21607	21617	21618	21618	His	1369	" I am happy , ca n't you tell ? "
21649	21658	21631	21631	He	1369	" You must really hate me , Maddie . "
21659	21668	21541	21541	He	1369	" No ! I do n’t . Sam — "
21669	21710	21631	21631	He	1369	" Yes , you do . Only someone who hates could make another person willingly feel this way . What did I ever do to deserve your hatred ? Why the hell would you want to hurt me like this ? "
21829	21840	21807	21808	the women	492	" I do n't hate you , Sam , I — "
21841	21878	21879	21879	Her	494	" Then why are you doing this to me ? What have I ever done to you ? I was always nice to you , even when we were kids and Pete used to tease you . "
21904	21909	21910	21910	She	494	" Nice to me ! "
21919	21932	21910	21910	She	494	" Your memory is very selective , Sam Hennessy . Typical man . "
21954	21963	21975	21975	Her	494	" Maddie , what are you talking about ? "
21964	21971	21972	21972	She	494	" You really do n't remember ? "
22039	22051	22033	22033	He	1369	" No , but I 'm sure you 'll tell me . "
22052	22061	22033	22033	He	1369	" You called me a nerd , Sam . "
22064	22068	22069	22069	Sam	32	" A nerd ? "
22076	22079	22069	22069	Sam	32	" When ? "
22080	22087	22088	22088	Maddie	31	" I was in ninth grade . "
22093	22106	22090	22090	her	31	" I was trying to help you and you shot me down . "
22138	22144	22134	22134	she	31	" Help me ? Maddie . "
22164	22175	22150	22150	she	31	" I do n't remember saying anything mean to you . "
22176	22201	22202	22202	She	31	" That 's because I was beneath your notice most of the time . Except when you deigned to remind me of my status . "
22223	22230	22232	22232	she	31	" Wait , do n't go . "
22247	22252	22253	22253	He	1369	" Maddie , wait . "
22268	22296	22258	22258	she	31	" Are you saying you did this to me , used this Pheramour stuff on me , as revenge for calling you a nerd in high school ? "
22351	22366	22367	22367	He	1369	" No , of course not . You were convenient , that 's all . "
22376	22382	22369	22369	his	1369	" Convenient . How fortunate . "
22483	22486	22487	22487	she	501	" Look , "
22494	22520	22487	22487	she	501	" let 's go through this logically . When I brought up the nerd thing , I was just trying to get a point across . "
22597	22604	22605	22605	he	32	" And your point would be ? "
22608	22614	22615	22615	she	501	" Oh , come on , "
22630	22666	22615	22615	she	501	" you do n't think the nerd and the cool guy can have a real relationship do you ? Not without something to push it along , a catalyst to make you attracted to me . "
22686	22698	22667	22667	She	501	" So that made you the perfect man for the experiment . "
22699	22713	22719	22719	his	32	" Gee , thanks . I 'm so glad you found me useful . "
22758	22764	22765	22765	she	501	" I really am sorry , "
22769	22796	22765	22765	she	501	" But you 'll get over it soon enough and forget all about me and this weekend . You ’ll go back to your normal life . "
22912	22915	22916	22916	he	32	" Good , "
22919	22931	22916	22916	he	32	" Because my old life was much easier than this one . "
22940	22948	22932	22932	He	32	" You know , you were right . "
22949	22953	22954	22954	she	501	" About what ? "
22961	22974	22954	22954	she	501	" Women like you and guys like me should n't be together . "
22980	22988	22977	22977	his	32	" What the hell was I thinking ? "
23039	23044	23045	23045	He	32	" I better go . "
23093	23113	23114	23114	he	32	" I guess I 'm not going to know if this is real or not for a while yet , "
23121	23130	23117	23117	his	32	" but you 're not affected by Pheramour . "
23159	23174	23117	23117	his	32	" Tell me you feel nothing for me and I 'll forget about you . "
23215	23224	23225	23225	She	31	" I do n't love you , Sam . "
23855	23861	23842	23842	Beaker	69	" Are n't they cute ? "
23862	23868	23870	23870	Maddie	31	" Yeah , real cute , "
23872	23881	23870	23870	Maddie	31	" I wish they 'd kill each other . "
23890	23900	23882	23882	Beaker	69	" So Sam did n't take the news well ? "
23901	23909	23842	23842	Beaker	69	" As well as can be expected . "
23910	23916	23870	23870	Maddie	31	" That bad , huh ? "
23917	23948	23949	23949	He	69	" Worse . I 'll have to go see him again once Pheramour has completely worn off just to prove to him that what he 's feeling is n't real . "
24052	24062	24063	24063	she	31	" Do n't distract her with the back scratch , "
24066	24076	24063	24063	she	31	" she 's supposed to be focusing on Fred . "
24082	24093	24094	24094	she	31	" So how 'd it go with you last night ? "
24102	24113	24094	24094	she	31	" Great . Annie could n't get enough of me . "
24123	24146	24117	24117	She	31	" Too much information . And you were supposed to try it on women who are n't already in love with you . "
24154	24174	24117	24117	She	31	" I know . But I really hate clubs and I was n't sure where else to meet women . "
24175	24186	24187	24187	He	69	" And Annie just happened to come around , right ? "
24190	24210	24187	24187	He	69	" Do n't tell Miles . I sort of skipped over the particulars when I gave him my report . "
24221	24233	24211	24211	Maddie	31	" This has been the worst experiment I ’ve ever conducted . "
24242	24261	24234	24234	Beaker	69	" Okay , okay , I 'll go to a couple of clubs tonight . Jeez , Maddie . "
24267	24304	24264	24264	her	31	" No , it ’s more than that . It ’s Pheramour . You were right . Everyone was right , even my sister and that ’s not something you ’ll ever hear me say again . "
24310	24317	24305	24305	Beaker	69	" What are you talking about ? "
24318	24335	24336	24336	Beaker	69	" Pheramour could mean the end of social interaction as we know it . Sexual chaos . "
24342	24347	24336	24336	Beaker	69	" Sounds ... intesting . "
24348	24370	24371	24371	His	69	" Messy more like . Imagine everyone running around thinking they 're in love with everyone else . What a nightmare ! "
24376	24381	24371	24371	His	69	" Yeah . Nightmare . "
24460	24479	24481	24481	Miles	52	" Maddie and Beaker are the biochemists on the Pheramour project . They 're also our pilot users , "
24498	24504	24505	24505	Maddie	31	" Tell Hillary your results . "
24512	24518	24520	24520	Hillary	71	" That 's very encouraging , "
24551	24554	24555	24555	she	31	" Hillary , "
24558	24569	24555	24555	she	31	" has your company thought about the ramifications of Pheramour ? "
24570	24590	24616	24616	Miles	52	" We expect a ten percent profit in the first quarter , but after an intense marketing push into — "
24591	24613	24555	24555	she	31	" I mean the social ramifications . You know , everyone falling in love and having sexual relations with everyone else . "
24623	24628	24616	24616	Miles	52	" Uh , well — "
24629	24640	24642	24642	Miles	52	" I think you and I should discuss this later , "
24664	24672	24673	24673	he	52	" Come by my office at five , "
24679	24687	24688	24688	Maddie	31	" I think I 'm in trouble , "
24695	24698	24700	24700	Beaker	69	" Deep , "
24705	24722	24700	24700	Beaker	69	" Miles does n't like dissent amongst the troops , especially in front of the clients . "
24765	24774	24762	24762	he	52	" Do n't bother . You 're fired . "
24777	24783	24784	24784	Maddie	31	" I 'm a loser , "
24798	24805	24807	24807	Linda	60	" You 're not a loser , "
24824	24831	24807	24807	Linda	60	" You 're just occupationally challenged . "
24832	24838	24793	24793	Linda	60	" You 're not helping . "
24839	24845	24846	24846	Linda	60	" Of course I am . "
24869	24878	24846	24846	Linda	60	" I ’m offering chocolate are n’t I ? "
24889	24904	24846	24846	Linda	60	" If you were helping , you 'd have given me twice as much . "
24905	24913	24914	24914	Linda	60	" Sorry . What was I thinking ? "
24933	24944	24945	24945	Maddie	31	" You were thinking your sister is such a loser , "
24955	24978	24945	24945	Maddie	31	" I was not . I was wondering how you were going to get your hands on the formula for Pheramour now . "
24979	25003	25004	25004	She	60	" Linda ! Pheramour 's the reason I 'm unemployed . This is such a mess . I 'm such a screw up . "
25025	25033	25034	25034	Linda	60	" You 're not a screw up . "
25056	25076	25043	25043	Ronan	37	" You 'll get through this , Mad . Look at Sam . He changes jobs all the time . "
25077	25101	25040	25040	her	60	" He does n't get fired from them ! And do n't talk to me about Sam . This is all his fault . "
25102	25110	25145	25145	Linda	60	" I thought it was Pheramour 's . "
25111	25123	25043	25043	Ronan	37	" Sam 's the one who first suggested Pheramour was unethical . "
25124	25136	25137	25137	Maddie	31	" Then I guess it 's just as much my fault . "
25148	25160	25145	25145	Linda	60	" Speaking of Sam , what did you do to him ? "
25161	25167	25043	25043	Ronan	37	" Nothing ! I swear ! "
25168	25184	25145	25145	Linda	60	" Then why did he take off to Sydney on the spur of the moment ? "
25194	25205	25190	25190	He	552	" Oh God , I drove him out of town . "
25206	25234	25043	25043	Ronan	37	" You did n't drive him out . He 's only gone for a few days to finalize everything there . Pete said something about a dog . "
25235	25238	25190	25190	He	552	" Chewy . "
25247	25260	25261	25261	Linda	60	" Do you have any more ? Alcohol would be good too . "
25264	25312	25313	25313	She	60	" We 've only got beer , but I 've got a stash of chocolate liqueurs . I have to hide them from Pete in the cupboard with the baking trays . He 'll never look there unless for some miracle he gets the urge to bake . "
25357	25364	25327	25327	She	60	" Mmmm . I love these . "
25365	25383	25313	25313	She	60	" Me too . Hand them over . Tell me more about what you did to Sam . "
25384	25391	25313	25313	She	60	" I told him about Pheramour . "
25392	25403	25327	25327	She	60	" You did what ? Maddie , are you insane ? "
25404	25417	25313	25313	She	60	" Very possibly . Miles definitely thinks I 've lost the plot . "
25418	25429	25430	25430	Linda	60	" I do n't care what that little jerk thinks . "
25436	25449	25430	25430	Linda	60	" Why did you tell Sam ? Everything was going so well . "
25450	25480	25313	25313	She	60	" I had to . I could n't use Pheramour forever . I did n't want to . I suppose I wanted what we had to be ... real . "
25481	25494	25430	25430	Linda	60	" But did you have to bring up the nerd thing too ? "
25502	25507	25495	25495	Maddie	31	" He told you ? "
25508	25556	25313	25313	She	60	" He told Pete . Sam asked Pete if he could remember ever calling you a nerd . Pete said he used to say it all the time but neither of them could remember Sam calling you that . Are you sure you did n't imagine it ? "
25557	25566	25495	25495	Maddie	31	" Years of teenage angst do not lie . "
25588	25593	25577	25577	she	31	" I feel sick . "
25594	25600	25313	25313	She	60	" You 'll be fine . "
25601	25632	25577	25577	she	31	" How will I be fine ? I 'm unemployed and my love life sucks . The last guy I went out with only dated me because I drugged him . "
25633	25642	25643	25643	Linda	60	" You did not drug him , you , "
25650	25654	25643	25643	Linda	60	" coerced him . "
25655	25660	25577	25577	she	31	" I tricked him . "
25668	25680	25661	25661	Maddie	31	" I 'm a nerd , a bitch and a loser . "
25696	25711	25681	25681	Linda	60	" You 'll be fine . You 've got some savings in the bank . "
26053	26056	26051	26051	Sam	32	" Hello ? "
26057	26064	26051	26051	Sam	32	" Maddie ? It 's Beaker . "
26065	26068	26051	26051	Sam	32	" Oh . "
26069	26092	26051	26051	Sam	32	" Miles told me what happened after you left . Why did n't you come back to the lab and say goodbye ? "
26108	26113	26098	26098	everyone	247	" I hate goodbyes . "
26118	26124	26125	26125	Beaker	69	" Yeah , me too . "
26153	26156	26157	26157	he	69	" Hey , "
26161	26169	26157	26157	he	69	" there 's something you should know . "
26170	26180	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" Miles has contracted a rare penis shrinking disease ? "
26184	26212	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" You 're not bitter or anything are you ? No , Miles is okay , for someone who might be out of a job soon too . "
26213	26219	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" Miles is getting fired ? "
26220	26249	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" Maybe . Pheramour 's not working on Fred and Wilma anymore . They ca n't stand each other . I 'm beginning to think it never worked . "
26250	26259	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" It does ! I 'm living proof . "
26260	26286	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" Are you sure ? When I used it , only Annie responded . None of the women at the lab found me more attractive . "
26296	26313	26290	26290	Maddie	31	" And you 've only got that Sam person . One response is not conclusive proof . "
26314	26330	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" There were others at the market . Honest . Men kept looking at me . "
26331	26376	26377	26377	He	571	" Were you wearing something different ? Maybe you had your hair down . You do look , well , um , hot when it tumbles over your shoulders . And you 've got a great body , so if you wore something tight ... "
26383	26392	26377	26377	He	571	" I think I better shut up now . "
26396	26403	26393	26393	She	31	" You 're delusional , Beaker . "
26404	26417	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" Am I ? What about Sam ? Maybe he 's smitten . "
26418	26437	26181	26181	Beaker	69	" Sam Hennessy has never been smitten with anything in his life . Except maybe with his car . "
26438	26502	26503	26503	He	572	" I got ta go , Maddie , but think about it . Pheramour is definitely not working and now that Hillary What's - Her - Name knows it , she 's going to be advising her company to pull out of the deal . Miles made us all stay back late to save his bacon but I do n't think we can . "
26509	26515	26503	26503	He	572	" We 're all screwed . "
26618	26624	26611	26611	Pheramour	48	" Sam actually likes me . "
26692	26702	26689	26689	Pete	38	" What 's Sam 's phone number in Sydney ? "
26703	26716	26677	26677	She	31	" Maddie ? Is that you ? You sound different . Desperate . "
26717	26729	26689	26689	Pete	38	" I am and stop stalling . Give me his number . "
26730	26743	26744	26744	He	38	" So you want to speak to him now , do you ? "
26748	26757	26744	26744	He	38	" You 've changed your tune since yesterday . "
26769	26802	26765	26765	her	31	" Pete , I know you 're upset on Sam 's behalf , but there 's really no need . I want to talk to him . It 's all okay now . "
26823	26846	26689	26689	Pete	38	" I do n't know , Mad , he was pretty upset . He even threatened to give up dating women altogether . "
26852	26869	26689	26689	Pete	38	" Not that he 's going to start dating men of course , it 's just — "
26870	26882	26765	26765	her	31	" PETE ! Shut up and give me his Sydney number . "
26883	26939	26689	26689	Pete	38	" Hey , do n't shout . Jeez , you 're more demanding than my kids . Anyway , I do n't know his number . He sold his Sydney apartment and left Chewy with friends . I think he was staying with them for a few days till he got his head around everything . "
26940	26949	26689	26689	Pete	38	" And you do n't have their number ? "
26950	26953	26765	26765	her	31	" No . "
26954	26961	26689	26689	Pete	38	" What about his mobile phone ? "
26962	27003	27004	27004	Maddie	31	" Company phone . He had to give it back when he quit and has n’t got another one yet . Why do n’t you try Mrs. Hennessy . I 'm sure the old busybody knows how to contact him . "
27007	27015	27004	27004	Maddie	31	" But she 's so ... scary . "
27016	27047	26689	26689	Pete	38	" Yeah . I would n't call her if I were you , especially if Sam told her about Pheramour . You 're probably number one on her hit list . "
27048	27052	26689	26689	Pete	38	" Thanks anyway . "
27053	27062	27063	27063	he	577	" No problem - o. So , Mad , "
27068	27086	27063	27063	he	577	" I thought it was over between you two . Or should I say non - existent . "
27087	27093	27096	27096	him	577	" Pheramour does n't work . "
27102	27110	27096	27096	him	577	" That 's good . I guess . "
27118	27121	27111	27111	Maddie	31	" But ? "
27122	27131	27115	27115	his	577	" Well , what about the nerd thing ? "
27204	27210	27211	27211	she	31	" Thanks for reminding me , "
27519	27525	27505	27505	Chewy	79	" I know it hurts . "
27529	27539	27505	27505	Chewy	79	" Shut up , you 're driving me nuts . "
27564	27574	27577	27577	he	79	" I 'm so excited I 'm going to pee "
28049	28058	28059	28059	she	60	" Have you called Sam 's mother yet ? "
28097	28103	28084	28084	she	60	" What 's in there ? "
28120	28159	28084	28084	she	60	" Nappies , a change of clothes for Ronan , fruit bars for when those two get hungry and toys . Which reminds me , do you know anything about Palm Beach Barbie 's missing arms and legs ? "
28160	28179	28188	28188	Maddie	31	" Not a thing . And if you do n't mind me asking , why are you here ? "
28180	28187	28084	28084	she	60	" To make you feel better . "
28226	28254	28255	28255	Linda	60	" Emily ! Be careful . And sit properly on Auntie Mad 's couch , David . Sorry , Sis , I 'll clean up the mess . "
28261	28266	28267	28267	Maddie	31	" Do n't worry , "
28270	28283	28267	28267	Maddie	31	" everything else is ruined , so why not my house too . "
28303	28312	28313	28313	Linda	60	" Linda , what 's wrong with him ? "
28319	28329	28313	28313	Linda	60	" He 's tired . It 's nap time . "
28330	28347	28313	28313	Linda	60	" You brought him here at nap time ? This is not a day care center . "
28348	28351	28352	28352	Maddie	31	" Ooopth . "
28391	28400	28401	28401	Linda	60	" Emily ! David ! Get outside now ! "
28441	28446	28434	28434	Linda	60	" One , two ... "
28456	28474	28475	28475	She	31	" We better go sit on the porch and make sure they do n't kill each other . "
28521	28526	28528	28528	Linda	60	" Oh , Maddie , "
28533	28543	28528	28528	Linda	60	" What are you giving my children to drink ? "
28547	28554	28544	28544	Maddie	31	" I thought cordial was okay . "
28565	28571	28561	28561	he	609	" Cool ! Red cordial . "
28572	28581	28582	28582	Emily	36	" Cool , we d cor - wial , "
28585	28600	28602	28602	Linda	60	" They 'll be bouncing off the walls for the rest of the day , "
28604	28615	28602	28602	Linda	60	" Maybe I 'll just leave them here all night . "
28616	28619	28620	28620	Maddie	31	" Oh . "
28725	28732	28734	28734	Linda	60	" Ah , peace and quiet , "
28814	28819	28820	28820	she	31	" I 'm exhausted , "
28823	28833	28820	28820	she	31	" I do n't know how you do it . "
28834	28858	28820	28820	she	31	" I 've learned to pitch my voice at just the right level to induce fear . It saves a lot of trouble . "
28859	28867	28820	28820	she	31	" How 's the baby ? Kicking ? "
28868	28896	28820	28820	she	31	" Not yet . Do n't worry , I 'll keep you informed of everything as soon as it happens . You wo n't miss a thing . "
28959	28971	28948	28948	She	60	" You 're still thinking about him , are n't you ? "
28979	28989	28948	28948	She	60	" Yeah . I really screwed up , Linda . "
28990	29020	29024	29024	her	31	" Not yet . Give him a chance to calm down . Talk to him when he gets back to Melbourne . It 'll be okay , I promise . "
29061	29070	29055	29055	Linda	60	" What if he does n't come back ? "
29091	29106	29055	29055	Linda	60	" He has a habit of leaving when things do n't go his way . "
29107	29133	29168	29168	her	60	" No , he has a habit of leaving when he wants a change . And I do n't think he wants things to change . "
29134	29138	29139	29139	Maddie	31	" Not yet . "
29142	29165	29139	29139	Maddie	31	" But if he does n't come back I 'll know he finds me boring and is n't interested in the nerd . "
29184	29226	29168	29168	her	60	" You 're not boring , Maddie . And stop with this nerd stuff . So what if he said it when he was seventeen . That was a hell of a long time ago . You 've changed since then . "
29227	29258	29285	29285	her	60	" Yeah right , I 've got a great career and men fall over themselves to date me . No wait , I must have read that in Who magazine . "
29259	29273	29274	29274	She	60	" Maddie , stop beating yourself up over this . You have changed . "
29288	29334	29335	29335	She	60	" Look , this is going to kill me , because I 'm your sister and , well , it 's my job to tease you , but you 've turned into a gorgeous , sweet , fun woman who 's great to be with . "
29349	29360	29285	29285	her	60	" So where are the men beating down my door ? "
29361	29425	29285	29285	her	60	" They 're not beating down your door because they do n’t know where it is . You do n't go out and meet anyone . You only know men from work and the occasional guy Pete 's set you up with . And you intimidate most of them . You 're smart , they 're not and you let them know it . "
29426	29431	29285	29285	her	60	" All of them ? "
29432	29449	29285	29285	her	60	" Well , most . Sam 's smart , just not bookish - smart like you . "
29450	29467	29285	29285	her	60	" Sam Hennessy is not intimidated by me . He teased me for crying out loud . "
29468	29475	29285	29285	her	60	" Boys tease girls they like . "
29476	29493	29494	29494	She	619	" Not a seventeen year old Sam Hennessy . He did n't tease , he fu — "
29505	29513	29498	29498	Emily	36	" Mummy , David wo n't thare . "
29514	29524	29525	29525	Linda	60	" Okay , that 's our cue to leave . "
29535	29544	29525	29525	Linda	60	" Pick up your toys and go inside . "
29564	29569	29571	29571	Linda	60	" Hey , Mad , "
29579	29591	29573	29573	she	60	" since you 're not working , can you babysit tomorrow ? "
29592	29595	29573	29573	she	60	" Tomorrow ? "
29596	29606	29608	29608	David	35	" Yeah , play with us , Auntie Mad , "
29610	29620	29608	29608	David	35	" Yeah , pway wiff uth , Auntie Mad . "
29621	29631	29632	29632	Linda	60	" Now how can you refuse such little angels ? "
29658	29674	29675	29675	she	31	" I was going to update my resume and draw up a job hunting schedule , "
29678	29689	29675	29675	she	31	" I do n't want to waste any more time . "
29690	29719	29733	29733	she	36	" Oh , Maddie , lighten up . Enjoy the day with the kids , you 'll love it . They 're not this bad all the time . "
29720	29726	29727	29727	Emily	36	" I know , but ... "
29748	29764	29733	29733	she	36	" Okay , I guess I can put off looking for work for another day . "
29765	29768	29769	29769	Linda	60	" Good , "
29772	29815	29769	29769	Linda	60	" You need a break . I ca n't remember the last holiday you had . And since you 've got some savings , why do n't you take a couple of weeks off and decide what you really want to do . "
29816	29822	29733	29733	she	36	" I need those savings . "
29823	29827	29733	29733	she	36	" What for ? "
29859	29869	29870	29870	she	60	" And I know what I want to do , "
29873	29897	29870	29870	she	60	" I want to do what I 've always done . Be a biochemist . It 's why I studied all those years . "
29909	29938	29898	29898	Linda	60	" Whatever . Just give it a few days and let the dust settle . By then Sam might be back and you two can sort things out . "
29947	29959	29965	29965	her	60	" I doubt it . He already made his stance clear . "
29992	30001	29989	29989	Maddie	31	" And I thought my life was chaotic . "
30632	30641	30625	30625	Linda	60	" How 're my babies ? Still alive ? "
30642	30647	30649	30649	Maddie	31	" I think so , "
30651	30669	30649	30649	Maddie	31	" Although my feet are killing me and I never want to see ice cream ever again . "
30670	30674	30675	30675	Linda	60	" Yeah right . "
30685	30695	30677	30677	her	60	" Were you two good for your Auntie Mad ? "
30696	30699	30701	30701	David	35	" Yes , "
30724	30729	30731	30731	Maddie	31	" How was lunch ? "
30742	30745	30731	30731	Maddie	31	" Great . "
30757	30767	30752	30752	Linda	60	" Irene says hi and she wants your help . "
30768	30774	30775	30775	Maddie	31	" My help ? Oh . "
30785	30797	30775	30775	Maddie	31	" She wants me to tutor Riley , does n't she ? "
30851	30859	30860	30860	Linda	60	" No , she wants to redecorate . "
30870	30894	30895	30895	She	60	" She asked me for advice and I said she should speak to you . You 're better at that stuff than me . "
30913	30922	30923	30923	Maddie	31	" I do n't have time for creativity . "
30926	30938	30923	30923	Maddie	31	" Look on the bright side , retro is back in . "
30939	30972	30973	30973	She	60	" This is n't retro , Mad , this is puke . I think the previous owners were trying to decorate on the cheap and orange was the discount color that week . "
30979	30987	30973	30973	She	60	" So , what do you think ? "
30988	31019	30923	30923	Maddie	31	" I do n't know . I 've never given anyone decorating advice before . If she asked me to develop non - allergenic cleaning products , I could help . "
31020	31030	30973	30973	She	60	" You 'll be great . Just do it . "
31041	31048	31038	31038	Linda	60	" At least talk to her . "
31059	31068	31069	31069	Linda	60	" I guess I can drop in tomorrow . "
31072	31111	31112	31112	Maddie	31	" I 'll call her later . This could be a whole new avenue for you , Mad . You can start a new business and you 'll be so busy you wo n't even think about Sam . "
31115	31121	31112	31112	Maddie	31	" Thanks for reminding me . "
31128	31144	31122	31122	Linda	60	" Sorry , but it 's not like you were n't thinking about him anyway . "
31173	31185	31186	31186	Linda	60	" Imagine shopping all day and spending someone else 's money , "
31190	31203	31186	31186	Linda	60	" Do n't get too excited . Irene might hate my taste . "
31671	31673	31684	31684	Pheramour	48	" hello "
31803	31806	31807	31807	She	31	" Sam ? "
31831	31837	31811	31811	her	31	" What do you want ? "
31843	31858	31811	31811	her	31	" Are you all right , Maddie ? You do n't look so good . "
31859	31868	31869	31869	She	31	" I did n't sleep well last night . "
32020	32029	32043	32043	He	32	" What are you doing here , Sam ? "
32030	32042	32043	32043	He	32	" I wanted to test something . Perform my own experiment . "
32072	32079	32068	32068	He	32	" Are you still wearing Pheramour ? "
32080	32085	32086	32086	Her	31	" Wh , what ? "
32093	32108	32086	32086	Her	31	" Pheramour ? You know , that love drug you used to trick me . "
32143	32147	32124	32124	she	31	" Are you ? "
32157	32177	32178	32178	she	31	" I 'm really sorry about that , Sam . I wish I had n't done it . But , "
32191	32204	32178	32178	she	31	" I think you should just go . This is n't helping . "
32238	32245	32224	32224	he	32	" Maddie , just tell me . "
32309	32315	32292	32292	she	31	" Maddie , answer me . "
32356	32364	32352	32352	her	31	" Sam , what are you saying ? "
32419	32431	32432	32432	He	32	" Stop this , Maddie . Stop toying with my feelings . "
32458	32469	32443	32443	she	31	" Maddie ! Why are you doing this to me ? "
32485	32489	32490	32490	she	31	" Are you , "
32497	32504	32490	32490	she	31	" are you saying you still ... "
32505	32509	32510	32510	He	32	" Want you ? "
32533	32536	32537	32537	He	32	" Yeah . "
32561	32586	32587	32587	She	31	" I want you , Maddie . I ca n't be without you . But if it 's Pheramour making me feel this way ... "
32592	32600	32589	32589	her	31	" No , it 's not working . "
32695	32700	32701	32701	she	31	" It never worked , "
32712	32736	32704	32704	She	31	" I lost my job because I took a stand , and it never worked anyway , so it does n't matter now . "
32737	32742	32743	32743	he	32	" I 'm sorry , "
32746	32755	32743	32743	he	32	" About your job . Are you okay ? "
32989	32992	32993	32993	he	32	" Maddie , "
32996	33003	32993	32993	he	32	" you know what this means ? "
33013	33018	33019	33019	she	31	" You like me , "
33022	33030	33019	33019	she	31	" but you do n't want to . "
33045	33052	33053	33053	She	31	" Why do you say that ? "
33089	33094	33095	33095	he	32	" I want you , "
33100	33106	33095	33095	he	32	" Do n't fight it . "
33152	33158	33159	33159	she	31	" We 're not compatible , "
33162	33173	33159	33159	she	31	" You said it yourself . I 'm a nerd . "
33174	33180	33185	33185	his	32	" That was years ago , "
33188	33196	33185	33185	his	32	" Ca n't you forget about it ? "
33197	33225	33159	33159	she	31	" How can I ? It 's who I am . It 's what I 've always been . You were right . I am a nerd . "
33226	33242	33159	33159	she	31	" Maddie , I do n't remember calling you that . Maybe you were mistaken — "
33243	33301	33302	33302	Her	678	" I 'm not ! It was fifteen years ago . You and Pete were over at our place and you were supposed to be studying the table of elements . None of you could remember them so Linda asked me how I did it . I used a little jingle and I sang it to you . "
33315	33329	33309	33309	She	678	" But you laughed and that 's when you called me a nerd . "
33342	33352	33330	33330	Sam	32	" Oh . Yeah . I remember that now . "
33397	33407	33408	33408	she	678	" I 'm glad you find it so funny , "
33535	33546	33547	33547	she	678	" So we 've established that I 'm a nerd , "
33558	33584	33551	33551	he	32	" Maddie , you fool . I called you a nerd all those years ago because it was the only thing I could think of . "
33585	33588	33589	33589	He	32	" Huh ? "
33603	33650	33651	33651	He	32	" You were so smart . You still are . Jeez , I could n't remember those damned chemical symbols with or without your song . I had to say something . I could n't let a little fifteen year old get the better of me . "
33654	33671	33651	33651	He	32	" It was my come - back line because you made me feel like an idiot . "
33672	33675	33676	33676	She	678	" Oh . "
33702	33714	33715	33715	she	678	" But I 'm still that same girl I was then , "
33752	33759	33760	33760	He	32	" I 'm still a nerd . "
33771	33774	33775	33775	he	32	" Fine , "
33778	33788	33775	33775	he	32	" be a nerd . I do n't care . "
33801	33808	33795	33795	him	32	" Then why did you say ... "
33811	33821	33823	33823	Sam	32	" ... women like me and guys like you ... "
33824	33831	33832	33832	He	32	" ... should n't be together ? "
33903	33915	33892	33892	his	32	" I said it because you 're too intelligent for me . "
33925	33929	33930	33930	He	32	" Too organized . "
33938	33942	33930	33930	He	32	" Too good . "
33943	33946	33960	33960	his	32	" Oh . "
33951	33956	33957	33957	he	32	" Guys like me , "
33970	33979	33957	33957	he	32	" drifters , do n't deserve sensible girls . "
33980	33985	33960	33960	his	32	" I 'm sensible ? "
34030	34033	34034	34034	He	32	" Yeah . "
34067	34070	34064	34064	He	32	" Sensible . "
34073	34076	34064	34064	He	32	" Mature . "
34079	34082	34064	34064	He	32	" Organized . "
34085	34098	34057	34057	his	32	" And so goddamn sexy I ca n't get enough of you . "
34103	34108	34144	34144	he	32	" Maddie , baby . "
34109	34112	34113	34113	She	678	" Mmmm ? "
34135	34143	34144	34144	he	32	" Promise me you wo n't change , "
34149	34154	34144	34144	he	32	" Whatever you want . "
34160	34165	34144	34144	he	32	" Just do n't , "
34168	34171	34144	34144	he	32	" stop . "
34177	34190	34174	34174	his	32	" I like you the way you are . With one exception . "
34191	34201	34202	34202	He	32	" If you tell me will you stop talking ? "
34280	34287	34288	34288	Somebody	682	" Let yourself go for me . "
34302	34309	34310	34310	Linda	60	" He called me a nerd . "
34323	34348	34310	34310	Linda	60	" He called my little sister a nerd ? How dare he ! I mean , it 's not like you were or anything . "
34349	34371	34310	34310	Linda	60	" Shut up , Linda . He hurt my feelings . And I do n't know if I can forgive him . "
34372	34389	34310	34310	Linda	60	" Pete used to call you a nerd back then too , but you forgave him . "
34390	34418	34310	34310	Linda	60	" Pete 's different . He 's always been like a brother , and I expect that sort of behavior from a brother . Not from a — "
34419	34433	34434	34434	Linda	60	" Hunky guy you secretly wished had noticed you when you were fifteen ? "
34472	34502	34503	34503	Linda	60	" He might be cute but I do n't have a crush on him anymore . You know the sort of guys I date . He does n't fit . "
34506	34521	34503	34503	Linda	60	" I suppose . He 's not a doctor , scientist or computer programmer . "
34522	34529	34460	34460	she	60	" And he drives a Porsche . "
34530	34534	34535	34535	Linda	60	" Oh NO ! "
34551	34560	34546	34546	Maddie	31	" So what 's wrong with a Porsche ? "
34561	34589	34590	34590	Linda	60	" Too flashy . People who drive flashy cars want to be the center of attention . And they like to speed . Driving fast is dangerous . "
34596	34614	34615	34615	Maddie	31	" Are we really sisters ? Are you sure you were n't conceived in a test tube ? "
34618	34657	34615	34615	Maddie	31	" I ca n't help it if I do n't like men with flashy cars . Besides , they usually prefer flashy women and have the attention span of an ant so are n't interested in me anyway . "
34658	34672	34590	34590	Linda	60	" I really wonder what you base these theories on sometimes , Mad . "
34673	34700	34701	34701	Linda	60	" Observation . I 'm a scientist , that 's what I do . I test , I observe the results . Same goes for life . "
34704	34733	34701	34701	Linda	60	" Deep . So what 's your scientific observation on how someone like Sam Hennessy ended up earning more in a week than you do in a year ? "
34829	34833	34834	34834	she	31	" It sucks , "
34849	34890	34837	34837	Ronan	37	" I work hard , at the gym and the lab . He does n't even try and look at him . Rich , successful and a body like a God . I bet he does n’t even work out . "
34891	34943	34837	34837	Ronan	37	" We do n't know that . He must do something to keep those buns of steel in superhero shape . And he did work his way up the corporate ladder to become CEO of that paint company in Sydney . It was n’t just handed to him on a platter . "
34944	34969	34837	34837	Ronan	37	" That 's not the point . The point is I worked hard my entire life . Not just the last year or two . "
34970	34980	34981	34981	Linda	60	" Should 've had fun while you were young , "
34985	34998	34981	34981	Linda	60	" Like you ? You call three and a half children fun ? "
35009	35021	35004	35004	Ronan	37	" How could your Auntie Mad think you 're not fun ? "
35084	35088	35090	35090	their	694	" This Little Piggy "
35327	35335	35337	35337	Sam	32	" So , you 're a scientist , "
35516	35522	35524	35524	Maddie	31	" I 'm a biochemist , "
35526	35532	35524	35524	Maddie	31	" I work at BioDerma . "
35533	35537	35557	35557	Ronan	37	" Sounds interesting . "
35538	35550	35551	35551	Linda	60	" About as interesting as watching this family at meal time , "
35590	35601	35587	35587	Sam	32	" I think your children are great meal time entertainment . "
35616	35627	35602	35602	He	709	" So what do you do at BioDerma , Maddie ? "
35700	35719	35720	35720	Linda	60	" Maddie 's developing the ultimate s - e - x aid , are n't you , Mad ? "
35769	35782	35783	35783	she	31	" It 's an l - o - v - e potion , "
35798	35808	35810	35810	Linda	60	" Love is n't a dirty word , Maddie , "
35817	35833	35814	35814	David	35	" You would n't say that if you 'd dated half the guys I have . "
35858	35864	35865	35865	Sam	32	" Tell me about it , "
35868	35878	35879	35879	He	32	" You want to hear about my bad dates ? "
35882	35894	35879	35879	He	32	" No , I want to hear about the love potion . "
35906	35912	35913	35913	she	31	" Subliminal odors or pheromones , "
35932	35974	35913	35913	she	31	" influence an animal 's choice of a mate and help develop bonding . There 's a theory that humans also respond to pheromones . In other words , subconsciously we 're attracted to people whose pheromones are compatible with ours . "
35975	35985	35986	35986	She	31	" So , you 're creating a fake pheromone ? "
35989	36016	35986	35986	She	31	" BioDerma 's been commissioned by a perfume company to develop a synthetic pheromone that will have maximum impact for a large proportion of the population . "
36017	36031	35986	35986	She	31	" So those who would n't usually find the wearer attractive , will . "
36061	36065	36067	36067	Pete	38	" Sounds interesting , "
36069	36082	36067	36067	Pete	38	" Who 's going to test it out on the unsuspecting public ? "
36083	36088	36053	36053	She	31	" Fred and Wilma . "
36089	36093	36067	36067	Pete	38	" The Flintstones ? "
36094	36108	36067	36067	Pete	38	" Lab mice . We 'll also conduct a trial using human volunteers . "
36109	36113	36114	36114	Pete	38	" Lucky them , "
36125	36128	36117	36117	Linda	60	" What ? "
36163	36167	36168	36168	he	38	" Sounds dangerous , "
36171	36176	36168	36168	he	38	" Are you kidding ? "
36185	36210	36177	36177	Pete	38	" Imagine having women fall all over you when you walk down the street . I 'd volunteer for the trial in a second . "
36248	36264	36265	36265	He	38	" If I were a single guy , that is . Which I 'm not . "
36271	36277	36278	36278	She	60	" And I love you . "
36281	36291	36292	36292	Sam	32	" A love potion like that is completely unethical , "
36417	36428	36429	36429	she	31	" It 's non - toxic and non - allergenic , "
36432	36457	36458	36458	he	32	" I 'm talking about manipulation . If this stuff actually works , then the implications are enormous . Imagine if people start having ... "
36471	36512	36461	36461	Emily	36	" ... s - e - x with people they 're not really attracted to . Imagine if people start thinking they 're in love when in fact it 's just a false hormonal response . It could ruin lives . "
36544	36557	36558	36558	she	31	" I do n't see how love can be a bad thing , "
36610	36633	36634	36634	She	31	" It can be if it 's directed at the wrong person . And if the subjects believe they 're in love . "
36644	36659	36634	36634	She	31	" Since when do CEOs of multi - national corporations concern themselves with ethics ? "
36669	36696	36697	36697	She	31	" Or are you going to tell me the paint sold by National Paints is completely harmless to fish if I tip it into the ocean ? "
36785	36790	36791	36791	he	32	" You 're right , "
36798	36817	36791	36791	he	32	" Let 's not argue about this . Although it 's an interesting discussion . Maybe we could — "
36818	36822	36823	36823	Emily	36	" Auntie Mad . "
36829	36836	36823	36823	Emily	36	" Can I have ithe cweam ? "
36837	36840	36791	36791	he	32	" Huh ? "
36856	36874	36845	36845	Maddie	31	" Oh , ice cream , sure thing , Sugar . Want to come and help me ? "
36875	36881	36883	36883	Linda	60	" I 'll come too , "
37010	37019	37005	37005	Emily	36	" Auntie Mad , what are you doing ? "
37020	37026	37039	37039	Linda	60	" Looking for ice cream . "
37027	37037	37039	37039	Linda	60	" And if she does n't find it soon , "
37049	37059	37039	37039	Linda	60	" she 's going to turn into an Eskimo . "
37063	37068	37060	37060	Emily	36	" What’th an ethkimo ? "
37083	37109	37069	37069	Maddie	31	" It ’s a person who lives in the North Pole which is where I 'm running away to as soon as dinner 's over . "
37110	37115	37116	37116	Linda	60	" Are you crazy ? "
37119	37124	37125	37125	Maddie	31	" He wants you . "
37131	37148	37149	37149	Linda	60	" He does n't want me , he just wants to debate the ethics of Pheramour . "
37163	37174	37149	37149	Linda	60	" Did n't you see that look in his eyes ? "
37175	37188	37189	37189	Linda	60	" The I'm - right - and - you're - wrong look ? "
37197	37223	37189	37189	Linda	60	" What 's wrong with you ? There 's a gorgeous man out there who wants you and you 're hiding out in the kitchen . "
37229	37249	37250	37250	Linda	60	" Are you sure he wants me and is n't just trying to beat the nerd in a debate ? "
37258	37262	37263	37263	She	60	" Fairly sure . "
37269	37306	37263	37263	She	60	" Okay , I 'm not , but what the hell . You 're single and cute and you should be sending out available signals instead of talking about your work . Get back in there . "
37307	37322	37250	37250	Linda	60	" Not without ice cream . Speaking of which , where 's my bowl ? "
37323	37354	37263	37263	She	60	" Are you crazy ? You ca n't eat ice cream . It 'll go straight to your hips and you never know who might be holding onto them soon . "
37355	37373	37374	37374	Linda	60	" Linda ! I am not going to have s - e - x with Sam Hennessy ! "
37381	37392	37374	37374	Linda	60	" Why not ? Do n't you find him hunky ? "
37414	37421	37397	37397	Maddie	31	" That 's not the point . "
37422	37430	37431	37432	Her sister	133	" It is to me . Well ? "
37449	37455	37456	37456	Emily	36	" Your mother is unbelievable . "
37466	37507	37508	37508	Linda	60	" Yeah , I find him hunky . But that 's all . He 's nice to look at but that 's not enough to interest me . So stop trying to set me up with him . Got it ? "
37511	37518	37508	37508	Linda	60	" Whatever you say , Mad . "
37911	37914	37916	37916	Emily	36	" Tham , "
37948	37953	37935	37935	her	36	" Yes , Pumpkin ? "
37954	37961	37935	37935	her	36	" You know my Auntie Mad ? "
37962	37965	37935	37935	her	36	" Yes . "
37966	37973	37935	37935	her	36	" Thee thinkth you 're chunky . "
37981	37991	37976	37976	Sam	32	" Are you sure that 's what she said ? "
37996	37999	37992	37992	Emily	36	" Oh . "
38141	38149	38150	38150	he	32	" What do you think that means ? "
38170	38176	38177	38177	Pete	38	" I have no idea , "
38180	38200	38177	38177	Pete	38	" Maybe she 's referring to your muscles . You 're not as skinny as you used to be . "
38243	38248	38250	38250	Pete	38	" Where 's mine ? "
38252	38263	38264	38264	Maddie	31	" If he 's having some then so am I , "
38267	38270	38264	38264	Maddie	31	" Sam ? "
38271	38283	38301	38301	she	31	" Maybe I should n't . Unless it 's low fat . "
38284	38288	38289	38289	she	31	" Low fat ? "
38349	38353	38354	38354	Sam	32	" Thank you , "
38363	38367	38360	38360	She	31	" What for ? "
38368	38378	38417	38417	He	32	" For forgiving me for calling you a nerd . "
38379	38401	38360	38360	She	31	" Like you said , it was a long time ago . I was probably being silly for worrying about it . "
38402	38416	38417	38417	He	32	" Yeah , but it did worry you , and that worried me . "
38450	38475	38445	38445	He	32	" Maddie , I want you to know that I think you 're perfect the way you are . Do n't change a thing . "
38476	38487	38506	38506	his	32	" Not even the tendency to over - plan everything ? "
38488	38503	38504	38504	He	32	" Especially that . I need that in my life . Speaking of which . "
38519	38536	38504	38504	He	32	" I 'm sure you have a plan for what you 're going to do next . "
38544	38549	38537	38537	She	31	" I certainly do . "
38553	38579	38550	38550	He	32	" I like that plan , but I was referring to your life outside the bedroom . Are you going to look for another job ? "
38580	38619	38504	38504	He	32	" Actually , I 've been doing something a little different these last few days . I was thinking of getting into decorating . Turns out I 've got a knack for it . Who 'd have guessed ? "
38620	38623	38624	38624	He	32	" Me . "
38635	38658	38624	38624	He	32	" I saw you had good taste as soon as I walked into this place . So how about we team up ? "
38659	38665	38504	38504	He	32	" What do you mean ? "
38666	38715	38504	38504	He	32	" I mean I 'll renovate old houses and you 'll put the finishing touches on them . Curtains , tiles , paint colors , that sort of thing . We 'll sell at a profit if we buy the right sort of house in the right area . "
38724	38731	38716	38716	He	32	" So what do you think ? "
38732	38753	38504	38504	He	32	" I think that you just made a plan , Sam Hennessy . The stars must be aligned or something . "
38754	38775	38776	38776	She	31	" Is it a plan that you like , though ? It would mean spending a bit of time together . "
38786	38799	38776	38776	She	31	" In that case , count me in . On one condition . "
38800	38803	38504	38504	He	32	" What ? "
38804	38819	38504	38504	He	32	" That you help me to loosen up . Teach me to be spontaneous . "
38820	38831	38832	38832	He	32	" I said I liked you the way you are . "
38845	38869	38832	38832	He	32	" But sure , whatever you want . Let 's start now . I know a great way to help you loosen up . "
38950	38955	38957	38964	the spiky - haired kid on the TV	753	" You 're boring , "
39017	39020	39021	39021	she	70	" Boring ? "
39147	39154	39155	39155	She	70	" What do you mean boring ? "
39254	39270	39271	39273	Dug - E	98	" Yeah , you heard me . You 're all as dull as , as ... "
39291	39297	39277	39277	his	764	" ... as my mother . "
39309	39315	39317	39318	Bob Horton	97	" Hello , Mrs. Douglas , "
39326	39333	39317	39318	Bob Horton	97	" Nice to see you again . "
39399	39406	39407	39408	Mrs. Douglas	99	" You must forgive my son , "
39411	39418	39407	39408	Mrs. Douglas	99	" But he has a point . "
39419	39423	39424	39424	Bob	97	" A point ? "
39427	39435	39436	39436	she	770	" Yes , a very valid point , "
39454	39511	39512	39512	she	770	" He 's a young , up - and - coming artist , Mr. Horton . He needs freedom to express his personality through his music , and his life outside of music . He feels — we both feel — that a younger , more hip agent would understand him better . I do apologize , "
39516	39529	39512	39512	she	770	" But we feel Douglas 's talent should be nurtured not stifled . "
39563	39571	39572	39572	Bob	97	" Right , er , of course , "
39575	39592	39572	39572	Bob	97	" That 's a real shame , though . We have some great ideas for him . "
39602	39612	39613	39613	she	770	" You 're not giving up yet are you ? "
39621	39626	39613	39613	she	770	" Just like that ? "
39627	39639	39640	39640	he	97	" He 's not interested , Annie , let it go , "
39681	39687	39688	39688	she	70	" What did you say ? "
39905	39909	39910	39910	Bob	97	" We understand , "
40012	40041	40042	40042	He	97	" I was saying that we have the perfect agent for your son , Mrs. Douglas . She 's young , she's ... er , hip and wired . "
40048	40075	40046	40046	himself	97	" Yeah , wired . We think she 'd be perfect for your son . She knows all the happening places . All the cool gigs . "
40097	40104	40105	40107	Dug - E	98	" Well , where is she ? "
40154	40158	40150	40150	Bob	97	" Right here . "
40173	40182	40150	40150	Bob	97	" Um , Bob , can we talk — "
40183	40186	40187	40187	he	97	" Later , "
40208	40212	40213	40213	Bob	97	" Annie McCallum , "
40233	40238	40216	40220	The pimply boy on screen	802	" Nup . Boring . "
40293	40305	40306	40306	Bob	97	" She 's very far from boring , Dug - E , "
40414	40421	40422	40422	he	807	" She 's wearing a suit , "
40425	40441	40442	40442	Bob	97	" Er , that 's only because we make her wear one in the office . "
40447	40482	40442	40442	Bob	97	" She 's really one wild girl . She rides a motorbike to work and parties all night . Oh yeah , and she always comes to work hungover , do n't you Annie ? "
40516	40519	40520	40520	Bob	97	" Annie ? "
40536	40539	40540	40540	she	70	" Yeah , "
40557	40564	40547	40547	she'd	70	" I 'm real ... bad . "
40597	40603	40589	40591	Dug - E	98	" What sort of bike ? "
40614	40618	40619	40619	she	70	" A Ducati , "
40664	40667	40668	40668	he	98	" Fine , "
40671	40680	40668	40668	he	98	" Real fine . How does she do ? "
40693	40704	40686	40686	they	811	" Um , good . Rides like ... the wind . "
40728	40737	40738	40738	she	70	" She 's a beautiful piece of metal , "
40741	40758	40792	40792	he	98	" She 's more than metal , Lady , she 's a sweet piece of ass . "
40759	40764	40765	40767	Dug - E	98	" Yeah , sweet . "
40806	40836	40795	40795	He	98	" Okay , I 'll give her a chance . But if she does n't live up to my high standards , I 'm going with Jamieson and Jamieson . "
40887	40901	40878	40878	he	98	" Okay , Annie , you 're our girl . Go for it . "
40907	40922	40902	40902	She	769	" Go for it ? Are you insane ? Have you lost your mind ? "
40923	40934	40878	40878	he	98	" What 's wrong ? You 're perfect for this . "
40935	40949	40950	40950	She	769	" Perfect ! You just made me sound like a ... a rebel . "
40958	40999	40950	40950	She	769	" I do n't know anything about motorbikes or parties or drinking beer . I have n't been drunk since 2006 and even then it was only because someone spiked my soda . I 'm not my father , Bob . "
41054	41060	41061	41061	He	97	" Then you 'll learn . "
41117	41164	41081	41081	he	97	" Look , Annie , you 're our last chance . You 're the only agent under thirty here . Hell , you 're the only agent under fifty . We need you on this one . We ca n't lose Dug - E to Jamiesons . "
41165	41177	41263	41263	She	825	" Why not ? He 's a snotty - nosed little — "
41178	41194	41195	41195	He	97	" Now , now . It 's attitude like that that sends the kids elsewhere . "
41212	41246	41263	41263	She	825	" But I 'm no hip and happening young thing , Bob . I ca n't give Dug - E what he wants . I do n't know what boys his age do . "
41247	41262	41263	41263	She	825	" Do n't worry . I 've got the perfect person to teach you . "
41268	41273	41263	41263	She	825	" Teach me what ? "
41274	41282	41263	41263	She	825	" To ride a motorbike for starters . "
41283	41304	41263	41263	She	825	" You 're really going to make me get on one of those dangerous things ? I could get killed . "
41305	41334	41263	41263	She	825	" Calm down , Annie , you wo n't be killed . He 's a great teacher . He 'll make sure you do n't even fall off . "
41340	41367	41335	41335	She	825	" Gee thanks . Is he going to teach me how to drink beer , swear like a sailor and flash my breasts at passing trucks ? "
41371	41378	41368	41368	He	826	" If you ask him nicely . "
41460	41468	41441	41441	she	825	" So who is this amazing teacher ? "
41469	41484	41441	41441	she	825	" A friend of mine . We 've known each other for fifteen years . "
41485	41493	41441	41441	she	825	" Fifteen ? How old is he ? "
41494	41499	41441	41441	she	825	" Thirty - four . "
41500	41511	41441	41441	she	825	" Is n't that too old to be a rebel ? "
41537	41545	41441	41441	she	825	" He 's perfect for the job . "
41553	41567	41546	41546	She	825	" I ca n't wait to meet him . What 's his name ? "
41568	41572	41441	41441	she	825	" Zack DiMarco . "
41583	41587	41577	41577	Bob	97	" The millionaire ? "
41588	41594	41546	41546	She	825	" No . The billionaire . "
41595	41610	41577	41577	Bob	97	" Why would Zack DiMarco teach me to ride a motorbike and drink beer ? "
41611	41618	41546	41546	She	825	" Because we go way back . "
41619	41625	41577	41577	Bob	97	" You must be close . "
41629	41654	41626	41626	He	97	" I 'll give him a call . I 'm sure he 'll free up some time to take you on as a student . "
41655	41658	41659	41659	She	825	" Yeah . "
41662	41680	41659	41659	She	825	" What better things does a millionaire have to do but teach me to be a rebel ? "
41681	41684	41626	41626	He	97	" Billionaire . "
41698	41701	41688	41688	Zack	107	" Yo . "
41702	41709	41659	41659	She	825	" Zack ? It 's Bob . "
41724	41738	41710	41710	Zack	107	" Hey , Bob . Long time no see . How 's business ? "
41739	41758	41688	41688	Zack	107	" Great . The most lucrative deal of the decade just landed on McCallum and Horton 's table . "
41759	41762	41710	41710	Zack	107	" Yeah ? "
41796	41814	41787	41787	Bob	97	" We 've got the chance to sign up a young rapper , Dug - E Dug — "
41815	41821	41822	41822	Zack	107	" That 's his name ? "
41825	41837	41822	41822	Zack	107	" Sounds like a gardening tools manufacturer I bought last week . "
41841	41870	41871	41871	He	97	" He 's about as smart as a shovel too . But we have n't got him yet . He thinks we 're too old for his image . "
41874	41901	41871	41871	He	97	" What would he know ? McCallum and Horton invented cool . We put the hip in hippie , the roll in rock ' n roll . "
41978	41986	41987	41987	Zack	107	" So , how can I help ? "
42036	42044	42045	42045	Bob	97	" Mac 's daughter works for us , "
42048	42060	42045	42045	Bob	97	" She 's a nice girl . A great girl actually . "
42073	42082	42065	42065	he	97	" I think you 've mentioned her before . "
42083	42105	42065	42065	he	97	" She 's our best shot at getting Dug - E but she 's a little on the ... conservative side . "
42106	42124	42065	42065	he	97	" Your late partner 's daughter ? So she 's not a chip off the old block ? "
42125	42140	42065	42065	he	97	" Not even a splinter . She was never into the scene like Mac . "
42247	42260	42261	42261	Bob	97	" I want you to show her a good time , Zack , "
42264	42281	42261	42261	Bob	97	" Take her to parties , teach her about motorbikes , sex her up a bit . "
42282	42293	42261	42261	Bob	97	" Turn her into the party animal her father was . "
42294	42307	42261	42261	Bob	97	" Exactly . And I need it done in the next week . "
42332	42371	42324	42324	Life	110	" No sweat . I 'll turn her into a woman everyone wants to know . Dug - E will think she 's the coolest person on the West Coast by the time I 've finished with her . "
43305	43309	43290	43290	He	69	" Pick up laundry "
43311	43317	43290	43290	He	69	" Press Ctl+Alt+Delete to shut down "
43506	43509	43510	43510	She	31	" Ready ? "
43541	43548	43534	43534	She	31	" You startled me , Beaker . "
43549	43567	43568	43568	She	31	" Sorry , I thought you 'd seen me , considering you were staring straight at me . "
43627	43634	43635	43635	she	31	" Okay , let 's go , "
43749	43752	43741	43742	Their boss	900	" Good morning "
43834	43839	43840	43840	Beaker	69	" He looks ready , "
43857	43874	43840	43840	Beaker	69	" I think he 's ready for something , but I 'm not sure about love . "
43875	43892	43893	43893	She	31	" No man is ever ready for love . It hits him like a speeding bus . "
43896	43904	43905	43905	Beaker	69	" Painful . And kind of messy . "
43908	43912	43905	43905	Beaker	69	" Sure is . "
44100	44104	44091	44091	Beaker	69	" Ready Wilma ? "
44258	44267	44269	44269	Beaker	69	" I do n't think it 's working , "
44275	44280	44269	44269	Beaker	69	" Give them time . "
44306	44319	44320	44320	Beaker	69	" Maybe they just need to get used to each other first . "
44323	44335	44320	44320	Beaker	69	" Maybe we should get some candles and play soft music . "
44346	44370	44371	44371	She	31	" We could give them a piece of cheese . That way when they share it , they 'll get nice and cozy . "
44376	44387	44371	44371	She	31	" Or they might just scratch each others eyes out . "
44388	44394	44420	44420	She	31	" You 're so unromantic . "
44395	44419	44420	44420	She	31	" If you 'd dated the guys I have , you 'd understand that romance is a figment of a masochist 's imagination . "
44427	44539	44420	44420	She	31	" Looks like it 's back to the drawing board . She hated this part . They 'd been so sure this time . The preliminary trials had been positive and all the chemical reactions had worked according to cutting edge pheromone theory . They 'd carefully tested chemical with chemical , essential oil with essential oil , noting down the reactions , re - testing , changing ingredients until every permutation had been analyzed . After several months , Maddie was certain they 'd reached the right balance to create a synthetic pheromone that made the wearers more attractive to the opposite sex . They 'd left nothing to chance . "
44549	44568	44420	44420	She	31	" said Beaker , running a hand through hair that did n't need any more encouragement to stand up .
44569	44588	44595	44595	she	31	" We did not write down the wrong figures . I 'd never make a mistake like that . "
44604	44617	44595	44595	she	31	" I do n't understand . It could n't possibly have failed . "
44618	44623	44624	44624	Beaker	69	" Hey , Maddie ! "
44634	44639	44624	44624	Beaker	69	" Check this out . "
44664	44669	44670	44670	he	74	" Must be love , "
44676	44690	44673	44673	She	31	" Typical man . Straight to the end where all the action is . "
44705	44711	44694	44694	Maddie	31	" How 'd it go ? "
44832	44838	44830	44830	he	52	" Let 's go bowling . "
44839	44842	44844	44844	Maddie	31	" Great , "
44856	44886	44844	44844	Maddie	31	" Wilma and Fred are showing all the signs of being two mice in love . If all goes well , we 'll start human trials later this month . "
44892	44905	44906	44906	He	52	" We need to start sooner . I need results , Maddie . "
44914	44946	44947	44947	He	52	" It takes time , Miles , you know that . We need to observe Fred and Wilma 's behavior for at least three weeks before we trial it on humans . "
44955	44963	44947	44947	He	52	" Look , here 's the thing . "
44983	45015	44976	44976	herself	31	" I need to give the Marketing Director at Fleur Elise something on Tuesday . She 's coming to visit and she 's made it clear she expects to see results . "
45016	45058	44981	44981	him	52	" But today 's Friday ! No way . That 's too soon . We need to thoroughly test the reaction between the mice over the next two weeks at least , and document every aspect of their behavior , otherwise — "
45059	45068	45069	45069	He	52	" I know , Maddie , I know . "
45161	45190	45149	45149	his	52	" Miles , we have n't got anything to show yet . Apart from two horny mice , that is . We need to trial it on people — "
45191	45196	45264	45264	Maddie	31	" Then find some . "
45197	45200	45149	45149	his	52	" Miles — "
45201	45260	45261	45261	He	52	" Maddie , listen . I should n't tell you this , but I think you need to understand the importance of Pheramour . This contract with Fleur Elise is vital to the survival of BioDerma . If we ca n't show progress by Tuesday , they 're going to pull the pin . Where that leaves BioDerma ... "
45565	45577	45562	45562	She	31	" I do n't think there are any dangerous side effects . "
45578	45591	45562	45562	She	31	" Good . It 's settled then . You can start tonight . "
45592	45611	45562	45562	She	31	" Tonight ? But , but there ’s too much to do ! I need to organize volunteers — "
45612	45618	45619	45619	Miles	52	" Do we need volunteers ? "
45635	45644	45625	45625	his	52	" Perhaps you and Beaker could do it . "
45694	45711	45714	45714	he	52	" BioDerma needs this , Maddie . Your career and that of your colleagues needs this . "
45726	45729	45714	45714	he	52	" Please . "
45806	45814	45815	45815	she	31	" I guess that would be okay , "
45835	45845	45828	45828	she	31	" Great . Let me know how it goes . "
46287	46297	46298	46298	Linda	60	" Child locks are the best thing ever invented , "
46363	46373	46374	46374	Sam	32	" Does n't he realize it wo n't open ? "
46377	46382	46383	46383	Linda	60	" Sure he does , "
46386	46397	46398	46398	Ronan	37	" He just likes the noise . It 's fun . "
46417	46428	46398	46398	Ronan	37	" So what do you think of my little sister ? "
46532	46543	46529	46529	He	32	" She seems nice . Different to how I remember . "
46624	46628	46629	46629	Linda	60	" Different how ? "
46644	46650	46639	46639	Sam	32	" Older , I suppose . "
46651	46661	46662	46662	He	32	" Fifteen years will do that to a person . "
46669	46677	46678	46678	he	32	" I mean more mature , more ... "
46685	46691	46678	46678	he	32	" ... comfortable with herself . "
46692	46697	46698	46698	Linda	60	" Maddie ? Really ? "
46704	46708	46698	46698	Linda	60	" You disagree ? "
46709	46737	46678	46678	he	32	" No ! Well , maybe a little . To me she 's just my geeky little sister . Although the geekiness has lessened over the years . "
46810	46820	46821	46821	he	32	" I guess she 's a little uptight still , "
46835	46840	46832	46832	Linda	60	" You said it . "
46857	46865	46843	46843	her	60	" Maybe you could help her relax ... "
46866	46871	46872	46872	Emily	36	" Me ? How ? "
46897	46905	46906	46906	Linda	60	" Oh , I do n't know , "
46909	46922	46906	46906	Linda	60	" Take her out maybe . Help her have a good time . "
46931	46937	46906	46906	Linda	60	" Like on a date ? "
46938	46956	46957	46957	He	968	" No , of course not . Just something casual , like two old friends catching up . "
47003	47024	46994	46994	Maddie	31	" But would she go out with me ? I mean , as friends ? We were n't exactly close . "
47041	47053	47054	47054	She	60	" You 're beginning to drive me nuts , young man . "
47065	47070	47071	47071	She	60	" Knock yourself out . "
47076	47101	47071	47071	She	60	" Where were we ? Oh yes , taking Maddie out . And yes , she 'll go out with you . Trust me . "
47102	47108	47109	47109	he	37	" I do n't know , "
47112	47120	47109	47109	he	37	" I 'm not really her type . "
47121	47126	47127	47127	She	60	" Yes you are . "
47139	47160	47127	47127	She	60	" But just in case , I 'll send you there on an errand so it does n't look contrived . "
47165	47168	47169	47169	he	37	" Okay , "
47182	47190	47191	47191	she	60	" So , how 's your job ? "
47194	47204	47191	47191	she	60	" Any plans to move back to Melbourne permanently ? "
47205	47215	47237	47237	Linda	60	" Actually , I do . I 've quit . "
47216	47226	47227	47227	He	37	" What ! But you were earning a fortune ! "
47230	47236	47227	47227	He	37	" It 's only money . "
47283	47289	47290	47290	she	60	" I had no idea , "
47293	47302	47290	47290	she	60	" Why did n't you say something earlier ? "
47303	47310	47311	47311	She	60	" I told Pete last night . "
47316	47332	47311	47311	She	60	" I 'll have to have a word to your daddy when he gets home . "
47339	47350	47333	47333	She	60	" But why ? You had it all in Sydney . "
47351	47374	47375	47375	She	60	" No , Linda , I did n't . And does it matter why ? I 've quit and it 's final . "
47393	47401	47402	47402	She	60	" Okay , I get the picture . "
47467	47472	47477	47477	he	32	" Mummy , poos . "
47733	47740	47741	47741	she	31	" All right , all right , "
47747	47750	47741	47741	she	31	" Sam ! "
47829	47836	47841	47841	his	32	" What are you doing here ? "
47848	47860	47861	47861	He	32	" Is that any way to treat a man bearing gifts ? "
47867	47876	47861	47861	He	32	" Sorry , I was n't expecting anyone . "
47881	47885	47886	47886	He	32	" Come in . "
47904	47911	47897	47902	The teenager that still lurked inside	977	" Sam Hennessy just touched me ! "
48005	48013	47982	47982	She	31	" So what 's in the bag ? "
48014	48049	48050	48050	He	32	" Your sister asked me to give you this . She said it was important you get it and Pete was working back late and she did n’t want to drag the kids out . "
48060	48078	48056	48056	Maddie	31	" It 's my pair of sneakers she borrowed last year . I 'd forgotten about them . "
48089	48098	48079	48079	She	31	" Not sure I even want them back . "
48099	48104	48105	48105	She	31	" Why the emergency ? "
48160	48176	48147	48147	She	31	" Guess she figured I need to work off the ice cream from last night . "
48231	48245	48246	48246	he	32	" I do n't think you need to worry about the ice cream , "
48333	48340	48341	48341	She	31	" I 'd better get dressed . "
48796	48801	48802	48802	he	32	" Have you eaten ? "
48874	48878	48879	48879	she	31	" Not yet , "
48882	48910	48879	48879	she	31	" I guess I should offer to cook something , but I 'm a terrible cook . I 've been known to boil pots of water dry . "
48911	48919	48951	48951	He	32	" Guess we 'll go out then . "
48920	48923	48924	48924	She	31	" Oh . "
48931	48936	48924	48924	She	31	" I should change . "
48937	48946	48951	48951	He	32	" No need . How 's pizza sound ? "
48947	48950	48951	48951	He	32	" Cheap . "
48976	48988	48967	48967	She	31	" I just expected us to go to an expensive restaurant . "
48989	48999	49016	49016	Her	31	" Because I 'm the CEO of National Paints ? "
49000	49009	48967	48967	She	31	" No , because you 're a millionaire . "
49010	49015	49016	49016	Her	31	" An unemployed millionaire . "
49280	49284	49285	49285	she	31	" What happened ? "
49291	49297	49285	49285	she	31	" Did they fire you ? "
49298	49316	49319	49319	Hennessy	32	" Huh ? Oh , uh , no . And why does everyone keep asking me that ? "
49336	49355	49333	49333	She	31	" It 's just that you got into trouble a lot in high school , so I thought ... "
49356	49366	49367	49367	He	32	" That I was still that high school kid ? "
49370	49386	49367	49367	He	32	" Give me a little credit . I 've changed in the last fifteen years . "
49507	49520	49479	49479	she	31	" Still want to go on a date with an unemployed bum ? "
49521	49532	49533	49533	He	32	" Of course . But maybe we should go Dutch . "
49536	49560	49533	49533	He	32	" No way . I asked you out , so it 's my treat . I think I can still manage a pizza . "
49561	49566	49567	49567	She	31	" Are you sure ? "
49586	49596	49575	49575	she	31	" Because I can eat a lot of pizza . "
49672	49680	49681	49681	she	31	" I told you I liked pizza , "
49684	49693	49681	49681	she	31	" And I 've got a big appetite . "
49694	49709	49660	49660	Sam	32	" I like that in a woman . And you do n't show it . "
49710	49730	49681	49681	she	31	" I hope not . I 've worked hard enough on the treadmill to make sure it does n't . "
49731	49738	49739	49739	He	32	" You run on a treadmill ? "
49744	49773	49741	49741	his	32	" You should try the great outdoors . It 's much more exhilarating running in the open air , the breeze on your skin , the smell of — "
49774	49799	49800	49800	Sam	32	" Dog doo - doo on your shoes ? No thank you . Besides , I run kind of funny . People will laugh . "
49803	49806	49807	49807	He	32	" See ! "
49872	49880	49881	49881	he	32	" I 'm not laughing at you , "
49934	49960	49928	49928	he	32	" If you come jogging with me tomorrow around Albert Park I promise I wo n't laugh . Even if you run like a girl . "
49966	49973	49961	49961	She	31	" I think I 'll pass . "
49974	49977	49978	49978	He	32	" Why ? "
50024	50030	50031	50031	he	32	" It 'll be fun , "
50035	50044	50031	50031	he	32	" I like company when I go jogging . "
50045	50051	50031	50031	he	32	" Well I do n't . "
50143	50150	50151	50151	she	31	" So tell me , Sam , "
50159	50176	50151	50151	she	31	" why did you leave National Paints ? I thought you had a great job there . "
50177	50196	50151	50151	she	31	" I did . I gained a lot of experience , but it was time to move on . "
50197	50208	50151	50151	she	31	" So you 've got another job to go to ? "
50209	50212	50151	50151	she	31	" No . "
50213	50224	50225	50225	He	32	" Oh . But you 'll be looking of course . "
50230	50270	50225	50225	He	32	" I think I 'll start my own business . I 've always wanted to renovate houses . I love restoring old places , peeling back the layers to discover their original glory then breathing new life into them . "
50271	50275	50276	50276	She	1026	" Sounds wonderful . "
50305	50336	50337	50337	He	32	" Old places have character . Take my house for example . It 's got so much character it gets frightened during thunderstorms . Seriously , it trembles and everything . "
50387	50409	50337	50337	He	32	" How about I make your place my first project . You live in an inner city weatherboard do n't you ? "
50414	50423	50337	50337	He	32	" I ca n't afford to pay you . "
50424	50433	50384	50384	his	32	" I wo n't charge an old friend . "
50434	50455	50456	50456	He	32	" We were n't friends . You barely spoke two words to me in high school and when you did — "
50464	50527	50456	50456	He	32	" Okay , okay , I get the picture . So we were n't close . I was two years older , so I guess it 's not surprising . Anyway , I wo n't charge you . You 're my best friend 's sister - in - law . Besides , Linda would skin me if I asked you to pay . "
50569	50577	50578	50578	she	31	" Lucky you worked at National Paints , "
50581	50597	50578	50578	she	31	" I guess you gained a lot of knowledge about the right paints to use . "
50602	50614	50578	50578	she	31	" I guess . I never thought of it that way . "
50615	50625	50578	50578	she	31	" You never planned it to happen like this ? "
50683	50697	50698	50698	He	32	" I only recently decided I wanted to start my own renovating business . "
50701	50735	50698	50698	He	32	" I mean , I 've always been a handy man and I like old houses , but I did n't think about turning my hobby into a job until I quit National . "
50736	50739	50740	50740	She	1029	" Oh . "
50753	50757	50758	50758	she	1029	" How strange , "
50762	50767	50768	50768	He	32	" You think so ? "
50773	50850	50851	50851	he	32	" I never plan too far ahead . I prefer to go with the flow . If a job offer comes my way and it feels right , I take it . When it no longer feels right , I quit . I guess I 'm fortunate in that I 'm in a financial position to start up my own business now . It 'll take a while to get going and money'll get tighter but , "
50854	50868	50851	50851	he	32	" I 'll just ask the bank for a loan when that happens . "
50885	50890	50878	50878	She	31	" madness , just madness "
50911	50928	50929	50929	she	31	" Have you worked out how long you can survive before you 'll need the loan ? "
50932	50935	50929	50929	she	31	" Nope . "
50936	50951	50878	50878	She	31	" But surely you 've got a plan , at least in your head . "
50952	50962	50963	50963	She	31	" A plan ? You mean a financial one ? "
50982	51014	51015	51015	He	32	" Yeah , like the cost of materials , a fee schedule that you 'll charge in the first year , the second and so on until the business becomes viable . "
51018	51039	51015	51015	He	32	" I used to do all that stuff in my day job . It got pretty dull after a while . "
51040	51047	51062	51062	He	32	" The banks will need it . "
51048	51061	51062	51062	He	32	" And I ’ll give it to them when the time comes . "
51080	51096	51062	51062	He	32	" Do n’t worry about it , Maddie . It ’ll all work out fine . "
51269	51275	51276	51276	she	31	" Answer me one question , "
51283	51301	51276	51276	she	31	" How did you get to be CEO of National Paints with such a lousy business brain ? "
51306	51317	51302	51302	His	32	" Gee , do n't spare my feelings or anything . "
51318	51328	51363	51363	his	32	" Sorry . But I am a little curious . "
51332	51357	51358	51358	he	32	" No big secret . I can talk . End of story . I know what to say , when to say it and , "
51373	51379	51358	51358	he	32	" how to say it . "
51437	51461	51432	51432	her	31	" It 's a talent , and it 's got me through more interviews , press releases and meetings than I can count . "
51475	51484	51471	51472	the Pheramour	48	" How many different jobs have you had ? "
51497	51528	51485	51485	He	32	" Including the gig where I dressed as a hot dog at Jerry 's Hot Dog House when I was fifteen , I think it 's about twenty - eight . "
51529	51558	51559	51559	He	32	" Twenty - eight ! I 've only had two . One during university at a book store and this one at BioDerma was my first after uni . "
51577	51590	51559	51559	He	32	" You have n't lived until you 've had at least ten . "
51596	51682	51591	51591	She	31	" I wo n't have that many . I plan on moving up the ranks at BioDerma in the next eight years but after that I 'll consider switching companies , unless BioDerma can offer me something worthwhile to stay . Then I 'll be where I want to be and I 'll retire at around fifty . Of course , if I have children that 'll put everything on hold by about a year but that 's okay because I 've factored that in . "
51715	51726	51701	51701	He	32	" Sounds like you 've got it all figured out . "
52215	52221	52222	52222	Maddie	31	" Where are we going ? "
52225	52229	52222	52222	Maddie	31	" Mount Dandenong . "
52230	52244	52290	52291	a teenager	297	" Make - out Mountain ? I have n't been there for years . "
52245	52269	52290	52291	a teenager	297	" Me either . Thought it would be nice to reminisce up there . It 's got a great view of the city . "
52270	52279	52222	52222	Maddie	31	" It might be full of horny teenagers . "
52431	52444	52446	52446	Maddie	31	" Guess the teenagers have found another place to make - out , "
52468	52474	52460	52460	Sam	32	" Do n't be nervous . "
52475	52483	52484	52484	She	31	" Nervous ? I 'm not nervous . "
52487	52496	52484	52484	She	31	" What makes you think I 'm nervous ? "
52497	52506	52507	52507	She	31	" You 're tearing up my car seat . "
52512	52515	52507	52507	She	31	" Sorry . "
52516	52521	52522	52522	He	32	" Do n't be . "
52561	52568	52522	52522	He	32	" They 're just car seats . "
52569	52574	52575	52575	He	32	" Expensive car seats . "
52589	52612	52580	52580	his	32	" Do n't worry about it . I 'll be selling the Porsche now that I 'm going into the building trade . "
52667	52676	52657	52658	Mr. Dixon	115	" See ! I did amount to something . "
52865	52870	52861	52861	her	266	" She 's a floozy "
53077	53080	53059	53059	He	32	" Sam ? "
53081	53084	53059	53059	He	32	" Hmmm ? "
53085	53092	53093	53093	She	31	" Why are you sniffing me ? "
53108	53116	53117	53117	She	31	" I like the way you smell . "
53122	53128	53119	53119	her	31	" You can smell it ? "
53129	53135	53136	53136	He	32	" Your perfume ? Yeah . "
53173	53181	53165	53165	she	31	" I 'm not wearing any perfume . "
53182	53197	53233	53233	she	31	" Then it must be just you . You smell like my favorite flower . "
53198	53203	53233	53233	she	31	" What 's that ? "
53204	53212	53213	53213	She	31	" The one that smells like you . "
53216	53228	53213	53213	She	31	" Using all your old lines on me , Sam Hennessy ? "
53254	53264	53238	53238	He	32	" I do n't have any lines , Maddie . "
53291	53297	53265	53265	He	32	" Not any more anyway . "
53298	53301	53302	53302	He	32	" Riiiight . "
53319	53328	53329	53329	he	32	" Are you mad at me for something ? "
53615	53618	53619	53619	she	31	" No , "
53622	53636	53619	53619	she	31	" I 'm not mad at you . I was just kidding around . "
53654	53657	53619	53619	she	31	" Oh . "
53701	53717	53718	53718	he	32	" Good . I would n't want you to get the wrong impression of me , "
53721	53735	53718	53718	he	32	" I ’m not the kind of guy I was in high school . "
53736	53744	53745	53745	she	31	" What kind of guy is that ? "
53749	53764	53745	53745	she	31	" The kind that did n’t know a great girl when he met one . "
53786	53801	53802	53802	she	31	" And I would n't want you to get the wrong impression of me , "
53900	53906	53907	53907	he	32	" No wrong impressions here , "
53973	53978	53979	53979	Her	31	" Oh . Good . "
53995	54006	53992	53993	Mickey Mouse	117	" So are you taking me home now or what ? "
54008	54011	53979	53979	Her	31	" or what "
54486	54491	54492	54492	He	32	" What 's wrong ? "
54545	54559	54534	54534	you	1102	" Nothing . But I think I 'd like to go home now . "
54751	54754	54755	54755	Sam	32	" Maddie , "
54777	54802	54766	54766	He	32	" I 'm sorry if I did something I should n't have up there . I just could n't help myself . Forgive me ? "
54836	54841	54842	54842	she	31	" Nothing to forgive , "
54846	54855	54842	54842	she	31	" It was just as much my fault . "
54856	54860	54861	54861	His	32	" Sure was . "
54868	54874	54861	54861	His	32	" Can I come inside ? "
54879	54891	54861	54861	His	32	" I do n't think that would be a good idea . "
54892	54902	54908	54908	she	31	" Why ? Afraid I 'll kiss you again ? "
55022	55026	55027	55027	Sam	32	" Beautiful night , "
55031	55079	55027	55027	Sam	32	" I miss Melbourne 's nights . Sydney 's just are n't the same . Sounds silly I suppose , but the stars seem brighter down here . It 's nice to come home and just sit outside like this on a warm night and watch them . "
55080	55093	55156	55156	His	32	" You still consider Melbourne home , even after all these years ? "
55094	55109	55156	55156	His	32	" Yeah . I did a hell of a lot of growing up here . "
55110	55141	55142	55142	He	32	" You did a hell of a lot of all sorts of things , but is that a reason to come back ? Especially when everything 's changed so much ? "
55150	55155	55142	55142	He	32	" Some things changed . "
55167	55188	55189	55189	He	32	" Others not so much , but I see them differently now . Maybe that 's why I 'm back . "
55202	55214	55189	55189	He	32	" To discover the things I missed the first time round . "
55235	55238	55239	55239	he	32	" Relax , "
55245	55250	55239	55239	he	32	" I ’m relaxed . "
55358	55361	55362	55362	he	32	" Maddie , "
55370	55373	55362	55362	he	32	" Hmmm ? "
55474	55483	55463	55463	They	1118	" Are you going to invite me inside ? "
55504	55511	55512	55512	she	31	" It ’s nice out here , "
55515	55525	55512	55512	she	31	" Yeah , but these steps are getting hard . "
55526	55533	55534	55534	She	31	" Your car seats are soft . "
55616	55627	55628	55628	She	31	" But so is my couch . Let ’s go . "
55648	55658	55659	55659	He	32	" Yep , they ’re softer than the steps . "
55695	55698	55699	55699	she	31	" Coffee ? "
55702	55708	55699	55699	she	31	" Got any ice cream ? "
55715	55721	55709	55709	He	32	" You want ice cream ? "
55722	55729	55699	55699	she	31	" Yeah , sure . Why ? "
55730	55733	55734	55734	she	31	" Well , "
55739	55746	55734	55734	she	31	" it ’s not very sophisticated . "
55750	55759	55747	55747	He	32	" I ’m not a very sophisticated guy . "
55760	55767	55768	55768	she	31	" It ’s not low fat , "
55771	55774	55768	55768	she	31	" Good . "
55979	55987	55991	55991	he	32	" Here , let me get that . "
56186	56191	56192	56192	he	32	" That ’s better , "
56198	56205	56192	56192	he	32	" Now , how about seconds ? "
56663	56670	56658	56658	She	31	" I have to get it . "
56671	56677	56678	56678	he	32	" No you do n’t , "
56681	56703	56678	56678	he	32	" I ’ll never be able to keep my mind on the task if I do n’t know who ’s calling . "
56718	56721	56722	56722	she	31	" What ? "
56736	56741	56722	56722	she	31	" It ’s me , "
56750	56758	56743	56743	Linda	60	" What ’s wrong ? Everyone okay ? "
56759	56770	56722	56722	she	31	" Yeah , sure . Why would n’t they be ? "
56771	56779	56722	56722	she	31	" Because you ’re ringing me at , "
56785	56797	56780	56780	Maddie	31	" quarter past eleven . Should n’t you be in bed ? "
56798	56803	56804	56804	Linda	60	" Should n’t you ? "
56809	56828	56804	56804	Linda	60	" Well ? How ’d it go ? Did you kiss him ? Did you do the deed ? "
56942	56945	56946	56946	Linda	60	" Well ? "
56957	56968	56949	56949	Pete	38	" Hang up the phone and come back to bed . "
56969	56978	56979	56979	Maddie	31	" Do as your husband says for once , "
56984	56991	56979	56979	Maddie	31	" I ’ve got ta go . "
57113	57125	57097	57097	She	31	" Boy , I ’m tired . Really , really tired . "
57157	57167	57146	57146	he	32	" Guess we ’ll see each other around sometime . "
57168	57178	57204	57204	he	32	" Yeah , sure . Thanks for the date . "
57179	57186	57187	57187	He	32	" Thanks for the ice cream . "
57207	57211	57204	57204	he	32	" and everything . "
57268	57271	57272	57272	he	32	" Bye , "
57689	57698	57703	57703	Pete	38	" Hey , Sam - my - man ! "
57730	57736	57738	57738	David	35	" Come play with us , "
57767	57770	57771	57771	he	38	" Thanks , "
57776	57784	57771	57771	he	38	" Did you hurt yourself , Sweetheart ? "
57799	57802	57803	57803	She	36	" Ow . "
57818	57830	57814	57814	Sam	32	" Do you think a milkshake will make it feel better ? "
57835	57838	57814	57814	Sam	32	" Chocolate ? "
57839	57849	57803	57803	She	36	" Of course . Is there any other kind ? "
57850	57856	57857	57857	Pete	38	" Not for a female , "
57860	57864	57866	57866	David	35	" But Dad , "
57874	57885	57866	57866	David	35	" I thought we were gon na kick the footy . "
57886	57894	57896	57896	Sam	32	" How about we play ball first , "
57898	57904	57896	57896	Sam	32	" and have milkshakes after . "
57938	57946	57948	57948	Pete	38	" You 're a natural at this , "
57950	57960	57948	57948	Pete	38	" Ever thought of having any of your own ? "
57961	57964	57970	57970	he	1137	" Sure . "
57981	57992	57993	57993	He	1137	" I just have n't found the right woman yet . "
58014	58028	58011	58011	Pete	38	" Maybe you and my sister - in - law should get together . "
58040	58062	58011	58011	Pete	38	" Linda tells me Maddie wanted to have kids by now , but she has n't found the right man yet . "
58063	58066	58067	58067	Sam	32	" Really ? "
58119	58141	58098	58098	her	36	" Yeah . And Heaven forbid Maddie 's plan should be off - schedule . You remember what she 's like . "
58142	58170	58098	58098	her	36	" Not really . I remember her being smart and shy , but that 's about all . Did Linda tell you I saw her last night ? "
58171	58186	58098	58098	her	36	" Yeah , she said something about it . Did you bump into her ? "
58187	58209	58210	58210	Pete	38	" Not exactly . We went on a date . Your wife thought it would be fun to set us up . "
58235	58247	58248	58248	He	38	" Good shot , David , your aim 's getting better . "
58254	58290	58291	58291	He	38	" My wife set you up on a date with her little sister ? I really need to talk to Linda about letting me in on her schemes before she puts her foot in it . "
58301	58315	58291	58291	He	38	" So , how was it ? Did you get to first base ? "
58316	58335	58291	58291	He	38	" Pete , we 're not in high school anymore . I do n't kiss and tell now . "
58336	58346	58347	58347	Sam	32	" Ah ha , so you did kiss her . "
58350	58375	58376	58376	Pete	38	" I 've changed these last few years . I do n't count a date 's success by the number of bases I reached . "
58379	58410	58376	58376	Pete	38	" That 's it , we 've officially hit middle age . You were my last hope and look what 's happened . You 've gone all respectable on me . "
58479	58489	58490	58490	Pete	38	" So are you going to see her again ? "
58511	58514	58515	58515	he	32	" Yeah , "
58520	58526	58515	58515	he	32	" I think I will . "
58533	58545	58527	58527	David	35	" Hey , Sam , can we have our milkshakes now ? "
58546	58553	58554	58554	Emily	36	" Sure thing . Ready Emily ? "
58573	58580	58554	58554	Emily	36	" Weady . Let’th go Tham . "
59022	59027	59008	59008	He	32	" You 're early . "
59028	59034	59035	59035	His	32	" I could n't wait . "
59046	59054	59058	59058	she	31	" I 'm glad I did n't . "
59066	59079	59058	59058	she	31	" I 'm beginning to think your timing is off on purpose . "
59080	59087	59088	59088	She	31	" I 'm only a man . "
59112	59118	59119	59119	she	31	" Help yourself to coffee , "
59125	59132	59119	59119	she	31	" I wo n't be long . "
59133	59137	59138	59138	he	32	" You know , "
59155	59166	59138	59138	he	32	" you do n't have to get dressed right away . "
59184	59190	59175	59175	he	32	" I do n't mind . "
59305	59309	59310	59310	she	31	" Do n't , "
59581	59584	59585	59585	she	31	" Ready , "
59629	59634	59635	59635	he	32	" You look fantastic , "
59646	59651	59652	59652	She	31	" Let 's go . "
59659	59662	59652	59652	She	31	" Wait . "
59680	59683	59663	59663	He	32	" Better . "
59684	59687	59688	59688	She	31	" Really ? "
59697	59710	59688	59688	She	31	" I always thought it made me look like a shaggy dog . "
59711	59722	59726	59726	he	32	" You 're cute but you 're not that cute . "
59761	59766	59755	59755	His	32	" I was kidding . "
59814	59820	59821	59821	she	31	" Where are we going ? "
59883	59887	59888	59888	he	32	" The market , "
60058	60071	60072	60072	He	32	" What will your mother do with a cup and no saucer ? "
60090	60111	60112	60112	He	32	" It looks like one she already owns . If she breaks the original she can replace it with this . "
60117	60128	60112	60112	He	32	" See , I 'm thinking ahead , like you . "
60129	60132	60072	60072	He	32	" Me ? "
60133	60145	60146	60146	She	31	" Yeah . You know how you like to plan ahead . "
60149	60153	60146	60146	She	31	" You noticed ? "
60154	60203	60072	60072	He	32	" Well , yeah . How could I not ? You directed me here so we 'd miss the traffic and you planned our route around the market so we 'd hit the ice cream stand at five minutes past one when you figured you 'd be hungry . "
60204	60223	60146	60146	She	31	" I said around one , not five past . Besides , that 's all logical and efficient . "
60224	60231	60232	60232	He	1170	" I know . Good thinking . "
60246	60262	60232	60232	He	1170	" Being efficient and logical is just sensible . You got a problem with that ? "
60368	60384	60385	60385	he	1170	" I would n't have noticed your planning fetish unless Pete and Linda mentioned it , "
60388	60392	60393	60393	she	31	" Oh really , "
60397	60404	60393	60393	she	31	" Remind me to thank them . "
60416	60440	60405	60405	He	1170	" Do n't be mad at them . It 's a good trait . I like a woman who knows what she wants . "
60606	60616	60617	60617	She	31	" Justin ! How nice to see you again . "
60683	60688	60690	60698	the tall , blond jerk ... er , jock	1179	" You look great , "
60700	60707	60708	60708	He	49	" Done something with your hair ? "
60779	60787	60789	60789	Justin	49	" Oh well , got ta go , "
60800	60805	60806	60806	Sam	32	" Who was that ? "
60809	60821	60806	60806	Sam	32	" Looks like he should be performing in a boy band . "
60822	60826	60827	60827	Maddie	31	" Very funny , "
60834	60843	60827	60827	Maddie	31	" Actually Justin and I used to date . "
60844	60850	60851	60851	She	31	" You dated that jerk ? "
60856	60883	60851	60851	She	31	" Wow , you 're good . It took me over a month to realize that . Maybe I should take you on my next dates — "
60967	60973	60974	60974	he	49	" We need to talk , "
60983	60997	60974	60974	he	49	" I ’ve got something to say to you . But not here . "
61004	61017	61018	61018	She	31	" Wait ! I want to see the rest of the market . "
61078	61088	61089	61089	he	49	" Okay , we 'll walk around some more , "
61098	61107	61089	61089	he	49	" Then we 're going somewhere to talk . "
61137	61147	61148	61148	she	31	" Oh , look at these little jump suits , "
61160	61171	61148	61148	she	31	" Would n't Ronan look cute in one of these ? "
61172	61176	61177	61177	Sam	32	" Very cute . "
61221	61227	61228	61228	she	31	" I 'm getting one , "
61231	61245	61228	61228	she	31	" While you do , I 'm paying a visit to the gents . "
61285	61298	61300	61304	the man behind the table	1189	" Are you interested in one of those jump suits , Ma'am ? "
61310	61318	61308	61308	Maddie	31	" I 'll take this blue one . "
61319	61323	61324	61324	He	32	" Great choice . "
61412	61419	61420	61420	He	32	" Was that guy your boyfriend ? "
61496	61503	61504	61504	she	31	" He 's just a friend , "
61517	61532	61507	61508	The man	1091	" Good . In that case , would you go out with me tonight ? "
61738	61744	61745	61745	she	31	" I 'm busy tonight , "
61751	61757	61745	61745	she	31	" But thanks for asking . "
62122	62129	62118	62118	he	32	" Guess what I was thinking . "
62142	62154	62118	62118	he	32	" Have they still got the paddle boats on the ake ? "
62155	62158	62118	62118	he	32	" Huh ? "
62167	62179	62165	62165	Maddie	31	" Want to go for a ride on a paddle boat ? "
62298	62301	62302	62302	she	31	" Sure , "
62305	62310	62302	62302	she	31	" Let 's go . "
62373	62384	62386	62386	Sam	32	" This reminds me of when I was a kid , "
62438	62456	62478	62478	He	32	" Are you going to help me here or do I have to do all the work ? "
62457	62477	62478	62478	He	32	" You 're doing so well on your own , and I 'm enjoying the scenery more this way . "
62560	62565	62566	62566	he	32	" This is nice , "
62569	62577	62566	62566	he	32	" Just like when we were teenagers . "
62590	62603	62578	62578	She	31	" I do n't recall coming here with you as a teenager . "
62604	62626	62627	62627	He	32	" You came here with your friends , right ? Pete and I used to pick up girls in these boats . "
62630	62664	62627	62627	He	32	" Actually , we used to bump their boats until they fell in the water and got all wet . That 's how we found out Mary Ellen did n't wear a bra . "
62665	62674	62578	62578	She	31	" Mary Ellen 's got four kids now . "
62697	62703	62704	62704	Sam	32	" So what about you ? "
62714	62721	62722	62722	He	32	" I always wear a bra . "
62725	62746	62722	62722	He	32	" I mean , did you come down here and drive the men crazy in your wet T - shirt ? "
62759	62764	62747	62747	His	32	" Not exactly crazy . "
62824	62829	62830	62830	His	32	" You would now . "
62946	62952	62953	62953	he	32	" You feel so good , "
62959	62968	62953	62953	he	32	" So soft . And you smell fantastic . "
62995	63004	62993	62993	Sam	32	" I think we should go back now . "
63018	63022	63023	63023	he	32	" Not yet , "
63247	63253	63244	63244	He	32	" What are you doing ? "
63257	63269	63244	63244	He	32	" You 're not going in the water , are you ? "
63270	63280	63281	63281	He	32	" Why not ? I need to cool off . "
63288	63298	63281	63281	He	32	" You look a little hot yourself . Coming ? "
63324	63335	63317	63317	She	31	" No thanks . I have n't got spare clothes . "
63336	63352	63353	63353	She	31	" Do n't worry about that . The sun will dry us off quick enough . "
63572	63579	63580	63580	she	31	" I do n't think so , "
63586	63591	63580	63580	she	31	" People will see . "
63592	63598	63599	63599	He	32	" So ? Come on . "
63605	63609	63599	63599	He	32	" Jump in . "
63615	63619	63610	63610	She	31	" Why not ? "
63620	63629	63630	63630	He	32	" I think the question should be why ? "
63633	63641	63642	63642	He	32	" Just for the hell of it . "
63667	63685	63658	63658	Maddie	31	" Come on , Maddie , do n't think so much about it , just do it . "
63846	63852	63816	63816	He	32	" Stop it , Sam . "
63899	63913	63892	63892	He	32	" What 's wrong , Maddie ? Why are you being such a — "
63914	63917	63892	63892	He	32	" Nerd ? "
63918	63925	63926	63926	He	32	" I was going to say — "
64042	64054	64055	64055	she	31	" You 're lucky I do n't know who you are , "
64060	64069	64070	64070	Sam	32	" or I 'd be calling your mothers . "
64073	64095	64070	64070	Sam	32	" I 'm glad I did n't do it . I would n't want you telling on me to my mother . "
64152	64162	64163	64163	Sam	32	" I think we should go back to shore . "
64168	64172	64173	64173	He	32	" Not yet . "
64181	64196	64173	64173	He	32	" You might want to place this over your lap until you dry off . "
64246	64268	64231	64231	She	31	" Fine , we 'll paddle around here for a while . But I am not doing any of the work . "
64978	64984	64973	64973	He	32	" Maddie ? You okay ? "
65101	65106	65107	65107	she	31	" I 'm fine , "
65133	65140	65129	65129	her	31	" I 'm sorry , Maddie . "
65202	65209	65210	65210	he	32	" I 'll take you home , "
65297	65302	65303	65303	she	31	" See you round , "
65343	65358	65333	65333	She	31	" Oh , Sam , are you all right ? I 'm so sorry . "
65359	65370	65371	65371	She	31	" It 'll be better if you let me in . "
65381	65401	65371	65371	She	31	" Look , it was a nice day . Sort of . Let 's just leave it at that . "
65434	65437	65438	65438	She	31	" Why ? "
65441	65456	65438	65438	She	31	" We 're not compatible . I do n't think this will work out . "
65462	65468	65457	65457	He	32	" Why the hell not ? "
65510	65518	65519	65519	Sam	32	" Hey , Pete , tell me , "
65528	65553	65519	65519	Sam	32	" when a woman slams her door in your face after a date , does it mean she never wants to see you again ? "
65554	65559	65560	65560	Pete	38	" Not with Linda , "
65565	65573	65560	65560	Pete	38	" That 's her idea of foreplay . "
65593	65601	65590	65590	Pete	38	" Are we talking about Maddie here ? "
65602	65612	65590	65590	Pete	38	" Yeah . I think I hurt her feelings . "
65613	65619	65590	65590	Pete	38	" What did you say ? "
65620	65639	65640	65640	Pete	38	" Nothing ! I think . We went down to the river and she kind of fell in . "
65675	65679	65680	65680	Sam	32	" You okay ? "
65701	65708	65698	65698	he	32	" Did you push her in ? "
65709	65712	65698	65698	he	32	" No ! "
65718	65738	65698	65698	he	32	" Maybe she had PMS . Whenever Linda gets cranky I know it 's that time of the month . "
65745	65764	65739	65739	Sam	32	" Maybe . Or maybe I said something to upset her , but I ca n't remember what . "
65765	65791	65792	65792	He	32	" That 's possible . I 'm always saying things to Linda that upset her but I never know it until she yells at me . "
65799	65835	65792	65792	He	32	" Half the time I still do n't know what I did wrong even after she explains it to me . I find a kiss and telling her I love her makes everything okay again . "
65836	65855	65739	65739	Sam	32	" That 's not going to work on Maddie yet . What do you think I should do ? "
65856	65880	65739	65739	Sam	32	" You 're asking me ? Jeez , Sam , you 're the one with all the experience when it comes to women . "
65881	65955	65792	65792	He	32	" But you 're the married one , so you must have done something right along the way . None of my relationships have lasted longer than a year . I 'm good at pulling them , it 's the keeping them that gives me a headache . And Maddie 's not like any woman I 've ever known , so I do n't think all my old techniques will work on her . "
65956	66024	65739	65739	Sam	32	" True . She 's one of a kind that girl . Do n't get me wrong , I love my sister - in - law , she 's a great girl , but thank God I fell in love with Linda and not Maddie . My wife might have a temper and be a little crazy at times , but she 's a lot more predictable . "
66025	66035	66036	66036	Pete	38	" Do n't let her hear you say that . "
66061	66071	66072	66072	he	32	" How about a drink back at your place ? "
66075	66079	66080	66080	Pete	38	" Good idea . "
66090	66102	66080	66080	Pete	38	" So you think I should talk to her ? Apologize ? "
66103	66111	66112	66112	Sam	32	" Maybe you should just leave it . "
66124	66132	66133	66133	Pete	38	" Nope , ca n't do that . "
66139	66168	66133	66133	Pete	38	" You got it that bad , huh ? In that case , I think you should talk to her , and apologize . Saying sorry never hurts . "
66169	66181	66133	66133	Pete	38	" But I do n't know what I 'm apologizing for . "
66182	66187	66188	66188	He	38	" Does n't matter . "
66214	66221	66222	66222	Maddie	31	" I 'm joining a convent . "
66316	66325	66327	66327	Linda	60	" Can you wait till after Wednesday night ? "
66335	66341	66327	66327	Linda	60	" I need a babysitter . "
66342	66353	66327	66327	Linda	60	" Sure thing . What are spinster aunts for anyway ? "
66354	66377	66378	66378	Maddie	31	" You 're not a spinster yet . You do n't achieve that status until you 're at least thirty - five . "
66388	66395	66378	66378	Maddie	31	" Life sucks . Men suck . "
66396	66399	66401	66401	Emily	36	" Mummy , "
66408	66415	66401	66401	Emily	36	" what ith Auntie Mad doing ? "
66416	66437	66438	66438	Emily	36	" She 's having a nervous breakdown , honey . It 's nothing to worry about . Go and play . "
66464	66475	66447	66447	David	35	" Do you think I 'm having a nervous breakdown ? "
66504	66507	66509	66509	Linda	60	" Possibly , "
66511	66526	66509	66509	Linda	60	" but I would n't worry too much yet . Wait till after Wednesday . "
66531	66540	66527	66527	Maddie	31	" Nice to know I 'm still loved . "
66541	66544	66545	66545	Linda	60	" Maddie , "
66552	66563	66545	66545	Linda	60	" stop being so melodramatic . You dumped Sam remember . "
66564	66590	66591	66591	She	60	" I did n't dump him . You have to be dating someone to dump them . We were n't dating , we were just ... "
66620	66659	66613	66613	Linda	60	" Oh my God ! You slept with him ! Oh my God ! I want details . I want to know everything . What were you wearing ? Where did it happen ? How big is it ? "
66677	66684	66685	66685	she	60	" I bet it 's huge , "
66688	66708	66685	66685	she	60	" Dotty McQueen says it 's the best she 's ever seen , and she 's seen a few . "
66718	66737	66709	66709	Maddie	31	" Too much information . And before you burst a vein , I did n't sleep with Sam . "
66738	66741	66742	66742	Linda	60	" Oh . "
66750	66754	66742	66742	Linda	60	" Oral sex ? "
66760	66764	66757	66757	her	31	" Phone sex ? "
66765	66778	66709	66709	Maddie	31	" No . I did n't even see him naked . Okay ? "
66779	66782	66783	66783	Linda	60	" No . "
66786	66802	66783	66783	Linda	60	" Not okay . I 'm disappointed in you . You got my hopes up . "
66881	66894	66895	66895	Maddie	31	" Well , I did see him naked from the waist up , "
66898	66918	66895	66895	Maddie	31	" Oh my God ! What was his body like ? I bet he 's got a fantastic chest . "
66919	66926	66927	66927	Maddie	31	" Hmmm , he sure has . "
66937	66956	66929	66929	her	31	" His skin 's tanned and smooth , and there 's a small scar on his left shoulder . "
66957	66960	66961	66961	Linda	60	" Sexy , "
66972	66979	66967	66967	Maddie	31	" Is it hot in here ? "
66980	66983	66984	66984	Linda	60	" Yeah . "
66987	67002	66984	66984	Linda	60	" Lucky you did n't have sex or this room would be on fire . "
67010	67020	67022	67022	Linda	60	" I know you do n't like me prying , "
67024	67027	67028	67028	Maddie	31	" but — "
67030	67043	67044	67044	Maddie	31	" Why are n't you still seeing him ? What went wrong ? "
67152	67160	67161	67161	she	31	" He thinks I 'm a nerd , "
67212	67218	67209	67209	Linda	60	" You are a nerd . "
67283	67310	67262	67262	Linda	60	" But I do n't want Sam thinking I 'm a nerd . Calling each other names is not a healthy way to begin a relationship . "
67311	67319	67320	67320	Maddie	31	" Unless that name is Sweet Cheeks . "
67328	67340	67320	67320	Maddie	31	" I do n't want to know what Pete calls you . "
67341	67353	67262	67262	Linda	60	" It 's not . It 's what I call him . "
67354	67357	67358	67358	Linda	60	" Eeew . "
67371	67401	67402	67402	Maddie	31	" Kidding aside , tell me what he said , Mad . We need to get to the bottom of this before , um , Ronan 's nap time . "
67477	67499	67474	67474	Linda	60	" So that 's why Pete and Sam used to bump us off the boats . I always wondered about that . "
67506	67529	67474	67474	Linda	60	" Now I know why Mary Ellen got so many dates . I thought it was because she had a swimming pool . "
67530	67545	67546	67546	Linda	60	" Linda ! Forget about Mary Ellen and tell me what I should do . "
67555	67558	67559	67559	she	60	" Okay , "
67562	67582	67559	67559	she	60	" so you broke up because he sort of called you a nerd — which he did n't really . "
67590	67593	67588	67588	Semantics	130	" Well ? "
67594	67616	67617	67617	She	60	" I love you , Maddie , because you 're my sister , but you fit the Aunt Mad title perfectly . "
67641	67660	67635	67635	her	60	" You just dumped Sam Hennessy because you think he called you a nerd . You 're insane ! "
67693	67745	67680	67680	she	31	" It 's not just that . It 's the tip of the iceberg . Sam has never looked at me like , you know , he wanted me . Until the other day . All those years and he barely even spoke to me except to call me a nerd . "
67746	67758	67675	67675	Linda	60	" He did that once , Maddie , do n't exaggerate . "
67759	67830	67680	67680	she	31	" Fine , it was only once , but that 's enough . It just proves that we 're entirely different people . I 'm a nerd and he 's Sam Hennessy for God ’s sake . He 's the bad boy and I 'm the good girl . He should n't be attracted to me . Then or now . I have n't changed that much in fifteen years . "
67831	67872	67675	67675	Linda	60	" You 're right , he is Sam Hennessy , bad boy , so make the most of it . To hell with what might or might not happen later . Nothing you 've said so far is convincing me . "
67873	67888	67680	67680	she	31	" Then maybe this will . He only likes me now because of Pheramour . "
67889	67898	67899	67899	Maddie	31	" The love potion you 're working on ? "
67902	67923	67899	67899	Maddie	31	" I tried it on myself before he came over Friday night , then again yesterday morning . It worked . "
67924	67927	67928	67928	Linda	60	" Crap . "
67943	67965	67935	67935	her	60	" You were n't wearing any on Thursday night , and he liked you enough then to visit you on Friday . "
67966	68003	67899	67899	Maddie	31	" You sent him round on a stupid errand . And thanks for the shoes , by the way , but next time deodorize anything you 've worn on your feet before you give them back . "
68004	68020	67899	67899	Maddie	31	" Sam would n't have taken the shoes to you if he was n't interested . "
68021	68042	67935	67935	her	60	" He 's too polite to say no . Besides , he was n't really that interested until Friday night . "
68043	68050	68051	68051	She	60	" What happened on Friday night ? "
68055	68069	68051	68051	She	60	" Did he kiss you ? Was it good ? I want details . "
68070	68083	68084	68084	Linda	60	" Linda ! I 'm having a nervous breakdown . Be supportive . "
68087	68100	68084	68084	Linda	60	" So you think Pheramour is the reason for his sudden interest ? "
