9599	9607	9589	9589	She	141	“ Let ’s have a root canal . ”
9724	9730	9731	9731	he	570	“ We are all set , ”
9804	9815	9816	9816	he	570	“ Did Nate hit the Scotch during the third period ? ”
9838	9846	9830	9830	he	637	“ No , he kept the faith . ”
9847	9855	9879	9879	She	141	“ Bet he ’s drinkin ’ now . ”
9856	9872	9830	9830	he	637	“ Maybe . But Nate does n’t panic . He ’s enjoying himself this week . ”
9893	9908	9879	9879	She	141	“ So are you , like , doing two jobs while Becca is out ? ”
9912	9928	9929	9929	she	141	“ There have n’t been many fires to put out in Midtown . So far , ”
9932	9936	9929	9929	she	141	“ Knock wood . ”
10140	10148	10149	10149	he	570	“ Can I buy you a drink ? ”
10153	10159	10149	10149	he	570	“ We should catch up . ”
10189	10197	10198	10198	she	141	“ It ’s not a good idea , ”
10202	10208	10209	10209	she	141	“ People remember . . . ”
10214	10219	10209	10209	she	141	“ They ’ll talk . ”
10293	10303	10304	10304	she	141	“ Bus to the airport leaves at six thirty , ”
10313	10319	10304	10304	she	141	“ Do n’t be late . ”
10320	10324	10304	10304	she	141	“ All right . ”
10369	10374	10394	10394	She	141	“ Heyyyy , Beak ! ”
10375	10380	10394	10394	She	141	“ Get over here ! ”
10383	10393	10394	10394	She	141	“ Hey , it ’s Lauren ! No way . ”

10459	10467	10453	10453	his	134	“ You and she patching things up ? ”
10468	10475	10476	10476	He	570	“ Does it look like it ? ”
10483	10489	10476	10476	He	570	“ What are we drinking ? ”
11188	11201	11173	11173	Beacon	143	“ Crazy bitch ! Did n’t know how good she had it . ”
11202	11213	11214	11214	His	143	“ The tennis pro ? There ’s a fucking cliché . ”
11389	11406	11407	11407	someone	673	“ Twenty bucks says the tennis pro will drop her by the end of the month , ”
11567	11572	11573	11573	she	141	“ Just a second ! ”
11710	11713	11714	11714	he	143	“ Hi , ”
11750	11754	11740	11740	her	141	“ You okay ? ”
11758	11767	11740	11740	her	141	“ Yeah . It is what it is . ”
11787	11803	11804	11804	She	141	“ I , uh , if you ’re studying , we can talk another time . ”
11822	11829	11804	11804	She	141	“ No . It ’s okay . ”
11838	11845	11846	11846	she	141	“ Have n’t seen you around , ”
11850	11856	11846	11846	she	141	“ Sorry for your troubles . ”
11857	11870	11830	11830	Her	141	“ I suppose I ’m this month ’s gossip at the office . ”
11871	11874	11875	11875	She	141	“ Yeah . ”
11881	11904	11875	11875	She	141	“ They live for this stuff . But only until the next juicy disaster comes along . And there ’s always something . ”
12066	12069	12070	12070	she	141	“ Michael , ”
12073	12078	12070	12070	she	141	“ Hey , now . ”
12095	12100	12092	12092	her	141	“ Want a beer ? ”
12101	12106	12107	12107	he	143	“ Am I breathing ? ”
12173	12178	12179	12179	she	141	“ Have a seat , ”
12301	12309	12310	12310	she	141	“ It ’s that color of blue , ”
12315	12327	12310	12310	she	141	“ I ’ve never seen it anywhere but on a hydrangea . ”
12399	12403	12404	12404	he	143	“ Nice place , ”
12513	12523	12530	12530	his	168	“ Get off your ass and make it happen , ”
12620	12624	12625	12625	he	168	“ Thank you , ”
12748	12773	12774	12774	She	141	“ I feel like I ’m house - sitting , you know ? Maybe it wo n’t be so weird once we start traveling . ”
12852	12857	12858	12858	he	168	“ You were studying , ”
12872	12877	12858	12858	he	168	“ I should go . ”
12878	12881	12882	12882	she	141	“ Okay , ”
12886	12894	12882	12882	she	141	“ Just . . . leave it . ”
12909	12912	12904	12904	she	141	“ Thanks , ”
12964	12972	12952	12952	She	141	“ I ’ll see you at work . ”
12973	12976	12952	12952	She	141	“ Right . ”
12998	13007	12992	12992	She	141	“ Sit down , just for another minute . ”
13013	13028	12992	12992	She	141	“ Are you really okay ? Would you tell me if you were n’t ? ”
13029	13032	13033	13033	His	168	“ Yeah . ”
13062	13065	13066	13066	she	141	“ Okay , ”
13069	13084	13066	13066	she	141	“ I worry about you . I hope you ’re taking care of yourself . ”
13326	13329	13330	13330	he	168	“ Lo , ”
13333	13336	13330	13330	he	168	“ Hey . ”
13342	13347	13348	13348	She	141	“ Look at me . ”
13454	13457	13458	13458	she	141	“ Fuck , ”
13525	13528	13529	13529	she	141	“ Mike , ”
13942	13945	13948	13948	himself	168	“ Fuck , ”
14249	14255	14256	14256	he	168	“ Need you so bad , ”
14284	14287	14288	14288	she	141	“ Mike , ”
14502	14505	14506	14506	he	168	“ Lo , ”
14513	14518	14506	14506	he	168	“ Look at me . ”
14534	14537	14538	14538	he	168	“ Hey , ”
14541	14616	14538	14538	he	168	“ There ’s two things that could happen now . The first one is I go home and spend the next year trying not to remember this happened , or how happy it made me . I ’ll do that if you really want me to . The second choice is that I carry you to your shower for a rinse down , and then we do it several more times in your bed . ”
14633	14640	14641	14641	he	168	“ Do n’t freak , honey , ”
14644	14658	14641	14641	he	168	“ This was n’t an accident or a fluke . It was inevitable . ”
14659	14663	14538	14538	he	168	“ I know . ”
14664	14672	14538	14538	he	168	“ So why do you look sad ? ”
14673	14687	14641	14641	he	168	“ I ’m not the least bit sad . I ’m just astonished . ”
14688	14696	14538	14538	he	168	“ Why ? Because it was good ? ”
14697	14718	14538	14538	he	168	“ No . That it finally happened , and it was just as amazing as I knew it would be . ”
14719	14727	14728	14728	Her	141	“ That ’s because I love you . ”
14733	14736	14728	14728	Her	141	“ Mike . ”
14737	14765	14538	14538	he	168	“ What ? I ca n’t say that ? Like it is n’t fucking obvious ? There ’s probably nobody in your office who does n’t know . ”
14770	14779	14766	14766	Lauren	141	“ The gossip is going to be awful . ”
14780	14788	14789	14789	She	141	“ Maybe . But do we care ? ”
14806	14820	14789	14789	She	141	“ I might not even notice , so long as I have you . ”
14821	14824	14825	14825	He	168	“ Mmm . ”
14842	14848	14825	14825	He	168	“ Good answer , Lo . ”
14868	14876	14877	14877	he	168	“ I ’m not going home tonight , ”
14880	14895	14877	14877	he	168	“ I want to lie in your bed and taste every inch of you . ”
14921	14942	14909	14909	He	168	“ Would this be a horrible time to ask if you ’re , uh , on the pill or something ? ”
14956	14964	14909	14909	He	168	“ Lucky for you , I am . ”
14965	14970	14971	14971	He	168	“ Good to know . ”
14988	15007	15014	15014	she	141	“ Obviously I ’m a shoot - first - and - ask - questions - later kinda guy . ”
15008	15013	15014	15014	she	141	“ I noticed that , ”
15272	15277	15269	15269	Lauren	141	“ Are you Silas ? ”
15278	15283	15284	15285	the kid	2891	“ That ’s me , ”
15296	15299	15284	15285	the kid	2891	“ Dude ! ”
15300	15303	15284	15285	the kid	2891	“ Silas ! ”
15304	15310	15284	15285	the kid	2891	“ Long time no see ! ”
15380	15387	15388	15388	she	141	“ Silas , I ’m Lauren , ”
15398	15410	15388	15388	she	141	“ I ’m filling in for Becca while she ’s out . ”
15411	15419	15420	15420	he	2891	“ Nice to meet you , Lauren , ”
15441	15448	15449	15449	she	141	“ Here is your team ID , ”
15466	15496	15449	15449	she	141	“ And your boarding pass . If you have any questions , you ’ll find me in your Katt Phone under Lauren . And welcome back to the Bruisers . ”
15497	15503	15504	15504	he	2891	“ Thank you , miss , ”
15511	15519	15504	15504	he	2891	“ It ’s good to be back . ”
15918	15934	15935	15935	Elsa	151	“ . . . To a dance party with my friends from my old school , ”
15939	15957	15935	15935	Elsa	151	“ Hans is driving me out to Long Island . It ’s my BFF ’s birthday today . ”
15958	15964	15967	15967	his	134	“ Well you look amazing , ”
15972	15994	15995	15995	Elsa	151	“ Do n’t dance with any boys or your dad will have to fly back from D.C. and knock some heads . ”
16046	16052	16034	16034	Mike	143	“ Be good for Hans . ”
16053	16060	16062	16062	her	513	“ Do n’t blow game five , ”
16290	16297	16298	16298	she	151	“ What ’s she doing here ? ”
16337	16342	16343	16343	he	143	“ Elsa , Jesus , ”
16509	16515	16516	16516	he	134	“ Can I take that ? ”
16519	16522	16523	16523	she	141	“ What ? ”
16549	16559	16560	16560	she	141	“ Oh . Yes . Please . Thank you , ”
17072	17427	17069	17069	He	875	” , dark brown hair , 187 pounds . His father had been treated for prostate cancer , but there were no other significant medical issues in the family . Her gaze lingered on that baby picture . A science nerd who liked music — that was appealing . The process was oddly like reading profiles on a dating site . No matter how cute he ’d been as a toddler , donor 87455 was a real , flawed person out in the world somewhere . He might be charming and kind . Then again , he might have an irritating laugh and a mean streak . Did it matter , though ? If she had a baby , it would be the two of them against the world . She squinted down at the smiling boy on the page , imagining what a blend of her genes and his would look like . She turned the page and read the next profile again . She ’d narrowed it down to these five finalists , out of the thousands on the sperm bank ’s website . Once she made a decision , the winning sperm would be FedExed to her doctor in time for her ovulation date . Each vial of sperm cost a whopping $ 600 , and the insemination procedure itself would set her back more than a thousand more . Luckily , the Kattenberger corporation had excellent health benefits , including fertility coverage . During the open enrollment period last fall , she ’d switched to the Platinum plan specifically with this strategy in mind . A shadow fell over her page . Lauren slammed the folder shut and glared in the direction of whoever had disturbed her . Of course her visitor turned out to be Mike Beacon , who did n’t seem to take notice of her obvious wish to be left alone . The jerk even lifted up the satchel she ’d left guarding the empty seat and tucked it under the chair in front of him , sitting down beside her . Damn . It . All . “
17430	17482	17483	17483	Lauren	141	” he said quietly . Lauren spread her hand onto the cover of the folder and stared down at her shiny fingernails . If she had a child in a year or so , weekly manicures would have to fall by the wayside . But she was ready for a change . “
17485	17493	17483	17483	Lauren	141	” he said , his voice rough . “
17519	17520	17509	17509	I	0	” “
17524	17529	17509	17509	I	0	” she said quickly . “
17534	17535	17536	17536	Lauren	141	” “
17538	17579	17536	17536	Lauren	141	” he whispered . The sound of her name on his lips scraped her insides raw . And when she lifted her chin to meet his dark eyes , she got a little trapped in the warmth she found there . “
17582	17596	17509	17509	I	0	” she said a little sharply , if only to break the spell . “
17618	17619	17602	17602	You	0	” “
17622	17659	17602	17602	You	0	” She should n’t pick a fight with him . That way lay the abyss . But could he really be so clueless ? He blinked , and the light in his eyes dimmed a little . “
17672	17673	17666	17666	her	880	” “
17676	17681	17666	17666	her	880	” Lauren said slowly . “
17725	17731	17721	17721	they	646	” His rugged brow furrowed . “
17735	17736	17721	17721	they	646	” “
17740	17761	17721	17721	they	646	” She knew she should just let this go . But discomfort had churned in her gut for weeks now . “
17769	17782	17721	17721	they	646	room”—that ’s where the wives and families wait for the players after the game—“to
17803	17804	17798	17798	they	883	” “
17807	17812	17798	17798	they	883	” Why . Jesus . “
17836	17842	17826	17834	the evil bitch who nearly wrecked your fairy tale	885	” Mike ’s jaw dropped . “
17855	17856	17848	17848	you	0	” “
17859	17863	17864	17864	They	883	” she hissed . “
17927	17933	17901	17903	My own father	891	” He gaped at her . “
17949	17950	17940	17940	He	891	” “
17959	17973	17954	17954	you	886	” she snapped , realizing with horror that she was about to cry . “
18005	18016	18018	18024	the only one who really harmed me	895	Because”—She gulped back her tears and looked him straight in the eye—“who
18026	18040	18041	18041	I	0	” She knew her point hit home because his face went absolutely pale . “
18044	18045	18041	18041	I	0	” “
18065	18095	18053	18053	I	0	” Now her eyes were stinging and her throat was closing up . Lauren stood up in a hurry , but his giant body was in the freaking way . “
18104	18206	18097	18097	you	894	” she whispered hoarsely . He leaped out of the seat and into the aisle . Without another glance at him Lauren exited the row and darted forward , into the bathroom at the front of the plane . It was — thank the sweet heavens — unoccupied . The moment the door clicked close , the tears came like a fountain . She yanked a paper towel from the holder and pressed it forcefully to her mouth . Alone at last , Lauren clung one - handed to the grab bar and cried absolutely silently in the charter jet ’s bathroom .
18208	18224	18225	18226	Patrick O’Doul	134	“ Beak — what the fuck , man ? It ’s only an hour flight , ”
18229	18234	18225	18226	Patrick O’Doul	134	“ Sit still already . ”
18261	18271	18253	18253	He	143	“ I do n’t know if Lauren is okay . ”
18272	18293	18346	18346	O’Doul	134	“ Yeah ? I ’m sure hanging around the team is hard for her . It would have to be . ”
18294	18298	18299	18299	Mike	143	“ Not necessarily , ”
18302	18345	18299	18299	Mike	143	“ If she found a great guy and had a happy life , it would n’t be hard at all . It ’s been two years , right ? By now I should just be some hockey punk she used to date . ”
18357	18367	18299	18299	Mike	143	“ Maybe . But can I ask you something ? ”
18368	18371	18439	18439	O’Doul	134	“ What ? ”
18372	18401	18439	18439	O’Doul	134	“ It ’s been two years , as you point out . When you look at Lauren , do you see just some girl you used to date ? ”
18402	18413	18299	18299	Mike	143	“ No ! No way . She ’s . . . ”
18422	18427	18414	18414	She	897	“ Oh , fuck . ”
18428	18433	18439	18439	O’Doul	134	“ Yeah , exactly . ”
18447	18460	18439	18439	O’Doul	134	“ But , Jesus . I am really not worth the heartache . ”
18464	18481	18439	18439	O’Doul	134	“ You ’re not my type , so it ’s kinda hard for me to say . ”
18482	18489	18490	18490	Mike	143	“ She ’s still so angry , ”
18493	18512	18490	18490	Mike	143	“ Maybe when she ’s not trapped on a jet with me , it ’s easier for her . ”
18566	18573	18574	18574	he	143	“ I fucked up with her , ”
18577	18581	18574	18574	he	143	“ Big time . ”
18582	18585	18586	18586	He	143	“ Today ? ”
18598	18626	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ So you ’re saying you fucked up two years ago , and you ’re just figuring that out now ? And I thought I was dumb . ”
18630	18692	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ You are , but I ’m dumber . I thought we would all be okay , you know ? I did what I had to do , but I handled it badly . I knew she ’d be mad at me , and I could n’t stand to disappoint her . So I sort of went quiet at the end . ”
18700	18706	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ You shut her out ? ”
18707	18710	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ Yeah . ”
18711	18716	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ Women hate that . ”
18717	18734	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ Thanks for the update , captain , seeing as you ’re an expert these days . ”
18738	18746	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ I never broke anyone ’s heart . ”
18747	18752	18627	18627	Mike	143	“ Uh - huh . ”
18790	18798	18799	18800	the captain	900	“ So why ’d you do it ? ”
18803	18820	18799	18800	the captain	900	“ Why did I shut her out ? Panic , my man . Sheer and total . ”
18837	18916	18917	18917	He	143	“ It was two or three months after Kattenberger bought the team . Lauren and I were planning to move into the city together . The lease was coming up on my rental house , and Nate was moving the team to Brooklyn . Then Shelly got her diagnosis in February . It did n’t seem like a big deal at first . Hell , I assumed she had manufactured a little extra drama around the whole thing . ”
18945	18953	18954	18955	his ex	903	“ I have something to tell you , ”
18959	18966	18967	18967	He	143	“ Yeah ? Make it quick . ”
18981	18987	18967	18967	He	143	“ I have . . . ”
19001	19004	18996	18996	he	143	“ What ? ”
19005	19009	19010	19010	she	141	“ Ovarian cancer , ”
19020	19023	19010	19010	she	141	“ What ? ”
19038	19041	19032	19032	she	141	“ cancer . ”
19048	19055	19056	19056	she	141	“ It ’s bad , Mike , ”
19061	19072	19056	19056	she	141	“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen . ”
19126	19142	19115	19115	he	143	“ So , uh , nobody knew how sick Shelly was when I left Lauren . ”
19143	19150	19151	19151	O’Doul	134	“ Except for Lauren , right ? ”
19165	19179	19154	19154	He	134	“ You did n’t tell her Shelly was terminal ? That ’s insane . ”
19180	19210	19115	19115	he	143	“ Is it ? I had to take a wrecking ball to all our plans either way . I did n’t want to make her feel sorry for me . ”
19211	19223	19154	19154	He	134	“ You wanted her to . . . hate you instead ? ”
19226	19270	19154	19154	He	134	“ Not exactly . But I had a choice — I could either be a martyr or an asshole . I thought it would be easier to get over the asshole than the martyr . And I wanted what was best for her . ”
19281	19297	19273	19273	his	134	“ That ’s complicated , man . Makes my head hurt just thinking about it . ”
19298	19308	19154	19154	He	134	“ Yeah ? How do you think mine feels ? ”
19309	19316	19317	19317	He	134	“ I ca n’t even imagine . ”
19503	19512	19484	19484	He	134	“ What are you thinking about , baby ? ”
19513	19516	19517	19517	she	141	“ Spreadsheets , ”
19521	19524	19525	19525	he	134	“ What ? ”
19539	19552	19525	19525	he	134	“ Jesus fuck . Am I slipping ? Spreadsheets , after that ? ”
19559	19569	19553	19553	Her	141	“ Can I explain myself before you get offended ? ”
19570	19575	19576	19576	He	134	“ Go for it . ”
19591	19606	19576	19576	He	134	“ I ’ve been surfing the real estate listings in the city , right ? ”
19607	19610	19553	19553	Her	141	“ Right . ”
19623	19649	19650	19650	He	134	“ Well . After that spectacular welcome I just received , I started wondering about all the fun we could have in our new place . ”
19657	19673	19650	19650	He	134	“ Okay . I like the sound of that . But what about the spreadsheets ? ”
19674	19703	19712	19712	his	134	“ There are two places that look particularly good to me . One of them has a fireplace in the living room , which has some serious potential . ”
19704	19707	19708	19708	he	134	“ Ah , ”
19718	19728	19708	19708	he	134	“ Like , bear skin rug sort of potential ? ”
19729	19747	19748	19748	He	134	“ I ’m not doing it on a dead bear . Maybe a wool rug , though . ”
19770	19780	19759	19759	he	134	“ Okay . Tell me about the other one . ”
19781	19805	19708	19708	he	134	“ The other place has a terrace . That ’s a real luxury for Manhattan . I could even grow a few hydrangeas . ”
19806	19831	19761	19761	his	134	“ Do I get a vote ? Because I ’m going to pick fireplace fucking . We can buy hydrangeas at the flower shop . ”
19832	19840	19759	19759	he	134	“ The terrace has a hot tub . ”
19841	19844	19708	19708	he	134	“ Oh . ”
19845	19848	19849	19849	she	141	“ Oh , ”
19858	19871	19849	19849	she	141	“ I thought you ’d like that . For your weary muscles . ”
19958	19967	19940	19940	He	134	“ So where do the spreadsheets come in ? ”
19968	19983	19984	19984	she	141	“ I ’m building one to help me with the rent versus buy calculation , ”
19987	20027	19984	19984	she	141	“ I need to estimate the tax savings for each property and do a cost / benefit analysis . I still think we might want to rent for a while . Just until things settle down on the team . ”
20028	20036	20037	20037	He	134	“ Oh , it ’ll be fine . ”
20147	20155	20156	20156	he	134	“ Where shall we go for dinner ? ”
20172	20185	20186	20186	He	134	“ I thought you were taking Elsa out to that pizza place ? ”
20233	20265	20231	20231	Lauren	141	“ The pizza is terrible where I ’m headed . Even Elsa thinks so . But she likes to try her hand at that claw game . You know that thing ? ”
20266	20284	20321	20321	He	134	“ Sure . All those stuffies look easy to grab , but you can never do it . ”
20285	20320	20321	20321	He	134	“ Yup . Elsa loves pouring dollars into that sucker . And after a while she ’s like — Daddy , win this ! But I ca n’t . I think it ’s rigged . ”
20331	20351	20321	20321	He	134	“ So I could take you out for a late dinner , after I take Elsa home . Seafood ? ”
20352	20356	20357	20357	She	141	“ Sounds nice . ”
20364	20370	20357	20357	She	141	“ Or I could cook . ”
20371	20386	20321	20321	He	134	“ You do n’t have to . I could grill a couple of steaks . ”
20397	20402	20403	20403	She	141	“ I ’ll cook . ”
20412	20439	20440	20440	He	134	“ Who knows what kind of kitchen our apartment will have ? Might as well take advantage of that monster Wolf range you ’ve got downstairs . ”
20448	20472	20440	20440	He	134	“ We ’re not going to have a shitty kitchen , Lo . I ’m not going to cheap out on our place . ”
20473	20502	20503	20503	she	141	“ Hey — I’m not worried . But I ’ve overheard the wives who have been house - hunting in Brooklyn . They keep complaining about the kitchens , ”
20506	20530	20503	20503	she	141	“ But it ’s not the end of the world . I ’m looking forward to having a dozen restaurants within walking distance . ”
20531	20537	20538	20538	he	134	“ That does sound fun , ”
20549	20580	20538	20538	he	134	“ You and I have more flexibility with finding a place , anyway . The guys keep talking about schools and crap . But we do n’t care about those . ”
20581	20584	20585	20585	She	141	“ True . ”
20611	20638	20587	20587	her	141	“ I meant yet , Lauren . Unless our future child is a prodigy , we do n’t need to do the school shuffle for years . ”
20639	20669	20538	20538	he	134	“ I knew exactly what you meant . I was just thinking what a tough transition it must be for these Long Island moms who are moving to Brooklyn . ”
20670	20679	20680	20680	he	134	“ Not all of them are doing it , ”
20684	20707	20680	20680	he	134	“ Some players will commute from Long Island . Chancy ’s wife said ‘ no way , no how ’ to moving . ”
20708	20721	20722	20722	Lauren	141	“ He ’ll be retired in a couple of years , anyway , ”
20726	20744	20722	20722	Lauren	141	“ Looks like Coach is trying to deepen the bench on the left wing to get ready . ”
20745	20757	20722	20722	Lauren	141	“ Yeah . This kid Castro is gon na be good . ”
20758	20761	20722	20722	Lauren	141	“ Agreed . ”
20814	20821	20822	20822	he	134	“ I have to get up , ”
20830	20834	20835	20835	she	153	“ I know , ”
20846	20854	20855	20855	he	134	“ I love coming home to you , ”
21198	21204	21196	21196	he	134	“ something terrible is happening , ”
21332	21335	21336	21336	she	153	“ Michael , ”
21343	21354	21336	21336	she	153	“ Elsa wo n’t come out . I ’m sorry . ”
21355	21361	21362	21362	He	143	“ What do you mean ? ”
21372	21378	21362	21362	He	143	“ She ’s not ready ? ”
21401	21426	21397	21397	she	153	“ Elsa says she wo n’t go . I ’ve been working on her , but she wo n’t come out of her room . ”
21427	21430	21431	21431	Elsa	151	“ Why ? ”
21453	21462	21466	21466	he	143	“ You could try to talk to her . ”
21675	21678	21679	21679	he	143	“ Elsa ? ”
21683	21690	21679	21679	he	143	“ Sweetie ? Are you sick ? ”
21705	21711	21698	21698	he	143	“ Not me . Mom . ”
21712	21720	21721	21721	He	143	“ Well , I know about that . ”
21748	21756	21757	21757	Elsa	151	“ She throws up all the time , ”
21764	21768	21769	21769	he	143	“ That sucks , ”
21773	21794	21769	21769	he	143	“ You and me can go and have some pizza , and give your mom a few hours to nap . ”
21800	21808	21797	21797	her	151	“ I do n’t want any pizza . ”
21809	21819	21820	21820	he	143	“ But we ’re going to play the claw , ”
21829	21837	21820	21820	he	143	“ Maybe today ’s our lucky day . ”
21851	21867	21842	21842	her	151	“ It never works , Daddy . You know that . We ’ll never win . ”
21906	21916	21917	21917	he	143	“ You wo n’t come out with me today ? ”
21926	21936	21921	21921	She	151	“ I do n’t want to leave Mom alone . ”
21937	21948	21923	21923	her	151	“ Maybe Tad is coming over to keep her company . ”
21949	21953	21954	21954	she	151	“ Tad bailed , ”
21957	21964	21954	21954	she	151	“ He . . . what ? ”
21965	21975	21976	21976	Fuck	187	“ He left and he ’s not coming back . ”
21978	21985	21986	21986	he	143	“ Is Mom sad about that ? ”
21995	22013	21986	21986	he	143	“ She cried and cried . I could hear her when I was trying to fall asleep . ”
22034	22083	22024	22024	He	143	“ You know , things are kind of rough right now . I sure am sorry about that . But I do n’t think Mom wants you to hide in your room feeling sad . You can still have pizza with your dad . And maybe ice cream . ”
22084	22087	22088	22088	she	151	“ Pancakes , ”
22091	22099	22088	22088	she	151	“ I want you to make pancakes . ”
22100	22103	22104	22104	he	143	“ Okay ! ”
22164	22175	22147	22147	He	143	“ Let ’s go fire up Daddy ’s giant stove . ”
22189	22199	22200	22200	Her	151	“ No . You have to make pancakes here . ”
22205	22214	22200	22200	Her	151	“ Here ? Mom might not like that . ”
22220	22243	22244	22244	His	143	“ She does n’t eat anymore . Ever . But if you make pancakes she ’ll eat . I just know it . ”
22254	22262	22263	22263	She	151	“ That ’s why you want pancakes ? ”
22266	22272	22263	22263	She	151	“ It will totally work . ”
22273	22278	22279	22279	He	143	“ Um . . . ”
22287	22309	22279	22279	He	143	“ You go look for pancake mix in the kitchen , okay ? I ’m going to talk to your mom . ”
22588	22591	22592	22592	he	143	“ Hey , ”
22595	22598	22592	22592	he	143	“ Hey . ”
22608	22629	22599	22599	She	153	“ I have a couple of things to tell you . You want the good news or bad news first ? ”
22630	22635	22592	22592	he	143	“ The good news . ”
22642	22662	22592	22592	he	143	“ Divorce papers are done . I got mine from FedEx today , and yours went to the clubhouse . ”
22663	22668	22599	22599	She	153	“ Wow . Okay . ”
22695	22702	22592	22592	he	143	“ What ’s the bad news ? ”
22703	22713	22714	22714	His	143	“ I got some test results from Johns Hopkins . ”
22718	22721	22714	22714	His	143	“ And ? ”
22722	22736	22592	22592	he	143	“ Same as Sloan Kettering , only they put a number on it . ”
22737	22741	22592	22592	he	143	“ A number ? ”
22742	22762	22765	22765	her	153	“ The five year survival rate for this kind of cancer at this stage . It ’s . . . ”
22769	22773	22765	22765	her	153	“ Twelve percent . ”
22884	22890	22891	22891	he	143	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
22895	22900	22901	22901	she	153	“ Me , too , ”
22950	22957	22958	22958	Shelly	153	“ Take Elsa away in June , ”
22962	22965	22966	22966	he	143	“ What ? ”
22972	22975	22966	22966	he	143	“ Where ? ”
22976	23045	22958	22958	Shelly	153	“ Does n’t matter . Ontario . Disney World . Take her on vacation . I ca n’t do it right now . Too many treatments . And there will be more specialists . She ’ll end up just going to day camp if she stays here with me . I ’ll have to get my parents to move in with me to get her back and forth . ”
23103	23110	23111	23111	he	143	“ I ’ll think of something , ”
23147	23153	23154	23154	Shelly	153	“ We ’ll talk tomorrow , ”
23158	23164	23154	23154	Shelly	153	“ Or the next day . ”
23165	23168	23174	23174	her	153	“ Okay , ”
23629	23638	23639	23639	Lauren	141	“ God , this is a total gongshow , ”
23755	23757	23750	23751	her father	375	“ Zamboni ”
23778	23782	23783	23783	Her	141	“ hip check . ”
23942	23947	23948	23948	Lauren	141	“ Is something wrong ? ”
24042	24045	24026	24026	He	143	“ Lauren . ”
24059	24080	24046	24046	His	143	“ Hi ! I ’m still on the train . But I should make it to your house in thirty . ”
24096	24102	24103	24103	he	143	“ I ’m not there , ”
24107	24117	24103	24103	he	143	“ There ’s something I need to tell you . ”
24128	24135	24103	24103	he	143	“ Baby , what is it ? ”
24136	24141	24142	24142	She	141	“ I . . . ”
24147	24157	24142	24142	She	141	“ I moved back into the old house today . ”
24158	24161	24162	24162	She	141	“ What ? ”
24186	24189	24190	24190	he	143	“ Yeah , ”
24193	24222	24190	24190	he	143	“ I love you . Hell , I ’ve always loved you . But my family needs me right now , and there is n’t any other way . ”
24223	24230	24231	24231	she	141	“ They . . . what ? ”
24235	24257	24231	24231	she	141	“ Mike , you ’re not making a lot of sense . I need to see you . Where are you ? ”
24258	24261	24262	24262	he	143	“ No , ”
24266	24277	24262	24262	he	143	“ My mind is made up . Shelly is sick . ”
24278	24283	24284	24284	Lauren	141	“ She ’s sick ? ”
24290	24305	24287	24288	an idiot	758	“ Yeah . She ’s getting chemotherapy now . Elsa is all freaked out . ”
24306	24309	24262	24262	he	143	“ Oh . ”
24346	24351	24352	24352	he	143	“ I ’m sorry , ”
24355	24371	24352	24352	he	143	“ This is gon na be so hard , but I have to do it . ”
24372	24379	24380	24380	she	141	“ You do n’t , though , ”
24383	24392	24380	24380	she	141	“ We could change our plans . . . ”
24414	24426	24393	24393	His	143	“ I ’m sorry , baby . I ’m so sorry . ”
24682	24685	24686	24686	Nate	133	“ YEAH ! ”
24774	24782	24767	24771	Lauren ’s inner hockey fan	1027	“ No penalty ? That ’s bullshit ! ”
24959	24965	24966	24966	Nate	133	“ It might be nothing , ”
24969	24992	24966	24966	Nate	133	“ He probably wants to hear the penalty called , and give his guys a moment to breathe before they restart play . ”
25030	25033	25034	25034	Nate	133	“ Lauren . ”
25039	25042	25034	25034	Nate	133	“ Breathe . ”
25092	25097	25083	25083	Nathan	133	“ There he goes . ”
25145	25148	25149	25149	she	141	“ Nathan , ”
25156	25162	25149	25149	she	141	“ Why am I here ? ”
25163	25171	25172	25172	he	143	“ Because the team needs your help , ”
25176	25190	25149	25149	she	141	“ And two years is a long time to miss out on hockey . ”
25191	25199	25200	25200	she	141	“ I was just fine without hockey , ”
25218	25231	25204	25204	Nathan	133	“ No matter how often you say otherwise , you love hockey . ”
25234	25260	25261	25261	His	143	“ Please tell me I ’m not here right now because you were staging some kind of intervention . That ’s fucked up , Nathan . ”
25281	25298	25261	25261	His	143	“ It would be more convenient if you were afraid of me like everyone else is . ”
25299	25305	25306	25306	He	143	“ Good luck with that . ”
25309	25317	25306	25306	He	143	“ Your boy is back in action . ”
25318	25325	25326	25326	Nathan	133	“ He ’s not my boy . ”
26026	26042	26048	26048	his	1067	“ Michael — that was quite the athletic save you made during the first period , ”
26058	26081	26084	26084	him	143	“ Great work getting your glove into that corner ! What was going through your head while you dove for that puck ? ”
26096	26148	26092	26092	his	143	“ Honestly ? A few different four - letter words . I know the highlight - reel saves make for good video , but that kind of save only happens if I ’ve read the scene wrong in the first place , and have to make a quick and desperate correction . ”
26149	26153	26155	26156	the announcer	1070	“ Got it , ”
26162	26179	26155	26156	the announcer	1070	“ Nicely done , then . Good save , as they say ! Heh - heh . ”
26260	26280	26288	26288	him	303	“ Did you reach Rebecca ? I need to make sure she knows about her doctor ’s appointment tomorrow . ”
26281	26285	26286	26286	Lauren	141	“ I tried , ”
26290	26316	26286	26286	Lauren	141	“ But she did n’t answer her phone . I did n’t think you ’d want me to keep trying . It ’s almost eleven . ”
26320	26325	26317	26317	Nate	133	“ Call my landline . ”
26326	26331	26332	26332	Lauren	141	“ Your . . . ”
26336	26340	26332	26332	Lauren	141	“ At home ? ”
26347	26369	26341	26341	He	303	“ She ’s staying with . . . at my place for a little while . It ’s more peaceful there . ”
26375	26382	26383	26383	she	141	“ I ’ll try your landline , ”
26392	26406	26383	26383	she	141	“ But , Nate ? Why did n’t you just call her yourself ? ”
26432	26444	26427	26427	Nate	133	“ Are you too busy right now to make the call ? ”
26445	26450	26451	26451	she	141	“ Not at all , ”
26469	26475	26476	26476	he	303	“ If you reach her , ”
26489	26518	26476	26476	he	303	“ tell her that the car will be there at nine fifteen instead of nine thirty tomorrow morning , because traffic in the Battery Tunnel can be nasty . ”
26519	26524	26525	26525	Lauren	141	“ Yes , sir , ”
26552	26555	26556	26556	Rebecca	211	“ Hello ? ”
26565	26568	26556	26556	Rebecca	211	“ Lauren ? ”
26569	26580	26525	26525	Lauren	141	“ Hi . I ’m sorry to call so late . ”
26581	26645	26556	26556	Rebecca	211	“ It ’s okay . I just did n’t know if I should answer Nate ’s phone . But the caller ID said your name so I figured I was supposed to answer . Did you know there are computer screens in every room of Nate ’s house ? They blink on when you walk past them . I ’m all creeped out . ”
26646	26653	26556	26556	Rebecca	211	“ Why , um . . . ”
26673	26679	26680	26680	Becca	211	“ Why are you there ? ”
26683	26784	26680	26680	Becca	211	“ It ’s weird , right ? But I was n’t doing so well , and I mentioned to Nate that my sister and her idiot boyfriend were back together and making a lot of noise in my apartment . I could n’t sleep and I was all stressed out . Nate showed up the next day with empty suitcases and told me to pack for an extended stay . I have to wonder — is his Manhattan empire crumbling without you at the helm ? Because the man really does n’t want me to take any more sick leave . ”
26836	26841	26842	26842	she	1079	“ I should run , ”
26845	26879	26842	26842	she	1079	“ But Nate needed you to know that a car will pick you up for your doctor ’s appointment at nine fifteen tomorrow , not nine thirty . He ’s worried about traffic . ”
26883	26925	26880	26880	Becca	211	“ He ’s worried I ’ll miss this appointment that he pried out of some neurology genius . The guy was already booked for months . Although I do n’t know what one more doctor will really add to this equation . ”
26926	26932	26933	26933	Lauren	141	“ Well , good luck , ”
26977	26980	26981	26981	Becca	211	“ Night ! ”
26993	27000	26991	26991	Figures	194	“ Tell Nate I said congrats ! ”
27001	27008	27009	27009	She	141	“ I will . Good night ! ”
27216	27225	27226	27226	Nate	133	“ I ’ll stand for the bill tonight , ”
27229	27233	27226	27226	Nate	133	“ Well then . ”
27240	27248	27236	27236	his	134	“ Order the good stuff , boys . ”
27436	27449	27450	27450	He	1115	“ Good evening ! Can I start you off with a drink ? ”
27456	27459	27460	27460	Lauren	141	“ Sure , ”
27463	27488	27460	27460	Lauren	141	“ But do you have a Caesar salad I can order to go ? And I ’ll have a Diet Coke while I wait . ”
27489	27502	27515	27515	He	1115	“ Indeed we do . But the Greek salad is even better . ”
27503	27514	27515	27515	He	1115	“ Good tip . I ’ll take one of those . ”
27569	27572	27573	27573	She	141	“ Lauren . ”
27588	27594	27578	27579	Mike Beacon	143	“ May I sit down ? ”
27600	27607	27578	27579	Mike Beacon	143	“ I ’m not staying long . ”
27608	27611	27612	27612	He	1115	“ Well . ”
27617	27641	27614	27614	his	1115	“ I do n’t want to take up a lot of your time , but there ’s something I needed to tell you . ”
27710	27715	27716	27716	she	141	“ Have a seat , ”
27754	27761	27740	27740	She	141	“ Congratulations on your win tonight . ”
27762	27766	27767	27767	he	1115	“ Thank you , ”
27775	27786	27767	27767	he	1115	“ Felt good to prove we could do it again . ”
27787	27792	27793	27793	He	1115	“ I ’ll bet . ”
27816	27819	27820	27820	he	1115	“ Listen , ”
27823	27835	27820	27820	he	1115	“ You were right . I owe you a huge apology . ”
27844	27847	27848	27848	His	1115	“ Okay ? ”
27858	27869	27848	27848	His	1115	“ Two years ago I made a really hard decision . ”
27876	27920	27848	27848	His	1115	“ But the way I went about it was n’t cool . I ’m sorry I shut you out . You did n’t deserve that treatment from me . I ’m sorry I made you the collateral damage to my lifetime of fuckups . ”
27934	27938	27939	27939	she	141	“ Thank you , ”
28004	28020	28021	28022	the waiter	1120	“ Your salad will be another five minutes . Can I bring you anything else ? ”
28025	28031	28021	28022	the waiter	1120	“ No , thank you . ”
28050	28070	28038	28038	Mike	143	“ I just want you to know how sorry I am . I ’m sorry every day , Lo . ”
28096	28100	28101	28101	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
28104	28133	28134	28134	She	141	“ It was a shock . But more than that , you were n’t honest with me . You did n’t tell me how bad everything really was . ”
28149	28153	28154	28154	he	143	“ I know , ”
28158	28213	28154	28154	he	143	“ I had so much guilt about the unlucky hand that Shelly was dealt . First , she gave up a lot to have my child and marry me . Then she got sicker than anyone her age should ever be . And Elsa was freaking out . She was so scared . . . ”
28239	28268	28231	28231	He	143	“ I thought . . . either I can be happy , or I can be the man they needed me to be . I had to choose . ”
28349	28379	28342	28342	he	143	“ I should have explained everything to you . That was my huge mistake . But I could n’t talk to you about it . I was too afraid . ”
28380	28384	28385	28385	Her	141	“ Of what ? ”
28393	28405	28385	28385	Her	141	“ That I ’d try to talk you out of it ? ”
28406	28416	28474	28474	His	1124	“ Yeah , and that I ’d let you . ”
28424	28444	28385	28385	Her	141	“ My heart was with you , Lo . But I did n’t feel like I had a choice . ”
28445	28448	28385	28385	Her	141	“ Why ? ”
28467	28473	28474	28474	His	1124	“ I made a vow . ”
28482	28489	28474	28474	His	1124	“ Until death do us part . ”
28497	28536	28474	28474	His	1124	“ And that ’s admirable . I get it . But only one of us became Saint Mike . I spent six months wondering what I ’d done so wrong that made you erase me from your life . ”
28554	28598	28548	28548	She	141	“ I read about Shelly ’s health problems in press releases , Mike . I learned she died on Twitter . I do n’t know why you thought you had to throw a grenade at my life in order to make everything right . ”
28602	28613	28614	28614	he	1125	“ I ’m really sorry it went down like that , ”
28618	28631	28614	28614	he	1125	“ I owed you an explanation , and you never got one . ”
28676	28687	28688	28688	he	1125	“ I will always regret the way I handled things , ”
28691	28698	28688	28688	he	1125	“ You said you . . . ”
28712	28726	28704	28704	She	141	“ The betrayal really stung . I have n’t really trusted anyone since . ”
28757	28764	28765	28765	He	1125	“ I ’m sorry , Lo . ”
28779	28787	28765	28765	He	1125	“ I made a mess of everything . ”
28788	28793	28794	28794	she	141	“ Elsa probably disagrees , ”
28819	28871	28816	28816	He	1125	“ Elsa ’s had a really hard couple of years . Some days I think she ’s doing okay . But then there are times when we ’ve squared off over something . And she just looks at me like she ca n’t believe the incompetence of her only surviving parent . ”
28906	28909	28910	28910	She	141	“ Here . ”
28916	28919	28920	28920	she	141	“ Thanks , ”
28942	28949	28950	28950	Mike	195	“ I ’ll walk you out , ”
29047	29052	29053	29053	he	195	“ I like cities , ”
29072	29082	29060	29060	He	195	“ I wanted to live in one with you . ”
29083	29086	29087	29087	she	141	“ Michael , ”
29091	29094	29087	29087	she	141	“ What ? ”
29095	29104	29060	29060	He	195	“ You ca n’t say things like that . ”
29105	29111	29112	29112	He	195	“ But it ’s true . ”
29250	29279	29280	29280	He	195	“ What do you want from me , Mike ? You want me to say I forgive you , so you can feel better about the whole thing ? ”
29296	29338	29280	29280	He	195	“ No , honey . I ’ll never feel better . But I was hoping that we could get to a place where I walk into a room and you do n’t feel you need an instant excuse to leave it . ”
29361	29371	29372	29372	she	141	“ It ’s not easy to be around you , ”
29375	29380	29381	29381	He	195	“ Too many memories . ”
29393	29442	29381	29381	He	195	“ Well . If it ’s never going to get any easier , I ’ll have to settle for making sure that we ’re both in agreement that I was an asshole . Hell , I ’ll make a formal announcement over the jet loudspeaker if you want . ”
29443	29446	29447	29447	He	195	“ No ! ”
29450	29506	29447	29447	He	195	“ I would , though . I ’d do anything for you . I mean that . If you need a favor — I want you to remember that I said so . Twenty years from now , if there ’s a spider in your bathroom you can call me to come and kill it . ”
29507	29515	29524	29524	His	195	“ I ’m not afraid of spiders . ”
29516	29523	29524	29524	His	195	“ Okay , a rattlesnake then . ”
29623	29628	29629	29629	she	1135	“ I ca n’t , ”
29662	29665	29666	29666	Ari	180	“ Hi , ”
29683	29686	29666	29666	Ari	180	“ Hi . ”
29696	29718	29719	29719	She	141	“ I was just heading back to the hotel . Want to join me ? The car should be . . . ”
29723	29730	29719	29719	She	141	“ Right there , I think . ”
29746	29751	29752	29752	Georgia	137	“ Uh , sure ? ”
29795	29802	29803	29803	he	195	“ Take care of these ladies , ”
29867	29873	29856	29856	he	195	“ Take care of yourself . ”
29874	29878	29879	29879	He	195	“ I will . ”
29929	29933	29934	29934	she	141	“ Jesus Christ , ”
29937	29946	29947	29947	Georgia	137	“ I hope we did n’t interrupt anything , ”
29951	29954	29955	29955	Lauren	141	“ Nope , ”
29959	29976	29977	29977	Ari	180	“ Patrick told me just last week that you and Beak used to be a thing , ”
29980	29984	29977	29977	Ari	180	“ True story . ”
29988	29992	29985	29985	Lauren	141	“ What happened ? ”
30008	30031	30003	30003	Lauren	141	“ Depends who you ask . He broke up with me over the phone the month we were shopping for apartments together . ”
30032	30035	30036	30036	Georgia	137	“ Ouch , ”
30039	30072	30036	30036	Georgia	137	“ The other side of the story is that his ex - wife was terminally ill . He panicked and went back to her after a year and a half with me . ”
30073	30077	30078	30078	Ari	180	“ Holy shit ! ”
30081	30097	30078	30078	Ari	180	“ I never saw it coming . So I had a rough couple of months . ”
30112	30141	30102	30102	She	141	“ We have n’t talked at all , either . But he wants to be friends again , and I do n’t know if I can do it . ”
30170	30181	30182	30182	Georgia	137	“ So that ’s my life . How are yours ? ”
30185	30220	30182	30182	Georgia	137	“ And here I thought I was a little stressed out about planning a charity benefit in only two days . Compared to your thing I guess it is n’t such a big deal . ”
30221	30225	30226	30226	Ari	180	“ What benefit ? ”
30234	30249	30229	30229	Georgia	137	“ Nate had this bet with a friend from college . Some Florida billionaire . ”
30250	30254	30255	30255	Lauren	141	“ Alex Engels , ”
30258	30273	30255	30255	Lauren	141	“ She owns cable TV networks , real estate , and an NBA team . ”
30274	30277	30278	30278	Georgia	137	“ Right , ”
30281	30383	30278	30278	Georgia	137	“ They had a bet going . Whoever ’s team did n’t make the play - offs had to donate a million dollars to the other guy ’s charity of choice . The Bruisers made it but Alex ’s team did n’t . So she ’s throwing a black - tie cocktail party in forty - eight hours . Whatever she raises she ’ll match on top of her own million . All the players have to go , because this thing is being billed as a way to meet both a hockey team and a basketball team in one night . ”
30384	30391	30392	30392	Ari	180	“ Let me get this straight , ”
30395	30419	30392	30392	Ari	180	“ Nate won a bet . . . so I need to put on a gown and heels ? How is that fair ? ”
30420	30429	30430	30430	Lauren	141	“ You have two days to find one , ”
30434	30454	30430	30430	Lauren	141	“ And an entire team to prepare for the next round of grueling competition . No sweat , right ? ”
30458	30472	30455	30455	Ari	180	“ You ’re funny , Lauren . How do we not know this ? ”
30473	30516	30392	30392	Ari	180	“ Eh . Being around the team makes me cranky . I have to psych myself up just to step into any building where Mike Beacon is . It ’s hard to be funny when you ’re trying not to throw up . ”
30517	30520	30521	30521	Georgia	137	“ Huh , ”
30525	30538	30521	30521	Georgia	137	“ That ’s why you always tell Nate that you hate hockey . ”
30550	30597	30539	30539	Lauren	141	“ I say that just to be a pain . He knows that hockey used to be my life , and that this team was my family . My father was the GM until Nate fired him and promoted Hugh . My boyfriend was the captain . ”
30603	30637	30598	30598	Ari	180	“ I ’d forgotten that Beak was captain . Patrick told me he only got the job because Beacon had some family emergencies . I sure never heard the whole story , though . ”
30644	30659	30640	30640	Lauren	141	“ I guess it ’s nice to know that not everyone is a gossip . ”
30660	30683	30684	30684	Georgia	137	“ I ’ve worked for the team almost since the minute Nate bought it and I never heard about you and Beak , ”
30687	30699	30684	30684	Georgia	137	“ Maybe the gossip was n’t as bad as all that ? ”
30700	30760	30640	30640	Lauren	141	“ Maybe not now . But the hockey wives all knew Shelly because she ’d been their friend for years , and she was well liked . And when she and Mike broke up they all blamed me , even though it was n’t like that . Later , when he left me , they were filled with glee . ”
30761	30764	30766	30766	Georgia	137	“ Yikes , ”
30769	30780	30766	30766	Georgia	137	“ I moved to Manhattan in a big hurry then . ”
30886	30893	30880	30880	Ari	180	“ No — I’ve got it . ”
30894	30899	30880	30880	Ari	180	“ Are you sure ? ”
30900	30922	30923	30923	She	141	“ Of course . It ’s just a few dollars and you two were practically my therapists all the way here . ”
30955	30966	30967	30967	Ari	180	“ Well , I hope it gets a little easier , ”
30976	30982	30983	30983	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
30995	31024	31025	31025	she	141	“ If you have any real issues with finding a dress , call me . Clothes are my hobby . You and I are about the same size , ”
31031	31037	31025	31025	she	141	“ You could borrow something . ”
31066	31084	31085	31085	Ari	180	“ If I ’m in a real bind , I just might take you up on that , ”
31091	31113	31085	31085	Ari	180	“ I have a tightly packed therapy schedule tomorrow . I do n’t see how I could get near a store . ”
31123	31141	31142	31142	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll text you a couple of pictures of dresses tomorrow when I ’m at home , ”
31145	31151	31142	31142	Lauren	141	“ Thank you . Seriously . ”
31158	31185	31152	31152	Ari	180	“ All my dresses are either for work or they look like a club kid ’s wear . Because I used to be a club kid . ”
31186	31193	31194	31194	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll set you up , ”
31214	31220	31207	31207	Ari	180	“ I ’m so relieved . ”
31233	31239	31240	31240	she	141	“ Good night , girls , ”
31252	31262	31240	31240	she	141	“ See you at the butt crack of dawn . ”
31386	31392	31393	31393	Elsa	151	“ You said to repeat ! ”
31399	31404	31405	31405	Hans	155	“ But not there ! ”
31412	31430	31405	31405	Hans	155	“ Go back to measure fifty - five . Let ’s finish this before I ’m old . ”
31851	31860	31861	31861	Shelly	153	“ Hans just broke up with his boyfriend , ”
31866	31896	31861	31861	Shelly	153	“ He ’s homeless . He ’s flying back to Germany to re - group for the summer , and I ’m afraid he ’s going to stay there . ”
31897	31900	31901	31901	Mike	143	“ Fuck , ”
31922	31937	31942	31942	Shelly	153	“ What if he moved in here ? He already babysits for us plenty . ”
31961	31964	31965	31965	Mike	143	“ Okay , ”
31975	31985	31965	31965	Mike	143	“ Should I write him an e - mail ? ”
31986	31990	31991	31991	she	153	“ Do it , ”
32131	32136	32137	32137	he	155	“ Easy , kiddo , ”
32140	32143	32137	32137	he	155	“ Daddy ! ”
32159	32164	32165	32165	She	151	“ You ’re back ! ”
32184	32188	32189	32189	he	155	“ I am , ”
32216	32228	32206	32206	She	151	“ I ’m home for forty - eight hours , anyway . ”
32238	32248	32229	32229	Elsa	151	“ Your next game is n’t for four days . ”
32249	32267	32296	32296	Her	151	“ True . But Nate is shipping us all to some benefit in Miami on Tuesday night . ”
32268	32272	32273	32273	Elsa	151	“ Hell no ! ”
32276	32295	32273	32273	Elsa	151	“ That ’s not cool . I ’m going to tweet that Nate Kattenberger is anti - family . ”
32314	32362	32363	32363	He	143	“ I would n’t do that , honey . Nate is financing our fancy new house and our big trip to France this summer . Besides — as soon as the play - offs are done I ’m going to be around all the time . Seriously . ”
32368	32385	32363	32363	He	143	“ You ’ll be like — Daddy get out of my room ! Get a life ! ”
32394	32401	32402	32402	He	155	“ You sound just like her . ”
32414	32430	32402	32402	He	155	“ Good practice , Elsabelle . Except you race too fast through the B section . ”
32431	32434	32435	32435	she	151	“ Nope ! ”
32438	32443	32435	32435	she	151	“ Your pace drags . ”
32444	32450	32451	32451	Mike	143	“ Be nice , Elsa , ”
32458	32461	32462	32462	Hans	155	“ Eh , ”
32471	32509	32462	32462	Hans	155	“ It ’s like taking a Mercedes on the autobahn and following the speed limit . She ’s the only kid I teach who can play it that fast . I ’d let it rip , too . ”
32520	32548	32510	32510	Mike	143	“ So tonight I was thinking we ’d all watch a movie together . Maybe one of those sappy movies Elsa likes . Then hot fudge sundaes ? ”
32560	32571	32572	32572	he	155	“ You are joking right now , are n’t you ? ”
32588	32591	32592	32592	he	143	“ Go ! ”
32602	32612	32613	32613	he	155	“ Go out and get drunk and . . . ”
32623	32643	32613	32613	he	155	“ I ’m sorry about this thing on Tuesday night in Miami . The hits just keep on coming . ”
32644	32661	32698	32698	him	155	“ It ’s fine . I did n’t have anything I needed to do on Tuesday . ”
32662	32682	32683	32683	Hans	155	“ Yeah ? Well I do n’t think you read the calendar for Tuesday yet . Check your phone . ”
32701	32706	32707	32707	Mike	143	“ Sorry , pal ! ”
32740	32747	32748	32748	Hans	155	“ It has to be Cats ? ”
32755	32779	32748	32748	Hans	155	“ Who does that show anymore ? Will it be rude if I wear my earbuds and listen to Hamilton the whole time ? ”
32780	32789	32790	32790	Elsa	151	“ Then you wo n’t hear me play ! ”
32796	32801	32802	32802	Hans	155	“ Kidding , sweetie ! ”
32805	32810	32811	32811	Mike	143	“ Who ’s hungry ? ”
32820	32826	32811	32811	Mike	143	“ Is it lunch time ? ”
32827	32832	32833	32833	Hans	155	“ Half past ten ? ”
32836	32855	32833	32833	Hans	155	“ That ’s brunch . You can say ‘ brunch . ’ It wo n’t make you gay . ”
32860	32873	32856	32856	Mike	143	“ I love you , man . Does that make me gay ? ”
32874	32880	32881	32881	Elsa	151	“ I love him more ! ”
32978	32984	32985	32985	Elsa	151	“ Can I start it ? ”
32997	33016	32985	32985	Elsa	151	“ In a minute . There ’s a couple of things I need to talk to you about . ”
33017	33020	33021	33021	She	151	“ What ? ”
33030	33038	33023	33023	her	151	“ I found you a math tutor . ”
33044	33047	33039	33039	Elsa	151	“ Yippee . ”
33048	33059	33060	33060	He	143	“ This young woman was recommended by your school counselor . ”
33076	33090	33074	33074	Elsa	151	“ She ’s fun , apparently . You ’re seeing her on Tuesday . ”
33091	33100	33039	33039	Elsa	151	“ Fine . What ’s the other thing ? ”
33121	33140	33141	33141	He	143	“ This came in the mail , and I really do n’t know what to think about it . ”
33197	33204	33205	33205	she	513	“ Where did you get these ? ”
33213	33238	33205	33205	she	513	“ The , uh , lawyer sent them while I was away . He ’d had instructions to hold onto them for a year . ”
33239	33243	33244	33244	Elsa	151	“ A year , ”
33248	33256	33244	33244	Elsa	151	“ Apparently that ’s what she wanted . ”
33337	33345	33346	33346	she	513	“ I ’m not reading it tonight , ”
33358	33361	33362	33362	he	143	“ Okay , ”
33366	33380	33362	33362	he	143	“ That ’s fine . Can you do me a favor , though ? ”
33381	33384	33346	33346	she	513	“ Sure ? ”
33385	33402	33362	33362	he	143	“ Tell me when you have read it ? I ’ll read mine too , then . ”
33403	33407	33408	33408	She	513	“ All right . ”
33417	33422	33408	33408	She	513	“ Yours is thin . ”
33423	33428	33429	33429	He	143	“ I noticed that . ”
33558	33565	33547	33547	She	151	“ Let ’s watch this thing . ”
33794	33800	33801	33801	He	143	“ Good night , honey . ”
33811	33831	33801	33801	He	143	“ Tomorrow I ’ll have training in the morning . But we can go out for dinner together later . “
33832	33841	33801	33801	He	143	“ Okay . Can I pick the place ? ”
33842	33846	33801	33801	He	143	“ Within reason . ”
33847	33854	33801	33801	He	143	“ Did you lock the doors ? ”
33876	33881	33868	33868	She	151	“ I sure did . ”
33882	33890	33801	33801	He	143	“ Hans is n’t coming home tonight ? ”
33891	33898	33899	33899	he	143	“ Does n’t seem like it , ”
33903	33920	33899	33899	he	143	“ Probably crashing at Justin ’s . The trains do n’t run as frequently at night . ”
33926	33935	33921	33921	Elsa	151	“ I know they sleep together , Dad . ”
33991	33994	33980	33980	his	143	“ Daddy ? ”
33995	33998	34021	34021	champ	1221	“ Yeah ? ”
33999	34009	34021	34021	champ	1221	“ Do you think it ’s serious with Justin ? ”
34010	34017	33980	33980	his	143	“ Uh . . . maybe ? ”
34026	34057	34021	34021	champ	1221	“ Hans tells us a lot of funny little stories about the places he and Justin go , but he does n’t really tell us how he feels about him . ”
34058	34063	34064	34064	Elsa	151	“ I noticed that , ”
34073	34097	34064	34064	Elsa	151	“ But Hans would n’t spend so much time with someone unless he cared . I ’m worried that he ’ll leave us . ”
34098	34101	34021	34021	champ	1221	“ Ah . ”
34107	34139	34104	34104	He	1222	“ Hans will leave someday no matter what , right ? But he ’ll always be our friend . You can still have him over for Thai food and orchestra gossip . ”
34140	34143	34144	34144	Elsa	151	“ Mmm , ”
34151	34160	34144	34144	Elsa	151	“ I do n’t want him to go . ”
34161	34206	34104	34104	He	1222	“ Why do n’t we wait until he wants to go to worry about it ? He has a pretty sweet deal here right now . He lives rent free with two people who are pretty great . Who would want to leave us ? ”
34207	34210	34211	34211	She	151	“ True . ”
34217	34228	34211	34211	She	151	“ Hey , Els ? Can I ask a favor ? ”
34229	34232	34104	34104	He	1222	“ Sure . ”
34233	34261	34104	34104	He	1222	“ If you happen to , uh , run into Lauren again before the play - offs are over , can you just give her a smile ? ”
34262	34265	34266	34266	Elsa	151	“ Why ? ”
34277	34285	34286	34286	he	1222	“ Because I ’m asking you to , ”
34290	34319	34286	34286	he	1222	“ It ’s not her choice to work with the team right now . But Nate asked her to step in because Becca is taking a temporary leave . ”
34320	34332	34333	34333	Mike	143	“ Becca is great , but I do n’t like Lauren . ”
34349	34414	34341	34341	one	1223	“ You do n’t really know Lauren , honey . You have n’t seen her for two years . But she and I used to be close , and it ’s important to treat her with respect . Maybe you ’re not a fan of everything that happened when your mother and I were separated . But none of that is Lauren ’s fault . ”
34415	34423	34424	34424	His	143	“ That ’s not what I heard . ”
34430	34433	34424	34424	His	143	“ What ? ”
34434	34463	34341	34341	one	1223	“ Mrs. Chancer said Lauren stole you away from Mom . That she ’s a sneaky little bitch who does n’t know that karma is real . . . ”
34464	34467	34468	34468	he	143	“ Elsa , ”
34523	34530	34533	34533	herself	151	“ That ’s what she said . ”
34535	34539	34533	34533	herself	151	“ And more . ”
34542	34549	34550	34550	he	143	“ Okay , listen to me , ”
34558	34599	34550	34550	he	143	“ None of that is true . Lauren did n’t do a thing wrong . She was in no way responsible for the time that your mother and I spent apart . That was all me and Mom , okay ? ”
34606	34617	34550	34550	he	143	“ Then why did you leave in the first place ? ”
34655	34687	34644	34644	they	1230	“ Your mom and I had some troubles . I know you did n’t like it , but you do n’t get to blame Lauren for it . Or . . . ”
34705	34714	34701	34703	the tennis instructor	2857	“ . . . Tad . Or anyone . ”
34715	34723	34724	34724	He	143	“ I did n’t like Tad either . ”
34734	34787	34788	34788	Elsa	151	“ You do n’t have to like him . But you ca n’t be rude to him , and you ca n’t blame him for what happened . I mean it — be polite to Lauren . She ’s important to me , and she does n’t deserve any scorn from anyone . ”
34791	34796	34788	34788	Elsa	151	“ Okay . Whatever . ”
34967	34978	34979	34979	he	161	“ Is that all of your bags , Miss Lauren ? ”
34983	34991	34979	34979	he	161	“ That ’s all . Thank you . ”
34992	34999	35000	35000	he	161	“ I ’ll grab this one , ”
35017	35020	35021	35021	she	141	“ Thanks , ”
35270	35277	35278	35278	He	477	“ Dad ? Is everything okay ? ”
35283	35297	35278	35278	He	477	“ Your mother was expecting you this weekend for your cousin ’s christening . ”
35342	35348	35349	35349	she	141	“ I ’m in Florida , ”
35353	35373	35349	35349	she	141	“ I told Mom already . There ’s a benefit in Bal Harbour before the series starts in Tampa . ”
35380	35415	35374	35374	He	477	“ What owner parades his players around in tuxes before round two ? They should have noses to the grindstone . It ’s not party time , it ’s work time . Fucking amateur . ”
35443	35452	35453	35453	Lauren	141	“ I ’m sorry to miss the christening , ”
35464	35471	35472	35472	he	477	“ When are you coming home ? ”
35475	35492	35472	35472	he	477	“ Is n’t your graduation soon ? You should let us take you out to dinner . ”
35493	35497	35498	35498	she	141	“ Good idea , ”
35526	35540	35541	35541	she	141	“ I ’ll send you and Mom the date . Got to go , ”
35544	35553	35541	35541	she	141	“ We ’re pulling up at the hotel . ”
35817	35831	35832	35832	she	141	“ You want to go over last week ’s ticket revenue split later ? ”
35846	35854	35855	35855	he	133	“ Does it look okay to you ? ”
35858	35863	35864	35864	Lauren	141	“ At first glance , ”
35867	35886	35887	35887	He	133	“ I want to add it up again before I decide that the box office got everything right . ”
35890	35910	35887	35887	He	133	“ You take care of it , then . Just shoot me an e - mail with the results . ”
35911	35931	35939	35939	Nate	133	“ Anything else ? I thought I ’d spend the afternoon working on next week ’s corporate sponsorship numbers . ”
35932	35938	35939	35939	Nate	133	“ Sounds like a plan , ”
36001	36033	36034	36034	Lauren	141	“ I ’m meeting up with Alex at six — an hour before the benefit . So I might need , uh , your services for a minute just before then . ”
36045	36052	36034	36034	Lauren	141	“ The bow tie , right ? ”
36053	36056	36057	36057	he	133	“ Yeah , ”
36061	36067	36057	36057	he	133	“ I hate black tie . ”
36068	36080	36034	36034	Lauren	141	“ Then why did you let Alex talk you into it ? ”
36081	36094	36095	36095	He	133	“ Some people are annoying when they do n’t get their way . ”
36098	36122	36095	36095	He	133	“ I ’ll give her black tie , but I wo n’t give away the router division for less than it ’s worth . ”
36123	36128	36129	36129	Lauren	141	“ Oh , Nate , ”
36132	36137	36129	36129	Lauren	141	“ I love you . ”
36187	36203	36172	36172	He	133	“ You should say that to people more often , Lauren . It suits you . ”
36204	36211	36212	36212	she	141	“ No , it does n’t , ”
36231	36245	36212	36212	she	141	“ I ’m too crusty to go around telling people I love them . ”
36246	36256	36264	36264	her	141	“ You ’re not , though . Not really . ”
36257	36260	36261	36261	she	141	“ Nate , ”
36267	36270	36261	36261	she	141	“ What ? ”
36284	36292	36293	36293	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll make you a deal , ”
36296	36311	36312	36312	He	133	“ I ’ll tell more people I love them if you do the same . ”
36425	36434	36435	36435	she	141	“ Knock when you need your tie tied , ”
36735	36774	36780	36780	Ari	180	“ I ’ve got some dress choices for Ari . But I ’ve also got practically an entire salon up here , including good lighting and those magnifying mirrors that make everyone ’s pores look like lunar craters . ”
36928	36932	36933	36933	Lauren	141	“ Hi there , ”
36945	36956	36957	36957	she	141	“ I did n’t think we ’d see you tonight , ”
36986	36997	36998	36998	Becca	211	“ I see that look of excitement on your face , ”
37001	37025	37026	37026	She	211	“ But , sadly , I ’m not back in action yet . My fancy new doctor has outlined several weeks of therapy . ”
37041	37082	37026	37026	She	211	“ I whined so loudly that Nate agreed to a temporary furlough . I ’ve been let out for good behavior for this party so long as I ’m back at the therapist ’s office in forty - eight hours . ”
37083	37086	37087	37087	Lauren	141	“ Oh . ”
37092	37115	37087	37087	Lauren	141	“ Ah , well . I guess I have to go to this fucking party after all . Somebody open the wine . ”
37116	37121	37122	37122	Georgia	137	“ This looks great , ”
37138	37150	37129	37129	She	137	“ You did n’t have to go to so much trouble . ”
37151	37162	37163	37163	Lauren	141	“ I did n’t make the sandwiches or the wine , ”
37167	37183	37163	37163	Lauren	141	“ And anyway — this will probably be the most enjoyable part of the evening . ”
37184	37191	37192	37192	Ari	180	“ Not a fan of parties ? ”
37195	37202	37192	37192	Ari	180	“ It depends on the party . ”
37203	37212	37213	37213	Becca	211	“ I brought the mani - pedi kit ! ”
37223	37230	37231	37231	She	211	“ This is a killer suite . ”
37238	37248	37231	37231	She	211	“ You have a hot tub ? Holy shit . ”
37249	37256	37257	37257	Lauren	141	“ It ’s a little much , ”
37260	37278	37279	37279	Becca	211	“ If we ca n’t get beautiful in here , there ’s really no help for us . ”
37282	37290	37279	37279	Becca	211	“ You ’re in a fun mood . ”
37291	37293	37231	37231	She	211	“ Fun ”
37304	37306	37279	37279	Becca	211	“ Frazzled ”
37313	37320	37321	37321	Georgia	137	“ So what is everybody wearing ? ”
37333	37348	37349	37349	She	137	“ If this party is on the beach , I brought the wrong shoes . ”
37359	37364	37365	37365	Lauren	141	“ That ’s pretty , ”
37368	37384	37365	37365	Lauren	141	“ I wear a lot of pink . It does nice things for my skin . ”
37385	37404	37349	37349	She	137	“ This one did nice things for my wallet . I found it on sale at Saks yesterday . ”
37405	37412	37413	37413	Rebecca	211	“ Shoes do n’t matter tonight , ”
37420	37470	37413	37413	Rebecca	211	“ The party is outside . I ’m just going to kick mine off and go barefoot . I flew all the way to Florida to feel some sand between my toes . I took a peek at the beach before my room was ready . It ’s gorgeous . ”
37510	37513	37514	37514	she	141	“ So , ”
37519	37528	37514	37514	she	141	“ Let ’s pick a dress for Ari . ”
37536	37543	37529	37529	Georgia	137	“ Ari looks good in everything . ”
37544	37548	37549	37549	Ari	180	“ If only , ”
37559	37570	37549	37549	Ari	180	“ I brought a simple black dress just in case . ”
37571	37578	37579	37579	Becca	211	“ You ca n’t wear black ! ”
37586	37609	37579	37579	Becca	211	“ I want to see you in one of Lauren ’s designer numbers . And I ’ll paint your toenails to match . ”
37610	37616	37617	37617	Lauren	141	“ Let ’s pick something , ”
37620	37634	37617	37617	Lauren	141	“ I brought six dresses . And not one of them is purple . ”
37651	37659	37660	37660	She	141	“ How do you feel about red ? ”
37679	37690	37691	37691	Ari	180	“ That ’s a little brighter than I usually go , ”
37694	37703	37691	37691	Ari	180	“ But the fabric is gorgeous . Wow . ”
37720	37728	37729	37729	she	141	“ Okay , this one is great , ”
37738	37760	37729	37729	she	141	“ But we ’d have to pad your bra . It ’s a little too big in the chest for me . ”
37761	37766	37767	37767	Ari	180	“ Oh , god , ”
37770	37796	37767	37767	Ari	180	“ If it ’s too big for you , it ’s never fitting me . There is n’t enough padding to make that one work . ”
37811	37821	37802	37802	She	141	“ I was n’t sure whether to bring this . ”
37822	37825	37826	37826	Becca	211	“ Why ? ”
37829	37848	37826	37826	Becca	211	“ That would look smashing on you , Lauren . It would make your eyes look super blue . ”
37863	37884	37849	37849	Lauren	141	“ Mike Beacon bought me this dress as a surprise . I wore it to a wedding here in Florida . ”
37885	37888	37889	37889	Becca	211	“ Wait ! ”
37892	37915	37889	37889	Becca	211	“ What do you mean he bought it as a surprise ? Like — he walked into a store and chose it ? ”
37916	37932	37933	37933	she	211	“ He did , in one of those boutiques on Collins Avenue in South Beach , ”
37948	37973	37933	37933	she	211	“ He bought it because he said it was exactly the same color as my favorite hydrangeas . It fit me perfectly , too . ”
37983	38007	37974	37974	Georgia	137	“ I love Leo desperately , but I ’d be terrified to see what he ’d walk out of a dress shop with . ”
38011	38019	38008	38008	Ari	180	“ Patrick would probably choose stripper wear . ”
38020	38023	38024	38024	Georgia	137	“ Right ? ”
38027	38039	38024	38024	Georgia	137	“ Try it on , Lauren . I want to see . ”
38040	38048	38049	38049	she	211	“ We ’re dressing Ari right now , ”
38052	38055	38056	38057	the publicist	397	“ True , ”
38064	38084	38056	38057	the publicist	397	“ But later I want a look at this mythical creature — a nice dress chosen by a man . ”
38109	38115	38116	38116	she	180	“ What do you think ? ”
38124	38127	38128	38128	Georgia	137	“ Cute ! ”
38131	38152	38128	38128	Georgia	137	“ It ’s so whimsical that I would n’t have thought you ’d like it . But it ’s adorable . ”
38159	38166	38153	38153	Ari	180	“ It ’s not too young ? ”
38167	38172	38173	38173	Lauren	141	“ Oh , please ! ”
38180	38204	38173	38173	Lauren	141	“ In the first place , you ’re still young . Because if you ’re old then there ’s no hope for me . ”
38208	38214	38205	38205	Becca	211	“ And furthermore . . . ”
38223	38253	38215	38215	Lauren	141	“ That looks fabulous . Your legs look about seven miles long , and your coloring makes you the only person I know who can wear white in April . ”
38254	38258	38259	38259	Becca	211	“ True dat , ”
38262	38277	38259	38259	Becca	211	“ Well , Georgia could . She ’s sort of golden all year round . ”
38298	38313	38278	38278	Ari	180	“ If you really do n’t mind , I ’d love to borrow it . ”
38314	38331	38259	38259	Becca	211	“ I really do n’t mind . Lending out a dress almost justifies my shopping habits . ”
38332	38339	38278	38278	Ari	180	“ I ’ll be really careful . ”
38340	38346	38278	38278	Ari	180	“ I ’m not worried . ”
38358	38366	38347	38347	Lauren	141	“ What are you wearing , Rebecca ? ”
38367	38423	38278	38278	Ari	180	“ I ’ll show you after we paint everyone ’s nails . Let ’s put a few inches of water in that ridiculous hot tub and we can all soak our feet . And Lauren — that glass of wine I poured is for you . I ’m not allowed to have any alcohol yet . ”
38424	38427	38428	38428	Lauren	141	“ Bummer , ”
38431	38436	38428	38428	Lauren	141	“ It really is . ”
38545	38548	38549	38549	Georgia	137	“ Wow ! ”
38552	38566	38549	38549	Georgia	137	“ I ’m glad you decided it was time to wear that one . ”
38567	38573	38574	38574	Becca	211	“ I know , right ? ”
38581	38619	38620	38620	She	211	“ I hope it ’s dressy enough . Nate asked me to have drinks with him before this shindig starts . He ’s meeting his old friend before the party starts , and he says . . . ”
38630	38653	38654	38654	Lauren	141	“ Stick close because I do n’t want to talk business . Alex wants to pick my pocket on the router division . ”
38657	38672	38654	38654	Lauren	141	“ Oh , Nate . Way to handle it like a grown - up . ”
38673	38683	38684	38684	Becca	211	“ I met Alex once a long time ago , ”
38687	38715	38684	38684	Becca	211	“ Do you think Nate has a thing for her ? Is there another angle , here ? Am I supposed to make her jealous or something ? ”
38716	38719	38720	38720	Lauren	141	“ No , ”
38724	38754	38720	38720	Lauren	141	“ Nate does n’t want to get an offer from Alex on the router division because he thinks he can get a better deal if someone else offers first . ”
38755	38758	38759	38759	Becca	211	“ Oh . ”
38762	38798	38759	38759	Becca	211	“ Tonight just got so much less interesting than I thought it was . Too bad I ’m not supposed to drink . Georgia — come here , honey . Let me fix your mascara . ”
38804	38811	38799	38800	Her friend	354	“ Did I goof it up ? ”
38812	38832	38759	38759	Becca	211	“ Not yet , baby doll . But you ’re probably going to . Let Auntie Becca do that . ”
38833	38841	38842	38842	Georgia	137	“ You have no confidence in me ! ”
38853	38861	38862	38862	Becca	211	“ I have every confidence in you , ”
38876	38897	38862	38862	Becca	211	“ Except when it comes to fashion and makeup . Now , Lauren ! Let ’s see that blue dress . ”
38898	38905	38862	38862	Becca	211	“ I ’m not wearing it . ”
38906	38915	38862	38862	Becca	211	“ Let ’s see it before you decide . ”
38960	38966	38967	38967	Ari	180	“ I ’ll zip you , ”
38974	38989	38967	38967	Ari	180	“ Whoa ! This fits you perfectly . When did you wear this last ? ”
38995	39000	38990	38990	Lauren	141	“ Three years ago . ”
39001	39012	39013	39013	Georgia	137	“ It ’s stunning . Guys — look at this . ”
39024	39027	39028	39028	Georgia	137	“ Wow ! ”
39034	39038	39032	39032	Becca	211	“ hummanah - hummanuh ”
39054	39058	39059	39059	she	141	“ Still fits , ”
39120	39128	39129	39129	Ari	180	“ You have to wear that one , ”
39139	39164	39129	39129	Ari	180	“ It ’s gorgeous . Either Beak got very lucky with the fit , or he ’s missed his calling as a fashion consultant . ”
39168	39197	39198	39198	she	141	“ I think we ’d have to go with luck on that one . He wears the same sweatshirt six days a week . Or he used to , ”
39213	39232	39202	39202	She	141	“ I ca n’t wear this dress . What if he remembers it ? That would be weird . ”
39233	39241	39242	39242	Georgia	137	“ Men do n’t remember that stuff , ”
39245	39252	39253	39253	Becca	211	“ And what if he did ? ”
39256	39276	39253	39253	Becca	211	“ That dress says : You had your chance , buddy . This is what you could have had . ”
39277	39281	39282	39282	Lauren	141	“ No kidding , ”
39285	39316	39282	39282	Lauren	141	“ But maybe it ’s obnoxious . Like waving a red flag in front of a bull . You should only do that if you want the bull to charge . ”
39317	39332	39333	39333	Georgia	137	“ I do n’t think the bull usually comes out ahead in those scenarios , ”
39337	39351	39333	39333	Georgia	137	“ The worst thing that could happen is that you shoot him down . ”
39352	39366	39367	39367	Becca	211	“ Here ’s a plan — you could pick up another guy tonight ! ”
39370	39388	39389	39389	She	211	“ Find yourself a nice basketball player . In that dress you ’ll be fighting them off . ”
39392	39429	39389	39389	She	211	“ That ’s my plan for the evening . But I ’ll look ridiculous with a basketball player . Maybe I should reconsider this barefoot idea . I need a couple of inches tonight . Hmm . ”
39430	39436	39437	39437	Lauren	141	“ Put your dress on , ”
39454	39465	39466	39466	They	1318	“ Let ’s see it with and without the shoes . ”
39528	39534	39535	39535	Georgia	137	“ Wow , you guys , ”
39538	39548	39535	39535	Georgia	137	“ The basketball team does n’t stand a chance . ”
39723	39726	39728	39728	Nate	133	“ Lauren ? ”
39732	39736	39737	39737	she	141	“ Hang on ! ”
39746	39752	39753	39753	Becca	211	“ We need a minute ! ”
39756	39762	39753	39753	Becca	211	“ We ’re not decent ! ”
39797	39801	39802	39802	she	141	“ Come in , ”
39851	39874	39848	39848	he	133	“ I ’ve been on the phone with Silicon Valley all day . Did n’t know there was a party next door . ”
39875	39883	39884	39884	Becca	211	“ You poor , poor , thing , ”
39899	39918	39887	39887	She	211	“ Did you really just knock on Lauren ’s door because you ca n’t tie a bow tie ? ”
39923	39928	39919	39919	His	133	“ I hate tuxes . ”
39939	39949	39929	39929	His	133	“ I thought you were n’t supposed to drink ? ”
39961	39976	39950	39950	Georgia	137	“ She ’s holding that for me so I could try on these shoes . ”
39977	39985	39986	39986	Becca	211	“ That ’s the truth , officer , ”
39989	40000	40001	40001	She	211	“ Now come closer so I can do this right . ”
40119	40127	40128	40128	Becca	211	“ So , about this thing tonight , ”
40156	40172	40144	40144	he	133	“ Am I your buffer for the whole evening ? Or just the beginning part ? ”
40173	40178	40179	40179	he	133	“ Just for drinks , ”
40186	40207	40179	40179	he	133	“ Alex ca n’t buttonhole me all evening . She ’ll have to work the room for her charitable cause . ”
40208	40211	40212	40212	Becca	211	“ Awesome ! ”
40225	40242	40212	40212	Becca	211	“ I want to dance with basketball players . They ’re probably quick on their feet . ”
40251	40261	40243	40243	Nate	133	“ It ’s almost time to meet Alex downstairs . ”
40262	40275	40276	40276	She	211	“ I know , slave driver . Let me grab my clutch . ”
40288	40298	40299	40299	She	211	“ Can I leave my things here for now ? ”
40308	40312	40313	40313	Lauren	141	“ Of course , ”
40317	40321	40313	40313	Lauren	141	“ Have fun . ”
40363	40373	40374	40374	Ari	180	“ Do you think she knows how Nate feels ? ”
40377	40383	40374	40374	Ari	180	“ Should we tell her ? ”
40384	40395	40396	40396	Georgia	137	“ I ’m still not sure I believe it myself , ”
40400	40450	40396	40396	Georgia	137	“ He showers a lot of attention on Becca , especially since her injury . But Nate ’s a great boss . He takes care of all of us in different ways . I would n’t want to put any ideas into Becca ’s head if they ’re false . ”
40487	40507	40474	40474	she	141	“ The person who needs to talk to Rebecca is the guy who ca n’t tie a bow tie . ”
40508	40515	40516	40516	Ari	180	“ Some people need a push , ”
40519	40527	40516	40516	Ari	180	“ It ’s not easy being Nate . ”
40528	40537	40538	40538	Lauren	141	“ Then who is it easy to be ? ”
40541	40571	40538	40538	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll give Nate a push myself , though . I can sense him meddling in my life lately , and I ’m kind of tired of it . ”
40572	40580	40581	40581	Georgia	137	“ Really ? What ’s he done ? ”
40599	40629	40592	40592	she	141	“ I have a difficult time believing that I ’m the only one who could step in to run the Bruisers ’ office while Rebecca is on sick leave . ”
40630	40638	40639	40639	Ari	180	“ He just trusts you the most , ”
40643	40689	40639	40639	Ari	180	“ Maybe . It ’s possible I ’m crazy . But it ’s also possible that Nate ’s supercomputer spit out a statistic suggesting that veteran goalies who are trying to impress their ex - girlfriends have an 8.2 % improvement of their save percentages . ”
40697	40704	40705	40705	Georgia	137	“ That does sound like Nate , ”
40708	40718	40719	40719	Ari	180	“ Or maybe it ’s the other way around , ”
40722	40737	40719	40719	Ari	180	“ Maybe his computer thinks happy office managers save the company 8.2 % annually . ”
40738	40756	40639	40639	Ari	180	“ Then he ’s doing it all wrong . Because this party does not make me happy . ”
40757	40771	40772	40772	Georgia	137	“ There is no rule that says you have to stay all night , ”
40776	40801	40772	40772	Georgia	137	“ Order your favorite drink , talk to a couple of cute basketball players , then spend the rest of the night watching Netflix . ”
40802	40812	40813	40813	Lauren	141	“ I really should find a cute basketball player , ”
40826	40853	40813	40813	Lauren	141	“ I would n’t have to make a big spectacle of it . Slipping a key into somebody ’s pocket can be done on the sly . ”
40854	40860	40861	40861	Lauren	141	“ You go , girl . ”
40903	40911	40912	40912	Georgia	137	“ Help me decide between these earrings , ”
40915	40918	40912	40912	Georgia	137	“ Sure . ”
41125	41129	41130	41130	Trevi	175	“ Four words , ”
41133	41141	41130	41130	Trevi	175	“ One time - out per game . ”
41142	41150	41153	41153	Ty	213	“ That ’s more than four words , ”
41172	41185	41186	41186	Leo	175	“ Not if ‘ time - out ’ is a compound word , ”
41189	41195	41186	41186	Leo	175	“ Oh , college boy , ”
41200	41206	41207	41207	he	143	“ Just ignore our rookie , ”
41216	41223	41207	41207	he	143	“ He ca n’t help it . ”
41224	41229	41230	41230	Leo	175	“ No — seriously , ”
41236	41253	41230	41230	Leo	175	“ How many time - outs are there in an average basketball game ? A million ? ”
41261	41289	41254	41254	Ty	213	“ But you guys have that little bench for when you ’re naughty , just like in kindergarten . Do n’t you get some rest over there ? ”
41309	41314	41315	41315	she	1356	“ I ’m Connie , ”
41323	41328	41329	41329	he	143	“ Hi , Connie , ”
41333	41338	41329	41329	he	143	“ I ’m Mike . ”
41342	41349	41350	41350	she	1356	“ I know who you are , ”
41353	41373	41350	41350	she	1356	“ Meeting you was one of my reasons for coming here tonight . I love to watch the goalie . ”
41374	41377	41378	41378	His	143	“ Yeah ? ”
41391	41401	41350	41350	she	1356	“ It ’s always nice to meet a fan . ”
41442	41454	41455	41455	she	1356	“ Tampa ’s offensive line is going to make you work , ”
41463	41469	41455	41455	she	1356	“ Especially that punk Martell . ”
41470	41473	41474	41474	He	143	“ Yeah ? ”
41506	41518	41499	41499	Connie	215	“ What tricks do you think he has in his bag ? ”
41519	41554	41555	41555	Mike	143	“ His trick is that he ’s unpredictable . He ’ll spend a whole game trying to get you with a toe drag , and then the following game he ’ll try something else . ”
41565	41589	41555	41555	Mike	143	“ You should see if our defensive coordinator is hiring any assistant coaches . I think you ’d be a shoo - in . ”
41768	41774	41775	41775	Connie	215	“ Then there ’s Skews , ”
41781	41793	41775	41775	Connie	215	“ He ’s going to give your man O’Doul some trouble . ”
41794	41799	41800	41800	O’Doul	134	“ Is that so ? ”
41978	41989	41968	41968	His	143	“ Beak , your tongue is hanging out . Hey . ”
42002	42006	41993	41993	his	134	“ You okay ? ”
42025	42029	42019	42019	O’Doul	134	“ Not really . ”
42030	42036	42037	42037	He	134	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
42046	42071	42039	42039	his	134	“ Seeing Lauren every day . It ’s killing me . I feel like I ’m watching a highlight reel of my own life . ”
42081	42091	42092	42092	He	143	“ Dude , I ’m sorry you miss her . ”
42160	42166	42167	42167	O’Doul	134	“ You never hook up , ”
42171	42184	42185	42185	He	143	“ Maybe there ’s someone else here who will catch your eye ? ”
42256	42267	42268	42268	he	143	“ You ’re right . I do n’t hook up , ”
42272	42345	42268	42268	he	143	“ I have a thirteen - year - old daughter who ’s gotten very good at noticing everything I do . God forbid I spend the night with some chick who snaps a photo of me , or brags about it on Twitter . Try explaining that to my nosy teenager . If I take somebody to bed it has to be somebody I trust . It has to be worth it . ”
42360	42363	42364	42364	O’Doul	134	“ Well . ”
42367	42407	42364	42364	O’Doul	134	“ I hear you . And I never really had much interest in the hookup scene , either . But then you need another hobby to burn off some of your energy . Shuffleboard , maybe . Or wakeboarding . ”
42408	42415	42416	42416	He	143	“ Let me ask you something . ”
42424	42457	42416	42416	He	143	“ Let ’s say you bought Ari a beautiful dress . The first time she wore it , the two of you had frantic sex in a hammock on a Florida beach . ”
42458	42466	42467	42467	Mike	143	“ There are hammocks on the beach ? ”
42473	42509	42467	42467	Mike	143	“ There are . But focus , okay ? So , three years later , Ari wears the dress again , at a party on a Florida beach . What do you think that means ? ”
42515	42533	42510	42510	O’Doul	134	“ I think it means — let ’s have sex again in a hammock on the beach . ”
42534	42543	42544	42545	Leo Trevi	175	“ Who ’s having sex in a hammock ? ”
42552	42568	42544	42545	Leo Trevi	175	“ You and Beak ? Does Ari know ? And how big is this hammock ? ”
42569	42576	42577	42577	O’Doul	134	“ You are such a comedian , ”
42587	42594	42595	42595	Mike	143	“ Are there really hammocks nearby ? ”
42598	42606	42607	42607	He	143	“ Yes , and you ’re welcome . ”
42615	42623	42624	42624	he	143	“ It ’s not over between us , ”
42660	42666	42667	42668	Leo Trevi	175	“ What ’s not over ? ”
42676	42683	42684	42684	O’Doul	134	“ Beak wants his girl back , ”
42687	42697	42684	42684	O’Doul	134	“ But he ’s facing some pretty steep odds . ”
42698	42708	42709	42709	Leo	175	“ I waited six years to get mine back , ”
42714	42768	42709	42709	Leo	175	“ I do n’t have six years . I do n’t even have six weeks . Once the play - offs are over , she ’ll be gone . You assholes better put some goals on the scoreboard in Tampa . I need to take this thing all the way to the Cup . ”
42769	42785	42786	42786	Leo	175	“ That ’s the weirdest motivation I ’ve heard for wanting to reach the finals , ”
42789	42798	42786	42786	Leo	175	“ But whatever works for you , man . ”
42807	42819	42801	42801	O’Doul	134	“ Some people play for glory . Some want the money . ”
42820	42834	42835	42835	Leo	175	“ But Beak plays for the puss . . . Hi , sweetheart ! ”
42849	42858	42859	42859	Georgia	137	“ What inglorious conversation have I stumbled into ? ”
42872	42898	42859	42859	Georgia	137	“ With twice as many athletes present as usual , I ’m sure the smack talk is flying . It better not be about me . ”
42899	42902	42903	42903	he	175	“ Never , ”
42910	42915	42903	42903	he	175	“ Dance with me ? ”
42916	42936	42937	42937	She	137	“ Only if you share your drink . The line at the bar got long all of a sudden . ”
42942	42946	42937	42937	She	137	“ Of course . ”
42962	42982	42947	42947	Leo	175	“ Want to take a walk on the beach , later ? I heard there were hammocks . . . ”
43212	43217	43218	43218	he	143	“ You summoned me ? ”
43239	43255	43234	43234	she	141	“ If you were summoned it was by someone else . That redhead , maybe . ”
43412	43420	43421	43421	He	143	“ You summoned me by wearing this . ”
43446	43456	43457	43457	she	141	“ I did n’t think you ’d even remember , ”
43763	43770	43771	43771	she	141	“ Rebecca ? Are you okay ? ”
43774	43780	43771	43771	she	141	“ I do n’t know , ”
43786	43792	43771	43771	she	141	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
43802	43822	43771	43771	she	141	“ I was n’t supposed to drink . But I thought a single glass of champagne would be okay . ”
43823	43829	43830	43830	Lauren	141	“ And it is n’t ? ”
43833	43840	43830	43830	Lauren	141	“ Not so much , no . ”
43841	43847	43771	43771	she	141	“ Do you feel sick ? ”
43854	43866	43867	43867	Becca	211	“ I thought I did , but my stomach is fine . ”
43871	43886	43867	43867	Becca	211	“ My head is all woozy , though . I need to go upstairs . ”
43887	43894	43895	43895	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll go with you , ”
43905	43918	43899	43899	Becca	211	“ Do n’t tell Nate . He ’ll be pissed at me . ”
43919	43925	43926	43926	Lauren	141	“ Oh , screw him , ”
43937	43944	43926	43926	Lauren	141	“ He does n’t control us . ”
43945	43964	43965	43965	She	141	“ But he ’s gone to so much trouble for me , and I ’m such an idiot . ”
43977	43993	43965	43965	She	141	“ The fancy new doctor said not to drink . And I did n’t listen . ”
43994	44000	44001	44001	Lauren	141	“ Lesson learned , then , ”
44005	44011	44001	44001	Lauren	141	“ Where are your shoes ? ”
44012	44017	44018	44018	Becca	211	“ Oh , crap , ”
44027	44036	44018	44018	Becca	211	“ I left them under a bar stool . ”
44054	44064	44018	44018	Becca	211	“ Sit here . I ’ll find your shoes . ”
44065	44080	44018	44018	Becca	211	“ Really ? I ’m sorry . You ’re being so nice to me . ”
44094	44105	44106	44106	She	141	“ It ’s fine . Just do n’t go anywhere . ”
44205	44221	44194	44194	Lauren	141	“ I ’m sorry you ’re not getting your sexy encounter with a basketball player . ”
44235	44260	44222	44222	Becca	211	“ This is n’t for special occasions . I always wear lingerie . It ’s my way of reminding myself that sex still exists . ”
44261	44281	44194	44194	Lauren	141	“ Huh . I should try that . And Nate would pee himself if he saw you in this . ”
44282	44285	44286	44286	Becca	211	“ Why ? ”
44291	44298	44299	44299	Lauren	141	“ Do you need any aspirin ? ”
44307	44314	44299	44299	Lauren	141	“ Or a glass of water ? ”
44315	44339	44194	44194	Lauren	141	“ I guess water is a good idea . I just feel so odd . Like I had ten drinks instead of two . ”
44340	44343	44344	44344	She	211	“ Hmm . ”
44354	44366	44344	44344	She	211	“ Look , do you think we should call your doctor ? ”
44367	44370	44371	44371	Becca	211	“ No ! ”
44374	44397	44371	44371	Becca	211	“ One glass of wine ca n’t kill me . I do n’t want to make a big deal out of it . ”
44398	44403	44404	44404	Lauren	141	“ Are you sure ? ”
44407	44414	44404	44404	Lauren	141	“ Nate wo n’t be mad . ”
44415	44421	44422	44422	Becca	211	“ Yes , he will ! ”
44448	44464	44439	44439	She	211	“ I ’m jus ’ gon na sleep it off . Do n’t tell anyone . ”
44465	44468	44469	44469	Lauren	141	“ Okay , ”
44472	44497	44469	44469	Lauren	141	“ Under one condition . You let me take your key card and come back to check on you in a couple of hours . ”
44498	44501	44502	44502	Becca	211	“ Deal , ”
44510	44515	44502	44502	Becca	211	“ S’on the desk . ”
44608	44614	44615	44615	he	133	“ Have you seen Rebecca ? ”
44625	44630	44631	44631	Lauren	141	“ Rebecca is fine , ”
44635	44650	44631	44631	Lauren	141	“ I just came from her room , and she ’s gone to bed . ”
44671	44687	44666	44666	Nate	133	“ I saw her stumble out of the party . She did not look well . ”
44688	44693	44694	44694	Lauren	141	“ Um . . . ”
44697	44731	44694	44694	Lauren	141	“ She was n’t feeling well , but she ’s really okay . And I ’m going to check on her again in a couple of hours . I ’ll set my alarm . ”
44740	44752	44732	44732	Nate	133	“ Did she drink ? Is that why you look guilty ? ”
44753	44760	44761	44761	Lauren	141	“ I ’m guilty of nothing , ”
44772	44786	44765	44765	He	133	“ Look — Becca thinks you ’re going to be mad at her . ”
44787	44798	44799	44799	He	133	“ For breaking the doctor ’s orders ? I am . ”
44813	44816	44799	44799	He	133	“ Why ? ”
44820	44873	44817	44817	Lauren	141	“ It ’s not your body , Nate . She ’s your employee . She ’s having a bit of a hard time , but you ca n’t go all medieval on her and bring down the wrath of the kingdom just because a single glass of wine hit her really hard . ”
44879	44900	44874	44874	He	133	“ I ’m supposed to be shaking hands all night for Alex . And instead I ’m worrying about Rebecca . ”
44908	44914	44915	44915	she	141	“ You poor overworked man , ”
44923	44982	44915	44915	she	141	“ Everything you do is your choice , Nate . So worry or not . But consider asking yourself why obsessing about Rebecca ’s health is your new favorite hobby . And if you say it ’s because you need her back at her desk running the Brooklyn office , I may not be responsible for my actions . ”
45064	45086	45049	45049	she	141	“ Look . This is her key . Am I using this to check on her later ? Or are you ? ”
45113	45120	45121	45121	Lauren	141	“ Just be nice , okay ? ”
45124	45129	45121	45121	Lauren	141	“ Do n’t scold . ”
45134	45138	45130	45130	His	133	“ All right . ”
45201	45208	45209	45209	she	141	“ She ’s in room 404 , ”
45213	45217	45218	45218	he	133	“ I know , ”
45356	45359	45360	45360	she	141	“ Hello ? ”
45538	45541	45542	45542	he	143	“ Hi , ”
45552	45561	45542	45542	he	143	“ I did n’t hear you come in . ”
45562	45566	45567	45567	Lauren	141	“ My apologies , ”
45584	45597	45567	45567	Lauren	141	“ I did n’t mean to startle you in my hotel room . ”
45598	45602	45603	45603	he	143	“ No problem , ”
45610	45619	45603	45603	he	143	“ Come in and take a load off . ”
45629	45658	45659	45659	He	143	“ How did you get in here ? Wait — I do n’t even care how . Just go , okay ? It ’s been a long day . ”
45717	45722	45723	45723	he	143	“ Forgot the glasses , ”
45771	45774	45753	45753	He	143	“ Mike ! ”
45788	45793	45753	45753	He	143	“ Yes , Lo ? ”
45804	45824	45825	45825	She	141	“ This is not your room ! Take your wine and hightail it back to wherever you ’re staying . ”
45890	45898	45899	45899	he	143	“ The first glass is for you , ”
45923	45958	45959	45959	His	143	“ I do n’t know what you ’re playing at . But stop , okay ? You ca n’t bluff your way into my room and pretend the last two years did n’t happen . ”
45995	46001	46002	46002	he	143	“ I ’m not playing , ”
46006	46023	46002	46002	he	143	“ I ’m well aware that the last two years happened , and they were terrible . ”
46055	46112	46049	46049	he	143	“ But we ’re both here and I have missed you . So here I am , Lo . Come and have a glass of champagne with me , because you ’re the only one in the whole goddamn state of Florida that I want to talk to , anyway . What are we waiting for ? ”
46159	46181	46182	46182	He	143	“ Maybe I wore the dress just to make a point . It ’s not like you do n’t deserve it . ”
46219	46231	46232	46232	he	143	“ There has n’t been enough champagne in my life lately , ”
46240	46246	46232	46232	he	143	“ Not much to celebrate . ”
46247	46250	46251	46251	she	141	“ Likewise , ”
46278	46295	46268	46268	He	143	“ See , I considered that maybe you wore that dress just to piss me off . ”
46373	46387	46388	46388	he	143	“ . . . But then I realized that ca n’t be it , ”
46403	46459	46460	46460	He	143	“ The Lauren I know is n’t a bitter person . She would n’t torture me , even if I deserved it . So I decided I was right the first time — the dress was a summons . An olive branch . I accept , baby . Have some champagne and sit with me . ”
46483	46490	46491	46491	she	141	“ Let me get this straight , ”
46502	46522	46491	46491	she	141	“ Either I jump on your dick in gratitude , or I ’ve become an angry , bitter person ? ”
46532	46549	46523	46523	His	143	“ That ’s an oversimplification , but I do like the sound of that first thing . ”
46593	46613	46616	46616	he	143	“ Maybe I did n’t mean to make a statement , Michael . Maybe it ’s just a dress . ”
46628	46676	46677	46677	He	143	“ It ’s not just a dress . And I ’m not just some guy you used to date . A lot went wrong between us , and I take all the blame , okay ? But we ’re both here . Right now . Just us . ”
46696	46699	46700	46700	He	143	“ Please . ”
46706	46726	46700	46700	He	143	“ There ’s eleven hours until we get on the bus to the airport . Spend them with me . ”
46795	46803	46804	46804	she	141	“ I ’m still angry at you , ”
46817	46840	46804	46804	she	141	“ I do n’t think that ’s going to go away even if I let you talk me out of my clothes . ”
46862	46870	46871	46871	he	1445	“ I know you ’re still mad , ”
46874	46892	46871	46871	he	1445	“ I ’m still mad at me , too . So we ’ll have that in common . ”
46970	46978	46979	46979	she	141	“ It ca n’t be that easy , ”
47001	47012	46979	46979	she	141	“ After all this time , it would be weird . ”
47013	47023	47024	47024	He	1445	“ That ’s the thing . It wo n’t . ”
47045	47061	47037	47037	he	1445	“ Drink your bubbly . It ’s a good bottle . I still love champagne . ”
47107	47116	47117	47117	he	1445	“ The guys tease me for drinking it , ”
47135	47179	47117	47117	he	1445	“ Sometimes I ’ll order a glass at the bar after we ’ve won a road trip game . Doulie will rib me about it while he slugs back the Scotch . But I drink it because it makes me think of you . ”
47243	47246	47247	47247	he	1445	“ Lo , ”
47256	47263	47247	47247	he	1445	“ Let me love you tonight . ”
47495	47509	47510	47510	he	1445	“ It ’s been too long since I felt your skin on mine , ”
47621	47642	47613	47613	she	141	“ I ca n’t , Mike . I just . . . I ca n’t have a fling with you . ”
47643	47652	47653	47653	She	141	“ Who says I want just a fling ? ”
47680	47709	47674	47674	Her	141	“ I ca n’t reevaluate my life choices just because you turned up in my hotel suite with a bottle of expensive bubbly . That ’s not fair . ”
47710	47719	47720	47720	He	1445	“ I ’m not trying to rush you . ”
47733	47759	47722	47722	his	1445	“ Okay , that ’s a lie . I am trying to inspire you . But only because we ’ve lost too much time already . ”
47760	47780	47781	47781	He	1445	“ So all of a sudden you remember that I exist , and now you ’re in a hurry ? ”
47793	47821	47781	47781	He	1445	“ Baby , I dream about you more often than it ’s healthy to admit . You ’re the one , Lo . There ’s nobody else . ”
47824	47836	47781	47781	He	1445	“ You had a hell of a way of showing it . ”
47837	47842	47843	47843	he	1445	“ You own me , ”
47846	47855	47843	47843	he	1445	“ I never wanted to let you go . ”
47856	47868	47869	47869	she	1450	“ It ’s not easy for me to believe in you , ”
47879	47891	47873	47873	He	1445	“ I know . But I ’m going to change that . ”
47965	47979	47958	47958	he	1445	“ What if I told you the last person I kissed was you ? ”
47985	48006	47980	47980	She	1450	“ Since you ambushed me on the sidewalk just the other night , forgive me if I ’m not impressed . ”
48014	48022	48009	48009	he	1445	“ Not then . Two years ago . ”
48028	48036	48023	48023	Her	1450	“ What are you trying to say ? ”
48083	48105	48068	48068	he	1445	“ The last person I kissed was you . The last person I took to bed was you . Just you . ”
48122	48129	48130	48130	she	1450	“ You ca n’t be serious , ”
48143	48151	48138	48138	he	1445	“ I ’ve never been more serious . ”
48152	48157	48158	48158	she	1450	“ But . . . ”
48161	48171	48158	48158	she	1450	“ You . . . Your wife . . . ”
48177	48198	48174	48174	his	1445	“ It was n’t like that with us . I was there to ease her pain . And Elsa ’s . ”
48199	48206	48207	48207	she	1450	“ That ’s so incredibly sad , ”
48215	48274	48275	48275	Lauren	141	“ Yeah , I noticed . I signed up for a whole lot of sad . But Shelly got one final year with her child , and she got a husband who came home whenever he could to tuck our kid into bed and try to convince the two of them that everything was going to be okay . ”
48289	48294	48283	48283	her	141	“ I ’m sorry . ”
48295	48300	48301	48301	His	1451	“ Do n’t be . ”
48310	48356	48306	48306	he	1451	“ Not trying to depress you . I ’m just telling you how it is with me , and that I ’ve always wanted you . Even if it ’s only for tonight . I ’m not dumb enough to ask you to make promises . ”
48405	48413	48414	48414	she	141	“ I ’m sorry for your troubles , ”
48417	48423	48414	48414	she	141	“ I really mean that . ”
48445	48462	48424	48424	He	1451	“ I know I came on strong tonight . But I meant every word I said . ”
48463	48476	48414	48414	she	141	“ It ’s not easy for me to give in to you . ”
48477	48501	48424	48424	He	1451	“ I ’ll bet it is n’t . Tell you what — let me fill up that kickass tub in the other room . ”
48502	48507	48508	48508	she	141	“ W - what ? ”
48511	48530	48508	48508	she	141	“ Let ’s have a soak . I ’m trying not to paw at you like a beast . ”
48655	48664	48665	48665	he	1451	“ Last one in is a total babe , ”
48689	48705	48682	48682	She	141	“ I ca n’t believe I ’m actually considering getting in that tub with you . ”
48706	48715	48682	48682	She	141	“ You hold all the cards , sweetheart . ”
48731	48747	48723	48723	Lauren	141	“ You know I want to . I never stopped wanting you , you jerk . ”
48751	48763	48764	48764	she	141	“ If I do this , it ’s just for tonight , ”
48767	48775	48764	48764	she	141	“ My life is complicated right now . ”
48783	48789	48764	48764	she	141	“ Is there someone else ? ”
48795	48819	48790	48790	She	141	“ Just a lot of changes I ’m considering . Graduating in a few weeks , making plans . That sort of thing . ”
48820	48823	48792	48792	her	141	“ Oh . ”
48850	48870	48890	48890	Lauren	141	“ Hop in , Lo . If a night is all I can have , I ’ll take it . ”
48979	48985	48986	48986	he	1451	“ Want help with that ? ”
49039	49042	49043	49043	he	1451	“ Jesus , ”
49046	49053	49043	49043	he	1451	“ Way to kill a guy . ”
49054	49062	49063	49063	she	141	“ You do n’t have to look , ”
49086	49129	49073	49073	He	1451	“ Yeah , I really do . But it ’s been two years since I saw anything that hot , so I might need one of those things you use to look at an eclipse of the sun without burning your retinas . ”
49130	49135	49136	49136	she	141	“ A pinhole camera ? ”
49152	49156	49157	49157	She	141	“ Yeah that . ”
49195	49204	49205	49205	she	141	“ You know why I wore the dress ? ”
49208	49211	49212	49212	he	1451	“ Mmm ? ”
49215	49220	49221	49221	she	141	“ Eyes up here , ”
49229	49249	49221	49221	she	141	“ The dress . I wore it because it ’s beautiful . And I wanted to feel beautiful again . ”
49250	49255	49256	49256	His	1451	“ Well it worked . ”
49262	49269	49256	49256	His	1451	“ Never seen anything so beautiful . ”
49446	49450	49451	49451	he	223	“ Killing me , ”
49454	49462	49451	49451	he	223	“ Like you do n’t deserve it ? ”
49472	49479	49463	49463	Her	141	“ What else do I deserve ? ”
49508	49512	49513	49513	he	223	“ Show me , ”
49625	49629	49630	49630	he	223	“ Come here , ”
49646	49649	49650	49650	he	223	“ Please , ”
49794	49799	49800	49800	He	223	“ Here , sweetheart . ”
49806	49814	49800	49800	He	223	“ I meant this to be relaxing . ”
49824	49829	49815	49815	She	141	“ Are you relaxed ? ”
49830	49834	49835	49835	he	223	“ Fuck no , ”
49901	49919	49891	49891	He	223	“ You ’re my happy thought , Lo . Thank you for being with me right now . ”
49991	49997	49998	49998	He	223	“ Come here , sweetheart . ”
50005	50012	49998	49998	He	223	“ I need to kiss you . ”
50300	50303	50292	50292	He	223	“ See ? ”
50304	50308	50309	50309	He	223	“ See what ? ”
50317	50352	50309	50309	He	223	“ This feels right . We feel right . Whether it ’s two years that passed or twenty - two , if I hold you in my arms it will always feel exactly right . ”
50546	50549	50550	50550	she	141	“ Mike , ”
50553	50557	50558	50558	he	223	“ I know , ”
50564	50576	50558	50558	he	223	“ You need me and you ’re going to get me . ”
50577	50585	50586	50586	she	141	“ We need a c - condom , ”
50589	50592	50593	50593	he	223	“ Okay , ”
50611	50615	50616	50616	He	223	“ Hang on . ”

51155	51158	51152	51152	she	141	“ Nothing . ”
51168	51182	51152	51152	she	141	“ Just thinking I want to lay you out on that big bed . ”
51183	51190	51191	51191	She	141	“ So what ’s stopping you ? ”
51242	51255	51256	51256	she	141	“ Careful . Do n’t injure yourself during play - offs season , ”
51265	51272	51273	51273	he	223	“ I ’m out of practice , ”
51283	51296	51273	51273	he	223	“ Let ’s see if I can remember how this is done . ”
51322	51327	51316	51316	He	223	“ Is this right ? ”
51328	51331	51332	51332	she	141	“ Almost , ”
51352	51356	51336	51336	He	223	“ And this ? ”
51470	51473	51474	51474	she	141	“ Jeez , ”
51482	51490	51491	51491	he	223	“ That only took the edge off , ”
51515	51521	51522	51522	she	141	“ Let ’s not talk , ”
51528	51535	51522	51522	she	141	“ I ’m all talked out . ”
51673	51676	51677	51677	he	223	“ Hey , ”
51684	51703	51677	51677	he	223	“ I have to go . But I was n’t going to leave without saying good - bye . ”

51760	51765	51766	51766	she	141	“ You ’re welcome , ”
51770	51781	51766	51766	she	141	“ I was pretty , uh , happy , too . ”
51791	51805	51806	51806	He	223	“ I really do n’t want to walk away from you right now . ”
51817	51830	51806	51806	He	223	“ I want to take you out for breakfast and cuddle more . ”
51831	51835	51836	51836	she	141	“ Not happening , ”
51840	51844	51806	51806	He	223	“ The bus boards in”—she
51847	51864	51865	51865	He	223	clock—“an hour . And I do n’t want to be everyone ’s gossip nugget this morning . ”
51870	51900	51865	51865	He	223	“ There are women who ’d sleep with me for the bragging rights . And the only one I want in my bed does n’t want anyone to know . ”
51901	51907	51908	51908	she	141	“ Well we tried that , ”
51912	51927	51908	51908	she	141	“ And when it ended , the gossip followed me , but not you . ”
51933	51944	51928	51928	He	223	“ This wo n’t be solved today , I guess . ”
51953	51968	51948	51948	She	141	“ Go start your day . The play - offs wait for no man . ”
51989	51998	51978	51978	his	223	“ Bye , Lo . Bye for now . ”
52256	52259	52260	52261	the publicist	397	“ Morning ! ”
52264	52289	52260	52261	the publicist	397	“ I come in search of my garment bag and Becca ’s manicure tackle box . She asked me to fetch it for her . ”
52295	52308	52290	52290	Georgia	137	“ Why do you think she ’d ask me to do that ? ”
52314	52340	52341	52341	She	141	“ I had to tuck her in last night . She drank a little and got woozy . It was n’t that embarrassing , though . ”
52350	52364	52341	52341	She	141	“ Oh , no ! Is she okay ? I would have helped . ”
52365	52379	52341	52341	She	141	“ She ’s fine . I sent Nate to check on her later . ”
52380	52388	52389	52389	Georgia	137	“ Do you think . . . ? ”
52394	52405	52389	52389	Georgia	137	“ Maybe something happened between her and Nate last night ? ”
52406	52411	52412	52412	Lauren	141	“ In my dreams , ”
52457	52467	52442	52442	Georgia	137	“ Wow , Lauren ! Did you do it ? ”
52468	52473	52474	52474	Georgia	137	“ Um , what ? ”
52490	52503	52474	52474	Georgia	137	“ Did you seduce a basketball player ? You ’re my hero . ”
52571	52576	52558	52558	she	141	“ Do n’t laugh . ”
52577	52596	52558	52558	she	141	“ I would n’t dream of it . As long as I get at least one juicy detail . ”
52603	52608	52598	52598	she	141	“ No can do . ”
52609	52620	52558	52558	she	141	“ Not even his position ? Point guard ? Center ? ”
52621	52624	52625	52625	Lauren	141	“ Goalie , ”
52629	52632	52633	52633	Georgia	137	“ Oh , ”
52636	52639	52633	52633	Georgia	137	“ Yeah . ”
52640	52654	52655	52655	Lauren	141	“ Wow . You were right . That dress has some powerful mojo . ”
52663	52685	52655	52655	Lauren	141	“ I guess it does . Do n’t tell anyone , okay ? It is n’t going to become a thing . ”
52686	52694	52655	52655	Lauren	141	“ Huh . Does he know that ? ”
52695	52700	52655	52655	Lauren	141	“ I hope so . ”
52701	52710	52711	52711	Georgia	137	“ Maybe Florida makes people a little crazy , ”
52723	52745	52711	52711	Georgia	137	“ Leo and I did it in a hammock on the beach last night . I ’ve never done that before . ”
52753	52765	52746	52746	Lauren	141	“ It is Florida ’s fault . Let ’s blame Florida . ”
52909	52918	52919	52919	He	143	“ Is there a problem with the schedule ? ”
52941	52948	52949	52949	Jimbo	161	“ We ’re waiting on Nate , ”
52952	52955	52949	52949	Jimbo	161	“ Ah . ”
53033	53042	53029	53029	Georgia	137	“ Omigod . Look . Out the window . ”
53073	53076	53055	53055	Nate	133	“ So ? ”
53077	53112	53113	53113	Lauren	141	“ Becca got into that car first — she ’s flying back to New York out of the Lauderdale airport . Do you think he ’s . . . kissing her good - bye ? ”
53152	53158	53159	53159	Georgia	137	“ Did you see that ? ”
53166	53175	53159	53159	Georgia	137	“ I do n’t know what I saw . ”
53212	53215	53216	53216	he	133	“ Problem ? ”
53224	53230	53231	53231	Lauren	141	“ Not in this row , ”
53243	53246	53247	53247	He	133	“ You ? ”
53262	53268	53269	53269	Georgia	137	“ Maybe I imagined it , ”
53272	53275	53269	53269	Georgia	137	“ Maybe , ”
53416	53443	53404	53404	Lauren	141	“ I know I gave you different information this morning , but the host team keeps switching our ice time , so the schedule changed again . ”
53444	53467	53468	53468	Lauren	141	“ No problem . But . . . do you think it ’s intentional ? Are they messing with us on purpose ? ”
53475	53496	53468	53468	Lauren	141	“ That would be pretty low . I wo n’t do that when they come to Brooklyn in two days . ”
53497	53501	53502	53503	Leo Trevi	175	“ Do it ! ”
53514	53533	53502	53503	Leo Trevi	175	“ And let ’s short - sheet all their beds , and put itching powder in their underwear . ”
53534	53544	53545	53545	Lauren	141	“ Someone spent too many years at summer camp , ”
53548	53559	53560	53560	He	175	“ You know it ! We were worse , though . ”
53569	53588	53560	53560	He	175	“ I found a dead frog in my shoe one time , so I put it . . . ”
53595	53605	53589	53589	Lauren	141	“ I get it . But it ’s lunchtime . ”
53657	53661	53671	53671	Mike	143	“ Hi there , ”
53679	53688	53671	53671	Mike	143	“ Are you ready for round two yet ? ”
53708	53711	53712	53712	she	141	“ Sure , ”
53716	53726	53712	53712	she	141	“ As long as you ’re talking about hockey . ”
53727	53738	53739	53739	Lauren	141	“ Ah , well . It was worth a shot . ”
53755	53761	53762	53762	he	175	“ Join me for lunch ? ”
53765	53771	53772	53772	she	141	“ I wish I could , ”
53776	53795	53772	53772	she	141	“ But I have a ton to do before the game , and Nate is expecting me upstairs . ”
53796	53801	53802	53802	he	175	“ Maybe another time , ”
53841	53849	53850	53850	he	175	“ How are you doing , anyway ? ”
53853	53884	53850	53850	he	175	“ Have n’t seen you at all in Tampa . I ’d think you were avoiding me , except Coach has had us in strategy sessions for hours and hours . ”
53913	53929	53885	53885	She	141	“ Fine , thank you . And yourself ? Has Coach been working you hard ? ”
53930	53935	53936	53936	He	175	“ You know it . ”
54004	54011	54012	54012	she	141	“ You love food so much , ”
54028	54044	54012	54012	she	141	“ I ’m surprised you never learned to cook something more than pancakes or steak . ”
54045	54056	54057	54057	he	175	“ I love food , but I ’m a specialist , ”
54062	54067	54057	54057	he	175	“ I only eat . ”
54087	54096	54097	54097	she	141	“ I ’d better get back to it , ”
54109	54115	54116	54116	he	175	“ Enjoy your working lunch , ”
54122	54135	54119	54119	his	175	“ But feel free to wear your blue dress to dinner tonight . ”
54136	54145	54146	54146	she	141	“ That was a one - time thing , ”
54150	54155	54146	54146	she	141	“ A special occasion . ”
54159	54186	54156	54156	He	175	“ Okay . Then do n’t wear it . You look sexy in your cute little suits , girlfriend . I can still see those legs . ”
54241	54248	54249	54249	she	141	“ Good luck out there tonight , ”
54252	54260	54249	54249	she	141	“ I ’ll be pulling for you . ”
54272	54282	54266	54266	His	175	“ Thanks , Lo . That means a lot . ”
54283	54288	54266	54266	His	175	“ You ’re welcome . ”
54371	54379	54380	54380	Whistling	229	“ See you on the other side . ”
55386	55400	55401	55401	he	133	“ Just do n’t take your shiny degree and defect to the competition , ”
55722	55730	55731	55731	Beacon	143	“ You were killing it out there , ”
55761	55766	55750	55751	Their teammates	1576	“ You feel good ? ”
55767	55786	55787	55788	the kid	2891	“ Sure . But I always feel good in practice . I do n’t blow it until later , ”
55831	55834	55835	55835	Mike	143	“ Hey , ”
55844	55883	55835	55835	Mike	143	“ Do n’t talk yourself down . It ’s not like you to get all mopey . You ’re a better team player than that . I heard you were doing great in Hartford this spring , too . ”
55913	55974	55908	55908	Silas	169	“ Did pretty good in Hartford . But my expectations were pretty low , so I was n’t a basket case , you know ? I did n’t used to be that guy who cracks under pressure . But now that I know how it feels to be that guy , I do n’t know how to shake it off . ”
55975	55982	55983	55983	Beacon	143	“ You go back to basics , ”
55986	56018	55983	55983	Beacon	143	“ You remind yourself there ’s never been a goalie with a hundred percent save average . Never . That ’s what I tell myself every time someone scores on me . ”
56019	56022	55908	55908	Silas	169	“ Yeah ? ”
56023	56080	56081	56081	Silas	169	“ Sure . Because if I stand there and worry about it , I ’m not doing my job for the team . My job is n’t to feel bad about what just happened . My job is to make the next save . And I ca n’t do that if I ’m beating myself up . ”
56168	56171	56176	56176	he	139	“ Look , ”
56189	56243	56183	56183	He	139	“ That ’s a little sloppy right there . It ’s the same story we ’ve been looking at all morning . This team has had terrific success the last couple of years , and everyone expects great things from them . But they look stressed out and it shows in their skating . ”
56258	56324	56325	56325	He	139	“ We can do this . It is n’t about skills anymore . And it is n’t about the stats . We ’ve got those already , and we ’re pretty healthy , too . The team who wins this series will be the team who believes it can . It ’s going to be about heart , and about faith . I have mine . ”
56333	56364	56325	56325	He	139	“ Right here . So I need you to show me yours tonight . Bring it with you from this room , and carry it with you onto the ice . ”
56431	56434	56435	56435	Coach	139	“ Beacon , ”
56438	56444	56435	56435	Coach	139	“ Something on your mind ? ”
56445	56448	56449	56449	He	143	“ Yeah . ”
56455	56491	56449	56449	He	143	“ I think you ’re right , Coach . They ’re feeling the strain . We can use it . They ’re gon na fight dirty , though . Be ready for that , guys . ”
56492	56495	56496	56496	O’Doul	134	“ Yeah . ”
56503	56554	56496	56496	O’Doul	134	“ So I think we try to keep our noses clean for the first period tonight . Neither Crikey or I will throw down , even if we ’re baited early . I think it ’ll make ’em crazy if we hold off a bit . Let these guys simmer . ”
56567	56572	56573	56573	Coach	139	“ I like it , ”
56576	56648	56573	56573	Coach	139	“ Cooler heads prevail , and all that . We ’re back on our home ice after this one , too . The tide is about to turn in our favor . I can feel it . And now I want you boys rested . Go upstairs and take a nap , okay ? Turn your phones off . No caffeine . We ’ll see you at five thirty for yoga . ”
56720	56726	56727	56730	the kid tending bar	1597	“ What do you think ? ”
56741	56746	56747	56747	he	139	“ Coulda gone worse , ”
56754	56762	56750	56751	The kid	2891	“ I ’m rooting for you guys . ”
56763	56766	56727	56730	the kid tending bar	1597	“ Yeah ? ”
56767	56775	56750	56751	The kid	2891	“ Yeah . Grew up in Jersey . ”
56776	56781	56750	56751	The kid	2891	“ Well , thanks . ”
56794	56800	56802	56802	he	139	“ Do n’t mention it . ”
56944	56951	56952	56952	he	143	“ Nice office you got here , ”
56955	56961	56952	56952	he	143	“ I know , right ? ”
56970	57004	56962	56962	Her	1603	“ Some business trips are easier than others . Sometimes you get a deck chair , and sometimes you ’re in the Middle East , wearing a potato sack and covering your hair . ”
57005	57008	57054	57054	she	1603	“ Seriously ? ”
57009	57028	57054	57054	she	1603	“ Sure . In Riyadh our hotel had a women ’s only floor , which was pretty trippy . ”
57029	57038	57039	57039	He	143	“ Where else have you been with Nate ? ”
57074	57092	57061	57061	Lauren	141	“ Shanghai . Tokyo . Singapore . Taiwan . Turns out conference rooms look the same everywhere . ”
57093	57100	57054	57054	she	1603	“ That ’s all you see ? ”
57101	57151	57152	57152	He	143	“ No — we always have at least a day of sightseeing . Nate ’s fun . I ’ve been to the Great Wall of China . Another time he booked us a sushi - eating tour of Tokyo . I ’ve never been so full in my life . ”
57226	57236	57237	57237	she	141	“ Are n’t you supposed to be upstairs resting ? ”
57240	57250	57237	57237	she	141	“ I ’m resting . Look at me rest . ”
57273	57278	57279	57279	he	143	“ Hey , Lo ? ”
57282	57294	57279	57279	he	143	“ You need me to rub any sunscreen on your back ? ”
57312	57318	57305	57305	she	141	“ Thanks but no thanks . ”
57319	57328	57329	57329	She	141	“ Ca n’t blame a guy for trying . ”
57337	57351	57329	57329	She	141	“ Go nap , Michael . Your team needs you to be perky . ”
57352	57358	57359	57359	She	141	“ I ’m perky already . ”
57366	57387	57359	57359	She	141	“ Right . Then can you watch my stuff for a second so that I can buy an iced tea ? ”
57388	57396	57397	57397	He	143	“ I ’ll get it for you . ”
57421	57426	57401	57401	She	141	“ Be right back . ”
57699	57702	57703	57703	she	141	“ What ? ”
57714	57717	57718	57718	he	143	“ Nothing , ”
57889	57892	57876	57876	his	143	“ Lauren ? ”
57893	57896	57897	57897	He	143	“ Yeah ? ”
57934	57941	57942	57942	she	141	“ Oh my God , what ? ”
57978	57987	57954	57954	She	141	“ Nate ? I ’m by the pool . ”
58020	58027	58028	58028	she	141	“ I ’ll be right there , ”
58031	58042	58028	58028	she	141	“ It ’s hard to concentrate out here , anyway . ”
58050	58056	58043	58043	She	141	“ See you in five . ”
58057	58060	58061	58061	he	143	“ Sorry , ”
58068	58075	58061	58061	he	143	“ I know you ’re busy . ”
58076	58084	58085	58085	She	141	“ Go take a rest , Mike . ”
58120	58128	58098	58098	she	141	“ See you at the rink tonight . ”
58502	58506	58507	58507	he	235	“ Fuck you ! ”
58518	58522	58523	58524	The ref	1038	“ C’m on . ”
58531	58538	58523	58524	The ref	1038	“ That was a clean check , ”
58542	58558	58559	58560	the ref	1038	“ Really ? You want to fight it ? We can make it four minutes , ”
58563	58567	58559	58560	the ref	1038	“ Fuck you , ”
58572	58583	58584	58584	He	235	“ Bunch of little fucking faggots , all of you . ”
58591	58594	58595	58595	Trevi	175	“ Classy , ”
58626	58629	58630	58630	Beacon	143	“ Hey ! ”
58636	58664	58630	58630	Beacon	143	“ You ca n’t let him say that shit ! How many kids do you think just heard that ? Bet the network got it on camera . ”
58794	58798	58799	58800	the ref	1038	“ Unsportsmanlike conduct , ”
59005	59010	59011	59011	he	143	“ Trevi ’s open ! ”
59028	59032	59033	59033	he	143	“ Man on ! ”
59159	59167	59168	59168	Coach	139	“ Well boys , that was interesting , ”
59175	59214	59168	59168	Coach	139	“ You better lock this one up now . That ’ll really make ’em squirm . And you need to show that whole goddamn arena you can clobber them with this weird - ass opportunity you just created . ”
59215	59222	59223	59223	Beacon	143	“ We did n’t create it , ”
59227	59237	59223	59223	Beacon	143	“ Skews did with his punk - ass mouth . ”
59238	59244	59245	59245	Coach	139	“ Excellent point , sir . ”
59253	59284	59245	59245	Coach	139	“ My mistake . But your game better follow through . Capitalize on this disruption . Do n’t let ’em get their shit together before you get your shots off . ”
59374	59379	59380	59380	Beacon	143	“ They ’re desperate , ”
59390	59395	59380	59380	Beacon	143	“ We like that . ”
59396	59399	59400	59400	Trevi	175	“ Right , ”
59475	59543	59468	59469	Georgia Worthington	137	“ The network has your face in the clip they spliced together about the Skews ejection . And the journalists are asking questions . I ’m going to have them come into the dressing room to ask you what happened , okay ? Because if I put you on the dais at the press conference , that makes the incident seem like some kind of Bruisers strategy . ”
59544	59549	59550	59550	He	143	“ Huh . Okay . ”
59592	59602	59603	59603	Georgia	137	“ What do you plan to say about it ? ”
59606	59623	59603	59603	Georgia	137	“ They ’ll want to know what made you prod the ref over Skews ’s behavior . ”
59624	59654	59570	59570	her	137	“ I ’ll just say that I did n’t want my daughter to think that hockey players were homophobic . And that we do n’t ever use that word . ”
59670	59695	59663	59663	He	143	“ If they press me , I ’ll say that Elsa and I have close friends who battle discrimination , and it bothers us . ”
59696	59702	59703	59703	Georgia	137	“ Or it saddens you , ”
59732	59739	59719	59719	He	143	“ Fine . I ’m saddened . ”
59766	59774	59775	59775	he	143	“ Is this where the party is ? ”
59783	59794	59795	59795	He	143	“ Give me sixty seconds and I ’m all yours . ”
59838	59853	59820	59820	he	143	“ Why did you ask the ref to consider a different penalty for Skews ? ”
59854	59864	59820	59820	he	143	“ Was it part of a strategy for Brooklyn ? ”
59865	59874	59893	59893	He	143	“ Are you involved with gay rights issues ? ”
59875	59888	59889	59889	he	143	“ I heard the comment , and I did n’t like it , ”
59903	59940	59893	59893	He	143	“ My child is a hockey fan . She was watching the game tonight . We talk about discrimination at home , so it , uh , saddened me to hear that word at the rink . ”
59951	59970	59971	59971	he	143	“ If a player dropped a racial slur in a game , he ’d be punished , right ? ”
59974	59982	59971	59971	he	143	“ This was exactly the same thing . ”
59983	59997	59999	60007	a male reporter who was scribbling on a notepad	1683	“ It did n’t hurt that Tampa lost one of their best players , ”

60031	60052	60021	60021	he	143	“ I was n’t thinking about the outcome — only that his language was n’t something the league should condone . ”
60076	60091	60092	60092	He	143	“ That ’s all I really have to say about it . Thank you . ”

60236	60261	60262	60262	He	143	“ I was like , here we go again ! And then they threw him out of the game ! And then you won ! ”
60265	60277	60262	60262	He	143	“ I did n’t know that would happen — the ejection . ”
60278	60300	60230	60230	She	1685	“ Hans and I had an extra root beer to celebrate . I do n’t know if I can sleep now . ”

60340	60343	60230	60230	She	1685	“ Okay . ”
60344	60349	60350	60350	Hans	155	“ Hallo , Beak , ”

60395	60410	60230	60230	She	1685	“ I do n’t know what to say . Thanks for taking a stand . ”
60411	60455	60366	60368	The German hipster	1686	“ You do n’t have to thank me . Lot of people would have said something . And now I ’m going to be accused of doing it just to gain advantage on the ice . So that ’s gon na be fun . ”
60456	60459	60460	60460	Hans	155	“ Ja ? ”
60463	60474	60460	60460	Hans	155	“ Tell ’em you did it for your gay roommate . ”
60475	60485	60486	60486	He	155	“ Uh - huh . Think of the headlines . ”
60490	60506	60486	60486	He	155	“ Good night . I ’ll pry Elsa ’s phone out of her hands now . ”

70968	71006	70936	70936	she	141	“ Still . I was trying to get my brother to do a little aversion therapy . How am I ever going to get any free babysitting out of him if he ’s afraid of the baby ? ”
71007	71013	71014	71014	Castro	172	“ I ’m not afraid , ”
71017	71028	71014	71014	Castro	172	“ Just . . . inexperienced . And Lauren asked . ”

71080	71085	71014	71014	Castro	172	“ She does that , ”
71094	71120	71121	71121	Lauren	141	“ The baby is a boy , right ? So be careful . Lauren is famous for helping herself to men that are n’t hers . ”

71326	71329	71330	71330	he	143	“ Hey , ”
71333	71346	71330	71330	he	143	“ God . That was . . . Are you all right ? ”

71923	71935	71920	71920	He	143	“ Maybe ? Rough day ? Want to talk about it ? ”
71972	72007	72038	72038	She	141	“ I ’ll be fine . I missed a doctor ’s appointment in New York today . No big deal . It ’s just that things just did n’t work out like I planned . ”
72010	72019	72020	72020	he	143	“ This time it ’s not my fault , ”
72031	72037	72038	72038	She	141	“ Where ’s the TV ? ”

72446	72455	72440	72440	She	141	“ I ca n’t be casual about this . ”
72456	72468	72440	72440	She	141	“ It ’s not casual at all . Not to me . ”
72469	72504	72440	72440	She	141	“ But if I conceive , then there ’s a new person who ’s smack in the middle of all our old troubles . It ’s complicated . I need to think about that . ”
72515	72525	72506	72506	he	143	“ So you are thinking about it , then ? ”
72556	72582	72583	72583	He	143	“ You take all the time you need . I ’ll just sit here and mind my own business . Forget I ’m even here . ”
72716	72721	72722	72722	Lauren	141	“ Something the matter ? ”
72739	72760	72725	72725	her	141	“ Yeah , there is . We could be making a baby right now , and we ’re watching this . ”
72761	72770	72771	72771	she	141	“ That ’s just the postgame horniness talking , ”
72782	72801	72771	72771	she	141	“ Oh , it ’s talking . But not so loudly that I ca n’t hear myself think . ”
72802	72809	72810	72810	He	143	“ Mike , I need time . ”

73668	73677	73663	73663	she	141	“ You ’re smug , are n’t you ? ”
73678	73685	73663	73663	she	141	“ Only about a few things . ”
73686	73693	73663	73663	she	141	“ Which are . . . ? ”
73694	73736	73737	73737	She	141	“ I ’m good at keeping a six ounce hunk of rubber out of the net . I have a smart kid . And I can make you into a needy puddle of a girl just by chewing on your neck . ”
73747	73750	73744	73744	he	143	“ See ? ”
73770	73775	73776	73776	he	143	“ Christ , Lo , ”
73780	73794	73776	73776	he	143	“ That was probably good for triplets . Or twins , at least . ”
73797	73802	73803	73803	He	143	“ Bite your tongue . ”
73850	73858	73844	73844	He	143	“ I ’m all in . Literally . ”

73895	73906	73886	73886	he	143	“ You ca n’t get rid of me so easily . ”
73922	73929	73930	73930	he	143	“ Do n’t panic , honey , ”
73933	73941	73930	73930	he	143	“ It ’s going to be okay . ”
73945	73950	73951	73951	she	141	“ You panicked once , ”
73955	73960	73961	73961	He	143	“ That was fun . ”
73966	73976	73961	73961	He	143	“ Fair enough . But I learned my lesson . ”
73977	73984	73990	73990	he	143	“ Let me up , okay ? ”

74161	74179	74180	74180	He	143	“ Do n’t you have to go back to your own room ? Is Elsa there alone ? ”
74183	74208	74209	74209	He	143	“ I should get back before she wakes in the morning . But she ’s in a room that adjoins Hans and Justin ’s . ”
74219	74240	74209	74209	He	143	“ We have a few more hours . I can set my alarm for early in the morning . . . ”
74355	74361	74362	74362	he	143	“ If you get pregnant , ”
74367	74376	74362	74362	he	143	“ these will get all firm and heavy . ”

74469	74478	74479	74479	he	143	“ Ca n’t wait to give you babies , ”
74487	74494	74479	74479	he	143	“ One might not be enough . ”
74520	74525	74503	74503	he	143	“ You like that ? ”
74546	74555	74556	74556	he	143	“ We ’ll have to practice a lot , ”
74562	74568	74556	74556	he	143	“ Stay agile . . . ”
74652	74658	74659	74659	he	143	“ Take it , sweetheart , ”

74708	74712	74713	74713	he	143	“ Oh yeah , ”
74751	74760	74761	74761	he	143	“ I do n’t think I can move , ”

75533	75568	75520	75520	She	141	“ I know we have n’t gotten around to talking about what jobs you might pursue after graduation . But I have some ideas . And sitting in today fits with one of them . ”

75836	75847	75833	75833	Lauren	141	“ But I can think of a dozen problems already . ”

75981	76003	75958	75958	she	141	“ The ongoing contract they need will prevent you from working with any of their competitors in certain lines of business . ”
76004	76007	76008	76008	he	133	“ Right ? ”
76018	76029	76008	76008	he	133	“ That bothers me . A lot . What else ? ”
76046	76068	76069	76069	he	133	“ I hope you did n’t have plans tonight , because we ’re going to be sorting through this for hours , ”

76193	76219	76189	76189	Nate	133	“ She wants to get back to work . So I asked Hugh to send an intern with her , because she still tires easily . ”
76220	76224	76225	76225	Lauren	141	“ Good idea , ”
76281	76303	76278	76278	Nate	133	“ There ’s a job I need from you — something a little different . I need a dossier on iBits . ”
76304	76307	76308	76308	she	141	“ Sure , ”
76312	76346	76308	76308	she	141	“ Although . . . you have a team of I - bankers who can give you chapter and verse on that company . Do you really want me to duplicate their efforts ? ”
76347	76454	76278	76278	Nate	133	“ Yeah , I do . They ’ll give me all the numbers . But I want you to figure out how things really are at iBits . I do n’t know this company at all . Are their employees happy ? What do people say about them ? Do your special Lauren thing and tell me all the dirt you can find . They want a ten - year contract , so I need to know if these are people I ’d look forward to working with , or people I ’d rather strangle . Nobody knows me as well as you do , right ? ”
76455	76462	76463	76463	she	2069	“ Okay . I get it , ”
76520	76526	76527	76527	she	2069	“ I ’m on it , ”
76655	76663	76664	76664	he	133	“ Alex wo n’t pay as much , ”
76674	76687	76668	76668	his	133	“ But her offer does n’t require a ten - year contract . ”
76688	76707	76708	76708	Lauren	141	“ . . . Which you would n’t mind giving Alex anyway because you already know her company , ”
76712	76715	76716	76716	Nate	133	“ Right . ”
76719	76742	76716	76716	Nate	133	“ I do n’t know which offer I ’m going to end up taking . Thanks for all your help this week . ”
76743	76747	76748	76748	He	133	“ My pleasure . ”
76755	76764	76748	76748	He	133	“ We need to talk about the future . ”
76770	76784	76785	76785	He	133	“ It ’s ten o’clock , Nate . It ’s already the future . ”
76788	76815	76785	76785	He	133	“ You know what I mean . Your graduation is next month . You ’re going to get job offers . If you have n’t already . ”
76905	76917	76918	76918	she	141	“ This company paid a big chunk of my college tuition , ”
76922	76939	76918	76918	she	141	“ I have a huge incentive to stay here unless I want to pay it back . ”
76953	76987	76940	76940	He	133	“ That ’s what signing bonuses are for . I do n’t know what they ’re offering you , but do n’t say yes to anything until you let me counter , okay ? ”
76988	76991	77006	77006	he	133	“ Okay . ”
76995	77005	77006	77006	he	133	“ I know you ’ll need a new position , ”
77010	77033	77006	77006	he	133	“ You did n’t just put yourself through college to manage my office forever . I have a few ideas for you . ”
77034	77038	77006	77006	he	133	“ You do ? ”
77055	77096	77097	77097	Lauren	141	“ Sure . This whole scramble with iBits makes me realize how badly I need an ear to the ground in Silicon Valley . New York has its benefits , but I need someone who can gather intel in California . ”
77105	77113	77097	77097	Lauren	141	“ How would that work , exactly ? ”
77114	77128	77129	77129	He	133	“ I have an office there already , but it ’s only techies . ”
77143	77207	77129	77129	He	133	“ I ’d just expand it a little . You ’d be my California manager , and you ’d meet with whoever we were thinking of doing business with . I know the idea is a little . . . loose at the moment . But this is only going to become more important now that the venture capital market has picked up . ”
77208	77212	77213	77213	Lauren	141	“ I see , ”
77234	77248	77223	77223	She	141	“ You ’d need a title . Maybe vice president of special projects . ”
77269	77288	77264	77264	Nate	133	“ You ’re right — it ’s late . Can we pick up this discussion later this week ? ”
77289	77292	77264	77264	Nate	133	“ Sure . ”
77309	77330	77333	77333	she	141	“ Just keep me in the loop . Do n’t let any of those recruiters bat their eyelashes at you . ”
77339	77345	77333	77333	she	141	“ Good night , Nate . ”
77346	77349	77361	77361	yourself	2090	“ Night . ”
77893	77909	77887	77887	he	143	“ Hello there , hot stuff . Is your phone burning up in your hand ? ”
77910	77919	77920	77920	Lauren	141	“ You ’re going to get me fired , ”
77941	77960	77931	77931	her	141	“ No , I ’m not . Sexting is the great American pastime . Hang on a sec . ”
77967	77988	77931	77931	her	141	“ There . Now my right hand is free in case you have anything you want to say to me . ”
77989	77993	78028	78028	her	141	“ I do . ”
77994	77997	78028	78028	her	141	“ Yeah ? ”
77998	78008	78009	78009	He	143	“ Nice save in the third period last night . ”
78012	78017	78009	78009	He	143	“ You tease me . ”
78018	78024	78025	78025	she	141	“ I ’d like to , ”
78045	78054	78042	78042	he	143	“ So . Do you feel any different ? ”
78070	78097	78057	78057	her	141	“ No ! It ’s only been three days . I know you ’re a super stud , but there ’s no way to know yet . ”
78098	78107	78108	78108	He	143	“ How long do we have to wait ? ”
78125	78156	78108	78108	He	143	“ I ’ll start thinking about it in two weeks . Or , if you keep nagging me , I ’ll think about it every minute between now and then . ”
78157	78164	78057	78057	her	141	“ And that ’s not good ? ”
78165	78190	78057	78057	her	141	“ It ’s fine as long as I do n’t need to use my brain for anything else . Like top secret business negotiations . ”
78191	78211	78108	78108	He	143	“ I see . Sure wish you were here right now . I ’d make you forget about everything . ”
78212	78221	78057	78057	her	141	“ I have no doubt that ’s true . ”
78222	78230	78057	78057	her	141	“ When can I see you again ? ”
78231	78249	78057	78057	her	141	“ That ’s not an easy question , is it ? You ’re back in town when ? ”
78250	78273	78108	78108	He	143	“ Thursday . But I do n’t have a game until Saturday . So — have dinner with me Thursday or Friday ? ”
78274	78296	78057	78057	her	141	“ Sure . Let ’s say Friday because Nate and I will probably be done burning the midnight oil by then . ”
78297	78305	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ Is that good for the baby ? ”
78309	78330	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ You ’re hysterical . If there is one , it ’s the size of a grape seed right now . ”
78331	78336	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ There is one . ”
78337	78346	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ Mike ! You do n’t know that . ”
78347	78353	78354	78354	he	2110	“ Yes , I do , ”
78400	78411	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll have dinner with you under one condition . ”
78412	78417	78418	78418	he	2110	“ Here it comes , ”
78421	78441	78418	78418	he	2110	“ Tell me what I have to do to take you out for dinner , oh , great one . ”
78442	78455	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ No talk of babies . It ’s just an ordinary date . ”
78456	78460	78461	78461	he	2110	“ All right , ”
78465	78484	78461	78461	he	2110	“ I thought you were going to ask me to do something difficult . Like slay a dragon . ”
78485	78497	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ I should have asked you to shut out Detroit tomorrow . ”
78498	78507	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ I ’m going to do that anyway . ”
78508	78515	78461	78461	he	2110	“ You are a cocky bastard . ”
78516	78524	78306	78306	Lauren	141	“ But I ’m your cocky bastard . ”
78562	78568	78461	78461	he	2110	“ Detroit Crumbles under the Pressure ”
78673	78676	78677	78677	he	2110	“ Sunday ? ”
78680	78695	78677	78677	he	2110	“ Swear to god I ’ll call in sick if they schedule anything else . ”
78696	78711	78712	78712	she	141	“ Do n’t call in sick , you ’ll give Silas a heart attack , ”
78715	78728	78712	78712	she	141	“ Sunday is fine . As long as you win tomorrow night . ”
78769	78772	78773	78773	Elsa	151	“ Dad ? ”
78790	78793	78773	78773	Elsa	151	“ Yeah ? ”
78810	78820	78821	78821	Busted	253	“ Are you cleaning up the house or something ? ”
78823	78829	78821	78821	Busted	253	“ A little . Sure . ”
78830	78833	78773	78773	Elsa	151	“ Why ? ”
78834	78848	78849	78849	Hans	155	“ It ’s gotten a little sloppy since the play - offs started . ”
78873	78878	78879	78879	Truth	257	“ And . . . ”
78882	78899	78900	78900	He	2110	“ Lauren is coming over for a minute before we step out to get some dinner . ”
78908	78915	78900	78900	He	2110	“ You want to join us ? ”
78933	78936	78923	78923	she	151	“ No . ”
78937	78947	78923	78923	she	151	“ You mean ‘ no , thank you ? ’ ”
78948	78954	78955	78955	she	151	“ No , thank you , ”
78970	78983	78958	78958	He	2110	“ Are n’t you even going to ask where we ’re going ? ”
78984	78987	78988	78988	She	151	“ Nope . ”
78998	79009	78988	78988	She	151	“ Dibs on the leftover Indian food in the fridge . ”
79010	79016	79017	79017	he	2110	“ It ’s all yours , ”
79273	79276	79277	79277	he	2110	“ Hi , ”
79284	79287	79288	79288	she	141	“ Hi , ”
79296	79301	79288	79288	she	141	“ Come on in . ”
79310	79331	79332	79332	He	2110	“ Can I take your coat ? I thought we ’d have a beer before we went out for dinner . ”
79457	79462	79453	79453	he	2110	“ Sure missed you . ”
79463	79468	79469	79469	She	141	“ I could tell . ”
79552	79559	79560	79560	he	2110	“ Come inside for a minute ? ”
79563	79568	79560	79560	he	2110	“ Want the tour ? ”
79574	79584	79569	79569	Lauren	141	“ Jeez , Mike . Your house is gorgeous . ”
79585	79618	79619	79619	He	2110	“ Thanks . I ca n’t take any credit . The seller did all the modernizing . All I had to do was try not to ruin it with my old furniture . ”
79671	79677	79678	79678	he	2110	“ How about that beer ? ”
79687	79692	79693	79693	she	141	“ Well . . . ”
79699	79726	79693	79693	she	141	“ You go ahead . But I ’m going to lay off the alcohol for a little while . Because . . . you never know . ”
79743	79751	79729	79729	He	2110	“ Sorry . I ’m easily distracted . ”
79800	79808	79809	79809	he	2110	“ Let me show you the house , ”
79817	79827	79809	79809	he	2110	“ There ’s something I want you to see . ”
79828	79833	79834	79834	she	141	“ Private bowling alley ? ”
79837	79847	79834	79834	she	141	“ Wine cellar ? Man cave in the basement ? ”
79863	79882	79848	79848	He	2110	“ The basement is a hundred and fifty years old , unimproved . Definitely not on the tour . ”
79883	79890	79891	79891	She	141	“ Holy cow — your kitchen . ”
79902	79907	79891	79891	She	141	“ That is fancy . ”
79908	79912	79913	79913	he	2110	“ I know , ”
79916	79935	79913	79913	he	2110	“ And Hans is the only one who cooks in it . Elsa and I are takeout connoisseurs . ”
79956	79988	79989	79989	He	2110	“ There ’s two bedrooms on this floor , and then a little room Hans calls his office . It ’s full of instruments and sheet music . But keep climbing . ”
80010	80020	80021	80021	He	2110	“ So . . . this is my room . ”
80025	80040	80021	80021	He	2110	“ You brought me upstairs to show me your bedroom ? What a shocker . ”
80041	80046	80047	80047	He	2110	“ Subtle , right ? ”
80059	80067	80068	80068	he	2110	“ Never got around to decorating it , ”
80071	80092	80068	80068	he	2110	“ We ’ve only been here eight months , and nobody but me ever comes up here . But look . ”
80152	80155	80156	80156	she	141	“ Oh , ”
80160	80169	80156	80156	she	141	“ It ’s supposed to be . . . ”
80170	80174	80175	80175	he	2110	“ The nursery , ”
80191	80194	80178	80178	Her	141	“ Hey . ”
80207	80233	80236	80236	he	2110	“ I know you think I ’m headstrong , and maybe it ’s true . But I ’m ready for whatever you ’ll give me . ”
80274	80294	80260	80260	he	2110	“ I do n’t know exactly what the future holds . But I ca n’t wait to find out . ”
80362	80365	80366	80366	Elsa	151	“ Daddy ! ”
80406	80412	80403	80403	he	2110	“ What do you need ? ”
80413	80420	80421	80421	He	2110	“ Help ! With math homework ! ”
80427	80448	80424	80424	his	2110	“ I think my kid is telepathic . She has n’t asked me for help with math in a year . ”
80449	80456	80457	80457	Lauren	141	“ Must be important , then , ”
80488	80494	80495	80495	She	151	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
80516	80522	80505	80505	she	151	“ What is a polynomial ? ”
80523	80528	80529	80529	Mike	143	“ Well . . . ”
80532	80543	80544	80544	Lauren	141	“ Uh . . . ‘ Poly ’ means many . ”
80550	80572	80573	80573	Mike	143	“ A polynomial is an expression containing different powers of the same variable . For example—3 plus 2x plus x squared . ”
80578	80585	80573	80573	Mike	143	“ Yeah . What she said . ”
80593	80598	80587	80587	Elsa	151	“ Any more questions ? ”
80607	80616	80604	80604	her	513	“ Want to get some dinner with us ? ”
80621	80638	80639	80639	She	151	“ Okay then . I ’ll be back in an hour . My phone is on . ”
80655	80660	80661	80661	he	143	“ Let ’s go ! ”
80673	80682	80661	80661	he	143	“ Italian or Thai . You can pick . ”
80727	80748	80716	80716	He	143	“ Well , I love the guy . But there are days when I feel like listing him on eBay . ”
80749	80752	80753	80753	he	143	“ Why ? ”
80758	80764	80753	80753	he	143	“ Because he ’s arrogant ? ”
80765	80768	80769	80769	She	151	“ No . ”
80775	80879	80771	80771	her	151	“ He is n’t arrogant at all . It ’s like . . . he already knows he ’s smarter than everyone else , and the disparity is n’t worth dwelling upon . But he goes off on these mad scientist tangents where he ’ll hole up in his office with a couple of engineers and shut out the rest of the world . They ’re in there reinventing the telecommunications industry , and meanwhile I have to explain to five or six heads of industry why Nate is suddenly unavailable for the conference call he asked me to schedule a week ago . ”
80880	80886	80769	80769	She	151	“ That ’s pretty rude . ”
80887	80964	80771	80771	her	151	“ Yes and no . His shareholders and his business associates depend on his acts of genius to stay ahead of the competition . So he ca n’t always be tugged in a dozen directions . My job is to keep the rest of the world at bay when he needs me to . But there are days when I feel like a lion tamer , fighting off his distractions with a chair and a whip . ”
80965	80968	80969	80969	Her	2156	“ Mm . ”
81002	81007	80995	80995	he	2157	“ So . . . ”
81020	81051	81008	81008	He	2157	“ I need to break our taboo topic for a second , because I ’m curious . Are you going to keep working for him if you have a baby ? ”
81052	81056	81057	81057	she	2156	“ Of course , ”
81061	81112	81057	81057	she	2156	“ I have to work . And Nate has onsite childcare . There are only a handful of companies in the city that offer it . I wo n’t be able to travel , though . But someone else on my team can take over that part of my job . ”
81113	81117	81008	81008	He	2157	“ Your team ? ”
81118	81130	81008	81008	He	2157	“ There are four of us running the C - suite . ”
81131	81139	81057	81057	she	2156	“ And you ’re the boss lady ? ”
81140	81144	81008	81008	He	2157	“ Of course . ”
81152	81162	81145	81145	She	2156	“ Ca n’t believe you even had to ask . ”
81166	81182	81163	81163	He	2159	“ Sorry . I thought maybe world domination took a little longer than two years . ”
81195	81213	81183	81183	Lauren	141	“ World domination does take longer . I ’ve only asserted control of one Fortune 500 company . ”
81214	81229	81163	81163	He	2159	“ The place would grind to a halt without you , I ’ll bet . ”
81230	81242	81243	81243	She	2156	“ Not immediately , because I ’ve trained my underlings well . ”
81249	81278	81243	81243	She	2156	“ Nate has been chatting me up about taking a new job , though . We have n’t gotten to the part where he lays out the specifics . ”
81279	81287	81288	81288	He	2159	“ That could be good , right ? ”
81318	81323	81324	81324	She	2156	“ We ’ll see . ”
81348	81381	81343	81343	he	2159	“ How do you feel about our chances against Detroit tomorrow ? They had a great season , but they seem to be choking . What do you think of their defense ? ”
81382	81396	81397	81397	she	2156	“ Until this week , I have n’t been paying attention to Detroit , ”
81406	81428	81429	81429	She	2156	“ Really ? Nate must have you traveling all over hell if you do n’t have this year ’s stats memorized . ”
81432	81444	81429	81429	She	2156	“ I have n’t followed hockey . Not since . . . ”
81450	81455	81447	81447	her	2156	“ Two years ago . ”
81456	81460	81447	81447	her	2156	“ At all ? ”
81483	81505	81478	81478	She	2156	“ It reminded me too much of my old life , and watching would have been like staying in the past . ”
81569	81577	81578	81578	She	141	“ Actually , I watch golf now . ”
81583	81586	81578	81578	She	141	“ Golf ? ”
81598	81638	81592	81592	she	141	“ I like it for its gamesmanship , and its tension . I mean , the aggression , right ? And you never know what ’s going to happen with those golf carts . It gets hairy out there . ”
81639	81642	81681	81681	her	141	“ Yeah ? ”
81653	81660	81645	81645	She	141	“ You are so fucking gullible . ”
81669	81674	81675	81675	She	141	“ Jesus , Lo . ”
81699	81707	81689	81689	He	143	“ I was trying to picture it . ”
81708	81712	81713	81713	She	141	“ I know . ”
81910	81917	81918	81918	Lauren	141	“ I ’d better head back , ”
81934	81942	81943	81943	She	141	“ I ’ll call you a car . ”
81951	81967	81945	81945	her	141	“ Just walk me to the subway . It ’s the fastest way to Midtown . ”
81973	81979	81980	81980	she	141	“ Thank you for dinner , ”
81993	81997	81998	81998	he	143	“ Any time , ”
82005	82026	81998	81998	he	143	“ I mean that literally . When the play - offs are over , we can spend more time together . ”
82027	82033	82034	82034	she	141	“ That would be nice , ”
82059	82070	82044	82044	He	143	“ I wish you were still traveling with the team . ”
82095	82098	82087	82087	She	141	“ What ? ”
82104	82111	82101	82101	her	141	“ Call me when you can . ”
82112	82121	82122	82122	She	141	“ I will , honey . Of course . ”
82175	82182	82183	82183	He	143	“ Hey — thanks for this . ”
82189	82202	82183	82183	He	143	“ I could n’t remember if I asked you to grab them . ”
82203	82231	82183	82183	He	143	“ You did not , but I just guessed you had to pack tonight so I stopped in and asked them if they had anything for you . ”
82232	82238	82239	82239	Mike	143	“ You ’re the best . ”
82269	82278	82183	82183	He	143	“ Uh , is that an original composition ? ”
82279	82282	82283	82283	Hans	155	“ Ja , ”
82286	82296	82283	82283	Hans	155	“ She ’s been playing it for a while . ”
82297	82306	82307	82307	Hans	155	“ What ’s her damage ? Math homework ? ”
82310	82321	82307	82307	Hans	155	“ Math . And also something about you and dinner . ”
82324	82330	82307	82307	Hans	155	“ Did she eat dinner ? ”
82331	82336	82283	82283	Hans	155	“ Ja . Some . ”
82337	82344	82345	82345	He	143	“ I ’ll go say hello . ”
82386	82389	82390	82390	he	143	“ Hi , ”
82423	82429	82430	82430	he	143	“ What ’s shakin ’ ? ”
82433	82441	82442	82442	She	151	“ Now you want to hang out ? ”
82448	82454	82442	82442	She	151	“ Something wrong with now ? ”
82463	82485	82459	82459	her	151	“ You ’ll be with Lauren in Detroit , right ? But tonight was your only night to be with me . ”
82489	82512	82459	82459	her	151	“ You know what ? I was home for hours today . You were on your phone for a lot of it . ”
82526	82536	82459	82459	her	151	“ You have friends . I ’m not allowed ? ”
82537	82540	82541	82541	she	151	“ Friends , ”
82548	82575	82544	82544	her	151	“ Mom ’s been in the ground a whole year now . Guess it ’s time for you to go running back to your slutty girlfriend . ”
82576	82579	82580	82580	he	2180	“ Elsa ! ”
82588	82591	82592	82592	she	151	“ What ? ”
82602	82621	82622	82622	he	2180	“ I ca n’t believe . . . No — I’m ashamed to hear you talk like that , ”
82625	82646	82622	82622	he	2180	“ And what ’s more ? If your mother heard you say that , she ’d be ashamed , too ! ”
82691	82698	82699	82699	she	151	“ Get OUT of my room ! ”
82787	82790	82791	82791	Beacon	143	“ Shit . ”
82920	82927	82928	82928	Mike	143	“ I knew I liked you , ”
82939	82951	82952	82952	Hans	155	“ Maybe wait until tomorrow to talk about it with her , ”
82956	82970	82952	82952	Hans	155	“ At least . She ca n’t go around calling people . . . ”
82985	83016	82982	82983	Poor Lauren	141	“ But if I went in there right now we ’d both say more things we regret . I should n’t have mentioned Shelly . That was a low blow . ”
83017	83026	83027	83027	Hans	155	“ Shelly would not like her behavior tonight , ”
83031	83078	83079	83079	Mike	143	“ But if Shelly were still alive , Elsa would not be acting this way . She ’s angry all the time . When one of her friends mentions she did this or that activity together with her mom , you should see Elsa ’s face . ”
83082	83089	83079	83079	Mike	143	“ I ca n’t fix that . ”
83090	83095	82982	82983	Poor Lauren	141	“ Of course not . ”
83096	83102	83103	83103	Mike	143	“ I just . . . ”
83108	83118	83103	83103	Mike	143	“ There ’s no way for her to understand . ”
83119	83126	82982	82983	Poor Lauren	141	“ That her mother is gone ? ”
83127	83143	83103	83103	Mike	143	“ Yeah . And that I ’m going to get on with my life eventually . ”
83147	83155	83156	83156	Shit	259	“ She ’s going to hate it . ”
83169	83176	83177	83177	Hans	155	“ I think you ’re wrong , ”
83181	83186	83177	83177	Hans	155	“ Join the club . ”
83192	83222	83187	83189	The other man	569	“ No — I think she can understand a lot . She ’s fighting you because she ’s afraid of more change . But not all change is bad . ”
83223	83232	83233	83233	Mike	143	“ There ’s going to be more change , ”
83242	83247	83233	83233	Mike	143	“ A lot more . ”
83248	83260	83261	83261	Mike	143	“ I hope the hinges on her bedroom door are strong . ”
83270	83285	83261	83261	Mike	143	“ Let ’s keep the beer stocked . We ’re going to need it . ”
83383	83388	83389	83389	Georgia	137	“ Glass of wine ? ”
83392	83401	83389	83389	Georgia	137	“ You look like you could use one . ”
83414	83422	83402	83402	She	141	“ No , thanks . Too nervous . ”
83423	83444	83365	83365	She	141	“ More for me ! Tommy is handling the press conference tonight , so I can be the tipsy publicist . ”
83466	83479	83459	83459	Lauren	141	“ I think I ’ve aged a decade in these two periods . ”
83480	83483	83484	83484	Ari	180	“ Honestly , ”
83487	83502	83484	83484	Ari	180	“ Civilizations have risen and fallen since the puck dropped . It ’s torture . ”
83555	83574	83548	83548	he	133	“ Did n’t expect to see you here tonight . Look who remembered she ’s a hockey fan ? ”
83575	83581	83582	83582	she	141	“ Do n’t be smug , ”
83585	83594	83595	83595	He	133	“ I ’m here in an official capacity . ”
83600	83604	83595	83595	He	133	“ How so ? ”
83605	83617	83618	83618	Georgia	137	“ I ’m here to remind you not to be smug . ”
84297	84303	84304	84304	he	263	“ Hot date , maybe ? ”
84315	84327	84304	84304	he	263	“ Please do n’t tell me you worked late again tonight . ”
84328	84342	84343	84343	He	263	“ Not this time . I was at the hockey game in Brooklyn . ”
84350	84366	84347	84347	his	263	“ Yeah ? I did n’t take you for a hockey fan , Miss Lauren . ”
84390	84422	84423	84423	His	263	“ For the record , I did n’t take you for a hockey fan , either . But I used to work for the team . Before I moved to Manhattan . ”
84428	84440	84423	84423	His	263	“ Shut the front door ! You know all the players ? ”
84441	84445	84423	84423	His	263	“ Pretty much . ”
84455	84462	84463	84463	Jerry	263	“ Stay cool , Miss Lauren ! ”
84470	84477	84478	84478	she	141	“ You too , big man ! ”
84572	84575	84560	84560	She	141	“ Jerry ? ”
84583	84604	84605	84605	He	263	“ Sorry to ring you so late but you have a visitor . Mike Beacon is here to see you . ”
84614	84618	84605	84605	He	263	“ He is ? ”
84630	84639	84640	84640	Jerry	263	“ That ’s what I said , too , ”
84643	84682	84640	84640	Jerry	263	“ It ’s one thing to drop this bomb on me that you know the team . It ’s , like , a whole other level of gossip when the goalie shows up asking for you at midnight . ”
84683	84689	84718	84718	he	263	“ Send him up already . ”
84690	84696	84699	84699	Jerry	263	“ Go on , sir , ”
84702	84705	84699	84699	Jerry	263	“ Apartment 12B. ”
84725	84736	84718	84718	he	263	“ We are going to have to discuss this later . ”
84737	84741	84718	84718	he	263	“ We are ? ”
84742	84762	84718	84718	he	263	“ Most def . And do you know how a guy could get an autograph for his little girl ? ”
84763	84770	84718	84718	he	263	“ Angelique is a hockey fan ? ”
84782	84814	84718	84718	he	263	“ She has a poster of Castro up on her wall . She said , ‘ Look , Daddy , you can play hockey even if you have brown skin . ’ ”
84815	84832	84718	84718	he	263	“ Oh , man . I ’ll have to hook that girl up with a jersey . ”
84833	84848	84718	84718	he	263	“ You are the coolest resident of 251 East 32nd Street , Miss Lauren . ”
84849	84861	84718	84718	he	263	“ I ’ll bet you say that to all the girls . ”
84870	84882	84718	84718	he	263	“ Got ta fly , Jerry . My visitor is knocking . ”
84883	84891	84892	84892	He	2243	“ Do n’t let me keep you ! ”
84926	84932	84933	84933	He	2243	“ Hey . You okay ? ”
84936	84945	84933	84933	He	2243	“ No gold star on my phone tonight . ”
84946	84952	84953	84953	She	141	“ What ? Gold star ? ”
84961	84978	84953	84953	She	141	“ When we win , our Katt Phones all have gold stars on the login screen . ”
84979	84997	84998	84998	He	2243	“ Okay . So , uh . . . How did you know where to find me ? ”
85014	85029	84998	84998	He	2243	“ Got your address from Becca when I sent you pickles and ice cream . ”
85030	85033	85034	85034	She	141	“ Mm . ”
85048	85063	85064	85064	He	2243	“ And you just decided to stop by for tea and crumpets at midnight ? ”
85074	85092	85093	85093	He	2243	“ It ’s been eleven days since I held you and I could n’t take it anymore . ”
85123	85135	85136	85136	He	2243	“ I used to come home to you after a game . ”
85148	85167	85136	85136	He	2243	“ Did n’t matter if I won or lost . You were happy to see me either way . ”
85272	85282	85261	85261	she	141	“ Wo n’t your family wonder where you are ? ”
85283	85290	85291	85291	he	2243	“ They do n’t wait up , ”
85297	85304	85291	85291	he	2243	“ Tomorrow ’s a school day . ”
85336	85339	85340	85340	she	141	“ What ? ”
85343	85364	85340	85340	she	141	“ I miss the hell out of you , that ’s all . I miss you so much it hurts . ”
85391	85405	85406	85406	He	2243	“ I miss you , too . But everything is just so complicated . ”
85412	85420	85406	85406	He	2243	“ It ’s like we invented complicated . ”
85421	85428	85450	85450	him	2243	“ I love you , Mike . ”
85436	85447	85450	85450	him	2243	“ Love you , too , Lo . Never stopped . ”
85461	85466	85467	85467	She	141	“ Come to bed . ”
85471	85483	85467	85467	She	141	“ It ’s late . It ’s been a long day . ”
85484	85490	85491	85491	He	2243	“ You ’re telling me . ”
85499	85504	85491	85491	He	2243	“ Lead the way . ”
85524	85531	85532	85532	she	141	“ The bathroom is right here , ”
85542	85547	85532	85532	she	141	“ Make yourself comfortable . ”
85689	85693	85694	85694	he	2243	“ Nice apartment , ”
85703	85715	85716	85716	she	141	“ It ’s dark . You ca n’t even see it , ”
85722	85735	85719	85719	He	2243	“ You ’re in it . That ’s what makes it nice . ”
85761	85772	85751	85751	He	2243	“ Come here , sweetheart . Let me hold you . ”
85893	85904	85905	85905	he	2243	“ I had a terrible fight with Elsa last night , ”
85909	85921	85905	85905	he	2243	“ Oh , I ’m sorry ! Was it about me ? ”
85929	85943	85922	85922	He	2243	“ It ’s never really about you . It ’s always about me . ”
85944	85964	85965	85965	He	2243	“ I understand . But she did n’t like it that I showed up to have dinner with you . ”
85968	86017	85965	85965	He	2243	“ It ’s just going to take her some time to accept her mother ’s loss . She ’s angry , and any little thing that changes makes her jumpy . But life is full of change . It does n’t stop to let you get your bearings . ”
86018	86027	86028	86028	she	2252	“ Did you make up with her yet ? ”
86039	86094	86028	86028	she	2252	“ Sort of . We both apologized . But lately she ’s like a grenade with the pin pulled , you know ? I never know when she ’s going to blow . I ca n’t tell which parts are grief , and which parts are just plain thirteen - year - old girl . ”
86095	86103	85965	85965	He	2243	“ Is there someone she talks to ? ”
86104	86146	85965	85965	He	2243	“ Like a shrink ? She had one for a year on Long Island . But then we moved . The doctor told me she ’d be happy to find us someone in Brooklyn if I thought we still needed it . ”
86147	86152	86153	86153	Lauren	141	“ Maybe you do , ”
86160	86198	86157	86157	He	2255	“ I ’ll call tomorrow . I feel like a shit dad all the time . Shelly did all these things as a full - time job , you know ? She also needs braces , probably . ”
86199	86212	85965	85965	He	2243	“ In three weeks you ’ll be available full time for her . ”
86213	86219	86220	86220	He	2255	“ Three weeks , huh ? ”
86228	86248	86220	86220	He	2255	“ You ’re taking us to the finals in your little calculation . That ’s a jinx , missy . ”
86249	86263	86264	86264	They	2256	“ You can blame me if it all goes wrong in game seven . ”
86306	86313	86296	86296	She	141	“ What ’s the countdown now ? ”
86314	86317	86285	86285	his	2255	“ On ? ”
86318	86334	86285	86285	his	2255	“ Our secret project . When am I allowed to ask how it ’s going ? ”
86335	86360	86296	86296	She	141	“ You ’re asking right now . That ’s against the rules . The ref just gave you a two - minute bench minor . ”
86361	86370	86285	86285	his	2255	“ So I can ask in two minutes ? ”
86371	86377	86378	86378	He	2255	“ Oh , fuck off . ”
86384	86392	86378	86378	He	2255	“ Give me a week at least . ”
86393	86399	86285	86285	his	2255	“ That ’s too long . ”
86400	86403	86285	86285	his	2255	“ Mike ! ”
86404	86422	86423	86423	He	2255	“ You want me to stop asking ? Come up here and shut me up , then . ”
86518	86532	86510	86510	His	2255	“ I ’m so tired . Kiss me again before I fall asleep . ”
86806	86810	86797	86797	she	153	“ dumb jock . ”
86921	86927	86928	86928	she	141	“ Everything okay back there ? ”
86932	86937	86928	86928	she	141	“ Mmm - hmm . ”

88266	88282	88263	88263	she	151	“ That ’s a funny thing to say when you ’ve been out all night . ”
88293	88324	88285	88285	Elsa	151	“ You know what I mean . If I do marry Lauren someday , she will live here . I would n’t have to go somewhere else to see her . ”
88379	88382	88383	88383	he	143	“ Look , ”

89077	89081	89070	89070	She	141	“ Hi there . ”
89082	89093	89094	89094	He	139	“ Hi yourself . Missing you like crazy right now . ”

89129	89139	89070	89070	She	141	“ It ’s not great . How ’s Manhattan ? ”
89140	89162	89070	89070	She	141	“ The usual . It ’s Sunday , though . So I ’m working at home instead of at my desk . ”
89163	89171	89115	89115	They	2292	“ Ah . Wish I were there . ”
89172	89175	89176	89176	she	141	“ Soon , ”

89203	89206	89115	89115	They	2292	“ Shoot . ”
89207	89224	89225	89225	She	141	“ Any chance you ’re coming to Detroit for game seven ? A guy can dream . ”
89228	89252	89225	89225	She	141	“ I ’m not traveling with the team , if that ’s what you ’re asking . That ’s Becca ’s job again . ”
89253	89278	89115	89115	They	2292	“ They sell plane tickets at the airport , though . I ’ve heard that ’s a thing . Can I buy you one ? ”
89279	89305	89115	89115	They	2292	“ Do I get an hour to think about it ? I need to look at tomorrow ’s schedule and see what I can rearrange . ”
89306	89332	89225	89225	She	141	“ Of course . And , honey — if it ’s really not good timing , you can say so . I just miss you . ”
89333	89348	89115	89115	They	2292	“ I miss you , too . And I love to watch you play . ”
89349	89368	89115	89115	They	2292	“ Take a look and let me know . Either way , we ’ll get our chance soon . ”

89390	89395	89396	89396	he	2306	“ I love you , ”
89417	89438	89439	89439	His	2306	“ I love you , too . Now let me get some work done and I ’ll call you later . ”
89504	89512	89492	89492	He	155	“ What ’s the matter , bud ? ”
89533	89536	89524	89524	Hans	155	“ Nothing . ”
89537	89548	89549	89549	Hans	155	“ Is it auditions ? Or is Justin the problem ? ”
89556	89563	89553	89553	his	155	“ Neither . Just poor timing . ”
89564	89573	89574	89574	he	155	“ I ’m the king of poor timing , ”
89579	89585	89574	89574	he	155	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
89586	89603	89553	89553	his	155	“ It does n’t matter . I do n’t want to add stress to your week . ”
89619	89624	89553	89553	his	155	“ Just try me . ”
89625	89655	89553	89553	his	155	“ Got a text about a really neat gig , but I ca n’t do it . They want me to sub for one of the musicians in Hamilton . ”
89656	89659	89660	89660	Elsa	151	“ Hamilton ? ”
89667	89681	89660	89660	Elsa	151	“ Really ? That ’s so cool ! You have to do it ! ”
89682	89687	89688	89688	Mike	143	“ When is it ? ”
89691	89706	89688	89688	Mike	143	“ Tomorrow night . But they ’ll probably call me again some other time . ”
89715	89720	89721	89721	Hans	155	“ Oh , shit . ”
89762	89773	89774	89774	Elsa	151	“ I ’ll stay home in New York with Hans , ”
89785	89806	89778	89778	Hans	155	“ You have to see the game . It ’s okay . They ’ll give me another chance to sub . ”
89807	89836	89846	89846	his	155	“ No ! This is big ! And you told me Broadway pays really well . I ’ll go with you tomorrow night and wait in the lobby . ”
89837	89842	89843	89843	Hans	155	“ Oh , Elsabelle , ”
89850	89866	89843	89843	Hans	155	“ It ’s four hours . I appreciate your sacrifices but that ’s not practical . ”
89867	89874	89875	89875	Mike	143	“ I have a better idea , ”
89878	89900	89875	89875	Mike	143	“ Can you all give me a few minutes ? Hans — you did n’t turn it down yet , right ? ”
89907	89920	89904	89904	his	1195	“ Just give me an hour . I might have a solution . ”
90136	90144	90145	90145	she	141	“ Shall we go out for dinner ? ”
90170	90191	90145	90145	she	141	“ Or we could eat whatever concessions they have at the rink , but that ’s not for two hours . ”
90192	90199	90200	90200	Elsa	151	“ I ’m not very hungry , ”
90203	90208	90200	90200	Elsa	151	“ We can wait . ”
90241	90257	90258	90258	Lauren	141	“ The puck drops at seven thirty , so we have a couple of hours , ”
90264	90284	90258	90258	Lauren	141	“ We ’ll leave at seven ? We can either walk through the convention center or ride the shuttle . ”
90285	90288	90291	90291	Lauren	141	“ Fine . ”
90316	90328	90329	90329	she	141	“ I ’ll just be through here if you need anything , ”
90644	90657	90632	90632	she	141	“ Honey ? Will you be ready to go in thirty minutes ? ”
90836	90855	90829	90829	She	141	“ Elsa , please open the door . I ’m going to come in either way , okay ? ”
90932	90949	90926	90926	Lauren	141	“ Elsa ? Could n’t you hear my knocking ? It ’s almost time to go . ”
90987	91000	90982	90982	She	141	“ Elsa ? Are you okay ? Can you open the door ? ”
91001	91008	90982	90982	She	141	“ N . . . no . ”
91020	91025	90982	90982	She	141	“ Are you ill ? ”
91026	91031	91032	91032	Lauren	141	“ I . . . ”
91037	91051	91032	91032	Lauren	141	“ Honey ? You ’re scaring me . Open the door , please . ”
91052	91057	90982	90982	She	141	“ I ca n’t . ”
91058	91065	91066	91066	Her	141	“ You ca n’t ? Why ? ”
91131	91136	91137	91137	She	141	“ Open this door . ”
91149	91158	91159	91159	Lauren	141	“ God ! Just go the fuck away ! ”
91241	91337	91235	91235	she	141	“ Hi , honey . Hope your pregame routine is going well . I do n’t want you to worry , but Elsa wo n’t come out of her bathroom . As a precaution I ’d love to know if she ’s been feeling ill . But I suspect that she ’s fine and just pushing my buttons a little bit . If you have any intel , shoot me a text . Otherwise I ’ll talk her out of there in a bit and we ’ll both be cheering for you . Love you . ”
91409	91412	91413	91413	she	141	“ Honey , ”
91419	91452	91413	91413	she	141	“ If you wo n’t tell me the problem , or come out of there , I ’m going to have to call maintenance and get them to open it for me . ”
91453	91456	91457	91457	Elsa	151	“ No ! ”
91476	91479	91480	91480	Lauren	141	“ Why ? ”
91547	91555	91533	91533	Elsa	151	“ I have a p - problem . ”
91556	91562	91563	91563	Lauren	141	“ What kind of problem ? ”
91566	91575	91563	91563	Lauren	141	“ There ’s . . . blood everywhere . ”
91576	91579	91580	91580	Lauren	141	“ What ? ”
91666	91673	91674	91674	Elsa	151	“ You just got your period ? ”
91693	91699	91700	91701	The child	2367	“ For the first time ? ”
91711	91714	91715	91715	Lauren	141	“ Oh , ”
91719	91729	91715	91715	Lauren	141	“ Oh , honey . That must be scary . ”
91736	91739	91740	91740	Lauren	141	“ Hey ! ”
91748	91757	91740	91740	Lauren	141	“ You ’re okay ! You ’re fine . ”
91778	91783	91762	91762	she	141	“ Breathe , okay ? ”
91784	91792	91793	91793	Elsa	151	“ It ’s . . . everywhere , ”
91796	91804	91805	91805	Lauren	141	“ It looks worse than it is , ”
91808	91827	91805	91805	Lauren	141	“ Just a little mess . You ’re just surprised , right ? Did it start earlier today ? ”
91828	91868	91762	91762	she	141	“ I . . . I guess . I saw some . . . brown in the airport . And then I shut the TV off and got up and . . . and . . . it gushed . ”
91869	91874	91875	91875	Lauren	141	“ Okay , okay , ”
91878	91906	91875	91875	Lauren	141	“ You ’re fine . I know you feel scared , because it seems weird to see a lot of blood . But this is totally normal . ”
91923	91929	91930	91930	Elsa	151	“ I want my mom , ”
91947	91963	91964	91964	She	141	“ Oh , honey . I ’m so , so sorry she is n’t here . ”
91970	92022	91964	91964	She	141	“ Let ’s get you cleaned up . I ’m going to help you the best I can . I know it ’s not nearly the same as having your mom around , but I ’ve gotten periods for a long time , okay ? I ’ll get you set up . ”
92023	92026	92027	92027	Elsa	151	“ Okay , ”
92087	92126	92073	92073	she	141	“ You can just throw your ruined ones away , okay ? I have extras . And we ’ll use cold water to get the stain out of your jeans . Do you have another pair with you ? ”
92195	92213	92185	92185	She	141	“ I got my first period on a bus trip with my class . In eighth grade . ”
92214	92219	92220	92220	Elsa	151	“ Oh , no ! ”
92223	92264	92265	92265	Elsa	151	“ It was on the way home , at least . I tied my sweatshirt around my waist . But I was still a hundred percent sure that everyone saw . I felt like I was glowing like a beacon . ”
92289	92318	92319	92319	Elsa	151	“ We ’ll buy some pads in the hotel gift shop on our way to the game , all right ? I ’ll stash them in my purse . ”
92328	92332	92333	92333	she	151	“ Thank you , ”
92337	92404	92333	92333	she	151	“ It ’s nothing , honey . I know it seems like a huge deal today . But you get really good at handling the details , and life goes on . You can ask me for anything , okay ? One of these days you ’ll be ready to handle tampons , which makes life even easier . But today is probably not that day . ”
92405	92410	92411	92411	Elsa	151	“ Ew , no , ”
92460	92464	92465	92465	he	143	“ What happened ? ”
92476	92486	92472	92472	Lauren	141	“ You ’re supposed to be at the rink ! ”
92487	92520	92441	92441	Mike	143	“ No kidding ! But I got a call from you on my phone that there ’s some kind of crisis . I texted you back a hundred times with no answer . ”
92521	92524	92525	92525	Lauren	141	“ Omigod , ”
92532	92547	92525	92525	Lauren	141	“ The message I left ! I ’m so sorry . We ’re fine . ”
92548	92553	92554	92554	He	143	“ Looks that way . ”
92562	92571	92554	92554	He	143	“ Jesus . Ran all the way here . ”
92572	92579	92580	92580	Elsa	151	“ I ’m sorry , Daddy , ”
92584	92595	92596	92596	He	143	“ You ’d better get back . Like , yesterday . ”
92605	92620	92596	92596	He	143	“ You two sure you ’re okay ? Want to tell me what happened ? ”
92621	92624	92625	92625	Lauren	141	“ Later , ”
92634	92643	92632	92632	Elsa	151	“ Young lady , were you causing drama ? ”
92671	92689	92668	92668	Elsa	151	“ I would n’t come out of the bathroom because I got , uh , my period . ”
92705	92708	92709	92709	he	143	“ Oh , ”
92713	92722	92709	92709	he	143	“ Uh , okay . And . . . ”
92728	92739	92723	92723	He	143	“ Is that , uh , working out all right ? ”
92740	92743	92744	92744	Elsa	151	“ Yup , ”
92748	92759	92744	92744	Elsa	151	“ You can go back to guarding the net now . ”
92760	92763	92764	92764	he	143	“ Right , ”
92767	92770	92771	92771	Lauren	141	“ Right , ”
92774	92787	92788	92788	He	143	“ So . . . I ’m just going to . . . ”
92794	92799	92800	92800	Elsa	151	“ Stop ’em all , ”
92803	92807	92808	92808	Lauren	141	“ Stay sharp , ”
92838	92841	92842	92842	Lauren	141	“ Whoops , ”
92848	92851	92852	92852	Elsa	151	“ Yeah , ”
92855	92861	92852	92852	Elsa	151	“ Did you . . . ”
92871	92882	92868	92868	her	151	“ . . . see the look on his face ? ”
92883	92887	92888	92888	Lauren	141	“ I did . ”
92902	92911	92912	92912	Elsa	151	“ He was like , oh , omigod , ”
92915	92921	92922	92922	Lauren	141	“ Any topic but that , ”
92943	92954	92922	92922	Lauren	141	“ We should go or we ’ll miss the beginning . ”
92955	92958	92959	92959	Elsa	151	“ Okay . ”
92974	92985	92966	92966	She	151	“ Do you feel okay ? Does your stomach hurt ? ”
92986	92997	92922	92922	Lauren	141	“ It did earlier but I think I ’m good . ”
93015	93027	93028	93028	Elsa	151	“ Are you going to , uh , ask for them ? ”
93035	93070	93028	93028	Elsa	151	“ Sure . Do n’t forget — every woman buys these . And if there are men at the checkout counter of Rite Aid at home , that ’s what self checkout is for . ”
93071	93076	93077	93077	Lauren	141	“ Huh . Okay . ”
93090	93103	93077	93077	Lauren	141	“ Do you have maxi pads ? I need them very badly . ”
93104	93109	93110	93110	Elsa	151	“ Omigod , Lauren , ”
93113	93116	93110	93110	Elsa	151	“ Shhh . ”
93146	93151	93152	93152	she	1975	“ Six - fifty , ”
93180	93193	93194	93195	The doorman	2236	“ There ’s supposed to be a shuttle bus to the game . ”
93203	93229	93194	93195	The doorman	2236	“ It ’s running slow tonight because there ’s a protest rally going on . Give it ten minutes . Or you could walk it . ”
93230	93233	93234	93234	Lauren	141	“ Thanks , ”
93241	93246	93234	93234	Lauren	141	“ Shuttle or walk ? ”
93247	93250	93239	93239	Elsa	151	“ Walk . ”
93331	93340	93341	93342	the driver	630	“ Seems to be some kind of rally , ”
93345	93358	93341	93342	the driver	630	“ I ca n’t turn left at any of these cross streets . ”
93359	93362	93363	93363	His	143	“ Shit . ”
93579	93596	93568	93568	He	143	“ Which way is the arena ? I ’m going to have to run for it . ”
93597	93611	93568	93568	He	143	“ I apologize , sir . You have good seats for the game ? ”
93612	93618	93568	93568	He	143	“ You could say that . ”
93619	93623	93624	93625	The man	430	“ That way . ”
93628	93645	93624	93625	The man	430	“ We ’re three blocks north . You ’ll see it when you clear those blocks . ”
93646	93649	93650	93650	Beacon	143	“ Thanks , ”
93685	93691	93667	93667	He	143	“ What the actual fuck ? ”
93696	93701	93702	93702	he	143	“ I ’m sorry , ”
93742	93747	93732	93732	His	143	“ Where were you ? ”
93748	93759	93760	93760	Coach	2845	“ It does n’t matter . I ’m here now . ”
93764	93793	93760	93760	Coach	2845	“ It does matter . I had to turn in the starting lineup ten minutes ago . I put Silas on it because nobody could find your ass . ”
93803	93819	93798	93798	He	143	“ Okay . So Silas starts for a shift or two . Where is he ? ”
93820	93823	93732	93732	His	143	“ Stretching . ”
93828	93845	93826	93826	Beacon	143	“ The last time Silas started a game he did n’t get any notice , either . ”
93846	93850	93851	93851	Coach	139	“ I recall , ”
93861	93866	93867	93867	Beacon	143	“ The thing is ? ”
93874	93893	93867	93867	Beacon	143	“ This is a disruption for the other team , too . They wo n’t be expecting Silas . ”
93899	93945	93894	93894	O’Doul	134	“ I thought about that . They might take it as an opportunity — drop everything and rush the net . If they think Beak is injured , it will change their whole game . Beak ’s fine , but they wo n’t believe it . ”
93946	93961	93962	93962	Coach	139	“ Because only idiots would put in their backup guy to start game seven , ”
93977	93980	93972	93972	he	139	“ Yeah , ”
93984	93999	93981	93981	Doulie	174	“ Putting Silas in is n’t something you ’d do unless you were desperate . ”
94000	94013	94014	94014	Beacon	143	“ Unless your goalie went fucking MIA at the worst possible moment . ”
94041	94058	94059	94059	Doulie	174	“ Let ’s just ride this for a little while and see how Silas holds up , ”
94062	94106	94059	94059	Doulie	174	“ Beak will take his time getting ready . Silas starts . If he gets into trouble , Beak steps in immediately . But in the meantime , the front line is gon na play hard and try to capitalize on the confusion . ”
94220	94226	94227	94227	Coach	139	“ Let ’s talk strategy , ”
94230	94243	94227	94227	Coach	139	“ Where ’s Beringer ? Castro ! Trevi ! Get over here . ”
94271	94274	94275	94275	Silas	169	“ Finally , ”
94284	94290	94275	94275	Silas	169	“ Do n’t get up . ”
94313	94324	94325	94325	Silas	169	“ Are we gon na make out here or what ? ”
94328	94362	94325	94325	Silas	169	“ I get that you ’re pissed at me for doing a runner . But you ’re still between the pipes when the game starts . Sorry you did n’t get any notice . ”
94368	94391	94363	94363	Silas	169	“ My name is on the card , huh ? So Coach has to put me in for a couple of minutes . ”
94392	94403	94325	94325	Silas	169	“ Yeah , but I want you in there longer . ”
94404	94410	94411	94411	Beacon	143	“ What the hell for ? ”
94421	94447	94411	94411	Beacon	143	“ To guard the net , moron . Since you ’re on the card , Detroit thinks there ’s something wrong with me , right ? ”
94448	94452	94453	94453	Beacon	143	“ Is there ? ”
94458	94514	94455	94455	his	143	“ No . I had a little freak - out thinking something was wrong with my kid . And I thought the hotel was closer than it really was . It ’s a long , boring story . But I got us into this weird situation so Doulie wants to have some fun with it . ”
94515	94526	94527	94527	Beacon	143	“ It ’s only fun until someone loses a goal . ”
94530	94556	94527	94527	Beacon	143	“ You ’re going to get scored on tonight . So am I , probably . But you ’re going to get scored on first . ”
94557	94562	94455	94455	his	143	“ Oh , joy . ”
94563	94569	94527	94527	Beacon	143	“ I ’m not kidding . ”
94583	94662	94577	94577	Silas	169	“ You ’re starting this game . And there ’s gon na be an ugly moment when you ca n’t hold them off . The lamp is gon na light behind you and it ’s going to feel like shit . Your job is to make sure that happens later instead of sooner . That ’s all . You ’re playing until one goal gets through . Game seven in the play - offs . Make it count . ”
94663	94666	94667	94667	Silas	169	“ Okay . ”
94674	94678	94670	94670	his	169	“ All right . ”
94679	94683	94684	94684	Beacon	143	“ Good man . ”
94692	94709	94684	94684	Beacon	143	“ Detroit is going to assume either that you ’re injured or that we ’re insane . ”
94710	94737	94670	94670	his	169	“ They ’ll think whatever they think . Just do what you ’ve been doing in practice , bud . This is gon na be fun . ”
94738	94747	94748	94748	He	143	“ Wonder if my mom is watching tonight . ”
94754	94760	94748	94748	He	143	“ It will be interesting . ”
94761	94766	94768	94768	Hugh	193	“ Let ’s go ! ”
94773	94780	94768	94768	Hugh	193	“ On the ice , Silas . ”
94781	94786	94787	94787	Beacon	143	“ You got this ! ”
94793	94806	94807	94807	Silas	169	“ I ’ll be on the bench just after the game starts . ”
95069	95073	95074	95074	Silas	169	“ To Crikey ! ”
95195	95198	95199	95199	Beacon	143	“ Yeah ! ”
95252	95257	95258	95258	Trevi	175	“ He looks solid , ”
95267	95273	95274	95274	Beacon	143	“ Yeah , he does , ”
95414	95418	95419	95419	Coach	139	“ Well played ! ”
95422	95428	95419	95419	Coach	139	“ How ’d that feel ? ”
95433	95455	95456	95456	Silas	169	“ Felt great . You said I was gon na be scored on tonight , but I think you were wrong . ”
95469	95472	95456	95456	Silas	169	“ Yeah ? ”
95473	95513	95514	95514	He	169	“ If anyone ’s getting scored on , it ’s you . Coach would be crazy not to send you in now that we have the momentum . They wo n’t know what hit ’em . Better keep stretching . ”
95530	95535	95536	95536	he	143	“ Ya miss me ? ”
95545	95556	95557	95557	Detroit	45	“ Thought I got a night without your ugly mug , ”
95562	95567	95568	95568	Beacon	143	“ Not so much ! ”
95634	95641	95642	95642	he	143	“ Mighta been something I ate , ”
95659	95667	95642	95642	he	143	“ I freaked out and went AWOL . ”
95724	95727	95728	95728	she	141	“ Hi , ”
95731	95736	95728	95728	she	141	“ Hi , beautiful . ”
95809	95812	95813	95813	she	513	“ Whoa , ”
95827	95835	95813	95813	she	513	“ Somebody ’s happy to see me . ”
95836	95842	95864	95864	he	143	“ You have no idea . ”
95876	95903	95864	95864	he	143	“ Thank you for taking care of my girl tonight . She got her period , huh ? I do n’t think that ever happened before . ”
95904	95909	95910	95910	Lauren	141	“ It had n’t , ”
95914	95936	95910	95910	Lauren	141	“ And it ’s pretty freaky the first time . Seeing your own blood does n’t seem normal , you know ? ”
95937	95944	95945	95945	he	143	“ Except at the hockey rink , ”
95948	95967	95945	95945	he	143	“ No , but seriously . Hans and I would n’t have been nearly so helpful with that . ”
95968	95975	95976	95976	Lauren	141	“ Right place , right time , ”
95992	96006	95980	95980	He	143	“ I love you both so much . How were your seats tonight ? ”
96007	96032	96033	96033	He	143	“ They were great . Except Elsa thinks we ’re due a partial refund because you did n’t play a third of the time . ”
96040	96045	96033	96033	He	143	“ Sorry to disappoint . ”
96046	96055	96056	96056	she	513	“ Was it bad that you were late ? ”
96063	96071	96056	96056	she	513	“ Are they going to fine you ? ”
96072	96085	96086	96086	He	143	“ I really have no idea . What ’s done is done . ”
96095	96104	96086	96086	He	143	“ Speaking of things getting done . . . ”
96105	96109	96086	96086	He	143	“ Smooth transition . ”
96110	96116	96117	96117	He	143	“ I know , right ? ”
96138	96141	96142	96142	Lauren	141	“ Mmm , ”
96148	96154	96142	96142	Lauren	141	“ I love game night . ”
96191	96194	96195	96195	he	143	“ Lo , ”
96200	96206	96195	96195	he	143	“ Did you test yet ? ”
96212	96220	96207	96207	She	513	“ Did you pee on the stick ? ”
96228	96245	96223	96223	she	513	“ I could run out and buy one right now . It ’s time , right ? ”
96256	96260	96251	96251	she	513	“ Do n’t . ”
96261	96264	96251	96251	she	513	“ Why ? ”
96275	96302	96269	96269	she	513	“ In the first place , if you ’re buying a pregnancy test at midnight , it ’s going to end up in the gossip columns . ”
96311	96322	96305	96305	his	143	“ But . . . I ’m just not ready . ”
96328	96346	96347	96347	He	143	“ Why , honey ? Do n’t you want to know ? I ’m dyin ’ here . ”
96356	96364	96365	96365	she	513	“ Lots of pregnancies do n’t take , ”
96375	96381	96365	96365	she	513	“ Thing is . . . ”
96390	96447	96382	96382	He	143	“ We can keep trying . As many times as it takes . With lots of practice in between . And even if it never works , I ’m still so fucking happy that you ’re here . It ’s not just about the baby , Lo . Tell me we ’re on the same page . ”
96456	96477	96448	96448	Her	513	“ It ’s not just about the baby . I love you . I ’m in this no matter what . ”
96522	96526	96527	96527	he	143	“ Thank you , ”
96530	96540	96527	96527	he	143	“ I think I really needed to hear that . ”
96541	96546	96547	96547	She	513	“ You ’re welcome . ”
96561	96573	96574	96574	Lauren	141	“ So now you ’ll pee on the stick , right ? ”
96577	96584	96574	96574	Lauren	141	“ One track mind , much ? ”
96585	96613	96614	96614	She	513	“ But if we know we belong together , then why wait to find out if there ’ll be a baby joining this party in the winter ? ”
96623	96652	96614	96614	She	513	“ Because if we get the plus sign now , then it ’s something I could lose , instead of something I never had in the first place . ”
96653	96658	96659	96659	He	143	“ Aw , baby . ”
96668	96748	96659	96659	He	143	“ It ’s all risk . Every damn thing in my life is something I could lose . That ’s why we have to celebrate what we ’ve got . We ’re here , and we ’re healthy . Everyone I care about is in this building tonight . My team just won . We might be losers again in three days ’ time . Any number of shitty things might happen . But tonight we celebrate the living . ”
96749	96752	96753	96753	She	513	“ You . ”
96767	96777	96755	96755	her	513	“ You always shake me out of my funk . ”
96778	96786	96787	96787	He	143	“ That ’s my job , baby . ”
96858	96876	96877	96877	She	513	“ Are you sure I ca n’t go buy a test ? I ’ll wear a disguise . ”
96880	96893	96877	96877	She	513	“ You ’re not going to let this go , are you ? ”
96894	96899	96853	96853	He	143	“ Not a chance . ”
96900	96910	96853	96853	He	143	“ I have a pregnancy test in my suitcase . ”
96911	96914	96915	96915	he	143	“ What ? ”
96928	96939	96915	96915	he	143	“ You were holding out on me this whole time ? ”
96940	96949	96957	96957	he	143	“ Maybe if you were n’t so pushy . ”
96997	97006	97007	97007	he	143	“ You like it when I ’m pushy , ”
97021	97038	97007	97007	he	143	“ If you add ‘ when we ’re naked ’ to that sentence , then yes . ”
97039	97059	97060	97060	She	513	“ Go pee on the stick , woman , and I ’ll show you my best pushy naked game . ”
97106	97116	97096	97096	she	513	“ You do n’t get to watch me pee . ”
97117	97136	97137	97137	She	513	“ Just do n’t leave me hanging . How long does it take to show us the love ? ”
97277	97284	97285	97285	Mike	143	“ Nine , ten , eleven , ”
97293	97299	97285	97285	Mike	143	“ What are you doing ? ”
97300	97317	97318	97318	Lauren	141	“ The instructions say to wait thirty seconds . Twelve , thirteen , fourteen . . . ”
97323	97351	97352	97352	She	141	“ This is going to be very anticlimactic if it ’s negative . And we wo n’t even know , because false negatives are common early on . ”
97370	97377	97378	97378	he	143	“ Sixteen , seventeen , eighteen , ”
97392	97397	97382	97382	His	143	“ Nineteen . . . ”
97408	97413	97414	97414	He	143	“ Mmm . . . ”
97473	97485	97468	97468	He	143	“ Twenty - nine , thirty ! Let me see it . ”
97501	97506	97486	97486	She	141	“ You ’re insane . ”
97507	97516	97517	97517	He	143	“ So ? It ’s probably not hereditary . ”
97535	97538	97539	97539	He	143	“ Yesss ! ”
97544	97547	97541	97541	his	143	“ Really ? ”
97551	97556	97557	97557	She	141	“ Let me see . ”
97573	97582	97557	97557	She	141	“ Wow . That ’s a plus sign ! ”
97583	97589	97590	97590	He	143	“ Of course it is . ”
97645	97652	97653	97653	he	143	“ Time for my victory lap , ”
97680	97687	97688	97688	she	141	“ I ca n’t believe it , ”
97721	97727	97728	97728	He	143	“ Believe it , honey . ”
97788	97799	97800	97800	She	141	“ Ca n’t believe it worked on the first try . ”
97812	97823	97824	97824	he	143	“ I should have been a forward , you know ? ”
97831	97839	97824	97824	he	143	“ I ’m a really good shot . ”
97870	97873	97874	97874	she	141	“ Oh , ”
97899	97903	97904	97904	he	143	“ I know , ”
97908	97917	97904	97904	he	143	“ We have to be a little quiet . ”
97935	97940	97941	97941	she	141	“ Come up here , ”
97944	97950	97951	97951	He	143	“ Now who ’s pushy ? ”
97965	97968	97969	97969	she	141	“ Please , ”
98000	98004	98005	98005	he	143	“ Oh yeah , ”
98014	98026	98005	98005	he	143	“ I do good work . First rate . Pro level . ”
98094	98098	98099	98099	she	141	“ Kiss me , ”
98265	98268	98239	98239	Beacon	143	“ Four ? ”
98269	98297	98239	98239	Beacon	143	“ I want Lauren to join us . Make it five if Justin is free . And pick up a bottle of whatever you feel like drinking . ”
98298	98304	98305	98305	Hans	155	“ What does Lauren drink ? ”
98313	98319	98305	98305	Hans	155	“ Anything . You pick . ”
98320	98325	98326	98326	Hans	155	“ Sounds like fun , ”
98329	98353	98326	98326	Hans	155	“ I ’ll make that pasta salad that Elsa likes , with the olives in it . She ’s a little blue today . ”
98354	98358	98359	98359	He	155	“ She is ? ”
98371	98376	98359	98359	He	155	“ Any idea why ? ”
98377	98404	98326	98326	Hans	155	“ I asked , but she would not say . Even my offer to play Bach duets at twice the normal speed did not cheer her . ”
98405	98408	98326	98326	Hans	155	“ Shit . ”
98409	98434	98359	98359	He	155	“ You ’re coming home , though . She ’ll like that . I ’ll tell her to finish up the math homework now . ”
98435	98444	98445	98445	Beacon	143	“ Thanks , man . See you soon . ”
98464	98471	98472	98472	he	155	“ Willow Street in Brooklyn Heights , ”
98485	98489	98490	98490	he	155	“ Team huddle , ”
98496	98504	98505	98505	she	141	“ What ’s the play , Coach ? ”
98509	98539	98505	98505	she	141	“ Any chance you can come to dinner at my place ? I would have asked sooner but this was a plan I hatched at thirty - thousand feet . ”
98540	98554	98474	98475	the driver	630	“ I could probably make a little room in my busy social calendar . ”
98555	98577	98578	98578	She	141	“ Then I ’m honored . Bring a change of clothes , maybe ? I ’d like to keep you overnight . ”
98584	98594	98578	98578	She	141	“ If you think Elsa ’s ready for that . ”
98595	98632	98474	98475	the driver	630	“ I love that kid so hard , Lo . If she has n’t figured that out by now , I do n’t think another couple weeks of easing her into it is going to help . ”
98633	98659	98474	98475	the driver	630	“ Okay . If I have to stop at home , it will take me until six thirty to get to your place , though . ”
98660	98673	98578	98578	She	141	“ That ’s fine . I ’ll light the grill at six . ”
98674	98685	98474	98475	the driver	630	“ Do you cook other things these days , too ? ”
98686	98712	98474	98475	the driver	630	“ Nope . Just steak and pancakes . Same as always . You ’ll have to be the one who teaches the twins to cook . ”
98713	98730	98578	98578	She	141	“ You think you ’re so funny . Until the doctor says I ’m having twins . ”
98731	98753	98754	98754	They	2468	“ Bring it , woman . Now go back to work so I can make you a steak at six thirty . ”
98792	98804	98774	98774	he	2469	“ Sweetie , I ’m home . Can I come in ? ”
98810	98813	98814	98814	He	2469	“ Els ? ”
98840	98847	98819	98819	She	151	“ Hey — are you okay ? ”
98858	98862	98863	98863	He	2469	“ What happened ? ”
98887	98897	98863	98863	He	2469	“ I . . . read Mom ’s letter . ”
98910	98913	98914	98914	he	2469	“ Oh , ”
98930	98940	98907	98907	she	151	“ I ’ll bet she said some nice things . ”
98941	98944	98945	98945	she	151	“ Yeah , ”
98952	98957	98958	98958	She	151	“ But . . . ”
99195	99211	99182	99182	He	154	“ I ’m sorry , honey . I ’m sure that was hard to read . ”
99244	99249	99250	99250	Elsa	151	“ It ’s okay , ”
99255	99272	99250	99250	Elsa	151	“ Would now be a bad time to mention that Lauren is coming over for dinner ? ”
99303	99333	99285	99285	Mike	143	“ Your mom was a good person , okay ? Only a good person can own up to her worst mistakes like that . It was brave of her . ”
99334	99340	99341	99341	Elsa	151	“ I kn - know , ”
99344	99350	99341	99341	Elsa	151	“ What did yours say ? ”
99351	99354	99355	99355	He	143	“ What ? ”
99386	99393	99378	99378	Elsa	151	“ What did your letter say ? ”
99394	99402	99341	99341	Elsa	151	“ I did n’t read it yet . ”
99403	99424	99425	99425	He	143	“ Really ? Are n’t you curious ? Mine was , like , burning a hole in my desk drawer . ”
99428	99439	99425	99425	He	143	“ I ’ll read it if you want me to . ”
99453	99457	99458	99458	Mike	143	“ Do it . ”
99591	99594	99586	99586	He	143	“ What ? ”
99722	99731	99734	99734	he	143	“ Oh , Daddy ! What is it ? ”
99769	99774	99757	99757	she	151	“ Oh , man . ”
99781	99788	99789	99789	Elsa	151	“ She was a good person , ”
99799	99806	99807	99807	he	143	“ That was never in doubt , ”
99810	99832	99807	99807	he	143	“ Marriage is hard . Things were complicated with us . It was n’t all your mom ’s fault , either . ”
99845	99852	99836	99836	her	513	“ I ’m never getting married . ”
99853	99867	99807	99807	he	143	“ Uh - huh . I ’ll remind you of this conversation someday . ”
99868	99875	99807	99807	he	143	“ Is Lauren really coming over ? ”
99876	99886	99836	99836	her	513	“ She is , sweetie . I invited her . ”
99887	99901	99807	99807	he	143	“ Okay . Then I have to go wash my face and change . ”
99902	99907	99807	99807	he	143	“ Nah . Why ? ”
99908	99922	99923	99923	He	143	“ She always looks so freaking perfect . She has the best clothes . ”
99926	99948	99923	99923	He	143	“ Lauren likes to shop , kid . You play your cards right , she ’ll take you with her sometime . ”
99955	99980	99949	99949	Elsa	151	“ Do n’t try to butter me up , okay ? I hate it . I can see you coming from a mile away . ”
99990	100003	100004	100005	His daughter	513	“ You should play hockey . Center , or maybe right wing . ”
100142	100160	100129	100129	Hans	155	“ That is life in the arts . You are always scrambling to make a good impression . ”
100161	100170	100171	100171	Elsa	151	“ You ’re going to win this one , ”
100180	100186	100171	100171	Elsa	151	“ I just know it . ”
100295	100335	100283	100283	Elsa	151	“ Hey , I have something for you in my bag . But do n’t get excited , it ’s just three kinds of pads . I thought you could try the different styles and see what worked best . ”
100336	100344	100345	100346	The girl	1941	“ Oh ! Thank you . Really . ”
100380	100389	100390	100390	Lauren	141	“ My bag is in the living room , ”
100400	100418	100390	100390	Lauren	141	“ They ’re right inside the main compartment — grab them now while the coast is clear . ”
100451	100456	100457	100457	Mike	143	“ Steaks are ready ! ”
100479	100487	100472	100472	He	143	“ Okay . I ’m done here . ”
100560	100563	100564	100564	Mike	143	“ Elsa ! ”
100570	100573	100574	100574	He	143	“ Dinner ! ”
100617	100629	100630	100630	She	141	“ Els ! Did you hear me ? Dinner is ready ! ”
100640	100645	100646	100646	Mike	143	“ Let ’s start , ”
100653	100671	100646	100646	Mike	143	“ We ca n’t let the food get cold just because somebody is on her own clock . ”
100770	100778	100779	100779	Mike	143	“ Good of you to join us , ”
100843	100852	100853	100853	Justin	157	“ What do you think of this wine ? ”
100861	100877	100853	100853	Justin	157	“ I do n’t usually go in for Malbec , but the wine guy raved . ”
100878	100883	100884	100884	Mike	143	“ It ’s spicy , ”
100887	100892	100884	100884	Mike	143	“ I like it . ”
100893	100899	100900	100900	Hans	155	“ And I like everything , ”
100903	100922	100900	100900	Hans	155	“ He always goes on about the nose or the terroir , and I just nod and smile . ”
100923	100930	100931	100931	Justin	157	“ That ’s okay , honey , ”
100940	100947	100931	100931	Justin	157	“ I like a cheap date . ”
100964	100973	100974	100974	she	151	“ What do you think of the wine ? ”
101121	101133	101134	101134	Mike	143	“ Maybe Lauren is n’t in the mood to drink tonight , ”
101138	101148	101149	101149	Elsa	151	“ Is that how you want to play it ? ”
101158	101167	101152	101152	She	151	“ When did you plan to tell me ? ”
101168	101173	101174	101174	Mike	143	“ Uh - oh , ”
101180	101186	101187	101187	Lauren	141	“ When I was sure , ”
101190	101196	101187	101187	Lauren	141	“ It is n’t personal . ”
101197	101204	101205	101205	Elsa	151	“ Just do me one favor ? ”
101224	101313	101205	101205	Elsa	151	“ If the baby was an accident , do n’t ever let it know , okay ? Do n’t let it hear its grandparents tell their neighbors that its daddy got its mother knocked up at eighteen . Do n’t let the wives in the clubhouse whisper about how young they had you . And do n’t end up apologizing to your kid for cheating on each other , okay ? Because the baby will not want to hear that she was the source of all your woe . ”
101376	101387	101369	101369	He	143	“ Thanks a crap ton , Shelly . Nice timing ! ”
101388	101391	101392	101392	Lauren	141	“ What ? ”
101407	101444	101402	101402	He	143	“ I ’ll go talk to her . No — I’ll finish my steak . Then I ’ll go talk to her . Her day has been full of revelations . She just needs a break . ”
101458	101469	101445	101445	He	143	“ So , we ’re having a baby or two . ”
101470	101473	101474	101474	Lauren	141	“ Probably , ”
101477	101482	101474	101474	Lauren	141	“ It ’s early . ”
101483	101486	101487	101487	Hans	155	“ Two ? ”
101497	101513	101490	101490	She	141	“ That ’s his funny little joke . I ’ll settle for one healthy one . ”
101514	101517	101518	101520	the German man	2518	“ Congratulations , ”
101527	101548	101523	101523	his	2518	“ Thank you . You ’re the first person to say that , because I have n’t told a soul . ”
101549	101555	101556	101556	Mike	143	“ And yet . . . ”
101562	101569	101570	101570	Lauren	141	“ That was probably my error , ”
101573	101592	101570	101570	Lauren	141	“ I had her fetch something out of my bag , and I think she saw my vitamins . ”
101593	101599	101600	101600	Mike	143	“ Good going , slick , ”
101607	101616	101600	101600	Mike	143	“ And after you swore me to secrecy . ”
101617	101625	101626	101626	He	143	“ I know ! I ’m sorry . ”
101630	101640	101626	101626	He	143	“ It had to come out at some point . ”
101668	101676	101656	101656	he	143	“ You wo n’t be needing this . ”
101677	101699	101700	101700	He	143	“ Sadly , no . Are you going to have a chat with Elsa ? I do n’t mind doing it . ”
101703	101742	101700	101700	He	143	“ I got it . I ’m giving her a few minutes , first . And I ’m going to eat my steak . Then I ’m going to tell my little girl how much I love her . ”
101743	101751	101754	101754	he	143	“ You ’re very calm about this . ”
101760	101776	101754	101754	he	143	“ Not always . But no goalie has ever had a hundred percent save rate . ”
101777	101780	101700	101700	He	143	“ What ? ”
101781	101791	101792	101792	He	143	“ It ’s just something I tell myself sometimes . ”
101897	101904	101905	101905	Mike	143	“ The pasta salad is excellent , ”
101910	101913	101905	101905	Mike	143	“ Danke . ”
101994	101998	101999	101999	she	151	“ Come in , ”
102050	102060	102061	102061	she	151	“ I should n’t have gone on that rant , ”
102064	102076	102061	102061	she	151	“ But I ’m really having a day , you know ? ”
102077	102082	102083	102083	He	143	“ I do know . ”
102098	102126	102083	102083	He	143	“ You guys never said it out loud , but everyone always whispered about Mom . That she was the pregnant girl at her high school graduation . ”
102127	102131	102132	102132	Mike	143	“ She was , ”
102135	102148	102149	102149	He	143	“ I ’m sure that was n’t easy on her . Look . ”
102196	102222	102223	102223	He	143	“ You were so stinkin ’ cute . I loved it when you and Mom came to the rink so I could show you off . ”
102307	102314	102315	102315	Elsa	151	“ Holy crap we look ridiculous , ”
102330	102346	102323	102323	He	143	“ I love being your dad . Always have . That ’s not an accident . ”
102431	102445	102446	102446	he	143	“ I ’m sorry I did n’t tell you about the baby yet , ”
102449	102458	102446	102446	he	143	“ We only found out six days ago . ”
102465	102468	102459	102459	Elsa	151	“ Really ? ”
102469	102518	102519	102519	Elsa	151	“ Really . And Lauren is worried she ’ll have a miscarriage . That happens a lot , I guess . But if Lauren lost this baby , we ’d try again . It was n’t an accident , just like you and I are n’t an accident . ”
102536	102548	102549	102549	he	143	“ Your mom and I did n’t get our timing right , ”
102553	102601	102549	102549	he	143	“ It did n’t help things between us . But there has never been a single day when I did n’t want to be your dad . And if this baby makes its way into the world next winter , the same will be true for him . ”
102602	102606	102607	102607	Elsa	151	“ Or her , ”
102610	102617	102607	102607	Elsa	151	“ Or her . Or them . ”
102618	102621	102549	102549	he	143	“ Them ? ”
102622	102632	102549	102549	he	143	“ It could be twins . You never know . ”
102633	102638	102639	102639	Elsa	151	“ I like babies , ”
102645	102649	102639	102639	Elsa	151	“ So do I. ”
102658	102680	102650	102650	He	143	“ And grumpy teenagers . Hans put a cover over your plate so your pasta salad wo n’t get dried out . ”
102681	102688	102549	102549	he	143	“ That was nice of him . ”
102689	102695	102639	102639	Elsa	151	“ Yes , it was . ”
102696	102711	102650	102650	He	143	“ If you marry Lauren , Hans will move out , wo n’t he ? ”
102712	102715	102716	102716	Mike	143	“ Probably , ”
102719	102742	102716	102716	Mike	143	“ I do n’t have a road map , Els . Lauren and I have a lot of things to figure out . ”
102743	102750	102751	102751	Elsa	151	“ When are you getting married ? ”
102754	102763	102751	102751	Elsa	151	“ You have to . For the baby . ”
102767	102782	102783	102783	She	151	“ What other advice do you have for me ? Shall I take notes ? ”
102792	102805	102788	102788	he	143	“ Are we still going to France at the end of June ? ”
102806	102809	102810	102810	he	143	“ Absolutely , ”
102837	102844	102829	102829	Elsa	151	“ Is Lauren coming with us ? ”
102852	102908	102829	102829	Elsa	151	“ She has to go on a business trip to China with Nate . By the way — please do n’t tell a soul that Lauren is pregnant , okay ? It ’s too early to tell people . And her boss does n’t know . She ’ll choose the right time to tell him . ”
102909	102928	102977	102977	her	2533	“ China ? Wow . Is Lauren going to keep working for Nate after the baby is born ? ”
102929	102932	102933	102933	he	143	“ Elsa , ”
102936	102943	102933	102933	he	143	“ I do n’t . . . ”
102944	102950	102951	102951	she	2533	“ . . . Know , ”
102954	102972	102951	102951	she	2533	“ Got it . There ’s a lot you do n’t know , though . Just saying . ”
102980	103000	102973	102973	He	143	“ That ’s always been true . Thank you for pointing it out , honey . I love that . ”
103001	103007	103008	103008	Mike	143	“ Just doing my job . ”
103011	103058	103008	103008	Mike	143	“ Can we just take it a day at a time , kid ? Planning has never really worked for me . But do n’t slack off on the French homework because I ’m counting on you to ask directions if we get lost in Paris . ”
103059	103085	103008	103008	Mike	143	“ I ca n’t wait to see Cirque du Soleil , and visit all the cafes . And the shops . And the Tour Eiffel . ”
103086	103103	103008	103008	Mike	143	“ We ’re going to do that right after I win the Stanley Cup , okay ? ”
103104	103115	103008	103008	Mike	143	“ I thought you did n’t like to make plans , ”
103120	103125	103126	103126	He	143	“ Only for that . ”
103153	103158	103126	103126	He	143	“ Daddy stop it ! ”
103159	103162	103163	103163	She	513	“ Nope . ”
103462	103469	103470	103471	her mother	486	“ You looked lovely , dear , ”
103474	103484	103470	103471	her mother	486	“ even if black is n’t really your color . ”
103707	103713	103714	103714	she	141	“ Brooklyn won game four , ”
103727	103747	103720	103721	Her father	375	“ Fucking miracle , then . The new guy is gon na drive that team right into the ground . ”
103756	103760	103753	103753	he	375	“ the new guy ”
103830	103836	103837	103837	she	141	“ I ’m quite tired , ”
103844	103860	103837	103837	she	141	“ Thank you for this lovely meal , but I think I ’ll head home . ”
103861	103867	103868	103870	her elderly grandmother	2554	“ Well done , honey , ”
103880	103894	103895	103896	her mother	486	“ Now if only we could find you a nice , available man , ”
103899	103905	103906	103906	Lauren	141	“ Thank you , gran , ”
103917	103923	103906	103906	Lauren	141	“ That means a lot . ”
103935	103941	103951	103951	his	375	“ This is for you , ”
103954	103957	103951	103951	his	375	“ Congratulations . ”
103958	103962	103963	103963	She	141	“ Thank you . ”
104039	104049	104050	104050	he	143	“ When can I get you to marry me ? ”
104060	104067	104054	104054	Her	141	“ You want to get married ? ”
104068	104074	104075	104075	His	143	“ Of course I do . ”
104083	104111	104075	104075	His	143	“ But I know some women do n’t want to walk down the aisle with a belly . What are your thoughts regarding weddings and baby bumps ? ”
104112	104125	104126	104126	He	143	“ This will be the second time you marry a pregnant wife . ”
104138	104162	104126	104126	He	143	“ The circumstances could n’t be more different . I would have married you beforehand if I thought you would go for it . ”
104169	104190	104163	104163	She	141	“ I know . And I do n’t like weddings all that much , honestly . They ’re so predictable . ”
104199	104205	104191	104191	He	143	“ What do you mean ? ”
104206	104241	104191	104191	He	143	“ White dress . Pachelbel ’s Canon in D. Tiered cake . They ’re all the same , and yet you can just feel how hard everyone labored to try to make it special . ”
104242	104248	104191	104191	He	143	“ I love cynical girls . ”
104249	104253	104191	104191	He	143	“ You must . ”
104254	104270	104191	104191	He	143	“ What ’s the solution , then ? You do n’t want to get married ? ”
104271	104281	104282	104282	she	141	“ I ’d love to be married to you , ”
104285	104299	104282	104282	she	141	“ I do n’t care about the wedding . There ’s always Vegas . ”
104300	104307	104308	104308	he	143	“ God , you ’re fun , ”
104311	104317	104308	104308	he	143	“ We could do that . ”
104318	104341	104342	104342	He	143	“ We could let Elsa pick the venue . The fake Eiffel Tower , or in a helicopter , or by Elvis . ”
104345	104355	104342	104342	He	143	“ The power would go right to her head . ”
104356	104370	104308	104308	he	143	“ I do n’t mind . The venue is n’t important to me . ”
104371	104386	104387	104387	Lauren	141	“ Elsa told me in no uncertain terms that we have to get married . ”
104392	104397	104389	104389	her	141	“ Really ? Why ? ”
104406	104452	104398	104398	His	143	“ I do n’t know her angle , exactly . But I was n’t going to argue until I spoke to you about it . If you want to elope to Vegas , I ’m down with that . Or we could invite our parents . ”
104453	104456	104457	104457	She	141	“ No . ”
104463	104480	104457	104457	She	141	“ Let ’s just go the three of us . Right before training camp , maybe ? ”
104481	104487	104488	104488	he	143	“ The four of us , ”
104498	104501	104488	104488	he	143	“ Aw . ”
104507	104537	104502	104502	She	141	“ Seriously , Lo . I ca n’t wait to make this promise to you and slip a ring on your finger . It means a lot to me . ”
104543	104554	104502	104502	She	141	“ It will mean a lot to me , too . ”
104555	104590	104505	104505	him	143	“ I wonder if I ’ll be as good at picking out rings as I am at picking out blue dresses ? Maybe you should help me . Nobody is more stylish than you . ”
104591	104598	104599	104599	she	141	“ The design is n’t important , ”
104603	104634	104599	104599	she	141	“ Aw , I know you love me , Lo . But if you ’re wearing it every day until you die , maybe you should approve of the design ? ”
104635	104643	104644	104644	She	141	“ When you put it that way . ”
104661	104678	104652	104652	he	2561	“ Hey — you wo n’t believe what my father gave me for a graduation gift . ”
104679	104682	104644	104644	She	141	“ What ? ”
104683	104690	104652	104652	he	2561	“ A hundred thousand dollar check . ”
104697	104705	104691	104691	Mike	143	“ Your father is such an asshole . ”
104706	104710	104644	104644	She	141	“ Thank you ! ”
104737	104758	104730	104735	the worst sort of control freak	2565	“ If he ’d given me the money when I was eighteen , I would have graduated a decade sooner . ”
104790	104796	104797	104797	He	143	“ You know . . . ”
104802	104833	104799	104799	his	143	“ That vile man did me a favor , though . If it was n’t for your long tenure in the front office , I might not have found you . ”
104841	104847	104848	104848	she	141	“ Yes , you would , ”
104852	104880	104848	104848	she	141	“ I would have been the manager ’s daughter who hung around at home games , instead of the manager ’s daughter who ran the front office . ”
104881	104886	104887	104887	he	143	“ You ’re right , ”
104891	104898	104887	104887	he	143	“ That would have been enough . ”
104960	104963	104964	104964	Lauren	141	“ Shit , ”
104975	104978	104964	104964	Lauren	141	“ Whassamatter ? ”
105000	105031	105032	105032	He	143	“ More top secret dealings at the office tower . There goes my idea to ask Nate for a day off so I could fly out to see game five . ”
105041	105062	105034	105034	his	143	“ Bummer , honey . I ’ll miss you , but you got ta do what you got ta do . ”
105085	105097	105072	105072	She	141	“ It ’s been fun to be your fan girl again . ”
105098	105128	105129	105129	He	143	“ I ’d love to see your pretty face in Dallas . But I have a weird job , babe . It ’s not always going to be convenient . ”
105141	105154	105129	105129	He	143	“ I ’ll take what you can give me and be happy . ”
105177	105192	105168	105168	He	143	“ When are you going to tell Nate you ’ll need a maternity leave ? ”
105193	105204	105172	105172	his	143	“ I do n’t know . Soon , I guess ? ”
105205	105213	105172	105172	his	143	“ Are you worried about his reaction ? ”
105214	105250	105168	105168	He	143	“ Not at all . I just want to be sure the pregnancy takes before I talk about it . Telling Nate will be fine . He ’ll stop trying to transfer me to California . ”
105251	105256	105172	105172	his	143	“ What ’s that ? ”
105265	105283	105257	105257	Mike	143	“ Nate offered me a pretty cool job in Silicon Valley . I keep putting him off . ”
105284	105292	105168	105168	He	143	“ Are you thinking about taking it ? ”
105293	105299	105168	105168	He	143	“ No ! Not happening . ”
105300	105308	105309	105309	She	2570	“ Is that a problem , though ? ”
105314	105380	105309	105309	She	2570	“ I was never going to California . I want to be here . There ’s you , there ’s the pretty damned good job I already have . And my family , not that they ’re at the top of my list . But even when I was planning to have a baby without you , I knew I ’d need my family nearby . ”
105388	105398	105381	105381	He	2571	“ You never told me about the California job . ”
105399	105417	105418	105418	Mike	143	“ That ’s because it ’s not interesting to me unless I ’m both single and childless . ”
105430	105443	105418	105418	Mike	143	“ I do n’t want you to be either of those things . ”
105444	105450	105381	105381	He	2571	“ Me neither , then . ”
105475	105479	105418	105418	Mike	143	“ bullshit - proofing ”
105489	105499	105500	105500	she	141	“ Did n’t the bankers do their due diligence ? ”
105504	105554	105500	105500	she	141	“ Yeah , up to a point . But they want the fee , right ? I want you to go over their claims of market dominance and see if anything looks too good to be true . I ’m going to take a look at their technical specs . ”
105555	105561	105572	105572	she	141	“ All right . Sure . ”
105697	105722	105680	105680	He	133	“ Let ’s go over the financials before I go . I called a car to take me to the airport at two thirty . ”
105723	105726	105727	105727	Lauren	141	“ Okay . ”
105782	105811	105812	105813	her boss	303	“ If we ca n’t get through it all now , we could talk on the phone before the game starts . Or we could Skype tomorrow morning , ”
105816	105821	105822	105822	She	141	“ Or . . . ”
105832	105847	105822	105822	She	141	“ . . . on the jet . I could ride along to Dallas . ”
105853	105857	105858	105858	she	141	“ Never mind , ”
105862	105867	105858	105858	she	141	“ We can Skype . ”
105888	105891	105892	105892	he	133	“ No , ”
105900	105930	105892	105892	he	133	“ I love this idea . I ’m just surprised . Did n’t think you were still watching hockey . I have n’t seen you in the box lately . ”
105931	105948	105949	105949	she	141	“ What ? You mean you do n’t know every gossipy detail about my personal life ? ”
105952	105975	105949	105949	she	141	“ I flew to Detroit for game seven with Mike ’s daughter . And I ’ve been watching from his comp seats . ”
105985	105988	105979	105979	Nate	133	“ Reallly . ”
105989	105995	105892	105892	he	133	“ Go ahead and gloat . ”
105996	106027	105979	105979	Nate	133	“ Oh , I will . You do n’t have a change of clothes for Dallas , though . I know how that goes against every fiber of your being . ”
106028	106034	106035	106035	He	133	“ It will be fine . ”
106047	106066	106035	106035	He	133	“ Let ’s go now . We ’ll swing by your place and then hop onto the FDR . ”
106067	106077	105979	105979	Nate	133	“ You really do n’t have to . . . ”
106078	106121	105979	105979	Nate	133	“ I know . But this gives me even more time to gloat . Let ’s go , hockey lover . Do n’t forget to bring some face paint . I could help you put Beacon ’s jersey number on each cheek . ”
106122	106128	106035	106035	He	133	“ That is not happening . ”
106129	106139	105979	105979	Nate	133	“ You want a lift to Dallas or not ? ”
106140	106151	105979	105979	Nate	133	“ Fine , but you ’re getting painted , too . ”
106152	106156	106035	106035	He	133	“ Am not . ”
106157	106161	106162	106162	They	2586	“ Are so . ”
106190	106207	106186	106186	Becca	211	“ Hey ! If we ’re both here , who ’s minding the team in Dallas ? ”
106217	106242	106208	106208	Becca	211	“ The intern Nate stapled to my hip is surprisingly competent . We sent her ahead because I had a therapy session this morning . ”
106243	106251	106252	106252	Becca	211	“ How ’s that going , anyway ? ”
106257	106297	106254	106254	her	211	“ Really well , honestly . I feel so much better . I do n’t tire as easily , and my headaches have stopped . These new doctors are amazing , but do n’t tell Nate I said so . ”
106298	106303	106208	106208	Becca	211	“ He ’ll gloat . ”
106304	106307	106254	106254	her	211	“ Exactly . ”
106308	106314	106315	106317	Their fearless leader	394	“ Ladies ? Shall we ? ”
106340	106347	106348	106348	Lauren	141	“ Where shall I set up ? ”
106351	106361	106348	106348	Lauren	141	“ You want to finish our debrief , right ? ”
106365	106374	106362	106362	Nate	133	“ Sure . Let ’s take the table . ”
106490	106502	106503	106505	the flight attendant	2593	“ To start I can offer you Caesar salad or gazpacho , ”
106508	106527	106503	106505	the flight attendant	2593	“ Then , would you prefer the crab cakes , the chicken parmesan , or the Thai beef ? ”
106541	106553	106534	106534	Lauren	141	“ I ’m really not hungry this evening . Thank you . ”
106554	106571	106572	106572	Becca	211	“ We wo n’t get to the rink until it ’s ten P.M. New York time , ”
106584	106595	106596	106596	Lauren	141	“ Um , I ’d love a roll with butter , ”
106619	106628	106596	106596	Lauren	141	“ And maybe I ’ll try the gazpacho . ”
106629	106632	106633	106633	Becca	211	“ Certainly . ”
107263	107268	107269	107269	Nate	133	“ Are you okay ? ”
107289	107292	107293	107293	She	141	“ Yep . ”
107310	107318	107319	107319	She	141	“ Is there a bug going around ? ”
107374	107379	107380	107380	Lauren	141	“ I ’m fine , ”
107384	107394	107380	107380	Lauren	141	“ You ’re not going to catch a bug . ”
107437	107443	107444	107444	Lauren	141	“ No , thank you , ”
107454	107468	107444	107444	Lauren	141	“ But if you would n’t mind , I ’d love another roll . ”
107469	107474	107475	107475	Becca	211	“ And , miss ? ”
107485	107495	107475	107475	Becca	211	“ Do you have any saltines in their packages ? ”
107496	107505	107506	107506	Lauren	141	“ Of course . I ’ll bring some . ”
107557	107565	107566	107566	she	211	“ Can I bring anyone a drink ? ”
107569	107585	107566	107566	she	211	“ Mr. Kattenberger , we have several single - malt Scotches on board this evening . ”
107591	107599	107588	107588	his	2611	“ Just a Diet Coke , please . ”
107600	107608	107609	107609	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll have one , too , ”
107628	107632	107621	107621	Nate	133	“ Excuse me ? ”
107633	107636	107588	107588	his	2611	“ What ? ”
107637	107654	107609	107609	Lauren	141	“ You never drink Diet Coke . You called it vile , and made of chemicals . ”
107655	107663	107664	107664	she	141	“ I ordered it to amuse you , ”
107748	107756	107757	107757	she	141	“ Should we finish up our work ? ”
107767	107792	107762	107762	He	303	“ You should probably go sit in a reclining chair and try to sleep . How else are you going to kick that bug ? ”
107798	107826	107762	107762	He	303	“ You seriously ca n’t stand the thought of passing a file folder back and forth , right ? You think I ’m toxic . Be honest . ”
107827	107846	107847	107847	Becca	211	“ No . It ’s . . . we just do n’t need to finish it right now . ”
107856	107866	107847	107847	Becca	211	“ Nate , I ’m not sick , okay ? ”
107881	107891	107892	107892	He	303	“ This is a bug you can never catch . ”
107899	107902	107892	107892	He	303	“ Omigod , ”
107906	107920	107921	107921	She	211	“ It ’s good to know he ’s thick about a few things . ”
107931	107945	107921	107921	She	211	“ These are for you . Keep them in your bag for emergencies . ”
107946	107949	107950	107950	Lauren	141	“ Really ? ”
107972	107976	107950	107950	Lauren	141	“ Thank you . ”
107977	107981	107982	107982	Becca	211	“ No problem , ”
107988	108001	107982	107982	Becca	211	“ My sister went through bushels of crackers when she . . . ”
108047	108052	108054	108054	he	133	“ Oh , Jesus . ”
108057	108066	108067	108067	Becca	211	“ That ’s Nate - speak for congratulations , ”
108070	108076	108067	108067	Becca	211	“ I ’m pretty sure . ”
108077	108080	108081	108081	Nate	133	“ Sorry , ”
108084	108087	108081	108081	Nate	133	“ Congratulations . ”
108088	108092	108067	108067	Becca	211	“ Thank you . ”
108102	108135	108093	108093	Lauren	141	“ It ’s really early , and I did n’t plan to mention it yet . But if I ’m going to puke frequently I guess you ’re going to wonder why . ”
108136	108143	108144	108144	Becca	211	“ I hope you do n’t , ”
108147	108158	108144	108144	Becca	211	“ That sounds miserable . I ’m never getting pregnant . ”
108165	108168	108159	108159	Nate	133	“ Never ? ”
108169	108172	108173	108173	she	211	“ Nope ! ”
108177	108180	108173	108173	she	211	“ Seriously ? ”
108221	108224	108225	108225	Becca	211	“ Well , ”
108228	108255	108256	108256	She	211	“ Not soon , anyway . I ’m waiting until science solves the problem of morning sickness , and then I ’ll give it a whirl . ”
108300	108308	108309	108309	Nate	133	“ Should we finish the briefing then ? ”
108322	108325	108326	108326	Lauren	141	“ Sure , ”
108349	108370	108371	108371	She	141	“ I guess the California job is probably not going to be the right fit for you , is it ? ”
108374	108384	108371	108371	She	141	“ It ’s not the best idea , no . ”
108396	108435	108392	108392	Nate	133	“ Forget it . I ’ll find you something in New York . We ’ll talk about it when the play - offs are over . Can you still go to China at the end of the month ? ”
108436	108451	108385	108385	His	133	“ Of course . And I ’ll try not to puke at every meal . ”
108452	108487	108392	108392	Nate	133	“ Hmm . So I guess the exotic cuisine tour I ’d been scoping out is off the table ? Maybe now is n’t the best time to try dog , or pickled eel ? ”
108488	108491	108385	108385	His	133	“ Nate ! ”
108496	108499	108385	108385	His	133	“ Sorry . ”
108559	108598	108599	108600	the girl	1941	“ Y’all did n’t tell me Lauren was coming , but luckily I read the flight manifest to double - check the times and I found her name ! I was able to print a pass in time , ”
108603	108607	108608	108608	Lauren	141	“ Thank you , ”
108611	108620	108608	108608	Lauren	141	“ I ’m crashing everyone ’s party today . ”
108633	108639	108640	108640	Nate	133	“ Shall we go up ? ”
108650	108653	108654	108654	Lauren	141	“ Sure , ”
108677	108680	108681	108681	Lauren	141	“ Hey ! ”
108684	108690	108681	108681	Lauren	141	“ I can carry that . ”
108691	108694	108695	108695	He	133	“ Nope . ”
108703	108708	108695	108695	He	133	“ Not this time . ”
108709	108715	108681	108681	Lauren	141	“ I ’m not fragile . ”
108716	108723	108724	108724	They	2625	“ Did n’t say you were . ”
108731	108747	108724	108724	They	2625	“ I ’m happy for you , Lauren . Congratulations on your graduation , too . ”
108748	108752	108681	108681	Lauren	141	“ Thank you ! ”
108753	108763	108771	108771	he	133	“ Exciting stuff , lady . All of it . ”
108820	108830	108831	108831	Lauren	141	“ You just got your picture taken kissing me , ”
108835	108847	108831	108831	Lauren	141	“ That will probably show up in a gossip column tomorrow . ”
108848	108861	108918	108919	a boss	2626	“ Great . Now Mike Beacon is going to break my jaw . ”
108862	108871	108872	108872	Lauren	141	“ Bones heal , and chicks dig scars , ”
108879	108884	108872	108872	Lauren	141	“ Good to know . ”
109462	109468	109469	109469	He	133	“ Hey ! You came ! ”
109476	109484	109469	109469	He	133	“ I thought you had to work . ”
109485	109491	109526	109526	he	133	“ I hitchhiked with Nate . ”
109492	109495	109496	109496	He	133	“ Yay ! ”
109520	109525	109526	109526	he	133	“ Let ’s go , ”
109541	109550	109526	109526	he	133	“ Are you going to ride the bus ? ”
109556	109570	109551	109551	He	133	“ Let ’s walk . You can catch me up on your day . ”
109603	109617	109618	109618	She	141	“ So you rode on Nate ’s Gulfstream ? What is that like ? ”
109621	109639	109640	109640	She	141	“ Well , I spent some quality time puking in the jet ’s very fancy little bathroom . ”
109649	109658	109659	109659	he	133	“ And I thought my day was hard , ”
109666	109683	109659	109659	he	133	“ Maybe it wo n’t last very long . I ’ll ask the doctor next week . ”
109717	109737	109663	109663	her	141	“ Tell me about this doctor visit . Will they be able to tell us the baby ’s sex ? ”
109738	109748	109663	109663	her	141	“ Oh , I ’m not going to ask . ”
109749	109752	109753	109753	he	133	“ What ? ”
109767	109770	109758	109758	she	141	“ Seriously ? ”
109771	109799	109800	109800	He	133	“ Sure . In the olden days , nobody knew . They survived . I do n’t want to know until the baby is here and healthy . ”
109803	109839	109800	109800	He	133	“ People survived in the olden days , huh ? Unless they got the plague or tuberculosis . Embrace the progress , baby . I want to know if I have to repaint the nursery . ”
109840	109843	109844	109844	Lauren	141	“ Hmm , ”
109853	109872	109844	109844	Lauren	141	“ That ’s a good point . I suppose we ’d want to repaint before the baby comes . ”
109873	109888	109889	109889	He	133	“ Right ? Paint fumes would be bad for the baby . Very bad . ”
109928	109931	109932	109932	she	141	“ Okay , ”
109940	109955	109932	109932	she	141	“ Let ’s paint the nursery white . That way it wo n’t matter . ”
109964	109969	109959	109959	his	143	“ You kill me . ”
109970	109973	109974	109974	Lauren	141	“ Shh ! ”
109988	109991	109992	109992	she	141	“ Look ! ”
109995	109999	110000	110000	he	133	“ At what ? ”
110075	110082	110066	110066	Lauren	141	“ That ’s Nate and Rebecca ! ”
110083	110088	110089	110089	he	133	“ Uh - huh , ”
110092	110103	110104	110104	Her	141	“ But honey — I knew they were a thing . ”
110110	110121	110104	110104	Her	141	“ What ? How ? You did n’t tell me ! ”
110122	110132	110133	110133	he	133	“ You ’re the one who knows Nate best , ”
110140	110165	110133	110133	he	133	“ I just assumed you knew . But remember that night I , uh , let myself into your hotel room in Bal Harbour ? ”
110172	110178	110166	110166	She	141	“ How could I forget ? ”
110179	110204	110246	110246	Lauren	141	“ The next morning when I snuck out of your room and let myself into mine , he was sneaking out of Rebecca ’s . ”
110205	110209	110210	110210	Lauren	141	“ No way ! ”
110213	110216	110210	110210	Lauren	141	“ Finally ! ”
110217	110220	110221	110221	he	133	“ Finally , ”
110236	110245	110246	110246	Lauren	141	“ Is it safe to keep walking now ? ”
110265	110270	110251	110251	Rebecca	211	“ Looks like it . ”
110271	110294	110295	110295	She	141	“ Good . Because I ’m going to take you up to my room now , and nobody is sneaking out afterward . ”
110303	110307	110295	110295	She	141	“ Sounds perfect . ”
110397	110412	110380	110380	Beacon	143	“ Trevi — it ’s going to work this time . Are you ready ? ”
110413	110418	110419	110419	he	133	“ Sure , man , ”
110429	110432	110419	110419	he	133	“ Go . ”
110493	110500	110501	110501	Trevi	175	“ It ’s a tough angle , ”
110509	110519	110501	110501	Trevi	175	“ But he ’s a skilled competitor . . . ”
110520	110527	110531	110531	himself	133	“ And . . . now , ”
110537	110542	110543	110543	Trevi	175	“ Go , baby ! ”
110546	110549	110550	110551	the kid	2891	“ YEAHHH ! ”
110560	110575	110550	110551	the kid	2891	“ Will it be the pink pig ? Or that blue thing . . . ”
110594	110604	110605	110605	Trevi	175	“ Looking good as he heads into the dismount , ”
110608	110618	110605	110605	Trevi	175	“ This could be a world record . . . ”
110645	110652	110653	110653	Trevi	175	“ It ’s a podium finish , ”
110663	110682	110653	110653	Trevi	175	“ And . . . the phone is ringing . Whoa . Your very pregnant wife is calling . ”
110707	110718	110703	110703	He	143	“ Hey ! Everything okay ? How are you feeling ? ”
110719	110728	110683	110684	The kid	2891	“ I ’m feeling like my water broke . ”
110729	110738	110703	110703	He	143	“ No ! Really ? Are you sure ? ”
110748	110770	110771	110771	She	141	“ Oh , I ’m sure . Luckily I did n’t flood my office . It happened when I . . . ”
110774	110777	110771	110771	She	141	“ What ? ”
110778	110795	110683	110684	The kid	2891	“ I ’d just sat down on the toilet . Then whoosh ! Weirdest thing ever . ”
110796	110799	110800	110800	He	143	“ Wow . ”
110815	110826	110800	110800	He	143	“ Okay , you need to get to the hospital . ”
110827	110843	110844	110844	He	143	“ I know . I called you first . Now I ’m calling a car . ”
110852	110869	110872	110872	her	141	“ Actually , Nate is calling me a car . He ’s panicking . Hang on . ”
110878	110896	110872	110872	her	141	“ No ! Do not call 911 . That ’s ridiculous . This is n’t an emergency ! ”
110897	110904	110905	110905	He	143	“ Want me to handle it ? ”
110945	110966	110996	110996	she	141	“ I ’ve got it . Seriously . Just figure out when you can get on a plane for home . ”
110967	110983	110996	110996	she	141	“ I ’ll do my best , baby ! Hang in there . Love you . ”
110984	110990	110996	110996	she	141	“ Love you , too . ”
111034	111037	111038	111038	She	141	“ Becca ! ”
111042	111047	111038	111038	She	141	“ What is it ? ”
111048	111060	111061	111061	Becca	211	“ Lauren went into labor . I need to get home . ”
111077	111093	111061	111061	Becca	211	“ I ’m on it . Give me five minutes to find you a flight . ”
111094	111101	111102	111102	Silas	169	“ What ’s this I hear ? ”
111115	111125	111102	111102	Silas	169	“ Is this the call I think it is ? ”
111126	111138	111102	111102	Silas	169	“ You ’re playing tomorrow night in Toronto . You ready ? ”
111139	111156	111157	111157	Silas	169	“ Of course . Do n’t worry about a thing . I ’ll go tell Coach . ”
111346	111349	111350	111350	he	169	“ Hey ! ”
111365	111371	111350	111350	he	169	“ What did I miss ? ”
111372	111381	111382	111382	she	2686	“ I ’m so happy to see you , ”
111390	111412	111413	111413	She	2686	“ You did n’t miss much . They keep checking me , but I have n’t made it to ten centimeters . ”
111428	111438	111413	111413	She	2686	“ That ’s Pitocin , to move things along . ”
111439	111443	111444	111444	He	169	“ All right . ”
111449	111455	111444	111444	He	169	“ How ’s your pain ? ”
111456	111461	111462	111462	she	2686	“ Well . . . ”
111465	111481	111482	111482	she	2686	“ I do n’t know why I did n’t expect it to hurt so much , ”
111497	111504	111485	111485	He	169	“ Do you want the anesthesiologist ? ”
111505	111515	111516	111516	she	2686	“ I think I do . Oh . . . ”
111519	111525	111516	111516	she	2686	“ Here we go again . ”
111546	111551	111552	111552	he	169	“ I got you , ”
111598	111610	111589	111589	she	2686	“ I think that was four minutes since the last one . ”
111616	111622	111623	111623	she	2693	“ Oh , hello there ! ”
111635	111650	111627	111627	He	169	“ She says she ’s ready to talk to the anesthesiologist about an epidural . ”
111651	111658	111659	111660	the nurse	1920	“ I ’ll just page him , ”
111663	111681	111682	111682	Lauren	141	“ I thought if I did n’t get it yet , the baby might wait for you , ”
111690	111693	111682	111682	Lauren	141	“ Why ? ”
111707	111716	111717	111717	He	169	“ Hey , I like your game jersey . ”
111736	111755	111729	111729	She	141	“ Thank you for being funny right now . I ’m freaking out . I hate freaking out . ”
111756	111770	111771	111771	He	169	“ You are going to be fine . And so is the baby . ”
111783	111804	111771	111771	He	169	“ But if you want the drugs , just go for it . There ’s no championship cup for suffering . ”
111805	111809	111810	111810	she	141	“ I know , ”
111816	111844	111810	111810	she	141	“ Mike , can I just say that I ’m really happy you ’ve done this before ? At least one of us knows what ’s happening . ”
111845	111848	111849	111849	He	169	“ Aw . ”
111870	111879	111880	111880	He	169	“ That ’s not why I ’m unafraid . ”
111890	111916	111880	111880	He	169	“ We do n’t need to know anything , because there are a dozen doctors and nurses on this floor who do this every day . ”
111917	111920	111921	111921	She	141	“ Mmm . ”
111962	111967	111968	111968	She	141	“ Breathe , baby . ”
111975	111981	111968	111968	She	141	“ Fuck , that hurts . ”
111982	111986	111988	111988	he	169	“ I know . ”
112122	112129	112137	112137	his	2701	“ How are we doing today ? ”
112143	112152	112153	112153	Mike	143	“ Well , I ’m feeling pretty good , ”
112156	112159	112153	112153	Mike	143	“ You ? ”
112160	112163	112164	112164	Lauren	141	“ Ouch , ”
112172	112195	112167	112169	The younger man	2703	“ That sounds about right . I ’m Dr. Phelps , the anesthesiologist . Do you want to talk about an epidural ? ”
112196	112203	112204	112204	Lauren	141	“ Let ’s skip the talking , ”
112207	112213	112204	112204	Lauren	141	“ I ’ll take it . ”
112219	112235	112214	112215	Dr. Phelps	282	“ All right . I ’ll be back in a few minutes with my cart . ”
112538	112542	112543	112543	Lauren	141	“ It burns , ”
112546	112552	112553	112554	the doctor	1319	“ The baby is crowning , ”
112557	112566	112553	112554	the doctor	1319	“ Do you want to feel the head ? ”
112567	112570	112571	112571	Lauren	141	“ No , ”
112574	112582	112571	112571	Lauren	141	“ Let ’s just finish this up . ”
112587	112602	112583	112584	The doctor	1319	“ Two more good pushes and you ’ll hear your baby cry . Ready ? ”
112613	112618	112619	112619	he	143	“ Almost , honey , ”
112667	112672	112673	112674	the doctor	1319	“ That ’s it ! ”
112677	112704	112673	112674	the doctor	1319	“ I have your baby ’s head in my hand . One more push and you ’ll know if it ’s a boy or a girl . ”
112745	112757	112741	112742	the doctor	1319	“ Baby boy , time of birth two thirty - seven A.M. ”
112765	112774	112758	112759	The nurse	1920	“ Come and cut the cord , Dad . ”
112902	112906	112907	112908	her husband	1976	“ Eight pounds ! ”
112911	112918	112907	112908	her husband	1976	“ No wonder you were early . ”
112919	112924	112925	112926	the pediatrician	2737	“ Good Apgar score , ”
112943	112949	112950	112950	Mike	143	“ I ’ve got you , ”
112964	112983	112950	112950	Mike	143	“ I know Mommy just spent a whole day squeezing your head . But that part ’s over . ”
113023	113045	113016	113017	The nurse	1920	“ Would you like to try to nurse him ? He ’s sucking on your husband ’s fingertip like a champ . ”
113046	113049	113050	113050	Lauren	141	“ Sure , ”
113060	113069	113070	113070	Mike	143	“ I have to hand him over already ? ”
113092	113099	113074	113074	he	143	“ He looks just like me . ”
113155	113160	113161	113161	she	141	“ I ’m sorry , ”
113164	113174	113161	113161	she	141	“ I ’m just so happy he ’s here . ”
113175	113182	113183	113184	the nurse	1920	“ That took a long time , ”
113187	113195	113196	113196	Mike	143	“ Oh , you have no idea , ”
113239	113247	113248	113248	Mike	143	“ Look at ’ i m go , ”
113280	113287	113267	113267	He	143	“ Can I take your picture ? ”
113288	113292	113293	113293	she	141	“ God no , ”
113297	113303	113293	113293	she	141	“ I ’m a mess . ”
113304	113330	113331	113331	His	143	“ Please ? I wo n’t show anybody , Lo . It ’s just for us . We ’re not afraid of messes , right ? ”
113337	113342	113343	113343	He	143	“ Okay , yes . ”
113351	113374	113375	113375	He	143	“ If only we ’d won the Cup , we could have had one of those shots with the baby inside it . ”
113383	113395	113375	113375	He	143	“ You ’ll just have to have another one next year . ”
113403	113412	113400	113400	Lauren	141	“ Both of you say ‘ cheese ’ ! ”
113556	113568	113569	113569	he	175	“ They have to honor the financial parts of your contract , ”
113572	113607	113569	113569	he	175	“ so you ’ll make the big bucks for two years , no matter what . But they do n’t have to keep you in Brooklyn . They can stash you in the minors . ”
113608	113617	113618	113618	he	175	“ That ’s the worst that can happen ? ”
113621	113625	113626	113627	the agent	2755	“ Pretty much , ”
113630	113666	113626	113627	the agent	2755	“ I mean , if the new coach really hates your guts , he could prevent you from being traded to another team that wants you . But that would be both expensive and extreme . ”
113669	113674	113675	113675	he	175	“ Good to know , ”
113698	113701	113702	113702	she	211	“ Here , ”
113705	113715	113702	113702	she	211	“ Everyone on the team gets a party favor . ”
113741	113756	113757	113757	She	211	“ I ’m going to port your number onto the Katt Phone . . . ”
113762	113796	113759	113759	her	211	“ Whoops . That ’s our nickname for them . The real name is the T-5000 . Anyway — you’ll carry this for as long as you ’re a member of the team . ”
113797	113800	113803	113803	he	175	“ Okay . ”
113811	113874	113803	113803	he	175	“ The big app on the front page will always know everything about your schedule — where to be , and when . When you ’re traveling , we push local weather and traffic information to you , as well as cab company numbers and restaurants . The floorplan of every hotel where you ’ll stay . Your room number . Everything . ”
113875	113879	113880	113880	Leo	175	“ Got it , ”
113924	113944	113945	113945	Becca	211	“ There ’s a narrow light strip all around the phone that changes color when it wants your attention , ”
113948	113988	113945	113945	Becca	211	“ You ’ll see . If the edges of the phone glow yellow , there ’s an update you need to see . If it glows red , there ’s an emergency , or an important change of plans . ”
113989	113992	114093	114093	She	211	“ Groovy . ”
113993	113999	114000	114000	Becca	211	“ And one more tip ? ”
114003	114057	114000	114000	Becca	211	“ When you ask the phone a question , if you say Nate ’s name first , you ’ll get a priority hyper - connection . So do n’t just say , ‘ What time is the jet leaving ? ’ Say , ‘ Nate , what time is the jet leaving ? ’ ”
114058	114062	114093	114093	She	211	“ Got it . ”
114063	114092	114093	114093	She	211	“ That feature will even swap you onto another cell phone network if you do n’t have enough bars . It ’s awesome . If a bit egotistical . ”
114103	114106	114107	114107	She	211	“ Well . ”
114113	114124	114125	114125	She	211	“ Let ’s get you to the players ’ lounge . ”
114336	114339	114340	114340	Becca	211	“ Gentlemen , ”
114359	114375	114340	114340	Becca	211	“ This is Leo Trevi , a forward , and Mr. Kattenberger ’s newest trade . ”
114382	114384	114340	114340	Becca	211	“ yo ”
114386	114389	114340	114340	Becca	211	“ welcome . ”
114390	114395	114396	114397	A player	606	“ Hey , man . ”
114459	114462	114463	114463	Leo	175	“ Hey , ”
114466	114472	114463	114463	Leo	175	“ Glad to be here . ”
114522	114531	114532	114532	Becca	211	“ He does n’t have a locker yet , ”
114535	114554	114532	114532	Becca	211	“ Will you do any rearranging ? Or shall we give him the , um , open spot ? ”
114606	114616	114617	114617	he	134	“ Put ’ i m in the open spot , ”
114680	114694	114695	114695	Becca	211	“ The publicist will arrive shortly to brief everyone on the press conference , ”
114698	114707	114695	114695	Becca	211	“ Until then , make yourself at home . ”
114708	114715	114764	114764	O’Doul	134	“ Thanks . I appreciate it . ”
114716	114722	114723	114723	O’Doul	134	“ So where you from ? ”
114727	114763	114723	114723	O’Doul	134	“ Here . Grew up in Huntington on the North Shore . Been watching this team forever . When I was five is the first time my dad got season tickets to the . . . ”
114773	114791	114723	114723	O’Doul	134	“ Do n’t say it . Kattenberger does n’t allow anyone to speak the old franchise name . ”
114792	114795	114764	114764	O’Doul	134	“ Sorry ? ”
114796	114809	114810	114810	O’Doul	134	“ Inside this building , you can only call us the Bruisers . ”
114813	114902	114810	114810	O’Doul	134	“ See ? I can say it easily now . Took me a year to break the habit . I mean — Kattenberger is a bit of a whack job on this particular point . It ’s like a Voldemort thing . The Team That Shall Not Be Named . But since the boss man paid his left nut for the franchise and changed the name , he can do it his way . If you want to avoid his wrath , you never say that old name . ”
114903	114908	114909	114910	The captain	900	“ Um , thanks ? ”
114916	114962	114909	114910	The captain	900	“ I know it ’s weird . I still have all the old pennants in a box somewhere . If Kattenberger knew , he ’d probably send one of his ninja minions to my apartment to have ’em incinerated . Where else you play hockey ? ”
114963	114984	114985	114985	O’Doul	134	“ Drafted by Detroit . Sent down to Muskegon ’s AHL team for two seasons . Harkness College before that . ”
114990	115002	114985	114985	O’Doul	134	“ Aw , an Ivy League boy . That ’s cute . ”
115027	115038	115018	115018	Leo	175	“ Did the owner choose the new color , too ? ”
115045	115071	115072	115072	Leo	175	“ You betcha . Him and a bunch of million dollar marketing gurus . We call it indigo , ’cause that sounds better than purple . ”
115075	115081	115072	115072	Leo	175	“ Thanks for the tip . ”
115082	115146	115018	115018	Leo	175	“ Stick with me , kid . Might want to grab yourself a bottle of water . If you ’re the new guy , they might make you say a few words at the press conference . Publicist will let you know . Though maybe they wo n’t get around to it , because the whole coach thing is a pretty big story . ”
115149	115153	115018	115018	Leo	175	“ No kidding . ”
115154	115226	115258	115258	He	2784	“ The last guy got fired — what — a year and a half ago , now ? Kattenberger had to do it . The guy was a good coach , but you do n’t trash - talk the new owner like that . Then an interim coach got cancer . So now it ’s on to Worthington . He ’s another Long Island guy . Could be worse , right ? ”
115248	115257	115258	115258	He	2784	“ Where did you say that water was ? ”
115264	115279	115258	115258	He	2784	“ Espresso machine is over there , too , if that ’s your thing . ”
115280	115283	115284	115284	Leo	175	“ Thanks . ”
115307	115310	115311	115311	he	175	“ Thanks , ”
115318	115324	115311	115311	he	175	“ Great to be here . ”
115752	115762	115767	115767	him	175	“ Just open ’ er up and take one , ”
115769	115774	115767	115767	him	175	“ Anytime you need . ”
115775	115778	115779	115779	he	175	“ Thanks , ”
115817	115823	115824	115827	the guy beside him	2802	“ I ’m Silas Kelly , ”
115836	115840	115841	115841	Leo	175	“ Backup goalie . ”
115844	115857	115841	115841	Leo	175	“ Good to meet you . How long you been a Bruiser ? ”
115867	115889	115864	115864	Silas	169	“ This is my rookie year . Spent some time in Ontario on an ECHL team . Got traded in September . ”
115890	115893	115959	115959	He	175	“ Cool . ”
115894	115920	115864	115864	Silas	169	“ I ’ve played four games . Hoping the new coach is a fan so I can get off the bench a little more often . ”
115931	115936	115937	115937	Leo	175	“ I hear you , ”
115940	115958	115937	115937	Leo	175	“ Got ta say , if Coach Karl likes you , that ’ll make one of us . ”
115969	115977	115959	115959	He	175	“ Really ? You two have history ? ”
115978	115984	115959	115959	He	175	“ We have a little . ”
115996	116006	116007	116007	Leo	175	“ How ’d you get called up , then ? ”
116012	116016	116009	116009	his	175	“ No clue . ”
116025	116028	116067	116071	the woman in the doorway	2805	“ Gentlemen , ”
116299	116360	116361	116361	His	175	“ . . . We ’ll begin in fifteen minutes . Coach Worthington will thank Mr. Kattenberger for the opportunity to lead the team , and he ’ll say a few words about how excited he is to work with all of you . All most of you have to do is sit up straight and clap . Any questions ? ”
116404	116411	116394	116394	his	134	“ What is it , captain ? ”
116423	116440	116420	116420	her	137	“ Is it a coincidence that our new coach has the same last name as you ? ”
116441	116446	116447	116447	she	137	“ Yes and no , ”
116455	116482	116447	116447	she	137	“ It is a coincidence that we both work for the same team . But we have the same name because Coach Worthington is my father . ”
116486	116501	116447	116447	she	137	“ Thanks for clearing that up , babe . Is he pretty , too ? ”
116506	116516	116517	116517	she	137	“ You can decide for yourself , Mr. O’Doul , ”
116521	116565	116566	116566	She	137	“ And you ’ll have a good view , because I need you sitting on the dais up front . After Coach Worthington gives his remarks , you ’ll say a few words of welcome . I ’ve drafted something for you here . ”
116686	116699	116700	116700	O’Doul	287	“ Do I have to say this exactly as it ’s written ? ”
116707	116719	116700	116700	O’Doul	287	“ No , as long as you sound warm and articulate . ”
116720	116728	116729	116729	He	134	“ Just like I am every day . ”
116732	116738	116729	116729	He	134	“ Fine . What else ? ”
116739	116744	116745	116745	She	137	“ One more thing . ”
116754	116769	116747	116747	her	137	“ I need you to welcome a new player after you welcome your coach . ”
116795	116823	116785	116785	she	137	“ Mr. Leonardo Trevi , rookie forward , formerly of the Muskegon Muskrats . Traded from Detroit to Brooklyn for a second round draft pick this spring . ”
116824	116828	116829	116829	O’Doul	287	“ Got it , ”
116879	116889	116890	116890	she	137	“ Why are n’t you wearing a purple tie ? ”
116920	116935	116936	116936	He	175	“ Sorry . Did n’t own one . Muskrats do n’t wear purple ties . ”
116974	116980	116981	116981	she	137	“ Someone trade with him , ”
117070	117074	117075	117075	Georgia	137	“ Two minutes , ”
117082	117128	117078	117078	her	137	“ I want you to file into the press conference in exactly two minutes . Your seats are reserved in the two front rows . Do not take any questions on your way in . We ’ll start the conference the moment you ’re seated . ”
117144	117154	117155	117155	Silas	169	“ Dibs on giving the rookie my purple tie ! ”
117158	117163	117155	117155	Silas	169	“ I called it . ”
