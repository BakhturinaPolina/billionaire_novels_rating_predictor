I did n't know about it at the time , or I would have killed the son of a bitch . She finally left him and brought her kids to my mama 's house , and stayed there till she got her life back together . Saw a shrink and everything . My sister told me the thing that helped her the most was to hear it was n't her fault . She needed to hear that a lot . So I want to be the first one to tell you . . . it was n't your fault . "

If you fall trying to get up those steps by yourself , you 'd have to go to the hospital for sure . And I 'd have to go there with you , 'cause your brother would break both my legs . "

29896	29924	29889	29889	She	102	" No , it just sort of fell off the sides and stayed on the top . I 've been told it 'll grow back in eventually . "

30703	30708	30709	30709	I	0	" I know that , "
30712	30727	30709	30709	I	0	" I just want to think about things before I talk to a lawyer . "

31262	31315	31247	31247	Liberty	102	" He was so upset after he brought you home . He loves you . It drives him crazy , thinking of someone hurting you . It 's all he can do to stop himself from going to Dallas and . . . doing something that 's not in your best interests . "

31327	31372	31247	31247	Liberty	102	" No , no , he wo n't . Gage is very self - controlled when it comes to getting the results he wants . Believe me , he 'll do whatever is necessary to help you , no matter how hard it is . "

31541	31544	31538	31538	he	988	" Marie . "
31560	31575	31553	31553	she	102	" Oh , Haven . It 's like he was trying to erase you . "
31620	31635	31636	31636	she	102	" Your prescription instructions say that alcohol may magnify the effects of the medication , "
31639	31642	31643	31643	I	0	" Good , "
31651	31657	31643	31643	I	0	" Do n't be stingy . "
31686	31691	31692	31692	I	0	" What 's confusing , "
31703	31766	31692	31692	I	0	" are the times when he 's okay , because then you think everything is getting better . You know what buttons not to push . But then there are new buttons . And no matter how sorry you are , no matter how hard you try , everything you say and do builds up the tension until there 's an explosion . "
31767	31776	31777	31777	she	102	" And the explosions get worse each time , "
31788	31802	31777	31777	she	102	" Yeah , exactly . Did you ever date a guy like that ? "
31803	31808	31809	31809	Her	102	" My mother did . "
31815	31883	31809	31809	Her	102	" His name was Louis . A Jekyll and Hyde type . He started out charming and nice , and he led Mama step by step into the relationship , and by the time things got bad enough for her to leave , her self - esteem was shredded . At the time I was too young to understand why she let him treat her so badly . "
31902	31941	31884	31884	Her	102	" I think the thing you 've got to figure out is if Nick 's behavior is something that could be helped with counseling . If your leaving him would he enough to make him want to change . "
31977	31992	31993	31993	I	0	" I think with Nick , it 's always going to be about control , "
31997	32026	31993	31993	I	0	" I ca n't see him ever admitting something is his fault , or that he needs to change in any way . The fault is always mine . "
32041	32090	32036	32036	I	0	" I keep wondering . . . did he ever love me at all ? Was I anything more than just someone to push around and manipulate ? Because if he never cared about me , it makes me even more of an idiot for having loved him . "
32091	32104	32105	32105	Liberty	102	" Maybe he cared about you as much as he was capable , "
32113	32117	32108	32108	I	0	" Lucky me . "
32138	32146	32147	32147	I	0	" If I had known him longer , "

32242	32295	32234	32234	She	102	" Yes , although I would n't care to put Hardy in the same company as Nick . He would never hurt a woman . In fact , Hardy had the opposite problem . . . always wanting to rescue someone . . . I forget the name for it . . . "

I 've read that abusers choose women they can easily manipulate — they have a kind of radar for it . Like , if you filled the Astrodome with people and put one abusive man and one vulnerable woman in there , they 'd find each other . "

33822	33827	33810	33811	a parent	1032	" Susan replied wryly . "
33860	33924	33849	33849	they	696	"Susan and I did a lot of role - playing , which felt mortifyingly silly at first , but as she pretended by turns to be Nick , my father , a friend , a brother , even my long - gone mother , I practiced standing up for myself . It was hard , muscle - knotting , perspiration - inducing work . "No
33929	34409	33849	33849	they	696	" That phrase became my mantra . I figured if I told it to myself often enough , I would start believing it . Gage handled as much of the divorce proceedings as I would allow . And , possibly because of Liberty 's softening influence , he changed his approach to me . Instead of telling me how things were going to be , he patiently laid out choices and explained them , and did n't argue with my decisions . When Nick had dared to call the condo and demanded to talk to me , and I 'd said all right , Gage had forced himself to hand the phone to me . It had been quite a conversation , mostly one - sided , with Nick talking and me listening . My husband poured it on , progressing from guilt to fury to pleading , telling me it was my fault as much as his . You could n't just give up on a marriage when you hit a rough spot , he said . It was more than just a rough spot , I said . People who loved each other found a way to work things out , he said . You do n't love me , I said . He said he did . Maybe he had n't been the best husband , but I damn sure had n't been the best wife . I'm sure you 're right , I told him . But I do n't think I deserve get - ting a cracked rib . He said there was no way he 'd cracked my rib , that must have happened accidentally when I fell . I said he 'd pushed me , hit me . And I was astonished when Nick said he did n't remember hitting me . Maybe one of his hands had slipped . I wondered if he really did n't remember , if he could actually rewrite reality for himself , or if he was just lying . And then I realized it did n't matter . I'm not coming back , I said . And every comment he made after that , I repeated it . I 'm not coming back . I 'm not coming back . I hung up the phone and went to Gage , who had been sitting in the living area . His hands had clenched so hard in the arms of the leather chair that his fingertips had riveted deep gouges in the smooth hide . But he had let me fight my battle alone , as I had needed to . I had always loved Gage , but never so much as then . I filed for a divorce on the grounds of insupportability , meaning the marriage had become insupportable because of personality conflicts that had destroyed "
34418	34459	33849	33849	they	696	" That was the quickest way to end it , the lawyer said . If Nick did n't contest it . Otherwise there would be a trial , and all kinds of nastiness and humiliation in store for both parties . "Haven

35248	35349	35350	35350	you	1048	" I had smiled at that until I realized Gage had n't been joking . Gage and Liberty had let my family know that I was back in Houston , but that I would n't be ready to see anyone or do any telephone - talking for a while . Naturally Dad , who wanted to be in the center of whatever was going on , took offense at my elusiveness . He told Gage to tell me that any time I was ready to get off my high horse , he would like for me to come see him . "Did
35359	35364	35350	35350	you	1048	" I asked Gage . "Yes

35823	36545	35773	35773	I	0	"And with that , our relationship was back on track , as flawed and frustrating as it had ever been . But I had boundaries now , I reminded myself , and no one was going to cross them . I would be a fortress of one . I was a new person in the same world , which was a lot more difficult than being the same person in a new world . People thought they knew me but they did n't . With the exception of Todd , my old friends were no longer relevant to the new version of me . So I turned to my brothers for support , and I discovered that adulthood had done nice things for their personalities . Joe , a commercial photographer , made a point of telling me that he had a big house and there was plenty of room if I wanted to stay with him . He said he was gone a lot of the time , and we would n't infringe on each other 's privacy . I told him how much I appreciated the offer , but I needed my own place . Still , it would n't have been bad at all , living with him . Joe was an easygoing guy . I never heard him complain about anything . He took life as it came , which was a rare quality in the Travis family . But the real surprise was Jack , the brother I 'd never gotten along with — the one who 'd given me a bad haircut when I was three , and scared the wits out of me with bugs and garden snakes . The adult Jack turned out to be an unexpected ally . A friend . In his company I could fully relax , the haunted , anxious feeling burning away like water drops on a smoking griddle . Maybe it was because Jack was so straightforward . He claimed to be the least complex person the Travis family , and that was probably true . Jack was a hunter , comfortable with his status as a predatory omnivore . He was also an environmentalist and saw no conflict in that . Any hunter , he said , had better do his best to protect nature since he spent so much time out in it . With Jack , you always knew where you stood . If he liked something , he said so without hesitation , and if he did n't , he 'd tell you the truth about that too . He stayed on the right side of the law while admitting that some things were just more fun when they were illegal . He liked cheap women , fast cars , late nights , and hard liquor , especially all together . In Jack 's view , you were obliged to sin on Saturday night so you 'd have something to atone for Sunday morning . Otherwise you 'd be putting the preacher out of business . After Jack had graduated from UT , he 'd gone to work at a small property management company . Eventually he 'd gotten a loan , bought the company , and expanded it to four times its original size . It was the perfect occupation for Jack , who liked to fix things , to tinker and problem - solve . Like me , he had no interest in investment lingo and all the sophisticated financial strategies that Gage and Dad so relished . Jack preferred the nuts - and - bolts issues of working and living . He was good at backroom deals , cutting through legal bullshit , talking man - to - man . To Jack , there was nothing more powerful than a promise made over a handshake . He would have died — literally chosen death — before breaking his word . In light of my hotel experience at the Darlington , Jack said I 'd be perfect working for the residential side of his management company , which was headquarters at 1800 Main . His current on site manager was leaving on account of pregnancy — she warned to spend the first few years of her child 's life at home . "Thanks
36552	36567	36548	36548	I	0	" I said when Jack first broached the idea of my taking the job . "Why

36746	36869	36743	36743	Jack	97	" You 'd be in charge of the money stuff — insurance , payroll , maintenance bills . You 'd also negotiate service contracts , purchase supplies and equipment , and you 'd work with a leasing agent and an assistant . As the on - site manager , you 'd live in a one - bedroom unit in the building . But you would n't be stuck in the office all the time . . . you 'll have a lot of outside meetings . Later , when you 're ready , you could get involved in the commercial side of things , which would be a help since I 'm planning to branch out into construction management and then maybe — "
36870	36878	36879	36879	I	0	" Who 'd be paying my salary ? "
36883	36887	36879	36879	I	0	" You , or Dad?"Jack

36983	37062	36980	36980	I	0	" And I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate it . But I ca n't start out at the top , Jack . I do n't have enough experience . And it does n't look good for either of us , for you to give me a job like that when I have n't paid any dues . What if I start out as the manager 's assistant ? I could learn from the ground up .

37513	37559	37485	37485	she	102	" I said truthfully . I did n't care how I looked , as long as it was different . She blow - dried my hair using a round brush , ran her fingers through it to make it piecey , and beamed in satisfaction . "
37564	37611	37485	37485	she	102	"I stood and got a mild shock — a nice one — at my reflection . Liberty had given me long bangs that swept across my forehead , and a short layered bob , the feathered ends turning up gently . I looked stylish . Confident . "
37616	37624	37485	37485	she	102	" I said playing with the layers . "You
37633	37639	37485	37485	she	102	" she said , smiling . "

37703	38208	37668	37668	she	1067	" I said . The manager that Jack brought over from the other office was named Vanessa Flint . She was one of those highly groomed and put - together women who had probably looked thirty - five when she was twenty - five , and would still look thirty - five even when she was fifty - five . Although she was only medium height , her slimness and good posture fooled you into thinking she was a lot taller . Her face was fine - boned and serene beneath a sweep of ash - blond hair . I admired the composure she wore like a high - buttoned blouse . There was n't much substance to her voice , which was crisp and soft , like ice wrapped in velvet . But somehow it forced you to pay more attention , as if you shared in the responsibility of Vanessa making herself understood . I liked her at first . At least , I wanted to like her . Vanessa was friendly , sympathetic , and when we went out for drinks after our first day at work , I found myself confiding more about my failed marriage and divorce than I should have . But Vanessa had recently been divorced too , and there seemed to be enough similarities between our two exes that it was a pleasure to compare notes . Vanessa was frank about her concern over my relationship with Jack , and I appreciated her honesty . I reassured her that I had no intention of coasting by , or running to Jack just because he was my brother . Just the opposite , in fact . I was going to work a lot harder , because I had something to prove . She seemed satisfied by my earnest declarations , and said she thought we would work well together . Vanessa and I were both given apartments at 1800 Main . I felt a little guilty about it , knowing that no other manager 's assistant would have gotten an apartment , but it was the one concession I 'd made to Jack . He had insisted on it , and the truth was , I liked the security of living so close to my brother . The other employees lived off - site and came in each day , including a petite blond office manager named Kimmie ; the leasing agent , Samantha Jenkins ; the marketing agent , Phil Bunting ; and Rob Ryan in accounting . We contacted Jack 's commercial office whenever there was a need for legal resources , tech questions , or something we were n't equipped to handle on our own . It seemed that everyone who worked for Jack at the commercial office had acquired his personal style . . . everyone was relaxed and almost jovial , in comparison to our office . Vanessa ran a tighter ship , which meant no casual - dress Fridays , and a "
38212	38735	38911	38911	Susan	143	" policy that was never exactly spelled out . However , everyone seemed to regard her as a good boss , tough but fair - minded . I was ready to learn from her , follow her example . I thought she was going to be a great new influence in my life . But in a matter of days , I realized I was being gaslighted . I was familiar with the tactic , since Nick had done if a lot . A bully or someone with personality disorder needs to keep their victims confused , off balance , perpetually unsure of themselves . That way he or she could manipulate you more easily . Gaslighting could be anything that made you doubt yourself . For example , a bully would make a statement about something , and when you 'd agree with it , he 'd disagree with his own original statement . Or he 'd make you think you 'd lost something when you had n't , or accuse you of forgetting something when he 'd never asked you to do it in the first place . What worried me was that I seemed to be Vanessa 's only target . No one else seemed to be having a problem with her . She would misplace a file and tell me to get it for her , turning up the tension until I was scrambling to find it . If I could n't come up with it , she accused me of hiding the file somewhere . And then the file would turn up in some weird place , like beneath a plant on top of a cabinet , or wedged between the printer cart and her desk . She gave people the impression that I was scatterbrained and disorganized . And I had no proof of her mischief - making . The only thing that kept me from doubting myself was my own shaky sense of sanity . There was no predicting Vanessa 's moods or requests . I learned to save everything , after she asked me to write three different drafts of a letter and then decided on the first version after I 'd deleted it . She would tell me to be at a meeting at one - thirty , and when I arrived , I was a half hour late . And she swore she 'd told me one o'clock . She said I must not have paid attention . Vanessa let it drop to me that she 'd had an assistant named Helen for years , and she would have brought Helen with her to the new job , except that I 'd already been given the position . It had n't occurred to me that I would have broken up a long - running professional partnership , and robbed someone of a position they deserved . When Vanessa had me call Helen , who was still at the old office , to find out the name and number of Vanessa 's favorite manicurist , I took the opportunity to apologize to Helen . "God
38742	38746	38911	38911	Susan	143	" Helen said . "
38758	38859	38911	38911	Susan	143	"I wanted to quit right then . But I was stuck , and Vanessa and I both knew it . With my skimpy resume , I could n't quit a job right after starting one . And I did n't know how long it would take me to find something else . Complaining about Vanessa was out of the question — it would make me look like a prima donna , or paranoid , or both . So I decided I would stick it out for a year . I would make some contacts and dig my own way out . "Why
38862	38877	38878	38878	She	1068	" I asked my therapist , Susan , after describing the situation with Vanessa . "

38915	38939	38911	38911	Susan	143	" In fact , it 's most likely that Vanessa sees you as a threat . Someone she has to subdue and neutralize . ""Me

40806	41028	41030	41030	ma'am	2089	"In retrospect , I wished I 'd had sex with someone before Nick , some positive association that would help me get back in the saddle , so to speak . Bleakly I wondered how many men I was going to have to sleep with before I started to like it . I was n't good at acquired tastes . The mass of people inched by the bar . Every stool was occupied , hundreds of drinks set along the expanse of glittering mosaic table - top tiles . There was no way to get to the door other than follow along with the herd . Revulsion spiked in my stomach every time I felt another impersonal brush of someone 's hip , someone 's stomach , someone 's arm . To distract myself , I tried to calculate how many people beyond the acceptable fire code level had been admitted to the bar . Someone in the herd stumbled or staggered . It was a domino effect , one person falling into another until I felt the impact of a shoulder against mine . The momentum pushed me into the line of barstools , causing me to drop my purse . I would have bumped hard into the bar if someone sitting there had n't reached out to steady me . "Sorry
41032	41039	41030	41030	ma'am	2089	" someone called from the crowd . "It
41043	41053	41056	41056	me	0	" I said breathlessly , hunting for my purse . "Here

41076	41413	41414	41414	Travis	156	"As the guy straightened and handed me the purse , I looked up into a pair of blue eyes , and everything stopped , the sound of voices , the background music , every footstep , blink , breath , heartbeat . Only one person I 'd ever met had eyes that color . Dazzling . Devil - blue . I was slow to react , trying to jump - start my heart back into action , and then my pulse hammered too hard , too fast . All I could think of was that the last time — the only time — I 'd seen Hardy Cates , I 'd been wrapped around him in my family 's wine cellar . CHAPTER SIXPeople were pressing behind me , trying to get the bartender 's attention . I was about to be trampled . With a murmur , Hardy Cates guided me to the stool he 'd been occupying , helping me up . I was too dazed to object . The leather seat was warm from his body . He stood with one hand on the counter , the other on the back of my chair , sheltering me . Trapping me . Hardy was a little leaner than I remembered , a little more seasoned , tempered by maturity . The look of experience suited him , especially because somewhere deep in those eyes , there still lurked a dangerous invitation to play . He had a quality of masculine confidence that was a thousand times more potent than mere handsomeness . Perfect good looks could leave you cold , but this kind of sexy charisma went straight to your knees . I had no doubt every available woman at the bar had been drooling over him . In fact , just beyond the outline of his shoulder , I saw the leggy blonde in the next chair glaring at me . I had stumbled , literally , into the middle of their conversation . "Miss
41416	41432	41414	41414	Travis	156	" Hardy looked at me as if he could n't quite believe I was there . "

Not many men could do that . You had to work hard . And you had to be ruthless . I could believe that about him . Our gazes caught , held , the shared voltage nearly causing me to fall off the barstool .

I 'm going to fire my therapist , I thought . I should n't be nearly this screwed up after all the time I 've spent with her . "Bad

And I stood there in the drizzle like an idiot , breathing too hard , wrapping my arms around myself . My skin felt too tight for my body , like I 'd been shrink - wrapped . Someone came up behind me , and from the way the hairs on the back of my neck lifted , I knew Hardy had followed me . Without a word he draped his suit jacket around me , cocooning me in silk - lined wool . The feeling was so exquisite that I shivered . The scent of him was all around me , that sunny , soft spice I had never forgotten . . . God , it was good . Comforting and stimulating at the same time . Absolute world - class pheromones . I wished I could take his jacket home with me . Not him , just the jacket . I turned to look up at him , at the raindrops glittering in the rich brown locks of his hair . Water fell in tiny cool strikes on my face . He moved slowly , as if he thought a sudden move might startle me . I felt one of his palms curve along the side of my face , his thumb wiping at the raindrops on my cheek as if they were tears . "I'd

Standing in the rain , wrapped in his jacket , was about the best feeling I 'd had in a year . His head lowered over mine , but he did n't try to kiss me , just stood looking into my face , and I stared up into intense blue . His fingertips explored the underside of my jaw and wandered to the crest of my cheek . The pad of his thumb was slightly callused , sandpapery like a cat 's tongue . I was filled with mortified fire as I imagined what it might feel like if he — No . No , no . . . it would take years of therapy before I 'd be ready for that . "Give
43825	43829	43209	43209	We	1153	" he murmured . "That
43836	43842	43209	43209	We	1153	" I managed to say . "Why?"Because
43859	43867	43856	43856	I	0	" My family does n't like you . "Hardy
43879	43894	43871	43871	his	0	" Do n't tell me they 're still holding that one little business deal against me?""The
43906	43929	43930	43930	I	0	" — I paused to lick a raindrop from the corner of my mouth , and his gaze followed the movement alertly — "
43938	43943	43930	43930	I	0	"Hardy 's smile vanished . "
43964	44201	44202	44202	I	0	"It was raining harder now , turning his hair as dark and slick as otter 's fur , his lashes spiking over brilliant blue eyes . He looked good wet . He even smelled good wet , all clean skin and drenched cotton . His skin looked warm beneath the mist of droplets . In fact , as we stood there surrounded by the city , and falling water and lowering night , he seemed like the only warm thing in the world . He stroked a sodden curl back from my cheek , and another , his face still , severe . For all his size and strength , he touched me with a gentleness Nick had never been capable of . We were so close that I saw the texture of his close shaven skin , and I knew that the masculine smoothness would he delicious against my lips . I felt a sharp , sweet ache somewhere beneath my rib cage . Wistfully I thought of how much I wished I had gone with him that night at the wedding , to drink champagne under a strawberry moon . No matter how it might have ended , I wished I had done it . But it was too late now . A lifetime too late . A million wishes too late . The taxi pulled up . Hardy 's face remained over mine . "
44209	44339	44202	44202	I	0	" he said in a low voice . My insides turned into a mini - Chernobyl . I did n't understand myself , why I wanted so much to stay with him . Any rational person would know that Hardy Cates had no real interest in me . He wanted to annoy my family and get my sister - in - law 's attention . And if doing that meant screwing a girl from the other side of the tracks , so much the better . He was a predator . And for my own sake , I had to get rid of him . So I plastered a disdainful smile over the panic , and gave him a look that said I 've got your number , pal . "
44353	44389	44393	44393	Travis	125	" Even as I said it , I cringed inwardly at my own deliberate crudeness . Hardy responded with a long stare that fried every brain cell I possessed . And then he said softly , "
44395	44433	44435	44435	you	1159	"I went scarlet . I felt myself clenching in places I did n't even know I had muscles . And I was amazed that my legs still worked as I went to the taxi and got in . "Where
44438	44472	44435	44435	you	1159	" Hardy asked , and like an idiot , I told him . He handed a twenty to the cabbie , a huge overpayment since 1800 Main was only a few blocks away . "
44478	44502	44435	44435	you	1159	" he said , as if I were made of some fragile substance that might shatter at the first bump on the road . "Yes
44504	44660	44435	44435	you	1159	sir!"And it was n't until the cab pulled away that I realized I was still wearing his jacket . The normal thing would have been to have the jacket dry - cleaned immediately — there was a service in the building — and have someone take it to Hardy on Monday . But sometimes normal just is n't happening . Sometimes crazy feels too good to resist . So I kept the jacket , uncleaned , all weekend . I kept stealing over to it and taking deep breaths of it . That damned jacket , the smell of Hardy Cates on it , was crack . I finally gave in and wore it for a couple of hours while I watched a DVD movie . Then I called my best friend , Todd , who had recently forgiven me for not talking to him in months , and I explained the situation to him . "I'm
44668	44672	44435	44435	you	1159	" I said . "Was

44733	44748	44749	44749	I	0	" So I just put on the jacket and watched a movie in it , "
44752	44782	44749	44749	I	0	" In fact , I 'm wearing it right now . How far outside of normal is that ? On a scale of one to ten , how crazy am I?""Depends

44801	44842	44791	44791	I	0	"Haven , do n't ask me to define the boundaries of normal . You know how I was raised . My father once stuck strands of his own pubic hair onto a painting and sold it for a million dollars . "I
45102	45104	45105	45105	Todd	107	"So , "
45116	45123	45105	45105	Todd	107	" Can I come over and smell it?"I
45126	45161	45105	45105	Todd	107	" No , you 'd take it for yourself , and I have to give it back . But not until tomorrow , which means I have at least twelve hours left with it . ""I

45327	45392	45325	45325	Nick	92	sweetheart?"I had never told Todd that my husband had physically abused me . I was n't at the point that I could talk about it with anyone other than Gage , Liberty , or the therapist . The concern in Todd 's voice nearly undid me . I tried to answer , but it took forever to force a sound from my tight throat . "Yeah
45394	45411	45325	45325	Nick	92	" I finally whispered . My eyes flooded , and I wiped them with my palm . "
45417	45435	45325	45325	Nick	92	"Then it was Todd 's turn to wait a while , before he could manage to speak . "
45441	45446	45325	45325	Nick	92	" he asked simply . "You're

45913	45948	45908	45908	She	1209	" Would you please tell Vanessa for me ? I feel terrible . She made it clear we were supposed to give twenty - four - hours ' notice before taking a day off . ""Vanessa
45952	45957	45958	45958	She	1209	" I reminded her . "
45966	46156	46161	46161	Sam	212	" From what I knew , Vanessa was having a long - distance affair with a guy from Atlanta , and she went to visit him at least once a month . She would n't tell anyone his name or what he did , but she had dropped heavy hints to me that he was extremely rich and powerful , and she had him wrapped around her finger , of course . I could n't have cared less about who Vanessa was dating , but I tried to look impressed to keep from offending her . Vanessa seemed to expect me to be fascinated by the mundane details of her life . Sometimes she repeated the same stories , like the one about being caught in traffic , or what her masseur had said about what great shape she was in , two and three times , even when I reminded her she 'd already told me . I was certain it was deliberate , although I could n't figure out why she did it , or why I seemed to be the only one she did this to . "Is

46567	46678	46564	46565	Miss Travis	125	"I did a quick , discreet check in a compact mirror , applied some tinted lip balm , and pushed the long bangs back from my forehead . I was wearing dark brown wool trousers and a matching V - neck wrap sweater . Unfortunately I had chosen flats for comfort that day . If I 'd known I would see Hardy Cates , I would have worn my tallest heels to give him less of a height advantage . I looked into Samantha 's file on Hardy and skimmed the prequalification report , and nearly dropped it as I saw the numbers . When Hardy said his company was doing "
46681	46706	46564	46565	Miss Travis	125	" he had neglected to mention that he was in the process of becoming obscenely rich . That property in the Gulf they were getting "
46709	46859	46860	46861	Mr. Cates	126	" out of must have been a major find . A really major find . Hardy Cates was on his way to becoming a big - time oilman . I was certainly the last person who could hold that against him . My father had huge ties to the oil industry . And even my oldest brother , with his alternative energy company , had n't cut fossil fuels entirely from his repertoire . Sighing , I closed the file and took the elevator to the residential lobby . Hardy was sitting in a black leather chair near the concierge 's desk , talking with David . He saw me and stood , and my heart began to thump so hard that I felt a little light - headed . I put on a business face , a business smile , and extended a hand as I reached him . "
46863	46868	46860	46861	Mr. Cates	126	""Hello , Miss Travis . "A

As I got into the elevator and turned to face out , I saw that both women had glanced back for a better look at Hardy . I had to admit , the man looked amazing in jeans . The ancient denim clung lightly to his hips and followed the long lines of some remarkable thigh muscles . And although I made a point of not checking out his rear view , my peripheral vision was having a very good day . I pushed the button for the eighteenth floor . As the elevator whooshed up , we occupied separate corners . Hardy studied me with frank interest . His blue cashmere sweater lay softly over the hard lines of his torso . "
47222	47240	47241	47242	Miss Travis	125	"I decided we had to go on a first - name basis . He 'd started to say "
47243	47255	47241	47242	Miss Travis	125	" with a touch of overdone respect that bordered on mockery . "

47798	47905	47795	47795	you	0	" I said , leading him to the apartment . Stopping at the door , I began to punch numbers into the combination touch pad . I was suffused with an intense awareness of Hardy , so big and solid beside me . There was that scent again , insanely distracting . I punched the last button , barely aware of what I was doing . Although I had used the combination pad a thousand times while I 'd stayed there with Gage and Liberty , I must have hit a wrong number . Instead of clicking open , the lock emitted a series of beeps . "Sorry

Whenever she was around , she sent out discreet signals that she was angling for some kind of relationship that went beyond business . Thankfully , he did n't seem interested .

52230	52277	52216	52217	Beebe Whitney	174	" Todd asked . Back in high school , Beebe had been the most beautiful girl at Lamar , not to mention head cheerleader and class princess . She had been married in one of Houston 's biggest weddings ever and had divorced eleven months later . "No

52650	52713	52714	52714	Hello	175	"Todd had an unerring ability to read people , to ferret out the secrets they gave away without even knowing it .

52716	52745	52714	52714	Hello	175	" I said tentatively as we went inside the apartment . Hardy came to meet us , his gaze flicking over me , then settling on my face . "
52748	52866	52867	52867	I	0	" He smiled and reached for my hand . He held it a little too long , his thumb sliding into the cup of my palm before I tugged free . He was wearing a designer suit , a beautiful dress shirt , a good watch . His tie was a little loose , as if he 'd been tugging at it , and his hair fell in mink - brown layers that practically begged to be touched and played with . He looked good in the civilized attire , but there was still a touch of the bruiser about him , a sense that he was not meant be bound up in a suit and tie . "Can
52873	52898	52900	52900	I	0	" he asked Todd , who was burdened with a stack of materials including a portfolio , sample books , sketches , and folders . "Nope

53132	53173	53182	53182	Todd	107	" As Hardy walked around the counter to join him , Todd turned to me and mouthed a silent Wow , his turquoise eyes sparkling with glee . I ignored him . The two men bent over the sample book . "
53186	53225	53182	53182	Todd	107	" Earth tones , caramels , botanical greens , some pumpkin orange here and there for pop . This would be a really comfortable environment . And it would definitely soften the sterility of the finish in here . "They

53674	53724	53729	53729	them	1325	" There was no business with more phallic terminology than the oil business . After being exposed to three minutes of conversation about drilling , holes , fluids , and pumping , even a Benedictine nun would have dirty thoughts . Todd and I were silent , listening avidly . "

She wore the same serene mask as always , but when it was just the two of us in her office , she had "
54935	55057	55058	55058	She	1344	" knocked over her pencil holder and asked me to pick all of them up . And then she dropped a file folder , and asked me to collect the papers that had flown everywhere . I could n't accuse her of doing it on purpose . After all , everyone had moments of clumsiness . But I knew it had n't been accidental . And the sight of me on my hands and knees had definitely improved her mood . She seemed almost jovial by the time I 'd finished putting the file back together . I realized that in a very short period of time , I had acquired a new person in my life to be afraid of . "

You had to look awed by everything they did , and miss no opportunity to flatter or praise them . Basically , you had to sell out in every conceivable way , until there was nothing left of your dignity , self - respect , or your soul .

CHAPTER NINEVanessa 's warning about staying away from the tenants had n't been necessary . I had already decided to take Todd 's assessment of Hardy to heart . I was n't going anywhere near him . My rebound guy , when and if I found one , was not going to be manipulative or twisty twisted . He was going to be someone I could handle , someone who would n't overwhelm me . And although Hardy was only about seven or eight years older than me , he 'd had infinitely more experience in just about every way . As far as sex was concerned , he 'd gone "

But the day after Hardy had moved into 1800 Main , I found a wrapped package on my desk , tied with a neat red ribbon . Since it was n't my birthday or any gift - giving holiday I could think of , I was mystified . Kimmie stood at the entryway of my cubicle . "

56531	56539	56661	56661	She	150	" Kimmie gave me a skeptical glance . "
56562	56624	56626	56627	a visitor	1366	"It was no surprise , of course , when Vanessa came straight to my cubicle when she returned . She was dressed in a pristine white skirt suit , with an ice - pink blouse that matched her nails and delicately glossed lips . I tensed as she half sat on the edge of my desk , looking down at me . "We
56633	56640	56626	56627	a visitor	1366	" she remarked with a smile . "

57014	57073	56981	56981	Kimmie	151	" Vanessa prompted , as I hesitated before lifting the lid . Before I could stop myself , a huge , irrepressible smile spread across my face as I opened the case . It was a tool kit complete with a pink - handled hammer , a tape measure , a screwdriver , and a set of wrenches . "A
57077	57082	56981	56981	Kimmie	151	" Kimmie asked blankly . "
57089	57176	56981	56981	Kimmie	151	"Even Vanessa looked disappointed . No doubt she had been hoping for something scandalous or compromising , or at least expensive . But the gift of a tool kit was hardly something to indicate a hot affair . Unfortunately in my case , this was more effective than a trunkload of diamonds . It suggested that Hardy Cates understood me , got me , in a way no man ever had . Not even Nick . That scared me almost as much as it pleased me . "Nice
57178	57241	57250	57250	you	1373	" I said blandly , turning to hide my hot cheeks . I closed the tool kit and set it on the floor beside my desk . Vanessa stayed at my desk until everyone else had gone back to work . I could feel her gaze on the back of my head . I ignored her , blindly studying my laptop screen . "You
57252	57267	57250	57250	you	1373	" I heard her say in an undertone that no one else could hear . "
57283	57560	57272	57272	him	308	"I convinced myself that the only decent thing to do was to thank Hardy for the gift . So I went up to his apartment after dinner that night , hoping he would be gone . My plan was to leave a bottle of wine and a note on the threshold , and avoid any actual contact with him . But as I walked out of the elevator on the eighteenth floor , I saw Hardy punching the combination code on the door lock . He had just finished a workout — he must have gone to the fitness center on the sixth floor — and he was wearing sweatpants and a damp T - shirt that clung to every line of his body . He was built but not beefy , just . . . powerful . Ripped . I could see indentations of muscle all down his back . His biceps strained the sleeves of his shirt . The hair at the back of his neck was sweat soaked . A sheen of exertion covered his skin . He was a big , steaming male , and I could almost smell the salt and fresh sweat and hot skin from where I stood . I felt the confusing , opposing pulls of repulsion and craving . I wanted to taste him . I wanted to put my mouth on him , any part of him . I also wanted to run as fast as possible in the opposite direction . I managed to smile , clutching the bottle of wine against my front , as he turned to glance at me over his shoulder . "Hey
57562	57573	57689	57689	his	1374	" he said softly , his gaze locking on mine . "Hey
57575	57621	57689	57689	his	1374	" It seemed to take an absurdly long time to reach him , as if the hallway had become a conveyor belt moving In the opposite direction . When I finally got to him , I held out the wine bottle in an awkward motion . "
57625	57629	57689	57689	his	1374	" I said . "
57638	57645	57634	57634	I	0	" He pushed the door open . "
57649	57661	57666	57666	he	1374	""No , thanks , I just wanted to give you this — "

57720	57826	57689	57689	his	1374	" I followed Hardy into the apartment . He switched the lights on , and I almost gasped at the change in the place . It had been transformed into a rustic but sophisticated retreat . The rich earthy tones of the wood and upholstery played off the abundant row of windows . The furniture had been kept to a minimum , a few comfortable oversized pieces , including a deep sofa and chairs and a low , flat ottoman upholstered in caramel - colored leather . A stylized three - panel painting depicting a cattle drive had been mounted on one wall . Perfect . "Whatever
57831	57835	57827	57827	you	1374	" I said , "

57912	57921	57849	57849	Hardy	124	" Hardy set the bottle onto the counter . "
57940	57967	57969	57969	Hardy	124	""It 's very subtle . Sometimes it helps if you hold the wine in your mouth and let it warm to your body temperature . . . "

58103	58120	58064	58064	he	124	"Hardy leaned over me , all brawn and hormones , bracing a hand on the wall . "
58127	58132	58122	58122	anyone	414	" he asked conversationally , "

Nothing would show , he said , as long as no one stood above me and looked straight down my back . As I had expected , most of my family was there , including Dad , Liberty , and all three of my brothers . Liberty looked ravishing in a red silk gown , the shimmering fabric draped and twisted all around her voluptuous body . "I

I needed to think about things , including the question of why , in spite of my better judgment and my family 's conviction that it was a mistake , I was still attracted to Hardy Cates . But before I was even aware I was doing it , I had gone to the bar . It was easy to locate Hardy 's tall , rangy form . He was half leaning against the bar , a rocks glass in his hand . It appeared he was talking to someone , although his shoulder blocked the view . I approached him hesitantly , tilting my head a little as I tried to get a glimpse of his companion . He was talking to a woman . Naturally . It was inconceivable that a man with his looks would n't attract female attention . The woman was slim and busty and dressed in a sparkling gold gown . All that , along with her light blond hair , made her look like an awards show statuette . I stiffened as I saw her face . "Hi
61595	61632	61593	61593	Vanessa	150	" I said weakly . CHAPTER TENVanessa Flint gave me a look I was familiar with , the one that said she did n't want to be interrupted . But her voice was warm and friendly . "

But his grip , firm as it was , was not painful . I forced myself to relax and go along with him as he steered me through the crowd . A female singer was crooning "
62134	62217	62035	62035	he	0	" the dark , moody melody weaving around us like smoke . I was in a daze as we made our way out of the room , past the crush in the lobby . We reached a set of doors , but we were forced to stop as someone stepped in our way . Gage . His eyes flashed like bottled lightning as he glanced over both of us , missing no detail , including the way Hardy was gripping my wrist . "Do
62222	62238	62218	62218	you	1456	" Gage asked me quietly . Hardy looked like he was ready to commit murder . "
62243	62309	62218	62218	you	1456	" he said . My brother paid no attention to that , only kept his gaze on me . I felt a wave of gratitude for him , understanding how difficult it was for him to let me go off with a man he despised . But Gage knew it was my choice . He was there to offer help only if I wanted it . "It
62313	62319	62320	62320	I	0	" I said to him . "
62326	62467	62320	62320	I	0	"My brother nodded , although it was obvious he was struggling not to interfere . As we left him , he looked as if he were watching me walk off with Lucifer himself . I knew Gage was afraid for me . He did n't trust Hardy Cates . Neither did I , come to think of it . Hardy pulled me past the set of doors , and around a corner , working deeper into the building until we finally stopped in some kind of maintenance stairwell , which smelled of concrete and metal and musty dankness . It was quiet except for a dripping sound , and the broken rhythms of our breathing . A light from somewhere above shed uncertain fluorescence over us . Hardy faced me , looking huge and dark against a background of concrete . "

I pushed at him , and his mouth lifted , and he muttered something that sounded obscene , but I could n't quite hear it over the rampaging pulse in my ears . He took my head in both his hands , fingers shaping around my skull . His lips found mine again . The taste and heat of him were unbearably sweet as his tongue sank into my mouth . The pleasure of it went screaming through me , hunger striking against equal hunger , creating fire . I opened to him , shaking so hard I could barely stand . His arm went around me , shielding my back from the cold press of concrete , the other hand running down the front of my body . I kissed him back , licking into his mouth the way he was doing with mine . I was feeling too much , losing control . His mouth broke from mine , roughly searching the side of my neck . The rasp of his shaven jaw sent bolts of delight down to my stomach . I heard him mutter something to the effect that after going to a fancy college I should at least be smart enough to know when a man wanted to go to bed with me . Except that he said it a lot more crudely . "I'm
62937	62953	62934	62935	a gentleman	1465	" he went on , gripping my body , his breath hot on my skin . "

He cupped the shallow weight , his thumb prodding the tip until it was tight and rosy , and then he bent to touch it with his tongue . I lifted , gasping , as he kissed the erect nipple , sealing his mouth over the taut flesh . He tugged rhythmically , sending washes of pleasure through me , licking between each soft pull . I held his head to me , tears stinging the corners of my eyes because it felt so good . He moved upward and fastened his mouth to mine again , the kiss rich and drugging . "

The other part of me craved this , being held , being touched . He stroked my hair , fingertips moving gently over the curve of my scalp . I felt something giving way , some inner tightness dissolving . We swayed a little as we stood together , as if sensation were an ocean current pushing against us . Hardy nuzzled into my neck . I twisted to find his mouth , and he gave me what I wanted , kissing me with slow hunger until I was weak and dizzy . His arm was strong around me , cradling and supportive . With his free hand , he clenched his fingers into the loose folds of my dress , easing the knit fabric upward . I jumped as his hand clasped my bare hip . He kissed my throat and said things I only half heard , endearments , reassurance , soothing me while he parted my thighs . He touched me , opening tenderly , one fingertip moving over layered flesh in teasing circles , smaller and smaller until he reached the center . I writhed helplessly as he caressed that one pulsing spot , over and over , and every time the callus on his finger crossed the wet surface of my clit , a pleasure - cry rose in my throat . I melted on him , moaning , while the need for sex , to be filled , pulsed all through me . Turning my mouth to his , I let him kiss me as deeply as he wanted , welcoming the aggressive thrust of his tongue . His hand left me , and he reached for the fastenings of his pants . . . and it was then that disaster struck . As I felt him so huge and hard against me , all the pleasure disappeared . Just . . . vanished . Suddenly all I could see , hear , feel , was that last time with Nick , the searing pain , the brutal thrusts eased only by the slick of my own blood . My throat and stomach pulsed with nausea , and the masculine body against mine was revolting , his weight unbearable , and I began to struggle without thinking . "No

Somehow I found my way back to the modular theater , the sounds of dancing and laughter swirling around me . I was terrified by the realization of how much was wrong with me , that I could n't tolerate the normal act of having sex with a man I was attracted to . And I was humiliated by the way I had just behaved . Hardy had no choice but to think I was a bitch , a cocktease . He would never want anything to do with me again . That thought sort of relieved me , but at the same time I wanted to burst into tears . Todd found me immediately . He had been talking with a guy at the bar , his gaze leisurely sweeping the room , when he saw me come in . He came to me , his gaze focused on my pale face and kiss - swollen lips . "

68326	68548	68256	68256	I	0	"With most of the daytime occupants gone , the building was quiet and a little eerie , doors locked and windows darkened . Thunder was rumbling outside , making me shiver in my business suit . I was glad to be going home . One of my shoes was pinching , and the clasp of my side - zip pants was digging into my skin , and I was hungry . Most of all , J was anxious to reach Hardy and tell him how sorry I was for the previous night . And I was going to explain . . . something . I entered the elevator and pressed the button for the lowest garage level . The doors closed , and the cab descended smoothly . But as I reached the bottom , the floor beneath me gave a strange lurch , and I heard pops and snaps , and then everything went dead . The lights , the hydraulics , everything stopped . I let out a startled yelp as I was left in complete blackness . Worse , I heard the continuous splash of water , like someone had turned a faucet on inside the elevator . Concerned but not panicked , I felt for the panel beside the door , pushing a few buttons Nothing happened . "Phone
68550	68567	68256	68256	I	0	" I said aloud , trying to reassure myself with the sound of my own voice . "
68577	68870	68256	68256	I	0	" My groping fingers found an elevator speaker phone with a push button , all of it embedded in the wall . I pushed the button , held it , but there was no response . I counted myself lucky that I was n't one of those people with elevator phobias . I was remaining calm . Methodically I went through my briefcase to find my cell phone . Something icy swept over my foot . At first I thought it was a draft , but a second later I felt the wet chill in my pumps , and I realized there were a couple of inches of water inside the elevator cab . Carefully I pulled out the cell phone and flipped it open . I used it as a makeshift flashlight , shining the tiny glowing screen at my surroundings to see where the water was coming in . Oily - looking water was spurting through the seam of the closed elevator doors . That was bad enough . But as I moved the glow of the cell phone upward , I saw that it was n't just coming in through the bottom of the doors . It was coming through the top . As if the entire elevator car were submerged . But that was n't possible . There was no way the shaft could be filled with eight or nine feet of water . . . would n't that mean most of the lower garage was flooded ? That could n't have happened in the time since I 'd arrived at the building . But shit . . . an elevator shaft full of water would explain why all the electrical systems seemed to have short - circuited . "This
68874	68961	68256	68256	I	0	" I muttered , my heartbeat picking up anxious speed as I dialed the building 's main number . It rang twice , and then a recorded message began to list extension numbers from the main directory . As soon as I heard the three digits for the security office , I punched them in . Another two rings . . . and then a busy signal . Swearing , I redialed the main number and tried Kelly 's extension . An answering machine picked up . "
68997	69009	69010	69010	Kelly	196	"I left a message , trying to sound professional but urgent . "
69049	69127	69041	69041	security	1533	"Water kept pouring in , swirling around my ankles . As I ended the call , I saw that the low battery signal on my phone was flashing . With hardly any juice left , I was n't going to take any chances . I dialed 911 , watching my finger as if it belonged to someone else . And I listened , incredulous , as the line was picked up and directed to a recorded message . "
69154	69296	69371	69371	you	124	" I held , waited for a minute that seemed to last a lifetime , and ended the call when it was clear nothing was going to happen . I dialed it again with excruciating care . . . 9 - 1 - 1 . . . and this time I got nothing but a busy signal . My phone beeped to let me know the battery was almost dead . With the water now midway up my calves and pouring in continuously , I stopped pretending that I was anything close to calm . Somehow I managed to bring the list of recently received calls to the phone screen . I pressed the return on Hardy 's last call . It rang . Once . . . twice . . . I gasped with relief as I heard his voice . "Cates
69298	69300	69301	69301	I	0	""Hardy , "
69313	69326	69301	69301	I	0	" It 's me . I need you . I need help . "He

69361	69367	69368	69368	Hardy	124	" The phone beeped again . "
69373	69377	69371	69371	you	124	me?""Say it again . ""An
69403	69419	69371	69371	you	124	" The phone beeped and went dead . I was left in darkness once more . "
69422	69429	69371	69371	you	124	" I half screamed in frustration . "
69435	69501	69433	69433	Hardy	124	Hardy?"Nothing but silence . And gushing , splashing water . I felt hysteria welling up , and I actually considered whether or not to give in to it . But since there was nothing to be gained by it , and I was pretty sure it was n't going to make me feel any better , I shoved it back down and took deep breaths . "People
69508	70105	70106	70107	someone there	2279	" I said aloud . The water had reached my knees , and it was biting cold . It also smelled bad , like oil and chemicals and sewage . I pulled my computer from my briefcase , opened it , and tried in vain to get any kind of Internet signal . At least with the glowing screen open , it was n't completely dark in the elevator . I looked at the ceiling , which was covered in wood paneling and tiny recessed lights , all out . Was n't there supposed to be an escape hatch ? Maybe it was concealed . I could n't think of any way to get up there and search for it . I waded to the side of the door and tried the phone panel again , as well as all the buttons , and nothing happened . Taking off one of my pumps , I used the heel to bang on the walls and shout for help for a few minutes . By the time I got tired of pounding , I was submerged up to my hips . I was so cold that my teeth were chattering and the bones in my legs were aching . Except for the water pouring in , everything was quiet . It was calm everywhere except inside my head . I realized I was in a coffin . I was actually going to die in this metal box . I'd heard it was n't supposed to be a bad way to die , drowning . There were worse ways to go . But it was so unfair — I had never done anything with my life that was worth putting in an obituary . I had n't accomplished any of the goals I 'd had at college . I 'd never made peace with my father , not in a real sense . I 'd never helped people who were less fortunate . I 'd never even had decent sex . I was certain that people facing death should be occupied with noble thoughts , but instead I found myself thinking about those moments in the stairwell with Hardy . If I 'd gone through with it , at least I would have had good sex for once in my life . But I 'd blown even that . I wanted him . I wanted so much . Nothing was finished in my life . I stood there , waiting for my eventual drowning not with resignation but milling fury . When the water had reached the bottom edge of my bra , I was tired of holding the computer up , and I let it sink . It submerged and floated to the elevator floor in water so polluted you could barely see the glowing screen before it shorted out and went dark . It was disorienting , the cold blackness all around me . Huddling in the corner , I leaned my head against the wall and breathed , and waited . I wondered what it would feel like when there was no more air left and I had to pull water into my lungs . The sound of a sharp bang on 1the ceiling caused a start that went through me like a bullet . I turned my head from one side to the other , sightless and scared . Bang . Scraping , sliding noises , tools against metal . The ceiling creaked , and the entire elevator rocked as if it were a rowboat . "Is
70109	70141	70106	70107	someone there	2279	" I called out , my pulse thundering . I heard the muffled , distant sound of a human voice . Galvanized , I pounded the elevator wall with my fist . "
70148	70227	70106	70107	someone there	2279	here!"There was a reply I could n't hear . Whoever it was kept working on the top of the elevator , wrenching and prying until a raw shriek of metal filled the air . A portion of the wood paneling was ripped back . I flattened myself against the wall as I heard cracking and splintering , debris splashing . And then the beam of a flashlight shot into the dark elevator cab , bouncing off the water . "I'm
70230	70240	70241	70241	I	0	" I said with a sob , sloshing forward . "

As he came into the cab with a controlled drop , the floor shifted and the level of water came up . I sloshed through the heavy water , leaping on him , climbing halfway up his body before he could even move . Hardy caught me in a firm grip , one arm sliding beneath my bottom , the other strong and solid around my back . "

72031	72153	72028	72029	a monkey	1581	" Reaching into his back pocket , Hardy extracted a wallet and fished out some dripping cash , apologizing for the condition it was in . They chuckled and assured him the money was still good , and they all shook hands . I stood with my arms clutched around Hardy as he spoke with the elevator technician and security office supervisor for a couple of minutes . Even though I was safe , I could n't make myself let go of him . And he did n't seem to mind that I had attached myself to him , only ran his hand over my back now and then . A fire truck pulled up outside the building , lights flashing . "Listen
72155	72170	72028	72029	a monkey	1581	" Hardy said to the security supervisor , handing him a soggy business card . "

72245	72271	72215	72216	the supervisor	2970	" I said as Hardy guided me out of the building , right past the fire truck and a van with a camera crew emerging . "He
72281	72316	72274	72274	you	1586	" Hardy replied , leading me to his car , which had been double - parked . It was a gleaming silver Mercedes sedan , and the inside beige upholstery was buttery and perfect . "No
72318	72323	72274	72274	you	1586	" I said helplessly . "
72339	72348	72352	72353	darlin '	1589	"Hardy opened the door and manhandled me inside . "
72361	72474	72355	72355	We	1590	"I cringed every second of the short drive to 1800 Main , knowing we were ruining the interior of his car . And there was worse to come . After Hardy parked in the garage beneath our building , we approached the elevator that went to the lobby . I stopped like I 'd been shot , and looked from the elevator to the stairs . Hardy stopped with me . The absolute last thing I wanted to do was in get back on another elevator . It was too much . I felt every muscle tense in rejection of the idea . Hardy was silent , letting me struggle through it . "
72477	72482	72355	72355	We	1590	" I choked out . "
72496	72500	72501	72501	Hardy	124	I?""Not in Houston . "

72587	72630	72583	72583	I	0	" So . . . thank you . And I want you to know , I 'm not usually . . . troublesome . I mean , I 'm not one of those women who needs to be rescued all the time . ""You
72637	72874	72583	72583	I	0	"That actually pulled a smile from me despite my anxiety . It was exactly the right thing to say . The doors opened , and I just did it , made myself walk into the metal box , and I hunched into the corner as Hardy followed . Before the doors had closed , Hardy had pulled me into a tight - bodied clinch , length to length , and our mouths came together , and it seemed as if everything I had felt that day , anguish , anger , desperation , and relief , all surged to a flash point of pure white heat . I responded with frantic kisses , pulling his tongue into my mouth , wanting the taste and feel of him all over me . Hardy gave a short , sharp pant , as if taken unawares by my response . He gripped my head in his hand and his mouth worked over mine , hungry and sweet . In a matter of seconds we were at the lobby . The doors opened with an annoying beep . Hardy pulled away and tugged me out of the elevator , into the shining black marble lobby . I was sure we looked like a pair of swamp creatures as we went past the concierge desk to the main residential elevator . David , the concierge , gaped as he saw us . "

72954	72984	72951	72952	Miss Travis	125	" he said , a little too quickly . And as we went to the residential elevator , I saw him pick up his phone and start to dial . "He
72991	73001	72989	72989	Jack	97	" I said , trudging into the open elevator . "
73018	73292	72989	72989	Jack	97	" But Hardy was kissing me again , this time bracing his hands on the wall on either side of me as if I were too dangerous to be touched . The hot openmouthed kiss went on and on , and the pleasure of it was overpowering . I reached up and let my hands follow the thick slope of his shoulders , the muscles bunched and rigid . I was dimly amazed by the effect of my hands on him , the way his mouth locked on mine as if he were desperately feasting on something that might be taken away . He was aroused , and I actually wanted to touch him there , put my hand on that heavy bulge . My trembling fingers slid over the flat reach of his stomach , crossing the warm metal buckle of his belt . But the elevator stopped , and Hardy gripped my wrist , tugging it back . His eyes were a hot , soft blue , his color high as if with fever . He gave a shake of his head to clear it , and pulled me from the elevator . We were at the eighteenth floor . His apartment . I went with him willingly , waiting at the door as he entered the combination . He misdialed , causing it to beep indignantly . I bit back a grin as he swore . He gave me a wry glance and tried again , and the door opened . Taking me by the hand as if I were a small child , Hardy led me to the shower . "

73330	73564	73320	73320	I	0	"No shower had ever been as good as that one . I doubted any future ones would even come close . I turned the water temperature up to near - scalding , groaning with pleasure as it rushed over my cold , aching limbs . I washed and rinsed my body and shampooed my hair three times . Hardy 's robe was too big for me , trailing the floor by at least a half - foot . I wrapped myself in it , in the scent that was now becoming familiar . I tied the belt tightly , rolled the sleeves up several times , and looked at myself in the steam - slicked mirror . My hair had sprung up in curls . Since there were no styling tools other than a brush or comb , there was no help for that . I would have expected to feel drained after what I 'd experienced , but instead I felt alive , overstimulated , the soft terry of the robe abrasive on my tender skin . Wandering to the main room , I saw Hardy dressed in jeans and a white T - shirt , his hair still wet from his shower . He was standing at the table , pulling sandwiches and containers of soup from a paper bag . His gaze took inventory of me from head to toe . "

75511	75606	75608	75608	his	1623	" My dad broke it . He was a drinker . Drunk or sober , I think the only time he ever felt good was when he was hurting someone . He cut out on the family when I was still young . I wish to hell he 'd stayed away for good . But he came back now and then , whenever he was n't in jail . He would beat the hell out of Mama , knock her up , and light out again with every cent he could steal from her . "He
75615	75761	75507	75507	he	0	" My mother 's a tall woman , but there 's not much to her . A strong wind could knock her over . I knew he 'd kill her someday . One of the times he came back , I was about eleven — I told him do n't even try , he was n't going near her . I do n't remember what happened next , only that I woke up on the floor feeling like I 'd been stomped by a rodeo bull . And my nose was broken . Mama was beat up nearly as bad as I was . She told me never to go against Dad again . She said trying to fight back only made him mad . It was easier on her if we just let him have his way , and then he 'd be gone . ""Why
75781	75860	75861	75861	Hardy	124	something?""A restraining order only works if you handcuff yourself to a cop . And my mother thought it best to take her problems to her church . They convinced her not to divorce him . They said it was her special mission to save his soul . According to the minister , we should all make it a matter of prayer , that Dad 's heart would turn , that he 'd see the light and be saved . "
75865	75883	75861	75861	Hardy	124	" If I 'd had any hopes of being a religious man , they disappeared after that . "I
75929	75935	75926	75926	I	0	" So what happened to your dad?""He
75984	76025	75982	75982	He	124	" Hardy stopped and rubbed his mouth and jaw slowly , and would n't look at me . I was filled with the electrifying awareness that he had been about to tell me something he 'd never told anyone before . "Go
76028	76032	76035	76035	me	0	" I whispered . "He
76084	76090	76078	76078	He	124	" His face was taut . "
76108	76114	76097	76097	Mama	111	""Why ? Was she mad at you?""I
76152	76163	76143	76143	she	111	" He looked at me then , and said quietly , "
76172	76238	76240	76240	he	93	"I could tell he meant it as a warning . And I understood something about him , that he had always used this notion of being from bad stock as a reason to keep from getting too close to anyone . Because letting someone in close meant they could hurt you . I knew all about that kind of fear . I lived with it . "Where
76244	76249	76240	76240	he	93	" I asked thickly . "
76253	76692	76240	76240	he	93	"Hardy stared at me with the glazed concentration of a drunken man , but I knew it had nothing to do with the Jack Daniel 's . A flush had crossed the crests of his cheeks and the bridge of his nose . He tugged at the bottom of his T - shirt until it revealed the taut flesh of his side . A thin scar showed white against the silky tan . And he watched , transfixed , as I slipped out of my chair and knelt before him , and leaned between his thighs to kiss the scar . He stopped breathing . His skin was hot against my lips , his leg muscles so tense they felt like iron . I heard a groan above my head , and I was plucked from between his knees as if I were a rag doll . Hardy carried me to the sofa , laid me out on the velvet upholstery , and knelt beside me while tugging at the belt of the robe . His mouth covered mine , burning and whiskey - sweet as he pulled the front of the robe apart . His hand was warm as he touched my breast , cupping beneath the soft curve , plumping it high for his mouth . His lips covered the tight peak , and he drew his tongue over it in tender licks . I squirmed beneath him , unable to hold still . The nipple budded almost painfully , sensation darting to the fork of my body with every stroke and swirl . I moaned and put my arms around his head , my spine dissolving as he moved to the other breast . My fingers tangled in the silk of his hair , shaping to his skull . Blindly I urged his mouth back up to mine , and he took it savagely , as if he could n't get deep enough . The weight of his hand settled low on my stomach , spanning the soft curve . I felt the tip of his little finger resting on the edge of the dark triangle . Whimpering , I nudged upward . His hand slid lower , and as his fingertips played in the springy curls , my insides began to throb and close on the emptiness . Until that moment , I had never felt as if I could die from raw need . I moaned and pulled at his T - shirt . Hardy 's mouth returned to mine , licking at the sounds I made as if he could taste them . "

His mouth rubbed over my swollen lips , dragging gently . His hand slid from between my legs , and he gathered me in his arms as if he meant to lift me , but instead he just held me in a bundle of smoothness and trembling bones and gasping dampness . He dipped his head , kissing the arc of a knee , the plush give of a breast , the tight strain of my throat . "Take

79619	79761	79611	79611	I	0	"Some men were partial to their daughters . My dad was n't one of them . Maybe if we 'd spent more time together , Dad and I could have found common ground , but he 'd always been too busy , too driven . Dad had yielded the responsibility of daughter raising to Mother 's exclusive control , and no matter how she whittled and chipped , she had never been able to make a square peg fit into a round hole . My attitude had worsened the harder Mother tried to make me into the right kind of daughter . The possessions that had been deemed unfeminine — my slingshot , my cap pistol , my plastic cowboy - and - Indian set , the Rangers hat Joe had given me — had either disappeared or were given away . "
79768	79776	79762	79762	You	1664	" she had said when I complained . "
79786	80329	80331	80331	Dad	93	"Mother 's two sisters had been sympathetic to her plight , since it was obvious nothing could be done with me . But I thought they had taken some secret satisfaction in the situation . Even though their husbands had n't been able to afford to buy them a mansion in River Oaks , they had managed to produce my cousins Karma and Jaci and Susan , all perfect little ladies . But Mother , who 'd had everything in the world she wanted , had gotten stuck with me . I'd always known that I 'd never have gone to Wellesley if my mother were still living . She had been a staunch antifeminist , although I was n't sure if she even knew why . Maybe because the system had always worked well for her , a rich man 's wife . Or possibly because she believed you could never change the order of things , men 's natures being what they were , and she had n't been one to knock her head against the wall . And many women of her generation had believed there was virtue in tolerating discrimination . Whatever the reason , Mother and I had certainly had our differences . I felt guilty because her death had allowed me to have my own beliefs and go to the college I wanted . Dad had n't been happy about it , of course , but he 'd been too grief - stricken to argue about it . And it had probably been a relief for him to get me out of Texas . I called Dad on my way to River Oaks to make sure he was at home . Since my car had been totaled by the garage flooding , I was driving a rental car . I was greeted at the front door by the housekeeper , Cecily . She had worked for the Travises for as long as I could remember . She 'd been old even when I was a child , her face lined with grooves you could wedge a dime in . While Cecily headed off to the kitchen , I went to Dad , who was relaxing in the family room . The room was flanked by walk - in fireplaces on each side , and was big enough that you could park a personnel carrier in it . My father was at one end of the room , relaxing on a living room sofa with his feet propped up . Dad and I had n't spent any real time together since my divorce . We had seen each other only for short visits , with other people present . It seemed we both felt that getting through a private conversation was more trouble than it was worth . As I looked at my father , I realized he was getting old . His hair had gotten more white than gray , and his tobacco tan had faded , evidence that he was spending less time outdoors . And he had a sort of settled - in air , the look of a man who had stopped straining and hurrying to reach the next thing around the corner . "Hey
80333	80355	80331	80331	Dad	93	" I leaned down to kiss his cheek , and sat next to him . His dark eyes inspected me carefully . "

I woke up replaying the conversation we 'd had , and brooding over his lack of interest in any real father - daughter communication . It depressed me , realizing I was n't ever going to get the same kind of love from him that I was willing to give . So I called Todd and told him about the visit . "You

81904	81935	81827	81827	I	0	" My fingers curled tightly around the phone . I wondered what I was doing , agreeing to a date with Hardy Cates . My family would have a fit . "

81958	82180	81827	81827	I	0	"After he hung up , I sat quietly for a few minutes , thinking . I knew Dad would say I had no idea what I was getting into , going out with Hardy Cates . But when you started dating someone , you could never be sure what you were getting into . You had to give someone a chance to show you who he really was . . . and believe him when he did . I dressed in jeans and high heels and a daffodil - colored halter top with a sparkly pin anchoring one strap to the bodice . Using a straightening iron , I worked on my hair until it was shiny and the ends were all turned up . Since the weather was humid , I used a minimum of makeup , just a touch of mascara and cherry - colored lip stain . It occurred to me that I was a lot more nervous about the idea of sleeping with Hardy than I had been with Nick as a virgin . Probably because with the first guy , you figured you got a beginner 's pass . With the second one , however , something more would be expected . It had n't helped that I had recently taken a women's - magazine quiz entitled "
82187	82211	81827	81827	I	0	" and my score had put me in the category of Inhibited Babe , and had given all kinds of suggestions for enhancing my "
82215	82293	81827	81827	I	0	" most of which sounded unsanitary , uncomfortable , or just plain unsightly . By the time I heard the doorbell ring , a few minutes before six , the tension had collected until my entire skeleton felt like it had been fastened with tight metal screws . I opened the door . But it was n't Hardy . There stood my ex - husband , dressed in a suit and tie , perfectly groomed and smiling . "
82296	82472	82542	82542	David	165	" he said , and grabbed my arm before I could move . CHAPTER FOURTEENI reeled back , trying to break free , but he followed me across the threshold . Nick 's smile never wavered . I knocked his hand away from me and faced him , trying to keep the alarm from showing on my face . I was in the middle of a nightmare . I thought it could n't be real , except that misery and fear and anger were swarming over me like insects , and that feeling was all too familiar . It had been my reality for almost two years . Nick looked healthy , fit , a little heavier than he 'd been during our marriage . The new roundness of his face emphasized a boyishness that would n't sit well as he aged . But overall he gave the appearance of a clean - cut , prosperous , conservative guy . Only someone who knew him like I did would be aware of the monster inside . "I
82480	82498	82478	82478	Nick	92	"He gave a bemused laugh , as if my quiet hostility were coming out of left field . "

82554	82614	82542	82542	David	165	"I found out where you were working , and I went to your office . Just talked to your manager , Vanessa — she told me you lived here in the building .

82622	82675	82677	82677	you	1701	" I said tersely . Damn Vanessa ! I had told her enough about my past to make her aware that I was not on good terms with my former husband . No surprise that she would make use of any opportunity to cause trouble . Nick ventured farther into my apartment . "What
82680	82687	82677	82677	you	1701	" I asked , backing away . "Just

85110	85128	85101	85101	I	0	" I began on the placket of buttons , wincing at the sight of the bloodstained fabric . "

85165	85171	85172	85173	a man	388	say?""I never read the tag . ""Such
85175	85927	85172	85173	a man	388	" I undid another button . . . another . My fingers slowed , but did n't stop . I was undressing him . Hardy did n't move , just watched me , his amusement evaporating . His chest went rigid beneath the blinding - white undershirt , his breath coming faster as I made fumbling progress . I tugged the hem of the shirt free of his jeans , the thin fabric crumpled and warm from his body . Such a man . A good - looking , over - the - top male , trying so hard not to seem dangerous . . . he was absolutely tantalizing . My hands shook as I reached for the cuffs of his sleeves , pushing the buttons through the crisp starched layers of fabric . Hardy remained still as I tugged the shirt from his shoulders . When the shirt reached his wrists , he moved as if he were dreaming , slowly pulling his arms from the sleeves . He tossed the garment to the floor and reached for me . I went weak as his arms enclosed me , his mouth descending with hot , searching pressure . I reached around his back , beneath the T - shirt , finding the powerful muscles on either side of his spine . His lips slid to my throat , exploring gently until I squirmed and arched to get closer to him . Excitement roared through me , and I stopped thinking , stopped trying to control anything . Hardy lifted me until I was sitting on the small kitchen island , my legs dangling . I shut my eyes against the artificial glare of the overhead lights . His mouth came to mine , tender and devouring , while his hands closed over my thighs and stroked them apart . God , the way he kissed . It had never been like this with Nick , or anyone , this urgent heat that melted me at the core . My clothes felt too tight , the halter top cinched over my breasts , and I tugged frantically at the straps to be rid of it . Hardy pushed my hands away . I felt him working at the straps , unhooking the closures at the back . The halter top loosened and fell to my waist . My breasts felt heavy , achy , the tips turning hard as they were exposed to cool air . Hardy slid an arm behind my back to support my faltering weight . He bent over me , his mouth hot as he navigated the pale slope of my breast . His lips traveled slowly to the deep pink crest . A moan swelled in my throat as he suckled , nibbled , moving from one breast to the other . Gasping , I held his head to me , the hair like thick silk , the scent of him as fresh as vetiver . He pulled me up , his arm amazingly strong , and he cradled my head in one hand to feed on my mouth again . His fingers clamped on a nipple still damp from his tongue . I clutched at him , so close , needing more , just a little more . . .He seemed to understand . Murmuring against my throat , Hardy pulled at the fastenings of my jeans , unzipped them , began to tug them down over my hips . Then something in me snapped . I went cold for no reason , as if I 'd just been dropped into a glacier lake . I saw Nick 's face , felt Nick 's arms around me , his legs pushing between mine . There was a bolt of pain in my chest , like the beginning of a heart attack , and my gut roiled . I came apart , crying out and shoving at him , nearly falling off the island . Hardy caught me , lowering my feet to the floor , but I was too far gone at that point , snapping at him , no get away do n't touch me do n't , and I kicked and pushed and clawed away from him like a wild thing . I must have blanked out for a moment , because the next thing I knew , I was curled up on the sofa , and Hardy was standing over me . "Haven
85933	85973	85172	85173	a man	388	" he said , and kept repeating it until I obeyed . I saw blue eyes , not hazel . I focused on them desperately . Hardy had draped his discarded button - down shirt over my naked chest . "

86000	86046	86047	86047	I	0	"My stomach was cramping so painfully , I was certain I was going to throw up . But gradually the jerky breaths eased into longer ones , and the sickness faded . Hardy gave a curt nod when my breathing returned to something approaching normal . "

Hardy came to sit on the sofa beside me , laying one arm along the back of it . I flinched at his nearness , but I could n't look away from him . He was ridiculously virile in that damned white T - shirt , with that long body and those sun - baked muscles . Any woman would have to be out of her mind not to go to bed with him . "I

87732	87747	87713	87713	You	2225	" A pause , a curse , a deep breath . An intent stare . "
87754	87880	87749	87749	you	2225	now?"Before I even realized what I was doing , I had crawled into his lap . He gathered me close , cuddling and soothing , and the comforting felt so good that I almost wished I could keep crying . I nuzzled into the fragrant skin of his neck , finding the place where the shaven bristle of his jaw began . He turned his mouth to mine , easy and warm , and that was all it took to start me simmering again , my lips parting to welcome him . But even as I responded to his kiss , I felt the intimate pressure of him beneath me , and I stiffened . Hardy drew his head back , his eyes molten blue . "
87885	87897	87944	87945	the therapist	2615	" He nudged upward , the hard ridge pushing against me . "
87902	87940	87944	87945	the therapist	2615	nervous?"I squirmed and nodded , turning scarlet . But I did n't try to move off him , just sat there quivering . His hands traced down my shoulders and arms , caressing me through the shirt . "
87951	87987	87988	87988	I	0	help?"I could n't believe he 'd be willing to do that for me . I tried to imagine it , me and Hardy and Susan discussing my sex problems , and I shook my head . "
87995	88000	87988	87988	I	0	" I said desperately . "
88042	88043	87988	87988	I	0	" "
88055	88062	87988	87988	I	0	" Hardy looked almost comically appalled . "
88085	88101	88102	88102	Honey	217	" He drew in a quick breath as I shifted my weight on his lap . "
88104	88112	88102	88102	Honey	217	" he said in a strained voice , "
88137	88252	88253	88253	Haven	131	"A warm pulse throbbed where we pressed , our flesh fitting exactly . I realized I was n't quite as nervous , now that I 'd had a few moments to get used to him . I settled a little deeper on him . Hardy closed his eyes and made a guttural sound . I saw the colorheighten in his face . And I felt a rearing response in the thick pressure beneath me . Hardy 's lashes lifted , his eyes bluer than usual against his rich rosewood tan . He glanced at the front of my shirt — his shirt — where it gaped open to reveal the space between my breasts . "
88257	88263	88253	88253	Haven	131	" His voice was hoarse . "
88310	88378	88387	88387	you	0	"But later was too late . I wanted to figure it out right then . I felt the heat coming off him , and I saw the mist of sweat on his throat , and I longed to kiss him . I wanted to give him pleasure . And please , God , I wanted at least one good memory to replace one of the bad ones . "Hardy
88380	88385	88387	88387	you	0	" I said tentatively , "
88394	88424	88387	88387	you	0	little?"A smile touched his mouth . He reached out and pulled the sides of the shirt closed , and used the backs of his fingers to stroke my cheek . "

88561	88910	88911	88911	I	0	"Without another word Hardy plucked me from his lap , set me on my feet , and followed me to the bedroom . My bed was an old - fashioned brass one , the sturdy , stately kind that weighed a ton and did n't move an inch . It was covered in cream linen , and the pillows were made of lace taken from antique wedding dresses . In the feminine surroundings of my bedroom , Hardy looked even bigger and more masculine than usual . Such a normal act , two people going to bed together . But for me it was invested with far too much significance , too much emotion , too much everything . The air - conditioning imparted a soft chill to the room , the lace on the pillows fluttering like moth wings as the ceiling fan turned overhead . An antique Victorian lamp shed amber light across the bed . I tried to seem casual , sitting on the bed and working at the tiny straps of my high - heeled sandals . I wished I were n't stone - cold sober . A glass of wine might have loosened me up a little . Maybe it was n't too late . Maybe I should suggest — Hardy sat beside me , reached for my foot , and unfastened the miniature buckle . He squeezed my bare foot and ran his thumb along the arch before taking off the other shoe . Sliding an arm around me , he eased us both back onto the bed . I waited tensely for him to start . But Hardy only held me , warming me with his body , fitting an arm beneath my neck . One hand traveled over my back and waist and hips , up to the nape of my neck , as if I were a skittish animal . And it went on until the petting and soothing had lasted longer than any sex act I had ever engaged in with Nick . Hardy spoke against my hair . "

89613	89689	89593	89593	honey	2125	" He urged me over to my front , and I felt his mouth on my back , kissing and nibbling along my spine . But I stiffened as I remembered how Nick used to take me from behind . His favorite position . All the thumping excitement died away , and I broke out in an anxious sweat . Hardy 's mouth lifted from my skin , and he turned me to face him . "Scared
89691	89712	89713	89713	I	0	" he murmured , his hand skimming over my arm . I nodded with a mixture of defeat and frustration . "
89733	89898	89730	89730	me	0	" I stopped , wondering bleakly if I was ever going to get Nick out of my head , if I would ever be able to forget what he had done . The bad memories had been woven into the fabric of my body , threaded through every nerve . Nick had ruined me for life . Hardy continued to stroke my arm . There was a distance in his gaze , as if he were turning a thought over in his mind . I realized he was considering how to handle me , how to slip past my defenses , and that made me feel apologetic and wary . His hand wandered from my arm to my chest , his fingertips circling the breasts that Nick had complained were too small . Damn it . There was no way the good feeling was going to come back . I could n't stop thinking about my ex - husband , or my own inadequacies . "

His mouth descended , trailing kisses from my chest to my stomach . His tongue slipped inside the tight hollow of my navel , and I squirmed in response . His hand settled on one of my knees . "
89993	90014	89919	89919	your	0	" he whispered again , sliding lower until my eyes flew open . I jerked and pushed at his head . "Wait

90031	90056	90025	90025	I	0	" I was blushing furiously , trembling all over . Hardy 's head lifted , the soft light running over his hair like liquid . "

91739	91759	91680	91680	I	0	"I drew my hands over his sides , his back , the muscles coiled and strong beneath my fingertips . "
91765	91846	91680	91680	I	0	"He began a careful rhythm , rooting out pleasure from the intimate channel where we were joined . One of his thrusts stroked a sensitive place , deep and low , and at the same time his body pressed the front of mine at just the right angle . A zing of delight went through me . I jerked in surprise and dug my fingers into Hardy 's hips . He lifted his head and smiled into my wide eyes . "
91854	92069	91848	91848	I	0	" he whispered , and did it again , and again , and to my everlasting embarrassment I could n't keep quiet , groans climbing in my throat until my hips shuddered against his . This time the spasms were n't as intense , but they were long and slow , pulling at the length of him until he came . He buried the pleasure sounds in my mouth , and kissed me , and kissed me , stopping only when we were both oxygen deprived and completely spent . I was filled with an overpowering drowsiness after that . I dozed for a while , with his body still tucked inside mine , and I discovered that the sleep after good sex was almost better than the sex itself . I woke later with him hard inside me , not thrusting , just wedged deep , and his hands were wandering everywhere , stroking and massaging . I lay on my side , one leg hitched over his hip . I wanted , needed him to move , but he kept me impaled and still . I gripped his bicep , his shoulder , trying to pull him over me . He resisted , letting me wriggle like a worm on a hook . "Hardy
92071	92083	91848	91848	I	0	" I muttered , sweating at the roots of my hair . "

92093	92120	92121	92121	You	1769	" He licked at my upper lip , then the lower one . I rocked against him and pulled my mouth free long enough to gasp , "
92124	92479	92121	92121	You	1769	"He pressed his mouth into my neck . I felt the curve of his smile . Yes , he knew . But he continued to hold me locked against him while I clenched over and over , pulling at the deep pulse of him . Finally he gave me a hint of a thrust , more a suggestion of movement than an actual rhythm . It was enough though . It tipped me past the flash point , inner muscles contracting to gather sensation , and I came in rough shivers . Hardy drove upward in one strong shove and held , filling me with lustrous heat . He continued kissing me in the aftermath , his lips wandering sweetly while his fingertips coasted over my chin and cheeks and throat . After a while he pulled me out of bed and into the shower . Feeling drugged , I leaned on him as he washed me . His hands were gentle as he soaped and rinsed my body . Slippery , veiled in steam , I rested my cheek against the hard plane of his chest . He reached down and slipped two fingers inside me . I was sore and swollen , but it felt so good that I could n't help pushing my hips forward . I heard a low crooning sound in his throat , and his thumb swirled tenderly around my clit . With infinite skill , he eased me into another climax , while the hot water rained over me and his mouth ate at mine . I barely remembered drying off and going back to bed , only that I was soon drifting to sleep with his solid presence beside me . But some time later , I woke from a nightmare , my body alarmed by the awareness of a man sleeping nearby . I woke with a start , thinking for a moment that I was back with Nick , that I had n't escaped after all . There was movement beside me , a masculine weight , and I sucked in my breath sharply . "Haven
92481	92492	92121	92121	You	1769	" came a dark murmur . The sound calmed me . "
92496	92509	92121	92121	You	1769	" His voice was sleep softened and thick , like crushed velvet . "Uh
92513	92759	92121	92121	You	1769	"His palm stroked a circle on my chest to soothe my rocketing heartbeat . I sighed , and quieted in his arms . His lips moved down to my breasts , kissing the tender , hardened tips . I put my arms around his head , his hair soft against my inner wrists . He worked his way down slowly . My knees bent , and I felt his hands grip my ankles like warm , living manacles . Even in the darkness , I saw the broad span of his shoulders and the outline of his head , anchored between my thighs . He lapped at me languidly , feeding off my pleasure , sending me into long , helpless shudders . And when I fell asleep this time , there were no more dreams . CHAPTER SIXTEENI knew I looked like hell when I went into work the next morning , with dark circles under my eyes and whisker burns on my throat . I did n't care . I felt more at peace than I had in months . Years . Maybe ever . I could still feel the imprint of Hardy 's body on mine , not to mention a trace of soreness that reminded me of all we 'd done . And despite all the things I could and should have been worrying about , I decided to enjoy the simple human satisfaction of having been thoroughly made love to . "Call
92763	92771	92121	92121	You	1769	" Hardy had whispered in the morning . "

But at five - thirty that evening , the weekend would start . Before Hardy had left that morning , I made him a five - egg omelet with cheese and spinach , a rasher of bacon , and three pieces of toast . He 'd eaten every crumb . In response to my comment that he 'd cleaned out the contents of my refrigerator , Hardy had replied that satisfying me took a lot of work , and a man had to keep his strength up . Smiling , I went into my cubicle and opened my laptop . I reflected that I was in such a good mood , nothing could spoil it . Then Vanessa appeared . "

There was a reception for at least six hundred people , who entered a foyer with a large cylindrical tank , went to a shark - voyage ride , and browsed past exhibits designed to imitate a shipwreck , a sunken temple , a swamp , and a rain forest . The concerns I had over attending a reception with Hardy were gone within five minutes of arriving . He was relaxed and fun , chatting easily with people , taking me around . As Hardy introduced me to his business partners and their wives , and several other friends , I realized he was far from an outsider in this crowd . Although he had n't yet become part of the established circles like my family 's , he was part of a group who ran the smaller , more nimble companies that were finding new niches to fill . Hardy and I even knew some of the same people , a few of whom laughingly advised me that he would be a good catch for a woman who could manage to keep him in line . I realized that in his deceptively lazy way , Hardy was working the crowd as adeptly as anyone I had ever seen . He seemed to know everyone 's name , and he had the knack of focusing on the person he was talking to as if he or she were the most important person in the room . At the same time , Hardy was an attentive date , getting me a drink from the bar , keeping a light hand on my back , whispering things to make me laugh . As we stood in a group and talked , he idly straightened a kink on the gold chain of my evening bag as it dangled from my shoulder . I had wondered how Hardy would treat me when we were with other people , if he would want me to act as his satellite . That was what Nick had always demanded . But to my surprise , Hardy did n't seem to mind me having my own opinions . When the conversation turned to oil shale , for example . One of Hardy 's business partners , a geophysicist named Roy Newkirk , was talking enthusiastically about the possibilities of developing shale as an alternative to conventional oil . But I said I 'd read that it would be as bad for the environment as open - pit mining . And furthermore , the processing of shale would dump huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , which I thought was criminal . Unless one thought that global warming was n't coming along fast enough . Roy received my comments with a forced smile . "

I waited until I was certain Hardy had had enough time to reach his apartment , and then I called his main line . I got a voice message . Flopping back on the sofa , I stared at the ceiling with bleary impatience . Unable to stand it any longer , I called Hardy 's cell phone . Another recording . What was going on ? Was he all right?"Let
100862	100867	100708	100708	I	0	" I said aloud . "
100886	100920	100876	100876	He	124	"But I was n't listening to myself . I was too worried about Hardy . I paced around my apartment for another fifteen minutes , and then I called again . No answer . "Crap
100922	101332	100876	100876	He	124	" I muttered , scrubbing my eyes with half - closed fists . I was tense and tired and uneasy . No way was I going to get any sleep until I made sure Hardy was okay . Just a quick knock at his door . Maybe a hug . Maybe a cuddle in bed . I would n't ask him to talk . No pressure . I just wanted him to know I was there if he needed me . Sticking my feet into a pair of hard - soled slippers , I left my apartment and took the elevator to the eighteenth floor . It was cold in the elegantly sterile atmosphere of the hallway . Shivering , I went to the threshold and rang the bell . Stillness . Silence . And then a scrape of movement inside the apartment . I waited , waited , and realized incredulously that Hardy was n't going to answer . My face tightened in a scowl . Well , that was too damn bad . I would stand at his door and ring the bell all night if necessary . I pushed the button again . I had a sudden , terrible thought that maybe Hardy was n't alone . What other reason could there be for his refusal to see me ? But I could n't make myself believe — The door opened . I was confronted with a version of Hardy I had never seen before . It was mostly dark in his apartment , a faint illumination coming from the living room where the skyline bled an artificial glow through the row of long windows . Hardy was dressed in a white T - shirt and jeans , his feet bare . He looked big and shadowy and mean . And I got a strong , acid - sweet whiff of cheap tequila , the kind you went for when you wanted to get really hammered , really fast . I had seen Hardy drink before , but never to excess . He had told me he did n't like to feel out of control . What he had n't said , but I had understood , was that he could n't tolerate the idea of being vulnerable , physically or emotionally . My gaze traveled from his dark face to the empty shot glass in his hand . A crawly feeling went across my shoulders . "

102225	102233	102223	102223	Haven	131	" His voice was low and guttural . "
102264	102789	102793	102793	you	1926	"I did n't think Hardy was capable of hurting me , or any woman . But the truth was , I was n't completely sure . At that moment he seemed like nothing so much as a large , suffering animal , ready to tear apart anyone who came near him . And this was too damned soon after my divorce from Nick . I was gun - shy . I was still dealing with my own anger , my own fears . But there were certain moments in life when you had to step up to the plate or lose your chance forever . If Hardy was capable of hurting me , I would find out now . Every vein in my body was lit with the burn of adrenaline . I got dizzy with it . All right , you bastard , I thought with grimness and fury and love . Absolute scalding love , in that moment when he most needed it and least wanted it . Let 's see what you 've got . I walked into the darkness and closed the door . Hardy was on me the second after the lock clicked . I heard the thump of the shot glass as he dropped it . I was gripped , spun around , pushed against the door by two hundred pounds of hard - breathing male . He was shaking , his hands too tight , his lungs laboring . He kissed me with bruising force , lewd and whole - mouthed , going on for minutes until the tremors had eased and his erection was grinding against me . Every emotion , anger , grief , self - hatred , need , had found an outlet in pure hundred - proof lust . He pulled at my T - shirt and sent it flying to the side . As he ripped his own shirt off , I moved blindly toward the living room , not to get away from him but to find a more comfortable place than the entryway floor . I heard a possessive growl , and I was grabbed from behind . Hardy pushed me over the back of the sofa , bending me forward . He yanked the waistband of my sweatpants down . Gooseflesh rose all over , and I felt the weight of panic like a block of ice in my stomach . This was so much like what Nick had done . Another flashback was hovering , waiting to strike . But I gritted my teeth and braced my feet , and stiffened every muscle . As Hardy stood behind me , I felt the brush of burning skin , a heavy shaft against my backside . I wondered if he was too far gone to recall that I was afraid of doing it this way , that this was how I 'd been raped . Maybe he was doing it on purpose , to punish me , to make me hate him . One of his hands ran over my frozen spine , and I heard his breathing change . "Go
102795	102803	102793	102793	you	1926	" I said . My voice cracked . "
102810	102949	102793	102793	you	1926	" But Hardy did n't move except for the hand on my back . His palm glided up and down , and then around my waist to my stomach . He bent farther over me , his other hand cupping my breast . His mouth came to my shoulders , my spine , and he was groaning and kissing me while his fingers worked down below , opening me . I could only breathe in gasps , my body relaxing , yielding . I pictured his hand with those star - shaped scars on them . . . the last time we 'd been in bed I 'd made a project of kissing each tiny mark . And remembering , I went wet , responding helplessly to the touch , scent , warmth , that had become familiar . "Do
102952	103635	102793	102793	you	1926	" I said again , panting . He seemed not to hear , intent on fondling the soft pleated flesh beneath his fingers . His legs pressed between mine , widening my stance . The last traces of fear melted away . I pushed my hips back , quivering as I felt the stiff length of him . But he would n't give it to me , only massaged with agonizing gentleness until I clawed the velvet sofa , my breath coming in sobs . Darkness wrapped around us , cool and cradling , while he centered himself . I whimpered , my entire being focused on the place where he pressed me , inner muscles working in anticipation . He thrust forward , and I came from the thick - skewering pleasure , and he rooted deep while his hand stayed on my sex , stroking and stroking . He took me down to the floor , kneeling , pulling me against his chest . My head tipped back on his shoulder . I was raised and lifted , moaning in rhythm with the full slippery pitch of flesh into flesh until the delight broke and spread and flooded me with fresh heat . Hardy let me rest on his thighs , his arms locked around me . When my breathing had slowed , he carried me into the bedroom , His grip was tight . He was in a dominating mood . And it was primal and even a little threatening , but at the same time I was aroused beyond belief , which stunned me . 1 would have to figure out why . . . I needed to understand . . . but I could n't think with his hands on me . He knelt on the bed , reaching beneath my bottom to hoist my hips off the mattress . I was filled in a slow plunge , one of his hands going to the wet triangle between my thighs . The steady pumping and teasing , while he kept me lifted and supported , sent me hurtling into new sensation , cresting , easing , surging again . When my pleasure had finally spun out , Hardy pushed me flat , my arms and legs spread wide , and he spent inside me with violent pulses . I curved my arms around him , loving the feel of his shuddering body over mine . Gasping , he rolled us both to our sides . I heard my name carried on a taut breath . For a long time he held me to him . His hands compressed my body at slow intervals , molding me closer . Resting my head in the crook of his arm , I slept for a little while . It was still dark when I awoke . I felt from the tension in Hardy 's body that he was awake too . I rocked slowly against the insistent throb of his erection , my temperature rising . His mouth came to my neck and shoulder , kissing the soft skin , tasting . I pushed at his shoulders , and he went over easily , letting me straddle him . Gripping his sex , I positioned him and sank down . I heard the faint whistle of his breath through his teeth . He steadied my hips with his hands , letting me find a rhythm . He belonged to me absolutely . . . I knew it , I felt it in that moment of masculine surrender . I was riding him , giving it to him , and he groaned and arched his hips to meet every downward pump . His hands slid up my thighs to the center , caressing with his thumbs until I came , and that set him off too . He stiffened beneath me , the pleasure spiking . His hand closed behind the nape of my neck as he pulled me down to kiss him . A forceful kiss , flavored with desperation . "
103640	103656	102793	102793	you	1926	" I whispered afterward in the quiet room , feeling the need to comfort him . "
103661	104160	104161	104161	Coward	228	"Morning was nearly over by the time I awoke . The covers had been drawn up carefully around me , and my discarded clothes had been retrieved and draped neatly over the back of a chair . I called out sleepily for Hardy , wanting him to come back to bed . But as I was greeted with silence , I realized he 'd left me alone in his apartment . I rolled to my stomach , wincing a little as I felt an accumulation of tiny strains and pulls . An embarrassed grin spread across my face as I remembered the previous night . I might have thought it had been a long erotic dream , except that my body was letting me know it had definitely happened . I felt curiously light and buoyant , almost feverish with happiness . The night had been different from anything I had ever experienced before . Sex on a new level . . . deeper , more intense , opening me emotionally as well as physically . And it had affected Hardy the same way , which had probably scared the crap out of him . I realized Nick had always regarded sex as a kind of annexation . I had never been an individual to him , certainly not someone whose thoughts or feelings mattered . Which meant that when Nick had sex with me , it had really been nothing more than a form of masturbation . Whereas Hardy , even in his wildness , had made love to my mind and body , to me . And he had let me in past his defenses , however unwillingly . I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates , or love at first sight . But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life , if you were lucky , you might meet someone who was exactly right for you . Not because he was perfect , or because you were , but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together . Hardy would never be the easiest man to have a relationship with . He was complex and strong - willed and rough - edged . But I loved those qualities about him . I was more than willing to take him exactly as he was . And it did n't hurt that he seemed equally game to take me on my own terms . Yawning , I went to the bathroom , found Hardy 's robe , and tugged it on . The coffeemaker was all set up in the kitchen , with a mug and a clean spoon laid out . I pushed a button , and the air filled with the cheerful gurgle of brewing coffee . I picked up Hardy 's phone and dialed his cell number . No answer . I hung up the phone . "
104163	104169	104161	104161	Coward	228	" I said without heat . "
104184	104282	104283	104283	I	0	"But Hardy managed to avoid me all Saturday . And while I wanted badly to talk to him , pride would n't let me chase after him like a lovestruck skink , a Texas lizard which was known to lunge and circle around the male it was interested in . I figured I could afford to be patient with Hardy . So I left a couple of casual messages on his machine , and decided to wait him out . Meanwhile , I got an e - mail from Nick .

My hopes were deflated as I saw it was my dad . Sighing , I picked it up and answered morosely . "

So I decided to stay and hear Dad out , and put him in his place . The room was quiet except for the whirring of mechanical gears and rollers . I summoned a cool smile . "

111676	111762	111614	111614	Nick	92	"The paramedics arrived , followed soon by the police , while the building security guards kept anxious neighbors from coming in . I was n't aware of the exact moment Nick was taken out of the apartment by the police , I was too absorbed in Hardy . He drifted in and out of consciousness , his skin clammy , his breathing weak and fast . He seemed confused , asking me at least three times what had happened , and if I was okay . "Everything
111766	111792	111614	111614	Nick	92	" I murmured , stroking his tumbled hair , gripping his free hand firmly while a paramedic inserted a large bore needle for an IV . "
111796	111807	111614	111614	Nick	92	""Haven . . . had to tell you . . . "

They were fast and efficient . What EMS professionals call the "
111884	112114	111826	111826	Hush	238	" had started : the time between when a victim was shot and the time he arrived at a trauma center for treatment . If more than sixty minutes passed before he got treated , his chances of survival started to drop . I rode with Hardy in the ambulance while Jack drove to the hospital . It was only for Hardy 's sake that I managed to stay outwardly calm . Inside , I felt an anguish that seemed too great for a human heart to withstand . We arrived at the ambulance entrance , and the paramedics lifted Hardy on a gurney up to the building floor , which was slightly higher than the floor of the ambulance . Liberty and Gage were already at the trauma unit , having been alerted by Jack . I guessed the rest of my family would n't be far behind . I had n't given a thought to how I must have looked , all wild - eyed and bloodstained , but I gathered from their expressions that my appearance was a cause for concern . Liberty put her jacket over my shirt and cleaned my face with some baby wipes from her purse . When she discovered the lump behind my ear , she and Gage insisted that I get it looked at , despite my howls of protest . "I'm
112137	112138	112139	112139	Haven	131	" "
112141	112156	112139	112139	Haven	131	" Gage was in front of me , his steady gaze boring into mine . "
112214	112365	112203	112203	someone	263	"I was cleaned and bandaged , and sent back to the trauma unit waiting room . As Gage had predicted , there was no news . Hardy was in surgery , although no one would tell us what it was for , or how long it would last . I sat and stared blindly at the television in the corner of the room , wondering if I should call Hardy 's mother . I decided to wait until I found out something about his condition — hopefully something reassuring — that I could relay along with the news that he 'd been hurt . As I waited , guilt sucked me down like quicksand . I had never imagined Hardy would suffer for my past mistakes . If only I had never gotten involved with Nick . . . if only I had never started a relationship with Hardy . . ."Don't
112369	112379	112203	112203	someone	263	" I heard Liberty 's gentle voice beside me . "Don't

Liberty stood and motioned Dad over to us , and he eased into the chair beside me . And in spite of all my anger and feelings of betrayal , I leaned against him and put my head on his shoulder , breathing in his leathery Dad - smell . "What
112666	112779	112664	112664	Punkin	112	" he asked . I kept my head on his shoulder as I told him . Every now and then his hand came up and patted my arm gently . He seemed bewildered that Nick would have done something so crazy , and asked what had happened to drive him off the deep end . I thought of explaining that Nick had always been that way , that his abuse had destroyed our marriage . But I decided to save that particular conversation for a better time and place . So I just shook my head and shrugged and said I had no idea . And then Dad surprised me by saying , "
112791	112800	112801	112801	You	0	"I lifted my head and looked at him . "
112804	112863	112801	112801	You	0	How?""He called me around five today . Said he was sorry he 'd agreed to the lease deal , and he 'd already told T.J. it was off .

I 'd have expected the bullet to bounce around a little more , but thankfully it did n't . After we removed the bullet , we were able to do a relatively simple suture repair on the spleen and salvage it completely . Given Mr. Cates 's age and excellent health , there 's no reason to expect complications of any kind . So I 'd say he 'll be in the hospital for about a week , and then it 'll take about four to six weeks more until he 's all healed up . "My

113499	113516	113948	113948	Cates	124	" I 'm so relieved , I actually feel sort of queasy from it . Is that possible?""It
113521	113527	113948	113948	Cates	124	" Dr. Whitfield said kindly , "
113539	113947	113948	113948	Cates	124	"The hospital rule was that intensive care patients could have twenty - four - hour visitation . The catch was , you could only stay fifteen minutes per hour , except in special circumstances as approved by the nursing staff . I asked Gage to pull whatever strings he could to make sure I could come and go at will . My brother seemed vaguely amused by this , and reminded me about how I had once objected to using power and money to get special treatment . I told him that when you were in love , hypocrisy won out over principle . And Gage said he certainly understood that , and he went and got me special permission to stay with Hardy as long as I wanted . I dozed in a reclining chair in Hardy 's room most of the night . The problem was , a hospital was the worst place in the world to sleep . Nurses came in hourly , exchanging IV bags , checking the monitors , and taking Hardy 's temperature and blood pressure . But I welcomed each interruption , because I loved hearing about how well he was doing , over and over again . At daybreak Gage came to the hospital and told me he was going to drive me back to my apartment so I could shower and change . I did n't want to leave Hardy , but I knew I looked like something the cat dragged in , and it was probably a good idea for me to clean up some . Hardy had woken up when I came back at seven , and he was not pleased , to say the least , to find himself in a hospital bed and hooked up to monitors . I walked in to hear him arguing with a nurse , demanding that she take the IV out , and categorically refusing the pain medicine that he obviously needed . He did n't want to be poked and prodded , he said . He felt fine . All he needed was a bandage and an ice pack . I could tell the nurse was enjoying the argument with the big , blue - eyed male who was at her mercy , and I did n't blame her a bit . He looked lost , a little anxious , and utterly appetizing . And he was mine . "Hardy

114024	114063	113964	113964	I	0	" he told me . I went to the tray on the bed - table and picked up the Vicodin tablets the nurse had been trying to get him to take , along with a cup of water . "

114107	114158	114103	114103	she	2035	"The nurse left , no doubt wondering why such a hunk had n't been able to find a nicer girlfriend . When the door had closed , I fussed over Hardy a little , straightening the covers and readjusting his pillow . His gaze did n't stray from my face . "Haven

114237	114325	114211	114211	you	0	you?"Without hesitation , Hardy maneuvered himself over to the side , grunting in pain at the effort . I slipped off my clogs and climbed in carefully , resting in the crook of his arm . He sighed deeply , a sound of contentment . I nuzzled gently into his warm neck , breathing him in . Hardy smelled antiseptic , medicinal , like he 'd been sprayed with eau - de - hospital . But underneath the sterilized blankness I found the familiar fragrance of him . "Hardy
114327	114335	114211	114211	you	0	" I murmured , stroking his wrist , "

I hate the half of me that 's him , and I can feel it , that part that 's a bad , low , worthless son of a bitch , and when Churchill and T.J. came to me with that deal , I thought why the hell not .
