8835	8848	8863	8863	He	399	“ ‘ Forgive many things in others ; nothing in yourself . ’ ”
8849	8862	8863	8863	He	399	“ Are you going to sit here and quote Plato all afternoon ? ”
8868	8888	8951	8951	she	85	“ That was Ausonius , actually . And yes . My philosophy degree has to be of some use . ”
8938	8950	8951	8951	she	85	“ You can get down to your boxers , you know , ”
8955	8968	9001	9001	he	399	“ I ca n’t see you , and it feels much better . ”
8969	8976	8951	8951	she	85	“ I do n’t think so . ”
8977	8982	9001	9001	he	399	“ Briefs , then ? ”
8989	8998	9053	9053	His	399	“ You struck me as a boxer man . ”
9043	9052	9060	9060	She	85	“ Why are you asking about my clothing ? ”
9063	9078	9101	9101	she	85	“ It ’s called making conversation . You should learn how to do it . ”
9110	9116	9126	9126	Her	85	“ My name ’s Brontë . ”
9117	9125	9137	9137	people	182	“ Brontë ? After Charlotte or Emily ? ”
9151	9175	9238	9238	Brontë	85	“ Either . Both , I suppose . My mother had a fascination for classic literature , not that it got her anywhere . ”
9176	9188	9137	9137	people	182	“ I see we share a commonality in mothers , then . ”
9189	9201	9209	9209	he	399	“ Do we ? Was yours a total dreamer , too ? ”
9202	9208	9209	9209	he	399	“ Mine was a showgirl , ”
9213	9225	9137	9137	people	182	“ I am told she was highly impractical and extremely irresponsible . ”
9226	9231	9297	9297	She	85	“ Oh . Um . ”
9304	9343	9461	9461	he	409	“ I did n’t mean to sound negative about my mother . She just did n’t have sensible side . That ’s all . She was a good woman . Anyhow , she liked books — especially classics . ”
9344	9366	9374	9374	she	85	“ And you have inherited her love , I take it . You seem to have an obsession with ancient philosophers . ”
9367	9373	9374	9374	she	85	“ Everyone has a hobby , ”
9378	9383	9464	9464	his	409	“ What about you ? ”
9384	9389	9464	9464	his	409	“ I do not . ”
9390	9401	9374	9374	she	85	“ You do n’t have a hobby ? At all ? ”
9402	9433	9464	9464	his	409	“ I work . It takes up all my hours . Though I suppose I could spend my time memorizing pithy quotes to zing back at unsuspecting men in elevators . ”
9441	9453	9461	9461	he	409	“ I . . . wow . Sorry . I just — ”
9454	9460	9496	9496	his	409	“ I was teasing you , ”
9499	9502	9504	9504	she	85	“ Oh . ”
9508	9514	9524	9524	she	85	“ I did n’t realize . ”
9531	9539	9545	9545	he	409	“ So , what ’s your name ? ”
9554	9558	9545	9545	he	409	“ Logan Hawkings . ”
9559	9566	9578	9578	his	409	“ That ’s a nice name . ”
9567	9570	9578	9578	his	409	“ Indeed . ”
9584	9590	9601	9601	he	409	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
9591	9596	9621	9621	Brontë	85	“ Nothing at all . ”
9637	9649	9679	9679	She	85	“ So how long do you think we ’ll be here ? ”
9650	9678	9701	9701	He	409	“ I suppose it depends on how direct of a hit the hurricane makes on Seaturtle Cay . Then it depends on the organization of rescue efforts . ”
9690	9700	9701	9701	He	409	“ So far I ’m not impressed with them . ”
9704	9711	9730	9730	he	409	“ That makes two of us . ”
9740	9749	9701	9701	He	409	“ Do you have a family , Logan ? ”
9750	9753	9730	9730	he	409	“ No . ”
9772	9797	9730	9730	he	409	“ Me either . Since I ’m supposed to be on vacation , work wo n’t be missing me for a week at least . ”
9805	9820	9730	9730	he	409	“ God , I hope we ’re not stuck in here for a week . ”
9821	9828	9730	9730	he	409	“ I doubt that will happen . ”
9829	9834	9847	9847	She	85	“ Why is that ? ”
9835	9846	9847	9847	She	85	“ Because we ’ll die from dehydration long before that . ”
9861	9869	9730	9730	he	409	“ Do n’t say stuff like that . ”
9870	9883	9730	9730	he	409	“ All right then , we ’ll die thanks to the hurricane . ”
9884	9930	9944	9944	She	85	“ The glass is definitely half empty for you , is n’t it ? Do n’t think of things that way . Maybe one of the hotel employees stayed behind and will come looking for you . Did you assign anyone to check the floors ? ”
9931	9943	9944	9944	She	85	“ Assign anyone ? Why on earth would I do that ? ”
9950	9964	9730	9730	he	409	“ You ’re wearing a badge . Are n’t you the manager here ? ”
9965	9985	10050	10050	he	409	“ Ah . . . yes . And no , I did n’t assign anyone to check the floors . ”
10054	10067	10116	10116	He	409	“ Since you ’re the manager , can I make a suggestion ? ”
10068	10075	10050	10050	he	409	“ I ca n’t stop you . ”
10076	10080	10050	10050	he	409	“ Thicker walls . ”
10081	10084	10116	10116	He	409	“ Pardon ? ”
10085	10106	10116	10116	He	409	“ You definitely want thicker walls . You can hear everything through some of them . I ’m just saying . ”
10107	10115	10134	10134	She	85	“ I ’ll keep that in mind . ”
10138	10143	10159	10159	he	409	“ What was that ? ”
10152	10158	10159	10159	he	409	“ Hurricane must be arriving , ”
10162	10167	10159	10159	he	409	“ Oh , shit . ”
10176	10187	10193	10193	Brontë	85	“ We have to get out of here , Logan . ”
10188	10192	10393	10393	She	85	“ I know . ”
10384	10392	10451	10451	He	75	“ I think we can jump down . ”
10438	10443	10451	10451	He	75	“ Is it safe ? ”
10444	10450	10451	10451	He	75	“ Safer than staying here . ”
10456	10464	10475	10475	His	75	“ So how do we do this ? ”
10484	10506	10521	10521	him	75	“ If you can hold the doors , I ’ll slide through and then look for something to brace them apart . ”
10528	10535	10582	10582	He	75	“ What if I go first ? ”
10536	10581	10587	10587	Brontë	85	“ I ’m stronger . If I ca n’t find something to brace the doors , I ’ll have to hold them open for you while you climb down . I ’m not sure you ’ll be able to do the same for me . ”
10596	10604	10675	10675	He	75	“ Okay . I ’ll hold them . ”
10671	10674	10675	10675	He	75	“ Ready ? ”
10690	10702	10709	10709	she	85	“ Would it bother you if I went between your legs ? ”
10703	10708	10709	10709	she	85	“ Oh , no , ”
10712	10724	10749	10749	he	75	“ Be my guest . My legs welcome your invading presence . ”
10734	10748	10749	10749	he	75	“ I just do n’t want you losing your grip on the door , ”
10753	10766	10776	10776	she	85	“ That ’s all . I promise I wo n’t look up . ”
10767	10775	10901	10901	She	85	“ Just get us out of here , ”
10912	10917	10952	10952	she	85	“ Are you okay ? ”
10918	10947	10952	10952	she	85	“ I ’m fine . Just off balance . Stay there , and I ’ll look for something to brace the door open so you can crawl out . ”
10948	10951	11016	11016	she	85	“ Okay , ”
11012	11015	11149	11149	he	75	“ Hurry ! ”
11135	11148	11165	11165	She	85	“ You ’re going to have to slide down between my arms , ”
11153	11164	11165	11165	She	85	“ Get on your stomach and lower your legs first . ”
11168	11177	11183	11183	She	85	“ Gotcha . Can I let go now ? ”
11178	11182	11207	11207	she	85	“ Let go . ”
11221	11229	11193	11193	she	85	“ Maybe I should get dressed first — ”
11230	11235	11193	11193	she	85	“ Just come on ! ”
11236	11244	11277	11277	She	85	“ Well , then close your eyes ! ”
11245	11276	11380	11380	he	428	“ I ’m not going to close my eyes , Brontë . Just come on already . I ca n’t hold this forever . The hurricane ’s almost on us . ”
11375	11379	11446	11446	Logan	75	“ Just drop , ”
11441	11445	11452	11452	his	75	“ You okay ? ”
11465	11470	11490	11490	She	85	“ You ’re bleeding . ”
11471	11489	11498	11498	him	428	“ Just a scratch . Something broke the skin when I slid . I ’ll be fine . ”
11513	11519	11584	11584	He	75	“ What about the hurricane ? ”
11520	11528	11584	11584	He	75	“ Sounds like it ’s getting worse . ”
11529	11539	11560	11560	He	75	“ Should we go to the basement ? Something ? ”
11540	11559	11560	11560	He	75	“ Not the basement . The front lobby ’s already flooding with water . We need someplace safe . ”
11564	11575	11581	11581	she	85	“ Someplace with no windows that is off the ground . ”
11576	11580	11584	11584	He	75	“ A stairwell ? ”
11596	11608	11755	11755	Logan	75	“ Come on . I think the stairs are this way . ”
11748	11754	11755	11755	Logan	75	“ You can sightsee later , ”
11765	11769	11867	11867	Logan	75	“ Come on . ”
11862	11866	11876	11876	he	75	“ Stay there , ”
11881	11897	12039	12039	he	75	“ I ’ll be right back . I ’m just going to check something out . ”
12053	12057	12071	12071	She	85	“ You okay ? ”
12079	12133	12140	12140	Logan	75	“ I think the noise is messing with my head . Marcus Aurelius said that ‘ It is not death that a man should fear , but he should fear never beginning to live . ’ Except I do n’t think he ever went through a hurricane . I almost prefer the elevator . ”
12134	12139	12157	12157	He	75	“ I do n’t , ”
12143	12156	12199	12199	he	75	“ Wait here . I picked up a few things for us . ”
12209	12216	12265	12265	She	85	“ What ’s all this for ? ”
12217	12264	12295	12295	Logan	75	“ Just in case it gets cold later . We want to be prepared . It ’s going to be a long night with that storm raging . This is probably the only safe place in the building that we can get to at the moment . ”
12290	12294	12398	12398	she	85	“ Thank you . ”
12403	12411	12522	12522	he	75	“ Is one of those for me ? ”
12490	12520	12529	12529	Brontë	85	“ I had to raid the closest minibar . It ’s not a great selection , but it ’ll hold us until the worst of the storm passes overhead . ”
12536	12544	12550	12550	he	75	“ I could kiss you for that . ”
12545	12549	12616	12616	Logan	75	“ You could , ”
12612	12615	12629	12629	he	75	“ Shhh , ”
12649	12658	12746	12746	he	75	“ I ’m here . We ’re safe . ”
12750	12756	12757	12757	She	85	“ Eat your candy bar . ”
12764	12787	12848	12848	he	75	“ Just so you know , in the future , I prefer M&M ’s . The peanut kind , not the plain . ”
12788	12802	12809	12809	she	85	“ I ’ll keep that in mind . Philosophy and peanut M&M ’s . ”
12803	12808	12809	12809	she	85	“ That ’s right , ”
12832	12841	12886	12886	She	85	“ This is really good . Thank you . ”
12870	12885	12886	12886	She	85	“ So how is it that you know Marcus Aurelius by heart , Brontë ? ”
12889	12913	12886	12886	She	85	“ My mother loved books , but she especially loved the classics — Brontë , Austen , and Gaskell . The romantic ones . ”
12922	12963	12977	12977	Brontë	85	“ I graduated from UMKC with a BA in philosophy . Majored in that , minored in history . I like ancient philosophers . I feel like they taught a lot of wisdom that can be applied to modern life . ”
12964	12976	12977	12977	Brontë	85	“ Interesting . So you ’re . . . a teacher ? ”
12980	12993	13002	13002	He	450	“ Hardly . I ’m a waitress at a sock hop diner . ”
12994	13001	13002	13002	He	450	“ A . . . waitress . ”
13011	13021	13061	13061	She	85	“ That ’s a bit of a career change . ”
13022	13060	13061	13061	She	85	“ Not really . I started waitressing to pay the bills during school and then kept waitressing while I hunted for jobs after graduating , and , well , two years later , I ’m still waitressing . ”
13072	13080	13002	13002	He	450	“ So you ’re twenty - four ? ”
13081	13090	13100	13100	She	85	“ I am . How old are you ? ”
13091	13099	13100	13100	She	85	“ I just turned twenty - nine . ”
13105	13112	13130	13130	she	85	“ Wow , that ’s ancient . ”
13116	13129	13130	13130	she	85	“ Seriously , though , you ’re doing really good for yourself , ”
13134	13153	13169	13169	he	450	“ Manager of a big place like this at twenty - nine ? Your parents must be proud . ”
13175	13179	14124	14124	He	450	“ Thank you . ”
14149	14152	14124	14124	He	450	“ Brontë , ”
14161	14166	14124	14124	He	450	“ Move your hand . ”
14179	14182	14124	14124	He	450	“ Brontë , ”
14187	14202	14266	14266	She	85	“ You ’ve got a rather . . . personal grip at the moment . ”
14274	14280	14293	14293	he	450	“ Oh , my God . ”
14287	14292	14307	14307	He	450	“ My thoughts exactly , ”
14314	14320	14367	14367	Her	85	“ How are you doing ? ”
14382	14392	14420	14420	She	85	“ I ’m okay . Is it still raining ? ”
14393	14419	14420	14420	She	85	“ It sounds quieter . I think the worst of the storm has passed . We should probably get out and have a look around . ”
14426	14433	14367	14367	Her	85	“ Can we find a bathroom ? ”
14434	14442	14455	14455	He	450	“ They probably wo n’t be working . ”
14443	14454	14462	14462	his	450	“ Yeah , but a nonworking toilet beats a stairwell . ”
14465	14469	14625	14625	Logan	75	“ Come on . ”
14617	14623	14625	14625	Logan	75	“ Not a good sign , ”
14627	14655	14662	14662	she	85	“ Stick close to me . If the water ’s come in this far , we do n’t know what the rest of the building looks like . ”
14656	14661	14883	14883	She	85	“ Or the island , ”
14801	14810	14768	14768	his	75	“ You ’re not married , are you ? ”
14811	14814	14883	14883	She	85	“ Huh ? ”
14815	14834	14883	14883	She	85	“ Never mind . I just did n’t want to , you know , fondle a married man . ”
14835	14850	14768	14768	his	75	“ So it ’s all right to fondle a man when he ’s single ? ”
14851	14871	14883	14883	She	85	“ That ’s not what I meant , and you know it . I was just going to say — ”
14872	14878	14883	14883	She	85	“ I ’m not married . ”
14879	14882	14927	14929	a married man	2232	“ Oh . ”
14931	14935	14954	14954	her	85	“ Thank God . ”
14936	14946	14950	14950	She	85	“ I ’m also not looking for a relationship . ”
14963	14989	14950	14950	She	85	“ I was n’t asking because of that . This would just be . . . weird . . . if you had a wife . ”
14990	14999	14954	14954	her	85	“ We ’re not sleeping together , Brontë . ”
15000	15009	15056	15056	his	75	“ Well , technically , we just did . ”
15066	15072	15103	15103	His	75	“ Why all the questions ? ”
15073	15102	15142	15142	his	75	“ I was just curious . You know . If I ’d touched single junk or married junk . I think it ’s a reasonable thing to ask . ”
15145	15160	15198	15198	His	75	“ It only matters if you ’re planning on grabbing it again , Brontë . ”
15180	15197	15198	15198	His	75	“ Ah . Well . No , I was n’t making plans to do that again . ”
15206	15249	15565	15565	Logan	75	“ Well , now I ’m disappointed . Come on . I do n’t think it ’s safe to see if we can turn the power back on , so let ’s look for something that we can get some light with . ”
15547	15564	15577	15577	his	75	“ Wow . Your cleanup crew is going to be working some overtime , I think . ”
15580	15598	15599	15599	She	85	“ I was planning on renovating the place anyhow . Someone told me I needed thicker walls . ”
15610	15614	15621	15621	he	75	“ Good call . ”
15615	15620	15621	15621	he	75	“ I ’m starving , ”
15624	15662	15670	15670	She	85	“ We should head to the gift shop . We can probably find some supplies there . I ’m thinking water bottles , food , and maybe some dry clothes if it was n’t too badly hit . ”
15682	15698	15711	15711	she	85	“ Through the lobby and to the left , I think . Near the restaurant . ”
15715	15724	15730	15730	His	75	“ But of course , you know that . ”
15725	15729	15741	15741	he	75	“ Of course . ”
15747	15751	15973	15973	He	75	“ After you . ”
15950	15966	15973	15973	He	75	“ You do n’t think we ’re going to see any bodies , do you ? ”
15967	15972	15973	15973	He	75	“ I hope not . ”
15977	15988	15973	15973	He	75	“ If we ’re lucky , everyone else was evacuated . ”
15989	16007	16013	16013	he	75	“ Should we check the rest of the hotel ? Just in case anyone else was stranded ? ”
16008	16012	16013	16013	he	75	“ We will , ”
16026	16046	15973	15973	He	75	“ After we resupply ourselves . It wo n’t do us any good if you ’re fainting with hunger . ”
16047	16069	16077	16077	She	85	“ Me ? You make it sound like I ’m some weak flower on my last leg . What about you ? ”
16070	16076	16077	16077	She	85	“ I do n’t faint . ”
16080	16093	15973	15973	He	75	“ ‘ Nothing has more strength than dire necessity , ’ right ? ”
16094	16100	15973	15973	He	75	“ Another famous Plato gem ? ”
16101	16104	16077	16077	She	85	“ Euripides . ”
16105	16118	15973	15973	He	75	“ Of course . That was going to be my next guess . ”
16119	16130	16137	16137	She	85	“ Naturally . You ’re a big fan of Euripides ? ”
16131	16136	16216	16216	he	75	“ Who is n’t ? ”
16208	16215	16216	16216	he	75	“ The entire ceiling could collapse , ”
16220	16227	16236	16236	she	85	“ We have to be careful . ”
16228	16235	16339	16339	she	85	“ Now who ’s Suzy Sunshine ? ”
16333	16338	16339	16339	she	85	“ Just our luck , ”
16343	16350	16355	16355	he	75	“ Do you have the key ? ”
16351	16354	16355	16355	he	75	“ No , ”
16368	16372	16395	16395	He	75	“ Stay there . ”
16388	16394	16395	16395	He	75	“ What are you doing ? ”
16407	16415	16395	16395	He	75	“ Getting something better than a key . ”
16416	16422	16445	16445	he	75	“ What about the alarm ? ”
16423	16444	16461	16461	She	85	“ Either it ’s not working or we ’re going to need to hope that the gift shop has earplugs , ”
16456	16460	16657	16657	he	75	“ Stand back . ”
16664	16672	16701	16701	He	75	“ Alarm ’s dead . Come on . ”
16687	16700	16701	16701	He	75	“ What about all the glass ? We ’ll cut our feet . ”
16709	16717	16758	16758	he	75	“ You ’re right . Stay there . ”
16779	16783	16832	16832	She	85	“ Come on . ”
16847	16855	16894	16894	she	85	“ I think I ’m going to — ”
16889	16893	16922	16922	He	75	“ — fall , ”
16928	16932	16941	16941	She	85	“ You okay ? ”
16933	16940	16955	16955	Brontë	85	“ Just feel stupid is all . ”
16963	16973	17003	17003	He	75	“ Shoes ? We really should have brought ours . ”
16985	17002	17075	17075	Lovely	104	“ I see them . Stay there . Only one of us should risk cut feet . ”
17077	17088	17075	17075	Lovely	104	“ I found you some water shoes . What size ? ”
17089	17092	17108	17108	He	75	“ Seven . ”
17093	17107	17184	17184	She	85	“ This might be a seven . Hard to tell in the dark . ”
17188	17195	17228	17228	He	75	“ What supplies do we need ? ”
17196	17227	17295	17295	she	85	“ Flashlights , if we can find them . If not , something dry to use as a torch . Lighters . Food and water . Anything else you want . ”
17304	17311	17324	17324	She	85	“ I found some dry shirts . ”
17312	17323	17419	17419	he	75	“ Good , bring them . I found some lighters . ”
17427	17440	17634	17634	She	85	“ Now we can get a really good look at each other . ”
17647	17656	17634	17634	She	85	“ Hi there . Long time no see . ”
17668	17673	17676	17676	he	75	“ Hello , Brontë . ”
17688	17703	17716	17716	he	75	“ You could have looked at me before . It was n’t totally dark . ”
17704	17715	17716	17716	he	75	“ Yes , but now I get to see everything , ”
17731	17738	17785	17785	They	544	“ Not just shadows and suggestion . ”
17772	17784	17863	17863	He	75	“ I ’m just going to look for some more stuff . ”
17855	17862	17863	17863	He	75	“ I feel like a looter . ”
17872	17887	17863	17863	He	75	“ You are a looter . You are currently in the act of looting . ”
17888	17903	17920	17920	She	85	“ Gee , thanks . Are we going to get in trouble for this ? ”
17904	17919	17920	17920	She	85	“ Brontë , I ’m the manager . Just consider the tab on me . ”
17935	17953	17863	17863	He	75	“ How long do you think it ’ll take for them to get here and save us ? ”
17954	17969	18033	18033	He	546	“ I do n’t know . I ’ve never been in a hurricane before . ”
18019	18032	18033	18033	He	546	“ What if we ’re here for a week ? Or longer ? ”
18056	18067	18259	18259	Brontë	85	“ Then we get to know each other really well . ”
18254	18258	18277	18277	he	75	“ Pretty stuff , ”
18271	18276	18280	18280	She	85	“ You like that ? ”
18286	18307	18318	18318	Her	85	“ What woman would n’t ? It ’s really gorgeous , but it probably costs an arm and a leg . ”
18308	18317	18322	18322	She	85	“ Want me to loot it for you ? ”
18332	18336	18280	18280	She	85	“ Absolutely not . ”
18337	18340	18354	18354	He	75	“ Why ? ”
18341	18353	18354	18354	He	75	“ It ’s expensive , Logan . Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
18357	18387	18280	18280	She	85	“ The diamonds probably are n’t quality and I doubt that it ’s worth the markup , but if you want it , I ’ll get it for you . ”
18388	18397	18417	18417	He	75	“ No . We ’ll get in trouble . ”
18398	18416	18443	18443	him	75	“ Brontë , there ’s no one here . And I ’m the . . . manager . ”
18431	18440	18469	18469	He	75	“ I do n’t want it , Logan , ”
18448	18468	18469	18469	He	75	“ Looting it is wrong , and you ’d be crazy to risk being fired over something like that . ”
18472	18483	18781	18781	she	85	“ They ca n’t fire me , but suit yourself . ”
18806	18816	18775	18775	Logan	75	“ How long do you think this will last ? ”
18817	18828	18859	18859	She	85	“ Not long . We need to find something better . ”
18829	18858	18901	18901	He	75	“ We should check the rest of the resort , too . I ’d hate to think of someone else trapped in the elevators , waiting for rescue . ”
18910	18918	18929	18929	Logan	75	“ Should we check the upper floors ? ”
18919	18928	18929	18929	Logan	75	“ I ’m not sure it ’s wise , ”
18933	18974	18980	18980	she	85	“ You saw how badly the roof was destroyed in the lobby . We do n’t know that the other floors are n’t on the verge of collapse . We can take a look from outside tomorrow and decide then . ”
18975	18979	18980	18980	she	85	“ All right , ”
18990	19001	19012	19012	he	75	“ I guess we should crack open those chocolate bars ? ”
19002	19011	19012	19012	he	75	“ Or we could head to the kitchens , ”
19020	19039	19049	19049	She	85	“ See if there ’s anything worth saving now that the power ’s been off for a while . ”
19040	19048	19171	19171	Logan	75	“ Real food ? Sign me up . ”
19166	19170	19171	19171	Logan	75	“ Still cold , ”
19184	19199	19235	19235	she	85	“ Might be cold for a bit longer if we keep the door closed . ”
19226	19234	19235	19235	she	85	“ We should eat some of this , ”
19239	19250	19269	19269	They	578	“ Can we build a fire somewhere and cook some ? ”
19251	19268	19428	19428	She	85	“ If the stove does n’t work , yeah . Pick what you want to eat . ”
19439	19464	19476	19476	They	583	“ I think that was the best thing I ’ve ever eaten . I did n’t realize how hungry I was until just now . ”
19465	19475	19542	19542	she	85	“ We ’ve had our minds on other things . ”
19546	19562	19602	19602	His	75	“ I guess it ’d be bad manners to lick it , would n’t it ? ”
19563	19572	19584	19584	she	85	“ I ’m sure there are other cans . ”
19573	19583	19602	19602	His	75	“ Yes , but this one is right here , ”
19609	19621	20572	20572	she	85	“ You have some juice in the corner of your mouth . ”
20566	20571	20572	20572	she	85	“ You ’re frowning , ”
20576	20580	20594	20594	she	85	“ Everything okay ? ”
20581	20585	20594	20594	she	85	“ Just thinking . ”
20611	20619	20631	20631	he	75	“ Thinking that we need more chicken ? ”
20625	20630	20675	20675	She	85	“ Thinking about rescue , ”
20664	20674	20675	20675	She	85	“ It might be days before anyone finds us . ”
20696	20713	20747	20747	he	75	“ I ’m thinking we ’ll just be really close friends by the end of this . ”
20733	20746	20766	20766	Brontë	85	“ We do n’t know enough about each other to be friends , ”
20783	20796	20802	20802	She	85	“ I guess we could learn , then , could n’t we ? ”
20797	20801	20804	20804	her	85	“ We could . ”
20810	20822	20837	20837	he	75	“ So how long have you lived here on the island ? ”
20832	20836	20837	20837	he	75	“ A year , ”
20842	20860	20804	20804	her	85	“ What made you decide to take a job here ? Did you live on the island ? ”
20861	20875	20837	20837	he	75	“ No . A friend . . . referred me to the owner . ”
20883	20893	20837	20837	he	75	“ I came here when I got the job . ”
20894	20901	20837	20837	he	75	“ Where did you move from ? ”
20902	20907	20950	20950	She	85	“ New York City . ”
20959	20965	21038	21038	She	85	“ Where are you from ? ”
20966	20979	21038	21038	She	85	“ The Midwest . Kansas City . Have you ever been there ? ”
20980	20988	20950	20950	She	85	“ Once or twice . For business . ”
20989	21009	21038	21038	She	85	“ You ’ve got one up on me , then . I ’ve never been to New York City . ”
21010	21022	21038	21038	She	85	“ You should go sometime . I ’ll show you around . ”
21042	21061	21068	21068	He	75	“ I ’d like that . Have you been to many shows ? Visited the Statue of Liberty ? ”
21062	21067	21107	21107	she	85	“ No and no . ”
21100	21106	21107	21107	she	85	“ That ’s a shame , ”
21119	21146	21107	21107	she	85	“ If I went to New York , I ’d want to visit it . Go get my picture taken and do all the touristy things . ”
21147	21155	21184	21184	she	85	“ You and a million other tourists . ”
21156	21183	21184	21184	she	85	“ True . I guess it ’s different when you ’re there . In Kansas City , those tourists just end up here at Seaturtle Cay , ”
21187	21194	21107	21107	she	85	“ Courtesy of 99.9 Pop Fever . ”
21195	21199	21107	21107	she	85	“ Pop Fever ? ”
21200	21232	21275	21275	She	85	“ Radio station . I won a trip . It ’s a little out of my price range to go anywhere normally . Too busy making ends meet and all that . ”
21267	21274	21282	21282	she	85	“ Out of your price range ? ”
21288	21306	21321	21321	She	85	“ Remember that I ’m a waitress . Pretty much everything is out of my price range . ”
21307	21320	21321	21321	She	85	“ You ’re smart . You can do something other than waitressing . ”
21324	21381	21395	21395	he	624	“ Actually , I like the waitressing . I like working with people . But the pay stinks . It covers the bills , but just barely . That ’s why I ’d been really hoping to enjoy this trip . It ’s the first vacation I ’ve had in two years , since I graduated . ”
21382	21394	21395	21395	he	624	“ I do n’t get away for vacation much , either , ”
21406	21425	21431	21431	She	85	“ Is n’t every day here like a vacation , though ? Sun and sand and palm trees — ”
21426	21430	21431	21431	She	85	“ And hurricanes . ”
21435	21444	21484	21484	he	624	“ True . Is this your first one ? ”
21472	21483	21500	21500	She	85	“ Every one of them feels like the first one , ”
21491	21499	21500	21500	She	85	“ I suppose that ’s true enough . ”
21503	21524	21530	21530	She	85	“ I still ca n’t believe Sharon left without me . I should n’t be surprised , but I am . ”
21525	21529	21530	21530	She	85	“ Your roommate ? ”
21533	21583	21584	21584	Brontë	85	“ She sent me up to her room to go look for her passport that she ’d lost . That was how I got stuck in the elevator . I never found it , so I assume she still had it and was able to get off the island . ”
21593	21608	21619	21619	he	626	“ If it was n’t for her , I would n’t be stuck here . ”
21609	21618	21619	21619	he	626	“ Then I ’ll have to thank her , ”
21629	21648	21660	21660	she	627	“ If I had to be stranded in a hurricane , I ’m glad it ’s with you . ”
21672	21685	21695	21696	Most people	628	“ I . . . thank you . That ’s very sweet . ”
21686	21694	21745	21745	Brontë	85	“ I ’m not a sweet man . ”
21736	21744	21745	21745	Brontë	85	“ Oh , I do n’t know , ”
21752	21760	21782	21782	She	82	“ You ’ve been nice to me . ”
21761	21781	21782	21782	She	82	“ That ’s because I like you . Most are n’t so lucky . I barely tolerate almost everyone . ”
21793	21802	21803	21803	She	82	“ Then I ’m glad you like me . ”
21815	21829	21860	21860	She	82	“ You ’re just saying that because you ’re stuck here with me . ”
21830	21859	21884	21884	she	82	“ No , I ’m saying it because you ’re smart , and funny , and beautiful . Being stranded with you has nothing to do with it . ”
21875	21883	21884	21884	she	82	“ I imagine work keeps you busy , ”
21890	21896	21906	21906	She	82	“ This place is enormous . ”
21923	21933	21938	21938	he	626	“ Do you have a big family , Logan ? ”
21934	21937	21945	21945	He	626	“ No , ”
21956	21961	21968	21968	She	82	“ Are you tired ? ”
21962	21967	21968	21968	She	82	“ Drained , really . ”
21976	22005	22019	22019	he	626	“ Okay , maybe a bit tired . Not looking forward to getting back to that stairwell , though . It ’s not exactly the height of comfort . ”
22006	22018	22064	22064	He	626	“ I have some ideas of how we can fix that , ”
22054	22063	22085	22085	She	82	“ Should n’t we do something about that ? ”
22079	22084	22589	22589	He	626	“ Taken care of . ”
22594	22598	22599	22599	She	85	“ Wake up . ”
22614	22619	22625	22625	he	626	“ Huh ? What ? ”
22620	22624	22625	22625	he	626	“ Calm down , ”
22629	22634	22635	22635	Brontë	85	“ Nothing ’s wrong . ”
22645	22651	22666	22666	She	85	“ What time is it ? ”
22652	22665	22666	22666	She	85	“ My phone ’s dead . Water must have gotten into it . ”
22697	22715	22731	22731	They	646	“ Damn it . There goes my battery . It said it ’s eleven a.m. , though . ”
22716	22730	22883	22883	Brontë	85	“ We should head down to the kitchens and grab lunch , then . ”
22867	22882	22935	22935	He	75	“ This is the first day it has n’t rained since I got here , ”
22926	22934	22967	22967	Her	85	“ Should we check out the beach ? ”
22961	22966	22967	22967	Her	85	“ If you like . ”
22971	22985	22999	22999	he	75	“ I would . Do you think the beach is trashed , too ? ”
22986	22997	23156	23156	She	85	“ We ’ll soon find out , wo n’t we ? ”
23141	23155	23281	23281	he	75	“ It really did a number on this place , did n’t it ? ”
23276	23280	23281	23281	he	75	“ Come on , ”
23285	23295	23379	23379	her	85	“ Let ’s see what the beach looks like . ”
23387	23392	23431	23431	Brontë	85	“ It ’s gorgeous . ”
23435	23440	23480	23480	He	75	“ What is it ? ”
23441	23479	23480	23480	He	75	“ I was just thinking that it figures that we have nice beach weather after my vacation has already been ruined . I would have loved to spend a few days just enjoying the sun and sand . ”
23489	23495	23496	23496	Her	85	“ What ’s stopping you ? ”
23505	23522	23561	23561	She	85	“ Should n’t we be working on making shelter or some other survival sorts of things ? ”
23523	23560	23631	23631	Her	85	“ We have food . We have shelter . All we need to do is wait to be rescued . If it ’ll make you feel better , we can make an SOS on the sand . ”
23638	23647	23652	23652	Brontë	85	“ Should we go back and get swimsuits ? ”
23648	23651	23652	23652	Brontë	85	“ Why ? ”
23657	23661	23678	23678	He	75	“ To swim ? ”
23697	23708	23711	23711	her	85	“ There ’s no one here but me , Brontë . ”
23720	23725	23726	23726	She	85	“ You ’re right . ”
23746	23755	24634	24634	she	85	“ Last one in ’s a rotten egg . ”
24618	24633	24869	24869	he	75	“ Well , you ’re definitely not a man who can resist a challenge , ”
24861	24868	24869	24869	he	75	“ For what it ’s worth , ”
24878	24892	24897	24897	she	85	“ My suggestion was going to be that we swim in our underwear . ”
24893	24896	24923	24923	His	75	“ Oh , ”
24916	24922	25383	25383	his	75	“ I was n’t sure — ”
25398	25405	25413	25413	She	85	“ Was that what you wanted ? ”
25423	25437	25467	25467	his	75	“ I was n’t sure what I wanted until just now , actually . ”
25438	25442	25459	25459	she	85	“ And now ? ”
25443	25458	25545	25545	Logan	75	“ Now I think I ’m rather glad we ’re alone on the beach , ”
25555	25560	25574	25574	she	85	“ More nervous laughter ? ”
25561	25573	25878	25878	Brontë	85	“ No , this time I ’m totally laughing at you , ”
25871	25877	25905	25905	he	75	“ I suppose we should , ”
25916	25939	25940	25940	She	85	“ There ’s enough driftwood on the beach that we could build a fire and hang out here a few hours more . ”
25943	25951	25962	25962	Logan	75	“ That sounds like a lovely idea . ”
25969	25996	25997	25997	Brontë	85	“ How about I work on the SOS and building a fire , and you go and get dry clothes and something to eat and drink ? ”
26004	26018	26025	26025	he	75	“ Now that sounds like a plan . I ’ll be right back . ”
26019	26024	26303	26303	She	85	“ Take the flashlight , ”
26297	26302	26382	26382	he	75	“ You look great . ”
26361	26368	26382	26382	he	75	“ I did n’t do anything . ”
26369	26379	26397	26397	She	85	“ I know . But you still look great . ”
26388	26396	26397	26397	She	85	“ I ’m glad you ’re back . ”
26403	26413	26382	26382	he	75	“ I brought drinks , food , and dessert . ”
26414	26421	26428	26428	she	85	“ I ’m a lucky man . ”
26422	26427	26450	26450	They	728	“ And a flirt , ”
26439	26449	26524	26524	He	75	“ But I think that ’s a forgivable offense . ”
26540	26543	26578	26578	She	85	“ Thirsty ? ”
26590	26594	26650	26650	he	75	“ Just thinking . ”
26595	26599	26611	26611	She	85	“ Thinking about ? ”
26600	26610	26611	26611	She	85	“ How there ’s no one around for miles . ”
26630	26641	26685	26685	Logan	75	“ And how that can sometimes be a little frightening . ”
26688	26702	26709	26709	she	85	“ Do n’t be frightened . I ’m right here next to you . ”
26703	26708	26709	26709	she	85	“ I ’m glad , ”
26714	26729	26741	26741	She	85	“ I do n’t know what I ’d do if you were n’t here . ”
26730	26740	26762	26762	she	85	“ You ’d probably still be in the elevator . ”
26767	26777	26821	26821	She	85	“ I ’m glad you ’re here with me . ”
26831	26854	26855	26855	He	75	“ Do you want s’mores ? You know , chocolate and graham crackers and marshmallows ? They ’re the perfect camping treat . ”
26868	26882	26891	26891	she	85	“ I suppose this is a lot like camping , is n’t it ? ”
26883	26890	26891	26891	she	85	“ Right down to the campfire , ”
26897	26907	27002	27002	Brontë	85	“ Do you have a stick for my marshmallow ? ”
26989	27001	27005	27005	He	75	“ So you ’re one of those men , are you ? ”
27011	27017	27018	27018	She	85	“ One of what men ? ”
27027	27044	27050	27050	he	75	“ You ’re willing to eat a little charcoal as long as it gets done faster . ”
27045	27049	27050	27050	he	75	“ Collateral damage , ”
27054	27067	27073	27073	she	85	“ One expects that sort of thing when making a bold decision . ”
27068	27072	27073	27073	she	85	“ Very bold , ”
27079	27100	27259	27259	he	75	“ Could you blow out one of those bold decisions and put it on my cracker so I can eat ? ”
27252	27258	27259	27259	he	75	“ Speaking of bold decisions , ”
27275	27280	27285	27285	she	85	“ Have you decided ? ”
27281	27284	27285	27285	she	85	“ Decided ? ”
27295	27348	27381	27381	he	735	“ You and I keep dancing around our attraction without ever really coming out and saying exactly what we ’re thinking . I ’m not like that , Brontë . I ’m the kind of guy that wants to let you know exactly how I feel , but you keep running away . ”
27349	27355	27381	27381	he	735	“ I ’m not running , ”
27362	27366	27376	27376	His	735	“ Tell me . ”
27367	27375	27466	27466	Logan	75	“ I ’ll show you , then . ”
27470	27478	27805	27805	she	85	“ It ’s your move , Brontë . ”
27799	27804	27805	27805	she	85	“ I want this , ”
27812	27826	27839	27839	he	75	“ but I do n’t know how good I am at casual relationships . ”
27827	27838	27970	27970	He	75	“ We can worry about that once we ’re rescued , ”
27985	27992	28001	28001	she	85	“ Should I not have asked ? ”
27993	28000	28001	28001	she	85	“ No , asking is good , ”
28011	28024	28031	28031	She	85	“ I ’m just not exactly at my hottest at the moment . ”
28025	28030	28031	28031	She	85	“ Quote me something . ”
28051	28061	28066	28066	He	75	“ ‘ Happiness depends upon ourselves . ’ Aristotle . ”
28062	28065	28066	28066	He	75	“ See ? ”
28077	28087	28088	28088	She	85	“ Hearing you say that is so incredibly hot . ”
28092	28099	28107	28107	he	75	“ You ’re a strange man . ”
28100	28106	28107	28107	he	75	“ And you ’re beautiful , ”
28111	28127	28138	28138	She	85	“ I have n’t been able to take my eyes off of you all day . ”
28151	28156	28164	28164	He	75	“ Then kiss me ? ”
28157	28163	28175	28175	she	85	“ You have to ask ? ”
28169	28174	28382	28382	he	75	“ Asking ’s good , ”
28378	28381	28402	28402	he	75	“ Careful , ”
28406	28415	28420	28420	she	85	“ It seems my kiss is rather dangerous . ”
28416	28419	28452	28452	Brontë	85	“ Extremely , ”
28460	28475	28490	28490	he	75	“ In fact , I might need to lie down to get my bearings . ”
28507	28510	28681	28681	his	75	“ Better ? ”
28593	28599	28614	28614	she	85	“ Should we go inside ? ”
28600	28606	28614	28614	she	85	“ Do you want to ? ”
28607	28613	28636	28636	her	85	“ I do n’t know , ”
28651	28664	28681	28681	his	75	“ I want to stay out here but it feels . . . ”
28665	28668	28681	28681	his	75	“ Wrong ? ”
28669	28677	28681	28681	his	75	“ I was going to say naughty . ”
28690	28696	28697	28697	She	85	“ And naughty is bad ? ”
28721	28742	28758	28758	She	85	“ Actually , no . Now that I think about it , I rather like naughty . What about you ? ”
28743	28757	28831	28831	He	75	“ I do n’t have condoms out here . Unless you brought them . ”
28813	28822	28831	28831	He	75	“ No , I did n’t bring any . ”
28823	28830	28831	28831	He	75	“ Then I can pull out . ”
28846	28854	28855	28855	His	75	“ If you ’re okay with that . ”
28870	28885	28892	28892	he	75	“ I ’m good with that . I ’m clean , by the way . ”
28886	28891	28892	28892	he	75	“ So am I , ”
28895	28906	28947	28947	He	75	“ Are you sure you would n’t rather go inside ? ”
28907	28916	28924	28924	She	85	“ No , I like it out here . ”
28917	28923	28924	28924	She	85	“ Where it ’s naughty ? ”
28927	28930	29097	29097	Brontë	85	“ Precisely . ”
29092	29096	29097	29097	Brontë	85	“ Touch me , ”
29102	29105	29204	29204	Logan	75	“ Please . ”
29211	29224	29233	29233	she	85	“ Maybe I want to keep kissing you for a bit longer . ”
29225	29232	29426	29426	he	75	“ That ’s okay , too , ”
29421	29425	29540	29540	he	75	“ Like that ? ”
29535	29539	29550	29550	she	85	“ Like that ? ”
29544	29549	29603	29603	him	75	“ Just like that , ”
29612	29619	29791	29791	him	75	“ Let ’s take this off . ”
29807	29824	29837	29837	he	75	“ Your breasts are beautiful . I ’ve been wanting to play with them all afternoon . ”
29845	29858	29933	29933	Her	85	“ Watching them naked and glistening with water was driving me mad . ”
29938	29941	29952	29952	he	75	“ Logan . ”
29942	29951	29952	29952	he	75	“ Love it when you say my name , ”
29962	29967	29968	29968	she	85	“ Oh , Logan , ”

30110	30125	30130	30130	she	85	“ I want you to say my name again while I ’m touching you . ”
30126	30129	30220	30220	she	85	“ Logan , ”
30233	30240	30245	30245	He	75	“ I — I’m going to — ”

30351	30357	30358	30358	He	75	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
30369	30373	30381	30381	she	85	“ About what ? ”
30374	30380	30381	30381	she	85	“ Y - your shoulder , ”
30386	30392	30403	30403	he	75	“ I ’m hurting you . ”
30393	30402	30498	30498	He	75	“ You ’re not hurting me , Brontë , ”

30599	30608	30628	30628	He	75	“ And I know you were n’t faking . ”
30619	30627	30656	30656	He	75	“ Exactly how do you know that ? ”
30650	30655	30687	30687	he	75	“ Because of that . ”
30682	30686	30687	30687	he	75	“ And that , ”
30690	30724	30770	30770	He	75	“ If I had a finger sunk deep inside you when you came , you ’d clenched all around me , would n’t you ? Milk my finger like you would my cock . ”
30741	30769	30803	30803	she	85	“ You ’re sweet , and you ’re smart , and sexy , and so very real , Brontë . That ’s what I like about you . ”

30957	30972	31048	31048	she	85	“ Just been a while , that ’s all . Give me a moment . ”
31038	31047	31431	31431	Logan	75	“ Oh . . . do that again , ”
31423	31430	31456	31456	he	75	“ Wh - what was that ? ”

31800	31830	31831	31831	He	75	“ For showing me where the G - spot was . I had no idea . I think I ’m ruined for non - G - spot sex now . ”
31840	31850	31878	31878	She	85	“ I would n’t be so sure about that . ”
31851	31877	31878	31878	She	85	“ Well , okay , it ’d have to be really great sex to make up for the lack of the G - spot attention . ”
31894	31907	31878	31878	She	85	“ I think I ’m going to go take a quick dunk . ”
31908	31914	31930	31930	she	85	“ It ’s probably cold . ”
31915	31929	31930	31930	she	85	“ ‘ You will never do anything in this world without courage , ’ ”
31935	31941	31963	31963	he	75	“ Is that a challenge ? ”
31974	31987	31994	31994	she	85	“ Are you saying I ’m not brave enough for cold water ? ”
31988	31993	32070	32070	Logan	75	“ Not at all , ”
32063	32069	32448	32448	She	85	“ There ’s your courage , ”

33328	33335	33340	33340	Her	85	“ That ’s a good way , ”
33347	33365	33370	33370	She	85	“ It ’s a shame you woke up before I had to resort to more insistent tactics . ”
33366	33369	33379	33379	her	85	“ Oh ? ”
33394	33402	33426	33426	He	75	“ What did you have in mind ? ”
33403	33418	33426	33426	He	75	“ Burying my face between your legs and licking your pussy until you came . ”
33436	33442	33456	33456	she	85	“ What are you thinking ? ”
33443	33455	33456	33456	she	85	“ I ’m thinking I should have slept a bit longer , ”
33465	33473	33474	33474	Logan	75	“ I miss all the good stuff . ”
33486	33492	33497	33497	He	75	“ I can be persuaded . ”
33493	33496	33528	33528	his	75	“ Oh ? ”
33537	33545	33554	33554	She	85	“ You could . . . ask . ”
33546	33553	33562	33562	her	85	“ Is that all it takes ? ”
33570	33583	33661	33661	she	85	“ Please , Logan . I ’ll be so good to you . ”
33649	33660	33696	33696	She	85	“ You do n’t waste any time , do you ? ”
33690	33695	33722	33722	he	75	“ You taste amazing . ”
33740	33743	33744	33744	Her	85	“ Oh . ”
33755	33767	33806	33806	He	75	“ Logan , I do n’t know . I . . . ”
33797	33805	33806	33806	He	75	“ Do you want me to stop ? ”
33815	33820	33856	33856	she	85	“ Are you uncomfortable ? ”

35532	35540	35561	35561	He	75	“ I hope it ’s not chocolate . ”

37484	37512	37519	37519	Logan	75	“ You looked entirely too happy for a man who ’s been stranded for a few days , but I guess the company was good , right ? ”
37513	37518	37519	37519	Logan	75	“ This is Brontë , ”

37684	37706	37846	37848	the new guy	884	“ I guess I picked the right hotel to be stranded at if it ’s the one with the private helicopter . ”
37832	37845	37851	37851	Logan	75	“ Does this dump of a resort have a helicopter , Logan ? ”
37860	37865	37870	37871	The newcomer	868	“ It does not . ”

37921	37945	37952	37952	Logan	75	“ Hell , no . And if anybody asked , this is a Red Cross helicopter . Or Coast Guard . Or something . ”
37946	37951	37974	37974	he	75	“ It ’s not ? ”
37960	37970	38000	38000	She	84	“ We ’ll talk about this later , Brontë . ”
37993	37999	38000	38000	She	84	“ What ’s going on ? ”

38014	38020	38021	38021	he	75	“ Just an old friend , ”
38030	38045	38116	38116	She	84	“ And somehow I ’m thinking Logan ’s in trouble , is n’t he ? ”
38123	38136	38143	38143	His	75	“ You ’re not the manager of this place , are you ? ”
38137	38142	38143	38143	His	75	“ I ’m not . ”
38150	38156	38177	38177	He	75	“ Then who are you ? ”
38168	38176	38531	38531	he	75	“ He ’s the owner , baby . ”

38737	38757	38901	38901	Jonathan	79	“ One of my summer homes in Miami . You can stay here until we get things sorted out . ”
38917	38950	38961	38961	she	85	“ You can stay here , Brontë . I only have a few guest rooms in this house , so if you do n’t like it , we can switch your room . ”
38951	38960	39002	39002	Logan	75	“ I ’m sure it ’ll be fine , ”
38995	39001	39002	39002	Logan	75	“ She stays with me , ”
39017	39024	39037	39037	his	79	“ I want my own room . ”

39048	39053	39075	39075	He	79	“ Is that so ? ”
39061	39074	39075	39075	He	79	“ In that case , I guess you can stay with Logan . ”
39081	39088	39103	39103	She	85	“ It ’s your usual room . ”
39108	39126	39170	39170	He	79	“ Care to show me which room that is ? I think I ’d like a shower . ”
39138	39169	39213	39213	her	85	“ I ’ll let lover boy here do the honors . I need to make a few calls . Feel free to head downstairs when you ’re up to it . ”
39219	39228	39245	39245	he	79	“ You have some serious explaining to do . ”
39229	39244	39276	39276	he	79	“ I know , and we ’ll talk about it later . I promise , ”
39287	39293	39357	39357	Logan	75	“ This is our room . ”

39425	39453	39454	39454	She	85	“ I need to meet with Jonathan to discuss a few things and then call my assistant . I ’ve been out of pocket for too long . ”
39466	39475	39421	39421	Logan	75	“ I thought we were going to talk . ”
39476	39481	39454	39454	She	85	“ It can wait . ”
39482	39494	39506	39506	She	85	“ No , it ca n’t . You lied to me . ”
39495	39505	39506	39506	She	85	“ The lie ended up being to your benefit . ”
39509	39523	39530	39530	he	75	“ My benefit ? Since when is lying to someone to their benefit ? ”
39524	39529	39530	39530	he	75	“ I ’m wealthy , ”
39533	39564	39995	39998	a local taxi service	950	“ I ’m sure that ’ll make up for a lot of things . Take a shower , and you ’ll feel better . I need to talk to Jonathan . ”
40000	40014	40043	40051	The woman on the other end of the line	951	“ I need a car to take me to the airport , please . ”
40015	40025	40043	40051	The woman on the other end of the line	951	“ No problem . What ’s your current address ? ”
40026	40042	40081	40081	Brontë	85	“ I have no idea . Can you do a reverse lookup on the number ? ”
40061	40080	40351	40351	He	79	“ I ’ve got the address . Someone will be there to pick you up in fifteen minutes . ”
40337	40350	40375	40375	Jonathan	79	“ Need a drink ? You look like you could use one . ”
40357	40374	40377	40377	his	79	“ The only drink I could use right now is water . Alcohol just dehydrates you . ”
40380	40411	40480	40480	Jonathan	79	“ You never loosen up , do you ? It ’s a wonder that your little gal pal did n’t run away screaming as soon as you opened your mouth . ”
40471	40479	40480	40480	Jonathan	79	“ We got stuck in an elevator . ”
40488	40517	40533	40533	Logan	75	“ Is that how you got left behind ? I was wondering if that shit manager of the place had neglected to tell anyone that you were there . ”
40518	40529	40540	40541	no one	181	“ I fired him a few hours before the evacuation . ”
40548	40559	40610	40610	Jonathan	79	“ How ’d you figure out I was still there ? ”
40560	40609	40610	40610	Jonathan	79	“ Oh , Hunter ’s assistant ’s been trying to get a hold of you for something , and when he could n’t contact you for a couple of days , he set Hunter on it . Hunter did n’t have a chopper , so he called me . ”
40613	40625	40648	40648	Jonathan	79	“ Was n’t hard to figure out where you were at . ”
40640	40647	40648	40648	Jonathan	79	“ Thank you for the rescue . ”
40651	40671	40719	40719	Logan	75	“ I figured I ’d come after you . It might have taken anyone else a few more days . ”
40728	40743	40766	40766	her	85	“ So . . . the girl . You said her name was Brontë ? ”
40772	40785	40801	40801	Jonathan	79	“ Cute girl . She ’s with you , I take it ? ”
40797	40800	40801	40801	Jonathan	79	“ Why ? ”
40806	40825	40834	40834	Danica	82	“ Down , boy . I was just going to comment that she was n’t your regular type . ”
40837	40848	40834	40834	Danica	82	“ What exactly do you know about my regular type ? ”
40849	40886	40834	40834	Danica	82	“ They ’re friendlier , for one . That girl looked like she was ready to chew you up and spit you out once she found out you owned the place . You lied to her ? ”
40887	40912	40926	40926	Jonathan	79	“ She saw my suit and assumed I was the manager . I decided not to disabuse her of that assumption . Seemed easier . ”
40913	40925	40926	40926	Jonathan	79	“ Well , I guess she ’s not a gold digger , ”
40929	40938	40834	40834	Danica	82	“ She did look pretty pissed , though . ”
40939	40953	40973	40973	Logan	75	“ She ’ll get over it . The lie was to her benefit . ”
40954	40972	41039	41039	he	194	“ Shit , man , that ’s cold . I hope you did n’t tell her that . ”
41044	41067	41119	41119	Brontë	85	“ She ’s not like other women . She ’ll realize that I was protecting my identity and be fine with it . ”
41121	41145	41150	41150	Jonathan	79	“ If you say so . You know her better than I do . What did you say she did for a living ? ”
41146	41149	41150	41150	Jonathan	79	“ Nothing . ”
41162	41170	41192	41192	He	194	“ What do you mean , nothing ? ”
41171	41191	41192	41192	He	194	“ I mean she does nothing for a living . She ’s a waitress at a sock hop diner . ”
41205	41216	41252	41252	Logan	75	“ She worked there during college and never really left . ”
41217	41251	41491	41491	his	194	“ Ah . I ’m starting to see why you kept your identity a secret . Afraid she ’s going to look to you to keep her in the lifestyle that she needs ? ”
41494	41510	41533	41534	His friend	927	“ She ’s not like that , Jonathan . She ’s different . Trust me . ”
41511	41532	41562	41562	Logan	75	“ If you say so . She seems nice enough , the few minutes she was n’t glaring at you . ”
41552	41561	41606	41606	he	79	“ I ’ll make it up to her , ”
41612	41622	41625	41625	his	75	“ You said she wo n’t hold a grudge ? ”
41628	41638	41650	41650	Jonathan	79	“ And that she ’s different from most women ? ”
41639	41649	41650	41650	Jonathan	79	“ Where are you going with this , Jonathan ? ”
41658	41699	41737	41737	He	75	“ She ’s definitely different , I ’ll give her that . I ’m thinking she was so overcome at the news of your wealth that she felt the need to run . Your ladylove just escaped in a cab . ”
41742	41751	41758	41758	He	75	“ Where do you think she ’s going ? ”
41752	41757	41787	41787	Jonathan	79	“ Away from you ? ”
41777	41786	41787	41787	Jonathan	79	“ Go tell your driver to follow them . ”
41794	41822	41835	41835	He	75	“ You ’re joking , right ? She ’s a free woman . She ’s allowed to leave . Why do n’t you call her and apologize ? ”
41849	41857	41858	41858	Jonathan	79	“ I do n’t have her number . ”
41868	41895	42088	42088	Sharon	84	“ So call your private investigator and ask him to look her up . There ca n’t be that many Brontës running around , can there ? ”
42097	42102	42108	42108	she	84	“ You ’re home ! ”
42103	42107	42108	42108	she	84	“ I am , ”
42121	42128	42197	42197	She	84	“ Did you get home okay ? ”
42129	42196	42197	42197	She	84	“ I did ! Did you know that my passport was in the bar ? Silly me . Anyhow , a nice man found it and gave it to me just before I got on a bus . I ended up spending the rest of the trip in some low - rent hotel on Miami Beach . It was free , but it was n’t great . ”
42200	42232	42253	42253	Sharon	84	“ I tried calling you , though . You never answered and I could n’t find you , and I could n’t stick around . Which bus did you get on ? ”
42259	42280	42281	42281	Sharon	84	“ I did n’t get on a bus . I got stuck in an elevator when the power went out . ”
42287	42293	42305	42305	she	84	“ The power went out ? ”
42294	42304	42337	42337	Brontë	85	“ Misfortune shows those who are not really friends , ”
42354	42369	42375	42375	She	84	“ That ’s right . I was stuck in there for almost a day . ”
42370	42374	42375	42375	She	84	“ By yourself ? ”
42380	42390	42409	42409	She	84	“ No , there was a guy in there . ”
42403	42408	42409	42409	She	84	“ Was he hot ? ”
42416	42435	42445	42445	her	85	“ You ’re blushing . He was hot , was n’t he ? Did you two hook up ? ”
42436	42440	42441	42441	Brontë	85	“ Island fling , ”
42449	42456	42463	42463	Sharon	84	“ Just like we talked about . ”
42457	42462	42463	42463	Sharon	84	“ How totally romantic ! ”
42476	42494	42503	42503	Brontë	85	“ So it was just you two , all alone in a big resort . . . . ”
42495	42502	42503	42503	Brontë	85	“ Do n’t forget the hurricane , ”
42507	42535	42548	42548	Sharon	84	“ And anyhow , it was just a momentary thing . It ’s done . Over with . I did n’t even ask for his phone number . ”
42563	42581	42592	42592	She	85	“ Hound dog , huh ? Maybe he only looked good in the middle of a hurricane . ”
42582	42591	42708	42708	Sharon	84	“ I said he was good - looking . ”
42688	42707	42714	42714	she	84	“ If he ’s so hot and studly , why did n’t you bother to get the digits ? ”
42721	42734	42742	42742	Brontë	85	“ Was he bad in bed ? Is that why you ran ? ”
42735	42741	42742	42742	Brontë	85	“ I did n’t run , ”
42746	42755	42762	42762	Sharon	84	“ And this is none of your business . ”
42756	42761	42855	42855	She	84	“ Bad in bed , ”
42860	42863	43373	43374	the detective	1038	“ loaded , ”
43368	43372	43373	43374	the detective	1038	“ Found her , ”
43380	43404	43410	43410	Logan	75	“ I ’m sending the information over to your personal e - mail address . Let me know if you have any questions . ”
43405	43409	43979	43979	Her	85	“ Excellent work , ”
43975	43978	43979	43979	Her	85	“ Hello ? ”
43991	43998	44001	44001	her	85	“ It ’s me , Brontë . ”
44007	44015	44001	44001	her	85	“ Do n’t call me . Please . ”
44016	44020	44028	44028	She	85	“ I wanted — ”
44021	44027	44126	44126	Brontë	85	“ You ’re a liar . ”
44122	44125	44173	44173	Sharon	84	“ Hello ? ”
44163	44172	44173	44173	Sharon	84	“ Hey , Bron , it ’s me . ”
44177	44186	44173	44173	Sharon	84	“ You ’re not going to believe this . ”
44197	44202	44173	44173	Sharon	84	“ What is it ? ”
44203	44209	44214	44214	Brontë	85	“ The diner was sold . ”
44210	44213	44214	44214	Brontë	85	“ Sold ? ”
44222	44230	44173	44173	Sharon	84	“ Do we still have our jobs ? ”
44231	44258	44268	44268	Brontë	85	“ As far as I know . But the new management has called a meeting this morning at nine , and they want everyone to attend . ”
44259	44267	44448	44448	she	85	“ Gotcha . I ’ll be there . ”
44444	44447	44474	44476	the old manager	1075	“ Hi , ”
44483	44489	44495	44495	Angie	114	“ Did I miss anything ? ”
44490	44494	44495	44495	Angie	114	“ Not yet , ”
44510	44523	44529	44529	Brontë	85	“ You think the new boss is going to shut us down ? ”
44524	44528	44529	44529	Brontë	85	“ Surely not , ”
44532	44541	44564	44564	Sharon	84	“ Then why call us all in here ? ”
44552	44563	44564	44564	Sharon	84	“ Maybe he just wanted to meet us all personally ? ”
44569	44595	44604	44604	Marj	115	“ I caught a good look at him . I ’d like to meet him up close and personal . Rowr . He ’s sexy . ”
44596	44603	44604	44604	Marj	115	“ He ’s your new boss , ”
44607	44614	44621	44621	Brontë	85	“ Keep your hormones under wraps . ”
44615	44620	44621	44621	Brontë	85	“ You saw him ? ”
44624	44630	44642	44642	Sharon	84	“ Does he seem nice ? ”
44631	44641	44647	44647	She	84	“ I do n’t care if he ’s nice , ”
44656	44680	44707	44707	Sharon	84	“ I told you he was cute , did n’t I ? I think he likes me . He keeps looking over here . ”
44701	44706	44718	44718	She	84	“ Do n’t look ! ”
44710	44717	44718	44718	She	84	“ You ’re being too obvious . ”
44728	44735	44747	44752	A pair of men in suits	1078	“ Is he in the kitchen ? ”
44736	44746	44811	44811	She	84	“ Yep . Oh , here he comes now . ”
44817	44828	44873	44873	he	75	“ Which one did you say was the new owner ? ”
44832	44870	45116	45116	she	85	“ It ’s not the old geezer . The hot one . He bought the place . Seems he ’s an investor of some kind . Likes to buy businesses and turn them over for a profit . ”
45129	45141	45116	45116	she	85	“ Mr. Hawkings is the new owner of Josie ’s Diner , ”
45149	45214	45268	45268	He	75	“ Over the next few weeks , we ’re going to be looking carefully at every aspect of the business to determine where the most profit can be made . This means an inspection of purchasing , cooking , hours clocked in , and anything else you can think of . Mr. Hawkings is simply here to show you his commitment to the business . ”
45244	45267	45304	45304	She	85	“ I ’d like to meet with each of you individually so you have nothing to fear in regard to your job . ”
45295	45303	45322	45322	He	75	“ I ’ll start with Brontë Dawson . ”
45316	45321	45382	45382	She	85	“ Please follow me . ”
45374	45381	45382	45382	She	85	“ Please , have a seat . ”
45407	45424	45429	45429	He	75	“ You can drop the charade , Logan . We both know why you ’re here . ”
45425	45428	45429	45429	He	75	“ Oh ? ”
45441	45452	45468	45468	Logan	75	“ You ’re doing this to get back at me . ”
45474	45495	45500	45500	she	85	“ Perhaps you are not aware that my business excels at purchasing small , failing companies and making them profitable ? ”
45506	45520	45529	45529	his	75	“ Is that why you bought this one ? Because it was failing ? ”
45521	45524	45525	45525	he	75	“ No , ”
45535	45555	45570	45570	She	85	“ I purchased this one because I knew it was the only way I could speak to you again . ”
45556	45569	45570	45570	She	85	“ So I was right . This is about me and you . ”
45577	45594	45601	45601	he	75	“ It seemed like a bit too much of a coincidence that you showed up here . ”
45595	45600	45621	45621	Brontë	85	“ You got me , ”
45638	45648	45649	45649	Her	85	“ I did get you , did n’t I ? ”
45658	45673	45681	45681	he	75	“ The problem is , you seem to think I want more of you . ”
45674	45680	45719	45719	she	85	“ I think you do , ”
45725	45740	45747	45747	She	85	“ I think the real problem here is that you ’re mad at me . ”
45741	45746	45747	45747	She	85	“ Mad at you ? ”
45755	45775	45801	45801	Brontë	85	“ How can I be mad at you ? I do n’t even know who you are . Remember ? ”
45784	45800	45801	45801	Brontë	85	“ If you ’re not mad at me , then why avoid my phone calls ? ”
45818	45851	45801	45801	Brontë	85	“ Because I went to that island to hook up with someone . You were nothing more than an island fling . I ’m not interested in carrying on something off the island ”
45852	45857	45801	45801	Brontë	85	“ You ’re lying . ”
45858	45872	45801	45801	Brontë	85	“ You should know what it ’s like . You ’re a liar . ”
45873	45877	45889	45889	She	85	“ Am I ? ”
45878	45888	45889	45889	She	85	“ You did n’t tell me who you were . ”
45898	45951	45962	45962	His	1098	“ You let me go on and on about the hotel , all because I thought you were the manager . Except you were n’t . You were the owner . And you never bothered to share that with me . You just kept it from me and laughed behind my back . ”
45952	45961	45962	45962	His	1098	“ Is that what you think of me ? ”
45968	45983	45996	45996	she	1099	“ That I lied to you because I was laughing at you ? Truly ? ”
45984	45995	45996	45996	she	1099	“ I do n’t know what to think of you , ”
46008	46023	46051	46051	She	1099	“ I do n’t know you , remember ? You made that very clear . ”
46024	46050	46148	46148	he	1098	“ I had my reasons for keeping my identity a secret from you , Brontë , and none of my reasons involve laughing at you . ”
46135	46147	46163	46163	she	1099	“ You know who I am now , do n’t you ? ”
46151	46162	46163	46163	she	1099	“ The entire world seems to know who you are , ”
46167	46182	46190	46190	he	1098	“ Stupid me was the only one that did n’t clue in to it . ”
46183	46189	46253	46253	He	1098	“ You ’re not stupid , ”
46194	46252	46253	46253	He	1098	“ Do n’t speak of yourself like that . I doubt you ’d be familiar with my face unless you read the Wall Street Journal or followed the business section in the papers . And I ’m not even sure then . Just because you have a lot of money does n’t mean you ’re a celebrity . ”
46256	46268	46272	46272	her	1099	“ It does change how they react to you , though . ”
46279	46282	46337	46337	She	1099	“ Oh ? ”
46283	46336	46337	46337	She	1099	“ Most women I meet are more interested in my wallet than who I am . I thought I was going to be stuck in an elevator for God knows how long . I did n’t want it to be with someone who only saw dollar signs when she looked at me . ”
46347	46357	46366	46366	he	1100	“ You should have had more faith in me . ”
46358	46365	46366	46366	he	1100	“ I did n’t know you , ”
46378	46431	46445	46445	She	85	“ We spent days together , and I feel like we still do n’t know enough about each other . The time we had ? It was n’t enough . I want more time with you , Brontë . I want to learn about you , and you to learn about me . ”
46450	46466	46467	46467	He	1100	“ How do I know that ’s not a line you tell all the girls ? ”
46478	46516	46467	46467	He	1100	“ Call my assistant . She ’ll tell you how many women I ’ve dated in the last year . And then ask her how many women I asked to see again . The answer is none . ”
46520	46530	46538	46538	he	1100	“ How would she know about your dating life ? ”
46531	46537	46547	46547	his	1100	“ She schedules my reservations , ”
46550	46563	46564	46564	Brontë	85	“ She knows my personal business because it ’s her job to . ”
46580	46602	46614	46614	he	1100	“ Why me ? You can have anyone you want . Why waste your time with a waitress from Kansas City ? ”
46603	46613	46630	46630	she	85	“ Because you treat me like a regular guy , ”
46636	46709	46630	46630	she	85	“ Because you make me smile . Because you light up when you find a perfect quote for the situation , and I love to see that . Because you ’re smart and funny and down - to - earth , and that ’s a rare combination in a pretty woman . Because you thought I was no one , and you still took your top off to swim naked with me . ”
46717	46732	46743	46743	he	1101	“ I was trying to have an island fling , thank you very much . ”
46733	46742	46743	46743	he	1101	“ But now we ’re off the island , ”
46747	46758	46630	46630	she	85	“ And I ’m still interested in flinging with you . ”
46759	46809	46743	46743	he	1101	“ Logan , I do n’t know . You ’re not the guy I thought you were . I was n’t intimidated when I thought you were some guy with a hundred grand a year salary . Now you ’re some guy with two hundred million dollars in businesses . ”
46810	46820	46821	46821	She	85	“ Actually , it ’s more like two billion . ”
46825	46828	46843	46843	Her	85	“ Technically . ”
46829	46842	46843	46843	Her	85	“ And you bought this diner just to meet with me again ? ”
46850	46861	46862	46862	She	85	“ Do you want this place ? It ’s yours . ”
46873	46906	46942	46942	She	85	“ No , absolutely not . I do n’t want it . I do n’t want my friends to lose their jobs just because you want me to date you , though . ”
46907	46941	46942	46942	She	85	“ Your friends are safe . I do n’t plan on interfering with business . Improving it , yes . Shutting it down , no . I would n’t hurt you like that . ”
46948	46952	46965	46965	she	85	“ Thank you . ”
46984	47005	46965	46965	she	85	“ Do n’t thank me . It has nothing to do with your decision . I ’m not a monster . ”
47006	47031	47047	47047	She	85	“ So if I told you that I never wanted to see you again , you would n’t close the diner out of revenge ? ”
47032	47046	47047	47047	She	85	“ I would not . Even I can take a hint , Brontë . ”
47054	47066	47074	47074	He	1102	“ You have n’t been very good at it so far . ”
47092	47117	47118	47118	His	1102	“ I liked what we had before . I liked waking up with you beside me . I liked wrapping my arms around you . ”
47124	47135	47191	47191	Her	1103	“ I liked watching you play naked on the beach . ”
47136	47147	47184	47184	her	1103	“ Boy , you sure are focused on the naked — ”
47148	47180	47199	47199	he	1102	“ I also liked just talking with you , and laughing with you . Just being normal Logan with normal Brontë , having a dinner of M&M ’s and scavenged crackers . ”
47215	47234	47235	47235	She	1103	“ Will you give me another chance , Brontë ? A chance to get to know you better ? ”
47239	47261	47296	47296	She	1103	“ But I want things to be normal between us . No more buying companies just to get close to me . ”
47286	47295	47379	47379	He	1102	“ No more buying companies . Got it . ”
47373	47378	47414	47414	she	1103	“ Logan , I — ”
47408	47413	47414	47414	she	1103	“ I missed you , ”
47421	47429	47436	47436	He	1102	“ Wow , that just sounded stupid . ”
47430	47435	47438	47438	himself	1102	“ Not to me . ”
47444	47449	47477	47477	She	1103	“ Was that Plato ? ”
47469	47476	47477	47477	She	1103	“ You think everything is Plato . ”
47492	47518	47527	47527	her	1103	“ So , um , do you live in Kansas City , too ? I thought the articles said you live in New York City . ”
47519	47523	47527	47527	her	1103	“ I do . ”
47530	47541	47553	47553	he	1102	“ Then how are we going to see each other ? ”
47542	47552	47553	47553	he	1102	“ I thought you ’d come back with me , ”
47557	47572	47627	47627	him	1102	“ Stay with me for a few weeks . See if we still click . ”
47631	47638	47655	47655	he	1102	“Say you ’ll come with me . ”
47639	47647	47689	47689	he	1102	“ I do n’t know . I — ”
47695	47705	47710	47710	Logan	75	“ Say you ’ll come with me , Brontë . ”
47706	47709	47726	47726	she	1103	“ I — ”
47722	47725	47726	47726	she	1103	“ Okay , ”
47737	47760	47761	47761	Brontë	85	“ You do n’t have to convince me again . This ’ll just be vacation two - point - oh or something . ”
47774	47792	47808	47808	She	85	“ I do n’t suppose you have a nice , low - key little flat in Manhattan ? ”
47793	47807	47808	47808	She	85	“ I own several nice , low - key little high - rises . ”
47813	47825	47826	47826	He	1102	“ Forget I asked . So when are we doing this ? ”
47833	47836	47880	47880	her	85	“ Now ? ”
47837	47850	47874	47874	Brontë	85	“ Now ? Do n’t you have to interview the other employees ? ”
47851	47873	47906	47906	He	1102	“ The consultant’ll take care of that . I hired him for that reason . You and I have other plans . ”
47889	47905	47906	47906	He	1102	“ You ’re not good at people telling you ‘ no , ’ are you ? ”
47920	47931	47946	47946	she	85	“ I ’d rather hear you saying ‘ yes . ’ ”
47970	47982	47993	47993	Logan	75	“ I ’m definitely more of a ‘ yes ’ girl . ”
47983	47992	47993	47993	Logan	75	“ So this is a yes , then ? ”
47998	48005	48071	48071	His	1102	“ Do you need more proof ? ”
48030	48070	48071	48071	His	1102	“ I told you I like you . I ’m not exactly sure that we ’re a good fit , but I ’m willing to see where this goes . ‘ Fortune favors the bold ’ and all that . ”
48081	48092	48101	48101	Her	85	“ I love it when you talk Plato to me . ”
48093	48100	48120	48120	She	85	“ Virgil , baby . Virgil . ”
48106	48119	48158	48158	He	1102	“ Mmm . I wish we were somewhere private right about now . ”
48136	48157	48203	48203	she	85	“ Come with me . I ’m wanting to test that ‘ fortune favoring the bold ’ thing right now . ”
48189	48194	48203	48203	she	85	“ Cold in here . ”
48195	48202	48203	48203	she	85	“ I ’ll warm you up , ”
48206	48210	48236	48236	he	1102	“ Come here . ”
48248	48274	48277	48277	her	85	“ You sure you want to do this here , Brontë ? Once I start kissing you again , I ’m not going to stop . ”
48291	48303	48324	48324	Logan	75	“ Think anyone is going to follow us into the kitchen ? ”
48315	48323	48324	48324	Logan	75	“ Not if they value their jobs , ”
48327	48344	48357	48357	she	85	“ I made it quite clear to the consultant that we were not to be disturbed . ”
48345	48356	48383	48383	she	85	“ Then we do n’t have anything to worry about , ”
48392	48414	48426	48426	he	1102	“ You do n’t have anything else to tell me , do you ? Secret marriage ? Bodies in the backyard ? ”
48415	48425	48426	48426	he	1102	“ I ’m afraid that I am alarmingly dull , ”
48433	48446	48491	48491	she	85	“ No kids . No wives . No bodies in the backyard . ”
48477	48490	48491	48491	she	85	“ Seems like I ’m getting the raw end of this deal , ”
48500	48506	48514	48514	Logan	75	“ You sound terribly boring . ”
48507	48513	48570	48570	her	85	“ Terribly , terribly boring , ”
48573	48582	48597	48597	he	75	“ Your mouth makes my panties so wet . ”
48592	48596	48607	48607	she	85	“ Plato again ? ”
48602	48606	48607	48607	she	85	“ Brontë Dawson , ”
48611	48625	48645	48645	his	75	“ I hear she ’s got a thing for tall , dull guys . ”
48626	48638	48677	48677	her	85	“ It ’s a lucky day to be a dull guy . ”
48691	48700	48716	48716	His	75	“ I do n’t suppose you brought condoms ? ”
48710	48715	48835	48835	she	85	“ We ’re good . ”
48799	48824	48835	48835	she	85	“ We ’ll have to be quiet unless we want to broadcast to your coworkers exactly what you ’re doing with your new boss . ”
48825	48834	48835	48835	she	85	“ I ’m thinking they ’ve already guessed , ”
48851	48868	49034	49034	he	75	“ And I ’m thinking I do n’t care that much . I just want you . ”
49026	49033	49053	49053	she	85	“ I want you , Brontë , ”
49044	49052	49053	49053	she	85	“ I want you too , Logan , ”
49065	49071	49331	49331	she	85	“ Make love to me . ”
49343	49346	49384	49384	he	75	“ Please . ”
49380	49383	49384	49384	he	75	“ Brontë , ”
49405	49409	49414	49414	she	85	“ My Brontë . ”
49410	49413	49451	49451	she	85	“ Yours , ”
49465	49470	49739	49739	she	85	“ Yours , Logan . ”
49727	49738	49739	49739	she	85	“ Can I make a suggestion to my new manager ? ”
49748	49752	49762	49762	she	85	“ Ask away . ”
49753	49761	49787	49787	He	75	“ I recommend tossing out this food , ”
49765	49786	49787	49787	He	75	“ I do n’t know that I could serve it to anyone after knowing what we just did in here . ”
49790	49820	49856	49856	He	75	“ I ’ll take that into consideration . But you ’re not going to be here to serve it , Brontë . You ’re going to be with me . ”
49821	49855	49787	49787	He	75	“ I should n’t go with you , but I ’m going to anyhow . The others are going to talk a mile a minute if I leave with you for a week . ”
49885	49902	49918	49918	she	85	“ You can tell them you ’re doing training at my corporate office if anyone asks . ”
49903	49917	49936	49936	Logan	75	“ I ’m not sure they ’d approve of that kind of training , ”
49925	49935	49936	49936	Logan	75	“ They would n’t dare say anything to you , ”
49939	49943	49948	49948	she	85	“ Not if — ”
49944	49947	49974	49974	he	75	“ Logan , ”
49955	49973	49974	49974	he	75	“ You ’re going to the corporate office to represent your company for a few business meetings , ”
49985	49994	50163	50163	Logan	75	“ A few friendly , intimate business meetings . ”
50151	50162	50200	50200	Brontë	85	“ The next employee on the list is Marj Davis . ”
50177	50199	50260	50261	the consultant	2502	“ I ’ve got another appointment to get to . I trust you ’ll be able to handle it from here ? ”
50250	50259	50260	50261	the consultant	2502	“ Everything ’s under control , Mr. Hawkings , ”
50264	50276	50281	50281	Logan	75	“ I ’ll send you my full report in the morning . ”
50277	50280	50295	50295	He	75	“ Excellent , ”
50310	50320	50397	50397	she	85	“ I ’ll be taking Miss Dawson with me . ”
50393	50396	50397	50397	she	85	“ Well , ”
50410	50427	50428	50428	He	75	“ That ’s going to make things awkward when I have to go back to work . ”
50443	50453	50460	50460	God	93	“ Should I have the consultant speak to them ? ”
50454	50459	50460	50460	God	93	“ What ? No ! ”
50472	50506	50514	50514	He	75	“ Let ’s just forget about it . I ’ll give it a few days to die down before I come back . I ’ll talk with the manager about clearing my schedule . ”
50507	50513	50533	50533	She	85	“ I ’m clearing it . ”
50541	50546	50557	50557	Her	85	“ For how long ? ”
50547	50556	50571	50571	she	85	“ Indefinitely . I want you with me . ”
50597	50609	50615	50615	he	75	“ And I ’ll have my job when I get back ? ”
50610	50614	50658	50658	she	85	“ You will , ”
50647	50657	50719	50719	She	85	“ A happy life consists in tranquillity of mind , ”
50731	50737	50746	50746	She	85	“ I drove myself here . ”
50753	50762	50767	50767	He	75	“ You want to drive to my apartment ? ”
50763	50766	50767	50767	He	75	“ No . ”
50778	50823	50767	50767	He	75	“ I was n’t lying , Brontë . I do have a meeting I have to get to back in the city . We do n’t have time to go back to your apartment . I can have someone drive your car back safely . ”
50828	50849	50860	50860	he	75	“ You want me to go with you ? Right now ? I do n’t have any of my stuff . ”
50869	50899	50907	50907	she	85	“ I need to go , but I ’m not letting you out of my sight again . So , yes , I want you to come with me . ”
50900	50906	50907	50907	she	85	“ I ’ll need clothes , ”
50911	50917	50936	50936	her	85	“ I have credit cards . ”
50942	50980	51005	51005	he	75	“ So you ’re going to buy me a plane ticket , put me up in a hotel , buy me clothes , and pay me a salary , all so I can spend time with you ? ”
50981	50986	51005	51005	he	75	“ That ’s right . ”
50987	51002	51005	51005	he	75	“ That puts all the power in your hands , do n’t you think ? ”
51011	51025	51005	51005	he	75	“ I did n’t get where I am by letting others have control . ”
51039	51049	51067	51067	She	85	“ I do n’t like being a kept woman . ”
51050	51066	51110	51110	she	85	“ Think of them as necessary expenses for my new . . . philosophy consultant . ”
51105	51109	51110	51110	she	85	“ All right , ”
51121	51135	51149	51149	Logan	75	“ But if you start picking out my clothes , I ’m leaving . ”
51136	51148	51149	51149	Logan	75	“ I do n’t know a thing about women ’s sizes , ”
51157	51165	51206	51206	Logan	75	“ You ’re safe on that count . ”
51216	51220	51237	51237	Logan	75	“ Where to ? ”
51233	51236	51252	51252	He	75	“ Airport . ”
51266	51274	51252	51252	He	75	“ Ever ridden on a private plane ? ”
51275	51282	51252	51252	He	75	“ Never . You have one ? ”
51283	51288	51293	51293	she	85	“ Two , actually . ”
51289	51292	51293	51293	she	85	“ Naturally , ”
51296	51313	51482	51482	Logan	75	“ Let me guess . Two , just in case the other needs an oil change ? ”
51476	51481	51487	51487	his	75	“ Have a seat , ”
51495	51514	51519	51519	She	85	“ If you ’re tired , you can take a nap in the bedroom after we take off . ”
51515	51518	51519	51519	She	85	“ Bedroom ? ”
51525	51534	51535	51535	He	75	“ You have a bedroom on this thing ? ”
51538	51552	51598	51598	Brontë	85	“ Sometimes I have to take late flights . It makes things easier . ”
51592	51597	51598	51598	Brontë	85	“ We ’re here . ”
51611	51615	51598	51598	Brontë	85	“ We are ? ”
51616	51641	51703	51703	Logan	75	“ Yes . We have just enough time to get you situated upstairs , and then I have to head off to my meeting . ”
51714	51724	51730	51730	Logan	75	“ Wait here . I wo n’t be long . ”
51748	51762	51771	51771	She	85	“ I ’ll show you my place , and you can get comfortable . ”
51763	51770	51787	51787	Logan	75	“ Do you have to go ? ”
51802	51820	51856	51856	She	85	“ It ’s a meeting I ’ve rescheduled twice already . I wo n’t reschedule it again . ”
51842	51855	51948	51948	Logan	75	“ When I get back , we can go out to dinner . ”
51955	51958	51963	51963	she	85	“ Uncomfortable ? ”
51959	51962	51963	51963	she	85	“ Nah , ”
51971	51999	52011	52011	he	75	“ Just thinking that everyone in this building pays more in rent per month than what I make all year . What would make a girl nervous ? ”
52000	52010	52011	52011	he	75	“ Do n’t worry about what other people think , ”
52024	52033	52021	52021	his	75	“ You ’re gorgeous just as you are . ”
52034	52041	52011	52011	he	75	“ Easy for you to say . ”
52042	52048	52062	52062	She	85	“ It is , yes . ”
52072	52088	52104	52104	Brontë	85	“ It ’s just going to take a bit of getting used to for me . ”
52119	52125	52137	52137	He	75	“ Is this your apartment ? ”
52126	52136	52168	52168	He	75	“ It ’s the only one on this floor . ”
52156	52167	52168	52168	He	75	“ You have an entire floor ? For one person ? ”
52171	52180	52187	52187	she	85	“ Would you prefer I had a studio ? ”
52181	52186	52231	52231	he	75	“ Studios are cozy , ”
52202	52222	52474	52474	Logan	75	“ I prefer more living space . A studio does n’t exactly set the right image for a billionaire . ”
52490	52497	52513	52513	he	75	“ This is where you live ? ”
52520	52530	52567	52567	He	75	“ When I ’m in the city , yes . ”
52558	52566	52567	52567	He	75	“ How many rooms is this place ? ”
52570	52582	52587	52587	she	85	“ I do n’t recall . Four guest bedrooms ? Five ? ”
52583	52586	52587	52587	she	85	“ Naturally , ”
52590	52600	52606	52606	his	75	“ Every bachelor needs at least five guest bedrooms . ”
52617	52622	52630	52630	she	85	“ Are you uncomfortable ? ”
52623	52629	52657	52657	He	75	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
52648	52656	52661	52661	his	75	“ How long will you be gone ? ”
52664	52704	52762	52762	his	75	“ Three hours , depending on traffic , of course . If you need anything , dial nine on the phone . That ’ll forward your call to my assistant , and she can get you anything you need . ”
52705	52708	52723	52723	She	85	“ Gotcha . ”
52709	52722	52741	52741	she	85	“ What do you want for dinner ? I ’ll make reservations . ”
52751	52755	52756	52756	He	75	“ You pick . ”
52768	52778	52793	52793	she	85	“ I should go so I ’m not late . ”
52786	52792	52793	52793	she	85	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
52801	52839	52849	52849	he	75	“ Seriously . It ’ll probably take me three hours to figure out how to work the remote on your TV . Or discover where the TV is . You ’ll be back before I know it . ”
52840	52848	52849	52849	he	75	“ If you need anything , call , ”
52859	52902	52984	52984	Logan	75	“ Or if you ’re thinking of me , call . Actually , think of me anyhow . I know I ’m not going to be able to take my mind off of you here in my home , waiting for me . ”
52991	52998	53020	53020	She	85	“ I ’ll be back soon . ”
53013	53019	53550	53550	he	75	“ I ’ll be here . ”
53546	53549	53563	53563	she	85	“ Tired ? ”
53557	53562	53563	53563	she	85	“ More like bored , ”
53570	53589	53598	53598	he	75	“ Did you know that you have six remotes ? And none of them turn on the TV ? ”
53590	53597	53598	53598	he	75	“ It ’s voice - activated , ”
53605	53615	53563	53563	she	85	“ I can show you how to use it . ”
53616	53636	53563	53563	she	85	“ I ’m afraid to touch it . Actually , I ’m afraid to touch most everything in here . ”
53637	53640	53651	53651	He	75	“ Why ? ”
53641	53650	53651	53651	He	75	“ It ’s expensive . All of it . ”
53654	53665	53777	53777	He	75	“ My home is your home while you ’re here . ”
53789	53798	53853	53853	Logan	75	“ Do you not want to be here ? ”
53815	53852	53853	53853	Logan	75	“ No , I want to be here . I think I ’d just feel better if this did n’t look like a museum . You need a puppy to dirty this place up or something . ”
53863	53868	53875	53875	Her	85	“ I have you . ”
53869	53874	53895	53895	his	75	“ Gee , thanks . ”
53901	53915	53921	53921	he	75	“ I ’m glad you ’re back . Did your meeting go well ? ”
53916	53920	53921	53921	he	75	“ Well enough , ”
53924	53946	53921	53921	he	75	“ We have a cocktail party to go to tomorrow night . I want you to meet some of my friends . ”
53953	53962	53895	53895	his	75	“ I do n’t have clothes for that . ”
53963	53978	53993	53993	He	75	“ Tell my assistant your size . She can pick out something for you . ”
53979	53992	53993	53993	He	75	“ I ’d like to buy my own clothing , thank you . ”
54004	54015	54016	54016	Brontë	85	“ I suppose you should change for dinner , too . ”
54019	54030	54048	54048	She	85	“ Logan , I do n’t have anything to wear . ”
54031	54047	54083	54083	Brontë	85	“ We can stop by a store and pick something up on the way out . ”
54089	54109	54110	54110	His	75	“ Ca n’t we just stay in bed tonight ? Surely you can get a pizza delivered or something . ”
54118	54121	54127	54127	She	85	“ Chinese ? ”
54122	54126	54157	54157	She	85	“ Sounds delicious . ”
54149	54156	54157	54157	She	85	“ I ’ll get my assistant — ”
54172	54199	54205	54205	he	75	“ Or we could just order it ourselves . You know , like normal people . You do n’t have to call your assistant for everything . ”
54200	54204	54205	54205	he	75	“ You win , ”
54215	54224	54205	54205	he	75	“ You order , and I ’ll pay ? ”
54225	54228	54314	54314	She	85	“ Deal . ”
54306	54313	54317	54317	her	85	“ Exactly how hungry are you ? ”
54324	54333	54338	54338	he	75	“ Mm , not so hungry just yet . ”
54334	54337	54361	54361	he	75	“ Good , ”
54370	54380	54385	54385	Her	85	“ I thought about you through my entire meeting . ”
54381	54384	54423	54423	Brontë	85	“ Oh ? ”
54397	54422	54423	54423	Brontë	85	“ I liked the thought of you in my house , in my bed . Though , in my daydreams , you were naked . ”
54426	54437	54438	54438	He	75	“ In my daydreams , your library had real books . ”
54450	54467	54473	54474	This man	1175	“ If you want real books , buy some . Buy as many as you want . ”
54485	54500	54507	54507	he	75	“ I did n’t come here to shop . I came here for you . ”
54501	54506	54525	54525	He	75	“ So you did , ”
54542	54552	54562	54562	she	85	“ I find that very . . . arousing . ”
54553	54561	54573	54573	She	85	“ I find your touch very arousing , ”
54584	54594	54633	54633	he	75	“ Though you ’re wearing entirely too much clothing . ”
54623	54632	54844	54844	she	85	“ I could say the same of you , ”
54836	54843	54844	54844	she	85	“ I want you , Logan , ”
54847	54857	54858	54858	His	75	“ I need to feel your skin against mine . ”
54865	54869	54886	54886	He	75	“ You first . ”
54895	54902	54924	54924	He	75	“ I think you forgot something . ”
54903	54923	54924	54924	He	75	“ I had a rendezvous with my lover in a freezer earlier , and I had to discard them . ”
54930	54934	54947	54947	she	85	“ Lucky man . ”
54942	54946	54973	54973	he	75	“ He is , ”
54981	54992	55058	55058	she	85	“ He ’s also still wearing entirely too much clothing . ”
55047	55057	55162	55162	she	85	“ I want you naked on top of me , ”
55173	55185	55193	55193	his	75	“ ‘ Short is the joy that guilty pleasure brings . ’ ”
55196	55206	55207	55207	Brontë	85	“ Are you using Plato to criticize my techniques ? ”
55219	55233	55234	55234	She	85	“ Not at all . Just sad that it did n’t last longer . ”
55242	55252	55207	55207	Brontë	85	“ And I ’m pretty sure that was Euripides . ”
55253	55260	55265	55265	She	85	“ Ah . Good old Euripides . ”
55261	55264	55265	55265	She	85	“ Mmmm . ”
55273	55283	55342	55342	She	85	“ You are still wearing entirely too much clothing . ”
55330	55341	55371	55371	Logan	75	“ Now I have you right where I want you . ”
55363	55370	55374	55374	his	75	“ And I want you naked . ”
55389	55400	55408	55408	She	85	“ I think I like you on top of me . ”
55401	55407	55472	55472	her	85	“ Do you , now ? ”
55486	55493	55500	55500	he	75	“ I love looking at you . ”
55494	55499	55534	55534	He	75	“ It ’s mutual , ”
55529	55533	55612	55612	He	75	“ Clothes off . ”
55600	55611	55689	55689	he	75	“ Now we need to get rid of these pants . ”
55682	55688	55758	55758	she	85	“ I like you there , ”
55752	55757	55758	55758	she	85	“ You ’re right , ”
55761	55767	55775	55775	he	75	“ This definitely has merit . ”
55768	55774	55775	55775	he	75	“ We need a condom , ”
55783	55788	55818	55818	She	85	“ In the nightstand . ”
55829	55836	55842	55842	he	75	“ Shall I do the honors ? ”
55837	55841	55913	55913	he	75	“ Please do , ”
55909	55912	55923	55923	she	85	“ Tease , ”
55916	55922	56264	56264	he	75	“ You like being teased , ”
56260	56263	56378	56378	Logan	75	“ Brontë , ”
56388	56405	56378	56378	Logan	75	“ Why do n’t you jump in the shower , and I ’ll order the food ? ”
56406	56417	56564	56564	He	75	“ You know how to sweet - talk a girl . ”
56577	56597	56617	56617	Logan	75	“ I have meetings all day , but I ’ll be back in time to pick you up tonight . ”
56598	56616	56617	56617	Logan	75	“ Gotcha . Is there a bookstore nearby I can hit up once I find some pants ? ”
56620	56637	56643	56643	She	85	“ You have all of New York at your disposal , and you want a bookstore ? ”
56638	56642	56643	56643	She	85	“ Pretty much . ”
56651	56659	56660	56660	He	75	“ But it comes second to pants . ”
56668	56696	56725	56725	She	85	“ Tell you what . I ’ll send my assistant over in about an hour with some clothes for you . She can escort you around town . ”
56720	56724	56758	56758	Logan	75	“ All right . ”
56745	56757	56761	56761	his	75	“ You ’re going to think about me today , right ? ”
56773	56782	56761	56761	his	75	“ I could n’t stop if I tried . ”
56783	56798	56804	56804	She	85	“ A wise man once said , ‘ We strive after the forbidden . ’ ”
56799	56803	56804	56804	She	85	“ More Plato ? ”
56809	56820	56840	56840	Logan	75	“ Everyone ’s Plato to you . That was Ovid . ”
56821	56839	56840	56840	Logan	75	“ If you find a bookstore , buy me some Plato . I hear he ’s interesting . ”
56855	56867	57022	57022	She	85	“ I ’ll call when I ’m on my way home . ”
57034	57037	57155	57155	She	1233	“ Coming . ”
57147	57154	57155	57155	She	1233	“ You must be Brontë Dawson . ”
57161	57190	57191	57191	Brontë	85	“ My name is Audrey Petty , and I ’m Logan ’s assistant . He asked me to come by and see if I could help out today . ”
57197	57209	57219	57219	Her	125	“ Hi there . Yes . I ’m Logan ’s girlfriend . ”
57227	57257	57264	57264	Brontë	85	“ Well , Logan told me to come by with some clothes so you could go shopping today . It seems he did n’t give you time to pack ? ”
57258	57263	57285	57285	She	125	“ That ’s right . ”
57277	57284	57285	57285	She	125	“ Sorry to be such trouble . ”
57292	57331	57341	57341	Audrey	125	“ Trouble ? Logan once asked me to drive to Pennsylvania to pick up floor plans because he did n’t like the way they looked faxed . Taking someone shopping ? That is not trouble in the slightest . ”
57358	57368	57380	57380	Audrey	125	“ Does Logan often make you run strange errands ? ”
57369	57379	57380	57380	Audrey	125	“ I do n’t know if they ’re strange , ”
57383	57416	57433	57433	Audrey	125	“ But he does sometimes ask me to run favors for him . It ’s my job as his assistant , of course . He has a secretary for other business needs . ”
57420	57432	57433	57433	Audrey	125	“ So wait . He has an assistant and a secretary ? ”
57442	57512	57519	57519	Brontë	85	“ Of course . Now , Logan told me that he had no idea what your size was , so I bought a sweater and some pants in every size . We can just return the ones that do n’t fit . I also brought some panties and bras in some common sizes . If you do n’t have shoes , I can go back out and get some . ”
57513	57518	57519	57519	Brontë	85	“ This is fine , ”
57542	57566	57578	57578	Audrey	125	“ This is nicer than what I normally wear , actually . You could have brought me a T - shirt and jeans . ”
57567	57577	57578	57578	Audrey	125	“ Not if I wanted to keep my job , ”
57582	57604	57619	57619	She	125	“ I know Logan , and if he thought I was cheaping out on you , he ’d have my head . ”
57636	57641	57675	57675	She	125	“ These ’ll work . ”
57642	57674	57675	57675	She	125	“ Super . You go change and I ’ll pack everything else up , and then we can get started . We ’ve got a lot of shopping ahead of us . ”
57682	57686	57698	57698	she	125	“ We do ? ”
57687	57697	57740	57740	She	125	“ Logan ’s instructions are , and I quote , ”
57711	57739	57758	57758	She	125	“ ‘ Make sure that she gets a few weeks ’ worth of clothing , along with some evening wear . You know my events calendar . ’ ”
57747	57757	57758	57758	She	125	“ I do , and it ’s a doozy . ”
57768	57787	57788	57788	She	125	“ ‘ Also , take her to the best bookstore in Manhattan . My library needs restocking . ’ ”
57796	57802	57808	57808	Brontë	85	“ He has a library ? ”
57803	57807	57811	57811	her	85	“ Not really , ”
57825	57842	57845	57845	her	125	“ And I really do n’t need that many clothes . Just a change or two . ”
57852	57866	57946	57946	Audrey	125	“ I have my orders , and I ’m afraid they trump yours . ”
57932	57945	57946	57946	Audrey	125	“ Thanks for the clothes . How much do I owe you ? ”
57952	57956	57966	57968	The other woman	285	“ Very funny . ”
57957	57965	57966	57968	The other woman	285	“ I can write you a check . ”
57973	58007	58008	58008	Brontë	85	“ Are you or are you not aware that you ’re dating a billionaire ? He has a little cash to throw around . This is coming from his wallet , not mine . ”
58011	58045	58057	58057	she	125	“ Just because he has the cash does n’t mean that I want him to spend ridiculous amounts on me . I ’m a grown woman . I can buy my own clothes . ”
58060	58081	58084	58084	her	125	“ Well , that ’s something I do n’t hear very often from women in Logan ’s circles . Huh . ”
58095	58135	58139	58139	She	125	“ Anyhow . Today , the shopping is on Logan . You can argue with him when he gets home . As long as you ’re with me , though , his card is the one we ’re using . ”
58162	58171	58180	58180	Audrey	125	“ Sounds good . Where are we heading ? ”
58172	58179	58180	58180	Audrey	125	“ Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue , ”
58184	58199	58209	58209	Audrey	125	“ That ’s where the best shopping is . Do you have a preference ? ”
58200	58208	58209	58209	Audrey	125	“ Someplace with reasonable , comfortable clothing ? ”
58217	58277	58280	58280	her	85	“ Oh , honey . No . We ’ll start with your dress for the party tonight . I ’m thinking Bergdorf ’s or Saks . And shoes . We ’ll definitely need some shoes . This could get a little pricey , so I just want you to close your eyes and remember who ’s buying , okay ? ”
58283	58310	58319	58319	she	85	“ Audrey , this makes me . . . really uncomfortable . I do n’t know that I can spend someone else ’s money like this . ”
58311	58318	58319	58319	she	85	“ I know you ca n’t , ”
58326	58360	58280	58280	her	85	“ That ’s why I ’m in charge . And may I just say that this is a refreshing change ? Usually I have to pry his girlfriends away from the Centurion card . ”
58361	58374	58389	58389	Audrey	125	“ I thought he had n’t dated much in the past year ? ”
58375	58388	58389	58389	Audrey	125	“ He has n’t . I ’ve been with him for several . ”
58398	58403	58662	58662	Audrey	125	“ Shall we go ? ”
58665	58670	58690	58690	Audrey	125	“ Especially after Danica . ”
58684	58689	58690	58690	Audrey	125	“ Who ’s Danica ? ”
58699	58752	58767	58768	The assistant	1262	“ I should n’t have said anything . Except . . . the party tonight ? You ’re going to be there , and the other guests on the list ? They all know about Danica , and someone ’s sure to bring it up even if she does n’t show up . ”
58761	58766	58767	58768	The assistant	1262	“ Who ’s Danica ? ”
58771	58800	58805	58805	Brontë	85	“ I really should n’t tell you . My number one loyalty is to Logan , and this feels disloyal . It ’s not my place to speculate — ”
58801	58804	58805	58805	Brontë	85	“ Audrey , ”
58808	58823	58838	58838	she	285	“ Who is Danica , and why do I need to know about her ? ”
58841	58852	58862	58862	He	1264	“ Danica is Logan ’s fiancée . Ex - fiancée . ”
58868	58878	58899	58899	Her	85	“ Exactly how ex of a fiancée is she ? ”
58879	58898	58945	58945	Audrey	125	“ They broke things off about two years ago . He has n’t really dated anyone seriously since . ”
58937	58944	58945	58945	Audrey	125	“ Why did they break up ? ”
58948	59016	58945	58945	Audrey	125	“ I ca n’t speculate . That ’s Logan ’s business and not something he shared with me . But I do know it was ugly . They ’re not speaking . That ’s why you have to look stellar at this party tonight . Odds are that she ’s going to be there , and you ca n’t give her any reason to pick you apart . ”
59021	59050	59134	59135	The assistant	1262	“ I ’m a waitress . I ’m dating a billionaire . You do n’t think that ’s reason enough for her to want to tear me apart ? ”
59051	59066	59080	59080	Audrey	125	“ It is . You just do n’t want to give her any more . ”
59067	59079	59080	59080	Audrey	125	“ ‘ The wise learn many things from their enemies . ’ ”
59087	59090	59102	59102	Audrey	125	“ Huh ? ”
59091	59101	59102	59102	Audrey	125	“ Oh . Um . Aristophanes . Never mind . ”
59111	59133	59134	59135	The assistant	1262	“ We can start here . They have some really nice selections . Sophisticated and moneyed . Nothing that screams streetwalker . ”
59146	59191	59201	59201	Brontë	85	“ Not that I think you would have trouble with that , but you never know . Some women think that if they ’re spending a lot , the clothes should have a lot of flash . It ’s just the opposite , really . ”
59192	59200	59419	59419	She	125	“ I ’ll keep that in mind , ”
59383	59418	59419	59419	She	125	“ You have such lovely dark hair and pale skin that I think you could probably look great in a nice jewel tone . Maybe blue ? Green ? Do you have a preference ? ”
59429	59434	59457	59457	Audrey	125	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
59444	59456	59457	59457	Audrey	125	“ I really do n’t feel comfortable with the prices here . ”
59464	59473	59476	59476	her	125	“ Are you still going on about this ? ”
59491	59590	59595	59595	Audrey	125	“ You are dating a billionaire . Wearing T - shirts and jeans is fine for at home , if that ’s your thing . But if you go out ? People are going to look at what he ’s wearing , and they ’re going to look at what you ’re wearing . You have to convey an image . The functions that Logan attends ? They frequently make the society pages . The last thing you want is for someone to point out fabulously wealthy and handsome Logan Hawkings and his thrift store girlfriend . Understand ? ”
59602	59671	59743	59743	Brontë	85	“ Do I need to call Logan ? Because if we do n’t get you outfitted appropriately , I ’m the one who ’s going to be in trouble , Brontë . As his assistant , it ’s my job to make him look good . And if you look good , he looks good . And I really like my job and would hate to lose it . ”
59672	59679	59687	59687	Audrey	125	“ That is totally emotional blackmail . ”
59680	59686	59743	59743	Brontë	85	“ Yes , it is . ”
59703	59710	60292	60292	She	85	“ Now , green or blue ? ”
60284	60291	60292	60292	She	85	“ You look gorgeous , Brontë . ”
60297	60305	60324	60324	his	75	“ I look expensive , you mean . ”
60306	60319	60328	60328	his	75	“ You do , but it ’s perfect for the party tonight . ”
60337	60342	60387	60387	she	85	“ You ’re perfect . ”
60373	60386	60443	60443	He	75	“ I did n’t know you were going to work so late , ”
60409	60442	60469	60469	She	85	“ Note my apology . I had a few meetings that ran late . If I ’d have known you were so incredibly gorgeous while waiting for me , though . . . ”
60462	60468	60469	60469	She	85	“ I like this part . ”
60480	60488	60497	60497	Her	85	“ What time does the party start ? ”
60489	60496	60502	60502	she	85	“ About a half hour ago . ”
60509	60525	60542	60542	he	75	“ So we ’re late ? Please tell me this is n’t a dinner party . ”
60536	60541	60542	60542	he	75	“ Just a mixer , ”
60548	60561	60592	60592	he	75	“ Some close friends and business associates . Nothing to worry about . ”
60575	60578	60588	60588	His	75	“ business associates ”
60598	60606	60612	60612	She	85	“ I think your dress needs something . ”
60607	60611	60646	60646	He	75	“ Does it ? ”
60635	60645	60649	60649	his	75	“ I thought I looked pretty good , myself . ”
60668	60675	60649	60649	his	75	“ See if you like this . ”
60688	60709	60716	60716	he	75	“ Oh , Logan . You should n’t have . Really . Whatever you spent , it ’s too much . ”
60710	60715	60716	60716	he	75	“ Look at it , ”
60725	60753	60837	60837	She	85	“ I tried to find one like in the gift shop . Now that you know that I have money , I can give you these things . ”
60851	60860	60917	60917	her	85	“ I ca n’t take this , Logan . ”
60861	60878	60920	60920	he	75	“ I want you to wear it , Brontë . You ’ll look beautiful in it . ”
60879	60915	60920	60920	he	75	“ It ’s too much . I ’m already wearing stuff that ’s way more expensive than it should be . You ’re spending too much money , Logan . I do n’t like it . ”
60932	60936	60950	60950	Logan	75	“ Turn around . ”
60963	60971	60976	60976	he	75	“ Do you always get your way ? ”
60972	60975	60989	60989	She	85	“ Always , ”
60984	60988	61000	61000	he	75	“ Turn around . ”
61014	61021	61028	61028	He	75	“ Thank you , I think . ”
61022	61027	61028	61028	He	75	“ You ’re welcome . ”
61037	61041	61203	61203	Logan	75	“ I think . ”
61196	61202	61273	61273	Brontë	85	“ Are you all right ? ”
61267	61272	61273	61273	Brontë	85	“ I ’m okay , ”
61277	61281	61287	61287	She	85	“ Just nervous . ”
61282	61286	61287	61287	She	85	“ I know . ”
61292	61298	61314	61314	His	75	“ How do you know ? ”
61299	61313	61314	61314	His	75	“ You have this strange giggle that you do when you ’re nervous . ”
61323	61337	61338	61338	She	85	“ That , and you ’ve got a death grip on my sleeve . ”
61346	61349	61356	61356	He	75	“ Sorry . ”
61350	61355	61368	61368	His	75	“ Do n’t be . ”
61387	61420	61431	61431	she	85	“ You look utterly delectable . If we were n’t heading to this party , I might be convinced to stop this elevator and see what you ’re wearing under that dress . ”
61421	61430	61431	61431	she	85	“ I ’ll spoil the suspense for you , ”
61435	61438	61439	61439	He	75	“ Nothing . ”
61449	61456	61471	61471	She	85	“ No tan lines , either ? ”
61457	61470	61473	61473	her	85	“ Nope . I spent my day at the beach totally nude . ”
61481	61491	61497	61497	He	75	“ I had good company , if I recall . ”
61492	61496	61569	61569	he	75	“ The best . ”
61564	61568	61714	61714	She	85	“ Very funny , ”
61700	61713	61836	61836	They	1312	“ Come on . We should go say hello to our host . ”
61826	61835	61886	61886	Logan	75	“ Not even the gods fight against necessity . ”
61882	61885	61886	61886	Logan	75	“ Brontë , ”
61889	61909	61936	61936	She	472	“ I want you to meet my newest business partner , Doyle Bullet , and his wife , Rita . ”
61942	61954	61955	61955	Rita	129	“ Pleased to meet you both . I ’m Brontë Dawson . ”
61962	61976	61982	61982	she	472	“ How lovely to meet you . Such an unusual name , too . ”
61977	61981	61982	61982	she	472	“ Thank you , ”
61996	62022	62069	62069	Logan	75	“ It ’s not after any Brontë in particular . Or rather , any or all of them . Pick a Brontë , any Brontë . ”
62060	62068	62069	62069	Logan	75	“ Thank you for inviting us tonight , ”
62073	62086	62093	62093	Rita	129	“ And for letting me bring a friend on such late notice . ”
62087	62092	62126	62126	She	129	“ But of course , ”
62105	62125	62137	62137	Doyle	128	“ Would you excuse me ? I just want to make sure that the caterers have everything under control . ”
62142	62163	62173	62173	Logan	75	“ Do n’t suppose that you saw what the Dow closed at today ? It was a bloodbath in there . ”
62164	62172	62173	62173	Logan	75	“ I was in meetings all afternoon . ”
62188	62192	62205	62205	Doyle	128	“ What happened ? ”
62193	62204	62211	62211	He	75	“ News report about more banking scandals , of course , ”
62216	62226	62261	62261	He	75	“ Do you dabble in investments , my dear ? ”
62249	62260	62261	62261	He	75	“ No , I do n’t . I ’m sorry . ”
62268	62290	62296	62296	she	85	“ Well , you should consider it . You ’ll never make any money if you do n’t risk any money . ”
62291	62295	62322	62323	A man	2212	“ Of course , ”
62308	62321	62362	62362	he	75	“ Logan , you old dog . When did you get back ? ”
62358	62361	62362	62362	he	75	“ Cade , ”
62370	62386	62394	62394	she	85	“ I ’d like you to meet my date . Brontë , this is Cade . ”
62387	62393	62412	62412	Logan	75	“ Pleased to meet you , ”
62401	62411	62426	62426	Cade	80	“ Cade is also a business partner of mine , ”
62416	62425	62426	62426	Cade	80	“ I prefer the term ‘ friend , ’ ”
62432	62440	62441	62441	She	85	“ You know , like regular people . ”
62453	62463	62464	62464	Doyle	128	“ As I was saying , Logan . . . ”
62472	62488	62494	62494	Logan	75	“ I wanted to talk to you a bit more about the meeting this afternoon . ”
62489	62493	62494	62494	Logan	75	“ Of course , ”
62502	62524	62532	62532	Cade	80	“ Would you mind introducing Brontë to a few people ? I ’m sure this wo n’t be interesting for her . ”
62525	62531	62532	62532	Cade	80	“ I would be delighted , ”
62540	62544	62549	62549	she	85	“ Shall we ? ”
62545	62548	62603	62603	his	80	“ Sure , ”
62632	62639	62647	62647	Cade	80	“ How do you know Logan ? ”
62640	62646	62647	62647	Cade	80	“ We go way back , ”
62651	62667	62668	62668	She	85	“ College . Dartmouth . We studied business there together . Same frat and everything . ”
62674	62689	62739	62739	She	85	“ Same frat ? Logan does n’t strike me as the party boy type . ”
62690	62738	62739	62739	She	85	“ He ’s not . Even back then , he ’d glare at us over our drinks and remind us that we had a test in the morning . He ’s always been excessively responsible , I ’m afraid . He tries to keep everyone in line . ”
62742	62748	62758	62758	he	1325	“ That sounds like Logan . ”
62749	62757	62758	62758	he	1325	“ So how do you know Logan ? ”
62762	62783	62812	62812	she	85	“ It ’s been a long time since he ’s brought a date to one of these sorts of things . ”
62784	62806	62908	62908	Brontë	85	“ We met under inauspicious circumstances , I ’m afraid . Did you hear about his trip to Seaturtle Cay resort ? ”
62886	62907	62908	62908	Brontë	85	“ I suppose we can credit Hurricane Latonya for bringing you both together , then . Logan seems happy enough . ”
62919	62923	62928	62928	Cade	80	“ Does he ? ”
62924	62927	62928	62928	Cade	80	“ Indeed . ”
62932	62968	62908	62908	Brontë	85	“ From what I ’ve heard , he has n’t been at work nearly as much since returning , and we were speculating as to why . It seems I ’ve found out the answer . ”
62969	62972	62973	62973	she	85	“ We ? ”
62980	62985	62908	62908	Brontë	85	“ Who is we ? ”
62986	63000	63005	63005	She	85	“ Logan ’s closest friends . Would you like to meet a few ? ”
63001	63004	63060	63060	She	85	“ Please . ”
63009	63059	63120	63120	she	85	“ Hunter ’s not here tonight . He never attends these sorts of functions . But he and Logan are very close . I ’m sure you ’ll meet him at some point . Griffin ’s over there , by the ice sculpture . The one with the glasses . ”
63111	63119	63134	63134	Cade	80	“ He seems . . . nice , ”
63123	63133	63134	63134	Cade	80	“ Oh , Griffin ? He ’s a snob , ”
63138	63183	63190	63190	she	85	“ His family ’s British aristocracy . Very old money . Grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth and a polo pony at the ready . He ’s extremely intelligent . Good guy , once you get to know him , though . ”
63184	63189	63190	63190	she	85	“ I ’m sure , ”
63197	63261	63322	63322	Brontë	85	“ He does n’t take kindly to strangers , though , which is why we ’re standing over here talking about him instead of introducing you . If you were on a committee or wanted to discuss funding for a university project , I imagine he ’d talk your ear off . Most of us run in fairly exclusive circles , you understand . ”
63299	63321	63396	63396	She	85	“ Reese is also here tonight . See the man to Griffin ’s left with the women hanging off of him ? ”
63406	63413	63380	63380	He	1338	“ I think I found him . ”
63414	63453	63463	63463	Brontë	85	“ Reese is a bit of a ladies ’ man , which is why we ’re standing way over here . If I take you over to Reese , Logan will probably charge over to protect his territory . ”
63472	63505	63506	63506	He	1341	“ And you ? Where do you fit into the picture ? You ’ve shown me the professor and the playboy . Where do you fit into all these neat little categories ? ”
63515	63579	63584	63584	her	85	“ I am a Lancelot at heart , I ’m afraid . I like nothing more than to be of service . You ’re looking at the world ’s largest Boy Scout . Show me an old lady who needs to cross the street , and I ’ll show you a man who will trip over his own two feet to assist her . ”
63587	63599	63600	63600	Cade	80	“ That ’s a rather interesting picture you paint of yourself . ”
63603	63619	63584	63584	her	85	“ I find that most people fit into basic archetypes if you think about it . ”
63620	63629	63641	63641	He	80	“ Oh ? Where do you see me ? ”
63630	63640	63641	63641	He	80	“ I do n’t know enough about you yet . ”
63648	63657	63666	63666	She	85	“ What do you do for a living ? ”
63677	63688	63694	63694	he	80	“ I ’m a waitress . Does that change things ? ”
63697	63719	63781	63782	a sweetheart	1343	“ I ’m still forming my opinion . You ’re definitely more of a Mary Ann than a Ginger , though . ”
63720	63739	63753	63753	he	80	“ Ca n’t argue with that . Unfortunately , it feels like this party is full of Gingers . ”
63740	63752	63753	63753	he	80	“ These sorts of shindigs always draw a lot of Gingers , ”
63757	63777	63832	63832	Cade	80	“ Luckily for me , I ’ve claimed the one Mary Ann in the bunch . Much better conversation . ”
63823	63831	63832	63832	Cade	80	“ And Logan ? What is he ? ”
63835	63852	63871	63871	He	80	“ He ’s the boss , of course . Just like everyone wishes they could be . ”
63853	63870	63871	63871	He	80	“ Mmm . ‘ He who owns a hundred sheep must fight with fifty wolves . ’ ”
63878	63883	63909	63909	he	80	“ Who said that ? ”
63905	63908	63909	63909	he	80	“ Plutarch , ”
63917	63950	63951	63951	She	85	“ And you ’re keeping Logan ’s new friend all to yourself tonight . I ’m wounded , especially when I come and find that she ’s quoting Greek philosophy to you . ”
63959	63964	63972	63972	Griffin	78	“ I ’m Brontë . ”
63965	63971	63981	63981	He	78	“ Of course you are , ”
63998	64006	64013	64013	she	85	“ Anne , Charlotte , or Emily ? ”
64007	64012	64058	64058	Cade	80	“ Take your pick , ”
64045	64057	64058	64058	Cade	80	“ I ’m chaperoning while Logan has to do the rounds , ”
64061	64086	64092	64092	Griffin	78	“ Brontë did n’t look as if she was enjoying the stock market conversation , so I was put in charge of her rescue . ”
64087	64091	64092	64092	Griffin	78	“ Wise choice , ”
64095	64110	64130	64130	she	85	“ So you quoted Plutarch . Are you a big fan of his work ? ”
64111	64129	64130	64130	she	85	“ Actually , I do n’t know that I am . While I enjoyed his Parallel Lives , ”
64142	64170	64171	64171	Cade	80	“ I find them rather biased toward his own particular philosophy , which is ironic considering that he castigated Herodotus for doing the same in his works . ”
64174	64212	64217	64217	she	85	“ And this is the part where both of you lose me . I think I ’m off to get a refill while you two discuss dead Greek guys . Would you like more wine , Brontë ? ”
64213	64216	64217	64217	she	85	“ Please , ”
64224	64230	64231	64231	Griffin	78	“ That would be lovely . ”
64241	64288	64293	64293	she	85	“ So how did Logan end up with a woman who quotes philosophy ? You ’ll forgive me if I say that most women he dates do n’t seem the type to be able to read anything beyond a fashion magazine , much less ancient history . ”
64289	64292	64231	64231	Griffin	78	“ Well , ”
64300	64312	64552	64552	He	80	“ We got stuck in an elevator together in a hurricane . ”
64564	64568	64754	64754	She	1362	“ next time , ”
64718	64724	64810	64810	She	1362	“ Well , hello there , ”
64822	64848	64863	64864	The woman	472	“ I was wondering if I ’d get a chance to talk to you . They ’re keeping you well guarded , are n’t they ? ”
64853	64862	64863	64864	The woman	472	“ What do you mean , well guarded ? ”
64869	64909	64913	64913	Brontë	85	“ His little friends . The band of billionaires or whatever they call themselves . Logan wants to make sure that you avoid people like me at this party , so he ’s assigned his buddies to shadow you . ”
64923	64937	64938	64939	The woman	472	“ You must be Danica . I was told you ’d be here . ”
64946	64955	64974	64974	Brontë	85	“ Not told by Logan , I imagine . ”
64967	64973	64980	64980	her	82	“ Nice necklace . Present ? ”
64983	65071	65130	65131	The woman	472	“ Did he tell you that we were engaged ? My guess is no . He ’s very closed off emotionally . I suppose you can blame his father for that . The elder Mr. Hawkings was a real asshole , but at some point , Logan has to take responsibility for himself . Not everything in life is a business transaction . Of course , Logan has n’t learned that lesson yet . He thinks everything has a price . The old man taught him that . ”
65143	65157	65130	65131	The woman	472	“ I take it that you and Logan are not on friendly terms ? ”
65162	65186	65119	65119	She	85	“ I wanted to be on friendly terms . Our breaking up was not my choice , you know . He dumped me . ”
65187	65190	65213	65213	Danica	82	“ Why ? ”
65220	65273	65346	65346	She	82	“ Logan likes for everyone to stay in the neat little box he ’s created for them . If you try to escape the box , he ’ll try to push you back into it . And if that does n’t work , he ’s done with you . He ’s ruthless . ”
65289	65345	65346	65346	She	82	“ He wanted me to be the perfect little stay - at - home wifey . My schedule did n’t matter as long as I was available for him . And when I tried to have a life outside of him , or to assert my freedom , he cut me off at the knees . ”
65349	65390	65413	65413	Danica	82	“ The next thing I knew , I was being removed from the apartment we shared and all of my belongings were put into storage . He did n’t even give me a warning before tossing me into the trash . ”
65423	65431	65432	65432	Danica	82	“ Why are you telling me this ? ”
65444	65469	65432	65432	Danica	82	“ Because you look like a nice girl . And you ’re out of your depth with Logan . You ’re just his type . ”
65470	65474	65635	65635	Brontë	85	“ I am ? ”
65475	65634	65704	65704	Brontë	85	“ Of course . You look soft and just a little bit shy . Intimidated . That ’s the kind Logan likes , you know . He plucks a girl out of nowhere and molds her into the woman he wants at his side . If you do n’t have a life , that makes it perfect for him , because he needs you available at his beck and call . He ’s a great guy . . . for a time . He ’ll make you the happiest woman on earth until you cross him . And if you try to be independent , be ready for him to send you packing . I do n’t want you to be caught off guard like I was . I thought I loved him and he loved me . It turns out that he does n’t know how to love . He just knows how to succeed at business . ”
65696	65703	65704	65704	Brontë	85	“ Logan ’s not like that , ”
65707	65720	65721	65721	Brontë	85	“ Is n’t he ? Have you told him you love him ? ”
65725	65744	65745	65745	She	285	“ Try it . See how he responds . That ’ll tell you everything you need to know . ”
65755	65782	65790	65790	she	285	“ I did , and he totally ignored me . Logan does n’t know how to love . All he knows is how to make money . ”
65783	65789	65790	65790	she	285	“ Thanks for the warning , ”
65794	65821	65847	65847	She	82	“ I ’m sorry I had to be the bearer of bad news . But it ’s best if you ’re prepared for the eventual heartbreak . ”
65831	65846	66248	66248	he	75	“ And if anyone asks , we did n’t have this conversation , understand ? ”
66254	66261	66269	66269	she	85	“ It ’s cold out here . ”
66262	66268	66273	66273	He	75	“ I had n’t noticed , ”
66285	66291	66292	66292	She	85	“ Is everything all right ? ”
66298	66329	66330	66330	Logan	75	“ Yes . It just got to be a bit too much , and I drank more than I should have . I thought this would help clear my head . ”
66347	66366	66367	66367	She	85	“ Would you like to go home ? I ’d love to peel this dress off of you . ”
66379	66386	66415	66415	She	85	“ That sounds good to me . ”
66387	66414	66441	66441	her	85	“ If there were n’t two hundred people in the other room , I ’d bend you over the balcony and make you mine right now . ”
66444	66447	66505	66505	She	85	“ Logan . ”
66448	66504	66505	66505	She	85	“ You ’re lovely in that dress , Brontë , but I ca n’t wait to see you out of it . Every man here is jealous that you ’re going home with me tonight . Your smile and your laugh are so charming that half the room turned around every time they heard you . ”
66512	66520	66539	66539	Her	85	“ I think that ’s your imagination . ”
66521	66538	66568	66568	They	1390	“ It ’s true . Why do you think I asked Cade to keep you company ? ”
66554	66567	66632	66632	he	75	“ I suppose . Let ’s go home . I ’m tired . ”
66624	66631	66648	66648	She	85	“ Did you enjoy the party ? ”
66660	66665	66666	66666	He	75	“ I met Danica . ”
66671	66674	66696	66696	his	75	“ Oh ? ”
66675	66692	66699	66699	Brontë	85	“ She wanted to warn me about you . And how you treat everything like business . ”
66705	66718	66751	66751	He	75	“ When were you going to tell me you had been engaged ? ”
66719	66750	66751	66751	He	75	“ I did n’t think it was important . We were only engaged for a day or two . Never set a date . It was over two years ago . ”
66758	66768	66797	66797	He	75	“ Apparently she ’s still quite upset over it . ”
66769	66796	66815	66815	she	85	“ She tried to warn me off of you . Said you ’d dump me like so much trash the moment you got tired of me . ”
66831	66841	66858	66858	she	85	“ You know that ’s not true , Brontë . ”
66842	66857	66888	66888	she	82	“ I suspect she told me a lot of things that were n’t true , ”
66907	66915	66957	66957	Brontë	85	“ Why did you two break up ? ”
66916	66956	67002	67002	He	75	“ I had my suspicions that Danica was with me for my money and not for me . I asked her to sign a prenuptial agreement . She refused , and that told me everything I needed to know . ”
66983	67001	67002	67002	He	75	“ She told me that she was trying to be independent and you did n’t like that . ”
67009	67050	67062	67062	she	85	“ Danica ’s version of independent was going on vacation with her friends without me . Repeatedly , and on my dime . When I suggested we take a trip together , she accused me of trying to smother her . ”
67051	67061	67065	67065	Logan	75	“ Boy , she sounds like a real winner , ”
67073	67111	67118	67118	she	85	“ She ’s nothing like you , if that ’s what you ’re worried about . And our relationship is nothing like the one I had with her . Do n’t let her lies get to you . ”
67112	67117	67118	67118	she	85	“ I wo n’t , ”
67139	67147	67212	67212	His	75	“ But you should have told me . ”
67185	67211	67212	67212	His	75	“ Trust me when I say she is not in my life anymore . Has n’t been for some time . There ’s only you . ”
67230	67234	67269	67269	He	75	“ Only you . ”
67261	67268	67269	67269	He	75	“ I want you , Logan . ”
67276	67292	67377	67377	she	85	“ As soon as we get home , I ’m making you mine , Brontë . ”
67383	67402	67453	67453	Logan	75	“ I do n’t want to wait until we get home , Logan . I want you now . ”
67444	67452	67460	67460	his	75	“ I do n’t want to wait . ”
67467	67477	67486	67486	she	85	“ I do n’t have a condom , Brontë . ”
67478	67485	67495	67495	her	85	“ I ’m on the pill , ”
67506	67515	67555	67555	he	75	“ Please , Logan . Take me now . ”
67549	67554	67555	67555	he	75	“ Ah , Brontë , ”
67558	67572	67906	67906	she	85	“ Your skin feels like silk . Wet and ready for me already ? ”
67900	67905	67964	67964	Logan	75	“ I love you , ”
67952	67963	67973	67973	He	75	“ This meeting of the brotherhood is called to order , ”
67985	67988	68453	68453	he	80	“ Deal . ”
68446	68452	68453	68453	he	80	“ Sorry I ’m late , ”
68456	68468	68476	68476	Logan	75	“ Hold up at the office . Someone deal me in ? ”
68469	68475	68476	68476	Logan	75	“ ’ Bout fucking time , ”
68492	68498	68531	68531	he	76	“ We can start now . ”
68541	68550	68561	68561	Griffin	78	“ I enjoyed meeting Brontë the other day . ”
68556	68560	68561	68561	Griffin	78	“ Charming girl , ”
68575	68592	68600	68600	he	78	“ Very interesting education . She ’s a step up from your normal airheads , Logan . ”
68593	68599	68600	68600	he	78	“ She ’s a waitress , ”
68603	68612	68622	68622	he	77	“ Do n’t get too attached to her . ”
68630	68641	68647	68647	Cade	80	“ What does her job have to do with anything ? ”
68655	68673	68683	68683	Hunter	76	“ She ’s not another Danica . You do n’t know that she ’s after your money . ”
68674	68682	68706	68706	Logan	75	“ He does n’t not know it , ”
68694	68705	68720	68720	Reese	77	“ Do we have to talk about this right now ? ”
68709	68719	68720	68720	Reese	77	“ Well , clearly it ’s affecting your mood , ”
68724	68751	68757	68757	He	75	“ Is the problem that she ’s a waitress or that you like her enough that you ’re worried you ’re being taken for a ride ? ”
68775	68782	68809	68809	He	75	“ She ’s not like Danica . ”
68783	68808	68856	68856	Reese	77	“ No ? She ’s female , is n’t she ? That means she ’s interested in your wallet . Face facts , Logan . ”
68831	68855	68856	68856	Reese	77	“ Well , if she ’s just a fly - by - night , let me know when you ’re done with her , ”
68859	68872	68927	68927	Cade	80	“ Because I saw her ass in that little red dress and — ”
68940	68957	68964	68964	Logan	75	“ No fighting during a meeting , remember ? Do we need to take this outside ? ”
68958	68963	69034	69034	he	76	“ I ’m fine , ”
69030	69033	69034	69034	he	76	“ Come , ”
69037	69046	69047	69047	He	76	“ Let ’s go walk for a bit . ”
69054	69066	69138	69140	The scarred man	225	“ Play on . Logan and I will be back shortly . ”
69172	69186	69194	69194	Logan	75	“ So . You do realize that Reese was just busting your balls ? ”
69187	69193	69228	69228	Logan	75	“ I realize that now , ”
69203	69227	69306	69306	Hunter	76	“ I ’ve never seen you this stressed over a woman . Even Danica , and we both know she left her mark . ”
69293	69305	69306	69306	Hunter	76	“ I agree with Cade , for what it ’s worth , ”
69310	69353	69406	69406	her	85	“ She does n’t sound like Danica . Griffin likes her . Griffin does n’t like anyone . He says that Brontë ’s very intelligent and can hold a conversation . How many of your supermodels has Griffin ever said that about ? ”
69354	69367	69379	69379	Hunter	76	“ I bought her a necklace . She did n’t want it . ”
69368	69378	69474	69474	he	75	“ But she accepted it , did n’t she ? ”
69465	69473	69484	69485	his friend	927	“ I need to know for sure , ”
69478	69483	69484	69485	his friend	927	“ Then test her , ”
69488	69498	69886	69886	her	85	“ It ’s the only way to be sure . ”
69890	69900	69914	69914	He	75	“ You ’re home early , are n’t you ? ”
69901	69913	69984	69984	Logan	75	“ I am . I canceled the rest of my meetings . ”
69995	70003	70024	70024	her	85	“ I have a present for you . ”
70027	70032	70035	70035	himself	75	“ Present ? Why ? ”
70047	70059	70073	70073	she	85	“ No reason . I just wanted to give you something . ”
70060	70071	70089	70089	She	85	“ You ’ve already given me enough stuff , Logan . ”
70102	70107	70145	70145	Brontë	85	“ What ’s this ? ”
70108	70144	70145	70145	Brontë	85	“ It ’s the paperwork for the diner . There ’s three of them , actually . One in Kansas City , and the other two are in Dallas and Atlanta . They ’re yours . ”
70160	70163	70164	70164	Her	85	“ Why ? ”
70172	70180	70145	70145	Brontë	85	“ What do you mean , why ? ”
70181	70196	70253	70253	She	85	“ I mean , why give me a diner ? What ’s the point ? ”
70197	70252	70264	70264	her	85	“ It ’s a gift . Income . You can live off of the profits , if you want , or you can work on improving the chain . I ’ve set up a meeting with the consultant so he can go over what he ’s learned so far and suggest improvements . You — ”
70270	70278	70287	70287	he	75	“ Logan , I do n’t understand . ”
70279	70286	70287	70287	he	75	“ It ’s an expensive gift , ”
70297	70305	70264	70264	her	85	“ Most people would say thank you . ”
70306	70323	70334	70334	She	85	“ I guess I ’m confused . Why do you think I ’d want the diner ? ”
70324	70333	70334	70334	She	85	“ So you can make something of yourself . ”
70337	70351	70358	70358	Logan	75	“ You mean , so I can be something other than a waitress ? ”
70352	70357	70367	70367	Brontë	85	“ Something like that , ”
70373	70378	70397	70397	her	85	“ Keep the diner . ”
70405	70412	70487	70487	he	75	“ You do n’t want it ? ”
70480	70486	70505	70505	Brontë	85	“ Where are you going ? ”
70492	70504	70508	70508	her	85	“ You said I could stay as long as I wanted , ”
70512	70526	70508	70508	her	85	“ This is as long as I want . I ’m done here . ”
70527	70547	70548	70548	You	75	“ Why ? His voice was harsh . Anger rocketed through him . This was completely irrational of her . “
70560	70561	70548	70548	You	75	” “
70564	70573	70600	70600	you	75	” she cried , turning to face him . “
70613	70614	70629	70629	you	75	” “
70624	70625	70644	70644	Brontë	85	” “
70636	70643	70644	70644	Brontë	85	” Her eyes shimmered with tears . “
70646	70678	70688	70688	I	0	” he said , his voice soft . He moved to draw her into his arms , but she stiffened and pulled away . He ’d made a mistake , then . “
70695	70696	70704	70704	I	0	” “
70711	70712	70704	70704	I	0	” “
70718	70722	70704	70704	I	0	” he confessed . “
70726	70735	70761	70761	You	75	” Her voice rose an octave in response . “
70744	70755	70776	70776	You	75	” He remained silent at that . Her eyes widened . “
70787	70793	70776	70776	You	75	” Logan ’s jaw tightened . “
70800	70801	70776	70776	You	75	” “
70808	70813	70822	70822	You	75	” she said bitterly . “
70820	70821	70822	70822	You	75	” “
70826	70831	70883	70883	Brontë	85	” she bit out . “
70875	70876	70892	70892	You	75	” “
70890	70891	70892	70892	You	75	” “
70898	70908	70917	70917	Danica	82	” she said , viciously slamming her suitcase shut . “
70921	70922	70937	70937	She	82	” “
70933	70934	70977	70977	she	82	” “
70959	70973	70977	70977	she	82	” Tears spilled down her cheeks , driving a knife into his gut . “
70983	71022	71030	71030	yours	75	” She moved to the dresser and pulled out a blue velvet case — the necklace case . She looked at it and her lip curled , almost in disgust , and she held it out to him . “
71026	71027	71030	71030	yours	75	” “
71032	71038	71055	71055	you	75	” Brontë shook her head . “
71061	71096	71055	71055	you	75	” When she held it out again and he did n’t reach for it , she tossed it on the bed as if it were garbage and pulled out the handle of her suitcase . “
71099	71111	71112	71112	We	1449	” he said , trying to take the suitcase from her . “
71119	71120	71135	71135	We	1449	” “
71123	71134	71151	71151	Logan	75	” she said , and her voice broke a little . “
71153	71171	71151	71151	Logan	75	” She pushed past him and headed out the front door , rolling the suitcase behind her . “
71174	71175	71151	71151	Logan	75	” “
71178	71182	71189	71189	Logan	75	” she repeated . “
71191	71355	71954	71954	she	85	” And she turned and left . He watched her go , his mind seething with turmoil . She was n’t willing to listen to reason right now . She was furious — and she had every right to be , he supposed — but he was n’t going to give up . Somehow , he ’d get her to talk to him again . He ’d explain his side of the story , and then they ’d hash things out . Kiss and make up . And then he could tell her he loved her like he should have — with no strings attached . He went back to the room she ’d emptied and stared at the discarded necklace box . I told you did n’t want it , and you pushed it on me . It seemed like he ’d pushed and pushed until she ’d finally broken . Damn it . There had to be a way to fix this .
71948	71953	72013	72017	the woman on the line	1482	“ Adventure is worthwhile , ”
72008	72012	72013	72017	the woman on the line	1482	“ Audrey Petty , ”
72021	72030	72035	72037	The other woman	285	“ Audrey ? It ’s me , Brontë . ”
72031	72034	72035	72037	The other woman	285	“ Brontë ? ”
72044	72051	72061	72061	Brontë	85	“ Why are you calling me ? ”
72052	72060	72061	72061	Brontë	85	“ I need a place to stay , ”
72071	72077	72252	72252	Audrey	125	“ I ’ve left Logan . ”
72244	72251	72252	72252	Audrey	125	“ You . . . huh ? ”
72255	72271	72252	72252	Audrey	125	“ Wait . You left him , and you ’re calling me ? His assistant ? ”
72279	72291	72296	72296	Audrey	125	“ You ’re the only person I know in this town . ”
72292	72295	72301	72301	she	125	“ Oh . ”
72313	72318	72252	72252	Audrey	125	“ Where are you ? ”
72319	72323	72301	72301	she	125	“ The subway . ”
72324	72330	72252	72252	Audrey	125	“ Yes , but where ? ”
72371	72385	72448	72449	The violinist	1489	“ I honestly have no idea . It ’s by Logan ’s building . ”
72386	72418	72425	72425	she	125	“ Okay . I ’m pretty sure I can guess what station that is . Just wait there , and I ’ll swing by to get you . We ’ll talk . ”
72419	72424	72425	72425	she	125	“ Thanks , Audrey , ”
72429	72434	72440	72441	the assistant	1262	“ I appreciate it . ”
72435	72439	72622	72622	Brontë	85	“ You bet , ”
72628	72633	72638	72638	she	125	“ Hi , Audrey . ”
72634	72637	72638	72638	she	125	“ Hi , ”
72651	72656	72660	72660	she	125	“ You look rough . ”
72663	72674	72679	72679	Audrey	125	“ I do n’t seem to be taking this well . ”
72675	72678	72679	72679	Audrey	125	“ No , ”
72686	72738	72739	72739	Brontë	85	“ I do n’t think you are . I suppose I should be offering you condolences , but I ’m mostly just mystified . You broke it off with him ? Are you aware he ’s a billionaire ? A really good - looking one ? Was it truly that bad ? ”
72744	72753	72739	72739	Brontë	85	“ He tried to give me a business . ”
72758	72769	72815	72815	She	85	“ So I could ‘ make something ’ of myself . ”
72770	72773	72739	72739	Brontë	85	“ Ouch . ”
72774	72787	72815	72815	She	85	“ I told him I loved him , and he ignored it . ”
72788	72814	72815	72815	She	85	“ Double ouch . Okay , I can see why the lure of his money palls a bit in the face of his emotional assholeness . ”
72823	72839	72846	72846	She	85	“ Did you want to go grab a coffee and talk this out or something ? ”
72840	72845	72846	72846	She	85	“ I guess so . ”
72854	72865	72880	72880	Brontë	85	“ Then I guess I have to find a hotel . ”
72866	72879	72889	72889	Audrey	125	“ You do know how much most hotels in this area cost ? ”
72892	72952	72958	72958	Brontë	85	“ Brontë , listen . I really like you and I would love to offer my couch , but if Logan found out , he ’d have kittens . So I do n’t mind shepherding you somewhere as a Good Samaritan , but I ca n’t take sides in this . You know whose side I have to take . ”
72953	72957	72982	72983	The assistant	1262	“ I know , ”
72962	72981	72992	72992	She	85	“ I really appreciate the help , Audrey . I did n’t want to get you in trouble . ”
72986	72991	72992	72992	She	85	“ However . . . ”
72997	73013	73022	73022	Brontë	85	“ I know someone who needs a roomie . Were you planning on staying long ? ”
73014	73021	73025	73025	She	85	“ I had n’t really decided , ”
73037	73052	73058	73058	she	85	“ I would n’t mind taking a few days off to clear my head . ”
73061	73104	73112	73112	Audrey	125	“ Well , if you volunteer to pay half of this month ’s rent , I imagine you can stay with her a couple of weeks . I guarantee it ’ll end up being cheaper than a few nights in a hotel . ”
73105	73111	73112	73112	Audrey	125	“ Who is this person ? ”
73116	73128	73215	73215	She	85	“ My sister , Gretchen . Want me to call her ? ”
73220	73230	73258	73258	Brontë	85	“ Can you find out if it ’s available ? ”
73252	73257	73282	73282	she	85	“ Such a cliché . ”
73290	73302	73258	73258	Brontë	85	“ I do n’t understand . Why is it a cliché ? ”
73303	73314	73258	73258	Brontë	85	“ SoHo ’s where all the artists used to live . ”
73317	73326	73336	73336	Audrey	125	“ Is your sister an artist , then ? ”
73327	73335	73336	73336	Audrey	125	“ She likes to imagine she is , ”
73342	73357	73368	73368	Audrey	125	“ Artistic temperament , yes . Artist , no . She ’s a ghostwriter . ”
73358	73367	73368	73368	Audrey	125	“ Oh , wow . That ’s fascinating . ”
73371	73399	73407	73407	she	125	“ Some days she seems to like it . Some days she seems to hate it . I suppose it depends on who she ’s working with . ”
73415	73420	73432	73432	Audrey	125	“ This is us . ”
73443	73448	73407	73407	she	125	“ Who is it ? ”
73449	73464	73579	73581	The other woman	285	“ It ’s your sister . Open up . I got you a roomie . ”
73569	73578	73592	73592	Audrey	125	“ How ’d you find me a roommate ? ”
73607	73621	73622	73622	Gretchen	129	“ Brontë , this is my sister , Gretchen . Gretchen , Brontë . ”
73630	73638	73645	73645	she	129	“ Bronty like . . . brontosaurus ? ”
73639	73644	73645	73645	she	129	“ Like Charlotte Brontë , ”
73648	73660	73703	73703	she	129	“ I knew that . I was just fucking with you . ”
73729	73746	73768	73768	Gretchen	129	“ So you want to be my roomie ? You have n’t even seen the place . ”
73747	73767	73768	73768	Gretchen	129	“ Brontë here just broke up with her boyfriend and needs a place to stay for a few weeks . ”
73777	73789	73827	73827	Gretchen	129	“ I need a permanent roommate , not a temporary one . ”
73790	73826	73833	73833	she	129	“ Yes , but Brontë ’s willing to pay half of the rent this month , and she ca n’t stay with me because the boyfriend she broke up with happens to be my boss . ”
73842	73848	73854	73854	Brontë	85	“ Is n’t he rich ? ”
73849	73853	73854	73854	Brontë	85	“ Too rich , ”
73858	73868	73869	73870	The writer	1511	“ He ’s let it go to his head . ”
73876	73889	73936	73936	Brontë	85	“ Huh . Well , come take a look at the place . ”
73944	73949	73954	73954	Gretchen	129	“ How many bedrooms ? ”
73950	73953	73954	73954	Gretchen	129	“ Two , ”
73970	73977	74022	74022	she	129	“ It ’s not very big . ”
74015	74021	74052	74052	Gretchen	129	“ Looks good to me , ”
74025	74051	74052	74052	Gretchen	129	“ I probably will only be staying until the end of the month , though . I still have an apartment back in Kansas City . ”
74055	74077	74022	74022	she	129	“ I wo n’t take down my want ads , then . I do have to warn you about one thing . ”
74078	74081	74052	74052	Gretchen	129	“ Oh ? ”
74082	74093	74100	74100	Audrey	125	“ I have a pet . His name is Igor . ”
74094	74099	74100	74100	Audrey	125	“ He ’s hideous , ”
74104	74109	74143	74143	Igor	139	“ He is not ! ”
74135	74142	74232	74232	Gretchen	129	“ He ’s just a cat . ”
74217	74231	74232	74232	Gretchen	129	“ Well , that ’s a better reaction than the last potential roomie , ”
74235	74239	74903	74903	Brontë	85	“ Welcome aboard . ”
74896	74902	74903	74903	Brontë	85	“ Headed out this morning ? ”
74910	74913	74931	74931	Brontë	85	“ Yup . ”
74925	74930	74931	74931	Brontë	85	“ Off to work . ”
74940	74951	74978	74978	Brontë	85	“ Work ? But I thought you were a ghostwriter . ”
74952	74977	74978	74978	Brontë	85	“ I am . I have a friend who owns a coffee shop . I barista to supplement my income and help him out . ”
74981	74998	75016	75016	Igor	139	“ I wish your friend was hiring . I would n’t mind supplementing my own income . ”
75030	75060	75074	75076	The other woman	285	“ He ’s always hiring . I have to warn you , though , he pays me off the books . He ’d probably do the same for you . ”
75061	75073	75074	75076	The other woman	285	“ I do n’t mind . I need something to do . ”
75083	75095	75016	75016	Igor	139	“ Trying to get your mind off your ex , huh ? ”
75096	75102	75111	75111	Gretchen	129	“ Am I that obvious ? ”
75103	75110	75111	75111	Gretchen	129	“ No , of course not , ”
75114	75144	75145	75145	Brontë	85	“ I ’m pretty good at figuring people out . Like I figured that since your eyes were all red and puffy from crying , you probably missed him . ”
75152	75175	75111	75111	Gretchen	129	“ Gotcha . At any rate , if you ’d like the company , I could use the money and the distraction . ”
75176	75196	75145	75145	Brontë	85	“ Of course . Cooper’d love to have you . Do you have a white shirt to work in ? ”
75197	75202	75222	75222	he	75	“ I think so . ”
75241	75252	75624	75624	Logan	75	“ Give me ten minutes and I ’ll get dressed . ”
75631	75635	75624	75624	Logan	75	“ Any leads ? ”
75636	75669	75740	75740	Brontë	85	“ Nothing . No tickets purchased at the airport . If she ’s gone back to Kansas City , she has n’t flown . Maybe she hitched a ride with a friend . ”
75728	75739	75750	75750	she	85	“ I am ready for the day to be over , ”
75760	75768	75769	75769	Gretchen	129	“ How ’s our tip jar looking ? ”
75781	75803	75809	75809	Brontë	85	“ Fat enough to order a pizza tonight . We could watch some total chick movies . You in the mood ? ”
75804	75808	75809	75809	Brontë	85	“ I am , ”
75815	75829	75836	75836	Gretchen	129	“ As long as it ’s not Pretty Woman . Something New Yorky . ”
75830	75835	75839	75839	Brontë	85	“ Maid in Manhattan ? ”
75845	75849	75855	75855	Cooper	143	“ Very funny . ”
75850	75853	75855	75855	Cooper	143	“ Cloverfield ? ”
75857	75870	75881	75881	Gretchen	129	“ I have it on DVD . I could bring it over . ”
75871	75880	75881	75881	Gretchen	129	“ Not exactly a chick flick , Cooper , ”
75892	75901	76000	76000	Gretchen	129	“ And you ’re not exactly a chick . ”
75994	75999	76000	76000	Gretchen	129	“ How about 300 ? ”
76014	76050	76057	76057	Brontë	85	“ That ’s practically a chick flick , considering it ’s filled with oiled - up beefcake . It ’s not New Yorky , but with all that man - meat , does it matter ? ”
76051	76056	76057	76057	Brontë	85	“ Works for me , ”
76060	76066	76067	76067	Gretchen	129	“ Want to invite Audrey ? ”
76072	76089	76094	76094	Brontë	85	“ She ca n’t . A certain someone is keeping her busy on a secret project . ”
76090	76093	76115	76116	The redhead	1561	“ Oh ? ”
76108	76114	76115	76116	The redhead	1561	“ What sort of project ? ”
76127	76130	76177	76177	She	129	“ Gretchen ? ”
76131	76176	76177	76177	She	129	“ Do n’t get too excited . It ’s just business reports . Apparently her boss is skipping a lot of meetings lately , so she has to listen to recordings and recap them for him so he does n’t miss out on anything . ”
76184	76193	76200	76200	Brontë	85	“ Do n’t read too much into that . ”
76194	76199	76221	76221	She	129	“ I wo n’t , ”
76232	76239	76246	76246	Gretchen	129	“ So , a movie tonight ? ”
76240	76245	76246	76246	Gretchen	129	“ Mmm - hmm , ”
76249	76262	76221	76221	She	129	“ I want to stop somewhere first and pick up a donation . ”
76263	76266	76221	76221	She	129	“ Donation ? ”
76267	76285	76297	76297	Gretchen	129	“ Yeah . I pick up used books and take them in to a local retirement home . ”
76286	76296	76297	76297	Gretchen	129	“ Oh , Gretchen , that ’s so sweet . ”
76307	76382	76383	76383	Brontë	85	“ Not so sweet . I started doing it when I kept getting so many author copies of my ghostwritten books . I did n’t want them , so I donated them to my nana ’s nursing home . I did n’t realize when I first went that so few of the elderly get out , so I bring them books . I ca n’t imagine sitting around all day staring at the wall . ”
76386	76407	76537	76537	Brontë	85	“ Well , if it makes you feel any better , I love the idea and I want to help . ”
76408	76461	76471	76471	Brontë	85	“ Good , because Audrey bailed on me . She ’s working late , which means you and I get to go and pick up a few boxes from an estate sale . Someone told her there were two boxes to pick up and she volunteered us to go in her place . ”
76481	76491	76504	76504	Brontë	85	“ Your sister ’s very dedicated to her job . ”
76492	76503	76504	76504	Brontë	85	“ Eh . She likes working for that soulless bastard . ”
76514	76522	76534	76534	Gretchen	129	“ He ’s not a soulless bastard . ”
76523	76533	76785	76785	Brontë	85	“ Says the now proud owner of a diner , ”
76757	76784	76785	76785	Brontë	85	“ I have the address for Audrey ’s pickup . You ready to haul some books a few blocks ? She says it ’s two boxes . ”
76792	76795	76785	76785	Brontë	85	“ Ready . ”
76796	76818	77239	77243	A soft , pleasant female	1598	“ Let ’s go , then . The place should be empty . Audrey says the key ’s under the mat . ”
77232	77238	77239	77243	A soft , pleasant female	1598	“ What is this place ? ”
77247	77252	77268	77270	The other woman	285	“ It ’s lovely . ”
77253	77267	77281	77281	her	285	“ Some dead celebrity ’s home or something . I do n’t care . ”
77286	77312	77321	77322	The women	1303	“ All I care about is how we ’re supposed to get these damned boxes back to SoHo . What the heck was Audrey thinking ? ”
77313	77320	77427	77428	the redhead	1561	“ Could we call a cab ? ”
77417	77426	77427	77428	the redhead	1561	“ I do n’t know about a cab , ”
77431	77447	77452	77456	the dark - haired one	1607	“ That ’ll clean us out , and I still want to order that pizza . ”
77448	77451	77463	77464	the redhead	1561	“ So ? ”
77459	77462	77484	77485	the redhead	1561	“ Brontë , ”
77490	77508	77463	77464	the redhead	1561	“ You have to understand something about my sister . She ’s not the most practical creature . ”
77509	77520	77572	77572	She	1561	“ She ’s not ? She seems practical to me . ”
77521	77571	77585	77585	she	1561	“ Not when it comes to work . She thinks we ’re mules or something , as evidenced by all this . And if I need to call and gripe at her to get her in line , then , by golly , I ’m going to do it . ”
77591	77621	77630	77631	the brunette	1610	“ Voice mail . I ca n’t believe her . She said there were two boxes . Not five boxes of hardbacks . Does she think we ’re bodybuilders ? ”
77622	77629	77630	77631	the brunette	1610	“ It ’s not that bad , ”
77642	77650	77658	77659	the redhead	1561	“ I ’m sure we can manage . ”
77651	77657	77658	77659	the redhead	1561	“ I blame Logan Hawkings , ”
77667	77681	77658	77659	the redhead	1561	“ He thinks the world just belongs to him , does n’t he ? ”
77693	77697	77722	77723	The brunette	1610	“ I suppose . ”
77698	77721	77722	77723	The brunette	1610	“ Ugh . Look at that hang - dog expression . You ’re still in love with him , are n’t you ? ”
77731	77763	77791	77792	The redhead	1561	“ ‘ I hate and I love . Perhaps you ask why I do so . I do not know , but I feel it , and am in agony . ’ ”
77764	77790	77850	77852	Smart . Annoyed	146	“ Oh , quit quoting that crap at me . You ’re being dramatic . He ’s a jerk . You ’ll get over him . ”
77854	77887	77897	77900	the one called Brontë	1616	“ Save me from rich , attractive alpha males . They think they ’re the heroes from a fairy tale . Little do they know , they ’re more like the villains . ”
77888	77896	77910	77910	Gretchen	129	“ That ’s not fair , Gretchen , ”
77903	77909	77945	77945	She	129	“ Life ’s not fair , ”
77918	77944	77945	77945	She	129	“ I ’d rather have a man who is n’t in love with his own reflection than one who needs hair product or designer labels . ”
77969	77993	77998	77998	Gretchen	129	“ So you ’d rather have a pizza guy with a weak chin and a knight - in - shining - armor complex ? ”
77994	77997	78026	78026	she	129	“ Yes , ”
78012	78024	78319	78319	Logan	75	“ His looks are n’t half as important as his brain . ”
78313	78318	78319	78319	Logan	75	“ What is it ? ”
78322	78332	78353	78353	Hunter	76	“ I ’m about to head into a meeting . ”
78333	78352	78373	78373	Logan	75	“ There ca n’t be more than one ‘ Brontë ’ running around New York , can there ? ”
78369	78372	78373	78373	Logan	75	“ Brontë ? ”
78379	78388	78409	78409	they	1303	“ You saw her ? Where is she ? ”
78413	78431	78438	78438	Logan	75	“ She just left with a redhead named Gretchen . I want to know more about her . ”
78432	78437	78438	78438	Logan	75	“ About my Brontë ? ”
78445	78460	78409	78409	they	1303	“ No . Gretchen . The one with red hair . I want her . ”
78461	78464	78409	78409	they	1303	“ Oh . ”
78469	78495	78496	78496	Logan	75	“ Sorry , man . Have n’t been myself lately . She left me , and I ’ve been going crazy trying to find her . ”
78504	78520	78532	78532	Hunter	76	“ I ca n’t believe she ’s still in New York . Where are you ? ”
78521	78531	78607	78607	Hunter	76	“ At the townhouse on the Upper East Side . ”
78593	78606	78607	78607	Hunter	76	“ Your assistant did n’t come by to pick up the boxes , ”
78613	78625	78633	78633	Logan	75	“ This Gretchen did , and your Brontë was with her . ”
78626	78632	78633	78633	Logan	75	“ I have to go , ”
78636	78648	78659	78659	Hunter	76	“ I ’ll call Audrey and see who she sent over . ”
78649	78658	78675	78675	Logan	75	“ Send me information about this Gretchen woman , ”
78667	78674	78675	78675	Logan	75	“ I will . And thanks . ”
78685	78691	78697	78697	Hunter	76	“ I owe you one . ”
78692	78696	78697	78697	Hunter	76	“ You do , ”
78700	78716	78766	78766	Cooper	143	“ Just get me information on her friend , and we ’ll call it even . ”
78756	78765	78788	78788	she	85	“ I have good news and bad news , ”
78795	78798	78812	78812	Gretchen	129	“ Oh ? ”
78799	78811	78833	78833	Cooper	143	“ Hit us with the good news first , of course , ”
78815	78832	78833	78833	Cooper	143	“ No sense in bumming us out until you give us a bit of a lift . ”
78845	78858	78868	78868	Gretchen	129	“ I can now afford to put you both on the payroll . ”
78859	78867	78892	78892	Gretchen	129	“ So what ’s the bad news ? ”
78876	78891	78892	78892	Gretchen	129	“ There ’s a new boss . I have someone I ’m answering to . ”
78895	78901	78944	78944	him	1638	“ I do n’t understand . ”
78917	78923	78944	78944	him	1638	“ I sold the place . ”
78924	78938	78944	78944	him	1638	“ Holy cow ! I did n’t even know it was for sale . ”
78946	78952	78944	78944	him	1638	“ Congrats , I think ? ”
78953	78976	79049	79049	His	75	“ It was n’t up for sale officially , but someone approached me and made me an offer I ca n’t refuse . ”
79045	79048	79049	79049	His	75	“ Brontë . ”
79065	79074	79075	79075	His	75	“ What are you doing here , Logan ? ”
79086	79092	79096	79097	This man	1175	“ I own the place . ”
79105	79111	79119	79119	He	75	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
79112	79118	79162	79162	God	93	“ We need to talk . ”
79169	79179	79195	79195	His	75	“ I do n’t want to talk to you . ”
79180	79194	79210	79210	He	75	“ Allow me to rephrase that . I need to talk to you . ”
79233	79238	79210	79210	He	75	“ Please , Brontë . ”
79245	79247	79305	79305	she	129	“ please ”
79313	79323	79333	79333	Cooper	143	“ Can you give us a minute to talk ? ”
79327	79332	79360	79360	Gretchen	129	“ Use my office , ”
79369	79379	79387	79387	she	129	“ Are you sure this is wise , Brontë ? ”
79380	79386	79436	79436	Gretchen	129	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
79425	79435	79571	79571	His	75	“ We ’re right outside if you need us , ”
79583	79601	79651	79651	His	75	“ Is everything okay ? You ’re doing all right ? I ’ve been worried about you . ”
79629	79643	79651	79651	His	75	“ I ’m fine , Logan . I can take care of myself . ”
79644	79650	79651	79651	His	75	“ I know you can . ”
79660	79681	79718	79718	she	85	“ I was just worried when you did n’t return to Kansas City . No one knew where you were . ”
79725	79742	79776	79776	his	75	“ I decided to extend my vacation a little longer . Take a mental health break . ”
79743	79749	79797	79797	She	85	“ I want you back . ”
79808	79848	79913	79913	Logan	75	“ I ’m not going back to you , Logan . You do n’t want me . You want a girl who is n’t a waitress and who knows which salad fork to use . That ’s not me . ”
79849	79912	79922	79922	his	75	“ I do n’t care about that . I want you . When you left , it felt like the lights went out . I do n’t care if you eat with the wrong fork at every meal . I do n’t care if you waitress for the rest of your life . I just want you at my side , Brontë . ”
79939	79976	79977	79977	His	75	“ I miss you . I miss your smile . I miss your hand in mine . I miss your laugh when you ’re nervous . I wish to God I was hearing it right now . ”
79985	80005	80018	80018	she	1650	“ That hurricane was the best thing that ever happened to me because it brought you into my life . ”
80030	80053	80138	80138	His	75	“ If I ’m so great , why did you tell me you wanted me to ‘ make something of myself ’ ? ”
80112	80137	80238	80238	He	1651	“ I ’m not a nice guy , Brontë . I do n’t have to be , most times , because of my money . ”
80143	80237	80238	80238	He	1651	“ I told you once that my fiancée was only interested in me for my money . She was the only one I let get close enough before you . Usually women make their fascination with my money known right away , and then it ’s easy to just end things before someone gets hurt . I was afraid I was making the same mistake again , and I was losing my head over you . I wanted to test you , to see how you ’d respond . Thing is . . . ”
80246	80288	80294	80294	she	1652	“ You passed the test , of course . Except I ’d forgotten that you have feelings , too , and how you ’d feel about my little test . I ’m sorry . It was arrogant and stupid of me . ”
80289	80293	80238	80238	He	1651	“ It was , ”
80297	80308	80320	80320	He	1651	“ Why would you think I ’m after your money ? ”
80309	80319	80322	80322	his	1651	“ Maybe because most of the time everyone is ? ”
80325	80434	80452	80452	she	1653	“ It ’s not you , Brontë . It ’s me . I realize that now . I ’m a cynical bastard , especially when it comes to women . That ’s why I did n’t tell you who I really was when we were stranded together . And it ’s why I offered you the diner . It ’s not that there ’s something wrong with you . It ’s that there ’s something wrong with every other woman I ’ve ever had in my life . They could n’t see past my wallet to me . You can . And that ’s why I want you . ”
80457	80507	80528	80528	She	1653	“ I ca n’t trust you , Logan . I thought I could , but this just proved that you ’re not who I thought you were . You should n’t have to ‘ test ’ me . You should be able to trust me , and me you . ”
80508	80527	80536	80536	His	75	“ Give me another chance , Brontë . A chance to prove how much you mean to me . ”
80552	80565	80574	80574	she	1653	“ You told me you loved me that night in the limo . ”
80580	80585	80586	80586	Logan	75	“ I was mistaken . ”
80591	80596	80602	80602	she	1653	“ You were not . ”
80597	80601	80602	80602	she	1653	“ I was , ”
80613	80638	80646	80646	he	75	“ It was silly of me to think I ’d fallen in love with someone so fast , and time has proved me right . ”
80639	80645	80646	80646	he	75	“ I ’m not mistaken , ”
80662	80671	80646	80646	he	75	“ I ’m still in love with you . ”
80681	80686	80695	80695	he	75	“ Logan , please . ”
80687	80694	80695	80695	he	75	“ I ’m not fighting fair , ”
80699	80765	80799	80799	His	1655	“ I know . I do n’t care . I want you back . I do n’t give a shit about being fair or being the better man . I will be the most ruthless man in the world as long as I can have you at my side and in my bed . You ’re the only thing that matters . I love you . ”
80766	80798	80799	80799	His	1655	“ Love is not control , Logan . Love is partnership . Friendship . A wise man once said , ‘ If you want to be loved , be lovable . ’ ”
80803	80845	80871	80871	she	1656	“ I ’d say that ’s Plato , but I know it ’s not . I ’ve been reading the book you left me , you know . ‘ The madness of love is the greatest of heaven ’s blessings . ’ ”
80880	80933	80949	80949	He	1655	“ I do n’t know , Logan . We have n’t exactly had the most normal relationship . I never know how to act around you . I ’m about as comfortable in the hurricane as I am at one of your society parties . Both scare the pants off of me . ”
80934	80948	81003	81003	Brontë	85	“ Whatever you want to do , Brontë , I ’ll do it . ”
81014	81028	81044	81044	He	75	“ Come home with me tonight , Brontë . We ’ll start over . ”
81040	81043	81102	81102	Logan	75	“ No . ”
81092	81101	81109	81109	she	1656	“ Is this good - bye , then ? ”
81105	81108	81157	81157	she	1656	“ No , ”
81167	81174	81179	81179	His	75	“ I think we should date . ”
81175	81178	81196	81196	she	1656	“ Date ? ”
81192	81195	81196	81196	she	1656	“ Yes , ”
81204	81276	81283	81283	he	75	“ Date . You know , dinner and a movie . Bowling with friends . Going out for pizza and seeing the sights . Spending time together just to spend time together . A date . Several dates . I need to know that what I thought we had was real , Logan . And I need to know you want to be with me . I think we should date . ”
81277	81282	81287	81287	his	75	“ I want you , ”
81296	81315	81326	81326	she	1657	“ Going to see a movie is n’t going to change that . I love you , Brontë . ”
81316	81325	81326	81326	she	1657	“ But I need to date , Logan , ”
81330	81378	81446	81446	his	75	“ No fancy parties , no buying of restaurants . No hurricanes . You and me , on a few regular dates like normal people . We can see if we ’re truly compatible or if we ’re just caught up in the madness of it all . ”
81456	81474	81479	81479	she	1657	“ If you want me to win you over with romantic dates , Brontë . I will . ”
81475	81478	81492	81492	she	1657	“ Great , ”
81497	81502	81446	81446	his	75	“ Call me sometime . ”
81503	81511	81518	81518	she	1657	“ Let ’s go out . Tonight . ”
81512	81517	81518	81518	she	1657	“ Ca n’t tonight , ”
81522	81530	81546	81546	her	1657	“ I ’m working . Call me . ”
81551	81577	81582	81582	his	75	“ I ’m serious , Logan . I want to date like normal people . Not like a billionaire and the waitress he just bought . ”
81586	81597	81606	81606	she	1657	“ You know it ’s not like that , Brontë . ”
81619	81625	81798	81798	she	85	“ Then call me sometime . ”
81791	81797	81858	81858	she	85	“ Seventeen ninety - one , ”
81852	81857	81868	81868	Logan	75	“ H - hello ? ”
81861	81867	81868	81868	Logan	75	“ I ’m calling you , ”
81875	81881	81904	81904	she	85	“ Go out with me . ”
81909	81917	81949	81949	He	75	“ Where would you like to go ? ”
81918	81926	81938	81938	she	85	“ Dinner . Tonight . Someplace casual . ”
81927	81937	81965	81965	He	75	“ I told you . I ’m working tonight , ”
81975	81981	81989	81989	she	85	“ Tomorrow night , then . ”
81982	81988	81989	81989	she	85	“ Tomorrow night is good , ”
81994	82000	82165	82165	Gretchen	129	“ Where should we meet ? ”
82158	82164	82175	82175	Brontë	85	“ How do I look ? ”
82177	82183	82175	82175	Brontë	85	“ Are you dating Logan ? ”
82184	82188	82197	82197	Gretchen	129	“ I am . ”
82189	82196	82213	82213	Brontë	85	“ Then I do n’t care , ”
82206	82212	82213	82213	Brontë	85	“ Be fair , Gretchen , ”
82219	82242	82249	82249	Gretchen	129	“ We ’re just going to try each other out and see if we can have a good time like regular people . ”
82243	82248	82354	82354	Gretchen	129	“ Oh , please , ”
82310	82353	82385	82385	Gretchen	129	“ We both know that this is just some sadistic version of foreplay and you ’re still madly in love with him . You just want to make him dance to your tune for a while instead of the other way around . ”
82367	82384	82385	82385	Gretchen	129	“ So . . . does this outfit look okay for excruciatingly drawn - out foreplay ? ”
82400	82407	82393	82393	her	129	“ Are you wearing a bra ? ”
82408	82411	82393	82393	her	129	“ Absolutely . ”
82412	82418	82385	82385	Gretchen	129	“ A big ugly girdle ? ”
82419	82422	82447	82447	Brontë	85	“ No . ”
82423	82446	82447	82447	Brontë	85	“ Mmm . You need a big ugly girdle . It ’ll ensure you wo n’t want to get naked with him . ”
82455	82468	82475	82475	Gretchen	129	“ I ’m going to assume that this looks fine , then . ”
82469	82474	82490	82490	She	129	“ Fine , fine , ”
82499	82546	82475	82475	Gretchen	129	“ I ’m two chapters from the end of this stupid project , so I ’m going to be chained to the computer until it ’s done . I ’m totally fine with you staying out until all hours . Just in case you were wondering . ”
82547	82550	82490	82490	She	129	“ Gotcha . ”
82551	82555	82490	82490	She	129	“ Have fun . ”
82556	82560	82581	82581	Brontë	85	“ I will . ”
82561	82580	82779	82779	she	129	“ Do n’t do anything I would n’t do . That means most everything , by the way . ”
82773	82778	82779	82779	she	129	“ You look nice , ”
82787	82800	82860	82860	He	1682	“ I almost did n’t recognize you out of a business suit . ”
82818	82859	82860	82860	He	1682	“ It ’s been a while . I admit that it seems like everything I have in my closet has somehow magically transformed into either workout clothing or a suit . I had Audrey pick me up a few things . ”
82875	82881	82887	82887	she	129	“ Do I pass muster ? ”
82882	82886	82900	82900	he	1682	“ You do , ”
82894	82899	82900	82900	he	1682	“ You look gorgeous , ”
82918	82930	82951	82951	Logan	75	“ I ’ve missed getting to look at you every day . ”
82942	82950	82971	82971	she	129	“ I ’ve missed that , too , ”
82981	82987	82951	82951	Logan	75	“ Where are we going ? ”
82988	83003	83009	83009	He	1682	“ I thought we ’d grab something to eat and then see a movie . ”
83004	83008	83041	83041	He	1682	“ What movie ? ”
83019	83040	83047	83047	She	129	“ I do n’t know what ’s playing , to be honest . I forgot to ask Audrey to check . ”
83057	83070	83049	83049	her	129	“ We can just see whatever ’s showing . No big deal . ”
83079	83092	83097	83097	They	1683	“ I seem to have thought of everything but the date itself . ”
83093	83096	83151	83151	He	75	“ Oh ? ”
83110	83150	83151	83151	He	75	“ Indeed . I cleared my schedule , had Audrey purchase date clothes , picked out the restaurant , memorized some Plato — the usual . I even rode the subway here , just like a normal New Yorker . ”
83154	83176	83177	83177	She	129	“ I ’d prefer not to do that on a regular basis . The man next to me smelled like piss . ”
83189	83197	83251	83251	Logan	75	“ Well , I appreciate the effort . ”
83245	83250	83251	83251	Logan	75	“ Here we go , ”
83271	83281	83251	83251	Logan	75	“ I thought we ’d grab a slice here . ”
83299	83305	83325	83325	She	129	“ You like their food ? ”
83306	83324	83325	83325	She	129	“ I did when I was a teenager . This was my first job , you know . ”
83333	83338	83344	83344	He	75	“ You worked here ? ”
83339	83343	83344	83344	He	75	“ I did . ”
83362	83470	83484	83484	she	1690	“ I was going through a rebellious phase — drinking , smoking , staying out all night . The usual teenage boy stuff . My father could n’t deal with me . Of course , I never dealt well with my father , either . I ended up skipping classes for a few days and was suspended from school . My father wanted to teach me a lesson . He told me that I was too arrogant for my own good and that I needed to learn from someone who was n’t terrified of my family ’s money or position . So he dropped me off here . ”
83478	83483	83484	83484	she	1690	“ A family friend ? ”
83491	83613	83622	83622	She	1691	“ A very old friend of his from school . It turned out my father had given him the loan to start the place , so he owed my dad a favor . That favor was taking me on as an employee for a week . Andy — that ’s the owner ’s name — was a real drill sergeant , too . He had me washing floors and scrubbing toilets and standing over the sink for hours at a time . I remember that was the longest week of my life . I hated every minute of it , but my father told me that if I did n’t stay , he ’d kick me out . So I stayed . ”
83614	83621	83622	83622	She	1691	“ Your father sounds . . . ”
83629	83632	83484	83484	she	1690	“ Interesting . ”
83633	83673	83484	83484	she	1690	“ My father was a real asshole . But he was right about Andy . He kicked my ass and worked me harder than anyone ever had . And you know what happened at the end of that week ? ”
83674	83679	83684	83684	Logan	75	“ Your father relented ? ”
83680	83683	83827	83827	He	1692	“ Nope , ”
83691	83826	83827	83827	He	1692	“ Andy fired me . Said I was the shittiest worker he ’d ever seen and that three - year - olds had more drive than I did . That woke me up . Here was someone who was n’t afraid of my father ’s money or position . He just wanted a kid to wash dishes , and he ended up with me , who ’d never washed a dish in my life and was n’t about to start . But I was more afraid of my father than Andy , so I had to convince him to keep me on . Which meant working harder . I worked there all summer . Learned a lot about hard work and running a business . I respected the hell out of Andy , too . ”
83837	83840	83841	83841	Brontë	85	“ Hungry ? ”
83862	83875	83888	83888	Logan	75	“ You ’ve been wealthy all your life , have n’t you ? ”
83876	83887	83910	83910	She	85	“ Always , but it was n’t easy , either . ”
83917	83925	83940	83940	He	75	“ My father was a hard man . ”
83926	83939	83947	83947	he	75	“ Surely not all hard . Your mother must have loved him . ”
83955	83998	84006	84006	Brontë	85	“ My mother was a showgirl who wanted my father ’s money . She tolerated his bad moods since he was rich , and he tolerated her since she was gorgeous and pregnant with me . She died when I was five . ”
83999	84005	84045	84045	He	75	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
84028	84044	84045	84045	He	75	“ I am , too . That meant it was just me and my father . ”
84048	84055	84098	84098	she	85	“ He died two years ago . ”
84091	84097	84098	84098	she	85	“ This pizza is good , ”
84108	84112	84122	84122	He	75	“ Thank you . ”
84113	84121	84133	84133	She	85	“ So what was your first job ? ”
84136	84142	84098	84098	she	85	“ Babysitter , of course . ”
84143	84149	84184	84184	He	75	“ Did you enjoy it ? ”
84150	84183	84184	84184	He	75	“ It depended on the kids , really . Some were great , some were horrible . It gave me a lot of time to read when they were napping , though . ”
84187	84197	84209	84209	She	85	“ I can see why you took the job . ”
84198	84208	84209	84209	She	85	“ I am very transparent , are n’t I ? ”
84216	84224	84248	84248	she	85	“ And do you want kids someday ? ”
84264	84272	84273	84273	He	75	“ Someday , with the right person . ”
84276	84279	84280	84280	Logan	75	“ You ? ”
84288	84309	84514	84514	Brontë	85	“ Someday . I ’ve already found the right person . I ’m just waiting for her to be ready . ”
84501	84513	84532	84532	his	75	“ Are you going to give me a kiss good night ? ”
84535	84539	84545	84545	She	85	“ Not tonight . ”
84540	84544	84545	84545	She	85	“ Why not ? ”
84553	84568	84573	84573	Logan	75	“ I just mean . . . we ’ve already been lovers . I — ”
84569	84572	84588	84588	his	75	“ Brontë , ”
84603	84631	84588	84588	his	75	“ It ’s not that I do n’t want to kiss you . It ’s that if I start , I do n’t think I can stop . ”
84643	84648	84657	84657	he	75	“ Logan , I — ”
84649	84656	84657	84657	he	75	“ No , let me finish , ”
84660	84713	84714	84714	He	75	“ You need this to feel comfortable with me again . You want to date without the money or the power . I understand that . And now that I ’ve had some time to settle into the idea , I like it . So we ’re going to take things slow . ”
84737	84810	84843	84843	she	85	“ We ’re not going to take things to the next level again until you ’re ready . But I do n’t want just sex from you , Brontë . When we go to bed together again , it ’s going to be you and me . Strings attached and all . So think long and hard about what you want . Because I know what I want . I want you . ”
84829	84842	84848	84848	He	75	“ I do n’t know if I ’m ready for that yet , ”
84858	84871	84888	84888	she	85	“ Then we date again . What are you doing tomorrow night ? ”
84872	84887	84895	84895	he	75	“ I have to check my work calendar to see if I ’m free , ”
84891	84894	84895	84895	he	75	“ Brontë , ”
84899	84915	84921	84921	She	85	“ We both know you can be free tomorrow night . Do n’t play games . ”
84940	84954	84973	84973	He	75	“ I ’m free . What do you want to do , then ? ”
84955	84960	84988	84988	She	85	“ Be with you . ”
85012	85022	85035	85035	her	85	“ Do you want to go bowling ? Dinner ? ”
85023	85031	85035	85035	her	85	“ Have you been to Broadway yet ? ”
85037	85074	85092	85092	He	75	“ Oh ! No , I have n’t , but I ’m dying to . I would love to see a show ! Is n’t it too late to find tickets to anything good , though ? ”
85075	85091	85092	85092	He	75	“ Leave that up to me . I ’ll pick you up for dinner tomorrow . ”
85098	85104	85115	85115	She	85	“ Think of me tonight ? ”
85105	85114	85269	85269	She	129	“ I will . Good night , Logan . ”
85259	85268	85269	85269	She	129	“ Oh . Oh . It ’s late . ”
85280	85298	85303	85303	Brontë	85	“ Well , shit . I think I lost track of time . How ’d it go ? ”
85299	85302	85303	85303	Brontë	85	“ Good , ”
85310	85323	85333	85333	Gretchen	129	“ And bad . I ’m still totally in love with him . ”
85324	85332	85333	85333	Gretchen	129	“ Just do n’t tell him that , ”
85342	85357	85358	85358	Brontë	85	“ I guess I ’ll stop hating him until you two break up again . ”
85363	85375	85400	85400	She	129	“ Very funny . We ’re going out again tomorrow night . ”
85376	85399	85423	85423	Brontë	85	“ Fine with me . That ’ll give me a chance to fix this last chapter I wrote . It ’s horrible . ”
85408	85422	85423	85423	Brontë	85	“ Good thing this book wo n’t have my real name on it . ”
85426	85442	85443	85443	Gretchen	129	“ Well , I ’m heading off to bed . See you in the morning . ”
85452	85456	85979	85979	he	75	“ See you . ”
85983	85985	85979	85979	he	75	“ slow ”
85987	85990	86055	86055	he	75	“ glacial . ”

90422	90435	90440	90440	he	75	“ Never mind . Keep touching me . I ’m obviously delusional . ”
90436	90439	90554	90554	he	75	“ Clearly , ”
90550	90553	90570	90570	she	85	“ Hands ? ”
90583	90587	90592	90592	He	75	“ Like this ? ”
90588	90591	90592	90592	He	75	“ Exactly . ”
90619	90638	90647	90647	she	85	“ You ’re gorgeous . I could look at you all day and never get tired of it . ”

90671	90682	90704	90704	She	85	“ Ah , but this is about me pleasing you , ”
90692	90703	90748	90748	he	75	“ And you ’re not playing fair . No touching . ”
90742	90747	90748	90748	he	75	“ Keep them here , ”

90914	90927	90928	90928	Logan	75	“ I just . . . it felt appropriate at the moment . ”
90931	90951	90966	90966	he	75	“ Very appropriate , except I am enjoying looking at you far too much to claim to be blind . ”
90962	90965	90970	90970	Her	85	“ Plato ? ”
90976	90983	90989	90989	he	75	“ Sextus Propertius , I believe . ”

91268	91273	91297	91297	he	75	“ Now , love , ”
91277	91295	91318	91318	He	75	“ If I was a horrible tease , I ’d move in and touch you like so . ”
91333	91374	91396	91396	He	75	“ But I ’m not finished playing , Brontë . And if I continue to touch you here , you ’ll come . And I do n’t want that just yet . I ’m enjoying teasing you far too much . ”
91409	91418	91432	91432	she	85	“ Are you not having fun , love ? ”
91419	91431	91608	91608	he	75	“ I ’m not sure if this is fun or torture , ”
91604	91607	91717	91717	He	75	“ Delicious , ”
91711	91716	91769	91769	she	85	“ Oh , Logan . ”

91923	91929	91970	91970	she	85	“ Do you , now ? ”

92329	92334	92359	92359	Her	85	“ More than anything . ”
92353	92358	92448	92448	he	75	“ Then taste me . ”
92444	92447	92448	92448	he	75	“ Brontë , ”
92451	92459	92559	92559	She	85	“ Ah , God , your mouth . ”

94739	94776	94788	94788	She	85	“ Because our relationship is all messed up , Logan . You and I were ‘ moved in together ’ before we barely even knew each other , and look at how well that worked out . ”
94777	94787	94793	94793	he	75	“ It worked out just fine in my eyes . ”
94798	94826	94847	94847	His	75	“ Nothing ’s changed , Logan . Last night was great , but I ’m allowed to sleep with a guy and not move in with him . ”

94853	94862	94873	94873	He	75	“ What ? No . Of course not . ”

94883	94909	94866	94866	his	75	“ I ’m not seeing anyone else , and you ’re not either . This thing we have , it ’s just you and me . ”
94910	94914	94926	94926	He	75	“ All right . ”
94915	94925	94926	94926	He	75	“ And you ’re moving back in with me . ”
94937	94950	94951	94951	Logan	75	“ No , I ’m not . Not until I ’m ready . ”
94965	94983	94926	94926	He	75	“ What will it take to make you ready ? I want you back in my bed . ”
94984	94993	95024	95024	She	1793	“ You have me back in a bed . ”
94994	95023	95051	95051	she	1793	“ In my bed , for good . And in my life , Brontë . I want you in my life most of all . At my side . ”
95056	95071	95112	95112	He	75	“ I ’m not ready yet , Logan . Please do n’t pressure me . ”
95102	95111	95112	95112	He	75	“ I ’m disappointed , but I understand . ”
95123	95138	95161	95161	He	75	“ The offer remains , of course . Accept it when you ’re ready . ”
95154	95160	95161	95161	He	75	“ Thank you , Logan . ”
95166	95173	95161	95161	He	75	“ What are you doing today ? ”
95174	95181	95161	95161	He	75	“ I work in an hour . ”
95182	95190	95195	95195	she	1793	“ Want me to clear your schedule ? ”
95191	95194	95195	95195	she	1793	“ No , ”
95201	95215	95240	95240	He	75	“ I need to work , and Cooper could use the help today . ”
95235	95239	95242	95242	his	75	“ Maybe tonight . ”
95245	95251	95242	95242	his	75	“ Tonight I ’m busy . ”
95252	95255	95242	95242	his	75	“ Oh ? ”
95263	95268	95273	95273	he	75	“ Busy with what ? ”
95269	95272	95273	95273	he	75	“ Meeting , ”
95277	95285	95291	95291	she	1793	“ I ’ll be free tomorrow night . ”
95286	95290	95293	95293	him	75	“ All right , ”
95295	95302	95321	95321	he	75	“ I ’ll miss you tonight . ”
95332	95337	95348	95348	She	1793	“ I love you . ”
95351	95358	95361	95361	herself	1793	“ I love you , too , ”
95363	95369	95372	95372	he	75	“ What brought that on ? ”
95386	95397	95372	95372	he	75	“ I want you to come to my meeting tonight . ”
95398	95407	95372	95372	he	75	“ You do ? To a business meeting ? “
95420	95421	95423	95423	you	75	” “
95429	95430	95423	95423	you	75	” “
95435	95841	95842	95842	You	1795	” he said , his smile surprisingly grim . * * * Brontë was lost in thought as she walked the streets of SoHo , heading to Cooper ’s Cuppa . Gretchen had n’t been at the apartment that morning , and Brontë suspected that she had returned home late the night before and quietly left for work that morning without disturbing Brontë or her guest . It suited Brontë just fine . While they normally walked to work together , strolling by herself allowed her to clear her head and think a little . Her night with Logan had been . . . intense . Magical . Wonderful . If she had n’t already been in love with him , she would be by now . But it was also a little troubling . He ’d wanted her to move back in with him as if nothing had happened , and she was still mentally working through some of their issues . When all was said and done , he was still a billionaire used to getting his way in everything , and she was still a waitress . Their massive power incompatibility worried her . Men like him did n’t date waitresses . Men like him bought the establishment and slept with the waitresses , she thought wryly . That was her situation . . . and yet it was n’t . Logan had proved he was n’t what she ’d expected , just as she was n’t what he ’d expected , she supposed . But she could n’t quite bring herself to fling it all away and return to being his live - in girlfriend . To have no other role in his life than being arm candy that was fun in bed . She did n’t know what to do . Logan had said the offer stood , but what if he did n’t wait forever ? What if he got tired of waiting for her to be comfortable with who he was and he moved on and forgot about her ? Tears pricked at her eyes , and she swiped them away , pulling open the door to the coffee shop . Gretchen was behind the counter already , her red hair pulled up in a messy knot , her glasses sliding down her nose . She looked up at Brontë ’s entrance and gave her a startled look . “
95847	95848	95842	95842	You	1795	” “
95852	95862	95866	95866	I	0	” Brontë said stiffly , heading to the back . “
95869	95884	95899	95911	the tall , dark , and rich guy who was over last night	1797	” Gretchen stepped out from behind the counter , following Brontë to the office . “
95913	95914	95899	95911	the tall , dark , and rich guy who was over last night	1797	” “
95937	95938	95899	95911	the tall , dark , and rich guy who was over last night	1797	” “
95947	95988	95899	95911	the tall , dark , and rich guy who was over last night	1797	” Gretchen asked playfully . The words were meant as a tease , but it was too much for Brontë . She sniffed loudly and stared at her locker , willing herself not to cry . It did n’t work . “
95993	96015	96016	96016	I	0	” Gretchen said , pulling one of the spare brown aprons off of a coat hook and handing it to her . “
96024	96025	96016	96016	I	0	” “
96030	96051	96063	96063	You	0	” Brontë said , dabbing at her eyes with the apron and collapsing into a heap on a nearby stool . “
96061	96062	96063	96063	You	0	” “
96097	96145	96153	96153	You	0	” Brontë nodded . Five minutes later , they were settled into the smallest back booth of the coffee shop , hot mocha cappuccinos in hand . Cooper looked at them curiously from time to time , but he did n’t pry , and Brontë was grateful . “
96148	96152	96169	96169	you	0	” Gretchen said . “
96173	96194	96203	96203	He	151	” Brontë shook her head , grabbing a handful of napkins as she felt the confused tears welling up again . “
96210	96215	96206	96206	he	151	” Gretchen nodded thoughtfully . “
96233	96245	96321	96322	That bastard	1801	” She giggled , the sound a little choked with tears . “
96319	96320	96321	96322	That bastard	1801	” “
96324	96329	96365	96365	I	0	” Gretchen said ironically . “
96355	96364	96392	96392	he	75	” She made a face at her friend . “
96401	96402	96392	96392	he	75	” “
96406	96413	96421	96421	He	75	” Gretchen sipped her coffee thoughtfully . “
96419	96420	96429	96430	That bastard	1801	” “
96427	96428	96429	96430	That bastard	1801	” “
96432	96433	96446	96446	He	75	” “
96461	96467	96468	96468	I	0	” She frowned in thought . “
96475	96476	96468	96468	I	0	” “
96479	96484	96504	96504	You	0	” Gretchen said huffily . “
96499	96503	96504	96504	You	0	” Brontë glared . “
96509	96510	96504	96504	You	0	” “
96516	96526	96534	96534	you	129	” Gretchen said , matter - of - factly . “
96538	96550	96606	96606	He	75	” Brontë continued to glare at Gretchen . The redhead shrugged . “
96604	96605	96623	96623	I	0	” “
96633	96634	96667	96667	Audrey	125	” “
96669	96680	96700	96700	you	0	” When Brontë glared at her again , Gretchen sighed . “
96702	96703	96711	96711	Logan	75	” “
96706	96707	96754	96754	you	0	” “
96757	96758	96754	96754	you	0	” “
96767	96768	96773	96773	you	0	” “
96782	96796	96804	96804	I	0	” Brontë opened her mouth to protest , then snapped it shut again . “
96811	96812	96817	96817	I	0	” “
96829	96834	96817	96817	I	0	” Gretchen said drily . “
96840	96844	96875	96875	I	0	” Brontë said . “
96880	96881	96886	96887	a waitress	483	” “
96889	96893	96995	96995	I	0	” Gretchen said . “
96911	96994	97026	97026	he	619	” She was right , Brontë realized . Oh , God . Everything she was saying was right . Brontë was blaming Logan for being . . . Logan . Logan was who he was — a little alpha , take - charge , and always thinking ahead . And she ’d been punishing him for being who he was instead of loving him for it . She ’d been the problem all along . Her stomach gave a sick little lurch . “
97039	97040	97077	97077	yours	129	” “
97083	97091	97154	97158	a great editor or two	1821	” Brontë stared down at her cappuccino . “
97132	97133	97193	97193	My	0	” “
97182	97192	97255	97255	You	129	” Gretchen leaned over and clasped Brontë ’s hand . “
97262	97289	97296	97296	you	85	” Strange how a friend telling her to make something of herself came across far more gently than when Logan had . Brontë smiled at Gretchen . “
97304	97305	97296	97296	you	85	” “
97310	97314	97334	97334	You	85	” Gretchen said . “
97340	97361	97420	97420	Logan	75	” Brontë stuck her tongue out at Gretchen . The redhead grinned , and gave Brontë ’s hand another squeeze . “
97425	97426	97427	97427	Cooper	143	” “
97436	97454	97458	97458	he	1822	” Brontë said carefully . The look of chagrin on Gretchen ’s face was terrible to see . “
97465	97470	97497	97498	someone different	1828	” she said quietly . “
97500	97512	97545	97545	You	129	” She smiled at Brontë , and her smile was sad . “
97534	97544	97563	97563	He	1822	” Brontë nodded and squeezed Gretchen ’s hand back . “
97561	97562	97593	97593	he	1822	” “
97580	97588	97593	97593	he	1822	” Gretchen gave her a teasing laugh . “
97604	98329	97593	97593	he	1822	” * * * For the first time in years , Logan felt an emotion that had become foreign to him . He was nervous . Tonight was going to be a clusterfuck . It was one of the brotherhood meetings . They had a strict rule that no additional parties were allowed . No siblings . No buddies . No parents . No business partners . Just the original six . No one had ever thought of breaking the rules , because it would have been unfair to the others in the group . And here Logan was , their leader , about to bring the woman he loved to a meeting and explain to her that he was part of a secret society of billionaires . The tattoo on his arm ? A badge of membership . His success ? Interlocked with that of his brothers . He hoped she ’d understand . He knew there could n’t be any more secrets between them , not if he wanted to keep her . And he was laying it all on the line , betting everything he had , because he needed her to realize just how much he loved and trusted her . And how different she was from everyone else . The others would be furious . They would n’t understand . None of them were married or even had steady girlfriends , though Reese had a steady stream of women . But Logan had to do this . He could n’t risk losing Brontë forever . So he ’d show her everything . . . and hope she would n’t be put off by the nondisclosure agreement she ’d have to sign . Danica had balked at the prenup and shown her true colors . What would Brontë do ? Was he going to lose everything just by trying to include her in his life ? He hoped not . * * * Brontë studied her closet . She had no idea what to wear to this mystery meeting . Meeting implied business , but Logan said it was friends . She studied the clothes hanging in the small closet . Go casual ? Or dress up in anticipation of something fussy ? She could n’t decide . Tonight felt important for some reason , though she had no idea why . Her mind was still on this morning ’s conversation with Gretchen . Logan had offered himself just as he was , and she had been the one with the problem . It was a bit humbling . There was nothing wrong with being a waitress , of course . She liked her job and liked working with people . But she could n’t be a waitress and be with Logan . The two were completely incompatible . Waitressing was hard work with odd hours . She did n’t want to be too tired to see him — or too busy . And it did n’t make sense for her to bust her butt for tips when he had money . She had to choose . And she was going to pick the gorgeous man she was in love with , of course . It was just a matter of admitting it to herself . She decided on a simple black sweater and dark gray skirt with heels . Dressy enough that she could pass for formal , but it would n’t look out of place if the evening was casual . She smoothed her hair , applied a bit of makeup , and waited for Logan to arrive , her stomach fluttering with nervousness . She had a feeling tonight was going to change everything in their relationship . * * * The dark sedan had shown up for their date , and Brontë did n’t even blink when the driver got out to open the doors . She would just have to get used to that sort of thing in the future , she told herself . Logan got out of the car and kissed her lightly , then held the door open for her to get in . Brontë smiled at the driver as she entered , then slid over to make room for Logan . When he was seated next to her , she asked , “
98338	98339	97593	97593	he	1822	” “
98344	98506	98516	98516	I	0	” he told her , seemingly distracted , but he reached for her hand . With a nod to the driver , the car pulled away from the curb , and they began to head back toward midtown . Brontë watched the buildings that passed , noting streets and trying to determine where exactly they were going . Where was this meeting being held ? To her surprise , they pulled up in front of a small bar . She gave Logan a curious look , but followed him out of the car and onto the street . He put his hand on the small of her back and guided her forward . Inside , the bar was quiet , only a few patrons seated at wooden tables . It looked very . . . ordinary . A hockey game was playing on a TV set in the corner , and no one was paying a bit of attention to them . “
98514	98515	98522	98522	I	0	” “
98525	98736	98765	98766	The others	242	” Curious , she let him lead her to one of the back doors . A dark , narrow hallway was lit by a single unadorned lightbulb , and at the far end stood a large hulking man next to a door . Logan stepped in front of her and headed toward the man , and unease grew in her stomach . This . . . was n’t normal . Was this some kind under - the - table business deal ? Something illegal ? Oh , God . Was Logan into trafficking ? The drug trade ? Her stomach twisted with anxiety . Surely not . She ’d never expected such a thing from Logan , but what were they doing down here in this dingy hallway for a business meeting ? She did n’t understand . The man eyed them with a cold expression , saying nothing , and Brontë resisted the urge to step behind Logan and let him shield her . Logan lifted his hand and placed two fingers over his heart , then moved it up to his shoulder , and slid them down his sleeve . A very specific gesture . The man nodded as if satisfied , and his glare fixed on Brontë . “
98742	98764	98765	98766	The others	242	” Logan told him . The man ’s eyebrows went up , but he simply nodded and gestured at the door . “
98770	99032	99039	99039	Logan	75	” This was clearly some sort of secret meeting . Her stomach clenched again . Surely Logan was n’t in the Mafia , was he ? Then again , this was New York City . Logan pushed the door open and then gestured for Brontë to enter . She did , stepping down a narrow line of cement stairs into . . . a basement . A very well lit basement . Cigar smoke hung in the air , and she could hear the murmur of conversation that abruptly stilled as she descended the last stair and came into the others ’ view . A poker table sat in the center of the room . A drink table at the far end . Chips were scattered about , along with half - full glasses and ashtrays . Around the table sat five men , all scowling at the sight of her . And . . . she recognized four of them . Jonathan , who ’d been their helicopter rescuer — and who was as fabulously wealthy as Logan — sat on the far end of the table , a cigar held between his teeth . Cade sat in the middle , his expression more welcoming than the others , but equally perplexed . To his right she recognized Reese , whom she ’d met only briefly . And Griffin . And there was one man with his back to her , only part of his face visible . Reese threw down his cigar and cards , getting to his feet . “
99041	99056	99059	99059	Brontë	85	” Logan adjusted the cuff links of his jacket as if nothing were amiss . “
99064	99065	99066	99066	You	75	” “
99074	99138	99142	99142	you	75	” Griffin abruptly stopped short , as if realizing what he was about to say . Brontë ’s heart sank . They were all wealthy . All wealthy and conducting secret meetings together ? It could only be one thing . She turned to Logan , and tears shimmered in her eyes . She did n’t know whether she was hurt or terrified . “
99151	99152	99180	99180	I	0	” “
99156	99179	99180	99180	I	0	” Loud bursts of laughter rocked the table behind her , and Brontë turned , confused , then looked back at Logan . “
99185	99186	99191	99192	the Mafia	3082	” “
99196	99201	99231	99231	Logan	75	” he said patiently . “
99229	99230	99231	99231	Logan	75	” “
99233	99241	99244	99244	you	75	” Jonathan said in a warning voice . “
99247	99264	99281	99281	We	1839	” Logan ignored him , his gaze on Brontë . He took her hand in his . “
99297	99303	99308	99308	I	0	” He studied her face . “
99312	99313	99308	99308	I	0	” “
99319	99323	99344	99344	He	0	” Reese said . “
99328	99343	99348	99348	his	0	” another gruff voice said . It was the man Brontë did n’t know . “
99351	99380	99348	99348	his	0	” Brontë ’s head swirled with what he was telling her . He was watching her and it seemed to be important , but she did n’t understand . “
99393	99446	99348	99348	his	0	” She stopped when he put his hand on his biceps , over the tattoo . Two fingers . A two - dollar bill . It had seemed so odd to her that someone like Logan would have such a bizarre tattoo . It made sense now , though . She gasped . “
99451	99452	99461	99461	We	1849	” “
99456	99460	99461	99461	We	1849	” Logan agreed . “
99471	99472	99516	99516	you	0	” “
99496	99514	99516	99516	you	0	” Reese said sarcastically . But Logan ’s gaze was serious as he stared down at her . “
99519	99540	99549	99549	I	0	” She thought for a moment , then took her clutch purse and whacked Logan on the arm with it . “
99560	99561	99602	99602	Our	1849	” “
99605	99616	99625	99625	I	0	” After a long , serious moment , he added , “
99629	99729	99730	99730	I	0	” Brontë gazed up at Logan , shocked . This . . . this was a big secret . He was trusting her with everything . Giving her everything that he was . He wanted — needed — her in his life that badly ? She realized then that Danica had been wrong about Logan . He did n’t treat everything like business . He ’d come down into this basement knowing full well that his friends — and business partners , it seemed — would be utterly furious with him . He was risking everything . For her . “
99736	99747	99749	99749	I	0	” she told him with a catch in her throat . “
99759	99772	99773	99773	They	2478	” A grin lit his face , and he pulled her close . “
99779	99813	99773	99773	They	2478	” He kissed her — long , hard , and fierce . So fiercely that her knees went weak , and she sagged against him . Behind them , someone cleared his throat . “
99820	99828	99873	99873	You	1856	” Griffin said in a cultured voice . “
99850	99872	99873	99873	You	1856	” She turned to look at them , unhappy that this moment of trust was going to cost Logan so much . “
99890	99891	99873	99873	You	1856	” “
99895	99905	99924	99924	you	1856	” Jonathan said flatly . Brontë looked at Logan . “
99929	99930	99924	99924	you	1856	” “
99935	99939	99924	99924	you	1856	” Logan asked . “
99946	99959	99924	99924	you	1856	” she said with a nod , glancing back at the table . “
99966	99967	99924	99924	you	1856	” “
99971	99975	99924	99924	you	1856	” Reese said . “
99996	99997	99924	99924	you	1856	” “
100002	100008	100015	100016	anyone else	2246	” Logan said , grinning . “
100018	100033	100015	100016	anyone else	2246	” A warm feeling swept through her , and she could n’t stop smiling . “
100038	100042	100015	100016	anyone else	2246	” Reese said . “
100053	100054	100015	100016	anyone else	2246	” “
100058	100062	100079	100079	We	1859	” Cade said . “
100089	100146	100079	100079	We	1859	” Logan moved to the table and pulled out his chair for Brontë , motioning for her to sit down . She did , pretending she did n’t see the wary looks on the men ’s faces . While Logan had invited her in for the evening , it was clear that she still was n’t exactly “
100148	100153	100079	100079	We	1859	” in their eyes . “
100159	100163	100079	100079	We	1859	” Logan said . “
100170	100176	100079	100079	We	1859	” Griffin pointed out succinctly . “
100187	100188	100079	100079	We	1859	” “
100202	100226	100227	100227	I	0	” Logan said . It got very quiet . Cade began to push some chips toward her , but Brontë shook her head . “
100236	100256	100258	100258	I	0	” she lied , sensing that her playing would push a few of the men past their comfort zone . “
100268	100275	100298	100299	your friends	2478	” She smiled at Logan reassuringly . “
100301	100302	100318	100318	I	0	” “
100307	100317	100318	100318	I	0	” Reese proclaimed , picking up his cigar again . “
100323	100461	100318	100318	I	0	” Logan said . Brontë blushed , getting up from the chair so Logan could sit down . Was that just more guy talk ? It was far too early to be thinking about marriage . But their banter and her backing off from the table had the desired effect . She immediately sensed a bit of the tension easing off the table and knew she ’d made the right decision . These were Logan ’s friends , and Logan ’s club . He was welcome to it , and she would n’t share the secret . As if he could tell what she was thinking , Logan sat down in the chair and dragged her into his lap . Two drinks were set in front of them — whiskey or brandy from the looks of it . “
100465	100508	100318	100318	I	0	” Jonathan said . They did , and Brontë coughed at the burning taste of the drink , which made the men laugh . Her face flushed with embarrassment , but Logan only pulled her closer , settling her on his lap . “
100519	100685	100692	100692	Griffin	78	” he said , grinning up at her . * * * As the evening wore on , drinks , cards — and business advice — flew freely around the table . Brontë lost track of most of the conversation due to the drinks that the men kept sending her way — deliberately , she suspected , to distract her . That was fine . She ended up spending half the night discussing the exaggerations of the account of Atlantis in Plato ’s Timaeus . Griffin was funding an archaeological dig in Spain for a theoretical site near Cadiz , and they chatted about it while the men played cards . It seemed that while Plato thought Atlantis was an island in the ocean , recent theory was that Atlantis was on the Spanish coast , and it intrigued him to investigate it . He even offered to take her and Logan to see the site sometime , which made her brighten and Logan scowl . “
100694	100695	100735	100735	I	0	” “
100716	100734	100740	100740	I	0	” Griffin said , but he winked at her as if sharing a joke . Logan snorted . “
100754	100804	100818	100818	We	1873	” Griffin just shook his head , but Brontë noticed he did n’t meet her gaze again , which told her that Logan had hit pretty close to the mark . At some point , Logan kissed her ear and stood up , sliding her out of his lap . “
100826	100827	100818	100818	We	1873	” “
100831	100848	100857	100857	I	0	” she said , clutching her newly refilled glass to her breast , her head buzzing . “
100855	100856	100904	100904	I	0	” “
100874	100903	100993	100994	Your friend	2821	” She nodded , her brain fuzzy , and sat back down in Logan ’s chair . Cade frowned as the three men left and then stood himself . “
100916	100992	101028	101029	The redhead	1561	” He left , and Griffin followed him out . That left Brontë holding her glass and the man seated next to her , who had been quiet all night . He ’d been careful not to look over at her , and she was curious about him . Hunter . Did he not like her ? Brontë frowned and took another swig of her whiskey , watching him over the rim of her snifter . “
100996	101027	101038	101038	You	0	” Hunter said after a long moment . His voice was deep and gravelly . He spoke as if the words were a chore . He was an odd man . “
101036	101037	101044	101044	Gretchen	129	” “
101042	101043	101044	101044	Gretchen	129	” “
101046	101057	101060	101060	her	1561	” He repeated the name , as if tasting it . “
101064	101065	101070	101070	you	0	” “
101075	101076	101090	101090	Gretchen	129	” “
101092	101133	101172	101172	I	0	” Brontë frowned , her thoughts slow and diffuse from alcohol . Something about giving her friend ’s information to a stranger seemed . . . not right , but she was having a hard time reasoning as to why . “
101148	101171	101187	101188	a stalker	1879	” Hunter stared down at his cards , and she realized he was carefully hiding one hand behind the other . Interesting . “
101184	101185	101187	101188	a stalker	1879	” “
101190	101195	101214	101215	a stalker	1879	” Brontë repeated drunkenly . “
101209	101210	101214	101215	a stalker	1879	” “
101219	101384	101401	101401	I	0	” she pointed out , taking another sip of her drink . He ground his teeth and glared over at her . Brontë got her first good look at his face . . . and she suddenly understood why he ’d been so careful to turn away from her , and why he hid his hand . Thick white scars stood out in relief against his tanned skin . They crossed his face in an irregular , scattered pattern that indicated massive trauma . One corner of his eye was tilted down , as if the repairs had altered its shape , and the side of his mouth had a jagged white line curving from it — a seam that had been torn open and repaired . Even the hand he ’d covered showed the white , gouging lines of scarring . It was not a pretty sight . Not in the slightest . Brontë swallowed hard , her stomach churning from the alcohol . “
101395	101400	101401	101401	I	0	” Hunter gritted out . “
101410	101411	101448	101448	Penway	154	” “
101414	101447	101448	101448	Penway	154	” Brontë said , forcing herself to turn away from the hideous webbing of scars . She stared down at her glass , which seemed a little too empty at the moment . “
101450	101454	101461	101461	She	2821	” she said . “
101465	101466	101461	101461	She	2821	” “
101472	101473	101507	101508	A ghostwriter	2802	” “
101483	101506	101507	101508	A ghostwriter	2802	” His gaze seemed to pin her to Logan ’s chair , and she wished she had a bit more to drink . “
101510	101523	101538	101538	Cooper	143	” Brontë nodded , then stopped because it made the room wobble . “
101536	101537	101538	101538	Cooper	143	” “
101540	101548	101573	101573	She	129	” He rasped the word out harshly . “
101583	101615	101631	101631	I	0	” The scarred man snorted and lifted his own drink , and Brontë peeked over at him . Nope , the scars did n’t look any better on the second glance . “
101621	101630	101633	101633	I	0	” she asked , feeling a little faint . “
101640	101648	101654	101654	Reese	77	” Hunter smiled grimly over at her . “
101664	101690	101708	101708	I	0	” She stared at him in surprise , then bolted to her feet . The room shifted woozily , and she grasped at the chair . “
101717	101718	101727	101727	Fists	155	” “
101734	101738	101727	101727	Fists	155	” Hunter said . “
101746	101777	101785	101785	I	0	” Brontë flopped back to her seat , holding her stomach . Suddenly , being drunk in a dark , smoky room did n’t seem like such a good idea . “
101795	101826	101831	101831	Gretchen	129	” Hunter set a tumbler in front of her and filled it with water . When she reached for it , he laid a hand over it , blocking her . “
101833	101864	101867	101867	she	129	” Brontë glared at him and brushed his hand aside . She took the glass anyhow and started sipping it . When her stomach stopped doing flips , she began , “
101874	101874	101923	101923	he	75	”
101932	101935	101946	101946	She	85	“ Morning . ”
101963	101967	101946	101946	She	85	“ I hurt . ”
101968	101974	102005	102005	He	75	“ Do you need aspirin ? ”
101998	102004	102005	102005	He	75	“ Dry toast , please ? ”
102010	102015	102112	102112	Logan	75	“ Coming right up . ”
102126	102130	102169	102169	she	85	“ You okay ? ”
102172	102187	102169	102169	she	85	“ My head ’s so fuzzy , it feels like the ground is moving . ”
102188	102191	102320	102320	Logan	75	“ Huh . ”
102302	102312	102320	102320	Logan	75	“ Are we . . . are we flying ? ”
102313	102319	102320	102320	Logan	75	“ Do n’t get up , ”
102330	102340	102393	102393	He	75	“ Lie down and relax . You ’re hungover . ”
102388	102392	102393	102393	He	75	“ Your face ! ”
102406	102440	102447	102447	Brontë	85	“ Yeah . The guys and I had a little talk . When we land , the nondisclosure agreement will be waiting at my office for you to sign . The others insist . ”
102441	102446	102447	102447	Brontë	85	“ That ’s fine , ”
102456	102464	102480	102480	he	75	“ Whatever gets them off your back . ”
102465	102479	102480	102480	he	75	“ I ’m sorry if you feel I ’m pushing you into it , ”
102488	102499	102520	102520	she	85	“ I know you ’re probably not happy about it . ”
102512	102519	102520	102520	she	85	“ I actually do n’t care , ”
102537	102566	102572	102572	she	85	“ It ’s not a big deal . I would n’t go telling all your secrets anyhow , but if the paperwork makes them feel better . . . ”
102577	102580	102583	102583	his	75	“ Why ? ”
102591	102606	102615	102615	he	75	“ I just . . . I guess I expected you to be upset . ”
102624	102634	102663	102663	Logan	75	“ This is why I love you , Brontë . ”
102657	102662	102663	102663	Logan	75	“ Rest , love , ”
102683	102693	102701	102701	she	85	“ You have a few hours before we land . ”
102694	102700	102701	102701	she	85	“ Where are we going ? ”
102705	102718	102763	102763	She	85	“ It ’s a surprise . One I think you ’ll enjoy . ”
102770	102788	102799	102799	She	85	“ Come on . We ’ll miss the ferry to Seaturtle Cay if we do n’t hurry . ”
102789	102798	102807	102807	he	75	“ We ’re going back to the resort ? ”
102816	102835	102843	102843	he	75	“ I do n’t understand . Is n’t it wrecked ? How can it be open for business ? ”
102836	102842	102843	102843	he	75	“ It ’s not open , ”
102847	102879	103133	103133	his	1908	“ But not all the rooms are destroyed , and I thought you would n’t mind having another look at the place when a hurricane is n’t bearing down on you . ”
103140	103153	103159	103159	Logan	75	“ Mr. Hawkings . It is a pleasure to see you here . ”
103154	103158	103159	103159	Logan	75	“ Mr. Douglas , ”
103162	103171	103200	103201	Mr. Douglas	156	“ Things look like they are proceeding well . ”
103172	103199	103200	103201	Mr. Douglas	156	“ Indeed they are . Repairs have continued around the clock , and once the upgrades are decided upon , we can continue with the renovations . ”
103206	103213	103214	103214	Brontë	85	“ This must be Miss Dawson . ”
103225	103231	103242	103242	Logan	75	“ Pleasure to meet you . ”
103232	103241	103242	103242	Logan	75	“ Miss Dawson is tired from our trip , ”
103249	103255	103261	103262	Mr. Douglas	156	“ Is our room ready ? ”
103256	103260	103261	103262	Mr. Douglas	156	“ It is , ”
103269	103281	103291	103291	Logan	75	“ Everything that you have asked for is ready and waiting . ”
103297	103338	103346	103346	Logan	75	“ Love , I need to meet with Mr. Douglas to discuss some things . Would you like to go up and check out our suite ? Let me know if there ’s something that ’s not to your liking . ”
103371	103378	103393	103394	The manager	334	“ What floor are we on ? ”
103379	103392	103393	103394	The manager	334	“ I will have someone show you the way , Miss Dawson . ”
103405	103419	103425	103425	Luz	158	“ Luz , please escort Miss Dawson to Mr. Hawkings ’s personal suite . ”
103420	103424	103425	103425	Luz	158	“ Right away , ”
103432	103437	103438	103438	Logan	75	“ Please follow me . ”
103448	103455	103494	103494	Luz	158	“ I ’ll be up shortly . ”
103486	103493	103494	103494	Luz	158	“ Can we take the stairs ? ”
103501	103518	103519	103519	Brontë	85	“ It is twenty floors up . Are you sure you wish to take the stairs ? ”
103522	103532	103538	103538	Luz	158	“ Oh , I ’m sure . Very sure . ”
103533	103537	103846	103846	She	85	“ Very well , ”
103814	103845	103846	103846	She	85	“ There are no keys for this room , Miss Dawson . You simply need to use the access code . It is five - five - four - three . ”
103857	103879	103885	103885	Brontë	85	“ Please call down and let me know if there is anything else I can do for you during your stay . ”
103880	103884	103885	103885	Brontë	85	“ I will , ”
103888	103894	104084	104084	She	85	“ Thank you , Luz . ”
104032	104035	104262	104262	His	75	“ living room ”
104268	104275	104282	104282	she	85	“ Do you like the room ? ”
104276	104281	104282	104282	she	85	“ It ’s gorgeous , ”
104289	104296	104332	104332	Brontë	85	“ I could stay here forever . ”
104306	104331	104332	104332	Brontë	85	“ How about a week ? I have some business to attend to while we ’re here and need to stay until next Saturday . ”
104340	104352	104359	104359	he	75	“ How about you ask before dragging me onto your jet ? ”
104353	104358	104359	104359	he	75	“ I did ask , ”
104369	104393	104394	104394	She	85	“ If I recall , you told me that you loved the idea . And then you fell over and began to snore . ”
104399	104419	104362	104362	his	75	“ How about asking me when I ’m sober ? I ’m supposed to work for the next week . ”
104420	104430	104497	104497	He	75	“ Gretchen says they will be fine without you . ”
104431	104437	104452	104452	Brontë	85	“ You talked to Gretchen ? ”
104438	104451	104497	104497	He	75	“ She packed a bag for you . Do n’t you remember ? ”
104472	104483	104490	104490	Logan	75	“ I ’m sure it ’ll come back to me . ”
104484	104489	104522	104522	he	75	“ I ’m sure , ”
104532	104542	104543	104543	His	75	“ Logan , I want to talk to you . ”
104549	104558	104585	104585	His	75	“ Talk , love . I ’m listening . ”
104559	104566	104577	104577	he	75	“ You ’re being very distracting . ”
104567	104576	104627	104627	she	85	“ I ’ve only started to be distracting , ”
104620	104626	104636	104636	he	75	“ That ’s not fair , ”
104655	104667	104677	104677	Logan	75	“ I ’m trying to have a serious conversation with you . ”
104668	104676	104699	104699	he	75	“ I ’m very serious right now , ”
104705	104728	104733	104733	she	85	“ I ’ve wanted to touch you all day , and I ’m very serious about getting to do so right now . ”
104729	104732	104733	104733	she	85	“ Logan , ”
104743	104753	104769	104769	She	85	“ I wanted to talk about you and me . ”
104761	104768	104772	104772	he	75	“ How good we are together ? ”
104788	104796	104826	104826	his	75	“ I ’ve been thinking . . . ”
104831	104837	104875	104875	She	85	“ What were you thinking ? ”
104886	104901	104912	104912	Those	75	“ I was thinking that . . . I ’ve been unfair to you . ”
104917	104930	104935	104935	she	85	“ You have been unfair . . . to me ? Explain . ”
104931	104934	104940	104940	her	85	“ Yes , ”
104959	105009	105017	105017	He	75	“ Whenever things got a little frightening for me , I ran away . I should have stayed and talked to you . And . . . I ’m sorry . I want this to work between us . I want you . I want to be with you . ”
105029	105032	105033	105033	She	85	“ Logan ? ”
105038	105049	105059	105059	he	75	“ I thought you were going to leave me again . ”
105068	105077	105082	105082	she	85	“ You scared the shit out of me . ”
105078	105081	105082	105082	she	85	“ Sorry , ”
105096	105144	105153	105153	Logan	75	“ I ’m . . . I wo n’t run again . Not without talking to you first . I just . . . it ’s hard to know where I fit in your world when I ’ve always had trouble even fitting in to my own . ”
105145	105152	105160	105160	He	75	“ I know where you fit , ”
105168	105174	105160	105160	He	75	“ Right here , Brontë . ”
105181	105188	105197	105197	he	75	“ I love you , Logan . ”
105189	105196	105197	105197	he	75	“ I love you , too , ”
105209	105236	105160	105160	He	75	“ And I want you to be comfortable with me . If something bothers you , tell me so I can fix it or change it . ”
105237	105297	105363	105363	He	1938	“ I think it ’s me more than you , Logan . I thought that if I came to you and did nothing but sit around your house , I ’d turn into one of those women that you hate . I ’d do nothing but spend your money on shoes and purses all day long , like Danica . ”
105298	105362	105363	105363	He	1938	“ It was n’t that Danica spent my money , love . If you dedicated your life to shopping , you would n’t be able to spend all my money . It was that she valued the money more than she valued our relationship . You ’ve never been like that . You never will be . It ’s not in your nature . ”
105376	105389	105400	105400	Brontë	85	“ That ’s one reason why I fell for you so hard . ”
105390	105399	105414	105414	he	1938	“ I might spend some of your money , ”
105422	105541	105542	105542	She	1940	“ I ’ve realized that I was resenting you for my being a waitress , which is stupid . It is n’t your fault I picked a major that would n’t get me anywhere except waiting tables . It was n’t that you wanted me to make something of myself . It ’s that I was n’t happy with who I was . That does n’t change with or without money , really . But Gretchen woke me up , and I realized that only I can make myself satisfied with my career path . All I know is I that being without you made me unhappy even when I was waiting tables again . So . . . ”
105548	105618	105622	105622	his	1941	“ I want to go back to college and get a graduate degree . Or start a charity to donate books to schools and retirement homes like Gretchen does , but on a bigger scale . Or do both . Or all of it . I ’m not sure . But I want to do something with myself . I ’ll get bored sitting around your apartment all day . ”
105626	105667	105672	105672	She	1942	“ Love , I want you to do whatever makes you happy . And if going back to school helps you — or starting a charity — then we ’ll do both . As long as we do it together . ”
105668	105671	105672	105672	She	1942	“ Together . ”
105678	105691	105696	105696	he	1941	“ I ’m sorry I ’ve made this so difficult . I — ”
105692	105695	105696	105696	he	1941	“ Shhh , ”
105700	105726	105732	105732	she	1942	“ You did n’t . You were just frightened , and I tend to be overbearing and controlling . It ’s part of my nature . ”
105727	105731	105732	105732	she	1942	“ It is , ”
105739	105760	105769	105769	he	1941	“ You ’re used to handling the situation . But a girl likes to be asked every now and then . ”
105761	105768	105794	105794	Logan	75	“ I promise to ask more , ”
105801	105805	105874	105874	he	1941	“ Starting now . ”
105865	105873	105877	105877	his	1941	“ I picked the inscription for you , ”
105883	105889	105894	105894	She	1942	“ Do you like it ? ”
105890	105893	105894	105894	She	1942	“ Inscription ? ”
105922	105939	105940	105940	Her	1942	“ ‘ Every heart hears a song , incomplete , until another heart whispers back . ’ ”
105954	105961	105968	105968	he	1941	“ It ’s beautiful . Ovid ? ”
105962	105967	106033	106033	He	1941	“ Plato , actually , ”
105995	106032	106033	106033	He	1941	“ You ’re my heart , Brontë . I know it feels like such a short time together , but I want to wake up every day with you at my side and in my life . ”
106048	106054	106062	106062	she	1942	“ Will you marry me ? ”
106055	106061	106062	106062	she	1942	“ Of course I will , ”
106072	106079	106088	106088	Logan	75	“ I love you so much . ”
106080	106087	106088	106088	Logan	75	“ I love you , too , ”
106092	106116	107284	107284	he	76	“ Waitress , philosopher , or charitable organizer , I ’ll love you all the same as long as you ’ll be mine . ”
107279	107283	107284	107284	he	76	“ Your friend , ”
107289	107298	107299	107299	She	85	“ The redhead . Tell me about her . ”
107318	107323	107328	107328	He	76	“ You mean Gretchen ? ”
107324	107327	107335	107335	he	76	“ Yes . ”
107343	107350	107299	107299	She	85	“ What is her last name ? ”
107351	107361	107379	107379	She	85	“ Why ? How do you know about Gretchen ? ”
107362	107378	107379	107379	She	85	“ I saw her with you the other day . Tell me more about Gretchen . ”
107384	107399	107421	107422	a man	2212	“ Why should I tell you about Gretchen ? So you can stalk her ? ”
107428	107441	107481	107481	her	85	“ I am an admirer of hers . . . from afar . ”
107442	107447	107481	107481	her	85	“ Like a stalker . ”
107448	107462	107473	107473	Hunter	76	“ Not a stalker . I simply wish to know more about her . ”
107463	107472	107499	107499	He	76	“ That ’s what a stalker would say . ”
107503	107523	107568	107568	Brontë	85	“ Your friend is quite safe from my romantic interests . I simply wish to learn more about her . ”
107564	107567	107587	107587	she	85	“ Oh , ”
107583	107586	107587	107587	she	85	“ Petty , ”
107590	107601	107625	107625	She	129	“ Her last name is Petty . She writes books . ”

107638	107648	107659	107659	she	129	“ Books with other people ’s names on them . ”
107669	107674	107659	107659	she	129	“ A ghost writer ? ”
107678	107691	107675	107675	Brontë	85	“ That ’s right . And Cooper ’s in love with her . ”
107692	107699	107770	107770	He	76	“ Cooper ? Who is Cooper ? ”
107726	107769	None	None	None	None	“ Cooper ’s her friend . It ’s okay , though . He wo n’t make a move . He knows Gretchen is n’t interested in him that way . Gretchen likes guys that are different . She likes to be challenged . ”
