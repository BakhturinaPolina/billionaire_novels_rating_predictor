1      LIA   On any other night, I loved living alone. Fucking loved it. Pants were optional and bras were such an afterthought they might as well not exist. On some days, they were shed at the door and flung onto the couch where they’d hang out for a couple hours while I showered with the door open and walked around naked for no reason. Ninety percent of the time, in my little 18th Street apartment, I was in some state of undress – in a T-shirt and panties or just panties. Sometimes a robe left untied. Sweats and a bra, perhaps? Or maybe nothing at all. It was my personal retaliation for having gone my first twenty-five years without my own bedroom – without my own voice or taste or tiny lick of independence. Thanks to that late start, I loved the freedom of living alone like a normal person loved their mother or spouse. But tonight was one of those nights that made me kind of itch for a roommate. Mostly because I didn’t want to be the one to get up and investigate the bumping and thumping outside in the hall. It was almost 10:30PM – all I wanted at this hour was to play some Sia, pour some wine and risk the safety of my iPad as I read it in the bath. I wanted to paint my toes in Essie’s Chinchilly, sleep by midnight and wake up early to start the custom order of truffles that had to be shipped to a Long Island wedding by Tuesday. So while it was selfish and vaguely bitchy, I pretended not to hear my neighbor struggling out in the hall. More often than not, it was her finicky lock giving her trouble, and generally, I was the one who came to the rescue. But not tonight. “You’ll figure it out, Tess,” I whispered as I finally let myself close my eyes and breathe in the lavender steam. I sighed as I leaned slowly back in the hot water, soaking in the Epsom salts and feeling them start to buzz against my skin. But the second my head touched my bath pillow, a loud noise sounded outside. My eyes flew back open as I waited to hear it again. I breathed out when several seconds of silence passed – even waited another few to be safe. Once I ruled that the coast was clear, I grabbed my glass of wine and relaxed once more. But my back had barely hit the tub before the sound came back louder. Thump! “Tess!” I groaned to myself, sitting up and staring out my bathroom door. I waited to hear a strike three but instead of a thump this time, it was a splintering crash. “Shit!” Water sloshed onto the floor as I immediately jumped up and grabbed my robe, my heart beating fast as I imagined Tess bleeding on the floor in the hall, surrounded by a million shards of glass all because I wouldn’t get out of my bath. Shit, shit, shit. I cursed myself as my feet tracked water all throughout the house till I breathlessly reached the door, my fingers unlatching all three locks at lightning speed before gripping the knob and swinging it wide open. And once the door was open, I stared. Then I stared some more. Holy… what. It wasn’t Tess. I knew that because my eyes hit chest first – wide, hard chest stretching the soft cotton of a heather grey V-neck. I could practically hear my jaw creaking open as my gaze then traveled north to broad shoulders, sculpted collarbones, and a square jaw boasting the kind of dark, trimmed stubble that made my fingers twitch with the need to touch. Shit. I had to catch my breath when our eyes finally locked, feeling legitimately smacked in the face with this stranger’s gorgeousness. He was an absolute wall of muscle and beauty with thick, dark hair and light green eyes and for a moment I forgot where I was, because in what world did a man who looked like this end up at my door? “Hi,” he said with a faint smile. “Lia, right?” My head tilted. And in what world did he somehow know my name? “I…” I failed to sort through all the questions at the tip of my tongue. “Hi,” I finally said, letting go of my mission to magically figure out what was happening. Instead, I waited for him to introduce himself and tell me who he was – whether he had in fact been plucked from the cover of Men’s Health or maybe some steamy billboard for Calvin Klein. But instead he stood there a moment, brows up as his gaze dipped down to my body – and only then did I realize what I barely had on. “Shit,” I hissed, grabbing my robe and wondering how much of me he’d seen before I remembered to actually tie the thing shut. “I should probably be looking away, right?” the stranger asked. With a laugh. I shot daggers at him as I struggled to fix my indecency. “Yes?” I answered brusquely, my cheeks burning as I cinched the sash around my waist. I stared at the stranger as he faced away from me now, chewing a wicked grin back as he palmed that ridiculously square jaw. “What did you see?” I demanded hotly. “Did you see anything?” “I saw a lot. It depends on what your definition of anything is.” “It’s – ” My lips parted but snapped shut. I meant nipple but I wasn’t about to say it. He laughed. “If you mean nipple, my answer is no.” My mouth fell open. “Unless you count what I can see through that wet thing you’re wearing.” I stared down at myself and hastily fanned my hair over my breasts. I wanted to call him out but I couldn’t find my words so glaring back up, I simply snapped, “Who are you?” “Lukas Hendricks. I’m Tess’s brother.” I gaped at him as he turned back to me. “Really?” It was hard to imagine. He looked about a foot taller and wider than her, and I could already tell he shared none of her manners or humility. Fuming, I craned my neck to see past his broad frame, finally spotting the shattered remains of the floor vase that once sat at the end of the hall between our doors. “What just happened?” He peered over his shoulder, letting out a short breath of annoyance. “Right. I was having some trouble with the key. Might’ve swung my bag into the vase and knocked it over.” I stared at the tiny shards of ceramic all over the floor, sobered quickly by the sight of Tess’s prized possession. “That was her favorite vase.” “She’ll forgive me.” I flicked my eyes back to him, doing little to mask my distaste for his nonchalance. “Right. Well, what can I help you with right now?” I asked. His crooked smile acknowledged my irritation. “She said if I had trouble with the lock, I could ask her neighbor.” “Fine,” I said, eager to get on with my night. I thought briefly about getting changed before I helped with the door, but that meant that my bath was over and that my night had gone officially off-course, and I stubbornly refused to entertain that notion. So grabbing my phone off the kitchen counter, I stepped back out in the hall and closed the door, saying nothing to Lukas as I shot Tess a quick message. “What are you doing?” he asked. I took my time to reply. “Confirming with Tess that you’re her brother,” I said. “And not some guy who wants to loot her apartment.” Lukas’s smile was slight, but it teased me something fierce. “Do I look like a robber to you?” No. But I still took the opportunity to check him out. On second glance, he was built much more like an athlete than a model. Maybe a football player or some kind of fighter. The knots of muscle in his arms and shoulders were visible under his shirt, and his dark-wash jeans fit well enough to give me an idea of rock-like thighs under there. My eyes were still on him when I heard him laugh. “It was a rhetorical question but by all means, keep looking.” My cheeks burned but I still managed to shoot him a look. “Are you usually this unpleasant with people you’ve just met?” “How was I being unpleasant?” he challenged. “I just figured if you mentally undressed me, we could call it even for what I saw when you opened the door.” I flashed him another look. “I thought you said you didn’t see any – ” Nope. I cut myself off, refusing to give him the chance to say the world nipple again since clearly, he enjoyed the hell out of making me blush. So clenching my jaw, I muttered, “Never mind,” and faced away again, avoiding his eye even as he tilted his head to try and catch mine. “Hey.” His voice was gentler now but I didn’t look up. “I’m sorry if we got off on the wrong foot.” “It’s fine.” “I know it’s late.” “It is. And I have an early meeting tomorrow.” Petty detail to add but whatever. “I promise
 I’ll be out of your hair soon,” Lukas murmured. A beat of silence passed as he continued watching me. “And at some point, you’ll let me know how to make this night up to you.” I sucked in my bottom lip while pretending to text. Maybe it was the pause or the way he dropped his voice, but his offer somehow sent my mind straight into the gutter. My dormant libido rarely pictured anything racier than a kiss, but tonight it was giving me the image of Lukas making it up to me shirtless, doing things to me in bed I was always too scared to ask for. Ohhh-kay, wow, Lia. No more of that, I scolded myself, touching the hot back of my neck while hastily muttering, “Don’t worry about it.” “Then at least let me buy you a drink.” “Thanks, but I don’t really drink.” “Hence the wine key I saw on your counter.” “That wasn’t mine.” “Are we really playing this game?” “We might be.” “Coffee then?” “I make my own.” “Christ,” he laughed under his breath. “Fine. Nothing I can do then?” When I shook my head, he breathed out in surrender. “Alright. I’d just rather not have you angry with me if I’m going to be your new neighbor.” I paused in the midst of typing and looked up. “Come again?” He smirked at my reaction. “Tess didn’t tell you about France?” “She said something about a trip, but I thought it’d be brief.” “We all thought that, but seems she decided to extend her leave,” Lukas said. “By at least a couple weeks. And I happen to be renovating my apartment for the next month, so I’ll be staying here in the meantime.” I raised my eyebrows. I wanted to ask more about Tess but there was a much more pressing matter. “So you’re saying… you’ll be living across the hall from me. Instead of Tess. For the next month.” “Give or take,” he replied, looking amused with whatever expression I had on my face. “Problem?” “No,” I said, though I could already think of a dozen problems off the top of my head, starting with the noise that came with the personal life of a guy who looked like that. Lukas laughed. “You’re lying. And assuming things about me.” I meant to deny it, but my tongue betrayed me. “Fine, I am.” “Figured.” He folded his arms, treating me to the view of biceps that bulged against the sleeves of his shirt. “Why?” “Because.” I mirrored him with my arms crossed over my chest. “Your sister deliberately rented the two other units in her building to single women who prefer quiet and privacy. We don’t bring parties home at the end of the night and we’re respectful of the fact that this townhouse was built in 1901. The floors creak, the walls are thin and we can easily hear each other if the volume goes above a certain level. That’s why we don’t wear shoes in the house, we don’t slam doors, we don’t have guests past a certain hour and we make sure to be quiet after 10PM.” “Christ.” Lukas’s brows ascended. “Is this a dorm?” “It’s a private home in a quiet neighborhood, and I guess it’s a lifestyle you’ll have to adapt to if you’re staying here.” “Right.” His smooth lips twisted slowly up in a wry smile. “Thing is, this building was actually erected in 1910, and it’s gone through four renovations since, so the floors will probably survive multiple guests and shoes worn in the house. I know that because I own this place. I bought it five years ago, I paid for two of the renovations and I intend to live in it however I see fit, whether or not that includes a certain volume past whatever hour I please.” His wolfish gaze bore into me, dipping only to stare with satisfaction at my parting lips. “I hope that’s alright with you,” he said. “Because it’s going to have to be.” I stared at him. Well, fuck. The force with which I thought the word made it echo in my head as I blinked vacantly at Lukas, paralyzed in shock. This isn’t happening. This isn’t actually happening. I couldn’t process it and I had no response for him. My only move was to stand there in the hall, jaw slack and dripping wet as I gaped at the man who’d waltzed into my life five minutes ago, who’d taken less than that amount of time to threaten the perfect routine I’d carved out and lived blissfully for the past two-and-a-half years. Blood roared in my ears as he gazed with infuriating leisure at me. He was relaxed. I was enraged. He had a smile on his lips. And I had nothing. The silence stretched on till three loud pings sounded from my phone.   TESS: Ahh shoot Lia yes that’s my brother. I’m sorry I didn’t let u know TESS: I’ll be staying in Lyon longer than I thought… Not sure till when but will keep u posted TESS: Luke’s the best though so don’t worry about him at all. He shouldn’t be any trouble.   I read the texts with a mounting fury and a feeling of total helplessness. I didn’t realize how hard my jaw had clenched till I heard my molars squeak against each other. “Got your little confirmation?” Four words and I could hear how thoroughly entertained Lukas was by all of this. God, he was such a prick. Just for sticking that condescending “little” in there, I hated him. Quite possibly despised him. And because of that, I hurried my ass up to help him. I wanted Lukas gone ASAP – out of my sight and out of mind. So with some kind of grunt of a noise, I paced past him, hand out and going to work the second he slapped his key in my palm. Shoving it into the door, I used my other hand to grip the knob, wiggling and jiggling both at once the way I’d learned over the years, as hard as I possibly could till the door finally popped open. Then snatching my robe shut again, I glared up at my new neighbor and despite wanting badly to just flush it down the toilet, I returned his key in his hand. “All good then?” He peeled his eyes off my chest. “Just about.” “Well, I can’t help you with anything beyond your lock.” I stalked past him and reached for my door. “Come in for a minute.” I turned to flash him an incredulous look. “What?” “For a drink,” he laughed. “Just one so I can smooth things over. The way we started doesn’t have to be the way we end, right?” “Sorry,” I answered curtly. “It’s late and I should get back to sleep.” “You were sleeping just now?” “Yes,” I lied. “Soundly till you came along.” He nodded and smirked for a moment, his gaze dipping again. “Pretty wet for someone who was just sleeping.” My cheeks burned. Goddamnit. I had no comeback but at this point, I also had no interest in further conversation with Lukas Hendricks aside from perhaps calling him out for the arrogant asshole he was, especially as he leaned back all relaxed, head tilted up to show off that perfect jaw. God, he so deserved to be cursed out. But that reaction would only serve to amuse him and I refused to let him win again so breathing deep, I kept it as classy as I could. “Goodnight, Lukas,” I bit out as I turned and pushed open my door – rather, I tried. But the knob refused to turn. I was locked out.            2      LIA   So this is happening. This is a real thing that is happening. My head spun as I tried to process the turn of events. I’d met Lukas ten minutes ago and started hating him shortly after. He’d casually announced his plans to ruin the peace of my home life and I’d shot him a variety of death looks to refrain from cussing him out. In short, we’d gotten off to a rocky start. Yet here I was. Alone with him in his apartment at 11PM, wearing nothing but a soaked robe that still refused to unglue itself from my skin. “You know what you should do? You should hate-fuck him.” “Sara!” I pounced on my phone, which I’d set at the foot of the bed in the upstairs guest room. “You’re on speakerphone because I’m changing, so don’t say anything crazy!” I hissed, lowering the volume even more. Since Tess was no longer answering texts and I had no clue where she kept my spare key, I’d gone with plan B, which was to borrow her clothes, call a car and rush to Sara’s while the key situation was being resolved – because considering my pulse had not stopped racing since I first laid eyes on him, there was no way in hell that I could survive another ten minutes with Lukas, let alone a fucking sleepover with him. “Why not though?” Sara asked. “Is this a serious question?” I whispered furiously as I yanked on the brand new sweater and leggings taken from Tess’s guest room closet. I was relieved to hear that everything inside was set for donation – not so relieved to discover that nothing was bigger than a size four. “Shit, woman, you might need to come here and drop off a hoodie and sweats. I don’t have a bra or panties and I’m pretty sure I’m stretching everything see-through!” “Good. Walk downstairs, do a twirl, ask him how you look. You’ll be having sex in minutes.” “Sara – ” I snatched my phone up and jabbed it promptly off speaker. “Hi. Can I talk to my best friend, please? The one who knows that I don’t do that sort of thing? Like – ever?” “Yes, hi, it’s me. I know you don’t do that sort of thing – in fact, I know for how long you haven’t done that sort of thing,” Sara mused. “But you said literally yesterday and the day before that you need to get back into the dating game at some point or you’ll never have a family.” “I only said that because of the cute baby clothes at H&M!” “And because you keep getting orders for weddings of brides who are several years younger than you.” “Damn, woman. Take it easy.” “I’m quoting you,” Sara laughed. “So all I’m saying is you gotta start somewhere and if there were any night to break the dry spell, wouldn’t it be tonight? You were literally dripping wet when you met this alleged babe and ten minutes later, you’re getting conveniently naked in his apartment. Also, in the three years that I’ve known you, I’ve heard you describe a man as ‘crazy hot’ like, three times tops and two of those times we were watching a movie.” “Inception,” I murmured. “All those tailored suits.” “Exactly. And that still averages to like, once a year,” Sara pointed out. “Yet in the past eight texts
 and two minutes of conversation with me you’ve dropped ‘crazy hot’ at least three times and there was also mention of…” She trailed off while undoubtedly scrolling through our texts. “‘Pecs the size of my face.’ So… maybe all this is a sign? I mean it really feels like God’s dropping some major hints tonight.” I snorted as I went over to the mirror and stared at my reflection. “First off, leave God out of this mess. Second, getting back into the dating game and having sex with my womanizing prick of a neighbor are two very different things.” “How do you know he’s a womanizer?” “I looked at him, Sara. And then I heard him talk.” “Maybe he’s not as bad as you think.” “I think I’m going to spend the next month listening to him take a new girl home every night.” “Because you’re a pessimist when it comes to men and relationships and all that jazz. But you are attracted to him, right?” “Physically.” I trudged toward the bed and plopped myself down. “But I feel like I had no choice in the matter. He’s like… aggressively good-looking. I swear every single muscle on his body is an attention whore. They keep flexing and rippling when all he’s doing is standing there and crossing his arms. It’s stupid.” “Well, it still counts,” Sara laughed. “So I say try and end this night on a positive note. I mean if he’s related to Tess, there’s gotta be a nice guy somewhere under there.” “I wouldn’t count on it.” “Well, I would. Matter of fact – I’ll bet you your cab ride that if you stick around and talk it out with him, you’ll find there’s actually a decent person under all that sexy muscle,” Sara said, ever the optimist. “It beats hating your home life for the next four weeks, right? You know I’m right.” “Yeah, yeah, fair enough. I’m calling a car in about five, okay? See you soon,” I sighed before hanging up, taking in a deep breath and heading for the door. But I was barely halfway down the stairs when I stifled a gasp and ducked behind the wall. Because standing at the front door with Lukas was a beautiful blonde – in a trench coat pulled open to show off her bright, red lingerie. “What the fuck?” I whispered under my breath, stumbling backward and contorting my face over the fact that I was right. I was fucking right! I’d barely just hung up with Sara and I’d already proved the different-woman-a-night theory true. Crouched at the top of the steps, I clasped a hand over my mouth, leaning against the wall to listen into the murmured conversation. I was expecting the filthiest of dirty talk but to my surprise, when I heard Lukas speak, his voice was steely – tinged with more than a hint of annoyance. “I told you not to come.” “You also told me you wouldn’t open the door if I did, yet here we are.” “Noelle, go home.” “But Nadia and I wanted to give you a housewarming gift. She’ll be here in a couple minutes – and she’ll be wearing your favorite little red thing. You always prefer us in matching colors, right?” No fucking way. And just like that, my different-woman-a-night-theory became the two-different-women-a-night-at-the-same-time theory. Oh my God. Fuck my life, I cursed as I pictured a month of waking up to rowdy sex parties and choruses of orgasmic moans. “Lukie…” “This is not a drill, Noelle. I need you to go home.” “What the fuck, Lukas. Do not embarrass me tonight,” the woman hissed, though she promptly softened her voice. “I need your cock now. I’ve been wet for you all day and we might as well take advantage of poor Tessie being gone, right?” she simpered mockingly. “You know how much she whines and bitches when you fuck her friends.” I peeked past the wall in time to see Lukas clenching his jaw at her remark. “Goodnight,” he said, closing the door. She pushed it back open with surprising force. “Lukas – ” “I have someone over,” he said. My eyebrows jumped high as I watched Noelle stop and stare with hurt. But she recovered quickly. “Well… if I don’t hear her she must not be very much fun,” she scoffed. “And if you haven’t taken your dick out yet, she must not be all that cute.” Lukas’s laugh was curt. “Oh, but she’s actually one of those rare finds that pulls off cute and sexy at the same time,” he said low, barely loud enough for me to hear. “And trust me, my cock’s been hard as a rock since the second I laid eyes on her tonight but I’m trying out the gentleman thing for once,” he added, his voice an irritated rasp. “That enough detail for you to head home now or would you like to hear about how fucking perfect her tits are? ‘Cause I could go on and on.” My jaw fell into my lap. And in seconds, Noelle was gone, her angry heels clacking audibly down the hall even after Lukas closed the door. My heart hammering, I waited another ten seconds, giving Noelle time to exit the building before I got up and flew downstairs, making a beeline for the door that Lukas leaned tiredly against. He exhaled a breath that was half-groan upon spotting me. “Something tells me you’re displeased.” I meant to ignore his dry remark but I couldn’t help myself. “Yeah – sorry I’m not completely charmed that you went into pretend-detail about having sex with me just to get rid of some poor girl.” “Poor girl she is not, but do enlighten me on how I went into detail about having sex with you. If I recall correctly, I admitted to my dick being in my pants all night.” “Well, I didn’t need to hear you talk so explicitly about everything else,” I snapped. “What did I say?” I rolled my eyes. “I’m not going to repeat it just so you can hear me say bad words.” “‘Bad words’? What are we, five?” “Fine.” I crossed my arms and stared in disbelief at him. “I didn’t need to hear all about how hard you were or how… how…” His lips turned up in a wicked grin. “How perfect I think your tits are?” “Oh my God,” I said in his face as I physically pushed him off the door to let myself out. Holy shit. Mistake, I swallowed hard. Never ever touch his abs again, I scolded myself, dizzy over how absurdly hard his muscles just felt under my palms. “Right, well, see you around,” Lukas called humorously down the hall. My heart slammed as I fought back the urge to respond or so much as look back. And I succeeded, but the second I was out the door of the townhouse, my fingers flew to send Sara the rare all-caps text.   ME: HE IS AS BAD AS I THOUGHT AND YOU OWE ME 10000 CABS!!! POUR TWO GLASSES OF WINE I’LL BE THERE IN 10!!!!              3      LUKAS   I leaned back in my chair, staring out the window into reception. It’s a two-way mirror, I wanted to tell the new girl. It was her first day and my guess was that she’d yet to catch on to the architecture at the office, considering she checked her reflection in front of me repeatedly – everything from her teeth to her cleavage before knocking on my door with yet another question she could’ve Googled. To be fair, I usually had patience for that kind of thing. There was generally nothing annoying about an attractive woman leaning over my desk to point at a memo she didn’t actually want me to look at. Eyes on tits – that was the sole purpose of those visits and I rarely minded playing along. But my interest was low today. Twelve hours later and I was still a fucking animal thinking about that painfully sexy neighbor of mine. I hadn’t stopped since last night. Her image was already seared into my brain, starting with the one I got when she first opened the door – dripping wet and barely fucking dressed. I was lucky her brown eyes locked right onto mine or the first thing I’d have looked at were her tits. They were unreal even before they started bouncing for me as she jiggled that key in my door. Fuck, what a view that was. I couldn’t get enough of that memory – Lia wrestling my lock with such fire and fury that she didn’t care about her robe falling open again. The girl hated me enough to nearly expose herself while trying to get rid of me. Technically unfortunate but also the hottest thing I’d ever seen in my life. All I could think of as I watched her was pinning her body up on the wall, ripping that robe wide open and sucking on her nipples till she begged to be fucked. “Christ,” I groaned aloud. As if sensing my dick was hard, my assistant suddenly knocked. “Everything okay in here?” Noelle asked, cocking her blonde head at me. “Everything’s fine,” I answered as she sat her tight ass at the edge of my desk, crossing one long leg over the other. She rarely ever came in without pulling that move and I rarely ever stopped myself from watching her skirt ride up her thighs. But as the case had been all morning, I had trouble keeping interest. “Stressed out?” Noelle frowned. “You’ve seemed off all morning. Are you worried about Tess?” I studied her, hoping she remembered nothing of last night so we could bypass that conversation. “She’s in good hands right now so, no. No more than usual.” “Good,” Noelle murmured, her blue eyes drifting out my window. She was a childhood friend of my sister’s. It was the only reason I hired her. Three years and a hundred desk fucks later, I was beginning to regret it, though not enough to fire her. It was my fault for repeatedly mixing business with pleasure and Noelle was a good asset to have when clients needed a pretty girl to coax them into putting down the offer, even if the house was a million or ten out of the budget. Business-wise, she made perfect sense. Of course more than that, I refused to let Cam poach anyone from my staff. I’d keep the most insubordinate and worthless intern if I knew my former partner was interested in hiring. In fact, I’d buy or claim anything he so much as looked at. After what he’d pulled, I was eager to ensure the struggle of his everyday life. Julian wouldn’t let me kill him, so it was the least I could do. “Lukas…” I blinked back into focus, fearing the way Noelle said my name because that trail-off always preceded some version of we need to talk. “About last night.”
 I clicked my pen shut. “We don’t need to discuss that. Is there anything work-related you want to address?” She blinked as if I’d just thrown a drink in her face. “No?” “How’s the new girl doing?” “I’m training her to keep you as happy as I do,” Noelle smiled, tilting her head. “Anything specific you’d like her to know? How hard you like your massages?” I let my stare linger on her for another second before returning to my screen. “Tell her that building security knows not to let Cam in, so if he calls and threatens to come by she doesn’t have to keep bringing it to my attention.” Noelle bristled at the strictly work-related conversation. “Fine. I’ll let her know,” she muttered, crossing her arms as she rose to her heeled feet. She stared in a hard silence at me for several moments but when I didn’t look up at her, she broke. “I’m horny, Lukas. Do you want to fuck me right now?” “Have I given you any indication that I do?” “Are you being this much of a prick because it’s that time of the year?” she countered, going from zero to sixty as she was known to do. “For Christ’s sake, Lukas, just go away for a month like Tess does. Don’t make the rest of us miserable.” The blank stare I gave her masked how thoroughly pissed I was. “Go back to work, Noelle.” “Let me make you feel good.” “No.” She actually snarled in response. Like a cat. Still, she put on her best walk for me as she exited the office. I knew because I heard her huff when she got to the door, presumably when she looked back to see me already on the phone, my attention rapt as I read the new text on my screen. I didn’t recognize the number it belonged to, but it didn’t take much to figure it out.  Hi. I got your number from Tess. She said she told you where my key was this morning and that you brought it to work. If you leave it at reception and text me your office address, I’ll be in and out quickly to pick it up. Thank you.  I smirked. Lia’s entire message was a thinly veiled way of saying that she preferred to do this exchange without seeing me, but I had no intention of leaving her key with Noelle so the reply I gave was simply that of my address. And within twenty minutes, the new girl’s voice sounded on my intercom. “Mr. Hendricks? Lia Pope is here to see you?” My eyes flew up and landed instantly on Lia as she stood at reception, enduring whatever interrogation she was getting from Noelle. Damn. I dragged my hand down the lower half of my face. Wet and indecent had been an undeniably good look, but apparently dry and clothed was just as sexy on her. She wore a loose sweater and jeans – nothing I’d never seen on other women but on her, I couldn’t look away. The creamy color of her top brought out the sun-kissed glow of her skin and the snug fit of her jeans gave me the view of a perfectly round ass I hadn’t fucking known to look at last night. Christ. I tilted my head to take in the side view of her lithe but curvy body as she leaned over reception, her tits just resting on the counter and making me wish I was that very glass surface. “Mr. Hendricks?” “Yes, send her in,” I finally said, watching Noelle glare as the new girl gave Lia the green light to enter. I willed my dick down as I got up to meet her. “Nice receptionist you have,” Lia greeted me sarcastically, arms crossed and staring straight ahead as I closed the door behind her. I frowned. “What’d she say?” “Nothing overtly unfriendly but she was definitely very suspicious of my intentions here.” I glanced out at Noelle, who was still staring into my office with unmasked contempt. I knew well what she was thinking – that I’d already stripped Lia naked, bent her over my desk and buried my cock deep inside her. Nothing I hadn’t pictured myself but still deeply inaccurate. “Apologies on her behalf.” I resumed my seat behind my desk. “She shouldn’t have been so unprofessional.” “Mm, well, I’m sure she’s just following your lead.” “And what is it you’re trying to say with that?” Lia’s arms remained crossed as she shrugged. “Just that her unprofessionalism is most likely a reflection of yours.” “Is this about the fact that you saw her at my apartment last night?” “Yes. And you told her that you had a woman over, which led her to be suspicious of me when I walked in here looking for you.” “Why do you care what she thinks?” “Because I do.” “That’s not a reason.” Lia glared. “Because.” She clenched her teeth. “I hate that once I get my key from you and leave, I have to do a walk of shame from your office to the elevator despite the fact that nothing went on in here. And don’t pretend that’s not the case, Lukas, it’s crystal clear what your receptionists think is happening in this room as we speak. Clearly, it happens often enough around here.” My lip curled at her judgment. “I can assure you it doesn’t. Contrary to whatever assumption you’re running with, my need to fuck can generally wait till I have time to step out of the office.” “At which point you go home and make your neighbors miserable?” “You’re really hung up on this idea of me, aren’t you?” “Well, just judging from the conversation I overheard last night, you host exactly the kind of… late-night activity I imagined you might. And we’re all adults so that’s fine. All I ask is for you to be considerate as far as the noise level goes, especially on the nights that you decide to take… multiple girls home.” “In all fairness, one can easily make as much noise as two. Just depends on the girl and the night.” “Wow. Thanks for sharing but I had no desire to know that.” “Why? Because the idea of sex makes you uncomfortable?” Her eyebrows flashed. “No?” she said, instantly defensive. “What would make you say that?” I leaned back. “Well, to start, you desperately avoid saying ‘sex.’ You think ‘hard’ is a bad word and you use weird euphemisms like ‘late night activity’ to keep your speech strictly non-sexual. As far as I’m concerned, that’s some damning evidence.” “That means nothing.” “Then say it.” “Say what?” “Sex.” Lia uncrossed her arms and slammed her hands onto her hips. “Sex,” she scoffed, throwing in a shrug to convey nonchalance. “There you have it. That work for you?” “In a sentence.” “This is not an erotic spelling bee, Lukas.” I laughed. “Pretend it is.” “You’re ridiculous.” “And you’re the one who’s bothered by what I said, so just do it, Lia. You know you want to.” She gaped at me, so visibly in awe of my nerve that I was sure she was about to turn on her prissy ballet flats and storm out of my office. But instead, she surprised me, tapping her foot twice, inhaling deep then breathing out, “Fine. You want it in a sentence, then here it is: You. Have. Sex,” she enunciated. “You probably have a lot of sex. I suspect you’re going to have more sex than I’m willing to hear every night. You love talking about sex – so much so that you’re forcing me to talk about sex. Everything out of your mouth sounds like sex. Sex,” Lia finished breathlessly, crossing her arms over her chest. “There. That was at least four sentences. You happy now?” “That’s certainly a way to put it.” “You did not just do that.” “Do what?” “Grab your dick in front of me.” I raised my eyebrows. “I wasn’t grabbing it, I was adjusting it under my desk and you actually weren’t supposed to see that, so apologies.” The groan she let out was curious. It sounded desperate with a tinge of something I couldn’t interpret so I wasn’t sure why it turned me the fuck on but it did. Paired with the way she thrust her hands in her hair and I was an animal again. I wanted her. So badly that I was sure she could feel it as the silence stretched between us. “Lukas, my key,” she finally said, her voice sounding small and exhausted. She muttered “thanks” when she took the envelope from my hand but upon ripping it open, she promptly dropped the key on the floor, tripping on nothing as she tried picking it up. “I got it,” she said quickly, flustered when I rounded my desk to help her up. “Are you sure?” I laughed when I spotted the shoes she’d fallen out of. “Lia, those look at least two sizes too big for you.” “I borrowed them from a friend,” she muttered in frustration. “I was barefoot when I left your house last night.” “Fuck, seriously? I’m so sorry.” “It’s okay,” she murmured softly, reluctantly accepting my hand for balance. I was silent as I felt her soft skin in my palm and my pulse quickened as I watched her bend over to slip into her shoes. Her big eyes were at the level of my chest but slowly, they drifted south, shy but unwavering till her stare landed below my belt. Right on my cock. Whoa. Her cheeks brightened but to my surprise, she didn’t look away. In fact, her grip on my hand tightened just slightly as she swallowed and stared, so fucking irresistible with that hypnotized look on her face. Or maybe it was the other way around. Maybe she had some spell cast on me because in seconds, I went from half-hard to rock solid and ready to just slam her against my body. But in a flash, she was back on her feet, lashes fluttering and chest heaving as she stammered. “I, um – thanks for the key, Lukas,” Lia stumbled breathlessly, a flurry of white sweater, blue jeans and honey locks as she rushed the hell out my door. And just like that I was standing in the middle of my office, my cock throbbing out of control as I asked myself what the hell just happened. I had no goddamned clue. But whatever it was, I wanted more of it.            4      LIA   “Lia, no. You did what?” “Shhh!” I hissed as Sara practically climbed over the table to hear me say it again. It was Monday and since I’d called off yesterday’s visit due to my late start on work, we’d convened for a makeup hang at the coffee shop across the street from my building. It was a tiny spot with a fireplace that I normally loved for its coziness but today it felt like every word of our conversation was bouncing off the walls. “To be fair, it
 started with me falling out of your giant clown shoes – ” “I’m four inches taller than you!” “ – and then it ended with me holding onto his hand so I could put them back on my feet and, um… well, because of where my eye line was, I guess I kind of – ” “Stared at the giant, pulsing hard-on he had snaked down his pants?” “Yes. That.” Sara howled. “Oh my God! This is the best day of my life.” “Stop it!” I chucked a piece of cake at her. “You’re having way too much fun here. As my best friend, it is your job to absorb all my embarrassing confessions and never speak of them again.” “I’m sorry, I just…” Sara wiped tears from the corners of her eyes. “I’m just so happy someone finally woke up ol’ Gert.” I buried my face in my hands. “Oh my God. Make it stop.” By Gert, Sara meant Gertrude. And by Gertrude she meant my libido. I wasn’t sure who had come up with the nickname – it could very well have been me – but it was a reference to how my sex drive had become an elderly woman as of late. Since leaving my crappy little hometown and the ten-year relationship that had wrecked me from the inside out, she’d become weak. Inactive. She’d been briefly alive when I first moved to the city, thanks to the daily sight of beautiful people on the sidewalks and the subways and basically everywhere. But after three months of me being obsessed with Tinder but too scared to move past the messaging stage, she finally retreated back into safety and decided it was best to concentrate on a career first. That was the story of Gert. But as of last week – as of Lukas Hendricks – she’d made a grand, lip-smacking return. “Stop what?” Sara’s giggling brought me back to Earth. “My references to Gertrude or the fact that she’s suddenly back and completely out of control?” “Both?” I replied weakly. “Sara, I mean it, stop laughing. I hate this. It’s like a switch flipped in my body and now I get these random thoughts and fantasies that make me blush and squirm and forget what I’m saying while I’m like, paying for coffee. And it sucks. It makes me feel like a mess.” “Oh, bubs,” Sara pouted. “I’m sure it feels weird, but it’s not a bad thing. I mean it was great that you were able to shut off this side of you while getting your business on its feet, and I’m sure a part of it had to do with all the shit you went through with Ritchie, but Gertrude was bound to come back at some point – especially after three years without sex.” I sighed. “True.” I had a feeling most would flinch at that brutal honesty but I barely did. My celibacy was just a part of me at this point – a casual thing I carried with me day-to-day, like an old purse. “But in my defense, it’s more like two-and-a-half years,” I said, though I realized once the words left my lips that they were wrong. I’d started dating Ritchie in high school when I was fifteen. We broke up two-and-a-half years ago, when I was twenty-five. But we’d stopped having sex long before that so actually, it was hard to calculate the true length of my dry spell. Whatever it was though, I was at peace with it. I was convinced I’d traded it in to finally find myself after growing up locked in a relationship. So I truly never minded Gert. At least not till now. Now, she was distracting me and filling my head with dirty thoughts that wouldn’t go away, which was less than ideal considering the amount of work I had coming up. I had to secure an investor, get some distribution and most importantly, start shopping for a space to open up my brick and mortar. It was about to be a busy year and I couldn’t afford to spend it dizzy with some infatuation. Whatever this was, I had to fix it. “Sara, do you think…” I tilted my head slowly. “Is it possible that I’m not actually that attracted to Lukas?” I asked. She cocked an inquisitive eyebrow. “Please detail this theory.” “Well, maybe he’s just the one who broke the seal,” I said, my eyes getting wider as I got the ball rolling. “I mean he was the first remotely sexual encounter I had in years, so of course he got stuck in my head. Right? But I don’t actually like him. I’m sure if I went on a date with someone else and went dancing, maybe flirted it up a bit, I’d completely forget about Lukas.” “But then what about the new guy? Wouldn’t you get attached to him?” Sara asked. “Not at all! I’d pick some nice, safe guy. Like, a starter boyfriend who wouldn’t get me too fired up or crazy. He’d interest me just enough and because of that, I’d still have enough brain space to concentrate on work and stuff. I could go on a couple dates, get Lukas out of my head and be totally done – right?” I asked eagerly, breathless and unblinking as I awaited Sara’s verdict. But she chewed on her straw, seemingly thinking hard as she narrowed those catlike eyes at me. “It might work.” “Yes!” “It would definitely be a new distraction.” “Yes!” I clapped my hands. “Though plain having sex with someone would do the trick even faster.” “What?” I slowed down and cocked my head at her. “No… Sara. Why –? You just took this in a whole other direction.” “No, I didn’t. I just expanded on it. It’s still your idea. Just advanced.” “Oh, well excuse me,” I laughed. “Please, educate me then, Ms. Hanna.” “Fine.” Sara wound her mane of black hair into a giant topknot. “To put it simply, Lukas woke up your libido and now you’re crazy horny. Right?” She stuck a pen into her hair to keep it in place. “You want to get rid of these feelings but not with him, because you’re afraid of getting attached to someone that hot.” She glanced down at her phone. “And judging from just the picture on his website,” she flashed the image at me, “he looks like he’d be pretty good in bed, which would only get you more attached. Right?” “Right. Can you stop Googling him though?” “Yes. But the point is.” Sara kept her eyes down as she twiddled away on her phone. “A candlelit dinner isn’t going to be enough for you to forget a babe of this caliber. You need actual sex to get over him. Good, hot sex with a nice, boring guy. That way you’ll quench the thirst without getting attached, you’ll stop associating anything remotely sexual with Lukas and then you’ll finally go back to living your merry life – am I not right?” I blinked and stared. “I mean it makes sense. It’s just weird to think about having sex for the first time in so long. Though I guess if I’m going to do it…” My gaze floated elsewhere as I sighed. “I guess it should be with someone I don’t really care about. As horrible as it sounds.” “It doesn’t sound horrible, it sounds practical and efficient and it’s exactly why I keep Jeff around,” Sara said, popping a piece of cake into her mouth. She was referring to her copy editor at work. He was cute enough. Nowhere as cute as Sara, of course, but that was the point. He was already at the office, he wasn’t someone to obsess over and he got the job done so she could get her job done. Otherwise, her firecracker of a libido – pretty sure we’d nicknamed it Roxanne – would hold her brain hostage till she gave it some attention. Sara shrugged. “Sometimes you just gotta feed the craving and move on.” I nodded quietly, trying to figure out if this was actually a good idea or if my mind was simply that far gone. Not that it mattered anymore. “Welp, this might just be our solution then.” I threw my hands in the air. “I guess this means I need to find myself a date.” “Done,” Sara gave a final tap on her phone and smirked. “What do you think I’ve been doing the past two minutes?” she asked, flashing me her glowing screen. On it was my new, thoroughly filled out dating profile, all ready to go with a full bio and picture. I raised my eyebrows and nodded. “I would yell at you for being creepy but that was impressively time-efficient.” “How a workaholic rolls. Not that I have to tell you,” Sara said, sliding her phone across the table. “Anyway, check him out. He’s cute and fit and he has literally none of the same interests as you. He hates dogs.” “What?” “And chocolate.” “Stop.” “I know. Fuckin’ weirdo, right?” Sara said excitedly. “But he has nice arms so you’ll have great sex and be over him in a jiff. It’s gonna be great.” I burst out laughing, in disbelief of the fact that I was actually considering this. But I was, and I didn’t mind it. I’d always been a late bloomer. I graduated college at twenty-four, got my first apartment at twenty-five and only started discovering my own hobbies and interests at twenty-six. Of course it would take till twenty-seven to figure out sex and dating. It was just how I rolled. “Alright, fuck it. Let’s do it,” I said, grabbing Sara’s phone and messaging the cute dog hater. But just as I finished, my eyes were drawn to the well-groomed, dark blonde man in the expensive suit behind Sara. He’d been sitting with his back facing us this whole time, but now he was standing up and peering at me with a ghost of a grin on his lips. I rolled my eyes as he tossed back his espresso, suspecting that he had eavesdropped and was laughing at our conversation. But my stomach quickly turned as I watched him exit the shop and cross the street, walking leisurely toward my building and up the stairs before getting quickly buzzed in. I felt the blood drain from my face as I stared out the window and muttered, “Shit.” Sara frowned, glancing over her shoulder. “What?” “Nothing. I just really hope that guy is Rachel’s new boyfriend,” I said, referring to my neighbor on the first floor. “Why?” “Because if he’s not, then he’s a friend of Lukas’s.” I closed my eyes as Sara’s went wide. “And he just heard every word we just said.”            5      LUKAS   “Julian said you do most of your business with professional athletes?” the brunette in my lap twirled her ponytail as she sipped a vodka soda. I nodded as I worked on my third Scotch of the night. I may or may not have started drinking early with Emmett before meeting Julian for cigars at The Pike
 on Park Ave. After several rounds, the plan had been to come back here to catch the game before dinner but the second we opened the front door, the girl on the first floor popped her head right out. Rachel or Rochelle – one of those two. After introducing herself, she introduced the six or seven friends she had over for a girl’s night out. And just like that, girl’s night out became a girl’s night in my apartment because Emmett decided to open his dumb mouth and invite everyone over. “Not most of my business,” I answered the question vaguely. “But some.” “Wow.” Ponytail ran my hand up and down her thighs. “You must make millions off of them.” “They’re good clients to have,” I said. It was the least revealing answer possible but it still drew another few girls to the couch like flies to honey. Straddling the armrest now was a leggy redhead who casually grabbed my free hand and dropped it into her lap. “I heard you hang out with the New York Empires. That’s so cool – I love baseball,” she purred as across the room, Emmett grinned at me, toasting his lowball of whiskey at my two handfuls of thigh. Combined with the buzz of Scotch and cigars, it helped. It didn’t erase the memory of Lia’s big eyes on my cock, but at least it was something – especially since she’d been avoiding me like the goddamn plague since that day. “Do you work out with them or something? I mean it looks like you do.” My answers were on autopilot now, my tongue easily fielding the flirty questions till I spotted Julian coming back into the apartment. I was still talking when I flashed him a death look. We’d both agreed to entertain the girls for Emmett’s newly single sake, but Julian had taken the coward’s way out by disappearing for forty minutes. So as payback, I announced his arrival to the girls on the couch, prompting them to burst into a round of applause as he angled his way back to us. “Welcome back, Julian!” they chorused in uniform baby voices. He visibly cringed, never having been great at faking interest where he had none. I snorted as he proceeded to ignore his cooing admirers and take a seat on the table across from me, wearing a full grin that suited Emmett much more than it did him. “What’s going on?” I asked suspiciously. “Where the hell did you go?” “You’ll thank me in a second,” he muttered before turning to the girls. “Give us a minute,” he said briskly. As they pouted and left, he caught a beer lobbed over from Emmett then turned back to me with the stoic expression I was more used to from him. “What’s your neighbor’s name again?” “You tell me. Rochelle or Racquel. Could even be Rachel.” “Not that one. The one you keep talking about,” Julian said as he opened his beer. I groaned. “Fuck. Lia.” “Right.” Julian leaned forward on his knees and took a swig from the bottle. “Fun fact: she hasn’t had sex in three years and she’s planning on fucking some sad sack to get you out of her head.” My brows lifted then pulled tight as I stared at him for what felt like a full minute. “What the fuck are you talking about?” I finally asked. “I heard her and a friend downstairs at the coffee place. There’s a coffee place across from your apartment with surprisingly decent espresso.” “I don’t need a review of the espresso right now, asshole, I need details on what the hell you just dropped on me.” A sudden sense of urgency rattled my bones. “When is she meeting this guy? She’s about to go home with him now?” “Easy.” Julian pulled me back down. “I don’t think so but you also better not go Cam on him. You’ve known this girl one day. Try to wait till you’re dating before you break any arms for her.” “That’s not going to happen. I just don’t appreciate when others reap the benefits of my work.” “Shit. What did Cam do now?” Emmett asked upon joining us. “We’re actually not talking about him,” Julian replied with amusement. “We’re talking about some guy who gets to claim Lukas’s prize. He got the neighbor all worked up and now she’s trying to forget him by having mediocre sex with someone else.” “Oh, shit.” Emmett faced me with a look of gravity more befitting of an emergency room. “So you got her pussy wet and some other dude gets to fuck it?” “That’s an extra charming way of putting it but yes, apparently.” “Well, shit, that’s not fair. Go find her,” Emmett implored. I turned to Julian. “She was still at the café when you left?” “Yes.” “Then hold down the fort while I’m gone,” I said, getting up and handing Emmett my drink. Two fingers of Scotch and he shot it like vodka. I had to stare at him as Julian handed me my keys. “Bring her friend back if you can,” he said, already back to work emails on his phone. “She looked better from the back than any of the girls here look now.” “I’ll try,” I said. “You piece of shit,” I added as I headed for the door. Since I spotted Ponytail and Redhead on my way, I whispered for them to Google Julian Hoult and waited around till I could witness them bursting into shrieks over the fact that he’d just bought the New York Empires. I swung the door open just as the stampede of heels clattered over to him, grinning from ear to ear with a feeling of petty justice. And right as I ambled out into the hall, I saw Lia coming up the stairs. My smile faltered only because I wasn’t prepared for what she was wearing – a casual black dress that went down to her ankles. Thin straps to show off those gorgeous shoulders and an even thinner belt to cinch that waist. Topping it all off was her hair piled loosely at the top of her head, a couple strands falling down to frame her face. I couldn’t stop staring even when she caught my eye. “Why are you already shaking your head at me?” I laughed. “Variety of reasons,” Lia said slowly, a hint of suspicion in her voice as she walked toward with me with her arms crossed and eyes narrowed. “Care to share?” “Well, we can start with the extremely loud party you’re having right now.” I glanced at my door then back at her. “Right. I figured I’d made the worst possible impression on you already. Might as well go all in.” She almost laughed but bit it back. “Seriously, Lukas, what’s going on in there?” she asked, stopping two feet from me. I eyed the distance between us. “Well, I came in around eight with two friends, and Rochelle from downstairs ambushed me with about six or seven of hers. Emmett took it upon himself to invite them up, so apologies on his behalf.” “I see.” Lia studied me. I grinned because I knew she was trying to figure out if I knew – if the guy she’d spotted at the café was in fact my friend, and if he did in fact tell me everything he heard her say. But instead of confessing that, I let her play detective. She was too fucking adorable biting that lip and squinting at me, somehow pissed off, embarrassed and playful at once. “And this friend Emmett… what does he look like?” “Why? Interested?” I teased. “Maybe. Just answer my question.” “Alright.” I blew air out of my mouth as I thought about it. I’d known Emmett nearly ten years, but I could probably name the Empires twenty-five-man roster faster than I could physically describe him. “I don’t know. He’s my height. Same dark hair as me. His eyes are brown or blue. I think? I think they’re brown. I’m not totally sure.” “Alright, don’t hurt yourself,” Lia snorted, making me grin. “You mentioned another friend though,” she said, shy again as she chewed the corner of her mouth. “What does he look like? Did he by chance leave your apartment at some point tonight?” Fuck. I meant to play this out longer but I couldn’t help the smile I broke right into. “Oh my God, he told you!” Lia immediately groaned, burying her face in her hands. “Alright, hey.” I laughed as I went over and tried to pull her hands off of her face. “Lia. It’s not a big deal.” “Yes, it is a big deal.” “Why?” I guided her to lean on the wall. I took a second to adjust when she finally dropped her hands from her face because Jesus Christ, she was gorgeous. There was a glow to her cheeks and her bright eyes were even brighter all big and wet. For how hard the woman got me, she definitely knew how to soften my mostly black heart. “Come on, Lia. What are you even upset about?” “Are you serious?” Her voice was small but commanding. “Just say it back to me, Lukas. Tell me everything you heard, exactly as you heard it.” “I heard that you were downstairs with a friend. As far as dating goes, you haven’t been with anyone in awhile and you were talking about… changing that. To get your mind off of me.” “Oh, so now you’re the one speaking in euphemisms?” she rolled her eyes. I smirked at the return of her attitude. “Fine – you haven’t fucked anyone in three years, Lia, and your plan is to fuck someone else so you don’t give into your temptation to fuck me. And if we’re being blunt here, that kind of fucking pisses me off.” A spark lit her eyes. “Oh really. Why? You think I owe you sex just because you saw me half-naked the first day we met? Because you forced me to think about sex because all you could talk about was sex?” “Did I force you to stare at my cock the other day?” Her jaw dropped. “Fine.” I stepped back with a laugh when I realized she’d pushed me. “I looked. I was curious. And interested. So what?” she huffed. “I still reserve the right to sleep with whoever else I want.” “No.” I stepped forward. “That’s not how it’s going to work.” “Shut up! Are you really going to be that person who’s known me a week and tries to tell me who I’m allowed to fuck?” “No, I’m going to be that person who fucks you and gives you what you need because you know you don’t actually want anyone else,” I muttered, walking into her despite her hands pushing my chest. “You’re attracted to me, aren’t you? You haven’t been this attracted to anyone in awhile. I woke up your need to fuck, so if you’re planning on fucking someone, why isn’t it the person you actually want?” I removed her hands from
 my chest and held them at her sides. “Why go for your second choice when your first wants you just as bad?” “’Cause I don’t trust you!” she hissed, undaunted by my face barely inches from hers. “Or any man like you, for that matter. I mean look at you! I barely know you and I already know that you have frequent threesomes, you fuck employees and you have friends who bring all-girl parties home at night. So why not fuck you? One, because to be honest, I don’t think I can handle you. Two, I don’t think I want to try and three, you’re going to forget me anyway – probably in two seconds, when you walk back into your apartment and twenty girls trip over themselves to give you anything you want.” “There could be four of them begging ass naked to be fucked and I wouldn’t be as hard as I get from just looking at you,” I said, close enough now that I could feel her chest grazing me with her every breath she took in. I watched her peer down, mouth parted and breathless as she watched her own tits press against me. I groaned, so turned on I hardly knew how to handle myself. “Just let me fucking kiss you,” I finally muttered. She breathed out. “Fine.” Grasping her hips, I slammed my lips over hers, thrusting my tongue in her mouth and tasting every corner as she yanked me closer by the belt. I groaned as her body pulsed between my chest and the wall, grinding hard against my cock. The sound of her short, frenzied breaths was driving me halfway insane. I could hear her desperation and I could imagine just how wet her pussy was for me as I nipped under her jaw now, licking down her neck till I was cupping her ribs in my hands and bringing her tits to my mouth. I sucked her nipple over her dress, feeling my cock swell against her thigh as she finally let out a moan. “Stop,” Lia gasped suddenly, jerking away. There was a half-second of apology in her eyes as she blinked in shock at me but before I could say a word, she was rushing into her door, slamming it fast behind her.            6      LIA   “I’m sorry, let me just get this straight – you don’t know your budget and you’re already shopping for leases?” I could hear the irritation in my realtor’s voice as we stood in the empty shop space on Orchard Street. It was beautiful with brand new hardwood, floor-to-ceiling windows and a commercial kitchen ready to go in the back. It was everything I wanted and so absolutely perfect. But I was a mess. It’d been three nights since my kiss in the hallway and I hadn’t slept much. On the night itself, I’d tossed and turned till 4AM. I’d listened to the girls streaming out of Lukas’s apartment around that hour and tried desperately to eavesdrop for anyone giggling about him taking someone to bed. I was jealous. And envious. And I couldn’t stop thinking about how his lips alone were better than any sex I’d ever had in my life. I also refused to leave my apartment in the morning till I’d gotten visual confirmation that he’d left the building. I even waited till I saw the car he climbed into drive off. It was ridiculous. And distracting. And while I tried to tell myself the crazy brain would go away in a few days, it didn’t. The late-night tossing and turning continued every night since the one I’d felt Lukas’s body on mine with every, and I mean every rock-hard inch of him pressed up against me. “Lia?” “Yes!” I snapped back to life. “I’m so sorry, Abby. Um, so, the thing is, I have a potential investor and pending that deal, I’m projecting to afford a monthly rent between the ranges of, um – ” I tore through my purse looking for the notes I’d written up last night. “I have it somewhere. I apologize. And I’m never like this, I just – ” “Relax. Have you even secured the investor yet?” “No. Not officially.” “And have you ever considered small business loans? Like everyone else does?” “Yes, but it’s a complicated story with my credit ‘cause my ex – ” Nope. Wasn’t gonna go there. Abby rolled her eyes. “We don’t need to talk about your personal issues. We’ll just meet another time, Miss Pope. Alright?” She left me no time to answer before walking ahead of me to the door. “But don’t expect this space to be available by the time you decide to figure your – ” She paused. “By the time you figure everything out.” God, she was tempted to say figure your shit out, that was how much I’d just pissed her off. “Of course,” I said in defeat, feeling like a dejected first grader as she held the door open for me to leave. “Thank you for your time, Abby. I promise I won’t waste it again.” “Try not to make promises you can’t keep,” she said, flashing me that deliberately fake realtor smile before leaving me on a final insult. “Besides, there’s always Craigslist.” On that, she turned on her red-heeled pumps and strutted up the street, already laughing on the phone within her first few steps away from me. Wow. Red in the face, I gathered myself on the sidewalk, in awe of what a total shitshow that just was. And while Abby had certainly been ruder than necessary, the fault was solely mine because I couldn’t frickin’ focus. I couldn’t gather the pieces of my scattered brain because I couldn’t stop thinking about Lukas. I had to slam my thighs together every time I remembered him touching me. Sucking on me. I was sure Abby had actually caught me one time and I was still shuddering from the hot embarrassment. “Fuck it,” I muttered to myself, fishing through my purse for my phone. Whatever was plaguing me, I couldn’t let this go on for another second. I had to nip it in the bud before it claimed another day or even another hour of productivity. So pacing fast up the block I made a call. “Darling,” Sara answered on the first ring. “I need help.” “Talk to me.” I pressed my finger against my ear as I turned on Houston, warding off the sounds of blaring traffic. “I need you to help me set an actual date with Dog Hater.” “Ooh, okay. When?” “Tonight.” Sara paused. “Are you serious? I thought you said you needed time to mentally prepare for this night.” “Yeah, well I think what I need more now is to clear my mind. I have to draft up a business proposal and pitch it to the investor this week and I need to frickin’ kill it. But I won’t if my brain is still trashed over Lukas.” “Mm. Mine would be trashed too if he kissed me like that in the hall.” “You’re not helping.” “I know. But can I quickly say that I still think neighbor-with-benefits could be a great solution for you?” “No! I lost three nights of sleep over a kiss from this guy – I can’t imagine how much I’d lose if I actually had sex with him,” I protested. “So please, pretty please, help me message Dog Hater. The app is in your phone and I’m desperate.” “Fine. I’m letting him know you can only do today.” “Thank you.” “Seven o’clock work for you?” “Works perfect,” I said, waiting around till I heard a little ping on her end. “Is that him confirming?” “Sure is…” Sara trailed off, audibly trying to contain her excitement. But I could practically hear her bouncing all giddy in her chair. “You know what this means right?” “Yes. Maybe.” I breathed out, letting the reality sink in. “It means you’re breaking the dry spell tonight. Probably around the 9PM range,” Sara giggled. “You ready to finally have sexy tonight, baby girl?” I hailed a cab as I gave my confident answer. “Nope,” I said, climbing in to get home and get ready. * * * It had been ages since I’d taken time out to get all dressed up – probably because the last remotely cool or sexy event I’d attended was a bachelorette party two years ago, for Sara’s sister. Since then, socializing was limited to a quick coffee in the afternoon or a single round of drinks at night. And of course there were Sundays – the official day of the week that Sara came over and drank wine all day while watching me make truffles, hawking the finished batches for the “ugly ones” that she was allowed to eat. As far as time and money went, I couldn’t afford to have much more fun than that. But tonight was different. Tonight was practically a business investment because I needed this date to scratch an itch and clear out brain space. And in order to go through with it, I needed to feel a hundred percent. So I bought a couple new things and let myself have a few hours to get ready, trying on a dozen old dresses before eventually settling on the one I’d borrowed from Sara for the bachelorette. Setting my wine down, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, looking at myself for once dressed up and giving myself a twirl. “Good Lord, Sara…” I murmured to myself. Considering my best friend towered over me, I wasn’t sure how she ever fit into this dress. It must’ve been a Band-Aid on her because it was already short on me. Then again, it might’ve just felt that way because of the heels. They were four, maybe four-and-a-half-inch black stilettos. Combined with the plunging V of the little white dress I had on, I felt myself veering into vixen territory – definitely a road less traveled for me, which was intimidating, but that was what the second glass of wine was for.    SARA: Hi. Something tells me you’re forgetting lipstick. Also if you’re wearing a bra with that dress, lose it.    I snorted at the surprise text that happened to be completely right.    ME: Fine. Can I wear a nude lip or does it have to be red? SARA: Nude lip is perfect do it up now SARA: But chill with the wine. No need to get shitfaced before meeting him. ME: Are you WATCHING me? SARA: Nope just got the BFF ESP. You still nervous? ME: You know it. SARA: Don’t be. You’ll be fine SARA: And if not you know who to call to save you. I can be there in 20 min with crazy eyes and pepper spray.   I giggled, sending a reply before tossing my phone aside and busting out the fancy makeup bag full of good stuff I never used. Admittedly, I went the safe route and blended lip liner instead of using full-blown lipstick but I did lose the bra, so in
 that department I made Sara proud. Of course, I probably canceled it out by chugging another glass of wine before throwing on my coat and waltzing out the door. I was surprisingly calm upon running into Lukas on the stairs. “Lia,” he breathed out in surprise. I smiled, halfway down the steps as he stood frozen at the foot of them, eyes wide and gazing  up at me. There was something delightful about the stunned look on his face. It made him feel for once unguarded – stripped of the usual swagger. And that in turn made me feel powerful. Either that, or I was drunk. “Hi,” I said, slowing my step down the stairs. I held onto the rail as I watched his blue-green eyes lock tight on my ankles then travel up my bare legs, stopping at the hem of my skirt. When I held my coat shut to hide my dress, he looked back up at me and shook his head. “What are you trying to do to me right now?” “Get past you so I can leave.” Lukas watched me come down the stairs, walking backward with me to the door. “Let me take you on this date,” he said. “No.” “Why not?” “Because someone’s expecting me.” “Cancel on him.” “He’s already there, Lukas. I’m not going to be rude.” He dragged a hand along his jaw and groaned. “Fine. Where are you going?” “Muse Room. Lower East Side.” He laughed despite a quizzical frown. “Seriously?” “Yes. Why?” “Have you ever been there?” “No, he picked the spot. He’s been arranging the date with my friend – it’s a long story,” I explained hastily off his perplexed look. “Why? What’s wrong with the place?” Lukas shook his head. “Nothing. It’s great. It’s just not what I expected for you. They have beds instead of couches and the waitresses walk around in full-blown lingerie.” I was surprised to hear that but I tried to bluff. “Okay. So? You think I’m some virginal thing that’s going to implode in any sexually charged environment? Just to let you know, I have had sex before. In fact, I’ve had a lot of it. Was it all with one guy? Yes. Does it still count? Yes. Was it any good?” I paused for several moments as I thought about my own question. “Are you drunk?” I blinked. “No.” I wobbled. “I’m just… in heels.” “Trust me, I noticed,” he muttered, eyeing me up and down again before groaning. “Jesus Christ. You’re killing me, Lia.” “What? Why?” “Because I don’t want you to fuck this guy,” he said. “Plain ands simple. Aside from being pissed that it’s not me, I don’t want to be the reason you got yourself hammered so you could force enough attraction to sleep with some guy you just met. I haven’t known you long but I know that’s not you.” “Just a reminder, you and I have known each other for less than a week, so cool it.” “You’ve known Tess almost three years and you’ve heard her talking about her brother so let’s not act like I’m just some stranger off the street,” Lukas said, annoyed. Palming the back of his head, he exhaled. “Lia, I’m begging you,” he murmured, a handsome frown pinching his brows. “Stay in tonight,” he said gently. “I’ll keep my suit on, you’ll keep your dress on – it can still be a date but we can just order pizza or Chinese, and no one has to sleep with anyone. Alright? How’s that sound?” Amazing. Adorable. Fucking everything I want. But I still resisted. Rather, I put off giving my answer because the one at the tip of my tongue was “okay” and I wanted to at least pretend I had a lick of self-control before giving in. But just as I started to answer, the ring of his phone interrupted. When he glanced down with an instant groan, I let myself peek at his call. No. You have got to be kidding me. I fumed as I read the name “Useless Gold Digger Bitch” off his glowing screen. Oh. My. God. Un-fucking-believable A part of me wanted to bend over and dramatically retch for Lukas, just to show him how phenomenally disgusting I found him at this very moment. Another part wanted to lay into him for thinking he could actually trick me into thinking he wasn’t the worst, but instead I swallowed my temptation and simply thanked the universe for reminding me that despite his occasional sweetness, Lukas Hendricks was in fact an asshole. Of the highest degree. “Really nice thing to call a girl.” I shot a look of revulsion. “I’m gonna go ahead and pass on your takeout offer but I hope you have a great night,” I added tersely, shaking my head as I pushed past his broad frame and slid out the front door.            7      LIA   Okay, so the bar did kind of look like a sordid sex dungeon with its black lace walls and reddish glow. Pretty aggressive for a first date. I knew that was the point but it was still nerve-wracking. But thankfully, within thirty minutes of sitting with Hayden the Dog Hater, I found that he was mild enough to put me at ease. “Don’t be afraid to tell me if you don’t like your drink, Lia,” he offered, nodding at my untouched glass. “I’d be more than happy to get you a new one.” “Oh, don’t worry, I like it,” I assured him with a smile. “I’m just taking it slow.” “Oh,” he nodded politely. “Well, I’m glad you like it. And it’s always good to take it slow,” he smiled back. Agh. I mean he was… nice. He hadn’t said a word about me being fifteen minutes late and to my relief he’d picked one of the booths instead of one of the overly sexy, bed-like seats. So he had that going for him and he was handsome. His smile was a dazzling white and he looked great in a tan sweater, brown jeans and camel loafers. Sure, he was weirdly monochromatic and dressed in a way that reminded me of handsome human cardboard, but it worked on him. Kind of. And even if it didn’t work on him, it didn’t matter because more than ever now, I needed to get Lukas out of my head. That sexist pig. I just couldn’t figure it out with him. Every time I leaned toward the idea that he might be okay, something reminded me that he was everything I should avoid. And just now, the latest reminder was the fact that he saved a woman’s contact in his phone as “Useless Gold Digger Bitch.” How could I possibly how found myself hung up over someone like that? It was the hotness, I clucked at myself. See, that is the evil of flawless bone structure and absurdly defined muscles. They’re like the sun – they’re dangerous, they will blind you and you should never look directly at them ever again, I decided as Hayden went on about the superhero show he binged on Netflix last week. I might’ve tuned out. No, I definitely did because suddenly, I was listening to the manager and waitress murmuring behind me. At first, it was because I found it amusing to hear them quietly trash the Wall Street douchebag in the corner, talking over everyone in the room about his big merger or whatever. But now I was listening to them because one of them was making muffled squealing noises and audibly bouncing on her heels behind me. “Oh my God. Omigod, omigod, what is that.” “What is what?” “That. All three of that. Oh my God, I can’t even talk.” I paused. Hold up. Three presumably good-looking men coming in barely forty minutes after I did? Right away, I had a hunch but I didn’t want to be right so I refused to entertain it. Focusing my eye contact on Hayden, I ignored the weird suspicion in my bones and the sudden heat in my belly. I made sure to put a smile on for him, too, nodding zealously along to everything he said. Still, I couldn’t ignore the women talking behind me. “I’m gonna kill the hostess if she tries to seat all that hotness at the bar.” “Omigod, look, the big one just pointed like he wants to sit here!” Shit, the evidence was damning but I refused to confirm it. Don’t look around, don’t look around, whatever you do, don’t look around. I didn’t look around. But that was no help because in seconds, I was watching a corset-clad hostess walk two tall men in front of our table, seating them at the booth directly across from ours. And oh, did I recognize one. It wasn’t Lukas, but it was that David Beckham-looking motherfucker who’d sat behind Sara at the café, who’d ratted me out for being a thirsty, sexless Lukas Hendricks fangirl – to Lukas. He had a wicked grin on for me now and I was convinced I could smack him. I wanted to launch myself across the table as he caught my eye and dared to laugh, leaning over to the friend I assumed was Emmett. My face was aflame as they both looked at me, studying me, muttering to each other as if appraising me like a damned car. After a couple seconds, Emmett raised his eyebrows at me and nodded to Beckham, as if giving me the honor of his approval. Douchebags – I don’t need your approval! I wanted to snap at them, making a fist around my drink. “Lia, are you okay?” I blinked over at a frowning Hayden. “Huh? Oh. Uh-huh,” I replied unconvincingly, swallowing the giant knot in my throat. “Are you still thinking about your bad day?” he asked sweetly. “Yes,” I nodded, eagerly taking the excuse. “I was. I just … ugh, that darned realtor!” I laughed, giving an awkward shake of my fist. “They’re just, uh, yeah. The worst. Will you excuse me for a second?” He sat me down as I tried to get up. “Hold on. What’s wrong?” “Nothing. I just…” I looked down at my glass. “It’s too strong. I think I’m going to go to the bar and ask for a new drink.” “I’ll do it!” Hayden insisted. “Please. What kind of gentleman would I be if I didn’t?” he smiled, grabbing my glass and sliding out of the booth. I tried to protest but before I knew it, he was gone and I was suddenly holding my breath because walking into the room was none other than Lukas. He commanded all eyes in that sleek, black suit I’d seen him in at home. The shirt he had on underneath was crisp, black as well and while he’d worn a tie before, he didn’t now. Apparently, I noticed those things. Gorgeous bastard, I cursed him since all I could do was helplessly sit and watch him approach me, his eyes burning into mine. His sheer size eclipsed the light as he made his way to my table and stood before me –
 raw masculinity wrapped in an expensive Italian suit. “You look beautiful.” He said it before I could so much as open my mouth and just like that I was compromised. “Thank you,” I murmured, watching him watch me. I had to blink several times before I even remembered I was pissed at him. “Lukas – ” I shook my head. “What you are doing here? I know you didn’t come just to have drinks with your friends.” “I have no interest in hiding that I’m here for you.” “And why are you here for me? You thought I couldn’t protect myself from an Internet stranger?” “No, I thought you got an inaccurate impression of me back at the house and I couldn’t sit through my night without fixing it.” I stared. “So you came all the way here to interrupt my date? Because I caught you calling some poor girl a gold digging bitch?” I laughed in bitter disbelief. “First of all, it hardly surprises me. Second, what could you possibly say to defend yourself?” “I can say that Emmett was the one responsible for naming that particular contact – ” “Please, Lukas – ” “ – and the person in question isn’t a woman. It’s a guy named Cam,” Lukas said, his cheeks flexing when he said the name. I narrowed my eyes. “Who’s that?” “Formerly my best friend. And business partner. I forced him out of my company two months ago and he’s been calling repeatedly to argue the terms of his buyout. Feels duped, wants more money, the like. My friends hate him as much as I do and Emmett,” Lukas glanced over his shoulder, “who has his own unique charm with words,” he smirked, “put that nickname in my phone. If you don’t believe me, I’ll leave this here.” To my surprise, Lukas slid his naked iPhone across the table in front of me, the screen already open to his missed calls. I stared at the last one – “Useless Gold Digging Bitch.” The time stamp matched the time I’d seen the call come in at home and a part of me did want to grab the phone and call right back. And then maybe flip through his camera roll and see what kind of dirt he had in there – sex tapes, dick pics, incriminating screenshots. There had to be a bounty of fascinating material from just the photos alone and biting my lip, I stared at the phone with true temptation. It was the coveted gateway into the mind of men as ridiculously hot and successful as Lukas, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t wish I could just read him like a book. Still, I pushed the thing back at him. “It’s fine, I believe you,” I muttered. “But you should go now. My date’s going to be back soon and – ” “You’re not remotely interested in him.” I cocked an eyebrow. “Oh, I’m not?” He cracked a little smile. “No.” “And how on Earth do you know that?” “I know exactly what you look like turned on – let’s not pretend that isn’t a fact,” Lukas returned easily, his stare falling to my mouth. “I know just how pink and swollen those lips can get when you’re all hot and bothered. I know how you start to squirm. And I didn’t see any of that till about ten seconds ago. Correct me if I’m wrong but your date’s been gone much longer than that.” I was defiant. “He’s nice.” Lukas smirked. “I’m nice.” “You couldn’t even say that without laughing,” I snorted. “Give me a chance then,” he grinned. “I can be nice to you if you let me.” Damn it. I believed him. I wasn’t sure why but I did since I knew it was a bad idea to. My fragile attraction for Hayden was based solely off of negative feelings for Lukas, and now those were fading again. And I couldn’t afford that. “Fine,” I finally said. “Then be nice to me now, Lukas, by leaving me alone. Just because you’re here doesn’t mean I stopped being on a date.” He stared at me a second, as if trying to read my bluff. “Fine,” he said. “Just don’t drink too much,” he added with a smirk, turning on his heel before I could tell him to mind his own business. Grrr. I raged silently as I watched him sit with his friends at their booth, quickly joining Emmett in charming the figurative pants off the waitress. She was giggling nonstop and so hard I was sure I might see her pass out from lack of oxygen. Ugh. Did I just tell Lukas to leave me alone and then get upset that he left me alone? God. I wanted to tear at my own hair. What sense did my brain make anymore? Apparently none. “Lia?” “Just a former coworker,” I blurted when Hayden sat back down. He gave a quizzical look that told me he hadn’t seen Lukas at all. “What?” he frowned, seeming flustered and distracted himself. “Um, I was just going to say that this is annoying but I couldn’t get you a new drink,” he muttered, gripping my original glass. “Apparently, we can’t order from the bar if we’re sitting at a table. Bullshit, if you ask me, but now we can just not tip.” I stared at him, instantly put off. Damn it, Hayden. Why? I was rooting for you. Why did you have to go and ruin it? I groaned inwardly while outwardly forcing a smile. “Actually, no, I used to be a waitress, so let’s definitely not do that. Besides,” I pried the glass from his hand, “it probably tastes fine now that the ice is melted. In fact – ” Bringing the drink to my lips, I took two-and-a-half large gulps, watching Hayden’s eyes widen over the brim of the glass. “See?” I wiped my mouth with my ring finger when I was done. “Everything’s fine,” I said despite knowing it wasn’t. What little interest I had in Hayden was officially gone and drinking did nothing to help it. On top of that, I knew Lukas was watching me with disapproval for what I’d just done. I couldn’t help looking over to confirm it. Oh… Oh yeah. My heart pounded when I caught his eyes on me, a stony look on his face as I heard Hayden murmur “damn” and scoot closer. He said something about how I looked “cute with a little liquid courage” in me, but I didn’t hear the rest because I was too busy having an intense, wordless stare-off with Lukas. From his booth, he shook his head lightly, just enough for me to see. From mine, I gave a subtle shrug as if to say, what are you going to do? “I hope this doesn’t sound creepy but you’re seriously sexy when you’re drunk,” Hayden murmured in my ear. “What makes you think I’m drunk?” I asked distractedly, my heart hammering as I watched Lukas lean back in his seat, taking a drink as he continued to watch me. His body language was calm, collected but his eyes were an entirely different story. Fuck, no man should look that good angry, I thought as Hayden’s chuckle tickled my skin. “I don’t know. I guess I thought so ‘cause your lips got all red and swollen.” Mm-hm. “They just do that sometimes.” “Yeah? When you’re turned on?” Hayden made me go stiff with a hand on the upper part of my thigh. Crap. My pulse picked up when Lukas sat up. “Hayden,” I warned, removing his hand. My breaths were short and serrated now as I snuck glances at Lukas. His entire body faced me now, his darkened eyes trained on my every breath, as if waiting for the slightest sign that I needed out. “I’m sorry. You’re just kind of irresistible right now,” Hayden said softly, sitting so close our chests touched. I didn’t have to look up to catch the swift movement of Beckham jerking Lukas back into his seat. “Thank you…” I said unsurely, looking around for a bathroom. I felt eyes on me – Lukas, his friends, possibly the waitress. I hated the attention. It had my body temperature suddenly out of control. “Hayden, sorry, I just…” “What?” When his hand cupped my knee, Lukas yanked his arm free from Beckham’s grip. My heartbeat quickened. “I need to go to the restroom,” I blurted. “I need to kiss you first,” Hayden murmured, grabbing my cheek and covering his mouth sloppily over mine. A sharp gasp burned my lungs as my peripherals spotted Lukas leaping up from his seat. And just as quickly, I shoved Hayden to excuse myself from mine. Shit, shit, shit, holy shit. Blood rushed in my ears, loud enough to muffle my heels clacking in a hurry toward the bathroom. My heart was pounding as I rushed down a dim hallway, my mind racing with a million thoughts that all had to do with Lukas. Frickin’ asshole. I was humiliated by the scene that just unfolded outside and while Hayden was mostly at fault, I blamed Lukas. He knew he would make me nervous. He probably knew he’d cause some kind of scene and he still came to crash my date. I hated that. On that topic, I also hated how I did everything right to avoid distractions like him but then one night, he just happened upon me. I hated that no matter what I did, thought, schemed or said, he always managed to have the upper hand. But more than anything, I hated that I was unpredictable around Lukas Hendricks. I barely knew him yet he had some kind of hold over me. One look at me and he had me wanting things I never even thought about before the day we met and that thought pissed me off more than anything as I finally shoved my way into the women’s bathroom. But it didn’t stop me from letting the footsteps behind follow me in. “Lia.” I groaned a culmination of my frustration. “Damn it, Lukas, what are you trying to – ” I’d barely spun around before he caught the nape of my neck and reclaimed my mouth, his tongue sweeping against mine with unapologetic roughness. My fingers dug into his shoulders as he grabbed a handful of my dress. Fisting it, he pulled me against him, continuing his vicious onslaught against my lips. I could taste his aggression, his urgency and I kissed him back with the same hot desire. My pussy throbbed the instant he dropped his hands to my ass and squeezed. I felt his hot erection press against my belly but before I could lose all control, I pushed away. “Not here,” I breathed out, my cheeks on fire as he hit me with that steely gaze. “Tell me what that means.” I clenched my jaw. “You know what it means.” “What?” “That I want you.” “You’ve wanted me,” Lukas corrected. “What you mean now is that you need me.” “Fine,” I bit out. “I need you to fuck me. Not him. I’m not going to deny that
 anymore because I can’t but I don’t want to do it here.” I backed up, overwhelmed as Lukas moved toward me. “I can’t have you touch me again either,” I blurted breathlessly, “because if you do I’ll get tempted and despite the fact that I need to come more than anything in the world right now, I don’t want to have sex in a bathroom at some bar. Not for the first time in this long.” I exhaled and caught my breath. “I have to do it my way. Exactly how I want it.” “That’s fine,” Lukas said. His stare was heavy on my breasts spilling out of the dress he’d twisted askew on my body. I chewed my lip as I watched him watch me, curious if I could push my luck. “Also.” My breath went jagged when he flicked those eyes back up at me. “I want you to leave after we leave this bathroom. Take your friends, go to another bar and when you get home tonight, don’t knock on my door. Just wait for me to text you and tell you what I want.” “Tell me what you want, how you want it. And we’ll do it.” Lukas’s voice came back languid, so thick with lust that what he said next hardly surprised me. “You’ll just have to give me the next two minutes to do whatever else I want to you.” Off my silence, he cocked an eyebrow. “Deal?” My lashes fluttered. My best bet was to resist and say no but I was way too hot and way too curious, which just about summed up my whole damned relationship with Lukas. So nodding, I murmured, “Okay.” He wet his lips. “Good. Now turn around.” Swallowing hard, I did what I was told. My heart thumped against my chest, my sense of touch and sound heightening the moment I stood with my back facing him. “Walk over to that table.” His voice was soft, husky. “And pull your skirt up for me.” The shameless demand froze me for a moment. But with one heel in front of the other, I made my way to the vanity, cursing it for having no mirror. I wanted so badly to just look at him. I wanted to see what he looked like watching me as I reached the table. My fingertips skimmed its edge before I worked up the courage to reach down and grab my skirt. Gripping its edge, I peeled it slowly up my thighs, the cold air prickling over my bare skin. I couldn’t see Lukas but with my senses on high alert, I heard him. Barely, but I did catch the breath he sucked between his teeth once I had my dress hiked up to my waist, my ass exposed for him in the white lace thong I’d bought for Hayden. Come on. My thighs twitched, my fingers digging into my handfuls of cotton as I waited for his next command. But instead I heard nothing. It was silent for what felt like an eternity as I stood there, once again half-naked for Lukas and aching for his touch. I almost jumped when I heard a sharp metal click. The door. He’d locked it. Just knowing that, heat rushed through my veins. “Lukas,” I pleaded. “Tell me what to do next.” “Bend over. Take your panties off for me.” I hooked my thumbs in the sides of my thong, biting my lip as I bent over and pulled the lace down to my knees, letting it fall the rest of the way down to the floor. I heard Lukas coming behind me but still gasped when I felt him graze my naked backside as he sank to a crouch. “Let me have them.” I stepped out of my thong, peeking down to watch his hands gather it off the floor. I didn’t have to see to know that he’d tucked it into his pocket, and I could hardly breathe as I felt him spread my legs wide, rumbling with approval when I bent over the table without him asking. My cheek pressed against the cold surface as I turned to watch him. But my eyes squeezed shut the second he grabbed my ass and spread it apart, giving no warning before he ran the flat of his cool tongue along my hot pussy. “Oh my God.” The words barely squeaked out of my throat as my entire body clenched and relaxed, over and over as he buried his mouth against me and licked. He gave me no time to breathe or catch up to what was happening. All he did was pulse his tongue against me, all over me, lapping at me so furiously I could hear the sounds of my wetness slapping every wall of the room. “Play with your clit.” I was stroking myself before he even finished his sentence. I heard his sexy laugh behind me as he pulled back to watch for a moment. “God, you get my dick so fucking hard,” he growled, gripping the back of my thigh and squeezing as he slid his palm up to my ass. With a spank and a yelp from my lips he smirked and pushed me back down on the table, lifting my right leg up so that I was spread wider for him now. My knee up next to my shoulder, he went straight to sucking on my clit. “Lukas!” I cried out and clasped a hand over my mouth. As his tongue bathed my pussy, his thumb gently rubbed against my ass, spoiling and teasing me at the same time. It was such an explosion of clashing sensations that my stomach clenched and before I knew it, I was shaking, relying on his strong hands to keep me in place as I lurched forward and came. Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. I stared at the wall as he marveled at the unbelievable wetness of my pussy. My heart pounded against the table as I held onto every last spasm of pleasure shocking my body. Holy fucking shit. Slowly, I returned both feet back to the ground. That was quite possibly the best two minutes of my life. Still trembling, I finally breathed, relaxing my grip off the edge of the table and watching the color return to my knuckles. Behind me, Lukas returned to his feet, making a low mm sound as he cupped the back of my leg, ran his palm up my thigh and spanked my ass one more time. Then with a hand fondling my breast, he stood me straight again, holding me against his chest as his free hand pulled my skirt back down my ass. I let my head roll back against his shoulder for a second and closed my eyes, savoring the lasting sensation of what the hell he’d just done to me. I only opened them when he turned me gently around, perching me on the edge of the table. “How do you feel?” His question was teasing but I answered it with complete truth. “So good,” I breathed out. I stared at his mouth, convinced it possessed some kind of fucking magic. He grinned as he watched me for a moment, clearly relishing the dazed look he’d just put on my face. “Good,” he finally said, giving his cock an adjustment before nodding out the door. “I’ll leave you alone now. Right?” I could only nod, my body still buzzing as I watched Lukas head for the door, unlock it and leave.            8      LUKAS   In the morning, I awoke to a charmingly scatterbrained text.   LIA: Actually never mind. Let’s go to dinner first. Yes.   I grinned, having had a feeling that she’d change her mind about the original plan. She’d texted it to me last night while I was at a bar with Emmett, enduring a round of drinks to give her the head start home that she wanted. Hanging out with Emmett was usually torture for a variety of reasons, but last night it had all to do with Lia. All I could think about was her. Within seconds of leaving her, I wanted more of her. I waited for the feeling to drift off as we moved from the first bar to one of Emmett’s, but it didn’t. I was experienced when it came to the pain of her sexy image haunting me, but last night it was also her scent. Her sounds. Her sweet fucking taste. It had me desperate to just go home, find her and fuck her senseless on her bed. But I’d agreed to let her decide on the plan and according to the text she sent, the plan was for me to show up at her apartment this evening for sex. No strings attached. I had no problem with that. In fact, I got hard just reading the message but like a masochist, I suggested dinner first. I was skeptical of her ability to dive right in and I wound up right. She’d declined the offer last night but after sleeping on it, clearly she had changed her mind.   ME: Great. I like that plan better. Pick you up at 8? LIA: 8 is perfect.   I watched the ellipsis disappear and reappear repeatedly as Lia clearly kept typing and deleting whatever was on her mind. But finally, her text came through and it spread the grin on my lip even wider.    LIA: Can’t wait : )   * * * “Lukas. You didn’t. Why?” Tess sounded less than pleased when I confessed my plans for the night. It was closing in on 2AM where she was but I was hardly surprised to hear her call. Like me, she’d always been a night owl. I blamed our parents. As kids, we refused to sleep till we knew they were home and of course, they were never in a rush. Once Tess and I realized the pattern, we started betting on who could stay awake longer at night. I lost years’ worth of allowance to that girl. Apparently, the kid didn’t need sleep. I grew up convinced of it because every night, without fail, she stayed up till Mom and Dad got home, whether it was one in the morning or eight. “Lukas. Lukas James Hendricks. Do not ignore me.” I laughed as I grabbed my phone off the counter and went to the couch. “Sorry. I was getting a drink.” “Don’t be sorry about that, be sorry about the fact that you’re trying to sleep with my favorite neighbor.” “You only have two.” “Yeah, and you’re sleeping with the one I actually like,” she protested. “What happens when you break her heart, Luke? I’m going to come home and she’s going to hate me because I’m associated with the guy who chased her like it was his job and then dumped her once he got her in bed.” “Christ. You make it sound like I do that often.” “Dude,” Tess said dryly. “You do. You see a pretty girl, you decide you need to have her and then you get your taste and it’s on to the next. The only ones you sleep with repeatedly are the ones at the office and that’s only because it’s convenient for you.” “If it makes you feel any better, I’ve spent an irritating amount of time thinking about this girl.” “I mean you should because she’s awesome and nice and crazy hardworking but that’s historically never mattered for you. I mean I love you, Lukas, but you’re kind
 of shallow.” “What? Alright. Take it easy, Tinker Bell.” She groaned. “I just like her is all.” “Trust me, I’m in the same boat.” “Yeah? Name one thing you like about her besides the way she looks.” “I might be addicted to her voice,” I said. “I can tell she’s fiercely protective of her independence and I find that intriguing.” I paused, taking a drink. “She’s also insanely sexy when she’s pissed at me so I can only imagine what she looks like pleased with me.” “Well, if you want a shot at finding out you better go,” Tess muttered, annoyed. “It’s five past eight.” “Shit.” I sprung to my feet. “Talk to you later.” “Love you,” she grumbled, adding, “dickhead,” before hanging up. I laughed as I grabbed my jacket and keys. My sister was clearly annoyed with me but I still counted that conversation as a good one. Anytime I could hear her voice sounding crisp and clear with some sort of audible emotion, it was a win. Especially now. It was getting close to the anniversary of the day that turned our lives upside down. We were both known to fall into dark places in the weeks leading up to it but lately, between Lia and the constant drama at work, I had my distractions. Tess, however, had nothing but countryside to stare out at all day and night. But on the bright side, she had Grandma Elodie. At eight-six, the woman still jogged every morning and was still sharp as a whip, so I could definitely take comfort in the fact that she was with Tess, keeping an eye on her at all times. Though I hoped Grandma Elodie hadn’t overheard that particular conversation. Shallow my ass, I thought as I knocked on Lia’s door. “Just a minute!” I heard her call from inside. “Take your time,” I said, quickly replying to the apology text Tess sent me. I was laughing at her text back when Lia finally opened the door. “Sorry, I was just – ” I shut up once I looked up, her smile snatching the words off my tongue. Shit. Tugging the knot of my tie, I gave her the onceover. God-fuckin’-damn. She looked incredible. The olive green dress stretched over her body was long, skimming her ankles, but it hugged her curves perfectly and gave me a generous hint of leg with the slit up the side. Judging from the look on her face, she had at least a hunch she looked good. “Hi,” Lia said, biting her lip as she stepped out into the hall. “I take it back.” “What?” “Let’s go to bed and get dinner after.” “Shut up,” she rolled her eyes, walking ahead of me down the hall. Christ, that ass. It was tight, round and perfect, and the way her hips twitched from side to side with every step was fucking hypnotizing. “What if I said please?” “I didn’t take an hour getting dressed for nothing, Lukas, now let’s go.” “Hold up.” I grinned at the dry look she was already shooting me. “You took an hour to get ready for me?” “Yes. I did. I haven’t dated in a long time so sue me for enjoying myself while getting ready.” I nodded. “So this is a date.” “No. It’s not a date,” she corrected hastily. “It’s just… foreplay.” I could feel the dirtiness in my smirk. “I can work with that.” “Ah, ah, ah,” Lia warned, narrowing those sexy eyes at me. “No funny business while we’re at dinner. I didn’t mean foreplay as in you trying to… touch me under the table.” “Touch what? You’re not seriously going to be shy with me when I had my tongue in your pussy last night, are you?” “Lukas!” Lia hissed, covering her face for a moment. “Please do not talk about what happened last night.” “Why?” “Because I want to sit through dinner before I ruin my panties,” she snapped, grinning when I lifted my eyebrows. “They’re new,” she said, her voice softer. “And they’re pretty,” she added with a little smirk. I gave her a look of warning. “Keep telling me. I’ll fuck you in this hall, Lia.” “Stop.” Her giggle was half-groan as she stared up at the ceiling, red in the cheeks. “Don’t torture me, Lukas. We’re going to dinner first,” she finally said sternly. “You made a reservation and I bought a new dress. Now are you coming or not?” “We could both be coming in about fifteen if you let me pin you up on this wall.” “And for that, you don’t get to touch me at all during dinner.” My face fell. “Whoa, hey. That’s fucked up,” I said and I meant it. But for the laugh it put on her face, I let it go and followed her with a grin down the hall.            9      LUKAS   I broke the rule fast. Apparently, all it took was some guy staring at her ass for too long. “Hey. No touching,” Lia reminded me, gently removing my hand from her lower back. “I feel like there should’ve been a grace period for that,” I muttered. There was a sexy dimple in her cheek as she smiled. “We would’ve never gotten out the door if there was.” “Can’t argue that,” I conceded as we followed the hostess to our table. The restaurant was small, barely thirty seats, and I could count almost half of them having glanced up at Lia as she walked by, oblivious to her own sex appeal in that painted-on dress. Every step she took, every move she made gave me a new angle of her knockout curves and each one chipped steadily away at my self-control. I had to practically meditate the urges away as I held out her chair, watching her smooth her hands over her lap as she took a seat. “It’s pretty in here,” she smiled, looking around as I sat across from her. “I’ve never been here before. I mean of course I haven’t. I haven’t been to most places yet,” she laughed at herself. “I’m definitely never in the West Village. Or anywhere on the West Side.” “Why not?” She frowned. “I don’t know. I think subconsciously, I just like to stay close to home. There’s never a moment where I don’t feel like I should be working.” I remembered the feeling. “It gets that way when you start your own company. The beginning is always the worst.” “Oh God, yes,” she said, her smile gleaming at the server who presented a menu. “It got so much worse when I went full-time. I mean my apartment doubles as my office so it never really feels like I’m off. It always feels like I’m supposed to be doing something,” she sighed, though her smile remained as she studied the menu. Leaning back, I watched her. She had her pointy chin perched in her hand, her finger running lightly down the paper as she read each dish to herself in a little murmur. “I remember that,” I said finally. “What did you do before you went full-time?” “Waitressed. It was the only real job experience I had so that’s what I went with when I got here.” “Where are you from?” Lia peered up. “Oh. Lukas.” She smiled. “Are we doing the classic getting-to-know-you-dance? Just to remind you, this isn’t a real date so you don’t have to act all interested in my life.” “I genuinely am but thanks for the out. I’ll use it if I feel the need. In the meantime, where are you from?” She gave the obligatory eye roll but I got a small laugh out of her. “Upstate New York,” she answered. “Tiny town called Marlowe,” she added with a face. “I take it you didn’t like it there.” “Loved the town. Hated the memories I left with.” Lia avoided my gaze as she went suddenly from the menu to the wine list. “Breakups and such,” she muttered. “Well – breakup. Singular. It was only one jerk the whole time I was there. I left literally the day I broke up with him.” “And how long ago was that?” “Two-and-a-half years ago.” I raised a curious eyebrow. “So you stopped having sex with your boyfriend six months before breaking up.” Her eyes shot up at me. “What are you, Sherlock Holmes?” “It was basic math, but sure.” She squinted for several moments but with a snort and a shrug, she said, “Fuck it – yes. We went at least six months without sex towards the end. His choice.” I choked on my water. “I can’t even fucking fathom that.” “Well… fathom it.” “Was he sexually interested in women?” Lia gave a dry laugh. “Oh, he was interested in women. He just preferred to watch porn and jerk off because that didn’t require thinking about another person’s pleasure.” Christ, what an asshole. I could’ve come last night just from listening to Lia orgasm, so I had genuine trouble picturing a man who wouldn’t want to hear that sound as much as humanly possible. “Damn,” I finally said. “I know. Shall we change the subject?” “No, I’d like to know more about this boyfriend. There had to be a reason you stayed with him for however long you did.” “There was. And I’ll tell you all about it if you tell me about Cam.” Lia cocked a daring eyebrow. Fuck me, the last thing I wanted to talk about was Cam but the sexy look she gave me somehow won me over so I played it off and gave a shrug. “Fine,” I agreed. “Shall we order wine first?” “Absolutely.” I went with a bottle of Bordeaux and the tasting menu, letting Lia hold off on her story as we waited on the wine. She was bouncing with the need to check out the big painting hanging on the back wall so I wound up watching with amusement as she failed to contain herself, eventually getting up and weaving through the tables to go get a look. I obviously enjoyed the view but I wasn’t exactly pleased with the other eyes that followed me in gazing at Lia’s backside. I rarely had the energy to care about other men eyeing my date but something was different tonight. I couldn’t help feeling protective as she abandoned her usual caution to admire a simple painting. Jesus. She really nailed that whole sexy-but-cute thing. Even from the back, I could see her sense of wonder while soaking in every inch of the canvas, the same way I was so damned eager to do with her body. I had to smile her entire scurry back to the table. “Sorry, sorry!” she whispered, slipping back into her seat. “It’s just so beautiful. I had to study it hard to take a proper mental picture.” “Why didn’t you just use your phone?” She looked up with surprise. “I thought I would embarrass you.” I laughed. “You would have but I’d let you. Tell me what was so captivating about that painting for you.” “I don’t
 know.” Her dreamy voice drifted off somewhere. “The colors. And patterns. It reminded me of pictures I grew up seeing of the food markets in Spain. And I sell more hand painted truffles than anything so I like to take inspiration here and there.” I nodded at the bottle the waiter came to present, doing a quick taste and approval before returning my attention to Lia. “You’ve been to Spain?” “No. I haven’t been anywhere outside the U.S,” she answered. There was a hint of bitterness mixed in the regret of her voice. “I want to though. Barcelona, in particular. I tend to gravitate so much toward Spanish flavors when I’m making chocolate.” “Why’s that?” “Ah.” She winced and touched the back of her neck. “I guess… this is a good transition into talking about Ritchie.” “The one and only ex?” “Mm-hm.” She peered up at me as if anticipating a reaction for what she was about to say. “I met him when I was fifteen. I was with him for ten years.” “Holy shit.” “I know. And yes, there were reasons I stayed. The wrong ones, I’m sure but they felt right at the time.” Lia stared at the wine that she swirled in her glass. Wrinkling her nose, she looked up at me. “You’re sure you wanna hear about this?” she double-checked with a laugh. “It’s not at all interesting. It’s just how I… got to be the way that I am.” “Then it’s interesting,” I said. “Tell me.” She took a sip of her wine, letting out a pleasured little hum into the glass. “Well,” she started slowly, drawing out the word as if buying herself time. “We met in high school. He was new and I had a crush from day one so my friends pushed it. We started dating out of nowhere and it was a normal, healthy high school relationship until probably a year later.” She paused. “When my mom died. Of a heart attack.” “I’m sorry,” I frowned hard. “You don’t have to go on.” “It’s okay. I can,” she said lightly, though she took her time to. The first course came and she took a bite before going on. “It’s been almost ten years, so I can talk about it now. Not sure about my dad though. He never really got back on his feet after she went and Ritchie’s mom loved me like a daughter from the start. She was always cooking fancy dinners for me and I was always at their place, so it was kind of a natural transition for me to live there. At least it felt that way. It was just my normal.” She looked up at me. “I’m sure it sounds weird to you though, right?” “No.” I studied the warm glow on her face from the candlelight. “I had my own normal too. And it wasn’t.” “Normal?” “Nowhere near.” “Oh.” Her mouth parted like she wanted to ask me about it but she stopped herself. “Anyway.” She pushed her hair back and blinked back down at her wine. “Ritchie’s mom, Gail, basically raised me. Her husband left her many, many years ago – way before I met her – but she was always just this bright, happy-go-lucky woman and she never stopped talking about her honeymoon.” Lia’s eyes sparkled with her laugh. “But not even because of her husband. Because of the food. The paella. The spices and the chocolate.” “I’m guessing her honeymoon was somewhere in Spain.” “Bingo, Sherlock. Barcelona,” she smirked. “You’re good at this.” “What can I say.” Lia smiled at me. “Then I think you can guess that she was the one who started my fascination with chocolate,” she said, her voice a warm murmur. “We’d spend all day making just regular chocolate, dark chocolate truffles, almond truffles. We’d put saffron in it. Sometimes we’d make complete abominations and we knew they were probably going to suck going in to it, but we just did it. Chocolate paella. We did everything,” she chuckled. “And, um,” she frowned into the distance, “I guess it got complicated within a few years. Ritchie and I both went to the same college but then Gail started hurting herself around the house.” She caught the alarm on my face. “Not purposely,” she clarified. “I mean she would leave a pan on an open flame and burn herself. Or she’d put a knife in the wrong drawer and the next time she reached in, she’d cut herself.” “Alzheimer’s?” “Early onset,” Lia nodded, pursing her lips. “And Ritchie said I was always better with her, which was true, so I wound up… well, I went from full-time student to part-time to dropout so I could be home to take care of her. Ritchie convinced me by saying I could take the time to work on my recipes and make the chocolates into a business.” Lia looked up at me. “You probably think I’m so stupid right now.” “Not at all,” I said straightaway. “That’s how it goes with family. You’d do anything for them.” “Thank you,” she said in a way that had me guessing that she’d dealt with her fair share of ridicule for the decision. “And I took online classes at home. For business. Nothing great but it helped me feel less like a piece of shit,” she laughed to herself. “I saved up money, too, basically babysitting every kid on the block at the same time. Gail and I basically ran a daycare at home except most of the time, I was watching over her as well. But with that money, I wound up actually trying to make a business work. I bought nicer molds and equipment. I bought the domain and paid someone to do my designs and packaging. And it kind of grew… very slowly… but eventually I got little gigs around town for party favors. I did stuff for the high school proms and graduations. I was making money. Not Manhattan money but it was money. Enough to see a meaningful profit.” “And Ritchie was in school this whole time?” I asked, running a finger over my bottom lip. “I have this sneaking suspicion that he wasn’t doing much while you were busting your ass.” She shook her head at me. “Is my life that transparent or are you just really perceptive?” I laughed. “I can just relate.” “Because of Cam? The worthless, gold digging bitch?” Lia cocked an eyebrow. “You bet. But I want to hear the rest of your story first.” “Right, well. Ritchie wasn’t doing much. He dropped out of school to so-called help me with my business. But really, he just talked about it during his few shifts a week at the clothing store he worked at. He never got me any business but he still paid himself out for being a ‘representative’ of the brand.” “Fucking egregious.” “I agree!” Lia said brightly. I could tell this story pissed her off but she’d practiced laughing it off over the years. Impressive, considering I couldn’t imagine pulling that off myself. “Long story short, he’d have these lofty dreams about getting rich off this brand. Opening a store in town. Franchising into the city. But he did nothing about it so I told him he needed to get a full-time job, to contribute financially to my costs. And once he did start contributing to the costs, he made me change the recipes and the flavors. He didn’t like ‘exotic’ stuff. And I went with it because I was just so relieved that he was finally footing some of the bills. I didn’t realize how much stress I was putting on myself trying to earn all this money alone.” I watched her long hair spill over her bare shoulder as she tilted her head to the side, sticking her tongue in her cheek. “Of course, I found out far too late that he’d actually quit his job the first week and spent the next ten months secretly playing video games at his best friend’s house from nine to five.” I set my fork down and stared. “What the fuck? Where was he getting the money to make it seem like he had a job?” I asked, enraged. “He took a loan out in my name.” My fists balled. “I’m going to kill him.” She hit me with that fake-it-till-you-make-it smile. “Trust me, I wanted to,” she sang between her teeth. “Really, really badly. I mean we’d been on the rocks for years, honestly. I felt like I was chained to that house. He never let me leave and he was so good at guilting me over everything. But I couldn’t imagine leaving Gail because I knew he wouldn’t really watch over her. So I made excuses for him every day till she – ” Lia broke off for a second. When her voice came back, it wavered. “Every day till she died,” she finished hastily. I ran my hand over my face. I didn’t have to say I was sorry again because I knew she knew. “Um.” Lia’s brows pinched together as her voice darkened. “That actually happened recently.” She looked down in her lap. “Two-and-a-half years ago. I found out about Ritchie’s lies and my destroyed credit barely two weeks before Gail died. I broke up with Ritchie the day of her funeral. It felt like my life changed all at once, without any warning.” “When it rains, it pours.” “Exactly. It all went nuts at once but it was a long time coming. I realized there was only one reason I stayed with Ritchie for so long and it was her. And my friends hated me for that. They thought I was a monster for leaving him right after his mom died but…” Her eyes were misty as she shrugged. “I had to. Or else I’d never have my own life. I would’ve never grown up or known anything besides… basically the kitchen in that house, the inside of Gail’s car and the tiny grocery store down the block. That was all I had for so long.” Drawing in a deep breath, she closed her eyes. And when she exhaled and opened them again, the tears remained but her voice was steady. “But that’s the story. I left him, I lost my little starter business to him since so much was under his name and I came here because I reached out to everyone I knew looking for a place to stay. And I mean everyone.” I was still reeling from her story but I felt a hint of a smile return to my lips. “And how exactly did you find my sister’s townhouse?” The sound of her laugh lifted my heart. “Oh, it’s so Tess. She’d just booted both her tenants at once – couples, I believe – for being loud and always fighting and making tons of noise. Basically, she bit the bullet for years with them and then one day just lost it. Does that sound like her?” “Painfully so.” “Right, so once she kicked them out, she rented the lower level
 to Rachel, who was a friend of her friend. And Rachel told everyone at her work about the great deal some sweet girl was giving for a beautiful apartment in Gramercy. And someone she worked with happened to be my cousin’s Facebook friend.” “Is that the friend you were with at the café when Julian overheard you talking?” “Is that his name?” Lia squinted and rolled her eyes. But she laughed when I did. “Ugh. But yes, that’s her. Sara. She commented on my cousin’s Facebook post asking about affordable rooms anywhere for a relative in a tough spot. My cousin told me about the apartment. I wrote a long, personal email to Tess before I even met her, just begging her to hold that space for me. And the rest is history.” “Damn,” I sat back to process it all. “That’s some good timing. I just figured she found you the way she found the one who lives downstairs.” “Not quite. I found her. And I thank God basically every day that I did.” “She honestly says the same about you,” I grinned. When Lia cocked her head at me, I gave a chuckle. “Don’t worry, I didn’t know much about you before I met you. All I knew was that the second floor neighbor in Tess’s building saved her ass a lot. She can be a bit of a disaster sometimes but…” I trailed off. “But it’s probably my fault so apologies on her behalf.” “Why is it your fault?” she asked. I stared at the flame between us on the table. I didn’t even know where to begin with that answer. It started with our parents, of course, and it ended with Cam. But there was so much in between. So many mistakes, so many lives ruined that I couldn’t bring myself to think about it despite the fact that I’d promised an even exchange with Lia. But I liked keeping her as my bright spot. She was my distraction from the darkness – the complete shitstorm that should be my life right now. The shit with Cam happened, there was Tess to worry about and of course, it was May. It was the hardest month of the year for my sister and me and normally, around this time, I’d be spiraling into my week of self-destruction as I waited for the Twenty-Third to come and go. But I wasn’t the dark cloud I usually was this month. And I had a feeling it had least some to do with Lia. “Fuck.” I looked at her. “If I ask you something, will you promise not to kill me?” “No.” There was no reason for that answer to charm me but it did. “I’m wondering if I can give you a rain check on the Cam story. I know I said I’d tell you, but I can’t do it tonight.” “Are you serious?” The eyes she gave me were big and comically sad but I didn’t give in. “That’s not fair. I only told you about me because I thought I’d hear about you.” “You can hear about me,” I smirked. “You’ll just have to wait another day.” “Nuh-uh. Are you asking me out on a second date?” “I thought this wasn’t a date.” “Fine. Are you asking me out on a second foreplay?” “Yes.” Her lips turned up. “I don’t know. We’ll see. Maybe I don’t need to hear about Cam. It’s probably for the better, anyway,” she said as our plates were swiftly switched out for the second course. “Yeah? How so?” “The conversation was starting to get way too date-like,” she said, eyeing me flirtatiously while sipping her wine. “And like I said – ” “It’s not a date. Fine. So let me turn this conversation toward foreplay,” I said, taking a drink of my own. “Might as well work toward what this night’s about. Right?” She was cautious but played it off. Light bounced off those gorgeous shoulders as she shrugged them and said, “Sure.” She kept her eyes on me as she took another drink, licking the drop of red that clung to her lips. “What do you want to talk about?” “I want to talk about what you like in bed. You said you wanted to do tonight exactly as you wanted so tell me what you want,” I said. I expected to see Lia squirm with discomfort but apparently she was over that. She just waited for the table beside us to leave before she answered. “Well, you fulfilled my first fantasy last night.” “When I ate your pussy?” She gulped. “Yes.” “Was that your first time?” “Might as well have been,” she sniffed. “Don’t give me the details of his incompetence. What else have you always wanted?” I asked. She stroked the stem of her wine glass. “I don’t know.” “Yes, you do. Tell me what it is and I’ll give it to you,” I said with gravel in my voice – the same conviction I had when I told Cam he’d never work again. I liked using it for this purpose better. The sound got that pink in Lia’s cheeks that I liked, and it made her bite her lip as she shifted in her seat. “I guess I’ve always wanted to feel a little risk. I’ve always wanted to fuck somewhere besides the bed. I’ve always wanted it… a little harder than he was willing to give.” She drew the tip of her tongue over her lips. “I’ve always wanted to try being on top.” “Fucking Christ,” I groaned, signaling the waiter so I could ask for the check. “Don’t you dare!” Lia giggled. The sound alone sent blood rushing to my cock. “We still have dessert. I’m not missing crème brulee.” “Fine. You can eat it while I bend you over this table and lick your pussy.” “Lukas! Not so loud.” “I don’t care. I need to put my hands all over you.” “And you can. Anywhere you want.” The naughty flicker in her eye made me groan. “You just have to wait till after dessert.” She was enjoying the power she had over me right now. It had me resentful and turned on at the same time. “Apologies in advance,” I said as the server came to clear our plates. “For what?” “Ripping your dress tonight.” She was quiet till the server left. “Well, you’ve already ruined my panties.” Fuck, this girl. I bounced my knee and tugged my bottom lip. The sweetest, most fucking mischievous amusement bubbled from her lips as she watched me embody torment. For the enjoyment on her face, I planned on fucking her even harder tonight. I was going to have her clawing the sheets off her bed as she felt my balls pressed up hard against her ass. If only she knew. If only she knew how many times I’d fantasized about her. How many times I woke up already thinking about what I wanted to do to her, probably because I’d dreamt about her. Where else would I have gotten such vivid images of fucking her up against a wall? “It’s delicious,” Lia murmured to the server when he came around to ask about the crème brulee. Ignoring mine, I watched her tap the burnt sugar of hers. I signed the check with my eyes trained on her lips. Just watching them wrap around the head of the spoon had my balls churning so hard I growled and got up. “I can’t look at you anymore. I’m going to wait in the car,” I said. I heard that giggle again as I walked out. Fucking hell. She was going to get it.            10      LIA   I crashed against my door, struggling with the keys as Lukas buried his face in the crook of my neck. From behind, he put his hands all over me, one gathering the skirt of my dress in a fist and the other yanking my panties down to my thighs. “Lukas,” I gasped when with a short jerk, he tore the lace clean off my legs. “Sorry,” he muttered into my neck, not sorry at all. My mouth fell slowly open as I felt his rough tongue on my skin and his fingers sliding between my wet folds. “Take your dress off.” “Are you crazy?” “I want to see you naked in this hallway.” “Lukas…” I was struggling more than ever with my keys now because a part of me wanted that too. I wanted a new experience. A risk. So before I knew it, my dress was in a heap on the floor. I was completely naked in my hall, heart pounding and gasping for air because Lukas had me surrounded, one arm circling my front to play with my clit and the other pumping two fingers into my pussy from behind. “Holy shit,” I whispered. In my pleasure, I wanted nothing more than to close my eyes but I forced myself to keep them open. I was in my hallway for God’s sake – ass naked outside my apartment. Rachel could walk up here any second and catch me with my clothes on the floor, Lukas’s fingers stroking and pumping inside me at the same time. “Lukas…” Holy God, it felt so good but I knew it was wrong. “We can’t do this out here…” “Do you want me to stop?” I groaned. “No. I don’t ever want you to stop.” With a raspy chuckle, he kept going. Trailing kisses along my shoulders, Lukas kept his rhythm inside me, two fingers rubbing my clit as the other two pumped deeper inside me. He grinned against my skin as I dropped my keys, flattening both hands on my door, doing my best to keep my moans contained as he slowly but surely picked up the pace. Every time I thought I’d found my limit, he pushed me just a bit more till my legs were parted wide and he was slamming his long fingers inside me. “Mmm.” Lukas rumbled from deep in his chest. “Do you hear how wet your pussy is? You’re fucking dripping, Lia.” “Your fault,” I whispered shakily. I could hardly talk anymore. I’d been seconds from coming for what felt like a minute but I forced myself to hold back because I didn’t want to get caught. At the same time, the risk of it made my skin burn hotter. My sexy clench tighter. Everything about this moment was so taboo and unreal it felt like I was in a dirty dream. My nails clawed against my door, my naked breasts shaking in front of me as Lukas growled against my skin, his fingers fucking me so hard my orgasm took barely a second to mount. But just before I could explode, Lukas pulled away. “Lukas!” I was smacking him in seconds, facing him and his filthy smirk as he reached down for my keys on the floor, kissing my naked hipbone on his way up. “Fuck you,” I hissed as he sandwiched me between his chest and my door. He multitasked like a champ as he slid my key in the lock, his free hand cupping my breast and pushing it up for his mouth. He forced the moan to spill from my lips as he leaned in and swirled his tongue around my nipple, kneading my breast hard as he turned the key in the lock. Sensation of every kind
 poured over me as he carried me into my apartment, leaving my clothes out in the hall as he kicked the door shut. “Take your clothes off,” I demanded when he set me down on the couch. I chewed my little grin back as I watched Lukas undo his belt, the sound of heavy metal jangling heightening my excitement. “Good girl,” he murmured as I sucked my bottom lip and touched myself, watching him push his pants down to reveal black boxer briefs wrapped around muscled thighs and an impressively stiff cock. “Shit,” I exhaled when he took it out, giving me no time to prepare myself for his every pulsing, hard inch. He let his shaft rest heavy in his hand as I stared at it, in awe. “Fuck, you look so cute right now,” he murmured, kicking out of his pants and furiously unbuttoning his shirt. And before I knew it, I was staring at Lukas Hendricks completely naked. I almost forgot how to breathe. Those massive shoulders, those carved pecs – I’d never seen a body like this up close in person. Ever. In fact, I wasn’t sure they were real but kneeling at the edge of my couch, dragging my eyes over every inch of his skin, I couldn’t doubt it any longer. Beauty like this existed and not only that, it wanted me back. It was a dangerous thing to know. “Lia,” Lukas growled. “Tell me what you want. I can’t just look at you like this. I need to fuck you. I need to put my hands all over you.” “Wait,” I whispered, a mischievous grin curling my lips as I studied him. His breathing was increasingly jagged as he watched me watch him and it made every cut line in his six-pack deepen. I let my gaze trickle down every carved section till I was at his hipbones. Good God, that V. It was perfect – cut so viciously deep I wanted to just grab a hold of it and climb him like a fucking rock. “Lia…” “Ah ah.” I peered up at Lukas. On a regular basis, I had zero sadistic tendencies but tonight, I was having fun tormenting Lukas. “We had a deal. You got your way the other night. I get my way tonight.” He groaned, dragging his palm over his jaw, looking pissed off and turned on as he watched me take him in while stroking between my legs. I’d never felt myself this wet before. I couldn’t believe this was really happening and it was precisely why I needed a moment to soak it all in. Because after tonight, I was done. I was to get my fill tonight, get it out of my system and carry on with my life. That was the plan. In fact, I’d promised Sara that after letting him catch his breath for ten minutes, I’d kick Lukas right out of my house. There was to be no getting attached. Absolutely none. So in the time I had, I was going to thoroughly enjoy myself. “Come closer,” I murmured, grinning as Lukas thrust a hand in my hair, standing close enough for me to kiss the tip of his dick if I wanted to. And I did. But not just yet. “Oh fuck, Lia,” he groaned as I brushed my fingertips along his shaft. Still on my knees, I spread them wider, giving Lukas a better view of my pussy as I touched him and myself at the same time. Sliding a finger into my pussy, I wrapped my hand around his cock, feeling its smooth heat under my skin. My thumb rubbed the pre-cum beading at his swollen tip, spreading its stickiness with a naughty smile on my lips. “Jesus fuck, Lia.” Lukas’s hand on my hair tightened. “I don’t know what the fuck you’re doing to me, but you’re killing me, baby,” he growled as I peered up at him from under my lashes. “Fuck, you’re so beautiful,” he murmured, staring deep into my eyes. “I swear to Christ, it doesn’t get better than this.” “Try again,” I murmured, leaning forward to wrap my lips around the head of his cock. Holy shit, I thought as he let out the sexiest, most guttural groan I’d ever heard. He gripped another handful of my hair as I worked my tongue over him, taking him into my mouth inch by inch. I wasn’t sure what had come over me – all I knew was that I needed to taste him, to get all my cravings out in one shot. It felt crazy but it also felt unbelievably good – like I was liberating something inside me that I’d blithely ignored for so long. I wasn't even sure this part of me still existed but if there were any doubts about the filth, the heat and the need that still lived inside me, they were dashed as I felt my tongue gliding along the hot underside of Lukas’s cock, my hand pumping the length of him I couldn’t suck. My mouth full, I peered up at him, watching him stare down at me with his strong body stiff and rigid but his eyes frenzied with pure lust. “You’re fucking amazing, Lia,” he rasped, watching me in awe. “That feels so good, baby... so fucking good. Keep sucking it. Just like that.” I ran my hands down to his hipbones, my fingertips pulsing against those deep cuts of muscle as I took even more of him between my lips. I closed my eyes, whimpering with pleasure as I felt him reach down and fondle my breasts, pinching my nipple till I let out a short, muffled cry. “Mm.” The dirty chuckle he gave me turned me on so much I slid my mouth off his cock and pushed off his body. “Sit down,” I said, eyeing his pants in a heap on the floor. “Put the condom on.” I caught a flash of his raised eyebrows before he swiped his pants off the floor, grabbed the condom inside and did exactly as he was told. Of course he went slightly rogue as he grabbed me and easily lifted me onto his lap, burying his face in my breasts as he rolled the rubber onto his shaft. “Slow, baby,” he murmured as I straddled his cock. He held my hips, his eyes pinned on mine as I lowered myself onto him, my mouth parting little by little as I felt his head nudge against my pussy. We were unblinking as we gazed at one another, our grins spreading in a slow unison as I eased just the tip of his cock inside me. “Oh God,” I breathed out, watching his eyes squeeze shut as I clenched. “That feels so good already,” I whispered just before I sank down the rest of the way. I cried out just as he fisted my hips and growled something fierce and thick with lust. I knew he was half a second from bouncing me furiously on top of his cock but he stopped himself. “Ride me,” he murmured, clenching his teeth. “Let me see you ride my cock, Lia.” I swiveled my hips over him, giving a moan for every new sensation flooding my senses. I was filled to the hilt, stretched around him with unbelievable pleasure and just the right amount of pain. Gripping the back of the couch, I leaned into his chest, feeling his lips dot kisses all over my shoulders as I began to ride him slowly. I whimpered as I picked up my pace and though I could hear the surge of pleasure in his grunts, he murmured “easy,” trying for my own sake to slow me down. I ignored him. In fact, I went faster. I was so damned wet the hint of pain somehow felt good and as I rode him faster, harder it went away, replaced by bliss. “Holy fucking shit, look at you, baby,” Lukas growled as I arched my body. My hair grazed my lower back as I bounced on him. My eyes were closed as I moaned to the ceiling but I didn’t need to see to know that he was staring at me in awe. I could feel the heat of his eyes on my swollen lips, my bouncing breasts, my pussy slamming with fury down to the base of his cock. I could feel his amazement in the way he gripped my ass, his fingers digging into me as he gave deep, animal-like growls. “So fucking sexy.” Lukas pushed his hands up to my tits and squeezed. “You’re the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I never want to stop watching you. You’re fucking beautiful.” As he murmured the words in my ear, I shuddered on top of him, a ripple of pleasure crashing through me. It was so good I would’ve thought I’d come if it weren’t for the true orgasm Lukas had shown me with his tongue in my pussy last night. Coming to a halt, he took over with a gruff command. “Come here.” I was only vaguely aware of Lukas lifting me up as we kissed, his strong arms carrying me like a feather somewhere. I had no idea where. All I knew was that my hot back pressed against the cold wall, our desperate groans mingling as he fucked me against it, rough and merciless. “That feel good?” Lukas grunted, pounding into me. I moaned my reply, too lost in pleasure to articulate a single word. It just felt too damned good. All over. His abs were rubbing against my clit now, stroking hard as his cock rubbed a deliciously sensitive spot inside me. It was more ecstasy than I could process and it got better ever second, hotter with every bit of cocky filth he murmured in my ear. “Such a wet little pussy… such a sweet, fucking wet little pussy. Only for me.” He shoved inside me now. “Only for me, baby. You keep that pussy wet.” He threw his weight against me. “But only for me.” He was buried inside me. Balls-deep. “You hear me? Only for me.” I knew he could feel me clenching around him now because he was teasing me, withholding my orgasm like the prick that he was. “Tell me, Lia,” Lukas murmured into my neck. “Tell me how wet your pussy gets for me. And only me.” “Only you…” I moaned, digging my nails into his back. “Only you get my pussy this wet, Lukas… only you… please…” “What do you want?” He slowed inside me. “Tell me.” “Fuck me,” I begged. “Harder.” “Are you going to come for me?” He pumped his hips faster, deeper. “Yes…” “Open your eyes, Lia. Let me look at you,” he murmured. My fingers immediately raked into his hair when I opened my eyes and caught those pools of green smoldering into me, glinting with pleasure as he continued his measured thrusts inside me. Fuck. It felt amazing but it felt too hot. Too intimate. I looked away but Lukas caught my jaw, grinning at the awe on my face as I processed him pinning me to the wall with just his hips and his cock. “You’re going to look at me when I make you come, you hear me?” “Yes.” With that he released my jaw, grabbing my thighs and building his pace till he was hammering inside me, rocking me so hard against
 that wall I was sure we’d break it down. I couldn’t control the moan that dispelled from my lungs. My nails clawed at his back but his muscles fought back, rippling against me as his cock battered inside me, growing bigger, harder just seconds before he exploded. “Fuck!” Lukas snarled, slamming me into the wall as he came. I felt his heart pound against mine for the next minute that we caught our breaths. My vision focused so that I realized where the hell I even was in my apartment. I couldn’t let go of his shoulder blades. I told myself to but I loved how strong and defiant they felt under my fingers. I wanted to savor how this felt. How he sounded. I wanted to record this for my memories, so I’d never forget how I’d rendered such a strong man weak. “Holy fuck,” he exhaled, pulling back and staring into my eyes as he walked me back to the couch. He sat us down, still inside me. It was once again too intimate as we spent a silent moment gazing at each other. Perspiration beaded his hairline. His cheeks were a little flushed and his parted lips lifted into a faint smile as I ran my hands down his chest and abs. I hated that I loved watching him. Touching him. I couldn’t get enough. And I hated that while I resisted at first, I let Lukas kiss me again. On the couch, naked and sweaty, we kissed for another half hour, maybe more. We eventually fell asleep on the couch and when I woke up hours later to him carrying me to bed, I promised myself I’d kick him out an hour later. I even set an alarm. Even in my grogginess, I remembered the promise I’d made. But the second I felt my body nestle back against his I knew I was screwed.            11      LIA   I hugged the sheet to my chest as I sat upright in bed. I wanted to blame my phone for failing me but apparently, my alarm had gone off fine. I’d just hit snooze a thousand times and because of that, I now found myself staring at the most gorgeous dilemma I’d ever faced in my life. Lukas Hendricks naked. In my bed. Still asleep. “Damn it, Lia,” I whispered to myself as I slipped carefully out of bed, swiping my robe off the wall and wrapping it around my body as I kept my eyes glued to the naked perfection stretched out on my mattress. It would be creepy to take a picture right? Yes. It would. Don’t do it. Maybe it would’ve been halfway acceptable if he was in any way covered but he wasn’t. He was on his back, both arms over his head and his head tilted so that his gorgeous lips were an inch from his left bicep. I would’ve been hung up on the fact that it looked like he was flexing in his fucking sleep, but there was a much more pressing matter that required my attention and that was his completely naked lower half. As he slept, his legs were slightly spread, his cock resting against his abs. Good God. It was like he never took a second off from being ridiculously hot. Flustered, I grabbed my phone and went into the bathroom, furiously texting Sara as I brushed my teeth as quietly as possible.    ME: Hi hello 911 I forgot to kick him out    Within seconds, she was calling me but I promptly hung up and sent another furious text.   ME: Remember how I said I forgot to kick him out?? That means he’s still here so I can’t talk!!! SARA: SORRY. Omg how was it how was last night? ME: Too good ME: Way too good ME: He’s still here. He’s sleeping (adorably) and I don’t know how to kick him out. SARA: Your use of the word adorably tells me the getting attached to him ship has already sailed…   Following that text was a collection of smug emojis that made my cheeks burn. Biting down hard on my toothbrush, I fired back with a two-hand text.   ME: WOMAN are you hoping for that because you find all this amusing???? Stop being the devil on my shoulder ASAP. Angel mode activated NOW SARA: Fine. SARA: Just nudge him lightly, say thanks for last night but I gotta get my day started. If he asks when he’ll see you again say you can’t afford to do this anymore. It was amazing but you’re a busy gal. ME: What if he asks for a morning quickie? SARA: Tell him no? ME: He’s hard as a rock right now. SARA: Sounds hot. SARA: Also sounds like you’re the one who wants the morning quickie   I was in the midst of hunting down every anguished emoji I could find when I heard stirring by the bed. Shit. Forgetting my texts, I went outside just in time to catch Lukas in the living room, stretching his boxer briefs over his dick. He smirked when he looked up to catch me staring like a dumbstruck cartoon, my toothbrush hanging out the corner of my mouth. “Morning,” he said humorously. “Hi,” I returned curtly before disappearing back into the bathroom and closing the door. In a rush, I spit out my toothpaste and splashed water on my face, rubbing away the day-old makeup and combing my hands through my hair. I flipped it nine thousand ways before getting it to look anything but limp and with a deep breath, finally went back outside. I sucked in a sharp breath when I found myself immediately facing Lukas’s pecs. “Hi,” he laughed. “Hi again,” I said, my eyes slowly following Lukas’s hand as he hooked a finger into the knot of my robe and pulled. “Nuh-uh,” I shook my head, blushing as I tied it back. “Fine.” He sucked a breath between his teeth and adjusted his dick. “So. About last night.” “Thank you for it,” I blurted awkwardly, remembering Sara’s advice and executing it like crap. “I have to get going though.” “Get going? This is your apartment.” “I mean I need to get my day started.” “What do you got today?” Just thinking about it sobered me up. “A lot,” I said, heading for the kitchen. “I need to write up a business proposal for a potential investor and I need to email some other realtors since the last one I met won’t get back to me anymore.” Lukas frowned. “Why?” I looked at him. Because I was too busy thinking about the first time you kissed me to make full sentences when I met her. “I don’t know,” I shrugged as I made my way to the kitchen. “I guess she’s busy.” “You know I work in real estate right?” I glanced over the counter at Lukas. His shoulders broadened as he leaned against it. I tore my eyes off them. “I do know that. I may or may not have Googled you the night I met you. Just to see what the hell I might be dealing with here.” “Shit,” he grinned. “Well if you saw any headlines about any particularly insane nights I had, it was Emmett’s fault.” “Is that your go-to move? Blame Emmett?” “Yes,” Lukas deadpanned, reaching for the coffee tin I was struggling with. He twisted it open easily and handed it back. “To be fair, he’d proudly take all the blame.” I smirked, spooning four heaping tablespoons into my pour over. “How do you know him and Julian, anyway?” I asked. From what I gathered, Emmett was a party boy. Julian seemed much more quiet and controlled. “They both seem so different from you.” “Good,” Lukas laughed. “I don’t want to know that I’m any bit like either of them. I met Emmett in college. Julian’s his older brother so I met him shortly after.” “I see. Where did you go to school?” “Wharton.” “Jesus.” I raised my eyebrows. “What, you thought I was all brawn and no brain?” “I mean you are a lot of brawn,” I couldn’t help but note as I grabbed my kettle and poured hot water over my coffee. I avoided Lukas’s grin as I remembered how he carried my weight like it was nothing and fucked me against the wall last night. Crap. Stop. None of that, I told myself, quickly changing the subject. “And Emmett went to Wharton too?” “No. He played football. He was a friend of Cam’s.” “Ah.” I arched an eyebrow. It wasn’t till I grabbed two mugs off the wall that I realized I’d subconsciously made two cups of coffee. “That reminds me, you still owe me a Cam story.” Lukas laughed. “I thought you had to get your day started?” “I will after you tell me what kind of worthless, gold digging bitch Cam is.” “God, the sound of you berating him gets me kind of hard.” “Shut up,” I snorted as I grabbed cream from the fridge. “Cream or black?” “Black,” he answered as I slid his cup of coffee across the counter. He gazed down at it for a second before looking back up at me with a smile that anticipated my answer to the question he hadn’t even asked yet. “What?” I narrowed my eyes at him. “Will you let me make you breakfast?” The offer made my heart skip a beat but I didn’t let it show. “No.” “Why not?” “Because. I’m already pushing it by letting you stay for coffee.” “What are you pushing?” I paused for a moment then heaved a sigh. “This is supposed to be a one-night thing, Lukas,” I confessed, peering up to catch him raising an eyebrow. “I didn’t realize.” “Well, I didn’t tell you. I just planned on making it that way,” I said, hoping my bluntness would remind me of my mission here. Have sex. Be done. Move on. But Lukas was making that difficult for me. “Certainly a first for me,” he smiled, studying me in the way that got my neck hot as hell. “But as much as it turns me on to think that you used me for sex, I’m not quite done with you here.” “Oh, no?” “Not even close.” “Well, too bad it’s not up to you.” Lukas grinned. “You’ll want me again.” “I won’t.” “You already do. I can see it,” he said as I shook my head. “In all seriousness, Lia, your poker face is shit. Remind me to never take you to Vegas.” I laughed but chucked the cap of my cream at his head. “For that, you have to chug your coffee in ten seconds and leave.” “Fuck that. I’m making your ass a French omelet,” Lukas said, rounding the counter and snorting as I tried to push him out. Oh God. My hands on his chest was always a bad idea. He was just so fucking hard it was unreal. “What are you tryin’ to do, huh?” Lukas teased, gathering my hand and holding them behind my back with one of his. Heat bloomed in my cheeks as he held me still and taunted me with kisses on my neck, pushing my robe open again and feathering them down the curve of my breast. With a low mm
 from his chest, he flicked his tongue over my nipple. My mouth fell open as he gave a quick suck. But just as quickly as the moment happened, it stopped. “Last three,” he said, taking the eggs from my fridge. “I’m using them.” I blinked as I watched him, still recovering as he grabbed a skillet off the back burner and placed it up front. Damn it. Did that just happen? What the fuck was that? I asked myself, all hot and bothered as I watched Lukas cook for me half-naked, a Greek statue whisking eggs with a fork. I was so entranced by the knot that twitched in his forearm that I missed the first few sentences of what he was saying about Cam. “Bored already?” Lukas laughed when he caught me. “See, I knew I shouldn’t tell you about that asshole.” “No, tell me,” I urged. “I’m curious and you’re already making me a damned omelet so spill.” “Fine. But you’re getting the condensed version,” Lukas said, pouring the egg over the melted butter and whisking the fork like lightning in the pan. “First things first, I started my company with Cam out of college. I needed cash fast to get out of the shit I was in. I had mouths to feed and Cam’s connections presented a huge opportunity, so I went for it,” he said, rattling his story off fast, like a business pitch. “His dad was in the NFL. His uncle was an agent for every major sport. Cam had a network of athletes. I had the drive and business savvy. I was twenty-four when I started Hendricks-Cameron and the first thing I did was target pro athletes.” Lukas shook the skillet to gently fold the omelet. He grabbed the plate I handed him and flipped onto it a perfect, soft mound of pale golden egg. I was in awe of how quickly he’d done it but I refused to marvel because I felt like it was a trick – like he was trying to distract me from the story he was telling. “Six years ago, I sold the biggest free agent in baseball a twenty-million dollar penthouse on the Upper West Side. Fifty-five hundred square feet with three hundred-sixty degree views of Manhattan. I had the media cover it and convinced my client to do a TV special. Made sure it mentioned my company name at least four times and from that point forward, Hendricks-Cameron became the go-to agency for New York athletes. I had more success than I knew what to do with. Suddenly, I didn’t have to worry about my family anymore and the truth was that I couldn’t have done it without Cam’s connections, so…” Lukas trailed off. I could see the hollows of his cheeks flexing as he clenched his jaw for a bit. “Over the years, I let him get away with things that I shouldn’t have. I let him do more damage behind my back than I could ever dream of fixing all at once and it was my mistake for looking past the warning signs. In short, I fucked up. For a lot of people, not just me.” I frowned. He was being vague and I wanted to pry, but I held back. “It’s not your fault,” I said. He peered up at me with a faintly curious smile. “No?” I shrugged. “No. It’s natural to feel like you owe the person who helped you during your darkest times. Sometimes it’s the right person who got the chance to help you and other times, it’s someone who’ll take advantage of your debt.” I heaved a big sigh as I thought about Ritchie. “I mean what can you really do about it? Bad people do good things sometimes. And it tricks you.” Lukas was silent for a moment. I could see a million thoughts swirling behind those green eyes as he gazed at me but when he broke the silence, it was with two words. “You’re right.” “But hey,” I tried to keep it light. “Better late than never that you kick them to the curb.” Lukas studied me for a moment. “I put Cam in the emergency room.” My eyebrows darted up. “Oh.” I tried thinking of something else to say but I came up empty. “You think I’m a monster now,” he said, almost matter-of-fact. “Not at all,” I said truthfully. “I wish I put Ritchie in the emergency room,” I said, finding myself laughing with Lukas. “Trust me, I’ve spent many nights fantasizing about getting back at him – at all of them, really. All my friends from home said that I owed any success I had to Ritchie. That I couldn’t have done anything without him and that I’d never succeed by myself in this city. So sometimes I think I’m only this hungry for success because I want revenge. I couldn’t put Ritchie in the ER like you did to Cam,” I smirked, “so at the very least, I’d like to prove him wrong by doing well for myself. I just can’t stand when assholes get to go on in life thinking they’re right. I need the record set straight. You know?” “Oh, I know,” Lukas smiled. “And if it helps your craving for justice, you’ll be happy to hear that I bought Cam out of the company about a month ago. I offered him a ridiculous chunk of cash so he’d sign the contract without thinking. He didn’t realize till it was too late that I’d fucked him over beyond repair,” he said, handing me a fork and nodding at the omelet on my plate. “Don’t let it get cold.” I stared. “Are you going to tell me exactly what he did? I feel like you’re leaving out a lot of details here.” “I am. Now eat.” I squinted as I took a bite of the omelet but my eyes popped back open when I felt the silkiness that glided over my tongue. “These are eggs?” I didn’t mean to say it aloud but I did. I stared back down at my plate as Lukas laughed. “Where did you learn how to cook like this?” “My grandmother. Grandma Elodie.” “She’s a chef?” “No. Just French,” Lukas said with a faint smile. “She made us do her mise en place and watch nothing but Jacques Pepin growing up.” “You and Tess?” He paused. “Yes.” I frowned, vaguely remembering something he’d said before that piqued my interest. “Was it just you and Tess growing up?” I asked. Mouths, I recalled. Plural. He said he’d gone into business with Cam because he had “mouths to feed.” I was curious about that detail before and I was even more curious now. But taking another bite, I blinked up to find Lukas ignoring me as he scrubbed the pan in the sink. And just like that I was distracted again. It was hard not to be. He was like a vision from any housewife’s dream – tall, ripped and half-naked while doing my dishes. God, I could get used to this, I thought. But I quickly corrected myself. Nope. You can’t. Take a mental snapshot and move on with your life, I decided. Though instead of taking a mental snapshot, I took an actual one with my phone. “Saw that,” Lukas said, still washing. He grinned when he looked up to catch me blushing. “I’ll let you keep it under one condition.” “What?” “You let me see you again.” Lukas faced me as he dried his hands. “And before that smart mouth tries to make a joke, I mean see you as in take you out, not pass you by in the hall.” My shoulders fell. “Lukas. I told you I have a lot to do today. And every day.” “And I told you I work in real estate. I have every connection you could dream of and I can help you with whatever you need.” “No.” My heartbeat quickened. “I don’t do that.” “Do what?” “Mix business with pleasure. That’s my rule.” “Fine. Then don’t. Get your work done today and let me come over at night to take you anywhere you want.” Lukas said earnestly. I watched as he dried my pan, set it back and wiped up the water around the sink. “We can do dinner and drinks. Or we can catch a game. I get box seats anywhere.” I swallowed. “It’s tempting, Lukas,” I said, backing up as he stepped forward. “But my entire career is banking on this meeting, and it happens in only four days,” I said, shuddering just from saying it aloud. “So whether or not I want to see you is irrelevant because the truth is I can’t afford to. I have a pitch to write and I’ve already spent the past few days being completely distracted.” “Fair enough.” Lukas nodded. “But how about after your meeting? What happens when it’s over?” I thought about it. Butterflies fluttered in my stomach as I considered that I might actually have an investor by then. I might have my official budget for the store I’d been dreaming of opening for years. I shook my head. “I don’t know,” I said quietly. “I can’t even think about it yet. It makes me unbelievably nervous.” Lukas smiled as he watched me chew on my lip. “Alright. Then here’s my pitch to you – I’ll leave you alone till you’re done with your meeting. I won’t knock on your door once. I won’t text or call. I won’t have a single guest over so you can have your guaranteed peace and quiet. But once the next four days are over, we renegotiate our contact agreement because I want to see you and I already know that feeling’s not going away anytime soon,” he said. When I refused to meet his eye, he tipped my chin up to face that sexy grin of his. “Deal?” Damn it. Why was it so fucking impossible to resist him when he was already touching me? “Fine,” I caved, breathing out in frustration at myself. “But if you break the deal and I screw this meeting up, Lukas, I’ll put you in the emergency room.” “Shit. Is that right?” “No. But in all likelihood, I will hate you,” I said, pushing past him to go into the living room. “I’ll probably nosedive into panic about my career and go another three years without sex. And this time, I’ll blame it on you.” “Jesus Christ,” Lukas laughed. “No knocking then. Four days of quiet.” “Starting now,” I added, gathering his clothes from the living room floor. Returning to the kitchen, I thrust the pile in his arms and pushed him swiftly toward the door. “That should be it. Now you gotta go.” “You’re not going to let me get dressed first?” he grinned down at me. “You can afford a three-second walk of shame.” “Fine. But you don’t get to look at my ass on my way out.” “Yeah, well I don’t want to,” I said, my laugh dangerously close to a giggle. Then before the bastard could charm me any further, I opened the door and pushed him right out.            12      LUKAS   There was a stupid grin on my face as I pushed through the
 revolving doors of Hoult Tower. I was an hour late for work but I wasn’t thinking about it. It was still a good morning – even despite the promise I’d just made to Lia. Four days. No contact. It sounded like hell already but the last thing I wanted was to be another asshole on that woman’s shit list. I wasn’t done with her yet. I’d gotten more than a good taste of her last night but I wanted more. I wanted to touch and feel her again but I also just wanted to see her. I wanted to see her nail that meeting. It was partially self-serving since I knew I had no chance of taking her out again if she didn’t get the deal, but I also wanted to see the girl catch a break already. She was probably fucking adorable with a giant smile on her face and nothing to worry about. And as far as I could tell, she deserved it. “Jesus. Someone got laid last night.” I smirked before even turning to confirm Julian following me into the elevator. I watched as he hit ‘door close’ while making eye contact with some poor bastard running toward us to get in. “See, these are the mornings that I hate working in your building. There’s nothing worse than starting your day with a smug billionaire.” “I’m just noting the good mood you’re obviously in.” “Right.” “You look like you just got named prom queen.” “Fuck off,” I laughed. Julian faced forward with a grin. “Hey, doesn’t hurt to chip a little ice off your heart. Pretty soon you could be like Emmett – stupid and happy. Like a Golden Retriever.” “Shoot me if I ever get as chipper as him.” “You have my word,” Julian said, straightening the knot on his tie. “I take it you’re seeing her tonight?” “Lia?” “Who else would I be talking about? She’s all that’s been coming out of your mouth lately. It’s fucking bizarre.” “Well, you’ve seen her.” “I have. She’s hot,” Julian said. I laughed in surprise. It was a two-word admission but coming from Julian, it was a miracle. In terms of dating, my standards were high but his were astronomical. Borderline offensive. In all fairness, he harbored a pretty inhuman addiction to work so as far as women went, only the one percent had a shot at tempting him out of the office. He sucked a breath between his teeth and shook his head to make it clear that Lia fell within that group. “You’re just lucky you saw her first.” “Again, fuck off. And don’t ask me about her till the end of the week. She has to write up a proposal for some big meeting on Friday so I’m barred from distracting her in any way till then.” Julian looked impressed. “Damn. Really does sound like my kind of woman.” “If I catch you looking at her, I’ll kill you.” “It’s already like that? I’m surprised. You’re usually so eager to pass them off to Emmett after one night. To keep them from calling you, correct?” The doors opened to two women who smiled shyly at us. I had no doubt they’d eavesdrop but I still lowered my voice. “There are different rules with this one. Neither of you are to ever go near her. Regardless of how it goes between us.” Julian cocked an eyebrow. “So she’s on the untouchable list.” “Sure.” “I thought only Emmett kept one of those. It’s such a romantic, middle school girl notion,” he smiled. “Guess you’re both getting soft.” “There’s a chance. Being even a little happy will do that to you. You should try it sometime.” “Fuck off,” Julian laughed as the doors opened on my floor. “Get to work, asshole. You’re unbelievably late.” I smirked. “I’ll meet you at The Pike at seven.” The girls in the elevator giggled as I walked out of the elevator and down the marble hall that led to the glass doors of The Hendricks Group. A few weeks ago, the lettering behind reception still read Hendricks-Cameron. Now, I could hardly remember what that looked like. If only I could get rid of Cam as easily as I got rid of his name on the company. Fucking hell. “Is that him on the phone?” I asked the new girl upon walking through the front doors. She nodded, visibly rattled in her chair as she watched Noelle, who’d clearly just taken over the call for her. “I mean it, Cam,” Noelle spoke low but clearly. “You can call from however many numbers you want but if you threaten Ashleigh again, I’ll personally go to the police and – ” She cut off when she spotted me motioning for her to put him through. Holding her hand over the receiver, she hissed at me. “Are you serious? You haven’t talked to him in a month, Luke, and it’s not like he’s gotten rational since. Just hold off for a bit.” “I can handle it today. Put him through.” I heard her heave a sigh before I closed my office door behind me. Talking to Cam for the first time since the buyout was probably the best way to kill a good mood but I wasn’t going to let him harass my staff another day so seating myself behind my desk, I took a breath. He fed off my anger so I wasn’t going to give him any. I’d already ripped him several new assholes the last time we spoke so today, I strained the emotion from my voice before picking up the phone. “Cam.” There was a long pause. It was like he couldn’t believe he’d finally gotten through. “Fucking coward,” he finally hissed, sounding already unhinged. “You fucking piece of shit. You really think you’re going to get away with this? What the hell do you expect me to do with this contract? Huh? How am I supposed to get back on my feet?” I tried not to laugh. “You did this to yourself, Cam. I gave you ample time to read the terms. If you disliked them so much, maybe you shouldn’t have signed.” I’d deliberately taken his legs out from under him with that contract. With the help of Julian’s artfully cunning attorneys, I’d designed it to specifically confuse my former partner – to make him only see the dollar signs. I said the buyout price would be cut in half if he didn’t sign within forty-eight hours, so he did and in the process, he unknowingly forfeited his right to speak to any former clients or employees. All athletes in the tri-state area were off the table, too, and he was to wait twelve months before setting up a new business. In that time, I planned to have him blacklisted by everyone in real estate. Apparently, he’d only just caught on. “You’re fucking unbelievable, Hendricks.” I could actually hear the spittle flying out of Cam’s mouth as he snarled into the phone. “I have my lawyers on this so you should know that unless you decide to get fucking smart and void this contract, I’m suing you.” “I’ve had my countersuit ready for a long time, so by all means. Sue.” He held the phone away and gave a long, comical growl. It sounded like something out of a goddamned Disney movie and if I didn’t know better, I’d laugh. But I did know Cam and I knew that sound generally preceded some sort of low blow – some cheap, last-ditch effort to piss me off. And I was prepared for it. It made my blood fucking boil, but I was prepared to hear him talk about Tess. About how he’d probably laughed behind her back while tricking her all those years. About how he toyed with her, treated her like his own personal doll – his “plaything,” as he liked to call it. But to my surprise, he went in another direction. “I could’ve pressed charges the day you put me in the hospital. But I didn’t.” “I wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that I had you on camera admitting to multiple felonies.” He ignored me. “It was two on one that day. You and Pretty Boy against me.” “If you count Julian holding me back as two against one, then there’s nothing I can do about it.” “Fuck you. You know who’d be really proud of you for resorting to bullying?” he sneered. “That little princess of yours.” “Trust me, Tess was more than happy to hear that I handed your ass to you.” “I’m not talking about Tess. I’m talking about Wyatt.” The blood drained from my face. I gripped the receiver and the room instantly spun at the mention of his name. Motherfucker. My heart slammed against my chest as Cam laughed at my silence. “You know I’m right. Good thing the kid didn’t live to see you become the bully that used to torture him,” Cam sneered with delight. “By the way, what is it today? The Nineteenth? Shit, we’re exactly a week away from the day he decided to – ” I hung up. Rather, I slammed the phone down so hard both girls jumped in their seats outside. My heart was beating so fast I could barely see. I rose to my feet, my mind racing as I started out of my office with no direction in mind. “Stop,” Noelle hissed, pushing me back in as I flung open the door. “Lukas, breathe. Sit down and just breathe.” “I’ll breathe outside. There’s air.” She ignored me and sat me down on my couch, standing over me with her hands on her hips. “Nice try but I’m not going to let you find him and break the rest of his limbs. You’re not going to jail over Cam, okay?” she muttered, pushing back her blonde hair. “And not to say I told you so, but I did say you should wait till after the Twenty-Third to talk to him. You know your head’s just… better once that day passes.” “You’re right.” I nodded vacantly. “My fault.” “Don’t do that with me.” “Do what?” “Act all calm and collected when I know you aren’t. Whether you like to admit it or not, I’m one of the few people you can actually talk to about this shit,” Noelle said. “I’m one of the few people who knows everything about you – you, Tess, Wyatt and your stupid fucking parents.” I glanced up at her. She wasn’t wrong. Noelle had grown up with us in Miami, right next door to our dysfunctional house. She knew the ins and outs of our family – every crack in our dark and broken history. Of course, she also used that knowledge to get in my bed. She knew when I was at my weakest and she knew when to pounce. It was cheap and ugly and precisely why I preferred to keep a distance from most. If knowing my past meant securing some permanent spot in my heart then I wanted the fewest number of people in the know. “I don’t want or need to talk about this, Noelle.
 I never do and you know that.” “I do. But if you’re ever going to open up to someone, shouldn’t it be me?” she asked, sitting across from me on the glass table. “And fine, even if you don’t open up to me, at least let me be the one who makes you feel good. I don’t like when you let someone else have that job,” she pouted in a baby voice. But she dropped the cute act fast when I let several seconds pass without saying anything. “Are you seeing that girl?” “What girl?” “The one who came in looking for her key.” “Whether or not I am is not your business.” Noelle scoffed. “I beg to differ.” “How so?” “Because you’re my business, Lukas.” Noelle glared at me. “I put time into you. I’ve always been there for you. In case you forgot, when you left for college, I was the one who had to listen to Tess’s crazy ass crying all the time, talking about all the shit your parents were putting them through. When you were here starting the company, I was in Philly helping your sister drive Wyatt to school if she was too fucking sad to get out of bed,” she hissed mockingly. “I am the closest thing to a girlfriend that you have ever had, that you’ll ever have and I’ll always know you better than any slut you’re fucking, including the neighbor, so don’t try to push me out of your life because I deserve to be here. I earned my spot here.” My jaw was tight as I stared at Noelle. Zero to sixty. It was her specialty. Ignoring her fiery stare, I got up and returned to my desk, noting that it was too early to call even Emmett for a drink. “You’ve known me most of my life, Noelle. That’s true,” I said once I resumed my seat. “And I’m grateful you were often there for Tess but make no mistake, there’s no debt here. From what I understood, you were kind to my sister because you were her friend – not because you looked forward to me owing you for the rest of my life. I might’ve felt like I did at one point but I don’t anymore.” “And why the hell not?” “Because it’s bullshit,” I fired back. “First off, you begged to help with Tess’s depression. When I moved them to Philly, you begged me to move you there, too, so I could pay you to help around the house,” I said heatedly. “All that aside, only a horrible person would take advantage of someone they were there for during a hard time. Are you telling me you’re that person?” “I’m telling you you’re a fucking prick,” Noelle snapped, getting up and storming out. I watched her then grab her purse and jacket from reception and march right into the elevators, either taking a break or flat-out leaving for the day. It wasn’t something any other employee dared to do but I’d set a bad precedent for Noelle from the start. She was a special case because like Cam, she’d been a part of my life when it was nothing – when I was a college kid struggling with classes, custody and a plan for what the future would be. Pinching the bridge of my nose, I tried to remember what Lia had told me barely a few hours ago. Something about bad people doing good things. But I was too fired up to put my thoughts together so breathing deep, I tried to at least remind myself that this had started out a good day. It had actually been my best morning in a long time and I’d be foolish to pretend it didn’t have to do with my neighbor. “Idiot,” I cursed myself as I stared at the ceiling. Four fucking days. After last night, I knew it’d be hard. Thanks to this morning, it was about to be torture.            13      LIA   I probably looked like a mess but rule one of lockdown mode was never look in the mirror. It was always too startling. “Goddammit,” Sara mumbled to herself, still typing away at her office. “Fuck this stupid printer. If this printer had a life, I would end it.” I laughed. She was still at work and we weren’t really having an active conversation – I just had her on speaker for company. It’d been too long since I’d had contact with another human being. At this point, I’d gone almost seventy-two hours without leaving my apartment. The last time I’d done that was a year ago, when I got my first big order: four hundred hand-painted truffles, each pair individually wrapped to serve as souvenirs for a June Magazine Christmas party. June was the publication Sara wrote for and she’d busted her ass to get me the job over the big company they usually hired. It was a huge opportunity and since it was a last-minute gig, I wound up working nonstop for three days and eating nothing but boiled eggs and trail mix for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was exhausting, kind of gross and probably not great for my health so I swore to never do it again. Yet here I was, doing exactly that to get this business plan written. “Why the fuck do I need yellow ink to print a black and white document?” Sara whispered furiously as I cleared off my kitchen counter, laying out my chocolate, cream, colored cocoa butter and molds. “And why do they turn the heat up so high in this damned office?” “I don’t know. Take your pants off?” “I don’t work from home, Lia, so I can’t show up to work every morning without my pants on. Not everyone’s as lucky as you.” True. I was literally too busy to put pants on the past three days. All I wore was a T-shirt and pajama shorts while buckling down and making that business plan my bitch. The first day of lockdown mode had gone toward writing up an overview of my company. Yesterday had gone toward mapping out industry, customer and competitor analysis. Today, I’d written up my entire marketing plan and having just completed that, I was rewarding myself by relaxing with some cooking before bed. “Lia. Tell me what you’re making so I don’t rage-quit my job right now,” Sara said, tossing something across her desk. It sounded like her mouse. “I’ve got lavender truffles on deck.” “I want that. In my face. What do you use? Real lavender?” “Mm-hm. The flower heads are steeping in the cream right now, so they’ll be infused in the ganache.” “Ugh, you little slut. That sounds so good,” Sara muttered, back to typing furiously. “I need like, four pounds of chocolate to calm me down right now. I’m so cranky.” “Go find your fuck buddy,” I grinned. “That usually helps you get rid of the crankiness.” “Yeah, I would’ve done that already but it’s eight o’clock and he went home two hours ago, like a normal person,” Sara said, drumming her fingers against her desk with that restless energy of hers. “Hey, maybe I should invite the overnight custodian to be my other fuck buddy. That way I could have a day shift one and a night shift one.” I snorted. “Yeah? Is he hot?” “He’s got nice forearms, I’ll give him that,” Sara laughed. “Seriously, though. I don’t know how you do it, Li.” “Do what?” “Focus without needing to physically bang out your frustration sometimes. I’d get so much done if I were you.” “I think that was God evening out the playing field. You’d take over the world if you didn’t need to stop every twelve hours and have sex with someone.” She paused. “I think there was a compliment in there. Somewhere.” “There was,” I giggled but I quieted down fast when I heard the front door of the townhouse swing open downstairs. “Ooh. I gotta go.” “Why? Hottie’s home?” “You know the drill,” I said with a grin. “Okay, bye. Save me a truffle or I’ll hurt you!” “’Kay, bye!” I whispered, hanging up as I listened to Lukas come up the stairs. The first night of our deal, he’d come home to hear me giggling with Sara on the phone. I heard his footsteps pause in the hall and when I went to peek in the peephole, I confirmed him smirking at my door. With a tired laugh and groan, he said, “You’re killing me, Lia,” then disappeared into his apartment. I blushed to myself for probably thirty minutes after that. Last night, it was similar. I’d peeked out into the hallway to see him gaze at my door for a good second before cursing under his breath and going in. It was surprising to me, and I would be lying if I said I wasn’t flattered and charmed. I’d half-expected Lukas to plain forget about me by day one. He had beautiful women of every kind at his beck and call – I really couldn’t imagine that he’d wait several days for me instead of round them up to have multiple threesomes in the penthouse of his favorite hotel. Hearing him approach his door, I tip toed to mine, peeking out into the hall. Damn, I bit my lip when I saw him walking in looking tired but unbelievably sexy with his tie and jacket in his hand, his shirt un-tucked those deft fingers undoing the first few buttons. Shit. I ducked when he peered over his shoulder at me. “I can hear your slippers every time you come to the door,” he said, his voice a mixture of amusement and exhaustion. “You better be working your ass off in there. I heard you giggling on the phone the other night.” “What – I am!” I retorted. “I haven’t left my house in three days!” His door was open now but he leaned back against it to squint at my door. “Are you serious? That’s not healthy,” he laughed incredulously. He cocked his head as if to get a better look at me. “You can’t open the door for a second so I can at least look at you?” he asked. “Trust me, you don’t want to.” He massaged the back of his neck. “Trust me. I can’t think of anything I want more right now,” he said. My cheeks were hot as I bit my lip again. There was surprisingly no flirtation in his statement – it was just matter-of-fact. And somehow, that made me blush even more. I turned away from the peephole and leaned my back against the door. “One more day, Lukas,” I said, if even to remind myself. “You’ve already gone this long without breaking the rules. Don’t do it now.” “Fine. I won’t,” I heard him say. It was quiet for another few seconds as I leaned against my door. But finally I heard Lukas laugh to himself, go inside and close the door. But barely thirty minutes later, there was a knock. “Seriously, Lukas?” I shook my head as I marched over to the door, gathering
 my messy hair into a topknot and securing it haphazardly with a tie. Knotting my robe, I suppressed the smile on my face and swung open the door. “Lukas, didn’t we just – oh!” I blinked when I realized it wasn’t Lukas. The man at my door was about a foot shorter including the chunky bicycle helmet. His look was blank as he held out a paper bag, raising his eyebrows expectantly as he waited for me to take it. “Lia Pope, yes?” “Oh. Yes.” I grabbed it, confused as I examined the bag. “Sorry, what is this?” I asked. But by the time I looked up again, he was gone and Lukas was opening his door. Goddammit. He was barefoot and shirtless, wearing just a pair of grey sweats that hung well below his hips. I stared. Didn’t even try to hide it. He looked good enough to lick. When I looked up, an irresistible grin spread across his lips. “Lukas.” I shook my head. “This has to be breaking the rules.” “Not at all. The rule was that I couldn’t knock. There was nothing about getting a delivery guy to do it for me.” “Hm…” I said to disguise the fact that I was dangerously charmed. "Clever loophole,” I mused, looking into the bag and back up at him. “Wait. Did you just buy me dinner?” I asked, unable to hold back my smile. “Yes.” “You don’t think I can feed myself?” “Not if you haven’t left the house in three days. I saw your fridge the other morning – all you had in there were three eggs and I used them for your omelet.” “True,” I relented, completely thawed at this point. Closing my eyes, I breathed in the steam from the bag. “Mmm. Smells good. I’m not sure what it is but I think I’ll like it.” “You will,” Lukas said with a faint smile. And for a couple seconds, he stood there, gazing at me like I were some picture at a museum. “You alright?” I asked. I wasn’t sure why. Something just felt the slightest bit off. But he recouped fast. “I’m better now,” Lukas said. “But I’ll let you go before your dinner gets cold. It tastes best when it’s hot.” “What is it?” “You’ll know when you see it. It’s from your favorite place,” he grinned, giving a sexy little nod goodbye before stepping back and closing the door. I stared for a bit, confused. But when I retreated back into my apartment, I went straight to tearing into the food he’d ordered me. I couldn’t stop smiling when I saw what it was – paella.            14      LIA   “I look forward to speaking with you very soon.” The line played on repeat in my head as I practically skipped across town from my meeting. Really though – what could that possibly mean besides anything good? I was genuinely trying to answer the question because I wanted desperately to keep my hopes down, or at least at a reasonable level. But I couldn’t. I’d frickin’ killed that meeting and the cherry on top was my creamy lavender truffle tucked into my signature teal box, wrapped in a shiny peach ribbon printed with my name, Pope Chocolates. The product, the branding, my pitch – everything was completely on point and though I had no final word on anything, I needed to celebrate. “You made it!” Sara squealed, her lithe arms outstretched as I angled my way through the crowd at The Margot. The swanky bar hosted her company’s Friday happy hour every week, and Sara had begged me for years to go but I never did. Top shelf open bar sounded like a massive hangover just waiting to happen so I had to decline. But not tonight. Tonight I was giving myself permission to take full advantage. I planned to drink, I planned to dance and I planned to scarf down a 2AM slice of pizza with Sara to cure the drunk munchies. I was giving myself the entire day off tomorrow, so for the next twenty-four hours, I was free. The only thing I didn’t plan to do tonight was text Lukas. I wanted to see him. I couldn’t deny that. He’d charmed my figurative pants off the other night by ordering me paella but I couldn’t afford to be around him this drunk. Whatever attraction I had for him was already too big too fast and I needed to slow it down. And since alcohol was never the key ingredient to slowing anything down, I nixed the idea of inviting him and decided to make it a girls night. “So do you think it’s gonna happen? Do you think you got the deal?” Sara asked, squeezing both my hands so tight I could barely feel them. “I don’t want to jinx it but…” “You totally got it.” I grimaced because I really didn’t want to jinx it but for once, I let myself be nothing but optimistic. “I… think I did.” “Yesss!” Sara squealed so loud half the bar looked at us. I laughed as she forced me to jump up and down with her. “Oh my God, fingers crossed but even if you don’t get it, I’m so fucking proud of you and this calls for all the champagne. Come on!” She tugged urgently on my arm. “We can toast to your new business and I can introduce you to all my coworkers so they stop saying I made you up!” I laughed as we did exactly that, grabbing two flutes of champagne at the packed bar and mingling with all the coworkers who playfully doubted my existence since they’d heard about me for years but never met me. “Honestly, you really seemed like Sara’s imaginary friend because none of us could believe she found someone as work obsessed as her,” giggled Willa, a raven-haired girl Sara described as “one of the good ones” at the office. “We wouldn’t believe you were real if it weren’t for the chocolates Sara brings us on Mondays. Lia, the rum raisin truffle you make? It might be the best thing I’ve ever tasted.” “Thank you so much!” I said, blushing as a couple others chimed in about the “fucking divine” truffles of mine that Sara was known to bring in to work from time to time. I was normally squirmy and uncomfortable when it came to accepting compliments but for some reason, I was reveling in them tonight. I felt deserving of them for once – bright, happy and confident in a way I was pretty sure I’d never felt before tonight. Before this week. Surrounded by Sara and her favorite coworkers, we toasted to my “ninety-nine-percent-sure-gonna-happen” deal and the good vibes went on strong for the next hour or so – right up till the moment I heard a familiar voice shriek in my ear. “Whoa, am I wasted or is Lia Pope out on a Friday night?” Oh… no. I turned to find my first-floor neighbor, Rachel, holding her mouth wide open as she came in for the hug. I was tipsy so I let her bring it in, flashing a warning look over her shoulder at Sara, who was already rolling her eyes and retching. She’d worked with Rachel at June Magazine for years before I moved to New York and it was only through Rachel that I found my apartment. But once I did start my lease, she apparently griped for weeks that her landlord chose some “boring goody two shoes” to rent the second-floor unit, instead of one of her “fun, cute friends.” Obviously, Sara didn’t take kindly to it and called her out in front of their coworkers multiple times, which led to a few awkward run-ins with Rachel for me at home. Lucky for me, she had her own entrance to the townhouse so we didn’t run into each other often. Of course when we did, she tried to pressure me out of my lease, saying I didn’t need such a “centrally located apartment” since I never went out. In summary, Rachel kind of sucked and I was already anticipating some sort of passive aggressive remark as she held my shoulders and cooed at me. “Aww, you even got dressed up. Is that a one-inch heel I see on those flats? Damn, girl. Livin’ wild!” she giggled, giving my arm a little smack. “So what finally brings you out tonight? You’re like, literally the least social person I’ve ever met in my life.” I flashed a strained smile and ignored her not-so-veiled insult. “Well, you know. Just had a good workday and now I’m rewarding myself with a little – ” “Sunlight? Some actual vitamin D?” Rachel cracked. “That’s good, ‘cause you definitely need it. And while you’re at it, you should get yourself some actual D. As in dick?” “Yes, thank you, Rachel. It was an extremely sophisticated joke, but we got that,” Sara said as she handed me a much-needed shot of vodka. Rachel smacked her arm. “Am I not right though? We should hook her up with one of the interns. They’re cute and they’re like, nineteen,” she said, turning back to me and winking as she sucked on her straw. “They won’t even be able to tell if you don’t know what you’re doing.” “Wow. Very kind offer, Rachel, but I think I’ll decline,” I said dryly. “Why? It’s been ages for you and beggars can’t be choosers.” Sara cleared her throat. “Actually,” she started in a tone I both recognized and feared. She ignored the death look I flashed her to flash a dazzlingly fake smile at Rachel. “Lia might just have the most interesting sex life out of all of right now. And by ‘might’ I mean ‘definitely’,” she said, turning back to me with a look that wordlessly begged for permission to spill. I shook my head adamantly, mouthing a clear no as Rachel let out a snort. “Mm… doubtful.” It irked me but I was much more inclined to let her be smug than brag about something completely uncertain. I’d slept with Lukas once. For all I knew, he would forget about me in a week. He might even move on to sleeping with Rachel. I made a face as the thought twisted something in my stomach. “See? Look how uncomfortable she still gets about sex,” Rachel giggled as Sara groaned and nudged me hard for permission. When I ignored her, she huffed and turned away to furiously text on her phone. “Seriously though, Li,” Rachel leaned on her elbow, studying me curiously. “How are you surviving living next to Tess’s brother? He’s like, a sex maniac.” Sara ripped the loudest snort. “Yeah, Lia, how on Earth do you survive that?” she asked as I ground my teeth. “Wine and meditation, Sara. How about that?” I asked, but when I turned to her, she’d already disappeared into the crowd. What the hell, woman? I cursed her for leaving me, which she never did. Rachel gave a sudden
 gasp. “Omigod, Lia. You know,” she sipped her drink with big, scandalous eyes. “Last weekend… I can’t even say it. You’re totally gonna die.” “What?” “I heard Lukas having the loudest. Sex. Ever.” I choked on my champagne. “You… really?” “Yes. I’m pretty sure he was like, fucking her in the hallway.” My heart pounded. “You could actually hear that?” “Ca-lear-ly,” she said, breaking up the word to convey just how darned clearly she heard it. “You were probably dead asleep but I was straight up wondering if I should march up there and ask if they wanted company!” she cackled, slapping my knee. “I was just back from a date myself so I still looked super cute. Pretty sure he would’ve been happy to have me.” “Possibly,” I said, recalling the threesome I almost witnessed Lukas having the first night that we met. “‘Possibly’? More like definitely,” Rachel scoffed. “You don’t know because you weren’t there but Lukas invited me and my friends over for drinks awhile back and he was literally in heaven surrounded by so many hot chicks. He loved it. I seriously wish you got to see him that night, Lia.” I smiled. Oh, I saw him that night. He rubbed his rock-hard dick against me while kissing me in the hall, and I spent the next few days dreaming about the sex we wound up having later that week. I sucked a breath between my teeth. God, I was so tempted to say it but instead, I ground my teeth and took the high road that Sara so passionately despised, smiling and nodding as Rachel gabbed on and on about Lukas and his friends being “so flirty” that night. “That sounds like fun!” I interrupted when I’d finally had enough. I wanted to keep my prime seats at the bar but I didn’t love them enough to hang out another second with Rachel. “Anyway, I should probably go find Sara…” I said, going on my tippy toes to  scan the crowd for my best friend’s long, black hair. But I saw nothing and when I reached into my bag for my phone, I froze. Shit. “Where’s my phone?” I murmured, digging deeper as Rachel watched me. “Oh,” she sucked loudly at the bottom of her drink. “I thought you knew.” I blinked up at her. “Knew what?” “That Sara took it? Pretty sure I saw her do that like, twenty minutes ago.” I stared, realizing what those nudges were actually for. “Oh… fuck.” I was in frantic denial, still searching my pocket-less outfit for my phone. I was hoping Rachel was wrong because if Sara really had it, I knew exactly what she might want with it and whom she might be trying to text. “Hey, Rachel? Can I borrow your phone really quick?” I asked, still patting myself down and surveying the bar for my soon-to-be former best friend. “No, I’m on twelve percent,” Rachel said barely a second before a sharp gasp ripped from her throat. “Oh. My. God.” I froze, staring at Rachel’s giddy face as I felt the heat on my back. “Lukas!” She launched off her chair as I gripped my barstool, feeling like I might topple over from the weight of my heart slamming against my chest. I still held out hope that it was another Lukas but that hope was dashed once I turned in my chair because there he was and damn it. Goddamnit. He looked beyond good and he knew it as he grinned at me over Rachel’s bouncing head. Hoo-boy. He looked insanely good in a black V-neck and jeans and despite nodding along with Rachel, he kept sneaking sexy little glances at me. With the last look in my direction, he gave me a full-body onceover, arching an eyebrow at the pencil skirt wrapped around my hips before turning back to Rachel with a full grin I knew was for me. It was crazy. I could somehow feel his attention on me despite his eyes on Rachel and just to test it, I played with the stem of my champagne flute. His eyes flicked over instantly and watched my fingers stroke the glass for two seconds before breaking into a dirty laugh that he said “sorry” for to a quizzical Rachel. Yeah… fuck it. I wasn’t even that drunk but I couldn’t resist anymore. Cocking my head at Lukas, I drew his eye. Holding my hand up, I beckoned with one finger. I grinned with satisfaction as he promptly came to me, letting the crowd separate him from Rachel. “That was cruel,” he said at me as he ordered a bourbon. “What was?” “Whatever you were just doing to remind me of your hands on my dick,” he said as he leaned into me to grab his lowball off the bar. I caught the scent of crisp cologne mixed with fresh soap and my toes curled as I imagined him getting out of the shower just thirty minutes ago. “You should know it was Sara who texted you before.” “Yeah? You didn’t want me here?” Lukas brought his glass to his curved lips. All eyes around us were staring at him but his were strictly on me, and it made my cheeks heat up. “I did and I didn’t. But I’m glad you’re here now,” I finally said, peering at Rachel trying to push her way back to us. “Partially because of that one but also because I should thank you for the paella the other night.” “You liked it?” “I loved it. I was practically licking the plate,” I smiled, watching his eyes dip to my tongue as I said the word “lick.” “Wish I could’ve seen that.” I laughed. “It wasn’t as sexy as you’re imagining.” “Well, only I get to decide what I find sexy about you and in case you haven’t noticed yet, it’s most things,” Lukas said, oblivious to the train of Sara’s coworkers who passed by to check him out and give me a big thumbs up. When I narrowed playful eyes and shook my head at them, he laughed. “For example, that.” “What?” “That look. You’re annoyingly sexy when you’re pissed off.” “Oh? Is that why you’re so eager to piss me off all the time?” Lukas tilted his chin up in a challenge. “When was the last time I pissed you off, Lia?” he asked. “Can you name it in two seconds or are you just trying to find reasons to stay mad at me?” “Why would I need to do that?” “Because you want to think you can do another three years of all work and no play, but you also know you feel better than you’ve ever felt in your life since fucking me, Lia,” Lukas said, watching my cheeks go red. “And you just can’t stand for that to be true, can you?” he smirked just as Rachel sidestepped her way back over to us. “Whoa, there, Lia!” Hugging Lukas’s arm to her chest, she wiggled a finger at me. “Look at you trying to get all flirty, girl! You almost look like you know what you’re doing.” “Thank you so much, Rachel. But as much as I love your backhanded compliments, would you mind giving me a second alone with Lukas?” “Well, damn. Since when did you get so bold, Lia?” I took a drink and looked up at Lukas. “When did I get so bold, Lukas?” He read the look on my face. “Probably the night I took you to dinner and did bad things to you in the hall.” My jaw fell as Rachel choked on her drink. Despite her cough attack, Lukas kept his eyes trained on me. “I still have your panties by the way.” Oh my God. Rachel was frozen for what felt like a good five seconds but then with an awkward mutter and a half-complete sentence, she turned on her heel and marched off. Hand clamped over my mouth, I stared at Lukas. “Sorry if I misread that situation,” he said, mischief curling his lips. “Thought you wouldn’t mind me saying all that in front of her.” “That was actually kind of fun for me.” “Kind of?” I smirked. “Fine. Extremely.” “Alright,” Lukas nodded in approval. “And now that we’re on the topic of confessions, why don’t you go ahead and admit one more thing for me.” My breath shortened as he drew closer, his hand on my lap and his lips painfully close to mine. “What’s that?” “That you want to see me again. That I make you feel better than anyone else has made you feel in a very long time.” “Fine. I want to see you again,” I murmured as the bar lights dimmed. “I like the way you make me feel.” “You love the way I make you feel.” “I love it,” I said between my teeth. “Is your pussy wet for me right now?” I glared. “Do I really need to answer that here?” “No. Not with the way you’re squirming,” Lukas smirked, hand on my lap as he slid his empty glass across the bar. I closed my eyes as I caught his scent again. “Jesus. I can feel your thighs twitching, Lia,” he murmured, gazing down at them. “Do you want me to fuck you in this bar?” “No.” “Are you sure about that?” “No.” I looked away, scanning the crowd for anyone watching as Lukas slipped his fingertips just under my skirt. My mouth parted as they inched up further. His skin was warm but it felt ice cold against my burning thighs. I exhaled as he leaned in to kiss my neck, sliding his hand swiftly up my skirt and snapping my thong just as he pressed his lips against me. “Lukas,” I gasped as he swept his tongue over my neck, thrusting his hand between my thighs and sliding his fingers inside me, utterly ruthless as he pumped his wrist for two hot, hard seconds. Holy shit, holy shit. We were at a bar, surrounded by people. And he was inside me. But just as quickly as it happened, Lukas drew back completely, leaving me breathless and panting on my barstool. The void he left between my legs made my nails dig into the bottom of my seat. He grinned as he eyed me. “Tell me how many times you’ve touched yourself in the past four days,” he said, tugging his bottom lip with the fingers he’d just had inside me. My pussy throbbed as I watched him lick his lips. “Every night since the one you fucked me,” I breathed. “How many times did you fuck another girl and think of me?” “None. I jerked off.” “How much?” “A fucking ridiculous amount.” “What did you think about?” I asked, increasingly breathless as Lukas’s eyes blazed into me. “What do you think?” he countered, irritated. “I thought about how big your eyes got when you first looked at my cock. I thought about all the little sounds you made when you sucked on it. Like you’d never tasted anything so good.” Lukas tightened his jaw, his hand on the bar becoming a fist. “Trust me, Lia. It’s been a rough fucking four days.
 All I wanted was to drown myself in you and think about nothing else but instead I had to jerk off to the thought of you while knowing you were right across the hall. Probably in the shower. Maybe asleep.” His green eyes darkened. “I’ll admit I fantasized pretty often about kicking your damned door down and just fucking you over the kitchen counter.” He grinned as he let his gaze drop. “Wouldn’t mind seeing those perfect tits dipped in chocolate.” Holy God. “Lukas, maybe we should get going…” “No. You’re going to wait for a little,” he said with satisfaction as I stared pleadingly. “Trust me, Lia. You can survive the next four minutes if I survived the past four days.” “Lukas, no,” I whimpered as he cupped the back of my neck and kissed under my jaw. I closed my eyes, grateful for his hand under my skirt again. “You can do it,” he chuckled, tickling my thigh. “I can’t… please, just take me somewhere right now.” “Only if you promise me one thing,” he whispered, the crowd swelling around us as he teased my clit over my thong. “No more rules and restrictions. I live across the hall from you. If I want to see you, I’m going to knock on your door. If you want to see me, you’re not going to stop yourself anymore.” He pressed down on my clit. “Is that a deal?” My head spun. “Yes. Deal,” I exhaled. “Alright. Then let’s go.”            15      LUKAS   “Please, Lukas…” Fuck, I could listen to that smart mouth beg me all night. My dick was fighting my jeans. It was dying for some action already but I was taking my time with Lia. She just looked so damned good sprawled out for me on a white bed, in just black panties, shamelessly begging to be fucked. Undoing my button and zipper, I glanced over at her clothes strewn in a trail from the door to the bed, littering the floor of the suite. “I want to be loud.” That was her hot little argument for booking a room somewhere instead of going home. I didn’t need to be told twice. I was curious myself to see just how loud she could get. There was a lot she was holding back and I wanted it out. So we went to a hotel. Once I stepped out of my jeans, I pulled her thong down her legs. “Spread your pussy for me,” I said. She obliged immediately, back arched and tits pushed out as she pushed her fingers against her wet folds. I grinned in disbelief. “Fuck. You’re a dirty little girl, aren’t you?” “No.” “My view begs to differ.” “You do it to me,” she groaned, reaching to touch herself. But she whined when I climbed onto the bed and gathered her hands, tucking them under her back and winding her thong around her wrists. The fact that she barely reacted to the restraints had my balls aching. She didn’t care that she was tied up. Complete naked. All she could think of was one thing and that turned me on to no end. “Please fuck me,” Lia whispered, her breasts bouncing lightly as she writhed on the bed. “I can’t wait anymore. I can’t, Lukas, I swear…” “Patience.” In one stroke, I rolled the condom on and nudged the head of my dick against her seam. She gasped and spread her legs wider for me, displaying herself to me, begging me with every part of her body. Christ, it was hot. I meant to tease her, to make her wait a little longer. But she was whimpering and moaning on the bed. She was so unabashedly needy, I had to give in. “Yes!” she cried as I plunged inside her. “Fuck. So good, baby,” I groaned against her neck. She was so perfectly wet, so perfectly tight and warm. I slid my hands under her ass, lifting it off the bed and giving myself room to push deeper into her pussy. “Jesus Christ… you feel unbelievable, Lia. Fucking unreal.” Her walls clenched around me but she was so fucking wet my cock slid in and out with ease. Catching her mouth with mine, I kissed her the way I’d been waiting to for what felt like ages. I refused to waste an inch of her, sinking deep in her pussy, filling my hands with her body, tasting her tongue and sucking her lips. “Keep doing that,” I murmured as she moved her hips to meet my every push. It was a fucking sauna as the sounds of her thrusts and moans filled the room. I buried my face in her neck as I rocked inside her, rewarding myself with her incredible body. Feeling her tits bounce under me, I drew back, still inside her as I went on my knees to take in the full view. “God, you’re beautiful.” I spread her knees wide, soaking in the view of my cock sliding in and out of her, tip to base, over and over. “Lukas! Don’t stop,” Lia begged in a panic when I pulled out, drawing back further to climb off the bed. But she exhaled with relief when I pulled her to the edge, grinning at the sight of her hands still bound behind her back, her legs wide open and her pussy so wet it made the skin on her thighs glisten. “You’re going to feel me deeper inside you this time,” I said, staring down at her. “Are you ready?” “Yes,” she breathed urgently. “Just do it, please.” Pushing her knees up, I sunk myself back inside her, soaking in her long, ragged moan and the sight of her tits bouncing with my every push inside her. It was fucking mesmerizing. “So perfect.” I gazed down at her, gripping tighter on her legs. “You don’t know what you do to me, Lia,” I growled. “No. Fucking. Clue.” I punctuated every word with a thrust deeper than the last. “Go on, baby,” I grinned as her moans grew louder. “Say my name.” Every time she cried it out, I fucked her harder. “Again.” “Lukas! I’m coming!” Surprise spread my lips as her hands broke free to grip my thighs and claw the sheets. “Fuck, baby.” My balls churned as I watched her squeeze her own tits, and my abs burned as I grinded ferociously inside her. “Fuck.” I gnashed my teeth as she tightened mercilessly around my swollen cock. “Do it. Let me feel that pussy come all over me.” “Lukas!” “Yes,” I groaned. “Come, baby.” With one last slam of the hips, she fell apart underneath me. My head rolled back as I felt all of it. The pleasure that surged her body rippled over my cock and with a deep, guttural sound, I flexed, pumping my hot release inside her. Holy fuck. My head was light as I collapsed on top of her, grinning through my breathlessness as she wrapped her eager arms around me, kissing me back with such sweet desperation I could taste it. I could taste her awe and gratification and I was instantly addicted. I wanted to show her everything I could do to her body. Everything I could make her feel. Catching my breath on my back, I watched Lia roll onto her stomach, still panting as she smiled shyly at me. She was so gorgeous with her cheeks glowing and her hair in her eyes that all it took was her climbing onto my chest for me to stop breathing. I didn’t say a word as I watched her nestle into my body and relax, taking only a couple minutes to doze off into a dream. The smile that drifted onto my lips stayed there as I reached over my head and grabbed a pillow, stuffing it under my neck so I could stay still for her as she slept. I was tired myself but I forced my eyes awake. I didn’t want to miss a second of this.            16      LIA   I’d woken up a few minutes ago and I was still surprisingly relaxed despite the several things I should technically worry about. For starters, it was 10AM and I was alone. Lukas was nowhere in sight and judging from the feel of the bed, he’d been gone for awhile. On top of that, I couldn’t see my clothes anywhere and I didn’t even have my phone to call anyone. But I did have to laugh at myself for leaving The Margot in such a rush last night that I didn’t even bother finding Sara to get my phone back. It didn’t even cross my mind because of whatever Lukas had done to me at the bar. I couldn’t remember when or how it started but with just a few words, he had me drunk off lust. The haze he put me in clearly lasted throughout the night because as I sat up, I realized I was noticing the hotel room for the first time, despite spending my night there. It had been just a rush of skin, heat and need last night. I hadn’t even taken the time to look around and appreciate that this was easily the nicest hotel room I’d ever stayed at. Sunlight drenched the suite, bouncing off every shiny glass surface and bringing out the champagne hues of all the furniture. The bed itself was twice the size of mine at home and the only reason I felt compelled to get out was to check out the bathroom. “Whoa,” I murmured, feeling delightfully girlish as my eyes fluttered about the shimmery white marble and cream tile. Next to the basin sink was a tall, white orchid I couldn’t imagine was real. Just as I leaned over to finger the petal, I heard the front door open. I spun around to find Lukas already watching me in the doorframe, a crooked smile drifting onto his lips as his stare slid up my naked body. He took his time admiring me as he removed his ear buds, winding the wire into a neat circle before tucking it into the pocket of his black sweats. “Hi,” I said softly, recognizing that he’d just come back from a workout. The T-shirt he peeled off his torso was soaked in sweat and his hair was damp, tousled in a way that curved the edges of my lips. “What?” he asked with amusement. I shook my head. “Nothing. Just looking at you.” “Same,” he said, breathing deep as he eyed me. “God, I want to put my hands all over you right now but I was just running and I don’t want to get you all dirty.” “You got me pretty dirty last night, so by all means,” I smirked, giggling when my words compelled him to drop his bag immediately and come straight to me. I moaned into his mouth as he kissed me, cupping my ribs and stroking his thumbs over my nipples till they hardened. I closed my eyes and breathed in his natural scent, getting hot the second he pressed my naked chest against his. I normally hated sweat – mine or anyone else’s – but Lukas’s set off something carnal in my body and before I knew it, he was palming my pussy. He let two fingers
 tease my wet folds as he kissed me back out into the bedroom. But instead of laying me on the bed, he surprised me by spinning my body and pushing my naked breasts up against cold glass. “Lukas!” I gasped, opening my eyes to stare out the enormous window and over the Hudson River. My palms were flat against the glass as he shoved his sweats halfway down his thighs, already breathing hard. I heard the crinkle of a condom as his erection grazed my back and in seconds, his cock was rubbing against me. “Lukas, people will see…” “Let them see how beautiful you are,” he murmured, groaning as I arched my back to sink my pussy down on his cock. “Holy shit.” He sucked in a sharp breath as I slowly swiveled my hips, grinding back against him, gradual with my pace till he was all the way inside me. “Fuck. Look at you, baby.” A dirty grin spread my lips. Because the harder I rode him, the harder I pressed my tits to the window and as terrified as I was that someone might see, I couldn’t stop myself. It was a flood of sensation with the cold glass on my nipples and his steel cock pummeling inside me. It felt wild and wrong and completely out of control. But it also felt so. Outrageously. Good. “You like that, don’t you?” Lukas demanded. A burst of heat shot to my core when he pulled a fistful of my hair. “You like showing those perfect tits off, don’t you?” I didn’t want to answer because it was fucked up that I did. This was dirty. Pure filth. But I’d never felt sexier in my life. “You turned me into this,” I panted, grinning because I knew what my sass did to him. With a low growl, Lukas palmed the underside of my ass. He caressed it gently for a teasing second – then he gave it a spank that echoed the room. A sharp gasp escaped my throat. “I brought it out of you,” he corrected. My skin stung but before it could fully recover, he spanked me hard again. “But trust me, it’s been there,” he murmured, cursing under his breath as he felt my body’s reaction to his harsh blows. “Christ,” he whispered. “You’re dripping, baby. Do you hear it?” His lips curved against my skin when I slowed down to listen, giving a little gasp at the sound of my pussy sliding over his dick. It was obscene. Like wet lips smacking. The sexiest laugh rumbled deep from his chest as I moved back and forth on his shaft slowly, the sounds of our sex getting me wetter, him harder, like a vicious cycle that ended in him growling as he slammed my hips down on his cock. “Lukas!” The pain and pleasure tore so hard through my body that it took a second for me to realize he’d moved us. He had me on his lap now as he leaned back in a chair, breathing hard between clenched teeth while watching me ride him. I could see his heavy-lidded stare on my ass as I watched us in the mirror. I wet my swollen lips as I watched myself. “That’s right, baby. Look at you,” Lukas murmured. “Look at how fucking sexy you are. Look how you fucking spoil me with those beautiful tits.” He groaned. “This fucking ass. This tight pussy… Christ, you’re going to make me come so fucking hard, Lia.” As if trying to beat him to the punch, my core convulsed. As I came, the gravelly filth he murmured launched me even further off the edge. There were stars in my eyes as I felt him pull me back against his chest, his body stiffening under me, and his hands kneading my breasts hard as his orgasm hit. Sitting on top of him, I rode his powerful climax like a roller coaster, relishing in every lurch and spasm of his muscles. I was amazed that I could do that to him. He was well over six feet of pure muscle but it was my body that brought him damned near to his knees. I loved the feeling. I already wanted more of it. “Just… wow.” The words seeped from my lips as I rolled my head back on his shoulder, shaking my head for the fantasies I had even after climaxing. “What?” Lukas smirked as he eased me onto my feet. I bit down on the tip of my finger. “I’ve never seen someone physically embody a dirty thought as hard as you are right now,” he laughed. “Tell me what you’re thinking about.” “Nothing. Just wondering what it feels like without… a condom.” His eyebrow shot up but he took several seconds to speak. “Are you trying to kill me right now? Jesus. I can only get so hard.” I giggled. “I’m sorry, I just… never have. And you’ve been a lot of my firsts thus far so naturally, I had that thought. But let’s go ahead and move past it,” I said with a hint of sass that had him stalking me across the room. “Seriously though, do you ever take a break from turning me on?” he grumbled, pushing me onto the bed and kissing me for a couple minutes. I let myself melt into the foamy mattress, enjoying the comfort of his weight on top of me and his smooth lips crushed over mine. I reveled in all of it. The hotel, the sheets – just being with a man as gorgeous as him. Whatever I was feeling in that moment, it was addicting and dangerous, and I recognized that thoroughly. I forced myself to feel guilty as I kissed him. And still, I couldn’t stop myself. “What’s that face?” I asked when he finally pulled away to look me in the eye. “Nothing. Just if you mean what you just said, there are things we can do to make it happen. But it’s your decision. I’m happy to have you however you’ll let me, so it’s your decision. In the meantime – ” He paused for effect. “We should probably get some breakfast.” “Yes. I’m a hundred percent with you on that.” While I washed my face in the bathroom, Lukas ordered off the room service menu. And while we waited for it to come, he presented the amazing surprise of what he had in his black gym bag – fresh T-shirts from his apartment as well as my phone, which Sara had apparently texted him to retrieve early this morning. After getting over the adorable fact that Lukas had gone to fetch my phone for me while I slept, I climbed back into bed, snuggled in his softest V-neck as I shot Sara a quick hello. Unsurprisingly, she texted back within seconds.   SARA: So he’s a keeper. ME: Good morning to you too. Also, what?? SARA: I texted him from your phone at like 7AM. He came right here, introduced himself proper, asked me why I was working on a Saturday, asked a couple questions about you… ME: What’d he ask? SARA: How long you and I have been friends. What you like to eat for breakfast. What you and I are usually up to on the weekends. SARA: And then he saw one of your truffle boxes on my desk and asked to look at it so I let him. He asked if I’ve ever eaten your truffles and when I said yes and they’re the shit, he said, “She’s impressive.” ME: Oh no ME: That’s so cute   Screw cute – it was adorable. Apparently, Lukas Hendricks had the capacity to be adorable. Either that or I was just really into him. Crap, I thought, chewing my grin as I watched him across the room from the bed. He was unpacking the folded clothes from his bag, as if getting ready to settle in for another night. My toes curled against the plush mattress as he leaned over the duffel, giving me a wonderful view of the rippling muscles on his perfectly tapered back. I groaned inwardly. Double crap.   ME: Help me I think I like him SARA: Girl help ME! You’re at a fancy hotel with an absurdly gorgeous man who ran all over the city for you this morning. And I’m at the office on a Saturday. ME: He has cute friends if you’re interested but I know you’re not. SARA: I know. I’m not. I have no time for it. ME: Well I thought I didn’t either. SARA: You THOUGHT you didn’t? SARA: Wait a minute. Does that mean you’re changing your mind about letting yourself like him now? SARA: Neighbors with benefits??? Yes??? SARA: Please. Let me live vicariously through you. SARA: Come on. Just say it. You’re falling for this guyyyyyy oooooh yeahhhhh ME: I can’t be because things don’t happen this fast SARA: When it rains it pours, baby girl. It’s not a saying for no reason   I scrunched my nose, unable to argue Sara’s claims. When it rains, it pours rang bitterly true to me. In my head, it had a negative connotation but now, it was positive. At least I hoped it was. Typing some half-assed response to Sara, I hit send and tossed my phone across the bed, giving up on trying to make sense of anything. Of course the second the thing landed, it rang loudly. Lukas laughed as he watched me ignore the call. “You’re not going to pick up?” “No. It’s just Sara giving me a hard time.” Coming over, Lukas picked up my phone. “The name says Elaine Gardner.” My eyes shot wide open. “Are you joking?” “No. Who is that?” “Omigod – the investor!” I hissed, heart pounding as I threw the sheets off my body and scrambled to Lukas at the edge of the bed. He laughed as I grabbed the phone from his hand, watching me curiously as I frantically answered the call on my knees. “Hello?” “Lia? It’s Elaine Gardner.” “Yes, of course! How are you?” I asked breathily, despite my best efforts to speak with some shred of professionalism. “I’m well. I hope this isn’t a bad time… I just want to call regarding yesterday’s meeting.” My stomach twisted. For some reason, her tone gave me a bad feeling. I wasn’t sure what it was but it must’ve been obvious because I felt Lukas give me a little squeeze. Blinking, I looked down, oblivious to the fact that I’d grabbed his hand out of pure nerves and anxiety. “It’s not a bad time,” I said, preparing a smile, forcing myself to try and be graceful no matter what she decided. “Right, well, I want to let you know that I really appreciated your presentation yesterday. I really did enjoy your product and even more than that, I enjoyed your vision for the brand. You’ve clearly thought about this for a very long time,” she said, breathing in audibly as she took a long pause. “At this time, I have a very similar company I’ve been looking to do business with…” Fuck. My shoulders fell. I heard Lukas murmur my name but I ignored him, hiding my wet eyes from him as I half-listened
 to Elaine talk about some other chocolatier with a similar product as mine. The second I heard “conflict of interest,” I pretty much tuned out. “It’s okay,” Lukas whispered as I nodded along to both him and Elaine, trying my hardest to be an adult about all this. But the wave of disappointment was strong and despite surviving that first big hit, I was still reeling. As the rush of adrenaline finally subsided, I heard Elaine’s warm laugh on the other end of the phone. My ears perked up. “I guess what I’m telling you is that I liked your presentation enough to forego my relationship with the other company. I’ve chosen to work with your brand, Lia. And if it’s alright with you, I’d like to meet on Monday to begin paperwork.” My mouth fell wide open. “Oh!” I blurted, bursting into laughter as Lukas cocked his perplexed head at me. I did my best to hold it together for the rest of the call but I was mouthing oh my God on repeat to Lukas and quietly freaking out as he did his best to muffle his big laughs. Oh my God. Oh my God. Finally. I did it. It was happening. Three years ago, I was underemployed, miserable and living with a man who not so secretly wished for me to fail. Now I was living on my own, working on my own and perhaps just months away from opening my own shop in Manhattan. The second I hung up, I burst into tears. “Whoa, whoa. Why are we crying?” Lukas murmured, trying to dig my face out from my hands. “You got it, right? Lia. Look at me.” When I finally looked up at him, laughing and crying at the same time, he broke into an adorably huge grin that made my heart swell even more. “I knew it. You’re fucking unstoppable,” he said, cupping my cheeks and kissing my lips like he’d been waiting the entire call to. I tossed my phone aside as we fell back onto the bed again and this time, as I basked in the bliss of his lips and his body on me, I didn’t force myself to feel guilt. I let myself squeal when he said that he was going to order champagne and I giggled nonstop as he suggested – jokingly, I think – that we go to Spain tonight to celebrate. All rules and restrictions went out the window as we lay in bed, rolled around and fought about who would open the door for room service. For once, in that hotel room with Lukas, I just let myself be.            17      LIA   I wore a peach colored sundress on Monday that matched the satin ribbon on my truffle boxes. It was a borderline cheesy thing to do but I was too happy to care. My weekend had been perfect. Beyond perfect. After getting the good news from Elaine, Lukas popped a bottle of Krug and drank his glass while watching me run around the room calling my friends and family to relay the good news. We stayed the night and when I woke up nervous on Sunday, he booked me a massage at the spa on the hotel’s thirtieth floor. After killing a bottle of champagne at dinner, we went back to the room. The bubbles and the excitement had me dozing off fast but in the middle of the night I woke up hot and breathless from a dream. All it took were my fingertips drifting down the ridges of Lukas’s abs for him to wake up and roll, cup my jaw and roll on top of me. His fingers inside me were enough to make me come. Of course, the actual sex did the trick, too. Twice. I was still glowing from it – so much so that Elaine made a comment about my “dewy skin” during our meeting at a beautiful restaurant on 18th and Broadway. She picked the place because of the ornate floral arrangements and slightly retro feeling that matched much of what I wanted for my own shop. Over the course of two-and-a-half hours, we covered everything about the upcoming project, from décor to location – down to the street. I wanted to open near home, in Gramercy Park. For such a small, aristocratic neighborhood, it was incredibly diverse, full of both old money and young students from the famous art schools in the area. It was my dream spot for opening my first storefront and in order to find the perfect listing, Gail provided me with several business cards from her most trusted realtors. I was all set and completely reenergized. I was so completely over the moon that my smile barely faltered when my phone buzzed with a text from someone unexpected. Ritchie. Stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, I stared down at my phone. The edges of my lips finally twitched back down as I swiped my thumb across the screen to read his first words to me in two years.   RITCHIE: Hey Lia I hope you’re well. Actually I know you are… saw your dad at the store this morning and he was pretty ecstatic for once. Said you got some big investment deal over the weekend? That’s crazy. I’m so fucking happy for you and I mean that. This has been your dream for so long. It kind of pains me that Mom isn’t around to see. RITCHIE: So… aside from congratulating you I wanted to text you to let you know I’m finally selling the house. Thinking of getting out of town like you did. Maybe starting my own business. Long story short I was cleaning when I found a box at the back of Mom’s closet that she labeled for you. It says FOR LIA in her crazy ass handwriting lol. I lifted it and it sounds delicate so I’m not about to ship it. And since there’s still a bunch of other stuff that was yours here, I figured I’d see if you’re interested in coming up here to get it. RITCHIE: That’s all. Sorry for the random text. Hope this is still your number. And I hope you do come by because me and everyone else would be happy to see you and hear about your successes. You deserve all of them. Talk soon I hope.   * * * Thanks to the unexpected message, which prompted a twenty-minute call with Sara, I was late to meet Lukas for drinks – or as he called it, a “date.” His need to make that clear on the phone had put a giant smile on my face, as if I needed any more reason. Of course that smile was finally wavering now, thanks to the shock of Ritchie’s message. We hadn’t spoken in so long. The last words he’d said to me were cruel and bitter. He’d gone as far as to mention that our old friends wished me the worst for what I did to him. He’d said so many terrible things that stuck with me for years and still did. So why the hell was I considering going back to that house? “Miss, please follow me.” The host I’d given my name to grabbed one of the matte white menus and ushered me through the sexy lounge area, to the back and through French doors that led to the garden patio. It was a sprawling area with ivy walls separating each table and the most breathtakingly up-close view of the Empire State Building I’d ever seen. Damn. I was going through a distinct I made it moment as I strode across the roof and followed the host up a short flight of steps to what seemed like some VIP area. “Here you are, miss. Your party’s right here. “Oh. Thank you.” I was surprised when he left me standing there in front of a long table of beautiful people, half of them women – most of those women beaming brightly as they talked to Lukas, who smiled politely despite multiple glances at his watch. When he spotted me, he practically jumped from the table. “Thank God,” he breathed out when he came to me. “I was getting ready to get out of here and find you.” “What’s going on?” I asked. But before he could answer the question, I spotted Emmett coming back from presumably the bar because he had a tray of drinks with him. Trailing at ease behind him was Julian. “Oh! Hey! I thought you stood my boy up so I made it a party,” he said brightly, spilling several shots as he switched his tray to one hand and held out the other. “Heard all about you, Lia. I’m Emmett, by the way. This is my brother, Julian.” Julian and I laughed upon looking at each other. “Yes, of course. Nice to meet you, Julian,” I said as Lukas slipped his arm around my waist. “You know, I never got to thank you for that time you eavesdropped on my very personal conversation and relayed every detail to Lukas. So, thank you.” Julian smirked. “Hey. It sped up the process of – ” He gestured vaguely at us. “Whatever this is. So you’re certainly welcome.” I snorted. Whatever this is. It was a vaguely rude but strangely apt description so I took no offense. Lukas, however, was amusingly wary of my feelings as we approached the table. “For your information, I’m an asshole but Julian puts me to shame on a daily basis,” he said, holding me closer to his side. “Nothing you can’t handle but feel free to ignore anything he ever says.” “Got it,” I giggled as everyone at the table adjusted themselves to face Emmett, who gestured grandly at us. “Everyone, most of you know my brother, Julian. I’ve also got here my brother from another mother, Lukas, and his girl, Lia. Everybody say hi.” I blushed as everyone turned and gave the loudest, cheeriest “hiiii” complete with two-handed waves. But it wasn’t their attention that burned my cheeks – it was the fact that Lukas stiffened when Emmett introduced me as his “girl.” Damn it, Emmett, I cursed him inwardly while smiling outwardly in thanks for the seat he pulled out for me. I eyed Lukas as he sat down but instead of the awkward expression I expected, he was already grinning and greeting the suited guy sitting across from him. His name was Bryce and judging from the conversation, he worked with Julian for the Empires’ front office and was someone Lukas sold a home to this year. “Your man’s a horrible person, by the way,” Bryce said to me, grinning at whatever look Lukas flashed him. “He convinced me to buy a place so fucking out of the budget that now, Jess and I have to put off having kids for at least a couple years. And I might have to work part-time as a groundskeeper for the arena.” Everyone burst out laughing as Lukas grinned and shook his head. “Don’t listen to him. He’s lying – that house was barely out of his budget and he doesn’t want kids, anyway.” “Hey. I didn’t when Jess and I first met, asshole.
 But now I’m married, so it’s different,” Bryce said. “What, did she threaten divorce if you didn’t want kids?” Emmett snorted. “Abso-fucking-lutely she did!” Bryce boomed to more laughter. “And I’m pretty much dependent on that woman, so she ain’t going anywhere. Also, I’m soft as fuck now and anything that puts a smile on her face, I’m gonna give it to her.” “Jesus Christ. You’re making me nauseous,” Julian said across the table. “Hey, don’t be mad that you can’t get hard for anything but your job. Hell, even Lukas has found someone – when are you gonna settle down?” I thanked God that the entire table was looking at Julian because I was red from my cheeks to my collarbones over the continued assumption that Lukas and I were in some kind of official relationship. I was so uncomfortable I didn’t even dare look at Lukas anymore. His hand was no longer on my back or anywhere near me, and as potentially irrational as it was, I interpreted that as his need to put a distance between us – just in case I was getting too excited about his friends giving me the girlfriend treatment. I felt my stomach twist with nerves when Bryce turned back to us. I knew his type – not malicious, just a ball-buster. He was probably a genuine friend, just bad at figuring out when he’d crossed the line. “So, speaking of kids, Lukie-boy, have you changed your stance yet?” he asked, catching what I assumed was a glare from Julian because suddenly he was defending himself to him. “What’s that face for? It’s an honest question.” “What, no kids for you?” I murmured to Lukas, daring to peer up at him. His eyes were on the menu but I knew he wasn’t reading anything as he responded. “No.” “Damn, you didn’t know?” Bryce cringed. “That’s like, his number one rule.” “Bryce,” Julian warned. “What? It’s fine. We all have our rules. Like this guy here,” Bryce nodded at Julian. “His is don’t fuck with my work. Even Emmett has one – don’t make me choose between you or my dog,” Bryce said to more laughter. “And with Lukas, it’s don’t even ask me about having kids. Never gonna happen. That was my rule at one point too, though. But things change once you find out that’s a deal breaker for some people.” Bryce turned to me. “That a deal breaker for you?” I had never thought about it till this moment – this moment during which a dozen people, most of them strangers, were looking to me with polite curiosity, waiting on the answer that I now realized was a resounding yes. Of course, the right move was probably to lie about that, just to save everyone from a potentially awkward moment. Is it a deal breaker? My first thought is to say yes, but like you said yourself, Bryce, things change. I may feel that way now, but depending on the circumstances and the partner I’m with, how should I know how I might feel down the line? It was a perfectly diplomatic answer. At the same time, it was probably presumptuous to lie for the sake of Lukas’s feelings – in all likelihood, he didn’t care if this was a deal breaker for me. Because I wasn’t his girlfriend and this wasn’t a relationship. Just hearing his friend call me his girl made him turn into stone, so why did I need to deny a truth I knew well about myself when it wouldn’t affect him at all? “I think since the day I understood what a mom was, I wanted to be one,” I finally said to instant nods from several other women at the table. It was my first time saying the words but I knew in my heart there were none truer. I smiled faintly to myself. “I probably missed out on several rites of passage in my childhood and adolescence but a mother figure was never one of them. I was lucky enough to have two and they were both amazing in their own ways. They both made me pray that someday, I could enrich someone’s life the way they did mine, and being even half as good of a role model as they were to me. So yes, I’d say I’ve always understood that I’d eventually have a family of my own. Of all the goals and dreams I’ve ever had, that might actually be the one I want most in the end.” “Yes,” one of the other girls promptly said, relieving me of what probably would’ve been several seconds of awkward silence. “A hundred percent what she said.” Adamantly, she raised her glass. “A toast to mothers.” “To mothers!” everyone said in that same, bright unison we were greeted with. It was nice, positive moment that I wished we could keep and move past but of course, Bryce was still in search of his answer. “Damn, Lukas, you hear that? That’s gotta change your mind, right?” I had no right to care about whatever answer Lukas gave. I reminded myself of that and still, my heart dropped when he spoke. “It’s not happening, Bryce. End of story.” “Still? You of all people should want kids.” “Bryce, stop talking,” Julian said, shooting an icy look that chilled even my spine. And with that, Bryce went quiet but the damage was done. The table was still, silent and several of the girls were sneaking me looks of genuine sympathy, since to them it looked as if my boyfriend had just dropped a bombshell on me. I smiled back to try to put them at ease. “To be fair, we’re just… friends. Really,” I said awkwardly, glancing at Lukas in hopes of catching his look of relief. But he was unreadable. “So… if any of you thought that was Lukas being a total monster just now, please give him at least some credit back,” I joked, breathing easy when I got a few laughs. God, this was hard. Meeting the friends without warning was hard. So was hearing that Lukas was decidedly childfree. I didn’t know that, I didn’t know I’d care but clearly, I did and now I needed to get up and get some air. I was at the end of the line for the bathroom I didn’t actually need to use when Julian ambled by, finally undoing the top button of his white shirt as he leaned against the bar. He stood two feet from me and I wondered if he’d even seen me but then he spoke to me without looking over. “I’m ordering a drink. Champagne for you?” My brow twitched with confusion. “You’re talking to me?” “No. My imaginary friend. He has a drinking problem.” I blinked at him, confused for multiple reasons. “Why would you assume champagne?” I asked, though that was really my least pressing question. “I hear you did champagne with Lukas all weekend. Figured you might want to keep it going.” He glanced at me. “From what I understand, you’re good at keeping streaks alive for years at a time.” The smart remark drew my feet promptly away from the line and to the bar. “Okay. So, what exactly is your purpose here?” “What do you mean?” “I can’t tell if you’re being hostile or if you just carry an unfriendly air with you on a regular basis,” I said bluntly. “So since I can’t read minds yet, care to tell me what’s going on? We both have drinks back at the table. I can only guess that you either have something you want to tell me in private or you’re looking to get really hammered right now.” “It’s the former. I’m not really one for getting drunk, let alone hammered.” “Didn’t think so. So go ahead. What is it you’d like to say right now, Julian?” I asked. I normally wasn’t this bold or up front, but I didn’t think twice about it – I’d been unrecognizable to myself as of late, but the changes I saw were nothing I took issue with. Of course, they took Julian by surprise. He was mostly stoic but I caught that brief twitch in his brow. “I can tell why he likes you.” “Why is that?” “Because you’re an odd mix of cute and innocent and sharp as a whip. In case you’re unaware, that’s every man’s Kryptonite,” he said casually, changing the subject before I could process the compliment. “I should let you know that what my brother said before was no mistake. He does that every time Lukas brings a girl around his friends.” I squinted. “What do you mean?” “He mislabels every one of the flings as the ‘girl’ or the ‘girlfriend’ because he enjoys making Lukas uncomfortable. Every time Emmett does it, Lukas will correct him in front of everyone like an asshole,” Julian said, turning briefly away to order some drinks. “You’d think he could just let the comment thing slide in front of so many people, but he doesn’t. Because that’s been his rule for as long as I’ve known him and even prior to that. No girlfriends.” “I thought his rule was no kids,” I said dryly. “That as well. But that brings me to the fact that that conversation clearly upset you just now.” “And why exactly are you bringing that up with me?” “Because I need to ask you a favor.” I was sure I couldn’t have looked more confused. “What?” “I need you to wait till the end of the month before you run off on Lukas.” Julian faced me fully now. “Obviously, you like each other. He likes you enough to let Emmett call you his girl in front of all these people. You like him enough to be upset by the fact that he doesn’t want kids. So do me a favor and wait before you undoubtedly end things over some freak-out about your career or your time or the fact that he’s distracting you,” Julian said almost mockingly, pissing me off despite the sheer accuracy of his words. “There’s a day coming up soon that’s going to be a hard time for him. It’s the anniversary of what I hope is the worst thing that’ll ever happen in his lifetime, and it’s why Tess is away right now. It’s why I need you to wait till that day passes. You can ghost him all you want after but till the end of the month, I need you to stick around.” I stared in disbelief of what he was both telling and asking me. “Are you not going to provide details about what this day is?” “No.” “Are you serious?” I asked incredulously. “You can’t possibly make that kind of request without giving me some context.” Julian took his Scotch in his hand. “I gave more than enough context for a nice girl like you. You’re not going to be able to hear that and walk away without guilt a this point so yes, I can make that request without saying anything further
 because I just did,” he said, taking a drink from his glass. “Your champagne’s on the bar,” he added before walking back to the table. I was stunned as I watched him go. And angry. And intrigued. What the hell was I feeling right now? I couldn’t pin it. Before this conversation, I was pretty sure I was disappointed in Lukas and upset with myself for caring that he didn’t want kids. But as I excused myself from the table, I’d reminded myself it was good to know that particular deal breaker because there was no endgame with Lukas. I’d gotten understandably carried away this weekend and I needed to get that under control – that was what I was thinking as I stood in line for the bathroom. But now I was ticked off at Julian, curious and vaguely worried about Lukas, and in general, confused. I wanted to find Lukas and find out everything about him, but I was also afraid to face him again. A part of me feared that he’d just reached his limit with me – that Bryce had just reminded him that no quality of sex was worth the burden of a woman seeking a relationship. I could imagine him sitting at that table right now, trying to figure out how to tell me that he suddenly had to go and that we probably shouldn’t see each other after this. For several minutes, I stood at the end of the bar, paralyzed with complete dilemma. But soon enough, I was watching Lukas walk over to me with his head tilted just so. “Why do you keep doing this to me?” he asked with a gentle laugh. Just hearing it made me relax my posture. “Do what?” “Leave me alone with those people.” “Aren’t they your friends?” “Some of them. Some are Emmett’s friends. Some are people I imagine he just met at another bar. He tends to collect people over the course of a night.” I smiled. “Well, they’re not a bad collection of people. Save for… maybe Bryce.” “He’s not all bad. He’s just a professional ball-buster,” Lukas said, helping me off my barstool. “Can I take you somewhere else now?” My eyes fluttered with surprise. “You still want to take me somewhere?” “Why wouldn’t I? If you thought hanging out with Emmett and Julian was going to count as our date, then your perception of me is still as shitty as it was the day we met.” I snorted. “I promise you, it could never get as bad as it was the first night.” “Good,” Lukas said, pressing those smirking lips on the side of my head as he took my hand and led me away from the bar. “Glad to know some things do change.”            18      LUKAS   I was eleven the first time I saw snow. In real life at least – I’d seen plenty in movies. But I had an irrational distaste for fake snow, probably because of the house across the street. During Christmastime every year, they taped piles of cheap cotton balls to their windows to mimic mountains of snow. I thought it looked fucking stupid but Tess was so charmed she used to take pictures, so it was no surprise at all that she bawled the first time she saw actual snow. I was eleven, she was seven and our parents had made a random decision to put us on a plane two days before Christmas, sending us to our uncle’s house in Philly. They’d been fighting worse than usual the week prior, over something neither Tess nor I couldn’t understand, so despite the fact that we were untrusting kids who barely knew this Uncle James, we found ourselves both eager to go. There had to be a thousand good memories from that short vacation but three stuck out most: Tess crying out of joy to see snow, Uncle James predicting I’d wind up at Wharton and me sneaking out Christmas night with his classic wood toboggan. It was probably 1AM when I raced what felt like sixty miles an hour down the street. The wind whipped my hair back and the cold stung the hell out of my cheeks. I knew that none of what I was doing was safe and that it was a bad idea on multiple fronts, but I doubled down anyway, switching positions mid-ride and lying on my stomach to go headfirst down the dark, icy road. I wasn’t sure when I’d get another snow so I was going to make the best of it. For that reason, I didn’t regret the cuts and bruises from getting launched off the sled at the end of the road. It was just how I rolled from an early age – I made smart, logical decisions ninety percent of the time. Then without warning, I did something fucking stupid and reckless. I’d guess that putting someone in the hospital counted as my reckless decision this year but whatever I was doing with Lia this week probably came in at a close second. I’d slept over two nights in a row now. Couldn’t help myself though. She let me so I did. Neither night was planned – it just happened. It was also too damned easy to get out of bed in the morning, get changed for work across the hall and come back in time to see her finally stirring in bed. There was something relaxing about watching her in bed, half-oblivious to me. It was like the storm inside me calmed every time I looked at her rubbing sleep from her eyes. I couldn’t guess what that particular image did to me but it struck some unknown chord inside me that Julian would probably give me hell for. But fuck it. I was prepared for a bad week and if mornings with Lia softened the blow, then I was going to enjoy as many as I could, despite all the reasons telling me to just nip it in the bud. I was well aware of the strain between us, ever since the night with Julian, Emmett and Bryce. I could tell she was hurt by my childfree admission. I knew I had no plans to change my outlook despite that. Basically, we’d spelled out in one night that we weren’t meant for each other. Even if we were in fact looking for a relationship, it was clear now that one would be pointless. Yet here I was, still unable to get enough of her. “Same breakfast we had yesterday?” Lia asked when I joined her in the kitchen. There it was. I grinned, realizing she was oblivious to the fact that with that question, she’d finally slipped up. Despite our proximity in the past few nights, Lia had kept a certain distance. She was noticeably antsy about saying anything too familiar – anything that might sound like something a girlfriend would say. It was cute, especially since she thought she was being slick about it. There was no use of the words “we” or “us" – it was only, “Are you hungry?” or “Should I grab dinner?” There was also her worst offense: “I’m going to go grocery shopping today. I can pick up extra food if you’re interested in me cooking dinner for you tonight.” It was a hilariously robotic interlude to our otherwise intimate routine. We’d had more sex in the past three days than I had in the months before I met her. I showered with her the past two mornings. I soaped her up from head to toe and obviously spent extra time on her tits. At night, she sat on my lap while we watched TV and I spread her legs so I could finger-fuck her at my leisure. And when we went to bed, she laid on my chest. Last night, when she woke up out of nowhere, I asked her what was wrong and she whispered to me her adorably stupid dream. Something about getting an angry letter and an entire shipment of truffles back from an unhappy customer. She let me kiss her for several minutes before we drifted back to sleep. To be clear, I was generally never eager to use the words “intimate” or “routine” to describe anything in my life but there was no denying what the past few days were. Yet there was no mention of “we” till this morning. Just to be a dick, I made sure to repeat it back to her. “Yes. Same as we had yesterday,” I smirked as I sat at the counter in just my sweats, reveling in how she paused and blushed before going to work on breakfast. It was a quarter to nine by the time we finished eating and I probably should’ve been thinking more seriously about getting to work. But then she started making chocolate and suddenly, there was another thing I hadn’t seen her do yet. Apparently, my mind was collecting images of her like baseball cards. There were several I had more than one of, many I fantasized about and apparently a good handful that I didn’t even know I wanted till I saw it. So I stayed another hour watching her do things I didn’t really understand. Something about tempering chocolate. Some other thing about cooling it. I didn’t care what the terminology was – I just enjoyed watching Lia drift away to a happy place I wish I had. It was like I wasn’t even there as she leaned over to carefully paint each round mold with a small brush and what looked like paint. Occasionally, as she drew small, identical strokes over the rows upon rows of tiny canvases, I heard her give a little hum of contentment. And though her top was starting to slip irresistibly off her shoulder, I closed my eyes for a second. I wanted to feel what she was feeling. Even if it was a borrowed feeling, I wouldn’t mind at least a taste of it. “What are you doing?” Lia giggled. “Meditating?” I opened my eyes. “No.” “You should try it. You look stressed out.” “There’s no way I could look stressed out right now. I’m watching your clothes fall off your body while you make chocolate. This might actually be the best thing I’ve ever laid eyes on.” She giggled as she poured an abundance of chocolate over her mold. Flipping it over, she held it in the air, letting the excess drip down like threads onto a pan. “I have no doubt you’re pretty pleased in this particular moment,” she smirked, “especially since I don’t have the hands to fix my top.” “Just the way I like it.” “Mm-hmm.” Her voice was rich, velvety. It put me in a trance. “But that doesn’t mean there isn’t something bothering you right now. Underneath everything.” She peered up to catch the furrow in my brow. “Don’t worry. I’m not asking you to tell me. I’m just giving a light suggestion that you meditate before work.” “You’re kidding. Do you actually do that shit?” “Not the way you’re imagining it,” she said, sliding the painted shell of
 the truffles into her freezer. “My form of meditation is something I do every night. Not the past few nights but I usually do when I don’t have guests, which of course is most of the time,” she laughed softly to herself. “Alright, enough mystery. What is this secret practice of yours that you want me to do?” “Take a bath.” I paused. “You’re serious?” Her eyes were bright as she nodded. “And you have to do it right. With salts and oils and all that good stuff. Otherwise you’re just sitting in water.” I smiled. “Is that what you were doing the night I met you?” “Yes.” “Goddammit.” I groaned when I thought again about that night. As if feeling summoned, my dick hardened. I had to be grinning from ear to ear as Lia came right to me, straddling me and grinding so gently on my cock that if someone looked through the window they wouldn’t think she was moving. But she was because I could feel it – every pump of her thighs, every throb of her pussy through the cotton of her panties. Grabbing two handfuls of her ass, I kissed down her shoulder till her top fell off one breast. My laugh was low and languid as she let out a sound that was part-moan, part-whimper. “Don’t turn me on right now, Lukas, I’m trying to help you.” “You can help me by pulling your panties aside so I can touch that pussy.” “You’re the worst,” she breathed out with a giggle. “Lukas,” she protested as I slipped my hand under her, drawing my fingers over her saturated panties. “What do you know.” “Don’t act so surprised, Lukas. You can always assume that I’m dripping wet around you.” “Keep talking like that, you’re going to get fucked.” “Shut up.” She giggled, tipping her head back to let me kiss her neck. I smirked as she tried to get away from me, stretching her arm across the counter, reaching for something. I peered over just in time to see her drag her fingertips across the pan of excess chocolate. The sexiest little grin touched her lips as she brought her hand back, letting it drip across the counter along the way. Before I could ask what she was doing, she surprised the pleasant hell on me by cupping her tit with her hand and squeezing hard, smearing chocolate all across her skin. Fuck. Me. That little sound of content hummed from her lips as I grabbed her and held her breast to my mouth, swiping my tongue across her nipple then dragging it all over her, painfully hard as I sucked the sweetness off her skin. Her fists pulsed around her handfuls of my hair, her pussy so hot and wet on top of my throbbing dick as I licked her clean. Damn it, I need a picture of this, I thought as I drew back to admire my handiwork. She still straddled me in her panties and her worn-out top sliding halfway off her body. She still had just one tit exposed for me but now it was gleaming from the wetness of my tongue and her lips were pinker and plumper than I’d ever seen them. Her mouth stayed parted as she gazed back at me, her eyes pinned on me as her hand clawed her shirt till her other breast popped out. I let out a hard breath. “I could look at you all day,” I muttered as I rolled her nipple between my fingers. “I know you’re ready to be fucked right now, Lia. But I want you to show me where and how you want it.” She smiled. Wordlessly, she got up off my lap, glancing only once over her shoulder as she walked across the living room, shimmying out of her panties along the way. Good fucking God. I whipped my dick out of my sweats, stroking slowly as I watched her push her top off her body, ass naked as she bent over the dining table pushed up against the edge of her window. Without looking back at me, she bent over, arching her body as she gripped the edge of the table and presented me a view of her smooth back, her pinched waist flaring out into that perfect, round ass. I watched the muscles in her calves twitch as she went up on her toes, finally turning to look at me with a wicked little smile. “I want you to fuck me here. Without a condom.” My abs clenched. Fuck, I could’ve come just from hearing that – even when I’d half-expected it. We had quietly taken care of those measures all week but hearing the words out of Lia’s mouth was miles hotter than just knowing something. Then again she could get naked and read me the fucking dictionary and I’d probably come by the third page. Walking toward her, I shook my head. “Had I met you for the first time on the street, I would’ve never guessed you liked it hard.” “I didn’t know what I liked till I met you.” Well, damn. Not your typical compliment but easily the best I’d ever gotten. Positioning myself behind Lia, I ran my palm from the small of her back to the dip of her spine, every muscle on my body tightening as I rubbed the naked head of my dick against the length of her hot pussy. The shudder of anticipation that ripped through me was almost painful. I couldn’t wait a second longer. “Lukas!” Her knees buckled the second I drove my cock inside her. “Baby,” I groaned, my eyes rolling back as I felt the pure heaven of her pussy wrapped around me, squeezing my thick shaft, challenging me to push through her tightness and fuck her as hard as she wanted. A low growl rose from my chest as I pushed myself as far as I could go, my balls pressed against her ass and her nails clawing the table as she gave me a ragged moan. My name on her lips. It had to be my favorite sound on Earth these days. “That feels so good, don’t stop,” Lia whispered fast, her words shaking with my every thrust inside her. I buried my dick deep with every stroke, pulling out only to push back in harder, faster, encouraged by her little whispers of “yes” getting progressively louder. She wasn’t shy anymore – not by a long shot, and I fucking loved it. When I filled my hands with her tits, she clamped her hands over mine and had me squeeze harder. When I talked dirty to her, she talked right back. “Don’t you dare slow down, Lukas. I want to feel every inch of your cock inside me. I need it,” she whispered as I took a moment to tease her. When I picked my pace back up, she rewarded me with the sexiest mmm. Her ass bounced with every backward slam against me and when I muttered what a beautiful sight it was, she turned to watch, grinning to herself at the sight of her own gorgeous body. Just watching her had my balls tightening. “Don’t fucking do that, you’re going to make me come,” I growled, giving her a spank that made her fucking giggle. The sound spiked my arousal and with a grin, I yanked her up to me. “Get over here.” She moaned as I withdrew from her pussy, turning her around and lifting her onto the table. She leaned back on her hands as I sat her ass on the edge, lifting her legs and wasting no time before I sunk back inside her. “Yes, baby. Perfect… that’s fucking perfect.” I was in sensory overload as she faced me now, those brown eyes bright under those heavy lids and her mouth hanging open, hot breaths coating my lips. I didn’t want this moment to end. I kept my eyes pinned to Lia’s as I pumped inside her, my forearms under her legs and my fingers digging into her thighs. The features of her face were so perfect, so delicate. They shamelessly twitched and twisted as I fucked her deeper, showing me every emotion, every hint of pleasure I brought out of her. There was no little movement that didn’t fascinate me. She fucking was beautiful. I’d thought it a thousand times already but in this moment, I’d never felt it more. “Lukas,” she exhaled between the soft kisses I pressed to her lips. My forehead against hers, I drank her in. I saw the tiny flecks of gold in her eyes for the first time. I felt her squeezing tight around me and I heard the change in her breath as she drew closer. I could feel, see and hear everything about her and I didn’t want it to stop. So I slowed my stroke and absorbed her blows when she begged for me to go faster. I felt the workout in my abs, my pelvis as I gave short, measured strokes inside her. I wanted to ride this out for as long as I could. But when she came, I couldn’t hold out any longer. Our frenzied hands reached for each other as brutal climax shook us both at once, our bodies slippery, sticky, my breath on her breath and her nails on my skin. With a joint urgency, we cupped each other’s cheeks, foreheads leaning against each other as we milked every last second out of the unbelievable pleasure. Our lids were heavy but our eyes were bright, on fire as we gazed at each other, in awe of each other. Her tongue danced against mine as I lifted and carried her to bed, laying her down. We floated in a blissful haze for the next ten, twenty minutes. It felt like I was in paradise. My own happy place. And just when I thought it couldn’t get better, Lia put her hand on my chest and said three words to melt me to nothing. “Please don’t leave.” I turned to her with a smile. “Don’t you have work to do? I thought no mixing business with pleasure was your one big rule.” “It is and it will always be. Which is why I’m taking the day off today, as long as you take it off with me.” “Oh, I’ll take it all off with you.” “I set you up for that one,” she smirked. “So what’s the verdict? Do you want to play hooky with me today?” Obviously I did but I took my time to answer because she looked so cute laying next to me, her wild hair spilling over her pillow and her eyes sparkling as she waited for my response. I wasn’t sure if she realized her fingers idly tracing pictures on my chest, the same shape over and over. Just as her hopeful expression faltered, I gave my answer. “I’ll play hooky with you,” I grinned, laughing as she gave a little cheer and pulled me on top of her, wrapping her legs around my waist as she kissed me. Kissing her back, I cursed myself. I was doing it again. Diving in headfirst. I didn’t know what we were or what we were doing, and I was sure it was a bad idea. But I didn’t know when I was going to meet another
 Lia. And everything felt too damned good to stop.            19      LIA   I spent the next morning in Lukas’s apartment while he got ready for work. On his couch, I sipped the cappuccino he made me, content to just watch him knot his tie. I liked the rare moments that his eyes weren’t on me. It gave me the freedom to just look at him, to study him in his suit. Naked, the man looked like a damned Viking but in a shirt and tie, he looked like a gentleman. I couldn’t understand how any straight woman or gay man at his office got anything done when he walked around looking like that. Everything about him screamed sex and authority, down to the frown in his brow. I kept catching them – faint pinches between his eyebrows every couple of minutes, as he thought about work or the day ahead. Or something else, but I wouldn’t know. Unless he was thinking about me, I never came close to knowing what was going on in Lukas’s mind. And while it drove me kind of crazy, I convinced myself to let it go. In the back of my head, beyond the fun we were having, I knew we had an expiration date. It wasn’t a fact that overjoyed me or made me in any way happy, actually, but I reminded myself it was for the best. With Lukas, the universe was giving me balance for once. I had both work and play now. With our little whirlwind romance, I was getting a taste of dating again, my bar was being set nice and high, but I wasn’t getting locked into another relationship. I still had time for me. Fun and temporary. That had been the goal for this from the start, so getting invested in whatever was troubling Lukas was probably not in my best interest. I wanted desperately to know more, but I imagined that he didn’t tell just anyone about himself. He reserved those details for people he trusted and cared about. And as real as things felt between us sometimes, I clearly wasn’t one of those people. “So what’s your day look like?” Lukas asked as he made himself an Americano. “It’s a big one,” I smiled, repositioning myself on the couch. Thanks to Elaine, I had a meeting with my first potential distributor at noon. Just thinking about it got me excited. “You gonna tell me or is it against the rules to even brief me on what’s going on with your business?” I narrowed my eyes at the teasing grin Lukas shot over his shoulder. “It’s not against the rules to talk about it, I just get superstitious when nothing’s official yet. I have bad memories of promising Ritchie’s mom a whole lot of stuff and never following through.” “That wasn’t your fault.” “Well, failure doesn’t care about whose fault it was. It’s still going to happen.” Lukas wore a deep frown as he brought his mug to his lips, shooting a playfully disturbed look in my direction. “You’re fucking intense sometimes.” I grinned. “What? Everyone’s got their sore spots,” I said just as my phone buzzed beside me. “Huh. Speak of the devil,” I murmured without thinking as I read Ritchie’s name off my phone. I’d sent one reply to his message, saying that I would think about visiting. And since, it had opened up a floodgate. He hadn’t stopped texting – random memories, thoughts, old pictures. Even an apology. Under normal circumstances, I would’ve dissected his every text with Sara but in the past week with Lukas, I didn’t care to. Flicking my screen on, I glanced at the text before looking up to find Lukas cocking his head at me. “What?” “Sorry. I caught the name on your phone.” “Oh. Yeah. Ritchie?” “Yeah.” Lukas adjusted his cufflinks as he frowned at me. “I thought you said you two hadn’t spoken since the breakup.” “We hadn’t. But he texted me the day after I got my investment deal. To congratulate me.” “Really? That’s a lot more restraint than I’d give him credit for,” Lukas snorted to himself. I paused, wondering if I should tell him the truth – about Ritchie selling the house and wanting me to visit before it was gone. I was tempted to since I was curious as to what he’d even say. But I decided against it. “Yep, that’s all. Just a ‘congrats, proud of you’ type text.” The crease remained in Lukas’s brow. “How did he even find out about it?” “Well, we’re not close but I did have to tell my dad I got an investor,” I said. “Right.” Lukas looked down for a second. “Forgot he’s still up there. Remarried?” “No. He’s… alone,” I said. “You don’t ever miss him?” I frowned. “Of course I do. It’s just complicated to see him. It involves seeing everyone else. We still text on holidays, birthdays, but the fact of the matter is there’s just… way too much unsaid between us. We’d have years’ worth of explaining ourselves to each other before we could even begin to have a real relationship.” I groaned into my hands. “I hate thinking about this,” I whispered to myself. “Why? You feel guilty?” “Of course I do,” I admitted softly. “I mean neither of us were really wrong. He was too heartbroken to care for me so I forced myself to love a surrogate parent. I wish it didn’t turn out that way, but it did.” I chewed my lip, annoyed with myself for revealing so much about myself when I got so little back from Lukas. “Anyway, I’m going to shut up now. I’m just thankful he lives with my uncle and their family.” “His brother?” “Yeah. They’ve always been really close.” Lukas stared and nodded. “Nice,” he said, though he didn’t mean it. His voice was suddenly far away, his green eyes looking vacant. “Hey.” My brows pulled tight as I studied him. “Are you okay?” “Yeah,” he said far too quickly for me to believe. I pursed my lips, watching him look into his coffee for a silent moment before caving. “You’ve never told me about your parents,” I said softly. Lukas glanced up at me. “You’re right, I haven’t.” Foolishly, I waited for him to say something more, maybe continue his sentence. But he gave me nothing. All I got was that brisk reminder of the wall between us. I tried my luck. Rolling my eyes, I got off the couch. “Right,” I said, bringing my cup to the sink. “Anyway, I should probably get started on my day.” Lukas watched me walk across the room. “You’re upset with me,” he said. “No, I’m not,” I lied breezily. Returning to the couch, I slid my feet into my slippers. I wanted to admit that I was at least irked but getting into a fight was what couples did, and we weren’t that, so I put on a smile that convinced us both that things were fine. “I’m just thinking about all the stuff I need to get done today,” I said, straightening his perfectly straight tie. Touching him generally helped me forget whatever was plaguing my mind. Within a few seconds of my hands on his chest and his cupping my cheeks, I was actually fine again. At least I felt that way. “Hey,” Lukas murmured, his thumbs stroking my jaw. I smiled. “Yes?” “If you find yourself needing a break from work, you should swing by my office,” he said to my surprise. “It’s about to be a long week for me. I could use as much of you as I can get.” I swallowed, having known from Julian that it was about to be a rough week for him. I just wished I knew why and I was less than a second from asking but Lukas unknowingly silenced me, leaning in to give me a last kiss before work. He let his hands slide into my hair and the way he gently tugged on my locks told me that he already missed me. That he didn’t want to go. But that was just it. His touch said one thing and his words said another. As much as I told myself I didn’t care, it was starting to eat at me and since I could feel it actually hurting my heart, I knew. I’d officially gotten attached.            20      LUKAS   “You? Here on a Saturday?” I got a belly laugh from Jack, the weekend desk guy at Hoult Tower who Julian nicknamed Creepy Uncle. “You must have another lady friend up there,” Jack winked. “Actually, no,” I said. The last time he’d seen me, it was late and I was coming from a bar. The girl on my arm was already unzipping her dress so it was safe to say Jack made assumptions. Probably the right ones, too. “So, you’re telling me you got real business to do?” Jack asked skeptically. “Seventy-five degrees on a Saturday, all the pretty girls in little skirts by the piers and Lukas Hendricks is working?” “Believe it or not, yes. I played the hooky the other day so I have to make up for it now.” “Well, I hope you did something fun ‘cause it’s not worth it otherwise. Not on a perfect day like this!” “Trust me, it was worth it,” I smirked, heading for the elevators. “Well, she must’ve been a very special lady!” Jack called after me. “Very,” I called back, grinning when I heard his belly laugh again, echoing with my footsteps in the empty marble lobby. Hoult Tower was usually busy every day of the week, Saturdays and Sundays included. But it was oddly empty today. Forty-six floors in the building and it honestly felt like Jack and I were the only souls inside. Though in all likelihood, there was at least one other poor bastard in the building. Riding the elevator up the quiet floors, I sent him a text.   ME: You here?   The response shot back fast.   JULIAN: If by here you mean the office then yes. ME: You’ll be proud to know that I too am working on the weekend JULIAN: I’ll believe it when I see it.    I snorted, slipping my phone back into my pocket as the doors opened onto my floor. The walk toward the glass doors was eerie without the lights on. Thankfully, I kept a few lights on in the office at all times but still, something felt off as I walked toward the doors. Pressing my key card against the lock, I pushed through and immediately heard the sound of scurrying heels. I frowned when I saw who’d just run to reception from the back. “Noelle. What’s going on?” I asked. It wasn’t uncommon for her to work on weekends but today she looked uncharacteristically haphazard, in just a ragged T-shirt, cotton shorts and flip-flops. It was alarming, if only because she was usually so proud about looking and dressing a certain way at the
 office. I’d seen the woman go through entire boxes of Band-Aids just to avoid taking off a pair of painful heels. My concern jumped up a notch as she stood staring at me, tears starting to well in her eyes. “Noelle?” I stepped toward her but before I could ask again what was wrong, I saw another figure appear from the back of the dark office. I went numb the second I recognized Cam. Like a light, the emotion in my eyes flicked off and my stare went blank as he walked in front of Noelle to give me an easy grin. “Working on a Saturday, dude?” he asked incredulously. I ignored him to look at Noelle. “How’d he get you to do this?” I asked. For all the issues between us, I still knew with certainty that Noelle wouldn’t betray me out of bitterness. Not with Cam. Her mouth trembled open and she stuttered the start of several sentences before I held a hand up gently. “It’s okay. Come here,” I said, eyes still on Cam as I held my hand out to get her the hell away from him. The second she touched me, I heard her burst into tears and whisper “sorry” but now that I had her shielded behind me, my attention was a hundred percent on him. “What do you want? There’s nothing for you to take here. You want a computer? Take one. Take two.” “Fuck off, Hendricks,” Cam spat, tugging on the collar of his blue button-down. “I was just here to… look around for something I dropped awhile ago,” he laughed since we both knew he was lying. “But since I have you here now, I should tell you straight up that I’m going to ruin your life if you don’t legally void the contract. I will,” he nodded earnestly. “You seem to forget who gave you your connections in the first place. You forget the fact that my family is royalty in the world of pro sports. I mean it when I say I’m going to bring this company to its fucking knees by the end of the year and while that’s happening, you should know that I’ll be keeping a close eye on you. Anything you do, anything you say. I can smear your reputation fast.” “Can you?” I wasn’t even faking my boredom. “Well, I look forward to seeing you try.” “Hey. We all know you’ve slept with your fair share of women. Had to have been someone barely legal in there,” Cam smirked. “Do your best,” I ground out as I took my phone out to call the cops. “But you won’t put a single dent in this company. It’s been here too long and in case you don’t realize, no one’s trusted you for years. You never did anything on the business end, so why would they? My network outgrew yours a long time ago, Cam, and I know you know that,” I said calmly, putting the phone to my ear. “If you didn’t, you wouldn’t be so fucking insecure as to try and get to me through Tess,” I muttered just as someone picked up. “Hi, I’d like to report a break-in on the thirty-first floor of Hoult Tower. The address is seven twenty-one – ” I cut off to shove Cam away from me. With a handful of his shirt, I held him away from my body as he swiped again at my phone. Were I not so pissed off I’d have laughed in his face. He had nothing on me. In size or smarts. It had been like that from the start but throughout college, Cam didn’t care. After all, I was poor, the son of addicts. He was from money, the eldest child of a notable family. He was used to having so much more than me, to being my savior and looking comfortably down on me. I should have known things would change when I started out-earning him, in regards to both money and respect. He had always been the type to feel easily threatened. Just not by me. “They’re on their way,” I said to Noelle when I hung up the phone. With a shove, I released Cam and stared at him. “You’re free to walk out now if you want. Either that or stay and walk out in handcuffs. You choose.” “I know everyone at every precinct, asshole,” Cam hissed. “They’ll literally drive me to the station, say sorry and let me go.” “Whatever gets you out of my office,” I said with a carefree shrug I knew would piss him off. Like clockwork, he started to lose it. I knew the look he got when he had nothing left in his arsenal – it was a stupid, bug-eyed face. “Go for it, Cam. Let’s hear whatever low blow you’ve got for me now. Talk about Wyatt all you want. I don’t care. Just get it out.” “I don’t give a shit about Wyatt. What can he possibly do for me now?” Cam sneered, snorting when my lip curled. “Honestly, I’d just like to know more about the pretty thing I saw you with at Tessie’s apartment,” he said, breaking into a big grin when he saw me take pause. “Don’t flatter yourself, I wasn’t following you. Just thought I’d drop off a note for when Tess got back and what do you know, you’re walking down the stairs looking awfully fucking cute with some chick. Serious question – since when did you hold hands and all that mushy shit?” Cam asked. “I mean that shit normally makes me sick but she did have a hell of a fucking rack on her.” “Watch it.” “Oh, I was watching it. Every last bounce of those big tits down to the very last step,” Cam taunted, giving a curious frown. “You know, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen that tight body before. That’s little Tessie’s neighbor right? The one who lives on the second – ” Noelle’s yelp pierced my ear as I grabbed Cam by the throat. “I don’t feel like doing this dance again,” I said, watching his stupid face smile despite going blood red in seconds. “You got me once with Tess but you’re not going to get me again. You try again and I’ll kill you this time. How’s that?” “Peachy.” He tried to laugh – his go-to defense mechanism – but his lips struggled to move. “Lukas!” Noelle whispered warningly. I meant to let go but I only locked my grip tighter, going numb again. I felt his Adam’s apple trembling under my palm and his face was getting to a reddish-purple I’d never seen a person before but I didn’t budge till I felt a grip on the back of my suit – one too strong to be Noelle’s. “Enough,” Julian growled, yanking me back till I let go of Cam and watched him fall to a knee. “Are you fucking stupid? I said don’t give him anything to work with. Did I not?” Julian hissed under his breath before releasing me with a shove. “I got this. Take a breather in your office and take Noelle with you.” I forced myself to go. The last time I felt this rage was when I found out about the shit Cam put Tess through and as willing as I was to put Cam in the ER again, I knew I wouldn’t get lucky twice and avoid jail again. So with a hand on Noelle’s back, I guided her into my office. When I sat her down on my couch, she hugged her knees to her chest. “How did he – ” “He has pictures of me,” she muttered before I could finish my question. “I never fucked him or anything. He just has pictures from nights that he came to hang out with me and Tess. Back in Philly. We were eighteen, you were busy with summer classes and he bought us beer. I was young and stupid and drunk and I let him take pictures of me that I don’t want the world to see now. So I let him in the office the past two weekends. But only because I knew he wouldn’t find any dirt on you. You have no dirt to find.” She looked up at me with wet eyes. “On the outside, you’re perfect. All your dirt’s hidden inside you.” I swallowed, hating that I understood what she meant. “I’m sorry he did this to you, Noelle.” “Yeah,” she said softly. “You should be because it’s on you.” I furrowed my brow. “Okay.” “You don’t have to believe me, but it’s true. Look at how many lives you’ve ruined, Lukas.” I looked up at her. “You’re going to do this to me right now?” She ignored me. “Are you ever going to love me the way I love you?” she asked. She gave me several moments to answer but when I didn’t, she shook her head, laughing despite the tears that rolled down her cheeks. “Should’ve known,” she muttered tiredly to herself. “Anyone dumb enough to love or trust you gets burned. Wyatt. Tess. Stupid me for letting you poison my head with the same bullshit hope you gave them. I thought you were going to make my life better but you only made it worse. You fucked them up, you fucked me up and I hope you fuck up that stupid slut you’re with now, too.” She hugged her arms around herself as she got up off the couch. “I’m leaving before the police get here,” she sniffled before turning to face me. “And I quit, so have a nice life. I doubt you will with all the skeletons hanging all over you but you can always keep trying,” she said, leaving just a few minutes before the police arrived.            21      LIA   I was floating on a cloud, practically skipping up the stairs of the townhouse as I returned from checking out a gorgeous commercial kitchen on Ninth Avenue. According to Elaine, she had “definite interest” in distribution from a friend who owned a "fairly large gourmet grocery.” “Whether or not she confirms, I definitely have interest from stores across the five boroughs who would love to carry your product,” she had said on the phone, “so until you find the perfect lease for your store, start looking for commercial kitchen space. Because you’re about to have orders to fill, darlin’. Better get working STAT.” Adrenaline was still surging through me as I got into my apartment. It felt like I was finally starting to gain real traction on this business and I could hardly contain my excitement. I was so over the moon that when my phone rang with a call, I didn’t even look before answering with a bright and chipper, “Hello!” “Lia?” I stopped in the middle of the stairwell. “Dad?” “Yes, hello.” “Oh. Hey!” I said, my lingering brightness effectively masking my surprise. “Um… what’s up?” “The usual, which is not a whole lot,” he said with what I hoped was content. I couldn’t tell. My father always had what Ritchie would call “old man voice.” It was just kind of a scratchy monotone. I liked to think it would be hard for me to read even if I did know him better. “So…” I stared at the wall, hearing him lean back in his usual
 chair, an ugly plaid thing that sat in the corner of his room at Uncle Ted’s house. “What are you doing, Dad?” “Oh, I don’t know. I was just sitting here. I was thinking about you and I don’t usually call when I do because I know you’re busy. But I went ahead today because I had a feeling you’d pick up as happy as you did just now. Because of all the good stuff happening for you lately.” A smile spread across my lips as I sat right down on the steps. “Yeah. I actually just came back from looking at commercial kitchens to rent. So I can make bigger batches.” “To sell more?” he asked with as much excitement as his voice could ever muster. “Yep. I might have a distribution deal with some big grocery store my investor won’t tell me about yet.” “Wow. Very fancy,” Dad said with a small laugh. Then it was silent for several seconds and I let myself get paranoid that I’d said something wrong or done something to offend him. “So, what are you up to?” I asked to break the silence. “You already asked me that. I’m just sitting here,” Dad replied. I couldn’t read his tone. “Well. I guess I was also calling to tell you I might have done something to upset you. I saw Ritchie at the store the day you told me about your investment deal, and I told him about it. I was excited and I didn’t consider that maybe you didn’t want him to know. It’s kind of been weighing on me, so… I’m sorry about that, Lia. I wasn’t thinking.” My heart melted. “Dad. Really?” I covered my face with my hand and gave a little giggle. “You let that bother you for so long? I’m happy you were so proud of me you couldn’t contain it. Not even to my ex who you don’t even like.” His laugh crackled into the phone. “Okay then. I’m glad you’re not angry.” “I’m not.” “Good. I’m glad,” he said again. Normally, the repetition in our conversations depressed me and made me feel like we were two strangers. But not today. Maybe I was just happy but the conversation we were having felt like the best one we’d had in years. “Anyway, Lia, I’ll let you go. I know you’re busy. I hope I can find the energy to make a visit soon and see you.” “Or I can come up to Warren,” I blurted, remembering what Ritchie said about the box his mom left me. “Oh.” Dad sounded stunned. “That would be great. I just thought you said you were afraid of seeing people.” “Yeah, but… things change,” I laughed. “I’m not scared anymore. All I’m scared of these days is paperwork and filling orders.” “That’s not too bad,” Dad offered. “No, it’s not. So maybe I’ll come see you. Maybe even tomorrow. I’ll catch a bus and take advantage of the rest of this weekend since it’ll probably be the last non-swamped weekend I’m gonna have in awhile.” “I think that would be nice! I would love that.” I grinned wide at the genuine enthusiasm I heard in my dad’s voice. After another minute of conversation, we hung up awkwardly as usual, but with laughter in our voices so I considered it very much a win. I was still sitting with a smile on my face when the front door of the townhouse swung open. I sat up straight on the steps, getting ready for some snark in case it was Rachel. But it wasn’t. It was Lukas and I knew the second I laid eyes on him that something was wrong. “Hey,” I frowned, standing up. Light and breezy a second before, my heart felt suddenly heavy as Lukas walked straight into my arms. “Tired,” he muttered. “And?” Standing a step above him, I hugged his head to my chest. “I can tell something’s wrong, Lukas. Can you tell me what?” I asked. He heaved a sigh. “Let’s go upstairs.” We went into his apartment and once the door closed behind us, I asked him again. “Please tell me something, Lukas,” I pleaded gently. “Cam broke into my office today.” My jaw dropped. “Are you serious?” “Yes but it’s fine. No one got hurt,” Lukas said, tipping his head to the side as he loosened his tie. “You look exhausted.” “I am.” He tossed his tie onto the couch. Turning to me, he cupped my elbows. “Listen, if you see a guy around here, six feet, kind of sandy blonde hair and a funny shaped face, that’s Cam,” he said. “If you so much as see him even on this block, you call me.” “Why, is he going to hurt me?” I asked incredulously. “Why would he care about me?” Lukas shook his head. “I don’t know. Because he’ll do anything to get under my skin and he already fucked with Tess so now he’s looking for other options.” My eyes fluttered. “What did he do to Tess?” “I don’t think I can explain all that right now.” “Well, try,” I pressed, surprising myself – and him too, apparently, because he looked up at me confused. “Sorry. I just…” I let go of a sigh. “I don’t think I can keep pretending anymore.” “Pretending what?” “That I’m totally fine with being left in the dark,” I said. “You ask me questions, I answer. I ask you questions, you dodge them. From the start, you’ve made me open up to you. You made me confess every little thing about my life to you but when I try to get to know you beyond the little fantasy bubble we’re in, the wall goes up. And I’m not your girlfriend, I know that, so I shouldn’t care. But I do. I care about you.” Standing in the middle of the living room, I looked at him, feeling like this had to be the point where I should stop talking. I could easily get away with “I care about you” but not the rest of what I had to say. But my lips were itching to blurt it all out and my heart was aching to get it off my chest. “I like you a lot, Lukas.” Shit. There it is. “More than I know what to do with,” I admitted with a laugh that was both bitter and sheepish. “And honestly, I’m disturbed by the fact that I’ve had the most success in my career while seeing you because it proves my last three years wrong. It means I don’t have to be only work or only play – I can have it all if I want to. I could’ve been doing that this whole time but now that I’ve had you, I don’t think I want anyone else and it sucks because you’re clearly not interested beyond a certain point,” I said, losing my breath. “You roped me in, you chased me and you got me basically hooked on you. But you’re keeping me at a distance because while I’m sure you like me, you like me best for one thing, and that’s sex.” “That’s not true,” Lukas said without missing a beat. “No?” I crossed my arms. “Prove it.” His stare challenged mine. “Come away with me tomorrow. I’ll tell you everything you want to know and I won’t fuck you unless you tell me to.” My eyes fluttered in surprise. “You’re going away, too? Where?” “I don’t know yet. I just need to get out.” “Because of the anniversary?” Lukas stared. “How do you know about that?” I dropped my eyes. “Julian.” Lukas took a second to process that. “Fuckin’ prick,” he muttered. I swallowed the knot in my throat. “Are you mad at me?” “No. Why would I be mad at you?” Lukas asked genuinely. I paused and chewed on my lip. “I can think of a reason.” “Yeah? What’s that?” I slipped my hands in the back pocket of my shorts, taking a moment to answer. “I’ve been planning on seeing Ritchie. I lied about what he texted me for. He’s selling the house and he wants me to pick up some stuff.” Lukas shook his head. “Really? Is this his way of asking you to pack and clean up for him? Because I wouldn’t be surprised.” “No, he says there’s a box for me. From Gail. He said I should come get it and I kind of want to,” I said quietly. “He’s going to have a couple of old friends over and trust me, I’m not hoping to be buddies with them anymore, I’m just… so happy these days that I feel like I owe it to myself to try to tie up loose ends up there. There’s nothing I’d love more than to close up that chapter of my life on a positive note,” I said truthfully, trying not to let Lukas’s look of disapproval get to me. “Combined with the fact that I haven’t seen my dad in a long time and… well, basically I’m going. Tomorrow. I can’t do it any other day, I won’t have the time.” Quiet, Lukas folded his arms. “I’ll go with you,” he said, prompting my eyebrows to lift high. “You want to come with me to shitty little Warren, New York?” “Yes. I need to be away from the city, anyway, and I don’t want you to see Ritchie alone. I don’t trust him.” He sounded pissed but I couldn’t help the little smile twitching the corners of my mouth. “You being protective of me?” “I’ve been.” I sucked on my bottom lip. “Are you sure about this?” “Why wouldn’t I be?” “Because it’s a small town full of very curious people and more than likely, Ritchie’s going to have a couple friends at his house. They’re probably going to ask questions about you and that’s going to be before we get to my dad and uncle’s family. They’re going to ask if you’re my boyfriend and a bunch of other stupid, uncomfortable questions that’ll make you want to run for the hills.” Lukas cracked a smile. “I’d love to pretend to be your boyfriend.” “Yeah?” I laughed, somehow delighted and hurt at the same time. I was happy Lukas wanted to come with me. That he didn’t mind meeting my family. But I was quickly realizing that I didn’t share his contentment to just pretend. I wanted to try the real thing. I didn’t want to keep wondering what we were doing and how long my heart could take it. I wanted to hear him call me “baby” outside of sex. It was a complete one-eighty from my original position on the matter but apparently, people could change that fast. Damn it, Lia. A million thoughts and wants swirled through my brain as I stood in the living room, watching Lukas move around the kitchen, undoing his tie, unbuttoning his shirt, reaching for something in the fridge. He was just winding down from a long day and somehow, he was the picture of the home life I never knew and didn’t realize I wanted till now. “Lukas?” my lips blurted before I could stop them. “Yeah?” he turned around. I paused when I saw him set two wine glasses on the table, pouring unevenly and coming over to give me the bigger one. His shirt was
 fully unbuttoned, giving me a preview of that chest, those abs that I couldn’t get enough of. With a little toast, we touched our glasses, eyeing each other as we took the first sip. Then I found myself watching again, transfixed by the sight of Lukas simply setting his drink on the table, sitting down on the couch and rubbing the back of his neck. “Can I give you a massage?” I asked, smiling at the twitch of surprise in his brow. He looked up at me with bright eyes. “I actually can’t think of anything I need more right now than a massage from you.” I smiled at the word “need.” God, I was so easy. And just like that, I forgot the original thought I had on my tongue. Wedging my body between Lukas and the back of the couch, I pressed the heels of my palms up his hard back till I could knead his strong shoulders, his neck. Each low rumble I drew out from his chest was like a little trophy to me. I loved hearing the sound. It was deep, sexy and intimate. I could listen to it all night. Wrapping my legs around his waist, I kept massaging him, grinning and giggling as he rubbed my feet in his lap. God, did he have any idea what he was doing to me? What kind of sweet, intimate, couple-relaxing-at-home fantasies he was putting in my head? I was half-ready to ask him, “Why do you do this? Treat me like a stranger sometimes then play house with me like we’re married? Why?” But I refrained, obviously. I wanted to try a relationship with Lukas but for now, especially for my first trip back home since leaving, I was grateful to at least play make-believe. In fact, I was slowly getting excited. A part of me couldn’t wait to show him off.            22      LUKAS   Lia’s original plan had been to take a three-hour Greyhound. I opted to drive despite the fact that I didn’t own a car. I’d bought an Audi at twenty-five, right when Hendricks-Cameron made it big, but after realizing I never used it, I sold the thing. Now, on the rare occasions that I felt like driving, I rented. Of course, my idea of renting involved no exchange of money. All I did was pop by Julian’s garage on Eleventh Avenue, where he kept a portion of his ridiculous collection of cars and motorcycles. “This is… actually insane,” Lia said as we walked up a row of shiny cars ranging from vintage Fords to Ferraris, Corvettes and Cadillacs. Julian had them all. “Trust me, I agree it’s crazy,” I laughed. “But I also sold him this space, so I’m not going to complain.” Lia’s eyes glittered at me. “What was the commission on that? Can I ask?” When I told her, she choked. “That’s wild. These cars live on better real estate than I ever will in my life,” she murmured, shaking her head. “God, who are your friends, Lukas? What is your life? I hope you’re prepared for the fact that the people you’re about to meet today in Warren are… nothing like this.” “I’m prepared. Just to remind you, I grew up much more like you. Not Julian.” She shot a smart look. “Just to remind me? You can’t remind me of something you never told me about.” “Fair enough.” “You are going to get talkin’ today, right?” I smirked. “Yes. Just let me get the damned car first.” We rode out in a black Range Rover and thankfully traffic wasn’t a complete nightmare. By the time we were riding through the Lincoln Tunnel, Lia was finally done admiring every inch of the car. With a little smile, she turned her attention to me. “This is fun,” she said. I laughed. “Already?” “Yeah. It’s like a road trip. I’ve never taken one before and I’ve always wanted to,” she said, pushing her Ray Bans to the top of her head. I glanced at her and grinned. She looked like summer in a plain white T-shirt tucked into a little tan skirt that flared out. I didn’t know shit about women’s fashion but I was pretty sure Lia was the definition of simple but elegant. “Why don’t you take a road trip then?” I asked her. “Because I never got my driver’s license.” I raised my eyebrows. “Seriously?” “Seriously. I got a learner’s permit but once my mom died, I kind of lost motivation to do anything for awhile,” she said, looking out the window. “And that included getting my license, I guess. I just kind of... existed for a year or so after. I had moments where I was laughing and having genuine fun but for a long time, I wasn’t really there. It was like a part of me died with my mom and I was trying to get to know myself again for awhile after.” Her words twisted something inside me. “I can understand that. I went through something similar.” “With your parents?” “No. They’re both alive,” I said, controlling my urge to add “unfortunately” to the end of that sentence. “Where are they?” “Miami.” “Is that where you’re from?” “You sound surprised.” “I am. But now that I think about it, Tess does always wear a swimsuit under all her clothes during summer.” I laughed. “Yeah, we were total water babies. We’d go swimming pretty much every day. Walk forty-five minutes to Hollywood Beach and then take the bus back because we were too tired to walk. The bus driver started bringing snacks in case he saw us. Plantain chips sometimes, but Dunkaroos mostly. That was the shit.” “Lukas Hendricks eating Dunkaroos. I can hardly imagine it.” I grinned. “Well, imagine it. I loved that shit. Dunkaroos, Gushers, Capri Suns. Whole bunch of stuff I can’t find anymore.” “Well maybe you’re not looking hard enough. I can find you Capri Suns easy.” “Yeah?” I turned to catch the sass on Lia’s face. Only she could make smug look so good. “Well, do it then. We can make a day of it. We’ll drink Capri Sun, have Lunchables for dinner and watch Jumanji and Space Jam.” “And Matilda.” “What’s that?” “You don’t know Matilda? Wow. I feel sorry for you.” I snorted. “Jesus Christ, take it easy. We’ll watch Matilda.” “Good. Though I have a hard time believing Tess never watched Matilda growing up. Every nineties girl was obsessed with both the book and the movie.” “Well, she had the misfortune of having me as a big brother, and I basically dictated all our TV viewing.” “Rude. Didn’t your parents intervene?” “They were never home.” Lia paused. “Oh. Were they… workaholics?” she asked hopefully. “Alcoholics.” She hung her head. “I’m sorry.” “It’s alright. Tess didn’t even know anything was wrong growing up. It was just our normal,” I said as we got onto the I-95. “Tess didn’t know but you knew?” “I was four years older, so yeah. I knew my friends weren’t waiting up till four, five in the morning for their parents to come home. My best friends parents’ slept in beds at night. I woke up to find mine passed out on the couch with their shoes on.” Even from my peripherals, I could see the sadness on Lia’s face as she studied me. “They just went straight from work to bars or something?” “Yep. They both worked at the same country club. My mom was a server and my dad was in the kitchen. Both their shifts started at two-thirty in the afternoon so as far as I knew, they woke up around two, got to work, went out with friends after their shift and kept the party going wherever it went for the night.” “They were always like that? From the beginning?” I nodded but then frowned. “Well, for as long as I can remember, my dad was always red-faced and bleary-eyed and smelling like booze. I was close to my mom for awhile, maybe till kindergarten. But she was too in love with my dad to be left out of his life and his life was all drinking and partying. So it was almost like she picked up the addiction to stay close to him.” “Jesus,” Lia breathed out, frowning into her lap. “That’s horrible.” “It was alright. Tess and I were pretty used to our routine. We liked going straight to the beach from school and seeing our bus driver on the way home.” “‘Our’ bus driver,” Lia teased, making me chuckle. “Yeah. He was our bus driver. We actually got possessive if other people on the bus tried to talk to him. He was ours.” Lia tipped her head back and laughed. “That’s so cute. I like to imagine that he was an old man who looked like Santa.” I squinted as I pictured his face again. “He was too skinny to be Santa but he was definitely old. Referred to himself as grandpa and abuelo and treated us like grandkids with all the presents he showered on us. In that sense, he was definitely our own personal Santa.” “He sounds awesome. I’m glad you had him considering…” I smirked at her trail-off. “Considering my parents were deadbeats?” “Yes.” Lia glanced at me for a second before gazing out the window. “Something tells me you and Tess were the cutest kids ever so I can’t imagine not wanting to watch you grow up. Then again, I’ve never met a baby I didn’t think was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.” “Really?” I teased. “There are some objectively weird-looking babies out there.” “You’re right, there are. And I still love them. My favorites are the babies with big ears they haven’t grown into yet.” “Shit, then you would’ve loved Wyatt,” I grinned, though my voice faltered midsentence. Huh. I stared out at the road, surprised at myself for bringing him up on my own. I rarely said his name aloud anymore. If I did, it was only with Tess, on the rare nights that we found ourselves able to reminisce without falling into a depression. Gripping the wheel, I felt my heartbeat pick up. But it slowed again when Lia took my hand. I looked at her, expecting her to ask for the story behind him but she simply met my eyes and said nothing for several minutes. All she did was stroke my hand softly, eventually turning back out the window, conveying that there was no rush for me to speak. I squeezed her hand to let her know I appreciated it. Staring out into the road, I let her gently rub my palm for another mile or so, soothing me enough so that when I finally spoke again, saying his name didn’t hurt or feel like a shock. “Wyatt was our little surprise. I think I was eleven when my mom got pregnant with him,” I said, remembering the fighting between my parents
 before they sent Tess and me to spend Christmas at Uncle James’ house. It took years for me to realize what they were fighting about. My mom wanted to keep him, my dad didn’t. “Tess and I stayed over our neighbor’s house when my mom went into labor and we were both losing it we were so excited. We were talking about taking the baby to the beach with us, teaching him how to surf and swim. We had all these ideas of who we wanted this kid to be and when we finally met him, we forgot it all because he was pretty fucking great as is. Big ol’ ears, big ol’ smile just for me and Tess when we finally saw him.” I ran my hand over the grin that spread my lips as I thought about the first moment I saw Wyatt. He had not a damned hair on his bald head but he had green eyes like me, Tess and Mom. I was twelve and even then I knew there was something special about him. He never cried. In the mornings, I’d wake up to find him already sitting up in his crib. He didn’t make a peep till he saw me though, and when he did, he smiled, bounced on his fat baby ass and held his arms out to be picked up. Tess and I found it hilarious. We loved waking up early, sneaking up on his crib and then surprising him so he’d squeal with delight. You had to surprise him to get him to make any noise. Otherwise, he was a quietly happy baby. “Did things…  change in your house? Once he was born?” Lia asked. She was hopeful again so I felt sorry that the answer I had for her was nothing but the same. “Things changed but not for the better. My parents were different with each other. Mom resented that she wasn’t getting any help so while they were still drinking, they weren’t going out as much anymore. They weren’t Bonnie and Clyde anymore. Wyatt put a wedge between them, and my mom resented that. I could actually see it sometimes, her eyes just looking dead when she looked at him. He barely cried but if he did, she’d groan and roll her eyes and if my dad caught it, he’d give her some ‘I told you so’ type speech. And then all hell would break loose. So Tess – she was only eight years old but she made it her job to just grab Wyatt and rock him in her arms anytime he made a noise. Just to keep the peace in our house.” “She’s so sweet,” Lia whispered. “I wish I could’ve seen that. Babies holding babies are the cutest.” “Yeah, especially since Tess is like…” “Thumbelina.” “Yeah,” I laughed. “She’s tiny. Even now.” “Have you spoken to her recently? How is she?” “I call her every night. She’s as good as she’s going to be right now. She’s with our Grandma, the French one I told you about.” “Grandma Elodie?” I turned to her with a smile. “You remember.” “Of course I do. You told me about her the day you made me my first French omelet ever. It was delicious. And you made it so fast. I was pretty impressed that morning.” I laughed. “You would’ve been even more impressed watching me make those in middle and high school. I was probably even better then.” “Seriously? Why?” “Well, Grandma Elodie spent a couple years living with us after Wyatt was born. She couldn’t whip our parents into shape but she whipped me and Tess into shape. I was the cook and the dishwasher. Tess was the one who cleaned up around the house and Grandma was the one who fed Wyatt, changed his diapers, all that jazz. She found an apartment to rent nearby and she’d come in every morning at six and she’d leave a couple hours after Tess and I came home from school. She wasn’t the type to baby us,” I laughed. “She missed home and every evening, she went to hang out with the community of French expats she found. Pretty sure she kept a couple boyfriends in Miami.” “Damn. Grandma Elodie sounds like she knows how to have fun.” “She does. She’s a good balance of working hard and playing hard.” “I see. Sounds like I should meet her and get a couple pointers,” Lia joked. “Hey, if you want to go to France, we can. We’ll say hi to Grandma and Tess and then hop the high speed train to Barcelona,” I said, peering to my side to change lanes. When I went several seconds without hearing anything from Lia, I turned to find her staring at me with a goofy smile on her lips. “What?” I laughed. She shook her head. “Nothing. Go on with your story.” “Let’s stop for a bite first,” I suggested when I spotted a sign for a diner ahead. “I’m hungry again and I haven’t seen you eat all morning, so you must be starving. “I didn’t notice till now but you’re right,” Lia smiled, giving the back of my hand a little kiss before letting it rest in her lap. When I looked over at her, she was gazing out at the window, oblivious to the smile she just put on my face. It was funny to me. The smallest things she did could turn my mood entirely around and she had no idea. It was just a passing moment to her but to me, it brought me another step closer to that unfamiliar feeling of complete warmth and comfort. I’d never felt it with a woman before, but I had a feeling I knew what it was. Of course I wasn’t ready to admit that I might be falling. So returning my eyes to the road, I chose to keep it to myself.            23      LIA   The diner we stopped at was old but charming with its red booths and vintage Coca Cola signs. I was charmed even before meeting the world’s most delightfully stereotypical diner waitress. The nametag on her turquoise uniform read “Dot,” she looked in her sixties or so and she wore thick glasses that she had moved up and down her face while checking out Lukas. “You hold onto that one, doll – and be sure to use both hands, ‘cause he’s big!” she’d said before leading us to our booth in the back. When I took a seat, I was pleasantly surprised when Lukas slid in next to me instead of across. My heart skipped another beat when he casually took my legs and laid them over his lap before scanning the menu. Spotting us from behind the counter, Dot looked at me, smiled and patted her heart. I wasn’t exactly sure what she was saying, but I felt the same way. After ordering, I watched as Lukas took a minute to call and check in on Tess. When she didn’t pick up, he left a voicemail. “Hey. Just wanted to see how you were doing and what you’re up to. Grandma sent me a picture of you guys at the beach yesterday. Looked like you guys had a good time. Call me back whenever. If I don’t pick up, it’s because I’m with Lia, but leave a message and let me know how your day was. I’ll talk to you later.” My eyebrows stayed raised even after he hung up. “Tess knows we’re – ” I paused for half a second. “Hanging out?” “Yes. She wasn’t pleased with me at first, but now that she knows that you’re not a one-night stand, she’s relaxed a little.” I smiled. “Do you know when she’s coming back? I miss her, actually.” “Me too. But I’m not sure when she’s coming back. She usually stays away for at least a week after.” I nodded slowly, realizing he meant a week after the anniversary. I was quiet for a moment before I dared to ask, “Is it today?” Lukas gazed down at my legs in his lap. “Yeah. His birthday.” I couldn’t hold in my confusion anymore. “What happened?” I asked softly, studying Lukas. He kept his eyes down at his hands on my knees and for once, I felt a vulnerability coming off of him. He looked as strong as he ever did with a white T-shirt pulled tight over his broad shoulders, the sleeves stretched around his biceps. But his eyes had drifted elsewhere and there was a different kind of frown in his brow. I could see him trying to figure out how to start, his lips parted but saying nothing. “I originally thought I was going to go to college in Miami,” he finally said. “I didn’t trust my parents to raise Wyatt properly. If they weren’t fighting each other, they were fighting him. My dad loved to tell him he was an accident. That he never wanted another kid and definitely not a – ” His lip curled as he swallowed. “Definitely not a ‘sissy’ for a son. He’d get called to school about the bullies harassing Wyatt and he wouldn’t go. He’d never meet the teachers or other parents. He was pissed that he was sixty years old and dealing with this and every day, he took it out on Wyatt. And Wyatt would just take it because he was the quietest kid. If he was happy, he was quiet. If he was angry, sad or upset, he’d be quiet. It was like he was always being careful not to bother anybody. He was like that even as a baby and a toddler. He was always looking around quietly, just studying everyone and making sure no one was angry.” “Jesus. Poor thing,” I whispered as I pictured him. I could only imagine that being so fearful of others’ feelings was a result of growing up on eggshells and it broke my heart in two. “I’m glad he at least had you and Tess.” “He did, but I had to go away to college at some point. I thought I’d stay near to take care of him and Tess, but when I got into Wharton, everything changed. I’d dreamt of going there since I was eleven. It was my reach school, but I got accepted and I was so fucking happy. But I also felt like a piece of shit because that meant I had to move far way. And even though she’d say she couldn’t wait and she’d visit me all the time, I knew Tess cried about it every night.” “She didn’t want you to go?” “She did. She knew it would give me opportunities I wouldn’t get anywhere else, but she was afraid of taking care of Wyatt alone. He was six, she was only fourteen and our parents were getting worse by the day, it felt like. They refused to take Wyatt to the doctor when he was hurt. They refused to buy him new clothes.” I buried my face in my hand. “God. You didn’t have relatives nearby to help?” “None. But when our parents fought particularly hard, we’d bring Wyatt to Noelle’s house next door.” “Noelle. The girl who was at your door when I first met you.” I raised my eyebrows. “And the one who works for you.” “Worked for me, but yes. She grew up with us. When I went away to college, her mom was nice enough to let Tess
 and Wyatt hang out to avoid my parents but there were times she couldn’t because she had a life of her own, of course. She was divorced and she brought a lot of different men back to her house and the second I heard that one of them hit on Tess, I told her not to go there anymore.” I shuddered. “You were at Wharton by that time?” “Yeah. I’d met Cam and Emmett already. We lived in the same townhouse near campus, but I wound up moving out when I was twenty because I sued for custody of Tess and Wyatt. And since my parents didn’t put up a fight, I won.” My hand flew to my mouth, which hung wide open. “When you were twenty? Twenty years old?” “Yes.” I blinked several times to process it. “God. When I was twenty I was a part-time college student.” “And you were taking care of your ex’s mom.” “True. But you were taking care of two people and you were in school… full-time?” “Yes. Full-time. Thankfully, I worked nights as a bartender and got some help from the government, so we were able to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Philly.” “Two bedrooms? So you slept…” “On the couch. Passed out hard every night so it was no problem for me.” “Wow.” I was floored. I hadn’t imagined any of this – not that anyone really could imagine a story like Lukas’s. “So if you were twenty, Tess was sixteen. And Wyatt was…” “Eight.” I exhaled, my heart breaking yet again as I thought about twenty-year-old Lukas raising a high school junior and a second grader, going to school probably six or seven hours a day and then working at least eight hours at night. “So Tess took care of Wyatt while you were at class and work?” “Yes. I bought her a used car so she could drive straight from school to pick up Wyatt. Poor kid – she barely had a social life. But she was still smiley and happy every day because Wyatt was actually making friends at this school. He was starting to come out of his shell with people besides us and it was so fucking rewarding. It made everything worth it – to study all night, crush my exams in the morning, work a ten-hour shift at the bar and come home to find Wyatt sleeping, his room all clean and all his homework laid out for me to check.” Lukas laughed to himself. “God, he was such a good kid.” “You raised him,” I pointed out gently. “But it wasn’t me, he was just born good,” he murmured, frowning in what looked like awe for Wyatt. “He was just such a perfect kid.” I watched him get lost in a memory. My heart twisted suddenly when I thought about why Lukas might be against having kids. I wasn’t sure if I was right and I wasn’t about to ask for confirmation, but the thought alone made me so sad I needed to hug myself. “So you graduated college the same time that Tess graduated high school, right?” A smile touched Lukas’s lips. “Yeah, that was great. Cam and Emmett threw us a joint graduation party and they, uh – ” He winced, as if his good memory of Cam was fighting the impression he had of him now. “They planned us a surprise with Wyatt,” he finished, letting himself laugh. He thanked Dot as she came by with our food, but he didn’t lose his train of thought. “It was Emmett’s idea, but apparently, they spent a good two weeks memorizing the dance from Napoleon Dynamite because that was Tess’s favorite movie for… a long fucking time.” I giggled as I scooted closer to him, loving all the little details about Emmett and Tess that honestly didn’t surprise me at all. “I still have the video, actually,” Lukas muttered, popping a fry in his mouth. “All three of them were so into the choreography and they fucking nailed every beat. It was such a stupid looking dance, but they took is so seriously that it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life. Especially since I’d never seen Wyatt happier. His friends from school were there and they loved it. They were all running around playing, being loud. Wyatt was introducing them to me and Tess’s friends. He didn’t have any friends in Miami and he was always so quiet, so it was huge for me to see him be a hundred percent himself for once.” “Sounds like you guys did an amazing job. You were kids raising a kid. You have to know that that’s amazing and impressive. You were in college and you were providing for them at the same time,” I said. I felt the need to point out the positive because I knew where the story was heading. I knew the ending wasn’t a happy one and my heart was beating fast because unless I was mistaken, there was a shine to Lukas’s eyes. And I wasn’t sure how I’d fare if I saw him shed even one tear. I wanted to be strong for him, but I knew I’d cry, too. That was just the way I was. If someone I cared for was crying, my body gave me no choice but to follow suit. “Lukas?” I hugged his arm to my chest when he was quiet for awhile. “Can I just tell you that I think you’re incredible?” He glanced at me with a brief smile. Then he brought the back of my hand to his lips, pressing the lightest kiss to it before holding it in his lap and staring down at our interlocked fingers. “I shouldn’t have moved him away from Philly.” “Lukas, you had to do what you – ” “No. I didn’t have to. I commuted from Philly to New York for the first year. I had an offer from the biggest real estate group in the city and I had to take it. I was drowning in student debt, credit card debt, back rent. But I didn’t want to take Wyatt out of school. He was finally having a great time. So I chose to commute two hours each way.” “Was Cam working in New York, too?” Lukas shook his head. “No, he took awhile to graduate. Failed some courses, needed extra credits. For the first year of the company, I took his connections and built them into something big while he fucked around at school and apparently started… some sort of relationship with Tess.” His jaw clenched tight and his hand on the table formed a fist. “I didn’t realize it because I was working so much, but apparently he was trying to sleep with her so he’d swing by the apartment, pressure her to drink with him. He got her so drunk a few times she forgot to pick up Wyatt from school. And those mistakes always triggered her depression. She’d beat herself up, convince herself she was a bad person, and when she was in one of those moods, Cam would always swoop in and ‘take care’ of her, but really, he was just molding her to do whatever he wanted because he knew she was at her most vulnerable. I didn’t realize he was stringing her along for years until a few months ago, when she broke and told me everything.” I cursed under my breath, feeling sick to my stomach. I hated Cam for taking advantage of a girl who was doing her best to be unbroken. She was a teenager who’d spent most of her life raising and worrying for her little brother. She’d sacrificed a normal life so Wyatt would have a fighting chance at one. If I were in her place, I could imagine feeling weak sometimes, lonely and in need of support. The fact that Cam offered it just to mask his shitty intentions made my blood boil. “Long story short, I made the mistake of uprooting everyone,” Lukas murmured, letting go of a heavy breath. “My grandma always used to say, ‘The way we start doesn’t have to be the way we end,’ and I hung onto that the entire time I was saving up for this new life for us. I was so fucking excited to have a brand new slate and a fresh start where we were financially stable, where I could give Wyatt a birthday party and a big Christmas. I thought all that was worth taking him out of school in Philly, and I really believed he’d eventually love it. But he just didn’t adjust. “When he was twelve, I started to realize he had the same tendencies as Tess, in terms of falling into depression. When he was thirteen, he started therapy. He switched schools. But I knew from the teachers that he was getting bullied again at this one, and I was ready to beat the parents of those kids into the fucking ground, but Cam told me that’d only make it worse for Wyatt. But I felt helpless.” Pain twisted his handsome face as he stared forward, his hands grasping at something at something intangible in the air. “I felt so fucking helpless and he wouldn’t talk to me anymore, so I didn’t know what – ” He cut off and shook his head, dropping his hands helplessly into my lap. His eyes were wet as he gave a bitter laugh toward the ceiling. “The best part is I went to work happy that morning because I thought he was in a good mood. It was his birthday and he said he was four years away from the age I was when I sued for custody of them. He said thank you, he said he was proud of me. And he hugged me so hard.” His voice fell to a whisper I could hear the agony in as he went on. “He just seemed so happy. He was smiling at breakfast, but by lunch he was gone. He cut his wrists in his room.” I choked on a sharp breath, tears streaming from my eyes without warning. “Lukas, I’m so sorry,” I whispered, pulling him to me and hugging him tight. “I’m so, so sorry.” I didn’t know what else to say. It wasn’t his fault, it wasn’t Tess’s and it wasn’t Wyatt’s. I couldn’t think of a single thing to say to comfort him because I could hardly stomach the story myself, so I hugged him tight and feathered kisses on his forehead. He wasn’t crying, but he let me hold him and he accepted my comfort. For so long, his expression was stony, unmoving, but finally he looked up at me and held my cheek. With a glassy gaze, he studied me unabashedly for several seconds. His eyes took their time on each part of my face, from my eyes to my cheeks, then my nose and my lips. When he brought his eyes back to mine, he kissed me. “Thank you,” he murmured, brushing a couple strands of hair that had matted to my wet cheeks. He kissed me again before breathing out words that warmed my body from head to toe. “I needed you today,” he said softly, his forehead on mine. “I didn’t even know how bad. I’m just so fucking glad you’re here.”            24     
 LIA   By the time we made a second stop, it was dark out. We had stayed hours in that diner, and another thirty minutes in the parking lot. He had pulled me onto his lap in the driver’s seat and we had sat there together in silence for a bit, my head on his chest and his arms wrapped around me tight. “This feels good,” he had murmured, running a hand through my hair as I listened to the beat of his heart. Once we were back on the road, Lukas seemed almost fully recovered, so when we stopped again, this time at the side of a dark road, I feared something was wrong. “Are you okay?” I whispered as he reached for me again, pulling me onto his lap. But instead of hugging me to his chest this time, he pulled my mouth to his, parting my lips with his tongue and sweeping it in long strokes against mine. I immediately fell into his kiss, moaning into his mouth as he grabbed handfuls of my ass under my skirt. The moment I felt his dick harden underneath me, I yanked at my T-shirt, un-tucking it from my short, pleated skirt and whipping it over my head. “No,” Lukas said gruffly as I reached to unbutton my skirt. “Keep it on. I want you to keep this little skirt on while I fuck you.” My lips curved against his, his words turning me on so hard I found myself ripping at his belt. Undoing its buckle, I flicked open the button of his jeans, jerking the zipper down and whispering yes when I held his heavy cock in my hands. Lifting my hips on his lap, I pulled my panties aside and rubbed his flared tip against my wet length. “Do it. Put it in your pussy, baby,” Lukas murmured as he played with my tits, cupping them in his hands, kissing and licking them. When I sank down on his dick, he groaned against my skin, biting my nipple and groaning when I let out a little yelp. To ease the sting, he sucked on it gently, swirling his tongue over my tight peak and giving a muffled chuckle as my pussy pulsed tighter around him. “Fuck, I love watching you ride me,” he exhaled when he leaned back, his eyes blazing as they trailed from my lips to my breasts to my skirted hips circling him. “Come here.” Grabbing me, he pulled me closer. His green eyes were intense on mine as he squeezed my ass, spreading my pussy and controlling my pace on top of his cock. “This is all I need,” he breathed. “All I need is you. No one makes me feel like this. You make me feel so fucking good, Lia. So. Fucking. Good.” I wanted to analyze his words but there was no way to in that moment. I was stretched unbelievably tight around him, his cock so deep inside me I could feel him in my stomach. My nails dug in the leather of his seat as I felt his every inch and every ridge. I closed my eyes, too breathless to kiss him but his mouth didn’t take no for an answer, catching mine with authority and sucking on my bottom lip. “Lukas,” I hissed when I pulled away. “I can’t handle it.” “Handle what?” How good you feel. How I don’t know how long I’ll even feel you for. How fucking crazy you make me without even trying. I shook my head. “I can’t,” I whimpered as he reclined the chair, hooking his fingers into the waist of my skirt and sliding me up and down the length of his wet cock. “You make me feel too good,” I moaned softly as he caught my breast with his mouth, swirling his tongue all over me. “Likewise, baby. You’re so fucking sweet,” Lukas groaned. “I can’t get enough of you. I can’t sleep unless I’m holding you and I wake up in the middle of the fucking night wanting you. You’re all I think about anymore,” he rasped. “All I ever want is you.” He gritted his teeth, moving me quicker over his shaft. “You make everything better. I’m fucking addicted to you,” he growled, his features tightening as my body shivered over his. I’m addicted too, I wanted to say but the shockwave of ecstasy hit me out of nowhere and sensing it, Lukas pumped faster inside me, sliding my pussy to the tip of his cock and holding me still so he could thrust upward inside me. I cried out with his every push till I pitched forward onto his chest, gasping, making every kind of noise as I came all over his cock. As if the sensation weren’t enough, I felt him get harder inside me, stretching me in the midst of my orgasm. “I’m going to come,” Lukas rasped desperately. “Come for me,” I whispered, gasping for air. “Come inside me.” With those words from my lips, I felt him explode under me, his pleasure bursting hot in my body. I savored his every aftershock, reveled in the words he whispered to me between every kiss he slammed over my mouth. You’re fucking amazing… you’re so beautiful… you’re my weakness. So many sweet words grouped in threes but none that matched the three spinning in my own lovesick head.            25      LIA   By the time we finally arrived at Ritchie’s house, it was close to 7PM. I was surprised and somewhat relieved to see I barely recognized the place at all. The outside, once a paint-chipped white with red shutters, was now coated with fresh layers of dark blue and brown. The lawn was neatly trimmed, actually green for once, and on it was the “For Sale” sign that made me feel as if this chapter of my life were finally and officially ending. “You ready for this?” Lukas asked, giving my hand a squeeze. “Yup,” I said, squeezing his hand back as I confidently rang the doorbell. But I was surprised when the door swung open because greeting me were three familiar faces, none of them Ritchie. “Hey!” they said in unison, pulling me in for a hug. It took several moments in the hug before I recognized my former best friends, Bree and Lyssa, and Lyssa’s brother, Stephen. They all wrapped around me in a group hug that brought me back to high school, and when they pulled away, Bree literally shrieked. “Oh God, who’s this?” she asked, staring at Lukas. “Where is he from and where do I get one?” she asked with volume and pitch that increased with every word. She had always been the hilariously dramatic one of the group – though it was certainly wasn’t that hilarious when she decided to call me a “thankless prostitute” for leaving Ritchie after Gail died. I wasn’t sure where she got the prostitute part from but I wasn’t going to try to think about that now. These people weren’t my friends by a long shot, but I was still interested in leaving things off on a positive note, unlike the first time I left. “Hey Bree, hey Lyssa, hey Steve,” I laughed as I fixed my hug-tousled hair and pulled Lukas inside. “Guys, this is Lukas.” “Lukas,” Lyssa repeated, unblinking as she held out her hand to Lukas. “And you’re Lia’s… friend?” “Boyfriend,” Lukas corrected casually. He grinned as everyone, Stephen included, turned to look at me in surprise. “That’s too crazy,” Lyssa remarked after a bit of quiet, exchanging a look with Bree. “How crazy is that, Bree?” “Not even over it yet.” I smiled stiffly, oddly uncomfortable. After craning his neck to look out the window, Stephen stared at Lukas. “Nice fucking car, man. You rich?” “Stephen!” the girls scolded just as I heard several pairs of footsteps coming up from the basement. I felt Lukas’s hand slip back into mine as I saw an unfamiliar redhead in tiny ripped shorts. Following closely behind her was Ritchie. Well, there he is. Looking exactly the same. If I was surprised by anything, it was the fact that I felt not even the slightest pang of emotion as Ritchie’s eyes caught mine. Unlike the exterior of the house, my ex hadn’t changed. Not even a little. He still had the same shaggy, light brown hair that he had to keep pushing out of his face, and he still wore the same oversized Billabong T-shirt under a plaid red shirt. For the record, he didn’t surf or skate. He just loved that damned shirt. “Hey…” he finally said, his eyes quickly leaving mine to stare at Lukas. “Who’s this guy?” “Ritchie, this is Lukas,” I said. I felt Lukas squeeze my hand. “My boyfriend.” Ritchie couldn’t contain his surprise. “No shit.” “No shit,” Lukas and I repeated at once. Bree gasped. “They already finish each other’s sentences!” “No, Bree, that was just them saying the same – you know what, forget it,” Lyssa laughed dryly as Stephen jabbed his finger out the window. “Yo, check out his car,” he said, wiggling his eyebrows. “Guys,” I frowned, mortified when Ritchie actually went over the window to look at the Range Rover. “I should be honest, it’s not mine. Borrowed from a friend,” Lukas laughed. “Who’s your friend? Is he rich?” Bree whispered, as if whispering made her question less tacky. “You don’t have to answer that,” I said to Lukas, exchanging a polite laugh with Bree, who polite laughed right back. “Right. Well, uh, I have some food and stuff in the basement,” Ritchie said, taking one last look at the Rover before turning to me. “I figured we could all catch up there, hear about Lia’s new business and then I could give you the box and you could get going to see your dad.” He glanced at Lukas. “You can come too, I guess.” Lord. I looked up at a grinning Lukas. “You can come too. Isn’t that nice?” I whispered under my breath as we followed everyone down to the basement that had once been Ritchie’s escape when he didn’t want to help me with anything. There were still video game boxes littered all over the floor and pillows and blankets from the bed on the couch, for the nights that Ritchie fell asleep playing Fallout. I could tell from the dry look Lukas shot at me that he was making all the correct assumptions about what this room used to be. “So, this is probably not as fancy as you’re used to in the city, but I got some of your old favorites at least,” Ritchie said, pointing to the flavored seltzer and giant, half-eaten pie of pizza from Lucille’s. “Nice,” I said as everyone sat down, looking expectantly at me. Since no one had thought to, I introduced myself to the redhead sitting with Ritchie. “I’m Lia, by the way.” “Oh, I know! I’m Gina.” She pointed back and forth between
 Lukas and me. “So how long have you two been dating?” Crap. I hadn’t even thought to make up the story for that. I looked up at Lukas. “How long has it been?” I asked. “Honestly?” He rubbed his bottom lip as he tried to think. I chewed back a grin because he looked so damned sexy like that. “Less than two months. It hasn’t been that long.” “Oh,” Bree laughed, sounding relieved. “So you’re not that serious at all.” “Bree,” Lyssa muttered. “What? It’s a normal question!” Bree defended herself. “It’s just a fun little fling thing?” Lukas chuckled. “I wouldn’t say that. I’m hanging onto her for as long as she’ll have me.” He turned to me. “You running away anytime soon?” I snorted. “No plans as of yet.” He squeezed my hand. “Awesome. Let’s keep it that way,” he said as Gina cooed from across the sectional. “So, Liam,” Ritchie started. “Lukas.” “I said that,” Ritchie said, shooting me a look. “Lukas, what do you do for a living?” “I own a real estate company.” “Damn, you own a real estate company in New York City? That’s gotta make a lot of money,” Ritchie said, leaning forward. “Tell me something – are you Lia’s investor?” I stared at Ritchie as Lukas laughed. “No, I’m not. I would’ve loved to be but I don’t think she would’ve accepted that,” he answered, looking at me. “Would you have?” he asked, lowering his voice. “Not in a million years,” I whispered with a grin. “Didn’t think so,” Lukas smirked. When we looked back up, everyone was whispering together except Gina, who smiled at us. “I hear you make chocolate for a living!” she said excitedly. “I do,” I smiled. “I actually brought some for everybody in case you’re curious to try.” “Oh, totally! Yes!” Reaching into my purse, I pulled out a square box of sixteen truffles that everyone, even Ritchie, oohed and ahhed over. I couldn’t help but glow with pride because every row of round chocolates did look beautiful, their shells perfectly smooth and shiny, their colors complementing each other. There were colors ranging from periwinkle to cream, and toppings ranging from cinnamon sugar to flecks of dried lavender. When Lyssa asked me to explain each one, I gladly did, smiling the whole time because I could almost feel Lukas’s pride as he rubbed my back. “The first row is Earl Grey lavender truffles, the second row is rum raisin, the third is chestnut and the last one is dark chocolate with a churro feuilletine. I know the colors are bright but don’t worry, it’s tinted cocoa butter and it’s all completely edible,” I said, genuinely happy as I watched everyone dig in. “Damn, I don’t know what a foo-ya-teen is but it tastes like fucking heaven,” Lyssa practically growled, staring at the other half of the truffle she’d bitten into. I breathed out in relief, almost certain I felt something in the air change for the better as everyone tried a piece of chocolate. “That’s it. I’m taking your ass to Spain,” Lukas whispered in my ear, feeding me the other half of the churro feuilletine truffle. I held in my giggle as he squeezed my knee. “You think I’m kidding? I’m going to buy us one of every nut or spice I see out there and I’m going to spend every morning watching you make chocolate while you’re ass naked.” “Lukas,” I giggled. “Don’t you want that? I want that,” Lukas grinned. “Oh, you two – just stop,” Bree interrupted. “We’ve got enough sweetness with the chocolates, we can’t have you guys being all couple-ly and cute or we’ll need fuckin’ root canals.” I snorted. “How do you like the Earl Grey lavender, Bree?” “Is this a serious question? It’s like, the best thing I’ve ever eaten. I could eat this and the hazelnut one for the rest of my life and be set.” “Classic Bree exaggeration,” Stephen rolled his eyes. He looked at me. “Though I gotta admit, this rum raisin is dope. I think it’s getting me drunk. Yo – how the hell do you make these so shiny?” “Proper tempering. And the molds I use do help,” I replied just as I heard my phone start to buzz angrily against my keys in my purse. I frowned. “Weird. Sorry, I did put that thing on silent.” “If someone calls twice in a row, the second call comes through,” Lyssa offered. “Meaning it could be an emergency. You should pick it up or at least see who it is.” “Oh, shit. Good to know,” I said with genuine surprise that made everyone chuckle and laugh. Fishing through my purse, I found my phone, letting out a little gasp when I saw that it was Elaine Gardner calling. “It’s Elaine,” I whispered to Lukas with wide eyes. “Who’s Elaine?” Ritchie asked. “My investor,” I replied hastily as I got up off the couch. “Do you mind if I…?” “No, no! Go ahead. Shit’s important,” Ritchie said. Then he got urgent. “Wait, wait! Before you go…” I turned around with a hint of concern. “Yeah?” “Can I have the last rum raisin?” “Yes!” I answered incredulously as everyone, Lukas included, broke out laughing. My phone was still buzzing but I had to take a moment and snap a mental picture. Lukas Hendricks sitting with my ex and my high school friends, all of us hanging out together in the house I grew up in. My two very different worlds were colliding so hard and it was fucking bizarre. But kind of nice. Okay. Alright. Good vibes, I told myself, my heart beating fast but a smile on my face as I finally excused myself to the corner to pick up the phone.  LUKAS  “So, Lukas.” I knew I’d hear those words the second Lia was gone, and I had a feeling I’d hear it from the brown-haired one with the short, crazy ponytail at the top of her head. I was pretty sure that one was Bree. “Tell us all about Lia. We’re so curious to know what she’s like now. Like, whenever someone moves out of Warren and doesn’t come back within like, six months, it’s kind of a miracle,” Bree said. “Is she workin’ real hard out there?” I let out a breath. “Definitely. I had to chase her to go out with me for awhile. She works hard,” I said, keeping it simple. I didn’t trust these people. I didn’t trust anyone for the most part, but Lia’s former friends fell pretty low on the totem pole. “That’s amazing. She’s honestly always been really good about staying focused. Nothing ever distracted her,” Bree said, glancing back at Ritchie. “Then again, she was dating Ritchie back then and I think we can all agree that Ritchie’s a lot less distracting than you are.” “Bree,” Lyssa hissed as Ritchie flipped her the bird. “Sorry, Lukas. Had I known someone like you was coming, I would’ve briefed these clowns on social skills and manners.” “Fuck you, Lyss,” Ritchie muttered. I eyed him, remembering everything Lia had told me about him. He forced her to drop out of school, forced her to pay him for work he never did. He lied about having a job and played fucking video games at his friend’s house for eight hours a day and took a loan out in her name to tank her credit. For Lia’s sake, I’d gone into this night trying not to remind myself of all the shit he put her through because I understood her need to close this chapter of her life on a high note. I’d never forgive Cam for all the shit he pulled on me and my family but it wasn’t like I savored my hatred for him. It wasn’t fun. It burned inside me every day and filled me with dark thoughts no happy person was capable of having. I wouldn’t want Lia to feel so much as a fraction of that so I did my best to sit through the night a complete gentleman. “So? What did your investor say?” Ritchie asked when Lia got back, holding a hand to her mouth. “Gotham Grocer,” she murmured, turning from them to me. “You know that store, right?” “Yeah. There’s a location near my apartment. It’s nice,” I said slowly, a tentative smile spreading my lips. “Why?” “Well…” Lia made a little squeaking noise. “They’re my first official distributor!” The others gave a collective gasp as I jumped to my feet and kissed Lia. I had to. I made it fast but I made those two seconds count because I needed her to feel my pride and I couldn’t help myself from touching her. When I pulled away, I expected her to be blushing, embarrassed but she wasn’t. Her gorgeous eyes sparkled at me and she whispered, “I’m so fucking happy, Lukas.” Just loud enough for me to hear. For some reason, hearing her say that felt like my own personal victory. “I’m so proud of you, Lia,” I whispered before letting her friends swallow her with hugs and congratulations and questions. It was Lyssa who eventually came up with the idea to pop open the sparkling wine they had upstairs in the fridge. “We bought it for the day Ritchie sells the house but fuck it, this is worth celebrating even more!” she said, taking Bree’s hand, the two of them running to follow Ritchie upstairs. It left Lia and me with Stephen and Gina, who hadn’t really stopped smiling at us since the second we sat down. “You guys seem so nice,” she said. “I love seeing happy couples.” With a groan, Stephen went upstairs, too. Lia snorted as I nodded politely. “Thanks. Are you… with Ritchie?” “Oh God, no!” she laughed. “I just work with him at the bowling alley. He asked me to come over tonight. He said he was having a party but I got here and everyone was talking about this Lia girl and investment deals and money and blah, blah, blah,” she giggled, throwing her hands in the air. “I’m glad you guys are here now, because it feels like an actual party!” she said. As she and Lia got to figuring out if they were even in high school at the same time, I excused myself and slipped upstairs. I wasn’t the meddling type. I was usually far too apathetic to get involved in anyone’s drama but I for some reason felt slightly off about what the other four were doing upstairs in the kitchen. It was a vague hunch but the assholes proved me right the second I got up there. Leaning just outside the kitchen door, I listened to their bitter mutterings to each other. “Honestly, those chocolates were okay, at best. They weren’t even that fucking good,” Ritchie said. “Guys. I swear
 to God, she’s not just making money through chocolate. There’s no way.” That voice was unmistakably Bree. “She’s definitely doing something shady on the side. She’s probably prostituting herself and her so-called boyfriend is probably some rich guy who only came up here because she said he could like, pee on her later. Or some other fucked up shit.” Lyssa giggled. “Seriously. Those chocolates sucked ass. I don’t know how you could bring those here and think you’re so much better than us. I could buy that at the grocery store for like, two bucks.” “Right? Like, good job, you get to live in the city because you’re okay with whoring yourself out. Sorry, girl, but I have standards.” Ritchie’s laugh sounded like fucking wheezing. “God, I’m glad you guys agree. I knew there was no way any of this was real. And that call from her so-called investor?” “Bullshit.” “Total bullshit. She probably made one of her friends call her so she could fake that in front of us to make herself feel better,” Ritchie scoffed. “Fucking pathetic.” Yeah, that’s it. Walking into the kitchen, I watched with satisfaction as everyone’s faces went pale. “Hey!” Bree finally said. “How long have you been there, Mr. Sneaky?” “Long enough to hear you take your collective insecurities out on my girlfriend.” They fell quiet. Ritchie scowled. “Look, dude, we didn’t mean it the way you heard it.” “No, you did, but I get it,” I said. “You’ve got nothing to call your own and the only way to sleep at night is to tell yourself that others cheat their way ahead and your morals are just too high to succeed.” I glanced at Bree for a second before returning my eyes to Ritchie. “Of course, no one with morals takes a loan out in his girlfriend’s name and does nothing to try and pay it back,” I pointed out, satisfied with Ritchie’s dumb, open-mouthed silence. “I mean you dug her a pretty fucking impossible hole to climb out of and she still did, didn’t she?” I paused for him to answer, not that I thought for a second his dumb mouth would have anything to say. After a good silence, I nodded. “Yeah, it has to be tough watching the woman you didn’t believe in achieve everything she’s ever dreamed of. I’m sure that’s hard to live with, so you just gotta find some way to discredit her. Right?” I cocked an eyebrow. “I’d probably do the same if I were a piece of shit whose best talent was doubting others. Thank God I’m not or I’m pretty sure she’d have no interest in me, and that would be pretty goddamned depressing.” I let myself grin a bit. “Because in case you don’t remember or never realized, she’s a fucking incredible woman. And I’m taking her home now, so you guys can go ahead and drink to whatever delusions you think of next. Nice meeting you.” I didn’t wait for a reaction before going downstairs and holding a hand out to Gina. “It was a pleasure meeting you, Gina. I’m sorry to take away the party, but we have to get going.” Turning to Lia, I grabbed her purse and held out my hand. “Come on. We’re leaving.” Despite looking stunned, Lia nodded, saying a last goodbye to Gina before taking my hand and following me out, no questions asked.            26      LIA   “Don’t worry. I’ll get that box from Ritchie and I’ll ship it to you wrapped in lots of bubble wrap, so nothing breaks,” Dad said as I sat with him in the corner of the living room, both of us watching Lukas chat with Uncle Ted and Aunt Lynn at the dining table, which they’d covered with their “good” tablecloth. It was white linen with embroidery at the scalloped edges. Good Lord, I thought as I watched Uncle Ted and Lukas grinning wide at each other over whatever the heck they were talking about. Probably something embarrassing for me. “Don’t worry, Dad,” I said quietly. “It’d be nice if you could ship the box, but you don’t have to. It’s probably just old cookware and stuff we used to make chocolates with.” “If it’s stuff you need to make chocolates for the new… distributor?” “Yes. Distributor.” “If it’s stuff you need for that, I’ll drive over there myself and get it right now,” Dad said, sounding a little riled up as he sat forward on his chair, adjusting his glasses. I looked at him with a smile, trying not to laugh at how adorably huge his already-big eyes looked behind those thick lenses. “It’s really okay, Dad. I don’t need it. The chocolate I’m about to make for the distributor is all getting made in a commercial kitchen. I’ll probably be starting as soon as possible because they’re gonna be big batches. In fact, I’m probably going to need to hire extra hands, which is exciting because it’ll be my first chance to…” I trailed off because Dad was nodding along in the way that he did when he wasn’t listening. I laughed as he pointed curiously at Lukas. “He have kids?” “No, why?” I asked, turning to look into the dining room again. My little cousin, Henry, had come around for the tenth time with a new toy to show off to Lukas. “He’s good at pretending to be interested,” Dad said genuinely. “I couldn’t give a rat’s ass about the things Henry shows me. Kid’s cute but I’m just not good at that stuff.” When he frowned down in his lap, we both fell quiet for a bit. “But hey, you know I’m not a very good dad. What do I need to tell you for.” I took his hand. “Hey. The way we started doesn’t have to be the way we end. I know we have a lot of time to make up for, but we can start visiting each other more from here on out. We don’t have to stay stuck in our ways.” “But our ways are the easiest things to get stuck in,” Dad laughed. “I’m teasing. I think you’re right. We’ll start seeing each other more from now on, and it can start with me bringing that box from Ritchie’s house to you in Manhattan. That’s a good start, right?” “As long as the box isn’t too heavy,” I grinned as Henry came running to us. “Uncle Luke said – ” “Whoa, hey, Uncle Luke?” I snorted, unable to contain my surprise. When I looked up at Lukas, he grinned and shrugged. “Sorry, Henry, I interrupted you. What did, uh… what did Uncle Luke say?” Henry held up his toy Harley Davidson for me to hold. “Uncle Luke said his friend has this one in real life! Like a big one you can sit on. He said if Mommy lets me, you can come with us to see the bikes in real life. And maybe sit on them.” “I see.” I shot a funny look at Lukas that he cocked his head at. “That sounds good, Hen. You let me know when Mommy thinks it’s a good time to look at the bikes and I’ll make sure I have the day off.” “Yesss.” Henry pumped his fist with a victory snarl on his face that we all laughed at. As if that weren’t cute enough, I was then treated to the sight of Henry racing over to Lukas, taking his hand and walking him down the hall to his room. “I’ll let you come to my room to look at the rest of my toys,” he offered grandly. “I don’t like people touching my toys but you can play with them.” “Whoa,” Aunt Lynn raised her eyebrows high. “Did your boyfriend finally teach my son how to share? Because we’ve been getting calls from school about that problem.” “Well, I’m glad we could be of some help,” I grinned as Dad tugged on my arm. He pointed down the hall. “That one? I like that one so much better than Ritchie.” “Oh, trust me, Dad. I do, too.” “You hold onto that one.” “Yeah, that’s what the diner waitress told me, too.” “Hah?” “My waitress at the diner. She told me to hold onto him with both hands.” Dad nodded. “Well, if she was my age or older, then listen to her. People our age – we know our stuff.” I giggled, especially as Aunt Lynn nodded down the hall with a finger to her lips, suggesting I follow her to spy on Lukas and Henry. I gladly did so, going as far as to slip out of my shoes to tiptoe quietly toward Henry’s room, my heart melting when I spotted Lukas sitting on the floor across Henry, his knees bent and his muscled arms draped over them as he helped Henry assemble a toy truck. Next to him, Henry watched in awe, handing him the pieces. All the while, the two conversed casually about some new recess policy at Henry’s school – no more dodgeball, apparently. I covered my mouth to keep from laughing. Or maybe squealing, I wasn’t sure. I was so touched and so charmed, in actual pain over how damned cute this was. “I took pictures,” Aunt Lynn whispered in my ear, flashing me the screen of her phone. “I’ll send them to you now.” “Thank you,” I giggled under my breath, but it was then that we got caught. “No girls!” Henry yelled. But after Lukas whispered something in his ear, he sighed and said. “I changed my mind. You can come in.” I’d imagined we’d be in and out of Uncle Ted’s house in about an hour but we wound up staying for more than three, having coffee and homemade apple tart in the dining room with Dad, Uncle Ted and Aunt Lynn after putting Henry to bed. I stiffened when Aunt Lynn brought up kids and when Lukas was looking to have them. But he smiled and played it off breezily, squeezing my hand under the table to let me know he was okay. When we finally left, we sat in the car for a bit before driving – our routine now, I guess. “You aced it,” I smiled, holding his hand. I had planned to ask what exactly he heard from Ritchie and them earlier in the night but I didn’t care anymore. All I wanted was to bask in the memory of how amazingly well it just went at Dad and Uncle Ted’s house. Lukas grinned at me. “Pretty easy to ace it with a family like that. It’s all love. You can just tell.” I ran my thumb over the back of his hand. “I didn’t realize how much I needed someone else with me here today.” Lukas looked at me. Leaning in, he gave me a kiss. “You already know I feel the same way.” “Thank you for defending me,” I whispered, kissing him back. “You didn’t have to do that.” “Of course I did. I wasn’t going to let anyone talk about you like that. I’ll never let anyone fucking disrespect you. Ever.” My heart ached. There was something long-term in his words that
 I was sure he didn’t even realize. But from the bottom of my heart, I appreciated it anyway. I scrunched up my nose. “You’re kind of the best. You know that?” “Nah, I’m not. Maybe to you and Tess, but that’s about it.” “I’ll take it.” Putting my seatbelt on, I frowned. “By the way, I’m sorry about my Aunt Lynn asking you about – ” “Don’t,” Lukas said. “I’m not going to hold it against someone who doesn’t know that about me. And I’m sure it was a pretty reasonable thing to ask considering I hit it off with Hank.” “Hank?” Lukas turned to me with a grin bit between his lips. “He asked me to call him that. Cracked me the hell up.” I burst out laughing myself. “‘Hank’ though? Why?” “He said it’s manly.” “Oh God. That’s fucking adorable,” I groaned as we pulled out of the driveway. I waited for us to get back onto the road before taking Lukas’s hand but he read my mind and took mine. And for the next ten minutes of the ride, we were quiet, our hands doing all the talking as he squeezed it or stroked my thigh. I cursed the car for being so spacious because all I wanted was to sidle up to him. “Sleepy?” Lukas asked as I hugged his arm against my chest. “Kind of.” “You can go to sleep. You don’t have to keep me company,” he grinned out at the road. Yes. I took his permission and I ran with it but as I got sleepy against the warmth and hardness of his arm, my mind wandered. The Bailey’s Aunt Lynn had poured into my coffee felt like nothing before but now it was buzzing in my head, getting my tongue a little loose. I wanted to ask something, to confirm a suspicion I had at the diner. And though I held it in for awhile, it eventually came out. “Is the reason you don’t want kids because you’re scared to repeat… what happened?” I asked quietly, breaking the peaceful silence we’d had running for almost twenty minutes now. Even in my sleepy tipsiness, I expected Lukas to get rigid, at least a little angry with me for asking. But he didn’t so much as flinch and when he answered his tone was calm and even. “No. I know I’d be a great father.” “Then why don’t you want kids?” He was quiet for a second, the only sound coming from the low hum of our tires on the road. “Because I’d feel guilty. Wyatt wouldn’t forgive me,” he said, his voice tight. “He’d hate me for raising another kid right when I failed him so fucking badly.” I squeezed his arm tight against my chest because his words crushed me. “Lukas,” I whispered. “Yeah?” “I’m sleepy and tipsy so I hope this comes out right but that’s just… not true. It’s not true at all, Lukas. Wyatt knew that everything you did was for him. He knew the life you gave him was worlds better than what your parents could’ve ever provided. You were a kid yourself back then, and you still did amazingly,” I whispered, staring out at the dark road, in sheer awe of Lukas as I thought about it again. “You were twenty years old and raising children. You were only twenty-five when you moved them to a new home for a better life. And you know Wyatt appreciated everything you sacrificed for him and Tess. He was only sixteen and he knew you could recognize that you were barely that much older than him when you sued for custody.” I didn’t look up at Lukas, but I moved my cheek to kiss his arm. A tear fell from the corner of my eye onto his sleeve. I wiped at it before turning my eyes back to the road. “Wherever Wyatt is now, he’s at peace. And from your stories, from the way you described him I know that he can’t be anything but happy when he thinks about you. You gave him everything you had and he made sure to let you know that. He would never be mad at you for anything. I know it.” I wasn’t sure why I was so confident but I was, and I felt adamant about letting Lukas know before I fell asleep and lost my words. For awhile, he said nothing. The hum of the tires continued to put me to sleep. But just before I drifted off, I felt him press his lips against the top of my head, giving me a kiss before whispering three words. Not the ones I ached for, but they were still so good. “Thank you, baby.” Simple but sweet, and the perfect lullaby to send me drifting off into slumber.            27      LIA   In the morning, I woke up to the sound of bumping and thumping in the hallway. Sitting up in bed, I noticed the other side empty and my shower running in the bathroom. With a little smile, I got up and snuck in, peeling the shower curtain back a bit so I could start my morning with easily the best view I could think of. “Lord,” I whispered as I gazed at the water trickling down the slanted cuts of muscle in Lukas’s back. I got a good, hard look at his ass before he turned with his good, hard dick in his palm, his fingers wrapped around his shaft and jerking. “Get in here,” he grinned. Completely forgetting my mission to investigate the sounds in the hallway, I got in, making Lukas laugh since I did so before even getting naked. “This works for me, too,” he murmured wickedly, grabbing the shower head and hosing me down with warm water as he kissed me deeply. I giggled against him, feeling my tank top glue itself to my skin. “Just like the day we met,” he offered, pulling back to groan at the sight of my wet tits. “Yeah. Just like that first day. So romantic,” I snorted as he peeled the drenched clothes off my body. Pulling me close, Lukas pressed his grinning lips over mine. “You want romance?” he muttered, sliding his hand between my thighs. “Yes, I do.” “Yeah, you’re not going to get that,” Lukas smirked, playing with my clit. My eyes fluttered. I wasn’t sure how to take his words but I didn’t have time to think as Lukas leaned my back on the tile, draping my leg over his bare shoulder and lowering himself to a knee. He wet his lips at the sight of my naked pussy before pulsing his hot tongue against my clit. “Holy shit.” My stomach tightened as I clutched the back of his head, and I gulped in a mouthful of steam as his tongue licked between my folds. “I swear to God, your tongue,” I moaned softly, feeling the warmth and wetness of his mouth spreading all over my pussy. I gasped when he pushed my leg up higher to lick where he hadn’t yet. I closed my eyes, squeezing my breasts as I grinded against him. My lips curved into a devilish smile as I heard him jerking off while devouring me. His groans and grunts vibrated with a delectable heat against my pussy. “Are you going to come?” I whispered. “Not before you do, baby. But when I do, I’m going to come inside you.” “Good. I want to feel all of it.” He groaned. “Don’t tell me that right now.” I giggled, pinching my nipples. “I want to feel it drip down my leg.” “Not before I make you come.” “Then make me come now.” I could hear Lukas sneer but with a growl, he switched, gears, lapping and sucking at my pussy with a fury that had me coming in seconds. I moaned as my juices slid onto his tongue and his lips, my body shuddering from the pleasure. I had barely recovered before he spun me around and easily pushed his cock into my sopping wet pussy, giving exactly three strokes before filling me with his orgasm. My breasts on tile and his chest on my back, we caught our breaths for several minutes, the water beating down on our sides. Still throbbing inside me, Lukas massaged my breasts and kissed my neck. He sighed against my skin, sounding unmistakably content. But I gasped when suddenly he gave a hard thrust in my pussy – then another before pulling out and getting wordlessly out of the shower. What the fuck? I was still panting as I stood in there alone, the steam rising around me, confused as to what just happened. Turning off the water, I got out, grabbing my towel and drying off as I listened to Lukas get dressed and then move around in my kitchen. Then I heard him just walk out, shutting the door behind him. “The fuck?” I muttered, at a complete loss for words as I rushed out of the bathroom and got hastily dressed. I pulled on my slippers as I paced toward the door, ready to be furious in case I opened it to find Lukas really gone. But once the door was open, my eyes fluttered with shock. “Tess!” I exclaimed, my eyes wide as I processed the sight of my petite neighbor, her dark hair a little longer and her skin a little tanner. All my previous thoughts flew out the window as I rushed to welcome her home. “Oh my God, it’s been so long!” “I know,” she said, dragging out the word as we hugged tight. “And I hear you’ve been seeing my brother!” she whispered giddily in my ear. I pulled back with a sheepish laugh. “I guess I have.” “Can I just say that I’m so glad it’s you and not Rachel?” I snorted. “I actually have a story about that.” “Oh, I already heard it.” I raised my eyebrows. “Lukas told you?” She giggled her little giggle. If hummingbirds laughed, they would sound like Tess. “Hope you don’t mind that he beat you to the punch. It’s just we talk so much it’s hard for him to leave out fun or funny things that happened with you.” She peered over her shoulder into Lukas’s apartment. Well, her apartment now. “Don’t tell him I told you this, but I know he’s really into you.” I chewed on my lip. “How?” I whispered my question. “Well, just the fact that he talks about you is a miracle. He usually never mentions any girls he’s seen, probably because they’ll be out of the picture so soon.” I nodded, realizing full well that I was probably a pioneer in that department. I had in fact seen Lukas for longer than anyone. He’d let people mistake me for his girlfriend and he’d come to meet my family. We’d covered weeks ago that he wasn’t sleeping with anyone else. But despite his displays of affection, despite his loyalty and care for me, I had zero confidence that he was interested in a relationship. There was still a doubt lingering in the air and after the weekend we’d just had, it dug at me harder than usual. And, of course, there was whatever odd moment we’d just had in the shower.
 I couldn’t explain it if I tried. “So… what is he doing in there right now?” I asked, craning my neck to look inside the apartment. “He’s just packing up his suitcase to go home,” Tess said, sinking a dagger into my heart. “Oh.” My eyes fluttered because right on cue, I watched Lukas come downstairs with a rolling suitcase and several black garment bags tossed over his shoulder. “That was fast,” Tess exclaimed. “Well, I’m pretty excited to get back to my own apartment. It’s been too fuckin’ long.” Another dagger. I watched in quiet disbelief as Lukas shot me a quick smile before heading down the hall with his things. “You have a car waiting?” Tess called after him. “Called it before I started packing,” he called back as he headed down the stairs. Once the front door of the townhouse swung open and shut, Tess rolled her head back and let out a little sigh. “It’s nice to be back,” she said, closing her eyes for a second. “It’s been quite a month.” “I’d have to agree,” I gave a weak laugh. “Anyway, I know you’ve got lots of stuff coming up with the business,” Tess said with a smile. “But I hope we can find a day to hang out and catch up. We can go to the coffee shop across the street or maybe I can join one of your Sundays with Sara.” “Oh, she’s been a workaholic with no time for me lately, so it might just be you and me.” “That’s okay! I can be your chocolate sampler then,” Tess said brightly before we said our goodbyes. Once she disappeared into her apartment, I stood in the hall for a moment. It had been a very eventful hallway in the past five or so weeks but suddenly, it looked just like the one I’d known for years before Lukas crashed into my life. It was so quiet it hurt my ears, and it was so still I could feel a panic starting to rise in my chest. Was it over? I for some reason thought that if this day came, it would do so with a warning. But apparently not. Floating into my apartment, I walked like a zombie back into my bathroom, turning off the light and wandering around several more seconds till I processed the sound of honking outside. Irritated, I looked out my window just in time to see Lukas sticking his head out the back of a black SUV. When I saw he was on the phone, I grabbed mine, answering before it even rang. “What are you doing?” Lukas asked. “What are you talking about?” I countered, rattled with confusion. “Are you getting dressed or what?” I blinked. “What? Am I coming with you?” Lukas laughed for longer than I could handle because I was in desperate need of an explanation. “Jesus Christ. I guess you were tired last night,” he said. “I was talking to you while you were falling asleep. I said Tess was coming back today and we should hang out at my apartment before you went to your meeting. Could’ve sworn you heard because you were smiling.” I was already dressed by the time he finished speaking, my heart bursting with such relief I could’ve cried. But I had too much pride for that. “I’m coming,” I said breathlessly, rushing out my door “My two favorite words out of that mouth,” Lukas chuckled as I flew down the hall and down the stairs.            28      LUKAS   Unsurprisingly, Lia went straight to my new kitchen. I grinned at the door, picking her purse up off the floor and setting it on the dining table. “What are you doing?” I asked as she laid her upper body across the marble island and moved her arms around like she was making a snow angel. I had to laugh. “You wanna sleep on my kitchen counter?” “No! I want to make ten million chocolates on it, oh my God, it’s so beautiful!” she whined, stumbling back to look up at the copper pans I had hanging from the ceiling. “I think I hate you.” “Well, that’s unfortunate because I certainly don’t hate you.” She stopped and looked at me. “No?” “Never,” I said as I joined her in the kitchen, hugging her from behind as she continued to explore. “Do you see this?” she kept asking, to which I repeatedly said yes despite the fact that I wasn’t looking at anything. I had my eyes closed as I took in the scent of her hair and her skin. She was like a drug. She soothed and calmed me down and had me thinking crazy thoughts at the same time. It didn’t help that I was watching her walk all around my place – my apartment, not Tess’s. Letting go of Lia, I slid my hands in my pockets and leaned against the wall with a smile, watching her burst through each area and flit over the windows, pointing at every view. My floor-to-ceiling windows faced north, west and south and she pointed in every direction like she was seeing each for the very first time. It was fucking cute. And just like my couches and my kitchen cabinetry, Lia’s little sundress was an eggshell white, matching her pretty damned well to the rest of my home. Fuck. Crazy thoughts. My brain was hosting a dangerous amount of them as I followed Lia up the stairs, grinning at my view up her skirt. I couldn’t believe it’d been over a month since I met her because I was still so damned curious about her. I was still turned on as hard as I was the first day I saw her in that wet little robe. I still craved her company more than I did anyone else’s. It was also nothing short of a miracle that Wyatt’s birthday came and went with little issue. I was usually a fucking mess – self-destructive and dangerous to be around. I usually went out with Emmett and woke up with no recollection of where I was, how I’d gotten there or why my knuckles were bleeding. Julian generally ignored us for the entirety of the week that we did this. He knew how bad I was hurting and why I needed to do whatever I could to forget, but he couldn’t get behind the drinking, the drugs or the guaranteed violence that was known to follow me during my week of destruction. He generally didn’t give a shit about any of the women I slept with but I knew Julian approved of Lia, just for the fact that she unknowingly saved him from his annual responsibility to pick me up from a random location or bail me out of jail. “Oh my God, this feels amazing,” Lia breathed as she rolled around on my bed. I shook my head at her. “You can’t do that right now. I’m too late for work to fuck you right now.” She giggled, grabbing my pillow and hugging it to her tits. “Are you sure?” she asked, flashing me big, irresistible smile as she continued rolling around. “Nope.” She squealed at the sound of my belt unbuckling, shrieking the moment I pounced on her in bed. She playfully wrestled me on the mattress and I let her till I was too hard to play games anymore. Pinning her down, I guided my cock inside her and for the next four hours – despite the fact that we kept swearing we’d get up and go – we stayed in bed, kissing, talking and falling into each other at a speed that hadn’t stopped accelerating since our trip upstate. I’d never felt it before and I normally hated the unfamiliar but I was pretty sure I didn’t hate this. I was pretty sure I loved it.            29      LIA   “Holy shit, Lia, I’ve written about this place before,” Sara whispered as we followed Elaine through the front doors of the beautiful boutique hotel on Lexington Avenue. It had a doorman and large tinted windows. I’d passed by many times before and always saw shiny, expensive cars parked by the entrance, so I always assumed the place was strictly for the rich and the famous, and that I should never so much as look at it let alone go inside. So I never did – at least not till today. On her first real lunch break in a week, Sara had opted to accompany me to a meeting with Elaine Gardner and Joanne Lee, yet another high-powered woman in her social circle. But considering the swanky location, I couldn’t understand what the meeting was for – at least not until Elaine and Joanne led us from the sleek, dimly lit lobby to the sparsely filled gift shop to the left. “Oh, wow,” I breathed. It was a cozy but sophisticated space that I immediately fell in love with. The tiles on the floor were a retro black and white and the walls were the exact, rich cream color I wanted for the walls of my shop. If anything, the space was slightly smaller than I imagined for my store but considering the location, I didn’t care. It was out of this world and a part of me wanted to ask Elaine what she was thinking bringing me here and making me fall so hard in love – because if I couldn’t afford most of the places in Gramercy Park, how the hell would I afford one in a high-end hotel? But in typical Elaine fashion, she answered my question before it could even come out of my mouth. “So, they’re shutting down this gift shop and hoping to open up a restaurant sometime down the line, but that’ll require a little construction in the lobby to open up more space,” Elaine said, tucking a silver lock behind her diamond-studded ear as she gestured toward the cozy but sophisticated space. “In the meantime, they plan to build a kitchen in what is currently the storage area – we’ll take you back there in a second – but the point is that they’re hoping to rent the space out while they find the right hospitality group to work with to open a lobby restaurant. Basically in the meantime, they’d like to use this as a retail space and because it’s guaranteed to be at most a two-year lease, they’re offering a very affordable price.” “One I could afford?” I blurted as Sara squeezed the living hell out of my hand. “Yes,” Elaine answered with a little smile on her berry-painted lips. “The only downside is that it’s basically a starter shop. Your lease won’t last longer than a year or two but the exposure you’ll get in this location is incomparable and if I were you, I’d fill out an application immediately because there are several others in the know, and they’re desperate to rent here, too.” “Oh my God, oh my God,” I whispered to Sara, who was bouncing so hard on her toes that her topknot was coming undone. “You have to do it,” she whispered back. “I
 feel like it’s the right move, but I’m not sure. I’m nervous,” I said breathlessly. “It’s perfect for you, girl. Look at it this way – it’s like a training bra. You start out here, then you grow your clientele, you slowly get bigger and then you move onto a real bra. I mean a real store.” I was glad Elaine laughed at that because that meant she was one of our people. “Okay, I’m gonna start my application,” I said to Elaine who smiled and grabbed me in a side hug. “I’m glad. I think it’s the right move. And considering you’ll have displays at every Gotham Grocer location, I can guarantee you’ll have no shortage of exposure.” Releasing me from her hug, she fixed her bob. “All that said, I hope you’ve already hired extra hands and rented a kitchen to work in because you need to fill your order by the end of the week.” “Holy shit. Okay. I know,” I exhaled, completely overwhelmed but in the best way possible. Reading my mind, Sara grabbed my hands. “Breathe, baby doll. I’m going to go back to the office right now, I’m going to bang out the rest of my work in like an hour, tops, and then you’re gonna come meet me there so I can help you finish this application. I’ll help you fill out paperwork or I’ll print stuff while you get records from the bank – just don’t worry. We’re gonna fucking do this, Lia. Everything’s finally happening,” she said, grabbing my face and kissing me violently on the forehead. “I’m gonna go now. I’ll call you when I’m done with work!” Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap. Everything was finally falling into place and ready to actually happen. It felt unreal, but I remembered the saying: When it rains, it pours. For the next five minutes, I toured the back area with Elaine and Joanne. But they soon had to return to their offices and they urged me to quickly get going as well, since I needed to get my application in ASAP. “Great meeting you, and good luck,” Joanne said to me as we left together. She gave me a tight handshake and before turning right as I went left, she waved at a stocky, suited man crossing the street. “Hey, Aiden!” “Hey, Jo!” he waved back before flagging me down. “Hey! Hey, hey. One second.” I cocked my head at him, only slowing down for him because he knew Joanne. “Hi? Do I know you?” “I’m Aiden.” “Do I know you?” I repeated. “No, but if you’re coming out of those doors with Joanne Lee, something tells me you just looked at the gift shop space,” he said, walking next to me with a grin. “Possibly. Why?” “Well, I just showed that space to two other clients today and I’m pretty confident their applications will get chosen over yours,” he said, still grinning as if he weren’t being kind of rude. “I mean these guys – these guys have a great reputation in retail, so I can’t imagine them losing the lease to a newcomer like yourself.” “How do you know I’m a newcomer?” I narrowed my eyes. “You reek of being brand, spankin’ new,” Aiden said as I immediately looked around for a cab. I couldn’t peg what the bad feeling was that I got from this guy but I had no interest in finding out. He laughed when he recognized what I was doing. “Don’t get mad, it’s a good thing. You come off as pretty and pure. In fact, that might be your only advantage when it comes to landing this lease. My applicants are men. You’re a pretty girl. I’m sure there are things you could do to get your way.” The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I shot daggers. “Why are you speaking to me?” I demanded. “You know why, Lia.” I stopped in my tracks despite the fact that he wasn’t wrong. I had figured it out a couple seconds ago. He was a realtor. He was six feet tall. He had sandy blonde hair, just as Lukas described. I’d been thrown off for a second because his name was Aiden but then I realized that with most, he went by his last name – Cameron. “I actually don’t know why,” I said between my teeth as we stood across from each other on a busy corner. “I know you want something from Lukas, Cam. But I honestly can’t imagine what you want from me.” “No?” Cam stared down my front. “Well, first and foremost, I’d like to fuck you.” Pig. I turned to leave. The breath hitched in my throat when he grabbed my wrist. “Did I say I was done talking?” “I’m done listening.” “Calm down, sweetheart. As pretty as I think your lips would look wrapped around my dick, I’ve actually got bigger priorities. If you’re down to fuck me so that I float your lease application to the top of the pile, I’ll gladly take it, but since I sense you’re a bit too much of a priss for that, I’ve got another offer for you.” “Let go of me,” I ground out. “Not till I convey to you that I’ll fucking ruin you if you don’t talk to your boyfriend and change his mind about some business between us. Don’t worry your pretty little head about what that business is – he’ll know what I’m talking about.” “I know what you’re talking about, idiot, he told me all about the contract you signed without reading thoroughly,” I said, taking pleasure in the red that flushed Cam’s cheeks. His eyes were unblinking, on fire as he fought to regain his composure. “Feisty girl. No wonder he’s been fucking you so long,” he sneered, wetting his lips. “If that pussy’s as tight as that tongue is sharp then – ” “Fuck off,” I hissed, yanking my wrist from his grip. I felt my hand pulse with numbness as I paced past a group of tourists and into the street, hailing a cab. “You’re brand new, Lia Pope,” Cam called from the sidewalk. “I might not be able to shut your boyfriend down, but you? I don’t even have to be in real estate to crush you, sweetheart,” he said jovially, his every word spiking the beat of my heart. I glanced hastily over my shoulder to find him still standing on the sidewalk, grinning wide, arms stretched out as if shouting a declaration of love. “Come on, beautiful! I’m rich! I have connections and you’re fuckin’ nobody. I know you know that, Lia!” He was still shouting after me as I got into the cab. “Change his mind, sweetheart. With those tits and that mouth, I know you can!” he shouted, laughing hard as my car peeled off.            30      LIA   The sound of a spoon stirring in a glass bowl never failed to calm me down. Under normal circumstances, a panoramic penthouse view of Downtown Manhattan as I stirred that bowl would be enough to coax me into a meditative state, I’m sure, but there were extenuating circumstances tonight. Aiden Cameron, also known as Cam – the same Cam who had terrorized Lukas and his business for months, who had taken advantage of poor Tess since she was a teenager – had just tracked me down six hours ago, stopped me on the street and threatened me. And while it was in my nature to tell myself things were not as big a deal as I’d perceived it, there was no way I was letting my apologetic nature convince me of that this time. What happened today was in fact crazy and concerning, and the light bruise on my wrist was just another reminder. Surprisingly though, I was mentally fine. I was calm. It helped that after the situation happened, I had to throw myself into gathering the paperwork for my lease application. I had the distraction of Sara running around like a chicken without a head, alternating between anxious and elated about the possibility of my new store. With her help, I managed to get my application in within hours of seeing the retail space. We even had time for a round of celebratory drinks. But at the bar, I didn’t tell her what happened. She’d freak out and insist we go to the police and I didn’t have the brainpower to deal with that. I needed to keep my inexplicable calm. My brain had struck a perfect but fragile balance of juggling work craziness and relationship craziness, and I couldn’t afford a new drama to tip that scale. Between waiting on the word for the lease, booking time at the commercial kitchen and hiring hands to help me fill my first large order for distribution, I was suddenly at the edge of my sanity. But at that edge, I was standing on steady feet. I was fine and I could easily stay that way. I just needed everyone to stay calm. “What are we making?” I heard Lukas’s voice ring out from behind me, in the hallway. I turned to see him walking toward me, knotting a white towel under his hips. I smiled. “Nothing fancy. Just making some vinaigrette for the salad right now.” He grinned, drawing his eyes up my black maxi dress before grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge. After opening it and taking a swig, he circled his arms around me from behind. “I could get used to this,” he murmured, kissing my neck. I giggled but upon looking back down into my bowl, my smile faded. I couldn’t enjoy Lukas fully till I told him what happened with Cam this afternoon. I had convinced myself briefly that it was okay not to tell him, especially considering my need to focus and be calm for the coming week of work. But the new side of me – the bolder, louder side that had no time for bullshit – knew it wasn’t safe to keep this kind of secret. Telling Lukas was hard, yes, but I had confidence in myself that I could reel him in – that I could stop him from flying off the handles. So as I prepared dinner, watching Lukas walk all around the huge, beautiful house in just a towel, I tried to figure out how to say everything without sounding too casual or too alarmist. I decided my best bet was to have a normal conversation first, then ease into my bombshell. And it was easy at first, considering the events of my day even before meeting Cam. It wasn’t hard to sound genuinely excited while telling the story of the retail space in the boutique hotel because I really was. “That’s fucking awesome, baby,” Lukas said, pulling my chair over to his at the end of the dining table. Like he had at the diner, he pulled my legs onto his lap. “I know you’re going to do amazing things. You’ve got as much brains as you’ve got beauty – which is a pretty fucking
 astronomical amount,” he laughed, kissing my lips, “so I’m excited to see what you do. I have no doubt you’ll make this brand into something big within the year.” “Me too,” I said quietly, with a small smile. “You don’t seem as excited as I’d expect.” “Well, I don’t know if I got the lease yet,” I said. But I quickly winced at myself because while it was a valid point, it was still an excuse. I knew the reason I was in a tense mood and I had to just say it already. “Lukas, I need to tell you something.” Hearing the severity in my voice, he looked up at me. Upon catching the look on my face, he set his fork down and turned his body to me. “I do too,” he murmured. “But you go first.” I drew in a deep breath. “First things first, I need you to listen to every word I say before you react, okay?” Lukas paused, his expression quickly darkening. “Okay.” I took his hand. “I also want you to know that I’m perfectly fine and I extracted myself from the situation pretty quickly, but what happened is that after seeing the retail space today, I ran into Cam.” My heart beat fast again when I saw the blood drain from Lukas’s face. “He stopped me in the street and at first I didn’t know who he was, but I was suspicious from the start. And when I figured out who he is, he went from being hostile and condescending to full-on threatening. He talked about everything from my business to my body – stop.” I yanked Lukas down when he jerked to get up. “Listen to me,” I said firmly. “I’m fine, Lukas, remember that. I just didn’t want to lie to you about what happened today and let things snowball into madness, so please don’t punish me for telling you. Now can I go on?” Lukas’s teeth stayed clenched together as he answered. “Yes. Go on.” “Thank you,” I said, closing my eyes and letting out a breath. “I asked what he wanted from me and he basically said that he wanted me to change your mind about the buyout contract. He said that if I didn’t, he’d ruin me. That I’m not like your company – I’m too small and too new and he could crush me because he’s rich and connected and all that jazz. And honestly, I don’t know if he can or not, but I – ” I stopped talking when I saw Lukas’s eyes vacate. “Are you there?” “Did he touch you?” My heart pounded in my ears as I considered lying. I probably should’ve. Because the second I answered, “Yes,” my ears were assaulted with the scraping of chair legs on hardwood. I yelped as Lukas’s chair went crashing backwards to the floor, his legs moving so fast to the door that I nearly fell trying to catch up with him. “Lukas, stop!” I shouted, tugging on his arm as he paced toward the elevator. “Stop it! Where the hell are you going?” “I’m going to kill him.” His nonchalance chilled me. “No. You’re not, and I mean it. If you care about me, Lukas, stop and look at me now,” I demanded hotly, relieved but still panting hard when Lukas stopped and turned to face me. But he wasn’t all there and it scared me. “Lukas,” I gripped two handfuls of shirt and held on with every ounce of my strength. “Breathe. Okay? I’m not going to let you beat the shit out of him and wind up in jail. I don’t care if you stay one night or ten, I won’t be able to handle it and I promise you, if you walk out that door, you will never see me again,” I hissed, surprised by my own words. But I meant every one of them and Lukas could tell because I could see the priority shift in his eyes, and I could hear both the fire and ice in his voice as he spoke to me. “Come again?” I dared to let go of his shirt. “I said if you walk out that door I’ll walk out, too, and whatever we have right now, it’ll become just a memory for us both,” I said, still breathing hard. “Because I can’t take another crazy thing happening, Lukas. I’m not wired this way. I can’t absorb all this drama at once and carry on like it’s nothing. It affects me and my heart and I’m in the most important week of my career, so I’m begging you, be calm for me because if you’re not, I will leave.” I could see the flames behind his green eyes as they fixed on me. “You’re not going anywhere,” he said, closing the gap between us with one step. “You’re mine.” “Then don’t you dare go anywhere, Lukas. Show me that I’m yours,” I challenged. “Prove it to me.” “Take your clothes off.” I didn’t hesitate. The windows surrounding us stretched from floor to ceiling, but I didn’t think twice. Pushing the cotton straps off my shoulders, I let my maxi dress fall like a curtain off my body. Lukas let out a rumble as his eyes slid all over my body in just a black lace bra and panties. “Go upstairs.” I watched him as I walked toward the stairs, still wary of him running off to get into some kind of trouble. But his eyes locked on mine like magnets, and his stare was nothing short of electric as he watched me ascend the staircase slowly, waiting for him to follow. My body relaxed once he was walking behind me, and when he gave me another instruction, I was more than eager to follow. “Take your panties off slowly,” Lukas said, two steps below me. “Slowly,” he reminded me. “Just like that… show me your ass. Beautiful fucking ass,” he muttered, grabbing a rough handful but letting go to instruct me further. “Pull your panties down a little more so I can see your pussy. Good. Hold them there.” Keeping my panties peeled down to the top of my thighs, I continued eyes ahead up the stairs. But I had to grip the railing as Lukas slid a finger inside me from behind, teasing my pussy and drawing out my wetness to play with my bottom. He laughed when I paused mid-step in shock. “Bend over.” Hands on the step above, I bent over, crying out as he parted my ass cheeks and slid his tongue into my pussy, writhing around inside till my knees buckled. “Get up.” By the time he said those words my panties were gone. I hadn’t even felt Lukas take them off but they were no longer on my body and I was no longer thinking about anything but feeling him inside me. For God’s sake, I clearly was his because he could simply flip and switch and take over me. It was erotic and terrifying, and it had my pussy so wet I could feel my warm juices sliding down my inner thighs. “Get on the bed, Lia, and spread your legs for me,” Lukas said once we were in the bedroom. My back had barely touched the mattress before he was hovering over me, shirtless, in just those grey sweats. Eyes on mine, he dipped two fingers into my liquid heat. He withdrew them to suck on one and slide the other between my lips. Palming my wetness again, Lukas gazed down at my bra. “Show me your tits.” Pulling the cups of my bra down, I let them spring free, gasping as Lukas grabbed me, rubbing my wetness all over my breast. “These belong to me,” he said, massaging one breast then the other. “These lips are mine.” He drew his wet fingers over my lips. When I sucked them into my mouth, he rolled his eyes back and groaned. “This tongue. This neck,” he dove into the curve of my neck. “Mine.” His sweats halfway down his legs, he shoved into my pussy. “Fucking mine,” he growled, fucking me so ferociously he pushed me up the bed with each thrust. His pace was brutal and merciless inside me, his eyes wild as they pinned to me. But with every cry of his name from my lips, I felt him shudder. When I pulled his mouth to mine and let my tongue glide over his, I felt his weight fall onto me. He didn’t slow inside me but he kissed me back with what felt like love. Tears sprang to my eyes as he whispered into me. “I won’t let anything happen to you, Lia.” He pushed the hair from my face and kissed me harder. “I can’t.” “I’m going to be fine, Lukas. If I have you, I’m fine.” “I can’t ruin you like I ruined them,” he whispered, squeezing his eye shut. “I won’t.” “Easy.” I kissed him, reaching down to grab hold of his ass and slow his pace inside me. “You didn’t ruin anyone, Lukas.” I smiled against his lips. “I don’t think I had real fun till I met you. I don’t think I’ve had happier moments than I have this past month. I’ve loved being with you. I…” I wanted to say it so bad. I loved him. I’d known it in my heart since our trip upstate but it didn’t rise to the tip of my tongue till now. Say it. Say it, I urged. Him or me – I needed someone to say it. “Lukas…” I started, but I couldn’t stop moaning as he slammed deeper inside me. “Don’t stop saying my name,” Lukas murmured. “Please don’t.” So I didn’t. Every time it rolled off my tongue, he touched and kissed a new part of my body. I arched my back, thrusting my body tighter into his arms, which hugged me to his chest. We were pressed so hard against each other now that I could feel his every contour, his every inch and every ridge. We moved together in a synced rhythm. We both sat up now, my body on top of his, my legs wrapped around his waist and our tongues dancing as we rocked back and forth to thrust in unison. I had never felt closer to anyone in my life. I was sure nothing had ever felt so good. Our bodies were sticky, sweaty as we swayed together. We only ever broke our kiss to stare into each other, exposed to each other in every way. When I came, he watched every second of my unraveling, his eyes shining like emeralds as he murmured and whispered to me. “I swear to God, you’re the most perfect thing I’ve ever seen.” He shook his head, unable to pry his eyes off me. “You’re a fucking dream come true.” “Am I your dream come true?” I breathed, everything on my body still tingling. “You know the answer to that,” he muttered, twisting his gorgeous features and letting out a jagged groan. “Fuck, I’m going to come.” He held him tight as he jerked under me, his eyes squeezing closed and his mouth falling open against my breast. His fingers dug into me as I pumped on top of him, milking every drop of cum from his swollen tip. When we collapsed together onto the mattress, my body on top of his, he cupped my cheek. “Lia, I meant that,” he
 breathed. “Meant what?” “That I can’t let my bullshit poison you, too. I’ve fucked so many people over already. I won’t be able to forgive myself if I screw anything over for you.” My stomach twisted, his words striking a wariness inside me. “Everything will be fine. You know I’ll fight whatever Cam throws at me, so why do you have to talk like this?” I whispered, brushing my thumb over his cheek. “Because I never even know as it’s happening,” he said softly. “As what’s happening?” “When I’m hurting someone. I never realize till too late. It’s always when I think everything’s better than ever that I realize everything’s not.” I knew he was thinking of Wyatt when I saw the blankness drift into his eyes again. I held his face tight. “Stop it,” I said, firm again. “Don’t shut down on me now. Okay? Do you see me? I’m the happiest I’ve been in my entire life. I never dreamed I could feel so much at once.” I laughed gently. “I’m pretty sure that if someone like Cam threatened me at any other time in my life, I’d crumble and fold. But I feel strong now. I don’t feel like my only move is to hope for the best – I feel like I can fight for it now. Whatever I want, I can get it myself. I feel like a new woman and I know a big part of that has to do with you.” Lukas broke into a grin. “You make me happy.” “Same,” I smiled, massaging his head as I watched his eyelids get heavy. “I’m so happy I found you,” I whispered, watching him for once get sleepy before me. We closed our eyes as our hearts beat against each other but as I considered confessing my last secret to him, my pulse quickly outraced his. “Lukas?” I brushed my hand across his forehead, pushing back his matted hair. I studied the way his lips faintly curved at the sound of his name and without thinking twice I freed the words my mouth had kept captive for days, letting them finally tumble off my tongue. “Lukas, I love you.” Lying on his chest, I waited for him to say it back.            31      LUKAS   Before I even opened my eyes, I knew she was gone. There were plenty of other rooms in the house for her to disappear into, but I knew she wasn’t in any of them. She wasn’t anywhere in my apartment, and for some reason, I knew that as a fact. In the fog of my sleep, I vaguely remembered the void she left against my chest after breaking free from my arms. I had a faint memory of her kissing the back of my hand before climbing out of bed. But there was no memory of her getting back in, or making any sound around my house. “Shit.” The second my eyes opened, I climbed out of bed, getting dressed fast as I looked around the room for signs of her things. Her panties were on my nightstand but her bra was nowhere to be seen and when I rushed downstairs, I found my floor clean of her dress. The purse she brought – a brown, leather tote of some sort – was nowhere to be found. “Fuck me,” I growled as I paced the floor of the living room, trying again after the first call she didn’t pick up. I heard her last night. I was half-asleep but I’d heard her say “I love you” – I just didn’t say it back. Fucking asshole, I cursed myself as I yanked some shoes on in a hurry. I couldn’t explain my inaction last night. I couldn’t explain it as it happened and I still couldn’t now. I just knew that I’d made a mistake and that Lia wasn’t just up early and starting her day. She was gone. “Hey, Sam,” I was breathless by the time I caught the doorman of the building on the sidewalk. “I’m sorry to ask this but you know the woman I had here the past few nights?” “Certainly do. She’s hard to forget.” “Were you here when she left? Did she look upset or angry or…” I trailed off, feeling like a fucking idiot and hoping Sam would bail me out. “I did see her, Mr. Hendricks, and she was smiling when she said goodbye to me. But your other friend was here this morning. She tried to convince me to let her up.” I frowned hard. “My other friend?” “The blonde one who used to come here sometimes?” I slapped my hand against my face. “Noelle.” “Yes, Noelle. I called your apartment, there was no answer, and I told her I couldn’t let her up unless you were expecting her, so she waited in the lobby. And when she saw your girlfriend, she approached her,” Sam said with a face of regret. “She followed her out and I wish I could have asked her not to but I couldn’t overstep my boundaries, Mr. Hendricks. I apologize.” “Please don’t apologize,” I shook my head, my mind racing. “I appreciate everything you did. Thank you, Sam,” I said calmly despite the fact that inside I was losing composure. I wanted to find Noelle and lay into her for whatever bullshit she had subjected Lia to, barely twenty-four hours after Cam threatened her. I was tempted to take the cab I flagged down straight to her apartment and ask what the hell she even said but I refused to indulge my anger. Lia was the priority. She had been since I met her. So after giving directions to the driver, the car sped off for 18th Street. * * * “Lukas, calm down. If she’s in there, she’s not going to appreciate you practically knocking down her door!” Tess hissed, at my side as I knocked on Lia’s door in the hallway. “What even happened last night? Tell me!” I clenched my teeth, knocking hard for another ten seconds before I gave up and cursed under my breath, leaning my head back against the door. “Cam threatened her yesterday.” “Motherfucker,” Tess breathed out right away. “What did he say to her?” “He threatened her business. Said he could easily kill it before it even started.” Tess swallowed. “Shit. Can he?” she asked, looking especially small in her oversized hoodie. She twisted the drawstrings nervously as I shrugged. “I don’t know. Probably. I can blacklist him from real estate but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s from a family with money and respect. Considering he doesn’t have shit else going on in his life, I’m sure he’d actually take the time to terrorize Lia.” Tess crossed her arms, leaning on the opposite side of the hall. “I hope you’re not blaming yourself.” “Of course I am. You know what kind of life she had before she met me – she knew exactly what was going to happen every day. She was fine. Then I came along and turned her world upside down because I couldn’t stop myself from seeing her,” I grumbled, jerking my hand through my hair. “She was just… fucking hard to quit. And trust me, I tried. I told myself night after night that this would be the last one I cared and the next morning, I’d wake up dreaming about her.” When I dropped my hands from my face, I glared at Tess. “Why are you smiling?” Tess shook her head. “I’m not.” “This isn’t arguable, Tess. I don’t know how the hell to fix things right now and there’s a fucking smile on your face.” She threw her arms out. “I’m sorry!” she said, bursting out laughing. “I’ve just known you my whole life and I’ve never had the pleasure of seeing you in love, so sorry for being at least somewhat amused.” “I’m glad my torment amuses you.” “Well, I’m glad you didn’t correct me just now. So you are in love with her?” I stared at her. “You’re not that clever, Tess, so don’t give me that smug-ass face.” “Say the words. You love her.” I ignored her. “What do I do now? You’re a woman. Tell me.” “Well, for starters, I think you should breathe in and breathe out. I’m sure she’s staying with Sara but she’s going to have to come back here at some point to get her work stuff.” “And you’ll tell me the second you hear her?” “No, I’m not going to violate her privacy like that.” “What the fuck, Tess?” “Hey, you fucked up by not saying ‘I love you’ back to her when you know you felt it. Also, you fucked up by letting Noelle so much as lay her eyes on her,” Tess argued to my irritation. “With work and Cam and now Noelle, can you imagine how overwhelmed Lia is right now? She needs some time. And if her career is getting as busy as you say, she might wind up needing even more time. And you’re just going to have to give that to her.” “I don’t want to be without her. I don’t think I can.” I could see Tess itching to fire back with some attitude but she softened. ”I know she helped you get through this month, Lukas. Honestly, she helped me, too,” she said, pulling her sleeves up over her hands. “Every time I heard you on the phone, you were so calm and happy and in a way, it calmed me down, too. It’s not like I didn’t spend nights crying over Wyatt, thinking about him, but it helped a lot to know we weren’t both spiraling,” she whispered, laughing softly to herself. “You’re gonna get mad at me but at one point, I texted Julian asking if you were really as okay as you sounded. If you were hiding anything from me.” She glanced up at my unchanged expression, her eyes glinting as she smiled. “He said you really were happy – that you weren’t doing anything crazy, you weren’t blacking out or getting into trouble with Emmett. He said all you were doing was spending time with ‘the girl’ and to me, it felt like a miracle. I was so happy you found love that it gave me something else to think about. Besides Wyatt, besides Cam. And honestly, it healed me, too.” When I looked away, she laughed. “Don’t hide your tears from me, asshole. I’ve cried in front of you enough times.” “Yeah, but you’re my little sister, so you’re supposed to,” I said, putting Tess in hug-slash-headlock I reserved only for her. I kissed the top of her head. “I’m glad we both did okay this month.” “We did better than okay. Especially you.” Wrestling out of my grip, she looked up at me. “You’ll find her and make it up to her. I believe in you.” “Thanks, kid.” I laughed because she looked like a little squirrel brushing away all the hair I hugged into her face. With a sigh, she blew the last lock out of her eyes. “It’s gonna take time is all. I’ve known Lia for two-and-a-half years and she’s spent every day I’ve known her busting her ass to get to exactly where
 she is now. She’s got a lot on her plate right now.” “You’re right.” I tugged on my lip. “Shit. Do you remember the name of her investor? Elaine? Elaine something?” “Dude, I didn’t give you that speech so you’d try to track her down through her investor.” “Yes or no – do you remember the name?” “No,” Tess answered, tugging on my sleeve when I started off. “Where are you going?” “Somewhere. Don’t exhaust yourself trying to stop me,” I snorted, watching her heels drag like she was jet skiing across the floor. “Stop it, Lukas. Give her time!” “I don’t have time. I can’t fucking breathe without her.” Tess let go of me. I heard her stumble back a few steps and glanced over my shoulder at her. When I glanced back at her, she was shaking her head and laughing at me. “Fuck in love, you’re head over heels – kid.” “You might be right about that,” I called back to her as I headed down the stairs.            32      LUKAS   Thank God for that hot night at the hotel, when Lia left her phone with Sara. Had it not happened, I’d have no idea where to find that workaholic friend of hers. Riding the elevator up to the fifteenth floor of the Tate Building, I knew well I wouldn’t get anything out of Sara. Any question I asked her, I was well aware she’d dodge it or refuse to answer. It was precisely why I didn’t tell her that the sole intention of my visit was to figure out the full name of Lia’s investor. My plan was to have her divulge that information accidentally, and to leave without her even realizing what she’d done. I planned on being in and out. Of course, I’d never actually been to the office on a weekday so I wasn’t prepared for the sheer amount of women on the floor, all of them turning to blatantly stare at me as I stepped off the elevator. Hilariously enough, Sara’s head, plugged in with ear buds, was the only one that didn’t turn. “Hi, is it alright if I ask Sara a question really quickly?” I asked the girl at reception. She quickly fluffed her hair before answering my question. “Umm, is she expecting you?” “Not at all,” I smiled. “Oh,” she smiled back, covering her mouth. “Um…” “It’ll just be a second.” “I know she’s really busy but I’ll make the exception for you,” the girl giggled, pointing me toward Sara’s desk. “Thanks.” I gave her a wink that she blushed at before I went off toward Sara’s desk. But there was still a fair amount of red tape to get through before I got to her, and that red tape’s name was Rachel. “Hold up.” I turned to see her getting up from her desk. “My neighbor!” she hissed to her surrounding coworkers before turning to me with her mouth wide open. “Lukas Hendricks, what is your fine ass doing here?” She walked out of her cubicle with her arms outstretched, shoving her tits against me as she gave me a hug. “Are you here to see me? Tell me you’re here to see me.” “I’m here to see Sara.” “Well, if you’re sleeping with her now I hope I’m next in line,” she giggled. “I’m not sleeping with anyone but my girlfriend, Lia, but thank you for the offer,” I said, peeling her gently off me. She was stunned long enough for me to escape, but I heard her mutter behind me as I headed off. “So that’s really a thing?” “Oh, it’s really a thing,” I tossed over my shoulder before reaching Sara’s cubicle and tapping her shoulder. Like the last time I saw her, her dark mass of hair was piled at the top of her head and she was typing faster than I knew humans could. She held up a finger, likely assuming I was a colleague, before turning around. Of course when she finally did, her eyes bugged out. “Whoa. Hi,” she said curtly, yanking out her left ear bud. I grinned. “Hi. Can we talk?” Her dark eyes scanned the room behind me. She wrinkled her nose at what I assumed was everyone staring at her. She craned her neck to look over the wall of her cubicle, wrinkling her nose at the occupied conference room. “Can’t it wait till everyone leaves?” “No.” Her eyes darted around once more. “You do realize there are thirty women staring at you right now, right? As you’re about to grovel for information about Lia?” “I’m aware.” Sara sighed and pulled her headphones fully out. “Okay, then please make it quick because I have a ton of work to do and you should know already that I’m not going to give you any useful information.” “No?” “No. That’s how best friends roll. They don’t give up information that they know is private, especially when it involves the person they’re dating.” “Yeah?” I thought about the private information Julian had taken upon himself to offer to Lia. “I have a friend you could probably teach that lesson to.” “He can’t afford me. What other questions do you have?” “You know what I’m going to ask. Where is she?” “Working. She’s making tons and tons of beautiful truffles as we speak.” “Do you know which kitchen she rented?” Sara took a sip of her tea. “Yes.” I cocked an eyebrow. “Are you going to tell me?” “No.” “Does Elise Allen know?” Sara squinted and made a face at me. “Who?” “The investor.” Sara snorted. “Elaine Gardner,” Sara corrected, compelling me to grin. “And no, I doubt she knows because Lia changed her mind last minute about where to rent. So… sorry.” Her hands still cupped around her tea, she shrugged. “Any more questions? Or are we done here?” “We’re done,” I smirked. “Thanks, Sara. You helped a lot,” I added as she narrowed suspicious eyes at me, joining the rest of her colleagues in staring me down as I turned around and got the hell out of that place.            33      LIA   I was running on fumes. The worst part was I couldn’t even sleep during the one-and-a-half hour train ride here. My brain was still in lockdown mode, refusing to rest until it knew everything I needed done was finally done. Technically, it was. In the past week, I’d rented a commercial kitchen for cheap from a friend of Sara’s, I’d scoured a stack of resumes to hire three other sets of hands and I’d spent a minimum of twelve hours a day tempering, pouring, piping, painting and cooling my chocolate. I’d produced literally thousands of glassy, shiny perfect little truffles and bon bons. I practically sleepwalked my way out of the kitchen every night, got on the train and floated up to Sara’s apartment to crash on her couch for four hours tops. Then I was up again, ready to rinse and repeat. Exhaustion was such an understatement I would slap the word if I could. Of course, a part of me was grateful for it because it helped me forget everything else – as much as I could at least. “Hey there, I’m here to run a sample station today,” I greeted the first employee I saw upon walking into the Long Island location of Gotham Grocer. “Would it be possible to speak to Chris? That’s who I’ve been emailing about this.” “Oh. Absolutely!” the girl smiled. “Please feel free to wait by the café while I go get Chris.” “Thank you,” I said, hoping the smile I returned was a passing human smile. I was just so damned tired that I couldn’t even tell. In fact, I couldn’t even muster up the excitement to be here, despite the fact that I’d fantasized for more than five years about having a distributor carry my chocolate. It had been a more feasible dream to me than opening up my own store, so back in Ritchie and Gail’s kitchen, I used to always fantasize that the corner deli would one day give me some tiny display. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that a beautiful store like Gotham Grocer would be the first to really do it. It was a gourmet market I’d only become acquainted with upon moving to Manhattan – and even then, I rarely went in because as just a grocery store, it felt completely out of my league with its big windows, fancy coffee bar and ornate displays. It was my aspirational store to merely shop at, so selling my product at a place like this easily my oldest dream come true. Yet here I was, too mentally and physically drained to even care. I’d actually convinced myself I could leave Lukas and dive right back into the focus I had before he waltzed into my life, but I couldn’t. It was impossible. I went to bed thinking about him and I woke up with a smile on my face because he’d been in my dreams. I had to delete his number in my phone because it was my instinct to call him every time I needed a pick-me-up. I missed him so much it gave me an actual heartache I had to rub out with my palm over my chest. But I had to nip it in the bud. I told myself it wasn’t about Noelle. That maybe he was already asleep when I said “I love you.” I told myself a lot of things but in the end, the final message was that I was scared. I was scared of how fast I fell, how hard I fell and how it might very well crash and burn. I was scared I’d overestimated myself – that my brain couldn’t in fact handle starting a business and falling in love. Especially when that love came with the constant threat of Aiden Cameron trying to bring be down. For days, I dreamt of him planting dead rats in my shop and calling the Department of Health. I dreamt of him showing up at my door or watching me on the street. It was a lot all at once. And yeah – when it rains, it pours. I kept reminding myself that but apparently, the storm was just a little stronger than I was. “Hey, Lia? Chris.” I looked up to find that Chris was a lady. “Oh, hi,” I smiled as I shook her hand, finding myself brightened by the way she beamed at me. “Nice to finally meet you. Thank you so much for having me today, by the way.” “No problem at all!” she brushed it off. “We’re so happy to have you. The team actually sat right where you’re sitting pre-shift and had some truffles with their morning coffee. Amazing, by the way, so thanks for starting our days off right!” I laughed. “My pleasure. I’m so happy to hear that.” Smoothing down the front of my dress, I tried to remember the details of our emails. “So, I recall you said that to set up the sample station, I have to actually buy a couple boxes
 of truffles from you and then from there, I guess I can cut them and… set it all up myself?” I cocked my head, the end of my sentence becoming a question because Chris was suddenly looking at me confused, with a slight frown on her pixie-like face. “Sorry, did I say something wrong? I totally might’ve because I’m a little out of it from a lack of sleep,” I admitted sheepishly. “I honestly don’t even know how long I can stand on my feet today.” Chris fluttered her blonde lashes. “Oh! Well, that’s perfect because what I was about to say was that one of your extra hands actually arrived here shortly after opening. Everything’s already taken care of – your sample station’s been running beautifully for hours!” Chris giggled at my utter shock and confusion. “Can’t you see them lining up back there?” she asked, pointing all the way toward the back of the store. I was truly awake for the first time all week as I stood up, going on my tippy toes to look at a slight crowd around a table in the back, next to the sweets counter. My heart skipped a beat when I caught the signature teal of my truffle boxes piled up high on the glass counter. “Go ahead. Go check it out,” Chris giggled, pushing me gently to start my step. Which one of them was it? I asked myself, convinced it was one of the women I’d hired to help me fill my order. We’d become a bonded team over the course of the week. They needed barely a glance at me to know exactly what I was about to ask for, so maybe someone had read my mind about being too tired to run this sample station today. But as I got closer and heard the nonstop giggles coming from the crowd of mostly women surrounding the table, my suspicions began to lean elsewhere. Just like my heart, my feet stopped in its tracks when I spotted Lukas behind my sample station, wearing a white button-down and jeans, looking like he was genuinely enjoying myself as he described my chocolate to the doting women around him. They were in their early twenties to their late seventies, and all of them were clearly transfixed by Lukas as he fielded questions about everything from the flavors to his height and whether or not he was a professional athlete. I stared for what felt like a full minute but it took awhile for me to fully process the scene – Lukas Hendricks, in all his gorgeous, muscled glory, selling my chocolate truffles to a gaggle of adoring women on Long Island. “Oh my God,” I finally said aloud. As if on cue, Lukas looked up and noticed me. His smile as he spoke to the woman in front of him briefly faltered, his green eyes blinking twice to fully focus on me. Stopping everything, he soaked me in as if seeing me for the first time. He didn’t smile for so long that I found myself craving it so when he did, I couldn’t help but smile back. “Excuse me a second,” I heard him say, setting out a fresh box before coming over to meet me. “Giving away a lot of my product there,” I said wryly as he came over. Lukas glanced over his shoulder. “It’s okay, I bought a lot to give away.” Touching my forehead, I shook my head. “I’m so tired I’m not sure this isn’t a dream.” “You’ve got to be beat. I know you worked hard this week,” Lukas murmured, touching my arm. “Lia. I missed you fucking bad this week. I couldn’t stop wishing I could be there for you. Just to cook you dinner or rub your feet at night.” The words alone nearly made me cry, but I blamed that on the exhaustion. “I didn’t really eat real dinners this week,” I laughed quietly. “It was a lot of shoving as much food as I could in my face for breakfast and then a Clif Bar for dinner.” Lukas wrinkled his nose. “That sounds horrible and it actually pains me to hear that.” I laughed, closing my eyes when I felt him cup my elbows and pull me closer. “Lukas, what are you doing here,” I whispered, too tired to make it a question. “Before I answer that, tell me why you disappeared on me.” My eyes stung as I looked up at his impossibly handsome face. I was suddenly too happy, confused and nervous to remember what my answer to that question was. “What did Noelle say to you?” I shook my head for several seconds. “It wasn’t her.” “But what did she say?” I rolled my eyes, hardly wanting to repeat it. “She said a lot of bullshit. She said you two were still sleeping together. She said when I wasn’t with you, you were fucking her at the office. She claimed that you had called her in the night telling her you missed fucking her, and you were tired of me.” Lukas smirked. “You didn’t believe it for a second,” he said with audible pride. “Of course not.” “Did she say anything else?” “Stupid stuff. But – ” I grimaced. “Honestly, Lukas, I’d woken up feeling just… uneasy. I didn’t know what it was and I thought maybe it was everything catching up to me. Before you met me, I was tense and rigid and any tiny switch-up in my perfectly carved out routine would throw me into a panic. And I thought I was just past that with you because for so long, we were together and all I felt was good.” I closed my eyes, relishing in the heat of his chest close to my lips. “I guess I just freaked out and… I’d like to think seeing Noelle didn’t make a real difference but the last thing she said to me was, ‘You know he doesn’t love you.’ I had an argument for everything else she said, but I wasn’t sure I could argue that one.” Lukas gripped his jaw as he shook his head. He was angry at Noelle and I could see it, but for some reason, all I could think about was how sexy he looked. How much I’d missed those big arms and how I needed them wrapped around me right now, more than ever. I was so out of it I almost didn’t know what he was talking about when he spoke again. “You don’t mind if I say it here? In a grocery store?” Lukas asked with amusement, his hand cupping the back of my neck. I leaned back on him a little, enjoying the touch of his other hand on my lower back “I would want to hear it anywhere.” “Yeah?” Lukas held me against his chest. “Then what if I waited till we got home tonight, till after you’ve taken a nap,” he laughed, “and after I’ve cooked you a proper dinner. Would it be okay if I waited then to say it? ‘Cause I honestly never imagined I’d do it for the first time so close to the ten items or less lane.” I burst out laughing and as I covered my mouth, I felt the sleepy tears, the emotional tears and the overwhelmed tears start to fall from my eyes. I giggled deliriously, thanking God for Chris who zipped past Lukas to take over my sample station as I tried to gather myself. “Okay,” I finally said, my voice barely above a whisper. “You can wait a little longer to say it.” “Okay,” Lukas smiled down at me, stroking his thumb along my jaw. “So, in the meantime,” he leaned in to give me the lightest, sweetest kiss on the lips, “let’s get you a coffee and a croissant so you can keep those pretty eyes awake for the next hour or two, and then I’ll take you home and take care of you like any good boyfriend would do. Alright?” Oh God, I was full on crying now. In the middle of the supermarket, right next to the ten items or less lane. Everyone who passed my eyed me curiously, most of them with knowing smiles. One older woman even offered me a sample of my own truffle, saying, “Here, dear, this rum raisin’s so good you’ll forget whatever’s making you sad right now. Quick – it’s the last one.” Probably selfish, but I did accept and eat it, and I actually thought to myself that it was the best thing I’d ever tasted. But as Lukas leaned over to kiss me once more before guiding me toward some much-needed caffeine, I changed my mind. That chocolate was actually the second best thing I’d ever tasted in my life.            34      LIA   I napped on the couch and woke up to the smell of lemon, chorizo and chicken. I smiled in my sleep because my subconscious had been listening for hours to Lukas cooking me dinner. “Mmm,” I sighed as I finally stirred, rolling onto my back and grinning as I stretched because I could already hear him coming to me. “’Morning,” he murmured even though it was night. I kept my eyes closed as he lowered himself onto me, kissing my neck, my shoulders, the tops of my breasts. “Hey. Wake up.” “Mm.” I whined, pulling my blanket up over my head. I laughed when Lukas yanked it back down, pulling it clean off my body and tossing it onto the floor. Pulling me up, he lifted me swiftly off the couch, holding me against his naked chest and kissing my grin as he carried me across the floor to the kitchen. Setting me down on the counter stool, he placed a polished wine glass in front of me. “Say when,” he said, pouring a deep red wine high over my glass. When he reached nearly the top without me saying when, he laughed. “Are you still asleep?” “No. I just need a drink.” “Why?” Lukas frowned. “No reason. Just been a crazy week. Still haven’t heard about the lease. Still got a lot of work to do, more samples to run.” My lips wiggled into a smile. “Also, apparently I’ve got a boyfriend now, so… yeah, it’s been a little crazy.” Lukas laughed. “I know you don’t like to mix business with pleasure, but I hope you know your boyfriend is going to make sure no one fucks with you. Ever.” “Mmm, is that so?” I sipped my wine. “How?” Lukas smirked. “Well, aside from being physically intimidating himself, your boyfriend’s got a friend named Julian who knows… a lot of interesting people.” “Is Julian in the mafia?” I asked with wide eyes. Lukas snorted. “No. But he knows people who’ll take care of things if Cam tries anything despite the restraining orders I’m about to file on his ass.” “Huh,” I nodded with satisfaction as I watched Lukas turn around and check on the roasted chicken in the oven, crispy and brown and almost perfectly done. I grinned at the view of his backside as he referred to the cook time on the recipe once more, adorably determined to get this dinner perfect for me. So far, he was killing
 it on his first official day as my boyfriend – for various reasons but especially because he was cooking dinner shirtless for me, filling my head with vivid fantasies about drinking this view in every morning. God, I want to get used to this, I thought with a faraway grin that only fell from my face when I spotted Lukas grabbing an extra box of my truffles off his counter and popping one in my mouth. He smirked as he turned around and reached for a drink of my wine. “Excellent pairing,” he winked. “I’m sure it is, but I’m not sure why you’re not sharing with me. That’s not very nice!” “I figured you’d be sick of seeing these but go for it,” Lukas laughed, sliding the chocolates across the counter for me. I rolled my eyes at him and lifted the lid of the box. But my entire body stilled when I saw a string of sparkling stones wrapped around the only truffle left inside. My pulse jumped into my throat and I held my breath as I lifted the precious stones off the truffle. When I realized I was holding an elegant, stunningly beautiful diamond necklace, I looked breathlessly to Lukas for explanation. “I wanted to book you a trip to Spain,” he smiled, "but I don’t know when you’ll have your next day off. I wanted to buy you your dream storefront but I know you don’t like me butting into your business. And I’ll say it – I would’ve bought you a ring and proposed, Lia, but I had a feeling you’d be a little freaked out and I don’t think I can handle you running off on me again,” he laughed softly, coming to my side of the counter. “So this,” he lifted the diamonds off my fingers, “is just my way of promising you that I’m all yours. I’m in your corner every second, every day. I want to be your rock. And you don’t have to rely on me because you’re stronger than anyone I know, so I know you don’t need to lean on me. But if you ever want to, I’m here.” He turned my head gently and kissed my lips as he stood behind me, fastening the fine chain around my neck. My tears made a strong return as Lukas turned me in my chair to face him. “I love you, Lia,” he said, his eyes following the slow curve of my lips as I smiled wider and wider, unable to stop. “You surprise me every day with how fucking beautiful you are. Inside and out. You make me feel better and you make me want to be better. I don’t care if you think what I’m about to say is crazy, but I’m going to marry you someday. You’re going to be Lia Hendricks. I’ll make sure of it,” he said, laughing as he kissed away my tears. “Well. At least in our house you will. Outside, you’ll be Lia Pope because Pope Chocolates is going to be too famous, and we don’t want to confuse your customers.” “Shut up,” I giggled, pulling him back to my lips. “I don’t care,” I kissed him. “The chocolates are going to be famous and I’m going to be yours. It’s all going to work out. I believe it a hundred and ten percent.” “You do?” Lukas held my chin as he looked into my eyes. When I nodded to answer his question, he shook his head. “Ah, ah. No more of that. Say the words for me, Lia.” I giggled, remembering how I’d once hated him for making me say things out loud, just to force me out of my comfort zone. It wasn’t too long ago, but it couldn’t be more different now. “I do,” I finally murmured in reply to Lukas, watching him close his eyes, as if to savor my words. When he opened them again, he looked at me with what I could only describe as love and satisfaction. “Can’t wait,” he whispered. “For what?” “The day I hear those words again,” he said before closing his mouth over mine in a kiss. Licking his lips, I felt myself practically float off on a cloud. Right here, in this kitchen, in Lukas’s arms, I had everything I wanted and  – busy days at work followed by lazy nights with the man I loved. It was mundane, borderline boring, but it was my perfect balance. My sweet spot. And with both hands, I was going to hold on tight.            Epilogue      THREE YEARS LATER  LIA   “You’re back! I missed you so much!” Tess squealed, running out from behind the counter the moment I walked in the doors. I’d been away from the store barely two weeks and already, I missed it enough to fall to my knees and kiss the floor – but I refrained from doing that because we had a fair amount of customers, both lining up and sitting down with their chocolate and coffee. Unlike its first location in the boutique hotel, Pope Chocolates now sold its signature truffles alongside espresso – the same rich beans that had been sold by the coffee shop that was previously located here, right across my old townhouse apartment on 18th Street. “I missed you,” I sighed as I hugged Tess. “How’s the store been? Did we get the cold brew in yet?” “All set on that, sister. Don’t worry about the store right now – talk to me about Spain!” “Oh God, I’ve got like, two thousand pictures, but I’ll just show you my favorites,” I giggled, sitting down at a table with Tess. Three years later, Lukas and I finally found the time to go to Spain. Well – we didn’t actually have the time. Things were still insanely busy with both our companies and the trip had actually been a last-minute decision because I’d sat him down one night and told him that due to certain developments, if we didn’t go now, we definitely wouldn’t have the time. We wound up packing our bags that night and informing our staffs the next morning that we were going to be gone for two weeks. Lucky for Lukas, he had veteran employees who knew how to run the ship while he was gone and lucky for me, I had Tess managing my store like a well-oiled machine. She had begun working with me when Pope Chocolates started to get too big for me to handle alone. Hilariously, my first bit of publicity came while filing my restraining order against Cam. Sara swears she had nothing to do with it, but somehow, a few blogs and gossip columns caught onto “fallen real estate prince Aiden Cameron” harassing a little business named Pope Chocolates. Since no one could figure out Cam’s motivation, articles teasingly theorized that my chocolates were so damned good that he was simply obsessed to the point of being deranged. Lukas, Tess and I had spent many nights choking with laughter over the comments section in these articles, which tore Cam apart. Apparently, the city laughing at him was enough of an ego blow for him to leave Lukas and me alone. Thanks to the publicity from that incident, I got listed in an article titled “The Badass Women Behind Your Favorite Brands” and from there it was history. Regular orders, custom orders – they were all pouring in so fast that I’d been forced to double my staff within the first year. And when our lease at the hotel ended just as we knew it would, Tess informed me that she noticed the coffee shop across from her apartment was moving. Everything just fell together. “Hey, look who’s here!” Tess said once we finished looking at the pictures of Barcelona. I turned around to find Sara making the rare midday appearance. She was still as swamped as ever at work, still accepting every assignment in hopes of her well-deserved promotion, but she’d come by today because she knew I had an announcement. And when I told her, she – for the first time in the six years I’d known her – burst into tears. “Are you fucking kidding me?” she bawled, looking to Tess for confirmation that this was true and not at all a joke. “Wait, you told Tess first?” she demanded, her voice still shaking and her mouth still agape as sobs choked from her throat. I tried not to laugh because she seemed to be on the verge of drowning in her own tears. “In all fairness, Lia didn’t tell me, my brother told me. He couldn’t hold it in, I guess,” Tess giggled. “Never thought the day would come where he’d call me and say that but guess things change when you find the person you love.” I beamed because it was true. I had been stagnant for my first twenty-five years, shut myself off to the world for the next two-and-a-half, and then I met Lukas. The day I found him in my hallway, my life changed. And since then it hadn’t stopped. And while I’d achieved so much on my own, exactly the way I’d wanted to, I knew I couldn’t have done it without Lukas being my rock. My husband, my best friend, my everything. He was every important role in my life. And pretty soon, he was going to assume yet another – a new one that he’d never dreamed of before meeting me. But like Tess said, love sparked change.  LUKAS  She wasn’t quite showing yet, but there was something going on – maybe a glow. “You’re just happy my tits are bigger,” Lia snorted as we sat on the couch at night, watching TV as usual, with her legs in my lap and my hands wandering all over her body. “I won’t lie, that’s definitely an added bonus,” I grinned, sucking her nipple into my mouth. “Damn it, Lukas, this is where we paused the movie yesterday, too,” Lia pretended to whine but she couldn’t contain her breathy moan as I let my erection rub against her thighs. “Fuck it,” she muttered, turning the TV off as she reached down between us, sliding her hands into my pants and wrapping her fingers around my hot, hard cock. “No teasing, Lukas. You need to fuck me right now.” That was another thing about her pregnancy – a complete lack of patience to feel me inside her. I took no issue with it whatsoever. Filling my mouth and my hands with her breasts, I moved inside Lia, still in awe of how unbelievably wet she got for me. She was so damned easy to worship, to get hooked on. I still couldn’t get enough and thank God, I didn’t have to. She was my wife now – my best friend, my partner in crime and most importantly, the mother of my son. We were a good five months away from meeting him but we already knew his name – Nicholas Wyatt Hendricks. Nicholas after Lia’s mother, Nicole, and Wyatt after my brother who would have been the best uncle – who I knew was proud of me, wherever he was.
 It took Lia’s help to get me to that belief and whenever I wavered, she was there to hold me steady again. Because like I was hers, she was my anchor. She was the woman who changed me and my life for the better, and every day, I tried to find a different way to let her know. Of course, for the next fifty-two days, I had a new method. Using the deck of cards Lia had bought at the airport in Spain, just so we could pass time till our flight, I’d worked on a little project for her between my breaks working on the nursery. With a black Sharpie, I’d written one thing I loved about her on every card.  21. I love the little sound you make when you stretch in the morning. 22. I love every time you introduce me as your husband to new people we meet. 23. I love carrying you to bed because you fall asleep on me every night on the couch. 24. I love when you kiss the back of my hand. I love the times you do it without even realizing.  It had been like this since I’d met her, but there were a million things Lia unknowingly did that made me stop for a moment and thank God with everything inside me that she was mine. Most of the time, it was nothing – a look exchanged in public, a random memory she’d tell me with excitement. On the outside, it looked like just another moment. But that made it even better.  25. I love the mundane moments I fall deeper in love with you and you have no idea.  There were so many of those moments, and I couldn’t wait to collect more as we made the journey hand in hand, from couple to family. I couldn’t do it without Lia, and I couldn’t live without her She was my happy place. And I wouldn’t give her up for the world.   The End
