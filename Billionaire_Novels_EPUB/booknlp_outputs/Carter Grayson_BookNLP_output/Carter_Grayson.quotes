2943	2972	2940	2940	Ross	85	“ Get Lucas on it right away and stall Cecil . Tell him I ’m thinking about it and I ’ll have an answer for him next week . ”
2973	2983	2984	2984	I	0	“ Okay . What was that phone call about ? ”
2994	3000	2987	2987	I	0	“ Nora fired another nurse . ”
3001	3004	3005	3005	Ross	85	“ Again ? ”

3056	3059	3007	3007	his	85	“ How ? ”
3060	3153	3007	3007	his	85	“ My cousin , Reggie , hired a hospice nurse for his father - in - law who lived with him and Samantha , and he just recently passed away . From what Reggie said , this nurse was a godsend . She was amazing and took very good care of him right up until the end . And if you knew his father - in - law , he was a bastard . I can call him and get her number if you want . It might save you some trouble . ”
3154	3185	3186	3186	He	213	“ I guess . What does it hurt ? Nora wants to be in on the interview since I seem to make piss poor choices in hiring nurses for her . ”
3199	3207	3186	3186	He	213	“ I ’ll go call him now . ”
3208	3213	3007	3007	his	85	“ Thanks , Ross . ”
3214	3220	3186	3186	He	213	“ No problem , man . ”
3240	3245	3246	3246	he	213	“ You leaving already ? ”
3249	3260	3246	3246	he	213	“ Yeah . I need to get home to Nora . ”
3261	3277	3278	3278	He	85	“ I have that number for you . Reggie said you wo n’t be disappointed . ”

3425	3452	3353	3353	I	0	“ I ’m hoping you ’re available for an interview . My sister is in need of a hospice care nurse and you were highly recommended . ”
3453	3463	3464	3464	she	219	“ When would you like to schedule the interview ? ”
3467	3487	3464	3464	she	219	“ As soon as possible . Actually , if you ’re available , let ’s say about an hour . ”
3488	3500	3353	3353	I	0	“ It depends , Mr. Grayson , what ’s your address ? ”
3501	3509	3353	3353	I	0	“ 212 Fifth Avenue , Apt . 21A. ”
3510	3531	3532	3532	Her	219	“ That ’s perfect . I ’m already in the city , so I can meet you in an hour . ”

3662	3689	3690	3690	I	0	“ Ah , I did see the last nurse leave here with her suitcase a few hours ago . Another one bites the dust , eh ? ”
3694	3706	3690	3690	I	0	“ It seems no one can make Nora happy these days . ”
3745	3750	3751	3751	I	0	“ Where is she ? ”
3754	3761	3751	3751	I	0	“ In her room lying down . ”
3795	3800	3801	3801	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
3808	3814	3815	3815	She	97	“ I ’m really tired . ”
3824	3856	3817	3817	her	97	“ I have someone coming here in a little under an hour for an interview . She came highly recommended by Ross ’s cousin . Do you feel up to it ? ”
3869	3884	3857	3857	She	97	“ I ’m up to it . Just wake me when she gets here . ”
3885	3892	3893	3893	I	0	“ Okay . Get some rest . ”
3991	4000	4001	4001	I	0	“ You have got to be kidding me , ”
4008	4016	4017	4017	she	97	“ You ’re the man from Starbucks , ”
4038	4042	4043	4043	She	97	“ Zoey Benson . ”

4140	4143	4137	4137	she	97	“ Carter ? ”

4508	4515	4516	4516	Carter	83	“ Nora , that ’s enough ! ”
4519	4533	4516	4516	Carter	83	“ How much experience could someone your age really have , Miss Benson ? ”
4534	4554	4583	4583	Nora	97	“ I can assure you , Mr. Grayson , that I have more than enough experience in hospice care . ”
4555	4563	4516	4516	Carter	83	“ What ? Two years ’ worth ? ”
4564	4579	4580	4580	I	0	“ Three . I can give you references if you do n’t believe me , ”
4618	4635	4636	4636	she	97	“ It does n’t matter to me . I ’d like to hire you , Zoey , ”
4639	4673	4636	4636	she	97	“ Carter will go over all the details with you and then you can make your decision whether or not you ’re interested in taking the job . But I hope you do . ”

4748	4753	4740	4740	he	241	“ Have a seat . ”
4754	4761	4762	4762	I	0	“ How long does she have ? ”
4774	4865	4765	4765	I	0	“ About two months . The tumor had progressed so rapidly that there was nothing the doctors could do . This is n’t her first battle with cancer either . When she was sixteen , she was diagnosed with non - Hodgkin ’s lymphoma . She underwent a round of chemo and went into remission . If you accept the job , you will be paid on a weekly basis . You will be required to move in and you will be responsible for her care 24/7 . Still interested ? ”
4870	4873	4874	4874	I	0	“ Yes . ”
4877	4883	4874	4874	I	0	“ I am very interested . ”
4884	4964	5007	5007	he	243	“ I ’m not going to lie to you , Miss Benson . I ’m not happy about this , and if it were up to me , I would n’t hire you . Your lack of experience concerns me . But Nora has fired the last three nurses I ’ve hired and she really seems to like you , so you can thank her . I ’ll need you to start tomorrow . Will that be a problem ? ”
4965	4971	4972	4972	I	0	“ I can start tonight , ”
4975	4995	4972	4972	I	0	“ I ’ll just have to go home and pack some things . I can be back here later . ”
4996	5003	5004	5004	he	243	“ Where is home for you ? ”
5012	5024	5007	5007	he	243	“ You mentioned over the phone you were in the city . ”
5025	5030	5007	5007	he	243	“ Greenwich , Connecticut . ”
5031	5115	5124	5124	he	244	“ I see . Tomorrow morning will be fine . You wo n’t need your car because Nora has her own driver on standby . You can pack your things tonight and I will send my driver , Juan , to pick you up around nine a.m. And by the way , your maturity level needs some heightening . I will not tolerate that kind of behavior you displayed in Starbuck ’s in my home and around my sister . Do you understand ? ”
5201	5211	5212	5212	he	244	“ Why are you staring at me like that ? ”
5215	5225	5226	5226	I	0	“ It ’s nothing . Are we finished here ? ”
5236	5239	5229	5229	I	0	“ Yes . ”
5267	5285	5260	5260	I	0	“ Laughter is good for the soul , Mr. Grayson . You should try it some time . ”
5300	5303	5286	5286	I	0	“ Hi . ”
5311	5324	5304	5304	She	97	“ I hope my brother was n’t too much of an asshole . ”
5325	5357	5358	5358	I	0	“ He was , but I ’ve accepted the job anyway and I will be back in the morning . Is there anything I can do for you before I leave ? ”
5366	5381	5358	5358	I	0	“ I ’m fine . Thank you . Thank you for taking the job . ”
5382	5397	5398	5398	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . Get some rest and I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
5411	5418	5419	5419	Carter	83	“ I thought you already left , ”
5422	5434	5419	5419	Carter	83	“ I wanted to make sure Nora did n’t need anything . ”
5435	5444	5445	5445	he	83	“ Your job starts tomorrow , Miss Benson , ”
5448	5471	5445	5445	he	83	“ Do n’t worry about it , Mr. Grayson . I wo n’t charge you for checking in on your sister tonight . ”
5694	5712	5690	5690	her	248	“ I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to wake you . Do you need anything ? ”
5713	5726	5650	5650	she	248	“ No . I ’m fine . I like her , Carter . ”
5727	5730	5690	5690	her	248	“ Who ? ”
5731	5756	5690	5690	her	248	“ Zoey . There ’s something about her that makes me feel not so afraid . I felt it the moment I met her . ”
5757	5767	5650	5650	she	248	“ You just like her because she ’s young . ”
5768	5787	5690	5690	her	248	“ No . You ’re wrong . I ca n’t explain it . Did you feel it too ? ”
5788	5826	5827	5827	She	252	“ No . I did n’t , and to be honest , I do n’t like her . I think she has an attitude and a smart mouth , not to mention her extreme lack of experience . ”
5834	5861	5827	5827	She	252	“ Good , we need someone like that around here , and as for her experience , she has enough as far as I ’m concerned . ”
5875	5882	5862	5862	I	0	“ Oh come on , Carter . ”
5883	5909	5827	5827	She	252	“ She ’s all yours , Nora , but do n’t expect me to be nice or go out of my way to accommodate her . ”
5910	5921	5862	5862	I	0	“ Would it kill you for once to be nice ? ”
5922	5932	5933	5933	I	0	“ Tell me where being nice has gotten me ? ”
5945	5962	5933	5933	I	0	“ If you need anything , let me know . I ’ll be in my office . ”
5985	5993	5972	5972	Holly	75	“ Hey , how did it go ? ”
5994	6000	6001	6001	I	0	“ I got the job . ”
6004	6018	6001	6001	I	0	“ But you ’re never going to believe who I ’m working for . ”
6019	6022	6023	6023	she	75	“ Who ? ”
6033	6043	6030	6030	her	75	“ You ’re just not going to believe it . ”
6060	6070	6044	6044	I	0	“ Zoe , come on . Spit it out . ”
6071	6086	6030	6030	her	75	“ Remember the man from Starbucks earlier today ? The rude but sexy one ? ”
6087	6090	6091	6091	She	75	“ Yeah . ”
6097	6112	6091	6091	She	75	“ It ’s him . Well , I ’m taking care of his sister . ”
6113	6123	6124	6124	she	75	“ Shut the fuck up ? You are not ! ”
6134	6153	6127	6127	I	0	“ Yes , Holly , I am . His name is Carter Grayson and his sister is Nora . ”
6165	6168	6169	6169	she	75	“ Shit , ”
6172	6175	6169	6169	she	75	“ What ? ”
6182	6226	6176	6176	I	0	“ He ’s like a thirty - year - old billionaire . He ’s the CEO of Carter Enterprises and this article calls him a real estate genius and mogul . So , I guess this guy could pretty much own the world . ”
6230	6253	6227	6227	She	75	“ Guess so . But even though he has everything he could possibly want , there ’s something going on with him . ”
6254	6267	6268	6268	She	75	“ You know what they say : Money ca n’t buy happiness . ”
6271	6291	6268	6268	She	75	“ He ’s just so dark . To be honest , I ’ve never experienced anyone like this before . ”
6292	6313	6268	6268	She	75	“ It does n’t matter , Zoe . You ’re hired to take care of his sister , not him . ”
6314	6318	6319	6319	I	0	“ I know . ”
6349	6354	6355	6355	John	73	“ Hey , sweetie . ”
6358	6364	6355	6355	John	73	“ How was your day ? ”
6378	6388	6365	6365	I	0	“ It was eventful . That ’s for sure . ”
6389	6393	6394	6394	Scott	78	“ What happened ? ”
6397	6416	6417	6417	John	73	“ I got a job in the city taking care of a terminally ill patient with brain cancer . ”
6422	6441	6419	6419	his	73	“ Well , that ’s good , but how ? You did n’t say anything about an interview . ”
6442	6499	6365	6365	I	0	“ Mr. Grayson just called me today . He said he got my number from the family member of one of my previous patients . It just so happened I was already in the city , so we met . I start tomorrow . He ’s sending his driver to pick me up at nine o’clock . ”
6500	6504	6505	6505	Scott	78	“ His driver ? ”
6508	6514	6505	6505	Scott	78	“ Who is this guy ? ”
6515	6522	6365	6365	I	0	“ His name is Carter Grayson . ”
6523	6534	6535	6535	John	73	“ The Carter Grayson ? Carter Grayson of Grayson Enterprises ? ”
6538	6546	6535	6535	John	73	“ Yeah . Do you know him ? ”
6547	6555	6556	6556	John	73	“ No . We know of him , ”
6559	6568	6556	6556	John	73	“ He owns half of New York City . ”
6569	6581	6582	6582	Scott	78	“ I ’ve heard he ’s not a very nice man , ”
6585	6654	6582	6582	Scott	78	“ His father owned a small mom and pop real estate company that was going under . After his father passed away , Carter took over , turned it around in a matter of months , and expanded from selling homes to buying and selling properties . He has the biggest real estate company in all of New York . I ’m sorry to hear about his sister . ”
6655	6686	6687	6687	I	0	“ She ’s young and she ’s dying . But , unlike her brother , she has a lightness that washes over her . His aura is just all darkness . ”
6690	6706	6687	6687	I	0	“ I ’m going to go upstairs , take a bath , and get packed . ”
6707	6723	6724	6724	John	73	“ Okay , sweetheart . We ’ll see you in the morning before you leave , ”
6882	6888	6891	6891	Scott	78	“ Good morning , pumpkin , ”
6894	6899	6891	6891	Scott	78	“ Morning , Dad . ”
6905	6910	6891	6891	Scott	78	“ Where ’s Dad ? ”
6911	6950	6891	6891	Scott	78	“ He had an emergency at the hospital . He told me to give you a big hug and kiss for him before you left . He felt bad not being able to stick around and say goodbye . ”
6951	6962	6963	6963	I	0	“ It ’s okay . He has lives to save . ”
7040	7047	7048	7048	he	268	“ Miss Benson , I presume ? ”
7051	7057	7048	7048	he	268	“ You must be Juan . ”
7082	7089	7090	7090	he	268	“ Are you ready to leave ? ”
7093	7109	7090	7090	he	268	“ Yes . Here ’s my suitcase . I ’ll be out in a minute . ”
7110	7114	7115	7115	He	268	“ Very well . ”
7130	7138	7118	7118	I	0	“ I ’ll miss you , pumpkin . ”

7244	7253	7254	7254	he	268	“ I ’ll bring this up for you , ”
7257	7261	7254	7254	he	268	“ No need . ”
7269	7286	7254	7254	he	268	“ I can do it . Thank you for picking me up and driving me here . ”
7287	7296	7297	7297	He	268	“ You ’re very welcome , Miss Benson . ”
7300	7310	7297	7297	He	268	“ It ’s Zoey , Juan . Just Zoey . ”
7329	7338	7339	7339	He	268	“ Good to see you again , Zoey . ”
7344	7358	7341	7341	his	268	“ Good to see you too , Joseph . Have a good day . ”

7671	7683	7664	7664	She	281	“ He can be a little tough to be around sometimes . ”
7713	7717	7718	7718	I	0	“ Good morning . ”
7729	7738	7721	7721	She	97	“ Good morning . Welcome to Casa Grayson . ”

7759	7766	7767	7767	She	97	“ I ate a small amount . ”
7771	7782	7767	7767	She	97	“ It looks like it ’s a beautiful day outside . ”
7783	7814	7744	7744	I	0	“ It is . There ’s just a light breeze and not a cloud in the sky . Unfortunately , we wo n’t have too many more of these days . ”
7815	7824	7825	7825	she	97	“ I want to go to Central Park , ”
7829	7840	7825	7825	she	97	“ Okay . Let ’s get you ready , then . ”

7902	7909	7896	7896	he	96	“ Nice to meet you too . ”
7946	7957	7958	7958	She	97	“ There ’s a bench over there under the archway . ”
7984	7993	7994	7994	she	97	“ This place gives me so much peace , ”
7997	8003	7994	7994	she	97	“ It ’s beautiful here . ”
8007	8020	8004	8004	I	0	“ I ’m sorry if my brother was an ass to you . ”

8039	8049	8036	8036	I	0	“ He ’s not like that all the time . ”
8056	8085	8050	8050	She	97	“ Hell , who am I kidding , he is like that all the time . I just do n’t want him to scare you off or something . ”
8095	8114	8092	8092	I	0	“ He wo n’t . I ’m here to take care of and help you , not him . ”
8115	8157	8158	8158	she	97	“ I do n’t have much time left on this earth and he ’s having a hard time dealing with it . I ’m going to need you to help him get through it . Can you do that , Zoey ? ”
8177	8201	8169	8169	She	97	“ Of course I ’ll try to help him get through it . But I can only do that if he allows it . ”
8202	8221	8222	8222	She	97	“ He wo n’t , but you ’ll have to try . Please promise me you ’ll try . ”

8412	8417	8374	8374	Zoey	97	“ Did she eat ? ”
8418	8437	8374	8374	Zoey	97	“ She ate a little bit . We went to Central Park earlier for a couple of hours . ”
8438	8445	8446	8446	I	0	“ Why did you do that ? ”
8455	8462	8446	8446	I	0	“ Because she wanted to go . ”
8463	8500	8501	8501	I	0	“ And do you really think it ’s a good idea that she leaves the house ? What if she catches something ? Her immune system is weak and you of all people should know that , ”
8506	8530	8501	8501	I	0	“ The risk is high , but she knows that . It ’s good for her to spend some time outside this house . ”
8531	8538	8446	8446	I	0	“ Even if it kills her ? ”
8539	8556	8557	8557	I	0	“ She ’s dying , Mr. Grayson . What part of that do you not understand ? ”
8566	8595	8564	8564	she	300	“ Your job is to take care of Nora , not make me understand what the fuck is going on . I ’m fully aware she ’s dying . ”
8596	8619	8620	8620	I	0	“ My job is to not only take care of the patient , but to also help the family get through it . ”
8636	8653	8654	8654	I	0	“ I do n’t need your help , Miss Benson . Not now , not ever . ”
8659	8668	8669	8669	she	300	“ You need more help than you realize , ”
8672	8680	8681	8681	Nora	97	“ What ’s going on in here ? ”
8691	8710	8684	8684	she	97	“ Carter , I could hear you yelling from my room . Why are you yelling at her ? ”
8719	8745	8711	8711	I	0	“ I ’m not yelling . Now if you ’ll excuse me , I need to go get changed . I ’m going out tonight . ”
8746	8763	8764	8764	she	300	“ I do n’t want you to go out . I want you home with me , ”
8772	8781	8782	8782	I	0	“ I ’ve already made plans , Nora , ”
8786	8794	8782	8782	I	0	“ You always have plans , Carter . ”
8795	8812	8813	8813	I	0	“ I have a life too . I ’ll stay in tomorrow night . I promise , ”
8846	8880	8839	8839	Zoey	97	“ I want to make sure you stored my phone number in case of an emergency , and I want you to clear it with me before you leave this house with Nora . ”
8881	8907	8927	8927	she	306	“ Yes , Mr. Grayson . I have your number stored and I will clear it with you before leaving the house with your sister . ”
8908	8917	8918	8918	She	306	“ That ’ll be all , Miss Benson . ”
8939	8950	8934	8934	she	306	“ It ’s Zoey , Mr. Grayson . Just Zoey . ”
8974	8979	8967	8967	I	0	“ For emergencies only . ”
8980	8984	8985	8985	she	306	“ Of course , ”
9089	9094	9095	9095	I	0	“ Who ’s Angelique ? ”
9107	9116	9099	9099	She	97	“ Did Carter mention her name to you ? ”
9117	9120	9121	9121	I	0	“ No . ”
9126	9135	9121	9121	I	0	“ Then how do you know that name ? ”
9136	9141	9099	9099	She	97	“ She told me . ”
9142	9147	9148	9148	Her	97	“ Angelique told you ? ”
9154	9157	9148	9148	Her	97	“ Yes . ”
9158	9167	9099	9099	She	97	“ That ’s impossible . Angelique is dead . ”
9168	9174	9099	9099	She	97	“ I know she is . ”
9175	9200	9148	9148	Her	97	“ Zoey , you ’re kind of freaking me out right now . Angelique was Carter ’s fiancée before she died five years ago . ”
9201	9210	9211	9211	I	0	“ They were going to have a son , ”
9214	9221	9211	9211	I	0	“ Yes , she was pregnant . ”
9235	9243	9231	9231	I	0	“ He looks just like Mr. Grayson . ”
9244	9257	9148	9148	Her	97	“ How do you know all this ? It is n’t possible . ”
9258	9278	9148	9148	Her	97	“ I have a gift , Nora . Is that the reason your brother is the way he is ? ”
9279	9534	9231	9231	I	0	“ Yeah , pretty much . When I was eighteen and he was twenty , our mother passed away from cancer . It was really hard on our dad and he could n’t recover . A year after her death , he committed suicide to end his pain and suffering . Then , Carter met Angelique and she was the love of his life . A couple years later , she got pregnant and he proposed . They were going to wait until after the baby was born to get married . She was at a crosswalk waiting to cross the street , and when the signal turned for her , she started walking and a drunk driver came flying around the corner and hit her . The paramedics said that she only lived a few minutes after she was hit . They rushed her to the hospital to try and save the baby , but by time they got there , it was too late . Please , do n’t ever tell him I told you this . He does n’t talk about it at all . In fact , he went to great lengths to keep it out of the press when it happened . After that , he changed . He just was n’t the same . Now I ’m dying and he ca n’t handle it . In his thirty years of life , he has experienced way too much death with the people who meant the most to him . ”
9541	9557	9538	9538	her	312	“ He ’s in a dark place , Nora . His energy is very dark . ”
9558	9589	9590	9590	I	0	“ I know , and I ’ve tried to help him , but I ca n’t . I ca n’t die until I know he ’s going to be okay . ”
9600	9614	9590	9590	I	0	“ Everything will be okay . He will be okay . I promise . ”
10097	10103	10104	10104	he	83	“ How are you today ? ”
10108	10121	10104	10104	he	83	“ I ’m fine . I had Sadie prepare dinner for us . ”
10122	10129	10148	10148	He	83	“ Good . I ’m starving . ”
10130	10137	10138	10138	she	97	“ Zoey will be joining us , ”
10143	10147	10138	10138	she	97	“ I see . ”
10154	10178	10148	10148	He	83	“ It ’s okay , Nora . I ’ll go to my room so you and your brother can have some time alone . ”
10179	10198	10199	10199	she	97	“ Do n’t be silly . We want you to join us . Do n’t we , Carter ? ”
10205	10215	10199	10199	she	97	“ If she feels more comfortable in her room — ”
10216	10219	10220	10220	Nora	97	“ Carter ! ”
10224	10244	10245	10245	he	331	“ Please , join us , Zoey . It would be ridiculous for you to eat in your room , ”
10248	10260	10245	10245	he	331	“ It ’s okay , really . I do n’t mind . ”
10261	10281	10282	10282	His	331	“ Enough with the arguing . Nora wants you to sit with us and so you shall . Understood ? ”
10286	10291	10282	10282	His	331	“ Sure . Fine . ”
10296	10301	10292	10292	I	0	“ If you insist . ”
10329	10338	10339	10339	Nora	97	“ Tell us about your family , Zoey , ”
10342	10359	10339	10339	Nora	97	“ So far since you ’ve been here , I never really asked you about them . ”
10360	10375	10386	10386	he	83	“ I have two dads who have raised me since I was a baby . ”
10376	10382	10383	10383	Carter	83	“ Your parents are gay ? ”
10392	10407	10408	10408	I	0	“ Yes . I was left on the stairs of the church they attended , ”
10411	10427	10428	10428	Nora	97	“ Oh my god , you poor thing . So you never had a mother ? ”
10431	10434	10428	10428	Nora	97	“ No . ”
10441	10465	10435	10435	I	0	“ But , John and Scott , are the best parents anyone could ever ask for . They gave me a good life . ”
10466	10474	10475	10475	Carter	83	“ Do you still live with them ? ”
10478	10507	10475	10475	Carter	83	“ I do . Right now it does n’t make sense to get my own place since I ’m not home much , with my job and everything . ”
10508	10515	10516	10516	he	83	“ I guess that makes sense , ”
10519	10526	10527	10527	Carter	83	“ What do your parents do ? ”
10530	10546	10527	10527	Carter	83	“ John is a doctor who works in the ER and Scott is a firefighter . ”
10547	10550	10551	10551	Nora	97	“ Nice . ”
10555	10563	10551	10551	Nora	97	“ I ’d love to meet them . ”
10564	10583	10527	10527	Carter	83	“ They come to the city a lot . Maybe we can have lunch with them one day . ”
10584	10590	10591	10591	She	97	“ I ’d like that . ”
10594	10605	10591	10591	She	97	“ Or maybe we can have them over for dinner . ”
10606	10615	10616	10616	Carter	83	“ No . I do n’t think so , ”
10619	10622	10623	10623	Nora	97	“ Why ? ”
10627	10648	10623	10623	Nora	97	“ Because Zoey is the hired help . We do n’t need to have her family over to the house . ”
10649	10654	10655	10655	Nora	97	“ Wow , Carter . ”
10750	10757	10743	10743	Carter	83	“ Shit , you scared me ! ”
10758	10764	10765	10765	he	83	“ What are you doing ? ”
10768	10774	10765	10765	he	83	“ Cleaning up from dinner . ”
10782	10794	10775	10775	I	0	“ Why ? That ’s what I have a housekeeper for . ”
10795	10807	10808	10808	I	0	“ You ca n’t let these dishes sit out all night , ”
10811	10832	10808	10808	I	0	“ Whatever , but do n’t expect a bonus or anything in your check because you chose to clean up . ”
10839	10842	10843	10843	I	0	“ Wait ! ”
10855	10891	10846	10846	He	83	“ I do n’t expect anything extra , especially from you . I ’m doing this because it ’s the right thing to do . But someone like you would n’t know anything about that . ”
10920	10925	10926	10926	His	83	“ Are you finished ? ”
10930	10954	10926	10926	His	83	“ I have more to say , but for the fear of losing my job , I ’ll just keep my mouth shut . ”
10975	10985	10969	10969	he	83	“ No . Go ahead . Tell me more . ”
10986	11010	11011	11011	I	0	“ Just leave me alone , Mr. Grayson . Please let me finish cleaning up and then I ’ll head to my room . ”
11022	11025	11026	11026	He	83	“ Fine . ”
11053	11064	11046	11046	I	0	“ Hey , sweetheart , how ’s the job going ? ”
11065	11071	11046	11046	I	0	“ That man is unbearable ! ”
11081	11087	11046	11046	I	0	“ You mean Carter Grayson ? ”
11088	11113	11046	11046	I	0	“ Yes . He ’s so rude and mean . I try to be nice , but with him , it ’s becoming impossible . ”
11114	11138	11046	11046	I	0	“ Just remember why you ’re there , Zoey . Do n’t let someone like him distract you from what ’s really important . ”
11139	11145	11146	11146	I	0	“ I know , Dad . ”
11149	11167	11146	11146	I	0	“ What ’s going on with you ? You never let anyone get to you like this . ”
11210	11223	11203	11203	I	0	“ Nothing is going on with me . He ’s just annoying . ”
11236	11251	11252	11252	he	73	“ Are you sure you ’re not developing some sort of feelings for him ? ”
11255	11276	11252	11252	he	73	“ Dad , he ’s a mean and miserable person . How could anyone develop feelings for someone like him ? ”
11277	11285	11288	11288	I	0	“ Okay , sweetheart , just checking . ”
11319	11328	11329	11329	I	0	“ Shit , she ’s having a seizure ! ”
11342	11350	11351	11351	I	0	“ Has she had a seizure before ? ”
11354	11357	11351	11351	I	0	“ No ! ”
11358	11362	11366	11366	her	97	“ Call 911 . ”
11382	11400	11370	11370	I	0	“ You ’re going to be okay , Nora . Just try to relax and breathe normal . ”
11401	11407	11408	11408	she	97	“ I ’m so tired , ”
11412	11432	11408	11408	she	97	“ I know . Just relax . An ambulance is on the way to take you to the hospital . ”
11433	11436	11437	11437	She	97	“ No . ”
11442	11446	11437	11437	She	97	“ No hospital . ”
11455	11480	11447	11447	I	0	“ This is your first seizure . You need to go . It ’s not a choice and I ’ll be there with you . ”
11502	11507	11508	11508	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
11512	11517	11518	11518	he	83	“ I ’m fine , ”
11642	11652	11653	11653	He	83	“ Here , I thought you could use this . ”
11664	11667	11668	11668	He	83	“ Thanks . ”
11675	11691	11692	11692	I	0	“ I did n’t know how you took it , so I just got black , ”
11695	11700	11692	11692	I	0	“ Black is fine . ”
11724	11730	11731	11731	I	0	“ Thank you , Zoey , ”
11734	11738	11731	11731	I	0	“ For what ? ”
11739	11746	11763	11763	her	97	“ For taking care of Nora . ”
11747	11756	11763	11763	her	97	“ It ’s my job , Mr. Grayson . ”
11822	11829	11830	11830	I	0	“ How do you do it ? ”
11833	11849	11850	11850	She	97	“ How do you surround yourself with so much pain and death all the time ? ”
11865	11875	11876	11876	she	97	“ This is what I was born to do , ”
11904	11909	11896	11897	a doctor	347	“ For Nora Grayson ? ”
11922	12006	11915	11916	the doctor	350	“ Nora is resting now . We did a brain scan and saw a shadow in another area . Seizures are common with this stage of cancer . It was to be expected , to be honest . We ’ve started her on fluids and some medication . I want to keep her here for a couple of days just to monitor her and get an MRI . You may go see her but not for too long . She needs her rest . ”
12007	12013	12014	12014	I	0	“ Thank you , doctor , ”
12035	12054	12055	12056	the doctor	350	“ We ’re going to be moving her upstairs to room 205 as soon as it ’s ready , ”
12059	12070	12055	12056	the doctor	350	“ Like I said , do n’t stay too long . ”
12101	12107	12108	12108	I	0	“ She looks so peaceful , ”
12117	12133	12108	12108	I	0	“ The seizure took a toll on her body . She ’s resting comfortably now . ”
12180	12190	12191	12191	I	0	“ Ca n’t you do something about that woman ? ”
12196	12214	12193	12194	the nurse	358	“ It ’s very disruptive , not only to family members but also the other patients here . ”
12215	12261	12298	12299	the nurse	358	“ She ’s been like that all day . We ca n’t calm her down and the medication does n’t seem to be working . We ’re waiting for a room to open up on the psychiatric floor so we can transfer her up there . ”
12262	12269	12270	12270	Zoey	97	“ Does she have any family ? ”
12273	12291	12270	12270	Zoey	97	“ Her neighbor brought her in and said that she has no family that she knew of . ”
12306	12312	12313	12313	I	0	“ Where are you going ? ”
12317	12324	12325	12325	She	97	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
12383	12397	12398	12398	Zoey	97	“ It ’s okay . It ’s time for you to go home , ”
12422	12431	12432	12432	Zoey	97	“ See . They ’re waiting for you , ”
12435	12452	12432	12432	Zoey	97	“ There ’s nothing to be afraid of . They ’re here to take you home . ”
12470	12478	12463	12463	her	362	“ It ’s okay . I promise . ”
12617	12629	12610	12610	I	0	“ What the hell happened back there with that old woman ? ”
12630	12654	12655	12655	I	0	“ She was dying but afraid to let go , so I helped her . It ’s what I do , Mr. Grayson . ”
12662	12685	12655	12655	I	0	“ I heard you tell her that it was time to go home . Why would you lie to her like that ? ”
12698	12720	12689	12689	her	97	“ I did n’t lie to her . She was being called to go home , but she was too afraid . ”
12721	12734	12735	12735	I	0	“ I take it you ’re not talking about her home here ? ”
12743	12756	12735	12735	I	0	“ No . She was being called to go home to Heaven . ”
12757	12767	12689	12689	her	97	“ And you really believe that load of shit ? ”
12768	12783	12784	12784	I	0	“ It ’s not a load of shit , and yes , I do . ”
12802	12834	12835	12835	I	0	“ It is a load of shit . There ’s no such place and there certainly is no God . Believe what you want and live in your fucking fairytale world , ”
12838	12849	12835	12835	I	0	“ But do n’t ever talk to me about it . ”
13045	13048	13049	13049	I	0	“ Why ? ”
13059	13071	13072	13072	I	0	“ Why did you have to put him in my path ? ”
13092	13095	13096	13096	I	0	“ Shit ! ”
13146	13150	13137	13137	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
13162	13174	13156	13156	he	83	“ I cut my finger . It ’s no big deal . ”
13175	13192	13156	13156	he	83	“ It looks like a big deal to me since that napkin is soaked in blood . ”
13193	13205	13206	13206	I	0	“ I said it ’s no big deal , Mr. Grayson , ”
13225	13243	13216	13216	He	83	“ Please sit down so I can take a look at it . You may need stitches . ”
13244	13264	13216	13216	He	83	“ I do n’t need stitches . I ’m a nurse . I would know if I need stitches . ”
13265	13275	13276	13276	I	0	“ Just sit so I can take a look . ”
13305	13322	13323	13323	his	83	“ Wow . You really did a number on this . I think you need stitches , ”
13328	13342	13343	13343	I	0	“ All I need is a butterfly bandage . Do you have any ? ”
13346	13372	13373	13373	He	83	“ I do n’t know . I ’ll have to go check . Do n’t move from this spot . I ’ll be right back . ”
13448	13466	13467	13467	he	83	“ I found this kit in the bathroom . Maybe there ’s a butterfly bandage in here , ”
13486	13490	13491	13491	He	83	“ Found one . ”
13496	13507	13508	13508	He	83	“ But first we need to clean the wound out . ”
13573	13586	13587	13587	he	83	“ I know it hurts , but we have to clean it , ”
13616	13634	13635	13635	I	0	“ Hold this gauze on it while I open up the packet of ointment and the bandage . ”
13652	13657	13643	13643	he	83	“ Remove the gauze . ”
13674	13677	13665	13665	he	83	“ There . ”
13746	13750	13751	13751	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
13755	13781	13751	13751	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . I know I do n’t need to tell you that you should take some Motrin for the pain , right ? ”
13782	13796	13814	13814	he	83	“ No , you do n’t have to tell me . I know . ”
13797	13810	13811	13811	he	83	“ Good . It ’s late . You should get some rest , ”
14168	14183	14184	14184	I	0	“ Jesus , Zoey . You scared me . What are you doing up ? ”
14193	14206	14184	14184	I	0	“ I needed some more Motrin . Why are you still up ? ”
14207	14226	14187	14187	I	0	“ I just finished doing some work . I ’m heading up to bed now . Sleep well . ”
14227	14233	14235	14235	I	0	“ Thanks . You too . ”
14335	14341	14342	14342	I	0	“ Good morning , Sadie , ”
14345	14357	14342	14342	I	0	“ Good morning , Zoey . What happened to your finger ? ”
14358	14375	14407	14407	he	83	“ It ’s just a cut . I was slicing an apple last night and missed . ”
14376	14403	14404	14404	Carter	83	“ It ’s more than just a cut . Do n’t let her fool you . It looked like a murder scene in here last night . ”
14433	14447	14448	14448	Sadie	71	“ You two go sit down and I ’ll pour you some coffee , ”
14468	14474	14475	14475	he	83	“ How did you sleep ? ”
14478	14487	14475	14475	he	83	“ Not too bad . How about you ? ”
14488	14506	14507	14507	he	83	“ It does n’t matter . I did n’t ask you so you could ask about me , ”
14516	14534	14507	14507	he	83	“ I ’m heading over to the hospital before the office . Are you coming or not ? ”
14535	14555	14556	14556	I	0	“ I have a couple things to do before heading over there . I ’ll just take a cab , ”
14559	14563	14556	14556	I	0	“ Suit yourself . ”
14575	14592	14593	14593	he	83	“ Have a good day , Sadie . I ’ll see you when I get home , ”
14596	14603	14593	14593	he	83	“ You too , Mr. Grayson . ”
14638	14645	14646	14646	I	0	“ He ’s such an asshole , ”
14658	14675	14676	14676	He	83	“ Yes I am . I ’m surprised it took you this long to realize that . ”
14703	14708	14709	14709	I	0	“ Oh my god , ”
14773	14783	14790	14790	she	410	“ Is there something I can help you with ? ”
14794	14806	14790	14790	she	410	“ Could you make me up a colorful bouquet of flowers ? ”
14807	14821	14790	14790	she	410	“ Of course . Any specific flowers you would like me to use ? ”
14822	14831	14832	14832	I	0	“ Just ones that are colorful and bright . ”
14835	14844	14832	14832	I	0	“ Would you like them in a vase ? ”
14845	14859	14790	14790	she	410	“ Yes , please . I ’m taking them over to the hospital . ”
14898	14901	14902	14902	Nora	97	“ Zoey . ”
14905	14914	14902	14902	Nora	97	“ Oh my gosh , what beautiful flowers . ”
14915	14921	14922	14922	I	0	“ How are you feeling ? ”
14936	14939	14922	14922	I	0	“ Tired . ”
14940	14945	14946	14946	Carter	83	“ Hello , Zoey , ”
14953	14968	14946	14946	Carter	83	“ Ah . I ’m good enough to say hello to but not goodbye ? ”
15014	15020	15021	15021	He	83	“ I need to go . ”
15030	15042	15021	15021	He	83	“ I ’ll stop by later , on my way home . ”
15043	15046	15047	15047	She	97	“ Okay . ”
15062	15068	15059	15059	I	0	“ Goodbye , Mr. Grayson . ”
15092	15105	15106	15106	Nora	97	“ What the hell is going on between the two of you ? ”
15109	15119	15120	15120	I	0	“ Your brother is a rude , pompous ass , ”
15131	15152	15123	15123	I	0	“ I know he is and I told you why he ’s like that . What happened to your finger ? ”
15153	15188	15120	15120	I	0	“ I cut it last night slicing an apple . Actually , your brother walked in right after it happened and took control . He cleaned it up and put this butterfly over it . ”
15189	15196	15123	15123	I	0	“ Really ? He did that ? ”
15197	15220	15123	15123	I	0	“ Yes . I thought maybe I had witnessed a breakthrough , but he was back to his normal self this morning . ”
15221	15290	15291	15291	She	414	“ The way he is , Zoey , is n’t his normal self . Carter used to be an amazing loving person and he was so full of life . He did n’t have a mean bone in his body . This change I ’ve witnessed for the past five years is so incomprehensible to me and it breaks my heart . He became a victim of circumstance . ”
15308	15319	15305	15305	I	0	“ Get some rest and I ’ll see you later . ”
15335	15338	15339	15339	I	0	“ Hello , ”
15342	15366	15339	15339	I	0	“ Hey there , bestie . I ’m in the city today . Any chance we can meet up somewhere for a bit ? ”
15367	15389	15305	15305	I	0	“ Actually , I can meet you now . Nora is in the hospital . She had a seizure last night . ”
15390	15395	15339	15339	I	0	“ Is she okay ? ”
15396	15429	15339	15339	I	0	“ She ’s doing better today , but they want to keep her overnight again just to monitor her and do a couple more scans . How about Starbucks on Fifth Avenue ? ”
15430	15443	15305	15305	I	0	“ Sounds good . I can be there in about ten minutes . ”
15444	15453	15339	15339	I	0	“ Great . I ’ll see you soon . ”
15496	15511	15305	15305	I	0	“ So , how are you ? How are things going with Mr. Mean ? ”
15512	15534	15535	15535	I	0	“ He ’s unbearable . He ’s miserable . He ’s a rude , pompous ass . Need I go on ? ”
15538	15550	15551	15551	She	75	“ Umm . No . I think you just covered it . ”
15554	15565	15551	15551	She	75	“ Want to know what I think about the situation ? ”
15566	15569	15305	15305	I	0	“ What ? ”
15570	15577	15578	15578	She	75	“ I think you like him . ”
15586	15607	15578	15578	She	75	“ No , I do n’t . How could you even say that after what I just said about him ? ”
15608	15661	15663	15663	her	419	“ Because I ’ve known you my whole life , Zoey , and you never let anyone get to you . You always defended the mean girls in school . So your reaction , this out - of - character reaction to Carter Grayson , is telling me you ’re into him . ”
15695	15715	15686	15686	he	83	“ Wow . Now I have a better understanding why he ’s the way he is . How sad . ”
15716	15738	15739	15739	I	0	“ I know , but he ca n’t take it out on people . The anger that consumes him is frightening , ”
15742	15763	15739	15739	I	0	“ Then make him see there is a Heaven and a God . You of all people can do that . ”
15764	15785	15686	15686	he	83	“ I ca n’t force someone to believe something they are n’t ready for or do n’t want to accept . ”
15786	15790	15791	15791	She	420	“ I suppose . ”
15827	15830	15831	15831	I	0	“ Shit , ”
15883	15887	15888	15888	I	0	“ Hold on , ”
15911	15915	15916	15916	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
15923	15928	15929	15929	He	83	“ You ’re welcome . ”
15973	15982	15983	15983	I	0	“ Do you know where Nora Grayson is ? ”
15986	16002	15983	15983	I	0	“ She ’s having an MRI . She should be done in a few minutes . ”

16406	16457	16458	16458	he	73	“ They were short staffed today , so Ed called and asked if I could fill in . It just so happened I was off from St. Francis today . I was going to call you later and see if you could join me for dinner . Now what happened ? ”

16631	16640	16625	16625	I	0	“ Mr. Grayson , what are you doing ? ”

17094	17101	17102	17102	I	0	“ What was that all about ? ”

17161	17218	17154	17154	I	0	“ We ’ve already talked about this and you said you supported my decision . I refuse to spend whatever life I have left sick as a dog from that fucking chemo ! It ’s not going to cure me . You saw what it did to me the first time and I was stronger then . ”

20326	20415	20204	20205	my secretary	209	“ You ’re bluffing . No one I know would be that stupid . What I do know is that the IRS is closing in to seize your property for your lack of tax payments over the last three years . And once they do that , I can actually pay a lower price for it . I ’m trying to help you out , Cecil . Take what I ’ve offered you and run with it . You know it ’s a damn good and fair price . ”

20763	20791	20735	20735	she	97	“ I ’m not sneaking up on you . You ’re obviously an easily frightened person . It must be all that death you surround yourself with . ”

20808	20817	20818	20818	I	0	“ Do you know what it ’s about ? ”
20821	20841	20818	20818	I	0	“ No . The only thing she said was that she wanted to speak to the both of us . ”
20850	20859	20860	20860	I	0	“ Then we better go talk to her , ”
20881	20888	20872	20872	she	97	“ Good , you ’re home . ”

20992	21064	20933	20933	I	0	“ It is possible , Carter , and this is my final wish . I want to sit on the beach , even if it is only for one day . I want to feel the ocean breeze and smell the salted air through my window as I lie in bed . It ’s getting colder here and I do n’t want to spend my final days in a dreary place . ”
21065	21075	21132	21132	she	520	“ But , Nora , this is your home . ”
21076	21083	21132	21132	she	520	“ So is the Malibu house . ”
21084	21087	21132	21132	she	520	“ But — ”
21088	21106	21132	21132	she	520	“ Carter , this is n’t about you . This is about me and my final wish . ”
21166	21169	21170	21170	I	0	“ Okay , ”
21173	21201	21170	21170	I	0	“ We ’ll leave in a couple of days . I have to get things settled at the office first , plus we ’ll need to pack . ”
21202	21206	21207	21207	She	520	“ Thank you . ”
21229	21238	21239	21239	I	0	“ Can I see you in my office ? ”
21243	21246	21241	21241	her	97	“ Sure . ”
21262	21296	21247	21247	She	97	“ There are a couple things I want to discuss with you . First , about last night . I apologize for my actions . As you know , I was totally inebriated . ”
21297	21311	21259	21259	my	0	“ I know and it ’s fine . Do n’t worry about it . ”
21312	21330	21247	21247	She	97	“ It will never happen between us , Zoey . I want to make that very clear . ”
21331	21351	21247	21247	She	97	“ You do n’t have to make that clear , Mr. Grayson , because I know it wo n’t . ”
21352	21382	21259	21259	my	0	“ Good . Now that we ’ve gotten that out of the way , the second thing I want to discuss is California . Are you okay with going ? ”
21383	21399	21247	21247	She	97	“ Yes . Of course I am . You seem hesitant about it . Why ? ”
21400	21421	21247	21247	She	97	“ I am , but I ’m doing it for Nora . The reason does n’t concern you . Understood ? ”
21422	21425	21259	21259	my	0	“ Understood . ”
21426	21480	21247	21247	She	97	“ The weather there is warm , so I ’m assuming you ’ll have to go home and get some of your other clothes . Since I ’m going to be home the rest of the night , I ’ll have Juan take you now and I ’ll keep an eye on Nora . ”
21481	21484	21485	21485	she	523	“ Okay , ”
21488	21546	21547	21547	She	523	“ I do n’t think her traveling is a good idea . But what can I do ? If she wants to spend what time she has left in Malibu , then who am I to try and stop her . That will be all . Juan will be waiting downstairs for you when you ’re ready . ”
21675	21695	21671	21671	Zoey	97	“ If you ’re going to drink while staying here alone with your sister , I ’m not leaving . ”
21696	21700	21701	21701	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
21708	21739	21701	21701	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Mr. Grayson , but after last night , I do n’t think I can trust you to be alone with her if you ’re drinking . ”
21740	21750	21751	21751	I	0	“ Who the fuck do you think you are ? ”
21762	21772	21751	21751	I	0	“ It ’s one drink and that ’s it . ”
21773	21829	21830	21830	I	0	“ And one drink leads to many others . Especially with the state you ’re in about having to go to California . I know this is hard for you because you know you ’ll be coming back here without her , but drinking your problems away is n’t going to help her or you . ”
21870	21883	21884	21884	I	0	“ There . I wo n’t have a drink until you return , ”
21889	21893	21894	21894	She	97	“ Thank you . ”
22044	22054	22055	22055	Scott	78	“ You ’re okay with this trip , right ? ”
22058	22062	22055	22055	Scott	78	“ Of course . ”
22066	22101	22063	22063	I	0	“ I go to where my job takes me . Their house is on the beach , so it ’ll be a nice change to get out of the city setting for a while . ”
22102	22108	22109	22109	John	73	“ We ’ll miss you . ”
22112	22142	22143	22143	I	0	“ I ’ll miss both of you too . But we can facetime every day if you want . Well , I think that ’s all I ’m bringing , ”
22169	22177	22178	22178	John	73	“ Have a safe trip , sweetheart , ”
22181	22192	22178	22178	John	73	“ I will . I love you both very much . ”
22193	22201	22202	22202	Scott	78	“ We love you too , baby . ”
22275	22287	22266	22266	I	0	“ I just wanted you to know that I ’m back . ”
22334	22337	22338	22338	She	97	“ Hey . ”
22347	22357	22338	22338	She	97	“ Hi . I ’m sorry I woke you . ”
22358	22377	22409	22409	he	83	“ You did n’t . I was n’t fully asleep anyway . Are you all packed for California ? ”
22378	22382	22383	22383	I	0	“ I am . ”
22386	22395	22383	22383	I	0	“ Tomorrow I ’ll help you get packed . ”
22396	22399	22409	22409	he	83	“ Thanks . ”
22400	22405	22406	22406	Carter	83	“ You ’re awake , ”
22415	22420	22406	22406	Carter	83	“ Not for long . ”
22425	22431	22421	22421	She	97	“ I ’m really tired . ”
22432	22443	22444	22444	I	0	“ Do you need anything before you go to sleep ? ”
22447	22454	22455	22455	she	97	“ No . I ’m fine , ”
22458	22465	22455	22455	she	97	“ Okay , get some rest . ”
22471	22477	22478	22478	Carter	83	“ Good night , Nora , ”
22506	22509	22499	22499	Nora	97	“ Yes ? ”
22514	22518	22510	22510	He	83	“ Thank you . ”
22538	22544	22534	22534	himself	83	“ Is this okay now ? ”
22556	22567	22568	22568	I	0	“ It ’s your house . Do whatever you want , ”
22621	22626	22617	22617	Carter	83	“ That smells good . ”
22627	22633	22634	22634	I	0	“ Would you like some ? ”
22637	22649	22634	22634	I	0	“ Yeah . Actually , I think I will have some . ”
22694	22697	22698	22698	I	0	“ What ? ”
22701	22713	22698	22698	I	0	“ Are n’t you going to heat it up for me ? ”
22714	22721	22748	22748	my	0	“ No . Why would I ? ”
22722	22730	22761	22761	his	83	“ You asked if I wanted some . ”
22731	22745	22746	22746	I	0	“ That did n’t mean that I would heat it up for you . ”
22764	22776	22761	22761	his	83	“ This is payback for the coffee , is n’t it ? ”
22777	22788	22789	22789	He	83	“ I have no clue what you ’re talking about . ”
22920	22925	22926	22926	Zoey	97	“ This is beautiful , ”
22929	22937	22926	22926	Zoey	97	“ Welcome to Casa Grayson in Malibu . ”
22941	22955	22938	22938	Nora	97	“ I had one of the rooms down here made up for you , ”
22961	22973	22974	22974	She	97	“ Thanks , big brother . Hey , are you okay ? ”
22980	22985	22974	22974	She	97	“ I ’m fine . ”
22986	22996	22997	22997	she	97	“ I want to go down to the beach , ”
23000	23003	23004	23004	I	0	“ Now ? ”
23007	23016	23004	23004	I	0	“ I think we should get settled first . ”
23017	23023	23024	23024	Zoey	97	“ I ’ll take her . ”
23027	23039	23040	23040	I	0	“ Fine . Maybe I ’ll come down in a while , ”
23086	23098	23080	23080	I	0	“ It ’s a beautiful day to spend on the beach . ”
23109	23118	23102	23102	her	559	“ Is that what we ’re doing today ? ”
23127	23135	23136	23136	she	559	“ Do you have a better idea ? ”
23139	23145	23136	23136	she	559	“ I think I might . ”
23157	23162	23163	23163	She	559	“ Is that so ? ”
23166	23183	23163	23163	She	559	“ It is . But it ’s a surprise . So you ’ll have to wait . ”
23184	23203	23217	23217	hers	559	“ Not too long , I hope . Now you have me in suspense . I love surprises . ”
23204	23211	23212	23212	My	0	“ And I love surprising you . ”
23292	23299	23300	23300	I	0	“ Hey , are you okay ? ”
23319	23334	23303	23303	He	83	“ I ’m fine . I thought you were taking Nora to the beach . ”
23335	23366	23303	23303	He	83	“ About that . I need your help . I ca n’t push the wheelchair in the sand and she ’s too weak to walk , even with my help . ”
23367	23376	23377	23377	he	83	“ I ’ll be down in a minute , ”
23384	23389	23377	23377	he	83	“ Yeah . Okay , ”
23431	23444	23445	23445	he	83	“ When you ’re ready to come back up , call me , ”
23450	23456	23457	23457	She	97	“ Thank you , Carter . ”
23465	23475	23457	23457	She	97	“ You do n’t want to stay with us ? ”
23476	23483	23457	23457	She	97	“ No . I ’m sorry . ”
23512	23527	23528	23528	Nora	97	“ I feel bad for making him come here , but he needed to , ”
23537	23549	23531	23531	she	97	“ What do you mean ? How long has it been ? ”
23550	23567	23531	23531	she	97	“ Five years . He has n’t been back here since Angelique and the baby died . ”
23568	23577	23578	23578	I	0	“ Why did n’t he sell it then ? ”
23584	23665	23578	23578	I	0	“ I would n’t let him . The house is also in my name and I enjoy coming here . I know the memories are very painful for him , but he needs to face his pain and move on . He brought Angelique here to propose to her on this very beach just as the sun was setting . I ’ll never forget that night he called me and told me she said yes . He was so excited . ”
23666	23673	23674	23674	I	0	“ I ’m sure he was , ”
23677	23694	23674	23674	I	0	“ I need to ask you something and I want the truth from you , Zoey . ”
23695	23705	23578	23578	I	0	“ Of course , Nora . What is it ? ”
23706	23728	23729	23729	I	0	“ What did you mean when you told me you had a gift ? That day you asked me about Angelique ? ”
23749	23792	23578	23578	I	0	“ I died when I was five years old , but it was n’t my time , so they sent me back . When I woke up , I had an ability . The ability to see people who have passed on . ”
23793	23801	23578	23578	I	0	“ So you ’ve been to Heaven ? ”
23802	23816	23817	23817	I	0	“ I have , and it ’s the most beautiful and peaceful place . ”
23824	23837	23817	23817	I	0	“ You have nothing to fear , Nora . I promise you . ”
23838	23872	23578	23578	I	0	“ I ’m not afraid . Especially now that you ’re here . You mentioned to me before that Carter ’s energy is very dark . Is that also something you can see ? ”
23873	23897	23578	23578	I	0	“ I can see people ’s auras and his is very black , which makes sense with the way he lives his life . ”
23898	23911	23912	23912	she	574	“ He keeps his emotions and feelings tightly locked up inside him , ”
23915	23949	23912	23912	she	574	“ He wo n’t heal , Zoey , and now with what ’s happening to me , he ’ll be alone and that terrifies me . That is why I need your help . ”
23950	23971	23972	23972	She	574	“ Like I told you before , I can only try and help him if he wants to be helped . ”
23980	24001	23972	23972	She	574	“ If anyone can get through to him , you can . I know it . I can feel it . ”
24017	24026	24027	24027	Carter	83	“ Are you ready to come back inside ? ”
24036	24045	24046	24046	Nora	97	“ Yes . I need to lie down , ”
24079	24092	24093	24093	Carter	83	“ I ’ve opened your window so you can hear the ocean , ”
24096	24118	24119	24119	Carter	83	“ Thank you . If the two of you do n’t mind , I ’m going to go to sleep now . ”
24131	24144	24145	24145	he	83	“ I put your bags in the room next to Nora ’s , ”
24148	24168	24145	24145	he	83	“ There ’s only four bedrooms , two downstairs and two upstairs . Sadie and I will be upstairs . ”
24169	24174	24175	24175	I	0	“ Okay . Thanks , ”
24215	24229	24230	24230	I	0	“ It ’s beautiful here . I can see why you bought it , ”
24233	24247	24230	24230	I	0	“ Yeah , well , it will be going up for sale after — ”
24308	24322	24301	24301	I	0	“ Memories are only bad because of the pain we let ourselves consume . ”
24323	24327	24328	24328	he	83	“ Excuse me ? ”
24331	24334	24328	24328	he	83	“ Nothing . ”
24340	24350	24335	24335	I	0	“ No ! What did you mean by that ? ”
24358	24436	24354	24354	he	83	“ I know how much it hurts you to be in this house and you ’re only here because it ’s Nora ’s dying wish . But it does n’t have to hurt , Mr. Grayson . Memories are a treasure and they were made with love . That ’s what you need to remember . Embrace the memories here . Feel the good times and the love and remember what it ’s like to live again . ”
24488	24501	24502	24502	He	83	“ You do n’t know what the fuck you ’re talking about ! ”
24509	24520	24521	24521	he	83	“ Stay out of my fucking business and my life ! ”
24580	24588	24589	24589	I	0	“ Are you up to eating anything ? ”
24602	24609	24610	24610	she	97	“ I just need some water , ”
24643	24651	24652	24652	she	97	“ It ’s getting harder to swallow , ”
24660	24695	24652	24652	she	97	“ I ’m getting weaker and the headaches are getting worse . I ’ve done all my research and I know what you have to do now . Prepare Carter for it , please . ”
24708	24729	24730	24730	I	0	“ I will , but right now , I need to call the doctor . I ’ll be right back . ”
24793	24820	24821	24821	he	584	“ Sadie made dinner for us and you ca n’t be bothered to sit and eat it ? I thought you were just checking on Nora , ”
24837	24848	24828	24828	he	584	“ I need to talk to you , Mr. Grayson . ”
24849	24860	24861	24861	He	584	“ You can talk to me at the dinner table . ”
24909	24919	24920	24920	he	584	“ What do you need to discuss with me ? ”
24923	24951	24920	24920	he	584	“ I made a call to Dr. Sutton and he will be stopping by in about an hour to examine Nora and bring some supplies for her . ”
24952	24955	24894	24894	I	0	“ Why ? ”
24956	25001	24894	24894	I	0	“ She ’s having trouble swallowing and her headaches are getting worse . She ’s going to need to be hooked up to an IV for fluids from here on out and it will be easier to push her meds when she needs them . ”
25002	25022	24920	24920	he	584	“ How the fuck is she supposed to eat ? Are you going to give her a feeding tube ? ”
25023	25055	24894	24894	I	0	“ At this point , a feeding tube will only provide her with liquids her body no longer needs and that can cause her to swell , making her more uncomfortable . ”
25056	25076	25077	25077	he	589	“ So you ’re going to let her starve to death ? Is that what you ’re telling me ? ”
25080	25153	25077	25077	he	589	“ Mr. Grayson , her body no longer needs the nutrition and she has no appetite . You ’ve witnessed how she ’s been eating the past couple of weeks . I ’ll have Sadie make her some cream of wheat if she wants food , but to be honest , she ’s not going to want anything . Now we just have to try and make her as comfortable as possible . ”
25200	25238	25188	25188	Sadie	71	“ Do n’t , Zoey . Let him be for a while . If you go out there now , you ’ll only make it worse . He needs time to process what you just told him . ”
25239	25244	25245	25245	I	0	“ You ’re right . ”
25353	25358	25359	25359	I	0	“ Where ’s Zoey ? ”
25363	25373	25374	25374	she	71	“ She and the doctor are in with Nora , ”
25406	25413	25414	25415	the doctor	350	“ You must be Mr. Grayson , ”
25418	25443	25414	25415	the doctor	350	“ Nora is resting comfortably and Zoey will keep me updated . Do you have any questions ? I know how hard this is . ”
25444	25447	25448	25448	I	0	“ No . ”
25454	25462	25448	25448	I	0	“ I do n’t have any questions . ”
25478	25506	25470	25470	he	350	“ The best thing you can do is not to let her see you fall apart . She ’s weak and you need to be her strength . ”
25571	25593	25594	25594	Sadie	71	“ Excuse me , Mr. Grayson . Is there anything I can get for you before I retire for the night ? ”
25597	25606	25594	25594	Sadie	71	“ Tell Zoey I need to see her . ”
25620	25627	25628	25628	Zoey	97	“ You wanted to see me ? ”
25635	25640	25641	25641	I	0	“ Have a seat . ”
25651	25661	25641	25641	I	0	“ Has Nora discussed any funeral arrangements with you ? ”
25662	25671	25672	25672	I	0	“ No . She has n’t . Why ? ”
25679	25694	25672	25672	I	0	“ She ’s being very secretive about it and I want to know why . ”
25695	25701	25702	25702	she	71	“ What do you mean ? ”
25705	25751	25702	25702	she	71	“ I tried to talk to her about what her wishes were , and she told me that she already has everything arranged , and I will find out the details after her death . Are you sure you do n’t know anything about it ? ”
25752	25770	25672	25672	I	0	“ I ’m positive , Mr. Grayson . She never said a word to me about it . ”
25771	25781	25702	25702	she	71	“ How much longer does she have to suffer ? ”
25782	25790	25702	25702	she	71	“ Possibly a week , maybe two . ”
25791	25797	25798	25798	I	0	“ I need another drink , ”
25813	25826	25801	25801	I	0	“ Drinking is n’t going to make all of this go away , ”
25835	25860	25830	25830	she	97	“ We ’re done talking , Zoey . I asked you a question , I got my answer , and now we ’re done . ”
26010	26015	26003	26003	Zoey	97	“ What is it ? ”
26016	26023	26024	26024	she	97	“ Nora is asking for you , ”
26062	26065	26066	26066	I	0	“ Hey . ”
26069	26075	26066	26066	I	0	“ I ’m here now . ”
26088	26101	26085	26085	her	97	“ You ’re going to be okay , Carter . Promise me . ”
26124	26130	26131	26131	I	0	“ I ’ll be fine . ”
26137	26147	26131	26131	I	0	“ I do n’t want you worrying about me . ”
26148	26179	26180	26180	she	97	“ Growing up , you always worried about me . So now , it ’s my turn to worry about you . You ’re my brother and I love you , ”
26189	26197	26180	26180	she	97	“ I love you too , Nora . ”
26203	26206	26207	26207	she	97	“ Zoey ? ”
26211	26217	26221	26221	she	97	“ I ’m right here , ”
26234	26247	26221	26221	she	97	“ They ’re here . I can see them . Can you ? ”
26255	26263	26251	26251	she	97	“ Yes . I can see them . ”
26438	26445	26446	26446	Carter	83	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
26458	26470	26449	26449	he	83	“ I had to call Dr. Sutton and Nora ’s attorney . ”
26471	26476	26477	26477	he	83	“ Why her attorney ? ”
26480	26498	26477	26477	he	83	“ I do n’t know . Nora gave me specific instructions to call him immediately after she — ”
26503	26522	26499	26499	I	0	“ Someone will be here soon to take her body , so if you need some more time … ”
26523	26583	26449	26449	he	83	“ I ’m fine . Sadie is in there now . I have no fucking clue what I ’m supposed to do . She told me that everything for her funeral was taken care of and I did n’t have to worry about a thing . So now what ? How the fuck do I know what to do ? ”
26584	26618	26499	26499	I	0	“ All I know is her attorney is on the next flight out of New York . He ’ll be here tonight . I ’m sure she made all the arrangements with him . ”
26619	26641	26449	26449	he	83	“ This does n’t make any sense to me . Why would n’t she tell me and let me handle it ? ”
26642	26681	26682	26682	He	615	“ I have no clue , Mr. Grayson . I wish I had some answers for you , but she never discussed her arrangements with me . So , we ’ll have to wait until he gets here . ”
26791	26800	26801	26801	I	0	“ Have you seen Mr. Grayson , Sadie ? ”
26804	26811	26812	26812	she	97	“ No . I have n’t , ”
26938	26944	26924	26926	two tall gentlemen	626	“ Can I help you ? ”
26945	26964	26976	26976	Nora	97	“ We ’re from Kingsley Funeral Home and we ’re here to collect the body of Nora Grayson . ”
26965	26971	26972	26972	I	0	“ Please , come in . ”
26996	27003	27004	27004	He	83	“ Excuse me , Mr. Grayson ? ”
27011	27028	27004	27004	He	83	“ The funeral home is here to pick up Nora . I thought you should know . ”
27029	27034	27035	27035	he	83	“ What funeral home ? ”
27038	27041	27042	27042	I	0	“ Kingsley , ”
27058	27074	27045	27045	He	83	“ Excuse me , but who called you to pick up my sister ’s body ? ”
27075	27082	27004	27004	He	83	“ A man named Mr. Gainsley . ”
27083	27105	27045	27045	He	83	“ And what are you going to do with her body ? She needs to be flown back to New York . ”
27106	27142	27045	27045	He	83	“ I ’m sorry , but I do n’t know . The only thing we were told was that we needed to pick up the body and further instructions will be given to us tomorrow . ”
27143	27147	27148	27148	He	83	“ Damn it . ”
27189	27212	27213	27213	He	83	“ Mr. Grayson , let ’s go into the kitchen and let them do their job . I ’ve made some coffee . ”
27228	27241	27242	27242	he	83	“ Coffee ? You really think I want fucking coffee right now ? ”
27277	27284	27285	27285	He	83	“ This is what I want . ”
27291	27299	27285	27285	He	83	“ Not a fucking cup of coffee . ”
27351	27362	27336	27336	I	0	“ You do n’t need to do that , Sadie . ”
27363	27375	27376	27381	The men from the funeral home	635	“ I do , Zoey . I need to keep busy . ”
27394	27401	27402	27402	Carter	83	“ Let me ask you something , ”
27409	27428	27402	27402	Carter	83	“ What did Nora mean when she said ‘ they ’ were here ? Who did she see ? ”
27452	27464	27465	27465	he	83	“ I asked you a question and I expect an answer , ”
27472	27476	27465	27465	he	83	“ Your parents . ”
27486	27499	27477	27477	He	83	“ And you expect me to believe that ? She was delirious . ”
27500	27523	27465	27465	he	83	“ I do n’t expect you to believe anything , Mr. Grayson . You asked me a question and I answered it . ”
27524	27530	27531	27531	He	83	“ You ’re fucking nuts . ”
27536	27555	27531	27531	He	83	“ You may take good care of dying patients , but you ’re not right in the head . ”
27567	27586	27587	27587	Sadie	71	“ Do n’t listen to him , Zoey . He is n’t aware of what he ’s saying , ”
27590	27597	27587	27587	Sadie	71	“ I know he does n’t . ”
27638	27641	27642	27642	I	0	“ Hello , ”
27645	27679	27642	27642	I	0	“ Miss Benson , it ’s Brian Gainsley . I just landed and I ’m going to get a hotel room for the night . I ’ll be by tomorrow say around ten ? ”
27680	27690	27731	27731	he	83	“ Ten o’clock will be fine , Mr. Gainsley . ”
27691	27696	27697	27697	he	113	“ See you then , ”
27793	27797	27798	27798	I	0	“ Mr. Grayson . ”
27850	27864	27839	27839	I	0	“ Come on , Carter , you have to help me out here . ”
27871	27898	27899	27899	I	0	“ As much as I want to leave your dumb drunk ass out here all night , Nora would never forgive me . So come on ! ”
27914	27923	27924	27924	he	83	“ I ca n’t believe she ’s gone , ”
27927	27944	27924	27924	he	83	“ I know . We can talk about this later , after you ’ve sobered up . ”
28059	28067	28068	28068	I	0	“ What the fuck are you doing ? ”
28079	28114	28071	28071	I	0	“ Nora ’s attorney will be here in an hour and you reek like alcohol . Get yourself up , get in the shower , and get dressed . I brought you some coffee . ”
28115	28125	28126	28126	I	0	“ Why did n’t you wake me up sooner ? ”
28129	28139	28140	28140	I	0	“ I tried . You would n’t wake up . ”
28155	28170	28140	28140	I	0	“ Why am I on the couch ? I thought I was in bed . ”
28171	28206	28140	28140	I	0	“ I found you passed out on the beach last night and I could only manage to drag you this far . You ’re lucky I did n’t leave you out there all night . ”
28207	28216	28217	28217	I	0	“ You did n’t have to do that . ”
28226	28246	28217	28217	I	0	“ I know I did n’t have to , but I was n’t going to let you embarrass yourself . ”
28262	28272	28247	28247	I	0	“ I better go shower before he gets here . ”
28447	28460	28442	28443	Brian Gainsley	114	“ Hello , Carter . I ’m so sorry for your loss . ”
28461	28470	28436	28436	I	0	“ Thanks , Brian . Come on in . ”
28471	28478	28479	28479	He	114	“ You must be Miss Benson . ”
28488	28501	28482	28482	he	114	“ It ’s Zoey . Nice to meet you , Mr. Gainsley . ”
28502	28513	28514	28514	I	0	“ I suppose we should go into the dining room , ”
28517	28532	28514	28514	I	0	“ May I get you anything , Brian ? Coffee ? A drink perhaps ? ”
28533	28538	28539	28539	He	114	“ No thank you . ”
28559	28582	28583	28583	He	114	“ I have Nora ’s wishes , so to speak . I was instructed to deliver these wishes immediately following her death . ”
28599	28696	28596	28596	his	114	“ I , Nora Grayson , give to you the following that are my wishes and are to be honored upon my death . I will be cremated and my ashes will be scattered in the following places : Lake Tahoe , Grand Canyon , in the waters of Puget Sound , and my remaining ashes shall be scattered near Sweetheart Rock on the Hawaiian Island of Lanai . The scattering is to be done by two people : my brother Carter Grayson and my hospice nurse Zoey Benson in the exact order as stated above . ”
28697	28701	28702	28702	I	0	“ What ? ! ”
28705	28714	28702	28702	I	0	“ You have got to be kidding me . ”
28715	28722	28723	28723	Brian	114	“ Shall I continue , Carter ? ”
28742	28915	28730	28730	I	0	“ Upon the completion of my wishes , Zoey will receive a check for services rendered and Carter will receive the signed papers handing over my shares of Grayson Enterprises to him . Both Carter and Zoey will travel by car to distribute my ashes with the exception of Hawaii . Since Lanai will be the last place visited and not many ashes will be left , the remaining amount can be stored in a small Ziploc baggie and tucked away in between layers of clothing either in a carry - on or suitcase . Take note that when you scatter my ashes in Lake Tahoe , it must be done on the south side ( Nevada ) , since it is prohibited in California . When you get back home to New York , please have a celebration lunch or dinner for me . Celebrate the fact that I am healthy once again and no longer in pain . No tears shall be shed and life will go on as usual . ”
28916	28929	28930	28930	Brian	114	“ Well , that ’s it . Those are Nora ’s wishes , ”
28933	28986	28930	28930	Brian	114	“ I ’ve already been in contact with the funeral home and they will be cremating her today and you may pick up her ashes tomorrow . She was very prepared for this , Carter . Now it ’s up to you and Miss Benson to see that her wishes are fulfilled . ”
28987	28997	28998	28998	I	0	“ She certainly was prepared , was n’t she ? ”
29001	29022	28998	28998	I	0	“ If you do n’t have any further questions , I have a plane to catch back to New York . ”
29023	29026	29027	29027	I	0	“ No . ”
29032	29036	29027	29027	I	0	“ No questions . ”
29037	29054	29055	29055	I	0	“ Again , I ’m so sorry for your loss . She was a wonderful girl . ”
29082	29090	29091	29091	I	0	“ What the hell was she thinking ? ”
29094	29100	29091	29091	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
29101	29104	29105	29105	I	0	“ Listen , ”
29114	29133	29108	29108	I	0	“ I can do this alone . I ’ll write you a check and you can go home . ”
29134	29190	29201	29201	she	97	“ To be honest with you , Mr. Grayson , the last thing I want to do is to be stuck in a car with you traveling from state to state , but I respected Nora a great deal , and if this is what she wanted , then I will do as she asked . ”
29216	29234	29201	29201	she	97	“ Fine . Then we ’ll head to Lake Tahoe tomorrow after we leave the funeral home . ”
29235	29239	29240	29240	she	97	“ In what ? ”
29243	29259	29240	29240	she	97	“ I guess I ’ll have to rent us a car , wo n’t I ? ”
29492	29504	29505	29505	Carter	83	“ I ’ve rented a car for our little road trip , ”
29513	29518	29505	29505	Carter	83	“ You scared me . ”
29530	29540	29519	29519	I	0	“ Why are you always sneaking up on me ? ”
29541	29563	29505	29505	Carter	83	“ I do n’t sneak up on you . It ’s not my fault that you ’re always in a daze . ”
29564	29569	29505	29505	Carter	83	“ I am not . ”
29570	29635	29519	29519	I	0	“ Yes , you are . But I ’m not going to stand here and argue with you . Sadie ’s flight back to New York leaves tomorrow morning at ten o’clock and the car service is picking her up at eight . As soon as she leaves , we ’ll head to the funeral home and be on our way to Lake Tahoe . ”
29649	29656	29657	29657	He	83	“ I have to take this . ”
29687	29700	29683	29683	Carter	83	“ As of tomorrow , this house will be on the market . ”
29701	29706	29707	29707	I	0	“ That was quick , ”
29710	29716	29717	29717	He	83	“ The quicker the better . ”
29730	29745	29717	29717	He	83	“ But why ? You bought this house for a reason at one time . ”
29783	29796	29772	29772	Carter	83	“ Me selling this house is none of your concern , Zoey . ”
29797	29827	29777	29777	his	83	“ You ’re right , Mr. Grayson , it ’s not . But this house meant the world to Nora . She would n’t want you to sell it . ”
29828	29838	29839	29839	He	83	“ Nora is n’t here anymore , is she ? ”
29849	29867	29841	29841	his	83	“ Just because she is n’t physically here does n’t mean she is n’t here in spirit . ”
29868	29906	29777	29777	his	83	“ Jesus Christ , enough with your craziness . Nora is n’t here , this is my house , and I ’ve decided to sell it . There ’s no need for me to keep it anymore . ”
29907	29919	29920	29920	I	0	“ The memories here are enough to want to keep it , ”
29923	29945	29946	29946	He	83	“ Yeah , well , some memories are better forgotten . I ’m going out . I ’ll be back later . ”
29963	29968	29971	29971	her	71	“ I told you so ”
29977	30002	29974	29974	I	0	“ Someone had to say it . He ’s selling this house for all the wrong reasons and one day he will regret it . ”
30003	30019	29974	29974	I	0	“ We know that , Zoey , but he will never see it that way . ”
30280	30294	30295	30295	he	83	“ Sadie will be down in a minute . Are you all packed ? ”
30298	30314	30295	30295	he	83	“ Good morning to you too . My bags are already by the front door . ”
30328	30342	30315	30315	I	0	“ Were you the one responsible for the pillow and blanket last night ? ”
30343	30346	30347	30347	I	0	“ Yes . ”
30376	30379	30380	30380	he	83	“ Thanks , ”
30384	30395	30380	30380	he	83	“ You ’re welcome . Want to talk about it ? ”
30410	30413	30414	30414	he	83	“ No , ”
30436	30443	30444	30444	Carter	83	“ That must be your driver , ”
30457	30465	30449	30449	I	0	“ Thank you for everything , Sadie . ”
30466	30501	30502	30502	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , Zoey . Thank you for everything you did for Nora . Please do n’t be a stranger and come visit . I ’ll miss you and our morning talks . ”
30509	30524	30502	30502	I	0	“ I ’ll miss you too , and I wo n’t be a stranger . ”
30525	30544	30545	30545	she	71	“ Good luck on your road trip . Whatever you do , please do n’t kill Mr. Grayson , ”
30553	30563	30545	30545	she	71	“ I will try my best to control myself . ”
30587	30592	30593	30593	he	83	“ Are you ready ? ”
30597	30604	30593	30593	he	83	“ Is the rental car here ? ”
30605	30615	30622	30622	I	0	“ Yes . It was dropped off last night . ”
30736	30759	30760	30760	he	105	“ I ’m so sorry for your loss . Please step into my office and I will collect your sister ’s ashes , ”
30822	30829	30830	30830	Carter	83	“ Why are there four urns ? ”
30833	30842	30843	30843	Ted	105	“ It was per your sister ’s request , ”
30846	30862	30863	30863	He	105	“ Each urn is for the four places in which you will scatter her ashes . ”
30875	30913	30863	30863	He	105	“ Each urn is equally filled except for this one . This has only a small amount of her ashes in it for your Hawaii trip , which can easily be transferred into this plastic storage bag . ”
30914	30929	30930	30930	Carter	83	“ I am not putting my sister ’s ashes in a plastic storage bag , ”
30933	30957	30930	30930	Carter	83	“ I will be renting a private plane to fly us to Hawaii , so taking the urn wo n’t be an issue . ”
30958	30990	30991	30991	Carter	83	“ Very well , Mr. Grayson . All I need from you is a signature that you ’ve picked up your sister ’s ashes and then we ’ll be done here . ”
31102	31112	31113	31113	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe Nora did all this , ”
31120	31130	31113	31113	I	0	“ Did what ? Make things easy for you ? ”
31146	31187	31143	31143	her	97	“ You think this is easy ? You think I like traveling around with my sister ’s ashes in the back seat ? I do n’t know why the hell she just could n’t be buried next to my parents . ”
31188	31212	31143	31143	her	97	“ She obviously had a reason for wanting her ashes scattered to these various places . They must have some sort of meaning . ”
31213	31226	31143	31143	her	97	“ If they do , I do n’t know anything about it . ”
31227	31241	31242	31242	she	97	“ So do you have a plan or are we just winging it ? ”
31245	31254	31255	31255	I	0	“ Like I had time to plan anything , ”
31258	31283	31255	31255	I	0	“ I guess we ’re just winging it . Can you do me a favor and just be quiet ? I need to think . ”
31284	31304	31316	31316	her	97	“ Maybe you should have started planning yesterday after Mr. Gainsley left instead of going out and getting drunk . ”
31305	31312	31313	31313	I	0	“ Are you serious right now ? ”
31318	31332	31313	31313	I	0	“ What I do is none of your fucking business . Got it ? ”
31340	31347	31333	31333	I	0	“ Got it , Mr. Grayson . ”
31556	31559	31560	31560	I	0	“ Hey , ”
31590	31593	31587	31587	she	97	“ What ? ”
31594	31600	31601	31601	I	0	“ Are you getting hungry ? ”
31604	31612	31601	31601	I	0	“ Yeah . Actually , I am . ”
31613	31645	31654	31654	she	97	“ In another hour , we ’ll be in Lone Pine , which is halfway to Lake Tahoe . We can stop and grab some lunch . Can you hold out ? ”
31646	31650	31651	31651	She	97	“ I can . ”
31746	31760	31761	31761	she	97	“ Whew , I did n’t think I was going to make it , ”
31768	31781	31761	31761	she	97	“ Why did n’t you say something ? We could have stopped . ”
31782	31794	31795	31795	she	97	“ You told me to be quiet so you could think , ”
31807	31845	31798	31798	I	0	“ Listen , Zoey . We ’re going to be spending a lot of time together during this trip , so I think it would be in both our best interests if we tried to get along . ”
31846	31859	31860	31860	Her	97	“ I ’m not the one with the problem , Mr. Grayson . ”
31864	31888	31860	31860	Her	97	“ For fuck sakes . Can you please just stop with your comments ? I ’m trying really hard here to be nice . ”
31889	31902	31903	31903	I	0	“ Then you ’re going to have to try a little harder . ”
31926	31934	31935	31935	she	705	“ What can I get you folks ? ”
31938	31952	31953	31953	Zoey	97	“ I ’ll have the cobb salad with honey mustard dressing , please , ”
31956	31963	31953	31953	Zoey	97	“ And for you , sir ? ”
31964	31974	31991	31991	Zoey	97	“ I ’ll have the turkey club with fries . ”
31975	31987	31988	31988	I	0	“ Okie dokie . I ’ll put that in for you . ”
32028	32081	32016	32016	She	97	“ We should be getting to Lake Tahoe around six o’clock . We ’ll find a hotel , grab some dinner , and scatter Nora ’s ashes tomorrow morning . Then we ’ll get on the road and head to the Grand Canyon , which is about a twelve - hour drive . ”
32082	32085	32023	32023	she	97	“ Okay . ”
32086	32114	32023	32023	she	97	“ I ’m thinking about renting a private jet to fly us from the Grand Canyon to Seattle because it ’s almost a nineteen - hour drive . ”
32115	32131	32016	32016	She	97	“ Nora specifically stated that we were to drive to these places except for Hawaii . ”
32132	32147	32148	32148	I	0	“ Do you really want to be stuck in a car for nineteen hours ? ”
32151	32178	32148	32148	I	0	“ It does n’t bother me . I ’m sure it ’s a beautiful drive . And again , Nora said no planes except to Hawaii . ”
32179	32203	32016	32016	She	97	“ Nora is n’t here anymore and she wo n’t know . The only thing that matters is that we scatter her ashes . ”
32204	32212	32213	32213	Her	707	“ Trust me , she ’ll know . ”
32220	32238	32217	32217	I	0	“ Do n’t start with that again , Zoey . Please . I ’m in no mood . ”
32349	32354	32355	32355	he	83	“ This is bullshit , ”
32364	32375	32355	32355	he	83	“ How can there not be one fucking plane available ? ”
32403	32421	32395	32395	she	97	“ The minute I get back to New York , I ’m buying my own fucking plane . ”
32434	32443	32444	32444	he	83	“ Are n’t you going to say anything ? ”
32458	32509	32447	32447	he	83	“ I ’m sorry you could n’t get a plane and I ’m sorry you have to be stuck with me on this road trip . Once we scatter Nora ’s ashes and get back to New York , you will never have to see me again , Mr. Grayson . ”
32539	32545	32546	32546	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
32549	32702	32546	32546	I	0	“ Before we go any further , I think we need to have a talk . I do n’t feel like I ’m stuck with you , so get that out of your head . I ’m just frustrated . That ’s all . It has nothing to do with you and I do n’t want you to think that I do n’t want you on this trip . I ’ve been through a lot , Zoey , and now that I ’ve lost my sister , it just makes life a hell of a lot worse . You were there for Nora and I appreciate it . It just makes me mad that this is what she wanted and chose not to discuss any of it with me before she died . I visit the cemetery every Sunday , and now she wo n’t be there for me to visit her . ”
32756	32838	32752	32752	he	717	“ Cemeteries are good places , Mr. Grayson , but you need to understand that your loved ones are around you at all times . It ’s only their bodies that are underground and that ’s why people think they need to visit cemeteries . They do it out of respect for their loved ones , but their spirits / souls are around you at all times . You can talk to Nora anytime you want and she ’ll hear you . ”
32839	32853	32854	32854	He	718	“ I do n’t believe in any of that . I ’m sorry . ”
32862	32889	32856	32856	his	718	“ It ’s okay . I ca n’t make you believe anything you do n’t want to . But Nora can hear you wherever you are . ”
32903	32919	32920	32920	he	718	“ Can you do me a favor and look up some hotels in Lake Tahoe ? ”
32923	32926	32920	32920	he	718	“ Sure . ”
32949	32959	32947	32947	Holly	75	“ Hey , how ’s the road trip going ? ”
32960	32997	32927	32927	I	0	“ Not good . He ’s still the same old Carter Grayson . Mean , arrogant , and filled with anger . So far , I ca n’t seem to get through to him about anything . ”
32998	33008	33057	33057	him	722	“ You will eventually . Just hang in there . ”
33009	33014	32947	32947	Holly	75	“ Thanks , Holly . ”
33015	33028	32927	32927	I	0	“ Text me some pictures later when you get to Lake Tahoe . ”
33029	33033	33034	33034	I	0	“ I will . ”
33043	33054	33055	33055	I	0	“ Is there a specific hotel you ’re looking for ? ”
33059	33067	33055	33055	I	0	“ Something that ’s a five star . ”
33068	33086	33087	33087	I	0	“ There ’s a Hyatt Regency Resort , Spa , and Casino that ’s a five star . ”
33104	33116	33117	33117	I	0	“ They only have a one bedroom cottage available for tonight , ”
33120	33129	33130	33130	he	722	“ Of course that ’s all they have , ”
33137	33146	33130	33130	he	722	“ Just hang up and call another hotel . ”
33166	33176	33177	33177	I	0	“ Now what do you want me to do ? ”
33180	33198	33199	33199	he	722	“ I guess we have no choice . Dial the other hotel and hand me your phone , ”
33220	33238	33239	33239	he	722	“ Is this the type of problem we ’re going to run into this whole goddamn trip ? ”
33243	33274	33239	33239	he	722	“ I think the best thing to do when we get to Lake Tahoe , is we should look up hotels for all the other places and book them tonight . ”
33275	33302	33303	33303	he	722	“ We ’re going to have to . Especially in Hawaii . We ’ll be lucky if we do n’t have to sleep on the beach , ”
33306	33348	33303	33303	he	722	“ Well , hopefully , it wo n’t come to that . But I ’m not sure sleeping on a blanket in the sand with the roaring sound of the waves and the smell of the ocean would be so bad . ”
33502	33524	33525	33525	I	0	“ I need to pull off and get gas . You should try to use the restroom while we ’re there , ”
33528	33532	33533	33533	She	727	“ Good idea . ”
33619	33624	33625	33625	I	0	“ Are you hungry ? ”
33636	33647	33648	33648	She	97	“ Just having a little sweet tooth at the moment . ”
33651	33676	33648	33648	She	97	“ Pick out anything you want . It ’s on me . In fact , I think I ’ll grab a couple things myself . ”
33694	33699	33700	33700	I	0	“ You like Snickers ? ”
33708	33718	33700	33700	I	0	“ I do . I guess you do too . ”
33719	33727	33700	33700	I	0	“ It ’s one of my favorites . ”
33728	33732	33733	33733	She	97	“ Mine too . ”
33762	33771	33750	33750	She	97	“ These used to be my mom ’s — ”
33825	33845	33846	33846	I	0	“ How could you possibly remember what your mom ’s favorite candy was if you never knew your mother ? ”
33860	33866	33849	33849	She	97	“ Zoey , answer me . ”
33867	33901	33902	33902	She	97	“ Sometimes I call my dad Scott ‘ Mom . ’ It was hard growing up with two fathers and no mother . Sometimes , the kids at school made fun of me . ”
33931	33942	33943	33943	I	0	“ I see . I ’m sure that was hard , ”
33960	33965	33966	33966	I	0	“ Are you ready ? ”
34106	34111	34112	34112	He	747	“ Good day , Miss. ”
34117	34121	34122	34122	I	0	“ Good day . ”
34138	34147	34129	34129	I	0	“ How may I help you , sir ? ”
34157	34163	34129	34129	I	0	“ Reservation for Carter Grayson . ”
34164	34177	34178	34178	She	748	“ I ’ll just need your driver ’s license and credit card . ”
34181	34193	34178	34178	She	748	“ I see you ’ve rented our one - bedroom cottage . ”
34194	34201	34202	34202	he	83	“ Like I had a choice , ”
34209	34219	34202	34202	he	83	“ It ’s the only thing you had available . ”
34220	34280	34129	34129	I	0	“ I ’m sorry about that , Mr. Grayson . It ’s one of our busiest times of the year . But I can promise you that you ’ll love it . Our cottages are so cozy and the view of the lake is amazing . Plus , you ’re only a couple of steps away from the beach . ”
34281	34296	34297	34299	The cute brunette	749	“ As nice as that sounds , it ’s only a one - bedroom . ”
34307	34341	34342	34342	I	0	“ We are n’t dating or anything . In fact , I do n’t even think we ’re friends , so he ’s uncomfortable with the fact that there ’s only one bed , ”
34353	34356	34357	34359	the cute brunette	749	“ Oh , ”
34362	34369	34357	34359	the cute brunette	749	“ The couch is very comfortable . ”
34370	34379	34380	34380	Carter	83	“ Just give us the keys , please , ”
34385	34427	34380	34380	Carter	83	“ Of course , Mr. Grayson . I ’ll have Miguel , our bellhop , take your bags and show you the way . Your cottage is on the lower level , so it does feature a half bath as well . ”
34428	34436	34437	34437	he	83	“ Wow . It sounds better already , ”
34465	34471	34472	34472	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
34477	34491	34472	34472	I	0	“ His sister just passed away and he ’s having a hard time . ”
34492	34503	34527	34527	him	83	“ I understand . I hope you enjoy your stay . ”
34504	34518	34521	34521	her	749	“ I know I will . Him , I ’m not so sure . ”
34560	34566	34554	34554	Carter	83	“ This is so cute . ”
34574	34580	34570	34570	I	0	“ If you say so , ”
34588	34602	34581	34581	Carter	83	“ Why did you say all that to the girl at the desk ? ”
34603	34653	34570	34570	I	0	“ Because she needed to know why you were being so rude . It ’s not her fault they only had this one - bedroom cottage available . In fact , you should be thankful that we even got this . Anyway , I will take the couch tonight . ”
34654	34684	34581	34581	Carter	83	“ No . I ’ll take the couch . You can have the bed . What kind of man would I be making a woman sleep on the couch ? ”
34720	34743	34716	34716	I	0	“ You paid for the room , Carter . It ’s only right I take the couch and you take the bed . ”
34744	34758	34789	34789	Carter	83	“ This discussion is over . Understand ? I ’m taking the couch . ”
34759	34763	34764	34764	I	0	“ Suit yourself . ”
34770	34778	34764	34764	I	0	“ Wow , look at this view . ”
34805	34833	34797	34797	his	83	“ It ’s nice . I can see why Nora wanted some of her ashes scattered here . Are you hungry ? We can head to dinner . ”
34834	34839	34840	34840	We	756	“ That sounds good . ”
34881	34898	34867	34867	he	83	“ They have a casino downstairs . How about we go check it out after dinner ? ”
34899	34916	34917	34917	I	0	“ I would like that , but how about you call some hotels and make reservations . ”
34920	34933	34917	34917	I	0	“ Shit . I did n’t do that yet , did I ? ”
34946	34978	34934	34934	He	83	“ We can stay inside the park at one of these horrific hotels or stay in Sedona at a nice hotel and then drive a hundred miles to the Grand Canyon . ”
34979	34989	34990	34990	I	0	“ That ’s about an hour and a half , ”
34993	35021	34990	34990	I	0	“ I really do n’t want to drive another hour and a half , scatter her ashes , and then drive nineteen hours to Seattle . Fuck ! ”
35022	35031	35032	35032	I	0	“ I ’ll drive to the Grand Canyon , ”
35063	35068	35069	35069	She	705	“ Enjoy your dinner . ”
35072	35082	35069	35069	She	705	“ May I get you another drink , sir ? ”
35083	35088	35089	35089	Carter	83	“ Yes , please , ”
35092	35114	35115	35115	I	0	“ If we scatter Nora ’s ashes here tomorrow morning around eight , we can be on the road by nine , ”
35118	35126	35115	35115	I	0	“ What ’s your point , Zoey ? ”
35127	35173	35069	35069	She	705	“ By time we get to the Grand Canyon , it ’ll be at least nine p.m. and we ’ll both be exhausted , so we wo n’t have time to think about how crappy the hotel is because we ’ll go right to bed . ”
35174	35201	35115	35115	I	0	“ Crappy hotels equal crappy , uncomfortable beds . If I ’m driving twelve hours , then I want to make sure the bed is comfortable . ”
35202	35215	35216	35216	I	0	“ Okay . Then book a hotel in Sedona and stop complaining , ”
35227	35233	35219	35219	I	0	“ Fine . I will . ”
35239	35251	35234	35234	He	761	“ In fact , maybe we should just stay two nights . ”
35252	35263	35264	35264	His	761	“ What ? Why the hell would we do that ? ”
35268	35338	35339	35339	I	0	“ Because you ’re already going to be tired from driving twelve hours , and then you ’re going to drive another nineteen or even twenty the next day ? I know that I ’ll need a break from the car , at least for a day . I think if we ’re stuck together in the car all that time , we ’ll end up killing each other . ”
35342	35352	35339	35339	I	0	“ No . We ’re only staying one night . ”
35361	35387	35353	35353	He	761	“ And as for the possibility of killing each other , we ’ll make some stops along the way and give each other a break . ”
35388	35412	35422	35422	Carter	83	“ Okay . If you say so . But , it ’s going to take us a lot longer to get to Seattle . ”
35440	35444	35445	35445	he	761	“ Thank God , ”
35448	35454	35445	35445	he	761	“ I like the name . ”
35458	35466	35455	35455	I	0	“ It sounds like a fairytale place . ”
35467	35499	35500	35500	I	0	“ I ’ll only consider it a fairytale place if the bed is comfortable . Which , for the price it ’s costing me for one night , it better be . ”
35522	35533	35534	35534	he	761	“ I think we should head back to the cottage , ”
35537	35542	35534	35534	he	761	“ Forget the casino . ”
35543	35552	35561	35561	Carter	83	“ Good idea . I ’m exhausted anyway . ”
35605	35611	35612	35612	he	761	“ What are you doing ? ”
35615	35662	35612	35612	he	761	“ I ’ve decided that I ’m taking the couch and I do n’t want to hear a word about it . You drove all day and we have a very long drive tomorrow . So I want you to get a good night ’s sleep . ”
35663	35689	35712	35712	He	761	“ I do n’t give a damn what you want , Zoey . I ’m taking the couch . I thought we had an understanding . ”
35690	35711	35712	35712	He	761	“ You thought we had an understanding , Mr. Grayson . I ’m taking the couch . End of discussion . ”
35746	35755	35756	35756	He	761	“ I ’m taking the couch , Zoey . ”
35760	35770	35756	35756	He	761	“ And do n’t take that tone with me . ”
35771	35803	35804	35804	He	761	“ No , you ’re not , and I will take any tone I please . From now on , I will treat you with the same respect you treat me ! ”
35917	35924	35925	35925	he	761	“ I need sex , Zoey , ”
35933	35939	35925	35925	he	761	“ I need it desperately . ”
35940	35943	35944	35944	I	0	“ Okay , ”
35948	35961	35944	35944	I	0	“ It means absolutely nothing . I need you to understand that . ”
35962	35966	35967	35967	His	761	“ I do . ”
36549	36557	36558	36558	I	0	“ Fuck , you feel so good , ”
36677	36682	36686	36686	she	97	“ Are you okay ? ”
36702	36707	36686	36686	she	97	“ I ’m fine . ”
36723	36735	36736	36736	I	0	“ We better get some sleep . Good night , Zoey , ”
36746	36755	36736	36736	I	0	“ Sure . Good night , Mr. Grayson . ”
36756	36770	36771	36771	She	97	“ Stop with the ‘ Mr. Grayson . ’ Just call me Carter . ”
36964	36993	36956	36962	a boy crying behind the next curtain	780	“ His leg is broken in three places . We ’re going to have to do surgery and put some pins in . Are his parents here yet ? ”

37004	37025	36956	36962	a boy crying behind the next curtain	780	“ Sit tight . We ’re going to get you prepped for surgery as soon as your parents get here . ”
37026	37031	37032	37033	the boy	781	“ But it hurts ! ”
37036	37051	37032	37033	the boy	781	“ I know it does . We ’ll get you something for the pain . ”
37134	37145	37146	37146	I	0	“ You ’re going to be okay . I promise , ”
37156	37163	37149	37149	His	781	“ Where did you come from ? ”
37164	37187	37188	37188	I	0	“ From the other side of the curtain . I know it hurts , but it wo n’t hurt for much longer , ”
37192	37198	37188	37188	I	0	“ What happened to you ? ”
37199	37226	37227	37228	the boy	781	“ I was driving with my best friend Andy and his mom when a truck hit us . Can you try to find my friend Andy ? ”

37274	37290	37269	37269	he	781	“ Tell him to stay cool and not give Miss Harper a hard time anymore . ”
37294	37324	37291	37291	He	781	“ Tell him that he was the best friend I ever had and he ’s going to be okay . I have to go now . Please tell him . ”

37800	37817	37792	37792	I	0	“ It was incredible . Look at this view . All this nature and the mountains . ”
37818	37837	37838	37838	I	0	“ I will admit it ’s pretty . Do you want to talk about your nightmare last night ? ”
37848	37868	37838	37838	I	0	“ No . It was n’t even a nightmare . It was more of a memory from my childhood . ”
37869	37886	37792	37792	I	0	“ It must have been a bad memory to make you react the way you did . ”
37887	37908	37909	37909	She	97	“ It was n’t bad . It was just something I had forgotten about . We need to do that . ”
37922	37925	37926	37926	I	0	“ Why ? ”
37929	37938	37926	37926	I	0	“ So we can scatter Nora ’s ashes . ”
37939	37949	37792	37792	I	0	“ Why ca n’t we scatter them right here ? ”
37950	37953	37954	37954	She	97	“ Really ? ”
37960	38003	38004	38004	I	0	“ Are you just going to stand here and dump them all in one spot and risk them getting blown on shore ? If we take a kayak out far enough , we can scatter them where it ’s nothing but water . ”
38007	38030	38004	38004	I	0	“ We really need to get on the road to Sedona . Have you forgotten how long of a drive it is ? ”
38031	38050	38051	38051	Her	97	“ No , I have n’t . But do you really want to do this half - assed ? ”
38055	38102	38051	38051	Her	97	“ I ’ll go shower and then we can head to the lobby to find out where we can rent one . But we ’re going to need to hurry because it ’s already seven thirty . I want to be on the road by nine . ”

38174	38188	38167	38171	the guy behind the counter	813	“ No . We ’ll only be out there about a half hour . ”
38189	38192	38193	38193	He	813	“ Oh . ”
38211	38221	38207	38207	I	0	“ You do know how to kayak , right ? ”
38222	38229	38207	38207	I	0	“ How hard can it be ? ”
38230	38238	38239	38239	I	0	“ You ’ve never done this before ? ”

38261	38298	38254	38254	I	0	“ You ’ll sit in the front and I ’ll sit in the back . All you have to do is paddle from side to side and we need to do it in unison . Understand ? ”
38299	38305	38306	38306	We	808	“ Okay . No problem . ”
38316	38320	38321	38321	Zoey	97	“ Like this ? ”

38647	38660	38661	38661	Carter	83	“ I think we should head back and get on the road , ”
38664	38670	38661	38661	Carter	83	“ Sounds like a plan . ”
38731	38736	38737	38737	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
38750	38778	38740	38740	He	83	“ I do n’t know . I just have this weird feeling that maybe we should go back inside the hotel and eat breakfast before we leave . ”
38779	38788	38789	38789	I	0	“ We ’re already a half hour behind , ”
38792	38801	38789	38789	I	0	“ I ’m aware of that , Zoey . ”
38802	38812	38813	38813	We	819	“ Then let ’s go . I ’m starving . ”
38827	38832	38833	38833	Carter	83	“ Table for two , ”
39034	39037	39038	39038	I	0	“ What ? ”
39041	39066	39038	39038	I	0	“ I ’m just wondering how you ’re doing , that ’s all . I know it ’s hard to scatter Nora ’s ashes . ”
39067	39082	39027	39027	her	97	“ I ’m doing fine . I really have no choice . Do I ? ”
39083	39092	39027	39027	her	97	“ If you want to talk about it — ”
39093	39133	39134	39134	I	0	“ Dammit , Zoey . I do n’t want to talk about it . Why the fuck are you always trying to get me to open up ? It ’s not who I am , so leave it alone , ”

39256	39269	39253	39253	I	0	“ I see sirens up ahead . It looks like an accident . ”
39270	39273	39274	39274	I	0	“ Great . ”
39280	39298	39276	39276	my	0	“ Just fucking great . At this rate , we ’re never going to get to Sedona . ”
39334	39344	39320	39320	Zoey	97	“ Excuse me . When did this accident happen ? ”
39345	39351	39352	39353	the officer	836	“ About an hour ago , ”
39356	39360	39361	39361	She	97	“ Thank you . ”
39367	39379	39380	39380	I	0	“ Why did you want to know when the accident happened ? ”
39384	39404	39380	39380	I	0	“ Remember that weird feeling you had , so we ended up going back into the hotel for breakfast ? ”
39405	39408	39363	39363	her	97	“ Yeah ? ”
39409	39417	39363	39363	her	97	“ Describe it for me , please . ”

39427	39445	39422	39422	I	0	“ Describe that feeling you had , because you were so adamant about getting on the road . ”

39456	39475	39453	39453	I	0	“ I was hungry and I figured you were too . What exactly are you trying to say ? ”
39476	39480	39481	39481	She	97	“ Nothing really . ”
39484	39524	39481	39481	She	97	“ You had a weird feeling so we stayed back , and because we stayed back , we were n’t involved in the accident that probably happened at the precise time we were going to be on that road . ”
39525	39549	39453	39453	I	0	“ So you ’re saying if we did n’t stay and eat breakfast , we would have been the ones in the accident ? ”
39550	39564	39565	39565	I	0	“ Yes . That ’s exactly what I ’m saying . Fate intervened . ”
39575	39627	39628	39628	I	0	“ There you go again , talking all that nonsense . I do n’t believe in fate and I do n’t believe in intuition . I ’m going to ask you one last time , Zoey , just stop with all the bullshit because it ’s really getting on my nerves , ”
39665	39673	39674	39674	she	837	“ Can you pull over , please ? ”
39677	39680	39674	39674	she	837	“ Why ? ”
39687	39694	39695	39695	she	837	“ Just pull over , Carter , ”
39719	39727	39728	39728	I	0	“ What the fuck are you doing ? ”

39799	39838	39839	39839	She	837	“ What ? We ’re in the middle of the highway . You ca n’t have space for a few minutes ! Get back in the car . You ’re setting us more behind than we already are ! ”
39853	39860	39861	39861	I	0	“ Fine ! You want space . ”

39943	39964	39965	39965	she	837	“ I think it ’s best if neither one of us speaks to each other the rest of the trip , ”
39968	39979	39965	39965	she	837	“ I agree , but that will be totally impossible . ”
39980	39985	39986	39986	She	837	“ Nothing is impossible . ”

40091	40106	40081	40083	an older woman	846	“ Are you a paying customer ? Our bathrooms are for paying customers only . ”
40126	40131	40132	40132	I	0	“ Will this do ? ”
40135	40142	40132	40132	I	0	“ That will do just fine . ”
40172	40190	40191	40191	I	0	“ Did you see the woman I walked in with come out of the ladies ’ room ? ”

40251	40259	40260	40260	I	0	“ Those were some really expensive cookies . ”
40275	40280	40281	40281	I	0	“ Are they good ? ”
40284	40287	40288	40288	she	849	“ Yep , ”
40291	40297	40288	40288	she	849	“ May I have one ? ”
40431	40479	40480	40480	He	852	“ I think we should stop , grab some dinner , and walk around for a bit . My legs are starting to cramp up . It ’s only a four - and - a - half - hour drive to Sedona from here . Sound good ? ”
40485	40488	40480	40480	He	852	“ Sure , ”
40504	40519	40520	40520	he	852	“ There ’s a restaurant in here called Fix . They have amazing food , ”
40563	40571	40572	40572	Carter	83	“ Have you ever been to Vegas ? ”
40575	40596	40572	40572	Carter	83	“ No . This place is really crowded . Are you sure we ’ll be able to get a table ? ”
40597	40604	40605	40605	He	852	“ We ’ll get a table . ”

40989	41026	40986	40986	he	852	“ I think you are a mean , arrogant , and miserable man . You ’re rude , condescending , and just an overall jerk . You ’re very disrespectful and I do n’t appreciate it . ”
41047	41077	41078	41078	he	852	“ Okay . I think you ’re crazy and you think I ’m a total disrespectful asshole . Now that we understand each other , we can move forward , ”

42112	42163	42106	42106	I	0	“ I ’m not going to explain it , Carter , and you wo n’t understand . All you ’ll do is call me crazy and start yelling and I ’m in no mood for it . I ’ll drive the rest of the way in a couple of hours . ”
42191	42206	42178	42178	she	888	“ I ’m sorry for calling you crazy , Zoey . It ’s just — ”
42207	42296	42297	42297	she	891	“ It ’s just you , Carter , feeling sorry for yourself because of the tragedies you experienced . You became a victim of circumstance and you locked yourself up in your own little world that consists of nothing but pain and anger . You refuse to see any type of good in anyone or anything . So , if you do n’t mind , I do n’t want to talk about what I see all the time , every day , and every minute of my life , ”
42302	42346	42297	42297	she	891	“ You are n’t the only person in the world who has lost the people you love . You are n’t the only one whose life was affected by tragedy . You just chose to deal with it in a really shitty way . ”
42373	42382	42383	42383	I	0	“ And who the fuck have you lost ? ”
42388	42424	42383	42383	I	0	“ Because from what I can see , you have a perfect little life . You seem content being surrounded by death and sadness all the time . So yeah , you ’re fucking crazy ! ”
42487	42491	42492	42492	she	891	“ Do n’t , ”
42495	42500	42492	42492	she	891	“ Just do n’t . ”
42501	42518	42519	42519	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . I know you do n’t believe me , but I am . ”
42581	42588	42589	42589	I	0	“ Zoey , we ’re here , ”
42628	42634	42635	42640	the older gentleman behind the desk	899	“ Can I help you ? ”
42643	42649	42635	42640	the older gentleman behind the desk	899	“ Reservation for Carter Grayson . ”
42650	42664	42635	42640	the older gentleman behind the desk	899	“ Ah yes , Mr. Grayson . We ’re happy you ’ve arrived . ”
42665	42676	42677	42677	I	0	“ Thank you . It ’s been a long drive . ”
42680	42700	42677	42677	I	0	“ Your two - bedroom suite is ready and I can call someone to help you with your bags . ”
42701	42712	42635	42640	the older gentleman behind the desk	899	“ No need . We can take them up ourselves . ”
42713	42724	42725	42725	He	899	“ Very well . You will be in suite 325 . ”
42750	42760	42761	42761	I	0	“ I ’m exhausted . You must be too , ”
42807	42815	42816	42816	I	0	“ I believe we ’re this way . ”
43040	43047	43048	43048	Carter	107	“ Wow , this is beautiful , ”
43107	43120	43121	43121	Carter	107	“ You can have the room with the king - size bed , ”
43127	43147	43121	43121	Carter	107	“ No . This is fine . Now if you ’ll excuse me , I ’m going to bed . ”
43205	43215	43216	43216	I	0	“ I do n’t know what else to do , ”
43460	43463	43464	43464	he	107	“ Morning , ”
43477	43485	43467	43467	he	107	“ I thought you were still asleep . ”
43486	43507	43467	43467	he	107	“ Nah . I was up at the crack of dawn , so I decided to go for a run . ”
43508	43513	43514	43514	I	0	“ How was it ? ”
43539	43557	43523	43523	He	107	“ Good . It ’s beautiful here . I would have asked you to come , but — ”
43558	43566	43567	43567	I	0	“ I would n’t have gone anyway , ”
43571	43580	43567	43567	I	0	“ You could n’t have gotten much sleep . ”
43581	43594	43595	43595	He	107	“ I did n’t . The bed was a little too comfortable . ”
43598	43625	43595	43595	He	107	“ Go figure . Anyway , I brought you something back . It ’s inside on the counter . Maybe you should go take a look . ”
43659	43665	43666	43666	I	0	“ What ’s in here ? ”
43670	43678	43666	43666	I	0	“ Open the lid and find out . ”
43712	43716	43748	43748	him	107	“ I ’m sorry ”
43723	43744	43745	43745	I	0	“ I do n’t think I ’d ever seen a donut this big before . Where did you get this ? ”
43756	43782	43745	43745	I	0	“ The bakery in the hotel had them . I remember you telling Nora that your favorite donuts were the ones with the white frosting . ”
43783	43794	43795	43795	I	0	“ And you had them put this writing on it ? ”
43798	43830	43795	43795	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’m sorry for what I said to you yesterday , Zoey . I was out of line . There are just some things you do n’t understand . ”
43831	43862	43745	43745	I	0	“ I know you do n’t believe me , Carter , but I do understand . In fact , I ’m probably the only person in the world who does . ”
43863	43871	43872	43872	he	918	“ There ’s no way you could , ”
43875	43908	43909	43909	He	918	“ We have a long trip ahead of us still and I do n’t want there to be any tension . So , I ’m extending an olive branch , or donut . ”
43920	43940	43912	43912	I	0	“ Okay . I accept your apology . How about we cut this donut in half and eat it ? ”
43941	43947	43948	43948	He	918	“ Sounds good to me . ”
43963	43970	43971	43971	He	918	“ Shall I do the honor ? ”
43977	43982	43971	43971	He	918	“ Be my guest . ”
44212	44236	44247	44247	she	920	“ I do n’t want to talk about what I see all the time , every day , and every minute of my life ”
44314	44328	44329	44329	she	97	“ What time do you want to head out for the Grand Canyon ? ”
44342	44347	44348	44348	I	0	“ After I shower , ”
44361	44371	44348	44348	I	0	“ I have a question for you , Zoey . ”
44372	44379	44380	44380	she	97	“ Sure . What is it ? ”
44391	44426	44383	44383	she	97	“ Right before Nora passed away , you told her you could see my parents like she said she did . Was that really true or were you just saying that for her sake ? ”
44452	44477	44441	44441	I	0	“ It ’s okay . You can tell me the truth and I promise not to judge you or say anything out of line . ”
44478	44499	44500	44500	She	97	“ As much as I want to believe you , Carter , I ’m not going to answer your question . ”
44515	44520	44502	44502	her	97	“ And why not ? ”
44528	44539	44521	44521	I	0	“ Because you are n’t ready to hear the truth . ”
44540	44553	44554	44554	I	0	“ Who are you to decide if I ’m ready or not ? ”
44559	44581	44554	44554	I	0	“ You already think I ’m crazy as it is . I ’m not about to add anything else to that . ”
44636	44645	44646	44646	I	0	“ Are you on any kind of medication ? ”
44660	44670	44650	44650	Her	97	“ Have you ever seen me take any medication ? ”
44671	44692	44650	44650	Her	97	“ No , but I do n’t know if you take something right before you go to bed or not . ”
44693	44703	44654	44654	her	97	“ Mr. Grayson , what exactly are you insinuating ? ”
44704	44720	44721	44721	She	97	“ I know you ’re adopted , so maybe mental illness runs in your family . ”
44734	44770	44771	44771	She	97	“ You think I have a mental illness ? Wow . Okay , we ’re going to settle this once and for all because , honestly , I ’m tired of you and your accusations . ”
44789	45010	45011	45011	She	928	“ I can see dead people , aka , ghosts , spirits , or whatever you want to call them . Plain and simple . I ’m not crazy . They ’re real and I ca n’t help it . So , to answer your question from earlier , yes , I did see your parents standing by Nora ’s bed and she saw them too . And by the way , I see Nora every now and again . She was with us while we were scattering her ashes in Lake Tahoe . And the man at the hotel , yes , he was standing behind me because he needed me to give a message to his wife . Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I ’m going to take my crazy ass to the bedroom . Just let me know when you ’re ready to leave . Or , if you ’d prefer , I can catch a plane home and you can handle the rest of this by yourself . I would n’t want you to be freaked out or have to deal with my craziness any more . I know Nora wanted me to help you , but frankly , it ’s not worth it anymore . You ’re beyond help , Mr. Grayson . ”
45023	45052	45053	45053	She	928	“ My parents were killed in a plane crash when I was five years old . So yeah , my life has been affected by tragedies as well . ”
45144	45150	45151	45151	I	0	“ You are a liar ! ”
45156	45194	45195	45195	I	0	“ You lied about your parents and you ’re lying about everything else . Did you just make up that bullshit about them being killed in a plane crash to make yourself feel better from being abandoned ? ”
45198	45217	45195	45195	I	0	“ I ’m calling the airlines and sending you home . I ca n’t deal with you anymore . ”
45276	45291	45273	45273	she	928	“ Year 1997 . New York . Flight 4211 . Kenneth and Margo Anderson . ”
45331	45346	45317	45317	I	0	“ What the hell do you mean no flights are going into New York ? ”
45347	45384	45298	45298	her	928	“ I ’m sorry , sir , but both LaGuardia and JFK have experienced severe power outages and we are n’t sure when it will be restored . Electric crews are telling us maybe sometime tomorrow . ”
45385	45395	45317	45317	I	0	“ You have got to be fucking kidding me . ”
45396	45430	45317	45317	I	0	“ I wish I was , sir . Thousands of passengers are stranded at the moment and a ton of flights have been canceled . My advice would be to check back tomorrow . ”
45431	45435	45317	45317	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
45474	45484	45463	45463	I	0	“ Carter , how are you , my friend ? ”
45485	45495	45317	45317	I	0	“ Hey , Charlie . I need a favor . ”
45496	45505	45317	45317	I	0	“ Sure , man , what ’s up ? ”
45506	45535	45463	45463	I	0	“ Can you see what you can dig up on a plane crash back in 1997 ? Apparently , there was one in New York , Flight 4211 . ”
45536	45555	45317	45317	I	0	“ I think I remember that . Give me a few hours and I ’ll call you back . ”
45556	45561	45463	45463	I	0	“ Thanks , Charlie . ”
45579	45595	45596	45596	she	935	“ Do n’t you know it ’s rude to enter someone ’s room without knocking ? ”
45599	45667	45596	45596	she	935	“ I paid for the room , so technically , I can do whatever the fuck I want . I called the airlines and apparently there are no flights going in or out of New York right now due to some major power outage at both airports . So we better get on the road to the Grand Canyon and I ’ll call again in the morning . ”
45668	45678	45679	45679	She	935	“ I do n’t want to go with you . ”
45684	45733	45734	45734	I	0	“ I do n’t care . You ’re not staying here by yourself . Nora wanted you to come on the trip and since you ’re here and ca n’t go anywhere else , you ’re going to help me scatter her ashes over the fucking Grand Canyon ! ”
45738	45744	45734	45734	I	0	“ So let ’s go ! ”
45760	45782	45754	45754	I	0	“ Really ? Power outages in both airports ? Come on . Why the hell are you doing this to me ? ”
45876	45881	45882	45882	Carter	107	“ What the hell , ”
45885	45901	45882	45882	Carter	107	“ Keep driving to Moran Point . It ’s a few miles down the road . ”
45902	45914	45915	45915	he	107	“ And you think there will be any less people there ? ”
45922	45939	45915	45915	he	107	“ It does n’t matter about the people . It ’s where we have to go . ”
45940	45952	45953	45953	he	107	“ Let me guess , Nora told you to go there ? ”
46043	46055	46056	46056	Carter	107	“ Wow . This is like something out of a painting , ”
46067	46085	46086	46086	I	0	“ It ’s beautiful . No wonder Nora wanted this to be one of her resting places , ”
46122	46129	46130	46130	he	107	“ Rest in peace , Nora , ”
46173	46176	46177	46177	I	0	“ What ? ”
46180	46183	46184	46184	he	107	“ Nothing , ”
46228	46243	46244	46244	Carter	107	“ I think we should grab something to eat and head back to Sedona , ”
46273	46283	46284	46284	he	107	“ Excuse me , I need to take this , ”
46323	46328	46329	46329	I	0	“ Is everything okay ? ”
46332	46340	46341	46341	he	107	“ Yeah . It was just business , ”
46364	46375	46376	46376	he	107	“ Was Nora there with us at the Grand Canyon ? ”
46379	46385	46376	46376	he	107	“ I do n’t know , ”
46389	46446	46386	46386	I	0	“ I swear I felt a hand on my shoulder while we were standing there . You said she was with us in Lake Tahoe . So , if you were telling the truth , then you would have seen her at the Grand Canyon . So , please , Zoey , tell me the truth . ”
46447	46461	46471	46471	him	948	“ I do n’t know , Carter . I did n’t see anyone . ”
46496	46499	46500	46500	He	948	“ Okay . ”
46508	46518	46519	46519	he	948	“ Is there anything you want to talk about ? ”
46522	46525	46519	46519	he	948	“ No . ”
46526	46530	46531	46531	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
46659	46671	46672	46672	He	948	“ I have nothing to say to you , Mr. Grayson . ”
46685	46700	46672	46672	He	948	“ This is because of earlier , is n’t it ? I ’m sorry . ”
46701	46790	46672	46672	He	948	“ You ’re always sorry , but it does n’t change things . You can say you ’re sorry a million times over , yet you continue to say things that hurt me over and over again . You do n’t want me on this trip and I do n’t want to be here . So , tomorrow morning , I ’m calling the airlines and getting a flight back home to Connecticut . I ’ll pick up the rest of my things in a couple of days . ”
46791	46794	46795	46795	He	948	“ Fine . ”
46798	46806	46795	46795	He	948	“ If that ’s what you want . ”
46807	46811	46672	46672	He	948	“ It is . ”
46812	46815	46816	46816	he	948	“ Fine , ”
46842	46874	46875	46875	he	948	“ That call I took earlier at dinner . It was my private investigator , Charlie . I had him do some digging on that plane crash you told me about , ”
46878	46883	46875	46875	he	948	“ Good for you . ”
46887	46945	46884	46884	I	0	“ Everyone on that flight was killed , except for one survivor . A child . A five - year - old girl . But her name was kept out of the papers to protect her identity , and then shortly after the crash , she disappeared . That little girl was you , was n’t it ? ”
46972	46986	46987	46987	He	948	“ Zoey , I ’m so sorry . I ca n’t even imagine . ”
47010	47016	47017	47017	he	948	“ Please talk to me , ”
47024	47052	47017	47017	he	948	“ Yes . I was the little girl who survived the crash of Flight 4211 . The only survivor out of 525 passengers , including my parents . ”
47061	47077	47017	47017	he	948	“ I do n’t know what to say to you except how sorry I am . ”
47078	47089	47090	47090	He	948	“ Do n’t be . That was twenty years ago . ”
47215	47254	47255	47255	he	948	“ I do n’t want you to go home tomorrow . I want you to stay and finish this trip with me . To be honest , I do n’t think I can do it alone . Please , ”
47262	47280	47255	47255	he	948	“ You can do this alone , Carter . In fact , I think you need to . ”
47281	47289	47290	47290	he	948	“ That ’s your decision , then ? ”
47293	47300	47290	47290	he	948	“ Yes . I ’m sorry . ”
47338	47352	47335	47335	he	948	“ I understand and there ’s no need for you to be sorry . ”
47353	47357	47358	47358	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
47793	47800	47801	47803	the valet gentleman	979	“ Excuse me , Mr. Grayson , ”
47806	47817	47801	47803	the valet gentleman	979	“ There seems to be a problem with your vehicle . ”
47818	47824	47801	47803	the valet gentleman	979	“ What kind of problem ? ”
47825	47831	47801	47803	the valet gentleman	979	“ It wo n’t start . ”
47832	47838	47839	47839	I	0	“ You ’re kidding me . ”
47842	47857	47839	47839	I	0	“ I wish I was . We ’re going to try to jumpstart it . ”
47858	47874	47801	47803	the valet gentleman	979	“ Fine . Can you please hurry ? I have to get on the road . ”
47915	47922	47908	47908	She	980	“ Excuse me , Mr. Grayson ? ”
47923	47930	47931	47931	I	0	“ Did you get it started ? ”
47943	47966	47931	47931	I	0	“ Unfortunately , we did n’t . It wo n’t start . You ’re going to need to call a tow truck . ”
47967	47987	47908	47908	She	980	“ Listen , I need to start heading to Seattle . I do n’t have time for this shit . ”
47988	47998	47931	47931	I	0	“ Is there anything we can do for you ? ”
47999	48005	47931	47931	I	0	“ Get me another car ! ”
48006	48042	47908	47908	She	980	“ The nearest rental car place is about an hour from here . I can have someone drive you there , but I would call first to make sure they have a vehicle to rent . ”
48043	48052	48053	48053	I	0	“ I ’ll do that , thank you . ”
48089	48104	48105	48105	I	0	“ How the hell can a rental car company not have a rental car ? ”
48110	48150	48105	48105	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , sir , but this is one of our busiest times of the year . We will have one available in a couple of days if you would like to be put on our list . ”
48151	48161	48162	48162	I	0	“ I do n’t have a couple of days ! ”
48165	48170	48162	48162	I	0	“ Just forget it . ”
48206	48216	48197	48197	I	0	“ Sorry , Nora . I have no choice . ”
48459	48464	48465	48465	I	0	“ What the hell ? ”
48470	48473	48474	48474	I	0	“ Zoey ? ”
48482	48502	48503	48503	she	994	“ Carter ! What are you doing here ? You ’re supposed to be on the road to Seattle , ”
48508	48520	48503	48503	she	994	“ And you are supposed to be back in Connecticut already . ”
48521	48536	48474	48474	I	0	“ My flight keeps getting pushed back because of mechanical issues with the plane . ”
48537	48565	48474	48474	I	0	“ Well , the SUV would n’t start , and when I called the rental car company to rent another vehicle , they did n’t have any . ”
48566	48569	48570	48570	She	994	“ What ? ”
48573	48579	48570	48570	She	994	“ How is that possible ? ”
48580	48615	48474	48474	I	0	“ Apparently , it ’s their busiest time of the year . So I had no choice but to catch a flight to Seattle . It does n’t leave until four forty - five . ”
48616	48626	48474	48474	I	0	“ You ’re stuck here for another four hours ? ”
48627	48642	48570	48570	She	994	“ Apparently , I am . How long are you going to be here ? ”
48643	48673	48474	48474	I	0	“ I have no clue . Last time I checked , the lady was rude and told me that they ’ll keep the passengers updated as they get information . ”
48674	48694	48474	48474	I	0	“ Would you mind if I sat with you ? There does n’t appear to be any open tables . ”
48695	48707	48708	48708	she	995	“ Not at all . Did you order your food yet ? ”
48711	48728	48708	48708	she	995	“ No . I ’m going to do that now . Can I get you anything ? ”
48729	48737	48738	48738	She	995	“ Thanks , but I ’m good . ”
48863	48875	48876	48876	he	107	“ I still ca n’t believe I ran into you here , ”
48887	48892	48893	48893	I	0	“ I believe it . ”
48912	48938	48939	48939	he	107	“ I apologized to Nora in case you ’re wondering . I told her I did n’t have a choice but to fly to Seattle , ”
48942	48953	48939	48939	he	107	“ Oh , I ’m sure she does n’t mind . ”
48954	48980	49029	49030	a woman	1830	“ I was a little shocked when I got your letter this morning . I did n’t think you ’d get such an early flight . ”
48981	49000	49029	49030	a woman	1830	“ It was the only one available . I was lucky because there were only two seats left . ”
49001	49012	49013	49013	He	107	“ Maybe not so lucky since you ’re still here . ”
49016	49026	49013	49013	He	107	“ It ’s been quite a day so far . ”
49039	49078	49029	49030	a woman	1830	“ Attention , passengers . Flight 445 to Connecticut has been cancelled . We will have a flight going out tomorrow morning at seven a.m. Please see the attendant at the desk for further instructions and hotel accommodations . ”
49100	49109	49110	49110	Carter	107	“ Was that your flight they just cancelled ? ”
49113	49120	49110	49110	Carter	107	“ Yep . It sure was . ”
49121	49137	49138	49138	He	107	“ Well , I guess you ’ll just have to fly to Seattle with me . ”
49141	49155	49138	49138	He	107	“ I do n’t know , Carter . We just ca n’t seem — ”
49156	49220	49221	49221	I	0	“ It ’ll be different this time , Zoey . I promise . I really do need you with me for this and I ’m really sorry for everything . When you ’re ready to talk about it , I ’d like to get to know you better , and whatever it is you tell me , I ’m ready to hear it . ”
49254	49265	49266	49266	I	0	“ Okay . I ’ll fly to Seattle with you . ”
49269	49298	49266	49266	I	0	“ Really ? Then we better go get you a ticket . If there are n’t any seats available , then we ’ll find another flight for us . ”
49299	49312	49313	49313	He	107	“ Trust me , Carter . There will be a seat available . ”
49323	49330	49318	49318	he	107	“ You seem confident about that . ”
49331	49335	49336	49336	He	107	“ I am . ”
49350	49357	49358	49360	The young blonde	1003	“ How may I help you ? ”
49363	49398	49358	49360	The young blonde	1003	“ I was supposed to be on the flight to Connecticut that was cancelled . Could you tell me if there are any seats available for the four forty - five flight to Seattle ? ”
49399	49406	49407	49407	She	1003	“ Let me check for you . ”
49415	49428	49429	49429	She	1003	“ We have one seat available and it ’s in first class . ”
49432	49438	49439	49439	Carter	107	“ She ’ll take it , ”
49442	49450	49439	49439	Carter	107	“ And I ’ll pay the difference . ”
49451	49462	49463	49463	She	1003	“ You ’re all set . Have a safe trip . ”
49474	49481	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ What seat are you in ? ”
49485	49487	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ 3C ”
49488	49503	49504	49504	He	107	“ I ’m in 3A , so we ’ll be across from each other . ”
49507	49514	49515	49515	I	0	“ Of course we will be . ”
49518	49528	49515	49515	I	0	“ What did you do about Nora ’s ashes ? ”
49529	49566	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ I had to buy a box at the gift shop in the hotel and transfer the ashes . The airline said it would be fine as long as I kept them in my checked luggage . ”
49567	49581	49515	49515	I	0	“ Good . I ’m glad they did n’t give you any trouble . ”
49582	49603	49604	49604	he	107	“ Would you like to go grab a coffee and sit somewhere until we have to be at our gate ? ”
49607	49617	49604	49604	he	107	“ Sure . Coffee sounds really good right now . ”
49648	49667	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ If you do n’t mind me asking , how did you end up with John and Scott ? ”
49668	49747	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ Scott was the fireman who found me in the plane and he rode with me in the ambulance to the hospital . John was the attending ER doctor who treated me when I was brought in . The press surrounded the hospital for days . John had a good friend who was pretty high up at Child Protective Services and he let him and Scott take me home with them to hide me until it blew over . ”
49748	49762	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ Did n’t you have any other family that could care for you ? ”
49763	49794	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ My mom ’s parents died about a year before I was born and the only living relative my dad had was his father , who was a major alcoholic . ”
49795	49808	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ You were only five . How did you know all that ? ”
49809	49862	49482	49482	Carter	107	“ My mom told me about her parents and John and Scott told me about my grandfather . They had hired a private investigator because they wanted to adopt me . Because of John ’s friend and the pull he had , I officially became Zoey Benson two months after the crash . ”
49863	49884	49885	49885	I	0	“ What I do n’t understand , Zoey , is why the story about being left on the church steps ? ”
49894	49976	49885	49885	I	0	“ Do you realize what would happen if anyone found out that I was the child who survived that plane crash ? About a month after it happened and things were starting to calm down with the press , John and Scott bought a house in Connecticut and we moved there . Even though it was n’t official yet , they introduced me to everyone as their daughter . It was there that we started a new life as a family . ”
49977	50024	50025	50025	I	0	“ I suppose you ’re right . If anyone had caught wind that you were the child who survived , they would have called the press and they would have been all over you . You would never have been able to live a normal life . ”
50028	50036	50025	50025	I	0	“ My life is far from normal . ”
50037	50065	50066	50066	I	0	“ I kind of get that impression . Like I said earlier , when you ’re ready to talk about it , I ’m ready to listen . ”
50075	50084	50069	50069	Carter	107	“ We need to get to our gate . ”
50141	50148	50149	50149	Carter	107	“ Who are you smiling at ? ”
50158	50175	50152	50152	he	107	“ No one . I ’m just happy to finally get out of this damn airport . ”
50176	50182	50183	50183	Carter	107	“ You and me both . ”
50204	50212	50213	50218	the older woman next to him	1013	“ Are the two of you together ? ”
50221	50229	50230	50230	Carter	107	“ Umm . Yes . We are , ”
50233	50244	50245	50245	She	1013	“ Well , then , she can have my seat . ”
50252	50262	50263	50263	I	0	“ Thank you . But this seat is fine , ”
50266	50278	50263	50263	I	0	“ No . No . I do n’t mind at all . ”
50279	50284	50333	50333	Carter	107	“ Are you sure ? ”
50285	50300	50333	50333	Carter	107	“ Positive , honey . A window seat is a window seat , right ? ”
50301	50307	50263	50263	I	0	“ Right . Thank you . ”
50308	50326	50327	50327	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . A lovely couple as yourselves should be sitting next to one another . ”
50340	50353	50354	50354	he	107	“ That was very nice of her to switch seats with you , ”
50357	50365	50354	50354	he	107	“ Our bad day is looking brighter . ”
50366	50374	50375	50375	I	0	“ It is . Is n’t it ? ”
50378	50398	50399	50399	he	107	“ Why do n’t you take a little nap ? Feel free to lay your head on my shoulder , ”
50415	50418	50402	50402	he	107	“ Thanks . ”
50422	50427	50419	50419	I	0	“ Maybe I will . ”
50593	50608	50609	50609	I	0	“ I ’m starving . How about dinner and a little exploring of Seattle ? ”
50612	50626	50609	50609	I	0	“ I like that idea . Just give me a second to change . ”
50643	50651	50652	50652	I	0	“ Are you sure about the wait ? ”
50666	50678	50682	50682	she	704	“ Umm . Let me double check for you , sir . ”
50696	50701	50682	50682	she	704	“ Really , Carter ? ”
50702	50718	50682	50682	she	704	“ What ? I ’m starving and I was n’t about to wait another hour . ”
50719	50727	50682	50682	she	704	“ We could have gone somewhere else . ”
50728	50736	50737	50737	I	0	“ Have you ever been to Seattle ? ”
50740	50743	50737	50737	I	0	“ No . ”
50744	50770	50771	50771	I	0	“ Well , let ’s just say there ’s long waits all over the city . I ’m sure that girl could use fifty bucks . ”
50789	50794	50795	50795	I	0	“ Take my hand , ”
50805	50830	50798	50798	I	0	“ As you can see , it ’s crowded and we ’re going to have to weave our way through the crowds of people . ”
50876	50887	50888	50888	she	704	“ Oh my gosh , look at these beautiful flowers ! ”
50891	50896	50897	50897	I	0	“ You like flowers ? ”
50900	50924	50897	50897	I	0	“ Of course . Who does n’t ? And I just do n’t like them , I love them . Do n’t you ? ”
50930	50940	50941	50941	She	704	“ Yeah . Flowers are nice , I guess . ”
50963	50967	50968	50968	She	704	“ You guess ? ”
50971	51056	51057	51057	she	704	“ Flowers are a symbol of many things . Because of their beauty and delicate nature , they instantly make people happy . They are treasures and symbols of the memories they represent . Each flower has its own meaning , and what most people do n’t understand is when they ’re giving flowers to someone , it ’s important to know the meaning and symbolism behind each flower . For example , red roses mean love , but this purple rose over here , ”
51060	51080	51057	51057	she	704	“ symbolizes a highly spiritual love such as soul mates . So the purple overrules the red in love . ”
51081	51088	51089	51089	I	0	“ I did n’t know that , ”
51092	51145	51089	51089	I	0	“ Most people do n’t . It ’s like when people leave the favorite flowers of their loved ones on their graves . It ’s done as an expression . A way of saying ‘ I know you ’re not here anymore , but I still love you . ’ Make sense ? ”
51146	51157	51203	51203	hers	107	“ I guess . Can we talk about something else ? ”
51158	51164	51089	51089	I	0	“ Yeah . Of course . ”
51267	51270	51271	51271	I	0	“ Hey , ”
51274	51296	51271	51271	I	0	“ Do you by any chance have any bottled water in your mini fridge ? Mine is only stocked with alcohol . ”
51297	51305	51313	51313	I	0	“ Let ’s go take a look . ”
51324	51328	51329	51329	she	1026	“ Thank you , ”
51333	51338	51329	51329	she	1026	“ You ’re welcome . ”
51354	51374	51339	51339	I	0	“ Thank you for agreeing to come with me . I know things between us have n’t been good . ”
51375	51384	51385	51385	She	1026	“ I really did n’t have a choice . ”
52009	52016	52017	52017	I	0	“ Stay in my bed tonight , ”
52025	52030	52031	52031	she	1026	“ Are you sure ? ”
52034	52039	52031	52031	she	1026	“ I ’m positive . ”
52073	52081	52082	52082	she	1026	“ You could have come inside me , ”
52085	52092	52082	52082	she	1026	“ I ’m on birth control . ”
52093	52097	52098	52098	I	0	“ You are ? ”
52103	52106	52098	52098	I	0	“ Yes . ”
52107	52116	52082	52082	she	1026	“ Why did n’t you say something before ? ”
52117	52139	52174	52174	he	107	“ I do n’t know . You reached for a condom , so I thought you felt more comfortable using one . ”
52140	52162	52082	52082	she	1026	“ I ’ve never not used one since Angelique , and I do n’t know why I did n’t this time . ”
52249	52258	52259	52259	he	107	“ I think we should get some sleep , ”
52262	52268	52259	52259	he	107	“ Good night , Zoey . ”
52277	52283	52269	52269	He	107	“ Good night , Carter . ”
52424	52435	52436	52436	I	0	“ You have to make him open up about me , ”
52442	52452	52436	52436	I	0	“ It ’s the only way he ’ll heal . ”
52465	52472	52461	52461	Angelique	98	“ He needs you , Zoey . ”
52478	52486	52490	52490	he	107	“ What are you doing out here ? ”
52496	52510	52490	52490	he	107	“ I could n’t sleep . I hope I did n’t wake you . ”
52511	52529	52530	52530	I	0	“ You did n’t . I woke up and you were gone . Come back to bed . ”
52543	52584	52530	52530	I	0	“ When the plane crashed and I opened my eyes , I was standing in a field of flowers . The sun was so bright I could barely see . But I could feel love and peace all around me . ”
52585	52588	52589	52589	He	107	“ What ? ”
52600	52739	52589	52589	He	107	“ A man and a woman walked over to me and each took my hand . We walked through the field of flowers together . The colors were so vibrant and the smell that filled the air was something I ’d never smelled before . They explained to me that I was special and it was n’t my time to stay with them . They told me that I had a purpose and that purpose was to help those who were dying not to be afraid and tell them of my experience and what I saw . They said that I was n’t to be afraid of what awaited me on the other side and that two nice men were going to raise me and guide me along the way . I was to help those in need . ”
52740	52756	52757	52757	he	1040	“ What did they mean by ‘ what awaited you on the other side ’ ? ”
52760	52831	52757	52757	he	1040	“ After they sent me back and I woke up , Scott was there and picked me up . As he was carrying me off the plane , I watched all the souls of the people who died in the crash walk away , including my parents . But I did n’t feel sad . I smiled and waved to them because I knew the place they were going to . ”
52832	52839	52589	52589	He	107	“ Jesus , Zoey . I — ”
52840	52865	52589	52589	He	107	“ Every day since then , I am able to see the souls of those who passed , and some I have to help . ”
52866	52876	52589	52589	He	107	“ What do you mean you have to help ? ”
52877	52933	52589	52589	He	107	“ Sometimes , I have to give their loved ones a message before they can move on . Like the guy at the hotel . He needed me to tell his wife that everything she needed was locked in the safe in their bedroom and the combination was taped under the drawer of his nightstand . ”
52934	52944	52945	52945	he	1041	“ Have you ever told anyone else about this ? ”
52948	52971	52589	52589	He	107	“ My dads know and my best friend , Holly . I knew I could trust her . We ’re soul sisters . ”
52972	52989	52990	52990	he	1041	“ I do n’t know what to think or what to say about any of it , ”
52997	53015	52990	52990	he	1041	“ You do n’t have to say anything , Carter . I just needed you to listen . ”
53016	53041	53042	53042	I	0	“ I ’m going to head back to bed . I think it would be a good idea if you slept in your room . ”
53058	53069	53070	53070	I	0	“ I will if that ’s what you really want , ”
53074	53082	53070	53070	I	0	“ It is . I ’m sorry . ”
53169	53174	53175	53175	Nora	97	“ Give him time , ”
53185	53199	53178	53178	she	97	“ Eventually , he will accept it and he ’ll see things differently . ”
53277	53306	53307	53307	he	107	“ I knocked on your door and you did n’t answer . I also tried to call you , but I heard your phone ringing in your room , ”
53314	53332	53307	53307	he	107	“ Sorry , I just came down for a cup of coffee . How did you sleep ? ”
53337	53354	53307	53307	he	107	“ How the hell do you think I slept after what you told me last night ? ”
53355	53364	53365	53365	I	0	“ I ’m sure you still have questions , ”
53368	53410	53365	53365	I	0	“ Actually , I do n’t . I ’ve rented a boat and we ’ll be heading out in about an hour . I ’m going back up to my room . I ’ll knock when it ’s time to leave . ”
53544	53550	53551	53551	she	1044	“ Are we leaving now ? ”
53554	53566	53551	53551	she	1044	“ No . There ’s something I need to tell you . ”
53567	53572	53615	53615	Zoey	107	“ What is it ? ”
53573	53591	53592	53592	I	0	“ I ’m going to Hawaii alone , so you ’ll need to book a flight home . ”
53611	53614	53615	53615	Zoey	107	“ Why ? ”
53618	53626	53627	53627	I	0	“ Because I want to be alone ! ”
53631	53692	53693	53693	she	1045	“ Ah , of course you do because that ’s what you ’re good at . You ’re a perfectionist when it comes to pushing people away . If anyone says something you do n’t like or do n’t want to hear , you run the other way . I ’ve seen you do it with Nora and with me ! ”
53698	53752	53693	53693	she	1045	“ You do n’t know what the fuck you ’re talking about . We are n’t good together and we never will be ! Get that through your head ! I ’m not looking for a girlfriend or anyone to connect with . I ’m happy living my life the way I do . ”
53753	53771	53772	53772	she	1045	“ Who said anything about wanting to be your girlfriend ? I ca n’t even stand you ! ”
53790	53808	53809	53809	she	1045	“ The only goddamn fucking reason I ’m here is because they wo n’t let me leave ! ”
53828	53836	53823	53823	I	0	“ Who wo n’t let you leave ? ”
53837	53926	53809	53809	she	1045	“ Nora and Angelique ! You think it was just a coincidence that my plane had mechanical problems and your rental car would n’t start ? You think us meeting in the airport was an accident ? What about LaGuardia and JFK having power outages ? What about my flight getting canceled and there only being one seat left on the flight here ? ! The one directly across from you ! I ’m supposed to finish this trip with you and they ’ll make sure it happens ! ”
53927	53937	53938	53938	I	0	“ And why the fuck would they do that ? ”
53944	53977	53938	53938	I	0	“ Because I ’m supposed to help you ! Damn it , Carter . Open your eyes and your mind . Leave your dark world for a minute and think about this . ”
53978	54005	54006	54006	She	1046	“ You ’re nuts ! You fabricated that whole little story because you needed something to cling to because of the trauma from the plane crash ! ”
54022	54057	54006	54006	She	1046	“ Tell him to stay cool and not give Miss Harper a hard time anymore . Tell him that he was the best friend I ever had and he ’s going to be okay . ”
54068	54075	54076	54076	She	1046	“ What did you just say ? ”
54101	54109	54089	54089	I	0	“ What did you just say ? ! ”
54110	54116	54117	54117	She	1046	“ Let go of me . ”
54133	54141	54142	54142	I	0	“ Not until you answer my question ! ”
54148	54176	54142	54142	I	0	“ Your friend , Andy . You were in an accident with him and his mom . He died and you broke your leg and needed surgery . ”
54177	54186	54230	54230	her	1047	“ How the fuck do you know that ? ”
54187	54218	54219	54219	My	0	“ Because I was the little girl who was on the other side of the curtain . I was the one who spoke those very words to you that day . ”
54308	54391	54392	54392	I	0	“ Angelique told you that she loved you first , in the Empire State Building , about a month after you started seeing each other . You were having dinner and you reached across the table and knocked over her glass of red wine , spilling it all over the beige dress she was wearing . You felt so bad , and as you tried to clean the spots off her dress , she whispered that she loved you in your ear . ”
54400	54454	54392	54392	I	0	“ After she died , you were going through her things and you found the cuff links she had bought you as a gift for your birthday . You wrapped them in a black silk cloth and keep them hidden in a small black box on the top shelf of your bedroom closet . ”
54455	54476	54511	54511	her	1050	“ How the hell do you know that ? I never told anyone about those cufflinks . Not even Nora . ”
54477	54494	54495	54495	She	1050	“ How do you think I know , Carter ? I ’ll leave you alone now . ”
54741	54754	54734	54734	she	71	“ Why are you back already ? And where ’s Mr. Grayson ? ”
54755	54780	54781	54781	I	0	“ Mr. Grayson is still in Seattle or probably on his way to Hawaii . Who the hell knows and who the hell cares , ”
54794	54804	54805	54805	She	71	“ You did n’t kill him , did you ? ”
54808	54847	54805	54805	She	71	“ Unfortunately , no . Not that he did n’t deserve it , though . We got into a huge fight and to be honest , Sadie , I do n’t ever want to see that man again . ”
54848	54864	54805	54805	She	71	“ I ’m sorry , Zoey . I had hoped you would have helped him . ”
54865	54894	54895	54895	I	0	“ He ca n’t be helped . I tried and I did everything I could . You ca n’t save someone who does n’t want to be saved . ”
54941	54989	54929	54929	she	71	“ I ’m sorry , Zoey . He ’s an asshole and you need to forget about him . Put him out of your mind the best you can and go on with your life . You were fine before him and you ’ll be fine now . ”
54990	54994	54995	54995	I	0	“ I know , ”
55043	55046	55047	55047	John	73	“ Sweetheart . ”
55081	55114	55115	55115	Scott	78	“ Why do n’t you go upstairs , take a hot relaxing bath , and climb into bed . I made some homemade chicken noodle soup and I ’ll bring it up , ”
55290	55296	55297	55299	an older gentleman	1075	“ May I help you ? ”
55302	55328	55297	55299	an older gentleman	1075	“ I ’m looking for the woman who was with me . Tall , blonde , beautiful . Have you by any chance seen her ? ”
55329	55339	55361	55364	one of the bellhops	1077	“ I ’m afraid I have n’t , sir . ”
55340	55346	55347	55347	I	0	“ Okay . Thank you . ”
55368	55375	55361	55364	one of the bellhops	1077	“ Excuse me , Mr. Grayson ? ”
55376	55379	55380	55380	I	0	“ Yes . ”
55383	55396	55380	55380	I	0	“ The woman who was with you , Zoey . She left . ”
55397	55405	55361	55364	one of the bellhops	1077	“ What do you mean she left ? ”
55406	55425	55426	55426	I	0	“ I helped her with her suitcase . She got into a cab and headed to the airport . ”
55433	55437	55426	55426	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
55482	55501	55477	55477	I	0	“ Could you tell me if any flights to Connecticut or New York were canceled or delayed today ? ”
55502	55528	55477	55477	I	0	“ All flights are leaving and arriving on time , sir . There have n’t been any cancellations or delays to either of those places . ”
55529	55533	55534	55534	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
55548	55551	55534	55534	I	0	“ Really ? ”
55564	55574	55552	55552	I	0	“ After all this , you let her go ? ”
55588	55665	55575	55575	I	0	“ I know you ’re here , Nora . I ’m sorry . I ’m sorry for everything and I ’m going to make things right with her . I fucked up . I now know why you did what you did . Why you sent us on this trip to scatter your ashes . Why you wanted us together . You saw it and you knew that she was the one who could save me . ”
55683	55782	55666	55666	I	0	“ Maybe I knew it all along too and that ’s why I reacted the way I did . I felt the connection between us from the moment my eyes laid sight on her in Starbucks that day , and that ’s why I freaked out . I had n’t felt that in so long . But do n’t you worry , little sister , I ’m going to fix this . And by the way , you ’re going to have to wait to have your ashes scattered in Hawaii because I ’m not doing it alone . ”
55839	55846	55847	55847	I	0	“ Cliff , what ’s up ? ”
55850	55894	55847	55847	I	0	“ Good news , Carter . There are three offers on your Malibu beach house . Actually , all three clients are fighting over it . One client is offering a quarter million more than you ’re asking . Will you accept it ? ”
55895	55922	55956	55956	I	0	“ No . In fact , take the house off the market . I ’ve changed my mind . I ’m not selling it after all . ”
55923	55928	55847	55847	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
55929	55939	55940	55940	I	0	“ Positive . Give my apologies to the buyers . ”
55959	56044	55956	55956	I	0	“ Did you hear that , Nora ? I ’m not selling the beach house . There are too many good memories there and I ’m not willing to give them up . The memories that we made there and that Angelique and I made were made out of love and I want to keep it and make new memories without forgetting the old ones . That house will stay in the Grayson family and memories will be made there for years to come . ”
56166	56173	56174	56174	she	71	“ Welcome home , Mr. Grayson , ”
56177	56190	56191	56191	I	0	“ Thank you , Sadie . It ’s good to see you . ”
56196	56206	56191	56191	I	0	“ I can take your luggage up for you . ”
56207	56222	56191	56191	I	0	“ No need . I can do it myself . I need your help . ”
56223	56234	56191	56191	I	0	“ Okay . What would you like me to do ? ”
56235	56276	56191	56191	I	0	“ I need you to call Zoey and tell her that she left a couple things here . Tell her they were in the dryer or something . I need her to come here so I can talk to her . ”
56277	56292	56191	56191	I	0	“ Mr. Grayson , she does n’t want to talk to you ever again . ”
56293	56299	56191	56191	I	0	“ Did she say that ? ”
56300	56303	56304	56304	She	1095	“ Yes . ”
56308	56347	56304	56304	She	1095	“ Well , that ’s just too bad because she ’s going to listen to what I have to say . Now , when she comes to collect her things , I ’ll be here waiting for her . ”
56348	56357	56358	56358	Sadie	71	“ But she did n’t leave anything behind , ”
56361	56397	56358	56358	Sadie	71	“ I know , and that does n’t matter . I just need you to get her in this penthouse . I ’ll take it from there . Go ahead , give her a call . ”
56398	56425	56426	56426	I	0	“ But it ’s late and she ’ll wonder why I ’m still here . I think it would be better to wait until the morning . ”
56429	56472	56426	56426	I	0	“ I suppose you ’re right . We do n’t want her to get suspicious . Fine , call her in the morning and let me know when she ’ll be stopping by . I ’m heading to the office first thing . ”
56473	56481	56545	56545	he	1096	“ I will . Is that all ? ”
56482	56492	56545	56545	he	1096	“ Yes . Have a good night , Sadie . ”
56493	56501	56426	56426	I	0	“ You as well , Mr. Grayson . ”
56534	56541	56542	56542	he	1096	“ Here you go , sweetheart , ”
56558	56566	56545	56545	he	1096	“ We ’re happy you ’re home . ”
56583	56605	56606	56606	I	0	“ Do you remember a boy on the other side of the curtain from me that day of the plane crash ? ”
56610	56629	56606	56606	I	0	“ He was in a bad car accident and broke his leg in three places and needed surgery ? ”
56630	56664	56567	56567	John	73	“ Yeah . I think I do remember . He was the boy you were talking to when I came to get you and take you down for x - rays . Why ? ”
56665	56673	56680	56680	his	73	“ That little boy was Carter Grayson . ”
56674	56677	56680	56680	his	73	“ What ? ”
56685	56694	56695	56695	Scott	78	“ How do you know that for sure ? ”
56698	56721	56695	56695	Scott	78	“ It came to me in a dream and I remembered . Now , twenty years later , I met him again . ”
56722	56730	56731	56731	John	73	“ You were supposed to , sweetheart , ”
56734	56810	56731	56731	John	73	“ We all know nothing happens by coincidence . This meeting had been lined up for twenty years . I believe you had to go through some things over the years before you were ready to meet him again and the same for him . The brief encounter in the hospital was just a taste of what the future held . You of all people know that . So do n’t try to deny it . ”
56811	56830	56831	56831	Scott	78	“ I know he hurt you , Zoey . Your first heartbreak at twenty - five years old . ”
56839	56864	56831	56831	Scott	78	“ You never let anyone get really close to you because you knew they were n’t the one you were meant to be with . ”
56865	56890	56833	56833	his	1098	“ I do n’t want to be with a man like him . He ’s horrible , and the things he said to me . ”
56891	56910	56911	56911	John	73	“ Eat your soup and get some rest . You ’ll feel better about things in the morning , ”
56971	56974	56975	56975	she	71	“ Hello , ”
56978	56991	56975	56975	she	71	“ Hi , Sadie , it ’s Zoey . You called earlier ? ”
56992	57005	56925	56925	they	1099	“ Hi , Zoey . You left a couple of things here . ”
57006	57022	56961	56961	I	0	“ I do n’t think so . I double checked before I left the penthouse . ”
57023	57045	56975	56975	she	71	“ I found two of your shirts sitting on top of the dryer . You must have forgotten they were there . ”
57046	57085	56925	56925	they	1099	“ Oh . Okay . I ’ll head into the city tomorrow . There ’s a couple things I need to do . I ’ll call you before I come . He wo n’t be there , right ? ”
57086	57112	56925	56925	they	1099	“ No . He ’s not back from his trip yet . So do n’t worry about that . It ’ll just be me here . ”
57113	57124	56961	56961	I	0	“ Okay . Good . I ’ll call you tomorrow . ”
57125	57132	56925	56925	they	1099	“ See you then , sweetie . ”
57204	57215	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ Hello , Sadie . Did you talk to her ? ”
57216	57223	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ I did , Mr. Grayson . ”
57224	57227	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ And ? ”
57228	57235	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ She ’s stopping by tomorrow . ”
57236	57243	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ Tomorrow ? Why not today ? ”
57244	57260	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ I do n’t know . She said she was coming into the city tomorrow . ”
57261	57265	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ What time ? ”
57266	57277	57278	57278	I	0	“ She said she ’ll call before she stops by . ”
57281	57307	57278	57278	I	0	“ Sadie , I need a time . Call her back . Make it tomorrow around six o’clock . Invite her to dinner or something . ”
57308	57312	57200	57200	Sadie	71	“ Mr. Grayson — ”
57313	57331	57278	57278	I	0	“ Sadie , this is important . Call me back and let me know what she says . ”
57357	57364	57365	57365	I	0	“ I have to answer this , ”
57370	57376	57365	57365	I	0	“ Sure , go ahead . ”
57377	57380	57381	57381	I	0	“ Hello , ”
57384	57425	57381	57381	I	0	“ Zoey , it ’s Sadie . I completely forgot . I have a bunch of errands to run tomorrow and a doctor ’s appointment . Can you come by around six ? I ’ll make us a nice dinner . ”
57426	57467	57365	57365	I	0	“ Yeah . Six will be fine . I ’ll just make the penthouse my last stop before I head home . We can actually meet somewhere for dinner if you ’d like and you can just bring my things . ”
57468	57501	57365	57365	I	0	“ Nope . I ’m cooking for you . It ’s been a while . Plus , it ’ll be quieter here and it ’ll give us a chance to really talk . ”
57502	57517	57381	57381	I	0	“ Okay , but I do n’t want you to go to any trouble . ”
57518	57541	57365	57365	I	0	“ It ’s no trouble at all . I enjoy cooking for you . I ’ll see you around six o’clock tomorrow . ”
57542	57549	57365	57365	I	0	“ See you then , Sadie . ”
57550	57557	57558	57558	Holly	75	“ What was that all about ? ”
57561	57573	57558	57558	Holly	75	“ I ’m having dinner with Sadie tomorrow night at six . ”
57574	57580	57365	57365	I	0	“ At Carter ’s penthouse ? ”
57581	57605	57610	57610	Carter	83	“ Yeah . He ’s still away and Sadie sounds a little down . Plus , I left a couple of things there . ”
57619	57625	57626	57626	I	0	“ What did she say ? ”
57629	57640	57615	57615	Sadie	71	“ She ’s coming for dinner at six o’clock tomorrow . ”
57641	57660	57610	57610	Carter	83	“ Excellent . I knew you could do it , Sadie . Did she sound suspicious or anything ? ”
57661	57668	57610	57610	Carter	83	“ Not that I could tell . ”
57669	57685	57615	57615	Sadie	71	“ Okay . Good . Thanks again . You ’re a doll for doing this . ”
57865	57872	57873	57873	I	0	“ Sadie , I ’m here , ”
57885	57890	57891	57891	Carter	83	“ Hello , Zoey , ”
57919	57926	57927	57927	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? ”
57930	57940	57941	57941	He	83	“ Well , considering this is where I live . ”
57944	57952	57941	57941	He	83	“ Sadie said you were still away . ”
57961	57992	57953	57953	I	0	“ I had Sadie tell you that because I needed to talk to you , and I knew that if you knew I was here , you ’d never come . ”
57993	58013	58014	58014	I	0	“ I have nothing to say to you , and you ’re right , I would n’t have come . ”
58035	58052	58053	58053	he	1109	“ I ’ll never forget the day Angelique told me she was pregnant with my child , ”
58056	58066	58053	58053	he	1109	“ It was the happiest day of my life . ”
58084	58118	58067	58067	I	0	“ I was going to be a father . My life was complete . My business was growing , I had a woman that I loved , and a baby on the way . ”
58144	58233	58142	58142	Carter	83	“ My life was n’t so great growing up . I lost my best friend , Andy , Nora got sick with cancer , my mother passed away , and then my father committed suicide . I had to drop out of college , take care of Nora , and try to save the company from bankruptcy . That company was all Nora and I had left in this world . Then I met Angelique , and suddenly , everything fell into place . I saw my future . ”
58249	58267	58268	58268	He	1112	“ Please , come in and sit down . I ’ll pour us a glass of wine . ”
58329	58439	58317	58317	he	1112	“ The day I got the call about the accident , I was supposed to go to her doctor ’s appointment with her . The plan was that I was going to pick her up from work and we ’d go together . But , I got tied up in a meeting . The client was being difficult and I could n’t leave . So , I sent her a text message and told her that I ’d meet her there . If only I had told that client to fuck off and left the meeting when I was supposed to , she and my son would be alive . ”
58483	58660	58473	58473	I	0	“ It ’s okay , Zoey . You can say it . After their death , I completely shut down . I hated this world , God , and my life . No one , and I mean no one , should ever have to experience so much death . I became angry and nothing mattered to me anymore except my company and Nora , of course . I secluded myself . I did n’t grieve properly because every day I lived , I hoped that it was all a nightmare , and one day I ’d wake up and she and my son would be next to me . I became bitter and secluded myself from everyone and everything . I lost friends because of it . They tried to help , but when they could n’t , they left . Nora did what she could , but I would n’t listen to her . Then , she was diagnosed and the small narrow piece of the ledge I was standing on crumbled under me . ”
58680	58707	58669	58669	My	0	“ I ’m sorry , Zoey . I ’m sorry for everything . For my behavior towards you and every horrible word I spoke to you . ”
58708	58715	58716	58716	I	0	“ It ’s okay , Carter , ”
58719	58958	58716	58716	I	0	“ No . It ’s not okay and I need to explain to you why I did it . The moment I saw you in Starbucks , I felt something . Even though I did n’t know you , I felt this strong connection or pull towards you . But I did n’t think about it because I thought I ’d never see you again . Then that night when you showed up here , I lost it . That ’s why I did n’t want you here . Because I knew you were someone special and different . I resisted and did everything I could to keep my feelings buried . I ’ve seen a lot of women since Angelique died . Actually , I used them and I ’m ashamed of it . But , not one of those women ever touched me the way you have . When you started talking about seeing spirits and heaven and how everything happens for a reason , I forced myself not to believe in any of it because then it would be real and I did n’t want to live in reality . I ’m sorry for calling you crazy . I did n’t mean it . I just wanted to convince myself that you were , even though I knew you were n’t , because then it would be easy for me not to fall for you . ”
58967	58994	58959	58959	He	1117	“ Even when we slept together , the connection was so deep . Deeper than what I had with Angelique and I felt guilty for that . ”
58995	58998	58961	58961	his	1117	“ Carter . ”
58999	59023	58961	58961	his	1117	“ How many times have you seen her ? Please tell me . I want to know everything . I need to know . ”
59024	59072	58959	58959	He	1117	“ Quite a bit . I saw her here , but mostly at the beach house . She was with us the whole time . She ’s here , Carter , because you wo n’t let her go and she ca n’t move on until you do . ”
59073	59077	58961	58961	his	1117	“ And Nora ? ”
59078	59127	58961	58961	his	1117	“ Same thing . All she wants is for you to be okay . She loves you so much and it hurt her to see you living the way you are . Her illness was n’t her focus , you were . You were all she worried about . ”
59128	59149	58959	58959	He	1117	“ Of course she did . She always worried about everyone else . Zoey , have you seen my son ? ”
59163	59174	59157	59157	I	0	“ He looks just like you . He ’s beautiful . ”
59183	59204	59205	59205	he	1118	“ We were meant to meet that day in the hospital . I know now that was n’t a coincidence , ”
59208	59237	59205	59205	he	1118	“ No , it was n’t . And we had to go through everything we did over the past twenty years in order to meet each other again . ”
59238	59253	59157	59157	I	0	“ The man you met a few months ago is n’t who I am . ”
59254	59258	59259	59259	I	0	“ I know . ”
59273	59311	59259	59259	I	0	“ You were right when you told me I became a victim of circumstance . I did n’t know any other way to deal with everything . I felt like I did n’t deserve to be happy . ”
59312	59365	59157	59157	I	0	“ You do deserve to be happy , Carter . Everyone deserves happiness . No matter what . That ’s all Angelique and Nora want for you . They want you to live again and find happiness . Is n’t that what you ’d want for them if the situation was reversed ? ”
59366	59372	59261	59261	my	0	“ Of course I would . ”
59373	59388	59259	59259	I	0	“ Then why would you think they would n’t want the same for you ? ”
59389	59431	59432	59432	He	1119	“ I do n’t know . I was lost , so lost that I could n’t find my way back . But you found me . You , Zoey , and you brought me back . You opened my eyes again . ”
59447	59499	59432	59432	He	1119	“ I know there are n’t enough words in the world for me to say to you . But I will tell you that I miss you and I ’m sorry . I would n’t blame you if you did n’t forgive me . Hell , I would n’t forgive me . ”
59500	59508	59437	59437	his	1119	“ I do forgive you , Carter . ”
59509	59513	59514	59514	He	1119	“ You do ? ”
59524	59527	59514	59514	He	1119	“ Yes . ”
59531	59537	59528	59528	I	0	“ I missed you too . ”
59538	59565	59437	59437	his	1119	“ How did you get home ? I mean , I know you flew home , but I thought Nora and Angelique would have stopped you . ”
59566	59580	59437	59437	his	1119	“ I think they realized you needed some time alone to process everything . ”
59581	59602	59528	59528	I	0	“ I felt Nora in the hotel room when I was talking to her . A coldness rushed through me . ”
59603	59642	59437	59437	his	1119	“ She was there at the Grand Canyon and she did place her hand on your shoulder . I ’m sorry I lied to you about it . I just did n’t want you to get angry again . ”
59643	59673	59437	59437	his	1119	“ I knew she was there . And at times , when I ’m alone at night in my office , I swear I can feel Angelique ’s presence . ”
59674	59687	59437	59437	his	1119	“ That ’s because you did . She was there with you . ”
59716	59723	59724	59724	he	83	“ I have something for you , ”
59727	59731	59724	59724	he	83	“ You do ? ”
59732	59739	59740	59740	He	83	“ I ’ll be right back . ”
59764	59770	59752	59752	he	83	“ These are for you . ”
59792	59797	59798	59798	I	0	“ Star of Bethlehem . ”
59801	59817	59798	59798	I	0	“ Where on earth did you get these ? They ’re very hard to find . ”
59818	59823	59824	59824	He	83	“ It was tricky . ”
59827	59835	59824	59824	He	83	“ Do you know what they symbolize ? ”
59836	59847	59798	59798	I	0	“ They ’re an ‘ I ’m sorry ’ flower . ”
59848	59937	59824	59824	He	83	“ Not only that , but they also represent a redo and ask for a chance to right a wrong . That ’s what I ’m asking you for , Zoey . Give me another chance . Let me make right everything I ’ve done wrong . When I told you back in Seattle that we were n’t good together , I was lying . I know deep down in my heart , we can be amazing together . That ’s if you ’ll let me show you . ”
59996	60012	59978	59978	I	0	“ You do n’t have to show me . I already know we will be . ”
60019	60023	60024	60024	He	1122	“ Thank you . ”
60058	60063	60064	60064	I	0	“ They ’re here , ”
60070	60073	60074	60074	he	1122	“ Where ? ”
60082	60095	60096	60096	I	0	“ Behind you . Umm , you did n’t go to Hawaii ? ”
60099	60146	60147	60147	He	1122	“ Oh . Well , no . I already apologized to Nora about that and told her I was n’t going alone . So you need to repack because we ’re going to Hawaii together , like planned , to scatter the last of her ashes . ”
60150	60165	60147	60147	He	1122	“ That wo n’t be a problem because I have n’t even unpacked yet . ”
60169	60241	60166	60166	I	0	“ Let ’s drive to your house and pick up your suitcase . You can spend the night here and we ’ll leave tomorrow . I have the private jet on standby . Wait , Sadie made dinner . Why do n’t you call John and Scott and have them come over for dinner ? That way , they can bring your suitcase and I can get to know them better . ”
60242	60254	60255	60255	I	0	“ Sounds like fun . I ’ll call them right now . ”
60285	60298	60273	60273	John	73	“ He said he and Scott will be here within the hour . ”
60319	60334	60335	60335	He	83	“ Good . That gives me just enough time to make love to you . ”
60365	60386	60387	60387	Ano	131	“ I ’m a little surprised as to why your sister would want her ashes scattered here , Mr. Grayson , ”
60393	60396	60387	60387	Ano	131	“ Why ? ”
60397	60405	60387	60387	Ano	131	“ You ’ve never heard the legend ? ”
60406	60417	60387	60387	Ano	131	“ No . I ca n’t say that I have . ”
60418	60424	60425	60425	Zoey	97	“ I have n’t either , ”
60428	60481	60482	60482	He	131	“ It ’s a story about a warrior and the beautiful princess he was going to marry . The warrior was so in love with his princess that he was afraid other men would be taken by her beauty , so he hid her away in that sea cave right over there . ”
60485	60541	60482	60482	He	131	“ Then one day , a Kona storm came through and the princess drowned . The warrior took her body and buried her where the top of that rock is over there . Because he was so heartbroken and grief stricken , he took his own life by jumping from the top of the rock . ”
60542	60545	60546	60546	Zoey	97	“ Wow , ”
60549	60553	60546	60546	Zoey	97	“ How tragic . ”
60554	60580	60482	60482	He	131	“ I ’ll leave the two of you alone for a while . When you ’re ready to head back , just let me know . ”
60581	60587	60588	60588	I	0	“ Thank you , Ano , ”
60597	60616	60595	60595	Zoey	97	“ You do n’t by any chance see the warrior and his princess around here , do you ? ”
60617	60620	60621	60621	She	97	“ No . ”
60624	60636	60621	60621	She	97	“ I now know why Nora wanted her ashes scattered here . ”
60637	60640	60641	60641	Zoey	97	“ Why ? ”
60644	60659	60660	60660	She	97	“ Because of my father . He was so heartbroken after my mother died . ”
60674	60681	60668	60668	her	97	“ I ’m sorry , Carter . ”
60682	60693	60694	60694	I	0	“ Let ’s get these ashes scattered . Shall we ? ”
60768	60773	60774	60774	Zoey	97	“ She ’s here , ”
60777	60787	60774	60774	Zoey	97	“ She ’s standing on top of the rock . ”
60788	60799	60774	60774	Zoey	97	“ I really hate that I ca n’t see her . ”
60800	60813	60774	60774	Zoey	97	“ Close your eyes , Carter . You ’ll feel her presence . ”
60814	60825	60826	60826	I	0	“ Goodbye , Nora . May you rest in peace , ”
60868	60871	60872	60872	She	97	“ What ? ”
60876	60895	60872	60872	She	97	“ Is it too early in our relationship to tell you that I ’m in love with you ? ”
60896	60903	60946	60946	her	97	“ I do n’t think so . ”
60904	60914	60872	60872	She	97	“ I wo n’t scare you off or anything ? ”
60915	60932	60872	60872	She	97	“ I do n’t know . Maybe you should try telling me and see what happens . ”
60933	60940	60941	60941	I	0	“ I love you , Zoey . ”
60949	60957	60958	60958	She	97	“ I love you too , Carter . ”

61152	61157	61140	61140	I	0	“ What ? Why ? ”
61158	61176	61177	61177	He	0	“ I think it ’s time for a change . A new start in a new place . ”
61180	61187	61177	61177	He	0	“ Where are you moving to ? ”
61188	61199	61140	61140	I	0	“ Same area . Different building . I have options . ”
61200	61210	61211	61211	I	0	“ You mean you have buildings you already own . ”
61214	61218	61219	61219	He	0	“ That too . ”
61222	61229	61219	61219	He	0	“ There ’s only one problem . ”
61230	61233	61140	61140	I	0	“ What ? ”
61234	61254	61140	61140	I	0	“ I want someone to move in with me , but I ’m not sure if she wants to . ”
61255	61272	61219	61219	He	0	“ Well , the only way you ’ll find out is if you ask that someone . ”
61273	61281	61140	61140	I	0	“ And what if she says no ? ”
61282	61289	61290	61290	I	0	“ What if she says yes ? ”
61293	61309	61290	61290	I	0	“ Okay , here it goes . Will you move in with me , Zoey ? ”

61361	61375	61376	61376	He	0	“ I guess we ’re just two happy people , are n’t we ? ”
61379	61385	61386	61386	He	0	“ Yes , we are . ”

61602	61612	61571	61571	Holly	75	“ Standing at your elevator waiting to come up . ”

61810	61881	61882	61882	She	75	“ The shop is located at East 34th Street and I ’m moving into this building in an apartment on the fourth floor ! I ’ve been in cahoots with your amazing boyfriend . He happens to own the building over on East 34th and he ’s giving me a super low rent deal on an apartment here . I take back every bad thing I ever said about him . ”
61885	61893	61882	61882	She	75	“ What ? When did this happen ? ”

I mean , I know you ’ve taken a lot of time off since everything that ’s happened , and now that we ’re settled in here , I just was wondering what you ’re going to do .

62334	62394	62328	62328	her	1165	“ I ’d been thinking about that also . I love my job , but things are different now . I still want to be a hospice nurse , so I ’m going to have to figure things out . Meanwhile , I have enough money saved that I can take off some more time to figure it out . ”
62395	62422	62328	62328	her	1165	“ Money will never be an issue for you again . So , do n’t worry about that . I have all the money you need . ”
62423	62440	62328	62328	her	1165	“ Thank you , my love . But I would like to earn my own money . ”

62577	62599	62547	62547	he	85	“ It ’s done . I got the call this morning . I ca n’t wait to run it by Zoey . ”
62600	62612	62544	62544	Ross	85	“ And what if she ’s not too keen about it ? ”
62613	62633	62547	62547	he	85	“ I think she will be . But if she is n’t , then I ’ll sell the building . ”
62634	62650	62547	62547	he	85	“ You ’ll take a huge loss . You paid a pretty penny for that . ”
62651	62701	62547	62547	he	85	“ I ’m not worried about it . If I take a loss , I take a loss . I ’m pretty confident that everything will work out . In fact , I ’m going to pick up the keys now and then I ’m going to call Zoey . ”

I ’m a changed man because of her and I ’ll become an even better man for my daughter . I promise to take care of them and protect them for the rest of my life .
