1620	1627	1628	1628	he	25	“ Where are you , Mia ? ”
1636	1650	1628	1628	he	25	“ Do n’t do this to me . Please . I need you . ”

2914	2923	2924	2924	she	146	“ I just want you to be happy , ”
3028	3074	3075	3075	Max	25	“ I feel the same way about Mia as you feel about Sam . I loved her . I still do . Her death did n’t change that . There is n’t anyone else for me , Maddie . She was my one and only . ”
3093	3108	3084	3084	she	27	“ I ca n’t be with anyone else . Not now . Not ever . ”
3109	3121	3084	3084	she	27	“ You feel that way now , Max , but someday — ”
3122	3144	3145	3145	He	25	“ I ’ll feel exactly the same way next year , ten years from now , and every day after that . ”
3208	3226	3227	3227	Her	27	“ If something happened to Sam , when would you be ready to be with someone else ? ”
3414	3417	3418	3418	Maddie	27	“ Never , ”
3437	3481	3418	3418	Maddie	27	“ I ’d never be ready because Sam was the only man for me . I understand . And I ’m sorry . I just feel so damn helpless . I want to help , but I do n’t know what to do . ”
3539	3558	3534	3534	he	25	“ You already help me . Just by being my sister . I do n’t need anything else . ”
3596	3620	3630	3635	his brother - in - law	163	“ Hey . You two better break it up before Sam comes over here and breaks both your arms and kicks your ass . ”
3942	3954	3955	3955	Max	25	“ It ’s not my fault . You went with him , ”
4071	4080	4081	4081	she	27	“ Did you two have a good romp ? ”
4110	4130	4105	4105	Maddie	27	“ Yeah . Tucker completely wiped me out and worked me out . The dog sets a brutal pace , ”
4441	4457	4458	4458	Maddie	27	“ Well , it was very sweet of you to take Tucker for some exercise , ”
4471	4501	4458	4458	Maddie	27	“ Hey , knock that off . Sam puts up with Max getting a little affection , but if you are n’t related , you better keep your distance . ”
4530	4540	4541	4541	Kade	29	“ We are related by marriage … sort of , ”
4563	4580	4581	4581	Simon	32	“ She ’s the sister of my brother - in - law . That should count . ”
4638	4654	4629	4629	he	32	“ Does n’t count . If you are n’t related by blood , forget it . ”
4663	4699	4700	4700	Max	25	“ Kade ’s like family . Leave him alone , caveman . We happen to like it that he treats Maddie and I like sisters . I ’ve made Kade and Max my honorary brothers . ”
4706	4724	4725	4725	he	25	“ So can we come on over there and give you a brotherly little hug , Kara ? ”
4805	4820	4821	4821	Simon	32	“ Come one step closer and you ’ll both end up in the hospital , ”
4901	4905	4906	4906	Simon	32	“ Just wait , ”
4909	4913	4906	4906	Simon	32	“ Payback sucks . ”
5524	5527	5528	5528	he	25	“ Mia , ”
5576	5591	5592	5592	Kade	29	“ Do n’t do this to yourself , man . It is n’t her , ”
5630	5635	5636	5636	Max	25	“ I feel her , ”
5663	5729	5656	5656	Kade	29	“ Her eyes are the same color , but that ’s all . It is n’t her . Look at her , Max . She has short , dark hair . She ’s thin . Nothing is the same except her eyes . There are lots of women with blue eyes . Stop torturing yourself . Mia ’s gone and she ’s never coming back . ”
5972	5983	5984	5984	he	25	“ Wait . I just wanted to talk to you , ”
6073	6076	6077	6077	Max	25	“ Fuck . ”
6136	6141	6142	6142	he	25	“ Are you okay ? ”
6175	6182	6165	6165	she	26	“ You did n’t shave today . ”
6274	6277	6278	6278	He	25	“ Mia ? ”
6323	6334	6335	6335	she	221	“ No . I ’m not the woman you want , ”
6394	6404	6390	6390	he	25	“ No . Wake up . Stay with me . ”
6488	6504	6475	6475	Max	25	“ Have you lost your damn mind ? Why did you take off like that ? ”
6514	6520	6475	6475	Max	25	“ What happened to her ? ”
6521	6548	6475	6475	Max	25	“ Fell . She ’s unconscious , smashed her head against the concrete . We need to get her to a hospital . Call an ambulance . ”
6752	6761	6762	6762	Sam	28	“ I can carry her for a while , ”
6781	6784	6785	6785	Max	25	“ No , ”
6828	6847	6824	6824	he	25	“ You ca n’t hang on to her until the ambulance gets here . It could take awhile . ”
6855	6862	6863	6863	Max	25	“ The hell I ca n’t , ”
6880	6897	6875	6875	he	25	“ She ’s my wife . I ’ll carry her as long as I need to . ”
6933	6940	6941	6941	Sam	28	“ You think that ’s Mia ? ”
6946	6951	6952	6952	Max	25	“ It is Mia , ”
6956	6966	6952	6952	Max	25	“ Max , she does n’t look like Mia — ”
6987	6992	6975	6975	his	25	“ It ’s her . ”
7038	7043	7044	7044	Kade	29	“ Ambulance is coming , ”
7063	7084	7058	7058	he	29	“ Max , I know you think that ’s Mia , but you must know that she really is n’t . ”
7108	7118	7119	7119	she	26	“ What happened ? Why are you carrying me ? ”
7122	7132	7119	7119	she	26	“ You fell and hit your head , sweetheart , ”
7137	7145	7146	7146	she	26	“ Can you put me down please ? ”
7156	7164	7153	7153	he	25	“ Not happening . You ’re hurt . ”
7173	7206	7167	7167	she	26	“ Kade , can you tell Max that I ’m fine ? Where did you get that horrible shirt ? I think that ’s worse than the one with the purple birds . ”
7216	7245	7246	7246	She	26	“ Why are Simon and Sam here ? Where the hell are we ? Dammit ! I feel like I got run over by a semi - truck . ”
7296	7300	7301	7301	Simon	32	“ Holy shit , ”
7374	7398	7368	7368	he	29	“ Travis ? I need you to meet us at the hospital . We think we found Mia , and she ’s alive . ”
7507	7514	7519	7521	the young medic	260	“ Are you hurt , sir ? ”
7558	7561	7562	7562	he	25	“ No , ”
7570	7574	7562	7562	he	25	“ Not anymore . ”
7893	7951	7952	7952	Maddie	27	“ I ’ve talked to all of her doctors , Max . Even the consulting psychiatrist . Her traumatic brain injury is fairly mild ; she ’s experiencing some symptoms of post - concussion syndrome with retrograde amnesia . She really does n’t remember the last two and a half years or what occurred during that time . ”
7992	8009	7984	7984	Max	25	“ Could you put that in layman ’s terms , Maddie ? What does it mean ? ”
8055	8120	8121	8121	She	146	“ It means when she smashed her head into the cement , it scrambled her brain around inside of her skull and screwed up some of the tiny cells that exist inside the brain . She ’s fine , Max . Really . There ’s nothing significant on her MRI . The headache and dizziness will eventually subside and her memory should come back . ”
8306	8316	8300	8300	Sam	28	“ We ’ll figure out what happened , Max . ”
8442	8474	8475	8475	Maddie	27	“ You need to sleep , Max . You ’ve been here for two days straight . Go home and get some rest . Mia can go home in the morning . ”
8571	8584	8585	8585	he	25	“ I ’m staying . I ’ll sleep when we go home , ”
8601	8615	8585	8585	he	25	“ You two need to take off . I ’ll be fine here . ”
8725	8739	8740	8740	Maddie	27	“ I do n’t want to leave you alone here tonight , Max , ”
8812	8842	8843	8843	His	25	“ Thank you for being here when I needed you , but I ’m not alone anymore . Mia ’s here . I ’m exactly where I should be . ”
8865	8877	8878	8878	Sam	28	“ Take her home . She ’s pregnant with my nephew . ”
8881	8887	8888	8888	He	28	“ You mean my daughter ? ”
8900	8904	8905	8905	he	25	“ My nephew , ”
8989	9005	8977	8977	Sam	28	“ Now you can have one of your own , buddy . See you tomorrow . ”
9569	9575	9576	9576	he	25	“ What are you doing ? ”
9630	9652	9653	9653	She	81	“ Research . I ’m trying to find out more about what happened to me and why I ca n’t remember . ”
9719	9730	9699	9699	He	25	“ And what did you find out , Madame Detective ? ”
9731	9758	9759	9759	She	81	“ Not much . Nothing the doctors have n’t already told me . I did find it a little spooky reading about my own supposed death . ”
9772	9812	9813	9813	She	81	“ Losing over two years of my life is scary . It seems like just yesterday that we were attending the Bannister Charity Dinner , but I can feel the hole in my life , that everything ’s changed . ”
9819	9824	9813	9813	She	81	“ I ’ve changed . ”
9825	9843	9844	9844	Max	25	“ We ’ll figure it all out , sweetheart . I swear . Everything will be okay , ”
9861	9869	9870	9870	Her	81	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
9883	9900	9870	9870	Her	81	“ Obviously I have n’t been living a life of leisure . My hands are rough . ”
9919	9937	9901	9901	Max	25	“ You ’ve never lived a life of leisure . You ’re the busiest woman I know . ”
9966	9976	9977	9977	she	81	“ Oh well . At least I ’m thin , ”
10041	10054	10055	10055	he	25	“ It ’s nothing that some good Italian food wo n’t fix , ”
10065	10071	10062	10062	She	81	“ Pasta is my enemy . ”
10072	10077	10080	10080	her	81	“ You love it , ”
10159	10198	10156	10156	she	81	“ I had them do a DNA test . My brothers provided their blood for me to have it done . It would n’t be as conclusive as it would be if my mom was still alive but — ”
10199	10212	10151	10151	her	81	“ Why ? I know you ’re my wife . You know — “
10213	10237	10297	10297	her	26	“ I want you to know for certain . I disappeared for over two years . You deserve some sort of scientific proof . ”
10238	10263	10264	10264	he	322	“ I do n’t need it . I have no doubts . I knew the moment I saw you in the park , Mia , ”
10280	10288	10289	10289	Mia	26	“ I think my brother wants it , ”
10310	10313	10314	10314	Max	25	“ Travis , ”
10324	10342	10343	10343	Mia	26	“ No . I think Travis believes me . But I ’m not so sure about Kade , ”
10350	10361	10343	10343	Mia	26	“ Kade ? Why the fuck does he want it ? ”
10389	10395	10396	10396	he	25	“ I ’ll kill him , ”
10421	10468	10469	10469	Mia	26	“ He did n’t really ask . I offered . And I think it ’s important that we get rid of any doubts for a lot of reasons . Kade just seems different , distant , and hesitant to accept that I ’m really his sister . ”
10472	10507	10469	10469	Mia	26	“ Maybe it ’s just from the disappointment of the accident and his girlfriend breaking up with him . But he seems uncertain , and I do n’t want anyone to have any doubts . ”
10508	10516	10517	10517	Max	25	“ I ’m still fucking killing him , ”
10521	10538	10539	10539	Mia	26	“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever heard you drop the f - bomb before , ”
10543	10556	10557	10557	Max	25	“ Yeah … well … things have changed . I ’ve changed , ”
10576	10603	10604	10604	she	26	“ I ’m different , too . I remember our life together before I disappeared , but I do n’t feel like that same person anymore , ”
10615	10620	10604	10604	she	26	“ I ’m sorry . ”
10621	10624	10625	10625	Max	25	“ Hey . ”
10640	10669	10625	10625	Max	25	“ It does n’t matter . I never stopped loving you . And I never will . We ’ll start over , get to know each other again . ”
10768	10771	10772	10772	she	26	“ Okay , ”
10776	10794	10772	10772	she	26	“ You should go home and get some rest . You look exhausted . Have you slept ? ”
10800	10817	10795	10795	He	25	“ Not much . And I ’m not leaving until I can take you home tomorrow . ”
10818	10827	10828	10828	she	26	“ You need sleep . You look tired , ”
10842	10847	10850	10850	her	26	“ I ’ll sleep , ”
10869	10872	10873	10873	He	25	“ Here . ”
10888	10895	10882	10882	She	26	“ Will you sleep with me ? ”
10950	10970	10971	10971	Mia	26	“ I stink . I have n’t showered and I ’ve been in the same clothes for two days . ”
10991	11009	10975	10975	her	26	“ Bathroom is over there and Maddie brought you clean clothes . They ’re in the drawer . ”
11054	11058	11059	11059	he	25	“ Five minutes , ”
11205	11214	11215	11215	he	25	“ Jesus . I missed this so much , ”
11254	11277	11278	11278	she	26	“ I do n’t remember us not being together , but I know that I missed it too . I love you , ”
11340	11360	11361	11361	His	25	“ I love you , too . I did n’t think I ’d ever get to hold you again . ”
11372	11382	11383	11383	she	26	“ I ’m not sure my nurse will approve , ”
11390	11397	11398	11398	he	25	“ Do n’t give a fuck , ”
11412	11417	11398	11398	he	25	“ Are you comfortable ? ”
11418	11426	11427	11427	she	26	“ Yes . You smell so good , ”
11434	11439	11427	11427	she	26	“ Are you okay ? ”
11440	11467	11468	11468	he	25	“ Hell , no . Hospital beds are like torture devices . But you could n’t blast me out of this position with dynamite right now , ”
11473	11489	11468	11468	he	25	“ And I owe Maddie a hell of a nice present for the clean clothes . ”
11490	11511	11512	11512	she	26	“ She ’s wonderful , Max . I ’m so happy you found each other . How did it happen ? ”
11523	11616	11516	11516	He	25	“ Fate . Or maybe just dumb luck . I saw her at Simon ’s wedding to Kara and she looked just like an old picture of our birth mother . It made me want to dig into my past and I finally found the proof that we were brother and sister . Unfortunately , she did n’t get adopted and she ’s had it pretty tough . I wish I had known earlier . I was just a baby when we were separated and neither one of us remembered the other . ”
11617	11623	11624	11624	Mia	26	“ She seems happy now , ”
11627	11644	11645	11645	Max	25	“ She is . How could she not be ? She has me for a brother , ”
11651	11680	11681	11681	Mia	26	“ I know she ’s happy to have you as a brother , but I sort of think Sam has a little bit to do with it too , ”
11687	11795	11681	11681	Mia	26	“ They look so happy . Maddie told me some of their story . I never thought Sam would become so domesticated . I guess underneath the playboy exterior , he was always yearning for Maddie . I guess both Simon and Sam are finally happy . It seems so strange that everything has changed so much . It ’s almost like I went to sleep one night and woke up to an alternate universe . But I ’m glad both of them found the right woman . I ’m glad . I always worried about them . I wish that would happen for Kade and Travis . ”
11834	11841	11830	11830	Max	25	“ I hope so , too . ”
11877	11906	11865	11865	Max	25	“ Will you stay for a while ? Until I remember or at least get used to the fact that I do n’t remember the last few years ? ”
11914	11926	11907	11907	Her	26	“ Everything just seems so dissimilar to what I can remember . ”
11927	11936	11937	11937	he	25	“ Sweetheart , I ’m staying all night , ”
11947	11998	11941	11941	She	26	“ That ’s not what I meant . I was wondering if you could put off your business trips . Just for a little while . The media will have a field day with this , and I was hoping you might be able to stick around for a while . ”
12010	12019	11941	11941	She	26	“ Mia , I ’m not going anywhere . ”
12020	12035	12036	12036	she	26	“ What about work , your plan to conquer the business and political world ? ”
12085	12106	12107	12107	He	25	“ I told you I ’ve changed . I do n’t want the same things as I wanted back then . ”
12116	12141	12113	12113	he	25	“ And I ’ve conquered everything I want to conquer in the business world . I do n’t need to travel like that anymore . ”
12165	12175	12113	12113	he	25	“ I ’m afraid you ’re stuck with me . ”
12176	12186	12187	12187	Mia	26	“ It will be nice to have you home , ”
12193	12229	12187	12187	Mia	26	“ I miss you so much when you ’re gone . I need you to help me get used to all the changes that have happened . I wish my memory would just come back . ”
12280	12292	12293	12293	he	25	“ You wo n’t have a chance to even miss me , ”
12306	12343	12302	12302	he	25	“ You ’re also going to be surrounded by security from this day forward . No arguments . No more going around unsecured . No more ducking our security . You ’re being protected . Always . ”
12344	12365	12366	12366	she	26	“ I know I ought to disagree , but I wo n’t . Not now . I ’m actually relieved , ”
12377	12391	12392	12392	he	25	“ And you are n’t going to be exposed to the media either , ”
12396	12417	12392	12392	he	25	“ I ’ll make a brief statement when the media finds out , and that ’s all they ’re getting . ”
12418	12435	12436	12436	Mia	26	“ I ’d rather avoid them for now . At least until I remember what happened . ”
12455	12461	12445	12445	she	26	“ Max , are you … ”
12481	12525	12526	12526	he	25	“ Am I hard ? Yep . My cock is like granite right now . Everything about you arouses me , and I ’ve been without for over two years , sweetheart . So you need to quit squirming against me like that , ”
12529	12533	12526	12526	he	25	“ Be still . ”
12544	12554	12540	12540	she	26	“ You didn’t … you never … nobody ever … ”
12561	12573	12555	12555	She	26	“ You did n’t sleep with anyone while I was gone ? ”
12574	12598	12599	12599	he	25	“ Nope . And I did n’t fuck anyone either . I had no desire to screw a woman who was n’t you , ”
12603	12612	12555	12555	She	26	“ But did n’t you ever want to — ”
12613	12641	12642	12642	Max	25	“ The only thing I wanted was my wife . So I got myself off thinking of you , because there was no one else I wanted . ”
12674	12680	12681	12681	She	26	“ Does that surprise you ? ”
12701	12714	12715	12715	Her	26	“ Actually , the thought of you doing that is pretty hot . ”
12751	12759	12760	12760	she	26	“ I wish I could have watched , ”
12849	12857	12858	12858	he	25	“ Go to sleep and behave yourself , ”
12870	12878	12858	12858	he	25	“ Okay . Promise you ’ll stay ? ”
12908	12912	12913	12913	Max	25	“ I promise . ”
12987	13000	13001	13001	Max	25	“ Are n’t you ever going to stop looking and buy something ? ”
13025	13035	13001	13001	Max	25	“ You ’ve been looking for over an hour . ”
13100	13102	13096	13096	her	26	“ off ”
13293	13300	13301	13301	she	26	“ Everything ’s so expensive here , ”
13313	13321	13322	13322	Max	25	“ I think I can afford it , ”
13464	13480	13457	13457	She	26	“ It just seems ridiculous to pay hundreds for a pair of jeans . Why ? ”
13481	13509	13510	13510	His	25	“ Why , why , why ? You ’re still the most inquisitive female I ’ve ever known and I think that ’s still your favorite word . ”
13527	13535	13536	13536	she	26	“ It just does n’t make sense , ”
13601	13618	13619	13619	He	25	“ What happened to the woman who bought her clothing without even checking the price tag ? ”
13639	13681	13619	13619	He	25	“ I ’m wealthy , Mia . Incredibly wealthy . And for that matter , so are you . Your grandmother ’s trust has done nothing but grow since you ’ve been gone . You never touched a penny of it . ”
13689	13735	13682	13682	Mia	26	“ I know that . I do n’t know why I feel the way I do . I know how I used to feel , and it was me ; it was who I was . Now I do n’t know who I am anymore . ”
13762	13783	13755	13760	the woman who Max loved again	356	“ I feel like I should pretend to be the way I was before because you loved me that way . ”
13784	13792	13793	13793	Max	25	“ I. Still . Love . You , ”
13809	13822	13793	13793	Max	25	“ Do you think I give a fuck about your shopping habits ? ”
13916	13925	13926	13926	she	26	“ You dropped the f - bomb again , ”
14021	14028	14029	14029	he	25	“ Does my cursing bother you ? ”
14045	14048	14049	14049	she	26	“ No , ”
14137	14148	14149	14149	he	25	“ Good . Then I do n’t give a fuck , ”
14350	14376	14341	14341	his	25	“ Shit . We ’re in the middle of a goddamn mall and I ’m ready to tear your clothes off and fuck you blind . ”
14386	14396	14397	14397	Mia	26	“ I did n’t think you wanted to anymore , ”
14404	14455	14456	14456	He	25	“ Oh , I want to . You have no idea the things I want to do to you . I ’m just not sure you ’re ready for it . I told you I ’ve changed , Mia . And I ’m not sure I can control myself anymore . ”
14489	14494	14481	14481	his	25	“ Then do n’t . ”
14558	14563	14564	14564	Mia	26	“ I need you . ”
14613	14619	14620	14620	he	25	“ I ’m losing it , ”
14633	14650	14651	14651	he	25	“ Find some stuff . Walk away , Mia , before I embarrass both of us , ”
15091	15110	15111	15111	she	26	“ Are you upset about what happened ? I know you hate undignified displays of affection in public , ”
15125	15139	15140	15140	he	25	“ Hell no , I ’m not upset . I ’m pissed off , ”
15144	15147	15140	15140	he	25	“ Why ? ”
15158	15168	15169	15169	he	25	“ Because I could n’t finish what I started , ”
15179	15201	15173	15173	his	25	“ You have no idea how close you just came to being fucked up against a wall by your desperate husband . ”
15202	15210	15211	15211	she	26	“ There was always the dressing room , ”
15265	15271	15253	15253	he	25	“ Now you tell me . ”
15272	15279	15280	15280	she	26	“ Would you have done it ? ”
15294	15305	15306	15306	he	25	“ In a heartbeat , had I thought of it , ”
15339	15348	15349	15349	Mia	26	“ We could n’t have done that anyway , ”
15353	15364	15349	15349	Mia	26	“ Unless you ’re carrying a condom in your pocket . ”
15372	15382	15365	15365	Max	25	“ Why ? We ’ve never needed one before . ”
15395	15417	15365	15365	Max	25	“ Because we do n’t know what happened to me , Max . You have no idea what could have happened . ”
15418	15426	15427	15427	Max	25	“ Are you afraid you were unfaithful ? ”
15433	15436	15437	15437	she	26	“ No , ”
15440	15491	15437	15437	she	26	“ Whatever happened , I know myself , maybe better than I ever did before , and I never had thoughts about being with any other man but you . I love you the same way you love me . But we do n’t know if I was abducted or … ”
15508	15551	15503	15503	she	26	“ raped . I ca n’t put you at risk , Max . Not until I know for sure exactly what happened . I ’ll see my doctor and get a check - up , but I need to regain my memory . ”
15564	15606	15552	15552	Max	25	“ You will . Sweetheart , you know if something did happen , I ’ll kill whoever did it . And it wo n’t make a bit of difference in how I feel about you . Tell me you know that . ”
15614	15625	15626	15626	she	26	“ If it happened , it was n’t by choice , ”
15635	15661	15626	15626	she	26	“ I love you , Max . So very much it hurts . It makes my skin crawl just thinking about being with anyone else . ”
15678	15685	15672	15672	his	25	“ You ’ll be with me . ”
15686	15691	15672	15672	his	25	“ I ca n’t . ”
15705	15722	15723	15723	he	25	“ I ’ll empty every drugstore in Tampa and the surrounding area of their condom supply , ”
15795	15805	15784	15784	She	26	“ Kind of ambitious , do n’t you think ? ”
15806	15811	15812	15812	he	25	“ Not at all , ”
15817	15831	15812	15812	he	25	“ I ’m thinking I might need more flown in from other cities . ”
15868	15879	15853	15853	he	25	“ Thinking about finishing what we started in the mall ? ”
15880	15891	15892	15892	he	25	“ Yeah . And then starting it all over again , ”
15917	15927	15913	15913	Mia	26	“ Later . You can definitely finish it later . ”
15928	15933	15934	15934	Max	25	“ Count on it , ”
15994	16008	16009	16009	Mia	26	“ I ca n’t find my wedding ring . I ’ve searched everywhere , ”
16036	16054	16055	16055	Max	25	“ You had to have been wearing it when you disappeared . It ’s never been here , ”
16103	16122	16097	16097	he	25	“ Why would I take it off if I was wearing it ? I never took it off . ”
16123	16127	16128	16128	he	25	“ I know , ”
16132	16139	16128	16128	he	25	“ I wondered about that myself . ”
16209	16215	16216	16216	she	26	“ I ca n’t remember , ”
16247	16270	16307	16307	he	25	“ Tell me what happened after I disappeared . Were there ever any clues to where I went , what I did ? ”
16271	16274	16275	16275	Max	25	“ No , ”
16279	16294	16295	16295	He	25	“ The last thing you remember happened a week or two before you disappeared . ”
16310	16368	16307	16307	he	25	“ I ’m not even completely sure what day you vanished . I found your things on the beach the day I came home from an overnight business trip . It could have been the day I left or the following day . I came home late . I hated myself for ever leaving on that trip . ”
16378	16403	16369	16369	He	25	“ Max , it was n’t your fault . You were considering running for public office , and you had business out of town — ”
16404	16453	16462	16462	he	25	“ It was bullshit . All of it . I never wanted to be a politician , and I could have left most of the traveling to upper management . I was a goddamn coward , Mia . I took those trips to take a break from us . ”
16504	16516	16497	16497	he	25	“ Was I suffocating you because I loved you too much ? ”
16625	16661	16617	16617	he	25	“ It was n’t you ; it was me . I wanted to be smothered by you ; I wanted to be the only man you saw , the only man who existed for you . ”
16662	16669	16677	16677	he	25	“ But Max , you were — ”
16670	16676	16677	16677	he	25	“ It was n’t enough , ”
16702	16803	16677	16677	he	25	“ The things I wanted were n’t right in my mind . My dad loved my mom and treated her with tenderness and devotion . Although I felt those things too , there was also this total obsession that I did n’t think was right , natural . You ’re my wife , a woman who deserves my respect . I never wanted you to leave me . I did n’t want to scare you away by acting like a lunatic . The way I felt was n’t rational . I wanted to kill any man who looked at you . ”
16888	16898	16899	16899	she	393	“ So you ’re really a closet dominant male ? ”
17012	17059	17060	17060	he	25	“ I think I ’m beyond that , and I do n’t think I ’m in the closet anymore . And I ’m still perfectly rational with everyone and everything except you . You ’re the only woman who ’s ever made me feel this way , ”
17271	17291	17405	17405	Max	25	“ You can be whoever you really are with me , Max . I ’ll never stop loving you . ”
17292	17404	17405	17405	Max	25	“ I think that ’s the problem . I was never truly alive until I met you . I was the guy who never lost his temper , never let emotions get in the way of a business deal , and I was pretty much indifferent about everything . The only thing I wanted was to be a good son to my adoptive parents because they had given me so much . I guess I thought I needed to be in their image , act like a Hamilton , to make up for the fact that I was n’t their blood child . I did n’t even know who I was , ”
17408	17418	17405	17405	Max	25	“ And do you know who you are now ? ”
17436	17440	17441	17441	he	25	“ Not completely , ”
17448	17491	17441	17441	he	25	“ But I can guarantee you that I ’m not indifferent , especially not when it comes to you . I know exactly how I feel about you . I always have . I just was n’t sure you could handle it . ”
17492	17496	17497	17497	she	26	“ I can , ”
17518	17531	17509	17509	she	26	“ Tell me what happened after you found out I was missing . ”
17541	17599	17538	17538	he	25	“ Obviously , there was an extensive search , but it only lasted about a week because there were no leads . After that , they were convinced you had either drowned or there was only one possible suspect if you were murdered . They were n’t really looking at other possibilities because nothing else made sense . ”
17600	17603	17604	17604	she	26	“ Who ? ”
17610	17613	17614	17614	he	25	“ Me , ”
17623	17644	17617	17617	his	25	“ A woman with no real enemies vanishes and ca n’t be found , the usual suspect is her husband . ”
17645	17657	17617	17617	his	25	“ Oh , God . Max , I ’m so sorry . ”
17675	17688	17689	17689	Max	25	“ There was no motive , no reason to even suspect you . ”
17692	17792	17689	17689	Max	25	“ Crime of passion ? Another woman ? Another man ? Money ? Believe me … they checked every possibility , dug through every record to make sure I had n’t done anything to you for any of those reasons . When they finally decided I was n’t guilty , they assumed you had drowned . They said they did n’t suspect foul play . There was never a demand for ransom , no reason to believe you were abducted . There was no activity on any of your accounts . It was like you had just … vanished . ”
17839	17847	17829	17829	she	26	“ The media must have been horrible . ”
17848	17873	17875	17875	she	26	“ Luckily I was spared that part of it . They kept the investigation quiet . I cooperated , gave them whatever they wanted . ”
17932	17950	17928	17928	she	26	“ I wish I could remember . I wish I knew why I did this to you . ”
17974	18014	17951	17951	Max	25	“ Hey , do n’t cry . You do n’t know what your reason was or what happened . Do n’t blame yourself . I survived . You ’re here now . That ’s all that matters to me . ”
18030	18051	18026	18026	she	26	“ Why are you still wearing your ring ? You must have given up hope , thought I was dead . ”
18142	18198	18137	18137	he	25	“ I never gave up hope . Right after you disappeared , I made a promise to you that I ’d never give up . I could n’t . In my heart , I never accepted that you were dead . I guess I thought that if you really were , I would feel it . ”
18314	18326	18304	18304	she	26	“ I want to remember . I have to know why . ”
18351	18372	18346	18346	his	25	“ Stop it , Mia . Stop doing this to yourself . You ’ll remember and everything will be fine . ”
18774	18782	18783	18783	she	26	“ Something ’s not right , Tucker , ”
18832	18844	18845	18845	she	26	“ Has he been playing like this while I was gone ? ”
18910	18915	18916	18916	she	26	“ Go to him , ”
19448	19451	19452	19452	he	25	“ Mia , ”
19465	19477	19478	19478	he	25	“ She ’s here somewhere . She has to be here , ”
19508	19514	19515	19515	he	25	“ No . Fuck no , ”
19565	19572	19554	19554	he	25	“ No , goddammit . No . ”
19654	19667	19645	19645	she	26	“ Max . Shit . You scared the hell out of me . ”
19693	19700	19701	19701	he	25	“ Get out of the water , ”
19717	19720	19721	19721	He	25	“ Now ! ”
19742	19757	19758	19758	she	26	“ I ’m close to shore . The water is barely over my head , ”
19769	19772	19758	19758	she	26	“ Move . ”
20047	20050	20051	20051	His	25	“ Mine . ”
20207	20210	20211	20211	Mia	26	“ Max ? ”
20273	20292	20293	20293	he	25	“ You ’ll never set foot on this beach again . Never . I fucking hate this place , ”
20376	20396	20397	20397	she	26	“ I ’ll make sure someone else is here . I promise . You know I love it here , ”
20400	20405	20406	20406	he	25	“ I hate it , ”
20424	20434	20435	20435	she	26	“ Let me go . Let me touch you , ”
20439	20456	20435	20435	she	26	“ No . I ’m going to fuck you here . Right here . Right now . ”He
20470	20499	20435	20435	she	26	“ I ’m going to taste you first until you beg for my cock , and then I ’ll fuck you until you beg for mercy , sweetheart . ”
20588	20591	20592	20592	she	26	“ Condom , ”
20596	20603	20613	20613	he	25	“ We need to get some . ”
20635	20643	20644	20644	he	25	“ It was my first goddamn priority , ”
20666	20678	20679	20679	she	26	“ Good . Then fuck me . And make me come , ”
20747	20778	20779	20779	he	25	“ Sweetheart , there ’s no question about whether or not you ’ll come . You will … and you ’ll be screaming my name while you ’re doing it , ”
20906	20913	20914	20914	she	26	“ I ’m not a screamer , ”
20925	20930	20931	20931	he	25	“ You will be , ”
20958	20963	20964	20964	he	25	“ Do n’t move , ”
21178	21188	21189	21189	she	26	“ Y - you actually want me to scream , ”
21266	21282	21283	21283	he	25	“ Oh hell , yeah . Scream , moan , beg , come for me , ”
21305	21312	21321	21321	him	25	“ I want to hear you . ”
21313	21318	21319	21319	she	26	“ We ’re outside , ”
21332	21339	21340	21340	he	25	“ You want me to stop ? ”
21378	21383	21384	21384	Her	26	“ No . Please . ”
21396	21405	21389	21389	her	26	“ I need you , Max . Now . ”
21406	21412	21413	21413	he	25	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
21434	21446	21447	21447	he	25	“ You belong to me , Mia . You always have , ”
21611	21625	21626	21626	he	25	“ This is mine . So feminine . So sweet . So delicious , ”
21694	21703	21704	21704	He	25	“ Oh God , please Max . Please . ”
21841	21846	21837	21837	She	26	“ Max . Please . ”
21861	21869	21856	21856	Max	25	“ Fuck me , Max . Please . ”
22040	22049	22050	22050	She	26	“ Max . Oh , yes . Max . ”
22159	22170	22171	22171	Max	25	“ I think you ’re the sexiest woman on earth , ”
22180	22212	22174	22174	his	25	“ Hearing you moan , scream my name , making you come . Fuck . There ’s no better feeling in the world . Except maybe having my cock inside you . ”
22276	22284	22320	22320	he	25	“ Fuck me , Max . Please . ”
22285	22319	22320	22320	he	25	“ Tell me you need me , Mia . ’Cause I know I fucking need you . I have to know you want me as much as I burn for you right now , ”
22431	22447	22448	22448	Mia	26	“ I need you . I need you so much I ca n’t stand it , ”
22456	22469	22451	22451	Max	25	“ I love you , Max . Always have . Always will . ”
22616	22636	22637	22637	he	25	“ And I love you , my beautiful , sexy Mia . Do n’t ever leave me alone again , ”
22651	22671	22637	22637	he	25	“ I wo n’t . I promise . Fuck me , Max . I ca n’t wait any longer . ”
22709	22731	22702	22702	His	25	“ You fuck me , sweetheart . I want to see you . I want to watch you come this time . ”
22842	22861	22862	22862	Max	25	“ Oh , hell yeah . Touch me . Make me believe you ’re really with me again , ”
22884	22893	22862	22862	Max	25	“ No . Fucking . Better . Feeling . ”
22986	22989	22990	22990	she	26	“ Max , ”
23141	23151	23152	23152	Max	25	“ Come for me , sweetheart . Let go , ”
23219	23228	23205	23205	She	26	“ It ’s too much . Too much . ”
23253	23260	23261	23261	he	25	“ Never enough . Never enough , ”
23408	23414	23405	23405	she	26	“ Still hate this beach ? ”
23415	23432	23433	23433	he	25	“ No . But now every time I come out here my cock will be hard , ”
23453	23463	23450	23450	she	26	“ Good . I ’ll come out with you . ”
23464	23470	23471	23471	he	25	“ You damn well better , ”
23491	23513	23484	23484	she	26	“ You ’ve certainly developed quite the potty mouth , Mr. Hamilton . I never knew you could talk that naughty . ”
23514	23526	23527	23527	Max	25	“ I ’m not quite sure I can restrain it anymore , ”
23535	23543	23527	23527	Max	25	“ You ’ve always made me crazy . ”
23544	23577	23578	23578	she	26	“ Then do n’t hold back . I love you , Max . Nothing between us is wrong . You can talk dirty to me any time . It turns me on , ”
23593	23603	23578	23578	she	26	“ Then I ’ll never try to control it . ”
23623	23646	23647	23647	His	25	“ Do n’t come out here alone , Mia . I ca n’t lose you again . I wo n’t survive it . ”
23701	23709	23694	23694	she	26	“ I wo n’t . I promise . ”
23728	23735	23736	23736	Max	25	“ See that you do n’t , ”
23815	23823	23824	23824	he	25	“ I ’ll never let you go , ”
23851	23866	23867	23867	she	26	“ The condoms . You did n’t grab them . We might need them , ”
23903	23924	23925	23925	He	25	“ Sweetheart , do you think I do n’t have some stashed in every nook and cranny of this house ? ”
23932	23942	23925	23925	He	25	“ I did mention that it was a priority . ”
23976	23982	23983	23983	she	26	“ Still feeling pretty ambitious ? ”
23995	24000	24001	24001	he	25	“ Depraved and deprived , ”
24007	24017	24018	24018	she	26	“ I think we can take care of that , ”
24029	24038	24039	24039	he	25	“ Oh , I ’m planning on it , ”
24063	24075	24076	24076	Mia	26	" Billionaire ’s Wife Returns From The Dead With No Memory ! ”
24102	24108	24109	24109	she	26	“ I hate the media , ”
24192	24237	24189	24189	he	25	“ Hey , do n’t let it upset you , sweetheart . I ’ll give a statement , they ’ll be hot on our trail for a while , and then they ’ll find something more interesting to write about . They always do . ”
24321	24347	24348	24348	Her	26	“ I ’m sorry . I know it ’s part of our life , but they never let up after what happened with my parents … ”
24481	24500	24501	24501	he	25	“ They wo n’t drag it up , Mia . I ’ll kill the first person who does , ”
24594	24629	24630	24630	She	26	“ I do n’t care about me . I can handle it . I do n’t want them to talk about it because it would be hard on you , Kade , and Travis . ”
24648	24658	24659	24659	Max	25	“ Me ? Why the hell would I care ? ”
24672	24695	24659	24659	Max	25	“ I ’m your wife . You ’re a billionaire businessman . I ’ve always tried to be the woman you need — ”
24696	24704	24705	24705	he	25	“ You are the woman I need , ”
24714	24728	24709	24709	his	25	“ I do n’t care who your parents were or what they did . ”
24729	24796	24709	24709	his	25	“ My father was insane . He shot my mother and then put the gun in his mouth and blew his brains out . You think they wo n’t wonder about my sanity ? Whether I ’m a little crazy too ? I ’m coming back from the dead , a big hole in my memory . I ’m sure people will judge by my history . ”
24804	24812	24813	24813	Max	25	“ It ’s not your goddamn history , ”
24826	24862	24823	24823	he	25	“ And anyone who judges you by something your parents did is n’t somebody we need to give a shit about . You , Kade , and Travis are n’t made from the same mold . ”
24863	24904	24908	24908	he	25	“ I ’ve always tried to be careful , tried not to draw attention to myself . I wanted to be a good wife to you , Max . I tried to change . I do n’t know what happened . ”
24957	24970	24971	24971	Max	25	“ Did you feel like you needed to change because of me ? ”
24979	25005	24971	24971	Max	25	“ Yes . No . I do n’t know . I wanted to be perfect . I slipped sometimes , did something stupid or thoughtless . ”
25030	25062	25063	25063	she	514	“ Every time I got a lecture from you , I tried to laugh it off , but I tried to do better . But you were just so damned perfect , ”
25093	25096	25075	25075	he	25	“ What ? ”
25127	25174	25122	25122	he	25	“ Sweetheart , I ’m far from perfect . Do you realize that I think we were both trying to fit the mold that we assumed was the other ’s ideal ? It would be even more fucking hilarious if it was n’t a little heartbreaking . ”
25208	25215	25216	25216	Max	25	“ Tell me what you did . ”
25254	25410	25419	25419	his	523	“ I waxed . I hated it , but I screamed my way through it , cursing the woman doing it in my head as a sadist . And I tried to stop being so clumsy . I got up every day and primped , even though I just wanted to wear a tank top without a bra and a crappy pair of shorts and get to work . I dieted , trying to be slender , feeling like I was starving to death most of the time . I stopped cursing because I thought it offended you , although I came close to slipping occasionally . I was raised with two brothers , and watching what I said was difficult . And I bought clothes because they were trendy , not because I liked them . I bit my tongue at parties , even when I did n’t agree with what people were saying . ”
25439	25687	25688	25688	he	524	“ One : I did n’t like the waxing , but if you wanted it , I did n’t care . Two : You ’re not clumsy — you’re absolutely adorable . I think I fell in love with you the moment you spilled your coffee on my favorite suit , which never did recover . But I got you out of the deal , so I did n’t give a shit about the suit . Three : All of your make - up was washed off when you jumped into the ocean last night , and your hair is wild like you ’ve been well - satisfied . And you take my breath away . I ’m all for the shorts and braless look , just know I might never leave the house after I see those incredible breasts . Four : You do n’t need to diet . Your figure was full and beautiful ; you ’re active and healthy . Most of the time , I was fighting for control . Five : I want you to wear whatever you want and be exactly who you are . If some uptight prick at a party pisses you off , tell him off . Six : I could n’t care less if you curse . Especially if you want to talk dirty to me . But know that I ’ll take you exactly where you happen to be at that moment if you do that , ”
25703	25759	25692	25692	He	524	“ I fell in love with you , Mia . I do n’t need you to be anyone other than who you are . I felt the distance growing after we were married , but I thought it was me . I was trying too hard to be the sensible man I assumed you wanted . ”
25770	25789	25692	25692	He	524	“ What did you do ? You told me about the trips to distance yourself . What else ? ”
25790	25886	25887	25887	he	526	“ I did a lot of little things , like shaving twice a day , but leaving was the worst part . It nearly killed me to leave , but I always felt like I needed to get a grip because you wanted a steady husband instead of a maniacal beast who was obsessed with the woman he loved . To me , you ’ve always been perfect , and I could never be good enough to deserve you . So instead , I ran away when I could n’t get my emotions under control , ”
25896	25942	25887	25887	he	526	“ I was n’t raised to show my emotions openly . And what I felt for you was n’t normal for me . I was terrified if you really knew how I felt … you’d run like hell . Most women would … or should . ”
25943	25992	25993	25993	Mia	26	“ I would n’t . I felt the same way , Max . I always have . But I guess I was convinced that you needed the perfect wife , and I was going to have to compromise or mold myself into that image to keep your love , ”
26007	26035	26036	26036	Max	25	“ You were worldly , sophisticated , and completely controlled . I did n’t want to smother you with emotion . And I felt … too much . ”
26062	26109	26041	26041	his	25	“ Suffocate me , Mia . Let me drown in your love and affection . Touch me . Shower me with your laughter . That ’s all I ’ve ever wanted . I need that from you . I just want to be close to you . ”
26117	26120	26121	26121	he	25	“ Please , ”
26199	26252	26253	26253	she	26	“ I think I ’ve grown up , Max . I ’m not sure what happened to me , but I do n’t want to change anymore . If you think you can handle me , I ’ll give you all the love I have and leave you begging for a reprieve , ”
26258	26275	26253	26253	she	26	“ And I love you a whole hell of a lot . Can you handle that ? ”
26290	26294	26281	26281	his	25	“ Oh yeah . ”
26342	26360	26339	26339	she	26	“ Love me just like this forever . It ’s all I ’ve ever wanted , too . ”
26372	26381	26363	26363	his	25	“ I will , sweetheart . I promise . ”
26556	26575	26576	26576	Sam	28	“ How damn long does it take to have a baby ? She ’s been in labor forever , ”
26642	26655	26658	26658	Helen	46	“ It ’s her first baby , Sam . It takes time , ”
26709	26721	26722	26722	Kade	29	“ Do you hate me for having some doubts at first ? ”
26730	26761	26762	26762	she	26	“ You ’re my brother . I love you . I was presumed dead . So no , I do n’t hate you because you did n’t immediately accept me , ”
26834	26925	26926	26926	Kade	29	“ I was an asshole . I knew it was you from the moment you criticized my shirt and called me by name in the park , but all I could think about was what would happen if Max got attached and something happened . He was a mess , Squirt . He walked around like an empty shell , like he did n’t care if he lived or died . Honestly , I do n’t think he did care . I did n’t want to see him suffer anymore , ”
26978	27008	26968	26968	She	26	“ I ’m twenty - nine years old , almost thirty . Do n’t you think it ’s time to stop referring to me by that stupid childhood nickname ? ”
27084	27093	27077	27077	Kade	29	“ Nope . You ’re still a squirt . ”
27094	27102	27103	27103	she	26	“ And you still wear bad shirts , ”
27252	27288	27246	27246	Kade	29	“ I just do n’t want you to think I ’m not happy to have you back . I am . More than I can say . But I was worried about Max , too . ”
27303	27310	27289	27289	She	26	“ I ’m glad . Really . ”
27335	27371	27372	27372	Kade	29	“ He loves you , Mia . It just sucks that now I ’ll have to put up with all three of them acting like idiots over their women , one of them my sister . ”
27398	27403	27404	27404	she	26	“ You ’ll survive , ”
27473	27481	27482	27482	Max	25	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
27520	27546	27547	27547	Kade	29	“ Squirt refuses to feel sorry for me because I have to deal with you , Sam , and Simon freaking out about your females , ”
27551	27562	27563	27563	Max	25	“ You ’re still on my shit list , buddy , ”
27570	27611	27563	27563	Max	25	“ I ’m offering a temporary truce because of the situation , but I still plan to pound you the first chance I get . If you said one word to upset her , I ’ll make you regret it . ”
27612	27622	27623	27623	Kade	29	“ Yeah . Let ’s see you try it , ”
27629	27645	27623	27623	Kade	29	“ I might have a lame leg , but I can still kick your ass . ”
27646	27663	27664	27664	Max	25	“ No mercy because of your leg . I ’m not going easy because of it , ”
27668	27673	27664	27664	Max	25	“ It ’s healed . ”
27674	27700	27701	27701	Kade	29	“ I did n’t expect you to . Give it your all . Just have an ambulance on standby when you decide to try it , ”
27743	27749	27750	27750	she	26	“ Both of you stop , ”
27753	27762	27763	27763	She	26	“ We ’re here for a happy occasion . ”
27769	27799	27805	27805	she	26	“ Kade was concerned about you . I do n’t blame him for that . I ’m glad he was trying to protect you , because I love you . ”
27813	27830	27805	27805	she	26	“ And you behave . You ’re deliberately provoking him , and it ’s not amusing . ”
27874	27882	27871	27871	Kade	29	“ Kiss and make up , man . ”
27897	27907	27908	27908	Max	25	“ Fine . I ’ll kick your ass later , ”
27942	27953	27954	27954	she	26	“ I ’m glad you two can act like adults , ”
27958	27965	27966	27966	Max	25	“ Do I have a choice ? ”
27975	27985	27966	27966	Max	25	“ Not if you want to get some later . ”
28002	28018	28019	28019	Mia	26	“ Sweetheart , for that , I ’d get down on my knees and beg . ”
28044	28060	28061	28061	Kade	29	“ Shit . Give me a break . TMI . She ’s my damn sister . ”
28073	28084	28061	28061	Kade	29	“ I ’m going for coffee . Anybody want anything ? ”
28085	28088	28089	28089	she	26	“ Coffee , ”
28105	28108	28109	28109	Mia	26	“ Addict , ”
28115	28123	28124	28124	he	25	“ I caught the addiction from you , ”
28173	28188	28189	28189	she	27	“ She ’s beautiful . Eight pounds , one ounce , and completely healthy , ”
28205	28209	28210	28210	Sam	28	“ Kara okay ? ”
28215	28226	28227	28227	Maddie	27	“ She ’s fine . Worn out , but good , ”
28230	28258	28259	28259	Mia	26	“ If I can tear him away , I ’ll get Simon to bring the baby out of the delivery room so you can all see her . ”
28266	28276	28259	28259	Mia	26	“ I ’m sure he ’s a proud daddy . ”
28277	28315	28316	28316	Maddie	27	“ He will be . He ’s a little green around the gills at the moment . I did n’t think he was going to make it through the delivery . Kara was calmer than he was , ”
28380	28387	28374	28374	he	25	“ Your turn next , buddy . ”
28407	28417	28418	28418	he	28	“ I do n’t think I can do it , ”
28428	28442	28443	28443	Maddie	27	“ You do n’t have to do it . I ’m doing it , ”
28447	28474	28443	28443	Maddie	27	“ Since everybody is here , I guess we can tell you all . Sam and I are being twice blessed . We ’re having twins . ”
28475	28479	28485	28485	his	25	“ Oh shit , ”
28600	28614	28615	28615	she	26	“ Congratulations , Maddie . We ’ll help the guys get through it , ”
28631	28637	28638	28638	Maddie	27	“ I just told Sam , ”
28645	28654	28638	28638	Maddie	27	“ He ’ll warm to the idea eventually . ”
28669	28673	28674	28674	they	591	“ Or not , ”
28746	28755	28756	28756	she	46	“ I wish I could have your baby , ”
28760	28787	28788	28788	Max	25	“ Sweetheart , you do n’t say something like that to me and not expect me to respond accordingly . I thought you wanted to wait , ”
28823	28836	28813	28813	she	26	“ I know we were waiting to have a family , but — ”
28837	28860	28861	28861	he	25	“ I ’m ready if you are . I think we ’ve waited long enough to start really living our lives together , ”
28873	28878	28879	28879	she	26	“ Me , too , ”
28946	28959	28960	28960	she	26	“ When I recover my memory , we can talk about it , ”
28963	28984	28960	28960	she	26	“ We do need some time after all that ’s happened , but it would be nice to plan it . ”
28985	28999	29000	29000	Max	25	“ I ’ll be more than happy to do my part to help , ”
29020	29041	29042	29042	she	26	“ You ’ll be my stud once I know what happened and we know everything is going to be okay ? ”
29046	29068	29069	29069	he	25	“ Baby , I am your stud . The only one you ’ll ever need . And everything will be fine , ”
29073	29087	29090	29090	him	25	“ We ca n’t exactly get started immediately , but you could practice , ”
29158	29171	29172	29172	she	26	“ You have condoms in the car ? You really are prepared , ”
29184	29191	29192	29192	he	25	“ I was a Boy Scout , ”
29304	29325	29326	29326	she	26	“ No ! Do n’t hurt him . I ’ll do whatever you want . Just leave my family alone , ”
29351	29400	29401	29401	He	187	“ Easy shot . A few hundred yards . I could take him out in less than ten seconds and then go pick off both your brothers , too , before anybody even realizes what happened . The security of these rich pukes is n’t worth a shit . ”
29424	29436	29414	29415	a sharpshooter	611	“ You wo n’t get away with it . The police — ”
29437	29476	29477	29477	he	187	“ Wo n’t do you a damn bit of good after they ’re dead . And I doubt they ’ll pay much attention before that . Everyone knows about the crazy Harrisons . They ’ll never find me , ”
29481	29490	29501	29501	he	187	“ Are you willing to take that chance ? ”
29505	29548	29501	29501	he	187	“ You do n’t love any of them , Mia . Not like you love me . You want me . You married that rich suit as a substitute . I ’m here now . Cooperate and we can be together again . ”
29561	29569	29549	29549	She	26	“ What do you want , Danny ? ”
29570	29581	29582	29582	he	187	“ You . We belong together . We always have , ”
29587	29592	29593	29593	she	26	“ And my money , ”
29648	29660	29629	29629	he	187	“ That ’s just a side benefit . I love you . ”
29890	29902	29903	29903	he	50	“ I can think of a better use for that mouth , ”
29935	29945	29910	29910	He	50	“ Suck me . You know you want to . ”
30430	30434	30435	30435	he	25	“ Miss me ? ”
30445	30458	30435	30435	he	25	“ You should have woken me up and taken me with you . ”
30552	30561	30562	30562	she	26	“ Bad dream . I was all sweaty , ”
30577	30595	30603	30603	he	25	“ Then you definitely should have woken me up . I love being all sweaty with you . ”
30622	30629	30603	30603	he	25	“ Hey . Are you okay ? ”
30630	30638	30639	30639	she	26	“ Yeah . I ’m good now , ”
31108	31116	31119	31119	He	25	“ Mia . I wo n’t last . ”
31330	31337	31338	31338	he	25	“ Come with me , Mia , ”
31369	31374	31350	31350	she	26	“ Come with me . ”
31566	31569	31570	31570	he	25	“ Shit , ”
31586	31589	31590	31590	he	25	“ Mia , ”
31668	31678	31679	31679	Kade	29	“ This better be important . It ’s early , ”
31687	31692	31693	31693	Max	25	“ Mia ’s missing , ”
31698	31703	31693	31693	Max	25	“ Is she there ? ”
31704	31720	31721	31721	Kade	29	“ Hell no , she ’s not here . I was sleeping . What happened ? ”
31737	31759	31728	31728	Max	25	“ Nothing happened . She ’s just not here . Nobody saw her leave . Neither of the cars is missing . ”
31788	31796	31797	31797	Max	25	“ Hold on . I found something , ”
31874	31879	31880	31880	Max	25	“ What the fuck ? ”
31898	31904	31905	31905	Kade	29	“ What ? What happened ? ”
31913	31931	31932	31932	Max	25	“ She ’s left me . On purpose . She does n’t want to be married anymore , ”
31958	31961	31962	31962	Kade	29	“ Bullshit , ”
31970	31983	31962	31962	Kade	29	“ She ’s in love with you . You know she is . ”
31984	31998	31999	31999	Max	25	“ I ca n’t make her stay if she does n’t want to , ”
32009	32024	31999	31999	Max	25	“ She never wanted to be with me . She just did n’t remember . ”
32025	32056	32057	32057	Kade	29	“ You never gave up on her , man . Not once . Do n’t give up now . There ’s something going on that we do n’t know about , ”
32075	32109	32110	32110	Max	25	“ Nobody forced her to write that note . Nobody is forcing her to leave . She made her fucking choice . Twice . Obviously she remembered that she did n’t love me , ”
32176	32200	32201	32201	Kade	29	“ Max , you know her . You know this is n’t Mia . We need to figure out what ’s going on , ”
32249	32262	32263	32263	he	25	“ Truth is , maybe I never really knew her at all , ”
32466	32471	32462	32462	he	29	“ Where is she ? ”
32487	32490	32481	32481	he	31	“ Who ? ”
32491	32494	32495	32495	Kade	29	“ Mia , ”
32559	32582	32585	32585	he	29	“ She could n’t have done this alone . And there ’s only one person I know who could pull this off . ”
32653	32673	32674	32674	Travis	31	“ Two disappearances with no sign of her ? Where is she , Travis ? This is killing Max . ”
32689	32701	32674	32674	Travis	31	“ What do you mean … two ? She ’s back . ”
32702	32708	32709	32709	Kade	29	“ She ’s gone again , ”
32762	32776	32777	32777	Travis	31	“ Shit . I brought her back . Did she recover her memory ? ”
32791	32800	32801	32801	Kade	29	“ Yeah . What difference does that make ? ”
32805	32843	32844	32844	Travis	31	“ It makes all the difference . I have something I needed to tell her as soon as her memory returned . I needed to tell her not to run . She does n’t have to anymore , ”
32869	32878	32866	32866	he	29	“ You helped her disappear the first time ? ”
32879	32882	32866	32866	he	29	“ Yes . ”
32883	32895	32866	32866	he	29	“ And you did n’t tell me she was n’t dead ? ”
32929	32932	32913	32913	Travis	31	“ Why ? ”
32933	32972	32973	32973	Travis	31	“ She was in trouble . Her life was in danger and so were yours and Max ’s . If keeping my mouth shut to keep everyone alive was what I had to do … I did it . ”
32992	33030	32973	32973	Travis	31	“ Do you think it was easy for me not to say anything , to watch everyone grieve ? Contrary to what you might think , brother … I do n’t enjoy seeing you or Max suffer . ”
33031	33047	33066	33066	he	31	“ You were n’t close to Max ; you did n’t see how much he — ”
33048	33054	33055	33055	Travis	31	“ Because I could n’t , ”
33092	33103	33085	33085	Kade	29	“ Tell me everything . And start at the beginning . ”
33104	33152	33153	33153	Travis	31	“ We do n’t have time for that right now . I ’ll tell you everything later . We need to find Mia . She has to be scared . She does n’t know the man who was threatening everyone ’s life is no longer a problem . ”
33179	33185	33186	33186	Kade	29	“ And why is that ? ”
33196	33201	33202	33202	Travis	31	“ He ’s dead , ”
33208	33212	33202	33202	Travis	31	“ Unfortunate accident . ”
33213	33228	33229	33229	Kade	29	“ You should have shared this with me . You ’re my goddamn brother , ”
33293	33322	33280	33280	Travis	31	“ Why ? What would you have done ? Gone to find her , thinking we could protect her ? Told Max so he could go find her ? ”
33323	33338	33280	33280	Travis	31	“ Probably . She did n’t need to do this . We have security — ”
33339	33350	33351	33351	Travis	31	“ Agents who failed to protect her from a madman , ”
33357	33442	33443	33443	Travis	31	“ Max was gone , you were gone … and I was left to make a decision . So I made it . So go ahead … beat the shit out of me for trying to protect our little sister , for never wanting to see her debased and abused again . Had you or Max gone after her , she would have never stayed hidden , never been safe . I ’ll live with your hatred if it means you ’re all alive , ”
33489	33519	33520	33520	Kade	29	“ I suppose I need to hear you out . I want to know what happened . You ’ll tell me about it on our way to find Mia , ”
33583	33601	33602	33602	Travis	31	“ I ’m pretty sure I know where she is . We ’ll have awhile to talk . ”
33622	33651	33652	33652	Kade	29	“ That ’s probably the most butt - ugly shirt I ’ve ever seen on you . Congratulations on topping the puke green one with the ugly frogs . ”
33655	33663	33664	33664	He	29	“ I knew you ’d like it . ”
33675	33684	33685	33685	Travis	31	“ Are you ever going to grow up ? ”
33695	33703	33685	33685	Travis	31	“ Not if I can help it . ”
33718	33740	33685	33685	Travis	31	“ You ’re changing your shirt , right ? I ’m not traveling with you if you ’re wearing that shirt . ”
33741	33761	33762	33762	Kade	29	“ Sure . I can change . We just have to stop by my house after we tell Max , ”
33769	33790	33791	33791	Travis	31	“ I can pick up some extra clothes if we ’re going to be gone overnight to go get Mia . ”
33795	33798	33791	33791	Travis	31	“ Good . ”
35288	35296	35297	35297	she	26	“ Now he ’ll really hate me , ”
35594	35597	35598	35598	she	26	“ No ! ”
35611	35636	35598	35598	she	26	“ You ca n’t talk to him ever again . You need to separate yourself from him completely . You ’re dangerous to him . ”
36154	36167	36145	36145	he	25	“ Open the door , Mia . I know you ’re there . ”
36323	36328	36318	36318	he	25	“ king of the world ”
36330	36336	36318	36318	he	25	“ emperor of the dumbasses . ”
36337	36345	36346	36346	Mia	26	“ Max … have you been drinking ? ”
36359	36366	36367	36367	Max	25	“ I ’ve had a few , ”
36521	36527	36528	36528	she	221	“ You never drink much , ”
36538	36546	36528	36528	she	221	“ And you never drink and drive . ”
36585	36615	36623	36623	he	25	“ Did n’t drive while I was drinking — except up your driveway , which , by the way , has a hell of a lot of damn potholes . ”
36656	36664	36665	36665	Mia	26	“ You ’re completely plastered , Max , ”
36679	36686	36674	36674	her	26	“ How much did you drink ? ”
36687	36692	36693	36693	he	25	“ Do n’t know , ”
36751	36760	36761	36761	she	26	“ How did you know I was here ? ”
36765	36781	36782	36782	he	25	“ Your brothers . I ’m not sure … but I think I killed Travis , ”
36814	36842	36843	36843	she	26	“ You did n’t kill my brother , and you should n’t have gotten in a fight with him . He ’s just trying to protect me , ”
36860	36876	36843	36843	she	26	“ Is that how you got that cut over your eye ? It ’s bleeding . ”
36903	36918	36919	36919	Max	25	“ Yeah ? If you think I look bad , you should see him , ”
36941	36948	36949	36949	he	25	“ He fights like a girl , ”
36986	37014	37015	37015	Mia	26	“ Bastard should have told me . You ’re my goddamn wife . I had a right to know that you ’d left me for another man . ”
37027	37041	37015	37015	Mia	26	“ Oh , Max . What did they say ? That is n’t — ”
37042	37063	37064	37064	Max	25	“ I want to hate you . I should hate you . But dammit , I just fucking ca n’t , ”
37122	37151	37154	37154	they	797	“ Did you know that when I thought you were dead , I wanted to die too ? I did n’t want to go on living without you . ”
37173	37213	37214	37214	He	25	“ I was completely obsessed with you , so out of control that I had to back away from it to keep a leash on myself . And the whole fucking time , your mind was on another man . ”
37285	37297	37282	37282	her	798	“ I ’m not sure what my brothers said , but — ”
37298	37366	37367	37367	Max	25	“ They told me you left me because of another man . They told me that you ’d been hiding out in Montana at your grandmother ’s ranch . All this fucking time , you ’ve been alive and content in another state , happily living your life while I tormented myself with thoughts that you were dead , that I ’d never fucking see you again , ”
37401	37418	37419	37419	he	25	“ Why marry me ? It was n’t like you did n’t have your own money , ”
37439	37458	37459	37459	She	799	“ And where the hell is this other guy ? Did you run away from him , too ? ”
37482	37498	37469	37469	her	799	“ I married you because I loved you . I did n’t want anyone else . ”
37765	37768	37755	37755	I	0	“ Fuck . ”
37789	37807	37777	37777	he	25	“ What the hell am I doing ? I must have some kind of secret masochistic tendencies . ”
37854	37861	37862	37862	she	26	“ I think you need coffee , ”
37873	37878	37879	37879	he	25	“ I need you , ”
38057	38060	38061	38061	Mia	26	“ Max ? ”
38127	38148	38149	38149	she	26	“ Not enough to kill him , but he ’s going to have a pretty horrible hangover in the morning , ”
38178	38181	38182	38182	she	26	“ Tucker , ”
38266	38269	38270	38270	Mia	26	“ Come , ”
38318	38341	38342	38342	she	26	“ He ’s drunk . I did n’t do it . I was n’t there . Why did n’t you stop him ? ”
38533	38540	38541	38541	she	26	“ He hates me , Tucker , ”
38564	38573	38541	38541	she	26	“ And he thinks I had another man . ”
38697	38700	38701	38701	Max	25	“ Mia , ”
38726	38730	38731	38731	he	25	“ Come back , ”
38761	38764	38765	38765	She	26	“ Max ? ”
38807	38810	38811	38811	he	25	“ Mia , ”
38822	38832	38833	38833	she	26	“ Wake up , Max . You ’re dreaming , ”
38878	38883	38884	38884	he	25	“ You ’re here , ”
38896	38901	38902	38902	she	26	“ I ’m here , ”
38951	38957	38958	38958	he	25	“ Where are we going ? ”
38968	38976	38977	38977	she	26	“ I ’m putting you to bed , ”
38999	39004	39005	39005	he	25	“ No argument here , ”
39021	39032	39005	39005	he	25	“ You ’re wearing my ring . You found it . ”
39126	39134	39135	39135	she	26	“ I am . I love it , ”
39407	39413	39414	39414	he	25	“ Having problems , sweetheart ? ”
39429	39435	39426	39426	she	26	“ Take off your jeans . ”
39452	39463	39464	39464	he	25	“ I liked it better when you were doing it , ”
39545	39548	39549	39549	he	25	“ Off , ”
39561	39564	39565	39565	she	26	“ On , ”
39634	39639	39640	39640	he	25	“ I ’m lonely , ”
39668	39673	39674	39674	he	25	“ I love you , ”
39678	39689	39674	39674	he	25	“ Come here next to me . I miss you . ”
39932	39939	39940	39940	she	26	“ I love you , too , ”
40171	40182	40166	40166	she	26	“ Max ! Where in the hell is my sister ? ”
40287	40298	40280	40280	He	25	“ No screaming . My head is ready to explode . ”
40311	40316	40317	40317	Kade	29	“ Nobody was yelling , ”
40326	40336	40317	40317	Kade	29	“ Jesus Christ , you must have gotten pickled . ”
40337	40342	40343	40343	Travis	31	“ Coffee and aspirin , ”
40355	40372	40373	40373	Kade	29	“ You look like hell , buddy . What the hell happened ? Where is Mia ? ”
40431	40436	40437	40437	He	25	“ Is she gone ? ”
40579	40601	40602	40602	Kade	29	“ Well , she ’s not here . And a truck that I assume is hers is still in the driveway . ”
40609	40626	40602	40602	Kade	29	“ She had a rental car . She must have picked it up at the airport . ”
40644	40650	40651	40651	Kade	29	“ Then she ’s gone , ”
40655	40659	40651	40651	Kade	29	“ Damn it . ”
40660	40674	40675	40675	Max	25	“ I ’ll stay away from her . Maybe she ’ll stop running . ”
40706	40720	40721	40721	Kade	29	“ She is n’t running from you , man . She ’s scared , ”
40725	40729	40730	40730	Max	25	“ Of what ? ”
40752	40784	40735	40735	He	25	“ Long story that you need to hear . Take a shower , for God ’s sake . You smell like a damn distillery . Since when do you get drunk ? ”
40806	40819	40820	40820	Max	25	“ Since your sister decided to leave me again for another man , ”
40839	40848	40849	40849	Kade	29	“ We need to get one thing straight . ”
40854	40962	40849	40849	Kade	29	“ My sister loves you . I have no idea why . Personally , I think you ’re a real asshole to wake up to , but she ’s obviously blind to that . She did n’t leave you for another man . She left you because of one . There ’s a big difference . If you would have stayed to hear Travis out instead of trying to kill him , you ’d know the truth by now . Take a shower and meet us in the living room before you piss me off and I take a shot at the other side of your face . ”
41148	41151	41152	41152	Max	25	“ Traitor , ”
41225	41253	41254	41254	he	29	“ I do n’t know where she went . I did get drunk , and we … talked . She was here when I went to sleep , ”
41258	41299	41254	41254	he	29	“ I do n’t know why she left and I do n’t know where she went . She ran . Again . It ’s something Mia seems to excel at doing . I assume there was no note this time ? ”
41300	41309	41310	41310	Kade	29	“ Nothing . How much do you remember ? ”
41323	41328	41329	41329	Max	25	“ Not a lot , ”
41333	41370	41329	41329	Max	25	“ I remember her being here when I went to sleep . I have a few empty spaces in my memory of last night . I ’m not sure what was real and what I imagined . ”
41385	41397	41398	41398	Kade	29	“ Welcome to ‘ the morning after , ’ Mr. Perfect , ”
41402	41439	41398	41398	Kade	29	“ I just wish I could have been here to see it . The ‘ always in control Max Hamilton ’ three sheets to the wind ? I would have paid good money for that show . ”
41440	41450	41451	41451	Max	25	“ No reruns . It was an exclusive showing , ”
41493	41499	41482	41491	some kind of mythological monster with razor - sharp teeth	847	“ Tell me about Mia . ”
41518	41523	41482	41491	some kind of mythological monster with razor - sharp teeth	847	“ Is she safe ? ”
41524	41576	41577	41577	Travis	31	“ I have a team of investigators tracking her as we speak . I should have a location on her shortly . She ’s obviously headed back to the airport . She hired the rental she got from there and there are n’t many other means of transport away from here . ”
41618	41706	41607	41607	his	31	“ To make a long story short , she got involved in a bad relationship back when she was in college . The asshole finally got put in jail and we thought it was over . He got out of prison right before Mia disappeared the first time , threatening to kill you , Kade , and me if she did n’t come back to him . She was afraid … and I helped her . She ’s my sister . Her safety was my main concern . ”
41707	41727	41728	41728	Max	25	“ She was my goddamn wife . Why did n’t you tell me ? I could have protected her , ”
41740	41782	41783	41783	Travis	31	“ You were unavailable . In fact , Danny had Mia in his grasp when your plane took off , your head in the sight of a rifle and ready to blow your head off . Your wife saved your life , ”
41787	41842	41783	41783	Travis	31	“ Danny Harvey was a career criminal , completely insane , and ready to do whatever it took to get Mia back . He was also a sharpshooter who could pick off a target at long distances . He won a lot of competitions when he was young . He rarely missed a target . ”
41843	41860	41861	41861	Max	25	“ Why was Mia even with him ? She could n’t have loved someone like that , ”
41868	41932	41865	41865	Kade	29	“ She was twenty - one years old , had an old man who was a raging alcoholic and completely insane . He beat his wife and children often and repeatedly . Mia suffered under my father ’s hand . We all did . Do you really think she even knew what love was ? Do you think she knew what normal was ? ”
41944	42002	41933	41933	Kade	29	“ I was gone , you were gone , and Travis was the only thing standing between her and him . I was pissed off , too , Max , when I found out he ’d been responsible for hiding her . But I might have done the same damn thing if it meant keeping Mia safe . ”
42003	42016	42017	42017	Max	25	“ You should have told me . I thought she was dead . ”
42030	42041	42023	42023	She	849	“ All those years , I fucking grieved for her . ”
42042	42102	42103	42103	Travis	31	“ It was n’t a picnic for her either . Do you think she wanted to go ? She was terrified he ’d kill you . She ran to keep you safe . She did n’t give a shit about what happened to her . I can testify to that because I saw the way he messed her up . ”
42109	42118	42103	42103	Travis	31	“ Back in college and before she disappeared . ”
42119	42128	42129	42129	Max	25	“ You knew when she was in college ? ”
42133	42245	42129	42129	Max	25	“ Not immediately . She went to Virginia to go to college . My father wanted her to go to business school in Florida and get involved in the business , but that was n’t what Mia wanted . Gran made jewelry when she was alive , and that ’s what Mia wanted to do . Mia had this house and her trust as an inheritance , but she did n’t have control of anything yet . She had to bury herself in student loans that she could pay back later to attend the college in Virginia that had the BFA and MFA that she wanted to become a jewelry designer . ”
42259	42307	42308	42308	Travis	31	“ Kade and I were both in school too , but once I finished my business degree and was working , I decided to go to Virginia to surprise Mia . I ended up more surprised than she was when I saw what was happening to her . ”
42321	42325	42308	42308	Travis	31	“ What happened ? ”
42346	42352	42326	42326	Max	25	“ Did he hurt her ? ”
42353	42356	42357	42357	Travis	31	“ Yeah , ”
42360	42442	42357	42357	Travis	31	“ Pretty badly right about the time I went to visit . But even through all that bullshit , she was working part - time and pulling excellent grades . She was about ready to enter her master ’s program . And he was trying to convince her not to — with his fists . He did n’t want her accumulating more loans . The bastard wanted plenty of that trust fund left when she was able to get to it . ”
42443	42446	42447	42447	Max	25	“ Fuck ! ”
42466	42475	42461	42462	any man	852	“ How did she separate herself from him ? ”
42476	42513	42514	42514	Travis	31	“ She did n’t have to . He went to jail . I think she ’d been trying to get away from the relationship for a while , but he really did a number on her , ”
42540	42546	42547	42547	Max	25	“ What were the charges ? ”
42563	42573	42574	42574	Travis	31	“ Assault with a deadly weapon . Nasty ordeal , ”
42579	42585	42586	42586	Max	25	“ You set him up , ”
42603	42624	42591	42591	Travis	31	“ I went to have a discussion with him . Let ’s just say I made sure there were witnesses . ”
42625	42630	42631	42631	Max	25	“ Did Mia know ? ”
42650	42653	42654	42654	Travis	31	“ No , ”
42658	42695	42654	42654	Travis	31	“ She had her studies and her job to worry about . All she ever knew was that he was going to jail , and she was safe . It was all she needed to know . ”
42730	42735	42736	42736	Max	25	“ And last time ? ”
42746	42853	42854	42854	Travis	31	“ He took her by surprise when she was leaving her car in a parking lot . She had dismissed your security , telling them she was going to be with Kade and me , and had our security . She told them to take some time off because she did n’t want them following her around town on errands . Danny had her in his vehicle before she even realized what happened . It was the morning you left , and he took her to an area near your jet , forced her to watch while he showed her how easily he could kill you , ”
42882	43110	43111	43111	Travis	31	“ She ’s a smart woman . She told him she would go with him , gave him everything he wanted to hear , but she said she needed a day to take care of some things first . She finally convinced him to let her go by herself by telling him she needed to arrange things to get to her trust fund . Somehow , she convinced him to meet her the next morning , making him think she wanted to go with him . I do n’t think she wanted to even tell me , but she asked for my help and I was n’t going to refuse her . We set up the stuff at the beach , hoping she would be assumed dead , and I got her away from Tampa as fast as I could . I wanted to tell you , Max . And I wanted Kade to know she was alive . I just was n’t entirely sure how either of you would react . I could n’t risk leaving any trail to Mia . This man was psychotic , probably more deranged than my father and a hundred times more dangerous . I wanted her safe and needed time to track his ass down . I never realized that it would take over two years to find the bastard , ”
43114	43120	43111	43111	Travis	31	“ What about the police ? ”
43183	43273	43164	43164	Kade	29	“ Our father was a nut case . Do you have any idea how many times the police were at our house for a domestic dispute , usually reported by neighbors ? The Harrison family was notorious , and not in a good way . Do you really think they would have taken her seriously ? They would have done their job , but it would have alerted Danny , and it probably would n’t have stopped him . There is n’t a lot they can do with stalkers . ”
43274	43280	43281	43281	Max	25	“ But he hurt her , ”
43291	43329	43330	43330	Travis	31	“ No witnesses . No proof that he was to blame . They would n’t have had any evidence to immediately arrest him . Do you really think we could be totally certain that she was safe ? ”
43334	43388	43330	43330	Travis	31	“ I ’m sorry , Max . But I was n’t taking that chance with my baby sister or Kade . She needed to disappear for a while until I could track him down . Had I known the bastard was getting out of prison early , I would have had him tailed . ”
43389	43409	43437	43437	his	25	“ For over two fucking years ? You should have told me . She was my wife to protect . ”
43410	43421	43422	43422	Travis	31	“ She was my sister before she was your wife , ”
43427	43433	43434	43434	Max	25	“ I did n’t know , ”
43443	43465	43437	43437	his	25	“ She never told me . I should have known she was in danger . I should have known about him . ”
43504	43512	43513	43513	Kade	29	“ You ’re not psychic , buddy , ”
43516	43555	43513	43513	Kade	29	“ She obviously did n’t want to talk about it . I never knew either . And he had been in jail for years . Nobody could predict what he was going to do when he got out . ”
43556	43603	43604	43604	Max	25	“ I was busy running away from how I felt about her , and she was trying to make herself into a perfect wife . It was n’t all her fault . I was n’t exactly accessible . I was n’t really ‘ seeing ’ her , ”
43693	43701	43702	43702	Kade	29	“ And if you had seen her ? ”
43709	43761	43706	43706	Max	25	“ I would have loved her the same way . But I might have been able to allow her to be who she was and not try to please me . Maybe I would have pulled my head out of my ass long enough to realize that she needed me too . ”
43808	43819	43820	43820	he	25	“ Damn secretary has been playing with my phone again , ”
43845	43851	43852	43852	Kade	29	“ Do n’t blame Travis , ”
43856	43910	43852	43852	Kade	29	“ Growing up with my father was n’t easy , and he was trying to protect Mia . We grew up trying to protect her from my father . Travis might have been a bit misguided , but Mia begged him not to tell anyone . She was afraid for all of us . ”
43911	43918	43919	43919	Max	25	“ I do n’t . Much , ”
43929	43953	43954	43954	he	25	“ I should have known more about her past , protected her myself . But that bastard is mine . He ’s dead , ”
43962	43968	43969	43969	Kade	29	“ He ’s already dead , ”
43973	44064	43969	43969	Kade	29	“ That ’s why we ’ve been trying to talk to Mia . When she lost her memory , obviously Travis could n’t say anything . But he needed her to know that Danny ’s dead . She ’s on the run because she does n’t know . She ’s still trying to protect us . I know she left that note and ran again to try to protect you . She loves you , Max . If you do n’t understand anything else , you have to know that . ”
44065	44075	44076	44076	Max	25	“ The guy is dead . Was it Travis ? ”
44109	44134	44135	44135	He	29	“ He wo n’t admit it . He says he finally tracked Danny down in Colorado and went to have a talk with him . ”
44145	44226	44142	44142	he	29	“ We know exactly what kind of ‘ talks ’ Travis would have when someone threatens his family . He says Danny fled before he could even get his hands on him . Travis got in his car and chased him down some winding mountain road and Danny made a fatal driving error . Danny ’s car went over the side of the mountain . Travis confirmed he was dead before he sent his guys to escort Mia back home . ”
44274	44279	44280	44280	Max	25	“ Travis outmaneuvered him , ”
44287	44291	44284	44284	Kade	29	“ You think ? ”
44292	44323	44324	44324	Kade	29	“ I ’m glad the bastard is dead . I just regret not having a chance at him myself . I ’d tear his fucking head off for hurting Mia . ”
44330	44367	44324	44324	Kade	29	“ You know , you get less and less like Mr. Perfect every day . You ’re starting to sound pretty brutal . What happened to the calm , smooth , and completely controlled Max Hamilton ? ”
44368	44384	44385	44385	Max	25	“ Never had any control when it comes to Mia . She makes me crazy , ”
44406	44421	44385	44385	Max	25	“ Why did n’t Travis contact her once Danny was dead and tell her ? ”
44422	44531	44324	44324	Kade	29	“ He had agents keeping an eye on her . He tried to call a few times after Danny died , but she did n’t answer . They had n’t had any contact since she left . He sent her money in a convoluted way so nobody could track it , money that she barely touched the whole time she was here . Travis did n’t want anyone to link the two of them together in any way . This house was left to Mia by Gran , along with her funds in trust , but I know I did n’t even think about it . Did you ? ”
44542	44616	44539	44539	Kade	29	“ Travis sent his guys in to pick Mia up when he could n’t reach her by phone and bring her home . He wanted to meet her at the jet to tell her , but he had some critical meeting that he could n’t get out of . When he got home , she was n’t there . She must have got to his place and left for the park almost immediately . ”
44617	44631	44632	44632	Max	25	“ Why was she there ? Did she know we ’d be there ? ”
44648	44683	44684	44684	Kade	29	“ I ’m not sure . My guess is she saw the invitation from Sam on Travis ’ cupboard . He said it was in the kitchen on the table when he got home . ”
44690	44733	44684	44684	Kade	29	“ It ’s the only thing that makes sense . Her shorter hair and the hair color were probably things she did before she left Montana . She did n’t know Danny was dead and probably wanted to keep a low profile . ”
44734	44740	44741	44741	Max	25	“ She came for me , ”
44758	44773	44741	44741	Max	25	“ She knew I would probably be there since Sam was hosting the picnic . ”
44774	44785	44786	44786	Kade	29	“ Nah … I think she was looking for me , ”
44803	44820	44796	44796	Max	25	“ Or maybe not , since she was staring at you with a nauseatingly lovesick look . ”
44821	44836	44837	44837	Max	25	“ She seemed … different after the accident . Still Mia , but more … ”
44850	44853	44847	44847	he	25	“ whole . ”
44897	44944	44945	44945	Kade	29	“ I do n’t think it was the accident that changed her . She went through counseling while she was here in Montana . It was her deal with Travis . He made her promise she ’d find someone to talk to , try to heal , ”
44950	45002	44945	44945	Kade	29	“ I think maybe it helped . I did n’t get to see her often because I was on the road so much after I started college , but she seemed different to how she had been when she was younger . Like she was more comfortable in her own skin . ”
45018	45037	45015	45015	he	31	“ She ’s at the airport . She bought herself a one - way ticket to Los Angeles . ”
45038	45044	45045	45045	Max	25	“ What the hell for ? ”
45049	45062	45063	45063	Travis	31	“ She ’s on the run . It ’s a big city , ”
45066	45079	45063	45063	Travis	31	“ She ’s going to try to get lost in a crowd . ”
45080	45089	45115	45115	he	29	“ When ? Do you have the info ? ”
45101	45107	45108	45108	Kade	29	“ What time is it ? ”
45120	45128	45115	45115	he	29	“ I did n’t bring my cell . ”
45145	45157	45129	45129	Travis	31	“ It ’s nine . Her flight leaves at eleven thirty . ”
45165	45191	45192	45192	he	25	“ I ’ve got this . You two can go home . It ’s time for my wife and me to come to an understanding , ”
45196	45201	45202	45202	he	25	“ No more interference , ”
45223	45253	45213	45213	Travis	31	“ Agreed . Do n’t ever hurt her , and I wo n’t have to kill you . She ’s been through enough , Max . Make her happy . ”
45320	45328	45329	45329	Travis	31	“ Thanks for messing up my face . ”
45332	45335	45329	45329	Travis	31	“ Likewise . ”
45362	45371	45372	45372	Max	25	“ I ’ll change clothes in the car . ”
45426	45432	45433	45433	Kade	29	“ Need a clean shirt ? ”
45437	45442	45433	45433	Kade	29	“ I have extras . ”
45489	45504	45505	45505	he	25	“ Hell no . I do want her to actually come back to me , ”
45521	45529	45505	45505	he	25	“ Hey … Mia loves my shirts , ”
45908	45928	45929	45929	Mia	26	“ You have to the count of ten to get that beautiful ass up and out of this plane . ”
45965	45968	45958	45958	his	25	“ Max ? ”
45994	46012	45973	45973	his	25	“ You have to get off this plane . We ’re going to be taking off soon . ”
46013	46016	46018	46018	his	25	“ One . ”
46025	46036	46018	46018	his	25	“ Max . Stop this . You need to go . ”
46095	46098	46099	46099	He	25	“ Two . ”
46157	46181	46151	46151	she	26	“ I ’m leaving you , Max . I do n’t want to be with you anymore . I do n’t love you . ”
46246	46249	46233	46233	she	26	“ Three . ”
46339	46347	46348	46348	She	26	“ I ’m not going , Max . ”
46355	46358	46348	46348	She	26	“ Four . ”
46380	46393	46377	46377	his	25	“ Do n’t make this harder than it already is . Please . ”
46445	46448	46428	46428	his	25	“ Ten . ”
46489	46500	46507	46507	he	25	“ Let go . Dammit . What are you doing ? ”
46600	46608	46594	46594	she	26	“ What happened to counting to ten ? ”
46609	46619	46620	46620	he	25	“ Took too long . You talked too much , ”
46662	46672	46673	46673	she	26	“ I bet I would have gotten a ticket , ”
46746	46771	46772	46772	she	26	“ You do understand that you just kidnapped me . Last I knew , it ’s illegal to take a woman without her permission , ”
46780	46790	46791	46791	Max	25	“ How did you get through security , anyway ? ”
46794	46803	46791	46791	Max	25	“ I bought a ticket on the flight . ”
46846	46866	46829	46829	He	25	“ I do not want to go back to the ranch . I need to be on that plane . ”
46867	46873	46874	46874	Max	25	“ No you do n’t , ”
46880	46907	46874	46874	Max	25	“ Danny ’s dead . And you ’re never running away from me again . I ’ll make sure to give you every reason to stay . ”
46945	46953	46933	46933	Mia	26	“ How do you know about him ? ”
46954	46957	46958	46958	Max	25	“ Travis , ”
46970	46981	46967	46967	his	25	“ Why did n’t you ever tell me , Mia ? ”
46982	47019	47020	47020	she	26	“ I thought it was all over , and I wanted to leave it in the past . I did n’t think you ’d understand a woman being that stupid . What did Travis tell you ? ”
47056	47091	47092	47092	Max	25	“ He told me everything . Your relationship in college and the abuse , Danny nearly killing me , you saving my life . And you are not stupid . Did Travis miss anything ? ”
47106	47111	47112	47112	Mia	26	“ It ’s over , ”
47224	47243	47244	47244	Max	25	“ Your running days are over , sweetheart , but you and me … we’ll never be over , ”
47249	47268	47244	47244	Max	25	“ Not unless you ’ve really stopped loving me , and you really want it to be over . ”
47269	47287	47288	47288	Mia	26	“ But the woman you fell in love with does n’t exist . She never really did , ”
47293	47303	47288	47288	Mia	26	“ For me she did and she still does . ”
47330	47396	47397	47397	Max	25	“ I did n’t care about the superficial things . It did n’t matter what you wore , what you said to other people , or what was in your past . I fell in love with you , the you who was always there and still is , no matter how much you twisted yourself to fit an image I never really cared about . ”
47408	47481	47397	47397	Max	25	“ I want to know everything about you now . Maybe it was my fault because I put you on a pedestal instead of treating you like my woman . I thought you were perfect , but I would have felt that way regardless . Even if I ’d known about your past , your insecurities , your personal preferences , I still would have fucking worshipped the ground you walked on . ”
47482	47485	47486	47486	she	919	“ Why ? ”
47490	47539	47540	47540	Max	25	“ I was a screwed - up woman who put up with a highly abusive relationship for over a year . My self - confidence was nil , and I never felt like I was good enough for you , or enough of a woman to keep you . ”
47552	47580	47540	47540	Max	25	“ I ca n’t be the same man I was before either , Mia . The love was real , but we were both pretending , hiding . ”
47581	47585	47586	47586	she	919	“ What now ? ”
47613	47665	47598	47598	Max	25	“ Now I plan to show my wife exactly how I feel about her , love her the way I ’ve always loved her but was too afraid to show it . We trust each other instead of running away . We strip each other bare in more ways than one . ”
47679	47697	47698	47698	she	919	“ I trust you . I always have . It was myself who I did n’t trust , ”
47748	47755	47756	47756	Max	25	“ Fuck . I need you , ”
47827	47830	47831	47831	he	25	“ Key , ”
47835	47851	47852	47852	she	919	“ In the plant . I can see it . Were Kade and Travis here ? ”
47856	47859	47852	47852	she	919	“ Yeah . ”
47860	47870	47871	47871	Max	25	“ They did n’t even bother to hide it . ”
47918	47953	47904	47904	he	25	“ I want you naked right now . I need you wanting me and moaning my name . I want to feel every emotion you have while I fuck you until you ’re satisfied . ”
47954	47959	47960	47960	she	919	“ B - Bedroom , ”
47995	48006	48007	48007	Max	25	“ I ’m not going to make it that far . ”
48044	48055	48023	48023	he	25	“ Mine . Every damn inch of you is mine . ”
48398	48405	48406	48406	he	25	“ Never run from me again , ”
48414	48419	48406	48406	he	25	“ We belong together . ”
48438	48448	48434	48434	she	26	“ Do it . I know you want to . ”
48465	48469	48470	48470	Max	25	“ Do it . ”
48531	48536	48537	48537	he	25	“ I ca n’t , ”
48549	48573	48574	48574	she	26	“ I know the difference between abuse and love play . For God ’s sake , do it . And make me come , ”
48584	48591	48592	48592	Max	25	“ I ’m not exactly playing , ”
48689	48698	48686	48686	she	26	“ Please , Max . Make me come . ”
48711	48724	48725	48725	Max	25	“ Never leave me again , Mia . Not for any reason , ”
48740	48744	48751	48751	his	25	“ Promise me . ”
48760	48766	48767	48767	she	26	“ Touch me . Please , ”
48837	48841	48842	48842	he	25	“ Promise me , ”
48899	48909	48921	48921	His	25	“ Yes . I promise . I love you . ”
48910	48916	48917	48917	he	25	“ I love you too , ”
48977	48984	48985	48985	he	25	“ Come for me , sweetheart , ”
48988	49008	48985	48985	he	25	“ You ’re so hot , so wet . Let go . I ’ll catch you when you fall . ”
49163	49168	49169	49169	Max	25	“ What ’s this ? ”
49240	49243	49244	49244	she	26	“ You , ”
49248	49260	49244	49244	she	26	“ A red rose for true love , and your name . ”
49320	49324	49339	49339	He	25	“ Holy fuck ! ”
49415	49426	49427	49427	Max	25	“ You marked yourself for me , to be mine , ”
49430	49434	49435	49435	she	26	“ Had to , ”
49438	49444	49445	49445	She	26	“ Needed something . Anything . ”
49513	49539	49540	49540	He	25	“ That ’s the hottest thing I ’ve ever seen . My name branded on you forever . Does that make me a sick bastard ? ”
49554	49586	49587	49587	His	25	“ I want to stay just like this forever . My cock inside you , my body entwined with yours , surrounded by you . Nothing has ever felt this good . ”
49697	49703	49704	49704	he	25	“ I ca n’t wait , ”
49727	49734	49704	49704	he	25	“ I need to fuck you . ”
49831	49836	49837	49837	she	26	“ Then do it , ”
49842	49851	49837	49837	she	26	“ Please . I need it , too . ”
49947	49963	49964	49964	Max	25	“ I love you , Mia . I love you so goddamn much it hurts , ”
50087	50090	50091	50091	Max	25	“ Christ , ”
50345	50361	50362	50362	Mia	26	“ I guess we really should have talked before we did … um … that , ”
50374	50380	50381	50381	Max	25	“ We both have questions . ”
50385	50402	50403	50403	He	25	“ How we just communicated was incredible for me . I think talking is highly overrated . ”
50411	50423	50403	50403	He	25	“ I ca n’t believe you marked yourself with my name . ”
50435	50486	50487	50487	Max	25	“ I missed you so much that I had to do something or go crazy . I wanted something permanent to somehow keep you close to me . Maybe that sounds crazy , ’cause I never thought I ’d tattoo your name on my ass , but I wanted it . ”
50493	50556	50487	50487	Max	25	“ It looks good on you . I would have never asked you to do it because I know it hurts . But it ’s sexy as hell . I ’ll never look at it and not want to fuck you right that minute . So you better cover it up unless you want to be taken the second I see it . ”
50557	50574	50575	50575	she	939	“ Then I guess I ’m going to be walking away from you naked a lot , ”
50601	50607	50608	50608	he	25	“ Funny thing , though … ”
50622	50625	50626	50626	she	939	“ What ? ”
50652	50665	50642	50642	He	25	“ This . I got it a few months after you disappeared . ”
50833	50846	50847	50847	Max	25	“ But what if you had met someone else ? What if — ”
50865	50941	50847	50847	Max	25	“ There is no one else for me , sweetheart . Even Kade did n’t protest when I did it . I guess he got the fact that I needed to do it . He took me to someone he knew who had done a few tattoos for him in the past . He said he already wore a tribute to you every day , but I do n’t know where he put the tat . ”
50947	50954	50955	50955	she	26	“ It ’s not a tattoo , ”
50964	50975	50960	50960	Max	25	“ Then how does he wear a tribute to you ? ”
50976	50986	50987	50987	she	26	“ His shirts . He wears those awful shirts , ”
50991	51093	51094	51094	Max	25	“ When I was a kid , he used to always wear black . I told him it was depressing and he should wear something happy . He started picking up outrageous shirts , ones that I ’m sure he probably got teased about at school . But he wore them because I liked them , and I told him they were happy shirts . When we grew up , he never stopped . So he does wear something for me . And he never quit wearing them , even when he grew up and I started teasing him about them . ”
51097	51108	51094	51094	Max	25	“ I always thought he did that to irritate Travis . ”
51112	51175	51176	51176	She	26	“ That ’s only a side benefit and it might be the reason he does it now . But he started it because of me . I loved them when I was a kid . They were always happy shirts with the most outrageous characters or colors . Honestly , even though I joke around with him , I still love them . ”
51190	51215	51176	51176	She	26	“ Tell me why you used to run away . Was it really because of something I did ? The way I was acting ? ”
51216	51219	51220	51220	Max	25	“ No , ”
51231	51390	51220	51220	Max	25	“ From the time I understood what it meant to be adopted , I was grateful to my mother and father . I knew I ’d been thrown away by my real parents , and I was appreciative every day that I had parents who wanted me , who provided all of the things I needed and other things that I did n’t need . I was luckier than most of the kids at school , and it was n’t because I was born to them . They chose me . I guess I never wanted them to have a reason to regret it . So I became the perfect child . Or I tried to anyway . I did n’t want them to ever have a reason to regret adopting me . When I was really young , I think I was afraid they would give me back or reject me like my natural parents had done . ”
51426	51435	51436	51436	she	26	“ Did n’t you ever want to rebel ? ”
51454	51531	51451	51451	Max	25	“ Not really . Even after my parents died , I still wanted to please them . I graduated from college at the top of my class , did everything that was expected of me when I took over my father ’s business . I even thought of getting into politics because I knew it would make them proud . The only time I wanted to rebel from my normal behavior was when I met you . ”
51532	51540	51541	51541	she	945	“ So I was a bad influence ? ”
51548	51551	51552	51552	he	946	“ Never , ”
51573	51678	51552	51552	he	946	“ But it made me realize that I was n’t happy before I met you . I was living my life for two people I loved , but I was n’t them . I ’d tried to replicate their behavior because I thought being any other way would be a betrayal . I thought I needed to be like them because they were the parents who had wanted me . I was lifted out of a life of poverty because they adopted me . I wanted to be in the same class as my parents , even if I was n’t born into it . ”
51687	51702	51552	51552	he	946	“ Just because you ’re different does n’t mean you are n’t still good . ”
51735	51745	51718	51718	he	25	“ I do n’t think they even expected that . ”
51746	51768	51769	51769	Max	25	“ I do n’t think they did either . They would have loved me regardless , because they were good parents , ”
51779	51786	51769	51769	Max	25	“ I expected it of myself . ”
51787	51803	51718	51718	he	25	“ And when you met me ? I know you had relationships before we met . ”
51804	51920	51921	51921	Max	25	“ Not like you and me . Before we met , I did the expected things . I dated . I fucked . But I did n’t feel the same way . You made me crazy from day one . It knocked me on my ass . I lost my control with you . I ’d conditioned myself for years to be a calm , controlled , reasonable businessman like my father , but you blew that persona all to hell , and I was worried about losing you if I was n’t the man you wanted . I knew about your parents , and I knew you needed stability , someone rational and sane , ”
51925	51930	51921	51921	Max	25	“ Oh , Max , ”
51949	51969	51931	51931	Mia	26	“ I ’ve never met a saner man , and I kind of like the man you are now . ”
51992	51996	51980	51980	His	25	“ What changed ? ”
51997	52001	52002	52002	he	25	“ You died , ”
52009	52076	52005	52005	his	25	“ When I had to start admitting that I ’d probably never see you again , hold you again , talk to you again … I hated myself for never letting you know how much you meant to me , that you were my entire world . I fucking regretted every moment I had spent running away when I could have spent that time with you . ”
52085	52132	52133	52133	He	25	“ Now I hate myself for never seeing you , never noticing that you really needed me . I was a selfish prick . Had I stopped worrying about my image , I might have really known you — you might have told me about Danny . ”
52145	52191	52133	52133	He	25	“ Believe me , the last thing I wanted was for you to tie yourself in knots trying to please me . Hell , you please me just by breathing . You did n’t need to try to be anyone other than who you are . ”
52201	52257	52258	52258	God	43	“ I know that now . But those were my insecurities , baggage from my past . It was n’t you , Max . We ’re both responsible for not communicating . We were actually both hiding ; in love , but so afraid of losing that love instead of trusting ourselves and each other . ”
52296	52318	52286	52286	she	26	“ Growing up in my family was hell . My father ’s madness and abuse was hard on all of us . ”
52319	52328	52329	52329	Max	25	“ Your mother never thought about leaving him ? ”
52344	52392	52393	52393	Mia	26	“ No . Never . I think she ’d withstood his abuse for so long that she had closed down just to survive . We begged her to leave , even after we were grown , but she would n’t . She made excuses for his behavior , ”
52397	52425	52428	52428	his	25	“ I think she loved us , but she could n’t stand up to my father . I ’m sure she lived in her own private hell . ”
52442	52452	52428	52428	his	25	“ You ’re cold . You have goose bumps . ”
52478	52483	52484	52484	she	26	“ Then warm me , ”
52492	52500	52484	52484	she	26	“ We are sitting here completely naked . ”
52542	52545	52546	52546	he	25	“ Better ? ”
52561	52564	52553	52553	she	26	“ Yes . ”
52584	52602	52553	52553	she	26	“ Are you ready to tell me about the asshole who made you run away from me ? ”
52618	52637	52609	52609	Max	25	“ Travis told me the facts . What I want to know is how you felt about him . ”
52655	52772	52651	52651	she	26	“ He did n’t start out the way he turned out to be . He was charming , paid attention to me . The controlling behavior started later , a few months after we started dating . The sad part was , it really was n’t all that surprising . It was what I grew up with . He was a lot like my father . I was n’t very strong , Max . I fell into the cycle of abuse . He would apologize and promise never to do it again . But he did . I wanted out , but I guess I was n’t strong enough to fight my way free of him . ”
52773	52776	52777	52777	Max	25	“ Friends ? ”
52781	52815	52816	52816	she	952	“ No . Looking back , he managed to slowly , methodically isolate me . I had made friends at school , but he did n’t let me hang out with them anymore , ”
52820	52857	52816	52816	she	952	“ I was so relieved when he went to prison . I thought it was over . I left Virginia after school and came back to Florida , hoping to start over again , be smarter . ”
52858	52885	52886	52886	Max	25	“ Sweetheart , you ’re brilliant and creative . You were shaped by your past and you were just a kid . Do n’t blame yourself , ”
52899	52954	52886	52886	Max	25	“ He came back after he was released from prison , threatened me and your brothers , was ready to blow my brains out ? How did you keep him from picking me off ? From what I understand , he could have easily made the shot and was crazy enough to do it . ”
52955	52963	52964	52964	Mia	26	“ He was much worse than before , ”
52967	53008	52964	52964	Mia	26	“ He blamed me for everything and was completely delusional . He thought I really wanted to be with him , and he was willing to do anything to get what he wanted . I knew he ’d do it . ”
53017	53031	53044	53044	Max	25	“ I was unfaithful to you , Max . I ’m so sorry . ”
53216	53234	53235	53235	Max	25	“ The bastard raped you , did n’t he ? He should have gone back to jail . ”
53260	53271	53248	53248	his	25	“ Death is too good for a bastard like him . ”
53345	53411	53412	53412	she	26	“ He violated me . He did n’t rape me . He wanted me to suck him off ... and I did . You were almost on the plane . You just needed a few more minutes . I did n’t care , Max . I would have done anything he wanted right at the moment , as long as he did n’t hurt you , ”
53417	53436	53412	53412	she	26	“ Fuck ! I would rather the bastard had killed me than to force you to do that … ”
53456	53469	53443	53443	his	25	“ The night you recovered your memory , in the shower … ? ”
53470	53508	53509	53509	she	26	“ I still have nightmares about him . I was dreaming about it , and I woke up with my memory returning . I wanted to replace the bad memories with good ones . And I did , ”
53512	53527	53509	53509	she	26	“ Shit . That had to be hard . You did n’t have to — ”
53528	53551	53552	53552	she	26	“ I wanted to . I wanted to so very badly . And it was hard . But it was n’t difficult , ”
53574	53594	53552	53552	she	26	“ I ’ve always wanted to , but you never seemed to want that , so I stopped trying . ”
53595	53629	53630	53630	Max	25	“ Oh , baby … I wanted it . I wanted your sweet mouth on me so badly that I knew if it happened , I would n’t be able to stay controlled , ”
53635	53640	53641	53641	she	26	“ It was good , ”
53649	53657	53641	53641	she	26	“ It will keep the nightmares away . ”
53658	53692	53693	53693	he	25	“ I ’ll keep the nightmares away . You ’ll never have bad dreams again . I ’ll replace every moment of sorrow you ’ve had with happiness . I swear I will , ”
53781	53793	53778	53778	she	26	“ Just love me like this forever . It ’s enough . ”
53794	53800	53801	53801	he	25	“ I ’ll never stop , ”
53812	53847	53848	53848	he	25	“ Just promise me you wo n’t ever try to protect me again . Not at your own expense . I would have rather died than to let him lay a finger on you , ”
53911	53945	53946	53946	He	25	“ I ’m not sure I can make that promise . It would n’t have saved me , Max . Danny still would have hurt me that day . But it saved you . ”
53952	53955	53956	53956	he	25	“ Promise , ”
53959	53962	53956	53956	he	25	“ No , ”
53966	54000	53956	53956	he	25	“ I ca n’t . Could you make the same promise ? You said no more lies , and I wo n’t lie to you . I ’d protect you if I could . ”
54001	54004	54005	54005	he	25	“ Fine , ”
54008	54035	54005	54005	he	25	“ I ’ll just make damn sure you ’re never in a position where you have to make that decision again . And no more running . ”
54041	54046	54047	54047	she	26	“ No more running , ”
54050	54063	54064	54064	he	25	“ If you need to run , I ’m going with you , ”
54068	54090	54064	54064	he	25	“ If you had told me you needed to disappear , I would have arranged it … for both of us . ”
54091	54099	54152	54152	His	25	“ But your career , your business — ”
54100	54151	54158	54158	he	25	“ Do n’t mean a damn thing without you . Do you think I ’d give a flying fuck about money or anything else if you were in danger ? I ’d disappear with you , be presumed dead along with you to protect you and your brothers without hesitation . ”
54179	54205	54206	54206	she	958	“ I ’ve been through over two years of counseling , and it ’s still hard to believe someone can love me like you do , ”
54209	54225	54226	54226	she	958	“ I ’ve come a long way , but I ’ll have my insecure moments , ”
54230	54252	54226	54226	she	958	“ I ’ll still find it hard to absorb that it ’s finally over . That we ’re all safe now . ”
54322	54338	54339	54339	he	25	“ Take all the time you need , baby . I ’ll convince you eventually , ”
54380	54388	54376	54376	she	26	“ You ’re amazing , Max Hamilton . ”
54389	54401	54402	54402	he	25	“ Did you think so when I was smacking your ass ? ”
54409	54423	54424	54424	she	26	“ Yes . It made me want to be naughty all over again , ”
54428	54449	54450	54450	he	25	“ Sweetheart , I want you to let me know if I ever scare you , or push your boundaries , ”
54455	54468	54450	54450	he	25	“ My control when it comes to you is n’t exactly reliable . ”
54469	54499	54500	54500	Mia	26	“ I ’m not afraid of you , Max . And I never could be . I know you ’d never hurt me . You make me feel safe . ”
54591	54610	54611	54611	he	25	“ You ’re safe now , and I ’m going to make damn sure you stay that way , ”
54634	54640	54630	54630	she	26	“ Did Travis kill Danny ? ”
54649	54673	54646	54646	he	25	“ Probably . It was technically an accident , but Travis was there . Is the fact that he ’s dead bothering you ? ”
54674	54755	54630	54630	she	26	“ No . It does n’t bother me personally that Danny is dead . He deserved it , my family is safe , and it means he wo n’t be around to terrorize anyone else . But poor Travis already put Danny in jail . I hate that he might have had to kill someone for me to be free . He does have a conscience , but he ’s always done whatever it took to protect me and Kade . ”
54756	54769	54770	54770	Max	25	“ You know he was the one who put Danny in jail ? ”
54775	54823	54824	54824	she	963	“ Of course I knew . Does he really think I ’m that stupid ? He shows up in Virginia , sees what ’s happening , and Danny is suddenly going to prison ? I knew Travis had done it . What actually happened to kill Danny ? ”
54828	54943	54944	54944	Max	25	“ When Travis finally located Danny , he went to talk to him . Danny fled in a vehicle and Travis took off after him . Danny ended up going down a very high ravine in Colorado after he lost control during the chase . And believe me , I doubt that Travis felt a twinge of remorse after what the bastard had done to you . When he had verification that Danny was dead , he arranged to bring you home , but apparently never got a chance to talk to you about it because you were gone when he got home from his meeting . Why were you at the picnic anyway ? ”
54949	54958	54944	54944	Max	25	“ You had just gotten back to Florida . ”
54959	55018	55115	55115	Max	25	“ I knew you ’d probably be there . I saw the invitation at Travis ’ house . I knew you ’d probably hate me for what I ’d done , but I wanted to see you . I could n’t help myself . I kept moving closer , but I did n’t think you ’d recognize me . ”
55019	55030	55031	55031	Max	25	“ No chance of that . I could sense you , ”
55036	55057	55031	55031	Max	25	“ But the disguise was good enough that no one else did . Did you cut your hair that day ? ”
55058	55100	55101	55101	she	964	“ No . I had it done about a year ago . My long hair was used as a weapon too many times . I did it to feel better . It was kind of like therapy . It felt good , ”
55105	55114	55115	55115	Max	25	“ He pulled you around by your hair ? ”
55144	55147	55140	55140	She	26	“ Yes . ”
55164	55167	55168	55168	Max	25	“ Tired ? ”
55171	55204	55205	55205	she	964	“ Very . I did n’t sleep last night . I wanted to savor the feeling of being together one last time , even though you were three sheets to the wind , ”
55208	55232	55205	55205	she	964	“ I can only imagine the whopper of a hangover you must have had this morning . Do you even remember last night ? ”
55233	55237	55238	55238	Max	25	“ Not much , ”
55242	55268	55269	55269	she	964	“ Do you want me to fill you in how you accused me of being with another man and how you wanted to hate me ? ”
55275	55307	55269	55269	she	964	“ And why did you bring Tucker ? I ’m assuming my brothers left and took Tucker with them , but I thought you and my dog barely tolerated each other . ”
55333	55381	55382	55382	Max	25	“ I did think you had a boyfriend . I did n’t exactly get the whole story before I laid into your brother . All I heard was that he ’d been responsible for taking you away from me . We did n’t talk much after that . ”
55411	55457	55405	55405	his	25	“ And the only thing I have in common with that ugly canine is the fact that we both love you . I could n’t leave him at the house alone . I was being humane . He ’s still a pain in my ass . ”
55458	55471	55472	55472	Mia	26	“ Do you talk to him ? Tucker ’s a good listener , ”
55476	55488	55489	55489	Max	25	“ He ’s judgmental . I hate that in a dog , ”
55527	55532	55533	55533	Mia	26	“ You adore him , ”
55536	55552	55553	55553	Max	25	“ He irritates the hell out of me . Blames me because you went away , ”
55556	55568	55569	55569	she	26	“ You could have dropped him at the neighbor ’s house , ”
55573	55578	55569	55569	she	26	“ They love Tucker . ”
55579	55585	55586	55586	Max	25	“ He wanted to come , ”
55590	55599	55586	55586	Max	25	“ He was whining . He missed you . ”
55627	55635	55636	55636	She	26	“ Did you make peace with Travis ? ”
55653	55665	55666	55666	Max	25	“ Yeah . We ’ve agreed not to kill each other , ”
55672	55676	55666	55666	Max	25	“ And Kade ? ”
55677	55688	55689	55689	he	25	“ I still owe him for laughing at my hangover , ”
55696	55701	55693	55693	Mia	26	“ Was it bad ? ”
55702	55728	55729	55729	he	25	“ Bad enough to make me want to be a teetotaler . I ’m not sure I can ever drink another drop of alcohol again , ”
55733	55753	55754	55754	he	25	“ Now I know why I ’ve never gotten drunk . I had some sense before I met you , ”
55757	55785	55786	55786	Mia	26	“ The thought of you betraying me and happily living your life somewhere else made me crazy . I remember how I felt before I got drunk . ”
55789	55805	55786	55786	Mia	26	“ I ca n’t believe you ’ve never been drunk . Not even in college ? ”
55806	55817	55880	55880	Mia	26	“ Nope . I studied while everyone else was partying . ”
55818	55827	55828	55828	Mia	26	“ Oh God . You really are perfect , ”
55834	55855	55856	55856	she	26	“ And there could never be anyone else , Max . I even had your name tattooed on my ass , ”
55867	55879	55880	55880	Mia	26	“ Yeah . You did . And it ’s fucking beautiful . ”
55883	55899	55880	55880	Mia	26	“ I forgot that you curse now , so I guess you are n’t perfect . ”
55900	55925	55926	55926	he	25	“ I always cursed . I just never did it in front of you . My dad never swore in front of my mother , ”
55930	55938	55939	55939	Mia	26	“ Feel free to let it fly , ”
55945	55980	55939	55939	Mia	26	“ I have two brothers . I ’ve heard every profanity in existence and like to use a few occasionally . But since you never swore , I tried not to let one slip . ”
55981	56029	56030	56030	Max	25	“ Christ , we really were pathetic . I ’ve always adored you , but I ’m not sure we ever really knew each other . No , I take that back . My heart knew you , but the rest of me was a damn idiot , ”
56034	56069	56030	56030	Max	25	“ I ’m sorry I was n’t there for you when you needed me . You should n’t have needed to run to Travis . You should have been able to come to me . ”
56081	56126	56070	56070	Mia	26	“ I did n’t allow it . And I was n’t there for you either , Max . But I think we ’ve both changed . Can we just start over again ? I ’d like to be a real wife to you now . ”
56138	56159	56127	56127	Max	25	“ Did you really think there was ever any question about it ? You ’re not going anywhere , sweetheart . ”
56214	56224	56239	56239	he	25	“ You belong to me too , you know . ”
56225	56238	56239	56239	he	25	“ Baby , I ’ve known that from the moment we met , ”
56258	56262	56263	56263	she	26	“ Me too , ”
56546	56551	56545	56549	a “ work in progress	1689	“ work in progress , ”
57064	57085	57039	57039	She	81	“ I hope you do n’t mind . I used your music app . I left my phone in Florida . ”
57127	57139	57140	57140	he	25	“ You ’re my everything . What ’s mine is yours , ”
57151	57166	57167	57167	she	81	“ So you do n’t mind if I use your shaver on my legs ? ”
57171	57178	57179	57179	he	25	“ Okay , anything except that , ”
57192	57214	57184	57184	He	25	“ Oh hell , you can use that too . If the blade gets blunt , I ’ll get another one . ”
57243	57257	57240	57240	she	26	“ I would n’t dare . I know where men draw the line . ”
57258	57266	57267	57267	Max	25	“ There are no lines with us , ”
57271	57288	57267	57267	Max	25	“ Cross the line any time you want to with me . Invade my personal space . ”
57405	57413	57414	57414	Mia	26	“ I thought we were going riding , ”
57514	57526	57527	57527	Max	25	“ Maybe we need to take a different type of ride , ”
57542	57558	57559	57559	she	26	“ I ’m glad you said that , because I was thinking the same thing , ”
57608	57611	57622	57622	She	26	“ ride . ”
57637	57647	57648	57648	she	26	“ Happy birthday , Happy anniversary , merry Christmas , ”
57713	57719	57720	57720	Mia	26	“ Whose car is this ? ”
57732	57760	57720	57720	Mia	26	“ It ’s yours now . I wanted to get you something for all the holidays we ’ve missed together . And I know you want it . ”
57779	57789	57769	57769	he	25	“ How did you know I wanted a Ferrari ? ”
57851	57898	57839	57839	her	26	“ I was already arranging it before I had to leave the second time . I went to use your laptop a few times , and the screen was up for this car . Obviously you wanted it . Why did n’t you just buy it ? ”
57916	57940	57941	57941	He	25	“ Because it ’s not sensible . Why do I need another car , especially one that costs over a quarter million dollars ? ”
57962	57988	57989	57989	she	1007	“ Max … you can afford it . You can have things you want . You do n’t have to always do the sensible thing , ”
57994	58017	57989	57989	she	1007	“ Sometimes it ’s fun to do something just because you want to and not try to apply any reason to it . ”
58056	58070	58071	58071	he	25	“ You did this for me ? How did you get it here ? ”
58077	58097	58098	58098	she	1007	“ With my brother ’s help . Kade arranged to get it sent here . Do you like it ? ”
58102	58112	58098	58098	she	1007	“ I paid for it from my own funds . ”
58203	58219	58220	58220	He	25	“ Hell yeah . I love it . I ’ve been wanting a Ferrari forever . ”
58268	58283	58284	58284	Max	25	“ You ’ll rent a sports car , but you wo n’t own one ? ”
58300	58309	58284	58284	Max	25	“ I had to scratch the itch occasionally . ”
58324	58331	58321	58321	she	26	“ It ’s permanently cured now . ”
58354	58360	58361	58361	he	25	“ I have another itch , ”
58377	58403	58361	58361	he	25	“ I ca n’t believe you did this for me . How is it that you seem to know what I want before I do ? ”
58404	58407	58408	58408	she	1007	“ Observation , ”
58415	58459	58408	58408	she	1007	“ I spied this time . And you knew you wanted it ; you just would n’t admit it to yourself . You ’ve spent a lot of senseless money on me in the past , but you make different rules for yourself . ”
58489	58499	58476	58476	Mia	26	“ I actually got something for you , too . ”
58507	58517	58476	58476	Mia	26	“ And spending money on you is never senseless . ”
58518	58521	58522	58522	she	1007	“ What ? ”
58566	58573	58579	58579	he	25	“ I got it in Florida . ”
58594	58613	58589	58589	he	25	“ I did n’t know if we ’d find your wedding ring again . So I got this . ”
58647	58652	58653	58653	Mia	26	“ Oh , Max . ”
58666	58678	58653	58653	Mia	26	“ It ’s incredible . But I have my wedding ring . ”
58679	58685	58686	58686	Max	25	“ You have another finger , ”
58694	58709	58710	58710	He	25	“ One ring for our first marriage , and another for our second chance . ”
58732	58736	58737	58737	he	25	“ Keep me , ”
58770	58791	58759	58759	she	26	“ This is exquisite . It must have cost you a fortune . The sapphire is at least seventeen carats . ”
58823	58844	58813	58813	she	1016	“ Cost is n’t exactly a problem . I wanted more diamonds , but Gabrielle said it would be overkill . ”
58845	58880	58881	58881	Max	25	“ Gabrielle . Oh , God . I knew this looked like her work . But she ’s booked forever for custom stuff . How did you get her to do this so quickly ? ”
58957	58963	58964	58964	he	25	“ Do you like it ? ”
58993	59019	58989	58989	her	26	“ There is n’t a woman in the world who would n’t . Thank you , Max . I love it . I love you . ”
59020	59025	59026	59026	He	25	“ Do n’t cry . ”
59035	59044	59026	59026	He	25	“ It was supposed to make you smile . ”
59045	59076	58989	58989	her	26	“ I am happy . It ’s just such an incredible piece of jewelry . You did n’t need to do this . I already have a gorgeous wedding ring . ”
59077	59088	59089	59089	he	25	“ You did n’t have to buy me a Ferrari , ”
59093	59098	59099	59099	she	26	“ I wanted to , ”
59102	59105	59106	59106	he	25	“ Ditto , ”
59113	59123	59124	59124	she	26	“ Are you planning on giving me a ride ? ”
59246	59255	59256	59256	Max	25	“ Do we know where we ’re going ? ”
59280	59285	59286	59286	Mia	26	“ Does it matter ? ”
59451	59461	59442	59442	his	25	“ Nope . It does n’t matter at all . ”
59462	59477	59478	59478	Mia	26	“ You look like a teenage boy who just got his driver ’s license , ”
59483	59509	59510	59510	he	25	“ I ’ve had a license for a long time , woman . But I do feel like a teenager in a couple of ways , ”
59525	59528	59510	59510	he	25	“ How ? ”
59529	59576	59577	59577	he	25	“ I want to see if this vehicle really does go from zero to sixty in less than four seconds and you make me as horny as a teenage kid who wants nothing more than to get into the panties of the girl sitting beside him , ”
59585	59593	59594	59594	Mia	26	“ I ’m pretty easy for you , ”
59602	59608	59609	59609	She	26	“ I ’m your wife . ”
59616	59630	59609	59609	She	26	“ Turn right . It ’s a long stretch of pretty straight road . ”
59861	59870	59871	59871	Max	25	“ Zero to sixty in under four seconds , ”
59896	59915	59916	59916	Mia	26	“ Well , let ’s see it , Grandpa . Tear it up . Just watch for deer , ”
59978	59985	59986	59986	Max	25	“ Damn , it really does , ”
60118	60127	60128	60128	she	26	“ Turn up here . The next right , ”
60234	60250	60251	60251	Mia	26	“ This is one of my favorite spots . I want you to see it , ”
60367	60373	60374	60374	Mia	26	“ I love it here , ”
60378	60390	60374	60374	Mia	26	“ I used to come here when I was really lonely . ”
60402	60408	60409	60409	he	25	“ How often was that ? ”
60439	60443	60444	60444	she	26	“ Every day , ”
60463	60476	60444	60444	she	26	“ There was n’t a day that I did n’t miss you . ”
60624	60650	60616	60616	he	25	“ I love you . I missed you so much I did n’t feel like I was alive anymore . I need you , Mia . ”
60701	60707	60708	60708	she	26	“ Your kisses are dangerous , ”
60901	60904	60905	60905	Max	25	“ Mia ! ”
60985	60993	60996	60996	Max	25	“ Fuck . I ’m coming down , ”
61008	61017	61002	61002	she	26	“ No , Max . Go for help . ”
61073	61087	61058	61058	she	26	“ You ca n’t climb down . You ’ll go down . Please . ”
61111	61115	61116	61116	Max	25	“ Like hell , ”
61128	61137	61121	61121	his	25	“ You ca n’t hang on that long . ”
61175	61183	61235	61235	he	25	“ Max ! Damn it . Stop . ”
61210	61234	61235	61235	he	25	“ You ’re not fucking dying here , sweetheart . Not today . Not on any day . I just got you back , ”
61266	61276	61260	61260	she	26	“ This is crazy . We ’ll both die . ”
61277	61284	61285	61285	Max	25	“ Nobody . Is . Dying , ”
61373	61378	61346	61346	his	25	“ Max . Please . ”
61435	61441	61442	61442	she	26	“ Stubborn , pigheaded man , ”
61446	61456	61442	61442	she	26	“ You ’re supposed to be the cautious one . ”
61457	61465	61466	61466	Max	25	“ Not when it comes to you , ”
61470	61478	61466	61466	Max	25	“ You ’re going up , sweetheart . ”
61479	61486	61487	61487	He	25	“ Max . You ca n’t — ”
61509	61514	61515	61515	he	25	“ Climb , dammit , ”
61695	61705	61706	61706	Max	25	“ Get your ass back over that edge now , ”
61733	61740	61720	61720	Mia	26	“ You can grab my hand . ”
61741	61748	61749	61749	Max	25	“ Just . Move . Back . ”
61903	61908	61909	61909	he	25	“ Are you okay ? ”
61951	61970	61971	61971	she	26	“ I ’m fine . I was just afraid you ’d kill yourself . What were you thinking ? ”
61987	62026	61971	61971	she	26	“ That was a stupid , risky thing to do . Do n’t you ever do that again , Maxwell Hamilton . You took at least twenty years off my life and scared the shit out of me . ”
62131	62150	62177	62177	his	25	“ What would I do if something happened to you , Max ? I could n’t stand it . ”
62151	62173	62174	62174	Max	25	“ I know . That ’s how I felt for over two years when I thought you were dead , baby , ”
62256	62273	62248	62248	she	26	“ I could n’t have borne it . I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry . ”
62292	62372	62373	62373	Max	25	“ I do n’t care about the past anymore , Mia . I care about us now . If I have you now , nothing else matters . I get that you were trying to protect me . I get that you did n’t know what else to do . I contributed to the whole mess with my own fucked - up way of handling everything . Let it go . Right now I need to be inside you , ”
62389	62398	62373	62373	Max	25	“ We ’re alive , we ’re together . ”
62399	62412	62413	62413	she	26	“ I ca n’t believe you came down that cliff after me , ”
62420	62435	62436	62436	Max	25	“ It does n’t matter where you are — I’ll always come after you , ”
62542	62546	62547	62547	Max	25	“ Be still , ”
62696	62704	62705	62705	he	25	“ I need you to need me , ”
62749	62761	62705	62705	he	25	“ I already do . Fuck me , Max . Please . ”
62762	62778	62779	62779	he	25	“ Do you know how I felt when you went over that cliff , sweetheart ? ”
62801	62804	62805	62805	Mia	26	“ Yes , ”
62809	62822	62805	62805	Mia	26	“ The same way I felt when I saw you hanging there . ”
62823	62834	62835	62835	Max	25	“ I felt like you were dying all over again . ”
62849	62858	62835	62835	Max	25	“ And I died for a moment too . ”
62909	62914	62915	62915	she	26	“ I need you , ”
62930	62945	62946	62946	he	25	“ You ’re wet for me , sweetheart . But I want you needier , ”
62965	62993	62946	62946	he	25	“ I want you to come for me . Because I know that once I ’m inside you , I wo n’t last . Not this time . ”
63038	63054	63055	63055	she	26	“ Then make me come . Because I have to have you inside me now , ”
63169	63178	63179	63179	he	25	“ Put your arms and legs around me , ”
63200	63215	63190	63190	he	25	“ Nothing between us this time . You feel incredible . So damn good . ”
63299	63302	63303	63303	she	26	“ Yes , ”
63394	63399	63391	63391	she	26	“ I love you . ”
63561	63576	63551	63551	her	26	“ You scared the hell out of me . Do n’t do it again . ”
63595	63618	63619	63619	he	25	“ Sweetheart , if it sends you into that kind of passionate rage , I think I ’ll do it every day , ”
63626	63632	63633	63633	she	26	“ I ’ll divorce you , ”
63637	63643	63644	63644	he	25	“ No you wo n’t , ”
63656	63662	63663	63663	she	26	“ How do you know ? ”
63667	63673	63674	63674	he	25	“ Because you love me , ”
63679	63685	63674	63674	he	25	“ Yeah . I do . ”
63747	63770	63742	63742	his	25	“ Do you realize we ’re actually outside and naked ? This really is n’t good for your image , you know . ”
63771	63787	63788	63788	Max	25	“ You shot my famous Hamilton control all to hell the moment I met you , ”
63791	63799	63788	63788	Max	25	“ No more Mr. Perfect for me . ”
63800	63805	63806	63806	Mia	26	“ Do you care ? ”
63861	63882	63883	63883	He	25	“ Hell no . I ’m starting to learn that being a little bit wicked is a lot more fun . ”
64225	64237	64238	64238	Kade	29	“ Yeah . No problem . I can check it out , ”
64257	64285	64286	64286	Max	25	“ It ’s pretty unlikely , but I have to check , and I ’m not ready to leave Mia again so soon . I ca n’t , ”
64300	64311	64312	64312	Kade	29	“ And she has projects that she has to complete . ”
64324	64335	64312	64312	Kade	29	“ You two need to knock that crap off eventually . ”
