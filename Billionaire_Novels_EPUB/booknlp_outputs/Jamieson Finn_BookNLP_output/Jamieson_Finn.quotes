1211	1258	1155	1155	your	0	” She was beautiful , and my cock was starting to rise to the occasion . I ’d had a bit of a dry spell lately and had n’t had sex in about six weeks . Six weeks too long as far as I was concerned . “
1279	1283	1274	1274	you	0	” she asked . “
1287	1363	1274	1274	you	0	” I watched her walk across the bar and over to the hallway where the restrooms were located . Short black dress , black heels , hourglass figure , and long lean legs . My imagination ran wild with images of what was underneath that sexy dress . With any luck , I ’d find out soon enough . A few moments later she returned and took her seat next to me with a smile . “

1533	1646	1497	1497	you	0	” I threw some cash on the bar and we headed to my hotel . * * * * Grace Why the hell not ? He was incredibly sexy with his short brown hair , strong masculine jawline that sported the sexiest five o’clock shadow and eyes that were gray with a hint of blue swirled within . Not to mention his six - foot three muscular body . This was my last night in New York before I ventured off tomorrow to a new city and leave my old life behind . Might as well have one last New York fling . We walked around the block to the Mandarin Hotel . “
1649	1662	1497	1497	you	0	” I spoke as we walked through the lobby to the elevators . “
1670	1695	1665	1665	you	239	” He winked . The moment the elevator doors shut , Jamieson placed his hand on my cheek and brought his lips to mine . “

1811	1826	1712	1712	I	0	” he spoke as he placed his hands on each side of my face . “
1831	1928	1712	1712	I	0	” Our lips collided , and our tongues met for the first time . I was overly turned on by this man and my already soaked panties proved it . He reached around and unzipped my dress , letting it fall to the ground , exposing my bare breasts . My nipples hardened at his stare as his fingers lightly brushed against them . His hand wrapped around my back and held me in place while his other hand dipped down the front of my panties , navigating its way to my wet and sensitive area . “
1939	1949	1950	1950	You	244	” he whispered as his tongue stroked my neck . “
1966	1967	1968	1968	I	0	” “
1980	2086	1968	1968	I	0	” He dipped his finger inside me and I gasped . The pleasure this man gave was intoxicating and erased the pain I ’d felt over the past month . My nails dug into the cotton of his shirt as he explored me , hitting my G - spot and sending me over the edge to a full blown orgasm . Arching my back with the tight grip he had around me , I threw my head back and felt like I ’d died and gone to Heaven . Shit . I ’d never felt anything like it before . What the hell just happened ? “
2093	2170	1968	1968	I	0	” He smiled . My heart was pounding out of my chest as he lightly pushed me back on the bed . Taking a step back , he quickly unbuttoned his shirt and threw it to the floor . I felt the vibrations down below as I stared at his muscular arms , chest and beautifully sculpted six pack . I waited in anticipation as he took down his pants that revealed his black boxer briefs . “
2174	2298	1968	1968	I	0	” I spoke . He walked towards me as I sat on the edge of the bed . Hooking my fingers around the waistband of his briefs , I slowly took them down , releasing his large hard cock . I gulped at the madness in front of me . Thank you , I silently whispered . Wrapping my fingers around his shaft , I moved it up and down . Moans of pleasure erupted from him as he tangled his fingers in my hair . I took him inside my mouth and sucked him as if he was a lollipop . His grip on my hair tightened as he pushed my head down so I could take almost all of him in . “
2301	2305	1968	1968	I	0	” he moaned . “
2309	2320	1968	1968	I	0	” He lifted my head and removed himself from me . “
2329	2735	2321	2321	I	0	” He panted as he pushed me on my back . He bent down and his tongue made its way up my inner thigh and he removed my panties with ease . The wetness poured from me as excitement raged throughout my body . Not only did this man have magical hands , but he had a magical tongue that sent my body into another orgasm . He stood up , grabbed his pants from the floor and took a condom out of his wallet . Tearing the package open with his mouth , he rolled the condom over his hard cock . This was it . He was going in and I was more than ready . Hovering over me , his lips met mine and he thrust inside me , quickly but with ease . * * * * Jamieson The heat inside her was overwhelming as my cock was buried between her fiery walls . The pleasure , the power , and the freedom I felt was indescribable . There was something different about her than the other women I ’d fucked , and I could n’t explain it . This total stranger . This beautiful stranger held me captive in her hold as I thrust in and out of her . Her sexual moans graced the room and turned me on even more which I thought was impossible . Her body was perfect , just like I imagined back at the bar . I gave a few more thrusts and then pulled out and flipped her on her stomach . Entering her from behind , I sat up and grabbed hold of her tight ass while my cock took its pleasure . Between both of our moans , I was sure the people next to me could hear , but I did n’t care . This was the best sex I ’d had in a very long time and I did n’t want it to end . I pulled out and flipped her on her back , taking her perfect C cup natural breasts in my mouth while I thrust in and out of her again with long smooth strokes . I sat her up and wrapped my arms around her as her legs wrapped tightly around my waist . We both moved simultaneously , slow and with ease . She wanted to make this last as much as I did . “
2740	2750	2321	2321	I	0	” I whispered as I pulled out of her . “
2753	2785	2786	2786	Jamieson	51	” I gave her a smile as I grabbed her hand , helped her from the bed and led her over to the large window that overlooked the brightly lit city . “
2788	2789	2786	2786	Jamieson	51	” “
2801	2953	2794	2794	Nobody	245	” I pushed her up against the glass as I held her hands with mine against it . My body pressed into hers as my cock found its way inside her . I stared at the reflection of us through the window while I fucked her . My fingers interlaced with hers as I felt her tighten around me and the rush of warmth coated me . I moved in and out of her like an animal as the pressure increased and my cock exploded , leaving me breathless with an out of control heart rate . I dropped my head to her shoulder as I tried to regain my breath . She unhooked one of our hands and brought it around to the back of my neck , softly stroking it with her delicate fingers . I pulled out and went straight to the bathroom to dispose of the condom . “
2961	2971	2955	2955	you	247	” she asked as she put on her panties . “
2979	3002	3003	3003	You	250	” I smirked . She picked up her dress and slipped it on , asking me to zip it up for her . “
3010	3014	3003	3003	You	250	” I spoke . “
3058	3059	3055	3056	a stranger	252	” “
3064	3084	3060	3060	I	0	” I spoke with disappointment as I hoped we could have sex again one more time before I left . “

3160	3171	3158	3158	you	250	” I chuckled as she opened the door and walked out .

5514	5533	5506	5506	he	51	“ If you ’re talking about the bullet against the renal artery , yes , I see it . ”
5534	5553	5456	5456	he	51	“ That ’s really risky to remove . You could do some serious damage to this poor woman . ”

5950	5969	5947	5947	she	70	“ I walked down to the ER and Jackie told me you were already in the operating room . ”
5970	5988	5989	5989	I	0	“ She ’s going to be fine . It ’s good to see you again , Renata . ”
5995	6025	5989	5989	I	0	“ Welcome to Cedars - Sinai , Grace . What a way to start your first day . I heard you operated with our Chief Neurosurgeon , Dr. Finn . ”
6026	6030	5947	5947	she	70	“ I did . ”
6031	6034	6035	6035	she	317	“ And ? ”
6038	6042	6035	6035	she	317	“ And what ? ”
6043	6062	5947	5947	she	70	“ No swooning , tripping over your feet when he ’s around , heart palpitations , mild sweating ? ”
6063	6068	6069	6069	I	0	“ He seems nice . ”
6072	6129	6069	6069	I	0	“ He ’s arrogant , cocky , and a womanizer , but he ’s the best neurosurgeon in the country and a great asset to this hospital . Do n’t let him get to you and do n’t take anything personally . As long as you remember those two things , you ’ll do just fine . ”
6130	6139	6140	6140	I	0	“ I can handle men like Dr. Finn . ”
6143	6169	6140	6140	I	0	“ I know you can , and I was beyond thrilled when I got your call . I never thought you ’d leave New York . ”
6170	6178	6069	6069	I	0	“ It was time for a change . ”
6179	6189	6069	6069	I	0	“ I thought you were happy at the hospital ? ”
6190	6202	6203	6203	I	0	“ I was . It ’s more of a personal change , ”
6206	6216	6203	6203	I	0	“ Well , I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
6220	6233	6217	6217	She	318	“ You are another great asset to this hospital , my dear . ”
6360	6375	6376	6376	I	0	“ Oh , excuse me . I did n’t know you were with someone , ”
6384	6388	6379	6379	I	0	“ Dr. Finn . ”
6392	6400	6389	6389	Renata	70	“ You ’ve met Dr. Grace Harper ? ”
6401	6413	6452	6452	her	70	“ Yes . We just saved a woman ’s life together . ”
6414	6436	6437	6437	I	0	“ I heard . Good job . Come in and sit down . I ’m just finishing up with Dr. Harper . ”
6474	6492	6471	6471	her	70	“ I saw the way you looked at her , Jamieson . Leave her alone . Understand ? ”
6493	6496	6497	6497	I	0	“ What ? ”
6503	6510	6497	6497	I	0	“ I have n’t done anything . ”
6511	6533	6471	6471	her	70	“ Not yet you have n’t . It ’s already going to be hard on her as it is being here . ”
6534	6539	6540	6540	I	0	“ Why is that ? ”
6545	6553	6554	6554	She	70	“ That ’s none of your business . ”
6559	6599	6554	6554	She	70	“ Now , the reason I needed to speak with you is because Mary called this morning and said she quit . She could n’t even bother giving two weeks ’ notice . Do you know anything about that ? ”
6614	6622	6604	6604	I	0	“ No . I have no idea . ”
6623	6631	6632	6632	she	70	“ I ’m sure you do n’t , ”
6639	6659	6632	6632	she	70	“ Are we done here , Renata ? I have a consult with a patient I ’m late for . ”
6660	6668	6669	6669	She	70	“ We ’re done , Dr. Finn . ”
6674	6705	6671	6671	her	70	“ Remember what I said about Dr. Harper . And another thing , if I lose any more staff , best neurosurgeon or not , I ’m coming after you . ”
6712	6727	6728	6728	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about it . I ’ll be on my best behavior . ”
6731	6747	6728	6728	I	0	“ I wo n’t worry because I ’ll be keeping a close eye on you . ”
6849	6860	6861	6861	I	0	“ Hello , Mr. Bind . I ’m Dr. Finn . ”
6866	6881	6861	6861	I	0	“ Nice to meet you Dr. Finn . This is my wife , Athena . ”
6882	6888	6889	6889	I	0	“ Nice to meet you . ”
6910	6929	6892	6892	I	0	“ It says here you ’ve been having some trouble walking and you ’ve been experiencing back pain . ”
6930	6973	6994	6994	his	326	“ Yes . I ’ve been to two doctors already and they ca n’t seem to find out what the problem is other than a strained muscle in my back . But nothing is helping , and the pain is getting worse . ”
6974	6983	6984	6984	I	0	“ Any other symptoms you ’ve been experiencing ? ”
6987	6993	6994	6995	his wife	218	“ Tell him , Jeff , ”
6998	7001	7006	7006	her	63	“ Athena . ”
7015	7022	7008	7008	I	0	“ What ’s been going on ? ”
7023	7034	7035	7035	he	326	“ I ’ve been losing control of my bladder lately , ”
7040	7050	7035	7035	he	326	“ Okay . Anything else I need to know ? ”
7051	7071	7074	7074	Athena	74	“ He ’s been complaining that his right leg keeps going numb and the other day he fell twice , ”
7077	7144	7074	7074	Athena	74	“ I see . Well , I can promise you that I will get to the bottom of all these symptoms you ’re having . I ’m going to schedule you for an MRI , and I want it done today . If you ’ll wait here a moment , I ’ll go speak with the scheduling nurse and see when we can fit you in . ”
7145	7152	7153	7154	Jeff Bind	73	“ Thank you , Dr. Finn , ”
7157	7162	7153	7154	Jeff Bind	73	“ You ’re welcome . ”
7187	7203	7204	7204	she	75	“ Dr. Finn , let me guess . You need an MRI scheduled for today , ”
7217	7227	7228	7228	I	0	“ How do you always know that , Yvonne ? ”
7231	7244	7228	7228	I	0	“ Because it ’s the only time you ever walk down here . ”
7245	7259	7293	7293	she	75	“ I have a patient who needs one stat . What ’s open ? ”
7260	7269	7228	7228	I	0	“ We ’re completely booked , Dr. Finn . ”
7270	7273	7274	7274	I	0	“ Yvonne . ”
7277	7282	7274	7274	I	0	“ Work with me . ”
7283	7287	7288	7288	She	75	“ Three o’clock . ”
7309	7328	7329	7329	I	0	“ Perfect . The name is Jeffery Bind . I ’ll go tell him . Thanks , Yvonne . ”
7345	7383	7384	7384	I	0	“ Your MRI is scheduled for three o’clock , so I would suggest going to the cafeteria and grabbing some lunch and we ’ll see you back here at two thirty . Are you claustrophobic at all ? ”
7387	7394	7384	7384	I	0	“ No . I ’m not . ”
7395	7407	7408	7408	I	0	“ Good . I ’ll see you in the MRI room . ”
7419	7431	7432	7432	I	0	“ Excuse me , I ’m needed down in the ER , ”
7441	7446	7435	7435	I	0	“ Someone paged me ? ”
7456	7467	7449	7449	Jackie	112	“ Dr. Harper did . She ’s in room five . ”
7468	7473	7474	7474	I	0	“ You paged me ? ”
7495	7508	7509	7509	She	334	“ Yes . I need to speak with you for a moment . ”
7515	7527	7528	7528	I	0	“ What ’s going on that you needed me down here ? ”
7531	7585	7528	7528	I	0	“ Two - year - old male named Charlie . His parents brought him for flu symptoms . They took him to their family doctor last week and he ’s not getting any better . He sleeps all day , vomiting on and off , and he ’s been complaining his head hurts . ”
7586	7594	7595	7595	I	0	“ Sounds like the flu to me , ”
7598	7634	7595	7595	I	0	“ That ’s what I thought too until I was talking to him and noticed his asymmetric eye movements and his parents said that when he goes to get up , he falls every time . ”
7635	7644	7645	7645	I	0	“ You think it ’s a brain tumor ? ”
7648	7653	7654	7654	she	338	“ AT / RT , ”
7657	7672	7654	7654	she	338	“ Come on , Grace . I would say that ’s jumping the gun . ”
7673	7694	7695	7695	I	0	“ I hope I ’m wrong , but I do n’t think I am . I ’ve seen it before . ”
7711	7729	7730	7730	I	0	“ Fine . I ’ll schedule an MRI . Sedate him first and then bring him upstairs , ”
7733	7743	7730	7730	I	0	“ And I pray to God you ’re wrong . ”
7744	7748	7749	7749	she	338	“ Me too , ”
7935	7943	7946	7946	Jamieson	51	“ I see you found the rooftop , ”
7964	7971	7959	7959	he	51	“ Jackie told me about it . ”
7972	7990	7991	7991	he	51	“ Best place of the entire hospital . Especially at night when the city is lit up , ”
8006	8015	7994	7994	he	51	“ I think we should talk , Grace . ”
8016	8020	8021	8021	I	0	“ About what ? ”
8027	8035	8021	8021	I	0	“ That night in New York City . ”
8036	8041	7994	7994	he	51	“ What about it ? ”
8042	8068	7994	7994	he	51	“ The fact that we had sex and now we ’re working together . I just do n’t want you to get the wrong idea . ”
8069	8091	8021	8021	I	0	“ Ah , you do n’t want me to think that because we had sex there could be something between us . ”
8092	8097	8098	8098	He	51	“ Something like that . ”
8106	8119	8098	8098	He	51	“ Is that usually what happens when you sleep with a woman ? ”
8120	8123	8021	8021	I	0	“ Unfortunately . ”
8130	8213	8127	8127	his	51	“ I ’m not like the other women you ’ve slept with . So no worries , Dr. Finn . Trust me when I say there is absolutely nothing between us . I did n’t think about it then , I do n’t think it now , and I never will . It was one night of two consenting adults and it meant absolutely nothing . A relationship or even the thought of one is not a part of my new life . ”
8214	8228	8229	8229	he	51	“ Good . Mine either . I ’m happy we cleared that up , ”
8250	8257	8258	8258	I	0	“ Charlie ’s MRI is done , ”
8261	8269	8258	8258	I	0	“ Let ’s go take a look . ”
8303	8306	8307	8307	Jamieson	51	“ Shit , ”
8310	8321	8322	8322	He	51	“ There ’s a tumor in the posterior fossa region . ”
8325	8330	8322	8322	He	51	“ You were right . ”
8348	8359	8360	8360	he	51	“ It ’s times like these I hate my job , ”
8363	8383	8360	8360	he	51	“ By the way , how did you get stuck with this patient ? I thought you were trauma ? ”
8384	8400	8401	8401	I	0	“ The ER is short staffed , and I ’m needed all over the place , ”
8404	8423	8401	8401	I	0	“ Welcome to Cedars - Sinai , Dr. Harper . Shall we go tell Charlie ’s parents together ? ”
8424	8427	8428	8428	I	0	“ Sure . ”
8481	8507	8508	8508	I	0	“ Mr. and Mrs. Canfield , we have the results back of Charlie ’s MRI , and I ’m afraid it ’s not good news , ”
8511	8531	8532	8532	I	0	“ Charlie has a brain tumor known as AT / RT in the posterior fossa region of his brain , ”
8535	8541	8542	8542	Jamieson	51	“ Near his stem cell , ”
8546	8551	8542	8542	Jamieson	51	“ Oh my God . ”
8564	8575	8558	8558	her	78	“ Are you saying that our son has brain cancer ? ”
8582	8590	8591	8591	Jamieson	51	“ Yes . I ’m afraid so , ”
8594	8632	8591	8591	Jamieson	51	“ It is imperative that we operate immediately to remove as much of the tumor as possible . After the surgery , we ’ll send in a pediatric oncologist to discuss chemotherapy and or radiation for Charlie . ”
8652	8658	8659	8659	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
8670	8677	8659	8659	I	0	“ Are you a pediatric neurosurgeon ? ”
8683	8731	8678	8679	Mr. Canfield	79	“ No , I ’m not . But I ’m the best neurosurgeon in the country , I ’ve operated on many children , and I can assure you that Charlie is in good hands with me . I ’ll need your permission to perform the surgery . ”
8732	8736	8737	8738	Mr. Canfield	79	“ Of course . ”
8752	8764	8765	8765	Jamieson	51	“ Get him prepped and I ’ll send the anesthesiologist down , ”
8794	8800	8801	8801	I	0	“ How did it go ? ”
8804	8846	8801	8801	I	0	“ He ’s stable . I was able to remove eighty - five percent of the tumor . The rest is in the pediatric oncologist ’s hands now . Jackie , can I have a moment with Dr. Harper , please ? ”
8847	8850	8851	8851	She	361	“ Sure . ”
8865	8873	8874	8874	he	51	“ What are doing after your shift ? ”
8877	8883	8874	8874	he	51	“ Going home . Why ? ”
8884	8918	8930	8930	him	51	“ I was thinking maybe we could grab some dinner together . I am the only person you know in Los Angeles , so I thought that a proper welcome was in order . ”
8919	8924	8925	8925	I	0	“ Is that so ? ”
8932	8945	8925	8925	I	0	“ To be honest , I do n’t know you at all . ”
8946	8966	8967	8967	He	51	“ We had sex , Grace . I think we know each other , at least a little bit . ”
8970	8978	8967	8967	He	51	“ I ’m not a total stranger . ”
8979	8986	8987	8987	I	0	“ I get off at eight . ”
8990	9001	8987	8987	I	0	“ Great . I ’ll pick you up down here . ”
9002	9005	9006	9006	I	0	“ Okay . ”
9132	9135	9136	9136	I	0	“ What ? ”
9139	9149	9136	9136	I	0	“ What ’s up with you and Dr. Finn ? ”
9150	9164	9124	9124	her	370	“ Nothing . We ’re just grabbing a bite to eat after work . ”
9165	9211	9124	9124	her	370	“ I like you , Grace . I ’ve only known you a few short hours , but I can tell we ’re going to be good friends , and as a friend , I feel it ’s my duty to warn you about him . ”
9212	9224	9136	9136	I	0	“ Trust me , Jackie , you do n’t have to . ”
9225	9291	9292	9292	I	0	“ Oh , but I do . He is the finest - looking specimen to ever walk the face of this earth and he knows it . He uses it to his advantage with women . He ’s nothing but a heartbreaker , commitment - phobe , and a manwhore . I just do n’t want to see you get caught up in his games . ”
9344	9373	9374	9374	I	0	“ Trust me . I wo n’t get caught up in anything . I know guys like Dr. Finn and I ’m well aware of their massive insecurities . ”
9377	9413	9374	9374	I	0	“ Besides , relationships of any kind are off the table for me . I came here to Los Angeles to start a new life and Dr. Jamieson Finn does not fit into that plan . ”
9414	9420	9421	9421	She	371	“ You go , girl . ”
9430	9446	9424	9424	she	371	“ You just may be the only woman in existence to say no to him . ”
9606	9610	9611	9611	I	0	“ Mr. Bind , ”
9620	9650	9611	9611	I	0	“ I apologize for the delay and I thank you for your patience , but I had to operate on a two - year - old from the ER . ”
9651	9664	9665	9665	I	0	“ Gee , Dr. Finn . I hope the kid is okay . ”
9687	9702	9672	9672	I	0	“ Your MRI shows that you have an ependymoma tumor located on your spine . ”
9703	9709	9710	9710	he	376	“ I have spinal cancer ? ”
9719	9759	9710	9710	he	376	“ I ’m going to need to do a needle biopsy and remove a small piece of the tissue and send it to our pathology lab to confirm , but in most of these cases , they are benign . ”
9760	9776	9777	9777	he	376	“ So is that why I ’ve been having back pain and the other symptoms ? ”
9780	9783	9777	9777	he	376	“ Yes . ”
9784	9792	9710	9710	he	376	“ Even the loss of bladder control ? ”
9793	9796	9797	9797	I	0	“ Yes . ”
9801	9808	9797	9797	I	0	“ Thank God . Now what ? ”
9809	9894	9710	9710	he	376	“ I ’ll need to go in and remove it . The good news is that where it ’s located on the spine , I ’m positive I will be able to remove the entire tumor . Once I do , you ’ll recover and be good to go and live your life . If , for some unknown reason , I ca n’t remove the entire tumor , then you ’ll most likely have to undergo radiation to destroy the rest of it . ”
9895	9907	9908	9908	he	376	“ What are my chances you can remove the entire thing ? ”
9911	9920	9921	9921	I	0	“ I ’d say ninety - eight percent . ”
9930	9937	9924	9924	He	376	“ Thank you , Dr. Finn . ”
9938	9987	9710	9710	he	376	“ Do n’t thank me yet . I would like to admit you , run some bloodwork , and do the needle biopsy and get it sent down to the lab . Come tomorrow , I ’ll go in and remove the tumor . Sound like a plan ? ”
9988	10005	9924	9924	He	376	“ Yeah . Sure . I ’ll do anything at this point to alleviate this pain . ”
10006	10047	10048	10048	I	0	“ Good . I ’ll send my nurse in and she ’ll take care of everything . Once your bloodwork comes back , we ’ll set you up for the biopsy . So I ’ll see you in a while . ”
10075	10081	10082	10082	She	82	“ Yes , Dr. Finn ? ”
10088	10134	10082	10082	She	82	“ Let ’s get a basic metabolic panel , CBC with Diff , and a type and screen on Mr. Jeffery Bind , stat . I ’ll need you to get him admitted and prepped for a needle biopsy of a tumor on his spine . ”
10141	10155	10135	10135	I	0	“ I have dinner plans at eight , so let ’s get moving . ”
10156	10163	10184	10184	she	70	“ Of course , Dr. Finn . ”
10164	10180	10184	10184	she	70	“ And who may I ask do you have dinner plans with at eight o’clock ? ”
10190	10197	10198	10198	I	0	“ Are you spying on me ? ”
10201	10221	10198	10198	I	0	“ No . I ’m up here to talk to a patient and I could n’t help but overhear . ”
10222	10236	10184	10184	she	70	“ To answer your question , I have dinner plans with a colleague . ”
10237	10246	10247	10247	Her	70	“ That colleague better not be Dr. Harper . ”
10268	10273	10274	10274	I	0	“ Labs , now ! ”
10350	10356	10357	10357	She	63	“ You ’re on time . ”
10360	10377	10357	10357	She	63	“ And it ’s a good thing because I ’m starving . Where are we going ? ”
10384	10420	10378	10378	I	0	“ There ’s this great restaurant not too far from here called Rosie ’s . The owner is a friend of mine , and I was able to get us a reservation for eight thirty . ”
10421	10429	10430	10430	She	63	“ Sounds good . Let ’s go . ”
10458	10462	10463	10463	Grace	63	“ Nice car . ”
10466	10473	10463	10463	Grace	63	“ Very California doctor - ish . ”
10474	10496	10522	10522	I	0	“ Thanks . I like it . Are you looking at cars ? I have a friend who owns a dealership . ”
10497	10511	10463	10463	Grace	63	“ Already bought one . Picked it up yesterday right when I landed . ”
10512	10518	10519	10519	I	0	“ You ’re very organized . ”

10591	10635	10636	10636	She	63	“ I always wanted one , but living in New York , I did n’t need a car because I rarely drove . I walked , took a taxi , or rode the subway . I ’m cool . What can I say ? ”

10982	11002	11068	11070	A handsome man	397	“ Interesting . That ’s a very well - respected hospital . Who did you do your fellowship under ? ”
11003	11008	11073	11073	he	397	“ Dr. Ryan Knowles . ”
11009	11036	11073	11073	he	397	“ I know him . He ’s an excellent surgeon . Come to think of it , did n’t Renata used to work at Manhattan Memorial ? ”

11943	11949	11950	11950	he	51	“ What are you doing ? ”

11960	11973	11934	11934	His	51	“ The hell you are . Dinner was my idea , remember ? ”
11974	12015	12016	12016	His	51	“ Yes . And to quote you , ‘ I was thinking that maybe we could grab some dinner together . ’ You did n’t say ‘ I want to take you to dinner . ’ There ’s a difference . ”
12031	12066	12020	12020	he	51	“ I specifically said that a proper welcome to Los Angeles was in order . That ’s what I ’m doing . I ’m welcoming you to Los Angeles by treating you to dinner . ”
12067	12074	12075	12075	I	0	“ This is n’t a date , ”
12078	12105	12075	12075	I	0	“ No , it ’s not a date . It ’s me , a new friend and co - worker , welcoming you to Los Angeles . ”

12216	12220	12210	12210	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
12229	12256	12224	12224	his	51	“ Because . This is my new life and that does n’t include sex with people I work with . I have rules , Dr. Finn . ”
12257	12278	12224	12224	his	51	“ So you ’re saying you had sex with your co - workers at Manhattan Memorial in your old life ? ”
12279	12319	12224	12224	his	51	“ No . I ’ve never had sex with anyone at Manhattan Memorial . Like I said , I have rules . What happened between us in New York was a one - time thing during my old life . ”
12323	12365	12366	12366	I	0	“ You ’re really confusing me with this whole ‘ old life - new life ’ business . What happened to you that you up and left New York to start a new life ? Was it because of some guy ? ”
12372	12408	12366	12366	I	0	“ Remember at dinner when you told me that you did n’t want to talk about your mother ? Well , I do n’t want to talk about my old life back in New York . ”
12409	12423	12322	12322	Jamieson	51	“ Then answer me this . Have you ever lived in California before ? ”
12424	12438	12439	12439	I	0	“ I did . Up until I was ten years old . Why ? ”
12447	12456	12439	12439	I	0	“ It ’s just a comment Renata made . ”
12457	12463	12322	12322	Jamieson	51	“ What did she say ? ”
12464	12493	12322	12322	Jamieson	51	“ She was warning me to stay away from you and she just mentioned that it was going to be hard on you as it is being here . ”
12494	12505	12506	12506	she	406	“ My parents were killed here in a car accident , ”
12509	12518	12506	12506	she	406	“ Gee , I ’m sorry , Grace . ”
12519	12535	12536	12536	She	406	“ Like I told you and my Aunt Cora , that was twenty years ago . ”

12567	12591	12592	12592	she	406	“ She was the one who took me in and raised me . Why was Renata warning you to stay away from me ? ”
12599	12616	12592	12592	she	406	“ You know Renata . Playing Mama Bear and being protective of the resident she raised . ”
12632	12650	12624	12624	she	406	“ I do n’t need protection and I ’m exhausted . Thank you for dinner , Jamieson . ”
12651	12658	12659	12659	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , Grace . ”
12666	12672	12659	12659	I	0	“ Have a good night . ”

12812	12833	12809	12809	I	0	“ I got a new job and I moved away from New York . Please do n’t contact me again . ”
12841	12874	12836	12836	he	93	“ You moved out of the state ? WTF , Grace ? I gave you what you asked . I did n’t bother you at all . Please , talk to me . ”
12875	12932	12933	12933	I	0	“ I will never talk to you again . Go get some help , Sam . If you have a shred of decency left in you , you ’ll do what ’s right . Like I said , do n’t contact me again . You are my past mistake and that ’s where you ’re staying . ”
13062	13072	13057	13057	me	0	“ It ’s Dr. Harper . You paged me ? ”

13182	13196	13129	13129	she	417	“ I did , Dr. Harper . Thank you for calling so promptly . ”
13197	13203	13204	13204	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
13207	13222	13204	13204	I	0	“ Nothing . I just forgot to ask you for your phone number earlier . ”
13223	13238	13239	13239	I	0	“ You told the hospital to page me so you could get my number ? ”
13246	13260	13239	13239	I	0	“ Yes . Like I said , I forgot to get it earlier . ”
13261	13275	13204	13204	I	0	“ You just could n’t have asked me for it in the morning ? ”
13276	13297	13239	13239	I	0	“ I could have , but why wait when I could get it now ? Good night , Dr. Harper . ”
13298	13305	13306	13306	I	0	“ Good night , Dr. Finn . ”
13470	13482	13466	13468	Dr. Ryan Knowles	87	“ Dr. Finn , to what do I owe the pleasure ? ”

13492	13499	13466	13468	Dr. Ryan Knowles	87	“ I ’m good , Jamieson . ”
13500	13513	13466	13468	Dr. Ryan Knowles	87	“ Listen , I understand you had Grace Harper under your fellowship . ”
13514	13542	13466	13468	Dr. Ryan Knowles	87	“ I did . Brilliant woman and surgeon . It broke my heart when she left . She ’s over there with you guys now , right ? ”
13543	13566	13466	13468	Dr. Ryan Knowles	87	“ Yes . I performed surgery with her yesterday and she ’s very good . She told me she studied under you . ”

13624	13644	13466	13468	Dr. Ryan Knowles	87	“ Just curious . I did n’t know if something happened over there to make her want to leave . ”
13645	13660	13661	13661	I	0	“ Nothing that I ’m aware of . Just Renata taking back her baby . ”

14485	14493	14481	14481	he	51	“ Because my wife cheated on me . ”
14494	14515	14516	14516	Jamieson	51	“ Well , if you really wanted to kill yourself , you ’d have to jump from a higher point , ”
14528	14541	14519	14519	I	0	“ The internet said three stories was enough if I fell right . ”
14542	14554	14555	14555	Jamieson	51	“ Do you always believe what you read on the internet ? ”
14559	14563	14564	14564	He	51	“ Dr. Harper . ”
14570	14609	14564	14564	He	51	“ I have surgery . Get the CT scan and let me know what it shows . It looks like it could be a basilar skull fracture from the look of his eyes . Also , call psych . ”
14610	14621	14633	14633	he	439	“ Sorry , I was tied up with a patient , ”
14642	14666	14633	14633	he	439	“ Dr. Harper . This is Dr. Logan Gray . Logan , meet Dr. Grace Harper , the hospital ’s new trauma surgeon . ”
14667	14674	14675	14675	He	439	“ The pleasure is all mine . ”
14678	14684	14685	14685	he	439	“ What do we have ? ”
14695	14719	14685	14685	he	439	“ This is Mr. Stone and he fell from a three - story window . It looks like he has multiple leg fractures . ”
14720	14727	14728	14728	he	439	“ I told you I jumped , ”
14731	14742	14728	14728	he	439	“ Your legs do n’t look good , Mr. Stone , ”
14747	14764	14743	14744	Dr. Gray	95	“ It looks like you ’re going to need surgery so I can reset the bones . ”
14765	14775	14776	14776	Jackie	112	“ Dr. Harper , his blood pressure is 80/60 , ”
14779	14787	14776	14776	Jackie	112	“ Increase his saline to 500cc ’s . ”
14799	14815	14788	14788	I	0	“ He has some internal bleeding . Let ’s get him up to the OR . ”
14839	14851	14852	14852	I	0	“ I ’m here . Did you get that CT scan ? ”
14856	14865	14866	14866	she	63	“ Up on the monitor , Dr. Finn , ”
14869	14884	14866	14866	she	63	“ Just as I thought . Okay , let ’s open up his skull . ”
14900	14919	14920	14920	I	0	“ I ’ve got a bleeder and his brain is starting to swell . Get the paddles now , ”
14923	14927	14928	14928	Grace	63	“ Damn it , ”
14942	14949	14931	14931	she	63	“ Charge to 200 . Clear ! ”
14958	14986	14987	14987	Grace	63	“ Charge to 200 again . Clear ! Come on , Mr. Stone . I know how you feel , but it ’s not worth dying over , ”
15012	15019	15020	15020	I	0	“ Welcome back , Mr. Stone , ”
15031	15038	15023	15023	I	0	“ Nice work , Dr. Harper . ”
15039	15049	15050	15050	she	63	“ Can you try to keep my patient alive ? ”
15053	15065	15050	15050	she	63	“ Doing my best . How about a drink after work ? ”
15066	15074	15079	15079	he	95	“ I ’d love to , Jamieson , ”
15087	15102	15079	15079	he	95	“ I was n’t asking you , Logan . I was asking Dr. Harper . ”
15103	15130	15131	15131	he	95	“ I ’m your best friend . We always get drinks together . Wait a minute . Is something going on between the two of you ? ”
15134	15158	15131	15131	he	95	“ Nothing is going on between us , Dr. Gray . As for a drink , Dr. Finn , the answer is no . ”
15159	15162	15079	15079	he	95	“ Why ? ”
15163	15183	15184	15184	she	443	“ Because you and drinks will get me into trouble . Dr. Reed , can you close for me ? ”
15187	15194	15184	15184	she	443	“ Of course , Dr. Harper . ”
15195	15208	15079	15079	he	95	“ I ’m done as well . Close up , Dr. Kerrigan . ”
15209	15215	15216	15216	I	0	“ Yes , Dr. Finn . ”
15228	15237	15238	15238	I	0	“ What did you mean by that comment ? ”
15241	15254	15255	15255	She	443	“ Remember what happened the last time we had just drinks together ? ”
15258	15267	15255	15255	She	443	“ Of course . How could I forget ? ”
15268	15282	15290	15290	her	443	“ I already told you that I ’m not sleeping with you again . ”
15295	15310	15288	15288	I	0	“ Come on , Grace . You have to admit it was damn good . ”
15320	15356	15288	15288	I	0	“ Yes , Jamieson , it was good . But that does n’t change the fact that we work together , and no matter how good it was , I ’m not breaking my rule . ”
15357	15368	15290	15290	her	443	“ We had dinner together last night and nothing happened . ”
15369	15390	15391	15391	Her	443	“ Exactly , and you ’ll do anything you can to get in my pants again . Am I right ? ”
15406	15533	15397	15397	I	0	“ Yeah . I will . I ’m not a liar and I wo n’t ever lie to you . I liked the night we had together back in New York . What ’s wrong with wanting to have another night like that again ? You are n’t interested in a relationship , I ’m not interested in one , so why ca n’t the two of us just have casual sex to unwind from the stress of our work and call it a day ? I can have sex with any woman in this hospital with the snap of my fingers and without having to beg . But here I stand , wanting it with you . You should be flattered , by the way . ”
15553	15556	15550	15550	her	448	“ What ? ”
15603	15611	15615	15615	she	70	“ What did you say to her ? ”
15624	15629	15615	15615	she	70	“ I said nothing . ”
15630	15649	15650	15650	Her	448	“ Then why did she have a disgusted look on her face and shake her head at you ? ”
15654	15661	15662	15662	I	0	“ Because I turned her down . ”
15665	15676	15662	15662	I	0	“ I ’m staying away from her like you asked . ”
15677	15687	15688	15688	She	448	“ You ’re so full of shit , Jamieson . ”
15803	15813	15814	15814	he	95	“ What ’s going on between you and Grace ? ”
15817	15823	15814	15814	he	95	“ Nothing is going on . ”
15824	15848	15849	15849	He	95	“ So then you wo n’t mind if I ask her out ? It ’s obvious she does n’t want to date you . ”
15852	15867	15849	15849	He	95	“ You go anywhere near her and I will kill you , my friend . ”
15868	15879	15880	15880	he	95	“ Ah ha . I knew it . What gives ? ”
15898	15914	15888	15888	I	0	“ She was the woman I had sex with my last night in New York . ”
15915	15928	15849	15849	He	95	“ The one you described as the best night of your life ? ”
15929	15932	15933	15933	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
15939	15946	15933	15933	I	0	“ Wait , I ’m confused . ”
15947	15982	15849	15849	He	95	“ I did n’t know she was moving to Los Angeles and she did n’t know I was a neurosurgeon here . In fact , I did n’t even know she was a doctor . ”
15983	16003	15849	15849	He	95	“ So that ’s what she meant when she said that you and drinks would get her in trouble . ”
16004	16020	15933	15933	I	0	“ Yep . She has this stupid rule . No sleeping with co - workers . ”
16021	16034	16035	16035	Logan	95	“ That ’s dumb . Everyone sleeps with their co - workers , ”
16038	16071	16035	16035	Logan	95	“ Apparently not Dr. Grace Harper . Do you know she has a photographic memory , graduated at the top of her class at Columbia , and has an I.Q. of 142 ? ”
16072	16089	16090	16090	He	95	“ That ’s why she wo n’t have sex with you again . She ’s smart . ”
16093	16108	16090	16090	He	95	“ I took her to dinner last night as a welcome to L.A. gesture . ”
16109	16114	16115	16115	he	95	“ No sex after ? ”
16118	16128	16115	16115	he	95	“ Nope . Her rule got in the way . ”
16129	16178	16179	16179	he	95	“ Well , my friend , looks like Dr. Grace Harper is one woman you ca n’t have with the snap of your fingers . Forget about her and move on . There are plenty of hot chicks in this hospital to have sex with . In fact , ”
16186	16206	16207	16207	He	95	“ I ’m going to go see if Caroline wants to meet me in the on - call room . ”
16210	16219	16207	16207	He	95	“ I ’ll catch you later , buddy . ”
16220	16231	16245	16245	he	95	“ Remember what I said ! Stay away from Grace . ”
16232	16241	16242	16242	he	95	“ I got your message loud and clear , ”
16412	16584	16588	16588	his	459	“ Grace , it ’s Sam . I ’m assuming you blocked my other number since none of my text messages will go through . I know you told me not to contact you , but I had to . We need to talk now . I ’m sorry for everything . But the one thing I ’m not sorry for is loving you . I still love you and I always will . Please call me . I know we can work this out . I ’m not giving up on us . You ’re too important to me . Please tell me which hospital you ’re working at now . If you do n’t want to , I ’ll meet you anywhere you want . Regardless of which state it is . Things are changing . I promise . I know my promises do n’t mean anything to you after what I ’d done , but I need you to trust me on this . Please , call me . ”
16691	16705	16706	16706	I	0	“ Just wondering if you might have changed your mind about that drink ? ”
16843	16868	16829	16829	He	51	“ Yeah . I did change my mind . Come to my apartment and we can have that drink . I ’m in apartment 3C. ”
16869	16876	16877	16877	I	0	“ I ’m on my way . ”
16980	16983	16984	16984	He	51	“ Hi . ”
16993	17002	16984	16984	He	51	“ I ’m happy you changed your mind . ”
17025	17028	17029	17029	He	51	“ Whoa . ”
17037	17045	17046	17046	I	0	“ Just shut up and fuck me , ”
17055	17062	17049	17049	I	0	“ Grace , are you sure ? ”
17063	17073	17074	17074	His	51	“ Keep talking and I might change my mind . ”
17111	17117	17118	17118	he	51	“ Where ’s the bedroom ? ”
17121	17132	17118	17118	he	51	“ Down the hallway . Second door on the right . ”
17216	17222	17223	17223	He	51	“ You are truly beautiful . ”
17350	17361	17362	17362	he	51	“ My God , you ’ve got me so hard , ”
17669	17682	17683	17683	he	51	“ You ’re going to come again . I can feel it , ”
17866	17875	17876	17876	he	51	“ I can stay if you ’d like , ”
17879	17895	17876	17876	he	51	“ Sure . It ’s late and we both have to be at work early . ”
17908	17923	17924	17924	He	51	“ I think this was a hell of a lot better than a drink . ”
17927	17936	17924	17924	He	51	“ What happened to you , Dr. Harper ? ”
17937	17998	17999	17999	He	51	“ I was horny , and since you ’re the only guy I really know in Los Angeles , I used you . Plain and simple . I ’m not going to sugar coat it . I needed sex and I knew you would give it to me since you ’d been practically begging for it since I got here . ”
18005	18026	17999	17999	He	51	“ Okay , then . I do n’t mind being used by you . But what happened to your rule ? ”
18027	18056	17924	17924	He	51	“ I guess I broke it . Just because we had sex , it does n’t mean things need to be awkward with us at work , right ? ”
18057	18073	17924	17924	He	51	“ Of course not . There will be no awkwardness on my end at all . ”
18074	18132	17999	17999	He	51	“ Good , because there wo n’t be any on my end either . I ’m going to sleep . It ’s been a long , hard day saving lives and I have new residents joining me tomorrow , so I need to be sharp and ready for them . Plus , I ’m on call tonight . ”
18133	18139	18140	18140	He	51	“ New residents , eh ? ”
18143	18155	18140	18140	He	51	“ Good luck with them . Good night , Dr. Harper . ”
18156	18182	17999	17999	He	51	“ Good night , Dr. Finn . By the way , no one is to know about this . No one at all . Understand ? ”
18183	18193	18194	18194	I	0	“ I totally understand . My lips are sealed . ”
18242	18247	18248	18248	My	0	“ Time of death . ”
18274	18281	18282	18282	Jamieson	51	“ Is that mine or yours ? ”
18289	18292	18282	18282	Jamieson	51	“ Mine . ”
18304	18317	18318	18318	I	0	“ I have to go . There ’s a trauma coming in , ”
18327	18335	18336	18336	he	51	“ Do you need me to help ? ”
18339	18362	18336	18336	he	51	“ No . Go back to sleep . I ’ll leave my key on the counter . Lock up when you leave . ”
18363	18367	18368	18368	He	51	“ Will do . ”
18399	18405	18406	18406	I	0	“ What do we have ? ”
18422	18447	18406	18406	I	0	“ Twenty - five - year - old male with three gunshot wounds to the abdomen . BP is holding in the low eighties . ”
18448	18464	18492	18495	one of the residents	475	“ Hi there . I ’m Dr. Harper . Can you tell me your name ? ”
18465	18468	18469	18469	he	51	“ Chris , ”
18474	18488	18489	18490	Dr. Cortez	100	“ Dr. Harper , there ’s a lot of blood in his urine , ”
18499	18532	18489	18490	Dr. Cortez	100	“ One of the bullets must have hit his kidney . Call the OR and let them know we ’re on our way up . Dr. Cortez , you can scrub in . ”
18533	18539	18541	18541	I	0	“ Thanks , Dr. Harper . ”
18617	18631	18634	18635	the nurses	378	“ Dr. Harper , the patient ’s girlfriend is in the waiting room , ”
18638	18658	18632	18635	one of the nurses	481	“ Thank you . I ’ll go talk to her . Can you close for me , Dr. Cortez ? ”
18659	18666	18667	18667	I	0	“ Of course , Dr. Harper . ”
18691	18696	18697	18697	I	0	“ For Chris Major ? ”
18700	18705	18706	18712	a frightened young woman in her twenties	484	“ How is he ? ”
18715	18761	18706	18712	a frightened young woman in her twenties	484	“ He ’s stable . He had three gunshot wounds to the abdomen . One of the bullets traveled and lodged in his lung and another one nicked his kidney . We had no choice but to remove his right lung and his left kidney . ”
18762	18767	18768	18768	she	484	“ Oh my God ! ”
18779	18800	18771	18771	she	484	“ I know it sounds scary , but Chris can live a full life with only one lung and kidney . ”
18801	18807	18706	18712	a frightened young woman in her twenties	484	“ Can I see him ? ”
18808	18835	18836	18836	I	0	“ In a few minutes , you can . I ’ll send Dr. Cortez out to get you as soon as Chris is in his room . ”
18858	18867	18852	18854	a police officer	486	“ Excuse me , are you Dr. Harper ? ”

19567	19605	19606	19606	I	0	“ Not really . That was all I could see . It was on the lock screen . You can change that setting to where it only shows the number or the name . Who is he ? ”
19615	19628	19606	19606	I	0	“ Just an ex - boyfriend who wo n’t get the hint . ”
19629	19642	19609	19609	I	0	“ I see . Is he the reason you left New York ? ”
19643	19648	19649	19649	she	63	“ Listen , Jamieson , ”
19659	19674	19649	19649	she	63	“ I ’m not talking about this . Okay ? I need coffee bad . ”
19687	19695	19696	19696	I	0	“ How was your trauma last night ? ”
19707	19724	19696	19696	I	0	“ Three gunshot wounds to the abdomen . I had to remove a lung and kidney . ”

19914	19922	19911	19911	I	0	“ Up all night with Dr. Finn ? ”
19927	19958	19923	19923	Her	63	“ Do n’t try to deny it , Grace . He stopped by here earlier looking for you . He said he needed to give you your phone and key . ”
19969	19978	19959	19959	I	0	“ Fine . He came over last night . ”
19979	19987	19988	19988	She	63	“ I ca n’t believe you caved . ”
19993	20007	20008	20008	I	0	“ It was n’t the first time . Please do n’t tell anyone , ”
20011	20028	20008	20008	I	0	“ I wo n’t , but what do you mean it was n’t the first time ? ”
20029	20047	19959	19959	I	0	“ We met in New York and had sex the night before I left to come here . ”
20048	20052	20053	20053	she	63	“ What ? ! ”
20056	20099	20053	20053	she	63	“ Shh ... We met in a bar and we were never supposed to see each other again . I did n’t know he was a neurosurgeon and I certainly did n’t know he worked at this hospital . Imagine the shock . ”
20100	20105	19959	19959	I	0	“ Damn , Grace . ”
20106	20136	19959	19959	I	0	“ Tell me about it . I vowed it was n’t going to happen again , but I had a weak moment . After all , look at him . ”
20137	20163	20053	20053	she	63	“ Trust me , I have . I get it . But you broke your rule . You let Dr. Jamieson Finn break your rule . ”
20164	20168	19959	19959	I	0	“ I know . ”
20177	20186	20169	20169	I	0	“ It ’s not going to happen again . ”
20187	20193	20053	20053	she	63	“ Sure it wo n’t . ”
20199	20216	20217	20217	She	506	“ By the way , your new residents are waiting for you in the conference room . ”
20224	20227	20217	20217	She	506	“ Thanks . ”
20256	20288	20289	20289	I	0	“ Good morning , I ’m Dr. Harper . Welcome to Cedars - Sinai . It ’s nice to meet you , Dr. Meadows , Dr. Sanders , and Dr. Adler . ”
20292	20334	20335	20335	I	0	“ You ’re with me for your trauma rotation . Trauma can be tricky , so you need to be on your game at all times . We ’re here to save lives people . So let ’s go save some . ”
20348	20364	20335	20335	I	0	“ Dr. Harper , we have a trauma coming ten minutes out . Surfing accident . ”
20365	20373	20374	20374	I	0	“ Okay . Let ’s get ready , ”
20405	20411	20412	20412	I	0	“ What do we have ? ”
20415	20444	20445	20446	the paramedic	516	“ Twenty - four - year - old male , abdominal trauma , possible head injury . BP 90/50 . Pulse is 126 . You ready for this ? ”
20449	20454	20445	20446	the paramedic	516	“ Oh my God , ”
20464	20478	20479	20479	I	0	“ I need some help out here . I have a resident down ! ”
20482	20489	20490	20490	I	0	“ Jackie , where am I ? ”
20499	20503	20504	20504	she	104	“ Trauma three , ”
20507	20554	20504	20504	she	104	“ Anyone else going to faint on me ? Because if you are , I suggest you leave now ! Call the OR and tell them we ’re on our way ! I need as much O negative as you can get from the blood bank , ”
20566	20575	20558	20558	Sara	54	“ His BP is dropping , Dr. Harper . ”
20576	20596	20597	20597	He	519	“ He ’s lost a lot of blood . Push one of epi and get me the crash cart . ”
20600	20607	20610	20610	him	519	“ Charge to 200 . Clear . ”
20617	20624	20608	20608	I	0	“ Dr. Adler , start compressions . “
20631	20637	20638	20638	We	520	” I shocked him again . “
20643	20648	20638	20638	We	520	” Dr. Adler spoke . “
20663	20694	20655	20656	Dr. Adler	105	” We ran down the hallway and to the elevator . Everyone was staring in shock as they saw part of his surfboard and intestines sticking out of his abdomen . “
20706	20711	20695	20696	Dr. Harper	63	” Dr. Adler spoke . “
20728	20741	20742	20742	You	105	” Dr. Adler and I were scrubbing in when Jamieson walked in . “
20746	20750	20742	20742	You	105	” he asked . “
20754	20769	20751	20752	Surfing accident	523	” Jamieson looked through the glass at the patient and then over at me . “
20779	20783	20786	20786	He	519	” he asked . “
20809	20810	20802	20802	They	524	” “
20820	20824	20813	20813	I	0	” He smiled . “
20834	20853	20813	20813	I	0	” I rolled my eyes as I looked over at Dr. Adler and she was staring at Jamieson . “
20856	20865	20813	20813	I	0	” He grinned as he started scrubbing in . “
20870	20871	20872	20873	Dr. Adler	105	” “
20875	20885	20886	20886	She	525	” She smiled like a school girl in love . “
20892	20896	20886	20886	She	525	” I spoke . “
20906	20941	20903	20904	Dr. Adler	105	” I walked into the operating room , where the scrub nurse put on my surgical gown and gloves . Walking over to the patient , I looked at the scans that were taken . “
20972	20973	20974	20974	I	0	” “
20981	20985	20974	20974	I	0	” Jamieson spoke . “

21023	21039	21020	21021	Dr. Finn	51	” I shot him a look as I could see the smirk beneath his mask . “
21089	21102	21020	21021	Dr. Finn	51	” We slowly pulled the board out and blood shot out everywhere . “
21120	21156	21158	21158	his	530	” Five hours in the OR , and my surfboard patient was stabilized . Jamieson stopped the bleeding in his brain and I fixed his abdomen and put his intestines back in their proper place . “
21162	21170	21158	21158	his	530	” I asked one of the nurses . “
21183	21210	21176	21176	They	531	” * * * * I sat in the on - call room with my knees to my chest as I read Sam ’s text message . “
21306	21403	21304	21304	you	533	” I deleted the message and blocked the number . Things were quiet in the ER , so I grabbed a cup of coffee and saw that Jamieson was doing a craniotomy in OR three . I walked over and sat in the gallery to watch him . Why ? I had no idea . He was a very skilled surgeon and I knew why they said he was the best in the country . Plus , I could n’t stop thinking about last night . But I was pissed that he said something to Jackie . “
21409	21423	21404	21404	He	535	” one of the nurses sitting next to me spoke to another nurse . “
21435	21444	21428	21428	he	535	” the nurse sitting next to her spoke . “
21451	21452	21453	21453	I	0	” “

21576	21593	21596	21598	a real asshole	538	” I sat there , taking in deep calming breaths as I listened to their conversation . “
21600	21613	21596	21598	a real asshole	538	” I spoke . Both of the nurses looked over at me . “
21631	21640	21643	21644	Dr. Finn	51	” the nurse with the black hair spoke . “
21648	21649	21643	21644	Dr. Finn	51	” “

21688	21692	21677	21677	you	539	” I smiled . “
21707	21708	21702	21703	Dr. Finn	51	” “
21773	21800	21768	21768	He	535	” I rolled my eyes as I took a sip of coffee . Getting up from my seat , I walked out and headed to the ER .
21847	21853	21854	21854	She	70	“ Good afternoon , Jamieson . ”
21857	21868	21854	21854	She	70	“ Hello , Renata . How can I help you ? ”
21869	21884	21820	21820	she	63	“ I ’m sending you to Las Vegas to speak at a medical conference . ”
21885	21892	21893	21893	I	0	“ Awesome . I love Vegas . ”
21896	21902	21893	21893	I	0	“ When am I leaving ? ”
21903	21916	21820	21820	she	63	“ Next Thursday . Your speaking time is Friday morning at nine a.m. ”
21917	21937	21938	21938	She	70	“ Excellent . I ’m off that weekend , so I can have some fun while I ’m there . ”
21945	21963	21938	21938	She	70	“ As much as I hate to do this , I ’m sending Dr. Harper with you . ”
21964	21967	21968	21968	I	0	“ Why ? ”
21973	22043	21968	21968	I	0	“ Because she is speaking right after you at ten a.m. The head of the medical conference called me because he heard Grace was our new trauma attending and he wants her there to speak about new trauma procedures that are to be put in place in all of the ER departments across the country . She ’s familiar with it because Manhattan Memorial already has theirs in place . ”
22044	22051	21938	21938	She	70	“ Have you told her yet ? ”
22052	22069	22070	22070	She	544	“ No . I ’m heading down there now . I ’m putting you on warning . ”
22075	22099	22070	22070	She	544	“ You are to stay away from her . No flirting , being charming , nothing . Do you understand me , Jamieson ? ”
22100	22138	22139	22139	I	0	“ And what am I supposed to do if she wants to take me back to her hotel room and rip my clothes off ? Reject her ? Do you know how that would make her feel ? ”
22142	22186	22139	22139	I	0	“ I swear to God , Dr. Finn . You ’ve caused enough drama around here with your manwhore ways and I will not allow you to get to Grace . She ’s important to this hospital and I will not lose her . ”
22187	22241	22242	22242	I	0	“ Do you honestly think if something happened between us that she would just up and quit her job ? She ’s a smart woman , Renata , and frankly , I ’m surprised you ’re giving her such little credit . After all , she was your resident . You raised her . ”
22245	22277	22242	22242	I	0	“ She is smart , but I ’ve seen even the smartest women succumb to the likes of guys like you and your charm . I care about her , Jamieson . ”
22278	22285	22286	22286	I	0	“ Did you just insult me ? ”
22291	22347	22286	22286	I	0	“ Listen , I ca n’t help it if women fall all over me . But the one thing I can help is making sure they know exactly what I do n’t want . These women know what they ’ll get and what they wo n’t get when they consent to having sex with me . ”
22348	22358	22359	22359	She	545	“ Oh my God , I ’ve heard enough . ”
22373	22385	22386	22386	I	0	“ You love me , Renata , and you know it ! ”
22462	22470	22471	22471	Logan	95	“ Hey , you got a minute ? ”
22480	22485	22471	22471	Logan	95	“ What ’s up ? ”
22486	22494	22474	22474	he	95	“ I think I ’m in trouble . ”
22495	22501	22502	22502	I	0	“ What did you do ? ”
22507	22517	22502	22502	I	0	“ Riley told me today that she ’s pregnant . ”
22523	22532	22518	22518	He	95	“ As in Riley the ICU charge nurse ? ”
22533	22541	22474	22474	he	95	“ Yeah . That ’s the one . ”
22542	22554	22555	22555	I	0	“ Wow . How the hell did you let that happen ? ”
22562	22599	22555	22555	I	0	“ It was one night . The one time I did n’t use a condom because the only one I had left broke . She said it did n’t matter because she was on birth control . ”
22600	22612	22474	22474	he	95	“ Either she lied to you or her birth control failed . ”
22613	22658	22474	22474	he	95	“ She said she ’s keeping it . Fuck , Jamieson . I do n’t know what to do . I do n’t want to be tied down to a kid . I like Riley but not enough to be her kid ’s father . ”
22659	22686	22555	22555	I	0	“ The truth is , you are the kid ’s father . If she ’s keeping it , you need to step up and take responsibility . ”
22687	22701	22702	22702	I	0	“ You would n’t be saying that if you were in my position . ”
22708	22721	22702	22702	I	0	“ I ’m not stupid enough to fuck someone without a condom . ”
22722	22732	22733	22733	He	550	“ Thanks for your support . I appreciate it . ”
22756	22785	22736	22736	I	0	“ I do support you , my friend . All kidding aside , Riley is having your baby . Did she say she wanted anything else from you ? ”
22786	22807	22736	22736	I	0	“ No . She said all she wants is for me to be a part of the kid ’s life . ”
22808	22832	22833	22833	He	550	“ Then you ’re semi off the hook . You can still fuck whoever you want and be a part - time dad . ”
22856	22891	22892	22892	I	0	“ I have to go . I have a consult . Try not to stress over it and take it one day at a time . And you better be at my house tonight . ”
22907	22911	22912	22912	I	0	“ You paged ? ”
22915	22922	22923	22923	She	63	“ Take a look at this . ”
22934	22948	22923	22923	She	63	“ Damn . That ’s a beautiful tumor right on the temporal lobe . ”
22949	22994	22923	22923	She	63	“ The patient is a thirty - two - year - old female who had a psychotic episode and went after her husband with a knife when she accused him of cheating on her . She actually succeeded and stabbed him in the arm . ”
22995	23007	22923	22923	She	63	“ How did you know to order a CT on her ? ”
23008	23060	22923	22923	She	63	“ When the paramedics brought her in , her speech was slightly slurred , and she had no memory of stabbing her husband when it had just happened thirty minutes prior to the paramedics getting there . I was going to page you , but I knew you were in surgery . ”
23061	23096	22923	22923	She	63	“ Good call . I ’ll schedule her surgery for tomorrow morning . Get her into a room and page me and I ’ll talk to her and her husband . Is he okay ? ”
23097	23103	23104	23104	She	554	“ He ’ll be fine . ”
23107	23117	23104	23104	She	554	“ Hey , did Renata talk to you yet ? ”
23118	23131	22923	22923	She	63	“ No . I ’ve been really busy with patients . Why ? ”
23132	23149	22923	22923	She	63	“ Just wondering . She told me she was on her way down to see you . ”
23150	23159	23160	23160	I	0	“ I ’m sure she ’ll find me . ”
23176	23208	23169	23169	I	0	“ I ’m having a few people over for drinks around eight . You can come if you want . It ’ll give you a chance to meet some more people . ”
23209	23225	23169	23169	I	0	“ Thanks . Maybe I will for a little bit . I ’m off tomorrow . ”
23226	23236	23237	23237	I	0	“ Great . I ’ll text you my address . ”
23269	23276	23280	23280	she	70	“ Grace , there you are , ”
23286	23291	23280	23280	she	70	“ Hey , Renata . ”
23292	23321	23280	23280	she	70	“ Listen , Robert Conway called , and he wants you to speak at the medical conference in Las Vegas on the new trauma procedures for the ER . ”
23322	23342	23280	23280	she	70	“ Robert Conway ? Gosh , I have n’t seen him in a long time . When is it ? ”
23343	23382	23383	23383	I	0	“ You ’ll leave next Thursday , and you ’ll be speaking Friday morning at ten . Now , I know what next Friday is and I think it would do you some good to not be here . ”
23397	23409	23383	23383	I	0	“ Another thing , you ’ll be going with Dr. Finn . ”
23410	23416	23417	23417	I	0	“ He ’s speaking too ? ”
23420	23423	23417	23417	I	0	“ Yes . ”
23435	23458	23424	23424	She	557	“ I know you ’re a smart girl and I do n’t have to reiterate what we already talked about regarding him . ”
23459	23466	23467	23467	I	0	“ No , you do n’t . ”
23475	23490	23467	23467	I	0	“ Listen , Renata , you do n’t have to try and protect me . ”
23491	23508	23509	23509	She	557	“ I know I do n’t , but I just ca n’t seem to help it . ”
23512	23531	23509	23509	She	557	“ What is it about Dr. Finn that has you so worried ? Do you not like him ? ”
23532	23660	23467	23467	I	0	“ On the contrary . I love Jamieson . He ’s highly intelligent and he ’s an excellent surgeon . He ’s the youngest doctor we ’ve ever had here to head up a department . He earned it . But , on the personal side , he ’s very closed off . He does n’t let anyone in or near him . He sleeps around too much and gets women ’s hopes up and then crushes them to the point where they quit . I just do n’t want to see that happen to you . You ’re new here and he ’ll see you as a challenge and charm his way into your life . He ’ll use you and then things will get messy . ”
23661	23670	23509	23509	She	557	“ I ’m a big girl , Renata . ”
23671	23690	23467	23467	I	0	“ I know , Grace . I just felt like I needed to have this talk with you . ”
23691	23707	23467	23467	I	0	“ Thank you . I appreciate it , but you have nothing to worry about . ”
23752	23758	23759	23759	I	0	“ Damn , Dr. Finn , ”
23802	23808	23809	23809	He	95	“ Grace , come in . ”
23814	23825	23811	23811	his	95	“ We ’re out on the beach having a bonfire . ”
23826	23831	23832	23832	I	0	“ Thanks , Logan . ”
23835	23845	23811	23811	his	95	“ Can I get you a beer or something ? ”
23846	23854	23811	23811	his	95	“ Sure . A beer sounds great . ”
23855	23861	23862	23862	He	95	“ Jamieson is out there . ”
23922	23930	23931	23931	He	95	“ Look who I brought with me . ”
23934	23939	23931	23931	He	95	“ Hello , Grace . ”
23943	23950	23940	23940	Jamieson	51	“ Glad you could make it . ”
23980	23993	24002	24002	she	568	“ Dr. Harper , it ’s a pleasure to finally meet you . ”

I only told you two months to give me enough time to get the hell out of New York and away from you . There ’s nothing to talk about ! What part of ‘ it ’s over ’ do you not understand ? I do n’t care about your damn excuses and I do n’t want your apology . There is n’t anything in this world that could ever make me forgive you ! If you call or text me again , I will press charges for stalking . I ’m done . It ’s done . This is the last time you will ever hear my voice ! ”

25132	25158	25129	25129	He	51	“ If he did n’t get the hint from that conversation , then he ’s a complete idiot . What did he do to you ? ”
25223	25264	25265	25265	He	51	“ It does n’t matter . What ’s done is done and things are different now . I ’m away from him , he does n’t know where I am , and tomorrow , I ’m changing my phone number . ”

25786	25806	25807	25807	I	0	“ I just do n’t like strangers in my house when I ’m not home . That ’s all . ”
25827	25852	25853	25853	I	0	“ That ’s right , I forgot . We are strangers . For some weird and crazy reason , I thought we were friends . ”
25869	25874	25864	25864	he	585	“ We are friends . ”

26072	26096	26063	26063	I	0	“ No . You were doing eighty - five . If you were doing seventy , I would n’t have pulled you over . ”

26206	26252	26202	26202	His	591	“ Listen , officer . I am really sorry , and I did n’t realize how fast I was going . Back in New York , I rarely drove . You know , with the taxi cabs and subway , not to mention the traffic . ”
26253	26258	26259	26259	he	591	“ Does n’t matter , ”
26265	26287	26259	26259	he	591	“ Grace Harper . This is California you ’re in now and you were exceeding the speed limit by twenty over . ”

26297	26336	26337	26337	He	591	“ People love to tell me that . I ’m sorry , but I ’m going to have to write you a ticket . Let it be a lesson , since you ’re new to driving and all . ”
26360	26367	26368	26368	he	591	“ I ’ll be right back , ”

27884	27918	27838	27838	she	116	“ Seriously , Jamieson . What am I going to do ? I do n’t want a kid . Maybe things would be different if I loved Riley . I barely know her . ”
27919	27943	27944	27944	He	95	“ Then I suggest getting to know her , since she ’s going to be in your life for the next eighteen years . ”

27969	28011	27838	27838	she	116	“ Grace is mad at me because I was going to kick her out this morning before I left for work . Plus , I accidentally said that I do n’t like strangers in the house when I ’m not home . ”
28012	28069	27838	27838	she	116	“ Are you really surprised she ’s mad ? She ’s a woman . They always take things the wrong way . Somehow , it ’s always our fault . Just like Riley getting knocked up . Totally my fault , she said , even though she said it was okay not to use a condom . ”
28070	28080	28081	28081	Paige	116	“ Two scotches and an order of pretzel bites . ”

28126	28164	28121	28121	Logan	95	“ No . Of course not . I like the sex and she ’s a nice girl , but that ’s it . Renata is sending us to Vegas next Thursday to speak at a medical conference . ”
28165	28182	28090	28090	I	0	“ Damn . What I would n’t give to go to that . I love Vegas . ”
28183	28203	28121	28121	Logan	95	“ I just do n’t want things to be awkward with us if we ’re spending the weekend together . ”
28204	28215	28216	28216	Logan	95	“ She ’ll get over it . They always do , ”

28742	28751	28739	28739	she	66	“ How is it going in Los Angeles ? ”
28752	28763	28642	28642	her	66	“ It ’s going okay . The nightmares are back . ”
28764	28782	28724	28724	I	0	“ I figured they would return with you being back there . Is it the same dream ? ”
28783	28793	28739	28739	she	66	“ Yeah . The same exact one as always . ”
28794	28806	28642	28642	her	66	“ I think you should talk to someone there , Grace . ”
28807	28819	28739	28739	she	66	“ I ’m fine , Aunt Cora . They ’ll pass . ”
28852	28861	28862	28862	I	0	“ I ’m sleeping with a guy here , ”
28866	28875	28862	28862	I	0	“ He ’s a neurosurgeon at the hospital . ”
28876	28900	28837	28837	She	66	“ Grace , is that such a good idea ? I do n’t think you ’re ready to get into another relationship yet . ”
28901	28925	28844	28844	she	66	“ I do n’t want a relationship and I ’m not getting into one . Plus , he does n’t want one either . ”
28926	28942	28862	28862	I	0	“ Sounds to me like you ’re using sex with him as a coping mechanism . ”
28943	28949	28837	28837	She	66	“ Are you shrinking me ? ”
28950	29000	28844	28844	she	66	“ Maybe . You ’ve been terribly hurt , and you ’ve just moved back to the place where you experienced traumatic events as a child . You ’re escaping , my love . Every time you have meaningless sex with that man , you ’re escaping your reality . ”
29001	29005	29006	29006	I	0	“ Aunt Cora . ”
29009	29019	29006	29006	I	0	“ Why does everything have to be about psychology ? ”
29020	29033	28844	28844	she	66	“ Because it ’s what makes us who we are , darling . ”
29034	29099	28844	28844	she	66	“ And just for the record , I ’d already slept with him in New York on my last night there . We met in a bar and I was n’t supposed to see him again . I had no idea who he was and that he worked at the hospital here . Imagine the shock on my face when I saw him again . ”
29100	29114	28844	28844	she	66	“ I see . You know , Grace , rebounds never work out . ”
29115	29140	29141	29141	I	0	“ He ’s not a rebound , Aunt Cora . He ’s just a man who ’s amazing in bed and makes me for — ”
29145	29165	29141	29141	I	0	“ Forget your problems ? Forget about Sam ? Forget about what happened to you there twenty years ago ? ”
29183	29190	28844	28844	she	66	“ he ’s not a rebound . ”
29191	29197	29198	29198	I	0	“ I get your point . ”
29201	29234	29198	29198	I	0	“ Just be careful . You need to heal , love , and having sex with this man is n’t going to heal you . It ’s only going to confuse you . ”
29235	29265	29266	29266	I	0	“ I ’ll be careful , and I have to go . It ’s been a long day and I ’m tired . I ’ll talk to you soon . ”
29301	29314	29315	29315	I	0	“ Did you forget to give me one other piece of advice ? ”
29319	29340	29315	29315	I	0	“ Actually , the man you ’re sleeping with , please do n’t tell me it ’s Dr. Jamieson Finn . ”
29341	29350	29381	29381	her	654	“ It is . Do you know him ? ”
29351	29374	29315	29315	I	0	“ I do . We ’ve met on several occasions at Mount Sinai here in New York . Grace , of all — ”
29375	29378	29379	29379	I	0	“ Good . ”
29384	29413	29379	29379	I	0	“ Then you know he ’s not looking for anything . No relationship , no girlfriend , no wife , no strings , nothing . Just meaningless sex . ”
29414	29425	29426	29426	she	654	“ And why do you suppose he ’s like that ? ”
29429	29473	29426	29426	she	654	“ I ’m going to take a wild guess and say that he ’s not facing reality either ? He ’s hiding behind a façade of women and sex ? Maybe stemming from a piss poor childhood ? Mommy issues ? Daddy issues ? ”
29474	29492	29315	29315	I	0	“ Perhaps . Okay , that ’s all I wanted to know . Good night , darling . ”
29493	29523	29315	29315	I	0	“ Wait a minute . You just ca n’t call me and say that . What are your thoughts ? I need to know your thoughts , Aunt Cora . ”
29524	29617	29426	29426	she	654	“ He has a reputation , Grace . But I ’m sure you already know that . Men like Jamieson Finn wo n’t ever change until they work out their own demons . I know you , darling . You ’re a good person with a good heart and a lot of emotions . I do n’t believe you can just have sex with him and not feel something . Like I said , it ’s way too soon for you to be getting involved with anyone , meaningless sex or not . ”

29631	29646	29647	29647	She	655	“ No you wo n’t , Grace . I love you . Good night . ”
29709	29718	29719	29719	I	0	“ Dr. Lasher , where ’s Dr. Finn ? ”
29722	29735	29719	29719	I	0	“ He ’s in New York . He ’s due back today . ”
29740	29754	29736	29736	She	655	“ That ’s odd . I wonder why he did n’t tell me . ”
29755	29770	29771	29771	she	655	“ I do n’t know . Are the two of you seeing each other ? ”
29774	29808	29809	29809	She	655	“ No . I just thought if he was going to be out of town , he ’d at least tell me that he would n’t be here when I needed a consult . ”
29821	29833	29834	29834	Jackie	112	“ You ’re giving Dr. Finn ’s resident the evil eye , ”
29837	29840	29834	29834	Jackie	112	“ Why ? ”
29841	29847	29817	29817	she	655	“ No I ’m not . ”
29848	29853	29854	29854	She	655	“ Yes you are . ”
29857	29862	29854	29854	She	655	“ She ’s pretty . ”
29863	29868	29817	29817	she	655	“ She ’s okay . ”
29869	29888	29817	29817	she	655	“ I know what you ’re thinking . You ’re wondering if her and Jamieson are sleeping together . ”
29889	29926	29854	29854	She	655	“ No , I ’m not . Like I would care anyway . We are n’t a thing . I ’m just a little pissed he did n’t tell me he was going to New York . ”
29927	29945	29946	29946	I	0	“ Why ? If you ’re not a ‘ thing , ’ then why does it matter ? ”
29957	29980	29946	29946	I	0	“ Come on , Grace . Do n’t . You better not be falling for him . You ’ve got that look . ”
29992	30007	30008	30008	I	0	“ I do n’t have a look and I ’m not falling for him , ”
30095	30102	30103	30103	I	0	“ Have you seen Dr. Lasher ? ”
30106	30113	30103	30103	I	0	“ I need a neuro consult . ”

30131	30134	30127	30128	the nurse	667	“ Thanks . ”
30187	30192	30193	30193	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
30196	30260	30193	30193	I	0	“ I thought you were in here sleeping , Dr. Lasher . I need a consult on one of my patients . Please , continue what you were doing . For the record , I ’m not sorry that I interrupted the two of you . Dr. Lasher , the next time you get a page , you better damn well answer it . ”
30384	30394	30395	30395	he	51	“ There you are . We need to talk , ”
30398	30412	30395	30395	he	51	“ But first , who ’s the patient you need a consult on ? ”
30413	30423	30424	30424	I	0	“ We do n’t need to talk about anything , ”
30443	30450	30440	30440	her	301	” I handed it to him . “
30460	30483	30453	30453	you	0	” he asked . I could see Jackie glaring at us from behind the computer screen . She knew something was up . “

30521	30525	30514	30514	I	0	” I smiled . “
30537	30547	30531	30532	Mrs. Carrington	119	” He shot me a look and walked away . “
30555	30563	30531	30532	Mrs. Carrington	119	” Jackie asked in a low voice . “
30583	30584	30564	30564	I	0	” “

32278	32305	32222	32222	She	727	” I shocked her again . We all stared at the monitor and nothing . She was gone and there was nothing left I could do . “
32313	32344	32345	32345	We	733	” I looked at the clock . I slowly shook my head as I removed my gloves and went to see if Grace needed help . * * * * Grace “

32438	32443	32396	32396	We	733	” I shocked him . “

32487	32526	32396	32396	We	733	” I heard a soft voice from the doorway . Holding the paddles in my hand , I looked over and saw a little girl who was about ten years old standing there with tears in her eyes . “
32531	32536	32396	32396	We	733	” she softly spoke . “
32539	32569	32570	32571	Dr. Harper	63	” I froze as I stared into her eyes and swallowed hard . I felt paralyzed as my mind took me back to when I was ten years old . “

32678	32691	32676	32676	Grace	63	” Jamieson spoke as he lightly placed his hand on my arm . “
32696	32707	32692	32692	He	740	” I turned as my teary eyes stared into his . “

32735	32772	32773	32773	You	63	” I shouted as I continued chest compressions . Staring at the monitor , he was still flatlined . All I kept seeing in my mind was that little girl who had already lost her mother . “

36849	36861	36846	36846	I	0	“ You did n’t feel the need to tell me that ? ”
36862	36881	36882	36882	I	0	“ To be honest , I did n’t think about it . Why ? Do you know her ? ”
36892	36925	36882	36882	I	0	“ Yes , of course I know her . We ’ve worked together at Mount - Sinai . She ’s a great woman and an excellent psychiatrist . She never mentioned you . ”
36926	36943	36998	36998	he	107	“ She ’s a private person . Did you ever talk about personal things with her ? ”
36944	36947	36882	36882	I	0	“ No . ”
36948	36962	36882	36882	I	0	“ That ’s why . Let ’s go eat . I ’m starving . ”
36989	36994	36981	36982	Robert Conway	107	“ There she is . ”
37004	37009	36998	36998	he	107	“ Hello , Robert . ”
37018	37036	37013	37013	he	107	“ It ’s good to see you , baby girl . It ’s been far too long . “
37049	37058	37013	37013	he	107	” he spoke as he extended his hand . “
37067	37068	37065	37065	Robert	107	” “
37073	37082	37065	37065	Robert	107	” He placed his hands on my shoulder . “
37102	37103	37100	37100	Jamieson	51	” “
37109	37110	37106	37106	She	822	” “
37159	37160	37146	37146	I	0	” “
37171	37175	37165	37165	Robert	107	” I grinned . “
37196	37208	37190	37191	Dr. Finn	51	” He looked at his watch and then kissed my cheek . “
37228	37238	37240	37240	we	823	” He pointed to us as he walked away . “
37242	37294	37240	37240	we	823	” Jamieson gestured with his hand towards Eddie V ’s restaurant . As soon as we sat down , Jamieson ordered a scotch and I ordered a glass of wine . It felt good to be able to drink without any worry of being called into the hospital for an emergency . “
37304	37314	37240	37240	we	823	” He grinned as he held up his glass . “
37318	37371	37240	37240	we	823	” I smiled as I lightly tapped mine against his . We were eating and making small talk about surgeries . The women who passed by our table gawked at the hotness sitting across from me and the small flirty smiles he gave back . It was irritating to say the least . “
37380	37384	37378	37378	you	824	” I spoke . “
37390	37394	37400	37400	women	1975	” He chuckled . “
37402	37403	37404	37404	It	826	” “
37409	37418	37404	37404	It	826	” A smirk crossed his perfectly shaped lips . “
37435	37436	37404	37404	It	826	” “
37442	37470	37404	37404	It	826	” He sighed . All of a sudden , Jamieson ’s face turned pale as he stared at the man and woman who were approaching our table . “
37475	37476	37477	37477	Dad	134	” “
37492	37493	37496	37496	Jamieson	51	” “
37498	37502	37496	37496	Jamieson	51	” Tracy smiled . “
37515	37531	37512	37512	you	824	” His eyes turned to me . I politely smiled as I extended my hand . “
37545	37546	37547	37547	Grace	110	” “
37564	37565	37562	37562	Tracy	135	” “

37596	37600	37584	37584	Jamieson	51	” Tracy spoke . “
37612	37650	37605	37605	I	0	” he spoke deadpan . The tension in the air was so thick , you could n’t cut it with a sword . I got the feeling there was no love lost between either one of them . “
37667	37668	37665	37665	Grace	63	” “
37681	37695	37678	37679	Dr. Finn	51	” He looked at Jamieson , who was staring off to the side . “
37704	37710	37711	37711	We	833	” he asked his father . “
37742	37750	37711	37711	We	833	” Jamieson took in a sharp breath . “
37760	37788	37757	37757	your	51	” Carlyle spoke as he walked away . Jamieson rolled his eyes as he picked up his scotch and threw it down the back of his throat . “
37802	37806	37797	37800	a family of doctors	836	” I spoke . “
37812	37813	37810	37810	he	837	” “
37848	37849	37879	37879	he	837	” “

37917	37918	37915	37915	you	51	” “
37926	37934	37879	37879	he	837	” he spoke in a harsh tone . “
37939	37946	37879	37879	he	837	” I finished off my wine . “
37951	37955	37948	37948	you	51	” he asked . “
37959	37963	37948	37948	you	51	” I smirked . “
37971	37991	37992	37992	I	0	” After Jamieson paid the bill , we headed to the casino and sat down at a blackjack table . “
38010	38016	38002	38002	you	51	” I asked the dealer . “
38027	38046	38021	38021	I	0	” He smiled . The dealer gave an explanation while Jamieson stared at me with a steady gaze . “
38049	38050	38021	38021	I	0	” “
38060	38085	38058	38058	you	51	” The table was full , and the cards were dealt . I watched carefully and made sure I lost the first five hands . “
38094	38098	38086	38086	You	0	” Jamieson spoke . “
38101	38108	38109	38109	I	0	” I glanced over at him . “
38121	38147	38111	38111	I	0	” His eye narrowed at me . I placed my bet , and the cards were dealt . The dealer lost , and I won . “
38150	38156	38111	38111	I	0	” I spoke with excitement . “
38160	38221	38111	38111	I	0	” Placing another bet , I doubled it , and I won again . I let myself win three hands in a row , pulled back on my bet , and made sure to lose the next four . I was up over two thousand dollars , and when the last hand was dealt , I made sure to lose . “
38228	38232	38111	38111	I	0	” Jamieson spoke . “
38243	38274	38239	38239	I	0	” I smiled . We got up from our seats and Jamieson lightly placed his hand on my elbow . Leaning closer to me , he whispered in my ear . “
38287	38300	38281	38281	You	0	” I raised my brow with a smile as we kept walking . “
38312	38316	38302	38302	you	0	” he asked . “
38327	38328	38302	38302	you	0	” “
38332	38332	38302	38302	you	0	”
38400	38409	38392	38392	I	0	“ Let ’s go back to my room . ”
38410	38417	38392	38392	I	0	“ I ca n’t , Jamieson . ”
38418	38429	38430	38430	I	0	“ Sure you can . I know you want to . ”
38449	38454	38455	38455	She	63	“ I ca n’t . ”
38463	38468	38457	38457	her	63	“ Whatever , Grace . ”
38474	38513	38469	38469	I	0	“ I do n’t know what the fuck your problem is . You ’re acting like a goddamn child . You know what ? From now on , we ’re just co - workers . That ’s it . ”
38544	38572	38573	38573	I	0	“ Because I wo n’t have sex with you , we ’re not friends ? Are you serious right now ? What kind of man are you ? ”
38583	38590	38591	38591	I	0	“ A man who has needs . ”
38599	38632	38591	38591	I	0	“ And if you do n’t want to fulfill those needs , then I ’ll find someone who will . But if you want the truth , I ’d rather fuck you . ”
38633	38657	38748	38748	She	853	“ Oh my God , you are so crass . I ca n’t even believe I slept with you in the first place . ”
38658	38739	38748	38748	She	853	“ Well , you did , and I know you enjoyed it just as much as I did ! So honestly , I do n’t understand what the fuck the problem is here , Grace . We ’re two adults not looking for anything but sex . Unless you ’re looking for more . Even though you say you are n’t , I think you are and that ’s why you got so mad when you saw me and Rebecca . ”
38740	38747	38748	38748	She	853	“ You do n’t know shit ! ”
38753	38802	38748	38748	She	853	“ That ’s the problem with you women . You always want more . You just ca n’t be satisfied with the sex like men can . This is the exact reason why I do n’t get involved in relationships . Too many complications and too many expectations . ”
38803	38825	38748	38748	She	853	“ You have no clue how he hurt me , and that ’s not just something I can forget so easily . ”
38826	38894	38968	38968	her	854	“ Come on , Grace . He hurt your ego . That ’s all . He cheated on you with another woman . The guy is an asshole for doing that to you . The least he could have done was break it off with you . I do n’t understand that whole thing . If someone is unhappy in the relationship , break it off first . ”
38895	38924	38748	38748	She	853	“ So you ’re saying that if you were in a relationship and unhappy , you ’d break up with the person first instead of cheating on her ? ”
38925	38946	38968	38968	her	854	“ Yeah . I would . But , see , I do n’t put myself in that kind of position . ”
38947	38964	38965	38965	I	0	“ What happened to you as a child for you to be so anti - relationship ? ”
39018	39046	39012	39012	I	0	“ Nothing . It ’s just the way I am . Now , if we ’re not going to fuck , then you can leave my room . ”
39090	39158	39159	39159	She	854	“ He did n’t cheat on me . I was the other woman for over a year . He was married and I never knew . He was that good of a liar and lived a double life . He broke me , and I need to put myself back together before even thinking about being involved with another man . Even if it ’s just sex . ”
39298	39301	39302	39302	He	51	“ Truce ? ”
39307	39310	39304	39304	his	51	“ Whatever . ”
39322	39337	39311	39311	I	0	“ Grace , I ’m going to do something I do n’t ever do . ”
39338	39344	39345	39345	I	0	“ And what ’s that ? ”
39352	39385	39345	39345	I	0	“ I ’m going to apologize for last night . I had no idea that the douchebag was married . I ca n’t even imagine what you felt when you found out . ”
39545	39548	39549	39549	he	51	“ Grace , ”
39780	39795	39796	39796	He	51	“ Shit . We better hurry up . We ’re going to be late . ”
39926	39936	39916	39916	his	51	“ This is the last time , Dr. Finn . ”
39937	39943	39944	39944	He	51	“ If you say so . ”
40113	40117	40118	40118	I	0	“ Great presentation . ”
40123	40139	40118	40118	I	0	“ Thanks . I ’m going to go and grab some coffee . Good luck . ”
40183	40216	40181	40181	Cora	66	“ Happy birthday , my love . I know you hate this day , but please , have some fun . You ’re in Vegas , after all . I love you . ”
40501	40513	40514	40514	I	0	“ You up for getting rip - roaring drunk with me ? ”
40517	40527	40514	40514	I	0	“ Seriously ? You ’re going to get drunk ? ”
40528	40537	40484	40485	Grace Jamieson	138	“ You bet I am . You in ? ”
40538	40545	40546	40546	He	875	“ Yeah . I ’m in . ”
40549	40572	40546	40546	He	875	“ Great . Give me about twenty - minutes and I ’ll meet you at the pool . We can start there . ”
40573	40579	40546	40546	He	875	“ I ’ll be waiting . ”
40696	40713	40714	40714	I	0	“ So what are your families going to say when you tell them you got married ? ”
40718	40792	40714	40714	I	0	“ They wo n’t be happy , but we do n’t care . They ’re the reason we ’ve decided to do this . They were making our wedding out to be about them and now both sides are arguing over the stupidest things . It ’s as if our opinion did n’t matter . My father said as long as he was paying for it , they ’d do what they wanted . ”
40793	40797	40798	40798	I	0	“ Sounds awful , ”
40801	40813	40798	40798	I	0	“ So how long have the two of you been together ? ”
40818	40826	40827	40827	He	140	“ Oh , we ’re not together . ”
40830	40848	40827	40827	He	140	“ We work together . We both were speakers at the medical conference here in the hotel . ”
40849	40856	40857	40857	Mandy	139	“ So you ’re both doctors ? ”
40860	40872	40873	40873	I	0	“ I ’m a trauma surgeon and he ’s a neurosurgeon , ”
40876	40879	40880	40880	Greg	140	“ Damn , ”
40883	40901	40902	40902	Mandy	139	“ We totally thought the two of you were a couple . You ’re so cute together . ”
40905	40913	40914	40914	Jamieson	138	“ No . No couple for us , ”
40923	40927	40928	40928	he	883	“ Another round ? ”
41173	41176	41177	41177	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
41303	41307	41308	41308	he	141	“ Dr. Collins , ”
41311	41335	41308	41308	he	141	“ Stuart , it ’s Jamieson . I need you to bring me two banana bags to the Venetian Hotel , and quickly . ”
41349	41355	41336	41336	I	0	“ Room 3025 . Stat ! ”
41356	41364	41365	41365	He	141	“ Too much to drink last night ? ”
41369	41375	41365	41365	He	141	“ You could say that . ”
41376	41386	41336	41336	I	0	“ I should be there in about fifteen minutes . ”
41387	41397	41398	41398	I	0	“ Thanks , Stuart . I owe you one . ”
41409	41416	41417	41417	Grace	138	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
41420	41443	41417	41417	Grace	138	“ Stuart Collins . He ’s going to bring us banana bags in about fifteen minutes . You need one , right ? ”
41444	41455	41456	41456	she	138	“ Fuck yes . I feel like I ’m dying , ”
41460	41466	41456	41456	she	138	“ Yeah , me too . ”
41467	41489	41490	41490	she	138	“ I remember nothing about last night . And I ’m sorry to say I do n’t remember us having sex , ”
41493	41505	41490	41490	she	138	“ I do n’t either . So do n’t feel bad . ”
41506	41514	41515	41515	she	138	“ You used a condom , right ? ”
41518	41528	41515	41515	she	138	“ To be honest , I do n’t know . ”
41543	41549	41537	41537	her	138	“ What time is it ? ”
41559	41563	41550	41550	I	0	“ Eleven o’clock . ”

41596	41609	41610	41610	she	138	“ Who is Stuart Collins and how does he have banana bags ? ”
41619	41643	41610	41610	she	138	“ He was one of my residents a couple of years ago . He works at the hospital not too far from here . ”
41677	41687	41688	41688	Stuart	141	“ Damn , Jamieson , you look like shit . ”
41691	41710	41688	41688	Stuart	141	“ Thanks . Good to see you too . Come on in . Do Grace over there first . ”
41711	41740	41776	41776	he	141	“ Hi , I ’m Doctor Collins . No worries , Grace . I ’m going to pump you full of fluids to help speed up your recovery . ”
41741	41759	41776	41776	he	141	“ I know what a banana bag is , Dr. Collins . I ’m a trauma surgeon . ”
41760	41772	41776	41776	he	141	“ Oh . Well , it ’s nice to meet you . ”

41823	41838	41839	41839	Grace	138	“ Because you ’re both wearing the same gold bands on your left hand . ”
41917	41928	41929	41929	Stuart	141	“ Grace , I need you to take deep breaths , ”
41942	41947	41932	41932	he	141	“ Look at me . ”
41965	41971	41972	41972	Stuart	141	“ Slow , deep breaths , ”
41975	41983	41984	41984	he	141	“ There you go . Better now ? ”
41997	42027	41987	41987	I	0	“ A drunk marriage . I see it all the time at the hospital . I better get going . I think the two of you need to talk . ”

42140	42158	42137	42137	I	0	“ Let ’s just go to sleep and we ’ll figure this out when we wake up . ”
42159	42163	42164	42164	Jamieson	138	“ Good idea , ”
42167	42180	42164	42164	Jamieson	138	“ Because , right now , I ca n’t deal with this . ”

42386	42430	42460	42460	Jamieson	138	“ Fuck no ! This is bullshit and I know it ’s some kind of joke . We both just need to calm down , get dressed , and head over to this Little Vegas Chapel and find out what the fuck happened . ”
42431	42440	42441	42441	I	0	“ We are both wearing gold wedding bands ! ”
42475	42500	42460	42460	Jamieson	138	“ Listen , Grace . Let ’s not panic or lose our shit just yet until we find out exactly what happened last night . ”
42559	42567	42568	42568	Jamieson	138	“ What the hell are you doing ? ”
42571	42582	42583	42583	I	0	“ Looking for the condom . The wrapper . Anything ! ”
42586	42599	42583	42583	I	0	“ There ’s nothing . No sign of any condom being used ! ”
42600	42603	42617	42617	him	902	“ Grace — ”
42604	42613	42614	42614	I	0	“ Do n’t . Do n’t say it ! ”
42619	42660	42614	42614	I	0	“ Who knows how many times we had sex last night . Neither one of us even remembers doing it . In fact , I ’m shocked you could even get it up with as much alcohol as you drank . ”
42661	42673	42617	42617	him	902	“ I can always get it up , no matter what . ”
42674	42682	42617	42617	him	902	“ Oh , I bet you can ! ”
42683	42690	42691	42691	he	902	“ Are you on birth control ? ”
42698	42704	42691	42691	he	902	“ Yes . Of course . ”
42705	42713	42617	42617	him	902	“ Then what are you worried about ? ”
42714	42721	42722	42722	I	0	“ What am I worried about ? ”
42733	42764	42765	42765	I	0	“ I ’m worried about contracting an STD , you idiot ! God knows you ’ve slept with half the hospital and probably all of Los Angeles and New York ! ”
42768	42776	42777	42777	he	902	“ Okay . Just stop right there ! ”
42780	42809	42777	42777	he	902	“ I do not have an STD . That I can guarantee . I ’ve never in my life not used a condom with a woman . EVER ! ”
42810	42820	42821	42821	I	0	“ Ha . I find that hard to believe . ”
42838	42864	42835	42835	his	902	“ I do n’t care if you believe me or not . I ’m one hundred percent clean . Get dressed so we can go . ”
42909	42916	42917	42917	I	0	“ Mandy . Greg . Wait ! ”
42920	42932	42933	42933	Mandy	139	“ Hey , you two ! What a great day yesterday , ”
42936	42942	42933	42933	Mandy	139	“ How was Criss Angel ? ”
42943	42963	42964	42964	Jamieson	138	“ We do n’t remember . In fact , we were hoping you could tell us what we did , ”
42967	43012	43013	43013	Greg	140	“ We do n’t know , Jamieson . We parted ways after dinner because we had to be at the chapel and you guys were going to try and get tickets to see Criss Angel . That was the last we saw of you , ”
43016	43022	43013	43013	Greg	140	“ What ’s going on ? ”
43023	43039	43040	43040	I	0	“ We just woke up very hungover and ca n’t remember much about last night , ”
43043	43057	43058	43058	Mandy	139	“ Well , obviously , the three of you had a great time . ”
43061	43067	43068	43068	Jamieson	138	“ The three of us ? ”
43071	43080	43068	43068	Jamieson	138	“ You , Grace , and the alcohol . ”
43084	43107	43081	43081	Greg	140	“ Anyway , we have to head to the airport . Let ’s meet up in Los Angeles for dinner one night . ”
43148	43172	43145	43145	his	915	“ Hello again . How ’s the happy couple ? I ’m assuming you ’re here to pick up your proof of marriage ? ”
43173	43181	43182	43182	I	0	“ We need to talk to you , ”
43189	43196	43182	43182	I	0	“ Sure . Come with me . ”
43217	43223	43224	43224	he	915	“ What ’s going on ? ”
43227	43238	43239	43239	Jamieson	138	“ That ’s what we need you to tell us , ”
43242	43252	43253	43253	He	915	“ Somehow I knew this was going to happen . ”
43256	43271	43253	43253	He	915	“ Let me guess , you have no recollection of getting hitched last night ? ”
43272	43279	43280	43280	Jamieson	138	“ No , we do n’t ! ”
43287	43390	43280	43280	Jamieson	138	“ You both came in here last night , drunk off your asses . At first , I refused to marry you . I even told you to come back today if you still wanted to get married , when you were sober , and I ’d marry you . But you insisted . You both said you were sure you wanted it and you even signed a liability contract stating that the Little Vegas Chapel would not be held responsible because you both were intoxicated . It is a legally binding contract . In fact , your wedding photos are ready . ”
43443	43448	43449	43449	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
43452	43456	43457	43457	Jamieson	138	“ Fuck me , ”
43489	43497	43457	43457	Jamieson	138	“ Where did I get that veil ? ”
43498	43505	43460	43460	he	917	“ You rented it from us . ”
43506	43511	43462	43462	his	917	“ And the flowers ? ”
43512	43516	43457	43457	Jamieson	138	“ From us . ”
43517	43522	43523	43523	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
43531	43542	43543	43543	Jamieson	138	“ What about the gold bands we were both wearing ? ”
43546	43554	43543	43543	Jamieson	138	“ We sell rings here as well . ”
43555	43578	43579	43579	Jamieson	138	“ So you ’re telling us that this is all real ? We came to this place last night and got married ? ”
43582	43605	43579	43579	Jamieson	138	“ Yes . Clearly , the two of you are regretting it now . Good thing I had you sign that contract . ”
43606	43612	43613	43613	Jamieson	138	“ This is absolutely ridiculous ! ”
43616	43628	43613	43613	Jamieson	138	“ There should be laws about marrying people who are inebriated . ”
43629	43710	43579	43579	Jamieson	138	“ Listen , you two . You made a mistake . It happens . But there ’s nothing to worry about . As soon as you get home , you go to the courthouse and have the marriage annulled . It ’ll be as if it never happened and the two of you can go your separate ways . I ’m sorry about this , but I tried to discourage you last night , considering the state you were in . ”
43711	43715	43716	43716	Jamieson	138	“ Thank you , ”
43726	43735	43719	43719	he	920	“ I apologize if we were any trouble . ”
43736	43768	43769	43769	He	920	“ Nah . You two were cute and very persistent . Sometimes the subconscious mind has a way of telling you things that your conscious mind does n’t want to know . ”
43772	43784	43785	43785	Jamieson	138	“ Trust us . This is something neither of us wanted , ”
43801	43811	43812	43812	He	920	“ This is just great . Just fucking great . ”
43835	43844	43824	43824	I	0	“ Are n’t you going to say anything ? ”
43845	43861	43862	43862	I	0	“ What do you want me say , Jamieson ? We got married , woohoo ! ”
43871	43895	43862	43862	I	0	“ I ’m just as sick about it as you are , but we can fix this . You heard what he said . ”
43896	43920	43921	43921	We	924	“ Damn right we ’re going to fix it . I ’m calling my attorney the second we get back to the hotel . ”
43935	43966	43927	43927	Jamieson	138	“ Come back to the room with me and I ’ll call my attorney . We ’ll talk to him and see how quickly we can get this marriage annulled . ”
43986	43997	43978	43978	I	0	“ Jamieson . To what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
43998	44028	43971	43971	Jamieson	138	“ Tony , I need your help . I ’m going to put you on speaker because Dr. Grace Harper is with me and this involves her as well . ”
44029	44037	44038	44038	I	0	“ Okay . What ’s going on ? ”
44058	44111	44038	44038	I	0	“ Grace and I are in Vegas for a medical conference . We both partied a little too much yesterday and ended up at a wedding chapel . When we woke up this morning , we discovered that we involuntarily got married . We need this marriage annulled as soon as possible . ”
44112	44131	43971	43971	Jamieson	138	“ Oh . I see . So , just to be clear , neither party wanted this marriage ? ”
44132	44135	44038	44038	I	0	“ No , ”
44144	44182	44136	44136	we	929	“ I ’ll get the paperwork started , but I ca n’t turn it in until Monday morning . I ’ll put a rush on it and I ’ll call you as soon as I hear something . ”
44183	44188	43971	43971	Jamieson	138	“ Thanks , Tony . ”
44189	44218	43971	43971	Jamieson	138	“ No problem , Jamieson . I have to be honest , I ’m a little shocked right now . Of all people calling me with this news . ”
44219	44231	44136	44136	we	929	“ I know . Just call me Monday with an update . ”
44232	44249	44250	44250	I	0	“ I will . Do n’t worry . We ’ll get this taken care of quickly . ”
44266	44274	44275	44275	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare start crying , ”
44282	44297	44275	44275	I	0	“ You do n’t get to cry . This was as much your fault . ”
44298	44308	44136	44136	we	929	“ My fault ? Who paid for the wedding ? ”
44309	44319	44320	44320	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Maybe you did , ”
44323	44335	44320	44320	I	0	“ Neither one of us remembers jack shit from last night . ”
44336	44357	44358	44358	she	138	“ Well , if you were any kind of man , you would n’t have let me pay for it , ”
44365	44388	44358	44358	she	138	“ Why not ? Do n’t women have equal rights ? Why the hell does the man have to pay for everything ? ”
44389	44400	44136	44136	we	929	“ Oh my God , are you serious right now ? ”
44401	44407	44408	44408	I	0	“ Yeah . I am ! ”
44411	44430	44408	44408	I	0	“ You have no idea how I feel about this . It makes me sick to my stomach . ”
44431	44448	44136	44136	we	929	“ Oh , I ’m so sorry that being married to me makes you so sick . ”
44449	44501	44136	44136	we	929	“ Grace , you know what I mean . You feel it too . Do n’t deny it . This was n’t supposed to be a part of my life . I was never getting married to anyone ! I do n’t do marriage and I certainly do n’t do family . ”
44502	44553	44408	44408	I	0	“ Yeah , I know you do n’t do family . Anyone could tell there was no love lost between you and your father . And who knows about your mother because you refuse to talk about her . So obviously , your relationship is just as bad with her . ”
44554	44573	44574	44574	I	0	“ Shut your mouth ! You do n’t ever mention my mother again . Do you understand me ? ”
44577	44590	44574	44574	I	0	“ You have no idea what the hell you ’re talking about . ”
44591	44626	44627	44627	She	930	“ Well , my parents are dead , and I would give anything to have them back , even if our relationship was n’t so great . My life is so fucked . God . ”
44641	44747	44635	44635	she	930	“ Of all days . Of all days for this to happen . If it was any other day , I could forget about it . But not yesterday . See , the thing is , Jamieson , once this marriage is voided and as if it never existed , the day will be a distant memory for you . In fact , probably this time next year , you wo n’t even remember that it ever happened . But for me , it will always be in my memory . Every single year for the rest of my life , I will remember this . ”
44748	44773	44635	44635	she	930	“ Jesus Christ , Grace , drama queen much ? It ’s just a goddamn day . You ’ll forget all about it too . ”
44774	44793	44794	44794	she	930	“ No ! No I wo n’t , because yesterday was n’t just another goddamn day . UGH ! ”
44797	44823	44794	44794	she	930	“ Okay , you need to calm the fuck down . What is the problem with yesterday besides us making the stupid mistake we did ? ”
44824	44886	44887	44887	she	930	“ Yesterday was my birthday and the day my parents died . So now , it ’s become my birthday , the day my parents died , and my fucking wedding day to a man I barely know ! A day that is supposed to be special . A fairytale , a goddamn fairytale , and it ’s all your fault ! ”
44899	44920	44890	44890	I	0	“ Do n’t try to pin this on me . For all I know , this is all your fault ! ”
44930	44981	44982	44982	She	930	“ Grace , listen . I ’m sorry . This is n’t one of our faults . It ’s both of ours . We were both highly intoxicated and neither one of us were of sound mind . So can we at least agree that we are both to blame ? ”
44994	45005	44982	44982	She	930	“ You ’re right . We ’re both to blame . ”
45006	45018	45019	45019	I	0	“ Why did n’t you tell me it was your birthday ? ”
45031	45103	45023	45023	I	0	“ Because I do n’t celebrate it and I have n’t since I was ten years old . A birthday is supposed to be a celebration of your life , but instead , my birthday is the mourning of my parents ’ death . That day , my tenth birthday , started out as a celebration and ended in tragedy , and that is something I never will forget or celebrate . ”
45151	45270	45276	45276	she	933	“ I think it ’s best if we just go our separate ways now and we agree not to mention a word of this to anyone . I mean no one . Not even your Aunt Cora . We ’ll pretend it never happened and it ’ll be taken care of soon . I also think it ’s best if we stay out of each other ’s way from now on . Of course , we ’ll run into each other at the hospital , but we just need to keep it on a professional level . There will be no more sex or even friendly conversations . I ’m not sure we can even be friends anymore . ”
45286	45317	45318	45318	She	933	“ I never should have moved back to Los Angeles . I have done nothing but make one stupid decision after another . I never should have broken my rule . ”
45538	45541	45542	45542	I	0	“ Hello , ”
45549	45556	45542	45542	I	0	“ Grace ? What ’s wrong ? ”
45557	45563	45564	45564	I	0	“ Nothing , Aunt Cora . ”
45570	45575	45564	45564	I	0	“ How are you ? ”
45576	45588	45542	45542	I	0	“ I ’m fine , darling . How ’s Vegas going ? ”
45589	45597	45564	45564	I	0	“ Actually , I just got home . ”
45598	45614	45564	45564	I	0	“ Why ? I thought you were n’t supposed to be home until tomorrow evening ? ”
45615	45640	45542	45542	I	0	“ I came home a day early because I ’m not feeling well . I think I might have caught a bug or something . ”
45641	45647	45648	45648	She	66	“ Grace , what happened ? ”
45656	45659	45660	45660	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
45666	45679	45660	45660	I	0	“ I need to go lie down now . I ’m exhausted . ”
45680	45696	45648	45648	She	66	“ Alright . I hope you feel better soon . Call me later , please . ”
45697	45701	45660	45660	I	0	“ I will . ”
45821	45836	45811	45811	Grace	138	“ Hey , we need to head to the airport . Are you ready ? ”
45837	45849	45850	45850	I	0	“ I flew out last night . I ’m already home . ”
45876	45896	45867	45867	she	138	“ You could n’t shoot me a text message and tell me that ? I was waiting on you . ”
45897	45919	45920	45920	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , but why would I ? You made it very clear that we are no longer friends . ”
46038	46050	46026	46026	I	0	“ Come on in . I ’m up on the rooftop . ”
46051	46059	46060	46060	he	95	“ What are you doing up here ? ”
46063	46074	46060	46060	he	95	“ Thinking . How did you know I was back ? ”
46075	46093	46026	46026	I	0	“ I was driving by and I saw your car in the driveway . How was Vegas ? ”
46094	46097	46098	46098	I	0	“ Eventful , ”
46107	46123	46101	46101	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? You seem like you ’re in a bad mood . ”
46124	46146	46026	46026	I	0	“ Damn it . What I ’m about to tell you can not leave this rooftop . Do you understand me ? ”
46147	46167	46168	46168	I	0	“ Of course , Jamieson . You know you can trust me . What the hell is going on ? ”
46183	46187	46188	46188	I	0	“ I — I. ”
46191	46209	46188	46188	I	0	“ Jamieson . What the hell happened ? You ’re kind of freaking me out right now . ”
46210	46228	46229	46229	I	0	“ I did something so stupid . So incredibly stupid that I still ca n’t believe it , ”
46236	46239	46229	46229	I	0	“ Okay . ”
46248	46256	46240	46240	He	950	“ Calm down and talk to me . ”
46257	46292	46188	46188	I	0	“ Friday after the conference , Grace and I drank all day long . We were so wasted , and when we woke up the next morning , we discovered that we got married . ”
46293	46296	46297	46297	He	950	“ What ? ”
46302	46312	46297	46297	He	950	“ You ’re such a jokester . Stop it ! ”
46313	46339	46345	46345	he	950	“ I ’m not joking , Logan . It happened and it ’s real . Apparently , we got married at the Little Vegas Chapel . ”
46353	46362	46345	46345	he	950	“ You ’re not kidding , are you ? ”
46371	46379	46366	46366	his	950	“ No . I wish I was . ”
46380	46390	46297	46297	He	950	“ For fuck sakes , Jamieson . Now what ? ”
46391	46428	46366	46366	his	950	“ My lawyer is preparing the paperwork for an annulment . I told him to put a rush on it . The faster we get this done , the faster I can put this behind me . ”
46429	46439	46366	46366	his	950	“ What about Grace ? Is she in agreement ? ”
46440	46453	46297	46297	He	950	“ Of course she is . She does n’t want this either . ”
46454	46464	46465	46465	he	950	“ And you have no clue how it happened ? ”
46468	46486	46465	46465	he	950	“ No , and neither does she . Like I said , we were both so intoxicated . ”
46487	46539	46297	46297	He	950	“ Look on the bright side . This will be over within a matter of days and you can just go on as if it never happened . At least you did n’t get her pregnant . Alcohol is the devil , bro . Shit . I ca n’t believe this . ”
46540	46555	46297	46297	He	950	“ Remember what I told you . Not a word of this to anyone . ”
46556	46585	46297	46297	He	950	“ Scouts honor . I swear I wo n’t tell a soul . But what about Grace ? How do you know she ’ll keep her mouth shut ? ”
46586	46600	46297	46297	He	950	“ She will . She does n’t want anyone knowing about this either . ”
46601	46615	46297	46297	He	950	“ So , what ’s going on with the two of you now ? ”
46616	46653	46297	46297	He	950	“ I told her that our relationship is strictly on a professional level and we wo n’t be having sex again . I told her that I did n’t think we could even be friends anymore . ”
46654	46673	46297	46297	He	950	“ Damn , Jamieson . It ’s almost as if you ’re blaming her for this whole thing . ”
46674	46711	46297	46297	He	950	“ I ’m not blaming her . Ever since she got here , things have been off , and I just think it ’s best that we stay out of each other ’s life and way . ”
46712	46754	46755	46755	He	951	“ That ’s a little harsh , do n’t you think ? Grace is a great woman . You both made a drunken mistake . I do n’t think that ’s a reason just to cut her out of your life . ”
46765	46780	46755	46755	He	951	“ Unless you ’ve developed feelings for her and you ca n’t handle it . ”
46781	46810	46297	46297	He	950	“ Do n’t be an idiot . I have no feelings for Grace whatsoever . She ’s just like all the rest of the women I sleep with . ”
46811	46821	46297	46297	He	950	“ Are you trying to convince me or yourself ? ”
46822	46859	46755	46755	He	951	“ I ’m not trying to convince anyone . It ’s a straight - up fact . Now , if we ’re done here , I ’m heading to the hospital to work on my research . ”
46860	46894	46895	46895	He	952	“ Yeah . Okay . Call me later and maybe we can grab a couple of drinks . Or not . I would hate to wake up tomorrow morning and we ’re married . ”
46898	46906	46755	46755	He	951	“ Get the hell out of here ! ”
46912	46922	46923	46923	My	0	“ Aunt Cora , what are you doing here ? ”
46935	46945	46927	46927	I	0	“ I came to see how you were feeling . ”
46952	46974	46946	46946	Her	138	“ You flew all the way from New York just to see how I was feeling ? You could have called . ”
46975	47016	47017	47017	She	138	“ I know I could have , but I had to see for myself . You ca n’t hide anything from me , Grace . You never could . What happened in Las Vegas that you are n’t telling me ? ”
47033	47040	47041	47041	She	138	“ Wow , this is nice . ”
47048	47056	47044	47044	she	138	“ Can I make you some tea ? ”
47066	47083	47057	47057	I	0	“ Only if you ’re having some . I was up all night worried about you . ”
47084	47103	47104	47104	I	0	“ Well , that was dumb . You should n’t be worried about me . I ’m fine , ”
47115	47129	47130	47130	She	138	“ I ca n’t help it , darling . You ’re my daughter . ”
47133	47144	47130	47130	She	138	“ Does it have something to do with your birthday ? ”
47159	47166	47167	47167	She	138	“ It ’s okay , sweetheart . ”
47177	47188	47172	47172	her	138	“ Whatever happened , it ca n’t be that bad . ”
47189	47204	47205	47205	She	138	“ Oh , but it is , and I ’m scared to tell you . ”
47215	47229	47205	47205	She	138	“ Take in a long deep breath . Come on . Do it . ”
47236	47240	47241	47241	she	138	“ Another one , ”
47255	47269	47244	47244	I	0	“ One more . Good girl . Now , tell me what happened . ”
47297	47360	47279	47279	I	0	“ After the conference Friday , Jamieson and I hung out all day . We drank a lot . It was my idea because I just wanted to forget about that day . I needed to forget . We both drank an obscene amount of alcohol and the next morning when we woke up , we found out that we were married . ”
47361	47365	47366	47366	she	138	“ WHAT ? ! ”
47377	47399	47369	47369	she	138	“ I told you I was scared to tell you . Do n’t make it any worse than it already is . ”
47405	47417	47369	47369	she	138	“ Grace Elizabeth Harper . How the hell did that happen ? ”
47418	47430	47431	47431	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Neither one of us remembers , ”
47434	47451	47431	47431	I	0	“ Aunt Cora , my life is so fucked up . What is wrong with me ? ”
47452	47461	47462	47462	she	138	“ Nothing is wrong with you , darling , ”
47472	47487	47465	47465	she	138	“ You ’re just going through a difficult time and you did something stupid . ”
47513	47517	47509	47509	she	138	“ Aunt Cora ? ”
47518	47541	47542	47542	She	138	“ I ’m sorry , Grace . But if you really stop to think about it , you ’re Mrs. Jamieson Finn . ”
47546	47561	47542	47542	She	138	“ Of all people . Oh my goodness , I can imagine him now . ”
47562	47568	47509	47509	she	138	“ This is n’t funny ! ”
47569	47586	47509	47509	she	138	“ No , of course it is n’t . I ’m sorry . So now what ? ”
47587	47623	47542	47542	She	138	“ Jamieson called his lawyer and we ’re getting the marriage annulled as soon as possible . You ca n’t tell anyone about this . Please . I promised Jamieson I would n’t tell anyone . ”
47624	47640	47509	47509	she	138	“ Do n’t you worry about that . By the way , where is Jamieson ? ”
47641	47667	47509	47509	she	138	“ I do n’t know . He told me that we ca n’t be friends anymore and our relationship from now on is strictly professional . ”
47668	47680	47509	47509	she	138	“ And how did you feel when he told you that ? ”
47681	47740	47741	47741	I	0	“ A little hurt and confused . I told him that it was not only my birthday , but also the day my parents died . He did n’t say anything but that we needed to stay out of each other ’s way . How could he be so heartless ? Do you know anything about his family ? ”
47744	47783	47741	47741	I	0	“ No . I ca n’t say that I do . The only thing I know is that his father has his own urology practice in Beverly Hills . I do know that he is an only child . ”
47784	47833	47509	47509	she	138	“ We ran into his father and step - mother in Las Vegas and the tension between Jamieson and him was unreal . I said something about his mother and he yelled at me . He told me to shut my mouth and to never mention her again . ”
47834	47867	47509	47509	she	138	“ He has his own demons he ’s battling , sweetheart , and walking away from any type of emotion has become normal for him . It ’s probably all he knows . ”
47868	47899	47741	47741	I	0	“ I do n’t care . He ’s rude and insensitive . I do n’t talk about what happened . I never even told Sam . But I told Jamieson . ”
47900	47958	47509	47509	she	138	“ Do n’t you think that it ’s weird you never told Sam what happened to your parents ? I mean , this was the man you were so in love with . When you ’re in love with someone , you want them to know everything about you , especially a big part of your past . ”
47959	47965	47509	47509	she	138	“ What are you saying ? ”
47973	48007	47966	47966	I	0	“ Are you insinuating that I ’m in love with Jamieson ? I only told him because I was in shock and a marriage was the last thing I needed on that day . ”
48008	48011	47509	47509	she	138	“ Okay . ”
48016	48040	48012	48012	She	958	“ Okay ? God , Aunt Cora , I hate when you do that . You ca n’t just say ‘ okay ’ . ”
48041	48056	48057	48057	She	958	“ Darling , you do n’t want to hear what I have to say . ”
48062	48076	48057	48057	She	958	“ Go get yourself ready for dinner . I ’m taking you out . ”
48162	48167	48168	48168	I	0	“ Someone paged me ? ”
48182	48186	48187	48187	she	148	“ I did , ”
48194	48228	48187	48187	she	148	“ Patient was hit by a truck walking across the street . She has massive internal bleeding and a skull fracture . Her heart stopped , but I was able to revive her . ”
48243	48269	48270	48270	I	0	“ Her pupils are n’t responding and there is no corneal reflex . I ’m sorry , Dr. Harper , your patient is brain dead , ”
48279	48287	48288	48288	I	0	“ You need to prepare the family . ”
48345	48352	48330	48330	I	0	“ You needed to see me ? ”
48353	48373	48411	48411	she	63	“ Yes , come in , Dr. Finn , and have a seat . How did your presentation go ? ”
48374	48379	48411	48411	she	63	“ It went good . ”
48380	48386	48411	48411	she	63	“ And Dr. Harper ’s ? ”
48387	48399	48411	48411	she	63	“ She did great . Is this what was so urgent ? ”
48400	48406	48407	48407	Grace	63	“ Renata , you needed — ”
48415	48454	48411	48411	she	63	“ Come in and have a seat . I need to speak with both of you . There ’s a rumor going around this hospital that the two of you got married while you were in Las Vegas . ”
48455	48461	48462	48462	I	0	“ Who would say that ? ”
48466	48539	48540	48540	she	975	“ Apparently , someone in this hospital , and I ’m not naming names , was in Vegas , in the elevator with the two of you . This person overheard you say , ‘ We ’ll call my attorney and see how quickly we can get this marriage annulled . ’ This person also said that the two of you looked panicked . So , you two better come clean now ! ”
48546	48549	48540	48540	she	975	“ Shit . ”
48558	48570	48550	48550	I	0	“ Did you just say ‘ shit , ’ Dr. Finn ? ”
48571	48576	48577	48577	Grace	63	“ It ’s true , ”
48584	48616	48577	48577	Grace	63	“ Dr. Finn and I did get married in Las Vegas , but it was a mistake and we ’re having it annulled as quickly as possible . We were drunk . ”
48617	48624	48625	48625	she	975	“ Drunk ? You were drunk ? ”
48629	48640	48625	48625	she	975	“ So it is n’t just a rumor , then ? ”
48641	48650	48651	48651	Grace	63	“ No , Renata , it ’s not , ”
48654	48658	48659	48659	She	63	“ And you ! ”
48664	48673	48659	48659	She	63	“ What the hell did I tell you ? ”
48674	48678	48679	48679	I	0	“ It happened , ”
48683	48716	48679	48679	I	0	“ We were heavily intoxicated and did n’t know what we were doing . We are getting it taken care of immediately . No one was supposed to ever know . Shit . ”
48717	48748	48659	48659	She	63	“ Shit is right . Now the whole hospital is talking , so expect some backlash , Dr. Finn , from all the heartbroken nurses who wanted more from you . ”
48749	48755	48756	48756	I	0	“ Are we done here ? ”
48763	48773	48756	48756	I	0	“ I have an aneurysm I need to clip . ”
48774	48783	48659	48659	She	63	“ You may go , but Grace stays . ”
48789	48795	48799	48799	she	70	“ How did this happen ? ”
48807	48823	48799	48799	she	70	“ I do n’t know . Neither one of us remembers anything from that night . ”
48824	48848	48799	48799	she	70	“ Why on earth would you drink like that ? That is n’t like you . Did you do this on your birthday ? ”
48849	48955	48799	48799	she	70	“ Yes . Usually on my birthday , I make sure to take a double shift at the hospital . That way , I ’m so busy I do n’t have time to think about it . I figured if I just spent the day drinking , I would n’t have to . Then we met this couple there and spent a majority of the day with them . After dinner is when everything else is a total blank . Jamieson told me that it ’s best we stay out of each other ’s way . He does n’t even want to be friends anymore . ”
48956	48989	48990	48990	She	976	“ Typical Jamieson . Screw them and leave them . Or in this case , marry them and leave them . I ’m not the least bit surprised . Are you okay ? ”
48998	49001	48992	48992	her	976	“ Yeah . ”
49009	49072	49002	49002	I	0	“ I never should have come back here . I left New York to get away from my ex - boyfriend . We dated for over a year until I found out he was married . I did n’t know , Renata , just like I do n’t know how Jamieson and I got married . How can I be so stupid ? ”
49073	49124	49125	49125	My	0	“ You ’re not stupid , Grace . Both of those men are stupid . You ’re a highly intelligent trauma surgeon . You ’re human , just like everyone else . We all make mistakes in life . Some start making them a little later in life than others . ”
49150	49166	49148	49148	Jamieson	51	“ My lawyer just called . We need to be in court tomorrow at noon . ”
49167	49170	49002	49002	I	0	“ Okay . ”
49171	49185	49148	49148	Jamieson	51	“ That was Jamieson . We have a court date tomorrow at noon . ”
49186	49216	49217	49217	She	977	“ That was fast . But I guess when you have the kind of money he does , you can get things done quickly . Too bad , though . ”
49220	49240	49217	49217	She	977	“ I would have liked to have seen him sweat it out for at least a couple of weeks . ”
49248	49272	49241	49241	I	0	“ By the way , my Aunt Cora is in town and she said she will be dropping by to see you later . ”
49273	49276	49277	49277	She	977	“ Really ? ”
49280	49289	49277	49277	She	977	“ It ’ll be good to see her . ”
49329	49334	49335	49335	she	977	“ Is it true ? ”
49338	49354	49335	49335	she	977	“ For the love of God , please tell me it ’s just a rumor . ”
49355	49371	49310	49310	She	977	“ I wish I could , Jackie . Jamieson and I got hitched in Vegas . ”
49372	49379	49310	49310	She	977	“ Grace , what the fuck ? ”
49380	49399	49310	49310	She	977	“ We were drunk . Really , really drunk . Neither one of us remembers exactly what happened . ”
49400	49410	49310	49310	She	977	“ And you know for sure it ’s legit ? ”
49411	49444	49445	49445	She	977	“ Oh , it ’s legit all right . I have the proof of marriage certificate to prove it . We woke up the next morning with gold bands on our fingers . ”
49450	49460	49445	49445	She	977	“ You poor thing . I ’m so sorry . ”
49461	49490	49445	49445	She	977	“ It ’s okay . I wo n’t be Mrs. Jamieson Finn for long . We have a court date to get the marriage annulled tomorrow at noon . ”
49590	49601	49602	49602	he	984	“ I told you my lawyer would handle this quickly , ”
49605	49627	49602	49602	he	984	“ By this time tomorrow , our marriage will be annulled , and it will be as if it never happened . ”
49628	49649	49650	49650	I	0	“ I never doubted you for a second , and as far as I ’m concerned , it never did . ”
49681	49693	49671	49671	I	0	“ Hey , we can drive to the courthouse together tomorrow . ”
49694	49700	49658	49658	Jamieson	149	“ I can drive myself . ”
49701	49720	49756	49756	Grace	63	“ But we ’re going to the same place . It does n’t make sense to drive separate . ”
49721	49733	49734	49734	I	0	“ It makes perfect sense , Dr. Finn . Good night . ”
49757	49773	49774	49774	I	0	“ That was Jamieson . He said we can drive to the courthouse together tomorrow , ”
49781	49784	49774	49774	I	0	“ And ? ”
49794	49803	49789	49789	she	66	“ I told him I can drive myself . ”
49804	49836	49789	49789	she	66	“ Okay . But it does make sense for the two of you to drive together . There ’s parking fees and a lot of traffic . Let him handle it . ”
49837	49858	49789	49789	she	66	“ I ’ll take the parking fees and traffic . It ’s better than sitting in a car with him . ”
49859	49869	49870	49871	Aunt Cora	66	“ And now you ’re in the angry stage , ”
49874	49929	49870	49871	Aunt Cora	66	“ You bet I ’m angry . He ’s a jerk . A man with no emotions whatsoever . Maybe someone needs to cut into his brain to find out what ’s going on in there . And to think I once called him a saint . He ’s more like the damn devil . ”
49938	49947	49948	49948	she	66	“ When did you call him a saint ? ”
49951	50005	49948	49948	she	66	“ The night we met in New York . He got the woman who was sitting next to him a cab and sent her home because she was drunk . He did tell me right then and there that he was far from being a saint . I should have heeded his warning . ”
50011	50022	50023	50023	Jamieson	51	“ There you are . I was looking for you , ”
50033	50036	50037	50037	I	0	“ Why ? ”
50048	50062	50037	50037	I	0	“ The offer still stands . We can drive together to the courthouse . ”
50063	50077	50078	50078	I	0	“ And my answer is still the same . I ’m driving myself . ”
50085	50096	50097	50097	he	112	“ Suit yourself , and you better not be late , ”
50106	50110	50111	50111	she	987	“ You okay ? ”
50114	50144	50145	50145	I	0	“ I ’m great . I ’ve already saved a life today and my drunken marriage is getting annulled . Could n’t have asked for a more perfect day . ”
50148	50157	50145	50145	I	0	“ Is your Aunt Cora still in town ? ”
50158	50178	50179	50179	I	0	“ No . She flew back to New York this morning . She has patients she needs to see . ”
50299	50304	50305	50305	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
50330	50343	50344	50344	I	0	“ I need you to stay very still . Someone call 911 , ”
50359	50385	50347	50347	I	0	“ I ’m a doctor and I ’m going to stay with you until the paramedics get here . Can you tell me your name ? ”
50386	50389	50390	50390	He	992	“ Justin . ”
50393	50401	50402	50402	I	0	“ How old are you , Justin ? ”
50419	50429	50405	50405	I	0	“ Sixteen . I ca n’t feel my legs . ”
50430	50438	50439	50439	I	0	“ You ’re going to be okay . ”
50465	50469	50470	50470	Aiden	153	“ Dr. Harper ? ”
50482	50532	50476	50476	he	153	“ Sixteen - year - old male hit by a vehicle . Muffled breath sounds on the left side , abdominal distention , broken leg , and potential spinal injury . He ca n’t feel his legs . Stabilize his neck and back and start him on oxygen stat . ”
50533	50539	50540	50540	Justin	152	“ I ca n’t breathe , ”
50543	50552	50540	50540	Justin	152	“ Dr. Harper , his pressure is dropping . ”
50562	50587	50553	50553	I	0	“ Damn it , he has fluid rising in his chest . I need to insert a chest tube . Get me the kit . ”
50601	50616	50620	50620	him	992	“ Justin , this is going to hurt , but I have no choice . ”
50632	50664	50665	50665	I	0	“ I have to be in court like five minutes ago . Get him to the ER now . I ’ll make the call and let them know you ’re coming , ”
50670	50709	50665	50665	I	0	“ Justin , the paramedics are going to take you to the hospital and I ’ll make sure a team of doctors are waiting for you . When I get back there , I ’ll check on you . ”
50715	50719	50720	50720	he	153	“ Thank you , ”
50741	50748	50749	50750	an officer	1001	“ Excuse me , Dr. Harper ? ”
50753	50762	50749	50750	an officer	1001	“ I need you to make a statement . ”

55685	55702	55623	55623	Jamieson	51	“ Let ’s order in . There ’s something I need to talk to you about . ”
55703	55706	55670	55670	he	51	“ Okay . ”
55761	55856	55753	55753	he	51	“ I did some research on the electrode implants and I talked to the doctor in Switzerland . They did a trial but have n’t published it yet . Ten patients , ten implants , and all ten failed . The patients were still paralyzed . I ’m sorry , Grace , but Justin ’s L6 was crushed . You saw the X - rays . I think you ’re asking for the impossible here . The implant wo n’t work , and I do n’t want to get that kid ’s hopes up . ”
55857	55915	56199	56199	he	1125	“ Nothing is impossible , Jamieson . Impossible is a word you of all people should n’t be using . You ’re a brilliant neurosurgeon . You remove brain tumors that no other doctor in the world would touch . You ’ve done the impossible . So how can you sit there and say that to me ? ”
55916	55937	55753	55753	he	51	“ Because it ’s a fact ! And I will not give that boy hope when there is n’t any . ”
55938	55972	55753	55753	he	51	“ Figure it out , Jamieson . Take the research they ’ve already done and figure it out . I know for a fact you ’ve done deep brain stimulation for certain diseases . ”
55973	55994	56199	56199	he	1125	“ That ’s different and you know it . Or maybe you do n’t because you ’re not a neurosurgeon . ”
55995	56001	55753	55753	he	51	“ Please , just try . ”
56002	56023	55753	55753	he	51	“ I ca n’t . I do n’t have time anyway . I ’m in the middle of something else . ”
56024	56075	56199	56199	he	1125	“ Oh , that ’s right , your schizophrenia research . You really think you ’re going to find a cure for that ? You have a better chance at helping someone walk . And what ’s your obsession with it anyway ? Do you know someone who is schizophrenic ? ”
56076	56111	56112	56112	he	1125	“ I ’ve seen patients with it and it ’s a horrible way to live . If I can help them return to their normal lives , then I ’m going to do it , ”
56119	56185	56112	56112	he	1125	“ But yet you wo n’t try to help a sixteen - year - old kid who was just crossing the street and was ran down by an erratic driver walk again ? You wo n’t try to help him return to his normal life ? You know what , Jamieson ? All this shit you ’re doing for schizophrenia is nothing but a pipedream . ”
56186	56195	56196	56196	he	1125	“ Get the hell out of my house ! ”
56222	56234	56235	56235	I	0	“ I would if I could , but I ca n’t ! ”
56306	56309	56310	56310	I	0	“ Shit ! ”
56313	56317	56310	56310	I	0	“ Damn it ! ”
56381	56393	56394	56394	he	51	“ I thought maybe you left . What the hell happened ? ”
56410	56417	56397	56397	he	51	“ Nothing . Leave me alone ! ”
56451	56460	56461	56461	He	51	“ Grace Harper , open up this door ! ”
56464	56473	56461	56461	He	51	“ I told you to leave me alone ! ”
56474	56487	56461	56461	He	51	“ Too fucking bad . You ’re hurt . Let me see . ”
56488	56491	56461	56461	He	51	“ No ! ”
56492	56500	56461	56461	He	51	“ Grace , I ’m warning you ! ”
56501	56516	56461	56461	He	51	“ Warn all you want , Jamieson . I ’m not afraid of you ! ”
56532	56545	56546	56546	I	0	“ Oh my God . Will you please just leave me alone ? ”
56549	56555	56556	56556	he	51	“ Let me see it , ”
56564	56582	56583	56583	He	51	“ I can stitch it up myself . So please leave and let me get to it . ”
56595	56627	56583	56583	He	51	“ You have a couple small pieces of glass in there . I need to get them out before I stitch you up . Where did you get that medical bag ? ”
56628	56632	56649	56649	his	51	“ My car . ”
56633	56645	56583	56583	He	51	“ You keep a fully stocked medical bag in your car ? ”
56654	56667	56649	56649	his	51	“ Yes . In case of an emergency . Like this one ! ”
56673	56693	56668	56668	I	0	“ Grace , I ’m sorry . This happened to you because of me . I did n’t mean — ”
56694	56722	56649	56649	his	51	“ Do n’t apologize . I ’m sorry for what I said . I never should have said that . This is my punishment for being mean . ”
56723	56751	56752	56752	He	51	“ It looks like you ’ll need about four or five stitches . Do you want to do a couple shots of tequila before I get started ? ”
56755	56760	56752	56752	He	51	“ You seem nervous . ”
56761	56800	56649	56649	his	51	“ The only thing I ’m nervous about is you not doing it perfectly and leaving me with a scar . I wo n’t leave a scar . So hand over the sutures and let me stitch myself . ”
56801	56821	56752	56752	He	51	“ I ’m not going to leave a scar . I can promise you that . Are you ready ? ”
56822	56834	56835	56835	I	0	“ I ’ll be watching you very carefully , Dr. Finn . ”
56859	56865	56842	56842	He	51	“ There . All done . ”
56866	56873	56874	56874	I	0	“ Thanks . You did good . ”
56883	56889	56874	56874	I	0	“ I still hate you . ”
56890	56900	56901	56901	He	51	“ Yeah , well , I hate you too . ”
56950	56959	56960	56960	I	0	“ I ’m not having sex with you , ”
56972	56975	56976	56976	he	51	“ Grace , ”
56994	57079	56979	56979	I	0	“ You made it very clear that our relationship was to be kept on a professional level and that we would not be having sex again . You stitched me up and we had a moment . We ca n’t go back . Things have changed between us . We resent each other for what happened , and having sex is n’t going to change that . When it ’s all over , nothing will be different . We will still resent each other . ”
57080	57085	57086	57086	he	51	“ You ’re right , ”
57155	57167	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ There you are . I ’ve been looking for you , ”
57171	57186	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ I sent you like a million text messages and you have n’t responded . ”
57187	57202	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ Sorry . I ’ve been really busy . Is there something you need ? ”
57203	57232	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ No . We have n’t hung out in a while . I just want to make sure you ’re okay . How is it living with Grace ? ”
57233	57281	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ Total hell . That ’s how it is . We have n’t spoken a word to each other in two weeks at home , and she ’s a total cock blocker . Not one nurse in this hospital will have sex with me because of her . ”
57282	57289	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ Have you actually asked them ? ”
57290	57299	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ No . But I hear them whispering . ”
57300	57313	57314	57314	he	1134	“ Then go out and find some chick to have sex with , ”
57317	57324	57314	57314	he	1134	“ It ’s not that simple . ”
57325	57332	57333	57333	He	1134	“ What are you talking about ? ”
57336	57356	57333	57333	He	1134	“ Sure it is . Wait a minute . Would you feel guilty or something because you ’re married ? ”
57363	57390	57357	57357	I	0	“ Jamieson , come on . You and Grace are only married by signatures on a piece of paper . It ’s not a real marriage . ”
57391	57396	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ I know that . ”
57397	57449	57314	57314	he	1134	“ I do n’t get it , bro . If the two of you are living in the same house , why are n’t you sleeping together ? I mean , I know you ’re pissed about this whole situation , but it ’s just sex . She has needs too . ”
57450	57483	57357	57357	I	0	“ She wo n’t because I made it very clear after I found out we were married that our relationship is going to be strictly professional and there will be no sex . ”
57484	57496	57168	57168	Logan	95	“ Well , did you try to have sex with her ? ”
57497	57537	57314	57314	he	1134	“ Yeah . I kissed her that night I stitched up her arm . I really thought it was going to happen . I wanted it to happen , but she stopped it and reminded me of my words . ”
57538	57559	57357	57357	I	0	“ Ah , so she ’s punishing you . You do realize that ’s what she ’s doing , right ? ”
57560	57569	57570	57570	He	1135	“ I guess . Who the fuck knows . ”
57578	57616	57617	57617	He	1135	“ You ’re going to get through this , buddy . To be honest , it does n’t have to be this hard . It only is because the two of you are making it that way . ”
57711	57716	57717	57717	I	0	“ You got this . ”
57741	57749	57750	57750	I	0	“ Time of death , thirteen fifteen , ”
57806	57814	57799	57799	Jamieson	51	“ Hey , how ’s your patient ? ”
57815	57818	57819	57819	I	0	“ Dead , ”
57822	57841	57842	57842	he	51	“ I ’m sorry . Do you have a few minutes so we can sit down and talk ? ”
57845	57857	57842	57842	he	51	“ This seems like the only place we can do that . ”
57858	57865	57866	57866	I	0	“ Talk about what , Jamieson ? ”
57869	57888	57866	57866	I	0	“ I think I might have found a way to help Justin walk again with the electrode implants . ”
57889	57895	57842	57842	he	51	“ Are you kidding me ? ”
57896	57905	57842	57842	he	51	“ No . Can we please sit down ? ”
57906	57912	57866	57866	I	0	“ Yes , of course . ”
57930	57997	57923	57923	Jamieson	51	“ Now , I ’m going to need you to insert the electrode into the spine while I insert one in his brain . We have to do it at the exact same time . If we ’re even off by a second , it ’s not going to work . We need to put our personal differences aside and work as a team on this . ”
57998	58005	58006	58006	I	0	“ Of course . Thank you . ”
58018	58032	58009	58009	I	0	“ Thank you , Jamieson . I knew you would figure it out . ”
58033	58062	57923	57923	Jamieson	51	“ Do n’t thank me yet , Grace . There is still a chance it wo n’t work , and we need to prepare Justin for that possibility . ”
58063	58067	58068	58068	I	0	“ I know , ”
58076	58089	58068	58068	I	0	“ I ’m needed in the ER . We ’ll talk later ? ”
58090	58093	58094	58094	He	51	“ Sure . ”
58124	58132	58133	58133	I	0	“ Justine , what ’s going on ? ”
58142	58155	58133	58133	I	0	“ Dr. Harper , I have n’t been feeling so good lately . ”
58180	58187	58188	58188	I	0	“ What symptoms are you experiencing ? ”
58191	58200	58188	58188	I	0	“ I ’ve been having severe headaches and — ”
58213	58218	58219	58219	I	0	“ She ’s seizing , ”
58230	58242	58243	58243	I	0	“ Push five milligrams of diazepam and page Dr. Finn stat ! ”
58255	58267	58268	58268	Sara	54	“ Dr. Harper , she ’s going into V - fib , ”
58271	58288	58268	58268	Sara	54	“ Damn it . If we shock her during the seizure , it could kill her . ”
58289	58297	58301	58301	he	51	“ How long has she been seizing ? ”
58307	58312	58313	58313	I	0	“ Over five minutes , ”
58316	58324	58313	58313	I	0	“ How much diazepam did you give ? ”
58325	58329	58339	58339	he	51	“ Five milligrams . ”
58330	58335	58336	58336	he	51	“ Push another five , ”
58368	58385	58386	58386	he	51	“ Is n’t this the patient who was beaten by her boyfriend a couple months ago ? ”
58389	58405	58386	58386	he	51	“ Yes . Before she started seizing , she said she was having severe headaches . ”
58421	58429	58430	58430	I	0	“ What is going on out there ? ”
58438	58464	58433	58433	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I ’ll go check , but we need to get her to CT . Wait here for a minute . ”
58465	58473	58474	58474	Justine	158	“ What ’s going on out there ? ”
58477	58488	58474	58474	Justine	158	“ I ’m not sure . But do n’t worry . ”
58497	58510	58489	58489	I	0	“ We ’re going to take you up for a CT scan . ”
58536	58540	58541	58541	I	0	“ Come on , ”
58546	58553	58541	58541	I	0	“ Let ’s take her up . ”
58575	58585	58586	58586	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? Who is yelling ? ”
58653	58656	58657	58657	His	2447	“ You ! ”
58663	58687	58657	58657	His	2447	“ You were there that night . I remember you . You were the one who told me that my mom was dead . ”
58799	58821	58822	58822	I	0	“ You ’re right , and I ’m sorry , Mr. Samson . We did everything we could to save her , ”
58826	58831	58832	58832	he	2550	“ You did n’t ! ”
58842	58861	58835	58835	he	2550	“ You could have done more ! She was all I had and now someone has to pay . ”
58890	58901	58902	58902	I	0	“ Go ahead then , shoot me . Why not ? ”
58910	58939	58902	58902	I	0	“ Maybe this is the reason I came back here to Los Angeles , to this very hospital . Maybe now it ’s my turn to die here . ”
58940	58943	58944	58944	Jamieson	51	“ Grace ! ”
58947	58956	58957	58958	the man	2550	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
58961	59106	59107	59107	I	0	“ Twenty years ago , I was in a car accident with my parents and we were brought to this hospital . I stood outside each of their rooms as the doctors called time of death for each one of them . I was ten years old and they were all I had too . Maybe this is how my life is supposed to end , here in this hospital , just like I wished it had twenty years ago . Hell , I ’ve made some piss poor choices since then anyway . I dated a man for over a year that I did n’t know was married . I quit my job in New York , moved here , took a job at the place where I watched my parents die , and I married a man in Vegas I barely know . ”
59110	59135	59107	59107	I	0	“ You ’re not the crazy one here , Mr. Samson . I am . So just do me the favor and end it . ”
59136	59149	59150	59150	he	1170	“ You ’re a doctor . You ’re supposed to save lives , ”
59153	59161	59150	59150	he	1170	“ You were supposed to save her . ”
59162	59258	59107	59107	I	0	“ I do save lives and I also lose lives . Sometimes , the injuries are so bad , they ca n’t be fixed , no matter how hard we try . Like with your mom and my parents . Mr. Samson , you do n’t want to do this . You do n’t want to hurt anyone , and your mother certainly would n’t want you to . You feel guilty because you were the one driving the car . It ’s easier to blame someone else to lessen our own pain and guilt . ”
59259	59269	59270	59270	he	1171	“ You ’re either really brave or really stupid , ”
59273	59303	59270	59270	he	1171	“ But you ’re right , it was my fault she died . She kept telling me to stop texting and I told her not to worry about it . ”
59344	59356	59357	59357	I	0	“ Sara , get Justine to CT for a head scan , ”
59464	59481	59445	59445	He	51	“ Why , Grace ? Why did you do that ? He could have killed you . ”
59482	59491	59445	59445	He	51	“ He did n’t want to hurt anyone . ”
59492	59499	59454	59454	his	51	“ You do n’t know that . ”
59500	59506	59507	59507	I	0	“ I do know that . ”
59521	59539	59540	59540	I	0	“ We need to go figure out what ’s going on with Justine . Are you coming ? ”
59548	59557	59540	59540	I	0	“ Grace , I do n’t think you — ”
59558	59563	59564	59564	I	0	“ Are you coming ? ”
59602	59610	59611	59611	he	51	“ She has a serious brain bleed , ”
59614	59625	59626	59626	I	0	“ And that ’s what caused the grand mal seizure ? ”
59629	59636	59637	59637	He	51	“ Yeah . It ’s bad . ”
59650	59675	59637	59637	He	51	“ This is Dr. Finn . I need an OR prepped now . I ’m bringing up a patient with a serious brain bleed . ”
59676	59689	59637	59637	He	51	“ Let ’s get her out of there and get her prepped . ”
59690	59704	59705	59705	I	0	“ Could it have been going on for the past couple of months ? ”
59708	59719	59705	59705	I	0	“ It ’s very likely it started off extremely slow . ”
59720	59732	59733	59733	I	0	“ But her last scans did n’t show a brain bleed , ”
59736	59771	59733	59733	I	0	“ Sometimes if the bleed is small enough , it wo n’t show up , which I believe happened here . There ’s no way we could have known this was going to happen . ”
59772	59779	59705	59705	I	0	“ I want to scrub in . ”
59780	59801	59705	59705	I	0	“ No . What I need is for you to go home . You need to go home , Grace . ”
59802	59812	59813	59813	I	0	“ What I need is to be in surgery , ”
59836	59847	59820	59820	He	1177	“ Fine . You can scrub in on one condition . ”
59848	59854	59855	59855	I	0	“ And what ’s that ? ”
59860	59881	59855	59855	I	0	“ After Justine ’s surgery , I ’m driving you home . I do n’t want you driving . Deal ? ”
59882	59885	59886	59886	I	0	“ Fine . ”
59915	59937	59906	59909	one of my residents	2510	“ Excuse me , Dr. Harper . Dr. Sinclair wants to see you the minute you ’re done with your surgery . ”
59938	59952	59987	59987	Jamieson	51	“ Tell her that I ’ll talk to her first thing tomorrow morning . ”
59953	59982	59983	59983	I	0	“ She told me that you ’d probably say that , and she said you are to be in her office the second you get out of surgery . ”
59993	60011	59987	59987	Jamieson	51	“ Do n’t mess with Mama Bear . I ’m almost finished . You can go now . ”
60012	60021	59987	59987	Jamieson	51	“ No . I can help you finish . ”
60022	60055	60056	60056	I	0	“ Dr. Harper , I ’m going to put this as nicely as I can . Get out of my OR . Go talk to Renata and then we ’ll go home . ”
60066	60073	60056	60056	I	0	“ You wanted to see me ? ”

We spent a few hours there , walking around , riding the rides and eating all kinds of junk food . The minute we got in the car , it started to pour rain . My mom told my dad to wait until it let up , but he said , ‘ We ’ll be fine . We need to get our birthday princess home . She had a long day . ’ We were driving down a two - way road . I remember sitting in the back seat watching the windshield wipers go back and forth as fast as they could trying to clear the rain from the window . My mom was telling my dad to pull over because he was having trouble seeing the road and she was scared . So he did . I told my parents that I wanted to go home , and my dad turned around , smiled , and said as soon as God was finished watering the land , we would . My mom reached over to take off her seatbelt because she needed to get something from her purse that was on the floor . It was hard enough for her to bend over as it was because she was eight months pregnant . My father told her to stay buckled and that he would get it for her , so he took off his seatbelt , and when he reached down to get her purse , there was a crash from behind . A force so hard that it flipped our car . “
61529	61545	61516	61516	She	1117	“ ‘ Grace , where ’s Daddy ? ’ she asked in a panicked tone . “

67846	67977	67771	67771	She	1160	“ You know what ? Maybe you ’re right . His problems are n’t mine . I told him everything about me . My parents ’ death , Sam , everything . I never talked about what happened that night of the car accident to anyone . Not even Sam . But I told Jamieson , and for one night , he was so amazingly sweet . There is another side to him . A side he does n’t let anyone see . Ever since his mother was admitted , he ’s become so angry . I thought maybe things with him were starting to turn around after that night . But since his mother arrived and I treated her , it ’s like he hates me even more now . ”
67978	67996	67776	67776	her	1160	“ I do n’t think he hates you , Grace . I think he ’s probably embarrassed . ”
67997	68020	67771	67771	She	1160	“ Maybe , but it does n’t give him the right to act like an asshole . I ’m so over it . ”

68656	68727	68644	68644	I	0	“ Did you ever stop to think that you ’re the reason women around you are bat shit crazy ? Oh wait , that ’s right . You ’re a man and you ’re never ever wrong . You ’re perfect . You live in your perfect little beach house , work your perfect little job , and treat perfectly good women with no respect in your perfect little way . ”

71688	72048	71685	71685	Grace	63	“ Anything and everything . Aliens , the government , but mainly my father . She was convinced they were trying to kill her and me . We stayed there for days until my father found us . I was n’t allowed to go outside because of her paranoia . The last time she had taken me away was when it got really bad . She would lie in her bed and scream all night long . She told me that the aliens took her in the middle of the night and injected worms inside her . She would scratch her arms so violently that she broke the skin in several places . I could n’t take it anymore , so when she was asleep , I found her keys that she had hidden , unlocked the door , and ran for help . After about two miles , I stumbled across a small family - owned general store . They called the police and an ambulance , and she was taken to the hospital . But even before all that , she was behaving strangely . I would sit at the top of the steps and listen my father scream at her . He told her she was an unfit mother and that he was going to take me away from her . I ’m positive that was part of the reason she took me and ran . After she was hospitalized and finally diagnosed , she started her medication and came home . My father could n’t understand , and he did n’t want to deal with it or her . He started working late nights at the hospital , and not too long after everything had happened , he filed for divorce and sought full custody of me , stating she was incapable of taking care of me full time . The judge agreed , and he got full custody and she had visitation . That destroyed her . After the divorce was final , that son of a bitch opened up his Beverly Hills practice . He purposely waited so she could n’t touch it . ”
72049	72057	72058	72058	Grace	63	“ Jamieson , I ’m so sorry , ”
72069	72428	72061	72061	she	63	“ He told me that he opened that practice for me , because I was going to become a great urologist like him , and after I finished med school and my residency , we ’d run it together . He told me that it was my legacy because his father , my grandfather , was also a urologist and his father before him . I did n’t want to be a urologist . I was n’t sure at that point what field of medicine I wanted to study until I began researching schizophrenia and the brain . I became fascinated with neuroanatomy and the complexities of it . I was drawn to the different types of tumors and the tremendous amount of sacrifice and challenges that I would be faced with . I could n’t do anything at that point to save my mom , because there is no cure for schizophrenia , but I could save other people . I could restore the normalcy of their lives that the tumors took away from them . I could give them back to their loved ones . When I explained all this to my father , he resented me for it and told me that I was going to become a urologist . He screamed and yelled all the time and said I was nothing but a disappointment . He told me it was in my blood and that I ’d never be good at anything else , even though I was at a genius level . So , to keep the peace , I led him to believe all through med school that I was going to be what he wanted me to be . It was n’t until my residency that I finally told him to fuck off and that I was going to be a neurosurgeon . I told him that I was going to find a cure for schizophrenia and that I was going to help my mom . He called me every name in the book and told me that I was living a pipedream and one day I ’d regret my decision . ”
72429	72440	72441	72441	Grace	63	“ Oh my God . He ’s such an asshole , ”
72444	72453	72441	72441	Grace	63	“ What parent does that to their child ? ”
72454	72656	72061	72061	she	63	“ Exactly . He could n’t even be bothered to come to my graduation or to any of the award ceremonies that I was acknowledged at . He completely cut me off during my residency . The only reason I have the money I do , besides making great money at my job , is because my grandfather left me a trust fund in my name that I was to receive in full when I turned twenty - five . It was a secret trust fund that he kept from my father because he knew how he was . He passed away when I was nineteen , but I told him in confidence a few months before he passed that I was going to be the best neurosurgeon in the world and no one was going to stop me . So you ’re right when you say there is no love lost between me and my father . He ca n’t stand me as much as I ca n’t stand him . He never forgave me for going into neurosurgery and I never forgave him for being a lousy father and for walking away from my mother when she needed him . ”
72657	72664	72665	72665	Grace	63	“ Where did your mom go ? ”
72668	72742	72665	72665	Grace	63	“ Hell if I know . This is what she does . She disappears and then pops back in every few years . This last time she was gone for five years and she ’ll probably be gone for another five . I stopped needing her a long time ago . I did n’t need anyone . I knew what I wanted and what my focus was , my career and my research . ”
72749	72791	72743	72743	I	0	“ I ’m sorry for the way I treated you and for the things I said . A part of me felt like my father and I hated it . I ’m not him , Grace . I never will be . ”

72917	72953	72914	72914	She	63	“ I know and maybe we could just forget about that for the time being . I want to get to know you without all the drama and baggage we both have in our lives . ”

75851	75873	75838	75838	I	0	“ Except for a few scrapes and bruises , she ’s fine . She ’ll be up in a few minutes . ”
75874	75881	75882	75882	he	93	“ I ca n’t be here , ”
75886	75943	75882	75882	he	93	“ Why ? Because of Grace ? You ’re lucky she did n’t let you die . Yes , my friend , I know all about you and what you did to her . I must say , you ’ve got some huge balls for being able to pull that off as long as you did . ”
75944	75951	75838	75838	I	0	“ Who the hell are you ? ”
75952	75988	75838	75838	I	0	“ Oh , excuse me . My bad . I ’m Dr. Finn . The one who drilled the burr hole in your head to drain the pressure from the fluid that was building up . ”
75989	75996	75882	75882	he	93	“ Why would she tell you ? ”
75997	76011	76012	76012	I	0	“ I ’m not sure you really want me to answer that question . ”
76015	76058	76012	76012	I	0	“ Anyway , I ’ll let your wife know you ’re awake and send her up . She ’s a beautiful woman and seems to love you a lot . I ’m still trying to figure out what she sees in you . ”
76066	76069	76059	76059	I	0	“ Jamieson . ”
76083	76091	76070	76070	Logan	95	“ Drinks tonight . I ’m buying . ”
76092	76109	76059	76059	I	0	“ I ca n’t , man . I told Grace I ’d be home for dinner . ”
76110	76113	76114	76114	He	95	“ What ? ”
76117	76123	76114	76114	He	95	“ You ’re kidding me . ”
76124	76131	76132	76132	I	0	“ No . I ’m not , ”
76142	76150	76132	76132	I	0	“ I told her everything last night . ”
76151	76162	76114	76114	He	95	“ Damn , man . You ’ve fallen for her . ”
76163	76182	76114	76114	He	95	“ I care about her and I figured it was time to share that part of my life . ”
76183	76213	76132	76132	I	0	“ Does this mean the two of you are going to get married ? Oh wait , you already are . Is there no annulment in your future now ? ”
76214	76249	76114	76114	He	95	“ There will be an annulment . I do n’t want to be married . Like I said , I care about Grace , but I do n’t want to be married to her . ”
76250	76256	76257	76257	He	1522	“ Good luck with that . ”
76264	76272	76257	76257	He	1522	“ Anyway , I got this today . ”
76285	76291	76276	76276	he	1522	“ It ’s a girl . ”
76292	76295	76296	76296	I	0	“ Congratulations . ”
76303	76311	76296	76296	I	0	“ Are things going okay with Riley ? ”
76312	76334	76276	76276	he	1522	“ Yeah . Things are great . She ’s an amazing woman . Maybe the four of us can go out . ”
76335	76339	76340	76340	I	0	“ Great idea , ”
76425	76428	76429	76429	he	51	“ Hey , ”
76432	76449	76429	76429	he	51	“ I got tied up in surgery with a spinal cord injury . Did you eat ? ”
76450	76469	76470	76470	I	0	“ Considering it ’s ten o’clock , yeah , I did . There ’s leftovers in the refrigerator , ”
76480	76484	76470	76470	I	0	“ You cooked ? ”
76485	76492	76429	76429	he	51	“ I did . Good night . ”
76493	76505	76470	76470	I	0	“ Grace , wait . What do you mean good night ? ”
76506	76522	76523	76523	I	0	“ I ’m tired , so I ’m going to bed . Enjoy your dinner . ”
76601	76605	76606	76606	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
76611	76631	76632	76632	he	51	“ Please , it ’s not like I have n’t seen you naked before . What is your problem ? ”
76641	76644	76632	76632	he	51	“ Nothing . ”
76645	76654	76635	76635	he	51	“ Bullshit , Grace . Talk to me . ”
76655	76686	76687	76687	I	0	“ Fine . You want to know what my problem is ? You could have at least called or texted me to let me know you would n’t be home , ”
76701	76722	76687	76687	I	0	“ I cooked dinner for you . I never cooked for you before and I thought it would be nice . ”
76723	76742	76771	76771	He	1528	“ I ’m sorry . I had an emergency surgery . You of all people should understand that . ”
76743	76770	76771	76771	He	1528	“ I do understand that , but you could have at least called or even had one of your residents tell me if you could n’t . ”
76794	76805	76785	76785	he	1528	“ Patients come first , Grace , even before you . ”
76806	76817	76818	76818	I	0	“ You just do n’t get it , do you ? ”
76823	76841	76818	76818	I	0	“ Maybe this thing we ’re trying , whatever it is , is n’t going to work . ”
76842	76855	76856	76856	He	1528	“ You ’re right , maybe it is n’t . Good night . ”
76861	76864	76865	76865	I	0	“ Asshole ! ”
77103	77114	77090	77090	his	51	“ I know I upset you and I ’m sorry . ”
77115	77137	77138	77138	I	0	“ And I realize it really was n’t your fault . You do n’t answer to anyone . You never have , ”
77141	77186	77138	77138	I	0	“ This is new to me , Grace . It ’s going to take some practice , and along the way , I will make mistakes . I ’m going to need you to forgive those mistakes and just know that I ’m trying . ”
77187	77199	77221	77221	his	1537	“ I know . I ’m sorry for what I said . ”
77200	77216	77217	77217	I	0	“ Me too . Next time , I will let you know . I promise . ”
77364	77367	77368	77368	He	1537	“ Shower ? ”
77378	77381	77371	77371	he	1537	“ Definitely . ”
77414	77418	77419	77419	I	0	“ Good morning . ”
77427	77435	77419	77419	I	0	“ Have you been here all night ? ”
77436	77445	77399	77399	Sam	93	“ Yeah . I could n’t leave him . ”
77446	77481	77482	77482	She	218	“ Well , I ’m just here to check his vitals and his surgical incisions . Why do n’t you go get yourself a cup of coffee from the cafeteria and maybe some breakfast ? ”
77488	77501	77502	77502	She	218	“ Go ahead , sweetheart . Let the doctor do her job . ”
77530	77549	77525	77525	I	0	“ Grace , I ca n’t believe you ’re here . So this is where you moved to . ”
77550	77553	77554	77554	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
77566	77599	77557	77557	I	0	“ Your wife is very nice and you ’re nothing but a shithead . She does n’t deserve you . She deserves to know what a lying , cheating bastard you are . ”
77600	77608	77609	77609	he	93	“ Are you going to tell her ? ”
77616	77699	77609	77609	he	93	“ No . It ’s not my place to tell her . You ’re the one who lied for over a year . If you feel the need to seek out other women , you have no business being married . Your lack of respect for women repulses me . You got lucky that I ’m a nice person and wo n’t tell her . But when the next woman you lie to comes along , your luck might just run out . ”
77700	77725	77792	77792	he	51	“ Dr. Finn was in here yesterday and he told me that you told him about me . Then he said something really strange . ”
77726	77732	77733	77733	I	0	“ What did he say ? ”
77736	77765	77733	77733	I	0	“ I asked him why you would tell him about me and he said I did n’t want to know the answer . What was he talking about ? ”
77766	77773	77792	77792	he	51	“ Dr. Finn is my husband . ”
77774	77777	77778	77778	He	1542	“ What ? ”
77782	77788	77778	77778	He	1542	“ Good morning , Sam . ”
77805	77817	77818	77818	He	51	“ I trust my beautiful wife is taking care of you ? ”
77823	77838	77818	77818	He	51	“ I ca n’t believe you got married . You barely know this guy . ”
77839	77847	77848	77848	Jamieson	51	“ Trust me . She knows me , ”
77851	77923	77848	77848	Jamieson	51	“ We met in New York . In fact , we met while me and you were still together . He ’s the reason I moved here . I did n’t know how to tell you because I did n’t want to hurt you . So me finding out about your wife was my ticket out . Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I have other patients to see . ”
77924	77929	77930	77930	Sam	93	“ Grace , wait ! ”
77955	77962	77963	77963	He	51	“ Well played , Dr. Harper . ”
77966	77978	77963	77963	He	51	“ I ca n’t believe I lied to him like that . ”
77979	78002	77951	77951	Jamieson	51	“ Do n’t give it another thought . After what he did to you , he deserved it . Feel better now ? ”
78003	78009	78010	78010	I	0	“ Actually , I do . ”
78013	78023	78024	78024	He	51	“ Good . Now put that douchebag behind you . ”
78029	78036	78024	78024	He	51	“ I ’ll see you later . ”
78045	78053	78054	78054	Jamieson	51	“ Are you ready , Dr. Harper ? ”
78062	78070	78057	78057	he	51	“ I ’m ready , Dr. Finn . ”
78071	78125	78057	78057	he	51	“ Remember , we have to place the electrodes at the same exact time . If we ’re even a split second off , it ’s not going to work , and we only get one shot at this . I ’m going to count to three . One . Two . Three . ”
78147	78156	78157	78157	Jamieson	51	“ Okay , let ’s close him up , ”
78174	78242	78162	78162	I	0	“ The surgery went well , but we wo n’t know the outcome until Justin wakes up . If the surgery worked , he will need to learn to walk all over again , just like he did when he was a baby . It ’s going to take time and effort , but I ’m pretty confident your son will have full function in his legs . ”
78243	78255	78256	78256	Justin	152	“ We do n’t know what to say , Dr. Finn . ”
78263	78267	78268	78268	She	1550	“ Thank you . ”
78274	78287	78288	78288	Jamieson	51	“ I thank God every single day you were at that intersection . ”
78296	78318	78319	78319	he	51	“ Good job in there . Have you ever thought of maybe expanding your career and doing a fellowship in neurosurgery ? ”
78322	78325	78319	78319	he	51	“ What ? ”
78329	78341	78342	78342	He	51	“ You can work under me and I ’ll teach you . ”
78345	78359	78342	78342	He	51	“ Would n’t you be worried that I would be better than you ? ”
78370	78381	78382	78382	He	51	“ Good point , but the offer is always open . ”
78390	78396	78382	78382	He	51	“ You two are nauseating . ”
78400	78408	78397	78397	Jackie	112	“ We are , are n’t we ? ”
78443	78452	78453	78453	Jamieson	51	“ Tell me if you can feel this , ”
78461	78471	78453	78453	Jamieson	51	“ Ouch . Yes , I can feel that . ”
78475	78479	78480	78480	Jamieson	51	“ And this ? ”
78485	78496	78480	78480	Jamieson	51	“ Ouch . Yes ! Dr. Finn , does that — ”
78497	78516	78517	78517	Justin	152	“ Yes . Yes it does , Justin . You will have full use of your legs again . ”
78588	78599	78600	78600	she	179	“ How is everything going with you and Dr. Hottie ? ”
78603	78613	78600	78600	she	179	“ Things are amazing . I ’m really happy . ”
78614	78622	78623	78623	She	179	“ I think someone is in love . ”
78626	78633	78623	78623	She	179	“ Have you said it yet ? ”
78634	78664	78600	78600	she	179	“ No . He has n’t either and I do n’t want to be the first one . I ’m a firm believer the man should say it first . ”
78665	78669	78670	78670	she	179	“ I agree , ”
78673	78702	78670	78670	she	179	“ But what if he does n’t ? From what you ’ve told me , I do n’t think he ’s ever told anyone he loved them before . ”
78703	78731	78600	78600	she	179	“ I thought about that . He ’s changed so much since we first met , and I know he ’ll tell me when he ’s ready . ”
78732	78739	78740	78740	She	179	“ You ’re gorgeous , Grace . ”
78751	78756	78743	78743	she	179	“ She sure is , ”
78766	78771	78760	78760	he	51	“ You look beautiful . ”
78772	78778	78600	78600	she	179	“ Thank you , Jamieson . ”
78779	78812	78760	78760	he	51	“ Are the two of you done in here ? I need to jump in the shower . If not , I can use one of the other ones in the house . ”
78813	78821	78822	78822	Larissa	179	“ We ’re done , Dr. Finn , ”
78890	78898	78899	78899	he	51	“ Let me get that for you , ”
78908	78918	78899	78899	he	51	“ Or maybe , let me take it off . ”
78929	78954	78919	78919	His	51	“ You will have to wait to get me out of this dress , Dr. Finn . We ’re already going to be late . ”
78955	78958	78959	78959	He	51	“ Fine . ”
79046	79052	79056	79056	she	70	“ There you two are , ”
79063	79070	79056	79056	she	70	“ Grace , you look gorgeous . ”
79071	79087	79056	79056	she	70	“ Thanks , Renata . So do you . I love that color on you . ”
79088	79101	79102	79102	Jamieson	51	“ Are n’t you going to tell me I look gorgeous too ? ”
79106	79118	79119	79119	She	70	“ No , dear . You already know you look gorgeous . ”
79164	79168	79169	79169	I	0	“ Mrs. Finn . ”
79178	79188	79172	79172	I	0	“ I do n’t know if you remember me . ”
79189	79201	79176	79176	her	70	“ Of course I do . Dr. Grace Harper , right ? ”
79202	79205	79172	79172	I	0	“ Yes . ”
79206	79219	79172	79172	I	0	“ How lovely to see you again . How have you been ? ”
79220	79231	79176	79176	her	70	“ I ’ve been great . How was your cruise ? ”
79232	79268	79172	79172	I	0	“ Magnificent . Any time I get to spend with Carlyle is precious . You know how hectic doctors ’ schedules are . I was hoping that Jamieson is here . Have you seen him ? ”
79269	79282	79172	79172	I	0	“ Yes . We drove together . He ’s around here somewhere . ”
79283	79292	79293	79293	She	1565	“ So are the two of you dating ? ”
79297	79307	79293	79293	She	1565	“ As a matter of fact , we are . ”
79308	79321	79172	79172	I	0	“ As in long - term dating or just a casual fling ? ”
79331	79338	79339	79339	I	0	“ I ’m not really sure . ”
79342	79351	79339	79339	I	0	“ I ’m hoping for long - term . ”
79352	79392	79172	79172	I	0	“ Wow . I ’m so happy to hear that . You know , he does n’t come around much . I ’ve invited him to several events and even dinner at our home , but he never shows . ”
79393	79406	79445	79445	her	1566	“ Well , I know him and Carlyle do n’t get along . ”
79407	79414	79339	79339	I	0	“ So Jamieson told you everything ? ”
79415	79419	79420	79420	I	0	“ He did . ”
79425	79441	79420	79420	I	0	“ I can honestly say that I ’m shocked . He must really love you . ”
79462	79472	79453	79453	she	1566	“ All I want is to see him happy . ”
79473	79477	79339	79339	I	0	“ Me too . ”
79478	79496	79453	79453	she	1566	“ If you ’ll excuse me , I need to go find him and talk to him . ”
79497	79511	79453	79453	she	1566	“ Sure . Of course . It was nice to see you again . ”
79512	79537	79339	79339	I	0	“ You too , Grace . I would love to have the two of you over . Maybe you can talk Jamieson into coming . ”
79538	79543	79544	79544	I	0	“ I can try . ”
79578	79594	79572	79574	Jamieson ’s father	1568	“ Dr. Harper , it ’s nice to see you again . You look stunning . ”
79595	79607	79547	79548	A waiter	1567	“ Thank you , Dr. Finn . Please call me Grace . ”
79608	79636	79572	79574	Jamieson ’s father	1568	“ And you shall call me Carlyle . I saw your presentation at the medical conference . Very impressive . How are things going for you here ? ”
79637	79668	79572	79574	Jamieson ’s father	1568	“ Things are great . Jamieson just made a breakthrough in medicine . The two of us helped a sixteen - year - old boy who was paralyzed walk again . ”
79669	79690	79691	79691	he	1569	“ Is n’t that nice . But I have a question for you . Are you involved with my son ? ”
79694	79707	79691	79691	he	1569	“ Yes . I am . The two of us are dating . ”
79723	79754	79714	79714	I	0	“ I hope you know what you ’ve gotten yourself into . You ’re a beautiful and intelligent woman . You ’ll figure it out soon enough and leave him . ”
79762	79805	79758	79758	I	0	“ Actually , Carlyle , I ’m in love with your son and I know exactly who he is . He is kind , generous , loving , and a brilliant surgeon . He is everything I ever wanted in a man . ”
79806	79836	79837	79837	I	0	“ I have no idea who you are describing , but that sure is n’t my son . My son is a narcissistic , arrogant , and disrespectful man . ”
79879	79899	79871	79872	this man	1851	“ Maybe if you were n’t such a terrible father , he would n’t be that way to you . ”
79900	79916	79917	79917	His	1851	“ Excuse me , young lady ? Who the hell do you think you are ? ”
79925	79935	79936	79936	I	0	“ I ’m the woman who loves your son , ”
79940	79959	79960	79960	He	1851	“ I do n’t know what he ’s told you , but he ’s crazy like his mother . ”
79976	79980	79981	79981	he	1851	“ Goddamn it ! ”

79994	80000	80001	80001	Jamieson	51	“ What is going on ? ”
80008	80018	80004	80004	he	51	“ Your girlfriend here made me drop my drink ! ”
80019	80028	80029	80029	Tracy	135	“ Carlyle , it ’s okay , honey , ”
80032	80049	80029	80029	Tracy	135	“ We ’ll get someone to clean it up and I ’ll get you another one . ”
80050	80069	80004	80004	he	51	“ You need to keep your girl in line , son . She is disrespectful to her peers . ”
80070	80085	80086	80086	Jamieson	51	“ And I ’m sure you said something to her that warranted that disrespect , ”
80111	80125	80098	80098	I	0	“ Do n’t . Father or not , he ’s not worth it . ”
80142	80160	80161	80161	I	0	“ About that dinner invitation , I do n’t think we ’ll be able to make it , ”
80183	80193	80194	80194	I	0	“ What the hell did he say to you ? ”
80198	80214	80194	80194	I	0	“ It does n’t matter . What did Tracy want to talk to you about ? ”
80215	80231	80182	80182	Jamieson	51	“ It does matter , Grace . I want to know what the hell happened . ”
80232	80246	80194	80194	I	0	“ I promise to tell you later and then you can tell me . ”
80247	80250	80251	80251	I	0	“ Grace , ”
80256	80270	80251	80251	I	0	“ We ’ll talk later , Jamieson . Now let ’s go mingle . ”
80310	80328	80298	80298	her	63	“ Talk to me . What happened between you and my father ? What did he say ? ”
80345	80395	80332	80332	she	63	“ Your father is a very angry man . He was insulting you , and I was n’t going to stand around and let him . So I told him that maybe if he was n’t such a terrible father , you would n’t act that way towards him . ”
80396	80407	80332	80332	she	63	“ Jesus , Grace . You said that to him ? ”
80408	80466	80467	80467	I	0	“ Yes . And I do n’t apologize for it either . He is everything you told me he was . I like to give people the benefit of the doubt because there ’s two sides to every story . But him , he proved it right off the bat . Your father is a complete asshole . ”
80474	80491	80467	80467	I	0	“ I told you he was . Tracy said she thinks something is wrong with him . ”
80492	80496	80332	80332	she	63	“ Like what ? ”
80497	80539	80332	80332	she	63	“ She said he ’s been having trouble swallowing and choking a lot on his food . He ’s been having frequent headaches , mood swings , and his blood pressure is high , so he prescribed himself blood pressure medication . ”
80540	80554	80332	80332	she	63	“ I noticed a couple things myself while he was verbally assaulting me . ”
80555	80559	80332	80332	she	63	“ What things ? ”
80560	80595	80332	80332	she	63	“ His uncoordinated eye movement for one and the fact that when he went to pick up a glass of champagne from the tray , he dropped it . Maybe there is something wrong . ”
80596	80667	80668	80668	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I told Tracy there was nothing I could do if he did n’t come see me , and we both know Hell will freeze over before that happens . First , he ’d have to admit he was having problems and he ’s a stubborn son of a bitch . He ’ll almost have to be on death ’s bed before he seeks help . ”
80687	80695	80674	80674	we	1581	“ Maybe you could talk to him ? ”
80696	80755	80756	80756	We	1584	“ Talk to him ? Are you kidding me ? I am not talking to him . If he does n’t think he has a problem , there ’s nothing I can do . Plus , I might punch him for what he said to you . So I do n’t think you want me talking to him . ”
80770	80778	80762	80762	she	1586	“ I thought you ’d never ask . ”
80797	80812	80785	80785	I	0	“ I ’ve been waiting to take you out of this dress all night . ”
80830	80840	80825	80825	she	63	“ Are you okay ? You ’re walking weird . ”
80841	80844	80850	80850	she	1586	“ Really ? ”
80857	80860	80850	80850	she	1586	“ What ? ”
80867	80896	80861	80861	I	0	“ We did it like four times last night . And pretty rough , may I add . Excuse me if I ’m a little sore and inflamed . ”
80897	80902	80903	80903	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
80906	80923	80924	80924	I	0	“ Let me take a look . I can kiss it and make it all better . ”
80927	80966	80924	80924	I	0	“ Absolutely not ! You are n’t going anywhere near there for at least a couple of days . So keep your dick in your pants , Dr. Finn , because my pleasure box is closed for maintenance . ”
80967	80972	80973	80973	I	0	“ Damn , Grace . ”
80976	80996	80973	80973	I	0	“ Since you put it that way , I ’m afraid your pleasure box is now a hazardous zone . ”
80997	81005	81006	81006	She	1587	“ That ’s right . Remember that ! ”
81049	81055	81056	81056	I	0	“ What do we have ? ”
81069	81105	81056	81056	I	0	“ Krista Reeves , thirty - three - year - old female who is thirty - six weeks pregnant . She fell down a couple of stairs and is complaining of back and abdominal pain . ”
81106	81111	81112	81112	I	0	“ Hi , Krista . ”
81115	81129	81112	81112	I	0	“ I ’m Dr. Harper . Let ’s see what ’s going on . ”
81144	81151	81152	81152	I	0	“ Did you hit your head ? ”
81155	81164	81152	81152	I	0	“ No . My back is killing me . ”
81165	81172	81130	81130	We	1590	“ Dr. Lasher , page OB . ”
81173	81180	81181	81181	I	0	“ Right away , Dr. Harper . ”
81195	81201	81202	81202	she	1587	“ OH MY GOD ! ! ”
81213	81247	81205	81205	she	1587	“ Your baby looks great , Krista , and it appears you are in labor . Dr. Lasher , let ’s get an X - ray of her back just to be safe . ”
81248	81279	81308	81308	she	1587	“ Make it stop , Dr. Harper . I ca n’t have this baby yet . My husband is out of town on business . He ’s due back tomorrow . ”
81280	81301	81302	81302	She	1587	“ I ’m going to examine you to see what ’s going on with your cervix . Is that okay ? ”
81325	81337	81338	81338	I	0	“ Krista , your baby is coming . Where ’s OB ? ”
81343	81351	81338	81338	I	0	“ She ’s in surgery right now . ”
81352	81355	81356	81356	Krista	181	“ FUCK ! ”
81359	81388	81356	81356	Krista	181	“ We need to deliver your baby , Krista , so I ’m going to need you to take in a deep breath and get ready to push . ”
81389	81439	81338	81338	I	0	“ No . I ca n’t without my husband . I need him here . I need his support . We were supposed to do this together . I ’m not pushing until he gets here . Do what you have to . Push that baby back up there . ”
81440	81448	81356	81356	Krista	181	“ Dr. Lasher , hold her hand . ”
81449	81457	81458	81458	Krista	181	“ No . I need my husband , ”

81471	81478	81479	81479	I	0	“ How about a substitute husband ? ”
81490	81496	81497	81497	she	181	“ What do you mean ? ”
81500	81521	81497	81497	she	181	“ I can get you someone in here to help you out and you can pretend he ’s your husband . ”
81530	81545	81527	81527	I	0	“ I ca n’t do it . I ’m not having this baby yet . ”
81546	81577	81595	81596	Dr. Lasher	117	“ I ’m sorry , Krista , but your baby is coming whether you like it or not . Trust me , you will like who I have in mind . ”
81578	81581	81582	81582	she	1593	“ Fine , ”

81673	81727	81670	81670	he	51	“ My patient is having her baby and she refuses to push until her husband gets here and he ’s out of town at the moment . So I need you to be her pretend husband and tell her to push and support her so she can deliver this baby without any complications . ”
81728	81735	81642	81642	he	51	“ You ca n’t be serious ? ”

82147	82161	82144	82144	I	0	“ Do n’t ever do that to me again . You owe me . ”
82162	82169	82170	82170	He	51	“ Fine . Whatever you want . ”
82179	82191	82170	82170	He	51	“ You ’re going to regret saying that , Dr. Harper . ”
82274	82277	82278	82278	I	0	“ Tracy ? ”

82413	82422	82423	82423	I	0	“ Let ’s take him to room three , ”
82426	82453	82423	82423	I	0	“ Dr. Lasher , I want a comprehensive metabolic panel , CBC with Diff and blood gases . Get him on an IV drip and oxygen . ”

82476	82508	82469	82469	We	1604	“ He ’s been sick for a couple of months , but he refused to seek medical attention . Do you know what could be wrong ? I ’m so worried . ”
82509	82526	82527	82527	I	0	“ We have to run some tests . Hopefully , we ’ll have some answers soon . ”
82542	82553	82554	82554	I	0	“ Order an MRI with contrast and get him upstairs , ”
82560	82565	82566	82566	Carlyle	136	“ This is ridiculous , ”
82571	82577	82578	82578	I	0	“ Carlyle , shut up , ”
82581	82613	82578	82578	I	0	“ You ’re sick and you need medical treatment . So , for the love of God , just be quiet and let us find out what ’s wrong with you . ”
82614	82626	82566	82566	Carlyle	136	“ I ’ve had enough of your mouth , young lady . ”
82627	82648	82578	82578	I	0	“ And I ’ve had enough of yours . Excuse me for a moment . I ’ll be right back . ”
82675	82689	82690	82690	he	51	“ Hello , Dr. Harper . To what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
82693	82703	82690	82690	he	51	“ How much longer are you going to be ? ”
82704	82715	82578	82578	I	0	“ I ’d say about fifteen more minutes . Why ? ”
82716	82728	82775	82775	He	51	“ I need to speak to you when you ’re done . ”

82877	82884	82818	82818	Renata	70	“ Yeah . I think so . ”
82885	82891	82818	82818	Renata	70	“ Does Jamieson know yet ? ”

82913	82922	82909	82909	She	70	“ This is n’t going to be pretty . ”
82940	82949	82950	82950	he	51	“ What ’s going on with your patient ? ”
82953	82968	82950	82950	he	51	“ Jamieson , it ’s your father . He ’s down in the ER . ”
82969	82973	82909	82909	She	70	“ For what ? ”
82974	83018	83019	83019	He	51	“ Tracy called 911 and had him transported by ambulance . He ’s been in bed the past couple of days with a migraine and vomiting . She also said he fell the other day and he has n’t been sleeping at all . ”
83033	83042	83043	83043	he	51	“ Did you order an MRI with contrast ? ”
83046	83057	83058	83058	I	0	“ I did . He should be in there now . ”
83066	83072	83058	83058	I	0	“ Then let ’s go . ”
83106	83111	83112	83112	Jamieson	51	“ Here they come , ”
83127	83131	83115	83115	He	51	“ Is that — ”
83137	83145	83132	83132	I	0	“ It sure is . Damn it ! ”
83146	83153	83181	83181	Jamieson	51	“ Jamieson , I ’m sorry . ”
83154	83176	83132	83132	I	0	“ We better go tell him . I ’m the last person he ’s going to want to hear this from . ”
83217	83225	83208	83208	We	1611	“ Dad . How are you feeling ? ”
83226	83233	83132	83132	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? ”
83234	83241	83208	83208	We	1611	“ I work here , remember ? ”
83242	83274	83208	83208	We	1611	“ I know that , but I do n’t need you down here , so tell your step - mother that she wasted all of our time by bringing me here . ”
83275	83286	83132	83132	I	0	“ Dad , I read the results of your MRI . ”
83287	83300	83301	83301	he	1616	“ Why would you do that ? You ’re not my doctor , ”
83304	83328	83301	83301	he	1616	“ Dr. Harper came to me , not because you were my father , but because she suspected you needed a neuro consult . ”
83329	83338	83339	83339	I	0	“ And ? Spit it out , Jamieson . ”
83343	83361	83339	83339	I	0	“ You have a tumor on your brainstem . It ’s what we call a brainstem glioma . ”
83362	83366	83367	83367	Tracy	135	“ Brain cancer ? ”
83370	83382	83367	83367	Tracy	135	“ Yes , Tracy , that ’s what a glioma is , ”

83400	83415	83416	83416	She	135	“ Then you ’ll have it removed and you ’ll be fine . Right ? ”
83421	83475	83416	83416	She	135	“ Where the tumor is located on the brainstem , it ’s nearly impossible to remove . To be honest , I ’ve never seen one in this part of the brainstem . Even a partial resection would n’t help . We can try to shrink it with radiation and a chemotherapy cocktail . ”
83476	83483	83484	83485	my father	2030	“ How long do I have ? ”
83489	83506	83484	83485	my father	2030	“ And be honest . Do n’t try to sugarcoat the fact that I ’m dying . ”

83542	83566	83531	83531	Grace	63	“ You ’re a world - class neurosurgeon . You ’ve removed even the most impossible tumors and you will remove this one . ”
83567	83577	83536	83536	her	63	“ Dad . I do n’t think you understand . ”
83578	83620	83621	83621	he	1620	“ No ! You do n’t understand , Jamieson . I ’m not ready to leave this world yet and I ’m not ready to leave my wife . You will remove this tumor from me and give me more time , ”
83624	83646	83621	83621	he	1620	“ Prove to me that you can do the impossible . Prove to me that this is why you chose neurosurgery . ”
83647	83661	83662	83662	Grace	63	“ Carlyle , I do n’t think you understand the significant risks involved , ”
83665	83689	83662	83662	Grace	63	“ I know all the risks and I ’m willing to take them . Now I need my son to do the same . ”
83690	83714	83715	83715	I	0	“ You could die on that operating table , or worse yet , come out of the surgery with an impact of deficits , ”
83718	83729	83730	83730	he	1620	“ Then you ’ll make sure that does n’t happen , ”
83733	83764	83730	83730	he	1620	“ I ’m not making any promises . I ’m going to order brain mapping tests and we ’ll go from there . Until then , Grace is admitting you . ”
83780	83816	83772	83772	Grace	63	“ He ’s asking me to do something I ca n’t do . He ’s just doing this so I ’ll fail and then he can really hate me for the time he has left . ”
83817	83825	83730	83730	he	1620	“ That ’s not true , Jamieson . ”
83826	83833	83834	83834	I	0	“ Yes it is , Grace ! ”
83837	83856	83834	83834	I	0	“ He ’s a doctor , he knows the risks . He ’s doing this to hurt me . ”
83867	83915	83857	83857	She	63	“ You love challenges . You told me there was no way Justin was ever going to walk again . You shut down my electrode suggestion . Then you researched it more and figured it out . You did what those doctors in Switzerland failed to do . ”
83916	83926	83862	83862	her	63	“ This is different , and you know it . ”
83927	83936	83857	83857	She	63	“ Not really . Just think about it . ”
83942	83950	83951	83951	She	63	“ I have a trauma coming in . ”
83955	83960	83951	83951	She	63	“ Think about it . ”
84028	84041	84045	84045	she	70	“ Dr. Finn , can I speak to you for a moment ? ”
84051	84054	84045	84045	she	70	“ Sure . ”
84060	84087	84045	84045	she	70	“ I told your father that it is against hospital policy to let a family member treat him , and that I ca n’t allow it . ”
84088	84096	84045	84045	she	70	“ What did he say to that ? ”
84097	84132	84045	84045	she	70	“ He told me that you are operating on him and if I have a problem with it , he will get in touch with his friends on the board and have me fired . ”
84133	84140	84045	84045	she	70	“ Yep . Sounds like him . ”
84141	84156	84045	84045	she	70	“ It ’s not fair that he ’s doing this to you , Jamieson . ”
84157	84166	84045	84045	she	70	“ He ’s never been a fair man . ”
84167	84180	84183	84183	her	1626	“ If you ca n’t truly do it , then do n’t . ”
84189	84207	84181	84181	She	1626	“ There are just some things we doctors ca n’t do and you have to realize that . ”
84208	84217	84183	84183	her	1626	“ I know , Renata . Thank you . ”
84218	84226	84227	84227	she	1626	“ Let me know what you decide , ”
84266	84271	84272	84272	she	63	“ Are you okay ? ”
84289	84302	84303	84303	I	0	“ I think I figured out a way to remove the tumor . ”
84311	84314	84303	84303	I	0	“ What ? ”
84323	84343	84315	84315	She	63	“ It ’s going to take at least twelve hours , and that ’s providing there are no complications . ”
84344	84349	84350	84350	She	63	“ Are you sure ? ”
84358	84374	84352	84352	her	63	“ Not really , but I have to try . We can tell him tomorrow . ”
84399	84408	84409	84409	he	2030	“ I want Grace in there assisting you , ”
84412	84417	84418	84418	I	0	“ What ? Why ? ”
84421	84443	84418	84418	I	0	“ Because she ’s a snippy little thing and she ’ll set you straight if something goes wrong and you panic . ”
84444	84452	84491	84491	her	63	“ Dad , I do n’t think — ”
84453	84479	84480	84480	I	0	“ This is my brain you ’re cutting into and if I want Dr. Harper in that room , then she better damn well be . ”
84494	84500	84501	84501	I	0	“ You heard the man , ”
84506	84517	84501	84501	I	0	“ Okay . I ’ll be in there , Carlyle . ”
84535	84552	84553	84553	he	2030	“ By the way , why have n’t you two told me that you got married ? ”
84570	84576	84577	84577	he	2030	“ The nurse told me , ”
84580	84585	84586	84586	I	0	“ It ’s complicated , ”
84589	84603	84586	84586	I	0	“ We were both drunk and it will be annulled in three months . ”
84604	84609	84610	84610	he	2030	“ Why three months ? ”
84613	84629	84610	84610	he	2030	“ That ’s another complicated story . One I ’ll tell you after your surgery . ”
84630	84640	84586	84586	I	0	“ Jamieson , can I speak with you alone ? ”
84641	84644	84645	84645	I	0	“ Sure . ”
84650	84658	84645	84645	I	0	“ I ’ll talk to you later . ”
84659	84663	84664	84665	my father	2030	“ Come here , ”
84690	84713	84680	84680	he	2030	“ You are a brilliant surgeon and I want you to know how proud I am to have you as my son . ”
84714	84717	84645	84645	I	0	“ Dad — ”
84718	84745	84664	84665	my father	2030	“ Let me finish . If something happens to me , I do n’t want you to blame yourself . Promise me that you wo n’t . ”
84746	84755	84680	84680	he	2030	“ Nothing is going to happen , Dad . ”
84756	84819	84645	84645	I	0	“ Come on , Jamieson . We ’re both doctors and we know this surgery has way too many risks . Risks I ’m willing to take to give me more time with my family . I want to make right the things I ’ve done wrong , especially where you ’re concerned . I ’m sorry , son , for everything . ”
84820	84827	84664	84665	my father	2030	“ I ’m sorry , Dad . ”
84828	84854	84680	84680	he	2030	“ Do n’t be . If my father would have treated me the way I treated you , I would have acted the same way . ”
85263	85282	85254	85255	the judge	1012	“ Hello , Dr. Finn . Dr. Harper . It ’s good to see both of you again . ”
85283	85289	85290	85290	we	1647	“ Hello , your Honor , ”
85294	85344	85290	85290	we	1647	“ I was hoping that this court date would be cancelled by the both of you because you decided you did n’t want the annulment . So I ’m going to ask each of you separately one question . Dr. Finn , do you still want your marriage annulled ? ”
85345	85354	85355	85355	I	0	“ Yes , your Honor . I do , ”
85358	85378	85355	85355	I	0	“ Dr. Harper , are you in agreement with Dr. Finn ? Do you also want your marriage annulled ? ”
85395	85398	85399	85399	Tony	145	“ Grace ? ”
85402	85411	85399	85399	Tony	145	“ Yes , your Honor . I do . ”
85412	85441	85442	85442	She	63	“ Okay , then . It is by the order of this court that the marriage between Dr. Jamieson Finn and Dr. Grace Harper be annulled effective immediately . ”
85458	85481	85482	85482	She	63	“ I ’m sorry for the both of you , but I hope you learned a valuable lesson . Court is adjourned . ”
85564	85571	85552	85552	He	1660	“ Grace , I ’m sorry . ”
85572	85577	85578	85578	I	0	“ Do n’t be , ”
85589	85648	85578	85578	I	0	“ We knew this day was coming . So now you ’re a free man . Just like you wanted . If you ’ll excuse me , I was paged while we were in court . I have to get back to the hospital . I will have my things out of your house as soon as possible . ”
85649	85666	85581	85581	I	0	“ Grace , please . Do n’t leave like this . Clearly , you ’re upset . ”
85667	85680	85681	85681	I	0	“ My patients come first . Not you and not this situation . ”
85979	85991	85992	85992	I	0	“ Grace , open up . It ’s Renata , sweetheart . ”
86030	86036	86037	86037	She	1669	“ Come here , baby . ”
86041	86048	86037	86037	She	1669	“ I brought you some food . ”
86049	86055	86056	86056	I	0	“ I ’m not hungry . ”
86061	86071	86056	86056	I	0	“ Can I make you some coffee or tea ? ”
86072	86116	86037	86037	She	1669	“ No . I will make it for you . Go sit down . I want to make one thing clear to you . You are not quitting the hospital because of him . You do n’t give him that kind of power . ”
86117	86176	86037	86037	She	1669	“ After everything we ’ve been through the past six months , how can he just throw it all away ? I was such a fool . I truly thought he loved me . I could feel it . And the way he did n’t even hesitate when the judge asked him if he still wanted the annulment . ”
86177	86199	86200	86200	She	1670	“ He ’s the one who ’s a fool . Not you . You ’re going to be okay , Grace . ”
86212	86257	86200	86200	She	1670	“ I do n’t think I will be . Not this time . My heart is so broken , and I do n’t think it will ever heal . I have never loved anyone like I loved him . He destroyed me , Renata . ”
86258	86386	86037	86037	She	1669	“ Now you listen to me . I ’m giving you tough love here . Just like I did when you were my resident . You do n’t let any man destroy you . Especially Dr. Jamieson Finn . You are a brilliant surgeon and a kind and compassionate woman . You have so much to offer and he ’s the idiot that ca n’t see it . What he did is a reflection of him , not you . He will be forever working out his mommy and daddy issues . Alone , may I add ! You ’re going to meet someone special and have a family , and he ’ll be sitting in his lonely beach house wishing he ’d never let you go . ”
86387	86410	86200	86200	She	1670	“ I doubt it . I do n’t want to meet anyone else . I really thought we had a future together . ”
86418	86461	86200	86200	She	1670	“ The only future Jamieson Finn has is the lonely path he ’s walking . He may not realize it now . It may take ten or twenty years , but he will one day . I could just kill that man ! ”
86596	86606	86607	86607	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry . Please forgive me . ”
86701	86711	86712	86712	I	0	“ Did Dr. Harper page me for a consult ? ”
86716	86733	86734	86734	She	63	“ No . Dr. Harper is n’t here . She took a personal leave of absence . ”
86741	86747	86734	86734	She	63	“ Dr. Wilson paged you . ”
86748	86761	86714	86714	Jackie	112	“ What do you mean she took a personal leave of absence ? ”
86762	86801	86802	86802	Her	63	“ It ’s really none of your business , Dr. Finn . You are no longer her husband , so you do n’t have the right to know anything concerning her . Do n’t you have a consult ? ”
86837	86855	86856	86856	Logan	95	“ There you are . I figured I ’d find you here . How are you doing ? ”
86859	86868	86869	86869	I	0	“ How do you think I ’m doing ? ”
86872	86925	86869	86869	I	0	“ Do n’t give me an attitude , man . You ’re doing this to yourself . If you want my honest opinion , I think you majorly suck and you ’re playing roulette . There ’s no guarantee she ’ll ever take you back . I ’m not sure I would . ”
86926	86938	87033	87033	He	1683	“ I did n’t ask for your opinion , did I ? ”
86939	86959	86869	86869	I	0	“ Look at you . You ’re miserable . Swallow your damn pride and beg her to forgive you . ”
86960	86973	86974	86974	I	0	“ Do n’t you have bones you need to set or something ? ”
86981	87032	87033	87033	He	1683	“ Sorry , but I ca n’t side with you on this . It ’s wrong on so many levels . I know you ’re used to playing with women ’s emotions , but Grace just is n’t any ordinary woman and you know it . She ’s the one . ”
87038	87067	87068	87068	He	1683	“ And you ’ve gone and fucked all that up . I can honestly say , Jamieson , that I do n’t even know who you are anymore . ”
87122	87128	87129	87129	My	0	“ You ’re running again . ”
87141	87156	87133	87133	her	66	“ No , I ’m not . This is an excellent opportunity for me . ”
87157	87213	87133	87133	her	66	“ You ’re running , Grace . You ran from New York because of a man and now you ’re running from California for the same reason . Is this what you ’re going to keep doing every time a man hurts you ? It ’s unhealthy and I thought you were stronger than that . ”
87214	87235	87133	87133	her	66	“ I am strong , Aunt Cora , and like I said , this is a step up for me . ”
87236	87239	87240	87240	she	1687	“ Bullshit , ”
87243	87262	87240	87240	she	1687	“ If you were still with Jamieson , you would n’t be doing this . You ’re running ! ”
87263	87290	87133	87133	her	66	“ Fine . I ’m running ! I ca n’t stay here and work at the same hospital as him . It hurts too damn much . ”
87291	87336	87133	87133	her	66	“ I know it hurts . I was in your shoes before . Many many years ago before your parents died . But you know what I did ? I stayed because I was strong , and I had something to prove to myself . ”
87337	87343	87344	87344	I	0	“ And what was that ? ”
87347	87455	87344	87344	I	0	“ That I would not allow one person to dictate and control my entire life . You , my love , can rise up from anything . You can completely recreate yourself . All that matters is that you decide today and you never look back . So what if you ’ll see him at the hospital . Yes , it will hurt like hell for a while , but you ’ll get over it . You ’ll move on and , ultimately , you ’ll be glad things worked out the way they did . Face the anger , sweetheart . Do n’t run from it . ”
87794	87800	87801	87801	I	0	“ Is Grace back yet ? ”
87805	87808	87809	87809	she	63	“ Nope , ”
87822	87829	87809	87809	she	63	“ Where the hell is she ? ”
87830	87841	87816	87816	she	63	“ A personal leave . I already told you that . ”
87842	87847	87816	87816	she	63	“ For how long ? ”
87848	87863	87809	87809	she	63	“ I do n’t know . I guess whenever she decides to come back . ”
87864	87871	87816	87816	she	63	“ Have you spoken to her ? ”
87872	87892	87893	87893	I	0	“ Even if I did , I would n’t tell you . You lost that right , Dr. Finn . ”
88025	88034	88015	88015	Billy	58	“ Hey , Grace . How are you ? ”
88035	88046	88015	88015	Billy	58	“ I ’m good , Billy . How are you ? ”
88047	88063	88015	88015	Billy	58	“ No complaints . I have n’t seen you at the hospital in a while . ”
88064	88076	88015	88015	Billy	58	“ I took a personal leave of absence for a bit . ”
88077	88083	88015	88015	Billy	58	“ Oh . Everything okay ? ”
88084	88095	88015	88015	Billy	58	“ Yeah . Everything is okay . How ’s Holly ? ”
88096	88116	88117	88117	He	58	“ She ’s great . We just celebrated our five - year anniversary last night . Five blissful years . ”
88138	88145	88134	88134	She	1707	“ Please do n’t hurt me . ”
88146	88156	88157	88157	Billy	58	“ Stay here , Grace , and get down , ”
88166	88173	88160	88160	he	58	“ All of you get down . ”
88389	88396	88397	88403	The guy in the green ski mask	1720	“ Noah , come on man . ”
88442	88448	88449	88449	I	0	“ I ’m a doctor , ”
88453	88460	88449	88449	I	0	“ I can help your friend . ”
88461	88469	88435	88435	he	2550	“ What kind of doctor are you ? ”
88470	88477	88449	88449	I	0	“ I ’m a trauma surgeon . ”
88478	88503	88504	88504	he	2550	“ Then get over here and help him . He ’s my brother and he ca n’t die . Do you understand me ? ! ”
88507	88513	88504	88504	he	2550	“ Yes . I understand . ”
88514	88530	88531	88531	I	0	“ Do n’t try nothing funny , lady , or I ’ll put you down . ”
88548	88571	88531	88531	I	0	“ His pulse is weak and he ’s losing a lot of blood . We need to get him to the hospital . ”
88572	88593	88594	88594	he	2550	“ No ! No hospital . You said you ’re a doctor and you ’ll fix him up right here ! ”
88604	88607	88597	88597	he	2550	“ Okay . ”
88614	88639	88608	88608	I	0	“ But I ’m going to need supplies . I need gauze , plastic tubing , a large water jug , and a knife . ”
88640	88654	88597	88597	he	2550	“ A knife . What the fuck do you need a knife for ? ”
88655	88708	88608	88608	I	0	“ I need to make a chest tube and insert it to drain the blood and fluid from his chest . If I do n’t do this quickly , he will die ! I need you to place your hand on his wound and apply pressure to try and control the bleeding . ”
88709	88755	88597	88597	he	2550	“ No way . I ’m not taking my gun off you . You two , go get her what she needs and make it quick ! You , in the purple shirt , get over here and apply pressure to my brother ’s wound ! ”
88788	88795	88796	88796	I	0	“ Noah , stay with me , ”

88817	88828	88812	88814	the other gunmen	1724	“ We need to get the hell out of here . ”
88829	88842	88843	88843	I	0	“ Your brother can not be moved . He ’s not stable ! ”
88846	88851	88843	88843	I	0	“ Then stabilize him ! ”
88907	88911	88912	88912	he	1727	“ You bitch ! ”
88935	88985	88912	88912	he	1727	” I laid there as I heard more gunshots being fired in the distance . Pain coursed through my body as I trembled . I was in shock and I could feel myself slipping away . Before I knew it , two paramedics were kneeling down next to me . “
88995	89004	88992	88993	Dr. Harper	63	” I faintly heard one of them say . “

And I needed you to move out because I had to make sure that I did n’t just grow comfortable with you . I love you , Grace . I always have , but I would n’t admit it to myself . I fought like hell to bury the feelings I had for you . I felt it that night back in New York , but it did n’t matter because I was never supposed to see you again . Then you show up here , and it scared me . I needed that time alone to prove to myself that what we had was so real and special . I know that ’s really fucked up . Hell , if it makes you feel better , I hate myself for doing it and I always will . I will never forgive myself for hurting you the way I did . When I came home that night and saw all your things were gone , my world went black . I tried to tell myself that I ’d be okay , but I was n’t . I was far from it . I have never loved anyone so much in my life . I need you to believe that . I gave everything great thought from the first night we met . I do n’t believe in natural forces or any of that woohoo stuff , but something or someone made sure we met and made sure we stayed in each other ’s lives . It was n’t a coincidence us meeting in New York and then you moving here to Los Angeles and taking a job in the same hospital . I had been in pain for so long and you had your issues with Sam , and we both needed each other . I now believe that there is someone out there that is made for one person , and you , Grace Harper , are my person . The person I was supposed to fall in love with . ”

91304	91312	91298	91298	He	1769	“ How much time do you need ? ”
