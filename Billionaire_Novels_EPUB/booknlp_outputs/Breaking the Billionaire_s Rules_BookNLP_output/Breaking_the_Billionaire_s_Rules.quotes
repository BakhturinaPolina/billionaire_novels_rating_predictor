6712	6753	6709	6709	Jada	113	“ And he was not primal or in any way crazoo in bed . Because it was all Max Hilton ’s material . Why am I just finding out about this now ? I need to read this whole book ! ”
6754	6759	6760	6760	Kelsey	80	“ Mia knows him , ”
6763	6771	6760	6760	Kelsey	80	“ They went to the Shiz together . ”
6772	6780	6781	6781	Jada	113	“ Max Hilton went to the Shiz ? ”
6784	6795	6781	6781	Jada	113	“ What was he studying , utter jackhole - ishness ? ”
6796	6799	6800	6800	I	0	“ Yes , ”
6809	6835	6800	6800	I	0	“ You could major in theater arts , classical music , or utter jackhole - ishness . Max was an A student in the latter . ”
6845	6857	6858	6858	Jada	113	“ And his name was Maxfield Miller . Not Max Hilton . ”
6863	6867	6858	6858	Jada	113	“ The Shiz ? ”
6868	6874	6875	6875	I	0	“ Yup . Classical piano , ”
6890	6896	6897	6897	She	113	“ A little bit jazz . ”
6909	6919	6897	6897	She	113	“ Piano ? Max Hilton can play … piano ? ”
6920	6923	6924	6924	Kelsey	80	“ Dude , ”
6930	6937	6938	6938	She	80	“ He got into the Shiz . ”
6968	7012	6938	6938	She	80	“ He comes from a classical music dynasty — don’t you know that ? His father is some famous conductor , and his mother is Gloria Perez , the violinist . And he and Mia were high school rivals in a bitter feud . ”
7013	7019	7020	7020	Jada	113	“ You hated each other ? ”
7023	7032	7020	7020	Jada	113	“ Ninety - nine percent of the time . ”
7039	7044	7033	7033	I	0	“ Go for it . ”
7182	7193	7176	7176	Jada	113	“ Max Hilton got into the Shiz for classical piano ? ”
7197	7213	7176	7176	Jada	113	“ Yup . But his true talent ? Really dorky old - timey show tunes . ”
7214	7217	7218	7218	Jada	113	“ No ! ”
7221	7251	7218	7218	Jada	113	“ You should hear him sing songs from Oklahoma ! playing the aw - shucks lovesick cowpoke , Curly McLain . Goofy comic songs . I ’m telling you . ”
7266	7279	7260	7260	Kelsey	80	“ Definitely the last thing I can imagine out of Max Hilton . ”
7390	7400	7385	7388	a goofy singing cowboy	382	“ Is this something we can find on YouTube ? ”
7404	7412	7401	7401	Jada	113	“ Pretty please , please say yes ? ”
7413	7443	7444	7444	I	0	“ Do you think , with all of Max Hilton ’s money and power , that he would allow a YouTube of him singing goofy to be out there ? ”
7447	7466	7444	7444	I	0	“ That he and his people would n’t put the boot down on something like that so hard ? ”
7518	7532	7533	7533	Kelsey	80	“ How did you never tell any of us this bit of gossip ? ”
7587	7593	7594	7594	Jada	113	“ But you witnessed it ? ”
7597	7615	7594	7594	Jada	113	“ I was in the summer production with him . I sang opposite him . So yeah . ”
7635	7641	7642	7642	Jada	113	“ And you were enemies , ”
7645	7665	7666	7666	I	0	“ We made careers out of humiliating each other . Max ’s business partner Parker went there , too , ”
7669	7679	7666	7666	I	0	“ It ’s just old Shiz week over there . ”
7680	7703	7704	7704	Kelsey	80	“ And guess which Meow Squad delivery cat is going to have to deliver his lunch from now on ? Starting tomorrow ? ”
7710	7713	7707	7707	Jada	113	“ No ! ”
7716	7724	7707	7707	Jada	113	“ Not that it ’s that bad . ”
7725	7730	7731	7731	I	0	“ Do n’t even , ”
7734	7763	7731	7731	I	0	“ I have to be a servile minion to my high school rival . Wearing a cat suit . And he ’s a billionaire in a gleaming tower . ”
7771	7786	7787	7787	Jada	113	“ Would you be fired if you let your friend Jada poison his sandwich ? ”
7882	7887	7888	7888	I	0	“ Oh my god ! ”
7891	7898	7888	7888	I	0	“ Antonio , I completely forgot . ”
8020	8037	8038	8038	I	0	“ You guys remember my cousin Antonio , right ? We were supposed to run lines . ”
8044	8050	8038	8038	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
8051	8060	8061	8061	Kelsey	80	“ We ’ll all run lines with you . ”
8073	8100	8061	8061	Kelsey	80	“ First you have to tell the truth , though — do you recognize this book ? Have you ever used it to pick up women ? ”
8122	8139	8101	8101	Antonio	119	“ A pickup book ? I ’m a male model with an Italian accent , cara … ”
8140	8150	8151	8151	I	0	“ True , he does n’t need the book , ”
8154	8178	8151	8151	I	0	“ Unless it ’s to drive off women by beating them over the head with it . He could use it for that . ”
8192	8195	8196	8196	He	119	“ Americans . ”
8203	8231	8232	8232	We	396	“ ‘ Never ask a woman what she wants — tell her what she wants . You are a capricious god and she is your subject . ’ ”
8251	8261	8262	8262	Antonio	119	“ Such stuff would work on men , too , ”
8269	8283	8262	8262	Antonio	119	“ You could wrap a man around your little finger with these techniques . ”
8284	8292	8293	8293	I	0	“ If you ’re an awful person , ”
8303	8327	8328	8328	He	119	“ But if you wanted to bring a man to his knees . Some of them would perhaps need to be adjusted but … ”
8333	8341	8328	8328	He	119	“ This is what I ’m saying . ”
8342	8345	8346	8346	Kelsey	80	“ Seriously ? ”
8349	8363	8346	8346	Kelsey	80	“ You honestly think these techniques could bring a guy to his knees ? ”
8364	8368	8369	8369	he	119	“ Of course , ”
8440	8449	8434	8434	her	80	“ Maybe even bring Max to his knees ? ”
8473	8482	8463	8463	I	0	“ What are you thinking here , Kelsey ? ”
8483	8490	8491	8491	she	80	“ I ’m thinking about justice , ”
8494	8497	8491	8491	she	80	“ Yes ! ”
8507	8520	8498	8498	Jada	113	“ Justice . You could show him how it feels , Mia . ”
8521	8531	8532	8532	I	0	“ I ’m not doing pickup techniques on Max , ”
8535	8560	8532	8532	I	0	“ It ’s not about pickup techniques , it ’s about showing him how it feels to have somebody work a system on him , ”
8564	8575	8561	8561	Kelsey	80	“ He needs to know . It ’s perfect karma . ”
8576	8582	8583	8583	I	0	“ Except he wrote it , ”
8586	8595	8583	8583	I	0	“ It probably would n’t work on him . ”
8596	8613	8614	8614	Lizzie	76	“ Or maybe it would work on him better than it would work on anyone else , ”
8617	8653	8614	8614	Lizzie	76	“ He wrote a manual on how to get to a person ’s heart . How many hearts do you think he knows firsthand ? One . He only knows one heart . His own . ”
8654	8663	8664	8665	My pals	397	“ You ’re assuming he has a heart . ”
8733	8736	8737	8737	I	0	“ Anyway , ”
8740	8755	8737	8737	I	0	“ I think he ’d recognize somebody running his own golden rules on him . ”
8756	8774	8775	8775	Kelsey	80	“ No way . He ’d never know . He wrote that book almost ten years ago , ”
8778	8846	8775	8775	Kelsey	80	“ My sister writes books . She ca n’t remember anything she wrote even one year back . She says her head fills up with a new book and crowds out the old one . And this guy , he ’s running a billion - dollar business and being all Mister Celeb ? Trust me , Max Hilton has no memory of what ’s in this book . ”
8852	8869	8847	8847	Jada	113	“ Do it ! Teach him a lesson . Make him crawl on his grovelly knees . ”
8870	8889	8890	8890	I	0	“ I do n’t know if it can be done by a person who ’s just delivering sandwiches , ”
8893	8909	8890	8890	I	0	“ And the whole reason he requested my deliveries is to make fun of me . ”
8910	8922	8923	8923	Jada	113	“ You ’ll see him every day . It ’s perfect ! ”
9156	9169	9170	9170	I	0	“ Use his own system to wrap him around my little finger … ”
9177	9187	9170	9170	I	0	“ and then I bring him to his knees . ”
9188	9193	9194	9194	Jada	113	“ His grovelly knees , ”
9285	9290	9291	9291	I	0	“ Okay , then , ”
9294	9312	9291	9291	I	0	“ I ’ll do it . I ’m gon na bring Max Hilton to his grovelly knees . ”
9577	9585	9586	9586	Kelsey	80	“ This one is already a problem . ”
9597	9623	9586	9586	Kelsey	80	“ ‘ Demonstrate your alpha status by wearing standout clothes and otherwise adorning yourself with symbols of your utter superiority . ’ Seems pretty straightforward . ”
9624	9666	9667	9667	Kelsey	80	“ I have to wear the cat outfit . You get fired if you cover it up or do n’t wear it . Seriously , they ’d fire me if I showed up in a gown or a tiara or something . ”
9692	9733	9686	9686	Jada	113	“ It says that you ca n’t hide the ears or put other clothes over the cat suit , but what if you became the most fabulous cat ? There ’s nothing here forbidding you from jazzing up the outfit . ”
9734	9764	9686	9686	Jada	113	“ You guys , the fact that I ’m a delivery girl who has to wear an embarrassing cat outfit is not a quality I want to play up . ”
9765	9771	9772	9772	Kelsey	80	“ Unless you work it ! ”
9775	9787	9772	9772	Kelsey	80	“ You know how to work an outfit better than anyone . ”
9788	9799	9686	9686	Jada	113	“ I ’m not working the Meow Squad delivery outfit . ”
9800	9813	9814	9814	Jada	113	“ I have a glue gun downstairs . And sequins and rhinestones — ”
9817	9824	9825	9825	I	0	“ — that are staying downstairs , ”
9828	9831	9832	9832	Lizzie	76	“ Yessss , ”
9835	9843	9832	9832	Lizzie	76	“ And you ’ll need fake eyelashes . ”
9844	9851	9686	9686	Jada	113	“ Oh my god , no ! ”
9852	9862	9863	9863	Kelsey	80	“ I have those silver go - go boots , ”
9866	9888	9863	9863	Kelsey	80	“ Go get your outfit , Mia . We ’re going to make you the most fabulous delivery cat of all . ”
9889	9906	9907	9907	Jada	113	“ Do n’t you want to bring him to his grovelly knees for all of womankind ? ”
9910	9928	9907	9907	Jada	113	“ While turning the tables on him ? And then crush him under your sparkly silver heel ? ”
9933	9941	9942	9942	She	76	“ This is going to be perfect ! ”
10002	10031	10032	10032	She	80	“ If you do all ten of the golden rules to Max over the course of your deliveries , I ’m putting one hundred dollars toward your Louboutins . ”
10054	10062	10063	10063	Jada	113	“ I ’m in for a hundred , ”

11430	11482	11510	11510	She	124	“ No . It ’s like , the queen of England does n’t actually run the country . I ’m queen of the delivery cats like that . I ’m queen in spirit , in enthusiasm , in adornment . I ’m alpha cat , and these shiny things signify that . ”

16783	16818	16777	16777	she	600	“ And I found half the things he ever told me in the back of that book . I kept giving him chances because of those stories and it was all Max Hilton material ! ”

16854	16906	16851	16851	Francine	134	“ I ’m putting a hundred toward buying your heels because you are so amazing for doing this , and here ’s another hundred from my sister , who fell for half the lines in there . Kelsey told us to read that book , and we ’ve been freaking out . ”
16907	16911	16912	16912	I	0	“ Thank you , ”

16975	16986	16987	16987	I	0	“ It was harder than I thought it would be , ”
16990	17031	16987	16987	I	0	“ It might be a little ambitious , thinking I ’m going to put Max Hilton on his knees . After today , I ’d settle for retaining a shred of dignity . It could not have been more demeaning . ”
17032	17041	17042	17042	Antonio	119	“ Demeaning the woman who inspires my dreams ? ”
17048	17064	17042	17042	Antonio	119	“ Perhaps my character needs to teach this man a lesson he wo n’t forget . ”
17065	17069	17070	17070	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”
17083	17089	17070	17070	I	0	“ It ’s not funny . ”

17173	17181	17182	17182	Jada	113	“ So , you wore the ears ? ”
17186	17191	17182	17182	Jada	113	“ Did he notice ? ”
17192	17271	17152	17152	Antonio	119	“ Hard to say . Max is a man with a carefully curated surface . I know in his pictures he looks all natural and warm and friendly with his enchanting smile , but he ’s a cold , calculating metal robot . He gives you nothing . Though he did try to act like he was surprised that I was there , and then he got off on ordering me around . It was just … uhhh . ”
17281	17286	17287	17287	Francine	134	“ I would die , ”

17333	17353	17300	17300	Jada	113	“ Because we ’re natural enemies in the wild . Why is the lion an asshole to the antelope ? ”
17354	17366	17367	17367	Kelsey	80	“ I think that ’s a negative way of framing it , ”
17370	17388	17367	17367	Kelsey	80	“ It positions you as the prey of the lion . You ’re more like the giraffe . ”
17389	17398	17399	17399	I	0	“ A lion can take down a giraffe , ”
17402	17405	17406	17406	Jada	113	“ Hyena ? ”
17409	17426	17406	17406	Jada	113	“ The lion can rarely get the best of a hyena . You ’re the hyena . ”
17427	17448	17300	17300	Jada	113	“ The hyena . Thank you , Jada . Why not a plague of locusts ? Or a noxious cloud ? ”
17449	17455	17367	17367	Kelsey	80	“ I did n’t mean — ”

17466	17520	17460	17460	I	0	“ Anyway , I ’m a long way to bringing him to his grovelly knees . It ’s not just about his heartless power . There ’s a massive flock of supermodels that will be keeping him from sinking to his grovelly knees for me . With gossamer threads . Lifting him up . ”
17521	17526	17527	17527	Kelsey	80	“ Max Hilton girls , ”

17570	17582	17583	17583	Jada	113	“ Fuck him ? No way , it ’s just publicity , ”
17586	17609	17583	17583	Jada	113	“ Socialites and models and designers use him for his name . And he ’s using them for the Max Hilton illusion . ”
17622	17641	17642	17642	Kelsey	80	“ Yeah , they ’d flee like rats if he went out in sweatpants with socks under sandals . ”
17645	17658	17659	17659	Antonio	119	“ Give them a break . The Max Hilton girls are sweet , ”
17662	17674	17659	17659	Antonio	119	“ They ’re very attractive and clever too . On Instagram … ”
17675	17678	17679	17679	Kelsey	80	“ Uhhh . ”
17716	17720	17710	17710	Antonio	119	“ What ? ! ”
17721	17728	17729	17729	Kelsey	80	“ It ’s PR , Antonio , ”
17732	17740	17729	17729	Kelsey	80	“ That ’s not who they are . ”
17770	17784	17785	17785	Kelsey	80	“ It was only your first day working his own rules on him , ”
17788	17806	17785	17785	Kelsey	80	“ Do we need to get out the Hilton Playbook and read what it says about perseverance ? ”
17810	17813	17807	17807	I	0	“ No . ”
17814	17820	17821	17821	Francine	134	“ What does it say ? ”
17824	17830	17831	17831	Kelsey	80	“ To not get discouraged , ”
17834	17850	17831	17831	Kelsey	80	“ Hold your head up high and keep moving forward . You can do anything . ”
17851	17865	17866	17866	Francine	134	“ As long as you have Max Hilton telling you what to do , ”
17869	17876	17877	17877	Antonio	119	“ It ’s a good system , ”
17901	17912	17913	17913	Jada	113	“ You have to deliver sandwiches to him either way , ”
17917	17960	17913	17913	Jada	113	“ You may as well check off all of the boxes . Worst - case scenario , we buy you those shoes . Best - case scenario , he ’s on his knees and you are wearing them as you crush him . ”
17961	17967	17968	17968	Kelsey	80	“ You can do it ! ”
17983	18005	17968	17968	Kelsey	80	“ Put an X in that box ! You nailed that rule . One golden move down , nine to go . ”
18013	18021	18022	18022	Francine	134	“ And you ’re fighting for us , ”
18025	18073	18022	18022	Francine	134	“ For all of us who went home with a clever , exciting guy and woke up with a loser . You ’re our hero . You ’re showing Max what it ’s like for somebody to do a system on him . Please do n’t quit . ”
18074	18077	18078	18078	Jada	113	“ Pleeeeease , ”
18255	18267	18268	18268	Francine	134	“ One golden rule down , nine to go , bitches ! ”
18397	18405	18406	18406	Kelsey	80	“ What rule are you doing tomorrow ? ”
18414	18421	18409	18409	I	0	“ Reverse - chasing is next . ”
18422	18427	18428	18428	Francine	134	“ Reverse - chasing ? ”
18435	18446	18432	18432	her	80	“ Oh , I know all about reverse - chasing . ”
18456	18534	18453	18453	her	80	“ Reverse - chasing is where you act like the woman you want to pick up is after you , even though she totally is not . And you ’re all like , get away ! Even though she ’s not at all after you , but you act like you think she is , and it intrigues her . Falsely . That ’s how my cheating ex kicked things off . If only I ’d known . ”
18551	18571	18546	18546	she	134	“ So you ’re gon na do it right back at him . What are you gon na say ? ”
18572	18594	18537	18537	her	134	“ I do n’t have it worked out . But I have some ideas . I want it to feel spontaneous . ”
18595	18603	18604	18604	Kelsey	80	“ Mia can improv like a boss , ”
18607	18625	18604	18604	Kelsey	80	“ Mia’ll reverse - chase his ass so hard , he wo n’t know what hit him . ”
18626	18634	18635	18635	Antonio	119	“ Do not forget prize - baiting . ”

18670	18681	18661	18661	He	119	“ I ’ve been working on my backstory , cara . ”
18682	18686	18687	18687	I	0	“ You have ? ”
18722	18731	18732	18732	He	119	“ And when I dress in Hugo Boss ? ”

18746	18762	18763	18763	I	0	“ You in a suit , that ’s probably all we need , right there , ”
18766	18773	18774	18774	he	119	“ But to add this backstory , ”
18777	18832	18774	18774	he	119	“ We ’ll see . I did see Max cross the street from afar , going between his two buildings , before the last delivery . Around eleven . So we could set it up so he sees you talking with me out there , but you would n’t have to interact with him . ”
18833	18841	18842	18842	Kelsey	80	“ You saw him before the delivery ? ”
18845	18902	18842	18842	Kelsey	80	“ Just from afar . I was pretty sure it was him . Max ’s company owns this rehabbed workshop space across the street from Maximillion Plaza . If he goes back and forth often at that time , I could get the driver to park at a spot where Antonio would be visibly admiring me . ”
18908	18922	18903	18903	Antonio	119	“ I will be such a suitor . He will see my passion . ”
18923	18952	18842	18842	Kelsey	80	“ My plan is that you just smile at me a lot and laugh at whatever I say . It does n’t have to be over the top . ”
18953	18962	18842	18842	Kelsey	80	“ He would see my desperation for you . ”
18963	18969	18970	18970	I	0	“ Just passion is good , ”
18973	18980	18970	18970	I	0	“ No , it ’s desperation . ”
18995	19046	18981	18981	Antonio	119	“ I grew up poor in the streets . My father rejected me . My mother was cruel but beautiful . So poor were we that they sold me to a brothel when I was but a boy . I was forced to sell myself in the alleyways of Milano . ”
19047	19057	19058	19058	I	0	“ Double Dark Chocolate Milano is my favorite cookie , ”

19085	19090	19091	19091	Jada	113	“ Sorry , Antonio … ”
19094	19104	19091	19091	Jada	113	“ In America it kind of is a cookie . ”
19105	19117	19118	19118	Antonio	119	“ If you knew the underbelly of Milano as I did , ”
19121	19128	19118	19118	Antonio	119	“ you would not think it . ”
19129	19135	19136	19136	I	0	“ The underbelly of Milano , ”
19139	19153	19154	19154	I	0	“ Is that near the hardscrabble alley behind the Keebler Elves ’ Factory ? ”
19162	19176	19157	19157	Jada	113	“ I believe it ’s located east of the Pepperidge Farms killing fields . ”
19177	19190	19191	19191	Kelsey	80	“ Stop it , you guys ! Let Antonio tell his backstory . ”
19196	19206	19207	19207	Antonio	119	“ Ignore them , Antonio . Please go on . ”
19216	19242	19243	19243	I	0	“ I grew up fighting hoodlums . The fist , the blade . What did I care ? What did ever I see of life ? ”
19249	19260	19243	19243	I	0	“ Too many productions of West Side Story , maybe ? ”
19268	19291	19292	19292	I	0	“ Dude , I ’m just saying you should save this backstory for a real role where you have lines and things , ”
19299	19324	19295	19295	Antonio	119	“ So many shameful acts I did until I hit rock bottom , so desperate was I for a kind word from my mother . ”
19325	19329	19330	19330	Jada	113	“ Your mother ? ”
19333	19342	19330	19330	Jada	113	“ Are you going Jerry Springer on us ? ”
19348	19355	19343	19343	Kelsey	80	“ Come on , you guys ! ”
19356	19366	19367	19367	Antonio	119	“ Italian men prize the love of their mothers , ”
19370	19379	19380	19380	He	119	“ It is a pure and good thing . ”
19385	19403	19380	19380	He	119	“ Then , at my lowest , lying in the gutter , I see your Yummies ad . ”
19404	19413	19414	19414	I	0	“ Oh my god , Antonio , no , ”
19435	19446	19463	19463	Jada	113	“ I do n’t think they have Yummies in Milano . ”
19447	19462	19463	19463	Jada	113	“ They do n’t have Yummies there because all the people are eating Milanos , ”
19525	19562	19520	19520	he	119	“ It is your beauty and talent that inspired me to clean myself up and climb from the gutter and come to America . To seek you out . You are the light of my life . ”
19563	19574	19575	19575	I	0	“ Umm … that ’s an amazing backstory , Antonio , ”
19578	19613	19575	19575	I	0	“ Not that you ’ll be able to use it . But I guess there ’s no harm in having that on your mind as you appear to admire me when Max walks by . ”
19642	19653	19654	19654	he	119	“ Will we kiss ? We could make a signal , ”
19657	19669	19654	19654	he	119	“ I remember every one of your expert stage kissing pointers . ”
19788	19797	19798	19798	I	0	“ We wo n’t need a stage kiss , ”
19802	19828	19798	19798	I	0	“ Your character sounds protective and macho . Maybe he prefers his woman to appear modest . I doubt he ’d wanna go all PDA . ”
19829	19839	19840	19840	he	119	“ Unless he feels his woman is being ogled , ”
19843	19853	19840	19840	he	119	“ Then he would want to claim her publicly . ”
19854	19870	19798	19798	I	0	“ Yeah , but what if she gets carried away and messes up his hair ? ”
19882	19889	19890	19890	he	119	“ She must not do that , ”
19896	19917	19893	19893	I	0	“ Well , it luckily wo n’t come to that . It would just be you looking adoringly at me . ”

25094	25122	25022	25022	she	80	“ How did you guys even co - exist in a summer production . And what was he doing there anyway ? If he was mister classical ? ”
25123	25160	25075	25075	she	80	“ It was part of a crossing genres requirement . Where a teacher puts you in a production out of your comfort zone and the other kids have to help you . He was my lead . ”

25347	25409	25344	25344	I	0	“ And it was a summer show , and summer shows are always weird , like this one was full of younger kids , mostly from other schools . It felt like we were stranded on a deserted island , away from our friends . It was the one time we got along . Or I thought we were getting along . ”
25410	25415	25416	25416	She	80	“ Define getting along . ”
25435	25462	25463	25463	Kelsey	80	“ Okay , I ’m going to confess something to you here — we had kind of a fling . Or , I thought we did . ”
25471	25475	25463	25463	Kelsey	80	“ Excuse me ? ”
25476	25494	25463	25463	Kelsey	80	“ Not a full - blown fling . More like , the stage kisses were getting hot . ”
25495	25498	25499	25499	We	750	“ Switch ! ”
25508	25511	25499	25499	We	750	“ And ? ”
25512	25569	25463	25463	Kelsey	80	“ Let ’s just say we rehearsed the kiss a lot . It was a joke with us — even knocking around backstage , one of us would say , we need to practice that kiss . And we ’d make out . And we ’d get bubble tea afterwards and do homework together and stuff . ”
25570	25573	25574	25574	she	80	“ Mia , ”
25577	25585	25574	25574	she	80	“ You had a fling with him . ”
25586	25638	25463	25463	Kelsey	80	“ I do n’t think it was a fling to him . To him it was more like , he was trapped in an uncool musical with an uncool girl . I was the only person his age there . It was a game for him , as it turned out . ”
25639	25647	25648	25648	I	0	“ This guy is unbelievable . Switch ! ”
25757	25768	25769	25769	I	0	“ My heart would just hammer to think about him , ”
25772	25788	25789	25789	She	80	“ The force of my crush on him could ’ve powered a small nuclear sub . ”
25800	25817	25818	25818	I	0	“ I had this stupid idea that the production of Oklahoma ! was the real him , ”
25824	25853	25818	25818	I	0	“ I thought that I was the only person who knew the real him , and all the rest of his life was the false him . Wrong . ”
25854	25861	25789	25789	She	80	“ He was just playing you . ”
25862	25985	26036	26036	he	753	“ And then school was back in session , and it was the worst . Our texting had been sparse . That should ’ve been an alarm bell . And finally I spotted him at lunch , sitting with his crew . And this happiness just filled me . I had this tray full of spaghetti , and I rushed over there . And he had this weird look on his face . And I started feeling all nervous , and then I was n’t looking where I was going and I tripped and fell on my ass with spaghetti all over my shirt . And my face and hair . And the whole lunchroom erupted in laughter . I was mortified . ”
25986	25990	26036	26036	he	753	“ And Max ? ”
25991	26018	26036	26036	he	753	“ He did nothing . He just watched . My friends rushed to my side , but it ’s like he did n’t care at all . ”
26019	26025	26026	26026	He	753	“ Did you confront him ? ”
26070	26659	26067	26067	you	755	” After our warm - up , we move onto my dance for my audition , a combination of contemporary and classical ballet moves we worked out , and Kelsey picked the music . There are a few combinations I have n’t been nailing , so we concentrate on those . I ’m dead on my feet an hour later . Luckily , it ’s switch - off time . I seat myself at the piano and take Kelsey through her vocal warm - up . We ’ve chosen Midnight Blue as her audition song , but we think if it goes well , the casting director might ask her to sing Blow , Gabriel , Blow , so we ’re preparing that one , too . Getting this show would be so major . As in breakout major . People are saying it ’s going to be the next Waitress . Maybe even the next Hamilton . The group behind it has had massive hits before , so who knows ? Needless to say , the best actors are vying to get a part in this production . Sometimes I ’m afraid to hope for landing the part of confident , sassy Reno , like am I dreaming too big ? But when people who know the show hear I ’m going out for it , their eyes light up . It ’s a very me part . At home I eat rice and cheese and watch YouTube videos . I go to bed early to read , but eventually the evil phone is calling and I ’m on Max ’s Instagram feed . Why I bother , I do n’t know . I guess I have this desire to find out something vulnerable and sensitive about him . A post where he is n’t perfect , either . Where he shows his belly . Some of the posts are familiar to me from late - night Instagram scrolls , or let ’s just call them drunk scroll . There ’s Max with the captain of his yacht . They ’re standing in front of a giant steering wheel and Max ’s hair is all windblown , his cheeks are kissed by the sun and he ’s in a perfectly worn - out T - shirt with some sort of rugged tan shorts , making the captain look like a sad vision of manhood indeed . Caption : Rough weather ahead . Prepare the martini shakers . There ’s a series of pictures of him kissing a short woman with dark , curly hair — definitely not a supermodel . Caption : Happy Saturday . So not the Max Hilton type . I always felt sure it was one of his fans . I scroll past Max sitting in the front row of some basketball game next to the coolest movie stars ever . Caption : Down five points ! Judging by the outpouring of sympathy in the comments , you ’d ’ve thought he was a child trapped in a mine shaft hundreds of feet below the earth ’s surface . There ’s Max the fierce entrepreneur , hands planted on a drafting table , necktie loosened just enough that you can get a hit of his corded neck , and from that infer an entire body of muscular perfection . He ’s surrounded by fiercely photogenic twenty and thirty - somethings in an array of genders , set against the grunge - chic background of his “
26663	27135	26067	26067	you	755	” Caption : Never feels like working when you ’re doing what you love . There ’s an arty shot of a woman in an elevator , head tipped back against the panel , as if in pleasure — you ca n’t see her face because of the light from the elevator chandelier reflected just above her , but a man ’s hand is planted on the panel next to her . Caption : This elevator has everything it needs except a well - stocked liquor cart . Max at work , surrounded by models , and they ’re all laughing their heads off — one guy is doubled over . Caption : Shoot crew made my day . I definitely feel like that caption lies ; if you study the picture long enough , you can see that their energy is directed at him , like he said something funny . He made the shoot crew ’s day , not the other way around , but Max is clever like that . It made him a dangerous enemy . There ’s Max holding a lady ’s hand over a candlelit table . The hand is all of her that we see — the rest of her is cut off , because it ’s Max we care about . But presumably it ’s a Max Hilton girl , possibly it ’s Lana , his most famous Max Hilton girl , the model with a really successful line of capes and boots that even Antonio had heard of . Whoever it is , she has pretty blue fingernails and wears several vintage cocktail rings . And Max gazes intensely across the table at her with an expression that is so full of desire , it makes my heart hurt . Caption : No words . I tell myself it ’s not the girl he ’s looking at , but that ’s a lie , because if you trace the line of his gaze and triangulate from her hand , it ’s obvious that he ’s staring right at her face . But who can say what she ’s doing with the other hand ? I decide she ’s holding a pork chop in front of her face with her other hand , and she ’s about to bite into it . And it ’s the pork chop — and not her — that Max is staring at , lusting over . New Caption : Why the hell did n’t I order the pork chops ? I wonder if she ’ll trade with me . I am Max Hilton , after all . I shut off Instagram . Max Hilton ’s Instagram feed is not helping my mood . But then there ’s that slice of his tower , right out my window . “
27145	27273	27138	27138	I	0	” I say . I give his tower the finger and go get my uniform . I empty the sequins out of my pocket from when I ripped them off my ears in fury — oh my god how Max would ’ve loved to see that . Carefully , I sew them back onto my ears . Because I ’m doing this thing . I ’m fighting him on behalf of all the women who ended up going home with losers because of his stupid book . I sit in bed , hand - sewing them on . I do n’t care what it takes , I ’ll keep alpha - signaling and reverse - chasing and all of the rest until Max sees what he ’s done .

36309	36318	36306	36306	Kelsey	80	“ Well , bees are endangered , so … ”
36319	36325	36326	36326	she	80	“ Squish his overblown ego , ”

And now I fight for you . I will follow you up the high - rise . I am not above helping the object of my affection in her menial chores . And if another man even looks at her sideways . ”
36777	36811	36774	36774	his	119	“ I will slit his throat . Without a moment ’s hesitation , I will do this . I will leave him to die on the street like the dog that he is . ”

36846	36910	36843	36843	He	119	“ And you ’re not following me . You ’ll just be out hanging around at the rendezvous truck where I switch out carts between buildings , and he ’ll see you looking at me adoringly when he walks by . It ’s usually before lunch , or else right after . Okay ? He ’s not going to come talk to us . ”
36911	36917	36818	36818	I	0	“ But if he does … ”
36918	36939	36940	36940	Antonio	119	“ You ’re a guy on your lunch break who wants a date with me . And you say nothing . ”
36946	36953	36954	36954	he	119	“ I would not stay silent , ”

37012	37070	37001	37001	Antonio	119	“ Even the smallest interaction with you , when you ’re loading your lunch cart out on the street , is solace to my darkened soul . Does he think to take you from me ? He ’ll see that the blade is just another tool to me . I am not afraid to tell him that . ”
37071	37083	37084	37084	Kelsey	80	“ Yeah , you do n’t want to scare him off , ”
37089	37107	37084	37084	Kelsey	80	“ Just watch her with that deep look , maybe a smile . You ’ll be amazing . ”
37108	37122	37123	37123	Antonio	119	“ A smile with no subtext is but a shape of the lips . ”
37131	37158	37123	37123	Antonio	119	“ How many men have I killed in this short life ? One does not lurk around after a street fight in the alleyways of Milano . ”

37547	37569	37542	37542	Antonio	119	“ I came to look at her beauty , hoping that it would ease the despair and darkness in my heart . ”
37570	37573	37574	37574	Rollins	126	“ Oh , ”
37577	37584	37574	37574	Rollins	126	“ Antonio , stop being funny . ”

37726	37772	37709	37709	he	119	“ Who is that dog over there who thinks he can look at you ? I will cut out his heart as easily as I ’d plunge a knife into a ripe tomato . Your body is not for men to feast their eyes on . ”
37841	37854	37855	37855	he	119	“ All my problems disappear when I set my eyes upon you , ”
37858	37863	37855	37855	he	119	“ All of them ! ”

38329	38337	38338	38338	I	0	“ You get an extra free one ! ”

40702	40718	40699	40699	Parker	72	“ but that was Mia Corelli . In your office . In a cat suit . ”
40719	40729	40670	40672	A smarter man	1046	“ I know . She ’s been delivering sandwiches . ”
40730	40733	40670	40672	A smarter man	1046	“ And ? ”
40734	40794	40795	40795	I	0	“ There ’s no and . She engineered getting in here somehow . God knows how or why . Apparently Meredith left instructions for the front desk to let her through before she flitted off to her yoga retreat . I ’ve got an email out to her , but it ’s a yoga retreat . In Costa Rica . ”
40798	40822	40795	40795	I	0	“ I know it was Mia , though — she was so clearly unsurprised to be walking into my office that first day . ”
40844	40847	40829	40829	his	72	“ Really . ”
40924	40945	40946	40946	Parker	72	“ Yes , and I ’m sure you ’ll be happy to know that she finds all of this impressive . ”
40949	40956	40946	40946	Parker	72	“ That ’s what she said ? ”
40957	40960	40961	40961	Parker	72	“ Impressive . ”
41019	41028	41007	41007	Impressive	169	“ So , what ’s she up to ? ”
41029	41048	41007	41007	Impressive	169	“ I do n’t know . It ’s not as if I follow her on Facebook or anything . ”
41049	41056	41007	41007	Impressive	169	“ You ’re not catching up ? ”
41057	41072	41007	41007	Impressive	169	“ On the sandwich trends of Manhattan , maybe . She ’s delivering lunch . ”
41073	41081	41082	41082	he	72	“ Right to you in your office , ”
41088	41101	41085	41085	I	0	“ Let ’s have it . Where are we on the campaign ? ”

42930	42942	42977	42977	he	1142	“ Why not ? Did you take an oath of silence ? ”
42943	42956	42977	42977	he	1142	“ No , but … I do n’t want trouble with Antonio . ”
42957	42965	42966	42967	The kid	1142	“ Trouble ? What kind of trouble ? ”
42988	42999	42977	42977	he	1142	“ He has a lot of darkness in his heart . ”
43003	43009	42977	42977	he	1142	“ What does that mean ? ”
43010	43034	43035	43035	I	0	“ You do n’t want to know . Just leave it . And do n’t ask around about him — he ’s dangerous . ”
43049	43069	43073	43073	his	1142	“ I wo n’t have to ask around if you tell me . What do you mean by dangerous ? ”
43076	43101	43073	43073	his	1142	“ Antonio would plunge a knife into your heart as easily as he ’d cut a ripe tomato . That ’s what I mean . ”
43107	43113	43073	43073	his	1142	“ Are you being funny ? ”
43121	43132	43116	43116	he	1142	“ You did n’t hear it from me . Okay ? ”
43140	43148	43116	43116	he	1142	“ He ’s some sort of criminal ? ”
43149	43155	43156	43157	the kid	1142	“ To put it mildly , ”
43160	43233	43234	43234	He	1142	“ The man is a killer from Italy who had very little to live for before Mia . He grew up selling his body on the streets of Roma and getting into knife fights . He ’s killed before . Sliced men to ribbons , and he thinks nothing of sleeping in pools of blood . And there are other things , too . Between him and Mia … it ’s very … ”
43254	43258	43251	43251	I	0	“ Very what ? ”
43259	43270	43236	43236	his	1142	“ Unsavory . I ’d rather not get into it . ”
43271	43275	43276	43276	He	1142	“ Unsavory how ? ”
43294	43302	43288	43288	I	0	“ Where is she ? Right now . ”
43303	43309	43236	43236	his	1142	“ I do n’t know . ”

43320	43342	43317	43317	I	0	“ The Hillman building . She has a quick route there , and then she ’s at the International Foods Center . ”
43343	43347	43348	43348	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
43608	43616	43617	43617	I	0	“ Max ! What are you doing ? ”

43639	43652	43653	43653	she	167	“ I do n’t think Antonio is really any of your business , ”
43656	43662	43663	43663	I	0	“ He ’s extremely dangerous , ”
43666	43682	43663	43663	I	0	“ Did you know that he sold his body in the gutters back in Italy ? ”
43687	43690	43683	43683	She	167	“ Huh ? ”
43691	43730	43731	43731	She	167	“ Antonio would plunge a knife into a man ’s heart as readily as he would slice a tomato . He ’s killed before , you know . I ’m thinking about alerting a friend on the force . ”
43735	43739	43731	43731	She	167	“ A cop ? ”
43740	43769	43772	43772	her	167	“ He bathes in the blood of his enemies . Though on the upside , tomato - slicing skills like that would make him handy around the kitchen . ”
43797	43808	43792	43792	She	167	“ Screw off . I ca n’t even with you . ”
43860	43868	43873	43873	her	167	“ And that kiss . So fake . ”
43876	43886	43873	43873	her	167	“ Who are you to say what ’s fake ? ”
43896	43910	43887	43887	I	0	“ I ’m the man who ’s going to kiss you for real . ”
43964	43972	43973	43973	she	167	“ You think you ’re all that , ”
43984	43993	43973	43973	she	167	“ You think that was a real kiss ? ”
44002	44011	43994	43994	I	0	“ I know it was a real kiss . ”
44022	44035	44012	44012	I	0	“ Try not to eat all of the cheesy puffs next time . ”
44110	44125	44126	44126	he	1178	“ I understand you ’ve been kissing Meow Squad cats out on the street , ”
44132	44139	44126	44126	he	1178	“ Leaving them stunned and breathless . ”
44181	44193	44194	44194	Tarquin	171	“ Kissing me is always a deeply religious experience for women . ”
44205	44209	44210	44210	he	1178	“ Come on , ”
44213	44226	44210	44210	he	1178	“ Level with me . A delivery girl now ? Do tell . ”
44248	44309	44210	44210	he	1178	“ Max Hilton with the lunch - cart girl ? Why not go all the way ? We could do Satanist Max Hilton , all animal sacrifices and strange tattoos . Or Max Hilton with an alien baby . Or maybe Max Hilton who sings weepy show tunes and still ca n’t get over that first love who rejected him . ”
44310	44318	44210	44210	he	1178	“ Gimme something real . Some interiority . ”
44319	44354	44366	44366	he	171	“ Tarquin , the side boob has come back in style , and the Verona Club has Delmonico steak back on the menu . Let ’s grab a window table and get day drunk . ”
44355	44365	44366	44366	he	171	“ You ’re not doing that to me again , ”
44372	44379	44369	44369	I	0	“ Fine . Questions . Anything . ”
44380	44384	44366	44366	he	171	“ Lana Sheffidy . ”

44398	44414	44415	44415	I	0	“ I ’d tell you if there was something going on . I promise you , ”
44421	44437	44415	44415	I	0	“ Though she ’s threatening to design a men ’s fanny pack line for Maximillion . ”
44441	44446	44447	44447	he	171	“ God , no , ”
44456	44471	44452	44452	he	171	“ You ran away from home at the age of eleven . What happened ? ”
44477	44487	44488	44488	He	171	“ Does n’t every kid run away from home ? ”
44493	44514	44488	44488	He	171	“ It was right after your elderly nanny , Annette O’Grady , died in a crash on the Queens Expressway . ”
44554	44561	44562	44562	I	0	“ It was a big loss , ”
44565	44588	44562	44562	I	0	“ Annette was a sweet , caring woman . She ’d been with us since I was a toddler and she was … ”
44632	44653	44626	44626	I	0	“ Annette was full of life . Missed by the whole family . She loved custard , as I recall . ”
44983	45017	44976	44976	She	124	“ I should give you the two hundred dollars extra I made yesterday from your idea to pimp out these stupid cat getups . But I need it for rent . Thank you . ”
45018	45030	45031	45031	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . It was n’t really my idea , ”
45038	45055	45031	45031	I	0	“ I adapted it from Max Hilton ’s playbook . You know , that pickup book ? ”
45056	45065	44976	44976	She	124	“ Seriously ? Why would you read that ? ”
45066	45079	45080	45080	I	0	“ I deliver to his tower . I wanted to be ready . ”
45091	45099	45100	45100	she	124	“ The playbook . Thanks , Hilton , ”
45103	45115	45100	45100	she	124	“ What else are you doing ? I want more tricks . ”
45121	45154	45116	45116	I	0	“ Here ’s another : Be playful and outrageous . You need to show you just do n’t give a shit . Like , give people funny nicknames and boss them around . ”
45155	45158	45080	45080	I	0	“ Seriously ? ”
45159	45218	45116	45116	I	0	“ Say , if there ’s any sports stuff in in their office , you call them that — like Bengals or Cubby if it ’s Cubs . A guy with a Blade Runner sticker on the outside of his laptop is Blade . Or if they order something unusual , like Shasta , you call them that . ”
45219	45230	45080	45080	I	0	“ You just say , here ya go , Shasta ? ”
45231	45238	45116	45116	I	0	“ Or Dr. Pepper . Whatever . ”
45239	45245	45246	45246	Sienna	124	“ I could do that , ”
45404	45411	45395	45395	Blade	157	“ What ’s up , Blade ? ”
45450	45466	45447	45447	He	97	“ I know this is last minute , but what are you doing Saturday night ? ”
45482	45489	45490	45490	he	97	“ It ’s the Maximillion party , ”
45493	45537	45538	45538	he	97	“ I want you to feel free to say no and know that I ’ll never ask you out again or be weird , and I do n’t want you to feel any pressure to say yes because I ’m a delivery client , ”
45541	45573	45538	45538	he	97	“ But before you answer , let me add that it ’s one of the hottest parties in town . Because of the scavenger hunt . Have you heard about it ? ”
45574	45582	45490	45490	he	97	“ I thought people hated scavenger hunts . ”
45583	45633	45538	45538	he	97	“ They do n’t hate them when there ’s actual treasure to be scavenged — like cruises and thousand - dollar bills . And there ’s a trivia component and you seem to know a lot of useless music trivia and I know sports . We could clean up . ”
45634	45645	45646	45646	He	97	“ What was that , mister ? Useless music trivia ? ”
45664	45668	45653	45653	he	97	“ Seemingly useless … ”
45669	45675	45676	45676	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
45696	45712	45653	45653	he	97	“ Think about it . Even as friends . Seriously . The prizes are insane . ”
45713	45720	45721	45721	I	0	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
46032	46035	46036	46036	I	0	“ Hey , ”

46297	46303	46304	46304	Parker	72	“ Now where were we ? ”
46313	46323	46304	46304	Parker	72	“ Lindsey , let ’s have the media schedule . ”

46514	46520	46509	46509	Her	80	“ Cheesy puffs were specified . ”
46521	46542	46543	46543	I	0	“ You were out of cheesy puffs the other day and I recall having something else that was really delicious , ”
46551	46579	46546	46546	She	80	“ That choice is no longer available to you , I ’m afraid . It ’ll have to be a fond memory . Never to be repeated . ”
46580	46583	46548	46548	her	80	“ No ? ”
46605	46609	46610	46610	She	80	“ So sorry . ”

46756	46763	46752	46752	she	80	“ It looks good to me . ”
46768	46780	46752	46752	she	80	“ I would go so far as to call it impressive . ”
46781	46789	46790	46790	She	80	“ No , there ’s something missing . ”
46797	46806	46790	46790	She	80	“ Wait , I know what ’s missing . ”

47150	47165	47146	47146	Her	80	“ You think you ’re all that . What with the models . Please . ”
47172	47182	47146	47146	Her	80	“ And you think you can punch my sandwich ? ”
47183	47186	47187	47187	she	80	“ Yes , ”
47190	47199	47187	47187	she	80	“ I think I can punch your sandwich . ”
47214	47223	47206	47206	I	0	“ Do you have an apology for me ? ”
47224	47227	47228	47228	she	80	“ No , ”

61313	61320	61321	61321	he	1526	“ I usually go low key , ”
61324	61330	61321	61321	he	1526	“ But I feel celebrational . ”
61354	61362	61349	61349	He	1526	“ Parker apologizes , by the way . ”
61363	61373	61376	61376	his	1526	“ So he thought it would be … funny ? ”
61379	61397	61376	61376	his	1526	“ I do n’t know . It was messed up , and he should ’ve told me . ”
61398	61428	61429	61429	Max	72	“ I ca n’t believe you guys stayed friends all these years . I bet he ’s a good business partner — he always was kind of an operator . ”
61434	61444	61429	61429	Max	72	“ He still is . You have no idea . ”
61445	61485	61376	61376	his	1526	“ Remember when he was always starting those wacky businesses he ’d try to get everyone involved in ? The dance mob birthday business . Or that guerilla serenading YouTube channel ? Getting kids to serenade jaywalkers and things ? ”
61486	61504	61505	61505	We	1527	“ He almost got hit a few times off that . He ’s lucky he did n’t . ”
61530	61533	61534	61534	he	72	“ Right ? ”
61537	61555	61534	61534	he	72	“ They ’re almost as good as a pork roll sandwich from Mort ’s Diner back home . ”
61556	61559	61560	61560	His	72	“ Mia . ”
61565	61574	61560	61560	His	72	“ What ? Have you ever tasted one ? ”
61575	61597	61534	61534	he	72	“ Are you talking about that fried ham stuff that you get in a can ? Tell me you ’re not . ”
61598	61621	61534	61534	he	72	“ Taylor ham , and it ’s amazing . Though these little cucumber things ? Giving the pork roll a definite run . ”
61762	61798	61749	61749	He	72	“ Why ’d you quit , Max ? With the music ? Not that you have n’t done obnoxiously well for yourself and all . But you were so good and you left it behind . ”
61799	61809	61874	61874	he	72	“ You said I attacked the keyboard like Terminator . ”
61810	61818	61819	61819	He	72	“ That ’s not answering the question . ”
61832	61839	61819	61819	He	72	“ It was n’t for me . ”
61840	61860	61868	61868	he	72	“ You had to get to the most elite level of musicianship to realize music was n’t for you ? ”
61877	61885	61874	61874	he	72	“ I always knew I hated it . ”
61916	61921	61922	61922	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
61927	61932	61922	61922	I	0	“ You hated it ? ”
61933	61936	61874	61874	he	72	“ Ferociously . ”
61937	61948	61922	61922	I	0	“ Something that you did like eight hours a day . ”
61949	61962	61963	61963	he	72	“ You ’re supposed to be miserable in high school , right ? ”
61966	61973	61963	61963	he	72	“ Is n’t that a rule ? ”
61974	61996	61922	61922	I	0	“ I kind of ca n’t get over it . You were in a performing arts school and you hated performing . ”
61997	62002	61963	61963	he	72	“ Not all performing . ”
62019	62025	62005	62005	I	0	“ You liked Oklahoma ! . ”
62026	62077	61922	61922	I	0	“ I loved it . That summer … I’d always loved that music . I mean , I never had the chops for doing it professionally , but I loved it . Maybe that ’s part of why I loved it . And then for them to put us together . ”
62078	62107	61922	61922	I	0	“ Why did n’t you just go over to the theater side ? Max , you were having fun up there . They probably would ’ve let you . ”
62108	62166	62005	62005	I	0	“ My folks would ’ve pulled me out of that school so fast . You do n’t know . I could ’ve been snorting coke and making bombs , and they would n’t have pulled me out as long as I was performing at an elite lever , but show tunes ? The seventh ring of hell . ”
62167	62178	61922	61922	I	0	“ It ’s pretty far from Mozart , I guess . ”
62179	62188	62189	62189	He	1530	“ Classical music is the Miller family business . ”
62205	62233	62189	62189	He	1530	“ If I ’m honest , I liked what came with the child prodigy status . It was an instant place on top of the food chain . ”
62234	62240	62241	62241	I	0	“ Like being star quarterback , ”
62244	62257	62241	62241	I	0	“ You get all the popularity for being good at some game . ”
62281	62309	62276	62277	the group	515	“ See that ? They usually wo n’t talk to you if you have food in front of you . Unless they ’re complete assholes . FYI . ”
62310	62315	62316	62316	He	1530	“ You played angry . ”
62323	62347	62316	62316	He	1530	“ Yes , and like a robot . Without feeling . Terminator , you said . You heard it and you were right . ”
62348	62358	62276	62277	the group	515	“ I did n’t say that to be cruel . ”
62359	62387	62316	62316	He	1530	“ This might sound a little strange , but it meant something that you saw it . You saw me . It made me feel less alone . ”
62463	62474	62475	62475	she	80	“ Nice elevator . There ’s just one thing missing , ”
62478	62484	62475	62475	she	80	“ What could be missing ? ”
62515	62521	62522	62522	she	80	“ What could it be ? ”
62593	62601	62590	62590	She	80	“ So this is where you live . ”
62602	62610	62590	62590	She	80	“ When I ’m in the city . ”
62611	62617	62624	62624	her	80	“ Ah , of course . ”
62662	62670	62671	62671	she	80	“ Where are the giant freak lips ? ”
62718	62737	62703	62704	My designer	1543	“ Somebody is obsessed with me . Did you collect all of the articles ever written about me ? ”
62738	62743	62744	62744	she	80	“ You ’re inescapable , ”
62747	62764	62744	62744	she	80	“ You ’re even on the sides of the busses ? Somebody loves his own face . ”
62793	62802	62783	62783	I	0	“ I think you love my own face . ”
62903	62921	62922	62922	She	80	“ This is n’t at all what was in the magazine . It ’s so much more … ”
62991	62997	62998	62998	she	80	“ It ’s so you , ”
63001	63005	62998	62998	she	80	“ A crow ? ”
63006	63042	63071	63071	she	80	“ It ’s so straightforward , just the lines of it . Energetic and watchful . People think crows are carnivorous and mercenary , but in truth , they ’re fun and smart and playful . ”
63043	63055	63056	63056	She	80	“ Are you saying people think I ’m carnivorous and mercenary ? ”
63062	63065	63056	63056	She	80	“ Maybe . ”
63125	63142	63117	63117	She	80	“ It looked so different in the Architectural Digest article . This is much more human . ”
63143	63154	63155	63155	She	80	“ I ’m still on the carnivorous and mercenary thing . ”
63188	63201	63202	63202	She	80	“ Look , Max , there ’s steam coming out of there . ”
63215	63224	63202	63202	She	80	“ Is that thing functional in the wintertime ? ”
63225	63228	63202	63202	She	80	“ Maybe . ”
63229	63235	63202	63202	She	80	“ That is so decadent . ”
63236	63246	63247	63247	She	80	“ Decadence is the spice of life , baby . ”
63290	63304	63282	63282	I	0	“ It ’s amazing in the winter . You want to go in ? ”
63305	63311	63282	63282	I	0	“ Would we need suits ? ”
63312	63323	63324	63324	She	80	“ I have a no - suit policy for you . ”
63331	63335	63324	63324	She	80	“ Oh really ? ”
63336	63359	63360	63360	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , but it ’s a strict no - suit policy that I enforce in only the harshest way . ”
63378	63389	63360	63360	I	0	“ I ’m afraid I ’ll have to enforce it . ”
63453	63457	63458	63458	I	0	“ Bra off , ”
63489	63493	63479	63479	I	0	“ So beautiful . ”
63552	63566	63567	63567	I	0	“ No , no , no , no . Keep the shoes on , ”
63570	63579	63567	63567	I	0	“ I ca n’t wear shoes in there . ”
63611	63625	63608	63608	I	0	“ Bad news . We ’re not gon na make it that far . ”
63639	63647	63648	63648	I	0	“ You ’re so wet for me , ”
63651	63675	63648	63648	I	0	“ I love how you get wet for me so fast . Almost as fast as I get hard for you . Almost . ”
63693	63724	63676	63676	I	0	“ See that table over there ? I ’m going to bend you over that table , and you ’re going to let me do what I need to do . ”
63741	63744	63738	63738	her	80	“ Yeah ? ”
63750	63764	63745	63745	I	0	“ You want me to describe how I ’m going to fuck you ? ”
63765	63770	63771	63771	She	80	“ Yeah , Hilton . ”
63779	63785	63771	63771	She	80	“ I want the details . ”
63815	63862	63863	63863	I	0	“ I ’m going to hold your hair in my fist and press you right onto that table . It ’s cool marble , but you ’ll warm it up with your sweaty little body , because I ’m going to be working you so hard . ”
63885	63935	63863	63863	I	0	“ I ’m not just gon na fuck you . I know from last night you like a little something extra over your clit , and it ’s the perfect position for that . I ’m going to make you come so hard you ’ll forget how to meow . ”
63936	63943	63944	63944	she	80	“ That ’s a tall order , ”
64022	64026	64027	64027	I	0	“ Undo me , ”
64075	64079	64080	64080	I	0	“ So good , ”
64083	64142	64080	64080	I	0	“ That ’s how hard I am for you . I ’ll get even harder once I ’m inside that pussy of yours . I ’m gon na make you come so hard , your knees might give out . But I ’ll hold you . I need you upright for how I ’m gon na do you . ”
64183	64187	64188	64188	I	0	“ This pussy , ”
64222	64228	64213	64213	I	0	“ I gotcha , baby . ”
64286	64297	64298	64298	I	0	“ Well - fucked is a good look on you , ”
64346	64357	64358	64358	she	80	“ You ’re just saying that because I ’m naked , ”
64361	64366	64358	64358	she	80	“ So not true . ”
64400	64412	64385	64385	She	80	“ I ’ll never get sick of watching you enjoy things . ”
64413	64430	64431	64431	I	0	“ That works because I ’ll never get sick of enjoying things . Especially you things . ”
64439	64445	64446	64446	she	80	“ You are spoiling me , ”
64449	64455	64446	64446	she	80	“ You are ruining me … ”
64456	64466	64385	64385	She	80	“ For other guys ? That ’s the plan . ”
64485	64497	64498	64498	She	80	“ Have I modulated my mercenary carnivorous image with you yet ? ”
64520	64543	64512	64512	she	80	“ We ’re actually working on it . Not to change the Max Hilton persona , but adding a corporate responsibility dimension . ”
64544	64557	64500	64500	her	80	“ I ’m not talking about dimensions of your persona , exactly . ”
64563	64566	64500	64500	her	80	“ What ? ”
64567	64577	64500	64500	her	80	“ Well , the book . The pickup book . ”
64578	64600	64601	64601	I	0	“ What ? The book ? It ’s ancient history . I do n’t think anybody even reads that book anymore . ”
64608	64635	64601	64601	I	0	“ Oh , people read the book . People take it to heart . It ’s not good . It teaches guys how to be jerks . ”
64654	64665	64648	64648	I	0	“ It ’s designed to help awkward men have confidence . ”
64666	64700	64701	64701	I	0	“ I do n’t know if it does that , but it definitely teaches guys who are stupid jerks how to be smart jerks . And they go out and screw with women . ”
64719	64726	64716	64716	I	0	“ Did somebody mess with you ? ”
64727	64780	64648	64648	I	0	“ Not with me , but my roommate Kelsey ? Her boyfriend picked her up with your techniques . And they ended up living together and it turned out that the entire time , he was using your techniques to pick up a zillion other girls . While they were living together . ”
64781	64797	64648	64648	I	0	“ That is awful . It ’s an awful thing to discover something like that . ”
64798	64803	64716	64716	I	0	“ She was devastated . ”
64827	64849	64812	64812	I	0	“ I have to say , though , he sounds like he would ’ve been a bad boyfriend without the book . ”
64850	64898	64899	64899	I	0	“ Yeah , but you helped him seem like a good boyfriend . And my friend , Jada ? She went to bed with a guy who did the jungle kissing move and it was like , false advertising . Those are two women I personally know . ”
64904	64913	64899	64899	I	0	“ Are you holding me responsible for that ? ”
64914	64931	64812	64812	I	0	“ Well , yeah . It teaches guys how to be jerky . The book sucks . ”
64932	64935	64936	64936	I	0	“ Ouch , ”
64939	64953	64936	64936	I	0	“ I know you wrote it when you were twenty , but seriously ? ”
64954	64957	64958	64958	I	0	“ Look , ”
64961	64984	64958	64958	I	0	“ if you went and got coaching on how to say the right thing in a job interview , is that wrong ? ”
64985	65015	64936	64936	I	0	“ It would be wrong if the coach told me to pretend I was something I was n’t . And meeting in a bar is n’t a job interview . ”
65016	65028	65029	65029	I	0	“ Meeting in a bar is exactly like a job interview , ”
65032	65056	65029	65029	I	0	“ And the company who hires you would be responsible for confirming what you told them . Maybe giving you a probation period . ”
65069	65091	65060	65060	her	1566	“ The book was designed to inspire guys to have confidence . To be unique , let their personalities shine through . ”
65130	65144	65120	65120	She	1566	“ You helped them pretend they have a personality that is n’t theirs . ”
65145	65150	65151	65151	I	0	“ It ’s coaching , ”
65154	65185	65151	65151	I	0	“ Really ? What do you call the thing where you ’re supposed to completely ignore the pretty girl and talk with everybody else ? Emotional manipulation . Come on . ”
65186	65224	65120	65120	She	1566	“ All performance is emotional manipulation . At the Shiz they talked all the time how to wring emotion out of music . Method acting is emotional manipulation . The key of D minor is emotional manipulation . ”
65225	65230	65231	65231	she	1566	“ It ’s different , ”
65234	65265	65231	65231	she	1566	“ And the men are only supposed to choose girls they will never feel attached to , so that they ca n’t get hurt . What the hell is that ? ”
65289	65298	65299	65299	I	0	“ I was definitely cynical about … romance , ”
65326	65335	65314	65314	I	0	“ Does Kelsey have a problem with me ? ”
65336	65359	65306	65306	she	1566	“ A lot of my friends do . I ’m honestly surprised you ’re surprised . Like you never get any blowback ? ”
65360	65378	65306	65306	she	1566	“ I ’ve never pay attention to my critics . You ca n’t get anywhere like that . ”
65379	65416	65314	65314	I	0	“ So basically , everybody you deal with is in awe of you . You ’re surrounded by fans and yes - people and employees . Even in high school people were in awe of you . ”
65417	65421	65422	65422	I	0	“ Not everyone , ”
65425	65459	65422	65422	I	0	“ Be serious . You ’ve never had to deal with people who ’d rather give your picture a magic marker moustache than wear Maximillion logo shit , but they ’re out there . ”
65460	65467	65468	65468	I	0	“ I do n’t doubt it , ”
65525	65555	65515	65515	I	0	“ Let me look into it . If I feel like there ’s a problem , I ’ll make donation to something . The Harriet Tubman shelter , or … ”
65556	65582	65583	65583	I	0	“ You ca n’t just throw money at it , Max . This is n’t PR . This is real people in the real world . ”
65607	65621	65602	65602	She	1572	“ You better not be thinking of a Max Hilton line right now . ”
65622	65627	65604	65604	her	1572	“ I ’m not . ”
65628	65657	65604	65604	her	1572	“ Who needs the real world when there ’s hundred - year - old scotch ? Or some shit like that ? Is that what you were thinking . ”
65658	65676	65677	65677	I	0	“ Oh , baby , you got ta do better than that for a Max Hilton line , ”
65794	65803	65804	65804	she	1572	“ How do you know all of this ? ”
65811	65829	65804	65804	she	1572	“ I knew your family was musical , but god . I thought it was only classical . ”
65830	65840	65841	65841	She	1572	“ It ’s not my family . Not exactly . ”
65934	66020	66021	66021	Mia	80	“ I did n’t have any electronics or playmates or anything . It was just the music . But Annette brought those songs . She had dyed blond hair and huge rings on her wrinkly hands and an actual record player in her room . And when my parents went on trips , she ’d bring it down the living room and we ’d sing and laugh . I suppose it gave her deniability . She could always report that we were working on music . ”
66138	66150	66151	66151	she	173	“ It was your escape , but you still hated it , ”
66163	66184	66156	66156	I	0	“ And then you were in Oklahoma ! with me . I assumed it was like a punishment to you . ”
66185	66196	66197	66197	I	0	“ It was the best thing that could ’ve happened , ”
66200	66206	66207	66207	she	173	“ For me , too , ”
66210	66214	66215	66215	I	0	“ That summer , ”
66240	66247	66237	66238	Insecure teens	1587	“ Do you see your parents ? ”
66248	66258	66268	66268	she	173	“ Not much . They ’re in France now . ”
66259	66267	66268	66268	she	173	“ I ’m so sorry about Annette , ”
66274	66285	66286	66286	she	173	“ I hate that you were made to hate music , ”
66289	66304	66305	66305	I	0	“ Not this music . It represents everything good . Your turn to pick , ”
66308	66312	66305	66305	I	0	“ Go ahead . ”
66358	66367	66368	66368	I	0	“ We need to go to Calle Corrientes , ”

I ’d forgotten how well he can sight read , just a few stops and starts to get it in his bones and he ’s on his way , making it his own . His phrasing is everything . Like he ’s discovering the heart of the song . He could always do that . He goes to the top , giving me my way in . My chest feels light — I’m not sure if it ’s fear or excitement . We ’re doing music together . I want to jump in , but something stops me . “
69417	69775	69413	69413	Train	1628	” he says , repeating the prelude , a musical question he knows I have to answer . We ’re two pieces of a puzzle . We always were . He goes back to the top . I watch his face . He glances at me and groans and starts again . It ’s a leap what I ’m about to do — more intimate than fucking him . He knows it . He ’s pulling me . I stand . I launch in . The first verse lyrical and sad — the whole song is . I sing it like I ’ve been practicing . It was good how I did it , and then I look at him and his eyes are sparkling . Shivers go over me because he ’s right in there with me . He comes back at me with the next verse . Max makes it seem easy . Max has a distinct piano voice , but he knows how to use it to support my voice . We sang together that summer and he knows how to make me shine . The perfect tone to enrich mine . We head into the song , like heading into the wilderness together . And then everything falls away , and it ’s just us , meeting in the music . The song is heartbreaking , and toward the middle it soars operatically . When we come to the end , he moves his finger in a circle to show he ’s circling back to the beginning . I head in again and we ’re off . Flying again . Back in that magical summer , but so much better . He pauses when I falter , returning to just the right point to get me back . We go again and again and then back around to the front . Like if we never stop the song , this does n’t have to end . It ’s so beautiful and right that at one point this wave of grief washes over me . All the years of being stupid . He stops . “

He ’s the opposite of the Max Hilton that ’s offered for public consumption . He ’s the old Max . Genuine . In my corner . I try the new thing . He goes back again and again . I feel like we could play forever . I want the shine of our music to push away reality . But finally I have to stop or I ’ll burn out my vocal chords . He looks over at me . Smiles . Not his Max Hilton smile , but his goofy smile . “

71166	71173	71163	71163	Jada	113	“ How Kelsey lived with one ? ”
71179	71193	71163	71163	Jada	113	“ I do n’t know if I feel like spooling it all out . ”
71267	71282	71283	71283	He	97	“ He seemed so funny and unique , but it was all your lines ! ”
71302	71313	71283	71283	He	97	“ I didn’t … think it through from that angle . ”
71314	71321	71322	71322	Jada	113	“ It ’s not an angle , ”
71325	71367	71368	71368	She	80	“ It ’s a freaking ruse . I specifically gave a guy the benefit of the doubt because of that cute dog story and it was n’t real . I felt deceived , and I feel like your book encourages that . ”
71408	71420	71421	71421	he	97	“ It was a bit much to suggest they memorize it , ”
71425	71434	71421	71421	he	97	“ They should have their own unique thing . ”
71435	71443	71444	71444	Jada	113	“ Yeah , that ’s a start . ”
71453	71466	71467	71467	he	97	“ I did n’t mean for it to be used that way , ”
71470	71475	71467	71467	he	97	“ I ’m sorry . ”
71476	71483	71484	71484	Kelsey	80	“ Thank you for saying that , ”

71530	71577	71527	71527	Max	97	“ And I think sorry is n’t enough . I ’m thinking about doing a new edition . I talked to my publisher and they ’ll go for it if I write it . I can encourage guys to be confident and interesting without being fake . ”
71578	71588	71589	71589	Jada	113	“ You ’re thinking about doing a new edition ? ”
71697	71706	71707	71707	he	97	“ There ’s something you ’re not saying , ”
71722	71877	71710	71710	Kelsey	80	“ It ’s not just about my experience ; in fact that ’s the least of it . Because I ’ll own right now that I had a part in what happened with Nathan — your book helped get him in the door , but it was on me to see him for what he was . To not be blinded by his looks . But here ’s the thing — I got burned by a guy who read your book . He only read it . You wrote it . You put down every single one of those words . How can I trust you to be good to Mia when this is the way you were directing guys to behave ? People change , but do they really ? Or do they just get better at hiding shit ? So if you think I ’m not saying something … that ’s it . ”
71878	71885	71886	71886	I	0	“ He ’s not that guy , ”

72060	72069	72070	72070	Lizzie	76	“ I ’m curious about your pickup system , ”
72080	72118	72070	72070	Lizzie	76	“ How did you develop it ? How did you know what would work ? You were twenty years old without much experience dating from the sound of it . Was there some sort of testing protocol ? ”
72167	72182	72183	72183	he	97	“ I was … on the other end of it , in a way , ”
72186	72190	72183	72183	he	97	“ The system ? ”
72195	72201	72191	72191	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
72205	72214	72202	72202	Kelsey	80	“ A woman did a system on you ? ”
72215	72241	72242	72242	I	0	“ It was n’t a system , not anything anybody was consciously doing . It was just … observing the effect of her on me . ”
72270	72279	72280	72280	I	0	“ I ’ve had enough of this topic , ”

72310	72317	72318	72318	Max	97	“ She was playful and outrageous , ”
72321	72336	72318	72318	Max	97	“ A little bit bossy . And so goddamn beautiful , it killed me . ”
72370	72378	72379	72379	Max	97	“ She was a force of nature , ”
72382	72420	72379	72379	Max	97	“ And the outrageous things she ’d do . With every little thing she did , I ’d just want her more . She dressed so brightly when I first met her . Loud colors and metallics . ”
72426	72432	72421	72421	Kelsey	80	“ The alpha - signaling . ”
72439	72442	72443	72443	Max	97	“ Yup , ”
72446	72456	72443	72443	Max	97	“ Like she was anointing herself . Choosing herself . ”
72473	72486	72487	72487	he	97	“ She was the bravest , boldest woman I ’d ever met , ”
72490	72540	72487	72487	he	97	“ She came up poor ; she was n’t supposed to even leave her tiny town , but she set her sights high , believed in herself when nobody else would . She ’d literally bulldoze you with her reality . And god , the stories she would tell ! ”
72548	72554	72487	72487	he	97	“ What are you doing ? ”
72555	72619	72487	72487	he	97	“ We started out enemies , but one summer we did this musical together , and it was the best summer of my life . But I screwed it up , and we were enemies again . Even so , I ’d sneak into Miedlow Hall and listen to her sing . I could n’t stay away from her . I loved her . ”

72650	72673	72637	72637	I	0	“ When I left high school , I was sure I ’d lost my chance at love . I wrote the book . ”

72755	72760	72752	72752	Kelsey	80	“ It was Mia . ”
72768	72811	72761	72761	Antonio	119	“ He wrote it because he could n’t have Mia . His heart was broken in pieces . So he goes off to warn other men . Never pursue a woman you ca n’t walk away from . Never fall in love . ”
72812	72815	72816	72816	I	0	“ Max , ”
72827	72870	72820	72820	Max	97	“ I just love you , that ’s all . I ’m not saying that so you say it back . In fact , I do n’t want that right now , but Lizzie asked how I came up with the system . ”

73015	73020	73021	73021	she	80	“ Okay , okay , ”
73024	73028	73021	73021	she	80	“ That works . ”
73306	73314	73296	73296	Max	97	“ So this is where you live . ”

73525	73530	73522	73522	Kelsey	80	“ A stupid joke . ”
73531	73541	73542	73542	He	97	“ Does n’t look like a joke to me . ”
73583	73597	73600	73600	he	97	“ I was wondering how you all knew so much about the book . ”
73607	73612	73613	73613	Lizzie	76	“ I did that . ”
73616	73622	73613	73613	Lizzie	76	“ That was all me . ”

73752	73774	73746	73746	he	97	“ Stop staring at those stupid things ! It was before I realized how I felt about you , before I — ”
73775	73782	73783	73783	he	97	“ Yet you kept them up , ”
73791	73799	73783	73783	he	97	“ Look at all the X ’s . ”

73835	73850	73824	73824	he	97	“ Then again , you brought me to my knees , did n’t you ? ”
73851	73894	73895	73895	He	97	“ It was a dumb thing . From when I thought you arranged the visits . Please , listen to me ! I freaked out when I saw you on my roster . I was scared . Look at me , Max ! ”

74495	74533	74492	74492	Parker	72	“ It ’s partly my fault . I should n’t have gotten involved . I just always thought you two belonged together . You were enemies for so long , but nobody got him going like you . ”

75061	75094	75058	75058	she	80	“ You look at his pictures . It ’s like nothing matters . But after what he confessed at The Wilder Club , it ’s really the opposite , is n’t it ? ”
75111	75126	75127	75127	I	0	“ He did n’t create the Max Hilton persona because nothing matters to him , ”
75131	75140	75127	75127	I	0	“ It ’s because things matter too much . ”

76031	76066	75990	75990	his	72	“ I do n’t know . How long does a person sleep with somebody , and at home she has his picture full of darts ? And a wall - sized chart plotting vengeance ? ”
76067	76111	76112	76112	He	72	“ Dude , you ’re talking to a guy who had a picture of Britney Spears wearing a snake on his wall well into his twenties . And it stopped being sexy when I was fifteen . People leave shit on their walls . ”

76189	76271	76184	76184	He	72	“ It was n’t just the fact of the picture and the chart , though that was bad enough . It was the shock of it after what I ’d told the group of them . I mean , I ’d just spilled my guts , right in front of her friends . About fucking pining over her . Loving her from afar . I laid it all out on the table — things I ’d never told a living soul . ”

Right there in front of Mia and four complete strangers . But in a strange way , it felt good to bare my soul to them . I wanted them to see how I felt . And then the next thing I know , my face is covered in darts . Like I ’m Satan over there . ”
