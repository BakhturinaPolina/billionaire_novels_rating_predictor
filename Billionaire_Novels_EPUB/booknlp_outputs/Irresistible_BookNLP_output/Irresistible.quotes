5450	5543	5563	5563	She	276	“ Listen , I do n’t have a business card on me right now , but when I get back from Hawaii , I ’m going to send one over to you .

9516	9539	9513	9513	Chloe	64	“ If we had a distillery on site , I ’d have some for you . Are you having a bad morning ? ”
9540	9568	9375	9375	He	426	“ Kind of . My sitter is out of commission and I need to find a replacement before Winifred gets out of preschool at eleven - thirty . ”
9569	9577	9513	9513	Chloe	64	“ Just have Frannie pick her up . ”

9968	10012	9964	9964	I	0	“ I was trying to think of someone else who could help , but not having much luck . I could even run and pick her up and bring her back here so you do n’t have to leave the desk too early . ”
10013	10047	9946	9946	She	47	“ That ’s perfect . I ’ll get her some lunch here , and then we ’ll head back to your house in time to be there when Millie and Felicity get home . ”

10953	10962	10941	10941	She	51	“ No . Is this where you live ? ”
10963	10971	10972	10972	She	51	“ Yes . Do you like it ? ”
10975	10983	10972	10972	She	51	“ It ’s like a doll house . ”
10987	11011	10984	10984	I	0	“ It is kind of like a doll house . A little bigger , maybe , but not much . Are you hungry ? “

11027	11207	11016	11016	Me	0	” In the kitchen , Winnie and I opened my fridge and took out a big container of chicken noodle soup I ’d made over the weekend . In my tiny pantry , she found some Ritz crackers , and counted out four for each of us while I rinsed and sliced an apple . When everything was ready , we sat at the counter next to each other . While we ate , I asked Winnie about school , about her sisters , and as usual , I snuck in a question or two about her dad . That was how I ’d learned that he was n’t a very good cook and they were used to eating a lot of chicken nuggets and fish sticks for dinner , that he never got mad when Winnie wet the bed , and that he was okay at brushing hair but terrible at styling it . Today I learned that over the weekend , he ’d accidentally turned everyone ’s white socks pink , even his own . I laughed . “

11231	11246	11016	11016	Me	0	” After lunch , I asked Winnie if she ’d ever had a macaron . “
11251	11275	11016	11016	Me	0	” she asked , wiping her mouth on her sleeve . I gasped in mock horror as I stood , collecting our bowls . “

11320	11367	11280	11280	You	0	” I carried our dishes to the sink and grabbed the bakery box sitting on the counter . Inside were a few macarons I ’d set aside Saturday when preparing for the Radley wedding . I had hazelnut , white chocolate malt , and rosewater cream . “

11533	11596	11600	11600	you	0	” I took a tiny bite of the white chocolate malt , thinking again about what Mrs. Radley had said to me Saturday night about my own business . Since then , her offer to discuss the possibility had crossed my mind a hundred times . I hoped she ’d get in touch . Winnie gobbled hers up and licked her fingers . “

11745	11895	11715	11715	I	0	” A few minutes later , she was snuggled up in my white faux fur blanket , her eyes drifting shut almost immediately . I sat at the other end of the couch with my phone and posted a few things on Cloverleigh ’s social media — a graphic on Facebook advertising an upcoming wine dinner that Chloe and Henry DeSantis had organized , a photo on Instagram I ’d snapped of the macarons on the dessert table at the weekend ’s wedding , and a tweet congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Radley along with a picture from their ceremony . Finally , I returned direct messages from a few brides , answering their questions if I could , and forwarding April ’s information if they ’d requested specifics on availability or pricing . I was just finishing up when I got a text from Mack . How ’s it going ?

13052	13079	13012	13012	her	236	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . Running a business would be much too hard and stressful for you . You do n’t know anything about it . ”

13207	13255	13256	13256	She	489	“ It ’s the truth , Mom . I wanted to do all the things my sisters did , but the answer was always no . Play sports . Go away to college . Backpack through Europe . I ’ve never even been out of the country ! ”
13273	13301	13270	13270	her	489	“ You ca n’t compare yourself to your sisters . You were different , Frannie . Special . There were limits to what your heart could handle . ”

13997	14018	14019	14019	she	51	“ Macarons , not macaroni . Not that those are very healthy . Those were the cookies in your lunch , ”

14031	14059	13991	13991	her	47	“ Yeah . I kept looking for more in the bag . I ’m not a huge dessert person but those were delicious . Not overly sweet . ”
14060	14076	14077	14077	she	51	“ If they ’re done right , they should n’t be too sweet . And , ”
14083	14090	14077	14077	she	51	“ they ’re gluten - free . ”
14091	14108	14109	14109	I	0	“ Thanks . Hey , how did you get to be so good in the kitchen ? ”
14119	14164	14116	14116	She	51	“ I spent a lot of time at home with my mom growing up . She always made sure I ate really healthy because of — well , just because . And winters are long up here . Cooking and baking filled the time . ”
14165	14172	14173	14173	I	0	“ Winters are long up here . ”
14198	14214	14173	14173	I	0	“ You better get moving . The driving is n’t going to get any better . ”
14215	14229	14230	14230	she	51	“ Do you know how much snow we ’re going to get tonight ? ”
14233	14241	14230	14230	she	51	“ I heard eight to ten inches . ”
14262	14292	14258	14258	I	0	“ I think that ’s about right , but it ’s not supposed to start really coming down until five or six . You okay to drive in this ? ”
14293	14316	14258	14258	I	0	“ Oh , yeah . I ’m fine . My dad gave all of us extensive lessons in driving in the snow . ”
14317	14321	14347	14347	He	79	“ True story , ”
14363	14366	14367	14367	she	444	“ Dad , ”
14375	14379	14367	14367	she	444	“ Let go . ”
14380	14383	14384	14384	He	79	“ Never . ”
14396	14406	14384	14384	He	79	“ Got time to go over a few things ? ”
14422	14436	14407	14407	I	0	“ Yep . Be good , Winn . I ’ll see you later . ”
14443	14458	14440	14440	I	0	“ Your daughter has rescued me by agreeing to watch my kids this afternoon . ”
14459	14466	14468	14468	Sawyer	47	“ She ’s a good egg , ”
14474	14489	14468	14468	Sawyer	47	“ Thanks , Dad . Now let me go before I choke to death . ”
14497	14523	14490	14490	Sawyer	47	“ You be careful out there . And call me if you do n’t want to drive home later . I ’ll come get you . ”
14524	14531	14532	14532	I	0	“ I can bring her back , ”
14535	14556	14532	14532	I	0	“ Millie ’s old enough to stay with the younger two , or I can toss them in the car . ”
14600	14608	14575	14575	He	502	“ And how are you , peanut ? ”
14609	14612	14575	14575	He	502	“ Good . ”
14613	14618	14575	14575	He	502	“ No school today ? ”
14619	14624	14625	14625	she	51	“ I already went , ”
14629	14650	14651	14651	I	0	“ Ah . Well , if it keeps snowing like this , maybe you wo n’t have to go tomorrow . ”
14654	14670	14651	14651	I	0	“ Do n’t jinx us , Sawyer . I ’ve got work to do tomorrow . ”
14671	14688	14690	14690	Frannie	47	“ I can always watch them here if they want to come into work with you , ”
14692	14700	14701	14701	I	0	“ Do n’t you have to work ? ”
14704	14711	14712	14712	she	51	“ My parents own the place , ”
14724	14756	14712	14712	she	51	“ I do n’t think they ’d fire me for taking a day off . And maybe we could take the sleigh out again , Winnie . Would you like that ? ”
14757	14760	14761	14761	Winifred	51	“ Yes ! ”
14764	14780	14781	14781	Sawyer	47	“ What we should do is put up a sign selling rides on that thing , ”
14784	14794	14781	14781	Sawyer	47	“ We could probably make a fortune this week . ”
14795	14798	14799	14799	Frannie	47	“ Dad ! ”
14803	14826	14799	14799	Frannie	47	“ The idea was just to have the sleigh for the guests to ride for fun . And to use for weddings . ”
14827	14837	14838	14838	She	51	“ Fun has a price , does n’t it ? ”
14846	14859	14840	14840	her	51	“ It ’s not all about the money , Dad . Jeez . ”
14869	14916	14917	14917	I	0	“ My daughters are going to break me , Mack . If it ’s not April with her heated wedding barn , it ’s Chloe with her distillery , or Frannie giving everything away for free . And those are just the three that live here ! ”
14920	14949	14917	14917	I	0	“ Frannie ’s got a soft heart . But I hear you — my daughters are going to break me as well . Probably with the swear jar . ”
14961	14976	14952	14952	her	47	“ Come on , Winnie . We do n’t have to take this abuse . ”
14977	14980	14981	14981	I	0	“ Bye , ”
14991	14995	14997	14997	her	47	“ Thank you ! ”
15494	15503	15504	15504	Woods	54	“ I thought you were dead , asshole . ”
15507	15513	15504	15504	Woods	54	“ Nah . Just busy . ”
15514	15527	15477	15478	Ryan Woods	54	“ I bet . How ’s everything going with the wedding plans ? ”
15528	15540	15504	15504	Woods	54	“ Pretty good . Although what the fuck do I know ? ”
15541	15549	15504	15504	Woods	54	“ You ready to do this thing ? ”
15550	15558	15559	15559	I	0	“ Yeah . That , I know . ”
15562	15565	15559	15559	I	0	“ Good . ”
15738	15746	15747	15747	I	0	“ So when are you coming up ? ”
15750	15763	15747	15747	I	0	“ Am I supposed to be planning some kind of bachelor night ? ”
15764	15767	15768	15768	he	54	“ No , ”
15772	15831	15768	15768	he	54	“ Neither Stella nor I want anything like that . I ’d settle for a few beers somewhere . We ’re coming up on the Wednesday before the wedding , and Thursday is the day Stella and her sisters are doing some kind of all - day girl thing , so maybe we can hang out that night . ”
15832	15835	15836	15836	I	0	“ Done , ”
15839	15865	15836	15836	I	0	“ My parents get in that day , and God knows I ’ll need to escape the house . I ’m looking forward to it . ”
15866	15870	15871	15871	He	54	“ Me too . ”
15876	15899	15873	15873	his	54	“ All this wedding shit is driving me crazy . I ’m trying to be interested and involved , but Jesus fuck . ”
15903	15908	15873	15873	his	54	“ I can imagine . ”
15909	15967	15873	15873	his	54	“ And the cost — my God , we want to pay for everything ourselves , but I had no idea how expensive things are . And her sister Emme , who ’s a wedding planner , has talked her into all these extras . It ’s insanity . Stella has lost her mind , I swear . ”
15968	15984	15985	15985	He	531	“ Well , we knew that . She ’s marrying you , is n’t she ? ”
15988	15992	15985	15985	He	531	“ Fuck off . ”
15993	16008	16009	16009	I	0	“ I ’d better go . We ’re getting a ton of snow tonight , ”
16013	16021	16009	16009	I	0	“ The roads will probably be bad . ”
16022	16048	15985	15985	He	531	“ Yeah , we ’re getting some here too , but not like you guys are up there . Ca n’t say I miss it . ”
16078	16085	16086	16086	she	533	“ Oh , there you are , ”
16094	16125	16086	16086	she	533	“ I ’ve been texting Frannie . It ’s so bad out there , I do n’t want her to drive in the dark . The roads will be icy . ”
16126	16135	16136	16136	I	0	“ I ’ll bring her back , Daphne , ”
16140	16145	16136	16136	I	0	“ Do n’t worry . ”
16146	16149	16150	16150	She	533	“ Okay . ”
16156	16179	16150	16150	She	533	“ I ’d send John to come get her , but I worry that his eyesight is n’t great for night driving . ”
16180	16201	16136	16136	I	0	“ No problem . Really . My tires are good in the snow , and it ’s a short ride . ”
16207	16223	16202	16202	She	533	“ Thanks , Mack . You have daughters , so you know how it is . ”
16224	16233	16270	16270	her	533	“ I do . Have a good night . ”
16439	16442	16443	16443	Felicity	50	“ Daddy ! ”
16451	16456	16457	16457	She	50	“ You ’re home ! ”
16537	16550	16532	16533	their mother	163	“ I ’m home . Wow , it smells good in here . ”
16551	16556	16557	16557	Felicity	50	“ We made chili . ”
16568	16572	16557	16557	Felicity	50	“ And macaroni . ”
16573	16576	16578	16578	Frannie	47	“ Macarons , ”
16587	16608	16578	16578	Frannie	47	“ And if you do n’t stop calling them macaroni , I ’m never coming over to make them again . ”
16647	16665	16666	16666	Felicity	50	“ Well , whatever it is , it smells so good my belly sounds like a bear . ”
16674	16682	16668	16668	her	50	“ It does . You ’re right . ”
16690	16702	16684	16684	she	50	“ Did you know my dad has hair on his belly ? ”
16715	16731	16732	16732	She	50	“ Thanks , Mavis . Have I mentioned you have a goofy haircut yet today ? ”
16737	16740	16734	16734	her	50	“ No . ”
16741	16763	16734	16734	her	50	“ Well , you do . Now let me get my boots and coat off so I can eat , okay ? ”
16764	16767	16768	16768	I	0	“ Okay . ”
16849	16854	16842	16842	Winnie	51	“ Hi , Daddy . ”
16855	16865	16866	16866	I	0	“ Hey you . Long time , no see . ”
16926	16932	16933	16933	she	51	“ These things are amazing , ”
16941	16954	16933	16933	she	51	“ And they ’re gluten - free ! We used almond flour . ”
16955	16961	16962	16962	I	0	“ I had almond flour ? ”
16967	16980	16982	16982	Frannie	47	“ Winnie and I stopped at the store on the way here , ”
16994	17005	16984	16984	she	47	“ Let me know what I owe you for groceries . ”
17006	17013	17014	17014	She	51	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
17028	17039	17040	17040	Winnie	51	“ Daddy , did you know that macarons have feet ? ”
17047	17051	17052	17052	I	0	“ Imagine that , ”
17059	17066	17052	17052	I	0	“ You girls ate dinner already ? ”
17074	17085	17071	17071	her	49	“ Yes , and did my homework and practiced piano . ”
17109	17121	17122	17122	I	0	“ Where are my real daughters and who are these imposters ? ”
17144	17152	17125	17125	She	47	“ Here . This is for you . ”
17153	17160	17164	17164	her	47	“ Thanks . It looks awesome . ”
17180	17189	17190	17190	Frannie	47	“ Can I get you something to drink ? ”
17229	17240	17241	17241	I	0	“ Maybe some water , but I can get it . ”
17248	17256	17257	17257	She	47	“ I ’ve got it . Sit . ”
17264	17278	17257	17257	She	47	“ You just got here , and that drive had to be stressful . ”
17279	17283	17257	17257	She	47	“ It was . ”
17341	17351	17352	17352	Felicity	50	“ I got to help slice the bell peppers , ”
17356	17365	17352	17352	Felicity	50	“ And there ’s pumpkin in the chili ! ”
17366	17372	17374	17374	Winnie	51	“ I swifted the flour , ”
17376	17379	17381	17381	Frannie	47	“ Sifted , ”
17383	17409	17410	17410	Millie	49	“ And I separated the egg yolks from the whites for the macarons , but I messed up the first couple and wasted some eggs , ”
17417	17424	17410	17410	Millie	49	“ That ’s okay , Millie . ”
17441	17490	17425	17425	Frannie	47	“ It ’s tricky and takes practice . I used to mess that up all the time too . And you did a great job making sure the batter was mixed enough . Our meringue was perfect , and that ’s quite a feat for your first time . ”
17577	17586	17587	17587	Millie	49	“ Daddy , can we watch Andy Mack ? ”
17596	17612	17587	17587	Millie	49	“ Frannie said we had to wait until you got home to have screen time . ”
17619	17624	17613	17613	I	0	“ It ’s okay . ”
17666	17673	17653	17653	I	0	“ God , that was good . ”
17674	17679	17680	17680	Frannie	47	“ There ’s more , ”
17683	17686	17680	17680	Frannie	47	“ Sold . ”
17703	17715	17692	17692	I	0	“ One more bowl and then I ’ll drive you home . ”
17716	17728	17729	17729	she	47	“ Oh , you do n’t have to drive me home , ”
17751	17759	17729	17729	she	47	“ I promised your mother I would . ”
17776	17807	17760	17760	I	0	“ And the driving ’s bad . I would n’t feel right putting you out on the roads , especially not when you ’ve done so much for me today . ”
17846	17877	17878	17878	I	0	“ It was no big deal . I enjoyed it . My days can be pretty monotonous at the desk , especially in the winter when the inn gets slow . ”
17899	17917	17878	17878	I	0	“ Do you like working reception ? Is there another job you ’re interested in at Cloverleigh ? ”
17927	17969	17918	17918	She	173	“ Chloe offered to let me manage the Traverse City tasting room , but I actually do n’t know that much about the wine . I ’m better off at the inn . I like working with food , especially baking . ”
17970	18000	18001	18001	Her	173	“ From what I hear , you ’re amazing at it — and from what I taste , of course . Have you ever thought about opening a bakery ? ”
18008	18012	18001	18001	Her	173	“ A little . ”
18013	18016	17918	17918	She	173	“ And ? ”
18024	18063	18017	18017	She	173	“ I do n’t know . It takes a lot of time and money to start a business , and I ’m not very … adventurous . I do n’t think I ’d make a very good entrepreneur . ”
18064	18077	18078	18078	I	0	“ I think you could do anything you set your mind to , ”
18082	18085	18078	18078	I	0	“ Really ? ”
18101	18104	18086	18086	She	173	“ Really . ”
18105	18115	18116	18116	she	173	“ I guess I could talk to my dad , ”
18122	18133	18116	18116	she	173	“ But my mother would have a problem with it . ”
18134	18137	18086	18086	She	173	“ Why ? ”
18154	18198	18138	18138	She	173	“ It ’s not a big deal , really , but I was born with a heart defect that puts me at a slightly higher risk for a heart attack , believe it or not , so she ’s always worried about stress . ”
18199	18205	18206	18206	I	0	“ I never knew that , ”
18228	18234	18206	18206	I	0	“ Are you okay now ? ”
18235	18288	18138	18138	She	173	“ Yeah , I had surgeries to correct the problem when I was younger , but my mother has always been overly protective — both my parents , actually . Even though the doctors say I ’m fine , I feel like my parents look at me and see a sick kid . ”
18304	18331	18297	18297	I	0	“ As a father , I can understand that . We ca n’t help seeing our kids as innocent , helpless babies who need our protection . ”
18332	18341	18342	18342	she	571	“ Well , I ’m not a baby , ”
18345	18357	18342	18342	she	571	“ And I do n’t want to be treated like one . ”
18376	18452	18372	18372	her	571	“ I ’m sorry , Frannie . I did n’t mean you ’re a baby . I meant that it ’s hard for a dad to let go . Mentally , we know our kids need us to , so they can make their own way in the world , but in our hearts , we ca n’t stop trying to prevent them from making mistakes . We never want to see them get hurt . ”
18458	18515	18453	18453	She	571	“ Sorry . I did n’t mean to snap at you . I had an argument with my mother earlier , and … I just get a little tired of being seen as a kid all the time . I want to be seen as an adult capable of making my own decisions . You know ? ”
18576	18581	18562	18562	I	0	“ I hear you . ”
18582	18594	18595	18595	She	571	“ I mean , I ’m twenty - seven years old . ”
18601	18616	18595	18595	She	571	“ Do n’t you think I should be allowed to make a few mistakes ? ”
18831	18843	18816	18816	he	104	“ Sure . Everybody needs to make mistakes now and then . ”
18948	18955	18956	18956	he	104	“ I should get you home , ”
18963	18970	18956	18956	he	104	“ Want to grab your coat ? ”
18971	18974	18956	18956	he	104	“ Sure . ”
19011	19022	19023	19023	I	0	“ Want me to put the chili in the fridge ? ”
19026	19036	19023	19023	I	0	“ I can do it when I get back . ”
19037	19048	19064	19064	He	104	“ Okay . I ’ll say goodnight to the girls . ”
19049	19063	19064	19064	He	104	“ Actually , they should probably come with us . It ’s late . ”
19081	19099	19064	19064	He	104	“ Can you tell them to put on their stuff ? I ’ll warm up the car . ”
19100	19103	19104	19104	I	0	“ Yes . ”
19138	19149	19124	19124	Mack	104	“ Of course , my fucking car wo n’t start . ”
19158	19166	19155	19155	her	585	“ That ’s a dollar , Daddy . ”
19172	19182	19167	19167	He	104	“ I should get a freebie for car trouble . ”
19183	19189	19190	19190	I	0	“ Is it the battery ? ”
19199	19228	19190	19190	I	0	“ Maybe . But the way it ’s parked in the garage , we would n’t even be able to get your car close enough to jump it . ”
19229	19274	19275	19275	His	104	“ What about using my car to drive me home ? You can drop me off and borrow it for tomorrow . Or for as long as you need . I can always use my mom ’s SUV if I need to go somewhere . ”
19279	19320	19275	19275	His	104	“ I could try , but your car is pretty well buried . Might take me a while to dig it out . Was it okay on the roads earlier ? The streets have n’t even been plowed here yet . ”

19683	19690	19697	19697	he	104	“ Otherwise she ’ll freak out . ”
19691	19696	19697	19697	he	104	“ I get it , ”
19700	19725	19697	19697	he	104	“ Yay ! Then we can bake something in the morning for breakfast . Frannie knows how to make gluten - free monkey bread ! ”
19737	19754	19732	19732	He	104	“ Well , I guess that settles it . I ca n’t turn down monkey bread . ”

19969	20010	19932	19932	Mack	104	“ Yes . The girls are all excited about baking something in the morning . And I do n’t want Daddy out driving tonight . The roads are terrible and you know how bad his eyes are in the dark . ”

20020	20048	20017	20017	she	318	“ I ’ll text you in the morning . The kids do n’t have school , so Mack and I will probably bring them over to Cloverleigh . ”

32939	32949	32885	32885	I	0	“ No , it ’s fine . Sit down . ”

32971	32979	32871	32871	He	72	“ I ca n’t even do that . ”
32987	32998	32981	32981	I	0	“ Hey , can I ask you for a favor ? ”
32999	33006	32871	32871	He	72	“ Sure . What ’s up ? ”
33007	33026	33027	33027	He	72	“ Could you drive me and the kids home ? Whenever you ’re ready to go is fine . ”
33030	33036	33027	33027	He	72	“ Ready whenever you are . ”
33037	33071	32871	32871	He	72	“ And if it ’s not too much trouble , could we try giving my car a jump ? It ’s in my garage , so we ’d have to get it out . ”
33072	33076	33027	33027	He	72	“ No problem . ”
33077	33090	33027	33027	He	72	“ Thanks . Give me about twenty minutes to round everybody up . ”
33091	33099	33100	33100	I	0	“ I ’ll be in my office . ”
33481	33489	33491	33491	Millie	49	“ This is like dessert before dinner , ”

33615	33626	33612	33612	I	0	“ That ’s fine . Can I talk to you ? ”
33645	33652	33640	33640	he	812	“ Out here in the hallway . ”
33653	33656	33657	33657	I	0	“ Oh . ”
33663	33666	33657	33657	I	0	“ Okay . ”
33698	33703	33688	33688	I	0	“ What ’s up ? ”
33704	33707	33708	33708	He	812	“ Frannie . ”
33714	33717	33708	33708	He	812	“ What ? ”
33718	33722	33688	33688	I	0	“ Stop it . ”
33723	33759	33688	33688	I	0	“ Stop what ? I ’m doing exactly what you told me to do — pretending nothing happened . Going back to the way things were before . You ’re the one who ’s angry . ”
33760	33766	33767	33767	He	812	“ I ’m angry because … ”
33775	33784	33767	33767	He	812	“ This is n’t how it was before . ”
33785	33791	33792	33792	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
33803	33830	33792	33792	I	0	“ You did n’t freeze me out like this before . You did n’t refuse to look at me . We could joke around and talk . ”
33831	33841	33842	33842	He	812	“ Maybe I do n’t feel like joking around . ”
33847	33851	33842	33842	He	812	“ Why not ? ”
33865	33881	33882	33882	His	812	“ Because , Mack . Last night meant everything to me and nothing to you . ”
33893	33908	33887	33887	his	812	“ That ’s not true . It did mean something to me , Frannie . ”
33909	33928	33844	33844	his	812	“ Then why do we have to pretend it never happened ? Why ca n’t it happen again ? ”
33929	33946	33887	33887	his	812	“ Because there are too many complications . You know I ’m in an impossible situation . ”
33947	33997	33998	33998	His	812	“ No , I do n’t . Last night , you asked me what chances I would take if I was n’t scared . I did n’t get the opportunity to answer you then , but I ’ll tell you right now — I’d take a chance on you . ”
34010	34020	33998	33998	His	812	“ You do n’t know what you ’re saying . ”
34030	34061	34027	34027	I	0	“ Maybe I do n’t . Maybe I am too young and immature . Maybe I ’m stupid to think that you and I could ever be more than friends . ”
34062	34079	34080	34080	I	0	“ You ’re not stupid , Frannie . And in another life , we could be . ”
34085	34116	34082	34082	my	0	“ There is no other life , Mack . This is the only one we get . Look , you probably have sex like that all the time , but — ”
34122	34159	34117	34117	Mack	104	“ Are you kidding me ? I have n’t had sex in over a year . And last night was fucking amazing . I have n’t been able to think about anything else all day long . ”
34173	34213	34163	34163	I	0	“ Then I do n’t understand why you ca n’t give me a chance . I feel something for you , Mack . I have for a long time — I’ve just been too scared to act on it . ”
34214	34222	34223	34223	He	104	“ You were right to be scared . ”
34268	34289	34261	34261	he	104	“ Do n’t waste your chances on me , Frannie . I ’ve got nothing to offer you in return . ”
34371	34375	34376	34376	she	64	“ Jeez Louise , ”
34379	34385	34376	34376	she	64	“ What happened to you ? ”
34386	34392	34393	34393	I	0	“ What do you want ? ”
34402	34427	34393	34393	I	0	“ Well , I was gon na ask your opinion on some new label designs , but maybe now ’s not a good time . ”
34428	34433	34434	34434	I	0	“ It ’s not . ”
34452	34457	34434	34434	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
34479	34482	34467	34467	her	64	“ nothing , ”
34539	34546	34547	34547	I	0	“ You ca n’t tell anyone , ”
34556	34561	34550	34550	She	237	“ Scout ’s honor . ”
34562	34568	34569	34569	I	0	“ I slept with Mack , ”
34580	34584	34573	34573	Her	237	“ You what ? ”
34585	34591	34550	34550	She	237	“ I slept with Mack . ”
34592	34606	34607	34607	She	237	“ Holy shit . Holy . Shit . I got ta sit down . ”
34624	34633	34634	34634	She	237	“ You slept with Mack ? Like you … ”
34657	34673	34652	34652	I	0	“ Yes , Chloe . I had sex with him . You can say it . ”
34674	34682	34683	34683	She	237	“ Whoa . I mean — whoa . ”
34688	34697	34683	34683	She	237	“ Sorry , I ’m just really surprised . ”
34698	34704	34705	34705	I	0	“ That I did it ? ”
34722	34732	34705	34705	I	0	“ Or that I ’m telling you about it ? ”
34733	34736	34738	34738	she	237	“ Both . ”
34741	34753	34738	34738	she	237	“ Actually , I ’m surprised you have sex at all . ”
34754	34761	34762	34762	I	0	“ Of course I have sex , ”
34765	34782	34762	34762	I	0	“ I ’m a grown woman , not that anyone around here seems to realize it . ”
34783	34788	34789	34789	she	237	“ Hey , relax , ”
34799	34838	34789	34789	she	237	“ You do n’t have to get mad . I ’m glad you ’re telling me . Frankly , it ’s a relief . It makes you human . It ’s just a surprise , that ’s all . ”
34839	34849	34850	34850	I	0	“ It ’s a surprise that I ’m human ? ”
34853	34857	34850	34850	I	0	“ Kind of . ”
34863	34901	34858	34858	She	237	“ You ’ve always been such a Mommy ’s girl . So well - behaved and just … good . I never knew there was another side to you . You ’ve never shown it to me . ”
34912	34937	34860	34860	her	237	“ Well , I ’m tired of being treated like a little girl , so I guess I ’d better stop acting like it . ”
34938	34947	34948	34948	she	237	“ You ’re off to a good start , ”
34952	34959	34948	34948	she	237	“ So , Mack , huh ? ”
34960	34963	34860	34860	her	237	“ Mack . ”
34993	35017	34990	34990	her	64	“ You want to hear something funny ? At the Christmas party last year , April swore something was up with you two . ”
35018	35022	34990	34990	her	64	“ She did ? ”
35023	35052	35053	35053	She	64	“ Yes . She kept seeing you guys talking and looking at each other , and she asked me what I thought , and I said no way . ”
35056	35062	35053	35053	She	64	“ Guess I was wrong . ”
35063	35066	35067	35067	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
35071	35081	35067	35067	I	0	“ I ’ve had a crush on him forever . ”
35082	35089	35090	35090	Chloe	64	“ So when did this happen ? ”
35096	35128	35092	35092	her	64	“ Last night . I was watching the girls and stayed overnight because of the weather . After the girls went to bed , one thing kind of led to another . ”
35129	35143	35144	35144	I	0	“ Got it . So what happened afterward ? Was he a jerk ? ”
35152	35188	35144	35144	I	0	“ Yes and no . He said we had to forget it happened and go back to being just friends — I’m too young , I ’m the boss ’s daughter , blah blah blah . ”
35193	35201	35189	35190	My sister	237	“ He ’s not wrong , exactly . ”
35207	35230	35205	35205	her	64	“ Yes he is , Chloe . I ’m not that young . And I ca n’t help who my father is . ”
35231	35238	35205	35205	her	64	“ So what did you say ? ”
35239	35283	35284	35284	I	0	“ I agreed , because I did n’t want to seem like a baby , and because I was scared to say how I really felt . So I tried to pretend like I did n’t care . But it was so awkward . ”
35291	35338	35288	35288	my	0	“ We had to bring the kids to Cloverleigh because they had a snow day , and when he came up here to get them , he said he wanted to talk to me in the hall . Then he accused me of freezing him out . ”
35344	35354	35341	35341	her	828	“ Of course . He wants it both ways . ”
35355	35381	35382	35382	I	0	“ I gave up pretending and told him my feelings were hurt . That I could n’t just forget it as easily as he could . ”
35402	35432	35398	35398	he	829	“ He claimed it was n’t easy for him either , but that he ’s in an impossible situation . And he said he had nothing to offer me . ”
35433	35436	35437	35437	Chloe	64	“ Hmm . ”
35452	35481	35437	35437	Chloe	64	“ Maybe he ’s right . I mean , he just got divorced and he ’s got three little kids . He probably does n’t want a girlfriend . ”
35487	35503	35482	35482	I	0	“ It ’s not like I ’d be demanding . And I love his kids . ”
35504	35511	35512	35512	She	64	“ I ’m sorry , hon . ”
35519	35528	35512	35512	She	64	“ I do n’t know what to say . ”
35538	35558	35529	35529	Sighing	93	“ I ’m curious about his divorce . Like what happened . Do you think Sylvia would know anything ? ”
35576	35598	35599	35599	She	64	“ It ’s possible . They used to be pretty good friends . But she ’s been gone for so long . ”
35602	35608	35599	35599	She	64	“ You could ask her . ”
35614	35619	35609	35609	I	0	“ I ca n’t . ”
35620	35624	35609	35609	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
35625	35641	35609	35609	I	0	“ Because we do n’t talk like that . She ’d think it was weird . ”
35651	35693	35609	35609	I	0	“ Frannie , I ’m just going to say this out loud because I ’m thinking it and even though I have worked very hard on my filter over the years , I feel like it ’s something you should hear . ”
35694	35697	35698	35698	I	0	“ Okay , ”
35702	35733	35698	35698	I	0	“ I ’ve never been in here like this before . Sitting down with you , just the two of us . Having a really personal conversation . Sharing secrets . ”
35738	35750	35734	35734	She	237	“ And the reason is because you ’ve never invited me . ”
35751	35754	35755	35755	I	0	“ Well … ”
35763	35825	35755	35755	I	0	“ You ’re always so busy . And I did n’t think you ’d want to talk to me . I do n’t really feel like any of you want to talk to me . You ’ll think this is stupid , but I feel like you ’re all part of this secret sister club and I ’m not in it . “
35836	35841	35826	35826	I	0	” she said seriously . “
35900	35901	35902	35902	I	0	” “
35906	35914	35915	35915	I	0	” I said , my teeth clenched . “
36000	36001	36002	36002	I	0	” “
36006	36010	36002	36002	I	0	” Chloe said . “
36051	36052	36053	36053	You	0	” “
36059	36075	36053	36053	You	0	” I said . It was a relief to finally say these things out loud . “
36085	36091	36100	36101	the youngest	1812	” Chloe thought about it . “
36126	36134	36135	36135	I	0	” I nodded , my eyes filling . “
36169	36170	36160	36160	I	0	” “
36173	36181	36160	36160	I	0	” She put her hand over mine . “
36240	36244	36245	36245	I	0	” I sniffed . “
36260	36264	36250	36250	You	0	” She shrugged . “
36336	36337	36327	36327	Mom	74	” “
36346	36351	36338	36338	Mom	74	” She looked surprised . “
36355	36388	36389	36389	I	0	” I filled her in on my hopes to start my own business , the offer I ’d had from Mrs. Radley , and our mother ’s immediate dismissal of the idea . “
36397	36402	36389	36389	I	0	” she said excitedly . “
36432	36451	36458	36458	her	74	” I did n’t think I could ever hate my mother , but I knew what Chloe meant . “
36461	36466	36458	36458	her	74	” She nodded thoughtfully . “
36482	36494	36495	36495	I	0	” I sighed , fitting the tips of my thumbnails together . “
36555	36561	36562	36562	You	0	” I peeked at her . “
36571	36572	36562	36562	You	0	” “
36577	36586	36562	36562	You	0	” She reached over and patted my arm . “
36652	36656	36638	36638	He	53	” I nodded . “
36688	36689	36664	36664	I	0	” “
36692	36696	36664	36664	I	0	” Chloe agreed . “
36729	36730	36797	36797	Mack	104	” “
36733	36796	36797	36797	Mack	104	” I felt my mood lift a little at the prospect of spending an evening with my sister . Something had shifted between Chloe and me — it felt like a barrier had been removed . And it would be good to have an ally in the battle for my parents ’ support . Something good might come out of this day yet .
37212	37223	37224	37224	I	0	“ So did you have a good time at Cloverleigh ? ”
37240	37251	37252	37252	I	0	“ Yes . The sleigh ride was so much fun . ”
37263	37270	37252	37252	I	0	“ Was that your favorite part ? ”
37271	37280	37252	37252	I	0	“ Yes . Can I have a horse ? ”
37281	37284	37285	37285	She	51	“ No . ”
37288	37303	37285	37285	She	51	“ I did n’t think so . Can we take another sleigh ride tomorrow ? ”
37328	37338	37313	37313	Her	51	“ Maybe not tomorrow , but sometime . Goodnight . ”
37339	37351	37304	37304	I	0	“ Wait , Daddy ! Did you look under the bed ? ”
37352	37360	37313	37313	Her	51	“ Oh , sorry . I forgot . ”
37373	37382	37383	37383	She	51	“ All clear . Just some dust bunnies . ”
37386	37398	37383	37383	She	51	“ Those are okay . Kiss Ned the Hammerhead from Shedd . ”
37433	37441	37399	37399	I	0	“ That thing does not look cuddly . ”
37442	37464	37383	37383	She	51	“ I know , but I love him . I do n’t feel right if he ’s not next to me . ”
37465	37478	37399	37399	I	0	“ Then I guess he can stay . Love you , princess . ”
37479	37487	37399	37399	I	0	“ I love you too , Daddy . ”
37490	37522	37399	37399	I	0	” Leaving her door open the way she liked it , I went into Felicity ’s room . Her nightlight glowed in the dark , and she was under the covers . “
37525	37537	37399	37399	I	0	” I asked , sitting on the bed . She yawned . “
37540	37541	37399	37399	I	0	” “

37568	37623	37565	37565	She	47	” I thought of her hurt expression from earlier and my chest felt tight . What would happen if she decided she did n’t want to nanny for me anymore ? Then the girls would lose her , and it would be my fault completely . God , I ’d really fucked this up . “
37645	37646	37631	37631	She	47	” “
37649	37650	37631	37631	She	47	” “
37677	37740	37669	37669	She	47	” She brought her hand out from under the covers and opened her fist . On her palm lay a small , smooth stone . I switched on the lamp on her nightstand and looked closer . It was a crystal of some sort , with streaks of purple and green and lavender running through it . The perfect gift for Felicity . “
37747	37761	37669	37669	She	47	” She closed her fist and tucked her arm beneath the blankets again . “
37769	37770	37669	37669	She	47	” “
37777	37791	37669	37669	She	47	” I switched off the lamp , leaned over and kissed her cheek . “
37796	37800	37794	37794	Mavis	52	” She giggled . “
37805	37806	37803	37803	Daddy	48	” “

37836	37871	37813	37813	I	0	” she said . When I opened the door , I saw her reading in bed by the light of the lamp on her nightstand . I went in and sat by her feet . “
37874	37875	37813	37813	I	0	” “
37878	37889	37900	37900	You	0	” She did n’t lift her eyes from her book . “

37931	37937	37926	37926	you	53	” she said , annoyed . “

37982	37993	37977	37977	I	0	” Concerned , I set her book on her nightstand . “

38011	38081	38082	38082	Millie	49	” I did n’t believe her . Clearly there was an issue , but she was n’t going to tell me what it was . For a moment I panicked that it was something related to puberty , and I got lightheaded and sweaty . What the hell was I going to do when all those changes set in ? God , why could n’t they stay young forever ? “
38087	38098	38082	38082	Millie	49	” My voice cracked , and I cleared my throat . “
38107	38108	38082	38082	Millie	49	” “
38117	38127	38115	38115	Dad	319	” She rolled away from me onto her side . “

38136	38196	38197	38197	Dad	53	” I leaned over , kissed her head , and switched off her lamp . Her hair smelled sweet , too , but not like baby shampoo . More fruity . Like women ’s shampoo . Then I stood there a moment looking at her , wondering where the years had gone . It seemed like only yesterday that — “
38199	38200	38197	38197	Dad	53	” “
38203	38204	38197	38197	Dad	53	” “

38265	38266	38246	38246	You	49	” “
38269	38278	38246	38246	You	49	” I reached her doorway and turned around . “
38283	38284	38246	38246	You	49	” “
38289	38715	38716	38716	Millie	49	” I felt a little better as I went downstairs , but not much . Millie ’s stomachaches , like Felicity ’s nightmares and Winifred ’s monsters , had begun after their mother left and usually flared any time Carla said she was coming to visit , even though she rarely followed through . In the kitchen , I went over to where Millie ’s phone was plugged in , picked it up , and entered her passcode . She and I had an agreement — I allowed her to have a phone , and she allowed me access to it at any time to make sure she was n’t on social media or texting with serial killers . Every now and then , I glanced at her messages , but mostly there were just long threads full of emojis between her and a few friends , and occasionally texts from her mother . When I saw that Carla had been in touch today , Millie ’s stomachache made sense . Hello darling , I just wanted to tell you how excited I am to come see you ! Remember not to say anything to your sisters so the visit can be a surprise ! I ’m only telling you because you sent me the note saying how much you miss me . It was so sweet of you to write me , but hearing that you are sad because of me made me feel sad too . I had a migraine for days afterward . I really wish I could be there for the mother daughter fashion show you mentioned , but that date is n’t good for me . But I will see you Friday and we ’ll have such a good time ! I set the phone down , my blood boiling . I ’d specifically asked Carla not to tell the kids about her visit , and she ’d gone behind my back immediately and messaged Millie . And how fucking dare she make Millie feel guilty for telling her mother she misses her ! Seething , I paced the kitchen . I wanted to punch something . Throw something . Destroy something . Opening the back door , I took a few gulps of icy air to calm myself down , but it barely had an effect . Then I came in the house and downed a shot of whiskey . Ten seconds later I was going up the stairs three at a time , then opening Millie ’s door . “

38750	38764	38765	38765	I	0	” I walked over to her bed and sat down at her feet . “
38782	38785	38786	38786	She	49	” Silence . “

38966	38977	38978	38978	I	0	” I exhaled , guilt weighing heavily on my shoulders . “
38984	38991	38982	38982	Mills	56	” Millie was silent a moment . “

39006	39027	39003	39003	she	893	” I leaned over her , bracing a hand above her shoulder and brushing her hair back from her face . “

39039	39063	39036	39036	you	56	” It should have made me happy , but I still felt like somehow , it was n’t enough . I tried again . “

39161	39169	39158	39158	I	0	” She was quiet for a moment . “
39187	39192	39170	39170	Mom	74	” My composure slipped . “
39198	39203	39170	39170	Mom	74	” Then I sighed . “

39349	39356	39359	39359	I	0	” That brought a little smile . “

39422	39442	39419	39419	I	0	” Getting off the bed , I did my best John Travolta Saturday Night Fever strut across her room . “

39565	39603	39529	39529	I	0	” I said , pointing a finger at her . She smiled , and I almost felt like things were okay in the world again . Maybe I was n’t Superdad , but I was doing this . “
39609	39875	39607	39607	honey	1898	” I blew her a kiss and headed for the door . Downstairs , I folded some laundry , stacked everyone ’s piles in baskets , and opened up my laptop on the dining room table . I emailed Sawyer and DeSantis that I would n’t be in tomorrow because of childcare issues , asked if meetings could please be rescheduled , and apologized for the late notice . Then I tried to tackle some of the work tasks that I ’d been unable to finish during the day , but I still found it hard to concentrate . At midnight , I finally gave up and went to bed , but even though I was tired , I could n’t fall asleep . I was mad at Carla , worried she would n’t show , worried she would show , concerned about Millie , fearful I was n’t handling her questions right , anxious about the future , and desperate to make things right with Frannie again . But how ? I could n’t go backward and undo what we ’d done . I could n’t unhear the words she ’d spoken . I could n’t unfeel this longing for her . But I could n’t act on it , either . My girls aside , Frannie deserved someone who could put her first , someone at the same stage of life she was in , who had all the time and energy in the world to dedicate to making her happy . I was awake half the night wishing that someone could be me .

43500	43524	43490	43490	she	978	“ No . I ’m not a huge drinker , but I do like a little whiskey by the fire now and then . ”

43643	43648	43630	43630	she	47	“ This is nice . ”
43664	43684	43685	43685	She	47	“ It is . Much nicer than what I was heading home to , which was an empty house . ”
43693	43702	43685	43685	She	47	“ So the girls are with your sister ? ”
43703	43738	43685	43685	She	47	“ Yeah . Jodie . She ’s got a daughter a year older than Millie and a son Felicity ’s age . They all get along really well . I wish they lived closer . ”
43739	43755	43756	43756	She	47	“ I wish Sylvia lived closer too . I hardly know my nieces and nephew . ”
43760	43775	43756	43756	She	47	“ How is Sylvia ? I have n’t spoken to her in a while . ”
43776	43792	43685	43685	She	47	“ Good , I guess . I do n’t talk to her much , either . ”
43805	43831	43832	43832	I	0	“ That ’s something I ’d like to change , though . I should reach out to her . Are you close to your sister ? ”
43835	43882	43832	43832	I	0	“ Pretty close . I mean , we ’re both busy with kids and jobs , but we were tight growing up . She ’s only seventeen months older than me . And she ’s married to a great guy . They make it look easy . ”
43893	43909	43889	43889	her	47	“ Can I ask what happened with your marriage , or is it too personal ? ”
43919	43961	43910	43910	I	0	“ My marriage was tough from the start . Carla got pregnant with Millie right before I was set to deploy , and we got married fast before I left . We ’d only known each other for a few months . ”
43962	43967	43968	43968	she	47	“ Marines , right ? ”
43971	43974	43968	43968	she	47	“ Yeah . ”
43975	43981	43910	43910	I	0	“ What made you join ? ”
43982	44039	43968	43968	she	47	“ I was kinda lost for a while in my early twenties , did n’t really know what I wanted to do yet . I ’d dropped out of college because I was too immature to handle the responsibility and my parents told me they were n’t going to pay for me to fuck around anymore . ”
44045	44079	43968	43968	she	47	“ I needed to burn off some energy and I wanted to get out of here . One day I decided being a Marine sounded kind of badass . So I signed up . ”
44080	44087	44088	44088	I	0	“ And you were in Afghanistan ? ”
44091	44182	44088	44088	I	0	“ Twice . And I was in Iraq too . So I was gone a lot during the early years of our marriage , while the older two girls were little . That did n’t help . Then , when I got out , I wanted to move back up here where I ’d grown up , and she wanted to move to Georgia , where she was from . She said she ’d agree to come here if I agreed to have another baby . So we did both . ”
44190	44213	44183	44183	I	0	“ But it did n’t matter where we lived . We never really made each other happy . Eventually resentment set in . ”
44214	44219	43968	43968	she	47	“ Resentment over what ? ”
44226	44317	44220	44220	She	986	“ Oh God , you name it . She resented feeling like I ’d married her out of a sense of duty more than anything else . She resented being left alone with kids while I was deployed . Then when I came home and struggled to readjust to civilian life , she resented me for not bouncing back faster . She also felt abandoned again because I worked during the day , managing a hardware store , and went to classes at night so I could finish my degree . ”
44326	44343	44318	44318	Frannie	47	“ How ’d you end up at Cloverleigh ? Did Sylvia get you the job here ? ”
44344	44379	44183	44183	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’d finished my degree and was looking for a better job , and I ran into her one day when she was home . She introduced me to your dad . ”
44380	44392	44220	44220	She	986	“ Did things get better once you had a good job ? ”
44393	44418	44318	44318	Frannie	47	“ Not really . We fought all the time , and when we were n’t fighting , there was a lot of angry silence . ”
44419	44426	44183	44183	I	0	“ That must have been awful . ”
44427	44431	44432	44432	I	0	“ It was . ”
44435	44486	44432	44432	I	0	“ I tried to make it work , I really did — especially for the kids ’ sake . But nothing I did or said was right , and I got tired of being the bad guy . Eventually I stopped trying , and she ran off with someone else . ”
44487	44492	44493	44493	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
44498	44538	44493	44493	I	0	“ Do n’t be , not for me , anyway . It ’s not like Carla and I had some great love affair . But our kids deserved better . I feel horrible every day that I failed them . ”
44539	44548	44549	44549	She	987	“ You did n’t fail them , Mack . ”
44557	44571	44549	44549	She	987	“ Sometimes marriages do n’t work out . It was n’t your fault . ”
44655	44666	44646	44646	Frannie	47	“ The girls do n’t talk about their mother much . ”
44672	44729	44667	44667	I	0	“ Not anymore . They missed her a lot at first , but since she ’s only seen them a couple times since , the separation anxiety has eased . I ’m sure somewhere in each of them is a gaping wound and a permanent fear of abandonment , but day to day they seem okay . ”
44730	44738	44739	44739	Frannie	47	“ That ’s a credit to you , ”
44742	44747	44739	44739	Frannie	47	“ And their therapist . ”
44755	44784	44785	44785	Frannie	47	“ I ’ll be paying those bills for years to come . Millie ’s been asking some tough questions lately , wondering if her mother even loves her . ”
44788	44794	44785	44785	Frannie	47	“ What did you say ? ”
44795	44820	44821	44821	I	0	“ I said yes , and I think that ’s the truth , but fuck if I know what ’s in Carla ’s head . ”
44834	44852	44821	44821	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Frannie . I did n’t mean to unload all that on you . ”
44853	44856	44857	44857	she	47	“ Hey , ”
44868	44883	44857	44857	she	47	“ I want you to unload on me . You can tell me anything . ”
44999	45002	45003	45003	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
45006	45048	45003	45003	I	0	“ But you know what ? Nights like this are going to be few and far between , possibly nonexistent , and I do n’t want to waste any more of it complaining about my ex . Tell me about you . ”
45060	45068	45055	45055	she	47	“ What do you want to know ? ”
45069	45072	45073	45073	I	0	“ Hmmm . ”
45094	45110	45111	45111	She	47	“ Mostly I want to know why you ’re not closer to me right now . ”
45170	45174	45175	45175	she	47	“ Now what ? ”
45178	45193	45175	45175	she	47	“ Now I want to know why you ’re still wearing so many clothes . ”
45280	45285	45286	45286	I	0	“ Does it hurt ? ”
45294	45301	45289	45289	She	47	“ What was the surgery for ? ”
45302	45340	45291	45291	her	47	“ I was born with a congenital heart defect called a bicuspid aortic valve . I had several surgeries as a baby to repair the valve , and eventually one to replace it when I was ten . ”
45341	45346	45347	45347	I	0	“ That sounds scary . ”
45365	45371	45347	45347	I	0	“ You ’re okay now ? ”
45372	45446	45291	45291	her	47	“ I ’m totally fine . The worst that happens is I can get tired easily , and I have to watch my cholesterol . I have a slightly elevated risk of an aneurysm or heart failure . But I ’m very good about paying attention to my body , and I eat right and exercise , and take all my meds and keep all my doctor appointments like a good little girl . ”
45447	45450	45451	45451	I	0	“ Good . ”
45462	45479	45459	45459	she	47	“ I know it ’s really ugly , but I ’ve made my peace with it . ”
45485	45497	45480	45480	I	0	“ Every inch of you is beautiful . Inside and out . ”
45498	45508	45509	45509	she	47	“ That ’s how I feel about you too , ”
45623	45628	45629	45629	I	0	“ Jesus fucking Christ , ”
45880	45883	45884	45884	she	47	“ Mack , ”
45887	45890	45884	45884	she	47	“ Yeah ? ”
45891	45900	45901	45901	I	0	“ Do you have to go home tonight ? ”
46053	46056	46057	46057	I	0	“ No , ”
46061	46069	46057	46057	I	0	“ I could stay here with you . ”
46076	46086	46070	46070	She	47	“ Do you want to stay here with me ? ”
46087	46090	46091	46091	I	0	“ Yes , ”
46100	46104	46091	46091	I	0	“ I do . ”
46358	46361	46362	46362	I	0	“ Hi , ”
46367	46370	46362	46362	I	0	“ Hi . ”
46391	46396	46371	46371	He	104	“ Was I snoring ? ”
46397	46404	46354	46354	His	104	“ No . Do you snore ? ”
46405	46429	46430	46430	My	0	“ I do n’t think so . But the girls tease me about it . Teasing me is their favorite thing to do . ”
46434	46447	46430	46430	My	0	“ What else do they tease you about ? Besides your cooking . ”
46448	46457	46354	46354	His	104	“ My hairy stomach , my hairy chest — ”
46458	46471	46354	46354	His	104	“ I like the hair on your chest . It ’s hot . ”
46472	46486	46354	46354	His	104	“ Thank you . Then there are my wrinkles , my gray hair — ”
46487	46503	46354	46354	His	104	“ You do not have wrinkles . And I like your gray hair , too . ”
46516	46521	46504	46504	I	0	“ You ’re perfect . ”
46535	46541	46527	46527	he	1001	“ Come back to bed . ”
46559	46567	46568	46568	I	0	“ I ’ve only got a minute , ”
46589	46595	46580	46580	He	1001	“ You have to work ? ”
46596	46599	46600	46600	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
46603	46618	46600	46600	I	0	“ I wish I did n’t . What are you going to do today ? ”
46619	46666	46580	46580	He	1001	“ Pick up the kids . Clean the house . Grocery shop . Attempt to catch up on work . Your dad ’s probably going to fire me for being so behind . That is , if he does n’t fire me for seducing his daughter . ”
46667	46675	46676	46676	I	0	“ You definitely did not seduce me . ”
46687	46695	46676	46676	I	0	“ You just kept me up late . ”
46696	46699	46700	46700	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
46703	46706	46700	46700	I	0	“ Liar . ”
46717	46727	46711	46711	his	1002	“ You ’re right , that was a lie . ”
46742	46758	46732	46732	I	0	“ Sheesh . I ’ve never been so sore . My abs are killing me . ”
46759	46765	46766	46766	He	1002	“ But you feel okay ? ”
46774	46786	46787	46787	I	0	“ I mean , your heart is n’t stressed or anything ? ”
46790	46799	46800	46800	He	1002	“ Oh , now I see the wrinkles . ”
46874	46890	46891	46891	he	1002	“ You know what I do to my girls when they make fun of me ? ”
46907	46910	46891	46891	he	1002	“ What ? ”
46923	46931	46911	46911	I	0	“ It ’s called the tickle torture . ”
46932	46952	46953	46953	I	0	“ No ! No , please ! I ’m so ticklish — don’t — no , not the neck — ”
46984	46989	46990	46990	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
46993	47010	46990	46990	I	0	“ I ’m sorry I made fun of you ! I ’ll never do it again ! ”
47011	47017	47018	47018	He	1002	“ Now who ’s lying ? ”
47028	47040	47018	47018	He	1002	“ I was serious about your heart . Are you okay ? ”
47041	47074	47076	47076	I	0	“ Yes . Your concern is very sweet , but no amount of sex is going to cause my heart to fail , no matter how good it is . I promise . ”
47080	47095	47076	47076	I	0	“ Your dick is big , but not big enough to puncture my aorta . ”
47096	47101	47102	47102	He	1002	“ That ’s it . ”
47127	47138	47139	47139	I	0	“ I ’ll be good , I ’m begging you , ”
47142	47172	47139	47139	I	0	“ I ’m going to be late for work . I have to be down there in like ten minutes and I have n’t even combed my hair yet . ”
47173	47189	47190	47190	I	0	“ Want me to comb it for you ? I ’m really good at it . ”
47193	47205	47190	47190	I	0	“ Stop it . Millie is always complaining about your buns . ”
47206	47229	47230	47230	He	1002	“ Okay , I ’m shit at the bun thing , but I am awesome at combing hair . I ’m serious . ”
47243	47249	47240	47240	his	1002	“ Go get your brush . ”
47250	47279	47190	47190	I	0	“ Mack , you do not have to brush my hair . It ’s all wet and tangled . Do you know what a chore it will be ? ”
47280	47310	47311	47311	I	0	“ I do n’t care . There are n’t many things I can do for you , and you do so much for me . Let me do this . ”
47336	47339	47324	47324	Mack	104	“ Okay . ”
47372	47377	47378	47378	I	0	“ Here you go , ”
47469	47472	47473	47473	he	104	“ There , ”
47476	47481	47473	47473	he	104	“ How was that ? ”
47482	47485	47486	47486	We	1006	“ Perfect . ”
47496	47510	47511	47511	He	104	“ You were right — you’re awesome at combing hair . Thank you . ”
47525	47530	47511	47511	He	104	“ You ’re welcome . ”
47554	47564	47543	47543	He	104	“ This was so much fun . Thank you . ”
47565	47576	47577	47577	I	0	“ You do n’t have to thank me , silly . ”
47592	47598	47577	47577	I	0	“ I had fun too . ”
47599	47611	47543	47543	He	104	“ I hope no one catches me sneaking out of here . ”
47612	47635	47642	47642	He	104	“ You know , I really do n’t care what my parents think about us . We do n’t have to hide . ”
47636	47641	47642	47642	He	104	“ But I care . ”
47655	47694	47642	47642	He	104	“ Your family is good to me . And this complicates not only our working relationship , but also things with my kids . Can we keep it to ourselves for a little while ? Is that okay ? ”
47695	47699	47642	47642	He	104	“ Of course . ”
47700	47703	47704	47704	He	104	“ Thanks . ”
47713	47731	47704	47704	He	104	“ I want to do this again . But I have no idea when that will be . ”
47732	47773	47774	47774	He	104	“ It ’s okay , Mack . I meant what I said last night . I do n’t need promises and I wo n’t make demands . Whenever we can steal a little time together is good enough for me . ”
47779	47788	47774	47774	He	104	“ You ’re too good to be true . ”
47792	47801	47806	47806	she	236	“ You ’re in a good mood today , ”
47817	47823	47806	47806	she	236	“ I am , actually . ”
47925	47931	47915	47915	her	64	“ Hey . Mom around ? ”
47937	47956	47957	47957	She	64	“ She was , but she went up to change . She and Dad have dinner reservations somewhere . ”
47986	47989	47972	47972	she	64	“ So . ”
47996	47999	47990	47990	I	0	“ So ? ”
48000	48024	47994	47994	her	64	“ So last night I had a private tasting in the winery for some industry people , and it ran kind of late . ”
48025	48028	47990	47990	I	0	“ Oh ? ”
48054	48070	48044	48044	myself	0	“ By the time I was done cleaning up , it was close to midnight . ”
48071	48074	47994	47994	her	64	“ Mmm . ”
48075	48097	48044	48044	myself	0	“ And I went out to the parking lot to leave , and saw Mack ’s Tahoe in the staff lot . ”
48098	48101	48102	48102	I	0	“ Really ? ”
48110	48137	48102	48102	I	0	“ Really . The restaurant was long closed . The bar was closed . The offices were dark . Any idea where he might have been ? ”
48138	48141	48142	48142	I	0	“ No , ”
48161	48164	48165	48165	she	1011	“ Liar ! ”
48176	48196	48165	48165	she	1011	“ I can see it in your face ! He spent the night with you , did n’t he ? ”
48197	48200	48201	48201	I	0	“ Shhhhhhhh ! ”
48214	48222	48201	48201	I	0	“ Oh my God , he did ! ”
48241	48246	48223	48223	She	1011	“ Tell me everything . ”
48247	48260	48261	48261	I	0	“ Get down from there before Mom comes down and sees you . ”
48278	48284	48285	48285	She	1011	“ And lower your voice . ”
48298	48301	48289	48289	herself	1011	“ Well ? ”
48318	48326	48327	48327	Chloe	64	“ Okay , yes . He did . ”
48330	48335	48327	48327	Chloe	64	“ I knew it ! ”
48336	48354	48302	48302	I	0	“ But you ca n’t say anything to anyone . I do n’t want to broadcast it . ”
48355	48366	48367	48367	She	1011	“ Broadcast what , that you ’re fucking the CFO ? ”
48370	48381	48367	48367	She	1011	“ Ca n’t imagine why . So how was it ? ”
48390	48393	48397	48397	she	1011	“ Magical . ”
48402	48435	48397	48397	she	1011	“ You ’re not going to be able to keep this a secret for long , you know . The look on your face is a dead giveaway you ’re in love . ”
48436	48445	48446	48446	I	0	“ I never said I was in love , ”
48475	48482	48483	48483	She	1011	“ Whatever you say , sis . ”
49237	49300	49229	49229	I	0	“ Hey Mack , it ’s me . Um , Frannie . I ’m at your house , I thought we said seven , but maybe I got the time wrong ? Anyway , I hope everything ’s okay . Give me a call when you can . I guess I ’ll … just head back home . I ’ve got groceries . ”
49635	49638	49639	49639	I	0	“ Hi , ”
49643	49648	49649	49649	She	47	“ Come on in . ”
49678	49689	49669	49669	she	47	“ What ’s going on ? Where have you been ? ”
49690	49697	49698	49698	I	0	“ At the ER with Winnie , ”
49709	49717	49706	49706	her	47	“ Oh no ! Is she okay ? ”
49718	49751	49669	49669	she	47	“ Yeah . She fell down the stairs at my sister ’s house . Knocked a tooth out and split her lip . Luckily , it was a baby tooth , but … ”
49760	49777	49756	49756	I	0	“ There was a lot of blood and she needed stitches . She was pretty terrified . ”
49778	49787	49788	49788	Her	47	“ Oh my God . That ’s awful . ”
49795	49805	49788	49788	Her	47	“ The poor thing . Where is she now ? ”
49806	49821	49756	49756	I	0	“ She ’s in bed upstairs . We got home about twenty minutes ago . ”
49822	49828	49756	49756	I	0	“ And the other kids ? ”
49829	49845	49846	49846	I	0	“ Still at my sister ’s in Petoskey . Frannie , I ’m so sorry , ”
49861	49872	49846	49846	I	0	“ This day has turned into such a fucking disaster . ”
49873	49886	49756	49756	I	0	“ It ’s okay , but … why did n’t you call ? ”
49887	49958	49756	49756	I	0	“ I ca n’t find my fucking phone . I do n’t even remember where I had it last . I know my sister called me on it , frantic and crying , and then I jumped in the car , but I do n’t know if I had it with me or not . I did n’t even realize it was missing until I was already at the ER . ”
49959	49966	49846	49846	I	0	“ Did you check the car ? ”
49967	50008	49756	49756	I	0	“ Yeah , just a few minutes ago . But it was dark in the garage , and I did n’t want to leave Winn alone upstairs too long . I ’ll search again tomorrow when it ’s light out . ”
50009	50018	50019	50019	She	1057	“ Oh , Mack . I ’m sorry . ”
50031	50044	50019	50019	She	1057	“ I feel like such an asshole for doing this to you . ”
50062	50082	50045	50045	I	0	“ This is exactly what I was talking about . This is the shit that ’s going to happen . ”
50083	50112	50047	50047	my	0	“ Hush . You ’re not an asshole . You ’re a dad . I get it . It ’s not like you stood me up on purpose . ”
50113	50157	50045	50045	I	0	“ No , but it still sucks . Want to come in for a beer ? I know it ’s not the night we planned , but now that you ’re here , I ’d love it if you could stay a little . ”
50158	50161	50162	50162	She	1057	“ Sure . ”
50202	50270	50184	50184	I	0	“ It ’s so fucking scary when something happens to one of them . There ’s nothing worse than seeing your child in pain and being helpless to make it better . And it was worse because I was n’t there when it happened . I feel so guilty , especially because I ’d been so glad to have them out of the house for the night . ”
50285	50313	50276	50276	her	47	“ You should n’t feel guilty , Mack . You take care of them twenty - four - seven . Anybody would be glad for a break . ”
50314	50318	50321	50321	I	0	“ I guess . ”
50356	50399	50400	50400	I	0	“ Then once she ’d been treated and my head was clear , all I could think about was you out there in the cold , knocking on the door and waiting for me to answer . I let you down too . ”
50412	50418	50419	50419	She	47	“ Do you have frostbite ? ”
50422	50433	50419	50419	She	47	“ No , silly . I ’m tougher than that . ”
50443	50452	50434	50434	I	0	“ I was really looking forward to tonight . ”
50453	50461	50462	50462	She	47	“ Me too . But life happens . ”
50473	50534	50462	50462	She	47	“ I know what I ’m getting into , Mack . Okay ? I know there will be nights like this , where we have plans that fall through because one of the kids needs you . Yes , it ’s disappointing , but I understand , and I still want to be with you . You ’re worth it . ”
50556	50559	50552	50552	her	47	“ Thanks . ”
50576	50579	50570	50570	she	47	“ Hungry ? ”
50580	50583	50598	50598	she	47	“ Starving . ”
50584	50592	50598	50598	she	47	“ Let me get you some dinner . ”
50609	50625	50598	50598	she	47	“ I should have brought leftovers with me . I had a ton of food . ”
50626	50632	50633	50633	I	0	“ What did you make ? ”
50646	50656	50657	50657	I	0	“ Spinach and ricotta stuffed shells with meat sauce . ”
50663	50670	50657	50657	I	0	“ That sounds so fucking good . ”
50671	50675	50676	50676	She	47	“ It was . ”
50694	50707	50676	50676	She	47	“ I ’ll bring you some this week . I made plenty . ”
50708	50721	50722	50722	I	0	“ You do n’t have to make a real dinner for me , ”
50735	50754	50722	50722	I	0	“ I can eat something quick . I ’ll stick a frozen pizza in the oven or whatever . ”
50755	50762	50763	50763	She	47	“ No , you wo n’t . ”
50771	50797	50763	50763	She	47	“ I enjoy cooking . When I ’m done with these sliders , if you still want a tasteless frozen pizza , be my guest . ”
50798	50801	50802	50802	I	0	“ Sliders ? ”
50822	50856	50857	50857	She	47	“ Mmhm . With roast beef and caramelized onions . Can you grab a can of beef broth from the pantry ? I ’m pretty sure I saw one in there last week . ”
50865	50893	50857	50857	She	47	“ Oh , and I ’ll write my number down on that notebook by the phone . That way it ’s there in case of an emergency . ”
50983	50995	50996	50996	I	0	“ You already know I think that ’s a great idea , ”
51007	51017	50996	50996	I	0	“ I ’ll help you any way I can . ”
51018	51021	51022	51022	She	47	“ Thanks . ”
51026	51053	51022	51022	She	47	“ I still have a lot of research to do , but I ’ve been working on it here and there over the last few days . ”
51054	51062	51063	51063	She	47	“ Have you talked to your parents ? ”
51066	51115	51063	51063	She	47	“ I brought it up with my mom and we argued about it . She trotted out her same old arguments about my health and the stress , blah blah blah . In the past , I ’ve always backed down , but this time I wo n’t . ”
51116	51126	51127	51127	She	47	“ What have you asked for in the past ? ”
51146	51169	51127	51127	She	47	“ Mostly I just wanted to be like other kids . Go to school . Run around at recess . Play soccer . ”
51180	51188	51170	51170	I	0	“ You did n’t go to school ? ”
51189	51194	51244	51244	her	47	“ I was homeschooled . ”
51195	51198	51244	51244	her	47	“ Ah . ”
51199	51232	51170	51170	I	0	“ Later I wanted to go away to college . Backpack around Europe like my sisters had . Do you know that I ’ve never even been out of the United States ? ”
51233	51236	51237	51237	I	0	“ No ? ”
51247	51263	51242	51242	She	47	“ No . I have a passport and everything , gathering dust in a drawer . ”
51271	51278	51264	51264	I	0	“ Where would you go first ? ”
51279	51282	51283	51283	She	47	“ Hmmm . ”
51294	51359	51283	51283	She	47	“ France . I ’ve always wanted to go to Paris , of course , but I ’d also like to visit other places . We had a French pastry chef at Cloverleigh years ago , before you came on , and he was from a little town in the Loire Valley that has the castle that inspired the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty . ”
51360	51364	51445	51445	her	47	“ Oh yeah ? ”
51365	51371	51372	51372	she	47	“ Yes . Château d’Ussé , ”
51379	51422	51372	51372	she	47	“ He ’d tell me all about it , and I ’d dream that one day he was going to pluck me from my humdrum life and whisk me away to his enchanted castle , where we ’d live happily ever after . ”
51435	51440	51426	51426	I	0	“ Did n’t happen ? ”
51448	51481	51443	51443	she	47	“ Alas , Jean - Gaspard did not prefer women . Eventually , he moved back to France , leaving me alone and heartbroken . But I learned a lot from him . ”
51482	51505	51506	51506	I	0	“ Well , I ’m no French pastry chef , but I have total confidence that you can start your own business . ”
51515	51529	51506	51506	I	0	“ Christ , that was good . Thanks for making dinner for me . ”
51530	51535	51536	51536	She	47	“ You ’re welcome . ”
51540	51598	51536	51536	She	47	“ The bride from the wedding at Cloverleigh last weekend offered to help me , did I tell you that ? She ’s a commercial real estate agent , and she said she sometimes invests in female - owned small businesses . When she gets back from her honeymoon , she ’s going to get in touch . ”
51599	51604	51605	51605	I	0	“ That ’s awesome , ”
51609	51626	51627	51627	She	47	“ See ? The universe wants you to do this . All signs point to success . ”
51630	51637	51627	51627	She	47	“ Maybe . We ’ll see . ”
51654	51662	51638	51638	I	0	“ I should go check on Winnie . ”
51674	51686	51638	51638	I	0	“ Yeah , it ’s late . I should get going . ”
51687	51702	51703	51703	I	0	“ Wait , do n’t go yet . I ’ll be right back down . ”
51917	51937	51938	51938	She	47	“ You ’re the best thing that ’s happened to me in a long time , you know that ? ”
51945	51952	51938	51938	She	47	“ That makes me feel good . ”
51953	51964	51965	51965	I	0	“ And I wish you did n’t have to leave . ”
51970	51991	51965	51965	I	0	“ Me too . But it ’s late , and you ’ve got — Mack … what are you doing ? ”
52041	52046	52047	52047	I	0	“ Do n’t go , ”
52059	52067	52047	52047	I	0	“ Stay with me a while longer . ”
52098	52103	52104	52104	she	47	“ Oh , God , ”
52107	52113	52104	52104	she	47	“ That feels so good . ”
52197	52209	52210	52210	I	0	“ You want to come for me , do n’t you ? ”
52217	52232	52210	52210	I	0	“ You want to come for me right here , standing at the window . ”
52267	52272	52273	52273	she	47	“ Mack , stop , ”
52277	52283	52273	52273	she	47	“ Someone could see in . ”
52284	52309	52321	52321	I	0	“ If there was anyone in my yard at this time of night , I ’d break his fucking neck with my bare hands . ”
52328	52340	52321	52321	I	0	“ You ’re not going anywhere until I make you come . ”
52341	52344	52321	52321	I	0	“ But — ”
52345	52348	52349	52349	She	47	“ Shhh . ”
52387	52406	52407	52407	I	0	“ I ’ll stop as soon as I make that sweet little pussy come all over my fingers , ”
52418	52462	52407	52407	I	0	“ As soon as I hear you make that sound — the soft little moan you make when I ’m fucking you , and my cock is so deep it hurts , and you feel me start to come , and your body — ”
52521	52525	52526	52526	I	0	“ Good girl , ”
52535	52542	52526	52526	I	0	“ Now let me taste you . ”
52577	52580	52581	52581	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
52587	52604	52581	52581	I	0	“ Do you know how hard you make me ? Do you want to feel it ? ”
52605	52608	52609	52609	she	47	“ Yes , ”
52612	52615	52609	52609	she	47	“ Please . ”
52669	52673	52674	52674	I	0	“ Fuck yes , ”

52837	52850	52851	52851	she	47	“ And I ca n’t believe we did that in your window , ”
52869	52875	52851	52851	she	47	“ Someone could have seen . ”
52876	52881	52882	52882	I	0	“ No one saw , ”
52886	52892	52893	52893	I	0	“ What about Mrs. Gardner ? ”
52896	52923	52893	52893	I	0	“ She ’d probably be thrilled . She ’s always threatening to set me up with a nice young lady that works at her beauty salon . ”
52924	52928	52884	52884	her	47	“ She is ? ”
52929	52957	52958	52958	I	0	“ Yeah . She tells me all the time how she was the one who got Stella and Woods together . She ’s pretty smug about it . ”
52978	52988	52958	52958	I	0	“ Sorry . Let me get you a towel . ”
52989	52994	52995	52995	she	47	“ It ’s okay , ”
53008	53015	52995	52995	she	47	“ I just need a minute . ”
53134	53137	53127	53127	she	47	“ Hi . ”
53150	53156	53138	53138	She	47	“ Hi . You okay ? ”
53157	53161	53127	53127	she	47	“ Of course . ”
53162	53168	53127	53127	she	47	“ Was I too mean ? ”
53169	53172	53173	53173	She	47	“ Mean ? ”
53176	53185	53173	53173	She	47	“ No . Why would you say that ? ”
53186	53192	53193	53193	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
53201	53221	53193	53193	I	0	“ Because you said to stop and I did n’t . I do n’t want to be that guy . ”
53227	53237	53224	53224	her	47	“ You ’re not that guy , believe me . ”
53238	53241	53242	53242	I	0	“ Good . ”
53255	53271	53272	53272	She	47	“ Actually , I like that you got bossy with me . It was hot . ”
53275	53291	53272	53272	She	47	“ Although you owe quite a bit of money to that swear jar over there . ”
53319	53344	53345	53345	She	47	“ Hush , little girl . If you want to be with me , you ’ll have to put up with my dirty mouth . ”
53348	53355	53356	53356	I	0	“ You know I like it . ”
53359	53381	53356	53356	I	0	“ God , I wish you could stay over . There are so many things I want to do to you . ”

53445	53454	53455	53455	she	47	“ You ’re not even wearing a coat , ”
53469	53476	53455	53455	she	47	“ You ’ll freeze out here . ”
53477	53482	53483	53483	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
53499	53508	53483	53483	I	0	“ But I am sick of this cold . ”
53509	53533	53455	53455	she	47	“ Me too . The snow ’s pretty and all , but enough is enough . I wish I could take a vacation . ”
53534	53538	53539	53539	I	0	“ Me too , ”
53547	53553	53539	53539	I	0	“ Somewhere hot and sunny . ”

53630	53640	53620	53620	She	47	“ Let ’s do it . Let ’s escape . ”
53644	53671	53672	53672	She	47	“ Sure . Somewhere between piano on Tuesdays , ballet on Thursdays , and the mother - daughter fashion show I ’ve agreed to be in . ”
53677	53687	53672	53672	She	47	“ What ? I have n’t heard about that . ”
53688	53691	53692	53692	I	0	“ Millie . ”
53697	53718	53692	53692	I	0	“ She asked her mother and her mother said no , so I felt bad and offered to do it . ”

53725	53735	53672	53672	She	47	“ The weekend after the wedding , I think . ”
53736	53744	53692	53692	I	0	“ That ’s so sweet of you . ”
53748	53766	53745	53745	She	47	“ If you really do n’t want to , I do n’t mind doing it with her . ”
53770	53812	53767	53767	I	0	“ You have no idea how tempted I am to say yes . But I promised her . I want her to know she ’s got one parent she can depend on . That not everyone she loves will abandon her . ”
53829	53839	53813	53813	She	47	“ You ’re a good man , Declan MacAllister . ”
53840	53844	53813	53813	She	47	“ I try . ”
53845	53882	53883	53883	I	0	“ I ’m off tomorrow . Need anything ? Want me to stay with Winnie while you go get the other two ? That way you do n’t have to drag her out in this cold . ”
53888	53909	53883	53883	I	0	“ You ’ve done so much for me already this week . You deserve one day off , at least . ”
53921	53934	53910	53910	She	47	“ My number is by the phone . You let me know . ”
53935	53941	53883	53883	I	0	“ Thanks . ’ Night . ”

54239	54258	54259	54259	He	104	“ Yes . I had to brush my own hair , and it was not nearly as nice . ”
54262	54304	54259	54259	He	104	“ I ’m sorry for the rush . She ’s in the living room watching cartoons . In about an hour , she can have another dose of Motrin . It ’s right there on the counter , already measured out . ”
54305	54308	54220	54220	He	104	“ Okay . ”
54309	54332	54333	54333	He	104	“ If she ’s hungry , she can have some lunch , but she had a tough time eating anything for breakfast . ”
54346	54360	54333	54333	He	104	“ I should be back before two . Call if you need anything . ”
54361	54373	54374	54374	I	0	“ Okay . Do n’t worry , she ’ll be fine . ”
54381	54391	54374	54374	I	0	“ I ’ll fix her some soup or something . ”
54392	54395	54396	54396	He	104	“ Thanks . ”
54454	54457	54440	54440	I	0	“ Really ? ”
54463	54470	54458	54458	Her	51	“ It ’s a real place ? ”
54479	54482	54471	54471	I	0	“ Yes . ”
54483	54489	54490	54490	she	51	“ Is the story real ? ”
54493	54496	54497	54497	I	0	“ Definitely , ”
54500	54512	54497	54497	I	0	“ I want to marry a prince , do n’t you ? ”
54518	54521	54513	54513	I	0	“ Definitely . ”
54586	54592	54593	54593	Mack	104	“ How ’s she doing ? ”
54605	54610	54611	54611	I	0	“ She ’s fine , ”
54636	54654	54627	54627	Millie	49	“ You said you ’d teach me how to do Dutch braids in my hair , remember ? ”
54655	54661	54664	54664	Felicity	50	“ I want braids too , ”
54671	54690	54666	54666	Millie	49	“ You do n’t even have enough hair . And it ’s all hacked up in the front . ”
54714	54726	54727	54727	I	0	“ I think you have enough hair for braids , Felicity , ”
54731	54745	54727	54727	I	0	“ I can do it — they’ll just be short at the ends . ”
54746	54757	54701	54701	Mack	104	“ Yay ! Daddy , can Frannie stay a little ? ”
54758	54765	54766	54766	he	104	“ That ’s up to Frannie , ”
54769	54790	54791	54791	I	0	“ If she wants to spend more time in this loony bin , I ’m not gon na stop her . ”
54794	54808	54791	54791	I	0	“ I like this loony bin . I can stay a little longer . ”
54848	54858	54859	54859	I	0	“ Hey , I ’m going to head out , ”
54863	54870	54859	54859	I	0	“ Unless you need anything else . ”
54871	54876	54912	54912	he	104	“ I ’m good . ”
54877	54887	54912	54912	he	104	“ What about this week ? The usual schedule ? ”
54888	54901	54859	54859	I	0	“ Yeah . I ca n’t believe the weekend is over already . ”
54919	54969	54912	54912	he	104	“ But I spoke with Mrs. Ingersoll on the ride to Petoskey , and it turns out the break was n’t as bad as she thought . She ’s in a cast , but her daughter can help with the driving and she can watch the girls this week . ”
54970	54976	54912	54912	he	104	“ That ’s good news . ”
54977	55000	55010	55010	he	104	“ Hell yes , it is . I ’d have been fucked without her this week . And without you last week . ”
55023	55036	55010	55010	he	104	“ For everything extra you did , although it ’s not enough . ”
55044	55054	55037	55037	I	0	“ I do n’t want your money , Mack . ”
55055	55060	55061	55061	He	104	“ Please take it . ”
55066	55090	55061	55061	He	104	“ You spend so much of your time making my life easier , and I ca n’t give you more of my time . ”

55117	55132	55113	55113	I	0	“ We ’re friends . And friends do n’t pay each other for favors . ”

55181	55185	55174	55174	he	104	“ Hey what ? ”
55246	55252	55253	55253	he	104	“ We are not friends , ”
55357	55365	55341	55342	my mother	236	“ the old part of the house , ”
55467	55470	55471	55471	she	64	“ So , ”
55479	55483	55471	55471	she	64	“ Any news ? ”
55502	55513	55491	55491	I	0	“ I saw him last night . And again today . ”
55518	55528	55491	55491	I	0	“ Jeez . So it ’s serious , huh ? ”
55529	55545	55547	55547	I	0	“ Today I was only watching the girls . Last night was more of a … ”
55561	55566	55567	55567	Chloe	64	“ A romantic interlude . ”
55578	55592	55567	55567	Chloe	64	“ What the hell is a romantic interlude ? Does it involve sex ? ”
55593	55600	55601	55601	I	0	“ In this case , yes . ”
55615	55620	55601	55601	I	0	“ In the kitchen . ”
55629	55639	55621	55621	Chloe	64	“ Seriously ? Kitchen sex ? I ’m impressed . ”
55640	55643	55644	55644	I	0	“ Shhhhh . ”
55663	55675	55653	55653	April	59	“ It was sort of spontaneous . Winnie was asleep upstairs . ”
55697	55706	55707	55707	she	64	“ Oh my God , poor little thing , ”
55731	55743	55720	55720	She	64	“ Must be hard raising three girls all on his own . ”
55744	55748	55749	55749	I	0	“ It is , ”
55752	55784	55749	55749	I	0	“ He ’s worried that he does n’t have enough time for me . But I keep telling him I ’m not needy . I just want to be with him . ”
55785	55790	55791	55791	April	59	“ Be with who ? ”
55817	55820	55821	55821	I	0	“ Um , ”
55839	55849	55826	55826	her	59	“ Something is up with you two . Spill . ”
55888	55905	55878	55878	she	309	“ Okay , if I tell you , you have to promise to keep it quiet . ”
55906	55916	55917	55917	I	0	“ Of course . Tell me who he is ! ”
55920	55923	55917	55917	I	0	“ Mack . ”
55935	55944	55930	55930	she	59	“ I knew it ! I was right ! “
55947	55951	55930	55930	she	59	” I hushed . “
55983	55984	55930	55930	she	59	” “

56028	56044	56015	56015	kids	2015	” my mother asked , carrying a bowl of green beans into the dining room . “
56051	56056	56045	56045	Ryan	54	” April said quickly . “
56076	56084	56063	56063	she	59	” I gave her a grateful look . “

56101	56292	56293	56293	Frannie	104	” She gave me a wink and we all went into the kitchen to help bring out the food . About halfway through dinner , the subject of Ryan and Stella ’s wedding came up again . While April listed some of the details for Chloe and my mom , my mind wandered a little . I imagined what it would be like to plan my own wedding , what colors I ’d choose , how many guests I ’d invite , what I ’d wear . I ’d never really thought about it in great detail before , but now I pictured an intimate outdoor ceremony beside the barn at Cloverleigh and saw myself drifting down the aisle on a gorgeous summer evening to the sounds of classical guitar . Waiting for me under the rustic arch overlooking the vineyard was Mack , and in front of me walked his three girls , strewing rose petals in my path . He looked gorgeous in a charcoal gray suit with a sapphire blue tie that matched his eyes , and when he saw me for the first time , he — “
56295	56316	56293	56293	Frannie	104	” my mother said , as if it was n’t the first time she ’d tried to get my attention . “
56335	56336	56324	56324	I	0	” “
56341	56358	56324	56324	I	0	” Flustered , I picked up the bowl of roasted potatoes and handed them to her . “
56367	56373	56359	56359	I	0	” April smiled at me . “
56396	56403	56404	56404	she	1130	” she explained to my parents , “

56428	56438	56404	56404	she	1130	” Chloe said , kicking me under the table . “
56461	56482	56483	56483	We	1135	” I took a sip of wine for courage and was setting my glass down as my mother spoke up . “
56505	56509	56489	56489	I	0	” she said . “
56547	56548	56541	56541	she	1130	” “

56568	56579	56551	56551	I	0	” I said , sitting up taller in my chair . “
56592	56593	56551	56551	I	0	” “
56613	56625	56636	56636	you	96	” Mom gave Chloe a look like she should know better . “
56641	56654	56636	56636	you	96	” My father looked at me thoughtfully as he chewed and swallowed . “
56660	56661	56636	56636	you	96	” “
56666	56678	56636	56636	you	96	” I said , nervously twisting my hands in my lap . “
56684	56685	56686	56686	Frannie	104	” “
56710	56716	56717	56717	Mom	74	” my mother went on . “
56727	56752	56719	56719	they	1142	” I looked her in the eye and spoke confidently , so she ’d see I was n’t going to back down this time . “
56759	56769	56770	56770	John	96	” she insisted , picking up her wine glass . “
56779	56780	56770	56770	John	96	” “
56790	56800	56787	56787	I	0	” My dad wiped his mouth with his napkin . “

56886	56892	56893	56893	I	0	” I shook my head . “

56944	56945	56918	56918	Frannie	104	” “
56962	56971	56918	56918	Frannie	104	” She waved a hand , dismissing me . “
56988	56989	56918	56918	Frannie	104	” “
57000	57034	56993	56993	I	0	” At my heated tone , the entire table went still and silent . I lowered my voice — I wanted to sound calm and self - assured , not petulant and angry . “
57050	57051	57044	57044	I	0	” “
57057	57066	57044	57044	I	0	” My mother looked a bit nervous now . “
57081	57114	57044	57044	I	0	” I had n’t planned on threatening to move out , but I wanted them to know I was serious . If that ’s what it took , I ’d do it . “

57244	57245	57221	57221	you	96	” “
57255	57260	57261	57261	Frannie	104	” he said reasonably . “
57263	57270	57271	57271	you	104	” my mother appealed to me , “
57285	57286	57287	57287	I	0	” “
57358	57377	57378	57378	I	0	” Unable to eat anymore , I stood up , my half - full plate in my hands . “

57442	57498	57435	57435	I	0	” And with that , I walked into the kitchen on legs shaking with nerves and exhilaration , put my plate on the counter , and left through the back door . I had n’t planned on making a declaration of independence at Sunday dinner , but I could n’t help feeling damn good about it .
58050	58060	58043	58043	She	1177	“ I said I ’d text you dirty things . ”

58259	58289	58251	58251	She	1177	“ No . You like your mouth on me too . I lie here and touch all the places on my body where I want to feel your tongue . ”

59251	59260	59261	59261	she	49	“ What about the night of the wedding ? ”
59265	59280	59261	59261	she	49	“ Yeah , my folks will be here then . That ’s a possibility . ”
59281	59294	59295	59295	she	49	“ Do n’t worry , I wo n’t get my hopes up , ”
59299	59306	59295	59295	she	49	“ It ’s just an idea . ”
59307	59312	59313	59313	I	0	“ I like it . ”
59316	59325	59313	59313	I	0	“ Let me see what I can do . ”
59326	59329	59330	59330	She	49	“ Okay . ”
59336	59346	59330	59330	She	49	“ You tired me out from clear across town . ”
59347	59362	59313	59313	I	0	“ Here ’s where I make a joke about how big my dick is . ”
59363	59369	59370	59370	she	49	“ It ’s no joke , ”
59373	59395	59370	59370	she	49	“ And I ’ll be thinking about it every night about this time until I can have you to myself again . ”
59396	59409	59313	59313	I	0	“ You really do want to torture me , do n’t you ? ”
59410	59413	59414	59414	She	49	“ Yes . ”
59418	59447	59414	59414	She	49	“ And no . I just want to be with you , that ’s all . I know this is brand new , but it feels really good . ”
59448	59452	59313	59313	I	0	“ It does . ”
59453	59490	59313	59313	I	0	“ So forgive me if I get a little carried away . I ’ve had these feelings for you for so long , I hardly remember a time when you did n’t make my heart pound . ”
59491	59494	59313	59313	I	0	“ Really ? ”
59495	59510	59511	59511	I	0	“ Really . But I was convinced you only saw me as a kid . ”
59514	59562	59511	59511	I	0	“ Nope . I mean , I thought you were too young and way off limits , but I remember last year at the Christmas party wanting to throw you over my shoulder , take you back to my office , and fuck you on my desk . ”
59563	59566	59567	59567	she	1185	“ What ? ”
59570	59576	59567	59567	she	1185	“ You never said anything ! ”
59577	59586	59587	59587	I	0	“ What the hell would I have said ? ”
59592	59610	59587	59587	I	0	“ Your parents were in the room . And my kids . And everyone we work with . ”
59611	59630	59511	59511	I	0	“ I guess . But jeez . I wish I would have known . You hid it well . ”
59631	59648	59511	59511	I	0	“ I had to . I told myself it was wrong to want you that way . ”
59649	59657	59658	59658	she	1185	“ Have you changed your mind yet ? ”
59662	59669	59658	59658	she	1185	“ That ’s a good question . ”
59676	59716	59670	59670	I	0	“ Yes and no . I ’m still worried about what your parents will think . And I worry about what will happen when you realize I ’m not worth all the shit you have to put up with . ”
59717	59725	59726	59726	she	1185	“ What do you think will happen ? ”
59729	59741	59742	59742	I	0	“ You ’ll move on because you know you deserve better , ”
59746	59760	59742	59742	I	0	“ And I ’ll let you , because I ’ll know it too . ”
59769	59802	59766	59766	I	0	“ If that ’s what you think , then you do n’t know me very well , Declan MacAllister . So I guess it ’s up to me to prove you wrong . ”
59814	59817	59811	59811	her	1185	“ Okay . ”
59818	59825	59826	59826	She	1185	“ I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
59831	59834	59826	59826	She	1185	“ Goodnight . ”
59835	59838	59811	59811	her	1185	“ Goodnight . ”
60111	60115	60117	60117	she	1185	“ good morning , ”
60269	60279	60261	60261	her	1185	“ Hey , you . How ’s your day ? ”
60280	60283	60284	60284	she	1185	“ Great , ”
60294	60299	60284	60284	she	1185	“ Got a minute ? ”
60300	60304	60305	60305	I	0	“ Of course . ”
60319	60328	60329	60329	She	1185	“ Come on in . Take a seat . ”
60365	60369	60348	60348	I	0	“ But first . ”
60458	60463	60454	60454	I	0	“ We better stop . ”
60464	60467	60468	60468	she	1185	“ Right , ”
60503	60511	60483	60483	I	0	“ What can I do for you ? ”
60529	60561	60517	60517	she	1185	“ Mrs. Radley , the bride who said she was interested in helping me start a business , just dropped this off . She was in a hurry , but look . ”
60715	60726	60708	60708	Frannie	109	“ This is awesome . You have to call her . ”
60727	60731	60732	60732	She	109	“ You think ? ”
60738	60774	60732	60732	She	109	“ I want to — I’m just nervous . I have n’t gotten a chance to tell you this yet , but I told my parents what I want to do Sunday night at dinner . ”
60775	60785	60786	60786	She	109	“ Good for you . What did they say ? ”
60791	60845	60786	60786	She	109	“ They gave me a bunch of shit about it , especially my mother . But I did n’t back down . I told them it ’s what I want to do , and it ’s time I start making decisions based on what I think I ’m capable of , not them . ”
60856	60867	60846	60846	I	0	“ I ’m impressed . How ’d they take it ? ”
60873	60912	60868	60868	She	109	“ Not awesome . I threatened to move out too , which I had n’t planned on doing , but I was getting pretty fired up about wanting my independence . My dad suggested I start paying rent . ”
60918	60924	60913	60913	I	0	“ What did you say ? ”
60925	61006	60915	60915	my	0	“ I said thanks but no thanks . Not that I would n’t pay rent , of course , and I will , but that that ’s not what I meant . All my sisters got the chance to go to school , travel , accomplish their goals . They were n’t held back , and I do n’t want to be held back either anymore . If I fail , I fail , but I ’ve got to try . ”
61007	61052	61053	61053	She	1208	“ As a father , you ’re scaring the piss out of me right now . As someone who wants to see you kick ass out in the world , I ’m happy as fuck and I want you to go call this woman . ”
61056	61064	61053	61053	She	1208	“ Thanks . I ’m going to . ”
61084	61092	61065	61065	I	0	“ Let me know how it goes . ”
61093	61098	61099	61099	she	1208	“ I ’m nervous , ”
61109	61121	61099	61099	she	1208	“ What if she asks questions I have no answers to ? ”
61122	61129	61065	61065	I	0	“ Hey . Listen to me . ”
61147	61178	61137	61137	I	0	“ You are smart , talented , and persistent . If you do n’t know the answer to something , you ’ll find it . And you ’re not alone . ”
61179	61182	61183	61183	I	0	“ No ? ”
61188	61222	61185	61185	my	0	“ You ’ve got your sisters , you ’ve got an ally in this Radley woman , and you have me . I ’ll be here for you every step of the way . ”
61228	61232	61223	61223	Her	1208	“ You will ? ”
61233	61236	61237	61237	She	1208	“ Yes . ”
61254	61263	61239	61239	her	1208	“ Tell me again that I have you . ”
61264	61269	61274	61274	she	1208	“ You have me . ”
61281	61288	61274	61274	she	1208	“ That ’s all I want . ”
61410	61414	61405	61405	I	0	“ Come in . ”
61427	61440	61424	61424	her	64	“ Hey , what do you think of this ad copy for — ”
61498	61504	61505	61505	Chloe	64	“ Am I interrupting something ? ”
61511	61514	61515	61515	we	1213	“ No , ”
61524	61531	61521	61521	She	64	“ You guys are horrible liars . ”
61532	61538	61539	61539	Frannie	109	“ I was just going , ”
61567	61575	61551	61551	She	109	“ I ’ll talk to you later . ”
61576	61579	61580	61580	Chloe	64	“ Okay , ”
61595	61598	61599	61599	she	64	“ Well , ”
61602	61611	61612	61612	I	0	“ It ’s not what it looks like , ”
61621	61632	61616	61616	I	0	“ Actually , it ’s exactly what it looks like . ”
61638	61665	61633	61633	Chloe	64	“ Do n’t look so scared , Mack . I think it ’s fantastic . Frannie needs somebody like you . It ’s good for her . ”
61674	61697	61698	61698	She	64	“ I do n’t know about that . I keep thinking your dad is going to come after me with a shotgun . ”
61709	61757	61706	61706	her	64	“ Nah . It ’ll take him all of two seconds to see how crazy Frannie is about you . And what Frannie wants , Frannie gets . All she has to do is turn those big green eyes at him , and he ’s a goner . ”
61765	61773	61759	61759	I	0	“ Yeah . I know the feeling . ”
61913	61916	61903	61903	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
61926	61938	61917	61917	She	110	“ Hi , Mrs. Radley , this is Frannie Sawyer from — ”
61939	61952	61903	61903	I	0	“ Frannie Sawyer , how are you ? You got my note ? ”
61953	61966	61903	61903	I	0	“ Yes . I’m — I was really glad you came in . ”
61967	62036	62037	62037	She	1222	“ Well , I ’m telling you , Frannie , this is meant . To . Be . My entire honeymoon , I kept thinking of what I could do for you , and then the very morning I get back to the office , I got a phone call from the daughter of a friend of my mother ’s . They were in pageants together or something . ”
62040	62101	62037	62037	She	1222	“ Anyway , this girl , her name is Natalie Haas , has owned this little coffee shop downtown for years and it ’s doing really well , but she ’s got a two - year - old son and she ’s pregnant again , and apparently she runs another restaurant as well , so she needs to cut back . ”
62102	62110	62111	62111	I	0	“ What ’s the name of it ? ”
62122	62126	62111	62111	I	0	“ Coffee Darling . ”
62127	62135	62136	62136	I	0	“ Oh , I know that place ! ”
62139	62151	62136	62136	I	0	“ It ’s adorable . That ’s the shop for sale ? ”
62152	62205	62206	62206	My	0	“ Well , she ’s not sure if she should sell the building , which she does own , or try to find a reliable tenant . She was looking for advice . Her dream scenario , actually , is to find someone to partner with . I thought of you immediately . ”
62213	62221	62206	62206	My	0	“ Did you tell her about me ? ”
62222	62268	62111	62111	I	0	“ Not yet . But I just could n’t help thinking that with her experience , and all the equipment in place , plus a built - in clientele , and your fresh new ideas and youth and energy — I see a home run . ”
62269	62277	62278	62278	I	0	“ I ’d love to meet her , ”
62282	62327	62278	62278	I	0	“ Great ! I ’ll set up a meeting . In the meantime , why do n’t you see if you can get down there and check out the spot ? Look at it with your vision in mind and see what you think . ”
62333	62340	62328	62328	I	0	“ I ’ll definitely do that . ”
62341	62366	62278	62278	I	0	“ Perfect . I have to run , dear , but I ’ll be in touch as soon as I connect with Natalie again . ”
62367	62373	62374	62374	I	0	“ Thank you so much , ”
62862	62871	62852	62853	My father	2124	“ Hey , peanut . Come on in . ”
62872	62880	62908	62909	my mother	236	“ Hi , Dad . Mom around ? ”
62881	62895	62898	62898	him	2124	“ Yeah . She ’s in the kitchen harassing me about retirement again . ”
62921	62926	62927	62927	I	0	“ Hey , Mom , ”
62934	62938	62927	62927	I	0	“ Smells good . ”
62939	62946	62947	62947	she	236	“ I made chicken and rice , ”
62950	62959	62947	62947	she	236	“ Do you want to eat with us ? ”
62960	62963	62964	62964	I	0	“ Sure . ”
63059	63073	63074	63074	I	0	“ I thought we might talk again about my opening a pastry shop , ”
63077	63083	63074	63074	I	0	“ I have some news . ”
63105	63108	63103	63103	Mack	104	“ Hello ? ”
63109	63123	63087	63087	My	0	“ Hey . Sorry it took so long for me to call back . ”
63124	63129	63130	63130	I	0	“ That ’s okay . ”
63142	63148	63130	63130	I	0	“ How was your night ? ”
63149	63154	63156	63156	he	104	“ It was fine . ”
63160	63181	63156	63156	he	104	“ I took them to therapy , then out for some dinner , but Winnie is still struggling to eat . ”
63182	63186	63130	63130	I	0	“ Poor thing . ”
63187	63235	63236	63236	I	0	“ Then Felicity freaked out that she did n’t have enough valentines for her entire class , so I had to run out to the drugstore . And Millie ’s eye - rolling is out of control , but all in all , not a terrible night . ”
63239	63268	63236	63236	I	0	“ Do n’t take it to heart . She ’s at that age . Eye - rolling is sort of an automatic reaction to anything your dad says . ”
63274	63285	63236	63236	I	0	“ I ’m not looking forward to the teenage years . ”
63286	63302	63130	63130	I	0	“ Maybe it wo n’t be so bad . I was n’t a sassy teenager . ”
63303	63306	63130	63130	I	0	“ No ? ”
63307	63348	63349	63349	I	0	“ No , but that might have been a reaction to Chloe . She was as sassy as they come , and I saw how my parents struggled . I think I was trying to be the anti - Chloe . ”
63352	63358	63349	63349	I	0	“ I was a pleaser . ”
63359	63364	63365	63365	I	0	“ You still are . ”
63368	63373	63365	63365	I	0	“ But guess what ? ”
63374	63377	63349	63349	I	0	“ What ? ”
63378	63402	63349	63349	I	0	“ I talked to Maxima Radley , and it went really well . Then I went down to tell my parents about it . ”
63403	63406	63349	63349	I	0	“ And ? ”
63407	63449	63349	63349	I	0	“ And I convinced them that if they really loved me , they would support me in this . I told them that I was doing this with or without their support , but I ’d much prefer to have it . ”
63450	63456	63349	63349	I	0	“ What did they say ? ”
63457	63493	63349	63349	I	0	“ My dad asked me some practical questions . My mother mostly gave me the silent treatment . But in the end , it was my father who talked her into easing up on me . ”
63494	63499	63349	63349	I	0	“ Really ? How ? ”
63500	63593	63349	63349	I	0	“ It was pretty incredible . He said he ’d been thinking about it all last night and all day today . He reminded her of how her family — which was wealthy and old money — had treated her when she announced she wanted to marry a guy she ’d met at college who ran a family farm up north . And how they told her it was beneath her to run an inn . And how everyone told them they were crazy to buy more land and plant a vineyard . ”
63607	63692	63601	63601	I	0	“ Then he took her hand and reminded her how they ’d always agreed that raising children was the hardest , most important job they ’d ever do … but that the job was over . That even though they ’re still parents , their children were all grown , and they had to trust that they ’d raised smart , kind , responsible people unafraid to face the world and chase their dreams . Otherwise , he said , they ’d have failed . ”
63693	63702	63349	63349	I	0	“ Wow . How ’d she take it ? ”
63703	63780	63781	63781	He	1252	“ She shed a few tears . But in the end , she came around . She admitted that maybe her clinging to me had more to do with herself than with me . Her identity for so many years has been wrapped up in being an overprotective mother . Once that ’s gone , she fears feeling lost . She does n’t know what the next phase of her life is supposed to look like . ”
63787	63794	63781	63781	He	1252	“ I can relate to that . ”
63795	63838	63349	63349	I	0	“ My dad told her it can look like anything she wants it to . He said maybe they should stop talking about traveling more and do it . Enjoy the years they ’ve got left while they still feel young enough . ”
63839	63845	63846	63846	I	0	“ What did she say ? ”
63849	63921	63846	63846	I	0	“ She said three things . One , she ’d love to travel more , especially to see her grandchildren . Two , she said it only works if he agrees to step back from work a bit , so he should really get a plan in place for his retirement . And three , she said she wants more grandchildren in her life . Then she gave me a look . ”
63922	63931	63349	63349	I	0	“ A look ? What kind of look ? ”
63932	63952	63953	63953	He	1253	“ A look that says , Is there any hope of you giving me a grandchild in the future ? ”
63956	63973	63953	63953	He	1253	“ You ’ve got three other sisters . How come the pressure ’s all on you ? ”
63974	64027	63349	63349	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Maybe she figures April would have started a family if she ’d wanted one by now ? Or that Meg is too much of a career woman ? Or that Chloe ca n’t be trusted to raise kids that are n’t little hellions like she was ? ”
64028	64035	64042	64042	I	0	“ Do you even want kids ? ”
64036	64041	64042	64042	I	0	“ Oh , definitely , ”
64045	64085	64042	64042	I	0	“ I ’ve always wanted them . And I ’ve asked the doctor if there ’s any reason I might have a difficult time because of my heart , and he said no . I can absolutely have kids . ”
64086	64094	64095	64095	I	0	“ That ’s … that ’s good . ”
64108	64120	64121	64121	He	1254	“ Do n’t worry . I ’m not in a rush . ”
64124	64130	64121	64121	He	1254	“ That ’s even better . ”
64168	64195	64160	64161	Natalie Haas	111	“ Oh yeah , I know that place . I think she was a Nixon . Sylvia and I graduated with her older sister , Jillian . ”
64196	64210	64211	64211	I	0	“ Really ? Cool , I ’ll mention that when I meet her . ”
64224	64243	64211	64211	I	0	“ I do n’t want to jinx myself , but I have such a good feeling about this . ”
64244	64247	64160	64161	Natalie Haas	111	“ Good . ”
64248	64264	64160	64161	Natalie Haas	111	“ I ’m going to go check out the space as soon as I can . ”
64265	64275	64211	64211	I	0	“ I ’m really happy for you , Frannie . ”

64873	64883	64884	64884	I	0	“ And what are you laughing at , huh ? ”
64895	64914	64884	64884	I	0	“ Maybe I will take you up on that offer to be in this show instead of me . ”
64915	64919	64920	64920	she	51	“ No way , ”
64923	64929	64920	64920	she	51	“ You made a promise . ”
64930	64935	64936	64936	Millie	49	“ That ’s right . ”
64950	64957	64936	64936	Millie	49	“ And it was your idea . ”
64958	64964	64965	64965	I	0	“ I need a beer , ”
64968	64975	64965	64965	I	0	“ I made dinner for you , ”
64984	64993	64976	64976	Frannie	104	“ It ’s in the oven keeping warm . ”
64994	65010	65011	65011	She	51	“ Is that what smells so good ? You did n’t have to do that . ”
65014	65026	65011	65011	She	51	“ It ’s just a casserole . Not a big deal . ”
65027	65041	64976	64976	Frannie	104	“ It is . And I appreciate it . Have the girls eaten ? ”
65042	65060	65011	65011	She	51	“ Yes , so I ’ll get going . Bye , girls . Happy Valentine ’s Day ! ”
65061	65067	65068	65068	they	1273	“ Happy Valentine ’s Day ! ”
65175	65181	65182	65182	she	51	“ What are you doing ? ”
65193	65207	65182	65182	she	51	“ I ’m stealing thirty seconds alone with you for Valentine ’s Day . ”
65215	65232	65233	65233	She	51	“ This is what it ’s like to be my valentine . Is n’t it romantic ? ”
65236	65239	65233	65233	She	51	“ Totally . ”
65240	65264	65302	65302	her	51	“ I wish we had some time alone . And I should have gotten something for you . Flowers or chocolate or something . ”
65265	65279	65233	65233	She	51	“ I do n’t want gifts , Mack . I just want you . ”
65280	65299	65300	65300	She	51	“ But I ca n’t even give you that . Not the way I want to , anyway . ”
65308	65315	65302	65302	her	51	“ Shut up and kiss me . ”
65358	65366	65367	65367	she	51	“ What are you doing in there ? ”
65370	65378	65379	65379	I	0	“ I was … changing a lightbulb , ”
65399	65407	65379	65379	I	0	“ Oh good . It works now . ”
65408	65414	65415	65415	Winnie	51	“ What was Frannie doing ? ”
65429	65434	65435	65435	Frannie	104	“ I was helping , ”
65450	65458	65435	65435	Frannie	104	“ Can you help him make dessert ? ”
65463	65475	65459	65459	Winnie	51	“ No , she ’s got things to do , Winn . ”

65946	65985	65941	65941	I	0	“ Um , they ’re for Frannie , actually . She ’s been so great with the kids , and she stayed late and made dinner yesterday … I just wanted to let her know I appreciate her . ”
65990	66021	65941	65941	I	0	“ How nice . She ’s not working this morning , but she ’s at home as far as I know . Why do n’t you bring them to her ? ”
66022	66029	66030	66030	I	0	“ Maybe I will , thanks . ”
66268	66271	66272	66272	she	84	“ Hey , ”
66279	66287	66272	66272	she	84	“ What are you doing up here ? ”

66304	66310	66301	66301	She	84	“ What ’s this for ? ”
66311	66322	66272	66272	she	84	“ For Valentine ’s Day . For everything you do . ”
66347	66360	66361	66361	She	84	“ You did n’t have to do that . But thank you . ”
66372	66388	66361	66361	She	84	“ I wish I ’d have known you were coming . I ’m a mess . ”
66389	66394	66395	66395	I	0	“ You ’re perfect . ”
66401	66416	66419	66419	she	84	“ But I do think even I could do a better bun than that . ”
66426	66434	66419	66419	she	84	“ Now you ’re just getting cocky . ”
66435	66444	66419	66419	she	84	“ Oh , I ’ve always been that . ”
66445	66451	66452	66452	she	84	“ Want to come in ? ”
66455	66466	66452	66452	she	84	“ Or do you have to get back to work ? ”
66467	66473	66474	66474	I	0	“ I should get back , ”

66499	66527	66494	66494	she	84	“ Okay . A few minutes , but that ’s really all I have . I ’m meeting with your dad and DeSantis in half an hour . ”
66528	66538	66541	66541	she	84	“ I promise to kick you out by then . ”
66558	66567	66568	66568	She	84	“ Let me grab a vase for these . ”
66593	66599	66582	66582	she	84	“ Awww . Thank you . ”
66600	66634	66582	66582	she	84	“ You ’re welcome . It ’s not much , but I wanted you to know I was thinking of you . And how lucky I am to have you in my life . ”
66635	66641	66582	66582	she	84	“ I feel the same . ”
66642	66657	66658	66658	Frannie	104	“ Your mom saw me with the flowers and asked who they were for . ”
66663	66670	66658	66658	Frannie	104	“ What did you tell her ? ”
66671	66677	66582	66582	she	84	“ The truth , actually . ”
66688	66692	66693	66693	She	84	“ You did ? ”
66710	66717	66700	66700	her	84	“ That makes me so happy ! ”

66742	66748	66749	66749	Frannie	104	“ Was my mother surprised ? ”
66752	66769	66749	66749	Frannie	104	“ Not as much as I thought she would be . She seemed fine with it . ”
66770	66775	66777	66777	she	84	“ I told you . ”
66781	66788	66777	66777	she	84	“ Mmm . You smell good . ”
66789	66802	66777	66777	she	84	“ You smell good too . I could eat you right now . ”
66964	66968	66958	66958	Frannie	104	“ Good timing . ”
66969	66982	66958	66958	Frannie	104	“ Does that mean you have to get out of this bed ? ”
66983	66988	66958	66958	Frannie	104	“ Yes , unfortunately . ”
66989	66997	66958	66958	Frannie	104	“ I do n’t want you to . ”
66998	67005	67008	67008	I	0	“ I ’ll come right back . ”
67059	67067	67068	67068	she	84	“ I only have a few minutes , ”
67077	67089	67068	67068	she	84	“ And so do you . What time is your meeting ? ”
67094	67108	67068	67068	she	84	“ Fuck ! I forgot about that . What time is it now ? ”
67109	67116	67068	67068	she	84	“ A few minutes to ten . ”
67117	67120	67121	67121	I	0	“ Shit ! ”
67133	67140	67121	67121	I	0	“ My meeting is at ten . ”
67151	67165	67141	67141	Frannie	104	“ Sorry . I guess I was supposed to boot you out sooner . ”
67189	67226	67227	67227	She	84	“ Yes . This is all your fault . If you had n’t smelled so good or been so fucking cute when you answered the door , I ’d have been on time for my meeting . ”
67250	67257	67260	67260	she	84	“ You ’re asking for it . ”
67269	67274	67275	67275	I	0	“ Hard and often . ”
67290	67304	67275	67275	I	0	“ Fuck , I have to go . I wish I did n’t . ”
67305	67309	67310	67310	She	84	“ Me too . ”
67323	67335	67310	67310	She	84	“ It ’s so nice to be alone with you again . ”
67336	67360	67275	67275	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . I feel bad we ca n’t be like normal people and do this during non - working hours . ”
67361	67366	67367	67367	She	84	“ It ’s okay . ”
67370	67380	67367	67367	She	84	“ It ’s kind of fun to sneak around . ”
67381	67395	67396	67396	I	0	“ Except I ’m late for a meeting with your dad right now , ”
67413	67425	67396	67396	I	0	“ And I look like I just got out of bed . ”
67453	67462	67463	67463	she	84	“ I ’ll see you at home tonight , ”
67476	67483	67463	67463	she	84	“ Thanks again for the flowers ! ”
67484	67489	67490	67490	I	0	“ You ’re welcome ! ”
67781	67786	67775	67775	Felicity	50	“ I miss Frannie . ”
67787	67791	67793	67793	Winnie	51	“ Me too , ”
67795	67802	67775	67775	Felicity	50	“ I wish she was here . ”
67803	67811	67812	67812	Millie	49	“ Can we call her , Dad ? ”
67820	67835	67815	67815	I	0	“ No , she ’s working tonight . We ’ll see her next week . ”
67836	67848	67849	67849	Winnie	51	“ Maybe she could come over tomorrow and do braids again , ”
67852	67860	67862	67862	Millie	49	“ And help me with my shirts , ”
67873	67879	67862	67862	Millie	49	“ I ’ll text her . ”
67880	67888	67889	67889	I	0	“ No , do n’t do that . ”
67912	67932	67910	67910	myself	0	“ Let ’s let her have the weekend to herself , okay ? She ’s probably tired of us . ”
68089	68117	68084	68084	she	49	“ Hi . Sorry I missed you . Chloe needed help tonight , so I ’m pouring wine at this stupid corporate thing in the tasting room . ”
68118	68132	68133	68133	She	49	“ Guess that means you ’re not going to talk dirty to me . ”
68136	68149	68133	68133	She	49	“ Probably not . Might be awkward . How was your day ? ”
68150	68157	68158	68158	I	0	“ Good . Nothing too exciting . ”
68166	68180	68158	68158	I	0	“ The girls missed you at dinner . They wanted to call you . ”
68181	68194	68133	68133	She	49	“ Awww . I ’m sorry . This weekend is crazy here . ”
68195	68207	68208	68208	I	0	“ I know . I told them you had to work . ”
68239	68246	68208	68208	I	0	“ I should let you go . ”
68247	68259	68216	68216	her	49	“ Okay . Give me a call tomorrow if you can ? ”
68260	68264	68265	68265	I	0	“ I will , ”
68393	68412	68414	68414	she	49	“ Yeah , it ’s supposed to be mother - daughter , but they said Daddy can participate . ”
68417	68431	68414	68414	she	49	“ We have to make our own outfits . Frannie is helping me . ”
68461	68471	68472	68472	Millie	49	“ Okay . I love you too . Bye . ”
68479	68488	68489	68489	she	49	“ Can I have a little screen time ? ”
68492	68496	68497	68497	She	49	“ Shower first . ”
68500	68504	68497	68497	She	49	“ Got it . ”
68519	68524	68505	68505	I	0	“ Hi , Mom . ”
68525	68534	68568	68568	my	0	“ Hi , sweetie . How are you ? ”
68535	68542	68568	68568	my	0	“ Good . Busy . You ? ”
68543	68553	68505	68505	I	0	“ Great . We ’re excited for our visit . ”
68554	68559	68568	68568	my	0	“ We are too . ”
68601	68606	68594	68594	I	0	“ You arrive tomorrow ? ”
68607	68635	68505	68505	I	0	“ Yes . We ’ll stay at Jodie ’s for two nights , then we ’ll drive down to you for three . Does that still work ? ”
68636	68671	68701	68701	her	236	“ Yeah , that ’s perfect . The wedding is n’t until Saturday , but I have the rehearsal Friday , and I ’m supposed to spend some time with Woods on Thursday night . ”
68672	68684	68701	68701	her	236	“ And who ’s the bride ? Do I know her ? ”
68685	68697	68701	68701	her	236	“ She ’s Ruth Gardner ’s granddaughter . Lives in Detroit . ”
68704	68717	68701	68701	her	236	“ Oh , I just love Ruthie Gardner . How is she ? ”
68718	68723	68701	68701	her	236	“ She ’s fine . ”
68724	68743	68744	68744	I	0	“ And what about you ? The girls told me it was quite a week . Poor Winnie ! ”
68747	68750	68744	68744	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
68751	68760	68701	68701	her	236	“ They all talked a lot about Frannie . ”
68773	68790	68744	68744	I	0	“ Yes . She ’s been helping out a lot . She ’s great with them . ”
68791	68798	68744	68744	I	0	“ Sounds like they adore her . ”
68799	68803	68744	68744	I	0	“ They do . ”
68804	68818	68744	68744	I	0	“ And it seems like she spends a lot of time with them . ”
68845	68875	68876	68877	My mother	236	“ Well , Miriam Ingersoll broke her leg a couple weeks ago , so Frannie had to fill in . They saw a little more of her than usual . ”
68880	68895	68876	68877	My mother	236	“ Oh , no ! Poor Miriam . Thank goodness you had extra help . ”
68902	68916	68896	68896	Her	236	“ I hear Frannie is doing more than just babysitting at your house . ”
68921	68928	68896	68896	Her	236	“ What ? Who said that ? ”
68929	68938	68896	68896	Her	236	“ Felicity said she ’s been cooking dinner . ”
68939	68942	68943	68943	I	0	“ Oh . ”
68948	68958	68943	68943	I	0	“ Yeah . Sometimes , if I work late . ”
68959	68967	68896	68896	Her	236	“ That ’s awfully nice of her . ”
68968	68976	68977	68977	I	0	“ She likes to cook for people , ”
68984	69001	68977	68977	I	0	“ And she lives alone , so she does n’t get to do it very often . ”
69002	69024	68896	68896	Her	236	“ How old is Frannie now ? Last time I saw her , she was probably close to Millie ’s age . ”
69025	69030	68896	68896	Her	236	“ Twenty - seven . ”
69031	69039	68977	68977	I	0	“ And you said she lives alone ? ”
69040	69043	68896	68896	Her	236	“ Yes . ”
69052	69057	69045	69045	I	0	“ Is she attractive ? ”
69058	69061	68977	68977	I	0	“ Mom . ”
69062	69073	69074	69074	she	1336	“ What ? I ’m just trying to picture her , ”
69085	69094	69078	69078	I	0	“ Yes . She ’s a pretty girl . ”
69095	69105	68977	68977	I	0	“ Is there something going on between you two ? ”
69106	69111	68977	68977	I	0	“ Jesus , Mom ! ”
69112	69152	69078	69078	I	0	“ I ’m only asking because I think you need to be very careful . The girls have been through so much and it could be confusing and hurtful for them to see you with another woman so soon . ”
69153	69157	68977	68977	I	0	“ I know . ”
69158	69233	68977	68977	I	0	“ I ’m not saying you have to be alone for the rest of your life , but they ’re just so young , and they ’ve still got to be traumatized about their mom running off with another man . Deep down they ’re probably afraid of losing you that way too . You want them to feel one hundred and ten percent certain they are the most important people in your life . ”
69234	69238	69239	69239	I	0	“ They do , ”
69242	69252	69239	69239	I	0	“ I do n’t need to be told this . ”
69253	69269	69270	69270	she	1337	“ And maybe it would be best not to take up with their beloved nanny , ”
69274	69297	69270	69270	she	1337	“ I mean , what happens if you two have a fight and she quits ? Then the girls lose her too . ”
69298	69310	68977	68977	I	0	“ And it would be my fault . I get it . ”
69311	69359	68977	68977	I	0	“ I ’m not blaming you for anything , darling . I know how hard this has been for you , and I feel awful we ’re not there more often to help you out . But the extreme cold is bad for Daddy ’s blood pressure . ”
69360	69371	69270	69270	she	1337	“ We ’re fine , Mom . I ’m managing . ”
69372	69430	69481	69481	she	1338	“ Of course you are . You ’re a wonderful father , and I know you love those girls to pieces . But I also know you must be lonely too , and with a pretty young girl around so much , I can see how tempting it would be to … take advantage of the situation . ”
69431	69440	69441	69441	I	0	“ I ’m not taking advantage of anything ! ”
69444	69468	69441	69441	I	0	“ Okay , okay . I did n’t mean to upset you , I just want to make certain the kids are protected . ”
69515	69541	69508	69508	she	1338	“ The kids are my number one priority , Mom . They always have been . And they ’ll stay that way no matter what . ”
69542	69556	69508	69508	she	1338	“ Good . Well , I ’ll see you Thursday then , dear . ”
69557	69563	69564	69564	I	0	“ Have a safe trip . ”
69712	69715	69704	69704	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
69716	69721	69752	69752	her	68	“ Who ’s Frannie ? ”
69722	69725	69752	69752	her	68	“ What ? ”
69726	69745	69752	69752	her	68	“ Frannie . Millie texted me all weekend about Frannie this and Frannie that . Who is she ? ”
69762	69774	69757	69757	she	68	“ Frannie Sawyer . From Cloverleigh . She babysits for them . ”
69775	69781	69752	69752	her	68	“ Is she my replacement ? ”
69782	69794	69752	69752	her	68	“ I ’m hanging up , Carla . You ’re drunk . ”
69795	69801	69757	69757	she	68	“ Are you fucking her ? ”
69802	69810	69752	69752	her	68	“ That ’s none of your business . ”
69811	69843	69752	69752	her	68	“ The hell it is n’t . I ’m their mother . How dare you bring some little slut into the house ? How old is she , twenty - two ? ”
69844	69849	69850	69850	I	0	“ Twenty - seven , ”
69863	69894	69858	69858	She	1344	“ Well , I get why you ’re chasing her around , but what the hell does she want with you ? Does she think you have money or something ? ”
69899	69906	69858	69858	She	1344	“ She knows who I am . ”
69907	69936	69752	69752	her	68	“ Oh , so she ’s a mind reader ? Because you never told me who you were . And why does Millie think she ’s so great ? ”
69937	69943	69944	69944	I	0	“ Because she ’s here , ”
69948	69971	69944	69944	I	0	“ And she cares about them . She gives them love and attention , which is more than they get from you . ”
69972	69988	69752	69752	her	68	“ I ’m their mother . They ’re supposed to love me no matter what . ”
69989	69993	69752	69752	her	68	“ You left . ”
69994	70001	70002	70002	she	1345	“ Because you forced me to ! ”
70005	70032	70002	70002	she	1345	“ If you would have been a better husband , I would n’t have felt so alone ! It ’s your fault I had to leave . ”
70033	70036	69752	69752	her	68	“ Carla . ”
70037	70054	69752	69752	her	68	“ Just admit it — you did n’t want to marry me in the first place . ”
70055	70102	69752	69752	her	68	“ You ’re right . I did n’t want to get married that soon . We ’d only known each other for a few months . We were young . I was about to deploy for Iraq . But I did what I thought was right . ”
70103	70113	70114	70114	she	1345	“ I never wanted to be your charity case ! ”
70117	70140	70114	70114	she	1345	“ It was n’t like that , and you know it . I tried hard to be a good husband and father . ”
70141	70149	69752	69752	her	68	“ You did n’t try hard enough . ”
70150	70171	69752	69752	her	68	“ You wanted too much from me , Carla . No matter what I did , it was never enough . ”
70172	70190	69752	69752	her	68	“ I only wanted you to pay attention to me . I wanted you to love me . ”
70191	70197	70198	70198	I	0	“ I did , Carla . ”
70203	70222	70198	70198	I	0	“ But you were always sulking and pouting . Punishing me for things I had no control over . ”
70223	70231	69752	69752	her	68	“ Like leaving us all the time ? ”
70232	70247	69752	69752	her	68	“ I had no choice about my deployments , Carla . You know that . ”
70248	70268	70198	70198	I	0	“ And when you got back , you were always so happy to see the kids but not me . ”
70269	70275	70198	70198	I	0	“ That is n’t true . ”
70276	70292	69752	69752	her	68	“ Well , that ’s what it felt like . You were cold and distant . ”
70293	70322	70198	70198	I	0	“ I needed time to readjust . Life at home was a shock to me . You never understood that . You never let me talk about it . ”
70323	70365	70198	70198	I	0	“ Because I wanted you to just forget it and be the husband I ’d dreamed about . The husband I deserved . I ’d waited and waited and waited for you , and then you came home and disappointed me . ”
70366	70371	70372	70372	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
70385	70399	70400	70400	she	1346	“ That ’s why I had to spend all that money on things , ”
70404	70424	70400	70400	she	1346	“ That ’s why I drank . I was trying to fill the void you left in my life . ”
70431	70439	70425	70425	I	0	“ I hope you ’re happier now . ”
70440	70444	70445	70445	she	1346	“ I am ! ”
70448	70467	70445	70445	she	1346	“ And since you ’re all doing so well without me , maybe I ’ll never come back . ”
70468	70481	70482	70482	She	1346	“ You do what you want , Carla . You always have . ”
70671	70674	70663	70664	my mother	236	“ Hello ? ”
70675	70681	70663	70664	my mother	236	“ Hey , guess what ? “
70684	70685	70686	70686	I	0	” “
70713	70714	70692	70692	She	110	” “
70719	70720	70692	70692	She	110	” “
70758	70759	70765	70765	Frannie	47	” “
70773	70778	70767	70767	I	0	” She giggled nervously . “
70795	70851	70852	70852	I	0	” Of course I wanted to . I wanted to do all kinds of things for her , and in a perfect world , I ’d be able to . But we did n’t have perfection — not even close . And this felt like something I could manage that did n’t look overly romantic . “
70898	70899	70890	70890	I	0	” “
70980	70988	70968	70968	I	0	” I smiled at her breathless enthusiasm . “
71003	71015	71001	71001	Charmin	119	” She laughed , and the sound made my chest tighten . “
71049	71050	71046	71046	I	0	” “
71053	71054	71046	71046	I	0	” “
71101	71105	71086	71086	you	1356	” I grimaced . “
71116	71117	71086	71086	you	1356	” “
71136	71141	71126	71126	you	1356	” Her voice quieted . “
71150	71151	71152	71152	Me	0	” “
71155	71287	71152	71152	Me	0	” I said , and it was n’t a lie . I was glad I ’d gone after her . But the more time I spent with her , the more I wanted with her . And not just sneaking - around time , either — real time , where we did n’t have to hide or rush or worry about being caught . That was impossible without telling the kids , and it was too soon to do that . I supposed I could hire another babysitter and spend time with her apart from the kids , but that would take away from time with my girls , which would make me feel selfish and guilty , and it would give their mother even more ammunition . I could n’t win .
71467	71473	71474	71474	she	386	“ You must be Frannie , ”
71481	71492	71474	71474	she	386	“ Please come in . It ’s freezing out there . ”
71493	71496	71502	71502	she	386	“ Thanks . ”
71540	71543	71544	71544	She	386	“ Welcome . ”
71550	71557	71558	71558	She	386	“ I ’m Natalie , and … ”
71563	71569	71558	71558	She	386	“ This is the place . ”
71579	71606	71574	71574	I	0	“ I ’m Frannie , and I love the place . I ’ve been in here several times and have always thought it was so cute . ”
71610	71645	71607	71607	Natalie	112	“ Thank you . It ’s been a great location for me . I opened it five years ago and I swear , we ’re busier every year , even in the off season . ”
71646	71653	71654	71654	She	386	“ Really ? That ’s amazing . ”
71657	71707	71654	71654	She	386	“ Of course , we get a lot more people in the summer because of tourism , but we ’ve got a lot of loyal locals now too . Would you like to see the kitchen ? Maxima should be here shortly , but we can go on back . ”
71708	71721	71722	71722	I	0	“ Thanks . I asked a friend to meet me here too . ”
71730	71737	71722	71722	I	0	“ I hope that ’s okay . ”
71738	71742	71654	71654	She	386	“ Of course ! ”
71743	71765	71654	71654	She	386	“ Actually , he knows you — sort of . He said he went to school with your sister , Jillian ? ”
71766	71772	71722	71722	I	0	“ What ’s his name ? ”
71773	71783	71654	71654	She	386	“ Declan MacAllister , but he goes by Mack . ”
71784	71791	71654	71654	She	386	“ That sounds familiar , actually . ”
71792	71810	71811	71811	She	1365	“ You might have known my sister too — she graduated that same year . Sylvia Sawyer ? ”
71814	71829	71830	71830	I	0	“ That definitely sounds familiar . Small world up here , is n’t it ? ”
71833	71836	71830	71830	I	0	“ Yes . ”
71837	71845	71846	71846	She	1365	“ But I like small town connections . ”
71854	71858	71846	71846	She	1365	“ Follow me . ”
71942	71947	71948	71948	I	0	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
71959	71968	71948	71948	I	0	“ Thanks . Let me show you around . ”
72138	72143	72135	72135	Natalie	112	“ They ’re beautiful ! ”
72144	72152	72154	72154	Maxima	110	“ Wait ’ til you taste them , ”
72156	72160	72154	72154	Maxima	110	“ Can I ? ”
72161	72165	72166	72166	I	0	“ Of course , ”
72174	72181	72166	72166	I	0	“ I brought them for you . ”
72193	72198	72199	72199	she	112	“ Oh my God , ”
72202	72207	72208	72208	I	0	“ It ’s exquisite . ”
72211	72215	72208	72208	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
72261	72268	72269	72269	she	112	“ I know it sounds silly , ”
72280	72351	72269	72269	she	112	“ but this shop is like part of me . I opened it when I was just twenty - three and had no idea what I was doing . I got engaged right outside the door . I have more memories in this shop — of family and friends and people in my life — than I do at my own house . I ’ve been here longer . Sorry . ”
72362	72373	72352	72352	She	112	“ I ’m always more emotional when I ’m pregnant . ”
72374	72379	72380	72380	I	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
72384	72440	72380	72380	I	0	“ I understand . I feel attached to Cloverleigh that way too . I was thinking recently that I do n’t know if I could ever move too far away , because it ’s so much a part of me . I grew up there . My roots are there . My heart is there . ”
72446	72473	72380	72380	I	0	“ But if I do n’t try to branch out a little , do something more just for me , I ’ll always wonder what if . ”
72481	72510	72511	72511	She	112	“ I know exactly what you mean . And even if this place is n’t what you had in mind , I think you should go for it . ”
72519	72538	72511	72511	She	112	“ You ’re so talented . I ’d carry these in my shop every day of the week . ”
72539	72543	72474	72474	Natalie	112	“ Thank you . ”
72558	72621	72553	72553	Mack	104	“ I think this place is perfect . What I ’m looking for is kitchen space to bake in and counter space to sell in . I also need time to bake extra for weekend events like weddings . The busier I get , the tougher it is to use my own little kitchen , especially if I do events outside Cloverleigh . ”
72622	72629	72630	72630	Natalie	112	“ Are you an early riser ? ”
72633	72641	72630	72630	Natalie	112	“ Bakeries are not for night owls . ”
72642	72655	72656	72656	I	0	“ I ’d definitely say I ’m more of an early riser , ”
72660	72686	72658	72658	her	112	“ I like schedules and routine , and I ’m good with deadlines . I ’m organized , outgoing , and easy to work with . ”
72691	72713	72688	72688	I	0	“ But I ’ll be honest and say the thought of running my own business leaves me weak in the knees . ”
72714	72721	72722	72722	Maxima	110	“ Are you willing to learn ? ”
72725	72728	72722	72722	Maxima	110	“ Totally . ”
72729	72737	72738	72738	Natalie	112	“ And I ’m willing to teach , ”
72748	72760	72738	72738	Natalie	112	“ At least until I pop this one out in May . ”
72761	72770	72772	72772	Maxima	110	“ Do you know what you ’re having ? ”
72774	72778	72779	72779	Natalie	112	“ A girl . ”
72784	72818	72779	72779	Natalie	112	“ I ’d have been happy either way , of course . We already have one of each , but I ’ve got sisters and there ’s something so special about that bond . ”
72819	72823	72824	72824	I	0	“ I agree , ”
72827	72834	72824	72824	I	0	“ I ’ve got sisters too . ”
72835	72839	72840	72840	she	112	“ Any kids ? ”
72849	72855	72840	72840	she	112	“ No . Not yet . ”
72861	72865	72856	72856	I	0	“ Hopefully someday . ”
72866	72888	72889	72889	Natalie	112	“ Well , you ’ll be pretty busy with a new business for a while , so no need to rush . ”
72894	72904	72889	72889	Natalie	112	“ Okay , so what ’s the next step ? ”
73038	73111	73112	73112	I	0	“ Hey , I ’m so sorry , but I ca n’t meet you today . Mrs. Ingersoll called , and said Felicity came home with a bad fever . I ’m running home to take her into the doctor . I feel horrible , and I wo n’t blame you for being mad . I ’ll call you as soon as I can . I want to hear how it went . ”
73240	73247	73248	73248	she	64	“ That ’s awesome , Frannie , ”
73251	73268	73248	73248	she	64	“ I know exactly the place you ’re talking about and I think it ’s perfect . ”
73322	73329	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ Hey , how ’s Felicity ? ”
73330	73374	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ She ’s okay . Just a virus . I gave her some Motrin and put her to bed . Mrs. Ingersoll just left . Now I ’ve got to feed these other two monkeys and make sure they get their homework done . ”
73375	73380	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ You sound exhausted . ”
73381	73458	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ I did n’t sleep well last night , and this week is nuts . I have to get the house in shape for my parents ’ visit , I have Best Man shit to take care of , and I have to cram five days of work into three since I ’m taking Thursday and Friday off — mostly to spend some time with my parents since the weekend will be full of wedding shit . ”
73459	73507	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ Why do n’t you let me come over and help ? I can be there in fifteen minutes , and you can deal with the homework and the house while I make dinner . That way you ’re not trying to do everything on your own . ”
73508	73535	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ That ’s okay . I ’m used to it . And you do n’t owe me any favors right now , that ’s for sure . ”
73536	73552	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ Mack ! Stop it . What are you going to feed them , anyway ? ”
73553	73562	73320	73320	Mack	104	“ I do n’t know . Chicken nuggets . ”
73579	73592	73593	73593	I	0	“ I could bring the stuffed shells I made last Saturday night … ”
73599	73630	73596	73596	He	1390	“ That sounds so good . But I do n’t want you to think you have to rescue me all the time . I can handle things on my own . ”
73631	73682	73685	73685	he	1390	“ I know you can . But why do it alone when you do n’t have to ? I ’m standing here alone in an empty apartment , Mack . I ’d much rather be at your house . Besides , that way I can tell you about the meeting . ”
73688	73706	73685	73685	he	1390	“ Okay . If you ’re coming because you want to , I guess it ’s fine . ”
73707	73718	73685	73685	he	1390	“ I want to . I ’ll be there soon . ”
73798	73807	73808	73808	she	1391	“ I ’ll get out of your way , ”
73814	73824	73808	73808	she	1391	“ I know it ’s been a long day . ”
73842	73857	73860	73860	she	1391	“ Thank you for everything . I do n’t deserve you or your shells . ”
73865	73878	73860	73860	she	1391	“ Thanks for listening to me babble on about the coffee shop . ”
73879	73917	73918	73918	She	1391	“ I loved hearing you so excited . I think it ’s a great plan . Less risk than if you were going it alone , and you get the benefit of her experience and loyal customers . ”
73921	73950	73918	73918	She	1391	“ I ca n’t decide if I should ask my dad for the money to buy in or take Maxima Radley up on her offer for a loan . ”
73951	74021	73860	73860	she	1391	“ Both have positives and negatives . Your dad would probably give you a better interest rate — if he made you pay it back at all — but taking money from family members can be fraught with problems . Now , your dad does n’t seem like the kind of guy to hold it over your head , but it ’s still a risk . Talk to him . ”
74022	74025	73918	73918	She	1391	“ Okay . ”
74026	74034	74035	74035	I	0	“ I know if it were me , ”
74039	74067	74068	74068	She	1394	“ I ’d want to be the one to help my daughter if I could . And I ’d hope that she came to me to ask . ”
74073	74083	74068	74068	She	1394	“ Thank you . I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
74084	74087	74088	74088	Frannie	104	“ Dad ? ”
74118	74127	74128	74128	I	0	“ I thought you were in the shower , ”
74135	74141	74128	74128	I	0	“ The water is running . ”
74142	74167	74199	74199	she	49	“ I just turned it on and remembered that I forgot to tell you I need the twenty dollars for the fashion show tomorrow . ”
74168	74183	74199	74199	she	49	“ Wait a minute , we have to pay to be in this thing ? ”
74184	74197	74199	74199	she	49	“ It ’s for charity , Dad . Everybody has to pay . ”
74204	74219	74199	74199	she	49	“ Will you come to the show ? It ’s a week from Saturday . ”
74220	74240	74241	74241	I	0	“ Of course I will . I would n’t miss your dad in a pink glittery shirt for anything . ”
74260	74280	74241	74241	I	0	“ Get back up there and get in the shower , or I ’ll have no hot water left . ”
74296	74303	74304	74304	I	0	“ Do you think she saw ? ”
74307	74311	74312	74312	she	49	“ Maybe not , ”
74325	74334	74319	74319	she	49	“ But we should definitely be more careful . ”
74463	74467	74432	74432	she	70	“ Come in . ”
74479	74482	74474	74474	Frannie	104	“ Hi . ”
74483	74486	74487	74487	I	0	“ Hey . ”
74498	74504	74487	74487	I	0	“ How ’s it going ? ”
74505	74518	74474	74474	Frannie	104	“ Good . I just had an awesome conversation with my dad . ”
74519	74532	74533	74533	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? Come on in . Tell me about it . ”
74547	74556	74533	74533	I	0	“ I have n’t seen you all day . ”
74571	74596	74567	74567	her	49	“ You ’re not too busy ? I do n’t want to bother you . I know you ’re short on time this week . ”
74597	74604	74474	74474	Frannie	104	“ I could use a break . ”
74605	74651	74567	74567	her	49	“ Well , I wo n’t take up too much time , I just wanted to tell you that I went over the numbers Natalie gave me with my dad , and he said he ’d give me what I ’ll need to buy in . ”
74652	74660	74661	74661	She	1404	“ He ’s giving it to you ? ”
74668	74705	74661	74661	She	1404	“ Uh huh . He said it ’s about equal to what my sisters ’ educations cost , and since I never went away to school , I can have it to invest in my business . ”
74706	74713	74714	74714	Her	1404	“ Frannie , that ’s amazing . ”
74739	74759	74760	74760	She	1404	“ I know ! I ’m so excited , I do n’t even know what to do with myself . ”
74771	74784	74785	74785	She	1404	“ I ’ve got an idea . Come sit on my lap . ”
74792	74806	74785	74785	She	1404	“ No , you ’ve got work to do . I should go . ”
74807	74819	74820	74820	I	0	“ Do n’t make me come over there and get you . ”
74830	74835	74836	74836	She	1404	“ Lock the door . ”
74848	74857	74836	74836	She	1404	“ Want me to turn out the lights ? ”
74858	74868	74889	74889	I	0	“ Fuck no . I want to watch you . ”
74869	74874	74875	74875	she	1404	“ Watch me what ? ”
74898	74913	74893	74893	I	0	“ Watch you get on your knees and take my cock in your mouth . ”
75023	75028	75029	75029	I	0	“ Are you nervous ? ”
75180	75183	75184	75184	I	0	“ More , ”
75260	75263	75240	75240	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
75264	75269	75270	75270	she	1404	“ Do n’t be , ”
75286	75302	75270	75270	she	1404	“ I told you I like it when you get rough . I meant it . ”
75320	75325	75311	75311	I	0	“ In that case … ”
75715	75718	75719	75719	he	104	“ Jesus , ”
75726	75733	75719	75719	he	104	“ That was so fucking intense . ”
75769	75774	75749	75749	he	104	“ Are you okay ? ”
75775	75793	75794	75794	His	104	“ More than okay . I loved it . I ’m all hot and bothered right now . ”
75801	75812	75794	75794	His	104	“ You ’re telling me doing that turned you on ? ”
75822	75868	75813	75813	I	0	“ Yes . I like hearing you . And feeling you . And being able to give you all of my attention without any distractions . Usually when you come , I do too , and I ’m too carried away to focus on you . ”
75869	75880	75881	75881	he	104	“ I happen to like when you get carried away , ”
75892	75912	75881	75881	he	104	“ So now I think it ’s my turn to give you all of my attention without any distractions . ”
75913	75928	75929	75929	I	0	“ Mack , no ! You ’re supposed to be catching up on work . ”
75961	75965	75966	75966	He	104	“ Fuck work . ”
75996	76010	75988	75988	I	0	“ And it ’s late . Wo n’t Mrs. Ingersoll be expecting you ? ”
76011	76016	76017	76017	He	104	“ Fuck Mrs. Ingersoll . ”
76030	76039	76020	76020	his	104	“ But … what about … the kids … ”
76092	76177	76089	76089	his	104	“ I ’m not thinking about the kids right now . And I do n’t want to . I spend all day every day doing things for them , and I will for the rest of my life . But right now , it ’s about what I want . And that is to bury my face in your pussy and make you come with my tongue . Then I ’d like to fuck you on my desk . Does that work for you ? ”
76178	76183	76184	76184	I	0	“ Uh . Yes , ”
76196	76212	76213	76213	He	104	“ Good . After that , I will go back to being a responsible person . ”
76237	76241	76242	76242	I	0	“ You will ? ”
76260	76263	76264	76264	He	104	“ Maybe . ”
76285	76295	76275	76275	his	104	“ I ’m not too good at keeping promises . ”
76345	76357	76358	76358	I	0	“ I ’m telling you , she is fine with us , ”
76366	76380	76358	76358	I	0	“ She asked me over the weekend if there was something going on . ”
76381	76387	76358	76358	I	0	“ What did you say ? ”
76388	76421	76422	76422	He	104	“ I said we were taking it slow for the sake of the kids , but that we ’ve been getting to know each other better . She said that was smart . ”
76430	76438	76439	76439	I	0	“ My mother reacted a little differently . ”
76446	76451	76439	76439	I	0	“ You told her ? ”
76452	76497	76422	76422	He	104	“ No , but when she called on Sunday night , she sort of suspected , based on how much the girls talked about you . Then she asked a bunch of questions , and my answers must have made it even more obvious . ”
76508	76515	76501	76501	I	0	“ So what did she say ? ”
76516	76527	76576	76576	his	104	“ Just a bunch of things that I already knew . ”
76528	76532	76533	76533	He	104	“ Like what ? ”
76541	76550	76533	76533	He	104	“ Mostly that I need to be careful . ”
76590	76601	76582	76582	he	104	“ Well , I definitely think you ’re being careful . ”
76606	76626	76603	76603	I	0	“ Although Winnie did catch us in the closet . And Millie might have seen us in the kitchen . ”
76631	76634	76627	76627	His	104	“ Yeah . ”
76635	76649	76720	76720	his	104	“ We ’ve probably gotten a little careless . We can do better . ”
76650	76691	76720	76720	his	104	“ I wish we did n’t have to worry about it . But that conversation with her has been eating at me this week . She made me feel guilty — well , guiltier — about what we ’re doing . ”
76692	76708	76627	76627	His	104	“ Moms are good at that . They know exactly how to push our buttons . ”
76709	76717	76718	76718	He	104	“ It ’s not fair to you . ”
76723	76746	76718	76718	He	104	“ What the fuck are you doing with me ? You ’ve got so much to give and I ’ve got nothing . ”
76759	76784	76752	76752	I	0	“ Hey . That ’s not true . We knew this would be tricky at the start , but we ’re making it work . ”
76785	76793	76794	76794	I	0	“ My ex called on Sunday too . ”
76797	76801	76794	76794	I	0	“ She did ? ”
76802	76811	76752	76752	I	0	“ Yeah . She knows about us too . ”
76812	76817	76794	76794	I	0	“ You told her ? ”
76832	76855	76827	76827	He	104	“ No . She made the accusation based on how much Millie was texting about you . I did n’t deny it . ”
76856	76861	76752	76752	I	0	“ You did n’t ? ”
76890	76904	76905	76905	He	104	“ No . But maybe I should have . I do n’t know . ”
76917	76925	76913	76913	I	0	“ Well … what did she say ? ”
76926	76985	76913	76913	I	0	“ A lot of ugly shit about me , which I do n’t care about , but then she threatened never to visit the kids again . Which would be fine with me , but she ’ll find a way to twist everything so it ’s my fault the kids do n’t have a relationship with their mother . ”
76986	76991	76992	76992	I	0	“ Oh , Mack . ”
77011	77023	77024	77024	He	104	“ I ’m sorry . Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
77027	77091	77024	77024	He	104	“ Because this is n’t your problem . I do n’t want you to have to deal with my hostile ex - wife . Hell , I do n’t want to deal with her . But I have to . I ’ll always have to , because she ’s my kids ’ mom . That will never change . And neither will she . ”
77112	77119	77104	77104	I	0	“ Hey . It ’s okay . ”
77120	77147	77164	77164	His	104	“ It ’s not . And it ’s just one more reason why you should walk away from me and find someone easier to be with . ”
77148	77163	77164	77164	His	104	“ I ’m not going anywhere , Mack . You know that , right ? ”
77205	77228	77195	77195	April	59	“ Hey , I ’m meeting with Stella Devine tonight at six to go over some details . Want to join us ? ”
77229	77235	77253	77253	My	0	“ Sure . Your office ? ”
77236	77241	77242	77242	I	0	“ Bar , actually . ”
77245	77252	77242	77242	I	0	“ I ’ll meet you there . ”
77406	77417	77418	77419	my sister	237	“ Whew , we ’re off duty for the night , ”
77422	77429	77430	77430	I	0	“ Want a glass of wine ? ”
77433	77439	77430	77430	I	0	“ I ’d love one . ”
77463	77469	77470	77470	she	237	“ So how are things ? ”
77476	77500	77470	77470	she	237	“ I ’ve been getting an earful from Mom about your big plans , but we have n’t had a chance to talk . ”
77501	77510	77511	77511	I	0	“ Things with that are great , actually . ”
77520	77559	77511	77511	I	0	“ Dad and I are going to meet with Natalie Haas next week about the financing , and I pretty much gave Mom my notice . Week after next , I ’ll be at Coffee Darling full time . ”
77560	77588	77470	77470	she	237	“ That ’s so awesome . I remember Natalie Nixon from school , although she ’s a little younger than me . That whole family is nice . ”
77589	77601	77602	77602	April	59	“ Mack said he went to school with her sister Jillian . ”
77605	77631	77602	77602	April	59	“ I graduated with the middle sister , Skylar . She works at Abelard Vineyards now , and I think Chloe knows her pretty well . ”
77637	77649	77634	77634	her	59	“ Speaking of Mack , how are things with you two ? ”
77650	77657	77470	77470	she	237	“ Pretty good , I guess . ”
77658	77662	77470	77470	she	237	“ You guess ? ”
77663	77719	77634	77634	her	59	“ Well , it ’s kind of hard to tell . When we ’re alone , it ’s amazing . Actually , even when the kids are around , it ’s amazing . He ’s sweet and funny and he ’s so flipping hot , I ca n’t stand it . The sex is unreal . ”
77720	77723	77724	77724	she	59	“ But … ”
77732	77790	77727	77727	I	0	“ But it ’s difficult . I feel bad for even saying this out loud , but trying to date a full - time single dad with three kids and keep it from them is tough — especially when you ’re the nanny . Twice now the kids have walked in on us kissing in the house . ”
77794	77800	77791	77791	April	59	“ What did they say ? ”
77815	77839	77801	77801	I	0	“ Nothing really , but it ’s obvious they ’re confused . Kids are smart . They have to sense something is up . ”
77840	77850	77634	77634	her	59	“ Why does n’t he want to tell them ? ”
77851	77909	77801	77801	I	0	“ Well , when it first started , we agreed to keep it to ourselves because it was so new . But I do n’t think we realized how quickly things were going to progress — I know I did n’t . I just hope he feels what I feel . I ’m nervous he does n’t . ”
77910	77919	77801	77801	I	0	“ Because he wo n’t tell the kids ? ”
77920	78001	77634	77634	her	59	“ No , I get that , but the other night he said this thing that I ca n’t get out of my head . He said he worries about what will happen when I realize he ’s not worth the shit I ’ll have to put up with . He said , ‘ You ’ll leave , because you know you deserve better . And I ’ll have to let you , because I ’ll know it too . ’ ”
78007	78015	78002	78002	April	59	“ Damn . What did you say ? ”
78016	78026	78027	78027	I	0	“ I told him I ’d prove him wrong . ”
78031	78082	78027	78027	I	0	“ And I hope he gives me time to do that , but what if he decides I ’m not worth all the sneaking around and feeling bad ? He told me last night that his mother was suspicious something was going on with us and lectured him about it . ”
78088	78126	78083	78083	I	0	“ He warned me this was going to be tough , and he was right … but he ’s worth it , April . I feel this down deep . I do n’t want to give up . ”
78135	78196	78127	78127	She	1429	“ You want my advice ? Just give it time . It ’s only been a few weeks , and he ’s probably still got a bad taste in his mouth about relationships because of his history . Divorce is really hard — it messes with your head . He ’s trying to protect his kids , maybe even himself . ”
78197	78200	78201	78201	She	1429	“ Himself ? ”
78204	78229	78201	78201	She	1429	“ Sure . Love is scary . You have to wear your heart outside your chest . He did that once and got burned . ”
78235	78282	78230	78230	I	0	“ God , that ’s exactly it . It does feel like I ’m wearing my heart outside my chest with him . Like my chest is n’t even big enough to hold it . But even though it feels huge , it feels fragile too . ”
78290	78301	78283	78283	Her	1429	“ Congratulations , little sister . You ’re in love . ”
78573	78589	78590	78590	he	54	“ I ca n’t fucking look at another flower , cake , or seating arrangement , ”
78593	78601	78590	78590	he	54	“ Seriously , just shoot me first . ”
78602	78608	78547	78547	He	54	“ Is it that bad ? ”
78609	78664	78547	78547	He	54	“ Yes . I have absolutely no opinions on that shit and she does n’t seem to understand that . It ’s like she takes it personally . I tell her all I care about is that we walk out of there married . She could wear a paper bag for all I care . ”
78665	78670	78671	78671	I	0	“ Oh , Jesus . ”
78676	78685	78671	78671	I	0	“ You did not say that to her . ”
78686	78697	78698	78698	He	54	“ I did . She was not pleased with me . ”
78711	78726	78698	78698	He	54	“ So when are you gon na tell me what ’s up with you ? ”
78752	78759	78745	78745	We	1439	“ I think I fucked up . ”
78760	78767	78768	78768	I	0	“ I ’m sure you did . ”
78777	78791	78768	78768	I	0	“ Shit . You ’re serious . Is it one of the kids ? ”
78792	78795	78796	78796	I	0	“ No . ”
78807	78813	78796	78796	I	0	“ It ’s Frannie Sawyer . ”
78814	78822	78823	78823	I	0	“ Frannie Sawyer ? What about her ? ”
78843	78849	78836	78836	He	54	“ Jesus . Did you ? ”
78858	78877	78855	78855	I	0	“ Yeah . I did . Multiple times . It ’s sort of an ongoing fuck - up . ”
78878	78881	78882	78882	He	54	“ Shit . ”
78890	78896	78882	78882	He	54	“ How old is she ? ”
78897	78902	78855	78855	I	0	“ Twenty - seven . ”
78903	78919	78855	78855	I	0	“ Oh . Well , that ’s not bad . Are you worried about Sawyer ? ”
78920	78930	78931	78931	I	0	“ I ’m worried about a lot of things . ”
78936	78974	78931	78931	I	0	“ I do n’t know what the fuck I was thinking , starting something with her . I do n’t have time for a girlfriend . I barely have time to piss with the bathroom door shut . ”
78978	78982	78975	78975	Woods	54	“ I bet . ”
78983	78999	79000	79000	Woods	54	“ It ’s impossible to be alone with her . The kids are always around . ”
79008	79019	79000	79000	Woods	54	“ She ’s probably great with the kids , though . ”
79020	79023	79024	79024	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
79028	79035	79024	79024	I	0	“ They ’re crazy about her . ”
79036	79046	79047	79047	I	0	“ Do they know about the two of you ? ”
79052	79099	79047	79047	I	0	“ Not yet . It ’s only been a few weeks . But it ’s getting harder and harder to keep it from them , especially since she ’s at the house a few days a week . And I know she wants to tell them . ”
79100	79105	79024	79024	I	0	“ You do n’t ? ”
79106	79164	79165	79165	I	0	“ No . I do n’t want them to feel like they ’re getting less of me , I do n’t want to throw a major wrench into their lives when we ’re finally doing okay , and I do n’t want them to get attached to the idea that she ’s going to be around forever , ”
79172	79178	79165	79165	I	0	“ Because she ’s not . ”
79179	79185	79024	79024	I	0	“ How do you know ? ”
79186	79201	79202	79202	He	1441	“ Why would she be ? I ca n’t give her what she wants . ”
79208	79220	79202	79202	He	1441	“ What does she want that you ca n’t give her ? ”
79221	79255	79024	79024	I	0	“ Time . Attention . A future . I know for a fact she wants a husband and kids . I ca n’t be that guy . I ’m never getting married again . ”
79256	79263	79024	79024	I	0	“ Have you told her that ? ”
79264	79267	79202	79202	He	1441	“ No . ”
79268	79272	79024	79024	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
79273	79280	79024	79024	I	0	“ Because I ’m an asshole . ”
79281	79288	79202	79202	He	1441	“ Well , sure , but … ”
79295	79347	79024	79024	I	0	“ Because I do n’t want to give her up . It ’s so wrong on so many levels , I know it is , but it ’s also so fucking good . Not just the sex , either , although that part is unbelievable . She ’s all young and hot and”—I
79352	79354	79024	79024	I	0	word—“enthusiastic . ”
79360	79369	79355	79355	Woods	54	“ You definitely do n’t want unenthusiastic sex . ”
79370	79406	79202	79202	He	1441	“ But that ’s what I was used to . Uninspiring , unexciting , unenthusiastic , obligatory sex with someone who did n’t actually give a shit about me . She never even knew me . ”
79407	79410	79411	79411	I	0	“ No ? ”
79416	79462	79411	79411	I	0	“ No , everything spun out of control so fast when Carla got pregnant , and I did three tours practically back to back , and suddenly we had three kids , a mortgage , and a stockpile of weapons to use against each other . ”
79463	79468	79469	79469	I	0	“ That ’s tough . ”
79477	79547	79469	79469	I	0	“ It was always all about Carla — what she wanted , what she was n’t getting , what I was doing wrong as a husband . With Frannie , it ’s so different . She wants to know me . She ’s so easy to be with . She loves the girls . She puts up with a lot of shit that no one else would . And … ”
79554	79590	79548	79548	I	0	“ She cooks . She fucking comes over and cooks for us because I ’m too clueless and exhausted to figure out how to feed my kids healthy food at the end of the day . ”
79591	79601	79602	79602	I	0	“ Sounds like maybe you should keep her around . ”
79607	79652	79602	79602	I	0	“ I ca n’t keep letting her waste all this time on me . There are too many complications , between the kids and Carla making things difficult at every turn , and what people will say and what she wants for the future . ”
79653	79659	79660	79660	Woods	54	“ What will people say ? ”
79663	79672	79660	79660	Woods	54	“ You know . They ’ll just gossip . ”
79681	79725	79673	79673	I	0	“ They ’ll say I ’m fucking the nanny , and she ’s so much younger , and my divorce is barely final , and it ’s not fair to the kids , and I ’m just taking advantage of her , and — ”
79726	79730	79731	79731	Woods	54	“ Fuck that , ”
79735	79758	79731	79731	Woods	54	“ Anyone who knows you will know that ’s complete bullshit . And since when have you ever cared what people say ? ”
79759	79781	79782	79782	Woods	54	“ I ca n’t take that attitude where the kids and Frannie are concerned . This is n’t just about me . ”
79806	79823	79797	79797	he	54	“ Do you remember what you said to me after I broke things off with Stella ? ”
79824	79832	79731	79731	Woods	54	“ That you were being a dipshit ? ”
79833	79856	79857	79857	I	0	“ Yeah , and you are too , by the way , but you also said something else that I always remembered . ”
79862	79865	79857	79857	I	0	“ What ? ”
79866	79902	79731	79731	Woods	54	“ You said something like , ‘ If I had someone I trusted , who understood me and baked pies for me , and the sex was even marginal , I ’d marry her tomorrow . ”
79910	79939	79940	79940	Woods	54	“ But our situations are not similar at all . I meant I ’d do that if I were you . I ’ve got kids to think about . ”
79967	80033	79956	79956	He	54	“ And I ’m thinking of Frannie , too . I ’m letting her believe this can go somewhere when I know it ca n’t . And the longer this goes on , the worse it ’s going to be for everyone involved when it ends . The girls are already too attached to her . It ’s dangerous to be that attached to someone . ”
80034	80043	80044	80044	My	0	“ So what are you gon na do ? ”
80048	80062	80044	80044	My	0	“ I have to break it off . For the kids ’ sake . ”
80073	80129	80070	80070	he	54	“ You do what you ’ve got ta do , Mack . I just want to say one more thing , and then I ’ll shut up . Because this is probably going to piss you off , but we all need that one asshole in our life who says what needs to be said . ”
80137	80140	80070	80070	he	54	“ What ? ”
80141	80160	80161	80161	I	0	“ Are you doing this because the girls are too attached to her ? Or because you are ? ”
80166	80178	80179	80179	He	54	“ Fuck off . I ’m not doing this for me . ”
80185	80237	80182	80182	his	54	“ Okay , okay . I know you guys have been through a lot , and I ’m not a father , so I do n’t know what that ’s like . If you ’re that sure things can never work out with her , go ahead and break it off . ”
80238	80243	80244	80244	I	0	“ I ’m sure , ”
80254	80262	80244	80244	I	0	“ I have to break it off . ”
80326	80331	80332	80332	she	1442	“ Hey , you , ”
80335	80345	80332	80332	she	1442	“ How was your night out with the guys ? ”
80346	80351	80315	80315	she	1442	“ It was fine . ”
80361	80367	80352	80352	I	0	“ What did you do ? ”
80368	80378	80332	80332	she	1442	“ Just had a few beers . Some food . ”
80379	80384	80385	80385	she	1442	“ No strip clubs ? ”
80388	80399	80385	80385	she	1442	“ Not that there are any within a hundred miles . ”
80406	80409	80385	80385	she	1442	“ No . ”
80410	80417	80332	80332	she	1442	“ Did you get in late ? ”
80418	80423	80424	80424	I	0	“ Not too late . ”
80427	80441	80424	80424	I	0	“ Sorry I did n’t call . I was tired , I guess . ”
80466	80478	80479	80479	she	1442	“ Did you ask your parents about staying over tomorrow night ? ”
80483	80491	80479	80479	she	1442	“ Oh , uh … not yet . ”
80537	80544	80545	80545	She	1442	“ Is everything okay , Mack ? ”
80556	80568	80550	80550	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’m just … you know . Busy . ”
80581	80600	80601	80601	I	0	“ Oh . Okay , well , I wo n’t keep you . Just wanted to say hi . ”
80700	80707	80709	80709	Felicity	50	“ You look nice , Daddy , ”
80734	80737	80711	80713	All three girls	617	“ Thanks . ”
80754	80764	80766	80766	Millie	49	“ I wish we could come to the wedding , ”
80768	80772	80773	80773	I	0	“ Adults only , ”
80777	80798	80773	80773	I	0	“ I know , but I want to see the bride . Frannie said she ’d send me some pictures . ”
80803	80812	80799	80799	She	49	“ I ’ve never been to a wedding . ”
80820	80830	80831	80831	she	236	“ My goodness , do n’t you look handsome , ”
80843	80847	80831	80831	she	236	“ Thank you . ”
80856	80863	80831	80831	she	236	“ I guess I ’m ready . ”
80872	80879	80880	80880	she	236	“ What time is the ceremony ? ”
80883	80895	80880	80880	she	236	“ Four . Then pictures , then cocktails , then dinner . ”
80927	80932	80933	80934	my mother	236	“ Better get going , ”
80937	80956	80933	80934	my mother	236	“ It ’s nearly two and it ’s snowing again . Are you staying at the inn tonight ? ”
80976	80985	80957	80957	I	0	“ Maybe . I ’ll let you know . ”
80986	80991	80992	80992	She	236	“ Just do it . ”
81009	81049	80992	80992	She	236	“ That way you can relax and enjoy yourself without worrying about the roads or having a few drinks or whatever . You can stay and be social . Ask someone to dance . Be charming and make conversation . ”
81069	81079	81055	81055	I	0	“ Okay , enough . I have to go . ”
81080	81085	81086	81087	All three	165	“ Bye , Daddy ! ”
81106	81110	81086	81087	All three	165	“ Have fun ! ”
81237	81241	81217	81217	her	1459	“ Everybody decent ? ”
81242	81247	81248	81248	Woods	54	“ Come on in , ”
81338	81343	81344	81344	she	1459	“ It ’s time , ”
81355	81372	81344	81344	she	1459	“ I have instructions to come get you guys and take you over to the barn . ”
81373	81376	81377	81377	Woods	54	“ Finally . ”
81384	81389	81390	81390	he	54	“ Got the rings ? ”

81467	81470	81471	81471	she	1459	“ Thanks , ”
81479	81486	81471	81471	she	1459	“ You look nice , too . ”
81487	81492	81493	81493	I	0	“ How are you ? ”
81496	81499	81493	81493	I	0	“ Fine . ”

81525	81528	81500	81500	She	1459	“ Yeah . ”
81529	81542	81544	81544	she	1459	“ I ’m so happy for him . For both of them . ”
81547	81554	81544	81544	she	1459	“ And I ’m envious too . ”
81555	81563	81500	81500	She	1459	“ Because you want to get married ? ”
81564	81603	81604	81604	She	1459	“ Well , yes , eventually . But I guess I ’m mostly envious that it seems so easy for them to be together . I wish it was like that for us . Can you stay tonight ? ”
81651	81656	81657	81657	Her	1459	“ I think so . ”
81668	81693	81662	81662	her	1459	“ Good . Okay , take your coat . I ’m going to go let April know you ’re here . Do n’t move . ”

82031	82034	82024	82024	she	1459	“ Hey . ”
82035	82043	82044	82044	She	1459	“ Did n’t you like the cake ? ”
82063	82070	82071	82071	Her	1459	“ I ’m not that hungry . ”
82075	82090	82071	82071	Her	1459	“ I ’ve never heard you say that before . Are you feeling okay ? ”
82091	82097	82098	82098	I	0	“ Actually , not really . ”
82106	82113	82098	82098	I	0	“ I ’m a little warm . ”
82114	82140	82071	82071	Her	1459	“ Well , I was coming over to see if you wanted to dance , but maybe you ’d like to get some air instead ? ”
82141	82151	82152	82152	She	1459	“ Uh , yeah . Air would be good . ”
82161	82171	82152	82152	She	1459	“ Let me grab my coat from the back . ”
82172	82178	82179	82179	I	0	“ You can wear mine . ”
82200	82203	82204	82204	She	1459	“ Thanks . ”

82226	82232	82221	82221	She	1459	“ And it smells good . ”
82303	82312	82287	82287	Frannie	104	“ Whew , it was warm in there . ”
82313	82316	82359	82359	She	1459	“ Yeah . ”
82340	82358	82359	82359	She	1459	“ You ’re not off the hook , though . I still want to dance with you . ”
82364	82375	82359	82359	She	1459	“ I ’m not sure that ’s a good idea . ”
82382	82386	82376	82376	She	1459	“ Why not ? ”
82387	82390	82391	82391	I	0	“ Because … ”
82405	82416	82397	82397	I	0	“ I think we should slow down . Cool off . ”
82423	82432	82419	82419	her	1459	“ What ? Where is this coming from ? ”
82433	82447	82419	82419	her	1459	“ I ’ve just been thinking we ’re moving a little too fast . ”
82448	82452	82419	82419	her	1459	“ Since when ? ”
82456	82460	82419	82419	her	1459	“ Last week . ”
82461	82484	82419	82419	her	1459	“ I do n’t understand . On Wednesday in your office , things were fine . I ’ve hardly seen you since . ”
82485	82521	82419	82419	her	1459	“ That ’s part of the problem , Frannie . We ca n’t even see each other . It ’s too hard with all the sneaking around . And it ’s not fair to you . ”
82536	82550	82524	82524	she	1459	“ I ’ve told you a hundred times , I do n’t mind . ”
82551	82600	82419	82419	her	1459	“ Well , I do . I ca n’t keep doing it . It ’s making me feel like shit . I ca n’t be what you deserve and what my kids need . I just ca n’t . I feel like I ’m being torn in two . ”
82601	82605	82606	82606	she	1459	“ But Mack , ”
82616	82631	82606	82606	she	1459	“ I ’m in love with you . I ca n’t just walk away . ”
82642	82655	82632	82632	I	0	“ Do n’t say that . It ’ll only make things worse . ”
82656	82662	82663	82663	she	1459	“ But it ’s true , ”
82666	82681	82663	82663	she	1459	“ I ’ve never felt this way about anyone before in my entire life . ”
82682	82702	82632	82632	I	0	“ You ’re so young , Frannie . You ’ll meet someone else who can be what you want . ”
82703	82712	82713	82713	she	1459	“ I want you , you big jerk , ”
82774	82786	82787	82787	I	0	“ You think you want me , but you do n’t , ”
82791	82813	82787	82787	I	0	“ Where do you see this going , Frannie ? Where does it end ? Because it has to end somewhere . ”
82814	82817	82818	82818	she	1459	“ Why ? ”
82821	82832	82818	82818	she	1459	“ Because you want things I ca n’t give you . ”
82833	82837	82787	82787	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
82838	82848	82849	82849	I	0	“ You want a husband . You want children . ”
82854	82870	82849	82849	I	0	“ I ’m never getting married again , and I ’ve already had my children . ”
82871	82880	82881	82881	she	1459	“ I ’ve never even brought that up , ”
82899	82964	82881	82881	she	1459	“ But it ’s true , is n’t it ? You ’re envious of Ryan and Stella . You see how easy it could be . You want that promise of a future together , and you should have everything you want . I just ca n’t be part of it , and when you realize that down the road , you ’ll leave . ”
82965	82972	82881	82881	she	1459	“ You mean you wo n’t . ”
82973	82976	82881	82881	she	1459	“ What ? ”
82977	82986	82987	82987	She	1459	“ You wo n’t be part of it . ”
83002	83030	82987	82987	She	1459	“ You ’re choosing to end this now because you ’d rather be alone than take a chance on a future with me . You ’re afraid . ”
83034	83081	82987	82987	She	1459	“ I ’m realistic . I know what I am and what I ’m not capable of . And the girls are already too attached to you . What happens to them when this falls apart ? They ’ll be devastated . They ’ll hate me . ”
83082	83091	83092	83092	she	1459	“ Do n’t blame this on the girls , ”
83107	83113	83092	83092	she	1459	“ This is all you . ”
83114	83130	83132	83132	she	1459	“ Frannie , come on . I did n’t want it to be like this . ”
83601	83604	83605	83605	I	0	“ Hey , ”
83612	83615	83605	83605	I	0	“ Hey . ”

83627	83644	83609	83609	her	1494	“ I need to leave . Do you have enough help the rest of the night ? ”
83645	83653	83654	83654	I	0	“ Of course . Are you okay ? ”
83670	83676	83654	83654	I	0	“ Mack broke it off . ”

83684	83705	83609	83609	her	1494	“ He had a lot of reasons , but I do n’t really want to talk about it right now . ”
83706	83712	83713	83713	She	1494	“ Okay . I understand . ”
83719	83731	83713	83713	She	1494	“ Go cry it out . I ’ll call you tomorrow . ”
83732	83747	83609	83609	her	1494	“ Thanks . Make an excuse to Mom and Dad for me , okay ? ”
83748	83766	83713	83713	She	1494	“ Sure . I ’m really sorry , Frannie . I know how you feel about him . ”

83992	84027	83961	83961	I	0	“ Yes , but only me . Mom and Dad think you were n’t feeling well , which freaked Mom out , of course , but then I told her it was just cramps . ”
84028	84035	84058	84058	her	64	“ Thanks . Come on in . ”
84036	84041	84042	84042	she	64	“ You look terrible , ”
84050	84055	84056	84056	I	0	“ I feel worse , ”
84082	84092	84093	84093	She	64	“ So do you want to talk about it ? ”
84106	84112	84093	84093	She	64	“ That ’s for you . ”
84113	84120	84121	84121	I	0	“ What ’s to talk about ? ”
84129	84136	84121	84121	I	0	“ He does n’t want me . ”
84137	84171	84093	84093	She	64	“ No . I do n’t buy it . I ’ve seen the way he looks at you , I ’ve heard the way he talks about you . The guy adores you . ”
84172	84176	84177	84177	I	0	“ Not enough , ”
84187	84220	84177	84177	I	0	“ He said things were moving too fast and it was making him feel bad . He hated all the sneaking around , but he did n’t want to tell the kids . ”

84236	84288	84233	84233	her	64	“ I could see if you were some strange woman he met at a bar somewhere that he would n’t want to bring you around his kids too soon . But he ’s known you for years . He ’s known this family forever . And his kids already love you . ”
84289	84299	84300	84300	I	0	“ I think that ’s part of the problem . ”
84306	84317	84300	84300	I	0	“ He ’s afraid they ’re too attached to me . ”
84318	84325	84177	84177	I	0	“ How is that a problem ? ”
84326	84357	84233	84233	her	64	“ It would n’t be if we wanted the same things in the future . But he claims he ’s never getting married again and does n’t want more kids . ”
84358	84365	84300	84300	I	0	“ Are you okay with that ? ”
84366	84375	84376	84376	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I mean … ”
84379	84423	84376	84376	I	0	“ Not really . I do want a husband and kids of my own someday . But it ’s not like I need them tomorrow ! Why ca n’t we see where this goes ? Why does he have to freak out now ? ”
84424	84441	84300	84300	I	0	“ Maybe he does n’t want to lead you on . Or lead the kids on . ”
84449	84482	84442	84442	Chloe	64	“ I mean , let ’s say it goes great for a year , and you start to get dreamy about a diamond ring and a big white dress . Then what ? ”
84483	84491	84492	84492	I	0	“ Then we could talk about it , ”
84504	84531	84492	84492	I	0	“ Okay , let ’s say you talk about it and he stands firm . There will be no second Mrs. Declan MacAllister . Then what ? ”
84537	84562	84492	84492	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Why ca n’t he just love me enough , goddammit ? And why are you on his side ? ”
84563	84635	84667	84667	Chloe	64	“ Oh , honey , I ’m not . I think he ’s crazy to give you up . I ’m only trying to help you see it ’s not that he does n’t feel what you do . But he ’s older and he ’s been through a lot more . He ’s not looking at this the same way you are . And he has a lot more baggage . ”
84636	84648	84690	84690	she	64	“ I know . Just forget it . It ’s hopeless . ”
84671	84679	84680	84680	She	64	“ It was hopeless from the start . ”
84855	84904	84842	84842	I	0	“ Oh , did n’t she tell you ? She ’s working in Traverse City this week at that coffee shop . She thought it would be a good idea to start there as soon as possible , learn the ropes before she started her own thing there . ”
84909	84935	84936	84936	She	84	“ I still think this is a crazy idea , and I ca n’t imagine what her father was thinking to encourage her , but … ”
84942	84954	84936	84936	She	84	“ I ’m just her mother , what do I know ? ”
84955	84966	84969	84969	her	84	“ So she ’s not working here at all anymore ? ”
84972	85033	84969	84969	her	84	“ No . On Sunday afternoon she came down and said that she really needed to start there as soon as possible , and could I please do without her starting Monday . I said I could , and I ’m looking for a replacement . You do n’t know anyone who ’d be good at reception , do you ? ”
85034	85045	85046	85046	I	0	“ Not offhand , but I ’ll think about it . ”
85260	85287	85254	85254	I	0	“ Hey , it ’s me . I ’m just wondering if you ’re still coming to watch the girls this week . Let me know . ”
85327	85334	85335	85335	I	0	“ I hope you ’re okay . ”
85491	85494	85495	85495	I	0	“ Hey , ”

85594	85597	85598	85598	She	1533	“ Fine . ”
85609	85615	85598	85598	She	1533	“ Are you liking it ? ”
85616	85619	85620	85620	She	1533	“ Mmhm . ”
85635	85640	85620	85620	She	1533	“ See you tomorrow . ”
85641	85646	85647	85647	She	1533	“ Frannie , wait . ”
85661	85666	85667	85667	I	0	“ I hate this , ”
85671	85691	85667	85667	I	0	“ Me too . If you want to hire someone else to watch the girls , I ’ll understand . ”
85696	85702	85692	85692	I	0	“ They ’d miss you . ”
85703	85710	85736	85736	She	1533	“ I ’ll miss them too . ”
85711	85727	85692	85692	I	0	“ To be honest , I was n’t even sure you ’d show up today . ”
85728	85735	85736	85736	She	1533	“ It was hard , but … ”
85742	85748	85736	85736	She	1533	“ I came for them . ”
85753	85774	85749	85749	I	0	“ Can you come one more time ? Tomorrow ? I ’ll start looking for a replacement for next week . ”
85775	85779	85780	85780	She	1533	“ Of course . ”
85783	85810	85780	85780	She	1533	“ I can tell them it ’s because of my new job at the coffee shop . That way they are n’t confused or … hurt . ”
85822	85837	85838	85838	She	1533	“ I ’ll handle it . You do n’t have to tell them anything . ”
85882	85892	85893	85893	she	1533	“ He does n’t like it when you yell , ”

86693	86735	86689	86689	Sawyer	64	“ It sure as hell does . And I suppose you have to make the most of what time you get here . It ’s not like you get any kind of guarantee when your number ’s gon na be up . ”

87390	87400	87401	87401	She	444	“ I guess I ’ll see you around then . ”
87530	87538	87540	87540	Felicity	50	“ Daddy , what are you doing ? ”

89677	89885	89886	89886	Dad	319	” Instead of answering , I put the radio on and turned up the volume . At home , the three girls gave me pouty faces and dirty looks before trudging upstairs to their bedrooms . I stayed in the kitchen and tried to make a grocery list , but when I saw Frannie ’s phone number in her handwriting on the notepad , I froze . Stared at it . Remembered the night she ’d written it down for me , how much fun I ’d had with her . She ’d taken a shitty day and made it amazing . She could make all my days amazing if I ’d let her … but I could n’t . Look how I ’d fucked it up already ! My kids were furious with me . Frannie could n’t even look at me . I was probably never going to have sex that good again in my life . And it would serve me right . I was a United States Marine , goddammit . I should have been stronger . I should have been able to resist her in the first place . I should have known that a woman like her could never be mine . “

90011	90017	90002	90003	an idiot	1629	” I blinked at her . “
90022	90023	90002	90003	an idiot	1629	” “
90029	90056	90002	90003	an idiot	1629	” She pointed her finger in that direction , and I had no choice but to follow the order . They trailed me to the couch . “
90060	90100	90002	90003	an idiot	1629	” Felicity commanded . I sat and leaned back , knees widespread and arms crossed , scowling like an angry teenager about to get lectured . They faced me with matching angry expressions and stubborn sets of their jaws . “
90107	90111	90112	90112	I	0	” Millie began . “
90115	90123	90112	90112	I	0	” I waved a hand toward her . “
90129	90130	90112	90112	I	0	” “
90136	90145	90146	90146	I	0	” said Winnie . I jerked my chin . “
90155	90156	90153	90153	Frannie	104	” “
90164	90194	90159	90159	you	0	” Millie yelled , sounding so much like me it was a little eerie ( although I probably would have used the word fuck somewhere in the sentence ) . “
90212	90213	90205	90205	we	1626	” “
90217	90218	90219	90219	Your	0	” “
90247	90253	90256	90256	you	0	” My spine snapped straight . “
90267	90282	90283	90283	Dad	53	” My daughters exchanged the mother of all eye rolls . Someone sighed dramatically . “
90287	90294	90283	90283	Dad	53	” Millie held out a palm . “
90302	90303	90295	90295	You	1631	” “
90312	90321	90295	90295	You	1631	” said Felicity . I looked at Winnie . “
90327	90331	90325	90325	Daddy	48	” she whispered . “
90342	90343	90334	90334	you	48	” “
90352	90356	90345	90345	I	0	” added Millie . “
90372	90383	90358	90358	I	0	” Felicity took off her glasses and held them up . “
90391	90399	90384	90384	I	0	” I shook my head in disbelief . “
90423	90424	90441	90441	her	1638	” “
90428	90432	90441	90441	her	1638	” Millie demanded . “
90443	90447	90434	90434	I	0	” I said . “
90465	90466	90467	90467	She	1638	” “
90474	90484	90467	90467	She	1638	” Millie raised her brows and tapped her foot . “
90508	90514	90498	90498	you	48	” I struggled for words . “
90586	90592	90580	90580	I	0	” They exchanged another look . “
90597	90601	90580	90580	I	0	” Millie said . “
90625	90631	90632	90632	I	0	” I shook my head . “
90650	90671	90635	90635	you	0	” I told them , feeling like I was breaking hearts two , three , and four within a week . “
90675	90749	90750	90750	I	0	” More toe tapping . Sighing , I fell back again , exhausted and depleted , and wishing I could crawl into bed and never get out . Her father was n’t an issue . We no longer worked together . The age difference did n’t seem that big a deal anymore . And my terrible ex was always going to be my terrible ex , with or without Frannie in our lives . “
90755	90756	90757	90757	Daddy	1643	” “
90759	90775	90757	90757	Daddy	1643	” Dropping the tough guy act , Millie dropped onto the couch next to me . “
90781	90790	90777	90777	you	1643	” Too miserable to lie , I nodded . “
90817	90832	90812	90812	You	1645	” Winnie sat on my other side and put a hand on my leg . “
90857	90867	90850	90850	he	94	” I looked at her and my throat tightened . “
90874	90875	90850	90850	he	94	” “
90885	90900	90902	90902	you	1645	” Felicity knelt in front of me and set her chin on my knee . “
90904	90905	90906	90906	I	0	” “
90911	90915	90906	90906	I	0	” I said . “
90932	90936	90923	90923	I	0	” Millie sighed . “
90942	90949	90923	90923	I	0	” I gave her a look . “
90995	91008	90984	90984	I	0	” No one spoke right away . Then Winnie sat up taller . “
91040	91048	91049	91049	You	0	” I looked at her in surprise . “
91063	91064	91053	91053	Winn	80	” “
91077	91081	91066	91066	you	48	” Millie said . “
91090	91091	91082	91082	We	1652	” “
91099	91111	91097	91097	Daddy	48	” Felicity smiled hopefully , clasping her hands beneath her chin . “
91118	91119	91097	91097	Daddy	48	” “
91131	91135	91122	91122	I	0	” I asked . “
91143	91144	91137	91137	you	0	” “
91147	91152	91137	91137	you	0	” Winnie said emphatically . “
91159	91160	91153	91153	We	1652	” “
91184	91280	91284	91284	you	1654	” Millie informed me seriously . I looked at all three of them and thought my heart was going to burst . Was it possible I could be the dad they needed and the man Frannie deserved all at once ? Could I be trusted not to mess up four lives ? Was it fair to ask Frannie to accept all of us and every ounce of emotional baggage we came with ? Could I ever be worth it ? I had no fucking clue , but right then I decided I had to try . “
91288	91289	91284	91284	you	1654	” “
91293	91302	91284	91284	you	1654	” Millie jumped up and clapped her hands . “
91305	91321	91284	91284	you	1654	” Winnie bounced excitedly . Felicity hopped to her feet and reached into her pocket . “
91332	91360	91325	91325	You	53	” She fished it out and handed it to me . Rising to my feet , I took it from her and closed my hand around it . “
91397	91398	91399	91399	I	0	” “
91407	91437	91399	91399	I	0	” offered Felicity . I opened my arms and they all swooped in , and I thanked God for all three of my smart , sweet , loving girls . “
91443	91510	91513	91513	you	1659	” Millie asked . I took a breath , nervous and slightly sick to my stomach . But the girls were right — I loved her , I was miserable without her , and if she ’d promise to forgive me for all the times I was less than she needed me to be , I ’d promise to be open to anything in the future . “
91516	91526	91513	91513	you	1659	” I looked at all three of their faces . “
91531	91532	91527	91527	I	0	” “
91538	91546	91536	91536	Dad	53	” Millie took one of my hands . “
91553	91559	91560	91560	We	1661	” Winnie took the other . “
91565	91566	91560	91560	We	1661	” “
91585	91598	91567	91567	We	1661	” Felicity said as she took off running for the back door . “
91606	91606	91567	91567	We	1661	”
91648	91651	91636	91636	I	0	“ What ? ”
91659	91671	91672	91672	I	0	“ I should have changed my clothes . I ’m wearing … ”
91681	91685	91672	91672	I	0	“ Pink glitter . ”
91686	91695	91696	91696	Felicity	50	“ Zip up your coat all the way , ”
91699	91702	91696	91696	Felicity	50	“ No ! ”
91707	91737	91703	91703	Millie	49	“ The shirt is a statement about love and healing hearts . Plus Frannie helped make it . He should show her that he ’s proud to wear it . ”
91744	91752	91738	91738	I	0	“ You ’re pretty smart for eleven . ”
91756	91762	91753	91753	She	49	“ I ’m almost twelve . ”
91770	91783	91763	91763	I	0	“ Do n’t remind me . Okay , let ’s do this . ”
91784	91794	91795	91795	Winnie	51	“ Daddy , what are you going to say ? ”
91808	91814	91795	91795	Winnie	51	“ I have no idea . ”
91815	91832	91833	91833	Felicity	50	“ I think you should tell her you ’re sorry for being a big fat jerk , ”
91848	91851	91841	91841	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
91852	91862	91863	91863	Millie	49	“ And maybe you should beg for her forgiveness , ”
91866	91882	91863	91863	Millie	49	“ On your knees or something . That ’s what they do in the movies . ”
91883	91893	91841	91841	I	0	“ I think I ’ll stay on my feet . ”
91894	91901	91902	91902	Winnie	51	“ Tell her she ’s pretty , ”
91905	91912	91913	91913	Felicity	50	“ Tell her she ’s perfect ! ”
91916	91923	91913	91913	Felicity	50	“ Tell her you love her . ”
91933	91946	91924	91924	Millie	49	“ That ’s important . She needs to hear you say that . ”
91952	91959	91960	91960	Winnie	51	“ I ’m going to die . ”
91963	91970	91960	91960	Winnie	51	“ Not , you ’re not . ”
91979	92003	92004	92004	She	49	“ You ’re not going to die . You ’re going to fix this and get her back — for all of us . ”
92029	92036	92016	92016	She	49	“ Daddy , it ’s locked . ”
92037	92043	92044	92044	Winnie	51	“ We ’re too late , ”
92047	92053	92044	92044	Winnie	51	“ The hell we are . ”
92083	92099	92100	92100	I	0	“ Frannie ? There ’s someone here to see you . Several people , actually . ”
92130	92135	92127	92127	his	124	“ To see me ? ”
92136	92149	92150	92150	His	124	“ That ’s what they said . A guy and some kids . ”
92158	92178	92150	92150	His	124	“ And the guy is wearing some kind of sparkly T - shirt . You better come up front . ”
92261	92264	92265	92265	I	0	“ Hi , ”
92269	92272	92265	92265	I	0	“ Hi . ”
92418	92421	92423	92423	Millie	49	“ Dad , ”
92431	92435	92423	92423	Millie	49	“ Say something . ”
92436	92441	92442	92442	Mack	104	“ I ’m trying . ”
92447	92458	92444	92444	his	104	“ This is n’t easy . Give me a second . ”
92459	92464	92465	92465	Miles	124	“ Take your time , ”
92468	92479	92465	92465	Miles	124	“ Miles , maybe we should give them some privacy ? ”
92494	92505	92507	92507	Miles	124	“ But Nat , something good is about to happen , ”
92509	92531	92507	92507	Miles	124	“ I can tell . A dude does n’t wear a glittery T - shirt for nothing . This is big . ”
92541	92544	92532	92532	Mack	104	“ Um . ”
92545	92548	92549	92549	Felicity	50	“ Dad . ”
92561	92567	92549	92549	Felicity	50	“ Come on , already . ”
92568	92571	92572	92572	Mack	104	“ Okay . ”
92597	92638	92592	92592	He	104	“ Frannie , I came here today to tell you something — well several things . First , that I ’m sorry . I know I hurt you , and I ’m so sorry . This is all my fault . ”
92643	92652	92639	92639	Miles	124	“ Taking all the blame . Nice move . ”
92653	92656	92657	92657	Natalie	112	“ Miles ! ”
92664	92671	92672	92672	Miles	124	“ What ? He needs encouragement , ”
92680	92691	92675	92675	He	124	“ Go on , man . You ’re doing fine . ”
92695	92698	92699	92699	he	104	“ Thanks , ”
92710	92735	92699	92699	he	104	“ Not only did I hurt you , but you were right : I did it for a stupid reason — I was afraid . ”
92741	92795	92738	92738	his	104	“ Fuck , I ’m still afraid . I feel like there ’s no way I can do this , be the best father possible and be the guy you want . There ’s only one of me , and half the time , I have no fucking idea what I ’m doing . ”
92796	92803	92804	92804	Miles	124	“ I hear that , brother . ”
92807	92834	92804	92804	Miles	124	“ Being a dad is the hardest thing I ’ve ever done . I ca n’t imagine what it would be like facing that job alone . ”
92835	92846	92738	92738	his	104	“ But you do n’t have to face it alone . ”
92863	92893	92851	92851	I	0	“ That ’s the thing , Mack . I do n’t expect you to divide your time , to try to be all things to all people at once . ”
92894	92901	92902	92902	he	104	“ I know you do n’t , ”
92909	92973	92902	92902	he	104	“ Just like I know I ’m going to fail you sometimes , and the kids sometimes , and myself sometimes . I ’ve never been a perfect man , but I felt like I had to be the perfect father , to make up for what they lost . And I thought that meant I had to put my own needs aside . ”
92978	92984	92974	92974	His	104	“ But I ca n’t . ”
92985	92992	92993	92993	I	0	“ You do n’t have to . ”
92998	93036	92993	92993	I	0	“ We can make it work , Mack . I know you ’re not perfect , and I know being a good dad is your most important priority , but you deserve to be happy , too . ”
93044	93048	93037	93037	I	0	“ Right girls ? ”
93049	93052	93053	93053	they	173	“ Right , ”
93056	93067	93053	93053	they	173	“ And he was n’t happy at all this week , ”
93072	93077	93079	93079	Winnie	51	“ He was grouchy , ”
93081	93085	93087	93087	Felicity	50	“ And mean , ”
93089	93100	93087	93087	Felicity	50	“ Come on , give him a break , girls . ”
93106	93145	93146	93146	He	124	“ He was lonely . He ’d walked away from Frannie because he thought he was doing the right thing , and he had to spend some time being miserable to realize what an idiot he ’d been . ”
93151	93156	93146	93146	He	124	“ Am I right ? ”
93160	93170	93171	93171	He	104	“ Yeah . And it did n’t take long . ”
93177	93220	93171	93171	He	104	“ I do n’t know where we end up . I do n’t know how all these pieces of my life are going to fit together . I do n’t know how you ’re going to put up with all my shit . ”
93221	93229	93232	93232	Millie	49	“ Do you have a swear jar ? ”
93237	93243	93244	93244	Mack	104	“ But I do know , ”
93256	93296	93248	93248	his	104	“ that my life is much better with you in it , and if you ’re willing to take this crazy journey with me — the back seat already full — I’m willing to see where this road leads . ”
93303	93309	93248	93248	his	104	“ Do you mean it ? ”
93310	93313	93248	93248	his	104	“ Yes . ”
93314	93320	93321	93321	Winnie	51	“ Because he loves you ! ”
93325	93330	93321	93321	Winnie	51	“ He told us ! ”
93331	93334	93340	93340	Felicity	50	“ Winnie ! ”
93347	93353	93340	93340	Felicity	50	“ What ? He diiiid . ”
93359	93365	93354	93354	Winnie	51	“ He should tell her . ”
93366	93371	93372	93372	I	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
93390	93396	93372	93372	I	0	“ This is more than — ”
93397	93402	93403	93403	Mack	104	“ She ’s right . ”
93424	93472	93473	93473	He	104	“ I told them , and I ’ll tell you . I love you , Frannie . I do n’t know if I ’m any good at it . God knows I failed in the past . But I love you . And when you love someone … ”
93490	93505	93473	93473	He	104	“ You want to be with them . I want to be with you . ”
93506	93511	93512	93512	Miles	124	“ Aw , dude . ”
93517	93523	93512	93512	Miles	124	“ You ’re killing me . ”
93524	93528	93533	93533	her	51	“ Kiss her ! ”
93536	93545	93533	93533	her	51	“ And not in the closet this time ! ”
93571	93578	93579	93579	Millie	49	“ Okay , that ’s enough , ”
93582	93588	93579	93579	Millie	49	“ Do n’t get gross . ”
93600	93609	93595	93595	I	0	“ Come here , girls . Group hug . ”
93631	93637	93638	93638	I	0	“ Thank you , girls , ”
93647	93680	93638	93638	I	0	“ This means everything to me . I want to be with your dad , but I want to be with you , too . I want us all to be together . ”
93681	93689	93690	93690	Millie	49	“ We love you too , Frannie , ”
93693	93701	93690	93690	Millie	49	“ You ’re part of our family . ”
93715	93721	93722	93722	he	124	“ That was fucking beautiful , ”
93725	93732	93733	93734	his wife	257	“ Miles ! Watch your language ! ”
93737	93744	93746	93746	Felicity	50	“ Oh , that ’s okay , ”
93751	93758	93746	93746	Felicity	50	“ We ’re used to it . ”
93844	93855	93856	93856	she	112	“ I ca n’t believe he came here that way , ”
93863	93870	93856	93856	she	112	“ Are you totally in shock ? ”
93871	93898	93860	93860	her	112	“ Pretty much . When I left his house yesterday , I was fairly certain things were done . He seemed unhappy but unwilling to budge . ”
93899	93912	93913	93913	She	112	“ Thank goodness for those girls , huh ? What smart kids . ”
93916	93942	93913	93913	She	112	“ Every time I think about that little one yelling , ‘ Because he loves you ! He told us ! ’ I crack up . ”
93958	93967	93943	93943	I	0	“ Winnie . She ’s such a doll . ”
93968	93977	93860	93860	her	112	“ So you get along with them all ? ”
93978	94018	93943	93943	I	0	“ A hundred percent . I know I ca n’t replace their mom , and there will probably come a day when I ’ll side with their dad on something and they ’ll hate me for it , but — ”
94019	94026	94027	94027	she	1693	“ Welcome to being a parent , ”
94030	94035	94036	94036	She	1693	“ Speaking of which . ”
94044	94055	94056	94056	I	0	“ This one is all kinds of crazy this afternoon . ”
94059	94068	94056	94056	I	0	“ It ’s been that kind of day . ”
94278	94285	94287	94287	Millie	49	“ Find beauty in ordinary things , ”
94289	94297	94299	94299	Felicity	50	“ You will live a happy life , ”
94301	94311	94313	94313	Mack	104	“ You will be hungry again in one hour , ”
94324	94330	94319	94319	Winnie	51	“ Can you read mine ? ”
94331	94334	94335	94335	I	0	“ Sure , ”
94338	94352	94335	94335	I	0	“ It says , ‘ When one door closes , another opens . ’ ”
94353	94359	94360	94360	she	51	“ What does that mean ? ”
94363	94391	94360	94360	she	51	“ Well , I think it means that you should n’t dwell on the bad stuff in life , because something good is about to come along . ”
94397	94405	94406	94406	Felicity	50	“ What does yours say , Frannie ? ”
94409	94419	94421	94421	Mack	104	“ Beware of single dads who ca n’t cook ? ”
94426	94430	94423	94423	Millie	49	“ For real . ”
94440	94449	94431	94431	I	0	“ Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . ”
94450	94455	94457	94457	Winnie	51	“ I like that , ”
94459	94467	94457	94457	Winnie	51	“ But what ’s a willing heart ? ”
94468	94477	94478	94478	I	0	“ A heart that ’s open to anything , ”
94486	94513	94478	94478	I	0	“ And guess what ? When I was young , I had three open - heart surgeries . So I think mine is open for sure . ”
94521	94529	94530	94530	Felicity	50	“ So nothing is impossible for you , ”
94541	94546	94534	94534	I	0	“ Nope . Nothing . ”
94584	94592	94593	94593	I	0	“ Are you sure this is okay ? ”
94610	94613	94614	94614	He	104	“ Positive . ”
94638	94643	94644	94644	I	0	“ This is nice , ”
94657	94661	94662	94662	He	104	“ It is . ”
94670	94678	94662	94662	He	104	“ Although I wish you were naked . ”
94682	94691	94679	94679	I	0	“ Not with the kids in the house . ”
94692	94711	94662	94662	He	104	“ I know . But I ’m going to get impatient with this high school stuff pretty soon . ”
94712	94717	94718	94718	I	0	“ We have time . ”
94731	94738	94739	94739	He	104	“ I ’m not going anywhere . ”
94747	94772	94739	94739	He	104	“ I ’m not either . Does n’t mean I do n’t want to rip your clothes off and fuck you senseless right now . ”
94773	94779	94782	94782	he	104	“ You ’re so romantic . ”
94793	94818	94782	94782	he	104	“ Sorry . But beneath my pink glittery heart T - shirt is an animal with a hairy chest and a hard - on . ”
94819	94823	94831	94831	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? ”
94842	94852	94853	94853	He	104	“ What do you know ? You ’re right . ”
94865	94881	94856	94856	I	0	“ Are you sure we ca n’t sneak into my bedroom for a few minutes ? ”
94891	94901	94902	94902	He	104	“ Wo n’t that feel so good inside you ? ”
94930	94946	94947	94947	he	104	“ Do n’t you want my mouth on you ? We can be so quiet , ”
94956	94967	94947	94947	he	104	“ Come on . Let me make you feel good . ”

95012	95018	95007	95007	I	0	“ I love you too . ”
95019	95057	95060	95060	I	0	“ So come to bed with me . I ’ve missed you so much . And I promise I wo n’t always be so terrible — we’ll behave tomorrow night . Tonight , let ’s give in . ”
95162	95189	95159	95159	Winnie	51	“ Frannie should just move in here . Then she would n’t have to leave so early in the morning and she could make breakfast sometimes . ”
95190	95193	95194	95194	Millie	49	“ Totally , ”
95277	95311	95265	95265	he	104	“ Not only are you a much better cook than me , but you know how to do all kinds of braids , you smell better , and you ’re much more patient . ”
95312	95323	95324	95324	I	0	“ And you ’re sure it ’s what you want ? ”
95464	95469	95478	95478	he	104	“ Are you kidding ? ”
95489	95514	95478	95478	he	104	“ Of course it ’s what I want . This house would n’t even feel like home without you anymore . You belong here . ”
95521	95534	95478	95478	he	104	“ I used to dream of hearing you say that to me . ”
95535	95543	95548	95548	his	104	“ Then tell me you ’ll stay . ”
95572	95577	95561	95561	his	104	“ I ’ll stay . ”
95650	95660	95661	95661	I	0	“ What ? How am I supposed to pack ? ”
95669	95695	95696	95697	The girls	173	“ Pack for an elegant destination . Not the beach . Not the mountains . Not the desert . That ’s all I ’m saying . ”
95742	95746	95739	95739	Felicity	50	“ Bon voyage ! ”
95752	95758	95748	95748	Millie	49	“ Do n’t ruin it ! ”
95759	95785	95793	95793	he	1726	“ I did n’t ! That ’s what you say when someone goes on a trip , even if they ’re not going to France ! ”
95808	95819	95793	95793	he	1726	“ Oh my God ! Do you have my passport ? ”
95820	95826	95827	95827	I	0	“ Of course I do . ”
95839	95851	95827	95827	I	0	“ This is too much . It ’s just a birthday . ”
95852	95896	95897	95897	I	0	“ It ’s not . It ’s a chance for me to do something for you and show you how much I appreciate all you do for me . And it was time for you to get a stamp in that passport already . ”
95900	95910	95897	95897	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe this . Pinch me ! ”
95911	95927	95928	95928	He	1727	“ I ’d be happy to , but you ’re not going to wake up . ”
95939	95945	95928	95928	He	1727	“ This is real life . ”
96129	96132	96133	96133	I	0	“ Mack . ”
96138	96146	96133	96133	I	0	“ No way . You did n’t . ”
96319	96328	96310	96310	Mack	104	“ So ? Is it everything you expected ? ”
96333	96351	96329	96329	I	0	“ More . I ’m only sorry the kids are n’t here . They ’d love this ! ”
96352	96364	96310	96310	Mack	104	“ We ’ll bring them back someday . How about that ? ”
96365	96374	96375	96375	I	0	“ Do you think we ’ll come back ? ”
96397	96421	96375	96375	I	0	“ Of course I do . We ’ll want to show them exactly where we were when I asked you to marry me . ”
96427	96430	96422	96422	I	0	“ What ? ”
96444	96454	96455	96455	he	1752	“ The box would n’t fit in my pocket , ”
96459	96477	96455	96455	he	1752	“ I did n’t plan that part very well . Which brings me to my next point . ”
96483	96538	96478	96478	He	1752	“ I ’m no prince , Frannie . I ’m stubborn , I ’m impatient , I have a foul mouth and a lot of fucking baggage . And I come attached to three small humans who run me ragged every day . But I love you more than I ’ve ever loved anyone . ”
96539	96546	96547	96547	I	0	“ I love you , too . ”
96590	96599	96600	96600	He	1752	“ Then I have a question for you . ”
96613	96667	96600	96600	He	1752	“ I ca n’t promise to build you a castle like this , or take you to Paris every year , or even clean up my mouth . But I can promise to spend every day of my life , and every night , treating you like a fucking queen — I’m sorry . ”
96672	96688	96668	96668	He	1752	“ A regular queen . Jesus Christ , I ca n’t even propose without cursing . ”
96697	96718	96689	96689	I	0	“ It ’s okay . I know exactly who you are , and I would n’t change you for anything . ”
96719	96728	96729	96729	I	0	“ Does that mean you ’ll marry me ? ”
96739	96747	96748	96748	He	1752	“ Yes . I ’ll marry you . ”
96769	96780	96781	96781	he	1752	“ God , I ’m so glad that ’s done , ”
96784	96795	96781	96781	he	1752	“ Why ? Did you think I ’d say no ? ”
96796	96851	96888	96888	He	1752	“ Not really , I was just afraid I ’d fuck it up somehow . Lose the ring , forget what I wanted to say , screw up the directions to get here . There was a lot depending on my ability to get things right , and I do n’t always trust myself . ”
96852	96863	96781	96781	he	1752	“ Well , you should . You did it perfectly . ”
96876	96883	96871	96871	I	0	“ I could n’t be happier . ”
96884	96887	96888	96888	He	1752	“ Good . ”
96893	96914	96915	96915	I	0	“ Now we should call home , because I told the girls they could stay up until you said yes . ”
96918	96922	96915	96915	I	0	“ They knew ? ”
96923	96977	96871	96871	I	0	“ Only after we left . I did n’t trust them to keep the secret , so I called them while you were in the shower yesterday and told them it was happening . But they ’ve known for a while I wanted to ask . And Millie helped me choose the ring . ”
96978	96982	96915	96915	I	0	“ She did ? ”
96991	96998	96999	96999	I	0	“ Mmhm . Millie and April . ”
97002	97014	96999	96999	I	0	“ We ’re so lucky to have family like we do . ”
97015	97028	96871	96871	I	0	“ We are . And maybe we can even add to it . ”
97039	97046	97047	97047	He	1755	“ Did I hear that right ? ”
97050	97070	97047	97047	He	1755	“ I figure I ’m not that old . Might be fun to give the girls a little brother . ”
97071	97075	97076	97076	He	1755	“ Or sister . ”
97079	97090	97076	97076	He	1755	“ Um … a house with four girls in it ? ”
97098	97107	97093	97093	I	0	“ Five . Do n’t forget your wife . ”
97111	97131	97108	97108	He	1755	“ We ’re going to need more space . And I ’m going to need a bigger swear jar . ”
97132	97149	97165	97165	his	1755	“ Relax , babe . It ’s gon na be okay . I ’ve got you . ”
97150	97157	97158	97158	He	1755	“ We ’ve got each other . ”
97171	97181	97158	97158	He	1755	“ And it ’s only going to get better . ”
