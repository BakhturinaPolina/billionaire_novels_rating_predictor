2619	2631	2616	2616	Evie	61	“ Would n’t you rather play it safe and do both ? ”

3161	3211	3212	3212	she	61	“ You know . When you ’re straddling him but he ’s holding your hips and like , slamming up into you ? It takes a shit load of core strength to go at it like that for awhile , which is why the eight - pack is essential , ”
3220	3246	3212	3212	she	61	“ I ’m serious , Aly . You know you want that Superman sex . Especially since you lost your good vibrator to the fire . ”
3247	3255	3212	3212	she	61	“ Ugh . Do n’t remind me . ”
3256	3265	3266	3266	Evie	61	“ I know , it ’s a tragedy , ”
3269	3325	3266	3266	Evie	61	“ But that just means you deserve a good lay tonight . Get some good dancing in , have dirty , wild sex with some stud , then pass out on this five thousand dollar mattress here . No way in hell you do n’t get at least six hours of sleep after all that . ”
3332	3354	3326	3326	I	0	“ Fine . If I find a guy with an eight - pack tonight , I ’ll go home with him . ”

3383	3408	3377	3377	I	0	“ Oh , please – who cares about personality ? It ’s a one - night stand . You ’ll never see him again ! ”
3409	3446	3447	3447	I	0	“ Yeah , well , I need to trust him enough to go home with him , ‘ cause there is no way in hell I ’m having sex with some guy in Emmett ’s house . ”

3463	3467	3468	3468	Evie	61	“ Fair enough , ”
3480	3509	3468	3468	Evie	61	“ Now hurry up and put on these fuck - me heels . We got eight - packs to hunt for , and time ’s a wastin ’ . ”

3867	3883	3884	3884	Evie	61	“ It ’s okay , the dress is tight enough to keep the girls contained ! ”

4898	4901	4902	4902	he	292	“ What ? ”
4905	4937	4902	4902	he	292	“ Cut me some slack , I thought I was alone in here – I definitely did n’t expect a fucking gorgeous blonde to walk out playing with her own tits . ”

6483	6528	6529	6529	I	0	“ No , you ’ve been riled up . You ’re just trying to pretend otherwise because you do n’t want to believe that some stranger at a club is actually tempting you to break whatever rule you have about one - night stands . ”

8778	8800	8801	8801	Julian	73	“ You said you were n’t going to be in the Hamptons even once this summer despite owning a house here ? ”
8804	8818	8801	8801	Julian	73	“ I guess we can say this is karma for lying to Mom . ”
8819	8857	8918	8918	Julian	73	“ Maybe if I was n’t completely joking when I said it . I did n’t think she ’d believe that I ’d be gone the whole damned summer . Have I ever been away that long ? ”
8858	8872	8801	8801	Julian	73	“ No , but why did you say it in the first place ? ”
8873	8902	8801	8801	Julian	73	“ Knee - jerk reaction ? She literally emailed me a list of her friends ’ daughters who were visiting either the Hamptons or the city this summer . ”
8903	8917	8918	8918	Julian	73	“ I take it she wanted you to ‘ show them around ? ’ ”
8938	8985	8986	8986	I	0	“ Yes , and you know by ‘ show them around , ’ she means entertain the idea of making one of them my future wife . And here I thought she ’d relax on the marriage and grandkids thing once you got married to Sara , ”
9032	9048	9049	9049	Julian	73	“ Well , I think my shotgun wedding left something to be desired for Mom , ”
9065	9080	9049	9049	Julian	73	“ Yeah , about that . That was a dick move on your part . ”
9081	9097	9049	9049	Julian	73	“ Forgive me . I did n’t feel like waiting to call Sara my wife . ”
9098	9107	9108	9108	I	0	“ God , you ’re soft these days , ”
9131	9138	9125	9125	Julian	73	“ Why are you throwing things ? ”
9139	9146	9049	9049	Julian	73	“ I ca n’t read that . ”
9147	9164	9165	9165	I	0	“ Well , if anyone could manage to graduate college illiterate , it would be you . ”
9171	9208	9165	9165	I	0	“ I mean I ca n’t concentrate , asshole . All I can think about is Aly , and I have no idea how the hell you expect me to wait all day to see her . ”
9209	9217	9218	9218	Julian	73	“ She runs a business , Emmett , ”
9233	9296	9218	9218	Julian	73	“ She already hates you too , so if you want any chance of convincing her to stay for the summer , the last thing you should do is bring your drama to her place of work . Besides , you clearly need the time to cool off from … whatever the hell it was that happened between you two last night . ”
9306	9316	9317	9317	I	0	“ Yeah , you ’re not wrong about that , ”
9388	9391	9392	9392	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
9401	9429	9398	9398	his	73	“ Yeah , on that note , I ’m leaving . I ’d prefer not to sit here and watch you get actively hard over Aly Stanton . ”
9430	9449	9398	9398	his	73	“ You ’re leaving because this is the time every week that you pick up Sara from yoga . ”
9450	9454	9398	9398	his	73	“ Also true . ”
9455	9489	9398	9398	his	73	“ You know I ’d be pissed about losing all my closest friends to marriage , but watching a work - obsessed sociopath like yourself get whipped has been great entertainment for me . ”
9490	9494	9495	9495	I	0	“ Fuck off . ”
9498	9530	9495	9495	I	0	“ And you wonder why I ’m stuck hanging out with an asshole like Drew . It ’s because you , Lukas – all my closest friends are wifed up now . ”
9531	9575	9576	9576	Julian	73	“ Well , hopefully by some miracle , you ’ll be able to join the club soon . In the meantime , I ’m out . Your friend has just arrived and I ’m not interested in being seen with him right now , ”
9620	9624	9613	9613	Julian	73	“ Mr. Maddox . ”
9625	9629	9584	9584	he	73	“ Mr. Hoult . ”
9630	9642	9643	9643	Julian	73	“ I ’m going to pretend I never saw you here , ”
9651	9677	9643	9643	Julian	73	“ But for the record , I do n’t endorse this . I trust you ’ll be home in time for your PT appointment tomorrow . ”
9678	9688	9689	9689	Drew	72	“ Yes , sir , you bet your ass , ”
9745	9753	9754	9754	Drew	72	“ How you holding up , buddy ? ”
9792	9816	9817	9817	I	0	“ So you got pictures of this girl or what ? Because I have trouble believing she ’s as hot as you say . ”
9820	9833	9817	9817	I	0	“ In that case , I look forward to you meeting her . ”
9834	9857	9754	9754	Drew	72	“ Well , if she ’s even half as good - looking as you claim , I look forward to it too . ”
9858	9895	9948	9948	he	72	“ Actually , I just decided that you ’re never meeting her . And if you ever try anything on her I ’ll make sure you ’re on the DL for the rest of the year . ”
9896	9911	9817	9817	I	0	“ At which point your brother would kill you . The team needs me . ”
9912	9930	9754	9754	Drew	72	“ Yeah , which is why you ’re partying in the Hamptons instead of rehabbing your injury . ”
9931	9944	9945	9945	Drew	72	“ It ’s a muscle contusion . It ’ll heal by tomorrow , ”
10050	10056	10057	10057	Drew	72	“ The hell was that ? ”
10072	10075	10069	10069	I	0	“ What ? ”
10076	10094	10069	10069	I	0	“ She was hot as all fuck and she was basically thrusting her tits in your face . ”
10095	10105	10138	10138	he	72	“ Yeah ? I do n’t remember that happening . ”
10106	10133	10069	10069	I	0	“ You would n’t . Your eyes were attached to your phone like a fuckin ’ high school girl . Who are you texting ? Her ? ”
10135	10137	10138	10138	he	72	“ her ”
10165	10184	10160	10160	he	72	“ I got her number from my mom . I was checking if she responded to my text . ”
10185	10192	10224	10224	he	72	“ What ’d your text say ? ”
10193	10215	10160	10160	he	72	“ I was asking if I could see her at work . Or if I ’d just see her at home . ”
10216	10219	10224	10224	he	72	“ Christ . ”
10237	10269	10224	10224	he	72	“ Since when did you get this desperate ? You ’re the one who preaches the whole ignore - them - till - they - come - to - you trick . ”
10270	10281	10160	10160	he	72	“ Yeah , that does n’t really apply to her . ”
10282	10303	10304	10304	I	0	“ Why not ? And if you say ‘ because she ’s different , ’ I ’m going to hurl . ”
10316	10325	10326	10326	he	72	“ Jesus fuck . So she is different , ”
10333	10343	10326	10326	he	72	“ Magical tits aside , what ’s so special ? ”
10769	10786	10787	10787	I	0	“ I do n’t know , man , I ’ve just known her my whole life , ”
11303	11315	11316	11316	I	0	“ You really need to stop being so delighted about this , ”
11333	11351	11352	11352	I	0	“ How would you feel if you hooked up with basically your high school bully ? Huh ? ”
11355	11385	11352	11352	I	0	“ It ’s horrifying , Evie . I keep having these moments where I ca n’t breathe . I feel like I ’m going to actually die of embarrassment . ”
11386	11391	11392	11392	Evie	61	“ What ? Why ? ”
11416	11475	11476	11476	Evie	61	“ Why be embarrassed about wanting Emmett if he wants you back ? Seriously , Aly , what happened between you two last night was hotter than any porn I ’ve ever watched in my life , and that ’s saying a lot because Mike and I have n’t had sex in three months , and I ’ve – ”
11491	11504	11505	11505	she	61	“ And I ’ve been watching a lot of porn , assholes ! ”
11522	11567	11505	11505	she	61	“ Honest to God , Aly . This could wind up being an amazing summer of nonstop dirty , sweaty hate - fucking for you . And that could very well be what you need to fall asleep every night . Right ? Right ? ”
11580	11615	11568	11568	I	0	“ Evie . Have we forgotten that my hatred for Emmett is like , real hatred and not foreplay hatred ? You do remember that I despise him , right ? Like , truly ? ”
11628	11657	11658	11658	she	61	“ Yeah , but ca n’t we agree that he was a kid when he tortured you like that and he ’s probably grown out of that shit ? ”
11661	11668	11658	11658	she	61	“ It ’s not that simple . ”
11669	11706	11658	11658	she	61	“ It could be ! Half your relationship was comprised of getting each other in trouble with your teachers or your parents , but now that you ’re adults , none of that shit exists anymore ! ”
11707	11719	11720	11720	I	0	“ Yeah , but what about … the thing he did ? ”
11915	11926	11927	11927	I	0	“ You know what – do n’t answer that question , ”
11931	11934	11927	11927	I	0	“ Just … ”
11948	11989	11941	11941	I	0	“ Tell me my next move , Evie . He ’s been texting me all day about wanting to see me , and I do n’t know what to do or say because my brain is completely broken right now . ”
11990	11993	11994	11994	Evie	61	“ Fine . ”
12020	12023	12031	12031	she	61	“ Aly . ”
12038	12089	12031	12031	she	61	“ If we ’re being real here … financially speaking , you ca n’t afford anything else . As both your business partner and your closest friend , I can tell you objectively that your best move here is to do anything you can to make things work with Emmett . ”
12103	12119	12096	12096	she	61	“ Even if it means wasting his hotness and forcing him to be completely platonic . ”
12127	12145	12120	12120	I	0	“ Somehow , I do n’t think the platonic thing is going to work after last night . ”
12146	12206	12207	12207	I	0	“ Well , it ’s either that or move in with me and Mike . Because you ca n’t afford to rent even a motel room from now till Labor Day , Aly . Even the shittiest one that ’s close enough to work is going to cost you well over five grand for the rest of the summer . ”
12350	12364	12365	12365	I	0	“ So basically , I have no choice but to stay with Emmett , ”
12368	12371	12372	12372	Evie	61	“ Yep ! ”
12382	12390	12391	12391	she	61	“ Oh , come on , Aly , ”
12398	12452	12391	12391	she	61	“ It ’s going to be fine . I ’m sure that you two can coexist platonically under one roof . And if for some reason , you fall out of the shower one day and land on his cock , that wo n’t be the worst thing in the world , right ? ”
12572	12587	12590	12590	her	61	“ Oh my God , hi . Hi ! Where ’d you come from ? ”
12772	12777	12760	12760	Ozzy	71	“ Oh . Hi . ”
12799	12802	12803	12803	I	0	“ Hey , ”
12897	12900	12886	12886	I	0	“ Aly … ”
12901	12911	12914	12914	her	61	“ Wait , Emmett . Let me start first . ”
12926	12931	12914	12914	her	61	“ About last night … ”
12951	12958	12945	12945	she	61	“ It was a big mistake . ”
12963	12970	12971	12971	I	0	“ What makes you say that ? ”
12987	12998	12999	12999	she	61	“ Wait . Just … stay there for a second , ”
13003	13206	13207	13207	She	376	“ Because before you say anything else , I just need to say this : I know I ’m the one who ’s in a bad situation right now , and I ’m the one who needs the favor of crashing here , so I ’m really in no place to make demands about how you live in your own house . Beggars ca n’t be choosers , and I know that … but I also know I ca n’t survive under the same roof as you unless we agree to be strictly platonic and pretend like last night did n’t happen at all . It ’s just too weird and irresponsible , and I ’d probably move out the second something inappropriate happened again , so I might as well just tell you this now . If you ’re for some reason okay with us being friends , I ’m going to officially ask you if I can stay here for the summer , because Lord knows I need it . But if you do n’t think that ’s possible , I ’ll pack my bags now and I promise you wo n’t have to hear from me again . Okay ? ”
13247	13255	13256	13256	she	376	“ Did you … process all that ? ”
13260	13267	13256	13256	she	376	“ Emmett . Please say something . ”
13348	13362	13341	13341	I	0	“ It ’s all good , Aly . We can keep it platonic . ”
13466	13469	13473	13473	her	61	“ Really ? ”
13514	13517	13518	13518	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
13522	13525	13518	13518	I	0	“ Really . ”
13526	13536	13555	13555	I	0	“ That wo n’t … be hard for you ? ”
13560	13575	13576	13576	I	0	“ Should n’t be . I ’m pretty famous for having a short memory , ”
13597	13619	13620	13620	he	73	“ Something pisses you off and a second later , you ’re fine again . It ’s like a magic trick , ”
13753	13770	13771	13771	Aly	61	“ I … wow . I ca n’t believe you ’re being so cool about this , ”
13782	13812	13777	13777	she	61	“ I mean – I did n’t mean it like that . I ’m just … I ’m a little surprised . But extremely grateful . Okay . Wow . ”
13835	13864	13865	13865	she	61	“ I ca n’t even begin to describe how much you ’re saving my ass , Emmett . So thank you . A million times , thank you , ”
13882	13896	13865	13865	she	61	“ I would give you a hug but you ’re … all sweaty . ”
13982	13993	13994	13994	I	0	“ No worries . I ’ll take a rain check , ”
13997	14002	13994	13994	I	0	“ Ha - ha ! ”
14030	14038	14025	14025	I	0	“ Anyway , I should shower now . ”
14039	14050	14051	14051	Aly	61	“ Oh yeah – sorry ! Go do your thing ! ”
14169	14198	14199	14199	he	56	“ These are all the people who write the biggest checks to my foundation , so I ca n’t flake on their parties without looking like an asshole , ”
14245	14247	14249	14249	he	56	“ no ”
14258	14266	14267	14267	he	56	“ Aly . It ’s all good , ”
14676	14694	14695	14695	I	0	“ It literally says no flip flops or shorts , Emmett , and I ’m wearing both , ”
14739	14752	14753	14753	he	56	“ Yeah , I do n’t think it ’ll be a problem , ”
14765	14775	14753	14753	he	56	“ Yeah , except what makes you so sure ? ”
14789	14796	14797	14797	I	0	“ Because I own this place . ”
14925	14943	14919	14919	they	1607	“ Emmett , do you remember my name ? I bet you do n’t remember my name ! ”
14984	14991	14996	14997	the manager	417	“ just send some things out . ”
15015	15021	14996	14997	the manager	417	“ no , thank you , ”
15042	15049	15050	15050	I	0	“ Guess some things never change , ”
15053	15059	15050	15050	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
15060	15078	15079	15079	I	0	“ All that just now was pretty much what high school looked like from my vantage point , ”
15085	15125	15126	15126	Emmett	56	“ You walking down the hall , girls fawning over you , and then someone coming up and asking if you have everything you need – usually one of my friends making sure that she did your homework right . ”
15129	15155	15126	15126	Emmett	56	“ I still get attention from women , but I can pretty much assure you that everything else about me has changed since high school . ”
15156	15159	15160	15160	I	0	“ Really . ”
15175	15184	15160	15160	I	0	“ That ’s kind of hard to believe . ”
15185	15204	15205	15205	He	56	“ Why ? Everyone changes after high school . I mean look at you . You ’ve changed … ”
15210	15217	15207	15207	his	56	“ A lot since high school . ”
15252	15267	15268	15268	I	0	“ Yes , you ’re right . My hair is long and blonde again , ”
15296	15326	15293	15293	Emmett	56	“ Actually , yeah , that ’s a pretty huge change . I ’m pretty sure it ’s the only reason I did n’t recognize you that night we – ”
15327	15332	15333	15333	My	0	“ Ah , ah . ”
15354	15359	15360	15360	Emmett	56	“ Oh . Right , ”
15382	15387	15375	15375	I	0	“ Change of topic . ”
15388	15404	15405	15405	I	0	“ Yes . Let ’s go back to how you ’ve changed since high school , ”
15412	15415	15409	15409	Emmett	56	“ Fine . ”
15419	15444	15445	15445	Emmett	56	“ Well , for starters I do n’t play football anymore , and that was a pretty big part of my identity back then , ”
15448	15467	15445	15445	Emmett	56	“ Plus , I ’m way more responsible now since , you know . I have a kid . ”
15474	15486	15487	15487	I	0	“ You do ? Oh God , when did that happen ? ”
15514	15523	15501	15501	Emmett	56	“ Yeah … I was talking about Ozzy . ”
15524	15527	15528	15528	I	0	“ Oh . ”
15535	15555	15532	15532	he	56	“ But good to know that you ’d react to me having a kid with that kind of horror . ”
15556	15579	15580	15580	I	0	“ Oh my God , I ’m sorry . I just … ca n’t imagine you being responsible for another human life , ”
15594	15621	15591	15591	Emmett	56	“ Hey , believe it or not , I ’m a good caretaker . And someday , I ’m going to be a damned good father . ”
15622	15630	15631	15631	I	0	“ Oh – of course you are ! ”
15647	15676	15677	15677	I	0	“ I mean you ’re a good dad to Ozzy , obviously , and you did have pretty much the best possible role model in the dad department , ”
15809	15812	15813	15813	I	0	“ Emmett … ”
15823	15830	15818	15818	he	56	“ It ’s okay , Aly . ”
15848	15870	15871	15871	I	0	“ No … it ’s not . You messaged me on Facebook that week , and I did n’t even answer , ”
15898	15932	15896	15896	Fuck	82	“ Emmett , I ’m so sorry . Regardless of what happened between us , we were always like family , so that was the worst time I could have possibly ignored you . ”
15933	15955	15956	15956	Emmett	56	“ It ’s fine , Aly . We were kids and we were both in the eye of our own storm , ”
15972	16035	15968	15968	he	56	“ Oh , that was just what my mom said back then . She said however bad I was feeling , it did n’t mean that you did n’t have pain of your own to deal with . Everyone ’s got their own lives to live . And honestly , it was better for me to learn that sooner rather than later . ”
16121	16129	16130	16130	I	0	“ Thank you for being so understanding , ”
16138	16163	16130	16130	I	0	“ Like your mom explained , I was just … going through such a hard time because of that whole thing between us and – ”
16164	16168	16130	16130	I	0	“ About that – ”
16169	16172	16173	16173	I	0	“ No . ”
16184	16189	16190	16190	I	0	“ Let ’s not , ”
16193	16227	16228	16228	I	0	“ Right ? I mean it ’s our first time having dinner together as adults , so should n’t we just … try to enjoy our night instead of talking about the past ? ”
16267	16279	16280	16280	he	56	“ We can talk about whatever you want to talk about , ”
16306	16313	16314	16314	Emmett	56	“ Easy . Drink some water , ”
16322	16326	16314	16314	Emmett	56	“ Thank you , ”
16379	16388	16389	16389	Emmett	56	“ Breathe , Aly . You good now ? ”
16440	16452	16457	16457	I	0	“ Oh my God – Seafood Girl ? Is that you ? ”
16587	16602	16603	16603	Britt	84	“ Oh my God , so hilarious to see you here of all places , ”
16613	16636	16637	16637	she	84	“ Are you catering some event ? Did you meet my bestie Emmett Hoult ? Is n’t he just dee - vine ? ”
16859	16888	16889	16889	he	56	“ Actually , Britt , Aly here is one of my oldest friends . She ’s the only person I ’ve pretty much known since I was born , ”
16899	16916	16889	16889	he	56	“ Oh . Is that right ? So she ’s known you longer than I have ? ”
16933	16977	16978	16978	she	84	“ I ’ve been BFF with Emmett for like , ten years now . I interned at the events place that did his fraternity ’s Black and White ball , and I guess we pretty much hit it off from there , right ? ”
17006	17016	16994	16994	Emmett	56	“ Yes , Britt . I guess we did . ”
17017	17045	17046	17046	Britt	84	“ Mm - hm . And – oh ! Speaking of events , I happen to be planning the party for Emmett ’s big fundraiser next month , ”
17054	17080	17046	17046	Britt	84	“ I ’m not even exaggerating when I say it ’s going to be the event of the summer , so you should totally come . ”
17095	17105	17106	17106	she	84	“ But definitely do n’t wear that . Right ? ”
17116	17132	17106	17106	she	84	“ Do n’t worry . Aly ’s got some pretty killer dresses in her arsenal . ”
17165	17175	17176	17176	she	84	“ Oop ! Looks like my date ’s here ! ”
17211	17218	17208	17208	Britt	84	“ Emmett , you know Natalie . ”
17219	17230	17231	17231	Emmett	56	“ Of course . How have you been , Natalie ? ”
17301	17315	17316	17316	Britt	84	“ Ookay . Maybe go a lil ’ subtler next time , babe , ”
17328	17349	17350	17350	she	85	“ Guess I ’ll escort her away . But talk soon , both of you ! Have a good evening ! ”
17399	17402	17403	17403	he	56	“ What ? ”
17407	17423	17403	17403	he	56	“ That was actually going to be my question because what the heck was that ? ”
17428	17439	17424	17424	Emmett	56	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re talking about . ”
17440	17462	17463	17463	I	0	“ I ’m talking about the girl you apparently pissed off so bad she can only yell at you via text , ”
17466	17479	17463	17463	I	0	“ Something tells me she ’s a particularly scorned ex of yours . ”
17480	17502	17424	17424	Emmett	56	“ She ’s not . I ’m not sure you can call any of the women I ’ve been with exes . ”
17503	17516	17424	17424	Emmett	56	“ Why ? You ’re still actively sleeping with all of them ? ”
17517	17536	17537	17537	Emmett	56	“ No . More like I do n’t sleep with anyone for long enough to become a boyfriend , ”
17540	17551	17537	17537	Emmett	56	“ Well , how long were you with Natalie for ? ”
17552	17585	17586	17586	I	0	“ I was never with her – we spent a little more than a week hooking up . And I did tell her before we started that I do n’t do relationships . ”
17591	17597	17586	17586	I	0	“ You really do n’t ? ”
17598	17603	17537	17537	Emmett	56	“ You seem surprised . ”
17604	17624	17625	17625	I	0	“ Well , the fact that you give official disclaimers before even hooking up with someone is pretty serious , ”
17628	17660	17625	17625	I	0	“ Plus , you ’ve just always been the kind of guy who likes having someone take care of you . That was definitely the case in high school at least . ”
17785	17803	17804	17804	Emmett	56	“ Yeah , well , I ’ve learned how to take care of myself since high school , ”
17815	17826	17804	17804	Emmett	56	“ That ’s just a part of being an adult . ”
17827	17841	17804	17804	Emmett	56	“ So is learning how to commit to someone , is n’t it ? ”
17842	17850	17804	17804	Emmett	56	“ I do n’t have the time . ”
17851	17868	17869	17869	I	0	“ Yeah , what with the grueling nine - to - five you do n’t have , ”
17872	17890	17869	17869	I	0	“ I ca n’t imagine that your mom does n’t give you a hard time about this . ”
17891	17915	17944	17944	his	56	“ She does , but that does n’t change the fact that I have much more important priorities than being in a relationship . ”
17916	17923	17944	17944	his	56	“ Oh yeah ? Like what ? ”
17924	17936	17937	17937	Emmett	56	“ Nothing I feel the need to talk about , Aly , ”
17963	17972	17960	17960	I	0	“ Oh . Okay . That ’s cool , ”
18051	18054	18055	18055	I	0	“ Well … ”
18070	18083	18084	18084	I	0	“ I ’m totally with you on the no relationship thing anyway , ”
18097	18105	18092	18092	Emmett	56	“ Yeah ? And why is that ? ”
18106	18116	18117	18117	I	0	“ Because like you said , bigger priorities exist , ”
18120	18149	18117	18117	I	0	“ I ’ve got a restaurant to run , you ’ve got … whatever your job is . So fuck relationships . Who needs ‘ em ? Right ? ”
18180	18186	18187	18187	he	56	“ Yeah . Fuck relationships , ”
18190	18200	18187	18187	he	56	“ Sex will do in the meantime . Right ? ”
18346	18363	18364	18364	he	72	“ For Christ ’s sake , E , she goes to bed at 10PM every night , ”
18401	18429	18430	18430	Drew	72	“ Are you really going to miss out on Iain ’s birthday party that I planned just to spend an hour asking this girl about her day ? ”
18484	18519	18520	18520	Drew	72	“ Look , if you ’re not fucking her , you ’re not allowed to stay home for her . That ’s just the rule . I do n’t care how hot she is , ”
18528	18555	18525	18525	he	72	“ Wait . Actually that ’s not true – I do . Are you ever going to show me a damned picture ? Send it now . ”
18556	18559	18525	18525	he	72	“ No . ”
18560	18570	18571	18571	My	0	“ Then I ’ll just have to meet her . ”
18579	18593	18576	18576	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m never going to let you go anywhere near – ”
18594	18597	18598	18598	I	0	“ Hey . ”
18614	18623	18624	18624	Drew	72	“ Ooh , shit , was that her ? ”
18650	18653	18654	18654	I	0	“ No , ”
18660	18677	18657	18657	Drew	72	“ Fuck you . Put her on the phone . I need to talk to her . ”
18678	18683	18684	18684	I	0	“ Yeah , never , ”
18874	18879	18880	18880	Drew	72	“ You ignoring me ? ”
18887	18890	18880	18880	Drew	72	“ Iain ! ”
18898	18911	18880	18880	Drew	72	“ Iain , talk to this asshole . He ’s ignoring me . ”
19004	19014	19015	19015	she	66	“ Are you laughing ‘ cause I ’m short ? ”
19207	19228	19229	19229	Drew	72	“ Listen , dickhead . If you ’re bailing on tonight , I better hear by tomorrow that you closed , ”
19239	19270	19229	19229	Drew	72	“ Either shit or get off the pot , ‘ cause this is fucked up . You were supposed to be my wingman tonight . Everyone else here is couples . ”
19271	19276	19277	19277	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
19332	19346	19329	19329	her	66	“ Hey , so tell me . What ’s she wearing right now ? ”
19355	19364	19329	19329	her	66	“ She wearing a bra or is she – ”
19365	19373	19374	19374	I	0	“ Yeah , cool – have fun , ”
19431	19438	19439	19439	she	66	“ So you going out tonight ? ”
19480	19486	19487	19487	I	0	“ Nah . Staying in , ”
19496	19504	19487	19487	I	0	“ Wanna watch a movie with me ? ”
19511	19514	19515	19515	she	66	“ Oh , ”
19549	19552	19535	19535	She	66	“ Umm . ”
19561	19588	19535	19535	She	66	“ Sure . I think . I mean I do n’t know if I can commit to a whole movie but I can definitely start one . ”
19589	19592	19593	19593	I	0	“ Really ? ”
19611	19627	19599	19599	I	0	“ What kind of person goes into a movie knowing she ca n’t finish it ? ”
19628	19640	19641	19641	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Your roommate , I guess . ”
19727	19751	19752	19752	I	0	“ Well , if that ’s what you want to do then pick out a movie and I ’ll grab us some snacks , ”
19764	19780	19761	19761	Aly	66	“ Uh … you really want to give me the freedom to pick the movie ? ”
19781	19792	19793	19793	I	0	“ Why not ? We always watch the same stuff , ”
19834	19843	19844	19844	I	0	“ Damn . You watch girly stuff now ? ”
19858	19869	19870	19870	Aly	66	“ Oh yeah . Fuckin ’ love girly stuff now , ”
19884	19898	19899	19899	I	0	“ Rom - coms , reality shows – pretty much everything on Lifetime . ”
19902	19913	19899	19899	I	0	“ You used to hate that shit with a passion . ”
19914	19945	19946	19946	We	456	“ Well , now I love it with a passion . I mean I always did , I just did n’t let myself – never mind . It ’s starting . ”
20036	20044	20045	20045	Aly	66	“ Oh … kay . Well then . ”
20244	20255	20240	20240	he	463	“ Unh … ahh … oh , fuck … yeah . ”
20330	20340	20326	20326	she	66	“ I ’m gon na make a new tea . ”
20341	20346	20347	20347	She	66	“ Figured you might . ”
20353	20361	20347	20347	She	66	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
20362	20373	20374	20374	I	0	“ That you ’re awkward about watching a sex scene , ”
20377	20393	20374	20374	I	0	“ With me , at least . And that ’s fine . I get it . ”
20394	20404	20405	20405	she	66	“ Get what ? I ’m not being awkward , ”
20409	20418	20405	20405	she	66	“ I just wanted a glass of water . ”
20419	20432	20374	20374	I	0	“ You just said you were going to make a new tea . ”
20433	20441	20374	20374	I	0	“ Well , maybe I wanted both ! ”
20442	20460	20405	20405	she	66	“ Or maybe you ca n’t survive watching a girl getting her tits played with like that . ”
20470	20477	20478	20478	she	66	“ Why would that bother me ? ”
20490	20500	20501	20501	she	66	“ You know what , Emmett ? Screw it ! ”
20511	20527	20501	20501	she	66	“ You can wipe that smug look off your face , because I ’m watching . ”
20528	20535	20536	20536	I	0	“ Aly , it ’s fine , ”
20539	20552	20536	20536	I	0	“ We can fast - forward if you ca n’t handle it . ”
20553	20574	20575	20575	Aly	66	“ Ca n’t handle it ? I ’m an adult , Emmett , I assure you I can handle it , ”
21016	21026	21027	21027	Aly	66	“ Oh , that pup looks almost like Ozzy , ”
21039	21042	21043	21043	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
21156	21163	21146	21146	she	66	“ I should get to bed . ”
21164	21169	21170	21170	I	0	“ Sure . Night , ”
21173	21178	21146	21146	she	66	“ Goodnight , Emmett . ”
21222	21233	21237	21237	she	61	“ Wow . Someone ’s surprisingly eager to get out , ”
21246	21258	21237	21237	she	61	“ You finally getting excited to go home to that hottie ? ”
21259	21267	21268	21268	I	0	“ Uh , no . Not exactly . ”
21352	21368	21369	21369	she	61	“ So what ’s your plan of attack to get back in the friend zone ? ”
21387	21437	21369	21369	she	61	“ Honestly , I do n’t have one . I just figured hanging around him and having a conversation while acting completely normal would be good enough . I just want to prove to him that I ’m fine . That I ’m not like , actively wanting him . ”
21438	21464	21465	21465	Evie	61	“ Which you are . But – ooh ! You know what you should do ? Call him ‘ dude ’ as much as possible , ”
21483	21498	21499	21499	she	61	“ Mike has been calling me that these days and I fucking hate it , ”
21506	21565	21499	21499	she	61	“ It just makes me feel so … desexualized . Like he sees me as nothing more than a friend . ‘ Cause honestly , has anyone in the history of having sex been like , ‘ You have such beautiful breasts , dude , ’ or ‘ Mmm , dude , you feel amazing inside me ? ’ ”
21566	21573	21574	21574	I	0	“ Oh my God , Evie . ”
21660	21673	21674	21674	I	0	“ Alright . Calling him ‘ dude . ’ Definitely doing that , ”
21691	21698	21699	21699	I	0	“ Are you heading home now ? ”
21709	21716	21699	21699	I	0	“ Nope . Couple ’s therapy . ”
21717	21727	21728	21728	I	0	“ Oh . Right . Has that been helping ? ”
21732	21740	21741	21741	Evie	61	“ Totally . Like , so much , ”
21771	21776	21777	21777	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
21792	21806	21807	21807	she	61	“ And you wonder why I ’m dying for you to fuck Emmett , ”
21817	21833	21807	21807	she	61	“ My life outside this restaurant sucks . I need to live vicariously through somebody . ”
21834	21873	21807	21807	she	61	“ Well , if you want to live vicariously through me and Emmett being just friends , then by all means , because that ’s how things are staying all summer . And till the end of time . ”
21874	21879	21880	21880	Evie	61	“ Mm - hm , ”
22057	22060	22061	22061	he	56	“ Hey ! ”
22075	22081	22069	22069	I	0	“ That was … sketchy , ”
22151	22154	22137	22137	he	56	“ Dude . ”
22160	22166	22155	22155	I	0	“ What were you doing ? ”
22183	22190	22178	22178	Emmett	56	“ Nothing . Just work stuff . ”
22191	22197	22198	22198	I	0	“ What ’s work stuff ? ”
22212	22232	22198	22198	I	0	“ I still do n’t even know what you do for a living . What exactly is your job ? ”
22233	22242	22243	22243	Emmett	56	“ I just do stuff here and there , ”
22258	22272	22273	22273	I	0	“ Holy shit , Emmett . What do you do for a living ? ”
22276	22288	22273	22273	I	0	“ What are you – a hitman ? A male stripper ? ”
22294	22304	22289	22289	He	56	“ You think I could be a male stripper ? ”
22323	22339	22340	22340	Emmett	56	“ Long story short , I invest in whatever stocks or properties Julian invests in , ”
22354	22357	22340	22340	Emmett	56	“ Oh . ”
22363	22379	22340	22340	Emmett	56	“ Good move though . Julian ’s always been a genius , has n’t he ? ”
22380	22397	22344	22344	his	56	“ Pretty much . And now he owns the Empires . I ’m sure you heard . ”
22398	22413	22414	22414	I	0	“ Uh , yeah , my dad basically flipped out the day that happened , ”
22442	22462	22427	22427	he	1761	“ Emmett ’s older brother , and the same Julian you grew up going to Empires games with every Sunday ”
22467	22473	22427	22427	he	1761	“ the whole goddamned team . ”
22545	22557	22558	22558	Emmett	56	“ Yeah , I can probably imagine your dad ’s reaction , ”
22576	22590	22571	22571	he	56	“ What about you though ? How ’s your spin - off going ? ”
22591	22597	22568	22568	his	56	“ My spin - off ? ”
22598	22615	22616	22616	Emmett	56	“ Your restaurant . I figured you opened it to drive business back to the warehouse , ”
22624	22664	22619	22619	I	0	“ Yes . That ’s … exactly why I opened it , actually . Thank you for getting that . My parents were so upset that I did n’t just dunk all my money into sprucing up the warehouse . ”
22837	22852	22853	22853	Emmett	56	“ Yeah , I remember the warehouse doing … not so great for awhile , ”
22864	22878	22861	22861	his	56	“ I used to overhear my dad talking to yours on the phone . ”
22879	22899	22900	22900	I	0	“ It ’s okay . Everyone knew we were struggling . They were just merciful and pretended not to , ”
23032	23047	23048	23048	Emmett	56	“ So four years ago . That was when he finally bit the bullet ? ”
23051	23094	23048	23048	Emmett	56	“ Yeah , he knew he had to sell , but he hated knowing he ’d be selling to a competitor . He was like , ‘ They wo n’t keep the name and we ’ll just get wiped from history , ’ ”
23102	23106	23095	23095	I	0	“ So dramatic . ”
23107	23122	23189	23189	his	56	“ Well , that company was his pride and joy . Even I remember . ”
23123	23166	23189	23189	his	56	“ Yeah . His pride , his joy – the bane of his whole existence . I mean I did get it . I knew it hurt most because he wanted to make my grandpa proud and keep our family name alive . ”
23167	23178	23179	23179	Emmett	56	“ So you bought the company to keep it going , ”
23192	23195	23179	23179	Emmett	56	“ Yep . ”
23216	23280	23204	23204	I	0	“ I already had savings and I spent the next year busting my ass , working nonstop and living as frugally as possible so I could scrounge up the money to buy the company from Dad . But it was n’t just buying the company I had to think about . I knew I needed something to revive the actual business , too . ”
23281	23290	23291	23291	Emmett	56	“ And that was the restaurant , right ? ”
23294	23298	23299	23299	I	0	“ Sure was , ”
23455	23460	23445	23445	my	0	“ cool and relevant . ”
23479	23499	23500	23500	Emmett	56	“ That ’s fucking nuts , Aly . Basically , you saved the shit out of your family business , ”
23527	23548	23514	23514	he	56	“ So , do you ever plan on having a location that ’s open for more than just the summer ? ”
23549	23589	23590	23590	I	0	“ I ’d love to . And I ’ve thought about it a lot , but it would only make sense to do that in the city , and I just do n’t have the money for that yet , ”
23593	23606	23590	23590	I	0	“ And for now , I should concentrate on this first location . ”
23607	23630	23631	23631	Emmett	56	“ I got ta be honest , I looked it up the other day and you ’ve got fuckin ’ killer reviews , ”
23641	23662	23631	23631	Emmett	56	“ I mean your dad has to be … I do n’t know . Crazy happy ? Over the moon ? ”
23667	23678	23679	23679	I	0	“ Oh God , my dad is … embarrassingly proud , ”
23709	23712	23713	23713	I	0	“ Oh , ”

23809	23825	23826	23826	I	0	“ Dude . Why did you tell your mom you ’d be gone all summer ? ”
23834	23849	23826	23826	I	0	“ Because she was trying to set me up with her friends ’ daughters . ”
23850	23863	23864	23864	I	0	“ What , are they not pretty enough for your astronomical standards ? ”
23867	23872	23873	23873	Emmett	56	“ They ’re pretty , ”
23884	23916	23873	23873	Emmett	56	“ But if my mom ’s introducing me to someone , she ’s suggesting I start a relationship with her , and like I said , I do n’t do those . ”
23917	23930	23931	23931	I	0	“ Have you literally never been in a relationship since high school ? ”
23934	23944	23945	23945	Emmett	56	“ No , I was in one during college , ”
23958	23968	23945	23945	Emmett	56	“ And … it just was n’t any good ? ”
23969	23974	23954	23954	I	0	“ It was great . ”
23975	23984	23985	23985	I	0	“ What ? Then why did it end ? ”
24106	24117	24118	24118	he	56	“ I just did n’t have the time for it , ”
24129	24134	24135	24135	he	56	“ Any more questions ? ”
24145	24148	24149	24149	I	0	“ No , ”

24262	24275	24253	24253	he	56	“ I know we won , but I did n’t catch highlights . ”
24276	24286	24287	24287	I	0	“ Well , apparently we went into extra innings , ”
24291	24303	24287	24287	I	0	“ Jennings hit the walk - off homer in the twelfth . ”
24304	24307	24308	24308	Emmett	56	“ Yeah ? ”
24320	24326	24308	24308	Emmett	56	“ Pull up the video . ”

24375	24378	24359	24359	Emmett	56	“ Right ? ”
24379	24395	24396	24396	Emmett	56	“ Jennings had to be our best pick - up this past off - season , ”
24399	24411	24396	24396	Emmett	56	“ Well , you can thank your owner brother for that , ”
24472	24481	24468	24468	I	0	“ I wish we saw that game live . ”
24482	24493	24468	24468	I	0	“ What , you did n’t enjoy our movie night ? ”
24519	24527	24528	24528	I	0	“ Dude . That movie kinda sucked , ”
24540	24545	24546	24546	he	56	“ Yeah , dude , ”
24550	24555	24546	24546	he	56	“ It totally did . ”
24591	24593	24584	24584	I	0	“ dude ”

24706	24719	24720	24720	Emmett	56	“ What , do you want me to come to your room ? ”

24764	24767	24744	24744	I	0	“ Goodnight . ”

24885	24888	24879	24879	I	0	“ Omigod ! ”
25094	25097	25089	25089	Emmett	56	“ Stop . ”
25105	25110	25111	25111	I	0	“ W - what ? ”
25121	25137	25114	25114	his	56	“ Stop staring at my dick like you want to put it in your mouth . ”
25216	25219	25220	25220	He	56	“ Aly . ”
25233	25241	25242	25242	he	56	“ Why are you just standing there ? ”
25300	25308	25309	25309	he	56	“ Do you want to touch it ? ”
25333	25344	25345	25345	he	56	“ Because unless that ’s what you want , Aly , ”
25349	25361	25345	25345	he	56	“ you better fucking turn around and go to your room . ”
25375	25380	25345	25345	he	56	“ go to your room ”
25629	25647	25652	25652	his	56	“ Unless you want this right now you better fucking turn around and go to your room . ”
25733	25736	25737	25737	Evie	61	“ Okay . ”
25767	25807	25808	25808	I	0	“ You do look miserable enough that I ’m going to spare you of like , eighty percent of the filthy questions I want to ask right now , because I know you do n’t want to hear it . ”
25818	25834	25835	25835	she	61	“ So , here ’s the deal . You have two options here , okay ? ”
25844	25893	25835	25835	she	61	“ One – you stop getting in your head and just fuck Emmett already . You know you want to , he knows you want to , so just leave the past in the past and let the man make it up to you in orgasms . Right ? ”
25897	25960	25835	25835	she	61	“ Wrong . Even if I were able to miraculously forget the past and sleep with him , we ’d still have to consider that it could get awkward or complicated between us , which could result in me having to move out , which we are still very much trying to avoid because how are you and Mike by the way ? ”
25961	25994	25995	25995	Evie	61	“ We fooled around last night but when I touched his dick , he put my hand back in my lap . At which point my soul died and we started fighting , ”
26007	26027	26028	26028	she	61	“ So yeah , point taken . No fucking Emmett and no sex for either of us . Yippee , ”
26039	26072	26028	26028	she	61	“ Wait . What the hell am I talking about ? Just because you ca n’t fuck Emmett does n’t mean you ca n’t fuck any of the other babes in town ! ”
26073	26083	26084	26084	I	0	“ Yeah , but we ’ve been over this , ”
26087	26120	26084	26084	I	0	“ I ’m not hitting the club again , I do n’t trust Tinder and I ’m not going to date any of our ‘ cute regulars ’ because that looks unprofessional . ”
26121	26140	26141	26141	Evie	61	“ So what , we just have to pray that some miracle hottie just lands in your lap ? ”
26157	26161	26150	26153	one of our waitresses	559	“ Holy shit ! ”
26165	26172	26162	26162	Evie	61	“ Hannah ! What ’s up ? ”
26185	26190	26191	26191	Hannah	93	“ I ’m sorry , ”
26204	26219	26198	26198	she	93	“ I just – there ’s a guy outside asking for you , Aly . ”
26224	26227	26198	26198	she	93	“ Who ? ”
26228	26261	26198	26198	she	93	“ I do n’t know his name . I just know that he ’s really hot and a bunch of paparazzi followed him here . They ’re taking pictures through the window . ”
26262	26265	26269	26269	Evie	61	“ What ? ”
26411	26416	26417	26417	he	562	“ Aly , right ? ”
26420	26433	26417	26417	he	562	“ It ’s nice to meet you . I ’m Drew Maddox . ”
26682	26685	26686	26686	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
26777	26782	26783	26783	I	0	“ Ah , Christ … ”
27149	27152	27142	27142	his	72	“ Emmett . ”
27166	27175	27159	27159	he	72	“ Is this a fucking joke , Maddox ? ”
27176	27216	27159	27159	he	72	“ No , this is me being petty because you missed the party I threw for Iain . Also , I tried the lobster roll at Ellie ’s restaurant – it ’s fucking amazing . Have you had it ? ”
27217	27247	27159	27159	he	72	“ Her name is Aly , jackass , and you do realize I ’ll fucking kill you if you lay so much as a finger on her , right ? ”
27248	27269	27159	27159	he	72	“ Well , I value my life so I ’ll just have tantric sex with her . How about that ? ”
27270	27273	27159	27159	he	72	“ Drew – ”
27274	27294	27159	27159	he	72	“ You should n’t have waited so long to make a move , Emmett . You snooze you lose . ”
27340	27349	27319	27319	I	0	“ Emmett ! What the hell are you – ”
27350	27359	27360	27360	I	0	“ Where did you even meet Drew today ? ”
27363	27371	27360	27360	I	0	“ Did he come into the restaurant ? ”
27392	27400	27386	27386	she	61	“ Why does it matter , Emmett ? ”
27415	27431	27401	27401	Her	61	“ You and I have an agreement , remember ? We ’re supposed to be – ”
27432	27440	27441	27441	I	0	“ Friends . Yeah . I know , ”
27454	27472	27445	27445	I	0	“ But for friends , we ’ve definitely seen each other naked way too many fucking times . ”
27473	27478	27479	27479	Aly	61	“ Emmett , please , ”
27504	27531	27491	27491	she	61	“ You know I ca n’t do this with you . You said that if I lived here , we ’d be platonic – you promised . ”
27532	27546	27491	27491	she	61	“ What ’s platonic about you staring last night instead of walking away ? ”
27547	27563	27491	27491	she	61	“ What ’s normal about changing with the door open when you have a roommate ? ”
27564	27591	27491	27491	she	61	“ I ’ve lived alone my whole fucking adult life , Aly , sorry I have n’t changed every one of my habits for you yet . ”
27592	27601	27602	27602	she	572	“ You ’re being an asshole right now , ”
27605	27612	27602	27602	she	572	“ And you ’re in denial , ”
27616	27658	27613	27613	I	0	“ You want me just as badly as I want you . You ’re only going on a date with Drew to get me out of your head . I ’ve seen girls do it before and you ’re no different . ”
27659	27679	27728	27728	her	573	“ Emmett , please do n’t talk like you know anything about me anymore , because you do n’t ! ”
27680	27722	27723	27723	I	0	“ No shit , Aly , that ’s why it ’s fucking killing me that you ’re about to spend a night talking to Drew and telling him everything I ’ve been dying to know about you for twelve fucking years , ”
27756	27817	27746	27746	she	573	“ I want to know where you ’ve been , what you ’ve done – I want to know everything I can about you , Aly , because all I know right now is the fact that you wo n’t let yourself be with me despite the fact that you want me , and it ’s driving me fucking insane ! ”
27818	27827	27828	27828	Aly	61	“ What if I do n’t want you ? ”
27832	27838	27839	27839	I	0	“ I know you do , ”
27843	27872	27873	27873	I	0	“ Aside from the fact that I saw it last night , I saw it the night at the club . Did you already forget what happened then ? ”
27887	27979	27980	27980	I	0	“ Because if you did let me remind you that you looked at me like you wanted me to fuck you right in that bathroom . You came home with me , you straddled me and you begged me for more of everything I did to that perfect fucking body of yours , so if you want to tell me that you do n’t want me , then at least explain that night to me . Because I do n’t think I ’d ever felt a wetter pussy in my life , ”
28041	28044	28045	28045	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
28233	28242	28265	28265	Emmett	56	“ Are you fucking kidding me , Aly ? ”

28270	28281	28282	28282	he	56	“ Are you trying to fuck with me right now ? ”
28299	28321	28282	28282	he	56	“ Do you want me to punish you for staring at my cock last night ? Is that what you want ? ”
28322	28325	28285	28285	his	56	“ No ! ”
28326	28335	28336	28336	He	56	“ Then why were you watching that video ? ”
28344	28362	28363	28363	he	56	“ Why were you watching fucking roommate porn if you do n’t want me to fuck you ? ”
28366	28370	28363	28363	he	56	“ Tell me . ”
28455	28463	28464	28464	Emmett	56	“ Just admit that you want me , ”
28483	28490	28475	28475	he	56	“ I do n’t , Emmett ! ”
28502	28511	28491	28491	I	0	“ So just get out of my room ! ”
28512	28522	28523	28523	he	56	“ Why ? So you can touch your pussy ? ”
28538	28562	28534	28534	he	56	“ So you can make yourself come while I jack off down the hall ? Is that what you want to do again ? ”
28619	28623	28624	28624	I	0	“ Fuck you , ”
28760	28766	28767	28767	I	0	“ Kiss me somewhere else , ”

29107	29115	29116	29116	He	56	“ Tell me how good it feels . ”
29126	29131	29132	29132	I	0	“ It feels good , ”
29147	29162	29132	29132	I	0	“ Dammit , Emmett , do n’t stop – it feels so fucking good . ”
29163	29177	29132	29132	I	0	“ Tell me what you thought about when you touched yourself last night . ”

31564	31592	31593	31593	I	0	“ Are you really trying to dare me into staying , Emmett ? Because I ’m not thirteen anymore , and it ’s not going to work , ”

31957	31982	31983	31983	I	0	“ If you really need to know , Emmett , it ’s because I woke up this morning and felt like shit about myself , ”

Every time I think long enough about you , I feel angry . I feel embarrassed and stupid and lonely , so even if I did want you , in what world would it make sense for me to be with you ? ”

I ’m not the one who ruined everything . You just want it to be me . ”

32274	32302	32303	32303	Emmett	56	“ No , you wo n’t talk about this – now or ever , because you do n’t like thinking about how I ’m just your scapegoat , ”
32310	32334	32303	32303	Emmett	56	“ You do n’t like thinking about how it ’s easier to blame me and let the real asshole off scot - free . ”
32388	32433	32434	32434	Emmett	56	“ You lied to yourself all these years , Aly , and I let you because I knew you were hurting . I figured I might as well let you believe what you wanted , because I was never going to see you again , ”
32438	32481	32482	32482	he	56	“ But now that you ’re here , I can say it – I ’m not the one who made your life miserable . It was n’t me , and fuck it , I ’m done letting you pretend that it was , ”
32581	32586	32587	32587	I	0	“ Evie … no , ”
32611	32618	32591	32591	she	638	“ Seriously . I ca n’t . ”
32619	32624	32625	32625	she	638	“ Except you can , ”
32632	32637	32638	32638	she	638	“ And you will , ”
32704	32725	32699	32699	Louboutins	96	“ I mean you have to look good , Aly . You ’re going on a date with Jude Maddox . ”
32726	32730	32671	32671	They	640	“ Drew Maddox . ”
32731	32759	32760	32760	Evie	61	“ Whatever . If he ’s the type to draw paparazzi , you need to be camera ready , and nothing says camera ready like red soles , ”
32773	32783	32764	32764	Mike	62	“ Evie ! Are we out of frozen pizzas ? ”
32784	32787	32792	32792	Mike	62	“ Yes ! ”
32797	32810	32792	32792	Mike	62	“ Dude . What am I supposed to eat for dinner then ? ”
32832	32875	32876	32876	Evie	61	“ Please refrain from dude - ing me , Michael – I sent you a text that said ‘ remember frozen pizzas ’ when you were at the grocery store ! So do n’t talk to me about your dinner – okay ? ”
32892	32895	32896	32896	she	61	“ See ? ”
32901	32965	32896	32896	she	61	“ If you had any doubts about why you need to go out tonight , it ’s because one day you might spend your Friday arguing with your fiancé about frozen pizzas . So before that happens , you better have all the fun in the world , and that starts with you looking happy that you ’ve got this severely hot date . ”
32966	32973	32898	32898	her	61	“ I know . I just … ”
33190	33202	33203	33203	Evie	61	“ Aly ? You said you wanted this dress , right ? ”
33343	33348	33352	33352	Evie	61	“ Oh , no ! ”
33365	33374	33375	33375	she	61	“ Shit , Drew says he ’s outside ! ”
33383	33392	33375	33375	she	61	“ Hurry , hurry ! Put that on ! ”
33466	33486	33487	33487	he	72	“ Yeah , I do n’t know how you girls walk in those , but I ’m not complaining , ”
33601	33611	33612	33612	I	0	“ I take it you come here a lot ? ”
33655	33669	33670	33670	he	72	“ Yeah , we ’ve been coming here pretty much twice a week , ”

34100	34103	34094	34094	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
34104	34115	34116	34116	he	72	“ Should ’ve figured . The whole crew ’s here , ”
34234	34241	34242	34242	Drew	72	“ Shall we go say hi ? ”
34245	34248	34249	34249	I	0	“ Okay , ”
34324	34329	34330	34330	Britt	84	“ Drewsie - poo ! ”
34336	34343	34344	34344	Drew	72	“ Christ , that nickname sucks , ”
34436	34441	34442	34442	Drew	72	“ Hey , asshole , ”
34485	34490	34491	34491	Emmett	56	“ What ’s up , ”
34504	34512	34513	34513	She	84	“ Whoa . Wait . Seafood Girl ? ”
34521	34545	34513	34513	She	84	“ I did n’t even realize it was you ! Omigod ! Who would ’ve guessed that you could clean up so well ? ”
34554	34561	34546	34546	Drew	72	“ Thanks . I ’m sure . ”
34562	34572	34573	34573	Britt	84	“ Oh , it ’s a compliment ! Duh , ”
34592	34629	34582	34582	she	84	“ So funny that you ’re here because E and I were just saying how we ’re the only two who have n’t eaten yet . So if you ’ve got extra room at your table … ”
34643	34659	34630	34630	She	84	“ Wink , wink . Hint , hint . What do you say , Drewy ? ”
34660	34668	34669	34669	My	0	“ I ’m sure that ’s fine . ”
34707	34710	34711	34711	Drew	72	“ Yeah ? ”

34774	34785	34786	34786	she	84	“ Yay , yay ! Double date ! Double date ! ”
34931	34940	34941	34941	he	56	“ Shall we ? The hostess is waiting , ”
34999	35013	34995	34995	her	84	“ Why , dirty boy ? So you can stare at my ass ? ”
35414	35420	35421	35421	Drew	72	“ Whoa . You alright ? ”
35436	35443	35427	35427	his	72	“ Christ . You ’re jiggling . ”
35466	35480	35463	35463	Drew	72	“ I was talking about your knee , but yeah . That too . ”
35481	35484	35485	35485	I	0	“ Oh . ”
35498	35505	35506	35506	I	0	“ Sorry . About the fidgeting , ”
35546	35552	35553	35553	he	72	“ You got ta stop , ”
35667	35678	35679	35679	she	84	“ Excuse me , I do believe I was talking , ”
35725	35737	35738	35738	she	84	“ Babe . You ’re gon na wanna hear this part , ”
35742	35770	35771	35771	she	84	“ It ’s the part where I got a little too drunk after the mezcal tour and skinny dipped in the pool – in front of everyone , ”
35794	35804	35805	35805	he	72	“ Hey . So I need to confess something , ”
35868	35880	35881	35881	Drew	72	“ I ’m kind of only here to be a dick , ”
35891	35894	35895	35895	He	72	“ What ? ”
35927	35954	35920	35920	his	72	“ Yeah , so I ’m pretty sure you know this since you two have been eye - banging all night , but Emmett wants you . ”
35968	35973	35963	35963	he	72	“ Like … bad . ”
35977	35988	35974	35974	I	0	“ I , um … yes . I do know . ”
36008	36025	36026	36026	I	0	“ So , you ’re here because what ? You just want to fuck with him ? ”
36036	36050	36051	36051	he	72	“ Yeah . That ’s pretty much what we do to each other , ”
36054	36059	36060	36060	he	72	“ Though , actually , ”
36064	36094	36095	36095	he	72	“ I am here to enjoy the fact that you ’re my date , ‘ cause you do look beautiful and that dress is … pretty fuckin ’ killer , ”
36122	36188	36117	36117	he	72	“ But that said , I ’m not actually trying to take you home tonight . Unless Emmett magically loses interest in you , which … I assure you he wo n’t … I ’m just here to torture him as payback for some petty shit . That make any sense or did I drink too much ? ‘ Cause I just drank a lot . ”
36201	36219	36220	36220	I	0	“ Um … I think that makes some sense . Why are you drinking so fast though ? ”
36223	36239	36240	36240	he	72	“ ’Cause that ’s what it takes to survive a night with this Beth chick , ”
36248	36263	36240	36240	he	72	“ So bottoms up . ‘ Cause she ’s still going on about Oaxaca . ”
36285	36317	36318	36318	Britt	84	“ Oh my God , it was amazing . Actually , I still have some distributor contacts in case you ’re interested in carrying their mezcal at your restaurant , Aly , ”
36324	36327	36318	36318	Britt	84	“ Oh . ”
36342	36377	36378	36378	I	0	“ Well , that ’s really kind of you but I feel like most of the booze people seem to want at the restaurant is wine , beer and Bloody Marys on the weekend , ”
36392	36399	36400	36400	I	0	“ But hey , who knows , ”
36403	36431	36400	36400	I	0	“ Maybe I ’ll order some for my dad . He loves mezcal . I should definitely have at least a bottle for the day he visits . ”
36443	36461	36438	36438	she	84	“ You ’ve been open for more than three months and your dad has n’t visited yet ? ”
36467	36482	36462	36462	Her	84	“ Is n’t opening your first restaurant kind of a big deal for you ? ”
36483	36486	36487	36487	I	0	“ Oh . ”
36502	36511	36487	36487	I	0	“ Yes . It is a big deal . ”
36512	36520	36462	36462	Her	84	“ Does your dad live far away ? ”
36521	36527	36528	36528	I	0	“ I ’d say so , ”
36568	36576	36559	36559	my	0	“ What state does he live in ? ”
36577	36611	36462	36462	Her	84	“ Oh , he ’s … not out of state . He lives in New York . In Brooklyn . But you know , it ’s more than a two hour drive away . ”
36612	36642	36643	36643	Britt	84	“ Pshhh , that ’s nothing when it comes to visiting your own daughter ! Especially when she ’s at like , a huge turning point in her life , ”
36646	36679	36643	36643	Britt	84	“ But maybe that ’s just me ? I ’m just like , so close to my dad . I ca n’t even imagine him not wanting to visit me if I – ”
36680	36683	36684	36684	Emmett	56	“ Hey . ”
36698	36715	36716	36716	he	56	“ Why do n’t you stop talking about that ? Recommend me another drink or something , ”
36722	36728	36716	36716	he	56	“ Ooh ! You bet ! ”
36760	36781	36747	36747	she	84	“ I ’m really sorry about your dad , Aly . It sucks that he just refuses to see you . ”
36937	36939	36916	36916	he	1761	“ sorry ”
36985	36992	36993	36993	Drew	72	“ What the hell was that ? ”
37012	37015	37016	37016	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
37060	37073	37074	37074	I	0	“ It was just … a low blow to piss me off , ”
37094	37107	37081	37081	Drew	72	“ Well , why do n’t we piss her off right back ? ”
37119	37125	37081	37081	Drew	72	“ What do you suggest ? ”
37126	37135	37136	37136	Drew	72	“ Something that requires pissing off Emmett too , ”
37139	37143	37136	37136	Drew	72	“ That okay ? ”
37152	37160	37149	37149	I	0	“ Do what you got ta do . ”
37225	37228	37211	37211	Drew	72	“ Drew . ”
37243	37253	37254	37254	he	72	“ Let me talk to you for a second , ”
37280	37289	37277	37277	he	72	“ Nah , bro , I ’m good , ”
37311	37315	37297	37297	He	72	“ He pissed ? ”
37316	37321	37322	37322	I	0	“ I think so , ”
37327	37333	37322	37322	I	0	“ How ‘ bout her ? ”
37334	37342	37299	37299	his	72	“ I – I do n’t know . ”
37343	37351	37352	37352	Drew	72	“ All good . I got this , ”
37372	37381	37382	37382	he	72	“ I get any salt on my lips ? ”
37452	37458	37459	37459	She	84	“ Get out . Please . ”
37483	37492	37493	37493	he	72	“ Whoa , hey – what ’s this ? ”
37585	37590	37591	37591	he	56	“ Meet me outside , ”
37601	37608	37591	37591	he	56	“ I ’m taking you home . ”
37641	37643	37680	37680	Emmett	56	“ met ”
37774	37788	37789	37789	I	0	“ Bet you did n’t know that he had n’t visited me yet , ”
37830	37837	37838	37838	I	0	“ Pretty embarrassing to think about , ”
37847	37873	37874	37874	I	0	“ I did n’t want to make him the enemy because that would mean I ’d spent my life trying to please the bad guy , ”
37903	37943	37944	37944	I	0	“ I mean every decision I ’ve ever made – chopping my hair , rejecting girly stuff , copying everything you did for as long as I could – it was all in the hopes of winning his approval , ”
37964	37975	37944	37944	I	0	“ And God , I just hate to think it . ”
37990	38054	37983	37983	I	0	“ I hate to think that for the past four years , I ’ve busted my ass and dedicated my whole life to saving this company for nothing . Because I ’m pretty sure I only did it for a last shot at his approval . Just for the fighting chance that he might finally like me as much as he likes you . ”
38147	38162	38134	38134	Emmett	56	“ I was never comfortable with it , Aly . None of us were . ”
38173	38196	38197	38197	Emmett	56	“ We all saw the way he treated you , and trust me , we hated it . Me and Mom especially , ”
38200	38294	38197	38197	Emmett	56	“ I hated that he came to my games instead of your plays . I hated the way he just lost interest in a conversation when you started talking . It was so fucked up and awkward . I mean as a kid , I ’m pretty sure I thought it was funny . But by the time I was in high school , I remember thinking it was weird that your dad was so obsessed with hearing about my teammates or whoever I was dating or anything going on in my life . ”
38317	38424	38311	38311	I	0	“ I knew something was screwed up , Aly . But our dads – they grew up together , and my dad could only see yours through rose - colored glasses . And I was a stupid , lazy kid so I just tried to ignore it . I did n’t bother myself with how you were probably hurting . It was too much trouble for me . The one time I talked to my dad about yours , he got pissed at me for being disrespectful , and I hated when he was mad at me . I did n’t know how to handle it . ”
38425	38462	38463	38463	I	0	“ Because you were n’t used to it . You were his favorite . You were everyone ’s favorite . You had no idea what it was like to be born into another person ’s shadow , ”
38480	38592	38472	38472	I	0	“ I never had a chance to be someone who mattered . Even in school with my closest friends , I felt like no one liked me for me . People only hung out with me to hear about you – what our vacations were like together , what you were like outside of school . When I went up to adults , they looked tired of me before I even started talking . They were just anticipating me complaining about something you did , some prank you pulled on me , and it annoyed them to have to discipline you . Because everyone loved you most . My dad included . ”
38636	38655	38656	38656	he	56	“ I did n’t know . I had no idea it was this bad for you , Aly , ”
38663	38699	38656	38656	he	56	“ Everything was just a joke to me then . I did n’t know what pain felt like . I could n’t empathize . I was a fucking idiot , and I ’m so sorry . ”
38735	38751	38752	38752	I	0	“ I hated that you gave him the excuse to finally get rid of me , ”
38798	38868	38881	38881	his	56	“ What you did that day … when you ratted me out . Somewhere in the back of my head , I knew you were right , but I convinced myself you only did it to torture me like you always did . You took away half my friends by hooking up with them – I figured you were just trying to take away another thing that I loved . ”
38869	38876	38877	38877	Emmett	56	“ You did n’t love Scott , ”
38927	38945	38946	38946	I	0	“ Of course I did n’t love him , Emmett . I was just lonely . Constantly , ”
38963	39019	38946	38946	I	0	“ I did n’t have real friends . I did n’t have a dad who wanted to even look in my direction . My mom was constantly defending him . Mr. Scott was just … my first time experiencing someone who was interested in me . Someone who was actually interested in listening to me . ”
39043	39050	39039	39039	I	0	“ did n’t understand our bond . ”
39298	39303	39293	39294	Mr. Scott	103	“ easing into things . ”
39304	39322	39323	39323	Emmett	56	“ He was thirty - five years old and he had his fucking hand between your legs , ”
39332	39370	39323	39323	Emmett	56	“ He was a fucking predator and I still fantasize about beating the fucking shit out of him . Maybe I should have done it differently , but I ’ll never regret what I did that day . ”
39618	39650	39651	39651	he	60	“ You ’re going to stay with Aunt Carla for the summer . I ’ve got too much to worry about to handle you when you ’re this out of control , ”
40106	40112	40113	40113	I	0	“ He ’s not proud , ”
40123	40146	40116	40116	Emmett	56	“ He ’s just embarrassed that his daughter did what he could n’t . And I think he hates me for it . ”
40147	40154	40155	40155	Emmett	56	“ He does n’t hate you , ”
40167	40173	40174	40174	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
40184	40201	40174	40174	I	0	“ He definitely does n’t love me . I do n’t know if he ever did . ”
40202	40208	40209	40209	Emmett	56	“ Well , I do , ”
40229	40239	40240	40240	he	56	“ Loving you is the oldest memory I have , ”
40251	40312	40313	40313	he	56	“ You were a part of my life for as long as I can remember . All my best memories were with you . I know I messed with you a lot , but in the end , I always loved you , and I do n’t think I really knew it till that day I found you after school , ”
40326	40377	40313	40313	he	56	“ And trust me , I ’ll never regret what I did that day , but I ’ll always regret the fact that I lost you after . I missed you so fucking much , Aly . I had no idea what you meant to me until you were gone . ”
40424	40435	40436	40436	I	0	“ Well , you ’ve got twelve years on me , ”
40441	40459	40436	40436	I	0	“ Because I do n’t think I knew what you meant to me until I came back . ”
40487	40495	40496	40496	he	56	“ Hey , I ’ll take it , ”
40508	40518	40496	40496	he	56	“ As long as we both know it now . ”
40932	40935	40925	40925	Emmett	56	“ Hey . ”
40979	40984	40985	40985	he	56	“ You ’re awake , ”

41117	41121	41109	41109	He	56	“ My boxers ? ”
41122	41127	41134	41134	he	56	“ Mm - hm . ”
41143	41147	41134	41134	he	56	“ You first . ”
41175	41181	41182	41182	he	56	“ Show me your pussy , ”

42515	42518	42519	42519	Aly	58	“ More , ”
42577	42584	42585	42585	I	0	“ Tell me how that feels , ”
42600	42608	42585	42585	I	0	“ Does that feel good , baby ? ”

43387	43442	43375	43375	she	57	“ You know , I ’ll give you some credit for texting me to let me know that you are in New York this summer , but at some point , I ’d expect you to call and explain why you lied about being away . To your own mother . Who loves you . ”
43467	43507	43443	43443	I	0	“ I do n’t know , Ma . I think it might ’ve been the two - page list of friends ’ daughters that you emailed me . Got ta say , that was a bit of a buzzkill . ”
43508	43551	43605	43605	Mom	57	“ I was n’t telling you to show all of them around , I just thought you ’d pick one or two to meet if the dates of their visits matched up with your availability . What ’s so hard about that ? ”
43552	43562	43563	43563	I	0	“ Nothing . Everything . I do n’t know . ”
43578	43604	43571	43571	I	0	“ The real question is why you even believed that I ’d be gone that long . I ’ve never just upped and done that . ”
43612	43638	43605	43605	Mom	57	“ I do n’t know , Emmett . I just assumed that maybe you ’d finally gotten tired of everything and just … run off . ”
43650	43674	43647	43647	her	57	“ Honestly , a part of me hoped that you were really leaving for that long , because Lord knows you deserve it . ”
43675	43678	43647	43647	her	57	“ Stop . ”
43679	43727	43647	43647	her	57	“ I do mean it though , Emmett . As your mother , it would make me happy if I knew you could spend even a few weeks away . Just so you can get a breather . You could go to a resort or maybe some – ”
43728	43731	43732	43732	I	0	“ Ma , ”
43735	43739	43732	43732	I	0	“ New subject . ”

43817	43820	43808	43808	she	57	“ cool off ”
43888	43898	43899	43899	I	0	“ She and I are getting along just fine , ”
43910	43957	43899	43899	I	0	“ I feel bad that I promised her the house to herself and now you two are spending the summer under the same roof . Especially since you had that little falling out . I know it ’s never quite been the same between you since . ”

44180	44201	44202	44202	Mom	57	“ Well , if your roommate situation is peachy , that ’s one less thing for me to worry about , ”
44205	44236	44202	44202	Mom	57	“ Anyway , now that I know you are not in the Maldives , will you be making it to the game this Sunday ? Gram misses you and Ozzy . ”
44237	44241	44242	44242	I	0	“ Of course , ”
44321	44324	44325	44325	Mom	57	“ Perfect , ”
44328	44350	44325	44325	Mom	57	“ And feel free to bring Aly . I do n’t think she ’s watched the game from our suite yet . ”
44351	44369	44370	44370	I	0	“ Sounds good . But I thought I was n’t allowed to bring girls to Sunday games , ”
44373	44396	44397	44397	Mom	57	“ Well , Sunday is a family day , so no bringing girls unless they ’re serious girlfriends . You know that , ”
44400	44431	44397	44397	Mom	57	“ But Aly is different . I know she ’ll never be your girlfriend – Lord , I wish – but she ’ll always be a part of the family . ”
44522	44537	44497	44497	She	57	“ Anyway , Ma , I got ta go . Someone ’s calling me . ”
44538	44542	44543	44543	I	0	“ A girl ? ”

44563	44568	44569	44569	Mom	57	“ Oh . Her , ”
44573	44593	44569	44569	Mom	57	“ That reminds me , you do need a date for the gala next week . Not her though . ”
44594	44597	44598	44598	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
44602	44637	44598	44598	I	0	“ I mean it , Emmett . You ’re hosting it , so you can not show up solo . Not unless you want me and all my friends pushing their daughters on you . ”
44638	44643	44644	44644	I	0	“ Alright , Mom , ”
44668	44675	44676	44676	I	0	“ I have to go though , ”
44695	44717	44690	44690	I	0	“ Shit . I just realized I ’m supposed to have a meeting with Britt about the gala today . Fuck . ”

45149	45152	45138	45138	I	0	“ Shit . ”
45442	45457	45458	45458	Evie	61	“ I ’d exchange assignments with you , but you know the answers better , ”
45523	45573	45574	45574	she	61	“ Also , you do n’t deserve to have the best sex of your life and get all your work done for you the next morning . That ’s entirely too much good fortune in a short period of time , and we do n’t want to spoil you , ”
45589	45625	45574	45574	she	61	“ Seriously though , can you give me the details of how he made you come with just the head of his dick ? I need to know the logistics of that . For science . ”
45626	45658	45659	45659	I	0	“ First off , no . Second , can you not talk about his dick so loudly in front of our staff ? I think that might be blatant sexual harassment , ”
45704	45711	45712	45712	Evie	61	“ Okay , I ’ll whisper , ”
45715	45734	45712	45712	Evie	61	“ So , like , was he using his dick like a vibrator against your clit , or – ”
45735	45738	45739	45739	I	0	“ Evie ! ”
45742	45750	45739	45739	I	0	“ How was your night last night ? ”
45755	45778	45779	45779	Evie	61	“ Oof . Talk about a boner - killer . Well , as you know , we were out of frozen pizzas , ”
45788	45862	45863	45863	Evie	61	“ But we did agree on something the therapist emailed us . He said something about how Mike and I need to hang out together with each other ’s friends , because watching your significant other interact with other people is supposed to remind you of what you love about them or whatever . So whenever you and Emmett are ready , I ’ve got a double date with your names on it , ”
45871	45884	45868	45868	she	61	“ Unless you ’re still recovering from last night ’s double date . ”
45885	45893	45863	45863	Evie	61	“ It was definitely … a doozy . ”
45894	45914	45915	45915	Evie	61	“ Yeah , I ’d think so , because it ’s got you using the word ‘ doozy , ’ ”
45918	45937	45915	45915	Evie	61	“ I want to thoroughly make fun of you for that but I ’ll give you a break . ”
45938	45945	45946	45946	I	0	“ How weirdly merciful of you , ”
45949	45966	45946	45946	I	0	“ Well . I figure you ’re gon na need it considering who just walked in . ”
46052	46059	46060	46060	Evie	61	“ You ’re safe for now , ”
46066	46075	46060	46060	Evie	61	“ Though I can feel her cattiness brewing . ”
46145	46151	46152	46152	she	84	“ Good morning , ladies , ”
46241	46251	46252	46252	Evie	61	“ Morning , Britt . Hitting the club soon ? ”
46276	46307	46263	46263	Britt	84	“ Oh , this thing ? No , no club for me , doll . I ’m actually going to have a meeting with Emmett here in about twenty minutes . ”
46370	46378	46379	46379	Britt	84	“ It ’s for Emmett ’s gala , ”
46387	46393	46379	46379	Britt	84	“ Ooh . What gala ? ”
46417	46427	46428	46428	she	84	“ Why , Aly , that sounds very fancy , ”
46438	46480	46481	46481	she	84	“ Oh , you ’re so cute ! Yes , I guess you could call it ‘ fancy . ’ It is black tie , so you ’ll definitely have to save up a few paychecks for your dress , Aly , ”
46531	46544	46545	46545	Britt	84	“ I mean we ’re definitely going all out for this one , ”
46557	46570	46571	46571	she	84	“ The cause means a lot to him , as you know , ”
46581	46600	46571	46571	she	84	“ Or maybe you do n’t know . Do you know what the gala ’s for this year ? ”
46612	46632	46609	46609	she	84	“ It ’s for heart disease . Because his dad died of a heart attack when he was eighteen . ”
46633	46640	46578	46578	her	84	“ Yes . I know that . ”
46641	46659	46609	46609	she	84	“ Really ? Were you at the funeral ? Because I do n’t think I saw you . ”
46667	46676	46677	46677	I	0	“ You were at Uncle George ’s funeral ? ”
46683	46689	46681	46681	myself	0	“ I mean – George . ”
46696	46712	46690	46690	Britt	84	“ Wow . Your families are so close you call his parents aunt and uncle ? ”

46736	46783	46784	46784	I	0	“ Yikes . Then why did n’t you go to the funeral ? Emmett was such a mess that day . It was so , so sad . I mean – to have your father and grandpa die within days of each other ? So horrible . ”
46845	46863	46864	46864	she	84	“ Poor thing . His life , his whole family – it was such a horrible mess , ”
46883	46904	46905	46905	She	84	“ But hey , look at him now ! Sexy , successful and sleeping with a new girl every week . ”
46912	46923	46905	46905	She	84	“ Wonder what adventures next week will bring . Right ? ”
46927	46944	46945	46945	she	61	“ Something tells me he might ’ve just found a girl to stick with for awhile , ”
46956	46978	46979	46979	Britt	84	“ Oh , bless your heart . You do n’t know about his ten - day rule then , do you ? ”
46982	46998	46979	46979	Britt	84	“ Do n’t worry . Just ask him – he ’s pretty open about it . ”
46999	47005	47006	47006	Evie	61	“ Totally . Will do , ”
47110	47113	47100	47100	Britt	84	“ horrible mess ”

47265	47275	47276	47276	she	61	“ Holy fuck – hot , hot , hot ! ”
47368	47371	47372	47372	he	56	“ Hey , ”
47390	47393	47372	47372	he	56	“ Hey . ”

47471	47476	47477	47477	she	832	“ Ibuprofen works wonders , ”
47487	47509	47510	47510	she	832	“ Now that you ’re feeling ‘ better than ever , ’ Emmett , are you ready to start our meeting ? ”

47845	47848	47849	47849	Evie	61	“ What ? ”
47869	47876	47857	47857	I	0	“ Was that weird just now ? ”
47877	47882	47883	47883	I	0	“ Was what weird ? ”
47996	48003	47991	47991	Evie	61	“ Aly … ? Still waiting . ”

48027	48042	48023	48023	I	0	“ But I just thought he ’d have … more to say to me ? ”
48051	48069	48048	48048	I	0	“ And be more excited to see me ? Oh God , I sound like an idiot . ”
48070	48074	48075	48075	Evie	61	“ Stop it , ”
48078	48099	48075	48075	Evie	61	“ You do n’t sound like an idiot . You ’re just over - thinking things because you like him . ”
48147	48182	48183	48183	Evie	61	“ He was totally excited to see you before . Do n’t hold it against him that he did n’t have an over - the - top reaction . Boys are just like that , ”

48244	48274	48275	48275	I	0	“ Are you upset because you were expecting him to want to do something bigger than delivery and TV ? Like , were you expecting a more formal date ? ”
48278	48285	48275	48275	I	0	“ I do n’t think so . ”
48301	48326	48298	48298	her	61	“ I do n’t know , Aly … I guess it ’s just hard to follow a night like last night . You know ? ”
48330	48361	48327	48327	She	61	“ Maybe he ’s tired . I mean the man did work last night . He pounded two orgasms outta you . I ’m sure that ’s no easy feat . ”
48371	48390	48364	48364	his	837	“ Okay , for the most part , I agree with you , but ya got ta stop , ”
48405	48428	48364	48364	his	837	“ We ’re gon na get sued for sexual harassment , so let ’s just … stop talking completely for a bit . ”
48429	48446	48447	48447	Evie	61	“ And what ? Listen to Britt fawn all over Emmett like a frickin ’ cornball ? ”
48467	48505	48452	48452	I	0	“ Emmett , you know I ’m going to be dressed to the nines for this party . I ’m gon na look so good you ’re gon na have to help me swat the men away . ”

48659	48666	48651	48651	Emmett	56	“ Hey . Right on time . ”
48667	48683	48684	48684	Emmett	56	“ Actually , I ’m super late – there was some receipt drama at closing . ”
48726	48741	48719	48719	he	56	“ All good . We ’ll just leave now to make up for it . ”
48745	48761	48719	48719	he	56	“ Wait – leave now ? I thought we were doing delivery and the game . ”
48762	48768	48769	48769	Emmett	56	“ Did I say delivery ? ”
48790	48803	48769	48769	Emmett	56	“ I … think , yes ? I mean you said sushi ... ”
48804	48830	48831	48831	he	56	“ Right . And I already ordered some from my favorite spot in the city . It ’ll be waiting for us at my suite , ”

48885	48894	48895	48895	Emmett	56	“ To watch the game at Empire Stadium ? ”
48905	48908	48895	48895	Emmett	56	“ Yeah , ”
48988	48991	48983	48983	he	56	“ What ? ”
48992	49000	49001	49001	I	0	“ I – I do n’t know . ”
49006	49036	49001	49001	I	0	“ It ’s just … the city ’s more than two hours away . Is n’t it ? The game will be over by the time we get there . ”
49037	49052	49056	49056	he	56	“ It would be if we were taking a car , would n’t it ? ”
49064	49078	49056	49056	he	56	“ Now come on . I got ta get us to our ride . ”
49206	49213	49214	49214	I	0	“ How is this your life ? ”
49228	49231	49214	49214	I	0	“ What ? ”
49232	49236	49237	49237	I	0	“ Never mind ! ”
49380	49391	49392	49392	I	0	“ Oh my God . I forgot there was more , ”
49523	49526	49527	49527	Emmett	56	“ Aly . ”
49558	49570	49571	49571	he	56	“ Can I steal you from the window for a sec ? ”
49584	49590	49571	49571	he	56	“ Sure . You okay ? ”
49591	49624	49625	49625	My	0	“ Yeah , I ’ve just been waiting to put my hands all over you since I woke up this morning , and I do n’t think I can last any longer . ”
49634	49636	49629	49629	I	0	“ oh ”
49702	49705	49706	49706	he	56	“ Hey , ”
49715	49718	49706	49706	he	56	“ Hi . ”
49719	49736	49737	49737	Lord	858	“ Waiting for you to come home today was the longest eight hours of my life . ”
49862	49875	49876	49876	I	0	“ Yeah , I pretty much thought about you all day too , ”
49912	49915	49916	49916	I	0	“ Really ? ”
49919	49945	49946	49946	Emmett	56	“ If you think that ’s anything I can help around you , then you still do n’t know how fucking crazy you make me , ”
49955	49981	49946	49946	Emmett	56	“ You have no idea how much it hurt to have my meeting at your place today and have to keep my hands to myself . ”
49982	49994	50037	50037	he	56	“ Is that why you barely said bye when you left ? ”
49995	50024	50025	50025	Emmett	56	“ Yeah . That and Britt was just asking me a million questions about you , and I felt like I had to get her out of there , ”
50048	50073	50074	50074	he	56	“ Christ . I ca n’t stand not touching you , but touching you makes me want to rip all your fucking clothes off , ”
50139	50142	50143	50143	I	0	“ Easy , ”
50146	50165	50143	50143	I	0	“ Let me help you cool down with a question I just need to get off my chest . ”
50166	50173	50218	50218	he	56	“ Uh - oh . What ? ”
50174	50188	50189	50189	I	0	“ What ’s this ten - day rule Britt Heatherton told me about ? ”
50192	50197	50189	50189	I	0	“ Is it real ? ”
50205	50213	50200	50200	his	56	“ Uh … yeah . It is . ”
50223	50247	50218	50218	he	56	“ Of course , you should know by now that you ’re the exception to any rule I ’ve ever made for myself . ”
50256	50259	50248	50248	I	0	“ Really . ”
50260	50263	50200	50200	his	56	“ Really . ”
50264	50294	50295	50295	I	0	“ And what other rules of yours have I broken ? Because I have to be honest , you do n’t really seem like a rules kind of guy , ”
50298	50320	50295	50295	I	0	“ Fair enough . I ’m not . But the few that I have , I ’ve already broken for you . ”
50321	50333	50200	50200	his	56	“ Ten - day thing aside , what else is there ? ”
50334	50339	50340	50340	Emmett	56	“ The roommate thing , ”
50343	50405	50406	50406	Emmett	56	“ I told myself when I was probably twenty years old that I ’d never live with someone again . My roommate in college … his name was Cam and he was such a slob . He ’d leave food everywhere and hook up with girls in my bed , so pretty much since him , I ’ve been flying solo . ”
50409	50416	50406	50406	Emmett	56	“ Unless you count my boy . ”
50417	50432	50479	50479	Emmett	56	“ Ozzy ? I think he ’s mad at me , by the way . ”
50433	50465	50479	50479	Emmett	56	“ Nah . He just likes the option of being able to sleep on my bed if he wants . He ’s spoiled . But he ’ll get used to you . ”
50466	50470	50471	50471	I	0	“ I see , ”
50647	50650	50651	50651	I	0	“ Emmett , ”
50674	50677	50658	50658	he	56	“ Emmett ! ”
50678	50687	50658	50658	he	56	“ Sorry . Might be addicted to these . ”
50688	50693	50694	50694	I	0	“ I can tell , ”
50738	50749	50732	50732	his	56	“ Oh God , what are you doing to me ? ”
50750	50757	50758	50758	he	56	“ This is what you get , ”
50761	50781	50782	50782	he	56	“ For every time you walked around the house without a bra on , I dreamt of doing this , ”
50796	50807	50791	50791	I	0	“ But I usually wore a bra around the house , ”
50815	50825	50808	50808	I	0	“ Usually . But the times you did n’t … ”
50826	50831	50786	50786	his	56	“ You could tell ? ”
50832	50853	50854	50854	Emmett	56	“ Yes . From the shape . The way you bounced . I think you gave me a new fetish , ”
50904	50932	50933	50933	Emmett	56	“ The night we watched that movie … these were so fucking hard I just wanted to rip your shirt off and suck on them all night , ”
51007	51018	51002	51002	his	56	“ Have you ever come from having your nipples sucked ? ”
51027	51044	51002	51002	his	56	“ The only time I almost did was with you . The night after the club . ”
51054	51057	51058	51058	he	56	“ Almost ? ”
51396	51399	51400	51400	I	0	“ Um . ”
51411	51421	51422	51422	I	0	“ So … wow . Definitely my first nipplegasm , ”
51531	51541	51542	51542	I	0	“ Oh God , Emmett , I tortured you , ”
51563	51577	51578	51578	he	56	“ It ’s not complete torture if I got to make you come , ”
51592	51612	51585	51585	I	0	“ Yeah , do n’t do that . yet . I , uh … I just need a minute . ”
51613	51618	51619	51620	Poor guy	873	“ Omigod . Okay . ”
51964	51974	51955	51955	I	0	“ Fucking hell . What are you doing here ? ”
51975	51989	51990	51990	Julian	73	“ I own the stadium , asshole . Good to see you too , ”
52026	52029	52030	52030	he	73	“ Aly , ”
52037	52062	52030	52030	he	73	“ Christ , it ’s been forever . I take it Emmett ’s been tolerable if you ’re choosing to join him this evening . ”
52063	52072	52073	52073	Aly	61	“ Yes , he has . Hi Julian , ”
52141	52146	52123	52123	she	74	“ I ’m pregnant ! ”
52154	52159	52160	52160	I	0	“ No fucking way , ”
52170	52183	52184	52184	Sara	74	“ I ’m sorry , I just had to get it out , ”
52205	52208	52199	52199	He	73	“ What ? ”
52209	52212	52213	52213	Sara	74	“ Nothing , ”
52226	52229	52220	52220	Julian	73	“ Yeah ? ”
52243	52255	52230	52230	His	73	“ You two literally could n’t be more suspicious right now . ”
52256	52280	52230	52230	His	73	“ You could n’t be more suspicious right now . Now get out of my suite , I ’m here with my woman . ”
52281	52285	52286	52286	Julian	73	“ Your woman ? ”
52352	52369	52370	52370	he	73	“ Are you serious , Emmett ? This is everything I told you not to do . ”
52391	52398	52399	52399	I	0	“ I do n’t know man , ”
52402	52407	52399	52399	I	0	“ Let me live . ”
52408	52414	52441	52441	Julian	73	“ How did this happen ? ”
52415	52440	52441	52441	Julian	73	“ It just did , ca n’t explain it . Hey , how are you and Sara , by the way ? Anything new ? ”
52492	52500	52501	52501	he	73	“ Did she say something to you ? ”
52504	52516	52501	52501	he	73	“ No . What would she say if she said something ? ”
52549	52552	52553	52553	he	73	“ Fuck , ”
52582	52608	52579	52579	his	73	“ I think she ’s pregnant . But she has n’t said anything yet , and I do n’t want to get my hopes up . ”
52669	52706	52707	52707	Julian	73	“ I do n’t know , man . If she is , she is . If she ’s not , she ’s not . But it would definitely be cool for Ozzy to have a cousin . ”
52710	52741	52707	52707	Julian	73	“ Right . I guess I should temper my kid ’s expectations of ever having a human cousin . Sara has no siblings and you … are who you are . ”
52742	52761	52762	52762	Julian	73	“ I ’m not entirely sure what you mean by that but I do think I ’m offended . ”
52765	52812	52762	52762	Julian	73	“ You realize you ca n’t let Mom find out about anything going on between you and Aly , right ? She ’s going to get so ahead of herself she ’ll probably have to be hospitalized for heartbreak if and when you two break up . ”
52813	52835	52836	52836	Julian	73	“ Jesus fuck , take it easy . And Aly is n’t going anywhere , alright ? I promise you that . ”
52891	52903	52904	52904	he	73	“ I know how much she ’s always meant to you , ”
52939	52967	52968	52968	I	0	“ I mean you definitely had a shitty way of showing it then , but here ’s to hoping that you can make up for it now . ”
52973	52983	52984	52984	I	0	“ That was actually really nice for your standards , ”
52990	53004	52984	52984	I	0	“ Yeah , well . Like you said , I ’m getting soft . ”
53005	53034	52987	52987	he	73	“ Definitely . On that topic , remind me that I owe Sara a million beers for making you that much more tolerable since you ’ve been together . ”
53035	53048	53049	53049	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’ll remind you in nine months , hopefully . ”
53106	53115	53116	53116	I	0	“ Julian ’s going to be a dad , ”
53136	53149	53126	53126	I	0	“ Oh my God . Your mom ’s going to freak out ! ”
53160	53164	53165	53165	I	0	“ Holy shit , ”
53250	53257	53258	53258	I	0	“ Man . He needed this , ”
53271	53289	53258	53258	I	0	“ He really did . He ’s been waiting to be a dad for a long time . ”
53290	53293	53294	53294	Aly	61	“ Seriously ? ”
53297	53327	53328	53328	I	0	“ I mean I remember him always being good with kids , but I also remember him saying that he was ‘ a hundred percent never having children . ’ ”
53336	53352	53328	53328	I	0	“ Yeah , well . I think he changed his mind after our dad died . ”
53358	53361	53362	53362	She	61	“ Oh . ”
53376	53383	53362	53362	She	61	“ I guess that makes sense . ”
53384	53387	53388	53388	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
53438	53441	53442	53442	I	0	“ What ? ”
53445	53450	53451	53451	she	61	“ I feel bad , ”
53455	53459	53451	53451	she	61	“ For what ? ”
53460	53479	53483	53483	she	61	“ For not being there when your dad died . For not knowing your grandpa died right after . ”
53565	53576	53577	53577	he	60	“ This is why I ’m grateful for Charlie Stanton , ”
53581	53638	53577	53577	he	60	“ He ’s visited Grandpa more than your aunts and uncles have . He sends flowers . He ’s been here for me the way my real brothers and sisters have n’t been , and that ’s why you , me – all the Hoults will treat him like blood . Always . No matter what . ”
53730	53746	53747	53747	Aly	61	“ Honestly , I think I learned what family was from yours more than mine , ”
53757	53780	53747	53747	Aly	61	“ In some ways , I ca n’t blame my dad for idolizing your family so much . You guys were perfect . ”
53781	53787	53788	53788	Aly	61	“ Until we were n’t . ”
53806	53831	53788	53788	Aly	61	“ I know something happened after your dad passed … but I do n’t know what it was , and I feel horrible asking . ”
53837	53868	53788	53788	Aly	61	“ Do n’t . We were n’t exactly open about it . It was a fucked up time . It was n’t the way Mom wanted people to see us . ”
53869	53875	53912	53912	Aly	61	“ What do you mean ? ”
53876	53885	53886	53886	I	0	“ Dad died after a fight with Julian , ”
53916	53949	53912	53912	Aly	61	“ Nobody knows about this . Most people think Julian went away because he was depressed . They definitely did n’t think it was because Mom blamed him for Dad ’s death . ”
53950	53966	53970	53970	her	61	“ I remember my mom mentioning that Julian took a job overseas at one point , ”
53982	54023	53975	53975	she	61	“ I remember her saying how smart he was . For getting a change of scenery to help get over things . She said she ’d always wanted to go to Sweden . That ’s where he went , right ? ”
54024	54038	54039	54039	I	0	“ Yeah . Everyone spins everything we do into something cool or glamorous , ”
54050	54086	54039	54039	I	0	“ But the truth was that for a good five years after Dad died , we were barely a family anymore . None of us were talking for awhile . Not to Julian at least . ”
54094	54107	54039	54039	I	0	“ Not even you ? But you guys were always so close . ”
54108	54171	54172	54172	I	0	“ Well , he was far away . And while he was gone , he made some decisions that made us feel like he was going to stay away for good . And Mom was n’t doing well . Gram was n’t either . They ’d both lost their husbands in one week , so they were my priority . Not Julian , ”
54195	54203	54188	54188	I	0	“ So it was all on you ? ”
54218	54229	54212	54212	she	61	“ You were eighteen years old and everyone ’s rock ? ”
54261	54281	54282	54282	I	0	“ That ’s why I ’m excited to start building on the family again . We all needed this , ”
54297	54306	54307	54307	she	61	“ You ’re going to be an uncle , ”
54322	54336	54307	54307	she	61	“ Fun Uncle Emmett . That ’s got a nice ring to it . ”
54337	54340	54341	54341	I	0	“ Definitely , ”
54674	54678	54679	54679	I	0	“ Holy shit , ”
54733	54781	54719	54719	Emmett	56	“ We can stay here tonight if you want . Julian ’s already back in the Hamptons , so I ’ll have him take Ozzy for the night . And then I ’ll get up early with you so we can head back to the Hamptons together . ”
54796	54803	54793	54793	he	56	“ In the helicopter . Yes . ”
54829	54856	54818	54818	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I obviously want to but I have to get to work early tomorrow to take care of this stupid thing . ”
54857	54862	54793	54793	he	56	“ What stupid thing ? ”
54863	54917	54918	54918	I	0	“ My liquor license . It ’s about to expire and the new application got delayed , so I need to take care of that before we have to shut down our booze program . The brunch people would pretty much lose their minds if they could n’t order their Bloody Mary ’s , ”
54929	54934	54918	54918	I	0	“ Hey . Easy . ”
54962	54982	54983	54983	he	56	“ I know people at the liquor authority . I can just make a call and push it through , ”
54997	55002	54983	54983	he	56	“ Are you serious ? ”
55003	55009	55010	55010	he	56	“ Yeah . Sound good ? ”
55022	55035	55010	55010	he	56	“ Why even hesitate about this if it makes your life easier ? ”
55036	55066	55014	55014	his	56	“ I do n’t know . Because I ’m not used to getting things so easy . It makes me feel guilty . Like I did n’t earn it . ”
55067	55081	55082	55082	Emmett	56	“ You ’ve busted your ass for everything in your life so far , ”
55089	55122	55123	55123	he	56	“ So cash in on my luck for once . You know you deserve it . Especially if it means we get to spend the night here instead of heading back now , ”
55131	55153	55123	55123	he	56	“ It ’s just so late already and I want us to be able to relax for a bit before bed . ”
55181	55183	55169	55169	his	56	“ relax ”
55187	55189	55169	55169	his	56	“ us ”
55207	55210	55211	55211	I	0	“ Okay , ”
55223	55237	55218	55218	he	56	“ Let ’s do it then . Let ’s just stay here tonight . ”
55363	55375	55353	55353	Emmett	56	“ Do n’t look in there . It ’s a mess . ”
55376	55388	55389	55389	I	0	“ Really ? That ’s a mess to you these days ? ”
55458	55468	55469	55469	I	0	“ I do n’t know how to talk anymore , ”
55477	55494	55469	55469	I	0	“ You were expressing surprise for the fact that I ’m not a teenaged slob anymore , ”
55506	55558	55495	55495	Emmett	56	“ Oh yeah ! Oh God , you used to shed your shoes and socks while going up the stairs and leave like , a trail of your clothes down the hall . I also remember never being able to see more than a few inches of floor in your room . ”
55559	55577	55578	55578	Emmett	56	“ Well , we ’ve established that I ’ve changed a pretty good amount since high school , ”
55581	55611	55578	55578	Emmett	56	“ Plus , living in the same building as Julian means him dropping by unannounced all the time , which means I got ta keep this place looking good . ”
55612	55631	55632	55632	I	0	“ Oh , and you ’re going to have to start baby - proofing a couple rooms too , ”
55679	55692	55693	55693	he	56	“ Yeah . Man . We definitely got a lot to do , ”
55707	55719	55720	55720	he	56	“ I wonder if it ’s a boy or a girl , ”
55728	55735	55736	55736	I	0	“ Do you have a preference ? ”
55808	55816	55817	55817	he	56	“ I know Julian wants a girl , ”
55820	55850	55817	55817	he	56	“ So I ’m gon na root for a girl , too . But either way , it ’s going to be awesome to have a baby Hoult around . ”
55851	55869	55870	55870	I	0	“ Mm - hm . Fun uncle ’s gon na be a pretty natural role for you , ”
55873	55876	55877	55877	he	56	“ Definitely , ”
55904	55921	55922	55922	he	56	“ Though it kind of sucks that my kids wo n’t have their own fun uncle , ”
55936	55943	55944	55944	he	56	“ Because Julian ’s so serious , ”
55951	55972	55973	55973	I	0	“ No , yeah , I got that . I think I was just … surprised that you wanted kids , ”
55987	55995	55981	55981	my	0	“ Because you ’re so against relationships ? ”
56002	56007	56008	56008	he	56	“ I ’m not , ”
56018	56036	56037	56037	I	0	“ But you wo n’t let yourself have one . Not after that one girlfriend in college , ”
56104	56121	56122	56122	he	56	“ I did n’t let myself commit to anyone because I did n’t think I could , ”
56130	56163	56122	56122	he	56	“ Even if I wanted to , I had … reasons for why I ’d have to up and leave out of nowhere . And that would n’t be fair to her . ”
56204	56246	56247	56247	he	56	“ I made that whole ten - day rule so I would n’t be tempted to get attached to anyone . I know it happens when you ’ve been with someone long enough , and I did n’t want to risk , ”
56262	56270	56271	56271	he	56	“ What ’s that face , Aly ? ”
56278	56297	56271	56271	he	56	“ I do n’t know . I guess I do n’t like hearing about your no relationships rule . ”
56298	56320	56321	56321	he	56	“ Fair . But like I said before , you ’ve always been the exception to any one of my rules , ”
56331	56347	56321	56321	he	56	“ I do n’t have a choice when it comes to being attached to you , ”
56352	56387	56348	56348	Emmett	56	“ I am and I ’ve been . For as long as I can remember . You ’re just a way of life for me that I do n’t want to give up again . ”
56393	56400	56401	56401	I	0	“ What exactly are you saying ? ”
56456	56489	56490	56490	he	56	“ I ’m saying that I ’ve been waiting twelve years for you , and I do n’t want anyone else . I want to be with you , and only you , ”
56534	56539	56540	56540	he	56	“ So you in ? ”
56574	56577	56578	56578	I	0	“ Obviously , ”
56591	56596	56582	56582	he	56	“ I ’m in . ”
56643	56645	56646	56646	them	937	“ destroyed ”
56875	56885	56886	56886	he	72	“ Hey . I come in peace , alright ? ”
56898	56910	56911	56911	I	0	“ You ’re a fuckin ’ asshole , you know that ? ”
56922	56932	56933	56933	he	86	“ Whoa , hey , what ’s going on ? ”
56950	56964	56965	56965	Drew	72	“ Nothing . Emmett ’s just pissed that I ’m an exceptional wingman , ”
56976	56985	56965	56965	Drew	72	“ Yeah ? Is that what that was ? ”
57005	57020	57021	57021	Iain	86	“ Somehow I ’m lost on how you kissing Aly is winging for me . ”
57031	57044	57045	57045	Drew	72	“ You kissed his girl ? The fuck is wrong with you ? ”
57051	57089	57047	57047	his	72	“ What ? It was n’t real . There was no tongue . I was just doing it to piss off Emmett to piss off Beth . Because Beth pissed off Ellie . Does that make sense ? ”
57102	57113	57114	57114	I	0	“ He did n’t get any of the names right , ”
57117	57120	57114	57114	I	0	“ Ah . ”
57121	57124	57125	57125	Drew	72	“ Whatever , ”
57142	57153	57154	57154	he	72	“ I maintain that I did a good thing there , ”
57159	57218	57154	57154	he	72	“ If it were n’t for me , you would ’ve wasted your time on that platonic shit for who knows how long . And at some point , someone would ’ve snatched her up , and you would ’ve turned into a mopey little shit because you ’ve pretty much wanted this girl since your balls dropped . ”
57219	57226	57227	57227	Drew	72	“ What are you talking about ? ”
57230	57297	57227	57227	Drew	72	“ Dude . Whether you realize it or not , you talked about this girl fucking constantly . Even before she came back into the picture . You never mentioned her by name but half your stories from childhood involved ‘ that friend I grew up with , ’ and you always referred to that friend as a she so I put two and two together . ”
57298	57301	57302	57302	Iain	86	“ Wow , ”
57314	57319	57320	57320	Drew	72	“ That ’s right , ”
57326	57395	57320	57320	Drew	72	“ I know you think you ’re slick , Hoult , but you ’re not . I mean I ’m not the most detail - oriented guy , so if I noticed that you ’re in love with this girl then you ’re in love with her . And you should n’t have even wasted your time on the friends shit . End of story . Mic drop . ”
57401	57411	57320	57320	Drew	72	“ It was good until the last few words . ”
57412	57445	57446	57446	I	0	“ Yeah . I ’m gon na take that as a thank you , and to that I say fuck you . Now I ’m the only bachelor left in the group . ”
57462	57480	57481	57481	Iain	86	“ Yeah , well maybe if you stop chasing girls with a history of trespassing and stalking , ”
57493	57507	57508	57508	Drew	72	“ Hey , a lot of the crazy ones happen to be beautiful , ”
57519	57543	57544	57544	Iain	86	“ Yeah , well Emmett just scored him a beautiful , sane woman so stop making excuses and get out of my office , ”
57554	57568	57544	57544	Iain	86	“ I have a meeting and you have physical therapy in an hour . ”
57569	57574	57575	57575	Drew	72	“ Jesus . Fine , ”
57581	57593	57575	57575	Drew	72	“ What are you doing , E ? Wanna get food ? ”
57594	57601	57602	57602	I	0	“ I ’m Iain ’s meeting , ”
57618	57664	57665	57665	I	0	“ But I owe you dinner for your non - traditional winging , alright ? It ’s going to take me a second to believe that you pulled that shit for noble purposes , but if you did , you did a damned good job , ”
57668	57690	57691	57691	Drew	72	“ Yeah , yeah . Probably gon na be my last night out with you before you get all wifed up , ”
57722	57729	57730	57730	I	0	“ Nice client you ’ve got , ”
57733	57751	57730	57730	I	0	“ Hey , I ’m only associated to that prick through work . What ’s your excuse ? ”
57787	57796	57776	57776	he	86	“ So you bringing Aly to the gala ? ”
57797	57807	57776	57776	he	86	“ Hopefully . I have n’t asked her yet . ”
57808	57812	57776	57776	he	86	“ Why not ? ”
57813	57829	57776	57776	he	86	“ Have n’t really had the time . It ’s kind of been a whirlwind . ”
57830	57839	57840	57840	I	0	“ Well , how serious are you two ? ”
57848	57855	57840	57840	I	0	“ Why are you grilling me ? ”
57856	57861	57862	57862	he	86	“ You know why , ”
57871	57885	57862	57862	he	86	“ I ’m curious about whether or not you ’ve told her about – ”
57886	57889	57890	57890	I	0	“ No , ”
57896	57910	57890	57890	I	0	“ I have n’t . And I do n’t plan on it either . ”
57911	57914	57915	57915	He	86	“ Whoa . ”
57921	57951	57952	57952	he	86	“ That ’s fine , Emmett . I ’m just wondering so I know what I ’m allowed to say around her when I see her at the gala , ”
57967	57975	57976	57976	he	86	“ What are you so tense about ? ”
57979	58009	57976	57976	he	86	“ You really do n’t have anything to feel guilty about . What you did was ages ago . Well before you thought you ’d ever see Aly again . ”
58083	58093	58094	58094	Iain	86	“ Trust me , Emmett . You ’re good , ”
58102	58160	58097	58097	He	86	“ I mean if all the things Drew said before were true , then this is the one and only girl you ’ve really cared about your whole life . So if she ever finds out about all the shit , I ’m sure she ’ll be able to look past it . Trust me on that ? ”
58161	58164	58165	58165	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
58176	58180	58165	58165	I	0	“ Sure thing . ”
58434	58441	58411	58411	I	0	“ Go , go , go . ”
58814	58817	58818	58818	Aly	61	“ Emmett ? ”
58831	58838	58839	58839	I	0	“ Shit . I ’m sorry , ”
58922	58931	58932	58932	she	61	“ Mm . Sounds like a long day , ”
58960	58977	58978	58978	I	0	“ It was pretty long . But it felt longer because I was away from you , ”
59031	59043	59044	59044	I	0	“ Listen , I ’ve been meaning to ask you something , ”
59075	59080	59081	59081	Aly	61	“ What ’s up ? ”
59091	59107	59108	59108	I	0	“ I was wondering if you ’d be my date for the gala next week , ”
59118	59130	59108	59108	I	0	“ Why do you seem surprised to hear me ask that ? ”
59131	59153	59154	59154	she	61	“ I do n’t know . Because I ’m sleepy and I have trouble hiding my reactions when I ’m sleepy , ”
59158	59207	59154	59154	she	61	“ And I guess because it ’s just … such a big , important thing for you . Full of fancy people . I just thought you might not want to bring me as a date . ‘ Cause then you ’ll have to introduce me to everyone . ”
59208	59213	59214	59214	Aly	61	“ Yeah . Exactly . ”
59217	59226	59227	59227	she	61	“ You want to introduce me to everyone ? ”
59230	59237	59227	59227	she	61	“ As your … you know ? ”
59238	59241	59242	59242	I	0	“ Girlfriend ? ”
59258	59266	59242	59242	I	0	“ Yeah , Aly . I do . ”
59267	59275	59227	59227	she	61	“ So I can call you my … ”
59276	59284	59285	59285	I	0	“ Boyfriend ? Jesus Christ . Yes , ”
59358	59363	59349	59349	I	0	“ Aly . What ? ”
59364	59373	59374	59374	she	61	“ I do n’t have anything to wear , ”
59377	59380	59374	59374	she	61	“ Huh ? ”
59381	59402	59403	59403	I	0	“ To your gala . If it ’s black tie , I definitely do n’t have anything appropriate to wear . ”
59413	59427	59428	59428	I	0	“ So ? Then I ’ll just have to take you shopping tomorrow , ”
59441	59451	59428	59428	I	0	“ No . Do n’t do that , Emmett … ”
59452	59456	59480	59480	her	61	“ Why not ? ”
59457	59473	59474	59474	she	61	“ I do n’t have the money to pay you back for a nice dress , ”
59482	59494	59477	59477	I	0	“ Have you never had a boyfriend buy you gifts before ? ”
59495	59504	59505	59505	she	61	“ I … have . But small things , ”
59512	59521	59505	59505	she	61	“ Not big things . Or expensive things . ”
59522	59555	59556	59556	I	0	“ Yeah , well , we ’ve already established that your exes were idiots , so let ’s make this the last time you compare me to them ever again , alright ? ”
59565	59568	59569	59569	she	61	“ Fine , ”
59586	59593	59594	59594	she	61	“ It ’s no contest anyway , ”
59818	59842	59843	59843	Evie	61	“ Poor Teddy . I do n’t think he even knew how much this estrogen - fest of a restaurant was affecting him , ”
59858	59870	59871	59871	I	0	“ Yeah , he just needed a boy to talk to , ”
59885	59913	59874	59874	Hannah	93	“ Yeah , that ’s not a boy though . That ’s a man . That ’s like , the Merriam - Webster definition of a man . ”
59914	59935	59936	59936	Evie	61	“ Really ? So if I look in the dictionary , there ’ll be a picture of Aly ’s boyfriend ? ”
59951	59954	59940	59940	I	0	“ boyfriend . ”
60040	60052	60053	60053	Evie	61	“ Hey . So I have good news and bad news , ”
60067	60076	60077	60077	I	0	“ Hit me with the bad news first , ”
60080	60084	60077	60077	I	0	“ Got it , ”
60112	60115	60116	60116	I	0	“ Evie , ”
60119	60139	60116	60116	I	0	“ I already know that they canceled their reservation for Sunday . Hannah told me when I came in . ”
60143	60146	60147	60147	She	61	“ Oh . ”
60152	60159	60147	60147	She	61	“ And you ’re not upset ? ”
60211	60260	60261	60261	I	0	“ I honestly knew this was going to happen the day my mom called and said ‘ book that day , we ’re coming . ’ She wants to make it happen , but he does n’t , and in the end she ’ll always yield to him , ”
60270	60290	60261	60261	I	0	“ But do n’t be upset . I ’m … slightly more at peace about this whole thing now . ”
60291	60296	60267	60267	her	61	“ Because of Emmett ? ”
60297	60300	60301	60301	I	0	“ Maybe , ”
60304	60343	60344	60344	I	0	“ I just feel a little clearer in my head , if that makes sense . And I feel happy now in a way I do n’t think I ’ve … ever been ? In my whole life ? ”
60353	60401	60344	60344	I	0	“ And it makes me kind of anxious because I feel like there ’s got ta be a catch . But it feels way too good for me to stop , so I guess I ’m just gon na ride the high till the other shoe drops . ”
60434	60451	60452	60452	she	61	“ Woman . There is no need to be that negative . Sometimes good things last , ”
60463	60516	60456	60456	she	61	“ I know I ’m not the best person to sell that point because me and Mike are … whatever we are … but if I can tell you one thing for sure , it ’s that I ’ve never seen you smile as hard as you ’ve smiled all day today . ”
60523	60536	60537	60537	I	0	“ He ’s definitely helping me relax and enjoy myself for once , ”
60541	60553	60537	60537	I	0	“ Which is … still kind of weird to think about . ”
60654	60663	60664	60664	Evie	61	“ Well , you know what I say ? ”
60687	60694	60695	60695	she	61	“ I say you deserve it , ”
60705	60710	60695	60695	she	61	“ And so do I. ”
60711	60717	60718	60718	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
60721	60737	60738	60738	she	61	“ I mean the application for or new liquor license got magically pushed through today , ”
60749	60794	60738	60738	she	61	“ And since I ’m pretty sure it was your eight - pack - havin’ boyfriend who helped us out with that , I ’m gon na tell you now to fuck him extra good tonight . As a thank you from us both . ”
60795	60803	60804	60804	I	0	“ Oh . My God , Evie , ”
60814	60828	60829	60829	she	61	“ Sorry . For that , I ’ll finish closing on my own , ”
60845	60862	60829	60829	she	61	“ Now go shop with your man . He ’s been waiting long enough for you . ”
61022	61030	61031	61031	Emmett	56	“ None for me , thank you , ”
61042	61056	61031	61031	Emmett	56	“ But I ’m sure my girlfriend would n’t mind taking my share . ”
61118	61121	61110	61110	Emmett	56	“ So , ”
61132	61148	61122	61122	Rose	121	“ I take it you ’re the lucky one who stole him away from us ? ”
61156	61161	61122	61122	Rose	121	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
61162	61202	61203	61203	she	121	“ Oh , the shop girls and I – we go to Blue Harbor for drinks after our shifts . We usually see Emmett there with his friends most nights , but not so much the past few weeks , ”
61223	61235	61236	61236	she	121	“ Is it because he ’s been staying home with you ? ”
61243	61246	61236	61236	she	121	“ Oh . ”
61251	61256	61257	61257	I	0	“ Actually … maybe , ”
61303	61315	61316	61316	She	121	“ Well then whatever you ’re doing , keep doing it . ”
61331	61357	61316	61316	She	121	“ Because that man ’s definitely never liked a girl enough to stay home for her – or go shopping with her for that matter . ”
61363	61370	61316	61316	She	121	“ And you know this because ? ”
61371	61391	61392	61392	Rose	121	“ Because tracking that man ’s relationship status is just a thing we do in this town every summer , ”
61405	61413	61398	61398	she	121	“ At least it was until now . ”
61414	61420	61421	61421	I	0	“ Huh . I see , ”
61548	61558	61559	61559	he	56	“ Baby . Did you find anything you like ? ”
61568	61570	61565	61565	him	56	“ baby ”
61621	61624	61615	61615	I	0	“ Whoa . ”
61651	61655	61656	61656	Emmett	122	“ That ’s ... ”
61685	61693	61694	61694	he	122	“ Yeah . That ’s the one , ”
61709	61712	61694	61694	he	122	“ Right ? ”
61721	61743	61744	61744	I	0	“ I think so . I just need to make sure it fits . Will you zip the back for me ? ”
61781	61792	61793	61793	he	122	“ It ’s actually painful how fucking beautiful you are , ”
61821	61837	61838	61838	I	0	“ Why does it look like zipping me up takes every ounce of your strength ? ”
61841	61858	61838	61838	I	0	“ Because that ’s exactly what it does when all I ever want is you naked . ”
61957	61962	61963	61963	I	0	“ I love it , ”
62057	62060	62061	62061	I	0	“ Sure , ”
62264	62267	62268	62268	I	0	“ Emmett … ”
62370	62373	62374	62374	he	315	“ Christ , ”
62384	62391	62392	62392	he	315	“ Is this becoming a habit ? ”
62411	62417	62418	62418	I	0	“ I took them off , ”

62442	62447	62448	62448	He	315	“ Mm - hm . ”
62496	62508	62509	62509	Emmett	122	“ You ’re so wet you ’re dripping down your thighs , ”
62518	62531	62532	62532	I	0	“ Well , what do you want me to do about it ? ”
62546	62572	62573	62573	he	315	“ I want to watch you sink that pussy down to the base of my cock . That ’s what I want you to do , ”
62603	62628	62584	62584	he	315	“ But since I do n’t have a condom , I ’ll settle for watching you while I make you come in this dress . ”
62675	62680	62681	62681	he	315	“ You ’re soaked , ”
62725	62738	62739	62739	he	315	“ Fuck , baby , do n’t clench so tight around me , ”
62751	62761	62739	62739	he	315	“ You ’re making my dick so fucking hard . ”
62762	62768	62769	62769	I	0	“ Let me feel it , ”
62835	62841	62842	62842	I	0	“ I want it inside , ”
62850	62860	62842	62842	I	0	“ Do n’t say that to me right now . ”
62861	62866	62867	62867	I	0	“ I mean it , ”
62877	62894	62867	62867	I	0	“ I ’m on the pill , and I ’m clean , so if you are … ”
62973	62976	62977	62977	Emmett	122	“ Aly , ”
62988	62992	62977	62977	Emmett	122	“ Holy fuck . ”
63083	63092	63093	63093	Emmett	122	“ Yes , baby . Ride my cock , ”
63111	63116	63117	63117	he	122	“ That ’s right , ”
63158	63172	63173	63173	he	122	“ You ’re getting my dick so wet with your juices , baby , ”
63334	63340	63341	63341	Emmett	122	“ Do it , baby , ”
63344	63356	63341	63341	Emmett	122	“ Come all over my cock . Let me feel it . ”
63646	63648	63629	63629	I	0	“ real ”
63845	63849	63831	63831	Emmett	56	“ stay with me ”
63851	63856	63831	63831	Emmett	56	“ five more minutes , ”
63957	63969	63972	63972	Evie	61	“ That ’s a good problem , ya ding - dong . ”
64030	64033	64034	64034	I	0	“ Morning , ”
64444	64448	64449	64449	I	0	“ Good morning ? ”
64502	64506	64507	64507	he	56	“ ’ Morning , ”
64553	64556	64549	64549	he	56	“ Hey . ”
64557	64561	64562	64562	I	0	“ Hey yourself , ”
64582	64593	64576	64576	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you ’re up this early . ”
64594	64606	64607	64607	he	56	“ I wanted you to have a nice breakfast before work , ”
64622	64650	64607	64607	he	56	“ I cleaned up the stuff on the dining room table and put it in your folder , which should save you a couple minutes , right ? ”
64659	64664	64651	64651	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
64770	64783	64765	64765	I	0	“ Emmett … for lack of better words , what the fuck ? ”
64813	64846	64805	64805	he	56	“ I feel like I ’m at some super fancy restaurant . Do you realize how much money a restaurant could make if you were the chef and you served everyone shirtless ? ”
64847	64867	64789	64789	I	0	“ That ’s definitely an idea . But I only bust out these moves for a select few people . ”
64868	64895	64938	64938	he	56	“ That ’s smart , because if you did this for any of your hook - ups , they ’d fall instantly in love with you . ”
64896	64908	64909	64909	Emmett	56	“ Is that what you ’re doing with me right now ? ”
64943	64959	64938	64938	he	56	“ You need cream for you coffee , right ? Half - and - half ? ”
64960	64968	64938	64938	he	56	“ Yes . I can get it – ”
64969	64990	64991	64991	I	0	“ No , I ’ll get it . Start eating . You only have a little more than ten minutes . ”
65032	65050	65051	65051	I	0	“ Emmett . This is delicious . This is better than stuff I ’ve had at restaurants , ”
65065	65077	65078	65078	I	0	“ When the hell did you learn to cook like this ? ”
65081	65102	65103	65103	He	56	“ When we were in high school , you used to set off the fire alarm while using the microwave . ”
65106	65124	65103	65103	He	56	“ Yeah . I think it was actually a talent how bad I was at cooking then . ”
65125	65133	65156	65156	he	56	“ You messed up instant ramen once . ”
65134	65138	65103	65103	He	56	“ Sure did . ”
65139	65146	65147	65147	I	0	“ So … explanations ? Please ? ”
65185	65207	65156	65156	he	56	“ When I was in college , my other roommate Lukas taught me the basics . Mostly how to cook eggs . ”
65208	65219	65220	65220	I	0	“ Where ’d you learn the rest of it then ? ”
65223	65246	65220	65220	I	0	“ How ’d you learn to prep and time and plate so perfectly ? Because I ’m kind of amazed right now . ”
65262	65268	65269	65269	he	56	“ I do n’t know , ”
65273	65296	65269	65269	he	56	“ I just had to learn . I needed to feed myself . The cafeteria food at college was n’t the best . ”
65304	65358	65297	65297	I	0	“ You used to eat plain cold cuts in high school because you were too lazy to get bread from the pantry . I also recall the fact that you were happy to eat multiple bowls of cereal for dinner , because ‘ cereal ’s already here and ordering out takes time . ’ ”
65369	65380	65381	65381	he	56	“ That ’s … yep . That ’s completely accurate , ”
65392	65414	65415	65415	he	56	“ Speaking of dinner though , one of my friends opened a restaurant in Montauk . Can I take you tonight ? ”
65454	65458	65459	65459	I	0	“ Of course , ”
65462	65475	65459	65459	I	0	“ Is it a super fancy place that requires me dressing nicely ? ”
65476	65497	65498	65498	Emmett	56	“ No , but if you want some new dresses , I ’m more than happy to go shopping again , ”
65505	65527	65498	65498	Emmett	56	“ You better not talk about that because we do n’t have the time to get all turned on right now . ”
65528	65533	65534	65534	Emmett	56	“ Fuck . True , ”
65550	65559	65534	65534	Emmett	56	“ You got two minutes to finish eating . ”
65560	65580	65581	65581	I	0	“ No way am I gon na finish all this , but I ’m already very full and content , ”
65595	65603	65581	65581	I	0	“ But you should definitely finish it . ”
65604	65613	65534	65534	Emmett	56	“ I ’ll save the hash for later . ”
65614	65626	65627	65627	I	0	“ Why ? Going right back to bed once I leave ? ”
65630	65639	65640	65640	he	56	“ You bet your sexy ass I am , ”
65735	65743	65748	65748	she	61	“ I have fish guts on me , ”
65786	65790	65777	65777	she	61	“ Got it . ”
65791	65824	65825	65825	she	61	“ Do n’t come near me ! I ’m gross and I need to pop in the shower real quick , but I wo n’t make us late for dinner – promise ! ”
65843	65851	65852	65852	I	0	“ Now you get five more minutes , ”
66409	66412	66413	66413	I	0	“ Hey ! ”
66564	66566	66573	66573	I	0	“ Congratulations ”
66681	66684	66685	66685	she	66	“ Hey ! ”
66705	66715	66685	66685	she	66	“ What ’s up ? What ’s going on ? ”
66724	66726	66718	66718	my	0	“ nothing ”
66736	66741	66718	66718	my	0	“ I love you . ”
66828	66836	66825	66825	she	66	“ I love you , Emmett Hoult . ”
66839	66852	66813	66813	she	66	“ I have something to ask you and something to tell you . ”
67026	67030	67020	67020	I	0	“ Hit me . ”
67031	67042	67043	67043	Emmett	56	“ When was the last time you saw your dad ? ”
67055	67063	67064	67064	I	0	“ Um . Maybe December for Christmas ? ”
67082	67190	67191	67191	Emmett	56	“ Wow . It ’s weird . It does n’t feel that long ago because I know he ’s so close by . And I still hear him in the background when my mom calls every week . I mean talk sometimes , too . Never for more than a minute or so , but it ’s just the relationship I have with him . And I ’ve obviously always wanted more , but it is what it is . I ’m too exhausted to try to talk to him about it now . Besides , it does n’t break my heart on a daily basis anymore . ”
67218	67239	67240	67240	he	56	“ I was really happy when Mom told me you bought his company . I thought that would fix everything , ”
67244	67247	67240	67240	he	56	“ Yeah , ”
67255	67285	67286	67286	I	0	“ Me too . Though I ’m starting to realize that I ’m still happy with all the choices I made . All the hard work I put in , ”
67299	67355	67286	67286	I	0	“ Even if it did n’t work to win his approval , it ’s still the first thing I did on my own . And I do n’t know why , but the more I work and the more established the restaurant gets , the less I feel the need to prove myself to him . ”
67356	67366	67367	67367	Emmett	56	“ Because you ’ve already proved yourself to yourself , ”
67376	67419	67420	67420	he	56	“ You ’re a fucking rock star . Not a lot of people can do what you did and sacrifice so much of their lives to achieving a goal . God knows I do n’t have that kind of hustle in me , ”
67423	67431	67420	67420	he	56	“ That ’s not true , Emmett , ”
67447	67473	67432	67432	I	0	“ Maybe you had a head start , but that does n’t mean you did n’t have to keep working to maintain everything you have . ”
67474	67488	67489	67489	Emmett	56	“ That ’s definitely a good word to describe my life . Maintenance , ”
67513	67537	67508	67508	he	56	“ Anyway , the other thing I meant to tell you is that your dad might show up to the gala on Saturday . ”
67541	67549	67538	67538	He	56	“ Will that be okay for you ? ”
67563	67566	67567	67567	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
67571	67594	67567	67567	I	0	“ That ’s fine , honestly . I ’d kind of stopped expecting things from Dad awhile ago . And I think , ”
67604	67662	67595	67595	I	0	“ that when you knocked some sense into me the morning after I moved out , I realized … as sad as it sounds … that I was holding onto something that was never there . There never really was hope to get him to love me – not the way I always wanted , at least . ”
67663	67666	67667	67667	Emmett	56	“ Aly , ”
67675	67696	67667	67667	Emmett	56	“ I ’m sorry for everything I said that day . I know it was harsh , and it was – ”
67697	67700	67701	67701	I	0	“ True , ”
67716	67765	67766	67766	I	0	“ Everything you said that day was true , Emmett , and the fact that I avoided you all those years kind of proves it . I knew you were the only one who knew me well enough to call me out and pull me out of delusion , ”
67769	67854	67855	67855	I	0	“ And as hard as it as to accept that I ’d lied to myself most of my life , it was also a huge weight off my back . Because now I do n’t actually want to try anymore . I ’m not living to impress my dad . Holding out hope for someone who does n’t even think about you on a daily basis is pretty much the most painful waste of time in the world , and I realize that now , ”
67873	67892	67858	67858	My	0	“ I realized it too late , but at least I did at all . Thanks to you . ”
67908	67917	67918	67918	he	1047	“ You ’re impressive . You know that ? ”
67931	67938	67918	67918	he	1047	“ Why are you saying this ? ”
67939	67956	67957	67957	Emmett	56	“ Because you ’re strong and smart , and you ’ve done everything on your own , ”
67961	68044	68045	68045	Emmett	56	“ You ’ve been knocked down however many times , and you ’ve never stayed on the ground . I do n’t know what that ’s like . My dad used to say , ‘ When it comes to the race of life , you two were dropped off way ahead of the others . You should always know and remember that . ’ And I did , but it never hit me quite as hard as it ’s hitting me now , ”
68053	68066	68048	68048	he	1047	“ And it just makes me that much more amazed by you . ”
68117	68128	68104	68104	Emmett	56	“ Well , before you get too proud of me , ”
68133	68149	68150	68150	Emmett	56	“ I feel like I should admit that I have a petty side to me . ”
68153	68156	68150	68150	Emmett	56	“ Yeah ? ”
68157	68215	68109	68109	his	56	“ Oh yeah . As much as I ’m getting over my whole thing with Dad , I still want to hear him admit that I did good – and not just good , but better than him . I know that ’s kind of evil , and that I should n’t care , but I do . ”
68216	68221	68222	68222	Emmett	56	“ That ’s fine , ”
68226	68235	68222	68222	Emmett	56	“ You deserve recognition for what you did . ”
68236	68244	68245	68245	I	0	“ I do n’t need it though , ”
68248	68266	68245	68245	I	0	“ At this point , I ’m pretty sure I have everything I need to be happy , ”
68282	68291	68292	68292	he	56	“ I ’m pretty sure I do too , ”
68299	68308	68309	68309	he	56	“ Actually , I know that I do , ”
68313	68337	68338	68338	he	56	“ And I know that if you ever so much as think you ’re missing something , I ’ll find it for you , ”
68352	68365	68338	68338	he	56	“ Because I ’ve honestly only ever wanted you to be happy . ”
68474	68478	68479	68479	I	0	“ Good Lord , ”
68494	68497	68479	68479	I	0	“ What ? ”
68498	68518	68479	68479	I	0	“ Nothing . I ’m just still amazed by the perks that come with being Emmett Hoult ’s girlfriend . ”
68519	68525	68526	68526	he	56	“ Well , stick around , ”
68529	68537	68526	68526	he	56	“ You ai n’t seen nothing yet . ”
68675	68694	68695	68695	Emmett	56	“ Aly , Julian ’s called twice for some reason . Do you mind if I take it ? ”
68704	68709	68710	68710	I	0	“ Go for it , ”
68804	68816	68817	68817	My	0	“ Omigod – Aly Stanton ? Bitch , get over here ! ”
68858	68861	68862	68862	I	0	“ Drea ! ”
68882	68892	68862	68862	I	0	“ I have n’t seen you in so long ! ”
68893	68899	68900	68900	Drea	123	“ Three years I think ! ”
68926	68940	68941	68941	she	123	“ Oops – careful . They ’re expensive and I like my earlobes ! ”
68962	68986	68941	68941	she	123	“ Holy shit , lady . I do n’t even know how I recognized you with the long hair ! You look amazing ! ”
68987	69006	69007	69007	I	0	“ And you . I did n’t think you could get more glamorous but you proved me wrong ! ”
69063	69072	69045	69045	She	123	“ So what are you doing in Montauk ? ”
69073	69110	69111	69111	she	123	“ Oh , I ’m just here to visit some college friends , but I was thinking of you because I ’ve been reading such amazing things about your restaurant , and I am so proud ! ”
69126	69157	69111	69111	she	123	“ Psh , well , I could n’t have done it without you ! You showed me the ropes on how to do pretty much everything that I needed to – ”
69158	69161	69162	69162	Drea	123	“ Oh ! ”
69190	69193	69181	69181	Emmett	56	“ Oh . ”
69199	69204	69181	69181	Emmett	56	“ That ’s just – ”
69205	69208	69209	69209	Drea	123	“ Emmett ? ”
69229	69234	69226	69226	He	56	“ Shit . Drea . ”
69305	69315	69316	69316	she	123	“ I did n’t expect to see you here , ”
69319	69329	69316	69316	she	123	“ Me neither . What are you doing here ? ”
69343	69350	69354	69354	her	123	“ I … was just eating ? ”
69502	69515	69486	69486	Drea	123	“ It was so , so good to see you , Aly , ”
70229	70245	70246	70246	he	56	“ I know you ’re at work . I just wanted to hear your voice , ”
70357	70400	70401	70401	he	56	“ I ’m sorry , baby . The dinner with the gala speakers went long , and I was already on the Upper East Side , so I figured I ’d just see Mom and Gram and sleep here for the night , ”
70424	70437	70401	70401	he	56	“ Do you want me to call Julian to pick up Ozzy ? ”
70438	70443	70444	70444	I	0	“ No , silly , ”
70447	70472	70444	70444	I	0	“ I can take care of Ozzy . I ’ll wake up a little earlier in the morning so I can take him out . ”
70473	70488	70401	70401	he	56	“ Baby , no . You need every minute of sleep you can get . ”
70489	70519	70520	70520	He	56	“ Trust me – fifteen minutes wo n’t make a difference . And it ’ll be easier for me to get out of bed when you ’re not there . ”
70526	70538	70520	70520	He	56	“ I did n’t say that to make you feel bad , ”
70543	70565	70566	70566	he	56	“ I know . But it made me remember that I ’m going to be waking up alone in the morning , ”
70569	70580	70566	70566	he	56	“ And I ’ve kind of gotten spoiled with you . ”
70581	70592	70593	70593	I	0	“ Trust me . I ’m in the same boat , ”
70603	70609	70593	70593	I	0	“ But it ’s okay . ”
70610	70621	70622	70622	I	0	“ Alright . Well , I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
70633	70639	70640	70640	I	0	“ You have to go ? ”
70646	70660	70643	70643	He	56	“ Yeah . I think I ’m going to go to bed soon . ”
70675	70679	70680	70680	I	0	“ So early , ”
70683	70692	70680	70680	I	0	“ But you ’ve had a long day . ”
70693	70706	70707	70707	he	56	“ Yeah . I ’ll text you in the morning , okay ? ”
70710	70713	70707	70707	he	56	“ Okay . ”
70753	70760	70761	70761	he	56	“ I love you , baby , ”
70810	70817	70774	70774	he	56	“ I love you , too . ”
71446	71468	71469	71469	Evie	61	“ Poor Mike . He ’s going to be so sad when he realizes I stole the Milk & Cookies flavor , ”
71474	71499	71469	71469	Evie	61	“ But this is what he gets for eating my leftovers just because he forgot to buy himself frozen pizza . Oh my God . ”
71509	71539	71540	71540	I	0	“ Am I boring the shit out of you ? Because I think I just bored the shit out of me . Like , I actually felt it happen . ”
71543	71586	71540	71540	I	0	“ No , I ’d much rather listen to you than all the stupid , paranoid thoughts I ’m having , because they ’re telling me not to go to the gala tomorrow , and I already know that ’ll crush Emmett . ”
71587	71592	71593	71593	Evie	61	“ Damn . Really ? ”
71621	71631	71608	71608	Ozzy	71	“ Tomorrow means a lot to him , Aly … ”
71632	71666	71540	71540	I	0	“ I know . Which is why I do n’t want to let this paranoia push me into making a stupid decision . I ’m trying to talk myself through it right now . ”
71667	71676	71677	71677	she	61	“ Well , talk to me , girl , ”
71680	71729	71677	71677	she	61	“ ’Cause I ’ve been watching you randomly shudder and cringe to yourself all day and I know it ’s because you ’re bottling up whatever conspiracy theories you ’re cookin ’ up in that pretty head . So just spill . You know I do n’t judge . ”
71751	71762	71763	71763	Evie	61	“ Oh my God , this bed is so comfortable , ”
71792	71819	71780	71780	her	61	“ Okay . I ’m here . I ’m ready for discussion , and I know this is about Drea , so just get it out . ”
71820	71823	71824	71824	I	0	“ Fine , ”
71832	71883	71824	71824	I	0	“ I just … ca n’t help but feel weird about the fact that Emmett and I ran into her at dinner , there was clearly something weird between them , he would n’t talk to me about it , and then he went MIA for the next two days . ”
71884	71893	71894	71894	Evie	61	“ You think he ’s at her place ? ”
71897	71907	71894	71894	Evie	61	“ No . Maybe . I do n’t know . ”
71912	71976	71977	71977	Evie	61	“ In my heart , I do n’t believe it . But she does live in the city . They do have a history . And he did just see her . And if she ’s his one and only ex who inspired him to make his no - commitment rule , then there ’s clearly a lot of unfinished business between them . ”
71990	71998	71999	71999	she	61	“ Are you ready for my theory ? ”
72027	72120	72121	72121	Evie	61	“ I think that Emmett did not date Drea . But if they met and knew each other in college , that means it was during , you know , the darker times in his life . Maybe he was you know , King Frat Boy throwing some awesome party that she attended , and she walked in on him crying at some point ? Like , she saw him while he was weak and down , and he does n’t like that someone out there has seen that side of him ? ”
72134	72143	72125	72125	her	61	“ Nope . That sucks . Ignore it . ”
72144	72183	72184	72184	I	0	“ No , I ca n’t ignore it now , because that actually sounds like the reason why they would get together in the first place . Because his dad just died and he needed someone and aghhhh , ”
72203	72207	72208	72208	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
72216	72229	72230	72230	she	61	“ Okay , no more theories , but how ‘ bout this ? ”
72234	72328	72230	72230	she	61	“ Even if Emmett and Drea did date , he could very well be in the city for gala - only reasons , right ? You remember what it was like when we were first opening the restaurant and meeting with a million people every day – by just five o’clock we were pooped . And you said you heard his mom ’s voice in the background of your call yesterday , so he definitely did spend at least last night at her house , which counts for something . Does n’t it ? ”
72329	72332	72333	72333	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
72341	72358	72333	72333	I	0	“ And I do n’t know why , but I just … have faith in him . ”
72373	72383	72384	72384	I	0	“ I know we have n’t been dating long , ”
72388	72556	72384	72384	I	0	“ and I know I have n’t even known the adult version of Emmett Hoult for that long , but I believe everything he ’s told me about loving me . About me being his exception . He ’s just been so … quietly good to me for so many years . He let me ignore and blame him for more than a decade , and if he really wanted to , he could ’ve gone through my parents to track me down and clear his conscience by calling me out . But he just swallowed it and let me live my lie because he knew it made me feel better . But he still took me in when I needed a place to stay . He said yes to the whole platonic thing . He ’s been there for me through this whole psychological emancipation from my dad , and he ’s basically been the most incredible friend and boyfriend since we ’ve been living together , ”
72570	72604	72557	72557	I	0	“ And I ’m just so sold on his love that I ca n’t see the past two days as red flags . I just want to choose to have faith in him . ”
72622	72633	72613	72613	she	61	“ Fuck , that just made me want to cry . ”
72641	72646	72647	72647	I	0	“ You are crying , ”
72651	72658	72659	72659	she	61	“ I thought so . Balls , ”
72672	72675	72659	72659	she	61	“ Evie . ”
72698	72704	72682	72682	she	61	“ Oh no , bub . ”
72752	72760	72761	72761	I	0	“ Everything ’s going to be okay , ”
72781	72795	72796	72796	I	0	“ I know there are points where it does n’t seem like it , ”
72807	72819	72796	72796	I	0	“ But I promise everything ’s going to turn out fine . ”
73063	73067	73045	73046	a girl	352	“ I ’m fine ”
73071	73076	73045	73046	a girl	352	“ I ’m fine . ”
73109	73114	73122	73122	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
73314	73318	73319	73319	I	0	“ Everything okay ? ”
73325	73343	73344	73344	she	61	“ Yes . I think so . But … are you available to talk for a minute ? ”
73409	73416	73417	73417	I	0	“ Okay . I ’m here , ”
73420	73425	73417	73417	I	0	“ Talk to me . ”
73634	73658	73659	73659	Drew	72	“ E. You got ta stop doing that . I ca n’t be the only one getting anxious just from looking at you . ”
73682	73703	73668	73668	he	72	“ Just take it easy for a second , alright ? She ’s probably just doing her hair or something . ”
73704	73726	73727	73727	Drew	72	“ She knows this thing started an hour ago . And she does n’t take that long to do her hair . ”
73738	73755	73756	73756	he	72	“ Lipstick ? Shit , I do n’t know . Boss . Help me out here , ”
73769	73777	73778	73778	he	72	“ You looked like you needed it , ”
73789	73797	73778	73778	he	72	“ What ’s going on with him ? ”
73798	73808	73756	73756	he	72	“ He ’s worried the girl ’s not coming . ”
73809	73812	73813	73813	Julian	73	“ Aly ? ”
73817	73859	73813	73813	Julian	73	“ If she ’s here as your date , you should keep in mind that Mom is also here and if she catches onto what ’s happening , she ’s going to spend the night scheduling when you two start trying . ”
73860	73870	73871	73871	Drew	72	“ You told her about your wife being pregnant ? ”
73874	73878	73871	73871	Drew	72	“ I did . ”
73879	73883	73884	73884	Drew	72	“ She happy ? ”
73887	73894	73884	73884	Drew	72	“ She ’s over the moon , ”
73928	73939	73940	73940	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s the least of my worries , ”
73945	73968	73940	73940	I	0	“ Mom ’s free to find out that I ’m with Aly . Just as long as I ’m still with Aly . ”
73969	73976	74036	74036	him	73	“ What are you talking about ? ”
73977	74004	74005	74005	Drew	72	“ He thinks she ’s not coming tonight , even though she ’s probably just late . I mean what – you had a little fight ? ”
74008	74027	74005	74005	Drew	72	“ No . I mean maybe . I was just … away from the house for a bit , ”
74068	74089	74090	74090	Julian	73	“ Well , whatever that means , you need to breathe , Emmett . You have speeches to make tonight , ”
74094	74103	74104	74104	Drew	72	“ And you look like a fucking mess , ”
74112	74121	74122	74122	I	0	“ Thank you . You guys are great , ”
74217	74220	74221	74221	I	0	“ Emmett . ”
74232	74235	74226	74226	Britt	84	“ Hey . ”
74236	74239	74240	74240	She	84	“ Hi . ”
74265	74271	74257	74257	she	84	“ You alright , sweetie ? ”
74272	74279	74240	74240	She	84	“ Yeah . What ’s up ? ”
74280	74306	74307	74307	Britt	84	“ Well , we ’ve got Dr. Richards on deck in twenty , and the Kelley family will be standing beside him during the speech , ”
74310	74345	74346	74346	she	84	“ So wherever you are in about ten minutes , make sure I can find you because I need you onstage to introduce all five people . You have your notes ready , right ? ”
74365	74368	74369	74369	I	0	“ Yes , ”
74382	74389	74390	74390	Britt	84	“ I do . Sounds good . ”
74396	74422	74423	74423	she	84	“ You sure you alright , Emmett ? You seem anxious – despite the fact that you know I ’ve got you covered , babe , ”
74437	74456	74423	74423	she	84	“ Come on , Emmett . Have you ever had to worry when I ’m running your shit ? ”
74471	74474	74463	74463	I	0	“ No . ”
74475	74480	74481	74481	Britt	84	“ That ’s right , ”
74495	74504	74481	74481	Britt	84	“ Oop . Ca n’t do that now . ”
74505	74508	74463	74463	I	0	“ Why ? ”
74509	74525	74526	74526	she	84	“ Because no one needs to see me getting all hot and bothered right now , ”
74536	74562	74526	74526	she	84	“ Not the most professional look in the world . Even if it ’s common knowledge that you ’re the sexiest man in the room . ”
74585	74597	74578	74578	Britt	84	“ So … still have n’t gotten a hold of Aly ? ”
74598	74604	74610	74610	Britt	84	“ She ’s running late . ”
74605	74609	74610	74610	Britt	84	“ Very late , ”
74642	74653	74640	74640	Aly	61	“ I ’m going to step out to call her . ”
74654	74657	74658	74658	Britt	84	“ Babe . ”
74667	74704	74705	74705	she	84	“ You really do n’t have the time for that . You have to be on stage soon , so if you ’re not okay , we can take a minute somewhere and calm you down , ”
74715	74733	74734	74734	she	84	“ Whatever way you need to decompress , you know I ’m more than happy to help , ”
74741	74748	74734	74734	she	84	“ In whatever way you need . ”
74790	74796	74797	74797	Britt	84	“ What do you say ? ”
74871	74881	74882	74882	I	0	“ Thanks , Britt , but I ’m good , ”
74977	74991	74992	74992	Dev	136	“ You ’re used to Julian doing this part , are n’t you ? ”
74995	75007	74992	74992	Dev	136	“ Yeah , but he deserves a break this year since – ”
75040	75043	75037	75037	John	135	“ Whoa . ”
75132	75142	75159	75160	the guys	1166	“ Welp . There goes our chance , Dev . ”
75143	75154	75155	75155	I	0	“ Yep , we lost him . It ’s over . ”
75303	75323	75296	75296	she	61	“ Emmett , I had an emergency with Evie and Mike – I ’m so sorry I ’m late . ”
75324	75337	75338	75338	I	0	“ You ’re here now . That ’s all I care about , ”
75472	75475	75476	75476	she	61	“ Baby , ”
75483	75487	75476	75476	she	61	“ What happened ? ”
75567	75578	75579	75579	I	0	“ I do n’t … even know where to start , ”
75592	75618	75579	75579	I	0	“ But I promise I ’ll explain it soon . Not now , but tonight , when all this is over . Is that okay ? ”
75619	75623	75624	75624	Aly	61	“ Of course , ”
75648	75657	75658	75658	she	61	“ Emmett , everyone ’s staring at us , ”
75666	75669	75670	75670	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
75673	75676	75670	75670	I	0	“ Who ? ”
75677	75699	75638	75638	she	61	“ Everyone . Julian . Sara . Drew . Britt ’s looking at me like she wants to eat my head . ”
75700	75706	75663	75663	her	61	“ Yeah , ignore that . ”
75707	75727	75670	75670	I	0	“ Your mom though . And my parents – oh my God . My mom ’s face right now . ”
75728	75747	75748	75748	I	0	“ I take it now ’s not the time to ask for a kiss then , is it ? ”
75789	75821	75822	75822	Aly	61	“ Um , I feel like kissing now would be a big statement to everyone , which I ’m not sure you want to make at an event of this caliber , ”
75854	75864	75851	75851	she	61	“ You want it now , do n’t you ? ”
75865	75889	75890	75890	She	61	“ Yeah . I have to be on stage for awhile and I feel like I need the re - up on energy . ”
75903	75906	75907	75907	she	61	“ Fine , ”
75959	75966	75967	75967	I	0	“ Jesus . Was that Drew ? ”
75989	75997	75998	75998	Aly	61	“ Yeah . That was definitely Drew , ”
76012	76036	75998	75998	Aly	61	“ And now a very pissy Britt is coming to collect you for your speech , I think , so you should go . ”
76037	76040	76041	76041	I	0	“ Fine , ”
76050	76059	76041	76041	I	0	“ But I ’ll get you right after . ”
76060	76064	76065	76065	she	61	“ You better , ”
76079	76108	76065	76065	she	61	“ Because our parents are looking at me like they need an explanation STAT , and I ’m not having those talks with them all on my own . ”
76159	76172	76173	76173	she	57	“ Emmett , I feel like my heart is going to burst , ”
76203	76206	76198	76198	she	57	“ Mom ! ”
76217	76221	76222	76222	Mom	57	“ Happy tears ! ”
76236	76254	76222	76222	Mom	57	“ They ’re happy tears ! I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean to startle anyone . ”
76391	76403	76404	76404	Mom	57	“ Oh , Charlie ’s coming over with Donna and Aly , ”
76486	76504	76505	76505	Julian	73	“ It ’s supposed to be a surprise because she likes having the upper hand on me , ”
76554	76567	76568	76568	he	119	“ Well , you know you ca n’t have that , Julian , ”
76579	76598	76568	76568	he	119	“ It ’s got ta be the man with the upper hand . That ’s why it rhymes . ”
76651	76669	76670	76670	Aly	61	“ Anyway , can we please talk about the fact that you won my daughter ’s heart ? ”
76681	76696	76670	76670	Aly	61	“ From what I recall , you two defined the word rivalry growing up . ”
76697	76704	76705	76705	Charlie	119	“ Rivalry implies there was competition , ”
76712	76725	76705	76705	Charlie	119	“ And I do n’t think it was ever a close race . ”
76783	76792	76801	76801	he	119	“ I did n’t mean anything by it ! ”
76811	76816	76801	76801	he	119	“ ruining a good time ”
76818	76823	76801	76801	he	119	“ getting all serious . ”
76847	76857	76858	76858	I	0	“ What do you mean by that , Charlie ? ”
76894	76911	76878	76878	he	119	“ What do you mean what do I mean about it ? It was a joke . ”
76912	76945	76946	76946	I	0	“ Well , can you explain it ? Because ‘ it was a joke ’ seems to be your fallback line when you know you ca n’t back up something you said , ”
77020	77048	77049	77049	Sara	74	“ Argh , my friends have all been ! But I have n’t yet because Julian keeps waiting for a day when we can go with Emmett , ”
77052	77066	77067	77067	She	74	“ But I have seriously been craving a lobster roll like no other . ”
77077	77089	77067	77067	She	74	“ I think baby ’s got fancy taste . Like Daddy . ”
77090	77098	77099	77099	Julian	73	“ Pretty sure that ’s all you , ”
77117	77160	77161	77161	she	57	“ You know what I want ? I ’m trying to find the picture of that Bloody Mary you have , Aly . I saw it on this food website , and I took a screenshot , but where did it go ? ”
77171	77185	77161	77161	she	57	“ The Hail Mary – that ’s what you ’re famous for right ? ”
77186	77198	77199	77199	Aly	61	“ Well , it ’s definitely that and the lobster roll , ”
77202	77211	77199	77199	Aly	61	“ They ’re definitely the two most popular – ”
77212	77219	77220	77220	Charlie	119	“ Thank Emmett for that one , ”
77223	77234	77235	77235	he	119	“ You said he saved her liquor license , right ? ”
77245	77262	77243	77243	Aly	61	“ Well , thank God for that , or you would ’ve lost all your business . ”
77266	77269	77270	77270	Julian	73	“ Easy , ”
77277	77287	77288	77288	Aly	66	“ We ’ve been out of the drink before , ”
77291	77297	77288	77288	Aly	66	“ And we still survived . ”
77298	77323	77288	77288	Aly	66	“ Yeah , for one day , sure . But the whole summer ? Kiss that restaurant goodbye . Just like I told ya . ”
77351	77406	77407	77407	she	66	“ Dad , we all know you though the restaurant was a bad idea , but it ’s been kicking ass this whole summer , and it ’s the food , not the liquor sales that have been driving so much business back to the warehouse . So lay off a bit , huh ? ”
77410	77419	77407	77407	she	66	“ ‘ Cause ya seem a little jealous . ”
77480	77484	77485	77485	Charlie	119	“ ball busting , ”
77814	77817	77804	77804	Charlie	119	“ Leaving ? ”
77825	77831	77832	77832	He	119	“ Should I get Donna ? ”
77863	77874	77875	77875	he	119	“ Hey , I thought of a funny joke before , ”
77878	77881	77875	77875	he	119	“ What ? ”
77882	77904	77905	77905	I	0	“ You know how this is a fundraiser ? I thought well , you ’re being very charitable by dating Aly . ”
77922	77944	77905	77905	I	0	“ I would n’t say that . I can promise you she ’s not the lucky one , it ’s me . ”
77945	77966	77967	77967	Charlie	119	“ Jesus , Emmett . You ’re not gon na ask me for her hand in marriage , are you ? ”
77970	77994	77995	77995	He	119	“ Because you might want to think on that . You could be dating any one of these pretty girls here next week . ”
78004	78040	77995	77995	He	119	“ That one . That one . Blonde one . Tall one . Not everyone can be Emmett Hoult so do n’t ask me something crazy right now . I do n’t wanna hear it . ”
78041	78052	78053	78053	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m not asking you for that , ”
78071	78141	78067	78067	I	0	“ I do n’t need your permission for whenever I decide to propose . I ’m going to eventually , and when I want to , I will . I just thought I should say now that if you ca n’t get past that famous ego of yours and treat Aly with the respect she deserves , then you wo n’t have a role in any of our lives , ”
78174	78222	78223	78223	I	0	“ She bailed you out , Charlie . She did everything you could n’t do with that company , and if you ’re hell - bent on pretending that never happened , then out of respect for my father , I ’ll say goodbye to you here , ”
78255	78268	78269	78269	he	119	“ You ’re not gon na wind up marrying her , Emmett , ”
78384	78397	78398	78398	I	0	“ They do n’t trust you . You look way too tired , ”
78440	78443	78444	78444	he	56	“ Baby , ”
78470	78473	78459	78459	he	56	“ Exhausted ? ”
78474	78477	78478	78478	he	56	“ Yes , ”
78489	78495	78481	78481	I	0	“ Ready to go home ? ”
78496	78525	78459	78459	he	56	“ Yes . But I have to wait for John and Dev to finish something . If you ’re tired though I ’ll call you a car first . ”
78526	78536	78537	78537	I	0	“ No , I ’d rather wait for you , ”
78552	78563	78564	78564	I	0	“ I could use a couple explanations from you anyway , ”
78578	78585	78564	78564	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Emmett . ”
78602	78617	78595	78595	his	56	“ I just need to know . Where were you the past two days ? ”
78632	78638	78624	78624	I	0	“ Were you with Drea ? ”
78639	78642	78643	78643	He	56	“ Huh ? ”
78650	78660	78643	78643	He	56	“ No . Why would I be with Drea ? ”
78661	78665	78666	78666	I	0	“ I thought … ”
78699	78711	78712	78712	Emmett	56	“ Aly , I promise you I ’ve never dated Drea , ”
78715	78756	78712	78712	Emmett	56	“ I ’ve only ever had one ex and it was a girl from college named Kristy . I do n’t even remember if it was spelled with a K or a C anymore , it was that long ago . ”
78780	78810	78811	78811	I	0	“ I thought you said that everything was great about you two . I mean when you ended , you were heartbroken enough to vow to never commit again , ”
78828	78835	78836	78836	I	0	“ Did I interpret that wrong ? ”
78839	78844	78845	78845	he	56	“ I think yes , ”
78849	78858	78845	78845	he	56	“ Then why did you stop dating her ? ”
78870	78900	78863	78863	he	56	“ Because my mom was going through another break . And I had to be there for her to make sure she did n’t try to hurt herself again . ”
78913	78922	78906	78906	I	0	“ Hurt herself ? What do you mean – ”
78923	78938	78939	78939	Emmett	56	“ After Dad died , and after Julian moved away ... things were bad . ”
78949	79002	78941	78941	his	56	“ And one morning … it was probably 6AM when Gram called me crying so hysterically I started driving right over in my pajamas because I could n’t get words out of her . I had no idea what she was saying and at some point , she just dropped the phone . ”
79008	79012	78941	78941	his	56	“ What happened ? ”
79013	79021	79022	79022	My	0	“ My mom tried to kill herself . ”
79029	79032	79022	79022	My	0	“ What ? ”
79033	79039	79040	79040	Emmett	56	“ Julian does n’t know , ”
79050	79056	79040	79040	Emmett	56	“ And he ca n’t . ”
79057	79062	79022	79022	My	0	“ What – why ? ”
79063	79070	79078	79078	his	56	“ Because he ’ll blame himself , ”
79081	79167	79078	79078	his	56	“ He already blamed himself for Dad and he still does to this day . He ’s gotten way better since meeting Sara , and she ’s made a world of difference in the way he handles this part of his life , but I do n’t want to risk the bad times coming back . He already wo n’t forgive himself for being gone for so long – he definitely does n’t need to know exactly how bad things were when he was away . ”
79168	79188	79281	79281	I	0	“ So he … never even knew your mom did this ? You never called him when it happened ? ”
79189	79212	79213	79213	Emmett	56	“ She would n’t let me . And Gram told me we should just do what we could to keep her calm , ”
79216	79249	79213	79213	Emmett	56	“ And I was eighteen when this happened – I did n’t know how to handle something like this . I know I made mistakes but I was learning along the way . ”
79250	79255	79256	79256	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
79275	79280	79264	79264	I	0	“ You were eighteen , ”
79290	79318	79264	79264	I	0	“ But … wait . I do n’t understand how you drove over so fast . You were in college at this point and your mom was – ”
79319	79355	79281	79281	I	0	“ She still had the Upper East Side townhouse , but pretty much right after Julian left , she moved to be near me . She and Gram rented this little apartment near my campus . ”
79356	79360	79264	79264	I	0	“ In Philly ? ”
79361	79364	79264	79264	I	0	“ Yes . ”
79445	79525	79526	79526	Emmett	56	“ She did n’t tell anyone , obviously . She felt guilty and ashamed that she needed her son to take care of her . She said that was supposed to be her job , so I should n’t have to be cleaning for her and checking on her . But I had to . Gram was n’t doing the best at the time either , and if I did n’t cook for Mom , she would n’t eat , ”
79596	79605	79606	79606	Emmett	56	“ I know . It ’s a lot , ”
79873	79884	79885	79885	he	56	“ It ’s hard to hear all this out loud , ”
79888	79895	79885	79885	he	56	“ Even from my own voice . ”
79896	79903	79904	79904	I	0	“ I know what you mean . ”
79915	79944	79904	79904	I	0	“ It makes you think about all the things you should ’ve done instead . Or ways you could ’ve made this easier on yourself at some point . ”
79945	79948	79949	79949	Emmett	56	“ Definitely , ”
79952	80004	79949	79949	Emmett	56	“ I know I should ’ve told Julian at some point . But half the reason she fell into that place was because of him , and even after he came back for good , I did n’t know how to say so many years ’ worth of shit to him . ”
80005	80027	79904	79904	I	0	“ So when she has these breaks now … you do n’t let him know even a little what ’s happening ? ”
80028	80072	79904	79904	I	0	“ No . There ’s no point in upsetting him when I ’m the only one who can help . I ’ve been there since the beginning . I know all her ticks and patterns . All the tricks to calm her down . ”
80073	80082	79949	79949	Emmett	56	“ How often does she have these breaks ? ”
80083	80141	79904	79904	I	0	“ Not as often now . They ’ve been less and less frequent over the years . But in the beginning , there were times when I ’d be living with her and Gram for weeks , maybe a month at a time because that was how long it took to pull her out of these places . ”
80142	80167	79949	79949	Emmett	56	“ So you did n’t do relationships because you felt like … you were on call for her ? In case she broke down ? ”
80168	80171	80172	80172	Emmett	56	“ Yeah . ”
80192	80201	80202	80202	I	0	“ But … what if you ’re away ? ”
80217	80236	80237	80237	Emmett	56	“ I do n’t go away for too long . Never more than a week at a time , ”
80240	80300	80237	80237	Emmett	56	“ I know if something were to happen and she fell into one of these places , she would n’t tell me if I were on vacation . She ’d want me to enjoy myself . But that ’s not worth it because when I catch her early enough , I can talk her down before things gets bad . ”
80301	80304	80305	80305	I	0	“ Right , ”
80350	80362	80363	80363	I	0	“ So that ’s where you were the past two days , ”
80369	80374	80363	80363	I	0	“ What triggered it ? ”
80375	80378	80379	80379	he	56	“ Sara , ”
80391	80399	80384	80384	he	56	“ Well not Sara . Her pregnancy . ”
80405	80414	80384	80384	he	56	“ Your mom is n’t happy about it ? ”
80415	80431	80432	80432	Emmett	56	“ Oh , she ’s ecstatic . Julian said she cried for an hour straight , ”
80440	80521	80522	80522	he	56	“ But I think … there ’s a fine line between her being really happy and really sad . I think a lot of times when she ’s over the moon about something , she misses my dad . And with Sara being pregnant , I know she ’s just wishing more than ever for him to be here . We were all torn apart the day he died but look at us now . We ’re rolling deep again , ”
80531	80544	80522	80522	he	56	“ We ’ve got Sara now . We got a baby coming . ”
80549	80560	80561	80561	he	56	“ I ’ve got pretty good prospects in my life , ”
80583	80610	80578	80578	he	56	“ It ’s everything Dad wanted . And I know Mom ’s just hurting about the fact that he ca n’t be here to see it . ”
80611	80615	80616	80616	I	0	“ Of course , ”
80688	80699	80700	80700	I	0	“ I wish I could ’ve been there for you , ”
80708	80753	80700	80700	I	0	“ I know things were weird between us , but I ’ve always felt like you were my family . I know it ’s hard to believe , but I do n’t think I would have let you go through something like this alone . ”
80754	80762	80763	80763	Emmett	56	“ I know you would n’t have . ”
80769	80784	80763	80763	Emmett	56	“ You understood me and my family more than anyone else in the world . ”
80785	80795	80796	80796	I	0	“ So I should ’ve been there for you , ”
80827	80833	80834	80834	he	56	“ You ’re here now , ”
80837	80845	80834	80834	he	56	“ And that ’s all that matters . ”
81301	81304	81305	81305	He	56	“ Mmph . ”
81332	81350	81351	81351	He	56	“ I ’m trying to sleep , baby , what are you – ah … holy fuck . ”
81572	81579	81580	81580	I	0	“ Oh my God , Emmett , ”
81673	81680	81681	81681	Emmett	56	“ Tell me you want it , ”
81689	81699	81681	81681	Emmett	56	“ Tell me you want my cum inside you . ”
81700	81714	81715	81715	I	0	“ Give it to me , Emmett . I want to feel it , ”
82156	82160	82161	82161	I	0	“ Oh shit ! ”
82170	82173	82174	82174	I	0	“ Crap ! ”
82398	82406	82409	82409	Emmett	56	“ Should I call the fire department ? ”
82520	82528	82515	82515	he	56	“ What are you doing , Aly ? ”
82529	82541	82542	82542	He	56	“ I was looking for something to wave at the alarm . ”
82548	82554	82555	82555	he	56	“ What did you find ? ”
82588	82596	82585	82585	him	56	“ How do you know this company ? ”
82614	82634	82605	82605	I	0	“ This is the company that invested in me three years ago . So I could open my restaurant . ”
82761	82774	82775	82775	I	0	“ Were you the one who invested in my company , Emmett ? ”
82789	82805	82806	82806	I	0	“ I ’m not trying to fight , I just need you to answer me , ”
82822	82825	82806	82806	I	0	“ Yes . ”
82982	82992	82976	82976	I	0	“ You never told me how you knew her . ”
82993	82996	83046	83046	he	56	“ Who ? ”
82997	83000	83001	83001	My	0	“ Drea . ”
83011	83030	83001	83001	My	0	“ So I need you to tell me now , Emmett . Tell me how you know Drea . ”
83031	83037	83038	83038	he	56	“ We ’re work acquaintances , ”
83050	83072	83046	83046	he	56	“ I ’m an investor with The Victorian . Her restaurant group manages the bar at the top of that hotel . ”
83073	83081	83046	83046	he	56	“ How long have you known her ? ”
83082	83086	83087	83087	His	56	“ Five years . ”
83116	83131	83132	83132	I	0	“ Were you the reason I got hired at Vandermark Restaurants four years ago ? ”
83139	83142	83132	83132	I	0	“ Yes . ”
83162	83165	83143	83143	I	0	“ Aly . ”
83176	83188	83189	83189	he	56	“ I did n’t think I ’d see you ever again , ”
83201	83272	83273	83273	he	56	“ I tried reaching out so many times , but you did n’t answer . You know I did n’t regret what I did , but I hated everything that happened after . I hated that your dad sent you away . I knew from your mom that you felt lost for so many years after , and I felt like I took so much of your life from you , ”
83393	83408	83409	83409	I	0	“ Emmett , why ? Why did you feel the need to do this ? ”
83448	83560	83438	83438	I	0	“ Because I wanted to fix things . I wanted to make up for all the pain I caused you . I knew you were still hurting from what happened , and I knew from both your mom and mine what you were up to here and there . I always kept an ear out for what you were doing because I wanted to know that whatever it was , you were happy . And that you ’d moved on okay . When my mom told me you were having trouble getting hired , I asked where , she said Vandermark , and I made one call – that was it . ”
83561	83576	83577	83577	I	0	“ It ’s not as simple as you ’re making it out to be , ”
83581	83608	83577	83577	I	0	“ I thought these were all things that happened organically . I thought I had made these things happen . I thought Drea was my friend . ”
83609	83615	83616	83616	Emmett	56	“ She is your friend , ”
83619	83668	83616	83616	Emmett	56	“ A company like that is n’t going to hold onto an employee who is n’t working out for them . They ’re too big and impatient for that , so when I say I only made a call , I promise you that ’s all I did . ”
83669	83682	83577	83577	I	0	“ You knew from Drea that I wanted to open a restaurant . ”
83683	83696	83577	83577	I	0	“ I could ’ve found out just as easily from my mom . ”
83697	83711	83712	83712	I	0	“ You did n’t have to be the one to invest in me , ”
83715	83733	83734	83734	Emmett	56	“ No , I did n’t , but I wanted you to have everything you needed faster , ”
83737	83755	83734	83734	Emmett	56	“ I wanted to make your life easy for once . So you could just be happy . ”
83774	83780	83766	83766	I	0	“ Who knows about this ? ”
83781	83789	83790	83790	Emmett	56	“ No one but my business partner , ”
83794	83813	83790	83790	Emmett	56	“ Julian does n’t know . My mom definitely does n’t . Your dad will never find out . ”
83895	83900	83887	83887	I	0	“ Aly , please . ”
83901	83913	83914	83914	I	0	“ I know this came from a good place , Emmett . ”
83924	83934	83914	83914	I	0	“ I know you did this because you cared . ”

84450	84460	84411	84413	the commentators onscreen	1297	“ Well , he should ’ve controlled his temper . ”
84461	84469	84411	84413	the commentators onscreen	1297	“ You ’re not wrong about that . ”
84470	84477	84411	84413	the commentators onscreen	1297	“ Shoulda , woulda , coulda … ”

84616	84635	84610	84610	I	0	“ Jesus , dude . You ’re starting to scare me . It ’s like you ’re catatonic . ”
84636	84650	84592	84592	he	72	“ I met you here , what else do you want from me ? ”
84651	84674	84675	84675	He	72	“ I want you to look alive , motherfucker ! Throw something ! Be pissed with me ! Come on , man ! ”
84683	84699	84675	84675	He	72	“ What do I have to do to get you to be a person again ? ”
84700	84706	84707	84707	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
84811	84818	84807	84807	she	61	“ I just need some time . ”
84868	84888	84889	84889	she	61	“ It ’s not right to make Aly dread coming to work every day for fear of seeing you , ”
85342	85346	85347	85347	Drew	72	“ Tough love , ”
85355	85362	85347	85347	Drew	72	“ What the fuck , dude ? ”
85374	85389	85363	85363	I	0	“ What ? I had to make sure you were n’t texting the girl . ”
85390	85397	85347	85347	Drew	72	“ I ’m not texting her . ”
85398	85442	85443	85443	I	0	“ Good . You should n’t . ‘ Cause if she does n’t want you at your best , then she does n’t deserve you at your – wait . I do n’t know how that expression goes . What is it again ? ”

85508	85556	85492	85492	He	72	“ I ’m trying to say what people say when someone gets dumped , but I do n’t even know why you two broke up , so I ’m just … saying shit , who knows . Leave me alone . I got ejected from the game . ”
85620	85623	85624	85624	Drew	72	“ Hey , ”
85629	85638	85624	85624	Drew	72	“ You should come out with me tonight . ”
85639	85646	85583	85583	him	72	“ I do n’t think so . ”
85647	85669	85624	85624	Drew	72	“ My ass . You ca n’t keep saying no when I invite you out . It ’s for your health . ”
85670	85673	85624	85624	Drew	72	“ Really . ”
85674	85698	85583	85583	him	72	“ Yes . You ca n’t sulk over a girl for the rest of your life . That ’s gon na kill you . ”
85699	85721	85722	85722	I	0	“ It ’s been two weeks . I think it ’s pretty fair if I take a little longer than that , ”
85725	85753	85754	85754	he	72	“ I do n’t expect you to fall in love again . I ’m just telling you to get laid . It ’s good for the soul , ”
85771	85777	85778	85778	Drew	72	“ Yes ! Hell yes ! ”
85805	85838	85802	85802	I	0	“ That , my brother , was a sign . That three - run fucking homer was a sign that you need to come out tonight . End of story . Period . ”
85839	85842	85778	85778	Drew	72	“ Yeah ? ”
85843	85877	85802	85802	I	0	“ Yeah ! That Instagram girl I ’m seeing – she ’s got a sister you might be interested in . A sister or a friend . It ’s one or the other . ”
85878	85888	85802	85802	I	0	“ Do you even know this girl ’s name ? ”
85889	85892	85778	85778	Drew	72	“ Yeah . ”
85893	85898	85802	85802	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
85899	85902	85802	85802	I	0	“ Babe . ”
85903	85917	85918	85918	I	0	“ That ’s what you call her . That ’s not her name , ”
85921	85934	85918	85918	I	0	“ Well , it still works , so what ’s the difference ? ”
85973	85986	85987	85987	he	72	“ Awesome . She just sent me a picture of her sister , ”
85993	86009	85987	85987	he	72	“ What ? Why would you ask her to send you a picture of her – ”
86025	86040	86041	86041	I	0	“ Awesome . Very cute . Now get your phone out of my face , ”
86061	86067	86057	86057	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
86068	86079	86080	86080	Drew	72	“ I told her you think her sister is awesome , ”
86092	86117	86083	86083	he	72	“ And she said she ’s excited to meet you , so get excited , asshole . ‘ Cause we ’re going out tonight . ”
86351	86378	86379	86379	she	61	“ Please . Please stay over my house tonight . Mike said yes . I talked to him about it all night yesterday , so please , ”
86395	86416	86379	86379	she	61	“ You ca n’t operate on two hours of sleep for the next month - and - a - half . ”
86417	86430	86344	86344	Evie	61	“ I did it before I wound up moving into his house . ”
86431	86470	86379	86379	she	61	“ Yeah , but you only had one job then . Two jobs with only two hours of sleep a night is different , and that difference is you collapsing one day in the middle of this kitchen . ”
86471	86491	86379	86379	she	61	“ Evie . It ’s really not that bad . The job is easy and the motel is nice . ”
86492	86510	86379	86379	she	61	“ Then why have n’t you told me where you work or invited me to the motel ? ”
86511	86514	86515	86515	I	0	“ Because , ”
86556	86580	86581	86581	she	61	“ Well , since you do n’t work your sketchy second job tonight , will you at least come over to hang out ? ”
86584	86608	86609	86609	I	0	“ If I do , are you going to slash the tires to my car while I ’m in the bathroom or something ? ”
86612	86617	86609	86609	I	0	“ Dude , no . ”
86623	86641	86620	86620	her	61	“ I ’d obviously get Mike to use the tire jack so he could remove them properly . ”
86642	86645	86620	86620	her	61	“ Haaa . ”
86646	86666	86667	86667	I	0	“ I would n’t want you to have to replace them ! Do you know how much tires cost ? ”
86947	86949	86940	86940	Evie	61	“ suite ”
87063	87067	87059	87059	him	62	“ this tiny apartment ”
87095	87101	87102	87102	she	61	“ You ’re so stupid , ”
87137	87168	87169	87169	she	61	“ He said it ’s totally cool that you stay , and if you do n’t believe me , he even offered us his pint of Ben and Jerry ’s , ”
87185	87188	87169	87169	she	61	“ Mike ! ”
87189	87192	87169	87169	she	61	“ What ? ”
87193	87205	87169	87169	she	61	“ Tell Aly you said we could have your ice cream ! ”
87206	87219	87169	87169	she	61	“ I said you guys could have my ice cream ! Enjoy ! ”
87220	87223	87224	87224	Evie	61	“ See ? ”
87268	87283	87284	87284	Evie	61	“ I really think we might be better now . After the last fight , ”
87404	87418	87419	87419	Evie	61	“ Do you mind that I told Mike that Emmett was our investor ? ”
87435	87446	87447	87447	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I think I do , ”
87451	87502	87503	87503	I	0	“ But mostly because I ’m paranoid that the wrong people will find out that Emmett Hoult funded my career . I know you had to tell him . He ’s your fiancé and I know he wo n’t like , randomly call up my dad and spill the beans , ”
87529	87548	87549	87549	I	0	“ For what it ’s worth , he thinks Emmett was just trying to be a good guy . ”
87558	87587	87588	87588	I	0	“ I know . But it does n’t change the fact that I ’ll never be able to look at my own achievements without having to credit him , ”
87591	87603	87588	87588	I	0	“ And I just want something of my own for once . ”
87604	87637	87638	87638	Evie	61	“ Well , if it makes you feel better , Emmett Hoult is also my investor , and I do n’t feel any less proud of myself for what I ’ve achieved , ”
87653	87732	87638	87638	Evie	61	“ Granted I do n’t have the same history you have with him , but if you can somehow forget that for a second and pretend he ’s just some faceless investor like we initially thought , we did do a shit ton of work on our own . Having money does n’t mean you can just make a business happen . You have to have a good idea and you have to know how to use it . ”
87733	87738	87739	87739	I	0	“ Uh - huh , ”
87742	87759	87739	87739	I	0	“ He also had Drea van Dahl hire me when I did n’t necessarily deserve it . ”
87760	87789	87790	87790	Evie	61	“ So what ? It ’s like ... weird nepotism . He was basically giving you a taste of all the privilege he himself has had in life , ”
87793	87844	87790	87790	Evie	61	“ He missed you , Aly . He could n’t take care of you in person , so he tried to do it from afar . That ’s what people are supposed to do when they love you . They do whatever they can to make sure you ’re okay . ”
87845	87856	87857	87857	I	0	“ Well , he did n’t love me yet then , ”
87861	87911	87857	87857	I	0	“ This was four years ago that he got involved in my life . I think he probably just had too much time and money on his hands , he heard I was having trouble , and he just dunked some money in me to relieve his own conscience . ”
87912	87927	87790	87790	Evie	61	“ Holy crap , you are cynical . Can I get you more wine ? ”
87928	87947	87857	87857	I	0	“ No , Evie . We have work in seven hours and we ca n’t be hung over . ”
87948	87982	87857	87857	I	0	“ Then will you please just look at this video of a dog cradling a baby ? My mom just posted it on my wall and it ’s making my ovaries do things . ”
87983	87986	87987	87987	I	0	“ Fine , ”
88284	88289	88290	88291	Timmy Whitman	149	“ Oh my God . ”
88357	88362	88363	88363	I	0	“ This is crazy , ”
88720	88734	88735	88735	she	61	“ I ’m guessing your other job does n’t require a steady hand ? ”
88749	88775	88776	88776	I	0	“ Oh , it totally does , but it ’s more important for me to be awake there than it is for me to steady , ”
89055	89060	89053	89053	he	72	“ three buddies in tow ”
89153	89156	89147	89147	Hannah	93	“ Aly ? ”
89162	89165	89147	89147	Hannah	93	“ Yes ? ”
89166	89194	89195	89195	I	0	“ There ’s a lady at the raw bar who asked if you were working today – she said she ’s an old friend from high school ? ”
89200	89203	89195	89195	I	0	“ What ? ”
89204	89208	89147	89147	Hannah	93	“ She said – ”
89209	89228	89229	89229	I	0	“ Sorry ! You do n’t have to keep talking through the door , I ’m coming out ! ”
89249	89256	89258	89258	she	93	“ Breathe . She seems nice , ”
89296	89299	89300	89300	I	0	“ Kelsey ? ”
89318	89327	89328	89328	she	93	“ Holy shit ! You look so different ! ”
89340	89345	89328	89328	she	93	“ You do too ! ”
89405	89421	89422	89422	Kelsey	155	“ Well , I saw you back on Facebook for the first time in forever ! ”
89440	89449	89422	89422	Kelsey	155	“ You liked a picture of my cat ! ”
89450	89454	89422	89422	Kelsey	155	“ I did ? ”
89455	89482	89483	89483	she	155	“ Yeah ! But maybe you did n’t realize it was me ? I changed my name to initials so my employers ca n’t find me , ”
89486	89561	89483	89483	she	155	“ But yeah , I saw that notification and was like , ‘ whoa . Blast from the past . ’ And your profile did n’t have any new info on it so I may or may not have Googled you and found a bunch of articles about this place – which is amazing by the way . Holy shit , woman ! What ’s this about the lobster roll and the Blood Mary ? ”
89562	89584	89585	89585	Evie	61	“ The Hail Mary , and I ’m going to make you one now – you ’re gon na love it , ”
89608	89635	89636	89636	she	155	“ Holy crap . This is strong . It ’s a good thing you include a meal with it so I do n’t get immediately shitfaced , ”
89658	89665	89666	89666	Evie	61	“ But do you like it ? ”
89669	89684	89666	89666	Evie	61	“ Oh , I ’m definitely gon na need another one in two minutes . ”
89696	89701	89702	89702	she	61	“ I like her , ”
89816	89842	89843	89843	she	155	“ I actually cut out some friends by senior year because of how shitty they were about the thing with you and … that asshole , ”
89857	89868	89853	89853	she	155	“ Sorry . Should I not be talking about that ? ”
89869	89873	89874	89874	I	0	“ Mr. Scott ? ”
89877	89895	89896	89896	I	0	“ Oh , I do n’t care . He ’s not really a big deal to me , ”
89942	89953	89954	89954	she	155	“ Should I get going ? You guys are busy , ”
89958	89970	89954	89954	she	155	“ Oh God , stop . No . You ’re fine , ”
89975	89995	89954	89954	she	155	“ If I look out of it , it ’s because I did n’t get much sleep last night . ”
89996	90008	90009	90009	she	155	“ Well , yeah , you were trolling Facebook at 2AM , ”
90023	90056	90057	90057	She	155	“ Though in your defense , if I reactivated my Facebook after more than ten years away , I ’d have stayed up the whole night stalking the shit out of people . ”
90066	90076	90057	90057	She	155	“ I mean I still do that , actually . ”
90077	90080	90081	90081	Evie	61	“ Really ? ”
90084	90105	90081	90081	Evie	61	“ Me too . I still stalk like , people I hooked up with once when I was a sophomore . ”
90106	90122	90123	90123	Kelsey	155	“ Same . Though the hook - up I still stalk happened my junior year … ”
90138	90173	90129	90129	she	155	“ Am I allowed to talk about Emmett Hoult , or no ? Because I did run into him a few years ago … and we may or may not have talked about you . ”
90186	90193	90194	90194	she	155	“ Oh my God – spill ! ”
90210	90237	90238	90238	she	155	“ First things first , can I just say that I ’m sorry I hooked up with him back then when you told me not to ? ”
90246	90282	90238	90238	she	155	“ I mean I ’d literally watched a bunch of our friends lose their minds after hooking up with him once and never getting to talk to him again , and I still did it . ”
90283	90291	90292	90292	I	0	“ I mean who could blame you ? ”
90305	90319	90292	90292	I	0	“ He was gorgeous . He was the one all the girls wanted . ”
90320	90362	90363	90363	Kelsey	155	“ True . Though I do n’t think I ever told you the drunken shit he said to me the night we hooked up . I was too heartbroken that he was ignoring me , just like I knew he would , ”
90372	90378	90379	90379	Evie	61	“ What ’d he say ? ”
90394	90448	90379	90379	Evie	61	“ Well , we were in Greg Barton ’s bedroom , and Emmett was all drunk and just laughing and groaning and hesitating to kiss me . He kept saying , ‘ This one might really fuck up my chances in the future , ‘ cause you ’re her actual best friend . ’ ”
90459	90462	90463	90463	Kelsey	155	“ Yeah , ”
90478	90494	90495	90495	she	61	“ Well , fuck me ! That means he was always in love with Aly ! ”
90504	90548	90549	90549	she	61	“ I mean I think so . Pretty sure everything he did back then was to get your attention , Aly . He just did n’t know what he was feeling because teenage boys are stupid . Almost as stupid as teenage girls , ”
90558	90622	90623	90623	she	61	“ Anyway , less juicy story – I ran into him a few years ago and asked if he ’d seen you because you were n’t on Facebook anymore and you have like , no social media . And he said he had n’t , but he heard you were doing good and that was all that mattered to him . The end , ”
90868	90876	90865	90865	she	1701	“ yea we both know she ’s lying ”

91529	91553	91602	91602	Julian	73	“ I ’m at the stadium . I just had a front office meeting with Drew Maddox about his future with the team . ”

91563	91601	91602	91602	Julian	73	“ Because he spent the last ten minutes trying to convince me to let him into your apartment so he could ensure you were n’t dead . Apparently he ’s been calling you for a week now , ”
91613	91621	91602	91602	Julian	73	“ And you have n’t picked up . ”

91755	91784	91752	91752	Julian	73	“ I ca n’t explain it but you of all people know that Drew can turn a normal situation into a crazy one in about two seconds flat . ”
91785	91811	91752	91752	Julian	73	“ I believe you . But you might want to enjoy the time you have left with him , because he might be traded soon . ”
91812	91815	91816	91816	I	0	“ What ? ”
91824	91830	91821	91821	Ozzy	71	“ Do n’t tell him . ”

91837	91891	91892	91892	Julian	73	“ Trust me , I ’m against it . He ’s a pain in the ass , but he ’s going to go down as one of the best in the game , so know that I ’m in his corner . I ’m just letting you know that there have been discussions , ”
91907	91935	91901	91901	he	73	“ On the bright side , he said he ’s been trying to get you to ‘ look alive ’ and you certainly sound it right now . ”

I know it feels like I stole all your achievements from the past three , four years – but you need to know that you did all this on your own . If it were n’t me , it would ’ve been someone else investing in you because you ’re fucking brilliant . You ’re smart and you ’re passionate , and before I found my business partner , I promise you I invested in more than a dozen restaurants that closed before a year because they did n’t have your drive . The money does n’t matter , it ’s the love that does . So fine , maybe I took interest in your company because of you , but Iain did it because he knew you were a smart and unique and – ”

96145	96393	96394	96394	You	1496	” I scrunched up my face as I freed myself from my blazer . Yeah , no . Not so much . If lucky meant nine years of chasing nonexistent promotions , being tricked into working thousands of overtime hours without the pay , getting thrown under the bus for anything the higher - ups did wrong , and spending the past three months on a piece that my editor had no intention of crediting me for – a fun fact I ’d discovered just today – then sure , I was lucky . So lucky that I wound up permanently deleting all history of my research , contacts and writing , leaving the office in a blaze of glory that set my bosses back three months of hard work . So … bridges ? All burned . There was definitely no going back . And while it was exhilarating now , I knew that by morning , once reality set in , I ’d be horrified . I ’d worked with the company since I was eighteen . My office - centric life was all I knew . Being overworked was all I knew . In fact , I had no clue what to do with my time if I was n’t strapped to a desk , and around 8AM tomorrow , I ’d probably remember all that and have a very thorough meltdown . So for now , I was going to ride the high . "

96420	96622	96394	96394	You	1496	” Also known as the corner of Drink My Ass Off and Dance Till Four , I declared silently , yanking out my hair tie and shaking out my topknot . I was in a rare mood . I was feeling bold … liberated . Practically drunk off the thrill of having no responsibilities tomorrow . For the first time in my adult life , I had no one to report to , not a soul to be on call for , and I felt good about it , which was something I knew would n’t last , so … why not take advantage of tonight and do something crazy ? Well . I bit my lip . I had answers for that . A bevy of them that had to do with spur - of - the - moment decisions having deep and lasting consequences , and how I should really , really know that better than anyone else . But before I could get into that buzzkill with myself , a storm of texts pinged in my phone . Perfect timing . I reached into my pocket , knowing without looking that the messages were all from my best friend .
97336	97360	97361	97361	I	0	“ Lia , we ’re officially in the same building – ca n’t this wait till I meet you up on the roof ? ”
97415	97483	97413	97413	man	1655	“ No , Sara , it can not wait , because you strung me along all night with your cryptic - ass texts and now that I finally know what the heck is going on , I ’m drunk and I ’m excited and I ’m ready to butter up some hotties for you so they ’re nice and warm by the time you get up here ! ”
97484	97496	97413	97413	man	1655	“ Oh , that just sounds … so creepy , Lia . ”
97497	97501	97502	97502	She	1519	“ Did it ? ”
97509	97561	97502	97502	She	1519	“ I guess so . Lukas is giving me the weirdest look right now . But whatever , it ’s not your night , Lukas – I ’m talking to Lukas right now – it ’s Sara ’s night . Right , Sara ? I ’m talking to you right now . ”
97584	97592	97562	97562	I	0	“ Sure , drunkie , it is . ”
97593	97637	97644	97644	Lia	170	“ Exactly . So listen . I was talking to this guy just now who is a solid nine – do n’t look at me like that , Lukas – and he is a total sweetheart . Like , such a nice person . ”
97638	97643	97644	97644	Lia	170	“ Uh - huh . ”

97812	97842	97808	97808	I	0	“ I appreciate your tip , and I love you very much , but I do n’t think a cat dad sweetheart is what I ’m looking for tonight . ”
97843	97848	97779	97779	Lia	170	“ What ? Why ? ”
97849	97856	97857	97857	I	0	“ Is this a serious question ? ”
97868	97882	97857	97857	I	0	“ And do we really need to be having this conversation right now ? ”
97883	97918	97919	97919	Lia	170	“ Yes , Sara , it ’s a serious question , because I ’m drunk , and when I ’m drunk , I have comprehension issues , which makes every question a serious question , ”
97939	97983	97935	97935	she	170	“ Now explain to me why you do n’t want the nice guy I picked for you when I already told him all about you , and please tell me why you keep trying to get off the phone with me all night ! ”
97984	97987	97988	97988	I	0	“ Because , ”
97991	98153	97988	97988	I	0	“ For starters , I just spent the past however many years having a bunch of okay sex with a guy I was the bare minimum of attracted to , so tonight I specifically do n’t want that kind of sex . I want good , sweaty … kind of mean sex with a man who ’ll just pin me down and … fuck me so hard he breaks the headboard . And to answer your second question , I want to get off the phone because I do n’t want to talk about the mind - blowing sex I ’m going to have tonight , I just want to have it . Thinking about it is turning me on to the point of torture right now and being on the phone with you while I ’m this insane level of horny actually feels kind of weird , so will you please just let me get in the elevator , Li ? ”
98165	98178	98159	98159	I	0	“ Because it ’s here , I ’m in , and I – ”

98664	98704	98653	98653	I	0	“ In my defense , I just had a bit of a catastrophic day , and tomorrow ’s probably going to be worse . So I ’m giving myself basically the next ten hours to do whatever I want . ”

98715	98724	98710	98710	He	287	“ That ’s not a lot of time . ”

98936	98961	98962	98962	He	287	“ You do n’t have to be shy . Like I said , it ’s a fuck - it kind of night for me . ”

98996	99020	99021	99021	he	287	“ Then I guess I ’m just wondering how a girl who looks like you has trouble getting someone to pin her down , ”
99025	99052	99021	99021	he	287	“ and fuck her as hard as she wants . Pretty sure any straight man would be happy to sacrifice a headboard or two for that . ”

99166	99178	99162	99162	I	0	“ Do n’t be coy . You know what I mean . ”
99182	99208	99179	99179	I	0	“ I want to say I do , but I feel like I need to confirm , because this all feels very surreal right now . ”

99287	99302	99278	99278	he	1583	“ Hot . Really fucking hot . The kind that makes men feel urgent . ”
99303	99307	99308	99308	He	1583	“ Urgent how ? ”
99318	99344	99308	99308	He	1583	“ Like they need to jerk or fuck the image of you out of their head . Does that paint a clear picture for you ? ”
99348	99351	99308	99308	He	1583	“ Fairly . ”
99352	99357	99358	99358	he	1583	“ Any more questions ? ”
