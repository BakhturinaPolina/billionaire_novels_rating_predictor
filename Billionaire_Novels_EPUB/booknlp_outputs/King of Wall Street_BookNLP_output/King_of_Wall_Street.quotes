2531	2537	2538	2538	Joey	87	“ How ’s the bossman ? ”
2541	2547	2548	2548	Donna	86	“ Oh , you know , ”
2551	2566	2548	2548	Donna	86	“ Working too hard , as usual . What was his order , Harper ? ”

2720	2724	2725	2725	I	0	“ I know . ”
2728	2748	2725	2725	I	0	“ That was childish . I ’m sorry . I just wish he was n’t such a . . . ”
2749	2755	2756	2756	I	0	“ Tell me what happened . ”
2795	2807	2808	2808	Joey	87	“ Tell Max the Yankees deserved all they got this weekend , ”
2851	2857	2858	2858	Donna	86	“ I ’ll tell him , ”
2863	2887	2858	2858	Donna	86	“ but he might move his business elsewhere if I do . You know how touchy he is when the Mets do well . ”
2888	2921	2858	2858	Donna	86	“ He ’s going to have to get used to it this season . And I ’m not worried about losing him . He ’s been coming here for over a decade . ”
2926	2936	2937	2937	Donna	86	“ You know what he ’d say to that ? ”
2951	2963	2964	2964	Joey	87	“ Yeah , yeah , never take your customers for granted . ”
2971	2980	2981	2981	he	87	“ You know what always shuts him up ? ”
2990	3010	3011	3011	Joey	87	“ When you tell him to come back after his business has lasted three generations and is still going ? ”
3016	3021	3011	3011	Joey	87	“ You got it . ”
3022	3035	3036	3036	I	0	“ So Max has been coming here a long time , huh ? ”
3061	3077	3039	3039	Joey	87	“ Since I ’ve been working for him . And that ’s nearly seven years . ”
3078	3088	3104	3104	her	86	“ A creature of habit . I get that . ”
3107	3153	3102	3102	Donna	86	“ More a huge sense of loyalty . As this area built up and lunch places opened up on every corner , Joey ’s business took a bit of a hit . Max has never gone anywhere else . He ’s even brought clients here . ”
3174	3201	3168	3168	I	0	“ He can be challenging and demanding and a pain in the ass , but that ’s a big part of what ’s made him successful . ”
3246	3278	3279	3279	She	86	“ He ’s not as bad as you think he is . I mean , if he ’d said your report was good to go , what would you have learned ? ”
3285	3310	3311	3311	She	86	“ You ca n’t expect to get it all right your first time . And the stuff about the typos — was he wrong ? ”
3323	3326	3311	3311	She	86	“ No . ”
3335	3346	3327	3327	I	0	“ But you have to admit , his delivery sucks . ”
3382	3432	3433	3433	She	290	“ Sometimes . Until you ’ve proved yourself . But once you have , he ’ll back you completely . He gave me this job knowing I was a single mother , and he ’s made sure I ’ve never missed a game , event , or PTA meeting . ”
3441	3514	3515	3515	I	0	“ When my daughter got chicken pox just after I started working here , I came into the office anyway . I ’ve never seen him so mad . When he spotted me , he marched me out of the building and sent me home . I mean , my mom was looking after her , she was fine , but he insisted I stay home until she was back in school . ”
3528	3559	3525	3525	I	0	“ He ’s a really good guy . He ’s just focused and driven . And he takes his responsibility to his employees seriously — especially if they have potential . ”
3560	3578	3579	3579	Donna	86	“ I do n’t see him taking his responsibility to not be a condescending asshole very seriously . ”
3582	3616	3579	3579	Donna	86	“ You ’re there to learn , to get better . And he ’s going to teach you , but just saying you did a good job is n’t going to help you . ”
3653	3673	3674	3674	Donna	86	“ If you had known how today ’s meeting would play out , what would you have done differently ? ”
3694	3711	3687	3687	he	291	“ Come on . You ca n’t tell me you ’d do things exactly the same . ”
3712	3731	3732	3732	Donna	86	“ Okay , no . I would have printed out the sources and brought them into the meeting . ”
3735	3741	3742	3742	She	86	“ Good . What else ? ”
3750	3792	3742	3742	She	86	“ I would have probably tried Max ’s contact at the WTO a few more times — maybe emailed him . I could have tried harder to pin him down . And I could have sent the whole thing to proofreading . ”
3837	3885	3886	3886	Donna	86	“ I ’m not saying I did n’t learn anything . I just thought he ’d be nicer . I ’ve wanted to work with him a long time . I just did n’t imagine I ’d fantasize about punching him in the face quite so often . ”
3889	3901	3886	3886	Donna	86	“ That , Harper , is what having a boss means . ”
4113	4123	4124	4124	she	90	“ What ’s in here , a dead body ? ”
4141	4149	4124	4124	she	90	“ Yeah , my last best friend . ”
4171	4178	4179	4179	I	0	“ There ’s room for another . ”
4182	4192	4179	4179	I	0	“ There ’d better be wine in the refrigerator . ”
4198	4212	4195	4195	her	90	“ I ’m not used to being this physical with my clothes on . ”
4213	4229	4230	4230	I	0	“ You see , then you should be grateful . I ’m expanding your horizons , ”
4236	4245	4230	4230	I	0	“ Showing you how us ordinary gals live . ”
4305	4318	4299	4299	her	90	“ And I ’m too poor for a refrigerator . And wine . ”
4430	4441	4442	4442	Grace	90	“ It ’s going to be . . . cozy , ”
4445	4466	4442	4442	Grace	90	“ Are you sure you do n’t want me to ask about the one bedroom across the hall from me ? ”
4501	4520	4495	4495	I	0	“ I ’m sure . It ’s all part of the New York experience , is n’t it ? ”
4521	4543	4544	4544	Grace	90	“ So are roaches , but you do n’t have to seek them out . The idea is to avoid them . ”
4572	4629	4568	4568	I	0	“ Yeah , but I want to be in the center of things . Besides , there ’s a gym in the basement , so I ’m saving money there . And on the commute . I can walk to work from here . Hell , I can practically see the office from my bedroom window . ”
4630	4647	4648	4648	she	90	“ I thought you hated work . Would n’t it be better to be further away ? ”
4669	4681	4659	4659	I	0	“ I do n’t hate work . I hate my boss . ”
4682	4687	4688	4688	Grace	90	“ The hot one ? ”
4691	4699	4700	4700	I	0	“ Can you pick up your end ? ”
4737	4745	4723	4723	I	0	“ Crap . Have you got it ? ”
4757	4766	4767	4767	Grace	90	“ We need a man for this shit , ”
4776	4786	4787	4787	I	0	“ We need men for sex and foot rubs , ”
4790	4798	4787	4787	I	0	“ We can carry our own furniture . ”
4799	4816	4817	4817	I	0	“ In the future , you can carry your furniture . I ’ll find a man . ”
4831	4852	4817	4817	I	0	“ Just leave it here until I decide whether or not it should go at the end of the bed . ”
4853	4862	4863	4863	Grace	90	“ Where ’s that wine you promised me ? ”
4900	4931	4932	4932	I	0	“ What were you saying about your hot boss ? I thought you ’d changed religion to the Church of King while you were at Berkeley . What ’s changed ? ”
4974	4985	4960	4960	he	74	“ I think I need to update my work wardrobe . ”
5024	5044	5045	5045	I	0	“ You look fine . You ’re always super polished . Are you trying to impress your hot boss ? ”
5050	5073	5045	5045	I	0	“ That would be impossible . He ’s the most arrogant man you ’ll ever meet . Nothing ’s ever good enough . ”
5232	5239	5240	5240	Grace	90	“ Nothing ’s ever good enough ? ”
5243	5247	5240	5240	Grace	90	“ Sounds familiar . ”
5248	5304	5240	5240	Grace	90	“ I might be a bit of a perfectionist , but I ’ve got nothing on this guy . Believe me . I worked my heart out on a piece of work he gave me , and then he just ripped it to shreds . He had nothing good to say about it at all . ”
5305	5318	5240	5240	Grace	90	“ Why are you letting it bother you ? Shrug it off . ”
5349	5371	5337	5337	I	0	“ But I worked really hard on it and it was a good piece of work . He ’s an asshole . ”
5372	5390	5391	5391	Grace	90	“ So ? If he ’s a total wanker then why does his opinion count for anything ? ”
5431	5447	5427	5428	Max King	74	“ I ’m not saying it matters . Just that I ’m pissed about it . ”
5460	5480	5481	5481	She	90	“ What did you expect ? A man that rich and good looking is bound to have a downside . ”
5490	5520	5481	5481	She	90	“ You ca n’t let it affect you so much . Your expectations of men are way too high . You ’re going to spend your whole life disappointed . ”
5527	5533	5534	5534	I	0	“ Speaking of being disappointed . ”
5548	5552	5553	5553	I	0	“ Harper speaking , ”
5556	5565	5553	5553	I	0	“ Ms. Jayne . It ’s Kenneth Bray . ”
5575	5586	5568	5568	he	239	“ Yes , Mr. Bray . How can I help ? ”
5692	5723	5685	5685	he	239	“ I want to arrange for you to come into the office so I can talk you through the details of the money your father has set aside for you . ”
5724	5741	5768	5768	Grace	90	“ I appreciate your persistence , but I ’m not interested in my father ’s money . ”
5842	5847	5833	5833	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
5862	5865	5866	5866	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
6098	6106	6107	6107	Grace	90	“ You want to talk about it ? ”
6113	6140	6110	6110	I	0	“ Absolutely not . I wanna get a little drunk in my new apartment with my best friend . Maybe gossip and eat some ice cream . ”
6141	6147	6148	6148	Grace	90	“ That is our speciality , ”
6151	6158	6148	6148	Grace	90	“ Can we talk about boys ? ”
6159	6187	6110	6110	I	0	“ We can talk about boys but I ’m warning you , if you try to set me up I ’m kicking your ass back to Brooklyn . ”
6188	6201	6202	6202	I	0	“ But you have n’t even heard who it ’s with yet . ”
6212	6235	6205	6205	She	90	“ I ’m not interested in dating . I ’m focusing on my career . That way I ca n’t be disappointed . ”
6275	6289	6345	6346	Max King	74	“ You ’re so cynical . Not every man is like your father . ”
6290	6327	6328	6328	I	0	“ I did n’t say they were . Do n’t play amateur shrink on me . I just want to get established here in New York . Dating is n’t my priority . That ’s all . ”
6458	6461	6462	6462	I	0	“ Sex , ”
6465	6481	6462	6462	I	0	“ That ’s what men are good for . Maybe I ’ll take a lover . ”
6482	6487	6488	6488	Grace	90	“ That ’s all ? ”
6502	6511	6491	6491	I	0	“ What else do we need them for ? ”
6512	6515	6462	6462	I	0	“ Friendship ? ”
6516	6521	6522	6522	I	0	“ I have you , ”
6525	6529	6522	6522	I	0	“ Emotional support ? ”
6530	6553	6462	6462	I	0	“ Again , that ’s your job . You share it with ice cream , wine , and the occasional retail overspend . ”
6554	6576	6577	6577	Grace	90	“ And it ’s a job the four of us take very seriously . But what about when you want babies ? ”
6625	6652	6614	6614	I	0	“ If and when I ever get around to thinking about that stuff , I ’ll go to a sperm bank . Worked for my mother . ”
6653	6664	6665	6665	I	0	“ Your mom did n’t go to a sperm bank . ”
6673	6679	6665	6665	I	0	“ Might as well have . ”
6693	6710	6711	6711	I	0	“ Hand me your iPad . I want to see this hot boss of yours again . ”
6714	6718	6711	6711	I	0	“ Do n’t . ”
6737	6743	6719	6719	I	0	“ Max King , right ? ”
6749	6757	6758	6758	Grace	90	“ He really is ridiculously good looking . ”
6779	6812	6813	6813	I	0	“ Put it away . It ’s enough that I have to deal with him Monday through Friday . Let me enjoy my weekend without having to look at his arrogant face . ”
6862	6872	6873	6873	I	0	“ Was that a bomb that just went off ? ”
6876	6890	6873	6873	I	0	“ Sounds like your upstairs neighbor just dropped an anvil on the roadrunner . ”
6996	6998	7000	7001	the woman	368	“ fuck ”
7141	7154	7155	7155	Grace	90	“ That might be a guy I have to get to know , ”
7166	7178	7155	7155	Grace	90	“ He certainly sounded like he knew what he was doing . ”
7179	7188	7155	7155	Grace	90	“ They seemed very . . . compatible . ”
7244	7265	7239	7239	her	368	“ They sound like they have excellent sex . Maybe you should knock on their door and suggest a threesome . ”
7271	7281	7266	7266	I	0	“ Yeah , along with a cup of sugar . ”
7288	7295	7296	7296	Grace	90	“ She kept her heels on , ”
7299	7302	7296	7296	Grace	90	“ Nice . ”
7329	7365	7296	7296	Grace	90	“ Well , she got what she wanted and split . You ’re not going to need a TV in this place . You can just tune into the soap opera that is your neighbor . ”
7366	7374	7375	7375	I	0	“ You think she was a prostitute ? ”
7435	7448	7449	7449	Grace	90	“ A prostitute ? She ’s a lucky one if she is . ”
7452	7478	7479	7479	She	90	“ But I do n’t think so . A guy who can make a woman sound like that does n’t need to pay for it . ”
7499	7512	7479	7479	She	90	“ Right , I ’m going to get home to my vibrator . ”
7513	7522	7479	7479	She	90	“ That ’s really way too much information . ”
7523	7545	7479	7479	She	90	“ But keep me posted on your neighbors . And if you run into them , try to get a picture . ”
7546	7567	7568	7568	I	0	“ Yes , because if you ’re going to masturbate over my neighbors , it would go better with pictures . ”
7572	7584	7568	7568	I	0	“ You ’re a pervert . You know that , right ? ”
7590	7597	7585	7585	Grace	90	“ It was better than porn . ”
8144	8148	8149	8149	I	0	“ Come in , ”
8168	8174	8175	8175	Donna	86	“ Good morning , Max , ”
8189	8192	8178	8178	she	86	“ Thanks . ”
8211	8216	8193	8193	I	0	“ How are you ? ”
8217	8230	8200	8200	she	86	“ I ’m good . We have a lot to get through . ”
8244	8258	8238	8238	I	0	“ Is it me , or is it hotter in here than normal ? ”
8264	8287	8261	8261	her	86	“ No , and I ’m not turning up the A / C , either . It ’s ridiculously cold in here . ”
8322	8325	8326	8326	Donna	86	“ So , ”
8404	8410	8411	8411	Donna	86	“ What ’s going on ? ”
8414	8417	8418	8418	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
8428	8437	8418	8418	I	0	“ Are you okay ? You seem distracted . ”
8454	8480	8438	8438	I	0	“ I ’m fine . I just have a million things going on in my head . It ’s going to be a busy week . ”
8481	8510	8522	8523	a competitor	398	“ Okay then , let ’s get started . You have a lunch tomorrow with Wilson at D&G Consulting . It ’s fixed for twelve at Tribeca Grill . ”
8511	8519	8520	8520	Wilson	98	“ I suppose we ca n’t cancel ? ”
8556	8572	8546	8546	I	0	“ Yes , it ’s too late . You ’ve canceled the last three times . ”
8573	8583	8587	8587	her	86	“ And we ca n’t go to Joey ’s ? ”
8604	8619	8593	8593	I	0	“ And Harper wanted some time this afternoon as she ’s revised her report . ”
8646	8659	8660	8660	She	86	“ What are you doing ? I have your calendar right here . ”
8666	8675	8660	8660	She	86	“ You have time this afternoon at four . ”
8676	8707	8708	8708	I	0	“ I do n’t think we need a meeting . She should just leave what she ’s done with you , and I ’ll look at it when I can . ”

8736	8756	8708	8708	I	0	“ I ’m busy and have n’t got time to go through work that ’s probably not good enough . ”
8892	8900	8901	8901	Donna	86	“ Was the report really that bad ? ”
8904	8923	8901	8901	Donna	86	“ No , but I do n’t need her sitting there watching me read it through , either . ”
9007	9021	9022	9022	I	0	“ Especially if you ’re going to make me have lunch with Wilson , ”
9068	9081	9062	9062	She	86	“ Look , I do n’t want to speak out of turn — ”
9082	9087	9088	9088	I	0	“ Then do n’t , ”
9183	9206	9178	9178	She	86	“ You ’re being pretty harsh with her , and I do n’t think it ’s about her performance in the office . ”
9243	9253	9254	9254	she	86	“ Has this got anything to do with Amanda ? ”
9281	9298	9299	9299	she	86	“ It must be an adjustment for both of you . How long since Pandora left ? ”
9302	9314	9299	9299	she	86	“ About six weeks . Yes , it ’s an adjustment . ”
9343	9363	9364	9364	I	0	“ I ’ve always been so involved in her life ; I did n’t realize how much would change . ”
9428	9444	9445	9445	I	0	“ We ’re getting used to each other . And the commute is a challenge . ”
9523	9546	9547	9547	I	0	“ She wants to dye her hair . I ’ve said no a million times , but she wo n’t drop it . ”
9560	9579	9580	9580	Donna	86	“ I swear I ’m going to get home one day to find she ’s done it anyway . ”
9583	9623	9580	9580	Donna	86	“ Teenage girls are a challenge . I ’m happy I ’m still a few years away from that . I mean , I know what used to go through my head at fourteen . It ’s not pretty . ”
9640	9650	9651	9651	I	0	“ I ’m not sure I want to know , ”
9664	9695	9661	9661	Donna	86	“ Believe me , you ’re better off in the dark . Try to say yes sometimes , that way everything is n’t a fight . What does Pandora say ? ”
9696	9712	9661	9661	Donna	86	“ That she ’d cut my balls off if I let her dye her hair . ”
9713	9724	9725	9725	Pandora	99	“ Well at least you ’re on the same page . ”
10002	10060	9994	9994	her	99	“ Yeah . It ’s more of a change than I expected , though . Before if she ’d asked to dye her hair I ’d have either told her to ask her mother , or said no and dropped her off at home , leaving Pandora with the fallout . Now it ’s all on me . ”
10061	10073	10139	10139	Amanda	81	“ Remember , Amanda ’s probably missing her mother , too . ”
10074	10097	10139	10139	Amanda	81	“ It was her idea for them to go without her . Jason was ready to turn down the job in Zurich . ”
10098	10128	10129	10129	I	0	“ I know , but she ’s at the age when sometimes she can see an adult ’s point of view , and yet sometimes still be a kid . ”
10169	10201	10202	10202	I	0	“ They Skype all the time . I think I have more to do with Pandora now than I ever did before . We literally Skyped all through dinner last night . ”
10205	10228	10202	10202	I	0	“ It was nice actually . I think Pandora ’s worried she has n’t done the right thing leaving her with me . ”
10229	10248	10249	10249	I	0	“ I ’m sure it ’ll be fine . You just need to get used to each other . ”
10252	10260	10249	10249	I	0	“ Yes , I hope if she — ”
10265	10271	10272	10272	I	0	“ Here she is now . ”

10310	10322	10323	10323	Donna	86	“ But I ’d look better with blond hair , right ? ”
10328	10346	10323	10323	Donna	86	“ I ’m so not getting into that . I ’ll give you guys a few minutes . ”
10347	10356	10357	10357	I	0	“ Hey , peanut . What ’s up ? ”
10367	10377	10360	10360	Donna	86	“ Was just wondering when you were coming home . ”
10391	10403	10404	10404	My	0	“ Probably not until eight . Marion ’s there , right ? ”
10432	10450	10451	10451	My	0	“ Yeah , she ’s here . I just thought maybe you ’d be back early today . ”
10490	10496	10477	10477	She	81	“ How was your morning ? ”
10497	10509	10461	10461	she	81	“ Ugh . I do n’t want to talk about it . ”
10510	10535	10477	10477	She	81	“ Are you still fighting with Samantha ? You know you ’ll feel better if you get it out . Problems are like shit — ”
10536	10539	10540	10540	I	0	“ Daaad . ”
10566	10575	10576	10576	she	81	“ Samantha got asked to the dance already , ”
10584	10601	10602	10602	My	0	“ What do you mean asked ? Like a boy asked her ? On a date ? ”
10611	10629	10608	10608	I	0	“ You ’re in middle school , for Christ ’s sake — you ca n’t be dating . ”
10659	10667	10656	10656	her	81	“ I ’m fourteen , not twelve . ”
10673	10689	10690	10690	I	0	“ But you ’re going with Patti and all your friends , are n’t you ? ”
10705	10709	10690	10690	I	0	“ Sure but — ”
10710	10723	10724	10724	I	0	“ You want a boy to ask you and he has n’t ? ”
10744	10769	10727	10727	her	81	“ No . Not yet . Thanks for reminding me . I ’m going to call Mom . I ’ll talk to you later . ”
10770	10779	10780	10780	She	81	“ Amanda , do n’t go . What — ”
10928	10932	10933	10933	I	0	“ Come in , ”
10966	10969	10970	10970	I	0	“ What ? ”
10978	10984	10985	10985	She	81	“ The revised Bangladesh report . ”
10991	11000	11001	11001	She	81	“ You could have left it with Donna . ”
11013	11039	11001	11001	She	81	“ I ’m sure if I ’d left it with Donna , you ’d have told me I should have handed it to you directly . ”
11197	11220	11188	11188	I	0	“ Well now you ’re here , just leave it on my desk and I ’ll try to get to it later . ”
11221	11231	11232	11232	she	81	“ I ’ll leave your sandwich with Donna then , ”
11478	11481	11482	11482	Amanda	81	“ Pancakes ? ”
11591	11597	11598	11598	she	81	“ You ’re home early , ”
11669	11676	11677	11677	she	81	“ Like half a day early , ”
11680	11703	11677	11677	she	81	“ Thought I ’d spend some time with my favorite lady . I sent Marion home , so we ’re having pancakes . ”
11787	11794	11795	11795	I	0	“ Speak to your mom today ? ”
11845	11851	11842	11843	a talker	458	“ Nope . Not yet . ”
11863	11872	11852	11852	I	0	“ Bobby Clapham invited Samantha to the dance . ”
11891	11909	11888	11888	her	81	“ And I thought that Callum Ryder would ask me , but he has n’t said anything . ”
11972	11982	11983	11983	I	0	“ Callum Ryder , he ’s in your class ? ”
12087	12101	12102	12102	she	81	“ Oh my God . Do n’t you listen to anything I say ? ”
12105	12123	12102	12102	she	81	“ Callum moved here from San Francisco last semester . Do n’t you remember me telling you ? ”
12124	12129	12130	12130	I	0	“ Oh , right . ”
12162	12174	12152	12152	we	466	“ And you want him to ask you to the dance ? ”
12198	12201	12202	12202	she	81	“ Maybe , ”
12205	12235	12202	12202	she	81	“ But only because he ’s funny , and I saw him dance once during lunch and he seemed to be able to move in time to the music . ”
12236	12244	12245	12245	I	0	“ So everyone is going as couples ? ”
12258	12264	12265	12265	she	81	“ What do you mean ? ”
12280	12296	12265	12265	she	81	“ If Callum asked you to the dance , he ’d pick you up and — ”
12297	12319	12320	12320	She	81	“ No , Samantha and I are going together . You said you ’d drive us . You do n’t remember ? ”
12341	12347	12348	12348	I	0	“ Yeah , I remember , ”
12351	12363	12348	12348	I	0	“ But I thought you and Samantha were no longer friends ? ”
12364	12373	12320	12320	She	81	“ Last week , Dad . Keep up . ”
12374	12398	12399	12399	She	81	“ Okay , explain it to me because I do n’t know how these things work . So you ’ll see Callum there ? ”
12402	12406	12399	12399	She	81	“ I guess . ”
12440	12452	12453	12453	I	0	“ So do you have your costume yet for this dance ? ”
12456	12471	12453	12453	I	0	“ Costume ? You mean a dress ? It ’s not a costume party . ”
12475	12487	12472	12472	I	0	“ Give me a break . Do you have a dress ? ”
12491	12514	12488	12488	She	81	“ I wondered if you wanted some company in the city this week ? You know , we could go shopping maybe ? ”
12515	12519	12520	12520	I	0	“ In Manhattan ? ”
12588	12591	12592	12592	she	81	“ Yes , ”

12606	12616	12624	12624	her	81	“ I want something no one else will have . ”
12627	12663	12624	12624	her	81	“ Just because I ’m fourteen does n’t mean finding the perfect dress is n’t important , if that ’s what you ’re thinking . Perhaps if you ever dated , you ’d get it . ”
12705	12728	12702	12702	Harper	74	“ I want you to look pretty . Of course I understand that . I have plenty of women in my life . ”
12749	12761	12762	12762	Amanda	81	“ You always think about it in such a selfish way . ”
12842	12851	12852	12852	I	0	“ I ’m being selfish by not dating ? ”
12860	12914	12852	12852	I	0	“ Totally . You know how much I ’ve always wanted a sister . Mom ’s been married to Jason for forever and they ’ve completely ignored me , so it ’s up to you . I do n’t understand what you ’re waiting for . Do n’t you want to get married ? ”
12915	12952	12953	12953	She	482	“ Hey , wait . A minute ago you were talking about you dating and now , not only do I have to date , but I have to marry a woman and get her pregnant ? ”
13007	13038	13004	13004	She	482	“ Do n’t you ever think about it ? We ’re here in the big house , just the two of us , and I ’ll be in college soon . ”
13039	13060	13061	13061	She	482	“ Are you trying to kill me today ? You have a couple of years before you leave for college . ”
13100	13133	13134	13134	She	482	“ I think it would be nice for you to have someone . And if I got a baby sister out of it ? Well , then that would be even better . ”
13150	13172	13134	13134	She	482	“ What ’s brought this on ? I have n’t had this particular lecture from you for a while , peanut . ”
13208	13230	13205	13205	She	482	“ Dunno . Samantha ’s mom was asking whether or not you were dating , and it just got me wondering . ”
13294	13315	13316	13316	I	0	“ I think it would be nice if you found someone is all . And I want a baby sister . ”
13407	13426	13404	13404	Amanda	81	“ You would n’t miss our father - daughter time together ? Eating pancakes , watching the game ? ”
13427	13460	13499	13499	Amanda	81	“ Why would we have to stop doing that ? The three of us could do it together , and when Chelsea was old enough , she could have pancakes , too . ”
13461	13464	13465	13465	I	0	“ Chelsea ? ”
13469	13492	13465	13465	I	0	“ My baby sister . Or maybe Amy would be better . I like that our names would both begin with an A. ”

13515	13526	13499	13499	Amanda	81	“ I could find you a date if you wanted . ”
13527	13535	13496	13496	I	0	“ Stop it and eat your pancakes . ”
13536	13569	13496	13496	I	0	“ If you agree to go on a date , I wo n’t tell Mom you ’re feeding me pancakes on a Monday night . You know she ’d have a cow . ”
13587	13598	13599	13599	I	0	“ Tell me you ’re not trying to blackmail me . ”
13612	13632	13599	13599	I	0	“ I ’ll take my chances with your mother . She knows how sometimes sugar is the only solution . ”

13655	13677	13599	13599	I	0	“ Please just think about taking a woman to dinner . Tinder is meant to be the place to find someone . ”
13680	13709	13599	13599	I	0	“ Promise me you ’re not on Tinder , or I ’m taking your phone and you ’re not getting it back until you hit thirty - five . ”
13710	13729	13732	13732	she	501	“ Dad , of course I ’m not on Tinder . Are you crazy ? I ’m fourteen . ”
13737	13747	13732	13732	she	501	“ Tinder ’s for old people . Like you . ”

23613	23619	23557	23557	she	81	“ It ’s called strapless . ”
23620	23642	23648	23648	she	81	“ I do n’t care what it ’s called — it barely covers your butt . You ’re not wearing it . ”

24255	24278	24279	24280	the assistant	712	“ It ’s sheer , but the lace covers all the important bits , so it looks more revealing than it is , ”

24907	24942	24881	24881	she	81	“ Amanda , you ’d look pretty in anything . That ’s not the point . A girlfriend would n’t change my mind about you wearing clothes meant for women much older than you . ”

25299	25309	25296	25296	She	687	“ It ’s one night out of your life . ”
25318	25346	25312	25312	she	687	“ And I ’ll do piano practice for a week without you having to ask . Think of it as the bill of rights to our treaty . ”
25379	25391	25361	25361	She	687	“ I should n’t have to force you to do piano . ”
25392	25399	25400	25400	She	687	“ It ’s up to you . ”
25403	25412	25400	25400	She	687	“ Seems like a sweet deal to me . ”
25413	25429	25430	25430	She	687	“ A month . And you have to drop the whining about the hair dye . ”
25436	25439	25430	25430	She	687	“ Deal . ”

26499	26509	26510	26510	she	773	“ Another glamourous Friday night in New York City ? ”
26546	26551	26552	26552	I	0	“ Something like that , ”
26555	26571	26552	26552	I	0	“ But better that than waste my time on men who do n’t deserve me . ”
26575	26594	26572	26572	She	773	“ Yes , doing laundry is preferable to spending time with most of the men I ’ve dated . ”
26620	26631	26632	26632	she	773	“ Let ’s hope my date tonight raises the bar , ”
26635	26658	26632	26632	she	773	“ He seems nice so far , and every now and then you have to take a chance on someone , right ? ”
26691	26696	26697	26697	she	773	“ Enjoy your evening , ”
26868	26871	26872	26872	I	0	“ Hi , ”
26875	26878	26879	26879	she	792	“ Hey , ”
26898	26903	26904	26904	I	0	“ Are you hiding ? ”
26948	26963	26938	26938	her	792	“ Not really . I ’m doing laundry and homework at the same time . ”
26964	26971	26972	26972	I	0	“ You do your own laundry ? ”
26991	27014	26988	26988	She	792	“ Only certain times of the month . When I ’m at my dad ’s place there are some things . . . ”
27015	27027	27028	27028	She	792	“ I get it . Boys have it easy , huh ? ”
27056	27074	27030	27030	her	792	“ So easy . I mean , no periods ? How did God decide that was fair ? ”
27086	27101	27102	27102	I	0	“ Well , you ’ve got to assume God is a man , right ? ”
27114	27133	27102	27102	I	0	“ And I guess he understood that men are such babies they would n’t be able to cope . ”
27134	27153	27154	27154	I	0	“ Babies is right . They squeal when they do n’t get their way , just like infants . ”
27157	27163	27154	27154	I	0	“ You ’re totally right . ”
27164	27196	27197	27197	She	795	“ And they always think they ’re right about everything . My dad went ballistic yesterday because I picked out a dress for my eighth grade dance he did n’t like . ”
27210	27231	27197	27197	She	795	“ I told him I ’m growing up and that wearing a strapless dress does n’t make me a slut . ”
27232	27262	27207	27207	her	795	“ No , it does n’t . But I guess dads have a different view . I ca n’t say because I did n’t have a father growing up . ”
27309	27318	27319	27319	she	800	“ You did n’t ? Did he die ? ”
27334	27345	27331	27331	I	0	“ No . He just was n’t interested in me . ”
27353	27369	27346	27347	The girl	2103	“ Well my dad is entirely too interested . I thought my mom was strict . ”
27370	27380	27381	27381	She	800	“ What does your mom say about the dress ? ”
27384	27405	27381	27381	She	800	“ Dad has the final say . Before she used to be able to talk him around , but now ? ”
27411	27433	27408	27408	her	800	“ I keep telling him he needs a girlfriend . He needs an adult to tell him I ’m right sometimes . ”
27434	27444	27408	27408	her	800	“ You want your dad to have a girlfriend ? ”
27460	27514	27408	27408	her	800	“ Sure . He ’s been on his own for so long and I want him to be happy . I do n’t ever remember him having a girlfriend , and my mom has Jason . They ’ve been married forever . I do n’t want my dad to be on his own . ”
27526	27536	27408	27408	her	800	“ Does your father get along with your stepdad ? ”
27537	27548	27408	27408	her	800	“ Yeah . They used to play basketball every week . ”
27561	27571	27572	27572	I	0	“ Wow , that sounds like a friendly divorce , ”
27578	27587	27575	27575	She	804	“ My mom and dad were never married . ”
27622	27699	27700	27700	I	0	“ Dad just works too hard , and we have fun but I think he needs fun with a girlfriend . You know . Plus , I ’d like to have someone to hang out with , go shopping with . And most of all , I ’d like a baby sister . I ’ve always been the only kid around , amongst a bunch of adults . I ’m always the youngest and it sucks . ”
27703	27723	27700	27700	I	0	“ You ’re trying to get him to have another baby ? You have to go easy on him . ”
27735	27773	27724	27724	I	0	“ He ’d probably be just the same if he were married . Sounds like he cares about you . And because he is a man , your dad knows what goes on in boys ’ heads . ”
27795	27802	27803	27803	she	812	“ Do you have a boyfriend ? ”
27811	27823	27806	27806	I	0	“ Nope . I ’m concentrating on my work for now . ”
27879	27888	27876	27877	an asshole	2000	“ That ’s always my dad ’s answer . ”
27889	27898	27899	27899	I	0	“ I ’m not good at picking guys . ”
27980	28005	27970	27970	I	0	“ I figure I ’ll work hard , make my own money , have fun , and see if Prince Charming shows up unexpectedly . ”
28017	28043	28009	28009	I	0	“ The thing about boys is that you can think they ’re going to be one thing and they turn out to be entirely another . ”
28096	28099	28100	28100	she	828	“ Really ? ”
28107	28140	28100	28100	she	828	“ Sure . Be careful to avoid the guys who tell you how great they are . I ’m looking for a man who shows me what a great guy he is . ”
28153	28164	28145	28145	Max	74	“ Judge people by their actions , not their words . ”
28165	28186	28100	28100	she	828	“ Everyone keeps telling me that Callum Ryder likes me , but he has n’t asked me to the dance . ”
28187	28204	28205	28205	She	830	“ Does that happen in the eighth grade ? You go as boy - girl couples ? ”
28213	28235	28205	28205	She	830	“ You do n’t go together . I guess it just means you ’ll dance with them when you ’re there . ”
28241	28253	28205	28205	She	830	“ Right . And you want Callum Ryder to ask you ? ”
28254	28267	28205	28205	She	830	“ Well , if he likes me , I thought he would . ”
28268	28288	28289	28289	I	0	“ But do you like him ? Do n’t be satisfied with a boy just because he likes you . ”
28296	28306	28289	28289	I	0	“ He ’s popular , and good at sports . ”
28307	28320	28321	28321	I	0	“ Do you get butterflies in your stomach when you see him ? ”
28356	28368	28369	28369	she	834	“ I ’m not sure . I do n’t think so , ”
28372	28400	28369	28369	she	834	“ If he does n’t give you butterflies , he ’s not worth going toe - to - toe with your dad for . He sounds protective . ”
28415	28435	28436	28436	I	0	“ Do n’t get me wrong , I love my dad . He ’s just not good with women . ”
28439	28456	28436	28436	I	0	“ None of them are . It ’s a good lesson to learn early in life . ”
28457	28491	28503	28503	She	835	“ And he wants me to stay a baby . I do n’t want go to my eighth grade dance wearing a frilly dress that a three - year - old would wear . ”
28492	28502	28503	28503	She	835	“ You got a picture of the strapless one ? ”
28526	28547	28548	28548	I	0	“ It ’s pretty , but I think you can do better by leaving a little more to the imagination , ”
28551	28555	28548	28548	I	0	“ Can I ? ”
28578	28603	28565	28565	I	0	“ Have you thought about one of those dresses with a long sheer skirt over a shorter skirt ? That might make him happy . ”
28609	28615	28616	28616	she	835	“ What ’s your name ? ”
28619	28631	28616	28616	she	835	“ Harper . Finder of eighth - grade - dance dresses . ”
28632	28647	28604	28604	She	835	“ I ’m Amanda . Needer of an eighth - grade - dance dress . ”
28648	28653	28654	28654	I	0	“ It ’s fate , ”
28661	28674	28654	28654	I	0	“ Do you think I could do strapless if it ’s long ? ”
28693	28716	28717	28717	I	0	“ I do n’t think strapless is the most flattering style . I think you can still show off some skin here , ”
28727	28750	28717	28717	I	0	“ without upsetting your dad . We need to find something off the shoulder . Suits all women , young and old . ”
28756	28764	28751	28751	Amanda	81	“ That sounds like it could work . ”
28765	28779	28780	28780	I	0	“ And then maybe something long but with a slit up the leg ? ”
28828	28858	28859	28859	She	81	“ I better go back . He ’ll be home from work and wondering where I am . I left a note , but he wo n’t read it . ”
28876	28882	28870	28870	Dad	107	“ Speak of the devil . ”
28883	28888	28889	28889	She	81	“ Hi , Dad . ”
28894	28903	28889	28889	She	81	“ Yes , I ’m coming up now . ”
28904	28910	28911	28911	she	81	“ He has dinner ready , ”
28914	28919	28911	28911	she	81	“ I better go . ”
28947	28987	28944	28945	a keeper	843	“ Never say no to a man who can cook . And remember , be nice to him . That ’s the way to get what you want . Men get taken in so easily by a few compliments . ”
28993	28999	28988	28988	I	0	“ Thank you so much . ”
29018	29027	29028	29028	she	81	“ I ’m going shopping again next week , ”
29036	29062	29028	29028	she	81	“ Yesterday was a total bust , but at least now I wo n’t just try the same things again and have the same argument . ”
29063	29087	29088	29088	Amanda	81	“ Exactly . Men have to think they ’ve won . Never let on that really , you ’ve gotten your own way . ”
29091	29099	29088	29088	Amanda	81	“ I need boy lessons from you . ”
29100	29104	29105	29105	I	0	“ Single girl , ”
29112	29119	29105	29105	I	0	“ I do n’t know anything . ”
29120	29151	29088	29088	Amanda	81	“ That ’s not true . I ’m not going to listen to a word boys say from now on . I ’m only going to watch what they do . ”
29152	29178	29179	29179	She	81	“ You ’ll go far if you remember that . It was so nice to meet you , Amanda . Have fun at your dance . ”
29409	29415	29416	29416	I	0	“ Is that a penis ? ”
29486	29504	29469	29469	I	0	“ No , it ’s not a penis . Why would my boyfriend paint a gigantic knob ? ”
29505	29516	29517	29517	I	0	“ Men are weird . And obsessed with their penis , ”
29555	29565	29566	29566	Grace	90	“ Many of the great artists painted beautiful women , ”
29569	29583	29566	29566	Grace	90	“ Exactly . Because they were obsessed with their penis . Case closed . ”
29584	29593	29594	29594	Grace	90	“ How ’re things with your asshole boss ? ”
29648	29653	29642	29642	I	0	“ Still an asshole . ”
29671	29679	29680	29680	she	90	“ What are you going to do ? ”
29695	29715	29683	29683	I	0	“ What can I do ? I ’m just going to grow a thick skin and stick it out . ”
29770	29789	29763	29763	I	0	“ Great . So I have to listen to you moan about him for the next two years ? ”
29790	29811	29812	29812	I	0	“ You brought it up , and anyway , I have to put up with things like this for you . ”
29848	29858	29859	29859	I	0	“ Did they forget to put something in here ? ”
29862	29888	29859	29859	I	0	“ No , it ’s supposed to be some kind of commentary on reality TV and how the public will watch anything the networks commission . ”
29895	29911	29891	29891	her	90	“ I think that ’s it . Or they might have just forgotten the art . ”
29939	29946	29936	29936	she	90	“ Harper , this is George . ”
30022	30050	30051	30051	Grace	90	“ George , this is Harper , my best friend in the world . Keep her company ? Damien ’s taking me to look at his etchings . ”
30083	30096	30097	30097	I	0	“ Excuse Grace . She was dropped on her head a lot , ”
30100	30105	30106	30106	George	139	“ As a baby ? ”

30186	30196	30197	30197	he	139	“ Thank God I ’m not the only one , ”
30205	30227	30228	30228	He	139	“ Do n’t tell Damien I said so , but what the fuck ? Have you been into the black room ? ”
30243	30255	30228	30228	He	139	“ It ’s full of women holding their heads and screaming . ”

30265	30281	30260	30260	I	0	“ Women sick of bad dates ? Sorry , present company excepted , of course . ”
30286	30307	30282	30282	He	139	“ Maybe . I did n’t recognize anyone , so I ’m hopeful none of my exes are in there . ”
30341	30345	30334	30334	I	0	“ Another drink ? ”
30346	30352	30353	30353	We	873	“ The bar I like . ”

30395	30423	30360	30369	people who all seemed to have similar taste in art	874	“ No , I ’m named after my grandfather , not George Michael . Although I am a fan , particularly of his day - glow period . ”
30467	30487	30449	30449	We	873	“ I ’m an architect , I ’m from Ohio , and I do n’t like cats . You ? ”
30488	30494	30495	30495	I	0	“ I ’m from Sacramento , ”
30498	30515	30495	30495	I	0	“ I do n’t like cats either and I ’m a researcher at a consulting firm . ”
30516	30533	30449	30449	We	873	“ Grace said you were new to the city . Did you move for the job ? ”

30568	30586	30449	30449	We	873	“ And now that you ’re doing it , is it all you thought it would be ? ”
30587	30597	30556	30557	Max King	74	“ I do n’t get along with my boss . ”
30598	30601	30602	30602	he	74	“ Oh , ”
30607	30642	30602	30602	he	74	“ But does anyone ? I mean , is n’t it like the rule that you hate your boss ? Is n’t he just there to stand between you and your internet surfing habit ? ”
30648	30674	30643	30643	I	0	“ I do n’t resent him because he interrupts my online shopping experience . I enjoy what I do . My boss is just rude . ”
30678	30682	30643	30643	I	0	“ And arrogant . ”
30688	30692	30643	30643	I	0	“ And ungrateful . ”

30786	30815	30767	30767	I	0	“ Do n’t sweat it . Like I said , I think it ’s part of the job — some people are n’t ever going to like you . ”
30816	30824	30825	30825	I	0	“ And you ’re okay with that ? ”
30831	30868	30869	30869	I	0	“ I ’m not sure I ’ve thought about it . Whether or not I ’m okay with it , it ’s still going to happen , right ? Not everyone likes you , do they ? ”
30872	30892	30869	30869	I	0	“ Hey , you ’ve only known me a few minutes and already you think people must hate me ? ”
30893	30965	30968	30968	he	880	“ It ’s not personal . And when you ’re signing someone ’s paycheck , things just get magnified . Normally , if you do n’t get along with people , you do n’t have chemistry with someone , you can just avoid them . But at work , you ’re forced to spend time with them , so you ’re just more aware that you do n’t like the person . ”
30985	30989	30968	30968	he	880	“ I guess . ”
30990	31015	31016	31016	I	0	“ How about I distract you from work one night this week , take you to dinner and prove not all bosses are evil ? ”
31025	31029	31030	31030	I	0	“ This week ? ”
31033	31043	31030	31030	I	0	“ Yeah , unless you ’re booked up already . ”

31372	31377	31369	31369	I	0	“ No , yes . ”
31382	31395	31378	31378	He	74	“ Get in . I ’ve been wanting to speak to you . ”

37044	37053	37054	37054	she	90	“ So what are you going to do ? ”
37057	37063	37054	37054	she	90	“ Is he boyfriend material ? ”
37064	37075	37076	37076	I	0	“ I have no idea . And of course not . ”
37091	37107	37076	37076	I	0	“ What was I thinking , fucking my boss ? Now I have to quit . ”
37108	37139	37149	37149	her	90	“ He said he did n’t know who your father was . Would n’t he have said something already if he did ? Is he the liar - y type ? ”
37140	37145	37146	37146	I	0	“ Liar - y ? ”
37158	37171	37146	37146	I	0	“ It ’s in the Dictionary of Grace . Look it up . ”
37223	37239	37209	37209	I	0	“ Does it matter ? He knows now . My father invited him to pitch . ”
37240	37249	37250	37250	I	0	“ And he said your father told him ? ”
37255	37278	37250	37250	I	0	“ No , he said he put two and two together , and then he asked for my help with the pitch . ”
37279	37291	37209	37209	I	0	“ And you do n’t want to work for your father ? ”
37292	37300	37250	37250	I	0	“ Not because of my last name . ”
37312	37347	37301	37301	Grace	90	“ I get that , but you are where you are . Max is saying he did n’t know . Are you going to cut your face off to spite your nose by quitting ? ”
37348	37410	37209	37209	I	0	“ I definitely wo n’t be cutting my face off , or even my nose , but I do think I have to quit . It ’s all too humiliating . Everyone ’s going to know who my father is and why I got the job , and I ca n’t work with the man who fucked me to get ahead . ”
37411	37429	37430	37430	She	955	“ You ’re thinking like a woman . You need to think like you have a penis . ”
37451	37489	37490	37490	She	955	“ However you got this job , you need to prove you deserve it because you ’re good at what you do , not because of your last name and not because you ’re banging the boss . ”
37498	37556	37490	37490	She	955	“ Men have been getting ahead using the old boy ’s network for years . You have to take opportunities when you can get them . So not only ca n’t you quit , you need to go in there and tell Max that you should be working on your father ’s pitch because of your name . ”
37562	37575	37576	37576	Grace	90	“ How would that help ? That would only make everything worse . ”
37589	37594	37596	37596	her	90	“ This , as they say,”—she
37600	37608	37609	37609	I	0	air—“is a win , win , win . ”
37638	37643	37644	37644	Grace	90	“ Are you listening ? ”
37672	37688	37660	37660	I	0	“ King & Associates does the kind of work you want to do , right ? ”
37689	37692	37693	37693	I	0	“ Correct . ”
37696	37706	37693	37693	I	0	“ And they ’re good at it , right ? ”
37713	37728	37693	37693	I	0	“ Correct again . Another and you ’ll win a set of steak knives . ”
37729	37741	37742	37742	She	90	“ So , why would you leave a company like that ? ”
37750	37757	37758	37758	She	90	“ You just need to shift . ”
37768	37803	37758	37758	She	90	“ You need to shift your focus . King & Associates is the best place for underpinning capitalism , feeding corporate greed , and all the geeky stuff you do . Am I right ? ”
37816	37856	37758	37758	She	90	“ So stay there . And demand to work on the project . Because your dad is the best at what he does , so the person who lands that account is going to get huge kudos , right ? ”
37857	37866	37923	37923	she	959	“ You get the steak knives , yes . ”
37867	37906	37907	37907	I	0	“ So play this smart by sticking around . And , while you ’re at it , prove to your dad why he should have offered you a position in his company over his children who have penises . ”
37928	37940	37923	37923	she	959	“ You ’re saying I keep working at King & Associates ? ”
37950	37972	37923	37923	she	959	“ Yes , because however you got the job , you ’re there . So make the most of your opportunity . ”
37973	37984	37923	37923	she	959	“ And demand to work on my father ’s account ? ”
37985	38024	38025	38025	Grace	90	“ As you ’ll be a star if you land it , right ? And you ’re flipping the bird to your father at the same time . Like I said , it ’s all win for you . ”
38036	38043	38025	38025	Grace	90	“ Unless we lose the account . ”
38051	38062	38063	38063	she	90	“ When have you ever lost at anything you wanted ? ”
38082	38090	38091	38091	I	0	“ You did n’t need to pay , ”
38094	38106	38091	38091	I	0	“ I did n’t . That was courtesy of my daddy . ”
38107	38117	38118	38118	I	0	“ Thank you , Mr. and Mrs. Park Avenue , ”
38122	38190	38118	38118	I	0	“ You might be on to something about not quitting . This could be my opportunity to prove to my father that I can do more than stay at home and lunch for the rest of my life . I ’ll show him that I ’m worth more , and that he should have been begging for me to work for him and his stupid investment bank . ”
38197	38210	38191	38191	I	0	“ Yes . That ’s exactly what I ’m going to do . ”
38228	38234	38191	38191	I	0	“ You ’re a genius . ”
38288	38294	38295	38295	I	0	“ I ’ll do it , ”
38304	38309	38298	38298	Max	74	“ Harper , hi . ”
38323	38337	38310	38310	He	74	“ I wanted to speak to you earlier , but you ran off . ”
38408	38417	38418	38418	he	74	“ I think you ’d better come in , ”
38453	38459	38443	38443	He	74	“ I said come in . ”
38512	38517	38518	38518	he	74	“ You ’re drunk , ”
38554	38558	38559	38559	I	0	“ A little , ”
38562	38581	38582	38582	he	74	“ Why did you run off ? You ’re not quitting , if that ’s what you think , ”
38593	38600	38601	38601	I	0	“ Tell me when you knew , ”
38612	38615	38616	38616	he	74	“ Knew ? ”
38626	38632	38633	38633	He	74	“ Who my father was . ”
38652	38686	38687	38687	He	74	“ I swear to you , I found out today . I think Donna assumed there was a connection but she did n’t mention it to me until I got the phone call . ”
38710	38718	38690	38690	his	74	“ Why did n’t you say anything ? ”
38730	38749	38750	38750	I	0	“ I do n’t speak to my father . I do n’t have anything to do with him . ”
38756	38793	38750	38750	I	0	“ Okay . Well you do n’t have to work on the pitch . I just thought . . . JD Stanley is the only investment bank on Wall Street I ’ve never done business with . ”
38794	38797	38798	38798	I	0	“ So , ”
38806	38816	38802	38802	I	0	“ Well I ca n’t turn down the opportunity . ”
38817	38828	38829	38829	He	74	“ I do n’t want you to turn it down . ”
38834	38852	38831	38831	his	74	“ I want you to win that fucking account — and I ’m going to help you . ”
38853	38859	38860	38860	My	0	“ What changed your mind ? ”
38866	38878	38879	38879	He	74	“ It does n’t matter . You got what you want . ”

38922	38932	38916	38916	I	0	“ He has a lot of kids , right ? ”
38940	38964	38933	38933	His	74	“ I ’m the only girl . . . and the only one he did n’t offer a job right out of college . ”
38965	38982	38983	38983	I	0	“ Because you ’re a girl ? Or because you do n’t speak to each other ? ”
39008	39013	39002	39002	Max	74	“ Come with me . ”
39065	39080	39091	39091	He	74	“ I ’m sorry . It ’s late . I should n’t be here . ”
39081	39090	39091	39091	He	74	“ Shhh . Let ’s get you hydrated . ”
39157	39160	39161	39161	he	74	“ Drink , ”
39199	39202	39203	39203	he	74	“ More , ”
39239	39255	39225	39225	He	74	“ Tell me about your dad . You think he did n’t hire you because — ”
39256	39262	39263	39263	He	74	“ Because I have boobs . ”
39268	39271	39265	39265	his	74	“ Really ? ”
39272	39282	39283	39283	I	0	“ He offered me a big chunk of money . ”
39289	39306	39265	39265	his	74	“ It ’s not that he denies my existence — he periodically asks me to dinner . ”
39307	39315	39265	39265	his	74	“ So you do speak to him ? ”
39322	39360	39361	39361	Max	74	“ Not since my youngest half brother started his job at JD Stanley the day of his twenty - second birthday . Three weeks after I graduated business school . But not really much before that either . ”

39438	39451	39452	39452	His	74	“ I like to listen . You have a lot to say . ”

39753	39761	39762	39762	He	74	“ We should focus on the pitch . ”
39785	39822	39776	39776	I	0	“ If my dad suspected . . . I need to show him I ’m excellent at my job , not that I got to work at King & Associates because I ’m fucking the boss . ”

40206	40234	40196	40196	he	74	“ If I only get to have you for one more night , I need a memory of that pretty mouth of yours wrapped around my cock . ”
40263	40273	40250	40250	he	74	“ You ca n’t just demand a blow job . ”
40310	40317	40301	40301	His	74	“ It seems to be working . ”
40421	40424	40425	40425	he	74	“ Really ? ”

42100	42146	42085	42085	I	0	“ We have less than three weeks . You guys know how much working with JD Stanley would mean to King & Associates , and to me personally . Now that we finally have our shot , we ’re going to throw everything at it . ”
42294	42343	42344	42344	I	0	“ We need to divide our time carefully . First we work out what we know about JD Stanley , Jayne , and the other executives in the business . I want to know everything from what they fed their dogs for breakfast to their mistresses middle names . ”
42415	42452	42405	42405	Her	999	“ Then we look at their trading history . I want to understand what they react to , why they invest where they do , why they prefer certain products over others . Look for patterns . ”
42459	42492	42455	42455	his	75	“ I ’ve started some of the stuff on their investment history and product preference . Just in my spare time . I knew we ’d have this moment at some point . ”
42526	42550	42520	42520	He	75	“ Good . Jim and Harper , you work together on the more personal stuff . Use the agency if you need to . ”
42611	42623	42624	42624	Harper	74	“ I may have some useful insights about their investment decisions , ”
42651	42679	42686	42686	she	1002	“ But I ’ve also been tracking their investments for the last five years and noticed some interesting choices . I ’d be happy to share these . ”
42702	42720	42686	42686	she	1002	“ I ’d like to work with Marvin on that , too , if that ’s okay ? ”

42797	42840	42841	42841	Heads	149	“ Let ’s meet at seven thirty each morning to update the team . I want us to start thinking propositions , looking for angles . This is n’t research for research ’s sake . We do n’t want analysis paralysis here . ”
42847	42889	42841	42841	Heads	149	“ We also need to determine our method of presentation . Do we do PowerPoint ? Is it likely to be in an auditorium or boardroom ? Talk to your contacts . We need more information than we have , people . ”
42890	42899	42900	42900	Harper	74	“ You should request a preliminary lunch meeting , ”
42908	42930	42900	42900	Harper	74	“ Call his assistant personally . Tell her you want to take him to La Grenouille . It ’s his favorite . ”
42961	42971	42972	42972	She	1006	“ You do n’t think that ’s too pushy ? ”
42977	43008	42974	42974	her	1006	“ He does n’t understand the concept of too pushy . He ’ll be testing your mettle . He did n’t give you much information about your meeting , right ? ”
43009	43012	43013	43013	I	0	“ Nothing , ”
43016	43044	43013	43013	I	0	“ He ’s trying to send you on a wild - goose chase . Do n’t waste time . Take control . Ask him what he wants . ”
43055	43070	43051	43051	she	1006	“ Donna , put some time in my calendar for me to do that . ”
43104	43130	43131	43131	I	0	“ And then in terms of who ’s presenting , that will be me and Harper . We ’ll need plenty of time to rehearse . ”

43166	43180	43163	43163	she	1006	“ Of course I want to , but — I’ve never pitched before . ”
43214	43225	43197	43197	She	1006	“ Donna , what pitches do we have coming up ? ”
43226	43237	43238	43238	she	1006	“ We have the Asia - Pac for Goldman ’s , ”
43241	43247	43238	43238	she	1006	“ A week from Wednesday . ”
43248	43282	43197	43197	She	1006	“ Good . Harper , get read into that . You can be my second chair in that meeting . Give you some experience . I can make a final decision after that . ”
43283	43287	43288	43288	she	1006	“ Goldman Sachs ? ”
43291	43308	43288	43288	she	1006	“ Yes . They ’re looking for someone to help them with a project in Asia . ”
43309	43312	43317	43317	her	1006	“ Okay . ”

43591	43602	43603	43603	Amanda	81	“ You ca n’t just ban me from wearing makeup , ”
43663	43676	43677	43677	Scarlett	128	“ I ’m sure he ’s not saying no makeup at all , ”
43801	43815	43788	43799	the women who seemed to drift in and out of my life	1031	“ Are you saying that I ca n’t wear any makeup , Dad ? ”
43816	43823	43824	43824	Scarlett	128	“ Of course he ’s not . ”
43912	43920	43921	43921	I	0	“ I ’ll speak to your mother , ”
43931	43941	43942	43942	Scarlett	128	“ We ’re not having pasta , are we ? ”
43945	43954	43942	43942	Scarlett	128	“ You just watched me make the sauce . ”
43955	43976	43977	43977	I	0	“ I was n’t watching . I was talking . You know I ’m not eating wheat at the moment . ”
43992	44004	43990	43990	Scarlett	128	“ Why would I know that you ’re not eating wheat ? ”
44005	44021	43990	43990	Scarlett	128	“ Because I ’ve been whining about it non - stop for the last month . ”
44022	44036	44037	44037	Amanda	81	“ Come on , Dad . You know she ’s not eating wheat , ”
44092	44099	44100	44100	I	0	“ So do n’t eat it , ”
44103	44112	44100	44100	I	0	“ I have some popsicles in the freezer . ”
44126	44140	44115	44115	her	128	“ I ’m not five . I ca n’t have popsicles for dinner . ”
44141	44150	44151	44151	I	0	“ Good . So you ’ll eat spaghetti , ”
44160	44166	44167	44167	she	128	“ We ’ll go out , ”
44170	44180	44181	44181	She	128	“ You ’ve just watched me make spaghetti sauce . ”
44184	44216	44217	44217	Unbelievable	152	“ It ’ll freeze . Come on , Amanda . Get your shoes on . We can go to that place on the corner . I like the sea bass there . ”
44225	44228	44223	44223	I	0	“ jump , ”
44335	44350	44351	44351	Amanda	81	“ Tomorrow , can we go back to the store we tried last time ? ”
44354	44365	44351	44351	Amanda	81	“ The one where I hated everything you tried on ? ”
44393	44434	44435	44435	Amanda	81	“ I met a lady in the laundry room the other day . She gave me an idea about a dress I think you ’d like , and I think I saw some that might be similar at that store , ”
44438	44443	44444	44444	I	0	“ The laundry room ? ”
44465	44472	44456	44456	I	0	“ Yeah . The other day . ”
44473	44480	44481	44481	I	0	“ Why were you doing laundry ? ”
44505	44514	44515	44515	Amanda	81	“ Sometimes girls just need to do laundry , ”
44670	44673	44674	44674	Amanda	81	“ Harper ! ”
44690	44702	44703	44703	She	81	“ Dad , this is who I was telling you about . ”
44721	44727	44718	44718	she	81	“ In the laundry room . ”
44747	44754	44755	44755	Scarlett	128	“ There ’s plenty of room , ”
44770	44779	44780	44780	Scarlett	128	“ Hey , we met the other day , ”
44802	44810	44811	44811	Amanda	81	“ Harper , this is my dad , ”
44814	44821	44811	44811	Amanda	81	“ Dad , this is Harper . ”
44843	44855	44840	44840	I	0	“ Yes , I know Harper . She works for me . ”
44861	44885	44856	44856	Amanda	81	“ She does ? Well that makes sense . She ’s smart . I told you she had some good ideas about dresses . ”
44890	44899	44900	44900	I	0	“ You ’re right . She is smart , ”
44975	44980	44981	44981	Amanda	81	“ This is perfect , ”
44984	44993	44981	44981	Amanda	81	“ Like Scarlett says , it ’s fate . ”
44994	45020	45021	45021	Scarlett	128	“ You should n’t listen to everything your aunt says . Use the eighty - twenty rule . I ’ve told you about this before . ”
45043	45053	45054	45054	Harper	74	“ Harper , this is my sister , Scarlett . ”
45065	45071	45072	45072	she	128	“ Nice to see you , ”
45075	45099	45100	45100	Harper	74	“ You poor thing , having to work with my brother . I expect he ’s a total tyrant , is n’t he ? ”
45106	45115	45103	45103	Scarlett	128	“ She ’s got you pegged , brother . ”
45116	45131	45132	45132	Amanda	81	“ He ’s not a tyrant . He lets me have anything I want , ”
45135	45186	45187	45187	Amanda	81	“ I may not be a tyrant , Amanda , but neither am I an idiot who can be easily manipulated by flattery . I do not , and will not , let you go to your eighth grade dance dressed like a twenty - five - year - old . ”
45191	45199	45200	45200	She	81	“ That ’s why this is perfect . ”
45207	45213	45205	45205	Harper	74	“ Are you busy tomorrow ? ”
45234	45249	45250	45250	She	81	“ You do n’t make her work on a Saturday , right , Dad ? ”
45271	45323	45263	45263	her	81	“ Pretty please , will you come shopping with us tomorrow ? We can find one of those dresses we saw online . And I have n’t even begun to find shoes . Please ? If I ’m on my own with dad , he ’ll have me go in sneakers — ”
45344	45357	45358	45358	I	0	“ Amanda , you ca n’t just impose on people like that , ”
45361	45389	45358	45358	I	0	“ Harper does n’t want to spend her free time schlepping around New York trying to find you a dress . And Scarlett ’s coming with us . ”
45411	45425	45426	45426	Scarlett	128	“ I told you I ca n’t come tomorrow , did n’t I ? ”
45429	45447	45426	45426	Scarlett	128	“ I have to get the first train back because I ’m taking Pablo to the vet . ”
45448	45451	45452	45452	Scarlett	128	“ Seriously ? ”
45478	45481	45482	45482	Scarlett	128	“ Sorry , ”
45485	45513	45482	45482	Scarlett	128	“ I thought I told you . The vet called me this morning . He has n’t had one of the injections he was meant to have . ”
45531	45558	45559	45559	she	128	“ There ’s no point in going tomorrow if Scarlett ’s not there and I ca n’t ask Harper . We ’ll just end up fighting , ”
45562	45568	45569	45569	Scarlett	128	“ It will be fine , ”
45578	45590	45572	45572	I	0	“ Come on . We ’ll find something , I promise . ”
45621	45647	45608	45608	Harper	74	“ Please , Harper ? Come with us ? I promise I ’ll take no more than an hour . Just two stores , maximum . ”
45665	45671	45672	45672	I	0	“ Come on , Amanda , ”
45681	45689	45672	45672	I	0	“ I ’m sure Harper ’s busy . ”
45695	45700	45701	45701	She	1061	“ I ’m sorry . ”
45706	45734	45703	45703	her	1061	“ It ’s fine . . . I . . . want you to have a great dress and I have a couple of hours tomorrow morning . ”
45735	45739	45740	45740	Amanda	81	“ You do ? ”
45746	45751	45742	45742	her	81	“ You ’ll come ? ”
45806	45809	45810	45810	I	0	“ Amanda , ”
45813	45829	45810	45810	I	0	“ You ca n’t expect people to just drop everything and do whatever you want . ”
45830	45834	45835	45835	she	81	“ Why not ? ”
45838	45842	45835	45835	she	81	“ You do . ”
45852	45865	45866	45866	She	81	“ I do n’t mind . Honestly . We ’ll have fun . ”
45871	45882	45866	45866	She	81	“ But now I have to go to the gym . ”
45890	45899	45883	45883	Amanda	81	“ And you wo n’t change your mind ? ”
45900	45907	45908	45908	Harper	74	“ If she does , then — ”
45913	45929	45908	45908	Harper	74	“ I wo n’t change my mind . I promise . Have a good night . ”
46124	46160	46170	46170	her	90	“ I ’m cured . I ’ve been dreaming about his penis and just like that , it ’s gone . Any attraction I had to him has just disappeared because I never knew him . ”
46161	46166	46167	46167	Grace	90	“ Just like that ? ”
46174	46228	46170	46170	her	90	“ I ’m serious . I ca n’t find someone attractive who had a daughter who was n’t important enough to tell me about , who was n’t man enough to marry the woman he knocked up . I ’ve lived my entire life with the consequences of that kind of selfish behavior . ”
46402	46423	46399	46400	Poor Amanda	81	“ But Max is n’t your dad . I mean , when did Charles Jayne ever take you dress shopping ? ”
46439	46472	46473	46473	I	0	“ So he has his daughter on the weekend occasionally — doesn’t mean he wants his kid around . Looked like his sister was the one who was looking after her anyway . ”
46476	46513	46473	46473	I	0	“ But this is a good thing . It was n’t as if I enjoyed being attracted to Max — I hated the fact that I ’d slept with my boss . Now I ’m cured . ”
46662	46695	46696	46696	Grace	90	“ I still do n’t get why you just stopped wanting to jump his bones because you found out he was a father . Most women would find that at turn on , ”
46699	46723	46696	46696	Grace	90	“ Yeah , well , I ’m not most women . And I doubt he ’s winning father of the year anytime soon . ”
46906	46915	46916	46916	Grace	90	“ So no more sleeping with the boss ? ”
46919	46955	46916	46916	Grace	90	“ Definitely no more sleeping with the boss . I ’m not having my father find out and assume that the only reason I got the job was because I looked good on my back . ”
46968	46981	46916	46916	Grace	90	“ I thought you said you did n’t find Max attractive anymore . ”
46982	46987	47061	47064	the art gallery guy	1095	“ I do n’t . ”
46988	47005	47061	47064	the art gallery guy	1095	“ So if you still found him attractive , you ’d still be sleeping with him ? ”
47006	47032	46916	46916	Grace	90	“ Why are you giving me such a hard time , Anderson Cooper ? I have more than one reason not to sleep with him . ”
47033	47044	47045	47045	My	0	“ Does that mean you ’re going to call George ? ”
47066	47069	47061	47064	the art gallery guy	1095	“ Maybe . ”
47070	47078	47079	47079	I	0	“ He said you took his number . ”
47105	47108	47095	47095	I	0	“ Harper , ”
47127	47132	47133	47133	I	0	“ Got ta go , ”
47311	47316	47317	47317	Amanda	81	“ Do you agree ? ”
47363	47372	47373	47373	he	74	“ I think it ’s going to rain , ”
47376	47379	47373	47373	he	74	“ Dad . ”
47397	47405	47380	47380	She	81	“ Do you agree about the dress ? ”
47406	47418	47373	47373	he	74	“ I ’m not committing to anything until I see it . ”
47419	47435	47436	47436	Max	74	“ Well , if we do n’t find something today , I ’m going naked . ”
47439	47469	47436	47436	Max	74	“ If you were a couple of years older , I might worry . Right now , I think your teenage angst is my insurance policy against that happening . ”
47470	47480	47481	47481	she	81	“ I do n’t understand what you just said , ”
47484	47497	47481	47481	she	81	“ And so that ’s a double win for me , peanut . ”
47517	47520	47521	47521	he	74	“ Sorry , ”
47576	47581	47582	47582	Amanda	81	“ Here we are , ”
47602	47610	47611	47611	Max	74	“ It ’s definitely going to rain , ”
47694	47699	47700	47700	Amanda	81	“ What about this ? ”
47719	47726	47716	47716	I	0	“ We should definitely try it . ”
47759	47773	47774	47774	I	0	“ We can do shoes and a bag once we get the dress , ”
47812	47841	47796	47796	I	0	“ Harper , will you stay there while I change so you can see it before my dad ? I want to surprise him with the perfect choice . ”
47842	47846	47847	47847	I	0	“ Of course , ”
47859	47870	47847	47847	I	0	“ Which one are you going to try on first ? ”
47871	47880	47881	47881	she	81	“ The purple one . Uh - oh , ”
47884	47895	47881	47881	she	81	“ My dad is n’t going to like this one . ”
47967	47976	47977	47977	I	0	“ I do n’t think it suits you , ”
48004	48045	47977	47977	I	0	“ People say that you should wear the dress , the dress should n’t wear you . Now I ’m not sure what that means , but I think we ’re in dangerous territory . What about the shorter one ? ”
48075	48081	48082	48082	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
48087	48096	48097	48097	she	81	“ I think my dad would like it , ”
48124	48140	48141	48141	I	0	“ But I think I want to look more . . . grown - up . ”
48192	48224	48225	48225	She	81	“ Try the royal blue one . I think it would look great against your black hair , and silver accessories would go beautifully with it . It ’s more sophisticated . ”
48243	48249	48250	48250	she	81	“ Would you wear it ? ”
48264	48284	48261	48261	I	0	“ Yes . It ’s beautiful . Not that I would have anywhere to wear a dress like that . ”
48296	48301	48302	48302	she	81	“ On a date ? ”
48305	48313	48302	48302	she	81	“ Do you have a boyfriend yet ? ”
48353	48361	48348	48348	Max	74	“ No , not at the moment . ”
48362	48390	48348	48348	Max	74	“ You ’re super pretty . When I ’m older , I want to love my job , but I want someone to love me , too . ”
48416	48446	48406	48406	Grace	90	“ My dad ’s like you . Always busy with work . He always says that between work and me , he has more than enough for any man . ”
48485	48493	48494	48494	I	0	“ Do you hang out a lot ? ”
48501	48514	48515	48515	she	90	“ Me and my dad ? Yeah . Like all the time , ”

48634	48652	48668	48668	he	74	“ And it looks gorgeous against your hair . Let me grab some shoes . Stay there . ”
48675	48680	48681	48681	he	74	“ Everything all right ? ”
48687	48693	48684	48684	I	0	“ Just getting some shoes . ”
48713	48731	48708	48708	he	74	“ Sorry . I just wanted to say thank you . This means a lot to Amanda . ”
48852	48863	48864	48864	she	81	“ Will he like it ? Can we convince him ? ”
48875	48883	48864	48864	she	81	“ This is the one , right ? ”
48884	48902	48936	48936	Her	81	“ You know him better than I do , but I think you look beautiful in it . ”
48903	48906	48907	48907	she	81	“ Daaad , ”
48911	48935	48907	48907	she	81	“ I ’m coming out . And I really like this one . It ’s perfect , so you ca n’t be mean . ”

49034	49045	49017	49017	He	74	“ I think you look far too grown - up . ”
49051	49056	49057	49057	He	74	“ And completely beautiful . ”
49064	49072	49073	49073	He	74	“ You found your dress , peanut . ”

49165	49171	49172	49172	he	74	“ Twirl for me again , ”
49248	49255	49256	49256	Amanda	81	“ You know what this means ? ”
49303	49314	49315	49315	Max	74	“ We let poor Harper get on with her weekend ? ”
49369	49381	49354	49354	Amanda	81	“ No silly . It means we have something to celebrate . ”

49598	49616	49595	49595	Max	74	“ Amanda , Harper has things to do . We have imposed on her free time enough . ”
49681	49723	49676	49676	Amanda	81	“ I do n’t want to celebrate without her . If it had n’t been for Harper , I would n’t have found my dress . Are you sure you ca n’t come ? We ’re going to my favorite place . ”
49755	49773	49747	49747	he	74	“ I ’m sure your dad wants to switch off from work and spend time with you — ”
49774	49777	49778	49778	Amanda	81	“ Daaad , ”
49781	49792	49778	49778	Amanda	81	“ You want Harper to come , do n’t you ? ”
49842	49884	49825	49825	his	74	“ Harper , we ’d love for you to come if you can spare the time . But do n’t feel you have to give into my daughter ’s whining . She ’s far too used to getting her own way . ”
49908	49926	49927	49927	I	0	“ I suppose I should have asked before I said yes , but where are we celebrating ? ”
49934	49937	49938	49938	Amanda	81	“ Serendipity , ”
49941	49966	49938	49938	Amanda	81	“ It ’s our place . We always come in on the train at the end of summer and celebrate going back to school . ”
49967	49973	49974	49974	I	0	“ From your mom ’s ? ”
49977	50006	50007	50007	she	81	“ From Connecticut . Sometimes my mom and Jason come , but sometimes we come in together . Do you remember that year Aunt Scarlett came as well ? ”
50012	50026	50007	50007	she	81	“ She wanted to order one of everything because she could n’t decide . ”
50027	50035	50036	50036	Max	74	“ She did order one of everything , ”
50039	50048	50036	50036	Max	74	“ Which is pretty typical of my sister . ”
50049	50066	50067	50067	She	81	“ My mom and Jason moved to Europe so it ’s just me and Dad now . ”
50074	50090	50067	50067	She	81	“ You love having me living with you all the time , do n’t you ? ”
50098	50105	50091	50091	Max	74	“ She ’s driving me crazy . ”
50110	50120	50121	50121	I	0	“ I did n’t realize you lived in Connecticut , ”
50156	50183	50145	50147	an investigative journalist	1164	“ Yeah , near Mom and Jason ’s place . And Grandma and Grandpa King and Grand - Bob and Grand - Mary . And Scarlett . ”
50184	50201	50202	50202	Max	74	“ Jesus . It makes us sound like we ’re living in some kind of commune . ”
50212	50251	50252	50252	he	74	“ We just all live close . Amanda ’s mother , Pandora , and I were in high school together , and it made sense after college to make sure we lived near each other . That way , ”
50259	50279	50252	50252	he	74	“ when your mother got sick of you , she could get a break and dump you with me . ”
50297	50310	50311	50311	I	0	“ So the apartment is just a pied - à - terre ? ”
50317	50349	50314	50314	He	74	“ Yeah . I used to stay in Manhattan all week and go back to the country on weekends , but now I ’m only in town two nights a week . ”
50360	50387	50350	50350	Amanda	81	“ Oh my God . You ’ll have to come out , Harper . The night of the dance . Will you help me get ready ? ”
50451	50471	50441	50441	his	74	“ Amanda . That ’s enough . You ca n’t just assume people want to be monopolized by you . ”
50479	50502	50441	50441	his	74	“ Why not ? Grandma says that I get all my charm from her and that God skipped a generation with you . ”
50523	50544	50545	50545	she	81	“ Oh , I meant to say that I ’ve decided I want to enter that piano competition next semester , ”
50548	50575	50576	50576	Max	74	“ I thought we checked a few months ago and you have gymnastics the night of the practice , or will the schedule change next semester ? ”
50634	50664	50617	50617	he	74	“ Well , gymnastics is at six and then piano is at eight . So I think I can do both if we can get Marion to drive me . ”
50731	50741	50742	50742	Max	74	“ I told you it was going to rain , ”
50745	50749	50742	50742	Max	74	“ Come on . ”
50808	50814	50815	50815	Amanda	81	“ Come on , Harper , ”
50839	50852	50825	50825	Amanda	81	“ One banana , two banana , three banana , four banana . ”
50861	50869	50858	50858	Amanda	81	“ Quick , it ’s nearly here . ”
50903	50909	50910	50910	I	0	“ Let ’s get inside , ”
50927	50938	50939	50939	Amanda	81	“ Do I look like a drowned rat , Dad ? ”
50976	50981	50973	50973	Max	74	“ A little bit . ”
50996	51006	51007	51007	I	0	“ I ’m sure I look like Alice Cooper , ”
51010	51023	51024	51024	Amanda	81	“ You look very pretty , like from a movie or something , ”
51027	51034	51024	51024	Amanda	81	“ Does n’t she , Dad ? ”
51135	51144	51145	51145	he	74	“ Not as pretty as my drowned rat , ”
51148	51164	51145	51145	he	74	“ Gah . That ’s why I ’m never going to get a baby sister . ”
51171	51188	51145	51145	he	74	“ You need to learn to give ladies compliments , or you ’ll never get married . ”
51340	51348	51349	51349	Amanda	81	“ We could invite Harper to dinner , ”
51366	51375	51352	51352	she	81	“ Maybe . . . at some point . ”
51393	51410	51388	51388	I	0	“ Well it will be the dance soon anyway . Harper will come then for sure . ”
51517	51522	51526	51526	Violet	134	“ Who ’s Harper , ”
51549	51568	51530	51530	I	0	“ I told you , the girl that works with dad who helped me pick out the dress . ”
51569	51582	51583	51583	Violet	134	“ I thought a friend of yours had gone shopping with you , ”
51603	51611	51612	51612	Amanda	81	“ She is a friend of mine , ”
51615	51628	51612	51612	Amanda	81	“ She lives in the same building in the city as dad . ”
51629	51637	51641	51641	she	134	“ And she works with your father ? ”
51668	51676	51677	51677	She	134	“ That seems like a strange coincidence . ”
51682	51703	51679	51679	her	134	“ You see a pretty girl in the corridor of your building and offer her a job sharpening your pencils ? ”
51704	51710	51711	51711	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , ”
51734	51737	51730	51730	Amanda	81	“ Scarlett ! ”

51828	51836	51822	51822	she	128	“ Nice to see you , too . ”
51851	51864	51865	51865	Scarlett	128	“ I ’m serious . Why did n’t you call me back ? ”
51868	51871	51872	51872	I	0	“ When ? ”
51883	51896	51897	51897	Scarlett	128	“ I left you a voicemail telling you about my friend April , ”
51912	51927	51900	51900	she	128	“ She asked me to fix you two up , although God knows why . ”
51928	51936	51900	51900	she	128	“ I did n’t get the message . ”
51958	51961	51949	51949	she	128	“ Sorry . ”
51962	51965	51966	51966	she	128	“ So ? ”

52026	52034	52035	52035	she	128	“ So will you take her out ? ”
52075	52083	52084	52084	Violet	134	“ Looks like April may have competition , ”
52096	52118	52093	52093	Violet	134	“ We ’ve been talking a lot about Harper this evening . She ’d definitely get Amanda ’s seal of approval . ”
52191	52209	52182	52182	Harper	74	“ April comes from a lovely family . She ’s blonde , which I know you like . ”
52355	52362	52363	52363	Violet	134	“ What are you smiling about ? ”
52367	52375	52363	52363	Violet	134	“ I ’m not smiling about anything . ”
52491	52499	52500	52500	Amanda	81	“ Can I show them my dress ? ”
52503	52512	52500	52500	Amanda	81	“ After dinner you can try it on . ”
52513	52546	52579	52579	she	81	“ Daddy bought me the most beautiful shoes to go with it . I ’m not sure he would have , but Harper said she ’d buy them if he did n’t . ”
52547	52571	52579	52579	she	81	“ I was always going to buy the shoes . Give me some credit . I know you ca n’t wear your sneakers . ”
52618	52628	52629	52629	Scarlett	128	“ So I want to hear more about Harper , ”
52632	52642	52629	52629	Scarlett	128	“ How old is she ? Is she pretty ? ”

52734	52743	52744	52744	Scarlett	128	“ I ’d say about twenty - five , ”
52747	52761	52744	52744	Scarlett	128	“ Gorgeous , too , and she just happens to work with Max . ”
52785	52822	52769	52769	she	128	“ She ’s one of my employees who happens to live in the building . Amanda begged her to go shopping with her . I ’m sure it ’s the last thing she wanted to do . ”
52823	52828	52829	52829	Amanda	81	“ She enjoyed it , ”
52870	52890	52891	52891	Amanda	81	“ Would she go out on a date with your dad , or is she too pretty for him ? ”
52894	52915	52891	52891	Amanda	81	“ Oh my God , that would be so awesome . And I know she does n’t have a boyfriend . ”

53287	53308	53309	53309	she	161	“ You ’re right , he does n’t have much time to do anything , so how can I help ? ”
53312	53343	53309	53309	she	161	“ I want to make the presentation as focused and helpful as possible . Now of course this benefits me because I provide Mr. Jayne with what he most needs . ”

53360	53367	53351	53351	she	161	“ Please , call me Max . ”

53389	53442	53309	53309	she	161	“ I want to create a win - win situation . If I understand what it is that Mr. Jayne is looking for then our presentation wo n’t be a waste of anyone ’s time . He ’s happy . I ’m happy . If I can get lunch with Mr. Jayne — ”
53443	53471	53472	53472	Her	161	“ The problem is he does n’t have any lunch availability between now and the twenty - fourth . His schedule books up very quickly , unfortunately . ”
53505	53530	53531	53531	I	0	“ I ’d be very happy to come to the JD Stanley offices and bring lunch to Mr. Jayne , if that would help ? ”
53534	53552	53531	53531	I	0	“ Alternatively , I ’ll get a table booked at La Grenouille if that would suit him . ”
53553	53580	53590	53590	she	161	“ I ’m sorry . If it were up to me , I ’d love to find space . But I ’m afraid it ’s not . ”
53605	53612	53594	53594	she	161	“ That ’s such a shame . ”
53790	53805	53806	53806	I	0	“ I ’d hoped he ’d enjoy seeing his daughter in a professional environment , ”
53822	53844	53806	53806	I	0	“ I was assuming Harper Jayne would join us for lunch . But I understand that Mr. Jayne is very busy . ”

58006	58023	58024	58024	Max	74	“ I was lucky to recruit someone so talented . She ’s smart and works hard . ”
58027	58045	58046	58046	he	74	“ I ’m just grateful you were n’t successful in convincing her to work for JD Stanley , ”
58087	58117	58140	58140	he	74	“ But to answer your question , I had no idea she was your daughter until after our telephone conversation . It ’s not something she ’s ever mentioned . ”
58118	58121	58122	58122	he	74	“ Really ? ”

58397	58428	58393	58394	my father	239	“ Absolutely not . I know that when you see our work , understand what we can do for you , then the reason you called wo n’t matter anymore . ”

58825	58850	58851	58851	I	0	“ May I ask why you ’re thinking about outsourcing some of your research at this point ? Has something changed at your end ? ”
58881	58923	58877	58878	My father	239	“ Well , I think it ’s good to keep the people who work for you on their toes , and I ’ve been following what you do and I thought I ’d like to hear a little more about it . ”

60183	60208	60209	60209	He	74	“ And I ’m sorry about the shoes . They ’re beautiful and I love them . Sometimes I do n’t accept gifts well . ”
60212	60218	60209	60209	He	74	“ Can I ask why ? ”

60638	60649	60650	60650	He	74	“ About the way you feel when I touch you . ”
60670	60687	60688	60688	He	74	“ About how you need me to fuck you more than you need your next breath . ”

63408	63442	63403	63403	she	1396	“ I agreed to come shopping because I assumed Amanda would be miserable going shopping with you . I assumed you took as much interest in Amanda as my father did in me . ”
63452	63455	63456	63456	I	0	“ Really ? ”
63459	63489	63456	63456	I	0	“ She loves shopping . Does n’t mind who she ’s with but I like to take her . I think since Pandora left , she misses . . . ”

63586	63611	63578	63578	she	1396	“ She loved having you there . Did n’t stop going on about you when we got home — it certainly raised some eyebrows . ”
63612	63616	63617	63617	she	1396	“ It did ? ”
63620	63626	63617	63617	she	1396	“ What kind of eyebrows ? ”
63627	63653	63656	63656	they	1410	“ The busybody kind . I guess because we work together and live in the same building . I think my sisters believed . . . ”
63664	63671	63672	63672	she	1396	“ Is Violet younger than you ? ”
63686	63709	63678	63678	she	1396	“ Yes , and a complete pain in the ass . Always interfering in everyone ’s business . She ’s a meddler . ”

64520	64525	64526	64526	I	0	“ You are perfect , ”
64596	64610	64611	64611	I	0	“ I want you on your back , your feet in the air , ”

65659	65662	65663	65663	I	0	“ Amanda , ”
65695	65699	65700	65700	she	101	“ In here , ”
65769	65777	65778	65778	Scarlett	128	“ Can I have one of those ? ”
65784	65787	65778	65778	Scarlett	128	“ Hey . ”
65793	65800	65801	65801	She	101	“ What are you doing here ? ”
65808	65825	65801	65801	She	101	“ I did n’t want to be on my own tonight . Can I stay over ? ”
65848	65858	65859	65859	she	101	“ I ’m thinking of moving into the city , ”
65873	65896	65897	65897	she	101	“ Sometimes it feels like Connecticut is where I should be in ten years rather than now . Does that make sense ? ”
65900	65926	65897	65897	she	101	“ It ’s good to change things up , I guess . You ’ve never lived in Manhattan . What would you do about work ? ”
65955	65988	65944	65944	she	101	“ I thought I ’d apply for a transfer . There ’s a treasury position in Manhattan at the moment . It ’s a level up , but I have the experience . ”
66083	66090	66069	66069	Scarlett	128	“ Anything you care to share ? ”
66101	66105	66091	66091	I	0	“ Just work . ”
66111	66119	66091	66091	I	0	“ Yeah , that looked like work . ”
66246	66251	66252	66252	Amanda	81	“ Hey , Dad , ”
66259	66264	66265	66265	I	0	“ Hey , beautiful , ”
66314	66322	66323	66323	Scarlett	128	“ You going to text Harper back ? ”
66365	66369	66370	66370	Amanda	81	“ Harper texted ? ”
66374	66402	66370	66370	Amanda	81	“ Can you ask her if she ’ll come help me get ready for the dance ? I want her to do my eyeliner just like hers . ”
66412	66438	66403	66403	I	0	“ No , I ’m not asking Harper to come out to Connecticut to help you get ready . She ’s not your personal stylist . ”
66439	66458	66459	66459	Scarlett	128	“ She ’s too busy attending to someone else ’s needs in this family , is n’t she ? ”
66469	66472	66473	66473	Amanda	81	“ What ? ”
66476	66490	66491	66491	I	0	“ Let ’s talk about your dating life , shall we , Scarlett ? ”
66499	66514	66494	66494	She	128	“ Oh , so you admit Harper ’s part of your dating life then ? ”
66533	66538	66539	66539	I	0	“ Have you eaten ? ”
66549	66558	66539	66539	I	0	“ Tell me more about Harper , Amanda . ”
66563	66583	66584	66584	Amanda	81	“ I want to be just like her when I ’m older . You ’ve seen her , right ? ”
66625	66630	66631	66631	I	0	“ So , dinner ? ”
66643	66653	66654	66654	Amanda	81	“ Can I have the cold lasagna in there ? ”
66677	66686	66687	66687	Amanda	81	“ Harper ’s great , is n’t she ? ”
66704	66713	66690	66690	I	0	“ Do you think she likes your dad ? ”
66714	66717	66718	66718	I	0	“ Scarlett , ”
66721	66728	66729	66729	Scarlett	128	“ Does she have a boyfriend ? ”
66752	66764	66765	66765	Amanda	81	“ No , she says she ’s too focused on work , ”
66768	66790	66765	66765	Amanda	81	“ When I talked to her , she pretty much agreed boys were douchebags who should be avoided at all costs . ”
66809	66817	66818	66818	I	0	“ She ’s a very sensible woman . ”
66826	66832	66833	66833	I	0	“ Can you get plates ? ”
66855	66866	66872	66872	her	687	“ You know we just want you to be happy , ”
66875	66887	66888	66888	She	81	“ And from what I can remember , Harper is beautiful . ”
66899	66905	66888	66888	She	81	“ Amanda clearly likes her . ”
66920	66929	66906	66906	I	0	“ Have you thought about asking her out ? ”
67005	67008	67009	67009	I	0	“ What ? ”
67025	67039	67040	67040	Amanda	81	“ Have you thought about asking Harper out on a date , Dad ? ”
67069	67093	67059	67059	I	0	“ What is with you two ? I ’ve told you , Harper works for me . What is your obsession with her ? ”
67094	67099	67100	67100	Amanda	81	“ I like her . ”
67106	67129	67103	67103	Scarlett	128	“ And that should be reason enough . Why do n’t you take her to dinner ? What could one evening hurt ? ”
67245	67254	67255	67255	I	0	“ You think I should date , huh ? ”
67298	67316	67289	67289	Amanda	81	“ Come on , Dad , duh . I ’ve only been saying this my whole life . ”
67317	67320	67321	67321	I	0	“ Okay , ”
67324	67330	67331	67331	Amanda	81	“ What does okay mean ? ”
67334	67346	67347	67347	I	0	“ It means please do n’t speak with your mouth full , ”
67360	67371	67355	67355	She	1965	“ Sorry . But what does ‘ okay ’ mean ? ”
67372	67386	67355	67355	She	1965	“ It means , okay , I ’ll think about asking her out . ”
67480	67484	67485	67485	Amanda	81	“ You will ? ”
67488	67511	67485	67485	Amanda	81	“ Does that mean she can come help me get ready for the dance ? Can I call her now to ask ? ”
67512	67534	67535	67535	Amanda	81	“ I said I ’d think about asking her to dinner , not employ her to do your makeup . Jeez . ”
67550	67566	67540	67540	she	81	“ You could make her dinner , here . After I leave for the dance . ”
67591	67598	67599	67599	I	0	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
67617	67620	67621	67621	I	0	“ What ? ”
67628	67631	67625	67625	She	128	“ Nothing . ”
67651	67683	67632	67632	Amanda	81	“ Can I call her now ? Check if she ’s free ? This is going to be so much fun . It will be like , the best night ever ! ”
67684	67692	67693	67693	I	0	“ You need to lower your expectations , ”
67698	67711	67712	67712	She	81	“ And prepare yourself for the fact that she might say no . ”
67721	67743	67712	67712	She	81	“ So what if she does ? You ’ve always told me that you do n’t take no for an answer . ”
67822	67834	67835	67835	Max	74	“ So , you ’ll handle any questions about the process ? ”
68083	68089	68090	68090	Max	74	“ Do n’t be nervous , ”
68098	68109	68090	68090	Max	74	“ It will be fine . The rehearsal was good . ”
68172	68179	68180	68180	I	0	“ Easy for you to say , ”
68183	68188	68189	68189	he	74	“ I mean it , ”
68217	68226	68227	68227	I	0	“ Sorry , I need to . . . ”
68241	68267	68268	68268	he	74	“ Okay , I get it . What if I was to ask you a favor ? Would that help take your mind off things ? ”
68284	68303	68271	68271	I	0	“ Amanda wants you to help her get ready for the dance . I said I ’d ask . ”
68314	68318	68319	68319	I	0	“ In Connecticut ? ”
68325	68354	68322	68322	He	74	“ You do n’t have to come , but I know Amanda would like you to . She suggested you and I have dinner together when she left . ”
68355	68364	68365	68365	I	0	“ Is she trying to set us up ? ”
68368	68381	68365	68365	I	0	“ I think so . She ’s a big fan of yours . ”
68385	68393	68394	68394	I	0	“ Runs in the family , apparently . ”
68442	68450	68451	68451	he	74	“ I ’d like you to come , ”
68477	68489	68467	68467	her	81	“ Is that weird , having your daughter set you up ? ”
68495	68522	68492	68492	his	74	“ It should be , I guess . But she goes on and on about me getting marrie — dating . I ’m used to it . ”
68523	68534	68546	68546	he	74	“ Have you told her that we ’re . . . ”
68535	68545	68546	68546	he	74	“ Fucking like bunnies ? Funnily enough , no , ”
68597	68613	68614	68614	he	74	“ I think maybe she ’s picked up on the fact that I like you , ”
68629	68636	68614	68614	he	74	“ I know my sister has . ”
68662	68665	68666	68666	I	0	“ Scarlett ? ”
68669	68685	68666	68666	I	0	“ Yeah , she ’s made a few comments when your name ’s come up . ”
68697	68737	68688	68688	his	74	“ Look , do n’t feel any pressure , but I ’d like it if you came up , even if it is n’t for the dance — it ’s only three weeks away . You might have plans . ”
68738	68743	68744	68744	He	74	“ I do n’t . ”
68751	68758	68759	68759	he	74	“ You do n’t have plans ? ”
68767	68777	68762	68762	I	0	“ So ? Does that mean you ’ll come ? ”
68778	68781	68782	68782	I	0	“ Sure . ”
68844	68851	68852	68852	he	74	“ Max King for Peter Jones , ”
68873	68894	68870	68870	he	74	“ I ’ve done this a million times , Harper . I ’ll step in if it gets too much . ”
68977	68982	68983	68983	I	0	“ I ’m good , ”
68992	68997	68983	68983	I	0	“ Everything ’s fine . ”
69063	69077	69078	69078	Max	74	“ Gentleman , we have some slides we ’d like to pass round , ”
69118	69227	69111	69111	his	1492	“ Why do n’t you just talk to us about the experience you have in Asia . Most of your competitors have local offices , and I ’d like to understand a little more about how you ’ll be able to provide any real value from your desks here in Manhattan . Shit . Shit . Shit . Shit . Shit . This was n’t going as planned . The presentation was where I felt safe . I glanced across at Max , who looked as relaxed as if he ’d just been asked his mother ’s maiden name . He sat back in his chair and nodded . “
69246	69299	69300	69300	You	1494	” He went on to explain how his low overheads meant he could spend money employing experts on the ground , which could be different project to project , where his competitors had to use the people they ’d employed in their local office regardless of whether or not they were qualified . “
69353	69434	69436	69436	you	0	” Max sat forward as he spoke , looking at his audience as if they were the most important people in the world and he had precious information to share with them . They seemed to find him as compelling as I did . Max batted away each of the questions as if he were Nadal returning serve , and as the meeting progressed , the suits visibly relaxed , even chuckling at a few of Max ’s wry comments . “
69449	69463	69436	69436	you	0	” The middle man tapped his fingers against the arm of his chair . “
69475	69492	69493	69493	Harper	74	” Max turned to me . This was the part of the presentation I ’d prepared . “
69503	69532	69496	69496	you	0	” I lifted the corner of my mouth , trying to fake a smile , wanting to cover the fact my mind had gone blank . Completely blank . “
69537	69551	69496	69496	you	0	” I flicked through my copy of the presentation that had gone unopened . “
69573	69621	69622	69622	We	1498	” I glanced up and scanned the three sets of eyes all staring at me . I reached for my glass of water and took a sip . My mind was blank . I ’d been over this hundreds of times , but I needed a prompt . “
69628	69661	69662	69662	I	0	” I blurted . That was one of my key points , was n’t it ? I did n’t know what I was saying . I started flicking through my presentation manically . “
69673	69682	69683	69683	Harper	74	” Max placed his hand on my forearm . “
69710	69999	70000	70000	Harper	74	” Several times Max paused and turned to me , which would have allowed me to step in and say something if only I could have thought of a single thing to say . Eventually I tuned out and slumped back in my seat . I ’d been given this huge opportunity and I ’d totally bombed . What the hell was the matter with me ? I ’d been well prepared for today . I could n’t have done more . Did I subconsciously not think I deserved to be here ? Had my father ’s comments at lunch last week burrowed deeper than I realized ? I was trying so hard to prove to my father I was worthy of this job , but I was n’t sure I really believed it . * * * * * I tried to wash away the awful meeting at Goldman Sachs but my bath was n’t helping . Nor was the Jo Malone bath oil or the so - called soothing music filtering through from my bedroom . I was trying to relax , calm down . Nothing was working . All I could do was replay the disastrous meeting earlier in the day over and over again . I slid under the water , submerging my entire head in the vain hope it would cleanse away the embarrassment . I came up for air . Nope , I still wanted to die . Max must think I ’m an idiot . My breath caught at the sharp knock at the door . Perfect timing . Here he was to tell me so . Well , I did n’t have to answer the door . I ignored him . “
70013	70040	70041	70041	I	0	” I should n’t have put that music on . I stood up and wrapped a towel around me . Max started pounding on the door . “
70045	70065	70041	70041	I	0	” I shouted . I threw it open , then immediately turned around and headed back to the bathroom . “
70073	70139	70140	70140	You	74	” he mumbled . I dropped my towel and slid back into the bath . I expected him to follow me , but instead I heard cabinet doors opening in the kitchen . What was he doing ? He appeared , barefoot , his jacket and tie gone , holding two glasses of wine . Right then he might just have been the perfect man . “
70148	70155	70140	70140	You	74	” I said . He grinned . “
70165	70250	70157	70157	I	0	” He handed me a glass , which I took gratefully . He ’d definitely brought the bottle with him — I did n’t own anything this good . It tasted like it cost a month ’s salary . He sighed , closed the bathroom door , and began unbuttoning his shirt . When he undid the last one , he took a swig of his wine and placed it on the side of the bath and stripped off the rest of his clothes . “
70256	70285	70253	70253	you	74	” I asked as he stepped into the bath . He did n’t respond , just sat down at the opposite end , pulling my legs over his . “
70290	70301	70286	70286	You	1501	” he said , taking a sip of his wine . “
70325	70347	70348	70348	You	1501	” He acted as if he had n’t heard me , stroking up the leg I had resting on his thigh . “
70353	70373	70350	70351	Michael Jordan	171	” Now he ’s going to talk about sports ? Great . Just what I needed . I nodded . “
70387	70388	70408	70408	he	171	” “
70395	70405	70408	70408	he	171	” Where the hell was he going with this ? “
70449	70459	70408	70408	he	171	” He smoothed his hands up and down my legs “
70501	70511	70512	70512	We	1504	” He paused and we stared at each other . “
70530	70544	70519	70519	We	1504	” I sighed and skimmed the top of the water with my palms . “
70556	70560	70549	70549	I	0	” I muttered . “
70605	70618	70593	70593	You	0	” He took my foot , pressing his thumbs into my sole . “
70680	70681	70684	70684	you	0	” “
70704	70718	70697	70697	you	0	” I tried to pull my leg away but he held on tight . “
70749	70768	70743	70743	they	459	” The pressure in my chest started to lift . He was right . Of course he was . “
70774	70775	70770	70770	I	0	” “
70788	70807	70779	70780	Michael Jordan	171	” I did n’t say anything . I was new and inexperienced and I ’d let it show . “
70835	70896	70897	70897	You	74	” Had he really been trying to protect me ? Warmth for him spread through my body . I was n’t used to someone having my back in such an obvious way . Not a man anyway . And I liked it . More than liked it . I pulled my foot from his hands and moved to straddle him . “
70905	70909	70897	70897	You	74	” He chuckled . “
70917	70933	70897	70897	You	74	” I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him briefly on his jaw . “
70939	70943	70934	70934	You	74	” I said . “
70951	70955	70944	70944	You	74	” he replied . “
70961	70985	70944	70944	You	74	” I whispered and I pressed my lips to his . His tongue reached for mine . He shifted , pushing me away . “
71012	71067	71003	71003	neighbors	662	” Well , I could n’t argue with that logic , either . He held me tight as he walked me out of the bathroom and pushed me onto the bed , collapsing beside me . He opened my towel as if inspecting me for clues , his eyes raking over my naked body . “
71072	71141	71068	71068	You	74	” he said , squinting as he said it , as if he could n’t quite believe it . A rush of panic hit me in the chest as I pushed my fingers through his hair . I could n’t imagine not having this , not having him , to talk to , to kiss , to fuck . What would I do when this was all over ? “
71153	71157	71142	71142	I	0	” he said . “
71170	71247	71158	71158	I	0	” He dipped his head and circled one of my nipples with his tongue . The pulling sensation in my stomach chased away the panic and I shifted my hips sideways , tangling my legs with his . His towel had fallen open and I reached for his hard , heavy cock . I shivered as I began to pump my fist up and down . He hissed through his teeth , throwing his head back . “
71263	71267	71248	71248	I	0	” he said . “
71274	71275	71268	71268	You	1511	” “
71281	71305	71268	71268	You	1511	” He reached for my pussy , and I flicked my hips up to meet his fingers , always eager for his touch . “
71318	71344	71346	71346	you	1511	” His fingers dipped inside me , his thumb pressing against my clitoris , the frustration and embarrassment of the day dissolving under his touch . “
71351	71361	71346	71346	you	1511	” he asked , slowly thrusting into my hands . “
71367	71385	71362	71362	You	1511	” He grazed my shoulder with his teeth , then bit down , causing me to moan . “
71390	71460	71362	71362	You	1511	” It was true . The only way I survived in the office was by avoiding him , but that was like trying to avoid gravity . My pull toward him was inevitable . I released his dick and he began to slide it over my sex , teasing , promising . I reached behind me for the nightstand , but he took over my search for a condom . “
71471	71475	71461	71461	I	0	” he whispered . “
71484	71494	71495	71495	I	0	” He paused in his rhythm and I whimpered . “
71506	71643	71644	71644	Max	74	” I ’d never been so sexually vulnerable with a man , never offered up so much of myself . But with him it was n’t a choice ; it was mandatory . There was no other way I could be . He slipped his palms under my ass and pulled me toward him as he sat back onto his knees , the warmth of his eyes replacing his body heat . His gaze bore into me as he thrust . He did n’t take his time , but he did n’t rush , either , just moved into me with a strong , confident force that nearly had me climaxing — the feeling of being totally consumed by him mentally and physically pushing me to the brink , threatening to tip me over the edge . “
71646	71651	71644	71644	Max	74	” I called out . “
71667	71685	71656	71656	I	0	” He was right . He did own me . I lifted my knees and he growled , “
71716	71721	71722	71722	I	0	” He thrust again . “
71762	71808	71809	71809	Max	74	” His words drifted over me like sunshine , heating my skin , ridding my brain of shadows . I wanted him so badly it was almost terrifying . Before fear could take hold , pleasure pushed out from my belly and down my limbs . “
71811	71822	71809	71809	Max	74	” I whispered , my fingernails digging into his skin . “
71832	71854	71829	71829	I	0	” He knew me , understood everything . In that moment we were joined ; we were connected ; we were inseparable .
71858	71862	71863	71863	I	0	“ Good morning , ”
71884	71888	71889	71889	she	86	“ You okay ? ”
71910	71919	71901	71901	I	0	“ I ’m excellent , how are you ? ”
72018	72052	72010	72010	I	0	“ I ’m okay , thanks . A little concerned the body snatchers have taken over my boss , but hey , we ’re in Manhattan , so it ’s to be expected . ”
72053	72065	72066	72066	I	0	“ You ’re too young to be so cynical , Donna , ”
72069	72100	72101	72101	she	86	“ Okay , now you ’re really starting to freak me out . Can I get you a coffee ? Maybe that will kick you back into a normal gear , ”
72108	72113	72114	72114	she	86	“ Be right back , ”
72287	72294	72295	72295	Puzzled	172	“ Charles Jayne on line one . ”
72338	72347	72327	72327	he	1528	“ Max King . How can I help ? ”
72348	72361	72381	72381	him	1528	“ I want to talk to you about the presentation next week . ”
72387	72415	72381	72381	him	1528	“ Yes , sir , we ’re looking forward to it . Harper ’s been doing some excellent work . I ’m sure you ’ll be impressed . ”
72416	72431	72432	72432	I	0	“ It ’s Harper ’s involvement that I want to talk to you about . ”
72438	72443	72444	72444	I	0	“ I ’m listening , ”
72456	72470	72471	72471	Charles	144	“ I like to keep my work life and my personal life separate , ”
72527	72530	72531	72531	I	0	“ Okay , ”
72534	72557	72531	72531	I	0	“ I do n’t think it ’s a good idea for Harper to work on the JD Stanley account . You understand ? ”
72567	72575	72576	72576	I	0	“ I ’m not sure I do , ”
72579	72607	72576	72576	I	0	“ I do n’t want anyone to think that a decision I make on King & Associates has anything to do with Harper . Business is business . ”
72608	72620	72531	72531	I	0	“ But I want to give you our best people and — ”
72621	72629	72630	72630	he	1530	“ It ’s entirely up to you , ”
72633	72662	72630	72630	he	1530	“ I ’m not forcing you to do anything . But if you ’re going to pitch next week , I do n’t want Harper on the team . ”
72706	72726	72693	72693	he	74	“ Of course , sir , it ’s entirely up to you what team you want to work with . ”
72727	72745	72746	72746	I	0	“ I ’m pleased you understand . I ’m looking forward to what you have to say . ”
72825	72836	72837	72837	I	0	“ I ’m going to Joey ’s for a coffee , ”
72847	72851	72852	72852	she	86	“ Everything okay ? ”
72964	72970	72971	72971	I	0	“ Can you get Harper ? ”
72985	72989	72990	72990	I	0	“ Sure thing . ”
73110	73113	73114	73114	Harper	74	“ Hi , ”
73123	73126	73117	73117	she	1532	“ Hi , ”
73135	73144	73117	73117	she	1532	“ Close the door and take a seat . ”
73159	73172	73153	73153	I	0	“ I want to talk to you about the JD Stanley account . ”
73183	73205	73173	73173	Her	1532	“ I ’m going to make a change and get Marvin to be my second chair on the JD Stanley pitch . ”
73227	73238	73239	73239	she	1532	“ Is this because I choked at the Goldman meeting ? ”
73288	73307	73280	73280	I	0	“ How am I supposed to learn from my mistakes if you do n’t give me another shot ? ”
73314	73331	73308	73308	She	1532	“ I ’m ready this time . I really know the material — even your sections . ”
73428	73440	73423	73426	the man I was	1541	“ I know you ’re ready . It ’s not that . ”
73441	73478	73491	73491	She	1542	“ I mean it , Max . I can show you . Seriously . I can give the presentation to the whole company , bring people in off the street even . I can do this . ”
73515	73528	73512	73512	I	0	“ I know there is n’t a better person for the job . ”
73529	73533	73534	73534	she	1542	“ Then why ? ”
73547	73555	73534	73534	she	1542	“ Your father called me this morning . ”
73569	73581	73563	73563	I	0	“ He said he did n’t want you at the presentation . ”
73653	73659	73660	73660	she	1542	“ Did he say why ? ”
73663	73681	73682	73682	She	1542	“ Just that he did n’t want to mix personal and professional . Which I can understand . ”
73688	73704	73682	73682	She	1542	“ He employs his three male children . That ’s not mixing business and personal ? ”
73720	73727	73715	73715	I	0	“ I understand this is frustrating . ”
73728	73731	73732	73732	she	1542	“ Frustrating ? ”
73735	73755	73732	73732	she	1542	“ Are you kidding me ? The guy ’s an asshole . He ’s trying to ruin my career . ”
73770	73785	73786	73786	I	0	“ Maybe he felt a little uncomfortable because the two of you are estranged . ”
73794	73808	73788	73788	I	0	“ I ’m sure he was n’t trying to make you look bad . ”
73822	73892	73811	73811	her	1542	“ And so what , you just said , ‘ yes , sir , thank you , sir ? Who cares if I fuck over the girl I ’ve been screwing the last few weeks . Who gives a shit about her feelings ? As long as I ’m still in line for your business , I ’ll do anything you say . ’ Is that how it went ? ”
73929	73947	73924	73924	she	1542	“ No , I said that I thought that you were the best person for the job . ”
73975	73987	73970	73970	She	1542	“ But you still told him you ’d swap me out ? ”
73988	74006	74007	74007	She	1542	“ Harper , he ’s the client . He can choose who he wants working for him . ”
74017	74072	74007	74007	She	1542	“ Guess what , asshole ? You can choose who you work for , too . Do n’t you see ? He was testing you . Seeing if he asked you to jump , if you ’d ask how high . He ’s a piece of shit who ’s determined to make me miserable . ”
74139	74150	74151	74151	she	1542	“ He asked you to choose between him and me , ”
74158	74169	74151	74151	she	1542	“ And you made your decision . So good luck . ”
74295	74302	74303	74303	Grace	90	“ Do you think he knew ? ”
74346	74356	74357	74357	I	0	“ What ? That my father was testing him ? ”
74444	74460	74461	74461	I	0	“ No , do you think your father knew Max King was fucking his daughter ? ”
74466	74479	74480	74480	She	1556	“ How could he ? And anyway , why would he care ? ”
74483	74496	74497	74497	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Fathers are protective over their daughters . ”
74500	74509	74497	74497	I	0	“ Yeah well , sperm donors are n’t . ”
74526	74552	74565	74565	He	144	“ I just think it ’s a little strange that he accepted the lunch invitation and then did n’t want you working on the account . ”
74592	74603	74604	74604	I	0	“ He just does n’t want me anywhere near him . ”
74623	74626	74620	74620	her	90	“ Maybe . ”
74627	74630	74631	74631	I	0	“ Maybe ? ”
74634	74647	74631	74631	I	0	“ It just feels like we ’re not seeing the whole picture . ”
74675	74682	74683	74683	She	90	“ Are you taking his side ? ”
74694	74720	74683	74683	She	90	“ No , not at all . There is no side for me except yours . I ’m just saying things do n’t add up . ”
74737	74771	74772	74772	She	90	“ Okay , so your father ’s an asshole . Let ’s just take that as read . And , for whatever reason , he did n’t want you working on his account . ”
74791	74826	74779	74779	she	90	“ I ’m worried about how bothered you are by it . And that you resigned from a job you worked so hard for . Are n’t you just letting your father control you ? ”
74853	74889	74890	74890	I	0	“ I just thought I had the upper hand this time . I was going to get my chance to press his nose up against the glass and show him what he ’d been missing . ”
74910	74957	74958	74958	Grace	90	“ I ’m guessing he knew that and did n’t want to see . Most assholes do n’t want to be reminded of their assholishness . They either reinvent reality so they ’re not assholes , or they avoid any situation where they could be reminded . ”
75016	75033	74998	74998	he	239	“ Your father ’s a powerful man and powerful men do n’t like to be wrong . ”
75034	75044	75045	75045	I	0	“ But he was okay to go to lunch . ”
75085	75100	75082	75082	Grace	90	“ He was probably curious , wanted to see if you ’d forgiven him . ”
75117	75134	75135	75135	Grace	90	“ And he probably did n’t give any thought to how you ’d feel about it , ”
75138	75158	75135	75135	Grace	90	“ I ’m sure he ’s like most men — too focused on themselves to worry about anyone else . ”
75261	75275	75276	75276	she	90	“ I ’d be surprised if he was trying to sabotage your career , ”
75286	75322	75276	75276	she	90	“ I ’m sure he could have stopped you from getting a job on Wall Street very easily if that ’s what he ’d wanted to do . Did he tell Max to fire you ? ”
75328	75357	75276	75276	she	90	“ I do n’t think so . Just said he did n’t want me working on the account because he wanted to keep the personal and professional separate . ”
75555	75562	75563	75563	I	0	“ It ’s such a betrayal , ”
75590	75629	75587	75587	She	90	“ I ’m sorry . I ca n’t have you spill red wine over this beautiful couch . Let it out , have a good cry , but do n’t hold red wine while you ’re doing it . ”
75645	75685	75686	75686	She	90	“ You ’re right . This couch is too good to spoil for a man . You pretend you do n’t like the finer things in life , my friend , but you ca n’t help generations of breeding . ”
75700	75724	75725	75725	I	0	“ I know . However hard I try , I ca n’t help reverting back to type . I have such good taste . ”
75728	75749	75725	75725	I	0	“ You do . However much you fight it , you ’re always going to be a Park Avenue princess . ”
75750	75769	75770	75770	Grace	90	“ There , you see ? At least I can make you laugh with my ridiculous life choices . ”
75789	75802	75770	75770	Grace	90	“ Speaking of ridiculous choices , tell me about the resigning thing . ”
75803	75830	75831	75831	I	0	“ Max had a decision to make . He knew how I felt about my father and he did n’t hesitate to pick him over me . ”
75836	75888	75831	75831	I	0	“ If he ’d just been my boss , if I had n’t told him how my father had abandoned me , I might have been able to swallow getting kicked off the JD Stanley account . But the way he so easily chose business over me was just too much . ”
75914	75927	75928	75928	she	1577	“ I did n’t realize it was that serious between you two , ”
75931	75937	75928	75928	she	1577	“ It ’s not serious . ”
75949	75964	75965	75965	Grace	90	“ But serious enough that you want him to pick you over his job , ”
75981	75990	75991	75991	Grace	90	“ What did he give as an excuse ? ”
75994	76006	75991	75991	Grace	90	“ He just said that the client can pick the team . ”
76010	76020	76007	76007	Grace	90	“ Do n’t you dare say he ’s right . ”
76029	76055	76027	76027	he	1578	“ It would be different if Max and I were n’t fucking , but we are . Were . I ’m not just his employee . ”
76091	76142	76143	76143	I	0	“ I ’m not sure you ’d be quite this upset — so upset you handed in your notice — if it were just ‘ fucking ’ . You say it ’s not serious but it sounds like it is from your perspective . Do you have feelings for him ? ”
76168	76185	76186	76186	I	0	“ I feel like I want to punch him in the face ; does that count ? ”
76353	76369	76370	76370	Grace	90	“ I think maybe you feel more for him than you ’re admitting to yourself , ”
76690	76695	76696	76696	I	0	“ This is Gucci , ”
76709	76725	76696	76696	I	0	“ Jesus , your voice carries three blocks . I think I prefer you mute . ”
76834	76848	76875	76875	I	0	“ Yeah , that skirt looks great with the YSL gray silk cami . ”
76849	76874	76875	76875	I	0	“ I ca n’t wear Gucci anything when I ’m just packing up a few things and dragging a suitcase around on the subway . ”
76954	76961	76939	76939	Grace	90	“ You love me , right ? ”
77002	77018	77019	77019	I	0	“ I do n’t know , it depends what you ’re going to say next , ”
77022	77044	77019	77019	I	0	“ Well , I was thinking that while you ’re in Manhattan , maybe you ’d want to call your father . ”
77055	77065	77045	77045	I	0	“ And why would I want to do that ? ”
77066	77079	77050	77050	her	90	“ To get some answers . Hear what he has to say . ”
77080	77093	77045	77045	I	0	“ Why would I give him any of my time or energy ? ”
77117	77120	77121	77121	she	90	“ Honestly ? ”
77124	77153	77121	77121	she	90	“ Because I think you spend far too much of your time and energy on him . Everything you do seems to be a reaction to your father . ”
77168	77185	77154	77154	I	0	“ How can you say that ? I have n’t taken anything from him since college . ”
77186	77231	77257	77257	She	1605	“ You think ending up at King & Associates , working for the only place in town that did n’t work for your father , had nothing to do with him ? You walked out of a job you supposedly loved because of him . ”
77232	77244	77245	77245	I	0	“ That was n’t about him , it was about Max , ”
77248	77256	77257	77257	She	1605	“ You ’ve got this all wrong . ”
77277	77329	77330	77330	She	1605	“ It was about a business decision Max made regarding JD Stanley — your father ’s business . Despite your desire to avoid him , he ’s everywhere in your life , pushing you down one path or another , whether it ’s to avoid him or show him his mistakes . ”
77340	77348	77337	77337	her	1605	“ Are n’t you exhausted with it ? ”
77369	77383	77359	77359	I	0	“ You think I have some kind of warped obsession with my dad ? ”
77391	77422	77423	77423	Grace	90	“ Look , you ’re not Kathy Bates Misery obsessed , but yes , I think you let him consume too much of your life , your energy . . . ”
77426	77430	77423	77423	Grace	90	“ Your happiness . ”
77467	77490	77460	77460	she	90	“ But he abandoned me and my mother . Fucked every woman in the tristate area . And all his sons work — ”
77491	77530	77460	77460	she	90	“ Look , I ’m not saying you ’re wrong . I ’m saying get some kind of closure so you can let it go . Do n’t let it rule your life . You ’re an adult . ”
77531	77540	77541	77541	He	1606	“ Just like that , let it go ? ”
77567	77616	77617	77617	I	0	“ Well , clearly it ’s not that easy — we’re not in a Disney musical — but maybe have a conversation with him . Tell him how you feel . I do n’t see how you ’ve got anything to lose . This is ruining your life . ”
77620	77631	77617	77617	I	0	“ That ’s a little dramatic , is n’t it ? ”
77635	77656	77657	77657	She	1609	“ Maybe I ’ve got it wrong , but you ’re talking to me from the floor of my closet . ”
77665	77684	77659	77659	her	1609	“ You ’re convinced your father is trying to ruin you . Well , you ’re letting him . ”
77762	77803	77804	77804	He	239	“ I ’m not saying your father is n’t an asshole . He ’s not going to win father of the year anytime soon . And I understand that when you were little he let you down again and again . ”
77810	77850	77851	77851	She	1613	“ And I ’m not saying you have to have some kind of idyllic relationship . Just accept the reality of the situation and get on with your own life . I think a conversation with him might help . ”
78035	78047	78048	78048	Grace	90	“ You have to deal with the root of the issue , ”
78051	78082	78048	78048	Grace	90	“ My grandma always said , ‘ If you just chop the heads off of weeds , they come back . ’ So far , she ’s never been wrong . ”
78143	78151	78131	78131	I	0	“ Which one is the YSL vest ? ”
78288	78291	78281	78282	Immediately footsteps	175	“ Hello ? ”
78300	78310	78281	78282	Immediately footsteps	175	“ Hi , Miriam , is my father home ? ”
78311	78327	78328	78328	She	1635	“ Harper ? Good God , child , I ’ve not seen you in years . ”
78335	78378	78328	78328	She	1635	“ You ’re looking too thin . Can I get you something to eat ? The soup I ’m making wo n’t be ready for a few hours , but I roasted a chicken yesterday . I could make you a sandwich . ”
78379	78388	78389	78389	I	0	“ Thank you , but I ’m fine . ”
78408	78419	78443	78443	her	1635	“ It ’s nice to see you looking so well . ”
78420	78438	78439	78439	She	1635	“ Old , dear , that ’s how I look , but that ’s what I am . ”
78454	78463	78439	78439	She	1635	“ Let me call upstairs to his study . ”
78493	78513	78514	78514	I	0	“ You can go up , lovely . It ’s the second floor , first door on your right . ”
78546	78555	78556	78556	He	239	“ Harper . How lovely to see you . ”
78596	78602	78603	78603	I	0	“ Thanks for seeing me , ”
78617	78625	78634	78634	he	239	“ Of course . I ’m delighted . ”
78646	78657	78634	78634	he	239	“ Did Miriam offer you something to eat or drink ? ”
78663	78676	78634	78634	he	239	“ An entire roast dinner if I ’d wanted , I think . ”
78677	78685	78686	78686	We	1644	“ Good , good . Come in . ”
78738	78767	78731	78731	He	239	“ Sorry , we should n’t be across a desk like this . We can go downstairs . Or out in the garden . I did n’t think . ”
78797	78802	78803	78803	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
78810	78815	78803	78803	I	0	“ Here ’s good . ”
78821	78851	78816	78816	He	239	“ If you ’re sure . Miriam sent you up here because I ’m not as good with the stairs since I injured my knee playing tennis last summer . ”
78871	78876	78877	78877	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
78880	78904	78877	78877	I	0	“ Yes , yes , but I ’m getting older and my body does n’t bounce back in the way it used to . ”
78912	78923	78924	78924	He	239	“ Anyway , it ’s very nice to see you . ”
78935	78964	78928	78928	he	239	“ We did n’t really get to speak as much as I ’d hoped at lunch . How are you ? Are you enjoying being in New York ? ”
79016	79021	78994	78995	My father	239	“ Everything ’s good . ”
79030	79041	79022	79022	I	0	“ I imagine you ’re wondering why I ’m here — ”
79042	79085	79022	79022	I	0	“ I do n’t blame you for King & Associates canceling our meeting , if that ’s what you think . I should never have asked for you to be replaced . I just thought it would be easier if . . . ”
79086	79089	79022	79022	I	0	“ What ? ”
79097	79110	79022	79022	I	0	“ But all ’s well that ends well . You ’re here . ”
79156	79172	79147	79147	I	0	“ I ’m not following you . King & Associates canceled their meeting with you ? ”
79173	79188	79191	79191	Max	74	“ Yes , which is fine . We have excellent in - house resources . ”
79208	79211	79212	79212	His	239	“ Yesterday . ”
79217	79223	79212	79212	His	239	“ You did n’t know ? ”
79270	79278	79268	79268	Max	74	“ Can I ask you a question ? ”
79288	79301	79279	79280	My father	239	“ Why did n’t you offer me a job at JD Stanley ? ”
79368	79382	79364	79364	he	239	“ Look , I know I have n’t been a very good father . ”
79443	79502	79425	79425	I’d	0	“ I never got it right with my kids when they were young . I did n’t have much of a relationship with any of your mothers , and I always felt like a fraud whenever I spent time with any of you . It was easier to throw money at a situation and go about my day . ”
79503	79507	79508	79508	I	0	“ A fraud ? ”
79534	79554	79529	79529	He	1655	“ No one could ever describe me as a family man , and your mother was a good person . ”
79555	79559	79529	79529	He	1655	“ I know . ”
79570	79578	79564	79564	him	1655	“ She did the best she could . ”
79579	79611	79529	79529	He	1655	“ Which was pretty damn good given the way you turned out . You ’re a beautiful , bright , accomplished woman . And I can take none of the credit . ”
79671	79707	79661	79661	he	1655	“ It ’s a shitty excuse , but I guess I did n’t feel I could do anything but make the situation worse . The best way I knew how to contribute was through money . ”
79741	79758	79727	79727	He	1655	“ And I was young and I was working twenty hours a day and . . . ”
79764	79790	79727	79727	He	1655	“ You know . I liked the women . So I guess I felt like a hypocrite then , trying to play the family man . ”
79791	79807	79808	79808	My	0	“ I guess the first time you got a girl pregnant that would make sense . ”
79830	79877	79827	79827	He	1655	“ You ’re right . I have n’t just made mistakes in my life , I ’ve repeated them . But I have to answer to my other children about their situation . I ’m describing my reasons for acting the way I did with you . ”
79878	79886	79887	79887	He	1655	“ You have n’t answered my question . ”
79890	79921	79887	79887	He	1655	“ Why would I offer you a job when you so clearly held me in contempt ? It was different with your brothers — they allowed me to make amends . ”
79925	79934	79935	79935	Typical	177	“ Right . So this is my fault . ”
79952	79969	79937	79937	I	0	“ I ’m not blaming you , but somehow I built a relationship with your brothers . ”
79984	80007	79981	79982	a father	347	“ I ’d hoped we would do the same , but while you were at college , you cut off all contact . ”
80008	80022	80023	80023	I	0	“ And you threw money at the situation by setting up the trust ? ”
80026	80057	80023	80023	I	0	“ I guess . I thought that at least if you were okay financially for the rest of your life then I did n’t have that guilt to live with . ”
80058	80071	79981	79982	a father	347	“ So it was n’t because I ’m a girl ? Woman . ”
80072	80075	80076	80076	He	347	“ What ? ”
80087	80156	80076	80076	He	347	“ Of course not . You made it clear you did n’t want a relationship , and if I ’m going to be completely honest , I did n’t want a constant reminder of how I ’d failed with you . It ’s hard knowing your kid hates you , sees you as some kind of monster . Even harder to know it ’s in some ways justified . ”
80183	80197	80198	80198	He	347	“ Is that why you told Max to drop me from the team ? ”
80204	80231	80232	80232	He	347	“ Partly . But also because I could n’t engage a company for a large amount of money when my daughter was involved in the account . ”
80244	80276	80277	80277	He	347	“ I know I employ my sons , but I do n’t manage them , and their salaries are considerably less than what I would have spent with King & Associates . ”
80285	80317	80279	80279	his	347	“ I should have mentioned something at lunch , or called you afterward . It was just that things were civil between us and I did n’t want to ruin that . ”
80328	80353	80318	80318	He	347	“ It ’s like I lose all sense of judgment when it comes to you . I get things wrong however hard I try . ”
80502	80521	80522	80522	he	347	“ I never wanted to hurt you , but I just did n’t know how to avoid it , ”
80567	80572	80564	80564	I	0	“ I believe you . ”
80581	80588	80573	80573	He	347	“ I ca n’t tell you — ”
80595	80628	80629	80629	He	347	“ I ’d like a chance to do better , if that ’s something you ’d be interested in ? Maybe we could spend some time together , have dinner or something . ”
80685	80694	80695	80695	He	347	“ I need a chance to digest this . ”
80719	80723	80724	80724	He	347	“ I understand . ”
80751	80765	80766	80766	My	0	“ Maybe I can stay for a drink and a sandwich next time . ”
80873	80884	80868	80868	He	347	“ I would love that . You just decide when . ”
80895	80900	80901	80901	I	0	“ Maybe next weekend , ”
80904	80912	80913	80913	he	347	“ I would like that very much , ”
80940	80951	80933	80933	I	0	“ Save your knee — I’ll see you on Saturday . ”
80957	80966	80967	80967	I	0	“ Oh , yes and one final thing , ”
81006	81014	80988	80988	she	90	“ He said Max canceled his appointment . ”
81043	81046	81047	81047	Grace	90	“ Wow . ”
81055	81065	81052	81052	her	90	“ So now you can make up with Max . ”
81073	81084	81085	81085	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? Max is history , ”
81091	81098	81085	81085	I	0	“ I need to move on . ”
81171	81188	81168	81168	Grace	90	“ I ’ve known you a long time , Harper . You ca n’t fool me . ”
81189	81198	81168	81168	Grace	90	“ I do n’t know what you mean . ”
81199	81215	81168	81168	Grace	90	“ If Max was history , you would n’t have moved out of your apartment . ”
81216	81226	81168	81168	Grace	90	“ I ’m avoiding him because it ’s over . ”
81253	81286	81287	81287	she	1675	“ No , you ’re avoiding him because you do n’t want it to be . First , you quit your job because he did n’t choose you over a business deal , ”
81295	81326	81287	81287	she	1675	“ Then you were practically catatonic for the first few days after you split and although you ’re moving around now , your neutral gear is still set to mope . ”
81334	81349	81327	81327	She	1675	“ You wo n’t turn your phone on because you ’re avoiding his messages . ”
81357	81386	81350	81350	She	1675	“ My point is , he ’s the more handsome version of the best - looking man on the planet , and you are in love with him . ”
81387	81393	81394	81394	I	0	“ In love with him ? ”
81397	81403	81394	81394	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
81424	81442	81350	81350	She	1675	“ And the fact that he pulled out of the JD Stanley pitch , well that ’s — ”
81443	81457	81350	81350	She	1675	“ That ’s what ? He should have done that to start with . ”
81458	81498	81350	81350	She	1675	“ Are you crazy ? Max was right ; the client gets to choose their team . If you two were just banging , he would have told you to suck it up . He clearly cares about you . ”
81525	81545	81546	81546	Grace	90	“ You were waiting for him to fail , to live down to who you thought your father was , ”
81593	81600	81589	81589	I	0	“ He ’s not my father . ”
81614	81630	81631	81631	Grace	90	“ So turn on your phone . Actually , no , I ’ll do it . ”
81758	81808	81750	81750	She	90	“ I guarantee you ’ll have a hundred messages and voicemails from him . Not many men can break through that invisible force field you have around your heart , my beautiful friend . Do n’t take it for granted . Make it right before it ’s too late . ”
81812	81817	81818	81818	Scarlett	128	“ You seem off , ”
81865	81873	81852	81852	Scarlett	128	“ What ’s the matter with you ? ”
81874	81882	81883	81883	I	0	“ You always think I ’m off , ”
81939	81958	81959	81959	She	128	“ True , but this is different . Tell your sister all about it . Is it work ? ”
81962	81988	81959	81959	She	128	“ Have you become addicted to gambling ? Lost all your money ? Did you find out you have a horrible disease of the penis ? ”
81992	82004	81989	81989	I	0	“ Stop it . I ’m just busy at the office . ”
82036	82050	82051	82051	I	0	“ That ’s bullshit . I know busy - at - work off . ”
82055	82077	82051	82051	I	0	“ It ’s nothing . A girl at work disappeared and I ’m just a little concerned . That ’s all . ”
82078	82088	82089	82089	I	0	“ What do you mean disappeared ? Like kidnapped ? ”
82094	82108	82089	82089	I	0	“ You always assume the most dramatic scenario possible , do n’t you ? ”
82122	82149	82109	82109	She	128	“ Well , if it ’s got you all somber and mopey with dark circles under your eyes , I ’m assuming something really bad happened . ”
82150	82158	82159	82159	I	0	“ I ’m not somber and mopey , ”
82162	82174	82159	82159	I	0	“ Harper resigned and I ca n’t get ahold of her . ”
82175	82178	82179	82179	she	128	“ Harper ? ”
82217	82222	82223	82223	Violet	134	“ What ’s up ? ”
82234	82244	82226	82226	she	134	“ Are we eating soon ? I ’m famished . ”
82245	82257	82258	82258	Scarlett	128	“ Harper resigned and Max ca n’t get hold of her , ”
82288	82295	82296	82296	I	0	“ It ’s no big deal , ”
82299	82306	82296	82296	I	0	“ Do you want a refill ? ”
82311	82322	82323	82323	Violet	134	“ Always . Where do you think she ’s gone ? ”
82355	82361	82346	82346	I	0	“ I have no idea . ”
82373	82403	82362	82362	I	0	“ I ’ve called her a million times but she ’s just not answering . I can only hope she ’s mad and not , you know , hurting . ”
82598	82604	82605	82605	Scarlett	128	“ What did you do ? ”
82608	82631	82632	82632	I	0	“ I fucked everything up . That ’s what I did . I tossed her off a big pitch and she quit . ”
82806	82820	82821	82821	Scarlett	128	“ I feel like you ’re missing an important part of the story , ”
82824	82849	82821	82821	Scarlett	128	“ I ’m not sure , but you kicking an employee off the team and her quitting would n’t normally get you this ruffled . ”
82920	82925	82926	82926	Violet	134	“ You like her ? ”
82932	82935	82936	82936	Scarlett	128	“ Finally , ”
82943	82949	82950	82950	Violet	134	“ And was it reciprocated ? ”
82972	82978	82969	82969	I	0	“ How could I tell ? ”
82999	83013	82988	82988	she	134	“ Well , does she maintain eye contact with you ? Does she — ”
83014	83057	83058	83058	Scarlett	128	“ Jesus , Violet , do you know our brother at all ? The man ’s not a monk ; he knows when women want him . He ’s asking how does he know if she has feelings . Am I right ? ”
83064	83067	83061	83061	I	0	“ Yes . ”
83092	83099	83100	83100	Violet	134	“ So you were sleeping together ? ”
83111	83117	83103	83103	Scarlett	128	“ Try to keep up . ”
83118	83121	83122	83122	Violet	134	“ What ? ”
83125	83139	83122	83122	Violet	134	“ No one told me he was sleeping with her . You knew ? ”
83140	83144	83103	83103	Scarlett	128	“ I suspected . ”
83145	83150	83151	83151	I	0	“ You did not , ”
83154	83165	83151	83151	I	0	“ You say that now , but you knew nothing . ”
83166	83185	83186	83186	Scarlett	128	“ I could tell when I met her in the elevator that there was something between you two . ”
83189	83240	83186	83186	Scarlett	128	“ I have a sixth sense for these things . Anyway , let ’s get back to the fact that our brother has feelings for someone . I mean , this has never happened before . We need to stay focused . How long has the sex been going on ? ”
83302	83313	83315	83315	she	1703	“ It was casual ; we did n’t go out . ”
83323	83355	83315	83315	she	1703	“ I should have taken her on a date or something . I was planning to talk to her about what she wanted when she came up for Amanda ’s dance . ”
83356	83368	83369	83369	Violet	134	“ What , so it was a series of booty calls ? ”
83397	83407	83408	83408	I	0	“ I ’ve never really done the dating thing , ”
83411	83430	83408	83408	I	0	“ We live in the same building and I ’m here so much of the time . . . ”
83464	83479	83480	83480	Violet	134	“ Did you do things together ? Cook ? Hang out without the sex ? ”
83486	83495	83483	83483	I	0	“ We got takeout , does that count ? ”
83510	83520	83483	83483	I	0	“ We ’d spend the evening together . Talk . ”
83561	83576	83544	83544	She	134	“ Well , that ’s good . And it was early days , right ? ”
83577	83580	83581	83581	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
83631	83647	83648	83648	Violet	134	“ And she quit because you kicked her off the team pitching to her father ? ”
83651	83678	83648	83648	Violet	134	“ Yes . Her father called and said he did n’t want her involved in the account because he wanted to keep business and personal separate . ”
83679	83696	83697	83697	Scarlett	128	“ And you thought that was fine because it ’s how you like to operate too ? ”
83700	83729	83697	83697	Scarlett	128	“ Yeah . I saw him as a potential client asking for a simple team change , rather than a father who was not putting his daughter first . ”
83730	83733	83734	83734	Violet	134	“ Honestly , ”
83737	83751	83734	83734	Violet	134	“ that does n’t sound like anything you ca n’t come back from . ”
83752	83760	83761	83761	I	0	“ I pulled out of the pitch , ”
83764	83768	83769	83769	Scarlett	128	“ You did ? ”
83772	83779	83769	83769	Scarlett	128	“ Wow . Does she know ? ”
83785	83832	83780	83780	I	0	“ No , I did it after I saw how upset she was and I realized how he just had n’t given a shit about her . If he was prepared to do that to his daughter , what would he do to a business partner ? ”
83873	83882	83866	83866	I	0	“ Now she ’s gone , just disappeared . ”
83883	83891	83892	83892	Scarlett	128	“ You must really love this girl . ”
83895	83904	83892	83892	Scarlett	128	“ I ’ve never seen you like this . ”
83905	83922	83923	83923	I	0	“ Quit the dramatics . I ’m not saying I love her , I . . . ”
83934	83958	83959	83959	Scarlett	128	“ But if she wo n’t speak to me , wo n’t answer the phone or the door , what do I do ? ”
83967	83970	83971	83971	she	128	“ Amanda ! ”
83974	83982	83983	83983	I	0	“ Do n’t say anything to her , ”
83986	83990	83991	83991	she	128	“ Just trust me ”
84028	84058	84020	84020	She	81	“ Put your phone down while you ’re walking . One day you ’re going to step out in front of a bus because you ’re fixating over Snapchat . ”
84072	84081	84061	84061	her	81	“ Is dinner ready ? I ’m hungry . ”
84082	84092	84093	84093	Scarlett	128	“ Are you looking forward to the dance tomorrow ? ”
84121	84152	84115	84115	Amanda	81	“ Yes , it ’s going to be perfect . Callum finally asked me yesterday . I told him I was going stag . I do n’t need a man . ”
84188	84196	84197	84197	Scarlett	128	“ And your dress is all set ? ”
84208	84224	84200	84200	Amanda	81	“ Yes , you saw it right ? The one Harper helped me pick out . ”
84225	84242	84243	84243	Violet	134	“ Harper ’s the girl your dad works with who you like to hang out with ? ”
84267	84289	84254	84254	Amanda	81	“ You met her , right , Scarlett ? She ’s so cool and pretty . Is n’t she , Dad ? ”
84305	84313	84301	84301	I	0	“ Yes , she ’s very pretty . ”
84314	84339	84301	84301	I	0	“ You ’ll get to meet her too , Violet . You ’re coming to help me get ready for the dance , right ? ”
84359	84371	84372	84373	My daughter	1965	“ Of course . Would n’t miss it for the world . ”
84387	84399	84400	84400	I	0	“ I need to talk to you about Harper , sweetheart , ”

84437	84476	84477	84477	Amanda	81	“ I ’m not sure if she ’s still going to make it , peanut . But you ’ll have your aunts . And we can put your mother on Skype the entire time you ’re getting ready . ”
84486	84520	84482	84482	her	81	“ What are you talking about ? Of course Harper ’s going to make it . She said this morning that she ’d be here by four . She ’s bringing her makeup . ”

84675	84697	84698	84698	I	0	“ Just because she ’s agreed to come and help Amanda does n’t mean she wants anything to do with me , ”
84711	84723	84698	84698	I	0	“ You do n’t think this is a little bit much ? ”

84786	84813	84783	84783	Scarlett	128	“ And anyway , what have you got to lose ? Worst case scenario you ’re no worse off than you were before she walked in . ”
84850	84864	84865	84865	Amanda	81	“ I polished all the silverware , just how Grandma King showed me , ”

85021	85034	85035	85035	Scarlett	128	“ Jesus , did you lose your balls somewhere along the line ? ”
85038	85101	85035	85035	Scarlett	128	“ You ask her if you can talk for a few minutes . Then you apologize and admit you ’re an idiot . See how she reacts — if you need to apologize again , do it and then tell her how you feel . Jesus , man , you run a multimillion - dollar company ; it ’s not that hard . ”
85154	85164	85165	85165	Violet	134	“ You ’re not wearing that , are you ? ”
85172	85176	85177	85177	Scarlett	128	“ Good point , ”
85180	85204	85177	85177	Scarlett	128	“ Go put on your best jeans and a blue button down . The slogan T - shirt is n’t working for you . ”

85409	85425	85406	85406	Grace	90	“ And anyway , whatever happens , you ’ve done the right thing by Amanda . ”
85480	85488	85489	85489	Grace	90	“ What did you end up wearing ? ”
85492	85506	85489	85489	Grace	90	“ Please tell me you put a skirt on . Men like skirts . ”

85702	85717	85720	85720	she	1745	“ Okay , well , you wo n’t need it , but good luck . ”

86352	86363	86364	86364	Amanda	81	“ Come on upstairs . We do n’t have long , ”
86367	86385	86386	86386	Max	74	“ You have two hours , which is plenty long enough to introduce Harper to your aunts , ”

86719	86724	86716	86716	he	74	“ What ’s that ? ”

88726	88780	88715	88715	He	74	“ Maybe I gave you the impression that it was just sex , but I ’m not sure it was ever that for me . I want to take you out on dates , to have you here with me and Amanda . I want to talk and laugh and wake up together . ”
88788	88822	88785	88785	his	74	“ I thought we had time . I missed the bit where I told you how important you were to me . I told you I ’ve had zero practice at this stuff . ”

88952	88956	88957	88957	He	74	“ You do ? ”
88960	88994	88957	88957	He	74	“ And I ’m ready to make any promises you want . I want to be the man who deserves you . The man who will do anything for the woman he loves . ”

I ’ve dreamt about bending you over on the kitchen counter and fucking you from behind , thought about laying you out on the dining table and making your pussy quiver with my tongue . But right now I ’m going to make love to you in my bed . ”
89678	89686	89687	89687	he	74	“ These have been driving me crazy , ”
