10685	10728	10667	10667	She	84	“ You should n’t decide for the world , Sara . The world is fickle and does n’t even know what it wants . Is n’t it better to let others reject you than you yourself rejecting possibilities before even exploring them ? ”

10800	10830	10831	10831	I	0	“ Wow . You ’re a good roomie . I did n’t know I ’d have a therapist available twenty - four / seven when I took you in , ”

11848	11897	11843	11843	I	0	“ Not really . More like did n’t do . We do n’t feel you ’re as passionate as some of your coworkers . We ’re also making cuts , and when it came down to it , I believe you ’re the weakest member of the team . ”

Two years went by , and recovery was a bitch , but even once healed , nothing . No leads , no successful auditions . So I became a concierge , and even then , doing something supposedly easy , I fail . ”

13505	13528	13502	13502	she	84	“ but I could never understand how he made me feel . I guess I liked him enough that it confused me . ”
13545	13577	13539	13539	she	84	“ But enough about that . I ’m excited about the start - up . If this takes off and you do n’t have a job , I ’ll hire you . ”

16290	16315	16203	16203	Bryn	98	“ Your designs walking around Manhattan — hell , the whole country . Getting worn and adored . How does it make you feel ? ”
16316	16338	16203	16203	Bryn	98	“ Amazing does n’t cover it . But why is it that no matter the success , we always want more ? ”

16402	16451	16399	16399	I	0	“ Well , it ’s the dream . Finding the one who makes your heart go pitter - pat . Makes me sad I found one who really lit me up . Makes everything seem drabber once they ’re gone and you have no way of finding them . ”

16472	16503	16504	16504	She	98	“ Sara was wonderful . Our Boston Terrier adores her . She ’s even taught him to walk on a leash without pulling . So glad to have discovered her ! ”

16909	16925	16931	16931	she	84	“ Taurus . Ruled by Venus , I apparently like very beautiful and expensive things . ”
16937	16943	16931	16931	she	84	“ What does it say ? ”
16944	16963	16964	16964	She	84	“ Do n’t peek and do n’t talk — I ca n’t concentrate on reading with noise around ! ”

17118	17157	17110	17110	She	84	“ No , really . You ’re hooked on him , Sara . I do think you need to find him . Why wait ? You can be waiting forever . Why do we give our power away ? ”
17162	17229	17158	17158	She	84	“ I mean , we ’re bombarded by all these marketers telling us what to think , how to feel about ourselves ; we wait to see what others think about our clothes to determine if we really like them . We wait for an astrologer to tell us the coast is clear to do something we ’ve been wanting to do . It ’s wrong . ”
17244	17268	17269	17269	she	84	“ Let ’s do something we really want to do . Let ’s finally do something for ourselves , take our own advice , ”
17272	17276	17269	17269	she	84	“ Okay then . ”
17405	17410	17397	17397	he	76	“ Oui . François . ”

18577	18638	18529	18529	I	0	“ Actually , that ’s why I ’m calling . I ’m stuck in Central Park , and I desperately need you to change places with me . Since you ’ve filled in for me with Mrs. Ford before , would you mind helping out again ? I need to rush home to change for a date with Christos tonight . ”

29037	29055	29031	29031	I	0	“ Nah . I just … I ’ve been a bit in a cloud since last night . ”
29065	29073	29056	29056	I	0	“ What ? You ’re not happy ? ”
29074	29093	29094	29094	I	0	“ Yes , with the job ; it ’s just that today I ’m a bit … spacey . ”
29126	29134	29135	29135	he	109	“ Okay . Spill it , woman , ”
29138	29178	29135	29135	he	109	“ I found out my one - night stand ’s name . More than that , I found out he ’s the grandson of one of my and Bryn ’s customers . We spent the night at a hotel . ”
29179	29189	29190	29190	He	109	“ Sheshus , that ’s fucking killer , Sara . ”
29204	29218	29190	29190	He	109	“ No , it ’s not ! He ’s fucking married , Jensen . ”
29219	29223	29224	29224	Jensen	109	“ Say what ? ”
29238	29243	29244	29244	He	109	“ Fuck . Okay . ”
29252	29283	29244	29244	He	109	“ No matter . It ’s never a mistake when you get the O , you know what I mean ? And you did get the O. Did n’t you ? ”
29287	29337	29284	29284	I	0	“ God ! Multiple times . That guy is so good he could make me O just from kissing . But he ’s married . In the process of getting divorced , but that ’s what they all say , right ? I ’m not that girl , Jensen ! ”
29362	29425	29350	29350	I	0	“ Forget him . Tell him ‘ thanks for the O , but that ’s all you ’re good at . ’ And move on . Get out more . Can I introduce you to some friends ? I know a few people who can take care of the sex issue , no strings . A fuck - buddy type of thing . ”
29426	29433	29434	29434	I	0	“ In their dreams , Jensen ! ”
29439	29444	29445	29445	he	785	“ The wet ones , ”
29453	29458	29459	29459	He	785	“ You ’re disgusting . ”
29466	29477	29459	29459	He	785	“ What happened with his marriage ? Do you know ? ”
29478	29489	29490	29490	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I did n’t ask . ”
29497	29509	29490	29490	I	0	“ There ’s such chemistry between us . It ’s unreal . ”
29513	29550	29490	29490	I	0	“ But then he told me his situation , and I said it was over and walked out . I ’m jealous , you know ? Just thinking that some other woman has rights to him . ”
29573	29628	29629	29629	I	0	“ I do n’t want anyone else to have him , but I am definitely not looking forward to something this complex and … complicated . I ’m scared he ’s working me out of his system in men ’s usual ways — maybe even using me to get over the ex or whatever . ”
29633	29642	29629	29629	I	0	“ Is it a mutual decision to divorce ? ”
29643	29667	29554	29554	he	785	“ I have no idea . I should ’ve asked . Instead , I panicked , saw the red flags , and left . ”
29668	29691	29629	29629	I	0	“ Then take it as closure and move on . If not me , have Bryn set you up on a date . ”
29692	29718	29719	29719	I	0	“ I do n’t know , Jen — things with Christos are over , and I ’m not sure she can move on that easily , ”
29722	29745	29719	29719	I	0	“ This time I had a second - night stand . Give me one reason why it would n’t feel like closure ? ”
29752	29755	29746	29746	I	0	“ Easy . ”
29772	29780	29756	29756	Jensen	109	“ You want more of the big D. ”
29781	29803	29804	29804	I	0	“ Oh ! He has a very nice D and I would n’t mind more of it . But it just … ”
29818	29844	29814	29816	Fucking Ian Ford	119	“ I want him to want me ; that ’s not typically me . I ’m usually dreading that they ’ll call again , Jen . ”
29845	29853	29756	29756	Jensen	109	“ Damn , that ’s a problem . ”
29854	29858	29859	29859	I	0	“ I know . ”
29867	29907	29859	29859	I	0	“ Okay . I need to head to the office . Bryn must be waiting , and there ’s something going down with Christos that I ’m worried about . I ’ll let you know when I know more . ”
29908	29929	29756	29756	Jensen	109	“ Please do . I ’m a hairsbreadth away from hunting Christos down and beating him up for hurting her . ”
29930	29942	29943	29943	I	0	“ I know you are . I know you love Bryn . ”
29957	29965	29966	29966	he	787	“ Sara . What about the auditions ? ”
29969	29994	29966	29966	he	787	“ Still waiting for the call . Hoping something else will come up . The more auditions , the better the possibilities , right ? ”
29995	30005	30006	30006	he	787	“ Damn right . Break a leg , princess , ”
30009	30015	30006	30006	he	787	“ I already did once ! ”
30075	30096	30073	30073	Robert	83	“ Sara , you wo n’t believe who ’s at the hotel right now . He just ordered room service . ”
30126	30134	30115	30115	Ian	119	“ Until when is his room booked ? ”
30135	30154	30115	30115	Ian	119	“ Only until tomorrow , unfortunately . But he ’s back in 1103 . His name is Ian — ”
30155	30166	30167	30167	I	0	“ Ford . I know . I just found out . ”
30170	30175	30167	30167	I	0	“ Thanks , Robert . ”
30235	30244	30245	30245	I	0	“ Mr. Ford ? Did you hear me ? ”
30267	30272	30264	30264	I	0	“ I heard you . ”
30513	30516	30502	30502	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
30517	30564	30502	30502	I	0	“ I ’ve got good news . We ’ve had the talk with your accountant like you requested . Threatened to remove your business if he did n’t come forward with the truth . And he ’s willing to testify to his affair with your wife . ”
30565	30573	30574	30574	I	0	“ Good . Finally there ’s something . ”
30598	30637	30591	30591	I	0	“ Call Cordelia . Let her know the minute details of the situation and tell her my offer for the house and half my money still stands . I just want to get this over with at last . ”
30638	30644	30645	30645	I	0	“ I ’ll update you . ”
30765	30771	30772	30772	I	0	“ How ’s my girl ? ”
30778	30783	30784	30784	She	526	“ Oh , Ian . ”
30787	30797	30784	30784	She	526	“ Am I seeing you for dinner as planned ? ”
30798	30803	30762	30763	my grandmother	526	“ That ’s right . ”
30804	30813	30762	30763	my grandmother	526	“ I ’m making meatballs , your favorite . ”
30814	30846	30784	30784	She	526	“ I ’m salivating already . Listen , Gran . How about you call the dog walker , Sara , so she and I can take Milly out for you tonight ? ”
30847	30870	30762	30763	my grandmother	526	“ She was coming this afternoon for Milly ’s walk . I was planning to cook your meatballs while they were out . ”
30871	30888	30762	30763	my grandmother	526	“ Good . Something ’s come up at the office and I ’ll be free early . ”
30889	30893	30894	30894	she	800	“ Ian Ford ! ”
30912	30915	30905	30905	I	0	“ What ? ”
30916	30945	30946	30946	I	0	“ Do n’t think I do n’t know what you ’re doing . I want you to know that I fully , wholeheartedly , very thoroughly … approve . ”
31248	31269	31236	31237	Mrs. Ford	102	“ My grandson has n’t been in town for a while . He ’s going through a very ugly divorce . ”
31270	31273	31299	31299	her	102	“ Oh . ”
31274	31296	31297	31297	She	102	“ It ’s been going on for a while , but that little tramp he married just ca n’t let go . ”
31302	31321	31299	31299	her	102	“ That ’s what he gets for marrying a woman more interested in his money than his happiness . ”
31322	31328	31299	31299	her	102	“ What does he do ? ”
31329	31363	31299	31299	her	102	“ He ’s a film producer . Mostly documentaries . He travels for work a lot . I admit he does n’t like being in the city anymore , and with good reason ! ”
31364	31368	31369	31369	I	0	“ Mrs. Ford , ”
31390	31395	31372	31372	she	102	“ Yes , dear ? ”
31396	31448	31299	31299	her	102	“ I do n’t know that I can continue walking Milly . Bryn is about to open her business , and as her PA , I ’m going to be much busier . I also do some catalogue modeling on the side , and it ’s time - consuming as well . ”
31449	31456	31372	31372	she	102	“ You ’re modeling , Sara ? ”
31457	31460	31461	31461	I	0	“ Yes , ”
31475	31488	31469	31469	she	102	“ but I told her to cut my face off the images . ”
31489	31494	31495	31495	She	102	“ Why on earth ? ”
31499	31531	31495	31495	She	102	“ I do n’t know . But I would rather be doing something that stimulates my mind a little more . Posing is boring and it makes me self - conscious . ”
31532	31572	31573	31573	I	0	“ You have nothing to be self - conscious about ; you ’re gorgeous , Sara — model gorgeous , with that ballerina body and those beautiful eyes . Tell me the real reason you ca n’t walk Milly . ”
31601	31617	31618	31618	I	0	“ I just do n’t know that I can keep coming , that ’s all . ”
31651	31658	31645	31645	I	0	“ Is it about my grandson ? ”
31659	31663	31700	31700	she	102	“ Excuse me ? ”
31664	31674	31645	31645	I	0	“ He asked me when you were coming over . ”
31675	31678	31645	31645	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
31693	31699	31700	31700	she	102	“ That must be him , ”
31729	31734	31735	31736	Mrs. Ford	102	“ Ian , darling ! ”
31759	31768	31745	31745	Ian	119	“ Gran . How ’s my girl today ? ”
31967	31973	31974	31974	I	0	“ I should get going , ”
31985	31997	32000	32000	her	102	“ If you ’ll excuse me . Come here , Milly . ”
32033	32039	32021	32021	Ian	119	“ I ’ve got it . ”
32083	32090	32091	32091	he	119	“ I came here for you , ”
32094	32101	32091	32091	he	119	“ I do n’t see why . ”
32102	32110	32111	32112	Mrs. Ford	102	“ I ’m going to finish dinner ! ”
32118	32133	32111	32112	Mrs. Ford	102	“ Ian , do n’t come on too strong ; she ’s not Cordelia . ”
32134	32146	32147	32147	he	119	“ Thanks , Gran . I think I ’ve got this , ”
32163	32177	32178	32178	I	0	“ I do n’t think this is the time or the appropriate place , ”
32278	32287	32288	32288	I	0	“ Can I at least have the leash ? ”
32401	32408	32409	32409	We	829	“ You came here from work ? ”
32422	32429	32430	32430	I	0	“ I did . And you ? ”
32516	32531	32532	32532	I	0	“ Why do n’t you stay with your grandmother when you ’re in town ? ”
32564	32583	32584	32584	He	837	“ She has her own life . I ’ve got mine . I do n’t want to intrude . ”
32587	32603	32584	32584	He	837	“ Besides , I have a home here . I just do n’t use it . ”
32616	32625	32584	32584	He	837	“ Do you come to the city often ? ”
32643	32667	32668	32668	His	837	“ Once a month . Though I had a project to film in LA for the past few months that kept me away . ”
32715	32719	32720	32720	I	0	“ Your parents ? ”
32723	32731	32720	32720	I	0	“ Both passed away . Boating accident . ”
32745	32750	32751	32751	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
32814	32825	32826	32826	I	0	“ Death has always had a way of frightening me , ”
32831	32841	32826	32826	I	0	“ Just you or everybody else , you think ? ”
32850	32883	32826	32826	I	0	“ Ha . I suppose everyone . But it scares me to think that nothing is permanent … that nothing really lasts . Even the most precious thing we have . Life . ”
32929	32940	32941	32941	I	0	“ Makes it feel so fragile . Everything so elusive , ”
32944	32980	32941	32941	I	0	“ My roommate ’s parents died when she was young too . She recommended some books that she read , about reincarnation ? I got hooked on the topic . That made me worry less . ”
32981	32985	33030	33030	his	119	“ About what ? ”
32986	33003	33004	33004	He	119	“ I do n’t know . About dying , I suppose . That it ’s not forever ”
33009	33018	33004	33004	He	119	“ Do n’t they say nothing is forever ? ”
33019	33026	33030	33030	his	119	“ The good things should be ! ”
33084	33089	33090	33090	I	0	“ What about you , ”
33093	33098	33090	33090	I	0	“ What about me ? ”
33099	33106	33075	33075	I	0	“ Tell me what you do . ”

33157	33192	33154	33154	his	119	“ Hell , I tell Gran that I ’m not marrying again . Instead , I ’m getting a dog or a big , fat cat and leaving my fortune to him and Milly . ”
33193	33199	33200	33200	I	0	“ Oh , come on ! ”
33209	33218	33200	33200	I	0	“ I ’m sure you ’ll find someone . ”

33284	33295	33296	33296	I	0	“ But you can choose the way you ’re living , ”
33303	33315	33316	33316	He	119	“ I ’d have loved for you to meet my parents . ”

33378	33386	33387	33387	he	119	“ My mother would have liked you , ”
33390	33413	33387	33387	he	119	“ I would have no doubt liked her like I do Mrs. Ford . Were they similar ? She and Mrs. Ford ? ”
33414	33432	33449	33449	he	119	“ They were alike . Like mother , like daughter - in - law , I suppose . ”
33433	33443	33449	33449	he	119	“ I ’m sorry you lost them , Ian . ”
33444	33448	33449	33449	he	119	“ Me too , ”
33462	33472	33449	33449	he	119	“ And now I want to know about you . ”
33473	33482	33483	33483	I	0	“ There ’s not a lot to know . ”
33493	33520	33483	33483	I	0	“ I ’m an only child . My parents are in the middle of a divorce . You can say that ’s been hard to assimilate . ”

33553	33571	33572	33572	I	0	“ I guess you ’d know , since you ’re in the middle of one , too . ”
33609	33670	33671	33671	He	119	“ I guess life surprises us and not everything we plan ends up going as planned . I came to Manhattan to study at NYU . All I dreamed of was Broadway . But on my first audition , I broke my ankle , and voilà , I have n’t seen the stars smile down on me again since I … ”
33729	33752	33724	33724	I	0	“ My roomie just went through a sad breakup . Her best friend from Texas is in town to cheer her up . ”
33763	33796	33724	33724	I	0	“ We ’d better head back . I should get home . Tomorrow , I ’m promoting the launch of House of Sass on Prince Street and I need my beauty sleep . ”

34425	34447	34393	34393	he	870	“ He wanted you to free your afternoon and meet him tonight on Broadway . He ’s got tickets for Hairspray . ”
34448	34462	34463	34463	He	870	“ Oh my gosh , really ? But that show is sold out . ”

37628	37653	37625	37625	I	0	“ I ’m easy with you , but I like to keep the mystery , so do n’t think I ’ll always be easy . ”

38457	38464	38465	38465	He	119	“ Because it ’s confusing me . ”
38475	38486	38465	38465	He	119	“ You ’re confused because you ’re drunk , baby . ”
38523	38540	38541	38541	I	0	“ No . I ’m confused because I do n’t know what you want from me , ”

38816	38821	38822	38822	he	119	“ Ahh , Sara , ”
38829	38863	38822	38822	he	119	“ Looks like we ’ll only be sleeping tonight , baby . Only because you ’re drunk — and I do want you with all five senses when I ’m inside you again . ”
38917	38945	38911	38911	He	119	“ First thing I ’m getting tomorrow is sheets , satin ones . You deserve to get fucked on the best , do n’t you , peanut ? ”
38946	38975	38911	38911	He	119	“ I ’m going to let you dream about it , but that ’s no guarantee that I ’m coming back soon except for more of that wine . ”

46205	46215	46190	46190	he	119	” He raises one challenging brow . I groan . “
46246	46289	46234	46234	him	119	” His eyes flare ever so slightly , and the fire inside them suddenly feels too hot for the room . The city . The whole earth . Shifting forward as he digests my confession , Ian ’s voice drops a decibel . “

46629	46699	46617	46617	you	0	” His smile is wolfish , and his stare penetrating , and I ’m enjoying this far too much for it to be casual . Like Ian just said about me , there is nothing casual about this or my feelings for him . I try not to get too involved in the way he looks across the table . And the way his gaze stays focused on me . “

46913	46926	46927	46928	A lady	1099	” His voice is husky now , intimate . Like the setting . “

46941	46957	46939	46939	she	1099	” His thumb caresses mine as he smiles to himself , waiting for my reply . “
46978	47018	46968	46968	I	0	” I admit in a sultry whisper . I lift his hand to my lips and kiss the knuckle of his thumb ; then I lick it out of impulse . I ’m hungry . What can I say ? “
47036	47054	47027	47027	you	0	” He scrapes his thumb across my bottom lip , the caress causing my temperature to rise . “

66478	66493	66469	66469	He	1459	“ I ’m too busy fucking you . Huh . Who ’s fucking you ? ”
66494	66499	66500	66500	He	1459	“ You . Motherfu — ”
66515	66527	66528	66528	I	0	“ I wanted here . All fucking day I wanted here . ”
66543	66553	66540	66540	I	0	“ I want you here , Ian . Always . ”
66554	66577	66578	66578	He	1459	“ You do shit to me . I do n’t like it either , but it ’s there . It ’s here . ”

67426	67442	67404	67404	He	196	“ I ’ll say it again when we ’re both ready to deal with it . ”
67443	67449	67450	67450	He	196	“ What do you mean ? ”
67472	67479	67480	67480	He	196	“ Questions , questions , kitten . ”

67823	67833	67801	67801	Goldberg	140	“ One can never be certain about these things , ”
67838	67856	67834	67834	Mattias	79	“ but we have a good feeling about today . Assuming she turns up , of course . ”
68018	68032	68033	68033	she	78	“ Oh , this is what it has come to , has it ? ”
68036	68044	68033	68033	she	78	“ You ca n’t even acknowledge me ? ”
68068	68078	68079	68079	I	0	“ Thank you for finally joining us , Cordelia , ”
68100	68126	68127	68127	He	1479	“ Mrs. Ford , everything is as previously agreed , but please take your time to read over it again and then sign … here . ”
68141	68145	68146	68146	she	78	“ Mrs. Ford … ”
68159	68178	68146	68146	she	78	“ I suppose I ’ll have to get used to being called by my maiden name again soon . ”
68179	68197	68198	68198	Wahlberg	79	“ It ’s one of the conditions for granting you all of the assets that we are , ”
68207	68216	68217	68217	She	78	“ Mr. Ford would like his name back . ”
68324	68327	68328	68328	she	78	“ Ian , ”
68331	68360	68328	68328	she	78	“ please . I know you do n’t really want this . We ’re good together . We can try again . It ’ll be different this time . ”
68361	68380	68328	68328	she	78	“ It ’s too late , Cordelia . There ’s nothing you can say to change my mind . ”
68381	68384	68385	68385	she	78	“ Maybe , ”
68393	68407	68385	68385	she	78	“ But that does n’t mean I have to agree to the divorce . ”
68453	68463	68464	68464	she	78	“ I know why you want this so much , ”
68475	68489	68464	68464	she	78	“ It ’s what your dumb little floozy wants , is n’t it ? ”
68506	68513	68514	68514	I	0	“ Leave her out of this , ”

68583	68621	68580	68580	he	1482	“ However , I can assure you it will be to your detriment , financially speaking . Mr. Ford ’s offer is extremely generous , given the circumstances . And we have solid proof of your affair . ”
68622	68625	68626	68626	she	78	“ Proof ? ”
68639	68665	68629	68629	Her	78	“ Going through my credit card statements does n’t prove anything . And if Barry wants to testify , I have ways of discouraging him . ”
68696	68709	68692	68692	she	78	“ Technically , it ’s not your credit card , is it ? ”
68720	68729	68710	68710	Wahlberg	79	“ But that ’s irrelevant at this point . ”
68741	68780	68732	68732	her	78	“ Ian , we could forget about all this silliness and go back to how we used to be . Summers in Europe , winters in the Caribbean . You ca n’t deny what great times we had . ”
68884	68890	68891	68891	she	78	“ How did you … ? ”
68988	68998	68999	68999	he	1978	“ There ’s an additional note in the settlement , ”
69015	69039	68999	68999	he	1978	“ All copies of Barry ’s testimony will be destroyed , along with the video and photographs . As long as you sign . ”
69040	69046	69047	69047	she	78	“ Was this your idea ? ”
69053	69068	69047	69047	she	78	“ I ca n’t believe it ’s come to this , Ian . Really ? ”
69210	69223	69202	69202	Wahlberg	79	“ The paperwork for the purchase of the business , as discussed . ”
69224	69236	69237	69237	Cordelia	78	“ You ’re really putting what you have left into this ? ”
69244	69265	69237	69237	Cordelia	78	“ It ’s only money . I started with less than what I have now . I ’ll make do . ”
69266	69271	69319	69319	Wahlberg	79	“ I ’m jealous . ”
69272	69282	69283	69283	She	78	“ I know . And I do n’t care . ”
69633	69650	69651	69651	she	78	“ So , you ’re going to go and play house with your new little strumpet ? ”
69655	69670	69651	69651	she	78	“ I might , if you had n’t tainted the word house for me . ”
69671	69677	69626	69626	she	78	“ Fuck you , Ian . ”
69678	69685	69626	69626	she	78	“ Back at you , Cordelia . ”
69686	69721	69651	69651	she	78	“ She does n’t know what she ’s getting into . You ’re emotionally unavailable . Even to me , and I ’ve known you for years . All you want is to work . ”
69722	69742	69743	69743	I	0	“ Maybe . Because I actually cared about your happiness and your safety . But that ’s long gone . ”
69772	69777	69765	69765	I	0	“ Goodbye , Cordelia . ”
69935	69940	69941	69941	Ian	119	“ From the top , ”

70085	70113	70078	70078	He	119	“ I had to make some arrangements to be sure Cordelia was out of the picture — for good . Out of my life , and yours . ”
70114	70117	70118	70118	I	0	“ What ? ”
70200	70215	70184	70184	I	0	“ What did your ex want in exchange for selling you her production company ? ”
70216	70220	70221	70221	Ian	119	“ Not much , ”
70232	70243	70221	70221	Ian	119	“ She wanted me to let her keep my name . ”
70244	70249	70250	70250	I	0	“ You ca n’t ! ”
70345	70356	70357	70357	I	0	“ I mean … imagine if you ever married again , ”
70364	70383	70357	70357	I	0	“ There ca n’t be two Mrs. Fords , three including your Gran , walking around New York . ”
70384	70394	70395	70395	He	119	“ We ca n’t have that , can we ? ”
70416	70444	70445	70445	I	0	“ You said , Dancer , that you would n’t mind who your boss was , whether it was someone you hated or someone you cared for . ”

70555	70575	70551	70551	he	119	“ I suppose a girl I know would say it ’s for recovering my … faith in the universe . ”
70576	70582	70539	70539	he	119	“ A girl you know . ”
70594	70602	70551	70551	he	119	“ The girl I ’m deeply into . ”
70607	70611	70551	70551	he	119	“ How deep ? ”
70612	70619	70620	70620	He	119	“ As deep as love goes . ”
