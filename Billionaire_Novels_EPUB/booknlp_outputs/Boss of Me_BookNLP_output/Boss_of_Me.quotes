6713	6743	6707	6707	I	0	“ We ’re poised to be the leader in this field . Fletcher International will be synonymous with short - term commercial rentals , like Xerox is to copiers . ”

6880	6930	6931	6931	He	183	“ It ’s part of the reason we need to expand . Countries like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are looking for spaces in LA and New York . Once we have more properties on the books , they ’ll come pouring in . We find it , they come . ”
6957	6966	6967	6967	Stephen	183	“ You ’ve come pretty far pretty fast … ”
6982	6990	6967	6967	Stephen	183	“ But you ’re not there yet . ”
7009	7013	7014	7014	Hastings	183	“ Excuse me ? ”
7026	7062	7014	7014	Hastings	183	“ You need more big - ticket renters . Otherwise , we launch , and the US and European clients bypass us . They can do it themselves . Show me why they need this . ”
7085	7090	7091	7091	He	218	“ You ’re wrong . ”
7106	7159	7102	7102	He	218	“ We ’re already a concierge service . They do n’t want to bother with the real estate culture here , the security needs , the logistics . We have the experience and the contacts to make it seamless , and we offer only the best properties with top - notch security . ”
7160	7175	7176	7176	Stephen	183	“ I want to see bigger fish . Come back when you have them . ”
7204	7213	7214	7214	My	0	“ I wanted to work with you guys . ”

7306	7321	7300	7300	Remi	187	“ Sounds like a plan . Shoot me a message when you ’re ready . ”
7322	7330	7331	7331	Taron	218	“ You got it . Talk soon . ”
7364	7378	7379	7379	Taron	218	“ Fuck them . Braden Investments messaged me last week ready to go . ”
7394	7419	7389	7389	he	218	“ Braden wants a bigger piece of the profits , more control of which markets roll out and when . You will hate that . ”
7426	7433	7420	7420	He	218	“ So what are you saying ? ”
7434	7480	7481	7481	My	0	“ Give me a week . I ’m talking to Pro Partner and AmCham , both in Abu Dhabi and both interested . Raquel can help you with Madagascar , and I ’ll focus on securing them . Then I ’ll touch back with Remi . ”
7496	7509	7510	7510	I	0	“ One week , and we ’ll give them one last chance . ”
7529	7540	7541	7541	He	218	“ So why did you hire her of all people ? ”
7555	7564	7549	7549	his	218	“ She ’s good . We need her . ”
7565	7572	7549	7549	his	218	“ We do n’t need anybody . ”
7573	7595	7549	7549	his	218	“ We need Hastings and Key , and we need Raquel Morgan . She graduated at the top of her class . ”

7627	7630	7631	7631	He	218	“ Right . ”
7636	7659	7631	7631	He	218	“ That would go over great with our Nashville clients . They ’re still our biggest book of business , you know . ”
7660	7667	7549	7549	his	218	“ Remember when everybody spoke English ? ”
7668	7685	7631	7631	He	218	“ And the sun never set on the British Empire ? Yes , times have changed . ”
7699	7716	7693	7693	I	0	“ This is a small office . We work in close quarters . Women cause problems . ”
7717	7723	7631	7631	He	218	“ What are you saying ? ”
7724	7732	7745	7745	She	567	“ You should ’ve hired a man . ”
7781	7789	7779	7779	her	567	“ Hope I ’m not interrupting anything . ”
7882	7887	7875	7875	my	0	“ What is it ? ”

7929	7952	7903	7903	She	567	“ Of course . I thought you ’d want to know it ’s ready now rather than having to find it later . ”
8112	8124	8125	8125	He	218	“ I guess I ’ll get back to unpacking my desk . ”
8131	8137	8125	8125	He	218	“ How ’s it going ? ”
8192	8197	8198	8198	I	0	“ Going pretty well . ”

8290	8309	8310	8310	He	218	“ I figured I ’d move these into the drawers in the same order you have them here . ”
8313	8350	8310	8310	He	218	“ Familiarize yourself with them , but you do n’t need to memorize . All the details are on the server . You can access it with your phone . Did Sandra get you set up ? ”
8351	8354	8355	8355	I	0	“ Yep . ”

8666	8694	8654	8654	He	178	“ On your first day ? That ca n’t be right . We usually give a few days ’ grace period before we work you to death . ”

10477	10505	10506	10506	He	170	“ It ’s on hold . Taron wants to follow up on some leads in the UAE , and Hastings wants to see if we land them . ”
10513	10536	10506	10506	He	170	“ When I ran things , we did n’t do business with the Arabs . Or the Chinese . Or the Russians . ”
10563	10576	10560	10561	a diplomat	606	“ Taron ’s smart . He would n’t deal with questionable firms . ”

10605	10617	10506	10506	He	170	“ It would n’t be Fletcher International if we did that . ”
10618	10642	10560	10561	a diplomat	606	“ You know , you do n’t have to do this launch . We ’re making plenty of money in the Nashville market . ”
10643	10671	10672	10672	He	170	“ We do have to do it , and you ’ll be glad once it ’s done and the value of your shares goes through the roof . ”
10703	10737	10690	10690	he	170	“ Bill said Martin was on one of those gossip shows today . They ’ve got pictures of him partying with Sissy Faith . On a Tuesday . Is he having issues again ? ”

10768	10785	10786	10786	He	170	“ Tabloid gossip . Marley ’s working PR angles , picking up endorsements , you know . ”
10803	10830	10831	10831	I	0	“ I ’d hold off on partnering too quickly with young talent . You never know when they ’ll do something like twerk on national TV . ”

10885	10904	10839	10841	my aged father	612	“ I trust you ’re keeping an eye on him , getting him help if he needs it . ”
10905	10909	10970	10970	He	170	“ Of course . ”
10923	10946	10917	10917	I	0	“ You boys did a good service to our country . Still , I ca n’t have him mucking up our reputation — ”

10965	10969	10970	10970	He	170	“ Social media . ”
10983	10998	10976	10976	I	0	“ Nothing beats good old - fashioned , face - to - face interaction . ”
10999	11002	11024	11024	his	170	“ Right . ”

11176	11191	11128	11128	I	0	“ Cigars bring out the character in the wood . Cigarettes are just dirty . ”
11192	11199	11128	11128	I	0	“ Was that all you needed ? ”
11210	11234	11200	11200	I	0	“ If you ’re dead set on this expansion , lock down Hastings and Key . They ’re good people . Good Americans . ”
11235	11238	11128	11128	I	0	“ Right . ”
11239	11256	11200	11200	I	0	“ And get a handle on Martin . You do n’t need another situation with him . ”
11269	11274	11275	11275	I	0	“ Night , Dad . ”

11452	11457	11458	11458	He	170	“ Is it nine ? ”
11504	11512	11486	11486	He	170	“ You wo n’t believe what happened . ”
11524	11533	11519	11519	I	0	“ Sounds like something I wo n’t like . ”

12906	12954	12901	12901	Her	633	“ They stay outside except the ones who ’ve been declawed . It ’s such a cruel practice , declawing . It ’s like cutting off the tips of all your fingers , and as they get older , they develop arthritis making it painful to jump — ”
12955	12965	12781	12781	She	633	“ I ’ll never declaw a cat . Promise . ”

14362	14372	14352	14352	he	177	“ Ditch the cardigan . You ’re not eighty . ”

14477	14516	14467	14467	her	227	“ My notes … I guess I should stop by my office . I can drop this off while I ’m in there . It ’s not really that chilly in here . You never know , though . ”
14561	14568	14558	14558	she	227	“ You ’d better get going . ”
14611	14618	14619	14619	He	177	“ What took you so long ? ”

14665	14688	14648	14648	He	177	“ Do n’t start with that smart mouth in front of these guys . They ’re used to women knowing their place . ”
14689	14698	14699	14699	I	0	“ Is it a philosophy you agree with ? ”
14722	14738	14716	14716	he	177	“ It ’s possible they ’re onto something … when it comes to certain women . ”

14788	14803	14804	14804	He	177	“ So their email said they ’d like to conduct the meeting in French . ”
14820	14830	14804	14804	He	177	“ If they speak French , they speak English . ”
14831	14846	14804	14804	He	177	“ I ’m sure they speak English , but they want to speak French . ”
14847	14863	14864	14864	He	177	“ Makes everything take twice as long as it should . An annoying power move . ”
14934	14940	14941	14941	Patton	177	“ Good afternoon , gentlemen . ”
14946	14964	14941	14941	Patton	177	“ Raquel Morgan here is our new Director of International Affairs . She ’ll be our translator . ”

15795	15827	15786	15786	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry about the interruption . Martin has been dealing with some personal issues . He ’s not himself today … probably needs a day or two off . ”

16099	16143	16095	16095	Justin	210	“ Well , starting today , we ’re implementing a ten percent finder ’s fee on all new rentals , and the 24 - hour premium - level security you have here for free will be an additional fifteen hundred dollars a month . ”
16155	16176	16177	16177	Taylor	209	“ As it stands , you ’re set to save almost ten thousand dollars if we close the deal today . ”
16188	16206	16177	16177	Taylor	209	“ I have not heard any mention of premium - level security . It simply says security . ”
16207	16212	16177	16177	Taylor	209	“ Yes , well … ”
16218	16315	16316	16316	Patton	177	“ Based on client feedback , we ’ve decided to offer different levels of security . Our former service will become premium , with a security guard on site at all times and regular drive - by checks from local police . From there it will go all the way down to basic , which is just the drive - by without the on - site security guard . We ’ll customize it to meet clients ’ needs , but as your deal stands , you ’re getting the top of the line package for free . ”
16351	16383	16384	16384	They	698	“ Gentlemen , I ’m very sorry for the interruption . Our marketing director is a frustrated stand - up comic . I hope you were n’t offended by his jokes . ”

16559	16602	16551	16551	his	177	“ I did n’t think we needed to mention these changes , since you were ready to sign . But in case there ’s any hesitation , we do n’t want you to miss this opportunity . It ’s quite a deal . ”

57489	57508	57483	57483	He	218	“ The path steers away , because the ground turns into more of a bog in that direction . ”
57536	57541	57542	57542	He	218	“ Come with me . ”

58610	58967	58591	58591	he	218	” His mouth is at my ear , and his beard scratching my skin makes me moan . It feels so good . My nipples tingle . He pushes me onto my tiptoes with every desperate thrust of his cock . He hits my G - spot again and again until … Oh , God , yes … The orgasm shoots through my stomach like a rocket , leaving sizzling streams of pleasure in its wake . I open my mouth and the noise of pleasure is so loud and low , I sound feral . Patton ’s fist grips in the side of my hair , and he turns my face so he can cover my mouth with his . He consumes me , pushing his cock harder , deeper into my grasping core . Our tongues curl , our mouths move , and our lips nip and pull as we try to keep up with each other . My knees are liquid , but I ca n’t fall . He ’s holding me in his strong hands . Three more hard thrusts , and his body stills . He holds himself deep inside me , and I feel the pulsing of his cock . His ragged groans are in my ear , and I close my eyes , loving that sound . Loving all of this from the fresh spring waters to the earthy scent of the cave around us . He wraps one arm around my waist and the other around the front of my shoulders , holding my back flush against his hard chest . I love the feel of his hot skin melding to mine . I reach up and hold his strong forearm , resting my head against his shoulder and closing my eyes . For several beats of our hearts , we stay that way — the deep feeling of union here under this cascade of water , washing over both of us . All I can think is if this is wrong , if he ’s the devil , then take me to hell . I ’ll go willingly .

60519	60565	60499	60499	she	1342	“ To me the person makes the name attractive or not . Like I knew a guy named Thomas once , and he was such a dick . Now I hate that name . But I bet there are lots of nice men named Thomas … ”

67426	67433	67419	67419	Her	1462	“ I want to taste you . ”
67489	67493	67494	67494	She	1462	“ Come on . ”
67612	67615	67627	67627	she	1462	“ Rocky … ”
67813	67818	67797	67797	I	0	“ Fuck , yes . ”
68308	68420	68281	68281	her	1462	“ We ’ll be late if I do n’t call the car now . Are you ready ? ’ The room phone is between my shoulder and my ear , and I polish off my scotch . After a day of walking up and down Rodeo Drive , checking out the Walk of Fame , Warner Bros studios , driving on Sunset Boulevard with the Hollywood sign to our left and the Griffith Observatory to our right , I had worried she might be too exhausted for the gala . I was wrong . My little fighter insisted on getting ready in her own room tonight , much to my annoyance . “
68424	68440	68281	68281	her	1462	” I can hear the sounds of movement on the other end of the line . “
68458	68459	68449	68449	I	0	” “
68473	68758	68449	68449	I	0	” We disconnect , and I put my glass in the sink . Jerry checked in and let us know where he ’d be tonight . I ’m tempted to avoid that part of the building , but I ca n’t ignore my senior account exec , especially since I sent him here to get us established in the city . Or at least that ’s what I said . That motherfucker had better not put a finger on Rocky if he knows what ’s good for him . The elevator opens to the bustling lobby , and I make my way through a mix of appropriately and inappropriately dressed guests . The things people put on to wear in public amazes me — men in particular . I receive a text the car is out front , and when I look up , my surroundings seem to fade . Rocky steps off the elevator and takes my breath away . She ’s dressed in a floor - length , slate - blue dress with a halter top held up by thin spaghetti straps that crisscross over her shoulders down to her waist leaving her beautiful back exposed . Her hair is swept over one shoulder , and the way the top is cut , it gives a teasing glimpse of the curve of her breasts on the sides . The full effect is tantalizing . It makes me want to blow off the gala and take her upstairs … Clearly , we ca n’t do that . She closes the space between us , her blue skirt moving in filmy waves around her legs , and her lips curl into a sly grin . “
68769	68777	68449	68449	I	0	” I ’m pretty sure I have . “
68782	68834	68449	68449	I	0	” Reaching out , I slide my hand around her waist to the soft skin of her lower back and lean forward to kiss her cheek , just beside her ear . A shiver moves through her body , and damn . I really do want to blow off this gala . “
68845	68861	68449	68449	I	0	” She starts to laugh , taking my arm and turning me toward the door . “
68892	68912	68886	68886	Jerry	178	” The mention of his name is a boner - killer , and I put my hand over hers . “
68952	68967	68939	68939	I	0	” Her eyebrows rise , and I suppose I am being a bit forceful . “
68978	68990	68975	68976	Mr. Fletcher	193	” She keeps calling me that . It ’s unexpectedly erotic . “
69001	69026	68995	68995	I	0	” Our driver waits , holding the door , and she kisses my cheek , giving me a teasing , doe - eyed glance . “
69041	69062	68995	68995	I	0	” I climb in the car beside her , and I lower my gaze , giving her a heated look . “
69071	69071	68995	68995	I	0	”
69133	69141	69128	69128	Rocky	181	“ Let ’s get out and walk . ”
69159	69170	69142	69142	I	0	“ Are you sure ? It ’s a little ways … ”
69171	69176	69177	69177	She	1484	“ I ’m sure . ”
69232	69241	69224	69224	She	1484	“ You should wear this color more often . ”
69262	69271	69272	69272	She	1484	“ You might not get any work done … ”
69289	69297	69278	69278	I	0	“ I ’m very good at multitasking . ”
69356	69361	69347	69347	She	1484	“ Take my picture . ”

69431	69438	69445	69445	She	1484	“ Texting it to my phone . ”
69439	69444	69445	69445	She	1484	“ No … wait — ”
69470	69474	69457	69457	I	0	“ Sexy devil ? ”
69490	69495	69483	69483	her	1484	“ Is this me ? ”
69496	69501	69502	69502	She	1484	“ Give me that . ”
69539	69558	69530	69530	she	1484	“ It ’s rude to read someone else ’s phone . Has n’t anyone ever told you that ? ”
69559	69579	69530	69530	she	1484	“ You gave it to me to take your picture . I was just sending a copy to myself . ”
69580	69589	69592	69592	I	0	“ Next time I ’ll take a selfie . ”
69599	69619	69592	69592	I	0	“ Why are you embarrassed ? I feel like now I need to change your name in my phone . “
69627	69634	69592	69592	I	0	” She blinks up to me . “

69653	69677	69642	69642	PITA	268	” She pushes my arm and walks quickly toward the building . I laugh , catching up to her and taking her arm . “
69710	69762	69763	69763	Patton	218	” She shakes her head , and I thread our fingers again , leading her to the growing crowd of attendees waiting at the door to have their invitations checked against the master list . We ’re just at the front when I hear a voice that makes my neck tighten . “
69773	69833	69771	69771	Raquel	227	” Looking around , I see Jerry bobbing in the line , midway back and waving . Rocky moves away from me , sliding her hand out of mine . An acute sense of annoyance filters through my stomach . I ’m not smiling when I turn to find him moving through the crowd to where we ’re waiting . “
69846	69858	69771	69771	Raquel	227	” I murmur when he reaches us , shaking my hand . “
69868	69876	69864	69864	your	227	” he laughs , turning to Rocky . “
69887	69935	69936	69936	Angel	271	” He starts to move toward her , but she moves back . Instead , he quickly changes directions , pulling forward a blonde with a short pixie cut and a bright red dress . Angelique Johnson is our go - to realtor on the West Coast . “
69938	69954	69955	69955	Patton	218	” I lean forward in a brief hug , and she air kisses my cheek . “
69964	69965	69955	69955	Patton	218	” “
69977	69986	69987	69987	Angel	271	” Jerry motions between the three of us . “
70012	70018	70004	70004	She	227	” The woman smiles broadly . “
70035	70036	70038	70038	you	218	” “
70040	70044	70038	70038	you	218	” Rocky smiles . “
70053	70059	70051	70051	you	218	” Jerry jumps in again . “
70098	70169	70084	70084	She	227	” They both laugh at his corny joke , and Rocky forces a light titter . I look at her strangely , and her cheeks flush . Then her hand slides up the back of my arm and gives me a tiny pinch . My eyes narrow , and I smile , but it ’s a warning . Somebody wants to get spanked . Rocky returns to the other two . “
70190	70191	70084	70084	She	227	” “
70200	70232	70233	70233	I	0	” Angel takes her arm as we arrive at the front of the line . I hang back with Jerry showing our invitations and waiting for them to check the lists . “
70245	70259	70260	70260	You	0	” Jerry ’s studying me with an intensity I do n’t care for . “
70265	70269	70270	70270	I	0	” He nods , “
70283	70290	70291	70291	Raquel	227	” I did n’t expect it . “
70314	70329	70330	70330	You	0	” Anger flares in Jerry ’s eyes , and he takes a step back . “
70345	70361	70330	70330	You	0	” My jaw tightens , and I turn to face him , matching his tone . “
70379	70380	70372	70372	Raquel	227	” “
70399	70400	70394	70394	She	227	” “
70407	70423	70401	70401	You	0	” My tone is final , but he ’s turning my decision into a snub . “

70459	70460	70454	70454	Taron	218	” “
70467	70484	70485	70485	She	227	” Angel and Rocky stroll back to where we ’re speaking in low , heated tones . “
70492	70493	70485	70485	She	227	” “
70505	70535	70499	70499	she	227	” The ladies are back with us , and Rocky smiles , meeting my eyes . Our chemistry is strong , and I wait too long before blinking away . “
70539	70546	70499	70499	she	227	” Jerry ’s tone is cynical . “
70552	70553	70499	70499	she	227	” “
70557	70594	70499	70499	she	227	” Angel blinks between the two of us , but Jerry ’s eyes are fixed on me . He ’s grinning like he just figured out some new angle , and I do n’t like it . “
70603	70616	70601	70601	Ang	272	” He starts to go , but pauses after a few steps . “
70646	70673	70674	70674	We	1509	” As far as I ’m concerned , the conversation is closed , but I ’m not in the mood to deal with him right now . “

70706	70751	70758	70758	Raquel	227	” My eyes narrow , and I try to figure out what he ’s planning . Rocky is at my side , so I ’ll let it go for now , but this asshole better not think he ’s going to push me around . “
70756	70756	70758	70758	Raquel	227	”
70759	70773	70774	70774	We	1509	“ So far this is shaping up to be my favorite business trip . ”
70851	70862	70863	70863	He	218	“ You seemed to hit it off well with Angel . ”
70869	70874	70863	70863	He	218	“ She ’s nice . ”
70941	70950	70933	70933	I	0	“ Too bad we ’re heading home tomorrow . ”
70967	70980	70962	70962	He	218	“ I thought you were worried about leaving the Nashville office shorthanded . ”
70981	70991	70992	70992	We	1509	“ I did n’t know what I was missing . ”
71017	71027	71012	71012	I	0	“ What was going on with Jerry back there ? ”
71056	71062	71049	71049	they	482	“ Nothing . Shop talk . ”
71063	71074	71075	71075	He	218	“ It seemed like more than shop talk to me . ”
71090	71115	71075	71075	He	218	“ Jerry tends to get ideas in his head … he thinks he has more of a say in my decisions than he does . ”
71183	71195	71196	71196	I	0	“ He seems to be doing very well for himself here . ”
71231	71237	71238	71238	He	218	“ He ’s doing something . ”
71246	71276	71238	71238	He	218	“ I do n’t want to talk about Jerry . I ’m glad you ’re enjoying the trip . I ’ve enjoyed it more having you here with me . ”
71277	71287	71288	71288	I	0	“ It ’s still a business trip , right ? ”
71380	71409	71377	71377	he	184	“ I ’m sorry I wo n’t get to chat with Taron as much anymore , but I ’m sure Raquel and I will find something in common . ”
71410	71421	71422	71422	My	0	“ I look forward to working with you … Remington . ”
71430	71440	71427	71427	he	218	“ You can call me Remi . Everyone does . ”
71466	71481	71482	71482	Patton	218	“ Okay , Key , you do n’t have to land our business twice . ”
71506	71531	71503	71503	Remi	187	“ I hope this is a change for the better . It ’ll be nice to see you smiling more on our conference calls . ”
71540	71562	71532	71532	Patton	218	“ We ’re taking off . Give my best to Hastings . I ’ll give you both a call next week . ”
71563	71593	71594	71594	Patton	218	“ I ’ll be in Seattle for a few days , working with our software designers . I ’ll let you know when I ’m back in the office . ”
71597	71603	71594	71594	Patton	218	“ We ’ll chat then . ”
71604	71612	71613	71613	Remi	187	“ Nice to meet you , Raquel . ”
71682	71697	71698	71698	Patton	218	“ I ’ll take the lead when we meet with Keller Martin and Shelldrake . ”
71843	71860	71820	71820	he	218	“ I would n’t even know where to begin to take the lead in this meeting . ”
71861	71871	71876	71876	he	218	“ Good . You ’ll learn more by listening . ”
72066	72091	72049	72049	Patton	218	“ Our flight ’s in two hours . I do n’t expect this will take long . We ’re primarily putting faces to names . ”
72092	72095	72096	72096	I	0	“ Okay . ”
72168	72174	72163	72163	Patton	218	“ Where are the realtors ? ”
72175	72200	72201	72201	My	0	“ They ’re on the way . I figured this would give us time to chat about my promotion before you cut out early . ”
72238	72243	72244	72244	Patton	218	“ Is that right ? ”
72261	72270	72251	72251	he	218	“ You ’ve decided you deserve a promotion ? ”
72271	72300	72301	72301	Jerry	178	“ As a matter of fact , I have . And I think you ’re going to agree with me when you hear what I have to say . ”
72313	72319	72301	72301	Jerry	178	“ Should I wait outside ? ”
72333	72342	72326	72326	Patton	218	“ You ’re fine . Have a seat . ”
72343	72359	72360	72360	I	0	“ Yes , please stay , Raquel . Some of this concerns you as well . ”

72521	72542	72543	72543	Patton	218	“ You ’re promoting Miss Morgan here into Taron ’s role as VP of client development . Is that right ? ”
72549	72569	72543	72543	Patton	218	“ That ’s right . She has the credentials , and she ’s proven her ability in the office . ”
72570	72600	72601	72601	Patton	218	“ After only a few weeks , whereas I ’ve been with Fletcher International five years , and I ’ve been exiled to the farthest reaches of the country . ”
72610	72631	72601	72601	Patton	218	“ I ’d hardly call heading up our West Coast division exile . Some people actually like it out here . ”
72632	72640	72641	72641	Jerry	178	“ We ’ve already had that conversation . ”
72679	72715	72669	72669	Jerry	178	“ I assume along with Miss Morgan ’s promotion , she ’ll be getting a salary increase and an increased share of the company , not to mention a stronger voice in our administrative meetings ? ”
72716	72720	72721	72721	Patton	218	“ Of course . ”
72803	72842	72800	72800	Jerry	178	“ You ’re going to promote me to VP as well , and I expect to be paid a salary commiserate with my level of experience and the clients I ’ve developed during my years with this firm . ”
72843	72855	72856	72856	Patton	218	“ Is this really how you ’re going to handle this ? ”
72873	72910	72870	72870	Jerry	178	“ There ’s nothing to handle . You ’re going to give me what I deserve , or I ’m going to go public about what ’s happening behind the scenes at your father ’s company . ”
72911	72916	72917	72917	Patton	218	“ What you deserve ? ”
72935	72982	72917	72917	Patton	218	“ Fletcher International is my company . It ’s a private company . Going public with anything will only make you look like a sore loser — and you lost to a woman . Is that the kind of limelight you want to have on you ? ”
72983	72986	72987	72987	Jerry	178	“ Limelight ? ”
72994	72997	72987	72987	Jerry	178	“ Limelight … ”
73011	73049	72998	72998	He	178	“ What about the kind of limelight that sweeps sexual assault under the rug ? You bring up women , what about the kind of limelight that drives out aspiring young female employees to protect your friends ? ”
73064	73072	73073	73073	Patton	218	“ Are you trying to blackmail me ? ”
73088	73137	73079	73079	He	218	“ Blackmail ? Oh , no , I simply think it ’s an interesting contradiction . Tell me , when you ’re finished sleeping with Miss Morgan here , will you make her look insane like her sister ? Will you drive her out of Nashville as well ? ”
73157	73160	73161	73161	My	0	“ Patton ? ”
73166	73173	73161	73161	My	0	“ What is he talking about ? ”

73188	73193	73185	73185	his	218	“ Renée had issues … ”
73194	73197	73198	73198	Jerry	178	“ Yes , ”
73204	73221	73198	73198	Jerry	178	“ Issues she brought to you to fix . Issues that threatened your old boys club . ”
73222	73226	73227	73227	My	0	“ You hypocrite . ”
73235	73255	73227	73227	My	0	“ You ’re mad because you grabbed my ass repeatedly and Patton sent you here to avoid a lawsuit . ”
73263	73337	73256	73256	Jerry	178	“ The hypocrite , Raquel , is your boyfriend . Why do n’t you ask him what he did to your sister when his beloved Marley set his sights on her . He sent me out of town ? He drove your sister to the nuthouse . Then he ruined her reputation with all his CEO friends . She could n’t get a job in Nashville if her name was Dolly Fucking Parton . ”
73449	73460	73443	73443	Patton	218	“ Clean out your desk . You ’re finished here . ”
73461	73475	73476	73476	Patton	218	“ With pleasure . I got a better offer anyway — with Braden . ”
73481	73486	73476	73476	Patton	218	“ Then why … ? ”
73495	73508	73487	73487	Jerry	178	“ Because this time , you do n’t get away with it . ”
73523	73549	73550	73550	He	218	“ Oh , and no realtors are coming . I cancelled our meeting first thing this morning . Good luck establishing your West Coast division . ”
73607	73610	73611	73611	My	0	“ Patton ? ”
73631	73641	73621	73621	He	218	“ Please explain what he said about my sister . ”
73655	73676	73621	73621	He	218	“ I did n’t know how to have this conversation with you . I did n’t know what to say . ”

73696	73702	73691	73691	my	0	“ I protected my friend . ”
73703	73707	73621	73621	He	218	“ From what ? ”
73715	73720	73721	73721	I	0	“ A young woman ? ”
73771	73792	73793	73793	He	1554	“ She never filed a formal complaint . She asked me to talk to him , to make him stop … ”
73809	73839	73800	73800	he	1554	“ I ’d only been CEO a few years . I was still fighting with my dad for control . The last thing I needed was a Marley scandal . ”
73849	73854	73800	73800	he	1554	“ He raped her ? ”
73855	73858	73859	73859	His	1554	“ No . ”
73878	73892	73871	73871	he	1554	“ God , no . I do n’t think it went that far . ”

One week he stopped by my office with an ice cream cone or the next week he ’d say he bumped into a guy selling flowers , so he bought me one … That kind of thing . It was sweet . ”

81118	81166	81107	81107	She	1682	“ It was a really great kiss . I guess that ’s when I started thinking of him as more than just a work friend . Then it got to where we ’d slip into the break room or the supply closet at work and make out … ”

81280	81299	81300	81300	Her	1682	“ Because the rates of STDs have been skyrocketing in recent years . Have you heard about this ? ”
81310	81313	81306	81306	I	0	“ No ? ”
81314	81345	81219	81219	She	1682	“ The CDC has reported a rise in the number of syphilis cases … Syphilis ! Not to mention herpes is rampant . And the medicines have terrible side effects … ”

81391	81433	81219	81219	She	1682	“ He would n’t get tested . He said he ’d just use a condom , but I said what happens if the condom breaks ? What happens when he ’s pulling out ? A drop of semen could escape and — ”

81461	81516	81456	81456	she	1682	“ I do n’t know . Everyone ’s so quick to jump into bed these days . I liked being his friend . I liked kissing him … I hoped Patton might talk to him for me . They were practically brothers . I hoped he would tell him to stop with the pressure . ”
81517	81530	81531	81531	My	0	“ Instead he fired you . He ran you out of town . ”

81590	81635	81584	81584	She	1685	“ It was more what he said . I ’ll be the first to admit making out at work is unprofessional , but Patton made it sound like … He looked at me with those black eyes and asked me how much I wanted . ”
81636	81642	81556	81556	she	1685	“ How much … what ? ”
81643	81689	81690	81690	Her	1685	“ Money . He thought I wanted money . I guess he thought I was trying to blackmail him or something … I do n’t know . He said if I tried to turn it into some kind of scandal , he ’d bury me . ”
81694	81722	81690	81690	Her	1685	“ But I did n’t want a scandal . I liked Marley … He seemed so sad , but sweet . I still think about him sometimes . ”

81835	81853	81830	81830	I	0	“ Or maybe you just crossed paths with the devil . Another firm might be completely different . ”

82346	82388	82389	82389	He	1688	“ You read the trades . Make notes of which companies are doing short , eighteen - month to three - year deals in the states and where . Then you cold call . Or cold - email , I guess . ”

82514	82555	82556	82556	My	0	“ That right there ’s a mistake . Your social media marketing is your most powerful tool . You should give it to someone who knows this company inside and out and cares about it as much as you do . ”

Her lender contacted her previous employers , and when they said she was going to be denied , I asked what it would take to approve it . ”
