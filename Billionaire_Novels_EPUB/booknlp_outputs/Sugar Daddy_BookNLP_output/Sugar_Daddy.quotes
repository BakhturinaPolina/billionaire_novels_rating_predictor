33003	33023	32996	32996	I	0	" No , he 's just a friend now . What about you ? Are you going with someone ? "
33024	33029	33030	33030	Hardy	194	" No one special . "
33043	33064	33030	33030	Hardy	194	" Liberty ... have you talked to your mom about the amount of time you 're spending with the baby ? "
33065	33071	33072	33072	He	194	" What do you mean ? "
33079	33134	33135	33135	He	194	" You know what I mean . All this babysitting . Waking up with her every night . She seems more like your baby than your baby sister . It 's a lot for you to handle . You need time for yourself .. .have fun .. .go out with friends . And boyfriends . "
33156	33162	33163	33163	he	194	" You look so tired . "
33166	33173	33163	33163	he	194	" It makes me want to — "

33283	33286	33280	33280	Hardy	194	" Okay . "
33296	33299	33290	33290	he	194	" Hardy . "
33302	33309	33310	33310	I	0	" He stopped without looking back . "
33312	33330	33310	33310	I	0	" My voice wobbled , and I had to take a deep breath before I went on . "
33343	33352	33331	33331	I	0	" He still did n't look at me . "
33366	33367	33361	33361	I	0	" "

33383	33450	33376	33376	I	0	" The door closed with a quiet click . I threw away the empty pizza box and plastic cups and wiped off the table and counters . The weariness was coming back again , but this time I had reason to hope I might survive the next day . Hardy returned with Carrington , who was quiet and yawning , and I rushed to take her . "
33458	33481	33451	33452	Sweet baby	1255	" I crooned . She settled into her usual position on my shoulder , her head a warm weight against my neck . "
33486	33490	33482	33482	She	1255	" Hardy said . "
33525	33526	33527	33527	Hallelujah	258	" "
33529	33534	33527	33527	Hallelujah	258	" I said feelingly . "
33540	33555	33535	33535	You	194	" He touched my face , his thumb smoothing the wing of my eyebrow . "
33586	33587	33589	33589	you	194	" "
33591	33595	33589	33589	you	194	" I said . "
33617	33630	33631	33631	Liberty	196	" His fingertips came to my lips with feather - light pressure . "
33633	33637	33631	33631	Liberty	196	" he whispered . "
33649	33654	33642	33642	I	0	" I swallowed painfully . "
33663	33670	33671	33671	I	0	" He knew what I meant . "
33679	33713	33671	33671	I	0	" Slowly he lowered his forehead to mine , with the baby cradled between us . I closed my eyes , thinking , Let me love you , Hardy , just let me . "
33722	33726	33671	33671	I	0	" he murmured . "
33740	33934	33737	33738	a friend	621	" I turned my face until my mouth touched the shaven smoothness of his skin . His breath caught , and he did n't move . I nuzzled into the pliancy of his cheek , the hardness of his jaw , loving the texture of him . We stayed like that for a few seconds , not quite kissing , suffused with each other 's nearness . It had never been like this with Gill or any other boy , my bones turning liquid , my body shaken with cravings that had no previous reference point . Wanting Hardy was different from wanting anyone else . Lost in the moment , I was slow to respond when I heard the door open with a rattle . My mother had come back . Hardy pulled back from me , his face wiped clean of expression , but the air was weighted with emotion . Mama entered the trailer , her arms filled with a jacket , keys , and a take - out box from the restaurant . She took in the scene with a single glance and shaped her mouth into a smile . "
33945	33954	33955	33955	He	194	" I jumped in before he could reply . "
33971	33972	33969	33969	Mama	190	" "
33976	34012	33969	33969	Mama	190	" She set her things on the kitchenette counter , and came to take the baby from me . Carrington protested the change of arms , her head bobbing , her face flooding with color . "
34015	34045	34046	34046	Hardy	194	" Mama soothed , bouncing her in gentle repetition until she subsided . Hardy murmured goodbye and went to the door . Mama spoke in a carefully calibrated tone . "
34074	34140	34059	34059	I	0	" I drew in a hissing breath . To deliberately drive a wedge between me and Hardy , when we had done nothing wrong , seemed an ugly hypocrisy coming from a woman who 'd just had a fatherless baby . I wanted to say that , and worse things . Hardy spoke before I could , his bleak gaze locked with my mother 's . "
34147	34276	34277	34277	Liberty	196	" He left the trailer . I wanted to scream at my mother , to hurl words at her like a shower of darts . She was selfish . She wanted me to pay for Carrington 's childhood with my own . She was jealous that someone might care for me when there was no man in her life . And it was n't fair of her to go out with her friends so often , when she should want to stay at home with her newborn . I wanted to say those things so badly , I nearly suffocated beneath the weight of unspoken words . But it has always been my nature to turn my anger inward , like a Texas skink eating its own tail . "
34279	34283	34277	34277	Liberty	196	" Mama began gently .
34284	34291	34292	34292	I	0	" I 'm going to bed , "
34310	34318	34301	34301	her	1260	" I 've got a test tomorrow . "
34570	34577	34578	34578	Mama	190	" You do it , Liberty , "
34581	34595	34578	34578	Mama	190	" She wo n't hold it against you like she would someone else . "I
34627	34635	34636	34636	I	0	" I wish it could be me , "
34643	34659	34636	34636	I	0	" I would take it for you . I would take a hundred of them . "
34785	34786	34783	34783	Liberty	196	""There isn't?"She
34810	34825	34826	34826	she	193	" It 's a lie when they say you love all your children equally , "
34830	34849	34826	34826	she	193	" You do n't . There 's always a favorite . And you 're your mother 's favorite . ""I
34857	34875	34876	34876	She	193	""Your mama will take to her in time . It 's not always love at first sight . "
34895	34906	34876	34876	She	193	" Sometimes you have to get to know each other . ""It
34913	34926	34927	34927	Liberty	196	" I protested . Miss Marva 's cheeks jiggled as she chuckled . "
34935	35008	34927	34927	Liberty	196	"For once her laugh was not a happy sound . I knew without asking that she was thinking about her own daughter , a woman named Marisol who lived in Dallas and never came to visit . Miss Marva had once described Marisol . the product of a brief and long - ago marriage , as a troubled soul , given to addictions and obsessions and relationships with men of low character . "What
35014	35046	34927	34927	Liberty	196	" I had asked Miss Marva when she told me about Marisol . expecting her to lay out logical reasons as neatly as balls of cookie dough on a baking sheet . "God
35049	35129	34927	34927	Liberty	196	" Miss Marva had replied , simply and without bitterness . From that and other conversations , I gathered that on questions of nature versus nurture , she was firmly on the side of the former . Me , I was n't so sure . Whenever I took Carrington out people assumed she was mine , despite the fact that I was black haired and amber skinned , and she was as fair as a white - petaled daisy . "
35136	35164	35165	35165	Mexicans	3296	" I heard a woman say behind me . as I pushed Carrington1 s stroller through the mall . And a masculine voice replied in patent disgust . "
35190	35191	34927	34927	Liberty	196	" "
35198	35281	34927	34927	Liberty	196	" the woman admonished . I quickened my pace and turned into the next store I could reach , my face burning with shame and anger . That was the stereotype — Mexican girls were supposed to have sex early and often , breed like rabbits , have volcanic tempers , and love to cook . Every now and then a circular would appear on the racks near the supermarket entrance , containing pictures and descriptions of Mexican mail - order brides . "
35288	35293	34927	34927	Liberty	196	" the circular said . "
35342	35720	35325	35326	Mexican women	1290	" Living so close to the border , Tex - Mex women were often subject to the same expectations . I hoped no man would ever make the mistake of thinking / would be happy to put him and his career first . My junior year seemed to go quickly . Mama 's disposition had improved considerably , thanks to the antidepressants the doctor had prescribed . She regained her figure and her sense of humor , and the phone rang often . Mama seldom brought her dates to the trailer , and she hardly ever spent a full night away from Carrington and me . But there were still those odd disappearances when she would be gone for a day and come back without a word of explanation . After these episodes she was always calm and strangely peaceful , as if she 'd gone through a period of prayer and fasting . I did n't mind her leaving . It always seemed to do her good , and I had no problem taking care of Carrington by myself . I tried to rely on Hardy as little as possible , because seeing each other seemed to bringus more frustration and unhappiness than pleasure . Hardy was determined to treat me as if I were a younger sister , and I tried to comply , but the pretense was awkward and ill - fitting . Hardy was busy with land clearing and other brutal labor that toughened him in body and spirit . The mischievous twinkle of his eyes had cooled into a flat , rebellious stare . His lack of prospects , the fact that other boys his age were going to college while he seemed to be going nowhere , was eating away at him . Boys in Hardy 's position had few choices after high school other than to take a petrochem job with Sterling or Valero , or go into road construction . When I graduated , my choices were n't going to be any better . I had no special talents that would afford me a scholarship anywhere , and so far I had n't even taken any summer jobs that would have given me experience to put on a resume . "

36898	36906	36907	36907	she	190	" He seems like a nice boy . "
36912	36936	36907	36907	she	190	" If you want to date him . I 'll allow it as long as you keep to an eleven - thirty curfew . ""Thank
36941	36961	36907	36907	she	190	" I was grateful that she had given her permission , but some inner devil prompted me to say , "
36974	36980	36962	36962	He	262	"She understood my unspoken question . "
36987	37677	36962	36962	He	262	"I knew why she 'd said that . At nineteen , Hardy had already become more of a man than some men ever were . In the absence of a father he 'd learned to shoulder the responsibility of a family , providing for his mother and sisters . He 'd worked hard to ensure their survival , and his own . Luke , by contrast , was sheltered and coddled , secure in the belief that things would always come easily to him . If I had n't known Hardy , it was possible I would have come to care more about Luke . But it was too late for that . My emotions had bent around Hardy like wet - molded leather left to dry and harden in the sun , until any attempt to alter its shape would break it . One night Luke brought me to a party held at someone 's house while their parents were away for the weekend . The place was filled with seniors , and I looked in vain for a familiar face . The hard blues rock of Stevie Ray Vaughan blasted from outside patio speakers , while plastic cups of orange liquid were handed out to the crowd . Luke brought some to me , advising me with a laugh not to drink it too fast . It tasted like flavored rubbing alcohol . I took the tiniest sips possible , the caustic liquor stinging my lips . While Luke stood talking with his friends , I excused myself by asking where the restroom was . Gripping the plastic cup , I went into the house and pretended not to notice the couples making out in shadows and corners . I found the guest bathroom , which was miraculously unoccupied , and I poured the drink into the commode . When I emerged from the bathroom , I decided to take a different route outside . It would be easier , not to mention less embarrassing , to go out the front door and around the side of the house rather than return through the gauntlet of amorous couples . But as I passed the big staircase in the entranceway , I caught sight of a pair of entwined bodies in a shadow . I felt as if I 'd been stabbed through the heart as I recognized Hardy , his arms around a long - limbed blond girl . She was riding one of his thighs , her upper back and shoulders revealed by a black velvet bustier top . One of his fists was closed in her hair , holding it back as he dragged his mouth slowly along the side of her throat . Pain , desire , jealousy ... I had n't known it was possible to feel so many things so strongly , all at once . It took every ounce of will I possessed to ignore them and keep going . My steps faltered , but I did n't stop . Out of the corner of my eye , I saw Hardy 's head lift . I wanted to die as I realized he 'd seen me . My hand shook as I grasped the cold brass doorknob and let myself outside . I knew he would n't come after me , but my pace quickened until I was half running to the patio . The breath shot from my lungs in hard bursts . I longed to forget what I had just seen , but the image of Hardy with the blond girl was permanently seared in my memory . It shocked me , the fury I felt toward him , the white heat of betrayal . It did n't matter that he 'd promised nothing , owed nothing to me . He was mine . I felt it in every cell of my body . Somehow I managed to find Luke in the crowd on the patio , and he looked at me with a questioning smile . He could hardly fail to notice the burning color of my cheeks . "
37684	37689	37690	37690	I	0	doll?""I dropped my drink , "
37705	37713	37694	37694	He	1346	" I 'll get you another one . ""No
37717	37729	37715	37715	I	0	" I stood on my toes to whisper in his ear . "
37736	37743	37694	37694	He	1346	now?""Now ? We just got here . ""I
37751	37756	37694	37694	He	1346	" I whispered desperately . "
37767	38117	37759	37759	Luke	262	"His expression changed . I knew he was wondering if my sudden desire to be alone with him could mean what he thought it meant . And the answer was yes . I wanted to kiss him , hold him , do everything Hardy was doing at that exact moment with another girl . Not out of desire , but furious grief . There was no one I could go to . My mother would dismiss my feelings as childish . Maybe they were , but I did n't care . I had never felt this kind of consuming anger before . My only anchor was the weight of Luke 's arm . Luke took me to the public park , which contained a man - made lake and several wooded copses . At the side of the lake there was a ramshackle open - sided gazebo lined with splintery wood benches . Families went there to picnic in the daytime . Now the gazebo was empty and dark . The air rustled with night sounds , an orchestra of frogs croaking among the cattails , a mockingbird 's song , the flap of herons ' wings . Just before we had left the party , I had chugged the rest of Luke 's tequila sunrise . My head was spinning , and I reeled between waves of giddiness and nausea . Luke laid his jacket on the gazebo bench and pulled me onto his lap . He kissed me , his mouth wet and searching . I tasted the purpose in his kiss , the message that tonight he would go as far as I would let him . His smooth - skinned hand slipped beneath my shirt , over my back , plucking at the clasp of my bra . The underwire garment loosened across my chest . Immediately he reached around to my front , finding the tender curve of a breast , capturing it in a rough squeeze . I winced , and he loosened his grip a little , saying with a shaky laugh , "
38135	38675	38677	38677	baby	1346	" His thumb rubbed over the hardening tip of my breast . He pinched and chafed my nipples insistently , while our mouths moved together in long unbroken kisses . Soon my breasts were raw and sore . I gave up any hope of feeling pleasure and tried instead to simulate it . If something was wrong , it was my fault , because Luke was experienced . It must have been the tequila that gave me the sense of being an outside observer as Luke pushed me off his lap and onto the jacket - covered bench . The impact of the wood against my shoulders struck a flare of panic in my midsection , but I ignored it and lay back . Luke tugged at the fastenings of my jeans and pushed them down over my hips and off one leg . I saw a section of sky from beneath the gazebo roof . It was a misty night with no stars or moon . The only light came from the distant blue glow of a street lamp , flickering from a moth storm . Like any average teenage boy , Luke understood next to nothing about the more subtle erogenous areas on a woman 's body . I knew even less than he , and being too timid to volunteer what I did or did n't like , I passively let him do what he would . I had no idea where to put my hands . I felt him reach beneath my panties , where the hair was warm and flattened . More rubbing , a few times roughly grazing the sensitive place that made me jump . He gave an excited half - laugh , mistaking my discomfort for enjoyment . Luke 's body was broad and heavy as he lowered himself until my legs stiffly bracketed his . He groped between us , unzipping his jeans , using both hands to accomplish some hurried task . I heard the sound of crackling plastic , and felt him pulling at something , arranging it , and then there was the unfamiliar taut , bobbing length of him against my inner thigh . He pushed my shirt and bra up higher , bunching them beneath my chin . His mouth was at my breast , pulling tightly . I thought we had probably gone too far to stop , that I had no right to say no at this point . I wished it was over , that he would finish soon . Even as that thought crossed my mind , the pressure between my legs became bruising . I tensed and gritted my teeth , and looked up at Luke 's face . He did n't look back at me . He was focused on the act itself , not on me . I had become nothing more than the instrument by which he would gain relief . He shoved harder , harder into my resistant flesh , and a pained sound broke from my lips . It only took a few searing thrusts , the condom turning slick from blood , and then he was shuddering against me . groaning in his throat . "Oh
38684	38795	38677	38677	baby	1346	"I kept my arms around him . A ripple of revulsion ran through me as I felt him kiss my neck , his breath like steam on my skin . It was enough — he'd had enough of me — I needed to belong to myself again . I was relieved beyond measure when he lifted away , my flesh raw and hurting . We dressed ourselves silently . I had held all my muscles so tightly that when I finally relaxed , they began to tremble from the strain . I trembled all over until even my teeth chattered . Luke drew me against him . patting my back . "
38800	38869	38797	38797	you	1350	" he asked , his voice low . He did n't expect me to say yes , and I would n't . It seemed bad manners somehow , and it would n't change anything . What was done was done . But I wanted to go home . I wanted to be alone . Only then could I start to catalog the changes that had occurred in me . "No
38871	38885	38797	38797	you	1350	" I mumbled against his shoulder . He patted my back some more . "
38919	38995	38913	38913	she	1351	"I stiffened a little . No girl wanted to hear about a previous girlfriend at such a time . And although I was n't surprised that Luke had had sex with a virgin before , it rankled . It seemed to lessen the value of what I 'd given him . As if being someone 's first lover was a commonplace occurrence for him , Luke , the kind of boy virgins threw themselves at . "Please
38997	39001	38913	38913	she	1351	" I said , "
39011	39016	38913	38913	she	1351	""Of course , baby . "On
39331	39336	39323	39323	He	262	"Bye . baby doll . ""Bye
39340	39875	39323	39323	He	262	"A lamp in the main room had been left on : but Mama and the baby were asleep . Thankfully I went to get my pajamas , carried them to the bathroom , and ran the hottest shower I could tolerate . Standing in the near - scalding water , I scrubbed hard at the rusty smears on my legs . The heat eased the clustering aches , water pouring over me until my skin no longer seemed imprinted with the feel of Luke . By the time I stepped from the shower . I was parboiled . I dressed in my pajamas and went to my room , where Carrington was beginning to wriggle in her crib . Wincing at the soreness between my legs , I hurried to get a bottle ready . She was awake by the time I came back to her , but for once she was n't screaming . She was waiting patiently , as if she knew I needed some forbearance . She reached for me with chubby amis and clung to my neck as I brought her to the rocker . Carrington smelled like baby shampoo and diaper cream . She smelled like innocence . Her small body conformed to mine exactly , and she patted my hand as I held the bottle forher . Her blue - green eyes stared into mine . I rocked in the languid motion she liked best . With each soft forward pitch , the tightness in my chest and throat and head disintegrated until tears began to leak from the outward corners of my eyes . No one on earth , not Mama . not even Hardy , could have consoled me as Carrington did . Grateful for the relief of tears . I continued to cry silently as I fed and burped the baby . Instead of putting Carrington back in her crib , I took her in bed with me , putting her on the side against the wall . It was something Miss Marva had advised me never to do . She had said the baby would never willingly go back in her crib alone again . As usual , Miss Marva was right . From that night on Carrington insisted on sleeping with me , erupting in coyote howls if I ever tried to ignore her upraised arms . And the truth was . I loved sleeping with her , the two of us snuggled together beneath the rose - patterned duvet . I fieured if I needed her . and she needed me . it was our right as sisters to comfort each other . CHAPTER 9 Luke and I did not sleep together often , both from lack of opportunity — neither of us had our own place — and because it was obvious that no matter how I pretended to enjoy it , I did n't . We never discussed the situation directly . Whenever we did go to bed together , Luke would try this or that , but nothing he did seemed to matter . I could n't explain to him or myself why I was a failure in bed . "Funny
39877	39909	39323	39323	He	262	" Luke commented one afternoon , lying with me in his bedroom after school . His parents had gone to San Antonio for the day , and the house was empty . "
39935	39953	39956	39956	you	0	" He paused , cupping his hand over my naked hip . I knew what he meant . "That
39964	40006	39956	39956	you	0	" I said . His chest moved beneath my ear as he chuckled . I had confided my problem to Lucy : who had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was now going with the assistant manager at the cafeteria . "
40014	40021	40007	40007	You	1358	" she had told me authoritatively . "
40074	40089	40090	40090	Luke	262	""I wo n't have to . He 's leaving for Baylor in two weeks . "
40692	40699	40700	40700	Mama	190	"This must be a million calories , "
40798	40803	40805	40805	I	0	" Hey . there . "Mama

41165	41169	41160	41160	She	190	" Yes , have you?""Tight
41174	41457	41160	41160	She	190	" he replied , patting the belted jut of his stomach . Although there was n't anything remotely clever about what he 'd said , Mama astonished me by laughing . She looked at him in a way that sent a creeping sensation down the back of my neck . Her gaze , her posture , the way she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear , all of it conveyed an invitation . I could n't believe it . Mama knew about his reputation just as I did . She had even made fun of him to me and Miss Marva , saying he was a small - town redneck who thought he was a big shot . She could n't possibly have been attracted to Sadlek — it was obvious he was n't good enough for her . But neither was Flip , or any of the other men I had ever seen her with . I puzzled over the common denominator between all of them , the mysterious thing that drew Mama to the wrong men . In the piney woods of East Texas , pitcher plants attract bugs with an advertisement of bright yellow trumpets and red veins . The trumpets are filled with sweet - smelling juice that insects ca n't resist . But once a bug crawls into the pitcher , it ca n't get back out . Sealed in the crisp interior of the pitcher plant , it drowns in sugar water and is consumed . As I looked at Mama and Louis Sadlek , I saw the same alchemy at work , the false advertising , the attraction , the danger ahead . "Bull

41548	41593	41523	41523	Mama	190	" He played with Carrington . flicking the lobe of her ear , making her gurgle and coo . And Mama , who was usually so critical of people 's language , did n't say one word about swearing in front of the baby . "I
41604	41614	41615	41615	Liberty	196	" I snapped . Mama gave an exasperated sigh . "

45261	45292	45255	45255	I	0	" I felt the hot strikes of his breath on my cheek . His arms wrapped around me , stifling all movement . His heart pounded against my flattened breasts . "

45466	45653	45463	45463	I	0	"I hated him for regarding me as part of a trap he had to escape from . He bent his head to kiss me , the salt taste of my tears vanishing between our lips . I stiffened , but he urged my mouth open and kissed me more deeply , and I was lost . He found every weakness with diabolical gentleness , gathering sensation as if it were honey to be lapped up with his tongue . His hand coasted over the seam of my thighs and urged them apart , and before I could close them again his body was there . Murmuring softly , he helped me to wrap my arms around his neck , and his lips returned to mine , ravishing slowly . No matter how I squirmed and strained , I could n't get close enough . I wanted nothing less than the full weight of him on me , full possession , full surrender . I pushed the hat from his head and sank my fingers into his hair , pulling his mouth harder , harder against mine . "Easy
45655	45670	45463	45463	I	0	" Hardy whispered , lifting his head , gripping my shivering body against his . "
45677	45925	45675	45675	honey	3123	"I fought for breath and sat there with the wooden rail digging into my backside , my knees clamped on his hips . He would n't give me his mouth again until I quieted , and then his kisses were soothing , his lips absorbing the sounds that climbed in my throat . His hand moved up and down my spine in repeated strokes . Slowly he brought his palm to the undercurve of my breast , caressing me over the fabric of my shirt , and his thumb swirled gently until he found the hardening tip . My arms became weak , too heavy to lift , and I lent more of my weight to him , resting on him like a Friday - night drunk . I understood how it would be with him , how different from the times I 'd slept with Luke . Hardy seemed to drink in every nuance of my response , every sound and shiver and respiration . He held me as if the weight of me were precious in his arms . I lost track of how long he kissed me , his mouth alternately gentle and demanding . The tension built until low whimpers broke from my throat , and my fingertips scrabbled over the surface of his shirt , desperate for the feel of his skin . He took his mouth from mine and buried his face in my hair , struggling to control his breathing . "No
45927	45931	45675	45675	honey	3123	" I protested . "

49589	49619	49586	49586	he	278	" There 's people who like to plan and those who take life as it comes . Nothing wrong with either way . I 'm a planner , myself . ""So
49623	49891	49621	49621	I	0	" I said , although that was n't at all true . I had always followed Mama 's example , taking life as it came . But now I wanted to be different . I had to be . Opening a book of laminated price sheets , Mr. Ferguson led me into the subject of the funeral budget . There was a long list of things that needed to be paid for , cemetery fees , taxes , the obituary notice , prices for embalming , hair and cosmetics , a concrete grave liner , hearserental , music , a headstone . Lord , it was expensive to die . It was going to take most of the cash Mama had left , unless I wanted to put it on credit . But I was suspicious of debt . I 'd seen what happened to people who started down that plastic slide to disaster . Most of the time they were never able to climb out . This being Texas , there were no shelters or programs that would afford us a decent life . The only safety net was people 's kin . And I was too proud to consider tracking down unknown relatives , all strangers , so I could beg for money . I realized Mama 's funeral would have to be done on a shoestring , a thought that brought a pinching sensation in my throat and hot pressure behind my eyes . My mother had not been a churchgoer . I told Mr. Ferguson , and therefore we wanted a nonreligious ceremony . "You
49899	49915	49995	49995	ma'am	3204	" Miss Marva protested , shocked out of a weepy spell by the very idea . "
49924	49930	49931	49932	Mr. Ferguson	278	""You'd be surprised . Marva , "
49936	49975	49931	49932	Mr. Ferguson	278	" We have a few humanists in town . They just do n't care to admit it publicly , or they know they 'd find their doorsteps occupied with Bible - bangers carrying potted begonias and Bundt cakes . ""Have
49984	49993	49995	49995	ma'am	3204	" Miss Marva demanded , and he smiled . "No
50012	50210	50004	50005	some folks	1612	"After discussing some ideas for Mama 's humanist funeral , we went to the casket room.which had at least thirty of them set up in rows . I had n't realized there would be so many choices . Not only could you pick out the outside materials , you could choose linings of velvet or satin in just about any color . It unnerved me to learn you could also decide on the firmness of the mattress on the interior bed , as if it would make a difference to the deceased person 's comfort . Some of the more elegant coffins , like the one made of oak with a French Provincial hand - rubbed finish , or the steel in brushed bronze with the embroidered interior head panel , were four or five thousand dollars . And the casket in the farthest corner of the room was gaudier than anything I could have imagined , hand - painted like a Monet landscape with water , flowers , and a bridge , all yellows , blues , greens , and pinks . It had a tufted blue satin interior and pillow , and a matching throw . "Something
50219	50230	50004	50005	some folks	1612	" Mr. Ferguson asked , his smile a touch sheepish . "
50258	50319	50244	50244	I	0	"I wanted it for my mother . I did n't care that it was god - awful tacky and ostentatious and that once it was six feet under , no one would ever see it . If you were going to sleep someplace forever , it should be on blue satin pillows in a secret garden concealed beneath the ground . "
50325	50349	50244	50244	I	0	" I asked . Mr. Ferguson took a long time to answer , and when he did , his voice was very quiet . "
50358	51205	50355	50356	Miss Jones	280	"I could afford maybe a tenth of that . Poor people have few choices in life , and most of the time you do n't think much about it . You get the best you can , and do without when necessary , and hope to God you wo n't be wiped out by something you ca n't control . But there are moments it hurts , where there is something you want in the very marrow of your bones and you know there 's no way you can have it . I felt like that about Mama 's casket . And I realized this was an augury of things to come . A house , braces and clothes for Carrington , education , things that would help us climb across the deep trench between white trash and middle class ... these things would require more money than my ability to earn . I did n't know why I had never grasped the urgency of my situation before , even when Mama was alive . Why had I been so careless and unthinking ? I felt sick to my stomach . Stiffly I followed Mr. Ferguson to the side of the room featuring the econocaskets , and found a lacquered pine model lined with white taffeta for six hundred dollars . We went out back to a row of headstones and markers , and chose a bronze rectangular plate to lay over Mama 's grave . Someday , I vowed silently , I would replace it with a big marble headstone . As soon as news of the accident got out , ovens all over town were turned on . Even people we did n't know , or were only casually acquainted with , brought a casserole , pie . or cake to the trailer . Foil - wrapped parcels were piled on every available surface ; the counters , tables , the fridge and stove . Bereavement in Texas is a time to pull out your best recipes . Many people taped them to the plastic wrap or foil that covered their offerings , whichwasn't usually done , but I guess there was a general agreement that I needed all the help I could get . None of the recipes had more than four or five ingredients , and they were the kind of food you 'd often find at bake sales or potlucks . Tamale pie , ugly cake , King Ranch casserole , Coca - Cola brisket , Jell-0 salad . I was truly sorry so much food was given to us at a time when I could n't have felt less like eating . I pulled off the recipe cards and tucked them in a manila envelope for safekeeping , and took most of the food to the Cateses . For once I was grateful for Miss Judie 's reserve — I knew that no matter how sympathetic she was , she was n't going to discuss anything emotional . It was difficult to see Hardy 's family , when I wanted him so badly . I needed Hardy to come back and rescue me , and take care of me . I wanted him to hold me tight , and let me cry in his amis . But when I asked if Miss Judie had heard from him . she said not yet . he 'd be too busy to write or call for a while . The relief of tears came the second night after Mama had died , when I had crawled into bed next to Carrington 's robust little body . She snuggled against me in her sleep , and let out a baby sigh , and that sound cracked the seal around my heart . At two , Carrington had no understanding of death . The finality of it escaped her . She kept asking when Mama was coming back , and when I had tried to explain about heaven , she had listened without comprehension and interrupted me by asking for a Popsicle . I lay there holding her . worrying about what would happen to us . if some social worker would show up to take her away , or what I would do if Carrington became seriously ill and how to prepare her for life when I knew so damn little . I had never paid a bill before . I did n't know where either of our Social Security cards were . And I worried if Carrington would remember Mama at all . Realizing there was no one for me to share my memories of my mother with , I felt tears begin to leak out of my eyes in a continuous stream . That went on for a while until I began to cry so hard that I finally went to the bathroom and filled the tub and sat upright like a child , crying into my bathwater until a great dull calmness had settled over me . Do you need money ? "
51235	51258	51212	51212	she	234	" My family can loan you some . And Daddy says there 's a part - time job available at the shop . "I

51724	51743	51751	51751	Luce	282	" I pulled on a black sleeveless acrylic top and tucked it into the top of my skirt . "

51798	51830	51791	51791	She	1632	" Girlfriend , if you 're waiting for a fairy godmother to show up with a dress and a ride , you 're not going to make it to the party . "I

52031	52037	52038	52039	Mr. Ferguson	278	"They're nearly giving them away , "
52043	52073	52038	52039	Mr. Ferguson	278	" In fact , the Monet isnow the exact same price as the pine coffin you purchased . I can switch them out for you at no extra expense . "I
52082	52085	52038	52039	Mr. Ferguson	278	" Are you sure?""Yes
52089	52132	52038	52039	Mr. Ferguson	278	"Suspecting that Mr. Ferguson 's generosity might have had something to do with the fact that he had taken Miss Marva out to dinner a couple of nights before . I went to ask her exactly what had happened on their date . "Liberty
52135	52141	52143	52143	you	280	" she had said indignantly , "
52155	52510	52143	52143	you	280	coffin?"Abashed , I replied that I 'd meant no disrespect , and of course I did n't think such a thing . Still indignant . Miss Marva had informed me that if she had slept with Arthur Ferguson . there was no doubt he would have given me the dadgum coffin for free . The graveside service was beautiful , if a little scandalous by Welcome standards . Mr. Ferguson conducted the sendee , talking a little about Mama and her life , and how much she would be missed by her friends and two daughters . There was no mention at all of Louis . His kin had taken his body off to Mesquite . where he 'd been born and many of the Sadleks still lived . They 'd hired a manager for Bluebonnet Ranch , a shiftless young man named Mike Mendeke . One of Mama 's closest friends at work , a plump woman with tea - colored hair , read a poem : Do not stand at my grave and weepI am not there , I do not sleep . I am a thousand winds that blow , I am the diamond glints on snow , I am the sun on ripened grain , I am the gentle autumn rain . When you awaken in the morning 's hushI am the swift uplifting rushOf quiet birds in circled flight . I am the soft stars that shine at night . Do not stand at my grave and cry , I am not there ; I did not die . It may not have been a religious poem , but by the time Deb had finished , there were tears in many eyes . I laid two yellow roses , one from Carrington and one from me . on top of the coffin . Red may be the preferred color of roses everywhere else , but in Texas it 's yellow . Mr. Ferguson had promised me the flowers would be buried with Mama when it was lowered into the ground . At the end of the service , we played "
52512	53261	53563	53563	her	1638	" by John Lennon , which elicited smiles from a few faces , and disapproving frowns from many more . Forty - two white balloons — one for each year of Mama 's age — were released in the warm blue sky . It was the perfect funeral for Diana Truitt Jones . I think my mother would have loved it . When the service was over , I felt a sudden fierce need to rush back to Carrington . I wanted to hug her for a long time , and stroke the pale blond curls that reminded me so much of Mama 's . Carrington had never seemed so fragile to me , so vulnerable to every kind of harm . As I turned to glance at the row of cars , I saw a black limo with tinted windows parked in the distance . Welcome is not what you 'd call limo country , so this was a mildly startling sight . The design of the vehicle was modern , its doors and windows sealed , its shape as streamlined and perfect as a shark's . No other funeral was being held that day . Whoever was sitting in that limo had known my mother , had wanted to watch her service from a distance . I stood very still , staring at the vehicle . My feet moved , and I suppose I was going over to ask if he — or she — wanted to come to the graveside . But just as I started toward it . the limo pulled away in a slow glide . It ’s me . The thought that I would never find out who it was . Soon after the funeral Carrington and I were visited by a guardian ad litem . or GAL , who had been appointed to assess whether I was fit to be her legal guardian . The GAL 's fee was one hundred and fifty dollars , which I thought was pretty steep considering she stayed less than an hour . Thank God the court had waived the fee — I did n't think my checking account would cover it . Carrington seemed to know it was important for her to behave well . Under the GAL 's observation , she built a block tower , dressed her favorite doll , and sang the ABC song from start to finish . While the GAL asked me questions about the baby 's upbringing and my plans for the future , Carrington climbed into my lap and pressed a few impassioned kisses on my cheek . After each kiss , she glanced significantly at the GAL to make certain her actions were being duly noted . The next phase of the process was surprisingly easy . I went to Family Court and gave the judge letters from Miss Marva . the pediatrician , and the pastor of the Lamb of God , all offering good opinions as to my character and my parenting abilities . The judge expressed concern over my lack of a job , advised me to get something right away , and warned me to expect the occasional visit from Social Services . When the hearing was over , the court clerk told me to write out a check for seventy - five dollars , which I did with a purple glitter pen I found at the bottom of my purse . They gave me a folder with copies of the petition and information release forms I 'd filled out , and the certificate of guardianship . I could n't help feeling like I 'd just bought Carrington and been handed the receipt . I went outside the courthouse and found Lucy waiting for me at the bottom of the steps , with Carrington in her stroller . For the first time in days , I laughed as I saw Carrington 's chubby hands clutching a cardboard sign Lucy had made for her : PROPERTY OF LIBERTY JONES .

The idea of it is an affront to nature . People are meant to stay on the ground . I put down the classifieds and glanced at Carrington , who was sitting in her high chair and feeding long strands of spaghetti into her mouth . Most of her hair was fastened into a sprig of hair at the top of her head and clipped with a big red bow . She was dressed in herdiapers and nothing else . We had discovered that cleanup after dinner was a lot easier if she ate topless . Carrington regarded me solemnly , with a big orange smear of spaghetti sauce across her mouth and chin . "How
53414	53437	53438	53438	Okeydokey	289	" I asked her . Her small round face split into a grin , displaying a set of widely spaced white teeth . "

The next couple of days were taken up with going on errands , and filling out the application for Happy Helpers and going for the interview . I did n't get a chance until later in the week to call the florist . The girl who answered the phone said , "
54973	54989	54990	54990	I	0	" and before I could say anything , I found myself listening to Hank Williams crooning "
55000	55051	55053	55053	you	1697	"I sat on the lid of the closed toilet seat , the phone loosely cupped to my ear . and watched Carrington play in her bathwater . She concentrated on pouring water from one plastic Dixie cup to another , and then adding liquid soap and stirring with her finger . "What

55261	55335	55228	55229	the girl	488	" there was another ring in the background , and the girl hung up . I went through a list in my mind of every possible person who would have arranged such a thing . No one I knew had the money .

She was perfect in every way , I thought . It was our game to make a tent out of the towel after Carrington was dry . I pulled it over our heads and we giggled together beneath the damp terry cloth , kissing each other 's noses . The phone ringing interrupted our play , and I quickly wrapped Carrington in the towel . I pressed the receiver button . "

We went through a whole bottle of over - the - counter medicine , but it seemed to have little effect . One night I woke up from what sounded like dog barks , and I realized Carrington 's throat had swollen until she could only breathe in shallow pants . In a terror worse than anything I had ever known . I drove her to the hospital , where they admitted us without insurance . My sister was diagnosed with croup , and they brought out a plastic mask attached to a nebulizer machine that pumped out medicine in a gray - white mist . Frightened by the noise the machine made , not to mention the mask , Carrington shrank into my lap and cried pitifully . No matter how I reassured her that it would n't hurt , it would make her better , she refused until her body spasmed with coughing . "Can

60673	60687	60669	60670	an orphan	1897	I—"Before I could explain about Carrington , Angie had interrupted with a gushing , "
60702	61270	61271	61271	She	1899	"Technically I had n't lied . But withholdine information is often the same as a lie . andmost people would say Carrington was definitely baggage . In my opinion , they would have been dead wrong . Carrington was n't baggage , and she did n't deserve to be lumped in with incurable diseases and felonies . Besides , if I was n't going to hold it against Mike that he 'd had a divorce , he should n't hold it against me that I was raising my little sister . The first part of the date went well . Mike was a handsome man with a full head of blond hair and a nice smile . We ate at a Japanese restaurant with a name I could n't pronounce . To my surprise , the waitress led us to a table no higher than my kneecaps , and we sat on cushions on the floor . Unfortunately I had worn my least favorite pants because my best black ones were at the cleaners . The pair I 'd had to settle for , also black , were too short in the stride , with the result that sitting on the floor gave me a wedgie for the entire meal . And even though the sushi was beautifully made , if I closed my eyes I would have sworn I was eating out of a bait bucket . Still , it was nice to be out on a Saturday night at an elegant restaurant instead of the kind where they handed out crayons along with the menus . For all that Mike was in his mid - twenties , there was something unformed about him . Not physically ... he was nice - looking and appeared to be in good shape . But I knew five minutes after meeting him that he was still trapped in the end of his marriage , even though the divorce was final . It had been a bad divorce , he told me , but he 'd put one over on his ex because she had thought winning the dog was a major concession , when Mike had secretly never liked it . He went on to tell me how they had split up their belongings , even breaking up pairs of lamps to achieve strict equality . After dinner I asked Mike if he wanted to go back to my apartment and watch a movie , and he said yes . I was overwhelmed with relief when we reached the apartment . Since this was the first time I had ever left Carrington alone with a sitter in Houston , I 'd worried about her all during dinner . The babysitter , Brittany , was a twelve - year - old whose family lived in the apartment building . She had been recommended by the woman in the front office . Brittany had assured me that she babysat for lots of children in the building , and if there were any problems , her mother was only two floors down . I paid Brittany , asked how things had gone , and she said she and Carrington had gotten along great . They had made popcorn and watched a Disney movie , and Carrington had had a bath . The only problem had been getting Carrington to stay in bed . "
61276	61284	61285	61285	She	1899	" Brittany said with a helpless shrug . "

61336	61381	61382	61382	Liberty	196	" Pocketing the fifteen dollars I had given her . Brittany went out . giving a little wave over her shoulder . At the same time , the bedroom door burst open , and Carrington came flying into the main room in her pajamas . "

61431	61519	61427	61431	that yellow - haired man?"I	3784	man?"I glanced quickly at Mike . Although he had forced a smile , it was obviously not the time for introductions . His gaze traveled slowly around the room , adhering briefly to the worn - out sofa , the places on the coffee table where the wood - grain veneer had chipped . It surprised me that I felt a sting of defensiveness . that it felt so uncomfortable to see myself from his perspective . I hunched over my little sister and kissed her hair . "
61551	61559	61560	61560	she	1901	""I want you to come with me , "
61563	61578	61560	61560	she	1901	"No , it 's not my bedtime , it 's yours . Go on . ""But

61754	61781	61729	61729	I	0	" All right . Stay in bed and — I mean this , Carrington — I do n't want to hear a peep out of you . "She

61845	61997	61731	61731	her	254	" She subsided behind the book until all that was visible of her was a pair of small hands clamped on either side of the cover . I went back into the living room , where Mike was sitting stiffly on the sofa . At some point in the process of dating someone , whether you 've gone out one time or a hundred times , a moment occurs when you know exactly how much significance that person will have in your life . You know this person will be an important part of your future , or you know he 's only someone to pass the time with . Or you would n't care if you never saw him again . I regretted having invited Mike into the apartment . I wished he was gone so I could have a bath and get in bed . I smiled at him . "Find

Was the penny going to lodge somewhere in Carrington 's esophagus and require an operation for its removal ? How much would that kind of operation cost?The woman at the other end of the phone was annoyingly calm as I described the emergency . She took down the information and said the pediatrician would call back within ten minutes . Hanging up the phone . I continued to hold Carrington in my lap . her bare feet dangling . Mike approached us both . I saw from his expression that this would be forever engraved in his mind as the date from hell . He wanted to leave almost as badly as I wanted him to go . "Look
62700	62705	62708	62710	a gorgeous girl	1919	" he said awkwardly , "
62775	62918	62769	62769	You	1918	"I understood . Mike wanted a girl with no problems and no past experiences , someone who came with a guarantee that she would never make mistakes or disappoint or hurt him . Later I would feel sorry for him . I knew there was a lot of disappointment in store for Mike , in his search for the woman with no baggage . But for the moment I felt only annoyance at him . I thought of how Hardy had always come to the rescue at times like this . the way he would stride into a room and take charge , and the incredible relief I felt at knowing he was there . But Hardy was n't coming . All I had was a useless male who did n't even think to ask if he could do something to help . "That

The ice jiggled dangerously in the glass . I wondered in desperation if a few drops had spilled . Assuming an implacable smile , I entered the VIP room . Mr. Travis was seated in the chair , facing a huge gold - framed mirror . Zenko was describing possible variations on Mr. Travis 's current hairstyle , which was the standard businessman 's cut . I gathered Zenko was gently hinting that Mr. Travis should try something a little different , maybe allow him to texture and gel it at the top to update his look to something edgier .

The word "
68805	69062	69063	69063	I	0	" set me off . I felt a laugh break from my lips , and then another , and then there was no stopping the helpless giggles that made my eyes water and my shoulders tremble . I clamped a hand over my mouth to hold them back , but that only made it worse . I began to seriously worry if I could stop . I was making a spectacle of myself in the fanciest restaurant I 'd ever been in . The waiter tactfully disappeared . I tried to gasp out an apology to Churchill , who watched me with concern and shook his head slightly , as if to say No , don ' t apologize . He put his hand on my wrist in a reassuring grip . Somehow the pressure on my wrist quieted the wild laughter . I was able to take a long breath , and my chest relaxed . I told him about moving to the trailer in Welcome , and Mama 's boyfriend named Flip who had shot the emu . I could n't seem to talk fast enough , so many details tumbled out . Churchill caught every word , his eyes crinkling at the corners , and when I finally reached the part about giving the dead emu to the Cateses , he was chuckling . Although I had n't been aware of ordering wine , the waiter brought a bottle of pinot noir . The liquid glittered richly in tall - stemmed crystal glasses . "

Churchill reached inside his jacket , extracted a cell phone no larger than a domino , and dialed Salon One . As I watched , openmouthed , he asked for Zenko , informed him that I would be taking the afternoon off , and asked if that would be all right . According to Churchill , Zenko said of course it would be all right and he would rearrange the schedule . No problem . As Churchill closed the cell phone with a self - satisfied click , I said darkly , "

I talked through the entire lunch , prodded by Churchill 's questions , his warm interest , the wineglass that somehow never emptied no matter how much I drank . The freedom of saying anything to him , telling all , relieved a burden I had n't even realized I 'd been carrying . In my relentless push to keep moving forward , there had been so many emotions I had n't let myself inhabit fully , so many things I had n't talked about . Now I could n't quite catch up to myself . I fumbled in my purse for my wallet and got out Carrington 's school picture . She had a gap - toothed smile , and one of her ponytails was a little higher than the other . Churchill looked at the photo for a long time , even reached in his pocket for a pair of reading glasses so he could see every detail . He drank some wine before commenting . "

This was what it would have been like , I thought with a small , painful thrill . This was a glimpse of what I might have had with Daddy . A man so much older and wiser , who seemed to understand everything , even the things I had n't said . It had bothered me for years that Carrington did n't have a father . What I had n't realized was how much I still needed one for myself . Still buzzed from the wine . I told Churchill about Carrington 's upcoming Thanksgiving pageant at school . Her class , which would perform two songs , was divided into Pilgrims and Native Americans , and Carrington had balked at being part of either group . She wanted to be a cowgirl . She 'd been so stubborn about it that her teacher , Miss Hansen , had called me at home . I 'd explained to Carrington that there had been no cowgirls in 1621 . There had n't even been a Texas then , I told her . It turned out my sister did n't care about historical accuracy . The argument had finally been resolved by Miss Hansen 's suggestion that Carrington be allowed to wear the cowgirl costume and walk out on stage at the very beginning of the pageant . She would carry a cardboard sign shaped like our state , printed with the words A TEXAS THANKSGIVING.Churchill roared with laughter at the story , seeming to think my sister 's muleheadedness was a virtue .

Most of my work was as a colorist — I had a talent for highlights and corrections . I loved mixing liquids and pastes in a multitude of small bowls like a mad scientist . I enjoyed the myriad small but critical calculations of heat , timing , and application , and the satisfaction of getting everything just right . Churchill still went to Zenko for his cuts , but I did his neck and eyebrow trims , and I did his manicures whenever he wanted them . And there were the infrequent lunches when one of us had something to celebrate . When we were together , we talked about anything and everything . I knew a lot about Churchill 's family , particularly his four children . There was Gage , the oldest at thirty , whom he 'd had by his first wife , Joanna . The other three he 'd had with Ava : Jack , who was twenty - five , Joe , who was two years younger , and the only daughter , Haven , who was still in college . I knew Gage had become reserved since he hadlost his mother at the age of three , and that he had a hard time trusting people , and one of his past girlfriends had said he had commitment phobia . Being unacquainted with psychospeak . Churchill did n't know what that meant . "It

I had confided in him about Hardy and how he haunted me . Hardy was every loose - limbed cowboy in worn denim , every pair of blue eyes , every battered pickup , every hot cloudless day . Maybe , Churchill had pointed out , I should stop trying so hard not to love Hardy , and accept that some part of me might always want him . "

I realized what was bothering me had nothing to do with blow jobs . The problem was , our emotional intimacy , like our sex life , had its limits . Tom had no interest in the secret places of my heart , nor I in his . We were more adventurous in our selection of gourmet foods than we were in the hazardous territory of a true relationship . It was beginning to dawn on me how rare it was for two people to find the kind of connection Hardy and I had shared . And Hardy had given it up , given me up , for the wrong reasons . I hoped to hell he was n't finding it any easier than I was to build a relationship with someone . "What

73375	74312	73335	73335	he	311	"I took the slip of paper from him . My Honda needed a run through the car wash , but I did n't spare the time . I needed to see Churchill as soon as possible . It took only fifteen minutes to get there from Zenko 's . In Houston you measure distance by minutes instead of miles , since traffic can turn a short commute into a stop - and - start journey through hell , where road rage is just a driving technique . I've heard people compare River Oaks to Highland Park in Dallas , but it 's bigger and even more expensive . You could call it the Beverly Hills of Texas . River Oaks consists of about a thousand acres located halfway between Downtown and Uptown , with two schools , a country club , upscale restaurants and shops , and esplanades of brilliant flowers . When River Oaks was established in the 1920s , there was what they called a gentleman 's agreement to keep out blacks and browns , except for those living in the maids ' quarters . Now those so - called gentlemen are gone , and there 's more diversity in River Oaks . It 's no longer all - white , but it is definitely all - rich , with the cheapest homes starting at a million dollars and going up from there . I guided my battered Honda along streets of two - story mansions , past Mercedes and BMWs . Some of the homes were designed in the Spanish Revival style , with flagstone terraces , turrets , and ornamental wrought - iron balcony railings . Others had been modeled after New Orleans plantation homes , or New England colonials with white columns , gables , and banded chimneys . They were all large , beautifully landscaped , and shaded by oaks that lined the walks like giant sentinels . Although I knew Churchill 's house was going to be impressive , there was no way I could have been adequately prepared for it . It was an estate , a stone house designed like a European chateau and set back on a three - acre bayou lot . I stopped at the heavy iron gates and entered the code . To my relief , the gates opened with majestic slowness . A broad paved drive led to the house and split into two roads , one encircling the house , the other leading toa separate garage big enough for ten cars . I pulled up to the garage and parked at the side , trying to find the least conspicuous place . My poor Honda looked like something that had been left out for the garbagemen to collect . The garage doors were made entirely of glass , showcasing a silver Mercedes sedan . the white Bentley , and a yellow Shelby Cobra with Lemans stripes . There were more cars on the other side , but I was too dazed and anxious to look at them . It was a relatively cool autumn day , and I was grateful for the diffident breeze that cooled my perspiring forehead . Carrying a bag filled with supplies , I walked to the front door . The plants and hedged sections of lawn around the house looked like they 'd been watered with Evian and trimmed with cuticle scissors . I could have sworn the long , silky drifts of Mexican feather grass bordering the front walk had been tended with a Mason Pearson pocket comb . I reached for the doorbell button , which was located beneath an inset video camera just like the ones you see at ATM machines . As I rang the bell , it caused the video camera to whir and focus on me , and I nearly recoiled . I realized I had n't brushed my hair or touched up my makeup before leaving the salon . Now it was too late , as I found myself standing in front of a rich people 's doorbell that was looking right back at me . In less than a minute the door opened . I was greeted by a slim elderly woman , elegantly dressed in green pants and beaded mules and a patterned chiffon blouse . She looked about sixty , but she was so well kept I guessed her real age was probably closer to seventy . Her silver hair had been cut and teased into the Drain Clog style , not a hole to be found in the perfect puffy mass . We were nearly of a height , but the hair gave her at least three inches on me . Diamond earrings the size of Christmas ornaments dangled halfway to her shoulders . She smiled , a genuine smile that made her eyes crinkle into familiar dark slits . Instantly I knew she was Churchill 's older sister Gretchen . who had been engaged three times but never married . Churchill had told me all Gretchen 's fiances had died in tragic circumstances . the first in the Korean War , the second in a car accident , the third from a heart defect no one had known about until it killed him without warning . After the last one Gretchen had said it was obvious she was not meant to marry , and she 'd stayed single ever since . I had been so moved by the story I 'd almost cried , picturing Churchill 's sister as a spinster dressed in black . "
74320	74326	74315	74315	she	2169	" I had asked tentatively , "
74331	74350	74351	74355	A man in her life?""Hell	3967	" I paused as I considered the best way to phrase it . Carnal relations ? Physical intimacy ? "
74355	74366	74367	74367	Churchill	317	life?""Hell , no , she does n't find it lonely , "
74374	74407	74367	74367	Churchill	317	" Gretchen kicks up her heels every time she gets a chance . She 's had more than her fair share of men — she just wo n't marry any of 'em . "Staring
74435	74442	74443	74443	She	2170	"Liberty . I 'm Gretchen Travis . "
74490	74542	74545	74545	she	2170	" Churchill told me about you , but he did n't say what a pretty little thing you are . Are you thirsty , honey ? Is that bag heavy ? Leave it there and we 'll have someone carry it up for us . Do you know who you remind me of?"Like
74557	74575	74576	74576	I	0	" Thank you , ma'am , but I 'm not thirsty . And I can carry this . "

74689	74711	74680	74680	she	2170	" Just like she looked in Gilda , with that wavy hair and those long eyelashes . Did you ever see that movie?""No

74739	74767	74729	74729	She	2170	" We could take the stairs . But this is so much easier . Never stand when you can sit and never walk when you can ride . ""Yes
74771	74841	74729	74729	She	2170	" I straightened my clothing as discreetly as possible , tugging the hem ofmy black vee - neck T - shirt over the top of my white jeans . My red - polished toes peeked out from a pair of backless low - heeled sandals . I wished I had chosen a nicer outfit that morning , but I 'd had no idea how the day would turn out . "

75047	75066	75044	75044	She	2170	" He 'd never make it through airport security . Good thing he 's got his own plane . "I

75834	75939	75940	75942	One or two	2199	" I said immediately , and went into the bathroom . The enormous space was lined with terra - cotta tiles and copper - flecked marble , with a half - sunken oval bathtub in the center . The walk - in shower and window were made entirely of glass blocks . It was lucky the bathroom was so big , I thought , in light of Churchill being wheelchair - bound . I found a cluster of brown medicine bottles on one counter , along with an ordinary plastic Dixie cup dispenser that looked out of place in the magazine - perfect surroundings . "

I could n't imagine how much his leg must be hurting , his bones protesting the new arrangement of metal rods and screws . His system must have been overwhelmed with the prospect of healing so much damage . I asked if he wanted to rest , I could wait for him , or come back some other time . Churchill replied emphatically he 'd had enough resting . He wanted some good company , which had been in short supply lately . This with a meaningful glance at Gretchen , who replied serenely that if a person wanted to attract good company , he had to be good company . After a minute of affectionate squabbling . Gretchen took her leave , reminding Churchill to buzz the intercom button if he needed anything . I pushed his wheelchair into the bathroom and positioned him next to the sink . "No

Suddenly I was annoyed with Churchill for putting me in this situation , among people who were going to make fun of me the minute I left the room . I tried to keep my mouth shut , but as another mesh of silence settled . I could n't stop myself from breaking through it . I looked at Gage Travis again . "
80286	80321	80278	80278	You	2324	" I tried to remember what Churchill had said , that although Gage had a hand in the family investment business , he had also started his own company that developed alternative energy technologies . "It

After drinks we had dinner in an oval - shaped dining room with a two - story ceiling and a chandelier with crystals hanging down like strands of raindrops . The arched doorway on one side of the dining room led to the kitchen , while the one on the other side featured a wrought - iron gate . Churchill told me there was a dine - in wine cellar beyond the gate , with a collection of about ten thousand bottles . Heavy chairs upholstered in olive velvet were pulled up to a mahogany table . The housekeeper and a young Hispanic woman poured inky red wine into large - bowled glasses and brought a flute filled with Seven - Up for Carrington . My sister sat at Churchill 's left , and I took her other side . I reminded her in a whisper to put her napkin on her lap and not to set her glass so close to the edge of the table . She behaved beautifully , remembering her pleases and thank - yous . There was only one worrisome moment when the plates were brought out and I was unable to identify their contents . My sister , although not a picky eater , did not have what anyone would call an adventurous palate . "What
80934	80953	80686	80686	Dawnelle	351	" Carrington whispered , staring dubiously at the collection of strips and balls and chunks on her plate . "It

81015	81028	80686	80686	Dawnelle	351	" he asked . Carrington pointed to her plate with her fork . "
81045	81093	81122	81122	they	2332	"Churchill , Gretchen , and Jack laughed , while Gage regarded us without expression . Dawnelle was in the process of explaining to the housekeeper that she wanted her food taken back to the kitchen and weighed carefully . Three ounces of meat was all she wanted . "That

I had another private conversation that evening , with Churchill . Jack had long since departed , and mercifully so had Gage , to take his size - zero girlfriend home . Gretchen showed Carrington her collection of antique cast - iron banks , one shaped like Humpty - Dumpty . another like a cow whose back legs kicked a fanner when you dropped a coin in . While they played on the other side of the room , I sat on an ottoman besideChurchill 's wheelchair . "You
82569	82576	82577	82577	Churchill	317	" he asked . I nodded . "

Together we looked across the room at Carrington . who chortled in delight as a little cast - iron monkey flipped a penny into a box with its tail . That weekend we went for Sunday dinner at Miss Marva 's . The ranch house was filled with the smell of beer pot roast and mashed potatoes . You would have thought Miss Marva and Mr. Ferguson had been married for fifty years , they were so comfortable with each other . While Miss Marva took Carrington back into her sewing room , I sat in the den with Mr. Ferguson and laid out my dilemma . He listened in silence , his expression mild , his hands templed on his midriff . "I
82787	82792	82794	82794	you	2383	" I told him . "

I do n't think it 's going to hurt you or Carrington to spend a little time in a place you do n't belong . It may benefit you in ways you do n't expect . ""Or

83315	83782	83810	83810	Churchill	317	" CHAPTER 17 Every time Gage Travis looked at me , you could tell he wanted to tear me limb from limb . Not in a fury , but in a process of slow and methodical dismemberment . Jack and Joe dropped by about once a week , but Gage was the one who came to the house on a daily basis . He helped Churchill with things like climbing in and out of the shower and getting dressed , and taking him to doctor 's appointments . No matter how much I disliked Gage , I had to admit he was a good son . He could have insisted that Churchill hire a nurse , but instead he showed up to take care of his father himself . Eight o'clock every morning , never one minute early or late . He was good for Churchill , who was cantankerous from the combination of boredom , pain , and constant inconvenience . But no matter how Churchill growled or snapped , I never once saw one sign of impatience from Gage . He was always calm , tolerant , and capable . Until he was around me , and then he was a first - class jerk . Gage made it clear that in his opinion I was a parasite , a gold digger , and worse . He took no notice of Carrington other than to demonstrate a curt awareness that there was a short person in the house . The day we moved in , our possessions crammed into cardboard boxes , I thought Gage would throw me out bodily . I had begun to unpack in the bedroom I had chosen , a beautiful space with wide windows and pale moss - green walls , and cream - colored molding . What had decided me on the room was the grouping of black - and - white photographs on one wall . They were Texas images : a cactus , a barbed - wire fence , a horse , and to my delight , a front shot of an armadillo looking straight into the camera . I 'd taken that as an auspicious sign . Carrington was going to sleep two doors down , in a small but pretty room with yellow and white striped paper on the walls . As I opened my suitcase on the king - sized bed , Gage appeared in the doorway . My fingers curled around the edge of the suitcase , my knuckles jutting until you could have shredded carrots on them . Even knowing I was reasonably safe — surely Churchill would keep him from killing me — I was still alarmed . He filled up the doorway , looking big and mean and pitiless . "What
83790	83809	83810	83810	Churchill	317	" His soft voice unsettled me far more than shouting would have . I answered through dry lips . "
83820	83844	83810	83810	Churchill	317	""You can either leave voluntarily , or I 'll throw you out . Believe me . you 'd rather go on your own . "I
83849	83866	83810	83810	Churchill	317	" You have a problem , you talk to your father . He wants me here . ""I
83876	83920	83922	83922	your	2402	"A little trickle of sweat went down the middle of my back . I did n't move . He reached me in three strides and took my upper arm in a painful grip . A gasp of surprise was torn from my throat . "
83927	83949	83922	83922	your	2402	" I strained and shoved at him . but his chest was as unyielding as the trunk of a live oak . "I
83959	84060	83953	83953	I	0	" He broke off . I was released with a suddenness that caused me to stagger back a step . Our sharp respirations pierced the silence . He was staring at the dresser , where I had set out a few pictures in stand - up frames . Trembling . I put my hand on the part of my arm he 'd gripped . I rubbed the spot as if to erase his touch . But I could still feel an invisible handprint embedded in my skin . He went to the dresser and picked up one of the photos . "
84063	84090	83922	83922	your	2402	this?"It was a picture of Mama , taken not long after she 'd married my father . She had been impossibly young and blond and beautiful . "
84096	84109	83922	83922	your	2402	" I cried , rushing forward to snatch the photo from him . "Who
84113	84117	84118	84118	mother	1621	" he repeated . "My
84120	84318	84118	84118	mother	1621	"His head bent as he stood over me , looking into my face with a speculative gaze . I was so bewildered by the abrupt halt of our conflict that I could n't summon the words to ask what in God 's name was going through his mind . I was absurdly conscious of the sound of my breathing , and his , the counterpoint gradually evening until the rhythm of our lungs was identical . Light from the plantation shutters made bright stripes across both of us , casting shadow spokes from his lashes down the crests of his cheek . I could see the whisker grain of his close - shaven skin , foretelling a heavy five o'clock shadow . I dampened my dry lips with my tongue , and his gaze followed the movement . We were standing too close . I could smell the bite of starch in his collar , and a whiff of warm male skin , and I was shocked by my response . In spite of everything . I wanted to lean even closer . I wanted a deep breath of him . A frown tugged between his brows . "
84324	84500	83922	83922	your	2402	" he muttered , and left the room without another word . I had no doubt he 'd gone straight to Churchill , but it would be a long time before I found out what was said between them , or why Gage had decided to abandon that particular battle . All I knew was there was no more interference from Gage as we settled in . He left before supper , while Churchill , Gretchen , Carrington , and I celebrated our first night together . We ate fish steamed in little white paper bags and rice mixed with finely chopped peppers and vegetables that made it look like confetti . When Gretchen asked if our rooms were all right and did we have everything we needed . Carrington and I both replied enthusiastically . Carrington said her canopy bed made her feel like a princess . I said I loved my room too , the soft green walls were so soothing , and I especially liked the black - and - white photographs . "You'll
84506	84512	84513	84513	He	331	" Gretchen said , beaming . "
84544	84552	84526	84526	He	331	"A horrifying suspicion darted through my mind . "
84555	84563	84526	84526	He	331	" I said , and swallowed hard . "
84576	84584	84585	84585	Gage	331	" I could barely speak his name . "

84730	84862	84721	84721	someone	3150	"Like hell . I thought , and reached for my wineglass . Later that evening I emptied my cosmetics bags beside the bathroom sink . As I pulled out the top drawer , I heard something rattling and rolling around . Investigating , I found a few personal items that looked as though they 'd been there a while . A used toothbrush , a pocket comb , an ancient tube of hair gel .. .and a box of condoms . I turned and closed the bathroom door before examining the box more closely . There were three foil packets left out of twelve . It was a brand I had never seen before , British - made . And there was a funny phrase on the side of the box , "
84872	84920	84721	84721	someone	3150	" Kite - marked ? What the heck did that mean ? It sort of looked like a European version of the Good Housekeeping seal of approval . I could n't help noticing the little yellow sunburst at the corner of the box , printed with the words "
84924	85643	84721	84721	someone	3150	" This was appropriate , I reflected sourly , in light of the fact that I already thought of Gage Travis as a big prick . I wondered what I was supposed to do with this stuff . There was no way I was going to return Gage 's long - forgotten condoms to him . But I could n't throw his things away , on the off chance that he might remember someday and ask what I 'd done with them . So I pushed them far back in the drawer and put my own things in there . I tried not to think about the fact that Gage Travis and I were sharing a drawer . For the first few weeks I was busier than I had ever been in my life , and happier than I 'd been since before Mama had died . Carrington made new friends quickly , and she was doing well at the new school , which had a nature center , a computer lab , a well - stocked library , and all kinds of enrichment classes . I had braced myself for adjustment problems that so far Carrington did n't seem to be having . Maybe her age made it easier to adapt to the strange new world she found herself living in . People were usually nice to me . according me the distant friendliness reserved foremployees . My status as Churchill 's personal assistant ensured I was treated well . I could tell when a former Salon One client recognized me but could n't figure out where we 'd met . The circles the Travises occupied were filled with high - living people , some pedigreed and wealthy , some merely wealthy . But whether they 'd earned or inherited their place at the top . they were determined to enjoy it . Houston high society is blond , tan , and well dressed . It 's also toned and slim , despite the city 's annual place on the Top Ten Fattest list . The rich people are in great shape . It 's the rest of us , the lovers of burritos and Dr Pepper and chicken - fried steak , who inflate the average . If you ca n't afford a gym membership in Houston , you 're going to be fat . You ca n't jog outside with so many days of triple - degree heat and lethal levels of hydrocarbons in the air . And even if it were n't for the poor air quality , public places like Memorial Park can be crowded and dangerous . Since Houstonians are n't too proud to take the easy way out , plastic surgery is more popular here than anywhere except California . It seems like everyone has had some kind of work done . If you ca n't afford it stateside , you can slip across the border and get implants or lipo at a bargain . And if you put it on your credit card , you can earn enough mileage points to pay for Southwest tickets . Once I accompanied Gretchen to a Botox or Bangs luncheon , where she and her friends chatted and ate and took turns getting injected . Gretchen asked me to drive her , since she tended to get headaches after Botox . It was an all - white meal , and by that I do n't mean the color of the guests but the food itself . It started with white soup — cauliflower andGruyere — a crunchy salad of white jicama and white asparagus with basil dressing , an entree of white chicken and pears poached in a delicious clear broth , and a dessert of white chocolate coconut trifle . I was more than happy to eat in the kitchen and watch the caterers . The three of them worked together with the precision of the parts in a watch . It was almost like a dance , the way they moved and turned and never once bumped into each other . When it was time to leave , each guest received a silk Hermes scarf as a party favor . Gretchen gave me hers as soon as we got into the car . "
85656	85660	85661	85661	I	0	""Oh . no . "
85686	85698	85679	85679	Hermes	357	" You do n't have to give me that , Gretchen . ""Take
85701	85705	85679	85679	Hermes	357	" she insisted . "
85716	85853	85679	85679	Hermes	357	"It was hard for me to accept the gift gracefully . Not because I was n't appreciative , but because after years of penny - pinching I was bewildered by so much extravagance . I bought a set of two - way radios for me and Churchill , and I wore one clipped to my belt at all times . He must have called me every fifteen minutes the first couple of days . Not only was he delighted with the convenience of it , but it was a relief to him not to feel so isolated in his room . Carrington pestered me constantly to borrow the walkie - talkie . Whenever I relented and let her have it for ten minutes , she wandered through the house conversing with Churchill , the hallways echoing with "
85855	85857	85679	85679	Hermes	357	" and "
85859	85861	85679	85679	Hermes	357	" and "
85869	86494	85679	85679	Hermes	357	" Before long they had made a deal that Carrington would be Churchill 's go - to girl during the hour before dinner , and she would have her own walkie - talkie . If he did n't come up with enough tasks for her , she would complain until he was forced to invent things to keep her busy . Once I caught him tossing the remote control to the floor , so Carrington could be contacted for a rescue . Early on I did a lot of shopping for Churchill , trying to find solutions for problems caused by the hard cast . He resented the indignity of being forced to wear sweatpants all the time , but there was no way he could wear regular pants over the bulk of the cast . I found a compromise he could live with , a few pairs of zip - off hiking pants that allowed him to take one leg off to expose the cast , and leave the other long . They were still more casual than he would have preferred , but he admitted they were better than the sweatpants . I bought yards of cotton tubing to cover Churchill 's cast every night , to keep the fiberglass from wearing holes in the eight - hundred - thread - count sheets on his bed . And my best find was at a hardware store , a long aluminum tool with a handle on one end and a pair of jaws on the other , allowing him to grip and pick up things he could n't otherwise reach . We fell quickly into a routine . Gage would visit early each morning and return to 1800 Main , where he worked and lived . The Travises owned the entire building , which was located near the Bank of America Center and the blue glass towers that had once been Enron Centers North and South . It had once been the most nondescript building in Houston , a plain gray box . But Churchill had gotten it at a steal , and had redesigned and rebuilt it . It had been stripped , re - covered with a blue skin of Low - E glass , and topped with a glass segmented - pyramid that reminded me of an artichoke . The building was filled with luxury office space , a couple of upscale restaurants , and four penthouse suites priced at twenty million dollars apiece . There were also a half - dozen condos , relatively cheap at five million each . Gage lived in one of those and Jack in another . Churchill 's youngest son , Joe , who did n't like high - rise living , had opted for a house . When Gage came by to help Churchill shower and dress , he often brought research materials for his book . They would go over the reports , articles , and estimates for a few minutes , debating one issue or another . They both seemed to take great enjoyment in these arguments . I tried to move unobtrusively through the room , taking away Churchill 's breakfast tray and bringing him more coffee , and setting out his notepad and recorder . Gage made a point of ignoring me . Understanding that the very fact of my breathing was an irritant to him , I tried to stay out of his way . We did n't speak if we passed each other on the stairs . When Gage left his keys in Churchill 's room one morning and I had to chase after him to return them , he could barely bring himself to thank me . "He
86501	86524	85679	85679	Hermes	357	" Churchill had told me . Even though I had never said a word about Gage 's coldness , it was obvious . "
86538	86916	86918	86919	a wife	3172	"We both knew it was n't true . I was the focus of a tareeted dislike . I assured Churchill it did n't bother me one bit . That was n't true either . It has always been my curse to be a pleaser . This is bad enough , but when you 're a pleaser in the company of someone who is determined to think the worst of you , you 're miserable . My only defense was to muster a dislike that equaled Gage 's , and to that end , he was being very helpful . After Gage had left , the best part of the day began . I sat in the corner with a laptop and typed in Churchill 's notes and handwritten pages , or worked from his recordings . He encouraged me to ask about anything I did n't understand , and he had a gift for explaining things in terms I could easily grasp . I made calls and wrote e - mails for him , organized his schedule , took notes when people came to the house for meetings . Churchill usually presented foreign visitors with gifts such as bolo ties or bottles of Jack Daniel 's . To Mr. Ichiro Tokegawa , a Japanese businessman Churchill had been friends with for years , we gave a chinchilla - and - beaver Stetson that cost four thousand dollars . As I sat quietly in those meetings , I was fascinated by the insights they shared and the different conclusions they drew from the same information . But even when they disagreed , it was clear that people respected Churchill 's opinions . Everyone remarked how good Churchill looked despite what he had gone through , that obviously nothing could keep him down . But it cost Churchill to maintain that appearance . After his guests left , he seemed to deflate , becoming weary and querulous . The long sedentar\ ' periods made him cold , and I was constantly filling up hot water bottles and putting throw blankets on him . When he had muscle cramps , I massaged his feet and his good leg . and helped him with toe and foot exercises to prevent adhesions . "You
86921	86936	86938	86939	a wife	3172	" I told him one morning as I came to take his breakfast tray . "I
86941	86945	86938	86939	a wife	3172	" he said . "
86982	87067	87072	87073	a husband	2422	"I could see the sense in that . There was no practical reason for Churchill to get married . It was n't like he had a problem finding female companionship . He got calls and notes from a variety of women , one of them an attractive widow named Vivian who sometimes stayed overnight . I was pretty sure they slept together , despite the logistics of maneuvering around the broken leg . After date night , Churchill was always in a good mood . "Why
87075	87079	87072	87073	a husband	2422	" Churchill countered . "
87095	87105	87106	87106	I	0	""So far I have n't found one worth marrying , "

87692	87714	87682	87682	Churchill	317	" Because I do n't see how a woman shaped like a Popsicle stick is going to give me healthy grandchildren . ""If

88017	88057	88009	88009	I	0	"Jerk , I thought , and took Churchill 's tray from the room . We did n't see Gage for two days after that . Jack was enlisted to come in his place . Since Jack had what he called "
88061	88230	87986	87986	I	0	" I had genuine worries for Churchill 's safety in the shower . Even though Jack moved , talked , and gave the appearance of a functioning human being , he was n't all there until noon . In fact , sleep inertia looked a lot like a hangover to me . Swearing , stumbling , and only half listening to what anyone said , Jack was more of a hindrance than a help . Churchill remarked testily that Jack 's sleep inertia would improve a hell of a lot if he did n't go out tomcatting half the night . Gage ; meanwhile , was bedridden with the flu . Since no one could remember the last time he 'd been sick enough to take a day off , we all agreed it must have hit him pretty hard . No one heard from him , and when forty - eight hours had passed and Gage still was n't answering the phone , Churchill began to fret . "I'm
88237	88248	88254	88254	him	2436	" I said . Churchill replied with a noncommittal grunt . "Dawnelle
88256	88346	88347	88347	you	2437	" I said . That earned me a glance of sour skepticism . I was tempted to point out that his brothers should visit him . Then I recalled that Joe had gone to St. Simon 's Island with his girlfriend for a couple of days . And Jack 's caretaking abilities had been pushed to their limits after helping his father shower two mornings in a row . I was pretty certain he would flat - out refuse to go to any more trouble for ailing family members . "Do
88355	88406	88347	88347	you	2437	" I asked reluctantly . It was my night off , and I had planned to go out to a movie with Angie and some of the girls from Salon One . I had n't seen them in a while and I was looking forward to catching up with them . "

But I had never expected Gage , of all people , to get involved in our project . I did n't know whether he 'd been recruited by Carrington or if he 'd offered on his own , and I was n't certain why it made me uneasy to see them working together so companionably . Patiently Gage showed Carrington how to make the wired circuit , how to hold the screwdriver and twist it . He held the pieces of a little switch box together as she glued it . Carrington glowed at his quiet praise , her small face animated as they worked together . Unfortunately the added weight of the bulb and wiring caused the pipe cleaner legs to collapse beneath the model . I had to bite back a sudden grin as Gage and Carrington contemplated the prostrate insect . "It
95360	95410	95414	95414	Carrington	254	" Carrington said , and the three of us snorted with laughter . It took Gage another half hour to reinforce the bug 's legs with clothes hanger wire . After setting the finished project in the middle of the kitchen table , he turned the kitchen lights off . "

Her slight body sped above the ground , too high , too fast , the legs of her jeans flapping . She let out a shriek of enjoyment . My vision blurred for a moment , my teeth clenching on a pained sound . I half staggered , half ran . reaching Gage almost at the same time she did . He caught her easily , plucking her from the pulley and swinging her to the ground . The two of them laughed , whooped , neither noticing my approach . I heard Churchill calling my name from the patio , but I did n't answer him . "I

A cold wind struck me in the face , needling the inner corners of my eyes , and I realized I was about to cry . I looked at the two of them standing together , and I heard Churchill call my name . Me against the three of them . I turned away abruptly , hardly able to see through the bitter slick of tears . Time to retreat . I walked with fast , digging strides . As I passed the man in the wheelchair , I growled , "
97010	97272	97008	97008	Churchill	317	" without breaking pace . By the time I reached the warm sanctuary of the kitchen , I was cold to the bone . I sought out the darkest , most sheltered part of the kitchen , the narrow recessed niche of the butler 's pantry . The space was lined with glass - fronted china cabinets . I did n't stop until I was hidden at the back of it . I wrapped my arms around myself , shrinking , trying to take up as little physical space as possible . Every instinct screamed that Carrington was mine , and no one had the right to dispute my judgments . I had taken care of her . sacrificed for her . You 're not my mom . Ingrate ! Traitor ! I wanted to stomp outside and tell her how easy it would have been for me to give her away after Mama died , how much better off I might have been . Mama ... oh , I wished I could take back all the hateful things my teenage self had said to her . Now I understood the injustice of parenting . Try to keep them healthy and safe , and you got blame instead of gratitude , rebellion instead of cooperation . Someone came into the kitchen . I heard the door close . I held still , praying I would n't have to talk to anyone . But a dark shadow moved through the unlit kitchen , too substantial to belong to anyone other than Gage . "Liberty?"After

98075	98099	98039	98039	Gage	331	" I protested through dry lips . He eased my head back , bent over me . A mocking whisper tickled my ear . "
98109	98249	98039	98039	Gage	331	"He was right . I had been so naive to think that somehow we were going to visit theTravises ' world like a pair of tourists , participating without becoming involved . But somehow connections had been formed , my heart had found purchase in unexpected places . I was involved more than I had ever dreamed possible . I began to tremble . There was a low tightening in my stomach as Gage 's mouth wandered to the edge of my jaw , the corner of my lips . I backed away from him until my shoulders came up hard against the cabinets , causing a delicate rattle of china and crystal . Gage 's supporting arm forced an arch at the small of my back . With every breath I took , my chest lifted against his . "Liberty
98257	98789	98790	98790	Liberty	196	"I could n't talk or move , just waited helplessly as his mouth eased over mine . I closed my eyes , opening to the taste of him , to slow kisses that explored without demand , while his hand moved to cradle the side of my face . Disarmed by his gentleness , I let my body relax against his . He searched more deeply , nudging , caressing , still with that maddening restraint , until my heart was pumping as if I 'd run a marathon . Closing his hand in the heavy mass of my hair , he held it aside and kissed my neck , taking forever to work his way up to the hollow behind my ear . By the time he had reached it . I was twisting to get closer to him , my fingers gripping the unyielding surface of his upper arms . With a murmur , he took my wrists and drew them around his shoulders . I wobbled on my sneakered toes , straining in every muscle . He held me firmly , anchoring me against the hard framework of his body , and took my mouth again . This time his kisses were longer , grinding , wet . deeply consuming , and I could n't catch my breath . I molded all my weight against him until there was n't a millimeter of space between us . He kissed me as if he were already inside me , greedy kisses with teeth , tongue , lips , kisses of unbearable sweetness that made me want to pass out but instead I clung to his body and moaned into his mouth . His hands slid to my bottom , cupped me snugly against a hard jutting pressure that felt like nothing else in the world , and the desire turned into madness . I wanted him to bear me down to the floor , I wanted him to do anything , everything . His mouth ate at mine , licked deep , and every thought and impulse dissolved into a hum of white noise , raw pleasure rising to the top of my skull . His hand slipped beneath the hem of my shirt , finding the skin of my back , which was flushed and tender as if I 'd been scalded . The cool brush of his fingers was an unspeakable relief . I arched in frantic welcome , while his hand spread like an unfolding fan . traveling up my spine . The kitchen door burst open . We sprang apart , and I lurched a few feet away from Gage , throbbing in every part of my body . I fumbled with my shirt , trying to pull it into place . Gage stayed at the back of the pantry , arms braced on the cabinets , head lowered . I saw the muscles bunch beneath his clothes . His body was rigid with frustration ; it came off him in waves . I was shocked by my response to him , the pure erotic burn of it . I heard Carrington 's uncertain voice . "

98811	98854	98855	98855	Liberty	196	"I went to the far end of the kitchen where my sister was standing . Her small face was tense and anxious , her hair comically wild like a troll doll 's . She looked as if she were going to cry . "
98857	98887	98855	98855	Liberty	196	"When you love a child , you forgive her before she can even ask . Basically you 've already forgiven her for things she has n't even done yet . "

99571	99773	99780	99780	he	2612	"Gage disappeared for the rest of the day . having suddenly remembered a few urgent errands that would occupy him indefinitely . I was relieved . I needed some time to think about what had happened and how I was going to react to it . According to Churchill 's book , the best way to deal with a strategic inflection point is to move quickly past denial into acceptance of change , and plan your strategy for the future . After considering everything carefully . I decided the kiss with Gage had been a moment of insanity , and he probably regretted it . Therefore , the best strategy was to pretend nothing had happened . I was going to be calm , relaxed , and impersonal . I was so determined to show Gage how unaffected I had been by the whole thing , to amaze him with my cool sophistication , that it was a letdown when Jack arrived in the morning . Balefully Jack said Gage had given him no advance notice , just called him at the crack of dawn and said to get his ass over to help Dad , he could n't make it . "What
99790	99817	99857	99857	his	317	" Churchill asked testily . As much as Jack did n't want to be there helping him . Churchill did n't want him there even more . "He

100999	101224	100927	100927	I	0	""Okay!"Sighing heavily , I went to the elevator . Usually I took the stairs , but not when I was wearing three - inch heels . The house was strangely quiet except for the staccato of my metallic slides across marble flooring , clicks softening on hardwood , disappearing in the pile of wool carpeting . The family room was empty , a fire winking and snapping in the fireplace . Perplexed , I went to the wet bar and sorted through decanters and bottles . I figured since I was n't driving , and Churchill was forcing me to go out with the family , he owed me a drink . I poured some cola into a glass , added a shot of Zaya rum , and stirred it with my forefinger . As I took a medicinal gulp , the cold liquid slid down my throat with a sparkling bum . Maybe I 'd added a little too much Zaya . It was my misfortune to turn and catch sight of Gage entering the room while I was still in mid - swallow . I struggled for a second to keep from spewing the drink . After managing to force it down , I started to cough violently , setting aside the glass . Gage was at my side in an instant . "
101231	101259	100927	100927	I	0	" he asked sympathetically , rubbing circles on my back . I nodded and continued to cough , my eyes watering . He looked concerned and amused . "

I noticed two things right away — first , Gage was alone , and second , he was outrageously sexy in a black cashmere turtleneck and gray pants and black Prada loafers . The last cough sputtered away , and I found myself staring helplessly into light crystalline eyes . "
101340	101351	101263	101263	I	0	" I said lamely . A smile touched his lips . "
101354	101411	101263	101263	I	0	"I was filled with dangerous heat , standing there with Gage . I felt happy just being near him , and miserable for any number of reasons , and humiliated by the desire to throw myself at him , and the turmoil of feeling all those things at once was almost more than I could stand .

It 's a car for rich people who do n't like to flaunt it , which is why you do n't see many Maybachs in Houston . For about three hundred thousand dollars you get an exterior so understated that parking lot attendants rarely put it in the front along with the BMWs or Lexuses . The interior is fitted with glove leather and glossy amboyna hardwood carried out of an Indonesian jungle on the backs of elephants . Not to mention two video screens , two champagne flute holders , and a built - in minirefrigerator designed to hold a split of Cristal . And all of it can go from zero to sixty in less than five seconds . Gage helped me into the low - slung car and reached in to buckle my seat belt . I relaxed into the seat , breathing in the smell of polished leather and staring at a front dash that resembled the interior of a small aircraft . The Maybach purred as we pulled away from the house . Driving with one hand . Gage picked something up from the center console . He held up a cell phone and gave me a brief glance . "

After Gage explained to the hostess that the Travis party had gone from nine to two , she led us to one of the small tables in the corner , which was partially concealed by a curtainlike panel to allow for privacy . While Gage looked through a wine list the size of a phone book , a solicitous waiter filled our water glasses and draped a napkin across my lap . After Gage chose the wine , we ordered artichoke soup sprinkled with shreds of caramelized Maine lobster , plates of California abalone , skillet - roasted sole from Dover accompanied by a hot salad of New Zealand eggplant and peppers .

I nodded to indicate yes , I was tired , although it was n't true . I was nervous . Now that we were back in familiar territory , I found it difficult not to slip into my old cautions . We stopped by the door , and I turned to face him . My balance was uncertain in the high heels . I must have swayed a little , because he reached out and took my waist in his hands , fingers resting on the upper slope of my hips . My closed hands formed a small barricade between us . Words tumbled from my lips — I thanked him for dinner , tried to express how much I 'd enjoyed it ... My voice faded as Gage pulled me close and pressed his lips to my forehead . "I'm

His wide , firm mouth moved to my cheek , touched it in a gentle brand . "

108629	108863	108625	108625	I	0	"As the night unfolded , we established that not only was I not bad in bed , I was phenomenal . A prodigy , Gage claimed . We shared a bottle of wine , showered together , and got back into bed . We kissed voraciously , as if we had n't already kissed a thousand times . And by morning I had done things with Gage Travis that were illegal in at least nine states . It seemed there was nothing he did n't like , nothing he was n't willing to do . He was wickedly patient and so thorough that I felt as if I had been taken apart and reassembled in a different way . Exhausted and sated , I slept curled against his side . I woke as weak morning sunlight pushed through the window . I felt Gage yawn over my head , and his body tensed in a shivering stretch . It all seemed too wonderful to be real , the heavy masculine form beside mine , the subtle stings and aches that reminded me of the night 's pleasures . The hand that rested gently on my bare hip . I was afraid he might vanish , this lover who had possessed andexplored me with such gentleness , and he would be replaced by the cool - eyed and distant man I had known before . "Don't

108909	109444	109578	109578	her	2720	" he said , and settled me back against him . Houstonians like to do things in a big way . and a River Oaks mansion debut is no exception . There were many events taking place on Saturday night , but the guest list everyone wanted to be on was for a big charity gala at the home of Peter and Sascha Legrand . The oil company executive and his wife , a city councilwoman , were using the occasion to introduce their brand - new mansion , an Italian - Mediterranean palace with ten antique porticoes imported from Europe and a thirty - six - hundred - square - foot ballroom that covered the entire second floor . The Travises had been invited , of course , and Gage had asked me to go with him . It was n't exactly your average second date . The life section in the Chronicle had shown preview pictures of the mansion , including the fourteen - foot - high Chihuly chandelier that hung in the grand foyer . The amazing glass creation looked like a cluster of giant half - open flowers of blue , amber , and orange . Intended for the benefit of a charitable foundation for the arts , the gala was operathemed , which meant singers from the Houston Opera would entertain . With my limited knowledge of opera , I imagined singers in Viking helmets and long braids who would blow our hair back with their voices . The four alcoves of the grand foyer had been decorated to represent famous opera houses in Venice and Milan . At the terraced back yard of the mansion , piazzas had been specially built on platforms just for the party , with buffets offering specialties from different regions of Italy . Armies of white - gloved waiters were available to serve the guests ' every need . I had spent the equivalent of two weeks ' salary on a white Nicole Miller dress with a halter top that wrapped and twisted neatly down to my hips , then fell in soft folds to the floor . It was a sexy but ladylike dress with a vee neckline . My shoes were Stuart Weitzman , a pair of clear Lucite sandals with crystals on the heels and toe straps . Cinderella shoes , Carrington had said when she saw them . I had scraped my hair back so it was flat and shining against my head , and twisted it into an artfully messy knot in back . After carefully applying sooty eye makeup , delicate pink lip gloss , and subtle blush , I stared at my reflection critically . I had no earrings that went with the dress . But I needed a little something else . After a few seconds ' thought , I went to Carrington 's room , looked in her art supplies box , and found a sheet of self - adhesive crystals . I took one of the smallest ones , not much bigger than the head of a pin . and applied it near the outside corner of my eye like a beauty mark . "Does
109449	109506	109578	109578	her	2720	" I asked Carrington . who could n't keep from jumping up and down on the bed . Asking an eight - year - old girl if something is a little over - the - top is like asking a Texan if there are too many jalapenos in the salsa . The answer is always no . "It
109510	109520	109578	109578	her	2720	" Carrington was ready to launch herself into orbit . "No
109523	109539	109578	109578	her	2720	" I reminded her . and she flopped down on her stomach with a grin . "Are

110905	111110	110878	110878	he	331	" I said , and took his ami . Limos were parked three deep on the street outside the Legrand mansion . The building was remarkable in its scale and style ; it seemed more a place for people to visit than to actually live in . I started having fun the moment we entered the grand foyer , which seemed like some elaborate European carnival . The crowd of men dressed in black formal wear were a perfect backdrop for the women 's colorful evening gowns . Jewels glittered at throats and wrists and fingers and ears , and light scattered like falling jewels from the overhead chandelier . Music from a live orchestra was piped into every part of the house . Sascha Legrand , a tall , slim woman with frosted hair cut in stylish angles , insisted on taking us through a partial tour of the house . She often paused to plunge us into conversation with one group or another , then withdrew us before the conversation became too involved . I was amazed by the variety of guests ... a small group of young actors , producers , and directors who had moved to Hollywood and called themselves the "
111114	111529	111530	111530	God	201	" an Olympic gymnastics gold medalist , a Rockets guard , the pastor of a nationally known megachurch , some people rich from oil , some people rich from ranching , and even a foreign aristocrat here or there . Gage was accomplished at this kind of situation , knowing everyone 's names , remembering to ask about their golf games or their hunting dogs , or how dove season had gone , or did they still have that place in Andorra or Mazatlan . Even in this high - impact crowd , people were excited and flattered by his interest . With his cool charisma and elusive smile , his aura of breeding and education . Gage was dazzling . And he knew it . I might havebeen intimidated , except that I still carried in my mind the images of a very different Gage , not nearly so self - possessed , shivering at my touch . The contrast between our formal circumstances and the memory of him in bed caused a hum of arousal inside . Nothing anyone else could perceive , but I became more aware of it every time I felt the brush of Gage 's arm against mine , or the heat of his breath as he murmured in my ear . I found it relatively easy to make small talk , mainly because I did n't know enough to do anything other than ask questions , and that seemed to keep the conversation flowing . We made our way through the sparkling sea of guests , following a current that led to the terraced exterior at the back of the house . A trio of covered wooden pavilions featured cuisines from different regions of Italy . After filling their plates , people sat at tables covered in yellow cloths and lit with Italian glass oil candles , filled with fresh flowers suspended in clear liquid paraffin . We sat at a table with Jack and his girlfriend , and some of the Texas mafia , who entertained us with accounts of an indie film they were making and talked about going to Sundance in just a couple of weeks . They were so irreverent and funny , and the wine was so good , I felt giddy . It was a magical night . There would be some opera singing soon , and dancing after that , and I would be in Gage 's arms until morning . "My
111536	111575	111530	111530	God	201	" said one of the Texas mafia , a dark - haired young woman named Sydney . She was a director . It was said in a tone of observation rather than compliment , her gaze frankly assessing . "

112561	112780	112495	112495	you	0	"He chuckled and left me amid the rows of auction items . I saw Heidi and Jack examining some items several tables away , until more people entered the room and blocked my view . I studied the tables carefully . I could n't figure out what in the world Gage would want . A fancy limited - edition European motorcycle ... no way was I going to let him risk losing a limb . A Nascar experience in which you got to drive a six - hundred - horsepower stock car on a super speedway . Ditto . Private chartered yacht trips . Jewels with names . A private lunch with a beautiful soap opera actress .. .As if , I thought sardonically . After a few minutes of dedicated searching , with lively melodic arias in the background . I found something . A high - end massage chair with an intricate control panel promising at least fifteen different kinds of massage . I decided Gage could give it to Churchill for a Christmas present . Picking up a pen , I began to write Gage 's name on the bidding sheet , but the ink would n't come out . The pen was a dud . I shook it and tried again with no luck . "Here
112782	112809	112495	112495	you	0	" said a man beside me . setting a new pen on the table . He used the flat of his hand to roll it closer . "
112814	112918	112495	112495	you	0	"That hand . I stared at it dumbly , while the fine hairs on the back of my neck lifted . A big hand , the nails sun - bleached , the long fingers scattered with tiny star - shaped scars . I knew whose hand it was , I knew it from a place that went deeper than memory . But I could n't make myself believe it . Not here . Not now . I looked up into a pair of blue eyes that had haunted me for years . Eyes I would remember to the last day of my life . "Hardy
112920	113049	112495	112495	you	0	" I whispered . CHAPTER 22 I was paralyzed as I tried to take him in , this stranger I had loved so dearly . Hardy Gates had grown into all the promise of his younger years . He was a big , bold - looking man . Those eyes , blue upon blue , and the glossy brown hair , and the beginnings of a smile that sent a ripple of wonder through my soul ... All I could do was stare at him , submerged in fearsome pleasure . Hardy was still as he looked back at me . but I sensed the vibration of hard - running emotion beneath his exterior . He took my hand gently , as if I were a small child . "
113058	113362	112495	112495	you	0	"I clung to him . not caring that Jack might see us leave , not really aware of anythingexcept the clasp of those callused fingers . Hardy drew me away by the hand , away from the tables , to the waiting darkness of the outside grounds . We skirted the crowd , the noise , the lights , cutting around to the side of the house . It seemed the light tried to follow , stretchingweakening tendrils after us . but we headed into the shadows of an empty portico . We stopped in the lee of a column as thick as an oak trunk . I was winded and trembling . I do n't know who moved first , it seemed we reached for each other at the same time . I was seized full - length against him , mouth to mouth , bruising each other 's lips with kisses too hard for pleasure . My heart thundered as if I were dying . Moments of silent ravaging , and then Hardy tore his mouth away , whispering it was all right , he was n't going to let go . I began to relax in his arms , feeling the heat of his mouth as he followed the tumble of wetness on my cheeks . He kissed me again , slow and easy , the way he had taught me so long ago , and I felt safe and young and suffused with a desire so straightforward it seemed almost wholesome . His kisses tapped into deep mines of memory , and the years that had separated us fell away as if they were nothing . After a while Hardy cuddled me in the loose sides of his tux jacket , his chest hard beneath the intricately tucked shirt . "I
113369	113379	112495	112495	you	0	" I said in an ache of a whisper . "I

113483	113492	113437	113437	You	196	" He rested his cheek on my hair . "
113506	113750	113501	113501	I	0	"He spoke in the voice I had craved for so long , deeper now than in his youth . He was here at the invitation of a friend , he said , also in the oil business . He told me about starting work on the drilling rig — difficult and dangerous — and the contacts he 'd made , the opportunities he 'd watched for . Eventually he 'd quit the rig and started a small company with two other men , one a geologist , the other an engineer , with the goal of finding new pay zones in mature oil fields . At least half the oil and gas in every field in the world was overlooked , Hardy said , and there was a fortune for those willing to go after bypassed pay . They had raised about a million in financing , and on their first try in a spent Texas field , they 'd found a new zone worth an estimated two hundred and fifty thousand barrels of recoverable crude . Hardy explained enough that I understood he was already rich and going to get a lot richer . He 'd bought his mother a house . He had an apartment in Houston , which would be his home base for a while . Knowing of his fierce hunger to succeed , to rise above his circumstances , I was glad for him and I said so . "It

114179	114290	114291	114291	Liberty	196	" His arms tightened around me briefly before he let go . We drew apart and looked at each other . I was confounded by his presence , this man who was so like the boy I had known and yet so unlike him . I did n't know how the connection between us could still be there . But it was . We were the same , Hardy and me , we communicated from the same center , we had come from the same world . But Gage ... the thought of him wrenched my heart . Whatever he saw in my face caused Hardy to speak very gently . "
114304	114632	114293	114293	I	0	"I gave a little nod , staring blindly into the darkness as he left . But he had hurt me in the past , I thought . I had understood his reasons for leaving Welcome . I understood why he 'd felt he had no choice . I did n't blame him . The problem was , I had gone on with my life . And after years of struggle and considerable loneliness , I had finally connected with someone else . My feet ached in my Cinderella shoes . I shifted my weight and wiggled my toes beneath the cutting Lucite straps . My Prince Charming had finally showed up , I thought wretchedly , and he was too damn late . Not necessarily , my mind insisted . It was still possible for Hardy and me . The old obstacles were gone , and the new ones ... There is always a choice . It 's a damned uncomfortable thing to know . I ventured toward the light , fishing in the tiny purse hanging from my arm on a silk loop . I did n't know how I was going to repair the damage done to my makeup . The friction of mouth and skin and fingertips had erased the carefully applied film of color . I powdered my face , and used the tip of my ring finger to wipe smudges of liner from beneath my eyes . I reapplied my lip gloss . The tiny crystal near the corner of my eye was gone . Maybe people would n't notice . Everyone was dancing and drinking and eating ; surely by now I was n't the only one with faded makeup . As soon as I reached the back terrace I saw Gage 's dark form , tall and precise as a knife blade . He headed for me in a leisurely stride , catching my chilled upper arm in his hand . "Hey
114634	114638	114293	114293	I	0	" he said . "

He was relaxed , sort of scary - calm , which was beginning to seem worse than shouting . He took out a highball glass , poured himself a finger of hard liquor , and downed it without seeming to taste it . Silently he poured another shot and offered it to me . I took it gratefully , hoping the alcohol would thaw me out . I was freezing . I tried to down the drink as quickly as Gage had . but it burned my throat and made me sputter . "Easy
115249	115296	115097	115097	Gage	331	" Gage murmured , settling an impersonal hand on my back . Feeling the goose bumps on my skin , he took off his jacket and settled it around me . I was wrapped in the soft silk - lined fabric , warm from his body . "Thanks
115298	115302	115097	115097	Gage	331	" I wheezed . "No

Trying to keep my voice steady , I told him about Hardy , that I had known him since I was fourteen .. .that aside from my mother and sister , he 'd been the most important person inthe world to me . That I 'd loved him . It was so strange , talking to Gage about Hardy . My past and my present colliding . And it made me realize how different the Liberty Jones from the trailer park was from the woman I 'd become . I needed to think about that . I needed to think about a lot of things . "Did

And you and I .. .we've only just started a relationship . I want to be fair to you , but at the same time ... I have to find out if what I felt for Hardy is still there . Which means .. .1 need to put things between you and me on hold until I can figure this out . "Gage

116897	116904	116905	116905	His	331	" I was rough with you . "
116910	116919	116905	116905	His	331	" Damn it . I 'm sorry . I just—""S'okay
116921	116936	116905	116905	His	331	" I whispered , the last tremors of delight still echoing through my body . "It
116941	117567	116905	116905	His	331	I—"He was silenced abruptly as I pulled up enough to kiss him . He let my mouth move against his , but he did n't respond , only held me and pulled the gown back over my chest and down my naked legs , and wrapped me back up in his tux jacket . Neither of us spoke after that . I was still on sensation overload , barely registering when Gage pressed a button and spoke to the driver . Still cradling me in one arm , he poured another drink and consumed it slowly . His face gave nothing away , but I felt the ferocious tension in his body . Held securely in Gage 's lap , I drowsed a little , lulled by the car ride and the warmth ofhis body . It was a rude awakening when the car stopped and the door was opened . I blinked as Gage jostled me awake and helped me out . Knowing how messed up I was , how obvious the reason for our dishevelment . I shot a quick embarrassed glance at Phil the driver . He made a point of not looking at either of us . his expression strictly marshaled . We were at 1800 Main . Gage stared at me as if he expected me to object to spending the night at his condo . I tried to weigh the consequences of staying or leaving , but my mind was too addled . In the welter of my thoughts , only one stood out : however I chose to deal with Hardy , this man was not going to stand aside politely . Wearing Gage 's tux jacket over my dress , I went through the lobby and into the elevator with him . The rapid ascent of the elevator caused me to sway on my high heels . Gage reached for me , kissing me until I was red - faced and out of breath . I stumbled a little as he pulled me from the elevator . With an easy motion , he picked me up and carried me — actually carried me — down the hallway to his condo . We went straight to the waiting silence of the bedroom , where I was undressed in the darkness . Now , after the hasty coupling in the car , the urgency had eased into tenderness . Gage moved over me like a shadow , finding the softest places , the most acute nerves . The more he soothed , the more I ached . Breathing in long sighs , I reached for him , thirsting for the hard planes of muscle , the resilent flesh , the midnight silk of his hair . He coaxed me open , his mouth and fingers harrowing delicately until all my limbs were widespread and mybody rose in a shuddering plea to receive him , and I moaned each time he slid inside me . Again , and again , until he had gone past all boundaries , inside me . immersed , possessing and possessed . As the cowboy saying goes , a horse should n't be ridden hard and put away wet . That also applies to girlfriends , especially those who have gone a while without sex and need a little time to get back into the habit of it . I could n't say how many times Gage reached for me in the night . When I woke up in the morning , muscles I did n't even know I had were aching , and my limbs were strained and stiff . And Gage was being very considerate , starting with bringing me coffee in bed . "Don't
117574	117590	116905	116905	His	331	" I said , leaning forward as he tucked an extra pillow behind my back . "

Hardy pulled up to the front of the house and helped us out . Glancing at the garage , I saw Gage 's car . He was almost never there on Sunday afternoons .

Gage stood with Carrington still hanging around his waist , his face expressionless . I shoved my hands in my pockets . The tiny junctures between my fingers had gone damp . Both men seemed so relaxed , and yet the air was punctured with conflict . It was startling to see them together . Hardy had loomed so large in my memory for so long that I was surprised to realize Gage was equally tall , albeit leaner . They were different in almost every way , education , background , experience ... Gage , who played by the rules he 'd usually had a hand in making , and Hardy , who tossed out the rules like a handful of Texas redbacks if they did n't suit him . Gage , always the smartest one in the room , and Hardy , who had told me with a deceptively lazy smile that all he had to do was be smarter than the guy he was doing a deal with . "Congratulations

We fix dinner together , the three of us , and after eating we sit outside and talk . At times we pause to listen to the plaintive song of mourning doves , the occasional whicker of a horse in the barn , the breezes that rustle the oaks and send pecans rattling to the ground . Eventually Carrington goes upstairs to take a bath in a refurbished clawfoot tub , and she goes to sleep in a room with pale blue walls . She asks drowsily if we can paint clouds on the ceiling , and I say yes , of course we can . Gage and I sleep in the master bedroom downstairs . We make love in a king - sized poster bed , beneath hand - stitched quilts . Sensitive to my mood , Gage takes it easy and slow in the way that never fails to drive me crazy , drawing out every sensation until my heartbeat is hammering in my throat . He is strong and hard and deliberate , every gentle movement an assertion of something beyond words , something deeper and sweeter than mere passion . I go rigid in his arms , muffling a cry against his shoulder while he coaxes long , delicious shudders from my body . Then it 's my turn to hold him . I put my arms and legs around him , wrapping him tightly in myself , and he gasps out my name as he surges and quickens . We both wake up at daybreak as the wintering snow geese honk and flap across the fields on their way to breakfast .
