9681	9685	9686	9686	I	0	“ It ’s … ”
9718	9728	9729	9729	Christian	144	“ You said it was an old warehouse somewhere , ”

10580	10630	10577	10577	he	144	“ To answer your earlier question , I know she likes you because I know Luisa . It sounds counterintuitive , but whenever she ’s impressed with someone , she puts them on the back burner . She ’s more interested in grilling those she ’s not sure about . ”

11567	11572	11535	11535	she	129	“ You ’re fired . ”
11684	11690	11669	11669	she	129	“ Meredith , if I — ”
11691	11695	11696	11696	She	129	“ Do n’t . ”
11706	11749	11696	11696	She	129	“ I already know what you ’re going to say , and it wo n’t change my mind . I ’ve been watching you and your lack of enthusiasm for a while , Stella , and Saturday night was the last straw . ”

11881	11989	11872	11872	Meredith	129	“ I admit , you have a good eye for style , but so do a thousand other girls who would kill to be in your position . You clearly do n’t want to be here . I see it in your eyes every time I talk to you . Honestly , we should n’t have hired you in the first place . Your blog generates enough traffic to be considered a competitor , and our contract forbids our employees from engaging in competitive business practices . The only reason we did n’t fire you earlier was because your side job did n’t interfere with your work . ”

Your aesthetic is so fucking perfect for them , it ’s like they … it ’s like they created you in their super - secret lab . Or something . ”
13196	13224	13225	13225	I	0	“ Yes , well , Raya has more followers than me , and she has Adam . It ’s like a two - in - one deal . ”

13333	13372	13330	13330	Brady	135	“ I hate to say it , but influencer couples are what ’s hot right now . You rarely see individual influencers skyrocket like that . People love following other people ’s love lives . It ’s sick . ”

Rumor has it they wo n’t make a final decision for another few weeks . Trust me . They already love you — I know they do . You just got ta give them a little extra push . ”

I was freaked out that they knew where I lived , but the content was n’t particularly alarming . It sounded like something a high schooler would write to his secret crush . But the letters kept coming , and he started including candid pictures of me along with them . That was when I really freaked out . I installed a new security system and bought a taser , but I still did n’t feel like it was enough . Every time I left or entered my house , I … ”

49249	49305	49306	49306	She	1396	“ What they said was bullshit . It ’s not your fault . Millions of people post every fucking thing they do on social media every day . It does n’t mean they ’re inviting people to harass them . Would you blame a woman for being assaulted if she was wearing a short skirt ? ”

51018	51034	51035	51035	Kage	189	“ It is . I ’ve got intel that Rutledge might jump ship to Sentinel . ”
51044	51063	51035	51035	Kage	189	“ Not fucking good , especially after the Deacon and Beatrix situation . People are going to talk . ”

51380	51385	51386	51386	Stella	121	“ Is everything okay ? ”
51396	51401	51386	51386	Stella	121	“ That sounded intense . “
51404	51415	51386	51386	Stella	121	” I smoothed my expression into placidness before I turned . “
51425	51465	51466	51466	I	0	” If I were alone , I would ’ve already put the pieces for Sentinel ’s demise in motion . Since I was n’t , and I was with Stella , I set those pieces aside . For now . “

51494	51563	51468	51468	you	0	” I almost smiled , both because she ’d unerringly hit the nail on the head and because I spotted a glimmer of her usual sparkle in her eyes . She ’d regained her composure during my call . The rosiness had dissipated from her cheeks , and she was curled up on the couch next to that stupid purple unicorn with a faint curve of her lips . “
51580	51593	51466	51466	I	0	” I raised a brow at the mischief in her growing smile . “

51672	51680	51660	51660	We	1423	” She typed something into her phone . “
51685	51763	51660	51660	We	1423	” I opened her message , and I had to blink twice to make sure I was seeing correctly . She ’d sent a screenshot of a Stories poll . A picture of me , back turned and phone to my ear , took up the left side of the screen ; a familiar purple unicorn dominated the right side . The question was simple : Who would you rather cuddle with ? Mr. Harper or Mr. Unicorn ?
51764	51773	51774	51774	Stella	121	“ You ’re losing , by the way , ”
51777	51792	51774	51774	Stella	121	“ Mr. Unicorn is beating you fifty - three to forty - seven percent . ”
51845	51856	51857	51857	I	0	“ The poll must be broken because that ’s ridiculous . ”
51868	51889	51857	51857	I	0	“ It ’s not , but you have twenty - three hours and fifty - one minutes to catch up . ”

52796	52821	52822	52822	His	121	“ Ninety percent . He came back with concerns after reviewing the contract , and I ’d prefer to address them in person tonight . ”
52828	52843	52822	52822	His	121	“ When was the last time you left your apartment ? You ’re wilting . ”

53196	53202	53187	53187	His	121	“ Not blackmailing . Persuading . ”

That ’s incredible . And … before I say this , I want you to know this had nothing to do with our decision … but Christian has always had exquisite taste . I ’m not surprised that extends to his love life . He ’s never had a real girlfriend before , so the fact you ’re dating is quite revealing . ”

He ’ll be unobtrusive ; you wo n’t even know he ’s there unless you need help . Finally … ”

66134	66145	66146	66146	I	0	“ So that ’s why I moved in with Christian , ”
66149	66166	66146	66146	I	0	“ It ’s the safest thing to do while the stalker is still on the loose . ”
66209	66214	66215	66215	Ava	162	“ Yes , but … ”
66221	66280	66215	66215	Ava	162	“ I ’m sorry . I still ca n’t get over the part where this started three years ago , and you did n’t tell me . This is n’t a secret boyfriend or … or a side gig moonlighting as a dancer , Stella . You ’re my best friend , and your life was in danger . ”

I was just frustrated in the moment . Bridal nerves , you know . I ’m fine now . Yes , I promise ... why did I call for you ? Uh , I ’m craving those new raspberry lemon cookies from Crumble & Bake . Can you please run down and get some for me ? Thank you ! Love you . ”

90082	90111	90114	90114	Josh	161	“ I ’m a doctor , and I still ca n’t find a medical reason for why girls always have to use the bathroom at the same time , ”
90120	90126	90127	90127	Alex	163	“ You ’re an idiot , ”
90148	90160	90134	90134	Jules	136	“ Why do I feel like this is an FBI interrogation ? ”
90172	90177	90161	90161	I	0	“ Because it is . ”
90191	90216	90180	90180	her	136	“ Now , tell us the truth . Are you , Stella Alonso , having or have ever had sexual intercourse with Christian Harper ? ”
90217	90220	90180	90180	her	136	“ No . ”
90221	90227	90180	90180	her	136	“ Do you want to ? ”
90240	90245	90180	90180	her	136	“ I knew it ! ”
90253	90294	90249	90249	Jules	136	“ I ’m so happy for you ! Finally , someone you ’re attracted to . Christian is crazy hot , and you ’re living in the same house . It ’s like the perfect setup for a sexy fling . ”
90300	90309	90310	90310	she	137	“ I thought this was a fake relationship , ”
90314	90318	90310	90310	she	137	“ What changed ? ”
90319	90331	90332	90332	I	0	“ Like Jules said , he ’s pretty good - looking . ”
90368	90371	90356	90356	my	0	“ Also … ”
90438	90454	90455	90455	Jules	136	“ I had a feeling he was into you since the day we met him , ”
90459	90474	90475	90475	She	2206	“ The way he looked at you when we signed the lease ? Whew . ”
90479	90528	90477	90477	herself	2206	“ Listen , if you want to leave and bang his brains out , I wo n’t be offended . It ’s a new season , babe . Time to clear out those cobwebs from your sex life . It ’ll be like spring cleaning for your vagina . ”
90536	90546	90529	90529	I	0	“ I would n’t jump into anything that fast . ”
90554	90598	90550	90550	Bridget	137	“ Christian is , well , you know my thoughts about him already . I ’m forever grateful he helped me and Rhys with our photo leak problem , but he ’s not someone you turn to if you want a serious relationship . ”
90599	90610	90611	90611	Jules	136	“ That ’s why I said bang , not date , ”
90614	90630	90611	90611	Jules	136	“ I bet he ’s a beast in bed . He just has that look . ”
90636	90654	90611	90611	Jules	136	“ What would Josh say if he knew you were secretly assessing other men ’s sexual prowess ? ”
90655	90678	90679	90679	Jules	136	“ He ’d say he ’s still better than them , and he ’d be right . Our sex life is fantastic . ”
90687	90690	90679	90679	Jules	136	“ Sorry . ”
90691	90705	90706	90706	Ava	162	“ I ’m going to pretend I did n’t hear that last part . ”
90744	90764	90730	90730	She	162	“ The question is , do you want just sex with him ? Or do you want something more ? ”
90765	90771	90772	90772	Jules	136	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , ”
90775	90785	90772	90772	Jules	136	“ Stel is n’t interested in dating . Right ? ”
90804	90807	90793	90793	I	0	“ Oh . ”
90816	90819	90808	90808	Jules	136	“ Oh . ”
90871	90874	90876	90876	you	121	“ What the hell
90882	90883	90876	90876	you	121	” “
90893	90899	90876	90876	you	121	” I raised my glass . “

90920	90964	90914	90914	I	0	” Rhys had been grumbling and brooding since I arrived , which was n’t a huge departure from his usual demeanor , but now that the girls were out of the room , he turned the full force of his ire on me . “
90981	90991	90992	90992	I	0	” I laced my tone with carefully crafted disappointment . “
91011	91069	91003	91003	they	2211	” I used friendship in the loosest sense of the term . Our rocky , complicated relationship started with Rhys saving my life and him walking away from Harper Security to be with Bridget . The path between those points had been riddled with disagreements , barbs , and a strange mix of mutual respect and suspicion . “
91076	91108	91074	91074	Harper	121	” Rhys ’s glare crackled with irritation . Classic Larsen . If he brooded any harder , he ’d require a plastic surgeon to carve the frown out of his face . “

91157	91161	91148	91148	You	121	” I drawled . “
91167	91217	91218	91218	I	0	” The air dripped with silent danger , but no one seemed concerned except for the royal bodyguards shifting uneasily in the back of the room . Josh watched our back and forth with fascination from Rhys ’s other side while Alex scrolled through his phone , looking bored . “
91225	91229	91218	91218	I	0	” Rhys growled . “
91255	91256	91250	91250	I	0	” “
91262	91276	91259	91259	I	0	” I swirled my drink in its glass before taking a thoughtful sip . “
91314	91321	91322	91322	You	121	” Josh snorted out a laugh . “
91326	91334	91322	91322	You	121	” Rhys said without looking at him . “
91351	91435	91438	91438	I	0	” Josh ’s smile disappeared . Alex looked up from his phone , those cold green eyes drilling into my skin for the first time since I arrived . We had n’t acknowledged each other beyond an obligatory nod of greeting . We didn’ts hide our quasi friendship , but we did n’t announce it to the world either because there was nothing to announce . Other than our monthly chess matches and the occasional business interaction , we rarely saw each other . “
91442	91460	91438	91438	I	0	” Josh said , doing a one - eighty as he directed his next question at me . “
91468	91469	91463	91463	your	0	” “
91487	91566	91480	91480	I	0	” A lie . Magda had inadvertently fallen into his hands before Dante bought it off him , which meant I knew every single thing about Josh Chen . His family background , his grades in med school , his favorite basketball team and how he took his coffee . He was a golden boy with a dark streak , but not one I needed to concern myself with now that Magda was no longer in his possession . “
91598	91602	91596	91596	yourself	0	” Josh said . “
91615	91673	91674	91674	You	0	” I sighed , regretting my decision to attend this damned party . If Stella had n’t been so adamant about attending , I could ’ve spent the day doing something more productive , like hunting down her stalker , reorganizing my library , or finishing yesterday ’s crossword . Anything was better than this insufferable conversation . “
91677	91684	91685	91685	Bridget	137	” Rhys ’s expression turned speculative . “
91718	91734	91713	91714	some creep	2193	” The speculation morphed into a knowing glint that set off a dozen warning bells . “
91759	91760	91748	91748	you	0	” “
91766	91854	91763	91763	my	0	” I flicked a piece of lint off my sleeve , the picture of undisturbed calm , even as unease glided through my chest . Rhys was a royal pain in my ass , not only because he was one of the few people unafraid to stand up to me , but because he was observant as fuck and knew me better than anyone except Dante . My annoyance ratcheted up another notch when he examined me with … amusement ? What the fuck was so funny ? “
91861	91867	91858	91858	you	0	” Humor lengthened his drawl . “
91873	91874	91871	91871	Harper	121	” “
91883	91895	91871	91871	Harper	121	” My back teeth clenched before I caught myself and relaxed . “

91925	91936	91921	91921	I	0	” His low chuckle sharpened the edges of my displeasure . “
91952	91971	91943	91943	I	0	” Beside him , Josh ’s fingers flew over his phone with alarming speed . My eyes narrowed . “
91977	91978	91973	91973	you	0	” “
91999	92005	92013	92014	Jesus Christ	190	” He checked his phone . “

92130	92164	92216	92216	Josh	161	“ Do n’t start with me . At least I did n’t give up my company to follow a girl around for a year in hopes she would spare me a second glance . ”
92165	92186	92187	92187	Alex	163	“ Yet I have the girl and you ’re sitting on a couch arguing with her friends ’ significant others , ”
92191	92211	92187	92187	Alex	163	“ If you do n’t have feelings for Stella , you would n’t be so worked up over it . ”
92212	92215	92216	92216	Josh	161	“ Exactly . ”
92242	92273	92236	92236	My	0	“ I would spend more time improving your chess skills and less worrying about other people ’s business , Josh . I ’ve beat Alex in chess . Have you ? ”
92279	92299	92300	92300	He	161	“ What do you mean , you ’ve beat Alex in chess ? When did you play chess together ? ”
92307	92317	92302	92302	his	161	“ You ’ve been playing chess with someone else ? ”

92376	92403	92372	92372	Josh	161	“ You have another , secret best friend ? But … I’m your best friend ! I bought you a banana float for your bachelor party ! ”
92404	92421	92422	92422	Alex	163	“ I do n’t want a banana float , and he ’s not my best friend . ”
92466	92477	92478	92478	Josh	161	“ I ca n’t believe it . Standing chess date , ”
92482	92511	92478	92478	Josh	161	“ Was that why you would n’t watch the latest Marvel movie with me ? Because you know I ’ve been dying to see that movie for weeks … ”
92530	92544	92545	92545	My	0	“ Wait till I tell Bridget . She ’s going to love this . ”

But she has n’t been your nanny in more than a decade , and you are n’t swimming in money , Stella . You ’re unemployed , for Christ ’s sake . Even when you worked at D.C. Style , your salary was pitiful . Spending tens of thousands of dollars a year caring for a former family employee when you ’re not financially stable is the most irresponsible , foolish — ”
96291	96309	96277	96277	She	130	“ Maura is family . She was more of a mother to me than you ever were ! ”

97415	97543	97544	97544	I	0	“ Look at how you reacted . Instead of supporting her , you attacked her . Instead of being proud of her drive and passion , you force her into a box she does n’t belong in . Stella is one of the most selfless , creative , and brilliant people I know , yet you belittle her for not conforming to your limited definitions of success . Why ? Because you ’re embarrassed to have a child who dared stray from the rigid path you yourself took ? Your pride matters more to you than her happiness , yet you ’re surprised that she considers the only adult who was there for her growing up to be more of a parent than either of you were . ”

You know everything about me , and I know nothing about you . You want other people to be an open book while you keep yours closed . I thought you were so thoughtful and perceptive because you knew all these things about me . My favorite foods , my favorite flowers … but you had that stupid dossier the whole time .

154265	154278	154279	154279	Kurtz	176	“ Then why the fuck did you tell him about the copy ? ”

154311	154343	154308	154308	Kage	189	“ Keep his trust . He was getting suspicious about why it was taking me so long to figure out what happened . It ’s that damn woman he ’s dating . ”

154454	154495	154440	154440	Kurtz	176	“ You know Harper . He ’s so blinded by hubris he thinks he can handle anything and that no one would dare betray him . I would ’ve loved to see his face when he found out about Axel . ”
154499	154540	154496	154496	Kage	189	“ That fucker was getting on my nerves . Always trying to kiss ass and one - up me . Thank fuck we made him the fall guy and Harper fell for it . One less problem on my plate . ”
154604	154652	154653	154653	Kurtz	176	“ Yes , well , that had to be done . Too bad we never figured out what was so special about that hideous painting . Went through all that trouble to get it only to have to sell it before Harper traced it back to us , ”
154656	154670	154671	154671	Kage	189	“ That ’s one thing he never told anyone , not even me . ”

154839	154854	154833	154833	He	189	“ Things change . No one wants to live in another ’s shadow forever . ”

154884	154928	154929	154929	He	189	“ You know , when you first contacted us , I thought you were setting me up , but you ’ve proven to be a useful ally . I ’ve been dying to see Harper taken down a peg or two for years . ”

I ’m the one who runs the day - to - day operations while you jet set around the world with your fucking private plane and fancy hotels . Yours is the name on the door . You ’re the one everyone fawns over . You ’re the CEO , and I ’m a fucking employee . I ’m not your partner . I ’m just a soldier in your command . Every time I go somewhere , people only ask me about you . I ’m sick of it . ”

155578	155631	155574	155574	I	0	“ Enough that you would run to our biggest competitor and fuck over your friend and what you said you helped build . You could ’ve talked to me , but you fucking did n’t . That does n’t make you a hero , Kage . That makes you a goddamn coward . ”
155765	155824	155753	155753	I	0	“ At least Sentinel appreciates what I ’m doing for them , and I got to see you brought down a notch . It ’s been fun playing spy . Sabotaging you from the inside and you did n’t even know it because you were so caught up with your fucking girlfriend while I kept the company running . ”
155831	155881	155825	155825	Kage	189	“ You have n’t treated me like a friend in a long time , Christian . You treat me like a dumb lackey you can just order around . Like you would n’t be lying dead with a bullet in your head if I had n’t saved your ass . ”

I told you how I felt with my letters , but I had to make something of myself before I knew you ’d accept me . It ’s why I did n’t contact you earlier . But now … ”

159396	159471	159472	159472	He	3607	“ That ’s the best part ! I have an apartment in the Mirage as well . My grandmother passed it on to me after she died . I do n’t live there full time , but I have the keys . We ’re practically neighbors . I was so upset when you did n’t notice me the one time we shared an elevator , but you were too busy looking at your phone . ”
159558	159623	159624	159624	He	3607	“ It was harder to hack into the surveillance system , but I had help for that . I hired Sentinel Security . They ’re Harper ’s biggest competitor , and I figured they ’d take any opportunity to take him down a peg . I was right . They gave me some fancy device I could use , and the rest is history . ”
159647	159689	159690	159690	He	3607	“ I did all that for you , Stella . Because I love you . I only wish I had n’t left you for two years . Unfortunately , I had to go back home and take care of my grandmother . ”
159694	159729	159690	159690	He	3607	“ She was the one who left me the apartment and all the money we could need . She was big on real estate , and since my parents died , I got everything . ”

159756	159809	159747	159747	Disapproval	274	“ But I ’m back , and you ’re out of that asshole ’s house . I had to lay low for a while after I returned , you know . Could n’t risk Harper tracking me down . The good part is , I had time to plan all this out . ”
159821	159860	159861	159861	He	3608	“ We can finally be together after we fix you . I do n’t think it ’ll take long , though . A few weeks with me and you ’ll see . We ’re meant to be together . ”

I did n’t know why . Maybe because I resented what art had done to my family , and I liked seeing its ugliness and chaos immortalized on canvas . I had her note as well , and when I was older , I reworked the frame and placed it inside the painting . The most fucked up part was , I named it after her . Magda . ”
