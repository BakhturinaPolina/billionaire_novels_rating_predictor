I ’m giving you the gift of turning you down . Take it and run for the hills . ”

7488	7543	7476	7476	I	0	“ Well , I asked for a threesome with Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift . Looks like we both ai n’t getting our wish , doll . The fact of the matter is , you ’re married to Paxton Veitch , and Paxton Veitch owes me money . A shit - ton of it . ”
7544	7551	7552	7552	I	0	“ Exactly . Paxton owes you , ”
7573	7602	7603	7603	Colin	179	“ He was the one placing those bets . He was the one losing money at your joints . It ’s his mess to fix , not mine . ”

7932	7976	7977	7977	I	0	“ We both know I have n’t the greenest clue where to start looking . His phone is dead , my emails are bouncing back , and his friends wo n’t talk to me . It ’s not like I have n’t tried . ”
8003	8034	8035	8035	Byrne	179	“ Then I ’m afraid his debt is now yours . Whatever happened to in sickness and in health ? For richer or poorer ? How does the oath go ? ”

8190	8295	8177	8177	He	179	“ Sorry , Persephone . It ’s nothing personal . I have a debt to collect , and if I do n’t collect it soon , people are going to assume it ’s okay to take money from me without paying me back . If you ’re interested in reimbursing me through a different currency , I can stitch together a plan . I ’m not an unreasonable man . But no matter how you look at it — you will pay your husband ’s debt , and you better hurry , because the interest is stacking up nicely as the weeks tick by . ”
8296	8302	8177	8177	He	179	“ What are you insinuating ? ”
8389	8410	8381	8381	I	0	“ I ’m saying if you ca n’t pay the outstanding balance , you ’ll have to work for it . ”

8912	8966	8967	8967	He	179	“ Then I ’ll have to make an example out of you . Which , I assure you , Mrs. Veitch , would hurt me more than it would you . It is always a sad state of affairs when the wife has to take on the burden of her husband ’s mistakes . ”
8985	9026	8974	8974	his	179	“ But if I let this slide , I ’ll lose my street cred . You will pay . Either in money , with the thing between your legs , or with your blood . Catch you later , Persy . ”
9185	9198	9199	9199	Belle	148	“ Pers ? Jeez , dude . There ’s a thunderstorm outside . ”
9403	9438	9439	9439	I	0	“ Sorry about that . Shannon ’s parents went to a drive - in and must ’ve gotten carried away . I did n’t even know drive - ins still existed . Did you ? ”
9560	9618	9619	9619	She	718	“ Drive - ins ? Sure . Some of my favorite sexcapades happened at the Solano drive - in . But it ’s been raining so hard , I doubt they could watch anything there . You really should ’ve called me . I ’d have picked you up . You know tonight is my night off . ”
9678	9687	9676	9676	Ross	190	“ You already do too much for me . ”
9688	9709	9730	9730	her	718	“ That ’s because that bastard , Pax , screwed you over . Remind me why you married him again ? ”
9710	9713	9676	9676	Ross	190	“ Love ? ”
9736	9745	9725	9725	I	0	“ I thought I was respecting our pact . ”

10274	10297	10268	10268	Belle	148	“ Do you still believe in love after Pax took a dump all over the concept , then set it on fire ? ”
10298	10301	10302	10302	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
10315	10320	10321	10321	My	0	“ Pathetic , right ? ”

10428	10431	10411	10411	she	148	“ Belle ? ”
10437	10440	10441	10441	She	148	“ Hmm ? ”
10458	10470	10441	10441	She	148	“ What do you think is going to happen with Pax ? ”
10489	10518	10519	10519	Belle	148	“ I ca n’t stay married to him forever , right ? I ’ll be relieved from this marriage at some point if he does n’t show up ? ”
10538	10604	10533	10533	she	148	“ Well , marriage is not a public restroom . I ’m not sure you can be relieved from it , but you for sure can get out of this if you put your mind to it . The man has n’t been around in almost a year . You need to save up , get a good lawyer , and finish with this mess . ”

10648	10653	10654	10654	I	0	“ With what money ? ”
10657	10676	10654	10654	I	0	“ And please , do n’t offer me another loan . I ’m just going to refuse it . ”
10748	10787	10788	10788	Her	148	“ Let ’s say you ’re too proud to take money from me — your own sister , mind you — and still want legal representation . I would just go to Sailor and ask for a loan . ”
10795	10850	10788	10788	Her	148	“ The Fitzpatricks have enough fuck - you money to build a dick - shaped statue the size of Lady Liberty . Sailor wo n’t be hard - pressed to get it back , you ’ll have zero interest , and she knows you ’re good for it . You ’ll pay it eventually . ”
10851	10856	10857	10857	I	0	“ I ca n’t . ”
10862	10865	10857	10857	I	0	“ Why ? ”

10921	10930	10931	10931	I	0	“ I do n’t have an eating disorder . ”
10939	10991	10934	10934	Belle	148	“ Bitch , I know . Your ass inhaled three Cheesecake Factory meals just eight months ago and washed it all down with margaritas , Tums , and regret . You ’re going through something , and I want you to snap out of it . Ask Sailor for the money ! ”
10992	10997	10998	10998	I	0	“ Are you insane ? ”
11007	11025	10998	10998	I	0	“ She does n’t have time for my drama . She just told us she was pregnant . ”
11076	11079	11080	11080	Belle	148	“ And ? ”
11085	11104	11082	11082	her	148	“ She can be preggo and give you money , you know . Women are known for multitasking . ”
11105	11123	11082	11082	her	148	“ She ’ll get worried . Plus , I do n’t want to be that loser friend . ”
11124	11133	11082	11082	her	148	“ It ’s just a few thousand dollars . ”
11161	11226	11227	11227	Cillian	137	“ At least think about it . Even if it feels weird for you to turn to Sailor and Hunter , that sociopath Cillian would give you the money . Sure , he ’d make you sweat for it — I swear , that asshole is as annoying as his face is sitable — but you ’ll walk out of there with the money . ”
11477	11479	11476	11480	Cillian “ Kill ” Fitzpatrick	137	“ Kill ”
11666	11684	11685	11687	The malnourished PA	198	“ Sorry , sweetie , I do n’t think seeing Mr. Fitzpatrick is in your cards today . ”
11838	11849	11830	11830	she	774	“ Hiiiiiii , Mr. Fitzpatrick . This is Casey Brandt . ”
11852	11863	11864	11864	Pause	201	“ Your assistant for the past two years , sir . ”
11866	11873	11874	11874	She	774	“ Yeah ! With the pink . ”
11877	11895	11874	11874	She	774	“ Totes sorry to bother you , but I have Miss Persephone Penrose here without an appointment . ”
11898	11921	11874	11874	She	774	“ She said she needs to talk to you urgently , but , like , refused to give me any further information ? ”
11966	11993	12008	12008	She	775	“ Yes , I know it is my job to get the information out of her . Unfortunately , she ’s been most uncooperative , sir . ”
11996	12007	12008	12008	She	775	“ Yes , sir . I ’ll let her know . ”
12028	12041	12008	12008	She	775	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick can not seem to fit you in his schedule . ”
12042	12054	12055	12055	My	0	“ Tell him I ’m not leaving until he sees me . ”
12095	12104	12105	12105	She	775	“ Go on , give him my answer . ”
12116	12130	12105	12105	She	775	“ He said he ’s in a meeting that will likely last hours . ”
12131	12140	12105	12105	She	775	“ That ’s okay . I have time . ”
12197	12208	12209	12209	she	775	“ I need to go to the ladies ’ room , ”
12237	12240	12241	12241	I	0	“ Oh ? ”
12245	12282	12283	12283	She	775	“ Are you not fully potty - trained ? You know , I ’m a pre - K teacher . Accidents do n’t faze me in the least . Need help in the big girl toilet ? ”
12290	12308	12309	12309	She	775	“ Do n’t go anywhere , unless it ’s back to the trailer park you came from . ”
12320	12324	12313	12313	her	775	“ Or hell . ”
12500	12551	12485	12485	They	790	“ … stocks going up , but I still noticed a trend in negative press . Saying the media does n’t like you would be an understatement . It ’d be like saying the ocean is damp . That the sun is lukewarm . That Megan Fox is merely shagable … ”
12552	12560	12561	12561	Cillian	137	“ I get the gist of it , ”
12564	12572	12561	12561	Cillian	137	“ How do we rectify the situation ? ”
12573	12586	12587	12588	the man	3888	“ I suppose a personality transplant would be out of the question ? ”
12591	12616	12587	12588	the man	3888	“ The only thing that ’s about to be transplanted is my foot in your ass if you do n’t give me a solution . ”
12630	12636	12637	12639	the posh man	794	“ Bloody hell , Cillian , ”
12642	12672	12637	12639	the posh man	794	“ you started your CEO journey by sacking nine percent of the company ’s management and drilling holes in the Arctic . You have n’t exactly won any fans . ”
12673	12679	12561	12561	Cillian	137	“ I trimmed the fat . ”
12680	12764	12637	12639	the posh man	794	“ People rather like fat . The fast food industry rolls 256 billion dollars in revenue each year . Did you know that ? The people you fired talked to journalists , adding fuel to the fire and making you truly one of the country ’s worst villains . Royal Pipelines is already considered the most hated company in the US . The refinery explosion in Maine , the Green Living climate rally where an eighteen - year - old broke both legs — ”
12765	12776	12777	12777	Cillian	137	“ I was n’t the one who broke her legs , ”
12785	12788	12777	12777	Cillian	137	“ Unfortunately . ”
12789	12824	12825	12826	The man	3888	“ No matter how you spin it , you must clean up your act . Play their game . Promote a wholesome , jolly image . The company ’s reputation needs to be restored . ”
12865	12888	12889	12889	Cillian	137	“ Fine . I ’ll kiss a few babies . Sponsor some students . Donate funds to open a new hospital wing . ”
12908	12927	12896	12896	his	137	“ I ’m afraid we ’re quite past the kissing babies stage . It ’s time , Kill . ”
12934	12955	12928	12928	Cillian	137	“ I will not sacrifice my personal life to pacify a few self - righteous , Tesla - driving pricks — ”
12956	12965	12966	12966	I	0	“ Cillian ? I mean , Mr. Fitzpatrick ? ”
13062	13070	13044	13044	Kill	137	“ I did n’t mean to interrupt — ”
13071	13076	13077	13077	he	137	“ Yet you did , ”
13083	13096	13077	13077	he	137	“ Sorry about that . May I have a word with you ? ”
13097	13100	13101	13101	he	137	“ No , ”
13105	13110	13077	13077	he	137	“ It ’s important . ”
13111	13116	13117	13117	He	137	“ Not to me . ”
13129	13149	13117	13117	He	137	“ Which Penrose sister are you ? The older and loud one , or the young and annoying one ? ”
13213	13218	13219	13219	I	0	“ I ’m Persephone . ”
13257	13265	13247	13247	I	0	“ That does n’t answer my question . ”
13266	13269	13270	13270	I	0	“ Fine , ”
13274	13281	13282	13282	He	137	“ I ’m the annoying one . ”
13298	13304	13284	13284	his	137	“ What do you want ? ”
13305	13315	13284	13284	his	137	“ To speak with you in private , please . ”
13316	13353	13284	13284	his	137	“ Barging into my office unannounced is otiose . Expecting me not to kick you out implies you got your degree at the local Sam ’s Club . Spill it . Mr. Whitehall is my lawyer . ”
13354	13361	13362	13362	I	0	“ Lawyers are people , too , ”
13374	13377	13378	13381	The gorgeous blond man	806	“ Debatable . ”
13385	13389	13390	13390	He	137	“ And actually … ”
13411	13431	13432	13432	He	137	“ I have better things to do than watch you two engaging in verbal foreplay . Cheers , Kill . ”
13475	13481	13482	13482	I	0	“ May I come in ? ”
13585	13602	13603	13603	He	137	“ You have exactly ten , no , make it five minutes before I call security . ”
13611	13625	13603	13603	He	137	“ Give me the elevator pitch , Flower Girl . Make it good . ”
13632	13642	13629	13629	He	137	“ You ’re going to call security on me ? ”
13643	13664	13665	13665	He	137	“ My to - do list is long , and my patience is short . Four and a half minutes . ”
13742	13762	13737	13737	Cillian	137	“ You managed to cram all of this in under three minutes . Maybe you ’re not completely useless . ”
13797	13814	13787	13787	She	200	“ Gosh , I ’m so sorry , Mr. Fitzpatrick . She promised she would n’t … ”
13815	13821	13822	13822	Cillian	137	“ Miss Brandt , leave , ”
13825	13829	13822	13822	Cillian	137	“ But I — ”
13830	13838	13787	13787	She	200	“ Save it for someone who cares . ”
13839	13842	13822	13822	Cillian	137	“ I — ”
13843	13850	13822	13822	Cillian	137	“ That someone is n’t me . ”
13851	13862	13822	13822	Cillian	137	“ Sir , I just wanted you to know that — ”
13863	13905	13906	13906	She	200	“ The only thing I know is you failed at your job and will be assessed accordingly . You ’re leaving in the next three seconds , either through the door or the window . Friendly advice : choose the door . ”
13941	13952	13925	13925	Cillian	137	“ You just threatened to throw Barbie out the window . ”
13960	13967	13968	13968	he	137	“ Not threatened , heavily implied , ”
13971	13987	13968	13968	he	137	“ You have less than two minutes , and I have about five hundred questions . ”
13998	14003	13968	13968	he	137	“ That ’s fair . ”
14004	14031	14036	14036	him	137	“ One — why me ? Why not Hunter , Sailor , or anyone who actually gives half a damn about you , pardon my forwardness ? ”
14085	14180	14078	14078	I	0	“ Sailor and Hunter do n’t know what Paxton did , and they ’re the only people I ’m close with who actually have this kind of money . They know Pax left me and took the money we ’d saved , but they do n’t know about the debt . I do n’t want to taint my friendship with my best friend by putting her in this position . I figured you and I share no history , no ties . With us , it will be a business transaction and nothing more . ”
14181	14187	14188	14188	Sam	209	“ Why not Sam Brennan ? ”
14237	14263	14264	14264	I	0	“ Mixing up with Brennan to try to pay back a street loan shark is like cutting off your arm because you broke your nail , ”
14268	14278	14264	14264	I	0	“ You think I ’m less dangerous than Brennan ? ”
14288	14291	14285	14285	his	824	“ No . ”
14298	14326	14292	14292	I	0	“ But I think you ’d be entertained by watching me squirm as I pay you back , and therefore more likely to give me the money . ”
14348	14358	14343	14343	He	824	“ Where ’s that useless husband of yours now ? ”
14359	14385	14339	14339	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Trust me , if I did , I ’d have chased him to the end of earth and back . ”
14394	14405	14406	14406	Kill	137	“ How are you planning to pay this loan back ? ”
14418	14421	14406	14406	Kill	137	“ Slowly . ”
14430	14469	14406	14406	Kill	137	“ I ’m a pre - K teacher , but I moonlight as a babysitter and tutor first and second graders . I ’ll work tirelessly until I pay you back every penny . You have my word . ”
14470	14498	14540	14540	I	0	“ Your word does n’t mean anything . I do n’t know you . Which brings me to my final question — why should I help you ? ”
14553	14559	14560	14560	He	137	“ Thirty seconds , Persephone . ”
14568	14573	14560	14560	He	137	“ Because you can ? ”
14574	14588	14589	14589	He	137	“ The number of things I can do with my money is infinite . ”
14592	14602	14589	14589	He	137	“ Because it ’s the right thing to do ! ”
14622	14628	14607	14607	He	137	“ I ’m a nihilist . ”
14629	14638	14639	14639	I	0	“ I do n’t know what that means . ”
14650	14667	14668	14668	he	137	“ Right or wrong are the same side of the coin for me , presented differently , ”
14672	14680	14668	14668	he	137	“ I have no morals or principles . ”
14681	14692	14607	14607	He	137	“ That ’s the saddest thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
14693	14696	14697	14697	He	137	“ Really ? ”
14712	14745	14697	14697	He	137	“ The saddest thing I ’ve heard recently is a woman who got screwed over by her no - show husband and was about to get trafficked , murdered , or both . ”
14746	14749	14750	14750	I	0	“ Exactly ! ”
14757	14775	14750	14750	I	0	“ Yes ! See ? If something happens to me , it will be on your conscience . ”
14799	14847	14791	14791	He	137	“ First of all , as I mentioned not two seconds ago , I have no conscience . Second , whatever happens to you is on you and the complete and utter buffoon you married . I ’m not another item on your pile of bad decisions . ”
14848	14862	14791	14791	He	137	“ Marrying Paxton was n’t a bad decision . I married for love . ”
14897	14905	14906	14906	He	137	“ All middle - class girls do . ”
14914	14918	14906	14906	He	137	“ Very uninspiring . ”
14919	14922	14923	14923	I	0	“ Cillian , ”
14927	14934	14923	14923	I	0	“ You ’re my only hope . ”
14987	15090	14978	14978	He	137	“ Here ’s the thing , Persephone . As a matter of principle , I do not give anything away without getting something back . The only thing separating myself and that loan shark who ’s after you is a privileged upbringing and opportunity . I , too , am not in the business of handing out free favors . So unless you tell me what , exactly , I could gain for the one hundred thousand dollars you ’re asking me to kiss goodbye , I ’m going to turn you down . You have ten seconds , by the way . ”
15163	15167	15168	15168	He	137	“ Five seconds . ”
15187	15196	15182	15182	He	137	“ Give me your best offer , Penrose . ”
15256	15273	15274	15274	He	137	“ Have a nice life , Flower Girl . Whatever ’s left of it , anyway . ”
15344	15365	15366	15366	She	200	“ It ’s not every day security takes out the trash . Guess there ’s a first time for everything . ”
15401	15406	15407	15407	Hunter	162	“ We ’re pregnant . ”
15489	15505	15506	15506	I	0	“ Eight weeks in . Still early , but we wanted to let you know . ”
15783	15798	15757	15757	He	212	“ Great job there , sweetheart . Best news we ’ve had all year . ”
15869	15878	15879	15879	Mother	211	“ Are n’t you going to say anything ? ”
15896	15901	15889	15889	I	0	“ To more Fitzpatricks . ”
15902	15911	15912	15912	Athair	212	“ And to the men who make them . ”
16153	16158	16159	16159	I	0	“ Well , Athair , ”
16163	16178	16159	16159	I	0	“ I ’m happy Hunter exceeded your expectations in the heir - producing department . ”
16207	16221	16222	16222	Sailor	158	“ You know , Kill , sarcasm is the lowest form of wit . ”
16238	16262	16263	16263	I	0	“ If you were a selective conversationalist , you would n’t marry a man who thinks fart jokes are the height of comedy , ”
16267	16275	16263	16263	I	0	“ Farts are the height of comedy . ”
16295	16300	16276	16276	Hunter	162	“ It ’s science . ”
16327	16334	16335	16335	Sailor	158	“ Congratulations would have been sufficient . ”
16343	16347	16335	16335	Sailor	158	“ Bite me . ”
16360	16363	16364	16364	Mother	211	“ Dear ! ”
16367	16381	16382	16382	Sailor	158	“ You know there ’s a term for people like you , Kill , ”
16385	16388	16382	16382	Sailor	158	“ Cunts ? ”
16443	16446	16447	16447	Mother	211	“ Language ! ”
16456	16470	16447	16447	Mother	211	“ Yup . I speak at least two fluently — English and profanity . ”
16479	16481	16474	16474	He	162	“ fuck ”
16500	16506	16474	16474	He	162	“ be seein ’ ya , ”

16668	16679	16662	16662	Sailor	158	“ Sociopaths . We call people like your brother sociopaths . ”
16680	16687	16688	16688	Hunter	162	“ That makes so much sense . ”
16693	16703	16688	16688	Hunter	162	“ He really breathes new death into the room . ”
16704	16709	16662	16662	Sailor	158	“ Now , now . ”
16723	16742	16743	16743	She	222	“ We ’re all very excited about the new addition to the family . My very first grandchild . ”

17266	17276	17277	17277	Sailor	158	“ Not before the end of the second trimester , ”
17288	17309	17277	17277	Sailor	158	“ My OB - GYN warned me the first trimester is the rockiest . Plus , it ’s bad luck . ”

17327	17353	17320	17320	Father	225	“ Especially after the Green Living demonstration and the idiot who managed to break both her legs . The press was all over that story . ”
17416	17464	17413	17413	he	212	“ Ceann beag has been the media ’s darling for the past couple of years . Nice , hard - working , approachable . A reformed playboy . Maybe he should be the face of the company for the next few months until the headlines blow over . ”
17538	17566	17567	17567	I	0	“ You want to put my twenty - seven - year - old brother as the head of Royal Pipelines because he managed to impregnate his wife ? ”
17644	17667	17668	17668	Athair	212	“ Look , Cillian , we ’ve been facing a lot of backlash because of the refinery explosion and exploratory Arctic drills , ”
17677	17703	17704	17704	I	0	“ The refinery explosion happened under your watch , and my Arctic exploration rigs will likely up our revenue by five billion dollars by 2030 , ”
17716	17744	17704	17704	I	0	“ In the eight months I ’ve been doing this job , our stock has gone up fourteen percent . Not too shabby for a rookie CEO . ”

17818	17850	17807	17807	he	904	“ The board only cares about the profits , and they ’d vote however I wanted them to vote if it came down to it . Do n’t get too comfortable . ”
17881	17978	18001	18001	My	0	“ You scare your employees , the media loathes you , and to the rest of the public , you ’re a mystery . No family of your own . No partner . No kids . No anchor . Do n’t think I have n’t spoken to Devon . I happen to be of the same mindset as your lawyer . You need someone to dilute your darkness , and you need her fast . Sort this out , Cillian , and do it fast . The press calls you The Villain . Make them stop . ”
17991	18000	17986	17986	I	0	“ Are you done being hysterical , Athair ? ”
18019	18127	18128	18128	He	906	“ I called you mo òrga because I never had to worry about you . You always delivered whatever I needed before I ’d even asked for it . The first perfect eldest Fitzpatrick child in generations since your great - great - great - grandfather made his way from Kilkenny to Boston on a rickety boat . But that has changed . You ’re pushing forty , and it ’s time you settle down . Especially if you want to continue being the face of this company . In case your job is not a strong enough incentive , let me spell it out for you . ”
18138	18195	18196	18196	He	906	“ The next in line for the throne is Hunter , and right now , the person after him is your future niece or nephew . Everything you ’ve worked for will be handed down to them . Everything . And if you fuck this up , I will make sure to dethrone you , too . ”
18254	18260	18244	18244	I	0	“ More food for us . ”

19310	19318	19319	19319	He	967	“ Arrowsmith . What a terrible surprise . ”
19445	19454	19455	19455	He	235	“ Cillian . Thought it might be you . ”
19512	19519	19520	19520	He	235	“ Tough crowd . My family . ”

20409	20424	20402	20402	Andrew	239	“ You know Gerry . He can survive anything short of a nuclear blast . ”
20425	20459	20460	20460	He	235	“ Speaking of soon - to - be dead things , I hear Daddy gave you the keys to Royal Pipelines since he had to step down because of … what was it ? ”

20684	20720	20677	20677	he	235	“ I may or may not have taken the job to settle an old score . The minute I heard you were on the throne , the temptation to behead the king became too much . ”
20730	20782	20721	20721	His	235	“ Killing you and your father financially would be easy . With Gerald weak and out of the loop , and you vulnerable after years of bad press , I am going for your throat , Fitzpatrick . The media darling versus the press villain . Let the best man win . ”
20806	20814	20815	20815	I	0	“ You always were a silly boy , ”
20829	20869	20815	20815	I	0	“ I will strip you of all the things you ’ve managed to achieve since I ’ve last seen you . Take whatever is near and dear to you , and watch you pay . Oh , and Andrew ? ”

21553	21566	21567	21567	He	1027	“ Remember I told you I do n’t hand out free favors ? ”
21583	21590	21576	21576	his	1027	“ Kind of hard to forget . ”
21591	21600	21576	21576	his	1027	“ Well , it ’s your lucky day . ”

21934	22027	21924	21924	his	1027	“ I never let a good crisis go to waste , and yours might be very beneficial for me . You wo n’t have to pay me because your form of compensation will be on the unconventional side . You are going to be my wife . You will marry me , Persephone Penrose . Smile for the cameras for me . Attend charity events on my behalf . And give me children . As many as needed until I have a son . Be it one , three , or six . ”
22028	22031	22032	22032	I	0	“ Anything ! ”

22277	22280	22281	22281	he	137	“ Elaborate , ”
22284	22297	22281	22281	he	137	“ We ca n’t marry . We do n’t love each other . ”
22305	22318	22298	22298	I	0	“ And yes , I know love is so very working class . ”
22319	22323	22324	22324	he	137	“ Middle class , ”
22327	22371	22372	22372	he	137	“ The happy , dumb medium is comfortable enough not to care , and stupid enough not to aim higher . Working and upper classes always take financial matters into consideration . May I remind you the last time you married for love , ”
22382	22430	22372	22372	he	137	“ it ended with a massive debt , a runaway husband , and death threats ? Love is overrated , not to mention fickle . It comes and goes . You ca n’t build a foundation on it . Mutual interests and alliance are a different story . ”
22558	22566	22567	22567	I	0	“ Look , how about a compromise ? ”
22571	22598	22567	22567	I	0	“ I can date you . Be your girlfriend . Hang on your arm and take a good picture . We ’ll have a little arrangement . ”

22620	22660	22661	22661	I	0	“ You ’re offering me a hundred grand to become your live - in escort and bear your children . Plural . If I were a surrogate , I ’d get that same amount of money for one baby , ”

22675	22689	22672	22672	He	137	“ It ’s a long procedure . I do n’t have enough time . ”
22690	22702	22703	22703	He	137	“ You do n’t seem to have enough brain , either . ”
22721	22733	22703	22703	He	137	“ Take my offer . It ’s your only way out . ”

22794	22797	22784	22785	Auntie Tilda	146	“ Look . ”
22808	22817	22798	22798	I	0	“ How about we start dating and I — ”

22834	22842	22843	22843	Cillian	137	“ You do n’t even like me ! ”
22855	22867	22850	22850	his	137	“ What does liking you have to do with marrying you ? ”
22868	22888	22822	22822	he	137	“ Everything ! It has everything to do with it ! How do you expect us to get along ? ”
22889	22894	22895	22895	he	137	“ I do n’t , ”
22899	23004	23005	23005	he	1044	“ You ’ll have your house . I ’ll have mine . You will be stunningly rich , live on Billionaires ’ Row , and become one of New England ’s most envied socialites . You ’ll be far enough away from me to do whatever the hell you ’d like . I am sensible , fair , and realistic . As long as you give me heirs , give me exclusivity throughout our child - producing years , and stay out of tabloids , you should n’t see much of me beyond the first few years of our marriage . But no divorce , ”
23012	23033	23005	23005	he	1044	“ It ’s tacky , bad for business , and shows you ’re a quitter . I ’m no quitter . ”

23101	23117	23089	23089	I	0	“ Because to me it sounds a lot like you ’re trying to buy me . ”
23118	23125	23126	23126	He	1044	“ That ’s because I am . ”
23145	23179	23137	23137	I	0	“ People who vilify money have one thing in common — they do n’t have it . You have a chance to change your fate , Persephone . Do n’t mess it up . ”
23180	23222	23137	23137	I	0	“ Sorry if I sound ungrateful , but your proposition sounds like a very sad existence to me . I want to be loved . To be cherished . To grow old with the man I choose and who chooses me . ”
23292	23366	23286	23286	his	137	“ You can have all those things in time , just not with me . Find yourself a lover . Lead a quiet life with him — provided he signs all the necessary paperwork . You ’ll do you ; I ’ll do me . What I do , in case you have any lingering romantic ideas about us , includes an insatiable amount of high - end escorts and questionable sexual practices . ”
23406	23415	23416	23416	I	0	“ You want me to cheat on you ? ”
23422	23437	23416	23416	I	0	“ After you give me legitimate children , you can do whatever you want . ”

23459	23481	23416	23416	I	0	“ What I need is siring heirs . At least one male . A couple of others for appearance and backup . ”
23533	23565	23566	23566	I	0	“ Why male ? In case you have n’t noticed , this is the twenty - first century . There are women like Irene Rosenfeld , Mary Barra , Corie Barry … ”
23577	23622	23572	23572	He	137	“ Spare me the supermarket list . The truth of the matter is , some things have n’t changed . Women born into obscene privilege — aka my future daughters — rarely opt for hectic careers , which is what running Royal Pipelines demands . ”
23623	23635	23572	23572	He	137	“ That is the most sexist thing I ’ve ever heard . ”
23636	23647	23648	23648	He	137	“ Shockingly , I agree with you on that point . ”
23659	23707	23648	23648	He	137	“ Nonetheless , I ’m not the one making the rules . Traditionally , the firstborn ’s son inherits most of the shares and the role of CEO in Royal Pipelines . That ’s how my father got the gig . That ’s how I got it . ”
23708	23719	23720	23720	He	137	“ What if the kid wants to be something else ? ”

24244	24284	24285	24285	He	137	“ You ’re not going to have a life if you do n’t accept . Forty - eight hours . That ’s my final offer , and it ’s a generous one . You know where to find me . ”
24296	24299	24285	24285	He	137	“ Wait , ”
24389	24417	24380	24380	I	0	“ Give me your home address . I do n’t want to go to your office again . It makes me feel like we ’re conducting business . ”

35801	35808	35809	35809	I	0	“ I ca n’t raise children , ”
35813	35865	35809	35809	I	0	“ You will not be a deadbeat dad . You will take care of them half the time . And I mean really spend time with them . Change diapers , take them to T - ball practices , and reenact their favorite Disney movies . With full - blown costumes . ”
35909	35912	35913	35913	I	0	“ Sure , ”
35916	35925	35913	35913	I	0	“ I ’ll do all of that nonsense . ”
35959	36000	35943	35943	She	174	“ I have other conditions , too . I ’ll be able to keep my job and move around unrestricted . You will not be putting any surveillance or security on me . I want to live a normal life . ”
36001	36014	36015	36016	The girl	1381	“ You wo n’t need to work a day in your life . ”
36026	36029	36015	36016	The girl	1381	“ So ? ”
36068	36078	36079	36079	She	174	“ I do n’t work because I have to . ”
36084	36094	36081	36081	her	174	“ I work because I love what I do . ”
36099	36106	36081	36081	her	174	“ Fine . Keep your job . ”
36107	36112	36081	36081	her	174	“ What about security ? ”
36113	36117	36081	36081	her	174	“ No security . ”
36128	36148	36149	36149	She	174	“ One more thing — as long as other men are off - limits , so are other women . ”
36157	36165	36149	36149	She	174	“ This is not how it works . ”
36206	36220	36197	36197	me	0	“ You ’re the one at my mercy . I make the rules . ”
36221	36225	36226	36226	She	174	“ Am I ? ”
36232	36300	36226	36226	She	174	“ Because , correct me if I ’m wrong , but you seemed to have told me you have another wife lined up , and a nice , long list of potential candidates if she does n’t work out . Yet here you are with me . For a reason I ca n’t fathom , we want each other . Let ’s not pretend otherwise , Kill . ”
36315	36352	36310	36313	All two of them	1389	“ The only reason I prefer you to Minka is because if you die , the women in my life would be upset , and the one thing I dislike more than humans are distressed humans . ”
36353	36367	36368	36368	she	1390	“ I do n’t care what excuse you give yourself for marrying me , ”
36372	36392	36368	36368	she	1390	“ If we get married , we ’ll be equal . At least , you ’ll pretend we are . ”
36418	36425	36412	36412	I	0	“ Let me put this plainly . ”
36430	36444	36426	36426	I	0	“ I ’m not going to stay celibate for months or even weeks . ”
36445	36458	36459	36459	She	1390	“ You wo n’t have to . You ’ll have a wife . ”
36501	36504	36505	36505	I	0	“ No . ”
36514	36519	36505	36505	I	0	“ No , what ? ”
36520	36528	36505	36505	I	0	“ I wo n’t sleep with you . ”
36529	36533	36505	36505	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
36534	36542	36505	36505	I	0	“ Because I do n’t want to . ”
36543	36548	36505	36505	I	0	“ Why ’s that ? ”
36549	36557	36558	36558	I	0	“ Because you do n’t attract me , ”
36630	36654	36655	36655	She	138	“ How , pray tell , do you mean to impregnate me , if you do n’t want to have sex with me ? ”
36665	36687	36655	36655	She	138	“ You are familiar with how babies come to be , right ? Because none of the versions include a cabbage . ”
36698	36716	36717	36717	I	0	“ I know how babies are made , Persephone . That ’s why I bought a stork , ”
36756	36770	36721	36721	She	138	“ I did n’t know you had a sense of humor , Kill . ”
36771	36786	36787	36787	I	0	“ I did n’t know you were so hard - pressed to get laid , ”
36804	36835	36796	36796	Keith	268	“ To answer your question , we ’ll use IVF . You ’ll be knocked up in no time , and we wo n’t have to know each other biblically . ”
36836	36844	36845	36845	She	138	“ What ’s wrong with the Bible ? ”
36849	36853	36845	36845	She	138	“ False advertisement . ”
36858	36864	36854	36854	I	0	“ God does n’t exist . ”
36891	36899	36884	36884	she	138	“ I really ought to hate you . ”
36900	36918	36884	36884	she	138	“ Do n’t bother . Hate is just love with fear and jealousy thrown into the mix . ”
36919	36928	36929	36929	She	138	“ Why me ? Why not my sister ? ”
37004	37034	36991	36991	she	138	“ Because she possesses virtually all of the traits I despise in a person — from being eccentric , entitled , bigmouthed , and opinionated to simply being alive . ”
37035	37042	37046	37046	her	138	“ Yet you always ogle her . ”
37066	37081	37082	37082	I	0	“ I looked at her because I did n’t want to look at you , ”
37085	37096	37082	37082	I	0	“ Why did n’t you want to look at me ? ”
37146	37206	37133	37133	I	0	“ Does it matter why I could n’t look at you ? I ’m looking at you now , and I ’ve come to terms with what I see . Speaking of your sister , she would have taken no longer than five minutes of negotiations and a quickie to convince . Yet you ’re the one I chose . ”
37259	37271	37272	37272	I	0	“ We ’re done here . Email me your ring measurements . ”
37288	37296	37282	37282	She	138	“ Two more conditions before I accept . ”
37364	37367	37359	37359	I	0	“ Shoot . ”
37368	37460	37343	37343	she	138	“ One — I want us to conceive our children the old - fashioned way . I know you think it ’s pitiful and pathetic of me , but I do n’t care . I do n’t want to go through IVF treatments . I do n’t want to take someone else ’s place in my quest for a baby before I tried the natural way . I know I ’m not your taste , but if I come this far for you , it is only fair that you will … ”
37461	37466	37467	37467	I	0	“ Come inside you , ”
37472	37476	37467	37467	I	0	“ Got it . ”
37530	37534	37535	37535	I	0	“ Your funeral , ”
37538	37559	37535	37535	I	0	“ I ’m a notoriously selfish man , in bed and out of it . What ’s the other condition ? ”
37560	37584	37593	37593	she	1403	“ No escorts until I conceive . You ca n’t hop in and out of my bed and still visit your European girlfriends . ”
37585	37588	37636	37636	she	1403	“ No . ”
37589	37592	37593	37593	she	1403	“ Yes , ”
37601	37623	37593	37593	she	1403	“ When you need satisfaction , you will come to me . We ’ll service each other until I fall pregnant . ”
37757	37779	37750	37751	Colin Byrne	179	“ You drive a hard bargain . Welcome to the dark side , Persephone . Leave your heart at the door . ”
37845	37849	37850	37850	I	0	“ Mr. Whitehall ? ”
37908	37918	37895	37895	She	1410	“ And who is this foam - born Aphrodite ? ”
37919	37946	37947	37947	Devon	215	“ That would be my sister , Mr. Zeus . Now if you ’d be as kind as to peel your creepy eyes off her legs … ”
38001	38110	37990	37990	Devon	215	“ I filled out most of it . Sign where indicated with arrow flags and your initials on the bottom of each page . Go through your spouse ’s details one more time and ensure all the information is correct . There ’s a list of outstanding documentation I ’ll need you to hand over before the marriage can be resolved . It ’s on the last page . Get it to me by tomorrow morning . It ’ll take the court two business days to process the application , in which you agree not to claim any of your and Mr. Veitch ’s mutual funds or possessions . ”
38111	38120	37990	37990	Devon	215	“ We have no mutual funds or possessions . ”
38121	38124	38128	38128	he	215	“ Precisely . ”
38208	38217	38191	38191	I	0	“ Thank you , Devon . That ’s — ”
38218	38231	38232	38232	He	215	“ Bugger , do n’t thank me , you silly little thing . ”
38243	38319	38320	38320	He	215	“ I did n’t do this out of the goodness of my heart . I did it because your future husband needs a baby - maker , preferably the kind that would bring positive press to his doorstep . Which is why you will also find in this load of legal documents a nondisclosure agreement and a prenup , both of which I advise you to read carefully in the company of a proper solicitor . ”
38335	38385	38320	38320	He	215	“ Here ’s some cash in case you ca n’t afford one . Consider this my wedding gift to you . There ’s a sheet of dos and don’ts attached , some stipulations you verbally agreed to yesterday . No house - sharing , a non - compete clause … ”
38386	38391	38392	38392	I	0	“ Non - compete ? ”
38395	38408	38392	38392	I	0	“ I ’m not planning to open a petroleum company anytime soon . ”
38427	38455	38424	38424	Devon	215	“ Having access to the Fitzpatrick clan means you can spy for the competitors or decide to work for someone who ’d pose a conflict of interest . ”
38456	38463	38470	38470	He	215	“ I ’d never do that . ”
38464	38469	38470	38470	He	215	“ Clearly , darling . ”
38493	38542	38470	38470	He	215	“ We trust you completely . And by ‘ completely ’ I mean , about eighty - three percent . The other seventeen is why we prefer to have it in writing . You ’ll have to mortgage your inner organs if your never turns into a maybe . ”
38543	38551	38552	38552	I	0	“ How do you live with yourself ? ”
38603	38626	38595	38595	his	215	“ Considering your face was smashed by mobsters , I would n’t judge your future husband for wanting to protect his assets . ”
38640	38645	38646	38646	I	0	“ Do you mind ? ”
38672	38681	38663	38663	I	0	“ My sister does n’t know what happened . ”
38682	38687	38688	38688	He	215	“ Is she blind ? ”
38702	38709	38688	38688	He	215	“ She thinks I got robbed . ”
38710	38727	38693	38693	his	215	“ No offense , but you do n’t look like the type to carry extra cash . ”
38731	38744	38693	38693	his	215	“ Or coins . Or food stamps . You ’re dreadfully gaunt . ”
38836	38849	38831	38831	I	0	“ Look , can I have my future husband ’s phone number ? ”
38866	38874	38875	38875	I	0	“ How do you know my code ? ”
38878	38908	38875	38875	I	0	“ Had to write down your birthdate six hundred times when I filled in the paperwork last night . You seem like the predictable sort . Again , no — ”
38909	38915	38916	38916	His	215	“ Offense . I know . ”
38931	38946	38916	38916	His	215	“ You realize prefacing something with these words makes it automatically offensive , right ? ”
38947	38967	38875	38875	I	0	“ The code to get to him is six six six . He only responds to texts . Sporadically . ”
38983	38988	38970	38970	Devon	215	“ Cheers , Persephone . ”
38989	38992	38993	38993	I	0	“ Wait ! ”
38997	39016	39017	39017	He	215	“ What about Colin Byrne ? Can I tell him I ’ll have the money ready for him ? ”
39023	39036	39037	39037	He	215	“ Ah , that ’s the best part of becoming a Fitzpatrick . ”
39042	39094	39039	39039	his	215	“ Your problems are no longer yours . I do believe Colin is Sam Brennan ’s jurisdiction . To that end , I ’d say you ’re all covered , and that Byrne is thoroughly and royally fucked for laying a hand on you . Welcome to the family , Persy . ”
39095	39106	39107	39107	Sailor	158	“ What do you mean you ’re breaking the pact ? ”
39270	39278	39279	39279	Ash	160	“ She is not breaking the pact . ”
39291	39307	39279	39279	Ash	160	“ She ’s still married to Paxton . She ca n’t we d anyone else . ”
39335	39342	39343	39343	I	0	“ I am breaking the pact . ”
39361	39380	39343	39343	I	0	“ I ’m getting married to Cillian . He is working on my divorce certificate as we speak . ”
39381	39386	39389	39389	Emmabelle	153	“ Cillian - Cillian ? ”
39402	39431	39432	39432	My	0	“ Tall , dark , broody . Two little red horns peeking from either side of his head ? Possibly a tail tucked between those steel ass cheeks ? ”
39447	39452	39453	39453	Ash	160	“ My brother Cillian ? ”
39456	39459	39453	39453	Ash	160	“ Yes . ”
39474	39480	39460	39460	I	0	“ One and the same . ”
39481	39484	39485	39485	Sailor	158	“ Why ? ”
39488	39491	39492	39492	Belle	148	“ How ? ”
39495	39501	39492	39492	Belle	148	“ Is he threatening you ? ”
39505	39525	39526	39526	Sailor	158	“ Look , if it ’s about money , Hunter and I would be more than happy to help . ”
39547	39573	39543	39543	she	158	“ Me too . I would n’t be able to live with myself if I knew you only married my brother because you were struggling . ”
39632	39643	39644	39644	Sailor	158	“ Of course she does n’t want to marry him . ”
39652	39676	39644	39644	Sailor	158	“ It ’s Kill Fitzpatrick we ’re talking about . He has n’t exactly won any Mr. Personality awards in the last decade . ”
39677	39692	39693	39693	Aisling	160	“ Love changes people . You and my brother are prime examples of that , ”
39702	39731	39697	39697	Sailor	158	“ Hunter has always been good and lost . Cillian is bad and knows exactly where and what he is . A wolf can never be a pet . ”
39812	39815	39816	39816	I	0	“ Look . ”
39819	39857	39816	39816	I	0	“ Thanks for the offers , but I ’m good . I ’m marrying him because I want to . I know it ’s sudden , but Kill and I have gotten close in the past few — ”
39858	39866	39867	39867	Belle	148	“ You better not finish this sentence , ”
39877	39913	39867	39867	Belle	148	“ You ’re already breaking the pact . At least have the decency not to lie to us . You and Kill do n’t know each other beyond you being his baby sister ’s friend . ”
39914	39931	39932	39932	Sailor	158	“ If Cillian asked you to marry him , it ’s for all the wrong reasons . ”
39943	39966	39937	39937	she	158	“ Did he tell you he does n’t have any feelings ? Like , at all ? He takes pride in that . ”
39983	40002	39980	39980	I	0	“ I know who Kill is . We ’ve been running in the same circles for years now . ”
40003	40010	40011	40011	Sailor	158	“ Kill does n’t run anywhere . ”
40014	40056	40057	40057	She	158	“ He swaggers with a cocky grin and fucks shit up . Just tell me what kind of money you need , and I ’ll get you out of this . Forget about a loan . Do n’t pay me back . ”
40090	40105	40079	40079	She	158	“ For my part , I ’ll ask Athair for a good divorce lawyer , ”
40111	40135	40079	40079	She	158	“ This is totally fixable . It ’s not too late to say no . We can make sure you ’ll still get — ”
40136	40142	40143	40143	I	0	“ You want the truth ? ”
40156	40252	40143	40143	I	0	“ Fine , here ’s the truth — I’m not like you guys . Belle is a street - smart , man - eating lady boss who is out to conquer the world and build an empire . Aisling , you were born into royalty . You have more money than some countries , two brothers who would kill for you , and a promising career as a doctor . Sail , you already met your Prince Charming , and you have a father and brother who ’d get you out of anything . Me … ”
40261	40374	40253	40253	I	0	“ I ’m different . I wanted to marry for love . And I did . Saying it did n’t work out would be the understatement of the century . Now it ’s time to marry for comfort . It is not the noble or honorable thing to do . Trust me , I ’m well aware of that . But it ’s my choice . I choose security . I choose stability . I know he is not going to love me , but he will take care of me , and that ’s something Paxton failed to do . If I can live with it , then so can you . ”
40392	40399	40400	40400	I	0	“ I ’m breaking the pact , ”
40424	40435	40440	40440	Sailor	158	“ And there ’s nothing you can do about it . ”
40535	40545	40546	40546	I	0	“ Listen , I have options . I do . ”
40553	40603	40604	40604	I	0	“ I choose to be with Cillian . He may not give me love , but he ’ll give me everything else I ’m looking for . I ’ll be able to start the family I ’ve always wanted , have kids . A place to call my own … ”
40608	40637	40604	40604	I	0	“ All I ’m asking is for you to support this . It ’s crazy , and insane , and unconventional , but it is still my choice . ”
40679	40712	40668	40668	her	148	“ Welp . If you excuse me , I have to go scream at my sister , have a mental breakdown , then accept her decision . See you later , ladies . ”
40810	40819	40804	40804	I	0	“ How come you did n’t freak out ? ”
40842	40852	40835	40835	Belle	148	“ Sorry , were you expecting a whole production ? ”
40853	40862	40863	40863	She	148	“ Expected ? No . Predicted ? Yes . ”
40866	40919	40863	40863	She	148	“ I ’m not Willy Wonka . I do n’t sugarcoat stuff , sis . You know how I feel about Kill Fitzpatrick , but you ’re not a baby anymore . You can make your own decisions , even if I think those decisions should land you in a psychiatric ward . ”
40920	40933	40835	40835	Belle	148	“ That never stopped you from being super protective of me before . ”
41052	41138	41139	41139	She	148	“ I ’ll always have your back . But honestly ? I ’m half - sold on the idea . Paxton left you penniless and heartbroken . I watched you suffer through the past eight months , trying to hold your head up . If you want to switch tactics and marry a wealthy man who will provide for you , I ’ll be the last one to judge you for it . Ultimately , we all make choices to the best of our abilities . ”
41148	41155	41139	41139	She	148	“ There ’s also something else . ”
41170	41209	41210	41210	she	148	“ I know you ’ve never said anything , but I always kind of knew you had a thing for Kill . It was in your eyes when he entered a room . They changed . They glittered , ”
41213	41243	41210	41210	she	148	“ It ’s never too late to change the name of the prince in your story . Just as long as you do n’t end up with the villain . ”
41244	41252	41253	41253	I	0	“ He ca n’t be the villain . ”
41258	41265	41253	41253	I	0	“ He ’s already saved me . ”
41266	41274	41275	41275	she	148	“ You know he ca n’t love ? ”
41279	41289	41275	41275	she	148	“ Love is a luxury not everyone can afford . ”
41290	41305	41306	41306	She	148	“ Well , if anyone can move mountains , it ’s you , sis . ”
41459	41472	41473	41473	Belle	148	“ You ’re not the naïve little damsel everyone thinks you are . ”
41488	41553	41473	41473	Belle	148	“ You have nails and teeth , and a spine to go with them . Persephone was n’t only a floral maiden . She was also the queen of death . Your groom ’s in for a rude awakening . But know this — if Kill ever tries to play Hades , I ’d descend to the underworld myself to rip his balls off . ”
41554	41558	41559	41559	Byrne	179	“ All there ? ”
41594	41598	41599	41599	Sam	209	“ Count it , ”
41676	41679	41680	41680	Byrne	179	“ Kam . ”
41715	41726	41701	41701	Byrne	179	“ Count with me , you useless sack of meat . ”
41753	41775	41776	41776	Sam	209	“ I ’m pleased to say we have no outstanding debts between us , gentlemen . Thank you for your business . ”

41825	41835	41822	41822	Brennan	209	“ we do have one outstanding matter to resolve . ”
41844	41850	41851	41851	Byrne	179	“ What would that be ? ”

41879	41888	41889	41889	Sam	209	“ Can I tell you a little secret ? ”
41920	41973	41898	41898	he	209	“ I ’ve always had a weakness for numbers . Do n’t know what it is about them , Byrne , but they calm me down . They make sense . My son of a bitch sperm donor was good at nothing but numbers . Guess I got the knack from him . ”
41974	41977	41978	41978	Byrne	179	“ Please , ”
41987	42010	41978	41978	Byrne	179	“ I already told you , I did n’t know she was under your protection . I had no idea , man — ”
42011	42040	42041	42041	Sam	209	“ Stop begging , unless you want me to cut you a nice smile to remind you how cheerful you were when you paid her your weekly visits . ”
42058	42121	42041	42041	Sam	209	“ Now , here ’s what this math enthusiast wants to know . Why would a loan shark inflate his interest by two hundred percent when the market standard is fifty ? Is it possible you took advantage of the lovely creature Paxton Veitch had left behind and decided to whore her out , knowing she could make you a fast buck ? ”
42230	42246	42247	42247	Byrne	179	“ Veitch wanted to whore out his wife all by himself before he fucked off ! ”
42259	42314	42315	42315	Sam	209	“ He wanted to kidnap her and give her to me . I told him not to bother . That I did n’t want the FBI on my tail . Human trafficking will get you a shit - ton of jail time . I even gave the bitch extra time to pay me back . ”
42325	42334	42319	42319	his	209	“ Are you thinking what I ’m thinking ? ”

42549	42554	42555	42555	Byrne	179	“ It was Kaminski ! ”
42561	42590	42555	42555	Byrne	179	“ He did it ! I told him to threaten her , maybe slap her around , but no more . He was the one who hurt her ! ”
42591	42600	42601	42601	I	0	“ Where ’d you hurt her , Kaminski ? ”

42941	42987	42988	42988	I	0	“ If I hear you so much as breathed in her direction , there will be hell to pay . In fact , I ’ll be checking in to see you keep your distance from her . If I find you in her zip code … ”

43269	43273	43254	43254	Sam	209	“ What about ? ”
43274	43277	43254	43254	Sam	209	“ Marriage . ”
43278	43282	43254	43254	Sam	209	“ More specifically ? ”
43283	43296	43297	43297	Sam	209	“ The inconvenient necessity of it . What are you waiting for ? ”
43325	43328	43313	43313	He	209	“ Nothing . ”
43354	43421	43351	43351	he	209	“ I have no plans to get married . It ’s a surprisingly easy decision to make when you have no duty to continue a lineage and your biological parents are a back - stabbing asshole who deserved to die and a whore who left you on her ex - boyfriend ’s doorstep when you were old enough to know what it meant to be abandoned . ”
43422	43430	43431	43431	I	0	“ Who ’ll inherit everything you own ? ”
43483	43497	43480	43480	Sam	209	“ Sailor . Her kids , maybe . Money means nothing to me . ”
43502	43513	43514	43514	I	0	“ But you grew up with Troy and Sparrow Brennan , ”

43564	43624	43625	43625	He	209	“ But that means jack - shit . I have neither Sparrow ’s DNA nor Troy ’s . I ’m an orphan . An elaborated mistake born from vengeance . I have no plans of reproducing . Besides , what good would it be to have a child , knowing I could get locked up for life any day ? ”
43630	43631	43633	43633	his	3888	“ Now”—he
43637	43697	43625	43625	He	209	direction—“back to business . Byrne and his puppet are out of the picture for good . The next step is to find Veitch . See where he ’s hiding . What he ’s doing . Put him on a leash . Maybe bring him back and throw him into Byrne ’s claws . Kill two birds with one stone . ”
43698	43702	43703	43703	I	0	“ Leave him . ”
43708	43731	43703	43703	I	0	“ Byrne is paid . Kaminski will be in a wheelchair for life . Veitch is probably dead . It ’s done . ”
43732	43771	43625	43625	He	209	“ Dead ? I do n’t think so . I bet you Veitch is alive , and that as soon as he hears his wife got hitched to a billionaire , he ’ll be back , making demands . ”
43772	43776	43777	43777	I	0	“ Not possible , ”
43780	43814	43777	43777	I	0	“ The divorce certificate should arrive tomorrow morning . He would n’t be eligible for a penny . I do n’t need to know where Veitch is or what he ’s up to . ”

43885	43900	43877	43877	I	0	“ Precisely . Better knock her up before she runs off with her ex . ”

49248	49282	49245	49245	I	0	“ So you do n’t consume products that are loosely connected to racism . By that logic , you do n’t drive a Ford , wear Hugo Boss , or use Kodak products . ”

51352	51376	51377	51377	I	0	“ Make him lose his pants by prolonging the trial until Green Living wo n’t be able to afford a package of lettuce , ”

52764	52799	52800	52800	I	0	“ A bit of loyalty would n’t kill you , Flower Girl . I ’m your husband . Although that ’s not saying much , considering you divorced the previous one without his consent . ”
52818	52838	52814	52814	Her	3978	“ Are you kidding me ? You ’re comparing my divorcing my runaway husband to what you ’re doing ? ”
52865	52905	52814	52814	Her	3978	“ You ’re ruining our planet for financial gain . The Earth is not your wasteland . Not to mention , you ’re driving entire animal groups into extinction . The polar bears and the penguins come to mind . ”

55941	55944	56005	56005	he	515	“ Why ? ”
55945	56002	56005	56005	he	515	“ Because it ’s the right thing to do . And because there is absolutely zero chance of my forming any attachment to them or vice versa . It is not too late for IVF , Persephone . Do the right thing and leave the dirty fucks for the mistresses . You ’re better than that . ”
56154	56157	56148	56148	he	515	“ Fine . ”
56168	56172	56173	56173	He	515	“ You win . ”

If you do n’t get out of here in the next five minutes , I ’ll assume you want to see your husband ’s true colors and get fucked in front of my friends on the poker table , slowly and all evening , while they watch . ”
58353	58365	58366	58366	He	137	“ You think you escaped a bad relationship by marrying me . ”
58373	58398	58366	58366	He	137	“ You have no idea , Flower Girl . I pay them because fucking me is not a pleasure , it ’s a job . Now”—he

60386	60390	60391	60391	Sam	209	“ And shit , ”
60395	60399	60391	60391	Sam	209	“ And yourself . ”
60421	60431	60432	60432	Hunter	162	“ Dev , can you check Kill ’s temperature ? ”
60440	60462	60432	60432	Hunter	162	“ He just missed a chance to slag me off , as your people call it . It ’s unlike him . ”
60463	60486	60487	60487	Devon	291	“ Very few things would make me touch your twat of a brother , and you are definitely not on the list , ”
60571	60602	60564	60564	He	871	“ In my defense , you should n’t have trusted me . I ca n’t stay celibate for an afternoon , let alone an entire weekend . Everyone knows that . ”
60843	60849	60850	60850	She	3978	“ What ’s his name ? ”

60944	60957	60958	60958	I	0	“ Congratulations , you just passed a third - grade history exam . ”
60972	60975	60976	60976	she	3978	“ Fifth , ”

61021	61051	61017	61017	she	3978	“ Unlike our children , who will be staying right next to us until they are old enough to make up their minds about where they want to study . ”
61064	61072	61073	61073	I	0	“ Over your dead body , huh ? ”
61085	61088	61089	61089	she	3978	“ No , ”

61127	61151	61123	61124	my wife	3978	“ They ’re beautiful , but some of them seem quite old . Gray - faced . Do you ride all of them ? ”
61152	61162	61163	61163	I	0	“ Yes . They ’re all in pristine condition . ”
61180	61202	61203	61203	She	3978	“ My father gifted me a horse for every year I finished top of my class , starting in middle school . ”
61209	61219	61203	61203	She	3978	“ Is n’t being perfect all the time tiring ? ”
61238	61246	61232	61232	I	0	“ What kind of question is that ? ”
61247	61256	61276	61276	her	3978	“ One I ’d like an answer to . ”
61257	61263	61276	61276	her	3978	“ Is being average boring ? ”
61264	61267	61268	61268	she	3978	“ No , ”
61279	61339	61268	61268	she	3978	“ Then again , I do n’t think I ’m boring at all . I think I ’m exactly who I was supposed to grow up to be , flaws and all . My parents always encouraged me to pursue my dream , and my dream was to raise children . Other people ’s as well as my own . ”
61340	61423	61276	61276	her	3978	“ Well , I enjoyed the opposite treatment . Everything about my arrival in this world was carefully planned . I came first , and I was male , which meant the expectations from me were complete and utter perfection in all aspects of my life . I knew I was going to carry the Fitzpatrick bloodline , take over Royal Pipelines , continue the lineage . My existence has always had a purpose , and nothing short of excellence will do . ”
61424	61432	61487	61487	She	1931	“ You ’re not perfect with me . ”
61433	61444	61445	61445	I	0	“ What you witnessed last week was lack of discretion . ”
61450	61456	61445	61445	I	0	“ It was n’t pretty . ”
61457	61475	61487	61487	She	1931	“ No . But we ’re all ugly in certain parts , and I ’m still here . ”
61482	61486	61487	61487	She	1931	“ Come inside . ”
61520	61525	61526	61526	I	0	“ Food ’s ready . ”
61535	61539	61526	61526	I	0	“ Not hungry . ”

61550	61555	61526	61526	I	0	“ The master bedroom . ”
61556	61565	61526	61526	I	0	“ Where am I going to sleep tonight ? ”
61566	61585	61526	61526	I	0	“ Any of the six guest rooms . I own this place , so you get first choice . ”
61586	61592	61593	61593	she	1931	“ I choose your bedroom , ”
61600	61608	61609	61609	I	0	“ First choice other than my bed , ”
61612	61618	61619	61619	she	1931	“ Our friends will talk , ”
61622	61649	61650	61650	I	0	“ They have the irritating tendency to do that . Everyone knows ours is a sham marriage . No one ’s going to buy your charade . ”
61742	61750	61751	61751	She	1931	“ I made a mistake coming here . ”
61826	61842	61843	61843	My	0	“ You did . I will only have you on my terms , Flower Girl . ”
61852	61862	61863	61863	I	0	“ That was n’t a part of our contract . ”
61884	61888	61878	61878	I	0	“ Sue me . ”
61889	61902	61903	61903	Devon	291	“ The lawsuit is airtight . I read through it several times . ”
61955	61989	61943	61943	I	0	“ I ’ve spent an unholy amount on money on the Arctic offshore development . I ’m not canning this project because Arrowsmith has a hard - on to see me go bankrupt . ”
61990	61997	61998	61998	Hunter	162	“ We wo n’t go bankrupt , ”
62036	62082	62012	62012	My	0	“ I looked at the numbers . Stopping the drilling in the Arctic is going to hurt our pocket , but we can take the blow . The capital growth will stop for the next four years , but we will still be making money . ”
62083	62101	62102	62102	I	0	“ I ’m not here to make money . I ’m here to take over the world . ”
62108	62116	62117	62117	Devon	291	“ You might not have a choice , ”
62120	62182	62117	62117	Devon	291	“ If you lose the lawsuit , you ’d have to stop anyway . And have plenty of legal bills to pay , another PR disaster on your hands , and a father who ’d kick you out of the CEO position , turn the board against you , and appoint Hunter to run the show . No offense , Hunt . ”
62183	62187	62188	62188	Hunter	162	“ None taken . ”
62191	62213	62214	62214	He	162	“ I do n’t want to be CEO . You know what this kind of pressure can do to my skin ? ”
62222	62242	62216	62216	his	162	“ We can always think outside the box . And by that , I mean put Arrowsmith in one . ”
62276	62300	62301	62301	He	162	“ I ’ve a feeling I do n’t want to be here for this conversation . Allow me to excuse myself , gentlemen . ”
62329	62368	62310	62310	Sam	209	“ Regretfully , you ca n’t kill Arrowsmith . The blowback would be huge , all arrows would point at me , and the media would have a field day . Not to mention , Arrowsmith has children . ”
62369	62382	62383	62383	Sam	209	“ When did you grow a conscience and start caring about children ? ”
62386	62410	62383	62383	Sam	209	“ You have n’t met the little devils . If something happens to their parents , no one would want to adopt them . ”
62411	62426	62310	62310	Sam	209	“ Fine . He can live . I can still throw my weight around . ”
62427	62436	62437	62437	I	0	“ Physical extortion wo n’t get you far . ”
62445	62474	62437	62437	I	0	“ He ’s got something on me , and I ’m waiting to see how he ’s going to use it . We need to play this carefully . ”

62488	62506	62507	62507	I	0	“ You ’re disgustingly perfect . Dad ’s fucking mo òrga . What could it possibly be ? ”
62510	62525	62507	62507	I	0	“ We have to keep it clean . Let ’s leave it at that . ”
62526	62542	62543	62543	Sam	209	“ In that case , I ’m with Whitehall on trying to squash that beef , ”
62553	62590	62547	62547	his	209	“ He is going ahead with the lawsuit . You can get him in a few months when things calm down . In the meantime , your best shot is finding common ground with Green Living . ”

62604	62610	62611	62611	Sam	209	“ Retreating is not submitting . ”
62614	62657	62611	62611	Sam	209	“ If Kill wants to win this thing , he has to play it smart . This is round one out of many . History does n’t remember the battle . Only the name of the man who threw the final knockout . ”
62876	62886	62866	62866	she	148	“ But you do n’t know how to ride . ”
62912	62938	62939	62939	She	148	“ So ? You can teach me . Besides , I ’ve done my fair share of riding in my life , just not bareback . ”
62942	62946	62939	62939	She	148	“ Safety first . ”
62947	62953	62954	62954	Sailor	158	“ Thanks for ruining breakfast . ”
62963	62976	62954	62954	Sailor	158	“ Seriously , though , who goes to a ranch without riding ? ”
62986	62998	62999	62999	Ash	160	“ Cillian wo n’t like it if we use his horses , ”
63002	63009	63010	63010	I	0	“ Cillian does n’t like anything , ”
63025	63073	63018	63018	Sailor	158	“ Preach . I actually think it ’s a great idea . Not only because it would piss off Persy ’s husband , but also because an opportunity to ride horses like Cillian ’s does n’t come often . Each of them costs like 300k or something . Unfortunately”—she
63077	63104	63018	63018	Sailor	158	belly—“riding is off the table for me . But I ’ll cheer you on with a bag of Cheetos in hand . Live vicariously through you . ”
63136	63148	63149	63149	I	0	“ Actually , I agree . I think we should ride , ”
63152	63155	63149	63149	I	0	“ Really ? ”
63213	63217	63218	63218	Ash	160	“ But Cillian — ”

63251	63256	63257	63257	Aisling	160	“ Well , then . ”
63263	63277	63259	63259	her	160	“ Let ’s get changed and meet at the stables in an hour . ”

63758	63798	63731	63731	He	162	“ Ash is good , but she ’s not a professional . If I bring you back with as much as a scratch , your husband will make me bleed from places that are n’t even on my body . ”
63799	63804	63805	63805	Aisling	160	“ He is right . ”
63809	63820	63805	63805	Aisling	160	“ Both about my horseback riding abilities and about Kill . ”

63893	63899	63885	63885	Sam	209	“ So dramatic , Penrose . ”
63900	63906	63878	63878	Belle	148	“ So chauvinistic , Brennan . ”

64444	64473	64474	64474	Kill	137	“ The country is free , but the horses are not . Hamilton belongs to me , and I do n’t want you riding him . Ceann beag . ”
64483	64491	64474	64474	Kill	137	“ Beat it before I beat you . ”
64492	64571	64572	64572	Hunter	162	“ Sorry , doll . There ’s a reason he has a demon in his garden fountain and not a cherub or a fawn . You married Satan , and I do n’t want the fucker to assign me a room in hell . He ’ll probably put me in the same cul - de - sac with Hitler and the dude who invented berry - flavored La Croix . I deserve better neighbors . Just following orders . ”
64686	64695	64696	64696	he	162	“ I ’m getting you off this horse , ”
64704	64727	64696	64696	he	162	“ Why do n’t we start with you just getting me off ? You seem to be having trouble in that department , ”
64732	64760	64728	64728	I	0	“ The first and last time I touched you , you came so hard I was worried my dick would have to be removed from you surgically . ”
64761	64766	64728	64728	I	0	“ That was accidental . ”
64780	64789	64728	64728	I	0	“ So was my giving you an orgasm . ”
64790	64803	64804	64804	I	0	“ You really want me to hate you , do n’t you ? ”
64831	64837	64838	64838	he	1993	“ Sailor is not riding , ”
64842	64847	64838	64838	he	1993	“ Sailor is pregnant . ”
64848	64861	64862	64862	His	1993	“ As far as we know , you could be , too . ”
64910	64924	64903	64903	I	0	“ If I am pregnant , it ’s at a very early stage . ”
64925	64934	64972	64972	him	1993	“ All the more reason to be careful . ”
64935	64962	64963	64963	My	0	“ Oh , for fuck ’s sake , Kill . Do n’t give me this bullshit as though you actually care about my well - being . ”
64998	65003	64987	64987	he	1993	“ Do not curse . ”

65026	65048	65019	65019	My	0	“ What ’re you gon na do about it ? You ’re already the worst possible husband a woman could have . ”
65089	65138	65139	65139	My	0	“ By the way , are we going to have sex once a month and pray I get knocked up ? How ’re we going to do this thing ? Please let me know because I ’m starting to realize you have n’t thought your genius plan through ! ”
65171	65176	65139	65139	My	0	“ … my sister ! ”
65177	65184	65139	65139	My	0	“ … can hold her own . ”

65197	65218	65219	65220	Our friends	1518	“ She ’ll hurt him back . You said it yourself , Belle . She ’s not a kid anymore . ”
65256	65263	65264	65264	Cillian	137	“ You ’re being a brat , ”
65272	65279	65264	65264	Cillian	137	“ You ’re being a coward . ”
65305	65344	65297	65297	I	0	“ Seriously , if you ’re going to ignore me for the rest of our lives , just grant me a divorce . I ’ll pay you back the money , and we ’ll forget this ever happened . ”
65345	65348	65349	65349	His	321	“ Never . ”
65356	65378	65349	65349	His	321	“ I ’ll give you a lot of things , Flower Girl , but divorce wo n’t be one of them . ”
65379	65407	65349	65349	His	321	“ That so ? I ’ll tell Sailor , Belle , and Hunter . I ’m sure they ’d love to know what you roped me into . ”
65408	65412	65413	65413	He	321	“ Go ahead . ”
65429	65450	65413	65413	He	321	“ See how much power other people have on me . You ’ll find the exact amount is absolutely none . ”
65451	65478	65479	65479	His	321	“ So you wo n’t have me , but you wo n’t let me go . Do you just want me to be miserable like you ? ”
65511	65516	65504	65504	He	321	“ I hate you , ”
65897	65907	65908	65908	I	0	“ Oh God , oh God , oh God , ”

66168	66174	66175	66175	he	137	“ You ’re not hurt , ”
66181	66185	66175	66175	he	137	“ I checked . ”
66186	66191	66192	66192	My	0	“ But you are . ”
66197	66209	66210	66210	He	137	“ I ’ll survive , much to some people ’s dismay . ”
66241	66255	66233	66233	His	137	“ Shhh . It was just a little scare . You ’re fine . ”
66256	66268	66269	66269	I	0	“ That ’s not the point ! You ’re not fine ! ”
66307	66330	66294	66294	He	137	“ I - I do n’t even know what I did wrong . Ash said Hamilton is your best horse for rookies . ”
66378	66450	66366	66366	Franklin	331	“ You did n’t do anything wrong . Hamilton has had a bad couple of years . He had swelling in his rear legs and did n’t get much riding time . When winter hit , he was down for the count . I knew I needed to re - break him come spring . He was n’t ready for riding . When I saw you on him without a helmet … ”
66466	66487	66460	66460	he	137	“ I ’m going to dismember Hunter and feed him to the polar bears he is so desperate to save . ”
66488	66499	66500	66500	I	0	“ Hunter does n’t like the Arctic drilling , either ? ”
66505	66510	66511	66511	he	137	“ Do n’t start , ”
66514	66528	66511	66511	he	137	“ Fine . But you should know it was my idea to ride . ”
66569	66594	66549	66549	He	137	“ Hunter screwed this up . He did n’t give Hamilton enough time to get acquainted with you . Smell you . Feel you . ”
66595	66605	66606	66606	My	0	“ He was by my side the entire time . ”
66619	66633	66612	66612	I	0	“ It ’s not his fault . It ’s no one ’s fault . ”
66710	66715	66716	66716	I	0	“ You saved me , ”
66720	66723	66716	66716	I	0	“ Again . ”
66763	66769	66770	66770	He	137	“ You ’re my wife . ”
66781	66790	66791	66791	I	0	“ You do n’t act like I am , ”
66794	66802	66791	66791	I	0	“ We ’re not a normal couple . ”
66803	66806	66807	66807	he	137	“ No , ”

66841	66846	66833	66833	I	0	“ Where ’s Hamilton ? ”
66847	66882	66883	66883	He	137	“ A question of the ages . I ’ll give you a ride home , then go look for him . You stay with Sailor and try to stay alive while I ’m gone . ”
66958	66964	66965	66965	Sailor	158	“ You look like shit . ”
66970	66980	66981	66981	Kill	137	“ You are n’t exactly my type , either , ”
66997	67027	67028	67028	He	515	“ Make yourself useful and draw her a bath . Do n’t let her out of your sight . She ’s easy to forget and hard to keep alive . ”
67058	67066	67045	67045	Sailor	158	“ Nothing about this situation is funny . ”
67084	67087	67088	67088	She	158	“ Oh . ”
67101	67108	67088	67088	She	158	“ But of course it is . ”
67109	67114	67088	67088	She	158	“ Please enlighten me . ”
67115	67125	67126	67126	Sailor	158	“ You made your husband shit bricks , dude . ”
67142	67196	67126	67126	Sailor	158	“ You should ’ve seen the asshole when I told him you guys went riding . He looked ready to smash some skulls . Someone ’s got it bad for you . Kill and Persy are sitting in a tree . F - U - C - K - I - N - G. ”
67280	67288	67274	67278	my banged - up husband	2013	“ Cowboy Cunt - sa - nova , ”
67315	67341	67342	67342	Belle	148	“ Let me tell you , I think cowboys are libido repellents , but somehow , watching Kill riding an unruly stallion changed my mind . ”
67355	67368	67350	67350	I	0	“ Watch it . It ’s my husband you ’re talking about . ”
67381	67408	67371	67371	her	160	“ Do n’t worry , Belle is too busy trying to figure out how to drag Devon Whitehall into her bed to think about your husband . ”
67430	67456	67420	67420	I	0	“ Oh , yeah ? I do n’t think you ’ll need to sweat it . The man was all over you like a rash . ”
67457	67465	67466	67466	Belle	148	“ He ’s such a delicious flirt , ”
67477	67484	67470	67470	her	148	“ What about you and Sam ? ”
67490	67494	67485	67485	I	0	“ Any progress ? ”
67495	67515	67516	67516	Ash	160	“ If it ’s not going to happen this year , it ’s not going to happen at all . ”
67525	67530	67520	67520	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
67574	67588	67589	67589	Hunter	162	“ Anyone else wants to complain about how I invited the girls over ? ”
67618	67630	67631	67631	Devon	215	“ How ’d you learn to cook and bake like that ? ”
67643	67658	67659	67659	Sailor	158	“ Our mom is one of the best cooks and bakers in the world . ”
67668	67672	67673	67673	Sam	209	“ The best , ”
67794	67801	67802	67802	I	0	“ Thanks , by the way , ”
67843	67847	67833	67833	you	2026	“ What for ? ”
67848	67881	67815	67815	He	515	“ Taking care of Byrne . Paying my debt . Getting me a divorce . Saving me from Hamilton ’s wrath . I never said thank you , and I should have . ”
67882	67891	67924	67924	Hunter	162	“ It ’s a part of our agreement . ”
67892	67902	67815	67815	He	515	“ You taking care of me or avoiding me ? ”
67903	67906	67907	67907	I	0	“ Both . ”
67939	67951	67924	67924	Hunter	162	“ Mo òrga , are you in or are you out ? ”
67952	67955	67956	67956	Kill	137	“ In . ”
67976	67981	67972	67972	Hunter	162	“ And the missus ? ”
67982	67987	67988	67988	he	515	“ She ’s out , ”
67994	67998	67999	67999	Belle	148	“ Holy shit . ”
68004	68033	68001	68001	her	148	“ Look at the time . It ’s the twenty - first century . That means women can do whatever the hell they like without asking their husbands . ”
68044	68057	68034	68034	Devon	215	“ You needed the phone to check what century you ’re in ? ”
68066	68080	68062	68062	his	515	“ I think it ’s time to lay off the mimosas , sweetheart . ”
68081	68089	68090	68090	Belle	148	“ My sister is going to play . ”
68101	68113	68090	68090	Belle	148	“ Wanna bet ? We ’re already in a gambling mood . ”
68146	68154	68139	68139	they	2031	“ I swear to God , Kill — ”
68155	68159	68163	68163	his	515	“ Drop it . ”
68169	68189	68163	68163	his	515	“ Her ex lost her entire worldly possessions in poker . Think she wants to relive that , Einstein ? ”
68210	68216	68207	68207	his	515	“ Yeah . Thought so . ”
68217	68231	68240	68240	her	541	“ If I were her , I ’d play just to spite you , ”
68255	68279	68284	68284	his	137	“ That ’s why you ’re not her . Why she ’s married to a billionaire and you ’re running a strip club , ”
68294	68312	68284	68284	his	137	“ Madame Mayhem is a respectable institution . Burlesque is not the same as stripping , assface . ”
68318	68324	68313	68313	Belle	148	“ I do love burlesque , ”
68333	68343	68344	68344	Kill	137	“ You ’d love genocide if Emmabelle did it , ”
68347	68350	68351	68351	Sam	209	“ Stakes ? ”
68358	68377	68351	68351	Sam	209	“ Not that I ’m not entertained by watching you all bickering like a flock of old hens . ”
68378	68383	68384	68384	Kill	137	“ Same as always , ”
68387	68410	68384	68384	Kill	137	“ Like hell they are . Not everyone at this table can afford throwing a bunch of money on a poker game . ”
68419	68429	68411	68411	Belle	148	“ I ’m not playing for thousands of dollars . ”
68430	68437	68438	68438	Sailor	158	“ We can play for less , ”
68442	68447	68448	68448	Hunter	162	“ Or strip poker . ”
68451	68478	68448	68448	Hunter	162	“ Unfortunately for Emmabelle , strip poker would also put her at a point of disadvantage , considering she ’s wearing nothing more than a napkin . ”
68520	68523	68524	68524	I	0	“ Cillian , ”
68528	68531	68524	68524	I	0	“ Please . ”
68532	68538	68539	68540	My sister	541	“ You ’re an asshole . ”
68551	68559	68560	68560	Kill	137	“ And you ’re stating the obvious . ”
68566	68609	68610	68610	Kill	137	“ How about we make this interesting ? The stakes stay the same as always , seeing as you ’re the only broke person at this table . If you lose , I ’ll foot the bill . And if I win , ”
68629	68638	68621	68621	his	137	“ I get what I want from you . ”
68720	68731	68732	68732	Emmabelle	153	“ And what is it that you want from me ? ”
68743	68751	68732	68732	Emmabelle	153	“ The most precious gift of all , ”
68755	68824	68825	68825	He	137	“ Silence . More specifically , if I win , you will stop treating my wife like a helpless lamb I ’m about to annihilate . I hear and see everything . You ’re not giving my marriage a fair chance . You badmouth me every step of the way . It is disrespectful to Persephone , and it stops today . That applies to you , too . ”
68832	68888	68825	68825	He	137	“ Same stakes . Same terms . Either of you win — you get the money . I win — I pay your debt , and in return , you hop off the Cillian is Satan train . If my wife wants to ride it , she ’ll buy her own ticket and travel solo . ”
68906	68916	68917	68917	Sailor	158	“ Are you saying what you have is real ? ”
68920	68930	68931	68931	he	137	“ I ’m saying what we have is ours , ”
68934	68971	68972	68972	Kill	137	“ It ’s between Persephone and me . Did n’t hear any objections when Sailor was on babysitting duty to make sure Hunter ’s dick was n’t going on a world tour in their shared apartment . ”
69029	69037	69038	69038	Belle	148	“ I ’m a good poker player . ”
69059	69063	69064	69064	Sailor	158	“ Me too , ”
69070	69077	69067	69067	Kill	137	“ I ’ll take my chances . ”
69159	69167	69168	69168	His	515	“ So . You want a divorce . ”
69202	69245	69177	69177	He	515	“ If I ’m destined for a life chasing after my husband begging him to get into bed with me , then yes , I want a divorce . You never should ’ve married me if you do n’t find me attractive . ”
69246	69253	69254	69254	He	515	“ I do find you attractive . ”
69267	69277	69259	69259	he	515	“ The problem is I find you too attractive . ”
69278	69283	69284	69284	I	0	“ I ’m confused , ”
69308	69328	69296	69296	him	515	“ So am I. Every time I look at you . Which is why I ’ve been avoiding you . ”
69329	69334	69335	69335	I	0	“ I have needs . ”
69340	69346	69347	69347	he	515	“ And I have skills , ”

69525	69533	69534	69534	She	148	“ He ’s bluffing . I raise . ”
69545	69554	69534	69534	She	148	“ So brazen with other people ’s money . ”
69559	69565	69566	69566	Belle	148	“ I ’m always brazen , ”
69569	69588	69566	69566	Belle	148	“ But when it comes to putting assholes in their place , I ’m also gleeful about it . ”
69589	69593	69594	69594	Sailor	158	“ I fold . ”
69604	69616	69594	69594	Sailor	158	“ Sorry . You know it physically hurts me to lose . ”
69617	69623	69624	69624	Hunter	162	“ Me too , dammit . ”
69656	69686	69648	69648	his	215	“ Is this a who’s - got - the - biggest - cock competition ? Because Emmabelle , my darling , I would be sorely disappointed if you win . ”
69687	69692	69693	69693	Sam	209	“ But not undeterred , ”
69696	69714	69693	69693	Sam	209	“ Roll your fucking tongue back into your mouth . You ’re drooling into the tortilla bowl . ”
69792	69798	69799	69799	Emmabelle	153	“ Show us your cards , ”
69802	69806	69807	69807	he	515	“ Ask nicely , ”
69811	69831	69832	69832	Hunter	162	“ Goddammit , Kill , read the room . You ’re about a snarky remark away from getting stabbed . ”
69889	69896	69897	69897	Sailor	158	“ Are you okay , Pers ? ”
69902	69917	69897	69897	Sailor	158	“ I do n’t know about her , but her husband sure is n’t . ”
69929	69947	69953	69953	she	148	“ You ’ve got nothing , American Psycho . I , however , have a full house . ”
69964	69973	69953	69953	she	148	“ I ’m fine , just … just … ”
70057	70061	70062	70062	Sailor	158	“ You what ? ”
70065	70074	70062	70062	Sailor	158	“ I pulled a muscle in my foot . ”

70615	70625	70626	70626	Sam	209	“ I do n’t play to win or lose , ”

70637	70653	70604	70604	Hunter	162	“ To study my opponents , find their weakness , and use it against them . ”
70654	70657	70658	70658	Hunter	162	“ Ah . ”
70661	70672	70658	70658	Hunter	162	“ Remind me to never get on your bad side . ”

In the meantime , I remind you that you ’ve agreed not to interfere with my marriage . No brainwashing my wife or giving her a piece of your mind about me . She ’s a big girl and can make her own decisions . Same goes to you . ”

72625	72649	72614	72614	I	0	“ I saw this on a TV show . Billions . It ’s a contract in which you sell your soul to me . ”

72773	72779	72780	72780	She	3978	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
72783	72817	72780	72780	She	3978	“ You already told me I can never have your heart and mentioned you do n’t believe in souls . That means selling yours to me should n’t be too hard , right ? ”
72888	72902	72903	72903	She	3978	“ It ’s okay if you do n’t want to take any chances . ”

72932	72944	72928	72928	I	0	“ In that case , I ’d like to buy yours . ”

72974	73009	72971	72971	She	3978	“ The girl — who has a similar set of beliefs and views on the world as you — signed the contract , proving she truly did n’t believe in her soul ’s existence . ”
73010	73014	73015	73015	I	0	“ Amateur mistake . ”
73042	73093	73015	73015	I	0	“ First rule in business is supply and demand . You put a price on something in accordance to how other people value it . My set of beliefs is irrelevant . You think souls exist , and therefore I will sign mine over to you for the highest price . ”
73094	73101	73118	73118	her	3978	“ What would that price be ? ”
73102	73110	73111	73111	I	0	“ Your full submission to our arrangement . ”

73261	73302	73247	73247	She	3978	“ I ’m glad we ’re going to this charity event . We have n’t gone out as a couple since we got married . Paxton and I used to have date nights all the time . I miss that . ”

73353	73407	73340	73340	She	3978	“ We had an annual Disney pass . I love a good fairy tale . We used to go to restaurants , dance clubs , football games . Oh , and have picnics , sometimes . Our dream honeymoon was to go to Namibia , but we were too broke to do it . ”
73408	73412	73340	73340	She	3978	“ Why Namibia ? ”
73419	73473	73340	73340	She	3978	“ I once saw a picture of the Namibian desert in a journal . The yellow dunes looked like velvet . I became obsessed with lying on one of those perfect dunes and looking up at the sun . It looked like the height of being alive . So poignant . So pure . ”
73504	73511	73485	73485	I	0	“ We had a good run . ”
73548	73574	73575	73575	I	0	“ A man named Andrew Arrowsmith is going to be at the charity ball . He ’s the one filing a lawsuit against Royal Pipelines . ”

73628	73645	73621	73621	She	3978	“ Why do I get the feeling there ’s more to this story than a lawsuit ? ”
73646	73672	73575	73575	I	0	“ We go back . We grew up together , went to the same schools for a while . His late father worked for mine . ”
73673	73689	73621	73621	She	3978	“ I ’m guessing his departure did n’t include any employee of the year awards . ”
73690	73721	73722	73722	Persephone	138	“ Athair made him do the walk of shame and blacklisted him from working at any reputable company on the East Coast . Arrowsmith Senior had a knack for embezzling . ”
73727	73734	73724	73724	her	3978	“ So this lawsuit is personal ? ”
73742	73748	73735	73735	I	0	“ Arrowsmith Senior died recently . ”
73749	73765	73766	73766	She	3978	“ Which opened the old wound , making Andrew take the job at Green Living . ”
73792	73804	73805	73805	She	3978	“ How come the media has n’t picked up on it ? ”
73821	73836	73813	73813	I	0	“ His hidden agenda , I mean . He ’s a highly public figure . ”
73837	73845	73805	73805	She	3978	“ I have n’t leaked it yet . ”
73846	73849	73805	73805	She	3978	“ Why ? ”
73850	73878	73813	73813	I	0	“ Arrowsmith ’s got something on me , too . We ’re hanging our sins over each other ’s head , waiting to see who blinks first . ”
73879	73889	73805	73805	She	3978	“ Let ’s make him flinch then , hubs . ”
73890	73914	73915	73915	She	3978	“ There is n’t a we in this operation . You worry about giving me heirs , and I ’ll worry about Arrowsmith . ”
73947	73962	73963	73963	She	3978	“ I mean it , Flower Girl . Do n’t butt into my business . ”
73968	73975	73963	73963	She	3978	“ What are you looking at ? ”
73979	74001	73976	73976	I	0	“ You held my hand in yours the entire length of the drive . Since you took the contract from me . ”

Does n’t know the extent of embarrassment you ’ve caused the Fitzpatrick name . You touch Green Living , and I will make sure everyone in the world knows your story . Your history . The ugly lies and uncomfortable truths . It ’s either economic carnage or a private bloodbath , Fitzy . Your pick . But I ’ve a feeling you already came to terms with the fact I ’m going to destroy Royal Pipelines . ”

76773	76809	76765	76765	I	0	“ And it is clear she is still with her ex - husband . I mean , why else would she be visiting her grandmother - in - law at a retirement home every weekend ? ”
76829	76904	76810	76810	Joelle	236	“ I mean , it makes sense . She was penniless with no prospects . And it was high time you got married . The pressure was on , I ’m sure . If you ask me , arranged marriages have their merits . So how does it work , exactly ? Are there three of you in this marriage , or does Mr. Veitch pop in every few weeks for a visit … ? ”
76967	77065	76954	76954	Joelle	236	“ Please , Cillian , people talk . The minute the country club folks in Back Bay heard about your nuptials , tongues started wagging . Paxton Veitch was my tennis mate ’s student in high school , so she volunteered the information . Apparently , she still visits his grandmother , too . Poor thing has no other relatives in Boston , and she ’s in quite a state . I ’m told your wife has n’t missed a visit in three years , not long after she started dating him . Familia primum , huh ? ”
77100	77106	77107	77107	I	0	“ Here ’s the thing . ”
77126	77222	77107	77107	I	0	“ My marriage may be a sham , but at least my wife and I are upfront about it . Your marriage is a farce , and I bet you ’re dumb enough to believe it ’s the real deal . Let me guess — you come from money , do n’t you , Joelle ? Never worked a day in your life . You have a nice , albeit useless bachelor ’s degree from an Ivy League university , a prestigious lineage , and trust funds coming out of every hole in your body ? ”
77251	77430	77431	77431	I	0	“ Everything Andrew Arrowsmith has done from the moment he was born was to try to make up for the fact he was n’t born into the Fitzpatrick family . He ate from our plates , played in our backyard , and attended the same extracurricular classes I took part in . His family went as far as to send him to the same schools as me . But make no mistakes — the Arrowsmiths never sliced through the airtight seal of Boston ’s upper crust . He is our hang - on , and you , my dear , are his meal ticket . While it is true that I , too , stand in your position of feeding an ambitious , good - looking go - getter of the world , at least I married a woman I ’d like to take to bed every night . You married a social climber who would n’t touch you with a ten - foot pole given the chance . When was the last time he ate you out ? ”
77449	77481	77482	77482	She	2224	“ Ravaged you like you were a precious prize and not a check he needed to deposit ? Your husband is cheating on you , is n’t he , Mrs. Arrowsmith ? ”
77514	77560	77491	77491	I	0	“ That ’s what I thought . Tell anyone about my wife visiting her former grandmother - in - law , and I will make sure everyone in America knows your husband has side pieces . Enjoy the rest of your evening , Mrs. Arrowsmith . ”

78121	78161	78114	78114	she	3978	“ She has no one . She is senile , and lonely , and in desperate need of companionship . She does n’t have much longer to live . I ’m not going to turn my back on her . ”

78501	78593	78498	78498	she	3978	“ Listen to me . The two most important decisions in our lives are not ours to make . Our creation and our death . We do n’t choose to be born , and we do n’t choose when or how we die . But everything in - between ? That ’s our jurisdiction . We can fill in the blanks as we please . And I choose to fill mine by doing the right thing . By being a good friend — a good human — according to my standards . ”

I was still in diapers when he and Arrowsmith were friends , but from my understanding , they were inseparable at a point . The way the story goes — mind you , I picked scraps and pieces of it from different sources and puzzled it all together in my head — Kill and Andrew were best friends from birth . They were born on the same day , at the same Boston hospital , both a little underweight . My father had met Andrew ’s father while both of them were watching their newborn sons through a glass window . Shortly after , Athair had hired Andrew ’s dad as an accountant for Royal Pipelines . Cillian and Andrew did everything together , and when it was time for Kill to go to Evon as per our family tradition , Athair footed half the bill and sent Andrew along with him . Kill and Andy were like brothers . Spending their summer vacations together . Riding together , having sleepovers , planning world domination side by side . Until Athair fired Andrew ’s dad and sued him for all the money he ’d stolen from Royal Pipelines , leaving the Arrowsmith family penniless and struggling to make ends meet . Athair cut off the cash flow to Andrew ’s education , punishing the son for his father ’s sins . Andrew ’s dad refused to admit defeat and pull his son out of Evon the first year . He wanted to save face . The family resorted to begging their relatives for loans . Some say Andrew ’s mother , Judy , became some rich guy ’s plaything to keep their heads above water . Andrew ’s parents divorced not long after . He dropped out of Evon the following year and moved into a tiny apartment in Southie with his mother and sister . Their lives fell apart , and so did the close friendship between Andy and Kill . The families drew an invisible line in Boston , splitting it down the middle , avoiding one another at all costs . ”
84234	84248	84249	84249	I	0	“ Did Andrew try to retaliate for your father ’s decision through Kill ? ”
84271	84332	84254	84254	her	160	“ Mom said the one year Andrew and Cillian spent in Evon together almost cost her a son . My older brother lost a lot of weight , quit playing polo , and withdrew completely from the world . My brother has always been cold and different , but after that year , everyone agreed he ’d become , well … ”

85787	85806	85784	85784	Petar	262	“ And if there ’s anything I can do to make you stay , please let me know . ”
86012	86019	86020	86020	he	137	“ That ’s not your bed , ”
86023	86042	86020	86020	he	137	“ If I ’m good enough to warm it , I ’m good enough to sleep in it . ”
86058	86086	86043	86043	I	0	“ No one said you ’re good enough to warm it . I took you on the kitchen counter and against the window , not my bed . ”
86087	86098	86099	86099	I	0	“ Keeping track and cherishing every moment , I see . ”

86180	86223	86163	86163	He	294	“ My social calendar is — by choice — wide open . As your legs should be every night when I come back home , by the way . It is not my job to undress you to candlelight and Frank Sinatra . ”

86252	86355	86248	86248	I	0	“ Today . Or live a life of celibacy . I ’m not your blowup doll . If you want me to fulfill my marital duties , you better believe you are going to fulfill yours . You will never , ever touch my things without my permission again , move me around like I ’m a chess piece , or make a decision about our lives without consulting me first . Additionally , you will be home every evening not a minute after seven , so we can have a meal together before we have sex . Like a normal couple . ”
86356	86414	86415	86415	He	2390	“ What part of our relationship gave you the illusion of a normal couple , the fact I bought your ass like you were a discounted bread maker on Black Friday , or had you sign a thirty - seven - page contract , an NDA , and a waiver before putting a ring on your finger ? ”
86501	86504	86505	86505	I	0	“ Furthermore , ”
86516	86530	86505	86505	I	0	“ during dinner , we ’ll perform the taxing task of small talk . ”

86598	86604	86581	86581	His	515	“ The answer is no . ”
86605	86659	86660	86660	I	0	“ Fine . Let ’s go through the whole routine where I refuse you a few weeks in a row , and you march back to your bed unsatisfied , then go to the office , see Hunter waving around 3D ultrasound pictures of his future child , then do it my way . ”
86700	86706	86707	86707	He	515	“ Careful , Flower Girl . ”

87374	87387	87388	87388	I	0	“ Shame . You were so good at tying us with it , ”

88090	88093	88094	88094	He	2407	“ Why ? ”
88121	88131	88115	88115	Kill	137	“ Because I know you would never hurt me . ”

88539	88568	88532	88532	I	0	“ Mr. Fitzpatrick , you did not ask for permission to untie me . You will not do so until I explicitly request it . Am I clear ? ”
88580	88591	88592	88592	he	515	“ I do n’t normally see them the morning after , ”
88596	88607	88592	88592	he	515	“ I ’ve never stopped to wonder what it looks — ”
88608	88622	88623	88623	I	0	“ Do n’t tell me about your whores while we ’re in bed ! ”
88669	88684	88659	88659	I	0	“ Actually , do n’t tell me about them out of it , either . ”
88685	88692	88693	88693	he	515	“ There are no whores anymore , ”
88697	88704	88693	88693	he	515	“ You made sure of that . ”
88705	88708	88709	88709	I	0	“ Good . ”
88723	88749	88709	88709	I	0	“ I hope your mistresses go bankrupt now that you are not there to pay them , and get a real job to support themselves . ”
88750	88755	88756	88756	he	515	“ You ’re insane , ”
88766	88804	88759	88759	his	515	“ Well , lucky for me , hubs , you ’re not charting high on the sanity spectrum , either . Now do what you want to do to me . And make it worth my while . ”

90046	90054	90055	90055	I	0	“ Is this supposed to be funny ? ”
90079	90093	90062	90062	He	137	“ Thanks for letting me know . I ’ll plan my evening accordingly . ”
90094	90098	90099	90099	I	0	“ Have fun , ”
90112	90117	90099	90099	I	0	“ I intend to . ”
90222	90228	90229	90229	He	137	“ Did you call me ? ”

90692	90708	90665	90665	he	137	“ Fine . But we ’ll do it my way . I ’ve got requirements . ”
90709	90712	90713	90713	I	0	“ Shocker ! ”
90724	90729	90721	90721	I	0	“ I ’m listening . ”

90793	90802	90803	90803	He	137	“ More tongue . More saliva . More . ”
90858	90861	90862	90862	he	137	“ Well , ”
90883	90904	90905	90905	I	0	“ I was going to keep the line between respectful wife and my flings firmly drawn , but I suppose … ”
90934	90953	90954	90954	he	137	“ I suppose the line has already been crossed . Choke on my cock , you beautiful slut , ”
91010	91022	91023	91023	His	137	“ Tap my thigh twice if you want me to stop . ”
91135	91140	91141	91141	he	137	“ That was good , ”
91144	91153	91141	91141	he	137	“ You get an A+ , Flower Girl . ”
91154	91165	91166	91166	I	0	“ Then why did n’t you come in my mouth ? ”
91182	91188	91189	91189	He	137	“ Instinct , I suppose . ”

91279	91286	91287	91287	He	137	“ Fine . Nipples it is . ”
91557	91588	91589	91589	she	146	“ They fell a bit behind on the material . As you know , there are certain milestones they need to hit by the time they go to first grade , ”
91803	91813	91787	91787	her	236	“ God , you look fresh as a daisy . ”
91821	91835	91818	91818	I	0	“ Well , I try to get eight hours of sleep every night . ”
91836	91855	91877	91877	She	236	“ The twins wake up several times a night to go to the bathroom and ask for water . ”
91856	91864	91865	91865	I	0	“ You need to sleep train them , ”
91868	91876	91865	91865	I	0	“ I can help you with that . ”
91971	91981	91952	91952	Tree	231	“ Children , please calm down . I apologize . ”
91990	92039	91982	91982	Joelle	236	“ The nanny is a middle - aged woman from France . See , we really wanted them to be bilingual . But she did n’t know what I meant . My eyes traveled to her designer shirt , which was not only stained , but inside out . “

92096	92144	92146	92146	you	2498	” These kids looked thirsty for attention , conversation , and exploration . A second language was the last thing they needed . I got up from the floor and headed to the kitchen with the twins and Joelle following me as though they were the guests . “
92155	92213	92214	92214	I	0	” Joelle mused , quickly losing her reservations . It took her a full month to come to terms with the fact she needed my help . After all , I was her husband ’s enemy ’s wife . Now that she took the leap , she figured she ’d squeeze the hell out of the arrangement . “
92228	92232	92146	92146	you	2498	” I asked . “
92280	92294	92146	92146	you	2498	” I eyed her in disbelief . She gave her hair a toss . “

92315	92333	92303	92303	Andrew	235	” I did n’t see anything , other than how this couple had their priorities all wrong . “
92341	92346	92336	92336	your	0	” she asked primly . “
92353	92365	92336	92336	your	0	” I answered . She tilted her head , taken aback . “
92371	92375	92336	92336	your	0	” I smiled . “
92384	92425	92336	92336	your	0	” Not that I did it for the money . In fact , I ’d already decided I would donate every penny given to me by the Arrowsmiths . It felt morally wrong to spend Cillian ’s enemy ’s money . “
92437	92450	92451	92451	We	2503	” Joelle scanned me in new eyes , her face lighting up . “
92454	92520	92451	92451	We	2503	” It was technically true . Kill and I did have separate accounts . But that did n’t mean I did n’t have access to his money . Money I ’d refused to spend . I still only used whatever I was paid every Friday by Little Genius , letting the astronomical amount of dollars Kill transferred pile up in my checking account , untouched . “
92542	92555	92633	92633	You	2505	” Joelle stretched her arm in my direction . I shook it . “
92572	92573	92560	92560	I	0	” “
92580	92595	92560	92560	I	0	” She gave herself away . So she was the one who told Kill . “
92602	92612	92598	92598	yourself	2505	” Turning around to the twins , I exclaimed , “
92636	92637	92633	92633	You	2505	” “
92640	92868	92633	92633	You	2505	” Tree pumped the air with his fist . Tinder nodded , eyeing me shyly . He was obviously more reserved than his brother . I herded the boys to the bathroom to wash our hands , rubbing between their fingers as we made funny hygiene songs that included a lot of fart jokes . Meanwhile , Joelle set up her laptop in the kitchen so she could see us . I appreciated that , if nothing else , she was concerned enough to keep an eye on us . I set bowls with flour and sugar on the kitchen counter and dragged two chairs for the boys to stand on . We cracked eggs , added oil and water , then battered , sang , and whistled as we worked . Every now and again , I ’d catch Joelle watching us with longing mixed with envy and fascination . Andrew was n’t at home . I had the feeling he rarely was , which made spying on him a little harder . We poured the batter into letter - shaped cutters . While we waited for the oven to heat , I emptied a mixed bag of colorful sprinkles into a bowl and asked the boys to separate the colors . It was a great exercise in patience , self - soothing , and teamwork . “
92879	92885	92633	92633	You	2505	” I sing - songed . “
92892	92898	92888	92888	my	0	” The color of pomegranate . “
92903	92909	92899	92899	I	0	” Tree exploded into giggles . “

92938	92944	92945	92945	Tinder	233	” Tree blew a raspberry . “
92951	92973	92947	92947	Elsa	368	” The boy stubbed a pudgy finger at his brother ’s chest , leaving a cloud of flour on his shirt . “
92977	92984	92976	92976	I.	0	” I high - fived Tinder . “
92995	92996	92990	92990	She	368	” “
93004	93015	93016	93016	He	2508	” Tree said defensively , pitching the idea to me . “
93030	93031	93016	93016	He	2508	” “
93040	93114	93036	93036	he	2508	” Tinder grinned , gaining confidence with me by his side . The differences between Tree and Tinder were staggering . Tree was talkative , animated , and naturally curious . Tinder stuttered , and his left eye twitched frequently . His jerky movements and low - hanging head told me he was extremely insecure . He also chewed on the collar of his shirt until a pool of saliva formed around it . “
93117	93126	93036	93036	he	2508	” Tree narrowed his eyes at his brother . “

93150	93178	93148	93148	you	369	” Joelle darted from the table , advancing toward us . She grabbed Tinder by the shoulder . I put my hand on hers , stopping her . “
93183	93187	93148	93148	you	369	” I said . “

93217	93226	93208	93208	He	233	” she burst , her lower lip trembling . “
93230	93237	93208	93208	He	233	” I whispered under my breath . “
93257	93282	93284	93284	me	0	” We held each other ’s gazes for a second . Luckily , the oven dinged , signaling it had reached our desired temperature . “
93286	93336	93284	93284	me	0	” I grabbed the trays . I sent the children to wash their hands again , asking them to sing the songs we ’d made up together from the top of their lungs while I tidied up the kitchen . That gave Joelle and me a few minutes alone . “
93339	93367	93337	93337	Joelle	236	” I started cautiously . I did n’t know how much time I was going to have with this family , but I knew they needed me . “

93376	93387	93368	93368	Tinder	233	” she cut me off , fidgeting with her necklace . “

93428	93437	93407	93407	I	0	” I put my hand on her arm . “
93507	93542	93498	93498	He	233	” Her shoulders sagged with a deep sigh . By the exhausted look on her face , I could tell she ’d been wanting to talk about this with someone for a long time . “
93594	93595	93608	93608	his	233	” “
93611	93618	93619	93620	Different kids	2522	” I completed for her curtly . “
93649	93754	93755	93755	You	0	” Me , for example . I had n’t told Kill but getting my period despite having unprotected sex with him for a couple of months unraveled me from the inside . It should n’t have . Two months meant nothing in the grand scheme of things . I read somewhere that it takes between eight to eleven months for the average couple to get pregnant if they actively try . But other couples were n’t on a deadline . I knew if I failed to give him heirs , Cillian would get them elsewhere . The thought made me want to throw up . “
93759	93765	93755	93755	You	0	” Joelle straightened her spine . “
93813	93839	93808	93808	he	233	” The light in her eyes was back , and that was when I realized I ’d never seen it on in the first place . “

93905	93909	93887	93887	They	2527	” I snorted . “

93940	93945	93946	93946	You	0	” Joelle admitted hoarsely . “
93955	93960	93946	93946	You	0	” I assured her . “

93973	94050	93969	93969	you	0	” We spent the rest of the afternoon together . By the time I got out of the Arrowsmiths ’ house , I knew I was in deep trouble . As much as I hated Andrew Arrowsmith for what he did — and was still doing — to my husband , I could n’t help but like his family . Ultimately , I was going to hurt them . For now , I tried to heal them .

95368	95387	95388	95388	Hunter	162	“ Very soon , when Persy finally realizes she married a robot and kicks him to the curb . ”

95699	95786	95689	95689	Sam	209	“ One of the angles they ’re going to use in court is defamation . Specifically , the poor state of your marriage . They ’re going to imply your character is flawed through your estranged relationship with Persephone . Basically , they ’re going to heavily suggest you ’re an abusive husband . Your wife is employed by them and receives a salary from them . She visits their house three to four times a week , which I ’m sure you are aware of . ”
95800	95844	95845	95845	I	0	“ Not only is Persy spending most of her time with the Arrowsmiths , but you do n’t have a family life to speak of . It looks bad . The apartment you ’re still renting for her , your separate bank accounts … ”

95915	95969	95911	95911	I	0	“ But I deposit a sixty - thousand - dollar monthly allowance into her checking account . Seeing as she lives under my roof , eats my food , and generally lives at my expense , I figured this would be a sufficient amount for her not to look for any side gigs . ”

96116	96144	96080	96080	his	209	“ Because I do n’t care much what she does in her free time as long as she does n’t nag me to spend time with her . ”
96145	96191	96104	96104	I	0	“ Well , start caring if you want to win the case against Arrowsmith . Tell your wife to drop their asses , pronto . If there ’s one thing you do n’t need right now , it ’s for Persephone to give Arrowsmith ammo . ”

96323	96335	96336	96336	I	0	“ Why would I waste my precious resources on my wife ? ”

96434	96438	96439	96439	I	0	“ Anything else ? ”
96447	96450	96451	96451	He	2582	“ Yes . ”
96458	96534	96451	96451	He	2582	“ Get your shit together . I ’ve never seen you lose a poker game unintentionally . These assholes ripped you a new hole today , and it has n’t even been an hour . I ’ve never seen you at home before nine o’clock in the evening before , either . Guess what ? Last week , I dropped by your office at half past six and was told you ’d gone home early . ”
96616	96631	96632	96632	He	209	“ I said I ’ll talk to her . Know where the door is ? ”
96639	96643	96632	96632	He	209	“ Of course . ”

96885	96892	96893	96893	Her	138	“ Have you been following me ? ”
96920	96951	96903	96903	I	0	“ Sweetheart , let ’s not pretend I care enough to have you followed . Sam follows Andrew , and he saw you going in and out of his house . ”
96952	96958	96959	96959	She	138	“ Sam ’s an asshole . ”
96986	97075	96971	96971	I	0	“ What Sam is and is n’t is not my concern . I ’m not married to him . You , however , are currently breaking a contract you signed . The non - compete clause . You went and ran your mouth to my enemy like the little idiot that you are , telling him we have separate accounts . Now Andrew is going to use your employment in court to show that I am an unloving , neglectful husband in order to establish my bad character . ”
97076	97083	97084	97084	She	2592	“ You are an unloving husband . ”
97095	97103	97086	97086	her	2592	“ Love was n’t in the contract . ”
97104	97109	97110	97110	she	2592	“ Screw your contract ! ”
97120	97131	97114	97114	her	2592	“ Why ? Screwing you is so much more enjoyable . ”
97177	97194	97171	97171	I	0	“ Quit tomorrow morning . I wo n’t ask twice . This is non - negotiable . ”

97324	97339	97342	97342	She	2592	“ Disobey , and I will give you what you ’ve been begging for . ”
97361	97365	97366	97366	she	2592	“ Say it , ”

97436	97527	97427	97427	Her	2592	“ If you continue to ignore our contract , I ’ll have to break my part of the bargain , too . If you still work for the Arrowsmiths by mid - week , I ’m putting Sam on your ass to tail your every movement . Next , I ’m taking a flight to Europe , to fuck every abled body in my vicinity . Then — without taking a shower to wash them off — I’ll come back to put a baby in you , with ovulation tests . ”

You ’ve been hot for this dick since the day you saw me . But you ’d hate yourself for it , and every time you would look at our child , you would see what I ’ve done to you . Know your place , Persephone . You are not here to co - rule the kingdom by my side . Merely to help me continue it . ”
97677	97685	97686	97686	She	2600	“ You would n’t touch someone else . ”

97889	97893	97894	97894	I	0	“ I have , ”
97897	97931	97894	97894	I	0	“ The minute I came up with this plan , I made a list of pros , cons , and potential complications . Possible infertility was at the top of the cons list . ”

97936	97942	97943	97943	She	2600	“ And everyone is replaceable . ”
97951	97955	97956	97956	she	2600	“ I see , ”
97960	97973	97956	97956	she	2600	“ In that case , do n’t let me waste your time . ”
97993	98016	98017	98017	she	2600	“ I ’ll be continuing my employment with the Arrowsmiths . You can find another suitable candidate to have your precious children , ”

100621	100655	100749	100751	One premium cunt	2685	“ … ripping him a new one . You have to calm down , Kill . You ’ve been going so hard at Arrowsmith . You ’re lucky people have n’t noticed yet . ”
100656	100665	100749	100751	One premium cunt	2685	“ Kill thinks luck is just lazy math . ”
100666	100703	100749	100751	One premium cunt	2685	“ Kill is not thinking at all . Check out his face . He looks like he is about to kick all of us out again so he can have a snuggling session with Wifey Dearest . ”

100977	100986	100973	100973	Sam	209	“ So I ’ll know who to fire . ”
100999	101011	100994	100994	She	138	“ Shut up , Brennan . Just shut the hell up ! ”

101173	101224	101165	101165	I	0	“ Care to tell me something I do n’t know ? I told you about my plans last week . One of them was to have you tailed . Did you think I was n’t going to follow through with my threats ? Did you think you were … special ? ”
101259	101269	101270	101270	she	2698	“ You ’re following through on all your threats , ”
101331	101336	101327	101327	I	0	“ All of them . ”
101337	101345	101346	101346	she	2698	“ Following me was against the contract , ”
101365	101384	101385	101385	I	0	“ Actually , I found a loophole . Sam did the following . I only gave the order . ”

102027	102049	102019	102019	He	262	“ I … ah … she … she did n’t say . I figured she was going on a weekend somewhere ? ”
102050	102058	102059	102059	I	0	“ And why would you figure that ? ”
102065	102084	102059	102059	I	0	“ Well , because she took several suitcases with her and did n’t want any help with them . ”
102085	102094	102095	102095	I	0	“ Did she say where she was going ? ”

102166	102176	102156	102156	He	262	“ Seven . She took seven suitcases , sir . ”
102177	102188	102189	102189	I	0	“ And you thought she was going for a weekend , ”
102520	102529	102530	102530	Sailor	158	“ I ’m going to kill my brother , ”

102644	102674	102634	102634	Belle	148	“ I ’m leaning toward castrating him and letting him bleed out . Not necessarily using a blunt object . Something that would make the process slow and painful . ”
102675	102697	102698	102698	Ash	160	“ Medically speaking , I do n’t think there ’s a non - painful way to castrate a man to death , ”
102712	102719	102705	102705	her	160	“ Was it really that bad ? ”
102720	102726	102727	102727	Sailor	158	“ Yes , it was , ”
102737	102793	102727	102727	Sailor	158	“ You know Pers , she ’d never breathe a bad word about someone if her life depended on it . Hunter was there , and he told me himself . Said he was shocked by Kill ’s behavior . Recently , he was under the impression Cillian and you had a good thing going . ”
102794	102806	102807	102807	I	0	“ Honestly ? I was dumb enough to think the same . ”
102862	102936	102937	102937	Ash	160	“ You know I think Kill having private investigators follow you is deplorable , but you never actually told us what the nature of your relationship was . Again , I ’m not trying to make excuses for my brother . I grew up seeing him at his best and his worst , so I know both versions of him are frightening to the average person . But your relationship was never explained , ”
102941	102961	102937	102937	Ash	160	“ I just want to make sure we ’re getting the entire picture so we can advise you accordingly . ”
102962	102969	102970	102970	Belle	148	“ Ash ’s got a point . ”
102976	102991	102992	102992	She	148	“ You just told us you ’re getting hitched one day , then poof ! ”
102997	103052	102994	102994	her	148	“ You were a married woman . Every time we see you with your husband , he looks at you like you ’re the brightest star in the sky . At the same time , we all know you did not go the usual couple route . Tell us how you became Mrs. Fitzpatrick . ”
103135	103205	103132	103132	I	0	“ When Paxton left me , he did n’t leave me with nothing . He left me with a hundred thousand dollars of debt . It was the worst eight months of my life . The loan sharks he ’d been indebted to chased me around , lurked outside my workplace , patrolled Belle ’s apartment … it got real bad . They even physically attacked me one time . ”
103247	103289	103241	103241	I	0	“ It was the time I told you I got mugged . I did n’t want to ask Hunter , Sailor , or Aisling for the money . It was n’t a small sum . It was a straight up fortune . ”
103290	103297	103298	103298	Aisling	160	“ We would n’t have minded ! ”
103302	103308	103298	103298	Aisling	160	“ Do n’t be stupid . ”
103314	103329	103311	103311	her	158	“ Of course you could ’ve asked us for it . You ’re family . ”
103353	103416	103349	103349	I	0	“ When things went from bad to worse with the creditors , I went to Cillian ’s office and asked for a loan . He said no . A few days later , he came back with the marriage proposal . He said all my problems would go away if I said yes , and … well , he kept his promise . ”
103521	103530	103531	103531	I	0	“ Wanna know what the worst part is ? ”
103552	103675	103531	103531	I	0	“ That I still love him . I ’ve always loved him . The first time I saw him at that charity ball Sailor dragged us to because she did n’t want to be alone with Hunter and I set my sight on Cillian , I knew . I knew one day he would take my soul , set it on fire , and walk all over my ashes when it was all done and dealt with . I ’d known it from the very moment I found myself staring at him while he was watching Emmabelle from across the room . He was lost in my sister , but I found myself — everything I ’d ever wanted — in him . ”
103676	103687	103688	103688	Ash	160	“ Kill never looks directly at the things he wants . ”
103693	103714	103688	103688	Ash	160	“ He says desire is a weakness . If he wanted Belle , he would n’t have looked at her . ”
103715	103724	103725	103725	I	0	“ I do n’t know what to do . ”
103735	103773	103725	103725	I	0	“ I told him I want a divorce after the Green Living lawsuit is over . I need to leave . Leave before he breaks whatever ’s still left in me . Leave before he leaves me . ”
103893	104069	103886	103886	Belle	148	“ My mind and my heart are at war right now . I ca n’t believe I ’m saying this , but I ’m about to give you my heart ’s advice . Remember at the cabin , all those months ago ? When Cillian bet his ass in poker and left the money for Sailor and me to take ? The only thing he asked was for us not to badmouth him to you . It was very telling , mostly because Kill ’s name is being dragged through the mud on a daily basis in the news and he does n’t seem to give a shit . I think he cares for you . I think he does n’t want to care for you , but he does . He does n’t want your loved ones to tell you not to be with him . I lost a bet , and I intend to respect it . I ca n’t tell you to leave him , Pers . Not now . Not yet . ”
104074	104097	104098	104098	Sailor	158	“ Sam always says , a child who is not loved by his village will burn it down to feel its warmth , ”
104124	104183	104184	104184	Sailor	158	“ I think Cillian has been watching everything around him burn for far too long . The Fitzpatrick men are wounded , but they hide it very well , and from what I gather , very differently . If anyone can stop him from destroying the rest of the world , it ’s you . Give him time , ”
104187	104197	104184	104184	Sailor	158	“ It ’s the most precious gift of all . ”
104227	104229	104231	104231	her	160	“ I think”—she
104233	104295	104296	104296	She	160	lip—“my brother wants you . I think he cares for you . But I also know he was the same man who blackmailed you into marrying him . He knew your life was in danger , and he took advantage of you . I do n’t know if this is the kind of environment you want to raise your child in . ”
104309	104342	104296	104296	She	160	“ I grew up in a dysfunctional family , and I do n’t have it in me to recommend you go the same route . I do n’t think you should stay . ”
104566	104576	104577	104577	Joelle	236	“ Guess who is here , and with presents ! ”
104646	104657	104658	104658	Tinder	233	“ Auntie Persy , look what I made for you . ”
104711	104742	104697	104697	I	0	“ It ’s a map . If we follow it , we ’ll get to heaven , and in heaven , everyone is nice , and no one hits you ! ”
104771	104778	104766	104766	Tree	231	“ What ’d you get us ? ”
104787	104822	104779	104779	Tree	231	“ Is it a truck ? I told Mommy I want one for Christmas . Red . It has to be red . It must . Your favorite color , right , Auntie Persy ? ”
104823	104849	104850	104850	Joelle	236	“ Tree , my gosh , why would you say that ? Any gift is welcome . The fact she thought about you is enough . ”
105005	105010	105011	105011	Andrew	235	“ You ’re here , ”
105040	105043	105032	105032	him	235	“ Andrew . ”
105044	105063	105090	105090	her	236	“ How ’re you doing , sweetheart ? Is that savage husband of yours still giving you trouble ? ”
105064	105067	105068	105068	Joelle	236	“ Andrew ! ”
105079	105084	105073	105073	I	0	“ It ’s okay . ”
105093	105100	105085	105085	I	0	“ Actually , I moved out . ”
105156	105160	105149	105149	I	0	“ You did ? ”

105243	105265	105239	105239	He	3878	“ Yes . Of course . I wo n’t keep you . I have some … some phone calls to make . ”
105291	105329	105273	105273	He	3878	“ Thank you for sharing this information , Persephone . It means a lot to us to have your trust . You ’d tell us if Mr. Fitzpatrick mistreated you in any way , would n’t you ? ”
105350	105362	105363	105364	The Lannisters	378	“ Of course . You guys are like family to me . ”
105410	105419	105420	105420	She	236	“ Thank you , you should n’t have . ”
105424	105432	105420	105420	She	236	“ I know you save every penny . ”

105678	105713	105672	105672	I	0	“ It ’s a blessing . It makes you grow . Find your strength . There ’s a lot we can learn from children . Things we ’d already forgotten but should n’t have . ”

105719	105765	105766	105766	I	0	“ Like what ’s important in life . Family . Friendship . The beauty of a lone cloud sailing across a perfectly blue sky . Kids have their priorities straight . It ’s us adults who sometimes forget the meaning of life . Now come . ”

I want you to marry someone who gives you what you want . Who is happy with what you ’re willing to give back . And I ’m not that person . I meant what I said . As soon as your legal / PR issues are over and everything quiets down , we can get a divorce . ”

The only thing that ’s changed is that now , I finally realize I never will be . ”

I laid low there . Worked in construction . Saved up whatever I could . At first , I ’d hoped I could come up with half the money , then pay the rest in Boston . I always wanted it to work between us , Persy . I just knew keeping in touch with you was going to put you in a whole lotta risk . Then the news of you marrying Fitzpatrick broke the fucking internet . There were memes about it , dude . I picked up the phone and called Mitch . Asked if it was true . He told me your husband made sure Kaminski could never take a piss standing up again he trashed him so bad . Byrne was n’t doing so hot , either . I realized I was probably next on your husband ’s shit list . That he was going to unleash Sam Brennan on me . Brennan has eyes and ears everywhere , so I moved up to Mexico . Cancun . Stayed with a friend . ”

After you send it , you will pack a bag , drive to the airport , and buy a one - way ticket to Australia . Once there , you will drive to Perth , where you will settle down . Perth , in case you ’re wondering , is the farthest point geographically from the US of A , and therefore exactly where I want you to be , at least until Virgin Galactic offers flights to Mars , to which I would be happy to relocate you . You will not , under any circumstances , contact my wife . You will not , under any circumstances , write , call , or meet her again . If I hear you as much as breathed in her direction , I will unleash my three - headed hounds on you — a Hades reference , in case it escaped your bird - sized brain — no matter where you are .

121950	121993	121942	121942	I	0	“ Knowing my family , we will be keeping my condition under wraps . So either you prescribe me with shit , try new treatment on me , or let me go . I ’ll figure out a way to hide it . ”
121994	122001	122002	122004	the female doctor	3103	“ It ’s a neurological disorder , ”
122013	122106	122007	122007	her	3103	“ Caused by an array of very complex things , mostly because of abnormalities in certain brain regions . The tics will come and go , and even though we can offer some treatments to relieve and ease the disorder , it is mostly here to stay . You ca n’t control it . The very definition of Tourette ’s is that your tics are involuntarily . You can not train your nerves . They are everywhere in your body . To numb them , you will have to stop feeling completely . ”
122109	122115	122116	122116	I	0	“ Then it is voluntary . ”

To extract information . To get a glimpse into his most intimate place . I knew there was too much riding on this operation , and that you ’d try to stop me because you ’re too righteous to accept you needed my help . ”

You saved me from Byrne and Kaminski , from a horse , from a poisonous flower , from my ex - husband . The list goes on and on . Why is it okay for you to give up your entire existence for the world , to put your father ’s needs before yours , to walk through fire for the people you care about , but I ca n’t do you this one solid ? ”
125310	125318	125319	125319	I	0	“ Because you did n’t accomplish anything ! ”
125329	125373	125319	125319	I	0	“ You pretty little idiot , the videos you found wo n’t hold up in court . They are not legal evidence . They ’re stolen , and probably fuzzy , and do n’t capture his face . You ’ve worked for nothing . ”
125404	125436	125397	125397	I	0	“ Your little stunt did nothing more than put another ten - foot dent in our marriage , which , by the way , was the worst mistake of my life . ”

125646	125724	125634	125634	Persephone	138	“ Nothing you found on Andrew ’s laptop can help me win this case . The only thing you did was give him more ammo on me . Now he is probably telling people I sent my wife to sniff around his work and made her perform two jobs to try to dig up some dirt about him . Not only did you not help me , but you also put yourself at risk , and I … ”
125766	125773	125774	125774	she	138	“ And you what , hubs ? ”
125778	125790	125774	125774	she	138	“ What would have happened had Andrew done something to me ? ”
125920	125965	125900	125900	I	0	“ And I wish he ’d finished the job , Flower Girl , so I could finally go ahead and marry someone in my own league . You were a mistake . A foolish , horny mistake . Divorce could n’t come fast enough . ”
126022	126099	126100	126100	She	3978	“ In that case , congratulations . You ’ve worked really hard to show me Andrew turned you into a heartless monster . Consider yourself free from this marriage . Here ’s your parting gift from me . A Child Protective Service report deeming Andrew a dangerous , unfit father . Thought it might be of interest to you , since he ’s lost custody of his children , and will be losing his job next . ”
126112	126309	126310	126310	She	3196	“ I love you , Cillian Fitzpatrick . I ’ve always loved you . From the moment we first met at the charity ball when I spotted you across the room . You were a god among mortals . Vital yet dead . And when you looked at me — when you looked past me — I saw my whole future in your eyes . I knew you were rich , and handsome , and powerful . Yet the only thing I truly ever wanted from you , Kill , was you . To peel off the layers , shed them with my fingernails , and have you , and love you , and save you . I thought I could change you . And I tried . I really did . But I can not change someone who does n’t want to change . I love you , but I love me , too . And I deserve more than you ’ve given me . More than you are willing to part ways with . So I ’m saving you this one time , for all the times you saved me , and saying goodbye . ”
126333	126449	126450	126450	She	3197	“ We ’ve always been so bad at respecting each other ’s boundaries . We broke our contract again and again and again . If you have a shred of sympathy for me in that cold heart of yours , do n’t contact me anymore . No matter what happens , no matter how much you want to tell me something , leave me alone . I need time to digest , to lick my wounds , to move on . Do n’t show up at my sister ’s house , or at my workplace , or anywhere I might be . Let me get over you . My heart ca n’t take another blow . ”

You could n’t look Persephone in the eye like a six - year - old for as long as you ’ve known her . You could n’t bring yourself to attend her goddamn wedding . You ’ve had it bad for her from the moment you saw her . You let her go because of your stupid insecurities . Because you are so convinced you ’re Hades , doomed , dark , and unredeemable , you have n’t even bothered to read the myth all the way . ”

136714	136744	136745	136745	He	137	“ Giving you flowers is nice . Losing approximately 1.4 billion dollars a year in revenue is , at the very least , a romantic gesture of Shakespearean proportions . ”

137214	137219	137220	137220	He	137	“ Almost four years . ”
137229	137372	137373	137373	he	3433	“ About a month after Hunter and Sailor ’s wedding , my landscaper called me outside , insisting I had to see this . He said it was peculiar . That he did n’t plant the bleeding heart , so he had no idea how the flower had gotten here . His best guess was seeds from a nearby garden blew in the wind and settled here . But I remembered that after I took the flowers from your hair , I put them in a napkin . Later that night , when I arrived home , I went out to the garden to smoke a cigar , found the napkin , and tossed it . It was just the one flower , and my landscaper asked if I wanted to keep it . I immediately thought about your curse — wish , ”
137376	137461	137373	137373	he	3433	“ and said no . He yanked the bleeding heart out from its root the same day . A month later , another bleeding heart grew in the same spot . I had him wrench it out again . This time he went as far as poisoning the soil . On the fourth time , I gave up . A part of me wanted to see how damn stubborn you were . And look at it now . My garden ’s full of them . ”
137495	137526	137472	137472	He	3433	“ So I lived with your bleeding heart . A poisonous reminder of how much I wanted you . Not much later , I found out you were getting married . ”

137544	137645	137536	137536	I	0	“ Everyone has their limits . I draw mine at celebrating my idiocy of pushing you into another man ’s arms . Time went by . I ’d forgotten about you , mostly . The wheels of life kept on spinning , and no matter how fast or slow they went , I barely even remembered I was on board . Then Paxton left , I ’d been appointed CEO of Royal Pipelines , and you showed up at my office , looking for a favor . My initial reaction was to put as much space between us as possible . ”
137646	137654	137655	137655	I	0	“ You did n’t want to feel , ”
137664	137720	137659	137659	He	3437	“ At this point , I was n’t even concerned about the possibility of feeling . I was mainly still annoyed about the damn flowers that kept showing up out of nowhere in my backyard . Like you snuck in at night and planted them there . But then the need for a bride arose … ”
137721	137743	137744	137744	He	3437	“ Yes , and you had multiple candidates to choose from . You canceled the engagement to Minka Gomes . Why ? ”
137752	137758	137744	137744	He	3437	“ She was n’t you . ”
137759	137768	137659	137659	He	3437	“ She could ’ve been pregnant by now . ”
137769	137778	137779	137779	he	3437	“ It was never about having an heir , ”
137793	137810	137779	137779	he	3437	“ Deep down , I was n’t altruistic enough to give a fuck about the lineage . ”
137830	137838	137839	137839	I	0	“ Tell me about the Tourette ’s , ”
137842	137871	137839	137839	I	0	“ Everything , right from the beginning . I ’ve only seen a few videos , but they were enough to show me what you ’ve been through . ”
137872	138024	137839	137839	I	0	“ It started with simple tics , right after my father fired Andrew Senior , and moved to full - blown attacks by the time I ’d gotten back to England after summer break . The lonelier I felt , the worse they became . I ’d been in and out of clinics , and on top of Tourette ’s , I also received comorbid diagnosis of having OCD and ASD . To me , it felt like the end of the world . People think of Tourette ’s as crazy people who shout out obscenities against their own will in rags on the street , OCD as compulsively obsessive maniacs who wash their hands fifteen times an hour , and ASD means I ’m on the autism spectrum . Which basically makes people think I ’m some sort of Rain Man . Good with numbers , dumb at everything else . “
138148	138265	138270	138270	You	3442	” This explained so much . Why Cillian was so fond of his leather gloves — he did n’t like touching strange things , due to his OCD . Why he managed to disconnect from his feelings so efficiently when they became a complication . Why he always cracked his knuckles — to regulate his breaths , to self - soothe . It was a tic . A reminder of what he had to live with . He could n’t switch off who he was . Not fully . No matter how hard he tried . Why he always kept his guard up . Why he ignored me for years instead of caving in to temptation . “

138313	138388	138311	138311	you	3442	” The air between us became thick and charged . He took my hand in his . Such a simple gesture , yet it felt as though he plucked the stars from the sky for me . He pressed my hand against his heart . It raced beneath my palm , thudding violently , desperate to smash the barrier between us and jump into my fist . The strongest hearts have the most scars . “
138397	138406	138407	138407	I	0	” he instructed , drawing a deep breath . “

138548	138559	138544	138546	Also the saddest	3443	” He now lifted two fingers of his other hand . “
138571	138631	138544	138546	Also the saddest	3443	” There was only one finger left curled now . One emotion he still had n’t unveiled . The watch on his wrist said it was five to five . Only five more minutes before Auntie Tilda ’s wish evaporated and we ran out of time to say all the things we wanted to say . My breath hitched . “

I was rolling my suitcase by the river next to our adjoined cabins when I spotted you threading flowers into a crown on the dock . You were smiling at the flowers , so pretty and elusive , and I did n’t want to break the spell by talking to you . Then the wind swiped the flowers everywhere . You did n’t even hesitate . You jumped headfirst into the river and retrieved every single flower that had drifted from the crown , even though you knew it would n’t survive . Why did you do that ? ”
147173	147181	147182	147182	I	0	“ It was my mother ’s birthday , ”

Prior to her wedding , a Rossi bride is to open a wooden chest — carved and made by a witch who lived in my ancestors ’ Italian village — and read three notes written to her by the last Rossi girl to marry . It ’s kind of a good luck charm mixed with a talisman and a bit of fortunetelling . I stole the chest tonight and opened one of the notes , all so I could rush fate . It said that tonight I was going to be kissed by the love of my life , and well … ”
