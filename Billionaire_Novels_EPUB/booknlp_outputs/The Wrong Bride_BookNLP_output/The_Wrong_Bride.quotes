288	293	294	294	I	0	“ Morning , babe , ”
333	360	361	361	I	0	“ Xavier Kingston stole my concept and presented it as his own . He won the project I spent months preparing for — with my ideas ! ”
403	442	395	395	Xavier	23	“ Were n’t you the one who sabotaged him last time ? You punctured his tires so he ’d be late to the meeting when you knew that tardiness was the one thing the client would n’t tolerate . ”
458	506	443	443	Sierra	22	“ If not for that , his company might actually have gotten that resort deal . That was a multi - million dollar deal . Honestly , I ’m kind of disappointed it was so easy to mess with him . Usually he ’s smarter than that . ”
571	582	583	583	Sierra	22	“ So should n’t you have expected him to retaliate ? ”
636	641	642	642	she	22	“ I want revenge , ”
645	663	642	642	she	22	“ That bastard . I ca n’t believe him . You have to help me , Raven . ”
675	682	664	664	I	0	“ Nope . Not going there . ”
762	765	766	766	Sierra	22	“ Raven ? ”
802	808	809	809	I	0	“ It ’s your brother , ”
818	823	824	824	I	0	“ Hi , Ares , ”
852	880	839	839	He	25	“ Raven , I ’m surprised you even picked up . You ’re so hard to reach these days . You ’re even busier than I am . ”
904	909	899	899	him	25	“ What ’s up ? ”
947	976	977	977	I	0	“ Want to go shopping with me ? I need to buy a present for Hannah ’s birthday , and who better to ask for help than you ? ”
1035	1038	1039	1039	I	0	“ Sure , ”
1060	1066	1067	1067	she	22	“ What did he want ? ”
1081	1090	1075	1075	she	22	“ He needs a birthday present for Hannah . ”
1099	1104	1105	1105	she	22	“ Do n’t go , ”
1112	1137	1105	1105	she	22	“ Just do n’t go , Rave . He can figure out what to buy her himself . Why does he need your help ? ”
1138	1143	1144	1144	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
1171	1176	1177	1177	Sierra	22	“ It is n’t , ”
1180	1219	1177	1177	Sierra	22	“ I love my brother , but I love you just as much . You need to stop giving him such easy access to you when each and every time you see Ares , you ’re left heartbroken . ”
1227	1255	1220	1220	I	0	“ I ’m not , Sierra . Ares and I are just friends . We always have been . You ’re seeing things that are n’t there . ”
1265	1282	1258	1258	her	112	“ Lie to yourself all you want , Rave , but you ’re not fooling me . ”
1345	1369	1370	1370	I	0	“ Rave , do n’t you ever wonder what would have happened if you ’d confessed your feelings to him after that night — ”
1380	1440	1370	1370	I	0	“ It would n’t have mattered . It ’s always been Hannah he loved . From the moment she walked into his life , she ’s been all he could see . If I ’d told him how I felt about him , it ’d just have made things awkward between us . I ’d have lost his friendship . ”
1458	1473	1447	1447	her	116	“ Are you really going to stand back and watch Ares marry your sister ? ”
1484	1581	1474	1474	I	0	“ What choice do I have ? They ’ve been together for five years , Sierra . If there was ever a time to make a move , I missed it . They ’re happy together , and I wish them well . If either of them finds out about my feelings , it ’d cost me my friendship with Ares , and it ’d destroy the strained relationship I have with my sister . And what for ? He ’s never seen me as more than a friend , at best . He never will . ”
1587	1689	1584	1584	her	22	“ I do n’t know about that , you know ? I do n’t think Ares is as happy as he convinces himself he is , and I sincerely doubt he sees you as just a friend , Rave . He might not be able to admit it to himself , but there ’s always been something between you two . It was there before Hannah was ever even in the picture , and she was never able to fully erase it . She may have tried , but she ’s never been able to take your place in his life . ”
1748	1805	1806	1806	My	0	“ Raven , I ’m convinced that the only reason they ’re still together is because they know they have no other choice . Just like me , Ares knows he has to marry someone of our Grandma ’s choosing … but the one she initially chose for him was n’t Hannah . It was you . ”
2144	2147	2148	2148	I	0	“ Hi ! ”
2199	2205	2206	2206	I	0	“ Where are we going ? ”
2236	2239	2240	2240	he	25	“ Raven , ”
2273	2283	2264	2264	I	0	“ Why do n’t I ever see you anymore ? ”
2309	2316	2317	2317	My	0	“ I ’ve just been busy . ”
2337	2380	2326	2326	I	0	“ I ’m working really insane hours . I ’ve got so many modeling contracts , and I ’m trying to grow my fashion brand at the same time . Honestly , some days I barely have time to eat or sleep . ”
2402	2445	2397	2397	he	25	“ Do n’t overwork yourself , Rave . Remember to take care of yourself , okay ? You ca n’t always be working . You need to have a social life too . When was the last time you saw your parents ? ”
2501	2510	2511	2511	I	0	“ Sierra was actually just in my office , ”
2515	2524	2511	2511	I	0	“ I do have friends , you know . ”
2552	2562	2563	2563	I	0	“ What are you thinking of buying this year ? ”
2585	2596	2573	2573	He	138	“ What do you think of some jewelry , maybe ? ”
2600	2608	2573	2573	He	138	“ A new statement piece , perhaps ? ”
2633	2650	2609	2609	Ares	25	“ I have n’t heard you laugh in so long , Raven . I missed it . ”
2720	2736	2737	2737	Ares	25	“ A statement piece is basically just the opposite of a dainty piece of jewelry . ”
2742	2751	2752	2752	I	0	“ How about I just let you pick ? ”
2760	2767	2768	2768	He	138	“ Like you do every year ? ”
2896	2935	2880	2880	his	138	“ I should ’ve known taking you to such a public place would ’ve resulted in this . I ’m sorry , Raven . I ’ll handle it . That picture will never see the light of day . ”
2948	3006	2938	2938	my	0	“ It ’s fine . I ’m used to this . I ca n’t stop living my life just because I know I could be photographed at any time . It used to scare me , you know ? Public opinion . Now it ’s just an inconvenience that I ’ve accepted as part of my job . ”
3018	3027	3028	3028	His	25	“ Maybe I should get you some bodyguards . ”
3043	3085	3086	3086	He	25	“ Absolutely not . I ’m never in any danger , Ares . I already do n’t have as much privacy as I wish I had . The last thing I need is someone in my personal space at all times . ”
3171	3175	3176	3176	he	25	“ Mr. Windsor , ”
3187	3190	3176	3176	he	25	“ Raven . ”
3232	3259	3260	3260	Ares	25	“ Raven , wow . It ’s such an honor to meet you . My name is Andy , and I ’ll be assisting you today . ”
3292	3304	3305	3305	he	25	“ We ’ll ask for your assistance when we need it , ”
3325	3330	3331	3331	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
3351	3387	3341	3341	Ares	25	“ He ’s unprofessional . The way he looked at you just now ? What was that ? First , we get photographed the second we step out of the car , and now this ? ”
3407	3410	3411	3411	I	0	“ Ares , ”
3414	3488	3411	3411	I	0	“ I ’m not the little girl you used to know anymore . I was named this year ’s highest paid model , and I ’m a brand ambassador for many of the products sold in this mall . It ’s not surprising that he ’d recognize me . If anything , his response was really quite mild . I ’m pretty sure my face is on a large banner advertising this mall . ”
3489	3492	3493	3493	Ares	25	“ Mild ? ”
3496	3505	3493	3493	Ares	25	“ Mild ? He practically leered at you . ”
3520	3573	3506	3506	I	0	“ How do you deal with being around Hannah ? I might be well known , but I ’m pretty sure Hannah is even more famous . Models generally are n’t as popular as A - list actresses . How do you deal with the attention she gets if this annoys you ? ”
3584	3626	3574	3574	Ares	25	“ I think you underestimate your popularity . Besides , your sister has bodyguards around at all times , so I do n’t need to worry about her . You , on the other hand ? You ’re a stubborn one . ”
3724	3731	3732	3732	Ares	25	“ How about something like that ? ”
3790	3795	3796	3796	he	25	“ Try it on , ”
3805	3830	3800	3800	I	0	“ Oh no , I ca n’t . This is for Hannah . I can tell she ’d love it without trying it on . ”
3870	3893	3863	3863	he	25	“ If you like it , I ’ll buy it for you , Raven . We can find something else for Hannah . ”
3907	3919	3899	3899	he	25	“ Your birthday is coming up soon as well , remember ? ”
3920	3926	3927	3927	I	0	“ It ’s too much , ”
3941	3958	3959	3959	Ares	25	“ But thank you . She ’ll love it . You should definitely buy her this . ”
3975	3978	3979	3979	he	25	“ Hey , ”
3986	4059	3979	3979	he	25	“ Are we okay , Rave ? I feel like you ’ve been avoiding me lately , you know ? Is it the pressure Hannah has put on you with the wedding ? I know you ’ve been doing a lot of the prep that she was supposed to do . Just tell me if it ’s too much , okay ? You know I hate it when you suddenly go quiet . ”
4072	4090	4060	4060	I	0	“ We ’re fine , Ares . I ’ve just been really busy , that ’s all . ”
4181	4198	4199	4199	Mom	32	“ I ’m not sure we can seat the Astors that close to Ares ’s brothers , ”
4202	4246	4199	4199	Mom	32	“ We definitely must invite them . Their family is on par with the Windsors , after all … but we can not seat them that closely together . If I recall correctly , Adrian Astor strongly dislikes Ares ’s brother , Lexington . ”
4256	4263	4247	4247	I	0	“ Adrian does n’t like Lex ? ”
4310	4332	4294	4294	He	34	“ Yes , that ’s what I heard . From what I understand , Adrian does not appreciate Lexington ’s playfulness . ”
4376	4387	4388	4388	Mom	32	“ Fine , we ’ll just seat them further apart . ”
4409	4416	4417	4417	Mom	32	“ Everything has to be perfect , ”
4420	4430	4417	4417	Mom	32	“ Hannah has waited so long for this day . ”
4440	4461	4462	4462	Mom	32	“ She ’s postponed the wedding three times , Mom . I do n’t think she ’s all that impatient . ”
4473	4594	4470	4470	her	32	“ That ’s because her work is demanding , Raven . You would never understand what it ’s like to be an actress . All you need to do is stand still and look pretty all day . It is n’t the same for Hannah . She does n’t get to go home after one measly photoshoot . She ’s away from home for weeks on end , working on sets that are n’t even remotely comfortable . Do you really think she wanted to postpone the wedding ? She did that because she had no choice . You might not get it , but the least you can do is keep silent if you have nothing good to say . ”
4834	4839	4840	4840	Mom	32	“ I ’m sorry , ”
4847	4947	4840	4840	Mom	32	“ The wedding has put so much pressure on me , and I took it out on you . I ’m sorry , Raven . You understand , do n’t you ? This wedding means a lot to both of our families . This merger has been years in the making , and once this wedding is behind us , we can finalize the remaining paperwork and leave the merged company in Hannah and Ares ’s hands . The Windsors refuse to proceed any further until the wedding is over , and your father and I need their funding . ”
4955	4962	4948	4948	I	0	“ I get it , Mom . ”
4969	5003	4963	4963	She	171	“ You ’ve always been such a sweet girl , Raven . Hannah and I are both lucky to have you . I definitely could n’t have done any of this without you . ”
5073	5090	5091	5091	Mom	32	“ I ca n’t believe my little girl is going to be someone ’s wife soon , ”
5113	5199	5094	5094	she	32	“ When your sister was little , I was n’t sure she ’d even live long enough to fall in love . There were so many things I never thought she ’d experience , yet here she is , an international superstar , about to marry one of the most eligible billionaires in the world . In the process , she ’s taking care of both Dad and me too , allowing us to retire at last , knowing our company is in safe hands . ”
5242	5251	5252	5252	I	0	“ She ’ll make for a beautiful bride , ”
5268	5287	5256	5256	Mom	32	“ How is the wedding dress coming along ? Were you able to make the alterations Hannah requested ? ”
5324	5328	5329	5329	Mom	32	“ Of course . ”
5332	5407	5329	5329	Mom	32	“ It ’s nice that she asked you to make her dress for her . It ’s such a nice way to include you . I thought for sure that she ’d have wanted a famous brand instead , but I suppose this ’ll help you gain traction . Once the world sees Hannah in one of your dresses , all her celebrity friends will follow suit . She ’s a trendsetter like that . ”
5415	5487	5408	5408	I	0	“ I ’ve won several fashion awards , Mom . I ’ve had a two - year waiting list for any of my couture wedding gowns ever since I launched my first line , and that list has only gotten longer since Alanna Sinclair got married in one of my gowns . My fashion brand is well - established and no less prestigious than some of the older brands out there . ”
5502	5508	5509	5509	she	32	“ Oh , of course , ”
5527	5582	5515	5515	she	32	“ Anyway , we need to make sure these are hand delivered three days before the wedding . Everything about this wedding must be secretive . If the paparazzi show up , it ’ll ruin Hannah ’s day . Why do n’t you double check that everything is well with the courier we booked ? ”
5591	5594	5595	5595	I	0	“ Sure , ”
5603	5610	5595	5595	I	0	“ I ’ll do it tomorrow . ”
5619	5627	5611	5611	Mom	32	“ You are n’t staying for dinner ? ”
5628	5637	5638	5638	Mom	32	“ No . I ’m shooting early tomorrow . ”
5641	5661	5638	5638	Mom	32	“ Oh , good . Do n’t want to look too fat in your maid of honor dress either . ”
5852	5855	5842	5842	I	0	“ Sweetheart ? ”
5868	5878	5864	5864	he	181	“ Let me walk you out , sweet girl . ”
5919	5926	5927	5927	he	181	“ I love you , Raven , ”
5930	5947	5927	5927	he	181	“ Your mother does too , but she just is n’t as good at conveying that . ”
5958	5969	5948	5948	I	0	“ She has no problem conveying her love for Hannah . ”
5983	5987	5988	5988	he	181	“ I know , ”
5991	6065	5988	5988	he	181	“ Mom feels the need to be so vocal about it because of how rough Hannah had it when she was young . Your mother thinks that she can make up for all the pain Hannah endured when she was sick by showering her with love now . It ’s more for her than it is for Hannah , and it does n’t mean that she does n’t love you just as much . ”
6124	6130	6109	6109	I	0	“ Love you , Dad . ”
6131	6167	6119	6119	my	0	“ You drive safe , okay ? Send me a text message when you get home . I know how to use those emotions things now . I ’ll send you a thumbs up back . ”
6168	6171	6172	6172	I	0	“ Emojis ? ”
6177	6183	6172	6172	I	0	“ That ’s the ones . ”
6184	6210	6119	6119	my	0	“ Good for you , Dad . I ’ll send you an emoji in the shape of a house when I get home , okay ? ”
6211	6219	6220	6220	He	181	“ It ’ll be our secret language . ”
6334	6375	6321	6321	I	0	“ Hannah , you promised me we ’d go together . This is the third time this month you ’re canceling on me at the very last second . Could n’t you at least have given me some adequate notice ? ”
6383	6438	6380	6380	Hannah	26	“ I ’m sorry , Ares . I really wanted to be there tonight , you know that . I wanted to support Raven and be there with you , but I just ca n’t get away . I need to retake some scenes , and it just has n’t been going too well . ”
6439	6480	6489	6489	her	26	“ It ’s always the same excuses , Hannah . I ’m trying to be as supportive as I can be , but you ’re making it really difficult . I ca n’t always be the one who makes compromises . ”
6481	6485	6486	6486	she	26	“ I know , ”
6493	6502	6489	6489	her	26	“ I ’ll make it up to you . ”
6503	6561	6489	6489	her	26	“ Is this because you do n’t want to be seen or photographed with me ? Hannah , we ’re getting married in a month . Do n’t forget about our agreement . The moment we ’re married , we ’re taking our relationship public , so what ’s the harm in us being captured together tonight ? ”
6562	6616	6617	6617	I	0	“ Ares , it is n’t that . I promise , it is n’t . I ’m taking so much time off for the wedding that I just really want to work extra hard to make up for it . I do n’t want to be the reason we fall behind on schedule . ”
6631	6636	6637	6637	I	0	“ I get it , ”
6765	6774	6775	6775	I	0	“ She is n’t coming , is she ? ”
6826	6829	6817	6817	I	0	“ Nope . ”
6830	6875	6876	6876	I	0	“ It ’s going to be annoying for you to go without a date . You know what the women are like at these types of events . You ’ll just get harassed all night long . I wish I could ’ve made it . ”
6881	6906	6876	6876	I	0	“ It ’s fine . You have an early flight to catch , do n’t you ? Besides , you hate the entertainment industry . ”
7007	7013	7014	7014	I	0	“ I ’ll be fine , ”
7019	7044	7014	7014	I	0	“ It ’s just a fashion show . I ’ve sponsored plenty of those . I ’ll just put in an appearance and leave . ”
7050	7096	7045	7045	Lex	35	“ Raven will be there , so you ’ll be fine . She ’s the star of the show tonight . I do n’t know how , but she just keeps getting more and more beautiful . I really wish I could ’ve made it . ”
7137	7150	7132	7132	he	1731	“ How do you know she ’s going to be there tonight ? ”
7190	7198	7180	7180	He	1731	“ I spoke to her earlier today . ”
7226	7236	7217	7217	Lex	35	“ Tell Raven I said hi , will you ? ”
7616	7620	7598	7598	she	24	“ Mr. Windsor ! ”
7688	7698	7699	7699	Jonas	42	“ Several of your models walked our stage today , ”
7704	7771	7699	7699	Jonas	42	“ Windsor Media truly is a powerhouse . Is there anything you do n’t own ? You ’ve got your hands on several popular magazines , one newspaper , the fashion industry , and , of course , your production studio . I ’m not sure how you do it all . I ’m honored you were able to make time to attend my event today . ”
7836	7844	7845	7845	I	0	“ I ’m afraid I ca n’t . ”
7876	7880	7881	7881	I	0	“ Excuse me , ”

7992	7999	8000	8000	I	0	“ There you are , Raven , ”
8030	8034	8035	8035	he	234	“ Mr. Windsor , ”
8077	8090	8091	8091	he	234	“ We spoke recently regarding a script I sent to Windsor Media , ”
8185	8208	8209	8209	I	0	“ All I remember is hearing you propositioning Raven . It ’s interesting , because you can not afford to offend her . ”
8213	8281	8209	8209	I	0	“ You want to pay her more than she earns in a year for one date ? She ’s the highest paid model in the world , and you ? Well , I ’m not sure who you are . I do know you can not afford to come within five feet of her , and if you do … I ’ll make you pay the price . ”
8314	8320	8321	8321	he	239	“ I did n’t know , ”
8337	8346	8328	8328	I	0	“ Now you do , so fuck off . ”
8377	8387	8388	8388	She	24	“ Still convinced you do n’t need a bodyguard ? ”
8402	8418	8399	8399	her	24	“ Ares . I was n’t in any danger , so what ’s the point ? ”
8429	8436	8419	8419	I	0	“ How often does this happen ? ”
8437	8443	8444	8444	she	24	“ It ’s super rare , ”
8477	8497	8466	8466	she	24	“ You should n’t be left alone at these types of events . You did n’t bring a date ? ”
8640	8664	8631	8631	His	43	“ No . It ’s just me tonight . My agent will be joining me shortly , but he ’s backstage right now . ”
8677	8706	8707	8707	She	24	“ I never understood it , you know ? How come you ’ve never been in a serious relationship ? How does a woman like you stay single ? ”
8721	8762	8707	8707	She	24	“ I just have n’t found a guy that can keep me captivated . I ’m not willing to settle for anything short of complete devotion . I want epic love , and I ’m willing to wait for it . ”

8829	8835	8836	8836	she	24	“ It ’s my agent , ”
8840	8863	8836	8836	she	24	“ I guess it ’s time for an endless amount of supposedly necessary socializing . I ’ll catch you later , okay ? ”
8982	8989	8990	8990	I	0	“ Give this more news coverage , ”
9271	9276	9277	9278	my secretary	261	“ Bradford Manson called , ”
9285	9323	9280	9280	Dom	46	“ He wanted to inquire about the script he sent in . Based on your notes , it appears like we ’re ready to okay the funding for his project . Should I put that into motion ? ”
9333	9336	9337	9337	I	0	“ No , ”
9354	9373	9347	9347	he	262	“ He ’s a piece of shit unworthy of being stuck on the bottom of her fucking shoe . ”
9374	9377	9378	9378	Dom	46	“ What ? ”
9390	9445	9383	9383	I	0	“ Forget it . I never want to hear that fucker ’s name again . We wo n’t work with him again , and let it be known that any actor or actress that works with him will never work with Windsor Media again . The same goes for anyone that gives him funding . ”
9451	9474	9446	9446	Dom	46	“ What did the poor sucker do for you to give him the Kiss of Death ? He ’ll never work again . ”
9539	9586	9534	9534	I	0	“ I do n’t give a fuck if he never works again . He should ’ve thought of that before he let his mouth run . Let ’s see where he ’s going to get the money to pay for much of anything . Fucking asshole . ”
9636	9643	9644	9644	I	0	“ Come to think of it , ”
9655	9702	9703	9703	Dom	46	“ There ’s a store manager called Andy . He works in our flagship mall . I want him fired . He works for one of the jewelry stores . I forgot what it ’s called . Whatever Hannah ’s favorite brand is , that one . ”
9709	9746	9703	9703	Dom	46	“ If it ’s one of the malls , then that ’s real estate , and it falls under Sierra ’s jurisdiction . You know she does n’t like it when we interfere with her business . ”
9762	9798	9759	9759	He	46	” and often mistaken for my bodyguard , yet he cowers at the thought of my sister . I suppose I ca n’t blame him . My little sister is somewhat unhinged , after all . “
9849	9863	9864	9864	He	31	” Dom ’s eyes widen , a hint of anger in his eyes . “
9869	9878	9864	9864	He	31	” He grits his teeth and nods resolutely . “
9884	10022	9879	9879	I	0	” I watch as he marches out and suppress my smile . It is n’t just my family and I that love Raven . It ’s everyone she comes in touch with . She ’s so easy to love , and the entire world sees it but her . I glance out the window , hesitating for a moment . I genuinely do n’t like the idea of her going around unprotected . What would have happened if I had n’t been there last night ? What if fucking Brad had n’t taken no for an answer ? I grab my phone and stare down at it , swallowing down my pride as I call the one man I fucking despise . He might be an asshole , but he ’s the best at what he does . “
10026	10044	10023	10024	Silas Sinclair	43	” he says . I grit my teeth , annoyed at the mere sound of his voice . “
10050	10051	10047	10048	Ares Windsor	25	” “
10070	10077	10078	10078	I	0	” I fucking hate this man . “
10098	10099	10084	10084	I	0	” “
10103	10166	10084	10084	I	0	” he asks , intrigued . I clench my jaw as memories of Raven on his arm come to mind . For years , the two of them were seen together , dating on and off again . I wish there was someone else better suited for the favor I need , but this fucker truly is the best of the best . “
10244	10254	10239	10242	someone to step in	275	” He chuckles darkly , the sound fucking irritating . “
10277	10295	10296	10298	Raven Du Pont	48	” I look up at my ceiling , an inexplicable hint of nerves running down my spine . “
10300	10308	10296	10298	Raven Du Pont	48	” He falls silent for a moment . “
10321	10330	10331	10331	I	0	” I close my eyes and inhale deeply . “
10334	10335	10331	10331	I	0	” “

10368	10388	10362	10362	you	276	” I hesitate . Silas fucking Sinclair . He knows how much a favor from a Windsor is worth . “
10393	10394	10362	10362	you	276	” “
10408	10415	10406	10406	Windsor	24	” Fuck . This fucking asshole . “
10426	10437	10438	10438	I	0	” I snap . He laughs , the sound grating . “
10464	10465	10446	10446	My	0	” “
10477	10478	10467	10467	you	276	” “

10505	10525	10495	10495	You	276	” He laughs again , and never before have I been this tempted to punch someone in the face . “
10528	10532	10495	10495	You	276	” he admits . “
10539	10540	10533	10533	Alanna	38	” “
10543	10550	10533	10533	Alanna	38	” I say through gritted teeth . “

10574	10578	10579	10579	Raven	24	” he says . “
10601	10608	10583	10593	some of the most skilled and ruthless men I ’ve got	287	” Then that fucker laughs again . “
10661	10678	10658	10658	yourself	276	” Then he hangs up on me , leaving me fucking fuming . Fucking piece of shit .
10933	10936	10937	10937	I	0	“ Ares ! ”
11052	11055	11056	11056	I	0	“ Arthur . ”

11106	11120	11103	11103	I	0	“ Work has been busy , but I ’ve freed up the weekend . ”

11281	11286	11287	11287	she	26	“ It ’s beautiful , ”
11290	11299	11287	11287	she	26	“ Can you help me put it on ? ”
11316	11322	11323	11323	I	0	“ Looks stunning on you , ”
11348	11388	11340	11340	She	26	“ I was wondering why there were paparazzi photos of Raven and you floating around . The two of you being spotted at a jewelry store sparked some really weird rumors . Turns out it was because of this . ”
11596	11599	11587	11587	she	24	“ Ares . ”
11625	11637	11638	11638	She	24	“ Why are you sitting here all by yourself , Cupcake ? ”
11655	11671	11638	11638	She	24	“ Are you really going to call me that for the rest of our lives ? ”
11675	11701	11672	11672	I	0	“ I still vividly remember your cupcake keychain , the t - shirt , the pin on your bag . You were really into cupcakes . ”
11716	11757	11713	11713	her	24	“ I was fourteen , and I was going through a phase , okay ? I guess I should be glad we did n’t meet when I was going through my emo phase . That would ’ve been a disaster . ”
11781	11789	11790	11790	I	0	“ You did n’t answer my question , ”
11794	11812	11790	11790	I	0	“ Why are you sitting here by yourself ? Should n’t you be celebrating with your sister ? ”
11824	11828	11813	11813	She	24	“ I tried . ”
11975	11992	11993	11993	She	24	“ I ’m sorry , Cupcake . I guess we ’re in the same boat tonight . ”
11998	12024	11995	11995	her	24	“ She gets to see us whenever she wants , but it ’s harder for her to see her friends , so I get it . ”
12045	12053	12054	12054	She	24	“ Show me what you ’re drawing . ”
12075	12094	12095	12095	She	24	“ I ’m thinking of trying various shades of nude with heavy beading . Form fitting but classy . ”
12110	12119	12095	12095	She	24	“ You ’re amazing , you know that ? ”
12173	12208	12209	12209	I	0	“ Hey , I ’ve got something for you . I know it ’s a bit early and your birthday is n’t for another month , but I thought you ’d want this now . ”
12278	12312	12313	12313	she	24	“ Ares ! This tablet is n’t even out yet ! I ’ve got it on pre - order , and it wo n’t release for another six months . How did you — “
12333	12352	12313	12313	she	24	“ Wow . You ... how ? ! This is n’t just … they do n’t customize these ! ”
12468	12480	12481	12481	I	0	“ I know someone who knows someone , who knows someone , ”
12511	12516	12517	12517	she	323	“ I love it ! ”
12534	12551	12517	12517	she	323	“ I ca n’t believe you did this for me . You hate picking out presents ! ”
12557	12575	12554	12554	my	0	“ No , I do n’t . I ’ve always picked out yours , every single year . ”
12580	12586	12576	12576	She	323	“ That was n’t Dom ? ”
12587	12590	12591	12591	I	0	“ Dom ? ”
12596	12616	12591	12591	I	0	“ Has that fucker been taking credit for all the gifts I picked out for you over the years ? ”
12629	12674	12617	12617	She	323	“ No , I suppose I was just making baseless assumptions . I love this , Ares . I truly , truly love this . This is my favorite present ever . I ca n’t wait to draw my next few designs on it . ”
12691	12732	12733	12733	She	323	“ Do you ever relax , though ? You ’re always working , Raven . I do n’t know many people who work more than I do , but you ’re definitely one of them . It is n’t healthy . ”
12737	12754	12733	12733	She	323	“ It ’s fine . Working keeps my mind occupied . I prefer it that way . ”
12763	12772	12755	12755	I	0	“ What is it you ’re running from ? ”
12789	12807	12780	12780	her	24	“ Hey , she seems to love the necklace . I told you , did n’t I ? ”
12848	12858	12859	12859	I	0	“ Yes , you picked well . Thank you . ”
12934	12961	12962	12962	I	0	“ You really do need to take a break every once in a while , Raven . Let me take you to the beach tomorrow morning , ”
12966	12975	12976	12976	She	24	“ Do you still enjoy watching the sunrise ? ”
12983	12990	12976	12976	She	24	“ You ’re staying over tonight ? ”
12994	13006	12976	12976	She	24	“ I figured it ’d be easiest if I ’m drinking . ”
13037	13062	13063	13063	I	0	“ I think I ’ll head back to my apartment tonight . That way , one of Hannah ’s friends can have my room . ”

13546	13550	13551	13551	I	0	“ Rough week , ”
13555	13575	13551	13551	I	0	“ Come on . I ’ll have the staff bring out some chocolate cookies that I baked earlier today . ”
13576	13579	13580	13580	I	0	“ Wow , ”
13583	13609	13580	13580	I	0	“ It ’s true love . You love me , do n’t you , Grandma ? I always knew that I was secretly your favorite . ”
13734	13740	13741	13741	she	44	“ Your heart is aching , ”
13791	13807	13817	13817	she	44	“ Just tired , Grams . I think I ’ve just been working too hard . ”
13808	13816	13817	13817	she	44	“ You ’ve been running too hard , ”
13971	13981	13968	13968	she	110	“ Rave ! You grandma - stealing little bitch ! ”
14011	14035	14038	14038	her	22	“ I thought you came over to hang out with me , but really , you ’re here for Grandma . How rude . ”
14049	14054	14055	14055	I	0	“ Those are mine ! ”
14058	14064	14055	14055	I	0	“ They ’re my cookies ! ”
14079	14092	14093	14093	She	22	“ Sierra , I swear to God . Give me the cookies ! ”
14109	14121	14096	14096	she	22	“ You stole my grandmother , so I get your cookies . ”
14137	14140	14141	14141	I	0	“ Grandma ! ”
14178	14200	14170	14170	his	25	“ How much do you think I ’ll get paid if I sell this footage of a supermodel fighting for cookies ? ”
14201	14210	14211	14211	I	0	“ Oh , no , you do n’t ! ”
14241	14271	14222	14222	He	25	” and towers above me — not that that ’ll stop me . I jump up and reach for his phone , annoyed when I ca n’t reach it . “
14277	14281	14222	14222	He	25	” I snap . “
14285	14350	14351	14351	I	0	” he says , laughing . I narrow my eyes at him and grab his shoulders before jumping up , wrapping my legs around his waist as I reach for his phone . He ’s caught off guard and turns us around , pushing me against the wall roughly , his eyes on mine . I blink slowly , suddenly realizing what I did . “
14355	14448	14351	14351	I	0	” I say , acting nonchalant as I delete the video from his phone . My smile melts off my face when the next photo in his gallery pops up . It ’s a photo of Hannah in bed , most of her body hidden behind the covers , and a bright smile on her face . I recognize the room she ’s in instantly . This photo was taken at my parents ’ house , probably on her birthday . I push against Ares , and he lets me down carefully . “
14451	14467	14351	14351	I	0	” I tell him as I hand back his phone . He frowns in confusion . “
14472	14527	14533	14533	his	359	” I shake my head and walk past him , toward Sierra ’s house . She follows me quietly . For a few moments , it felt like we were back in our childhood , before Hannah and Ares started dating . It felt easy and uncomplicated , but reality is anything but that . “
14536	14544	14530	14530	you	358	” Sierra asks , her voice soft . “
14553	14569	14570	14570	I	0	” She grabs my hand and entwines our fingers as we walk to her house . “
14576	14582	14570	14570	I	0	” I shake my head . “

14628	14668	14591	14591	You	358	” I nod and tighten my grip on her hand . With the wedding approaching so rapidly , perhaps that ’s exactly what I need . One night to let loose and force myself to put an end to this .
14675	14680	14681	14681	Sierra	22	“ I hate you ! ”
14692	14700	14701	14701	Raven	24	“ Do n’t you hate him too ? ”
14704	14707	14708	14708	she	24	“ Yes , ”

14933	14937	14938	14938	Sierra	22	“ Open it ! ”
14948	14961	14941	14941	her	22	“ If I do , will you stop being mad at me ? ”
15019	15028	15029	15029	she	24	“ Why wo n’t you let us in ? ”
15043	15054	15055	15055	I	0	“ I will , sweetheart . Of course I will . ”
15100	15104	15105	15105	I	0	“ Come on , ”
15115	15122	15123	15123	she	24	“ I do n’t wanna walk , ”

15288	15298	15281	15281	Raven	24	“ I ’ve kept secrets from you for years . ”
15299	15307	15308	15308	Her	24	“ Oh yeah ? Tell me one . ”
15324	15355	15308	15308	Her	24	“ Every time I see you wearing those , I wonder what they ’d look like if your dick is hard . Would I be able to see every contour ? ”
15375	15379	15371	15371	her	24	“ You what ? ”
15432	15444	15445	15445	she	24	“ Do n’t ask questions you do n’t want answers to , ”
15456	15466	15467	15467	I	0	“ I ’m going to check up on Sierra , ”
15530	15533	15534	15534	I	0	“ Sierra ? ”
15674	15677	15678	15678	I	0	“ Rave ? ”

15754	15757	15758	15758	she	24	“ No , ”
15765	15769	15758	15758	she	24	“ Come sit . ”
15779	15803	15770	15770	I	0	“ What ’s up , Rave ? Why do you seem so upset tonight ? Why does Sierra insist that she hates me ? ”
15816	15821	15810	15810	her	24	“ You wanna know ? ”
15883	15891	15863	15863	I	0	“ What are you doing , Cupcake ? ”
15892	15901	15935	15935	herself	24	“ I want to sit here , Ares . ”
15902	15907	15935	15935	herself	24	“ You ca n’t . ”
15908	15921	15935	15935	herself	24	“ I know , but I ’m going to do it anyway . ”
15922	15932	15933	15933	She	24	“ Raven , how much did you drink today ? ”
15972	15976	15977	15977	she	24	“ Not enough , ”
15980	16002	15977	15977	she	24	“ I ’ve never had the courage I needed , and I think I ’ll always regret it , you know ? ”
16040	16048	16049	16049	She	24	“ What is it you ’ll regret ? ”
16060	16084	16051	16051	her	24	“ Not going after the man I love . If I had , would things be different now ? Would I be happier ? ”

16132	16136	16137	16137	she	24	“ Oh Silas , ”
16156	16202	16203	16203	I	0	“ No . Silas and Alanna are still very much part of my life , and I love them both dearly . I think I might love Alanna more than I love Silas , you know ? She ’s crazy in the very best way . ”
16214	16220	16203	16203	I	0	“ So who is he ? ”
16231	16242	16228	16228	her	24	“ You would n’t believe me if I told you . ”
16243	16265	16266	16266	She	24	“ Someone I know , then . Do n’t tell me it ’s one of my brothers ? Is it Lexington ? ”
16275	16284	16285	16285	she	24	“ Should I fuck your brother , Ares ? ”
16298	16311	16285	16285	she	24	“ You will do no such thing if you value his life . ”
16355	16361	16362	16362	I	0	“ Come on , sweetheart , ”
16368	16392	16362	16362	I	0	“ You should go to sleep . You ’ve had far too much to drink , and you ’ll regret your actions tomorrow . ”
16393	16398	16399	16399	she	24	“ I wo n’t , ”
16403	16419	16399	16399	she	24	“ The only things I ’ve ever regretted were the things I did n’t do . ”
16471	16479	16468	16468	she	24	“ What are you doing , Rave ? ”
16480	16486	16487	16487	She	24	“ Something I should n’t . ”
16512	16518	16519	16519	I	0	“ This needs to stop , ”
16523	16552	16519	16519	I	0	“ It does n’t matter how drunk you are , Rave . This is n’t right . I ’m your sister ’s fiancé , for God ’s sake . ”
16553	16556	16557	16557	she	24	“ Yeah , ”
16560	16568	16557	16557	she	24	“ But you should have been mine . ”
16623	16638	16611	16611	she	24	“ I want this t - shirt , Ares . Can I have it ? ”
16647	16654	16639	16639	I	0	“ I … what ? Why ? ”
16682	16687	16670	16670	She	24	“ Fuck , Raven , ”
16724	16758	16708	16708	I	0	“ Cupcake , you ’re really testing my patience tonight . I ’m trying , okay ? I ’m trying to be kind and patient , but you ’re taking this too far . ”
16766	16802	16761	16761	her	24	“ Ugh , Ares . Do you know how many people have seen me naked ? Calm down . I walk around naked or barely dressed before every show I do . It ’s cool . ”
16811	16833	16803	16803	I	0	“ And do you sit in people ’s laps like this , Rave ? You know exactly what you ’re doing . ”
16839	16863	16834	16834	She	24	“ Should I find someone else ’s lap to sit in ? Maybe I should ’ve gone home with John , after all . ”
16864	16874	16875	16875	She	24	“ John ? Your agent went out with you ? ”
16878	16888	16875	16875	She	24	“ I should ’ve let him take me home . ”
16889	16901	16902	16902	I	0	“ And what would ’ve happened if he had , Rave ? ”
16909	16931	16902	16902	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I guess I ’d get some good orgasms and a great fuck out of it . ”
16966	17004	16960	16960	I	0	“ What the fuck is wrong with you , Rave ? You ’ve been prim and proper all your fucking life , and now you suddenly want to get laid ? What the fuck is going on ? ”
17024	17059	17009	17009	her	24	“ I asked for your t - shirt , Ares . I did n’t ask you to fuck me … though , based on how hard you are , I suspect you want to . ”
17060	17076	17077	17077	She	24	“ If I give you my t - shirt , will you go to bed ? ”
17080	17138	17077	17077	She	24	“ Fine . Fine , Rave . I ’ll give you my t - shirt , but this ends here , okay ? Stop provoking me . I do n’t know what ’s gotten into you , but every bit of this is inappropriate , and knowing you , you ’re going to regret this tomorrow morning . ”
17160	17188	17142	17142	she	24	“ Fuck . You ’re fucking naked . Why the fuck are n’t you wearing any underwear , Raven ? Fuck . This … this is n’t … ”
17217	17224	17225	17225	she	24	“ I do n’t like underwear , ”
17343	17347	17348	17348	I	0	“ Come on , ”
17352	17357	17348	17348	I	0	“ Put this on . ”
17391	17395	17396	17396	I	0	“ Bed time , ”
17406	17418	17400	17400	She	24	“ Does no part of you want me even a little ? ”
17440	17443	17444	17444	I	0	“ No , ”
17449	17517	17444	17444	I	0	“ The friction from you moving on top of me made me hard , yeah , but I do n’t want you , Raven . I ’ll never want you . I ’m not sure what you ’re thinking , but you need to stop . Do you know how much your actions tonight would hurt your sister ? Fuck , it ’s hurting me , Rave . ”
17558	17583	17550	17550	She	24	“ Fuck , Cupcake . I ’m so fucking sorry . I ’m sorry . I did n’t mean it , not at all . ”
17584	17587	17588	17588	she	24	“ No , ”
17596	17622	17588	17588	she	24	“ I ’m sorry , Ares . I just … I thought … I ’m sorry . I - I … I need to go . ”
17655	17692	17640	17640	I	0	“ You ’re not going anywhere , Cupcake . Not tonight . It ’s okay , Rave . We ’ve all had our messy drunken nights , and this is no different . I ’m sorry . ”
17693	17701	17702	17702	she	24	“ Not as much as I am , ”
17705	17728	17702	17702	she	24	“ I should ’ve known better . Of course you ’d never want me . You ’ll never want anyone but Hannah . ”
17787	17801	17802	17802	I	0	“ Come on , Cupcake . Let ’s go to sleep , okay ? ”
17826	17867	17868	17868	She	24	“ Just sleep , Rave . We ’ll forget this happened tomorrow , okay ? I suspect you ’ve drunk so much you wo n’t be able to remember , anyway . Let ’s just go to bed , huh ? ”
17936	17939	17940	17940	I	0	“ Raven ? ”
17964	17967	17946	17947	Grandma Anne	44	“ Ares ? ”
18035	18040	18041	18041	he	25	“ Morning , drunkard , ”
18066	18069	18070	18070	he	25	“ Grandma , ”
18085	18092	18079	18079	His	25	“ What are you doing here ? ”
18157	18161	18162	18162	she	44	“ Big night ? ”
18169	18193	18162	18162	she	44	“ Sierra and I , um … we drank way too much , and Ares ended up having to take care of us . ”
18243	18248	18249	18249	Ares	25	“ Where is Sierra ? ”
18266	18286	18287	18287	Grandma	44	“ In my bed . Best to let her sleep a bit longer . She was really quite drunk . ”
18290	18331	18287	18287	Grandma	44	“ How about you two get some more rest too ? You look … disheveled . I will have some breakfast sent over for the three of you later . You can just warm it up once Sierra wakes up . ”
18350	18356	18357	18357	I	0	“ I should go too , ”
18385	18389	18390	18390	Ares	25	“ Hold on , ”
18408	18414	18415	18415	he	25	“ Come here , Raven , ”
18492	18523	18482	18482	he	25	“ How do you feel , Rave ? I ’ve never seen you as drunk as you were last night . Can you even remember half the shit you did ? ”
18533	18536	18537	18537	I	0	“ Ares , ”
18540	18607	18537	18537	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry . Nothing I can say will make up for how I treated you last night . I ’m so ashamed of my actions , and I ca n’t even imagine how angry you must be . I ’m so sorry , truly . I do n’t know what I was thinking . I never should ’ve … I ca n’t believe … ”
18617	18653	18608	18608	He	394	“ Not so confident today , are you ? Last night you were all too happy to sit in my lap and demand to wear my t - shirt , getting naked in the process . ”
18667	18678	18679	18679	I	0	“ Do you really need to remind me of that ? ”
18687	18725	18684	18684	He	394	“ It ’s okay , Rave . I ’m not mad , I ’m just confused . You ’ve never acted that way before , and definitely never around me . What ’s going on with you ? ”
18737	18766	18726	18726	Ares	25	“ I mean , I get being drunk and wanting to go home with someone , wanting that thrill , the release . But that is n’t you . ”
18771	18787	18788	18788	I	0	“ You do n’t know me as well as you think you do , Ares , ”
18799	18822	18788	18788	I	0	“ It ’s just been a while since I got laid , and I wanted it badly . Anyone would ’ve done . ”
18834	18850	18825	18825	his	25	“ Do you do this often ? Get drunk ? One - night - stands ? ”
18862	18890	18825	18825	his	25	“ Does it matter ? I ’m an adult , Ares . I know what I ’m doing . I do n’t need you to lecture me . ”
18891	18984	18985	18985	I	0	“ Raven , you need to be careful . You ca n’t just give anyone access to you . Do n’t even dream of ever going home with someone you do n’t know , you hear me ? It ’s hardly safe for a regular girl , but you ? You ’re the object of so many men ’s desires . Who knows what those fucked up perverts are fantasizing about as they collect photos of you . I ’ve seen the comments on all your posts . It is n’t safe . ”
18997	19007	18985	18985	I	0	“ Are you going to tell Hannah about this ? ”
19023	19108	19017	19017	his	395	“ How am I supposed to tell her I had her sister naked in my lap ? I know you did n’t have any bad intentions and that you were just drunk , but Hannah would n’t see it that way . It ’s best not to tell her anything at all . I ’ve had my fair share of drunken , embarrassing moments . You ’re entitled to yours . I just want you to promise me you wo n’t do this again . ”
19109	19114	19115	19115	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
19119	19144	19115	19115	I	0	“ I wo n’t ever look at you that way again . I wo n’t come near you . I ’ll keep my distance . ”
19145	19148	19149	19149	he	396	“ No , ”
19158	19297	19149	19149	he	396	“ That ’s not what I meant . I need you to promise me you wo n’t get so drunk that you are n’t in control of what you ’re doing or saying . Do you know how easy it would ’ve been for me to take advantage of you last night ? I had you naked in my arms , Rave . Do you know how easy it would ’ve been to push my sweatpants aside and slide deep inside you ? I could ’ve pinned you down on this sofa and fucked you raw , and there ’s nothing you would ’ve been able to do about it . Do n’t find yourself alone with a man that wo n’t respect you , someone who would take advantage of you when you are n’t thinking clearly . ”
19320	19325	19326	19326	I	0	“ I hear you , ”
19329	19342	19326	19326	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Ares . This wo n’t happen again . ”
19343	19360	19361	19361	I	0	“ It ’d better not . Not with me , and certainly not with anyone else . ”
19364	19369	19361	19361	I	0	“ It wo n’t , ”
19426	19454	19455	19455	He	397	“ I really am sorry , Ares . I ’m not even sure what to say to you , other than that I ’m ashamed and remorseful . ”
19473	19489	19455	19455	He	397	“ It ’s okay , Rave . Let ’s just forget that happened , okay ? ”
19498	19504	19505	19505	I	0	“ I need to go , ”
19606	19611	19612	19612	he	397	“ Who is it ? ”
19623	19665	19615	19615	I	0	“ Who is the man you were talking about last night ? You said you regretted not going after the man you love , and just now , too , the expression you carried was pure sorrow . Who is he ? ”
19675	19686	19666	19666	I	0	“ Drunken ramblings , Ares . There is n’t anyone . ”
19687	19692	19693	19693	he	397	“ In vino veritas , ”
19726	19729	19730	19730	I	0	“ Fine , ”
19733	19744	19730	19730	I	0	“ I just do n’t want to talk about it . ”
19745	19805	19806	19806	I	0	“ Whoever he is , do n’t try to fuck him out of your system . That never works , and in your case , it ’ll just backfire . You ’re too famous , too easily caught up in scandals . Do n’t risk your reputation for some asshole that ca n’t see what he ’s got anyway . ”
19813	19816	19817	19817	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
19820	19848	19849	19849	He	400	“ I ’m done . I ’m done caring about him , hoping that someday I might have a chance . It ’s time to move on . ”
19890	19894	19895	19895	he	400	“ Come on , ”
19898	19909	19895	19895	he	400	“ Get dressed , and I ’ll drive you home . ”
20129	20132	20133	20133	I	0	“ Raven ! ”
20154	20162	20163	20163	She	26	“ Ready for your last dress fitting ? ”
20175	20188	20166	20166	her	26	“ It ’s beautiful . Is there anything you ca n’t do ? ”
20197	20238	20239	20239	She	26	“ Let ’s see if it fits or not . I can make some final adjustments the night before the wedding to ensure it fits perfectly , but I doubt your weight will fluctuate much in the next two weeks . ”
20323	20326	20327	20327	I	0	“ Wow , ”
20338	20349	20330	20330	Hannah	26	“ It ’s perfect , Rave . I love it . ”
20361	20407	20350	20350	She	26	“ Did you decide if you ’re bringing a date to the wedding ? Do n’t forget the NDA . No one can know what event they ’re actually attending until the day of our wedding , or we ’ll have the paparazzi swarming us . ”
20408	20412	20413	20413	I	0	“ I know , ”
20417	20467	20413	20413	I	0	“ Do n’t worry . I ’m not bringing a date . Your wedding day is all about you , and I want to be there for you . I ca n’t do that if I have to entertain a date . Besides , I ’m not seeing anyone . ”
20542	20555	20556	20556	she	26	“ I suppose it ’s good that you are n’t dating anyone , ”
20560	20591	20556	20556	she	26	“ You ’re lucky in that sense , I guess . Enjoy being single for as long as you can . I did n’t have that luxury for very long . ”
20612	20617	20618	20618	I	0	“ Is everything okay ? ”
20654	20660	20661	20661	she	26	“ I do n’t know , ”
20668	20783	20661	20661	she	26	“ Ares and I are always fighting these days . We ’re barely even friends anymore , and it ’s just insane that we ’re getting married . Sometimes I wonder if it would ’ve been different if Ares had n’t been my first boyfriend . I ’d never been in a serious relationship before him , and because of that , we ’ve always felt like a work - in - progress . Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if we ’d met once I ’d already been in a few relationships . If we ’d learned our lessons before we got together , would everything have felt a little easier ? ”
20826	20882	20883	20883	She	416	“ There ’s a certain beauty in growing together , Han . Knowing that everything you two have accomplished , you did together … that is admirable and enviable . Maybe things could have been different , but they are n’t , and you two have made the best of the cards you were dealt . ”
20895	21064	20892	20892	her	416	“ Maybe , Rave . I ’m not sure , you know ? It ’s just been so hard . The Windsors have so many rules when it comes to our marriage . Did you know Ares and I are n’t allowed to stay away from each other for more than three consecutive nights during the entire first three years of our marriage ? It ’s insane , but if we breach their terms , Ares loses his inheritance . They ’re just so different from us . When I was younger , I thought it was amazing . It made me feel like I was marrying into royalty , but now ? Now it ’s constricting and putting so much strain on my relationship with Ares and my career . I ca n’t just take a break from filming for an entire year , and Ares ca n’t always accompany me on set . How are we supposed to abide by the three - night - rule ? ”
21075	21102	21103	21103	She	417	“ I suppose it ’s hard for you to understand . It ’s so unfortunate that you did n’t have the talent to become an actress . ”
21106	21198	21103	21103	She	417	“ But then again , it ’s a blessing too . Your life is so … nice . You have your modeling work and the prestige that comes from that , but you have enough time left to run your own company . My career is far too demanding for something like that . I have n’t even been able to help Mom out with Dreamessence , you know ? I ’m supposed to manage it with Ares after the merger , but where am I going to find the time ? ”
21281	21295	21296	21296	I	0	“ I ’m sure the three - day thing is negotiable , Han , ”
21316	21323	21324	21324	She	110	“ Just talk to Grandma Anne . ”
21332	21376	21326	21326	her	110	“ Do n’t you think I have n’t tried ? She wo n’t budge on it . Grandma does n’t want me to work at all . The closer we get to the wedding , the more I ’m second - guessing this . ”
21391	21400	21401	21401	She	110	“ You love Ares , do n’t you ? ”
21404	21410	21401	21401	She	110	“ With all my heart . ”
21411	21517	21518	21518	She	110	“ Then you ’ll be okay , Han . I know that being with him requires sacrifices on your part , and I ’m sure it ’s the same for him , too . For years now , he has n’t been able to date you publicly because of your career . That ca n’t have been easy on him either , you know ? There must have been so many things he ’s wanted to do with you and could n’t . Now it ’s your turn to make some sacrifices . That ’s what marriage is supposed to be , right ? Compromise . ”
21534	21601	21527	21527	her	110	“ Yes , I guess so . I guess the worst part is that Ares is so perfect . All of our issues stem from me . I know he deserves everything , but I ’m still having a hard time pushing aside my ego and my aspirations . One year is enough for people to forget about me , you know ? Imagine three years . ”
21609	21644	21606	21606	my	0	“ You ’re Hannah Du Pont . There ’s no way anyone will ever forget about you , Han . You could take a ten - year hiatus and it still would n’t matter . ”
21651	21657	21658	21658	she	420	“ Thank you , Rave , ”
21665	21697	21658	21658	she	420	“ I needed this . I needed to talk to someone who wo n’t judge me for my selfishness , for the thoughts that I should n’t be voicing at all . ”
21708	21747	21698	21698	I	0	“ You ’ll be okay , sis . In two weeks , you ’re going to be the most beautiful bride anyone has ever seen , and soon all of your doubts will seem like a distant memory . ”
21759	21771	21748	21748	She	420	“ You ’ll be by my side , wo n’t you ? ”
21772	21775	21776	21776	I	0	“ Always , ”
21893	21896	21897	21897	she	420	“ Ares , ”
21900	21903	21897	21897	she	420	“ please . ”
21917	21930	21931	21931	I	0	“ You do n’t know what you ’re asking for , Raven , ”
22003	22015	21985	21985	she	420	“ I know exactly what I ’m asking for , Ares . ”
22036	22065	22066	22066	She	420	“ You should n’t even be here , little girl . You ’re too young . Too innocent . What do you think you ’re doing , huh ? ”
22090	22100	22080	22080	she	420	“ I ’m not as innocent as you think . ”
22125	22131	22103	22103	my	0	“ What does that mean ? ”

22173	22176	22165	22165	She	420	“ No . ”
22233	22237	22238	22238	I	0	“ Little liar , ”
22252	22273	22241	22241	I	0	“ You know I hate it when people lie to me , Raven . Do n’t make me punish you . ”
22288	22299	22300	22300	she	420	“ Punish me , Ares . I ’m begging you , ”
22439	22442	22443	22443	I	0	“ Raven , ”
22485	22491	22492	22492	I	0	“ We need to stop , ”

22734	22757	22758	22758	She	24	“ There ’s no going back from this , Raven . If I fuck you tonight , you ’re mine . Forever . ”

23266	23274	23275	23275	she	24	“ Do n’t think I wo n’t , ”

23349	23401	23402	23402	She	24	“ It will , baby . I promise you . I ’m going to make you so fucking wet that it wo n’t hurt for more than one single moment . By the time I push my cock into that sweet pussy of yours , you ’ll be begging for it . ”
23431	23436	23437	23437	I	0	“ I need you , ”

23544	23553	23554	23554	she	24	“ Please do n’t reject me , Ares , ”
23557	23564	23554	23554	she	24	“ I ca n’t … I … ”
23602	23652	23653	23653	She	24	“ I want you so badly , Raven . Do n’t ever , for even a single moment , think that I do n’t . Whenever you ’re in the same room , it takes all of me to stay away from you . I will always want you . ”
23695	23698	23699	23699	I	0	“ Smooth , ”

23932	23942	23929	23929	She	24	“ Usually , it ’s to thoughts of you . ”

24244	24297	24236	24236	I	0	“ Look at me . Tell me you want this , Raven . I do n’t … I do n’t want to take your virginity if you are n’t sure . You and I … our futures are entwined for the rest of our lives , but we are n’t married yet . ”
24344	24357	24358	24358	she	24	“ You ’ll always be the only one I ’ll ever want , ”

24601	24604	24605	24605	I	0	“ Ares ? ”
24635	24645	24646	24646	she	24	“ You were late for our standing breakfast date , ”
24649	24664	24646	24646	she	24	“ You ’re never late , so I came to check up on you . ”
24685	24692	24693	24693	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , Grams , ”
24697	24714	24693	24693	I	0	“ Give me a moment to get ready , okay ? I ’ll meet you downstairs . ”
24822	24844	24845	24845	I	0	“ You know how Grandma feels about our weekly dinners . What do you mean , you ca n’t make it ? ”
24849	24863	24864	24864	She	26	“ I ’m sorry , Ares . I ’m stuck in a meeting . ”
24878	24900	24864	24864	She	26	“ You ’re stuck in a meeting every single week , Han . I ’m tired of making excuses for you . ”
25007	25059	25060	25060	I	0	“ Ares , I ’m already sacrificing so much by getting married to you . Are you seriously kidding me right now ? Do you know how many roles I ’ve had to decline because we ca n’t get our schedules to align ? Why ca n’t you be more supportive ? ”
25072	25209	25060	25060	I	0	“ How could I possibly be any more supportive , Han ? I ’ve agreed to keep our relationship a secret for years so you would n’t be accused of nepotism by your colleagues — or inundated with gossip pieces about me handing you the roles that build your career . I ’ve supported you from the sidelines , quietly , and all I ’ve asked for in return is that same level of support . I do n’t need you to support my career , Han , but I need you here with my family . I need you to be there for our weekly dinners , and I need you to attend some of our charity brunches every once in a while . I need you to start acting like we ’re a family . ”
25210	25213	25214	25214	she	438	“ Ares , ”
25217	25262	25214	25214	she	438	“ Are you seriously trying to say that you built my career for me ? You may have given me the roles I wanted , but I would n’t have succeeded if I was n’t talented . Do n’t take that away from me . ”
25273	25281	25282	25282	I	0	“ You are n’t listening to me , ”
25289	25368	25282	25282	I	0	“ I never said I built your career , Hannah . I said I gave you the roles that allowed you to do so . There ’s countless talent , but there are few opportunities . I ’ve literally invested in entire movies just because you wanted a specific role . I ’ve never asked you for anything in return , but I ’m asking you now . I need you to start prioritizing my family and me . ”
25369	25417	25429	25429	her	439	“ This is such bullshit , Ares . Why ca n’t you just be more understanding ? Why do you bring up our relationship being a secret every single time , anyway ? How come you ca n’t understand my need to keep my private life private ? ”
25451	25485	25444	25444	I	0	“ Han , I ca n’t do this again . Let ’s just not talk about this , okay ? I need to go anyway , or I ’ll be late for dinner . ”
25486	25489	25490	25490	I	0	“ Fine ! ”
25759	25767	25768	25768	Zane	40	“ Ares . Come take a seat , ”
25788	25794	25795	25795	Zane	40	“ I ’m fucking starving , ”
25802	25809	25795	25795	Zane	40	“ What took you so long ? ”
25810	25817	25818	25818	Luca	41	“ Probably arguing with Hannah again , ”
25821	25824	25818	25818	Luca	41	“ Boys ! ”
25975	25982	25983	25983	Grandma	44	“ You ’re late , sweetheart , ”
26008	26014	26015	26015	I	0	“ Let ’s dig in , ”
26114	26117	26118	26118	Grandma	44	“ Ares , ”
26150	26160	26146	26146	she	44	“ I take it Hannah could n’t make it ? ”
26186	26194	26182	26182	she	44	“ No matter . Raven is here . ”
26247	26255	26256	26256	Zane	40	“ Why are you so quiet today ? ”
26259	26265	26256	26256	Zane	40	“ No celebrity gossip today ? ”
26266	26270	26271	26271	Luca	41	“ Yeah man , ”
26274	26289	26271	26271	Luca	41	“ I live for the drama you encounter at work . Fill us in . ”
26514	26517	26518	26518	she	24	“ Oh , ”
26521	26524	26518	26518	she	24	“ Ares . ”
26525	26530	26531	26531	I	0	“ You sound disappointed . ”
26568	26575	26576	26576	I	0	“ No , not at all . ”
26582	26589	26576	26576	I	0	“ Were you waiting for Lex ? ”
26605	26608	26598	26598	I	0	“ Hmm ? ”
26609	26614	26615	26615	I	0	“ I … no . ”
26618	26654	26615	26615	I	0	“ Good . I love my brother , but he ’s not for you . He ’s a fuckboy . He wo n’t get serious with anyone other than the woman Grandma chooses for him . ”
26664	26673	26661	26661	her	24	“ Um , are you worried about me ? ”
26677	26710	26661	26661	her	24	“ Do n’t be . Besides , what makes you think I ’m after a serious relationship ? How much longer are you going to see both Sierra and me as children ? ”
26743	26755	26726	26726	I	0	“ Do n’t you even fucking think about it , Raven . ”
26766	26778	26763	26763	her	24	“ I ’m an adult , Ares . So is he . ”
26800	26828	26829	26829	She	24	“ I do n’t give a fuck whether or not you ’re an adult , Raven . You ’re not fucking my brother , you hear me ? ”
26835	26863	26829	26829	She	24	“ Or what ? You might be Sierra ’s brother , but you are n’t mine . You have no right to interfere in my sex life . ”
26864	26885	26886	26886	She	24	“ And I wo n’t — so long as the person you ’re fucking is n’t one of my brothers . ”
26893	26899	26888	26888	her	24	“ Why would you care ? ”
26920	26927	26928	26928	I	0	“ Family is important to me , ”
26933	26994	26928	26928	I	0	“ Grandma loves you , and so does Sierra . You ’re as much part of this family as Hannah is , perhaps more so . I do n’t want you to mess up our family dynamics because of lust . Once things end , it ’d be awkward for both of you , and it ’d affect us all . ”
27022	27025	27026	27026	she	24	“ Oh , ”
27030	27033	27026	27026	she	24	“ Right . ”
27101	27112	27113	27113	Dom	46	“ We ’re planning to acquire the following streaming services , ”
27457	27463	27464	27464	she	26	“ I checked your schedule , ”
27468	27478	27464	27464	she	26	“ And it seems you ’re free , right ? ”
27515	27518	27519	27519	I	0	“ Hannah , ”

27647	27653	27654	27654	she	26	“ We need to talk , ”
27726	27735	27736	27736	I	0	“ What would you like to talk about ? ”
27743	27746	27747	27747	she	26	“ Ares , ”
27754	27769	27747	27747	she	26	“ I ca n’t do this . I … I ca n’t marry you . ”
27792	27809	27770	27770	I	0	“ Our wedding is next week , Hannah . You ’ve postponed it three times now . ”
27810	27940	27941	27941	I	0	“ Ares , I ’m serious . The more I think about it , the more it torments me . Because of your family ’s rules , we ca n’t spend more than three consecutive days apart for the entire first three years of our marriage , but how is that supposed to work ? You ca n’t take time off from work to accompany me when I ’m filming , and I ca n’t take three years off . How many years do I really have left in my prime ? I ’m at the height of my career , and I ca n’t walk away from that now . Maybe the time will be right for us someday , but we both know it is n’t now . ”
27965	27968	27969	27969	I	0	“ Hannah , ”
27976	28047	27969	27969	I	0	“ I hear you , honey . I do . But this marriage between us ? It is n’t just a marriage between you and me . It ’s also one between our families , our companies . We ’re lucky that we fell in love with each other , but ultimately , this is an arranged marriage . It ’s not something either of us can walk away from . ”
28053	28151	28050	28050	her	477	“ I know . I ’m not saying I wo n’t marry you at all . I ’m just saying not now . Someday , we ’ll be in a stage of our lives where we want children , and I ’ll want to take it easier in my career … but that time is n’t now , Ares . Marriage is n’t something we should mess around with . If we get married now , I do n’t think our relationship could survive the strain . I definitely do n’t think my career could withstand it . ”
28177	28180	28181	28181	I	0	“ Han , ”
28188	28226	28181	28181	I	0	“ I know you ’re worried , and I get that the stress is getting to you , but we ’re going to be okay . We do n’t have the luxury of walking away from this . ”
28250	28257	28258	28258	she	26	“ I ’m sorry , Ares , ”
28309	28318	28319	28319	I	0	“ Hannah , do n’t be like that , ”
28327	28332	28322	28322	She	26	“ I ’m sorry . ”
28495	28511	28512	28512	Dion	39	“ What is this shit about you two breaking up a week before the wedding ? ”
28516	28554	28512	28512	Dion	39	“ You ’re supposed to be the lucky one out of us , dickhead . You ’re the only one of us that actually gets to marry the person you love , and you pull this bullshit . ”
28569	28614	28615	28615	Luca	41	“ It ’s not like I wanted to , Dion . I ’m as surprised as you are . I knew we had our issues , but what couple does n’t ? I did n’t expect her to call off the wedding for real . ”
28624	28648	28649	28649	He	41	“ You fucking suck at this consolation shit . Why did any of us think you were going to be our best bet ? ”
28656	28671	28649	28649	He	41	“ You try , Lex . Put that PhD of yours to good use . ”
28681	28702	28678	28678	his	41	“ I have a PhD in robotics . What am I supposed to do ? Build him a robot fiancee ? ”
28708	28756	28703	28703	Zane	40	“ I bet the robot would still have more character than Hannah ever did . Do n’t tell me any of you are actually upset they broke up ? Fuck this love match bullshit , because when it comes to Ares , love clearly is fucking blind . ”
28770	28774	28775	28775	I	0	“ Thanks guys , ”
28779	28787	28775	28775	I	0	“ I feel so much better now . ”
28837	28857	28858	28858	They	1886	“ Did you guys truly not like her , or are you just trying to make me feel better ? ”
28895	29032	28890	28890	Dion	39	“ It ’s not that we do n’t like her , Ares . It ’s just that she clearly was n’t the one for you . Hannah is a diva , and some guys are really into that , but you are n’t one of them . We all saw how it killed you to have to cater to her at every turn , never getting much in return . She would n’t even publicly acknowledge your relationship , you know ? I always felt like you deserved better than that , so no , I ’m not upset she broke things off with you . Someone had to do it , and I know you never would . You ’d stick with her , even if it ’s just to comply with Grandma ’s terms . ”
29042	29045	29046	29046	he	489	“ Ares , ”
29049	29075	29046	29046	he	489	“ tell us the truth . Were you happy with her in recent years , or had you just gotten used to the status quo ? ”
29084	29093	29094	29094	I	0	“ What the fuck are you ? Socrates ? ”
29102	29142	29099	29099	his	41	“ He ’s avoiding the question , boys . You know what that means , right ? Ares knows he was n’t happy , but he ’s loyal till the fucking end . Wo n’t admit it even now . ”
29194	29197	29198	29198	I	0	“ Ares . ”
29300	29309	29310	29310	Grandma	44	“ I ’m sorry Hannah broke things off , ”
29313	29324	29310	29310	Grandma	44	“ but that wedding is happening with or without her . ”
29325	29328	29329	29329	I	0	“ What ? ”
29334	29342	29343	29343	Grandma	44	“ What do you mean , Grams ? ”
29346	29383	29343	29343	Grandma	44	“ Hannah is n’t the woman I wanted you to marry in the first place . This just proves that I was right . I made an exception for you , and I should n’t have . ”
29428	29473	29416	29416	Sierra	22	“ If Hannah wo n’t marry you , then Raven must . If Raven also refuses , the deal with the Du Ponts is off the table , and I ’ll slash your inheritance in half regardless of whether I find you another girl . ”
29474	29491	29492	29492	I	0	“ Grandma ! I … I ca n’t marry Raven . This … this is ridiculous . ”
29525	29556	29557	29557	I	0	“ I ca n’t . Not her , Grandma . She ’s a friend . I ’ve always seen her the same way I see Sierra , you know that . ”
29620	29628	29629	29629	I	0	“ Raven would never agree to it , ”
29632	29649	29629	29629	I	0	“ I dated her sister for years . Why would she ever even consider marrying me ? ”
29681	29689	29690	29690	I	0	“ Do n’t do this to her , ”
29693	29731	29690	29690	I	0	“ Raven is n’t meant to be tied down . It ca n’t be her , Grandma . Give me some time , and I ’ll make Hannah see reason . She ’ll be there , Grams . ”
29737	29843	29732	29732	Grandma	44	“ She wo n’t be . I highly recommend that you speak to Raven before I do , Ares . I never should have given you as much freedom as I did . There ’s a reason your marriages are decided upon by me . It ’s a centuries long tradition that has never failed us , yet we deviated with you . I was in the wrong for doing so , and I ’ll be correcting my mistake as swiftly as possible . I ’m not canceling your wedding . It ’ll happen , and you ’ll marry the woman I chose for you . ”
29844	29847	29848	29848	I	0	“ Sierra , ”
29851	29867	29868	29868	She	499	“ Are you seriously just going to stand there and let this happen to Raven ? ”
29878	29883	29884	29884	she	499	“ I trust Grams , ”
29888	29943	29884	29884	she	499	“ She knows what ’s best for you better than you do , Ares . And truthfully ? I ca n’t think of a better husband for my best friend than you . You ’d never mistreat her , and if given enough time , you ’d make her happy , wo n’t you ? ”
29997	30000	30001	30001	I	0	“ Fuck ! ”
30017	30027	30028	30028	Dion	39	“ Thanks for standing up for me , fuckers . ”

30412	30437	30438	30438	She	44	“ We wo n’t cancel the wedding . This marriage is long overdue , and it was always meant to be an arranged marriage . ”

30569	30601	30566	30566	her	44	“ This is not a joke , sweetheart . I will no longer accept Hannah into our family . If this merger is to proceed , the bride must be you . ”
30612	30649	30650	30650	She	44	“ Have you spoken to Hannah and Ares ? I ’m not sure what ’s going on , Grandma Anne , but this must be some kind of misunderstanding . How about I speak to Hannah ? ”
30655	30723	30652	30652	her	44	“ Even if she were to change her mind , I ’m no longer willing to welcome her into our family . The woman I wanted Ares to marry has always been you , and perhaps this is just life ’s way of allowing me to correct my mistake before it was too late . The wedding will go ahead , and the bride must be you . ”
30746	30751	30752	30753	Grandma Anne	44	“ Does Ares know ? ”
30756	30788	30752	30753	Grandma Anne	44	“ He ’s been informed . The Windsors have a history of successful arranged marriages , and he ’s well aware of that . He knows what is expected of him . ”

31128	31168	31125	31125	his	181	“ I ’m not sure that ’s enough anymore . Now that they ’ve decided that they ’ll no longer accept her as Ares ’s wife , love ca n’t save them . She made her choice , Rave . ”
31179	31197	31169	31169	I	0	“ She made her choice , but I ’m the one who has to pay the price . ”
31210	31267	31198	31198	Dad	37	“ I ’m sorry , Raven . They wo n’t change their minds . This deal always entailed a marriage between Ares and you . The only reason they made an exception is because Hannah fell in love with him . She lifted the burden you were meant to carry , but it was always yours . ”
31279	31346	31274	31274	I	0	“ If I was always meant to marry him , she should ’ve stayed away from him . You ca n’t expect me to marry my sister ’s ex , Dad . You ca n’t do this to me .

31356	31417	31347	31347	Dad	37	“ I ’m sorry , Raven , but you have no choice . Throughout the years , we ’ve relied a lot on the Windsors . If this merger were to fall through , it ’d mean bankruptcy for us . If you want to keep your company and the investment funds I promised you , you ’ll marry him . ”

31437	31564	31434	31434	Dad	37	“ I ’m not , Raven . I ’m just telling you the truth . If you do not marry Ares , we ’ll lose everything . Everything the Windsors have done for us … it would take me several lifetimes to repay that . Think through this carefully , sweetheart . He would treat you well , and the Windsors love you . It ’s a small price to pay for everything we ’ve been given , everything we stand to gain from this merger . Do n’t forget , you marrying Ares means the company will fall into your hands , not Hannah ’s . I will ensure it . You ’ll inherit my shares , even if your mother gives hers to Hannah . ”

Do you really want that ? I know you love him , and he worships the ground you walk on . I know he makes you happy , Han . ”
32017	32050	32014	32014	her	26	“ I ca n’t , Rave . I really ca n’t . If I marry him , I ’ll just end up resenting him for everything I ’ll lose in the process . ”

32218	32264	32265	32265	She	26	“ I am . Dad told me that if I do n’t , I ’ll lose my company and all the money he promised to invest in me . Grandma Anne warned him that she ’ll pull away all support if this marriage falls through . ”
32273	32309	32265	32265	She	26	“ They ’re just trying to strong - arm me , Raven . They wo n’t actually make you do that . Besides , Ares would n’t ever agree to it . That ’s sick . ”
32336	32369	32370	32370	Hannah	26	“ I ’m not sure , Han . I do n’t think they ’re merely bluffing . Dad seemed worried , and I ’ve never seen Grandma Anne look quite so serious . ”
32375	32380	32381	32381	she	26	“ Do n’t worry , ”
32385	32423	32381	32381	she	26	“ You wo n’t be forced to do anything , Rave . They wo n’t make you . They ’re merely threatening us and using you to make me change my mind , but I wo n’t . ”

32431	32535	32428	32428	I	0	“ Can you truly bear to watch Ares marry someone else ? Marry me ? I know you love him , Han , so please think about this carefully . If they are n’t bluffing , then what ? Will you really stand back and become Ares ’s sister - in - law ? Because that ’s what ’ll happen if you see this through . Dad made it quite clear that if you ’re not there on your wedding day , I ’ll have to walk down the aisle in your stead , or I ’ll lose everything I ’ve worked for . ”
32598	32625	32587	32587	Hannah	26	“ I ’m certain , Rave . I ca n’t do this . I wo n’t sign away my life for anyone — not even Ares . ”

32676	32750	32673	32673	I	0	“ Be reasonable , for God ’s sake . Ca n’t you see what you ’re doing to me ? You ’ll get off easy , but what about me ? I ’ll be stuck having to marry a man who has only ever loved you , and if I refuse , I ’ll lose my career . Do n’t do this to me , Han . Do n’t do this to Ares . ”
32766	32871	32757	32757	her	26	“ It wo n’t come to that , Raven . You wo n’t lose your company . Neither Dad nor Grandma Anne would ever let that happen . She loves you more than she ’s ever loved me , you know ? Even if I do n’t marry Ares , she wo n’t punish you for it . Do n’t worry , okay ? You wo n’t get trapped in a loveless marriage , or whatever it is that ’s going through your mind . Forget the fear Dad instilled in you , Rave . Everything is going to be okay . I promise . ”

34010	34036	34004	34004	She	24	“ Ares , I want love . Real love . I want a happy marriage and a faithful husband . Can you give me that ? ”

34103	34159	34099	34099	I	0	“ I ca n’t guarantee that I ’ll make you happy , but I swear to try . As for being a faithful husband ? Yes , Raven . I ’m surprised you even feel the need to ask . From the moment you become my wife , I swear to be faithful to you . ”
34170	34211	34166	34166	her	24	“ That ’s easy for you to say now that you ’re trying to coerce me into this marriage , but what will that look like in practise , Ares ? Will you be able to stay away from Hannah ? ”
34219	34273	34166	34166	her	24	“ Yes , Raven . I would never cheat on my wife . I may be imperfect , but I ’m not immoral . I ’d never disrespect you or our marriage like that . Hannah made her choice when she ended things between us , and there ’s no going back now . ”

34516	34596	34597	34597	Her	552	“ Ares , if we do this … if it really gets to that point … I need you to know that I expect more than just affection and respect . I expect you to keep an appropriate distance from my sister , regardless of your history . If I make this sacrifice , I wo n’t allow you to make me regret it . If I marry you , I want you to treat me as your wife . ”
34655	34691	34692	34692	Her	552	“ So long as it ’s within my power , there ’s nothing I wo n’t give you , Raven . No matter what you ask , it ’s yours — and that includes me . ”

34983	35027	34980	34980	I	0	“ You and I will figure this out , Raven . If we end up getting married , we ’ll find our own happiness . It might not be easy , but if this is our destiny , it ’ll work itself out . ”

35147	35168	35143	35143	she	101	“ You ’ve been in love with Ares all your life . Why would you want Hannah to show up ? ”
35181	35317	35169	35169	I	0	“ Because he ’s always been hers , Sierra . Even if he marries me , the one he wants will always be Hannah . It ’s hard enough to watch him love her the way he does , but legally being able to call him mine while I know that his heart will always belong to her ? That would kill me , Sierra . I ’d much rather stay friends with him than be the person standing between him and the woman he truly loves . I do n’t want to be a replacement , a reminder of Hannah . If we get married now , I ’ll never be able to step out of Hannah ’s shadow . I ’ll always be a cheap replica of her , a stand - in . ”
35327	35484	35320	35320	her	22	“ I ’ve always found it so odd , you know ? It never made sense to me that someone that shines the way you do feels like they ’re cast in shadows . She ’s like the moon , Raven . Beautiful on a lonely night , but cold and distant . You ? You ’re the sun . You ’re warmth and happiness , and the centre of all that ’s good . Similarly , Ares ’s world will revolve around you if you give him a chance . I know my brother , babe . If you give this marriage an honest chance , he ’ll make you happy . I ’ve always said this , and I ’ll say it again : there ’s always been something between Ares and you . Now you can both finally give into it , and it ’ll be the best thing you ’ll ever do . ”

I wish I had n’t taken you for granted . If I had n’t , then perhaps this moment between us would ’ve been different . It would n’t diminish your sacrifice in any way , but perhaps I ’d have known how to console you , how to encourage you . ”

She was so sick as a child that she spent years at home , missing school and opportunities to make friends , to just be a kid . I ’m sorry , Raven . Perhaps my words mean nothing to you , but I wanted to say it nonetheless . Today , more so than usual , the distance between us pains me . I wish you and I could have been like any mother and daughter the morning before the wedding . I wish that , despite the circumstances , I could ’ve been the one you turn to . My eyes are open now , Raven . I see what I ’ve done , what my actions have turned your sister into . ”

38456	38487	38453	38453	Raven	48	“ Ares and I are both very private people , so we ’ve tried our best to stay out of the spotlight , and we ’ll continue to do so . ”

38835	38887	38888	38888	She	44	“ Everything went as I expected today , but I understand that both of you are confused and uncertain about your future , so I ’d like to take the time to ensure you ’re familiar with the rules you must abide by throughout the first three years of your marriage . ”
38894	38905	38888	38888	She	44	“ You might be aware , but Raven is not . ”

38911	38914	38915	38915	she	44	“ No , ”
38920	38949	38915	38915	she	44	“ It ’s best that I explain this myself , and it ’s best for both of you to go into this knowing what is expected of you . ”

39062	39078	38994	38994	Grandma	44	“ One . Ares and you may not spend more than three consecutive nights apart . ”
39148	39176	39177	39177	I	0	“ Two . When you ’re together , you must share a bed . You can not live separate lives , nor can you have separate bedrooms . ”
39220	39282	39202	39202	she	24	“ Three . You must remain married for three years . If , after that time , you decide you truly are n’t well - suited , you can get a divorce without penalty . However , there has never been a divorce in the Windsor family , and I have full faith that your marriage will not be an exception . ”
39329	39394	39395	39395	Raven	24	“ Four . You must remain faithful to each other . If either of you cheats on the other , you both lose everything . You ’ll lose your parents ’ company , and Ares will lose his inheritance . Family is at the core of everything we are , everything we ’ve built . And your family ? It starts with each other . ”
39440	39468	39469	39469	Grandma	44	“ The fifth and final rule is that you must give your marriage an honest chance . Be open to this working out for both of you . ”
39505	39565	39566	39566	She	44	“ Do n’t cling to the lives you had before marriage . Give each other an honest chance , and in three years , I ’ll sign the paperwork declaring the company jointly yours , making the two of you the owners of this country ’s largest media company . You ’ll be handed your inheritance too , Ares . ”
39578	39678	39566	39566	She	44	“ I know this is all very sudden , so for the next four weeks , I will relieve you from all family obligations . You wo n’t need to attend family dinners or charity events . All I want you to do for now is focus on your marriage . Spend time together , get to know each other on a different level . Soon , the entire world will find out about you , and the pressure will add some additional strain to your marriage . Spend some quality time together before all that weighs you down . ”
39759	39769	39770	39770	Grandma	44	“ Carry your bride in the way you should , ”

40379	40435	40376	40376	her	24	“ I would ’ve been embarrassed if you had n’t . Not that many people knew about Hannah and you , and the few who do are tied to an NDA . Most of our guests assumed our wedding was real , and thankfully , we ’ve been able to make it look real too . ”
40506	40515	40516	40516	I	0	“ We should probably talk about … us , ”
40526	40532	40519	40519	Raven	24	“ Yes . We should . ”
40550	40589	40533	40533	I	0	“ I ’m sorry it came to this , Raven . The thought of me being the reason you do n’t get to live the life you envisioned for yourself , fuck . I ’m so fucking sorry . ”
40590	40593	40594	40594	Her	24	“ Ares . ”
40610	40642	40602	40602	I	0	“ This is n’t your fault . I admit that I also did n’t think Hannah truly would n’t show up , but it ’s done now . We ’re married . ”
40694	40738	40684	40684	I	0	“ Raven , I want you to know that I do n’t expect anything from you . All I ask is that we make it look like we ’re giving our marriage an honest chance — in Grandma ’s eyes , at least . ”
40739	40745	40746	40746	she	646	“ In Grandma ’s eyes , ”
40756	40762	40746	40746	she	646	“ What does that mean ? ”
40777	40901	40763	40763	I	0	“ It means we only have to fake it in her presence . So long as she thinks we ’re trying our best to be together , she ’ll leave us alone . I ’m the first of my siblings to get married , so I ’m not entirely sure what to expect either , but I know my grandmother . If she thinks we are n’t trying , she ’ll come up with all kinds of schemes , and we ca n’t have that . You only know Grandma as the sweet old lady she pretends to be in front of you , but she ’s hard to deal with . I love her , but she can be a true nightmare . ”
40991	41014	41015	41015	She	24	“ So you want to pretend we ’re making our marriage work , and what will you be doing in the meantime ? ”
41061	41080	41033	41033	she	24	“ Do you intend to fuck my sister while you make me fulfill the terms of our marriage ? ”
41099	41104	41105	41105	I	0	“ Of course not , ”
41108	41119	41105	41105	I	0	“ Just what do you think of me , Raven ? ”
41167	41284	41285	41285	I	0	“ I do n’t know , Ares . It sounds an awful lot like you ’re asking me to pretend to be your wife for three years , until you can divorce me and go back to my sister . It ’s all super convenient for you two , is n’t it ? Hannah runs away , so she does n’t have to suffer through the limitations this marriage would impose on her career , and for the next three years , she gets to focus on her acting career while I ’m trapped in this marriage with you . Are you really going to take three years of my life and sacrifice them for Hannah ? ”
41344	41347	41348	41348	I	0	“ No , ”
41352	41397	41348	41348	I	0	“ No . I wo n’t sacrifice three years of your life , Raven . What I ’m saying is that there are rules we need to abide by , and faking it in front of Grandma will make both of our lives easier . ”
41409	41449	41450	41450	Raven	24	“ I ’m not sure what this marriage will be like for us . I ’m not sure where I stand with Hannah , either . Right now , there ’s a lot I do n’t know , Rave . ”
41485	41505	41506	41506	I	0	“ We do n’t need to figure everything out at once . We can take our time , okay ? ”
41510	41526	41506	41506	I	0	“ How about I show you around , and we just get an early night ? ”
41748	41864	41865	41865	I	0	“ I like my privacy , so I do n’t enjoy having staff around . My housekeeper and chef come in during the day , when I ’m at work , so they wo n’t really bother you . You wo n’t see them at all . I ’ll show you how to download the app the entire family uses later . You may have seen Sierra use it before . If you need anything at all , just send a request through the app and it ’ll get done , whether it be groceries or painting the walls . We have an entire team of butlers that know how to get nearly anything done . ”
41872	41884	41885	41885	he	669	“ This is the last room . It ’s my bedroom , ”
41888	41898	41899	41899	He	669	“ I suppose it ’s ours now , actually . ”
42002	42026	41992	41992	Ares	25	“ Your suitcases were delivered earlier today . You should find everything you need in the dressing room . Let me show you . ”
42107	42110	42111	42111	He	25	“ I … ”
42123	42152	42111	42111	He	25	“ I was n’t thinking , Raven . It was all so sudden . Until this morning , I was hoping … I have n’t had a chance — ”
42165	42170	42171	42171	I	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
42184	42253	42182	42182	him	25	“ But you should know that I do n’t want her hand - me - downs . I do n’t want to be surrounded by the remains of your relationship with her . Our marriage might not be a conventional one , but I ’d still like to ask you for a basic level of respect . I wo n’t live in her shadow throughout our entire marriage . ”
42254	42258	42259	42259	he	25	“ Of course , ”
42266	42290	42259	42259	he	25	“ I understand . I ’m sorry . I ’ll have her things packed up and delivered to her . How about that ? ”
42371	42386	42356	42356	I	0	“ I ’m exhausted , and I honestly just want to go to bed . ”
42400	42412	42413	42413	Ares	25	“ Can you help me with the buttons on the back ? ”
42566	42577	42550	42550	He	25	“ How far do you want me to unbutton this ? ”
42629	42634	42635	42635	I	0	“ All the way , ”
42638	42661	42635	42635	I	0	“ The fabric is quite delicate , so I do n’t want to damage it by trying to undo the buttons myself . ”
42980	42983	42984	42984	I	0	“ Ares , ”
43021	43028	43029	43029	he	25	“ Go to bed without me , ”
43183	43186	43187	43187	I	0	“ Ares , ”
43190	43193	43187	43187	I	0	“ Hmm ? ”
43209	43212	43213	43213	he	25	“ Raven , ”
43302	43307	43308	43308	Donna	65	“ Ares , sweetheart , ”
43311	43322	43308	43308	Donna	65	“ There ’s … there ’s someone at the entrance . ”
43332	43335	43336	43336	I	0	“ Hannah , ”
43349	43358	43359	43359	I	0	“ What are we going to tell her ? ”
43442	43453	43428	43428	Ares	25	“ What do you want me to say to her ? ”
43466	43557	43454	43454	I	0	“ I want you to tell her what you told me at the altar . You told me you ’d give me your all , Ares . I ’m asking you to keep that promise . I know how much you love her , but I wo n’t let you cheat on me — nor will I let you embarrass me . I demand the respect I ’m due as your wife , the respect you would ’ve shown Hannah if she had n’t left you at the altar yesterday . ”
43565	43568	43569	43569	he	686	“ Understood , ”
43600	43606	43607	43607	he	686	“ Let ’s get ready , ”
43611	43648	43607	43607	he	686	“ She ’ll want to speak to both of us , I ’m sure . I ’ll leave you to use our ensuite bathroom , and I ’ll head over to the bathroom in our gym . ”
43787	43790	43791	43791	he	25	“ Ready ? ”
43803	43806	43807	43807	I	0	“ No , ”
43865	43875	43852	43852	Ares	25	“ It ’ll be okay . Let ’s go . ”
43952	43960	43961	43961	she	26	“ Tell me it is n’t true , ”
43968	43975	43961	43961	she	26	“ I ’m sorry , Hannah . ”
44017	44036	44037	44037	She	26	“ Raven , this is some kind of sick joke , right ? Please tell me it is . ”
44085	44093	44094	44094	she	26	“ How could you marry my fiancé ? ”
44099	44150	44094	44094	she	26	“ How could you possibly agree to marry someone who will never love you ? Why would you do this to me , Raven ? If you ’d just walked away , they ’d have postponed the wedding and they would n’t have been able to blame Ares for it . ”
44151	44154	44155	44155	I	0	“ Hannah , ”
44162	44259	44155	44155	I	0	“ I called you over a hundred times . I sent you text messages , left you voice notes , and I even emailed you . I tried to contact you in every single way I could think of , but you chose to ignore me . I told you that Dad threatened to pull all funding for my company if I did n’t walk down that aisle , and you still did n’t show up . You were willing to risk your future , but that does n’t mean I was willing to risk mine . ”
44271	44274	44275	44275	she	695	“ Ares , ”
44282	44299	44275	44275	she	695	“ How could you ? She ’s my sister , for God ’s sake . This … ”
44311	44318	44300	44300	She	695	“ You two … are you … ”
44319	44322	44323	44323	Ares	25	“ No , ”
44327	44354	44323	44323	Ares	25	“ Never . I ’ve never loved anyone but you , Hannah . I never will . How could I possibly want someone other than you ? ”
44411	44424	44425	44425	Ares	25	“ Where does this leave us , Ares ? What about us ? ”
44458	44480	44481	44481	She	697	“ You know how I feel about marriage , Hannah . You chose to walk away from this , from us . ”
44488	44501	44481	44481	She	697	“ You only have to remain married for three years , right ? ”
44513	44526	44510	44510	he	25	“ I ’ll wait . I ’ll wait for you , Ares . ”
44563	44570	44571	44571	she	697	“ Three years will fly by , ”
44578	44642	44571	44571	she	697	“ I ’ll focus on my career for the next three years , and once you two get a divorce , I ’ll retire and marry you . I see it now , Ares . I do n’t need my career as much as I need you . I ’d never have walked away if I thought they ’d make you marry Raven . ”
44655	44738	44649	44649	her	697	“ I ’m so sorry , Rave . This … it ’s all my fault . Having to marry your brother - in - law … I ca n’t imagine how hard this must be for you . I know it ’s too late for apologies , but I truly am sorry . I ’ll set this right , I swear . I know three years seems like a lot , but you ’ll walk away with Mom and Dad ’s company . ”
44855	44862	44863	44863	she	26	“ I trust both of you , ”
44883	44936	44872	44872	She	26	“ I know you ’ve been put in a difficult situation , but I wo n’t doubt the love between us , Ares . We ’ve been together for five years . In the grand scheme of things , three years is nothing — not compared to the rest of our lives . ”
44950	45008	44947	44947	her	26	“ Had it been anyone else , I ’d have been insecure and scared , but I know you ’ll never hurt me . You would never betray me in that way , and I know you ’ll never see Ares as your husband , no matter what label the world is forcing you two to wear . ”
45115	45118	45119	45119	she	26	“ Raven , ”
45173	45179	45180	45180	she	26	“ I need to go , ”
45184	45194	45180	45180	she	26	“ I ’m supposed to be on set today . ”
45321	45328	45329	45329	she	26	“ I ’ll see you later , ”
45337	45349	45329	45329	she	26	“ Let ’s have dinner and talk things through , okay ? ”
45491	45497	45498	45498	I	0	“ My words still stand , ”
45508	45598	45498	45498	I	0	“ I wo n’t let you cheat on me . If you want to be with Hannah once our three years are up , then so be it . But until then , I need you to be faithful to me . You might think that you can sneak around and wo n’t get caught , but that is n’t a risk that ’s worth taking . If you cheat on me , I stand to lose as much as you do . I wo n’t let it happen . ”
45627	45632	45633	45633	he	25	“ I hear you , ”
45640	45708	45633	45633	he	25	“ I wo n’t break my vows , Raven . I wo n’t lie to you and tell you that I ’m not tempted , because I am . It would be so easy to pretend that you and I are n’t married at all — that we ’re just roommates , that you ’re still just my fiancee ’s little sister . But I wo n’t . ”
45948	45954	45955	45955	I	0	“ Where are you going ? ”
46105	46108	46094	46094	I	0	“ Dinner . ”
46124	46132	46109	46109	Raven	24	“ Is that so ? With who ? ”

46344	46354	46331	46331	She	24	“ Undressing my husband . What are you doing ? ”
46370	46376	46355	46355	I	0	“ It ’s just dinner . ”
46377	46381	46382	46382	I	0	“ Is it ? ”
46385	46415	46382	46382	I	0	“ Raven … I swear , I ’ll keep my promise . Despite my past with Hannah and my feelings for her , I wo n’t cheat on you . ”
46431	46434	46435	46435	she	24	“ Ares , ”
46438	46588	46435	46435	she	24	“ I do n’t want to make you unhappy . Hannah made it sound like it ’s nothing , but three years is a long time . I do n’t really know what to do . I ’ll be honest with you , I do n’t share well , and I can be quite jealous . The moment you and I got married , you became mine . I refuse to be made a fool of , and I wo n’t let you two sacrifice me for your own selfish goals . I wo n’t be your front while you screw my sister behind my back . I do n’t know what our marriage will look like , and I ’m well aware that you ’re in love with her , but you ’re insane if you think I ’m going to stand back and watch you date her . ”
46603	46632	46589	46589	She	711	“ I want you to be happy , Ares … but not with her . Not like that . Not after what you ’ve both asked of me . ”
46696	46764	46684	46684	I	0	“ I hear you , Rave . I do . This is confusing for me too , but you ’re right . I ’m yours … and you ? You ’re mine . It ’s going to take us some time to navigate this marriage , but I can promise you this much : I wo n’t ever betray you , nor will I knowingly hurt you . ”
46804	46808	46809	46809	I	0	“ And Raven ? ”
46813	46845	46846	46846	She	24	“ I do n’t share at all . If you ’re asking me to keep my distance from Hannah , you better be keeping your distance from other men , too . ”
46859	46864	46865	46865	she	24	“ I ’m yours , ”
46875	46879	46865	46865	she	24	“ Only yours . ”
47008	47014	47015	47015	I	0	“ I ’ll do it , ”
47083	47090	47091	47091	she	24	“ Do n’t let me down , ”
47115	47120	47103	47103	I	0	“ I wo n’t , ”
47274	47277	47258	47258	she	24	“ Ares ! ”
47328	47332	47333	47333	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”
47352	47363	47364	47364	I	0	“ Ares … please do n’t be mad at me . ”
47401	47404	47387	47387	Hannah	26	“ Ares … ”
47405	47410	47411	47411	I	0	“ Where were you ? ”
47415	47425	47411	47411	I	0	“ On our wedding day , where were you ? ”
47442	47455	47456	47456	she	26	“ I genuinely did n’t think they ’d make Raven do this , ”
47463	47510	47456	47456	she	26	“ I ’d just landed my dream role , and I was just trying to stall . I thought this would be the only way to do it . So long as you were n’t involved , your grandmother would n’t punish you for my actions . ”
47547	47557	47558	47558	She	26	“ You gambled , and you lost , Hannah . ”
47567	47622	47564	47564	her	26	“ It was unexpected , but Raven wo n’t mind getting a divorce in three years . This only slightly derailed our plans . Raven and you used to hang out every once in a while , so there ’s no reason we ca n’t do the same . No one needs to know . ”
47631	47653	47623	47623	I	0	“ Are you asking me to cheat on my wife with you ? You want to be my mistress , Han ? ”
47660	47668	47669	47669	she	26	“ She is n’t really your wife , ”
47672	47694	47669	47669	she	26	“ Besides , it ’s not like Raven will mind . Or are you planning to remain celibate for three years ? ”
47719	47785	47714	47714	I	0	“ Hannah . You ’ve always known that marriage is sacred in the Windsor family , and I ’m no exception . I wo n’t cheat on my wife , regardless of who she is . I ’ll treat her with the respect she deserves . You chose to walk away from us , and Raven and I were left to deal with the consequences . ”
47786	47836	47837	47837	I	0	“ I messed up , Ares . I know I did … but this … you and I have been together for as long as I can remember . I do n’t understand . Are you seriously telling me you want to be with my sister in that way ? ”
47845	47848	47849	47849	I	0	“ No , ”
47853	47932	47849	47849	I	0	“ I ’m telling you that you ca n’t have your cake and eat it , too . You made your choice , so you ’ll live with the consequences . Maybe , you and I can be together in three years , or maybe we ’ll realize that our relationship was over long before you walked away . I honestly do n’t know , Han . What I do know is that I ’m done humoring you . ”
47933	47942	47851	47851	her	720	“ Ares , what does that even mean ? ”
47943	47973	47974	47974	She	721	“ It means that we ’re over . The moment I married Raven , you became my sister - in - law , whether you like it or not . ”
47983	47998	47974	47974	She	721	“ Ares , I know you ’re mad , but do n’t do this . ”
48004	48016	47999	47999	I	0	“ I did n’t do this , Hannah . You did . ”
48027	48082	48017	48017	She	721	“ Ares , I do n’t want to lose you . Please , give me a chance to make this right . Please , honey . This … ca n’t you see how insane this all is ? I ca n’t lose you . I do n’t even know who I am without you . ”
48087	48105	48017	48017	She	721	“ We can try being friends , Han , but that ’s the best I can do . ”
48106	48109	48110	48110	she	721	“ Friends ? ”
48115	48125	48110	48110	she	721	“ How could you and I possibly be friends ? ”
48195	48198	48199	48199	She	721	“ Raven ? ”
48217	48234	48235	48235	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? Should n’t you be all loved up with Ares ? ”
48277	48283	48284	48284	I	0	“ That bad , huh ? ”
48293	48301	48302	48302	Sierra	22	“ He ’s with her right now . ”
48314	48319	48302	48302	Sierra	22	“ He ’s what ? ”
48320	48329	48340	48340	her	721	“ He ’s having dinner with her tonight . ”
48330	48336	48337	48337	she	721	“ You must be kidding , ”
48344	48367	48337	48337	she	721	“ He went for dinner with her a day after you two got married ? What the hell ? Where are they ? ”
48368	48372	48373	48373	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”
48377	48425	48373	48373	I	0	“ Do n’t be crazy today . I ’m here because I did n’t want to be alone in the Hannah Shrine he calls his home . Can we just watch some stupid reality TV show and eat snacks that I should n’t be eating at all ? ”
48444	48539	48431	48431	she	22	“ Now is not the time for snacks , Raven . You spent years loving my brother quietly . You ’re his wife now , Rave . In the Windsor family , that actually means something . All we need to do is make sure Grandma finds out where he is right now , and I can guarantee he ’ll never even attempt to see her again . You ’re Grandma ’s eldest daughter - in - law , and there ’s no way she ’ll allow Ares to mistreat you in any way . ”
48563	48566	48567	48567	I	0	“ Sierra . ”
48572	48622	48567	48567	I	0	“ Let ’s not do that , okay ? Forcibly keeping him away from her wo n’t work in my best interests . He ’ll just want to be with her that much more , and the last thing I need is for him to go behind my back . ”
48634	48639	48625	48625	her	22	“ Come with me . ”
48683	48686	48687	48687	She	22	“ Here . ”
48695	48714	48687	48687	She	22	“ I bought this for you earlier today . I had a feeling you ’d be needing it . ”
48742	48750	48733	48733	I	0	“ This is … this is outrageous . ”
48767	48784	48756	48756	I	0	“ I ’ve done a lot of underwear modeling and this is ridiculous even for me . ”
48801	48817	48785	48785	I	0	“ What ’s the point of this even ? It does n’t have a crotch . ”
48823	48827	48828	48828	She	22	“ Easy access . ”
48854	48881	48843	48843	she	22	“ These are both going to look beautiful on you . They ’re revealing enough to make it impossible for Ares not to notice your body . ”
48896	48902	48903	48903	I	0	“ I ’m not sure , ”
48963	48976	48977	48977	Sierra	22	“ I ’m not sure highlighting my body is a good idea . ”
48991	48997	48998	48998	she	22	“ You ’re an idiot , ”
49001	49040	48998	48998	she	22	“ You ’re one of the most beautiful women alive , and I ’m not even being biased . You ’ve been named that by several magazines . Channel the confidence you exude on the runway , Rave . ”
49051	49065	49041	49041	I	0	“ Look , Sierra … there ’s something I have n’t told you . ”
49077	49097	49098	49098	She	22	“ Remember that night we went out and Ares came to pick us up because we were so drunk ? ”
49137	49178	49179	49179	She	22	“ He was n’t even remotely tempted , Sierra . A small part of me thought that I could get him to fold if I truly gave it my all , but I could n’t . He was n’t moved . ”
49187	49271	49184	49184	her	22	“ I really doubt that , Rave . Even if that ’s the case , it ’s different now . You were unattainable to him before , but you ’re his wife now . If he repeatedly sees you in various states of undress , he ’s going to end up wanting you , even if he does n’t right now . He wo n’t be able to stay away from you for three years , and he wo n’t cheat on you . ”
49280	49283	49284	49284	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
49287	49296	49284	49284	I	0	“ I do n’t think he ’ll cheat . ”
49310	49451	49306	49306	she	731	“ If you two end up sleeping together , he ’ll end up falling for you . I know you think he ’ll never stop loving your sister , but I call bullshit . He ’s always looked at you a certain way , and there ’s always been this unshakeable bond between you two . He just needs a push . Ares is a man of morals , and so long as he thinks he ’s doing right by both Hannah and you by staying away , he will . Give him a reason to fold . Honestly , if you just outright tell him you want him to meet your physical needs , he ’d fall as fast as a house of cards . I know he wants you . He just wo n’t admit it to himself . ”
49505	49509	49510	49510	she	22	“ Trust me , ”
49514	49611	49510	49510	she	22	“ I know my brother , and he does not just see you as Hannah ’s sister . If you are n’t comfortable with pursuing him directly , then just do this much , okay ? Just wear the nightgowns I bought you and see how he responds to that . Just seduce him , slowly , until he gives in and comes to you . Watch his actions , Rave . I ’m certain he ’ll betray himself sooner or later . He wants you … and the line between lust and love is thin . ”
49636	49643	49644	49644	I	0	“ Just try it , Rave . ”
49647	49669	49644	49644	I	0	“ Fine . I ’ll try it , but if it backfires , you ’ll never hear the end of it . ”
49670	49675	49676	49676	she	735	“ It wo n’t , ”
49797	49803	49804	49804	I	0	“ Where have you been ? ”
49812	49815	49816	49816	She	24	“ Ares . ”
49824	49830	49818	49818	her	24	“ You ’re up early . ”
49847	49854	49831	49831	I	0	“ I asked you a question . ”
49877	49884	49885	49885	I	0	“ Where . Were . You ? ”
49897	49922	49888	49888	She	24	“ Do you have any right to ask me that after you went for dinner with my sister ? Do n’t be a hypocrite . ”
49938	49952	49923	49923	I	0	“ I do have that right , Raven . I ’m your husband . ”
49961	49970	49971	49971	she	24	“ You certainly do n’t act like it , ”
49980	50015	49971	49971	she	24	“ You went for dinner with Hannah a day after marrying me . Did you even come home last night , or did you just get in ? Did you fuck her , Ares ? ”
50032	50039	50040	50040	I	0	“ What did you just say ? ”
50046	50052	50040	50040	I	0	“ Did I fuck her ? ”
50082	50085	50086	50086	I	0	“ No , ”
50089	50125	50086	50086	I	0	“ I did n’t fuck her , Raven . Of course I did n’t . I promised you fidelity , and I always keep my promises . Do you truly think so little of me ? ”
50146	50157	50158	50158	she	24	“ I do n’t know what to think , Ares , ”
50161	50195	50158	50158	she	24	“ I never thought we ’d find ourselves in this situation , but now that we ’re here , I ’m not willing to stand aside and let you chase after your happiness . ”
50208	50292	50196	50196	I	0	“ I get it . You made sacrifices , and I can acknowledge that much . Perhaps it was wrong of me to go for dinner with Hannah , but I thought it would be best to get that conversation out of the way . I did n’t go see her because I missed her or wanted alone - time with her , Rave . I went to see her so I could put proper boundaries in place and end things with her . ”
50297	50301	50293	50293	Her	24	“ You did ? ”
50317	50382	50302	50302	I	0	“ Of course I did . Maybe she and I will find our way back together in a few years . Who knows ? But in the meantime , she ca n’t be more than a friend to me . I wo n’t betray you . Hannah made her choice , and she ’ll have to live with it the same way we do . ”
50425	50430	50431	50431	I	0	“ Where were you ? ”
50440	50444	50445	50445	she	24	“ Sierra ’s , ”
50463	50539	50457	50457	I	0	“ Do n’t stay away from home without notifying me and pick up when I call you . It is n’t just because we ca n’t spend much time apart , but also because I was worried , Rave . I know you did n’t want to get married , but you are now , and it comes with some new responsibilities . One of them is keeping me informed of this kind of thing . ”
50540	50543	50544	50544	she	24	“ Home , ”
50554	50561	50562	50562	she	24	“ This is n’t my home , ”
50568	50583	50562	50562	she	24	“ I ’m not even sure it ’s yours . It ’s Hannah ’s . ”
50638	50641	50642	50642	I	0	“ Raven , ”
50646	50689	50642	50642	I	0	“ I meant what I said when you and I got married . It is n’t what either of us wanted , but we ’re married now . I ’ll do right by you , starting with a formal announcement next month . ”
50690	50693	50694	50694	she	24	“ What ? ”
50701	50705	50694	50694	she	24	“ I thought … ”
50706	50787	50788	50788	Raven	24	“ You thought we ’d keep our marriage a secret ? We ca n’t . Rumors about our wedding have already started to spread . We ’re much better off confirming the gossip . I refuse to sneak around with my own damn wife . Besides , do you really think Grandma would let us get away with that ? If we do n’t break the news , she will . This way , we at least control the narrative . ”
50795	50822	50791	50791	her	24	“ What will you do in three years ? How will you explain to the media that you ’re divorcing your wife to marry her sister ? ”
50823	50855	50856	50856	She	24	“ I ’ll tell them the truth . I ’ll prove that Hannah and I have been dating for years , but that you and I were forced to get married . ”
50872	50905	50867	50867	she	24	“ I ’d rather keep it a secret , Ares . I do n’t want to be the jilted wife . I do n’t want to be the villain in your story . ”
50937	50963	50926	50926	I	0	“ I wo n’t be your dirty little secret , Mrs. Windsor . You carry my name , and you ’ll do it with pride . ”
51006	51043	50983	50983	she	24	“ I only suggested it because I think it ’d be in your best interests , Ares . I wo n’t hide our marriage if you do n’t want me to . I ’m not her . ”
51081	51085	51086	51086	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”
51100	51143	51086	51086	I	0	“ Do n’t hide our marriage . I ’ll be making a formal announcement on my social media channels four weeks from now , and I highly recommend that you do the same . Our PR team is working on our statements . ”
51151	51174	51144	51144	She	24	“ Sure . Just tell me when . I ’ve got a cute photo from our wedding that I want to share . ”
51398	51401	51402	51402	she	24	“ Morning , ”
51412	51415	51402	51402	she	24	“ Morning . ”
51642	51645	51632	51632	I	0	“ Ares ? ”
51659	51670	51646	51646	I	0	“ I asked if you wanted another cup of coffee ? ”
51683	51717	51677	51677	my	0	“ No , thank you . There ’s some breakfast for you in the fridge . Donna told me you have n’t been eating much ? Is the food not to your liking ? ”
51728	51754	51725	51725	her	24	“ No , it ’s not that . I just … I ca n’t eat much , Ares . I ’m a model , remember ? ”
51782	51806	51768	51768	my	0	“ Rave , you can afford to eat a little more . You ’d still be the sexiest woman alive , you know ? ”
51816	51821	51813	51813	she	24	“ Is that so ? ”
51891	51896	51897	51897	she	24	“ Can we stop ? ”
51904	51908	51897	51897	she	24	“ Stop what ? ”
51909	51912	51913	51913	she	24	“ This , ”
51916	51960	51913	51913	she	24	“ Dancing around each other , avoiding each other . We ’ve been married for a week and I ’ve barely seen you , much less spoken to you . Why is that I feel like I lost one of my closest friends ? ”
51985	51988	51989	51989	I	0	“ Rave , ”
51992	52054	51989	51989	I	0	“ I just … I thought it would be good to give you space . The last couple of days have been a lot for both of us . I was worried I ’d make you uncomfortable . Being in each other ’s personal space like that , I ’m not sure . I just did n’t want to overwhelm you . ”
52075	52079	52080	52080	she	24	“ You are , ”
52084	52138	52080	52080	she	24	“ You are making me uncomfortable by keeping your distance . It ’s weird , and I hate it . We ’ve always been friends , Ares . Why does that need to change ? Surely marriage should ’ve brought us closer ? Do you truly hate being married to me that much ? ”
52156	52167	52168	52168	I	0	“ What ? No , Raven . What the fuck ? ”
52231	52263	52293	52293	her	24	“ I just feel guilty , Rave . I ’m pissed off at Hannah , and I ’m mad at myself for doing this to you . Fuck . I just … ”
52434	52441	52442	52442	she	24	“ I ’ll never be her , ”
52446	52549	52442	52442	she	24	“ I know that , Ares . I know I ’m not the woman you want to wake up to . I know you ca n’t stand having me in your bed at night . I get it . I know you ’re hurting , Ares . But please … please do n’t distance yourself from me . If asking you to treat me as your wife is too much , then all I ’ll ask for is your friendship . I miss you , Ares . What do I do ? How do I make my presence more bearable for you ? ”
52550	52553	52554	52554	I	0	“ Bearable ? ”
52559	52565	52554	52554	I	0	“ Fucking hell , Cupcake . ”
52598	52605	52606	52606	I	0	“ I ’m so fucking sorry . ”
52614	52698	52606	52606	I	0	“ It ’s not you , baby . Your presence in my home does n’t make me even remotely uncomfortable . It ’s quite the opposite . I ’m worried being around me is uncomfortable for you . I ’ll be honest with you , Rave , I ’m having a hard time processing everything that happened . It ’s hard to believe that you ’re my wife now , and I ca n’t quite figure out what that even means for us . ”
52710	52769	52699	52699	She	752	“ Did n’t we agree that we do n’t have to figure it out right away ? I can tell you this much , though : there ’s nowhere else I ’d rather be . There is n’t much you could do that ’d make me uncomfortable , and if you do , I ’ll simply tell you . ”
52778	52814	52770	52770	She	752	“ These lips excel at complaining about things . I ’m not some meek woman you need to protect , Ares . I would n’t be here if I had n’t chosen to marry you . ”
52885	52890	52891	52891	I	0	“ I hear you , ”
52894	52903	52891	52891	I	0	“ I ’ll do better from now on . ”
52907	52915	52904	52904	She	752	“ No more avoiding me , okay ? ”
52916	52920	52925	52925	Raven	24	“ I promise . ”
53062	53065	53057	53057	I	0	“ Mom ? ”
53081	53095	53096	53096	She	166	“ Raven , I ’ve been calling you for over an hour now . ”
53109	53116	53096	53096	She	166	“ What took you so long ? ”
53130	53179	53117	53117	I	0	“ I had a shoot that ran late because no matter what we did , the photographer was n’t satisfied with the shots . I ’m exhausted , Mom . I went straight home after it , so most of your calls came in while I was driving . ”
53180	53207	53208	53208	I	0	“ Raven , does n’t your car have a hands - free function ? Goodness . Surely it ’s not that hard to set that up ? ”
53255	53264	53265	53265	She	759	“ What are you calling for , Mom ? ”
53271	53369	53265	53265	She	759	“ Hannah has been very upset all week . She has n’t left her apartment , and each time I go over to check up on her , I find her crying . I do n’t know what to do , Rave . Do you think you could speak to her ? I asked her if she ’d heard from you , and she told me you have n’t even called her once . How could you do that , Raven ? You know how sensitive she is and how badly she needs us all right now . ”
53453	53456	53457	53457	I	0	“ Mom , ”
53461	53603	53457	53457	I	0	“ The only reason I married Ares is because she refused to . I ’m not sure I understand what you want from me . In a matter of days , I ’ve lost everything . I ’ve had to leave my apartment , the home I built and loved , to move in with someone who does n’t want me here . How do you think I ’m feeling ? What do you think it ’s like to be married to someone who avoids me because looking at me reminds me of the woman he ’d rather see ? Do n’t you think Hannah owes me an apology for making me take responsibility for her selfishness ? Do n’t tell me to call her and console her because this mess that we ’re both trapped in is of her making . ”
53604	53610	53611	53611	she	763	“ You selfish little girl , ”
53614	53759	53611	53611	she	763	“ You ’ll never change , will you ? You will never have it in you to be the bigger person , will you ? Ca n’t you see that this is going to ruin your relationship with your sister ? Hannah is n’t going to reach out because she ’s heartbroken , and she ’s never been good at telling us when she ’s in pain . You know exactly why that is , Raven . It ’s the result of years and years of her being sick , of feeling like a burden . I ’m not saying Hannah is n’t wrong , but so are you . We both know that your marriage to Ares is just temporary , so why not just make her feel better ? Would it really kill you to pick up the phone and reassure her ? ”
53760	53772	53773	53773	Mom	32	“ Would it kill her to do the same for me ? ”
53776	53815	53773	53773	Mom	32	“ I ’m so incredibly disappointed in you , Raven . I do n’t understand how you two can both be my daughters when you ’re so different . I wish you could be more like your sister . ”
53820	53847	53816	53816	I	0	“ Yeah , join the club , Mom . Everyone wishes I could be Hannah , but I ’m not . I ’ll never be her . ”
53862	53865	53866	53866	Mom	32	“ No , ”
53869	53896	53897	53897	She	764	“ You ’ll never be her , but you can at least try to be half the woman she is . Call your sister , Raven . ”
53966	53969	53970	53970	I	0	“ Raven . ”
54021	54024	54025	54025	he	25	“ Cupcake , ”
54032	54040	54025	54025	he	25	“ I do n’t want your pity . ”
54099	54128	54129	54129	He	25	“ Or is it not pity you ’re offering me ? Let me guess , you agree that I should call your precious Hannah , do n’t you ? ”
54151	54167	54141	54141	I	0	“ Forget it . Whatever it is , I do n’t need to hear it . ”
54186	54212	54176	54176	he	25	“ Cupcake , all I wanted to ask is if you ’ve had time to eat today . Shall I warm something up for you ? ”
54222	54225	54226	54226	I	0	“ No , ”
54234	54252	54226	54226	I	0	“ Thank you , Ares , but I just … I ’m going to bed early tonight . ”
55317	55320	55321	55321	I	0	“ Rave , ”
55461	55464	55465	55465	she	24	“ Ares , ”
55478	55487	55465	55465	she	24	“ I … Can I have a hug ? ”
55598	55606	55607	55607	I	0	“ You never even need to ask , ”
55677	55684	55685	55685	She	24	“ Are you okay , Cupcake ? ”
55700	55707	55708	55708	She	24	“ I do n’t think so . ”
55771	55791	55792	55792	She	24	“ Talk to me , baby . Tell me what ’s going on in that beautiful mind of yours . ”
55829	55929	55930	55930	She	24	“ It ’s just too much , Ares . I feel … I feel so unwanted . So unloved . I just … I feel like a failure , like no matter what I do , I wo n’t ever be what anyone wants me to be . Even work was a nightmare today , and I just … how could I fail so miserably ? It ’s one thing to fail at everything else in life , but my career is my escape . I just … today I just really needed one single win . Just one . ”
56004	56058	55997	55997	I	0	“ And then there ’s my mother and you . You both want me to be something I ’m not , someone I ’m not , and it hurts . Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m not blaming you at all . I get it . I really do , but — ”
56059	56063	56066	56066	her	800	“ — no , ”
56069	56078	56064	56064	I	0	“ you do n’t get it , Raven . ”
56158	56350	56151	56151	her	800	“ I do n’t need you to be anything or anyone else . Not ever . You ’re my wife , Raven . You . No one else . You do n’t need to compare yourself to anyone else , and you do n’t need to measure up to anyone else either — because whether you realize it or not , you ’ve already surpassed every standard anyone has ever set for you . Just because they wo n’t or ca n’t acknowledge it does n’t mean you ’re anything short of amazing . You ’re perfect the way you are . And no , I ’m not saying that to placate you . I ’m telling you that because it ’s true . You have a sense of loyalty so strong that you married me and sacrificed the future you envisioned for yourself . You ’re fucking beautiful , and you ’re smart , real smart . How many women do you know that have a full - time modeling career and a thriving business ? Fuck anyone who ca n’t see your worth , Rave . Fuck them all . ”
56351	56355	56356	56356	I	0	“ Including you ? ”
56373	56376	56377	56377	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
56387	56392	56377	56377	I	0	“ Fuck me too . ”
56463	56495	56496	56496	I	0	“ In all seriousness , Rave … I ’m sorry I was one of the reasons you were upset today . I ’m so fucking sorry , you have no idea . ”
56512	56651	56502	56502	her	802	“ I want you here , Raven . There is no one I ’d rather have in my bed than you . No one . You may not believe that , but it ’s true . From the moment I married you , you ’ve had my loyalty right down to my every thought . There ’s no one on my mind but you . When I look at you , all I see is my wife . Nothing else . No one else . There ’s no space for anyone but you — not in my mind , and not in my heart . This may all sound like pretty lies and a poor attempt to console you , and I get that , but baby , over time you ’ll realize that it ’s the truth . ”
56675	56843	56844	56844	She	805	“ I never meant to make you feel like you ’re unwanted , because you are n’t . Do you have any idea how much it means to me that you chose to marry me ? You could ’ve walked away from everything and left me to deal with the consequences , but you did n’t . You were there for me when I needed you most , Rave , and I ’ve done a really shitty job of thanking you for it . I ’ll do better , okay ? I just … it was hard for me too , and I was foolish to assume I knew what you needed . I ’m learning the hard way that I only ever knew a small part of you , and it ’ll take me a little bit of time to discover the rest . Will you give me that , Rave ? Will you give me some grace ? Will you forgive me for fucking up ? ”
56966	56974	56975	56975	she	805	“ I ’ll give you some grace , ”
56978	57056	56975	56975	she	805	“ On one condition . Honor my request , Ares . No assumptions , no overthinking . Please , Ares . Please communicate with me . Do you know how hard it was for me to admit how I ’ve been feeling ? I just … all week I ’ve felt like I was losing you , and I … I just do n’t want to be kept guessing . Please do n’t do that to me . ”
57078	57083	57084	57084	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
57104	57146	57147	57147	She	805	“ I promise to communicate from now on , no matter how hard it is . It ’s just … I ’m so used to all these fucking mind games that this is … it ’s new to me , Rave . ”
57159	57176	57147	57147	She	805	“ You give me honesty , and I ’ll give you grace . How about that ? ”
57236	57239	57240	57240	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
57243	57247	57240	57240	I	0	“ I promise . ”
57259	57290	57248	57248	She	805	“ Then give me a moment of honesty , Ares . Tell me one thing no one else knows ? Give me a part of you no one else has . ”
57303	57326	57248	57248	She	805	“ You already have my last name , Raven . It ’s the one thing I ’ll never give to anyone else . ”
57327	57330	57331	57331	I	0	“ Never ? ”
57392	57395	57384	57384	she	805	“ Never , ”
57487	57493	57479	57479	she	805	“ Feel better , Cupcake ? ”
57723	57727	57728	57728	she	812	“ Mr. Windsor , ”
57734	57755	57728	57728	she	812	“ Hello . I apologize for barging in unexpectedly . Could you tell me where I can find my wife ? ”
57767	57774	57756	57756	She	812	“ Raven is in her office . ”
57893	57896	57897	57897	She	814	“ Ares ? ”
57959	57962	57963	57963	I	0	“ Cupcake , ”
57981	57988	57969	57969	She	814	“ What are you doing here ? ”
58054	58066	58067	58067	I	0	“ Why ? Ca n’t I surprise my wife at work ? ”
58228	58236	58237	58237	she	24	“ This is definitely a pleasant surprise , ”
58299	58308	58309	58309	she	24	“ This is my husband , Ares Windsor , ”
58340	58351	58352	58352	he	67	“ I suppose the rumors are true , after all , ”
58384	58410	58379	58379	her	24	“ Diego and I are collaborating on a new fashion line . We ’re co - designing some pieces that I ’m really excited about . ”
58480	58501	58502	58502	I	0	“ I ca n’t wait to see your designs , Cupcake . I have no doubt they ’ll be phenomenal , ”
58547	58573	58543	58543	she	24	“ I want a bit of your time today , Rave . I brought my laptop so I can wait for you while you work . ”
58578	58601	58602	58602	She	24	“ Oh ! Well , I ’m actually just about done . I can do the rest of my work from home . ”
58617	58634	58611	58611	she	24	“ I ’ll wrap up the revisions we discussed today and send them over to you . ”
58674	58685	58686	58686	he	67	“ Then I will see you again soon , beautiful , ”
58715	58725	58726	58726	I	0	“ Why was he standing so close to you ? ”
58747	58756	58739	58739	she	24	“ I was fixing his tie for him . ”
58757	58764	58765	58765	I	0	“ Do n’t do that again , ”
58773	58783	58765	58765	I	0	“ The only man you ’re touching is me . ”
58808	58815	58805	58805	she	24	“ Is that so , Ares ? ”
58834	58845	58824	58824	she	24	“ What if I have needs you ca n’t fulfill ? ”
58929	58941	58942	58942	I	0	“ Cupcake , there ’s no need I ca n’t fulfill , ”
58968	59027	59028	59028	She	24	“ You will not turn toward anyone but me , you hear me ? If you want sex , I ’ll give it to you . I ’ll fuck you right here on this fucking desk if you want me to . Do n’t even fucking dream of being with anyone else . Am I making myself clear ? ”
59297	59305	59306	59306	she	24	“ What are you even doing here ? ”
59325	59346	59347	59347	I	0	“ There ’s somewhere I want to take you today . I suppose it ’s a surprise of some sort , ”
59355	59358	59347	59347	I	0	“ Where ? ”
59371	59376	59366	59366	she	24	“ You ’ll see . ”
59536	59541	59542	59542	she	24	“ Where are we ? ”
59560	59569	59542	59542	she	24	“ You ’ll see . Let ’s go . ”
59659	59703	59650	59650	I	0	“ I want you to know that I have every intention of keeping my promises to you , Rave . You told me my home does n’t feel like ours , and you ’re right . So let ’s fix that , okay ? ”
59720	59724	59725	59725	she	24	“ Castello Designs , ”

61059	61075	61042	61042	She	24	“ I ’m not sure . I guess this is still just new to us ? ”
61096	61116	61076	61076	I	0	“ Is it , though ? You fell asleep in my arms on the sofa not that long ago . ”
61133	61161	61124	61124	she	24	“ Did you have to remind me of that ? I ’m so embarrassed about my behavior that night , Ares . I ca n’t apologize enough . ”

61188	61206	61185	61185	I	0	“ I did n’t mind it one bit , despite what I might have told you then . ”
61233	61242	61243	61243	she	24	“ This is not so bad , right ? ”
61247	61275	61243	61243	she	24	“ That night you told me that you ’d never want me , and I know that . I know I ’ll never be Hannah , but … ”
61276	61280	61281	61281	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”

61381	61390	61375	61375	I	0	“ Let ’s just order a new one . ”
61403	61413	61414	61414	I	0	“ Can we throw these out too , then ? ”
61427	61448	61449	61449	I	0	“ I know Hannah and you have matching pajamas , and maybe it ’s petty and immature , but I … ”
61469	61477	61449	61449	I	0	“ So take it off , wife . ”
61629	61645	61646	61646	She	24	“ You said you wanted it off , baby . So take it all off . ”

61991	61997	61998	61998	I	0	“ Oh , I remember , ”
62020	62041	62042	62042	I	0	“ Remind me , that recent underwear campaign you did … it was something like this , was n’t it ? ”
62082	62116	62117	62117	I	0	“ This is how you posed with Tom Foster , was n’t it ? Tell me , my love , was he as hard as I am when he held you like this ? ”
62171	62174	62175	62175	she	24	“ No , ”
62185	62222	62175	62175	she	24	“ He ’s very professional . The shoots are n’t as intimate as they look , I promise . There are so many people around , and we move from one position to another very quickly . ”
62235	62238	62239	62239	I	0	“ Good , ”
62243	62260	62239	62239	I	0	“ Good for him . He ’ll get to produce co2 for another day , then . ”

62330	62367	62368	62368	She	24	“ I never was . Not until you . You … yeah , you changed the game . I want all of you , Raven . I need you to be mine in every single way . ”

63032	63053	63026	63026	I	0	“ I ’ll pay the penalty . I ’ll do anything if you ’ll just let me keep kissing you . ”
63072	63075	63076	63076	she	24	“ No , ”
63080	63095	63076	63076	she	24	“ That ’s not who I am . I hate being irresponsible like that . ”
63203	63208	63191	63191	I	0	“ What the fuck ? ”
63228	63235	63209	63209	I	0	“ Who the fuck is this ? ”
63266	63270	63271	63271	she	24	“ No idea , ”
63279	63287	63271	63271	she	24	“ I get these all the time . ”
63358	63361	63362	63362	She	24	“ Raven . ”
63380	63389	63370	63370	I	0	“ Where the fuck is your wedding ring ? ”
63399	63405	63395	63395	she	24	“ I took it off . ”
63406	63417	63418	63418	She	24	“ What do you mean , you took it off ? ”
63432	63459	63418	63418	She	24	“ It just … it ’s very much Hannah ’s style , but it is n’t mine . It does n’t feel right to wear it . ”
63489	63493	63494	63494	I	0	“ Next week , ”
63505	63522	63494	63494	I	0	“ We ’ll buy you a new ring next week , and you will wear it . ”
63804	63807	63797	63797	I	0	“ Ares ? ”
63808	63811	63933	63933	She	884	“ Hannah . ”
63812	63881	63882	63882	I	0	“ God , I missed you so much . I just … why have you been declining my calls ? I know you ’re mad at me , Ares , I get it . I really fucked up this time , and I know I hurt you , but please do n’t ignore me like that . You know I ca n’t take it when you do that . ”
63893	63932	63882	63882	I	0	“ Has it ever occurred to you that my needs might differ from yours ? Yeah , Han , I know you ca n’t take the silent treatment , but what I need above everything else is space . ”
63940	64026	63933	63933	She	884	“ Ares , I … what ’s gotten into you ? You … you ’ve never treated me this way before . I really am sorry , honey . I swear to you that I did n’t know they ’d make Raven do this . I did n’t mean to get us entangled in this crazy situation . Do you really think I wanted you to marry my sister ? Do you have any idea how upset I am she let it happen at all ? ”
64039	64057	63933	63933	She	884	“ It is n’t her fault . You do n’t get to blame her for your choices . ”
64058	64096	64136	64136	Raven	24	“ Ares ! None of this would ’ve happened if she ’d just stayed away . I ’m not sure what she was thinking . I suppose it ’s Mom and Dad ’s company she ’s after . ”
64120	64135	64106	64106	Raven	24	“ Look , I need to go . I ’ll talk to you later . ”
64197	64202	64203	64203	she	24	“ Who was that ? ”
64213	64216	64210	64210	I	0	“ Hannah . ”
64250	64256	64257	64257	I	0	“ It was n’t anything , ”
64264	64286	64257	64257	I	0	“ I told her we could be friends , but I ’d been ignoring her messages , so she called me . ”
64297	64300	64301	64301	she	24	“ Friends , ”
64310	64313	64314	64314	I	0	“ Rave , ”
64534	64540	64527	64527	I	0	“ Come here , Rave . ”
64577	64607	64566	64566	I	0	“ Check . I have n’t replied to any of her messages . Check my call history . Today is the first time I picked up when she called . ”
64608	64615	64616	64616	she	24	“ You think I wo n’t ? ”
64625	64660	64619	64619	I	0	“ Baby , I gave you my phone because I want you to check . This is n’t me playing games with you . This is me giving you the honesty you asked for . ”
64691	64695	64696	64696	she	24	“ Never mind , ”
64704	64715	64696	64696	she	24	“ I do n’t need to see any of that . ”
64725	64757	64716	64716	I	0	“ You asked for honesty , did n’t you ? So give me a moment of honesty . I want to know why you just looked at my phone that way . ”
64766	64787	64758	64758	Raven	24	“ Do you remember that day that Grandma made cookies , and you filmed Sierra and me fighting over them ? ”
64851	64898	64846	64846	she	281	“ When I deleted that video , I saw the last photo you took . It was a photo of Hannah , in bed . I do n’t want to go through your phone because I do n’t want to be confronted with any of that . ”
64913	64916	64917	64917	I	0	“ Grace , ”
64921	64929	64917	64917	I	0	“ Will you give me some grace ? ”
64941	64970	64930	64930	She	281	“ You did n’t do anything wrong , Ares . I ’m not … I ’m not mad at you . I ’m mostly just mad at myself . ”
64982	65131	64979	64979	my	0	“ No , baby . You ’re my wife . It does n’t matter how or why we got married — all that matters is that we ’re married now . You better believe I ’d be pissed as fuck if you were going around calling your ex , so yeah , I did do something wrong . If it ’s not behavior I ’d accept from you , it is n’t something I should be doing myself . You and I will need to talk about if and how Hannah is going to be part of our lives , but that is n’t something we need to do right now . How about we both think about it , and once you ’ve decided what your boundaries are in relation to Hannah and me , you let me know ? Whatever you decide , I will honor . ”
65139	65155	65132	65132	She	894	“ What if I decide that I never want you to speak to her again ? ”
65161	65187	65156	65156	I	0	“ Then I wo n’t . You are my wife , Raven . I will always put you above anyone and everything else . Always . ”
65584	65593	65594	65594	She	24	“ You ’re home earlier than I expected . ”
65601	65628	65594	65594	She	24	“ I fell on set . My back has been hurting all day , so I figured I ’d just work on my designs from home . ”
65639	65649	65650	65650	She	24	“ You ’re hurt ? How did that happen ? ”
65657	65680	65654	65654	her	24	“ I was just being clumsy . I ’ve been absentminded all day . This honestly really was all my own fault . ”
65830	65834	65835	65835	I	0	“ Come on , ”
65839	65858	65835	65835	I	0	“ Take a hot shower to relax your muscles , and then I ’ll give you a massage . ”
65977	65980	65981	65981	I	0	“ Ares ? ”
66000	66004	66005	66005	I	0	“ Come here , ”
66013	66017	66005	66005	I	0	“ Lie down . ”
66093	66100	66083	66083	I	0	“ Let me move this aside . ”
66192	66198	66199	66199	I	0	“ Are my hands cold ? ”
66217	66224	66213	66213	Raven	24	“ No , this is perfect . ”
66257	66261	66262	66262	she	24	“ Oh God , ”
66265	66271	66262	66262	she	24	“ That ’s so good . ”
66306	66309	66310	66310	she	24	“ Ares , ”
66339	66344	66332	66332	she	24	“ I love this . ”
66345	66354	66355	66355	I	0	“ Let me move on top of you , ”
66587	66592	66593	66593	she	24	“ Do n’t stop , ”
66646	66649	66650	66650	she	24	“ Oh , ”
66654	66657	66650	66650	she	24	“ Hurts . ”
66658	66663	66664	66664	I	0	“ Here , baby ? ”
66695	66698	66699	66699	she	24	“ Yeah , ”
66702	66705	66699	66699	she	24	“ There . ”
67176	67183	67184	67184	I	0	“ Spread your legs for me , ”
67194	67205	67184	67184	I	0	“ Let me work on the muscles in your thighs . ”
67290	67293	67294	67294	I	0	“ Sorry , ”
67297	67315	67294	67294	I	0	“ I think I used too much , baby . Let me clean that up for you . ”
67384	67391	67392	67392	I	0	“ I used too much oil , ”
67405	67410	67411	67411	she	24	“ It ’s okay , ”
67414	67426	67411	67411	she	24	“ Just rub it in . My skin will absorb it . ”
67427	67430	67431	67431	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
67481	67486	67487	67487	I	0	“ So much oil , ”
67578	67583	67584	67584	I	0	“ Ares , please . ”
67630	67635	67636	67636	I	0	“ Yeah , baby , ”
67644	67649	67636	67636	I	0	“ Just like that . ”
67805	67824	67793	67793	I	0	“ You may need to take another shower , Wifey . I got oil all over your body . ”
67825	67828	67829	67829	she	24	“ Yeah , ”
67832	67846	67829	67829	she	24	“ I , um , I ’ll just go take another shower now . ”
67856	67881	67847	67847	I	0	“ I ’ve got a conference call in a few minutes , so just relax for a bit before you shower , my love . ”
68115	68118	68109	68109	I	0	“ Raven ? ”
68132	68135	68136	68136	she	26	“ Hi , ”
68165	68168	68169	68169	I	0	“ Hi , ”
68201	68206	68207	68207	she	26	“ I ’m sorry , ”
68220	68312	68207	68207	she	26	“ I … I should ’ve come to see you sooner , Rave . I have n’t been in a good state of mind recently . I guess it took me a bit of time to think everything through , you know ? When I walked away from Ares , I just … I guess I did n’t quite realize what I was doing . I ’d postponed the wedding so many times , and I ’d gotten away with it . I thought it ’d be the same this time . ”
68323	68329	68313	68313	I	0	“ But it was n’t . ”
68330	68333	68334	68334	she	912	“ No , ”
68337	68342	68334	68334	she	912	“ It was n’t . ”
68353	68366	68351	68351	her	912	“ I told you , Han . I begged you to reconsider . ”
68367	68389	68390	68390	I	0	“ I know . I know , Rave . What do you want me to say ? That you were right ? ”
68398	68407	68390	68390	I	0	“ No , Hannah . Of course not . ”
68408	68420	68421	68421	I	0	“ You ’re mad at me too , are n’t you ? ”
68432	68543	68421	68421	I	0	“ I was , initially . Now ? I do n’t even know how I ’m feeling now . I guess I ’m just hurt and disappointed . You may have broken Ares ’s heart , Hannah , but you broke mine too . You did n’t listen to any of my concerns and played with my life without any regard for my wishes and dreams . Do you have any idea how used and manipulated I feel ? You ’re my big sister , Han . You ’re the one person in this world that ’s supposed to look out for me , yet you never did . Never . ”
68544	68567	68568	68568	I	0	“ Raven , you know that is n’t true . Was n’t I the one who got you your first modeling gig ? ”
68579	68609	68568	68568	I	0	“ No , Hannah . All you did was bring me with you to one of your premieres . I was scouted and signed without any endorsements from you . ”
68617	68657	68614	68614	her	913	“ You would n’t have been there without me , but forget it . That is n’t the point . I ’m just trying to say that I do try to look out for you in my own way . ”
68663	68690	68614	68614	her	913	“ Not everything can always be your way , Han . You do n’t get to decide whether I feel like you ’re there for me . ”
68691	68699	68700	68700	Her	913	“ So you are mad at me . ”
68719	68727	68728	68728	She	913	“ Why are you here , Hannah ? ”
68736	68764	68728	68728	She	913	“ The last time I was here , I was trying on my wedding dress . I did n’t even get to wear it in the end . ”
68816	68827	68813	68813	her	26	“ I bet it looked beautiful on you , though . ”
68869	68884	68885	68885	I	0	“ Is he nice to you , Rave ? Does he treat you well ? ”
68927	68955	68956	68956	I	0	“ I ’m worried about you . He ’s a good man , but I ’m worried he ’ll take his anger at me out on you . ”
68967	68976	68977	68977	I	0	“ Ares and I have always been friends , ”
68985	69004	68977	68977	I	0	“ That has n’t changed . He ’s still as nice to me as he ’s always been . ”
69022	69031	69032	69032	She	915	“ That ’s good . I ’m glad . ”
69071	69084	69085	69085	she	915	“ I know that the Windsors value marriage above almost everything else , ”
69089	69111	69085	69085	she	915	“ Ares is no different . There ’s nothing he wo n’t do out of loyalty , regardless of his feelings . ”
69123	69247	69117	69117	she	915	“ I know he still loves me , and he always will , but he ’s hurting so badly right now that he ’s pushing me away . I think that , in part , it ’s because he feels like he has to distance himself from me simply because he ’s married now . I know he needs me , yet he refuses to let me in because it goes against his beliefs about marriage . I do n’t want to see him hurting , Rave . I know he ’s mad at me , and I know I caused a great deal of pain . I want to make up for it , but he wo n’t even take my calls . ”
69269	69345	69117	69117	she	915	“ Please , Rave . Tell him to talk to me . I know my request sounds ridiculous , especially because your marriage is n’t real . You said it yourself , the two of you are just friends , and considering how much he loves me , it ’ll never be more than that , but he just … he has such a strong sense of loyalty . Remind him that it ’s misplaced . ”
69364	69396	69397	69397	She	917	“ You are n’t here to apologize for what you did to me , are you ? You ’re here because you need me to talk to Ares on your behalf . ”
69404	69580	69399	69399	her	917	“ Why ca n’t I be here to do both , Raven ? I love both of you , and honestly , this is in your best interests , too . It ca n’t be easy for you to be caught between us . Do n’t you want things to go back to how they used to be ? I ’m trying to relieve some of the pressure that this marriage has put on you . I ca n’t take away the countless social obligations you ’ll have now , but I can be there to support you with everything else . With me to rely on , Ares wo n’t expect too much from you , and you wo n’t lose so much of your own life . After all , eventually , you ’ll have to go back to it , wo n’t you ? You know he does n’t want you . He broke off your engagement to be with me five years ago , and it ’s still me he wants . ”
69636	69639	69640	69640	I	0	“ No , ”
69648	69697	69640	69640	I	0	“ I wo n’t talk to Ares for you . He ’s not a child , and I ’m not a mediator . Do n’t ask me for more than I ’ve already given you , Hannah , because there ’s not much left of me to give . ”
69788	69791	69792	69792	I	0	“ Cupcake ? ”
69823	69826	69827	69827	he	25	“ Morning , ”
69850	69865	69839	69839	he	25	“ You came to bed so late last night . Did you sleep okay ? ”
69950	69962	69963	69963	I	0	“ Yeah , just had a lot of work to finish , ”
70205	70213	70214	70214	Ares	25	“ Let me help you with that . ”
70293	70314	70276	70276	Ares	25	“ You ’re quiet , Cupcake . Give me a moment of honesty , baby . What are you thinking ? ”
70359	70366	70367	70367	I	0	“ Hannah came to see me , ”
70382	70399	70375	70375	I	0	“ She wants to talk to you . She says you ’ve been declining her calls . ”
70411	70415	70400	70400	He	25	“ Really now ? ”
70427	70451	70420	70420	Ares	25	“ And what would you like me to do ? Tell me the truth . What would you have me do , wife ? ”
70462	70481	70452	70452	I	0	“ I do n’t want your eyes on anyone but me . I want you to be mine . ”
70520	70543	70514	70514	he	25	“ Give me another moment of honesty , baby . These stretches ? Do you ever do them with any other men ? ”
70560	70566	70551	70551	his	25	“ Only with my trainer . ”
70587	70605	70569	70569	his	25	“ You wo n’t ever do them with anyone else , ever again , you hear me ? ”
70606	70609	70610	70610	His	25	“ Why ? ”
70642	70666	70667	70667	He	25	“ Because you look way too fucking sexy like this , and I wo n’t have anyone else seeing my wife this way . ”
70683	70720	70672	70672	his	25	“ No man will be able to sit here , holding you in this position , without wanting a taste of your pussy . You will not do this again , not with anyone but me . ”
70738	70742	70743	70743	Ares	25	“ Or what ? ”
70766	70814	70745	70745	his	25	“ Do you have any idea how easy it is to take advantage of you in this position ? You ’re a supermodel , baby . Your sessions are one - on - one , are n’t they ? Just you and your trainer , all alone … ”
70823	70839	70840	70840	He	25	“ You ca n’t tell me he ’s never wanted to do this to you . ”
70857	70891	70892	70892	His	25	“ No man can see you lying there , your legs up in the air , without thinking of the way you ’d look naked , without wanting a taste of your pussy . ”
70912	70927	70901	70901	he	25	“ Promise me you wo n’t do these stretches with anyone else , Rave . ”
70928	70938	70939	70939	He	25	“ And if I refuse to make that promise ? ”
70951	70961	70939	70939	He	25	“ You wanna play games with me , baby ? ”
70999	71003	71004	71004	he	25	“ Fucking hell , ”
71024	71030	71031	71031	He	25	“ Oh God , Ares … ”
71077	71080	71081	71081	I	0	“ Ares , ”
71094	71104	71084	71084	He	25	“ What ? What do you want , wife ? ”
71118	71125	71126	71126	He	25	“ You know what I want . ”
71178	71230	71168	71168	he	25	“ Tell me what you want , Raven . Tell me what you want me to do . Do you want me to fuck your pussy with my tongue ? My fingers ? Or shall I give you my cock ? Do you want to come for me , my love ? ”
71281	71284	71285	71285	I	0	“ Yes , ”
71312	71317	71318	71318	I	0	“ Ares , no , ”
71345	71359	71335	71335	he	925	“ You want more , baby ? You want to come for me ? ”
71365	71379	71335	71335	he	925	“ Please , Ares . Please . Make me come , my love . ”
71384	71419	71420	71420	He	925	“ I ’ll reward you for calling me my love , but you do n’t get to come unless you swear to me that no other man will ever help you with your stretches . ”

71547	71567	71568	71568	He	925	“ I swear , Ares . You ’re the only man who will ever help me with my stretches . ”
71624	71629	71610	71610	he	925	“ I ca n’t … ”
71698	71703	71704	71704	he	925	“ Look at you , ”
71707	71738	71704	71704	he	925	“ Ripped yoga pants , a wet pussy , and that satisfied fucking smile on your face . You look like you ’re my own personal little slut , baby . ”

71853	71870	71871	71871	He	25	“ Do you have any idea how many times I ’ve dreamed of this , Raven ? ”
71889	71893	71894	71894	I	0	“ Go slow , ”
71897	71907	71894	71894	I	0	“ It just … it ’s been so long . ”

72026	72029	72030	72030	Ares	25	“ Fuck ! ”
72107	72127	72128	72128	He	46	“ Ares ! There ’s been a change to today ’s schedule , and I could n’t reach you . ”
72144	72148	72149	72149	he	46	“ Mrs. Windsor , ”
72163	72166	72149	72149	he	46	“ Dom . ”
72172	72178	72179	72179	Ares	25	“ Get out , Dom , ”
72215	72225	72205	72205	Ares	25	“ I … I need to go , Cupcake . ”
72233	72236	72226	72226	I	0	“ Go . ”

72265	72273	72256	72256	I	0	“ I ’ll hold you to it . ”
72288	72313	72314	72314	I	0	“ Do n’t forget to meet me at the jeweler ’s later . Our appointment is today . I ’ll text you the address . ”

72666	72676	72677	72678	Mr. Laurier	73	“ Please follow me , Mr. and Mrs. Windsor . ”
72696	72704	72686	72686	he	73	“ Do you have anything in mind ? ”
72738	72764	72729	72729	he	25	“ Anything you want , Raven . There is no budget . I just want you to have a ring you ’ll wear with pride . ”
72772	72791	72765	72765	He	25	“ My only request is that you engrave my name on the inside of my wife ’s ring . ”
72830	72835	72836	72836	I	0	“ I drew something , ”
72839	72854	72836	72836	I	0	“ But I ’m not sure if it ’d be possible to create this . ”
72866	72900	72859	72859	he	73	“ We can definitely make this , Mrs. Windsor . It ’ll be a shared - prong eternity band with a trellis design . What kind of carat weight were you thinking of ? ”
72915	72927	72928	72928	he	25	“ I need it to be visible from across the room , ”
72935	72945	72928	72928	he	25	“ Would ten carats be okay ? Perhaps fifteen . ”
72956	72967	72951	72951	I	0	“ Are you insane ? That ’s far too much . ”
72977	72993	72974	72974	his	25	“ You ’re a Windsor . You ’re my wife . Nothing is too much . ”
73001	73060	72994	72995	Mr. Laurier	73	“ Because this is an eternity ring , there will be several diamonds on your ring with a combined total weight of ten carats . I will ensure that the end result looks classy , Mrs. Windsor . I understand your worries , but please rest assured . The final result will be breathtaking and befitting your stature . ”
73121	73126	73127	73127	Ares	25	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
73183	73195	73178	73178	Hannah	26	“ Can I pick a new ring for you , too ? ”
73307	73311	73312	73312	he	25	“ Of course , ”
73316	73323	73312	73312	he	25	“ Choose whatever you ’d like . ”
73345	73367	73368	73368	He	25	“ I want a plain , wide yellow gold band for Ares , with a very subtle feather engraving all over . ”
73375	73384	73368	73368	He	25	“ A raven ’s feather , I assume ? ”
73407	73412	73395	73395	he	25	“ I like it . ”
73420	73444	73413	73413	He	25	“ I want my rings within two weeks , and I only want the very best stones you can find for my wife . ”
73504	73519	73494	73494	he	25	“ Certainly , Mr. Windsor . I will personally deliver them to your home . ”
73545	73551	73552	73552	he	25	“ Let ’s go home , ”
73582	73586	73587	73587	Ares	25	“ You okay ? ”
73719	73722	73723	73723	Ares	25	“ Raven , ”
73813	73829	73805	73805	he	25	“ You ’ve been quiet since we walked out , baby . What ’s wrong ? ”
73842	73851	73852	73852	I	0	“ Moment of honesty ? I feel guilty , ”
73856	73914	73852	73852	I	0	“ I ’m scared of feeling even a single moment of happiness with you because I ca n’t help but fear that it ’ll all be ripped away from me . Sometimes , I feel like I ’m on borrowed time , and though I try to fight that feeling , I ca n’t always escape it . ”
73923	73971	73915	73915	I	0	“ I just want what any other woman would want , Ares . I want a happy marriage of my own . I do n’t want to deprive myself of anything I desire , yet I ca n’t take what I want without hurting others , without — ”
74083	74268	74065	74065	He	25	“ Fuck everyone else , Raven . You ’re my wife . It ’s my honor and duty to make sure all your needs are met , whatever they might be — I do n’t care if it ’s the interior of our home , our wedding rings , or the way we interact with each other . If you want it to change , it ’ll change . We did n’t start off right , but allow me to make amends , baby . This is new to me too , but I do n’t do things halfheartedly . I ’m a Windsor , Raven , and you know as well as I do that marriage means something in the Windsor family . The moment I married you , I became yours . Maybe my heart is n’t quite there yet , and maybe it never will be , but everything else is yours . Only yours . So take what you want . Ask for anything you want . If it ’s within my power , I ’ll give it to you . ”
74269	74299	74300	74300	He	948	“ Even if what I ’m asking for is your body ? Your devotion ? Passion ? What if what I want is everything that used to be hers ? ”
74314	74319	74320	74320	he	948	“ I ’m yours , ”
74323	74339	74320	74320	he	948	“ And there ’s nothing I ’d rather do than make you mine in return . ”
74680	74683	74684	74684	I	0	“ Ares , ”
74703	74825	74826	74826	He	954	“ I have a tendency to overthink things , so communication is really important to me . I ’ll drive myself crazy if I keep trying to guess how you feel about me . The last time I made a move , you rejected me and told me you ’d never want me , and it ’s left my heart bruised and my confidence shaken . Things have changed between us since then , but I need to know that I ’m not just an obligation to you . So I ’m going to ask you a question , just once . If your answer is no , I ’ll go to bed and we ’ll both pretend nothing ever happened . ”
74837	74855	74856	74856	He	954	“ Do you truly want me ? If we were n’t married , would you want me ? ”
74967	74987	74988	74988	His	954	“ Is that enough of an answer , Raven ? I want you so fucking badly that it hurts . ”
74999	75024	74988	74988	His	954	“ I ’ve dreamed of your pussy far more often than I ’d dare admit , for far longer than I ever should have . ”
75051	75077	75080	75080	his	954	“ You feel that , baby ? Can you feel how hard you make me ? You drive me fucking crazy . You always have . ”
75099	75102	75103	75103	he	954	“ Open , ”
75214	75217	75218	75218	he	954	“ Fuck , ”
75224	75291	75218	75218	he	954	“ You have no idea how long I ’ve wanted to do this . I have n’t stopped thinking about that massage I gave you . Baby , I ’ve wanted to slip my hands underneath your nightgown for longer than you can imagine . You knew exactly what you were doing to me when you wore that sexy sleepwear for me , did n’t you ? ”
75299	75318	75319	75319	He	958	“ I was trying to seduce you , but I guess I ’m not very good at it . ”
75333	75427	75428	75428	He	958	“ You ’re far better at it than I let on , Cupcake . I ’m practically always hard around you . You ’re not the only one that overthinks things , Rave . You ’re the most important woman in my life , and there ’s no way I was going to do anything that would upset you . I ’d already asked enough of you by making you marry me , and I did n’t dare ask for anything else … but that does n’t mean I did n’t want it . ”
75438	75453	75454	75454	Ares	25	“ Let me show you what it means to be my wife , Raven . ”
75475	75492	75468	75468	he	958	“ You have no idea how many times I ’ve dreamed of your lips , baby . ”
75493	75496	75497	75497	I	0	“ Ares , ”
75506	75509	75497	75497	I	0	“ Please . ”
75523	75530	75531	75531	My	0	“ Tell me what you want . ”
75548	75559	75560	75560	I	0	“ I want you to make my fantasies come true , ”
75563	75571	75560	75560	I	0	“ I want you desperate for me . ”
75582	75595	75575	75575	I	0	“ I ’m not sure how much more desperate I can get . ”
75635	75638	75639	75639	he	958	“ Raven , ”
75684	75703	75704	75704	Ares	25	“ Fuck . When you do wear panties , you wear some really fucking sexy shit , baby . ”
75739	75743	75744	75744	he	958	“ My love , ”
75747	75793	75744	75744	he	958	“ I want to find out what you look like with my name on your lips and my cock buried deep inside you . Do you know how it killed me to have to pull out when I ’d only just gotten the tip in ? ”
75806	75812	75813	75813	I	0	“ Then stop teasing me , ”
75827	75853	75822	75822	he	958	“ You have no idea how long I ’ve wanted you naked in my bed . Each night with you has been torture , baby . ”
75866	75899	75854	75854	He	958	“ Do you have any idea how many times I ’ve replayed that night you sat in my lap ? Fuck . It took all of me not to touch you then . ”
75919	75926	75927	75927	I	0	“ I want you naked too , ”
75931	75965	75927	75927	I	0	“ Do you remember that night you told me to take off your pajamas ? I was so tempted to take off more than just that , but I did n’t dare to . ”
75978	75984	75966	75966	He	958	“ Undress me , baby . ”
76008	76012	76013	76013	he	958	“ My turn , ”
76052	76055	76056	76056	he	958	“ Fuck , ”

76073	76084	76085	76085	He	958	“ Nor can I , husband . So come here . ”
76094	76099	76100	76100	he	958	“ Say that again , ”

77609	77645	77606	77606	her	22	“ Hell no . I did n’t ask you for details . I just wanted to know whether you ’d done it yet or not . What should we call this ? Operation Honey Trap ? ”

78040	78044	78045	78045	Grandma	44	“ Come on , ”
78065	78108	78057	78057	she	44	“ I suppose it ’s too early to give you yours , Sierra , but I know what you ’re like , and I did n’t want you to harass Raven about hers , so you get yours early . Open it . ”
78149	78190	78191	78191	She	985	“ You , my sweet Raven , will inherit all of the Windsor jewelry . You ’ll become this family ’s next matriarch , and there ’s no one else I ’d rather have at the head of this family . ”
78197	78216	78191	78191	She	985	“ And you will , no doubt , become the matriarch of the family you ’ll marry into . ”
78220	78234	78217	78217	Sierra	22	“ Want to give me a clue about who you chose for me ? ”

78290	78309	78287	78287	Grandma	44	“ And I do n’t think I am either . Do you want to leave Grandma so soon ? ”

78382	78385	78386	78386	Sierra	22	“ Oh , ”
78389	78400	78386	78386	Sierra	22	“ I ’d say it ’s treating her real well . ”
78425	78438	78439	78439	She	44	“ It ’s been good . Thank you for asking , Grandma . ”
78442	78588	78439	78439	She	44	“ You two got one month of no interruptions or family obligations , but your time is up now . You must make a formal announcement , which will result in increased media attention for you . Considering your job , I think you ’re uniquely equipped to handle that . With it , will also come formal engagements . There will be many events you must attend as a Windsor , even if it ’s just to make a quick appearance . I know how hard you work , Raven , but your schedule is about to become even busier . I will not even allow you to miss our weekly family dinners going forward , much less anything else . The family ’s reputation is important , and many of our businesses have thrived because of our network . We must maintain that . ”
78589	78595	78596	78596	I	0	“ I know , Grandma , ”
78600	78628	78629	78629	Grandma	44	“ I ’ll be fine , I promise . I ’ve attended so many charity events with you that I ’m not at all concerned about it . ”

78675	78686	78687	78687	she	44	“ Wear that to the next formal event you attend , ”
78696	78709	78687	78687	she	44	“ It ’ll send a strong message to anyone that knows us . ”

79313	79328	79329	79329	She	24	“ It ’s unfortunate that you ’re hiding my favorite parts of your body . ”
79348	79387	79335	79335	I	0	“ Your favorite parts , huh ? If my cock is n’t your favorite part of my body , then I ’m not doing my job properly . I promise you that I ’m about to remedy that . ”
79433	79444	79445	79445	I	0	“ Allow me to make you another promise , Raven . ”
79471	79597	79465	79465	I	0	“ You and I started our marriage under the worst possible circumstances , and even now , it feels like so much stands between us , like the odds are stacked against us . I do n’t know what our future will hold , Rave , but this much I promise you : throughout our entire marriage , you will be everything to me . I will prioritize you above all else , and I ’ll do everything in my power to ensure you ’ll never feel like you ’ve had to sacrifice anything to marry me . I know the road we ’ve chosen to walk is n’t an easy one , but I ca n’t think of a better partner on this journey . ”
79679	79697	79698	79698	She	24	“ Do you want to put that on me , or should I put it on myself ? ”
79722	79725	79726	79726	she	24	“ Ares , ”
79733	79840	79726	79726	she	24	“ You were never supposed to be mine , but now that you are , I promise to give this marriage my all . It ’s been odd for both of us , and I know we ’re still adjusting to being together . You ’re right to say that so much is still uncertain , but this much I promise you : for the rest of our lives , I ’ll be true to you in every way . You ’ll be everything to me , and I ’ll do everything within my power to be the best wife you ever could ’ve asked for . ”
79880	79887	79888	79888	she	1004	“ Are we really doing this ? ”
79900	79931	79891	79891	I	0	“ We already did , Rave . We ’ve been married for a month now . It ’s about time we face the facts and work toward a future together . ”
79932	79984	79985	79985	I	0	“ Do you truly see a future with me , Ares ? When we first got married you … well , you mentioned leaving me in three years . Do you still want to ? I need to know . I ca n’t … I do n’t want to get hurt . ”
80002	80053	79985	79985	I	0	“ I will never let you go , Raven . Fuck what I said . I was a fucking moron who did n’t realize that he ’d struck fucking gold . You ’re my wife , for better or worse . Only you . For as long as I live . ”
80066	80098	80054	80054	She	1004	“ Promise me . You told me you never break a promise , so promise me that you ’ll be mine for the rest of our lives . No matter what . ”
80109	80122	80099	80099	I	0	“ I ’m yours , Raven Windsor . Forever . I promise . ”

80516	80523	80524	80524	John	57	“ What the fuck is this ? ”
80545	80582	80533	80533	his	57	“ You fucking got married ? Married ? To Ares Windsor ? You got married to the biggest media mogul in the country and you did n’t even tell me ? What the fuck , Rave ? ”
80632	80635	80636	80636	John	57	“ Surprise ? ”
80666	80671	80672	80672	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
80676	80689	80672	80672	I	0	“ It ’s not that I did n’t want to invite you , ”
80694	80740	80741	80741	He	57	“ It ’s just that the guest list was kept incredibly small . Our families are old friends , and well , my mother curated the guest list on my behalf . I ’ve been so busy with work that I … I ’m sorry . ”
80749	80754	80746	80746	his	57	“ I get it . ”
80783	80818	80771	80771	I	0	“ But I did n’t even know you were dating him , Raven . How did that happen ? How and why did you hide a relationship with Ares Windsor , of all people ? ”
80877	80880	80881	80881	he	25	“ Raven , ”
80945	80953	80954	80954	he	25	“ I love the photo you posted , ”
80957	80982	80954	80954	he	25	“ I thought you ’d pick a general photo of us , or perhaps something from recent years , but there was no ambiguity . ”
81001	81010	81011	81011	I	0	“ I ’m proud to be your wife , ”
81014	81025	81011	81011	I	0	“ Why would n’t I want to show you off ? ”
81037	81043	81044	81044	he	25	“ You made my day , ”
81047	81056	81044	81044	he	25	“ I ’ll have to reward you later . ”
81133	81156	81125	81125	he	25	“ I ’ve seen you around , but we ’ve never formally met . I ’m Ares Windsor , Raven ’s husband . ”
81200	81208	81209	81209	he	25	“ I ’m also your new boss , ”
81218	81235	81209	81209	he	25	“ Since this agency is such a good fit for my organisation , I bought it . ”
81244	81248	81236	81236	I	0	“ You what ? ”
81255	81293	81249	81249	Ares	25	“ I thought it would be good for us to own the company you work for . You can have it , if you want . I ’ll sign it over to you , on two conditions . ”
81294	81298	81299	81299	He	25	“ What conditions ? ”
81309	81327	81299	81299	He	25	“ No more campaigns with other men , and you ’re no longer allowed to overwork yourself . ”
81340	81358	81328	81328	I	0	“ Did you buy my entire modeling agency because you do n’t like me shooting with men ? ”
81364	81421	81361	81361	his	25	“ So what if I did ? I ’m your husband . The only hands allowed on your body are mine . I could n’t ask you to breach any of your existing contracts , so I bought the company and canceled every single contract that required you to be even remotely intimate with another man . ”
81422	81440	81441	81441	He	25	“ The penalty to terminate any of my contracts is millions , Ares . Are you insane ? ”
81449	81492	81441	81441	He	25	“ My love , I do n’t think you quite realize that your wedding ring is worth more than the penalty I paid . And either way , it does n’t matter . There ’s nothing I wo n’t do for you . ”
81511	81515	81516	81516	he	25	“ Mr. Windsor , ”
81523	81542	81516	81516	he	25	“ Raven has a shoot in a couple of minutes . We ’ll need to head out now . ”
81554	81565	81566	81566	He	25	“ It ’s canceled . I ’m taking her home . ”
81574	81586	81566	81566	He	25	“ The media have already swarmed this building , my love . ”
81597	81633	81634	81634	He	25	“ They ’re going to get us home safely . Once we get through the gates of the Windsor estate , we ’ll be in the clear . Until then , we ’ll need them . ”
81640	81708	81634	81634	He	25	“ The next couple of weeks are going to be tough as the media tries to find out as much as they can about us . We ’ll both be forced into the spotlight in a way we never have been before . Windsor Media is monitoring all news coverage about us , and I ’ve got my legal team ready to jump in if need be . ”
81716	81730	81731	81731	I	0	“ Do n’t worry . I ’m used to dealing with the press , ”
82006	82009	82010	82010	I	0	“ Ares , ”
82023	82029	82010	82010	I	0	“ Do n’t get dressed . ”
82052	82077	82041	82041	I	0	“ I want to measure you . I ’ve got something in mind that I want to design for our first official event together . ”
82090	82100	82080	82080	his	25	“ You want to measure me … right now ? ”
82104	82126	82080	82080	his	25	“ Yeah . I prefer to get accurate measurements . It ’s not quite the same over clothes , you know ? ”
82127	82130	82131	82131	He	25	“ Fine . ”
82207	82212	82213	82213	I	0	“ Lift your arms , ”
82313	82321	82322	82322	He	25	“ Do you have any favorite colors ? ”
82346	82360	82361	82361	I	0	“ Whatever you create for me will be amazing , I ’m sure . ”
82401	82409	82410	82410	I	0	“ Oh , I forgot your neck . ”
82480	82490	82491	82491	he	25	“ This is how you take measurements , wife ? ”
82511	82527	82508	82508	my	0	“ No . I never do this myself , but I wanted to for you . ”
82528	82531	82532	82532	he	25	“ Hmm , ”
82535	82546	82532	82532	he	25	“ Very well . No one but me , Raven . ”
82599	82606	82607	82607	he	25	“ What are you measuring next ? ”
82623	82626	82627	82627	I	0	“ Thighs , ”
82718	82721	82722	82722	he	25	“ Raven , ”
82730	82735	82725	82725	I	0	“ Is something wrong ? ”
82824	82832	82811	82811	his	25	“ What are you doing , wife ? ”
82840	82844	82833	82833	I	0	“ Measuring you ? ”
82845	82853	82854	82854	I	0	“ Is that all you ’re doing ? ”
82912	82924	82925	82925	His	25	“ Is there something else you ’d rather make me do ? ”
82941	82962	82963	82963	he	25	“ If I find out you ’ve ever measured another man this way , there ’ll be hell to pay , ”
83013	83016	83017	83017	he	25	“ Raven , ”
83103	83108	83109	83109	he	25	“ Look at you , ”
83112	83164	83165	83165	He	25	“ Look at you taking my cock , baby . You ’re such a perfect little slut for me . The whole world thinks you ’re this sweet and innocent woman . What would they think if they knew how much you ’re loving the way I ’m fucking your face ? ”
83179	83193	83194	83194	he	25	“ Slide your hand down your body , right down to your pussy , ”
83201	83210	83194	83194	he	25	“ Are you wet for me , baby ? ”
83222	83247	83211	83211	I	0	“ Finger yourself for me , Raven . I want to see you riding your own hand while I fuck your hot little mouth . ”
83266	83291	83292	83292	I	0	“ Unless you want me to shoot my cum all the way down your throat , I advise you to ease off , Wifey . ”
83320	83334	83335	83335	I	0	“ Fuck , Raven . Baby , your mouth is too fucking good . ”
83402	83405	83409	83409	Hannah	26	“ Ares ! ”
83448	83452	83453	83453	he	25	“ Get dressed , ”
83519	83522	83523	83523	he	25	“ Raven , ”
83534	83538	83539	83539	I	0	“ Just go , ”
83542	83552	83539	83539	I	0	“ Go to her , like you always do . ”

83832	83835	83836	83836	I	0	“ Han , ”
83839	83854	83836	83836	I	0	“ Do n’t cry , please . It was our wedding day , Hannah . ”
83855	83858	83859	83859	she	26	“ Why ? ”
83866	83906	83862	83862	her	26	“ Why did you have to make everything between you look so real ? Why ca n’t you just tell everyone that it ’s just a marriage of convenience ? That it ’s nothing more than a business arrangement ? ”
83920	83939	83907	83907	I	0	“ You know as well as I do that Grandma insists we give our marriage a real chance . ”
83940	83943	83944	83944	she	26	“ Ares , ”
83947	83974	83944	83944	she	26	“ Please do n’t tell me you ’re really giving your marriage with her a chance ? You two are n’t … you ca n’t be … ”
84023	84055	84021	84021	Hannah	26	“ If you do this , you and I can never get back together . Ares , please . Please do n’t do anything we ca n’t recover from . Please . ”
84107	84157	84158	84158	Her	26	“ Hannah … she ’s my wife . You knew exactly what you were doing when you left me at the altar . You walked out on us , so you have no right to tell me what I can or can not do with the woman I married . ”
84171	84179	84180	84180	she	26	“ Are you sleeping with my sister ? ”
84189	84220	84180	84180	she	26	“ Are the two of you going behind my back ? I always thought you were weirdly close , but I trusted you . Did you want her all along ? ”
84269	84320	84262	84262	Hannah	26	“ That is , quite frankly , no longer any of your business . You and I ca n’t be more than friends , and you ca n’t do this . You ca n’t drop by my house unannounced and get upset about my wife and me simply being together . ”
84321	84328	84329	84329	she	26	“ Stop calling her your wife ! ”
84332	84341	84329	84329	she	26	“ That ’s what she is , Hannah ! ”
84377	84380	84381	84381	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
84397	84440	84381	84381	I	0	“ Han , please … I ’m sorry . I just … I ’m fucking exhausted too , you know ? I feel like I ’m fucking trapped , and no matter what I do , I ’ll be letting someone down . ”
84441	84444	84445	84445	I	0	“ Here . ”
84519	84524	84525	84525	she	24	“ How could you ! ”
84528	84563	84525	84525	she	24	“ How could you post something like that , Raven ? You did that on purpose , you fucking bitch . You ’re trying to come between Ares and me , are n’t you ? ”
84574	84587	84564	84564	Raven	24	“ I ’m trying to come between you and … my husband ? ”
84592	84678	84564	84564	Raven	24	“ Do n’t think I never noticed the way you always looked at him , Raven . The only reason I never said anything was because I knew he ’d never want you — not when he could have me . You know that just as well . Call him your husband all you want , but he ’ll never truly be yours . Hell , you could fuck him and it ’d still be me he ’d love . It ’ll always be me . ”
84679	84682	84683	84683	I	0	“ Hannah ! ”
84703	84723	84696	84696	She	24	“ It ’s true . Can you deny it , Ares ? Tell me you no longer love me . ”
84724	84730	84731	84731	Her	24	“ You need to leave . ”
84737	84740	84731	84731	Her	24	“ What ? ”
84741	84802	84843	84843	she	24	“ Do n’t make me repeat myself . I warned you to respect my marriage , Hannah . After everything you ’ve put us through , that ’s all I ’ve asked of you . You ’re forgetting that it ’s Raven who paid the price for your choices . She deserves better than this — from both of us . ”
84817	84821	84810	84810	she	24	“ I just … ”
84822	84828	84829	84829	I	0	“ You need to leave , ”
84859	84915	84846	84846	Raven	24	“ Rave , I ’m sorry . You know what I ’m like , right ? I let my emotions get the best of me , and I was jealous . I know you two would n’t do that to me , but I just could n’t see clearly . I ’m sorry , Rave . ”
84964	84967	84968	84968	I	0	“ Raven , ”
84971	85021	84968	84968	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . She should n’t have said all that . I think she ’s just been having a hard time with everything that ’s going on . You know her heart is in the right place , right ? She ’s just hurting and lashing out . ”
85089	85093	85094	85094	she	24	“ Do n’t , ”
85101	85147	85094	85094	she	24	“ Do n’t defend her like that , Ares . It kills me when you do that , ca n’t you see ? You keep promising me that you ’ll give me your all , yet you run out at the sound of her voice . ”
85160	85254	85148	85148	She	24	“ And then you just stand there when she ’s telling me that you ’ll never be mine — not a single word of denial . How am I supposed to believe your words when your actions say otherwise ? It is n’t her I ’m concerned about . It ’s you . You ’re making me feel like a part of you truly does still love her , and I ca n’t stand it . The way you acted just now made me feel like you do n’t truly care about me . ”
85287	85299	85300	85300	I	0	“ Raven , you know that I do n’t love her . ”
85307	85340	85300	85300	I	0	“ And of course I care about you . You meant the world to me before we even got married , Raven . You ’ve always been one of my closest friends . ”
85352	85370	85341	85341	She	1047	“ Did you see me as a friend when you fucked my face just now , Ares ? ”
85371	85385	85386	85386	She	1047	“ Fuck , Raven . You know that ’s not what I meant . ”
85399	85524	85386	85386	She	1047	“ You said you feel trapped in this marriage , but how do you think I feel ? I was forced to marry someone I ’ll never stand a chance with — someone who will never even be able to look at me without thinking of my sister . Have you ever stopped to think about what I might have wanted out of a marriage ? I want happiness too , Ares . I can see now that you will never give me that , no matter what I do . I ’ll never be her . When given a choice between hurting either of us , it ’s always me you ’ll choose . I ’ll never be your priority , not truly . ”
85587	85595	85596	85596	John	57	“ You have n’t been yourself today , ”
85599	85622	85596	85596	John	57	“ Your facial expressions were off during your shoot this morning . Are you sure you ’re fine to walk this show ? ”
85749	85756	85757	85757	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m fine , ”
85917	85925	85926	85926	John	57	“ You ’re not fine , Raven . ”
85944	86000	85941	85941	his	57	“ Are you overwhelmed with work ? Have I been scheduling too much in for you ? Or is it something else … is it Windsor ? He ’s given us complete control over your schedule with just a few caveats , but you need to tell me if he ’s pressuring you in private . ”
86047	86055	86056	86056	I	0	“ I just did n’t sleep well , ”
86090	86111	86078	86079	The designer	1056	“ Are you okay , Rave ? I ’m worried about you . Did Ares Windsor do something to you ? ”
86123	86155	86156	86156	John	57	“ We had an argument , but that ’s all it was . I suppose that ’s just what marriage is like , right ? It ca n’t always be perfect . ”
86248	86251	86252	86252	he	57	“ Raven , ”
86284	86298	86275	86275	He	57	“ Excuse us , please . I need a moment with my wife . ”

86339	86367	86331	86331	he	57	“ What was that ? Why are you … you ’re half - naked in front of him . Is there something going on between you two ? ”
86407	86412	86413	86413	His	57	“ Does it matter ? ”
86423	86441	86418	86418	he	57	“ Of course it does . We promised each other fidelity when we got married , Raven . ”
86474	86498	86499	86499	He	57	“ I did n’t cheat on you , Ares . I ’d never do that . I ’m not that kind of person . ”
86514	86521	86506	86506	he	57	“ Do you two have history ? ”
86529	86538	86522	86522	I	0	“ Nothing like what you share with Hannah . ”
86552	86555	86556	86556	he	57	“ Rave , ”
86573	86584	86565	86565	Ares	25	“ I ’m sorry about yesterday . I really am . ”
86599	86604	86605	86605	he	57	“ Listen to me , ”
86608	86673	86605	86605	he	57	“ You ’ve been ignoring my calls all day . I ca n’t take this , baby . This is not what I want our marriage to be like , okay ? Did n’t we promise to communicate ? Our situation is already so unconventional … the last thing I want to do is complicate it any further . Listen to me , please . ”
86679	86682	86683	86683	I	0	“ Fine , ”

The situation is tricky , and I feel like I ’m either hurting Hannah or I ’m hurting you . That ’s all I meant . I did n’t for a single second mean that I feel trapped in this marriage with you , you hear me ? I ’ve never been happier , Rave . I just know that hurting Hannah will put additional strain on your relationship with her , too . I do n’t want to be the reason you argue with your sister , baby . I just … I just want you to be happy . ”

I do n’t think I ever told you this , but hearing you say that truly broke my heart . That memory still haunts me , and even though things are different between us now , my heart still aches each time I think of it . Every once in a while , I find myself wondering if that was the truth , and everything we ’ve got is built on a lie . ”

We ’ve been in denial , pretending three years would pass and we could just act like they did n’t happen at all , picking back up where we left off … but that ’s not how this works . It is n’t that simple . You ’re nothing more than my wife ’s sister , Han . You ’ll never be more than that . Not ever again . ”

You knew what the consequences would be , but you were self - centered enough to think you ’d get away with it . Yes , it fucking kills me to watch you fall apart , but do you know what hurts even more ? The fact that you walked away from everything we could ’ve had . The fact that you ’re here in my office now , clinging onto something you forced me to let go of . You did this . You destroyed three lives with your actions , and now you ’re mad that Raven and I managed to build something with the broken pieces ? How is that fair , Han ? How is it fair to me ? To her ? ”

I see the way you keep touching your wedding ring , the moments of absentmindedness as doubts steal your attention away from me . I notice every little thing about you , Raven . I can assure you , my darling wife , you do n’t have a single thing to worry about . ”
92465	92471	92472	92475	one of the reporters	1119	“ Congratulations on your marriage , ”

92515	92596	92503	92503	Ares	25	“ Did we hide it ? Or did you just fail to notice it ? My wife and my sister have been best friends since they were kids , so she ’s been at the Windsor mansion at least once a week for years . She ’s been at every single major Windsor event throughout the years too , and she ’s often been spotted with my grandmother , has n’t she ? You just failed to connect the dots . ”
92614	92647	92603	92603	she	1121	“ That diamond necklace you ’re wearing , Raven . Is n’t that a Windsor heirloom ? It ’s said that it was crafted by the Laurier family hundreds of years ago . ”
92658	92671	92672	92673	The reporter	1121	“ That ’s right . Ares ’s grandmother gave it to me . ”
92676	92702	92672	92673	The reporter	1121	“ It ’s said that seeing a Windsor bride wearing an heirloom piece signifies the matriarch ’s approval . Would you say that ’s true ? ”
92729	92773	92774	92774	She	1121	“ All I have to say is that I ’ve always loved Ares ’s grandmother like she is my own , and I ’m beyond grateful to receive her love in return . We had a great relationship long before I married Ares . ”
92786	92814	92774	92774	She	1121	“ Could you tell us , Mr. Windsor ? What is it about Raven that made you fall for her , other than her obvious good looks ? ”
92848	92938	92835	92835	he	25	“ She ’s the smartest , sweetest , most loyal and most hardworking woman I know . She has never once let me down , and she ’s always been there for me throughout the years , no matter what I asked of her . Raven is n’t just my wife . She ’s everything to me . She might be my sister ’s best friend , but she ’s mine , too . I fell for her heart before I ever fell for any other part of her . ”

93027	93052	93024	93024	he	25	“ What do you think of my wife ’s dress ? She designed it herself . She designed my suit for me , too . ”

93233	93291	93292	93292	Her	26	“ For years , there were rumors about Ares and you , when in truth , he was dating your sister . Was that hard for you ? I know you denied the rumors multiple times , but they never truly went away . Were you ever tempted to spill their secrets and admit they were dating ? ”
93296	93323	93324	93325	The reporter	1121	“ As you know , I rarely discuss my private life . Can I please ask that you keep all questions related to tonight ’s premiere ? ”

I remember what it felt like to see you with her at these type of events , and I do n’t want her to feel that same kind of pain . But simultaneously … I ’m jealous of the way she keeps looking at you , the photos the two of you kept taking , the interviews you just did together . I ’m … I ’m just so jealous , and I hate myself for it . ”

94381	94417	94368	94368	she	26	“ You flew out to meet me on set , and you watched me film this . Afterward , we went to that vineyard that gave us the idea to get married in one ourselves . ”

94495	94525	94489	94489	Hannah	26	“ Do n’t pretend you ca n’t remember . I still recall how impatient you were . We should visit that vineyard again and reenact some of those memories . ”
94572	94578	94579	94579	I	0	“ Have some fucking respect , ”
94583	94600	94601	94601	She	26	“ Need I remind you that I ’m married ? To your sister , no less . ”
94604	94656	94601	94601	She	26	“ It ’s just a title and a piece of paper . I do n’t give a shit , Ares . We both know that the second you and I are alone in a room , you ’ll forget all about the fact that you ’re married . You always do . ”
94710	94713	94714	94714	I	0	“ Leave , ”

94972	95014	94963	94963	her	26	“ You ’ll regret treating me this way , Ares . We ’ve always had our ups and downs , and this is no different . Do n’t go too far , because I promise you , you ’ll regret it . ”
95026	95034	95035	95035	Raven	24	“ You should n’t have done that , ”
95044	95094	95035	95035	Raven	24	“ The last thing we want to do is create a scandal . Next thing we know , all the news outlets are reporting on a family dispute between the three of us . It might not be easy , but we have to take the high road here . ”
95110	95195	95095	95095	I	0	“ You ’re fucking insane if you think I ’m going to sit there and watch you choke back tears . You ’re my wife , Raven . She ’s nothing but your sister to me . I do n’t give a fuck about my past with her , and I do n’t want to hear about it either . I certainly wo n’t fucking sit here and let her hurt you , because we both know that ’s exactly what she was doing . ”
95207	95230	95196	95196	I	0	“ You ’re my wife . You ’re not someone anyone can offend or hurt . Certainly not on my fucking watch . ”

95385	95405	95406	95406	I	0	“ The fact that she managed to hurt you at all makes me feel like I ’ve failed you . ”
95448	95474	95475	95475	I	0	“ Fuck what she said . Fuck the past . I ’m yours , Raven . I will never leave you . No matter what . ”

95564	95583	95558	95558	I	0	“ I love this about you . You always want me just as badly as I want you . ”
95606	95632	95633	95633	She	1157	“ You ’re always so fucking wet for me , baby . Tell me , my love , have you always wanted me this way ? ”
95644	95647	95633	95633	She	1157	“ Always . ”
95699	95706	95707	95707	I	0	“ I love everything about you , ”

96082	96125	96126	96126	She	1157	“ I love the way your lips part slightly when my thumb brushes over your clit , the way you start to pant for me , your eyes silently begging . Making you come is one of my favorite hobbies , baby . ”

96899	96902	96903	96903	I	0	“ Raven ? ”
96991	97010	97011	97011	She	26	“ What can I do for you , Han ? Do you need a dress for an event ? ”
97026	97067	97016	97016	she	26	“ Why are you acting like I only ever come to you when I need something ? There ’s no one here , Raven . You do n’t need to pretend to be the good girl , the aggrieved sibling . ”
97081	97088	97089	97089	She	26	“ I ’m sorry , what ? ”
97094	97118	97091	97091	her	26	“ Is that why you fucked my fiancee ? Because you wanted revenge for the way I ’ve treated you over the years ? ”
97119	97124	97125	97125	I	0	“ I … I … ”
97140	97224	97125	97125	I	0	“ Why did you show up at all , Raven ? Why did you show up on my wedding day ? You know as well as I do that Grandma Anne never would ’ve let your company fail , not even if Mom and Dad took away your funding . You never had anything to lose . If you ’d just stayed away , they ’d have had no choice but to reschedule the wedding . Why did you do this to me ? ”
97277	97390	97391	97391	She	1180	“ You know as well as I do that Ares values duty and loyalty above everything else . Do you think he ’s suddenly in love with you ? So quickly ? After the years he spent with me ? Or do you think he ’s making the best of a tough situation and getting laid while he ’s at it ? You ’re his wife now , so he feels he needs to make you happy , no matter what that means for his own happiness . He ’ll pretend till the very bitter end if it makes his family happy — which , in his mind , now includes you . ”
97394	97490	97391	97391	She	1180	“ Do you know why we grew apart , Raven ? It ’s because I ’ve always seen the way you looked at Ares . What kind of woman would lust after her sister ’s fiance the way you did ? It always disgusted me . Did you know Ares and I used to joke about your little crush on him ? He used to think it was childish , but cute . He never once even saw you as a woman . But let me guess … you wore him down by seducing him ? ”
97519	97522	97523	97523	I	0	“ Hannah , ”
97530	97549	97523	97523	I	0	“ What do you want ? What does it all matter ? I ’m married to Ares now . ”
97604	97609	97610	97610	she	1183	“ Not for long , ”
97614	97760	97610	97610	she	1183	“ You might be the one he ’s married to now , but once his duty to you is over , he ’ll come straight back to me . I will always be the one he truly wants , the one he wishes walked down that aisle . And you , my darling sister ? You ’ll always be my replacement , the one he was forced to settle for . You chased after him knowing exactly what kind of damage you ’d cause , but you failed to account for the damage it ’ll cause you in the end . No matter what you do , you will never be me , Raven . Not only will you eventually lose Ares … you lost me , too . I hope your marriage to him is worth it , because it ’ll cost you everything . ”
97775	97783	97784	97784	She	1185	“ Where did you get that ring ? ”
97787	97818	97784	97784	She	1185	“ Like I said … I will always be the one he wants . He ’ll never let you have anything that ’s mine . Not for long , anyway . ”
97819	97826	97827	97827	She	1185	“ Ares gave it to you ? ”
97830	97993	97994	97994	She	1186	“ He did . I told him I wanted my ring back , so he said he ’d get you a new one . We spent so much time picking our rings out together … I ca n’t imagine how hard it must ’ve been for him to see it on your finger . I did n’t think he ’d give it to me so easily , you know ? I thought he ’d be angry and spiteful , but he ’s just the same Ares I ’ve always known and loved . He ’d never deny me anything , even if he has to take it away from his supposed wife . But then again … you already know that , do n’t you ? You know better than anyone else that he loves me with all he ’s got . After a love like that , how much could possibly be left ? How could anyone else ever measure up ? ”
98006	98067	97994	97994	She	1186	“ I will never forgive you for what you did , Raven . You might think things are going well with Ares , and that you made the right choice in doing what you did … but mark my words . You ’ll regret marrying him one day , and he will come back to me . He always does . ”
98261	98264	98265	98265	Ares	25	“ Raven ? ”
98276	98294	98265	98265	Ares	25	“ You ’re home late today . I ’ve been calling you . Where have you been ? ”
98304	98316	98317	98317	I	0	“ I ’ve just been working late , that ’s all . ”
98320	98335	98336	98336	He	25	“ I ’ve got a headache , Ares . I ’m heading to bed . ”
98506	98551	98484	98484	his	25	“ You ’re breaking my heart , Cupcake . I ’m immune to everyone ’s tears but yours . You ’ve got me ready to fall to my knees and beg you to tell me what I can do to make it all better . ”
98685	98688	98689	98689	he	25	“ Raven , ”
98736	98744	98745	98745	He	25	“ Hannah came to my office today . ”
98756	98772	98745	98745	He	25	“ Ares … did you … d - did you give her my wedding ring ? ”
98784	98787	98788	98788	he	25	“ Baby , ”
98791	98864	98788	98788	he	25	“ I swear to you that it ’s nothing like what you might be thinking . She asked for it , and I gave it to her because I did n’t want it to continuously remind you of her . And to be honest , Rave , I did n’t want to hang onto something like that . I sent her mine too . I have no need for either of them . ”
98889	98894	98895	98895	I	0	“ It kills me , ”
98921	98972	98973	98973	He	25	“ The guilt , the pain . It ’s all too much , Ares . Did I make the wrong decision ? Does a small part of you despise me for walking down that aisle instead of staying away ? Do you resent me for standing between Hannah and you ? ”
98993	98997	98998	98998	I	0	“ Do n’t , ”
99001	99102	98998	98998	I	0	“ I do n’t have the courage to listen to your answers , Ares . I ’d rather let my fears eat me alive than hear you confirm Hannah ’s insinuations . I do n’t think I can survive hearing you say that a small part of you still loves her . I ’m scared that you ’ll pity me and you ’ll tell me everything I want to hear without meaning a single word . I ’m scared that everything between us truly is just a duty for you . I wo n’t survive you discarding me for her . ”
99139	99159	99121	99121	Ares	25	“ Are you done speaking , my love ? I fucking hope so , because it ’s my turn . ”
99176	99451	99165	99165	he	25	“ You , Raven Windsor , are the single most unexpected yet best thing that has ever happened to me . I was n’t truly living before you . You drive me fucking insane in the very best way . You make me laugh every single day , and you , my beautiful wife , make me feel things I ’ve never felt before . I thought I knew what love was , you know ? I thought it meant compromise , selflessness and patience . Now I know better . True love is maddening , all - consuming , and it ’s fucking selfish , Rave . It ’s impatience and counting down the minutes until you get home . It ’s being petty about all the men sliding into your DMs and it ’s fucking you raw on our brand - new sofa because I need you with an intensity that extends beyond the physical . It ’s decorating our home together and actually caring about the details , because I want our home to be ours . It ’s arguing with you when I normally would ’ve let things go , simply because when it ’s you , I actually care about every single little fucking thing . That , Mrs. Windsor , is love . Or at least , I think it is , because how else would you define the way I feel ? You ’re everything I did n’t realize I needed , and now that I ’ve had you , I ca n’t go back to a life before you . Not ever . No matter what . ”
99462	99465	99466	99466	he	1195	“ Yeah , ”
99469	99590	99466	99466	he	1195	“ I did n’t see it coming either , but here we are , baby . You and me . It ’s just you and me in this marriage , Raven . There ’s no space for anyone else , so stop letting her in . I know it hurts , and I know you love her . It is n’t easy to figure out how to keep her in our lives when each time we see her , we ’re confronted with a past we both wish did n’t exist . I feel the same guilt you ’re feeling , but it is n’t ours to carry . You and I have done nothing wrong , you hear me ? ”
100608	100612	100613	100613	I	0	“ Hey baby , ”
100635	100641	100642	100642	I	0	“ What are you making ? ”
100704	100720	100700	100700	she	24	“ I ’m baking some bread . I ’m making enough for both of us . ”
100736	100755	100756	100756	She	24	“ Are you putting me on a diet , wife ? Are n’t you satisfied with my abs ? ”
100771	100788	100761	100761	her	24	“ I ’m not sure . How about you take off that shirt and show me ? ”
100799	100807	100761	100761	her	24	“ You do n’t think I will ? ”
100808	100829	100830	100830	My	0	“ Do you dare to ? I ’m constantly surrounded by sexy male models . Can you compete with them ? ”
100848	100855	100843	100843	I	0	“ You tell me , Rave . ”
100879	100884	100885	100885	She	281	“ Can I compete ? ”
100945	100948	100949	100949	she	281	“ Yeah , ”
100956	100961	100949	100949	she	281	“ You ’ll do . ”
100985	101012	100965	100965	I	0	“ I ’ll do , huh ? That does n’t sound so convincing . How about I show you the rest of my body , too ? ”
101013	101038	101046	101046	she	281	“ I think that sounds like a great idea . It ’ll allow me to truly assess your body and all , you know ? ”
101071	101074	101075	101075	she	281	“ Ares , ”
101078	101097	101075	101075	she	281	“ Did you mean it ? When you told me you loved me … did you mean it ? ”
101129	101214	101215	101215	She	281	“ Every single word , Raven . Maybe it ’s too soon , too quick . Or maybe … maybe we ’ve been in the making for years , but neither of us had the courage to admit it to ourselves . I barely dare say the words , but it ’s true . I ’m in love with you , Raven Windsor . Hell , if I ’m truly honest with myself , I fell for you long before you said I do . ”
101232	101235	101236	101236	she	281	“ Ares , ”
101239	101244	101236	101236	she	281	“ I love you . ”

101352	101376	101377	101377	She	281	“ And I , baby , love everything you are , right down to your beautiful soul . I love you , Raven . ”
101424	101441	101442	101442	Sierra	22	“ It ’s been a while since Grandma called us all together like that so urgently , ”
101453	101468	101442	101442	Sierra	22	“ The last time she did that it was to announce your upcoming wedding . ”
101469	101481	101482	101482	Sierra	22	“ Do you have any idea what it might be about ? ”
101487	101504	101484	101484	her	22	“ No clue . I asked my brothers as well , and they have no idea . ”
101543	101548	101549	101549	Sierra	22	“ Who is that ? ”
101607	101610	101602	101602	she	166	“ Mom ? ”
101611	101626	101583	101583	She	166	“ Raven , sweetheart . I ’ve been trying to reach you for hours . ”
101644	101651	101635	101635	I	0	“ What is it , Mom ? ”
101684	101712	101678	101678	She	166	“ I heard Hannah and you had an argument ? She ’s been incredibly upset and told me that you and Ares … that you ’re together ? ”
101726	101792	101713	101713	I	0	“ Is that so ? I assume you told her to accept the fact that she chose to walk away from him ? Did you remind her that I ’m married to Ares ? What exactly is so surprising about be being with my own husband ? Surely she is n’t thinking anything immoral . You raised her better than that , did n’t you ? ”
101831	101858	101859	101859	I	0	“ Ares and you are coming home for your father ’s 60th birthday , are n’t you ? Will you be spending the weekend with us ? ”
101932	101935	101936	101936	I	0	“ Yes , ”
101966	102006	101938	101938	her	1232	“ Please be on your best behavior . Try not to aggravate your sister , okay ? She ’s been having a hard time lately , and it ’s taken a toll on her health . I ’m worried . ”
102023	102026	102027	102027	I	0	“ Sure , ”
102030	102069	102027	102027	I	0	“ I hope you told her the same thing , Mom . I wo n’t provoke her , but do n’t expect me to tolerate her toxic behavior for even a single second , because I wo n’t . ”
102070	102073	102074	102074	Mom	32	“ Toxic ? ”
102079	102087	102088	102088	I	0	“ Do n’t even bother denying it , ”
102092	102128	102088	102088	I	0	“ I neither have the time nor the patience to deal with any of the excuses you ’ll make for her . I ’ll be there this weekend , and I ’ll bring my husband . ”
102129	102132	102074	102074	Mom	32	“ Raven ! ”
102133	102148	102149	102149	I	0	“ I need to go , Mom . I ’ll speak to you later . ”

102234	102299	102231	102231	her	22	“ You ’re made of steel , yet you were always so malleable around your family . They got too used to you bending backwards to keep the peace , but it ’s time you put yourself first . You ’re not alone anymore , Rave . You never were , but you ’re officially a Windsor now . We ’re your family now . ”
102305	102312	102313	102313	She	22	“ I hear you , babe . ”
102316	102334	102313	102313	She	22	“ I know you do , but I ’ll repeat myself until you take it to heart . ”
102378	102385	102386	102386	he	25	“ Let go of my wife , ”
102398	102423	102393	102393	Sierra	22	“ She was mine before she was ever yours . You wanna fight me , bro ? Who do you think she ’ll back ? ”
102461	102468	102469	102469	I	0	“ You ’re both so childish , ”
102507	102527	102496	102496	Ares	25	“ You know it ’s your fault , right ? You turn me into a childish , petty fool . ”
102537	102545	102496	102496	Ares	25	“ And it ’s my greatest accomplishment . ”
102546	102557	102558	102558	Lex	35	“ Ugh , you two are so disgustingly cute together , ”
102596	102599	102587	102587	Val	89	“ Rave ! ”

103002	103015	102997	102997	she	89	“ That went about as well as I could ’ve hoped for . ”
103016	103019	103020	103020	Zane	40	“ Ivanov ? ”
103023	103060	103020	103020	Zane	40	“ Really , Grandma ? He ’s right , you know . That girl is always throwing a tantrum in public , causing unnecessary drama . She ’s in no way fit to become a Windsor . ”
103064	103073	103074	103074	he	34	“ She ’s a terrible fit for Luca , ”
103077	103090	103074	103074	he	34	“ He does n’t have the patience for her kind of behavior . ”
103091	103096	103097	103097	Sierra	22	“ Yeah , Grandma , ”
103100	103111	103097	103097	Sierra	22	“ This is … this is not a good idea . ”
103121	103131	103132	103132	she	44	“ I took the liberty of having dinner served , ”
103136	103151	103132	103132	she	44	“ Let ’s speak of this no more . Let ’s eat , instead . ”
103166	103172	103173	103173	I	0	“ Are n’t you worried ? ”
103186	103189	103190	103190	he	25	“ No , ”
103193	103200	103190	103190	he	25	“ Grandma truly does know best . ”
103259	103264	103265	103265	Ares	25	“ You seem nervous , ”
103286	103291	103292	103292	I	0	“ Moment of honesty , ”
103295	103349	103292	103292	I	0	“ I ’m scared to face Hannah , and the thought of being surrounded by my family for an entire weekend fills me with anxiety . Every time I ’m here , I feel like I ’m lacking . Besides … this house … it ’s filled with memories of you and her . ”
103366	103372	103373	103373	he	25	“ I ’ll overwrite them , ”
103376	103398	103373	103373	he	25	“ However , Cupcake , if you do n’t want to go , we do n’t have to , you know ? ”

103436	103447	103428	103428	he	25	“ That ’s because I mean everything to my family . ”
103461	103466	103467	103467	he	25	“ I love you , ”
103470	103529	103467	103467	he	25	“ I love you with all my heart , Raven , and I ca n’t stand watching them take you for granted . They ’re your family , and I ’ll always respect and honor your wishes when it comes to them , but know that I do n’t agree with the way you let them treat you . ”

103886	103902	103867	103867	Dad	37	“ And I hid some of those cupcakes you like in your room , sweetheart . ”
103926	103932	103913	103913	I	0	“ Thank you , Dad . ”

104014	104025	104026	104026	He	25	“ I prepared the guest room for you , Ares . ”
104039	104046	104047	104047	he	25	“ I wo n’t need it , ”
104051	104061	104047	104047	he	25	“ I ’ll share a room with my wife . ”
104080	104091	104073	104073	she	32	“ Do n’t you think that ’s somewhat … insensitive ? ”
104097	104128	104092	104092	Ares	25	“ Insensitive ? What is ? To be spending a weekend in the same home as the woman who left me at the altar ? No , not at all . ”
104135	104152	104129	104129	He	25	“ You do n’t mind that , do you ? Or we would n’t be here . ”
104207	104211	104212	104212	I	0	“ Come on , ”
104216	104225	104212	104212	I	0	“ Let ’s go put our stuff upstairs . ”
104279	104291	104292	104292	He	25	“ Hey , I bought you that little cupcake shaped pillow . ”
104315	104332	104333	104333	Ares	25	“ I forget that you have n’t been in my room in years , if ever . ”
104363	104384	104345	104345	He	25	“ Tell me , Cupcake . Is there anything I can do to make this weekend more bearable for you ? ”
104393	104420	104385	104385	I	0	“ Should n’t I be the one to ask that question ? Being here , around Hannah . Is n’t it hard for you , too ? ”
104421	104430	104431	104431	he	25	“ It should be , should n’t it ? ”
104434	104448	104449	104449	He	25	“ But it is n’t . It does n’t affect me at all . ”
104471	104482	104483	104483	He	25	“ How could it , when I ’ve got you ? ”
104504	104507	104508	104508	Mom	32	“ Raven ! ”
104526	104530	104531	104531	I	0	“ Come on , ”
104535	104542	104543	104543	He	25	“ We ’d better head downstairs . ”
104675	104678	104679	104679	Mom	32	“ Raven ! ”
104773	104786	104763	104763	Mom	32	“ Do you think you could quickly help me load the dishwasher ? ”

104827	104875	104823	104823	she	32	“ Do n’t you think it ’d be good for Ares and Hannah to talk through their issues ? Their breakup was messy , and it affected us all . I ’d really like to go back to a time when there was harmony in our home . ”
105004	105007	105008	105008	Mom	32	“ Oh , ”
105011	105018	105008	105008	Mom	32	“ Good . They ’re talking . ”

105351	105364	105344	105344	I	0	“ You know , the one you told me Ares gave you ? ”
105382	105403	105370	105370	she	32	“ No , I stored it away safely . I did n’t want to risk anyone asking questions about it . ”
105435	105443	105444	105444	he	25	“ Just wear it if you want , ”
105448	105468	105444	105444	he	25	“ It ’s a relatively simple piece of jewelry . It ’s nothing but a relic from the past . ”
105515	105519	105520	105520	she	32	“ You know , ”
105523	105553	105520	105520	she	32	“ Tonight is the first night in years that the three of us will all be spending the night here . We should play some board games or something . ”
105565	105571	105572	105572	he	25	“ Perhaps some other night , ”
105581	105587	105572	105572	he	25	“ I ’m pretty tired . ”
105610	105618	105606	105606	Hannah	26	“ How about we head to bed ? ”
105627	105635	105636	105636	I	0	“ You ’ve been quiet all evening , ”
105892	105895	105896	105896	I	0	“ Raven . ”
105939	105942	105943	105943	she	281	“ Ares , ”

106119	106122	106123	106123	she	281	“ Ares , ”
106134	106155	106123	106123	she	281	“ Please do n’t . I ca n’t do this tonight . I ca n’t keep up the pretence tonight . ”
106156	106170	106171	106171	She	281	“ We stopped pretending long ago , Raven , and you know it . ”
106187	106191	106192	106192	she	281	“ Did we ? ”
106195	106222	106192	106192	she	281	“ Or are we just fooling ourselves ? Even my mother is trying to push you two back together , and it ’s exhausting , Ares . ”
106252	106294	106295	106295	I	0	“ Just now , Hannah mentioned this would be the first time in years that the three of us would be spending the night in the same house , did n’t she ? Do you know why that is , Ares ? ”
106361	106371	106372	106372	she	281	“ It ’s because I could hear you two , ”
106375	106434	106372	106372	she	281	“ That wall my bed is pushed up against ? Hannah ’s bed is on the other side of that wall . Every single time you stayed over , I could hear you two . I could hear her moaning your name . I could hear how badly you wanted her , how loving you were with her . ”
106439	106484	106485	106485	She	1307	“ I thought I was over it , you know ? But the memories still plague me . It still hurts , Ares . I thought I ’d be able to deal with the pain , but seeing you with her today ? I … ”
106695	106698	106699	106699	I	0	“ No , ”
106716	106804	106805	106805	She	1307	“ I ’m not letting you go . I ’m sorry , baby . I ’m so fucking sorry . I ca n’t erase those memories , but I swear to you that they do n’t matter as much as the present , and if you let me , I ’ll try to overwrite them , okay ? Is n’t that what I promised you in the car ? Fuck the past , Cupcake . All I care about is you and me , here and now . ”
106908	106911	106912	106912	she	1307	“ Ares , ”
106941	106965	106966	106966	I	0	“ Just looking at you has me hard , baby . You have no idea what you do to me , do you ? ”
107025	107032	107033	107033	She	24	“ You smell like fucking cupcakes . ”
107049	107057	107033	107033	She	24	“ It ’s the soap I use . ”
107083	107097	107076	107076	she	24	“ You ’re already wet for me , are n’t you , baby ? ”
107134	107137	107138	107138	she	24	“ Ares , ”
107141	107148	107138	107138	she	24	“ I need you closer tonight . ”
107174	107185	107152	107152	I	0	“ Yeah ? Tell me what you want , Raven . ”
107186	107217	107218	107218	I	0	“ I want you to fuck me , Ares . I need you to take me hard and rough . Make it impossible for me to think of anything else . ”
107273	107283	107284	107284	She	24	“ You want my cock that badly , baby ? ”
107314	107317	107318	107318	she	1307	“ Ares , ”
107329	107332	107333	107333	I	0	“ Nah , ”
107336	107356	107333	107333	I	0	“ I ’m not having any of that . I ’ll make you scream my name tonight , baby . ”
107455	107460	107461	107461	I	0	“ You know what ? ”
107481	107493	107494	107494	She	1307	“ Get on your hands and knees for me , Cupcake . ”

107799	107805	107806	107806	she	1307	“ It ’s too deep , ”
107809	107812	107813	107813	I	0	“ No , ”
107817	107835	107813	107813	I	0	“ You can take it , baby . Look at how well you ’re taking my cock . ”
107836	107840	107841	107841	she	1307	“ Oh God , ”
107879	107900	107867	107867	I	0	“ When you moan like that , I ca n’t hold it , baby . You drive me fucking insane . ”

108105	108119	108120	108120	She	1307	“ There ’s no fucking way I ’ll let you fall asleep tonight . ”
108215	108222	108223	108223	he	1320	“ And then the spaceship explodes , ”
108242	108253	108257	108257	he	1320	“ I think something like that already exists , Nick . ”
108273	108281	108282	108282	Hannah	26	“ Yeah , but this is better . ”
108294	108299	108300	108300	she	26	“ Stop harassing Ares , ”
108357	108377	108378	108378	Hannah	26	“ Just giving him some good ideas . You ’ll thank me when Raven and Ares become filthy rich . ”
108390	108414	108415	108415	He	1327	“ My wife and I are already rich , buddy . I ’ll take your ideas under consideration , though . Thank you . ”
108435	108441	108442	108442	Hannah	26	“ Do n’t mind him , ”
108467	108479	108480	108480	she	26	“ It ’s truly over between us , is n’t it ? ”

108505	108598	108495	108495	She	26	“ For so long , I was certain that you ’d want to be with me in three years . I must ’ve been insane to think you ’d stay away from Raven the entire time , that nothing would happen between you two . I trusted you both too much . I always knew she secretly had a thing for you , but you … I did n’t think you ’d ever reciprocate those feelings . I did n’t think you ’d ever see her as anything but my little sister . ”
108604	108610	108611	108611	I	0	“ She ’s my wife , ”
108615	108650	108611	108611	I	0	“ You act like she and I betrayed you when you ’re the one who walked away . You ca n’t begrudge us our happiness when you ’re the one who pushed us together . ”
108651	108662	108663	108663	I	0	“ You ’ve always wanted her , have n’t you ? ”
108671	108674	108663	108663	I	0	“ What ? ”
108681	108719	108720	108720	She	1329	“ Do n’t even bother denying it . Do you know how many times I heard you moan her name in your sleep ? Did you really think I did n’t realize you were dreaming about her ? ”
108728	108808	108720	108720	She	1329	“ If I ’m truly honest , that ’s one of the reasons I could n’t go through with it . I always felt like I stole you from her , since she was always meant to be your fiancee . I can see it , you know ? I can see why your grandmother picked her , and not me . The two of you have always had a bond that made me jealous . It still does . ”
108826	108838	108839	108839	I	0	“ I ’m sorry it did n’t work out between us , ”
108843	108874	108839	108839	I	0	“ But I ’m not sorry for moving on and finding the happiness we never would ’ve had together . I hope you find your own happiness too , Hannah . ”
108875	108880	108881	108881	she	24	“ I wo n’t , ”
108885	108920	108881	108881	she	24	“ No one can make me as happy as you do , Ares . Despite everything that happened , despite the fact that you ’re married to my sister , I still want you . ”
108975	108979	108980	108980	I	0	“ Excuse me , ”
108984	108987	108988	108988	she	26	“ Ares ! ”

109133	109148	109149	109149	I	0	“ I ca n’t keep my eyes off you in this pretty white dress , ”
109184	109192	109193	109193	She	26	“ You ’re wearing panties , huh ? ”
109215	109220	109221	109221	she	26	“ It seemed appropriate , ”
109225	109235	109221	109221	she	26	“ being at my parents ’ house and all . ”
109256	109259	109260	109260	I	0	“ Baby , ”

109402	109407	109408	109408	I	0	“ Look at you , ”
109411	109449	109408	109408	I	0	“ Desperate for my cock in your parents ’ guest bathroom , a house full of people surrounding us . But you do n’t care , do you ? You ’re going to come for me nonetheless . ”

109898	109957	109958	109958	I	0	“ And each time you feel my cum drip down your thighs , I want you the remember how much I fucking want you . I ’ve never wanted anyone the way I want you , Raven . I ’ve never loved anyone the way I love you . You ’re it for me . No matter what . ”
110193	110222	110223	110223	She	26	“ It was n’t enough that you stole him from me , huh ? You just had to fuck him all night knowing I could hear you two . ”
110231	110286	110225	110225	her	26	“ And now this ? You just had to steal his attention away when we were finally having a civil conversation . What is it that you ’re trying to do ? Did you want to show me how much he wants you ? Do you want to rub in that I lost him ? ”
110300	110354	110355	110355	She	1341	“ No , Hannah . I would never knowingly do that to you . I tried to be quiet last night , and just now … well , it had nothing to do with you . I went inside and Ares followed me . You could ’ve stopped him if you wanted to . ”
110359	110395	110355	110355	She	1341	“ Are you fucking kidding me right now ? You fucking bitch . I do n’t understand why everyone always thinks you ’re so sweet and innocent , when you ’re a vicious fucking slut . ”
110408	110429	110396	110396	I	0	“ Hmm , you might be onto something there . Ares does call me his little slut , after all . ”
110449	110555	110445	110445	I	0	“ I ’m done indulging you . You put me through hell for years , and I always gave in , because that ’s just how it ’s always been between us . Not anymore , Hannah . Walking away from Ares is the best thing you ever could ’ve done for me , but it ’s also the worst thing you ever could ’ve done to me . Your blatant disregard for my happiness and my plans for my future is disgusting . I ’m done hoping that someday , you ’ll go back to being the big sister I once looked up to . ”
110572	110580	110581	110581	she	1342	“ Do n’t give me that shit , ”
110585	110598	110581	110581	she	1342	“ Do n’t try to change the subject and shift the blame . ”
110608	110624	110599	110599	I	0	“ I would n’t dare . That ’s your area of expertise , after all . ”
110630	110689	110627	110627	her	1342	“ Tell me honestly , Raven . Why did you take my place on my wedding day ? We both know Grandma Anne would ’ve allowed us to postpone the wedding if you had n’t . Despite her threats , she ’d never have forced you . She loves you far too much to do that to you . ”
110693	110697	110690	110690	I	0	“ I know . ”
110702	110706	110698	110698	Her	1342	“ Then why ? ”
110707	110798	110809	110809	her	1343	“ Because I ’ve been in love with him for years . Ever since an engagement between him and me was first discussed . My feelings never wavered . I ’ve loved him since before you even met him . My biggest regret in life was introducing you two , so when I was given a chance to remedy that , I took it . Can you really blame me for chasing my dreams by walking down that aisle , when walking away from it allowed you to chase yours ? ”
110799	110804	110805	110805	she	1343	“ You disgust me , ”
110816	110861	110805	110805	she	1343	“ All these years , you lusted after my fiancé , spending time with him , pretending to be his friend , when all along , you wanted him . Was it ever more than that ? Did you two ever cross the line ? ”
110882	110885	110886	110886	I	0	“ No , ”
110890	110903	110886	110886	I	0	“ Ares never crossed the line with me . Not even once . ”
110942	110995	110921	110921	she	1343	“ Hannah , why are you chasing after him when you ’re the one who left him at the altar ? Why do you continuously attempt to get between us even though we ’re married ? Do I truly mean nothing to you ? Does my happiness truly not matter to you ? ”
111011	111044	111007	111007	she	1343	“ I want you to be happy , Raven . But not with the man I love . Not with the man I planned a future with and share a past with . ”
111055	111084	111045	111045	I	0	“ But I am , Hannah . I ’m happy with him , and I think he ’s happy with me too . Ca n’t you see that ? ”
111099	111159	111085	111085	I	0	“ Over the last few months , you and I have destroyed the strenuous relationship we had , and what for ? I wo n’t leave him , Hannah . Even if I tried , he would n’t let me . He loves me just as much as I love him . You realize that , do n’t you ? ”
111160	111163	111164	111164	she	1347	“ Love , ”
111173	111226	111164	111164	she	1347	“ Are you seriously standing here and telling me he fell in love with your after , what ? Four , five months of marriage ? Do n’t be ridiculous . This is a rebound , and I ’ll let him have it , but it ’ll never be more than that . ”
111234	111240	111241	111241	I	0	“ Maybe you ’re right , ”
111244	111322	111241	111241	I	0	“ But even so , I ’m his wife . I ’ll be his wife for at least the next two and a half years , but we both know it ’ll be far longer than that . Even if you ’re right , and what he feels for me is n’t true love … then that ’s fine for me , Hannah . I love him enough to wait until he eventually truly loves me back . ”
111330	111335	111336	111336	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
111340	111343	111344	111344	she	1348	“ No , ”

111365	111417	111358	111358	I	0	“ Do you want me in your life ? Because this road you and I are walking … if we see this through , there ’s no going back . I love you , Han . You know that I do . But I wo n’t sacrifice any more for you . ”
111423	111441	111420	111420	her	1348	“ You say that as though you ’ve ever had to sacrifice anything for me at all . ”
111451	111577	111442	111442	I	0	“ You would n’t be standing here today if I had n’t sacrificed anything for you . Similarly , I would n’t exist without you . We both know that Mom and Dad only had me because they needed my bone marrow to save your life . I ’ve spent my entire life living in your shadow , Hannah , giving into anything you wanted , supporting you in any way I could think of , even if it meant making myself small and invisible . I ’m done . I ’m done being taken for granted . I ’m done being pushed around . I love you , but I ca n’t have you in my life if all you bring me is sorrow . ”
111586	111591	111592	111592	she	26	“ You ’re right , ”
111595	111665	111592	111592	she	26	“ I ’ll never forgive you for going after Ares the way you did , Raven . I wo n’t give up on him either . If that means that I ’ll have to sacrifice my relationship with you , then so be it . Let ’s be real . We both hate each other anyway . The only reason we tolerate each other is because we have to . ”
111713	111718	111719	111719	I	0	“ I loved you , ”
111727	111774	111719	111719	I	0	“ I ’m pretty sure I loved you from the moment I took my first breath , and I ’ll love you until I take my last . It kills me that you do n’t feel the same way , but at least I know now . ”
111789	111848	111775	111775	I	0	“ You ’re toxic , Hannah . Not just to me , but to yourself . It is n’t just me you ’re losing today , you know ? With each passing day , you lose more of yourself , too . But you know what ? It is n’t my job to save you . Not anymore . ”
112379	112389	112365	112365	she	24	“ Hey ... why are you smiling like that ? ”

My life is no longer empty , and I no longer crave the validation my career used to give me . I ’m going to shift my focus and go all - in with my fashion line . I think I might also want to take an interest in Windsor Media , if that ’s okay ? ”
113310	113349	113350	113350	She	24	“ I ’d love nothing more . You and I would do amazing things together , Rave . We could bring your fashion line under the Windsor umbrella too , so we can push more funding into it . ”

That night when I gave you your new tablet too , you mentioned working as an escape . You were clearly trying to get someone out of your system , and I need to know … are you over him now ? ”

116000	116007	116008	116008	Ares	25	“ What is it , Ben ? ”
116017	116064	116011	116011	Ben	90	“ Hannah Du Pont is at the gate . We ’ve denied her entry , but she does n’t seem to be in a good state of mind . I would recommend that we let her in before she causes a scene and attracts the media . ”
116112	116117	116118	116118	I	0	“ Let her in , ”
116264	116272	116273	116273	she	26	“ I see you renovated the place , ”
116398	116407	116408	116408	she	26	“ I ’m sorry to drop by unannounced , ”
116474	116486	116487	116487	She	26	“ I … there ’s no easy way to say this . ”
116497	116505	116489	116489	her	26	“ I ’m … I ’m pregnant . ”
116606	116622	116604	116604	Ares	25	“ I ’m five months along . The baby is , of course , yours . ”
116660	116759	116650	116650	he	25	“ I did n’t realize it for the longest time . You know how irregular my periods are , Ares . It is n’t until I started to gain weight inexplicably that I thought of doing a pregnancy test . I ’ve had no symptoms whatsoever . No morning sickness , no indications at all . I was n’t even showing until two weeks ago . I … it ’s a high - risk pregnancy , Ares , and I just … I need you . I ca n’t do this by myself , and I ’m scared . ”
116882	116888	116889	116889	he	25	“ I need a doctor , ”
116892	116905	116889	116889	he	25	“ Send a doctor to my home within the next ten minutes . ”
116911	116918	116919	116919	she	26	“ You do n’t believe me ? ”
116928	116934	116935	116935	he	25	“ Just covering my bases , ”
116938	116970	116935	116935	he	25	“ If you ’re carrying my child , it ’s important that we check your health , is n’t it ? Especially if it truly is a high - risk pregnancy . ”
117148	117151	117152	117152	Ares	25	“ Raven , ”
117170	117196	117159	117159	He	25	“ I ’m yours , no matter what . There ’s nothing you and I ca n’t get through , and this is no different . ”
117197	117206	117207	117207	I	0	“ How is this not different , Ares ? ”
117212	117222	117223	117223	He	25	“ It ’s a child . An innocent life . ”
117230	117249	117223	117223	He	25	“ Yeah , it is . But let ’s take this one step at a time , okay ? ”
117295	117349	117288	117288	He	1423	“ She ’s five months pregnant . The baby is healthy , but the mother is under too much duress . She ’s been battling anxiety and insomnia . Her blood pressure is far higher than I ’d like it to be too . You ’ll need to take good care of her . ”
117472	117475	117476	117476	I	0	“ Raven ? ”

117661	117670	117671	117671	He	25	“ Did you cheat on me , Ares ? ”
117683	117686	117687	117687	he	25	“ No , ”
117703	117724	117695	117695	He	25	“ Never . I never will either . This wo n’t change anything for us unless you want it to . ”
117751	117819	117820	117820	His	25	“ Give me a moment of honesty , Ares . Do you want this to change things between us ? Are you phrasing it that way because you want me to be the bigger person and walk away ? Are you asking me to do what you wo n’t , so you do n’t have to feel guilty for choosing your child and its mother over me ? ”
117832	117837	117838	117838	he	25	“ Moment of honesty , ”
117841	117937	117838	117838	he	25	“ I ’m silently praying that you ’ll tell me that this does n’t impact us , and that we ’ll find a way to get through this together . I was so proud of you for standing your ground and cutting Hannah off , and now we ’re forced to accept her into our lives in ways that we both deemed unimaginable . I ’m scared of hurting you , of asking too much . I do n’t know what the right thing to do is , so I need you to tell me . ”
117944	117950	117951	117951	I	0	“ I wish I knew , ”
117954	118066	117951	117951	I	0	“ I wish I had the right words for you right now , but I do n’t . The only thing I do know is that it ca n’t be the child that suffers . I ’ll be there for you , Ares , in whatever capacity you need . I ’ll raise this child with you , if that ’s what you want . There ’s no doubt in my mind that I love you , and though it might be hard , I know I ’ll love your daughter or son the same . What I do n’t know is if I can survive having Hannah in our lives . ”
118317	118322	118308	118308	she	26	“ Where is Raven ? ”
118395	118412	118413	118413	Hannah	26	“ She ’s at work . She barely slept and rushed out early in the morning . ”
118416	118449	118413	118413	Hannah	26	“ It must be hard for her , to know that we ’re having a baby together . I can imagine that now , even more so , she regrets marrying you . ”
118583	118587	118588	118588	I	0	“ Are we ? ”
118591	118604	118588	118588	I	0	“ Are we having a baby together ? Is the child mine ? ”
118657	118669	118670	118670	she	26	“ Of course , Ares . What … how could you … ”
118681	118718	118670	118670	she	26	“ Raven has truly made you hate me , has n’t she ? How did she do it ? How did she unravel a love that lasted years , in the span of a few months ? ”
118733	118738	118739	118739	I	0	“ She has n’t , ”
118746	118796	118739	118739	I	0	“ No one has the power to make another stop loving someone , Hannah . She did n’t steal me away from you . You and I were done long before you chose to walk away . What you and I had … it was born out of obligation . ”
118797	118807	118808	118808	I	0	“ And what you have with her is n’t ? ”
118816	118878	118813	118813	my	0	“ No . It ’s different with her . I had no intention of making it work with her . If anything , I wanted to give her as much freedom as she possibly could ’ve wanted . I had no expectations when it came to Raven , yet over time , I found myself wanting more and more of her . ”
118888	118917	118879	118879	I	0	“ I think you know as well as I do that what I have with her was years in the making . I just did n’t realize it . ”
118929	118968	118926	118926	she	1460	“ Is this really what it ’s going to be like , Ares ? Is our child going to grow up with parents that ca n’t even have one single conversation that is n’t drenched in mutual resentment ? ”
118999	119025	119026	119026	She	1460	“ If you and I are having a child together , we ’ll need to come to an agreement about how we ’re raising it . ”
119036	119044	119032	119032	her	1460	“ You want to adopt the baby ? ”
119048	119123	119032	119032	her	1460	“ Let ’s be real , Hannah . You ca n’t raise a child , but I can . Raven and I can . I want full custody , and you ’ll get full visitation rights . You ’ll be able to continue filming and working . Your life wo n’t be impacted at all , and our child will be raised in a loving home . He or she wo n’t lack anything . ”
119142	119152	119153	119153	she	26	“ I will never give up on my child , ”
119160	119171	119156	119156	her	26	“ How could you ask something like that of me ? ”
119172	119234	119235	119235	She	26	“ I ’m not asking you to give the baby up , Hannah . You ’d be able to see our child whenever you wanted . Surely this is in your best interests , too ? You ’ve always loved your career above all else . This will allow you to see your child without the obligations motherhood would bring you . ”
119240	119329	119237	119237	her	26	“ Do you think I ’m stupid , Ares ? Do you really think I ’ll let you take away my child ? I sign away my rights , and next thing I know , I ’m cut out of your lives . I wo n’t let that happen . Tell me , was that Raven ’s idea ? Is n’t it enough for her to be a home wrecker ? Is n’t it enough that she ’s forcing this child to grow up in a broken home ? ”
119330	119335	119336	119336	I	0	“ Watch your mouth , ”
119339	119430	119336	119336	I	0	“ I ’m fucking sick of you putting words in her mouth and blaming her for things she has n’t done . You walked away , Hannah . End of story . Raven is my wife , and so help me God , you will respect her . Do n’t try this fucking shit with me . She might let you get away with this bullshit , but I wo n’t . If you ’re going to be part of our lives , you ’d better learn your fucking place . ”
119447	119451	119452	119452	she	1462	“ Well done , ”
119456	119601	119452	119452	she	1462	“ You ’ve become such a good whipped little puppy . What the hell has she done to you , huh ? Do you really think I do n’t realize that these are n’t your words ? I ’ve been with you for years , Ares , and in all that time , you ’ve never once spoken to me that way , no matter how bad our arguments got . Yet now , with Raven around , you ’re suddenly acting all different , and I ’m supposed to believe it is n’t because of her ? Is this how our child is going to grow up , Ares ? With a father that disrespects their mother because their slut of a stepmom told him to ? What else will you do to our child and me just because she tells you to ? ”
119608	119678	119679	119679	She	1463	“ You never fucking knew me at all , Hannah . You wonder why I fell for her so hard , so quickly ? It ’s because I never loved you in the first place . You were an obligation , someone I tolerated and placated because I had no other choice . I never lost my patience with you because I never truly gave a fuck about you . ”
119688	119698	119699	119699	she	1463	“ Is that what helps you sleep at night ? ”
119709	119738	119699	119699	she	1463	“ Are you truly going to stand here and reduce everything we shared to a mere obligation ? Is that what our child is to you , too ? ”
119749	119840	119739	119739	She	1463	“ Does no part of you want to raise this baby with me ? Do n’t you want what ’s best for our child ? Are you truly so blinded by Raven that you ca n’t see how much you ’re hurting me ? How much your actions will end up hurting our baby ? She ’ll never love our child the way I ’ll love them . How could she possibly accept and love a kid that is n’t hers , that reminds her of your past with me ? ”
119894	119897	119898	119898	she	1464	“ Ares , ”
119904	119913	119898	119898	she	1464	“ I … I do n’t feel well . ”
119947	119955	119925	119925	I	0	“ Fuck ! Get me a doctor ! ”
120550	120560	120561	120561	she	44	“ You ’re carrying my first great - grandchild , ”
120570	120582	120583	120583	She	44	“ You need to take good care of yourself , Hannah . ”
120589	120625	120583	120583	She	44	“ The same goes for you . She ’s carrying your child , Ares . I know the situation is n’t ideal , but we ’ll make the best of it — as a family . ”
120637	120722	120723	120723	Grandma	44	“ I came here because I agree , Grandma . I thought my sister and Ares would be the two people that ’d be most supportive . I thought I ’d be safe from the press here while we try to figure out how our lives are going to change now , but they do n’t want me here . Ares asked me to leave , and I … I think I should . I never should ’ve come here in the first place . ”
120729	120821	120723	120723	Grandma	44	“ The doctor put you on bed rest , Hannah . I ’d like you to stay here until you feel better . It ’ll be good for Ares , Raven , and you to be together . After all , this pregnancy entwines all three of your fates . The more you avoid each other , the bigger the blow - outs when you ’re eventually forced to face each other . For the sake of my great - grandchild , you need to learn to put aside your differences . ”
120822	120825	120826	120826	Ares	25	“ No , ”
120848	120882	120834	120834	He	25	“ She ca n’t stay here . I understand your intentions , Grandma , and I agree that we need to learn to co - exist , but now is not the time . ”
120889	120972	120883	120883	Grandma	44	“ There ’s no better time than the present , Ares . In a mere four months , you ’ll be a father . This is n’t something you can run away from . This kind of thing is better faced head - on . The three of you need to learn how to co - parent , because your child is going to need you , and you can not allow him or her to be raised in a hostile environment . ”
120994	121002	120987	120987	she	44	“ Do n’t you agree , Raven ? ”
121080	121083	121084	121084	he	25	“ Baby , ”
121102	121109	121110	121110	I	0	“ You can have this room , ”
121253	121256	121257	121257	I	0	“ Raven ! ”
121288	121296	121284	121284	her	44	“ Are you okay , my darling ? ”
121300	121304	121284	121284	her	44	“ Of course . ”
121309	121409	121305	121305	Grandma	44	“ This is all my fault . I can see you ’re hurting , Raven . You would n’t be in this situation if not for me . I ’m the one who demanded that you marry Ares , but I should have known that it was too late for the two of you . Throughout the years , fate has brought Hannah and Ares together over and over again . I was foolish to think I could untangle their destinies . My attempts to do so have harmed you , and for that , I am forever sorry . ”
121415	121481	121410	121410	I	0	“ No , Grandma . It ’s okay , I promise . Ares and I will be okay . You were right about us , and I ’ve never once blamed you for the situation we were put in . If anything , I owe you a great debt for it . The last couple of months have been the happiest I ’ve ever been . ”
121492	121532	121488	121488	her	1493	“ But that happiness ca n’t last , Raven . It wo n’t . My sweet girl , do you think I did n’t notice the pain in your beautiful eyes each time you were around Hannah and Ares ? ”
121575	121698	121572	121572	everyone	2108	“ I do n’t want to watch you lose your spirit over the next couple of months or years , Raven . He might be angry and shocked right now , but we both know that his protective instincts will kick in soon enough . It wo n’t take long for him to realize that she truly is carrying his baby . He ’d do anything for his child , do n’t you think ? Can you bear watching him worry about her ? Will your heart stay intact when he places his hand on her belly to feel the baby kick ? All of those moments they ’ll share that you ca n’t be part of are bound to hurt you . ”
121709	121720	121572	121572	everyone	2108	“ Then what would you have me do , Grandma ? ”
121721	121851	121852	121852	She	1495	“ My sweet girl , I do n’t know what the right thing to do is , but I want you to think about your own happiness . This is n’t what I wanted for you . For years , I watched you wither away because of your love for Ares . I do n’t want you to go through that again . You should have a love so grand that everything else pales in comparison . You should never come second to anyone else , and you should n’t have to fight over a man ’s attention . But that ’s the fate that awaits you with Ares . Hannah wo n’t let him leave her clutches , and the new bonds between them ca n’t be broken . ”
121865	121902	121852	121852	She	1495	“ I love you just as much as I love Sierra . I have always seen you as one of my own , Raven . Long before you married Ares , I considered you a Windsor . ”
121925	121979	121912	121912	her	1495	“ My sweet girl , if you want to be set free , I ’ll let you go . I ’ll give you half of Windsor Media and all my support . I never should have asked you to marry Ares in the first place . Let me right my wrongs , Raven . ”
121988	121997	121980	121980	I	0	“ Are you asking me to divorce Ares ? ”
122003	122091	122000	122000	her	44	“ No , Raven . I would never ask that of you . I would want nothing more than to keep you in our lives . What I ’m asking you to do is to choose yourself . Choose happiness . Prioritize yourself . No one else is going to do it for you , child . It is my hope that you ’ll think things through and choose Ares regardless , but I want you to know that you have my support if you decide otherwise . ”
122383	122386	122375	122375	she	26	“ Rave ? ”
122409	122420	122421	122421	she	26	“ God , I ’m just hungry all the time , ”
122478	122491	122465	122465	She	26	“ How are you holding up ? You ’ve been so quiet . ”
122522	122527	122528	122528	Hannah	26	“ I ’m fine . ”
122536	122541	122542	122542	she	26	“ I get it , ”
122545	122586	122542	122542	she	26	“ It ’s strange to think that Ares and I are going to be parents . The situation is complicated , for sure . But we ’ll make the best of it , wo n’t we ? We always do . ”
122619	122644	122614	122614	she	26	“ Ares and I are getting an ultrasound soon to check if we can find out the gender . Do you want to come ? ”
122651	122684	122645	122645	She	26	“ You ’ll be part of our child ’s life too . I want you to feel included . The four of us are going to be a family , after all . ”
122695	122699	122685	122685	I	0	“ Sounds great , ”
122706	122759	122685	122685	I	0	“ It ’s odd , is n’t it ? The way all the pieces fell back into place . It ’s almost as if destiny is intervening , showing us all that Ares and I are meant to be together . The only puzzle piece that ’s out of place is you . ”
122769	122786	122766	122766	she	26	“ Sorry . I did n’t mean it that way . That came out all wrong . ”
122801	122895	122896	122896	She	26	“ I wonder how he ’ll feel once our child starts asking why Mommy and Daddy ca n’t live together . There are so many questions going through my mind , you know ? What will it be like when we need to attend parent - teacher meetings ? Will all three of us go ? And what about the immediate future ? Are you both going to be there when I go into labor ? Are you going to wake up in the middle of the night and help with nightly feeds ? ”
122904	122938	122939	122939	She	26	“ I know that I have n’t been myself recently , but this pregnancy makes me see everything through fresh eyes . Nothing matters more than the wellbeing of my child , Raven . ”
122942	122948	122939	122939	She	26	“ You would n’t understand . ”
122954	122973	122949	122949	She	26	“ I guess you never will . Ares always said he only wanted one child , after all . ”
122988	122991	122992	122992	I	0	“ Hannah , ”
122999	123092	122992	122992	I	0	“ I do n’t have any answers for you , but then again , it is n’t answers you want from me , is it ? Why do n’t we stop playing games ? I hear you , Han . You think I ’m obstructing the happy family you would ’ve had if I had n’t married Ares , and maybe I am . But even if I walk away now , you ca n’t go back to what you used to have . Ca n’t you see that he loves me ? ”
123105	123173	123093	123093	She	1507	“ I can see that he ’s infatuated . It ’ll pass . The love he thinks he feels for you wo n’t surpass the love he ’ll direct toward his child . Ares is a man of honor , and he ’s going to do whatever it takes to give his child the life it deserves . What do you think that ’ll mean for you ? ”
123179	123215	123216	123216	She	1508	“ How is this even supposed to work ? Are you going to admit to the whole world that you slept with your sister ’s husband ? Are you truly willing to risk your reputation ? ”
123221	123279	123216	123216	She	1508	“ Why would n’t I ? After all , I ’ve got years ’ worth of evidence proving that it ’s me he dated . If I spin a tale about how we were ruthlessly torn apart because of the Windsor family ’s rules , the media will paint a picture of two star - crossed lovers . ”
123292	123315	123316	123316	She	1508	“ This is going to turn into a huge scandal , Hannah . How is that supposed to benefit any of us ? ”
123319	123374	123375	123375	She	1508	“ I know , but I wo n’t let my child grow up as a dirty secret . He or she will be a Windsor , after all . I wo n’t let Ares hide our baby . If not for you , we ’d be able to raise our son or daughter together . ”
123379	123468	123375	123375	She	1508	“ If you leave quietly and allow us a chance to revive our relationship , I ’ll keep my silence too . I ’ll retire , and soon enough , no one is going to care that I had a child , let alone who the father might be . My baby will be able to grow up with both parents , in a loving home . Ares has enough connections to ensure your career wo n’t be impacted . We ’ll keep the rumors to a minimum . ”
123499	123502	123503	123503	I	0	“ No , ”
123507	123692	123503	123503	I	0	“ I ’m not going anywhere , and the sooner you accept that , the sooner we can figure out how to handle the PR surrounding your pregnancy . Hannah , no matter what you do , you wo n’t be able to sway Ares . There ’s a lot I ’m uncertain about , but the love between us is n’t one of those things . Whether you like it or not , I ’m going to be by his side every step of the way . That means I ’ll be a permanent fixture in your child ’s life , too . These moments you think you ’ll have with him ? They wo n’t happen , because I ’ll be there too . You wo n’t be able to use your child to get to him . I suggest you start focusing on what truly is best for your son or daughter , because I assure you , alienating me is n’t one of those things . I will , after all , play a key role in raising the baby . ”
123741	123744	123745	123745	Ares	25	“ Hannah ! ”
123768	123772	123773	123773	he	25	“ What happened ? ”
123777	123795	123796	123796	He	25	“ Did you upset her somehow ? Her blood pressure is already too high as it is . ”
123899	123908	123909	123909	Sierra	22	“ I ca n’t believe she ’s pregnant , ”
123918	123928	123909	123909	Sierra	22	“ This ca n’t be happening , can it ? ”
124032	124035	124036	124036	I	0	“ Yep , ”
124042	124054	124055	124055	Sierra	22	“ You ’re going to be an aunt soon . Congrats . ”
124062	124069	124059	124059	her	22	“ Yeah , you … too ? ”
124114	124146	124147	124147	Sierra	22	“ Grandma told me she ’d let me go if I want to . She ’ll let us get a divorce . I guess Operation Happily Ever After failed , huh ? ”
124153	124158	124147	124147	Sierra	22	“ Are you serious ? ”
124168	124204	124159	124159	I	0	“ She told me that she just wants me to be happy , but I ca n’t tell if it was just a way of asking me to do the right thing and divorce him . ”
124210	124222	124207	124207	her	22	“ No one but Ares and you get to decide that . ”
124226	124265	124223	124223	I	0	“ I agree , but there ’s some truth to what she told me . I spent my entire life loving your brother , and what for ? In the end , she ’s still standing between us . ”
124277	124284	124266	124266	Sierra	22	“ Someone disabled my security system . ”
124304	124307	124308	124308	Sierra	22	“ Ares ! ”
124380	124383	124384	124384	he	25	“ Enough , ”
124396	124444	124384	124384	he	25	“ I ’ve given you a few days to process what happened , but that ’s as much as I ’ll give you . You ’re done running , beautiful . No more avoiding me . That ’s not how we deal with our problems , remember ? ”
124604	124607	124608	124608	he	25	“ Raven , ”
124611	124650	124608	124608	he	25	“ Can we talk , please ? All you ’ve done is work or run off to Sierra ’s . You once asked me for honest and open communication , and I now ask the same of you . ”
124659	124677	124651	124651	I	0	“ Ares , I just do n’t know what to say . That ’s all it is . ”
124702	124752	124698	124698	he	25	“ I ’m not asking you to tell me pretty and calculated words , Raven . I ’ve never once wanted that from you . I want your raw , unfiltered truth . Tell me every single one of your fears , so I can take them all away . ”
124793	124801	124775	124775	I	0	“ You want the truth , Ares ? ”
124846	124894	124840	124840	him	1524	“ I hate who I am around Hannah and you . I hate the thoughts I have , the things I feel . I ’m not a bad person , Ares , yet more than once , I wished the child Hannah is expecting did n’t exist . ”
124925	124930	124931	124931	he	25	“ So have I , ”
124940	125056	124931	124931	he	25	“ I know the child is innocent , Rave . Of course I know that , but I ’ve also wished that she was n’t pregnant . The happiness we found was so hard - fought , and the last thing I want to do is allow something to threaten that . Is it wrong that your happiness matters more to me than my unborn child does ? Perhaps so , but that is my truth . I ’m not a horrible person either , Raven , and I have no doubt you and I will both love this child beyond measure once he or she arrives … but we ’re only human , baby . ”
125085	125148	125149	125149	He	1525	“ I ’m scared I ’ll have to watch you fall for her all over again . I do n’t want to watch you care about her and celebrate each pregnancy milestone together . I do n’t want to hear about scans and cots and fucking pregnancy vitamins . I do n’t want her to have everything that I wanted with you . ”
125164	125210	125149	125149	He	1525	“ I ’ll do what I can to minimize that kind of thing . With Grandma forcing us to welcome her into our home , that is more complicated than I ’d like it to be , but we ’ll make it work , Cupcake . ”
125222	125254	125255	125255	He	1525	“ But you should n’t have to , Ares . This is such a beautiful experience , and if not for me , you ’d be enjoying every second of it . ”
125267	125299	125264	125264	his	1525	“ There ’s no point in wondering about what - ifs , my love . You are my wife , my everything . You always will be . No matter what . ”
125300	125404	125405	125405	I	0	“ I ’m scared that just is n’t true . I ’m scared I ’ll lose you to her all over again . How do I compete with the history you two share ? The child you ’ll share ? The bonds between you are endless , and no matter what angle I look at this from , I ’m what stands between two people that have always loved each other . I was always just her stand - in , Ares , and she ’s finally ready to take her place by your side . This is everything you ’ve ever wanted . ”
125464	125469	125470	125470	he	25	“ No , Raven , ”
125480	125684	125470	125470	he	25	“ You are all that I ’ve ever wanted . I ’ve never been this happy before , baby . You fucking complete me , Cupcake . You ’re the part I never realized I was missing . You ’re my heart , my soul . It does n’t matter how many years I spent with Hannah , because just a few months with you brought me more happiness than years with her ever did . If she and I were meant to be together , we ’d have made it work , Rave . If I truly loved her , I never would ’ve fallen for you , and certainly not so quickly . Hell , if I loved her the way you seem to think I do , I ’d never have let her go in the first place . I hear you , baby . I hear you , and I understand your fears , but trust me when I tell you that nothing she could do will make me waver . You ’re the only one I ’ll ever love , Raven . No man could have you and walk away from you . I know I ca n’t . ”
125685	125690	125691	125691	I	0	“ But you have , ”
125701	125741	125742	125742	He	1527	“ You have , and I ’m terrified you ’ll do it again . I barely survived it the first time , but it ’ll destroy me this time around , Ares . I ca n’t do this again . ”
125752	125759	125742	125742	He	1527	“ What are you talking about ? ”
125760	125766	125767	125767	I	0	“ Sierra ’s 21st birthday , ”
125770	125898	125767	125767	I	0	“ I … I came to your room at night . We ’d both been drinking too much , but it did n’t matter . The drinks were exactly what I needed to gather my courage . At that point , we ’d been informally engaged . Your grandmother and my parents had both agreed on it , but you and I had n’t discussed it . We ’d both just kind of been dancing around the subject , and you ’d been treating me the same way you treated Sierra , the way you ’d always treated me , with playful kindness , and nothing more . I … I came to your room that night to ask what you thought of me and our engagement . ”
125907	125910	125899	125899	He	1528	“ What ? ”
125923	125945	125911	125911	I	0	“ I tried to kiss you , and you told me that I did n’t know what I was asking for … ”
125946	125963	125964	125964	I	0	“ — and you replied that you were n’t as innocent as I thought you were . ”
125973	125979	125964	125964	I	0	“ You … you remember ? ”
125985	126007	125982	125982	his	1528	“ No , but I ’ve dreamed of this night . I ’ve been dreaming about you for years , Raven . ”
126021	126041	126010	126010	his	1528	“ Even when you were the last woman I ever should ’ve desired , you kept my dreams captive . ”
126053	126106	126107	126107	He	1529	“ I gave you my virginity that night , Ares . You told me that there ’d be no going back from that point onwards , and I believed you . You asked me to marry you , and the very next day , you announced that you were dating my sister . ”
126117	126120	126121	126121	he	1529	“ Raven , ”
126124	126140	126121	126121	he	1529	“ The next morning , I … I woke up with Hannah in my bed . ”
126151	126156	126141	126141	I	0	“ W - what ? ”
126174	126248	126249	126249	I	0	“ I remember waking up with a smile on my face , wanting more of you . I turned over , and Hannah was in my bed , naked . She smiled at me and told me that she ’d enjoyed every second of the previous night . She convinced me that the woman I slept with that night was her . Tell me the truth , Raven . Was it really you ? ”
126257	126260	126249	126249	I	0	“ Yes . ”
126265	126321	126261	126261	My	0	“ It was me , Ares . I sneaked out of your room at dawn and went back to Sierra ’s room to freshen up , and by the time I came down for breakfast , you were sitting there with your arm around her , telling everyone you were dating . It broke me . ”
126358	126417	126418	126418	I	0	“ When I woke up with her , I knew I lost my chance with you , Raven . I knew I could never have you after sleeping with your sister . I was as hurt as you were , Cupcake . The one I wanted was never her . It ’s always been you . Only you . ”
126438	126510	126511	126511	I	0	“ Ares , a few days later I tried to talk to you about it . Do you remember ? You were in the living room at Grandma ’s , and I asked you when you got together with Hannah , and what it ’d mean for our engagement . I asked you if you ever felt anything for me , and if I ever meant anything to you at all . ”
126518	126584	126511	126511	I	0	“ I still remember the way my voice trembled , the fear I felt as I voiced those questions . You looked at me with such pity and shot me down . You said that you considered me family , and that you were going to ask Grandma to break our engagement , because you ’d never see me as anything but Hannah ’s sister . ”
126599	126656	126657	126657	He	25	“ You broke my heart , and I never recovered . Throughout the years , the two of you continued to make stabs at my heart , and I ca n’t take much more . I ca n’t do it , Ares . I ’m begging you , please stop destroying what ’s left of me . ”
126678	126683	126684	126684	he	25	“ I love you , ”
126688	126714	126684	126684	he	25	“ I loved you then , and I love you now . Hell , if I ’m truly honest with myself , I never stopped . ”
126735	126762	126725	126725	he	25	“ I thought I lost my chance with you , Raven . I did what I could to ensure I could keep you in our lives . ”
126773	126942	126765	126765	his	25	“ Throughout the years , I took as much as you ’d give me , finding any excuse to spend some time with you . I ’d attend fashion shows under the guise of having to network , just so I could catch a glimpse of you . Most of the time , I could even fool myself , telling myself I was just looking out for you when it was so much more than that . It was wrong and deep down I knew it , but I could n’t stay away . I told myself that it ’d be okay so long as I never crossed the line , but fuck , being around you and not having you … yeah , that fucking killed me . I swear to you , I ’ll spend the rest of our lives making up for lost time . Hannah wo n’t get away with this — I swear it . Raven , I will never hurt you again . ”
126962	126965	126966	126966	he	1532	“ Baby , ”
126976	126983	126966	126966	he	1532	“ I love you , Raven . ”
126995	127007	126984	126984	I	0	“ I love you too , Ares . I always have . ”
127008	127017	127018	127018	he	1532	“ I ’ll never let you go again , ”
127064	127083	127084	127084	he	1532	“ I ’ll never walk away . You ’re it for me , baby . No matter what , ”
127299	127306	127307	127307	I	0	“ Why did you do it ? ”
127327	127331	127317	127317	She	26	“ Do what ? ”
127332	127356	127357	127357	She	26	“ That night … why did you sneak into Ares ’s room ? Why did you pretend it was you he slept with ? ”
127407	127430	127431	127431	She	26	“ For once in your life , be honest with me . Why would you do that to me ? To Ares ? ”
127445	127451	127452	127452	she	26	“ Because I wanted him , ”
127464	127489	127452	127452	she	26	“ I wanted him to look at me the way he always looked at you . I wanted the prestige of being a Windsor . ”
127495	127503	127490	127490	She	26	“ When did you figure it out ? ”
127544	127550	127551	127551	I	0	“ Not until last night , ”
127561	127602	127554	127554	She	26	“ That explains why Ares asked me to leave this morning . He could barely stand to look at me , because of you . If his grandmother had n’t stepped in , he ’d have forcibly thrown me out . ”
127609	127619	127603	127603	She	26	“ You almost got what you wanted . Almost . ”
127689	127725	127726	127726	She	110	“ You put me through years of torment and heartbreak , yet you sit here without an ounce of remorse . I ’m your sister , Hannah . How could you do this to me ? ”
127733	127784	127726	127726	She	110	“ You would n’t even exist if not for me . Mom and Dad only had you because we needed you for the stem cell transplant . You literally only exist to aid my life . Even our parents did n’t want you , Raven . Ca n’t you see ? ”
127796	127836	127785	127785	She	110	“ I ’m the daughter they love most , the partner that ’s the best fit for Ares , the person that ’s best suited to be a Windsor . It just made sense . It was n’t personal . ”
127859	128007	128008	128008	She	1541	“ You ’re the most entitled narcissist I ’ve ever met , and it pains me that we ’re related . I ca n’t do this , Hannah . I ’m done tolerating you . I do n’t want you in my life . The moment you have your child , we ’re done . I vow to love your child like they ’re my own , but you ’re dead to me . I wish I had the courage to cut you out of my life sooner . I wish I ’d recognized your selfishness for the narcissistic behavior it is . For years , I made excuses for you , telling myself and everyone around me that you were only that way because you understandably wanted to live your life to the fullest . I ’m done . I ’m done with you , Hannah . ”
128013	128113	128008	128008	She	1541	“ Is this the part where I ’m supposed to care ? Should I burst into tears and beg you to forgive me ? Because I wo n’t , Raven . I do n’t regret a single thing I ’ve done . The only things I regret are not marrying Ares and underestimating you . I did n’t think you ’d have the guts to truly go after him , but it ’s fine . The situation is still salvageable . So go ahead , my sweet little sister . Get out of my way of your own volition . ”
128146	128150	128141	128141	her	1542	“ You ’re — ”
128205	128224	128196	128199	two of our guards	1547	“ Mrs. Windsor , there has been a security breach . Mr. Windsor is on his way home . ”
128380	128391	128367	128367	he	25	“ I told you that the situation is still salvageable . ”
128401	128406	128407	128407	She	26	“ You did this ? ”
128410	128539	128407	128407	She	26	“ You left me no choice . I told you to walk away while I still gave you a chance . Now the entire world is going to know that you ’re nothing but a cheap replacement for me . Everywhere you go , people will be whispering about how sad it is that he does n’t get to be with me . Once our child is born , public sentiment will turn against you even more so . How long do you think you ’ll last under such scrutiny ? The entire world will be telling you that you ’re a home wrecker . They ’ll tell you that you ’re a disgusting whore for stealing your sister ’s fiancé . Have you checked the comments yet ? ”
128655	128679	128680	128680	She	1553	“ Where does it end , Hannah ? Do you have any idea how damaging this is to my career ? My business ? ”
128685	128723	128680	128680	She	1553	“ It wo n’t end until you return everything you took from me . Even if Ares and I ca n’t make it work , I still wo n’t let you have anything that belongs to me . ”
128735	128763	128680	128680	She	1553	“ He ’s always been mine , from the very start . Even if he was n’t , it ’s me he loves . Then and now . ”
128769	128785	128766	128766	her	1553	“ I can fix that . I did it once before , did n’t I ? ”
128863	128866	128867	128867	Ares	25	“ Cupcake ! ”
128900	128932	128933	128933	He	25	“ I … I c - can’t do this , Ares . I ca n’t l - live like this . I ca n’t … I ca n’t keep doing this . ”
128945	128968	128933	128933	He	25	“ You wo n’t have to . I ’ll fix this , I swear it . I ’ll fix it , baby . ”
128969	128974	128975	128975	My	0	“ You ca n’t . ”
129041	129044	129045	129045	Ares	25	“ Baby , ”
129048	129059	129045	129045	Ares	25	“ Please . Please trust that I ’ll fix this . ”
129067	129070	129071	129071	I	0	“ How ? ”
129074	129115	129071	129071	I	0	“ How will you fix this , Ares ? Articles about us are all over the internet . It is n’t as simple as suing just one single magazine , and even if we do , it ’s too late ! ”
129133	129136	129137	129137	Ares	25	“ Raven , ”
129144	129173	129140	129140	his	25	“ What are you doing , Cupcake ? You ca n’t … do n’t do this . I beg of you , do n’t do this , Raven . ”
129183	129229	129230	129230	He	25	“ I ’m not spending another moment in the same house as her . I ’ve tried , Ares . For years , I ’ve tried , sacrificing my damn soul to keep her happy in the process . I ca n’t take much more . ”
129246	129259	129230	129230	He	25	“ You ’re insane if you think I ’ll let you go . ”
129265	129318	129230	129230	He	25	“ I ’m not giving you a choice , Ares . I ca n’t do this . I ca n’t spend the rest of my life being tormented by my own sister . I ca n’t deal with the constant snide remarks , the guilt trips , the manipulation , the lies . ”
129319	129341	129342	129342	I	0	“ Then I ’ll make her leave , Raven . There ’s nothing I wo n’t do to ensure your happiness . ”
129359	129438	129342	129342	I	0	“ You know your grandmother wo n’t let her leave . She wants Hannah safe and sound in the Windsor compound . She wants the two of you to figure out how to co - parent , and Grandma is n’t going to give up until you two resolve your issues . Hannah is carrying a Windsor baby , Ares . She ’s pregnant with your child . I ca n’t … I just ca n’t do this . ”
129439	129448	129449	129449	I	0	“ What does that mean , my love ? ”
129455	129582	129449	129449	I	0	“ I do n’t know yet , Ares . I just … all I ’m asking for is some time to think , nothing more . I ca n’t be around her right now . I ca n’t sit back and watch her attempt to destroy my life . Not again . I ’m scared that if I stay , I ’ll do or say something I ’ll regret . I ca n’t bite my tongue right now , and the last thing I want to do is harm her health . What happens if I upset her right now , and she faints again ? It ’s your child that ’d be at risk , Ares . I ca n’t have that on my conscience . ”
129611	129641	129642	129642	I	0	“ Besides , I need to think about whether this is truly what I want . There ’s no doubt in my mind that I love you , Ares . ”
129650	129750	129642	129642	I	0	“ But let me give you a moment of honesty . I ’m not sure our love can survive her . She tore us apart once , and we both know she wo n’t stop until she does it again . What kind of life is that ? Your wife and the mother of your child fighting at every turn ? What kind of environment would that create for your son or daughter ? What about me ? What toll will it take on me to constantly be fighting with my sister ? To have her sabotage my marriage ? ”
129766	129840	129755	129755	his	25	“ I know how hard it is , baby . I know I should n’t even be asking this of you , considering everything you ’ve been through so far , everything you have yet to endure , but I ’m not above begging . I ca n’t see a life without you , Raven . I ’m begging you . Please , let ’s find a way to get through this together . ”
129853	130074	129847	129847	my	0	“ I need some space , Ares . All I ’m asking for is a little bit of space to think about what I want . All my life , I ’ve catered to everyone I loved , but not once has anyone asked me what I want out of life . Even marrying you was something I was told to do . I ’m tired of living my life by other people ’s rules . I ca n’t keep doing this . All my life , I ’ve been manipulated , forced to conform until I fit in the boxes others built for me . And I did it — with a smile on my face . What for ? What did I do it for , Ares ? This marriage has cost me my sanity and my career , and that would be worth it if I ’d got you in return , but I did n’t . Even now , after the price I ’ve been forced to pay , it ’s the three of us in this marriage . It always will be . As the mother of your child , she ’ll always be a part of our lives . And I … I do n’t know if that ’s something I can live with . ”
130091	130095	130096	130096	he	25	“ One week , ”
130103	130122	130096	130096	he	25	“ I ’ll give you one week to think things through while I fix the mess Hannah caused . ”
130129	130232	130123	130123	He	25	“ But you should know that no matter what you decide , I will never be with her . I will never give her another chance . For the rest of my life , you are the only woman I will love . I know I ’ve hurt you , Raven . I know I made you promises that I forgot about , but that will never happen again . You are my entire world , and I ’m going to do everything in my power to ensure that I ’m deserving of you , that I ’m worth coming back to . ”
130242	130249	130250	130250	I	0	“ You were always worth it , ”
130253	130303	130250	130250	I	0	“ And I will always love you . I just need to ensure that the life I ’m choosing to live is one that allows me to love myself too . Being around Hannah makes me lose sight of who I am , Ares . Ca n’t you see ? ”
130341	130347	130348	130348	he	1560	“ I will fix this , ”
130352	130364	130348	130348	he	1560	“ So come home to me in a week , okay ? ”
130473	130487	130488	130488	I	0	“ I … I did n’t know where else to g - go , ”
130562	130570	130571	130571	she	38	“ I ’m going to kill him , ”
130574	130580	130571	130571	she	38	“ Easy , Little Psycho , ”
130608	130627	130588	130588	Silas	43	“ Alanna prepared this for you the moment you called our emergency line . She even ironed it . ”
130654	130662	130663	130663	she	38	“ Tell me what happened , Rave , ”
130710	130714	130715	130715	Alanna	38	“ Get him , ”
130733	130756	130757	130757	Silas	43	“ Go get Ares Windsor for me . If Raven wo n’t tell me what happened , I ’ll make him talk . ”
130760	130784	130757	130757	Silas	43	“ It ’s not so simple , Ray . He ’s a Windsor . I ca n’t just grab him without facing consequences . ”
130785	130795	130796	130796	I	0	“ It … it was n’t h - him , ”
130816	130820	130812	130812	she	38	“ Then who ? ”
130872	130882	130883	130883	I	0	“ I ca n’t see an end to this , ”
130886	130948	130883	130883	I	0	“ Is this going to be my life now ? Marrying him was supposed to be my happily ever after , yet somehow , it feels like the beginning of the end . Forever this time . If I stay , she ’ll keep chipping away at my soul , until I end up a shell of who I once was . ”
130962	130979	130980	130980	she	38	“ Silas and I can tell you a thing or two about meddling siblings and family , ”
131007	131085	131086	131086	She	38	“ Trust me when I say that love truly does win in the end . I know that it feels hard right now , and you ’ve made the right choice by taking a step back . Being stuck in that environment makes it hard to remember why you chose to marry him in the first place , despite the odds . I think you ’ll find that some time away will give you clarity , Raven . ”
131091	131102	131086	131086	She	38	“ Can we get the articles bashing her taken down ? ”
131103	131180	131181	131181	Alanna	38	“ I was going to request it , but someone has already taken care of it . Whole servers have been taken down all around the world . The news is reporting that at least two large social media channels are completely down right now . I suspect Windsor is behind it . I ’m not sure how he ’s doing it , but it ’s clear he ’ll move heaven and earth for his wife . ”
131192	131251	131181	131181	Alanna	38	“ See ? I know it ’s hard right now , but that man loves you more than anything . I ca n’t tell you whether that ’s enough to make dealing with Hannah worth it , though . I always hated the bitch . I ’d gut her if I thought I ’d get away with it . ”
131262	131272	131181	131181	Alanna	38	“ You really are insane , are n’t you ? ”
131273	131276	131277	131277	Silas	43	“ Psychotic , ”
131381	131393	131394	131394	Sierra	22	“ I figured you ’d be here . Are you okay ? ”
131397	131416	131394	131394	Sierra	22	“ I saw the news , and then Ares told me you left . He ’s a wreck . ”
131417	131423	131424	131424	Silas	43	“ Speak of the Devil , ”
131441	131444	131445	131445	He	43	“ Windsor ? ”
131458	131529	131445	131445	He	43	“ Where is my wife ? The bodyguards I had on her told me they lost her trail . They were supposed to be the best you ’ve got , so where the fuck is she ? The entire fucking world is after her , and your men fucking lost her . If anyone so much as harms one single hair on her head , I will fucking kill you . ”
131565	131570	131562	131562	Silas	43	“ She ’s safe . ”
131575	131581	131571	131571	Ares	25	“ Is she with you ? ”
131582	131585	131562	131562	Silas	43	“ No . ”
131586	131591	131592	131592	Silas	43	“ Where is she ? ”
131633	131636	131637	131637	Silas	43	“ Yeah , ”
131641	131701	131637	131637	Silas	43	“ He ’s definitely in love with you . I have never seen him lose his cool , regardless of what situation he was put in . I once watched him foil a kidnapping attempt on Sierra without a single hint of panic crossing his face , yet you go missing for ten minutes , and his world collapses ? ”
131712	131734	131702	131702	I	0	“ All I ’ve ever wanted was his love , so should n’t that be enough ? Am I being selfish ? ”
131735	131738	131739	131739	Sierra	22	“ No , ”
131742	131849	131739	131739	Sierra	22	“ I wish it was simpler , Rave , but it is n’t just Ares you need to consider anymore . Whether we like it or not , Hannah will now always be a part of your life , of your marriage . If anything , taking some time to think about whether you can accept that is the fairest thing you can do . Is n’t that better than breaking Ares ’s heart down the line ? Especially once a child is involved . What if they become attached to you , and then you decide you ca n’t stand being around them after all ? ”
132391	132410	132384	132384	Silas	43	“ Windsor bought The Herald and several other gossip magazines . He banned them from reporting on you . ”
132475	132495	132469	132469	his	43	“ How much do you want to bet that we ’re about to find more Windsors on our doorstep ? ”
132503	132547	132496	132496	She	38	“ I ’d be disappointed if they did n’t show up , Si . Raven deserves to be part of a family that ’ll love her the way her own wo n’t . Let ’s see if the Windsors deserve her or not . ”
132556	132561	132562	132562	he	43	“ Ten paper cranes , ”
132566	132582	132562	132562	he	43	“ That ’s what you ’ll owe me if you make me host more Windsors . ”
132592	132599	132583	132583	Alanna	38	“ I ’ll give you fifteen . ”
132735	132818	132726	132726	Alanna	38	“ They were really worried about you . Each and every one of them called me , one by one . Since we ’re in charge of the Windsor family ’s security , it did n’t feel right to keep them in the dark . I did n’t tell Ares where you are , but I could n’t hide it from them . Valentina called me , in tears , and I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen her cry before . ”
132847	132851	132852	132852	Luca	41	“ You okay ? ”
132905	132963	132964	132964	I	0	“ I saw the articles . Oh , Rave , what do we do ? Should we make a statement ? Grandma Anne instructed us to keep our silence , because she ’s concerned about the baby and Hannah ’s health . But I … I do n’t know . That does n’t seem right to me . ”
132969	133059	132964	132964	I	0	“ It ’s why I left , Val . I knew I could n’t stay there without arguing with her , and I know that would threaten her and the baby ’s health . I ca n’t go back home until I ’m in a better state of mind . It ’s just that … once I go back , how long will it take before she gets to me again ? Even if she does n’t , how long will I be able to withstand the media harassment ? ”
133113	133116	133117	133117	he	34	“ Shh , ”
133120	133125	133117	133117	he	34	“ Ares is calling . ”
133134	133175	133176	133176	He	34	“ Yeah , I heard from her , and she told me she ’s fine . She ’s safe . No . I do n’t know where she is . Have n’t you instructed the security team to find her ? ”
133181	133191	133192	133192	he	34	“ How could they not have found her yet ? ”
133200	133212	133192	133192	he	34	“ Okay , well , I ’ll keep an eye out . ”
133226	133253	133213	133213	Lex	35	“ I know he promised you a week , but I do n’t think he ’ll last that long . What are you going to do ? ”
133268	133274	133275	133275	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
133280	133294	133275	133275	I	0	“ I feel like a coward for running away , for giving in . ”
133295	133298	133299	133299	Luca	41	“ Nah , ”
133307	133417	133299	133299	Luca	41	“ Let ’s normalize walking away from toxic situations . You do n’t have to stick it out when your mental health is taking a beating , just because that ’s what everyone expects of you . It ’s okay to reassess and decide whether or not a situation is still acceptable to you . You were never given a choice when it came to Ares , but you deserve one . Take your time , Raven . We ’re all here for you , and regardless of your choice , you ’ll never lose us . You will always be our little sister , just like Sierra is . ”
133433	133444	133445	133445	Sierra	22	“ Whatever you decide , we ’ll stand by you . ”
133453	133460	133461	133461	Sierra	22	“ We love you , Rave , ”
133464	133518	133461	133461	Sierra	22	“ We just want what ’s best for you , even if that is n’t Ares . I know you love my brother , but had it been me , I ’m not sure I could subject myself to the absolute bullshit you ’ll have to go through just to be with him . ”
133522	133549	133519	133519	Valentina	89	“ Sometimes , love is n’t enough . Especially when that all you ’ve got holding you together as the world tries to rip you apart . ”
133550	133553	133554	133554	Silas	43	“ Windsors , ”
133557	133567	133554	133554	Silas	43	“ You ’re going to want to see this . ”
133590	133608	133585	133585	Ares	25	“ He ’s broadcasting on all channels that the Windsors own , which is pretty much everything . ”
133634	133907	133908	133908	He	1617	“ It has come to my attention that false information is being spread by the media about my wife , so allow me to address these rumors . While I do n’t believe our private business is for you to know , I ’m well aware that you wo n’t stop the witch - hunt you ’ve created until you have the full story — and I need it to stop . I need you to stop harassing and hurting my wife . To start off , I ’d like you to know that it ’s true that Hannah Du Pont and I dated for some time . What you do n’t know , however , is that we were only together because of family obligations . The Du Ponts and the Windsor have had a marriage agreement in place for years now , agreeing to merge Windsor Media and Dreamessence , with the aim of leaving the company as a whole to be inherited by children resulting from this marriage . With Hannah and I being closest in age , we seemed like the best fit , and we did everything in our power to make it work . I tried my hardest to love her , but I could never escape my feelings for my wife . In this time , I never crossed the line with Raven . Unlike what the media is reporting , there were no affairs , not even close . For years , Raven and I were nothing but friends . Until Hannah chose to walk away from the engagement our families had decided on . ”
133918	134092	133908	133908	He	1617	“ Raven is the love of my life , and walking away from our relationship is the single best thing Hannah ever could have done for me . Hannah was n’t wronged — she left . My wife is not a home wrecker , nor is she the seductress so many have claimed she is . She ’s just a woman who loves her family more than they deserve . She loves me more than I deserve , and for as long as I live , I ’ll love her in return . So here I am , just a man who loves his wife more than anything , asking you to stop this witch - hunt . I beg of you , stop harassing her , stop damaging the designs she spent many sleepless nights over , stop spreading rumors . The only mistake she has ever made was loving a man that does n’t deserve her , and for my sake , I hope she ’ll never want to remedy it . ”
134100	134248	134249	134249	He	1618	“ Now that you have the truth , any lies being spread about my wife will be deemed slander . Those of you who wo n’t heed my warning will face legal action . Any slander we find circulating twenty - four hours from now will be reported , and we ’ll leave our legal team to deal with that . I ask that you think carefully about the words you spread . Celebrities like my wife are still human , too . My wife , in particular , is the most soft - hearted person I know . Every single one of your words , she takes to heart . Do you want to be responsible for a woman crying herself to sleep , when the gossip you ’re so happily sharing is n’t true ? Please , I ask you to do the right thing . ”
134253	134267	134249	134249	He	1618	“ And Raven ? I love you , Cupcake . No matter what . ”
134425	134428	134429	134429	Alanna	38	“ Raven , ”

134520	134555	134510	134510	He	25	“ You ’re not walking out of this house unless you choose to . I wo n’t let him pressure you . You take all the time you need to make up your mind . ”
134568	134571	134572	134572	he	41	“ Agreed , ”
134619	134630	134631	134631	I	0	“ I ’m not sure calling the police was warranted , ”
134642	134662	134637	134637	his	41	“ Of course it was . There ’s no way Ares would leave otherwise , and you ’d cave . ”

134842	134860	134839	134839	she	38	“ This is exactly the kind of thing you would do . I think it ’s cute . ”

134960	134992	134957	134957	Valentina	89	“ I mean , you asked for a week , and he gave it to you . Ca n’t blame the man for showing up the second your time is up . ”
135006	135014	135001	135001	his	41	“ How do you feel , Rave ? ”
135020	135119	135001	135001	his	41	“ You know what ? I think I ’m ready to go home to my husband . Being in the midst of it made it hard to see , but the good still outweighs the bad . It always will . The first few years might be tough , but I think I can bear with it if it means spending the rest of my life with the man of my dreams . I ’m terrified , and I ’m well aware it wo n’t be easy , but it ’s worth it . He ’s worth it . ”
135133	135137	135138	135138	he	41	“ Thank God , ”
135141	135152	135138	135138	he	41	“ I do n’t think he ’d survive losing you . ”

135192	135218	135189	135189	Silas	43	“ He used the banner to draw us out onto the balcony . He wanted to know if you were here . Clever fucking asshole . ”
135287	135296	135278	135278	Silas	43	“ Your mind is made up , huh ? ”
135300	135304	135278	135278	Silas	43	“ It is . ”
135305	135366	135278	135278	Silas	43	“ I ’ll be honest with you , Raven . I wish you ’d reconsider . My brother and I get on well now , but for some time , I had to cut him out of our lives . If I had n’t done that , he never would ’ve learned his lesson . Your sister wo n’t either . ”
135367	135371	135372	135372	I	0	“ I know , ”
135376	135414	135372	135372	I	0	“ But it ’s different when I choose to endure her . Maybe it ’s crazy , but I think I ’m going to be okay , because I ’m stepping back into the madness by choice . ”
135441	135446	135430	135430	he	25	“ Well , shit , ”
135475	135483	135484	135484	Ares	25	“ I ’ll deal with you later , ”

135564	135804	135546	135546	he	25	“ One single week without you was enough for me to know that I can not spend a lifetime without you by my side . My life is n’t worth living if you ’re not in it . I fucked up , baby . I can see that now . I never should ’ve allowed Hannah access to you , and instead of obeying Grandma ’s orders , I should ’ve taken you away from home . I swear to you , I cut all ties with Hannah . I ’ve ensured that all communication runs through Grandma , regardless of what it ’s about . I ’ve put an entire team in place to assist her , and I ’ve assigned her a full - time doctor , so you do n’t need to worry about your sister ’s health . I told her that it was a take it or leave it deal , and that whether or not I ’d be in the child ’s life depended entirely on her . Everything related to the baby and her will go through our dedicated team . We ’ll handle all of this on our terms , and the only times we ’ll see her is when you want to . It is n’t enough , and I know it is n’t , but it ’s a start . Everything else , I know we can figure out . ”
135815	135916	135805	135805	He	1651	“ I know I ’m selfish , but I ca n’t help myself . I ’ve loved you for as long as I can remember , Raven , and I always will . I wish I could promise you the carefree life that I want to give you , but being with me wo n’t be easy . What I can promise you is that I ’ll always put you first , and I will do everything in my power to ensure you ’ll never regret choosing me . So choose me , Raven . Please come home to me . ”

I allowed my self doubt and insecurities to swallow me whole , and I struggled to see through the darkness . It wo n’t happen again . I choose you , Ares . I will always choose you , even if it is n’t an easy choice to make . Just a few days without you have shown me that I ’d rather suffer with you than live a life without you . ”
136062	136070	136071	136071	he	1653	“ I wo n’t let you suffer , ”
136075	136113	136071	136071	he	1653	“ Being with me wo n’t come at a price , I promise . It might be hard to believe right now , but trust me when I tell you that everything is going to be okay . ”

136303	136306	136307	136307	she	24	“ Ares , ”
136348	136351	136352	136352	I	0	“ Congratulations , ”
136356	136386	136352	136352	I	0	“ The doctor told me you ’re in the clear , and the baby is doing well . Looks like a change of scenery is exactly what you needed . ”
136390	136426	136387	136387	She	24	“ Yeah . I love this place . It ’s much better than your place . We ’ll have to renovate that . It is n’t child - friendly , and I hate the interior . ”
136440	136469	136470	136470	She	24	“ Yeah , we ’re not doing that . Raven put a lot of love into our home , and it ’s staying exactly the way it is . ”
136475	136521	136472	136472	her	24	“ I wo n’t let you see our daughter if the environment you ’re taking her to is n’t safe for her . I already have reservations about leaving her around Raven . What if she stages some kind of accident and hurts our baby ? ”
136549	136572	136573	136573	She	24	“ Is she ? Is she mine ? I ’ve asked you this before , but I need the truth , Hannah . ”
136585	136603	136573	136573	She	24	“ Of course she is . Is this Raven again ? Did you speak to her recently ? ”
136612	136624	136625	136625	I	0	“ Keep my wife ’s name out of your filthy mouth , ”
136630	136637	136625	136625	I	0	“ And explain this to me . ”
136653	136712	136648	136648	she	24	“ It ’s a prenatal paternity test . Some of those blood tests the doctor did ? Yeah , they were n’t all regular tests . We conducted a fetal cell analysis , comparing the genetic profile of the fetal cells in your bloodstream to mine . It was n’t a match . I ’m not the father . ”
136721	136735	136713	136713	I	0	“ But then again , you already knew that , did n’t you ? ”
136781	136818	136819	136819	Hannah	26	“ Sincerely apologize to Raven , and I ’ll let you get away with everything you put her through if she asks me to — and she will , because despite everything , she loves you . ”
136822	136874	136819	136819	Hannah	26	“ Why would I do that ? I have n’t done anything to her . She ’s the one who decided to run off because she could n’t take the media ’s pressure . I would never have done that to you . I ’d have weathered any storm with you . ”
136882	137043	136877	136877	my	0	“ She was willing to help me raise a child that is n’t hers , Hannah . Her leaving had nothing to do with me — it had everything to do with you . I would never ask my wife to settle for less than she deserves , but this was n’t about her not wanting to weather storms with me . It was about her refusing to be torn down by her own sister for the rest of her life . It was her taking away the power you thought you had over her , and taking some time to think about what her boundaries are . I , for one , respect the hell out of her for being able to do what so many of us wo n’t . I know I stuck around for far longer than I ever should have just because I thought it was the right thing to do , have n’t you ? ”
137052	137061	137049	137049	her	1658	“ I truly do love you , Ares . ”
137071	137098	137065	137065	I	0	“ Hannah , you do n’t love anyone but yourself . And I ? I do n’t think I ever truly loved you at all either . ”
137125	137143	137144	137144	She	1658	“ If you wo n’t apologize to Raven , then do n’t blame me for the consequences . ”
137153	137158	137159	137159	she	1658	“ I wo n’t , ”
137211	137214	137215	137215	I	0	“ Fine , ”
137294	137316	137317	137317	I	0	“ Did you truly believe I did n’t know about the affairs ? The men you ’d cheat with on set ? ”
137320	137332	137333	137333	I	0	“ I knew . I just did n’t give a fuck . ”
137341	137368	137335	137335	my	0	“ I hope you enjoy the experience you gave your sister . Perhaps now , for once , you might understand what you put her through . ”
137375	137500	137335	137335	my	0	“ Oh , and Hannah ? You will never work in the entertainment industry again . Anyone who so much as attempts to hire you is going to pay the price . I want you out of my wife ’s sight — I do n’t want her to see a single commercial , no video coverage , nothing . I ’m pulling every movie I funded for you from every channel it ’s streaming on . I do n’t want her faced with even one single reminder of everything you put her through . You can disappear quietly , or I can make it happen forcibly . For the sake of the child you ’re carrying , I suggest you think before you act . ”
137501	137504	137505	137505	she	1662	“ Ares ! ”
137804	137808	137809	137809	I	0	“ Mrs. Windsor . ”
137826	137861	137809	137809	I	0	“ Your mother is here to see you . Mr. Windsor instructed us not to let any of your family members in without your express permission . What would you like me to do ? ”
137870	137875	137862	137862	I	0	“ Send her in . ”
137925	137928	137929	137929	Mom	32	“ Raven , ”
137992	138002	138003	138003	She	32	“ What can I do for you , Mom ? ”
138013	138049	138003	138003	She	32	“ How could you be sitting here so quietly when there are countless rumors circulating about your sister ? I ca n’t leave Dreamessence to you if you ca n’t even handle a PR crisis . ”
138059	138116	138050	138050	I	0	“ And what exactly did you do to handle the PR crisis I experienced just two weeks ago ? You did n’t even call me to check if I was okay . Did you know Dad tried hiring Silas Sinclair to find and protect me when he could n’t reach me ? What did you do ? ”
138126	138148	138149	138149	I	0	“ Well , it was hardly a crisis . I knew you had Ares to help you take care of it . ”
138156	138204	138149	138149	I	0	“ I was getting dead threats . People were burning my designs on the streets , calling me a home wrecker , declaring they could never support a woman like me . All of that , and you did n’t even think to check up on me ? ”
138209	138242	138205	138205	Mom	32	“ You made it through just fine , did n’t you ? Since you were able to dispel the drama , you should be able to do the same for your sister . ”
138248	138267	138243	138243	I	0	“ Why would I , when it ’s my husband who created this scandal in the first place ? ”
138268	138271	138123	138123	her	32	“ What ? ”
138272	138296	138297	138297	I	0	“ If you ’re just here for Hannah , I ’ll need to ask you to leave . I wo n’t help her . ”
138303	138417	138297	138297	I	0	“ And if you want to remain in my life , you ’ll need to respect that . You have your moments , Mom , but for the most part , you ’ve never really been a mother to me . Your only concern has always been Hannah , and I ’m tired of it . I do n’t need you to prioritize me , mother . But I do need you to stop tearing me down in favor of her . I ’m tired of the constant comparison , the snide remarks . If we ’re going to have any kind of relationship at all , it ’ll be on my terms . ”
138426	138452	138418	138418	She	1675	“ What has gotten into you , Raven ? I know you ’ve always been jealous of your sister , but you ’re being unreasonable . ”
138460	138496	138453	138453	I	0	“ It ’s clear you heard me speak , yet you ’re not listening . Maybe you will , someday , but I ’m not going to sit around and wait for a moment longer . ”
138517	138533	138505	138505	Ben	90	“ Please see my mother out . Deny her access to my home going forward . ”
138534	138537	138538	138538	she	1677	“ Raven ! ”
138541	138571	138538	138538	she	1677	“ Have you completely lost your mind ? If you ’re going to continue acting this way , I wo n’t give you the shares I hold in Dreamessence . ”
138581	138634	138572	138572	I	0	“ I do n’t need them . I never had any interest in your company , Mom . And let ’s be real . You never wanted me to inherit it in the first place . This is just another excuse to give Hannah the company . She ’s welcome to it . ”
138640	138674	138635	138635	I	0	“ I suppose that does mean Ares will walk away from the merger , but so be it . Anything for your precious daughter , huh ? Good luck to both of you . ”
138748	138757	138744	138744	she	1677	“ I ’m proud of you , Cupcake . ”
138810	138826	138797	138797	he	25	“ There ’s somewhere I want to take you today . Will you let me ? ”
138832	138850	138827	138827	I	0	“ Surely by now you know that I ’ll follow you to the ends of the world ? ”
138864	138871	138872	138872	he	25	“ I ’m counting on it , ”
138931	138936	138937	138937	she	24	“ Are you okay ? ”
138945	138951	138937	138937	she	24	“ You ’re so quiet . ”
138968	138974	138975	138975	Raven	24	“ Where are we going ? ”
138986	138991	138981	138981	I	0	“ You ’ll see . ”
139084	139087	139088	139088	Raven	24	“ Wow ! ”
139128	139132	139133	139133	I	0	“ Come on , ”
139216	139223	139208	139208	Raven	24	“ What is this , Ares ? ”
139284	139287	139288	139288	I	0	“ Raven , ”
139292	139317	139288	139288	I	0	“ I wanted to take you back to the place where it all started , because there ’s something I need to ask you . ”
139356	139549	139349	139349	I	0	“ Raven Windsor , you are the love of my life . If you were to ask me when I fell in love with you , I ’m not sure I could answer … because the truth is that I ca n’t remember a time when I did n’t love you . All I can tell you is that with each passing day , I love you more . You are the best thing that has ever happened to me , the light of my life , my favorite part of every day . You are the woman of my dreams , the one I thought got away . I wish I could go back in time and right the wrongs we ’ve endured , but I ca n’t , baby . All I can do is promise you that I will make up for the time we lost , each and every single day we spend together . If you let me , I will do everything in my power to protect your smile , to bring you happiness . There is nothing I wo n’t do for you , Raven . ”
139559	139646	139550	139550	I	0	“ When you and I got married , there ’s a lot we missed out on . There ’s a lot you did n’t get to experience , so let ’s start over , my love . I want you to have everything you deserve , everything we would ’ve had . So here , in the place where we shared our first kiss , I ’d like to ask you again … Raven , will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me ? ”
139676	139707	139673	139673	she	24	“ Yes , Ares . I ’ll marry you . If I could do it all over again , I ’d still choose you . I will always choose you . ”
139752	139824	139739	139739	I	0	“ I love you , Raven . Let ’s do it all over again . Let ’s start at the beginning . I want you in a wedding dress of your own choosing , in a venue we both love , surrounded by people we actually care about . I want a wedding that ’s all about us , and not about our obligations or our families . I want you . ”
139837	139851	139825	139825	She	281	“ You really are my every dream come true , you know that ? ”
139867	139873	139874	139874	she	281	“ How did you know ? ”
139877	139885	139874	139874	she	281	“ This is exactly what I wanted . ”
139897	139943	139944	139944	She	281	“ Do you remember that day I asked you to come shopping with me , and I took you to a jewelry store ? You were glancing at rings for a moment or two , your eyes lingering on a ring similar to this one . ”
139963	140049	139944	139944	She	281	“ I called Laurier a day later and requested that he make this ring . I wanted something reminiscent of the ring you loved in that store , but I wanted something no one else in this world would have . It was stupid , because back then there was no way I could give it to you , but I had to have it . I do n’t know … maybe a small part of me knew that someday , we ’d be together . ”
140050	140054	140055	140055	she	281	“ That day , ”
140058	140080	140055	140055	she	281	“ When I saw that ring , I remember thinking to myself that I could n’t imagine marrying anyone but you . ”
140092	140099	140100	140100	I	0	“ We lost so much time , ”
140137	140142	140143	140143	she	281	“ Maybe we did , ”
140146	140257	140143	140143	she	281	“ but maybe this is for the best . We both had time to grow , to become better versions of ourselves than we would have been when we were young . Our lives shaped us , Ares , and while I ’d do anything to have had those moments with you , to erase some of the memories I have of you … part of me is also grateful that we ’re standing here together as the people we are today . I ’m grateful for every lesson , every twist and turn our lives took , because in the end , it all led me back to you . ”
140266	140270	140271	140271	I	0	“ It did , ”
140283	140293	140271	140271	I	0	“ And I will never let you go again . ”
140435	140438	140439	140439	she	281	“ Ares , ”
140469	140472	140473	140473	I	0	“ Baby , ”
140476	140511	140512	140512	She	281	“ You look far too fucking beautiful in this . I ca n’t take this . I can already imagine what all your pervs will have to say about the photos of this show . ”
140515	140525	140526	140526	she	281	“ It ’s the last one , my love , ”
140529	140560	140526	140526	she	281	“ This will be the last show I walk as a professional model . Going forward , I ’ll only model for my own brand whenever I feel like it . ”
140561	140592	140593	140593	She	281	“ It ’s only fitting that the last show you walk is also your own first fashion show . One door is closing , but another is opening for you . ”
140596	140610	140593	140593	She	281	“ I thought it would be nice symbolism , do n’t you think ? ”
140622	140652	140611	140611	She	281	“ Though , I will say … I ’ll miss Iwanttolickravensknee ’s comments on my photos . I wonder what he ’ll have to say about this final show . ”
140660	140682	140653	140653	I	0	“ I have it on good authority that he ’s obsessed with you and will continue to DM you perverted shit . ”
140683	140688	140689	140689	She	281	“ Is that so ? ”
140692	140702	140689	140689	She	281	“ Maybe I should start giving him private shows . ”
140706	140715	140703	140703	I	0	“ I really think he ’d like that . ”
140728	140746	140716	140716	I	0	“ Moment of honesty … I ’ve always hated the way everyone looks at you on stage . ”
140761	140789	140747	140747	I	0	“ I never interfered because I have the utmost respect for you , my love , but I always wanted everyone to know that you ’re mine . ”
140802	140822	140790	140790	She	281	“ I ’m relatively certain that my wedding ring is visible even to those sitting in the back rows . ”
140841	140849	140826	140826	I	0	“ It ’s not enough , Cupcake . ”
140864	140885	140850	140850	I	0	“ As every man stares at you , I want to make sure that your thoughts are only on me . ”
140899	140905	140906	140906	I	0	“ No fucking panties again , ”

141053	141101	141044	141044	I	0	“ I ’m going to fuck you so hard that you ’ll still be feeling my cock when you walk down that catwalk . The whole world is going to want you , but with every step , you ’ll be reminded of who you belong to . ”
141115	141164	141102	141102	I	0	“ Look at you , baby . You ’re such a fucking slut , my love . You ’re smiling so happily as you take my cock in your dressing room . Anyone could walk in at any moment , but you do n’t care , do you ? ”
141181	141186	141187	141187	she	281	“ Do n’t stop , ”

141319	141344	141345	141345	She	281	“ I do n’t want to hear a single complaint about your pussy being sore later . Remember , you ’re asking for it . ”
141360	141366	141367	141367	she	281	“ Give it to me , ”
