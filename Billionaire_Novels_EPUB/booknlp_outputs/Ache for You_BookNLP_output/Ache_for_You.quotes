17722	17737	17738	17738	He	96	“ From what I understand , she comes from a titled but impoverished background . ”
17744	17793	17794	17794	He	96	“ You know how it is in Europe , tesoro . There are as many destitute barons and counts as there are churches . Many of the old aristocratic families lost their fortunes , but no matter how poor you become , you get to keep the title . ”
17798	17809	17794	17794	He	96	“ It impresses people who do n’t know any better . ”

18236	18243	18244	18244	He	107	“ But it ’s my pleasure . ”

18860	18891	18857	18857	he	107	“ The marchesa does not share her feelings with her servants . And — forgive me — even if she did , I would n’t share them with anyone else . ”
19038	19062	19035	19035	Lorenzo	107	“ I apologize if what I said angered you , signorina . It was n’t my intention to be disrespectful , only honest . ”
19157	19163	19164	19164	I	0	“ I appreciate your honesty , ”
19181	19197	19164	19164	I	0	“ And I ’m sure you can appreciate how I might not be myself today . ”

The big one ’s tall enough that it does n’t need a chair , it just sits on the floor and gobbles its food right off the plate , but the tiny evil one has a booster seat like they give kids at restaurants — only it ’s made of silk . ”

21663	21687	21688	21688	He	725	“ You tell me alarmingly often , darling . For such a sharp , ball - busting businesswoman , you ’re awfully mushy . ”

23380	23440	23367	23368	The attorney	726	“ In regard to your father ’s business , DiSanto Couture has an excellent reputation for quality . However , based on a review of the books , it ’s operating at a loss . It ’s not sustainable at current levels of income versus debt , so the obvious course of action is to bring in a buyer . ”
23449	23465	23441	23442	Signor Rossi	117	“ Unless you ’d like to try to take it over and turn it around . ”
23466	23485	23486	23486	He	726	“ No . I ’m not staying here . I ’ve got to get back to the States . ”
23489	23531	23532	23533	The marchesa	2402	“ We ’ll find a buyer . I recommend going through the inventory and repricing it to more competitive levels in order to boost the selling price . From what I can see , there ’s substantial room for improvement there . ”

23974	24013	24048	24048	her	773	“ Under the terms of your lease , you ’re responsible for your rent until you ’ve been cleared of any liability . I have no idea how long it ’ll take the authorities to determine what happened , so”—he

All I had to say was ‘ Beautiful American , ’ and they connected me to your room straightaway . Speaking of rooms , the lady in four - twelve was very nice , but I prefer my women to have their real teeth and be able to walk without a cane . ”
26057	26079	26053	26053	I	0	“ Really ? I ’d have thought as long as a woman was breathing , you ’d be good to go . ”

27296	27331	27340	27340	she	2402	“ It was before that . Brad did n’t know Papa was sick . I did n’t know Papa was sick . I got Dominic ’s letter a few days after we broke up . ”

28271	28301	28306	28306	I	0	“ So you do n’t think it was a fair trade ? You ’d rather have your sketch pad back than to have seen your father before he died ? ”
28319	28326	28316	28316	I	0	“ You son of a bitch . ”
28341	28361	28327	28328	The marchesa	2402	“ I do n’t quite understand what ’s happening , but let ’s all calm down , shall we ? ”
28362	28384	28385	28385	I	0	“ Lady , I ’m so far from calm I ’d have to send out a search party to find it . ”

28450	28474	28446	28446	I	0	“ It ’s a pretty crafty way to get your hands on some of Papa ’s money , I ’ll give you that . ”
28490	28536	28537	28537	She	2402	“ I would never have mentioned the sale to Matteo if he were n’t capable of handling the business and honoring Luca ’s artistic vision . The House of Moretti is among the most respected ateliers in fashion . Perhaps you ’ve heard of it ? ”
28587	28595	28596	28596	Matteo	108	“ Ca n’t say that I have . ”
28651	28660	28661	28661	I	0	“ Not that you ’d care to know , ”
28677	28690	28661	28661	I	0	“ but my father ’s last words to me were about you . ”
28720	28772	28713	28713	I	0	“ And he gave me a piece of advice I did n’t realize would come in handy so soon . He told me not to give up when things get difficult . His exact words were ‘ Dig in your heels . ’ So this is me digging in my heels . ”

28877	28905	28873	28873	I	0	“ Oh , wait . I think I have heard of you — didn’t I read somewhere that the House of Moretti recently lost its head designer ? ”
28921	28928	28917	28917	He	108	“ I am the head designer . ”
28970	29012	29013	29014	The marchesa	2402	“ Not really hands on , though , I ’d guess . I ca n’t picture you with rolled - up sleeves , pinning cloth on mannequins , working deep into the night . Probably too busy running around with supermodels . ”
29017	29025	29013	29014	The marchesa	2402	“ My son does n’t date models . ”
29035	29047	29033	29033	her	2402	“ Do you pick out his underwear for him , too ? ”
29051	29057	29048	29048	Matteo	108	“ Stop with the disrespect ! ”
29062	29100	29101	29101	My	0	“ Do n’t you dare talk to me about disrespect ! Your precious mother did n’t have enough respect for my father to visit him in the hospital while he was dying , did you know that ? ”

29247	29256	29241	29241	He	108	“ And your attitude , and your selfishness — ”
29262	29266	29257	29257	I	0	“ My selfishness ? ”
29267	29273	29274	29274	he	108	“ And your bad manners ! ”
29277	29299	29274	29274	he	108	“ Did it ever occur to you that not everyone wants the whole world to know when they ’re in pain ? ”
29381	29421	29374	29374	I	0	“ I ’m sorry my grief is so offensive to you . I have this thing called a heart . I ’m not the kind of person who ’s able to pretend everything is fine when it ’s bleeding . ”
29442	29445	29430	29430	he	108	“ Wait . ”
29446	29453	29454	29454	I	0	“ Get your hands off me . ”

29807	29813	29814	29814	He	108	“ What an interesting development . ”

30153	30187	30188	30188	He	108	“ That ’s right . He humiliated me completely . But he did it because he ’s immature . You just did it because it made you feel good . Which is worse ? ”
30249	30260	30245	30245	He	108	“ You ca n’t be serious about keeping the company . ”
30268	30274	30261	30261	I	0	“ And why is that ? ”
30298	30328	30295	30295	I	0	“ If you ’re about to make a nasty comment about my gender , my brains , or my style , I ’m about to neuter your smug ass . ”

30363	30371	30446	30446	He	108	“ What is it with your arrogance ? ”
30372	30385	30446	30446	He	108	“ There ’s a big difference between self - confidence and arrogance . ”
30386	30419	30339	30339	Him	108	“ Yeah , there is , and any man who propositions a woman in an airport lounge after a thirty - second conversation lands squarely on the arrogance side of that equation . ”
30420	30433	30446	30446	He	108	“ I did n’t proposition you . I said I wanted you . ”
30434	30445	30446	30446	He	108	“ You ’re splitting hairs . The intent was clear . ”
30454	30468	30446	30446	He	108	“ You think I do that all the time , is that it ? ”
30469	30481	30446	30446	He	108	“ I honestly do n’t care one way or the other . ”
30482	30505	30506	30506	He	108	“ You ’ll have to learn to lie better than that if you ’re going to succeed in fashion here , bella . ”

30605	30634	30595	30595	He	108	“ And a girl from San Francisco — not even New York — who owns a sweet little dress shop is in no way prepared to compete here . ”
30635	30681	30682	30682	His	108	“ Wow . I ’m not sure which was worse : the sexism in that statement , or the sheer snobbism . I ’m insulted on behalf of my gender and my country . And how do you know so much about me , anyway ? ”

32959	32992	32904	32904	I	0	“ My God , Poppins , he ’s the most beautiful man who ever lived . Did you see the spread of him in Italian GQ when he first launched his company ? ”
32993	33027	33028	33028	Jenner	58	“ No . I ’d never seen a picture of him before . I had no idea what he looked like , which is why I did n’t recognize him at the airport ! ”
33038	33058	33028	33028	Jenner	58	“ Matteo . Oh , my dear sweet Matteo . J’taime . J’adore . Tu es tout pour moi — ”

33079	33102	33103	33103	I	0	“ Can we get this train back on track ? My point of this story is that I ’m moving to Florence ! ”
33176	33179	33180	33180	he	58	“ Darling , ”
33184	33231	33180	33180	he	58	“ it ’s best not to make such huge life decisions when you ’re grieving . Moving to another country on a whim is n’t like you . You ’re dependable . Reliable . Grounded . What you need right now is therapy , not Italy . ”
33232	33246	33251	33251	He	58	“ Give me one reason why I should come back to the States . ”

33392	33405	33389	33389	Jenner	58	“ No . The universe ca n’t possibly hate you that much . ”
33424	33532	33406	33406	I	0	“ Apparently the universe has put me at the top of its most - hated list . I got a call from my landlord yesterday . The shop went up in flames , along with everything in it . My entire life there is gone . Even if I did come back , what would I return to ? All that ’s left is an apartment that is n’t mine and a reputation as Bradley Wingate ’s sloppy seconds . Who ’d want me ? I ’ll always be the girl who was dumped at the altar . I ’ll never be able to live that down . ”
33544	33562	33540	33540	Jenner	58	“ I suppose this is as good a time as any to tell you I saw him . ”
33579	33584	33540	33540	Jenner	58	“ When ? How ? ”
33585	33606	33607	33607	I	0	“ He came to my apartment . I made the mistake of opening the door without asking who it was . ”
33625	33631	33607	33607	I	0	“ What did he want ? ”
33632	33638	33540	33540	Jenner	58	“ To talk to you . ”
33646	33653	33643	33643	I	0	“ What are you leaving out ? ”
33658	33682	33654	33654	He	58	“ I debated whether I should tell you this , but he looked wrecked . Like he had n’t slept since the wedding . ”
33683	33687	33688	33688	I	0	“ The nonwedding , ”
33706	33714	33696	33696	Brad	60	“ And good , I ’m glad ! ”
33729	33733	33721	33721	I	0	“ What else ? ”
33734	33738	33739	33739	I	0	“ He cried . ”
33761	33778	33739	33739	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , I thought I just heard you tell me that Brad cried . ”
33779	33783	33784	33784	I	0	“ I did . ”
33787	33833	33784	33784	I	0	“ Brad does n’t cry ! I do n’t think he even owns tear ducts ! He yawned through his grandmother ’s funeral ! When the family dog got hit by a car , Brad suggested his mother turn it into mulch for her roses ! ”
33834	33896	33739	33739	I	0	“ Well , darling , unless the man recently took up method acting , these tears were bona fide . He sat on my sofa and sobbed like a baby . When I told him your father had died , I thought he ’d pass out . He even tried to hug me when he left , if you can imagine . ”
33930	33958	33784	33784	I	0	“ Why would you tell him about my father ? Why would you tell that asshole anything ? Why would you even let him through your door ? ”
33959	34021	34065	34065	Jenner	58	“ Because the first thing out of his mouth was that he knew he cocked the whole thing up . And the second thing out of his mouth was that he was the biggest idiot on the planet and did n’t deserve you . Since we were in such agreement about the basics , I thought I ’d hear him out . ”
34022	34030	34031	34031	I	0	“ He left me at the altar ! ”
34041	34056	34031	34031	I	0	“ He humiliated me ! I hate his guts and wish he was dead ! ”
34057	34063	34065	34065	Jenner	58	“ Except you do n’t , ”
34086	34138	34083	34083	Jenner	58	“ Do you remember what you said when I told you that I ’d never seen you so happy after you and Brad started dating ? You said , ‘ Every time I look at him , I feel like it ’s the first time I ’ve seen the sun . ’ ”
34139	34145	34146	34146	I	0	“ I was a fool , ”
34160	34169	34146	34146	I	0	“ Maybe . And maybe so was he . ”
34182	34273	34177	34177	Jenner	58	“ I ’m not saying give him a second chance . I know it ’s beyond that . I ’m saying maybe just . . . listen to what he has to say . For your own peace of mind . For closure , if nothing else . If he really did n’t care about your feelings , he never would ’ve sat there and let me vomit my disdain all over him . He took it for half an hour , darling , nodding and crying the entire time . ”
34324	34414	34321	34321	he	925	“ I ca n’t deal with this shit right now . I ’ve got a wicked stepmother , canine stepsisters , and an arrogant , infuriating stepbrother I ’d like to do all kinds of dirty things with . I ’ve got my father ’s funeral to attend , his business to salvage , and my former life to kiss goodbye . I ’ve got no money and nowhere to live except under the same roof as the woman who refused to visit my father when he was dying . ”
34421	34504	34321	34321	he	925	“ I am not living my best life right now , okay ? The last thing I need to hear about is fucking Brad and his fucking regrets . If you see him again , tell him that if he really wants to make it up to me , he can slice off his balls , put them in a blender , and live stream it on the internet ! Then maybe he ’ll start to have an idea how I feel ! ”
34691	34697	34699	34699	Dominic	96	“ You ’re quiet today , ”
34826	34836	34837	34837	I	0	“ It ’s exactly the same as I remember , ”
34864	34895	34896	34896	He	96	“ Your father recently hired helpers , three ladies he trained to take orders and measurements , cut the cloth . The sewing he always did himself , of course . ”
34912	34920	34921	34921	He	96	“ Still no answering machine , though . ”
34928	34932	34921	34921	He	96	“ Or computer . ”
34933	34953	34954	34954	Dominic	96	“ Or website . It ’s like he did n’t believe the twenty - first century was a thing . ”
34957	34991	34954	34954	Dominic	96	“ He only got an email address so he could communicate with you . If they did n’t have computers for public use at the library , he would ’ve kept sending letters . ”
35059	35066	35054	35054	I	0	“ No wonder he was broke . ”
35110	35126	35127	35127	Dominic	96	“ I offered many times to assist , but you know how stubborn he was . ”
35173	35199	35160	35160	I	0	“ Okay . First I ’ve got to go through the inventory and reprice everything . Then we need to look at the advertising budget — ”
35200	35203	35204	35204	Dominic	96	“ Advertising ? ”
35207	35222	35204	35204	Dominic	96	“ Do n’t tell me he was still relying only on word of mouth ? ”
35228	35236	35223	35223	Dominic	96	“ Old dog . No new tricks . ”
35255	35294	35295	35295	Dominic	96	“ Can you drop my luggage off at the house for me ? I ’m not sure how late I ’ll get back , and it ’ll be easier for me to come in without all my stuff . ”
35301	35310	35295	35295	Dominic	96	“ You ’re not moving to another hotel ? ”
35311	35322	35323	35323	His	96	“ Nope . I ’m moving in with the marchesa . ”
35333	35366	35328	35328	I	0	“ It ’s a long story . The bottom line is that I ’ve decided I ’m not selling Papa ’s business . I ’m going to stay here and run it . ”

35873	35890	35891	35891	He	96	“ Do n’t flatter yourself . And while you ’re busy not flattering yourself , leave . ”

36572	36580	36581	36581	I	0	“ This shop will never be yours , ”
36607	36615	36604	36604	I	0	“ Neither will anything else of mine . ”
36623	36628	36620	36620	Matteo	108	“ We ’ll see . ”
36693	36696	36679	36679	I	0	“ Out . ”
36742	36759	36727	36727	He	108	“ I wonder what Luca would think to hear the way his daughter speaks to me . ”
36888	36903	36883	36883	I	0	“ Will you please excuse us ? Matteo and I need to talk privately . ”
36925	36938	36919	36919	He	96	“ I can tell you do n’t like him . Smart girl . ”
36970	36977	36965	36965	I	0	“ I owe you an apology . ”
37047	37065	37037	37037	I	0	“ For how I talk to you . I ’m normally not this . . . ragey . ”
37078	37090	37075	37075	he	108	“ You ’re hurting . I ’m just a convenient target . ”
37185	37223	37224	37224	I	0	“ I suppose you ’re right . The sketch pad situation did n’t help , but it was more than a fair trade . That plane ticket is probably the best gift I ’ve ever been given . ”
37271	37276	37277	37277	he	108	“ I envy you , ”
37308	37314	37315	37315	He	108	“ What do you mean ? ”
37356	37366	37367	37367	His	108	“ My father died when I was very young . ”
37398	37413	37414	37414	He	108	“ At least you knew him . My mother died when I was born . ”
37467	37478	37480	37480	Matteo	108	“ Your father showed me a picture of her once , ”
37504	37512	37488	37488	he	108	“ You look so much like her . ”
37531	37576	37577	37577	Matteo	108	“ I know . I mean , from all the photographs I ’ve seen , we ’re like twins . As I got older , sometimes I ’d catch Papa staring at me with this haunted look , like he was seeing a ghost . ”
37594	37617	37577	37577	Matteo	108	“ Do you think that ’s why the only pictures of you in the house are from when you were a child ? ”
37702	37721	37677	37677	he	100	“ Hair as black as night . Skin as white as snow . Lips as red as blood . ”
37732	37760	37729	37729	Matteo	108	“ That ’s how your father described you . Like Snow White , he said , only too smart to take a poison apple from a witch . ”
37816	37850	37851	37851	He	108	“ If there ’s one thing fairy tales have taught me , it ’s that the most tempting , perfect - looking apples are always the ones that are rotten to the core . ”
37871	37898	37859	37859	His	108	“ Question : How much of your dislike of me is actually about me , and how much of it is about your ex - fiancé ? ”
37966	37976	37955	37955	He	108	“ My ex has nothing to do with anything . ”
37977	37980	37981	37981	His	108	“ Really ? ”
37990	38051	37981	37981	His	108	“ Because I ’m starting to think you decided to hate me before we ever spoke a word to each other . I ’m starting to think that look of disgust you gave me at the airport lounge when you first saw me had nothing to do with me and everything to do with you getting dumped at the altar . ”
38085	38096	38064	38064	Wolverine	141	“ I never said I was dumped at the altar . ”
38122	38140	38104	38104	I	0	“ You did n’t have to . There are plenty of stories about it on the internet . ”
38153	38158	38146	38146	I	0	“ You googled me ? ”
38168	38217	38159	38159	His	108	“ I like to know all there is to know about my business rivals . ‘ The Lovelorn Seamstress ’ ? ‘ The Cast - Away Couturier ’ ? So many clever headlines . Maybe you can use one of them for the name of your new shop . ”
38290	38346	38281	38281	I	0	“ Maybe I did decide to hate you before we spoke a word to each other , and maybe I had good reasons . The way you walk around like the world should throw itself at your feet . The way you smirk at everyone , so superior . The way you look at women — ”
38347	38350	38351	38351	he	998	“ You , ”
38358	38369	38351	38351	he	998	“ The way I look at you , you mean . ”
38370	38395	38354	38354	his	998	“ You ’re splitting hairs again . I ’m sure I ’m just one of millions of women you ’ve given that look to . ”
38396	38400	38401	38401	He	998	“ Which look ? ”
38462	38477	38456	38456	his	998	“ You know which look . And step back . You ’re crowding me . ”
38478	38506	38507	38507	I	0	“ No . I want to talk about this look you ’re so upset by . I want you to tell me what you think it means . ”
38540	38549	38550	38550	I	0	“ I do n’t know what it means , ”
38579	38585	38586	38586	he	998	“ Such a terrible liar , ”
38734	38755	38731	38731	Matteo	108	“ I ’d love to be part of whatever conversation you ’re having in your head right now , bella . ”
38773	38794	38795	38795	He	108	“ I was thinking I have a lot of work to do . I was thinking you should leave now . ”
38828	38836	38837	38837	He	108	“ I do n’t accept your apology . ”
38850	38889	38890	38890	He	108	“ I do n’t think it was sincere . I think you should show me how sorry you are for the way you talk to me , bella . And I think you should do it like this . ”
39324	39339	39321	39321	he	108	“ I want to hear you make that sound when I ’m inside you . ”
39451	39478	39443	39443	he	108	“ You see ? We do n’t have to be enemies . Let me buy the business , and we can be the best of friends . ”
39526	39549	39550	39550	He	108	“ Wait . Wait — did you just kiss me to try to get me to sell you my father ’s business ? ”
39578	39583	39563	39563	I	0	“ Answer the question . ”
39616	39631	39603	39603	he	108	“ Oh my God . You . . . you . . . mercenary ! ”
39652	39688	39639	39639	His	108	“ The company will be better off in my hands . If you want to honor your father ’s memory , let someone run it who can make it the success it deserves to be . ”
39751	39780	39738	39738	I	0	“ Fuck you , Matteo Moretti . Fuck you and that high horse you rode in on , and fuck your ego , and fuck your fake kiss . ”
39781	39790	39845	39845	He	108	“ Which you loved , by the way . ”
39791	39801	39802	39802	I	0	“ And fuck that stupid smirk on your face , ”
39818	39844	39802	39802	I	0	“ Now get out of my shop . And do n’t ever come back , or I ’ll make you wish you were never born . ”
40137	40146	40147	40147	I	0	“ Sorry I ’m so late , Loren — ”
40161	40178	40159	40159	Lorenzo	107	“ Do n’t look so surprised to see me . My mother lives here , remember ? ”
40292	40304	40286	40286	He	107	“ Ah . Signorina . We were just talking about you . ”
40336	40341	40342	40342	I	0	“ Were you now ? ”
40346	40351	40342	40342	I	0	“ Sounds like fun . ”
40387	40396	40377	40377	He	108	“ Can I get you something to eat ? ”
40397	40405	40406	40406	I	0	“ You can get me a gun , ”
40601	40610	40611	40611	I	0	“ Get out of my bed , dog ! ”
40655	40658	40646	40646	I	0	“ Out ! ”
40701	40713	40683	40683	she	101	“ Oh my God . This is a frickin ’ circus . ”
40880	40897	40867	40867	Matteo	108	“ Look who it is . Count Egotistico . Here to give me another fake kiss ? ”
40898	40905	40906	40906	His	108	“ If you ’ll let me . ”
40919	40928	40914	40914	I	0	“ I think I ’ll pass , thanks . ”
40968	40982	40983	40983	He	108	“ You know , hate and love are n’t so different , bella . ”
41010	41025	41026	41026	He	108	“ Why do you enjoy torturing me ? Are you some kind of sadist ? ”
41039	41066	41067	41067	He	108	“ They ’re two sides of the same coin , really . Passion , obsession , sweaty palms , and a racing heart . Lost sleep . ”
41081	41086	41069	41069	his	108	“ A poor appetite . ”
41087	41125	41131	41131	he	108	“ You want a poor appetite ? I ’ll give you a poor appetite . I ’ll take that salami and wedge it so far down your throat you wo n’t be able to eat ever again . ”
41134	41137	41138	41138	he	108	“ Passion , ”
41156	41163	41146	41146	I	0	“ Let ’s call a truce . ”
41182	41201	41202	41202	He	108	“ No truce . No way . And you ’re the one who started this war , remember ? ”
41212	41232	41208	41208	he	108	“ Yes , you . Wait , why am I even talking to you ? You fake kissed me ! ”
41233	41237	41202	41202	He	108	“ Did I ? ”
41238	41246	41202	41202	He	108	“ Yes ! You admitted you did ! ”
41247	41256	41208	41208	he	108	“ Hmm . I do n’t recall that . ”
41257	41270	41202	41202	He	108	“ So we ’ll add dementia to your long list of problems . ”
41326	41333	41334	41334	I	0	“ I ’m not a joke , ”
41341	41348	41334	41334	I	0	“ I ’m not a plaything . ”

41432	41444	41400	41400	He	108	“ So dirty , bella . So very , very dirty . ”
41445	41466	41467	41467	He	108	“ I ’m not selling the company , no matter how much you try to sex it out of me . ”
41472	41479	41467	41467	He	108	“ Sex it out of you ? ”
41497	41507	41487	41487	he	108	“ Now that sounds interesting . Let ’s discuss . ”

41949	41972	41973	41973	She	2402	“ If you really want to annoy him , make fun of his hair . He ’s obsessed he might lose it . ”

42387	42412	42373	42373	he	108	“ Since you ’re going to be living in Italy now , I assume you ’ll be attending Fashion Week in Milan next month ? ”
42431	42445	42446	42446	He	108	“ I ’d have to get an invitation . Why do you ask ? ”
42463	42488	42489	42489	He	108	“ I think you ’ll be interested to see the House of Moretti ’s spring collection . We have some truly incredible new designs . ”

42816	42847	42761	42761	He	58	“ Unfortunately , no . But I am currently in bed with a lovely Japanese lad who I was inside of earlier , so it ’s practically the same thing . ”
42848	42865	42761	42761	He	58	“ Oh shit . What time is it there ? I keep forgetting about time zones . ”
42866	42900	42761	42761	He	58	“ Never mind , I ’ve been up all night anyway . How are you ? What ’s happening with my darling love Matteo ? Tell me everything and hurry up about it . ”

43115	43129	43111	43111	he	58	“ That means you ’re serious , which means you ’re seriously deluded . ”
43130	43136	43140	43140	he	58	“ I ’m not deluded ! ”
43143	43205	43140	43140	he	58	“ You ’re really starting to worry me , darling . First it was moving to Florence , now it ’s crashing an exclusive invite - only event that will be crawling with security . The next thing I know you ’ll be telling me you want me to model one of your dresses on the catwalk or some such nonsense . ”
43214	43224	43211	43211	Jenner	58	“ Oh no . No , no , no . ”

43239	43245	43211	43211	Jenner	58	“ That ’s emotional blackmail ! ”
43246	43282	43283	43283	He	58	“ I need you , Jenner . Not only are you a professional model — an amazing model — you’re the prettiest person I know . No one has cheekbones or a pout like you . ”

Of course not . One of us still has his sanity . ”

43475	43538	43377	43377	He	58	“ Please . No one would let that woman near a catwalk with those enormous boobs of hers . I ’m not even sure they ’d let her in the front door — they’d turn her around and shuttle her off to the nearest Hooters ! Honestly , how you people can walk around with those things , I ’ll never know . ”

I can just see you now , shakin ’ your moneymakers for all the drooling old gents in their wheelchairs ! Oh , I can hardly wait . We should pick out your stripper name now so we ’ll be ready . How does it go , the name of your first pet and the street you lived on growing up ? Yes , that ’s it . ”
43659	43667	43654	43654	He	1063	“ My stripper name is Frisky Broadmoor ! ”

All that time and all that love I gave you . . . and you repaid it with disloyalty and public humiliation . And now you ’re here to what ? Ask my forgiveness ? ”

A life to share and a strong shoulder to lean on , someone to build a future with . Have a family with . Grow old with . I wanted all that with you but you robbed me . And the really shitty part , the thing I just ca n’t get over , is that you made me believe you wanted it all , too . ”

65804	65814	65613	65613	I	0	“ Hold on — stepbrother ? Your dad remarried ? ”
65815	65839	65613	65613	I	0	“ Oh ho ! Welcome to the conversation ! Jesus , it ’s like you have selective hearing . Yes , he remarried . ”
65840	65848	65780	65780	I	0	“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
65849	65897	65613	65613	I	0	“ Because I did n’t know . From what I ’m told , it was all hush - hush because my father did n’t want to take any attention away from our wedding . He was planning on telling me after we got back from the honeymoon . ”
65898	65905	65613	65613	I	0	“ That makes no sense whatsoever . ”

65947	65955	65937	65937	Brad	60	“ So what ’s his wife like ? ”
65956	65989	65613	65613	I	0	“ If Nurse Ratched and the iceberg that sank the Titanic had a love child , it would be her . She was the blonde yesterday who said you should be shot . ”
65990	66010	65937	65937	Brad	60	“ Yikes . I ’m surprised your dad would ’ve married someone like that . He seemed so nice . ”
66052	66066	66067	66067	He	251	“ I guess falling in love with terrible people runs in the family . ”

66176	66179	66112	66112	he	251	“ No . ”
66205	66273	66202	66202	he	251	“ I ’m sorry . I know I messed up . I know I hurt you . I just got caught up in the whole thing . The planning , your excitement , my parents ’ excitement . I was so happy that everyone else was happy , but then it felt like I was riding a speeding train and there was no way to get off . ”

66375	66417	66364	66364	he	1403	“ I do care about you . I do love you , in my way . More than anything in the world , I wanted to be what you wanted . I never thought anyone would ever want me for myself . ”
66489	66536	66474	66474	she	1405	“ Look . If you really want to do something for me , have all my stuff at the apartment packed up and put it into storage . I ’m not gon na be back in time to get that done before the lease is up . ”
66537	66543	66474	66474	she	1405	“ Done . What else ? ”
66544	66551	66552	66552	He	1403	“ Come out to your parents . ”
66563	66568	66552	66552	He	1403	“ I ca n’t ! ”
66569	66620	66630	66630	he	1403	“ So what ’s your plan , then , genius ? Troll some other stupid girl into falling in love with you so you can keep up this charade of being someone you ’re not ? Because if I find out you do that , I ’ll out you myself . ”
66637	66642	66630	66630	he	1403	“ You would n’t . ”
66643	66647	66552	66552	He	1403	“ Try me . ”
66648	66651	66652	66652	He	1403	“ Kimber ! ”

66698	66721	66552	66552	He	1403	“ But if I do n’t marry , my father will cut me off ! Where am I gon na get money ? ”
66722	66733	66552	66552	He	1403	“ Try getting a job like the rest of us ! ”
66734	66754	66630	66630	he	1403	“ Doing what ? You know the only things I ’m good at are working out and planning vacations . ”
66803	66827	66552	66552	He	1403	“ You ’re good at mixing cocktails and chatting up strangers , too . You could get a job on a cruise ship . ”
66828	66831	66552	66552	He	1403	“ Ha . ”
66832	66847	66848	66848	He	1412	“ I have a solution , but you ’re not going to like it . ”

66871	66926	66552	66552	He	1403	“ I ’m serious . Ask your attorney what that trust actually says . Get a copy of it and read it . I ’ll bet your father did n’t put anything in there that stipulates you have to marry a woman . The thought never would have even occurred to Mr. Family Values . ”
66943	66962	66935	66935	he	1412	“ Yeah , marinate on it . And while you ’re marinating , go back to the States . ”
66963	66977	66552	66552	He	1403	“ Before you hang up , I have one last thing to say . ”
66978	66983	66984	66984	He	1412	“ What is it ? ”
66990	67000	66984	66984	He	1412	“ Do you think your stepbrother is into guys ? ”

67760	67776	67753	67753	He	90	“ You ’re going to put her in a sex coma , is that it ? ”
67779	67799	67753	67753	He	90	“ I ’m going to convince her it ’s better to have me as a friend than an enemy . ”
67829	67837	67838	67838	He	90	“ You ’ve threatened this poor woman ? ”

67899	67904	67905	67905	Antonio	90	“ It ’s complicated . ”
67958	67997	67954	67954	he	90	“ Stealing is n’t the way to compensate for the designs that snake Riccardo destroyed when he left . This is beneath the House of Moretti . This is beneath you . We ’ll scale down the show — ”
67998	68006	68007	68007	I	0	“ There has to be fifty pieces , ”

68114	68156	68157	68157	He	90	“ Eh , my takeaway . My takeaway is that you ’ve lost your mind . I should look for a new job now , before word gets out that I work in a den of thieves and I ’m unemployable . ”
68164	68185	68162	68162	himself	90	“ To think of all the years of dedicated service I ’ve given you . My loyalty repaid like this . ”

68298	68315	68291	68291	he	90	“ I never said I stole the designs , you carping old woman . We traded . ”
68328	68331	68316	68316	He	90	“ Traded ? ”
68332	68338	68291	68291	he	90	“ For a plane ticket . ”
68339	68349	68316	68316	He	90	“ Well , why did n’t you say so ? ”

68431	68441	68442	68442	He	90	“ What if I said she ’s my stepsister ? ”
68499	68506	68488	68488	He	90	“ Sorry — ex - stepsister . ”
68507	68518	68488	68488	He	90	“ But . . . you ’re attracted to her . ”
68519	68542	68488	68488	He	90	“ Of course I ’m attracted to her . A man would have to be blind not to be attracted to her . ”
68584	68592	68581	68581	he	90	“ It still seems like a sin . ”

68627	68640	68616	68616	He	90	“ I do n’t make the rules . Talk to the pope . ”
68655	68682	68643	68643	I	0	“ I do n’t need to talk to the pope . It ’s not a sin . It ’s not illegal . It ’s not anything . ”
68683	68697	68616	68616	He	90	“ If it ’s not anything , why are you so worked up ? ”
68726	68732	68708	68708	I	0	“ She ’s ignoring me . ”

69024	69103	69015	69015	he	90	“ Ah , Matteo . You make a very handsome couple . The children — oh ! They ’ll be beautiful . I ’ve worried so long about you being alone . All you do is work , never taking time to meet a nice woman and settle down . I ’m sure if you write the pope a letter explaining the entire situation , he wo n’t let your souls burn in the eternal lake of fire . ”
69111	69115	69116	69116	Antonio	90	“ Jesus Christ . ”

74343	74353	74354	74354	He	69	“ Oh right . Ha ha . Good one . ”
74436	74440	74432	74432	Whoever	187	“ love is blind ”
74514	74517	74488	74488	he	69	“ I do ”
74619	74640	74604	74604	his	69	“ The way you ’re looking at me is , um , kinda scary . Did I say something wrong ? ”
74771	74815	74768	74768	I	0	“ I ’m still mad at you for being dishonest . But it ’s not all your fault . I ca n’t hang all the blame on you , because I was busy being an idiot , too , just in different ways . ”
74822	74853	74816	74816	I	0	“ So if you ever decide to come out to your parents , I ’ll go with you . You wo n’t have to handle that conversation alone . Okay ? ”
74896	74899	74893	74893	he	69	“ Okay . ”
74960	74963	74964	74964	he	69	“ Sorry , ”
74977	74999	75000	75000	He	69	“ I ’ve seen you cry more in the last week than I have in the entire time we were together . ”
75003	75012	75000	75000	He	69	“ Tough guys are n’t supposed to cry . ”
75088	75093	75082	75082	his	69	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
75094	75108	75109	75109	He	69	“ It ’s inconvenient feeling empathy for someone you previously decided to hate . ”
75122	75132	75114	75114	his	69	“ So that means you do n’t hate me ? ”
75152	75170	75140	75140	I	0	“ How is this my life , God ? Did I do something to personally offend you ? ”
75195	75251	75171	75171	Brad	60	“ Because I ’d do anything to stay friends with you , even if you do n’t want the money and stuff . I meant it when I said you were the only one I ever felt safe with . You ’re my best friend , and there ’s nothing I would n’t do to — ”
75252	75269	75270	75270	I	0	“ We ’re not breaking out the BFF charm bracelets and matching outfits yet , pal , ”
75274	75297	75270	75270	I	0	“ Let ’s wait until after I get the results from my STD test to see how things are going to go . ”
75298	75303	75304	75304	I	0	“ I ’m clean ! ”
75317	75323	75304	75304	I	0	“ You sound pretty sure . ”
75324	75334	75339	75339	he	1533	“ I am . I get tested every month ! ”
75408	75433	75434	75434	He	1533	“ If you were ‘ safe , ’ like you said you always were , why would you need to get tested every month ? ”
75441	75457	75434	75434	He	1533	“ I ’m afraid if I tell you the truth , you ’ll deck me . ”
75458	75467	75468	75468	He	1533	“ I might deck you anyway . Talk . ”
75492	75546	75547	75547	He	1533	“ Because nothing is one hundred percent effective there ’s always a chance you can pick up something bad even if you use protection and I was scared I might pass something on to you so I got tested a lot to make sure I was clean so you would n’t catch anything . ”
75575	75587	75588	75588	He	1533	“ You ’re telling me you were trying to protect me ? ”
75591	75605	75588	75588	He	1533	“ From getting a sexually transmitted disease that you might unknowingly have had ? ”
75622	75657	75658	75658	He	1533	“ Because you were sleeping around so much , with so many different partners , that the risk of catching a nasty virus was so high you had to be tested once a month ? ”
75662	75674	75658	75658	He	1533	“ Sometimes more often than that , just to be sure . ”
75679	75692	75676	75676	he	1533	“ But I ’m totally clean , so we ’re all good ! ”
75753	75761	75741	75742	a man	392	“ I hope I ’m not interrupting . ”
75996	76003	76004	76004	Kimber	56	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
76017	76026	76014	76014	her	56	“ I was on my way to work . ”
76137	76144	76130	76130	her	56	“ So continue on your way . ”
76169	76178	76166	76166	I	0	“ You do n’t need to me stay ? ”
76187	76190	76185	76185	she	56	“ No , ”

76535	76545	76521	76521	she	56	“ I ’m not doing this with you now . ”

76555	76562	76563	76563	she	56	“ Do n’t play that game , ”
76598	76606	76585	76585	she	56	“ What do you want from me ? ”
76636	76643	76621	76621	I	0	“ Time to eat the frog . ”
76649	76653	76644	76644	She	56	“ Excuse me ? ”
76654	76698	76699	76699	Her	56	“ It ’s something my father used to say . If eating a frog is the worst thing you have to do in a day , do n’t put it off . Do it first thing and get it out of the way . ”
76707	76719	76699	76699	Her	56	“ You ’re comparing kissing me to eating a fucking frog ? ”
76827	76840	76841	76841	I	0	“ It ’s a metaphor . But I was talking about you , ”
76850	76884	76841	76841	I	0	“ I ’m the frog you have to eat . Might as well get it over with early so you do n’t have to think about it for the rest of your day . ”
76889	76912	76841	76841	I	0	“ You do n’t get to call all the shots here . You ca n’t just show up unannounced , demanding kisses . ”
76913	76934	76935	76935	She	56	“ Yes I can . I just did . And I ’ll do it again . Give me my kiss . ”
76939	76963	76935	76935	She	56	“ For a guy who said I ’m a mediocre kisser , you ’re awfully eager to shove your tongue down my throat . ”
77002	77017	77018	77018	She	56	“ I ’m sorry . That was stupid . It wo n’t happen again . ”
77040	77049	77035	77035	she	56	“ Why did you say it , then ? ”
77050	77058	77059	77059	She	56	“ I wanted to rile you up . ”
77076	77091	77067	77067	her	56	“ So . . . you do n’t think I ’m a bad kisser ? ”
77268	77293	77265	77265	I	0	“ If I thought you were a bad kisser , I would n’t be trying so hard to kiss you , now would I ? ”
77326	77338	77323	77323	she	56	“ Okay , fine , let ’s get this over with . ”
77469	77478	77464	77464	She	183	“ Clara . Uh . Whuz happenin ’ ? ”

77777	77794	77767	77767	His	108	“ Are you sure you ’re ready to go back to work ? You seem disoriented . ”
77795	77801	77817	77817	he	108	“ I am totally fine . ”
77858	77861	77862	77862	He	108	“ Fine ? ”
77876	77886	77862	77862	He	108	“ I ’ll have to do better next time . ”

77973	77997	77963	77963	he	108	“ That ’s reasonable . How about after dinner every night ? Say , eight o’clock ? I ’ll drop by the house . ”
78031	78042	78028	78028	I	0	“ Okay . Good . See you then . Bye . ”

78132	78147	78124	78124	she	1564	“ Tell him Brad is gay and there ’s nothing going on between you . ”
78158	78167	78168	78168	he	108	“ Drag this smug asshole over the coals , ”
78174	78234	78168	78168	he	108	“ You think you ’re the only broad he ’s makin ’ a run for ? Do n’t be naive . He ’s got tail all over town . You ca n’t be this stupid again . And by the way , dipshit , you ’re supposed to be thinking with your brain , not your vagina , remember ? ”
78267	78274	78275	78275	Matteo	108	“ I asked him to come . ”
78287	78290	78282	78282	his	108	“ Why ? ”
78291	78297	78303	78303	he	108	“ We have unfinished business . ”
78319	78323	78324	78324	he	108	“ Unfinished business , ”
78362	78394	78395	78395	Matteo	108	“ He ’s begged me to forgive him . He ’s apologized , and I believe he ’s truly sorry . And now . . . we ’re working it out . ”
78441	78449	78438	78438	He	108	“ What exactly are you working out ? ”
78467	78480	78438	78438	He	108	“ Give me all my sketches back and I ’ll tell you . ”
78503	78524	78492	78492	I	0	“ You sure are crabby all of a sudden , Count . Are you feeling okay ? You seem disoriented . ”
78564	78598	78557	78557	He	108	“ Not as disoriented as you were a moment ago , bella . I could ’ve pushed you against the wall and taken you standing up , you were so ready for it . ”
78653	78662	78636	78636	His	108	“ Challenge accepted . See you at eight . ”
78788	78797	78776	78776	Matteo	108	“ Do you not know how to drive ? ”
78798	78815	78816	78816	He	108	“ You people drive like psychos . I do n’t want to get into an accident . ”
78834	78854	78829	78829	he	108	“ I ’m happy to drive you to and from work . All you have to do is ask . ”
78855	78874	78875	78875	His	108	“ So you can spy on me and see what new designs I ’m creating ? No thanks . ”
78882	78899	78875	78875	His	108	“ Is that why you think I came by this morning ? To spy on you ? ”
78900	78919	78920	78920	He	108	“ I find it hard to believe you ’d go to all this trouble just to kiss me . ”
78949	78955	78937	78937	he	108	“ It ’s no trouble . ”
79013	79017	79018	79018	I	0	“ All right , ”

79075	79090	79091	79091	He	108	“ I have n’t , either , but this is n’t a dinner date . ”
79115	79122	79112	79112	he	108	“ What is it , then ? ”
79123	79128	79112	79112	he	108	“ A business deal . ”
79171	79181	79182	79182	He	108	“ You want to conduct business in the driveway ? ”
79227	79237	79238	79238	He	108	“ We ca n’t do it inside , either . ”
79250	79254	79255	79255	I	0	“ The garden . ”
79316	79323	79325	79325	Matteo	108	“ It ’s only a kiss , ”
79332	79347	79325	79325	Matteo	108	“ Two minutes . I ’ll time it again so you ’ll be safe . ”
79580	79587	79588	79588	I	0	“ I ca n’t do this , ”

79946	79959	79914	79914	him	108	“ You do n’t like that I know what you ’re feeling . ”
80003	80019	80020	80020	I	0	“ But you know what I ’m feeling , too , so we ’re even . ”
80023	80039	80020	80020	I	0	“ I do n’t know what you ’re feeling . I do n’t know anything . ”
80062	80074	80055	80055	his	108	“ Yes you do . You just do n’t trust it . ”
80075	80096	80122	80122	his	108	“ I ca n’t trust it . Not only do I have questionable taste in men , we ’re enemies . ”
80097	80104	80122	80122	his	108	“ Frenemies . With kissing benefits . ”
80105	80113	80055	80055	his	108	“ That ’s not even a thing . ”

80355	80379	80387	80387	he	108	“ I just realized you have n’t given me a sketch yet . For this morning , either . You owe me two . ”
80380	80386	80387	80387	he	108	“ When we ’re done , ”
80602	80620	80594	80594	His	108	“ Whatever ’s happening between you and your ex , remember this : I ’m not him . ”

81172	81183	81169	81169	he	1611	“ Yeah , that was an unfortunate choice of words . ”
81184	81205	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ Speaking of unfortunate choices , you might want to dial back the swooneration if you ever see Matteo again . ”
81206	81213	81214	81214	I	0	“ Why , is he homophobic ? ”
81217	81242	81243	81243	Brad	60	“ Homophobia is such an inaccurate word . It ’s not a phobia . No one ’s afraid . They ’re just an asshole . ”
81246	81257	81243	81243	Brad	60	“ I think Samuel L. Jackson might ’ve said that . ”
81258	81266	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ Probably . He ’s very wise . ”
81267	81273	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ Back to the swooneration . ”
81274	81292	81300	81300	he	1611	“ Well , from the looks of things , it makes him want to kick your ass . ”
81303	81307	81300	81300	he	1611	“ Two things . ”
81308	81311	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ Shoot . ”
81312	81327	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ One : You did n’t tell him I was gay , did you ? ”
81328	81331	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ Nope . ”
81332	81336	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ Why not ? ”
81337	81364	81365	81365	Brad	60	“ You have n’t even come out to your parents . It ’s not my place to be spilling your private business all over the world . ”
81376	81394	81365	81365	Brad	60	“ I ca n’t believe you ’d have my back like that , after what I did . ”
81395	81465	81141	81141	Brad	60	“ I know . I ’m amazing . You do n’t deserve me . But remember my silence does n’t apply to any female you might want to trick into marrying you by pretending you ’re straight . Where you like to stick your dick is your business until you try to ruin another poor girl ’s life , then all bets are off . What ’s number two ? ”
81466	81474	81365	81365	Brad	60	“ How serious are you about him ? ”
81507	81543	81501	81501	Brad	60	“ We were together for three years , Kimber . I know you think I ’m clueless , but even I can see that you never looked at me the way you look at him . ”
81568	81629	81561	81561	I	0	“ Maybe someday we ’ll look back on this and laugh . Maybe someday , after a few years have passed and I ’ve grown scar tissue over all the holes you tore in my heart , we can be friends again . But right now I have to be honest and say it ’s none of your damn business . ”
81630	81642	81707	81707	he	1613	“ It is , though , because I care about you . ”
81643	81654	81655	81655	I	0	“ You ’ve got a funny way of showing it , ”
81658	81667	81655	81655	I	0	“ I looked him up , you know . ”
81668	81676	81707	81707	he	1613	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
81677	81686	81707	81707	he	1613	“ On the internet . I researched him . ”
81687	81703	81704	81704	He	1613	“ Whatever you ’re about to tell me , I do n’t want to know . ”
81713	81716	81707	81707	he	1613	“ Liar . ”
81735	81743	81730	81730	myself	0	“ He ’s a womanizer , right ? ”
81744	81772	81773	81773	I	0	“ More like a monk . He has n’t been photographed with anyone for years . According to the gossip sites , he ’s obsessed with work . ”
81777	81788	81773	81773	I	0	“ Or he ’s just really good at keeping secrets . ”
81789	81798	81730	81730	myself	0	“ Not everyone has skeletons in their closets . ”
81799	81810	81730	81730	myself	0	“ Do n’t you dare talk to me about closets . ”
81817	81831	81811	81811	Brad	60	“ Right . Oops . It ’s kinda funny , though , right ? ”

85493	85579	85580	85580	He	1654	“ You told me you wanted to buy my father ’s business . You made it clear you do n’t think I have what it takes to make it in fashion here . And this game you ’re playing , the kissing game — what ’s the point ? Are you hoping I ’ll develop feelings for you so I ’ll sell ? Are you trying to make me fall in love with you so you can get what you really want — the business ? ”
85596	85604	85589	85589	His	1654	“ Do you have feelings for me ? ”

85932	85941	85926	85926	His	1654	“ Tell me if you ’re manipulating me . ”
85952	85962	85949	85949	his	1654	“ I told you — I’m not your ex . ”
85963	85996	85997	85997	He	1654	“ Which is exactly what a man trying to manipulate me would say . It would ’ve been easier for you to simply say no . Unless the real answer is yes . ”
86015	86167	85997	85997	He	1654	“ Okay , you want me to talk to you ? Here goes . I ’ll give you my worst - case scenario . Your mother — who , by your own admission , is disappointed in you — needs some insurance on my promise not to kick her out of the house . She got nothing from my father in his will , which must ’ve really stung , but his dopey daughter was recently dumped in the most spectacular way , and she ’s vulnerable . She owns a business that you ’d like to get your hands on and an expensive house your mother would like to legally get her hands on , so the two of you decide that you ’ll work your magic and make the dopey daughter fall in love with you so she ’ll hand over the keys to the kingdom with a smile . “
86257	86274	86284	86284	He	108	“ Except me . The idiot Kimberella , screwed by another toad masquerading as a prince . ”

86351	86358	86346	86346	His	108	“ Tell me I ’m wrong . ”
86359	86371	86372	86372	he	108	“ That ’s the kind of man you think I am , ”
86375	86405	86372	86372	he	108	“ A lying , scheming , manipulative prick so desperate for his mother ’s approval he ’d fake his attraction to you before he even knew who you were . ”
86414	86467	86411	86411	he	108	“ At the airport , I did n’t know who you were . At the hotel , I still did n’t know who you were . I only found out you were Luca ’s daughter when I walked into the living room of this house and you were sitting on the sofa . ”
86493	86514	86484	86484	he	108	“ Maybe you decided after you discovered who I was that the mutual attraction would make it easier all around . ”
86515	86525	86526	86526	he	108	“ Easier to fuck you over , you mean , ”
86582	86617	86618	86618	He	108	“ Tell me you ’re not . Tell me I ’ve made the whole thing up in my head . Tell me what you and your mother were talking about when I came in . ”
86623	86630	86618	86618	He	108	“ We were talking about you . ”
86635	86640	86641	86641	I	0	“ What about me ? ”
86652	86669	86648	86648	He	108	“ You would n’t believe me if I told you , so what ’s the point ? ”
86670	86677	86648	86648	He	108	“ Maybe you should try me ! ”
86678	86685	86686	86686	I	0	“ Maybe you should trust me ! ”
86702	86716	86695	86695	I	0	“ Sorry , Count , trust is something I ’m fresh out of . ”
86750	86759	86760	86760	He	108	“ I ’m . A. Fucking . Marchese . ”
86787	86796	86784	86784	I	0	“ Way to put some stank on it ! ”
87242	87257	87231	87231	she	65	“ I ca n’t believe you have n’t called me back in two weeks ! ”
87258	87287	87227	87227	she	65	“ I know . I ’m a terrible friend . But life has decided I ’m great for target practice , and I ’ve been busy dodging bullets . ”
87288	87301	87227	87227	she	65	“ Your dad . Oh , honey , I ’m so sorry . ”
87302	87307	87231	87231	she	65	“ Jenner told you ? ”
87308	87361	87227	87227	she	65	“ He did . Also about your shop , your hot stepbrother , your weird stepmother , and the two dress - wearing dogs who eat at the table . I ’ve been pestering him constantly for updates . Your life has more plot twists than the subtitled Korean melodramas I watch . ”
87362	87386	87231	87231	she	65	“ If it makes you feel any better , you ’re the first one to hear this : Brad followed me to Italy . ”
87408	87411	87227	87227	she	65	“ What ? ”
87412	87419	87227	87227	she	65	“ And he ’s still here . ”
87420	87423	87227	87227	she	65	“ No ! ”
87424	87427	87227	87227	she	65	“ Yep . ”
87428	87435	87227	87227	she	65	“ What does that rat want ? ”
87436	87442	87443	87443	I	0	“ Redemption , I suppose . ”
87453	87468	87443	87443	I	0	“ He begged me to forgive him . He still wants to get married . ”
87481	87495	87476	87476	she	65	“ That dick . The nerve ! Have you hired the hitman yet ? ”
87496	87512	87227	87227	she	65	“ I do n’t know any hitmen . Not every Italian is in the mafia . ”
87513	87535	87476	87476	she	65	“ But every Italian probably knows someone in the mafia , right ? Or someone who knows someone who knows someone . ”
87536	87546	87476	87476	she	65	“ You ’ve been watching too many crime shows . ”
87547	87551	87552	87552	she	65	“ Oh right , ”
87558	87572	87552	87552	she	65	“ You ca n’t tell me . Plausible deniability . That ’s smart . ”
87573	87581	87476	87476	she	65	“ There ’s no hitman , Danielle . ”
87582	87588	87589	87589	She	65	“ Sure there is n’t . ”
87597	87606	87589	87589	She	65	“ Do you think the line is tapped ? ”
87607	87637	87638	87638	Her	65	“ No , but I do think you should take up writing mystery novels . That imagination of yours is being wasted . How are Brian and the kids ? ”
87642	87681	87638	87638	Her	65	“ Everyone ’s good . The kids are back to school soon , which is lucky because I ’m one mood change away from a meltdown . I do n’t remember us being so dramatic at that age . ”
87727	87742	87687	87687	She	65	“ We were too busy being dorky to be dramatic . Remember my hairstyle ? ”
87743	87766	87687	87687	She	65	“ Sweet Jesus , the perm . You looked like you styled your hair by sticking your finger into an electrical outlet . ”
87767	87775	87687	87687	She	65	“ Let ’s not forget your headgear . ”
87776	87802	87687	87687	She	65	“ Four years of wandering around in public looking like I ’d just arrived from outer space . I ’m still not over the trauma . ”
87803	87837	87687	87687	She	65	“ At least you got those beautiful straight teeth at the end of it . I ’m still stuck with hair that refuses to hold a curl unless it ’s chemically forced to . ”
87838	87861	87687	87687	She	65	“ Your hair is gorgeous ! Do you know how many girls with frizzy hair would kill for it to be straight ? ”
87877	87882	87871	87871	I	0	“ I miss you . ”
87883	87910	87687	87687	She	65	“ I miss you , too . When are you headed back to San Fran ? I can probably arrange to come out for Labor Day . ”
87911	87929	87871	87871	I	0	“ I ’m not going back to San Francisco . I ’ve decided to stay in Italy . ”
87937	87949	87930	87930	Danielle	65	“ Does this have anything to do with the hot stepbrother ? ”
87950	87953	87687	87687	She	65	“ No . ”
87956	87969	87687	87687	She	65	“ It ’s just time for me to make a clean start . ”
87970	88001	87930	87930	Danielle	65	“ Did you tell Jenner that ? I ca n’t imagine he ’d let you move thousands of miles away that easily . You two are attached at the hip . ”
88002	88034	87687	87687	She	65	“ Yes , I told him . He does n’t approve . He ’ll be here in a few weeks for the Milan fashion shows . He ’ll browbeat me then . ”
88035	88054	87687	87687	She	65	“ Good luck . I would n’t want to be on the end of a browbeating from Jenner . ”
88055	88063	87930	87930	Danielle	65	“ He ’s more bark than bite . ”
88064	88085	87687	87687	She	65	“ Are you kidding ? I ’ve seen him reduce people to tears with one look . He ’s terrifying . ”
88086	88099	88100	88100	I	0	“ He ’s British . They ’re skilled at frightening the peasants . ”
88119	88138	88112	88112	someone	300	“ Honey , I have to go , but I promise I ’ll call you soon , okay ? ”
88139	88165	87687	87687	She	65	“ You better , or I ’ll send my girls to Italy for their next school break and let you deal with the little monsters . ”
88166	88171	88221	88221	He	108	“ Speaking of terrifying . ”
88172	88178	88112	88112	someone	300	“ Love you , kiddo . ”
88179	88187	87687	87687	She	65	“ Love you , too . Bye . ”

88483	88498	88499	88499	he	108	“ I ’m not going to use your designs and claim they ’re mine , ”
88556	88566	88553	88553	I	0	“ What brought about this sudden change of heart ? ”
88567	88581	88582	88582	His	108	“ As if you do n’t know . It does n’t matter anyway . ”
88586	88589	88582	88582	His	108	“ Right ? ”
88666	88671	88654	88654	I	0	“ It might matter . ”
88672	88679	88680	88680	he	108	“ Might does n’t cut it , ”

88729	88734	88735	88735	I	0	“ It does matter , ”
88738	88748	88735	88735	I	0	“ I ’m just not sure what that means . ”
88759	88794	88756	88756	he	108	“ I understand . You have a lot to deal with right now . I ’m making your life more complicated . The last thing I want is to be a problem for you . ”
88812	88826	88827	88827	He	108	“ I do n’t want to be a problem for you , either . ”
88830	88854	88827	88827	He	108	“ You ’re not a problem . You ’re the best thing that ’s happened to me since I was ten years old . ”
88878	88881	88882	88882	I	0	“ Oh , ”
88891	88903	88882	88882	I	0	“ Um . What happened when you were ten years old ? ”
88904	88976	88977	88977	His	1691	“ My mother finally bought me the puppy I ’d been begging for . A Great Dane , like Cornelia . I named her Maria , after my favorite opera singer . I loved her with all my heart . She slept in my bed every night , even when she grew too big for it . I ’d scoot all the way to the edge so she ’d have room . ”
89053	89065	89043	89043	I	0	“ You had a favorite opera singer when you were little ? ”

89142	89243	89244	89244	His	1695	“ Yes . She was my best friend . I was outside playing with her when my father died . My mother sent the nanny to get me , but I would n’t come in . I did n’t want to be inside his room , where it smelled like sickness and was dark all the time . So I refused to come in , and my father died , and my mother never forgave me . She sent me away to boarding school after that , but from then on she always had a Great Dane in the house . ”
89249	89264	89244	89244	His	1695	“ It was her way of making sure I never forgot what I did . ”
89405	89411	89412	89412	I	0	“ I had a hamster , ”
89415	89444	89412	89412	I	0	“ Named Bugs . After my favorite cartoon character , Bugs Bunny . He lived a really long time , though . Way past the normal life expectancy . ”

I feel more alive when I ’m around you , even though mostly I ’d like to smack you for being so annoying . I spend most of my time bitching at you when we ’re together , and all of my time thinking about you when we ’re not . I met you at the absolute worst time of my life , when everything I cared about was suddenly taken from me . And now I ’m off balance . I ca n’t trust my own judgment . I ca n’t decide if you ’re a fantasy or a nightmare . A prince or a villain . The best thing that ’s ever happened to me , or the worst . So . . . ”
89739	89760	89761	89761	His	1699	“ I ’m scared . I ’m scared , but I ’ve never wanted anything more than I want you . ”

93121	93125	93126	93126	he	108	“ How romantic , ”
93129	93136	93126	93126	he	108	“ Stop or I ’ll blush . ”
93137	93167	93168	93168	He	108	“ Listen , you just banged me senseless in a dressing room . I ’m in no shape for witty repartee . Can I have my leg back now ? ”
93173	93182	93168	93168	He	108	“ Are you always like this after sex ? ”
93183	93195	93196	93196	I	0	“ Amazingly adorable ? Why , yes . Yes I am . ”
93209	93219	93203	93203	He	108	“ I think I ’m rubbing off on you . ”
93230	93253	93220	93220	I	0	“ I think the rubbing has already been done , sir . Now give me back my leg . I ’m cramping . ”
93298	93307	93295	93295	He	108	“ I could stand here like this forever . ”
93467	93471	93472	93472	Matteo	108	“ Allow me . ”
93517	93523	93524	93524	I	0	“ That was almost professional , ”
93587	93593	93595	93595	I	0	“ You ’re thinking again . ”
93639	93694	93695	93695	He	108	“ I was thinking that you ’re incredible , and this was incredible , and I hope we ’ll keep doing this as often as possible , and also that we should take it one day at a time because I need to be smart and not fall in love with you too fast . ”
93710	93724	93748	93748	Matteo	108	“ That ’s unfortunate , considering I ’m already in love with you . ”
93738	93747	93748	93748	Matteo	108	“ Wha . . . wha . . . ”
93772	93780	93781	93781	he	108	“ I ’m in love with you , ”
93793	93913	93781	93781	he	108	“ I know it ’s ridiculous , and I know it ’s too soon , and I know I ’m in love with you . I did n’t plan on it . I did n’t even want to admit it to myself until I figured out why I have n’t been able to sleep or eat or think straight since I met you . It ’s either love or it ’s insanity , and I do n’t care which because either way it ’s irreversible . It ’s fatal . No other woman has ever moved me the way you do , and if you decide you do n’t want me , it will be the end of me . “
93968	93986	93987	93988	The pope	3013	” I stare at him for a long time , searching his face , dizzy with disbelief . “
93990	93995	93987	93988	The pope	3013	” I say weakly . “
94007	94013	94003	94003	you	0	” My laugh is semicrazed . “

94037	94048	94028	94028	they	1728	” Matteo growls . After a moment , he adds , “
94058	94059	94051	94051	you	1725	” “
94068	94074	94060	94060	I	0	” He kisses me again . “
94082	94083	94075	94075	You	1725	” “
94091	94092	94093	94093	I	0	” “
94106	94116	94093	94093	I	0	” I ’m finding it really hard to breathe . “
94135	94143	94144	94144	I	0	” He waits a beat before saying , “
94157	94165	94144	94144	I	0	” I swallow , moistening my lips . “
94175	94181	94173	94173	Brad	60	” He cocks his head . “
94187	94209	94184	94184	you	1725	” He does n’t look angry at the mention of my ex , so I take that as a good sign . “
94233	94234	94212	94212	you	1725	” “
94237	94238	94212	94212	you	1725	” “
94261	94269	94250	94250	you	1725	” He considers it for a moment . “
94313	94314	94331	94335	a one - man woman	1733	” “
94318	94328	94331	94335	a one - man woman	1733	” He answers without having to think about it . “
94349	94393	94394	94394	You	1725	” A flush of pleasure spreads through my belly . My heart dissolves into a kaleidoscope of butterflies , flitting through my body on gossamer wings . I feel tipsy , as if I ’ve spent the afternoon sipping champagne . Oh no . “
94402	94411	94394	94394	You	1725	” I make a small groan of desperation . “
94433	94444	94394	94394	You	1725	” His eyes blaze with emotion . He says gruffly , “
94448	94515	94394	94394	You	1725	” and gives me a kiss so passionate and pure and full of emotion I know without doubt it can never be matched by another man . The entire time , a bell of warning rings in a distant corner of my mind . If the debacle with Brad taught me anything , it ’s that things that seem too good to be true inevitably are . “
94525	94542	94394	94394	You	1725	” Matteo once told me . Was that a joke . . . or his master plan ?
94547	94597	94546	94546	MATTEO	108	“ If you ’re going to do this right , Matteo , you have to tell her , and you have to tell her in a way that ca n’t be misunderstood . Forget about being the strong , silent type . Women need to hear the actual words . ”
94626	94633	94617	94618	A man	392	“ I ’m in love with you ”
94709	94715	94677	94677	her	2284	“ Are you all right ? ”
94716	94719	94720	94720	she	2284	“ Yes , ”
94731	94763	94724	94724	She	2284	“ Then I ’ll assume you ’re so pale because I ’ve just given you the most earth - shattering orgasms of your life . Anything else will crush my ego . ”
94764	94775	94724	94724	She	2284	“ I seriously doubt your ego could even be dented . ”
94831	94840	94841	94841	She	2284	“ I should probably get back to work . ”
94854	94859	94860	94860	She	2284	“ Look at me . ”
94920	94952	94917	94917	I	0	“ I did n’t plan to declare myself like that . It just came out . I ’m sorry it made you uncomfortable . I wo n’t bring it up again . ”
94976	94982	94983	94983	she	2284	“ Do n’t be sorry , ”
94993	94998	94983	94983	she	2284	“ It was beautiful . ”
95053	95056	95046	95046	Someone	300	“ Shit , ”
95062	95067	95046	95046	Someone	300	“ Someone ’s here ! ”
95068	95071	95072	95073	a man	392	“ Hello ? ”
95150	95153	95143	95143	her	145	“ Hello ? ”
95172	95182	95163	95163	He	96	“ Stay here until I get rid of him . ”
95183	95190	95212	95212	she	145	“ What ? You ’re joking ! ”
95231	95238	95212	95212	she	145	“ I ’m here ! Hello ! ”
95287	95309	95310	95310	My	0	“ How are you , tesoro ? I ’ve been so worried about you , living up there with the barracuda . ”
95380	95392	95376	95376	Kimber	145	“ You do n’t have to worry . Things are okay . ”
95393	95396	95397	95397	Dominic	96	“ Really ? ”
95414	95436	95401	95401	Kimber	145	“ Well , one of her dogs destroyed my entire wardrobe , but that ’s been the only skirmish so far . ”
95437	95469	95470	95470	His	96	“ You need to be careful , Kimber . I did n’t want to speak of it earlier . Things were already so upsetting with your father ’s passing . . . ”
95474	95519	95470	95470	His	96	“ But you ca n’t trust that woman for a moment . The son , either . They ’re a pair of real slick operators , those two . You should get rid of her before she figures out how to get the house . ”
95594	95601	95587	95587	she	145	“ Why do you say that ? ”
95616	95708	95613	95613	Dominic	96	“ Because I know them ! He ’s vicious , and she ’s money hungry . The only reason she married your father is because she thought he had wealth . The house , the business — that ’s what she fell in love with . Not your father . Believe me , I saw how she bled him . And once she found out there was n’t much money to be had , she started pestering him to sell the business . Of course she had a buyer in mind . ”
95713	95719	95722	95722	him	1756	“ Of course she did . ”
95767	95777	95763	95763	her	145	“ How do you know about any of that ? ”
95778	95784	95785	95785	He	1756	“ Your father told me . ”
95827	95851	95812	95812	her	145	“ But . . . in the hospital . . . he told me he loved her . He said he was happy — ”
95852	95859	95860	95860	Dominic	96	“ Your father was a romantic , ”
95864	95901	95860	95860	Dominic	96	“ You know that . A romantic who only saw the best in people . He looked at life through rose - colored glasses . He was a lamb , no match for the Moretti lions . ”
96068	96076	96077	96077	I	0	“ That ’s really upsetting to hear , ”
96085	96094	96077	96077	I	0	“ I do n’t want to believe it . ”
96108	96182	96099	96099	He	96	“ I know . You have a good heart , like your father . It ’s hard to hear such awful things about people . Believe me , tesoro , I hate to have to tell you . But you ’re like a daughter to me , and now that your father ’s gone , it ’s my job to look after you , yes ? So . This is what you do . ”
96194	96207	96183	96183	He	96	“ First thing , you turn the marchesa out of the house . ”
96208	96211	96188	96188	his	96	“ No . ”
96256	96285	96243	96243	I	0	“ My father specified in his will that she stays in the house until she dies . I have to honor that . It ’s what he wanted . ”
96289	96297	96286	96286	Dominic	96	“ But she can not be trusted ! ”
96298	96303	96304	96304	I	0	“ He loved her , ”
96308	96339	96304	96304	I	0	“ He was alone for almost thirty years after my mother died , and for whatever reason , the marchesa made him happy . I wo n’t throw her out . ”
96525	96546	96547	96547	Dominic	96	“ The longer she lives there , the better her case to make a claim of ownership on the property . ”
96570	96585	96627	96627	she	2402	“ And the more she ’ll try to win you over with her wiles ! ”
96586	96599	96627	96627	she	2402	“ Trust me , she ’s not trying to win me over . ”
96600	96622	96627	96627	she	2402	“ No ? She has n’t given you any gifts ? Done anything special for you to make you like her ? ”
96662	96694	96695	96695	Dominic	96	“ Matteo ’s rich . He lives in a castle , for God ’s sake . Their family owns a castle . They ca n’t be that hard up for money ! ”
96708	96744	96695	96695	Dominic	96	“ Castello di Moretti is owned by the family only in name . The government has a lien on the property . Back taxes , my dear . The upkeep on the place is astronomical . ”
96777	96816	96772	96772	I	0	“ Lorenzo has such a high opinion of her . He seems like such a smart guy , and he ’s been with her for so long , how could he not see what she ’s really like ? ”
96817	96823	96824	96824	Dominic	96	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
96828	96836	96824	96824	Dominic	96	“ He ’s in love with her . ”
96869	96872	96873	96873	I	0	“ Right , ”
96988	97001	97006	97006	Dominic	96	“ Sit , sit , you ’re as pale as a ghost ! ”
97090	97095	97084	97084	Dominic	96	“ Are you sick ? ”
97111	97122	97123	97123	I	0	“ I think I ate some bad fish at lunch , ”
97193	97206	97175	97175	he	96	“ Let me take you home , Kimber . You should rest . ”
97207	97212	97213	97213	I	0	“ I ’m fine . ”
97274	97280	97281	97281	he	108	“ You ’re not fine , ”

97392	97397	97384	97384	He	108	“ You believe him . ”
97437	97444	97445	97445	I	0	“ I do n’t want to . ”
97470	97475	97476	97476	I	0	“ But you do . ”

97527	97539	97584	97585	the marchesa	2402	“ Dominic has hated my mother for a very long time . ”
97540	97543	97460	97460	him	108	“ Why ? ”
97544	97550	97460	97460	him	108	“ She married another man . ”
97559	97564	97460	97460	him	108	“ They were together ? ”
97565	97578	97579	97579	I	0	“ When they were very young . Before she met my father . ”
97680	97684	97685	97685	He	108	“ What happened ? ”
97691	97726	97685	97685	He	108	“ Honestly , I do n’t know the details . The only reason I know at all is because I overheard a discussion between her and your father , shortly before they were married . ”
97738	97746	97727	97727	I	0	“ And ? What did they say ? ”
97783	97927	97928	97928	I	0	“ Your father wanted to lend Dominic money . Apparently it was a regular thing , but my mother insisted he ’d been generous enough and should say no . When he asked why she did n’t like Dominic , she said it was n’t that she did n’t like him , but that she knew his character . After your father pressed her , she admitted they had a brief ‘ entanglement , ’ as she called it , before she married my father . My grandfather did n’t approve of Dominic , so he intervened and separated them . Dominic never believed that it was her father . He blamed her . From then on he made it his mission to discredit her name whenever he could . He spread awful rumors . He never forgave her for breaking his heart . ”
97961	97966	97967	97967	I	0	“ Dominic never married , ”
97977	98000	97967	97967	I	0	“ I remember he used to tell my father he found the only woman in Italy who did n’t care about money . ”
98001	98004	98006	98006	Matteo	108	“ Yes , ”
98009	98101	98006	98006	Matteo	108	“ Dominic always makes a big deal about money . Who has it , who does n’t , why he does n’t have enough . Personally , I think the man never had feelings for my mother . I think he saw a paycheck . I think my grandfather realized it , too . My mother was his only child , and the light of his life . If he thought Dominic was a good man , he never would ’ve separated them , no matter how small Dominic ’s fortune . ”
98118	98135	98136	98136	Matteo	108	“ What about Castello di Moretti ? Does the government really have a lien on it ? ”
98148	98151	98145	98145	he	108	“ No . ”
98193	98197	98198	98198	Clara	183	“ Miss Kimber . ”
98208	98213	98198	98198	Clara	183	“ Yes , Clara ? ”
98214	98219	98221	98221	Matteo	108	“ If you have a moment”—she

98259	98265	98256	98256	he	108	“ Well . I tried . ”
98298	98314	98288	98288	He	108	“ I meant everything I said in the dressing room . At least believe that . ”
98405	98413	98402	98402	I	0	“ My life is a Shakespearean drama ! ”
98421	98468	98418	98418	Clara	183	“ Hopefully not the kind where everyone dies at the end . Are you coming , or should we all go home ? We ’re getting old back here . My husband wants stromboli for dinner tonight , and it ’s not going to make itself . ”
98476	98488	98469	98469	I	0	“ You know my father ’s friend , Dominic , right ? ”
98489	98492	98565	98565	She	183	“ Yes . ”
98493	98501	98502	98502	She	183	“ What do you think of him ? ”
98505	98564	98502	98502	She	183	“ He ’s a man . What ’s there to think ? They ’re nothing but overgrown babies . If they do n’t have a woman around to cook for them and coo at them and tell them what to do , they ’re lost . But I do n’t think it ’s Dominic you need advice about . ”
98590	98620	98621	98621	Her	183	“ You ’re a smart girl , and your love life is none of my business . So I ’ll say this , then I ’ll say no more . ”
98634	98668	98630	98630	She	183	“ The egg does not swim to the sperm . Never chase a man . It goes against nature . If you want him , let him chase you until you catch him . ”
98687	98707	98708	98708	She	183	“ And no more sex in the dressing rooms . Who do you think has to clean in there ? ”
98719	98741	98708	98708	She	183	“ If you want to meet a good man , read a book ! Now let ’s get back to work ! ”
98821	98826	98827	98827	I	0	“ The plot thickens , ”
99102	99107	99108	99108	I	0	“ It ’s stealing , ”
99225	99235	99217	99217	He	96	“ Hello , tesoro . How are you feeling ? ”
99249	99268	99243	99243	I	0	“ I have to ask you something , and I need you to be completely honest with me . ”
99277	99283	99274	99274	Dominic	96	“ Of course . Anything . ”
99284	99294	99274	99274	Dominic	96	“ How much money did my father lend you ? ”
99337	99361	99362	99362	He	96	“ Your father never lent me money ! Where did you get such an idea ? Did that horrible woman tell you that ? ”
99411	99420	99421	99421	I	0	“ I found a ledger my father kept . ”
99457	99466	99454	99454	he	96	“ I do n’t know anything about that . ”
99494	99515	99519	99519	Dominic	96	“ That ’s very interesting because there ’s a lot of information here about dates , loan amounts . . . ”
99572	99590	99558	99558	he	96	“ There might have been a few times I needed help here and there over the years . ”
99591	99596	99597	99597	I	0	“ How many times ? ”
99605	99614	99597	99597	I	0	“ How much money did he give you ? ”

99677	99709	99673	99673	He	96	“ This was between your father and me , Kimberly . It ’s no business of yours . And it ’s disrespectful of you to ask me . Your poor father — ”
99710	99742	99743	99743	He	96	“ Do n’t you dare talk to me about my ‘ poor ’ father , or about disrespect ! Not even two minutes ago you lied about never getting any money ! ”
99746	99755	99743	99743	He	96	“ It ’s beneath me to speak of . ”
99800	99812	99900	99900	he	1835	“ The Cast - off Couturier Goes on a Murder Spree ! ”
99813	99836	99900	99900	he	1835	“ You ’re stonewalling me now ? Then I guess you wo n’t want to talk about your relationship with the marchesa . ”
99844	99852	99900	99900	he	1835	“ She has poisoned you against me . ”
99853	99859	99900	99900	he	1835	“ Are you denying it ? ”
99860	99869	99900	99900	he	1835	“ Whatever she told you is a lie . ”
99870	99886	99900	99900	he	1835	“ Okay , then answer me this : Why did you say Matteo was vicious ? ”
99907	99944	99900	99900	he	1835	“ He would n’t allow me to attend the wedding . I tried to go , but he blocked me at the door . He threatened to rip off my head . He ’s an animal . ”
99981	100017	100018	100018	Dominic	96	“ At the hospital , you told me you were n’t invited to the wedding . That no one attended . That it was done in secret . This sounds like a much different story . ”
100036	100147	100020	100020	he	96	“ Your father and I were friends for fifty years ! I was the only one who came to the hospital when he was sick ! I was the only one who stood by him after your mother died and he fell into the bottom of a bottle for so long you had to be sent away to live with your aunt in the States ! I was the one who cared for him during his depression and made sure he ate , and showered , and his business did n’t go under ! Me ! If anything , I deserved the money he gave me ! I earned it ! ”

100330	100350	100317	100317	I	0	“ I wondered if I could speak to you for a minute . If we could have a chat . ”
100368	100380	100387	100387	she	1840	“ Of course . I ’m happy to talk to you . ”
100390	100397	100387	100387	she	1840	“ I ’m glad you called . ”

100519	100529	100500	100500	she	1840	“ You ’re sure I ’m not disturbing you ? ”
100530	100555	100500	100500	she	1840	“ I ’ve just finished supper , and Lorenzo left a few minutes ago to walk the dogs . This is a good time . ”
100563	100569	100500	100500	she	1840	“ Where does Lorenzo sleep ? ”
100591	100597	100579	100579	I	0	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
100610	100618	100579	100579	I	0	“ Are you and Lorenzo a couple ? ”
100624	100640	100619	100619	Her	1840	“ If we were , his wife would certainly have something to say about it ! ”
100645	100651	100619	100619	Her	1840	“ Wife ? What wife ? ”
100652	100742	100743	100743	I	0	“ His quite lovely wife of almost forty years , Barbara . She ’s a darling woman , but if she believed for one moment I had designs on her husband , I ’d be missing my teeth . She ’s German . You should see her arms . The woman could pass for a professional wrestler . They live close to Il Sogno — it ’s the white cottage with the blue door at the bottom of the hill next to the bakery . You ’ve seen it ? ”
100760	100822	100823	100823	She	1845	“ Barbara works the night shift , which is why Lorenzo often stays late . Or comes early , depending how you look at it . And to answer your question directly : no . Lorenzo and I are not romantically involved . He is one of my truest friends , however . He ’s seen me through many difficult times . ”
100834	100887	100823	100823	She	1845	“ Barbara arrives tomorrow on the train . It ’s our annual tradition , a little holiday for all of us . I can get on quite well with the service in the hotel , and Lorenzo and Barbara take in the sights . Milan is so beautiful this time of year . ”
100941	100974	100925	100925	I	0	“ I hope I get to meet her soon . I ’m sorry I had to ask you that . I do n’t mean to be disrespectful , it ’s just that — ”
100975	100987	100988	100988	she	1845	“ It ’s just that Dominic has been in your ear , ”
100996	100999	100988	100988	she	1845	“ Yes . ”
101030	101060	101066	101066	her	1845	“ I wondered how long it would take him . Is there anything else you ’d like to ask me ? Since we ’re having such a nice chat . ”
101084	101099	101076	101076	She	1845	“ Now that you mention it , I do have a few more questions . ”
101100	101105	101106	101106	I	0	“ I ’m listening . ”
101138	101153	101123	101123	I	0	“ Why did n’t you come to the hospital when my father was sick ? ”
101154	101157	101158	101158	she	1845	“ Oh , ”
101162	101172	101158	101158	she	1845	“ I see you ’ve brought the big guns . ”
101173	101181	101123	101123	I	0	“ I ’m terrible with small talk . ”
101182	101185	101186	101186	She	1845	“ Evidently . ”
101192	101274	101275	101275	She	1845	“ My first husband suffered for more than two years before the cancer finally killed him . We were constantly in and out of the hospital . Everything in our lives revolved around him being sick . I ’m not complaining , you understand , just explaining that was our reality . Waiting for him to die . Watching him get weaker and sicker . The helplessness I felt at not being able to do anything to stop it . . . ”
101307	101381	101295	101295	Her	1845	“ When I married your father , he vowed I ’d never go through anything like that with him . He extracted a promise from me that if he were ever to fall sick and have to be hospitalized , I would stay away . I refused at first , but when he said it would be easier on him , not having to watch me watch him waste away , I agreed . ”
101390	101434	101382	101382	Her	1845	“ Since we ’re being so open , I have to tell you it was the hardest thing I ’ve ever done . It nearly killed me to stay away , but that ’s what he wanted . So I honored my promise . ”
101435	101444	101445	101445	I	0	“ And I yelled at you for it , ”
101458	101469	101453	101453	Her	1845	“ Oh , my dear . You did n’t know . ”
101470	101477	101478	101478	I	0	“ I nicknamed you the WS , ”

101497	101514	101494	101494	She	1845	“ That ’s rather clever , is n’t it ? I do enjoy a good nickname . ”
101521	101542	101518	101518	She	1845	“ You ’ll be wanting to know about Matteo , of course . He ’s dreadfully in love with you . ”
101560	101563	101553	101553	I	0	“ Uh — ”
101564	101595	101596	101596	She	1845	“ It ’s been giving me such delight watching him try to manage it . He does n’t wear his heart on his sleeve , as you no doubt know . ”
101600	101611	101596	101596	She	1845	“ That runs in the family , I ’m afraid . ”
101633	101686	101687	101687	She	1845	“ When you came in the other night at dinner , he was asking my advice on how to court you . Is n’t that sweet ? So old - fashioned . You would n’t think it to look at him , but he really does n’t have much luck with women . ”
101690	101727	101687	101687	She	1845	“ Always trying to be so macho . He ’s like his father that way . Ca n’t stand to be seen as weak . The ego ! Ha ! It ’s their Achilles ’ heel . ”
101784	101811	101812	101812	She	1851	“ Speaking of ego , he ’s also terribly vain . Terribly . His morning routine takes a lifetime . The hair products alone . . . ”
101827	101869	101812	101812	She	1851	“ He told me about Maria . About how you always had to have a Great Dane in the house so he would never forget how he refused to come in and see his father on his sickbed before he died . ”
101894	101930	101931	101931	I	0	“ That ’s what he thinks ? That I was punishing him ? I thought it would comfort him to have the same breed as Maria around . He and that dog were so close . ”
101934	101938	101931	101931	I	0	“ Oh crap . ”

101973	101978	101961	101961	I	0	“ One last question . ”
101979	101982	101931	101931	I	0	“ Yes ? ”

102021	102028	102029	102029	She	2402	“ Why would you do that ? ”
102033	102113	102029	102029	She	2402	“ Because you ’d never had a mother , and I ’d never had a daughter . I thought . . . it ’s silly , I know , but I thought we could both get what we ’d always been missing at the same time . You ’d arrive after your honeymoon and we ’d meet , and we ’d all be one big happy family . I had a big party planned . Like a surprise party . ”
102119	102131	102114	102114	Her	2402	“ I ’m sorry , it all seems so stupid now . ”
102173	102195	102196	102196	Her	2402	“ It ’s not stupid . It ’s lovely . I ’m sorry it did n’t work out like you wanted . ”
102203	102220	102196	102196	Her	2402	“ That ’s life , I ’m afraid . It keeps interrupting all our wonderful plans . ”
102221	102231	102196	102196	Her	2402	“ I think I owe Matteo a big apology . ”
102232	102241	102196	102196	Her	2402	“ Why ? Did you insult his hair ? ”
102242	102253	102254	102254	She	2402	“ It ’s worse than that , I ’m afraid . ”
102258	102282	102254	102254	She	2402	“ Just compliment his hair . It goes a long way , believe me . Anything else can be solved with a kiss . ”

103102	103115	103116	103116	I	0	“ Hey ! You did n’t force anything on me , pal ! ”
103120	103172	103116	103116	I	0	“ Do n’t paint yourself as the bad guy ! And do n’t paint me as some damsel in distress without any choice in the matter ! What happened in the dressing room happened because we both wanted it . And all those kisses happened because we both wanted them to . ”
103173	103179	103180	103180	he	108	“ I was blackmailing you , ”
103186	103226	103180	103180	he	108	“ Yeah , you were ! Newsflash — I loved every second of it ! If I did n’t , you ’d have two black eyes and an empty hole between your legs where your dick used to be ! ”
103237	103265	103232	103232	I	0	“ Do n’t you dare chicken out on me now , Moretti . I will be so mad at you if you chicken out on me now . ”
103266	103277	103278	103278	he	108	“ Calling me poultry is n’t going to help anything , ”
103284	103297	103278	103278	he	108	“ I ’ll call you a goddamn wet noodle if I want ! ”
103305	103309	103302	103302	He	108	“ That mouth , ”

103548	103586	103527	103527	him	108	“ It ’s nothing much . Just an existential crisis that will undoubtedly leave some major scars on my heart , my psyche , and my ability to successfully interact with the rest of the human race . ”
103587	103602	103527	103527	him	108	“ Good luck with that . What ’re you eating ? It sounds good . ”
103603	103613	103614	103614	I	0	“ You ’re as empathetic as a dirt clod , ”

103705	103727	103692	103692	Brad	60	“ Because the reason I wanted to do it in the first place no longer exists . Why do you care ? ”
103739	103771	103736	103736	he	1867	“ Because . . . it ’s how I ’m supposed to be making it up to you . About the ditching - you - at - the - altar thing . ”
103772	103788	103789	103789	I	0	“ I ’m aware of why you ’re supposed to be making amends to me , ”

103813	103824	103825	103825	I	0	“ Fine . I had someone I wanted to invite . ”
103828	103855	103825	103825	I	0	“ Your mother was going to fly all the way to Italy to watch you in a fashion show ? I thought she only wanted pictures . ”
103856	103862	103863	103863	I	0	“ It ’s someone else . ”

103927	103947	103825	103825	I	0	“ Do n’t act so scandalized ! I ’m not the only one with a new boyfriend , girlfriend ! ”
103955	103974	103952	103952	I	0	“ Good point . And if you ever call me girlfriend again , I ’ll rebreak your nose . ”
103990	104001	103987	103987	Brad	60	“ You let Jenner call you girlfriend all the time . ”
104002	104016	104017	104017	My	0	“ Dig that hole any deeper and I ’ll bury you in it . ”

104071	104089	104060	104060	I	0	“ We were never together in the first place . But now we ’re really not together . ”
104090	104105	104106	104106	He	1868	“ Oh , well , that makes perfect sense . Thanks for the explanation . ”
104114	104131	104132	104132	Brad	60	“ Not that I owe you an explanation , but . . . it ’s complicated . ”
104135	104145	104132	104132	Brad	60	“ You farted in bed , did n’t you ? ”
104146	104152	104153	104153	I	0	“ That happened one time ! ”
104156	104168	104153	104153	I	0	“ And you promised you ’d never bring it up again ! ”
104172	104221	104169	104169	He	1868	“ You know you should n’t eat beans , Kimber . You ca n’t digest them . If I were a weaker man , I ’d be dead right now . That fart was , like , killer . It took months for my nose hair to regrow . ”
104222	104228	104229	104229	I	0	“ This is n’t happening . ”
104239	104278	104229	104229	I	0	“ I ’m not having this conversation right now . I ’m somewhere in a locked room with padded walls , wearing a nice comfy straitjacket , having a respectable mental breakdown . This is not my life . ”
104279	104294	104299	104299	Brad	60	“ I ’m gon na call you right back . Do n’t go anywhere . ”
104350	104366	104346	104348	an efficient secretary	1871	“ I ’ve got Jenner and Danielle on the line . I conferenced them in . ”

104376	104379	104381	104381	Danielle	65	“ Honey , ”
104386	104394	104381	104381	Danielle	65	“ Brad said you ’re in trouble — ”
104395	104398	104400	104400	Jenner	58	“ Poppins ? ”
104402	104413	104400	104400	Jenner	58	“ What ’s all this about ? Are you okay ? ”
104466	104479	104463	104463	Jenner	58	“ I do n’t understand why you ’re calling us , though . ”
104483	104497	104480	104480	Brad	60	“ She ’s my best friend . I want her to be happy . ”
104512	104544	104509	104509	I	0	“ I think there ’s a small piece of information the rest of the group is missing , Brad . Up to you if you want to share it or not . ”
104545	104552	104553	104553	He	1874	“ You did n’t tell them ? ”
104565	104575	104562	104562	his	1874	“ Not my place . Already told you that . ”
104576	104581	104582	104582	he	1874	“ Not even Jenner ? ”
104589	104593	104595	104595	Jenner	58	“ Excuse me , ”
104598	104608	104609	104609	Brad	60	“ but what the bloody hell is going on ? ”
104612	104621	104609	104609	Brad	60	“ Um . I , um . . . ”
104632	104637	104622	104622	He	1874	“ You tell them . ”
104655	104674	104675	104675	Danielle	65	“ So , do you guys remember where Brad and I were going to go on our honeymoon ? ”
104678	104683	104684	104684	Jenner	58	“ The dude ranch ? ”
104687	104692	104684	104684	Jenner	58	“ What about it ? ”
104693	104720	104743	104743	Brad	60	“ Two things . The first is that it ’s where Brad wanted to go . The second is that it ’s a. Dude . Ranch . ”
104736	104739	104732	104732	Jenner	58	“ No . ”
104747	104750	104743	104743	Brad	60	“ Yeah . ”
104758	104763	104755	104755	Danielle	65	“ What ’s happening ? ”
104772	104789	104764	104764	Jenner	58	“ If I ’m not mistaken , what ’s happening is that Brad just came out . ”
104790	104797	104834	104834	Danielle	65	“ Came out ? Of where ? ”
104798	104812	104814	104814	Jenner	58	“ For God ’s sake , what has Ohio done to your brain ? ”
104818	104829	104834	104834	Danielle	65	“ Excuse me for not being able to read minds , ”
104836	104850	104834	104834	Danielle	65	“ And I ’ll have you know , Ohio is a wonderful place ! ”
104851	104866	104868	104868	Brad	60	“ I do n’t know , I might be with Jenner on this one , ”
104873	104893	104868	104868	Brad	60	“ I went to Cleveland once and almost got mugged outside a church at ten o’clock in the morning . ”
104910	104917	104918	104918	She	65	“ Brad is gay , Danielle . ”
104935	104956	104957	104957	Danielle	65	“ It ’s true . I ’m gay . That ’s why I could n’t go through with the wedding . ”
104966	104974	104957	104957	Danielle	65	“ Gay ? I do n’t understand . ”
104975	104984	104985	104985	I	0	“ That was my exact reaction , too . ”
104999	105009	105011	105011	Jenner	58	“ I ’m surprised I did n’t see it , ”
105013	105031	105011	105011	Jenner	58	“ but I ’m glad you pulled the plug on the wedding , for both your sakes . ”
105036	105049	105032	105032	His	58	“ We ’ll talk about how you should ’ve handled that later . ”
105050	105066	105067	105067	I	0	“ I appreciate the support , but I ’ve already put him through the wringer . ”
105087	105096	105083	105083	Nebbiolo	203	“ Besides , what ’s done is done . ”
105097	105100	105102	105102	Brad	60	“ Right ! ”
105107	105124	105125	105125	Danielle	65	“ What we need to concentrate on now is getting her back together with her stepbrother ! ”
105128	105138	105125	105125	Danielle	65	“ This is the strangest phone call in history . ”
105139	105157	105159	105159	Jenner	58	“ We ’re going to need the full backstory if you want us to be any help , ”
105208	105212	105213	105213	Brad	60	“ Hold on , ”
105216	105239	105213	105213	Brad	60	“ You were gon na make me wear a dress ? When were you gon na get around to telling me that ? ”
105240	105257	105258	105258	I	0	“ At about the same time you got around to telling me the wedding was off , ”
105262	105301	105258	105258	I	0	“ Because there ’s nothing quite like being humiliated in front of hundreds of people while wearing a couture gown handmade for the occasion . You did say you ’d do anything to make it up to me . ”
105307	105333	105334	105334	Jenner	58	“ Let ’s cut to the chase , shall we ? How do you feel about him ? Are you in love with this man ? ”
105341	105373	105334	105334	Jenner	58	“ It would be ridiculous , would n’t it ? So soon after meeting him ? So soon after my relationship with Brad ending ? So soon . . . period ? ”
105374	105381	105454	105454	his	58	“ That ’s not an answer . ”
105382	105391	105393	105393	Danielle	65	“ It would be romantic , not ridiculous , ”
105395	105423	105393	105393	Danielle	65	“ I knew as soon as I met Brian that he was the one . Took one look — boom . And your kids would be gorgeous . ”
105424	105435	105436	105436	Brad	60	“ Whoa ! No one ’s talking about having kids . ”
105439	105450	105436	105436	Brad	60	“ She ’s right . Your kids would be gorgeous . ”
105457	105462	105451	105451	Jenner	58	“ Ugh . Breeders . ”
105463	105484	105393	105393	Danielle	65	“ Can we move on from the kid talk and the love talk ? What am I supposed to do ? ”
105485	105516	105454	105454	his	58	“ Get your head straight and figure out how you feel . It ’s not right to pursue him because you ’re lonely , or because Satan bruised your ego . ”
105517	105520	105522	105522	Brad	60	“ Hey , ”
105526	105533	105522	105522	Brad	60	“ Did you nickname me Satan ? ”
105534	105548	105550	105550	Danielle	65	“ Yes , and it ’s an insult to the lord of darkness , ”
105552	105556	105558	105558	Jenner	58	“ I think , ”
105563	105621	105558	105558	Jenner	58	“ you should do exactly as Matteo suggested and take some time . You ’ve endured some of the most traumatic things that can happen to a person , all within the space of a month . You ended a significant relationship . Your father died . You moved to another country . Your business burned down — ”
105622	105628	105630	105630	Brad	60	“ Your business burned down ? ”
105648	105654	105656	105656	Jenner	58	“ As I was saying , ”
105658	105699	105656	105656	Jenner	58	“ Even if it were possible for you to know without a doubt how you feel right now , it ’s impossible to begin a relationship that has any chance of lasting during such a chaotic time in your life . ”
105838	105847	105848	105848	Everyone	2190	“ I have to dig in my heels . ”
105851	105854	105848	105848	Everyone	2190	“ What ? ”
105855	105900	105848	105848	Everyone	2190	“ It ’s a long story . Listen — I love you guys . Thank you so much for worrying about me , and thank you for being my friends . But I think I know what I need to do . And Brad ? ”
105901	105904	105977	105977	Matteo	108	“ Yeah ? ”
105905	105924	105848	105848	Everyone	2190	“ You ’re not totally off the hook , but making this phone call goes a long way . ”
105929	105932	105933	105933	he	1883	“ Thanks , ”
105937	105943	105933	105933	he	1883	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
105944	105958	105959	105959	I	0	“ Um . . . I sorta liked the idea of the dress . ”
106036	106039	106029	106029	I	0	“ Answer . ”
106040	106045	106091	106091	her	1884	“ It ’s you . ”
106046	106057	106091	106091	her	1884	“ It ’s me . Please do n’t hang up . ”
106058	106065	106029	106029	I	0	“ I was n’t going to . ”
106066	106084	106091	106091	her	1884	“ Good . Because I need to say important things , and I need you to listen . ”
106114	106120	106094	106094	I	0	“ Have you been drinking ? ”
106121	106124	106125	106125	She	1884	“ Yes ! ”
106134	106151	106125	106125	She	1884	“ But not because I needed liquid courage to call you . Because I was depressed . ”
106180	106186	106158	106158	I	0	“ Are you still there ? ”
106187	106192	106193	106193	I	0	“ I ’m here . ”
106198	106211	106195	106195	my	0	“ And I do n’t like the idea of you drinking alone . ”
106212	106322	106323	106323	She	1887	“ Cut me some slack , Count . It ’s not every day I get dumped by the man of my dreams . And before you ask , no , I did n’t get drunk after Brad left me at the altar , and no , he was n’t the man of my dreams . He was a fantasy I made up in my head who ticked off a bunch of boxes that did n’t matter because they were n’t real . You ’re real . You ’re what I was looking for all along , only I was too busy dealing with all my disasters to realize it . ”
106329	106359	106323	106323	She	1887	“ Though I have to admit that you ’re incredibly irritating when you want to be . I ’ve never met anyone who can do smug better than you . ”
106408	106417	106418	106418	She	1887	“ I ’ve had a lot of practice . ”
106431	106445	106418	106418	She	1887	“ You get a gold star for effort , that ’s for sure . ”
106518	106558	106506	106506	I	0	“ M’kay , you ’re doing your silent smoldering thing , so I ’m just gon na go ahead and talk , and you can be over there all broody and non - sharey to your heart ’s content . ”
106559	106568	106569	106569	I	0	“ Exactly how much alcohol did you drink ? ”
106574	106579	106569	106569	I	0	“ I want you . ”
106625	106662	106615	106615	I	0	“ I want you because you ’re smart , and you ’re funny , and you ’re talented , and you respect your mother , and you make me feel capable of murder , and flight . ”
106663	106666	106580	106580	She	1887	“ Flight ? ”
106667	106695	106700	106700	you	1887	“ When you kiss me , I feel like I grow wings . It ’s a cliché , but it ’s true , so bear with me . ”
106703	106745	106700	106700	you	1887	“ I want you because I ’ve never met anyone who challenges me like you do . Who looks at me like you do . Who makes my heart stop beating the way you do when you walk into a room . ”
106787	106795	106784	106784	she	1887	“ Also , your hair is incredible . ”
106804	106813	106797	106797	I	0	“ You ’ve been talking to my mother . ”
106814	106820	106784	106784	she	1887	“ I really like her . ”

107053	107080	107049	107049	she	1887	“ What I need is to kiss you and apologize and tell you all about how I was plotting to crash your show at Fashion Week . ”
107092	107099	107100	107100	she	1887	“ Yeah , it was dumb , ”
107110	107179	107100	107100	she	1887	“ I was gon na make Brad wear a really pretty dress I ’ve been working on — hopefully Jenner and some of his model friends , too , but he was n’t on board yet — and get up on the catwalk with a sign around his neck that read Moretti Sucks Balls . Or something like that . I had n’t exactly figured it out yet . “
107224	107232	107235	107235	Jenner	58	” She ’s got me completely confused . “

107349	107398	107280	107280	Brad	60	” Now she ’s telling me he was willing to completely humiliate himself in public to make amends for how he humiliated her . The son of a bitch is still trying to get her back . I should ’ve broken his legs when I had the chance . “

107468	107599	107463	107463	I	0	” she says , attempting to sound sober . It would ’ve been a passable attempt , too , except for the burp at the end . Even that is adorable . More proof that I ’m totally gone for this woman . That I ’m doing the right thing by staying away . The last thing she needs is another man muddying the waters . She has to decide what she wants for herself . In time . When she ’s sober . Since she brought up Fashion Week and the show , I ’m tempted to tell her about my own plan , but decide now is n’t the time . Besides , I want it to be a surprise . That was my intent from the beginning . “

I swipe my car keys from the dresser and head out , growling under my breath . When she wakes up in the morning , she ’s going to have worse things than a hangover to deal with .

108485	108544	108476	108476	I	0	“ But I ’m crazy about the bear , and I do n’t like it when he does n’t want to be around me , so I have to chase after him with a stick and poke him until he pays attention to me again . Even though the egg is n’t supposed to chase after the sperm . ”

But if you do n’t think this is going anywhere , I need to know . I meant what I said yesterday . I ca n’t be a rebound . For anyone else , yes , but not for you . ”

115127	115131	115132	115132	he	58	“ Of course , ”
115136	115170	115132	115132	he	58	“ But only because I ’m frightened you ’ll clobber me . I was there when you rearranged Satan ’s nose , if you recall . How is he , by the way ? ”
115171	115183	115041	115041	his	58	“ Still gay . And in love with someone named Giancarlo . ”

115191	115223	115189	115189	Jenner	58	“ How delicious . I think I ’m in love with him , too . Pity I ’ll never meet him . I could avenge your honor by breaking them up . ”
115224	115289	115041	115041	his	58	“ Oh , you ’ll probably meet him . Brad has decided he ’s moving to Florence to be with the new boy toy . And he ’s hanging on to me like a bad head cold . I ’m sure if I told him I was going to Milan for the show , he and Gio would be on the next train out . ”
115297	115309	115294	115294	Jenner	58	“ Well , no one can say your life is boring . ”

115364	115392	115393	115393	He	58	“ It turns out she is n’t so wicked . God , I have a lot to catch you up on . When can I see you ? ”
115549	115553	115539	115539	him	108	“ Stop fidgeting . ”

115831	115842	115843	115843	He	58	“ Walking ? I already know how to do that ! ”
115850	115870	115843	115843	He	58	“ When wearing couture , one does n’t simply stomp around as if mashing grapes underfoot . One glides . ”
115899	115936	115871	115871	He	58	“ I ’ll never be able to copy that , catwalk boy . And thanks for that ego - boosting description of how I move . It was just the shot in the arm I needed . ”
115948	115970	115943	115943	he	58	“ Oh , Poppins . I tease . Your walk is lovely . I ’m only trying to loosen you up . ”
115971	115994	115871	115871	He	58	“ Please , no more loosening . It ’s having the opposite effect . I ’m wound so tight I might snap . ”
115995	115999	116000	116000	he	58	“ I know , ”
116014	116051	116000	116000	he	58	“ It all feels a bit déjà vu , does n’t it ? The last time we were in a room together prepping you for a big event , it did n’t end quite as planned . ”
116052	116063	116064	116064	I	0	“ Hopefully this time will be different . Knock wood . ”
116076	116089	116064	116064	I	0	“ Very funny . At least you ’re not carrying calla lilies . ”
116090	116100	116000	116000	he	58	“ That reminds me . Where ’s my clutch ? ”
116101	116104	116105	116105	He	58	“ Here . ”
116120	116129	116105	116105	He	58	“ What ’s in this thing ? Rocks ? ”
116130	116158	116159	116159	He	58	“ Lip gloss , my phone , and a giant stack of business cards . If all goes well I ’ll be handing them out like candy . ”
116162	116178	116159	116159	He	58	“ I love it that you ’re going into this with such an entrepreneurial spirit . ”
116199	116231	116232	116232	I	0	“ It would be smarter if I were going into it with a belly full of Xanax . God , this is worse than the wedding . My nerves are shot ! ”
116247	116259	116244	116244	Jenner	58	“ You really have feelings for him , do n’t you ? ”
116264	116287	116244	116244	Jenner	58	“ Turns out that old adage ‘ Absence makes the heart grow fonder ’ is true . I just wish . . . ”
116298	116301	116295	116295	Jenner	58	“ What ? ”
116312	116320	116302	116302	I	0	“ I wish it could be easier . ”
116321	116324	116295	116295	Jenner	58	“ It ? ”
116325	116342	116343	116343	He	58	“ Love . Relationships . Why does it all have to be so confusing and convoluted ? ”
116353	116425	116343	116343	He	58	“ Because real life is n’t a fairy tale , darling , and making a relationship last is hard . Love involves a lot of forgiveness . People are n’t perfect . Falling in love is easy , but staying in love is a choice . You have to decide if the ups and downs are worth sticking out because there will be plenty of them . There will be pain . “
116530	116547	116552	116563	the last person in the world I would ’ve expected that from	1965	” I stare at him , blinking back tears so I do n’t ruin my mascara . “
116565	116584	116552	116563	the last person in the world I would ’ve expected that from	1965	” He swallows hard , looking away . When he speaks , his voice is low and rough . “
116610	116664	116666	116666	you	0	” I ’m shocked by that . Ten years I ’ve known this man , and this is the first time I ’ve glimpsed the lovelorn side of him . Apparently his revolving door of partners started after a heartbreak so big he could n’t come back from it . I ask gently , “
116674	116690	116666	116666	you	0	” He draws himself up , tosses his head , and forces a bright smile . “
116721	116722	116714	116714	I	0	” “

124225	124237	124212	124212	He	58	“ Yes , I would have . But here we are . ”
124238	124243	124244	124244	I	0	“ Here we are . ”
124253	124268	124244	124244	I	0	“ Who knew you had a real heart hidden away under all that tin ? ”
124269	124272	124273	124273	he	58	“ Tundra , ”
124277	124294	124273	124273	he	58	“ And do n’t get cheeky with me , darling . It ’s my wedding day . ”
124295	124335	124244	124244	I	0	“ I ’ll get as cheeky as I want , my friend , considering if I ’d never broken three - quarters of the bones in my limbs , you ’d never have met the man of your dreams . ”
124336	124339	124340	124340	He	58	“ True . ”
124345	124358	124340	124340	He	58	“ But a nurse . I could n’t even land a doctor ? ”
124359	124367	124368	124368	I	0	“ The heart wants what it wants , ”
124375	124380	124368	124368	I	0	“ Indeed it does . ”
124388	124402	124381	124381	He	58	“ Oh , Poppins . This is the happiest day of my life . ”
124413	124433	124403	124403	He	58	“ If Toni stops the ceremony to announce he ’s straight , I expect you to break his nose ! ”
124513	124518	124519	124519	I	0	“ Are you ready ? ”
124522	124527	124519	124519	I	0	“ I ’m ready . ”
124528	124538	124494	124494	Jenner	58	“ Chin up . Back straight . Tits out . ”
124539	124551	124552	124552	he	58	“ God , you ’ve got a memory like an elephant , ”
124684	124688	124682	124682	Pachelbel	68	“ Canon in D. ”
124712	124728	124709	124709	Jenner	58	“ That ghastly song . We can never get away from it , can we ? ”
124729	124748	124749	124749	Jenner	58	“ If I ever get married again , I ’ll strangle the musician who dares to play it . ”
125091	125103	125088	125088	he	108	“ How soon can we get you out of this dress ? ”
125107	125116	125088	125088	he	108	“ Weddings make you horny , do they ? ”
125117	125123	125124	125124	He	108	“ You make me horny . ”
125149	125151	125124	125124	He	108	“ lick ”
125153	125155	125124	125124	He	108	“ forever ”
125218	125262	125211	125211	He	100	“ You ’ll have to keep it in your pants until after the toasts , hot stuff . I ’ve got the best man speech to give . Maybe we can have a quickie in the bathroom between that and the first dance . ”
125263	125272	125273	125273	he	108	“ You know I do n’t do quickies , ”
125299	125311	125314	125315	the marchesa	2402	“ Hey , lovebirds , are you coming inside or what ? ”
125374	125381	125384	125384	them	1116	“ Yes , we ’re coming . ”
125470	125480	125482	125482	Matteo	108	“ You ’re a better person than I am , ”
125490	125504	125482	125482	Matteo	108	“ I never would ’ve forgiven him for taking money from your father . ”
125519	125568	125569	125569	Matteo	108	“ Though it ’s my personal specialty , grudges are n’t something Papa believed in . I know he would ’ve wanted me to work it out . And Dominic did apologize and offer to pay the money back , so he got credit for making an effort . ”
125573	125597	125569	125569	Matteo	108	“ Until he apologizes to my mother for the way he ’s treated her , he ’ll always be on my shit list . ”
125606	125617	125618	125618	He	108	“ Why do you think I invited him , Count ? ”
125625	125635	125618	125618	He	108	“ What is it you have against my title ? ”
125651	125670	125641	125641	I	0	“ Nothing at all . I just love how much it annoys you when I call you Count . ”
125671	125687	125689	125689	his	108	“ So it ’s not that you ’d rather be a countess than Marchesa Moretti . ”
125718	125729	125709	125709	I	0	“ I think someone already has dibs on that title . ”
125730	125745	125746	125746	he	108	“ And I think it ’s time we had another marchesa in the family , ”
125779	125790	125770	125770	he	108	“ Uh . . . I , uh . . . ”
125791	125798	125799	125799	he	108	“ You ‘ uh ’ what ? ”
125809	125823	125799	125799	he	108	“ You ‘ uh ’ want to see the ring before you decide ? ”
125824	125828	125829	125829	I	0	“ The ring ? ”
125860	125877	125878	125878	He	108	“ Unless you ’d rather not . I know you ’re not that keen about matrimony . ”
125881	125891	125878	125878	He	108	“ It ’s pretty nice , though . Big . ”
125933	125937	125927	125927	I	0	“ How big ? ”
125938	125941	125942	125942	He	108	“ Massive . ”
125948	125989	125942	125942	He	108	“ Now that I think about it , it ’s completely gaudy . You would n’t want to wear it anyway . Diamonds that large only attract the wrong kind of attention . People will think you ’re showing off . ”
125996	126082	125990	125990	He	108	“ You ’d probably be a target for muggers . You would n’t be able to wear it in public , that ’s for sure . Just around the house . No , maybe not even there — the servants would talk , someone would plan a theft . I suppose you ’d have to keep the thing locked up in a safe where the light of all those flawless carats can shine without the threat of being stolen . Hey , should we dance ? ”
126083	126092	126093	126093	I	0	“ Where is this horrible , gaudy ring ? ”
126108	126120	126098	126098	I	0	“ Show it to me now or I ’ll kill you ! ”
126143	126152	126121	126121	He	108	“ It ’s in my pocket , bella . ”
126160	126176	126153	126153	I	0	“ And here I thought all this time you were just happy to see me . ”
126239	126242	126243	126243	I	0	“ Jesus , ”
126253	126285	126243	126243	I	0	“ That is gaudy . Tell me it ’s cubic zirconia , I do n’t want to think you had to put the castle in hock to buy that awful thing . ”
126286	126291	126292	126292	he	108	“ I love you , ”
126302	126308	126292	126292	he	108	“ Will you marry me ? ”
126318	126334	126292	126292	he	108	“ I can hardly say no after you bought me the world ’s biggest diamond . ”
126335	126340	126341	126341	he	108	“ My plan exactly , ”
126346	126355	126341	126341	he	108	“ But that was n’t officially a yes . ”
126385	126388	126389	126389	I	0	“ Yes , ”
126396	126409	126389	126389	I	0	“ Officially , yes . I love you with all my heart . ”
126410	126420	126458	126458	he	108	“ It ’s the hair , is n’t it ? ”
126421	126428	126458	126458	he	108	“ Shut up and kiss me . ”
126429	126436	126389	126389	I	0	“ God , you ’re bossy . ”
126437	126451	126452	126452	We	2163	“ No , I ’m just really good at digging in my heels . ”
