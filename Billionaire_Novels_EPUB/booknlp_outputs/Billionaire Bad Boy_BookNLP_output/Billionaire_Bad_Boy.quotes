31	36	38	45	the spiky - haired kid on the TV	113	" You 're boring , "
98	101	102	102	she	46	" Boring ? "
228	235	217	217	she	46	" What do you mean boring ? "
335	351	352	354	Dug - E	48	" Yeah , you heard me . You 're all as dull as , as ... "
372	378	358	358	his	48	" ... as my mother . "
390	396	398	399	Bob Horton	47	" Hello , Mrs. Douglas , "
407	414	398	399	Bob Horton	47	" Nice to see you again . "
480	487	488	489	Mrs. Douglas	49	" You must forgive my son , "
492	499	488	489	Mrs. Douglas	49	" But he has a point . "
500	504	505	505	Bob	47	" A point ? "
508	516	517	517	she	130	" Yes , a very valid point , "
535	592	593	593	she	130	" He 's a young , up - and - coming artist , Mr. Horton . He needs freedom to express his personality through his music , and his life outside of music . He feels — we both feel — that a younger , more hip agent would understand him better . I do apologize , "
597	610	593	593	she	130	" But we feel Douglas 's talent should be nurtured not stifled . "
644	652	653	653	Bob	47	" Right , er , of course , "
656	673	653	653	Bob	47	" That 's a real shame , though . We have some great ideas for him . "
683	693	694	694	she	46	" You 're not giving up yet are you ? "
702	707	694	694	she	46	" Just like that ? "
708	720	721	721	he	47	" He 's not interested , Annie , let it go , "
762	768	769	769	she	49	" What did you say ? "
986	990	991	991	Bob	47	" We understand , "
1093	1122	1123	1123	He	47	" I was saying that we have the perfect agent for your son , Mrs. Douglas . She 's young , she's ... er , hip and wired . "
1129	1156	1123	1123	He	47	" Yeah , wired . We think she 'd be perfect for your son . She knows all the happening places . All the cool gigs . "
1178	1185	1170	1170	she	46	" Well , where is she ? "
1235	1239	1231	1231	Bob	47	" Right here . "
1254	1263	1240	1240	He	47	" Um , Bob , can we talk — "
1264	1267	1268	1268	he	47	" Later , "
1289	1293	1294	1294	Bob	47	" Annie McCallum , "
1314	1319	1320	1320	She	46	" Nup . Boring . "
1374	1386	1387	1387	Bob	47	" She 's very far from boring , Dug - E , "
1495	1502	1503	1503	he	169	" She 's wearing a suit , "
1506	1522	1503	1503	he	169	" Er , that 's only because we make her wear one in the office . "
1528	1563	1523	1523	Bob	47	" She 's really one wild girl . She rides a motorbike to work and parties all night . Oh yeah , and she always comes to work hungover , do n't you Annie ? "
1597	1600	1601	1601	Bob	47	" Annie ? "
1617	1620	1621	1621	she	46	" Yeah , "
1638	1645	1621	1621	she	46	" I 'm real ... bad . "
1678	1684	1670	1672	Dug - E	48	" What sort of bike ? "
1695	1699	1700	1700	she	46	" A Ducati , "
1745	1748	1749	1749	he	48	" Fine , "
1752	1761	1749	1749	he	48	" Real fine . How does she do ? "
1774	1785	1767	1767	they	174	" Um , good . Rides like ... the wind . "
1809	1818	1819	1819	she	46	" She 's a beautiful piece of metal , "
1822	1839	1819	1819	she	46	" She 's more than metal , Lady , she 's a sweet piece of ass . "
1840	1845	1846	1848	Dug - E	48	" Yeah , sweet . "
1887	1917	1876	1876	He	48	" Okay , I 'll give her a chance . But if she does n't live up to my high standards , I 'm going with Jamieson and Jamieson . "
1968	1982	1959	1959	he	48	" Okay , Annie , you 're our girl . Go for it . "
1988	2003	1983	1983	She	178	" Go for it ? Are you insane ? Have you lost your mind ? "
2004	2015	1959	1959	he	48	" What 's wrong ? You 're perfect for this . "
2016	2030	2031	2031	She	178	" Perfect ! You just made me sound like a ... a rebel . "
2039	2080	2031	2031	She	178	" I do n't know anything about motorbikes or parties or drinking beer . I have n't been drunk since 2006 and even then it was only because someone spiked my soda . I 'm not my father , Bob . "
2135	2141	2142	2142	He	47	" Then you 'll learn . "
2198	2245	2162	2162	he	47	" Look , Annie , you 're our last chance . You 're the only agent under thirty here . Hell , you 're the only agent under fifty . We need you on this one . We ca n't lose Dug - E to Jamiesons . "
2246	2258	2290	2290	his	47	" Why not ? He 's a snotty - nosed little — "
2259	2275	2276	2276	He	47	" Now , now . It 's attitude like that that sends the kids elsewhere . "
2293	2327	2290	2290	his	47	" But I 'm no hip and happening young thing , Bob . I ca n't give Dug - E what he wants . I do n't know what boys his age do . "
2328	2343	2344	2344	She	188	" Do n't worry . I 've got the perfect person to teach you . "
2349	2354	2344	2344	She	188	" Teach me what ? "
2355	2363	2290	2290	his	47	" To ride a motorbike for starters . "
2364	2385	2290	2290	his	47	" You 're really going to make me get on one of those dangerous things ? I could get killed . "
2386	2415	2344	2344	She	188	" Calm down , Annie , you wo n't be killed . He 's a great teacher . He 'll make sure you do n't even fall off . "
2421	2448	2416	2416	She	188	" Gee thanks . Is he going to teach me how to drink beer , swear like a sailor and flash my breasts at passing trucks ? "
2452	2459	2449	2449	He	189	" If you ask him nicely . "
2541	2549	2535	2535	she	188	" So who is this amazing teacher ? "
2550	2565	2522	2522	she	188	" A friend of mine . We 've known each other for fifteen years . "
2566	2574	2535	2535	she	188	" Fifteen ? How old is he ? "
2575	2580	2535	2535	she	188	" Thirty - four . "
2581	2592	2522	2522	she	188	" Is n't that too old to be a rebel ? "
2618	2626	2627	2627	She	188	" He 's perfect for the job . "
2634	2648	2627	2627	She	188	" I ca n't wait to meet him . What 's his name ? "
2649	2653	2654	2654	She	188	" Zack DiMarco . "
2664	2668	2658	2658	Bob	47	" The millionaire ? "
2669	2675	2627	2627	She	188	" No . The billionaire . "
2676	2691	2627	2627	She	188	" Why would Zack DiMarco teach me to ride a motorbike and drink beer ? "
2692	2699	2658	2658	Bob	47	" Because we go way back . "
2700	2706	2707	2707	He	47	" You must be close . "
2710	2735	2707	2707	He	47	" I 'll give him a call . I 'm sure he 'll free up some time to take you on as a student . "
2736	2739	2740	2740	She	188	" Yeah . "
2743	2761	2740	2740	She	188	" What better things does a millionaire have to do but teach me to be a rebel ? "
2762	2765	2707	2707	He	47	" Billionaire . "
2779	2782	2769	2769	Zack	56	" Yo . "
2783	2790	2791	2791	Zack	56	" Zack ? It 's Bob . "
2805	2819	2791	2791	Zack	56	" Hey , Bob . Long time no see . How 's business ? "
2820	2839	2769	2769	Zack	56	" Great . The most lucrative deal of the decade just landed on McCallum and Horton 's table . "
2840	2843	2844	2844	Zack	56	" Yeah ? "
2877	2895	2868	2868	Bob	47	" We 've got the chance to sign up a young rapper , Dug - E Dug — "
2896	2902	2903	2903	Zack	56	" That 's his name ? "
2906	2918	2919	2919	Bob	47	" Sounds like a gardening tools manufacturer I bought last week . "
2922	2951	2952	2952	He	47	" He 's about as smart as a shovel too . But we have n't got him yet . He thinks we 're too old for his image . "
2955	2982	2952	2952	He	47	" What would he know ? McCallum and Horton invented cool . We put the hip in hippie , the roll in rock ' n roll . "
3059	3067	3068	3068	Zack	56	" So , how can I help ? "
3117	3125	3126	3126	Bob	47	" Mac 's daughter works for us , "
3129	3141	3126	3126	Bob	47	" She 's a nice girl . A great girl actually . "
3154	3163	3146	3146	he	56	" I think you 've mentioned her before . "
3164	3186	3146	3146	he	56	" She 's our best shot at getting Dug - E but she 's a little on the ... conservative side . "
3187	3205	3146	3146	he	56	" Your late partner 's daughter ? So she 's not a chip off the old block ? "
3206	3221	3222	3222	Zack	56	" Not even a splinter . She was never into the scene like Mac . "
3328	3341	3342	3342	Bob	47	" I want you to show her a good time , Zack , "
3345	3362	3342	3342	Bob	47	" Take her to parties , teach her about motorbikes , sex her up a bit . "
3363	3374	3342	3342	Bob	47	" Turn her into the party animal her father was . "
3375	3388	3342	3342	Bob	47	" Exactly . And I need it done in the next week . "
3413	3452	3342	3342	Bob	47	" No sweat . I 'll turn her into a woman everyone wants to know . Dug - E will think she 's the coolest person on the West Coast by the time I 've finished with her . "
4370	4374	4378	4378	his	56	" Annie McCallum ? "
4420	4427	4418	4418	themselves	249	" Sit down , Mr. DiMarco , "
4433	4435	4441	4441	she	46	" please "
4469	4472	4473	4473	he	56	" Beer , "
4476	4479	4473	4473	he	56	" Beer ? "
4507	4530	4544	4544	he	56	" It 's hot . I like to drink beer on a hot day . That alright with you , Miss McCallum ? "
4531	4537	4538	4538	Zack	56	" It 's Ms. McCallum . "
4549	4557	4544	4544	he	56	" And you can call me Zack . "
4558	4561	4544	4544	he	56	" Right . "
4686	4696	4697	4697	Zack	56	" A little strange this , is n't it ? "
4707	4725	4697	4697	Zack	56	" You mean you do n't teach people how to be rebels every day of the week ? "
4738	4742	4726	4726	His	56	" Not lately . "
4970	4975	4964	4964	He	56	" Two beers please . "
4976	4979	4980	4980	Annie	46	" Two ? "
4983	4994	4980	4980	Annie	46	" You know , you should n't drink and drive . "
5010	5021	5004	5004	his	56	" The second one 's for you , Ms. McCallum . "
5025	5040	5004	5004	his	56	" Maybe you should call me Annie . And I do n't like beer . "
5054	5074	5042	5052	a man who presumes to know what I want to drink	263	" You do n't have to like it , you just have to drink it . Lesson number one . "
5075	5082	5115	5115	his	56	" You do n't waste time . "
5083	5088	5089	5089	He	56	" Time is valuable . "
5130	5140	5121	5121	he	56	" There never seems to be enough of it . "
5141	5148	5173	5173	His	56	" Maybe you should slow down . "
5149	5159	5160	5160	She	265	" What makes you think I go too fast ? "
5166	5172	5160	5160	She	265	" Ah . I see . "
5181	5195	5177	5177	his	56	" Do n't presume to judge me by what I drive , Annie . "
5196	5210	5173	5173	His	56	" Do n't presume to judge me by what I drink , Zack . "
5327	5331	5332	5332	she	265	" Something funny ? "
5335	5366	5332	5332	she	265	" You . Bob said you were a little spitfire when you got wound up . I just did n't think it would be this easy to get you going . "
5367	5380	5381	5381	He	56	" Do you mean to say you 're riling me on purpose ? "
5389	5449	5381	5381	He	56	" Now hold on , before you tell me I 'm an arrogant pig , you should know that I 'm just trying to get your measure . If I 'm going to teach you to be more like me , then I need to know what raw material I 've got to work with . Like your attitude . "
5486	5490	5481	5481	she	267	" more like me "
5513	5526	5527	5527	she	267	" What makes you think I think you 're an arrogant pig ? "
5560	5567	5550	5550	His	56	" Women like you usually do . "
5580	5600	5568	5568	She	267	" Okay , I know I 'll regret this , but what do you mean , women like me ? "
5613	5619	5620	5620	She	267	" Intelligent , conservative women . "
5623	5672	5620	5620	She	267	" You think you know me already , do n't you . Well , Mr. DiMarco you 've been here all of about ten minutes and let me tell you there 's a lot more to me than a brain and , and ... the clothes I wear . "
5673	5682	5751	5751	He	268	" So you admit your clothes are conservative ? "
5683	5715	5751	5751	He	268	" There 's nothing wrong with my clothes ! Some people might think they 're conservative but a businesswoman ca n't wear sexy outfits or T - shirts with offensive slogans . "
5716	5750	5751	5751	He	268	" Why not ? Maybe you should try it one day . In fact , maybe I 'll get you to try it this weekend . Something like what those girls are wearing . "
5938	5950	5951	5951	She	46	" I would n't be caught dead in something like that . "
5954	5966	5951	5951	She	46	" Besides , I do n't have the figure for it . "
6021	6029	6030	6030	he	56	" Oh , I do n't know , "
6034	6044	6030	6030	he	56	" You might be able to pull it off . "
6062	6068	6069	6069	he	56	" I 've embarrassed you , "
6072	6075	6069	6069	he	56	" Sorry . "
6086	6109	6082	6082	He	56	" I 'm not embarrassed . I 'm just not sure this is appropriate conversation for two people who 've just met . "
6110	6131	6174	6174	he	56	" Maybe we should get to know each other first . That way I can work out what needs improving . "
6132	6135	6136	6136	He	56	" Improving ? "
6142	6170	6136	6136	He	56	" Sorry , wrong choice of words . It 's just that Bob was very specific about what he wants . He wants a rebel . And , "
6183	6203	6174	6174	he	56	" I just do n't see an iced tea - drinking , suit - wearing woman as a rebel . "
6221	6226	6227	6227	she	46	" Speaking of Bob , "
6230	6239	6227	6227	she	46	" how do you two know each other ? "
6245	6298	6240	6240	He	56	" He helped me out when I needed it most . Now it 's my turn to return the favor . Bob asked , so here I am . Besides , it could be fun . It 's not every day I get to teach an attractive woman how to behave badly . "
6312	6321	6322	6322	She	46	" Annie ? Are you still with me ? "
6329	6346	6322	6322	She	46	" Uh , yeah . So you were going to tell me why you owe Bob . "
6347	6373	6306	6306	He	56	" It 's no big deal . But it 's not casual conversation . Maybe I 'll tell you when we know each other better . "
6612	6619	6620	6620	he	56	" So do you like LA ? "
6735	6743	6744	6744	she	282	" What 's that supposed to mean ? "
6824	6869	6870	6870	She	282	" It 's supposed to mean , do you like LA ? Nothing hidden there , Annie . Do n't challenge everything I say . Although it 's a step in the right direction as far as turning you into a rebel is concerned . "
6922	6927	6928	6928	she	282	" LA 's okay , "
6934	6951	6928	6928	she	282	" I 've always lived here , so I do n't know anything else . You ? "
7048	7063	7064	7064	she	46	" You do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to , "
7067	7074	7064	7064	she	46	" We 've only just met — "
7075	7083	7064	7064	she	46	" I 've got nothing to hide . "
7138	7169	7132	7132	she	46	" I was born in Boston , moved to Detroit when I was five , then to Canada at ten . I 've also lived in New York and Montana . "
7170	7175	7176	7176	He	56	" You get around . "
7179	7185	7176	7176	He	56	" So I 'm told . "
7239	7252	7253	7253	He	56	" Okay , what else do you need to know , sir ? "
7288	7295	7285	7285	she	46	" You like being called sir ? "
7296	7302	7303	7303	She	46	" Only by attractive women . "
7406	7419	7399	7399	her	46	" Tell me , Annie , what 's your sex life like ? "
7437	7441	7442	7442	Annie	46	" Excuse me ? "
7449	7459	7442	7442	Annie	46	" Sex . Do you have much of it ? "
7460	7468	7469	7469	He	56	" That 's none of your business ! "
7481	7507	7508	7508	Annie	46	" You 're right , it is n't . But from now on you have kinky sex in unusual places . And lots of it . "
7530	7539	7525	7525	He	56	" I 've had enough , Mr. DiMarco . "
7543	7569	7540	7540	She	46	" This was a big mistake . I doubt Bob meant for you to hit on me in such an offensive manner . Good bye . "
7726	7735	7736	7736	he	56	" You 're dangerous when you 're annoyed , "
7739	7745	7736	7736	he	56	" Let go of me . "
7756	7770	7771	7771	She	46	" Fine . Off you go . I 'm sorry I offended you . "
7866	7870	7871	7871	She	46	" Stupid shoes . "
8045	8049	8050	8050	Zack	56	" Get in , "
8061	8067	8050	8050	Zack	56	" You 'll get blisters . "
8074	8079	8068	8068	She	46	" I 'm fine . "
8080	8089	8050	8050	Zack	56	" You 're not . Your feet hurt . "
8090	8104	8105	8105	She	46	" Leave me alone . I 'm telling Bob the deal 's off . "
8120	8154	8105	8105	She	46	" Look , Annie , I did n't mean to offend you . I 'm just trying to do what Bob asked . I 'm sorry if you took it the wrong way . "
8155	8182	8196	8196	his	307	" The wrong way ? You just told me to have sex with you ! Tell me the right way to take that sort of comment . "
8223	8270	8271	8271	She	46	" I was n't offering to have sex with you , I was suggesting you make it appear as if you have a lot of sex . And like it . You know , talk it up a bit at parties , around Doggie - Whatshisname . "
8276	8279	8271	8271	She	46	" Oh . "
8280	8300	8220	8221	a jerk	309	" Look , I 'm sorry you misunderstood me . I wo n't bring up sex again . Promise . "
8303	8311	8271	8271	She	46	" And I always keep my promises . "
8315	8332	8333	8333	She	46	" Now get in . I do n't want to follow you all the way home . "
8370	8379	8360	8360	Zack	56	" My car 's just around the corner . "
8380	8388	8389	8389	He	56	" We 'll pick it up later . "
8396	8401	8389	8389	He	56	" What ? Why ? "
8402	8412	8360	8360	Zack	56	" Because you ca n't drive with blistered feet . "
8413	8419	8420	8420	she	46	" How did you know ? "
8424	8431	8420	8420	she	46	" The limping gave you away . "
8509	8513	8514	8514	he	56	" Wait there , "
8520	8523	8524	8524	He	56	" Why ? "
8562	8570	8546	8546	he	56	" What the hell are you doing ? "
8571	8604	8605	8605	She	46	" Carrying you to your door . Then you 're going to open it , I 'm going to take you inside , sit you down and put something on those feet . "
8822	8830	8831	8831	she	46	" It 's all right , Snoopy , "
8834	8845	8831	8831	she	46	" Zack 's not abducting me , he 's just ... "
8851	8855	8856	8856	She	46	" Rescuing you ? "
8867	8870	8871	8871	Zack	56	" Cute , "
9010	9018	9019	9019	She	46	" Mmmm , that feels sooo good . "
9033	9040	9041	9041	he	56	" I think that 's enough , "
9054	9060	9061	9061	He	56	" Why did you stop ? "
9091	9096	9080	9080	his	56	" I 've finished . "
9097	9104	9105	9105	He	56	" What about the other foot ? "
9112	9117	9118	9118	he	56	" You do it , "
9283	9288	9289	9289	he	56	" I 'm going , "
9292	9306	9289	9289	he	56	" Fine . I 've got a lot of things to do anyway . "
9307	9317	9289	9289	he	56	" Fine . I 'll pick you up tomorrow . "
9318	9324	9289	9289	he	56	" Tomorrow ? What for ? "
9325	9329	9330	9330	He	56	" A ride . "
9949	9956	9957	9957	Zack	56	" What took you so long ? "
10020	10030	10031	10031	He	56	" Could n't decide what to wear , huh ? "
10053	10063	10064	10064	He	56	" You 're not going anywhere dressed like that . "
10069	10079	10064	10064	He	56	" Let 's see what else you 've got . "
10080	10087	10088	10088	He	56	" But , but ... wait ! "
10117	10130	10106	10106	He	56	" You really are n't very decisive are you ? Or neat . "
10176	10188	10163	10163	He	56	" Put this on . Do you have any leather pants ? "
10196	10199	10163	10163	He	56	" No . "
10200	10206	10207	10207	He	56	" Then put on these . "
10238	10245	10207	10207	He	56	" What about a leather jacket ? "
10246	10249	10163	10163	He	56	" No . "
10250	10254	10207	10207	He	56	" Denim jacket ? "
10255	10273	10274	10274	He	56	" Nothing I 'd be caught dead wearing this decade . Even I 've got fashion standards . "
10278	10297	10274	10274	He	56	" Too bad . Find it and put it on . Fashion 's not the issue . Yet . "
10354	10364	10365	10365	she	46	" Do you always tell women what to do ? "
10368	10371	10365	10365	she	46	" Yes . "
10372	10378	10384	10384	he	56	" And do they listen ? "
10379	10383	10384	10384	he	56	" Some do , "
10405	10409	10384	10384	he	56	" Which ones ? "
10410	10420	10421	10421	he	56	" The ones who want to sleep with me , "
10433	10442	10421	10421	he	56	" I guess that means I do n't . "
10443	10451	10384	10384	he	56	" The day 's not over yet . "
10476	10485	10466	10466	he	56	" You 're arrogant , you know that ? "
10486	10492	10466	10466	he	56	" So they tell me . "
10493	10499	10500	10500	He	56	" Oh yeah ? Who ? "
10525	10539	10519	10519	he	56	" The ones who pretend they do n't want to sleep with me . "
10679	10683	10684	10684	he	56	" Get on , "
10741	10750	10751	10751	he	56	" Now put your arms around my waist , "
10757	10764	10754	10754	She	46	" I do n't want to . "
10790	10816	10817	10817	He	56	" Okay , fine with me . Hang onto the seat behind you . Use both hands — I hate it when people fall off . "
11041	11045	11046	11046	she	46	" Slow down , "
11352	11366	11342	11342	He	56	" You 've got one hell of a grip for a little lady . "
11374	11381	11342	11342	He	56	" Guess you were pretty scared . "
11382	11402	11403	11403	He	56	" You were speeding ! And I prefer my limbs the way they are — attached to my body . "
11409	11439	11406	11406	his	56	" I was doing the same speed as everyone else . It just seems faster on the bike because you 're so vulnerable . So did you like it ? "
11440	11446	11406	11406	his	56	" It 's was okay . "
11447	11451	11452	11452	He	56	" Just okay ? "
11457	11464	11452	11452	He	56	" I bet you loved it . "
11465	11473	11474	11474	she	46	" So what are we doing here ? "
11581	11584	11585	11585	she	46	" Hey ! "
11594	11610	11585	11585	she	46	" Are you going to answer me or do you just expect me to follow ? "
11611	11616	11617	11617	he	56	" Are you hungry ? "
11629	11632	11624	11624	She	46	" Starving . "
11638	11646	11633	11633	He	56	" Then I expect you to follow . "
11661	11675	11654	11654	her	46	" Damn you , DiMarco . I could just strangle you right now . "
11676	11681	11682	11682	he	56	" Now , now , "
11688	11695	11682	11682	he	56	" violence never got anyone anywhere . "
11696	11699	11700	11700	she	46	" No , "
11703	11714	11700	11700	she	46	" but it 's a great way to relieve stress . "
11833	11838	11839	11839	he	56	" Will this do ? "
11889	11892	11893	11893	she	46	" Perfect , "
11907	11913	11896	11896	He	56	" Hope you like pastrami . "
11914	11926	11896	11896	He	56	" Love it . What else have you got in there ? "
11927	11936	11893	11893	she	46	" Just a couple of sodas and apples . "
11937	11941	11896	11896	He	56	" No beer ? "
11942	11951	11896	11896	He	56	" I thought you did n't drink beer . "
11952	11959	11893	11893	she	46	" Of course I drink beer . "
11967	11998	11964	11964	He	56	" I did n't think you did , and I did n't want you to start today when you 've got to ride home on the bike in one piece . "
11999	12007	12008	12008	she	46	" You think I 'd fall off ? "
12011	12022	12008	12008	she	46	" What sort of idiot do you think I am ? "
12023	12038	11964	11964	He	56	" I choose not to answer that on the grounds I may incriminate myself . "
12039	12042	12043	12043	They	382	" Smartass . "
12208	12222	12248	12248	his	56	" When you 've finished staring , maybe we could discuss our plan . "
12225	12229	12230	12230	she	46	" What plan ? "
12258	12271	12248	12248	his	56	" How we 're going to turn you into a new woman . "
12400	12408	12409	12409	she	46	" So , what 's the plan ? "
12451	12480	12435	12435	he	56	" Tonight , I 'll take you to a bar . We 'll have a few beers , maybe some spirits if you 're coping okay , then — "
12481	12488	12489	12489	she	46	" Of course I 'll cope , "
12522	12532	12518	12518	his	56	" Then tomorrow , I 'll take you shopping . "
12533	12539	12511	12511	She	46	" Shopping ? For what ? "
12540	12575	12578	12578	she	46	" Clothes . You ca n't wear that jacket if you want to hang out with me . You need some outfits that will make you more comfortable around people like your potential client . "
12629	12638	12639	12639	she	46	" You made me wear that stupid jacket , "
12642	12660	12639	12639	she	46	" Do n't remind me . I 'm just glad no one recognized me under the helmet . "
12661	12666	12667	12667	she	46	" Yeah , lucky , "
12670	12680	12667	12667	she	46	" Anyway , my clothes are n't all terrible . "
12681	12713	12728	12728	he	56	" After rummaging through your entire wardrobe earlier , I now know what you like to wear . None of it is appropriate for the image I 'm trying to create . "
12742	12750	12751	12751	she	46	" And what image would that be ? "
12758	12766	12751	12751	she	46	" Sleazy Hollywood agent wanted by everyone . "
12767	12777	12728	12728	he	56	" I 'm not sure about the sleazy part . "
12778	12819	12820	12820	Annie	46	" Me either , but it 's my gut instinct and I 'm going with it . We 'll turn you into the woman every man wants to sleep with and every woman wants to , well , sleep with . "
12827	12839	12823	12823	Zack	56	" That 's better . You should do that more often . "
12855	12874	12849	12849	herself	46	" I do n't know about all this . I 'm not sure I can pull it off . "
12875	12906	12907	12907	She	46	" Why not ? A change of clothes , hairstyle and more makeup and you 'll at least look the part . Besides , you 've got a great teacher . "
13039	13044	13045	13045	she	46	" So what else ? "
13048	13059	13045	13045	she	46	" Are you going to take me to some parties ? "
13063	13071	13045	13045	she	46	" I do n't really attend many . "
13072	13083	13084	13084	His	56	" Oh ? That 's not the impression I get . "
13088	13098	13084	13084	His	56	" And where did you get that impression from ? "
13099	13121	13045	13045	she	46	" I , um , have to read the gossip pages in the papers . It 's part of my job . "
13122	13130	13131	13131	he	56	" Sure , I bet it is , "
13134	13151	13131	13131	he	56	" They 're wrong anyway . I never attend half the things they have me at . "
13237	13259	13261	13261	he	56	" So apart from getting drunk and spending money , what else are you going to teach me , oh Master ? "
13294	13306	13285	13285	he	56	" I 'm going to teach you to ride a motorbike . "
13316	13324	13307	13307	Annie	46	" You 've got to be joking . "
13330	13367	13368	13368	He	56	" There is no way I 'm getting on that machine again after today . Especially to ride it by myself . It 's dangerous . Did n't you notice me shaking after I got off ? "
13371	13380	13368	13368	He	56	" I thought I just made you nervous . "
13381	13388	13389	13389	His	56	" In your dreams , DiMarco . "
13400	13421	13397	13397	his	56	" Pity . I thought I had some kind of affect on you . It was good for my ego . "
13422	13430	13368	13368	He	56	" Like your ego needs any help . "
13431	13461	13389	13389	His	56	" Hey , my ego 's as fragile as the next guy 's . Especially when a woman does n't even crack a smile when he makes a joke . "
13462	13470	13397	13397	his	56	" You have n't said anything funny ! "
13471	13480	13481	13481	She	396	" Gee thanks . Now I 'm shattered . "
13499	13532	13489	13489	He	56	" Well , at least I do n't have to teach you attitude . You 've got enough of that to knock poor little Doggie back to his mommy in New York . "
13533	13540	13576	13576	he	56	" His name 's Dug - E. "
14032	14035	14036	14036	he	56	" Annie , "
14079	14082	14083	14083	he	56	" Hey ! "
14086	14095	14083	14083	he	56	" What the hell have I done now ? "
14136	14145	14126	14126	She	46	" There was a bee on your face . "
14171	14175	14162	14162	he	56	" A bee ? "
14218	14229	14230	14230	she	46	" Did you think I just decided to slap you ? "
14236	14243	14230	14230	she	46	" Why would I do that ? "
14266	14298	14299	14299	He	56	" Who knows . I seem to have offended you more times than I can count . It would n't surprise me if I offended you by the way I slept . "
15028	15036	15037	15037	Zack	56	" What do you want to drink ? "
15049	15055	15046	15046	She	46	" Whatever you 're having . "
15061	15072	15073	15073	she	46	" Can I have mine in a glass , please ? "
15079	15082	15073	15073	she	46	" No , "
15086	15094	15084	15084	Zack	56	" You 'll drink from the bottle . "
15137	15141	15142	15142	he	56	" Keep trying , "
15145	15151	15142	15142	he	56	" Do you like it ? "
15152	15156	15157	15157	She	46	" Not bad . "
15162	15173	15157	15157	She	46	" But I 've had beer plenty of times before . "
15252	15259	15260	15260	she	46	" You come here a lot ? "
15267	15272	15264	15264	He	56	" More or less . "
15273	15280	15371	15371	he	56	" That 's not an answer . "
15281	15288	15264	15264	He	56	" Nosy , are n't you ? "
15289	15319	15264	15264	He	56	" Just curious . I do n't know much about you , but I 'm sure Bob 's told you about me . That gives you an unfair advantage . "
15320	15329	15371	15371	he	56	" That 's the way I like it . "
15337	15361	15362	15362	Zack	56	" Yesterday you said you 've lived in lots of different places . Why ? Was your father in the army or something ? "
15422	15439	15413	15413	he	56	" Okay , if I answer your question , you have to answer one of mine . "
15455	15461	15462	15462	he	56	" My parents were poor , "
15470	15518	15462	15462	he	56	" Dirt poor . Dad had two jobs but Mom kept having children . An itinerant laborer can only earn so much . He could n't support everyone and Mom could n't work because someone had to look after us . So he moonlighted as a thief . "
15519	15534	15462	15462	he	56	" Oh my God . I had no idea . Did he get caught ? "
15535	15573	15574	15574	She	451	" We moved before the law caught up with him , then my parents divorced and he died in his early forties . Shortly after , I headed to LA . The story gets boring from there . "
15578	15581	15584	15584	she	451	" Oh , "
15665	15676	15677	15677	she	46	" So tell me how you made all your money ? "
15901	15904	15905	15905	he	56	" Okay , "
15913	15937	15905	15905	he	56	" I 've got Bob to thank for that . When I moved here , I was following in my father 's footsteps . "
15938	15943	15905	15905	he	56	" Working two jobs ? "
15944	16027	15905	15905	he	56	" Stealing . Cars to be precise . One day , I was attempting to break into a nice convertible . Bob 's . But you know what an old softie he is . Instead of turning me in , he organized a job for me . Retail . A men 's wear shop . I was seventeen and it was just what I needed . Of course , Bob threatened to turn me in if I did n't stick it out . "
16028	16040	15905	15905	he	56	" You got rich working at a men 's wear shop ? "
16041	16072	16073	16073	he	466	" No , I got rich when I learned what Bob did for a living . My new boss , a friend of his , told me . You see , "
16078	16191	16073	16073	he	466	" my father had written some songs before he met my mother . It had been his dream to have them recorded , but life got in the way . I had my older sister send me Dad 's old demo tapes , and I got Bob to listen to them . He liked them and represented the family , getting a deal with Sonic Records . A very lucrative deal . The songs became popular and all six of us took our share . I used mine to buy the shop where I worked and turned it into a department store . The rest , as they say , is history . "
16192	16202	16302	16302	Annoyance	73	" Wow . Interesting . What were the songs ? "
16203	16219	16073	16073	he	466	" Ever heard of Love is a Velvet Sky ? Or Walking on Hot Coals ? "
16220	16226	16227	16227	He	468	" By The Dream Weavers ? "
16230	16237	16227	16227	He	468	" They recorded Dad 's songs . "
16238	16249	16073	16073	he	466	" I never knew . My father never discussed business . "
16250	16261	16073	16073	he	466	" He was n't involved . Bob brokered the deal . "
16262	16291	16073	16073	he	466	" That sounds right . Dad handled the publicity and temperamental artists . Since the songwriter was deceased , his talents were n't really needed , I guess . "
16326	16333	16334	16334	he	468	" You 're not like him , "
16340	16343	16337	16337	She	469	" No . "
16344	16350	16337	16337	She	469	" Tell me about him . "
16351	16363	16337	16337	She	469	" He loved life to the fullest . End of story . "
16364	16382	16383	16383	Her	469	" I told you about me , so now it 's my turn to ask a question . "
16391	16394	16383	16383	Her	469	" Shoot . "
16410	16421	16395	16395	He	468	" Why did you decide to become an entertainment agent ? "
16422	16430	16431	16431	He	468	" What sort of question is that ? "
16434	16441	16431	16431	He	468	" It just isn't ... you . "
16442	16453	16454	16454	He	468	" Not me ? What 's that supposed to mean ? "
16492	16501	16478	16478	He	468	" You 're not a typical LA agent . "
16502	16510	16511	16511	she	469	" That 's because I 'm not , "
16514	16522	16511	16511	she	469	" I 'm not a typical anything . "
16523	16527	16478	16478	He	468	" No kidding . "
16528	16552	16478	16478	He	468	" So why are you asking me such a silly question ? You wasted a perfectly good opportunity to ask me something personal . "
16553	16557	16558	16558	He	468	" Did I ? "
16627	16634	16635	16635	he	468	" Let 's change the subject , "
16647	16651	16635	16635	he	468	" Good idea . "
16652	16661	16635	16635	he	468	" What do you want to drink now ? "
16662	16670	16635	16635	he	468	" Are n't we having another beer ? "
16671	16686	16635	16635	he	468	" You 've barely touched yours . I figured you did n't like it . "
16687	16694	16635	16635	he	468	" Okay , but you choose . "
16695	16702	16635	16635	he	468	" What do you usually drink ? "
16703	16706	16709	16709	his	468	" Wine . "
16712	16718	16707	16707	He	468	" Nope , too boring . "
16722	16729	16719	16719	She	469	" You sound like Dug - E. "
16730	16744	16745	16745	he	468	" Do n't even say that in jest , Annie . Two bourbons , "
16768	16773	16755	16755	Annie	46	" That 's disgusting . "
16774	16786	16787	16787	She	46	" You 're not supposed to smell it . Drink it . "
16798	16807	16787	16787	She	46	" Guess bourbon is n't your drink either . "
16826	16833	16815	16815	Zack	56	" Do you drink at all ? "
16834	16854	16787	16787	She	46	" Of course I do . Every night at home after work , and sometimes on Saturdays with friends . "
16855	16864	16865	16865	She	469	" A glass of wine does n't count . "
16888	16898	16885	16885	She	469	" It tastes like lemonade . I like it . "
16899	16914	16787	16787	She	46	" Good . Now , I think you need to learn some bar etiquette . "
16915	16920	16976	16976	He	56	" There 's etiquette ? "
16921	16937	16885	16885	She	469	" Of course there 's bar etiquette . Starting with buying rounds for your friends . "
16938	16953	16954	16954	He	56	" You 're only saying that because you 've been paying for all these . "
16957	16975	16954	16954	He	56	" Okay , you got me . But you should learn some other tricks of the trade . "
16996	16999	16989	16989	Her	469	" Better . "
17000	17008	16885	16885	She	469	" Not from where I 'm sitting . "
17009	17029	16954	16954	He	56	" When you 're talking to a man , lean forward seductively so he can see down your shirt . "
17030	17044	16989	16989	Her	469	" If we were n't in public I 'd slap you right now . "
17045	17055	17056	17056	She	469	" And sit as if you own this place . "
17061	17068	17056	17056	She	469	" How do I do that ? "
17069	17093	16989	16989	Her	469	" Straighten you back , survey the room with disdain and look as casual as possible , no matter how drunk you get . "
17094	17100	17056	17056	She	469	" Easier said than done . "
17133	17141	17119	17119	her	469	" Not bad . Do you smoke ? "
17142	17151	17119	17119	her	469	" No . It 's a disgusting habit . "
17152	17173	17174	17174	She	469	" True , but it would help your image . Think about taking it up in the next few days . "
17190	17213	17186	17186	He	478	" Why are you teaching me all this stuff when Dug - E 's too young to drink in a bar anyway ? "
17245	17283	17284	17284	She	469	" Because drinking will give you respectability at parties , and Dug - E will pick up on that . Besides , the kid can probably drink you under the table . I could at his age . "
17288	17297	17284	17284	She	469	" I need to go to the bathroom . "
17298	17316	17327	17327	she	469	" Already ? You 've only had one drink and a few sips of beer and bourbon . "
17317	17320	17321	17321	she	469	" Hey , "
17331	17346	17321	17321	she	469	" a girl 's got ta do what a girl 's got ta do . "
17439	17446	17447	17447	Zack	56	" Lick , sip , suck . "
17499	17505	17490	17490	herself	469	" What 's so funny ? "
17521	17544	17545	17545	She	469	" Me . You . Um , this . This Tequila 's yummy . I love it . Especially the sucking part . "
17554	17565	17550	17550	His	56	" I thought you said you 'd had it before . "
17566	17575	17508	17508	his	56	" Oh yeah , I did did n't I. "
17576	17579	17580	17580	he	56	" Annie , "
17583	17617	17580	17580	he	56	" Do n't lie to me about this , it 's not going to make you cooler . If you 're feeling tipsy , I want to know before we go any further . "
17618	17621	17622	17622	She	469	" Further ? "
17651	17676	17637	17637	He	56	" I 'm fine . This is nothing . My Dad 's clients were always trying to get me drunk when they came over . "
17677	17682	17683	17683	He	56	" I can imagine . "
17697	17702	17689	17689	she	469	" Do n't stare . "
17703	17720	17637	17637	He	56	" I 'm checking to see if you 're drunk . You 're looking a little — "
17721	17724	17689	17689	she	469	" Zack ! "
17742	17755	17735	17740	the smiling blonde bouncing towards them	483	" Zack DiMarco is that you ? What are you doing here ? "
17756	17774	17804	17804	Melanie	74	" Oh , hi Melanie . I 'm uh , just having a drink with a friend . "
18062	18070	18071	18071	Annie	46	" Um , excuse me , Melanie , "
18108	18120	18121	18121	Melanie	74	" Um , can I ask you something ? Something personal ? "
18125	18144	18121	18121	Melanie	74	" Ooh , I like these sort of conversations . What do you want to know , Sweetie ? "
18153	18163	18145	18145	Annie	46	" When you go swimming , do you float ? "
18174	18178	18179	18179	Melanie	74	" Oh no , "
18190	18202	18179	18179	Melanie	74	" I never go swimming . It turns my hair green . "
18203	18207	18208	18208	Annie	46	" How unfortunate , "
18211	18226	18208	18208	Annie	46	" It sure is ! You 're so lucky to have mousy colored hair . "
18227	18230	18179	18179	Melanie	74	" Mousy ! "
18236	18239	18240	18240	Zack	56	" Okay , "
18246	18257	18240	18240	Zack	56	" I think it 's time we left , Annie . "
18265	18274	18275	18275	she	46	" But I was only just getting started , "
18281	18299	18275	18275	she	46	" Let 's stay and chat to Melanie for a while . She 's so ... witty . "
18300	18323	18324	18324	She	46	" I think you 've had enough wit for one night . We 've got a long drive to get you home . "
18383	18392	18393	18393	she	46	" It was nice meeting you , Melanie , "
18397	18407	18393	18393	she	46	" I hope we 'll see you around somewhere . "
18411	18436	18393	18393	she	46	" Oh , Zacky , that reminds me . Louisa 's having a party on Wednesday night . You 're coming are n't you ? "
18437	18444	18457	18457	Melanie	74	" I do n't think so — "
18445	18451	18452	18452	Annie	46	" Oh , but Zacky , "
18459	18479	18452	18452	Annie	46	" We simply must go to Louisa 's party . Just think what a great opportunity it would be . "
18480	18483	18484	18484	Zack	56	" Opportunity ? "
18495	18505	18490	18490	Annie	46	" Yeah , for that little project of yours . "
18506	18511	18512	18512	He	56	" Oh , yeah . "
18515	18526	18512	18512	He	56	" Looks like we 'll see you there , Mel . "
18527	18530	18531	18531	Melanie	74	" Yes , "
18535	18549	18550	18550	She	74	" I 'll see you there . Both of you . How lovely . "
18627	18630	18631	18631	she	46	" Mmm , "
18641	18644	18631	18631	she	46	" Nice . "
18717	18722	18707	18707	She	46	" Can you walk ? "
18723	18734	18707	18707	She	46	" Of course I can ! I 'm not drunk . "
18735	18742	18707	18707	She	46	" And I 'm an alien . "
18743	18747	18748	18748	He	56	" Are you ? "
18838	18847	18848	18848	he	56	" Your body 's all wrong for drinking , "
18857	18863	18864	18864	she	46	" My body 's fine , "
18872	18876	18877	18877	he	56	" I know , "
18880	18887	18877	18877	he	56	" That 's what worries me . "
19252	19260	19261	19261	she	46	" Hey , what are you doing ? "
19284	19292	19280	19280	Zack	56	" I 'm looking for your keys . "
19293	19311	19280	19280	Zack	56	" Good . We ca n't stay out here all night . What would my neighbors think ? "
19312	19318	19280	19280	Zack	56	" That you 're drunk . "
19319	19324	19325	19325	She	46	" I 'm not . "
19328	19339	19340	19340	He	56	" I bet they 'd think we 're having sex . "
19360	19369	19370	19370	She	46	" Oh , Snoopy , hello , Baby . "
19383	19388	19389	19389	she	46	" So are we ? "
19393	19396	19389	19389	she	46	" What ? "
19397	19403	19420	19420	her	46	" Going to have sex ? "
19404	19414	19415	19415	he	56	" Are you going to fall asleep on me ? "
19423	19430	19418	19418	She	46	" I can almost guarantee it . "
19431	19444	19445	19445	She	46	" Then I guess not . I hate it when that happens . "
19448	19457	19445	19445	She	46	" Bet it 's never happened to you . "
19519	19530	19531	19531	She	46	" Do you want me to help you get undressed ? "
19537	19545	19531	19531	She	46	" I have n't shaved my legs . "
19549	19576	19546	19546	He	56	" If you remember anything tomorrow , I have a feeling you 're going to regret saying that . How about I just leave you dressed . "
19577	19580	19581	19581	she	46	" Whatever , "
19588	19599	19600	19600	He	56	" Oh , no you do n't . Not yet . "
19610	19629	19600	19600	He	56	" I 'm going to get you something to make you feel better . Just wait a minute . "
19669	19690	19691	19691	They	513	" Come on , Snoopy , let 's see what words of wisdom your cute little owner 's got now . "
19720	19730	19711	19711	He	56	" Wake up . You have to drink this . "
19738	19743	19731	19731	She	46	" What is it ? "
19750	19756	19757	19757	She	46	" Hair of the dog . "
19760	19763	19757	19757	She	46	" Snoopy ! "
19781	19786	19778	19778	Zack	56	" Not that dog . "
19787	19799	19800	19800	She	46	" Oh . Good . Guess that 's all right then . "
19807	19812	19800	19800	She	46	" That 's awful . "
19813	19824	19778	19778	Zack	56	" But it 's good for you . Finish it . "
19825	19836	19837	19837	She	46	" You finish it , I 'm going to sleep . "
19855	19869	19843	19843	he	56	" Ooh , I like it when you get all manly with me . "
19870	19895	19896	19896	She	46	" I 'm not being manly , I 'm just trying to get you to drink this . Now do as you 're told . "
19906	19916	19917	19917	She	46	" Good . Now you can go to bed . "
19922	19926	19917	19917	She	46	" You coming ? "
19927	19938	19952	19952	He	56	" I thought we agreed you could n't stay awake . "
19939	19943	19944	19944	She	46	" Oh yeah . "
19990	19999	20000	20000	He	56	" So what do her boobs feel like ? "
20012	20016	20000	20000	He	56	" Melanie 's ? "
20017	20034	20000	20000	He	56	" Who else ? Or do you know lots of women with big , fake boobs ? "
20035	20052	20000	20000	He	56	" I know several . But I 've never felt hers so I would n't know . "
20053	20063	20000	20000	He	56	" Yeah sure . She was all over you . "
20080	20090	20091	20091	Annie	46	" That does n't mean we 've , ah ... "
20096	20104	20091	20091	Annie	46	" I bet they feel like watermelons . "
20326	20332	20333	20333	he	56	" I have to go , "
20340	20345	20333	20333	he	56	" But , Zack ... "
20417	20432	20410	20410	She	46	" Sorry , Annie , but you 're drunk and I need to go . "
20503	20535	20538	20538	he	56	" Good . Go . And by the way , if I was sober there 's no way I would 've kissed you . I do n't like guys like you . "
20644	20650	20668	20668	She	46	" Annie , get up , "
20722	20728	20729	20729	Zack	56	" Turn off the light . "
20740	20767	20729	20729	Zack	56	" The sun does n't come with an off switch . Annie , where have you been ? I 've been ringing the doorbell for ages . "
20768	20792	20793	20793	He	56	" Cowering under my blanket . You made me drink that God - awful hair of the dog and it did n't work . "
20851	20857	20858	20858	he	56	" You look like Hell , "
20865	20881	20858	20858	he	56	" Thanks , Einstein . Now that we 've established that , you can leave . "
20882	20891	20892	20892	She	46	" No way , this could be fun . "
20903	20906	20898	20899	The creep	520	" What ? "
20907	20915	20916	20916	She	46	" Taking you shopping with a hangover . "
20986	20990	20991	20991	she	46	" Snooping again ? "
21011	21018	20991	20991	she	46	" No , getting some aspirin . "
21030	21034	21019	21019	He	56	" Drink up . "
21035	21055	21056	21056	He	56	" That 's what you said last night with that hair of the dog stuff . This better work . "
21089	21104	21105	21105	He	56	" Oh no you do n't . You 're going to have a shower . "
21139	21144	21145	21145	She	46	" Now get undressed . "
21158	21164	21165	21165	he	56	" I 'm not staying , "
21168	21189	21165	21165	he	56	" but since you 're going to be trying on lots of clothes , I suggest you shave your legs . "
21317	21348	21382	21382	Liar	80	" Please tell me you 've got the Ferrari and not the bike . I do n't think I could handle another ride on that thing . Not this morning . "
21349	21366	21382	21382	Liar	80	" If you throw up on the bike at least you wo n’t ruin the upholstery . "
21367	21381	21382	21382	Liar	80	" I 'm not going to throw up ! I feel perfectly fine . "
21384	21404	21382	21382	Liar	80	" Good . Because we 've got a lot of shopping to do and it 's already one o'clock . "
21493	21500	21501	21501	she	46	" I ca n't afford these , "
21510	21524	21501	21501	she	46	" You could feed a starving family for a year at that price . "
21525	21536	21537	21537	he	56	" You 're not supposed to have a social conscience , "
21577	21586	21574	21574	his	56	" You 're too cool for that remember ? "
21592	21612	21574	21574	his	56	" Well , I could feed myself for a year at that price , then . How 's that ? "
21613	21636	21637	21637	She	46	" Better . But you 're not getting out of it that easy . Those shoes are all the rage this year . "
21700	21706	21692	21692	He	56	" So he told me . "
21707	21726	21692	21692	He	56	" Well , whether they 're all the rage or not , I still ca n't afford them . "
21727	21734	21735	21735	Her	46	" You do n't have to . "
21750	21758	21759	21759	He	56	" You are not buying me anything . "
21793	21797	21798	21798	he	56	" Why not ? "
21800	21807	21798	21798	he	56	" Because I 've got principles . "
21812	21831	21832	21832	She	46	" I do n't let men buy me anything until I 've slept with them at least twice . "
21845	21852	21840	21840	He	56	" That sounds like a challenge . ”
21858	21861	21862	21862	he	56	" Fine , "
21867	21881	21862	21862	he	56	" Since Bob 's paying for them , it does n't matter anyway . "
21882	21885	21886	21886	She	46	" Bob . "
21923	21929	21930	21930	Zack	56	" We 'll take them , "
21940	21947	21930	21930	Zack	56	" And a pair in red . "
21948	21960	21961	21961	Annie	46	" Red ? That 's a little extravagant is n't it ? "
21967	21984	21964	21964	He	56	" Red shoes look sexy on a woman . I think you should have a pair . "
22014	22037	22002	22003	The assistant	531	" Perhaps you would like to wear your new pair and I could pack those away for you . Or burn them . "
22048	22051	22046	22046	Zack	56	" Yes . "
22127	22130	22132	22134	a passing woman	537	" Zack ! "
22181	22190	22166	22166	She	537	" Darling , what are you doing here ? "
22191	22194	22230	22230	He	56	" Shopping . "
22195	22216	22230	22230	He	56	" I can see that , Darling , but what 's come over you ? I thought you hated shopping . "
22217	22229	22230	22230	He	56	" I do . But I 've made an exception today . "
22249	22254	22230	22230	He	56	" Annie needed shoes . "
22310	22313	22297	22297	Zack	56	" Annie ? "
22394	22397	22398	22398	she	541	" Well , "
22403	22416	22398	22398	she	541	" I need to keep moving . Shopping to do . Toodles . "
22429	22437	22424	22424	she	46	" Why did n't you introduce me ? "
22441	22449	22424	22424	she	46	" I could n't remember her name . "
22456	22484	22450	22450	She	46	" If I ever bump into you and you do n't introduce me to your companion , I 'm going to make you squirm , Zack DiMarco . "
22500	22511	22487	22487	his	56	" I 'll never forget your name , Annie McCallum . "
22726	22740	22688	22688	He	56	" I 'll look like a prostitute with this jacket and those skirts . "
22741	22760	22688	22688	He	56	" Good . That 's exactly the look all the young things are trying to achieve these days . "
22761	22767	22815	22815	Zack	56	" I 'm nearly thirty ! "
22768	22791	22688	22688	He	56	" Not until Dug - E leaves town , you 're not . I think you could pass for twenty - two . "
22847	22854	22855	22855	he	56	" They look great on you , "
23027	23032	23033	23033	someone	1250	" Hey , Zack , "
23149	23153	23155	23155	Annie	46	" You know , "
23158	23174	23155	23155	Annie	46	" giving these women the impression we 're dating is n't good for your reputation . "
23175	23188	23190	23190	she	46	" I know . Nor is it good for my love life . "
23194	23202	23190	23190	she	46	" So why are you doing it ? "
23203	23210	23211	23211	He	56	" Pretending you 're my girlfriend ? "
23214	23222	23211	23211	He	56	" I 'm taking the week off . "
23244	23261	23239	23239	he	56	" Do n't worry . I 'll make sure everyone knows we 're not an item . "
23262	23265	23266	23266	she	46	" Oh , "
23676	23691	23692	23692	he	56	" One more stop then we 'll head home and have a cold beer , "
23698	23709	23695	23695	She	46	" Okay , you can have a glass of wine . "
23710	23718	23695	23695	She	46	" So where are we headed now ? "
23719	23723	23647	23647	Zack	56	" The beach . "
23724	23734	23695	23695	She	46	" The beach ? But it 's getting late ! "
23735	23755	23695	23695	She	46	" That 's the best time . All the sunbathers have gone home and the place actually seems peaceful . "
23756	23770	23771	23771	She	46	" So why are we going to the beach if not for sunbathing ? "
23774	23789	23771	23771	She	46	" Oh . You 're not going to make me swim , are you ? "
23790	23795	23796	23796	Annie	46	" You 'll see . "
23819	23823	23814	23833	an egotistical male who said " You 'll see " with a smile as broad as the Cheshire Cat 's	567	" You 'll see "
23869	23878	23879	23879	she	46	" We 're going to eat ice cream , "
23886	23903	23904	23904	She	46	" Yep . That okay with you or are you way too sophisticated for ice cream ? "
23909	23915	23904	23904	She	46	" Do I look sophisticated ? "
23919	23923	23904	23904	She	46	" What flavor ? "
23924	23929	23930	23930	He	56	" Chocolate of course . "
23950	23954	23946	23946	She	46	" Now what ? "
23955	23962	23904	23904	She	46	" We walk along the beach . "
23963	23980	23904	23904	She	46	" Okay . But I do n't see what you 're trying to teach me here . "
23981	23989	23990	23990	She	46	" To relax and enjoy the sunset . "
23995	24026	23990	23990	She	46	" That sounds a little too normal . I do n't think Dug - E would be interested in sunsets . Sunrises maybe , after a night of hard partying . "
24027	24042	24043	24043	Zack	56	" I do n't care what Dug - E is interested in right now , "
24049	24058	24043	24043	Zack	56	" This is n't part of your training . "
24231	24236	24237	24237	she	46	" This is nice , "
24252	24256	24243	24243	He	56	" It is . "
24291	24305	24306	24306	he	56	" See , is n't it better when you lighten up a little ? "
24319	24341	24342	24342	He	56	" Lighten up ? What do you mean , lighten up ? I 'm perfectly light , thank you very much . "
24345	24352	24342	24342	He	56	" Me and my big mouth . "
24353	24361	24362	24362	He	56	" What 's that supposed to mean ? "
24378	24391	24392	24392	He	56	" You were going to say something then . What was it ? "
24397	24400	24394	24394	his	56	" Nothing . "
24401	24407	24342	24342	He	56	" Tell me , Zack . "
24408	24434	24394	24394	his	56	" Annie , let it slide . It was n't important . And what happened to the girl I 've been shopping with all day ? "
24435	24444	24445	24445	He	56	" Now what 's that supposed to mean ? "
24448	24468	24445	24445	He	56	" It means you 've changed back to the argumentative woman who does n't know how to enjoy herself . "
24469	24483	24484	24484	He	56	" Does n't know how to enjoy herself ! What about last night ? "
24489	24501	24502	24502	She	46	" I thought you did n't remember much about last night . "
24505	24519	24502	24502	She	46	" I do n't . But I do remember having a good time . "
24520	24525	24526	24526	She	46	" At the bar ? "
24531	24541	24526	24526	She	46	" Of course . Why ? What happened afterwards ? "
24590	24605	24587	24587	She	46	" Oh God , I threw up on your shoes , did n't I ? "
24612	24626	24627	24627	She	46	" Yes , but that 's okay . I 've got other shoes . "
24635	24659	24627	24627	She	46	" I 'm so embarrassed . I threw up on Zack DiMarco 's shoes ! How could I ? I 'm so sorry — "
24660	24663	24664	24664	he	56	" Annie , "
24674	24707	24664	24664	he	56	" it 's okay . You enjoyed yourself , and that 's the main thing . And that 's the only embarrassing thing you did last night , so do n't worry . "
24724	24731	24732	24732	she	46	" I 'm never drinking again , "
24735	24775	24732	24732	she	46	" Sure you will . Tomorrow night actually . I 'm taking you to a club . But I 'll keep a better eye on you this time now that I know your alcohol tolerance level is about zero . "
24793	24796	24797	24797	she	46	" Hey ! "
24894	24901	24902	24902	he	56	" Oh no you do n't , "
24950	24954	24955	24955	she	46	" En garde , "
24963	24987	24955	24955	she	46	" You think you can beat me in a food fight , huh ? Well you 've picked the wrong opponent , Sweetheart . "
25038	25041	25042	25042	she	46	" Mmmm , "
25090	25098	25083	25083	he	56	" You look good enough to eat . "
25211	25214	25215	25215	he	56	" Sorry , "
25275	25280	25261	25261	she	46	" That 's okay . "
25324	25332	25333	25333	Zack	56	" No , you do n't understand , "
25336	25376	25333	25333	Zack	56	" Hell , I do n't really understand , but you said it yourself last night , I 'm not your type . Well , you 're not my type either so let 's just leave it at that . "
25389	25394	25383	25383	Annie	46	" I said that ? "
25846	25859	25860	25860	she	46	" Guess this awkward silence means we 're not having that drink , "
25930	25933	25934	25934	he	56	" Annie , "
25948	25958	25934	25934	he	56	" of course we are . If you want . "
26095	26100	26101	26101	he	56	" Look , Annie , "
26147	26151	26152	26152	she	46	" I understand , "
26177	26191	26192	26192	She	46	" Let 's just forget about it . It should n't have happened . "
26272	26281	26269	26269	she	46	" I 'll be back in a minute , "
26628	26638	26639	26639	he	56	" You really do n't eat well , Annie , "
26651	26664	26639	26639	he	56	" Maybe you should go to the supermarket once in a while . "
26813	26820	26821	26821	Zack	56	" What are you looking at ? "
26832	26853	26824	26824	Snoopy	63	" Okay , okay , I know . You 're right . I have to go and talk to her . "
26881	26896	26878	26878	Snoopy	63	" I 'll give you a doggy biscuit if you go talk to her . "
26906	26923	26901	26901	Zack	56	" You 're right . I would n't do it for one of those things either . "
27076	27082	27083	27083	she	46	" What are you doing ? "
27091	27094	27083	27083	she	46	" Um ... "
27186	27189	27190	27190	he	56	" Um , "
27226	27232	27223	27223	he	56	" Why are you naked ? "
27238	27246	27247	27247	she	46	" I was trying on these pants , "
27251	27255	27247	27247	she	46	" I see . "
27265	27272	27273	27273	She	46	" So how do they look ? "
27301	27306	27307	27307	She	46	" Oh my God ! "
27384	27389	27390	27390	he	56	" I 'm going , "
27422	27433	27434	27434	he	56	" I want to see you in those leathers tomorrow , "
27437	27449	27434	27434	he	56	" We 're going for a ride . You 're driving . "
27558	27563	27564	27564	he	56	" You look good , "
27792	27797	27798	27798	he	56	" Wearing the thong ? "
27826	27832	27813	27813	he	56	" What do you think ? "
27940	27947	27948	27948	he	56	" Are you ready for this ? "
27952	27963	27948	27948	he	56	" You 're not going to chicken out on me ? "
27964	27972	27948	27948	he	56	" Chicken out ? Me ? Never . "
27982	28000	27979	27979	her	46	" Good . It 's a piece of cake . It 's just like driving a car . "
28038	28043	28044	28044	She	46	" Now get on . "
28047	28052	28044	28044	She	46	" Start it up . "
28058	28072	28073	28073	he	56	" Drive down the street , turn around and come back . Slowly , "
28137	28147	28148	28148	she	46	" Just checking to see if you were watching , "
28151	28159	28160	28160	he	56	" You 're dangerous , Annie McCallum , "
28176	28180	28172	28172	his	56	" Very dangerous . "
28231	28234	28235	28235	she	46	" Easy , "
28238	28249	28235	28235	she	46	" Good . Do it again . Faster this time . "
28262	28269	28259	28259	Zack	56	" Okay , you 're ready . "
28270	28274	28235	28235	she	46	" For what ? "
28275	28280	28281	28281	She	46	" A bigger road . "
28286	28297	28283	28283	her	46	" No way . I 'm not riding in traffic . "
28324	28334	28335	28335	she	46	" I 'm not riding on the open road , "
28339	28344	28335	28335	she	46	" Yes you are . "
28345	28357	28358	28358	He	56	" You ca n't tell me what to do , Zack . "
28363	28369	28360	28360	his	56	" I 'll tell Bob . "
28375	28381	28370	28370	She	46	" I do n't care . "
28420	28423	28424	28424	he	56	" Look , "
28427	28446	28424	28424	he	56	" I know you 're scared . I know this is a big step for you , but — "
28447	28453	28454	28454	She	46	" I am not scared . "
28497	28503	28493	28493	She	46	" What are you doing ? "
28504	28530	28531	28531	She	46	" You do n't think I 'd let you go out for a ride on your own already do you ? I 'm not insane . "
28759	28762	28763	28763	he	56	" Well ? "
28781	28786	28778	28778	She	46	" It was okay . "
28787	28802	28803	28803	Babe	85	" Okay ? Ha ! You loved it , Babe , I could tell . "
28851	28860	28861	28861	she	46	" Did you see everyone stare at us ? "
28869	28877	28861	28861	she	46	" They thought I was so cool . "
28878	28932	28933	28933	She	46	" Next time , you go on your own . You need more practice before Dug - E arrives but I think you 'll do great . And just so you sound like you know what you 're talking about , I 'll be giving you a pop quiz in a few days . "
28936	28944	28933	28933	She	46	" This is worse than high school . "
28958	28963	28964	28964	she	46	" You coming in ? "
28968	28974	28975	28975	She	46	" You inviting me in ? "
28978	28989	28975	28975	She	46	" You going to walk in on me naked again ? "
28990	28993	28994	28994	She	46	" Maybe . "
29030	29037	29038	29038	she	46	" I think he likes you , "
29041	29051	29038	29038	she	46	" I think he wants to hump my leg . "
29052	29080	29081	29081	Zack	56	" You 're lucky . Usually when I bring a man back here he wants to bite their , um , you - know - what off . "
29092	29104	29105	29105	He	56	" I feel privileged . So what 's with the beer ? "
29114	29122	29105	29105	He	56	" I thought you only drank wine . "
29123	29145	29146	29146	He	56	" I 'm practicing . Besides , I figured it was a bit wimpy to drink wine after riding a motorbike . "
29159	29168	29169	29169	he	56	" Mind if I turn on the TV ? "
29178	29188	29169	29169	he	56	" Sure , treat this place like your own ? "
29189	29196	29172	29172	he	56	" There 's a game on . "
29197	29201	29202	29202	she	46	" Even better , "
29210	29213	29202	29202	she	46	" Basketball ? "
29214	29217	29172	29172	he	56	" Baseball . "
29218	29222	29172	29172	he	56	" Lucky me . "
29223	29229	29202	29202	she	46	" Do n't like baseball ? "
29230	29249	29172	29172	he	56	" Ca n't say I 've ever sat and watched a whole game . It looks pretty boring . "
29250	29259	29260	29260	he	56	" Maybe I 'll take you one day , "
29268	29276	29260	29260	he	56	" I 'll look forward to it . "
29296	29305	29292	29292	Zack	56	" I did n't realize you liked sport . "
29311	29318	29306	29306	He	56	" What gave you that idea ? "
29322	29334	29319	29319	She	46	" I thought you 'd be too , ah ... busy . "
29339	29351	29319	29319	She	46	" Something tells me you were going to say too rich . "
29352	29374	29375	29375	He	56	" No ! No , no , no . And there 's no such thing as too rich in LA anyway . "
29384	29387	29375	29375	He	56	" Right . "
29408	29419	29420	29420	she	46	" Same as being too famous , or too attractive , "
29423	29428	29429	29429	He	56	" Or too weird . "
29432	29441	29429	29429	He	56	" Cocky little thing , are n't you ? "
29442	29449	29450	29450	He	56	" Takes one to know one . "
29567	29574	29564	29564	Zack	56	" Relax and enjoy the game . "
29575	29584	29524	29524	She	46	" No offence , but baseball is boring . "
29585	29595	29564	29564	Zack	56	" Then just sit and enjoy peace and quiet . "
29596	29599	29600	29600	He	56	" Huh ? "
29603	29630	29600	29600	He	56	" Just think your own thoughts for a while . You do n't have to be doing something every waking moment . Get some down time . "
29631	29663	29564	29564	Zack	56	" Down time ? Are you crazy ? Who 's got time for down time ? I 've got dishes in the sink , the floor needs sweeping and Snoopy smells . "
29682	29697	29564	29564	Zack	56	" You definitely need to relax . You 're more uptight than I thought . "
29698	29715	29716	29716	His	56	" Do you deliberately try to annoy me , Zack or does it just come naturally ? "
29721	29724	29725	29725	He	56	" Sometimes . "
29731	29775	29725	29725	He	56	" But this is n't one of them . I thought you had the attitude thing down okay , but now I 'm not so sure . From what Bob told me , this Dug - E kid does n't care about anything . "
29776	29788	29716	29716	His	56	" When he 's not smashing up hotel rooms . So ? "
29789	29812	29725	29725	He	56	" So you should n't too . You need to go with the flow a bit more . Loosen up . Relax . "
29813	29826	29827	29827	He	56	" Stop telling me to relax . It 's driving me nuts . "
29833	29839	29830	29830	his	56	" There you go again . "
29853	29864	29865	29865	he	56	" Turn around and I 'll give you a massage , "
29875	29881	29865	29865	he	56	" Maybe that 'll help . "
30010	30015	30016	30016	he	56	" That 's it , "
30022	30026	30016	30016	he	56	" just relax . "
30100	30105	30106	30106	she	46	" This is wrong , "
30329	30334	30335	30335	he	56	" What 's wrong ? "
30338	30341	30335	30335	he	56	" Nothing . "
30358	30377	30348	30348	his	56	" Look , I did n't mean anything by that . I was just getting you to relax . "
30428	30431	30423	30423	she	46	" Huh ? "
30454	30470	30445	30445	She	46	" Chalk the experience up to practice , Annie . You seemed to need it . "
30471	30474	30475	30475	she	46	" What ? "
30478	30486	30475	30475	she	46	" I need practice at kissing now ? "
30487	30490	30491	30491	He	56	" Yeah . "
30495	30512	30513	30513	he	56	" It 's all part of being a wild child . Which you 're clearly not , "
30522	30540	30513	30513	he	56	" And since you 'll probably have to kiss this Dug - E guy to convince him ... "
30577	30582	30583	30583	Zack	56	" He 's eighteen ! "
30627	30630	30631	30631	he	56	" Right , "
30635	30645	30631	30631	he	56	" He 's probably got more experience than you . "
30683	30686	30687	30687	he	56	" Good , "
30690	30704	30687	30687	he	56	" That 's exactly what a rebel would do . You 're learning . "
30712	30722	30709	30709	he	56	" Although it 's not very becoming on you . "
30734	30744	30745	30745	he	56	" I think I 'd better shut up now , "
30748	30760	30745	30745	he	56	" I think you should 've shut up five minutes ago . "
30761	30773	30774	30774	He	56	" You had your tongue down my throat five minutes ago . "
30793	30803	30784	30784	She	46	" Then all of a sudden you did n't . "
30839	30842	30845	30845	she	46	" Sorry , "
30849	30869	30845	30845	she	46	" Yeah , right . Well , now that things have suddenly become awkward I guess I better go . "
30870	30874	30875	30875	She	46	" Guess so . "
30902	30914	30915	30915	she	46	" Are you going to take me for a ride tomorrow ? "
31020	31029	31011	31011	He	56	" We 'll see . Looks like rain . "
31030	31033	31034	31034	she	46	" Right , "
31038	31041	31034	31034	she	46	" Rain . "
31163	31168	31173	31173	He	52	" How was your weekend "
31240	31248	31249	31249	Bob	47	" Have a rough weekend , Annie ? "
31275	31280	31281	31281	she	46	" Something like that , "
31382	31389	31390	31390	He	47	" What 's up , Bob ? "
31393	31410	31390	31390	He	47	" Nothing much , just wanted to see how it went with Zack over the weekend . "
31411	31414	31465	31465	She	46	" Fine . "
31415	31422	31431	31431	his	47	" You two hit it off ? "
31423	31428	31429	31429	He	47	" More or less . "
31434	31443	31431	31431	his	47	" You argued with him did n't you ? "
31450	31464	31447	31447	her	46	" Why are you blaming me ? Maybe he drove me to it . "
31470	31477	31465	31465	She	46	" What has he said anyway ? "
31478	31506	31507	31507	He	47	" Nothing , I have n't spoken to him yet . I noticed you were in a bad mood and I figured it did n't go well . "
31510	31531	31507	31507	He	47	" Pity . I half expected you two to get along . Either that or you 'd kill each other . "
31532	31538	31539	31539	she	46	" I 'm still alive , "
31542	31551	31539	31539	she	46	" Barely . You should look at yourself . "
31565	31587	31588	31588	Annie	46	" Do n't worry . We 'll just wing it when Dug - E arrives . We 'll get by somehow . "
31639	31642	31643	31643	she	46	" Bob , "
31668	31676	31648	31648	He	47	" Can you tell me one thing ? "
31677	31680	31648	31648	He	47	" Shoot . "
31681	31692	31693	31693	His	47	" Is Zack as ... bad as his reputation suggests ? "
31697	31710	31693	31693	His	47	" Why do you want to know ? What did he say ? "
31731	31763	31725	31725	She	46	" Nothing . I 'm just getting mixed signals . One minute he seems so laid back and devil - may - care and the next he 's tense and mysterious . "
31764	31808	31809	31809	Zack	56	" He 's not as bad as the tabloids make him out to be . He hates the public attention and I guess that can make him seem stand - offish . Get him on his ranch and he 's a different man . "
31841	31846	31847	31847	Bob	47	" Um , Annie , "
31850	32191	31847	31847	Bob	47	" we really need Dug - E. Maybe you should give Zack a call ... He patted her arm and left . Great . Way to make her feel guilty . The rest of the day went by slower than a snail on valium . At five to five , Annie could n't stand it anymore and called Zack . She figured breaking the kiss off was her fault . The slap afterward was definitely deserved , but he could have said what he 'd said to get back at her for the interrupted kiss . So it was up to her to make the first move at reconciliation . She rang his home number and left a message on his answering machine . She left a message on his cell phone too and would have called his office number if she had it . Probably just as well he had n't given it to her — she did n't want to speak to a secretary and start any rumors . He 'd hate people to think he was seeing someone like her . He might even refuse to see her . And that was the last thing she wanted right now . Bob needed her and Zack to work things out . She 'd heard the desperation in his voice . * * * Zack listened to the messages on his phone and chewed his lip . He was relieved Annie had called him although her apology for slapping him made him feel guilty . She had nothing to apologize for . It had been his fault . The kiss and the subsequent explanation were uncalled for . He 'd felt like a cad and wanted to call her , but he was n't sure if that was wise . Maybe they should just let it go , never see each other again . All that flew out the window at the sound of her voice . Bob 's call just added to his resolution to call Annie back . "
32199	32203	32194	32194	you	684	" Bob said . "
32218	32219	32213	32213	I	0	" "
32235	32252	32227	32227	I	0	" Oh hell , he 'd rubbed Bob the wrong way and hurt Annie 's feelings . "
32266	32288	32257	32257	I	0	" He said it partly to test the waters and partly because he felt it was the right thing to do . "
32306	32511	32298	32298	You	684	" Bob hung up , leaving Zack confused . What should he say to her ? How could he make it up to her ? They needed to put the previous night out of their minds . The best way to do that was to go out , away from the privacy of home , but somewhere where they would be left alone ... He knew the perfect place . But knowing Annie , she would n't have anything appropriate to wear and he did n't want her to use that as an excuse . * * * At five , Annie left the office . She 'd had enough of the day . If Zack did n't call , she 'd curl up with a good book and forget about him . Forever . But a good dose of misery was boring without chocolate fudge ice cream so she stopped on the way home and purchased a tub . She also bought two Snickers bars and some Cheetos . No point doing things by halves . When she got home , the red light on her answering machine flashed wildly . She pressed the button and listened as she put her groceries away . "
32516	32523	32514	32514	me	0	" said Zack 's sultry voice . "
32531	32540	32541	32541	Bob	47	" The next message was also from him . "
32606	32615	32616	32616	I	0	" The machine beeped for the third message . "
32622	32626	32616	32616	I	0	" Zack said . "
32672	32942	32666	32666	I	0	" Oh boy . She suddenly felt weak at the knees and had to sit lean against her kitchen bench to steady herself . Zack wanted to see her . Why ? Probably he wanted to get revenge for last night . If she had any sense she 'd leave the house right now , but she was sorely lacking in the sense department lately . Besides , she 'd made the first move by leaving messages on his phone and now she had to face the consequences . She thought about all the things she could possibly say to him . ' Sorry ' sounded lame but it was all she came up with in the end . She flipped open the lid on the ice cream tub . Situations like this called for serious thinking and she could only think if she was calm . Ice cream had that effect on her , especially the chocolate kind . When the doorbell rang , she jumped , knocking the ice cream tub off the bench . Chocolate fudge splattered on the floor . She returned the tub to the bench but left the ice cream that had fallen out for Snoopy to lick up . She opened the door . Oh boy . Zack wore a tuxedo . He looked hot enough to melt any woman 's defenses and Annie could feel hers pooling in the pit of her stomach . His hair was combed back into sleek waves and his chin was hairless , quite an achievement considering he seemed to have a permanent five o'clock shadow . "
32945	32969	33032	33032	Zack	56	" she breathed , then bit her lip because she had n't meant to say it out loud . He lifted both eyebrows . "
32976	32980	32971	32971	I	0	" She nodded . "
33006	33020	32995	32995	I	0	" He held up a bag which she had n't noticed him carrying . "
33030	33031	33025	33025	I	0	" "
33039	33040	33034	33034	you	0	" "
33060	33061	33062	33062	Shabby	86	" "
33078	33088	33062	33062	Shabby	86	" He grinned and chucked her under the chin . "
33099	33110	33096	33097	a baby	147	" He pushed past her and held out the bag . "
33115	33116	33096	33097	a baby	147	" "
33124	33143	33144	33144	I	0	" He held out his hands and shrugged his shoulders in a gesture typical of his Italian heritage . "
33160	33181	33153	33153	I	0	" She still did n't move so he took her by the shoulders and steered her toward the bedroom door . "
33192	33231	33183	33183	I	0	" He handed her the bag , gently shoved her through and closed the door before she could protest . But that was n't going to stop her . She opened the door and poked her head round . "
33251	33252	33253	33253	I	0	" "
33272	33273	33262	33262	Snoopy	63	" "
33297	33319	33291	33291	He	63	" Zack put one arm against the door frame and leaned towards her . He smelled edible . He looked cheeky . "
33341	33403	33404	33404	You	0	" Annie had the great satisfaction of slamming the door in his smiling face . * * * Zack felt like a teenager as he waited for Annie to finish dressing . He paced the cleanly licked floor of her small kitchen , then stopped mid - stride as Snoopy cocked his head to one side and looked up at him . "
33415	33426	33412	33413	an idiot	615	" He helped himself to the tub of ice cream . "
33442	33683	33435	33436	two friends	693	" Half an hour later , he 'd flipped on the TV but not even sport could soothe his anxiety . Last night had been an embarrassment , a blow to his ego . He thought he 'd ruined everything with his smartass comment about the kiss being part of her training . He regretted saying it and he wanted to make it up to her . But he 'd been worried all day about how she 'd react . It had been an enormous relief to hear her voice on his answering machine that afternoon . Now all he had to do was explain why he 'd kissed her in the first place . That would n't be easy . Finally , the bedroom door opened and Annie made her entrance . Zack released his breath and stood . Her strapless black dress , flecked with gold , shimmered in the waning light . It hugged her petite frame , enhancing the nip of her tiny waist and the gentle roundness of her hips . Her breasts swelled over the top of the dress and he wished he could place his lips on the exposed flesh . She wore her hair up with sexy tendrils falling from her temples down her cheeks . Her makeup was subtle yet perfect for her naturally pretty features . She was , by far , the most stunning woman he 'd ever seen . "
33688	33701	33684	33684	You	694	" he said quietly , his voice sounding unnatural to his ears . "
33707	33735	33435	33436	two friends	693	" she said in that self - deprecating way of hers . Why did she do that ? What made her think she was n't good enough ? "
33750	33786	33748	33748	you	694	" He took her jacket and placed it around her shoulders . He caught a whiff of her perfume and had to hold himself back from burying his face in the hollow of her throat . "
33789	33837	33748	33748	you	694	" His voice caught . He coughed to hide it , but she 'd noticed . A small smile crept across her lips and he was damned if he did n't feel himself blushing . He must be , because her intense blue eyes sparkled with laughter . "
33844	33852	33748	33748	you	694	" he said . The sparkle disappeared . "
33863	33867	33856	33856	You	697	" He grinned . "
33877	33878	33870	33870	I	0	" "
33889	33890	33883	33883	you	0	" "
33904	33905	33897	33897	you	0	" "
33913	33943	33897	33897	you	0	" Annie told Snoopy not to wait up then closed the door behind them . Zack opened the car door for her then got into the driver 's seat . "
33950	33954	33897	33897	you	0	" she asked . "
33964	33965	33966	33966	I	0	" "
33972	33973	33966	33966	I	0	" "
33979	33980	33974	33974	You	0	" "
33984	33997	33974	33974	You	0	" Like never . She could n't even afford the hors d'oeuvres . "
34012	34016	33974	33974	You	0	" He shrugged . "
34054	34055	34047	34049	an older woman	703	" "
34075	34114	34071	34071	he	704	" And she did n't like Zack encouraging her to kiss other men ... er , boys . Besides , there 'd been more to that kiss than he 'd let on . She was sure of it . "
34141	34150	34151	34151	I	0	" She shook her head to clear it . "
34167	34168	34169	34169	You	46	" "
34176	34177	34169	34169	You	46	" "
34194	34195	34196	34196	We	710	" "
34220	34226	34227	34227	I	0	" he flashed a smile , "
34236	34344	34345	34345	Your	712	" His words warmed her . His reaction to her entrance had been extremely satisfying and worth the pain of the hairpins digging into her scalp . Jacques restaurant had a perfect view of the sunset over the water . It was a favorite haunt of Hollywood producers and actors with recent box office success and the occasional wealthy industrialist or investor . Annie was n't exactly sure which of these last categories Zack fit into , or if he did at all , but he seemed at home in the understated style of the restaurant . Even the snooty waiters smiled and greeted him by name . "
34352	34402	34345	34345	Your	712	" asked a young waiter who obviously had n't learned the art of waiting in exclusive restaurants because his smile seemed genuine . They were led to a table by the window with a spectacular view . The waiter held Annie 's seat out for her then discretely disappeared . "
34409	34421	34404	34404	you	60	" she said , studying the menu that had no prices . "
34443	34444	34434	34434	their	715	" "
34454	34464	34448	34448	someone	1250	" He had n't bothered picking up the menu . "
34491	34501	34434	34434	their	715	" She made a clicking sound with her tongue . "
34513	34514	34434	34434	their	715	" "
34517	34525	34434	34434	their	715	" He leaned forward and studied her . "
34532	34533	34434	34434	their	715	" "
34554	34574	34575	34575	I	0	" The fact that he dated publicity - seeking starlets . He frowned and his eyelids lowered , glaring . "
34610	34628	34636	34636	Annie	46	" His eyes narrowed and she picked up vibrations of annoyance from his side of the table . "
34655	34659	34646	34646	I	0	" Oh - kay .
34735	34745	34723	34723	His	56	" What is it you actually do , Zack ? "
34746	34752	34717	34717	She	46	" I 'm an investor . "
34753	34760	34717	34717	She	46	" What do you invest in ? "
34761	34790	34791	34791	He	56	" Whatever I think is going to make money . New companies , poorly managed companies with potential , sometimes movies if a good one comes my way . "
34801	34815	34791	34791	He	56	" I thought you knew . The curiosity must have nearly killed you . "
34816	34819	34820	34821	The waiter	250	" Nearly . "
34872	34884	34885	34885	Annie	46	" So you 're thirty - four , handsome and rich , "
34915	34922	34923	34923	He	56	" Why are n't you married ? "
34959	34981	34939	34939	he	56	" I 'm not answering unless you answer my question . Why did Bob give you a job as an agent ? "
34992	34998	34999	34999	He	56	" Because I 'm good . "
35003	35040	34999	34999	He	56	" No offence , Annie , but you 're not . You do n't go to parties , you do n't know many people in the business and you hate shmoozing with the ones you do . "
35075	35078	35079	35079	he	56	" Sorry , "
35088	35113	35079	35079	he	56	" but it 's the truth . Now , are you going to answer my question ? Why did Bob give you a job ? "
35132	35138	35139	35139	he	56	" Just as I thought , "
35148	35156	35139	35139	he	56	" Then I ca n't answer yours . "
35157	35160	35161	35161	she	46	" Fine , "
35164	35171	35172	35172	He	56	" I do n't care anyway . "
35190	35201	35202	35202	she	46	" I think I 'll have the quail for starters , "
35223	35233	35234	35234	Zack	56	" Guess you want to change the subject then , "
35346	35372	35373	35373	She	46	" Okay , lets get back to our safe topic . We came here to learn flirting techniques . Show me what you 've got . "
35383	35389	35373	35373	She	46	" Now ? Who with ? "
35396	35399	35390	35390	He	56	" Me . "
35400	35414	35373	35373	She	46	" You ? I thought we came here to try it on strangers ? "
35415	35429	35373	35373	She	46	" After you graduate . Grade schoolers need to start with something easy . "
35430	35439	35390	35390	He	56	" But I ca n't flirt with you ! "
35449	35453	35444	35444	his	56	" Why not ? "
35454	35464	35373	35373	She	46	" Because , well , because you 're you . "
35465	35475	35373	35373	She	46	" Is that a good thing or bad thing ? "
35476	35492	35493	35493	He	56	" You can take it anyway you want . I ca n't flirt with you . "
35507	35511	35512	35512	He	56	" Okay then . "
35517	35523	35512	35512	He	56	" Flirt with the waiter . "
35524	35528	35373	35373	She	46	" The waiter ? "
35529	35536	35537	35537	She	737	" Yeah . He likes you . "
35548	35554	35537	35537	She	737	" How do you know ? "
35555	35570	35373	35373	She	46	" He could n't keep his eyes off your ass when we walked in . "
35571	35574	35575	35575	She	737	" Oh . "
35589	35594	35582	35583	the waiter	250	" This is embarrassing . "
35595	35602	35373	35373	She	46	" You think everything 's embarrassing . "
35603	35629	35373	35373	She	46	" That 's because I ca n't do anything without putting my foot in my mouth . And I 'm not used to ... this . "
35630	35641	35582	35583	the waiter	250	" Just relax . Do n't worry about being embarrassed . "
35642	35649	35373	35373	She	46	" Easy for you to say . "
35650	35665	35666	35666	She	737	" Not exactly . I have to sit with you . Guilt by association . "
35770	35781	35763	35763	She	46	" Before you go , please tell me your name . "
35782	35790	35763	35763	She	46	" Peter . Is there anything else ? "
35810	35818	35819	35819	Peter	88	" I like what you 're wearing . "
35840	35846	35819	35819	Peter	88	" It 's a uniform . "
35847	35850	35883	35883	Zack	56	" Oh . "
35856	35867	35868	35868	He	88	" Well , you , um , wear it well . "
35874	35877	35868	35868	He	88	" Thanks . "
35959	35966	35953	35953	She	46	" Do you come here often ? "
35995	35999	36000	36000	Zack	56	" Good going , "
36006	36019	36000	36000	Zack	56	" Now the poor guy thinks you 're making fun of him . "
36020	36032	36033	36033	She	46	" No , he thinks you 're making fun of him . "
36256	36259	36260	36260	Zack	56	" Dance ? "
36280	36289	36275	36275	She	46	" I 'm not a very good dancer . "
36290	36296	36297	36297	He	56	" Just follow my lead . "
36333	36337	36338	36338	she	46	" Show off , "
36344	36358	36338	36338	she	46	" Just letting everyone see the beautiful woman I get to dance with . "
36418	36422	36423	36423	he	56	" You know , "
36426	36439	36423	36423	he	56	" you really are n't a very good flirt , are you ? "
36440	36462	36463	36463	He	56	" You sound surprised . I thought I 'd made that obvious from day one when all we did was argue . "
36466	36512	36463	36463	He	56	" We were n't arguing , we were disagreeing . Besides , I thought that was your way of flirting . I guess not all guys fall for that don't - mess - with - me attitude . I 'm just a sucker for punishment . "
36596	36600	36601	36601	he	56	" Poor Peter , "
36604	36613	36601	36601	he	56	" I think you scared him into quitting . "
36614	36652	36601	36601	he	56	" Very funny . He has n't quit , I saw him before . He just swapped tables with the crabby old waiter . And I do n't think I was the one who scared him off . "
36653	36661	36601	36601	he	56	" What 's that supposed to mean ? "
36662	36667	36668	36668	she	46	" Oh , nothing , "
36672	36682	36668	36668	she	46	" but I saw that look you gave him . "
36733	36739	36740	36740	he	56	" Do you want dessert ? "
36748	36782	36783	36783	He	56	" Of course I want dessert . It 's the best part of any meal . Besides , I have n't got any ice cream at my place after you ate it all . "
36795	36800	36783	36783	He	56	" It was Snoopy . "
36801	36816	36783	36783	He	56	" Really ? Did he use one paw or two to hold the spoon ? "
36817	36821	36822	36822	They	759	" Very funny . "
36900	36904	36905	36905	he	56	" My treat , "
36966	36971	36972	36972	he	56	" Let 's go , "
37003	37017	36997	36997	he	56	" You have n't had too much to drink again , have you ? "
37018	37021	37022	37022	She	46	" No . "
37025	37051	37022	37022	She	46	" I do n't need to be drunk to make a fool of myself . I do a perfectly good job when I 'm sober . "
37290	37293	37294	37294	he	56	" Annie , "
37300	37305	37294	37294	he	56	" I 'm sorry . "
37330	37334	37335	37335	she	46	" What for ? "
37342	37349	37335	37335	she	46	" I ca n't help this . "
37372	37380	37368	37368	He	56	" You just do this to me ... "
37659	37664	37665	37665	She	46	" Oh , my ... "
37757	37765	37766	37766	she	46	" You 've already seen me naked , "
37769	37779	37766	37766	she	46	" I think it 's time I saw you . "
37872	37877	37859	37859	She	46	" Oh , my ... "
37944	37947	37948	37948	she	46	" Now , "
37964	37967	37968	37968	he	56	" Condom , "
38026	38036	38037	38037	His	56	" Um , maybe we should take this slow ... "
38086	38089	38090	38090	He	56	" Oh ! "
38259	38265	38266	38266	He	56	" I have to go . "
38272	38281	38266	38266	He	56	" I 've got a long day tomorrow . "
38282	38287	38288	38288	She	46	" You 're leaving ? "
38300	38313	38314	38314	She	46	" Stay . I 'm up for round two if you are . "
38327	38333	38319	38319	he	56	" I have to go . "
38430	38453	38418	38418	He	56	" Annie , Baby , do n't look at me like that . I ca n't stay . We should n't have ... "
38454	38459	38460	38460	She	46	" Fine . Go . "
38466	38469	38460	38460	She	46	" Annie — "
38470	38474	38475	38475	He	56	" Just go . "
38478	38488	38475	38475	He	56	" I 'm sorry . I 'll call you . "
38601	38609	38610	38610	she	46	" You do n't have to stay , "
38616	38625	38610	38610	she	46	" It 's not like this meant anything . "
38637	38642	38633	38633	He	56	" Yeah . Right . "
39212	39247	39248	39248	Bob	47	" Zack , I need you . McCallum and Horton need you . Dug - E 's slipping through our fingers and I 've crunched some numbers . If we do n't sign him ... "
39262	39272	39254	39254	Zack	56	" You want me to do something with Annie ? "
39273	39279	39209	39209	Bob	47	" Yeah . Something drastic . "
39280	39313	39254	39254	Zack	56	" Are you sure this Dug - E kid wo n't sign with you if she was being herself ? Because I do n't see anything wrong with the way she is . "
39319	39334	39335	39335	Bob	47	" Me either but this kid hates people who conform . He needs excitement . "
39338	39359	39335	39335	Bob	47	" Please , Zack , I 'm begging you . Take Annie out , make an impact . Do something . "
39395	39398	39406	39406	his	56	" Sure . "
39425	39429	39430	39430	Bob	47	" Great idea , "
39437	39444	39430	39430	Bob	47	" Come pick her up later . "
40043	40048	40049	40049	he	159	" Bob needs you , "
40053	40064	40049	40049	he	159	" He ca n't run the agency without a McCallum . "
40306	40311	40312	40312	Bob	47	" Hey , Annie , "
40319	40325	40312	40312	Bob	47	" Come here a minute . "
40385	40390	40391	40391	he	56	" Zack called me , "
40412	40418	40391	40391	he	56	" Yeah ? What for ? "
40419	40436	40391	40391	he	56	" He asked if you could take the afternoon off . I said it was okay . "
40457	40460	40461	40461	He	56	" Why ? "
40485	40501	40474	40474	He	56	" He 's got a bright idea about taking you to a rally this afternoon . "
40502	40511	40461	40461	He	56	" A rally ? Like a car rally ? "
40512	40550	40551	40551	She	46	" No , a protest rally . He wants to get you into the newspapers , get some rumors started about you around town . He thinks Dug - E might go for that kind of person . "
40595	40601	40602	40602	He	56	" You okay , Bob ? "
40612	40624	40602	40602	He	56	" Yeah . It 's just been a tough few days . "
40625	40631	40604	40604	his	56	" Anything wrong with Doris ? "
40632	40639	40640	40640	He	56	" No , she 's fine . "
40644	40663	40640	40640	He	56	" Do n't worry . Just get Dug - E to sign this contract and everything'll be okay . "
40973	40975	40989	40989	him	56	" Thanks "
41009	41020	41021	41021	he	56	" I take it you 're still angry with me , "
41025	41051	41021	41021	he	56	" Yes . No . Okay , yes , annoyed I guess . But I 'll get over it . It 's no big deal . "
41065	41093	41062	41062	He	56	" Right . Good . You had me worried for a while — I thought I might be getting those flowers shoved up my nose back there . "
41099	41117	41062	41062	He	56	" Now why would I do that ? And how did you know lilies are my favorite ? "
41118	41123	41062	41062	He	56	" Bob told me . "
41126	41140	41141	41141	she	46	" So explain to me why we 're going to a protest rally , "
41157	41208	41141	41141	she	46	" Street cred . It 'll get you into the papers , people will talk — especially after I mention it at Louisa 's party — and you 'll become an instant celebrity around town . Dug - E will hear about it and he 'll think you 're cool . "
41209	41226	41240	41240	he	835	" Sounds ingenious but how will you get me in the papers in the first place ? "
41227	41233	41234	41234	She	46	" Leave it to me . "
41252	41266	41267	41267	He	835	" You 're not going to make me do anything illegal are you ? "
41270	41316	41267	41267	He	835	" Not unless you want to . I know a couple of photographers and journalists who 'll be there . I 'll slip them a few dollars to take a photo of you in the crowd and to spell your name correctly . No sweat . "
41317	41341	41240	41240	he	835	" But Dug - E 's from out of town — do you really think he 'll hear about me on the grapevine ? "
41342	41374	41240	41240	he	835	" Just to be sure , we 'll slide the newspaper under his hotel door and I 'll get a few people to mention your name in his presence . Easy . "
41472	41483	41484	41484	she	836	" They only had one T - shirt I suppose ? "
41502	41509	41484	41484	she	836	" It 's not my image . "
41510	41516	41484	41484	she	836	" But it 's mine ? "
41517	41527	41532	41532	yours	843	" Who knows what your image is , Babe . "
41624	41628	41629	41629	Zack	56	" Oh hell ! "
41645	41652	41639	41639	he	56	" My car 's being towed ! "
41677	41687	41688	41688	He	56	" Wait here until I get this sorted out . "
42016	42020	42022	42035	a long - haired kid dressed in the same T - shirt as Annie	864	" Good going , "
42037	42042	42022	42035	a long - haired kid dressed in the same T - shirt as Annie	864	" We showed 'em . "
42211	42214	42232	42232	she	873	" Wow , "
42241	42258	42232	42232	she	873	" You 've got a set of lungs on you , Girl . Way to go . "
42259	42262	42264	42277	the same kid who 'd spoken to her in the back of the van	874	" Yeah , "
42279	42289	42290	42290	She	46	" You tell them pigs where it 's at . "
42418	42421	42422	42422	he	56	" Jeez , "
42428	42440	42422	42422	he	56	" I 'm sorry , Annie . I 'm so sorry . "
42520	42526	42527	42527	He	56	" Did they hurt you ? "
42537	42545	42527	42527	He	56	" If they did , I 'll — "
42546	42551	42552	42552	She	46	" I 'm fine . "
42561	42571	42552	42552	She	46	" How did you get me out so fast ? "
42572	42599	42600	42600	He	56	" I know a couple of high - ranking cops . I told them you were n't involved and they put the paperwork through straight away . "
42616	42624	42600	42600	He	56	" Are you sure you 're okay ? "
42634	42654	42628	42628	He	56	" I should n't have left you . I should have known you 'd end up getting into trouble . "
42673	42678	42655	42655	He	56	" Gee , thanks . "
42710	42718	42719	42719	He	56	" I had a feeling about today . "
42743	42750	42719	42719	He	56	" I 'll take you home . "
42762	42782	42730	42730	he	56	" No , that 's okay , you can drop me back at the office . I 'm fine . "
42783	42798	42730	42730	he	56	" Yeah , but I 'm a nervous wreck . I need a drink . "
42815	42822	42805	42805	he	56	" What are we doing here ? "
42823	42861	42862	42862	He	56	" I thought I 'd show you where I came from . Ed 's Place was like a home to me years ago , before I made my money . I drop in sometimes to say hi . "
42865	42886	42862	42862	He	56	" Thought I 'd bring you here since you 've now got a record . You 'll fit right in . "
42887	42895	42862	42862	He	56	" A record ! But I thought — "
42896	42903	42904	42904	His	56	" Relax , I was joking . "
42908	42917	42904	42904	His	56	" I got them to drop the charges . "
42981	42988	42990	42992	the burly barman	896	" Been a while , DiMarco , "
43000	43008	42990	42992	the burly barman	896	" What brings you back here today ? "
43009	43016	43017	43018	The barman	444	" A clash with the cops . "
43106	43114	43115	43116	A man	118	" DiMarco , long time no see . "
43202	43205	43206	43206	he	92	" Nice , "
43211	43220	43206	43206	he	92	" Too nice for a bloke like you . "
43221	43229	43230	43230	Zack	56	" We used to be room mates , "
43235	43271	43272	43272	He	92	" Mike came to LA around the same time I did . Neither of us had any money but somehow we managed to survive in a tiny apartment in one of LA 's seedier suburbs . "
43275	43301	43272	43272	He	92	" It was the worst place I 've ever lived in . The rats were bigger than the cats . Remember that place , Mike ? "
43302	43311	43312	43312	Annie	46	" Remember it ! I still live there . "
43352	43360	43361	43361	she	46	" So what are you doing here ? "
43364	43372	43373	43373	He	92	" I 've come for a drink . "
43386	43398	43373	43373	He	92	" I think she means what are you doing in LA . "
43399	43402	43403	43403	Mike	92	" Oh . "
43425	43434	43416	43416	He	92	" Looking for the love of my life . "
43435	43446	43447	43447	she	46	" Like I said , what are you doing here ? "
43453	43467	43468	43468	He	92	" I like this girl . Cynical . Smartass . Just my type . "
43481	43488	43468	43468	He	92	" Definitely not yours , DiMarco . "
43500	43509	43510	43510	Mike	92	" So what do you do , Sweetheart ? "
43516	43522	43510	43510	Mike	92	" I 'm an agent . "
43555	43558	43559	43559	she	46	" Music , "
43588	43603	43604	43604	He	56	" So what 's a gorgeous girl like you doing with this old loser ? "
43614	43626	43627	43627	He	56	" Riding motorbikes , getting arrested , that sort of thing . "
43630	43637	43627	43627	He	56	" Sounds just like old times . "
43650	43660	43646	43646	Mike	92	" Seriously , what are you doing with him ? "
43674	43680	43681	43681	Annie	46	" What do you mean ? "
43685	43693	43694	43694	he	56	" Well , let 's just say , "
43699	43706	43707	43707	he	56	" that you , sweet Annie , "
43716	43724	43707	43707	he	56	" are way too good for him . "
43747	43755	43756	43756	he	56	" What are you two talking about ? "
43773	43798	43756	43756	he	56	" Annie here said she wanted to run away with me , but I told her she should take pity on you and stay . "
43809	43836	43799	43799	He	56	" He 's not all that bad , Sweetheart . You just have to accept him for what he is — a womanizing commitment - phobe . "
43870	43874	43875	43875	She	46	" I have . "
43886	43895	43875	43875	She	46	" I 've learned to live with it . "
43902	43911	43897	43897	she	46	" Now I make the most of it . "
43936	43941	43897	43897	she	46	" Yeah ? How ? "
43998	44009	44010	44010	he	56	" I think you need to go to the bathroom , "
44013	44019	44010	44010	he	56	" No I do n't . "
44028	44041	44020	44020	Mike	92	" Maybe I had a few too many beers . Excuse me . "
44092	44098	44079	44079	Zack	56	" What are you doing ? "
44099	44102	44103	44103	Mike	92	" What ? "
44109	44119	44103	44103	Mike	92	" I thought you were n't interested in her . "
44143	44146	44147	44147	Mike	92	" Okay , "
44150	44170	44147	44147	Mike	92	" I 'll go . But , mate , if she 's the one , then go for it . "
44171	44182	44183	44183	Mike	92	" She 's not . We 're just ... friends . "
44186	44223	44183	44183	Mike	92	" Well , I have to admit , she 's not your usual type . That 's why I thought there was something between you two . I thought maybe you were ready to settle down . "
44224	44230	44231	44231	Zack	56	" No way . Never . "
44246	44253	44254	44254	He	92	" Then let that girl go . "
44261	44276	44254	44254	He	92	" You 're not being fair on her . She 's a great girl — "
44277	44282	44283	44283	Mike	92	" I know that . "
44288	44302	44303	44303	He	92	" Yeah , I can see you 're really not interested in her . "
44311	44320	44321	44321	Zack	56	" Maybe I should warn her what a — "
44347	44365	44331	44331	He	56	" Do n't say a word to her . In fact , maybe you should just leave . "
44381	44413	44414	44414	He	92	" Since you 're a good mate , I will . And I wo n't hold this conversation against you since you 're in love and too stupid to realize it . "
44504	44509	44492	44492	Mike	92	" I 'm off . "
44510	44513	44473	44473	Annie	46	" Already ? "
44514	44532	44533	44533	She	46	" Yep , things to do , agents to suck up to , that sort of thing . "
44586	44589	44590	44590	he	56	" What ? "
44593	44605	44590	44590	he	56	" Since when do straight men go to the bathroom together ? "
44609	44619	44606	44606	He	56	" I just wanted a quiet word with him . "
44620	44623	44581	44581	he	56	" About ? "
44624	44628	44629	44629	She	46	" Guy stuff . "
44632	44646	44629	44629	She	46	" You told him to stop flirting with me , did n't you ? "
44651	44667	44647	44647	He	56	" Mike 's a great guy but he does n't know when to let up . "
44668	44678	44581	44581	he	56	" So what did he say in his defense ? "
44679	44685	44686	44686	Zack	56	" That you encouraged him . "
44707	44710	44711	44711	he	56	" Annie , "
44717	44725	44711	44711	he	56	" why did you flirt with him ? "
44726	44729	44730	44730	He	56	" Practice ? "
44737	44757	44734	44734	his	56	" Do n't get me wrong , Mike 's a great guy , but he 's not your type . "
44808	44815	44816	44816	He	56	" And what is my type ? "
44819	44823	44816	44816	He	56	" Not him . "
45029	45034	45035	45035	he	56	" I 'm sorry , "
45038	45042	45035	45035	he	56	" For what ? "
45048	45053	45043	45043	she	912	" For wanting you . "
45351	45358	45359	45359	he	56	" I ... can't ... wait , "
45793	45806	45807	45807	he	56	" Let 's see if we can make it to the bedroom , "
45823	45829	45830	45830	she	46	" How far is it ? "
45836	45839	45830	45830	she	46	" Far . "
45840	45847	45816	45816	He	56	" We might not make it . "
45848	45870	45816	45816	He	56	" All we can do is try . We owe it to these tired old bodies to find a comfortable mattress . "
45871	45878	45830	45830	she	46	" Who 're you calling old ? "
45879	45896	45816	45816	He	56	" Easy for you to say , you landed on top of me when we fell . "
45943	45959	45960	45960	She	46	" So what do you want to do until we 're ready for round three ? "
45973	45980	45981	45981	He	56	" How long will that take ? "
45984	45993	45981	45981	He	56	" I should be asking you that question . "
46002	46012	46013	46013	He	56	" How about a tour of the house first ? "
46099	46107	46108	46108	She	46	" Why 's this one turned down ? "
46142	46146	46147	46147	He	56	" Your parents ? "
46150	46157	46147	46147	He	56	" They divorced shortly after that . "
46158	46163	46173	46173	he	56	" Zack , I — "
46164	46172	46173	46173	he	56	" It was a long time ago , "
46244	46251	46252	46252	she	46	" And what 's happened here ? "
46285	46292	46293	46293	He	56	" Did n't you like her ? "
46296	46332	46293	46293	He	56	" That 's my great grand mother . She thought she was ugly so she inked out her face in every photograph . A shame really because I have no idea what she looked like . "
46333	46348	46371	46371	She	46	" Maybe I should try that next time I have a horrible picture taken . "
46349	46352	46353	46353	he	56	" So , "
46365	46370	46353	46353	he	56	" You like it ? "
46387	46394	46371	46371	She	46	" Well , I do n't . "
46395	46403	46404	46404	He	56	" Oh ? But it 's perfect . "
46407	46415	46404	46404	He	56	" I prefer my ranch in Montana . "
46494	46497	46487	46487	She	46	" Why ? "
46498	46532	46487	46487	She	46	" It 's more ... homely . This is all Hollywood glitz . You may not believe this , but it appeared in House and Garden about a piece on bachelor 's homes . "
46533	46536	46487	46487	She	46	" Really ? "
46537	46553	46487	46487	She	46	" They liked it too , but I always felt it had no ... soul . "
46554	46564	46565	46565	She	46	" Hmmm . Well Montana 's too far away . "
46580	46605	46606	46606	He	56	" And right now my apartment 's too far away too . So I guess we 'll have to settle for this horrible place . "
46614	46617	46606	46606	He	56	" Mmmmm . "
46618	46625	46606	46606	He	56	" Where was that bedroom again ? "
46920	46925	46926	46926	Annie	46	" Mmmm , Zack . "
46941	46945	46946	46946	he	56	" You awake ? "
46968	46978	46961	46961	She	46	" I am now . What 's the matter ? "
46994	47004	47005	47005	She	46	" Look , Annie , we need to talk . "
47009	47013	47005	47005	She	46	" What about ? "
47023	47038	47014	47014	He	56	" I really like you . And I do n't want to hurt you . "
47129	47152	47121	47121	She	46	" You do n't want me to get the wrong idea , but this is just sex . Is n't that right ? "
47153	47156	47157	47157	He	56	" Annie . "
47199	47210	47193	47193	She	46	" Baby , I do n't know what to say ... "
47211	47216	47217	47217	She	46	" Then do n't . "
47234	47247	47217	47217	She	46	" I get the picture . No need to spell it out . "
47248	47278	47279	47279	She	46	" But I like you . If things were different , if I wanted to settle down , then you 'd definitely be at the top of my list . "
47290	47295	47296	47296	She	46	" I 'm flattered . "
47306	47311	47303	47303	He	56	" Annie , wait . "
47312	47318	47279	47279	She	46	" Call me a cab . "
47319	47326	47327	47327	She	46	" No , do n't go . "
47332	47381	47327	47327	She	46	" I 'm leaving . I 'm not staying here one second longer . You 've made yourself clear , Zack , and I 'm glad you did . You know , I thought I could do this , but I ca n't . I just ca n't . "
47382	47399	47400	47400	He	56	" I understand . That 's one of the things I like about you . Stay . "
47410	47417	47405	47405	she	46	" We 'll talk about it . "
47423	47437	47418	47418	She	46	" The least you can do is let me leave with my dignity . "
47484	47489	47490	47490	He	56	" I 'm sorry . "
47498	47505	47490	47490	He	56	" Can we still be friends ? "
47544	47555	47556	47556	He	56	" I 'll wait outside . Good night , Zack . "
47569	47580	47581	47581	he	56	" I 'll pick you up tomorrow night at eight , "
47617	47623	47614	47614	he	56	" For Louisa 's party . "
48341	48343	48333	48333	his	56	" wow "
48377	48380	48381	48381	he	56	" Ready ? "
48444	48454	48436	48436	They	1007	" I thought we were going to Louisa 's . "
48455	48467	48418	48418	He	56	" We are . She lives a few streets from me . "
48468	48497	48498	48498	He	56	" You came all the way to pick me up when she lives near you ! Why did n't you tell me ? I would 've driven myself . "
48501	48506	48498	48498	He	56	" Forget about it . "
48661	48674	48675	48675	Annie	46	" You did n't tell me this was Louisa Mondeo 's party , "
48685	48691	48675	48675	Annie	46	" You did n't ask . "
48736	48741	48742	48742	Louisa	76	" Zack , Daaahling . "
48749	48770	48742	48742	Louisa	76	" We have n't seen you out and about for sooo long . What brings you to my little soiree ? "
48877	48880	48870	48870	he	56	" a friend "
48882	48886	48887	48887	She	76	" How nice . "
48910	48919	48892	48892	Annie	46	" What did you say your name was ? "
48920	48924	48889	48889	her	76	" Annie McCallum . "
48925	48931	48932	48932	Zack	56	" She 's an agent , "
48935	48938	48932	48932	Zack	56	" Really ? "
48957	48961	48962	48962	Annie	46	" Music agent , "
48971	48980	48981	48981	She	76	" Oh . But you look so familiar . "
48990	48997	48981	48981	She	76	" Have I met her before ? "
48998	49016	49017	49017	Louisa	76	" She was in today 's papers . She got arrested at a protest outside City Hall . "
49033	49052	49053	49053	She	76	" Really ! How interesting ! Trust you to go out with a girl like that , Zack . "
49161	49165	49166	49166	he	56	" Just relax , "
49170	49180	49166	49166	he	56	" Remember , you 're better than everyone here . "

49389	49414	49386	49386	Zack	56	" Cuts , that sort of thing . Lucky she knows people in the right places or she 'd still be in a cell . "
49415	49419	49421	49423	the original speaker	1033	" No shit , "
49503	49509	49510	49510	he	1033	" That 's so cool , "

50507	50513	50505	50505	Rick	95	" Get out of here , "
50562	50568	50569	50569	she	46	" What are you doing ? "
50623	50631	50632	50632	He	56	" I should ask you that question . "
50654	50664	50639	50639	she	46	" I was practicing . Like you taught me . "
50835	50838	50839	50839	He	56	" Annie ... "
50868	50876	50877	50877	He	56	" Annie , do n't do this . "
50889	50897	50884	50884	she	46	" Do n't do what , Zack ? "
50917	50933	50905	50905	her	46	" Do n't flirt with anyone ? Do n't watch you flirting with other women ? "
50934	50940	50884	50884	she	46	" I was n't flirting — "
50941	50951	50884	50884	she	46	" No ? Her breasts were all over you . "
50952	50958	50905	50905	her	46	" I did n't notice — "
50959	51046	51047	51047	She	1057	" Did n't notice ! Are you blind ? And now you have the gall to get angry with me for doing exactly what you wanted — flirting . Well , let me tell you , I 'm tired of your contrary attitude . You want everything and nothing . You want to sleep with me but you do n't want the emotion that goes along with it . Then you tell me I ca n't spread my wings a little and flirt with other men . "
51062	51108	51047	51047	She	1057	" I thought this was what you wanted me to be . Everything I am tonight , everything I 've done , is because of you . You showed me how to be this flirtatious , popular woman . Now you want me to stop . "
51114	51134	51111	51111	her	1057	" You 're exactly the man I thought you were when we met , Zack DiMarco , an arrogant — "
51224	51229	51230	51230	Zack	56	" Are you okay ? "
51311	51319	51305	51305	He	56	" Annie , where are you going ? "
51320	51323	51305	51305	He	56	" Home . "
51324	51330	51305	51305	He	56	" I 'll drive you . "
51331	51345	51305	51305	He	56	" You 'd better , because I 'm not waiting for a cab . "
51549	51552	51553	51553	he	56	" Annie , "
51568	51574	51553	51553	he	56	" We need to talk . "
51598	51610	51611	51611	he	56	" You 're not going anywhere until we sort this out , "
51614	51637	51611	51611	he	56	" Sort what out , Zack ? That you 're an arrogant jerk ? Well , I 've already sorted that out . "
51638	51649	51650	51650	He	56	" Stop it , Annie , and listen to me . "
51679	51682	51683	51683	he	56	" Please , "
51693	51698	51688	51688	She	1069	" I 'm listening . "
51728	51733	51736	51736	he	56	" I 'm sorry , "
51740	51744	51736	51736	he	56	" For what ? "
51756	51761	51751	51751	he	56	" For changing you . "
51803	51807	51793	51793	he	56	" Changing me ! "
51818	51824	51810	51810	her	1069	" Changing me into what ? "
51836	51880	51810	51810	her	1069	" Bob wanted to turn you into a wild child . A woman who enjoys life and likes to have fun . I think I did my job too well . I was n't expecting you to flirt with every man you met . "
51953	52069	52070	52070	He	1081	" You arrogant jerk ! You think you can actually change me ! What sort of egotistical man are you ? And what sort of pathetic idiot do you think I am ? Do you think I 'm so weak that I 'd actually be influenced permanently by anything that you 've supposedly taught me over the last few days ? Either you think I 'm incredibly shallow or you think you have a power over me . Is that how you see me , Zack , as a blank canvas that you can just paint a personality onto ? Turn me into your dream woman ? What 's the next step ? Plastic surgery ? "
52096	52102	52103	52103	he	1081	" Now wait a minute , "
52116	52129	52103	52103	he	1081	" I do n't think that at all and you know it . "
52130	52188	52189	52189	He	1081	" I do n't know it . In fact , I know nothing about you , Zack DiMarco . You 're as much a mystery to me as you were when we first met . And that 's probably a good thing because I do n't think I want to know what makes the real Zack tick . "
52848	52852	52853	52853	he	47	" Feeling okay ? "
52856	52859	52860	52860	she	46	" Sure , "
52863	52886	52860	52860	she	46	" Just twiddling my thumbs until Dug - E arrives . Have you sent someone to the airport to pick him up ? "
52887	52890	52927	52927	her	46	" Yes . "
52891	52898	52927	52927	her	46	" Is the conference room ready ? "
52899	52902	52860	52860	she	46	" Yes . "
52903	52916	52927	52927	her	46	" What about a packet of M&M 's ? He likes those . "
52917	52920	52927	52927	her	46	" Done . "
52921	52924	52925	52925	She	46	" Good . "
52930	52977	52927	52927	her	46	" And I should tell you , I 'm not changing my appearance just because Dug - E expects to see a hip , groovy person . He 's getting me , Annie McCallum , and the best service the McCallum and Horton Agency can offer . "
52991	52996	52997	52997	He	47	" Okay by me . "
53009	53023	53024	53024	He	47	" Read this to take your mind off things before he gets here . "
53192	53218	53176	53177	The writer	1104	" Great . I lose an account before I even get it and he makes a fortune . There 's no justice in this world . "
53237	53240	53241	53241	she	46	" Typical , "
53264	53285	53286	53286	Annie	46	" McCallum and Horton agent , Annie McCallum , the hottest girl in town this summer after her recent arrest . "
53376	53385	53386	53386	she	46	" Did you read the article about Zack ? "
53389	53392	53365	53365	she	46	" Yeah . "
53396	53408	53393	53393	He	47	" Which reminds me , what did you do to him ? "
53409	53412	53365	53365	she	46	" Huh ? "
53413	53448	53365	53365	she	46	" He only sells an entire company when he 's angry or upset . And since you two have been together a lot lately I wondered if it had something to do with you . "
53449	53475	53365	53365	she	46	" Me ? I think you 're over - reacting a little . I do n't have any influence over Zack 's actions at all . "
53483	53495	53480	53480	Bob	47	" That 's what you think . The guy 's smitten . "
53496	53499	53365	53365	she	46	" Smitten ? "
53500	53513	53514	53514	He	47	" He called here five times the other day looking for you . "
53557	53564	53551	53551	Bob	47	" This article just confirms it . "
53565	53568	53571	53571	she	46	" Oh , "
53675	53682	53683	53683	she	1115	" Dug - E 's here ! "
53703	53707	53708	53708	Annie	46	" Show time , "
53789	53799	53780	53780	Annie	46	" Do n't call us , we 'll call you "
53813	53819	53820	53820	Annie	46	" I have to go , "
53844	53855	53841	53841	his	47	" I thought we could celebrate with a drink first . "
53856	53873	53874	53874	He	47	" That 's a little premature do n't you think ? He has n't signed yet . "
53889	53898	53899	53899	His	47	" He will . I can feel it . "
53908	53916	53903	53903	he	47	" Are you going to see Zack ? "
53928	53943	53917	53917	She	46	" Never again . He 's made it perfectly clear he 's not interested . "
53944	53947	53948	53948	He	47	" Oh . "
53951	53964	53948	53948	He	47	" In that case , there 's probably something you should know . "
53987	53990	53970	53970	she	46	" What ? "
53991	53997	53998	53998	She	46	" I set you up . "
54003	54009	53998	53998	She	46	" What do you mean ? "
54013	54046	54010	54010	He	47	" It was one of those spur of the moment things . I 'd often thought you two would be perfect for each other and when the opportunity arose I took it . "
54059	54090	54091	54091	he	47	" I 'm sorry it did n't work out . I just thought you could be the one to change him . You are perfect for him , you know , "
54156	54165	54150	54150	you	1123	" What do you mean , change him ? "
54166	54202	54208	54208	Bob	47	" It 's about time the boy settled down . I know that , but he does n't , or does n't want to admit it . That 's why he never dates relationship women . "
54203	54207	54208	54208	Bob	47	" Relationship women ? "
54211	54240	54208	54208	Bob	47	" He only dates the sort who just want to party and paint their toenails pretty colors . He avoids the sort of women he should be dating . "
54241	54246	54247	54247	she	1124	" Women like me ? "
54251	54275	54247	54247	she	1124	" Exactly . You 're just what he needs . I thought he might figure that out after spending some time with you . "
54289	54300	54278	54278	his	47	" Obviously he 's a bigger fool than I thought . "
54301	54304	54278	54278	his	47	" Obviously . "
54581	54586	54587	54587	He	56	" This is ridiculous . "
54991	54998	54981	54981	she	46	" That was quick ... Oh . "
55055	55062	55068	55068	he	56	" What are you doing here ? "
55063	55067	55068	55068	he	56	" Bad timing ? "
55080	55088	55071	55071	His	56	" Do you want me to leave ? "
55089	55098	55099	55099	Zack	56	" No . I was expecting someone else . "
55134	55140	55104	55104	his	56	" Who were you expecting ? "
55160	55171	55156	55156	He	56	" Just Bob for our regular after - work tryst . "
55184	55188	55189	55189	she	46	" Just kidding , "
55199	55214	55189	55189	she	46	" He 's bringing around Dug - E 's contract for me to sign . "
55225	55248	55222	55222	he	56	" So you got Dug - E ? Good . I knew you would . Was it the bike that convinced him ? "
55249	55252	55253	55253	She	46	" No . "
55300	55355	55356	55356	She	46	" I went as myself . No motorbike , no flirting , no tight leather pants . I could n't represent him as someone I was n't . I 'm not so bad really . And anyone who does n't like me as I am can lump it . That goes for you too . "
55474	55477	55478	55478	he	56	" Good , "
55481	55498	55478	55478	he	56	" I like the real Annie better . I 'm sure Dug - E will too . "
55546	55553	55536	55536	He	56	" Um , Zack , we can't—. "
55573	55605	55560	55560	He	56	" Ssh . I 've got something I have to say or I 'll explode . I 've missed you , Baby . These last two days have been ... boring . "
55606	55609	55610	55610	He	56	" Boring ? "
55617	55632	55610	55610	He	56	" Okay , they 've been worse than boring . They 've been hell . "
55675	55678	55679	55679	she	46	" Good , "
55683	55692	55679	55679	she	46	" They 've been hell for me too . "
55744	55747	55738	55738	She	46	" Annie ? "
55748	55754	55755	55755	She	46	" No more , Zack . "
55768	55787	55757	55757	her	46	" I need to know what I am to you . I need to know what you want . "
55798	55803	55757	55757	her	46	" I want you . "
55804	55809	55810	55810	Her	46	" In what way ? "
55884	55901	55881	55881	She	46	" I see . You 've made yourself clear . I think you should go now . "
55902	55911	55926	55926	she	46	" But , Annie , we had fun . "
55912	55918	55923	55923	her	46	" Yeah , we did . "
55930	55972	55923	55923	her	46	" But we want different things out of this relationship and you 're not being fair if you keep stringing me along . I ca n't do it anymore . I 'm just not like that . I know that now . "
56155	56164	56146	56146	his	56	" I think I need to sit down . "
56289	56292	56293	56293	he	56	" Annie , "
56366	56376	56377	56377	he	56	" I 'm sorry I put you through this , "
56380	56391	56377	56377	he	56	" It 's just I did n't know until now . "
56392	56398	56399	56399	Her	46	" Did n't know what ? "
56403	56411	56399	56399	Her	46	" That I love you , Annie . "
56524	56532	56533	56533	she	46	" I thought you prefer busty blondes , "
56566	56586	56557	56557	she	46	" No . It was easier to date them because I 'd never fall for that sort of girl . "
56587	56600	56607	56607	her	46	" But you said yourself , you do n't want a relationship . "
56623	56634	56635	56635	he	56	" I never wanted to end up like my parents , "
56653	56723	56724	56724	He	56	" My Dad gave up his dreams for my mother . And because of that , he hated her . Not straight away . They were madly in love when they married . But with the jobs and the pressure of raising a large family , he lost his talent for song writing . He could have been successful . Bob made him successful after he died , but ... "
56732	56745	56724	56724	He	56	" And you do n't want to end up like your father ? "
56749	56761	56746	56746	Annie	46	" Me either . It seems we both have father issues . "
56762	56781	56782	56782	He	56	" Yeah , well , you 've come to terms with yours . Now it 's my turn . "
56786	56816	56782	56782	He	56	" So be gentle with me , Annie . Outright rejection is n't easy on a commitment - phobe who 's made up his mind to make a commitment . "
56825	56838	56820	56820	her	46	" So you meant what you just said ? You love me ? "
56839	56842	56843	56843	he	56	" Yes , "
56880	56883	56875	56875	he	56	" Annie ? "
56907	56921	56895	56895	She	46	" I 'm not like those other women . I want it all . "
56932	56943	56922	56922	He	56	" I know . That 's why I love you . "
56957	56963	56964	56964	she	46	" I love you too , "
56974	56986	56964	56964	she	46	" So does this mean you 'll sleep with me now ? "
56987	56991	56992	56992	He	56	" Every day . "
57020	57028	57029	57029	she	46	" I have a confession to make , "
57032	57050	57051	57051	She	46	" Unless you 're going to tell me you 're an alien , I do n't care . "
57058	57080	57051	57051	She	46	" My confession is that I was n't really flirting with Rick the other night . I was just pretending to . "
57081	57085	57086	57086	She	46	" I know . "
57093	57096	57088	57088	her	46	" How ? "
57097	57103	57104	57104	He	56	" Because I know you . "
57112	57120	57104	57104	He	56	" And you 're a terrible flirt . "
57121	57124	57125	57125	She	46	" Oh . "
57128	57140	57125	57125	She	46	" I feel like I hardly know you at all sometimes . "
57141	57146	57104	57104	He	56	" That 's okay . "
57180	57199	57178	57178	Annie	46	" We 're going to have the rest of our lives to find out everything about one another . "
57200	57226	57240	57240	He	56	" As long as we spend the rest of our lives on your ranch in Montana . I think I 've had enough of LA . "
57227	57239	57242	57242	himself	56	" Really ? But you 've lived here your whole life . "
57260	57285	57286	57286	He	56	" I 've realized I do n't quite fit the LA image . My idea of a great night is going to bed early . "
57297	57303	57286	57286	He	56	" Sounds good to me . "
57948	57951	58017	58018	The man	308	" What ? "
57961	57964	57965	57965	Abbey	103	" Um , "
57973	57979	57980	57980	She	103	" My name 's Abbey . "
57987	58016	57980	57980	She	103	" I 'm here to inform you , Mr. Vane , that you 've been selected to receive a free massage , compliments of Le Miridian hotel management . "
58102	58105	58106	58106	She	103	" Wait ! "
58116	58121	58122	58122	she	103	" It 's free , "
58126	58154	58122	58122	she	103	" No thanks . I just arrived in Melbourne , I 'm tired and I want to get some sleep . I do n't need a massage . "
58285	58293	58294	58294	Her	103	" Jeez , are you all right ? "
58406	58410	58411	58411	he	308	" Come inside , "
58419	58426	58411	58411	he	308	" Run them under cold water . "
58480	58485	58486	58486	he	308	" How 's that ? "
58587	58590	58591	58591	he	308	" Okay ? "
58634	58637	58638	58638	she	103	" Fine , "
58647	58655	58638	58638	she	103	" Thanks for taking care of me . "
58656	58674	58638	58638	she	103	" You know you should 've been more careful . You could 've done some serious damage . "
