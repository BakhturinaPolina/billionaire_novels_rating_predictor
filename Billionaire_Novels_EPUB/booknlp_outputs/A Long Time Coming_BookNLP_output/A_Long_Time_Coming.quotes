292	297	264	266	a lanky guy	240	“ Not a problem , ”
340	347	348	348	he	240	“ What are you looking for ? ”
365	368	351	351	he	240	“ Uh . ”
376	398	369	369	I	0	“ Room 209 . But I keep getting turned around because it does n’t seem like there ’s a room 209 . ”
406	410	369	369	I	0	“ Scrabble nerd ? ”
411	414	415	415	I	0	“ What ? ”
424	444	418	418	He	240	“ It ’s okay . I ’m part of the SSS . Room 209 is hidden for a reason . ”
885	911	912	912	I	0	“ You know , it was nice talking to you , but I think I ’ll just go look for the room myself . Thanks . ”
929	939	924	924	him	65	“ Not going to find room 209 down there . ”
965	974	956	956	his	65	“ I was n’t actually going that way , ”

987	994	956	956	his	65	“ I was faking you out . ”
995	1000	1001	1001	he	65	“ Were you now ? ”
1009	1018	1001	1001	he	65	“ Why would you be faking me out ? ”
1032	1065	1029	1029	I	0	“ Because between your ungodly thick mustache and your shaggy hair , you look like a predator . How can I be sure that you ’re not attempting to snatch me up ? ”
1078	1104	1070	1070	he	65	“ You know , you ’re the third person who said I ca n’t rock this mustache . I thought I was looking pretty legit . ”
1114	1136	1070	1070	he	65	“ Your mustache is offensive . I ’m pretty sure it would make even the most randy of women go dry . ”
1180	1188	1178	1178	buddy	261	“ Uh , I do n’t know — ”
1377	1410	1411	1411	I	0	“ You know , I ’ve never had a girl tell me that I possess the uncanny ability to dehydrate the nether regions of the female race with just my facial hair . ”

1568	1573	1574	1574	I	0	“ Actually . . . ”
1588	1635	1574	1574	I	0	“ There is no invite , and I have no idea what this door leads to . I just know that I ’m supposed to be here at ten twenty - three , and I am , so therefore , I believe I should gain entrance . ”
1636	1645	1646	1647	Slurpee Boy	65	“ But you forgot the ching - chang , ”
1655	1663	1646	1647	Slurpee Boy	65	“ There was no ching - chang , ”
1669	1752	1664	1664	I	0	“ It clearly said , knock three times , kick the footer , and then say walla - walla - bing - bang . I know this because I read the , uh . . . thing , twenty - seven times precisely . So either this is not the right door , which perhaps it ’s not , or you two have not read the instructions yourself , and in which case , I demand to speak to an authoritative human . ”
1753	1758	1759	1760	Slurpee Boy	65	“ An authoritative human ? ”
1763	1770	1759	1760	Slurpee Boy	65	“ Is that a professional term ? ”
1771	1778	1779	1779	I	0	“ Dumbing it down for you , ”
1784	1794	1779	1779	I	0	“ You know , since you have that look . ”
1795	1799	1800	1800	he	65	“ What look ? ”
1803	1810	1800	1800	he	65	“ One that ’s lacking intelligence . ”
1861	1872	1856	1856	he	65	“ She ’s good , man . Let her in . ”

2206	2225	2226	2226	He	65	“ It ’s mine . I ’m also the authoritative person , as you like to call it . ”
2232	2267	2226	2226	He	65	“ Breaker Cane . It ’s nice to meet you . Maybe as you hang out with us more , you can lower yourself to my lack of intelligence on a more personal level . ”
2302	2315	2296	2296	Lia	168	“ Uh , yeah . . . I did n’t really mean — ”
2316	2327	2328	2328	He	65	“ No , no . Do n’t take it back . ”
2334	2348	2331	2331	his	65	“ I like your brutal and brash honesty . Made me feel alive . ”
2352	2361	2349	2349	He	65	“ Oh , okay . In that case . ”
2367	2421	2362	2362	I	0	“ Although your room seems like a dream to explore , you could have tucked the corners of your bed better , not quite ‘ nurse ’s corner ’ tight , your framed picture of Rory Gilmore is crooked , and you have to get rid of the mustache . It ’s atrocious . ”
2437	2514	2428	2428	his	65	“ Still trying to perfect the nurse ’s corner . If you have expertise in this endeavor , then , by all means , present a tutorial . The room I share a wall with plays music loud enough that they force Rory to dance , making her crooked . I ’ve given up . And the mustache , well , I thought it looked good . Seems to me everyone ’s been lying to me . ”
2515	2520	2362	2362	I	0	“ They have been . ”
2521	2543	2428	2428	his	65	“ But you do n’t seem to have that ability . . . to lie to someone to forsake their feelings . ”
2544	2553	2554	2554	I	0	“ Depends on the moment and the person . ”
2561	2595	2554	2554	I	0	“ You seemed sturdy enough to handle the truth , and also , stressful situations — i.e. not knowing where the room was — snatching any social decorum I might have stored away . ”
2596	2606	2428	2428	his	65	“ Well , that can only mean one thing . ”
2612	2617	2609	2609	I	0	“ What ’s that ? ”
2618	2635	2636	2636	I	0	“ That there is no other choice than to become the greatest friends of all time . ”
2639	2645	2636	2636	I	0	“ Only if you shave . ”
2646	2659	2660	2660	He	65	“ Ehhh , that ’s something we might have to work out . ”
2668	2691	2660	2660	He	65	“ Given that you are the only new recruit to the Secret Scrabble Society , you must be Ophelia Fairweather - Fern . ”
2692	2724	2725	2725	He	65	“ That would be me . But just call me Lia . My entire name is far too many syllables for anyone to carry around , let alone my first name . ”
2728	2769	2725	2725	He	65	“ Your name was a check in the plus column during tryouts . But your brutal use of words we ’ve never even heard of was the real reason you were chosen , especially since we play on a timer . ”
2770	2829	2660	2660	He	65	“ That was an added challenge I appreciated . Although the timer startled me at first and took a second for me to get used to . That and not being able to see your new letters or the gameboard until your turn started . I had a lot of fun . I ’m glad I was chosen . ”
2830	2837	2838	2838	He	65	“ It was an easy choice . ”
2845	2865	2838	2838	He	65	“ Everyone , this is Lia . Lia , that ’s Harley , Jarome , Christine , and Imani . ”
2892	2901	2876	2876	they	274	“ Yeah , they ’re not really social . ”
2902	2915	2916	2916	I	0	“ Well , good thing I did n’t come here to socialize . ”
2922	2928	2929	2929	Breaker	68	“ I came to play . ”
2939	2950	2929	2929	Breaker	68	“ Then what are we waiting for ? Game on . ”
2995	2999	3000	3000	he	68	“ Your move , ”
3038	3046	3023	3023	he	68	“ I know it ’s my move . ”
3047	3063	3005	3005	his	68	“ Really , because you ’ve been sitting there catatonic for at least five minutes . ”
3064	3075	3124	3124	He	68	“ I ’m making sure I have the right move . ”
3076	3083	3084	3084	He	68	“ Or any move at all . ”
3099	3105	3096	3096	his	68	“ I have a move . ”
3106	3120	3121	3121	he	68	“ One that wo n’t win you the game , though , right ? ”
3139	3150	3135	3135	his	68	“ You know , it ’s not polite to gloat . ”
3151	3174	3175	3175	I	0	“ This coming from the girl who was dancing only a few minutes ago because she had a tremendous lead on me . ”
3190	3210	3175	3175	I	0	“ It will behoove you to know that I can dish it , but I ca n’t take it . ”
3232	3236	3237	3237	He	68	“ Nice move . ”
3265	3271	3272	3272	He	68	“ But not good enough . ”
3284	3288	3272	3272	He	68	“ I win . ”
3308	3313	3305	3305	I	0	“ I had you . ”
3314	3334	3305	3305	I	0	“ Never celebrate too early . You never know what can happen at the end of a Scrabble game . ”
3335	3356	3305	3305	I	0	“ That ’s such a cheap move by the way , holding on to an S to the very end . ”
3357	3369	3305	3305	I	0	“ How did you know I was holding on to it ? ”
3370	3389	3305	3305	I	0	“ Because I watched you pick up the tile a while ago and set it to the side . ”
3390	3416	3305	3305	I	0	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re one of those players . The one who counts the tiles and knows what everyone could possibly have . ”
3417	3443	3305	3305	I	0	“ Not to that extent , but I watched you baby that tile and not touch it until now . You saved it on purpose . ”
3444	3470	3305	3305	I	0	“ When you ’re trailing by eighty points , you have to be strategic , and I was . No shame in playing the game . ”
3471	3493	3305	3305	I	0	“ I hate to admit it since you won , but it was a good game . I enjoyed the challenge . ”
3494	3510	3511	3511	He	279	“ It was a good game . You ’re going to fit in nicely here . ”
3525	3544	3519	3519	I	0	“ Your application said you ’re majoring in research and statistics . What ’s the plan after college ? ”
3545	3558	3559	3559	He	279	“ Getting my master ’s and then becoming a survey research specialist . ”
3562	3568	3569	3569	Breaker	68	“ That ’s really specific , ”
3572	3593	3569	3569	Breaker	68	“ And not a job you hear on a list of what you want to be when you grow up . ”
3594	3715	3716	3716	Breaker	68	“ Not so much , but I ’ve always been into surveys . Growing up , I loved filling them out . I spent a great deal of time filling out every survey my parents came across . I loved the idea of someone being able to listen to me and gather information to make a change . And of course , I would make surveys on my own , handwritten ones on construction paper , and pass them around at family gatherings to see how everyone enjoyed themselves . Then I would draw up a report and send out an end - of - the - year letter , showing everyone where we excelled and where we could improve . ”
3719	3732	3716	3716	Breaker	68	“ And did you find out anything constructive from these family surveys ? ”
3733	3736	3737	3737	I	0	“ Yes . ”
3754	3832	3740	3740	I	0	“ Whenever my uncle Steve decided to take his pants off after dinner , it always led to him doing the invisible hula hoop on top of the cleared - off dining table — which no one relished . I made sure to convey this to the family and Uncle Steve , but unfortunately , I have no control over their behavior . I can only survey what needs to change . Changes are made from within . ”
3833	3842	3740	3740	I	0	“ Uncle Steve sounds like a good time . ”
3843	3872	3879	3879	Breaker	68	“ He had a mustache . . . and he ’s known as the pervert in the family . So yeah , maybe you two would get along . ”
3873	3878	3879	3879	Breaker	68	“ Not a pervert , ”
3890	3898	3879	3879	Breaker	68	“ That has yet to be determined . ”
3899	3918	3919	3919	He	68	“ Can we make a quick assessment because I can assure you , I ’m not a pervert . ”
3974	3979	3980	3980	He	68	“ If you wish . ”
3989	4004	3982	3982	his	68	“ I believe the phrase you ’re reaching for is , as you wish . ”
4005	4013	3982	3982	his	68	“ Princess Bride fan , are we ? ”
4014	4050	4076	4076	himself	68	“ What ’s there not to be a fan of ? Revenge , swords , master tales of times before . It ’s got it all . Not to mention . . . Fred Savage . ”
4051	4070	4071	4071	He	68	“ I actually agree , which puts a check mark in your column of not being a pervert . ”
4083	4097	4071	4071	He	68	“ But that ’s only one check mark . There are more questions . ”
4098	4109	4076	4076	himself	68	“ Hit me . Watch me pass with flying colors . ”
4110	4142	4076	4076	himself	68	“ We shall see about that . Have you ever , since you ’ve donned the mustache , peeped into someone ’s window , preferably the sex you ’re attracted to ? ”
4143	4152	4076	4076	himself	68	“ That would be women , and no . ”
4153	4181	4076	4076	himself	68	“ Good answer . Next question , have you ever felt the need to walk into the ladies ’ room because you wanted to take a gander ? ”
4182	4214	4215	4215	My	0	“ I ’ve heard there are way more stalls , which I ’m jealous of because sometimes I just like to sit and pee . But no , I have not . ”
4220	4225	4226	4226	He	68	“ Sit and pee ? ”
4229	4234	4226	4226	He	68	“ I get lazy . ”
4235	4283	4076	4076	himself	68	“ Okay , seems like more work to sit down and pee , but to each their own . One more question . Have you ever started a club for men with mustaches and purchased mini mustache combs and creams so you can have mustache care parties ? ”
4284	4303	4304	4304	He	68	“ Wow , now that sounds like a good fucking time , but no , I have not . ”
4315	4330	4304	4304	He	68	“ So . . . have you deduced that I ’m not a pervert ? ”
4331	4341	4076	4076	himself	68	“ Temporarily . I ’m putting you on probation . ”
4342	4347	4348	4348	He	68	“ That ’s fair . ”
4356	4376	4348	4348	He	68	“ But I do need to ask a few rapid - fire questions , just to double - check . ”
4377	4381	4076	4076	himself	68	“ Hit me . ”
4382	4388	4076	4076	himself	68	“ Favorite singer or band ? ”
4389	4392	4348	4348	He	68	“ Blondie . ”
4393	4396	4397	4397	I	0	“ Really ? ”
4402	4405	4406	4406	He	68	“ Yup . ”
4425	4428	4419	4419	he	68	“ Obsessed . ”
4429	4440	4348	4348	He	68	“ Okay , good answer . How about favorite candy ? ”
4441	4458	4459	4459	I	0	“ Smarties because I ’m smart , and I think they make me feel extra clever . ”
4462	4475	4459	4459	I	0	“ I guess that ’s a good reason . Favorite TV show ? ”
4476	4522	4348	4348	He	68	“ Wonder Years . Hence , the Fred Savage comment earlier . Love him . Second to Wonder Years is Boy Meets World , as fuck , did I crush on Topanga so goddamn hard . And of course , Cory is my man crush . ”
4523	4530	4348	4348	He	68	“ Fan of the Savage brothers ? ”
4531	4539	4459	4459	I	0	“ They ’re my ride or die . ”
4540	4547	4548	4548	He	282	“ Makes you seem very relatable . ”
4559	4589	4556	4556	he	282	“ Stick around , Lia . You ’ll see just how relatable a finance major with a penchant to crash his model airplane every time he flies it is . ”
4590	4598	4459	4459	I	0	“ I always thought Shawn was whiny . ”
4599	4604	4605	4605	Breaker	68	“ Join the club , ”
4612	4620	4605	4605	Breaker	68	“ Thoughts on Mr. Turner ’s mullet ? ”
4621	4624	4625	4625	I	0	“ Hot , ”
4628	4658	4625	4625	I	0	“ So if I were to , let ’s say . . . grow this hair out to be a mullet , what would your thoughts be on that ? ”
4659	4667	4668	4668	He	282	“ Pitiful , get your own look . ”
4671	4687	4668	4668	He	282	“ Man , you sure know how to bring a man down to his knees . ”
4688	4698	4625	4625	I	0	“ Apparently , it ’s what I do best . ”
4699	4710	4711	4711	He	282	“ Apparently , I like that about you , though . ”
4721	4736	4713	4713	his	282	“ So , Lia , what did you think about tonight ? Have fun ? ”
4737	4745	4625	4625	I	0	“ I had a lot of fun . ”
4761	4803	4757	4757	I	0	“ It ’s been hard meeting people here , you know , people who are on the same level as me . I just recently transferred , so not coming in as a freshman and making friends has been a challenge . Although”—I
4807	4821	4757	4757	I	0	room—“I do feel comfortable here , despite these dwellings belonging to a mustache . ”
4822	4897	4757	4757	I	0	“ I ’m going to take that as a compliment . And meeting new people is hard . Took me a second to figure it all out too . They always say college is where you get to reinvent yourself and find like - minded people . Well , they do n’t tell you it does n’t happen immediately . I ’m a junior now and feel like I ’ve just hit my stride . ”
4898	4921	4806	4806	his	282	“ Same . No one seems to like spending countless hours poring over a game of Scrabble or knitting hats for cats . ”
4922	4927	4806	4806	his	282	“ Hats for cats ? ”
4928	4947	4948	4948	I	0	“ Quite fetching . I sell them to old ladies who think dressing up their cats is fun . ”
4951	4998	4948	4948	I	0	“ Started it for some side cash , but now , I ’m invested . But yeah , tonight reminded me that there are like - minded people out there for me , making me feel like myself for the first time in a long time . ”
5003	5010	5011	5011	He	284	“ I ’m glad , Lia . ”
5021	5037	5011	5011	He	284	“ I bet a lot of you feeling comfortable has to do with the mustache . ”
5038	5045	5046	5046	I	0	“ It ’s not the mustache , ”
5055	5062	5052	5052	He	284	“ Do you have a boyfriend ? ”
5075	5090	5069	5069	he	284	“ Not because I ’m getting all pervy on you , just genuinely curious . ”
5091	5162	5163	5163	His	284	“ I did until he broke up with me and told me I was lame because I started a fan fiction for Supernatural . I was into different things than he was , so it was hard to connect . Does n’t seem like I can find many people at all who understand the desire to make Sam and Dean not brothers , but rather . . . secret lovers . ”
5179	5197	5176	5176	he	284	“ Hold the fuck on . . . you ’re the author of Lovers , Not Brothers ? ”
5198	5201	5202	5202	I	0	“ Wait . ”
5207	5214	5202	5202	I	0	“ You ’ve heard of it ? ”
5215	5220	5221	5221	he	284	“ Heard of it ? ”
5241	5329	5221	5221	he	284	“ Lia , that shit is addicting . I ’m not even gay , but Jesus Christ , their first kiss was the best fucking thing I ’ve ever read . I had actual sweat forming on the back of my neck while Dean slowly rubbed his nose along Sam ’s jaw , waiting for the cue that Sam was ready . And then . . . when their mouths collided , I let out a fucking wallop of a cheer . The sexual tension was unnerving . ”
5330	5349	5397	5397	his	286	“ And you did n’t think it was weird that we know them as brothers in real life ? ”

9828	9894	9551	9551	She	168	“ Yes , they ’re putting together all the evidence they need to present their case . I do n’t think we ’re in it for the money because we do n’t need it , nor are we in the business of putting people in debt , but Huxley wants to set a precedent . Make sure that people know not to fuck with us . ”
9895	9928	9751	9751	She	168	“ Probably smart because this girl has opened the door to the possibility of lawsuits , and if you end this correctly , no one will want to go up against you . ”

9938	9990	9551	9551	She	168	“ So what ’s the problem ? Sure , maybe your ego is slightly tarnished , but when has that ever affected you before ? Remember the time in college you were mistaken for the third - best Scrabble player rather than the second ? You took that like a champ . ”

10134	10165	10124	10124	I	0	“ I did n’t mention one thing . The guys said I ca n’t go to work . I have to take time off until they figure this all out . ”
10166	10191	10063	10063	she	348	“ So what you ’re telling me is that you were just granted a vacation , and you ’re complaining about that , why ? ”
10192	10239	10124	10124	I	0	“ Because people will think I ’m in trouble or did something wrong when I did n’t do anything wrong . I ’ve worked hard to maintain genuine relationships with my employees , and if I ’m not there , what will they think of me ? ”
10240	10250	10251	10251	she	350	“ I can see why that would bother you , ”
10254	10277	10251	10251	she	350	“ You do tend to pride yourself on the way you treat people , and this is a slur to your character . ”
10278	10286	10287	10287	I	0	“ Exactly . It ’s really shitty , ”
10295	10298	10299	10299	Lia	168	“ Hey , ”
10306	10368	10299	10299	Lia	168	“ The people who know you will understand the circumstances . They know you ’re not some tyrant , running up and down the hallway like a lunatic , yelling at the first person you run into . And the other people , the ones who might believe Gemma , well , they ’re not people you want around you anyway . ”
10369	10376	10377	10377	I	0	“ I know you ’re right , ”
10381	10395	10377	10377	I	0	“ Just ca n’t seem to wrap my head around all of it . ”
10411	10438	10396	10396	She	168	“ It will be okay . If anything , Huxley is relentless , and he wo n’t rest until your name is expunged of any wrongdoing . ”
10439	10444	10445	10445	She	168	“ I guess so . ”
10457	10474	10450	10450	I	0	“ I ’m sorry about all of this . I ’m totally bringing down the night . ”
10475	10515	10396	10396	She	168	“ It ’s okay . How about we put glass Yahtzee on hold for now in case you have intermittent episodes of rage . We ca n’t risk the slivers . Want to play cards out on the balcony ? ”
10516	10540	10445	10445	She	168	“ Maybe we can watch a show . There ’s a new documentary called The King of Kong that I want to watch . ”
10541	10561	10562	10562	Lia	168	“ Oh , I saw that the other day when I was scrolling through what to watch with Brian , ”
10570	10592	10562	10562	Lia	168	“ I suggested it , and he gave me the side - eye . We ended up watching some sports game . ”
10593	10598	10599	10599	I	0	“ Some sports game ? ”
10602	10609	10599	10599	I	0	“ Not even sure what sport ? ”
10610	10616	10562	10562	Lia	168	“ A ball was involved . ”
10617	10625	10626	10626	She	168	“ Well , that narrows it down . ”
10629	10654	10626	10626	She	168	“ Either way , I ’d love to watch it . Shall we start it now ? Bring our food over to the couch . ”
10655	10663	10664	10664	She	168	“ If you ’re cool with that . ”
10678	10684	10664	10664	She	168	“ Anything for my pickle . ”
10688	10696	10664	10664	She	168	“ Brian would have hated that documentary . ”
10713	10726	10727	10727	Lia	168	“ Yeah , did n’t quite scream something Brian would have enjoyed . ”
10735	10754	10727	10727	Lia	168	“ You going to be okay ? You ’re usually a little more chatty when we watch documentaries . ”
10755	10770	10727	10727	Lia	168	“ Yeah , I was just thinking . I ’ll be good , though . ”
10771	10788	10727	10727	Lia	168	“ You know , if you need to talk about it , I ’m always here . ”
10789	10793	10794	10794	I	0	“ I know . ”
10801	10806	10794	10794	I	0	“ Thanks , Lia . ”
10813	10833	10834	10834	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . Now get out of here and go to bed . You look like trash . ”
10837	10848	10834	10834	I	0	“ Can always count on you to deliver the truth . ”
10867	10872	10849	10849	I	0	“ Night , Lia . ”
10873	10878	10879	10879	I	0	“ Night , Pickle . ”
11346	11349	11350	11350	Brian	100	“ Morning , ”
11356	11372	11350	11350	Brian	100	“ Just wanted to remind you that we have lunch with my mom this afternoon . ”
11382	11413	11373	11373	I	0	“ Yup , do n’t worry , I ’ll be there fifteen minutes early so she does n’t have to comment on how I ’m there only five minutes early . ”
11414	11418	11419	11419	he	370	“ Be nice , ”
11422	11431	11419	11419	he	370	“ I ’m . . . I ’m — ”
11432	11443	11444	11444	I	0	“ So did you tell him about us last night ? ”
11473	11486	11464	11464	Brian	100	“ Not yet . It was n’t a good time last night . ”
11487	11507	11419	11419	he	370	“ Lia , how could it not be a good time to tell your best friend you ’re engaged ? ”
11508	11550	11464	11464	Brian	100	“ He has some really bad things happening at work right now . Like . . . inimical circumstances . He found out about it last night . I did n’t think it was appropriate to just spring it on him . ”
11551	11557	11464	11464	Brian	100	“ What ’s going on ? ”
11558	11562	11563	11563	I	0	“ Confidential things , ”
11588	11597	11602	11602	He	68	“ Anyway , I ’ll tell him soon . ”
11598	11601	11602	11602	He	68	“ Okay . ”
11608	11622	11602	11602	He	68	“ You ’re not avoiding telling him for a reason , are you ? ”
11623	11629	11630	11630	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
11676	11709	11668	11668	I	0	“ It means I just want to make sure you ’re happy about being engaged . It ’s been a week , Lia , and you have n’t said anything to him . ”
11710	11740	11755	11755	he	377	“ Because he ’s been out of town . I ’m not about to tell him over the phone . It ’s something I want to do in person . ”
11741	11746	11747	11747	he	377	“ Okay . . . ”
11760	11805	11755	11755	he	377	“ Brian , I ’m going to tell him . I just want it to be a celebration , not something I say in passing or when he ’s in a bad mood or out of town . He ’ll be happy for us . ”
11806	11811	11755	11755	he	377	“ Are you sure ? ”
11812	11818	11755	11755	he	377	“ Why would n’t he ? ”
11819	11834	11755	11755	he	377	“ I do n’t know . You ’ve just been weird since I proposed . ”
11835	11840	11841	11841	I	0	“ Weird , how ? ”
11861	11930	11844	11844	I	0	“ Well , for one , we ’ve only seen each other twice this past week , and I do n’t know , I would think that since we ’ve been engaged , we ’d see each other more . And your texting has been sporadic . That ’s why I called this morning because I wanted to make sure you were going to show up for lunch . ”
11931	11941	11755	11755	he	377	“ Brian , of course I ’d show up . ”
11942	11963	11844	11844	I	0	“ I just do n’t know , Lia . Seems like you do n’t want to be engaged to me . ”
11964	11967	11968	11968	I	0	“ Stop , ”
11974	11997	11968	11968	I	0	“ This is all just so . . . new , okay ? I ’m taking it one day at a time . ”
12018	12105	12001	12001	I	0	“ I may not talk about them as much anymore , but I miss my parents , Brian . They were my world . They should be here with me celebrating . Planning . Being goofy and happy with . . . for me . But . . . they ’re not here anymore , and that ’s just so hard . So if I ’m acting strange , it ’s because I ’m feeling . . . I do n’t know . . . sad . ”
12106	12109	12110	12110	He	378	“ Oh . ”
12115	12154	12110	12110	He	378	“ I ’m sorry , Lia . I did n’t think about it that way . I just assumed , you know , since you ’re so close with Breaker , that maybe something was going on there . ”
12155	12158	12159	12159	I	0	“ Brian , ”
12169	12230	12159	12159	I	0	“ I ’ve told you time and time again , nothing is going on with Breaker and me . Please , please do n’t make this a thing . I do n’t want to have to keep saying this to you over and over . You should know me well enough that when I say something , I mean it . ”
12231	12243	12244	12244	He	379	“ I know , sorry . Fuck , Lia . . . ”
12251	12264	12244	12244	He	379	“ It ’s just been a weird week . I ’m sorry . ”
12265	12286	12159	12159	I	0	“ It ’s okay . But hey , I should open my computer and get some work done before lunch . ”
12287	12300	12244	12244	He	379	“ Okay . I love you . I ’ll see you later . ”
12301	12307	12308	12308	I	0	“ Love you , too , ”
13401	13406	13407	13407	Brian	100	“ Lia , wow , ”
13416	13421	13410	13410	he	400	“ You look stunning . ”
13659	13665	13666	13666	I	0	“ You look really good , ”
13686	13690	13666	13666	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
13700	13711	13697	13697	he	400	“ You ready for this ? Mother is very excited . ”
13848	13852	13853	13853	He	400	“ Very ready . ”

14134	14145	14131	14131	Brian	100	“ She always likes to be the first to arrive . ”
14176	14181	14182	14183	the host	426	“ Right this way , ”
14321	14328	14311	14311	Brian	100	“ Mother , you look beautiful . ”
14329	14333	14334	14334	she	428	“ Thank you , ”
14406	14420	14388	14388	I	0	“ Hello , Mrs. Beaver . It ’s so nice seeing you today . ”
14482	14504	14479	14479	she	428	“ Ophelia , it ’s nice to see you . Please take a seat . We have much to talk about . ”

14582	14594	14572	14573	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ Brian , dear , did you get insurance on this ? ”
14595	14607	14608	14609	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ Yes , Mother . As well as a monthly cleaning . ”
14614	14617	14608	14609	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ Good . ”
14632	14646	14620	14620	she	108	“ I took the liberty of ordering all of us the salmon salad . ”
14666	14695	14663	14663	she	108	“ I did n’t want to waste any time looking over a menu . We have a lot to talk about , a lot of planning to do . ”
14696	14699	14700	14700	I	0	“ Planning ? ”
14705	14727	14700	14700	I	0	“ Yes , Ophelia . You ’re an engaged woman now . That means we need to start planning the wedding . ”
14728	14734	14735	14735	Her	108	“ Oh , so soon ? ”
14743	14785	14735	14735	Her	108	“ What do you mean , so soon ? Ophelia , we only have one month until the end of summer . The club has a spot open on a Saturday night in five weeks , so yes , so soon . ”
14786	14799	14800	14800	I	0	“ Wait , you want us to get married in five weeks ? ”
14819	14828	14809	14809	Brian	100	“ Mother , that does seem rather quick . ”
14848	14893	14837	14837	her	108	“ Brian , do you expect to wait a whole year ? The Beavers only get married in the summer . You know this , it ’s tradition , and since you proposed late , we only have about five weeks to work with . ”
14894	14903	14904	14904	I	0	“ What ’s wrong with waiting a year ? ”
14909	14922	14904	14904	I	0	“ That will give us time to make sure everything is perfect . ”
14923	14951	14837	14837	her	108	“ Brian ’s niece will be far too tall to be the flower girl a year from now . You must think about the pictures , Ophelia . ”
14971	14991	14992	14992	She	108	“ The wedding must be this year and must be in five weeks . That ’s our only option . ”
15010	15026	15027	15027	Brian	100	“ Five weeks , well . . . I guess we can make it work , ”
15037	15047	15027	15027	Brian	100	“ It will be fun , right , Ophelia ? ”
15138	15143	15144	15144	I	0	“ Uh , sorry . ”
15150	15176	15144	15144	I	0	“ This whole wedding thing is just hard , you know ? I thought I ’d be doing this with my parents by my side . ”
15177	15182	15187	15187	she	108	“ Oh , dear , ”
15193	15204	15205	15205	She	108	“ That ’s what you have me for . Now . ”
15248	15256	15257	15257	she	108	“ This will be your planning book , ”
15265	15311	15257	15257	she	108	“ It has everything in it that needs to be chosen . Of course , given that your parents are no longer with us , I ’ve taken it upon myself to give you a few options for the type of weddings to choose from . ”
15323	15345	15312	15312	She	108	“ The venue is obviously the club . Our family has had receptions here for years . That will not change . ”
15356	15375	15312	15312	She	108	“ As for the flowers , colors , and theme , there ’s some leeway in those decisions . ”
15376	15379	15380	15380	I	0	“ Leeway ? ”
15424	15449	15414	15414	I	0	“ Yes , well , we do have some very powerful people attending . We need to keep up appearances for that reason alone . ”
15450	15460	15461	15461	I	0	“ But what about what Brian and I want ? ”
15464	15473	15461	15461	I	0	“ This is our wedding , after all . ”
15506	15596	15481	15481	she	108	“ Ophelia , you must understand the importance of marrying into the Beaver family . This is n’t some ordinary wedding ; this is a show of status . This is a way for our family to exhibit the many accomplishments we ’ve made to gain the status we have . Every intricate detail will be chosen based on obtaining our place in our circle . I understand you come from humble beginnings , but you will be a Beaver soon , and certain expectations are to be upheld . ”
15604	15626	15601	15601	Brian	100	“ It ’s just a party , Ophelia . What does it really matter what kind of flowers are picked out ? ”
15627	15633	15634	15634	I	0	“ It matters to me , ”
15655	15660	15661	15662	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ Now , now . ”
15668	15676	15677	15677	She	108	“ No need to cause a scene . ”
15683	15735	15677	15677	She	108	“ I can see you have some thoughts about the wedding , and I do n’t want to steamroll your special day . How about this . . . we take it one decision at a time ? We can meet , explore options , and you can choose from there . ”
15736	15746	15747	15747	Brian	100	“ That ’s really kind of you , Mother , ”
15767	15779	15780	15781	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ Well , if anything , I ’m an understanding woman , ”
15784	15819	15780	15781	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ I do n’t want your bride to be upset with her new family . So what do you say , Ophelia ? Think you can manage meetings with me ? Make some decisions ? ”
15887	15890	15891	15891	I	0	“ Yes , ”
15894	15902	15891	15891	I	0	“ I think that would be nice . ”
15903	15906	15907	15908	Mrs. Beaver	108	“ Wonderful , ”
15934	15941	15942	15942	She	108	“ Now , let ’s eat . ”
15973	15980	15981	15981	Brian	100	“ Thank you again , Lia , ”
16234	16240	16241	16241	I	0	“ Thank you for what ? ”
16254	16278	16241	16241	I	0	“ I know the big wedding thing is n’t what you were probably looking for , but it ’s important to my mother . ”
16279	16286	16287	16287	I	0	“ Yeah , I could tell . ”
16305	16332	16302	16302	I	0	“ Are you sure this is all necessary ? Do we really have to have such a grandiose wedding ? Maybe we can elope or something ? ”
16336	16371	16333	16333	He	467	“ Lia , my mother would absolutely kill me . I ’m her baby boy , the last one to get married out of her children . She will not allow me to elope . ”
16372	16378	16379	16379	I	0	“ You know , Brian , ”
16393	16410	16379	16379	I	0	“ The great thing about being an adult is that you can make your own decisions . ”
16426	16451	16411	16411	He	467	“ Yes , but when the decision does n’t really bother me , I ’m not going to put up a fight about it . ”
16452	16459	16460	16460	I	0	“ But do n’t I matter ? ”
16468	16490	16463	16463	He	467	“ Of course you matter , Lia . But I also know that wedding stuff is n’t that important to you . ”
16491	16506	16507	16507	He	467	“ It should be important to us both , as it ’s our day . ”
16525	16583	16509	16509	his	467	“ We have the rest of our lives to do things the way we want . This is one day , Lia . And it ’s going to be beautiful , you know my mother would n’t have it any other way . Trust her , okay ? You might feel that what she thinks is perfect . ”
16632	16653	16629	16629	I	0	“ Breaker just got here . I ’m telling him tonight about the engagement . Please do n’t say anything . ”
16672	16675	16676	16676	he	468	“ Tonight ? ”
16679	16698	16676	16676	he	468	“ But I thought we could go into your place , and you know . . . celebrate . ”

16759	16761	16764	16764	he	468	“ celebrate ”
16770	16809	16810	16810	He	468	“ I ’m sorry , but I promised we could hang out tonight . I ’ll make it up to you . I ’ll bring an overnight bag Friday and spend the whole weekend with you . Okay ? ”
16819	16829	16810	16810	He	468	“ Brian , please , do n’t be mad . ”
16830	16837	16838	16838	He	468	“ No , I get it . ”
16843	16851	16838	16838	He	468	“ But you ’re mine this weekend . ”
16852	16855	16856	16856	I	0	“ Promise , ”
16930	16943	16923	16923	Brian	100	“ Good to see you , man . How was New York ? ”
16944	16947	16948	16948	Breaker	68	“ Good , ”
17022	17034	17016	17016	Brian	100	“ Glad to be back . I prefer the West Coast . ”
17035	17078	16995	16995	He	68	“ I do n’t know . There ’s something the city has to offer that you just do n’t get here . Who knows , maybe we ’ll make our way over to the Big Apple one day , right , Lia ? ”
17120	17132	17117	17117	I	0	“ Well , I ’ll see you this weekend , okay ? ”
17142	17158	17133	17133	Brian	100	“ Call me tonight . I want to talk about this weekend and our plans . ”
17159	17162	17117	17117	I	0	“ Okay . ”
17163	17167	17117	17117	I	0	“ Love you . ”
17168	17172	17173	17173	I	0	“ Love you . ”
17217	17225	17226	17226	he	68	“ Are you moving to New York ? ”
17229	17232	17226	17226	he	68	“ What ? ”
17237	17240	17233	17233	I	0	“ No ! ”
17246	17259	17233	17233	I	0	“ No . I do n’t know what he was talking about . ”
17260	17275	17241	17241	I	0	“ Are you sure ? Because you ’re looking sort of fidgety right now . ”
17292	17311	17312	17312	I	0	“ I ’m sure . I think that was just some offhand comment . We ’re not moving . ”
17328	17359	17312	17312	I	0	“ Okay , because that would not settle well with me . I mean , I would make the move , but I like it here on the West Coast . ”
17360	17365	17366	17366	He	481	“ I do too . ”
17390	17399	17366	17366	He	481	“ You look nice , by the way . ”
17417	17427	17408	17408	I	0	“ The dress is not me . Too short . ”
17428	17446	17447	17447	I	0	“ It might not be you , but it still looks good . What was the occasion ? ”
17458	17466	17447	17447	I	0	“ Uh , lunch with The Beave . ”
17549	17558	17559	17559	Breaker	68	“ Ah . . . at the club ? ”
17685	17692	17753	17753	I	0	“ Yes , at the club . ”
17693	17700	17649	17649	He	260	“ Get the salmon salad again ? ”
17701	17727	17728	17728	He	260	“ Yes , and it was as dreadful as the first , second , third , fourth , and fifth time I ’ve had it . ”
17732	17752	17728	17728	He	260	“ Next time , excuse yourself after you order and tell the waitstaff to bring you a burger instead . ”
17760	17782	17728	17728	He	260	“ And risk the waitstaff being snapped at ? No , thank you . I ’d rather suffer through the salmon . ”
17783	17796	17649	17649	He	260	“ You ’re a real Joan of Arc , you know that ? ”
17797	17824	17649	17649	He	260	“ I try . Okay , I ’m going to change real quick because I ca n’t sit comfortably in this without flashing you my underwear . ”
17825	17837	17649	17649	He	260	“ Not that I have n’t been flashed countless times before . ”
17838	17851	17649	17649	He	260	“ By accident ! You make me sound like a philandering woman . ”
17852	17885	17649	17649	He	260	“ Halloween , five years ago , you wore that maid outfit . I think I saw your underwear more times that night than all the years we ’ve known each other . ”
17886	17944	17649	17649	He	260	“ Uh , excuse me , sir . I wore that maid outfit because I lost a bet to you , and that ’s what you chose . If it was my choice , I would have gone as a piece of toast with melted butter . You know how much I love dressing up as food . ”
17945	17956	17649	17649	He	260	“ Yeah , but the maid costume was more fun . ”
17957	17966	17967	17967	He	495	“ For you . . . you pervert . ”
17973	17998	17969	17969	his	495	“ For the last time , it was n’t because I was being pervy . It was because I knew you would hate it . ”
17999	18010	18011	18011	He	495	“ Wow , you ’re such a great best friend . ”
18015	18019	18011	18011	He	495	“ I know . ”
18298	18306	18403	18403	he	68	“ Ugh , they smell so good . ”
18307	18326	18327	18327	I	0	“ Yeah , they do , so hurry your ass on over here so I can dig in . ”
18335	18343	18327	18327	I	0	“ You could have started without me . ”
18344	18363	18403	18403	he	68	“ You know I never do . If anything , I ’m a gentleman and will always wait . ”
18364	18378	18403	18403	he	68	“ You did n’t wait two months ago when I brought over cheesecake . ”
18379	18384	18327	18327	I	0	“ Ah , cheesecake . ”
18385	18395	18396	18396	I	0	“ Very true . All sweets are your downfall . ”
18419	18421	18327	18327	I	0	“ clink ”
18454	18460	18451	18451	he	68	“ So how was lunch ? ”
18466	18478	18479	18479	He	68	“ Oh , you know , same old , same old . ”
18497	18510	18479	18479	He	68	“ Why do I feel like you ’re hiding something from me ? ”
18511	18526	18527	18527	I	0	“ What ? Hiding ? Ha ! No , I do n’t hide things . ”
18538	18556	18527	18527	I	0	“ Why would I hide something from you ? That seems pointless . I tell you everything . ”
18557	18562	18479	18479	He	68	“ You ’re babbling . ”
18563	18586	18587	18587	He	68	“ Uh , no , I ’m not . I ’m defending myself . Because why would I hide something from you ? ”
18596	18603	18587	18587	He	68	“ You ’re definitely hiding something . ”
18604	18613	18479	18479	He	68	“ I do n’t like your accusatory glare . ”
18614	18635	18636	18636	He	68	“ And I do n’t like that you ’re prolonging the inevitable of actually telling me what ’s going on . ”
18641	18647	18636	18636	He	68	“ Go ahead , spill . ”
18682	18690	18670	18670	I	0	“ Something has developed in my life . ”
18691	18696	18697	18697	he	68	“ Oh - kay , ”
18701	18710	18697	18697	he	68	“ Something that will change things a bit . ”
18715	18727	18697	18697	he	68	“ You are moving to New York , are n’t you ? ”
18728	18747	18748	18748	His	68	“ Noooooo ! I ’m not moving , I ’m just . . . changing my relationship status . ”
18752	18762	18748	18748	His	68	“ You ’re breaking up with Brian ? Thank — ”
18763	18775	18697	18697	he	68	“ No , he proposed , and we ’re getting married . ”
18786	18789	18783	18783	he	68	“ Married ? ”
18790	18795	18796	18796	I	0	“ In five weeks . ”
18799	18803	18804	18804	he	68	“ Five weeks ? ”
18807	18816	18804	18804	he	68	“ Like in . . . five weeks ? ”
18817	18820	18821	18821	He	68	“ Yes . ”
18841	18898	18836	18836	I	0	“ I know it ’s coming on quick , but The Beave wants us to get married at the club , and there ’s an opening , and his family always gets married in the summer , and next year wo n’t work because his niece will be too tall . So yeah , five weeks . ”
18899	18902	18903	18903	He	68	“ Wow . ”
18917	18934	18903	18903	He	68	“ That ’s . . . a lot of information . Did he just propose today ? ”
18942	18956	18935	18935	His	68	“ Where ’s the ring ? He got you a ring , right ? ”
18957	18966	18836	18836	I	0	“ Yeah , it ’s in my bedroom . ”
18967	18970	18935	18935	His	68	“ Why ? ”
18971	18999	19000	19000	I	0	“ I did n’t want to shock you , and he proposed a week ago . I wanted to tell you in person . Are you mad ? ”
19012	19019	19000	19000	I	0	“ Why would I be mad ? ”
19020	19051	18935	18935	His	68	“ Because , you know , it happened a week ago , and I have n’t told you , and I know that Brian is n’t really your favorite person . ”
19052	19068	19069	19069	Breaker	68	“ But he ’s your favorite person , so , therefore , I like him , ”
19105	19111	19091	19091	He	68	“ Show me the ring . ”
19112	19119	19120	19120	I	0	“ You want to see it ? ”
19184	19192	19168	19168	he	68	“ Yeah , show me your ring . ”
19193	19196	19197	19197	I	0	“ Okay . ”
19236	19243	19244	19244	he	68	“ Wow , that ’s nice , ”
19262	19267	19268	19268	He	68	“ Put it on . ”
19283	19292	19293	19293	he	68	“ It looks great on you , Lia , ”
19334	19346	19347	19347	I	0	“ It ’s different than what I would have picked out , ”
19350	19359	19360	19360	He	68	“ Does n’t make it any less beautiful . ”
19365	19369	19360	19360	He	68	“ Come here . ”
19439	19448	19449	19449	He	68	“ I ’m happy for you , Lia . ”
19457	19472	19449	19449	He	68	“ Five weeks is quick , but I ’m sure it will be great . ”
19573	19576	19577	19577	he	68	“ Hey , ”
19581	19587	19577	19577	he	68	“ Why are you crying ? ”
19588	19605	19577	19577	he	68	“ I . . . I think it ’s all too much for me right now . ”
19606	19610	19611	19611	he	68	“ Come here , ”
19635	19653	19611	19611	he	68	“ Talk to me . What ’s going on ? Do you not want to get married ? ”
19654	19796	19577	19577	he	68	“ No , I mean . . . I do . I just , I was n’t expecting it . Brian and I had n’t ever talked about marriage , so I was caught off guard when he proposed . Then at lunch today , it felt like everything was moving at warp speed . The Beave wants me to wear at least three dresses , which I think is a waste of money . Brian wo n’t stand up to his mom , and the ring is just . . . wow , it ’s big , and I always sort of wanted one of those past , present , and future rings with the three diamonds , and then there ’s you . I was so afraid of telling you because I know Brian is not your favorite person — ”
19797	19805	19806	19806	Breaker	68	“ Let me stop you right there , ”
19813	19857	19806	19806	Breaker	68	“ You do n’t need to worry about me or how I feel in any of this , okay ? My feelings , my thoughts , my opinions do n’t matter . All that matters is how you feel and what you want . ”
19863	19870	19858	19858	He	68	“ So how do you feel ? ”
19871	19874	19875	19875	I	0	“ Scared , ”
19878	19950	19875	19875	I	0	“ Sad . Not . . . right . And it ’s not because I do n’t love Brian , because I do , but I just think this is all weird . I used to talk about this day with my parents , and they wo n’t be there . Things are happening fast , I do n’t know . I expected to feel different when I was proposed to . ”
19951	19960	19961	19961	he	68	“ Maybe it has n’t sunk in yet , ”
19964	19978	19961	19961	he	68	“ It might just take you a moment to comprehend what ’s happening . ”
19979	19982	19983	19983	I	0	“ Maybe . ”
19996	20002	19983	19983	I	0	“ You ’re not mad ? ”
20003	20006	20007	20007	He	68	“ Lia . ”
20025	20048	20007	20007	He	68	“ If I were mad at you , then I would n’t be a very good friend , now , would I ? ”
20049	20054	19983	19983	I	0	“ I guess not . ”
20055	20077	20007	20007	He	68	“ This is exciting , okay ? Brian proposed , and you ’re getting married . Let me see a smile . ”
20093	20101	20090	20090	He	68	“ Well , that ’s just sad . ”
20102	20186	19983	19983	I	0	“ I ’m trying . I think I was doing okay about the news , just waiting to tell you , but at lunch today , I felt like I was getting steamrolled left and right by The Beave . I know the wedding is important to their family because of their social status , and it ’s all about keeping up with appearances when it comes to them , but I should have a say in all this , should n’t I ? ”
20187	20210	19983	19983	I	0	“ Uh , yes , Lia . This is your wedding . You should have a say in what happens at it . ”
20211	20234	20090	20090	He	68	“ I just become a doormat when she ’s around . It ’s hard to get my opinion in , you know ? ”
20235	20257	19983	19983	I	0	“ It ’s hard to overcome strong personalities , and I get that . I deal with my brothers every day . ”
20258	20318	19983	19983	I	0	“ And I was already steamrolled about the date , and where the reception will be held , I attempted to challenge the decision but fell short . I think I ’m going to just end up resenting this whole thing because I ’m going to be pushed around , and that ’s taking the excitement out of it . ”
20319	20333	20334	20334	I	0	“ That ’s understandable . Can you make the decisions without The Beave ? ”
20340	20352	20334	20334	I	0	“ That would never happen . She already has appointments made . ”
20353	20364	20365	20365	Breaker	68	“ Well then . . . take me with you , ”
20374	20383	20365	20365	Breaker	68	“ Come on , Breaker , be serious . ”
20384	20390	20391	20391	he	509	“ I ’m being serious , ”
20394	20433	20391	20391	he	509	“ I can go with you . It ’s not like I have anything going on right now . I have to stay away from work . This might give me something to do to keep me busy . ”
20437	20446	20434	20434	He	509	“ Maybe I can be your wedding planner . ”
20447	20454	20455	20455	I	0	“ Oh my God , stop . ”
20460	20485	20455	20455	I	0	“ Or your maid of honor . . . ooo , your man of honor . Or , better yet , man in waiting . ”
20486	20493	20494	20494	His	509	“ Can you stop being ridiculous ? ”
20499	20523	20494	20494	His	509	“ Uh , do you have another best friend I do n’t know about that would take the title of maid of honor ? ”
20532	20550	20524	20524	I	0	“ Uh , not really , no . But I guess I never really thought about it . ”
20551	20560	20455	20455	I	0	“ I ’m your best friend , correct ? ”
20561	20565	20566	20566	I	0	“ You are , ”
20569	20587	20566	20566	I	0	“ And best friends always claim the title as best man or maid of honor , correct ? ”
20588	20591	20455	20455	I	0	“ Yessss , ”
20596	20629	20592	20592	I	0	“ Therefore , by process of elimination , I ’m your man of honor , but I believe man in waiting has a better ring to it , do n’t you think ? ”
20630	20640	20455	20455	I	0	“ You ’re not being serious , are you ? ”
20641	20647	20648	20648	he	510	“ Of course I am , ”
20654	20727	20648	20648	he	510	“ Listen , Lia . I know this is going to be tough without your parents . Losing them was so hard , and they would n’t want you to do this alone . I have the time , and even if I did n’t , I would make the time for you . I can help . I can be your backup , your wingman , your bodyguard , your bruiser . ”
20728	20742	20455	20455	I	0	“ Bodyguard ? Do you really think I need protection from The Beave ? ”
20743	20776	20799	20799	Breaker	68	“ I ’ve met her before . Her stare alone is terrifying , let alone the manipulation . Trust me , you will need a bodyguard , and I ’m your man . ”
20777	20783	20648	20648	he	510	“ But what about Brian ? ”
20784	20789	20455	20455	I	0	“ What about him ? ”
20790	20798	20799	20799	Breaker	68	“ You guys do n’t get along . ”
20811	20855	20799	20799	Breaker	68	“ Well , he ’s going to be your husband . Better late than never to build on that relationship because I wo n’t let any hard feelings or awkward tension with your future husband get between you and me , got it ? ”
20878	20884	20885	20885	he	68	“ What ’s going on ? ”
20890	20895	20885	20885	he	68	“ Just . . . ”
20903	20936	20896	20896	I	0	“ I ’m so glad I told you . You looked like a pervert with your mustache so many years ago , but I ’m lucky to have you in my life . ”
20943	20962	20937	20937	He	68	“ You know , if you ’re lucky , I could bring back the mustache for your wedding . ”
20969	20977	20963	20963	I	0	“ Do n’t even think about it . ”
21597	21602	21581	21581	I	0	“ I brought breakfast . ”
21603	21606	21607	21607	He	92	“ Dude . ”
21612	21630	21607	21607	He	92	“ Just because you ca n’t go to work does n’t mean you need to bother me . ”
21631	21645	21581	21581	I	0	“ This is n’t about work . I need to talk to you . ”
21646	21663	21696	21696	He	92	“ Is it about the psycho who made you a pair of boxers from tweed fabric ? ”
21664	21677	21607	21607	He	92	“ It was burlap , and no . This is about Lia . ”
21678	21681	21682	21682	he	92	“ Lia ? ”
21714	21725	21696	21696	He	92	“ Oh shit , you finally realized you love her . ”
21731	21746	21747	21747	I	0	“ I ’m going to fucking kick you in the dick with that shit , ”
21765	21781	21757	21757	JP	92	“ It has nothing to do with my platonic feelings toward her . Got it ? ”
21782	21785	21786	21786	He	92	“ Sure . ”
21796	21812	21786	21786	He	92	“ I hope there ’s a cronut in there . I ’ve been craving one . ”
21813	21817	21818	21818	I	0	“ There is , ”
21821	21838	21818	21818	I	0	“ But you ’re not going to get it if you ’re a dick to me . ”
21839	21859	21786	21786	He	92	“ Dude , you ’re the one at my house . I can treat you however I fucking want . ”
21882	21887	21867	21867	Kelsey	113	“ Who is it ? ”
21888	21891	21892	21892	JP	92	“ Breaker , ”
21895	21903	21892	21892	JP	92	“ He needs to talk about Lia . ”

21952	21985	21948	21948	Her	113	“ Oh , okay . Let me put my hair up , and I ’ll be right down . Want me to call Lottie over so you have another girl ’s opinion ? ”
22028	22037	22013	22013	Huxley	92	“ Sure , tell her I brought donuts . ”
22038	22051	22052	22052	Kelsey	113	“ She ’ll be over here in minutes , I ’m sure . ”
22076	22096	22068	22068	JP	92	“ You know , it does n’t shock me that you came to my house rather than Huxley ’s . ”
22097	22129	22013	22013	Huxley	92	“ After walking in on Huxley and Lottie fucking against a wall , I learned my lesson . Ca n’t get the vision of his clenched ass out of my head . ”
22130	22138	22013	22013	Huxley	92	“ Kelsey and I fuck against walls . ”
22139	22186	22068	22068	JP	92	“ I ’m well aware . The only difference is if I walk in on you and Kelsey , you ’ll just laugh about it . Huxley gives me the silent treatment for a week and then a lecture about privacy between a husband and wife . ”
22187	22198	22199	22199	JP	92	“ He still is rather uptight , is n’t he ? ”
22202	22229	22199	22199	JP	92	“ You would think after marrying Lottie , he might loosen up a touch , but he really ca n’t seem to let the stick out . ”
22230	22242	22243	22243	JP	92	“ At this point , the stick is a permanent resident . ”
22281	22288	22289	22289	I	0	“ Want me to grab plates ? ”
22292	22305	22289	22289	I	0	“ Yeah , it would be nice if you made yourself useful . ”
22306	22314	22315	22315	I	0	“ Just a simple yes would suffice , ”
22354	22389	22344	22344	she	113	“ Lottie will be over in a second . I said donuts , and she ran . Not sure about Huxley , I heard him groan in displeasure when Lottie hopped out of bed . ”
22532	22540	22527	22527	Lottie	96	“ Donuts , get in my mouth ! ”
22581	22593	22594	22594	Huxley	92	“ Why the hell are we gathering so early this morning ? ”
22610	22639	22597	22597	he	92	“ Is this about the job ? I ’m not getting into it with you . You ca n’t be around while the team conducts a thorough investigation . ”
22640	22648	22649	22649	I	0	“ It ’s not about the job , ”
22652	22658	22649	22649	I	0	“ It ’s about Lia , ”
22683	22694	22666	22666	I	0	“ I did n’t say anything about you liking her . ”
22695	22700	22666	22666	I	0	“ No cooing either . ”
22701	22707	22666	22666	I	0	“ Christ , sensitive much ? ”
22708	22716	22720	22720	her	96	“ What ’s going on with Lia ? ”
22728	22747	22717	22717	Lottie	96	“ Well , since you ’re all here , might as well tell you that Lia is engaged . ”
22748	22753	22754	22754	Kelsey	113	“ Aw , really ? ”
22759	22768	22769	22769	Lottie	96	“ Engaged ? Wow , that ’s great , ”
22772	22776	22777	22777	JP	92	“ To Brian ? ”
22780	22784	22785	22785	Huxley	92	“ The douche ? ”
22788	22797	22798	22798	Kelsey	113	“ Wait , why is he a douche ? ”
22801	22808	22798	22798	Kelsey	113	“ Do we not like him ? ”
22809	22817	22818	22818	Lottie	96	“ The boys do n’t like anyone , ”
22825	22834	22835	22835	JP	92	“ No , we do n’t like him , ”
22843	22851	22835	22835	JP	92	“ How do you feel about it ? ”
22852	22856	22857	22857	I	0	“ Not great , ”
22894	22975	22874	22874	JP	92	“ He does n’t deserve her . He ’s not good enough . And you should have seen the ring he got her . It does n’t have one ounce of Lia in it . It ’s as if he went to the most expensive and gaudy ring shop , said ‘ give me the most expensive ring you have ’ , and then bought it . And worst of all , The Beave wants the wedding in five weeks . ”
22976	22980	22981	22981	JP	92	“ Five weeks ? ”
22984	22998	22999	22999	He	92	“ Jesus , that ’s quick , although our wedding was quick too . ”
23004	23014	22999	22999	He	92	“ But that was to accommodate Kazoo ’s schedule . ”
23015	23032	23033	23033	JP	92	“ Yes , planning a wedding around a pigeon has always been a dream of mine . ”
23044	23052	23033	23033	JP	92	“ You loved everything about our wedding . ”
23053	23057	23033	23033	JP	92	“ I did . ”
23068	23081	23065	23065	I	0	“ And last night , when she told me , she cried . ”
23082	23086	23087	23087	Lottie	96	“ Happy tears ? ”
23095	23133	23090	23090	I	0	“ No , sad tears , nervous tears , unhappy tears . There was n’t excitement in her voice , and she kept asking me if I was mad . Why the hell would I be mad ? ”
23145	23148	23149	23149	I	0	“ What ? ”
23180	23211	23172	23172	JP	92	“ Dude , do n’t you think that a little part of Lia thinks maybe , just maybe , you would have made a move on her at one point ? ”
23212	23215	23216	23216	I	0	“ What ? ”
23221	23243	23216	23216	I	0	“ No . We ’ve never thought of each other that way . This has nothing to do with our relationship . ”
23244	23254	23255	23255	Lottie	96	“ Does she know you do n’t like Brian ? ”
23258	23279	23255	23255	Lottie	96	“ I ’ve never said I do n’t like him , but she ’s aware we do n’t get along . ”
23280	23293	23294	23294	Kelsey	113	“ Maybe that ’s why she ’s asking if you ’re mad , ”
23297	23312	23294	23294	Kelsey	113	“ You two are so close that maybe she ’s looking for your approval . ”
23313	23346	23358	23358	his	92	“ But I do n’t approve of him . That ’s the problem . He ’s not right for her , and I do n’t know what I should do about it . ”
23347	23350	23351	23351	Huxley	92	“ Nothing , ”
23362	23385	23358	23358	his	92	“ Absolutely nothing . If you get between her and Brian , you ’re just going to ruin your relationship with her . ”
23386	23398	23358	23358	his	92	“ So what , I just let her marry the douche ? ”
23399	23402	23403	23403	Huxley	92	“ Yes , ”
23413	23416	23406	23406	I	0	“ But — ”
23417	23423	23424	23424	Huxley	92	“ There is no but , ”
23427	23451	23424	23424	Huxley	92	“ She has lost enough in her life . The last thing she needs is for you to make things complicated for her . ”
23452	23475	23406	23406	I	0	“ So am I just supposed to act as her man of honor and smile and say yes to everything she picks ? ”
23476	23479	23480	23480	Lottie	96	“ Wait . ”
23488	23512	23480	23480	Lottie	96	“ You ’re going to be her maid of honor ? God , why do I find that the most precious thing ever ? ”
23513	23519	23520	23520	Kelsey	113	“ That ’s really cute , ”
23523	23559	23520	23520	Kelsey	113	“ And yes , you should . If you do n’t want to hurt her , only help , then you smile and be supportive . Also , quick question , who is The Beave ? ”
23560	23586	23406	23406	I	0	“ Brian ’s mom . Mrs. Beaver , we call her The Beave — not to her face . Think of Emily Gilmore but snobbier . ”
23587	23592	23593	23593	Lottie	96	“ Ooo , brutal , ”
23596	23669	23593	23593	Lottie	96	“ She ’s already been giving Lia a hard time . That ’s why the wedding is in five weeks , because of The Beave ’s demands . Brian ’s mom has been taking over everything , and last night when she was crying , I told her I would help her out , be there for her , but fuck , I did n’t get one ounce of sleep last night . ”
23676	23688	23670	23670	Lottie	96	“ Are you sure you do n’t have feelings for her ? ”
23689	23694	23695	23695	I	0	“ I do n’t ! ”
23720	23799	23717	23717	I	0	“ I do n’t . I think I ’m worried about what will happen when she marries Brian . She wo n’t be my neighbor anymore , that ’s for sure , and I doubt she ’ll be able to hang out with me as much , and if she does , it will involve Brian . I do n’t know . I feel like I ’m losing her , and I ’m going to lose her quickly . ”
23800	23808	23809	23809	JP	92	“ What if you talk to Brian ? ”
23812	23819	23820	23820	Kelsey	113	“ That ’s a good idea , ”
23823	23926	23820	23820	Kelsey	113	“ It seems as though the big problem is with him because let ’s be honest , this is n’t about picking out flowers that Lia likes . No matter what , you ’re going to make sure you help her in any way possible . This seems like you need to fix things with Brian to feel comfortable with Lia moving forward . Because she loves him and said yes to the proposal , which means she wants to move forward . She might be struggling because her best friend and soon - to - be husband do n’t get along . ”
23927	23931	23935	23935	she	96	“ Great point , ”
23941	23955	23935	23935	she	96	“ Fix things with Brian , and I bet it all works out . ”
23956	23970	23971	23971	I	0	“ But I ca n’t stand being in the same room as him , ”
23974	23985	23986	23986	JP	92	“ Looks like you ’re going to have to learn . ”
24288	24293	24299	24299	his	566	“ Hey , man , ”
24303	24325	24326	24326	He	566	“ Sorry about the wait . I was closing in a conversation with a client who wants to invest in bitcoin . ”
24332	24337	24329	24329	his	566	“ How are you ? ”
24349	24353	24354	24354	I	0	“ Doing good , ”
24376	24383	24358	24358	Brian	100	“ I heard about the lawsuit . ”
24438	24443	24444	24444	Brian	100	“ Hostile work environment ? ”
24449	24458	24446	24446	his	566	“ I do n’t believe it one bit . ”
24483	24502	24446	24446	his	566	“ Yeah , ca n’t really talk about it for legal reasons , but thanks for the support . ”
24525	24545	24557	24558	the server	569	“ Aw , sure , yeah . I get it . I ’m sure your team is handling things . ”
24546	24552	24553	24553	I	0	“ Like they always do . ”
24586	24589	24590	24590	Brian	100	“ So , ”
24593	24605	24590	24590	Brian	100	“ Lia told me she told you about the big news . ”
24608	24615	24616	24616	I	0	“ Yeah , congrats , dude , ”
24640	24658	24636	24636	me	0	“ You already know this , but you ’re going to marry the best girl out there . ”
24659	24720	24746	24746	she	572	“ I do know it . I ’m really fucking lucky and so glad she said yes . When I proposed , there was a bit of a pause in her answer , and I thought she was going to say no . But I chalked it up to a hitch in her breath from excitement before she said yes . ”
24759	24767	24768	24768	I	0	“ The ring is amazing , too , ”
24785	24799	24746	24746	she	572	“ Thanks . When I saw it , I immediately thought of Lia . ”
24807	24817	24818	24818	I	0	“ So five weeks ? That ’s pretty quick , ”
24821	24851	24818	24818	I	0	“ My mom is pressing it to be five weeks . There ’s a reason behind it . Lia must have told you she was apprehensive about the timeline . ”
24852	24855	24856	24856	I	0	“ Yup , ”
24874	24957	24856	24856	I	0	“ Yeah , it ’s quick for me too , but the reason is all there . I ’m just glad you ’ll help her through it . Lia said now that you have time off with the investigation , you can go to the appointments with her . My mother can be strong - willed , so it will be good that you ’re there to help Lia . Just wish I could , but I ’m totally slammed at work . ”
24958	24963	24964	24964	I	0	“ I ’m sure . ”
24992	25064	24986	24990	the better man of course	575	“ So since you guys are going to be married soon , I thought it would be good if we got together and , I do n’t know . . . just talked . Maybe get some grievances off our chest that we might have and start on a clean slate . I feel like there ’s been some tension between us . Or have I been reading the situation wrong ? ”
25065	25073	25074	25074	he	576	“ Nah , things have been weird , ”
25077	25095	25074	25074	he	576	“ I think it was after that chatter about the stocks . Things went downhill from there . ”
25121	25124	25125	25125	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
25140	25148	25125	25125	I	0	“ That was when things got weird . ”
25164	25204	25149	25149	He	576	“ I ’ll be honest . I felt intimidated by your friendship with Lia and of course your success with your brothers , and I went about it in all the wrong ways . I ’m sorry about that . ”
25268	25286	25260	25260	I	0	“ Thank you for the apology . That , uh , that means a lot , man . ”
25287	25324	25260	25260	I	0	“ Yeah , I should have done it a while ago , maybe things would n’t have been so awkward between us and we could have hung out more , but pride is a funny thing . ”
25325	25339	25260	25260	I	0	“ I get that . I probably should have approached you earlier too . ”
25340	25355	25356	25356	I	0	“ Why are you approaching me now ? Besides the wedding coming in close . ”
25359	25415	25356	25356	I	0	“ Just thought that maybe it would be best for everyone . I think Lia sensed the tension between us , and she ’s already stressed , so I did n’t want to stress her out even more . I thought if I could remove a stressor for her , it might ease her mind . ”
25441	25444	25445	25445	he	579	“ Thoughtful , ”
25550	25627	25547	25547	I	0	“ And with you guys getting married , I do n’t want to lose her . I know things will change because she will be your wife , and I ’m going to respect that . I wo n’t be able to drop in all the time as I do now , and I know our friend dates will be few and far between . I just do n’t want any awkwardness to get between us . ”
25631	25637	25641	25641	he	582	“ I can understand that . ”
25811	25824	25825	25825	He	582	“ You know , I ’ve always admired your friendship with Lia . ”
25831	25842	25825	25825	He	582	“ That ’s all it ’s ever been , right ? ”
25857	25860	25861	25861	I	0	“ Yes , ”
25871	25900	25861	25861	I	0	“ She ’s my best friend , that ’s it , nothing more . You do n’t need to worry about anything other than us just being friends . ”
25905	25940	25901	25901	He	582	“ Well , if that ’s the case , I ’m supposed to have Lia all to myself this weekend , but I would love to go out on a double date with you . ”
25941	25972	25853	25853	he	582	“ Oh , that would be cool , but I ’m not seeing anyone at the moment , so your double date would sort of be a third wheel situation . ”
25973	25993	25901	25901	He	582	“ I ’m aware of your dating status . That ’s why I have the perfect person for you . ”
26000	26014	26015	26015	Brian	100	“ You have someone for me to go out on a date with ? ”
26018	26099	25853	25853	he	582	“ Yeah . Her name is Birdy . She is my buddy ’s sister , and she ’s been having a hard time finding a genuine guy . He was telling me about it last night , and I thought , you know , I might have the perfect person for her . And since , you know , you do n’t have any romantic feelings for anyone else , this might be the perfect chance to meet someone new . ”
26189	26194	26173	26173	him	587	“ A double date . ”
26201	26206	26195	26195	I	0	“ Sounds like fun . ”
26294	26297	26298	26298	Brian	100	“ Great . ”
26306	26321	26298	26298	Brian	100	“ I ’ll set everything up and have Lia relay the info to you . ”
26322	26326	26327	26327	I	0	“ Sounds great , ”
27077	27083	27084	27084	I	0	“ Today is the day ! ”
27122	27126	27131	27131	he	68	“ Good morning ! ”
27127	27130	27131	27131	he	68	“ Grrrrrrr , ”
27137	27144	27145	27145	I	0	“ Time to rise and shine , ”
27164	27170	27148	27148	I	0	“ It ’s date day . ”
27171	27186	27187	27187	he	68	“ Which is not until tonight , so why are you bothering me now ? ”
27217	27221	27222	27222	I	0	“ My God ! ”
27229	27235	27222	27222	I	0	“ Your butt is showing . ”
27236	27254	27255	27255	He	68	“ That ’s what you get for walking in on me . You know I sleep naked . ”
27260	27267	27255	27255	He	68	“ How would I know that ? ”
27268	27282	27283	27283	His	68	“ You ’re my best friend . You should know everything about me . ”
27298	27347	27348	27348	He	68	“ Like I know that if I were to remove this pillow , I would find you in a pair of bike shorts , some random Zelda shirt , and your hair clipped up because you ca n’t have it touching your neck so early in the morning . ”
27378	27385	27370	27370	he	68	“ That was a lucky guess . ”
27386	27391	27392	27392	He	68	“ Not a guess . ”
27397	27484	27392	27392	He	68	“ All knowledge up here . Let me guess , you also ordered breakfast to lessen the blow of waking me up , and it will be here in five minutes . You ordered pancakes because you ’ve been craving them . Still , you did n’t get them from your favorite place because you know I prefer the breakfast burrito from Salty ’s . Hence , you caved and ordered from there despite them not having the maple - walnut syrup you love so much . ”
27485	27501	27502	27502	His	68	“ You know , it ’s unflattering to be a know - it - all . ”
27509	27521	27527	27527	he	68	“ Not trying to flatter you , so no problem there . ”
27537	27543	27527	27527	he	68	“ Toss me my shorts . ”
27796	27803	27804	27804	he	68	“ This burrito better be good , ”
27903	27912	27913	27913	Breaker	68	“ I can smell the raspberry from here , ”
28012	28026	28009	28009	I	0	“ It ’s potent because I have n’t unleashed it in a while . ”
28027	28038	28039	28039	he	68	“ When was the last time you had breakfast here ? ”
28050	28064	28042	28042	he	68	“ I do n’t know , we ’ve been doing dinners more lately . ”
28065	28107	28108	28108	I	0	“ Yeah , because you spend a lot of weekend nights over at Brian ’s , and I ’m usually rushing around in the morning on weekdays looking to get to work . I do n’t have time for casual breakfasts . ”
28119	28138	28108	28108	I	0	“ Well , now that you ’re on sabbatical , you have all the time in the world . ”
28139	28157	28158	28158	He	68	“ Maybe this time will give me a moment to get to know . . . Birdy . ”
28167	28177	28160	28160	his	68	“ You know , I cyberstalked her last night . ”
28178	28190	28108	28108	I	0	“ Did you really ? What did you come up with ? ”
28191	28199	28160	28160	his	68	“ Would n’t you like to know ? ”
28200	28206	28207	28207	He	68	“ Yeah , I would . ”
28212	28228	28207	28207	He	68	“ Come on , spill . Tell me what I ’m getting myself into tonight . ”
28262	28274	28243	28243	I	0	“ Okay , first of all , she ’s really pretty . ”
28275	28291	28292	28292	I	0	“ Looks are n’t everything , but that ’s a bonus . Let me see . ”
28334	28345	28330	28330	his	68	“ Wow , okay , yeah . She ’s beautiful . ”
28351	28358	28346	28346	I	0	“ But she ’s a blonde . ”
28359	28369	28370	28370	He	68	“ Yeah , think I can get over that . ”
28375	28382	28370	28370	He	68	“ What else do you have ? ”
28491	28526	28471	28471	He	68	“ So , uh , she really likes baseball . She loves the Chicago Rebels . Not sure who they are , but she has some fan page dedicated to a player ’s butt . ”
28527	28549	28560	28560	he	68	“ Which means she ’s a butt person . That bodes well for me , as I have a nice ass . ”
28550	28554	28560	28560	he	68	“ Do you ? ”
28555	28559	28560	28560	he	68	“ Oh please , ”
28563	28586	28560	28560	he	68	“ You know I do , and do n’t even try to deny it . What else do you have on her ? ”
28602	28616	28597	28600	An annoyingly nice butt	629	“ She likes . . . get this . . . romantic comedies . ”
28617	28624	28625	28625	I	0	“ What ’s wrong with that ? ”
28633	28641	28625	28625	I	0	“ Breaker , they ’re so cliché . ”
28642	28647	28648	28648	he	68	“ For a reason , ”
28651	28710	28648	28648	he	68	“ They bring joy to people . I know Kelsey and Lottie are obsessed with them . They ’ve changed my mind . I can see the appeal . Something about having hope at the end of a story , knowing that it ’s all going to end well , makes you feel all warm and cozy inside . ”
28727	28742	28711	28711	I	0	“ What have you done with my best friend ? You hate romantic comedies . ”
28751	28769	28743	28743	He	68	“ People can change , Lia . It ’s okay . The world wo n’t fall apart . ”
28780	28793	28770	28770	He	68	“ Are you jealous I ’m going out with this girl tonight ? ”
28794	28797	28798	28798	I	0	“ What ? ”
28802	28811	28812	28812	He	68	“ Why on earth would I be jealous ? ”
28830	28846	28812	28812	He	68	“ Because you ’re supposed to be the only woman in my life , right ? ”
28847	28855	28856	28856	He	68	“ Well , yes . Of course . ”
28871	28886	28887	28887	He	68	“ Do n’t worry , Lia , you ’ll always be my best friend . ”
28895	28910	28887	28887	He	68	“ But you ca n’t offer me benefits , and a guy has needs . ”
28927	28938	28920	28920	I	0	“ Ew , gross . Do n’t be that guy . ”
28939	28963	28964	28964	He	68	“ Lia , I ’ve always been that guy , but you just do n’t see it because you ’d give me shit . ”
28977	28991	28974	28974	I	0	“ So you think you ’ll like her ? Go out with her ? ”
28998	29002	28992	28992	I	0	“ Have sex ? ”
29003	29077	29126	29126	He	630	“ Jumping the gun a bit , but I ’m open . And I mean , she ’s really pretty . Who knows , maybe I ’ll be taking her as my date to your wedding . Maybe she ’ll catch the bouquet , maybe I ’ll catch the garter , and we ’ll have a whirlwind romance where Bertha , Bernard , and Barabbas are n’t just a thought but a reality . ”
29078	29088	29126	29126	He	630	“ All because of Brian . Could you imagine ? ”
29089	29108	28992	28992	I	0	“ Honestly , I ca n’t , but I ’m just going with the flow at this point . ”
29109	29114	29115	29115	I	0	“ And why exactly ? ”
29142	29186	29126	29126	He	630	“ Because I want to make sure you ’re happy , Lia . I know how stressed you are about all of this , and if I can ease some of that stress , then I ’m going to do that for you . ”
29187	29202	29133	29133	he	630	“ You do n’t have to ease the stress by going out with Birdy . ”
29203	29218	29219	29219	I	0	“ It ’s one date , and it ’s more for Brian than anything . ”
29224	29236	29219	29219	I	0	“ And when have you ever started doing things for Brian ? ”
29237	29259	29260	29260	he	630	“ Since he ’s going to be your husband and . . . and I do n’t want to lose you , ”
29307	29320	29321	29321	He	630	“ What ? Breaker , you ’re not going to lose me . ”
29330	29423	29321	29321	He	630	“ Lia , we have to be real about this . In five weeks , things are really going to change . You ’re no longer going to live next to me . You ’re going to be occupied with your new life , and sure , I know you wo n’t forget me , but I do n’t want there to be any reason for there to be distance between us other than actual distance . I do n’t want to give Brian a reason to put a wedge between us . ”
29424	29431	29432	29432	I	0	“ I would n’t let him , ”
29435	29501	29432	29432	I	0	“ I know , but if I do n’t get along with him , that could hurt your marriage . There could be resentment , so yeah , I ’m going to do something for him . Sure , because I know if I do this little thing for him , I wo n’t run the risk of not getting to hang out with you . ”
29573	29595	29596	29596	I	0	“ Do you really think life will change that much ? I mean . . . you could always move close . ”
29599	29612	29596	29596	I	0	“ Your brothers live across the street . That could be us . ”
29621	29633	29634	29634	His	68	“ Are you . . . asking me to follow you ? ”
29658	29747	29644	29644	I	0	“ Not if you ’re going to be obnoxious about it , but yes , it does n’t have to be a straight cut - off when I get married . Brian understands our relationship , and who knows , if things work out with Birdy , maybe we can continue to go on double dates . And on those double dates , we can annoy them with our history by talking about all the college fun we had while they just sit there and stare at us . ”
29748	29770	29771	29771	I	0	“ And when you say college fun , you really mean all the nerdy and embarrassing things we still do today . ”
29781	29784	29771	29771	I	0	“ Precisely . ”
29788	29794	29795	29795	Breaker	68	“ Lia , you ready ? ”
30375	30380	30381	30381	he	68	“ Wow , Lia , ”
30396	30404	30381	30381	he	68	“ Shit , you look really good . ”
30429	30450	30412	30412	I	0	“ Oh , thank you . I , uh , I thought I would match the fanciness of my ring . ”
30467	30482	30451	30451	I	0	“ See ? Fancy . And I ’m fancy . We ’re all fancy . ”
30487	30491	30451	30451	I	0	“ You okay ? ”
30492	30507	30508	30508	He	68	“ Yes , great . Thank you . Just telling you I ’m fancy . ”
30511	30522	30523	30523	He	68	“ All right , well , glad we established that . ”
30531	30536	30525	30525	his	68	“ Ready to go ? ”
30537	30566	30508	30508	He	68	“ Yeah , of course . So ready . Never been more ready . Just the most ready , so let ’s get this show on the road . ”
30567	30573	30574	30574	he	68	“ You ’re being weird , ”
30619	30644	30612	30612	I	0	“ No , I ’m not . Ca n’t a friend just tell another friend how fancy they feel ? Is that a crime ? ”
30645	30664	30665	30665	I	0	“ Not that I ’m aware of , but I can google it if you want me to . ”
30765	30773	30774	30774	I	0	“ Why have you always been secretive ? ”
30778	30783	30784	30784	he	68	“ Err , what ? ”
30807	30834	30784	30784	he	68	“ With dating , you ’ve never talked about it . You ’ve never told me anything about the women you see . Why is that ? ”
30835	30842	30843	30843	he	68	“ Where is this coming from ? ”
30872	30908	30909	30909	I	0	“ This is . . . this is not the Breaker I ’m used to . I do n’t see you dress like this , all suave and , you know . . . handsome . ”
30923	30936	30937	30937	He	68	“ Yeah , well , I never see you like this either . ”
30944	30980	30937	30937	He	68	“ All dressed up and . . . beautiful . Normally , I hang out with the troll lady who lives next door and has a penchant for eating green olives straight from the jar . ”
30998	31006	30986	30986	I	0	“ I ’m not a troll lady . ”
31018	31029	31030	31030	He	68	“ Your matted hair the other day told me otherwise . ”
31067	31122	31057	31057	He	68	“ I do n’t talk about it much because there is n’t much to talk about . And I ’m not the type of guy who runs around to his friends , telling them about the pussy I scored the night before . But if you so desire , I can start doing that . ”
31123	31130	31057	31057	He	68	“ Do you score a lot ? ”
31131	31195	31247	31247	I	0	“ More than you ’re probably aware , but since you ’re curious , I ’ve gone through a bit of a drought as of recently . Just have n’t had time . I think the last woman I was with , if you must know , is your friend Charise , the one you hooked me up with for Huxley ’s wedding . ”
31196	31201	31202	31202	I	0	“ Wait , seriously ? ”
31205	31212	31202	31202	I	0	“ You hooked up with Charise ? ”
31213	31218	31219	31219	He	649	“ A few times . ”
31250	31263	31247	31247	I	0	“ A few times ? Like . . . more than once ? ”
31264	31274	31275	31275	He	649	“ That ’s usually what a few times means . ”
31289	31325	31275	31275	He	649	“ But she never said anything to me . You never said anything to me . How am I supposed to know you ’re hooking up with my friend ? Did anything come of it ? ”
31326	31346	31247	31247	I	0	“ Triplets , actually . Not humans , puppies . She has custody , but I have visitation rights . ”
31347	31355	31356	31356	I	0	“ I ’m being serious , Breaker . ”
31367	31395	31356	31356	I	0	“ Nah , it was just sex . Neither of us was looking for anything serious , plus there was no connection other than a carnal one . ”
31401	31409	31398	31398	his	649	“ Ew , do n’t say carnal . ”
31432	31453	31420	31420	Breaker	68	“ So you ’re just out there dating , having a good time , and not telling me about it ? ”
31454	31471	31472	31472	he	649	“ Why would I tell you ? Just so you can push me and say ew ? ”
31479	31484	31485	31485	He	649	“ Well , yeah . ”
31488	31498	31485	31485	He	649	“ Thanks , but I think I ’ll pass . ”
31499	31519	31420	31420	Breaker	68	“ So tonight , are you going to be all . . . touchy - feely and Date Breaker ? ”
31520	31551	31420	31420	Breaker	68	“ If you ’re staring me down the whole time , then no . Not sure I can put on the moves when your judgmental glare is directed my way . ”
31552	31561	31485	31485	He	649	“ Judgmental ? Nothing about me is judgmental . ”
31562	31565	31566	31566	He	649	“ Ha ! ”
31569	31587	31566	31566	He	649	“ Lia , you were judging Birdy earlier today when you saw that she likes romantic comedies . ”
31588	31626	31485	31485	He	649	“ Uh , you used to make fun of them until apparently recently , thanks to your sisters - in - law . The question really is , do I even know you at all , Breaker ? ”
31627	31632	31633	31633	He	649	“ You tell me . ”
31746	31752	31737	31737	I	0	“ Name my biggest fear . ”
31753	31762	31763	31763	I	0	“ We do n’t need to do this , ”
31769	31775	31776	31776	He	649	“ Yes , we do . ”
31781	31801	31776	31776	He	649	“ Come on , what ’s my biggest fear ? And you ’re the only one who knows this . ”
31802	31829	31830	31830	He	649	“ House fire where you ca n’t get your signed Lord of the Rings memorabilia out of the house fast enough , and you lose it . ”
31837	31857	31830	31830	He	649	“ Still gets me just thinking about it . My turn , you ask me a question about you . ”
31858	31865	31776	31776	He	649	“ Why are we doing this ? ”
31866	31896	31776	31776	He	649	“ To prove to you that we know each other better than any other person and that will never change . So go ahead , ask me a question . ”
31897	31908	31776	31776	He	649	“ Fine . What is my least favorite childhood memory ? ”
31909	31982	31776	31776	He	649	“ The day you got your period . You were at a friend ’s house for a sleepover and got it in the middle of the night on the sleeping bag you borrowed from your friend . She made you feel bad because you stained it , and then you had to wait for your mom to pick you up . Courtney is a real bitch who I hope burns in hell . ”
31988	32005	31776	31776	He	649	“ She did n’t have to torment me about the stain , that ’s for sure . ”
32006	32035	31776	31776	He	649	“ Yeah , well , hopefully , karma has repaid her in the form of a corn on the bottom of her foot . That shit is painful . ”
32036	32042	31776	31776	He	649	“ One could only hope . ”
32043	32054	32055	32055	he	659	“ Okay , what is my least favorite childhood memory ? ”
32130	32137	32138	32138	I	0	“ When your dad passed away , ”
32142	32191	32138	32138	I	0	“ And how you wish you told him you loved him more than you did . How you regret not saying that to him enough . I remember that like it was yesterday because I clung to that and always told my parents I loved them after that . ”
32196	32270	32192	32192	He	659	“ And you ’re the only person who knows that . I never told my brothers . I never told another soul . So I might not talk about the menial things like the girls I take out or hook up with because it has no value to our friendship . But the important things ? Those are the things I tell you about , and that ’s what should matter the most . ”
32271	32281	32138	32138	I	0	“ Why are you trying to make me emotional ? ”
32282	32292	32293	32293	He	659	“ I ’m not trying to make you emotional . ”
32303	32364	32293	32293	He	659	“ I ’m just trying to tell you that no matter what happens , you will always know me best , and there ’s a reason for that . You ’re my best friend , Lia . Nothing can come between that . I wo n’t let it happen . Hence us driving downtown to go on a double date . ”
32365	32379	32138	32138	I	0	“ You ’re a really good guy , you know that , Breaker ? ”
32380	32384	32385	32385	His	659	“ I try . ”
32393	32410	32385	32385	His	659	“ Now , let me show you a new song that I ’ve been simping over . ”
32411	32428	32138	32138	I	0	“ Oh my God , do not say simping . You can not pull it off . ”
32429	32433	32434	32434	he	659	“ Says who ? ”
32440	32444	32434	32434	he	659	“ Says me . ”
32445	32453	32138	32138	I	0	“ And who made you the authority ? ”
32454	32458	32138	32138	I	0	“ I did . ”
32459	32466	32467	32467	He	659	“ Ehh , that ’s fair . ”
32883	32890	32891	32891	Brian	100	“ Have you been here before ? ”
32894	32902	32903	32903	I	0	“ I do n’t believe I have , ”
32906	32913	32914	32914	She	168	“ What about you , Birdy ? ”
32919	32932	32916	32916	her	168	“ No , it ’s probably the fanciest place I ’ve been . ”
32933	32945	32946	32946	Brian	100	“ Well , the wagyu is magnificent if you like steak , ”
32955	32972	32946	32946	Brian	100	“ And please , feel free to get whatever you like . Dinner is on me . ”
32973	32981	32982	32982	I	0	“ Oh , that ’s not necessary , ”
33000	33014	32992	32992	His	670	“ This was my idea . Therefore , I ’ll be treating everyone . ”
33091	33106	33107	33107	I	0	“ Well , thank you . That ’s really kind of you , Brian , ”
33253	33260	33261	33261	I	0	“ So where are you from ? ”
33265	33297	33263	33263	her	118	“ Originally Tennessee , but I ’ve lived in Los Angeles for the past ten years . I went to school here and loved it so much I decided to stay . ”
33298	33315	33316	33316	She	118	“ Hard to leave California once you live here . Did you study marketing in school ? ”
33326	33349	33316	33316	She	118	“ I did . And my master ’s . I ’ve always been good at spinning a good story to sell something . ”
33355	33406	33352	33352	my	0	“ It takes a creative mind to be in your field . When my brothers and I first started building our business , we had to work on our marketing , and Huxley , my eldest brother , thought it would be smart to give me the job of branding . ”
33417	33429	33407	33407	I	0	“ Let ’s just say that did n’t go over well . ”
33430	33435	33436	33436	Lia	168	“ Oh come on , ”
33440	33449	33436	33436	Lia	168	“ I really liked the logo you created . ”
33450	33458	33459	33459	I	0	“ Do n’t even bring it up , ”
33470	33474	33475	33475	Birdy	118	“ Oh goodness , ”
33478	33492	33475	33475	Birdy	118	“ I have to see this now . Do you have a picture ? ”
33493	33497	33498	33498	Lia	168	“ I do , ”
33509	33541	33502	33502	her	168	“ I have a folder in my phone of all of the embarrassing things Breaker has done over the years . It comes in handy when I need to ground him . ”
33542	33548	33549	33549	I	0	“ Which is not often , ”
33564	33572	33573	33573	Lia	168	“ Often enough to have a folder . ”
33586	33613	33614	33614	Birdy	118	“ So he combined an H for Huxley , a J for JP , and a B for him all together with a C as well . ”
33617	33629	33630	33630	Lia	168	“ It looks like a bunch of crumpled - up letters . ”
33633	33640	33630	33630	Lia	168	“ He was going for simple . ”
33641	33706	33723	33724	The server	569	“ To my defense , I had no right being in charge of this . I never said I had any design experience , and it was poor judgment on my brothers ’ part for putting me in charge of this task . But I was smart enough to suck at it , which made us spend the money to get it done professionally . ”
33707	33710	33711	33711	Birdy	118	“ Smart , ”
33714	33722	33711	33711	Birdy	118	“ Always leave it to the professionals . ”
33764	33822	33755	33755	I	0	“ Just a brother . But he ’s ten years older than me , so we ’ve never been super close . Not like best friends , but we do look out for each other . But friends , probably not like you and your brothers , I assume . You must be close to work together . ”
33823	33866	33896	33896	her	680	“ Very close , sometimes obnoxiously close . We get into each other ’s business way too much . When I ’m the one who is n’t needing help or has n’t done something stupid , I enjoy watching the drama unfold . ”
33867	33881	33972	33972	Lia	168	“ Would you say you ’re in charge of mediation in your family ? ”
33882	33886	33887	33887	I	0	“ I am , ”
33913	33925	33905	33906	the server	569	“ Does it seem like I would be the mediating type ? ”
33926	33950	33978	33978	I	0	“ You ’re very calm . You have this air about you that makes me think that you like to keep the peace . ”
33951	33955	33956	33956	I	0	“ I do , ”
33959	33967	33956	33956	I	0	“ Do n’t care much for drama . ”
33968	33971	33972	33972	Lia	168	“ Pffft , ”
33984	33990	33978	33978	I	0	“ Care to weigh in ? ”
33991	34045	33956	33956	I	0	“ Uh , senior year , the second semester during the Scrabble championships , you were living for the drama . You were part of the drama . Flirting with two girls from the same team , creating an uproar when they found out . . . in the middle of the game . ”
34046	34061	34062	34062	I	0	“ That ’s not drama , Lia . That ’s called strategic Scrabble play . ”
34070	34119	34062	34062	I	0	“ Mental fortitude is a key component to winning championships , and if you can mess with your opponent in any way to throw off that mental fortitude , then you have to . So yeah , I took one for the team and flirted with two women . ”
34127	34146	34120	34120	I	0	“ I do n’t ever do that in real life , just need to put that out there . ”
34151	34164	34147	34147	She	118	“ Does n’t seem like you would be that kind of guy . ”
34165	34198	34199	34199	Brian	100	“ Hey , Lia , why do n’t we go stand out on the balcony while the food takes some time to cook , give these two some alone time to chat ? ”
34206	34213	34214	34214	Lia	168	“ Oh , sure , yeah , ”
34288	34295	34296	34296	Birdy	118	“ They ’re so cute together , ”
34299	34305	34296	34296	Birdy	118	“ Yeah , they are , ”
34322	34330	34331	34331	Birdy	118	“ So you met Lia in college ? ”
34334	34380	34331	34331	Birdy	118	“ Yeah , we were part of a secret Scrabble group , and she was very impressive with her spelling skills . After her first night , we sort of bonded over all things that interested us , and we ’ve been best friends since . ”
34381	34397	34331	34331	Birdy	118	“ That ’s so cool . What were some of the things you bonded over ? ”
34398	34401	34402	34402	I	0	“ Uhh . ”
34415	34445	34402	34402	I	0	“ If I tell you , it might deter you from wanting to stick around on this date because Lia and I do n’t usually like mainstream popular things . ”
34446	34450	34451	34451	She	683	“ Try me . ”
34463	34469	34451	34451	She	683	“ I might surprise you . ”
34470	34473	34474	34474	I	0	“ Okay . ”
34484	34736	34474	34474	I	0	“ I have a deep obsession for Lord of the Rings . I read the books when I was younger , became quickly obsessed , and have n’t looked back since . I ’ve dressed up as Gandalf for Halloween far too many times for me to count . I enjoy building model airplanes and flying them . I find it incredibly soothing . I ’m an avid board gamer . I will try any game at least once . I prefer the ones where I go on a quest . Sports do n’t really interest me . I ’ll watch them , but I ’m not a diehard fan . I ’ve been known to enjoy a comic book from time to time , but nothing mainstream like Marvel or DC . There ’s this one line of comic books about Sherlock Holmes that I really enjoy reading . I ’m tempting the line of becoming a Disney adult . I ’m an annual ticket holder , will attend the Halloween party every year , and have a sick obsession with The Nightmare Before Christmas as well as Mulan . The montage where she ‘ becomes a man ’ gives me chills every time . And my favorite movie is The Thin Man . There ’s a whole series of them , and in the late fall , there ’s an old movie theater downtown that will put on a marathon of them . Lia and I go every year . ”
34756	34771	34752	34752	she	118	“ A hot nerd , I think I can get on board with that . ”
34794	34802	34803	34803	Brian	100	“ What do you think , man ? ”
34806	34815	34803	34803	Brian	100	“ She ’s great , is n’t she ? ”
34852	34860	34861	34861	I	0	“ Yeah , she ’s pretty awesome , ”
34880	34906	34861	34861	I	0	“ Seems like we have some differences when it comes to interests , but she did say she enjoys hiking , which is a plus . ”
34940	34953	34954	34954	Lia	168	“ Did you tell her that you like birdwatching when you hike ? ”
34957	34977	34978	34978	Brian	100	“ Uh , skipped out on the part where I mention my binoculars , bucket hat , and notebook . ”
34981	34991	34978	34978	Brian	100	“ I bet that ’s a sight to behold . ”
34992	35007	35026	35026	her	168	“ Not many people get to see that side of me for that reason . ”
35008	35022	35023	35023	Lia	168	“ I do n’t know . I think the bucket hat looks good , ”
35042	35059	35039	35039	his	687	“ So would I be safe to assume that you ’ll be driving Birdy home tonight ? ”
35060	35069	35070	35070	I	0	“ If she needs a ride , sure , ”
35073	35082	35083	35083	Lia	168	“ Will you be asking her out again ? ”
35090	35120	35087	35087	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Maybe . She seems cool , and getting to know her without an audience who likes to share embarrassing pictures might be helpful . ”
35121	35129	35145	35145	Birdy	118	“ But those are the best pic — ”
35130	35140	35141	35141	Brian	100	“ Well , do n’t let us keep you , ”
35185	35214	35173	35173	Brian	100	“ I ’ve already taken care of the bill . Lia and I are going to head out as it ’s a bit of a drive to Malibu . ”
35215	35221	35222	35222	I	0	“ Yeah , of course , ”
35274	35278	35279	35279	I	0	“ You good ? ”
35299	35305	35290	35290	I	0	“ Have a good weekend . ”
35306	35311	35312	35312	she	168	“ Okay . Thanks , ”
35358	35378	35352	35352	I	0	“ Text me about next week and your appointments . You know I ’ll be at all of them . ”
35379	35383	35384	35384	She	168	“ I will . ”
35410	35433	35399	35399	He	689	“ Good seeing you , Breaker . Have fun , the night is still early . Maybe take Birdy out for dessert . ”
35439	35447	35437	35437	Jesus	90	“ Sure , thanks again for dinner . ”
35478	35481	35459	35459	She	118	“ So . ”
35490	35507	35508	35508	She	118	“ Uh . . . when I go on hikes , it ’s more for birdwatching . ”
35511	35529	35508	35508	She	118	“ Just want to put that out there before I ask if you want to get dessert . ”
35530	35555	35581	35581	her	118	“ Birdwatching , huh ? Seems like a good time . Do n’t know much about birds , but I do n’t mind learning . ”
35556	35571	35508	35508	She	118	“ If that ’s the case , would you like to go for dessert ? ”
35572	35578	35579	35579	Birdy	118	“ I would love it . ”
35598	35606	35607	35607	Birdy	118	“ Okay , this cheesecake is amazing , ”
35615	35623	35607	35607	Birdy	118	“ The raspberry swirl should be illegal . ”
35624	35632	35633	35633	I	0	“ I told you it was good , ”
35641	35647	35633	35633	I	0	“ And you doubted me . ”
35648	35673	35607	35607	Birdy	118	“ I did n’t doubt you . I was just thrown off . I was n’t expecting to grab dessert from a food truck . ”
35674	35681	35682	35682	I	0	“ I live off food trucks , ”
35689	35730	35682	35682	I	0	“ Near where we live is a taco truck that makes the best fucking tacos with dipping sauce . Lia and I try to limit ourselves , but it does n’t help that they ’re parked right around the corner . ”
35731	35741	35742	35742	Birdy	118	“ Do you and Lia eat dinner together often ? ”
35745	35764	35742	35742	Birdy	118	“ Uh , not really . Maybe like twice a week . Whenever she ’s not with Brian . ”
35765	35783	35682	35682	I	0	“ I wish I lived near my friends . It would make it easier to hang out . ”
35784	35789	35790	35790	She	693	“ It is convenient . ”
35800	35830	35790	35790	She	693	“ I think I ’m overstepping when I ask this , but I guess I ’m just curious . Have you and Lia ever been . . . romantic ? ”
35836	35889	35831	35831	I	0	“ Nah , we ’re just friends . Never even thought about it . I guess it ’s an honest question to ask when you see two people of the opposite sex hanging out as much as we do . My brothers always ask me despite me giving them the same answer . ”
35890	35950	35682	35682	I	0	“ I ’m sorry if that was inappropriate . I was put through the wringer with my last relationship , so I guess I just want to be up front and honest , not that this is a relationship or that you want to ask me out again , but just in case , I like to cover everything . ”
35951	35976	35831	35831	I	0	“ I get that . I ’ve , uh , I ’ve never really been in anything serious , nor do I date much . ”
35977	35982	35983	35983	she	694	“ Oh , really ? ”
35986	35998	35983	35983	she	694	“ I guess that was stupid of me to assume otherwise . ”
35999	36019	35831	35831	I	0	“ No , not stupid . We did go on a double date , so your assumption is valid . ”
36033	36067	36020	36020	She	694	“ So why do n’t you date much , Breaker ? You seem like a pretty levelheaded guy . Sweet . Kind . Thoughtful . Why are n’t you putting yourself out there ? ”
36068	36076	36077	36077	I	0	“ Going deep tonight , are we ? ”
36080	36145	36077	36077	I	0	“ Well , I guess I just have n’t found the person I want to spend more time with . It ’s not that I ’m against dating , but I just have n’t clicked with someone enough to spend more time , if that makes sense . And with my busy schedule , I have n’t really put the feelers out there either . ”
36149	36155	36156	36156	She	694	“ I can understand that . ”
36164	36178	36156	36156	She	694	“ And I guess you ’re not that lonely because you have Lia . ”
36192	36195	36196	36196	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
36200	36235	36196	36196	I	0	“ So what happens after she gets married ? Do you think you two will hang out as much ? And I ask that not in a mean way , just trying to understand . ”
36236	36276	36277	36277	I	0	“ Do n’t worry about insulting me or anything like that . I get the curiosity . And we talked about it a little today , said we could find a house near each other , still hang out . ”
36285	36330	36277	36277	I	0	“ I do n’t know . I ’m not sure how much we will see each other , though . I know we ’ll never forget about each other , but I do know our dinner dates will probably become few and far between . ”
36331	36344	36345	36345	Birdy	118	“ I can only imagine they would because married life is different , ”
36352	36356	36345	36345	Birdy	118	“ It is . ”
36394	36407	36408	36408	She	118	“ Shit , Birdy , looks like I need to start dating . ”
36415	36423	36408	36408	She	118	“ Well , when you ’re ready . ”
36432	36465	36424	36424	I	0	“ Maybe I could be ready . What do you think ? Would you want to do this again ? Maybe not with such a sad ending talking about my pathetic life ? ”
36466	36523	36408	36408	She	118	“ It ’s not pathetic at all . I actually think it ’s sweet . My mom always told me that true friendships are hard to find , but they are the most important things to hang on to . What you have with Lia is so special . You want to hang on to that . ”
36524	36572	36573	36573	I	0	“ I do . But I think you ’re right . Married life will be different , and I might not be lonely now when I have her , but that will change after she ’s married . It ’s about time I put myself out there . ”
36581	36605	36573	36573	I	0	“ Would you like to go on a second date with me ? Maybe a hike ? I can show you some birds . ”
36610	36616	36606	36606	She	118	“ I would love that . ”
37077	37080	37086	37086	she	168	“ Hello ? ”
37089	37097	37086	37086	she	168	“ Are you trying to replace me ? ”
37098	37109	37086	37086	she	168	“ What ? No . Why would you say that ? ”
37110	37126	37086	37086	she	168	“ That last text , it sounds like you ’re trying to find a replacement . ”
37127	37232	37086	37086	she	168	“ Lia , come on , you know I ’m not trying to replace you . You could never be replaced , but let ’s be honest , as much as we like to believe things wo n’t change , they will . Brian will be your top priority once you ’re married , and you ca n’t let anything get in the way . Which means I ’m going to have some free time . I do n’t want to be sitting around in my apartment by myself all the time , so maybe it ’s time I go out and find someone . ”
37233	37252	37355	37355	I	0	“ You wo n’t be alone . We ’re going to live next to each other , remember ? ”
37253	37287	37086	37086	she	168	“ Still , Brian wo n’t want me over all the time , Lia . Face it , things are changing , and that ’s okay . We knew the time would come . ”
37288	37301	37302	37302	she	700	“ But . . . I do n’t want things to change , ”
37306	37315	37302	37302	she	700	“ I like things the way they are . ”
37362	37374	37355	37355	I	0	“ So then why did you say yes to his proposal ? ”
37402	37408	37390	37390	she	700	“ Because I love him . ”
37460	37480	37481	37481	She	700	“ Well , then , this is what happens when you fall in love , Lia . Things change . ”
37489	37506	37481	37481	She	700	“ But Birdy ? She does n’t seem like a person you would go out with . ”
37507	37514	37481	37481	She	700	“ Why do you say that ? ”
37515	37520	37524	37524	her	700	“ Well . . . ”
37530	37557	37524	37524	her	700	“ You do n’t have a lot in common . She seems like the popular girl type , and you ’re more on the interesting scale . ”
37558	37561	37562	37562	I	0	“ Interesting ? ”
37565	37572	37562	37562	I	0	“ Please describe that for me . ”
37573	37585	37524	37524	her	700	“ You just have different interests that do n’t match up . ”
37586	37597	37598	37598	I	0	“ And you and Brian have interests that match up ? ”
37606	37629	37598	37598	I	0	“ Last time I checked , he thinks it ’s lame that you and I freak out over a new board game . ”
37630	37636	37524	37524	her	700	“ He said that once . ”
37637	37642	37598	37598	I	0	“ Once is enough . ”
37643	37657	37598	37598	I	0	“ What are you saying ? Do you not want me marrying him ? ”
37668	37675	37676	37676	I	0	“ I did n’t say that . ”
37684	37791	37676	37676	I	0	“ I ’m just trying to say that sometimes interests do n’t match up , and that ’s okay . Look at you and Brian . You do n’t have everything in common , but your relationship still works . Look , I ’ve only met Birdy once , so I ’m not going to suggest that I ’ve met my future wife or anything . But what ’s the harm in finding out if we ’re compatible ? Maybe those different interests wo n’t be a deal breaker like they ’re not with you and Brian . There ’s only one way to find out . ”
37792	37805	37524	37524	her	700	“ So does that mean you ’re going out with her again ? ”
37806	37839	37598	37598	I	0	“ Yeah , we ’re going on a hike next weekend . I ’m going to teach her about birds . Who knows , maybe she ’ll become a fanatic like me . ”
37840	37851	37676	37676	I	0	“ What ’s with the Cane brothers and their birds ? ”
37852	37879	37524	37524	her	700	“ Hey , JP likes pigeons because he feels guilty about them not being loved , but he could n’t care less about other feathered friends . ”
37880	37896	37598	37598	I	0	“ Please , for the love of God , do n’t call them feathered friends . ”
37897	37948	37676	37676	I	0	“ Well , if I do n’t try to put myself out there and date , they very much might be my only friends , and although the solitude of being the crazy bird man sounds charming , I do n’t think I ’m ready for that title just yet . ”
37949	37965	37524	37524	her	700	“ I can see it , your poncho , a bucket hat . A cane . ”
37966	37977	37978	37978	She	705	“ Please . . . please do n’t envision that . ”
37984	37991	37978	37978	She	705	“ I ’m sorry , Breaker . ”
37992	37997	37998	37998	I	0	“ Sorry for what ? ”
38001	38061	37998	37998	I	0	“ Well , for one , waking you up . And also for giving you a hard time about Birdy . I guess I ’m just stressed with the many rapid changes . I was comfortable , content , and now my life feels like a whirlwind of change , and it ’s all happening at a frightening pace . ”
38062	38074	37676	37676	I	0	“ You know you have the choice to slow it down . ”
38075	38080	37524	37524	her	700	“ By disappointing others . ”
38081	38095	38096	38096	I	0	“ Yes , but it ’s for the sake of your mental health , ”
38099	38113	38096	38096	I	0	“ Do n’t try to please others just for the sake of it . ”
38114	38183	37524	37524	her	700	“ I know you ’re right , Breaker . I know you are , but I just do n’t have it in me to disappoint others . Brian is so sensitive . I think if I postponed , he ’d think it had to do with him , and I do n’t want him thinking that . I just need to take this one step at a time . ”
38184	38217	37524	37524	her	700	“ Okay , but just so you know , if you want to try to slow this down , you just let me know , and I ’ll step in and help . ”
38218	38242	38096	38096	I	0	“ I know , and I love you for that . Just promise me you will be here every step of the way . ”
38243	38247	38096	38096	I	0	“ I promise . ”
38248	38252	37524	37524	her	700	“ Thank you . ”
38256	38263	38264	38264	Breaker	68	“ Well , it ’s nice , ”
38335	38354	38325	38325	I	0	“ There are gargoyles on the edge of the roof . That does n’t really scream wedding vibes . ”
38362	38419	38355	38355	Breaker	68	“ Not really , but the reason gargoyles were carved into buildings in the first place was to ward off the evil spirits from entering , so . . . if you look at it that way , then maybe it ’s a good thing . There will be no evil spirits lurking in your marriage . ”
38443	38455	38420	38420	I	0	“ Are you going to put a positive spin on everything ? ”
38456	38503	38357	38357	his	68	“ I will until you tell me you absolutely hate it . At that point , I will jump the positivity ship , but you need to give it a fair shot first . Who knows , maybe the inside of the chapel really captivates you . ”
38504	38512	38357	38357	his	68	“ I ’m not religious , Breaker . ”
38513	38561	38420	38420	I	0	“ You do n’t need to be religious to appreciate the sanctity of divine architecture . Think about what it took for people to build this building back in the day . All the intricate carvings and details you do n’t see on today ’s modern aesthetic . ”
38562	38590	38357	38357	his	68	“ Correct me if I ’m wrong , but no Chipotle has gargoyles or intricate carvings , and I still very much enjoy walking into their establishments . ”
38591	38606	38357	38357	his	68	“ Because you ’re a whore for lime salt chips , just like Lottie . ”
38607	38614	38615	38615	I	0	“ How do you know that ? ”
38618	38691	38615	38615	I	0	“ That ’s where Huxley and Lottie were on their first official date , if that ’s what you want to call it . It ’s where they went over the terms of their fake fiancé contract . Honestly , saying it out loud really does n’t sound real . Anyway , she took home the chips that Huxley bought when he really wanted them . He bitched about it for days . ”
38692	38727	38357	38357	his	68	“ You guys are billionaires . You can buy your own Chipotle and turn it into a chip factory for your own personal pleasure . Why was he bitching about someone taking his chips ? ”
38728	38737	38738	38738	he	713	“ It ’s the principle of the thing , ”
38890	38895	38896	38896	she	111	“ Ophelia , hello , ”
38913	38927	38928	38928	She	111	“ Mr. Cane , what a treat for you to join us today . ”
38948	38974	38975	38975	He	68	“ Please , Breaker is just fine , and I could n’t miss an opportunity to be the perfect maid of honor for my girl . ”
38981	38986	38987	38988	The Beave	111	“ Maid of honor ? ”
38995	39014	38987	38988	The Beave	111	“ I was n’t aware that you would be having a man on your side of the altar . ”
39085	39101	39043	39043	she	111	“ Breaker is my best friend . I would n’t have it any other way . ”
39102	39110	39121	39121	Breaker	68	“ Well , maybe we can consider — ”
39111	39120	39121	39121	Breaker	68	“ It wo n’t be any other way , ”
39219	39223	39224	39225	The Beave	111	“ I see . ”
39229	39244	39245	39245	She	111	“ Well , then , I guess I will make a note of that . ”
39255	39270	39245	39245	She	111	“ You know , Breaker , I heard the news about your former employee . ”
39362	39369	39370	39370	Breaker	68	“ Tragic , is n’t it ? ”
39373	39433	39370	39370	Breaker	68	“ That a girl with so little self - worth spreads lies to grab attention . Our lawyers are handling it . There will be an apology once we present the required evidence of the former employee ’s inappropriate behavior in the workplace . Then again , I should n’t be saying anything because of how confidential it is . ”
39434	39439	39499	39499	she	733	“ Ah , understandable . ”
39440	39454	39455	39455	She	733	“ But thank you for your concern . I ’m doing quite fine . ”
39467	39484	39485	39485	She	733	“ Now , I believe we have a church to view and a priest to meet . ”
39530	39540	39520	39520	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry she brought that up . ”
39541	39571	39520	39520	I	0	“ Do n’t apologize for her . She ’s disgustingly transparent . I knew she was going to bring up the lawsuit , and shutting her down was easy . ”
39572	39586	39499	39499	she	733	“ I know , but still , she should n’t have said anything . ”
39587	39594	39520	39520	I	0	“ Lia , I ’m fine . ”
39595	39598	39599	39599	I	0	“ Okay . ”
39604	39630	39599	39599	I	0	“ I ’m going to need your help making our way up these stairs . These shoes Brian bought me are a touch too big . ”
39641	39652	39631	39631	Breaker	68	“ I was wondering where the hell you got those . ”
39653	39660	39661	39661	I	0	“ You do n’t like them ? ”
39725	39734	39722	39723	Brian Beaver	100	“ They ’re nice , just not you . ”
39735	39766	39798	39798	Breaker	68	“ What makes you think that ? The gold buckle on the toe or the fact that I look like I ’m a newbie trying to walk on circus stilts ? ”
39767	39774	39775	39775	He	68	“ Maybe a touch of both . ”
39778	39791	39775	39775	He	68	“ Well , at least The Beave did n’t say anything disapproving . ”
39805	39825	39798	39798	Breaker	68	“ Way to find the positive . Now , let ’s just focus on whether we like this church . ”
39826	39834	39775	39775	He	68	“ I ’m going to say no . ”
39835	39853	39854	39854	Breaker	68	“ Do you have a second venue where you want to get married ? A counter offer ? ”
39865	39882	39854	39854	Breaker	68	“ I do , actually , but I know The Beave is going to hate it . ”
39883	39891	39892	39892	Breaker	68	“ Then that means it ’s perfect , ”
39984	39997	39981	39981	I	0	“ I ’m surprised the lit candles are n’t a fire hazard . ”
39998	40008	39981	39981	I	0	“ And those candleholders do n’t look too sturdy . ”
40009	40016	40017	40018	The Beave	111	“ Is n’t it just divine ? ”
40023	40055	40017	40018	The Beave	111	“ We wo n’t be able to fit everyone into the pews , but we will live - stream the wedding to those waiting at the club for you to arrive . ”
40069	40079	40080	40080	I	0	“ How many people do you plan on inviting ? ”
40083	40093	40094	40094	She	111	“ Ophelia , I emailed you the guest list . ”
40124	40133	40110	40111	The Beave	111	“ Now , let ’s see this on . ”
40134	40142	40143	40144	The Beave	111	“ Hold on , what guest list ? ”
40173	40192	40193	40193	She	111	“ I sent it to you , Ophelia . Honestly , do we need to talk about organization ? ”
40231	40248	40224	40224	she	111	“ I guess I did n’t see it . I was sort of busy this weekend . ”
40256	40286	40287	40287	She	111	“ Well , if you took the time to worry about the upcoming nuptials , you would have seen I have a little over two thousand invites going out . ”
40293	40311	40287	40287	She	111	“ Now , please , walk down the aisle so I can see how this veil looks . ”
40324	40332	40333	40333	I	0	“ Two . . . two thousand ? ”
40341	40347	40333	40333	I	0	“ Like two thousand people ? ”
40348	40361	40362	40362	She	111	“ More like four to five . There are couples and families . ”
40375	40380	40381	40381	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
40390	40411	40381	40381	I	0	“ That ’s . . . that ’s too many people . Can the club even hold that many people ? ”
40412	40417	40418	40418	she	111	“ Of course not , ”
40427	40466	40467	40467	She	111	“ That ’s why we have secured the private beach as well . It ’s all about appearances , even if people wo n’t be able to see everything . Now , if you ’ll please . . . ”
40488	40494	40495	40495	I	0	“ Did you hear that ? ”
40509	40516	40495	40495	I	0	“ Two thousand people , Breaker . ”
40524	40531	40532	40532	Breaker	68	“ That seems like a lot , ”
40535	40543	40532	40532	Breaker	68	“ Has Brian gone over the list ? ”
40552	40565	40549	40549	her	111	“ Brian has better things to do than bother with wedding details . ”
40566	40590	40591	40591	Breaker	68	“ But . . . it ’s the start of his marriage . Do n’t you think he should be a little interested ? ”
40600	40663	40594	40594	Her	111	“ He ’s interested enough , but a guest list is menial . You should know the importance of his high - level job . I ca n’t be bothering him with these questions . That ’s why I ’m in charge . Now , Ophelia , walk down the aisle so I can see if the veil is right for you . ”
40664	40678	40679	40679	Breaker	68	“ Yeah , but that ’s a lot of people , Mrs. Beaver , ”
40713	40742	40698	40699	the assistant	747	“ Lia does n’t do well in big crowds . Unless you want a bride passing out at the altar , I think you need to pare down . ”
40751	40760	40743	40744	The Beave	111	“ That ’s not true , is it ? ”
40779	40785	40786	40786	I	0	“ I have weak knees , ”
40796	40804	40786	40786	I	0	“ Where did this veil come from ? ”
40805	40830	40743	40744	The Beave	111	“ It was mine from when I married . Please do n’t kick at it with your hooves . It ’s a precious heirloom . ”
40831	40836	40837	40837	I	0	“ Oh . . . ”
40840	40852	40837	40837	I	0	“ It ’s lovely . You can really smell the history . ”
40859	40893	40837	40837	I	0	“ Anywho , ca n’t say that a passed - out bride at the altar will result in cherished wedding memories . If I pass out , it ’s going to embarrass Brian . ”
40918	40932	40933	40933	She	111	“ I was n’t aware that you ’re a risk at the altar . ”
40939	40952	40933	40933	She	111	“ If you pass out , that would ruin the entire ceremony . ”
40960	40976	40977	40977	I	0	“ Yeah , and what if I hit my head on one of the pews ? ”
40980	41032	40977	40977	I	0	“ A cracked head leads to blood , and I do n’t think guests will want it to be a gory wedding . Especially if I wear this heirloom veil . Not sure blood comes out easily from fabric like this . Perchance , do you know the length of it ? ”
41033	41037	41038	41039	The Beave	111	“ Fifty feet , ”
41068	41100	41065	41065	Breaker	68	“ White dress , blood , and gore does n’t really say high - class wedding . Not to mention , she bleeds easily . We ’re talking pools of blood . ”
41101	41106	41107	41107	I	0	“ Iron deficiency anemia , ”
41114	41117	41111	41111	my	0	“ Well . ”
41125	41153	41118	41119	The Beave	111	“ Perhaps I ’ll speak with my doctor and get him to prescribe you some Xanax for the day to avoid any way of you passing out . ”
41163	41171	41172	41172	I	0	“ Uh , that wo n’t work , ”
41184	41187	41188	41188	he	68	“ Yeah , ”
41197	41217	41188	41188	he	68	“ That wo n’t work because . . . uh . . . well , she ’s a puker . ”
41235	41239	41240	41240	she	111	“ Pardon me ? ”
41250	41259	41260	41260	He	68	“ Yup , a serious puker this one . ”
41267	41412	41413	41413	Breaker	68	“ Any sort of medication that curbs her anxiety , she just pukes right up . And not just a little . It ’s projectile . I remember a time in college when she took some calming meds — can’t quite remember what it was — but she took some before her final exam in data statistics and mechanics because she was so nervous . After the first ten minutes of dry heaving , she started throwing up all over her exam and the poor girl in front of her . It was a disaster . Since then , she ’s stayed as far away from the medication as she can . I do n’t think risking Xanax on the day is worth it , so I believe we should just cut down the guest list . How about you send it to me , ”
41416	41451	41413	41413	Breaker	68	“ Since I ’m so immersed in who to rub elbows with , I ’ll be able to pick who will be insulted and who does n’t matter when it comes to being there . ”
41534	41537	41538	41539	The Beave	111	“ Oh , ”
41550	41559	41538	41539	The Beave	111	“ You ’re attuned to the social ladder ? ”
41560	41573	41574	41574	Breaker	68	“ Of course . How do you think I became a billionaire ? ”
41655	41674	41675	41676	The Beave	111	“ Well , that would be lovely then . I will take you up on your generous offer , ”
41703	41712	41700	41700	I	0	“ Dropping the billionaire title just like that ? ”
41721	41746	41716	41716	his	68	“ Got her to send me the list , did n’t it ? We can look it over together . Bring your red pen . ”
41747	41780	41781	41782	The Beave	111	“ I ’ll bring multiple . There will be a slashing . The gore might not happen at the wedding , but it sure as hell will happen over the guest list . ”
41790	41799	41785	41785	her	111	“ Now , are you Catholic , Ophelia ? ”
41800	41809	41785	41785	her	111	“ Uh , that would be a no . ”
41830	41839	41825	41825	Beave	111	“ I believe Brian told me you were . ”
41845	41863	41825	41825	Beave	111	“ Nope , not a Catholic . I actually do n’t really have a religion at all . ”
41864	41873	41874	41874	she	111	“ How could you not have a religion ? ”
41879	41897	41874	41874	she	111	“ Who on earth do you thank for everything in your life before you go to bed ? ”
41898	41906	41907	41907	I	0	“ Uh . . . my parents ? ”
41913	41922	41923	41923	She	111	“ Well , that just wo n’t do . ”
41933	41936	41925	41925	her	111	“ Phone . ”
41992	42033	42034	42034	She	111	“ Father Joseph , yes , it ’s Mrs. Beaver , how are you ? Good . I have a slight problem . Brian ’s fiancée just informed me she ’s not Catholic . Yes , I know . . . ”
42037	42055	42034	42034	She	111	“ Uh - huh . Well , what if I offer a large donation to the parish ? ”
42063	42069	42056	42056	Her	111	“ Yes , very large . ”
42105	42113	42114	42114	She	111	“ That ’s great . Thank you . ”
42126	42138	42114	42114	She	111	“ Problem diverted . Father Joseph will take care of it . ”
42139	42145	42146	42146	I	0	“ What does that mean ? ”
42149	42168	42146	42146	I	0	“ Best not ask questions , Ophelia . You ’ve already done enough with your lack of faith . ”
42174	42188	42189	42189	Breaker	68	“ Do n’t Brian and Lia have to take pre - cana classes ? ”
42192	42207	42189	42189	Breaker	68	“ And does n’t that require to be done six months before the wedding ? ”
42208	42236	42247	42247	She	111	“ Like I said , best we do not probe with questions . What needs to be done will be done , so let ’s drop it . ”
42253	42349	42247	42247	She	111	“ Now , if you would please walk down the aisle so I can see how the veil looks in this space . We have asked for the walls to be re - painted before the wedding a bright white as well as the carpet to be replaced since it ’s quite dingy , but this is the example of opulence we expect when it comes to wedding pictures . Of course , your dress will have a minimum of a twelve - foot train so it can descend the stairs along with the veil . ”
42361	42365	42366	42366	I	0	“ Twelve feet ? ”
42369	42378	42366	42366	I	0	“ That seems like a lot of fabric . ”
42379	42385	42386	42386	She	111	“ Lovely observation , dear . ”
42411	42434	42405	42405	She	111	“ Did Brian talk to you about laser eye surgery ? We ca n’t have you wearing glasses on the wedding day . ”
42446	42450	42405	42405	She	111	“ Why not ? ”
42451	42525	42526	42526	She	765	“ Glasses glare in pictures . Do you really think I want pictures of my son marrying a woman who looks like she has one eye because of the glare ? No . Plus , he does n’t care for your glasses anyway . He called them childish . I believe he was going to talk to you about Lasik surgery . I have a doctor who can get you in this week . ”
42532	42545	42528	42528	her	765	“ Book an appointment for Ophelia to go visit with Dr. Rosenblad . ”
42546	42559	42560	42560	I	0	“ I do n’t want Lasik surgery . It freaks me out , ”
42563	42564	42560	42560	I	0	“ Ophelia”—The
42570	42593	42594	42594	She	765	glare—“there is a time and a place to act like a child or act like an adult . Please remember your age . ”
42683	42686	42687	42687	Breaker	68	“ Hey , ”
42719	42726	42727	42727	he	68	“ Your glasses are fucking awesome , ”
42738	42761	42731	42731	his	68	“ Besides your heart , your honesty , and your sauciness , your glasses are one of my favorite things about you . ”
42762	42765	42766	42766	I	0	“ Breaker . ”
42782	42838	42773	42773	he	68	“ Not only are they a direct depiction of your personality , but they make the beautiful , light green flecks in your eyes stand out even more . It ’s already sometimes impossible to look away from them , but when they ’re highlighted so exquisitely , you ca n’t help but be captivated . ”
42853	42859	42860	42860	I	0	“ I ’m so embarrassed , ”
42863	42896	42860	42860	I	0	“ The only people in this scenario who should be embarrassed are The Beave for saying such a demeaning thing to you and Brian for even thinking that your glasses are unflattering . ”
42908	42924	42904	42904	he	68	“ You ’re gorgeous , Lia . The glasses accentuate just how gorgeous you are . ”
42925	42931	42932	42932	I	0	“ Th - Thank you , ”
43087	43097	43098	43098	he	68	“ Uh , I ’m going to grab this , ”
43102	43106	43098	43098	he	68	“ Excuse me . ”
43136	43143	43116	43116	he	68	“ Uh , hey , Birdy . ”
43151	43163	43164	43164	He	68	“ No , it ’s okay . What ’s going on ? ”
43172	43185	43164	43164	He	68	“ No , I do n’t think I have any plans tonight . ”
43213	43240	43241	43241	He	68	“ Yeah , sure , sounds fun . I ’ll meet you there . Text me the info . Yup , see you then . Bye . ”
43253	43258	43241	43241	He	68	“ Sorry about that . ”
43259	43264	43265	43265	I	0	“ Seeing Birdy tonight ? ”
43278	43283	43284	43284	he	68	“ Seems like it , ”
43295	43307	43284	43284	he	68	“ Shall we blow The Beave over with your ceremony suggestion ? ”
43308	43311	43312	43312	I	0	“ Sure , ”
43325	43333	43334	43334	He	68	“ And what would that suggestion be ? ”
43344	43352	43337	43337	his	68	“ Hold on , let me guess . ”
43360	43384	43355	43355	his	68	“ Uh , it has to be somewhere unique because that ’s who you are , but also something quaint and old school . ”
43390	43395	43387	43387	his	68	“ The old courthouse . ”
43396	43414	43337	43337	his	68	“ I would love that , but you know it ca n’t even fit one hundred people . ”
43415	43427	43428	43428	He	68	“ Good thing we ’re paring down the guest list then . ”
43433	43471	43430	43430	his	68	“ There ’s no way she would go for that , and if I ’m going to suggest something , I might as well suggest something that would make her think that she came up with it . ”
43472	43479	43480	43480	he	68	“ Okay , I ’m listening , ”
43505	43524	43501	43502	The Beave	111	“ You ’re not done with that , Ophelia . I ’m still processing how it will look . ”
43541	43593	43594	43594	He	68	“ Well , as much as I hate the club for obvious reasons , they have a beautiful garden out back that would be perfect for the ceremony . People could watch from the balcony of the club , from the lawn , or from chairs in front of the altar . ”
43597	43615	43594	43594	He	68	“ It ’s not exactly you , but just you enough . Want me to suggest it ? ”
43616	43637	43678	43678	Breaker	68	“ I hate to say it would be better coming from you , but I think that ’s the truth . ”
43638	43648	43649	43649	He	68	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ve got this . ”
43709	43713	43714	43714	he	68	“ Mrs. Beaver , ”
43718	43721	43722	43722	She	776	“ Yes ? ”
43732	43750	43751	43751	Breaker	68	“ You know , I was thinking , the reception will be at the club , right ? ”
43778	43783	43784	43784	she	776	“ That ’s correct , ”
43792	43817	43784	43784	she	776	“ Beautiful choice , by the way . I went there for a wedding a year or so ago , and it was breathtaking . ”
43913	43918	43919	43920	The Beave	111	“ It is picturesque . ”
43938	43989	43927	43927	her	111	“ And because it ’s so picturesque , it makes me think , although this church is beautiful , it pales in comparison to what the club has to offer . I was just there the other day , having a meeting with Clinton Mars . Do you know him ? ”
44079	44105	44110	44110	her	111	“ Yes , of course . Clinton is a wonderfully sharp and intelligent man . I was lucky to meet him a few months ago , ”
44114	44161	44106	44107	The Beave	111	“ Well , we took a stroll through the gardens during our meeting , and he raved about how it was so beautiful and what a perfect setting it would be for a wedding . He was actually thinking about having his daughter get married there . ”
44162	44165	44166	44166	she	111	“ Really ? ”
44178	44184	44174	44174	You	785	“ Keeping up with the Joneses ”
44196	44226	44188	44189	The Beave	111	“ Yup , and I thought . . . he was right . The gardens are breathtaking , beautifully landscaped with the ocean in the background , just spectacular . ”
44234	44249	44250	44250	She	111	“ You know , the flowers will be in full bloom in five weeks . ”
44263	44279	44280	44280	She	111	“ Get the club on the phone at once . I need to make arrangements . ”
44286	44308	44280	44280	She	111	“ Now the gardens would be magnificent , but I worry about your ability to walk in heels in the grass . ”
44309	44320	44321	44321	I	0	“ Oh , do n’t worry about it at all , ”
44337	44345	44321	44321	I	0	“ I ’m quite astute with heels . ”
44346	44350	44351	44351	Breaker	68	“ Very astute , ”
44354	44359	44360	44360	I	0	“ The most astute , ”
44379	44396	44369	44370	The Beave	111	“ Uh . . . just watch . I ’ll strut up and down this carpet . ”
44458	44462	44467	44467	her	111	“ Walk back , ”
44565	44568	44569	44569	I	0	“ See , ”
44581	44589	44572	44572	I	0	“ Not a problem at . . . ”
44609	44613	44614	44614	I	0	“ Oh shit , ”
44638	44643	44644	44644	I	0	“ Whoa , buddy , ”
44651	44658	44644	44644	I	0	“ That was a close one . ”
44676	44681	44685	44685	he	68	“ Uh , Lia , ”
44757	44762	44763	44763	I	0	“ Oh my God ! ”
44766	44781	44763	44763	I	0	“ Oh my God , I ’m on fire . I ’m on FIRE ! ”
44820	44824	44825	44826	The Beave	111	“ The veil ! ”
44829	44835	44825	44826	The Beave	111	“ You ’re on fire , ”
44839	44852	44853	44853	I	0	“ Put it out , put it out , put it out , ”
44856	44860	44861	44861	Breaker	68	“ Jesus Christ , ”
44864	44871	44861	44861	Breaker	68	“ Roll , Lia , roll ! ”
44872	44876	44877	44877	I	0	“ Roll where ? ”
44897	44925	44881	44881	I	0	“ Dear Jesus , do n’t set my hair on fire . Please , for the love of your father , do n’t set it on fire . ”
44926	44930	44931	44932	The Beave	111	“ An heirloom , ”
44942	44950	44931	44932	The Beave	111	“ Roll , for fuck ’s sake ! ”
44973	44978	44979	44979	I	0	“ Is it out ? ”
44982	44988	44979	44979	I	0	“ Am I still burning ? ”
45002	45023	44989	44989	I	0	“ Ahhhhh ! Breaker , it ’s coming to get me . Save my soul . . . save it ! ”
45037	45052	45053	45053	Splash	143	“ What ’s that smell ? Is that my hair ? Breaker , help — ”
45096	45106	45107	45107	He	68	“ Is it . . . is it out ? ”
45113	45120	45107	45107	He	68	“ Yeah , it ’s out . ”
45140	45148	45133	45133	I	0	“ Where did you get the water ? ”
45159	45175	45149	45149	He	68	“ Uh . . . I believe I just blessed you hard with holy water . ”
45181	45193	45194	45194	I	0	“ Baptism by fire just took on a whole new meaning , ”
45214	45219	45210	45210	I	0	“ Consider me converted . ”
45223	45228	45229	45229	I	0	“ She hates me , ”
45309	45318	45306	45306	he	68	“ I think hate is a strong word . ”
45319	45331	45306	45306	he	68	“ Breaker , I set her precious heirloom veil on fire . ”
45332	45358	45306	45306	he	68	“ Not on purpose . I think that ’s something we need to stress . You did not set the veil on fire on purpose . ”
45359	45369	45370	45370	I	0	“ I ’m sure she sees it that way . ”
45402	45425	45426	45426	Breaker	68	“ How do I even approach her ? Do I apologize again ? Do I just leave the decisions up to her ? ”
45435	45489	45426	45426	Breaker	68	“ It was an accident . Was it embarrassing ? Yes , but it was an accident . She will respect you more if you head to this next meeting with your head held high and not constantly apologizing . You said what you needed to say , so move on . Okay ? ”
45493	45505	45426	45426	Breaker	68	“ You ’re right . Just . . . move on . ”
45506	45512	45513	45513	He	68	“ That ’s the spirit . ”
45544	45575	45538	45538	she	111	“ Ophelia , I was n’t sure you would show up , given your appearance when we left the church , but it seems like you can clean up appropriately . ”
45585	45591	45582	45582	I	0	“ Was n’t too difficult . ”
45637	45645	45628	45628	She	111	“ So what are we looking at ? ”
45646	45652	45653	45654	The Beave	111	“ Paper density and weight , ”
45657	45669	45653	45654	The Beave	111	“ Really , it ’s not necessary that you ’re here . ”
45670	45674	45675	45675	I	0	“ It is , ”
45695	45711	45687	45687	Breaker	68	“ These are my wedding invites , after all . Plus , paper is fun . ”
45728	45738	45712	45712	I	0	“ Do you know what I love about paper ? ”
45739	45760	45761	45762	The Beave	111	“ I ’m sure you have some well - thought - out opinion that I ca n’t wait to hear , ”
45806	45812	45813	45813	I	0	“ I do , actually , ”
45816	45822	45813	45813	I	0	“ Paper is a journey — ”
45823	45838	45839	45839	Breaker	68	“ Uh , Lia , I need to speak to you for a second , ”
45853	45856	45845	45845	I	0	“ What ? ”
45857	45865	45866	45866	His	68	“ I need to talk to you . ”
45871	45874	45866	45866	His	68	“ Now . ”
45913	45919	45920	45920	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
45923	45936	45920	45920	I	0	“ Just saving you before you make yourself look like a fool . ”
45937	45943	45891	45891	Breaker	68	“ What do you mean ? ”
45944	45950	45951	45951	he	68	“ Paper is a journey ? ”
45954	45963	45951	45951	he	68	“ Where exactly were you going with that ? ”
45964	46000	45891	45891	Breaker	68	“ Well , if you let me finish , you would have seen that I was going pretty far with it . I had an entire diatribe about how it opens humans to new worlds . ”
46001	46040	46041	46041	I	0	“ Yeah , let ’s keep the philosophical talk to a minimum . The Beave is not going to want to hear it . She ’s on edge . Just keep the talking to a minimum . Okay ? ”
46073	46091	46069	46069	he	68	“ Okay , yeah . Maybe she does n’t want to know how paper is a journey . ”
46092	46110	46111	46111	He	68	“ I can bet my balls on the fact that she does n’t want to hear it . ”
46116	46138	46111	46111	He	68	“ Deep breaths . Do n’t ramble for no reason . It shows weakness . Pick out an invite with confidence . ”
46139	46145	46146	46146	I	0	“ I can do that . ”
46149	46152	46146	46146	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
46153	46158	46159	46159	We	802	“ You ’re welcome . ”
46194	46198	46187	46188	The Beave	2289	“ Everything okay ? ”
46199	46208	46209	46209	I	0	“ Yes , quite good . Thank you . ”
46226	46240	46223	46223	I	0	“ Funny how paper is made , right ? I watched this documentary — ”
46252	46258	46241	46241	Breaker	68	“ Lia , another word . ”
46273	46280	46270	46270	I	0	“ What did I do now ? ”
46281	46288	46289	46289	he	68	“ How about we try this , ”
46299	46307	46289	46289	he	68	“ You do n’t talk at all . ”
46308	46318	46270	46270	I	0	“ So just sit there in silence with her ? ”
46319	46322	46270	46270	I	0	“ Yes . ”
46323	46349	46289	46289	he	68	“ You know I ca n’t do that . I do n’t like silence . I can hear people breathing . It makes me uncomfortable . ”
46350	46383	46270	46270	I	0	“ I know , but your chatting wo n’t do anything to this situation besides make it worse . So just focus on picking an invite and try not to say much . ”
46384	46390	46270	46270	I	0	“ That seems so cold . ”
46391	46398	46399	46399	Breaker	68	“ This is a cold situation , ”
46402	46460	46399	46399	Breaker	68	“ After you burned her heirloom veil in effigy , this is no longer a lovey - dovey time . This is war , and if you do n’t want to be pushed around , you ’re going to have to hold your head high , shut the fuck up , and pick out what you want . ”
46470	46515	46467	46467	he	68	“ You know how you are so perplexed by the way Huxley can not say a word but get everything he wants ? It ’s because he ’s silent , and people buckle under the silence . Do n’t buckle . Make her buckle . ”
46516	46529	46467	46467	he	68	“ You ’re right . Be like Huxley , make her buckle . ”
46530	46541	46542	46542	I	0	“ Precisely . Okay , ready to go back there ? ”
46545	46561	46542	46542	I	0	“ And no talk about paper journeys and the mechanics of how it ’s made . ”
46562	46568	46569	46569	I	0	“ My lips are sealed , ”
46572	46575	46569	46569	I	0	“ Good . ”
46595	46612	46613	46613	he	68	“ Excuse me , I have to use the restroom . I ’ll be right back , ”
46725	46738	46720	46720	I	0	“ Do you happen to have anything that is n’t as fancy ? ”
46739	46743	46744	46745	The Beave	111	“ Excuse me ? ”
46748	46757	46744	46745	The Beave	111	“ What do you mean not so fancy ? ”
46798	46807	46796	46796	her	111	“ Ophelia , I asked you a question . ”
47094	47106	47087	47087	I	0	“ Paper was invented by the Chinese back in 100 BC , ”
47117	47262	47263	47263	I	0	“ And now , one single pine tree can create over eighty thousand sheets of paper . Can you believe that ? Wow , what a dedication to the journey of paper , which is of course , quite the tale in and of itself , but I wo n’t bore you with that other than to say that paper really can transport us from world to world , and sure , some people might say it ’s the author who is transporting us , the words are just on the paper , but you ca n’t print words without paper . Although I guess you can read electronically , ehh . . . either way , I think paper is a journey , and do n’t you think we should appreciate that journey ? I mean , look at this piece of paper , ”
47273	47371	47263	47263	I	0	“ Where do you think it came from ? What part of the world did this traverse ? For all we know , this used to be part of a tree that once housed a sloth or maybe a gibbon . And to know that it was a house at one point and is not going to offer its — for lack of a better term — body to us so we can invite people to the start of a new journey in life . . . do you see the full circle here ? Just marvelous . ”
47386	47392	47372	47372	I	0	“ All marvel — ouch . ”
47402	47421	47393	47393	I	0	“ The paper did n’t like me stroking it like that . Bit me right on the finger . ”
47471	47481	47482	47482	I	0	“ Dear God , I ’ve done it now , ”
47493	47498	47499	47499	Breaker	68	“ What the hell ? ”
47514	47525	47526	47526	He	68	“ Jesus , Lia . Can we get some tissues ? ”
47545	47549	47550	47550	he	68	“ What happened ? ”
47561	47565	47553	47553	I	0	“ I buckled . ”
47569	47575	47576	47576	Breaker	68	“ How are you feeling ? ”
47588	47597	47598	47598	I	0	“ How do you think I ’m feeling ? ”
47608	47627	47598	47598	I	0	“ Besides embarrassed , humiliated , and regretful , I want to know how you ’re doing physically . ”
47628	47631	47632	47632	I	0	“ Fine . ”
47641	47653	47632	47632	I	0	“ Do you think she already called him and told him ? ”
47654	47660	47661	47661	Breaker	68	“ Ca n’t be sure , ”
47664	47687	47661	47661	Breaker	68	“ But from the way she wiped your blood off her face with vehement swipes , I ’m going to say yes . ”
47688	47705	47632	47632	I	0	“ Then it ’s official . I ca n’t show my face near her ever again . ”
47706	47726	47727	47727	I	0	“ You ’re going to have to , and do n’t worry , I will be there with you . ”
47732	47747	47727	47727	I	0	“ I should just go back to my apartment , drown in my sorrows . ”
47748	47757	47758	47758	Breaker	68	“ Is that what you want to do ? ”
47774	47784	47761	47761	I	0	“ No . I want to talk to Brian . ”
47785	47797	47798	47798	Breaker	68	“ Then I think you need to go talk to him . ”
47805	47814	47798	47798	Breaker	68	“ I can go up there with you . ”
47815	47825	47826	47826	I	0	“ No , that would be a bad idea . ”
47836	47847	47826	47826	I	0	“ I can and should do this on my own . ”
47854	47872	47848	47848	I	0	“ Thank you for everything today , despite you leaving to pee at the worst time ever . ”
47873	47894	47852	47852	Breaker	68	“ I ’ve already noted that I ’m to pee before I ever leave you alone with The Beave again . ”
47895	47898	47899	47899	I	0	“ Good . ”
47908	47915	47899	47899	I	0	“ I ’ll see you later . ”
47916	47920	47852	47852	Breaker	68	“ Good luck . ”
48075	48087	48088	48088	Brian	100	“ Hello , Miss Fairweather - Fern , how are you ? ”
48099	48110	48092	48092	Beverly	146	“ I ’m good , how are you , Beverly ? ”
48111	48128	48129	48129	I	0	“ Just lovely . Congratulations on the engagement . Brian has been talking nonstop about it . ”
48133	48142	48129	48129	I	0	“ Thank you . We ’re very excited . ”
48167	48190	48200	48200	Beverly	146	“ Uh , is Brian available ? I know I came unannounced , but I hoped I could talk for a moment . ”
48191	48199	48200	48200	Beverly	146	“ He always wants to see you , ”
48203	48218	48200	48200	Beverly	146	“ I believe he ’s just working right now , not on the phone . ”
48219	48225	48226	48226	I	0	“ Okay , thank you . ”
48377	48380	48381	48381	he	820	“ Lia , ”
48387	48393	48394	48394	He	820	“ What a great surprise . ”
48486	48495	48496	48496	he	820	“ I ’m so glad you ’re here , ”
48559	48576	48577	48577	He	820	“ Okay , things are going to get out of hand if I keep kissing you . ”
48587	48599	48581	48581	his	820	“ Why am I so lucky to see you this afternoon ? ”
48647	48656	48639	48639	I	0	“ Have you spoken to your mom yet ? ”
48657	48674	48696	48696	his	820	“ No , I ’ve been busy . She ’s called twice , though . Why ? ”
48675	48691	48692	48692	He	820	“ Uh , I went to look at the church with your mom this morning . ”
48714	48723	48700	48700	he	820	“ How was it ? Beautiful , right ? ”
48724	48727	48728	48728	I	0	“ Very , ”
48731	48746	48728	48728	I	0	“ But I think we might change it to the gardens at the club . ”
48747	48762	48763	48763	He	820	“ Oh wow , that would be . . . that would be perfect . ”
48778	48783	48773	48774	his mother	442	“ I think so . ”
48827	48839	48817	48817	I	0	“ But something happened when I was there at the church . ”
48840	48848	48849	48849	he	820	“ Okay . . . what happened ? ”
48853	48863	48849	48849	he	820	“ First of all , it was an accident . ”
48864	48874	48817	48817	I	0	“ Now you have me worried . What happened ? ”
48875	48971	48849	48849	he	820	“ Well , your mom made me try on her wedding veil because she wanted to see me walk down the aisle wearing it . I was wearing those shoes you got me that are a touch too big , and long story short , I slipped out of them when walking , tumbled into a lit candle , and it rolled off the holder and right onto the veil . It caught on fire , and the only reason I still have hair at this point is because Breaker doused me in holy water . ”
48998	49004	48995	48995	he	820	“ Are you being serious ? ”
49005	49018	48849	48849	he	820	“ Yes , I would n’t lie about this . Trust me . ”
49019	49030	48849	48849	he	820	“ So you set my mom ’s veil on fire ? ”
49031	49036	49037	49037	I	0	“ Not on purpose , ”
49041	49062	49037	49037	I	0	“ It was all an accident . And that , uh , that was n’t the only thing that happened . ”
49063	49077	48849	48849	he	820	“ What do you mean that ’s not the only thing that happened ? ”
49078	49145	48849	48849	he	820	“ Well , you see , after the church , I went and changed because the holy water soaked me , but we had another appointment to pick out invitations , and well , I got a paper cut while flipping through the paper , did n’t realize it , and ended up flicking my blood on your mom ’s face and all over the paper . ”
49146	49149	49150	49150	he	820	“ What ? ”
49160	49169	49150	49150	he	820	“ You flicked your blood at my mom ? ”
49179	49214	49170	49170	I	0	“ Once again , not on purpose . All a mistake , but I thought I should tell you because I ’m sure she called you to beg you to end things with me . ”
49227	49236	49220	49220	he	820	“ Lia , she would n’t do that . ”
49237	49248	49220	49220	he	820	“ I do n’t know . She was pretty upset . ”
49249	49272	49220	49220	he	820	“ She was probably upset , but she does like you . I ’m sure an apology is all that ’s needed . ”
49282	49286	49287	49287	he	820	“ Either way , ”
49290	49324	49287	49287	he	820	“ I ’m sure it ’s fine . Are you okay , though ? Almost setting your hair on fire and bleeding heavily does n’t sound like a fun day in wedding planning . ”
49325	49343	49378	49378	his	820	“ Yeah , pretty traumatic , but that was n’t the real reason I came over here . ”
49344	49349	49350	49350	he	820	“ It was n’t ? ”
49353	49372	49350	49350	he	820	“ Jesus , if that ’s not the reason , then I think I should mentally prepare myself . ”
49384	49389	49381	49381	I	0	“ Uh , probably . ”
49406	49432	49398	49398	I	0	“ So when we were at the church , before the fire , your mom said something to me that did n’t really settle well . ”
49433	49447	49448	49448	he	820	“ Whatever it was , I ’m sure she did n’t mean it , ”
49486	49521	49522	49522	Lovely	147	“ She ’s stressed with all the planning . I ’m positive she ’ll say a lot in the next coming weeks that wo n’t settle well . Do n’t take offense to it . ”
49530	49544	49545	49545	His	820	“ No , this was something you said . . . about me . ”
49558	49564	49550	49550	he	820	“ What did she say ? ”
49574	49600	49565	49565	I	0	“ Well , she said that you do n’t like my glasses and that they ’re childish , that I would be better without them . ”
49627	49640	49641	49641	I	0	“ Did you . . . did you say that to her ? ”
49651	49689	49644	49644	He	820	“ I did . She was talking about the wedding pictures and how your glasses might mess them up , and I said that maybe you ’d consider contacts since the purple glasses were kind of childish . ”
49690	49693	49694	49694	I	0	“ Oh , ”
49724	49738	49739	49739	My	0	“ Lia , I do n’t want you to take offense to that . ”
49744	49784	49739	49739	My	0	“ How could I not take offense to that , Brian ? I ’ve had these glasses forever . They ’re the ones my mom helped me pick out . They ’re special to me . They mean something . ”
49785	49798	49799	49799	he	835	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . I did n’t know that , ”
49802	49831	49799	49799	he	835	“ I just thought it was one of your . . . quirks . You know , like how you ironically wear shirts with characters from Harry Potter . ”
49832	49848	49739	49739	My	0	“ I do n’t wear those ironically . I wear them because I like them . ”
49849	49873	49874	49874	I	0	“ Well , either way , I did n’t realize there was any meaning behind the glasses . I ’m sorry , Lia . ”
49915	49918	49919	49919	He	835	“ Lia . ”
49925	49938	49919	49919	He	835	“ I said I ’m sorry . Please do n’t be mad . ”
49939	49945	49946	49946	I	0	“ I ’m not mad , ”
49955	49962	49946	49946	I	0	“ Just embarrassed , I guess . ”
49963	49984	49919	49919	He	835	“ There ’s no need to be embarrassed . I should never have said anything . That was really shitty . ”
49985	49995	49919	49919	He	835	“ Do you think they make me look ugly ? ”
49996	50001	50002	50002	he	835	“ No , Lia , ”
50006	50011	50002	50002	he	835	“ Not at all . ”
50012	50053	49919	49919	He	835	“ Do you think I would be more attractive to you without them ? Because that ’s how it feels , how the comment feels , like . . . like I ’m not pretty enough when I wear them . ”
50054	50098	50002	50002	he	835	“ Lia , that ’s not what I meant . I think glasses look great on you . They ’re just , they ’re purple is all , and I would have thought that maybe someone your age would want something more sophisticated . ”
50106	50114	50103	50103	I	0	“ So I ’m not sophisticated enough ? ”
50115	50118	50119	50119	he	835	“ No , ”
50127	50149	50103	50103	I	0	“ Fuck , I ’m not saying this right . Just . . . just forget I said anything at all . ”
50181	50192	50167	50167	I	0	“ Do you think I ’m good enough for you ? ”
50193	50196	50197	50197	His	835	“ What ? ”
50201	50213	50197	50197	His	835	“ Of course , Lia . Why would you think that ? ”
50255	50284	50167	50167	I	0	“ Because there are moments where you try to change me . Like when we go to meals with your mother , you buy me clothes to wear . ”
50285	50307	50167	50167	I	0	“ That ’s because she can be very particular , and I do n’t want her giving you a hard time . ”
50308	50340	50425	50425	his	839	“ Or the glasses , or when we ’re in public , it ’s like you have this standard I have to meet for me to be attached to your arm . ”
50341	50348	50167	50167	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
50349	50382	50167	50167	I	0	“ Just this past weekend , I said let ’s go get ice cream , and I was going to go out in my pajamas , but you told me to change . ”
50383	50407	50408	50408	He	839	“ Lia , I could see your nipples through your white tank top . Do you really think I want people seeing that ? ”
50413	50420	50408	50408	He	839	“ That ’s just for me . ”
50429	50447	50421	50421	I	0	“ I do n’t know , it just feels like I ’m not good enough for you . ”
50448	50453	50454	50454	He	839	“ Lia , stop . ”
50461	50501	50454	50454	He	839	“ Of course you ’re good enough . Why else would I propose to you ? Now I ’m sorry about the glasses . I never should have said that , but please do n’t let that unravel you . ”
50502	50520	50421	50421	I	0	“ I ’m not unraveling , Brian . I ’m just trying to make sure my boyfriend — ”
50521	50524	50525	50525	he	839	“ Fiancé , ”
50532	50555	50525	50525	he	839	“ Yes , my fiancé . I ’m just trying to make sure that he is marrying me for the right reasons . ”
50556	50589	50591	50591	his	839	“ What are you talking about ? Where is this coming from ? We had a great weekend , and now , all of a sudden , you ’re doubting me ? Does this”—he
50595	50608	50525	50525	he	839	mouth—“does this have to do with anything Breaker said to you today ? ”
50609	50616	50617	50617	I	0	“ Are you serious right now ? ”
50627	50668	50617	50617	I	0	“ Breaker was nothing but supportive , especially when your mother basically told me I was a bridge troll with glasses and that my opinion about my wedding did n’t matter . Do not blame any of this on Breaker . ”
50669	50676	50677	50677	He	839	“ Shit , you ’re right . ”
50690	50711	50677	50677	He	839	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m just wound up and apparently unable to stop myself from saying stupid things . ”
50717	50737	50677	50677	He	839	“ Okay , well , I think . . . I think I just need to take a breath . ”
50738	50741	50742	50742	he	839	“ No , ”
50751	50756	50742	50742	he	839	“ Do n’t leave . ”
50757	50766	50677	50677	He	839	“ I need some fresh air , Brian . ”
50767	50805	50806	50806	I	0	“ Then let ’s go on a walk . Let ’s go to the park across the street . Please , Lia . I feel like a dick , and I do n’t want you leaving mad . ”
50859	50862	50863	50863	I	0	“ Okay , ”
50961	50992	50953	50953	Brian	100	“ I ’m sorry you had a rough day today , and I ’m sorry this wedding stuff is so stressful . I know it ’s not easy on you . ”
50993	50998	50999	50999	I	0	“ It ’s not , ”
51002	51023	50953	50953	Brian	100	“ None of it has been easy . And if I were honest , I was n’t expecting a proposal . ”
51024	51029	51030	51030	he	839	“ You were n’t ? ”
51036	51075	51030	51030	he	839	“ Not even a little . I mean , come on , Brian , we never even talked about the possibility of getting married , so I was caught off guard when you got down on one knee . ”
51076	51093	50953	50953	Brian	100	“ But . . . we love each other . I mean , I love you . ”
51094	51139	50953	50953	Brian	100	“ And I love you , Brian . That ’s not the issue . I just . . . I do n’t know . I thought we ’d move in together , take that for a spin first before there was a ring involved . ”
51140	51177	51178	51178	He	850	“ We sort of live together , at least half of the time . You have a key to my place , a dresser . I just assumed that was n’t something we had to tackle . ”
51181	51190	51178	51178	He	850	“ Am I moving too fast for you ? ”
51339	51362	51331	51331	I	0	“ No , just . . . just stunned is all and still trying to wrap my head around all of it . ”
51366	51378	51363	51363	He	850	“ I ’m sure my mother ’s plans are n’t helping . ”
51379	51389	51390	51390	I	0	“ Yeah , she ’s going a touch fast . ”
51401	51415	51390	51390	I	0	“ She ’s been wanting me to propose to you for a bit . ”
51416	51419	51420	51420	I	0	“ Really ? ”
51425	51446	51420	51420	I	0	“ I would have guessed from our rather cold relationship that she would n’t want you to propose to me . ”
51447	51472	51473	51473	Brian	100	“ Mother might be cold and uninviting at times , maybe a touch harsh , but she also can see when I ’m happy . ”
51478	51490	51473	51473	Brian	100	“ And you make me happy , Lia . Very happy . ”
51496	51506	51491	51491	I	0	“ You make me happy , too , Brian . ”
51609	51623	51590	51590	his	68	“ She ’s been wanting me to propose to you for a bit . ”
52099	52116	52117	52117	Breaker	68	“ I want nothing to do with the process . Just put it in my mouth . ”
52386	52408	52409	52409	Birdy	118	“ I know this was kind of out of the blue , but thank you for agreeing to come with me , ”
52529	52534	52535	52535	I	0	“ Not a problem , ”
52550	52558	52559	52559	Birdy	118	“ Baking is not really my thing , ”
52570	52587	52562	52562	she	118	“ But Callie just got this job , and she really wants to impress her boss . ”
52588	52596	52597	52597	I	0	“ I would be the same way . ”
52614	52623	52603	52603	I	0	“ At least the theme is pretty cool . ”
52632	52637	52626	52626	her	118	“ Is that sarcasm ? ”
52680	52699	52673	52674	Pussycat Cupcakes	151	“ I like cats . I had one growing up named Jiggles . He was my best bud . ”
52700	52703	52704	52704	she	118	“ Really ? ”
52707	52713	52704	52704	she	118	“ You ’re being serious ? ”
52714	52717	52718	52718	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
52721	52766	52718	52718	I	0	“ I guess it would be hard to believe , but yeah , Jiggles and I were quite the pair . He would follow me around outside while I flew my model airplanes , and at night , he would cuddle on my pillow . ”
52767	52780	52704	52704	she	118	“ Aw , that ’s so sweet . What happened to him ? ”
52781	52802	52718	52718	I	0	“ Feline cancer . But he lived until he was eighteen , so he had a nice , full life . ”
52803	52826	52718	52718	I	0	“ Okay , so maybe I do n’t feel that bad about taking you to a cat - themed cupcake place then . ”
52827	52837	52838	52838	I	0	“ Oh no , you should still feel bad . ”
52933	52937	52938	52938	Birdy	118	“ Not bad . ”
53010	53017	53018	53018	She	118	“ Ooo , that ’s good . ”
53026	53033	53018	53018	She	118	“ What color should we do ? ”
53040	53063	53037	53037	I	0	“ Well , we could go with the proposed color , pink . Or we can be rebels and pick something else . ”
53064	53076	53077	53077	Her	118	“ A pink pussy . . . cat seems too generic . ”
53083	53096	53077	53077	Her	118	“ But blue . . . that ’s clearly not an option . ”
53097	53109	53110	53110	I	0	“ No one likes a blue pussy . . . cat , ”
53120	53139	53110	53110	I	0	“ Green makes me think ill . And a sick pussy is not something I want to eat . ”
53140	53144	53145	53145	I	0	“ Or lick , ”
53148	53151	53145	53145	I	0	“ Exactly . ”
53164	53180	53152	53152	She	118	“ What about red . . . uh , wait , I take that back . ”
53204	53229	53194	53194	She	118	“ Shhh , you ’re gathering attention . If we ’re straying from the pink pussy , we need to be stealthy about it . ”
53230	53238	53196	53196	her	118	“ Sorry , but definitely not red . ”
53239	53256	53196	53196	her	118	“ That was a terrible suggestion . How about orange or yellow ? Those feel right . ”
53257	53262	53263	53263	I	0	“ How about both ? ”
53266	53276	53277	53277	She	118	“ Now , I think you ’re onto something . ”
53285	53328	53277	53277	She	118	“ I think if we split the icing in half , color one orange and one yellow , and then put them in the frosting tube at the same time , then we will get some sort of tie - dye effect . ”
53339	53350	53329	53329	I	0	“ Uh , I thought you were n’t into baking . ”
53351	53384	53413	53413	her	118	“ I ’m not , but I do aimlessly scroll on Tik Tok . The algorithm has decided I like to watch baking videos . And secretly . . . I do . ”
53385	53409	53410	53410	She	118	“ It probably decided that because you watch the video in its entirety instead of swiping up . This knowledge is on you . ”
53416	53436	53413	53413	her	118	“ Guilty . But I do n’t watch for the education . I watch because I have a problem . ”
53437	53454	53455	53455	I	0	“ I can see that . You know , this makes me think of you differently . ”
53471	53488	53455	53455	I	0	“ I completely understand . If you want to leave , I wo n’t stop you . ”
53489	53521	53522	53522	She	118	“ You know , leaving would be the right thing to do in order to teach you a lesson , but I think I ’ll be the bigger man and stay . ”
53525	53545	53522	53522	She	118	“ Do n’t act like you ’re staying for me . You ’re just staying for the pussy cakes . ”
53580	53594	53595	53595	Birdy	118	“ Thank you for coming tonight , it meant a lot to Callie , ”
53604	53642	53643	53643	She	118	“ You know , I think I will say this once and only once because I do n’t want to give off the wrong impression about my likes and dislikes for baking , but I had fun . ”
53654	53664	53648	53648	she	118	“ Please , spare my feelings from the lies . ”
53665	53669	53670	53670	I	0	“ I did , ”
53677	53698	53699	53699	She	118	“ I had a lot of fun hanging out with you . Was n’t as awkward as the double date . ”
53711	53732	53699	53699	She	118	“ Yeah , double dates are always a treat , especially when one half of it is a blind date . ”
53763	53792	53793	53793	Her	118	“ So are we still on for a hike and birdwatching ? I did n’t deter you with the way I took down three cupcakes in one sitting ? ”
53798	53817	53818	53818	I	0	“ No , watching you munch on those pussies actually made me want to hang out even more . ”
53821	53838	53818	53818	I	0	“ You know , you could have shown this sense of humor on the double date . ”
53839	53894	53793	53793	Her	118	“ Oh my God , I would not be caught dead saying anything like that in front of Brian . He ’s so . . . stuck up , and my brother is just the same . Whenever I ’m around Brian , I know I have to keep it together . Act posh . ”
53895	53912	53793	53793	Her	118	“ Why would you want to act like someone else , not be your true you ? ”
53913	53947	53948	53948	I	0	“ Easier that way . I ’d rather spend a few hours with my pinky up , acting fancy , than answering to my brother why I said pussy in front of Brian . ”
53958	54000	53948	53948	I	0	“ Yeah , I can see not wanting to get into it with your brother . I often have that thought cross my mind . But even with a filter , my brothers and I seem to get into it somehow . ”
54001	54004	54005	54005	She	881	“ Same . ”
54008	54048	54005	54005	She	881	“ But to answer your question , yes , I still want to go hiking with you . And maybe , you know , if you have availability for dinner or something this week , I could be free . ”
54054	54105	54049	54049	She	881	“ That sounds so pathetic like I do n’t have a life , but who am I kidding ? I do n’t do much other than work out and go to work , so . . . if you are free , I ’m pretty sure I would be too . ”
54106	54110	54111	54111	I	0	“ Not pathetic , ”
54131	54139	54140	54140	I	0	“ Honest , and I like that . ”
54278	54284	54285	54285	I	0	“ I ’ll call you , ”
54313	54321	54322	54322	She	881	“ I ’m holding you to that . ”
54399	54424	54425	54425	I	0	“ So are you going to just ignore the fact that you went on a baking date and not tell me anything about it ? ”
54445	54463	54428	54428	I	0	“ Nothing to really say . It was n’t really baking , as it was frosting cupcakes . ”
54464	54469	54470	54470	Lia	168	“ And . . . ”
54499	54506	54507	54507	I	0	“ And I brought cupcakes home , ”
54518	54537	54507	54507	I	0	“ Uh - huh , so you ’re telling me that ’s all that happened ? Nothing else ? ”
54538	54561	54574	54574	her	168	“ I mean , we talked and laughed , and she was pretty fucking funny . But yeah , that was it . ”
54562	54570	54571	54571	Lia	168	“ Did you kiss her good night ? ”
54609	54626	54627	54627	She	168	“ Um , from your pause , I ’m going to assume that ’s a yes . ”
54634	54646	54627	54627	She	168	“ Breaker , why are n’t you telling me what happened ? ”
54647	54650	54651	54651	I	0	“ Because , ”
54659	54663	54664	54664	she	168	“ Because why ? ”
54667	54671	54672	54672	She	168	“ Just because . ”
54686	54707	54672	54672	She	168	“ That ’s not an answer . You tell me everything , so why are you being weird about this ? ”
54708	54714	54715	54715	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
54727	54753	54715	54715	I	0	“ Probably because it feels weird . Okay ? This whole dating thing feels weird . And I do n’t know how to handle it . ”
54754	54771	54672	54672	She	168	“ Well , not talking to me does n’t help . We tell each other everything . ”
54772	54776	54715	54715	I	0	“ I know . ”
54791	54807	54777	54777	I	0	“ Fuck , Lia , I kissed her last night because I really wanted to . ”
54816	54848	54849	54849	Lia	168	“ All night , she made me laugh , and she ’s beautiful , and at one point , she sucked on her finger , and it made me fucking sweat . ”
54852	54872	54873	54873	I	0	“ So when it came to saying good night , I wanted to kiss her , and I did . ”
54879	54903	54873	54873	I	0	“ And it was good . Sweet . Not too intense , just perfect . But I . . . I felt nothing . ”
54904	54907	54908	54908	she	168	“ Nothing ? ”
54916	54943	54911	54911	I	0	“ No , there was no spark , no desire to push her up against the SUV and further the kiss . It was just sweet . ”
54950	55011	54944	54944	I	0	“ I think there ’s something wrong with me . This is why I do n’t date because I never feel anything for anyone . Never . It ’s always just . . . average . And Birdy is not the type of girl I take home for the night and not see again . She ’s the dating type . ”
55012	55021	55022	55023	The Beave	111	“ Are you two done conversing over there ? ”
55031	55039	55028	55028	her	111	“ I have important things to discuss . ”
55047	55058	55040	55040	Lia	168	“ This conversation is n’t over . You hear me ? ”
55059	55069	55070	55070	I	0	“ Yeah , did n’t think it would be , ”
55081	55095	55096	55096	Lia	168	“ Ophelia , please do n’t drag your feet . It ’s unbecoming . ”
55127	55155	55110	55111	The Beave	111	“ Now , I just spoke with the florist and she said she can accommodate our order of red roses , but we need to act quickly . ”
55156	55160	55161	55161	Lia	168	“ Red roses ? ”
55164	55170	55161	55161	Lia	168	“ Those are so formal . ”
55188	55211	55185	55185	I	0	“ Exactly , this is a formal wedding , Ophelia . What do you expect to have at the wedding ? Daisies ? ”
55228	55235	55236	55236	Lia	168	“ As a matter of fact , ”
55239	55256	55236	55236	Lia	168	“ I was thinking daisies would be perfect . They were my mom ’s favorite flower . ”
55267	55299	55257	55258	The Beave	111	“ Ophelia , I appreciate your dedication to your mother ’s favorite flower . Very admirable , but this is a wedding , not a memorial . This is a celebration . ”
55350	55354	55355	55355	I	0	“ Mrs. Beaver , ”
55365	55414	55355	55355	I	0	“ I do n’t want to step on any toes here , but I believe it would be a kind and serving thing to honor Lia ’s late mother by including daisies . It would be a way to include her mother since she ca n’t be here . ”
55415	55426	55439	55440	the florist	883	“ But roses and daisies do n’t go well together . ”
55427	55438	55439	55440	the florist	883	“ I can include daisies in the bride ’s bouquet , ”
55443	55451	55452	55452	Lia	168	“ I do n’t need a bouquet , ”
55466	55490	55460	55460	her	111	“ What do you mean you do n’t need a bouquet ? What on earth would you possibly walk down the aisle with ? ”
55491	55521	55522	55523	The Beave	111	“ I made a bunch of knitted flowers with my mom and grandma . I ’ve saved them so I could make a bouquet out of them one day . ”
55567	55581	55562	55562	she	810	“ Knitted flowers ? For a wedding ? You ca n’t be serious . ”
55597	55615	55616	55616	I	0	“ I ’m pretty sure she ’s serious , or else she would n’t bring it up , ”
55639	55689	55626	55626	her	168	“ Mrs. Beaver , I appreciate your need to make this a beautiful wedding , but you need to remember that you ’re around to see your son get married , and my parents are n’t , so incorporating them into the ceremony and reception is important to me . ”
55690	55701	55702	55702	I	0	“ And it should be important to you as well , ”
55751	55773	55743	55743	She	111	“ Well , if we could find a suitable way to incorporate daisies without looking tacky , we would appreciate it . ”
55785	55791	55774	55775	The florist	883	“ I believe we can . ”
55792	55798	55799	55799	I	0	“ What a nice compromise , ”
55814	55825	55809	55809	I	0	“ I think daisies and roses will go well together . ”
55826	55831	55832	55832	Lia	168	“ Especially white roses , ”
55835	55847	55832	55832	Lia	168	“ Oh , come now , you ca n’t be serious , ”
55852	55883	55848	55849	The Beave	111	“ White roses ? You might not be getting married in a church , but for heaven ’s sake , white roses ? We ’re not lying to our guests . ”
55913	55923	55924	55924	Lia	168	“ Why would we be lying to the guests ? ”
55936	55975	55930	55930	her	111	“ Ophelia , I have turned a blind eye to your nighttime activities with my son , but not everyone is as forgiving . White roses symbolize purity , and I ’m afraid you ’re anything but pure . ”
55987	55995	55979	55979	Lia	168	“ I do n’t think that matters . ”
55996	56002	56003	56004	The Beave	111	“ Oh , it matters , ”
56007	56014	56015	56015	Lia	168	“ Okay , then maybe pink , ”
56018	56030	56015	56015	Lia	168	“ Does n’t that have to do with grace or something ? ”
56031	56036	56037	56038	the florist	883	“ Grace and sweetness , ”
56041	56048	56049	56049	Lia	168	“ That would be good then , ”
56072	56077	56078	56078	she	168	“ Oh my God , ”
56089	56097	56098	56099	The Beave	111	“ What on earth are you doing ? ”
56102	56108	56098	56099	The Beave	111	“ It was a bee . ”
56127	56133	56134	56134	she	168	“ Do n’t sting me , ”
56138	56171	56134	56134	she	168	“ For heaven ’s sake , it ’s just a bee . If you ca n’t handle that , how are you going to get married in the gardens at the club ? ”
56172	56186	56187	56187	Lia	168	“ As long as they don’t — booooother - her - her me , ”
56201	56215	56187	56187	Lia	168	“ It ’s dive - bombing me . It knows I ’m weak . ”
56216	56227	56263	56263	she	168	“ Ophelia , you ’re making a fool of yourself . ”
56228	56233	56234	56234	she	168	“ I ’m sorry , ”
56254	56259	56260	56260	Lia	168	“ Mother of God ! ”
56390	56399	56400	56401	The Beave	111	“ Get me out of here at once , ”
56457	56467	56468	56468	Lia	168	“ Oh my God , I ’m so sorry , ”
56511	56529	56493	56493	she	111	“ There will be red roses at the wedding with very minimal daisies . End of discussion . ”
56564	56576	56561	56561	Lia	168	“ That , uh . . . that was n’t ideal . ”
56592	56627	56583	56583	I	0	“ Who knew you would get to second base with your mother - in - law today ? What did it feel like ? In my head , they ’re just sacs of dust . ”
56634	56645	56628	56628	She	168	“ Is that what I ’m tasting ? Boob dust ? ”
56668	56690	56655	56655	I	0	“ Just be glad your arm did n’t fly low , or else you would have a mouthful of vagina dust . ”
56691	56705	56706	56706	she	168	“ Vagina dust . . . is n’t that just Old Bay seasoning ? ”
56714	56724	56706	56706	she	168	“ Oh fuck . . . I love you . ”
56728	56757	56758	56758	Lia	168	“ You know , I ’ve never seen someone ’s blood boil in real life . You always hear the idiom , but you never actually see it . ”
56784	56806	56758	56758	Lia	168	“ But wow , we witnessed The Beave ’s blood rippling through her ghastly veins today . It was something else . ”
56807	56819	56758	56758	Lia	168	“ If looks could kill , we ’d both be dead . ”
56820	56848	56758	56758	Lia	168	“ Dead on the spot . Did you catch the look the florist gave us ? I ’m pretty sure she wanted to shrivel up and disappear . ”
56849	56863	56758	56758	Lia	168	“ I think that ’s how everyone feels when The Beave is around . ”
56877	56889	56864	56864	Lia	168	“ Thanks for sticking up for me . I appreciate it . ”
56890	56909	56910	56910	Lia	168	“ You do n’t need to say thank you . That ’s what a Pickle of Honor does . ”
56917	56931	56910	56910	Lia	168	“ Do you think it ’s stupid to do the knitted flower thing ? ”
56937	56946	56934	56934	my	0	“ Makes me like you that much more . ”
56953	57022	56947	56947	Her	168	“ I think it ’s really sweet , and if I were in your shoes , I would want to do the same thing . This is an important day in a person ’s life , and it ’s only right to honor those who ca n’t be there . I think your mom would love it if you walked down the aisle with something you made together . ”
57023	57026	57027	57027	She	168	“ Agreed . ”
57033	57109	57027	57027	She	168	“ I keep thinking about the walk down the aisle and how my dad would have held me tightly , told me how much he loves me , how proud he is , and how he always dreamed of that day . The day he could give me away . And now . . . now I wo n’t have that . I ’ll have to make the walk alone , and that ’s daunting . ”
57110	57119	57120	57120	I	0	“ I ’ll walk you down the aisle , ”
57123	57135	57120	57120	I	0	“ You wo n’t be alone . You ’ll have me . ”
57136	57162	57027	57027	She	168	“ The Beave would never go for that , as you ’re supposed to go ahead of me since you ’re the Pickle of Honor . ”
57163	57184	57185	57185	She	905	“ By the way , if Pickle of Honor is n’t on the programs , I ’m going to rage . ”
57188	57235	57185	57185	She	905	“ But I do n’t care what The Beave wants . I want you to be happy , to feel like you ’re surrounded by the people who love you , and if that means I ’m double downing on responsibilities , then who fucking cares ? ”
57236	57310	57027	57027	She	168	“ Thank you . Ugh , I hate that this has all been so morose . I feel like when you get married , it should be this big celebration . So far , it ’s felt like a version of hell . The only reason I ’ve made it through these past two days is because of you . I ’m pretty sure I would have folded after the guest list number . ”
57311	57333	57027	57027	She	168	“ It will get better . Once all this planning is out of the way , it will be smooth sailing . ”
57334	57339	57340	57340	She	905	“ I hope so . ”
57349	57360	57340	57340	She	905	“ So you going to finish that conversation about Birdy ? ”
57361	57369	57370	57370	I	0	“ What else is there to say ? ”
57376	57439	57370	57370	I	0	“ I think I ’m going to give it another chance , just because she ’s cool and I had a good time with her . Maybe it was all the sugar I ate , but I told her I would take her hiking , so I ’m going to do that , and we ’ll see where it goes from there . ”
57440	57460	57340	57340	She	905	“ Why are you pushing it ? If you do n’t like her , you do n’t like her . ”
57461	57472	57473	57473	I	0	“ It ’s not that I do n’t like her , ”
57476	57525	57473	57473	I	0	“ I actually do . I just did n’t feel anything when I kissed her , and I expected more , you know ? Maybe I was nervous . She was tugging at my shirt , and that was hot , so maybe I got in my head . ”
57526	57534	57535	57535	Lia	168	“ She was tugging on your shirt ? ”
57545	57552	57535	57535	Lia	168	“ Like to take it off ? ”
57553	57590	57473	57473	I	0	“ No , like to keep me in place . I liked it . And her lips were super soft . I wonder if I open - mouth kissed her if that would have been better ? ”
57591	57601	57602	57602	Lia	168	“ You did n’t open - mouth kiss her ? ”
57605	57614	57602	57602	Lia	168	“ So it was just tight - lipped ? ”
57615	57622	57473	57473	I	0	“ Yeah , like a peck . ”
57623	57648	57473	57473	I	0	“ Well , that ’s probably why you did n’t feel anything . A peck does n’t give you much room to interpret attraction . ”
57649	57652	57653	57653	I	0	“ Huh . ”
57665	57674	57653	57653	I	0	“ You know , you might be right . ”
57675	57681	57473	57473	I	0	“ I know I am . ”
57682	57690	57473	57473	I	0	“ Do n’t be humble or anything . ”
57691	57702	57653	57653	I	0	“ When have we ever been humble around each other ? ”
57703	57706	57707	57707	I	0	“ Never , ”
57717	57724	57710	57710	I	0	“ What are you doing tonight ? ”
57725	57759	57653	57653	I	0	“ Headed over to Brian ’s . Things have been a little sticky lately between us , and he ’s feeling it , so he asked me over . He ’s making dinner . ”
57760	57770	57771	57771	She	907	“ Did you talk to him about the glasses ? ”
57781	57793	57773	57773	her	907	“ Yeah , he admitted to saying that to his mom . ”
57818	57864	57809	57809	I	0	“ But apologized . I do n’t know . I feel like this is when all the rotten things come out in a relationship . It ’s best it comes out now , right ? So you know you can work through all of it . ”
57865	57870	57908	57908	Huxley	92	“ Yeah , probably . ”
57892	57896	57890	57890	Huxley	92	“ One second . ”
57957	57965	57955	57955	Lia	168	“ Looks like Huxley has some updates . ”
57966	57974	57951	57951	I	0	“ Oooo , Shoemacher is going down . ”
58532	58555	58514	58530	Birdy on the other side wearing a pair of silk shorts and a simple black tank top	935	“ You brought cupcakes ? I thought you would n’t have any left after how you took them down in the class . ”
58556	58566	58567	58567	I	0	“ I went on a one - day detox . ”
58611	58619	58620	58620	She	931	“ I ’m glad you ’re here . ”
58744	58754	58737	58737	she	931	“ I need to talk to you about something . ”
58755	58760	58761	58761	I	0	“ Uh , okay , ”
58771	58778	58764	58764	I	0	“ Well , more like apologize . ”
58779	58788	58789	58789	I	0	“ You apologized enough about the baking class , ”
58792	58800	58789	58789	I	0	“ And I had fun , oddly . ”
58801	58816	58817	58817	She	931	“ It ’s not about the baking class . It ’s about . . . ”
58823	58827	58817	58817	She	931	“ The kiss . ”
58828	58838	58841	58841	her	931	“ Oh , uh , what about the kiss ? ”
58843	58850	58839	58839	I	0	“ I know it was awkward . ”
58851	58858	58859	58859	I	0	“ What are you talking about ? ”
58871	58925	58859	58859	I	0	“ I was nervous and clammed up when I kissed you . I ’m honestly surprised you ’re even here after that kiss . When I got your text , I gasped . I was waiting on a late - night Friday phone call telling me you ca n’t meet up to hike . ”
58926	58929	58839	58839	I	0	“ Birdy — ”
58930	58939	58940	58940	she	931	“ I ’m a better kisser than that , ”
58946	58963	58940	58940	she	931	“ Much better . I ’m just , God , I ’m so nervous around you . ”
58964	58967	58968	58968	I	0	“ Why ? ”
58971	58981	58968	58968	I	0	“ I do n’t think I ’m very intimidating . ”
58982	59062	59077	59077	she	941	“ You ’re not . That ’s the problem . If you were some alpha asshole , then yeah , I probably would n’t feel so jittery around you , but you ’re a nice guy , a sweet one , and you ’re the kind of guy who ’s hard to find , especially in Los Angeles . I keep telling myself I ’m going to blow it , and I truly thought I did with that kiss . ”
59063	59071	59072	59072	I	0	“ You need to stop overthinking things , ”
59114	59147	59077	59077	she	941	“ I ’m sorry . I ’m just so caught up in my previous relationship that it ’s difficult to shake those thoughts in my head . But I ’ll do better . ”
59148	59153	59154	59154	I	0	“ Take your time , ”
59168	59192	59154	59154	I	0	“ I do n’t plan on going anywhere , and as it stands , we ’re still going on that hike on Saturday . ”
59193	59209	59077	59077	she	941	“ Good , because I went shopping today and got the perfect outfit for it . ”
59210	59214	59215	59215	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? ”
59221	59236	59215	59215	I	0	“ Was n’t sure there was a perfect hike slash birdwatching outfit out there . ”
59237	59249	59077	59077	she	941	“ If you look hard enough . You can find it . ”
59250	59258	59077	59077	she	941	“ Tell me more about this outfit . ”
59259	59273	59077	59077	she	941	“ Oh no , no sneak peeks . It will be a surprise . ”
59274	59295	59297	59297	she	941	“ Well , if it ’s not a shirt with a bird on it , I will be incredibly disappointed . ”
59344	59355	59334	59334	I	0	“ So did you go wedding planning with Lia today ? ”
59356	59364	59365	59365	She	941	“ Yup , checked out some flowers . ”
59416	59424	59413	59413	I	0	“ What did you end up choosing ? ”
59425	59430	59431	59431	I	0	“ Now , Birdy , ”
59434	59454	59431	59431	I	0	“ What kind of Pickle of Honor would I be if I gave out the secrets of the wedding ? ”
59455	59465	59413	59413	I	0	“ Pickle of Honor ? This needs some explanation . ”
59466	59590	59591	59591	She	942	“ Lia and I are huge Scrabble nerds . We were in a club together in college , and one night , it was just me and her playing , which is usually how the club gathering ended anyway . I was exhausted but needed to beat her at one more game . I had the workings to spell pickle and accidentally spelled it wrong . And of course , I was a cocky son of a bitch back then , especially when Scrabble was involved , so I called out my points like a master , and she pointed at the board , saying I spelled it wrong . It was humiliating , and the name stuck . I ’m her pickle . ”
59594	59607	59591	59591	She	942	“ You know , pickle could be thought of as something else . ”
59616	59627	59613	59613	my	0	“ Trust me , this pickle has never gone there . ”
59633	59660	59628	59628	She	942	“ Well , I love your friendship . I think it ’s sweet . Do you have a lot of close friends ? Or just Lia ? ”
59661	59790	59791	59791	I	0	“ Well , I used to hang out with my brothers until they got married . That ’s put a real damper on our basketball games . I still see them , but it ’s more of a group thing , which grants their wives access to my personal business . They can be very needy when it comes to knowing all about my single life and how they can make me . . . un - single . And then there ’s my friend Banner , who just started working with us . He ’s pretty cool , but he ’s seeing this girl Kenzie , well , sort of seeing her . I do n’t know where they stand . So he ’s occupied with that . ”
59797	59813	59791	59791	I	0	“ Looks like I ’m at that time in my life where everyone pairs up . ”
59814	59821	59822	59822	Birdy	118	“ I know what you mean , ”
59825	59868	59822	59822	Birdy	118	“ When I was with my ex , it was as if everyone was getting married or having kids . We did couple things together , and when we broke up , it was as if no one had time for me . ”
59869	59880	59791	59791	I	0	“ That ’s shitty , but I know the feeling . ”
59881	59889	59890	59890	she	118	“ Ca n’t blame them , though , ”
59893	59901	59890	59890	she	118	“ They ’re in love after all . ”
59902	59939	59791	59791	I	0	“ I guess so . I think that ’s what has put a fire in me to meet someone . I ’m not desperate or anything , but I also do n’t want to be lonely . ”
59940	59979	59980	59980	She	118	“ I totally get that . I ’m the same way . I do n’t need someone to be happy , but it ’s fun to do things with someone . . . you know , like hiking . ”
59992	59997	59980	59980	She	118	“ And icing pussies . ”
60010	60017	60004	60004	she	118	“ Exactly . Like icing pussies . ”
60030	60034	60022	60022	I	0	“ Come here . ”
60060	60066	60046	60046	I	0	“ How was work today ? ”
60067	60085	60046	60046	I	0	“ That ’s what you ’re going to ask me while I ’m sitting on your lap ? ”
60086	60089	60090	60090	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
60100	60137	60090	60090	I	0	“ I have all of my everyday conversations like this . You should see the fistfights I get into with my brothers over who gets to be the bottom and who gets to be the top . ”
60154	60167	60145	60145	she	118	“ Oh , what an image that has formed in my head . ”
60168	60233	60145	60145	she	118	“ We find if we sit on each other ’s laps , we can focus on the conversation and block out distractions . I ’ve had hour - long conversations on JP ’s lap where we ’ve brainstormed over our next business venture . If it was n’t for the obvious HR violation , we would have everyone sit on each other ’s laps . ”
60234	60287	60145	60145	she	118	“ You know , maybe you ’re onto something . My marketing brain is thinking that you could form some sort of device that prevents pelvis - to - pelvis contact but allows the same position . Oh , and you can add some horse blinders to really keep out the distraction . ”
60288	60300	60301	60301	She	943	“ Wow , Birdy . Wow . That ’s positively genius . ”
60307	60325	60301	60301	She	943	“ Thank you , but the idea goes to you . I ’m just the dream maker . ”
60326	60336	60145	60145	she	118	“ Is that what you call yourself at work ? ”
60337	60380	60301	60301	She	943	“ When I strike it big with a huge idea , of course . I quietly print out a certificate of completion with the name dream maker on it . I have a whole folder of them . In my desk drawer . ”
60381	60398	60145	60145	she	118	“ A whole folder would imply that you ’re very good at being a dream maker . ”
60399	60403	60301	60301	She	943	“ I am . ”
60562	60569	60570	60570	Birdy	118	“ Are you thirsty or anything ? ”
60573	60600	60570	60570	Birdy	118	“ Nah , I ’m good . I should probably get going , though , because I ’m sure you need to wake up early tomorrow . ”
60609	60623	60601	60601	I	0	“ I do happen to have a five thirty wake - up call . ”
60624	60638	60606	60606	her	943	“ Yeah , I have a meeting with Hux tomorrow at his place . ”
60639	60646	60647	60647	Her	943	“ Okay , well . . . ”
60654	60665	60647	60647	Her	943	“ I guess I should walk you to the door . ”
60726	60733	60709	60709	her	943	“ Thank you for coming over . ”
60734	60759	60709	60709	her	943	“ Yeah , I had a nice time , even though you ’re not a fan of the Kylo Ren and Rey love affair . ”
60760	60769	60770	60770	she	943	“ I just ca n’t get on board , ”
60776	60785	60770	60770	she	943	“ Sorry . Does n’t work for me . ”
60786	60791	60792	60792	I	0	“ Such a disappointment , ”
61006	61009	60998	60998	I	0	“ Better ? ”
61010	61013	61014	61014	She	943	“ Much . ”
61022	61027	61016	61016	her	943	“ So much better . ”
61028	61031	61032	61032	I	0	“ Good . ”
61047	61057	61032	61032	I	0	“ I ’ll see you Saturday for that hike . ”
61058	61063	61064	61064	she	943	“ Yes , Saturday , ”
61078	61083	61067	61067	I	0	“ Night , Breaker . ”
61084	61089	61090	61090	I	0	“ Night , Birdy , ”
61104	61109	61110	61110	Lottie	96	“ Morning , Breaker , ”
61121	61126	61113	61113	she	96	“ How are you ? ”
61127	61130	61131	61131	I	0	“ Good , ”
61134	61139	61131	61131	I	0	“ What about yourself ? ”
61161	61165	61140	61140	She	943	“ Doing okay . ”
61191	61198	61178	61178	He	92	“ Can I get you anything ? ”
61208	61213	61201	61201	her	943	“ I ’m good . ”
61230	61237	61240	61240	him	92	“ What does it feel like ? ”
61251	61258	61248	61248	he	92	“ What does what feel like ? ”
61259	61288	61248	61248	he	92	“ To be that in love . You ’re so protective , possessive , infatuated . I do n’t think I ’ve ever been like that with someone . ”
61289	61295	61296	61296	he	92	“ Of course you have , ”
61299	61307	61296	61296	he	92	“ You ’re that way with Lia . ”
61308	61317	61248	61248	he	92	“ Lia and I are n’t romantically involved . ”
61318	61371	61372	61372	I	0	“ You might not be , but you know how you get when Brian ’s mom picks on her , that instinctual feeling like you will do fucking anything to make sure no one hurts your girl ? That ’s the feeling . That deep - seated feeling that never goes away . ”
61378	61399	61372	61372	I	0	“ I get that feeling with Lia , but not on a romantic level , on a best friend level . ”
61400	61427	61428	61428	He	955	“ Well , when you finally fall in love with someone , that feeling you have with Lia will transfer over . Why do you ask ? ”
61439	61574	61437	61437	him	955	“ I ’ve sort of gone out with this girl the last few days , and she ’s pretty awesome . Beautiful and smart . Great sense of humor . We do n’t have much in common , but she ’s sweet , quick - witted , and interesting . I went to her place last night , and we talked a lot , she even sat on my lap for a while , but I did n’t have this overwhelming need to touch her . I kept my hands on her legs because I felt like that was the right thing to do , and when I kissed her good night , I really fucking liked it , but I do n’t know , I do n’t think I felt anything with her . ”
61575	61582	61583	61583	Huxley	92	“ Was she a bad kisser ? ”
61605	61614	61594	61594	I	0	“ No , a really good kisser actually . ”
61627	61667	61615	61615	I	0	“ I do n’t know , man . I think I ’m going through some shit , and I do n’t know how to process it . I think this lawsuit and the wedding are fucking with my head . ”
61668	61677	61678	61678	Huxley	92	“ Do you want to like this girl ? ”
61681	61723	61678	61678	Huxley	92	“ I do n’t want to be left behind . Alone . Everyone I know is either married , getting married , or in a relationship . I ’m just over in my lonely apartment playing fucking Tetris on my computer . ”
61724	61735	61615	61615	I	0	“ That never bothered you before . You love Tetris . ”
61736	61741	61742	61742	I	0	“ I still do , ”
61746	61795	61742	61742	I	0	“ Fucking love it , but I do n’t know , it just feels like I ’m at a point in my life when maybe I should have a serious girlfriend . I ’ve never really had one before , and that ’s sort of weird , right ? ”
61796	61836	61615	61615	I	0	“ You never needed one before . You ’ve leaned on Lia for female companionship , and when you ’ve wanted sex , you ’ve had your fun . You ’ve had the perfect setup for quite some time . ”
61837	61869	61742	61742	I	0	“ Wait , do you really think that ’s it ? That ’s why I have n’t had a true girlfriend ? Because I ’ve leaned on Lia all these years ? ”
61870	61873	61874	61874	Huxley	92	“ Yes , ”
61879	61899	61874	61874	Huxley	92	“ It ’s frightening that you have n’t taken note of that before . It ’s so fucking obvious . ”
61900	61905	61906	61906	I	0	“ Not to me , ”
61923	61944	61909	61909	I	0	“ Do you think that ’s why I have n’t found someone ? Because I ’ve been content with Lia ? ”
61955	61958	61959	61959	he	92	“ Yes , ”
61962	61984	61959	61959	he	92	“ That ’s exactly why , because why do you need a girlfriend when Lia is all you ’ve ever needed ? ”
61985	61996	61950	61950	his	92	“ Jesus . I never thought of it that way . ”
62067	62087	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ Glad I can enlighten you . Now , can we get back to why you ’re really here ? ”
62088	62093	62094	62094	I	0	“ I guess so , ”
62101	62128	62094	62094	I	0	“ But just one second . Do you think I should . . . I do n’t know , stop hanging out with Lia so much ? ”
62135	62151	62129	62129	Huxley	92	“ Why would you do that ? You ’re just going to hurt her feelings . ”
62152	62174	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ Yeah , but she has Brian , so should n’t there be like . . . a transition of power ? ”
62175	62187	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ You ’re not the goddamn President of the United States . ”
62188	62193	62194	62194	I	0	“ I know that , ”
62199	62242	62194	62194	I	0	“ But with Brian and Lia getting married soon , should n’t I back away a bit ? Brian already has issues with how much time Lia and I spend together . Like , I should hand him the torch , right ? ”
62243	62270	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ I do n’t know . If you think you should , then go for it . Now can we talk about the lawsuit , please ? ”
62271	62276	62277	62277	I	0	“ Sure , sorry , ”
62283	62343	62277	62277	I	0	“ It ’s just that I saw Birdy last night and the kiss was good , but I did n’t feel a spark , and I was n’t sure if I should be feeling a spark or if it ’s too soon to feel a spark ? I do n’t know , did you feel a spark with Lottie ? ”
62358	62374	62344	62344	Huxley	92	“ You tell me , do you think I felt a spark with my wife ? ”
62375	62387	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ From what I ’ve observed , I would say yes . ”
62388	62391	62392	62392	he	92	“ Immediately , ”
62395	62442	62392	62392	he	92	“ I might have thought she was annoying , frustrating , and downright irritating most of the time , but there was no doubt in my mind that she was the prettiest fucking thing I ’d ever seen , and I wanted her in my bed . ”
62443	62446	62447	62447	I	0	“ Ah , ”
62452	62459	62447	62447	I	0	“ Same you think with JP ? ”
62460	62494	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ Dude , seriously ? Come on , you saw JP when he met Kelsey for the first time . The man had heart eyes coming out of every orifice of his body . ”
62495	62501	62502	62502	I	0	“ Yeah , I know . ”
62508	62560	62502	62502	I	0	“ It ’s not like that with Birdy . But I also wonder if I have a mental block now , and I ’m not allowing myself to feel for her the way I should because of the leaning on Lia thing . Do you think that could be an issue ? ”
62561	62588	62060	62060	Man	2061	“ I think there ’s going to be a huge fucking issue soon if we do n’t stop talking about this and get down to business . ”
62589	62598	62599	62599	I	0	“ Yeah , okay . . . sorry . ”
62605	62639	62599	62599	I	0	“ Real quick though , what are your thoughts on Kylo and Rey ? Is it weird I ’m considering dating someone who does n’t believe in the love affair as I do ? ”
62640	62645	62648	62649	LIA Lia	960	“ Jesus fucking Christ . ”
63387	63389	63380	63380	Lia	168	“ anyway ”
63828	63833	63834	63834	he	985	“ Hello , sweetheart , ”
63848	63860	63834	63834	he	985	“ Thought I ’d surprise you with some flowers and . . .”—he
63865	63868	63834	63834	he	985	bag—“a sleepover . ”
63869	63874	63875	63875	I	0	“ Oh , wow , ”
63889	63903	63875	63875	I	0	“ I was , uh . . . I was not expecting that . ”
63904	63910	63911	63911	He	985	“ Yeah , neither was I. ”
63938	63946	63935	63935	Brian	100	“ It was actually Breaker ’s idea . ”
63953	63993	63935	63935	Brian	100	“ He also told me to pick up Sour Patch Kids and Sprite , so that ’s in the bag as well . Not sure why , but he said it ’s what you guys need while playing Password . ”
63994	64003	64063	64063	Breaker	68	“ Breaker told you to do all this ? ”
64004	64037	64038	64038	Brian	100	“ Well , the flowers were my idea , but game night was his . Said since he wo n’t be around as much , I should learn the things you love . ”
64143	64173	64140	64140	I	0	“ Uh , Brian , I need to make an important business call . I ’m going to run over to Breaker ’s so I do n’t bother you . ”
64174	64185	64186	64186	I	0	“ Oh , I can be quiet if you want . ”
64191	64218	64186	64186	I	0	“ Trust me , these walls are paper thin . You could hear everything . Just make yourself comfortable , and I ’ll be back shortly . ”
64219	64225	64226	64226	I	0	“ Okay . Love you . ”
64231	64235	64226	64226	I	0	“ Love you . ”
64317	64323	64324	64324	I	0	“ Lia , everything okay ? ”
64338	64346	64324	64324	I	0	“ No , everything is not okay . ”
64347	64352	64353	64353	he	68	“ Okay . . . ”
64357	64366	64353	64353	he	68	“ Well , I was just headed out — ”
64367	64381	64394	64394	he	68	“ Really ? You ’re not going to ask me what ’s wrong ? ”
64382	64390	64391	64391	he	68	“ I have a feeling I know , ”
64456	64462	64445	64445	He	68	“ What ’s going on ? ”
64463	64469	64470	64470	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
64479	64504	64470	64470	I	0	“ How about you tell me what ’s going on , because last I checked , you ’re pawning our traditions off onto Brian . ”
64505	64518	64445	64445	He	68	“ I ’m not pawning them off . I ’m including him . ”
64519	64549	64445	64445	He	68	“ I do n’t need you to include him . I do my own things with Brian . What I need you to do is stop pushing me away . ”
64550	64564	64470	64470	I	0	“ I literally saw you yesterday . How is that pushing you away ? ”
64565	64583	64584	64584	He	997	“ You saw me for wedding things . You ’re pushing me away from our normal stuff . ”
64613	64618	64619	64619	I	0	“ Just say it , ”
64630	64663	64622	64622	He	997	“ So is this how it ’s going to be , Breaker ? I ’m engaged to be married , and now you wo n’t even tell me what you ’re thinking ? ”
64664	64675	64624	64624	his	997	“ I ca n’t tell you what I ’m thinking . ”
64676	64680	64681	64681	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
64684	64691	64692	64692	he	997	“ Because it ’s about you , ”
64715	64742	64707	64707	he	997	“ Well , if it ’s about me , then just tell me . Clearly , it ’s something you need to get off your chest . ”
64743	64746	64747	64747	he	997	“ Fine , ”
64757	64791	64747	64747	he	997	“ You want to talk ? We can talk . We ’ve relied on each other too much , and I realized today that I ’m not in a relationship because of you . ”
64792	64796	64797	64797	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
64800	64812	64797	64797	I	0	“ Uh , care to explain how that ’s my fault ? ”
64813	64836	64747	64747	he	997	“ Because you became my safety net . Why do I need a companion when I have you to fall back on ? ”
64837	64863	64747	64747	he	997	“ So basically , because I was being a good friend , you ’re mad at me and trying to extract me from your life ? ”
64864	64867	64797	64797	I	0	“ No . ”
64876	64885	64868	64868	He	998	“ That ’s not what I ’m saying . ”
64886	64953	64747	64747	he	997	“ Then what exactly are you saying , Breaker ? Because it seems to me like you ’re having some sort of relationship crisis because I ’m getting married , and now you ’re desperate to find someone , and the one person you have been seeing is n’t exactly what you were looking for . Therefore , you ’re blaming me for all of it . ”
64954	64957	64958	64958	He	998	“ Wow . ”
64969	64985	64958	64958	He	998	“ That ’s not what I was fucking saying . Way to twist my words . ”
64994	65001	64986	64986	I	0	“ Then what are you saying ? ”
65002	65014	64958	64958	He	998	“ We ’re just . . . we ’re too close . ”
65015	65019	65020	65020	I	0	“ Too close ? ”
65024	65046	65020	65020	I	0	“ Okay , so the friendship we ’ve built over the last decade is too good . That ’s the problem ? ”
65051	65084	65020	65020	I	0	“ Okay , good to know . I ’m sorry for caring about you so much and being a part of your life to the point that I ’ve actually hurt you . ”
65085	65091	65092	65092	he	998	“ Lia , do n’t , ”
65099	65106	65107	65107	I	0	“ No , you do n’t , ”
65116	65232	65110	65110	I	0	“ That ’s really shitty , Breaker , for you to push me away because you think I ’ve prevented you from finding someone to be with . I ’ve done nothing of the sort . Your dating life is your problem , not mine . Maybe instead of looking at the people who love you and support you to blame , try looking inward . I ’m not the reason you ’re not with someone . The reason you ’re single is because you do n’t ever think anyone is good enough . Your standards are so impossibly high that no one will ever match them . That ’s the problem . Not me . ”
65249	65254	65240	65240	he	999	“ Lia , wait . ”
65263	65300	65255	65255	I	0	“ And what ’s the big deal anyway ? Why now ? Why do you have to find someone now ? Just because I ’m getting married , you think you need to get married too ? ”
65301	65304	65311	65311	his	999	“ No , ”
65314	65355	65305	65305	he	999	“ Then why is this a thing right now ? Why are you making this an issue ? I ’ve dated other guys . Yes , not many , but I ’ve had boyfriends . Why is this so different ? ”
65356	65362	65363	65363	he	999	“ I do n’t know , ”
65438	65449	65450	65450	I	0	“ Maybe that ’s something you need to figure out . ”
65457	65466	65450	65450	I	0	“ Lia , I ’m sorry , okay ? ”
65467	65473	65474	65474	I	0	“ No , not okay . ”
65479	65555	65474	65474	I	0	“ This is not how we treat each other . I do n’t know what ’s going through your head right now , what could possess you to have these thoughts and drastic ideas of pushing me toward Brian when I do n’t need pushing , but I will tell you one thing . It ’s going to drive a wedge between us . If that ’s what you want , then job well done . ”
65564	65590	65556	65556	I	0	“ And do n’t worry about Friday . It ’s just looking for a dress , so I wo n’t need your help with that . ”
65636	65648	65649	65649	Brian	100	“ Uh , I do n’t know . . . dishwasher ? ”
65659	65671	65649	65649	Brian	100	“ How could you possibly get dishwasher from the clue shark ? ”
65672	65678	65679	65679	Brian	100	“ I do n’t know , ”
65684	65691	65679	65679	Brian	100	“ This game makes no sense . ”
65692	65719	65649	65649	Brian	100	“ How does it not make sense ? You offer a clue to your partner , and then they try to guess , simple as that . ”
65720	65728	65649	65649	Brian	100	“ But your clues are n’t helping . ”
65729	65743	65649	65649	Brian	100	“ I gave you three clues . Mouth , dentist , and shark . ”
65744	65759	65760	65760	he	999	“ Yeah , great clues . How the hell do those even go together ? ”
65763	65766	65767	65767	I	0	“ Teeth ! ”
65770	65789	65767	65767	I	0	“ My God , Brian , the password is teeth ! You should have gotten it with dentist . ”
65790	65833	65649	65649	Brian	100	“ Well , this is my first time playing . I ’m sorry I ’m not as good as Breaker . Maybe if you were n’t shoving all this godforsaken sugar down my throat , I would have been able to guess . ”
65834	65843	65844	65844	I	0	“ I was n’t comparing you to Breaker , ”
65850	65867	65844	65844	I	0	“ You did n’t have to . I could see it written all over your face . ”
65868	65872	65873	65873	I	0	“ Great assumption , ”
65889	65925	65926	65926	I	0	“ Because apparently , you know exactly what ’s going on in my head , besides what I ’m really thinking about , and what I ’m really thinking about is freaking TEETH ! God , ”
65932	65949	65926	65926	I	0	“ I ’m going to bed . Feel free to go home if you ’d like . ”
66028	66035	66017	66017	Brian	100	“ I ’m sorry , Lia . ”
66201	66208	66209	66209	Brian	100	“ Hey , are you okay ? ”
66217	66222	66223	66223	I	0	“ N - No , ”
66253	66261	66262	66262	he	1015	“ Jesus , what ’s going on ? ”
66273	66293	66262	66262	he	1015	“ You ’re pale . Lia , what ’s happening ? Do you want me to call for help ? ”
66313	66327	66294	66294	I	0	“ No . Just . . . just let me get some sleep . ”
66328	66357	66358	66358	He	1015	“ You think I ’m going to leave you like this ? You almost hit your head on the counter . There ’s no way I ’m leaving . ”
66372	66384	66358	66358	He	1015	“ Talk to me , Lia . What ’s going on ? ”
66385	66391	66392	66392	My	0	“ I just . . . ”
66398	66405	66406	66406	I	0	“ I ’m just freaking out , ”
66456	66463	66444	66444	Brian	100	“ Freaking out about the wedding ? ”
66464	66471	66472	66472	I	0	“ About . . . us , ”
66480	66485	66486	66486	he	1015	“ What about us ? ”
66489	66584	66486	66486	he	1015	“ We ca n’t play Password . We ’re getting married , Brian . We should be able to play Password . And . . . and the wedding planning is a nightmare . I ’ve set things on fire and bloodied people and swatted your mother ’s breast , and we ca n’t seem to agree on much . And you do n’t care about the plans , which is fine . I know you ’re busy , but . . . it does n’t seem like we ’re on the same wavelength . ”
66585	66589	66590	66590	he	1015	“ We are , ”
66593	66636	66590	66590	he	1015	“ That ’s just a stupid game , which proves nothing . What we do in our everyday life , our thoughts , and our morals , that ’s what matters . And we are on the same wavelength there . Right ? ”
66637	66640	66641	66641	I	0	“ Yes , ”
66717	66729	66730	66730	I	0	“ But . . . do you know everything about me ? ”
66733	66739	66740	66740	he	1015	“ Of course I do , ”
66743	66870	66871	66871	He	1019	“ And what I do n’t know , I ’ll spend the rest of our lives finding out . Getting married to someone does n’t mean you know a list of facts about your partner like some reality trivia game . I ’m marrying you because you make me happy , because I ca n’t imagine a day when I do n’t think about you in my life , and because I love you , Lia . I ’m not marrying you because I happen to know what you like to order from the sandwich shop around the corner or because you can telepathically answer a stupid Password question . Those are all menial things when it comes to getting married . It does n’t matter . ”
66879	66887	66873	66873	his	1019	“ This matters . Our love matters . ”
66946	66951	66952	66952	I	0	“ Lia , hey , ”
67146	67168	67170	67170	he	165	“ Those are all menial things when it comes to getting married . It does n’t matter . Our love matters . ”
67228	67233	67234	67234	I	0	“ Hey , Birdy , ”
67244	67254	67255	67255	she	2233	“ Oh wow , your hair looks so shiny , ”
67262	67267	67255	67255	she	2233	“ It ’s beautiful . ”
67268	67322	67336	67336	she	118	“ Oh , thanks . I went to the salon around the corner and got it blown out . I ’m trying on dresses today , and my soon - to - be mother - in - law told me to make sure my hair resembled what I wanted on my wedding day . ”
67323	67326	67327	67327	Birdy	118	“ Beautiful , ”
67342	67348	67331	67331	I	0	“ Is your color natural ? ”
67349	67352	67353	67353	I	0	“ Yes , ”
67356	67367	67353	67353	I	0	“ My dad descended from a long line of redheads . ”
67368	67373	67374	67374	She	2233	“ I ’m jealous . ”
67415	67426	67405	67405	Breaker	68	“ So you headed over to the dress shop now ? ”
67427	67452	67381	67381	she	2233	“ Yes , I ’m just going to grab some coffee first because I ’ll need some caffeine to get through this shopping trip . ”
67458	67469	67455	67455	Birdy	118	“ Should n’t shopping for a wedding dress be fun ? ”
67483	67495	67496	67496	I	0	“ My future mother - in - law can be difficult . ”
67502	67550	67551	67551	She	1028	“ Well , she should n’t have a say in it , but that ’s just my opinion . Anyway , I wo n’t keep you from your appointment . I just wanted to say hi and thank you and Brian for setting me up with Breaker . ”
67559	67591	67592	67592	She	1028	“ He ’s amazing . I do n’t know how he ’s still single , but I lucked out , because he ’s everything I could ask for in a man . ”
67612	67622	67592	67592	She	1028	“ And quite the kisser . Oh my God . ”
67633	67643	67644	67644	I	0	“ Well , I ’m glad to hear it , ”
67659	67676	67644	67644	I	0	“ Okay , have fun . I ’m going to meet up with Breaker right now . ”
67692	67697	67698	67698	I	0	“ Yeah , bye , ”
68098	68105	68106	68107	The Beave	111	“ Ah , there she is , ”
68114	68123	68106	68107	The Beave	111	“ My dear , look at your hair . ”
68129	68135	68136	68136	She	111	“ It ’s so lovely . ”
68147	68165	68136	68136	She	111	“ I would prefer you have an updo for the wedding , but this is quite appealing . ”
68208	68212	68213	68213	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
68224	68232	68213	68213	I	0	“ Are we the only ones here ? ”
68233	68277	68278	68278	We	1048	“ Oh , I blocked off the shop for us so we wo n’t be disturbed by any other people searching for a dress . I thought having the shop to ourselves could ensure we stay focused on what we ’re looking for . ”
68292	68302	68303	68303	she	755	“ We do have at least three to find , ”
68313	68323	68324	68324	I	0	“ Yes , a lot of shopping to do , ”
68345	68357	68358	68358	she	755	“ Now , where is Breaker so we can get started ? ”
68382	68391	68392	68392	I	0	“ Oh , uh , something came up , ”
68395	68405	68392	68392	I	0	“ He wo n’t be able to make it . ”
68438	68473	68430	68430	she	755	“ Well then , let ’s get started . We ’ll be trying on ceremony dresses first . I had them pull classic silhouettes as well as elegant off - the - shoulder pieces . ”
68474	68477	68478	68478	I	0	“ Great , ”
68486	68496	68497	68501	one of the shop assistants	1050	“ Right this way , Miss Fairweather - Fern , ”
68504	68535	68497	68501	one of the shop assistants	1050	“ Please just call me Lia . If you need to add a miss in there , Miss Lia is just fine . Using my whole name is a mouthful . ”
68603	68611	68612	68613	the assistant	747	“ Here is a robe for you , ”
68616	68643	68612	68613	the assistant	747	“ Why do n’t you get changed out of your clothes and dressed in the robe , and an attendant will come in and assist you ? ”
68644	68650	68612	68613	the assistant	747	“ Great . Thank you . ”
69060	69065	69056	69056	I	0	“ I ’m ready . ”
69151	69154	69155	69155	he	68	“ Shhhh , ”
69199	69205	69206	69206	I	0	“ I thought . . . ”
69211	69223	69224	69224	He	68	“ I thought you . . . you were n’t coming . ”
69233	69242	69224	69224	He	68	“ I would never miss this , Lia . ”
69243	69256	69257	69257	I	0	“ But . . . we have n’t . . . talked . ”
69276	69287	69288	69288	He	68	“ I thought we needed a second to gather ourselves . ”
69293	69330	69288	69288	He	68	“ I did n’t handle things right with you , and I thought that if I gave us a second , I could express what I ’ve been feeling rather than blaming you for my problems . ”
69331	69341	69342	69342	I	0	“ I do n’t want to talk about it , ”
69345	69353	69342	69342	I	0	“ I just want to hold you . ”
69374	69383	69354	69354	He	68	“ I ca n’t lose you , Breaker . ”
69384	69403	69342	69342	I	0	“ You ’re not losing me , Lia . Never . I would never let that fucking happen . ”
69404	69407	69408	69408	I	0	“ Promise ? ”
69423	69428	69429	69429	he	68	“ I promise you , ”
69439	69471	69434	69434	I	0	“ I ran into Birdy at the coffeehouse , and she said she was meeting up with you . I thought . . . I thought you ditched me for her . ”
69472	69475	69476	69476	he	68	“ Never , ”
69484	69500	69476	69476	he	68	“ I had to give her some binoculars to practice with for our hike tomorrow . ”
69501	69504	69505	69505	I	0	“ Really ? ”
69517	69540	69505	69505	I	0	“ Yes , really . This is an important day , Lia , of course , I would be here for it . ”
69541	69545	69546	69546	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
69626	69637	69638	69638	he	68	“ What ’s going on in that head of yours ? ”
69641	69655	69638	69638	he	68	“ Just grateful you ’re here . More grateful than you probably know . ”
69656	69678	69679	69679	I	0	“ No matter what happens between us , Lia , I will always be there for you . Always . Okay ? ”
69696	69740	69683	69683	he	68	“ As much as I just want to sit here with you , I have to get back out there . The Beave is already pissed at me because I showed up late , and I do n’t want to make her madder . ”
69741	69746	69747	69747	I	0	“ Do n’t leave , ”
69753	69760	69747	69747	I	0	“ Help me into these dresses . ”
69761	69774	69775	69775	I	0	“ Uh , do n’t you want an attendant to do that ? ”
69780	69814	69775	69775	I	0	“ I ’m so freaking raw right now , Breaker . I can barely breathe . I need you in here , with me , by my side . Please stay . . . ”
69883	69891	69892	69892	I	0	“ Of course , I can stay , ”
69908	69912	69913	69914	the attendant	1052	“ Miss Lia , ”
69917	69927	69913	69914	the attendant	1052	“ Are you ready to try on some dresses ? ”
69949	69994	69939	69939	I	0	“ Actually , I ’m going to help her into her dresses , if you do n’t mind . Can you pull a few simple gowns with some of that lace detail on them ? Especially the one that is upfront on the mannequin . ”
69995	70004	70005	70005	I	0	“ Yes , of course , Mr. Cane . ”
70015	70063	70013	70013	Lia	168	“ If I ’m going to wiggle you in and out of these things , then we ’re going to put you in dresses that are actually your style . None of this poofy , embellished bullshit . I ’m no expert , but these are atrocious . ”
70095	70101	70102	70102	she	168	“ They ’re not great , ”
70121	70148	70110	70110	She	168	“ This is the same fabric as the robe I ’m wearing . People would be able to see every lump and bump on my body . ”
70149	70187	70188	70188	She	168	“ Well , for one , you do n’t have lumps and bumps besides the two on your chest , and secondly , I ’m not sure those are the kind of dresses you wear undergarments with . ”
70191	70209	70188	70188	She	168	“ I need undergarments . I ’m not one to show nipple to a crowd of people . ”
70210	70216	70217	70217	I	0	“ Only a select few ? ”
70221	70224	70225	70225	she	168	“ Obviously , ”
70237	70243	70225	70225	she	168	“ What are you doing ? ”
70252	70273	70246	70247	The Beave	111	“ Why are you taking in more dresses ? We have n’t even seen her try on the first ones . ”
70312	70325	70326	70326	I	0	“ Mrs. Beaver , could I possibly have a word with you ? ”
70334	70340	70341	70341	she	168	“ Well , of course , ”
70384	70395	70371	70371	She	810	“ What on earth is happening in that dressing room ? ”
70396	70414	70415	70415	I	0	“ The dresses that were chosen are beautiful , but they ’re not quite Lia ’s style . ”
70424	70456	70417	70417	my	0	“ She ’s very upset right now , and I do n’t want to cause a scene , so I thought we could try on some dresses that suit her more . ”
70457	70469	70371	70371	She	810	“ Upset ? For what reason ? This should be fun . ”
70470	70496	70497	70498	The Beave	111	“ I agree . That ’s why we should n’t dictate what she wears and be happy for what she thinks looks beautiful on her . ”
70503	70516	70497	70498	The Beave	111	“ Are you saying that I ’m trying to be too controlling ? ”
70528	70533	70534	70534	I	0	“ Not at all , ”
70540	70581	70534	70534	I	0	“ I know you ’re trying to be helpful , but I say let ’s give Lia a moment to pick , and then if she ca n’t find anything she likes , we offer suggestions . Does that work ? ”
70582	70586	70597	70597	her	1074	“ I suppose . ”
70587	70590	70591	70591	I	0	“ Great . ”
70617	70637	70600	70600	she	1074	“ I apologize for being late , by the way . I had a meeting that held me up . ”
70638	70650	70600	70600	she	1074	“ You are a busy man . How is the lawsuit ? ”
70651	70668	70600	70600	she	1074	“ Still confidential but should be brushed away soon . Huxley has it all under control . ”
70669	70676	70677	70677	I	0	“ I would assume he does . ”
70687	70704	70677	70677	I	0	“ Do you need me to get you anything , or are you good right now ? ”
70705	70712	70600	70600	she	1074	“ Quite well , thank you . ”
70713	70731	70732	70732	I	0	“ Okay , then I ’m going to go help Lia . We ’ll be right out . ”
70870	70876	70877	70877	she	168	“ What do you think ? ”
70919	70924	70925	70925	she	168	“ Is it bad ? ”
70966	70996	70997	70997	She	168	“ I think it ’s kind of whimsical , but do you think it ’s too much ? It was the one that called out to me the most . ”
71014	71019	71004	71004	her	168	“ You hate it . ”
71067	71089	71064	71064	I	0	“ No , I do n’t hate it . You look . . . fuck , you look stunning , Ophelia . ”
71132	71135	71129	71129	she	168	“ Really ? ”
71152	71158	71144	71144	I	0	“ Yeah , you look — ”
71206	71209	71210	71210	I	0	“ Wow , ”
71213	71222	71210	71210	I	0	“ Just . . . really fucking beautiful . ”
71223	71228	71229	71229	she	168	“ You ’re blushing , ”
71241	71263	71229	71229	she	168	“ Yeah , I just , uh , was n’t expecting to walk in here and see you in a dress . ”
71578	71584	71585	71585	she	168	“ Should I show her ? ”
71594	71604	71585	71585	she	168	“ I do n’t want her to hate it . ”
71605	71620	71621	71621	I	0	“ I do n’t care what she says . We ’re getting that dress , ”
71636	71658	71621	71621	I	0	“ But it ’s the first one . Is n’t that a bad sign ? Should n’t I try on more ? ”
71664	71673	71661	71661	my	0	“ No , sometimes , you just know . ”
71679	71692	71674	71674	I	0	“ And this dress , Lia , this one is for you . ”
71744	71768	71724	71724	she	168	“ Thank you for being here , Breaker . I do n’t think you will ever know how much this means to me . ”
71769	71776	71777	71777	I	0	“ No , uh , problem , ”
72315	72320	72311	72311	him	155	“ It ’s open . ”
72341	72354	72329	72329	him	155	“ Sounded like a beer kind of moment , am I right ? ”
72355	72360	72361	72361	I	0	“ Really fucking right , ”
72370	72376	72364	72364	He	155	“ Let ’s sit outside . ”
72474	72497	72498	72498	I	0	“ I know I ’ve only been here twice , but I do n’t think I ’ll ever get over your place , ”
72501	72563	72564	72564	I	0	“ Yeah , I feel pretty lucky . Although Ryot keeps trying to get me to move out to Malibu with him and Myla . Not ready for that yet . I love the beach , but out there , it almost feels like I ’m settling down , and I ’m not at that point in my life just yet . ”
72567	72582	72583	72583	He	1116	“ Forgive me if I ’m wrong , but are n’t you seeing someone ? ”
72593	72611	72583	72583	He	1116	“ Do n’t get me started on that . This gathering is about you , not me . ”
72612	72630	72583	72583	He	1116	“ We can save some time at the end to dig deep into your non - relationship . ”
72631	72644	72645	72645	He	1116	“ Ehh , that ’s okay . I think I ’m good . ”
72655	72684	72645	72645	He	1116	“ So what ’s going on ? Your text read desperate need of help , and if anything , I like a good story , so tell me . ”
72704	72714	72685	72685	I	0	“ You know Lia is getting married , right ? ”
72715	72728	72583	72583	He	1116	“ Yeah , and you ’re the man of honor , right ? ”
72729	72732	72733	72733	I	0	“ Right . ”
72746	72788	72733	72733	I	0	“ Hell , I do n’t think what I ’m going to say will make a lot of sense . It will sound like a bunch of rambling , but I do n’t know how to talk about this without rambling . ”
72789	72809	72583	72583	He	1116	“ Good thing you came to me . I ’m good at deciphering rambling . Lay it on me . ”
72810	72874	72733	72733	I	0	“ Well , to begin with , I was shocked when Lia told me she was engaged . She and Brian , they , I do n’t know , have a different relationship . I feel like when you ’re dating someone , you ’re all in , right ? Like , you want to spend as much time with them as possible . ”
72880	72888	72875	72875	Banner	155	“ Yeah , I know that feeling . ”
72889	72934	72583	72583	He	1116	“ Well , they are n’t like that . They can go a few nights without seeing each other , and I always thought that was weird , so when she said he proposed , and she said yes , I was truly shocked . ”
72935	72943	72583	72583	He	1116	“ Yeah , I would be too . ”
72944	72994	72875	72875	Banner	155	“ And then she told me they ’re getting married in five weeks , well , more like four weeks now . And I do n’t know , this sense of panic consumed me . I could n’t quite place it other than I was afraid to lose her . ”
72995	73006	72583	72583	He	1116	“ That ’s natural since you guys are so close . ”
73015	73018	73019	73019	I	0	“ Right , ”
73028	73105	73019	73019	I	0	“ That ’s what I thought too . We are so close that I ’m worried about losing that friendship . And I do n’t get along with her fiancé as much as I probably should , so I made an effort to reach out to him and solve that issue because I did n’t want anything weird between us , anything that he could use against me so she does n’t hang out as much . ”
73106	73110	73023	73023	my	0	“ Very smart . ”
73111	73131	73132	73132	Banner	155	“ But then he ended up setting me up with this girl , Birdy . On a double date . ”
73135	73145	73132	73132	Banner	155	“ That smells like a whole bunch of awkward . ”
73146	73174	73023	73023	my	0	“ It was . Very awkward , but Birdy turned out to be really cool and funny , and we ’ve hung out a few times since . ”
73175	73182	73023	73023	my	0	“ Okay , any chemistry there ? ”
73183	73189	73132	73132	Banner	155	“ That ’s the problem . ”
73204	73275	73190	73190	I	0	“ I ’ve kissed her twice now , and although the thought of being intimate with someone was appealing , each time I kissed her , it was n’t exactly what I was expecting . It just felt normal . Like every other woman I ’ve ever kissed , and I do n’t know , I feel like there should be a feeling that ’s more than normal , right ? ”
73276	73325	73132	73132	Banner	155	“ If you want to get down to it , yeah . When you kiss someone , someone you think you could date or be with , there should be a spark . Especially that first kiss . The first kiss tells you everything you need to know . ”
73326	73338	73339	73339	I	0	“ There was n’t any spark . Not even a blip . ”
73343	73351	73339	73339	I	0	“ And then . . . today . ”
73352	73362	73363	73363	Banner	155	“ Now we ’re getting to the good stuff , ”
73382	73455	73371	73371	he	155	“ Lia and I got in a fight two nights ago , and today was wedding dress shopping day . She told me not to come because of the fight , and there was no way I ’d let her do that alone , so I showed up , and the relief on her face was something I was n’t expecting . And she clung to me like I was her lifesaver . ”
73456	73463	73464	73464	Banner	155	“ Uh - huh . . . ”
73477	73490	73468	73468	I	0	“ Well , when I saw her in her dress . . . ”
73496	73569	73491	73491	I	0	“ Dude , I swear to God it was an out - of - body experience . I do n’t think I ’ve ever felt anything like it . My mouth went dry , I started to sweat , but I was cold at the same time . I could n’t breathe , but my heart was beating so hard that I thought my chest would explode . And then . . . ”
73574	73670	73570	73570	I	0	“ When she made eye contact with me , it was like a million butterflies took flight in my stomach , and I swear to you , at that moment , I had this overwhelming need to kiss her . Like , it was pulling me to the point that I almost did it . I ’ve never felt that way , ever , besides the first day I ever met her , and now , well , I ’m totally fucked in the head , and I do n’t know what ’s going on . ”
73696	73706	73707	73707	He	155	“ I ’ll tell you what ’s going on . ”
73714	73731	73707	73707	He	155	“ You ’re in love with your best friend , and you just finally realized it . ”
73732	73738	73739	73739	I	0	“ Come on , dude , ”
73744	73754	73739	73739	I	0	“ That ’s what my brothers would have said . ”
73755	73834	73707	73707	He	155	“ Because they ’re right , and I know you do n’t want to hear it , but why do you feel like you do n’t have a spark when you kiss other women ? It ’s because deep down , you know they ’re not Lia . These weird out - of - body feelings you ’re having are because the woman you love is getting married in four weeks , and you ’re panicking about it . ”
73835	73840	73894	73894	he	1118	“ But . . . ”
73841	73867	73868	73868	I	0	“ No buts , man . Face the facts , you love her , and the sooner you admit that to yourself , the better . ”
73967	73972	73973	73973	I	0	“ Jesus fucking Christ , ”
73982	73991	73973	73973	I	0	“ Fuck , I think I like her . ”
73997	74010	73994	73994	his	155	“ Nah , man . You love her . End of discussion . ”
74277	74282	74269	74269	I	0	“ Uh , yeah ? ”
74283	74293	74255	74255	her	1127	“ Breaker ? It ’s me . Open up . ”
74294	74307	74308	74308	I	0	“ Oh , uh . . . Lia , is that you ? ”
74316	74329	74308	74308	I	0	“ Yes , Breaker . What are you doing ? Open up . ”
74330	74335	74336	74336	I	0	“ Ha , sorry , ”
74347	74356	74336	74336	I	0	“ Um , just give me a second . ”
74468	74491	74492	74492	Her	1133	“ Hey there , uh , how are you ? Doing good ? Wow , the heat today , am I right ? ”
74499	74506	74492	74492	Her	1133	“ Why are you being weird ? ”
74507	74552	74561	74561	she	1133	“ I ’m not being weird , I ’m just . . . uh , striking up a conversation . Am I not allowed to talk about the weather with my best friend ? Anyway , is there anything I can help you with ? ”
74564	74571	74561	74561	she	1133	“ Can I stay here tonight ? ”
74572	74578	74579	74579	I	0	“ Uhhhh , what now ? ”
74587	74633	74561	74561	she	1133	“ Brian left for San Jose tonight for an emergency meeting with one of his clients , and he wo n’t be home until Sunday . I ’m just , I ’m not feeling super great , and I do n’t want to be alone . ”
74634	74640	74641	74641	I	0	“ Ah , I see . ”
74645	74653	74641	74641	I	0	“ So can I stay the night ? ”
74731	74735	74736	74736	I	0	“ Of course , ”
74740	74766	74736	74736	I	0	“ Yeah , you know , because you ’ve done that before . You ’ve stayed the night , so that should n’t be weird . ”
74773	74786	74767	74767	Her	1134	“ Why are you all fidgety and sweating on your upper lip ? ”
74787	74790	74791	74791	I	0	“ Sweating ? ”
74796	74810	74791	74791	I	0	“ That ’s not sweat . Probably just leftover residue from my drink . ”
74816	74824	74811	74811	She	1134	“ You ’re acting weird , Breaker . ”
74825	74834	74835	74835	I	0	“ You know , I had a beer . ”
74840	74873	74835	74835	I	0	“ Might have been an off - brand beer , probably is n’t settling well . Maybe I should just let you get to sleep . The guest room is made up . ”
74886	74895	74874	74874	I	0	“ Go ahead , make yourself at home . ”
74896	74912	74880	74880	she	1134	“ I do n’t want to go to bed yet . It ’s only eight . ”
74926	74939	74940	74940	I	0	“ Huh , well , guess that might be a touch early . ”
74947	74955	74940	74940	I	0	“ I guess we could hang out . ”
74956	74965	74966	74966	She	1134	“ Yeah , I was hoping we could . ”
75010	75014	75015	75015	I	0	“ Everything okay ? ”
75041	75044	75045	75045	Her	1134	“ No . ”
75051	75059	75045	75045	Her	1134	“ I ’m not okay at all . ”
75097	75103	75073	75073	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
75104	75109	75110	75110	She	1134	“ I ’m sad . ”
75116	75182	75110	75110	She	1134	“ Today was surreal , a moment I thought I would share with my mom one day , and the fact that she was n’t there , it ’s just killing me , Breaker . I keep wondering , would she have liked the dress I picked out ? Would she have cried ? Would she have taken a picture with me celebrating the moment ? ”
75183	75186	75187	75187	I	0	“ Yes , ”
75191	75200	75187	75187	I	0	“ Yes , to all of those things . ”
75201	75207	75208	75208	she	1134	“ I love that dress , ”
75211	75245	75208	75208	she	1134	“ But a part of me just feels empty about everything , and I wish I could be happy about getting married , but I have my doubts , I have my worries . ”
75246	75250	75251	75251	I	0	“ About Brian ? ”
75254	75260	75261	75261	she	1134	“ I do n’t know , ”
75265	75324	75261	75261	she	1134	“ I love him , but I feel like my entire life has been strained ever since he proposed . I do n’t feel right , not like myself . I feel trapped in this little box of what ’s expected of me , and now , I think I ’m starting to lose my mind over it . ”
75334	75394	75331	75331	she	1134	“ When we were fighting , I had no one to turn to . Not a parent , not a friend , and I did n’t want to tell Brian because he probably would have used it as fodder as to why I should n’t hang out with you , despite him saying he ’s okay with our relationship . ”
75402	75417	75395	75395	She	1134	“ I ’m starting to realize how much I lost when my parents died . ”
75545	75554	75538	75538	she	1134	“ I just want to go to bed . ”
75555	75558	75538	75538	she	1134	“ Okay . ”
75568	75579	75559	75559	I	0	“ Let me get you situated in the guest room . ”
75585	75602	75582	75582	her	1134	“ No , I do n’t want to be alone . Can I sleep with you ? ”
75642	75656	75657	75657	I	0	“ Uh , do n’t you think that might be a little inappropriate ? ”
75671	75686	75687	75687	she	1134	“ We ’ve done it before . Why would it be any different now ? ”
75777	75785	75798	75798	her	1134	“ Well , you ’re engaged now . ”
75843	75846	75847	75847	I	0	“ But , ”
75855	75866	75847	75847	I	0	“ if that does n’t bother you , then sure . ”
75874	75879	75867	75867	Her	1134	“ It does n’t . ”
75890	75913	75880	75880	I	0	“ Okay , well , great . Let me just lock up and get ready . You know where your toothbrush is . ”
76219	76231	76216	76216	My	0	“ I borrowed a shirt . I hope that ’s okay . ”
76232	76235	76236	76236	I	0	“ Yup , ”
76244	76257	76236	76236	I	0	“ Sorry , do n’t know why that came out like that . ”
76272	76278	76269	76269	I	0	“ Yup , all good . ”
76293	76325	76285	76285	I	0	“ Just going to get ready , and then we can do all the sleeping because I love sleep . It is truly the natural medicine we all need in life . ”
76326	76331	76332	76332	she	168	“ Are you okay ? ”
76339	76345	76332	76332	she	168	“ Great . Real great . ”
76353	76358	76346	76346	I	0	“ Sleepover . Huzzah . ”
76387	76395	76381	76381	I	0	“ So yeah . Brushing teeth now . ”
76534	76547	76531	76531	I	0	“ Uh , Lia , you left your bra hanging in here . ”
76548	76560	76561	76561	she	168	“ I know . I did n’t want to fold it , ”
76565	76575	76561	76561	she	168	“ Okay , but why is n’t it on ? ”
76622	76641	76614	76614	She	168	“ I never wear a bra to bed . Breaker , I ’ve hung my bra there before . ”
76679	76687	76688	76688	she	168	“ Are you sure you ’re okay ? ”
76698	76711	76688	76688	she	168	“ Whoa , hey there , watch out , heh , heh . ”
76719	76729	76712	76712	I	0	“ Hands to ourselves , let ’s remember that . ”

77332	77351	77322	77322	I	0	“ Maybe I ’m just restless , you know , with not having a job at the moment . ”
77352	77370	77402	77402	she	168	“ Are you sure ? Because you ’ve been weird ever since we left the dress shop . ”
77426	77433	77434	77434	I	0	“ Stubbed my toe in there , ”
77441	77444	77445	77445	she	168	“ What ? ”

I mean , I ’m about to get married in four weeks , and it feels almost like a death sentence rather than a thrilling event . And I ’m not sure if that ’s because I ’m mourning my parents or The Beave is ruining the process , but I ’m not having fun . I want to have fun . I want to do things I ’ve never done before . I want to live a life my parents wanted me to live , and I do n’t think I ’ve been doing that . ”

79068	79119	79120	79120	I	0	“ There ’s absolutely nothing I would change . Not your heart and the way you care for the people around you . Not your mind and how you can shift from sassy to intelligent in seconds . Not your soul and the way you carry your scars with pride . ”
79127	79132	79120	79120	I	0	“ You are perfect . ”
79237	79243	79244	79244	she	1186	“ Th - Thank you , ”

80206	80218	80203	80203	I	0	“ Think this is a way to jumpstart my life again ? ”
80247	80251	80252	80252	Breaker	68	“ Good morning , ”
80278	80286	80255	80255	he	68	“ How long have you been up ? ”
80287	80307	80255	80255	he	68	“ About an hour . There ’s coffee warming if you want some . The raspberry kind of course . ”
80308	80325	80326	80326	He	68	“ As if you need to say anything , I could smell it from the bedroom . ”
80413	80419	80401	80401	he	68	“ What are you writing ? ”
80420	80446	80447	80447	He	68	“ The next greatest novel . It ’s about a dragon who slays . . . on the dance floor and out on the battlefield . ”

80464	80467	80401	80401	he	68	“ Obviously . ”
80468	80490	80491	80491	He	68	“ I ’d read the hell out of that , especially if it ’s as riveting as Lovers , Not Brothers . ”
80509	80517	80491	80491	He	68	“ Does your dragon have a name ? ”
80518	80523	80524	80524	I	0	“ Anita Sparkle Claw , ”
80527	80532	80524	80524	I	0	“ She sounds feisty . ”
80533	80557	80558	80558	He	68	“ With one touch of her talon , you ’re transported into ye old ages full of glitter battles and fleshy sword fights . ”
80561	80578	80558	80558	He	68	“ Fleshy sword fights , huh ? I like the sound of that . Very intriguing . ”
80579	80591	80603	80603	he	68	“ I ’ll be sure to send you the rough draft . ”
80610	80618	80603	80603	he	68	“ Seriously , what are you writing ? ”

80629	80634	80624	80624	He	68	“ Care to elaborate ? ”
80635	80675	80603	80603	he	68	“ Well , I ’ve been thinking about how I have n’t been feeling right and , to get myself out of this rut , I came up with a list of things to do before I get married . ”
80676	80682	80712	80712	his	68	“ Like a bucket list ? ”
80683	80695	80624	80624	He	68	“ Yes , but this could be called the knot list . ”
80696	80700	80701	80701	he	68	“ Knot list ? ”
80714	80730	80712	80712	his	68	“ You know , instead of kicking the bucket , I ’m tying the knot . ”
80731	80748	80749	80749	I	0	“ Aah , I ’m following you . Okay , so what ’s on your list ? ”
80768	80787	80760	80760	he	68	“ Well , for one , you ’re already pretty , so no need to worry about that . ”
80799	80826	80788	80788	I	0	“ I want to do something that makes me feel pretty . Something different , and I have an idea . Want to go with me ? ”
80827	80833	80788	80788	I	0	“ Go with you where ? ”
80834	80856	80788	80788	I	0	“ To check off the first item on my list . I want to go today . Get this ball rolling . ”

80900	80912	80888	80888	I	0	“ That ’s okay . I can do this by myself . ”
80921	80942	80913	80913	I	0	“ But some of these I ’m going to need a cohort in . I wo n’t do it alone . ”
80943	80952	80953	80953	he	68	“ Any other day , I ’m free , ”
80956	80963	80953	80953	he	68	“ I ’m there for you . ”

81085	81095	81096	81096	He	68	“ I think you know the answer to that . ”
81104	81118	81096	81096	He	68	“ What ’s it going to be ? Waffles ? Pancakes ? Omelets ? ”
81119	81126	81127	81127	He	68	“ The pickle special , please . ”
81133	81156	81127	81127	He	68	“ If it ’s going to be the pickle special , then you better get your little behind in here and help . ”
81157	81164	81165	81165	I	0	“ But I ’m emotionally spent , ”

81626	81657	81620	81620	I	0	“ And you know they ’re black . How could you forget after that one night you were so wasted , you wore them over your head and passed out . ”
81658	81666	81584	81584	he	68	“ Can we not talk about that ? ”
81667	81688	81623	81623	he	68	“ You brought up underwear . Therefore , I wanted to bring up one of my favorite memories of you . ”

81886	81895	81896	81896	I	0	“ No , but that ’s up there . ”
81907	81958	81896	81896	I	0	“ The day you graduated . I can still see the exuberant hug you gave your brothers while you were in your cap and gown . It was so beautiful to see brothers that connected to each other , that supportive . It made me love you that much more . ”
81962	81988	81959	81959	He	1208	“ I ’ve been very lucky in the brother department , even though they can be pains and they ditch me for their wives now . ”
81989	82001	82002	82002	He	1208	“ Can you blame them ? Have you seen their wives ? ”
82005	82033	82002	82002	He	1208	“ Yeah , I have , and the fact that they got married so close together does n’t really help me because they ’re both still honeymooning . ”
82034	82047	82048	82048	He	1208	“ I ’m pretty sure they ’ll be honeymooning for a while . ”
82057	82075	82048	82048	He	1208	“ I ’m pretty sure you ’re going to be doing the honeymooning pretty quickly as well . ”
82079	82108	82076	82076	I	0	“ Probably not as long . Brian is not that obsessed with me . I ’m guessing he ’ll be the guy who brings work on his honeymoon . ”
82143	82149	82150	82150	I	0	“ Who knows , though , ”
82153	82162	82150	82150	I	0	“ He can be very attentive at times . ”

82212	82224	82206	82206	His	68	“ No way would I let you out of my sight . ”
82240	82259	82237	82237	he	68	“ I mean , my girl . No way would I let my girl out of my sight . ”
82507	82517	82518	82518	I	0	“ Well , your girl would be very lucky , ”
82532	82554	82518	82518	I	0	“ I just do n’t think Brian is that kind of guy . We barely have sex now as it is . ”
82566	82569	82570	82570	he	68	“ What ? ”
82576	82588	82589	82589	I	0	“ Uh , I do n’t know why I said that , ”

82611	82627	82608	82608	I	0	“ Brian just has a lot going on , and I have to respect that . ”
82628	82632	82633	82633	Breaker	68	“ Fuck that , ”
82639	82720	82633	82633	Breaker	68	“ He should be fucking you every chance he gets . He should appreciate the fact that he gets to be with you . That he gets to pleasure you . It should n’t even be a question about whether or not you ’re fucking at night . He should want you every goddamn second of every goddamn hour . And if he ’s not pleasuring you the way he should , then that ’s something you need to discuss . ”

82749	82783	82738	82738	He	68	“ Fuck , if you were my fiancée , my wife , I ’d never let you leave the bedroom . Your voice would be hoarse from every fucking orgasm I gave you . ”
82836	82841	82842	82842	He	68	“ Anyway . . . ”
82849	82865	82842	82842	He	68	“ I should get going . Feel free to stay as long as you want . ”
82866	82869	82870	82870	I	0	“ Okay , ”

83068	83081	83065	83065	Huxley	92	“ This better be fucking good . Lottie is waiting for me . ”
83082	83097	83098	83098	JP	92	“ Kelsey is cooking pancakes naked , so yeah , hurry the fuck up , ”
83121	83171	83113	83113	I	0	“ I need to talk to you guys because I ’m going to do something stupid . I can feel it . I need to come back to work . I need to distract myself with something , anything , please , just let me come back to work . ”
83172	83187	83188	83188	JP	92	“ Uhh . . . the desperation is thick . What ’s going on ? ”
83191	83197	83198	83198	I	0	“ I almost fucked up , ”
83201	83267	83198	83198	I	0	“ Or maybe I did , I do n’t know , but fuck , it ’s not good . It ’s really not good , so please just let me come back to work . I ’ll wear a wig , a fake mustache , I ’ll even do another job . Just anything to get me away from . . . from this hell . ”
83268	83274	83275	83275	JP	92	“ A mustache , huh ? ”
83278	83288	83289	83289	Huxley	92	“ Tell us what the hell is going on , ”
83379	83397	83359	83359	I	0	“ I , uh . . . came to the conclusion that I have feelings for Lia . ”
83405	83421	83422	83422	JP	92	“ I fucking told you he was going to figure it out in a week , ”
83425	83462	83422	83422	JP	92	“ Spending that much time with a girl you ’re harboring feelings for while she attempts to plan a wedding with another man , yeah , that will give you a swift kick to the scrotum . ”
83463	83478	83479	83479	I	0	“ Can we not play the I - told - you - so game ? ”
83482	83487	83488	83488	Huxley	92	“ But we did , ”
83491	83499	83488	83488	Huxley	92	“ We told you this would happen . ”
83500	83525	83422	83422	JP	92	“ Okay , great , wonderful , you two are modern - day matchmakers . Congratulations . Now , can we please move on ? ”
83526	83537	83538	83538	JP	92	“ Glad you can be big enough to acknowledge that , ”
83541	83552	83553	83553	Huxley	92	“ How does this pertain to work and fucking up ? ”
83556	83579	83553	83553	Huxley	92	“ I ca n’t be around her anymore . I need reasons I ca n’t help with the planning of her wedding . ”
83580	83592	83593	83593	JP	92	“ So you ’re just going to crush her like that ? ”
83596	83604	83593	83593	JP	92	“ Dude , that ’s not cool . ”
83605	83615	83616	83616	I	0	“ What the hell am I supposed to do ? ”
83619	83645	83616	83616	I	0	“ I just told her if she was mine , I ’d never let her go . I would fuck her every chance I had . ”
83646	83651	83652	83652	Huxley	92	“ Whoa , what ? ”
83655	83688	83652	83652	Huxley	92	“ Uh , dude , that ’s a bit extreme for not even admitting your feelings . How ? Did you just announce that you ’d fuck her out of the blue ? ”
83689	83692	83693	83693	I	0	“ No . ”
83701	83838	83693	83693	I	0	“ We were talking about the honeymoon phase , and I mentioned how I would n’t let her out of my sight but quickly changed it to my girl . But then , after that , she tells me that she and Brian barely have sex because he ’s tired , and I just fucking lost it . All I could think about was how this lucky son of a bitch was taking advantage of her and how he did n’t deserve her , and I told her that if she was mine , we ’d be fucking all the time , so yeah . . . there you have it . I need to not be around her anymore , and if I could return to work , that would be great . Thank you . ”
83839	83849	83850	83850	Huxley	92	“ You ca n’t come back to work yet , ”
83853	83862	83850	83850	Huxley	92	“ Not until Taylor says it ’s clear . ”
83863	83886	83693	83693	I	0	“ So what am I supposed to do ? Keep being her man of honor when clearly all I want is her ? ”
83887	83909	83910	83910	JP	92	“ You could do some next - level shit and jeopardize her wedding so she does n’t get married at all , ”
83913	83920	83921	83921	Huxley	92	“ Do n’t listen to him , ”
83925	83944	83921	83921	Huxley	92	“ That ’s a terrible fucking idea . Why do n’t you just tell her how you feel ? ”
83945	83948	83949	83949	I	0	“ Please , ”
83952	83992	83949	83949	I	0	“ We all know how that goes . I tell her how I feel , she does n’t feel the same way . She ends up patting me on the shoulder , and then we do n’t talk anymore . ”
83993	84007	83921	83921	Huxley	92	“ Where are you getting your evidence from ? Movies and TV shows ? ”
84008	84015	84016	84016	I	0	“ Of course , where else ? ”
84029	84038	84039	84039	JP	92	“ Probably not your best source of reality , ”
84042	84074	84039	84039	JP	92	“ I think Huxley is right . You tell her , and if she does n’t feel the same way , at least you know , and you can move on . ”
84075	84090	84091	84091	Huxley	92	“ What about that Birdy girl ? Ca n’t you move on with her ? ”
84094	84148	84091	84091	Huxley	92	“ I ’m about to tell her I ca n’t see her anymore because I like someone else , and I do n’t want to lead her on . Also , I ’ve kissed her twice now and felt nothing , and I think it ’s because I want Lia and only Lia . ”
84149	84155	84156	84156	JP	92	“ That much is obvious , ”
84169	84176	84159	84159	I	0	“ So what should I do ? ”
84177	84186	84187	84187	Huxley	92	“ We already told you what to do , ”
84190	84209	84187	84187	Huxley	92	“ Tell Lia how you feel . If you do n’t , you ’re going to regret it . ”
84210	84235	84159	84159	I	0	“ But she ’s on this mission now to do things before she gets married . What am I supposed to do about that ? ”
84236	84267	84268	84268	JP	92	“ Well , if you think she might not feel the same way about you , then help her understand how you ’re a better match for her than Brian , ”
84271	84277	84268	84268	JP	92	“ Yeah , I agree , ”
84282	84291	84278	84278	Huxley	92	“ How do I go about doing that ? ”
84292	84299	84300	84300	JP	92	“ Be everything Brian is not , ”
84303	84332	84300	84300	JP	92	“ Without crossing the line , obviously , you ca n’t go fuck her and be like , see , I fuck you , and Brian does n’t . ”
84339	84354	84336	84336	me	0	“ I would never do that , but I get what you ’re saying . ”
84365	84374	84355	84355	I	0	“ Do you really think it could work ? ”
84375	84382	84383	84383	Huxley	92	“ Never know until you try , ”
84386	84407	84383	84383	Huxley	92	“ And I just want to state for the record one more time about how right we were about this . ”
84408	84414	84415	84415	I	0	“ Shut the fuck up , ”
84424	84429	84415	84415	I	0	“ I hate you . ”
84430	84437	84438	84438	Huxley	92	“ No , you do n’t , ”
84441	84451	84438	84438	Huxley	92	“ You just hate that we ’re always right . ”
84452	84471	84415	84415	I	0	“ Yeah , that too . Okay , Birdy is here for our hike . Got to go . ”
84472	84478	84479	84479	JP	92	“ Be gentle with her , ”
84482	84500	84479	84479	JP	92	“ No , I thought I would kick dirt at her and tell her to get lost . ”
84501	84505	84506	84506	Huxley	92	“ Not recommended , ”
84628	84633	84634	84634	she	118	“ Hey , you , ”
84663	84668	84650	84650	she	118	“ How are you ? ”
84672	84675	84676	84676	I	0	“ Good . ”
84682	84695	84676	84676	I	0	“ Uh , I like your outfit , very themed for birdwatching . ”
84696	84704	84705	84705	She	118	“ I told you it was good . ”
84752	84757	84749	84749	she	118	“ Is everything okay ? ”
84768	84771	84749	84749	she	118	“ No . ”
84772	84780	84791	84791	I	0	“ Oh , what ’s going on ? ”
84781	84787	84788	84788	I	0	“ Come talk with me , ”
84823	84841	84818	84818	she	118	“ I ’ve been a fucking idiot , Birdy , and I dragged you into my idiocy . ”
84842	84848	84849	84849	she	118	“ What do you mean ? ”
84860	84908	84852	84852	I	0	“ I like someone else , and I thought that maybe if I just ignored it , I would n’t think about it . But it ’s become more and more clear that I like this person , and I do n’t want to lead you on . ”
84909	84912	84913	84913	she	118	“ Oh , ”
84933	84945	84913	84913	she	118	“ I ’m guessing it ’s Lia , is n’t it ? ”
84959	84962	84963	84963	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
84967	85005	84963	84963	I	0	“ Like I said , it ’s really fucked up , and I ca n’t pretend the feelings are n’t there while I try to date you at the same time . It would n’t be fair . ”
85006	85011	85012	85012	she	118	“ I appreciate that , ”
85019	85024	85012	85012	she	118	“ Does she know ? ”
85025	85028	85029	85029	I	0	“ No , ”
85033	85039	85029	85029	I	0	“ Not even a clue . ”
85040	85049	85051	85051	her	118	“ Are you going to go for it ? ”
85079	85086	85087	85087	I	0	“ Uh . . . no , ”
85100	85107	85108	85108	she	118	“ I wo n’t say anything , ”
85111	85149	85108	85108	she	118	“ I do n’t care for Brian all that much . I think he ’s a tool , and honestly , I think Lia could do better . I do n’t know what she sees in him . ”
85150	85154	85155	85155	I	0	“ Me either , ”
85159	85166	85155	85155	I	0	“ You should go for it , ”
85170	85179	85167	85167	Birdy	118	“ You two have such a strong connection . ”
85180	85206	85108	85108	she	118	“ That ’s nice of you , but you do n’t have to talk about this . I know it ’s got to be weird . ”
85207	85309	85108	85108	she	118	“ Sure , it ’s weird , and am I disappointed ? Of course . I think you ’re amazing , Breaker , and if you asked me out on a date , I would one hundred percent go , but I also know when a guy is n’t interested or is hung up on someone else . I had a feeling that might be the case . I could just tell by the way you two interacted and the way you spoke about her . Something is there , and I really think you should try to figure it out . ”
85310	85362	85167	85167	Birdy	118	“ But she ’s getting married in four weeks . Does n’t that make me look like a giant ass ? Like I could n’t have figured this out sooner ? Now I ’m going to come swooping in and tell her how I feel ? It does n’t seem appropriate . ”
85363	85398	85108	85108	she	118	“ Not sure there is a standard for an appropriate time to tell someone you love them . But the last thing you want to do is not tell her and regret it forever . ”
85399	85407	85108	85108	she	118	“ That ’s what my brothers said . ”
85408	85427	85108	85108	she	118	“ Did they also say I told you so ? Seems like something they would pick up on . ”
85428	85443	85444	85444	I	0	“ Yeah , pretty sure everyone picked up on it besides Lia and me . ”
85448	85459	85444	85444	I	0	“ Jesus , Birdy , I ’m just so sorry . ”
85460	85465	85108	85108	she	118	“ Do n’t be . ”
85473	85502	85466	85466	She	1229	“ I ’d rather you tell me the truth . Frankly , this might be the most real conversation I ’ve ever had , and I appreciate it . ”
85503	85514	85444	85444	I	0	“ Well , thanks for being so cool about it . ”
85515	85539	85444	85444	I	0	“ Do you still want to go on a hike ? Maybe we can talk about Lia , and I can help you . ”
85540	85549	85466	85466	She	1229	“ You do n’t want to do that . ”
85550	85554	85555	85555	she	1229	“ I do , ”
85559	85593	85555	85555	she	1229	“ I ’m all about true love , and I think you and Lia have that . She just needs to see it too . Plus , I ca n’t waste this outfit . ”
85594	85597	85598	85598	I	0	“ True , ”
85622	85630	85610	85610	I	0	“ Can I give you a hug ? ”
85631	85635	85639	85639	she	1229	“ Of course , ”
85644	85650	85639	85639	she	1229	“ Thank you for understanding . ”
85651	85658	85610	85610	I	0	“ Thank you for being honest . ”
85667	85708	85664	85664	she	1229	“ Now , if you happen to have a single friend who is kind , sweet , does n’t hurt to have some looks , and can be as honest as you , then I would love to meet him . ”
85709	85725	85726	85726	Her	1229	“ You know . . . I just might have someone in mind for you . ”
85731	85734	85726	85726	Her	1229	“ Really ? ”
85745	85762	85735	85735	I	0	“ Yeah , he ’s a former baseball player . What do you think about that ? ”
85763	85772	85773	85773	I	0	“ Um , I say yes , please ! ”
85788	85793	85794	85794	Birdy	118	“ Goldfinch , right ? ”
85797	85802	85803	85803	I	0	“ That ’s right , ”
85812	85823	85824	85824	She	118	“ Look at you getting it after the twelfth time . ”
85827	85849	85824	85824	She	118	“ Well , do n’t say you ca n’t teach me anything . Clearly , I ’m a master at birdwatching . ”
85850	85853	85854	85854	We	1230	“ Clearly . ”
85867	85879	85854	85854	We	1230	“ I ’m irritated that we have n’t seen more variety . ”
85880	85910	85824	85824	She	118	“ Well , you know , the crow and goldfinch have sealed the deal for me on this birdwatching thing . I think I ’m an avid fan forever . ”
85911	85918	85919	85919	I	0	“ Your sarcasm is easily detectable . ”
85928	85969	85919	85919	I	0	“ If this was a real date , I ’d be thoroughly embarrassed by the showing . Here , I ’m taking you on some exotic bird tour , and we find a gaggle of crows and a dozen goldfinches . ”
85970	85983	86022	86022	she	118	“ Could have been worse , could have been just the crows . ”
85984	85988	85919	85919	I	0	“ Very true . ”
86013	86018	86022	86022	she	118	“ Not too bad , ”
86033	86039	86022	86022	she	118	“ Care to join me ? ”
86047	86067	86040	86040	I	0	“ I ’m glad we still went on the hike . I think it ’s helping clear my head . ”
86068	86086	86100	86100	her	118	“ Good , which means you might be ready and open to talk about all things Lia . ”
86087	86097	86098	86098	She	118	“ Ehhh , not sure that ’s the case . ”
86105	86131	86098	86098	She	118	“ Come on , I have some insight . I ’m a girl , and I know Brian . I could give you some pointers . ”
86132	86135	86136	86136	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
86139	86160	86136	86136	I	0	“ I guess that would n’t be too bad to maybe . . . see what you have to say . ”
86161	86169	86170	86170	She	118	“ Glad you ’re open to it . ”
86173	86305	86170	86170	She	118	“ First of all , you need to know Brian ’s weaknesses , and I will tell you right now that communication is one of them . He ’s also a workaholic , he ’s not very thoughtful , and even though he proposed to Lia , it certainly was n’t his idea . It was his mom ’s because she was n’t happy with him not being married yet . Do I think he loves Lia ? Of course , but do I think he could marry anyone ? Also , yes . I do n’t think the ability to deeply love and be in love with someone is in his bones . I ’ve seen it with his girlfriends growing up . They were more like accessories than anything . ”
86306	86352	86353	86353	I	0	“ Yeah , I got that feeling from him . He and Lia started dating not long after she lost both of her parents , and I believe there was comfort in having him around for that type of affection I could n’t give her . ”
86358	86381	86353	86353	I	0	“ Please do n’t say that to anyone . I do n’t want Lia to find out I ’m breaking her trust . ”
86382	86416	86417	86417	I	0	“ Do n’t worry , Breaker . I ’m on your side . I wo n’t say anything . . . especially since you ’re dangling a baseball player in front of me . ”
86420	86427	86417	86417	I	0	“ A good one at that . ”
86428	86493	86170	86170	She	118	“ I ’m counting on it , but seriously , I think one of the best things you can do is be there for her more than you already are . Knowing Brian ’s relational deficits , why not emphasize your strengths in those areas ? She knows you . But is she aware of the man you ’d be in a romantic relationship ? ”
86494	86502	86170	86170	She	118	“ That ’s what my brothers said . ”
86503	86522	86170	86170	She	118	“ Your brothers are smart . And do everything with her , maybe even flirt just a touch . ”
86523	86533	86170	86170	She	118	“ I do n’t want to cross the line . ”
86534	86606	86170	86170	She	118	“ Then do n’t , but you should subtly let her know that you ’re attracted to her . Start hinting at how you feel so that when you do tell her , this is n’t a total shock , and she does n’t have some assumption that you ’re trying to ruin her wedding . Not that I think Lia would process information that way , but just in case . ”
86607	86616	86617	86617	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s actually really smart . ”
86623	86630	86617	86617	I	0	“ Fuck , this feels terrifying . ”
86631	86722	86170	86170	She	118	“ Well , feel free to call me anytime and ask for advice . I think you have a leg up on Brian . The only thing that could hold you back is her fear of facing the truth . And the truth is , I do n’t think she truly loves Brian . I ’ve seen how she interacts with you and how she interacts with him . There ’s warmth when you two are together , a connection . I do n’t see the same thing with Brian . ”
86723	86729	86730	86730	I	0	“ I do n’t either . ”
86741	86765	86730	86730	I	0	“ We ’re going to have to stay in touch , you know . I really appreciate your honesty and help right now . ”
86779	86809	86775	86777	the wrong person	1239	“ Just promise me , when you two get married , because I know it ’s going to happen , invite me and offer me a plus - one . ”
86817	86847	86775	86777	the wrong person	1239	“ I very well might dedicate a toast to you if this all works out . You gave me a bout of confidence I was n’t feeling this morning . ”
86848	86882	86775	86777	the wrong person	1239	“ If you ever need someone to pump you up for overtaking Brian , I ’m your girl . He might have introduced you to me , but he still is an idiot . ”
86883	86893	86894	86894	We	1240	“ Yup , ca n’t disagree with you there . ”
86915	86929	86930	86930	I	0	“ Shall we head back ? The birds are letting us down today , ”
86933	86966	86930	86930	I	0	“ Yes , and we can go over all the ways you can be flirtatious without crossing the line . It ’s time for the Win Your Girl Bootcamp . You in ? ”
86967	86977	87006	87006	Lia	168	“ Teach me all the things , wise one . ”
87479	87486	87475	87475	I	0	“ Hey , I ’m here . ”
87487	87492	87493	87493	she	168	“ In the bedroom , ”
87496	87500	87493	87493	she	168	“ Come here . ”
87677	87684	87685	87685	She	168	“ Holy . . . shit . ”
87695	87701	87692	87692	she	168	“ Do you like it ? ”
87702	87705	87706	87706	I	0	“ Ophelia , ”
87715	87723	87709	87709	I	0	“ Jesus Christ , you look hot . ”
87730	87733	87724	87724	Her	168	“ Really ? ”
87749	87752	87753	87753	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
87757	87801	87753	87753	I	0	“ It ’s a little spunky , but I feel like a new woman with all that hair lifted off me , and I thought the highlights would be fun , but I kept them minimal because I still like my red hair . ”
87860	87889	87850	87850	I	0	“ You look fucking sexy . Not that you did n’t before , but Jesus fuck , Lia . You look so fucking incredible . I love it . ”
87890	87894	87895	87895	she	168	“ Thank you , ”
87905	87932	87895	87895	she	168	“ I sent a picture to Brian , still waiting to hear back from him . I hope he likes it as much as you do . ”
87947	87951	87952	87952	I	0	“ He will , ”
88053	88075	88035	88035	I	0	“ And the outfit , it ’s not too much , is it ? I thought I ’d try something new . ”
88100	88115	88095	88095	I	0	“ No , not at all . You look really fucking amazing , Ophelia . ”
88116	88127	88128	88128	I	0	“ Ooo , two Ophelias . You must really approve . ”
88135	88141	88131	88131	I	0	“ Yeah , I do . ”
88187	88197	88184	88184	I	0	“ But more importantly , how do you feel ? ”
88198	88210	88184	88184	I	0	“ Well , after your reaction , I feel really sexy . ”
88211	88215	88184	88184	I	0	“ You should . ”
88216	88229	88184	88184	I	0	“ I ’m just excited to see what Brian has to say . ”
88269	88300	88263	88263	she	168	“ Speak of the devil . I bet that ’s him . I ’ll answer , and you can divvy out the food . Do n’t hoard the garlic naan . ”
88301	88308	88309	88309	I	0	“ Would n’t dream of it , ”
88459	88464	88465	88465	she	168	“ Hey , Brian , ”
88469	88474	88465	88465	she	168	“ How are you ? ”
88517	88526	88514	88514	her	168	“ What ? You do n’t like it ? ”
88592	88598	88599	88599	she	168	“ I wanted a change , ”
88602	88618	88619	88619	She	168	“ Because I was n’t feeling myself . Yes , I feel like myself now . ”
88628	88638	88619	88619	She	168	“ Brian , can we talk about this later ? ”
88644	88670	88619	88619	She	168	“ For how long ? A week ? I mean , it ’s not like I can stop you , right ? Business is business . ”
88693	88714	88680	88680	I	0	“ Yes , but we ’re supposed to get married shortly . It would be nice if you were here . ”
88724	88736	88737	88737	She	168	“ Okay , fine . Yeah , talk to you later . ”
88811	88823	88824	88824	she	168	“ I ’m sure you got the gist of that conversation , ”
88827	88842	88824	88824	she	168	“ But he did n’t like my hair . Said it was a mistake . ”
88851	88856	88857	88857	I	0	“ He ’s wrong , ”
88870	88911	88857	88857	I	0	“ He ’s so fucking wrong because the moment I saw you , my heart skipped a beat , Lia . You look gorgeous . So fucking stunning that I had to remind myself that you ’re my best friend . ”
88912	88919	88920	88920	She	168	“ You ’re just saying that . ”
88925	88930	88931	88931	I	0	“ I ’m not , ”
88947	88988	88931	88931	I	0	“ I ’d never just say something to appease you . Brian is an idiot because the fact that he ca n’t see how you shine with this new hair , ca n’t see your confidence , is his loss . ”
88989	89001	88934	88934	my	0	“ He thinks his mom is going to be really mad . ”
89019	89022	89023	89023	I	0	“ Good , ”
89026	89043	89023	89023	I	0	“ I hope she is mad . Gives us more fodder to fuck around with her . ”
89048	89095	89096	89096	She	168	“ He ’s also going to be gone for a week , maybe more . I guess what he ’s dealing with in San Jose requires more attention than he initially thought , so that ’s great . Not like we ’re getting married or anything . ”
89099	89117	89096	89096	She	168	“ God , why did he have to be such an ass ? Maybe he ’s stressed . ”
89118	89162	89163	89163	She	168	“ Being stressed does not give anyone an excuse to be a dick . And he was a dick . Flat out . I need you to realize that . What he did was an inexcusable dick move . Do you hear me ? ”
89169	89172	89163	89163	She	168	“ Yes . ”
89173	89208	89163	89163	She	168	“ Good . Now , we ’re going to forget that just happened because we have a fun night planned , and I ’m not going to allow him to ruin that . Understood ? ”
89209	89212	89213	89213	she	168	“ Yes , ”
89266	89274	89275	89275	I	0	“ You ’ve barely touched your naan , ”
89278	89283	89275	89275	I	0	“ That ’s unacceptable . ”
89284	89289	89290	89290	she	168	“ I ’m sorry , ”
89299	89311	89290	89290	she	168	“ I ’m just . . . not in the mood . ”
89312	89323	89275	89275	I	0	“ Is that why we have n’t started playing Plunder ? ”
89324	89334	89275	89275	I	0	“ Maybe I should go back to my place . ”
89335	89349	89350	89350	I	0	“ Yeah , okay , as if I would let you do that , ”
89353	89391	89350	89350	I	0	“ With that frown you ca n’t seem to shake , no way would I allow you to just sulk away . Nah , sorry , you ’re here with me for the rest of the night . ”
89424	89433	89434	89434	she	168	“ I ’m sorry about all of this , ”
89543	89548	89549	89549	I	0	“ Do n’t apologize , ”
89552	89581	89549	89549	I	0	“ I know , but I did n’t even ask you how your date with Birdy was . I just kind of bogarted the night with my issues . ”
89582	89618	89549	89549	I	0	“ You did n’t bogart anything . You have the right to be upset . Brian let you down , and you need to work through those feelings . There ’s nothing to apologize for . ”
89619	89624	89625	89625	She	168	“ Still . . . ”
89631	89638	89625	89625	She	168	“ How was birdwatching with Birdy ? ”
89653	89661	89650	89650	I	0	“ We decided just to be friends . ”
89662	89665	89666	89666	she	168	“ What ? ”
89669	89672	89673	89673	I	0	“ Why ? ”
89677	89690	89673	89673	I	0	“ Just do n’t think I was into it like she was . ”
89691	89709	89650	89650	I	0	“ And she was okay with that ? She said she was so excited about meeting you . ”
89710	89714	89715	89715	I	0	“ She was , ”
89718	89791	89715	89715	I	0	“ We had a real honest conversation about it , actually . She could tell I was n’t feeling it and said it was okay . She ’d rather know now than have me drag things on . We still went on a hike together . Did some talking , and I told her I would hook her up with one of my friends who I think would be perfect for her . ”
89792	89795	89796	89796	she	1270	“ Who ? ”
89805	89808	89799	89799	her	1270	“ Penn . ”
89822	89836	89814	89814	Lia	168	“ Oh my God , Breaker , they would make the cutest couple . ”
89837	89859	89715	89715	I	0	“ I think so , plus Penn is really honest , and is the kind of guy she ’s looking for . ”
89860	89865	89814	89814	Lia	168	“ Is he dating ? ”
89866	89890	89814	89814	Lia	168	“ I think so , just has n’t found anyone he wants to be serious about . I think that could be Birdy . ”
89891	89923	89924	89924	she	168	“ Well , look at you being a matchmaker . I ’m sorry it did n’t work out , though , I thought you were looking for that kind of relationship , ”
89927	89939	89924	89924	she	168	“ I was , but she was n’t what I wanted . ”
89940	89946	89947	89947	she	168	“ What do you want ? ”
89981	89996	89968	89968	I	0	“ Still processing that . I ’ll let you know when I ’m ready . ”
89997	90005	90051	90051	I	0	“ Oh , you have an idea ? ”
90006	90033	89968	89968	I	0	“ Yes , I have an exact idea , but it ’s going to take some finagling , so let ’s put this conversation on pause . ”
90034	90044	89968	89968	I	0	“ Okay , that ’s not evasive at all . ”
90045	90050	90051	90051	I	0	“ Not at all . ”
90064	90069	90056	90056	her	168	“ That ’s annoying . ”
90070	90082	89968	89968	I	0	“ At least we ’ve moved past Brian being a dumbass . ”
90092	90104	90083	90083	She	168	“ He really was being a dumbass , was n’t he ? ”
90105	90130	90056	90056	her	168	“ He was because from where I sit , he ’s completely missed the fact that you ’re a total smokeshow with that hair . ”
90131	90141	90056	90056	her	168	“ Smokeshow , huh ? What was I before ? ”
90142	90146	90147	90147	I	0	“ A smokeshow , ”
90150	90164	90147	90147	I	0	“ But without confidence . This new haircut just makes you shine brighter . ”
90165	90172	90056	90056	her	168	“ I was feeling really confident . ”
90173	90211	90056	90056	her	168	“ He ’s a certified troll for saying anything negative . Bet you he thinks you ’re too hot now , like you ’re out of his league , and he ’s worried you might wander off . ”
90212	90228	90056	90056	her	168	“ Well , if he keeps acting like an ass , I very well might . ”
90258	90323	90249	90249	I	0	“ Are we going to apply to be on Family Feud again this year ? We have Kelsey and Lottie , who we can add to the team , as well as JP , so I think the odds are in our favor . Kelsey would have precise answers , JP would have the funny covered , and Lottie will cover the wildcard topic . ”
90324	90331	90056	90056	her	168	“ We ’ll never get picked . ”
90332	90408	90056	90056	her	168	“ That ’s not the kind of attitude I like to hear . We must manifest this shit . Come on , we were born to be on Family Feud . You and me during fast money ? We ’d annihilate . Steve Harvey would n’t know what to do with himself because we ’d destroy it . And who knows , I ’m not opposed to paying people off to get on the show . ”
90409	90436	90249	90249	I	0	“ I told you , we ’ll get on the show on our own merit , not what number you can write down in your checkbook . ”
90437	90453	90056	90056	her	168	“ Yeah , but the checkbook would be a surefire way to make it happen . ”
90454	90463	90056	90056	her	168	“ Where are your morals , Breaker Cane ? ”
90464	90475	90249	90249	I	0	“ Iffy at best when it comes to Family Feud . ”
90476	90482	90487	90487	she	1272	“ I can see that . ”
90490	90521	90487	90487	she	1272	“ Thanks for hanging out with me tonight , and being my own personal hype man about my hair and my outfit . It truly did make me feel special . ”
90522	90544	90249	90249	I	0	“ Well , you should feel special . Because you are . I ’ll hype you all day , every day . ”
90545	90556	90557	90557	she	1272	“ And that is why you are my best friend , ”
90931	90941	90942	90942	I	0	“ I need to buy some of your cologne , ”
90995	91007	91008	91008	Breaker	68	“ Why do you need to buy some of my cologne ? ”
91018	91031	91008	91008	Breaker	68	“ It smells sublime . I think I want it for myself . ”
91032	91040	91041	91041	he	68	“ You ca n’t wear my cologne , ”
91050	91056	91041	91041	he	68	“ Why the hell not ? ”
91057	91084	91008	91008	Breaker	68	“ Because we ca n’t smell like each other . Besides , I like the smell of your perfume . Viktor & Rolf really suits you . ”
91085	91112	91129	91129	his	68	“ It ’s scary how you remember my perfume . I ’m not sure Brian could even describe the scent to me if I asked him . ”
91113	91125	91126	91126	he	68	“ A subtle combination of rose , jasmine , and orchid , ”
91382	91386	91387	91387	he	68	“ Come on , ”
91395	91412	91387	91387	he	68	“ I ’m starving , and they ’re serving make - your - own breakfast tacos . ”
91443	91449	91450	91450	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
91464	91469	91450	91450	I	0	“ Helping you out . ”
91470	91477	91512	91512	my	0	“ Why would I need help ? ”
91478	91509	91510	91510	I	0	“ Uh , I do n’t know . . . you do n’t wear dresses often , so I was n’t sure if you knew how to walk in one . ”
91527	91541	91510	91510	I	0	“ Ca n’t a guy be a gentleman without being chastised about it ? ”
91542	91556	91557	91557	His	68	“ Ca n’t a girl wear a dress without being teased about it ? ”
91566	91585	91563	91563	he	68	“ You can , and if I did n’t say it before , you look beautiful , Lia . ”
91633	91637	91638	91638	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
91744	91776	91718	91718	he	68	“ You do n’t need a dress to look beautiful . You ’re beautiful in just your flannel shorts and T - shirt , but you also look great in this . ”
91859	91869	91870	91870	he	68	“ Have you ever seen a breakfast taco bar ? ”
91887	91894	91870	91870	he	68	“ Uh . . . no . ”
91895	91947	91948	91948	He	68	“ It ’s fucking mouthwatering . Huxley gets it catered . There are mimosas , Bloody Marys — mediocre ones , of course — a giant fruit display , plus a variety of croissants that I ’m pretty sure will rock your world . They ’ve rocked mine a few times . ”
91953	91972	91973	91973	I	0	“ Yes , that six - pack of yours really tells me how the croissants have rocked you , ”
91994	92003	91985	91985	he	68	“ Notice my six - pack , huh ? ”
92004	92016	92017	92017	He	68	“ The astronauts on the I.S.S. noticed your six - pack . ”
92025	92043	92017	92017	He	68	“ Do n’t flatter me . My ego wo n’t be able to fit through the door . ”
92143	92168	92138	92138	he	92	“ Lia , it ’s great to see you . Been a while since my brother brought you around . Congrats on the engagement . ”
92169	92173	92174	92174	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
92177	92191	92174	92174	I	0	“ And congrats on your wedding as well . Breaker showed me pictures . ”
92192	92199	92200	92200	Huxley	92	“ He should have brought you , ”
92207	92214	92215	92215	Breaker	68	“ Charise was a fine date , ”
92223	92230	92231	92231	Huxley	92	“ Lia would have been better . ”
92247	92257	92231	92231	Huxley	92	“ Everything is on the back patio . Enjoy . ”

92488	92495	92496	92496	he	68	“ Ready to get some tacos ? ”

92633	92642	92627	92627	I	0	“ Breaker said the Bloody Marys are mediocre . ”

92658	92661	92662	92662	JP	92	“ What ? ”

92674	92684	92685	92685	Breaker	68	“ You have no idea what you just did , ”
92688	92694	92695	92695	I	0	“ I have an inkling , ”
92728	92733	92734	92734	Kelsey	113	“ Hey , Lia . ”
92741	92745	92734	92734	Kelsey	113	“ Help yourself . ”
92746	92750	92751	92751	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
92852	92857	92858	92858	I	0	“ This looks amazing , ”
92861	92866	92867	92867	Kelsey	113	“ Take your time , ”
92870	92903	92867	92867	Kelsey	113	“ We ’ll be here for the next few hours , slowly picking away at the buffet . It ’s an event . I would start with two tacos and a drink . ”
92913	92926	92904	92904	Lottie	96	“ Then go for the bowl of fruit as a palate cleanser . ”
92927	92937	92938	92938	Kelsey	113	“ Then a croissant , only one to start , ”
92941	92946	92947	92947	Lottie	96	“ Then some water , ”
92950	92966	92947	92947	Lottie	96	“ Then another taco , then croissant , then fruit . . . then croissant . ”
92967	92978	92979	92979	Kelsey	113	“ Keep it slow and steady on the booze drinks . ”
92985	93004	92979	92979	Kelsey	113	“ I ’m not going to remember that , so I might need you two to guide me . ”
93005	93010	93011	93011	Lottie	96	“ We got you , ”
93027	93054	93011	93011	Lottie	96	“ Meet us over there unless you want to listen to JP drone on for half an hour about how he makes the best Bloody Marys . ”
93055	93064	93065	93065	Kelsey	113	“ He better get it all out now , ”
93068	93082	93065	93065	Kelsey	113	“ I do n’t want to hear about it when we get home . ”
93131	93140	93141	93141	Kelsey	113	“ I ’m so glad Breaker brought you , ”
93144	93167	93141	93141	Kelsey	113	“ We ’re always telling him to bring you , but he says you spend a lot of weekends with your fiancé . ”
93171	93187	93141	93141	Kelsey	113	“ Yeah , he ’s out of town this weekend , so I was free . ”
93188	93196	93197	93197	Lottie	96	“ Well , thank goodness for that , ”
93200	93217	93197	93197	Lottie	96	“ By the way , the knitted potholders you gave us are my favorite thing ever . ”
93218	93222	93223	93223	Kelsey	113	“ Mine too , ”
93226	93257	93223	93223	Kelsey	113	“ I need to know how you made them . I ’ve wanted to pick up a hobby for a while , but I do n’t know where to start . ”
93265	93277	93258	93258	Lottie	96	“ Oh my God , we should start a knitting club . ”
93278	93296	93223	93223	Kelsey	113	“ Do n’t tease me . I ’ve always wanted to be part of a knitting club . ”
93297	93305	93306	93306	Lottie	96	“ Oh , we ’re not teasing . ”
93314	93320	93309	93309	her	96	“ Myla , over here . ”
93423	93428	93400	93400	he	169	“ I want that , ”
93554	93559	93561	93561	she	188	“ Hey , girls . ”
93568	93578	93565	93565	she	188	“ We have n’t met . I ’m Myla . ”
93590	93600	93579	93579	She	188	“ I ’m Lia , Breaker ’s best friend . ”
93601	93617	93581	93581	her	188	“ Oh , I ’ve heard so much about you . Congrats on your engagement . ”
93618	93622	93623	93623	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
93640	93646	93647	93647	Lottie	96	“ Are you not eating ? ”
93660	93663	93651	93651	she	96	“ Please . ”
93669	93693	93651	93651	she	96	“ As if I would skip out on taco bar . Ryot said he ’ll get me a plate and bring it over . ”
93694	93700	93701	93701	I	0	“ That ’s so sweet , ”
93712	93725	93707	93707	her	188	“ That ’s Ryot , always thinking of me first before himself . ”
93731	93736	93728	93728	her	188	“ Even in bed . ”
93744	93769	93737	93737	She	96	“ Girls , last night , I ’m not kidding , I ’m pretty sure I had an out - of - body experience . ”
93770	93778	93779	93779	Lottie	96	“ Please , do share with us , ”
93786	93805	93779	93779	Lottie	96	“ And then we need to solidify this knitting club thing , because I ’m serious about it . ”
93806	93815	93816	93816	Myla	188	“ Ooo , I ’d love to knit , ”
93819	93827	93828	93828	Kelsey	113	“ Then I think it ’s official , ”
93835	93852	93828	93828	Kelsey	113	“ We ’re going to become knitters , and Lia is going to teach us everything . ”
93853	93858	93859	93859	Myla	188	“ Wait . . . ”
93862	93870	93859	93859	Myla	188	“ Did you make those knitted potholders ? ”
93871	93876	93828	93828	Kelsey	113	“ That was me . ”
93877	93891	93828	93828	Kelsey	113	“ Okay , you need to teach me because I love those things . ”
93901	93904	93905	93905	Lottie	96	“ See , ”
93908	94011	93905	93905	Lottie	96	“ They ’re a crowd - pleaser and a much better wedding gift than the crystal orb we got from one of Huxley ’s clients . What the hell are we supposed to do with that ? Huxley wants to pawn it and then donate the money to someone random , like slip it in a card , hand them the card , and leave . I argued that what if that business associate ever came to our house and wanted to see the orb ? We had to keep it . So it ’s stuffed away in a closet . Anyway . ”
94017	94024	94012	94012	Lottie	96	“ Tell us about the sex . ”
94025	94045	94046	94046	I	0	“ Ryot really loves going down on me . I truly think it ’s one of his favorite things . ”
94079	94108	94109	94109	I	0	“ Well , last night , he was sucking on my clit , while he had a vibrator inside me , and I nearly flew off the bed . ”
94119	94123	94124	94124	Kelsey	113	“ You okay ? ”
94131	94136	94124	94124	Kelsey	113	“ Yes , sorry . ”
94144	94150	94124	94124	Kelsey	113	“ Just drank that wrong . ”
94151	94155	94156	94156	I	0	“ You sure ? ”
94183	94224	94124	94124	Kelsey	113	“ Huxley did that to me the other night , easily the best orgasm ever . Sure , I love it when he ’s inside me , of course , but something about his tongue makes me lose my mind . ”
94225	94230	94231	94231	Kelsey	113	“ Same with JP , ”
94234	94262	94231	94231	Kelsey	113	“ But he likes using his fingers over a vibrator , and I do too because he is able to hit me in just the right spot . ”
94263	94270	94271	94271	Myla	188	“ What about you , Lia ? ”
94282	94287	94271	94271	Myla	188	“ Uh . . . ”
94292	94302	94288	94288	I	0	“ Well , Brian , he uh . . . ”
94346	94356	94357	94357	I	0	“ He ’s not much of an oral guy , ”
94377	94385	94386	94386	I	0	“ But we ’re working on that , ”
94400	94423	94386	94386	I	0	“ He ’s busy a lot , so it ’s hard to find time , especially since we do n’t live together . ”
94424	94438	94439	94439	Lottie	96	“ Oh , yes , when you live together , that will change , ”
94455	94458	94446	94446	she	96	“ Totally , ”
94463	94469	94459	94459	Myla	188	“ Living together changes everything . ”
94473	94497	94498	94498	Lottie	96	“ And you wo n’t have Breaker on the other side of the wall anymore , which I ’m sure will be better , ”
94501	94512	94498	94498	Lottie	96	“ I ca n’t imagine what that must be like . ”
94513	94527	94528	94528	Kelsey	113	“ Especially after we ran into that girl who went to your wedding , ”
94538	94544	94535	94535	she	113	“ What was her name ? ”
94545	94548	94549	94549	I	0	“ Charise , ”
94552	94557	94549	94549	I	0	“ That ’s right . ”
94565	94589	94560	94560	her	96	“ Oh my God , she told us she had never in her life had orgasms like the ones she had with Breaker . ”
94594	94630	94631	94631	Kelsey	113	“ She went on forever about it in the grocery store — kind of awkward . She said she really wanted to see him again and asked us to say something . We did n’t , ”
94634	94644	94631	94631	Kelsey	113	“ He ’s not a relationship kind of guy . ”
94645	94652	94653	94653	Lottie	96	“ Makes you think , though , ”
94663	94697	94656	94656	she	96	“ We might have underestimated the youngest Cane brother . He comes off all sweet and charming , but I bet you he ’s the sexiest in bed out of all of them . ”
94698	94704	94705	94705	Myla	188	“ I could see that , ”
94709	94720	94721	94721	Kelsey	113	“ I do n’t think it ’s even a question , ”
94724	94753	94721	94721	Kelsey	113	“ I ’m pretty sure that ’s the case . Just look at him . No man can have those eyes and not fuck someone to their deathbed . ”
94776	94777	94760	94760	I	0	“ Also”—Kelsey
94779	94801	94802	94802	Lottie	96	in—“and you guys have to swear I never told you this , but JP told me a story once about Breaker . ”
94812	94831	94804	94804	her	96	“ Tell us . Breaker has always been a mystery to me . I need to know more . ”
94839	94937	94832	94832	Kelsey	113	“ I ’m sure you know this already , but JP told me he was on a business trip with Breaker once , and he picked up a girl at a bar . He took her back to the penthouse that he was sharing with JP . He said he had never heard a girl come that many times in his life . And it was n’t just in their bedroom . Apparently , Breaker did n’t care about doing her in the kitchen , or on the dining room table , or out on the balcony . ”
94978	94987	94988	94988	Lottie	96	“ With his brother in the other room ? ”
94995	95025	94992	94992	her	96	“ God , that ’s ballsy but really hot . I ’m sort of into that whole people are watching me thing , but of course Huxley would never . ”
95026	95031	95032	95032	Myla	188	“ Neither would Ryot , ”
95035	95051	95032	95032	Myla	188	“ The number of times the man has whispered ‘ mine ’ into my ear . ”
95052	95055	95056	95056	Kelsey	113	“ Same , ”
95059	95076	95056	95056	Kelsey	113	“ JP would rather cut off his own penis than allow anyone to see me naked . ”
95111	95114	95115	95115	Lottie	96	“ Anyway , ”
95118	95133	95115	95115	Lottie	96	“ Back to this knitting club . What do we need to get started ? ”
95197	95231	95187	95187	Breaker	68	“ Fuck , if you were my fiancée , my wife , I ’d never let you leave the bedroom . Your voice would be hoarse from every fucking orgasm I gave you . ”
95260	95270	95254	95254	someone	2072	“ Um , well , we will need yarn . ”
95271	95275	95276	95276	Lottie	96	“ Hold on . ”
95285	95299	95279	95279	her	96	“ I ’m taking notes . We ’re going to make this happen . ”
95315	95317	95303	95305	All the ladies	1334	“ cheers ”
95360	95369	95370	95370	I	0	“ Oh my God , this is good , ”
95376	95395	95396	95396	Lottie	96	“ If I was n’t so concerned about my waistline expanding , I ’d have these every day , ”
95399	95432	95396	95396	Lottie	96	“ Reign is our personal chef , and he spends all afternoon prepping these . He makes sure they ’re piping hot in the morning . And his homemade jam is heaven . ”
95433	95449	95450	95450	Kelsey	113	“ JP is trying to steal Reign , and he asked me to help him , ”
95453	95471	95450	95450	Kelsey	113	“ I told him there was no way I was getting in the middle of that fight . ”
95472	95478	95479	95479	Lottie	96	“ Smart move , sis , ”
95487	95489	95479	95479	Lottie	96	“ You know”—Myla
95492	95516	95517	95517	Lottie	96	croissant—“I might have to ask Ryot to get in the mix of stealing Reign . I have no problem with some friendly competition . ”
95522	95543	95517	95517	Lottie	96	“ Need I remind you that I ’m feisty , and I do n’t mind using my nails as claws . ”
95550	95576	95544	95544	Myla	188	“ Need I remind you that I grew up in a military household where I learned to hold my own . I will destroy you . ”
95577	95583	95584	95584	Lottie	96	“ I have secret rage , ”
95593	95600	95584	95584	Lottie	96	“ That means nothing to me , ”
95608	95612	95613	95613	Kelsey	113	“ You know , ”
95617	95647	95613	95613	Kelsey	113	“ Maybe I ’ll just do you all a favor and steal him for JP , and that way , we do n’t have to see anyone ’s rage . ”
95648	95656	95657	95657	I	0	“ Or I can just take him , ”
95679	95689	95672	95672	Lottie	96	“ I think you ’ll fit in just nicely . ”
95690	95694	95695	95695	Kelsey	113	“ I agree , ”
95698	95704	95695	95695	Kelsey	113	“ I think so too . ”
95832	95843	95844	95844	Kelsey	113	“ You have n’t told us anything about the wedding , ”
95847	95850	95844	95844	Kelsey	113	“ True , ”
95855	95871	95851	95851	Lottie	96	“ The only thing I ’ve heard is how breathtaking you are in your dress . ”
95872	95877	95878	95878	I	0	“ You heard that ? ”
95881	95903	95878	95878	I	0	“ Yeah . Breaker was telling Huxley all about it . I think his exact sentence was she stole my breath . ”
95904	95922	95923	95923	Myla	188	“ Wow , if Breaker said that , I can only imagine what your fiancé will say , ”
95963	95972	95973	95973	I	0	“ I ’m sure he ’ll love it , ”
95997	96003	96004	96004	Kelsey	113	“ Where is the wedding ? ”
96007	96013	96014	96014	I	0	“ The Pier 1905 Club , ”
96017	96033	96014	96014	I	0	“ Brian ’s family are members . The wedding will take place in the gardens . ”
96034	96042	96043	96043	Kelsey	113	“ Oh , that should be pretty , ”
96046	96049	96043	96043	Kelsey	113	“ Yeah , ”
96077	96113	96050	96050	I	0	“ It ’s not my ideal location , but I ’m sort of stuck with it since my soon - to - be mother - in - law is a distant relative of Lucifer himself . ”
96114	96117	96118	96118	Lottie	96	“ Really ? ”
96130	96145	96118	96118	Lottie	96	“ Is she one of those moms who wants to have control over everything ? ”
96146	96169	96050	96050	I	0	“ Yeah . Mother has her quintessential wedding in mind , and none of my ideas are even on Mother ’s radar . ”
96170	96179	96180	96180	Kelsey	113	“ How is she getting away with this ? ”
96183	96188	96180	96180	Kelsey	113	“ Does Brian know ? ”
96189	96247	96050	96050	I	0	“ Oh yeah , he knows , and he ’s completely impervious . He keeps telling me to let his mother make all the decisions because the wedding is n’t a union of love for his family . It ’s more of a horse and pony show . Clearly , I do n’t have the same opinion . ”
96248	96260	96261	96261	Lottie	96	“ Uh , and why is n’t Brian backing you up ? ”
96267	96314	96261	96261	Lottie	96	“ He ’s a mama ’s boy , and I ’m pretty sure he still believes he must do anything to please Mother . Also known as The Beave . He constantly seeks his parents ’ approval , and this is just another instance of that . ”
96315	96322	96323	96323	Kelsey	113	“ Well , that ’s ridiculous , ”
96328	96362	96323	96323	Kelsey	113	“ I like the nickname , though . Your wedding should be one of the most special days of your life , not a day filled with someone else ’s version of love . ”
96363	96435	96436	96436	Kelsey	113	“ I agree . Breaker has been pretty good at helping me keep things from getting too scary . The mother - in - law wanted us to get married in a church , but Breaker helped move it to the garden . The dresses she wanted me to wear were atrocious , and Breaker put his foot down on that too . Honestly , I ’d be lost without him . ”
96452	96463	96464	96464	Kelsey	113	“ It ’s because Breaker always thinks of you first , ”
96468	96506	96464	96464	Kelsey	113	“ He truly cherishes you . I ’m sure he does n’t say all the things to you that he says to us , but you are his number one . There ’s no question about it . ”
96574	96582	96583	96583	Lottie	96	“ Yup , always puts you first , ”
96598	96605	96606	96606	Breaker	68	“ Did you try the croissants ? ”
96622	96626	96627	96627	I	0	“ I did , ”
96641	96646	96627	96627	I	0	“ And . . . ”
96684	96689	96690	96690	I	0	“ They were fantastic , ”
96695	96699	96690	96690	I	0	“ Told you . ”
96707	96749	96700	96700	He	68	“ Seemed like you were having fun with the girls . What ’s this I hear about a knitting club ? And how can I get an invite ? I bet Lottie and Kelsey have no idea the skills I have . ”
96760	96784	96750	96750	His	68	“ Your ability to knit barely registers as a skill . You can knit a line , and that ’s pretty much it . ”
96785	96788	96789	96789	he	68	“ Lies ! ”
96792	96798	96789	96789	he	68	“ I knitted a scarf . ”
96799	96819	96750	96750	His	68	“ Your ‘ scarf ’ was three lines knitted together , and you said it was for a mouse . ”
96820	96858	96750	96750	His	68	“ Yeah , so , mice need to stay warm , too . And maybe if I was invited to the knitting club , I ’d grow my skills into something more , like a knitted hat . ”
96859	96881	96789	96789	he	68	“ Last time I tried to teach you , you pierced the wall with your knitting needle because you were frustrated . ”
96882	96897	96750	96750	His	68	“ The yarn was aggravating me . I ’m better now , less temperamental . ”
96898	96905	96906	96906	He	68	“ Uh - huh , sure . ”
96911	96915	96906	96906	He	68	“ Scoot over . ”

97012	97019	97020	97020	I	0	“ Uh . . . things , ”
97023	97039	97020	97020	I	0	“ Things ? That ’s so descriptive . Wow , I never would have thought . ”
97050	97059	97040	97040	I	0	“ Seriously , what did you talk about ? ”
97060	97072	97093	97093	his	68	“ The wedding and how you seem to care about me . ”
97073	97080	97081	97081	He	68	“ I do care about you . ”
97096	97123	97081	97081	He	68	“ You ’re important to me . Did you tell them how I ’ve been your knight in shining armor when it comes to The Beave ? ”
97124	97135	97093	97093	his	68	“ In so many words but not quite that eccentric . ”
97136	97162	97208	97208	his	68	“ I think it ’s important to know that I ’ve been the hero of this journey down the aisle . It ’s vastly important . ”
97163	97167	97081	97081	He	68	“ To whom ? ”
97168	97172	97093	97093	his	68	“ The world . ”
97173	97179	97208	97208	his	68	“ You ’re so ridiculous . ”
97180	97196	97081	97081	He	68	“ Maybe , but you were the one who made me the Pickle of Honor . ”
97197	97204	97205	97205	I	0	“ How could I possibly forget ? ”
97248	97264	97208	97208	his	68	“ I ’d hope that you would n’t . Did you talk about anything else ? ”
97265	97270	97271	97271	I	0	“ A few things , ”
97274	97291	97271	97271	I	0	“ But nothing I want to talk about in the backyard of your brother ’s house . ”
97292	97301	97208	97208	his	68	“ Okay , shall we leave , then ? ”
97302	97317	97208	97208	his	68	“ We do n’t have to . I mean , it ’s nothing important . ”
97318	97370	97271	97271	I	0	“ Yeah , but if we stay any longer , JP will make me drink another Bloody Mary , and I do n’t think I can stomach it . I nursed the one he gave me two hours ago and then dumped it in a bush when they were n’t looking . ”
97371	97378	97379	97379	He	1359	“ No , you did n’t . ”
97394	97412	97379	97379	He	1359	“ That one , right there , if it starts to die , we will know why . ”
97413	97428	97271	97271	I	0	“ Aah , just another secret I ’ll have to hang over your head . ”
97432	97435	97436	97436	Breaker	68	“ Okay . ”
97449	97462	97443	97443	his	68	“ Give me all the dirt . What did you talk about ? ”
97565	97575	97576	97576	I	0	“ It ’s really not that big a deal , ”
97593	97624	97576	97576	I	0	“ It has to be a big deal if you did n’t want to talk about it in Huxley ’s backyard . So spill , Lia , what is it ? ”
97625	97659	97667	97667	he	68	“ God , you ’re annoying . Fine , but you ca n’t tease me or make fun of me about it , okay ? I ’m sort of sensitive about the topic . ”
97660	97663	97664	97664	he	68	“ Okay , ”
97675	97680	97664	97664	he	68	“ What is it ? ”
97681	97706	97667	97667	he	68	“ Well , Myla started the conversation off with how , uh . . . her and Ryot were . . . enjoying themselves . ”
97707	97711	97712	97712	Breaker	68	“ Having sex ? ”
97715	97754	97712	97712	Breaker	68	“ Yes , having sex . And before you say that ’s not a big deal , it is a big deal because we normally do n’t talk about those things , so I feel weird , okay ? ”
97755	97758	97759	97759	he	68	“ Okay , ”
97782	97853	97767	97767	he	68	“ So she was talking about how Ryot is really good at giving . . . oral , and then Kelsey and Lottie chimed in . I just felt weird because Brian really does n’t do that , and when I try to give him . . . that , he pushes me away and says that . . . well , that I ’m not that great at it . ”
97854	97861	97862	97862	Breaker	68	“ He said that to you ? ”
97871	97919	97865	97865	his	68	“ Not precisely with those words , but yeah . And I do n’t know , listening to them talk about their sex lives , it made me think that maybe I need to step it up , you know ? Maybe I need to try harder . ”
97920	97923	97924	97924	he	68	“ Doubtful , ”
97930	97943	97924	97924	he	68	“ You do n’t know that . Maybe I suck in bed . ”
97944	97947	97948	97948	he	68	“ Ophelia , ”
97955	97963	97951	97951	his	68	“ You would n’t suck in bed . ”
97964	98009	97951	97951	his	68	“ You do n’t know that . For all we know , I could be a real dead fish . I mean , I thought I knew what I was doing when it came to a blow job , but maybe I do n’t . ”
98016	98032	98033	98033	He	68	“ Like . . . what do you enjoy when a woman is down there ? ”
98042	98048	98033	98033	He	68	“ Every guy is different . ”
98049	98081	98082	98082	He	68	“ But it ’s a mouth on your penis . I ’m pretty sure any guy enjoys a mouth on their penis , so . . . what do you like ? ”
98154	98262	98144	98144	He	68	“ You know what , never mind . This was stupid . I should n’t have brought it up . It ’s just that I do n’t think my sex life is good , and should n’t it be good right before I get married ? Should n’t we be having sex all the time ? Phone sex even ? We just . . . are n’t . He goes to bed and does n’t even spoon me . I keep telling myself it ’s because he ’s exhausted from work , but . . . Huxley and JP and Ryot are tired , but they still — ”
98263	98277	98278	98278	he	68	“ I like when the girl plays with the tip slowly at first , ”
98315	98367	98313	98313	Drawn	195	“ I like to be teased , taunted , unsure if I ’ll be granted permission to enter her mouth . I like it when she drags her tongue around the head , then flicks the underside over and over until I ’m so hard , I ’m aching for more . ”
98376	98465	98372	98372	I	0	“ I love cupping her cheek to show her that if she wants to take me , I want her to . And when she does suck me into her warm , wet mouth , I love watching her eyes , seeing them water , seeing how she can take me all the way back to her throat . And as she ’s pumping me in and out , I fucking beg for the lightest drag of her teeth over my length , just enough to tantalize me . ”
98466	98469	98470	98470	I	0	“ Oh , ”
98510	98523	98494	98494	him	1366	“ And , uh . . . that will make you orgasm ? ”
98524	98527	98528	98528	he	1366	“ Hard , ”
98531	98554	98528	98528	he	1366	“ And I prefer my girl to swallow , as I like watching her throat work while I stiffen in her mouth . ”
98622	98626	98612	98613	the girls	551	“ I see . ”
98631	98638	98627	98627	I	0	“ Well , that was informative . ”
98639	98655	98656	98656	he	1366	“ What do you like when it comes to a guy going down on you ? ”
98659	98679	98656	98656	he	1366	“ Umm , well . . . I ’m not quite sure because Brian does n’t really do that . ”
98680	98684	98690	98690	his	1366	“ I would , ”
98706	98818	98703	98703	he	1366	“ I ’d go down on my girl . Because I ’m desperate to taste her , please her , and drive her wild , I ’d slowly spread her legs and work my way up her inner thighs , teasing her . I ’d drop kisses over every inch until I could see her dripping for me . Ready for my tongue to devour her . Her clit would be so hard I ’d be able to flick it with my tongue . She ’d be panting , nearly breathless . My fingers would widen her lips so I could drag my tongue over her clit in one long stroke . ”
98828	98832	98703	98703	he	1366	“ That ’s , uh”—I
98836	98841	98703	98703	he	1366	together—“that would be nice . ”
98842	98954	98955	98955	My	0	“ That would be only the beginning . I love to hear my girl scream , to pull on my hair , to dig her heels so far into my back that I feel it the next day . I love to suck on her clit , taste her , pulse my fingers into her , and make my face sloppy with her arousal . And then , I like to do it all over again . I take . I fucking take every last ounce of pleasure from her , and then that ’s when I let myself come when I know that she has nothing left to give me . ”
98979	98995	98973	98973	I	0	“ Well , that , uh , that is not the way Brian does it . ”
99000	99017	98973	98973	I	0	“ So this was educational . Maybe I should try the whole tongue - flicking thing . ”
99018	99026	99027	99027	he	1368	“ Do you want to try it ? ”
99030	99036	99027	99027	he	1368	“ What do you mean ? ”
99037	99047	98973	98973	I	0	“ Do you want to go down on Brian ? ”
99048	99062	99150	99150	she	1369	“ I mean , is n’t that what I ’m supposed to do ? ”
99063	99142	99150	99150	she	1369	“ You ’re not supposed to do anything . But when a woman goes down on me , it ’s because she wants to , because she finds my cock so enticing that she ca n’t function without tasting me . I want my girl to be desperate , needy , and begging for me , so when she does take me in her mouth , she worships it . Just like I would worship her aching pussy . ”
99246	99255	99256	99256	I	0	“ Well , I want to pleasure him , ”
99259	99272	99256	99256	I	0	“ I think everyone wants to be able to pleasure their partner . ”
99293	99301	99302	99302	he	1370	“ What do you do with him ? ”
99384	99396	99397	99397	I	0	“ Uh , what do I do with Brian ? Well . ”
99423	99428	99415	99415	I	0	“ We obviously kiss . ”
99429	99435	99436	99436	he	1370	“ That ’s a given , ”
99477	99492	99473	99473	he	1370	“ And you know , touch each other . He fondles my breasts and , uh”—I
99493	99522	99473	99473	he	1370	swallow—“I touch his balls and penis . But , we kind of just get into it , you know ? He really likes to fuck me from behind . ”
99558	99569	99555	99555	his	1370	“ Does he spank you while he ’s fucking you ? ”
99570	99573	99574	99574	My	0	“ What ? ”
99583	99592	99578	99578	I	0	“ No . He ’s never spanked me . ”
99593	99604	99619	99619	his	1370	“ Shame . Bet you would get wet from it . ”
99608	99615	99616	99616	he	1370	“ Do you strip for him ? ”
99652	99659	99633	99633	I	0	“ I did a few times . ”
99660	99664	99694	99694	his	1370	“ Lap dance ? ”
99665	99691	99692	99692	Breaker	68	“ Uh , not really . But I have purchased some lingerie that I know he liked . It was black see - through lace . ”
99700	99707	99694	99694	his	1370	“ That ’s hot , Lia . ”
99708	99711	99712	99712	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
99720	99794	99712	99712	I	0	“ Very hot . I love when my girl wears lingerie . I love when she wants to dress up for me , show me her body , grind on me . It ’s all about the teasing , so even if you ’re not comfortable at giving a lap dance , trust me , if you were in lingerie and just lightly grinding on my dick , I ’d be fucking ecstatic . ”
99795	99809	99838	99838	he	1375	“ But . . . what do I do , just sit there ? ”
99810	99834	99835	99835	he	1375	“ And move your hips . It ’s his job to further the moment by running his hands up your thighs like this , ”
99862	99865	99866	99866	I	0	“ Oh , ”
99870	99991	99866	99866	I	0	“ And he ’s supposed to smooth his hand over your stomach , especially if you ’re facing the other direction , your back to his chest . He ’s supposed to attempt to touch your breasts but not really touch them . He ’s supposed to get close , to run his finger along the underside but pull away . He ’s supposed to turn you on so much that when he moves his hand back down your stomach and plays with the waistband of your underwear that your legs part even wider . You should be wet , throbbing , so turned on that you ’re ready to come when he slips his fingers right against your clit . ”
100053	100059	100044	100044	Breaker	68	“ Does he finger you ? ”
100060	100067	100068	100068	I	0	“ Umm . . . sometimes , ”
100071	100083	100068	100068	I	0	“ Does he suck on his fingers after he fingers you ? ”
100084	100094	100044	100044	Breaker	68	“ Uh , no , that ’s not Brian . ”
100095	100103	100104	100104	Breaker	68	“ That ’s the best fucking part , ”
100112	100135	100107	100107	he	68	“ I love tasting a woman . I love having the flavor of her on my tongue as I drive into her . ”
100136	100147	100148	100148	I	0	“ Oh , yeah , Brian has not done that , ”
100162	100187	100152	100152	I	0	“ How does he fuck you ? Does he tie you down ? Does he let you ride him ? Does he use toys ? ”
100210	100238	100239	100239	I	0	“ Just regular , you know , nothing too fancy . Like , we do , uh , different positions , but nothing outside of that realm . ”
100246	100252	100239	100239	I	0	“ This is so embarrassing . ”
100253	100256	100257	100257	he	68	“ Why ? ”
100267	100291	100257	100257	he	68	“ Because clearly you ’re more voracious in bed , and I look like a basic , vanilla bean girl compared to you . ”
100292	100309	100355	100355	Breaker	68	“ Do n’t compare yourself . That ’s the first way to make yourself feel bad . ”
100310	100354	100355	100355	Breaker	68	“ It ’s hard not to compare when discussing toys and tying up . And then the girls earlier with all their talk about how their men like going down on them . Maybe . . . maybe something is wrong with me . ”
100370	100400	100367	100367	he	68	“ Nothing is wrong with you . Fucking nothing . It ’s all about chemistry and maybe . . . maybe you just do n’t have that with Brian . ”
100412	100429	100407	100407	he	68	“ Tying you up , using toys , is that the kind of stuff you want ? ”
100430	100455	100367	100367	he	68	“ I do n’t know what I want , I just . . . I think I want more than what I have now . ”
100456	100461	100462	100462	he	68	“ You deserve more , ”
100470	100493	100462	100462	he	68	“ Your pussy deserves to be tongued , consumed , and fucked so hard that you ca n’t walk the next day . ”
100509	100524	100465	100465	his	68	“ You ’re so fucking sexy , Lia , and if it were me — ”
100579	100584	100585	100585	I	0	“ Who is that ? ”
100597	100601	100585	100585	I	0	“ No idea . ”
100668	100681	100663	100663	him	68	“ Oh , hey . Uh , what are you doing here ? ”
100682	100687	100663	100663	him	68	“ Is Lia here ? ”
100713	100725	100726	100726	He	68	“ Brian , I thought you were on your business trip . ”
100736	100765	100726	100726	He	68	“ I was , but I did n’t like our last conversation , so I returned for the night . I have to leave first thing tomorrow morning . ”
100766	100769	100770	100770	I	0	“ Oh . ”
100786	100796	100797	100797	His	68	“ Can we go to your place , please ? ”
100801	100819	100820	100820	I	0	“ Yeah , can you just give me one second ? I ’ll meet you over there , ”
100828	100831	100832	100832	Brian	100	“ Sure . ”
100837	100845	100832	100832	Brian	100	“ Good to see you , man . ”
100846	100852	100853	100853	Breaker	68	“ Yeah , you too , ”
100889	100895	100872	100872	I	0	“ So Brian ’s home . ”
100896	100900	100901	100901	I	0	“ He is , ”
100904	100909	100901	100901	I	0	“ That was unexpected . ”
100910	100913	100914	100914	Breaker	68	“ Very . ”
100933	100943	100925	100925	I	0	“ So you should probably go talk to him . ”
100999	101006	101007	101007	I	0	“ Yeah , I probably should . ”
101022	101031	101019	101019	I	0	“ Should I talk to him about sex ? ”
101042	101060	101039	101039	he	68	“ I mean , if you want to . If you think it ’s a good time . ”
101061	101082	101039	101039	he	68	“ I think it needs to be said , do n’t you ? We ’re getting married in four weeks . ”
101083	101088	101089	101089	he	68	“ That you are , ”
101098	101120	101089	101089	he	68	“ Yes , Lia , go tell him what you desire , and do n’t be afraid to tell him everything . ”
101145	101190	101133	101133	He	68	“ Tell him you want his tongue between your legs . Tell him you want him to tease you , to taunt you , to make you feel so goddamn wet that you could just come from him rolling your nipples between his fingers . ”
101208	101254	101205	101205	he	68	“ Tell him you want him to fuck you . To fuck you so mercilessly that you ca n’t take the constant hammering of his dick inside you until you come so hard that you ca n’t think of sex any other way but carnal . ”
101344	101355	101356	101356	I	0	“ What if he does n’t want to fuck me ? ”
101389	101420	101386	101386	he	68	“ Then he ’s not the man for you because , Lia . . . you deserve to be fucked . Just like you deserve to be worshiped . Hard . ”
101436	101446	101447	101447	JP	92	“ Dude , did n’t you just leave us ? ”
101466	101480	101455	101455	I	0	“ Uh , come in . Not like I ’m doing anything important . ”
101481	101489	101490	101490	I	0	“ Where are your disgusting Bloody Marys ? ”
101499	101518	101519	101519	JP	92	“ Uh , if you recall , the brunch was over at Huxley ’s . He has everything , ”
101529	101546	101519	101519	JP	92	“ Then where ’s your alcohol ? I know you have some . Where is it ? ”
101547	101560	101561	101561	He	92	“ Okay , I need you to slow down for a second . ”
101569	101576	101561	101561	He	92	“ Why are you all jittery ? ”
101577	101586	101587	101587	I	0	“ Just give me fucking alcohol , okay ? ”
101606	101612	101613	101613	Kelsey	113	“ What ’s going on ? ”

101700	101705	101681	101681	he	92	“ Will this do ? ”
101706	101723	101724	101724	Kelsey	113	“ Yes , whatever , I do n’t care . Just give me something , anything . ”

101906	101911	101814	101814	I	0	“ Yes , unfortunately . ”
101912	101930	101931	101931	I	0	“ Well , that pain you were feeling , that ’s what I ’m feeling right now . ”
101937	101940	101931	101931	I	0	“ Fuck . ”
101941	101947	101948	101948	Kelsey	113	“ Where is Lia now ? ”
101951	101960	101948	101948	Kelsey	113	“ At home . . . with Brian . ”
101971	102016	101961	101961	I	0	“ And the worst thing about it all is because thanks to your little girl chat at brunch , she was asking me all about sex because apparently Brian is a real fucking dud in the bedroom and does n’t go down on her . ”
102017	102020	102021	102021	JP	92	“ What ? ”
102026	102043	102021	102021	JP	92	“ That ’s like the best fucking part , making your girl come on your tongue . ”
102044	102066	102067	102067	I	0	“ That ’s what I said , and she was asking for advice on how to give a good blow job . ”
102082	102143	102074	102074	JP	92	“ And I fucking told her how to give a good one . Right there , I told her everything , so now she ’s over at her place , probably kneeling in front of Brian , the fucking douche , sucking his dick , because I ’m the goddamn asshole who told her how to do it . Fuck ! ”
102162	102173	102174	102174	JP	92	“ Wow , there ’s a lot to unpack there , ”
102177	102192	102174	102174	JP	92	“ You really taught her how to give a good blow job ? Why ? ”
102193	102307	102308	102308	I	0	“ I do n’t know , because I lost my mind . Because I ca n’t look her in the eyes and see the sadness Brian puts there . Because I could n’t let her feel bad about herself when she ’s clearly trying , and he ’s not . So yeah , I told her how to please him , and now that they ’re in her apartment , I could n’t stay there . I could n’t listen to her pleasure him . There was no fucking way , when all I want is for her to be with me . I mean , Jesus Christ , I was doing fine , ”

Why could n’t I have figured this out a year ago ? A month ago , anytime where there was n’t a countdown to doomsday when she attached herself to another man who does not fucking deserve her ? Not even close . ”
102395	102413	102414	102414	JP	92	“ To be fair , Huxley and I have been telling you for years you like Lia , ”
102425	102433	102422	102422	Kelsey	113	“ JP , that ’s not helpful . ”
102434	102460	102487	102487	his	92	“ Was n’t trying to be helpful , was trying to make a point , like I ’ve been trying to make for years now . ”
102461	102467	102468	102468	I	0	“ You ’re an asshole , ”

102491	102564	102487	102487	his	92	“ Do you want me to hold your hand and tell you everything will be okay ? That we ’ll always know you as the better man ? News flash , man , she ’s getting married . And if you do n’t do something about it , then she ’s going to go off with the douche , and you ’re going to be left to die alone in your apartment . ”
102565	102570	102571	102571	Kelsey	113	“ Seriously , JP , ”
102574	102580	102571	102571	Kelsey	113	“ You ’re being rude . ”
102581	102599	102487	102487	his	92	“ I ’m being real . If he wants her , then he needs to tell her . ”
102600	102607	102608	102608	Kelsey	113	“ No , he ca n’t , ”
102614	102651	102608	102608	Kelsey	113	“ Trust me , if he just knocks on her door and tells her he loves her , she wo n’t take it well . He needs to continue to show her how he ’s better . ”
102652	102700	102487	102487	his	92	“ That ’s not working out for him . Lia is giving the other guy a blow job because my idiot brother taught her the tricks of the trade . Were you trying to turn her on ? Were you trying to be all sexy - like ? ”
102701	102710	102711	102711	I	0	“ Do n’t fucking say sexy - like , ”
102714	102756	102711	102711	I	0	“ And it was a hot moment , okay ? I saw her cheeks blush . I was showing her that I ’m the kind of man who ’d make her orgasm several times in one night , not stupid Brian . ”
102757	102767	102487	102487	his	92	“ And how did that work out for you ? ”
102768	102773	102487	102487	his	92	“ Not fucking well , ”
102784	102864	102774	102774	I	0	“ I think Kelsey is right , though , I do n’t think I can just tell her . I feel her questioning him , questioning herself . But fuck . . . she ’s also the person who does n’t like to give up . So she ’ll do anything to make it work , and I bet that ’s what she ’s doing tonight . Maybe . . . maybe I can fake getting hurt or something . ”
102869	102918	102865	102865	I	0	“ Yeah , like , I can break a leg or something , and then you guys can call her and tell her I ’m in the hospital , and that will drag her away from Brian tonight , and she wo n’t give him a blow job . ”
102919	102927	102487	102487	his	92	“ Are you hearing yourself right now ? ”

102944	102999	102933	102933	I	0	“ This is a great idea because it will gather me sympathy , and she ’ll want to take care of me of course because that ’s who she is , and when she ’s taking care of me , I can move in more , steal her from Brian . This is genius . ”
103000	103052	103053	103053	JP	92	“ This is stupid because if you break your leg , how the hell are you supposed to run away when Brian finds out what you did ? The guy might be a douche , but that man has simmering rage , and I think he could be a good fight , ”
103056	103076	103077	103077	Kelsey	113	“ Uh , besides all of that , breaking a leg is not the way to get the girl , ”
103080	103089	103077	103077	Kelsey	113	“ God , you guys are such idiots . ”
103090	103109	103110	103110	I	0	“ Breaking my leg is the best idea so far . What else should I do ? Oh ! ”
103115	103129	103110	103110	I	0	“ I can tell her I got food poisoning from the Bloody Mary . ”
103130	103136	103137	103137	JP	92	“ The fuck you will , ”
103140	103151	103137	103137	JP	92	“ Do n’t fucking taint me for your own benefit . ”
103152	103175	103110	103110	I	0	“ That ’s the only thing I had that she did n’t , and food poisoning will drag her away from Brian . ”
103176	103194	103195	103195	JP	92	“ Uh - huh , and how do you suppose you throw up in front of her ? ”
103204	103210	103198	103198	I	0	“ Have any raw chicken ? ”
103211	103217	103218	103218	Kelsey	113	“ For God ’s sake , ”
103251	103261	103244	103244	she	113	“ You ’re not going to do anything tonight — ”
103262	103265	103226	103226	She	113	“ But — ”
103266	103389	103244	103244	she	113	“ If she happens to give him a blow job , then so be it . That ’s the price you pay for trying to show her how you enjoy one . But what you need to remember is that she heard everything you said . She listened intently , and if I know Lia like I think I do , that will stick in her mind . Every time she looks at you , she ’s going to think about how you like to be sucked , how you like to be between a female ’s legs , and how easily you can please a woman . She will remember that , and that ’s the new foundation you work off . ”
103390	103405	103406	103406	Kelsey	113	“ Babe , seriously , keep talking like that and we ’re going upstairs . ”
103414	103454	103406	103406	Kelsey	113	“ Unless you start being helpful to your brother , who clearly is in agony , then I wo n’t be going upstairs anytime soon . He loves her , JP , and he deserves to be with her . ”
103465	103548	103457	103457	her	113	“ This is go - time , Breaker . Forget about what happens between Brian and Lia . Act like he never came home and charge forward . Trust me , we spoke about you in our little girls ’ gathering , and there ’s intrigue there , and it ’s not best friend intrigue . I think you have a chance , but you need to do this right . Brian will falter . He already has , so be patient . ”

103561	103608	103556	103556	I	0	“ She will break before that , trust me . Between you and Brian , you have the history , the sex appeal , and the ability to make her happy . She ’ll see that quickly . Brian is a blip . You are forever . ”

103666	103676	103663	103663	I	0	“ You really think Lia and I are forever ? ”
103677	103714	103663	103663	I	0	“ If anything , Breaker , I love love , and I would never mess with that . I truly believe you and Lia are soulmates . I ’m just glad you ’re seeing it now . ”

103722	103730	103719	103719	I	0	“ So what do I do now ? ”
103731	103750	103751	103751	JP	92	“ Well , when I was spiraling , I decided to donate money to make me feel better , ”
103754	103768	103751	103751	JP	92	“ I know of a great pigeon rescue that could use another donor . ”

103850	103862	103863	103863	Brian	100	“ It was fine . Got some work done , thankfully , ”
103892	103906	103878	103878	Ca	114	“ Well , uh , are you hungry ? I can order food . ”
103907	103917	103918	103918	His	92	“ I just really want to talk to you . ”
103957	103962	103948	103948	He	92	“ Is everything okay ? ”
103963	103969	103981	103981	he	92	“ What do you mean ? ”
103970	103977	103978	103978	he	92	“ Here , let ’s sit , ”
104003	104035	104000	104000	he	92	“ I know the wedding planning has been stressful on you , and I ’m worried that maybe you ’re not handling it all well , hence the haircut and color . ”
104039	104066	104000	104000	he	92	“ What do you mean ? I cut my hair and highlighted it because I wanted to , not because of the stress of the wedding . ”
104067	104070	104071	104071	he	92	“ Lia , ”
104078	104163	104071	104071	he	92	“ I ’ve known you for over a year now , and you ’ve never made such a drastic change like this before . I ’m just worried the stress is overwhelming , your parents are n’t around , you ’re trying to find some semblance of control , and your appearance is the one thing you feel you can control . So you cut your hair . I ’m worried this pattern will continue , and who knows what you will do next . ”
104210	104258	104195	104195	he	92	“ Brian , it ’s a haircut . It ’s not like I went off and tattooed a penis on my face . And my decision to do this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me . I wanted to feel pretty . ”
104259	104274	104195	104195	he	92	“ You were just fine before . There ’s no need to change anything . ”
104275	104279	104280	104280	I	0	“ Just fine ? ”
104288	104305	104306	104306	He	92	“ I was just fine before ? Could n’t think of a better adjective than that ? ”

104328	104367	104322	104322	He	92	“ It ’s been a long day . I ’ve been worried about you , and getting this flight was hard , so excuse me if my words are not what they ’re supposed to be right now . ”
104368	104390	104419	104420	Good God	103	“ I need your words to not be condescending , and I do n’t think that ’s too much to ask . ”
104391	104399	104400	104400	he	92	“ Where is this all coming from ? ”
104403	104413	104400	104400	he	92	“ I feel like you ’re angry with me . ”
104422	104429	104430	104430	I	0	“ I am angry with you , ”
104433	104477	104430	104430	I	0	“ Jesus , Brian . This whole wedding and dealing with your mom and your reaction to my hair , it ’s been a nightmare . And you . . . you never want to have sex with me . Why is that ? ”
104485	104491	104492	104492	he	92	“ Yes , I do , ”
104495	104547	104492	104492	he	92	“ No , you do n’t . We have n’t had sex in two weeks . Do n’t you think that ’s weird ? Do n’t you think we should be at each other ’s bodies every chance we get , peeling off our clothes and finding pleasure in each other ? ”
104548	104560	104601	104601	his	92	“ It ’s been a rough couple of weeks , Lia . ”
104561	104584	104601	104601	his	92	“ We did n’t even have sex the night you proposed . I fell asleep while you were on a business call . ”
104585	104597	104601	104601	his	92	“ With clients from Japan . What choice do I have ? ”
104606	104643	104601	104601	his	92	“ You have a choice , and it ’s called me , but you do n’t choose me . Am I just some sort of . . . accessory to your life check - off list ? ”
104644	104649	104650	104650	he	92	“ No , Lia , ”
104660	104673	104653	104653	he	92	“ I love you . You ’re going to be my wife . ”
104674	104687	104601	104601	his	92	“ Then why do n’t you want to have sex with me ? ”
104688	104692	104693	104693	he	92	“ I do , ”
104703	104718	104693	104693	he	92	“ It ’s just . . . it ’s been hard lately , okay ? ”
104719	104752	104601	104601	his	92	“ Are you . . . are you cheating on me ? Are you getting sex somewhere else , and that ’s why you do n’t want to do it with me ? ”
104753	104756	104757	104757	he	92	“ Lia , ”
104761	104781	104757	104757	he	92	“ Do n’t even fucking say that . You know that ’s not the kind of man I am . ”
104840	104848	104849	104849	I	0	“ I know . I ’m sorry , ”
104859	104888	104849	104849	I	0	“ Do you think we ’re in some sort of rut ? I mean , you do n’t even like it when I give you a blow job . ”
104889	104923	104940	104940	his	1395	“ I ’ve never liked them , Lia . It ’s not just you . I feel bad when a girl has to just sit there and suck on my dick , okay ? ”
104924	104932	104933	104933	I	0	“ But what if I wanted to ? ”
104953	104974	104943	104943	He	1395	“ I still feel like it ’s demeaning . You deserve better than to have to pleasure me like that . ”
104975	104981	104982	104982	I	0	“ It ’s not demeaning , ”
104985	104999	104982	104982	I	0	“ It ’s a way to show your partner how you love them . ”
105005	105012	105002	105002	his	1395	“ It ’s demeaning to me . ”
105013	105033	104943	104943	He	1395	“ Okay , then what about like . . . spanking or toys ? We ’ve never tried that . ”
105034	105062	105002	105002	his	1395	“ Because we do n’t need that kind of fanfare . I do n’t need a vibrator to get you off . I can do that myself . ”
105071	105095	105002	105002	his	1395	“ It ’s not about you not being able to get me off . It ’s about having fun , doing new things . ”
105096	105116	104943	104943	He	1395	“ Let ’s just stop talking about it , okay ? That ’s not a concern at the moment . ”
105117	105123	105124	105124	I	0	“ It is for me , ”
105131	105151	105124	105124	I	0	“ I do n’t want to marry someone who does n’t want to have sex with me , Brian . ”
105152	105156	105157	105157	he	1395	“ Excuse me ? ”
105160	105169	105157	105157	he	1395	“ You do n’t want to marry me ? ”
105170	105205	105124	105124	I	0	“ No , I do . I ’m just saying we ’re having some issues , and I think they need to be sorted before we get married . I think it ’s important . ”
105206	105259	105124	105124	I	0	“ The only issue I have is that you seem to be getting these ideas in your head about me , and I have no clue where they ’re coming from . We were fine before all of this , so why now ? Why are you second - guessing our relationship ? ”
105260	105328	105124	105124	I	0	“ I ’m not second - guessing , I ’m just trying to iron out some kinks , and I do n’t think I should be chastised for that . I mean , when I ’ve asked you for your support with your mom about the wedding stuff , you take her side . Do n’t you think you should be taking your future wife ’s side ? ”
105329	105346	105124	105124	I	0	“ Why does there have to be a side ? Why is n’t there a compromise ? ”
105347	105358	105124	105124	I	0	“ Because your mom does n’t understand the word compromise . ”
105359	105408	105124	105124	I	0	“ Pretty sure she ’s cut down the guest list , we ’re now getting married in a garden rather than a church , and there are daisies in the wedding to represent your mom . None of those were on my mother ’s list to begin with . ”
105409	105427	105124	105124	I	0	“ Your mother should n’t even have a list . Your mother should n’t be this involved . ”
105428	105455	105124	105124	I	0	“ She ’s representing me , Lia . Since I ’m busy , she ’s taking on the responsibility of standing up for what I want . ”
105456	105460	105461	105461	I	0	“ Oh really ? ”
105464	105478	105461	105461	I	0	“ So you believe it ’s imperative to have roses at your wedding ? ”
105479	105488	105124	105124	I	0	“ Yes , I think they ’re eloquent . ”
105489	105514	105124	105124	I	0	“ Please , Brian . You could n’t care less what ’s happening at the wedding . You ’re just going to show up . ”
105515	105546	105124	105124	I	0	“ That ’s not true . I want what ’s going to look nice , what ’s going to represent the family , and a day we can remember forever . ”
105547	105555	105556	105556	I	0	“ It ’s not always about image , ”
105564	105591	105559	105559	I	0	“ Why do you keep arguing about this ? You ’re getting your way with things . Why are you making a big deal about it ? ”
105592	105632	105124	105124	I	0	“ Because if this was what I wanted , we would n’t be having it at the club , we would n’t be inviting people I do n’t know , and I would n’t be changing into three dresses . ”
105633	105678	105124	105124	I	0	“ But it ’s not all about you , Lia . You might be the bride , but I ’m the groom , and there has to be pieces of me in the wedding planning as well . My mother knows what that is . ”
105679	105701	105702	105702	He	1398	“ Well , maybe if you talked to me about what you wanted , I could help pick those things out . ”
105709	105790	105702	105702	He	1398	“ You ’re creating a fight over nothing . Like I said , something has gotten in your head , and you ’re trying to find any excuse not to . . . not to go through with this . And if that ’s the case , Lia , just tell me now . I do n’t want to get to our wedding day and have you run out on me because you finally found the courage to do so . ”
105791	105804	105805	105805	I	0	“ Brian , I ’m not trying to get out of this , ”
105811	105900	105805	105805	I	0	“ I ’m just trying to get you to understand where I ’m coming from . I want us to be okay . I want you to be on my side . To want me . To not think I ’m going through some sort of crisis because I changed my hair . I mean . . . are you going to judge me when I walk down the aisle ? Are you going to think my dress is ugly ? Is that something I should worry about ? ”
105901	105917	105918	105918	I	0	“ No , my mother sent me a picture . It ’s a pretty dress . ”
105928	105942	105918	105918	I	0	“ Your mother . . . sent you a picture of my dress ? ”
105943	105954	105805	105805	I	0	“ Yes , she wanted to make sure I approved . ”
105955	105976	105984	105984	he	1399	“ That ’s not . . . that ’s not something you need to approve . That ’s my decision . ”
105977	105983	105984	105984	he	1399	“ Do you hear yourself ? ”
105987	106004	105984	105984	he	1399	“ You ’re being so selfish . This wedding is n’t just about you , Lia . ”
106005	106013	106014	106014	I	0	“ I did n’t say it was , ”
106017	106040	106014	106014	I	0	“ God , you ’re so infuriating . I ’m so glad you freaking came here to fix things . Good job . ”
106053	106064	106065	106065	I	0	“ Does any of this have to do with Breaker ? ”
106092	106100	106101	106101	I	0	“ I swear to God , Brian , ”
106110	106149	106101	106101	I	0	“ Bring him up one more time , and I will end this engagement , this wedding , and this relationship . This has nothing to do with him and everything to do with us and our disconnect . ”
106150	106158	106101	106101	I	0	“ I do n’t feel a disconnect . ”
106159	106166	106167	106167	I	0	“ Because you ’re not here , ”
106170	106213	106167	106167	I	0	“ You ’re so blind , so clueless . I mean , hell , I ’m offering to put your dick in my mouth , and you ca n’t even fathom the idea . You should want your dick in my mouth . ”
106214	106222	106223	106223	he	1401	“ You want to suck me off ? ”
106236	106245	106226	106226	He	1401	“ Fine , Lia . Suck me off . ”
106246	106253	106254	106254	I	0	“ You ’re such an asshole , ”
106268	106276	106277	106277	I	0	“ I do n’t feel very good , ”
106289	106327	106328	106328	JP	92	“ Because you had three shots of Scotch in ten minutes , realized your mistake , tried to counteract with buttery croissants and water , and now your stomach has no idea what to do with itself , ”

106377	106386	106368	106368	I	0	“ I bet she ’s a sweet moaner . ”
106387	106398	106373	106373	Huxley	92	“ Can you not speak so closely to my face ? ”
106399	106421	106373	106373	Huxley	92	“ I bet she has the best - tasting pussy ever , like . . . a fresh field of flowers . ”
106422	106432	106433	106433	JP	92	“ When was the last time you ate pussy ? ”
106449	106463	106441	106441	Huxley	92	“ I ca n’t remember , but I bet you hers is fantastic . ”
106464	106472	106473	106473	Huxley	92	“ Just dump him on his couch , ”
106476	106505	106473	106473	Huxley	92	“ No , my bedroom . I want to smell the pillow she used the other night . It smells like her . I want to clutch it . ”
106506	106523	106524	106524	JP	92	“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen a more embarrassing display of a man , ”
106527	106544	106524	106524	JP	92	“ If only Kelsey did n’t take my phone away so I could n’t record anything . ”
106545	106556	106557	106557	I	0	“ Kelsey is an angel sent from the heavens above , ”
106563	106633	106557	106557	I	0	“ And Lottie , well , she ’s funny , and I like that she busts your balls all the time , Huxley . I ’ve never seen a woman put you in your place like her . God , the way you grovel around her , talk about embarrassing . But that ’s what I ’d do with Lia , I would worship the ground she walks on . ”
106634	106639	106640	106640	Huxley	92	“ That ’s great , ”
106667	106676	106677	106677	Huxley	92	“ Shoes . Please take off my shoes . ”
106688	106696	106677	106677	Huxley	92	“ Go ahead , remove the shoes . ”
106697	106706	106677	106677	Huxley	92	“ Why do n’t you remove the shoes ? ”
106707	106724	106677	106677	Huxley	92	“ Because I ’m the older brother , which automatically puts me in the managerial role . ”
106725	106739	106677	106677	Huxley	92	“ Are you saying you ’ll manage how I take off his shoes ? ”
106740	106748	106677	106677	Huxley	92	“ Yeah , now take them off . ”
106749	106758	106759	106759	I	0	“ How about you both take one off ? ”
106766	106800	106759	106759	I	0	“ I could also use some more water . And maybe a bucket . I do n’t want to puke on the floor , and I have a good feeling that might happen . ”
106808	106816	106801	106801	JP	92	“ Shoes or puke pail and water ? ”

106842	106889	106839	106839	I	0	“ I hate you right now , you know that ? You interrupted my entire Sunday . Kelsey was supposed to spend the day naked in the house , and now I ’ve had to drag your sorry carcass around and take off your goddamn shoes . ”
106890	106894	106895	106895	He	92	“ And socks . ”
106920	106938	106908	106908	Huxley	92	“ Wow , you two are true heroes . The best brothers a guy could ask for . ”

109673	109679	109680	109680	I	0	“ Get a good sleep ? ”
109690	109694	109695	109695	she	1437	“ Not really , ”
109698	109727	109695	109695	she	1437	“ No ? Were you thinking too much about what flavor The Beave will force you to get ? My guess , something boring like vanilla on vanilla . ”
109786	109797	109798	109798	We	1445	“ So what do you think the flavor will be ? ”
109807	109823	109804	109804	she	1437	“ Uh , well . . . you ’re probably right . Vanilla on vanilla . ”
109824	109839	109840	109840	I	0	“ But we ’re going to fuck up that idea , are n’t we ? ”
109845	109853	109840	109840	I	0	“ Yeah , I guess we are . ”
109854	109860	109861	109861	We	1445	“ That ’s the spirit . ”
109872	109891	109892	109892	I	0	“ Now , there ’s one thing we need to talk about before we arrive at the bakery . ”
109903	109928	109892	109892	I	0	“ Where do we stand on red velvet ? We ’re both huge fans , but is it crazy enough to drive her nuts ? ”
109938	109956	109957	109957	She	1437	“ I do n’t think so . We might have to ask for the cotton candy flavor . ”
109996	110002	110003	110003	I	0	“ That ’s my girl , ”
110006	110016	110003	110003	I	0	“ Cotton candy , all day , every day . ”

110060	110087	110048	110048	her	111	“ Oh yeah , I ’ll be here for everything . Plus , it ’s cake . Ca n’t miss a chance for some free samples . ”
110144	110148	110149	110150	The Beave	111	“ Very well . ”
110161	110167	110149	110150	The Beave	111	“ Shall we head in ? ”
110168	110172	110173	110173	I	0	“ We shall , ”
110210	110227	110197	110197	I	0	“ Do n’t laugh at me , or The Beave will know we ’re in cahoots . ”
110228	110238	110239	110239	she	168	“ Pretty sure it ’s too late for that , ”
110248	110261	110239	110239	she	168	“ Mrs. Beaver , thank you so much for joining us today . ”
110262	110266	110267	110267	She	168	“ Of course . ”
110274	110291	110267	110267	She	168	“ This is Ophelia , the bride , and this is her friend , Breaker Cane . ”
110292	110303	110267	110267	She	168	“ Hello , it ’s very nice to meet you . ”
110346	110355	110356	110357	The Beave	111	“ Ah , there you are , sweetheart , ”
110360	110363	110364	110364	Lia	168	“ Brian , ”
110369	110380	110364	110364	Lia	168	“ What , uh , what are you doing here ? ”
110381	110399	110400	110400	He	1453	“ I was able to move a few meetings around . Could n’t miss the cake testing . ”
110439	110455	110425	110425	he	1453	“ Hey , man . I got it from here . You can take off . ”
110482	110498	110479	110479	she	168	“ No , Breaker can stay . I ’d love to have his opinion still . ”
110504	110515	110516	110516	Brian	100	“ Okay , sure . The more , the merrier , ”
110594	110637	110587	110587	he	1453	“ Well , then , why do n’t you four take a seat , and I ’ll get the samples ready for presentation ? I ’ll be out shortly . In the meantime , can I have my assistant grab anyone champagne ? ”
110638	110641	110642	110643	The Beave	111	“ Please , ”
110646	110651	110642	110643	The Beave	111	“ One for everyone . ”
110736	110750	110721	110721	Lia	168	“ Now , I ’ve informed the baker of our preference of flavors , ”
110757	110763	110764	110764	I	0	“ What would those be ? ”
110767	110777	110764	110764	I	0	“ Because I do n’t think you asked Lia . ”
110778	110786	110787	110787	Brian	100	“ I told her what Lia likes , ”
110790	110799	110800	110800	I	0	“ Oh , and what did you say ? ”
110808	110815	110803	110803	Brian	100	“ Vanilla bean with vanilla frosting . ”
110823	110831	110832	110832	I	0	“ That ’s not what she prefers , ”
110853	110933	110934	110934	Brian	100	“ If she has to suffer through something as drab as vanilla , then she prefers to pair it with a raspberry lemon curd . She also enjoys red velvet with cream cheese frosting , but the cake must have chocolate chips in it . If there are no chocolate chips , she wants nothing to do with red velvet . But her favorite flavor is lemon blueberry , which I ’m sure is not an option you considered . ”
110945	110955	110956	110956	Lia	168	“ You have been just fine with vanilla before . ”
110964	110974	110956	110956	Lia	168	“ Well , it ’s not my first pick . ”
110975	110982	110983	110984	The Beave	111	“ But a pick at that , ”
110988	111013	110983	110984	The Beave	111	“ And since we will have over three thousand attendees , going with the most common flavor will obviously be the most beneficial choice . ”
111014	111018	111019	111019	Lia	168	“ Three thousand ? ”
111030	111039	111028	111028	Brian	100	“ I thought we cut that list down . ”
111040	111046	111047	111047	Brian	100	“ We were going to , ”
111050	111070	111047	111047	Brian	100	“ but I spoke with Mother last night , and we think it ’s best not to insult anyone . ”
111076	111081	111082	111082	I	0	“ Not insult anyone ? ”
111086	111102	111082	111082	I	0	“ How do you even know three thousand people ? That seems absurd to me . ”
111103	111114	111115	111115	Brian	100	“ Well , good thing it ’s not your wedding , ”
111119	111159	111115	111115	Brian	100	“ Maybe when you ’re finally able to get someone to fall in love with you and walk down the aisle instead of creeping on other men ’s girls , you can choose how many people attend the wedding . ”
111160	111163	111164	111164	Lia	168	“ Hey , ”
111167	111177	111164	111164	Lia	168	“ Brian , he ’s not creeping on anyone . ”
111178	111183	111184	111185	The Beave	111	“ Now , now , ”
111244	111275	111239	111240	The Beave	111	“ Brian and I had a long conversation about the wedding planning that I frankly thought was getting out of hand , and we agreed on some things last night . ”
111276	111288	111289	111289	I	0	“ How the hell could you have a conversation without Lia ? ”
111299	111303	111304	111305	The Beave	111	“ Pardon me ? ”
111308	111324	111304	111305	The Beave	111	“ Mr. Cane , it would do you a service not to swear at me . ”
111335	111400	111405	111405	my	0	“ Mrs. Beaver , it would do you a service to treat Lia with some respect . In case you ’ve forgotten , my brothers and I own this city , this state , this country , so unless you want your reputation to completely and utterly tank , you will tell Lia exactly why the plans you ’ve already made are not satisfactory . ”
111467	111479	111480	111480	Brian	100	“ Where do you get off threatening my mother like that ? ”
111506	111516	111500	111501	The Beave	111	“ Relax , darling , I can handle this . ”
111530	111546	111524	111524	her	111	“ As you are aware , this union was not my first choice for Brian — ”
111547	111553	111554	111554	Lia	168	“ What do you mean ? ”
111563	111575	111557	111557	her	168	“ Mother , that ’s not true . You like Lia . ”
111576	111658	111557	111557	her	168	“ I do . I think you are a lovely girl , but if I had my way , Brian would marry someone with status , and unfortunately , that ’s not the case here . And therefore , I am paying for a wedding that reflects our status , even though he ’s marrying you . That is why we switched back to the church , took out the daisies , and invited the people we originally wanted to invite . ”
111793	111866	111786	111786	Lia	168	“ You allowed her to do that ? It ’s one thing to just sit there and allow her to insult me to my face about how I ’m not the pedigree of woman she would prefer for you to marry , but to have a conversation with her last night , after we fought , and let her change everything about our wedding ? Did you do that out of spite ? ”
111867	111875	111876	111877	the baker	1451	“ Okay , here are the samples , ”
111905	111943	111944	111944	She	1451	“ We have as requested , the vanilla bean cake with vanilla frosting , the vanilla bean cake with chocolate frosting . The chocolate fudge cake with vanilla frosting , and the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting . ”
111952	111955	111944	111944	She	1451	“ Enjoy , ”
111973	112012	111970	111970	Brian	100	“ I did n’t do anything out of spite . My mother was consoling me after our fight , and we discussed how the wedding was stressing you and that we should just let Mother do the planning . ”
112023	112065	112013	112013	Lia	168	“ The only reason the wedding planning is stressful is because we ’re being forced to get married in four weeks , your mother is trying to take over , and no one seems to be listening to me besides Breaker . ”
112066	112079	112080	112080	Brian	100	“ Because Breaker wants nothing more than for our relationship to fail , ”
112099	112129	112090	112090	We	1479	“ He ’s been nothing but supportive . He even gave me tips on how to give you a blow job . . . one you did n’t want . ”
112130	112135	112141	112141	her	111	“ Jesus , Mary , ”
112185	112194	112180	112180	I	0	“ Can we show an ounce of decorum ? ”
112195	112209	112210	112210	Brian	100	“ Why the hell are you talking to Breaker about our sex life ? ”
112213	112218	112219	112219	Lia	168	“ What sex life ? ”
112232	112244	112219	112219	Lia	168	“ You barely even look at me when I ’m naked . ”
112271	112278	112279	112280	The Beave	111	“ Ophelia , lower your voice , ”
112283	112309	112279	112280	The Beave	111	“ Why ? So people do n’t hear that your son would rather spend his nights working on his computer than fucking me in bed ? ”
112377	112382	112383	112383	Brian	100	“ Lia , enough , ”
112386	112399	112383	112383	Brian	100	“ That is a completely inappropriate way to talk to my mother . ”
112400	112432	112433	112433	I	0	“ But she can act like I ’m a second - class citizen , and you have no problem with that ? Do n’t you see the issue here , Brian ? ”
112460	112474	112456	112457	The Beave	111	“ Let ’s all take a deep breath and focus on the cake . ”
112484	112578	112579	112579	Brian	100	“ You will always take her side , no matter what . She can say to my face how I do n’t meet her standards , but because she ’s so desperate to see you married , she ’ll settle for me as a daughter - in - law . Do you understand how fucked up that is , Brian ? Why would I want to enter a family who treats me like that ? Why would I want to be with a man who allows his family to treat me like that ? ”
112592	112608	112579	112579	Brian	100	“ Mother is right . I think we all need to take a deep breath . ”
112609	112618	112619	112619	Lia	168	“ I do n’t need a deep breath , ”
112622	112634	112635	112635	She	168	“ I have never in my life seen anything more clearly . ”
112695	112728	112680	112681	God Almighty	199	“ I ’m done , Brian . I should have been done a while ago , but maybe I just needed the cold - hearted evidence about why I should be done . ”
112729	112736	112737	112737	Brian	100	“ What are you talking about ? ”
112789	112948	112771	112771	he	1484	“ You treat me like I come third in your life , directly under work and your mother , and I do n’t want to be with someone who does n’t consider me their number one . You insult me when you say things like I ’m having a mental crisis , that I never should have changed my hair , and that you hate my glasses . You hurt me when you do n’t want to touch me at night , when you do n’t want to even try something new . I think the only reason I ’ve been hanging on for so long is because when I met you , you helped me through the grief of losing my parents . But now , I just wonder if that was out of the kindness of your heart , or if that was you trying to use the loss of them to get closer to me . ”
112949	112957	112958	112958	She	1486	“ Lia , that is not true . ”
112965	113054	112958	112958	She	1486	“ I ’m done . I ’m done with everything . I ’m done feeling like shit when you ’re around . I ’m done worrying if you ’ll actually kiss me or not when you see me . I ’m done asking myself if I ’m good enough for you , good enough for your family . And I ’m done dealing with your psychopath mother . I need more . I want more . And I sure as hell deserve more . Come on , Breaker . ”
113085	113090	113076	113076	I	0	“ Always a pleasure . ”
113108	113138	113101	113101	she	1488	“ Also , the club is probably one of the ugliest places I ’ve ever seen , and nothing about it is elitist other than trying to look elite . ”
113161	113179	113182	113182	she	1488	“ I ’m taking this with me because it ’s the only decent flavor on the platter . ”
113205	113209	113210	113210	I	0	“ Holy shit , ”
113218	113230	113231	113231	She	1488	“ Lia , I ca n’t fucking believe you did that . ”
113245	113265	113237	113237	she	1488	“ Oh my God , oh my God . . . did I just say all of those things ? ”
113288	113304	113266	113266	I	0	“ You fucking did and , Jesus Christ , I ’m so proud of you . ”
113305	113309	113310	113310	Her	1488	“ You are ? ”
113327	113354	113310	113310	Her	1488	“ Yes , Lia . That was so fucking amazing and well - deserved . Jesus , my nipples got hard in there listening to you . ”
113360	113366	113367	113367	I	0	“ Hard nipples , really ? ”
113394	113399	113385	113385	she	1488	“ It is hard . ”
113400	113417	113418	113418	She	1488	“ See . Hell , I ’m so proud of you . How do you feel ? ”
113426	113436	113418	113418	She	1488	“ I feel . . . I feel good . ”
113443	113446	113437	113437	Her	1488	“ Free . ”
113476	113482	113483	113483	I	0	“ We need to celebrate . ”
113496	113501	113489	113489	she	1488	“ I have cake . ”
113502	113519	113520	113520	She	1488	“ I think we need more than just cake , but yes , let ’s eat . ”
113574	113585	113571	113571	she	1488	“ I think I know what I want to do . ”
113586	113592	113571	113571	she	1488	“ Let ’s hear it . ”
113593	113617	113571	113571	she	1488	“ Grab some pizza for lunch , lots and lots of hard cider , go back to your place , and play Plunder . ”
113618	113627	113571	113571	she	1488	“ That ’s how you want to celebrate ? ”
113628	113639	113640	113640	she	1488	“ I could n’t have asked for a better idea , ”
113652	113663	113640	113640	she	1488	“ Then let ’s eat some pizza and play Plunder . ”
113695	113718	113692	113692	I	0	“ Just want to make sure , are you happy ? You just called off a wedding and broke up with Brian . ”
113727	113741	113724	113724	she	1488	“ I am . It was the right move , thanks for checking . ”
113742	113755	113724	113724	she	1488	“ As long as you ’re good , then let ’s celebrate . ”
113756	113763	113724	113724	she	1488	“ I ’m good . Promise . ”
114460	114476	114477	114477	she	168	“ I ’m going to start with a slice of each . What about you ? ”
114489	114505	114477	114477	she	168	“ Yeah , I think I ’ll do the same . I ’ll grab drinks . ”
114506	114515	114516	114516	We	1516	“ I ’ll meet you on the couch . ”
114575	114618	114619	114619	I	0	“ Oh my God , can we just talk about that cake for a second and how dry it was ? The Beave actually thought that was the best in town . No offense to the baker . . . but woof . ”
114626	114667	114619	114619	I	0	“ Are you going to require a dessert to make up for that ? Because I can get something delivered . Anything for your heroism today . Taking down The Beave requires all the good things to come your way . ”
114668	114671	114672	114672	I	0	“ Hmm . ”
114692	114719	114685	114685	I	0	“ You know , I ’ve always believed donuts can be eaten at any time . Let ’s get a dozen glazed jelly from Arnold ’s . ”
114720	114731	114732	114732	I	0	“ Let me grab my phone . I ’ll order . ”
114850	114853	114854	114854	I	0	“ Ha ! ”
114859	114866	114854	114854	I	0	“ Okay , sure , Brian . ”
114888	114900	114901	114901	Lia	168	“ Arrrrrrrrr , ye land lubber , hand over ye resources , ”
114913	114941	114901	114901	Lia	168	“ But if you take the last of my rum , I wo n’t have anything . Do you really want to end the game like that ? ”
114948	114955	114942	114942	I	0	“ Taking a man ’s rum ? ”
114956	114963	114964	114964	She	168	“ I said hand it over . ”
114987	115002	114979	114979	I	0	“ Fine . Take my rum , but I hope you burn in hell . ”
115027	115034	115035	115035	she	168	“ Victory is mine once again , ”

115078	115097	115065	115065	I	0	“ Maybe some water . If we keep this up , we will be passing out at eight . ”
115098	115117	115065	115065	I	0	“ Is that a problem ? Copious amounts of sleep are good for the body , you know ? ”
115118	115135	115065	115065	I	0	“ Very true . Fine , grab me another . I ’ll clean up the board . ”
115136	115152	115065	115065	I	0	“ Clearing the evidence of my victory already ? You ’re such a poor sport . ”
115153	115202	115065	115065	I	0	“ Lia , I just lost three times . It is five at night , and I have nothing to show for myself today other than cheering you on as you told The Beave off , demolishing cake from your hand , and eating six slices of pizza . ”
115203	115213	115065	115065	I	0	“ Seems like you accomplished a lot to me . ”
115214	115221	115222	115222	She	1526	“ Not as much as you . ”
115230	115254	115222	115222	She	1526	“ Well , no one can accomplish as much as I did . I palmed a cake and stormed out of a bakery . ”
115258	115274	115255	115255	I	0	“ I do n’t think I ’ll ever get that image out of my head . ”
115306	115327	115296	115296	We	1527	“ You know , I was thinking about your list of things you wanted to accomplish before you got married . ”
115328	115333	115334	115334	she	1526	“ What about it ? ”
115337	115386	115334	115334	she	1526	“ I think you should keep doing it . Clearly , it ’s given you this beautiful confidence to take charge of your life , and it would be a shame if you stopped . Plus , you checked off another one of the things on your list . ”
115387	115396	115296	115296	We	1527	“ You remember what ’s on my list ? ”
115397	115406	115407	115407	I	0	“ Lia , I remember everything about you , ”
115417	115458	115407	115407	I	0	“ Do something that makes you feel pretty . Well , you did that with your hair and shopping . Not that you needed it , but I can see that you love it , and I love it too . ”
115463	115508	115407	115407	I	0	“ The second was create a circle of trust . Well , you have me , and I think you bonded with Kelsey , Lottie , and Myla the other day as well as starting a knitting club . That ’s a great start . ”
115509	115522	115459	115459	Her	1526	“ It is . I really like them . They ’re fun . ”
115523	115556	115459	115459	Her	1526	“ The third one was to spend a day saying yes . You just name the time and place , and I ’ll be right there by your side the whole time . ”
115557	115580	115581	115581	She	1526	“ Let me catch up on the work I ’ve put off , and then we ’ll make a day of it . ”
115596	115641	115581	115581	She	1526	“ The fourth was to stand up for yourself . Well , you can check that one off because damn , Lia , you took the world by storm today , and it was so fucking amazing to watch . I was in awe . ”
115642	115650	115651	115651	She	1526	“ Thank you . It felt good . ”
115660	115801	115651	115651	She	1526	“ I ca n’t believe he ’d just sit there and let her say those things about me . It just shows that maybe he was n’t really in love with me , and I do n’t think I was in love with him . At least not recently . It ’s hard to be in love with someone when they do n’t treat you like they love you . They can say the words , like he did , but he did n’t prove it . He did n’t act on his love . It ’s about the little things , you know ? The things you do n’t even notice until they ’re done . Like . . . like stocking my favorite coffee because you know I ca n’t drink anything else . Brian never did that . ”
115802	115819	115820	115820	I	0	“ I ’m not that douche . And I would n’t want you drinking anything else . ”
115827	115903	115823	115823	She	1528	“ I think my choice today also coincides with my fifth task : following my heart . It ’s scary to break off an engagement because you do n’t want to disappoint people , or hurt feelings , but I just felt it , you know ? After speaking with the girls , things felt off , not right . And then when Brian did n’t even defend me , I knew it was over . ”
115904	115913	115914	115914	She	1528	“ I ’m glad you listened to yourself . ”
115924	115930	115916	115916	her	1528	“ Did you hate him ? ”
115945	115961	115931	115931	I	0	“ Brian ? Yes . I did . With the fury of a thousand men . ”
115962	115971	115972	115972	she	1528	“ Wait , you hated him that much ? ”
115975	116022	115972	115972	she	1528	“ Uh . . . yeah , Lia . The only reason I tried to get along with him was for you . Not because I thought we could be friends or that I thought he was a good guy . It was all for you . ”
116086	116093	116094	116094	I	0	“ You should have told me . ”
116099	116121	116096	116096	my	0	“ I did n’t want to influence you . My feelings on the matter should never have been taken into consideration . ”
116122	116148	116157	116157	her	1528	“ But , Breaker , if I had married Brian , would n’t that have been like one of your brothers marrying someone you hated ? ”
116160	116165	116154	116154	I	0	“ Yes and no . ”
116202	116236	116193	116193	I	0	“ Lia , if I have learned anything through your brief and torrid engagement with Brian , it ’s this . I love you too much to be happy to love you less . ”
116237	116243	116244	116244	She	1528	“ What does that mean ? ”
116251	116318	116244	116244	She	1528	“ It means that the only way I ’ll be happy if you marry someone else is if you are one hundred percent committed to him and him alone . If you were marrying me , no fucking way could I share you with another man , best friend or not . And I would n’t expect your husband to love you any less than that . ”
116483	116489	116490	116490	I	0	“ Do you want another ? ”
116500	116503	116504	116504	he	1531	“ Sure , ”

116769	116782	116766	116766	I	0	“ Or watch a movie . We can watch The Thin Man . ”
116783	116799	116746	116746	I	0	“ Are you sure you do n’t want to annihilate me in another board game ? ”
116800	116809	116817	116817	He	1531	“ I ’m trying to save your pride . ”
116810	116816	116817	116817	He	1531	“ Are n’t you considerate . ”
116851	116867	116868	116868	He	1531	“ Oh , I recorded some reruns of Password in case you wanted to play . ”

116923	116938	116913	116913	I	0	“ Stop . . . how am I supposed to guess spoon from dairy ? ”
116954	116964	116965	116965	he	1531	“ Because you slurp dairy up with a spoon , ”
117001	117014	117024	117024	he	1531	“ You could have said spork . You ’ve lost your touch . ”

117031	117047	117021	117021	he	1531	“ And I just ate a donut , so my mind is n’t working well . ”

117136	117143	117144	117144	he	1531	“ We drank ten cans each , ”
117147	117156	117144	117144	he	1531	“ Over like . . . ten hours . ”
117157	117189	117109	117109	he	1531	“ Lia Fairweather - Fern , it has not been ten hours . And we ’ve gulped down three in the past hour , so . . . we are drunk . ”
117190	117202	117144	117144	he	1531	“ You might be drunk , but I ’m not drunk . ”
117203	117207	117208	117208	he	1531	“ Oh yeah ? ”
117211	117220	117208	117208	he	1531	“ Stand and walk in a straight line . ”

117330	117342	117321	117321	I	0	“ It ’s not ? Then who ’s operating your legs ? ”
117343	117357	117358	117358	I	0	“ Me , but . . . it ’s my bra ’s fault , ”
117361	117382	117358	117358	I	0	“ It ’s constricting the blood from reaching my toes , and that ’s what makes it hard to walk . ”
117383	117393	117321	117321	I	0	“ Wow , that ’s quite the scientific reasoning . ”
117394	117404	117405	117405	I	0	“ Well , you try walking with a bra , ”
117442	117446	117433	117433	I	0	“ You try . ”
117493	117500	117501	117501	He	68	“ That was hot , Lia . ”
117511	117515	117501	117501	He	68	“ Really hot . ”

117716	117721	117722	117722	He	68	“ I know so . ”

117785	117794	117768	117768	he	68	“ Fuck , why is this so tight ? ”
117795	117807	117808	117808	He	68	“ Uh , maybe because you are much larger than me . ”
117846	117869	117834	117834	he	68	“ Can you fucking help me instead of just watching me run in circles like a dog trying to catch his tail ? ”
117870	117878	117879	117879	He	68	“ I ’m actually good just watching . ”
117941	117958	117929	117929	He	68	“ You know , I do n’t really think this is a good look for me . ”

117980	118005	117929	117929	He	68	“ Then let ’s just get this over before I lose all sense of myself and start matching your lipstick with my nipple color . ”
118006	118009	118010	118010	I	0	“ What ? ”
118013	118024	118010	118010	I	0	“ Why would you match it with your nipple color ? ”
118025	118052	117929	117929	He	68	“ I saw this girl talk about it on Tik Tok . How the perfect shade of lip would match your nipple . That not true ? ”
118053	118064	117929	117929	He	68	“ Why are you watching makeup tutorials on Tik Tok ? ”
118065	118140	118141	118141	He	1548	“ I do n’t search them out . They just pop up . The girl had a Boston accent . I think her name was Mikayla . Really fucking entertaining that I watched a few of her Tik Toks . No shame . She ’s actually really inspirational . Lives her life the way she wants . And hey , now you know to match your lipstick to your nipples . You ’re welcome . ”
118160	118170	118171	118171	I	0	“ You know this does n’t count , right ? ”

118184	118194	118195	118195	I	0	“ Uh , because it ’s not big enough . ”

118234	118237	118238	118238	he	1548	“ Ridiculous , ”
118270	118283	118265	118265	I	0	“ Oh my God , you could have taken my eye out . ”
118284	118288	118241	118241	he	1548	“ Dramatic much ? ”

118308	118318	118299	118299	I	0	“ Death by bra , that ’s a first . ”
118319	118374	118241	118241	he	1548	“ Uh , excuse me , sir . I have no doubt in my mind that many a woman have met their creator because of a poorly manufactured brassiere , most likely designed by a man who has zero concept of the kind of damage a destructive underwire can have on an unsuspecting soul . ”
118375	118387	118388	118388	His	1549	“ You do realize a bra is a choice , right ? ”
118404	118442	118443	118443	He	1549	“ Oh sure , right , a bra is a choice , so if I started walking around with my tits out , you think I wo n’t have complaints about erect nipples or showing too much ? ”
118457	118462	118445	118445	his	1549	“ No complaints here . ”
118463	118468	118445	118445	his	1549	“ Ugh , pervert . ”
118483	118496	118469	118469	I	0	“ You ca n’t be serious . This might make me puke . ”
118497	118506	118507	118507	I	0	“ Or sleepy . I prefer the sleepy . ”
118549	118582	118546	118546	I	0	“ You know , there ’s no one else I would want to spend my time with after I called off a wedding and broke up with my fiancé other than you . ”

118603	118638	118583	118583	I	0	“ When you first saw me in the hallway of your dorm , did you ever think this is where we would end up ? Neighbors , best friends , attached at the hip ? ”
118639	118660	118583	118583	I	0	“ Uh . . . not at that moment , but after that night , I had a good inkling . ”
118661	118665	118583	118583	I	0	“ How so ? ”
118666	118696	118583	118583	I	0	“ We just matched . Like when everyone left Scrabble that night , and we were alone , I felt like my missing puzzle piece was put into place . ”
118697	118704	118705	118705	We	1551	“ I felt the same way . ”
118718	118728	118705	118705	We	1551	“ I would be lost without you , Breaker . ”

118756	118800	118748	118748	I	0	“ You have so much going for you . Your business , you have a strong family bond and sisters - in - law who are so much fun . You have promise , a community surrounding you , and so much opportunity . ”
118801	118811	118812	118812	he	1552	“ And you do n’t have any of that ? ”
118828	118864	118815	118815	his	1552	“ I have you . I ’m building a circle . And I have a job that I love , but I do n’t know , I just feel like you have so much more . ”
118865	118913	118815	118815	his	1552	“ What I have , you have . You know Huxley and JP treat you like a sister . And you ’ve built your business from the ground up , not many people can say that . Are these feelings stemming from not having your parents around ? ”
118914	118919	118920	118920	I	0	“ I think so , ”
118923	118936	118920	118920	I	0	“ God , do you think I will ever get over it ? ”
118937	118981	118815	118815	his	1552	“ No , I do n’t think losing your parents is something you get over , I think it ’s just a tender hurt you learn to live with . It will take time , but it will get easier with each day . ”
118982	118990	118991	118991	I	0	“ I can still feel them sometimes , ”
119003	119028	118991	118991	I	0	“ At night , when I feel alone in my apartment , I can sometimes feel that they ’re there , watching over me . ”

119037	119069	119034	119034	Breaker	68	“ They ’re always watching over you . And you know , when you ’re feeling alone , you can always come over . That ’s what I ’m here for . ”
119070	119074	119075	119075	He	68	“ You are . ”

119182	119188	119189	119189	he	68	“ Why are you smiling ? ”
119215	119242	119202	119202	I	0	“ You ’re a far cry from the guy I met back in college . Remember that caterpillar you grew on your upper lip ? Atrocious . ”
119243	119255	119294	119294	I	0	“ Hey , there were a few girls who liked it . ”
119256	119283	119202	119202	I	0	“ Amanda Fulton ? Yeah , because she liked every guy with two nipples and a penis , she pretty much looked past the nose fur . ”
119284	119293	119294	119294	I	0	“ Were nipples really a requirement for her ? ”

119321	119328	119329	119329	he	68	“ Because we drank too much , ”

119343	119349	119350	119350	He	68	“ Then go to bed . ”

119731	119740	119741	119741	He	68	“ Yes , but this is my bed . ”
119751	119773	119774	119774	He	68	“ Fine . If you ’re going to be like that , then I have no choice than to do this . ”
119795	119812	119776	119776	his	68	“ Are you saying this is a punishment ? Because it does n’t feel like one . ”
119821	119843	119844	119844	he	68	“ It will be when I roll away in the middle of the night , and you fall off the bed , ”
119847	119855	119856	119856	He	68	“ And they say chivalry is dead . ”
119859	119894	119856	119856	He	68	“ If you were my girlfriend , then yeah , I ’d let you do whatever you want . But that ’s not the case here . You ’re just the trolling best friend . ”

119904	119928	119901	119901	I	0	“ Care to explain to me how this hold is different ? Because it seems like you ’re spooning me like a girlfriend . ”
119929	119932	119933	119933	He	68	“ Nah . ”
119937	119958	119933	119933	He	68	“ This is friendly . If you were my girlfriend , my hand would be in an entirely different place . ”
119959	119974	119901	119901	I	0	“ Ugh , men , always wanting their hand between a woman ’s legs . ”
119975	119984	119901	119901	I	0	“ That ’s not where I was thinking . ”

120067	120102	120057	120057	his	68	“ Well , call me confused because I ca n’t think of any other place to stick your hand . I mean , down my mouth , but that feels like a choking hazard . ”

120138	120157	120158	120158	He	68	“ You see , it ’s not about the obvious touch . It ’s about the subtle one . ”
120183	120215	120178	120178	his	68	“ This is how I would touch her . Just light enough to let her know I ’m here , but not too much to make her think I want more . ”
120216	120219	120220	120220	I	0	“ Oh , ”

133949	133983	133905	133905	Lottie	96	“ I love it . Breaker and I used to get it all the time in college . There was a place downtown that was n’t too pricey , but it was amazing . ”
133984	133989	133990	133990	Lottie	96	“ Speaking of Breaker , ”
133996	134010	133990	133990	Lottie	96	“ I heard through the grapevine that he ’s been making a move . ”
134017	134020	134021	134021	Kelsey	113	“ What ? ”
134024	134033	134021	134021	Kelsey	113	“ JP did n’t say anything to me . ”
134034	134039	134043	134043	she	96	“ That ’s shocking , ”
134058	134067	134043	134043	she	96	“ He ’s a bigger gossip than Hux . ”
134068	134077	134078	134078	Myla	188	“ I even heard a whispering of something , ”
134081	134111	134078	134078	Myla	188	“ But my husband and his brother ca n’t keep anything to themselves , and Breaker hangs out with Banner enough for there to be a leak between them . ”
134118	134125	134112	134112	Myla	188	“ So , is it true ? ”
134155	134163	134164	134165	The girls	551	“ Uh , yeah , he did . ”
134178	134189	134190	134190	Lottie	96	“ That boy has had it really bad for you , ”
134193	134211	134190	134190	Lottie	96	“ God , I ’m so glad he finally did something about it . How was it ? ”
134222	134231	134212	134212	I	0	“ He ’s had it bad for me ? ”
134247	134255	134237	134237	Lottie	96	“ I mean . . . what ? ”
134262	134277	134256	134256	She	96	“ You said he has it bad for me . What do you mean ? ”
134278	134299	134237	134237	Lottie	96	“ Uh , I do n’t think I said that , right , Kelsey ? I did n’t say that . ”
134300	134311	134256	134256	She	96	“ Yeah , I do n’t think she said that . ”
134312	134319	134320	134320	Myla	188	“ That ’s what I heard , ”
134338	134390	134334	134334	she	188	“ Listen , we ’re here for a reason . These men of ours often have the upper hand , and any advantage we can have over them , the better , so we might as well be truthful with her . Yes , Breaker has had it bad for you . ”
134391	134400	134401	134401	Lottie	96	“ He did n’t say that to you ? ”
134407	134430	134401	134401	Lottie	96	“ No , he did n’t . He would n’t say anything really , other than he knows what he ’s doing . ”
134431	134437	134438	134438	Kelsey	113	“ Of course he does , ”
134445	134464	134438	134438	Kelsey	113	“ All the Cane brothers know what they ’re doing and we are mere pawns in their plans . ”
134465	134469	134470	134470	Lottie	96	“ Oh stop , ”
134473	134501	134470	134470	Lottie	96	“ I do n’t see any of us complaining about the orgasms . Which by the way , you did n’t answer me . Was it good ? ”
134510	134528	134502	134502	I	0	“ Yeah , it was spectacular . Like . . . unlike anything I ’ve ever experienced . ”
134529	134534	134535	134535	Kelsey	113	“ It always is , ”
134544	134574	134535	134535	Kelsey	113	“ I swear these men have some sort of secret society where they learn how to precisely play with a woman so they ’re ruined for any other man . ”
134575	134580	134581	134581	Myla	188	“ It ’s true , ”
134584	134599	134581	134581	Myla	188	“ Ryot has always been able to control my body , rendering it useless . ”
134600	134629	134535	134535	Kelsey	113	“ Huxley is the same . I hated him so much when we first met , but somehow , he kept me around by using just his fingers . ”
134630	134636	134637	134637	I	0	“ Breaker used his tongue , ”
134659	134675	134676	134676	I	0	“ But he started it by ‘ helping me dry off from the shower . ’ ”
134687	134715	134676	134676	I	0	“ And before I knew what was happening , he had me pressed against my apartment window , completely naked , and was going down on me . ”
134716	134724	134725	134725	Lottie	96	“ God , that ’s so hot , ”
134728	134744	134725	134725	Lottie	96	“ I love when Huxley fucks me against a window . It feels so naughty . ”
134745	134752	134753	134753	Kelsey	113	“ So it was magnificent then , ”
134763	134772	134760	134760	she	113	“ Then why do I sense some hesitation ? ”
134773	134777	134778	134778	I	0	“ Two reasons , ”
134781	134808	134760	134760	she	113	“ For one , I literally just broke up with my fiancé and called off my wedding . I think it makes me look incredibly slutty . ”
134809	134816	134817	134817	Myla	188	“ I do n’t think so , ”
134820	134838	134817	134817	Myla	188	“ I think it ’s just you figuring out what you want , and that ’s important . ”
134839	134843	134844	134844	Kelsey	113	“ I agree , ”
134847	134857	134844	134844	Kelsey	113	“ Me too . What ’s the second reason ? ”
134861	134959	134858	134858	Lottie	96	“ It ’s Breaker . He ’s everything to me , and even though when we ’re in the moment , when he ’s touching me , making me feel things I ’ve never felt before , I ca n’t help but worry . What happens if this does n’t work out ? What if something goes wrong ? What if he gets bored of me and moves on ? It ’s weird now when he ’s intimate , it ’s going to be so much weirder if I get attached and he decides to move on . ”
134960	134966	134969	134969	her	96	“ Not going to happen . ”
134972	134977	134969	134969	her	96	“ Breaker would never . ”
134978	134989	134990	134990	I	0	“ But he ’s never had a true relationship before , ”
134993	135000	135001	135001	Kelsey	113	“ Because he ’s had you , ”
135004	135035	135001	135001	Kelsey	113	“ Because you ’ve been everything he ’s ever needed , and now that he ’s figured that out , he ’s trying to take things to the next level . ”
135036	135054	135055	135055	Lottie	96	“ But . . . he has n’t kissed me . He ’s just given me orgasms . ”
135076	135080	135073	135073	her	96	“ Oh no . ”
135081	135087	135088	135088	I	0	“ Oh no , what ? ”
135094	135103	135091	135091	Kelsey	113	“ We know exactly what he ’s doing . ”
135104	135107	135108	135108	I	0	“ What ? ”
135114	135130	135131	135131	Lottie	96	“ He has a plan , a meticulous plan to make you fall for him , ”
135134	135139	135140	135140	Kelsey	113	“ It ’s true . ”
135143	135187	135188	135188	Lottie	96	“ The Cane brothers , well , they ’re something else . When they have their mind set on something , they make it happen their way . Meaning , he has n’t kissed you because he ’s waiting for the perfect moment . ”
135191	135208	135188	135188	Lottie	96	“ Yup . The first kiss means something to him , so he ’s saving it . ”
135209	135218	135219	135219	I	0	“ And going down on me means nothing ? ”
135234	135246	135230	135230	Myla	188	“ Have you guys ever been intimate before in your friendship ? ”
135247	135250	135251	135251	I	0	“ Never , ”
135257	135271	135254	135254	She	188	“ Then this is him probably showing you that it can be normal . ”
135272	135277	135278	135278	Kelsey	113	“ Ah , yes , ”
135281	135349	135278	135278	Kelsey	113	“ God , that would so be something one of them would do . Think about the amount of times JP teased me before we actually had sex . Or you and Huxley . It ’s their MO . It ’s what they do . They turn you into putty until you ca n’t do anything other than follow them around , waiting for their next move . ”
135350	135353	135354	135354	Lottie	96	“ Facts , ”
135357	135384	135354	135354	Lottie	96	“ The first time Huxley touched me was my last first — that ’s how powerful it was . Did it feel like that to you ? ”
135421	135499	135500	135500	Kelsey	113	“ It felt . . . it felt like nothing I ’ve ever felt before . It was as if I was just a mere instrument to him , and he knew exactly how to play me . I mean , I let him hold me by the throat . I let him put me into positions I never would have in the past , and I was convinced only by his touch , by his voice . ”
135505	135516	135517	135517	Lottie	96	“ Yup , he ’s playing his cards with you , ”
135520	135527	135517	135517	Lottie	96	“ So what do I do ? ”
135531	135534	135535	135535	Kelsey	113	“ Nothing , ”
135538	135564	135535	135535	Kelsey	113	“ There ’s absolutely nothing you can do . You can try to fight it , but I do n’t think it ’ll do much . ”
135565	135573	135574	135574	Myla	188	“ I might be overstepping a bit , ”
135577	135596	135574	135574	Myla	188	“ but it almost seems like you might have the same feelings about him . Am I right ? ”
135597	135606	135607	135607	I	0	“ I ’ve never truly thought about it , ”
135610	135738	135607	135607	I	0	“ I always just considered him my friend . But this past week or so , it ’s been different . He ’s looked at me differently . He ’s told me how beautiful I am . He ’s said it before , but this was . . . it was as if he meant it from a different place . And then he started touching me lightly , here and there . Like this night when I felt really sad about losing my parents and asked him to hold me . We were in his bed , and nothing happened , but his hand did wander along my hip . I did n’t think much of it then , but after the night we got drunk — ”
135739	135742	135746	135746	her	96	“ Whoa . ”
135749	135758	135746	135746	her	96	“ What happened the night you got drunk ? ”
135759	135770	135771	135771	I	0	“ I ’m surprised your husbands did n’t tell you . ”
135784	135859	135771	135771	I	0	“ It was the day I broke things off with Brian . Breaker and I went to celebrate , and we both got drunk and went to bed . We were playfully fighting over his pillow , and then he cuddled into me . I asked him if that was how he would hold his girlfriend , and he said no and then proceeded to show me exactly how he would touch his girlfriend . ”
135860	135868	135877	135877	her	188	“ And how did he show you ? ”
135889	135917	135877	135877	her	188	“ With teasing touches . He ’d slowly move his hand to just below my breasts and then slip his hand past the waistband of my shorts . ”
135918	135923	135926	135926	herself	113	“ Oh dear God . ”
135928	135936	135926	135926	herself	113	“ Did the teasing lead to anything ? ”
135943	135958	135926	135926	herself	113	“ I , uh , I ended up dry - humping him to completion . ”
135959	135964	135965	135965	Lottie	96	“ Both of you ? ”
135972	135994	135965	135965	Lottie	96	“ Well . . . that ’s it then , you just opened it all up for him to take control . ”
135995	135998	135999	135999	Kelsey	113	“ Yup , ”
136002	136032	135999	135999	Kelsey	113	“ And then with the towel thing . He has his mind set , and you need to decide if you ’re going to let it happen or not . ”
136033	136052	136053	136053	He	1667	“ I . . . I really do n’t know . I do n’t want to lose him . ”
136120	136167	136115	136115	I	0	“ If what you say is true , and he ’s trying to coax me into a relationship , what happens if he does n’t believe we work ? As a couple ? I do n’t think I could manage him not being in my life . ”
136168	136182	136183	136183	Kelsey	113	“ Sometimes the best relationship comes from a strong friendship as the foundation , ”
136186	136219	136183	136183	Kelsey	113	“ That ’s how it was with me and JP . We got really close , and I thought he was a great friend . Crossing that line felt natural to me . ”
136220	136229	136230	136230	I	0	“ It does n’t feel natural to me , ”
136238	136255	136235	136235	her	96	“ I think Breaker is going to help you see just how natural it can be . ”
136322	136324	136318	136318	Lia	168	“ play ”
136399	136402	136403	136403	Breaker	68	“ Hey , ”
136450	136454	136421	136421	him	68	“ Smells good . ”
136455	136460	136461	136461	I	0	“ Oh , thanks , ”
136571	136578	136568	136568	he	68	“ Want me to grab drinks ? ”
136579	136584	136568	136568	he	68	“ Uh , yeah . ”
136588	136594	136568	136568	he	68	“ That would be helpful . ”
136595	136598	136599	136599	He	68	“ Okay . ”
136617	136626	136602	136602	his	68	“ You smell amazing , by the way . ”
136718	136724	136725	136725	he	68	“ How was your day ? ”
136736	136741	136742	136742	I	0	“ It was fine , ”
136749	136753	136754	136754	he	68	“ Just fine ? ”
136765	136773	136754	136754	he	68	“ Yeah , nothing too exciting happened . ”
136774	136784	136785	136785	he	68	“ Well , we ’ll have to change that , ”
136801	136811	136793	136793	I	0	“ I got this . You go sit down . ”
136812	136821	136822	136822	He	68	“ You do n’t have to , Breaker . ”
136838	136843	136835	136835	he	68	“ I want to . ”
136969	136974	136959	136959	He	68	“ Need anything else ? ”
136975	136984	136985	136985	I	0	“ Uh , I do n’t think so , ”
137002	137010	136995	136995	He	68	“ Let me know if you do . ”
137046	137049	137050	137050	he	68	“ Problem ? ”
137053	137065	137050	137050	he	68	“ Your , uh , your hand is on my thigh . ”
137066	137071	137087	137087	his	68	“ And . . . ”
137072	137080	137081	137081	I	0	“ Is it supposed to be there ? ”
137091	137101	137102	137102	He	68	“ As a matter of fact , it is . ”
137177	137190	137191	137191	he	68	“ Are n’t you going to ask me how my day was ? ”
137204	137210	137194	137194	I	0	“ How was your day ? ”
137211	137270	137316	137316	Breaker	68	“ Pretty good . We had a company - wide meeting to go over the Shoemacher case , and then we fielded questions . It took up a great deal of the day . We split up the questions by department so we did n’t keep people waiting . I was glad to be back in the office . ”
137271	137279	137280	137280	He	68	“ That ’s good . You happy ? ”
137288	137291	137280	137280	He	68	“ Very . ”
137309	137315	137316	137316	Breaker	68	“ I can do those , ”
137377	137383	137389	137389	he	68	“ I can handle it . ”
137384	137388	137389	137389	he	68	“ You sure ? ”
137407	137410	137411	137411	I	0	“ Yes , ”
137457	137472	137441	137441	He	68	“ I have no problem cleaning up . You did cook , after all . ”
137494	137504	137473	137473	His	68	“ I . . . I can do it . ”
137505	137508	137509	137509	He	68	“ Okay . ”
137516	137523	137524	137524	He	68	“ I ’ll get dessert ready . ”
137789	137792	137785	137785	I	0	“ Breaker ? ”
137793	137797	137798	137798	he	68	“ In here , ”
137883	137888	137889	137889	I	0	“ What ’s this ? ”
137919	137923	137924	137924	he	68	“ Bath time , ”
138019	138023	138024	138024	he	68	“ Turn around , ”
138134	138141	138142	138142	he	68	“ You ’re so fucking addicting , ”
138179	138182	138183	138183	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
138190	138199	138183	138183	I	0	“ You like that , do n’t you ? ”
138236	138272	138273	138273	I	0	“ Good . Now listen closely , Lia . I ’m going to need you to slip into the bathtub , rest your head on the end , and spread your legs . Got it ? ”
138297	138303	138281	138281	He	68	“ How does that feel ? ”
138304	138307	138308	138308	I	0	“ Amazing , ”
138315	138318	138319	138319	He	68	“ Good . ”
138392	138402	138383	138383	he	68	“ Have you ever used one of these before ? ”
138403	138408	138409	138409	I	0	“ N - No , ”
138413	138418	138409	138409	I	0	“ It ’s simple . ”
138440	138457	138419	138419	He	68	“ You just stick this inside your delicious pussy and let it do all the work . ”
138458	138465	138488	138488	he	68	“ I - In the tub ? ”
138466	138469	138470	138470	He	68	“ Yes . ”

140979	140986	140987	140987	she	96	“ Seemed like a croissant moment , ”
141009	141015	141016	141016	Kelsey	113	“ What ’s going on ? ”
141028	141045	141025	141025	I	0	“ You guys were right . He has a plan , and he ’s executing it . ”
141065	141078	141062	141062	she	96	“ The Cane men always have a plan . . . always . ”
141079	141083	141084	141084	Myla	188	“ What happened ? ”
141123	141141	141142	141142	Lottie	96	“ Wait , he had a dildo with a remote and then put you in the tub ? ”
141155	141181	141152	141152	I	0	“ Yes . And let me tell you , never in my life have I ever done anything like that . Not even by myself . ”
141182	141191	141192	141192	Lottie	96	“ I knew he was the kinkier one , ”
141195	141204	141205	141205	I	0	“ That ’s not even the kinkiest part , ”
141218	141223	141213	141213	her	188	“ Please tell us . ”
141224	141244	141245	141246	The girls	551	“ Uh , well , he told me to suck him off while the vibrator was still inside me . ”
141254	141259	141260	141260	I	0	“ And I did , ”
141268	141274	141263	141263	Lottie	96	“ How was his dick ? ”
141275	141281	141282	141283	The girls	551	“ Like a freaking log . ”
141290	141324	141282	141283	The girls	551	“ Seriously , it was so big . I told him that was n’t fitting inside me , and he told me how his cock was perfect for my . . . cunt . ”
141325	141330	141331	141331	Kelsey	113	“ He said that ? ”
141334	141356	141331	141331	Kelsey	113	“ Man , I do n’t know if I ’m going to be able to look at Breaker the same way . ”
141357	141367	141368	141368	Myla	188	“ I do n’t think any of us will , ”
141371	141375	141376	141376	Lottie	96	“ Quick question , ”
141384	141391	141376	141376	Lottie	96	“ Did you suck him off ? ”
141406	141418	141403	141403	I	0	“ I did and . . . I really liked it . ”
141419	141423	141424	141424	Lottie	96	“ Thatta girl , ”
141431	141438	141424	141424	Lottie	96	“ So what ’s the problem ? ”
141442	141520	141424	141424	Lottie	96	“ The problem is , everything still feels weird . Like when we ’re in the moment , nothing is weird about it . It ’s so natural . And sure , he stuns me with what he says and what he wants me to do , but after . . . after is what ’s killing me . And when I talked to him about it last night , he told me to stop overthinking everything . ”
141521	141526	141527	141527	Kelsey	113	“ He ’s right , ”
141530	141540	141527	141527	Kelsey	113	“ You need to just live in the moment . ”
141541	141545	141549	141549	she	188	“ I agree , ”
141556	141587	141549	141549	she	188	“ It sounds like he ’s trying to normalize it all , and if you ’re resistant , it ’s going to make it hard for him to do that . ”
141588	141602	141603	141603	Kelsey	113	“ The big question is , do you want something more with him ? ”
141670	141676	141677	141677	I	0	“ I think I do , ”
141680	141686	141677	141677	I	0	“ But that terrifies me . ”
141687	141690	141691	141691	Lottie	96	“ Understandable , ”
141694	141713	141691	141691	Lottie	96	“ But you know Breaker wo n’t do anything to hurt you , ever . He cherishes you . ”
141714	141719	141720	141720	Kelsey	113	“ He really does , ”
141723	141733	141720	141720	Kelsey	113	“ Pretty much worships the ground you walk on . ”
141734	141749	141750	141750	Lottie	96	“ And he ’s intending to make something so much more of you two , ”
141753	141765	141766	141766	I	0	“ I guess so . But . . . the weirdness , ”
141769	141777	141766	141766	I	0	“ Then do n’t make it weird , ”
141782	141811	141778	141778	Myla	188	“ Take charge . Do n’t let him lead the way . Surprise him and initiate something yourself . Maybe that will take the weird out of it . ”
141812	141818	141819	141819	Lottie	96	“ Ooo , good idea , ”
141822	141830	141819	141819	Lottie	96	“ Oh , that makes me sweaty , ”
141834	141866	141831	141831	I	0	“ I ’ve initiated many times before , but Breaker is just so much more experienced than I am . I ’d feel like an idiot if I tried to initiate . ”
141867	141891	141892	141892	Myla	188	“ All you have to do is walk up to him and grab his penis , and he ’ll be good to go , ”
141900	141910	141892	141892	Myla	188	“ Yeah , I might need more than that . ”
141911	141919	141920	141920	Kelsey	113	“ So you ’re open to initiation ? ”
141923	141964	141920	141920	Kelsey	113	“ I think so . I mean , it makes sense . If I want something , I need to move forward on it as well , and maybe it will be less awkward if I take the first step . ”
141965	141970	141971	141971	Myla	188	“ I think so . ”
141976	141990	141973	141973	her	188	“ Oh , I know . You can send him a dirty text . ”
141991	141994	141995	141995	Lottie	96	“ Yes . ”
142003	142037	141995	141995	Lottie	96	“ A dirty text . That ’s perfect . You can hide behind the keyboard so you do n’t have to face the initial awkwardness , but you can also control the conversation . ”
142038	142045	142046	142046	Kelsey	113	“ That is a great idea , ”
142050	142073	142046	142046	Kelsey	113	“ What should it say ? Something that will really grab his attention . Like . . . I like your penis . ”
142079	142093	142076	142076	her	96	“ Excuse my sister . She ’s not that good at dirty talk . ”
142099	142107	142096	142096	her	113	“ Okay , what would you type ? ”
142108	142159	142164	142164	Myla	188	“ Well , since you ’re putting me on the spot , I ’m not going to be as eloquent as if I took some time to really think about it . But she could say something like . . . I ’m so horny just thinking about last night . ”
142160	142163	142164	142164	Myla	188	“ Better , ”
142171	142195	142168	142168	her	188	“ But not good enough . We need something that would match Breaker ’s style , something that would really grab his attention . ”
142212	142216	142209	142209	her	188	“ Got it . ”
142217	142221	142222	142222	Lottie	96	“ Please share , ”
142232	142247	142222	142222	Lottie	96	“ Plain and simple . . . I want to sit on your face . ”
142248	142251	142252	142252	I	0	“ What ? ”
142265	142268	142269	142269	Lottie	96	“ Yessss , ”
142273	142286	142269	142269	Lottie	96	“ God , Huxley goes insane when I say stuff like that . ”
142287	142294	142295	142295	Kelsey	113	“ JP loves that as well , ”
142298	142308	142309	142309	I	0	“ You guys would text that to your men ? ”
142314	142317	142318	142318	Lottie	96	“ Yup . ”
142324	142345	142318	142318	Lottie	96	“ Watch . I ’ll text him right now and show you his response . We should all do it . ”
142346	142354	142360	142360	her	188	“ I have no problem with that , ”
142375	142381	142382	142382	Lottie	96	“ Seconds , just wait , ”
142400	142418	142395	142395	she	96	“ I said , I want to sit on your face , and he responded . . . ”
142424	142430	142419	142419	She	96	“ Get home . Now ! ”
142439	142470	142431	142431	Kelsey	113	“ That would be my husband . And he said , ‘ babe , you know your pussy has a permanent reservation , party of one on my face . ’ ”
142489	142522	142481	142481	She	96	“ Ryot texted a tongue and three drops of water . As well as , ‘ when you get home , strip down , I ’ll be waiting in the bedroom . ’ ”
142556	142562	142553	142553	she	96	“ She ’s doing it . ”
142639	142645	142646	142646	Kelsey	113	“ What did you say ? ”
142649	142663	142646	142646	Kelsey	113	“ I just said hey , figured I ’d work him in first . ”
142676	142685	142669	142669	I	0	“ Hey , was just thinking about you . ”
142686	142697	142698	142698	Kelsey	113	“ Ooo , ask him what he was thinking about , ”
142717	142733	142713	142713	My	0	“ About how I want to see you tonight . Come over to my place ? ”

142815	142821	142822	142822	Lottie	96	“ Guaranteed he wo n’t , ”
142825	142833	142822	142822	Lottie	96	“ He ’ll love it so much . ”

143842	143845	143846	143846	she	168	“ What ? ”
143854	143870	143846	143846	she	168	“ Huxley apparently has a soft spot , and I ’m not talking about Lottie . ”
143871	143877	143807	143807	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
143878	143881	143882	143882	I	0	“ Well , ”
143909	143929	143906	143906	I	0	“ Huxley was in his office , and JP walked in on him and saw his eyes were teary . ”

143954	143978	143906	143906	I	0	“ I know , that ’s what I said . And when JP asked him what was going on , Huxley shut down . ”
143979	143991	143906	143906	I	0	“ Yeah , as if the man would share his feelings . ”
143992	143995	143996	143996	I	0	“ Exactly , ”
144008	144097	144002	144002	Lia	168	“ But you know JP , he ’s relentless , and he irritated Huxley so much that he finally spilled and said he was watching a video Lottie sent him of a baby hearing for the first time after not being able to hear since birth . Huxley ended up showing JP the video , and they teared up together . Then of course JP donated half a million dollars to a foundation that helps families who ca n’t afford the equipment needed to help their children hear . ”
144098	144108	144109	144109	Lia	168	“ Oh my God , that ’s so sweet , ”
144112	144131	144109	144109	Lia	168	“ I thought you were going to say something ridiculous like . . . JP ’s pigeon craze . ”
144132	144143	144144	144144	I	0	“ That ’s where I thought it was going too , ”
144172	144195	144160	144160	I	0	“ But I was surprised to hear that it was about a kid . It makes me think they ’re hiding something . ”
144196	144202	144203	144203	she	168	“ What do you mean ? ”
144206	144219	144203	144203	she	168	“ I do n’t know . I think Lottie might be pregnant . ”

144240	144265	144203	144203	she	168	“ Yeah , but JP also said he ’s seen some nonalcoholic knockoffs . Or she ’s skipped the booze portion of the drink . ”
144292	144312	144269	144269	she	168	“ No , she ca n’t be pregnant . I ’m sure I would have been able to tell . ”

144353	144407	144408	144408	I	0	“ I really do n’t . I think she is . The signs are there . Huxley has been extra protective around her lately . More than usual . And he ’s canceled a few appointments . JP told me about it . He thinks they ’ve been going to see the doctor . ”
144422	144451	144416	144416	she	168	“ I ca n’t fathom it , Huxley being a father . Then again , I never , and I mean never , thought he would get married . ”
144487	144506	144470	144470	my	0	“ But here he is , proving me wrong with every turn . Lottie really has domesticated him . ”

144534	144551	144531	144531	Lia	168	“ And Kelsey , for that matter . Are she and JP trying to get pregnant ? ”
144552	144594	144470	144470	my	0	“ I did n’t ask , but from the look in JP ’s eyes when he was talking about Lottie possibly being pregnant , I could see the desire in his eyes . I think JP would make a great dad . ”
144595	144602	144603	144603	She	168	“ I think so as well . ”
144611	144637	144605	144605	her	168	“ I like gossiping about your siblings . They present such an austere image that seeing behind the scenes of these powerful men is fun . ”

144682	144714	144715	144715	Her	168	“ That the first night you came to my dorm , I told myself halfway through Scrabble that I was going to ask you out when all was said and done . ”
144722	144729	144715	144715	Her	168	“ No , you were n’t . ”

144761	144791	144792	144792	She	168	“ Because you said you wanted a friend , and I did n’t want to ruin our connection , so I said okay , I ’ll be your friend . ”
144799	144813	144794	144794	her	168	“ So why now ? Why have you changed that way of thinking ? ”
144814	144817	144818	144818	I	0	“ Because , ”
144838	144866	144867	144867	My	0	“ I realized that seeing you marry another man was my absolute worst - case scenario because I have deep - rooted feelings for you , Lia . ”

145060	145074	145075	145075	I	0	“ I ’m still trying to wrap my head around it as well , ”
145137	145156	145157	145157	She	168	“ Tell me this , Lia , how did you like having my cock in your mouth yesterday ? ”
145163	145173	145157	145157	She	168	“ I liked it . . . a lot . ”

148221	148277	148197	148197	I	0	“ Does n’t it seem obvious ? That I should just be with you and not have any reservations holding me back ? You ’re the clear choice , yet I ’m so scared to take that step toward dating , because that would mean . . . that would mean our friendship is over . ”
148278	148286	148287	148287	I	0	“ Uh . . . excuse me ? ”
148290	148300	148287	148287	I	0	“ What do you mean our friendship is over ? ”
148301	148353	148197	148197	I	0	“ If we take that first step toward dating , Breaker , then this could end in two vastly different ways . We are together forever , which just seems crazy to even think about . Or we break up , and I doubt we can be friends after breaking up . ”
148359	148370	148354	148354	I	0	“ Why does being together forever seem crazy to you ? ”
148371	148418	148287	148287	I	0	“ Well , do you even want to get married one day ? Ever since I ’ve known you , you have n’t had a serious girlfriend , so is that something you want ? Does n’t getting involved with me freak you out at all ? ”
148419	148425	148426	148426	I	0	“ Not in the slightest , ”
148429	148453	148426	148426	I	0	“ And I think it ’s because in my mind , I ’ve always been with you . You ’ve always been mine . ”

148535	148583	148529	148529	I	0	“ Now , if you want to go back to your place and sleep , you are more than welcome to . Just borrow some pants of mine first . If you want to stay here , that ’s good too . But the choice is yours . ”
148584	148591	148592	148592	she	1733	“ I want to stay here , ”
148600	148613	148595	148595	her	1733	“ Then let ’s get ready for bed because I ’m exhausted . ”
148700	148704	148686	148686	I	0	“ You good ? ”
148705	148708	148709	148709	she	1733	“ Very , ”

148799	148828	148765	148765	I	0	“ I know , but can it not be some awkward date where you wear a suit and I get dressed up ? That ’s not really us . ”
148829	148853	148741	148741	she	1733	“ Trust me , I know . I have something entirely different planned . Something I ’ve been thinking about for a while . ”
148854	148861	148741	148741	she	1733	“ Really ? What is it ? ”
148862	148868	148869	148869	I	0	“ It ’s a surprise . ”
148877	148883	148869	148869	I	0	“ Now go to sleep . ”

148897	148900	148901	148901	I	0	“ Yup . ”
148909	148921	148901	148901	I	0	“ But block out your day tomorrow because you ’re mine . ”
148922	148927	148928	148928	she	1733	“ The whole day ? ”
148931	148965	148928	148928	she	1733	“ Yes . The whole day . I might not make you dress fancy , but I ’m still going to make a lasting impression . Consider this your last first date ever . ”

148997	149004	149005	149005	I	0	“ Is the blindfold really necessary ? ”

149026	149050	148901	148901	I	0	“ And dressing me yourself , was that necessary ? Or did you just do that so you could play with my boobs ? ”

You came back to my dorm and bitched about how guys are such idiots , and they do n’t know how to conduct a real first date . I asked you what would be your perfect first date , and you said Disneyland . You would test the guy to see if he would wear matching shirts . If he did , it was a check in the plus column . ”

152165	152168	152169	152169	he	1775	“ True , ”
152172	152190	152169	152169	he	1775	“ So if you ’re looking for faults , I have something for you to chew on . ”
152191	152201	152144	152144	I	0	“ Oh yeah , is it a real thing ? ”
152202	152221	152222	152222	he	1775	“ Very real . I think about this all the time and how I could have done better , ”
152225	152233	152222	152222	he	1775	“ Okay , let me hear it . ”
152245	152267	152234	152234	I	0	“ One of my greatest faults would be not asking you out on a date the first night I met you . ”
152273	152279	152234	152234	I	0	“ Come on , Breaker . ”
152280	152285	152286	152286	he	1775	“ I ’m serious , ”
152310	152430	152307	152307	he	1775	“ Ever since I got a taste of you , I keep thinking about how I ’m such an idiot for not asking you out sooner , for not making a move earlier . I ca n’t believe I waited this long to hold your hand , to have you in my bed . It makes me feel like a real fucking idiot . And all those years of not having a girlfriend , it ’s because of you . Because I had deep - rooted feelings for you that I was n’t allowing myself to feel . So yeah , there ’s my fault , being a legitimate idiot when it comes to how I feel about you . ”
152431	152436	152437	152437	I	0	“ Wow , okay , ”
152448	152547	152437	152437	I	0	“ I do n’t know if we would have the same relationship that we do now . I probably would n’t have been as open with you about certain things if I was looking for something romantic . When you ’re just friends , it ’s as if you can drop all the walls and be yourself , but when you ’re trying to be romantic with someone , you almost put on this façade to show that you ’re good enough to be with that person . I ’ve sort of felt that way recently with you . ”
152548	152551	152552	152552	he	1776	“ Why ? ”
152563	152608	152552	152552	he	1776	“ It ’s nothing huge , just subtle things , but I ’ve had some self - conscious moments , and I just think it comes with the territory when someone is more sexually experienced . I mean , this past week , Breaker . ”
152613	152638	152552	152552	he	1776	“ I have never done half the things we ’ve done . I did n’t even know that kind of sexuality was in me . ”
152639	152647	152648	152648	he	1776	“ Do you still feel that way ? ”
152651	152669	152648	152648	he	1776	“ Sometimes . You ’re just . . . I do n’t know , it ’s stupid . ”
152684	152690	152691	152691	he	1776	“ I ’m just what ? ”
152712	152802	152709	152709	I	0	“ You ’re not the same nerdy guy from college . Sure , if I was able to look past the mustache back then and the floppy hair , I probably would have been intimidated , but I was n’t because you were goofy , and I loved that about you . Now that you ’re all grown up and . . . you know . . . muscular , there ’s an intimidating factor to your transformation . I do n’t feel like I ’m in your league . ”
152803	152814	152709	152709	I	0	“ Jesus , you ca n’t be serious , Lia . ”
152815	152879	152880	152880	He	1777	“ I know , I said it was stupid , but it ’s hard not to feel that way when the guy who is . . . well , whatever this is between us , when he ’s gorgeous , rich , and extremely well endowed with the kind of experience that would make any woman blush . I do n’t feel worthy . ”
152895	153025	152889	152889	his	1777	“ I ca n’t tell you how to feel , and those feelings are something I will help you work through , but I want you to know this right here and now . I ’m the one who feels lucky , okay ? I ’m the one who feels like they ’re trying to dig their claws into you so you do n’t run away . That insecurity lives heavily in my heart as well . I fear you ’ll wake up one day and realize that you made a mistake , that you miss Brian , that you should never have called off the wedding . Or that maybe I ’m the rebound guy , that I should n’t have made a move on you so soon . ”
153026	153037	152889	152889	his	1777	“ Breaker , you know that ’s not the case . ”
153038	153081	153158	153158	his	1778	“ I want to believe that , but in my head , I know I did n’t go about this the right way . I did n’t pursue you appropriately , normally . I should have eased more into the sexual aspect . ”
153082	153090	153091	153091	I	0	“ Why did you jump in headfirst ? ”
153094	153149	153091	153091	I	0	“ Because I wanted to show you that there was chemistry between us . I did n’t want to give you an inkling that there was n’t . And frankly , I wanted you . I want you . Badly , Lia . The moment you put on that wedding dress , everything changed . ”
153212	153226	153199	153199	his	1778	“ You look . . . fuck , you look stunning , Ophelia . ”
153227	153239	153182	153182	Breaker	68	“ I think everything changed in me at that moment too . ”
153243	153248	153249	153249	Breaker	68	“ I hate you , ”
153283	153290	153291	153291	I	0	“ Why do you hate me ? ”
153303	153319	153294	153294	His	68	“ You know I despise that godforsaken ride . It ’s death waiting to happen . ”
153320	153328	153329	153329	I	0	“ It ’s a kid ’s ride , ”
153336	153356	153357	153357	He	68	“ That is not a fucking kid ’s ride , that is . . . that is a nightmare . ”
153370	153380	153364	153364	Jorge	216	“ Can I get you some water , Breaker ? ”
153381	153388	153389	153389	I	0	“ Oh , he ’s fine , ”
153398	153411	153393	153393	Breaker	68	“ Water would be amazing . Thank you so much , Jorge . ”
153412	153421	153423	153423	Jorge	216	“ Not a problem . Be right back . ”
153452	153462	153449	153449	he	68	“ You ’re going to pay for that later . ”
153463	153483	153449	153449	he	68	“ Why ? I did n’t force you to go on the ride . That was your own choice . ”
153484	153501	153502	153502	He	68	“ You taunted me and then pleaded . As if I can fucking deny you anything . ”
153529	153537	153502	153502	He	68	“ You knew I hated that ride . ”
153538	153551	153559	153559	his	68	“ I would have been just fine riding that on my own . ”
153552	153555	153556	153556	He	68	“ Bullshit . ”
153565	153588	153556	153556	He	68	“ Jesus , you ’re such a liar . Face the facts , Lia , you ’re going to pay for that . ”
153589	153600	153601	153601	I	0	“ What are you going to do ? Spank me ? ”
153616	153655	153608	153608	his	68	“ Yeah , I might just fucking spank you . I ’ll spank you so hard that your pussy is drenched , begging for my dick , and then . . . I ’ll leave you completely unsatisfied . ”
153660	153669	153608	153608	his	68	“ You . . . you would n’t . ”
153670	153707	153711	153711	God	199	“ And then , when you ’re lying there , restless , your cunt throbbing for release , I ’ll make myself come all over your beautiful sloped back just to remind you who owns you . ”
153713	153720	153721	153721	Jorge	216	“ Here you go , Breaker , ”
153751	153759	153760	153760	He	216	“ Thank you so much , Jorge . ”

153775	153812	153843	153843	his	216	“ Me too . My niece loves it , and whenever I bring her here , it ’s a requirement . I think she ’s testing my love every time she makes me go on it . ”
153813	153828	153843	153843	his	216	“ I think Lia is doing the same . . . testing my love . ”
153991	153999	154000	154000	Breaker	68	“ You ready for the next ride ? ”
154003	154017	154000	154000	Breaker	68	“ I think we ’re headed over to The Little Mermaid , right ? ”
154024	154032	154018	154018	I	0	“ Yup , I believe we are . ”
154046	154051	154052	154052	Jorge	216	“ Right this way , ”
154281	154295	154296	154296	Jorge	216	“ Fireworks should be starting shortly . Can I get you anything else ? ”
154299	154314	154315	154315	Jorge	216	“ No , thank you , I think we can take it from here . ”
154318	154332	154333	154333	Breaker	68	“ And you have your pass to get back to your parking lot ? ”
154336	154339	154340	154340	He	68	“ Yup . ”
154354	154367	154344	154344	his	68	“ Thank you so much for everything . You have been fantastic . ”
154368	154403	154344	154344	his	68	“ Of course . Thank you , Breaker . Miss Lia , it was a joy meeting you . Before I leave , can I offer to take one more pic of you two ? ”
154404	154418	154344	154344	his	68	“ Nah , I think we ’re good . Thank you , though . ”

154470	154479	154467	154467	He	68	“ What ? He did a good job . ”
154480	154488	154451	154451	Breaker	68	“ You probably just made his day . ”
154489	154512	154513	154513	He	68	“ Yeah , well , it ’s the least I can do after he made this day so special for us both . ”

162924	162932	162933	162933	I	0	“ I want to do that again . ”
162936	162955	162956	162956	She	1884	“ Okay , just give me a second . Got to , you know . . . recharge . ”

162999	163006	163007	163007	I	0	“ It ’s very much real , ”
163014	163029	163030	163030	Her	1884	“ Everything about you and me is real . The best kind of real . ”
163037	163051	163030	163030	Her	1884	“ You ’re not going to get sick of me , are you ? ”
163052	163084	162966	162966	her	1884	“ You kidding me with that ? If I have n’t gotten sick of you over this last decade , I ’m certain I wo n’t get sick of you now . ”
163085	163092	162966	162966	her	1884	“ But relationship me is different . ”
163093	163097	163098	163098	I	0	“ How so ? ”
163101	163107	163098	163098	I	0	“ You seem the same . ”
163108	163114	162966	162966	her	1884	“ I ’m very clingy . ”
163115	163125	163126	163126	She	1884	“ When it ’s you , I love clingy . ”
163129	163137	163126	163126	She	1884	“ I ’m also apparently very horny . ”
163138	163151	162966	162966	her	1884	“ Once again , when it ’s you , horny is amazing . ”
163152	163169	162966	162966	her	1884	“ And demanding , I ’m going to need to hold your hand on all outings . ”
163170	163177	163126	163126	She	1884	“ I think I ’ll manage . ”
163178	163191	162966	162966	her	1884	“ And I ’ll require at least one date night a week . ”
163192	163205	163206	163206	She	1884	“ Am I only allowed one , or can I have more ? ”
163209	163219	163206	163206	She	1884	“ You can have as many as you want . ”
163220	163223	163224	163224	I	0	“ Good . ”
163279	163289	163290	163290	she	1884	“ Why are you looking at me like that ? ”

163319	163331	163332	163332	She	1884	“ Maybe because I have heart eyes when you ’re around . ”
163339	163345	163332	163332	She	1884	“ Do n’t be lame . ”
163361	163382	163346	163346	I	0	“ I ’m never lame , but if you think I am , then maybe you should just walk away . ”

163607	163615	163594	163594	I	0	“ It ’s just a regular dress . ”
163616	163624	163625	163625	he	68	“ That is not a regular dress , ”
163641	163661	163625	163625	he	68	“ You do n’t normally wear dresses , so is there some special occasion I do n’t know about ? ”

163743	163776	163785	163785	he	68	“ You ’re a grown man , Breaker . You can decide what you want to do with your life . I do n’t need to wear a dress to tempt you . ”

165080	165110	165116	165116	I	0	“ My assistant quit on me , for good reason . I ’ve been a tyrant lately , so I came here to pick up some supplies I needed . ”
165111	165114	165065	165066	The Beave	111	“ Oh . ”
165119	165128	165116	165116	I	0	“ Does n’t your office carry that stuff ? ”
165129	165144	165116	165116	I	0	“ They do , but there are some specific things they do n’t carry . ”

165196	165208	165149	165149	I	0	“ It ’s an unhealthy obsession I ’m okay with having . ”
165209	165217	165218	165218	He	92	“ Could be worse , I guess . ”
165229	165244	165245	165245	I	0	“ Well , I ’m just going to get back to my toner shopping . ”
165251	165257	165258	165258	he	92	“ Have dinner with me , ”

165269	165272	165273	165273	he	92	“ Dinner , ”
165283	165294	165273	165273	he	92	“ I just . . . I want to talk . ”
165295	165298	165276	165276	his	92	“ Oh . ”
165305	165327	165299	165299	I	0	“ Well , Brian , I do n’t think that ’s a good idea . I ’m sort of seeing someone . ”
165328	165332	165333	165333	he	92	“ You are ? ”
165343	165352	165333	165333	he	92	“ Let me guess . . . Breaker . ”
165361	165394	165358	165358	I	0	“ Nothing happened until after you and I broke up , I swear , Brian . He never made a move on me , ever . I need you to know that . ”
165398	165403	165395	165395	He	92	“ I believe you . ”
165434	165439	165425	165425	Breaker	68	“ So . . . ”
165440	165452	165453	165453	he	92	“ I still want to have dinner or even just coffee , ”
165456	165467	165468	165468	He	92	“ I just . . . well fuck , Lia . ”
165474	165499	165468	165468	He	92	“ I just want to clear the air . I know you ’ve moved on , but I think I just need some closure . ”
165542	165548	165539	165539	I	0	“ Coffee would be fine . ”
165549	165573	165539	165539	I	0	“ Okay . Thanks . I ’ll , uh , I ’ll text you the details and leave you to your toner purchases . ”

166269	166276	166277	166277	Breaker	68	“ Where the hell are you ? ”
166286	166290	166291	166291	I	0	“ Back here , ”
166348	166355	166356	166356	he	68	“ Fuck , I missed you , ”
166364	166373	166374	166374	I	0	“ Hold . . . hold on there , ”
166377	166395	166374	166374	I	0	“ What do you mean hold on there ? I ’ve been waiting all day for this . ”
166406	166420	166421	166421	He	68	“ I know , I just , I have to go out tonight . ”
166427	166449	166421	166421	He	68	“ What do you mean you have to go out ? I thought I was all yours when I got back . ”
166450	166463	166421	166421	He	68	“ Something came up , and I need to meet a friend . ”
166464	166467	166468	166468	He	68	“ Oh . ”
166473	166477	166468	166468	He	68	“ Everything okay ? ”
166478	166481	166482	166482	My	0	“ Yeah . ”
166515	166529	166530	166530	He	68	“ Just an impromptu thing . Not sure when I ’ll be home . ”
166538	166552	166530	166530	He	68	“ Okay . Well , should I wait to have dinner with you ? ”
166553	166586	166587	166587	I	0	“ No , that ’s okay . Eat away . And do n’t feel like you need to hang out here . You can go back to your place if you want . ”
166623	166635	166636	166636	he	68	“ You seem uneasy . Are you sure everything is okay ? ”
166668	166682	166663	166663	I	0	“ Everything is great . I ’ll text you when I ’m home . ”
166683	166686	166687	166687	I	0	“ Okay . ”
166706	166724	166696	166696	he	68	“ You ’d tell me if something was wrong , right ? Like if I did anything ? ”
166753	166766	166767	166767	I	0	“ You did nothing . Okay ? I ’ll see you later . ”
166979	166986	166987	166987	I	0	“ Hey . . . Brian , ”
166995	167054	166987	166987	I	0	“ Hey . Thanks for coming . I , uh , I brought one of your dresses . It was delivered to my mom ’s house . Uh , apparently , the other two will be delivered next week . I thought you ’d want to take care of it . Maybe change the delivery address . . . ”
167055	167061	167062	167062	I	0	“ Oh , thank you , ”
167105	167121	167099	167099	Brian	100	“ Got you a cappuccino , thought it would be the best choice for you . ”
167168	167181	167164	167164	he	1930	“ I . . . I do n’t drink cappuccinos , Brian . ”
167182	167187	167188	167188	he	1930	“ Oh , sorry , ”
167195	167208	167188	167188	he	1930	“ I guess I do n’t really know what you would drink . ”
167209	167219	167220	167220	I	0	“ I think that was one of our problems , ”
167223	167235	167236	167236	he	1930	“ So we ’re just going to jump right into this ? ”
167239	167244	167245	167245	I	0	“ Might as well . ”
167248	167251	167245	167245	I	0	“ Okay . ”
167262	167273	167252	167252	He	1930	“ So I clearly did n’t know your coffee order . ”
167274	167281	167282	167282	I	0	“ It ’s not just that , ”
167285	167315	167282	167282	I	0	“ It ’s that I do n’t think you knew much about me at all . And I ’m not sure I knew a whole lot about you either . ”
167319	167335	167316	167316	He	1930	“ I think you ’re right , and I ’m probably to blame for that . ”
167339	167382	167336	167336	He	1930	“ I ’m seeing that I ’ve been so hell - bent on making something of myself and checking off all the boxes of what I need to do to get there that I do n’t think I ’ve actually been living . ”
167392	167445	167385	167385	his	1930	“ That day , when you walked away at the bakery , I was n’t even mad . I knew it was going to happen . I could feel the tension between us , I could feel you slipping away , and I knew there was no one to blame but myself . ”
167446	167454	167455	167455	I	0	“ I should have tried harder too , ”
167463	167547	167460	167460	his	1930	“ I know you , Lia . You ’re just trying to be nice right now , but please , the blame deserves to be placed on me . I drove you away . I became uninterested . I was n’t . . . hell , I was n’t even fully in this relationship when I proposed . I just did it because my mother was pressuring me . It was n’t right for you , and it was n’t right for me . ”
167548	167564	167565	167565	I	0	“ Would you have gone through with it if I had n’t called it off ? ”
167571	167617	167568	167568	He	1931	“ Yes . I would have , and I would have only made you more and more miserable because no way would I have ended it . I would have kept it going until you probably would n’t have been able to take it anymore . ”
167618	167621	167622	167622	I	0	“ Why ? ”
167625	167653	167622	167622	I	0	“ Because my parents have made it impossible to please them . Status is so important to them that I would have done anything to maintain that . ”
167654	167766	167568	167568	He	1931	“ I can understand that . I probably would have done anything to make my parents happy , and I think that ’s why I went out with you too . They never wanted me to be alone . When I went to college , they were so scared that I did n’t have anyone to lean on , like a sibling , so when I met Breaker , they were relieved . They knew he would always be by my side . When they passed shortly before I met you , I think I was trying to let them know that I ’d be okay , if that makes sense . ”
167767	167772	167773	167773	he	1932	“ It really does , ”
167785	167792	167776	167776	He	1932	“ Did you ever love me ? ”
167805	167811	167812	167812	I	0	“ Of course , Brian , ”
167816	167850	167812	167812	I	0	“ I loved you for so many reasons , I just do n’t think you and I were in love at the end . I think we were just going through the motions . ”
167851	167862	167812	167812	I	0	“ We were , and I ’m sorry about that . ”
167863	167868	167869	167869	I	0	“ Do n’t be , ”
167872	167896	167869	167869	I	0	“ I think I ’d have been madder if you ’d put in the effort , even though it was all a lie . ”
167897	167909	167812	167812	I	0	“ My love for you was n’t a lie , Lia . ”
167910	167928	167929	167929	He	1933	“ I ’m sorry , I said that wrong . I guess your intentions were a lie . ”
167937	167986	167929	167929	He	1933	“ You know , if things were different , if I did n’t have to live with this pressure , and I could be the man I truly am for you , the one you first met , I think we could have had a great life together . ”
167987	167993	167994	167994	I	0	“ We probably could have , ”
168028	168033	168019	168019	He	1933	“ Well , fuck . ”
168040	168058	168019	168019	He	1933	“ Are you happy , Lia ? With Breaker . . . does he make you happy ? ”
168071	168090	168059	168059	I	0	“ Yes , I ’m thrilled . It still does n’t feel real , but I ’m happy . ”
168091	168140	168019	168019	He	1933	“ I ’m glad . He ’s a good man , even though it might have seemed like we did n’t get along . You two always had a special connection that I was very jealous of , and I ’m sure that did n’t help our case . ”

168176	168212	168019	168019	He	1933	“ Are you going to allow yourself to be happy ? Or are you always going to look for what ’s next in your career ? What you can do to make your mother happy ? ”

168239	168296	168233	168233	His	1934	“ My brain is wired differently . I have this internal need to please and to accomplish , and if I ’m not doing one of those things every day , I feel itchy , out of control , like my life is falling apart . I ’m not sure happiness can fall within those parameters . ”
168297	168376	168377	168377	He	1935	“ I know this is n’t my place , but it might be helpful for you to talk to someone , a therapist , to help you work through those feelings . And maybe , to become stronger in yourself . I was so hurt when you did n’t stand up for me in front of your mother , and on behalf of your future Mrs. Brian , can I urge you to learn how to do that ? ”
168385	168412	168413	168413	His	1935	“ You ’re right . I know you are . I ’m sorry I did n’t do that . I need to find the courage first . ”

168755	168882	168713	168713	she	168	“ All day , I was pining to see my girl , and when I got home , she was on her way out . Said she had to meet someone , but who the fuck is she meeting ? I mean , we had plans , JP , not official , but I mean it was assumed we ’d be spending every goddamn second with each other when we ’re not working and she ’s not working , and I ’m not working , but she ’s not here because she ’s out somewhere and she was really fucking evasive about it , and now I ’m wondering if I ’m not good enough and if she found someone else that suits her fancy more . ”

168927	168988	168921	168921	I	0	“ Dude , listen , I ’m terrified , okay ? I feel like we ’re together , but something has blocked her from fully being with me , and I know it ’s just a feeling , but it ’s there , and this little stunt has pushed me over the goddamn edge . I ca n’t lose her . ”

169016	169059	169013	169013	I	0	“ Yeah , maybe I was a psycho and asked Ryot if Myla was with him , and maybe I asked Huxley , and maybe I called you to see where Kelsey was . She does n’t hang out with anyone else . ”

Maybe she had an embarrassing appointment and did n’t want to talk to you about it . Maybe . . . I do n’t know . She has to get a mole removed or something . ”
169108	169132	168725	168745	a needy little salamander of a man who requires to be next to her bouncy bosom at all times ? Fuck	1941	“ I have licked every inch of that woman ’s body . Trust me , there is nothing she needs to get removed . ”

169394	169452	169384	169384	I	0	“ So Kelsey asked me to pick up some mozzarella from a deli that she ’s obsessed with , and since she ’s pregnant and has n’t been able to keep food down lately , I ’d do just about anything to make her feel better , including driving twenty minutes to a deli to grab mozzarella . ”

169952	170008	169945	169945	I	0	“ Listen , I ’m sure there ’s a logical explanation about what ’s going on . Why do n’t you just wait for her , and when she gets home , you ask her ? Do n’t confront her . Do n’t blame her . Just ask her . Think you can do that ? ”

170025	170061	170062	170062	He	1946	“ And for the love of God , do n’t tell her I saw her and sent you a picture . That shit will get back to Kelsey , and she ’ll have my nuts . ”

171299	171387	171296	171296	She	1959	“ Anyway , he thought things ended abruptly and asked if we could just talk it out , find some closure . Basically , he wanted to apologize . At first , I was unsure . I told him to text me where to meet him , but after , I was uneasy about it . I was talking to Myla about whether I should go or not when I realized that it was n’t a question at all . I needed to meet up with him . ”
171388	171405	171406	171406	She	1959	“ To , uh . . . to see if you still had feelings for him ? ”

I was n’t giving him everything I had because this door with Brian was still open . I never truly got to close it . That ’s what tonight was about . Ending that chapter in my life so I can have a fresh start . . . with you . ”

171551	171577	171542	171542	She	1960	“ If I told you I was going to coffee with Brian , you would have flipped out . Do n’t even lie to me . ”
171584	171603	171578	171578	I	0	“ Yeah , that might have been true . But you could have told me you needed closure . ”
171604	171628	171642	171642	her	1960	“ I guess I was n’t one hundred percent positive about what I needed . But I ’m glad I figured it out . ”

171671	171709	171710	171710	She	1960	“ I ’m not convinced I was fully committed up until this point , and I can truly say I know what my feelings are . I know where they rest , and that ’s with you . ”
171720	171747	171710	171710	She	1960	“ I ’m in love with you , Breaker , and that might be too soon to say , but that ’s where I ’m at . ”

171804	171821	171822	171822	I	0	“ Shit , sorry . I did n’t mean to laugh at that . Poor timing . ”
171829	171894	171822	171822	I	0	“ I ’ve wanted to tell you I love you for some time now , but I ’ve held back because I did n’t want to freak you out .

171923	171988	171920	171920	I	0	“ Pathetically . To the point that I ’d have no shame in following you around even if you did get back with Brian . I ’m so fucking in love with you , Ophelia , that I can feel it all the way to the marrow of my bones . It ’s a part of me . You ’re a part of me . ”
