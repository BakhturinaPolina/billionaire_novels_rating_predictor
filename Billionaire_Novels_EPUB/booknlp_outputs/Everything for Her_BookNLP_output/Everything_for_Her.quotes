33394	33416	33385	33385	I	0	“ I see you ’re still learning that if you run , I chase . Stepping back wo n’t help you . ”
33519	33546	33500	33500	his	70	“ I like it when you do n’t run from me , but I have to say chasing and catching you has its appeal , also . ”
33623	33636	33614	33614	he	70	“ Fuck , you even look sexy first thing in the morning . ”
33680	33688	33668	33668	he	70	“ I ’m still mad at you . ”

You storming in the club and punching someone in the face in a jealous rage is going to get your ass on the fucking cover of some gossip column , you dumb shit . Not only that , but blow the plans you ’ve had in place for over four fucking years . Oh , and let ’s not forget that all the enemies you ’ve made owning Osbourne Corp are likely going to know you have a thing for Mallory . Now that ’s going to put her right in the fucking spotlight . You better hope no one got any pictures ! ”

70987	71025	70983	70983	Her	1400	“ I used to think I never told anyone because I was scared of him . Maybe I was , but I think it ’s more because I was ashamed . Ashamed I did n’t save her . ”

71475	71499	71465	71465	her	104	“ I wo n’t . I told him I was done with everything . Please do n’t tell him what I told you . ”
71500	71511	71512	71512	I	0	“ He does n’t know your dad killed your mother ? ”
71524	71532	71512	71512	I	0	“ This is my secret to keep . ”
71600	71623	71594	71594	I	0	“ I went up there because I think he ’s having me followed , and I was going to scream at him . ”
71624	71631	71632	71632	Paige	104	“ He ’s having you followed , ”
71635	71693	71694	71694	She	104	“ I ’m not on his side , but I know our father has gone after people close to Miles before , done things to hurt them in hopes of hurting Miles . Not to mention he ’s probably trying to keep the press off you . If some people find out what you mean to him ... ”
71700	71711	71694	71694	She	104	“ Well , I get why he ’s doing it . ”
71712	71721	71594	71594	I	0	“ How long has this been going on ? ”
71722	71788	71789	71789	She	104	“ I only know from when he asked me to keep an eye on you . He does n’t really talk to me about you . He does n’t say why he ’s doing it , so I can only guess . He always asks how you ’re doing , if you need anything , and of course , to keep men away from you . ”
71804	71884	71789	71789	She	104	“ At first I thought maybe you were connected to someone important and he was keeping an eye out or something . But every now and then , I ’d pick up flares of jealousy , and I started to think it was something different altogether . Not to mention I ’ve never seen him show interest in a woman before . Not even a drop . Then I saw you together and he was a totally different person . ”
71900	71908	71885	71885	I	0	“ I ’ll tell you , Mal . ”
71950	72003	72004	72004	She	1410	“ Miles is kind of cold except when he ’s with you , and the few times I ’ve seen him with his mom . He did n’t seem to do anything but work , but now here he is , running all over the goddamn place , giving Captain an aneurysm . ”
72023	72100	72013	72013	she	1410	“ So do I think he wants you ? Yes . In fact , I think he might be a little crazy about it . It ’s creepy how he can go from yelling at us to being all sweet and gushy with you at the drop of a hat . So with you , I ’m thinking he ’s a little crazy , but in other aspects of his life , he seems pretty normal . ”
72101	72106	72107	72107	I	0	“ That ’s reassuring , ”
72111	72308	72107	72107	I	0	“ I do n’t know what to tell you to do with that . I have trust issues and even worse issues when it comes to men . The rich ones are the worst , and it ’s been slowly eating away at me that I ca n’t get a solid read on Miles and what he ’s doing with you . I saw him as a rich man using his money to get what he wanted , but I let it go because we were so far away . He was n’t around , and to be honest , I did n’t think about it much . You and I went to school and we did us . That was , until we landed here . You got the internship . Then he and I started to have this back - and - forth struggle . I was n’t giving him the information he wanted anymore , and I think I made him miss a step . Like an addict who was n’t getting his fix anymore , so he showed up that night at the club and tipped his hand a little too soon . ”
72309	72316	72317	72317	I	0	“ I was falling for him , ”
72320	72330	72317	72317	I	0	“ I had sex with him . Unprotected sex . ”
72425	72431	72406	72406	Paige	104	“ Do you regret it ? ”
72432	72435	72436	72436	I	0	“ No . ”
72441	72525	72436	72436	I	0	“ It was wonderful , actually . He was so sweet and it was perfect . Until it was n’t . He makes me feel so important and special . Like he ’d do anything for me . That he ca n’t breathe without me . It ’s intoxicating to think someone feels that way about me , but it ’s overwhelming , too . I do n’t know what to do . I mean the man has been controlling my freaking life ! ”
72537	72582	72526	72526	I	0	“ You do n’t have to do anything right now . Not a damn thing . You want to talk to him ? Talk to him . If you do n’t , then do n’t . We ’ll go to work and do us . ”
72583	72594	72595	72595	I	0	“ Can ‘ doing us ’ be eating ice cream ? ”
72606	72612	72613	72613	Paige	104	“ You read my mind . ”

72637	72655	72628	72628	I	0	“ I did n’t really take much with me , so I ’m still kind of here . ”
72656	72665	72619	72619	her	104	“ Good , because I need your shoes . ”
72841	72851	72852	72852	I	0	“ Mallory and Paige are on their way down , ”

73472	73482	73483	73483	I	0	“ Paige is n’t going to work with us , ”
73494	73506	73483	73483	I	0	“ She ’s never really worked with me to begin with . ”

73574	73581	73582	73582	he	148	“ Did n’t want you to , ”
73665	73681	73682	73682	I	0	“ Besides , I ca n’t go firing your sister , now , can I ? ”
73768	73777	73778	73778	He	148	“ It ’s better to keep her here . ”
73797	73802	73794	73794	his	148	“ I suppose so . ”
73835	73880	73832	73832	his	148	“ You know , you look at the monitor about every ten seconds . If you ’re wondering if you have a tell . But I guess it does n’t matter with how you were staring at her through the whole meeting this morning . ”
73899	73911	73912	73912	I	0	“ You ’re supposed to be watching her , not me , ”
73919	73930	73916	73916	Ryan	148	“ Watching her means watching everyone who ’s watching her . ”

74065	74105	74062	74062	I	0	“ We ’ll need to be prepared for this . I know she ’ll keep an eye on her , but she wo n’t give me anything . Hell , she barely has since they arrived in New York . ”
74106	74158	74165	74165	him	1454	“ I ’m already on it . I ’ll make sure we have eyes on her if she is n’t in her apartment or office . But , sir , I ’d like to let Jordan do that . I should be on you . You ’re at higher risk and — ”

87279	87327	87272	87272	I	0	“ That ’s really good , baby , because I ’ve been thinking about the things I ’ve wanted to do to you for years . I ca n’t wait to tell you what I ’ll be doing to this body for the rest of our lives . ”

87599	87605	87606	87606	he	1675	“ You did n’t leave , ”
87632	87647	87614	87614	I	0	“ I could barely move with how you were wrapped around me last night . ”
87659	87662	87663	87663	he	1675	“ Sorry , ”
87697	87707	87688	87688	he	1675	“ I really do need to use the bathroom . ”
87759	87767	87768	87768	Oz	70	“ Fuck , I like seeing that . ”
87836	87839	87840	87840	I	0	“ Bathroom , ”

87896	87908	87909	87909	he	1675	“ You ’ll end up back in the bed , sweetheart , ”
87943	87949	87950	87950	He	1675	“ You can wear this . ”

88298	88358	88275	88275	He	1675	“ Hard not to smile when you ’re standing in our kitchen , in my shirt , looking like I made love to you all night . As long as you ’re not trying to slip out on me , I do n’t think there ’s anything you could be doing in here that wo n’t make me smile . ”

88636	88689	88690	88690	He	1675	“ Then when I see someone trying to move in on that , well , I slip . I get pissed , and something takes over . I know it ’s crazy , but I ca n’t seem to stop it , no matter how hard I try . I ca n’t . ”
88707	88715	88696	88696	he	1675	“ How long have you been waiting ? ”
88765	88800	88801	88801	I	0	“ I first saw you when you were in high school competing in the state math competition . I was in college at the time and was asked to be one of the judges . ”
88840	88844	88845	88845	I	0	“ Five years , ”

88898	88918	88919	88919	His	1675	“ Sometimes it feels like longer . I ca n’t seem to remember a time before you , really . ”
88934	88937	88929	88929	I	0	“ Why ? ”
89058	89109	89036	89036	He	70	“ I ’d gone to the competition because sometimes you have to rub shoulders with the right people to get places . Back then I had to do it a lot more because I was still making a name for myself . Trying to make my empire bigger and better . ”
89141	89179	89134	89134	Everyone	474	“ Mainly I was trying to be around some of the people I knew my father was close to . He went to Yale and so did a lot of the people he chose to work with . ”
89180	89187	89193	89193	he	70	“ You hate him , too . ”
89203	89223	89193	89193	he	70	“ Since I was eighteen and my mother told me all the horrible things he ’d done to her . ”
89244	89395	89396	89396	He	1699	“ I wanted to be like him . He was so smart and seemed like he knew what he was doing in the business world . I was intrigued and I always tried to make him proud . I was n’t seeing what was right in front of my face . How could I have not noticed how he ’d treated my mother ? She sobbed when she told me what he ’d done to her . And there was nothing I could do that day to make the tears stop . I never knew about how he abused her . I had n’t seen it before then , or maybe I could have done something sooner . But I sat there and listened to her tell me about their years together and that she was leaving him . And then I found out what he was truly capable of . ”
89408	89470	89398	89398	his	1699	“ There ’s so much about him you do n’t know . And I do n’t know if I can tell you . I do n’t want his dirt to get on you , Mallory . I promised myself I ’d never be that man , and even talking about it makes me fear I ’m pulling you into that world . ”
89507	89510	89511	89511	I	0	“ Oz . ”
89522	89535	89511	89511	I	0	“ It ’s not the same . You know that , right ? ”
89551	89630	89631	89631	His	1702	“ I told myself I ’d never be like him . I ’d never hurt the people I love . I ’d be better . I ’d give my mom a better life than he ever did , then I ’d make him regret ever making her cry even one of those tears , and that ’s what I did . I took my trust fund and poured my life into making sure he never hurt anyone again . ”
89644	89652	89653	89653	He	1702	“ Then you walked into my world . ”
89667	89897	89653	89653	He	1702	“ Revenge was n’t the only thing I wanted anymore . For the first time I felt like I ’d come alive watching you . But you were so young , so I told myself I ’d stay away . I found out who you were , and then I wanted to make sure you ’d get into a good school . Then I wanted to learn more and more about you . The more I found out , the deeper I kept falling into you . It was one thing after another . I kept sliding down this hill . I could n’t stop thinking about you . Every time I ’d go to a dark place , I ’d think of you and it always pulled me back . That ’s when I knew I could n’t let you go , because you were the only thing that really shone light in my life . You were a part of me that was n’t fueled by revenge , so I told myself it was okay . That I ’d be good for you . That I would n’t be like my father . I ’d give you everything and build a perfect life for you . That I would be the one for you when the time was right . That I ’d never make you cry . ”
89914	89923	89924	89924	I	0	“ You paid someone to be my friend , ”
89928	90020	89924	89924	I	0	“ I ’m not saying what I did was n’t a little much , but I was going insane worrying about you . Without knowing someone was watching you , I do n’t think I could have stayed away from you for as long as I did . I would have cracked , I know it . Paige kept me sane . At least then I knew you were okay . She was making sure nothing could hurt you at a time when I was n’t there to do it myself . ”
90021	90030	90031	90031	I	0	“ No one is trying to hurt me , ”
90045	90048	90049	90049	He	1704	“ Mallory . ”
90078	90127	90063	90063	I	0	“ I know I ’m a little crazy when it comes to you . Trust me . I know I ’m not great with reason , but I ca n’t control it . I ’ve tried . I ’ve fucking tried , but it is what it is . ”
90128	90137	90138	90138	I	0	“ What if I do n’t like it ? ”
90158	90187	90145	90145	His	1704	“ I think you do n’t want to like it , but a part deep inside of you does , or you would n’t be here right now . ”
90271	90312	90269	90269	Paige	104	“ I like parts of it , but , Oz , you ca n’t control everything . I have to have a little of my own life . Like my job . You ’ll stay out of that , right ? ”
90328	90342	90321	90321	I	0	“ I know I ’ve gotten where I am today because of you . ”
90343	90349	90350	90350	he	1704	“ That ’s not true , ”
90353	90380	90350	90350	he	1704	“ You ’re incredibly smart and would have gotten into any school in the country . I wanted to make sure your path led to me . ”
90434	90454	90455	90455	I	0	“ That said , you ’re still going to let me do my job and stay out of it , ”
90464	90530	90455	90455	I	0	“ I have to have a guard on you , sweetheart . When word gets out we ’re together , that puts a target on your back , and not just for my father , who knows I ’m after him . I ’m worth a lot of money , and if people know I have a weak spot , they ’ll go after it . ”
90531	90538	90539	90539	I	0	“ I ’m your weak spot ? ”
90554	90560	90561	90561	he	1709	“ You ’re my everything , ”
90569	90587	90561	90561	he	1709	“ It ’s hard to be mad at you when you say the sweetest stuff to me . ”
90588	90609	90561	90561	he	1709	“ It ’s better to give in , baby . I wo n’t stop coming for you until you do . ”
90610	90620	90621	90621	I	0	“ Promise you wo n’t interfere with my job , ”
90629	90637	90621	90621	I	0	“ I promise to try my best . ”
90638	90641	90642	90642	I	0	“ Miles ! ”
90648	90664	90645	90645	He	1709	“ I ’ll stay out of your way , but if someone fucks with you . ”

90777	90780	90781	90781	he	1709	“ Good , ”
90798	90816	90817	90817	He	1709	“ I can work on you not being mad at me for the rest of the weekend . ”

91000	91003	91004	91004	She	104	“ What ? ”
91055	91062	91041	91041	He	70	“ You have lip gloss on . ”

91166	91183	91184	91184	She	104	“ I was told you agreed to have security on you , since you and Oz ... ”
91210	91229	91204	91204	her	104	“ I did . I did . It seems weird , but I ’d rather it be you . ”
91238	91241	91242	91242	I	0	“ Lunch ? ”
91253	91279	91242	91242	I	0	“ I ’ll text you , but I should be good for lunch unless something comes up . Either way , the cafeteria , right ? ”
91280	91287	91288	91288	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s fine , ”
91299	91316	91288	91288	I	0	“ I told Oz I would n’t leave the building without letting you or him know . ”

93265	93284	93261	93261	her	113	“ That ’s really a big deal , and also really cool that he ’s asking you to . ”
93303	93322	93326	93326	she	113	“ I think if he ’s good enough for you , then you should give it your all . ”

94152	94159	94144	94144	she	1775	“ Thank you , Mrs. Osbourne . ”
94160	94163	94164	94164	she	1775	“ Vivien , ”
94177	94181	94164	94164	she	1775	“ Or Mom . ”
94208	94212	94213	94213	Oz	70	“ Shall we ? ”
94319	94322	94323	94323	Vivien	128	“ Mallory , ”
94326	94353	94323	94323	Vivien	128	“ I know everything there is to know about you , except why in God ’s good name you ’d choose to stay with my son . ”
94381	94385	94386	94386	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
94422	94504	94414	94414	she	128	“ He built this three years ago . At the time , I knew about you , but I did n’t realize his obsession . Then as time went on , I began to understand , and I tried to get more and more out of him about you . Could see what you meant to him . It started to change him . I had hoped that one day you would see this place and fall in love with it . ”
94517	94601	94602	94602	She	128	“ I think any mother would worry about her son if they were given this situation , but I knew a long time ago that Miles was different . When he made his mind up about something that was that . There was never any changing it . And I knew the day he told me about you , that you were it for him . I hoped that when you knew the truth that you would stay . And here you are . ”
94610	94620	94602	94602	She	128	“ So I guess I want to know why . ”
94621	94628	94629	94629	I	0	“ It ’s a fair question . ”
94639	94650	94629	94629	I	0	“ I think anyone who would look at Oz ’s — ”

94667	94671	94672	94672	Miles	130	“ A nickname , ”
94679	94682	94676	94676	I	0	“ Yes . ”
94692	94755	94683	94683	I	0	“ I think , on paper , what he ’s done without my knowledge could be seen as strange , but when I met him and began to see what I meant to him , how could I turn him away ? So many women go their entire lives without feeling a fraction of the attention and devotion Miles has shown me . ”
94768	94839	94840	94840	I	0	“ I ’m sure our relationship sounds crazy , and it may very well be . But to have a man so consumed with my happiness and with giving me the best in all aspects of my life , why would I not give in to him ? Sure , at first I was upset , because I felt deceived , but as I ’ve grown to care for Miles — ”
94849	94885	94886	94886	Oz	70	“ — as I ’ve grown to love him , I know that it came from the best and brightest part of his heart . He ’s given me something I ’ve never had before . ”
95163	95206	95157	95157	she	128	“ I met Paige a few years ago when Miles found her . She did n’t like me at first , and I understood why . The two of them share a father , but he was very different in their lives . ”
95220	95239	95207	95207	Vivien	128	“ Paige ’s story is not mine to tell . But I can tell you about Alexander Owens . ”
95279	95461	95255	95255	Vivien	128	“ I was eighteen when I met Alexander . I came from a middle - class Midwest home that was very religious . I was an only child and my parents were extremely strict with me . The only time I was allowed to go to social functions was when it involved the church . That summer our church had a weeklong festival fund - raiser , so I was expected to participate . I was in charge of selling pies , and before closing one night , he walked up . I was smitten with his good looks and charm right away . Alexander was the kind of man I ’d never seen before . Smart , wealthy , and said all the right things . He was older than me at twenty - five , and to an eighteen - year - old girl who ’d been sheltered most of her life , he looked like a movie star . He knew exactly what to say to my father to get him to agree to let him see me . “
95517	95530	95510	95510	she	2546	” Vivien has a faraway look in her eyes , but continues . “
95591	95604	95585	95585	I	0	” Vivien looks down at her hands and lets out a sigh . “
95848	95875	95845	95845	his	1797	” My heart breaks for her , knowing there are so many women who have gone through terrible things like her , and have no choice . “

96241	96248	96231	96231	he	161	” Oz says through gritted teeth . “

96332	96349	96316	96316	I	0	” I ask , looking between the two of them . Wondering what Oz had planned . “
96394	96410	96411	96411	I	0	” Vivien looks between us , and Oz walks over to sit down beside me . “
96475	96488	96489	96489	I	0	” I ca n’t help but think Paige was n’t that lucky . “
96668	96707	96661	96661	he	130	” I nod , because I understand all too well . He turns to me then , his eyes soft and warm . I squeeze his hand , letting him know I ’m here and I ’m real . “
96726	96736	96721	96721	he	161	” She breaks off and lets out a breath . “
96772	96818	96819	96821	Two beautiful women	1829	” I ca n’t imagine living through what she has , and possibly the guilt she carries . But looking into her soft eyes , and seeing her still able to smile shows her true strength . She looks to Oz and then to me . “
96836	96844	96845	96845	Paige	104	” Vivien says , looking at me . “
96893	96915	96886	96886	I	0	” Warmth spreads in my chest , thinking about having a mother in my life . What I ’ve always wanted . “
96930	96931	96932	96932	Mom	159	” “
96934	96953	96932	96932	Mom	159	” Miles warns , and Vivien laughs . She wiggles her eyebrows at me and points between us . “
96967	96985	96986	96986	Mallory	70	” The cloud of sadness passes , and all talk of Oz ’s father is pushed aside . “
97000	97074	96993	96993	I	0	” Oz says , standing up and holding out his hand for me . I take it and stand up , then we say our goodbyes to Vivien . She wraps me in a soft embrace , and I melt into her . I never knew how much I needed a hug like hers until I got it . She pulls back , squeezing my arms again and giving me a big smile . “
97081	97092	97079	97079	Mallory	70	” I nod happily , unable to hide my excitement . “
97103	97140	97141	97141	She	1833	” She gives me a wink as she turns to him , giving him a hug and shushing his protests . I walk out of the garden holding Oz ’s hand , feeling light and cheerful . “
97151	97163	97143	97145	an amazing woman	1834	” I say as Oz holds open the door for me . “
97174	97207	97208	97208	Oz	70	” We walk through the lobby and onto the elevator . Before I can push the button for the accounting floor , Oz takes my hand and hits the button for his . “
97218	97262	97208	97208	Oz	70	” I lean into him playfully , but the look on his face is serious . He runs his knuckles along my jaw and the look in his sapphire - blue eyes is so intense , I reach up and grab his wrist . “
97267	97268	97269	97269	My	0	” “
97288	97580	97286	97286	mine	1840	” The elevator dings , and the doors open revealing his secretary seated at her desk . She stands when she sees us , and they exchange a look , and she nods . It makes me anxious . He grips my hand a little tighter as we walk toward his office and to the double doors . I ’m hesitant , but then he moves his hand to the small of my back and opens the door in front of me . When I step inside I see a blonde woman facing away from us , and a big man in a suit next to her , his hand on her waist . She turns when she hears the door open and gives a soft smile . I ’m shocked when I recognize her as Ivy Lennox . My mind churns as she stands there , her hands twisting in front of her . She ’s wearing a cream summer dress with a matching cream blazer , the sleeves pushed up . Her peach - colored sandals look expensive , like the rest of her , and I remember thinking when I saw her in the picture in the article with Oz that she appeared wealthy . I do n’t know why that irritates me , but it does . But maybe it ’s her presence that ’s doing it . The large man beside her is in a dark suit , and he stands in such a way that ’s protective . And my annoyance turns to curiosity . Oz closes the doors behind us , and when I hear the click I snap back to reality . Turning to face him , I get right to the point . “
97586	97587	97588	97588	Mallory	70	” “
97610	97650	97651	97652	my Mallory	2542	” His hand presses against the small of my back again , and it comforts me , even if I ’m still confused . And I ’d be lying if I said I did n’t love the way he says “
97654	97787	97651	97652	my Mallory	2542	” But more questions are filling my head . This is the one woman I ’ve ever seen him photographed with , and he ’s never mentioned her . Oz leads us forward , and Ivy holds her hand out to shake mine . I automatically take it and feel how soft and delicate it is . A little insecurity runs through me , but Oz ’s large palm moves up and down my back as if petting me and reassuring me that everything is going to be okay . Brian does n’t move to shake my hand , though he greets Oz with a stern nod . He steps possessively next to Ivy and I ca n’t help but think he ’s probably feeling the same way I am right now . “
97797	97807	97651	97652	my Mallory	2542	” Her voice is as delicate as her touch . “
97824	97935	97936	97936	I	0	” Oz indicates the small couch and chairs over to the side , and we all walk over . Ivy sits on the chair , Brian silently moving next to her . Oz and I sit on the couch opposite them , and he scoots close to me . He takes my hands in his , gently squeezing them and letting me feel his strength . It ’s like he knows what I need in this moment and is n’t hesitating to give it to me . I see Brian rest his hand on the top of Ivy ’s crossed legs , while he stares at us , not speaking . “
97995	98021	98022	98022	My	0	” I glance from Oz to Ivy , and she tucks a lock of blond hair behind her ear nervously and picks up the story . “
98086	98099	98100	98100	We	1853	” She puts her hand on top of Brian ’s and continues . “
98160	98177	98178	98178	Miles	130	” She lets out an exhausted laugh , one that indicates she still does n’t understand . “
98226	98240	98211	98211	I	0	” Oz nods , agreeing with Ivy , and he continues the story . “
98394	98411	98412	98412	I	0	” He shakes his head as if he ’s remembering something he does n’t want to . “
98462	98474	98454	98454	I	0	” Ivy smiles softly , picking up where Oz left off . “
98531	98550	98526	98526	Brian	164	” She turns to him and smiles so sweetly , you can see the love in her eyes . “
98621	98635	98606	98606	I	0	” Ivy shrugs like it was no big deal what happened to her . “
98748	98771	98739	98739	he	164	” He leans over , nuzzling her neck and giving her a kiss on the cheek . She smiles at Oz and I. “
98828	98840	98821	98821	his	164	” She glances over to him and then back to us . “
98944	99038	99039	99039	I	0	” I examine Oz , who has his brow furrowed and a concerned thought in his eyes . Seeing our joined hands , I think about what it would mean if he continued to seek his own revenge . Would it always be a cloud between us ? Would only the death of his father fix everything ? Somehow I do n’t think the answer is yes . And Oz does n’t want him dead , he wants him ruined . Eventually will that be enough ? Will this be a constant worry ? “
99092	99108	99087	99087	she	1876	” He turns to me and brushes a loose strand of hair from my eyes . “
99153	99168	99137	99137	I	0	” We sit for a moment in silence before a deep voice breaks it . “
99181	99223	99137	99137	I	0	” With Brian ’s words , we all stand , and he and Ivy make their way out of the office . After the double doors close , Oz comes over to me and we sit down on the couch again . “
99230	99312	99137	99137	I	0	” His eyes that have held a part of my soul for so long , give me a sense of being more connected to him . To know that all of this has been to protect me , makes my love for him even deeper than before . Oz does n’t do anything lightly , and to know that he calculated all of this so that none of his darkness touched me , could only make me cling to him more . “
99321	99322	99315	99315	I	0	” “
99366	99393	99394	99394	I	0	” He grabs my face with both hands , and the intense , almost - dark shadow in his eyes shows me all of his emotions . “
99415	99517	99401	99401	I	0	” His words are hard and final , and I know there ’s no stopping his plan that ’s in place . I can only hope that at the end of this , we both come out safe . He kisses me so passionately and so thoroughly that there is no room for argument . I belong to him now , and as much as I should be fighting it , I wo n’t . I ’m his , and he ’s mine . I would do whatever it took to protect our love , and our possible family in the making .
99575	99596	99564	99564	Oz	70	“ I do n’t know what you ’re up to , Oz , but I ’m going to be late . ”
99666	99669	99670	99670	I	0	“ Oz ? ”
99681	99692	99670	99670	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? What did you do ? ”
99737	99744	99745	99745	she	1888	“ Mr. Osbourne , Ms. Sullivan , ”
99756	99767	99745	99745	she	1888	“ The offices have been moved and are in place . ”
99768	99774	99775	99776	The admin	1889	“ Thanks , Mrs. Rose . ”
99811	99819	99820	99820	I	0	“ Oz , where are we going ? ”
99935	99939	99940	99940	I	0	“ What the ... ”
99951	99970	99971	99971	she	113	“ I like the view a lot better up here , so do n’t get all sassy yet , ”
100000	100013	100014	100014	I	0	“ Perhaps you can give us a moment of privacy , Skyler ? ”
100024	100043	100014	100014	I	0	“ Sure , I ’ll go grab a Diet Coke from the cold Keurig in the break room . ”
100059	100072	100053	100053	she	113	“ Cold Keurig , Mallory . Do n’t ruin this for me . ”
100097	100119	100084	100084	I	0	“ I actually need some help with a special project , and I talked to Linda about borrowing you and Skyler . ”
100120	100213	100214	100214	I	0	“ And you did n’t stop to think about what I want ? Oz , I ’ve told you I need you to respect my space when it comes to my career . I know you ’re the one who gave me the scholarship , but I worked my ass off for my grades . I know what I earned , and I do n’t want that taken from me so you can give me some fluffed - up desk job so that I ’m closer to you . This is bullshit . ”
100297	100371	100372	100372	He	70	“ I understand how this might look , but I promise you , I ’ve got a plan and I need your help with it . I had the office up here converted months ago , but I ’ve been unable to hire the right person for the job . Then I saw the production rate that you and Skyler were working at and I think you ’d be perfect for this position . ”
100403	100419	100420	100420	I	0	“ Could n’t we have done this job from the floor we were already on ? ”
100431	100436	100420	100420	I	0	“ Actually , no . ”
100454	100513	100443	100443	he	70	“ The project will require you both to work with me and my admin closely . Whoever I hire for the position will have this office , no matter if it ’s you and Skyler or someone else . I think you both could do this project a lot of good . I want someone I can trust . ”
100610	100615	100616	100616	she	1902	“ Coffee , sir ? ”
100625	100630	100631	100631	he	70	“ No one in , ”
100657	100663	100664	100664	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
100740	100783	100784	100784	He	70	“ As was discussed at our private lunch yesterday , I found out that my inheritance came at a price . And though I ’ve made that money back a hundredfold , I do n’t like knowing that it began from something ... ”
100796	100799	100784	100784	He	70	“ Unsavory . ”
100846	100879	100880	100880	My	0	“ For a long time I sought revenge , and though a part of me still hates him , I think my energy is better spent taking care of those I love . ”
100908	100992	100887	100887	his	70	“ I ’ve decided to invest a large portion of my money in philanthropic projects . I need two people I can trust to sort out who ’s in need of money and where it should go . I ’ve seen what you and Skyler can do with numbers , and I trust you with everything I have , Mallory . I ’d like for you to head this project and help me do some good with everything that I ’ve been given . ”
100993	101004	101005	101005	My	0	“ You want us to run your company ’s charities ? ”
101012	101069	101005	101005	My	0	“ Yes . I think between you and Skyler , you could do a lot of good and make sure the money goes to all the right places . I want to really make a difference in children ’s lives . Ones who maybe do n’t have a support system to help them along the way . ”
101070	101074	101075	101075	I	0	“ Like me , ”
101083	101087	101088	101088	he	1907	“ Like you , ”
101091	101149	101088	101088	he	1907	“ I hate my father , but I wonder if I would ’ve found you without him . And that ’s something I ca n’t hate him for . So instead of investing all my energy in revenge , I want to invest some of it in something good . Giving back what was given to me . ”
101192	101195	101176	101176	his	1907	“ Oz . ”
101214	101231	101202	101202	he	1907	“ You have to talk to me . Not run me over with what you want . ”
101232	101236	101237	101237	he	1907	“ I know , ”
101253	101293	101237	101237	he	1907	“ I ’m trying . I want what ’s best for you , and I ’d be lying if that also did n’t include you being as close to me as possible . But I promise I ’m trying . ”
101309	101323	101302	101302	he	1907	“ I could have moved your apartment stuff like I did the office . ”
101341	101348	101329	101329	I	0	“ See ? I ’m trying . ”
101526	101532	101533	101533	I	0	“ I ’m being serious , ”
101543	101571	101533	101533	I	0	“ I am , too , sweetheart . I ’ll work better with you close . The security on this floor is the best in the building . ”
101606	101612	101614	101614	his	1907	“ I need you close . ”
101634	101653	101614	101614	his	1907	“ When I know you ’re near , I can breathe better . As crazy as that sounds . ”
101777	101790	101791	101791	he	1907	“ Fuck , I get so hard when I make you mine , ”
101800	101826	101791	101791	he	1907	“ When I know you ’re sinking into me a little more . Day by day . Bit by bit . Letting me have you . ”
101872	101910	101911	101911	he	1907	“ I ca n’t seem to get enough of you . Get close enough . I keep thinking if I have more , some of this obsession will cool . But I think it ’s only growing , ”
101932	101958	101911	101911	he	1907	“ You like it , do n’t you ? Knowing how fucking crazy I am for you . That I ca n’t breathe without you . ”
101959	101962	101963	101963	I	0	“ Yes , ”
101987	101992	101993	101993	He	1907	“ I love you . ”

102097	102102	102092	102092	He	70	“ Say it again . ”
102103	102108	102092	102092	He	70	“ I love you . ”
102145	102148	102140	102140	he	70	“ Oz . ”
102294	102311	102312	102312	He	70	“ You keep looking at me like that and you ’re never getting out of here . ”
102425	102437	102420	102420	he	70	“ Go , or we ’ll be back on the couch . ”
102484	102492	102493	102493	she	113	“ I ’ve got so many ideas ! ”
102687	102692	102693	102693	she	113	“ People are whispering , ”
102702	102721	102693	102693	she	113	“ I think it ’s better we ’re up here , even without the kick - ass project . ”
102749	102755	102756	102756	I	0	“ How bad is it ? ”
102764	102777	102778	102778	she	113	“ The gossip ’s not really about you . More about Miles , ”
102785	102800	102778	102778	she	113	“ Guess the word is Mr. Osbourne does n’t date . Like , ever . ”
102848	102863	102864	102864	She	113	“ And how he is with you . Or what people have caught anyway . ”

102984	103013	103014	103014	She	113	“ Yeah , he seems more caveman to me , but I ’ve also seen him punch a guy over you , so my view may be skewed . ”
103020	103027	103028	103028	She	113	“ An awesome caveman , though . ”
103047	103053	103039	103039	She	113	“ What do you have ? ”
103063	103085	103086	103086	She	113	“ I ’m thinking bigger than donations and events . With the budget we ’ve got , we can afford to . ”
103095	103105	103086	103086	She	113	“ We can make a big difference , Mallory . ”
103112	103123	103106	103106	I	0	“ Now I see why the White House wanted you . ”

103224	103263	103207	103207	He	70	“ Sadly , not this time . We ’ve got an event tomorrow , and I know you wo n’t have time to shop , so I ’m having some dresses brought up for you to look at . ”

103293	103306	103307	103307	He	70	“ I know when you say my real name you ’re angry . ”
103323	103339	103340	103340	He	70	“ Besides , you promised me you ’d go . So I ’m being helpful . ”

110308	110355	110356	110356	He	70	“ Not the kind of mark I was talking about . I meant between your legs . I think I would have felt a hell of a lot better about you in this dress if I knew that right now you had me coating your thighs . ”
110371	110376	110356	110356	He	70	“ And your pussy . ”

111845	111880	111842	111842	she	104	“ Then tonight he cornered me . Said I should be on desk duty if I was in fact pregnant . Then I went ahead and told him to mind his own fucking business . ”
111887	111895	111896	111896	She	104	“ And that led to a kiss ? ”
111901	111940	111898	111898	her	104	“ He started pushing , asking who the father was . He was pissed , Mal . Like , seriously pissed . Then he said there could n’t be anyone , and I asked him how he knew . ”

113090	113094	113095	113095	He	70	“ Fuck yes . ”
113308	113316	113317	113318	the man	628	“ Look at our little family reunion , ”
113345	113356	113357	113357	Oz	70	“ I was wondering if I ’d see you tonight . ”
113365	113373	113357	113357	Oz	70	“ Not even going to introduce me ? ”
113438	113463	113464	113464	Alexander	161	“ I assume you received the paperwork today . How does it feel to have everything bought out from under you and taken apart ? ”
113479	113503	113464	113464	Alexander	161	“ I warned you , Miles , do n’t fuck with me . I ’ll make sure this one does n’t wake up . ”
113588	113607	113608	113608	Alexander	161	“ You threaten what ’s mine , and I ’ll fucking end you . Do you hear me ? ”
113623	113682	113683	113683	Oz	70	“ We ’re done . I ’ve taken all your businesses and put them under . I ’ve got piles of dirt on you a mile high , and if you so much as step foot in my town again , I ’ll do more than fuck with your money . Do . You . Understand . Me . ”
113730	113737	113738	113738	I	0	“ I want to go home , ”

114017	114043	114044	114044	He	70	“ I ’ve been after revenge for my mother all these years , and she does n’t even seem to give the man two thoughts . ”
114051	114083	114044	114044	He	70	“ But I knew when you came into my life that it needed to end . I could n’t live a life where I was worried about you around every corner . ”
114084	114121	114122	114122	I	0	“ I ’m not scared of him , if that ’s what you ’re thinking . I ’ll keep my security and do as you guys ask if you ’re worried about him coming after me , ”
114125	114136	114137	114137	he	70	“ You do n’t want me to let it go ? ”
114149	114177	114137	114137	he	70	“ I want you to do whatever it is you think you should do , but I do n’t think Paige is going to let it go . ”
114197	114208	114209	114209	he	70	“ I would n’t stand in the way of Paige , ”
114253	114270	114271	114271	he	70	“ Did it scare you when I grabbed him in there ? Threatened to kill him ? ”
114284	114317	114281	114281	his	70	“ I ’ve never been scared of you , Oz . You were protecting the people you love . That does n’t scare me . It ’s another reason I love you . ”
114318	114340	114369	114369	his	2121	“ I told myself I ’d never be like him but I ca n’t help but compare some of our similarities . ”
114341	114358	114369	114369	his	2121	“ Oz , you are nothing like that man ! How can you even think that ? ”
114359	114365	114366	114366	he	2121	“ How can you not ? ”
114379	114408	114374	114374	I	0	“ You ’d never hurt me . Ever . Think about it , Oz . Everything you have ever done when it came to us is for me . ”
114409	114419	114420	114420	He	2121	“ Is it ? Or is it for me ? ”
114436	114541	114420	114420	He	2121	“ I stalked you when I knew I wanted you , did everything to make sure I could have you . I mapped out your whole life to lead to me , so that you would need me . I ’ve even been trying to get you pregnant . Each time I took you that thought flooded my mind . That if we had a baby you could never leave me . We ’d have something that linked us together forever . The worst part is knowing that I ’ll never let you go . Ca n’t you see how selfish I ’ve been ? ”
114555	114564	114565	114565	He	2122	“ Oz , am I like your father ? ”
114576	114606	114572	114572	I	0	“ Because I would never let you go either , and if anyone ever threatened you or tried to take you from me I ’d kill them , too . ”
114688	114697	114698	114698	I	0	“ I love when you take me bare . ”
114759	114775	114754	114754	He	2122	“ I think I should make love to you for the rest of the night . ”
114782	114797	114798	114798	He	2122	“ I do n’t know if this dress is going to make it home . ”

116138	116194	116133	116133	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . I ’ve done this in my head a thousand times . Everywhere we go , I look for the right spot , and every time I hold you , I try to find the right words , but I ca n’t seem to make it sound perfect in my head . ”
116195	116198	116206	116206	her	2158	“ Oz , ”
116209	116215	116199	116199	she	2158	“ What are you doing ? ”
116233	116298	116299	116299	I	0	“ Mallory , I ’ve loved you from the very second I saw you . The very second . There was no hesitation from my heart that day , and I knew I had to make you mine . I may have gone about it differently than some men would have , but I would n’t change anything since it led me to you . ”
116314	116339	116299	116299	I	0	“ I realize that this is soon for you , but it ’s been years for me . Years in the making , baby . ”
116374	116408	116409	116409	I	0	“ I ’ve waited for you to see me , for you to love me and for you to marry me . Please , baby . Do n’t make me wait another day . ”
116451	116561	116566	116566	her	2159	“ When you saw this last night , I was so relieved you loved it . I found out about it from an antiques dealer and got in touch with the estate . They agreed to sell it to me after I told them about you . And that I planned to put it up at an auction at a price I knew no one could touch . This way , the foundation would benefit from the love I have for you , and this ring would find a new home on your hand . I want it to carry our love story for the next one hundred years . ”
116580	116590	116591	116591	She	2159	“ Mallory Ann Sullivan , will you marry me ? ”
116695	116702	116703	116703	she	2159	“ I love you so much , ”
116717	116736	116703	116703	she	2159	“ Yes , I ’ll marry you . Even though you ’re crazy obsessed and a borderline stalker . ”
116737	116748	116703	116703	she	2159	“ Do n’t act like you do n’t like it . ”
116825	116837	116808	116808	I	0	“ And when were you planning on telling me about this ? ”
116855	116861	116848	116848	she	175	“ Just a false alarm . ”
116881	116892	116879	116879	her	175	“ Baby , how is being pregnant a false alarm ? ”
116921	116924	116925	116925	she	175	“ What ? ”
116947	116959	116960	116960	She	175	“ How is this possible ? There was only one yesterday . ”
116985	116995	116960	116960	She	175	“ It ’s two lines . It says pregnant . ”
116996	117019	117020	117020	She	175	“ I must not have waited long enough . Oh my God . Oz , we ’re going to have a baby . ”
117031	117040	117024	117024	she	175	“ We ’re going to have a baby . ”
117080	117109	117071	117071	She	175	“ Sorry , you proposed to me , and I found out I ’m pregnant all in the same moment . It ’s kind of an emotional overload . ”
117110	117118	117119	117119	I	0	“ For me , too , baby . ”
117367	117383	117409	117409	she	175	“ I love you , Mallory . I will love you until my last breath . ”
117384	117398	117409	117409	she	175	“ I love you , too , my beautiful man behind the curtain . ”
117470	117477	117478	117478	She	175	“ I ’m going to come . ”
117748	117755	117756	117756	she	175	“ See ? I ’m fine , ”
117828	117837	117838	117838	I	0	“ I do n’t want to hurt you . ”
117993	118005	118006	118006	She	175	“ Oz , trust me , this is n’t hurting anything . ”
118061	118078	118079	118079	Her	175	“ Baby , I would have eaten you all morning if that ’s what you wanted . ”
118089	118109	118084	118084	she	175	“ I love you , Oz , but I ’m over your mouth . I want you inside me . ”

118596	118605	118590	118590	she	175	“ They ’re already set to be delivered . ”
118617	118622	118606	118606	I	0	“ In thirty minutes . ”
118623	118632	118633	118633	she	175	“ God , you ’re good at this , ”
118661	118666	118669	118669	her	175	“ Oh , shit , ”
118693	118697	118690	118690	her	175	“ It worked ! ”

118899	118911	118913	118913	him	130	“ Okay , buddy . But this is the last one . ”
118933	118955	118916	118916	I	0	“ Once upon a time , there was a very beautiful princess . The most beautiful princess in all the land . ”
118956	118959	118960	118960	Henry	130	“ Mommy ? ”
118969	118990	118960	118960	Henry	130	“ Of course . So the beautiful princess did n’t know , but a very handsome prince was watching her . ”

119014	119053	119003	119003	I	0	“ So , this ruggedly handsome prince was protecting the princess from all the dark things around her . He kept his distance while she grew up , and then one day , she wandered onto his land . ”
119069	119118	119062	119062	he	130	“ After many years of watching the princess from a distance , finally she was within reach . So the prince knew it was time to reveal himself . But once the princess found out about all he ’d done behind her back , she was very angry . ”
119119	119123	119124	119124	Henry	130	“ What happened ? ”
119138	119175	119176	119176	I	0	“ Like any good prince , he fought the dragons and witches and climbed the biggest tower in all the kingdoms to rescue the princess and make her see that he did it all for love . ”
119218	119237	119238	119238	Mallory	70	“ Lucky for the prince , he was so good - looking , the princess could n’t resist . ”

120934	120954	120955	120955	he	70	“ If you ’d quit putting these damn things on , I would n’t have to keep removing them , ”
120965	120979	120955	120955	he	70	“ Do n’t act like unwrapping your present is n’t half the fun . ”
121072	121087	121088	121088	Oz	70	“ Fuck , I ’ll never get enough of hearing you scream my name , ”
