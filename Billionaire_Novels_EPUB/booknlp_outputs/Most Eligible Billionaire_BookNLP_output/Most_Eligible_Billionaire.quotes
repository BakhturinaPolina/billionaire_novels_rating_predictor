12269	12304	12305	12305	Henry	102	“ Look , when she asked me to care for Smuckers , she told me she ’d defray the costs of his special salon and vet . So if she left something for that … ”
12311	12328	12305	12305	Henry	102	“ I ’d imagine control of a multibillion - dollar conglomerate would defray a few costs . ”

12573	12598	12569	12570	the lawyer	680	“ Yes , then it ’s no different than awarding control to an infant with a guardian acting in that infant ’s best interests . ”

Kaleb and Henry have been excellent stewards of Locke Worldwide . Under their guidance , the firm has expanded enormously and created a massive amount of wealth . While we ’re working all of this out , I 'm going to suggest that Smuckers might see his way clear to allow Kaleb to retain his proxy while Henry continues on as operational CEO . You ’ll stay on , Kaleb ? ”

15907	15988	15989	15989	Malcomb	134	“ It means , if Smuckers wants to , he would take his place on the board with your assistance . He would attend meetings and vote on things , and his vote would decide issues , mostly around the overall direction of the company . As CEO , Henry runs the day - to - day stuff . But as a board member and owner , Smuckers would provide the vision and direction , while drawing a monthly stipend . ”

24919	24931	24932	24932	she	100	“ You know what Smuckers hates even more than being fooled ? ”
24958	24964	24965	24965	she	100	“ He hates being threatened , ”
24968	24979	24965	24965	she	100	“ And bullied . He really , really hates it . ”

24999	25044	24996	24996	myself	0	“ He ’s used to bubbles and bows and sunny parks but he ’s in the jungle now . There are animals here who are faster and stronger and smarter than he is . Animals who will dominate him easily . Savagely , even . ”
25045	25055	24965	24965	she	100	“ Then you do n’t know Smuckers very well . ”

30831	30872	30825	30825	I	0	“ People have tried to push Smuckers around . Take things away from him . Smuckers wears bow ties , and he ’s cute and fluffy , but he is so done with people pushing him around . So done . ”
30880	30898	30873	30873	Everyone	376	“ Cuff bracelet . All metal is a pink alloy . This is what you wear when … ”
30912	30941	30899	30899	I	0	“ Well , it ’s what you wear whenever you feel like it . It ’s high - end , but not playing the high - end game . ”
30990	31026	31028	31028	I	0	“ It ’s not about what the world tells you to be . It ’s about what makes you feel alive . This is for a woman who ’s so done with being pushed around . ”
31054	31079	31080	31080	I	0	“ I like it , but it does n’t work for us , and especially not … it ’s not what we had slotted . ”

32261	32316	32258	32258	she	100	“ Smuckers needs a place to sit , too . I mean , does it seem fair to you that every board member here has their own seat except Smuckers ? Who ever heard of an individual who sits on the board of a major corporation having to sit on another person ’s lap ? ”
32335	32340	32341	32341	I	0	“ A bit redundant , ”

33127	33130	33131	33131	I	0	“ What ? ”
33134	33155	33156	33156	I	0	“ Smuckers does n’t like the idea of new software . The learning curve — he ’s not into it . ”
33159	33179	33180	33180	She	100	“ If we wanted to stay away from learning curves we ’d still be adding and subtracting on abacuses . ”
33183	33203	33180	33180	She	100	“ You ’re preaching to the choir , dude . I ’m not the one to be convinced here . ”
33215	33223	33224	33224	I	0	“ Smuckers can hear me just fine , ”
33253	33277	33250	33250	Vicky	100	“ Smuckers does n’t like how you ’re talking to me when he ’s the one making the decisions . He feels alienated . ”

33286	33296	33297	33297	she	100	“ You should make your arguments directly to Smuckers , ”
33300	33316	33297	33297	she	100	“ If you want him on your side you need to work a little harder . ”
33317	33328	33329	33329	She	100	“ We ’re not going to do that , Vicky . ”
33337	33353	33329	33329	She	100	“ Smuckers is n’t feeling favorable to the funding , that ’s the problem here . ”

33364	33375	33376	33376	She	100	“ We could lose millions of dollars of business here . ”
33379	33458	33376	33376	She	100	“ Then I ’d suggest you tell Smuckers directly why he should cast a yes vote . Really talk to him . Make him feel included . Because , between you all and me and the Locke Worldwide flagpoles , you ’re not treating him with the respect he feels is his due . You tried to defraud him in the last meeting , and now you ’re ignoring him . Can you blame him for being unhappy ? ”
33582	33589	33590	33590	Mandy	150	“ Dreoger starts on the fifteenth , ”

33736	33771	33733	33733	I	0	“ if we were to convert over to this new software , it ’ll result in a tighter integration of our core services . And honestly , nobody is worried about the learning curve . ”

33786	33793	33794	33794	she	100	“ That ’s not very persuasive , ”
33797	33802	33803	33803	I	0	“ Look , Smuckers , ”
33811	33879	33803	33803	I	0	“ We really need your vote on this . I know what you ’re thinking , that a services integration will result in higher initial bid costs , so yeah , our bids might not look competitive , but this up - front integration will cut out surprises . Construction and design would work together , instead of a design being handed over to construction to interpret . ”
33886	33896	33897	33897	I	0	“ Can you imagine how much time that wastes ? ”
34031	34065	34066	34066	I	0	“ When everyone collaborates at the front , Smuckers , projects run shorter , with fewer surprises . That ’s more valuable than lower up - front costs , do n’t you agree ? ”
34110	34121	34107	34107	I	0	“ The tighter integration of business units will be incredible . ”
34129	34135	34136	34136	I	0	“ Is that a yes ? ”

34366	34374	34375	34375	I	0	“ What ’s that ? Okay then . ”
34378	34405	34375	34375	I	0	“ While Smuckers appreciates your effort , Mr. Locke , you really just did n’t do it for him in the end . Smuckers votes no . ”

34526	34534	34535	34535	Mandy	150	“ Can you articulate an actual reason ? ”
34543	34551	34535	34535	Mandy	150	“ Other than your being a jerk ? ”
34552	34559	34560	34560	Henry	127	“ Let ’s dial it back , ”
34904	34909	34910	34910	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
34913	34960	34961	34961	Mandy	150	“ I can see why you ’d be mad after being bullied and tricked . Or being threatened if you do n’t take a payout . Or being unfairly brought to the police station … oh wait — that ’s what you guys did to me . ”
34964	34974	34961	34961	Mandy	150	“ This is impossible . This is not okay . ”
34981	34992	34975	34975	Henry	127	“ It ’s a business problem with a business solution . ”
35048	35055	35056	35056	he	127	“ We ’ll revisit this thing , ”

35143	35190	35140	35140	he	127	“ I ca n’t remember the last time we gave to an animal charity . With Smuckers on the board now , I think it might be a nice gesture for the foundation to fund up a needy local rescue or shelter . A substantial gift . ”
35211	35215	35216	35216	Brett	127	“ Love it , ”
35219	35239	35216	35216	Brett	127	“ People are going to hear about Smuckers soon enough . Let ’s make it a fun news story . ”
35240	35243	35244	35244	Henry	127	“ Right ? ”
35249	35269	35244	35244	Henry	127	“ You would n’t be opposed to that , would you ? Or , I ’m sorry , Smuckers ? ”
35270	35279	35280	35280	I	0	“ That ’s the last thing I expected , ”
35282	35290	35291	35291	Henry	127	“ Do you want to spearhead it ? ”
35294	35297	35291	35291	Henry	127	“ Me ? ”
35304	35310	35298	35298	I	0	“ Is this a trick ? ”
35311	35334	35244	35244	Henry	127	“ Does asking for your help to identify a charity to give a million dollars to seem like a trick to you ? ”
35335	35340	35298	35298	I	0	“ A million dollars ? ”
35341	35380	35298	35298	I	0	“ For our portion . Partners might want to contribute if there ’s enough buzz . We can have a ceremony and introduce Smuckers . Have fun with it . Turn what my mother did into something positive . ”

35421	35449	35298	35298	I	0	“ And you can direct it to a specific organization . You know , if you have opinions . Or we can have a consultant handle it — ”
35450	35489	35298	35298	I	0	“ No , I have opinions . There ’s this dog and cat rescue shelter my friend runs — they’re really good . They just started a stray drop - off center and they could do so much . ”

35511	35536	35506	35506	He	127	“ Get the details and coordinate our calendars on the ceremony . Make a list of who to reach out to and all that . ”
35553	35558	35548	35548	he	127	“ Good with you ? ”

35644	35673	35641	35641	Henry	127	“ We ’ll want to keep it under wraps until we orchestrate the PR angle , but we can float the donation as soon as they need it . ”
35741	35744	35745	35745	he	127	“ What ? ”
35748	35773	35745	35745	he	127	“ It ’s just really nice . For the memory of your mother . For animals in need . For my friend ’s organization . ”
35780	35788	35789	35789	he	127	“ I want to make this work , ”

35820	35823	35809	35809	He	127	“ Truce ? ”
35904	35914	35915	35915	he	127	“ You know what we need to do now ? ”
35918	35921	35915	35915	he	127	“ What ? ”
35922	35931	35932	35932	he	127	“ Make one of those ridiculous giant checks , ”
35935	35954	35932	35932	he	127	“ That does n’t seem like the kind of thing that would be in a CEO job description . ”
35955	35977	35978	35978	He	127	“ It ’s in the CEO job description if the CEO says it is . I make the operational rules here . ”
36026	36029	36012	36012	Smuckers	101	“ Hey … ”
36035	36043	36044	36044	He	127	“ You ca n’t just take Smuckers . ”

36832	36854	36855	36855	I	0	“ You turned your face to him and your nostrils went in and out . That means you were smelling him . ”

36941	36951	36924	36924	He	127	“ Why would I be interested in smelling you ? ”
36952	36969	36970	36970	He	127	“ I can think of a lot of reasons you ’d be interested in smelling me . ”
36992	36996	36980	36980	He	127	“ Name one . ”
36997	37000	37001	37001	His	127	“ Hmm . ”

37031	37038	36980	36980	He	127	“ That ’s not a no . ”
37039	37051	37052	37052	He	127	“ Seriously ? Do you automatically assume every woman wants you ? ”
37058	37099	37052	37052	He	127	“ Seriously . You think everyone lives to scrape at your feet , scrambling for crumbs of your attention and approval ? Trying to smell you ? And if a girl is truly lucky , maybe you ’ll pick her ? ”
37109	37112	37113	37113	I	0	“ Well ? ”
37116	37138	37113	37113	I	0	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . Are you waiting for an answer ? I thought that was a rhetorical question . ”

37782	37786	37769	37769	I	0	“ Griffin Place . ”
37787	37790	37718	37718	Henry	102	“ What ? ”
37791	37799	37800	37800	I	0	“ Griffin Place , my fave building . ”
37813	37832	37800	37800	I	0	“ See ? My sister , Carly , and I … it ’s just one of our favorites . ”
37833	37840	37841	37841	he	102	“ Oh , the Reinhold building , ”
37844	37847	37848	37848	I	0	“ Right , ”
37851	37859	37848	37848	I	0	“ You probably know all the names . ”
37860	37874	37800	37800	I	0	“ Being a smirkitect , you know . It goes with the territory . ”
37875	37879	37880	37880	I	0	“ The Reinhold , ”
37904	37916	37917	37917	He	102	“ In all of Manhattan ? You like the Reinhold best ? ”
37921	37928	37917	37917	He	102	“ What ? It ’s great . ”
37929	37932	37933	37933	He	102	“ Hmm . ”
38027	38032	38012	38012	He	102	“ What about it ? ”
38047	38053	38054	38054	I	0	“ It ’s the griffin , ”
38058	38073	38054	38054	I	0	“ What is it about the griffin ? A lot of buildings have them . ”
38074	38080	38081	38081	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”

38136	38142	38143	38143	I	0	“ A moment in time , ”
38146	38170	38143	38143	I	0	“ When my sister and I first got here , we got lost . We took this bus and it was a disaster . ”
38187	38212	38171	38171	I	0	“ She was crying , and I pointed this griffin out and made up this stupid story about him being our brave protector friend . ”
38227	38235	38218	38218	I	0	“ Did he help ? The griffin ? ”
38236	38240	38241	38241	I	0	“ A lot , ”
38244	38280	38241	38241	I	0	“ She stopped crying and we took pictures of him . I printed one out and put it in the kitchen . If nothing else , he scared the cockroaches back down into the drain . ”
38281	38290	38218	38218	I	0	“ You came here after your parents died . ”
38291	38300	38301	38301	I	0	“ Somebody has been busy investigating my background , ”
38304	38315	38316	38316	I	0	“ Surely you ’re not surprised we investigated . Considering . ”
38609	38625	38626	38626	he	1397	“ We make doors and windows , refurbish heating plants , that sort of thing , ”
38632	38649	38626	38626	he	1397	“ Locke owns so much property , it stopped making sense to sub this stuff out . ”
38779	38791	38792	38792	He	102	“ I ’ll cut this down a little for the check . ”
38815	38843	38844	38844	He	102	“ I do n’t actually do this , typically , but I do n’t want to pull people off jobs that have been waiting in a queue . ”
38921	38932	38933	38933	He	102	“ Maybe we should get an armored car for this . ”

39003	39016	39017	39017	he	102	“ We have a few exciting projects you should be in on , ”
39055	39077	39050	39050	He	102	“ I thought architects only made these on TV . I mean , do n’t you have computers for this nowadays ? ”
39089	39140	39141	39141	He	102	“ Building is one of the most tactile things you can do . We ’re creating physical environments . Making them tiny first , holding them and situating them , it reveals new things about the buildings and the spatial relationships . You see what feels right on the ground . ”
39147	39152	39141	39141	He	102	“ Where is this ? ”
39153	39177	39178	39178	I	0	“ Nowhere yet . It ’s going to be along the Queens waterfront . The Ten — that ’s what we call it . ”
39188	39207	39178	39178	I	0	“ Dude , I hate to tell you , but Queens is all built up along the river . ”
39208	39239	39141	39141	He	102	“ There ’s a swath of factories there that are moving to a less expensive area . We ’ll knock them down and replace it with residential and green space . ”
39240	39245	39246	39246	He	1417	“ It looks nice . ”
39251	39260	39248	39248	his	1417	“ You do n’t think it looks nice ? ”
39264	39279	39248	39248	his	1417	“ It could be better , but it ’s good for what it is . ”
39280	39293	39141	39141	He	102	“ If it could be better , why not make it better ? ”
39294	39301	39302	39302	Smuckers	101	“ Too deep in the pipeline . ”
39511	39516	39486	39486	his	102	“ Right . Okay . ”
39692	39700	39675	39675	He	102	“ This ’ll just take a minute . ”
39701	39712	39675	39675	He	102	“ Do you need it for a presentation or something ? ”
39713	39723	39724	39724	he	102	“ No , it just needs to be fixed , ”
39852	39855	39849	39849	his	1445	“ just right ”
39916	39934	39935	39935	I	0	“ Are you sure this whole business is n’t a front for guys who are closet crafters ? ”
39953	39961	39962	39962	He	102	“ This ’ll just take a minute . ”
40112	40124	40109	40109	I	0	“ So , what ’s the deal ? Why the urgency ? ”
40125	40148	40149	40149	He	102	“ The guy who makes our environmental elements , these tiny trees ? He ’s from my grandfather ’s era … shit . ”
40155	40163	40149	40149	He	102	“ It ’s just a long story . ”
40193	40198	40199	40199	I	0	“ Quite the perfectionist , ”
40202	40207	40208	40208	he	102	“ Something like that , ”
40245	40256	40257	40257	I	0	“ An earthquake and a hurricane at the same time , ”
40260	40270	40257	40257	I	0	“ Not a lot of buildings will withstand that . ”
40279	40285	40286	40286	He	102	“ See those balsa dowels ? ”
40296	40302	40286	40286	He	102	“ Can you grab one ? ”
40411	40414	40401	40401	he	102	“ Crap . ”
40415	40424	40425	40425	I	0	“ You could pretend it ’s Spanish moss , ”
40433	40438	40428	40428	He	102	“ You need help ? ”
40439	40469	40401	40401	he	102	“ I got it . I used to do a lot of this as a boy . Brett and me both . We ’d spend hours doing these models . ”
40470	40477	40401	40401	he	102	“ When was the last time ? ”
40478	40490	40428	40428	He	102	“ I got this . It ’s like riding a bike . ”
40491	40499	40500	40500	I	0	“ Except you have large hands now , ”
40523	40554	40555	40555	I	0	“ It ’s too bad you do n’t have somebody with you who has way more recent experience gluing tiny things to tiny surfaces with her slim , womanly hands , ”
40558	40573	40555	40555	I	0	“ It ’s really a shame that there is n’t anybody like that here . ”
40583	40590	40591	40591	I	0	“ Dude . Let me help . ”
40598	40620	40591	40591	I	0	“ You think you ’re an expert because of your Etsy dog collar store ? This is a little more intricate . ”
40621	40634	40635	40635	I	0	“ I make jewelry of all kinds , not just dog stuff , ”
40639	40643	40644	40644	he	102	“ We know , ”
40647	40677	40644	40644	he	102	“ Come on . You make the trunks and shave the branch curlies and I ’ll do the gluing . And please , your technique ? With the toothpick ? ”
40683	40689	40678	40678	He	102	“ You think you can ? ”
40719	40725	40726	40726	He	102	“ I know I can . ”
40775	40783	40752	40752	I	0	“ Oh . That ’s more efficient . ”
40784	40790	40791	40791	I	0	“ Was that a compliment ? ”
40804	40813	40814	40814	I	0	“ Gluing stuff is my jam , baby . ”
41491	41498	41499	41499	she	100	“ That ’s a good one , ”
41687	41693	41672	41672	She	100	“ What do you think ? ”
41702	41709	41710	41710	I	0	“ Why did you leave Vermont ? ”
41713	41716	41710	41710	I	0	“ What ? ”
41717	41729	41672	41672	She	100	“ Two young girls . Their parents die . Why leave ? ”
41743	41748	41749	41749	She	100	“ Why not stay ? ”
41753	41765	41749	41749	She	100	“ Prescott ’s in the middle of nowhere . Very rural . ”
41766	41781	41782	41782	She	100	“ If I wanted to know that , I would ’ve looked on Google . ”
41846	41860	41841	41841	Her	100	“ Surely you knew people there . You came to a strange city . ”
41861	41869	41870	41870	She	100	“ I didn’t … like it there . ”
41880	41883	41870	41870	She	100	“ Why ? ”
41896	41944	41893	41893	she	100	“ This thing happened when I was in high school , and people hated me . Really hated me . Not normal hate but a certain incident got me a high level of hate all through that area . I did n’t do anything wrong , but … ”
41949	41962	41945	41945	She	100	“ It does n’t matter . It was one of those things . ”
42031	42039	42024	42024	she	100	“ It must have been … hard . ”
42040	42049	42050	42050	she	100	“ Alone and hated is a different country , ”
42087	42131	42078	42078	She	100	“ Being hated , it ’s like a burn . It keeps hurting long after . And little things that do n’t hurt other people sting like hell . Sometimes even sunshine hurts . I do n’t know why I ’m telling you . ”
42205	42213	42182	42182	She	100	“ Should we redo this light pole ? ”
42214	42217	42218	42218	I	0	“ Probably , ”
42241	42258	42234	42234	I	0	“ The long sticks are the hardest to cut . There ’s a trick to it . ”
42325	42328	42329	42329	she	100	“ What ? ”
42373	42378	42365	42365	We	1486	“ This looks good . ”
42402	42409	42396	42396	her	100	“ You ca n’t even tell . ”

42423	42440	42394	42394	She	100	“ Are you going to tell me why it ’s so important to have it right ? ”
42450	42453	42454	42454	I	0	“ Nope , ”
42458	42470	42454	42454	I	0	“ What ? You ’re just not going to tell me ? ”
42471	42474	42475	42475	I	0	“ Hmm … ”
42481	42484	42475	42475	I	0	“ Nope . ”
42489	42493	42494	42494	I	0	“ Just nope ? ”
42497	42509	42494	42494	I	0	“ Oh screw off . You think you ’re so funny . ”
42515	42553	42510	42510	She	100	“ Henry . All eyes upon Henry , prince of all he sees . He ’s New York ’s most eligible bastard ! He knows all your names and oh my god , he ’s soooo funny . ”
42554	42562	42563	42563	I	0	“ What did you just call me ? ”
42571	42576	42563	42563	I	0	“ You heard me . ”
42620	42649	42605	42605	her	100	“ You said it would look different if you got your way . If it was n’t so far into the pipeline . How would it be different ? ”
42665	42692	42659	42659	She	100	“ Have you ever noticed how a lot of new buildings create a dead zone around them ? Hunks of metal and stone that stop everything ? ”
42693	42703	42752	42752	her	100	“ Well , that ’s the point , right ? ”
42704	42710	42711	42711	I	0	“ It should n’t be , ”
42718	42746	42711	42711	I	0	“ I want buildings that are n’t a one - sided conversation . Buildings should never feel like walls . They should feel soft instead of hard . ”
42786	42802	42806	42806	she	100	“ I do n’t get it . How can you make a building like that ? ”
42856	42877	42878	42878	I	0	“ Look at how porous it is . It does n’t block anything , it does n’t impose its will . ”
42886	42894	42878	42878	I	0	“ See how it invites and engages ? ”
42904	42909	42895	42895	She	100	“ Like a dance . ”
42922	42979	42916	42916	My	0	“ Exactly . Something like this would create a sense of place that draws people . The Ten is good for what it is . Locke is going to deliver better than anyone else , but if I had total control I ’d do something vastly superior . Look at the way these structural elements invite … ”
43000	43009	42995	42995	She	100	“ Why design it in the inferior way ? ”
43010	43043	43046	43046	her	100	“ It ’s a Kaleb project , and he ’s protecting our profit . He has a minimum profit - per - square - foot dollar figure that … keeps things boring . ”
43070	43079	43080	43080	she	100	“ And you want to make something cool , ”
43083	43088	43080	43080	she	100	“ Screw the profit . ”
43089	43107	43108	43108	Her	100	“ Nah . I ’m not running a charity . We can make more money my way . ”
43114	43120	43108	43108	Her	100	“ Your vastly superior way . ”
43173	43177	43178	43178	My	0	“ Vastly superior . ”
43183	43191	43178	43178	My	0	“ Were I to have total control . ”

43818	43822	43823	43823	she	100	“ So superior , ”
43830	43836	43826	43826	Her	100	“ When given complete control . ”
44229	44233	44234	44234	I	0	“ So superior , ”

44362	44365	44366	44366	I	0	“ What ? ”
44369	44391	44366	44366	I	0	“ Just another business problem with a business solution . And the solution is your magic peen ? Is that it ? ”
44412	44446	44400	44400	I	0	“ You ’re not going to get your way by fooling me , and you ’re sure not going to get it like this . Smuckers and I are so out of here . ”

45112	45120	45109	45109	Brett	127	“ We ’ll normalize things after that . ”
45130	45148	45121	45121	They	1539	“ But Smuckers is in complete agreement with us as far as a project like this goes . ”

45181	45192	45193	45193	he	127	“ I ca n’t believe it ’s working this well , ”
45196	45215	45193	45193	he	127	“ The Smuckers thing . It ’s brilliant . As long as you can keep her under control . ”

45896	45924	45840	45840	I	0	“ No . Though bullying does n’t always get reported . Her background is a little sparse . Her internet footprint is small for somebody her age . ”

47438	47452	47458	47458	I	0	“ Yeah , I do . Which reveals the direction of your thoughts . ”
47453	47457	47458	47458	I	0	“ So arrogant , ”
47486	47517	47481	47481	I	0	“ I ’m not the one covering the city with massive phallic symbols emblazoned with my name . It ’s the direction of your thoughts we should be concerned about . ”
47518	47527	47528	47528	he	127	“ Like a Rorschach ink - blot test , ”

47682	47688	47677	47677	He	127	“ If the name fits … ”

48265	48274	48275	48275	He	127	“ You like my hands , I think . ”
48287	48303	48275	48275	He	127	“ You ’re going to like them even better when they ’re between your legs . ”

48945	48955	48942	48942	I	0	“ And then all bets are off , Vicky . ”

49010	49054	48980	48980	I	0	“ I do n’t think you do . The only time you ever pet Smuckers is … for a purpose . You want to make him paddle his legs or calm down or something . You never just pet him out of fun . ”
49055	49064	49001	49001	He	127	“ He ’s just a dog , Vicky . ”
49082	49091	49072	49072	I	0	“ You hardly ever even say his name . ”
49092	49099	49100	49100	He	127	“ Smuckers is just a dog . ”

49112	49122	48980	48980	I	0	“ A dog your mother left her company to . ”
49123	49188	49189	49189	I	0	“ You think I ’m jealous of a dog ? Please , Vicky . If I wanted to wear my hair in a marshmallow Afro and live in a woman ’s purse , I think I could find a way to arrange it . This is New York , after all . There is probably a dominatrix out there who ’d make it happen . ”
49194	49228	49189	49189	I	0	“ You know what I find weird ? People are n’t freaking out about Smuckers ’s control of the company very much . They all seem to think it ’s a PR stunt . ”
49229	49248	49189	49189	I	0	“ A lot of people see it as a PR stunt . Connected to his dog shelter gift . ”
49249	49258	49189	49189	I	0	“ And you ’re letting them think that . ”
49259	49263	49189	49189	I	0	“ We are . ”

49276	49284	49285	49285	He	1595	“ Unless … I do n’t know … ”
49288	49301	49285	49285	He	1595	“ Unless we have more evil plans to get rid of you ? ”
49354	49363	49364	49364	Luckily	179	“ You know how many people we employ ? ”
49372	49446	49365	49365	he	1595	“ Directly , we employ three hundred forty thousand people across ten offices worldwide . When you count vendors and subcontractors , it ’s double that . Those are real people with real lives and families and homes , people who depend on the health of this firm to make house payments and put food on the table . Do I want to announce that a Maltese is in charge of all that ? ”
49460	49501	49456	49456	I	0	“ No . I ’m not going to rock the company with that kind of announcement . I ’m showing them that things remain consistent after Bernadette ’s death . I want them feeling strong , steady , capable leadership . ”
49502	49505	49506	49506	I	0	“ Okay . ”
49780	49795	49796	49796	he	1197	“ You need to understand things to vote out of a place of knowledge , ”
49986	49995	49996	49996	I	0	“ How do you know everyone ’s names ? ”
50006	50014	49996	49996	I	0	“ I make a point of it . ”
50015	50025	49975	49975	He	102	“ But how ? You know so many names . ”
50026	50040	50041	50041	he	102	“ If something ’s important , you find a way to do it , ”
50059	50064	50049	50049	He	102	“ What was that ? ”
50970	50978	50979	50979	I	0	“ I know what you ’re doing , ”
51022	51029	51030	51030	He	102	“ Beyond the supposedly fake seduction ? ”
51206	51214	51215	51215	he	102	“ You know what I ’m doing ? ”
51218	51224	51215	51215	he	102	“ What would that be ? ”
51225	51236	51237	51237	I	0	“ You want me to love Locke like you do , ”
51244	51276	51237	51237	I	0	“ You ca n’t trick it out of my evil clutches , you ca n’t seduce me , so you ’re doing the next best thing . Trying to humanize it . ”
51277	51296	51215	51215	he	102	“ Do n’t count out the part where I seduce you . That ’s still going to happen . ”
51297	51300	51301	51301	I	0	“ Uh , ”
51307	51321	51301	51301	I	0	“ You probably think all women would just die for your magic peen . ”
51322	51328	51330	51330	he	102	“ Not all of them . ”
51337	51346	51330	51330	he	102	“ Just the ones I ’ve slept with . ”
51349	51404	51347	51347	Gulp	183	“ And for the record , my seduction of you is n’t goal oriented . I ’d seduce you if all you had was a dog bow tie Etsy store . Though , really , I should turn you in for animal cruelty . Because those bow ties you put Smuckers in ? No . ”
51405	51413	51476	51476	his	102	“ He likes his little bow ties . ”
51414	51418	51419	51419	Henry	102	“ Trust me , ”
51422	51432	51419	51419	Henry	102	“ He does n’t like the little bow ties . ”
51433	51441	51442	51442	His	102	“ I think you ’re just jealous . ”
51446	51453	51442	51442	His	102	“ That ’s what you think ? ”
51454	51463	51419	51419	Henry	102	“ Maybe I ’ll make one for you . ”
51464	51473	51474	51474	He	102	“ My neck has a lot of girth . ”
51479	51488	51476	51476	his	102	“ You ’d need a lot of sequins . ”
51520	51565	51517	51517	I	0	“ You ’re trying to make me see how important Locke is to all your family . Keeping me from killing it . You think I ’ll kill Locke , but you do n’t have to worry . Things are going to be okay . ”
51566	51578	51579	51579	he	102	“ I do n’t think you ’re going to kill it , ”
51621	51635	51615	51615	I	0	“ Right now , I ’m thinking about killing this . You mind ? ”
51667	51670	51671	51671	I	0	“ Crackly , ”
51757	51767	51736	51736	He	102	“ This would ’ve ended up in a landfill . ”
51782	51788	51768	51768	I	0	“ Did people say that ? ”
51789	51792	51793	51793	I	0	“ Apparently . ”

58013	58022	58023	58023	he	1753	“ I 'm sorry that happened to you , ”
58026	58031	58023	58023	he	1753	“ Something . Else . ”
58035	58062	58032	58032	He	1753	“ You know that model we fixed together ? With the trees ? And I would n’t tell you why it was important to fix it ? ”
58063	58066	57870	57870	He	1753	“ Yeah . ”
58067	58164	57870	57870	He	1753	“ Okay , well , now I ’m telling you . There ’s this guy , Renaldo , he ’s the one who made it . He eighty - five , one of the oldest guys in all of Locke . He helped my grandfather and father build the company , and he definitely has enough money to retire , but building is his life . Those models take him forever to make , but Brett and I feel like it keeps him alive . And if he saw the thing destroyed … he’d be crushed . ”
58165	58170	58032	58032	He	1753	“ You seemed mad . ”
58171	58307	57870	57870	He	1753	“ Well , who ’s leaving their bevs all over the model ? Right ? Anyway , he was kind of an uncle to Brett and me . As my dad got too busy to deal with us , Renaldo was the one who ’d take us around , make us learn the ropes with the trades . Brett and I would go and do our homework at that place , and if we finished in time , Renaldo would give us little assignments . Make a five - inch bridge out of ten toothpicks and a piece of string , stuff like that . And there would be a test , like the bridge would have to extend between blocks spaced five inches apart and be able to support a stack of ten quarters . ”
58308	58327	58032	58032	He	1753	“ A bridge made out of just a piece of string and toothpicks ? How is that possible ? ”
58328	58351	57870	57870	He	1753	“ You ’d be surprised what you can make from a piece of string and toothpicks . It ’s excellent building material . ”
58352	58391	58392	58392	He	1757	“ Maybe this is the part where you reassure me that even though it ’s excellent building material , you went on to use more durable materials in the construction of things like freight elevators in boutique hotels . ”
58403	58412	58392	58392	He	1757	“ This thing ’s solid steel , baby . ”
58426	58438	58413	58413	I	0	“ So you keep Renaldo on staff . That ’s sweet . ”
58439	58455	58461	58461	he	1757	“ He gave us an amazing education . He ’s a master builder — literally . ”
58477	58487	58470	58470	she	290	“ Did your mom help out with the company ? ”
58488	58491	58492	58492	He	1757	“ No . ”
58516	58536	58537	58537	I	0	“ I want to tell you something and have you hear me on it . Trust me on it . ”
58549	58552	58553	58553	He	1757	“ Yeah ? ”
58560	58570	58553	58553	He	1757	“ Your mother handed over the company to Smuckers . ”
58599	58620	58555	58555	his	1757	“ Things … tend to work themselves out . When something belongs to somebody , it tends to find them . ”
58621	58627	58628	58628	He	1757	“ What does that mean ? ”
58636	58654	58628	58628	He	1757	“ Is Smuckers giving back the company ? Is there something in the will that reverts it ? ”
58660	58670	58655	58655	I	0	“ Things work out , do n’t you find ? ”
58671	58678	58555	58555	his	1757	“ You ca n’t say more ? ”
58679	58704	58705	58705	I	0	“ I can swear to you that I never had my sights on Locke . I know you have no reason to trust me , ”
58708	58740	58705	58705	I	0	“ I know what the evidence makes it look like . What it makes me look like . I 'm not that terrible person . It ’s not what everyone thinks . ”
58766	58773	58798	58798	He	1761	“ I want you to believe . ”
58781	58793	58798	58798	He	1761	“ I need you to believe in spite of the evidence . ”
58794	58797	58798	58798	He	1761	“ Hey . ”
58809	58814	58798	58798	He	1761	“ I believe you . ”
58833	58842	58843	58843	He	1761	“ I believe you . I trust you . ”
58848	58853	58843	58843	He	1761	“ I see you . ”
58929	58937	58938	58938	I	0	“ Show me one of those bridges , ”
58941	58947	58938	58938	I	0	“ I want to see . ”
58960	58972	58973	58973	He	1761	“ Brett sent me this last year . This is before . ”
58997	59000	58994	58994	He	1761	“ After . ”
59013	59016	59017	59017	I	0	“ Awwww , ”
59020	59033	59017	59017	I	0	“ Wait , I might have one of the old successful ones . ”
59062	59066	59067	59067	he	1761	“ Hold up , ”
59070	59085	59067	59067	he	1761	“ Do n’t think I ’m letting you out before finding a successful one . ”
59267	59303	59264	59264	I	0	“ They used to make everything so ornate . Even the most lowly electrical thing was ornately designed . Buildings had pretty flourishes they did n’t need . Why do n’t they do it anymore ? ”
59304	59309	59310	59310	he	1761	“ We still do , ”
59313	59320	59321	59321	I	0	“ Just in a different way . ”
59333	59346	59347	59347	he	1761	“ How cool would it be incorporated into a table or seating ? ”
59431	59449	59499	59499	he	1761	“ I know how to get this made into furniture . More awesome than you can imagine . ”
59463	59467	59468	59468	His	1761	“ Tell me . ”
59597	59603	59590	59590	he	1761	“ You got a truck ? ”
59660	59674	59641	59641	I	0	“ Did you just ask Henry fucking Locke if he has a truck ? ”
59878	59889	59865	59865	We	1779	“ And you ’re not telling where we ’re going . ”
59890	59899	59900	59900	I	0	“ Take a left up here on Oakerton , ”
60212	60223	60224	60224	I	0	“ You have an alarm on this thing , right ? ”
60227	60233	60234	60234	he	1761	“ I ’m not worried , ”
60237	60250	60234	60234	he	1761	“ Who ’s going to steal a load of vintage construction debris ? ”
60251	60261	60262	60262	I	0	“ Um , you ’re about to meet them , ”
60362	60366	60355	60355	I	0	“ Lively today . ”
60381	60388	60389	60389	he	1813	“ What exactly is this place ? ”
60392	60406	60389	60389	he	1813	“ Southfield Place Makers Studio . It ’s a makers co - op . ”
60429	60442	60443	60443	I	0	“ You have to sign up for some of the larger tools , ”
60446	60451	60443	60443	I	0	“ They ’re shared . ”
60457	60474	60452	60452	I	0	“ That guy does n’t always follow the rules , but things usually go really smoothly . ”
60512	60519	60493	60493	Latrisha	155	“ You do your jewelry here ? ”
60520	60544	60549	60549	he	1813	“ Well , I need venting for soldering . I think I ’d get evicted from my apartment if I tried it there . ”
60545	60548	60549	60549	he	1813	“ Damn , ”
60625	60636	60637	60637	I	0	“ It seems a bit low rent , I know , ”
60640	60655	60637	60637	I	0	“ but it ’s a great deal and the tools here are really good . ”
60708	60797	60702	60702	Latrisha	155	“ And it ’s not like we let just anyone in , much as it might look like that . People have to pay monthly and we can kick them out if they ’re assholes . I mean , it ’s hard to do this kind of stuff in the city ; it ’s not like we all have sheds in our yard , or even yards , and when you look at the start - up capital for like , a woodworker or even someone like me — ”
60798	60801	60802	60802	he	1821	“ Vicky , ”
60815	60827	60828	60828	I	0	“ We all have lockers for our personal stuff over there , ”
60831	60835	60828	60828	I	0	“ Watch out . ”
60876	60881	60882	60882	I	0	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
60885	60890	60882	60882	I	0	“ It ’s nothing . ”
60891	60895	60896	60896	I	0	“ Tell me , ”
60904	60923	60899	60899	He	1821	“ It ’s a wealthy guy complaint . Trust me , you do n’t want to hear it . ”
60924	60933	60882	60882	I	0	“ I know it seems a little shabby . ”
60934	60942	60882	60882	I	0	“ You think that ’s the problem ? ”
60943	60949	60899	60899	He	1821	“ Or … low rent . ”
60950	60953	60954	60954	he	1821	“ Vicky , ”
60957	60969	60970	60970	he	1821	“ You ’re seriously apologizing for the state of the place ? ”
60973	60979	60970	60970	he	1821	“ It ’s utterly amazing . ”
60985	60990	60970	60970	he	1821	“ You think so ? ”
60991	60996	60899	60899	He	1821	“ I know so . ”
60997	61010	60899	60899	He	1821	“ I worried you ’d think it’s … I do n’t know . ”
61011	61087	60970	60970	he	1821	“ One of the little - understood things about having my kind of money is the insulation . It can be great — you’re insulated from tedious chores and time sucks , and I never have to talk to anybody who I specifically do n’t want to talk to ; other people talk to those people for me . But I ’m also insulated from something like this . I literally ca n’t have this . ”
61088	61095	60899	60899	He	1821	“ You could if you wanted . ”
61096	61164	61165	61165	He	1823	“ Yeah , okay , technically I can , because it ’s a free country , but I ’d almost have to come as somebody else . Like a poser . Look at me . I could buy an airplane hangar and fill it with the best tools money can buy before dinner . I ’d have to take a space from somebody who actually needs it . ”
61171	61190	61165	61165	He	1823	“ This place is awesome . And I can never be one of the people who belong here . ”
61236	61255	61226	61226	I	0	“ I wanted you to like it . It ’s one of my favorite places in the world . ”
61260	61268	61256	61256	His	1823	“ I like it a whole lot . ”
61301	61310	61311	61311	he	1823	“ Do you have a lot of collaboration ? ”
61314	61327	61311	61311	he	1823	“ Do people walk around and see what each other is doing ? ”
61328	61367	61392	61392	Latrisha	155	“ Yeah , people hook up on projects , but it ’s not as if we ’re walking around all dude , please tell me about this awesome creation of yours ! That would be a little dorky . ”
61368	61376	61377	61377	he	1823	“ They hook up from the lounge , ”
61380	61386	61387	61387	I	0	“ More often than not , ”
61447	61473	61441	61441	she	155	“ Latrisha , this is Henry . Henry , this is Latrisha . She makes furniture out of reclaimed stuff and it ’s freaking amazing . ”
61474	61477	61478	61478	he	102	“ Hey , ”
61485	61492	61478	61478	he	102	“ So nice to meet you . ”
61493	61496	61441	61441	she	155	“ Likewise . ”
61539	61548	61533	61533	her	155	“ I ’ve heard a lot about you . ”
61549	61565	61566	61566	Henry	102	“ I think I might be familiar with one of your recent pieces , actually , ”
61606	61619	61620	61620	She	155	“ I love this burnished effect . How did you get it ? ”
62144	62157	62158	62158	Latrisha	155	“ Oh , how far we ’ve come from the dog throne , ”
62167	62170	62158	62158	Latrisha	155	“ What ? ”
62171	62191	62192	62192	I	0	“ You ’ve done a one - eighty . From wanting to mess with him to quite the opposite . ”
62202	62209	62192	62192	I	0	“ What happened to the asshole ? ”
62210	62240	62158	62158	Latrisha	155	“ His company is his family and , yeah , he ’s a complete asshole to anyone who threatens it . Which he saw as me , I suppose — ”
62241	62261	62262	62262	I	0	“ If he really knew you , he would know you ’re the most trustworthy person on the planet . ”
62481	62494	62477	62477	They	1855	“ We ’ve come to a good place . It ’s complicated . ”
62495	62499	62500	62500	she	155	“ Record scratch ! ”
62503	62510	62500	62500	she	155	“ Did you sleep with him ? ”
62511	62514	62477	62477	They	1855	“ Weeeeeell … ”
62515	62524	62525	62525	she	155	“ Oh - em - eff - gee , ”
62528	62537	62525	62525	she	155	“ No , we did n’t do it ... ”
62563	62572	62553	62553	his	102	“ But you ’ve been doing each other . ”
62573	62577	62578	62578	I	0	“ We have . ”
62587	62597	62578	62578	I	0	“ And it ’s amazing . He ’s amazing . ”
62598	62618	62619	62619	she	155	“ I thought he did n’t trust you . Like you ’re this weasely scammer who stole his company , ”
62622	62628	62619	62619	she	155	“ What happened to that ? ”
62629	62664	62578	62578	I	0	“ We ’ve gotten to know each other — deep down , beneath all the bullshit of this situation . We click . It ’s amazing . And I ’m giving the company back . ”

62673	62710	62619	62619	she	155	“ Do n’t tell him . I did n’t actually tell him , but I implied it . Carly and I have that twenty - one - day waiting period thing and promising is the same … ”
62711	62752	62578	62578	I	0	“ Bernadette gave it to Smuckers and you because you two were her only friends in the universe . She wanted you to have it . That is your security . You and Carly . You would give that up ? ”
62753	62763	62578	62578	I	0	“ It does n’t feel right to keep it . ”
62764	62782	62619	62619	she	155	“ What part of going from scrabbling along to super wealthy does n’t feel right to you ? ”
62783	62813	62578	62578	I	0	“ All of it . Carly and I were getting on fine . We have a great life just how it is . And the company was never ours . ”
62814	62824	62825	62825	She	1858	“ So , let me get this timeline straight . ”
62839	62905	62825	62825	She	1858	“ He ’s an asshole to you . He plays dirty tricks . It does n’t work . Then he decides to be charming . And we know the tales of him in the sack . I 'm sorry . I know he ’s hot . He ’s smart and fun . But he ’s not one of us . He just wants that company . ”

62924	62966	62921	62921	her	1858	“ He ’s spending time with you and he ’s all that . And suddenly you ’re handing over the company . You — who hate rich , entitled assholes until this one decides to wrap you around his worldwide cock . ”
62973	62980	62921	62921	her	1858	“ I know how it looks . ”
62981	62991	62921	62921	her	1858	“ Is that or is that not the timeline ? ”
62996	63002	63018	63018	she	1858	“ I do n’t care . ”
63003	63017	63018	63018	she	1858	“ You need to start caring . This rich boy is playing you , ”
63021	63037	63018	63018	she	1858	“ Your first instinct was not to trust him . You need to honor that . ”
63038	63047	63018	63018	she	1858	“ My instinct is to trust him now . ”

63573	63579	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ Our PI got back . ”
63583	63586	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ Right . ”
63587	63606	63607	63607	I	0	“ Listen to this — it ’s fake . Extremely professional , extremely expensive , extremely fake identities . ”
63612	63620	63607	63607	I	0	“ Does he have proof of this ? ”
63621	63675	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ He ’s getting it . It ’s involving bribes at a federal level . There are no photographs of the two of them online prior to seven years ago . He thinks she might be connected . The ID is mob - level good . This is a five - alarm fire . ”
63676	63697	63698	63698	I	0	“ Mob ? No . She ’s not connected . She ’s not a con . I 'm telling you , ”

63716	63744	63713	63713	Brett	127	“ Has he ? No . Never . Pull your head out of your ass . She posed as a pet whisperer and bilked an old lady . ”

63763	63769	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ In so many words . ”
63770	63790	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ She ’s giving back the company . But did she do it ? Did she draw up papers ? ”
63791	63815	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ I think there ’s more to the will . I do n’t know . She ’s not in it for the money . ”
63816	63830	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ Are you kidding me ? Wait . You ’re sleeping with her . ”
63831	63841	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ No , I ’m telling you what is . ”
63842	63853	63580	63581	The PI	158	“ Dude . You do n’t even know her name ! ”
63854	63867	63868	63868	I	0	“ There could be lots of reasons an ID might be false , ”

64473	64568	64569	64569	I	0	“ Not just a nicer lounge area , but it needs larger and more functional collaboration spaces . The way we all had to crowd into Latrisha ’s area ? No . You could double the workspace if you expanded to the upper level . There could be cots , sleeping rental by the hour , Japanese - hotel style . Hire a manager to oversee the tools and double as a barista and referee , and the stuff you ’d sell would pay their hourly and you ’d have somebody quasi - managing . ”
64632	64637	64638	64638	she	1880	“ That ’s brilliant , ”

66314	66387	66311	66311	I	0	“ You think she signed up for Team Bernadette ? Dude , your mom stalked her . She pursued her , manipulated her . Vicky did everything she could to avoid that woman , but she wheedled into her life and Vicky took pity on her and she made sure she was safe and all of that . And now here you are , screwing with her , too . Lay off . ”

They put this ridiculous outfit on her . And your mother comes along and Vicky ’s like , Smuckers enjoys hearing you sing , and your mother was convinced she had dog whisperer powers from then on . ”

And they ’d run into each other by accident after that , and your mom would be all , You have to tell me what Smuckers is thinking ! Offering her money and stuff . And Vicky would insist she was n’t a pet whisperer , insist there ’s no such thing . Your mom thought Vicky was withholding her psychic gift from her . Out of spite or something . ”

70573	70580	70581	70581	she	99	“ Wait . Close your eyes , ”

70705	70739	70702	70702	I	0	“ He got up there somehow and got some photos , and he carved it . This is all Henry — this vision . The passion of it . The way he knew . ”
70740	70747	70761	70761	She	99	“ You ’re quite the expert . ”

70955	70958	70959	70959	She	146	“ Hey ! ”
70969	70977	70959	70959	She	146	“ We did n’t expect you guys . ”
70978	70983	70959	70959	She	146	“ Where is everyone ? ”
70984	70987	70988	70988	she	146	“ Queens , ”
71002	71006	70988	70988	she	146	“ The Ten ? ”
71007	71013	70959	70959	She	146	“ Is something going on ? ”
71014	71019	71020	71020	Her	146	“ The emergency meeting ? ”
71025	71031	70988	70988	she	146	“ You do n’t know ? ”
71032	71035	70959	70959	She	146	“ No . ”
71036	71070	71071	71071	I	0	“ They carried on as if you knew . I assumed you did n’t want to come — it ’s more detail than you usually get into . It ’s an emergency meeting . ”
71080	71089	71071	71071	I	0	“ Well , let ’s get a car . ”
71116	71122	71123	71123	April	146	“ It came up fast , ”
71126	71137	71123	71123	April	146	“ The project is in jeopardy . It ’s bad . ”
71138	71142	71169	71169	She	146	“ What happened ? ”
71143	71156	71169	71169	She	146	“ Dartford & Sons . They ’re blowhards . Total asshole developers . ”
71157	71168	71169	71169	She	146	“ So I ’ve heard . What ’d they do ? ”
71177	71230	71169	71169	She	146	“ Here ’s the thing with a development like the Ten — if Locke tells the neighbors about their plans before they ’ve bought up all the properties , word will leak and a competitor will buy one key lot and hold it hostage . Dartford & Sons is notorious for that . ”
71231	71244	71169	71169	She	146	“ So Dartford bought a lot in the middle of the Ten ? ”
71245	71309	71169	71169	She	146	“ No — we just closed on the last property , so the Dartford brothers ca n’t wreck it that way . Instead , they poisoned the neighbors against it . Acted like Locke has been doing things in secret . They ’ll get the councilperson to veto the project , make the land worthless , then try and get a racetrack through . ”
71310	71319	71320	71320	I	0	“ Who wants a racetrack in their neighborhood ? ”
71323	71346	71320	71320	I	0	“ Nobody , but the Dartford brothers’ll bribe and lie their way into projects . They cross lines most people wo n’t . ”

71875	71882	71883	71883	April	146	“ Those guys are Dartford plants , ”
71886	71931	71883	71883	April	146	“ Planted in the audience to sink this project . They ’ll complain about the amount of greenery , which always rallies people . And they ’ll complain about the lack of public input — which they would actually get more of with Locke . ”
71969	71974	71975	71975	I	0	“ This is bad , ”
71978	72034	71975	71975	I	0	“ It is . Once those assholes have their no vote , they ’ll bribe some council people and put their racetrack in . But we ca n’t say that , because it has n’t happened yet . Once it ’s done it ’s too late . They have people , let ’s just say . ”
72069	72072	72073	72073	April	146	“ Lies , ”
72076	72091	72073	72073	April	146	“ Their motto should be Where doing the wrong thing is the right thing . ”
72161	72174	72150	72150	Brett	127	“ One question — are you being paid by Dartford & Sons ? ”
72204	72213	72214	72214	I	0	“ Why are they listening to those jerks ? ”
72236	72246	72247	72247	she	146	“ There ’s no more yes in the room , ”
72251	72261	72247	72247	she	146	“ Dartford & Sons are officially sinking the Ten . ”
72267	72295	72264	72264	her	146	“ These neighbors are going to get screwed . And it ’s Henry ’s birthday next week , and all he ’ll get is the final dissolution … ”
72339	72346	72350	72350	them	2093	“ Oh , this is perfect , ”
72354	72367	72350	72350	them	2093	“ Is this the dog ? The new owner of Locke Worldwide ? ”
72368	72377	72378	72378	April	146	“ No , no , no , no , ”
72384	72387	72378	72378	April	146	“ Shit . ”
72474	72478	72479	72479	he	2092	“ Tell me , ”
72486	72497	72498	72498	He	2092	“ can you trust a company led by a dog ? ”
72503	72573	72574	72574	He	2092	“ You ’re the dog ’s keeper ? Do n’t you think this is a little reckless for a publicity stunt ? To literally hand control of a company to a dog and his keeper ? This dog legally controls the entire firm , does he not ? This dog could sell the company for a dollar to a kid on the street . Is that a trustworthy move ? ”
72617	72622	72613	72613	He	127	“ Leave her alone . ”
72623	72632	72633	72633	Dartford	53	“ You have anything to say for yourself ? ”
72680	72684	72685	72685	Dartford	53	“ Come on , ”
72722	72733	72720	72720	Vonda	122	“ The leader of the company has nothing to say ? ”
72767	72792	72754	72754	I	0	“ Does the leader of the company have anything to say ? You want to know ? Well , how about it , Smuckers ? ”
72802	72807	72808	72808	I	0	“ Oh , dear , ”
72816	72832	72814	72814	Dartford	53	“ Smuckers says he is so sick of your shit . He ca n’t even . ”
72845	72849	72850	72850	Dartford	53	“ Very amusing , ”
72914	72948	72907	72907	I	0	“ Smuckers here thought he was going to a nice community meeting where we talk about making a neighborhood nicer , but instead , it ’s battle of the jerky titans . Please . ”
72956	72960	72954	72954	Chuckles	210	“ Very funny . ”
72992	73000	73001	73001	I	0	“ Is Smuckers in charge of this ? ”
73008	73089	73001	73001	I	0	“ Right now he is . This guy ’s right . A dog is literally in charge of a worldwide development and finance company . Here ’s the thing . Smuckers agrees with a lot of you about more green space , not less . He thinks so many buildings are just huge pieces of shit — new ones are the worst . Maybe they win awards , but seriously ? Smuckers believes in human- and dog - centered design . ”
73095	73100	73093	73093	Somebody	407	“ More fire hydrants ! ”
73101	73108	73109	73109	Kaleb	135	“ Nobody ’s redesigning this project , ”

73124	73146	73122	73122	Kaleb	135	“ Why ca n’t we ? Smuckers does n’t understand . Why ca n’t it be nicer , like a garden ? ”
73158	73173	73174	73174	Kaleb	135	“ Because it took a year to design , and that phase is over , ”
73177	73199	73174	73174	Kaleb	135	“ Smuckers does n’t understand . If people do n’t like it , why not make a new design ? Right ? ”
73205	73210	73211	73211	Kaleb	135	“ We ca n’t , ”
73232	73284	73229	73229	their	2112	“ But here ’s the thing . Smuckers hates racetracks . He thinks they ’re messy and noisy and bring a lot of traffic and are horrible in a residential area , and he knows you guys are going to put it in . I mean , seriously ? A racetrack ? ”
73285	73293	73229	73229	their	2112	“ We ’re planning no such thing . ”
73294	73331	73229	73229	their	2112	“ Smuckers says that everyone in the building community knows you are . You tried to get one in on Brockton Greens , right ? You have partners looking with you . Is n’t that right ? ”
73332	73344	73229	73229	their	2112	“ I do n’t know what ridiculous rumors you ’ve heard . ”
73345	73368	73372	73372	He	53	“ Smuckers wants to know if you ’d sign a thing right here swearing you would n’t ever build a racetrack here . ”
73387	73392	73393	73393	He	53	“ This is silly . ”
73410	73437	73399	73399	I	0	“ What is that , Smuckers ? You think it ’s suspicious they wo n’t sign a thing like that ? I think so , too ! ”
73446	73464	73438	73438	I	0	“ Henry , Smuckers wants you to put up that slide of the neighborhood - facing structure . ”
73465	73473	73474	73474	he	53	“ We ’re done with that slide , ”
73477	73485	73486	73486	I	0	“ Smuckers wants to see it again , ”

73618	73628	73615	73615	he	127	“ That ’s not really the question , though ... ”
73629	73635	73636	73636	Kaleb	135	“ There are cost issues , ”
73639	73654	73636	73636	Kaleb	135	“ With every square foot lost , the cost of the remaining goes up . ”
73655	73664	73665	73665	I	0	“ So what if the cost goes up ? ”
73668	73705	73665	73665	I	0	“ If it ’s cool . Let ’s see options . Something will have to go in to replace the factories that are moving out . What does it look like if it ’s something better ? ”
73817	73829	73830	73830	he	127	“ How about this . We could integrate something like this , ”
73833	73848	73830	73830	he	127	“ This landscape is brown . Imagine it full of greenery and natural light . ”
73857	73889	73890	73890	He	127	“ Look how the natural light flows . And this gathering space . We can do this . We can have this . We ’d do benches along here . Greenery . ”

76441	76479	76438	76438	I	0	“ And you need to answer honestly . What is up with the Dartford brothers ? Do they just sit around rubbing their hands and dreaming of building what people most do n’t want them to build ? ”
76480	76490	76524	76524	Henry	102	“ And then laugh maniacally ? Something like that . ”

I think they sense their powerlessness sometimes . Then you step in with the Smuckers thing , and it was brilliant . And you were on their side , and they knew it was genuine . ”

Kaleb ’s protests ? We could n’t have staged it better if we tried . Like we ’d written a script for him . It could n’t have been better . It really was like a dog is pushing everyone around , which I guess it was . It ’s the most bizarre thing I ’ve seen in all my years in business . You and Smuckers did what we could n’t do in an hour of yelling — you made them open their minds and listen . You opened the door to a redesign of the Ten . ”

83186	83195	83196	83196	I	0	“ You just touched it , really lightly . ”

83324	83342	83343	83343	I	0	“ I honestly do n’t know if that clinches your Most Eligible Bastard status or destroys it , ”
83346	83351	83352	83352	he	127	“ Do n’t even , ”
83367	83379	83364	83364	I	0	“ And to think I imagined you did n’t like dogs . ”
83380	83393	83394	83394	He	127	“ That has to be the last joke you make about that . ”
83404	83415	83416	83416	He	127	“ The last ? Is n’t that a little extreme ? ”
83421	83436	83416	83416	He	127	“ I mean it . Or I might retaliate in the most excruciating way . ”
83437	83443	83444	83444	I	0	“ I might like it , ”
83447	83454	83444	83444	I	0	“ But okay . Last joke . ”
83484	83491	83492	83492	she	100	“ You think the sauce survived ? ”
83495	83501	83492	83492	she	100	“ I know it did . ”

84145	84164	84165	84165	She	2237	“ You want to get out of the city ? I have a beach place in the Hamptons . ”
84192	84197	84187	84187	she	2237	“ What is it ? ”
84198	84201	84202	84202	She	2237	“ Well … ”

84519	84552	84511	84511	She	2237	“ Not for a weekend . I mean , she ’s sixteen . She would probably be fine . She ’d love me to leave her with the place to herself but — ”
84553	84567	84568	84568	I	0	“ I did n’t mean just you , I meant both of you , ”
84571	84615	84568	84568	I	0	“ I ’d love to meet her and have her up with us . The best beach is just a few blocks away . We have a full staff . She can have her own room . We could leave Friday , early . ”

84803	84846	84799	84799	She	2239	“ Of course , they might not get much studying done . Two of the guys from One Direction have rented the place next to mine . They might be rehearsing for some kind of duet tour . It could be distracting . ”
84852	84855	84799	84799	She	2239	“ Seriously ? ”
84856	84866	84847	84847	Her	2239	“ Would I joke about something like One Direction ? ”
84867	84873	84874	84874	she	2239	“ This feels like blackmail , ”
84877	84895	84874	84874	she	2239	“ If I do n’t say yes and she finds out , she ’ll literally kill me . ”
84896	84902	84903	84903	I	0	“ That would be terrible , ”
85062	85074	85075	85075	I	0	“ I know it ’s not what you ’re used to , ”
85080	85089	85090	85090	she	219	“ It ’s a breath of fresh air , ”
85093	85102	85090	85090	she	219	“ You know how messy teenaged girls are ? ”
85103	85121	85122	85122	I	0	“ It ’s thrilling to see you have … friends here . We ’re all so pleased . ”
85334	85342	85343	85343	I	0	“ You take good care of her , ”
85447	85455	85456	85456	she	100	“ We ’re all each other has , ”

85673	85680	85669	85669	Her	100	“ Why would you think that ? ”
85681	85713	85714	85714	She	100	“ Just wondering . You ’re not impressed like a lot of people are . And , well , you did call me a rich , entitled jackass at one point . ”
85719	85728	85714	85714	She	100	“ You know I do n’t think that . ”
85773	85785	85786	85786	She	100	“ Did my mother seem … happy in those last years ? ”
85791	85794	85786	85786	She	100	“ Henry — ”
85795	85811	85786	85786	She	100	“ I just … didn’t know her the last few years . I missed her . ”
85818	85827	85828	85828	I	0	“ She seemed happy … in her way . ”
85831	85884	85828	85828	I	0	“ I was n’t sure how much you wanted to know about her . But , yes . She had her routines and Smuckers . She ’d terrorize people in the neighborhood , like when they wanted to pet him , she ’d act angry . That was kind of her jam . ”
85900	85907	85908	85908	I	0	“ She was such a character , ”
85911	85937	85908	85908	I	0	“ I always imagined I could repair things . That somehow I ’d break through and we ’d have a heart - to - heart . ”

86009	86018	86019	86019	I	0	“ I ’m glad she had you around , ”
86029	86037	86022	86022	She	2278	“ I ’m glad I could be . ”
86038	86048	86022	86022	She	2278	“ Why do you think my mother chose you ? ”
86049	86055	86022	86022	She	2278	“ I do n’t know , ”
86059	86103	86056	86056	she	2278	“ Maybe it ’s silly to keep wondering about it , but I do . Do you think my mother chose you because she sensed you have an allergy to guys like me ? Did you two talk about that sort of thing ? ”
86104	86107	86022	86022	She	2278	“ Hmm . ”
86108	86146	86022	86022	She	2278	“ I know she ostensibly chose you on the basis of your being a dog whisperer , but she could ’ve done a lot of messed - up things with that will . Yet she chose you . ”
86147	86157	86158	86158	she	2278	“ I really think it was about the dog , ”
86161	86176	86158	86158	she	2278	“ She loved that dog . Even the last words she said to me … ”
86187	86197	86198	86198	I	0	“ It ’s okay , you can tell me , ”
86201	86220	86198	86198	I	0	“ Please . Tell me . They were the last words she said . I want to know . ”

86256	86311	86312	86312	I	0	“ I love you , Pokey . I do n't know why she called Smuckers that , you know , there at the end . I never heard her call him that , but it had to be Smuckers she was talking to . Smuckers is a little pokey , you have to admit . ”
86321	86326	86327	86327	she	2282	“ What is it ? ”
86336	86340	86341	86341	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
86344	86348	86341	86341	I	0	“ For what ? ”

86707	86730	86704	86704	I	0	“ Because if they were right out there over the water ? I ’d have to arrest myself for multiple cliché violations . ”
86731	86747	86748	86748	she	100	“ The foam on the waves is just as bright . It looks almost neon , ”
86760	86766	86748	86748	she	100	“ It ’s the phosphorescence . ”
86795	86799	86782	86782	she	100	“ Come here . ”
87072	87083	87065	87065	Henry	217	“ Have I told you how hot you are recently ? ”
87121	87136	87137	87137	I	0	“ It ’s been so long since I was just happy . Stupidly happy , ”
87163	87167	87145	87145	him	217	“ Thank you . ”
87168	87177	87178	87178	he	217	“ Does it make you a little sad ? ”
87194	87200	87201	87201	I	0	“ Did I sound sad ? ”
87216	87223	87224	87224	he	217	“ I ’m happy , too , ”
87228	87237	87224	87224	he	217	“ But nothing about my happiness feels stupid . ”
87542	87549	87535	87535	He	217	“ You do n’t have to — ”
87550	87580	87581	87581	I	0	“ If you think I ’m not man enough to carry a flowered dog carrier that looks like a purse , you have n’t been paying attention , baby . ”

87824	87838	87810	87810	Brett	127	“ I want you to meet our new leadership consultant , Denny Woodruff . ”
87866	87870	87871	87871	Henry	127	“ Leadership consultant ? ”
87906	87920	87921	87921	Brett	127	“ Denny’ll be working closely with us on board leadership and cohesiveness issues , ”
87934	87987	87921	87921	Brett	127	“ I think this will be especially helpful to you , Vicky . To get you integrated , to get us working in tandem instead of at odds . You ’ll be working very closely with Denny . Every board meeting , Denny will be right there , helping you integrate productively . ”
87993	87998	87999	87999	Henry	127	“ What is this ? ”
88002	88010	88011	88011	He	127	“ Vicky does n’t need leadership consulting . ”
88018	88024	88025	88025	He	127	“ What ’s going on ? ”
88035	88049	88050	88050	Brett	127	“ Kaleb and I agree this could really be good for the board , ”
88053	88094	88095	88095	He	127	“ We made the move . It ’s within our rights to add a board consultant . We do n’t need a majority for that , just twenty - five percent . His salary is a matter of operations budget … ”
88150	88177	88139	88139	He	130	“ I ’ve done a lot of work with the Percival Group . I went to Yale with Dale Runson , who I think you know . ”
88195	88198	88190	88190	She	146	“ Okay . ”
88226	88242	88219	88219	He	127	“ Let ’s take five . I need a sidebar here with you and Kaleb . ”
88243	88250	88251	88251	Brett	127	“ Denny ’s a board consultant , ”
88254	88267	88251	88251	Brett	127	“ The point here is to include him , even in sidebars . ”
88273	88313	88268	88268	Brett	127	“ You do n’t have a problem with this , do you , Vicky ? Part of being a competent board member is to work well with others . If you do n’t think you can work with Denny … ”
88317	88340	88314	88314	Denny	130	“ Vicky ! I ’m excited for the opportunity to work with you . I feel like we accomplish a lot together . ”
88375	88380	88369	88369	Denny	130	“ I promise you — ”

89142	89146	89137	89137	Henry	217	“ You know . ”
89147	89151	89079	89079	He	2342	“ Know what ? ”
89152	89160	89079	89079	He	2342	“ They did n’t fill you in ? ”
89161	89204	89137	89137	Henry	217	“ Baby , I just ran halfway down a skyscraper stairwell until I could get an elevator and then down two crowded blocks , pissing off about five dozen bumbling pedestrians trying to find you . I ’ve been a little busy . ”
89205	89216	89079	89079	He	2342	“ How ’d you know I ’d go this way ? ”
89217	89226	89079	89079	He	2342	“ Who cares ? What ’s going on ? ”
89233	89244	89245	89245	I	0	“ That Denny guy back there . What was that ? ”
89266	89303	89258	89258	He	2342	“ Calls from the tower . Probably Brett . What happens when I answer ? I ’ve had him blocked all weekend . What happens when I unblock him ? What am I going to see ? ”
89312	89315	89316	89316	I	0	“ Uh , ”
89339	89346	89347	89347	he	2342	“ Well , that answers that , ”
89350	89362	89347	89347	he	2342	“ A forehead print . That ’s what I ’ll see . ”
89368	89372	89373	89373	I	0	“ No joke , ”
89413	89419	89407	89407	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
89420	89436	89389	89389	His	2342	“ I did n’t want you to know . I thought you ’d never know . ”

89545	89549	89550	89550	I	0	“ Vonda O’Neil ? ”
89554	89576	89550	89550	I	0	“ You do n’t remember liar Vonda O’Neil ? The whole sordid scandal eight years back ? Everyone remembers Vonda O’Neil . ”
89602	89605	89596	89596	he	2344	“ Wait — ”
89606	89611	89612	89612	I	0	“ That ’s right , ”
89615	89621	89612	89612	I	0	“ You ’re Vonda O’Neil . ”
89622	89625	89626	89626	I	0	“ Ding . ”
89643	89651	89626	89626	I	0	“ And Denny Woodruff … that was — ”
89652	89664	89665	89665	I	0	“ Denny . The wronged victim , yeah . Falsely accused , ”
89668	89686	89665	89665	I	0	“ The poor sweet boy with his bright future that was threatened by selfish , lying Vonda . ”
89750	89763	89733	89733	I	0	“ Remember ? The trial ? The world - famous mayo shirt ? ”
89764	89796	89725	89725	He	127	“ Oh , right . The shirt was supposed to prove he ’d kidnapped and … tried to assault you . You said it was semen , but it was mayo . ”
89797	89804	89725	89725	He	127	“ Yup . It was mayo . ”
89805	89822	89733	89733	I	0	“ That was you ? Wait — the well . You ended up in a well . ”
89823	89832	89725	89725	He	127	“ You did n’t pay very good attention . ”
89833	89839	89725	89725	He	127	“ I was in college . ”
89840	89887	89733	89733	I	0	“ I hid in a well as part of my plot to destroy Denny ’s future . I pretended I fell in there . Three days I was in there . All the better to get media attention . It ’s what I wanted all along . ”
89894	89905	89906	89906	he	127	“ So this is what you ’re going to do ? ”
89910	89919	89906	89906	he	127	“ Do n’t I get the real story ? ”
89977	89984	89985	89985	he	127	“ I thought you trusted me , ”
89995	89999	89988	89988	I	0	“ Tell me . ”
90027	90032	90033	90033	he	127	“ It ’s me , ”
90041	90047	90033	90033	he	127	“ Just you and me . ”
90211	90214	90206	90206	Denny	130	“ Fuck , ”
90219	90227	90215	90215	Henry	127	“ I shoulda killed him in there . ”
90239	90256	90257	90257	He	130	“ Do n’t worry , I wo n’t really kill him . Maybe . Then what ? ”
90266	90299	90257	90257	He	130	“ I always think it was my terror of him that made him ejaculate all over my shirt instead of getting to the final act . Like my terror turned him on . ”
90308	90312	90313	90313	he	130	“ Keep going , ”
90316	90325	90313	90313	he	130	“ You ’re okay . We ’re okay . ”
90353	90358	90339	90339	he	130	“ Left you there . ”
90359	90417	90328	90328	him	130	“ Yeah . And something in me kicked in , working at that knot . I freed myself even as his boots crunched the gravel outside . I grabbed my panties and my shoes and ran out the back , pounding feet over cutting branches . I barely felt it . I just had to get away . ”
90418	90427	90488	90488	him	130	“ In bare feet . Through the woods . ”
90428	90485	90486	90486	I	0	“ I hardly felt it until I fell into that well . It was deep , but I only sprained my right ankle and broke the toe of my left . It could ’ve been worse , but the thing was filled with years of brush and leaves and dirt , and that cushioned my fall . ”
90632	90640	90630	90630	Terrified	228	“ That ’s why you stayed quiet . ”
90641	90649	90630	90630	Terrified	228	“ Three days I was in there . ”
90820	90830	90831	90831	I	0	“ It was only later I remembered my shirt , ”
90835	90883	90831	90831	I	0	“ I opened up the bag and found the crusty stain and I realized he ’d , you know , the shirt . Mom is the one who kept back the shirt . I was sixteen . I was n’t thinking five moves ahead like she was . ”
90926	90983	90921	90921	They	2365	“ I thought we should bring it to the police , but she said we should keep it for the trial . She said we could n’t trust the police , that we needed to keep the evidence . The Woodruffs tried to pay me off . A half a million dollars . Five hundred thousand . ”
90984	91005	90900	90905	The people of the Financial District	2365	“ That must ’ve seemed like a lot of money to you . You passed up a lot of money . ”
91006	91025	91026	91026	I	0	“ I wanted to stand up for other girls . I had evidence … I felt so sure … ”
91040	91059	91060	91060	I	0	“ I was so sure I ’d be able to prove it with that shirt , you know ? ”
91063	91136	91060	91060	I	0	“ When it came back as mayonnaise , I thought the police lab was lying . Like the Woodruffs paid off the lab , and I demanded an independent analysis . Mayo again . By that time , I was this monster . Months later , I found the bank statement from my mom ’s account . Twenty thousand dollars deposited into it the day before we produced the shirt for testing . ”
91137	91141	91142	91142	he	2369	“ The Woodruffs , ”
91145	91231	91142	91142	he	2369	“ It was a pretty common shirt from Savemart . I think they bought a duplicate and switched it . The mayo would ’ve been the Woodruffs ’ idea . My mother would never have thought of something so devious and damning . The mayo is what made me look like I deliberately tried to frame him . Like a teen without sophisticated knowledge of forensic techniques tried to frame this rich boy . Everybody hated me . The world was this wall of hate . ”
91232	91240	91241	91241	he	2369	“ The betrayal you were talking about , ”
91244	91253	91241	91241	he	2369	“ That was your mom selling the shirt . ”
91257	91278	91254	91254	I	0	“ There was nothing she would n’t do . She was a good mom before Dad died . But after … ”
91284	91304	91279	91279	I	0	“ But I just wanted justice . I wanted the world to know what kind of guy Denny is . ”
91327	91332	91320	91320	I	0	“ You believe me ? ”
91333	91339	91340	91340	I	0	“ What ? Of course . ”
91345	91355	91340	91340	I	0	“ Because of how I was in the elevator ? ”
91356	91373	91374	91374	My	0	“ No , because of how you are period . Because I know who you are . ”
91380	91391	91374	91374	My	0	“ You did n’t even know my name until now . ”
91392	91402	91403	91403	I	0	“ A name is n’t who a person is . ”
91426	91430	91403	91403	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
91431	91478	91504	91504	He	2369	“ Do n’t thank me . After what you ’ve been through ? I do n’t remember the specifics of the case , but I sure remember the Vonda O’Neil feeding frenzy . I remember that . And you were innocent all that time . God . ”
91526	91534	91535	91535	I	0	“ That ’s when you came here ? ”
91538	91671	91672	91672	He	2371	“ My mom took a year to burn through the money . She had a lot of bad boyfriends . She was going downhill . It got less and less safe for me and Carly as the money dwindled . I ’d been secretly saving , though . And then I did an interview they paid me for , and that was a lot of money . That was what I used to move one night . I just took her and ran . I did n’t want Carly to stay back there . It was n’t safe for either of us , but especially not Carly . I mean , it was n’t always so bad . Before my dad died , we were a normal family . A happy family . ”
91680	91687	91672	91672	He	2371	“ I ca n’t even imagine . ”
91688	91693	91694	91694	I	0	“ You believe me , ”
91706	91712	91703	91703	his	2371	“ Of course I do . ”
91718	91729	91730	91730	he	2371	“ I do n’t know how you could doubt it , ”
91733	91781	91730	91730	he	2371	“ I mean , after all those hours we spent in that little workroom toiling side - by - side using toothpicks and glue to get tiny paper curlicues to stick to tiny paper tree trunks ? When two people go through an experience like that together … ”
91792	91832	91782	91782	I	0	“ Seriously , even if I had n’t been in that elevator shaft with you , where it was , let ’s face it , pretty obvious you ’re not somebody who would ’ve gone into a well voluntarily — ”
91833	91838	91839	91839	I	0	“ I would never , ”
91842	91859	91839	91839	I	0	“ I know . And also , Denny ? That ’s not a good guy there . ”
91860	91865	91782	91782	I	0	“ You know him ? ”
91866	91890	91782	91782	I	0	“ Jesus , the way he came at you ? Do n’t need to taste much to know if it ’s cottage cheese . ”
91891	91896	91897	91897	He	2372	“ You punched him . ”
91921	91940	91918	91918	his	2372	“ If I knew what I know now , I would ’ve put him right through that glass . ”
92147	92153	92154	92154	she	158	“ It hums with blueness , ”
92157	92160	92161	92161	I	0	“ Unbelievable , ”
92267	92273	92274	92274	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry , ”
92280	92292	92274	92274	I	0	“ What did you do ? You did n’t invite him . ”
92293	92305	92324	92324	She	158	“ I started those wheels in motion . Scheming with Brett . ”
92306	92323	92324	92324	She	158	“ I do n’t blame you . In no universe would I blame you for that . ”
92401	92405	92395	92395	She	158	“ Come here . ”
92417	92422	92423	92423	she	158	“ I feel better , ”
92426	92430	92423	92423	she	158	“ Thank you . ”

92518	92531	92532	92532	I	0	“ I think I ’m man enough to knit a tea cozy , ”
92542	92554	92539	92539	She	158	“ Oh , you ’re man enough to crochet a doily . ”
92698	92705	92706	92706	she	158	“ I like feeding you cookies , ”
92709	92714	92715	92715	I	0	“ That ’s convenient , ”
92718	92728	92715	92715	I	0	“ Because I like your fingers in my mouth . ”
92729	92732	92745	92745	She	158	“ Yeah ? ”

93790	93799	93787	93787	She	158	“ I think I will look into that . ”
93829	93835	93836	93836	she	158	“ I should get Smuckers , ”
93842	93850	93836	93836	she	158	“ I really , really so should . ”

94115	94159	94052	94052	I	0	“ We did n’t even need him . I just got off the phone with Malcomb . Her lawyer contacted him about terminology questions for papers for signing off ownership for a dollar . I underestimated the powers of the Henry Locke dick . ”
94160	94167	94022	94022	they	2402	“ What are you talking about ? ”
94168	94238	94239	94239	My	0	“ The company . She ’s giving it back . For a dollar . And you ’ll be happy to know that I smoothed everything over with Denny . We own a parcel of land up north that the Woodruffs want for something . Small price to pay for keeping him quiet about a dog and Vonda O’Neil on our board because please , that would be a disaster . ”
94252	94271	94243	94243	She	2403	“ You deserve an Academy Award , brother . We do n’t even need the competency hearing now . ”

94296	94300	94289	94289	He	2404	“ Competency hearing ? ”
94332	94340	94328	94328	Her	2403	“ Competency hearing ? Operation good cop ? ”
94341	94349	94350	94350	I	0	“ It ’s not what you think . ”

94486	94497	94498	94498	She	2403	“ But it ’s still on . As of now . ”
94503	94514	94498	94498	She	2403	“ Is it still on ? As of this moment ? ”

94533	94548	94498	94498	She	2403	“ Please , just say . Is it still on ? As of now ? ”
94549	94558	94498	94498	She	2403	“ Yes . Technically it ’s still on . ”
94559	94562	94563	94563	She	2403	“ Technically . ”
94566	94582	94563	94563	She	2403	“ And all this time , were you guys gathering evidence ? To destroy me ? ”
94596	94621	94589	94589	I	0	“ Awesome performance . I guess that ’s one thing Brett and I can agree on . It was absolutely award winning . Bravo . ”

94799	94839	94761	94761	He	127	“ I did n’t get the half mill the last time around . So you ’ll pay it to me , and if you do n’t , the world will learn that Vonda O’Neil and Smuckers run your company . ”

94907	94912	94913	94913	Brett	127	“ We ’ll pay ! ”
94916	94925	94926	94926	I	0	“ I do n’t want you to go , ”
