748	777	745	745	I	0	“ As you all know , we ’ve been focusing on revamping the brand . Can anybody tell me what I ’m looking for in the new design ? ”
798	812	813	813	I	0	“ Talk to me , Ellie , seeing as no one else will . ”
866	881	882	882	she	108	“ The app ’s color scheme is fundamental to grasping the audience we want , ”
892	941	882	882	she	108	“ Cupid ’s Arrow is first and foremost a dating app for young people . It ’s possible they could be put off by the dark colors used on the home page and the messenger . What we need is a burst of color to attract the eye . ”
942	955	956	956	I	0	“ Yes , Ellie . Thank God somebody ’s listening to me , ”
967	986	956	956	I	0	“ So , with that in mind , what has everyone come up with ? Let me see . ”

1067	1107	1108	1108	Tim	42	“ Tim , this is good ... except the primary colors only appeal to children . This is a dating app . We do n’t really want seven - year - olds to start dating yet , do we ? ”

1406	1455	1456	1456	Everyone	1154	“ Let ’s take Ellie ’s and my designs as a starting point and fine - tune the color scheme . Each of you will choose three by the end of the day so that we can whittle it down to a final idea . Is that clear ? ”

2329	2340	2324	2324	he	43	“ is Cupid Arrow ’s secret weapon , Alexandra Croft . ”
2364	2379	2380	2380	he	144	“ A black sheep and a secret weapon . Sounds like a dangerous combination , ”
2389	2394	2395	2395	I	0	“ Both easily underestimated , ”

2601	2613	2596	2596	Alastair	43	“ Ben , we ’ll see you down in Tech later . ”
2614	2619	2620	2620	Ben	39	“ Yes , sir , ”
2754	2759	2742	2742	his	43	“ Have a seat . ”
2861	2886	2851	2851	he	43	“ There ’s nothing to worry about , Alexandra . You know how much I value your contributions . Now please , sit down . ”
2925	2972	2913	2913	his	43	“ This is hard for me to say . We ’ve been colleagues for some time now , and you ’re one of my top employees . That ’s why I ’m letting you know before the rest of the team — I’m leaving , Alex . ”
2973	2979	2980	2980	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
2993	3007	2990	2990	Alastair	43	“ I thought you ’d be pleased to see the back of me . ”
3008	3013	3014	3014	I	0	“ Of course not ! ”
3027	3039	3040	3040	Alastair	43	“ I ’m messing with you , Alex . Just teasing . ”
3058	3085	3051	3051	John	47	“ I do n’t know why you ’re so surprised . We all have to retire at some point . Even workaholics like you , eventually . ”
3086	3096	3111	3111	his	43	“ Well , yes . But you ’re still ... ”
3097	3100	3101	3101	Alastair	43	“ Young ? ”
3114	3146	3106	3106	He	43	“ One of the things I love most about you is that you ’re so funny without meaning to be . Are you telling me you did n’t see this coming ? ”
3147	3161	3162	3162	Alastair	43	“ Of course not . You did n’t exactly give us any warning . ”
3168	3202	3164	3164	his	43	“ Well . I ’m telling you now . In fact , you ’re the first person to find out . I ’m announcing my retirement officially at the end of the week . ”
3308	3317	3318	3318	I	0	“ So what does this mean for us ? ”
3321	3329	3318	3318	I	0	“ And why are you telling me ? ”
3330	3348	3357	3357	him	43	“ I ’ll get to that in a moment . I actually have a favor to ask . ”
3349	3354	3355	3355	I	0	“ Anything you want , ”
3398	3507	3508	3508	My	0	“ I ’m telling you first because you are responsible . I know you carry a lot of the workload , possibly more than me . I ’m not embarrassed to say that I ’ve had very little involvement in this company , because I ’m lazy . It ’s true , you ca n’t deny it . A bit of a womanizer , too . I started this business trying to bring dating into the information age . I never thought it would be the success it is now , top three in the field . It ’s a lot in part thanks to you , Alex . ”
3514	3565	3508	3508	My	0	“ That ’s okay . You ’ve been a great boss . Two marriages , two divorces , two sons to look after , plus ... well , you ’re charismatic . We ca n’t deny your presence is required at every red carpet event ever thrown in this city . ”
3582	3639	3575	3575	his	43	“ True , true . Well , I admit I ’ve grown — my character has matured — along with this business . And I ’ve always seen you as my little protégée I think you could help run this joint someday . But of course , there ’s someone else set to inherit by default . ”
3681	3691	3692	3692	he	43	“ William ’s got his own empire to run , ”
3701	3730	3692	3692	he	43	“ And Kit ... he was in Thailand for a while . But it ’s time he learned the meaning of hard work . Or at least work . ”
3735	3777	3731	3731	He	43	“ Kit has absolutely zero experience , but I do n’t see that as an issue , to be honest . When you came to me you were inexperienced as well , and look how far you ’ve come ? Kit ... ”
3788	3851	3778	3778	He	43	“ The issue lies in his personality . He ’s not cut out for company life as of yet . Kit ’s just like his old dad at his age — lazy , unfocused , immature . It runs in our blood , I ’m afraid . And his mother did n’t do much to improve our bloodline , I might add . ”
3894	3939	3942	3942	he	36	“ But the thing is , Kit ’s still young . He ’s not set in his ways like me . I think with some guidance , he could be good at this whole thing . He seems keen on taking over , anyway . ”
3975	3985	3986	3987	my boss	170	“ He ’s smart as a whip , Alex , ”
3998	4051	3986	3987	my boss	170	“ He ’s cool as a cucumber , too . He could excel here . I ’m determined that he ’ll be of some use . I could n’t bear it if he turned out to be a failure and brought shame to the family name . He has so much potential . ”
4108	4126	4127	4127	I	0	“ So what can I do to help you feel more at ease with this ... transition ? ”
4134	4209	4131	4131	Alastair	43	“ Straight down to business as always . Well , in truth , Kit could use a mentor , but he would never accept that . He does n’t like to be told what to do . While he gets settled , I ’m still going to flit in and out to keep an eye on him . But I ca n’t be around all the time . I want you to guide him . ”
4244	4268	4269	4269	He	170	“ Why so silent now , Alex ? My little prodigy , always with something to say , has no words for me ? ”
4274	4287	4271	4271	his	170	“ Remember , you just promised you ’d do anything for me . ”
4297	4310	4288	4288	I	0	“ I shot myself in the foot there , did n’t I ? ”
4311	4317	4318	4318	He	170	“ I suppose you did . ”
4693	4704	4705	4705	I	0	“ Well , what do you want me to do ? ”
4717	4756	4705	4705	I	0	“ Just be a guide to him . Once he trusts you , he might see how hard you work and want to follow in your footsteps . Watch him , teach him and ... report to me . ”
4757	4768	4838	4838	I	0	“ What is it that you want me to report ? ”
4769	4821	4822	4822	I	0	“ How he ’s doing . His inheritance will hang in the balance . I want to be sure my boy is deserving of it . And I ’m hoping , to be honest , that with you as inspiration he will be even more adept at this than I am . ”
4871	4886	4887	4887	I	0	“ And if my report is not ... what you hoped it would be ? ”
4890	4905	4887	4887	I	0	“ Then you help him change that . For the good of the company . ”
4917	4924	4914	4914	Alastair	43	“ Let me call him in . ”
4925	4930	4887	4887	I	0	“ Alastair , wait — ”
4969	4980	4966	4966	his	43	“ John , call my son in , will you ? ”
5048	5064	5041	5041	Alastair	43	“ Come in , Kit . Alex and I were just discussing you and Thailand . ”
5079	5085	5086	5086	he	36	“ Of course you were , ”
5101	5106	5107	5107	he	36	“ So , Alex , ”
5124	5132	5107	5107	he	36	“ you ever been out of Chicago ? ”
5133	5143	5144	5144	I	0	“ I go by Alexandra . Or Ms. Croft , ”
5166	5173	5174	5174	he	36	“ Ah well . Miss Croft , ”
5184	5202	5174	5174	he	36	“ Any other instructions for me before I take charge here behind this ... very ... desk ? ”
5320	5349	5317	5317	I	0	“ Only that your father has always trusted me to do what ’s best for my team — I expect the same courtesy from you , Mr. Walker . ”
5350	5358	5359	5359	His	43	“ Oh . I go by Kit . ”
5366	5387	5359	5359	His	43	“ And I ’ll do my best to grant you as much freedom as my father does , Miss Croft . ”
5506	5531	5503	5503	my	0	“ Well then , I ’ll be ready . Now , am I excused ? Some of us need to get back to work . ”
5586	5594	5595	5595	Angela	52	“ Is he not the most gorgeous — ”
5616	5622	5623	5623	I	0	“ Get back to work , ”
5722	5735	5736	5736	Ellie	40	“ I still ca n’t believe how gorgeous Alastair ’s youngest is , ”
5739	5754	5736	5736	Ellie	40	“ I ca n’t believe Alastair asked you to help teach him the ropes . ”
5765	5803	5763	5763	her	40	“ Good genetics . Alastair is very good - looking , too . He has two sons from different marriages and a string of affairs to attest to how those Walker men are candy to the ladies . ”
5882	5922	5877	5877	Kit	36	“ I ’m sort of dreading this whole thing , Ellie . I mean ... Why does Alastair think I have the ability to change some playboy into a model boss and entrepreneur ? It ’s ludicrous , really . ”
5923	5945	5946	5946	Ellie	40	“ But you did notice the way you two sort of lit up the whole room when you saw each other ? ”
6065	6075	6076	6076	I	0	“ No , I wo n’t admit to that , ”
6089	6110	6076	6076	I	0	“ In fact , I think you ’re seeing things , and I blame your new low - carb diet . ”
6127	6136	6137	6137	I	0	“ Okay , I ’m ready . You ? ”
6158	6198	6149	6149	Ellie	40	“ I ’m ready . But are we seriously not going to talk about this ? Alex , we ’ve been friends for ages . Even before Cupid ’s Arrow . We grew up together . I know you . ”
6199	6239	6240	6240	I	0	“ Okay , fine . I have n’t been on a date in two years and I suppose I was struck by the man ’s utter beauty and his gorgeous — we ca n’t deny it — British accent , ”
6250	6275	6276	6276	Ellie	40	“ That speaks volumes about me , do n’t you think ? That some stranger can just throw me off the way he did ? ”
6279	6297	6276	6276	Ellie	40	“ It speaks volumes that you need to get laid . Even workaholics need a little playtime . ”
6298	6323	6324	6324	I	0	“ Not this one . And especially not with him . God , he was such an ass in Alastair ’s office , Ellie ! ”
6345	6366	6324	6324	I	0	“ I suppose if a decent man asked me on a date , maybe I ’d go out with him . ”
6405	6409	6410	6410	I	0	“ Like who ? ”
6413	6419	6410	6410	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
6434	6452	6420	6420	Ellie	40	“ Yeah , well . I do . Alastair ’s son . You would totally date him . ”
6453	6532	6533	6533	Ellie	40	“ No , I should n’t . Alastair once told me his eldest son , William , is like his first wife , who was very responsible and divorced Alastair because he was such a mess in his younger years . But if Kit is anything like his father when he was younger or that stripper second wife he married , I would n’t touch him with a ten - foot pole . Players are n’t my thing . ”
6544	6580	6541	6541	I	0	“ I just like guys that are n’t complete assholes , Ellie . Like that one boyfriend who was so easygoing . Maybe too easygoing to the point maybe I thought he did n’t care ? ”
6596	6615	6581	6581	I	0	“ I know what you ’re thinking . But I ’m not picky . I just have standards . ”
6632	6647	6648	6648	she	40	“ I have standards , too , but I occasionally date , you know ? ”
6657	6675	6648	6648	she	40	“ It ’s not a bad thing to recognize that you ’re a woman and have needs . ”
6688	6713	6676	6676	I	0	“ Stop it . I need to be professional tonight and I ca n’t be moping around about my datelessness these past two years . ”
6798	6810	6811	6811	I	0	“ Are you going to pull out of the parking spot ? ”
6840	6852	6853	6853	Ellie	40	“ Wow . Alex Croft , completely dazed by a guy . ”
6879	6902	6872	6872	I	0	“ This has nothing to do with a guy . We barely exchanged words . It ’s just that tonight is important . ”
6903	6920	6933	6933	she	40	“ I ’ve never seen you so flustered . Do you want to talk about it ? ”
6921	6924	6925	6925	I	0	“ No , ”
6939	6986	6936	6936	her	40	“ You know I ’m nervous about this whole deal . Me babysitting that ... player . I ’m nervous that after Alastair gives his goodbye speech later tonight , there ’ll be no turning back and we ’ll all have Kit Walker as a boss . ”
6991	7012	6987	6987	Ellie	40	“ Another reason to wake up with a smile in the morning . Just to see him in the office — ”
7013	7016	7017	7017	I	0	“ Ellie ! ”
7068	7091	7063	7063	Ellie	40	“ Speaking of possible dates ... look who ’s here just in time . Methinks some guy at the office likes you . ”
7106	7115	7116	7116	He	39	“ Hey , Alex . You look great . ”
7123	7131	7116	7116	He	39	“ I — ah , thanks Ben . ”
7132	7149	7116	7116	He	39	“ No , really , you do . You sound like you do n’t believe me . ”
7150	7160	7116	7116	He	39	“ I , uh , no , I ’m ... ”
7161	7170	7171	7171	He	39	“ Ben , she knows she looks hot . ”
7233	7237	7238	7238	he	39	“ Okay then , ”
7327	7343	7344	7344	Ben	39	“ Alastair knows how to get the best vibe . I ’ll miss his parties , ”
7434	7444	7445	7445	I	0	“ Where ’s Kit ? Have you seen him ? ”
7463	7482	7449	7449	He	39	“ Who cares ? I ’m sure you ’ll see him later . We should be having fun . ”
7483	7498	7513	7513	He	39	“ It ’s a staff party . It ’s not meant to be fun . ”
7499	7508	7509	7509	Ben	39	“ Everyone else is having a good time , ”
7543	7553	7540	7540	I	0	“ I ca n’t cut loose . Not tonight . ”
7554	7558	7559	7559	Ben	39	“ Suit yourself , ”
7567	7574	7575	7575	He	39	“ Are you coming with me ? ”
7586	7593	7575	7575	He	39	“ I ’ll wait here awhile . ”
7689	7723	7884	7884	I	0	“ ... hope you act responsible for once like your brother . I ’m asking Alexandra to take you on and report to me as you learn the ropes and that ’s that . ”
7724	7747	7884	7884	I	0	“ I do n’t need to be taken on by your favorite pet . I know a thing or two about business . ”
7748	7766	7884	7884	I	0	“ Right . Dropping out of college to travel around the world taught you all the ropes ? ”
7767	7793	7884	7884	I	0	“ Gut instinct . Believe me , Pops , you can learn things out in the streets that you ca n’t learn in a classroom . ”
7794	7817	7884	7884	I	0	“ Well all I know is this is the only chance you ’re getting , Kit . Your brother already has a — ”
7818	7844	7884	7884	I	0	“ I know William made it big on his own . I never asked for this company . You want me here . Face it . ”
7845	7856	7884	7884	I	0	“ True . So show me I was n’t wrong . ”
7857	7883	7884	7884	I	0	“ You ’re not wrong , but I appreciate you letting me bring my own cards to the table and not stepping on my toes . ”
8157	8201	8125	8125	Alastair	43	“ Good evening , everyone . Welcome to my retirement party . I know you ’re all thrilled to see me go , and I see some of you are already celebrating so much you wo n’t remember this whole evening even happened . ”
8244	8254	8255	8255	Alastair	43	“ Now before I get far too drunk myself — ”
8262	8274	8255	8255	Alastair	43	“ — I ’d like to say some thank - yous . ”
8298	8311	8312	8312	Alastair	43	“ Thanks to my trusted friend and finance manager , Erin Gough , ”
8316	8373	8374	8374	He	43	“ To Ben , on the technical side of things . We ’d trip up without you , Benny ! And I ’d especially like to thank my design team . For an app like Cupid ’s Arrow , you need a vision , and my most faithful employee helped me bring my idea to life . ”
8395	8415	8385	8385	his	43	“ Thank you endlessly , Alexandra Croft , for working far too hard to make my dream a reality . ”
8515	8581	8509	8509	me	0	“ Now , despite my retirement , I do plan to pop in from time to time to observe how my company is doing . There will , of course , be new management , and it ’s my great honor to introduce my successor tonight . I hope that he can do me proud as we enter a new era at Cupid ’s Arrow . ”
8590	8608	8587	8587	he	286	“ Please give a warm welcome to my pride and joy , my son , Kit Walker ! ”
8821	8836	8837	8837	Kit	36	“ When I told my father I was ready to get down to business , ”
8841	8849	8837	8837	Kit	36	“ he asked me , what business ? ”
8854	8890	8891	8891	He	36	“ Because you see , Cupid ’s Arrow is more like love than work to my father . This company has always been more like his family . It ’s enough to make me jealous . ”
9003	9017	9018	9022	one of the rowdier men	298	“ Are you impressed by your team at Cupid ’s Arrow , Kit ? ”
9026	9048	9049	9049	Kit	36	“ Well , I have to say , I ca n’t wait to work with such a beautiful bunch of people , ”
9148	9190	9191	9191	He	36	“ I must admit , inheriting Cupid ’s Arrow represents a lot of firsts for me . And , well ... the first time I rode a bike , I got a scar to prove it . I may make mistakes ... ”
9231	9295	9227	9227	he	36	“ In fact , most assuredly I will make mistakes , but at the end of the day , I plan to get it right . I will bring Cupid ’s Arrow into the new era with better service , a catchier design , a better slogan ... Everyone into online dating and even those who are n’t will be using our app . ”
9436	9447	9448	9448	he	39	“ He seems to look forward to working with you , ”
9465	9472	9473	9473	I	0	“ I need a little air , ”
9484	9492	9481	9481	I	0	“ Leaving so soon , Miss Croft ? ”
9552	9561	9562	9562	he	36	“ The party ’s only just getting started , ”
9568	9573	9562	9562	he	36	“ Stay and play . ”
9696	9699	9700	9700	he	36	“ Everyone , ”
9711	9731	9704	9704	his	36	“ It ’s the woman of the hour , Alexandra Croft . I ’ve heard a lot about you . ”
9826	9836	9837	9837	he	36	“ I hope you enjoy this party , Alex , ”
9847	9871	9837	9837	he	36	“ And I look forward to working with you as I ... learn the ropes . Three cheers for Ms. Croft , everyone . ”
9917	9938	9900	9900	He	36	“ I think you ’ve heard enough from me for now , folks . Let ’s get wasted , yeah ? ”
10154	10161	10150	10150	I	0	“ Alastair , can we talk ? ”
10179	10188	10162	10162	Alastair	43	“ Are n’t you having a good time ? ”
10189	10224	10225	10225	I	0	“ In all honesty ? No , I ’m not . I’m ... concerned about this whole thing . Does your son know that I ’m supposed to report his ... progress to you ? ”
10258	10299	10300	10300	He	43	“ Of course , Alex . He ’s my boy , he needs to know that I ’m going to be watching his every move . Why ? You ’re not going to quit on me now , are you ? ”
10310	10317	10300	10300	He	43	“ I am not a quitter , ”
10321	10337	10338	10338	Alastair	43	“ But I also feel uncomfortable being put up against my new boss like that . ”
10343	10394	10338	10338	Alastair	43	“ Of course you do , Alex . But do n’t look at it that way . That ’s the mistake he ’s making , too . You ’re on the same team . Why do you think I asked you to get involved ? You can help that boy . ”
10402	10424	10395	10395	I	0	“ No . I really do n’t know that I can help him at all or that he wants my help . ”
10425	10437	10438	10438	Alastair	43	“ Ah . You ’re just backing away from a challenge . ”
10445	10456	10438	10438	Alastair	43	“ I thought you were better than that , Alex . ”
10457	10497	10498	10498	I	0	“ Alastair , I ’m not sure this is something I can do . I do n’t know if I can work with someone who may not take work as seriously as I do and I ’m not sure ... ”
10588	10628	10582	10582	he	43	“ If you need a breather , go up to the suite I ’ve rented and think this over . You ’ll have the place to yourself . I know you ’ll feel differently in an hour or so . ”
10629	10641	10642	10642	I	0	“ I wo n’t . Please ask someone else , Alastair , ”
10645	10655	10656	10656	Alastair	43	“ Your stubbornness will be your downfall , Alex . ”
10678	10730	10731	10731	Alastair	43	“ Do you think I wanted to see my youngest son turn out like this ? I ’m asking you to help me . As an old friend . If you do n’t think you can do that , then I guess you ’re not the person I thought you were . ”
11753	11762	11746	11746	Kit	36	“ Having a good evening , Miss Croft ? ”
11763	11777	11778	11778	Kit	36	“ It certainly looks like you ’re getting to the good parts quickly . ”
11789	11794	11783	11783	his	36	“ Do you smoke ? ”
11795	11799	11746	11746	Kit	36	“ Absolutely not . ”
11813	11831	11804	11804	Kit	36	“ Cool . I keep them around to offer people . It seems polite , you know ? ”
11874	11886	11887	11887	I	0	“ What , so giving people lung cancer is polite now ? ”
11906	11912	11897	11897	He	36	“ Did you need something ? ”
11913	11922	11897	11897	He	36	“ I came outside for some fresh air . ”
12006	12021	12022	12022	he	36	“ Do you really think you can keep me in line , Miss Croft ? ”
12056	12072	12031	12031	he	36	“ It ’s not my fault your father wants to keep an eye on you . ”
12073	12087	12088	12088	he	36	“ I ’ve never held an actual job before . That concerns him , ”
12102	12118	12088	12088	he	36	“ But the way my dad described you , I just thought you ’d be ... ”
12124	12127	12119	12119	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
12128	12133	12157	12157	his	36	“ Well , different . ”
12134	12138	12157	12157	his	36	“ Different how ? ”
12139	12147	12148	12148	He	36	“ I thought you ’d be boring . ”
12160	12184	12148	12148	He	36	“ But you ’re not . In fact , I think the words to describe you would be interesting , amusing . Stunning . ”
12219	12226	12227	12227	I	0	“ We barely know each other , ”
12235	12250	12231	12231	Kit	36	“ Oh , I ’m sorry . Did I offend you with my compliment ? ”
12251	12263	12264	12264	He	36	“ I ’d say it ’s a backhanded compliment , actually . ”
12269	12280	12266	12266	his	36	“ Well , I never intended to hurt your feelings . ”
12286	12305	12281	12281	I	0	“ You ’ve got a lot to learn . You should n’t speak to your colleagues like that . ”
12306	12310	12311	12311	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
12315	12358	12311	12311	I	0	“ Like they ’re all your playthings . Do n’t call me stunning and think I do n’t know what you ’re doing . It might work on that girl you were just ... just ... flirting with , but not me . ”
12359	12370	12371	12371	Kit	36	“ She ’s having more fun tonight than you are , ”
12390	12395	12376	12376	he	36	“ You ’re infuriating . ”
12401	12423	12396	12396	Kit	36	“ Not to everyone . I just know how to wind you up . I can read you like a book . ”
12435	12441	12424	12424	I	0	“ Look , Mr. Walker ... ”
12442	12445	12446	12446	he	36	“ Kit , ”
12449	12452	12453	12453	I	0	“ Kit . ”
12515	12520	12521	12521	I	0	“ Look , Kit , ”
12536	12627	12521	12521	I	0	“ We do n’t have to be friends , I just have to be civil . I do n’t like that I ’m reporting on you to your father but he ’s asked me to , and because he ’s been so good to me and is still the owner , I agreed . It ’s nothing personal against you . He said I should n’t look at you as an enemy and that we should — work together , to make this transition go smoothly . Is that clear ? ”
12652	12667	12668	12668	he	36	“ Crystal clear , Ms. Croft . I look forward to learning the ropes , ”
12671	12682	12668	12668	he	36	“ Nothing would give me more pleasure than teaching you , ”
12967	12976	12977	12977	Ellie	40	“ I heard people talking about last night , ”
13001	13013	12977	12977	Ellie	40	“ Something about Kit and a woman in the parking lot . ”
13014	13031	13032	13032	I	0	“ They were n’t doing anything but talking , even though she obviously hoped for more , ”
13045	13067	13036	13036	She	40	“ Oh really ? Well people think it was you and him , actually . They saw you two talking outside . ”
13156	13183	13184	13184	I	0	“ That was n’t me . And if whoever is saying that wants to keep his or her job , I suggest they stop spreading slander , ”
13234	13238	13239	13239	Angela	52	“ I just — ”
13242	13316	13239	13239	Angela	52	“ I do n’t care how fun it is to gossip about the new boss . If I hear anyone disrespecting him like that again , you ’ll have me to answer to . You would never speak that way about Alastair , and Kit deserves the same respect . Anyone who feels differently will be having a very serious conversation with me about their place in this company . Is that clear ? ”
13384	13432	13433	13437	The members of my team	402	“ Am I the only one around here interested in the fact that our app design needs to be finalized by next Friday ? That ’s just a week , and the new boss is coming in today expecting to see what we ’ve got so far . ”
13495	13568	13569	13569	I	0	“ All right , this is n’t good enough . None of you are fit to be here . I wo n’t allow my team to show up in a state like this . I want you all to go home . Now . I ’ll see you on Monday morning for a much - needed regroup . Get some rest , hydrate . And bring me your absolute best on Monday . ”
13699	13707	13708	13708	I	0	“ And what exactly happened to you ? ”
13736	13739	13740	13740	he	39	“ Nothing , ”
13745	13751	13752	13752	He	39	“ Come on . Spill . ”
13756	13765	13752	13752	He	39	“ I fell over challenging Tim to handstands . ”
13766	13772	13773	13773	Tim	42	“ Do n’t blame me ! ”
13791	13798	13776	13776	he	42	“ You brought that on yourself . ”
13799	13820	13821	13821	I	0	“ Well , I still expect that you ’ll be in top form Monday , Tim . Concussion or not , ”
13825	13835	13821	13821	I	0	“ And you , Ben ? You know better . ”
13836	13843	13844	13844	Ben	39	“ It ’s not that bad ... ”
13857	13871	13872	13872	Ben	39	“ But you ’re right . There ’s no excuse for unproductive behavior . ”
13877	13912	13872	13872	Ben	39	“ I ca n’t leave for the day since I have my own team to manage , but now that you have some peace and quiet , I hope you have a good one . ”
13913	13917	13918	13918	I	0	“ You too . ”
13933	13943	13926	13926	Ellie	40	“ Thank you , you ’re the best boss . ”
13947	13967	13944	13944	I	0	“ Get out of here , Ellie , and please do n’t put me on the spot on Monday . ”
13968	13975	13976	13976	She	40	“ I wo n’t ! Promise ! ”
14337	14344	14330	14330	I	0	“ Good afternoon , Ms. Croft . ”
14345	14348	14349	14349	I	0	“ Hi , ”
14392	14411	14381	14381	Kit	36	“ Well , its not as lively as I expected ... where ’s the rest of your team ? ”
14412	14415	14416	14416	I	0	“ I ... ”
14438	14447	14448	14448	Kit	36	“ I sent them home for the day . ”
14488	14497	14485	14485	his	36	“ And why did you send them home ? ”
14498	14517	14485	14485	his	36	“ They were n’t in any fit state to work , and I gave them time to regroup . ”
14518	14529	14530	14530	I	0	“ You ca n’t just send employees home , Alexandra . ”
14543	14549	14533	14533	Alastair	43	“ I — I did . ”
14550	14556	14557	14557	I	0	“ That ’s my job . ”
14575	14590	14591	14591	Kit	36	“ Your father taught me that I control my team . He never interfered — ”
14594	14605	14591	14591	Kit	36	“ Huh . That ’s what my father told you ? ”
14606	14614	14615	14615	Kit	36	“ That ’s what he taught me . ”
14636	14657	14627	14627	I	0	“ Well , my father is n’t here now . I ’m in charge . Bring them all back in . ”
14662	14707	14627	14627	I	0	“ Work finishes in two hours . I ’m not going to drag them all in from different parts of the city . They ’re useless today anyway . They let me down and I do n’t want us to turn in something sloppy . ”
14708	14722	14723	14723	I	0	“ I ’ll decide if they ’re useless . Get them in here . ”
14753	14770	14739	14739	His	36	“ Did you not hear me , or are you simply playing deaf , Ms. Croft ? ”
14776	14807	14739	14739	His	36	“ I made a call on what to do and though you may not like it , I need to stick by it . This is my team and usually — ”
14808	14823	14893	14893	his	36	“ Your team works for me . In my office , in my building . ”
14824	14840	14841	14841	I	0	“ I ’m sorry if you do n’t like the way I run my team . ”
14844	14880	14841	14841	I	0	“ Tell your father if you want , but I did what I thought was best . I apologize for the inconvenience to you , but they ’ll be back top - notch on Monday . ”
14920	14930	14931	14931	His	36	“ You ’re walking a dangerous line , Alexandra . ”
15036	15071	15072	15072	Kit	36	“ There are a lot of things that my father taught you that wo n’t apply in the future . Do n’t think because you ’re his favorite you have any leverage with me , ”
15120	15131	15132	15132	I	0	“ I suppose we got off to a bad start . ”
15139	15152	15153	15153	he	36	“ Keep pushing me , and you ’ll get to see bad , ”
15256	15271	15272	15272	I	0	“ Congratulations , Alex , you ’ve brought out my son ’s managerial qualities . ”
15275	15289	15272	15272	I	0	“ I did n’t mean to . I feel really bad about it . ”
15290	15303	15304	15304	he	43	“ Well I could n’t be more pleased . Report back soon , ”
15757	15762	15749	15749	Tim	42	“ Morning , Alexandra . ”
15763	15768	15769	15769	I	0	“ Morning , Tim , ”
15772	15805	15769	15769	I	0	“ It ’s good to see you all in early and in top form . Glad you ’re back with a better attitude , and I intend to have one , too . ”
15806	15812	15813	15813	I	0	“ Nice speech , boss . ”
15835	15868	15821	15821	She	40	“ All right , everyone . The boss will be coming in later to look over the final three designs . Let ’s blow him out of the water , shall we ? ”
16052	16055	16056	16056	Kit	36	“ Yeah ? ”
16063	16084	16085	16085	I	0	“ Is that how you greet your father ’s favorite and soon - to - be your favorite as well ? ”
16088	16113	16085	16085	I	0	“ It ’s how I plan to answer when you show up on the caller ID , Ms. Croft . How can I help ? ”
16126	16148	16114	16114	I	0	“ You were meant to come and see our designs and make a decision on the final look for the app . ”
16149	16188	16189	16189	I	0	“ Was I ? Oh , so your team is back to work ? Are we certain we do n’t want them to take a few more days , just to be sure they ’re ready and recharged ? ”
16227	16245	16218	16218	him	443	“ We ’re ready , sir . Whenever you ’re ready , we ’ve prepared a presentation . ”
16246	16254	16255	16255	Kit	36	“ Well that should be just riveting , ”
16264	16273	16255	16255	Kit	36	“ I ’ll be down in two minutes . ”
16327	16336	16337	16337	I	0	“ Mr. Walker will be with us shortly , ”
16341	16354	16337	16337	I	0	“ Let ’s be ready to do the presentation in twenty minutes . ”
16506	16526	16500	16500	He	36	“ Right . Let ’s get on with it , shall we ? What do you have for me ? ”
16594	16606	16575	16575	Tim	42	“ We ’ve narrowed it down to three designs , sir . ”
16745	16750	16751	16751	He	36	“ Who designed these ? ”
16779	16792	16793	16793	I	0	“ Ellie , Angela and I came out with the top designs , ”
16797	16813	16793	16793	I	0	“ If you look up at the wall screen , the colors are more noticeable — ”
16839	16855	16856	16856	Kit	36	“ Well , I expect better from the ‘ best ’ design team in Chicago , ”
16868	16872	16856	16856	Kit	36	“ Excuse me ? ”
16873	16894	16895	16895	Kit	36	“ You ’re excused . For now . But I expect better , Ms. Croft . From all of you , ”
16904	16913	16895	16895	Kit	36	“ There ’s nothing wrong with these designs . ”
16914	16923	16856	16856	Kit	36	“ There ’s plenty wrong with the designs . ”
16924	16928	16856	16856	Kit	36	“ Such as ? ”
16929	16970	16971	16971	Angela	52	“ Well , where ’s the sex appeal ? All these colors are stripped back and muted . If this is all you have , we might as well stick with the old design . At least it ’s erotic . ”
17011	17056	17006	17006	I	0	“ If you read the brief your father sent , you would know that we ’re trying to move away from that type of design . A lot of our users are younger adults , and we need to make it more accessible to — ”
17057	17099	17100	17100	Kit	36	“ Right , that ’s all well and good , Ms. Croft , but I ’m in charge now . I ’m telling you , these designs are boring . They wo n’t sell . I want you to start over . ”
17228	17255	17256	17256	Kit	36	“ You do n’t understand what you ’re saying . My team worked hard on this . You ca n’t just discard everything we worked on . ”
17353	17360	17361	17361	he	36	“ Not . Good . Enough , ”
17382	17412	17374	17374	His	36	“ My father expects me to bring it , Ms. Croft . And I ... I expect you to bring it , as well . Now , try again . ”
17659	17671	17672	17672	Ellie	40	“ Come on , Alex , it ’s not that bad , ”
17690	17716	17675	17675	I	0	“ I ’m in a terrible mood . I just ca n’t believe I have to abandon weeks ’ worth of work for that idiot . ”
17745	17767	17728	17728	I	0	“ Look , I know what happened , but you either need to do something about it or let it go . ”
17768	17776	17717	17717	I	0	“ What would you suggest I do ? ”
17777	17794	17795	17795	I	0	“ Report him to Alastair . No boss should get away with treating employees like that . ”
17805	17829	17795	17795	I	0	“ Yeah , well , I ’m not exactly employee of the year . Sometimes I ’m not a good boss , either . ”
17830	17837	17717	17717	I	0	“ You are , I swear . ”
17838	17877	17878	17878	I	0	“ Do n’t lie to me , Ellie . I pressure the team and nobody likes that . Now that Kit is pressuring me , I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of it . ”
17890	17925	17886	17886	Ellie	40	“ Stop feeling sorry for yourself . This is n’t like you . Plus , have you noticed Ben eyeing you ? I think he has a candle lit with your name on it . ”
17926	17929	17938	17938	she	40	“ What ? ”
17943	17959	17938	17938	she	40	“ Ben ? I would never ... Ben and I are friends . Just friends . ”
17970	17977	17978	17978	Ellie	40	“ I ’m worried about you , ”
17981	17991	17978	17978	Ellie	40	“ You have n’t been yourself since Kit arrived . ”
17992	18004	18005	18005	Ellie	40	“ Do n’t be worried . Just leave him to me . ”
18011	18046	18005	18005	Ellie	40	“ Look , Alex , you ’re the best . The best at Cupid ’s Arrow . Hell , you ’re the best anywhere . Kit does n’t know what he ’s talking about . ”
18069	18072	18056	18056	someone	470	“ Thanks . ”
18073	18103	18125	18125	her	471	“ He might not believe in you , but I swear , I do . I do n’t care if he ’s the boss . His opinion is zilch . ”
18104	18121	18122	18122	I	0	“ You ’re the best , Ellie , really . Thank you for the pep talk . ”
18134	18148	18122	18122	I	0	“ What do you think Angela and the other girls see in him ? ”
18149	18152	18125	18125	her	471	“ Who ? ”
18153	18158	18159	18159	I	0	“ Kit , obviously , ”
18162	18176	18159	18159	I	0	“ They ’ve been all over him like a rash since he arrived . ”
18182	18225	18177	18177	She	471	“ Like we do n’t know ? He ’s got this certain something — this X factor . He ’s delicious . But of course , Angela is all over any guy like that . It ’s just the way she is . ”
18226	18286	18287	18287	Ellie	40	“ But everyone ’s talking about him . Even after what happened , I overhear them in the break room . They keep talking about all the girls he ’s hooked up with , or what color suit he ’s wearing . Angela seemed proud of herself when she discovered she drinks the same kind of coffee as him . ”
18305	18317	18318	18318	she	40	“ Wow . What a dumb thing to get excited over , ”
18321	18370	18318	18318	she	40	“ Well , exactly , that ’s what I thought . That ’s why I just do n’t get it . He ’s an asshole . Women do n’t actually like that , right ? I mean , there ’s really nothing to swoon over , is there ? ”
18371	18389	18390	18390	I	0	“ Now who ’s trying to brainwash herself into thinking she does n’t like the new boss ? ”
18393	18455	18390	18390	I	0	“ You told me about those rumors from the night of Alastair ’s retirement party . I do n’t want anything to ruin Cupid ’s Arrow for me . I suppose that ’s why I ’ve been so determined to almost hate Kit . A part of me wishes it was still Alastair in his place . Safe , nice Alastair . ”
18456	18482	18318	18318	she	40	“ Alastair wants the good life . He ’s worked so many years , he deserves it . He wo n’t come back , Alex . ”
18483	18487	18488	18488	I	0	“ I know . ”
18501	18555	18488	18488	I	0	“ I suppose all I can do is make the best out of my situation and try to get along with Kit . Yes , so he ’s got the women in a frenzy , but from now on , if being irresistible is his superpower , I ’m completely immune to it . ”
18697	18702	18703	18703	Kit	36	“ Can this wait ? ”
18725	18732	18733	18733	I	0	“ No , it ca n’t , ”
18871	18891	18892	18893	the woman	481	“ Thank you for your time , again , Kit , and say hello to your dad for me , ”
18909	18916	18896	18896	Kit	36	“ Come in , Miss Croft . ”
18960	18976	18946	18946	I	0	“ I ’m surprised that you’re ... getting into the groove of things so well . ”
19064	19073	19074	19074	Kit	36	“ How can I help you , Alex ? ”
19121	19144	19145	19145	I	0	“ I do n’t want anything in particular . But I do hope to find a way to work out our differences , ”
19183	19203	19175	19175	I	0	“ I thought we could maybe do lunch , or dinner , on a day you might be free ... ”
19213	19219	19220	19220	he	36	“ Assuming I ’m free , ”
19223	19231	19232	19232	I	0	“ So ? Make me a priority , ”
19237	19269	19232	19232	I	0	“ I am one of the most important employees you have on your payroll . I think we would do well to sit down together and get to know one another . ”
19270	19277	19278	19278	Kit	36	“ Why not do that here ? ”
19370	19440	19466	19466	his	492	“ I merely hoped to maybe find a place outside of work so we can both feel less stressed and more open with each other . But just so you ’re not mistaken , my intentions are purely business related . We ’ll be working closely together , and since you rejected my ideas for the app , I ’d like to hear your thoughts on some new designs . ”
19441	19445	19466	19466	his	492	“ About that — ”
19446	19452	19453	19453	I	0	“ I ’m over it , ”
19469	19498	19499	19499	Kit	36	“ I just want to talk in a less formal setting . Maybe outside of office hours . I think it will relieve some of the ... tension . ”
19510	19517	19507	19507	his	36	“ Is that what you want ? ”
19518	19528	19529	19529	I	0	“ I ’m sure you mean nothing by that , ”
19542	19552	19529	19529	I	0	“ But yes . That is what I want . ”
19553	19561	19507	19507	his	36	“ All right . Dinner it is . ”
19562	19575	19576	19576	I	0	“ Where would you like to meet ? Are you available tonight ? ”
19590	19614	19587	19587	Kit	36	“ Well , Ms. Croft . You might have asked earlier . Some people have plans on a Friday night , you know . ”
19621	19634	19587	19587	Kit	36	“ Oh . Well , I guess I can do any time . ”
19669	19680	19650	19650	his	36	“ Well , I guess I ’m free Monday evening . ”
19681	19696	19697	19697	I	0	“ No dates lined up for the start of the week ? How unusual , ”
19736	19743	19744	19744	he	36	“ Monday ’s a work night , ”
19748	19766	19744	19744	he	36	“ Friday ’s for parties . In fact , I ’m hosting one at my place tonight . ”
19767	19773	19774	19774	I	0	“ How interesting for you , ”
19805	19810	19811	19811	he	36	“ You should come , ”
19815	19819	19811	19811	he	36	“ No thanks , ”
19900	19910	19923	19923	Kit	36	“ Come on ... half your department is going . ”
19916	19922	19923	19923	Kit	36	“ They were already invited ? ”
19926	19939	19923	19923	Kit	36	“ Well , I did n’t think it would be your scene . ”
19981	19986	19987	19987	I	0	“ You thought right , ”
19995	20000	19987	19987	I	0	“ I ’ll pass . ”
20001	20004	20005	20005	Kit	36	“ Wait ! ”
20024	20040	20021	20021	his	36	“ I should have extended an invite earlier . I ’d like you to come . ”
20041	20045	20046	20046	I	0	“ Oh really ? ”
20054	20062	20046	20046	I	0	“ Because we ’re such good colleagues ? ”
20083	20094	20095	20095	Kit	36	“ Because we should make an effort to get along , ”
20099	20126	20095	20095	Kit	36	“ You got your dinner date . Indulge me by coming tonight . I ’m sure your co - workers will want you there , too . ”
20248	20265	20266	20266	I	0	“ All right . I ’ll see if I can fit it in my busy schedule , ”
20283	20297	20275	20275	Kit	36	“ Ah , yes , you have such a busy schedule this evening . ”
20308	20319	20275	20275	Kit	36	“ My commitment to Netflix is pretty important to me . ”
20320	20325	20326	20326	His	36	“ So it seems . ”
20430	20439	20422	20422	Kit	36	“ Alex . Can you wait a moment ? ”
20534	20567	20568	20568	Kit	36	“ I just wanted to say ... I ’m sorry for how I treated you the other day . I know it must have hurt you ... and I apologize for that , ”
20582	20592	20576	20576	I	0	“ Did your father put you up to this ? ”
20593	20607	20608	20608	Kit	36	“ No , I did n’t tell him . This is all me . ”
20706	20714	20715	20715	he	36	“ See you tonight , Ms. Croft , ”
20772	20785	20768	20768	his	36	“ Remind me again why I ’m being dragged shopping with you ? ”
20786	20810	20811	20811	Ellie	40	“ Because you ’re a good friend and I asked you to . Okay , begged you to . And I never beg . ”
21024	21033	21009	21009	I	0	“ What do you think of this one ? ”
21034	21041	21042	21042	Ellie	40	“ Hmm ... let me think ... ”
21065	21085	21056	21056	She	40	“ I think you ’ll look hot in it . Just like every single other dress you picked up . ”
21099	21106	21086	21086	I	0	“ I have to look spectacular . ”
21107	21113	21058	21058	her	40	“ For a work party ? ”
21114	21119	21058	21058	her	40	“ This is different . ”
21120	21140	21086	21086	I	0	“ Why ? Because your boss is n’t some old guy anymore ? Are you trying to impress him ? ”
21141	21144	21145	21145	I	0	“ Yes , ”
21155	21171	21145	21145	I	0	“ He ’s not like his dad . His dad had a little more class . ”
21172	21244	21086	21086	I	0	“ So you ’re just going to go against everything you believe in ? You ’re going to get drunk , wear a short dress just to impress a guy you do n’t even like , and then what ? Are you looking for a raise or ... ? Admit it . You want him on his back ... or you want to be on your back , on his desk ... ”
21245	21251	21252	21252	I	0	“ Do n’t be ridiculous ! ”
21316	21326	21327	21327	I	0	“ Look , I impressed Alastair in other ways , ”
21347	21365	21327	21327	I	0	“ I ’m not after Kit . I ’m just trying to appeal to his specific personality . ”
21366	21371	21372	21372	Ellie	40	“ Which is what ? ”
21375	21380	21372	21372	Ellie	40	“ An idiotic player ? ”
21397	21406	21394	21394	his	39	“ Ben ? What are you doing here ? ”
21425	21449	21411	21411	he	39	“ So ... you’re falling for him just like every other woman in the office ? I thought you were different , Alex . ”
21467	21476	21477	21477	Ellie	40	“ Hey , I thought you liked Kit ? ”
21481	21488	21489	21489	Ben	39	“ What gave you that impression ? ”
21507	21523	21496	21496	he	39	“ You were letting him lead you around like a puppy at the last party . ”
21524	21534	21535	21535	he	39	“ Maybe that ’s how I impress the boss , ”
21545	21561	21535	21535	he	39	“ See , we do n’t all have to buy slinky dresses to do that . ”
21583	21609	21610	21610	Ben	39	“ Well , sure . I do n’t feel like Kit would be impressed if you showed up in a dress , now would he ? ”
21620	21629	21617	21617	I	0	“ I ’m teasing , Ben . Relax . ”
21664	21688	21659	21659	He	521	“ All right . There ’s space for your boyfriend and friend to sit outside the changing rooms , if you ’d like ? ”
21704	21711	21693	21693	Ben	39	“ Oh , we ’re not ... ”
21712	21715	21716	21718	The store assistant	521	“ Apologies . ”
21721	21729	21716	21718	The store assistant	521	“ My mistake . Go on through . ”
21750	21753	21754	21754	Ben	39	“ Look , ”
21765	21783	21754	21754	Ben	39	“ I just want to know if you ’ve fallen for his charm like all the rest . ”
21784	21791	21792	21792	Ellie	40	“ Why would you think that ? ”
21795	21822	21792	21792	Ellie	40	“ Well , she ’s trying hard to impress him at some dumb party . He did n’t even invite her . She was an afterthought . ”
21862	21913	21846	21846	I	0	“ Look , this guy is my boss . Unless I quit and find another job , I have to try and be civil to him . You understand that , right ? I ’m not your boss but you have a team that sucks up to you , too . ”
21914	21919	21837	21837	he	39	“ That ’s different . ”
21920	21929	21846	21846	I	0	“ How is that any different at all ? ”
21930	21946	21846	21846	I	0	“ Well , we ’re friends . We all get along at Cupid ’s Arrow . ”
21947	21963	21964	21964	I	0	“ And if tonight goes well , Kit and I will be friends , too , ”
21974	21983	21964	21964	I	0	“ Or something that resembles friends , anyway . ”
21984	21993	21994	21994	Ben	39	“ I do n’t get you at all , ”
21997	22011	21994	21994	Ben	39	“ There ’s nothing to get . I ’m just doing my job . ”
22012	22020	22021	22021	I	0	“ Something changed . What was it ? ”
22101	22109	22097	22097	he	39	“ Alex ? Are you ignoring me ? ”
22110	22118	22119	22119	Ellie	40	“ Can you please just drop it ? ”
22133	22176	22122	22122	I	0	“ I ’m not interested in him in any way , shape or form . He ’s just my boss . I have to appeal to his better nature , if he actually has one . What ’s so hard to understand ? ”
22177	22194	22195	22195	Ben	39	“ All right , all right . No need to get touchy . Both of you , ”
22347	22354	22355	22355	I	0	“ What do you guys think ? ”
22385	22406	22379	22379	I	0	“ I ’ll get this one then . Shopping trip over . Thanks for the opinions , both of you . ”
22418	22421	22414	22414	himself	39	“ Finally ... ”
22422	22431	22432	22432	I	0	“ I ’ll see you at the party ? ”
22441	22445	22435	22435	Ben	39	“ See you . ”
22467	22476	22477	22477	Ellie	40	“ He definitely has his eye on you , ”
22480	22516	22477	22477	Ellie	40	“ You ’re determined to hook me up with someone , are n’t you ? I like Ben . We ’re good friends . But that ’s all that there could ever be between us . ”
22983	22986	22987	22987	I	0	“ Hey , ”
22993	22999	22987	22987	I	0	“ You wore the dress . ”
23003	23018	23000	23000	I	0	“ Obviously . I got it for the occasion . Shall we go in ? ”
23352	23363	23364	23364	I	0	“ Fine . So apparently , he can be funny , ”
23496	23514	23515	23515	he	36	“ If you ’ll excuse Miss Croft and me . We ’ve got some business to discuss , ”
23613	23624	23596	23596	He	36	“ Good evening , Miss Croft . You look stunning . ”
23651	23656	23657	23657	he	36	“ How are you ? ”
23660	23666	23667	23667	I	0	“ I ’ve been better , ”
23692	23703	23689	23689	Kit	36	“ Had a few glasses of bubbly , have we ? ”
23704	23714	23680	23680	I	0	“ One or two ... I could use another . ”
23715	23730	23680	23680	I	0	“ Are you sure about that ? You ’re not exactly a party animal . ”
23731	23742	23743	23743	I	0	“ Tonight , I ’m anything I want to be , ”
23771	23784	23766	23766	his	36	“ You sure ? You ’re already looking a bit ... hazy . ”
23785	23805	23806	23806	I	0	“ I ’m a grown adult , Kit . If I want to have a drink , I will , ”
23891	23894	23882	23882	I	0	“ Cheers . ”

24079	24088	24089	24089	Ben	39	“ He can wait , ca n’t he ? ”
24204	24213	24214	24214	he	39	“ As I thought . A damn tease , ”
24358	24365	24366	24366	he	39	“ You all right , Alex ? ”
24416	24421	24405	24405	I	0	“ I ’m fine . ”
24435	24442	24422	24422	I	0	“ Never been better . Boss . ”
24468	24474	24475	24475	I	0	“ Do n’t do that , ”
24484	24488	24478	24478	He	39	“ Do what ? ”
24498	24523	24489	24489	His	39	“ Look all sexy and possessive over me . I ’m having enough trouble keeping my mind straight around you without you complicating things . ”
24532	24538	24539	24539	he	39	“ Is that a fact ? ”
24547	24550	24539	24539	he	39	“ Fact ! ”
24575	24578	24582	24582	him	39	“ Ooops . ”

24612	24624	24598	24598	He	39	“ Why do n’t we sit you down , Ms. Croft ? ”
24722	24732	24733	24733	I	0	“ I work my ass off , you know , ”
24752	24758	24743	24743	Kit	36	“ Of course you do . ”
24759	24773	24774	24774	I	0	“ And then you walk in and you just trample all over me , ”
24796	24810	24828	24828	I	0	“ Is it possible you ’re taking this too personally , Miss Croft ? ”
24811	24822	24823	24823	I	0	“ Oh , I insure you , it is personal , ”
24841	24850	24834	24834	I	0	“ Assure , damn it , not insure . ”
24851	24861	24862	24862	Everyone	1154	“ I ’m sure everyone understood what you meant . ”
24895	24909	24910	24910	Kit	36	“ Come here , Alex , let ’s talk about this in private . ”
24949	24967	24968	24968	I	0	“ I think we should definitely talk about this and I think you should listen for once , ”

25146	25153	25143	25143	Ellie	40	“ Hey . Alex . Alex ? ”
25163	25170	25171	25171	she	40	“ Wow . Is it bad ? ”
25175	25192	25171	25171	she	40	“ Your friend is a little ... well , intoxicated . Are you taking her home ? ”
25226	25246	25247	25247	I	0	“ I ’m not going home . I brought my car here and I ’m not leaving without it , ”
25277	25291	25292	25292	Ellie	40	“ We can come get your car tomorrow . Come on , Alex , ”
25319	25342	25343	25343	I	0	“ Not yet , Ells ! I ’m having a good conversation with our new boss and he ’s at last listening , ”
25348	25371	25343	25343	I	0	“ I have yet to tell him how he should never dismiss his employees ’ hard work so blatantly to their faces ... ”
25372	25375	25376	25376	Ellie	40	“ Alex . ”
25387	25405	25376	25376	Ellie	40	“ God , I ’m sorry , Kit . She never drinks . So when she does ... ”
25406	25409	25416	25416	his	170	“ Right , ”
25425	25434	25435	25435	I	0	“ God , even your accent is sexy , ”
25447	25450	25451	25451	she	40	“ Alexandra , ”
25474	25507	25467	25467	Kit	36	“ You hate me one second and the next you like my voice . Ah , Ms. Croft , we really need to get our heads on straight , do n’t we ? ”
25522	25532	25533	25533	I	0	“ Ellie , give me half an hour more , ”
25582	25589	25578	25578	Ellie	40	“ I ’ll drive her home , ”
25667	25690	25691	25691	I	0	“ Thank you , Kit , I like being with you . It ’s very refreshing and invigorating to chat with you , ”
25695	25702	25703	25703	I	0	“ Ben tried to kiss me , ”
25709	25713	25714	25714	Kit	36	“ I know . ”
25719	25749	25716	25716	his	36	“ I ’m just telling you because I do n’t want you to think that , if you tried , that I’d ... give you the cheek as well . ”
25750	25753	25754	25754	Ellie	40	“ Alex , ”
26044	26047	26048	26052	All those people watching me	597	“ challenges . ”
26242	26251	26252	26252	he	36	“ Feeling tender this morning , Miss Croft ? ”
26270	26276	26265	26265	I	0	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
26277	26298	26299	26299	He	36	“ It happens to the best of us , Alex . Sit up . I ’ve brought you a drink . ”
26345	26355	26332	26332	he	36	“ I really could n’t stomach coffee right now ... ”
26356	26367	26368	26368	Kit	36	“ It ’s not coffee . It ’s something better , ”
26518	26529	26513	26513	I	0	“ Did you just hand me a vodka and lemonade ? ”
26558	26569	26548	26548	him	36	“ No , I ’m not a sadist , Alex . ”
26570	26574	26575	26575	I	0	“ My mistake , ”
26583	26588	26575	26575	I	0	“ I just thought ... ”
26589	26621	26548	26548	him	36	“ Trust me , it ’s lemonade with added sugar . My mum used to make it for me when I was feeling poorly . It works a treat for hangovers . ”
26622	26625	26575	26575	I	0	“ Oh . ”
26695	26700	26701	26701	I	0	“ So your mum ... ”
26711	26718	26701	26701	I	0	“ Do you see her often ? ”
26719	26741	26742	26742	He	612	“ She ’s back in London . So ... no . But we talk . I make sure she ’s well . ”
26760	26763	26750	26750	his	612	“ You ? ”
26822	26873	26809	26809	he	612	“ My parents ... well , my sister and I basically raised ourselves . They ’re workaholics . I suppose you have them to thank for my work ethic , and why I ’m so devoted to Cupid ’s Arrow . It ’s one good thing I learned from them . ”
26874	26887	26896	26896	him	614	“ So all your other strengths I should attribute to you alone ? ”
26928	26935	26916	26916	Kit	36	“ Well , what a night ... ”
26957	26976	26941	26941	he	614	“ Look , if you ’ve come to revel in my misery , I ’ll leave right now . ”
26977	26992	26916	26916	Kit	36	“ Oh come on , Alex . You have to admit it was funny . ”
26993	27010	27093	27093	his	36	“ Funny ? You think me being a drunken mess and abusing my boss is funny ? ”
27011	27031	27093	27093	his	36	“ Well if I can see the funny side , I think you should be able to as well . ”
27032	27037	26916	26916	Kit	36	“ You ’re maddening ! ”
27038	27081	27093	27093	his	36	“ And you think you ’re not ? I could ’ve fired you on the spot , Alex . But I ’m willing to look past it because I know these things happen . And I know you did n’t mean it . ”
27082	27088	27093	27093	his	36	“ Well , I did ... ”
27096	27100	27101	27101	he	36	“ Not everything , ”
27112	27148	27101	27101	he	36	“ And you really are n’t helping your cause . All right , you meant it . At least the bad part of it . Every word of it . At least you were honest . ”
27149	27152	27153	27153	Kit	36	“ Really ? ”
27156	27182	27153	27153	Kit	36	“ Sure . It makes sense , and I forgive you for that . I can be a bit of an ass , I admit . ”
27192	27199	27190	27190	himself	36	“ You thought my accent sexy . ”
27200	27207	27101	27101	he	36	“ I did n’t say that ! ”
27208	27224	27101	27101	he	36	“ Oh come on , Alex . I thought you had a sense of humor ... ”
27225	27234	27190	27190	himself	36	“ I do , when something is funny . ”
27235	27262	27263	27263	He	36	“ Looks like I ’m not the one with the problem . May I remind you that I just came in here with a peace offering ? ”
27270	27281	27263	27263	He	36	“ You mean lemonade ? That ’s your peace offering ? ”
27282	27380	27381	27381	I	0	“ I thought you coming to my party meant you had lightened up a bit . But no . You spent the entire night laughing and joking with me , only to turn at the last moment . You said I was arrogant , rude , bossy , unreasonable ... just about every insult under the bloody sun . Take a hard look in the mirror , Alex . I think you will find that you are all those things and more . But here I am , willing to give you the benefit of the doubt . ”
27470	27477	27478	27478	I	0	“ Look , I ’m sorry , ”
27490	27504	27487	27487	He	36	“ It ’s nothing . I just thought we should hash things out . ”
27505	27513	27514	27514	Kit	36	“ Yeah . Sure , of course . ”
27544	27556	27557	27557	He	36	“ You ’ll grow to like me . I know it . ”
27608	27616	27594	27594	I	0	“ I would n’t push your luck . ”
27667	27675	27676	27676	I	0	“ Thanks for catching me last night , ”
27690	27699	27683	27683	I	0	“ I ’ll always catch you , Alex . ”
27761	27794	27751	27751	Kit	36	“ That ’s what I do best , Alex . Push my luck , I mean . Are you fit to drive yourself home , or shall I call you a taxi ? ”
27795	27802	27751	27751	Kit	36	“ A taxi might be best . ”
27813	27823	27803	27803	I	0	“ I assume dinner is still on for Monday ? ”
27902	27908	27894	27894	I	0	“ I ’ll be there . ”
27909	27919	27920	27920	I	0	“ I ’m free tonight . If you are . ”
27944	27951	27941	27941	I	0	“ I ’m free , too . ”
27968	27976	27977	27977	Kit	36	“ Good . See you tonight then , ”
29041	29046	29047	29047	Kit	36	“ Evening , Alex , ”
29056	29060	29047	29047	Kit	36	“ Shall we ? ”
29089	29095	29117	29117	he	36	“ Let ’s do this . ”
29216	29227	29228	29228	he	36	“ You ’re killing it in that dress , Alex , ”
29255	29268	29269	29269	Kit	36	“ You ’re too kind , but flattery will get you nowhere . ”
29279	29289	29273	29273	his	36	“ Who says I ’m trying to get somewhere ? ”
29290	29305	29306	29306	Kit	36	“ Oh , I ’m almost certain you always have a destination in mind . ”
29318	29332	29306	29306	Kit	36	“ Not tonight . Let ’s just have a good talk , yeah ? ”
29442	29445	29428	29428	He	254	“ Wine ? ”
29483	29490	29498	29498	Kit	36	“ Red , white or rosé ? ”
29491	29497	29498	29498	Kit	36	“ Always red for me , ”
29565	29619	29620	29620	Kit	36	“ So , I ’ve been thinking a lot about your criticisms of the app design . I really liked your thoughts on the markup you gave me . I had to make a lot of changes since the brief is now completely different but I think you ’ll be pleased this time . ”
29631	29636	29620	29620	Kit	36	“ I ’m glad . ”
29659	29668	29669	29669	he	36	“ We got off to a bad start , ”
29672	29731	29669	29669	he	36	“ You were right about me . I am arrogant . I did want to be in control . I did want to belittle you to strengthen my own position . And ... I turned down your ideas out of spite — though I still knew you were n’t giving me as good as I knew you could . ”
29745	29751	29732	29732	I	0	“ What are you saying ? ”
29752	29779	29780	29780	I	0	“ I ’m saying ... let ’s face it , you ’re the best in this business . But I knew you could give me more . ”
29783	29804	29780	29780	I	0	“ Kit ... I do n’t know what to say . Thank you . I ’m glad you pushed me . ”
29834	29882	29832	29832	him	670	“ I ’m glad you came back from it even stronger . I can look at your latest changes to the design Monday and we can move on from this mess . Deal ? We ’re almost to the point where I can give my final approval . ”
29883	29888	29966	29966	He	671	“ Absolutely . Deal . ”
29889	29957	29958	29958	I	0	“ Thank you , Alex . Honestly , I have more than the company ’s future riding on this . I ’m determined to prove to my father I ’m my own man . And if you ’re willing ... I would love to work more closely with you . I guess I ’m open now to having you as a mentor . What do you think ? ”
30036	30057	30058	30058	I	0	“ I think a boy like you needs a lot of training , but I can knock you into shape , ”
30090	30093	30094	30094	he	671	“ Excellent , ”
30097	30111	30094	30094	he	671	“ So I guess it ’s time we got to know one another . ”
30112	30117	30118	30118	I	0	“ I guess so . ”
30124	30153	30118	30118	I	0	“ What you just said about proving yourself to your father . Is there a particular reason he ’d think you ’re not fit to run the company ? ”
30154	30177	30178	30178	Kit	36	“ He believes I ’m exactly like him . And he wanted me to be a copy of my older brother instead . ”
30266	30274	30257	30257	everyone	1154	“ Do you talk to your brother ? ”
30275	30280	30281	30281	He	36	“ Sure . Why ? ”
30287	30310	30281	30281	He	36	“ I do n’t know . I just wondered if there was any competition between you two because of what you said . ”
30311	30333	30334	30334	Kit	36	“ Of course there is . We ’re both healthy males . He wants to be the best and so do I. ”
30345	30398	30341	30341	his	36	“ I admit , he ’s got a couple of years ’ head start in the business world , and he ’s more anal retentive than I ever want to be . But I ’ll be happy to prove to him and to my father both that I ’m my own man . ”
30399	30404	30405	30405	I	0	“ You sound determined . ”
30424	30442	30443	30443	He	36	“ Does that mean you believe I can be serious about something in my life , Alexandra ? ”
30460	30471	30455	30455	I	0	“ It ’s time you told me about you now . ”
30488	30525	30472	30472	He	36	“ So I ’m on the red carpet with Miss Alexandra Croft , who is here representing Cupid ’s Arrow and their first blockbuster romance movie . Miss Croft , what are your hopes and dreams ? ”
30535	30556	30526	30526	I	0	“ Well , getting through a meal with my boss without wanting to kill him might be a good start . ”
30557	30575	30576	30576	Kit	36	“ Why , Miss Croft ? Is he a terrible boss or simply too good to stand ? ”
30584	30601	30576	30576	Kit	36	“ And do you think you ’ll manage to work with him peacefully in the future ? ”
30602	30619	30620	30620	I	0	“ Well , he ’s been reasonably charming lately , so I suppose it ’s possible , ”
30650	30673	30640	30640	Kit	36	“ My , my , Alex . If I did n’t know better , I would say that was a little flirtatious . ”
30696	30710	30711	30711	Kit	36	“ Well , it ’s a good thing you know better , then . ”
30723	30764	30711	30711	Kit	36	“ Miss Croft , you are what most men would describe as a ‘ tough nut to crack . ’ How does one go about capturing your heart ? Are you a fan of the classic wine and dine tactic ? ”
30765	30783	30784	30784	I	0	“ Well , I believe in getting to know each other ’s tastes gradually , not prying , ”
30788	30803	30784	30784	I	0	“ however , I do have some things that I like on a date ... ”
30804	30808	30711	30711	Kit	36	“ Such as ? ”
30809	30812	30711	30711	Kit	36	“ Roses . ”
30813	30818	30784	30784	I	0	“ Ahh , classic . ”
30819	30825	30826	30826	Kit	36	“ But not red ones . ”
30839	30842	30833	30833	his	36	“ Really ? ”
30862	30869	30854	30854	He	36	“ Black is more my type . ”
30870	30879	30880	30880	I	0	“ I should have known . Why black ? ”
30883	30894	30880	30880	I	0	“ Because they are as sinister as they are beautiful . ”
30900	30908	30895	30895	He	36	“ So you have a sinister side ? ”
30909	30922	30923	30923	I	0	“ Not really . I think I look tougher than I am , ”
30930	30935	30936	30936	His	36	“ Do you now ? ”
30944	30952	30936	30936	His	36	“ Somehow I should ’ve known that . ”
30968	30984	30959	30959	Kit	36	“ Wow , I ca n’t decide if that ’s a compliment or an insult . ”
30993	31018	30985	30985	Kit	36	“ The best comments are both , in my experience . Black roses ... well , you ’re full of surprises , Alexandra Croft . ”
31029	31086	31023	31023	his	36	“ Well you ca n’t say that you do n’t find them interesting . I mean , they ’re gorgeous to look at in a unique sort of way . And the fact that they look a little brooding makes it even more pleasant when you get up close and smell their lively , irresistible aroma . ”
31130	31139	31140	31140	Kit	36	“ Here ’s to constantly surprising one another , ”
31229	31243	31215	31215	I	0	“ I do n’t think alcohol is your strong point , Miss Croft . ”
31244	31261	31215	31215	I	0	“ I agree entirely . I feel like newborn Bambi . Stumbling all over the place . ”
31262	31277	31278	31278	I	0	“ Right . When we do this again , we ’ll stick to water . ”
31285	31291	31278	31278	I	0	“ When we ... again ? ”
31365	31395	31349	31349	he	36	“ Well , I thought as colleagues , we could do it again . We should . For the purpose of business . Do n’t you agree , Alex ? ”
31411	31414	31415	31415	I	0	“ Business , ”
31522	31527	31528	31528	he	36	“ Until next time ? ”
31609	31614	31583	31583	I	0	“ Until next time , ”
31822	31826	31827	31827	He	36	“ Good night . ”
32598	32611	32612	32612	Tim	42	“ Way to go , Alex ! The girl can let loose ! ”
32615	32620	32612	32612	Tim	42	“ Okay , enough , ”
32755	32761	32762	32762	I	0	“ Where have you been ? ”
32765	32785	32762	32762	I	0	“ We ’ve been going through the new design ... It would have helped if you ’d been here . ”
32786	32789	32790	32790	he	39	“ Appointment , ”
32809	32815	32816	32816	Ben	39	“ Come on , Alex , ”
32820	32834	32816	32816	Ben	39	“ We ’re colleagues here . It was an appointment , all right ? ”
32862	32871	32872	32872	He	39	“ May I see you privately , Ben ? ”
32927	32972	32973	32973	Ben	39	“ Whatever your personal issues with me are , Ben , leave them outside of the office . First off you ’re late to a scheduled meeting , and now you are disrespecting me in front of my team . It ’s very unprofessional . ”
32977	32985	32973	32973	Ben	39	“ I ’m sorry , all right ? ”
32998	33004	33005	33005	He	39	“ It ’s just that ... ”
33012	33058	33007	33007	his	39	“ Why would you go for a guy like him when there ’s someone waiting right here who worships the ground you walk on ? Why ca n’t you see that he ’s just going to love you and leave you like he always does ? ”
33059	33069	33007	33007	his	39	“ For the last time , I am not — ”
33070	33101	33102	33102	I	0	“ What does he have that I do n’t ? I ’m a good guy , Alex , and you have never once given me an opportunity to show you . ”
33114	33142	33143	33143	I	0	“ You know what , Ben ? I think I know what your problem is . You ’re not nearly as nice as you think you are , ”
33154	33215	33143	33143	I	0	“ You tried to force yourself on me , and when I did n’t feel the same , you decide to punish me by not showing up to work when you know I need your help and input on the relaunch . Somehow , Ben , I do n’t think I ’m the problem . I think it ’s you . ”
33280	33291	33292	33292	I	0	“ I think we should get back to work now , ”
33297	33302	33303	33303	he	720	“ Alex , wait , ”
33315	33393	33306	33306	I	0	“ I ’m sorry for what I did . I was jealous when I saw the way he looked at you and I wanted to stake a claim . And before you go off on me , Alex , please understand I was drunk out of my mind . So just ... please believe , I am truly , genuinely sorry . I value your friendship . I value our working relationship . And I value you . ”
33407	33411	33412	33412	I	0	“ Much better , ”
33418	33427	33428	33428	Ben	39	“ It wo n’t happen again , Alex , ”

39086	39098	39099	39099	Kit	36	“ There are many things you do n’t know about me , ”
39113	39129	39103	39103	he	36	“ That you need to learn firsthand rather than picking it up from office gossip . ”
39130	39134	39103	39103	he	36	“ Like what ? ”
39135	39138	39139	39139	He	36	“ Like ... ”

39166	39180	39162	39162	I	0	“ How come this has never come up in the office gossip before ? ”
39187	39204	39184	39184	his	36	“ I just had n’t found the right lady to bring out this trait in me . ”

39951	39958	39959	39959	he	36	“ Not one bit . Except ... ”
39963	39967	39959	39959	he	36	“ Except what ? ”
39974	39985	39968	39968	His	36	“ I ’m not done with you , Miss Croft . ”

40416	40420	40421	40421	I	0	“ Sounds good . ”
40476	40483	40466	40466	Kit	36	“ You seem nervous . Why ? ”
40558	40571	40572	40572	Kit	36	“ I guess I do n’t know what ’s going on here . ”
40581	40599	40572	40572	Kit	36	“ Yeah . Me neither . But there ’s no use hiding away from it , right ? ”
40604	40609	40600	40600	I	0	“ I guess not . ”

40668	40674	40659	40659	I	0	“ I love that idea ! ”
40702	40717	40697	40697	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe we never thought about doing a double beta before ... ”
40718	40738	40766	40766	him	36	“ I know ... this’ll help us relaunch to the public with more confidence . And avoid any pitfalls . ”
40739	40745	40697	40697	I	0	“ I ’m so excited . ”
40746	40750	40766	40766	him	36	“ Me too . ”

40899	40902	40903	40903	He	36	“ Certainly . ”
40909	40943	40903	40903	He	36	“ I ’ve got it right here . We still need to change the design , but most of the tech side is done . Here . I ’m texting you the link . ”
40989	40995	40996	40996	he	36	“ Send me a heart , ”
41024	41031	41032	41032	Kit	36	“ Now send me a message , ”
41083	41102	41103	41103	he	36	“ We ’ll get the beta test done and then go live once we work out the kinks , ”

41239	41249	41230	41230	he	36	“ I usually make this when I ’m sick . ”
41250	41272	41273	41273	I	0	“ Where did you learn to cook ? Your parents ? Mum never cooked for me , and Alastair is hopeless . ”
41276	41285	41273	41273	I	0	“ Who cooked for you ? Your nanny ? ”
41300	41391	41392	41392	I	0	“ Like I told you , my parents are the most dedicated workaholics you ’ll ever meet . But even though they ’ve worked most of their lives , there was n’t always a lot of money to pay for nannies . They ’re compulsive business starters . So that left me in charge of my sister Helena while we grew up . Unfortunately , I ’m not a very good cook . But I tried , at least . I sort of taught myself to cook her healthy things . ”
41400	41411	41392	41392	I	0	“ Did your brother never cook for you , either ? ”
41412	41475	41476	41476	He	829	“ Not really . We ’re not that close . Plus , William ’s an uptight perfectionist , and although I know he can cook , I doubt he ’d ever cook for anyone . He ’s such a hard - ass , people nicknamed him Stone . He ca n’t stand anything but working and living by the rules . Me ? ”
41482	41496	41497	41497	I	0	“ I bloody love breaking rules . It drives him up the wall . ”
41500	41508	41497	41497	I	0	“ You two sound like complete opposites . ”
41509	41515	41516	41516	Kit	36	“ We ’re vastly different , ”
41519	41541	41516	41516	Kit	36	“ His mum is a socialite . My mum ... Dad met her at Platinum . A strip club in London . ”
41634	41640	41641	41641	I	0	“ Sometimes I overwork myself , ”
41644	41706	41641	41641	I	0	“ I used to think it was a good thing , but seeing my parents take it too far my whole life ... and also after meeting you ... I do n’t know . Until now , it ’s been scary because I had no one to stop me , and I rarely stop myself because of my sister , Helena . ”
41707	41712	41882	41882	his	36	“ What about Helena ? ”
41713	41813	41814	41814	I	0	“ I pay for her studies . My parents encouraged us to make our own way after high school . They think people do n’t put their best foot forward unless they ’re pressured to do so . But Helena ’s my sister , and I want to offer her every opportunity possible so that when her time comes , she will go out there and succeed . I guess that ’s why I ’m a workaholic , too . I ca n’t help it , I was raised to be one , and it ’s in my DNA . ”
41817	41841	41814	41814	I	0	“ You have n’t been around long enough to see me work myself into a perennial state of insomnia during a big launch . ”
41842	41847	41848	41848	Kit	36	“ Really , Alexandra ? ”
41852	41878	41848	41848	Kit	36	“ We ca n’t have that , beautiful . It seems that my father and I have been working you too hard at the office . ”
41921	41956	41957	41957	I	0	“ Hey , I love it . Do n’t take it too easy on me or treat me like I ’m fragile or I ’ll get mad . You wo n’t like me mad . ”
41971	41979	41980	41980	He	36	“ My little redhead , spitting fire . ”
42015	42052	41992	41992	I	0	“ You know , I owed you some soup since the day you brought me your mom ’s lemonade . I think that ’s the day I realized I liked you more than I wanted to . ”
42068	42084	41992	41992	I	0	“ I did n’t bring you lemonade so you would make me soup , Alex . ”
42096	42100	42101	42101	I	0	“ I know , ”
42109	42175	42101	42101	I	0	“ You were nice to me that day . I remember seeing you at that door and thinking , ‘ damn , he ’s here to gloat . ’ But you were n’t . You were actually trying to help me feel better . It was noble of you . One of the many things I ’ve grown to admire and ... appreciate about you . ”
42206	42214	42201	42201	he	36	“ You look sexy when you cook ... ”
42245	42252	42253	42253	I	0	“ I ’m just chopping veggies ... ”
42260	42276	42253	42253	I	0	“ So , that ’s your kink , hmm ? A bit of knife play ? ”
42320	42330	42309	42309	He	36	“ Maybe I ’m just into anything you do . ”
42465	42470	42471	42471	he	36	“ Is this okay ? ”
42485	42495	42496	42496	He	36	“ This is what I ’ve been waiting for . ”
42730	42735	42736	42736	he	36	“ God , Alex ... ”
42775	42786	42787	42787	I	0	“ You do n’t have to be gentle with me , ”
43050	43061	43062	43062	I	0	“ I wo n’t last if you keep doing that , ”
43080	43084	43066	43066	He	36	“ Say please . ”
43123	43135	43136	43136	I	0	“ So , this is how it ’s going to be ... ”
43269	43272	43273	43273	I	0	“ Condoms ? ”

43494	43500	43501	43501	I	0	“ You feel so good , ”

43533	43540	43527	43527	I	0	“ I want you . Please . ”
43541	43556	43557	43557	His	36	“ Shh . Alex ... if you want me , you ’ll have me . ”
43597	43600	43601	43601	I	0	“ Kit ! ”

43700	43702	43697	43697	him	36	“ Alex ”
43732	43750	43751	43751	Kit	36	“ I feel like with all these distractions , I should give up on making the soup . ”
43756	43761	43751	43751	Kit	36	“ Totally worth it . ”
43984	43993	43994	43994	Alastair	43	“ So his suggestions were to your liking ? ”
44000	44025	44026	44026	I	0	“ Very much . We ’re taking it out on a test run this week after Kit gives his final approval of the design , ”

44068	44080	44081	44081	I	0	“ He’s ... stubborn , yes . But not entirely hopeless , ”
44092	44098	44090	44090	him	43	“ Good . Anything else ? ”
44099	44104	44105	44105	I	0	“ Nothing at all , ”

49331	49353	49323	49323	Kit	36	“ Alex did nothing wrong . Her only mistake was trusting a guy like me not to take advantage of her . ”

I thought you were lazy , that you knew nothing about work because you had no experience . That you were nothing but a playboy and I guess I was right , huh ? Because you played me . You played me , Kit Walker . You just told your father — ”

50717	50766	50714	50714	I	0	“ So you were lying to your father ? You ’re saying I did mean more to you than just a simple seduction ? Really ? I meant so much that you do n’t even have any idea of who I am or what my true feelings are ! ”
50778	50823	50773	50773	Kit	36	“ I do n’t know about your feelings , Alex , but I bloody damn well know you were the most vocal protesting my presence here , and that you ’ve turned my bloody head upside down . Not for one minute did I — ”

53052	53121	53039	53039	I	0	“ Silly ! No ! He passed the baton to his youngest son and Kit Walker is just ... He surprised me . Swept me off my feet . Wormed his way into my heart . But one of my office friends leaked a photo of us ... Helena , it was awful . Kit thinks I was in on it just to oust him from the company . ”
53122	53129	53007	53007	she	40	“ Why would you oust him ? ”
53130	53156	53007	53007	she	40	“ Well I was a bit critical when he first took over , thinking he did n’t have it in him to run the company . ”
53157	53162	53163	53163	She	991	“ Oh , Alex . ”
53177	53191	53166	53166	I	0	“ It ’s over now . No point rubbing salt in the wound . ”
53192	53215	53007	53007	she	40	“ You did n’t sleep with your boss — you fell in love with him . That ’s two totally different things . ”
53216	53233	53007	53007	she	40	“ You ’re right . I did both and I do n’t know which is worse . ”
53234	53248	53249	53249	She	991	“ For you ? Both are bad . But both of them together ... ”
53253	53263	53249	53249	She	991	“ What can I do to cheer you up ? ”
53264	53301	53007	53007	she	40	“ Nothing . Hearing your voice helps . And maybe if you went out and had some fun , I ’d know that my sister was out there being happy , and I ’d be happy . ”
53302	53336	53007	53007	she	40	“ Nah . It does n’t count . It needs to be you . You ca n’t just be happy if others are . You need to make your own happiness , Alex . ”
53337	53373	53374	53374	My	0	“ I ca n’t . I ruined this with Kit . Though to be honest ... I think he was only playing with me . And I fell for it . For all of it . ”
53378	53384	53374	53374	My	0	“ I resigned , Helena . ”
53391	53396	53397	53397	I	0	“ Do n’t worry ! ”
53406	53427	53397	53397	I	0	“ I ’ll still help you out with college and your expenses . I ’m going to line up interviews — ”
53428	53462	53404	53404	her	993	“ Alex , that ’s okay . If we can pay for college that ’s great but if not , I ’ll be okay . I do n’t want you bearing my burden . ”
53463	53481	53482	53482	I	0	“ You ’re never a burden . It ’s you and me against the world . Right ? ”
53533	53536	53538	53538	she	997	“ Yes . ”
53551	53559	53560	53560	Helena	40	“ Alex , you ’ll find something , ”
53563	53587	53560	53560	Helena	40	“ You ’re a genius at what you do and any company would be lucky to have you . Any guy , too . ”
53588	53595	53596	53596	I	0	“ Kit does n’t believe that , ”
53599	53619	53596	53596	I	0	“ Falling for him really hurts because even after all this , I want more and I ’m afraid ... ”
53620	53624	53625	53625	I	0	“ Of what ? ”
53635	53667	53627	53627	Kit	36	“ Are you afraid he ’ll want more , too ? Or that he wo n’t and you ’ll be so vulnerable that he ’ll have the power to hurt you ? ”
53668	53674	53675	53675	I	0	“ That . The latter , ”
53689	53710	53675	53675	I	0	“ If you ’d seen the hurt in his eyes when he thought I was conspiring with Ben , Helena . ”
53711	53734	53735	53735	I	0	“ Maybe that ’s a good thing . Maybe that means he does care . Despite not wanting to . Like you . ”
53753	53764	53765	53765	Helena	40	“ Okay so I lack experience in the romance department , ”
53768	53793	53765	53765	Helena	40	“ but if I ’d just resigned and gotten my heart broken , I ’d tell you what my ballsy big sister would say . ”
53794	53800	53801	53801	I	0	“ What would she say ? ”
53805	53829	53830	53830	I	0	“ That the only way to conquer my fears is through action . And that fear leads the way to the greatest opportunities . ”
53833	53853	53830	53830	I	0	“ I ’m glad I ’ve made the effort to put you through Stanford . You ’re so wise . ”
53854	53857	53858	53858	She	40	“ Shush ! ”
53904	53916	53917	53917	she	40	“ But I ’m glad , too . I love you , ”
53920	53955	53917	53917	she	40	“ Alex ... thank you for all your efforts . I never want you to think that I take them for granted . One day I ’m going to pay you back in full . ”
53956	53995	53996	53996	I	0	“ Seeing you succeed in doing something you love is enough for me , Helena . Please do n’t worry . I ’ll keep you posted on how the interviews go . And I love you , too . ”
55230	55241	55242	55242	she	40	“ So are you really going through with the interviews ? ”
55258	55290	55242	55242	she	40	“ I have to . I ca n’t leave Helena hanging and I need to go on with my life . I ’m just hoping Kit gives me a good reference . ”
55307	55316	55317	55317	Ellie	40	“ He ’s completely bereft , you know , ”
55333	55336	55337	55337	she	40	“ Kit , ”
55340	55361	55337	55337	she	40	“ Are you really not coming back ? It seems to me that he did n’t want you to go . ”
55362	55426	55317	55317	Ellie	40	“ It was too messy , Ellie . There was a photo of ... Kit and me . It was sent to Alastair and Kit . Kit thought I was in on it to oust him from the company . I could n’t bear the look of betrayal in his eyes . Worse , Alastair ... well , I betrayed him for real . ”
55427	55462	55337	55337	she	40	“ He and Kit are tense at the office . I do n’t think either of them is happy to see you gone . But why did n’t you tell me about this before ? ”
55463	55481	55337	55337	she	40	“ It was hard to talk about it . Especially when it was Ben who sent it . ”
55482	55492	55493	55493	she	1024	“ Ben ! Oh my gosh , that snake ! ”
55496	55536	55493	55493	she	1024	“ No wonder he got fired yesterday ! He was called into Kit ’s office and Angela says when he came out he was white as a sheet . He packed up his things and security escorted him out . ”
55537	55546	55595	55595	He	36	“ I can only imagine how that went . ”
55547	55559	55560	55560	she	1024	“ He was in Kit ’s office for a long while , ”
55708	55711	55712	55712	Ellie	40	“ Holy ... ”
55797	55800	55801	55801	he	36	“ Ellie , ”
55804	55807	55801	55801	he	36	“ Kit . ”
55858	55861	55866	55866	his	36	“ Alex , ”
55879	55910	55866	55866	his	36	“ We ’re out window shopping . Looking for new suits for my upcoming interviews . I hope you ’re well , Kit . It ’s nice to see you . ”
55924	55931	55916	55916	he	36	“ Alex , do n’t go . ”
55996	56003	56004	56004	I	0	“ I ca n’t do this , ”
56007	56014	56004	56004	I	0	“ Alex , look at me . ”
56039	56046	56036	56036	his	36	“ Did you get my messages ? ”
56058	56061	56062	56062	I	0	“ Yes , ”
56078	56081	56071	56071	I	0	“ And ? ”
56093	56100	56084	56084	his	36	“ And it ’s too late . ”
56110	56118	56105	56105	Kit	36	“ I love you , Miss Croft . ”
56160	56170	56171	56171	I	0	“ Or would you rather I call you Alexandra ? ”
56185	56266	56182	56182	his	36	“ Alexandra Croft ... I love you . Despite wanting to keep things professional . Despite thinking maybe you ’d betrayed me . Despite feeling scared out of my bloody wits because what I felt for you was too strong . I still loved you . I was wrong , and I can not tell you how sorry I am . I was afraid you ’d gotten too firm a hold of me . And you know what , Alexandra ? ”
56278	56286	56272	56272	he	1036	“ I was right to be concerned . ”
56298	56346	56293	56293	he	1036	“ Because nobody has ever gotten this firm a hold of me before . I ’ve never thought of anyone as much as I think of you . Or wanted , or respected , or admired , or needed a woman as much as I need you . ”
56663	56672	56673	56673	Ellie	40	“ I ’ll give you two a moment , ”
56736	56741	56742	56742	I	0	“ You hurt me , ”
56745	56752	56753	56753	he	36	“ You hurt me , too , ”
56757	56778	56753	56753	he	36	“ I ’m not only talking about the email . You pulled away from me , and it hurt me . ”
56779	56797	56798	56798	he	36	“ I was coming to terms with the fact that I have feelings for you , Alex , ”
56806	56829	56798	56798	he	36	“ Can you give a guy a moment to get his bearings after you knock him off his damn bloody feet here ? ”
56839	56857	56830	56830	I	0	“ Maybe . But you caused some chaos in my life , Kit . Quite a lot . ”
56858	56875	56879	56879	his	36	“ I know , and I ’ll do anything necessary to make it up to you . ”
56888	56895	56896	56896	he	36	“ I love you , Alex , ”
56917	56976	56896	56896	he	36	“ Please believe me when I say I never wanted to hurt you . That whole Ben thing threw me for a loop . He was always hanging around you , and it made me jealous . The mere idea of you and him being together while all I wanted was to make you mine drove me crazy . ”
56982	57037	56979	56979	his	36	“ I drilled him . For hours . He would n’t admit his guilt . When he finally did , he confessed to acting alone . He does n’t want us together , Alex . He wants you , and I ca n’t blame him for that . But he ca n’t have you ... ”
57058	57097	57046	57046	he	36	“ He ca n’t have you , because you gave me everything you had ... and I ’m keeping you . I ’m dating you . I ’m protecting you . I’m ... into you , Miss Croft . ”
57246	57340	57240	57240	I	0	“ Those messages you sent to me ... I did n’t want to reach out because I was afraid they were n’t true . I was hurting too much over you . I was sad that you ’d doubt me ... but you ’re right . In the beginning I did n’t want you . I misjudged you . But after getting to know you ... Kit , I ’ve fallen and there ’s no going back — and neither would I want to go back . Not to a life without you . ”
57458	57498	57450	57450	Kit	36	“ We need to tell Alastair . Tell him that we ’d like to work together again . That we want another shot . If he forgives me for betraying his trust , he might consider taking me back — ”
57499	57553	57554	57554	Kit	36	“ He knows you were n’t conspiring with Ben . And what we did was n’t reckless . We kept it strictly professional in the office . And it was n’t wrong , Alex . He ’ll want you back . I want you back . At the office and in my life . ”
57566	57573	57574	57574	He	36	“ Do n’t fret , Alex . ”
57585	57594	57576	57576	his	36	“ We ’ll try to make him see . ”
57661	57671	57672	57672	I	0	“ Alex , you ’re scaring me a bit ... ”
57678	57695	57672	57672	I	0	“ No , it ’s just that ... I want to eat you up with kisses . ”
57703	57711	57696	57696	His	36	“ I would n’t object to that . ”
57761	57793	57753	57753	his	36	“ Bloody woman , you ’re driving me crazy . Come here . I ’ve missed you . How can I miss someone I met only this year so damn much ? ”
57794	57802	57803	57803	I	0	“ I ’ve wondered the same thing , ”
57858	57866	57867	57867	he	36	“ Shit , are you really here ? ”
57880	57893	57870	57870	I	0	“ Yes , I ’m here . Were you expecting someone else ? ”
57894	57901	57902	57902	Kit	36	“ No , no one else . ”
57915	57922	57902	57902	Kit	36	“ God , I missed you . ”
58004	58007	58008	58008	His	36	“ Kit ... ”

58017	58026	58027	58027	Kit	36	“ Let ’s try not to ruin this . ”
58154	58157	58144	58144	He	36	“ Yes , ”
58214	58219	58220	58220	He	36	“ Come here then . ”
58234	58239	58220	58220	He	36	“ I can walk . ”
58240	58266	58267	58267	He	36	“ I know you can walk , Miss Croft . I know you can talk , too . But right now you ’re doing neither . ”
58396	58406	58388	58388	he	36	“ Where do you want me to touch you ? ”
58407	58410	58411	58411	I	0	“ Everywhere , ”
58430	58434	58424	58424	He	36	“ So eager . ”

58931	58938	58914	58914	Kit	36	“ I want to taste you . ”

59256	59266	59267	59267	he	36	“ What do you want me to do next ? ”
59280	59283	59271	59271	he	36	“ I ... ”

59288	59295	59303	59303	his	36	“ I want you inside me . ”
59296	59300	59301	59301	He	36	“ Not yet . ”

60099	60156	60090	60090	I	0	“ Let me do the talking first . I owe your father an explanation for the mess I made of things . And do n’t grab my hand or anything . I ’d rather he not see me blushing . You have an amazing capacity for making me blush and I want to look professional here . ”

61048	61100	61101	61101	He	36	“ I ’ll allow it if that ’s what she really wants . But I know it is n’t . I know this company is hers as much as it ’s ours . And I want her by my side . I know that with your blessing , she ’ll reconsider . ”
61124	61198	61121	61121	his	43	“ You two are young and have a lot to learn . Corporations are run by teams that work well together . Trust is integral to the process . I know you ’re both young ... I was young once . I understand . I ’m glad things have turned out well between you two — but they could have gone very differently . And I hope you both are aware of that . ”

And you did a good job making it so that the photo will never be seen by anyone else . But the fact of the matter is things could have really blown up in your face . It would n’t have been good for Cupid ’s Arrow . ”
