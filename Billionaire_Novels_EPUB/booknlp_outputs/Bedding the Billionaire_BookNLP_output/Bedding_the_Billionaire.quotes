655	661	662	662	She	42	" My name 's Abbey . "
669	698	662	662	She	42	" I 'm here to inform you , Mr. Vane , that you 've been selected to receive a free massage , compliments of Le Miridian hotel management . "
784	787	788	788	She	42	" Wait ! "
798	803	804	804	she	42	" It 's free , "
808	836	804	804	she	42	" No thanks . I just arrived in Melbourne , I 'm tired and I want to get some sleep . I do n't need a massage . "
967	975	976	976	Her	42	" Jeez , are you all right ? "
1088	1092	1093	1093	he	117	" Come inside , "
1101	1108	1093	1093	he	117	" Run them under cold water . "
1162	1167	1168	1168	he	117	" How 's that ? "
1269	1272	1273	1273	he	117	" Okay ? "
1316	1319	1320	1320	she	42	" Fine , "
1329	1337	1320	1320	she	42	" Thanks for taking care of me . "
1338	1356	1320	1320	she	42	" You know you should 've been more careful . You could 've done some serious damage . "
1397	1402	1403	1403	she	42	" You 're right , "
1406	1415	1403	1403	she	42	" Are you sure your fingers are okay ? "
1422	1426	1416	1416	Abbey	42	" All attached . "
1427	1436	1437	1437	He	117	" Good . Next time be more careful . "
1461	1468	1457	1457	She	42	" How about that massage now ? "
1553	1559	1550	1550	his	117	" Persistent are n't you ? "
1587	1613	1574	1574	he	117	" I just want to give you your prize from hotel management . They 'd be most upset to find out I did n't deliver . "
1614	1618	1619	1619	Damien	45	" I guess ... "
1635	1641	1619	1619	Damien	45	" I wo n't bite . "
1658	1670	1671	1671	She	42	" Come into the bedroom where you 'll be more comfortable . "
1690	1696	1685	1685	He	117	" How about the lounge ? "
1697	1704	1705	1705	She	42	" That 'll be fine too . "
1767	1773	1754	1754	his	117	" What are you doing ? "
1808	1817	1801	1801	her	42	" I like to do this by moonlight . "
1818	1821	1822	1822	He	117	" Moonlight ? "
1834	1845	1822	1822	He	117	" I think the moon 's gone behind the clouds . "
1846	1873	1874	1874	She	42	" It 'll come out again soon . This is Melbourne . You Sydney - siders do n't know how the weather can change down here . "
1879	1883	1874	1874	She	42	" Like that . "
1981	1991	1992	1992	he	117	" How did you know I was from Sydney ? "
2001	2008	1992	1992	he	117	" Um , management told me . "
2084	2092	2093	2093	His	117	" You sure you 're a masseur ? "
2128	2134	2135	2135	His	117	" An official hotel masseur ? "
2145	2149	2150	2150	she	42	" Of course , "
2168	2175	2162	2162	She	42	" Call reception if you like . "
2234	2239	2240	2240	His	117	" I believe you . "
2247	2270	2240	2240	His	117	" I do n't know anyone in Melbourne . No one who 'd send me a ... masseur , already paid for . "
2271	2274	2275	2275	she	42	" Good , "
2295	2304	2305	2305	he	117	" Let 's just get one thing straight , "
2316	2346	2305	2305	he	117	" I 've never had a ... massage ... before and if this one is n't what I expect then I 'll ask you to leave . Got it ? "
2404	2407	2408	2408	she	42	" Sit , "
2447	2459	2460	2460	she	42	" So I can see the moon when it finally appears , "
2853	2855	2843	2843	She	42	" sorry "
2917	2950	2903	2903	Lucy	43	" Just enjoy yourself , Abbey . You 're going to be in the Executive Suite of a five star hotel with an attractive man . Just let whatever happens , happen . "
2951	2968	2903	2903	Lucy	43	" But what if he , you know , expects me to have sex with him ? "
2969	2976	2977	2977	Lucy	43	" Just do it , Girl , "
2981	3027	2977	2977	Lucy	43	" Enjoy unadulterated sex with a complete stranger . For once , let yourself go . You deserve it after what you 've been through . No strings , no expectations , no waiting by the phone tomorrow . Trust me , it 's exhilarating . "
4125	4131	4132	4132	he	45	" That feels so good , "
4135	4142	4132	4132	he	45	" Do n't stop . Please . "
4355	4361	4362	4362	Damien	45	" What are you doing ? "
4399	4406	4410	4410	her	42	" The moon 's too bright . "
4479	4482	4483	4483	he	45	" Stop , "
4487	4491	4483	4483	he	45	" Turn around . "
4689	4694	4695	4695	he	45	" I want you , "
4720	4726	4729	4729	herself	42	" And I want you , "
4732	4748	4729	4729	herself	42	" Good . Two adults , mutual consent . There 's nothing wrong with this . "
4749	4754	4755	4755	Abbey	42	" Nothing at all , "
5159	5165	5166	5166	she	42	" What 's the matter ? "
5170	5176	5177	5177	He	45	" No condom . You ? "
5196	5203	5177	5177	He	45	" No . Maybe the hotel — "
5209	5215	5206	5206	his	45	" I ca n't wait . "
5276	5297	5264	5264	he	45	" Leave them on . If I 'm going to do this , I 'm going to do it right . "
7117	7128	7129	7129	Abbey	42	" What do you mean you did n't get it ? "
7141	7147	7148	7148	Lucy	43	" The camera 's broken . "
7182	7196	7175	7175	She	43	" Sorry . I sort of dropped it when I was setting up . "
7197	7227	7228	7228	Abbey	42	" Sorry ! You 're sorry ! I just slept with a complete stranger so you could get those shots and you tell me the damn thing 's broken ! "
7251	7267	7268	7268	She	42	" I knew you slept with him ! That 's fantastic ! He was gorgeous . "
7273	7300	7268	7268	She	42	" So the broken camera is n't such a bad thing after all — at least now you 'll get to do it all over again . "
7747	7752	7753	7753	Abbey	42	" Do it again ? "
7769	7774	7758	7758	Lucy	43	" I ca n't ! "
7789	7799	7800	7800	Lucy	43	" Why not ? Was n't it any good ? "
7859	7864	7848	7848	Abbey	42	" It was great . "
7887	7890	7883	7885	a complete stranger	105	" But — "
7891	7900	7901	7901	Abbey	42	" Well , then , just do it . "
8033	8055	8056	8056	She	42	" Cool down , girl , I need to get a new camera . You 'll have to wait until tomorrow . "
8075	8082	8071	8071	Abbey	42	" I must look a mess . "
8083	8103	8104	8104	Abbey	42	" You look like a girl who 's had a good bonk and is in need of another one . "
8109	8113	8104	8104	Abbey	42	" Tomorrow then . "
8193	8213	8349	8349	Lucy	43	" What if he wo n't let me in next time ? What if he does n't want to — "
8214	8271	8272	8272	Abbey	42	" Do n't be silly . I saw his expression before you closed the curtains , and he was hungry for you . And I mean hungry . The guy looked like he was going to explode any minute , all over that nice couch . I 'm surprised you actually got him into the bedroom . "
8277	8287	8272	8272	Abbey	42	" And made him wait until I 'd finished . "
8288	8302	8355	8355	her	43	" Really ? That long ? Wow , this guy 's got stamina . "
8303	8326	8272	8272	Abbey	42	" Or sheer willpower . I got the impression he does n't often let his emotions rule him like they did tonight . "
8327	8345	8346	8346	Abbey	42	" That was n't emotion ruling him , that was a very impressive appendage between his legs . "
8386	8425	8371	8371	She	43	" The guy does n't have willpower . You saw the profile , he 's had sex with more people than me ! No , willpower he has n't got when it comes to having sex with strangers . "
8712	8722	8723	8723	She	43	" I 'll call you tomorrow , Big Boy . "
8728	8741	8723	8723	She	43	" I might need this place tomorrow night again . That okay ? "
8746	8753	8723	8723	She	43	" That 'll cost you extra . "
8754	8760	8761	8761	Lucy	43	" You just name it , "
8764	8775	8761	8761	Lucy	43	" and I 'll do it . You know that . "
9658	9665	9656	9656	Abbey	42	" Going somewhere , Big Boy ? "
9688	9691	9692	9692	He	49	" Abbey ? "
9736	9744	9731	9731	Nick	49	" It is Abbey is n't it ? "
9828	9835	9836	9836	he	49	" What are you doing here ? "
9985	9995	9996	9996	He	49	" Thought I 'd drop past and say hello . "
9999	10002	9996	9996	He	49	" Why ? "
10034	10048	10049	10049	Abbey	42	" Oh , right . Come upstairs and we 'll sort it out . "
10135	10155	10156	10156	She	42	" Actually , uh , I thought we could have a drink first . Then maybe something to eat . "
10161	10173	10156	10156	She	42	" Then maybe come back here about ten . That okay ? "
10462	10465	10466	10466	Nick	49	" Sure , "
10477	10493	10466	10466	Nick	49	" He pointed to where a few people sat at outdoor tables up the road . "
10512	10513	10506	10506	I	0	" "
10525	10525	10523	10523	Damien	45	"
10575	10606	10570	10570	Nick	49	" I know what I want and I do n't waste time getting it . I 've found that 's the best way to be in my line of work . "
10617	10626	10607	10607	He	49	" I do n't expect you to understand . "
10976	10979	10980	10980	Abbey	42	" Hi . "
11002	11011	11012	11012	she	42	" Not having second thoughts , I hope , "
11056	11063	11044	11044	he	49	" No , of course not . "
11117	11126	11127	11127	she	42	" I ordered us a bottle of Chardonnay , "
11135	11142	11127	11127	she	42	" I hope that 's okay . "
11143	11151	11152	11152	She	42	" As long as it 's cold . "
11171	11181	11168	11168	her	42	" A bit hot and bothered today are you ? "
11182	11191	11192	11192	They	337	" Hot , yes . Bothered , never . "
11435	11440	11441	11441	Abbey	42	" You seem uncomfortable , "
11463	11471	11472	11472	she	42	" Worried about being seen with me ? "
11475	11484	11472	11472	she	42	" No ! No , of course not . "
11488	11500	11485	11485	He	49	" I do n't know anyone in Melbourne anyway , so ... "
11514	11518	11501	11501	Abbey	42	" I see . "
11700	11704	11705	11705	he	49	" Nice wine , "
11714	11727	11728	11728	She	42	" It 's one of my favorites . I always order it — "
11776	11782	11783	11783	Abbey	42	" How was your conference ? "
11790	11798	11799	11799	She	42	" How did you know about that ? "
11802	11807	11799	11799	She	42	" They told me . "
11808	11811	11783	11783	Abbey	42	" They ? "
11812	11843	11783	11783	Abbey	42	" Hotel management . You know , complementary massage and all that . I asked what you 're here for and they said a software conference at the Crown Complex . "
11844	11847	11848	11848	Nick	49	" Seminar , "
11870	11884	11865	11865	he	49	" So you 're a salesman for a software firm . How exciting . "
12333	12343	12344	12344	Abbey	42	" Actually I 'm the Vice President of Marketing . "
12347	12360	12344	12344	Abbey	42	" Right . Very impressive . So it all went well today ? "
12402	12414	12415	12415	He	49	" Abbey , I do n't really want to discuss work . "
12422	12428	12415	12415	He	49	" Tell me about you . "
12438	12450	12429	12429	She	42	" Um , okay . What do you want to know ? "
12492	12502	12503	12503	She	42	" Have you lived in Melbourne all your life ? "
12506	12510	12511	12511	She	42	" Like it ? "
12514	12529	12511	12511	She	42	" It 's okay . I 'd really like to travel to Europe though . "
12530	12540	12560	12560	her	42	" Anywhere in particular or just Europe in general ? "
12541	12544	12560	12560	her	42	" France . "
12545	12554	12555	12555	Abbey	42	" Really ? I was there last year . "
12564	12578	12560	12560	her	42	" What 's it like ? Is Paris as beautiful as they say ? "
12579	12630	12633	12633	he	49	" I do n't know who ' they ' are or what they say about Paris , but yes , it 's a beautiful city . Very romantic . Well , I was there for work , but I 'm sure it would be romantic if I had female company . "
12687	12699	12700	12700	she	42	" You should 've had a holiday while you were there , "
12703	12740	12700	12700	she	42	" You know , added another week on the end , after your business was finished . That 's what I would have done if I were ever lucky enough to go to Paris for work . "
12741	12767	12700	12700	she	42	" Easier said than done . I had to fly back to Sydney . It 's difficult to be away from the office for long . "
12768	12777	12778	12778	Nick	49	" Your boss sounds like a task master . "
12781	12801	12778	12778	Nick	49	" He is . But that 's okay , I like what I do . It 's my passion . "
12805	12833	12802	12802	She	42	" Strange passion . Perhaps if you had a hobby you 'd learn to relax a little more . You could take up yoga or bush walking . "
12890	12914	12915	12915	She	385	" I have responsibilities to my employees . I ca n't just take time off here and there when I feel like it . "
12918	12938	12915	12915	She	385	" I do n't see why not . All work and no play makes Damien a very dull man . "
12945	12953	12954	12954	he	49	" I was n't always a workaholic , "
12973	12985	12954	12954	he	49	" I used to be pretty wild when I was younger . "
12986	12994	12995	12995	He	49	" Really ? Tell me about it . "
12998	13007	12995	12995	He	49	" You 're nosy , are n't you ? "
13015	13022	13008	13008	She	385	" I 'm just being friendly . "
13112	13123	13124	13124	he	49	" I think we 'll drop that topic of conversation , "
13140	13145	13131	13131	her	42	" Yes , Sir ! "
13153	13167	13168	13168	she	42	" Let 's talk about something you do n't mind talking about then , "
13212	13216	13168	13168	she	42	" Like what ? "
13217	13231	13232	13232	He	49	" Where else have you been ? Other than France , I mean . "
13235	13246	13232	13232	He	49	" You name it , I 've probably been there . "
13247	13252	13253	13253	She	42	" Wow . Really ? "
13258	13272	13253	13253	She	42	" Either you 're incredibly rich or you 've got a great job . "
13297	13319	13287	13287	He	49	" The job takes me places but I never really get to see them . Not the way I want to . "
13320	13324	13293	13293	her	42	" Which is ? "
13325	13352	13353	13353	He	49	" Slowly . I 'd rather take my time . Spend a few weeks in a village in Tuscany or on felucca floating down the Nile . "
13356	13380	13353	13353	He	49	" All I get to see is the inside of a hotel room and an office block or two . Not very interesting . "
13437	13444	13445	13445	Abbey	42	" Ooh , yes , Egypt , "
13448	13489	13445	13445	Abbey	42	" Another place I want to visit . I love ancient history . I even thought about becoming an archaeologist but it meant an extra three years and I 'd already had enough of study after finishing my Arts degree . "
13518	13533	13507	13507	Nick	49	" You went to university ? What did you major in ? Sensual massage ? "
13548	13552	13553	13553	she	42	" Very funny , "
13582	13589	13576	13576	she	42	" That topic 's off limits . "
13593	13602	13576	13576	she	42	" No . I want to know more . "
13603	13614	13615	13615	Her	42	" I said it 's off limits . Got it ? "
13660	13671	13672	13672	he	49	" Guess it 's back to travel again , then , "
13732	13735	13736	13736	he	49	" Antarctica , "
13739	13755	13736	13736	he	49	" That 's the one place I do n't want to go . Too cold . "
13819	13827	13828	13828	she	42	" Way too cold for me too , "
13831	13837	13828	13828	she	42	" I prefer the heat . "
13838	13846	13828	13828	she	42	" Then you 'd be happy today . "
13847	13886	13887	13887	Her	42	" Well , today was exceptional , even by Melbourne 's standards . Although I do like it like this . It reminds me of summers by the pool or down the beach when I was a kid . "
13952	13969	13945	13945	she	42	" I take it from that look on your face that you like the beach too ? "
14001	14012	13986	13986	His	49	" Are you ready to order , sir , madam ? "
14040	14047	14049	14049	Abbey	42	" The seafood 's great here , "
14057	14064	14051	14051	He	49	" You 've eaten here before ? "
14080	14084	14085	14085	She	42	" Many times . "
14113	14132	14106	14106	She	42	" Once or twice a long time ago . I ca n't afford this sort of place anymore . "
14254	14272	14273	14273	She	42	" Actually , any of the French Impressionists . Which is why I want to visit Paris . "
14276	14289	14273	14273	She	42	" The Musée d'Orsay has a fabulous collection , so I hear . "
14300	14320	14290	14290	He	49	" You know , I did n't think masseurs were the type of people to go to art galleries . "
14340	14351	14337	14337	her	42	" You should n't judge a book by its cover . "
14457	14462	14454	14454	her	42	" Time to go ? "
14535	14538	14539	14539	she	42	" Nearly , "
15045	15048	15021	15021	she	42	" Abbey ! "
15107	15110	15099	15100	The man	117	" Tarken ! "
15121	15130	15135	15135	her	42	" What the Hell are you doing here ? "
15163	15171	15172	15173	The man	117	" Having dinner . Who 's he ? "
15185	15191	15178	15178	his	117	" None of your business . "
15192	15205	15221	15221	his	49	" None of my business ? Abbey , come on , I — "
15206	15216	15221	15221	his	49	" She said it 's none of your business , "
15225	15229	15221	15221	his	49	" Now leave . "
15267	15279	15256	15256	Tarken	46	" Who do you think you are , ordering me around ? "
15320	15325	15326	15326	Nick	49	" Who are you ? "
15329	15334	15326	15326	Nick	49	" Abbey 's boyfriend . "
15435	15442	15444	15444	Abbey	42	" You are not my boyfriend ! "
15456	15500	15446	15446	her	42	" You seem to have forgotten that I found you kissing Melinda yesterday . She told me you 'd slept together while I was away . And I seem to recall telling you that we were through when I handed in my resignation . "
15516	15523	15525	15525	Nick	49	" I think you should leave , "
15543	15546	15547	15548	The waiter	351	" Waiter ! "
15555	15562	15547	15548	The waiter	351	" This man is bothering us . "
15573	15586	15568	15568	his	46	" I was just leaving . I 've lost my appetite anyway . "
15636	15640	15641	15641	he	49	" You okay ? "
15652	15657	15658	15658	she	42	" Sorry about that , "
15661	15671	15658	15658	she	42	" I did n't mean to cause a scene . "
15672	15680	15681	15681	Nick	49	" You did n't . He did . "
15837	15845	15832	15832	he	49	" So , is he your boyfriend ? "
15846	15851	15898	15898	Her	42	" Not any more . "
15852	15862	15863	15863	She	42	" He cheated on you with someone called Melinda ? "
15869	15892	15863	15863	She	42	" He 's a fool . If I were him , I would n't let such a beautiful woman like you go . "
16082	16099	16100	16100	She	42	" Abbey , when you said you handed in your resignation , what did you mean ? "
16130	16141	16124	16124	She	42	" No more questions . Not about Tarken , okay ? "
16145	16154	16124	16124	She	42	" Now wait a minute . I deserve — "
16155	16163	16164	16164	she	42	" Let 's get out of here , "
16170	16209	16164	16164	she	42	" He would have pursued the issue of the resignation and Tarken , except those words made him forget everything except the touch of Abbey 's toes . He signaled the waiter , paid the bill and stood . "
16214	16828	16829	16829	Abbey	42	" Abbey followed Nick outside where it was still warm , despite the sun 's disappearance over an hour ago . She felt strangely relieved to be out of the restaurant , where a surprisingly pleasant meal had turned sour with Tarken 's unexpected arrival . Of all the restaurants to choose , he chose that one ! She had n't thought of Tarken all day , and with the game of footsies under the table , she 'd been caught with her pants down . Well , Damien had . It annoyed her that she 'd gotten upset over Tarken 's appearance , and his demand . Not because she wanted Tarken to see her like that , but because she did n't want Damien to see her as anything less than composed and in control . Damien Vane was a no - nonsense , straight down the line , man . He did n't seem like the type of guy to want a flighty female in his bed , which was exactly where she wanted to be . And not just for the camera either , she realized . For herself . She 'd enjoyed their encounter the night before — she had n't been able to think of anything else all day . It had put a serious dent in her job hunting when she 'd fumbled through an interview with a legal firm . The image of Damien in all his naked glory caused her to stumble over her words and appear a complete idiot . But now she was n't just thinking about last night either , she was also thinking about tonight . It had been her idea to have dinner first . Lucy had expected her to just go straight up to his hotel again and take it from there , but Abbey wanted to see Damien before they got down to business . She needed to know more about the man she 'd slept with . Call her old fashioned — and Lucy had — but she liked to at least have one normal conversation with the men she took to bed . This time , the conversation had waited till later , but it had still been necessary as far as Abbey was concerned . Besides , she could n't wait until ten o'clock . She thought that the sooner she saw him , the sooner the agony of waiting would be over . But it was n't . The agony was still there , even now as she tried to keep pace with his quick , long stride down Collins Street to the hotel . That 's why she 'd put her foot to the bulge in his trousers — the agony had become too much . That was the only way she could explain her behavior tonight . She 'd never done anything so daring , so brazen , in her life . She wondered what would have happened if Tarken had n't shown up . Could she have made Damien go all the way ? The thought sent a sudden surge of power through her that instantly dampened her . She could n't wait to get upstairs . The doorman nodded to Damien as he tugged her gently but firmly alongside him . He definitely seemed eager to get to his room . Abbey smiled to herself . Good . It was ten o'clock , and Lucy would be ready with the camera . Damien fumbled the key in the keyhole . Taking a deep breath , he suddenly turned and kissed her roughly . His breathing came in ragged gasps . "
16831	16895	16829	16829	Abbey	42	" he said , looking at her . His eyes were dark and hooded . His hand flew around her waist and he pulled her to him . She could feel the bulge in his pants and she deliberately rubbed herself against it as she kissed him full on the lips . He kissed her back , urgently , before drawing himself away . "
16901	16906	16896	16896	I	0	" he whispered hoarsely . "
16913	17346	16829	16829	Abbey	42	" Damien had the door open and was tugging her through after him , roughly . Suddenly she knew . And liked it . Wanted it . The door slammed shut and he pushed her back against it . He kissed her and she clawed at his shirt , popping two buttons as she tore if off him , revealing his bare chest . She sunk her teeth into a nipple and he growled , throwing his head back . Damien 's hands roamed across her thighs , pushing her skirt up and over her hips . His long fingers went behind her and cupped her buttocks . He massaged the flesh and plucked at the thong as his mouth sank into her throat . He lifted her off the ground and she wrapped her legs around him , her back still against the door . Abbey gasped when he kissed her nipples through her bra . He 'd managed to get her top over her breasts , and she felt a hand reach up and unhook her bra . It fell away and he suckled the flesh , licking at the ripe buds , nibbling until they were raw and ready . She fumbled with his trousers and finally unzipped the fly . She reached in and grabbed his erection , releasing it from its tight prison . He gasped , then his sucking became urgent as she wrapped her fingers around the hard shaft . His entire body quivered . Damien seemed to lose control then . He tore at her panties , ripping the thong in two and throwing the pieces to the floor . He pressed her into the door as she guided him into her sleek wetness . He felt thick and hot as he slammed into her , deep , filling her . His thrusts were urgent , almost desperate , as he hammered her to the door . Abbey bit back a cry as she rode him until the familiar tingling waves engulfed her , sending her body into spasms . Then Damien shuddered beneath her thighs and let out a long , low groan as he threw his head back and spurted into her . They stood like that for a long moment — Abbey against the door , her legs around Damien 's waist . His head was buried in the hair at her shoulder . She could feel his hot breath , hear it change from heavy and rough to controlled . Slowly , he pulled away and let her down gently . "
17349	17356	16829	16829	Abbey	42	" he mumbled , suddenly coloring . "
17369	17386	17364	17364	I	0	" Abbey , still trying to catch her breath , placed a finger to his lips . "
17407	17412	17413	17413	I	0	" He turned away . "
17422	17426	17432	17434	a virtual stranger	434	" She laughed . "
17436	17452	17432	17434	a virtual stranger	434	" She caught Damien 's face in hers and forced him to look at her . "
17462	17463	17458	17458	Lucy	43	" "
17468	17479	17480	17481	A friend	241	" Abbey plucked at Damien 's lips with her own . "
17483	17534	17480	17481	A friend	241	" She nibbled his mouth , tasting , sucking , then , as his hands came up to catch her face , she delved and let her tongue go where it wanted to go . He kissed her back , hard and heavy . He felt good . Damn good . "
17540	17550	17551	17551	You	436	" she whispered against his lips . Damien smiled . "
17555	17699	17551	17551	You	436	" She had to be , Abbey thought . There was a wall between them and the lounge room . There 's no way Lucy would have caught any of that on film . Just as well . She did n't particularly want her best friend watching her in the act . Besides , gentle , sensuous lovemaking after that hard and fast effort was just what she needed . And wanted . Damien picked her up and carried her into the lounge . He placed her on the couch and she sat up , kissing him . They were both still more or less clothed although disheveled . Abbey reached up and removed his shirt , sighing as she took in his masculinity . He had the body of an Adonis — hard , lean and muscular in all the right places . "
17705	17720	17700	17700	You	437	" she said , tracing a finger along the muscles of chest and shoulder . "
17723	17763	17700	17700	You	437	" he said through kisses . He sat back on the couch and lifted her top . Her bra had already come off , so her breasts spilled out . He took one in his mouth . Then stopped . "
17767	17771	17700	17700	You	437	" he said . "
17777	17778	17779	17779	We	438	" "
17786	17787	17779	17779	We	438	" "
17803	17807	17794	17794	you	0	" He nodded . "
17821	17825	17817	17817	I	0	" She nodded . "
17829	17978	17828	17828	I.	0	" That seemed to be enough for him . He returned to his task of suckling , the issue already forgotten . Abbey glanced at the window . The curtains were open . Lucy would be able to see everything . But suddenly it did n't matter . Lucy had seen her breasts before at the gym although not with a man on the end of them . And no one else was going to see the photos except for Damien 's wife . His wife . A faceless woman floated through Abbey 's thoughts and she closed her eyes . She clenched hard as something tore at her gut . This was n't supposed to happen . She was n't supposed to feel guilty . Suddenly she felt like she was being smothered . As if something was pressing on her chest and stopping her from breathing . "
17981	17989	17990	17990	We	439	" she said , pushing Damien away . "
17998	18004	17994	17994	I	0	" He blinked at her . "
18011	18016	18017	18017	I	0	" he said thickly . "
18027	18071	18073	18073	you	42	" He stopped and looked down , drawing in a deep breath . He ran a hand through his already messy hair and sat back . She could tell he was struggling with his inner turmoil , desperately trying to regain his composure . "
18082	18134	18079	18079	I	0	" It did n't sound like it , Abbey thought . Nor did it look like it — his cock protruded from his shorts , thick and throbbing . Ready . Abbey swallowed . She wanted him inside her again . Very much . Lucy 's voice crept into her brain : "
18186	18196	18141	18141	she	440	" Abbey had nodded then and she nodded now . "
18204	18261	18199	18199	I	0	" She pulled Damien to her and kissed him . Her hands descended to his trousers and she tugged them down , then his shorts , so she could gaze at him unhindered . His florid erection was beating strongly in anticipation . She touched it and he drew away , just out of her reach . "
18265	18363	18199	18199	I	0	" he rasped . She looked into his eyes and felt something pass between them . Something that simmered in the heat . Something intense . He tenderly stroked her cheek . She closed her eyes and reveled in his soft , sure touch . The movement was so delicate , so sweet . Almost loving . Damien lifted Abbey off the couch , unzipped her skirt and pulled it down over her legs and ankles . He sat back on his haunches beside the couch and let out a sigh as he gazed at her body . "
18370	18388	18368	18368	Abbey	42	" He stroked her calf , her thigh , brushed her moist lips with a teasing finger . "
18392	18432	18368	18368	Abbey	42	" he whispered . Abbey 's breathing turned heavy as that hand delicately explored , teased . A few more strokes and she would be lost in delicious torment , begging him to take her . But Damien stopped . "
18443	18524	18441	18441	Abbey	42	" His voice was low , intense and oh - so sensual . She obeyed . Something inside her wanted to do everything he asked her to do . For some reason she could n't fathom , she trusted him . Trusted that he was going to give her an experience she would not forget . She sat on the couch , facing the armrest . She felt the couch behind her move under his weight as he sat down . "
18531	18544	18528	18528	your	42	" She did as she was told , eager anticipation heating her . "
18563	18680	18556	18556	you	42	" Abbey wiggled backwards until she felt Damien 's knees . He was kneeling too , his legs together . She settled herself on his thighs , her legs on either side of his . His erection rose up between her back and his stomach . It pulsed quietly , the movement sending a shudder of anticipation through her . His left arm snaked around her , pinning her arm to her side . He touched her right breast , cupping its weight in his hand , massaging , up and around , until it was erect . A spasm shot from her breast to her inner thighs . Abbey sighed deeply and relaxed into him . "
18683	18779	18556	18556	you	42	" he murmured . His other hand came round her right side and lightly played along her thigh , moving inwards slowly . The sensation sent her skin tingling under his touch . His fingers gently parted her and caught the sensitive little knob . He tugged and she moaned . Her head rolled back onto his shoulder and he kissed her exposed neck lightly . With excruciating slowness , he rubbed her sensitive spot , up and down , and she fought back the urge to cry out , to let the orgasm come . "
18787	18794	18785	18785	Abbey	42	" he whispered into her ear . "
18800	18819	18796	18796	you	445	" She drew in a deep ragged breath and let it out slowly , trying to calm herself . "
18822	18866	18796	18796	you	445	" she muttered in a voice not her own . The sensations were beginning to swamp her , and no amount of deep breathing could stop her mounting climax . Then he stopped . What the Hell for ? She moaned in desperation . "
18873	18907	18868	18868	you	42	" he whispered again . She let out a small cry of protest at the tease , nodded quickly and wiggled against his hand . He moved it just out of her reach . "
18917	18940	18911	18911	I	0	" Abbey whimpered . Every pore of her body screamed for those fingers , wanted them to penetrate her , rub her . "
18949	19111	19112	19112	Abbey	42	" Just as she thought she could n't stand it any longer , the hand cupped her . Then one long finger entered her , withdrew , and entered again . His palm rubbed against her pulsing little nub . Picking up speed , he repeated the motion until the waves finally engulfed her , offering amazing relief as she rocked in time to his hand , arching her back , thrusting her breasts forwards as his left hand squeezed a tender nipple . Nick waited until Abbey 's shuddering ceased . He kissed her neck while he waited , breathing in her heady scent . She was incredible , the way she moved , the way she responded with complete abandon , utter trust and raw emotion . He waited until he could wait no more . The movement of her back against his erection had sent his pulse rate rising and he was almost ready to explode between them . "
19114	19118	19121	19121	Abbey	42	" he whispered , "
19123	19154	19121	19121	Abbey	42	" He could n't stop saying her name . He loved the way it sounded . He loved the way her skin formed little bumps every time he said it . "
19157	19166	19155	19155	Damien	45	" He placed a finger over her lips . "
19173	19178	19155	19155	Damien	45	" he said huskily . "
19185	19336	19337	19337	Abbey	42	" She nodded , confusion in her eyes , but she did n't question him . Instead , she licked the finger at her lips , sucking it into her mouth . Then she took charge . She pushed him back onto the couch , then knelt above him , lowering herself . A deep groan emanated from his throat as she touched his throbbing tip . His eyes watched her as she settled down on him , then bulged as she swallowed him whole inside her . She was hot and wet and just the feel of her sucking him into her slickness brought him quickly to the edge . She leaned forward , her hands beside his head on the couch and pumped him hard . Then just as he thought he was going to explode inside her , she stopped . She smiled wickedly down at him . "
19339	19343	19337	19337	Abbey	42	" he croaked . "
19350	19372	19155	19155	Damien	45	" He thrust his hips up to meet her , but she moved , just enough so he could n't reach . "
19378	19393	19374	19374	you	446	" she asked with a sly grin . He closed his eyes and nodded . "
19401	19634	19397	19397	Abbey	42	" What was she doing ? This was torture . If she was trying to pay him back for teasing her the same way a moment ago , then it was working . Unable to stand it any longer , he took her hips in his hands , then thrust upwards again , a mighty effort that made her gasp as he lunged deep inside her . She pumped him , long and hard , and a moment later he felt her shudder . It sent him to the edge again and over it . Wave upon wave crashed into him as Abbey 's body became limp and flopped on top of him , her arms snaking around his neck . She kissed him feverishly as he climaxed into her . He pushed his hands through her hair and kissed her back . * * * An hour later , Nick awoke and brushed Abbey 's hair from her face . She still lay on top of him , her weight pressing into his arms and chest . He did n't want her to move . She felt good snuggled into him . Comfortable . Abbey stirred . She lifted her head up and blinked down and smiled the electric smile that had him hooked . He grinned back . He could n't help it . She had that affect on him . "
19640	19667	19637	19638	Sleepy Head	55	" he said , catching the bulk of her hair in one hand and holding it off her face so he could see her beautiful eyes . "
19673	19674	19755	19755	I	0	" "
19678	19679	19755	19755	I	0	" "
19685	19696	19755	19755	I	0	" She tried to get up but he held her . "
19701	19723	19755	19755	I	0	" he murmured . She looked at him through drowsy eyes , then settled back onto his chest with a sigh . "
19731	19735	19724	19724	We	447	" he said . "
19745	19754	19755	19755	I	0	" Abbey sat up , shaking her head . "
19768	19795	19796	19796	Lucy	43	" Nick frowned . What friend ? He felt a small stab in the base of his stomach . Not Tarken , the idiot from dinner ? "
19798	19815	19796	19796	Lucy	43	" she said , as if reading his thoughts . She glanced over at the window . "
19823	19824	19816	19816	She	449	" "
19827	19952	19816	19816	She	449	" He extricated himself from her and stood . Fool . Do n't forget who she is . What she is . She 'd replaced one pimp with another , a woman this time . And he was an idiot to have forgotten what the arrangement was . He 'd been carried away in the heat of the moment , the passion , thinking this was more than it actually was . But it was sex . Just sex . He looked down at Abbey . She was already dressed in her bra and skirt and she was holding her torn thong , a piece in each hand . She glanced up at him , her eyes glistening , a smile twitching her lips . "
19961	20089	19954	19954	I	0	" Nick 's first instinct was to smile back at her , but he shoved any thoughts of humor from his mind . She was hinting that she needed more money than just two nights worth . Or was it three , since they 'd actually done it three times now ? He bent , picked up his pants and pulled the wallet out of the back pocket . He opened it and glanced down at Abbey as she sat on the couch . Her blue eyes stared back at him expectantly . He turned away . He could n't look at her , not when she pulled that innocent face on him . It was all he could do to stop himself from kissing her again . "
20093	20117	19954	19954	I	0	" She did n't say anything , so he was forced to look at her . Her eyes narrowed and her brow puckered . "
20124	20136	20120	20120	you	450	" she asked . Nick took out a hundred dollar note . "
20152	20252	20120	20120	you	450	" His voice sounded angry , even to him , but that was too bad . It was how he felt . Cheated somehow , but he was n't sure why . Abbey 's jaw dropped and her eyes suddenly widened to the size of satellite dishes . She stood , fully clothed now , and glared back at him . He suddenly felt very ill , sickened by what he 'd done . This was not like him . He 'd never done anything so drastic and so foolish in his life . He did not like it . "
20256	20324	20120	20120	you	450	" he asked gruffly . He was peering into his wallet so he did n't see the hand coming . Her slap stung his cheek . His head snapped up and he resisted the urge to grab her hand to stop her doing it again . It was n't dignified . Whatever was wrong , he could sort it out with some clear level - headed thinking . "
20332	20358	20120	20120	you	450	" he shouted . Fuck level - headedness . Nick Delaware had never been slapped in his life , and certainly not by a hooker ! "
20369	20385	20386	20386	Abbey	42	" She turned away and rounded the couch . She was heading toward the door . "
20388	20403	20386	20386	Abbey	42	" She did n't stop . Nick ran after her and grabbed her arm . "
20411	20412	20404	20404	Abbey	42	" "
20444	20454	20442	20442	I	0	" Nick blinked down at her . He shrugged . "
20476	20521	20522	20522	Abbey	42	" This time he saw the slap coming and he caught her hand . She tried to pull free but he held her firmly . Their eyes locked in unspoken battle . After glaring at each other for several heartbeats , he let go . "
20532	20533	20534	20534	You	42	" "
20544	20551	20542	20542	Damien	45	" Nick flinched at the name . "
20570	20583	20562	20562	you	0	" Abbey shook her head and flung her arms in the air . "
20605	20617	20622	20622	you	0	" Nick took a step back and drew his brows together . "
20625	20746	20747	20747	Abbey	42	" She turned away so he could n't see her face . She took a step toward the door , but there was no way he was going to let her go after that revelation without an explanation . He caught her arm . He thought he had the situation all figured out . He thought he had Abbey all figured out , but now nothing was what it seemed anymore . And he was a man who liked everything out in the open . No surprises , no secrets . He wanted to know who he was dealing with at all times , and that included now , with Abbey . If that was in fact her real name . "
20749	20760	20747	20747	Abbey	42	" he said softly . He drew her to him . "
20768	20769	20762	20762	you	42	" "
20775	20779	20762	20762	you	42	" Nick nodded . "
20791	20806	20808	20808	me	0	" Abbey shook her head and Nick felt his blood begin to heat up . "
20810	20811	20808	20808	me	0	" "
20819	20820	20812	20812	You	0	" "
20827	20855	20812	20812	You	0	" I 've just slept with you — more than once — I think I have a right to know who , and what , you are . "
20856	20864	20865	20865	she	42	" We agreed this was just sex , "
20880	20891	20871	20871	She	42	" No strings attached . Two consenting adults . Remember ? "
21004	21007	21008	21008	he	0	" Yeah , "
21012	21026	21008	21008	he	0	" It was just sex . Is that what you wanted to hear ? "
21098	21107	21108	21108	He	0	" Let me out or I 'll scream . "
21114	21118	21108	21108	He	0	" Go ahead . "
21244	21306	21307	21307	She	42	" You 're an asshole , do you know that ? You think everyone should bow to your whim , especially women . Well , I 've got news for you , Buddy . I hate arrogant men . You ca n't order people around and you ca n't make women do what you want them to do with a kiss . "
21342	21345	21346	21346	he	49	" Abbey , "
21350	21355	21346	21346	he	49	" do n't go . "
21361	21383	21384	21384	She	42	" And do n't think that a few gently spoken words are going to work either , because they do n't . "
21387	21393	21384	21384	She	42	" Not on me anyway . "
21441	21468	21469	21469	She	42	" Just tell me one thing . If you 're not a hooker , then why did you come to my room in the first place ? "
21491	21500	21501	21501	She	42	" Free massage , complements of hotel management . "
21583	21589	21590	21590	Lucy	43	" This is really hot , "
21599	21619	21596	21596	her	43	" We could put this stuff up on the Web and make a fortune at a dollar a peep . "
21620	21624	21625	21625	Abbey	42	" Very funny . "
21685	21730	21679	21679	her	43	" Look , Abbey , do n't get upset over what this guy said . It was bound to happen considering the circumstances . He 's a jerk and you 're not a hooker . Forget about it . He 's not worth it . "
21731	21749	21679	21679	her	43	" Easier said than done . It 's not everyday I get accused of being a prostitute . "
21790	21855	21784	21784	she	42	" Well , what did you expect ? You were dressed like a hooker , you entered his apartment with a flimsy excuse and you jumped him within five seconds . I think it was a pretty darn natural thing for him to assume given the circumstances . I still think you should 've taken the money . Three hundred will pay the rent . "
21856	21867	21784	21784	she	42	" Lucy ! I will not take money for sex ! "
21868	21871	21872	21872	She	42	" No . "
21883	21896	21872	21872	She	42	" But you 'll take money to create the illusion of it . "
21897	21902	21784	21784	she	42	" That 's different . "
21903	21964	21784	21784	she	42	" If believing that makes you happy , then go ahead and think it , Abbey Girl . It sure does n't worry me what anyone thinks about this whole thing . As soon as I get these processed , I 'll send them up to your lover 's wife and cash in . That 's all I care about . "
21965	21972	21973	21973	Abbey	42	" You 're cheaper than me , "
22027	22035	22036	22036	she	42	" And he 's not my lover , "
22039	22084	22036	22036	she	42	" Well , technically he was , but not any more . I 'm not going anywhere near Le Meridian , or even Collins Street for that matter , until he 's left . I may be poor but I 've got my pride . "
22085	22090	22091	22091	Lucy	43	" Good for you . "
22098	22117	22091	22091	Lucy	43	" You know , if you 'd taken that money , we could be sipping cocktails about now . "
22134	22189	22118	22118	Abbey	42	" Stop reminding me about the money . After the crap I heard come out of that arrogant jerk 's mouth , I probably should 've taken it . The guy 's attitude is stuck in the Nineteen Eighties . I do n't think the word ' sensitive ' is even in his vocabulary . "
22190	22197	22198	22198	Lucy	43	" Pity I was n't there , "
22207	22223	22198	22198	Lucy	43	" I would 've given him a talking to about how to treat a lady . "
22224	22239	22240	22240	Abbey	42	" And he 'd turn around and tell you I was n't a lady . "
22334	22343	22344	22344	Abbey	42	" Vane by name , vain by nature , "
22347	22389	22344	22344	Abbey	42	" Now , now , leave the poor guy alone . I think you just confused the hell out of him . He obviously needed to get laid and you just happened to be conveniently on his doorstep at the time . "
22390	22394	22405	22405	She	43	" Lucky me . "
22395	22404	22405	22405	She	43	" Hey , now I like this one . "
22413	22470	22405	22405	She	43	" It 's quite artistic , if I do say so myself . I think we 'll send Mrs. Vane this one . It does n't show your face , so your anonymity will be preserved , but it has a great shot of him at the moment of truth . Here , have a look . "
22524	22572	22573	22573	Lucy	43	" No , I do n't want to see them . I do n't want to be reminded of my stupidity , okay ? And I wish you would n't study those so closely . It 's bad enough knowing you saw everything when it actually happened . "
22576	22603	22604	22604	Abbey	42	" Do n't worry , Abbey Girl . I only saw up to the moment when you got dressed . I did n't see the slap . "
22607	22624	22625	22625	Lucy	43	" You know what I mean . Did you really have to watch the whole thing ? "
22628	22655	22625	22625	Lucy	43	" Hell yes ! It was fantastic ! My own private porno movie . And this camera 's a beauty . I zoomed in real close — "
22656	22659	22660	22660	Lucy	43	" Lucy ! "
22871	22880	22881	22881	She	43	" Richmond P.I. How can I help you ? "
22895	22900	22881	22881	She	43	" Who is it ? "
22901	22918	22919	22919	Abbey	42	" Tarken . Tell him where to go so we can go out for a drink . "
22929	22937	22919	22919	Abbey	42	" What do you want , Tarken ? "
22938	22966	22967	22967	Tarken	46	" First of all , you can tell that slutty friend of yours that I 'm not going anywhere until we 've sorted everything out , Abbey . "
22972	22986	22967	22967	Tarken	46	" I mean that . I want you back . I need you . "
22996	23004	22987	22987	Abbey	42	" Office in chaos , is it ? "
23020	23054	23011	23011	him	46	" Now , why do you think that ? No , I just want you , you fool . I love you . I made a mistake with Melinda , a huge mistake . "
23055	23123	22987	22987	Abbey	42	" Too late , Tarken . A lot 's changed in two days , and I would n't take you back if you paid me . And I 'm so poor , that 's not a statement you should take lightly . Got it ? Now , unless there 's something else , I 'm going . I 've got some serious drinking to do with Lucy . "
23124	23133	23177	23177	He	46	" Wait ! Abbey , do n't go . "
23134	23154	23155	23155	Tarken	46	" Tarken , I 'm busy . I 'm helping Lucy with a big case she 's working on . "
23214	23225	23226	23226	he	46	" Who was that guy you were with last night ? "
23285	23291	23292	23292	she	42	" None of your business , "
23298	23305	23292	23292	she	42	" He reminds me of somebody ... "
23306	23318	23345	23345	Abbey	42	" Well , that 's nice to know . Good bye . "
23319	23326	23292	23292	she	42	" Wait ! One more thing . "
23327	23330	23292	23292	she	42	" Yes ? "
23331	23344	23345	23345	Abbey	42	" That report by Driscoll — what would it be filed under ? "
23351	23364	23365	23365	she	42	" How did you ever let me go out with that creep ? "
23375	23395	23369	23369	Lucy	43	" I did n't , remember ? You insisted . You know , you should listen to me more . "
23396	23417	23369	23369	Lucy	43	" I should listen to you less . That way I would n't be in this mess with Damien Vane . "
23418	23429	23430	23430	Lucy	43	" What mess ? I do n't see a mess . "
23448	23480	23481	23481	Abbey	42	" All I see is a woman and man having great sex together . Leave it at that , Abbey . Forget about him now . We got what we wanted . "
23484	23496	23481	23481	Abbey	42	" Yeah , I 'm over - reacting , I know . "
23497	23505	23430	23430	Lucy	43	" You always were the sentimental one . "
23506	23517	23518	23518	Lucy	43	" I 'm surprised you even know that word exists . "
23521	23530	23518	23518	Lucy	43	" Do n't ask me to spell it . "
23540	23544	23546	23546	Lucy	43	" Come on , "
23548	23556	23546	23546	Lucy	43	" lets go out for a drink . "
23557	23565	23518	23518	Lucy	43	" How are we going to pay ? "
23566	23579	23546	23546	Lucy	43	" I 've got a little left over from the last job . "
23580	23587	23588	23588	Abbey	42	" But you might need it , "
23594	23623	23591	23591	Lucy	43	" We 'll get the money from the Vane job soon , so do n't sweat it . There 's enough to last . It 's only money . "
23634	23665	23666	23666	Lucy	43	" Tomorrow I 'm going to hit the interview path hard . And when I get a job I 'm going to buy you drinks every night for a week . "
23669	23675	23676	23676	She	43	" Sounds good to me . "
23871	23878	23880	23880	Lucy	43	" We 'll take my car , "
23882	23893	23894	23894	Abbey	42	" Days like this call for little sexy sports cars . "
23923	23931	23932	23932	Abbey	42	" Let 's go to St. Kilda , "
23935	23955	23932	23932	Abbey	42	" Great idea . We 'll go for a swim then head to the Stoke House for a drink . "
24514	24516	24538	24540	the bald director	527	" massages "
25195	25198	25199	25199	he	49	" Hello , "
25226	25235	25211	25211	her	42	" Damien ! What are you doing here ? "
25362	25377	25360	25360	him	49	" Taking the afternoon off . Looks like you decided to do the same . "
25378	25381	25382	25382	Abbey	42	" What ? "
25393	25406	25382	25382	Abbey	42	" Oh , I do n't start at the hotel until later . "
25407	25410	25412	25412	she	42	" Right . "
25459	25463	25464	25464	she	42	" Very nice , "
25480	25483	25484	25484	he	49	" Look , "
25489	25506	25484	25484	he	49	" I 'd like to talk to Abbey alone , so if you would n't mind ... "
25507	25511	25513	25513	Abbey	42	" I mind ! "
25575	25578	25579	25579	he	49	" Abbey , "
25582	25591	25579	25579	he	49	" I want to talk to you privately . "
25592	25610	25635	25635	Lucy	43	" Lucy can hear whatever you want to say . We have no secrets from each other . "
25611	25616	25618	25618	Lucy	43	" Not any more , "
25623	25631	25620	25620	Nick	49	" What 's that supposed to mean ? "
25643	25651	25652	25652	she	43	" Just that Abbey tells me everything , "
25655	25659	25652	25652	she	43	" Big Boy . "
25665	25668	25669	25669	Abbey	42	" Lucy ! "
25825	25828	25829	25829	he	49	" Okay , "
25832	25848	25829	25829	he	49	" I 'll tell you what I want to tell you in front of her . "
25860	25874	25857	25857	She	42	" I wanted to tell you I enjoyed last night . Very much . "
25916	25941	25908	25908	Nick	49	" Abbey , please can we talk in private ? What I want to say to you should n't be heard by anyone else . "
25942	25952	25954	25954	Lucy	43	" Do n't worry about me , Mr. Vane , "
25956	25967	25954	25954	Lucy	43	" Like I said , Abbey and I share everything . "
25968	25971	25972	25972	Abbey	42	" Lucy ! "
26033	26037	26039	26039	Abbey	42	" Say it , "
26104	26107	26108	26108	he	49	" Abbey , "
26129	26136	26139	26139	he	49	" Abbey , I 'm sorry . "
26148	26152	26139	26139	he	49	" That it ? "
26156	26159	26160	26160	She	42	" Good . "
26176	26181	26182	26182	He	49	" Abbey , wait ! "
26215	26236	26211	26211	He	49	" What do you want , Damien ? I 've had enough of these games , and Lucy 's waiting . "
26237	26246	26247	26247	He	49	" This is n't a game , Abbey . "
26261	26296	26297	26297	He	49	" I really am sorry for what I called you . It was rude and I was out of line . It 's just that I did n't know ... I thought you were ... "
26300	26337	26297	26297	He	49	" Okay , I jumped to the wrong conclusion , despite all the evidence pointing to that conclusion . But I have to admit , your weird explanation is n't helping me to figure you out . "
26341	26346	26347	26347	she	42	" Figure what out ? "
26408	26429	26400	26400	Nick	49	" Figure out who you are ! What you want from me ! Why you came up to my room ! "
26430	26439	26440	26440	Nick	49	" And why I had sex with you ? "
26483	26486	26487	26487	She	42	" Abbey ? "
26497	26515	26491	26491	Her	42	" I 'm a masseur . I work for the hotel . That 's who I am . "
26516	26536	26491	26491	Her	42	" Damn it , Abbey , this is n't fair . I 'm trying to get to know you — "
26537	26540	26491	26491	Her	42	" Why ? "
26551	26557	26548	26548	He	49	" Because I like you . "
26599	26605	26606	26606	she	42	" It 's just sex , "
26648	26655	26656	26656	he	49	" Is that what you think ? "
26745	26749	26750	26750	she	42	" Do n't , "
26756	26766	26750	26750	she	42	" Why not ? I want you , Abbey . "
26787	26791	26792	26792	he	49	" Why not ? "
26796	26802	26792	26792	he	49	" Because of last night . "
26803	26816	26767	26767	She	42	" I said I was sorry . What more do you want ? "
26817	26827	26854	26854	She	42	" Do you still think I 'm a hooker ? "
26828	26831	26832	26832	Nick	49	" No . "
26914	26922	26910	26910	Abbey	42	" This is getting out of control . "
26928	26959	26923	26923	Nick	49	" It is ? I thought we were just two consenting adults , enjoying each other 's company . No strings attached , like you said . Am I wrong ? "
26987	26990	26976	26976	her	42	" No . "
26998	27008	27009	27009	she	42	" You 're not wrong . Two consenting adults , "
27131	27135	27136	27136	she	42	" Not here , "
27139	27142	27136	27136	she	42	" Okay . "
27181	27187	27176	27176	She	42	" Where are we going ? "
27201	27211	27188	27188	He	49	" Far enough out for privacy . Total privacy . "
27220	27223	27212	27212	Her	42	" Why ? "
27224	27229	27230	27230	he	49	" You know why , "
27233	27237	27238	27238	she	42	" Tell me , "
27242	27265	27238	27238	she	42	" Because I 'm going to make love to you in the water , in front of a beach full of people . "
27339	27348	27349	27349	He	45	" You 're not kidding , are you ? "
27363	27378	27359	27359	He	45	" Just a little further . But it 'll probably be over your head . "
27387	27391	27379	27379	He	45	" Hold on . "
27621	27628	27629	27629	he	45	" This will have to do , "
27632	27640	27629	27629	he	45	" I ca n't wait any longer . "
27641	27645	27646	27646	He	45	" Neither can I. "
27809	27812	27813	27813	he	45	" Abbey , "
27816	27826	27813	27813	he	45	" I want you , Abbey . So much . "
28045	28048	28049	28049	she	42	" Yes , "
28106	28109	28110	28110	he	45	" Now , "
28207	28218	28202	28202	his	45	" Abbey . Yes , yes ... oh , yes . "
28374	28381	28382	28382	she	42	" No , do n't stop , "
28619	28625	28626	28626	she	42	" We should get back , "
28629	28634	28626	28626	she	42	" Before anyone notices . "
28664	28669	28670	28670	he	45	" Uh , Abbey , "
28688	28691	28673	28673	He	45	" Hmmm ? "
28692	28697	28698	28698	She	42	" About last night ... "
28725	28729	28730	28730	she	42	" I know , "
28733	28742	28730	28730	she	42	" you 're sorry . I forgive you . "
28747	28750	28730	28730	she	42	" Really ? "
28751	28772	28773	28773	He	45	" Do n't sound so surprised . Yes , I do , but let 's drop the subject , okay ? "
28781	28797	28798	28798	She	42	" Abbey , I want to see you again . Tonight , tomorrow , Friday — "
28806	28821	28798	28798	She	42	" Do n't say anymore . Do n't make promises you ca n't keep . "
28832	28838	28829	28829	his	45	" I never do that . "
29348	29353	29354	29354	he	120	" Are you okay ? "
29361	29364	29358	29358	She	42	" Sure . "
29371	29379	29365	29365	He	120	" So will I see you again ? "
29380	29383	29384	29384	He	120	" Maybe . "
29388	29392	29384	29384	He	120	" I see . "
29676	29680	29681	29681	he	45	" I see , "
29743	29749	29750	29750	Lucy	43	" You two back already ? "
29761	29770	29750	29750	Lucy	43	" I was hoping you 'd take longer . "
29771	29777	29779	29779	Abbey	42	" I want to go , "
29782	29794	29779	29779	Abbey	42	" Well , I was thinking of hanging around a bit . "
29795	29798	29800	29801	the gorilla	620	" Yeah , "
29803	29822	29823	29823	Lucy	43	" Why do n't you two go get yourselves a drink and I 'll meet you somewhere later , "
29826	29829	29831	29832	the gorilla	620	" Yeah , "
29834	29838	29840	29840	Damien	45	" Why not ? "
29842	29849	29840	29840	Damien	45	" I saw a nice bar — "
29850	29853	29854	29854	Abbey	42	" No ! "
29904	29928	29894	29894	Lucy	43	" Sorry , Abbey Girl , I got a bit carried away . Wherever you want to go , we 'll go there . "
29935	29942	29894	29894	Lucy	43	" I want to go home . "
29943	29998	29999	29999	she	42	" Sure thing . I 'm sorry . I thought you and Vane were getting on fine . It looked like it from where I was sitting . I started getting antsy while I watched so when that guy came over I thought I 'd fill in some time talking to him . Well , "
30002	30016	29999	29999	she	42	" not really talking . The guy ca n't string two words together . "
30490	30499	30500	30500	she	638	" May I help you , Mr. Vane ? "
30503	30506	30507	30507	Nick	49	" Yes . "
30561	30564	30565	30565	he	49	" Yes , "
30571	30587	30565	30565	he	49	" There 's a girl who , um , may or may not work here . "
30588	30591	30593	30594	the woman	178	" Yes ? "
30625	30639	30612	30612	her	178	" Her name 's Abbey . I do n't know her last name . "
30640	30653	30680	30680	her	59	" I do n't know any Abbeys . Is she in housekeeping ? "
30654	30667	30680	30680	her	59	" Um , no . At least I do n't think so . "
30668	30673	30612	30612	her	178	" Right . Reception ? "
30674	30677	30678	30678	Belinda	59	" No . "
30687	30690	30678	30678	Belinda	59	" Well ? "
30691	30697	30612	30612	her	178	" She 's a masseur . "
30698	30702	30708	30708	her	59	" A masseur ? "
30711	30719	30680	30680	her	59	" She gives massages to your guests . "
30736	30751	30753	30753	Belinda	59	" I do n't think we offer that kind of service to our guests , "
30765	30771	30753	30753	Belinda	59	" Is your manager here ? "
30772	30796	30797	30797	Belinda	59	" No . But I 'm sure we can clear this up without involving him . What sort of massages does she give ? "
30815	30826	30812	30812	his	49	" The usual kind . Not … the other sort . "
30836	30840	30812	30812	his	49	" Other sort ? "
30841	30847	30848	30848	Nick	49	" Yes , you know . "
30856	30871	30850	30850	his	49	" The other sort . The sort you do n't tell your wife about . "
30877	30916	30872	30872	Belinda	59	" Of course . Let me get this straight . You 're after an employee named Abbey who gives massages , but not the kind of massage you ca n't tell your wife about . Is that it ? "
30917	30922	30812	30812	his	49	" More or less . "
30923	30972	30872	30872	Belinda	59	" Mr. Vane , I think I can say on behalf of Le Meridian that we do n't offer massages of any kind . However , if a woman is posing as hotel staff and charging for massages , of a kind you can tell your wife about — "
30973	30979	30812	30812	his	49	" She does n't charge . "
30986	30990	30980	30980	Belinda	59	" Free massages ? "
30991	30999	30872	30872	Belinda	59	" Yes . Compliments of hotel management . "
31000	31012	30872	30872	Belinda	59	" I think there 's been a mistake , Mr. Vane . "
31013	31026	31027	31027	Nick	49	" So do I. I 'm sorry I took up your time . "
31046	31052	31053	31053	He	49	" Ah , Mr. Vane . "
31065	31068	31069	31069	She	59	" What ? "
31092	31111	31112	31112	She	59	" If you need a massage , I 'm sure we can arrange one . Of either kind . "
31123	31126	31127	31127	He	49	" Thanks . "
31286	31294	31296	31296	Lucy	43	" Forget about him , Abbey Girl , "
31316	31347	31306	31306	She	43	" He 's an S.O.B. He ca n't keep it in his pants , and you just happen to be the lucky girl in Melbourne . Or the unlucky one . "
31351	31356	31357	31357	She	42	" I know that . "
31569	31575	31576	31576	Abbey	42	" What 's so funny ? "
31579	31589	31590	31590	Lucy	43	" Just thinking about last night at the restaurant . "
31601	31617	31618	31618	Abbey	42	" Bet he 'll never be able to dine out again without thinking of you . "
31621	31627	31618	31618	Abbey	42	" That could get embarrassing . "
31628	31631	31632	31632	Abbey	42	" Good . "
31636	31641	31642	31642	Lucy	43	" Forget about him , "
31645	31657	31642	31642	Lucy	43	" The guy 's a creep . You deserve someone better . "
31658	31662	31663	31663	Lucy	43	" Do I ? "
31678	31713	31663	31663	Lucy	43	" Of course you do . And you 'll find him one day . A guy who 's programmed not to cheat on his wife . A guy who 's not an arrogant pig . "
31714	31719	31720	31720	Lucy	43	" Do they exist ? "
31723	31736	31720	31720	Lucy	43	" I 'm hardly the girl to answer that now , am I. "
31742	31756	31737	31737	Abbey	42	" I 've been really stupid , this time , have n't I ? "
31757	31772	31663	31663	Lucy	43	" This time ? Nah . You 've done some far more stupid things . "
31773	31783	31663	31663	Lucy	43	" Like putting up with Tarken for two years ? "
31784	31808	31809	31809	Abbey	42	" Yeah . Wonder what he 's doing now that he 's lost the only person who knows how to run that office ? "
31812	31817	31809	31809	Abbey	42	" Hopefully getting fired . "
31818	31825	31826	31826	Abbey	42	" Hopefully getting dumped by Melinda . "
31831	31853	31826	31826	Abbey	42	" She would n't . She 's too nice . Poor girl . She does n't know what he 's like . "
31854	31861	31862	31862	Abbey	42	" Neither did you , remember ? "
31865	31882	31862	31862	Abbey	42	" You 're right , and I should listen to you more , oh Wise Woman . "
31894	31928	31929	31929	Abbey	42	" That 's right . You should . And this Wise Woman is telling you to forget about Damien Vane , and get back into your life . Go get yourself a job . "
31932	31937	31929	31929	Abbey	42	" Yes , Ma'am . "
31938	31946	31948	31948	Lucy	43	" I mean it , Abbey Girl , "
31955	31995	31948	31948	Lucy	43	" Damien 's a jerk . Guys who cheat on their wives always are . You need to treat them the way they treat women — like they 're not important . It 's the only way they learn . "
32024	32038	32039	32039	she	42	" I should n't have had sex with him in the water today , "
32042	32059	32039	32039	she	42	" I was n't going to , but the heat of the moment just took over . "
32063	32092	32060	32060	Lucy	43	" No you should n't have , but you 're one up on me . I 've never done it in front of a beach full of people . "
32099	32104	32105	32105	Lucy	43	" Did anyone notice ? "
32110	32138	32107	32107	her	43	" Just me . And boy , was I getting turned on watching you two . I was ready to drag that guy off when you returned . "
32144	32149	32150	32150	she	42	" You 're impossible , "
32153	32174	32150	32150	she	42	" And you can do better than that gorilla . The guy had muscles where there should n't be any . "
32180	32208	32209	32209	She	42	" Seriously Abbey , maybe you should n't have had sex with Vane today , but what 's done is done . Now just forget about him . "
32216	32239	32209	32209	She	42	" Once you get a job you 'll feel more like yourself and you 'll realize what an idiot you 've been . "
32240	32245	32253	32253	she	43	" Gee , thanks . "
32246	32250	32253	32253	she	43	" Any time . "
32327	32336	32319	32319	she	42	" That was the gorilla from the beach . "
32337	32344	32319	32319	she	42	" You gave him your number ? "
32345	32358	32319	32319	she	42	" Sure , why not . He wants to see me tonight . "
32359	32364	32365	32365	Lucy	43	" Are you going ? "
32368	32380	32381	32381	Lucy	43	" Go on , off you go . I 'm fine . "
32386	32421	32381	32381	Lucy	43	" I 'm not leaving you . You need a friend right now . Besides , I do n't know if I liked him all that much , now that I think about it . "
32422	32432	32433	32433	Lucy	43	" Since when did you have to like them ? "
32436	32447	32433	32433	Lucy	43	" Maybe you 're beginning to rub off on me . "
32448	32491	32319	32319	she	42	" I wish you 'd rub off on me . I wish I could just have meaningless sex and not get emotionally involved . A few days ago I thought I could but it seems I 'm just not wired that way . "
32492	32555	32556	32556	Abbey	42	" That 's because you 're doing it wrong . You need to pick a guy you have absolutely no interest in . Someone like the gorilla whose vocabulary consists of monosyllabic words only . That way there 's no danger of getting emotionally involved because the only emotion he can express involves sex and beer . Possibly at the same time . "
32559	32579	32556	32556	Abbey	42	" Hey , I 've got an idea . How about I hook you up with one of mine ? "
32580	32590	32591	32591	Abbey	42	" That 's very generous of you , Lucy , "
32598	32606	32591	32591	Abbey	42	" but I do n't think so . "
32607	32611	32612	32612	Lucy	43	" Why not ? "
32633	32665	32666	32666	Abbey	42	" How about Mick the plumber ? His hands are rough , but he 's got a large dick . And as an added bonus , he 'll unclog your sink . "
32669	32673	32666	32666	Abbey	42	" No thanks . "
32674	32719	32612	32612	Lucy	43	" Okay , what about Lance ? Sensitive new age guy . He recites poetry when he 's climaxing . Actually , on second thoughts , he 's not a good idea . The last thing you need right now is a sensitive man . "
32720	32731	32666	32666	Abbey	42	" I do n't need any man , thank you . "
32732	32812	32813	32813	Lucy	43	" Do n't be silly . Listen to me — I know you better than you know yourself . Okay , there 's a guy I met about a month ago at the races . He 's got a huge gambling problem so he ca n't buy you dinner , but he will give you a good tip . Or there 's Vaughn . Well hung , knows all the best moves and is as supple as a gymnast . "
32816	32831	32832	32832	Abbey	42	" On second thoughts , I think I 'll keep that one for myself . "
32835	32845	32832	32832	Abbey	42	" Stop it , Lucy , this is serious . "
32846	32879	32813	32813	Lucy	43	" I know ! Why do n't you take the gorilla ? You 're completely incompatible so he 'd be perfect . No chance you 'd fall for a moron like him . "
32880	32883	32884	32884	Lucy	43	" Lucy ! "
32890	32898	32884	32884	Lucy	43	" Okay , okay . I tried . "
32905	32920	32899	32899	Abbey	42	" Thanks , but I think I 'll wallow in self pity for awhile . "
33213	33223	33224	33224	he	65	" Excuse me , we 'd like a demonstration , "
33247	33256	33245	33245	Donaldson	65	" You ! What are you doing here ? "
33335	33342	33343	33344	the man	117	" My name is Damien Vane , "
33353	33362	33347	33347	He	117	" I believe we met the other night . "
33425	33428	33430	33430	Tarken	46	" Yes , "
33436	33449	33450	33450	He	46	" I believe we did . Are you the Software Solutions representative ? "
33453	33458	33450	33450	He	46	" And you are ? "
33459	33485	33494	33494	He	45	" Tarken Pratt from JJC Pharmaceuticals . This is my associate , Max Donaldson . We 'd like to have a look at your application . "
33486	33489	33491	33491	Vane	45	" Certainly , "
33526	33545	33522	33522	Tarken	46	" Okay , I think we 've seen enough . Come on , Donaldson , let 's go . "
33546	33555	33557	33557	Donaldson	65	" But I 've got a million questions , "
33559	33568	33557	33557	Donaldson	65	" What operating systems can it run on ? "
33766	33778	33779	33779	Tarken	46	" Mr. Pratt , I 'd like to talk to you . "
33852	33858	33860	33860	Tarken	46	" Please call me Tarken , "
33862	33868	33860	33860	Tarken	46	" Is this about business ? "
33869	33872	33897	33897	Donaldson	65	" No . "
33873	33880	33881	33881	He	46	" I did n't think so . "
33886	33896	33881	33881	He	46	" I 'll meet you back at the office . "
33913	33918	33920	33920	Tarken	46	" Look , Vane , "
33927	33933	33924	33924	his	46	" Abbey 's my girlfriend . "
33934	33950	33881	33881	He	46	" She told me you broke up . You slept with a girl called Melinda . "
33951	33988	33924	33924	his	46	" That was a small misunderstanding . I 've realized I ca n't live without Abbey . I 've called her and explained and it 's only a matter of time before we 're back together . "
33989	33996	33924	33924	his	46	" I do n't think so . "
33997	34017	33881	33881	He	46	" You do n't think so ? And what 's my relationship with Abbey got to do with you ? "
34018	34026	34027	34028	The man	117	" That 's none of your business . "
34044	34061	34041	34041	his	46	" This conversation is getting nowhere . If you 've said all you want to say — "
34062	34067	34068	34068	Vane	45	" I have n't . "
34084	34094	34068	34068	Vane	45	" I wanted to ask you something about Abbey . "
34095	34110	34111	34111	Vane	45	" And what makes you think I 'll answer anything you want to know ? "
34120	34131	34111	34111	Vane	45	" Because something tells me you 're afraid of me . "
34140	34207	34137	34137	He	46	" I 'm not afraid of you . Why would I be ? In fact , you should be afraid of me . I 'm a potential customer . I could decide to not buy your software . I could decide to spread nasty rumors about how terrible your software is , and how much of an arrogant scumbag Software Solutions ' VP of Marketing is . "
34208	34212	34214	34214	Vane	45	" Go ahead , "
34216	34239	34240	34240	Tarken	46	" And while you 're at it do n't forget that I 'm a womanizing drunk . That detail is very important . "
34283	34287	34272	34272	he	120	" Go on . "
34288	34295	34296	34296	Tarken	46	" Where can I find Abbey ? "
34299	34307	34296	34296	Tarken	46	" You mean you do n't know ? "
34359	34374	34330	34330	he	45	" I wo n't give you her address . I do n't trust you . "
34382	34411	34412	34412	He	46	" Okay , okay . I 'll give you Lucy 's office address . That 's her best friend , in case you did n't know . Richmond P.I. "
34461	34471	34451	34451	He	46	" Richmond P.I. ? Lucy 's a private investigator ? "
34475	34488	34489	34489	Vane	45	" You really do n't know much about Abbey , do you ? "
34494	34499	34489	34489	Vane	45	" Tell me then . "
34514	34526	34527	34527	Vane	45	" She 's helping Lucy out on a case right now . "
34532	34538	34527	34527	Vane	45	" What sort of case ? "
34539	34545	34489	34489	Vane	45	" How should I know ? "
34546	34554	34555	34555	Tarken	46	" So you 're not her boyfriend ? "
34560	34594	34555	34555	Tarken	46	" Not since she found out about Melinda . But that 's over now , and I 'm going to get her back . So do n't get in my way , Vane . "
34616	34641	34642	34642	Vane	45	" I figure there 's not much money in Lucy 's line of work so in a few days Abbey will come crawling back . "
34667	34673	34659	34659	he	45	" You give her money ? "
34674	34704	34659	34659	he	45	" Well , yeah . Good money . She works pretty hard for it though . And I have to admit , she 's good at what she does . "
34752	34815	34816	34816	Vane	45	" I did n't really realize how good until she quit . Always the way though , is n't it ? You 're employees leave and you find no one else in the company knows how to do what they do . I 've advertised for a replacement , but so far the agency has n't come up with a suitable applicant . "
34846	34852	34837	34837	Vane	45	" She works for you ? "
34853	34861	34823	34823	Tarken	46	" That 's what I just said . "
34862	34868	34837	34837	Vane	45	" What does she do . "
34869	34875	34837	34837	Vane	45	" Nothing , she quit . "
34876	34883	34884	34884	Tarken	46	" Before she quit , Idiot . "
34887	34894	34884	34884	Tarken	46	" She was my personal assistant . "
34903	34907	34895	34895	Vane	45	" Personal assistant ? "
34991	35018	34987	34987	He	46	" Yeah , my P.A. Things are a little hectic since she left , but when I get her back , it 'll be okay again . "
35019	35030	35031	35031	Tarken	46	" And how will you get her back , Tarken ? "
35070	35078	35079	35079	He	46	" Offer her more money of course . "
35433	35436	35438	35439	the driver	725	" Richmond , "
35441	35457	35438	35439	the driver	725	" Good factory outlets and seconds shops if you 're looking for a new suit . "
35458	35462	35438	35439	the driver	725	" No thanks . "
35870	35875	35876	35876	he	49	" What you doing ? "
35879	35884	35876	35876	he	49	" Waiting for Lucy . "
35885	35895	35907	35908	The Neanderthal	51	" Looked like you were trying to break in . "
35896	35906	35907	35908	The Neanderthal	51	" Do I look like a burglar to you ? "
35915	35919	35907	35908	The Neanderthal	51	" Guess not . "
35920	35926	35927	35927	Nick	49	" Lucy 's a friend , "
35935	35943	35930	35931	The man	117	" She 's every man 's friend . "
35973	35997	35998	35998	he	117	" Just do n't let her give you that shit about being busy . That 's her kiss - off line . Besides , "
36005	36013	35998	35998	he	117	" she never looks busy to me . "
36732	36735	36741	36741	Lucy	43	" Hey , "
36744	36753	36741	36741	Lucy	43	" someone 's been tampering with my door . "
36975	36996	36970	36972	A chirpy receptionist	781	" This is Tarken Pratt from JJC Pharmaceuticals in Melbourne . I 'd like to speak to your CEO please . "
36997	37013	36970	36972	A chirpy receptionist	781	" Mr. Delaware is n't in the office today , can I take a message ? "
37014	37023	36970	36972	A chirpy receptionist	781	" Delaware ? Do you mean Nick Delaware ? "
37024	37039	36970	36972	A chirpy receptionist	781	" Yes . Is there anyone else here who can help you , sir ? "
37052	37063	36970	36972	A chirpy receptionist	781	" No . When 's Delaware back in the office ? "
37064	37067	37068	37068	He	46	" Monday . "
37210	37219	37221	37221	Melinda	47	" Mr. Goldstein 's for you , Tark , "
37253	37263	37264	37264	He	46	" You deal with him , I 'm busy . "
37378	37387	37371	37371	she	42	" What the hell is going on here ? "
37400	37409	37388	37388	she	42	" Damien ! What are you doing here ? "
37446	37453	37454	37454	he	46	" What the hell is this ? "
37483	37489	37490	37490	she	43	" None of your business , "
37529	37539	37541	37541	Vane	45	" I think it is very much my business , "
37543	37555	37541	37541	Vane	45	" considering I feature very prominently in your little happy snaps . "
37556	37564	37602	37602	His	45	" These do n't belong to you . "
37565	37578	37602	37602	His	45	" Let 's call the cops and find out , shall we ? "
37579	37601	37602	37602	His	45	" Yes , let 's . I 'm sure they 'll like to hear about how you broke into my office . "
37615	37626	37627	37627	Lucy	43	" Abbey , I want to discuss this with you . "
37630	37636	37627	37627	Lucy	43	" I 'm not leaving — "
37637	37644	37645	37645	Abbey	42	" Lucy , it 's okay , "
37648	37655	37645	37645	Abbey	42	" I can deal with him . "
37666	37683	37684	37684	She	43	" I know you can , but I 'll be just outside if you need me . "
37788	37795	37796	37796	she	42	" What are you doing here ? "
37806	37813	37799	37799	He	45	" I came to see you . "
37820	37827	37816	37816	her	42	" Well , here I am . "
37851	37864	37835	37835	he	45	" I came to find out what the hell was going on . "
37930	37946	37947	37947	She	42	" You must have a fair idea since you 're here and saw those photos . "
37960	37968	37955	37955	He	45	" Why did you lie to me ? "
37983	37991	37969	37969	He	45	" Is it to do with those ? "
38152	38156	38157	38157	he	45	" Tell me , "
38179	38184	38185	38185	She	42	" Let me go ! "
38624	38629	38630	38630	he	45	" Oh , Abbey , "
39022	39027	39016	39016	He	49	" What 's wrong ? "
39039	39053	39054	39054	She	42	" You know what 's wrong . This whole damn thing is wrong . "
39141	39144	39145	39145	he	49	" Abbey , "
39157	39175	39145	39145	he	49	" No ! I ca n't keep on doing this , Damien . It 's too hard . "
39184	39188	39176	39176	He	49	" Very hard . "
39200	39212	39189	39189	He	49	" That 's not what I meant and you know it . "
39257	39268	39249	39249	He	49	" Abbey , I 'm sorry I got annoyed before — "
39269	39281	39234	39234	She	42	" Annoyed ! You looked like you were about to explode . "
39282	39298	39299	39299	His	49	" I have a quick temper . But it 's just as quick to disappear . "
39306	39312	39299	39299	His	49	" When I kiss you . "
39332	39336	39337	39337	she	42	" Do n't , "
39340	39347	39337	39337	she	42	" I ca n't do this . "
39348	39355	39356	39356	She	42	" We 're two consenting adults — "
39366	39417	39356	39356	She	42	" I 've heard that line a million times in the last few days and I do n't want to hear it anymore . Look , I do n't do casual sex with strangers very well . It 's not exactly in my makeup if you know what I mean . "
39474	39488	39459	39459	she	42	" No , I do n't know what you mean . Tell me . "
39530	39551	39525	39525	she	42	" I think I 'm the one who should be pissed here . You 've got photos of me naked . "
39552	39556	39525	39525	she	42	" And me . "
39557	39567	39568	39568	He	49	" No one knows it 's you except us . "
39575	39598	39568	39568	He	49	" And Lucy . And since she 's a P.I. I hate to think where those photos are going to end up . "
39603	39611	39599	39599	Abbey	42	" I ca n't tell you that . "
39612	39619	39620	39620	He	49	" I figured you would n't . "
39625	39653	39620	39620	He	49	" I also figure you 're not about to tell me what 's going on . And what role you 've been playing throughout this little game . "
39654	39663	39665	39665	she	42	" I have n't been playing any game . "
39706	39734	39682	39682	He	49	" If you 're not going to tell me what 's going on , then I 'm going to walk out that door and not turn back . "
40007	40011	40012	40012	he	49	" I see , "
40043	40046	40047	40047	Lucy	43	" Shit . "
40109	40121	40122	40122	she	42	" I 'm not going to let him get to me , "
40133	40139	40141	40141	Lucy	43	" Bit late for that , "
40152	40162	40147	40147	Abbey	42	" I 'll be fine . I 'm tough . "
40163	40176	40177	40177	Abbey	42	" Yeah , as tough as marshmallow when it comes to Vane . "
40180	40194	40177	40177	Abbey	42	" I should n't have let him get so close to me again . "
40236	40253	40222	40222	Lucy	43	" It 's partly my fault . I should n't have left you alone with him . "
40278	40284	40285	40285	she	42	" Sorry about the mess , "
40296	40317	40285	40285	she	42	" Do n't be . I should 've known better . He 's got some kind of hold on you . "
40318	40338	40285	40285	she	42	" He 's bad news , that 's what he is . I 've got to learn self control . "
40339	40386	40387	40387	Lucy	43	" Maybe you should take up judo . Martial arts are a great way to learn self - control . When you realize you can kick butt it takes a hell of a lot of self control not to . I 've got a great instructor . "
40390	40396	40387	40387	Lucy	43	" He 's really sexy . "
40397	40414	40435	40435	Lucy	43	" No thanks . It is n't necessary to kick butt in my line of work . "
40415	40429	40430	40430	Abbey	42	" I do n't know — Tarken needs a good butt - kicking . "
40466	40496	40458	40458	Lucy	43	" Forget about Vane . He 's a bastard . He 's also married and has a mistress in every port . You can do way better than him . "
40685	40691	40692	40692	she	42	" I 'm going home , "
40695	40701	40692	40692	she	42	" Sorry about your desk . "
40702	40733	40734	40734	She	42	" Abbey Girl , you can mess up my desk anytime . Just do n't fall in love with the next guy you have sex on it with , okay ? "
40746	40755	40757	40757	Abbey	42	" There wo n't be a next time , "
40759	40781	40757	40757	Abbey	42	" I 'm giving up on men . I ca n't pick a decent one if my life depended on it . "
40787	40816	40784	40784	her	43	" Do n't give up . Just do n't fall in love with them . I told you , pick a man whose personality totally turns you off . "
40826	40833	40817	40817	Her	43	" The gorilla 's still available . "
40839	40857	40817	40817	Her	43	" I 'm going before you set me up with every man in your little black book . "
40858	40871	40872	40872	Abbey	42	" That 'd keep you going for a few years at least . "
41389	41392	41385	41385	She	42	" Hello . "
41393	41398	41385	41385	She	42	" It 's Tarken . "
41454	41460	41450	41450	Tarken	46	" What do you want ? "
41461	41474	41429	41429	he	45	" Now , that 's no way to talk to your boyfriend . "
41475	41486	41429	41429	he	45	" Ex , Tarken . We 're through , remember ? "
41487	41505	41450	41450	Tarken	46	" Do n't be so hasty , I 've got something I want to say to you . "
41506	41519	41429	41429	he	45	" Well , hurry up and say it . I 'm busy . "
41550	41569	41570	41570	Abbey	42	" There 's a cocktail party on tomorrow night and I thought you might like to accompany me . "
41601	41610	41630	41630	Her	42	" Why would I want to do that ? "
41611	41629	41630	41630	Her	42	" Because it 's for this software seminar that 's been going on at the Crown Complex . "
41637	41644	41645	41645	she	42	" Did you go to it ? "
41648	41679	41645	41645	she	42	" Yes . Mr. Goldstein decided on Monday that we needed a new system . He suggested Donaldson go . Normally I 'd send you along with him , but ... "
41680	41689	41690	41690	She	42	" What , Melinda 's not good enough ? "
41700	41711	41690	41690	She	42	" Let 's just say that Melinda 's not you . "
41751	41763	41738	41738	She	42	" So why would I want to go to this party ? "
41764	41789	41790	41790	Abbey	42	" You might meet some industry contacts . Since you 're looking for a job , I thought it could prove useful for you . "
41928	41935	41944	41944	She	42	" Fine , I 'll go . "
41936	41943	41944	41944	She	42	" Pick you up at six . "
42722	42727	42729	42734	the man in an American drawl	851	" Hello , Boss , "
42736	42742	42729	42734	the man in an American drawl	851	" Long time no see . "
42743	42754	42729	42734	the man in an American drawl	851	" Vane ! What the hell are you doing here ? "
42755	42759	42760	42761	Damien Vane	45	" My job . "
42775	42786	42760	42761	Damien Vane	45	" Nice suite . Pity I could n't use it . "
42801	42819	42796	42799	his VP of Marketing	285	" You 've got some nerve waltzing in here now . Where the hell have you been ? "
42836	42845	42830	42830	He	45	" Sorry , I lost track of time . "
42846	42864	42796	42799	his VP of Marketing	285	" You lost track of time ! What kind of excuse is that ! You 're fired . "
42865	42963	42964	42964	He	854	" Aw , now wait a minute , let me explain . I went away for the weekend with this hot little air hostess . An air hostess ! I could n't pass her up . Well , we kind of had a few too many drinks on Sunday night , then the next thing I knew it was Wednesday . I got back to the office as quick as I could and they said you 'd come down here instead of me . So I got Beverly to book me a flight and here I am . "
42971	42983	42964	42964	He	854	" Better late than never . And there 's still tomorrow . "
43002	43017	43018	43018	He	49	" You 've a nerve coming down here when the seminar 's almost over . "
43068	43140	43141	43141	Vane	45	" I 've had enough of your disappearances and your lazy attitude to the job . I 've put up with it until now because you were supposed to be the best . But you crossed the line this time , Vane . You 're fired . Get out of this room , go back to Sydney and clean out your office . I do n't want to see you again . "
43151	43156	43147	43147	his	45	" You 're serious . "
43157	43160	43147	43147	his	45	" Yes . "
43161	43171	43172	43172	Nick	49	" But I have n't got a flight booked . "
43199	43209	43186	43186	he	49	" Then get on the phone and do it . "
43210	43220	43172	43172	Nick	49	" But , my job . I 'm good ... "
43221	43236	43237	43237	Vane	45	" Then you 'll get another one . Maybe Microsoft will take you back . "
43242	43259	43237	43237	Vane	45	" My wife 's Australian . She does n't want to live in the States anymore . "
43260	43274	43275	43275	Nick	49	" Somehow I do n't think that 's going to be a problem , "
43278	43281	43275	43275	Nick	49	" Huh ? "
43386	43395	43396	43396	Vane	45	" Do n't look at me like that , "
43399	43403	43396	43396	Vane	45	" Like what ? "
43404	43412	43372	43372	Vane	45	" Like you want to kill me . "
43413	43428	43396	43396	Vane	45	" I do want to kill you . I 've had a bad week . "
43499	43508	43509	43509	Vane	45	" Okay , okay , I 'm leaving . "
43515	43577	43509	43509	Vane	45	" You know , when I heard you were pretending to be me , I thought we could turn this to our advantage . I could pretend to be you , just flying in to check on the last day of the seminar and attend the cocktail party and charm the pants off everyone . We 'd make a good team . "
43578	43597	43674	43674	Vane	45	" I do n't charm the pants off people , I talk straight and get the job done . "
43598	43618	43509	43509	Vane	45	" Yeah , right . Like all the women in the office do n't go ga ga over you . "
43619	43643	43509	43509	Vane	45	" That 's because I treat them with a little respect and do n't try to grab their asses as they walk past . "
43644	43653	43674	43674	Vane	45	" Hey , I only did that once . "
43654	43673	43674	43674	Vane	45	" Yeah , once when you were sober . Millions of times when you were under the influence . "
43692	43698	43700	43700	Vane	45	" So how about it ? "
43702	43705	43700	43700	Vane	45	" What ? "
43706	43717	43674	43674	Vane	45	" I pretend to be you . Just for tomorrow . "
43718	43745	43746	43746	Vane	45	" You 've already caused enough trouble for one week , why would I want you to stick around ? Do you think I 'm crazy ? "
43762	43766	43767	43767	Vane	45	" Get out . "
44095	44098	44099	44099	He	49	" Vane . "
44103	44123	44099	44099	He	49	" I 've changed my mind . Get a room . We 'll put your plan into action tomorrow . "
44124	44127	44128	44128	Vane	45	" Really ? "
44131	44142	44128	44128	Vane	45	" Great . I 've always wanted to be CEO . "
44143	44152	44154	44159	the pouty girl behind the counter	871	" I thought you said you already were , "
44219	44226	44228	44228	Vane	45	" So why the sudden change ? "
44230	44236	44228	44228	Vane	45	" What 's going on ? "
44237	44240	44241	44241	Nick	49	" Nothing , "
44248	44262	44241	44241	Nick	49	" This has something to do with a woman , does n’t it ? "
44285	44318	44278	44278	Vane	45	" Aha , I knew it . Men like me can always tell these things . This is great , Nick , just great . Guys like us need to stick together . "
44319	44326	44328	44328	Nick	49	" I 'm not like you , "
44338	44357	44334	44334	Vane	45	" Sure , whatever . So , what 's the problem , and where do I fit in ? "
44362	44396	44358	44358	Nick	49	" Hey , Nick , if I 'm going to play the role you need to tell me how to play it . Why do you want me to pretend to be you ? "
44397	44408	44360	44360	him	49	" I want to see how someone reacts to you . "
44409	44417	44358	44358	Nick	49	" Me , or me being you ? "
44418	44421	44358	44358	Nick	49	" Whatever . "
44422	44437	44438	44438	Nick	49	" Aha . So you 're putting this girl through some sort of test . "
44547	44552	44553	44553	Lucy	43	" Are you nuts ? "
44557	44560	44562	44562	Abbey	42	" Possibly , "
44564	44573	44562	44562	Abbey	42	" But I do n't want a lecture . "
44588	44594	44595	44595	Abbey	42	" So you 're going ? "
44598	44621	44595	44595	Abbey	42	" Why not ? Like Tarken said , it 's a good opportunity to network . I need a job , Lucy . "
44622	44643	44562	44562	Abbey	42	" Yes , but there 's other ways of getting jobs that do n't involve seeing that Vane creep again . "
44644	44673	44674	44674	Lucy	43	" He 's many things , but a creep is not one of them . Besides , it 'd be good to get some closure on our relationship . "
44682	44730	44674	44674	Lucy	43	" Closure . That 's a pathetic excuse . You just want to go to bed with him one last time . And then where will you be ? Sobbing in my apartment , that 's where , because you 've fallen in love with a creep . "
44731	44744	44745	44745	She	43	" He 's not a creep and I 'm not in love . "
44750	44783	44745	44745	She	43	" Besides , I deserve some good sex . I need some good sex . Something tells me I 'm not going to get it for a while after Damien leaves town . "
44806	44814	44815	44815	Abbey	42	" Vane ? What do you want ? "
44832	44835	44837	44837	Damien	45	" Abbey , "
44843	44848	44837	44837	Damien	45	" How are you ? "
44849	44854	44855	44855	Abbey	42	" Fine , thanks . "
44880	44904	44905	44905	Abbey	42	" Look , there 's a cocktail party tonight for seminar attendees , and I was wondering if you 'd like to come . "
44923	44926	44927	44927	she	42	" Okay , "
44942	44951	44955	44955	his	45	" Okay ? Really ? You 'll come ? "
45020	45037	45016	45016	She	42	" Tarken 's already asked me . I thought perhaps you and I could ... talk . "
45041	45048	45049	45049	Abbey	42	" Okay . We can talk . "
45065	45068	45069	45069	she	43	" Abbey , "
45072	45099	45069	45069	she	43	" is this a good idea ? You like this guy too much and he 's going to break your heart . I can feel it . "
45100	45113	45114	45114	Lucy	43	" Relax , Lucy , and let me handle it my way . "
45129	45140	45124	45124	she	43	" Mrs. Vane . Oh great , you got them . "
45209	45216	45205	45205	She	43	" That son of a bitch ! "
45217	45228	45229	45229	Lucy	43	" Who ? What 's going on ? Tell me ! "
45251	45273	45229	45229	Lucy	43	" I 've changed my mind . You should go to that seminar , and I think you should kill him . "
45274	45279	45229	45229	Lucy	43	" Who ? Damien ? "
45280	45285	45286	45286	Lucy	43	" No ! Yes ! "
45317	45323	45303	45303	Abbey	42	" What 's going on ? "
45333	45346	45324	45324	Lucy	43	" Mrs. Vane received the photos . It 's not Damien Vane ! "
45366	45381	45382	45382	Lucy	43	" What do you mean ? The guy I slept with was n't Damien ? "
45385	45414	45382	45382	Lucy	43	" Exactly . It 's his boss , Nick Delaware , the CEO of Software Solutions . Some rich investor from Sydney with a finger in every pie . "
45415	45418	45419	45419	Abbey	42	" Oh . "
45430	45441	45442	45442	Lucy	43	" So why was he pretending to be Damien Vane ? "
45445	45451	45442	45442	Lucy	43	" She did n't know . "
45452	45460	45461	45461	Lucy	43	" So where 's the real Vane ? "
45465	45473	45461	45461	Lucy	43	" She did n't know that either . "
45474	45479	45480	45480	Abbey	42	" Oh my God . "
45487	45495	45480	45480	Abbey	42	" What the hell is going on ? "
45510	45525	45480	45480	Abbey	42	" And why the hell did n't he tell me who he really was ? "
45526	45533	45535	45535	Lucy	43	" Because he 's a bastard , "
45544	45559	45535	45535	Lucy	43	" He 's worse than Vane . He 's a liar and a sleaze . "
45560	45575	45480	45480	Abbey	42	" Well , we do n't actually know that he 's a sleaze now . "
45576	45588	45589	45589	Abbey	42	" He slept with you straight away , did n't he ? "
45771	45776	45806	45806	Lucy	43	" nice to meet you "
45793	45799	45800	45800	she	42	" Give me the phone , "
45818	45841	45806	45806	Lucy	43	" I do n't think you should call him , Abbey . Just let him go . He 's not worth it . "
45850	45863	45864	45864	Abbey	42	" Or you should teach him a lesson at this party tonight . "
45887	45900	45901	45901	Lucy	43	" Yes . I think he needs to be taught a lesson . "
45904	45909	45901	45901	Lucy	43	" Great . How ? "
45913	45919	45910	45910	Abbey	42	" I have no idea . "
45929	45937	45910	45910	Abbey	42	" I think I have a few . "
46040	46049	46050	46050	Lucy	43	" Are you kidding ! You look stunning , "
46072	46075	46078	46078	he	46	" Wow , "
46081	46096	46078	46078	he	46	" How come you never dressed like that for me when we were dating ? "
46162	46174	46176	46176	Tarken	46	" Why do n't you come back and work for me , "
46188	46206	46176	46176	Tarken	46	" Because you 're a rat , and I can get another job . A better one . "
46207	46216	46217	46217	Abbey	42	" I 'll give you ten thousand extra . "
46220	46232	46233	46233	He	46	" You 'd have to do a lot better than that . "
46243	46247	46233	46233	He	46	" Twenty thousand . "
46253	46267	46233	46233	He	46	" That 's a lot of money . Goldstein would n't allow it . "
46268	46275	46233	46233	He	46	" I can deal with Goldstein . "
46313	46339	46310	46310	he	46	" Suit yourself . We 'll talk again in two weeks . I doubt you 'll have found anything as good as JJC by then . "
46834	46837	46839	46839	Tarken	46	" Damien , "
46854	46872	46844	46844	He	46	" So good to see you again . I believe you 've met my girlfriend , Abbey . "
46873	46882	46883	46883	she	42	" I 'm not your girlfriend , Tarken , "
46901	46908	46892	46892	he	49	" Yes , we 've met . "
47267	47270	47271	47271	he	117	" Hello , "
47290	47301	47281	47281	he	117	" I 'm Nick Delaware . I own Software Solutions . "
47529	47534	47535	47538	the real Damien Vane	45	" So you see , "
47547	47581	47542	47542	he	45	" that it 's lucky I 've got such good employees like Damien here , to entrust the company to . I 'm just far too busy to go to all these things . "
47582	47592	47593	47593	He	45	" Oh ? Busy doing what , Mr. Delaware ? "
47606	47635	47636	47636	Abbey	42	" Oh , flying around the world , closing business deals . I was in New York this week . Very nice city . Have you been there ? "
47684	47703	47670	47670	She	42	" I 'd love to go to New York , Mr. Delaware , please tell me about it . "
48216	48222	48224	48224	Tarken	46	" Look at those two , "
48226	48240	48224	48224	Tarken	46	" Ca n't keep their hands off each other . Makes me sick . "
48287	48297	48284	48284	Vane	45	" How could you work for such a scumbag ? "
48303	48326	48300	48300	his	46	" I thought Abbey had a little more self respect than to go for that type . He 's obviously a sleaze . "
48327	48334	48336	48336	Nick	49	" Maybe she likes that type , "
48353	48391	48392	48392	He	49	" If she did then she 'd still be with me . No , there 's something odd going on . I can tell , she hates the guy but she 's trying to flirt with him . "
48395	48407	48392	48392	He	49	" She 's not very good at it , is she ? "
48441	48453	48454	48454	he	49	" Seems to be enjoying herself from what I can see , "
48457	48469	48454	48454	he	49	" You do n't know her as well as I do . "
48487	48499	48500	48500	Tarken	46	" Well , this has been a waste of my time , "
48503	48527	48500	48500	Tarken	46	" Abbey dumps me for that bloke just because he 's got more dollars than sense and here I thought she liked you . "
48533	48542	48530	48530	his	46	" Women ! I do n't understand them . "
48865	48871	48872	48872	he	49	" Where are you going ? "
48875	48878	48879	48879	she	42	" Outside , "
48882	48888	48890	48890	Vane	45	" Back to the hotel , "
48896	48899	48890	48890	Vane	45	" Why ? "
48903	48907	48890	48890	Vane	45	" Why not ? "
48915	48920	48921	48921	he	49	" Do n't go , "
48937	48943	48944	48944	she	42	" What did you say ? "
48959	48973	48948	48948	He	49	" Nothing . Go . What you do is none of my business . "
49018	49023	49025	49025	Vane	45	" We 're going , "
49027	49038	49025	49025	Vane	45	" See you in the office on Monday , Vane . "
49316	49322	49323	49323	Vane	45	" Where are you going ? "
49331	49347	49323	49323	Vane	45	" Home . I 'm tired . Thanks for a , uh , nice evening . "
49356	49375	49376	49376	Abbey	42	" But I thought that you were ... I mean that maybe we could have a drink first . "
49381	49387	49376	49376	Abbey	42	" I 'm very tired . "
49397	49406	49407	49407	he	45	" I have a secret to tell you , "
49410	49419	49407	49407	he	45	" Something to do with me and Vane . "
49431	49435	49420	49420	Abbey	42	" Go on . "
49436	49448	49451	49451	he	45	" Come upstairs with me and I 'll tell you there . "
49628	49631	49632	49632	he	49	" What ? "
49635	49644	49632	49632	he	49	" Do n't play hard to get now . "
49645	49665	49614	49614	Repulsed	78	" I 'm not playing anything with you , Vane , especially anything that involves us having to touch . "
49666	49675	49676	49676	She	42	" Awe , now come on , Babe . "
49684	49697	49676	49676	She	42	" Do n't call me Babe . I 'm not your Babe . "
49748	49751	49752	49752	he	49	" Hey , "
49757	49769	49752	49752	he	49	" You called me Vane . I 'm Nick Delaware remember . "
49779	49783	49770	49770	He	49	" Silly girl . "
49784	49808	49809	49809	Vane	45	" Do n't give me that crap . I know who you are . What I want to know is why the secrecy ? "
49820	49827	49809	49809	Vane	45	" How long have you known ? "
49828	49833	49770	49770	He	49	" Since this afternoon . "
49834	49844	49770	49770	He	49	" So why the big charade at the party ? "
49845	49891	49892	49892	Vane	45	" You tell me . You and the real Nick Delaware seemed to have concocted some elaborate scheme to trick me . I want to know why . I want to know what ’s going on , and you ’d better tell me . Now ! "
49900	49944	49892	49892	Vane	45	" Beats me . You should ask him , he 's the boss . He does n't let me in on his reasons . Although I do know it has something to do with a woman . I assume that woman is you . "
49975	49983	49985	49985	Vane	45	" Looks like his plan backfired though , "
49990	49997	49985	49985	Vane	45	" What makes you say that ? "
50015	50036	49998	49998	Vane	45	" You 're here with me are n't you ? Something tells me that was n't part of his plan . "
50043	50053	50037	50037	She	42	" Are n't you worried about losing your job ? "
50054	50075	49998	49998	Vane	45	" He 's already fired me , so I do n't think it matters if I sleep with his girlfriend . "
50076	50083	50037	50037	She	42	" I 'm not his girlfriend . "
50084	50103	50104	50104	Abbey	42	" Then why did he drink himself into oblivion while watching us ? Looked like jealousy to me . "
50126	50136	50137	50137	Vane	45	" Maybe he was just enjoying the free champagne . "
50142	50172	50173	50173	He	45	" I 've never seen Delaware drink so much before . It 's not in his nature . He likes to be in control and that means staying sober . "
50181	50209	50173	50173	He	45	" I did n't think he was human until tonight . You must have had quite an effect on him to get him into such a state . "
50290	50296	50297	50297	she	42	" I have to go , "
50325	50335	50310	50310	She	42	" Hey , where are you going , Babe ? "
50336	50349	50350	50350	Vane	45	" None of your business . And I 'm not your Babe . "
50353	50386	50350	50350	Vane	45	" Going to find Delaware ? That the guy just put you through a test and you failed . I do n't think he 's going to be too receptive towards you . "
50391	50400	50401	50401	Vane	45	" A test ? What do you mean ? "
50404	50447	50401	50401	Vane	45	" I think that 's what this was all about . He was testing you to see if you went for me thinking I was Delaware . You know he 's loaded . He thought you were only interested in the money . "
50455	50476	50448	50448	His	45	" Guess he was wrong , since you already knew who was who and you still came back with me . "
50707	50710	50685	50685	she	42	" Abbey ! "
50825	50828	50829	50829	he	49	" Abbey , "
50833	50839	50829	50829	he	49	" We need to talk . "
50845	50853	50842	50842	her	42	" I 've had enough of talking . "
50887	50892	50866	50866	She	42	" I want you . "
50921	50935	50917	50917	Abbey	42	" Abbey , I want to talk to you . It 's important . "
50970	50973	50974	50974	she	42	" Later , "
50979	50995	50974	50974	she	42	" There 's something I have to do first . Something I need to do . "
51182	51187	51188	51188	he	49	" Oh , Abbey , "
51195	51200	51188	51188	he	49	" My sweet Abbey . "
51376	51380	51381	51381	He	49	" The bed . "
51521	51538	51539	51539	She	42	" I want to look at you , Abbey . I want to see your body . "
51779	51783	51784	51784	he	49	" Not yet , "
52254	52264	52246	52246	He	49	" Abbey ! Abbey , what are you doing ? "
52381	52400	52401	52401	She	42	" Abbey , what 's going on ? Let me go , and we 'll talk about this . "
52406	52425	52403	52403	her	42	" I 'm sorry , but it 's the only way I could stop you from touching me . "
52426	52437	52403	52403	her	42	" Why do n't you want me to touch you ? "
52438	52447	52403	52403	her	42	" Because when you do I lose control . "
52461	52464	52456	52456	He	49	" So ? "
52465	52515	52403	52403	her	42	" So , I do want to talk to you , but I do n't want you to touch me , and I know you will . And I know I ’ll respond . This is the only way I can say what I want to say without interruptions . "
52516	52521	52539	52539	her	980	" You 're lying . "
52542	52555	52539	52539	her	980	" You 're going to tease me to death are n't you ? "
52559	52570	52556	52556	Abbey	42	" No . I 'm not going to tease you — "
52571	52582	52583	52583	She	980	" You already are , just by standing there naked . "
52634	52639	52640	52640	he	49	" Stay like that , "
52643	52659	52640	52640	he	49	" If you stay like that I do n't mind being tied up , honestly . "
52727	52739	52720	52720	He	49	" This is n't funny anymore , Abbey . Untie me . "
52744	52759	52740	52740	Her	980	" You lied to me . You treated me like a piece of meat . "
52797	52809	52794	52794	Nick	49	" I 'm going to kill that little weasel , Vane . "
52810	52831	52832	52832	Nick	49	" Do n't blame him . He might be a weasel , but you 're a pig , Nick Delaware . "
52847	52854	52840	52840	his	49	" When did you find out ? "
52855	52865	52888	52888	she	980	" When his wife recognized you in the photos . "
52866	52877	52878	52878	She	980	" You came to the party knowing who I was ? "
52907	52913	52914	52914	she	980	" You lied to me , "
52917	52931	52914	52914	she	980	" You got Vane to lie to me too . You ’re despicable . "
52954	52975	52976	52976	she	980	" What sort of woman do you think I am , Nick ? Oh , yes , that 's right , "
52979	52987	52976	52976	she	980	" you think I 'm a whore . "
52988	52994	52950	52950	Her	980	" I do n't think — "
52995	53033	52950	52950	Her	980	" No , you did n't think , did you ? Do you have any idea how it made me feel when I found out you two were concocting a little game between yourselves to trap me ? "
53034	53049	52976	52976	she	980	" It was n't a game and I was n't trying to trap you . "
53050	53068	52950	52950	Her	980	" Then why the secrets ? Why was it so important you keep your identity from me ? "
53069	53095	52950	52950	Her	980	" Abbey , calm down . I just wanted to know whether you liked me for who I was , or because of my money . "
53096	53133	53134	53134	He	981	" So you let me think I was sleeping with a married man with a string of mistresses , just to see if I really liked you ? That 's low , Nick , real low . "
53213	53216	53217	53217	she	42	" Well ? "
53226	53233	53217	53217	she	42	" Did I pass your test ? "
53271	53292	53246	53246	she	42	" Abbey , this is ridiculous . Let me go . I mean it . This is n't a joke . "
53293	53323	53324	53324	He	49	" It never was a joke , Nick . And no , I will not let you go until you answer me . Did I pass your little test ? "
53330	53347	53348	53348	She	42	" Of course you did . You came here did n't you ? We made love ... "
53353	53360	53350	53350	her	42	" After I was with Vane . "
53653	53656	53657	53657	he	49	" Abbey , "
53667	53680	53661	53661	She	42	" Come here . Untie me and we 'll sort this out . "
53709	53719	53696	53696	She	42	" Abbey ! Abbey get back here ! Abbey ! "
53822	53831	53832	53832	Lucy	43	" Why do you do this to yourself ? "
53918	53928	53904	53904	She	42	" I let him think I slept with Vane . "
53929	53934	53935	53935	Abbey	42	" What ! Why ? "
53938	53952	53953	53953	She	42	" It seemed like a good way to punish him at the time . "
53956	53964	53965	53965	Lucy	43	" And because I 'm an idiot . "
53969	53985	53965	53965	Lucy	43	" You 're not an idiot . It 's probably your subconscious helping you out . "
54002	54041	54042	54042	Abbey	42	" Maybe you 're really not interested in Nick Delaware after all and it was your subconscious telling you . Besides , it 's a great punishment . I could n't have thought of a better one myself . "
54056	54070	54071	54071	Lucy	43	" That 's the lousiest piece of advice you 've given me yet . "
54074	54116	54117	54117	Lucy	43	" I know but it was the only thing I could come up with on short notice . Look , Abbey Girl , he 's gone back to Sydney already . Unless the hotel ’s housekeeper did n't arrive on time . "
54130	54180	54122	54122	Abbey	42	" Oh , now , I was kidding . It 's just that the image of a little old woman walking in on a naked Nick Delaware tied to a bed is hilarious . It ’s exactly what he deserves . Imagine his humiliation ! It ’s fantastically funny . "
54181	54193	54117	54117	Lucy	43	" No , it 's dreadful . He must hate me . "
54194	54197	54117	54117	Lucy	43	" Probably . "
54198	54210	54122	54122	Abbey	42	" Oh , Lucy , what am I going to do ? "
54211	54218	54117	54117	Lucy	43	" Nothing . Forget about him . "
54219	54233	54117	54117	Lucy	43	" I ca n't . I think I 'm in love with him . "
54234	54253	54122	54122	Abbey	42	" You have n't even known him a week ! How can you be in love with him ? "
54289	54324	54325	54325	Lucy	43	" Besides , it 's only been a day since you saw him — these things take time to get over . Give it another week or two and you 'll laugh about this . "
54328	54341	54325	54325	Lucy	43	" It 's very funny . I can just picture his face — "
54342	54358	54325	54325	Lucy	43	" Do n't , please . I feel like the worst woman in the world . "
54359	54398	54325	54325	Lucy	43	" Why ? What did you do ? He 's the one who lied . He 's the one who put you through a ridiculous test . He 's the one with an ego problem , not you . "
54399	54432	54325	54325	Lucy	43	" Yes , but I told him I slept with Vane when I did n't . Now he thinks that not only was his test justified but I 'm a slut too . "
54433	54492	54493	54493	Abbey	42	" Do n't let any man call you a slut . You 're not . No woman is . We do n't call single men names when they sleep around yet we get labeled sluts and whores when we do . It 's wrong . If any man called me a slut I 'd knock him down flat . "
54505	54533	54500	54500	Lucy	43	" Yes , but you did n't see the look on his face . He was ... horrified . I thought he was going to be sick . "
54714	54783	54784	54784	She	42	" Abbey Girl , let me assure you that however he looked last night , he 's going to forget about you within the week . He 'll be dating some society bimbo who fawns over him and really does only want him for his money . But I doubt he 'll forget the housekeeper 's face as she untied him — at least you made some impact . "
54788	54796	54784	54784	She	42	" I wish I 'd been there . "
54802	54819	54799	54799	her	42	" Do you think so ? Do you really think he 'll forget me that quickly ? "
54897	54909	54910	54910	Abbey	42	" It 's Tarken . Shall I get rid of him ? "
54957	54964	54952	54952	She	42	" Ask him what she wants . "
54974	54983	54965	54965	Lucy	43	" She wants to know what you want . "
55005	55061	55062	55062	Abbey	42	" He 's at the office . He says Goldstein wants a report and he has n't written it yet . He wants to know if you 'll go in and help him . He says he 'll pay you by the hour . Abbey , please give me the pleasure of telling him no . "
55066	55071	55062	55062	Abbey	42	" Be my guest . "
55072	55082	55083	55083	Lucy	43	" The answer 's no you bucket of slime , "
55089	55109	55110	55110	She	42	" Abbey does n't want to talk to you or see your ugly face ever again . Got it ? "
55118	55145	55110	55110	She	42	" Good girl . You 're making progress where he 's concerned at least . Now if we can just get you to forget about Nick . "
55692	55711	55688	55688	he	49	" Tarken Pratt from JJC Pharmaceuticals in Melbourne for you , sir . Shall I put him through ? "
55754	55758	55759	55759	he	49	" Delaware here , "
55765	55791	55759	55759	he	49	" Ah , yes , Mr. Delaware , we met in Melbourne last week . I was the , ah , date of Abbey McPherson . "
55839	55847	55834	55836	the little swine	1003	" If this is about the software — "
55848	55857	55858	55858	Tarken	46	" No , no , nothing like that , "
55861	55873	55858	55858	Tarken	46	" It 's about your VP of Marketing , Damien Vane . "
55874	55880	55834	55836	the little swine	1003	" Yes . Go on . "
55881	55893	55834	55836	the little swine	1003	" Well , I think he needs to be seriously reprimanded . "
55894	55899	55858	55858	Tarken	46	" Oh ? Why ? "
55900	55908	55834	55836	the little swine	1003	" Because he behaved terribly to Abbey . "
55916	55924	55925	55925	he	49	" Is she working for you again ? "
55929	55933	55925	55925	he	49	" Not exactly ... "
55950	55957	55934	55934	Nick	49	" So what 's the problem ? "
55958	55976	55925	55925	he	49	" Well , he behaved in an ungentlemanly manner toward her . I do n't like it . "
56033	56038	56039	56039	he	49	" What about me ? "
56069	56098	56099	56099	Tarken	46	" You approve of the way I acted towards her on Friday night , but not the way Vane acted during the week . Mind telling me why ? "
56104	56128	56101	56101	his	46	" Well , Mr. Delaware , now do n't get offended but I do n't think Abbey was all that interested in you . "
56129	56135	56101	56101	his	46	" No ? Why not ? "
56136	56148	56101	56101	his	46	" I think she was just trying to make me jealous . "
56149	56152	56101	56101	his	46	" You ? "
56153	56165	56101	56101	his	46	" Yes . She was only pretending to flirt with you . "
56166	56174	56101	56101	his	46	" Pretending ? Really ? And Vane ? "
56175	56217	56101	56101	his	46	" He 's just , well , I just do n't like the way he was watching Abbey that night . He also got incredibly drunk and I do n't think that 's appropriate behavior for a man in his position . "
56229	56245	56246	56246	He	49	" Thank you , I 'll take that on board and deal with it accordingly . "
56574	56584	56570	56570	her	896	" Can I get you some lunch , sir ? "
56597	56608	56592	56592	He	49	" No thanks , Beverly . I 'm not hungry . "
56614	56639	56592	56592	He	49	" But you have n't eaten anything all day . Usually you have breakfast , and at least three cups of coffee by now — "
56640	56653	56654	56654	She	73	" I appreciate your concern , but I 'm really not hungry . "
56659	56677	56654	56654	She	73	" Sure . What about those appointments you cancelled this morning ? Can I reschedule them yet ? "
56678	56708	56592	56592	He	49	" I do n't know when I 'll be able to fit them in . You 'd better cancel all of this afternoon 's and tomorrow 's meetings too . "
56709	56723	56654	56654	She	73	" B , but , sir , that 's a lot of appointments . "
56724	56729	56730	56730	he	49	" Just do it , "
57097	57109	57087	57087	He	49	" Oh , my goodness , sir , are you ill ? "
57110	57116	57119	57119	Beverly	73	" Yes . Go away . "
57128	57132	57133	57133	he	49	" Damn women , "
57383	57387	57381	57381	Nick	49	" Abbey McPherson ? "
57393	57396	57381	57381	Nick	49	" Yes ? "
57397	57417	57418	57418	Abbey	42	" It 's John Goldstein here . I want to talk to you about your position at JJC Pharmaceuticals . "
57622	57634	57635	57635	she	42	" Is there anything I need to know before you leave ? "
57644	57653	57638	57638	Tarken	46	" You 're going to run the office ? "
57654	57666	57683	57683	He	46	" Goldstein did n't tell you ? How remiss of him . "
57667	57675	57677	57677	Tarken	46	" Get Goldstein on the phone now , "
57716	57724	57725	57725	he	46	" He wants to talk to you , "
57750	57756	57736	57738	a deflated Tarken	46	" Yes , Mr. Goldstein ? "
57757	57777	57800	57800	Tarken	46	" Your first priority is to close the deal on the software . I want it installed before June . "
57778	57784	57785	57785	Abbey	42	" Yes , Mr. Goldstein . "
58261	58275	58254	58254	She	73	" What did you same this man 's name is again ? Pratt ? "
58276	58287	58288	58288	Beverly	73	" Pratt . And Donaldson , JJC 's head of I.T. "
58296	58303	58288	58288	Beverly	73	" Can I get you anything ? "
58304	58310	58254	58254	She	73	" Another cup of coffee . "
58311	58331	58254	58254	She	73	" I think you 've had enough . One more cup and you 'll be bouncing off the walls . "
58332	58338	58339	58339	he	49	" Black , one sugar , "
58347	58356	58342	58342	Beverly	73	" And Beverly , is everything set up ? "
58361	58378	58379	58379	She	73	" I 've booked them rooms at the Plaza just in case this goes into tomorrow . "
58743	58747	58748	58748	she	43	" Screw him , "
58752	58768	58748	58748	she	43	" What ? I thought you said I should n't get involved with him again . "
58769	58797	58748	58748	she	43	" No , I mean screw him on price . Tell him you 'll do whatever he wants if he gives you a discount on the software . "
58798	58825	58826	58826	Lucy	43	" I 'm not going to do that ! If he did n't think I was a whore before then he would if I said that . "
58830	58875	58826	58826	Lucy	43	" Okay , then just make him want you really bad so he 'll agree to everything . Even if he does n't , just make him want you . It 'd be fun to see him squirm . Wish I could be there . "
58876	58891	58826	58826	Lucy	43	" Then you can take my place because I do n't want to go . "
59026	59031	59033	59033	Beverly	73	" Here we go , "
59200	59203	59178	59178	He	700	" Abbey ! "
59209	59214	59204	59204	Abbey	42	" Hello , Nick . "
59417	59422	59411	59411	Nick	49	" Where 's Tarken ? "
59423	59435	59440	59440	Nick	49	" Tarken no longer works for JJC . I replaced him . "
59444	59449	59450	59450	he	49	" Good for you , "
59762	59769	59771	59771	Nick	49	" Let 's take a break , "
59780	59796	59778	59778	Abbey	42	" I think we should keep going . We have a six - thirty flight . "
59797	59826	59827	59827	Nick	49	" Actually Beverly booked you into a hotel for the night just in case . If you give her your flight details she 'll reschedule them for tomorrow . "
59864	59867	59868	59868	Nick	49	" Abbey ? "
59884	59892	59876	59876	She	42	" I 'll go see her now . "
59910	59931	59934	59934	her	73	" I also organized spare clothes for you for tonight and tomorrow . I hope I got your size right . "
59936	59965	59966	59966	Beverly	73	" This meeting seems to be taking longer than I thought . Nick wants to discuss every point . He does n't seem sure about anything in there . "
59974	59993	59966	59966	Beverly	73	" That does n't sound like Mr. Delaware . Usually his meetings are short and to the point . "
59994	59999	60000	60000	Beverly	73	" Not this one . "
60005	60053	60000	60000	Beverly	73	" How unusual . Just between us girls , most people call him The Machine round here . He just goes in , gets the job done and gets out again . No messing about . Does n't care who 's in the way usually . Although ... "
60065	60069	60054	60054	She	42	" Although ... ? "
60073	60097	60054	60054	She	42	" Well , he has been a little strange this last month . Ever since he got back from the seminar in Melbourne . "
60103	60109	60098	60098	Abbey	42	" Different ? How so ? "
60113	60134	60135	60135	She	42	" Not so ... aggressive . Actually , he 's been very nice . I quite like this new man . "
60138	60152	60135	60135	She	42	" I hope the other Nick does n't come back in a hurry . "
60383	60392	60394	60394	Willis	86	" How about we all meet for dinner , "
60396	60399	60401	60401	Nick	49	" Actually , "
60403	60424	60401	60401	Nick	49	" Abbey and I should discuss some financial details and I thought tonight would be a good opportunity . Abbey ? "
60445	60456	60457	60457	She	42	" I 'll pick you up around seven - thirty ? "
60527	60535	60536	60536	he	49	" I look forward to seeing you , "
60637	60640	60641	60641	She	42	" Ready ? "
60651	60655	60656	60656	she	42	" Where to ? "
60687	60701	60702	60702	He	49	" A nice restaurant on the Harbor . It has a great view . "
60713	60720	60702	60702	He	49	" It 's also very private . "
60958	60963	60965	60965	Abbey	42	" This is nice , "
61045	61061	61062	61062	He	49	" I thought you 'd like it . They have a great selection of wines . "
61112	61116	61118	61118	Nick	49	" Nice choice , "
61120	61128	61118	61118	Nick	49	" You have great taste in wines . "
61129	61135	61154	61154	She	42	" Expensive taste you mean . "
61175	61183	61184	61184	she	42	" Maybe this was a bad idea , "
61195	61210	61189	61189	Nick	49	" No ! You ca n't go , we have n't even ... eaten . "
61211	61247	61248	61248	His	49	" Look , Nick , this is uncomfortable . We 're here to work , not re - live what happened a month ago . I think we should concentrate on the business at hand . "
61263	61296	61255	61255	He	49	" Abbey , do n't go . I 'm sorry . That was my fault . I do n't think ... well , I do n't think you 're a hooker anymore . "
61418	61421	61422	61422	he	49	" Congratulations , "
61433	61437	61426	61426	Abbey	42	" What for ? "
61438	61448	61449	61449	She	42	" The promotion . Tarken must 've been surprised . "
61452	61468	61449	61449	She	42	" Angry more like it . I had threatening phone calls for a week afterwards . "
61475	61484	61469	61469	Nick	49	" He did n't try anything did he ? "
61485	61515	61426	61426	Abbey	42	" No . He 's all hot air and no action . Anyway , he got another job the following week and I have n't heard from him since . "
61516	61543	61449	61449	She	42	" Good . I 'd hate to think he was bothering you . There 's nothing worse than having a psycho ex boyfriend on your hands . "
61544	61549	61550	61550	Nick	49	" Speaking from experience ? "
61553	61559	61550	61550	Nick	49	" Not about the boyfriend . "
61581	61588	61589	61589	Abbey	42	" Melinda also found another job , "
61592	61603	61604	61604	He	49	" She suddenly felt uncomfortable with me as her boss . "
61607	61623	61604	61604	He	49	" I do n't blame her . I think you 'd make a scary boss . "
61624	61648	61649	61649	Nick	49	" Scary ! I 'm the nicest boss around . Unlike you , I imagine . I hear they call you The Machine . "
61652	61658	61649	61649	Nick	49	" Who told you that ? "
61668	61672	61673	61673	he	49	" The Machine ? "
61680	61696	61678	61678	himself	49	" I wonder what that 's supposed to mean ? That I work long hours ? "
61721	61734	61709	61709	he	49	" I think it means that you 're , well , heartless . "
61735	61753	61754	61754	He	49	" Heartless ! I 've got a big heart . Especially when it comes to my staff . "
61761	61772	61756	61756	his	49	" I ca n't believe they think I 'm heartless . "
61776	61794	61773	61773	She	42	" I also heard that you 've change in the last month . Changed for the better . "
61800	61806	61795	61795	He	49	" Changed ? How so ? "
61810	61816	61807	61807	She	42	" Just nicer I guess . "
61817	61822	61837	61837	Nick	49	" Nicer . Hmmm . "
61823	61836	61837	61837	Nick	49	" So what happened a month ago to change you so drastically ? "
61893	61896	61897	61897	He	49	" Well ? "
61914	61917	61918	61918	she	42	" Well ? "
61922	61928	61918	61918	she	42	" Abbey , do n't . "
61933	61936	61929	61929	He	49	" Why ? "
61937	61943	61918	61918	she	42	" This is n't fair . "
61944	62004	62005	62005	He	49	" Nothing about this was ever fair , Nick . Let 's face it , I was n't fair to you and you were n't fair to me . There 's been a lot of water under the bridge between us , and I just want to start hearing the truth from you . I 'm tired of lies . "
62018	62080	62008	62008	His	49	" Do you want me to tell you I 've hated every minute of the last month because I ca n't get you out of my head ? Or would you prefer I tell you that we were just one of those things that burns brightly and dies just as quickly ? Well , which is it to be , Abbey ? "
62085	62091	62081	62081	His	49	" The truth , Nick . "
62102	62111	62092	62092	He	49	" I 'm not ready for the truth . "
62219	62231	62232	62232	Nick	49	" I think we 'd better stick to safe conversation tonight , "
62237	62241	62232	62232	Nick	49	" Like business ? "
62247	62267	62244	62244	his	49	" Tell me about you , Abbey . You never really did let me see who you really were . "
62271	62277	62268	62268	She	42	" I 'm so boring . "
62286	62303	62278	62278	Nick	49	" You 're the least boring person I 've ever met — after Lucy that is . "
62323	62331	62332	62332	he	49	" Tell me where you were born , "
62335	62377	62332	62332	he	49	" And then tell me where you grew up . I want to know about your parents , brothers and sisters , whether you liked school and what sort of dress you wore to the school dance . Things like that . "
62378	62401	62402	62402	He	49	" Well , the last one 's easy . It was purple with puffy mutton - chop sleeves . It was hideous . "
62405	62428	62402	62402	He	49	" I bet you were n't hideous though . I bet all the guys in school wanted to date you back then . "
62437	62455	62431	62431	her	42	" If I tell you about me , then I expect the same from you . Okay ? "
62459	62484	62456	62456	He	49	" Deal . All the gory details , including what I wore to my school dance . Something tells me you 'll laugh though . "
62493	62506	62485	62485	She	42	" Me ? Laugh at Nick Delaware ? I would n't dare . "
62507	62510	62511	62511	Nick	49	" Wrong . "
62516	62532	62511	62511	Nick	49	" You 're the only person I 've ever met who does laugh at me . "
62533	62538	62539	62539	They	1111	" Except for Lucy . "
62668	62672	62673	62673	Abbey	42	" Lovely evening , "
62838	62846	62847	62847	he	49	" This was nice tonight , Abbey , "
62850	62854	62847	62847	he	49	" Very nice , "
62877	62894	62895	62895	Abbey	42	" So tell me , Ms. McPherson , do you put out on the first date ? "
62898	62906	62895	62895	Abbey	42	" This is n't our first date . "
62907	62911	62912	62912	he	49	" I know , "
62915	62922	62912	62912	he	49	" but it feels like it . "
62964	62980	62981	62981	she	42	" I only put out for the right sort of man on the first date , "
62987	62992	62981	62981	she	42	" Do I qualify ? "
63004	63011	62993	62993	She	42	" I guess you 'll do . "
63044	63052	63053	63053	Nick	49	" Actually , you 'll do perfectly . "
63065	63081	63082	63082	She	42	" Hurry up and get in the car then . I 'm not a machine . "
63128	63146	63122	63122	Abbey	42	" This is n't going to be like the last time we had dinner together is it ? "
63152	63155	63122	63122	Abbey	42	" Why ? "
63156	63171	63172	63172	He	49	" I 've only got one spare pair of underwear , so no ripping . "
63175	63182	63183	63183	He	49	" Promise I 'll be gentle . "
63189	63209	63183	63183	He	49	" But if you do n't hurry up , I ca n't be held responsible for what I do . "
63378	63382	63383	63383	he	49	" Not yet , "
63386	63390	63383	63383	he	49	" You first . "
63435	63439	63425	63425	she	42	" Oh my ... "
63514	63518	63519	63519	she	42	" Come here , "
63561	63569	63558	63558	her	42	" I want you to lie down . "
63647	63666	63640	63640	Nick	49	" If you keep doing that I wo n't last long . It 's been a whole month . "
63887	63892	63893	63893	he	49	" What 's wrong ? "
63918	63925	63907	63907	he	49	" What 's wrong , Sweetheart ? "
63935	63951	63952	63952	She	42	" On the night when I left , I told you I slept with Vane . "
63962	63970	63971	63971	Nick	49	" I lied . I did n't . "
63996	64006	63991	63991	He	49	" Then why did you tell me you did ? "
64014	64020	64007	64007	She	42	" To hurt your feelings . "
64021	64025	64026	64026	he	49	" You succeeded , "
64053	64064	64065	64065	she	42	" Why do n't you want to talk about this ? "
64068	64099	64065	64065	she	42	" Because I want to forget about it . I want to start over . I 'm not proud of the way I lost control over the situation back then . "
64100	64111	64113	64113	Abbey	42	" I 'm not proud of a lot things either , "
64136	64153	64154	64154	He	49	" You do n't believe me do you ? You still think I slept with him . "
64171	64184	64185	64185	He	49	" Nick stop . Talk to me . Do you believe me ? "
64188	64204	64185	64185	He	49	" Abbey , I told you , I do n't want to talk about it . "
64307	64315	64316	64316	she	1127	" Why do n't you believe me ? "
64338	64379	64324	64324	Nick	49	" Abbey , it does n't matter . The important thing is I want to start all this over again and do it properly . I 've decided I want to be with you . What happened then is history . "
64380	64452	64453	64453	Abbey	42	" It 's not history ! It was only a month ago . And you do n't believe me ! Will you ever believe me , Nick , or will you always wonder if I 'm here because of your money ? Will you always wonder what really happened that night ? Will you always think I came to you because I wanted the real Nick Delaware , the wealthy one ? "
64464	64477	64459	64459	Nick	49	" Abbey , do n't do this . It 's not necessary . "
64478	64500	64453	64453	Abbey	42	" Damn you , it is necessary ! You still think I 'm here for your money , do n't you ? "
64501	64509	64459	64459	Nick	49	" Abbey , I do n't care . "
64525	64539	64540	64540	He	49	" What ? You do n't care that I 'm a gold digger ? "
64585	64591	64579	64579	she	42	" Do n't touch me . "
64592	64602	64603	64603	He	49	" Abbey , Sweetheart , please listen to me . "
64624	64671	64672	64672	He	49	" I 'm sorry if you feel like that , but you 're right . I wonder about it , but I 've decided I do n't care if you slept with him or not . I just want you . I 've made my decision . "
64682	64697	64678	64678	she	1130	" Have you decided that I 'm a liar as well as a whore ? "
64698	64707	64678	64678	she	1130	" Abbey , do n't talk like that . "
64708	64723	64724	64724	Nick	49	" It 's true . You think I 'm after you for your money . "
64730	64757	64727	64727	his	49	" So what ? I do n't care . Have it . It has n't made me happy , but if that 's what you want — "
64758	64766	64767	64767	Nick	49	" It 's not what I want ! "
64783	64812	64773	64773	He	49	" I think I 'd better go . You need some sleep . I 'm sure in the morning you 'll see this from my point of view . "
65738	65746	65757	65757	Abbey	42	" We want a twenty percent discount . "
65747	65751	65752	65752	Nick	49	" Twenty percent ? "
65787	65810	65811	65811	Abbey	42	" It 's reasonable considering we 're the first client for this product . We are the first client are n't we ? "
65856	65862	65863	65863	She	42	" How did you know ? "
65866	65898	65863	65863	She	42	" I did some checking . And Donaldson tells me it 's standard practice to give the guinea pigs a discount . We 'll act as a reference site of course . "
65904	65908	65909	65909	He	49	" Of course . "
65917	65923	65914	65914	his	49	" You have a deal . "
65992	66005	65979	65979	she	42	" Have the contract drawn up and send it down to us . "
66006	66011	66012	66012	She	42	" You 're leaving ? "
66019	66027	66012	66012	She	42	" We have a six o'clock flight . "
66040	66065	66066	66066	She	42	" If you wait I 'll have the contract drawn up tonight . You can take it with you first thing in the morning . "
66088	66105	66106	66106	He	49	" Please , Abbey . I need to talk to you . Stay one more night . "
66157	66161	66162	66162	he	49	" You okay ? "
66165	66176	66177	66177	He	49	" Fine . We 'll talk . That 's all . "
66190	66199	66184	66184	Beverly	73	" Damien Vane returning your call , sir . "
66221	66228	66229	66229	he	49	" I 'll be right there , "
66241	66251	66229	66229	he	49	" Abbey , I have to ask him something — "
66252	66264	66265	66265	Her	42	" I hope you get the answer you want to hear . "
66419	66428	66430	66430	Vane	45	" So what does my ex boss want ? "
66433	66452	66430	66430	Vane	45	" There 's something I need to know about the night you spent in Melbourne a month ago . "
66453	66470	66476	66476	his	45	" Ah , you want to know about that hot little woman in the blue dress . "
66495	66508	66509	66509	Vane	45	" Yes . I want to know if you slept with her . "
66512	66563	66509	66509	Vane	45	" Got you by the balls has she , Delaware ? Does n't surprise me . She looks like the type that would cling . Me , I like the ones who just want a night of pure ecstasy . It makes life easier when they do n't want commitment . "
66564	66570	66476	66476	his	45	" Just answer my question . "
66571	66652	66653	66653	Nick	49	" Seeing as I 'm such a nice guy and I think you two will make a cute couple , I 'll tell you the truth , even though it 'll damage my reputation . No , I did n't sleep with her . She left as soon as she got in my room . Seems she was just trying to make you jealous . Sounds like it worked if you 're still thinking about her after all this time . "
66852	66872	66850	66850	Beverly	73	" Send in Ms. McPherson please . There 's some last minute details to go through for the contract . "
66955	66996	66997	66997	He	49	" Abbey , I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry I did n't believe you . But I do now , and it does n't matter . Everything 's fine , Abbey , everything 's going to be fine . "
67032	67088	67025	67025	Nick	49	" Abbey ? Talk to me . I spoke to Vane , he confirmed your story , and now I just want to be with you . I know you 're upset that I did n't believe you at first , but you understand that I had to know for sure . Do n't you ? "
67089	67096	67097	67097	she	42	" You did n't trust me , "
67100	67136	67097	67097	she	42	" Sweetheart , I do now . I 'm sorry I did n't believe you . I understand why you 're angry but all I can say is I 'm sorry . I needed proof . "
67137	67144	67145	67145	she	42	" You did n't trust me , "
67149	67159	67145	67145	she	42	" Honey , let 's talk about this later . "
67236	67271	67272	67272	He	49	" How about you go back to the hotel and I 'll get the ball rolling on this contract . I 'll come past and pick you up and take you to my place . "
67277	67312	67313	67313	He	49	" I hope you like it . It 'll be yours soon . If we decide to live in Sydney , that is . But you do n't have to make that decision yet . "
67367	67372	67373	67373	she	73	" You look pale , "
67376	67385	67373	67373	she	73	" are you sure you 're feeling okay ? "
67430	67455	67456	67456	Beverly	73	" Um , I 'd like to change my flight back to tonight . Can you get me on the next plane to Melbourne ? "
67459	67463	67456	67456	Beverly	73	" Of course . "
67473	67498	67464	67464	She	73	" There 's a flight in an hour . But it 's not the same as Mr. Donaldson 's . He 's already gone . "
67754	67770	67789	67790	The lawyer	1166	" Take your time . She 'll take it with her tomorrow when she leaves . "
67851	67858	67859	67859	he	49	" I might be late tomorrow , "
67862	67900	67859	67859	he	49	" I thought I 'd show Ms. McPherson the sights of Sydney in the morning while we 're waiting for the contract . Give me a call when you get it and we 'll head back in . "
67901	67908	67910	67910	Beverly	73	" I thought she told you , "
67914	67927	67910	67910	Beverly	73	" She 's changed her mind and is catching a flight tonight . "
67942	67948	67949	67949	She	73	" Tonight ? What time ? "
67954	67965	67949	67949	She	73	" It leaves in a little over half an hour . "
68239	68242	68243	68243	he	49	" Abbey , "
68254	68263	68264	68264	She	42	" Abbey , do n't go . Please . "
68293	68309	68310	68310	He	49	" Abbey , speak to me . Please , I , I do n't understand ... "
68326	68350	68351	68351	He	49	" Please , do n't go . Give me a chance , Abbey . Whatever the problem is we can work it out . "
68385	68402	68377	68377	she	42	" Nick , I ca n't handle this anymore . The parting is just too hard . "
68403	68416	68417	68417	He	49	" Then do n't leave ! Abbey stay with me , please . "
68430	68435	68436	68436	he	49	" I need you , "
68471	68483	68484	68484	He	49	" You do n't get it , do you , Nick ? "
68489	68506	68484	68484	He	49	" No . I admit I do n't . I thought it was all cleared up . "
68507	68536	68537	68537	Nick	49	" For you it is . All you cared about was whether I slept with Vane . You did n't believe me when I said I did n't . "
68568	68587	68555	68555	He	49	" I wanted to believe you , Abbey . Really I did . But I was ... scared . "
68668	68676	68663	68663	He	49	" No . You ca n't go . "

My heart knew you were n't , my heart never thought you lied , but after all the lies that passed between us at the beginning , my head just took over . That 's the way I am , Abbey . My head has always ruled Nick Delaware . Until now , I thought my heart was just another organ . But you stole it . You ripped it out of me and now it hurts like hell because you wo n't give it back . I 'm sorry I did n't trust you . I 'm sorry I did n't follow my heart from the beginning . "
68952	68962	68945	68945	She	42	" Abbey , please , you 're scaring me . "

69532	69555	69556	69556	He	49	" A house needs to be christened . A different room each night . That should keep us occupied for a while . "
69566	69575	69562	69562	he	49	" I plan on christening every room tonight . "
69588	69596	69576	69576	Abbey	42	" Just how many rooms are there ? "

70936	70953	70929	70929	She	43	" You 're sorry you called me a detective ? Since when is that an insult ? "
70973	70996	70929	70929	She	43	" I was a cop once , briefly . The detectives were my least favorite rank in the force . Too arrogant . "
70997	71024	71025	71025	Lucy	43	" Do you have a reason for this bias or is it just based on the fact that you could n't make it as a cop ? "
71044	71056	71034	71035	this guy	1340	" Ahhh . I get it . You are a detective . "

72840	72852	72828	72828	He	1296	" Lucy 's becoming a pest . Get rid of her . "
72858	72899	72855	72855	his	94	" I do n't know why Mollino does n't give his wife a divorce so he can sleep with anyone he wants . It 's a waste of time making sure the PI she employs does n't ruin our investigation . "
72917	72929	72909	72909	he	94	" Because he ca n't afford to lose half his assets . "

72942	72948	72949	72949	Nick	94	" Is there a difference ? "
72952	72971	72949	72949	Nick	94	" Sneaking around seems like a lot of hassle when he could just get a nice clean divorce . "
72972	72984	72855	72855	his	94	" There 's no such thing as a nice clean divorce . "
73079	73082	73084	73085	the Chief	1296	" Dante , "
73087	73110	73084	73085	the Chief	1296	" catch Lucy in the act , then warn her to stay away from Mollino . Arrest her if you have to . "
73382	73389	73390	73390	she	43	" Ah , there you are , "
73450	73458	73448	73448	Dante	94	" And there 's your little floozy . "

73607	73616	73617	73617	she	43	" That 's it , take it off , "
