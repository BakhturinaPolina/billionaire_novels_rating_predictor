21332	21389	21390	21390	He	64	“ You made me feel different . I had to be careful with you . But even with the guys that I dated that seemed more harmless , it was bad news in the end . The good times are n’t even really that good . I did n’t want that to happen with you too . ”
21412	21422	21406	21406	his	64	“ Any particular reason they were n’t worth it ? ”
21423	21515	21406	21406	his	64	“ Because the guys do n’t get me . It ’s like every time I blurt out the wrong thing I want to shove something into my mouth . I feel mortified when I see them get embarrassed . I feel odd and like I just do n’t fit . I just do n’t fit as the second part of a relationship , I ’m just too guarded . Maybe I ’m too independent . My friendship with you was more important to me , I realized . At the time . ”
21528	21539	21406	21406	his	64	“ Is there a reason you ’re telling me this ? ”
21540	21569	21570	21570	I	0	“ Yes . I wanted you to know why I never wanted to go there with you . I was scared that you were too valuable to me . ”
21843	21874	21813	21813	he	190	“ So did you let me in here to listen to more of my plan , or are you planning to discourage me from wanting to do business with you ? ”
21875	21889	21890	21890	He	190	“ I let you in here for reasons I ca n’t even comprehend . ”
21913	21946	21907	21907	he	190	“ I ca n’t lose this chance , Aaric . I really want this . It ’s easy for you to string me along when you ’ve never lost anything at all . ”
21947	21953	21964	21964	he	190	“ I ’ve lost something . ”
22014	22019	22020	22020	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
22023	22031	22020	22020	I	0	“ Fuck . I ’m sorry too . ”
22048	22058	22032	22032	He	190	“ So what was it ? That you lost . ”
22078	22081	22082	22082	he	190	“ Somebody , ”
22091	22096	22088	22088	I	0	“ You loved her . ”
22097	22103	22104	22104	he	190	“ Aside from my mom , ”
22107	22127	22104	22104	he	190	“ Yes , but I never got the chance to love her . She died when she was born . ”
22138	22144	22145	22145	He	190	“ You had a daughter ? ”
22161	22166	22145	22145	He	190	“ And your wife ? ”
22167	22173	22145	22145	He	190	“ Not wife . Friend . ”
22174	22178	22145	22145	He	190	“ What happened ? ”
22179	22200	22145	22145	He	190	“ She got depressed , left my life , fell in love later , got married . We talk occasionally . ”
22201	22208	22209	22209	I	0	“ Oh . I ’m glad . ”
22218	22225	22209	22209	I	0	“ I ’m sorry about that . ”
22345	22379	22331	22331	I	0	“ See , sometimes I ’m feeling lonely like nothing will ever turn out my way . I feel different , like a red ink stain on a page full of gold dots . ”
22380	22407	22295	22295	He	190	“ I know what you mean . I used to feel like I was a tear on a page , not a red ink stain though . ”
22408	22417	22496	22496	his	190	“ Why ? Like you tore the page ? ”
22418	22421	22496	22496	his	190	“ Yep . ”
22422	22432	22295	22295	He	190	“ Like you ’re the tear on a page ? ”
22433	22436	22295	22295	He	190	“ Yep . ”
22437	22448	22496	22496	his	190	“ Wow , that ’s awful . Are you okay ? ”
22449	22455	22295	22295	He	190	“ Obviously I ’m not . ”
22456	22461	22462	22462	I	0	“ Yeah . Sigh . ”
22465	22473	22474	22474	he	190	“ Go on . You were saying , ”
22477	22493	22474	22474	he	190	“ Oh nothing , only that all these feelings go away when you ’re close . ”
22507	22512	22513	22513	His	190	“ Why is that . ”
22525	22568	22513	22513	His	190	“ Because another feeling comes in when you ’re close and it ’s all I can feel . Like a glass of oil is overflowing with water until the oil overflows and then it ’s just the most fresh and hydrating water . ”
22569	22578	22579	22579	He	190	“ I ’m the water in your glass . ”
22602	22616	22599	22599	I	0	“ You fill my glass . I suppose you ’re the water too . ”
22676	22682	22683	22683	he	190	“ I had no idea , ”
22696	22705	22683	22683	he	190	“ how much I missed you , bit . ”
22730	22740	22710	22710	I	0	“ Why . Do I fill your glass too ? ”
22741	22745	22746	22746	He	190	“ Not sure . ”
22751	22761	22746	22746	He	190	“ Maybe you just fill my well , girl . ”
23436	23455	23429	23429	I	0	“ Brynny ! You ’re back just in time for tea . Come sit with Milly and me . ”
23456	23466	23418	23419	Mrs. Ford	77	“ Oh , Mrs. Ford … I could n’t … ”
23467	23474	23475	23475	she	77	“ You can and you will , ”
23488	23492	23484	23484	I	0	“ Five minutes , ”
23506	23521	23418	23419	Mrs. Ford	77	“ Tell me about yourself , Brynny . How are you finding New York ? ”

23539	23563	23533	23533	she	77	“ It ’s a jungle , Mrs. Ford , but I suppose I ’m learning the ropes of how to survive around here . ”
23564	23568	23418	23419	Mrs. Ford	77	“ Like what ? ”
23569	23600	23605	23605	she	77	“ Like if I stand at the pizza line and do n’t know exactly , exactly , what I ’m having when it ’s my turn , I get skipped . ”
23620	23649	23650	23650	She	77	“ At my age , you can imagine what a shock the city was . It ’s why I ’d rather look at the city from up here . ”
23661	23684	23658	23658	I	0	“ If you ever want to go out , I ’d be happy to walk with you or ride with you anywhere . ”
23685	23706	23707	23707	I	0	“ Thank you , but I do have family who visits occasionally . But thank you for offering , Brynny . ”

23985	24000	23930	23930	She	77	“ You ’re a small little thing . Much more trouble than you look . ”
24001	24007	23930	23930	She	77	“ I ’m not trouble . ”
24008	24023	24024	24024	She	77	“ The places you take a guy ’s thoughts … pure trouble , bit . ”
24063	24072	24073	24073	she	77	“ You going to miss anything about here ? ”
24077	24085	24073	24073	she	77	“ I ’m going to miss you . ”

25142	25181	25182	25182	He	64	“ I ’d dedicate as much time to the business as you ’d need . I just need six hours of sleep a day , and I ’m willing to invest the 3,450 dollars I ’ve got saved . ”
25231	25241	25224	25224	he	64	“ What is your daily schedule like , bit ? ”

26116	26160	26102	26102	His	64	“ I was nervous about the whole process . Look ! Do n’t look at me like that . If I ’d wanted someone thorough and good with his hands , I ’d have given it to someone like … well , you . ”

26312	26320	26321	26321	he	64	“ He was no good for you , ”
26370	26404	26405	26405	He	64	“ See ? This is what you get for asking so many questions . TMI . And now awkward silence . And a drunk client - slash - business - partner or whatever . ”

29713	29722	29723	29723	He	64	“ What is the purpose of these cuts ? ”
29739	29756	29757	29757	I	0	“ I … well , I suppose showing a little skin is never a bad thing . ”
29781	29792	29793	29793	He	64	“ Bad for whom ? The wearer or the looker ? ”
29800	29835	29793	29793	He	64	“ I … suppose both . The wearer has the pleasure of … well , feeling some air against her skin and of … possibly feeling some attention she may crave coming her way . ”
29836	29842	29796	29796	his	64	“ And the looker … ? ”

29907	29937	29903	29903	I	0	“ They ’re about expressing yourself , who you are , and setting the stage for how you want to be treated , how you want to be seen . ”
29950	29973	29938	29938	He	64	“ You ’re saying you have control over the way you ’re seen by others depending on the way you present yourself . ”
29974	29980	29981	29981	I	0	“ Yes . I am . ”
30014	30033	30034	30034	I	0	“ Say I ’m wearing comfortable clothes so I just want to be feeling comfortable , treated friendly , ”
30037	30079	30034	30034	I	0	“ Maybe if I want to be treated more sensually , I ’d wear a short dress , with cleavage , something that sends out the message of what I want from … well , from the party I ’m seeing . ”

36857	36889	36890	36890	He	843	“ What if you love someone else , and someone else loves you ? What if you want to take someone else to bed , and she wants to take you ? ”
36905	36913	36894	36894	His	843	“ Why did you bring me here ? ”
36914	36929	36930	36930	He	843	“ You seemed upset . I did n’t want you to be alone tonight . ”

37341	37384	37269	37269	His	843	“ The idea of you and me being involved , bit . To us taking things to where we want them . Tonight I want you to sleep here — I can sleep in a separate room if you need your space . ”
37385	37401	37402	37402	I	0	“ I do n’t want space . But I do n’t want to regret anything … ”
37445	37465	37466	37466	I	0	“ I suppose if I ’m staying I should change . Do you have something decent I can wear ? ”

38662	38760	38615	38615	Sara	60	“ No . It’s … well , yes . He ’s my new business partner now . So hanky panky is n’t really a good idea . Last night I was just … I just had an emotional breakdown , a little one . I thought he was playing around with me . Then he gave me the check and I felt like a fool … and I felt grateful , and it just … brought his memories back up again . It was a weird night . It ’s over . Now I ’m all business . ”

39375	39412	39372	39372	his	64	“ What you did is bad business . Why would you possibly do that ? She ’s very unhappy about that . Plus to get on Santorini ’s bad side when he owns half of Brooklyn … ”

39776	39841	39773	39773	he	81	“ Well , it ’s just that I do n’t want you to misinterpret what we have for anything other than business . It seemed imperative I see you , and I thought it best to personally tell you that I was out of line . I ’m not interested in dating you , but I really appreciate what you ’ve done for me … ”
39890	39894	39895	39895	he	81	“ Got it , ”

40163	40217	40145	40145	his	81	“ I do n’t know . It took me aback after weeks of not knowing . I got overwhelmed . I do n’t want you to think I spent the night because you gave me the money , it just … reminded me of you . Years ago . Made feelings come up . ”
40218	40231	40122	40122	he	81	“ Seeing you on edge made feelings come up for me too . ”
40232	40236	40145	40145	his	81	“ Which feelings ? ”

46808	46817	46818	46818	he	64	“ 12:59 is the time the fire started , ”
46841	46869	46837	46837	he	64	“ When Leilani went into labor , I was away on business . She ended up in some shitty hospital . My daughter did n’t make it . ”
46878	46899	46870	46870	He	64	“ I thought I did n’t want her . I convinced myself it happened because I did n’t want her . ”
46900	46924	46938	46938	He	64	“ Of course it did n’t happen because of that . She was n’t in your plans . We could n’t have known . ”
46925	46930	46938	46938	He	64	“ We should ’ve . ”
46931	46937	46938	46938	He	64	“ But we did n’t . ”
46951	46961	46938	46938	He	64	“ Hey . The fire was n’t your fault . ”
46962	46971	46972	46972	He	64	“ Neither is the death of your baby . ”
46984	46999	47000	47000	he	64	“ Some what ifs , some you never get to do over , Bryn , ”
47012	47019	47003	47003	I	0	“ Sometimes you get another try , ”
47053	47060	47050	47050	he	64	“ I ’ll take you home . ”
47535	47574	47575	47575	I	0	“ I do enjoy reading these suckers , though I never pay attention to any negative things they have to say . I only run with the good ones . This time though , it ’s way off . ”
47578	47606	47575	47575	I	0	“ Read mine . Wait , you read it first before telling me what it says . Shit , do n’t tell me if it ’s bad . ”
47607	47613	47575	47575	I	0	“ What ’s your sign ? ”
47614	47630	47631	47631	Sara	60	“ Taurus . Ruled by Venus , I apparently like very beautiful and expensive things . ”
47638	47644	47631	47631	Sara	60	“ What does it say ? ”
47645	47663	47664	47664	I	0	“ Do n’t peek and do n’t talk , I ca n’t concentrate reading with noise around ! ”
47762	47768	47774	47774	I	0	“ What does it say ? ”
47769	47773	47774	47774	I	0	“ Dear Taurus , ”
47777	47812	47774	47774	I	0	“ If you still love him , go for it . Do n’t wait for my astrologer permission , do n’t wait for me to give you a safety net , just do it ! ”
47813	47816	47817	47817	She	60	“ What ? ”
47823	47837	47817	47817	She	60	“ Bryn , you are a lousy astrologer . You ’d die poor . ”
47853	47892	47893	47893	I	0	“ No , really . You ’re hooked on him , Sara . I do think you need to find him . Why wait ? You can be waiting forever . Why do we give our power away ? ”
47896	47963	47893	47893	I	0	“ I mean , we ’re bombarded by all these marketers telling us what to think , how to feel about ourselves , we wait to see what others think about our clothes to determine if we really like them . We wait for an astrologer to tell us the coast is clear to do something we ’ve been wanting to do . It ’s wrong . ”
48062	48086	48053	48053	Sara	60	“ Let ’s do something we really want to do . Let ’s finally do something for ourselves , take our own advice . ”
48087	48091	48092	48092	She	60	“ Okay then . ”
48098	48131	48092	48092	She	60	“ Hi , I ’d like to see if you can do me a favor and check back on the guest list for last year . I need the name of someone . ”
48143	48156	48157	48157	She	60	“ Really ? You ’d do that for me ? Thank you ! ”
48161	48172	48157	48157	She	60	“ He ’s helping me find him . Your turn . ”
48173	48179	48185	48185	she	60	“ Did you really call ? ”
48188	48210	48185	48185	she	60	“ Do you want to call back to verify ? Come on . Your turn . Go after him , Bryn . ”
48629	48633	48634	48634	He	64	“ Over there . ”
48646	48651	48652	48652	He	64	“ Penthouse still empty ? ”
48669	48688	48654	48654	his	64	“ Sir , yes . They ’re putting in the finishing touches until they start showing next month . ”
48689	48697	48698	48698	he	64	“ We need shelter for a moment , ”
48714	48733	48734	48734	He	64	“ Of course , sir , go right in . I ’ll be sure you ’re not disturbed . ”
48772	48777	48760	48760	We	1010	“ You own this ? ”
48778	48781	48734	48734	He	64	“ Yes . ”
48782	48789	48790	48790	I	0	“ The penthouse or the building ? ”
48803	48810	48800	48800	I	0	“ Wow . You amaze me . ”
48811	48816	48817	48817	he	64	“ You ’re amazing , ”
48825	48835	48821	48821	He	64	“ Did you take off what I told you ? ”
48836	48839	48840	48840	Flushing	140	“ Yes . ”
48847	48862	48842	48842	I	0	“ Seems right that you take off something too . It ’s only fair . ”
48863	48869	48870	48870	He	64	“ Life is n’t fair . ”
48908	48913	48900	48900	he	64	“ Are we even ? ”
48917	48922	48914	48914	I	0	“ Not even close , ”
49433	49436	49437	49437	I	0	“ Aaric , ”
49705	49717	49699	49699	He	64	“ You ’ve thought of this . Me kissing you here . ”
49718	49721	49699	49699	He	64	“ No . ”
49722	49727	49699	49699	He	64	“ You want this . ”
49728	49731	49732	49732	He	64	“ No … ”
49740	49746	49747	49747	He	64	“ This tells me yes . ”
49842	49857	49858	49858	He	64	“ You ’re beautiful , Bryn . You taste so good , little bit . ”
50432	50442	50443	50443	I	0	“ Aaric , I want to see you too , ”
50741	50750	50751	50751	Sara	60	“ You ’re welcome to stay , Christos , ”
50762	50792	50751	50751	Sara	60	“ He was on his way out . My boss has a big dick . I mean , my boss is an absolute dick . I need my rest . ”
50806	50827	50802	50802	He	64	“ I ’m not your boss , but when you need someone to boss you in bed — call me . ”
50831	50848	50828	50828	He	64	“ You ’re right , you ’re my business partner . You offered up the dough . ”
50849	50858	50880	50880	his	64	“ Maybe you should offer me a nightcap . ”
50859	50870	50828	50828	He	64	“ Christos , come on , my roommate is here … ”
50871	50876	50880	50880	his	64	“ To my disadvantage , ”
50884	50889	50880	50880	his	64	“ Goodnight , bit . ”
50890	50895	50828	50828	He	64	“ Goodnight , Aaric . ”
50908	50913	50901	50901	I	0	“ Do n’t ask . ”
50914	50919	50923	50923	she	60	“ I have to ! ”
50930	50936	50923	50923	she	60	“ Are you two … ? ”
50945	50956	50937	50937	I	0	“ You dared me to go after what I wanted . ”
50957	50960	50937	50937	I	0	“ So ? ”
50961	50966	50967	50967	I	0	“ So I am , ”

51263	51267	51268	51268	he	64	“ Too slow , ”
51271	51285	51268	51268	he	64	“ The second I click , I want it uploaded . No wait . ”
51306	51312	51313	51313	he	64	“ App version coming along ? ”
51318	51324	51313	51313	he	64	“ We have an app ? ”
51343	51354	51340	51340	his	64	“ Yes , bit . We will have an app . ”
51355	51359	51360	51360	I	0	“ Of course , ”
51363	51372	51360	51360	I	0	“ of course we will have an app , ”
51413	51452	51453	51453	He	64	“ Christos , I ’m thinking . We can place sponsor ads discreetly on the free version . Or people can pay for the full version . Every sale sends underprivileged child clothes , food , and books . ”
51458	51474	51475	51475	I	0	“ Because people need it . Just like people need this software in their lives , ”
51503	51509	51495	51495	He	64	“ Are you busy later ? ”
51510	51516	51495	51495	He	64	“ I hoped to work . ”
51517	51528	51495	51495	He	64	“ Would you consider working while having dinner with me ? ”
51529	51537	51538	51538	He	64	“ That would totally not be work . ”
51548	51554	51538	51538	He	64	“ Have dinner with me . ”
51560	51568	51555	51555	I	0	“ I ’d like that very much . ”
51860	51865	51866	51866	I	0	“ This is incredible , ”
51915	51936	51900	51900	his	64	“ I really like the combination of traditional and contemporary of your brownstone . It ’s kind of like you . ”
51937	51942	51897	51897	He	64	“ I ’m traditional ? ”
51943	51969	51900	51900	his	64	“ Part of you . Your desire for a family and stability . But another part of you is cutting edge . The business side . ”
51970	51987	51988	51988	He	64	“ Glad you ’ve discovered those two sides of me . There ’s yet a third . ”
51993	51997	51988	51988	He	64	“ What third . ”
51998	52017	51900	51900	his	64	“ An animalistic , crazy as hell , third side of me that you should run away from . ”
52018	52023	51988	51988	He	64	“ Me or everyone ? ”
52024	52038	52039	52039	He	64	“ Just you . Because you ’re the one who brings it about . ”
52059	52064	52065	52065	he	64	“ Are you hungry ? ”
52068	52071	52065	52065	he	64	“ Starved . ”
52072	52085	52052	52052	He	64	“ Get changed for dinner then , and we ’ll head off . ”
52086	52095	52052	52052	He	64	“ This is all I have to wear . ”
52096	52101	52104	52104	his	64	“ No , bit . ”
52107	52112	52113	52113	He	64	“ It ’s not . ”
52384	52389	52390	52390	I	0	“ I love this , ”
52400	52404	52390	52390	I	0	“ Do you ? ”
52409	52422	52423	52423	He	64	“ That ’s putting it mildly . You look stunning in it . ”
52428	52447	52423	52423	He	64	“ Thank you . I ’m feeling high on emotions , so forgive me if I tear up . ”
52459	52474	52456	52456	he	64	“ You ’re welcome . You deserve it after what I put you through . ”
52475	52483	52484	52484	He	64	“ Your awful vetting , you mean ? ”
52548	52565	52566	52566	he	64	“ You have no clue how much I look forward to taking that off you tonight , ”
52576	52583	52566	52566	he	64	“ I just put it on ! ”
52676	52681	52682	52682	he	64	“ Let ’s go , ”
52967	53033	53034	53034	I	0	“ I ’ve never really opened up to a guy before — about my parents . It ’s so easy with you . I ’ve been scared that you could hurt me . But lately I ’ve been thinking that I do n’t want to be scared anymore . That if anything , you ’re the one guy I ’d trust not to hurt me . ”
53051	53060	53047	53047	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe I did that . ”
53080	53083	53084	53084	He	1081	“ Why . ”
53097	53107	53084	53084	He	1081	“ It was just so impulsive , I just … ”
53108	53113	53114	53114	He	1081	“ Just what … . ”
53360	53398	53358	53358	him	1081	“ Christos , I want you to know that … I’m not playing games here . I know it may seem like that because I ’ve been scared , but I ’m not interested in some fling . ”
53399	53419	53420	53420	He	1081	“ I ’m not planning on this being a fling . I ’m dead serious about you , Bryn . ”
53441	53451	53436	53436	he	1081	“ So no other man for you ? Ever ? ”
53452	53470	53358	53358	him	1081	“ No . I mean I dated for some time , but nothing serious . Not really . ”
53471	53484	53485	53485	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe all those idiots let you slip by . ”
53488	53540	53485	53485	I	0	“ There ’s not many of them , really . I know I seem extroverted but I ’m more introvert , I ’m drained around too many people . I used to think I ’d be more extroverted when I grew up , but I find the opposite is actually true . ”
53548	53567	53568	53568	I	0	“ What about you , do you find you ’re more open to friendships as you get older ? ”
53574	53578	53579	53579	he	1081	“ Not really , ”
53583	53605	53579	53579	he	1081	“ There are friends , then there are acquaintances . I can count the former with the fingers of one hand . ”
53690	53714	53684	53684	We	1087	“ I ’m not the kind of guy that trusts people easily . I keep my circle tight and to only a few . ”
53715	53719	53804	53804	him	1088	“ And Cole ? ”
53720	53769	53684	53684	We	1087	“ I suppose Cole is more open to socializing . He was n’t the one who took care of our mother as closely . When she passed , in a way my being the eldest made me feel responsible for not only myself , but for him too . ”
53770	53779	53684	53684	We	1087	“ His father figure , so to speak . ”
53780	53801	53802	53802	I	0	“ Yeah , well . Without a dad for your whole life , someone needs to step into the role . ”
53806	53815	53802	53802	I	0	“ Do you miss her ? Your mom ? ”
53816	53839	53840	53840	We	1089	“ I do . But I ’d seen her suffer long enough that I know she ’s in a better place now . ”
53847	53858	53859	53859	I	0	“ I was obsessed with death in my college days , ”
53863	53866	53859	53859	I	0	“ Why ? ”
53871	53919	53867	53867	He	1088	“ Because of my parents … when they left on their trip , I never expected I ’d be saying goodbye for the last time . Then I get a call from my Aunt Cecile , and she was crying so hard , she could hardly speak . ”
53929	53934	53935	53935	he	1088	“ I ’m sorry , ”
53938	53944	53935	53935	he	1088	“ I ’m sorry too . ”
53948	53958	53935	53935	he	1088	“ Did I ever thank you for the flowers ? ”
53959	53964	53965	53965	he	1088	“ Thank me later , ”
53969	53983	53965	53965	he	1088	“ Come on , you ’re so not getting laid because of flowers . ”
53994	54003	53988	53988	He	1088	“ You ’re getting laid for other reasons , ”
54031	54043	54044	54044	I	0	“ I was pretty fucked up for the next few months , ”
54047	54097	54044	54044	I	0	“ I kept thinking my time was coming too . I kept waiting for it to happen . It was only when I turned 21 that I finally felt like I should do something with my life and stop waiting . Because it might be a long time coming . ”
54107	54126	54098	54098	I	0	“ My Aunt Cecile died shortly after . It was hard not to fall back into my grief . ”
54135	54144	54127	54127	He	1088	“ So are you a hypochondriac or what ? ”
54145	54159	54160	54160	I	0	“ No ! I mean . No . It just hits you hard . ”
54166	54224	54160	54160	I	0	“ I read this book , Remembrance , by Jude Deveraux , about reincarnation and how we come back over and over and find our loved ones again , so I felt better about that . Like when I met you in high school . I would bet anything that I knew you before in another life . ”
54225	54230	54236	54236	his	1090	“ Who was I ? ”
54248	54252	54236	54236	his	1090	“ Someone crucial . ”
54253	54260	54160	54160	I	0	“ What ? Like your brother ? ”
54261	54268	54269	54269	I	0	“ No ! You know what . ”
54284	54307	54308	54308	he	1090	“ I think knowing all this ends makes it even better , makes every moment count more . Right now this second , ”
54313	54317	54308	54308	he	1090	“ just gone . ”
54318	54329	54330	54330	He	1090	“ Way to kill my enjoyment right now , Christos ! ”
54360	54367	54368	54368	I	0	“ Tell me something about you , ”
54371	54379	54368	54368	I	0	“ What do you want to know ? ”
54380	54388	54332	54332	his	1090	“ How you came to New York . ”
54389	54448	54449	54449	he	1090	“ I do n’t know . I suppose it made sense . I was making millions , and I wanted to exponentially grow . I played with stocks , and real estate was big for me . There ’s no more expensive real estate in the country than Manhattan . Might as well do something before I die , ”
54461	54467	54453	54453	I	0	“ You ’re not nice . ”
54468	54487	54453	54453	I	0	“ I ’ve never been nice . Is n’t that why you never went for me , bit ? ”
54503	54515	54516	54516	I	0	“ I was afraid you were … well , someone crucial , ”
54531	54540	54541	54541	I	0	“ I do n’t regret that I waited , ”
54545	54552	54541	54541	I	0	“ You ca n’t mean that . ”
54553	54571	54520	54520	his	1090	“ I do . Otherwise all this … I’d be missing out on all this . Tonight . ”
54572	54578	54541	54541	I	0	“ You ’re enjoying tonight ? ”
54579	54585	54586	54586	I	0	“ You have no idea , ”
54603	54628	54586	54586	I	0	“ I ’m sorry about your mom . I can tell you still miss her . It makes me want to … hug you . ”
54629	54632	54633	54633	he	1090	“ Huh ? ”
54701	54709	54710	54710	he	1090	“ I can get used to this , ”
54720	54764	54710	54710	he	1090	“ You pervert . I ’m trying to give you the hug I wanted to give you every time I thought of your mom sick and dying and you taking care of her , juggling school and a job , all at once . ”
54772	54788	54789	54789	He	1090	“ It ’s okay . I mean , it hurts , but it ’s okay . ”
54808	54830	54793	54793	his	1090	“ You ’re sweet . Smart , funny . Unique . I think the one who needs a hug is you . ”
54831	54834	54857	54857	He	1090	“ Why ? ”
54835	54853	54854	54854	he	1090	“ You ’re like a four - year - old , why ? Because I say so ? ”
54950	54963	54964	54964	he	1090	“ So when did you get the idea for House of Sass ? ”
54967	54973	54974	54974	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
55002	55057	55058	55058	He	1090	“ I guess a few years after my parents died , after my Aunt Cecile died , and I dropped out of college . I ’m drawn to things you can physically touch . I did n’t consider getting into the tech side of the business until you asked me to make it bigger . ”
55066	55082	55058	55058	He	1090	“ Tech has been big for years , and I see it continuing to be . ”
55083	55161	55058	55058	He	1090	“ I really like the fact that we ’ll have both — a physical store but a virtual advisor . I suppose I was anti - tech for a time simply because I read a study which predicted that , in our future , many of our experiences would be virtual , and what ’s the fun in that ? I mean , a virtual kiss is not like a real one , you ’re kissing air . ”
55162	55201	55253	55253	He	1097	“ That ’d be a business I ’d go for , a virtual experience where you can smell the person you love , touch them , or at least trick your brain into thinking you ’re with them . ”
55202	55217	55218	55218	I	0	“ But you are n’t and you will always know that you are n’t , ”
55274	55285	55253	55253	He	1097	“ Let ’s try it out . Close your eyes . ”
55286	55289	55290	55290	He	1097	“ What ? ”
55348	55356	55357	55357	he	1097	“ Am I touching you or not ? ”
55360	55363	55357	55357	he	1097	“ What ? ”
55381	55396	55397	55397	he	1097	“ Is this my touch , or is it the tip of this pen ? ”
55456	55462	55463	55463	I	0	“ It ’s your finger , ”
55467	55474	55463	55463	I	0	“ Why do you say that ? ”
55475	55478	55479	55479	I	0	“ Because ! ”
55484	55509	55479	55479	I	0	“ You ’re the selfish , possessive type , you would n’t give a pen the pleasure of doing something you want to do . ”
55547	55574	55544	55544	he	1097	“ Newsflash , little bit . The pen has no feelings or pleasure , whereas I do , I ’ll give you that . Which finger ? ”
55575	55586	55544	55544	he	1097	“ I do n’t know . Do n’t mindfuck me . ”
55604	55610	55587	55587	I	0	“ It ’s your pinky . ”
55611	55616	55544	55544	he	1097	“ Are you sure ? ”
55617	55620	55648	55648	his	1097	“ Yes . ”
55621	55624	55587	55587	I	0	“ Positive ? ”
55625	55636	55544	55544	he	1097	“ Yes . Wait … it ’s your middle finger . ”
55637	55642	55643	55643	I	0	“ Open your eyes . ”
55673	55680	55681	55681	he	1097	“ Your instinct was spot on , ”
55684	55693	55681	55681	he	1097	“ Then I blew it . Now me . ”
55701	55709	55710	55710	He	1097	“ Okay , so close your eyes . ”
55988	55994	55995	55995	I	0	“ I need to pee , ”
56085	56092	56093	56093	he	1097	“ Come to bed , bit , ”
56112	56116	56117	56117	he	1097	“ My bed , ”
56198	56202	56203	56203	I	0	“ Come here . ”
56223	56233	56234	56234	he	1097	“ You ’re driving me crazy , you know , ”
56244	56260	56234	56234	he	1097	“ I know . You do the same to me . You ’re a mirror . ”
56261	56284	56237	56237	his	1097	“ Am I ? Can you see how gorgeous you are to me in the way I look at you , huh ? ”
56301	56313	56314	56314	He	1097	“ Can you see how much I want you , bit ? ”
56699	56703	56704	56704	I	0	“ Hold me , ”
57511	57516	57517	57517	He	64	“ You ’re up . ”
57732	57832	57833	57833	I	0	“ Do you think we could eventually expand the software to service men ? I was talking to Jensen and he was complaining about his closet . And I remembered seeing this study proving men ’s capability of decisions diminishes with each small decision taken , which is why many successful businessmen , including yourself , always wear the same shoes , same suits , similar ties , all to simplify the small decisions , so that their big decisions regarding their multimillion - dollar businesses are taken with all the brainpower available . That ’s what you do , ”
57837	57858	57833	57833	I	0	“ So with House of Sass software , even for men , the task of choosing their outfit is removed . ”
57868	57872	57859	57859	He	64	“ Go on . ”
57873	57921	57975	57975	his	64	“ I ’ve also thought of offering skin - color - tone readings from our staff to suggest a complimentary skin - tone palette . The best colors that suit you . We could also have body - shape - style suggestions , suggesting the best cuts . ”
57922	57927	57975	57975	his	64	“ Inventory my closet . ”
57928	57932	57859	57859	He	64	“ Excuse me ? ”
57933	57963	57964	57964	He	64	“ Take my inventory . Let ’s add it to the software when it ’s ready . Let ’s see what you ’ve got for men … like me . ”
57992	58034	58035	58035	He	64	“ What do you think of our representatives visiting the homes of our clients in edgy modern mechanic outfits in blue . Kind of the one you used to wear . We ’re tuning up their closets , it makes sense . ”
58053	58060	58035	58035	He	64	“ I ’m more for suits . ”
58061	58068	58069	58069	He	64	“ You did n’t see yourself . ”
58087	58108	58109	58109	He	64	“ Let ’s stick to basics . The software sells your product , not the mechanic outfit your reps wear . ”
58142	58150	58151	58151	I	0	“ Woody Allen is my favorite director , ”
58155	58163	58164	58164	He	64	“ We should go watch that movie . ”
58174	58182	58164	58164	He	64	“ You like his one - liners ? ”
58183	58213	58164	58164	He	64	“ I like everything . I feel like he ’s the only one doing his own thing , without chasing trends or catering to others . I like that . ”
58214	58222	58164	58164	He	64	“ He lives just down the block . ”
58223	58226	58286	58286	he	64	“ No . ”
58227	58230	58164	58164	He	64	“ Yes . ”
58231	58237	58164	58164	He	64	“ You ’re kidding me ? ”
58238	58248	58286	58286	he	64	“ He plays clarinet at the Carlyle every Saturday . ”
58249	58252	58164	58164	He	64	“ No . ”
58253	58256	58257	58257	he	64	“ Yes , ”
58260	58273	58257	58257	he	64	“ My God ! Annie Hall is like my favorite movie ever ! ”
58274	58280	58286	58286	he	64	“ You want to go ? ”
58296	58306	58286	58286	he	64	“ I ’ll get us premium seating right now . ”
58307	58312	58313	58313	His	64	“ You ’re joking . ”
58335	58342	58343	58343	He	64	“ Yeah . Maybe I am . ”
58355	58364	58343	58343	He	64	“ I guess Saturday night we ’ll see . ”
58387	58438	58439	58439	I	0	“ You know Woody Allen is obsessed with death too ? It ’s really obvious when you watch his movies . I watched a documentary where he talks about it . I suppose it made me feel less alone , like I was n’t the only one thinking those things . ”
58442	58452	58439	58439	I	0	“ Do you feel changed after your mom died ? ”
58453	58466	58467	58467	he	1128	“ Sometimes . I find myself thinking things I never would have , ”
58470	58473	58467	58467	he	1128	“ Like . ”
58474	58498	58499	58499	I	0	“ Like people who have it bad . Like whether we have as much control of our lives as we think we do . ”
58504	58516	58499	58499	I	0	“ Christos , I ’m having a great time this weekend . ”
58517	58521	58522	58522	We	1129	“ So am I. ”

76447	76468	76430	76430	He	1380	“ If I have joint custody , would you be there for my child ? As if it were yours ? ”
76469	76481	76482	76482	I	0	“ I ’d love it as hard as I love you , ”
76502	76523	76492	76492	he	1380	“ I ’m sick of feeling like it ’s wrong to love you because you ’re not mine to love . ”
76524	76529	76530	76530	he	1380	“ I love you , ”
76533	76546	76530	76530	he	1380	“ I want a family , and I want it with you . ”
76560	76620	76552	76552	he	1380	“ It kills me to hurt you when that ’s the last thing I ’ve ever wanted to do . It kills me to let you go because I fucking ca n’t let you go . I ’m choosing you . It ’s always been you . Will you choose me too ? Choose me and my child too ? ”
76640	76645	76646	76646	I	0	“ Are you certain ? ”
76654	76706	76707	76707	He	1380	“ I ’m certain . I have this disjointed idea of being the kind of father I never had . Maybe I even do n’t believe I deserve to have a family , a real family , like I ’d have with you because I failed Leilani and my daughter once . ”
76721	76740	76741	76741	He	1380	“ Maybe why I was settling for Miranda in the first place . Something surface . Nothing real . ”
76798	76835	76836	76836	he	1380	“ We sometimes do n’t get the family we choose , even the kids we have , or how they sometimes come . But you choose who you marry . Who you spend your life with , ”
76951	76961	76962	76962	he	1380	“ Do you want to take this talk elsewhere ? ”
76969	76980	76962	76962	he	1380	“ Preferably after I ’ve had a word with Miranda ? ”
77043	77064	77065	77065	Cole	78	“ Where the fuck were you two ? The evening is a huge success and nobody can find you two ! ”
77100	77105	77106	77106	I	0	“ Hello , Miranda , ”
77170	77174	77175	77175	I	0	“ Nice shoes , ”
77202	77227	77187	77187	Miranda	70	“ Nice tattoo , Miranda . I have a feeling I ’ve seen it before . Maybe at the corporate restroom of Christos and Co. ”
77272	77281	77264	77264	I	0	“ You two . We need to talk , ”
77292	77334	77335	77335	I	0	“ I ’m not marrying you to pretend a happy life . That ’s not what I want to teach my child . I will be there for this child , regardless . As an uncle , or as a father , ”
77353	77368	77369	77369	I	0	“ I was about to let the girl of my dreams go . Jesus ! ”
77394	77401	77385	77385	I	0	“ And you . You motherfucker . ”
77402	77455	77372	77372	She	70	“ Come on , Aaric . You did n’t love her . She ’s insisting the kid ’s yours because she ’s got this idea of you being better than I am . A better father figure . More responsible . She knows you want a family , and I do n’t . ”
77456	77468	77469	77469	I	0	“ Yeah , well now you might get one . Fucker . ”
77487	77527	77476	77476	I	0	“ Do n’t you ever — ever — fuck in my corporate bathroom again . Lock your damn office door — or take it somewhere else . As long as I pay the rent , you screw around elsewhere . ”
77545	77565	77566	77566	Cole	78	“ If it ’s mine , I ’ll be the father you were to me . The damn best , ”
77578	77593	77571	77571	I	0	“ If you do n’t , I ’ll personally make sure that you do . ”
77594	77633	77634	77634	I	0	“ Miranda , hell , I know I ’m a bit more c’est la vie than Aaric , but even if Aaric is the biological father … I can — well , be there for the stepfather role . ”
78009	78022	78007	78007	Cole	78	“ Hey . Just wanted to call and say I ’m sorry . ”
78052	78059	78060	78060	he	78	“ I planned to come through , ”
78063	78071	78060	78060	he	78	“ Why are you apologizing to me ? ”
78078	78090	78060	78060	he	78	“ Because no one should be without the woman he loves . ”
78091	78096	78097	78097	I	0	“ You love Miranda , ”
78105	78111	78097	78097	I	0	“ I meant my brother . ”
78112	78115	78060	78060	he	78	“ Oh . ”
78116	78127	78060	78060	he	78	“ You do love him too . Do n’t you ? ”
78128	78134	78097	78097	I	0	“ Is he all right ? ”
78151	78178	78145	78145	I	0	“ Ha . Better than ever . He said I did him a favor . I should be a good dad like he was to me . ”
78179	78185	78060	78060	he	78	“ So it ’s yours ? ”
78186	78201	78202	78202	he	1401	“ I suspect it is . But we ’ll make sure . Even then … ”
78206	78209	78202	78202	he	1401	“ What ? ”
78210	78213	78214	78214	He	1401	“ Nothing . ”
78217	78228	78214	78214	He	1401	“ You do love my brother , do n’t you ? ”
78229	78232	78233	78233	I	0	“ Always , ”
78236	78255	78256	78256	He	1401	“ Good . I hope you two spend the rest of your lives proving it to each other . ”
78559	78570	78571	78571	I	0	“ Pretty nice all lit up . Is n’t it ? ”
78598	78611	78612	78612	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? How did you find me ? ”
78622	78627	78617	78617	He	64	“ Find my friends . ”
78634	78647	78628	78628	He	64	“ Or should I say , Find the love of my life . ”
78648	78656	78619	78619	his	64	“ You do n’t believe in that . ”
78657	78686	78702	78702	he	64	“ Yes , I do . But I found her too early . Too easy . Maybe sooner than she was ready . Sooner than I was ready . ”
78753	78764	78765	78765	he	64	“ She ’s getting tested as soon as she can , ”
78800	78844	78786	78786	He	64	“ You were right . This has been so hard because the truth I ’ve been trying to accept is wrong . It does n’t matter if I have a child with someone else as long as I want you , love you . “
78881	78908	78868	78868	I.	64	” He takes me by the shoulders and turns me around to face him — his eyes a dark , vivid gold and raw with emotion . “
78976	78981	78973	78973	I	0	” he emphasizes meaningfully , “
78989	78996	78987	78987	you	75	” He shakes his head slowly . “
79035	79041	79042	79042	I	0	” He cups my face . “
79058	79155	79053	79056	The woman I lo	1418	” Anxious , I quiet him with my finger , pressing it to his lips . Then I quickly , almost frantically , rise up on tiptoe , pressing my mouth to my thumb and kissing it . I drop my thumb , and then I ’m kissing him because in the midst of all the what ifs , sometimes you need to make a choice . He takes control and lifts me up , kissing me thoroughly . A couple of tears slip out , sliding down my cheeks as I smile against his mouth . “
79160	79164	79053	79056	The woman I lo	1418	” he says . “
79174	79175	79169	79169	They	1419	” “
79186	79224	79177	79177	I	0	” A tender look sweeps into his eyes as he drinks me in , dries my eyes as if he wo n’t ever have me cry again , and he leans down and kisses me some more . “
79229	79246	79177	79177	I	0	” He eyes my dress , when he eases back to let me catch a breath . “
79251	79258	79177	79177	I	0	” I tease . He smiles . “
79275	79279	79177	79177	I	0	” I admit . “
79296	79309	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” He brushes my mouth , hungry , as he nuzzles me . “
79318	79322	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” I breathe . “
79325	79326	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” “
79333	79338	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” I nuzzle him . “
79343	79344	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” “
79347	79348	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” “
79357	79365	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” I laugh and snuggle into him . “
79380	79388	79282	79284	the right woman	1421	” I stop to touch his face . “
79394	79483	79389	79389	I	0	” Tenderness , it ’s wild and free and raw and primal , and it ’s all in his kiss as he nuzzles my nose with his , melting me before his lips crush mine sort of proprietary , sort of fierce , sort of possessive , sort of exquisitely . He boosts me up by the butt and sets me down on the fountain ledge , bringing me to his eyelevel . I slip my arms around his neck , and he holds me by the waist . “
79552	79581	79582	79582	I	0	” He slides his hand into the back of my neck , his grip possessive on my nape as he squeezes gently , his gaze carving into me . “
79610	79667	79605	79605	Mine	1425	” I nod so fast I get dizzy , and he chuckles as he boosts me down . We start to walk along the park . He looks at me as if he does n’t plan to forget a single feature of my face . We look at each other as if for the first time . “
79676	79684	79605	79605	Mine	1425	” he says , tugging me close . “
79687	79700	79605	79605	Mine	1425	” I shake my head , pressing my cheek to his chest . “
79711	79712	79701	79701	I	0	” “
79725	79739	79740	79740	Babies	160	” He looks down at me and brushes my lips with his thumb . “
79742	79746	79740	79740	Babies	160	” I nod . “
79749	79753	79740	79740	Babies	160	” I nod . “
79776	79783	79784	79784	Bryn	75	” I laugh , cheeks burning . “
79786	79787	79788	79788	Bryn	75	” “
79794	79822	79823	79823	Bryn	75	” he says , cupping my cheek in one big hand and bringing his eyes to look deep into mine , giving me the most devastating grin . “
79833	79833	79830	79830	your	75	”
