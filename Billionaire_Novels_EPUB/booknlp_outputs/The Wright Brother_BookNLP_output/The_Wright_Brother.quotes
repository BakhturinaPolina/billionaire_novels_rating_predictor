3796	3825	3826	3826	Heidi	97	“ Yeah , so they ’re all a bag of dicks . Who cares ? Let ’s go get drunk on their dime and make fun of them . ”

4075	4110	4056	4056	He	87	“ He ’s looking for a paycheck . A paycheck that I ’m going to have to provide because there ’s no way he ’ll be able to take care of our little sister . ”

4396	4430	4390	4390	she	105	“ Do n’t you remember that time she decided she was a princess superhero ? Mom could n’t get her out of a tutu , cape , and crown for almost a year . ”
4459	4488	4489	4489	I	0	“ Yeah , I remember . I ’d be happier about the whole thing with what ’s his face if he was n’t such a completely incompetent dipshit , ”

4504	4519	4520	4520	he	87	“ And you ca n’t fucking talk , man . Your name is Jensen , ”
4531	4541	4520	4520	he	87	“ It ’s a fucking weird name , too . ”
4542	4570	4571	4571	Morgan	105	“ It ’s not a weird name . Maverick is a douche name , especially since he goes by Maverick and not Mav or Rick or something . ”
4584	4598	4577	4577	she	105	“ Let ’s drop it , shall we ? Where is Landon anyway ? ”
4657	4662	4663	4663	Austin	87	“ Hey , Landon , ”

5417	5456	5413	5413	Austin	87	“ I feel like someone should grab Sutton . We ’re about to suffer through a couple of hours of pictures with eighteen of her closest friends . Might have some time , just the five of us . ”
5457	5465	5466	5466	I	0	“ I limited her to nine bridesmaids , ”
5469	5475	5466	5466	I	0	“ That ’s a limit ? ”
5482	5493	5476	5476	Morgan	105	“ I do n’t think I even like nine people . ”
5494	5503	5504	5504	I	0	“ You were n’t in a sorority either , ”
5508	5532	5504	5504	I	0	“ I do n’t like people . I certainly would n’t like to pay for new sisters . Sutton is above and beyond . ”
5621	5632	5633	5633	I	0	“ You want to go see if she ’s decent ? ”
5640	5653	5637	5637	She	105	“ This is what I get for being the only other girl . ”
5801	5807	5808	5808	Sutton	102	“ Hey , y’ all ! ”
5822	5832	5808	5808	Sutton	102	“ Morgan said you needed me for something important . ”
5846	5866	5833	5833	I	0	“ Your brothers tried to drink the bottle before you got here , but I thought , a toast ? ”
5872	5881	5867	5867	She	105	“ You know I ca n’t have that . ”
5905	5910	5900	5900	she	105	“ How about this ? ”
5911	5919	5920	5920	she	105	“ Yes ! Make mine a double , ”
5968	5971	5972	5972	Sutton	102	“ Annnd , ”
5976	5996	5997	5997	She	105	“ while I have you here , Jensen , I wanted to run one teensy little thing by you . ”

6153	6156	6115	6115	I	0	“ No . ”
6157	6165	6115	6115	I	0	“ I did n’t even ask anything ! ”
6166	6182	6098	6098	she	105	“ I know what you ’re going to ask , and the answer is no . ”
6183	6249	6115	6115	I	0	“ But it ’s silly , Jensen . Really ! He ’s the love of my life . We ’re going to spend eternity together . A prenup is ridiculous . It ’s a bad way to enter a marriage . If you ’re thinking about how it ’s going to end before it even starts , then what does that say about a person ? ”
6296	6354	6288	6288	I	0	“ You are worth a small fortune , Sutton . And I do n’t give a fuck who you ’re marrying . You get a prenup to protect yourself in case something happens . Thinking about the future is a way to ensure that you are not getting scammed . No matter how much somebody loves you . ”
6355	6360	6361	6361	Sutton	102	“ But , Jensen — ”
6370	6373	6374	6374	Austin	87	“ Sutton , ”
6380	6410	6374	6374	Austin	87	“ do you really want to do this right now ? I mean , Jensen and Landon both had a prenup . No one marries a Wright without it . ”
6411	6416	6417	6417	I	0	“ That ’s right , ”
6427	6437	6438	6438	Morgan	105	“ Plus , you ’re only twenty - one , ”
6441	6448	6438	6438	Morgan	105	“ Who knows what could happen ? ”
6449	6458	6459	6459	Sutton	102	“ Oh , wow . Thanks , Morgan , ”
6462	6476	6477	6477	she	105	“ I did n’t mean that Maverick is n’t ‘ the one , ’ ”
6483	6504	6477	6477	she	105	“ I just mean , Jensen did n’t think he ’d divorce Vanessa under any circumstances and look what happened . ”
6548	6570	6571	6571	I	0	“ If Maverick really wants to throw out the prenup , I ’d be happy to talk to him about it , ”
6584	6599	6579	6579	She	105	“ I ’m not that stupid . You ’d scare him half to death . ”
6600	6620	6581	6581	her	105	“ Well , if he ’s trying to take you for your money , then he ’d deserve it . ”
6621	6647	6579	6579	She	105	“ Okay , fine . I get it . I just thought I ’d ask . Maverick and I had a long talk about it . ”
6648	6652	6653	6653	Landon	103	“ I bet , ”
6659	6664	6656	6656	his	103	“ Anyway , shots ! ”
6697	6717	6691	6691	I	0	“ To Sutton , on the happiest day of her life and to many more amazing years to come . ”
6770	6781	6782	6782	I	0	“ Heidi , what are you doing to my hair ? ”
6791	6813	6814	6814	She	97	“ I ’m making you look presentable , Em . You just wait . It will come together at the end . ”
7064	7075	7076	7076	Heidi	97	“ I swear , it ’s going to be cute , ”

7145	7184	7142	7142	Heidi	97	“ I got invited because I work for the Wrights and , like , half of the company was invited . It ’s going to be a big wedding . I doubt you ’ll even run into him . ”

7380	7435	7436	7436	Heidi	97	“ If you think for a minute that something is going to happen with him at this wedding , you ’re out of your mind . Not only is he married , but he ’ll also be there with his wife . And , as of today , I ’m officially swearing off men . ”
7439	7446	7447	7447	she	97	“ Yeah , right , Em , ”

8088	8129	8130	8130	Heidi	97	“ Oh my God , if you do that in your dress , you are going to be more than a distraction for Landon . You are going to rip your dress in half for the entire party to see . ”
8135	8149	8130	8130	Heidi	97	“ I ’m going to get dressed , and then we can go . ”
8179	8202	8171	8171	She	97	“ Come on , sexy . You ’re my date tonight . Let ’s get Kimber to take a picture of us ! ”

8502	8507	8508	8508	Heidi	97	“ Done and done , ”

14099	14115	14116	14116	I	0	“ Well , I ’m glad you could make it . Who is your friend ? ”
14164	14167	14168	14168	she	600	“ Heidi , ”

14332	14340	14341	14341	Heidi	97	“ Head of Wright Construction , Em , ”

14365	14377	14378	14378	I	0	“ I promise , whatever you ’ve heard is a lie , ”
14384	14395	14396	14396	she	83	“ I did n’t say I ’d heard anything bad , ”
14414	14425	14399	14399	She	83	“ Seriously … what is it with you Wright brothers ? ”
14426	14430	14431	14431	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
14438	14442	14443	14443	Heidi	97	“ Ignore her , ”
14446	14462	14443	14443	Heidi	97	“ She ’s an old friend , and she just needs another glass of champagne . ”
14481	14489	14478	14478	her	97	“ Give . Him . A. Chance . ”
14538	14543	14544	14544	She	83	“ I ’m just … ”
14556	14563	14564	14564	I	0	“ Mind if I join you ? ”
14567	14570	14571	14571	she	83	“ Sure , ”
14723	14731	14732	14732	I	0	“ I noticed you at the ceremony , ”
14830	14836	14837	14837	She	83	“ Yes . That was … ”
14869	14873	14856	14856	she	83	“ I noticed . ”
14874	14882	14883	14883	I	0	“ Are you in town , visiting ? ”
14905	14919	14886	14886	She	83	“ Look , whatever this is , it ’s not going to work . ”
14925	14934	14886	14886	She	83	“ And what do you think this is ? ”
14935	14943	14970	14970	she	83	“ Honestly , I do n’t know . ”
14944	14952	14953	14953	I	0	“ I ’m just talking to you , ”
14956	14967	14953	14953	I	0	“ I ’m not fooled by that notion , Jensen . ”
15135	15142	15143	15143	She	83	“ Do you have a boyfriend ? ”
15156	15169	15170	15170	She	83	“ I do n’t need a reason to say no to you . ”
15213	15231	15232	15232	I	0	“ I know you do n’t need a reason . But it feels like you have one , ”
15242	15267	15232	15232	I	0	“ Yes , I have a reason . And , when you figure it out , you ’ll no longer be interested in me . ”
15268	15274	15275	15275	I	0	“ I highly doubt that , ”
15281	15303	15275	15275	I	0	“ I swore off the Wright family a long time ago . So , you ’ll have better luck somewhere else . ”
15772	15775	15776	15776	she	105	“ Fuck ! ”
15779	15783	15776	15776	she	105	“ Gimme that . ”
15813	15818	15819	15819	I	0	“ Trouble with Landon ? ”
15827	15834	15819	15819	I	0	“ With Miranda , of course . ”
15847	15853	15835	15835	She	105	“ What happened this time ? ”
15854	15858	15859	15859	she	105	“ Get this , ”
15879	15892	15868	15868	She	105	“ Miranda was pissed because Landon ’s ex - girlfriend is here ! ”
15893	15915	15868	15868	She	105	“ Why would she care if his ex was here ? He ’s married to her , for Christ ’s sake . ”
15916	15923	15924	15924	Morgan	105	“ Well , that ’s Miranda . ”
15927	15933	15934	15934	I	0	“ Yes , it is , ”
15945	15961	15937	15937	I	0	“ She drives me batshit crazy . I do n’t know why they ’re together . ”
15962	15971	15972	15972	I	0	“ Your guess is as good as mine . ”
16623	16629	16610	16610	her	83	“ You were watching me . ”
16630	16636	16637	16637	I	0	“ Is that a crime ? ”
16640	16650	16637	16637	I	0	“ Suppose not . Why were you watching me ? ”
16651	16671	16610	16610	her	83	“ Because you ’re the most beautiful girl in the room , and I like the way you move . ”
16672	16680	16610	16610	her	83	“ Jensen , this could never happen . ”
16681	16686	16687	16687	I	0	“ You mentioned that , ”
16706	16714	16715	16715	she	83	“ Do you know who I am ? ”
16718	16730	16715	16715	she	83	“ Em . And that ’s all I need to know . ”
16789	16792	16793	16793	she	83	“ Fuck , ”
16812	16815	16816	16816	I	0	“ Yes , ”
16819	16839	16816	16816	I	0	“ You tell me to go away yet ask me to come here . What exactly do you want ? ”
16905	16917	16918	16918	she	83	“ I do n’t know . This is a bad idea , ”
16921	16930	16918	16918	she	83	“ Seems like a good idea to me . ”
16936	16945	16931	16931	She	83	“ I ’ve had a lot to drink . ”
16946	16951	16952	16952	I	0	“ Me , too , ”
16960	16972	16952	16952	I	0	“ And , now , I really want to kiss you . ”
17011	17017	17003	17003	her	83	“ But we ca n’t . ”
17018	17022	17023	17023	She	83	“ Ca n’t ? ”
17038	17041	17025	17025	her	83	“ Nope . ”
17042	17049	17050	17050	I	0	“ You want to kiss me , ”
17065	17075	17050	17050	I	0	“ But you ca n’t . Or wo n’t ? ”
17076	17082	17083	17083	she	83	“ Oh , I will , ”
17086	17092	17083	17083	she	83	“ But I should n’t . ”
17366	17373	17355	17355	She	83	“ Jensen … I … we … ”

17489	17523	17486	17486	Margaret	126	“ I hope this is a good time . I got the paperwork in that you need to look over , and you told me to contact you as soon as it arrived . ”
17524	17530	17531	17531	I	0	“ Yes . Thank you , ”
17611	17631	17632	17632	she	126	“ Do you need me to come into the office today to go over this with you , sir ? ”
17635	17662	17663	17663	She	126	“ No , thank you , Margaret . I ’ll look at it in my home office and get back with you about it on Monday . ”
17670	17684	17663	17663	She	126	“ I think they ’re going to want an answer today , sir . ”
17685	17739	17632	17632	she	126	“ They ’ve kept me on the line for five days about this . And I ’ll have to fly there to finish off the negotiations with Tarman . We have another day to wait . Plus , if I can lower their offer , we ’ll all have bigger bonuses this Christmas . ”
17740	17751	17663	17663	She	126	“ Make them wait all you like then , sir . ”
17752	17758	17759	17759	I	0	“ Thank you , Margaret , ”
18123	18127	18128	18128	Landon	103	“ Bad time ? ”
18153	18165	18135	18135	I	0	“ Of course not . Just got bogged down in work . ”
18166	18172	18179	18179	his	103	“ On Sunday , Jensen ? ”
18201	18222	18223	18223	Landon	103	“ Every day . Someone has to run the company . Not everyone gets to play golf on the weekends . ”
18226	18235	18223	18223	Landon	103	“ Every day . Not just the weekends . ”
18236	18243	18244	18244	I	0	“ How ’s your back anyway ? ”
18271	18308	18267	18267	Landon	103	“ It ’s fine . Better anyway . The physical therapist thinks I should n’t be pushing it as much as I have this year , but none of the Wrights know how to slow down . ”
18315	18341	18267	18267	Landon	103	“ As long as you ’re taking care of it , then you ’ll be fine . People can have a professional golf career forever . ”
18342	18350	18351	18351	Landon	103	“ Yeah , I ’m on it . ”
18356	18375	18351	18351	Landon	103	“ Actually , I came over here so early because Miranda and I are going to head out . ”
18376	18379	18380	18380	I	0	“ What ? ”
18385	18395	18396	18396	Landon	103	“ I thought you were staying through the holidays . ”
18399	18415	18396	18396	Landon	103	“ Miranda wants to go back to Florida until Christmas . We ’ll be back . ”
18416	18427	18428	18428	I	0	“ You ’re staying for church today though , right ? ”
18431	18436	18437	18437	he	103	“ I … no , ”
18444	18450	18440	18440	I	0	“ Not even for Mom ? ”
18451	18455	18456	18456	he	103	“ I know , ”
18460	18468	18456	18456	he	103	“ I want to , but Miranda … ”
18513	18526	18507	18507	He	103	“ Speaking of Miranda , I heard she freaked out last night . ”
18539	18557	18527	18527	Landon	103	“ Yeah , bro , my ex - girlfriend Emery Robinson was there . You remember her ? ”
18570	18574	18575	18575	I	0	“ Emery Robinson , ”
18578	18611	18575	18575	I	0	“ Yeah . You know , my high school girlfriend . I did n’t even recognize her , and Miranda was pissed that she had n’t been informed she ’d be there . ”
18612	18619	18620	18620	I	0	“ You did n’t recognize her ? ”
18632	18641	18642	18642	I	0	“ Nope . How fucked up is that ? ”
18656	18659	18642	18642	I	0	“ Fuck . ”
18660	18663	18664	18664	Landon	103	“ What ? ”
18738	18745	18724	18724	I	0	“ Jensen , what ’s up ? ”
18794	18800	18801	18801	I	0	“ Nothing . Hangover headache , ”
18804	18818	18801	18801	I	0	“ Tell me more about Emery . I remember her … only vaguely . ”
18879	18937	18938	18938	He	660	“ We dated in high school for two years , but we broke up on graduation . The last time I saw her was our five - year high school reunion , and we did n’t talk then , and I had no idea she ’d be at Sutton ’s wedding . I guess Heidi invited her . ”
18943	18954	18955	18955	he	660	“ I mean , I did n’t even recognize her ! ”
18958	18967	18955	18955	he	660	“ How could you not have recognized her ? ”
18968	18990	18991	18991	Landon	103	“ When we dated , she was the captain of the soccer team , who liked to skateboard on the weekends , ”
18997	19033	18991	18991	Landon	103	“ Even at prom , she wore her hair up and no makeup . I do n’t know what she ’s been up to in the past decade . We ’re not even Facebook friends . ”
19034	19040	19041	19041	Landon	103	“ And Miranda was pissed ? ”
19044	19076	19041	19041	Landon	103	“ I do n’t know why . I ’m not interested in the girl I dated in high school , who I have n’t seen in years . I married Miranda . ”
19136	19148	19149	19149	Landon	103	“ Is that the real reason you ’re leaving this morning ? ”
19158	19177	19149	19149	Landon	103	“ I do n’t know , man . Probably . She ’s super jealous of all my exes . ”
19273	19284	19285	19285	I	0	“ Are you sure you ca n’t stay for church ? ”
19320	19323	19324	19324	I	0	“ Miranda ? ”
19329	19335	19336	19336	he	103	“ The one and only , ”
19339	19346	19336	19336	he	103	“ I should probably head out . ”
19347	19362	19363	19363	Miranda	109	“ Landon ! Let ’s go ! We have to get on the road ! ”
19378	19400	19369	19369	Landon	103	“ I should probably go . I certainly do n’t want to stand between the two of you in another confrontation . ”
19401	19411	19412	19412	Landon	103	“ Morgan ’s the instigator ; I assure you . ”
19422	19436	19419	19419	his	103	“ You do n’t fool as many people as you think you do . ”
19460	19476	19455	19455	Landon	103	“ I just want you to be happy . Tell me Miranda makes you happy . ”
19477	19480	19481	19481	she	667	“ Landon ! ”
19504	19511	19512	19512	Landon	103	“ You ’re a good brother , ”
19528	19554	19522	19522	Miranda	109	“ Would you hurry up , or would you rather me leave you behind so that you could be with your ex - girlfriend instead ? ”
19558	19584	19522	19522	Miranda	109	“ Come on , Miranda . I ’ve told you a hundred times that I did n’t even know she was going to be here . ”
19585	19610	19611	19611	she	669	“ Well , I ’m sure you ’ll know when we ’re back for Christmas so that you can sneak away and see her , ”
19614	19644	19645	19645	Landon	103	“ Seriously , she ’s just back from college for a few days , visiting a friend . She ’ll be gone before we get back . Calm down , ”
19651	19663	19664	19664	she	669	“ Whatever . Do n’t make me late for the flight , ”
19675	19686	19687	19687	Landon	103	“ I ’ll see you in a couple of weeks , ”
19760	19772	19773	19773	I	0	“ I can not believe you ’re making me do this , ”
19870	19884	19885	19885	Kimber	88	“ You were never going to come over here unless I made you , ”
19912	19921	19888	19888	She	88	“ Do n’t act like you know me . ”
19925	19930	19931	19931	she	88	“ Okay . Done , ”
20001	20011	20012	20012	she	88	“ Well , look what the cat dragged in , ”
20015	20028	20029	20029	I	0	“ Funny , Mom . I ’ve never heard that one before , ”
20035	20050	20029	20029	I	0	“ You ’re not too old to have your ass paddled , young lady . ”
20231	20253	20254	20254	I	0	“ If I ’m not too old for a paddling , that means you ’re not too old either , Mom , ”
20262	20270	20254	20254	I	0	“ Oh , I know , honey . ”
20278	20302	20273	20273	she	702	“ You know , I ’ve been talking to Harry Stevenson across the way , and he used to be a police officer . ”
20303	20309	20310	20310	I	0	“ Oh God , Mom ! ”
20326	20349	20350	20350	she	702	“ Now , where is my granddaughter ? You ca n’t make me feel old by popping out babies , Kimber Leigh , ”
20361	20373	20350	20350	she	702	“ and then not bring them around when you come visit . ”
20374	20392	20434	20435	My mother	291	“ Lilyanne is with Noah . We ’re going to meet up with them at the church . ”
20393	20401	20402	20402	Autumn	128	“ I suppose that will be fine , ”
20410	20420	20402	20402	Autumn	128	“ How am I supposed to spoil her rotten ? ”
20421	20430	20431	20431	Kimber	88	“ You ’re doing just fine at that , ”
20474	20482	20483	20484	my mother	291	“ I ’ve missed you , Emery , ”
20487	20511	20483	20484	my mother	291	“ But , girl , what have you been eating in Austin ? Is anyone feeding you ? You ’re skin and bones . ”
20575	20587	20588	20588	I	0	“ I ’m eating fine . And … I left Austin , ”
20592	20600	20588	20588	I	0	“ I dropped out of the program . ”
20601	20617	20618	20618	Autumn	128	“ Oh . I was really looking forward to having another doctor in the family , ”
20625	20638	20618	20618	Autumn	128	“ Ah , if only I had been guaranteed Noah ’s salary . ”
20639	20646	20647	20647	Kimber	88	“ If only we all were , ”
20650	20663	20664	20665	my mother	291	“ Are you sad about it ? You do n’t seem sad , ”
20704	20744	20700	20700	I	0	“ Nope . I think it ’s the right choice . Just have to get a job and clean out my apartment . I know someone who will sublet it for next semester . At least that ’s covered . ”
20745	20753	20754	20755	my mother	291	“ Maybe you ’ll change your mind , ”
20762	20777	20754	20755	my mother	291	“ Let me put on my Sunday best , and then we can go . ”
20798	20805	20806	20806	she	88	“ It was not that bad , ”
20809	20824	20806	20806	she	88	“ You ’re right . It was n’t . Probably because you ’re here . ”
20825	20838	20792	20792	Kimber	88	“ You ’re so dramatic . She ’s happy you ’re home . ”
20839	20842	20843	20843	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
20852	20856	20843	20843	I	0	“ Maybe so . ”
20857	20865	20866	20866	Autumn	128	“ Okay , all ready to go , ”
20895	20906	20907	20907	I	0	“ Think Harry Stevenson will be able to resist me ? ”
20913	20932	20907	20907	I	0	“ If we talk about your sex life one more time , I will vomit on your floor . ”
20933	20940	20941	20942	my mother	291	“ We could talk about yours , ”
20945	20950	20951	20951	I	0	“ Let ’s not , ”
20986	20997	20998	20998	Autumn	128	“ I heard that you saw the Wright family yesterday , ”

21104	21127	21128	21129	my mother	291	“ If you had told me that you were in town , I would n’t have had to hear it from Barbara , ”
21148	21171	21132	21132	She	291	“ Tina was there , too . She said you looked very pretty , and all the boys were staring at you . ”
21211	21238	21190	21190	She	291	“ Heidi did my hair and makeup . Only reason anyone looked at me all night . You know , Landon did n’t even recognize me . ”
21239	21242	21243	21243	Kimber	88	“ What ? ”
21246	21254	21243	21243	Kimber	88	“ You did n’t tell me that . ”
21255	21278	21285	21286	my mother	291	“ So , funny story , Landon did n’t recognize me , and then his wife showed up and flipped her shit . ”
21279	21284	21285	21286	my mother	291	“ Language , Emery , ”
21678	21681	21682	21682	Noah	95	“ Kimber , ”
21726	21740	21717	21717	Kimber	88	“ Hey , baby girl . Are you excited to see Grandma Autumn ? ”
21741	21749	21750	21750	Lilyanne	89	“ It ’s not autumn , Mommy , ”
21758	21763	21750	21750	Lilyanne	89	“ It ’s winter . ”
21764	21767	21768	21768	I	0	“ Actually , ”
21771	21790	21768	21768	I	0	“ the winter solstice is n’t until the twenty - first . So , it still is autumn . ”
21791	21797	21798	21798	Lily	90	“ But it ’s cold , ”
21801	21805	21798	21798	Lily	90	“ Sound logic . ”
21827	21836	21837	21837	Kimber	88	“ So , tell me about seeing Landon , ”
21846	21858	21837	21837	Kimber	88	“ Shh , Kim , we should n’t gossip in church . ”
21864	21886	21837	21837	Kimber	88	“ It ’s not gossip if it comes from the source . Are n’t you all about firsthand accounts in history ? ”
21887	21916	21837	21837	Kimber	88	“ Meh . Let ’s not talk about history right now . I ’ve thought of next to nothing else for nine years . I need a break . ”
21917	21924	21925	21925	she	88	“ A break like Landon Wright ? ”
21928	21939	21925	21925	she	88	“ Uh , no . Landon is married , remember ? ”
21940	21945	21946	21946	Kimber	88	“ Oh , right , ”
21952	21966	21946	21946	Kimber	88	“ Well , there are a lot of other hot guys in town . ”
21982	21987	21988	21988	he	95	“ What was that ? ”
21991	21998	21999	21999	she	88	“ Oh , shush , you ! ”
22042	22059	22060	22060	Kimber	88	“ I ’m just asking if you are looking for some fun while you ’re here , ”
22066	22075	22060	22060	Kimber	88	“ Speaking of hook - ups in church ? ”
22092	22097	22089	22089	her	88	“ You ’re horrible . ”
22098	22101	22106	22106	She	291	“ Lilyanne ! ”
22159	22167	22168	22168	I	0	“ She sure loves your little girl , ”

22189	22195	22186	22186	Kimber	88	“ Who would have guessed ? ”
22196	22199	22200	22200	Kimber	88	“ Everyone , ”
22207	22216	22204	22204	she	88	“ Look who just walked in the building . ”
22985	22994	22995	22995	he	100	“ Hey . Surprised to find you here , ”
23023	23028	23029	23029	I	0	“ Hey . Yeah , ”
23049	23061	23062	23062	he	100	“ I did n’t realize your family went to church here , ”
23084	23097	23065	23065	His	100	“ Yeah . My mom has been going here since … forever . ”
23098	23110	23111	23111	He	100	“ Right . I did n’t put two and two together . ”
23114	23127	23111	23111	He	100	“ Well , I really came over to apologize about last night . ”
23140	23148	23133	23133	I	0	“ What exactly are you apologizing for ? ”
23172	23176	23177	23177	he	100	“ Everything apparently , ”
23180	23212	23177	23177	he	100	“ I realized that my advances must have been … unwanted . I think I might have pushed you and made you feel … uncomfortable , which was not my intention . ”
23247	23259	23260	23260	I	0	“ You did n’t push your luck . It ’s fine , ”
23305	23316	23302	23302	he	100	“ I assume you ’ve figured out who I am . ”
23317	23321	23322	23322	he	100	“ Emery Robinson , ”
23325	23334	23322	23322	he	100	“ Yes , I know who you are . ”
23335	23346	23347	23347	I	0	“ And see , now , you ’re not interested , ”
23356	23359	23360	23360	he	100	“ Oh , ”
23369	23374	23360	23360	he	100	“ but I am . ”
23451	23469	23432	23432	He	100	“ Perhaps we should take this conversation outside . I try to avoid impure thoughts in church . ”
23520	23523	23526	23526	myself	0	“ Okay , ”
23569	23573	23559	23559	I	0	“ Okay then . ”
23574	23579	23580	23580	I	0	“ Hey , Kimber , ”
23602	23615	23597	23597	she	279	“ I’m … I’m just going to go outside , all right ? ”
23616	23619	23620	23620	she	279	“ Sure , ”
23623	23636	23620	23620	she	279	“ Just , um , come find me when Mom is done . ”
23637	23656	23657	23657	Kimber	88	“ Will do . But … if you get another ride home , that ’s okay , too , ”
23726	23731	23732	23732	I	0	“ Good to go , ”
23754	23759	23760	23760	he	82	“ That ’s it ? ”
23763	23777	23760	23760	he	82	“ What ? Oh , my phone ? Yeah . Purses are annoying . ”
23788	23804	23782	23782	his	82	“ Interesting . Why do you think that ? I thought most women loved purses . ”
23812	23858	23782	23782	his	82	“ Yeah , well , I ’m not most women . I think they ’re pretty , but why would I want to lug something around full of junk that I probably wo n’t need , only to hurt myself by carrying the weight around ? ”
23859	23863	23864	23864	he	82	“ Fair point , ”
23932	23939	23940	23940	I	0	“ This is a little strange , ”
23943	23946	23940	23940	I	0	“ Why ? ”
23955	23967	23968	23968	Jensen	100	“ I do n’t know … because I dated your brother ? ”
23985	23995	23970	23970	his	100	“ That was a long time ago , right ? ”
23996	23999	24000	24000	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
24003	24013	24000	24000	I	0	“ You ’re right . It was forever ago . ”
24014	24024	24025	24025	I	0	“ And you ’re away at school right now ? ”
24065	24086	24087	24087	I	0	“ Away is kind of a loose phrase for someone who has n’t lived in Lubbock in almost ten years , ”
24091	24116	24117	24117	he	100	“ That ’s true , I suppose . It ’s not like many people move back once they ’ve seen the big wide world , ”
24123	24133	24117	24117	he	100	“ Yeah . There ’s a reason for that . ”
24134	24140	24141	24141	he	100	“ What would that be ? ”
24218	24234	24235	24235	I	0	“ Because not everyone has a private jet that can fly them wherever they want , ”
24247	24275	24240	24240	I	0	“ Oh God , you know what ? That was really rude . Definitely rude . I do n’t even know if you have a private jet . ”
24276	24280	24281	24281	he	823	“ I do , ”
24295	24308	24281	24281	he	823	“ Okay . Well , even if you didn’t … still rude . ”
24309	24319	24320	24320	Jensen	100	“ Do you want to go out with me ? ”
24326	24329	24330	24330	I	0	“ What ? ”
24333	24347	24330	24330	I	0	“ I was just rude to you . Why would you want to ? ”
24348	24386	24387	24387	His	823	“ You ’re refreshing . You do n’t have to apologize to me . I ’ve been in your presence for fifteen minutes , and I ’m already certain that I want to continue to do so . ”
24416	24427	24428	24428	I	0	“ But … but you do n’t even know me , ”
24442	24468	24428	24428	I	0	“ That ’s true . However , I would very much like to get to know you , if you ’d let me , Emery . ”
24671	24675	24676	24676	I	0	“ All right , ”
24680	24689	24676	24676	I	0	“ Great . Let me get your number . ”

24757	24760	24708	24708	I	0	“ Tonight ? ”
24761	24768	24769	24769	he	823	“ We could just go now , ”
24772	24786	24769	24769	he	823	“ I do n’t have a free day , but I can rearrange . ”
24796	24805	24769	24769	he	823	“ You want to see me right now ? ”
24806	24814	24815	24815	He	823	“ I am seeing you right now . ”
24822	24830	24815	24815	He	823	“ And I like what I see . ”
24845	24863	24831	24831	I	0	“ Well , I think maybe tonight would be good . Where do you want to go ? ”
24864	24870	24871	24871	he	823	“ I have an idea , ”
24877	24888	24871	24871	he	823	“ Bring a big coat , and wear something comfortable . ”
24893	24910	24889	24889	My	0	“ You do n’t strike me as a wear - something - comfortable sort of date . ”
24911	24921	24922	24922	he	823	“ It ’s the suit , is n’t it ? ”
24925	24930	24922	24922	he	823	“ I suppose so . ”
24931	24943	24889	24889	My	0	“ I have a question . How do you like sleeping ? ”
24944	24951	24952	24952	I	0	“ What does that even mean ? ”
24958	24979	24952	24952	I	0	“ I love sleeping . Does n’t everyone ? Though I did n’t get much of it in grad school . ”
24980	24993	24994	24994	he	823	“ Okay , good . Do n’t plan on getting any tonight , ”
24998	25004	24994	24994	he	823	“ That ’s awfully presumptuous , ”
25076	25092	25072	25072	he	823	“ Big coat and something comfortable . We ’ll see if I ’m presumptuous tonight . ”
25105	25113	25098	25098	he	823	“ I ca n’t wait until then . ”

25244	25247	25248	25248	she	97	“ So ? ”
25253	25274	25248	25248	she	97	“ He ’s smoking hot ! You ’ve already made out with his face . You should so fuck him . ”
25287	25299	25275	25275	I	0	“ Shut up ! We ’re not going to have sex . ”
25300	25311	25312	25312	I	0	“ Sure . Then , why are you wearing that ? ”
25343	25346	25347	25347	I	0	“ What ? ”

25567	25598	25599	25599	I	0	“ Come on , Em . This will be fine . You thought Jensen Wright was sexy as hell since before you had any interest in Landon . Cut loose . ”

27227	27244	27224	27224	he	100	“ Pretty hard to do while you ’re running your own business , I would guess . ”
27359	27376	27350	27350	he	100	“ That would be the main reason . Just too busy to go back to school . ”

36420	36429	36408	36408	I	0	“ She ’s leaving in a few days . ”
36430	36433	36434	36434	Morgan	105	“ What ? ”
36437	36454	36434	36434	Morgan	105	“ No , she ’s not . Landon said she was staying here for a while . ”
36455	36460	36461	36461	I	0	“ He … what ? ”
36469	36556	36461	36461	I	0	“ He tried to tell Miranda that she ’d be leaving soon to get her off his case . But she did n’t believe him , and it turned out , she had a reason . Emery told Landon at Sutton ’s wedding that she was staying here indefinitely . But I mean … I do n’t know why Emery is back in town , but it sure is n’t for Landon . He does n’t even live here . Miranda is out of her mind . ”
36637	36640	36641	36641	I	0	“ Shit , ”
36644	36694	36695	36695	Morgan	105	“ Right ? So , you have to call and convince Landon to bring Miranda here for Christmas . Do whatever you have to , all right ? I mean … I can even call Emery or whatever and ask her to stay away from Landon if that helps … ”
36703	36710	36695	36695	Morgan	105	“ Why have you gone pale . ”
36711	36714	36715	36715	I	0	“ Morg , ”
36723	36728	36715	36715	I	0	“ I fucked up . ”
36731	36746	36747	36747	I	0	“ And he just threw my clothes at me and then drove me home ! ”
36754	36757	36758	36758	Heidi	97	“ Bastard ! ”
36763	36768	36758	36758	Heidi	97	“ What a bastard ! ”
36769	36816	36829	36829	Heidi	97	“ Right ? I mean … we had sex for hours last night , and then this morning , it was like a light switch had been flipped . Walking into this , I just knew it was a bad idea . He totally used me . ”
36817	36828	36829	36829	Heidi	97	“ And it sucked , using him back , right ? ”
36850	36858	36859	36859	I	0	“ Dude , the sex was phenomenal , ”
36867	36896	36861	36861	her	97	“ The turning into a jerk in the morning and dumping me at Kimber ’s , like a dorm - level walk of shame , not so much . ”
36954	36966	36967	36967	Heidi	97	“ Yeah , well , at least you had some fun , ”
36970	36980	36967	36967	Heidi	97	“ That was good for you after Professor McJerkface . ”
36996	37000	37001	37001	Heidi	97	“ Professor McJerkface ? ”
37008	37012	37001	37001	Heidi	97	“ Pretty much . ”
37013	37033	37034	37034	Thoughtfully	156	“ Well , it was a good time . But , you know … it was more than that . ”
37047	37054	37034	37034	Thoughtfully	156	“ I kind of like him . ”
37055	37060	37061	37061	Heidi	97	“ A Wright brother ? ”
37067	37081	37061	37061	Heidi	97	“ Are n’t you President of the Anti - Wright Family Fan Club ? ”
37082	37087	37034	37034	Thoughtfully	156	“ Something like that , ”
37091	37097	37088	37088	I	0	“ But he was different . ”
37098	37107	37108	37108	Heidi	97	“ Oh , boy ! Here it goes , ”
37111	37114	37115	37115	I	0	“ What ? ”
37118	37125	37115	37115	I	0	“ You ’re doing that thing . ”
37126	37130	37088	37088	I	0	“ What thing ? ”
37131	37135	37136	37136	Heidi	97	“ You know , ”
37139	37172	37136	37136	Heidi	97	“ The whole the guy is a jerk , but he ’s different with me . News flash , Robinson , he ’s not different . He just wanted to fuck you . ”
37176	37183	37173	37173	I	0	“ Thanks for that cheery message . ”
37184	37211	37088	37088	I	0	“ Gah , I ’m sorry . I had a weird night , and I worry about you . What happened with Landon was bad enough . ”
37212	37224	37088	37088	I	0	“ You were the one pushing me into Jensen ’s arms . ”
37225	37309	37173	37173	I	0	“ Yeah , but that was before you got all doe - eyed and decided he was different . I like Jensen just fine . He ’s a great boss . He cares about his employees . He knows what he ’s doing , and he makes us all a lot of money . But I ca n’t pretend that he ’s this perfect person either . I ’ve heard that he sleeps around when he ’s at business meetings out of town . ”
37310	37360	37088	37088	I	0	“ Ugh ! I do n’t want to think about it . We ’ve all done stupid things . I do n’t want to judge him . Maybe he ’s just a manwhore , and that ’s what last night was about . But you should have warned me ! ”
37361	37386	37088	37088	I	0	“ I thought you ’d fuck around with him as a nice rebound , Em . I did n’t think it ’d be anything . ”
37387	37394	37395	37395	I	0	“ Well , it ’s not , ”
37399	37443	37395	37395	I	0	“ It ’s definitely not . Remember the whole dropped me off at Kim ’s like he was taking out the trash ? Because I ’m pretty sure , no matter how different he was with me , that asshole sure shone through . ”
37444	37462	37088	37088	I	0	“ Good . That ’s good . I do n’t want to see you get hurt again . ”
37463	37482	37485	37485	her	1045	“ I ’m not going to get hurt . Now , what was this about a weird night ? ”
37499	37525	37489	37489	her	1045	“ Nothing honestly . I had a strange phone call , and I ended up talking to the person all night . It was unexpected . ”
37542	37557	37533	37533	Heidi	97	“ Do you want to go shopping with me and Julia sometime this week ? ”
37558	37570	37489	37489	her	1045	“ Two weeks before Christmas . Your favorite time to shop . ”
37571	37588	37533	37533	Heidi	97	“ All the crowds and sales and screaming — it makes for a great horror flick . ”
37589	37606	37533	37533	Heidi	97	“ Sure , I ’m in . I can never resist a good bit of horror . ”
37615	37618	37619	37619	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
37708	37716	37702	37702	I	0	“ Let me guess … lover boy ? ”
37717	37720	37721	37721	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
37800	37808	37809	37809	I	0	“ What does he have to say ? ”
37817	37825	37809	37809	I	0	“ I ’m way more confused now . ”
37826	37837	37838	37838	Heidi	97	“ He wants to meet you at Kimber ’s bakery ? ”
37844	37857	37838	37838	Heidi	97	“ I ’m sure he does n’t know that she owns it . ”
37858	37905	37809	37809	I	0	“ True , but damn . I wonder what happened in his head . Besides the fact that canceling meetings is so not like him . I ’ve never heard of him willfully canceling a meeting . He must have realized how much he fucked up . ”
37906	37909	37838	37838	Heidi	97	“ Maybe . ”
37910	37917	37918	37918	I	0	“ Or he wants round two . ”
37928	37934	37918	37918	I	0	“ There ’s no way . ”
37935	37945	37838	37838	Heidi	97	“ Well , are you going to meet him ? ”
37946	37953	37954	37954	I	0	“ Did curiosity kill the cat ? ”
37958	37969	37954	37954	I	0	“ Yeah , but it had nine lives and shit . ”
38032	38061	38062	38062	I	0	“ Cupcakes in the morning , cookies in the evening , chocolate at suppertime . When Kimber ’s in the kitchen , you can eat baked goods anytime , ”
38170	38176	38177	38178	a girl	897	“ Can I help you ? ”
38196	38212	38192	38194	a Tech student	1054	“ I ’ll take a snickerdoodle cookie and two of the strawberry macarons , please . ”
38213	38223	38224	38224	Jensen	100	“ And a slice of death by chocolate cake , ”
38241	38248	38224	38224	Jensen	100	“ Jesus , you scared me . ”
38249	38270	38271	38271	he	100	“ I did n’t mean to sneak up on you . I thought you ’d have heard the bell chime , ”
38392	38397	38398	38398	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
38446	38453	38454	38455	the woman	1058	“ Anything else for you two ? ”
38466	38475	38476	38476	I	0	“ I ’ll take a cup of coffee , ”
38479	38484	38476	38476	I	0	“ Make that two . ”
38510	38516	38505	38505	He	100	“ I ’ve got it . ”
38517	38526	38527	38527	I	0	“ I can pay for my own things , ”
38531	38549	38527	38527	I	0	“ I know you can , but I invited you here . So , I ’m paying . ”
38588	38596	38575	38575	I	0	“ I ’ll get us a table . ”
38689	38692	38693	38693	he	100	“ Emery , ”
38696	38699	38693	38693	he	100	“ I … ”
38724	38727	38712	38712	I	0	“ What ? ”
38728	38738	38759	38759	I	0	“ I think I ’ve made a horrible mistake . ”
38739	38746	38712	38712	I	0	“ And what would that be ? ”
38747	38755	38756	38756	he	100	“ Going on a date with you , ”
38775	38788	38759	38759	I	0	“ Well , that ’s just … that ’s wonderful , Jensen . ”
38789	38801	38712	38712	I	0	“ Emery , sit down . Come on , just sit . ”
38802	38808	38809	38809	I	0	“ And why should I ? ”
38821	38856	38809	38809	I	0	“ We had an awesome time last night , and then poof , you turned into an asshole . Then , you invited me here , only to tell me you regret last night ? ”
38857	38862	38863	38863	he	100	“ Emery , please , ”
38891	38896	38875	38875	He	100	“ Let me explain . ”
38904	38908	38897	38897	I	0	“ Explain what ? ”
38909	38955	38956	38956	he	100	“ I thought you were getting your PhD. I thought you said you were still at school in Austin , studying history and European mistresses . That ’s what you told me . That ’s what I thought . But you ’re not doing that , ”
38964	38970	38956	38956	he	100	“ What do you mean ? ”
38971	38982	38983	38983	he	100	“ You ’re staying in town , are n’t you ? ”
38993	39019	39020	39020	I	0	“ How could you possibly know that ? I ’ve told only a handful of people , and even my mom does n’t believe me , ”
39024	39030	39031	39031	he	100	“ Because you told Landon , ”
39037	39043	39031	39031	he	100	“ You talked to Landon ? ”
39047	39051	39044	39044	I	0	“ About me ? ”
39052	39057	39022	39022	him	100	“ Not … exactly . ”
39058	39070	39071	39071	I	0	“ You did n’t tell him what happened , did you ? ”
39079	39131	39071	39071	I	0	“ Look , I did n’t talk to him . Morgan did . His wife is still pissed that you ’re here . Morgan did n’t know about what happened with us . So , no , he does n’t know . And I ’d like to keep it that way . ”
39132	39149	39022	39022	him	100	“ You said … didn’t know . Morgan did n’t know , but she does now ? ”
39154	39162	39150	39150	Jensen	100	“ It was kind of an accident . ”
39163	39171	39172	39172	I	0	“ Oh , for the love of … ”
39178	39204	39172	39172	I	0	“ You do n’t want Landon to find out about your big mistake , but you told Morgan ? Are you out of your mind ? ”
39205	39212	39213	39213	he	100	“ Starting to feel like it , ”
39216	39245	39213	39213	he	100	“ Great . You brought me all the way here to tell me what a big mistake I was and that Landon is probably going to find out . ”
39275	39325	39272	39272	my	0	“ It ’s not like that . It ’s more a matter of principle , Emery . I had a great time , but I do n’t date girls in town . And , if I had known you were staying , I never would have asked you out . ”
39396	39423	39424	39424	I	0	“ I guessed that when you dropped me off this morning . You did n’t need to come here to tell me that to my face , ”
39442	39467	39468	39468	I	0	“ Have a macaron . They ’re my sister ’s favorite . She owns this bakery . She ’d want you to have one . ”
39476	39479	39480	39480	he	100	“ Emery , ”
39522	39529	39509	39509	He	100	“ Emery . Hey , stop . ”
39530	39533	39534	39534	I	0	“ Why ? ”
39537	39550	39534	39534	I	0	“ We had one night together . What am I to you ? ”
39551	39557	39558	39558	he	100	“ I do n’t know ! ”
39563	39596	39558	39558	he	100	“ I do n’t know , all right ? It ’s like some goddamn self - preservation kicked in , and I had to stop this before it got out of hand . ”
39597	39607	39608	39608	I	0	“ How could it possibly get out of hand ? ”
39611	39621	39608	39608	I	0	“ Because being with you breaks all the rules ! ”
39622	39630	39558	39558	he	100	“ Rules are meant to be broken . ”
39631	39636	39637	39637	I	0	“ Not these rules . ”
39640	39669	39670	39670	I	0	“ I have rules , too . I swore , I ’d never look at another person from the Wright family . I decided Wright is n’t right , ”
39679	39685	39670	39670	I	0	“ Yet here we are . ”
39868	39873	39874	39874	I	0	“ How dare you ! ”
39877	39926	39874	39874	I	0	“ You can not send me mixed signals like this , Jensen . Either you want more or you do n’t . I wo n’t play games with you . I ’m tired of being jerked around by men who think that they can do whatever they want . ”
39927	39934	39948	39948	him	100	“ Emery , that ’s not — ”
39935	39939	39940	39940	I	0	“ Save it , ”
39950	39956	39940	39940	I	0	“ I ’ve heard enough . ”
40080	40091	40092	40092	Betty	136	“ Hi , Emery , dear . How are you ? ”
40112	40121	40122	40122	I	0	“ Doing all right . How about yourself ? ”
40142	40158	40159	40159	I	0	“ I ’m just fine . This way . Oh , you know the way . ”
40169	40195	40163	40163	I	0	“ I ’m dreadfully sorry that we ’re closed today . We had to do some maintenance and decided to shut down during the holidays . ”
40196	40199	40200	40200	I	0	“ Maintenance ? ”
40203	40239	40240	40240	Better	158	“ Replace the floors , new roof — that sort of thing . Wright Construction offered to do the whole thing at a discount since we ’re a historic museum . Is n’t that wonderful ? ”
40253	40257	40243	40243	She	136	“ Just wonderful , ”
40271	40282	40243	40243	She	136	“ That Jensen Wright came over to tell me himself . ”
40283	40290	40291	40291	I	0	“ That was nice of him , ”
40297	40302	40303	40303	Betty	136	“ Here we are , ”
40306	40350	40303	40303	Betty	136	“ Thank you for being able to meet with me today . I ’m going to Florida to visit my grandbabies for Christmas , and I wo n’t be back until after the New Year . It would have delayed everything for you . ”
40351	40380	40381	40381	I	0	“ This is great . I appreciate you coming in early for me . Who is going to be here to let people in for the construction crew ? ”
40405	40438	40381	40381	I	0	“ We have a few people who will be here for the holidays . They have keys and can alternate days . But we ’re closed up from Christmas to New Years . ”
40439	40456	40388	40388	Betty	136	“ Well , if you need someone , let me know . I will be around . ”
40457	40486	40487	40487	she	136	“ I ’m sure they would love to work you into the schedule . Let me get you a copy of the key while we ’re at it , ”
40914	40928	40929	40929	I	0	“ I ’m here . I made it . Sorry I ’m late , ”
40935	40942	40943	40943	Heidi	97	“ Em ! Just in time , ”
40946	40959	40943	40943	Heidi	97	“ Tell Julia that she would look smoking hot in this dress . ”
40960	40969	41020	41020	Julia	119	“ It ’s black . I like it . ”
41003	41011	41012	41012	Heidi	97	“ I knew you would say that , ”
41153	41167	41134	41134	she	119	“ It ’s so not me , but I ’ll try it on . ”
41168	41178	41179	41179	I	0	“ Nothing in this store is ever me either , ”
41183	41210	41179	41179	I	0	“ But , if you do n’t try on everything Heidi wants you to wear , then you wo n’t make it out of here alive . ”
41211	41215	41216	41216	Heidi	97	“ Damn straight , ”
41226	41236	41223	41223	her	97	“ Now , let me play dress - up ! ”
41354	41365	41366	41366	Heidi	97	“ Okay , I know it ’s a touchy subject , ”
41374	41382	41366	41366	Heidi	97	“ but can we talk about Jensen ? ”
41402	41405	41395	41395	she	97	“ No . ”
41406	41411	41412	41412	Julia	119	“ What about Jensen ? ”
41439	41444	41445	41445	Heidi	97	“ Can I tell ? ”
41448	41465	41466	41466	I	0	“ Fine , but I ’m not trying on that weird patterned thing you gave me , ”

41486	41502	41503	41503	She	97	“ You ’ve been trying for twenty years . It ’s not going to work . ”
41510	41521	41503	41503	She	97	“ Anyway , Emery went on a date with Jensen . ”
41522	41531	41532	41532	Julia	119	“ Oh , wow ! Was it hot ? ”
41535	41539	41540	41540	Heidi	97	“ So hot , ”
41543	41550	41551	41551	I	0	“ Heidi , can you not ? ”
41554	41557	41558	41558	she	97	“ Sorry ! ”
41561	41596	41558	41558	she	97	“ Anyway , he was a total ass to her afterward , and then he was an even bigger ass by asking her to coffee to tell her the whole thing was a mistake . ”
41597	41605	41606	41606	Julia	119	“ That sucks . Sorry , Emery , ”
41609	41614	41615	41615	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
41619	41688	41615	41615	I	0	“ Really , it was one date . And then … another kiss that meant nothing . He kissed me after telling me how much of a mistake our date was because he does n’t date in town and how it never should have happened because I moved back home . Oh ! And he fucking told Morgan . Now , Landon is totally going to find out . ”
41689	41704	41705	41705	Julia	119	“ And Landon does n’t know you went on a date with his brother ? ”
41713	41723	41708	41708	I	0	“ I ’d like to keep it that way . ”
41798	41808	41809	41809	Heidi	97	“ Yeah , but he ’s still messaging you , ”
41812	41820	41821	41821	Julia	119	“ Then , he must like you , ”
41824	41834	41821	41821	Julia	119	“ Maybe he ’s just … bad at communication . ”
41835	41848	41809	41809	Heidi	97	“ Just what I want in a guy . A bad communicator . ”
41849	41857	41858	41858	Julia	119	“ That ’s not what I meant , ”
41861	41909	41858	41858	Julia	119	“ I mean , what if he is scared of how he feels for you ? You said he did n’t date in town . Maybe it freaked him out when he realized that you were going to live here , and he said things all wrong . ”
41918	41955	41910	41910	I	0	“ Jensen Wright does not say things wrong . He is a businessman . He says what he means and takes what he wants . I feel that I have to take him at face value . ”
41956	41961	41962	41962	Julia	119	“ That seems fair , ”
41965	41982	41962	41962	Julia	119	“ But the real question is it worth always having that what - if with him ? ”
42000	42011	42012	42012	Heidi	97	“ Just go into it with your eyes wide open , ”
42015	42079	42012	42012	Heidi	97	“ You know he has baggage and shit . He ’s a Wright . He ’s filthy rich and sleeps with supermodels and all that . You know his deal . If you can live with him flying to New York every holiday , then who am I to stop you from having some fun ? I just want you to be happy . ”
42080	42089	42090	42090	Julia	119	“ Also , that dress is fucking hot , ”
42166	42171	42172	42172	Heidi	97	“ You need it , ”
42177	42188	42172	42172	Heidi	97	“ I mean , you really , really need it . ”
42202	42217	42189	42189	I	0	“ It ’s three hundred dollars . I do n’t need it that bad . ”
42218	42245	42246	42246	Heidi	97	“ Oh , but you do ! And … I have n’t gotten you a Christmas present yet . So , that can be my present ! ”
42249	42273	42246	42246	Heidi	97	“ Psht ! Are you insane ? I ’m not letting you get me a three - hundred - dollar dress for Christmas . ”
42274	42278	42189	42189	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
42279	42319	42189	42189	I	0	“ Because I could never repay you for a present like that . Anyway , where would I even wear this ? I live in jeans and T - shirts . I would get no use out of it . ”
42320	42323	42324	42324	Heidi	97	“ Actually , ”
42330	42334	42335	42335	I	0	“ Oh no , ”
42341	42359	42335	42335	I	0	“ You ’re about to tell me the real reason we ’re shopping , are n’t you ? ”
42360	42394	42395	42395	My	0	“ There ’s a Christmas party I want you to come to with me and Julia on Friday night . And I thought we could all get our dresses for the party here ! ”
42401	42415	42399	42399	Julia	119	“ Where ’s the party ? I know she wo n’t tell me . ”
42416	42419	42335	42335	I	0	“ Uh … ”
42420	42432	42335	42335	I	0	“ Come on , Em . It ’s just one party . ”
42433	42452	42453	42453	I	0	“ Yeah , and it was just one wedding . Look how well that worked out for me , ”
42457	42482	42453	42453	I	0	“ I think it worked out pretty well . You ’re not thinking about Professor McJerkface , and you had a lot of sex . ”
42493	42497	42490	42490	her	119	“ Professor McJerkface ? ”
42498	42505	42506	42506	I	0	“ It ’s a long story , ”
42510	42516	42517	42517	Heidi	97	“ Okay , picture this , ”
42520	42560	42565	42565	she	97	“ You wear that dress . I do your hair and makeup . You borrow Kimber ’s stilettos , the really fancy Louboutins that crush your pinkie toes . But how can you resist the red - lacquered bottoms ? ”
42571	42613	42565	42565	she	97	“ You walk into the party . All eyes fall on you . You ’re like fucking Cinderella for a moment . And then , poof , your Prince Charming shows up , and voilà , the night has endless possibilities . ”
42614	42618	42619	42619	I	0	“ Oh God , ”
42624	42634	42619	42619	I	0	“ You ’re talking about your office Christmas party . ”
42641	42646	42635	42635	Heidi	97	“ Um … yes . ”
42647	42684	42565	42565	she	97	“ And , when you say endless possibilities , you mean , I trip over my feet in front of Jensen , and he ’s the same jerk he was and laughs at me or something . ”
42685	42691	42748	42748	her	97	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . ”
42692	42710	42711	42711	Julia	119	“ Yeah , really , I do n’t think Jensen would ever laugh at someone like that , ”
42714	42737	42711	42711	Julia	119	“ Plus , it wo n’t suck because , it ’s open bar , and we can all get wasted on champagne . ”
42738	42745	42746	42746	I	0	“ Oh , I like you , ”
42750	42762	42763	42763	Heidi	97	“ See , Em ? ! Please , please , please , ”
42766	42773	42763	42763	Heidi	97	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
42774	42777	42778	42778	Heidi	97	“ Yes ! ”
42787	42794	42795	42795	Julia	119	“ While we ’re at it , ”
42807	42834	42795	42795	Julia	119	“ want to find me something that sexy ? There ’s a Wright brother I would n’t mind looking at me twice in something like that . ”
42835	42838	42839	42839	Heidi	97	“ Landon ? ”
42849	42852	42846	42846	I	0	“ Austin ? ”
42863	42873	42853	42853	I	0	“ Landon does n’t even work for Wright Construction . ”

42884	42889	42880	42880	she	97	“ So , Austin ? ”
42890	42933	42853	42853	I	0	“ I think he ’s scared of me because I work in HR . But he ’s not technically my boss ; Jensen is . I do n’t think we could get in trouble . And I ’m head of HR anyway . ”
42934	42943	42944	42944	Heidi	97	“ Oh , I can find you something , ”
42947	42964	42944	42944	Heidi	97	“ Each of my girls with a Wright brother will be my New Year ’s resolution . ”

43428	43436	43416	43416	I	0	“ How about we skip that part ? ”
43437	43442	43443	43443	Patrick	122	“ Okay , okay , ”
43457	43480	43446	43446	He	122	“ I ’m just imagining you striking out now . I ’ve seen you pick up more girls than most famous athletes . ”
43481	43488	43489	43489	I	0	“ I did n’t strike out , ”
43496	43519	43489	43489	I	0	“ Yeah , y’ all fucked , and then she straight fucked with your head . What were you thinking , man ? ”
43520	43533	43534	43534	I	0	“ I was thinking that things were too complicated with Emery already , ”
43600	43603	43604	43604	Patrick	122	“ Complicated ? ”
43637	43657	43607	43607	He	122	“ Shit ’s not complicated , Jensen . You like her . That ’s why you ’re freaking out . ”
43658	43665	43666	43666	I	0	“ That would be a problem , ”
43688	43730	43680	43680	He	122	“ The problem is with your head , man . Get in good while you can . You do n’t know if things will go south , and stressing about it will only ruin it . Enjoy it while it lasts . ”
43840	43844	43845	43845	Morgan	105	“ Y’all ready ? ”
43932	43937	43938	43938	I	0	“ Yeah . Austin ? ”

44441	44452	44453	44453	I	0	“ Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention ? ”
44493	44543	44488	44488	Heidi	97	“ I do n’t want to take up too much of your time . I just wanted to say thank you so much for all that you do for this company . Every single person in this room is integral to the development and continual progress of Wright Construction . ”
44563	44592	44554	44554	everyone	259	“ Additionally , I wanted to make you all aware that , as of next week , Wright Construction will merge with the Tarman Corporation headquartered in Austin . ”

44851	44887	44912	44912	Emery	83	“ Jensen , you did n’t even tell them that we were n’t downsizing here . You did n’t tell them what the merger meant or that we ’d be getting new employees from Tarman . ”
44888	44897	44898	44898	I	0	“ Then , you tell them , Morgan , ”

45521	45529	45504	45504	He	122	“ I might have heard that somewhere . ”
45553	45568	45537	45537	him	122	“ Last I checked , you did n’t work for me , Miss Robinson . ”
45569	45572	45573	45573	I	0	“ True , ”
45580	45589	45573	45573	I	0	“ Are you going to kick me out ? ”

46628	46664	46625	46625	he	100	“ But I ca n’t get you out of my head . You ’ve taken over my thoughts , my daydreams , my every last desire , and I have n’t slept since that night . ”

48954	48987	48894	48894	he	100	“ Yes . But I have n’t seen you in days , and I ’m not giving up the opportunity . Unless you do n’t want me to be around your niece ? ”
48988	49012	48846	48846	I	0	“ No , it ’s not that . I ’d love for you to come over . I bet Lilyanne would , too . ”

50534	50600	50625	50625	him	1239	“ I did n’t have any joy . I just wish I ’d figured it out sooner . I wish I had n’t needed to be hit over the head to know the program was n’t right . I mean … I’d already completed my comprehensive exams . All I had to do was finish my dissertation and defend it to my committee to pass . ”
50601	50612	50613	50613	he	1239	“ How could you quit if you were so close ? ”
50627	50688	50617	50617	I	0	“ I really did n’t love it . I think I was doing it because one thread kept pulling me back to it . The stress got out of control . I could n’t handle it , and I had to get on anxiety medication . Plus , well , I found out my advisor was sleeping with an undergrad . ”
50689	50692	50693	50693	he	1239	“ Jesus , ”
50696	50706	50693	50693	he	1239	“ What a prick ! Did he get fired ? ”

50746	50753	50754	50754	he	1239	“ You were dating your professor ? ”
50757	50770	50771	50771	I	0	“ Yeah , for almost three years . Welcome to my life , ”
50778	50792	50793	50793	he	1239	“ How long ago did you find out about him cheating on you ? ”
50887	50896	50897	50897	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Two weeks ? ”
50901	50928	50897	50897	I	0	“ Fuck . I ’m sorry about that . And only two weeks ago ? No wonder you did n’t want to go on a date . ”
50942	50950	50929	50929	He	1239	“ Is all of this too soon ? ”
50951	50954	50955	50955	I	0	“ No , ”
50990	51017	51031	51031	his	1239	“ It had been over with Mitch long before I ended it . I just had n’t had the nerve to realize what I really wanted . ”
51018	51026	51027	51027	he	1239	“ And what do you really want ? ”
51042	51050	51027	51027	he	1239	“ Something I ’m really passionate about . ”
51051	51057	51031	51031	his	1239	“ And what is that ? ”
51058	51075	51089	51089	his	1239	“ I ’m really not sure . I think I ’d just like time to decide . ”
51076	51086	51087	51087	He	1239	“ You have all the time in the world . ”
51135	51143	51144	51144	he	1239	“ What are you doing next week ? ”
51150	51157	51144	51144	he	1239	“ Seeing you , I hope . ”

51221	51236	51217	51217	he	1239	“ But I ’d love to have you with me if you could come . ”
51237	51295	51296	51296	Jensen	100	“ I ’ll have to check my schedule at the Buddy Holly Center , but I should be able to do it . Plus , it might be pretty awesome if we drove out there because I need to get the rest of my stuff from my apartment before someone comes to sublet the place in January . ”
51302	51320	51296	51296	Jensen	100	“ We can definitely stop to get your things while we ’re there , but , Emery … ”
51343	51346	51336	51336	his	100	“ Hmm ? ”
51347	51355	51333	51333	his	100	“ We ’re not driving , love . ”

51798	51813	51814	51814	I	0	“ I just suspect that you have a hidden Jacuzzi or something back there , ”
51828	51838	51820	51820	He	100	“ Not quite . It ’s used for business . ”
51839	51844	51845	51845	He	100	“ Much more boring . ”
51887	51890	51880	51880	I	0	“ Cheers . ”

52444	52449	52434	52434	I	0	“ What ? Why ? ”
52450	52473	52474	52474	Jensen	100	“ Well , because it ’s a hot mess . And I need a few minutes … or hours to tidy up . ”
52479	52514	52474	52474	Jensen	100	“ We ’re not wasting hours here . Why do n’t we just get the things you need ? Then , I can have a cleaning crew come through and box everything else up . ”
52515	52530	52434	52434	I	0	“ No way ! I ca n’t let you pay to clean my apartment ! ”
52531	52540	52541	52541	he	1269	“ Fine . Then , let me inside , ”

53881	53928	53875	53875	He	100	“ The last thing you want to do right now is make a scene . The last thing you want is for me to take this up with the president or the provost . I happen to be on a first - name basis with both . ”
53929	53935	53936	53936	Mitch	82	“ Are you threatening me ? ”

57078	57092	57070	57070	she	1370	“ God , I ’m sorry . I should n’t have asked that . ”
57099	57113	57114	57114	I	0	“ It ’s a fair question , considering my background , but no , ”

57152	57167	57114	57114	I	0	“ The woman he was talking about is my ex - wife , Vanessa . ”
57168	57178	57179	57179	she	1370	“ Okay . So , you ’ve been married , ”
57182	57192	57179	57179	she	1370	“ I do n’t follow the Wright family drama . ”
57193	57198	57199	57199	I	0	“ Any of it ? ”
57205	57228	57199	57199	I	0	“ Nope . Kind of swore off the whole bunch . Are you still in love with her ? Is that it ? ”
57229	57251	57261	57261	her	1370	“ No . Vanessa is not the woman for me . If she were , I never would have divorced her . ”
57252	57255	57256	57256	I	0	“ Okay . ”
57329	57350	57321	57321	I	0	“ Emery , I want you and only you . I would never cheat on you . Never , ever . ”

57404	57418	57386	57386	she	1370	“ Because Vanessa cheated on me , and I divorced her for it . ”

57443	57461	57386	57386	she	1370	“ It was nasty , and I ’d never put another human being through something like that . ”

57468	57472	57473	57473	I	0	“ It was , ”
57476	57532	57473	57473	I	0	“ And I ’m not perfect by any means , Emery . I have trust issues . After what Vanessa did , I never thought that I would be open to another person again , but you ’re different . I want to open up to you . It ’s all going to take time . ”
57533	57536	57537	57537	she	1370	“ No , ”
57544	57569	57537	57537	she	1370	“ I was just cheated on . I ’m the one with major trust issues . I just freaked out , and then Marc — ”

57577	57582	57473	57473	I	0	“ I ’ve realized . ”
57583	57651	57652	57652	She	1372	“ Look , I do n’t want you to doubt me . This is the reason I reacted the way I did the first night we were together . I have enough baggage as it is . Though I may not be a hundred percent since the divorce , I know that I ’m better when I ’m with you . You make me a better man . ”
57848	57853	57854	57854	I	0	“ Sorry about that , ”
57862	57866	57867	57867	Marc	174	“ Of course , ”
57881	57903	57867	57867	Marc	174	“ I took the liberty of ordering you a vodka tonic . You do like vodka tonics , do n’t you ? ”

57943	57953	57940	57940	I	0	“ Or tequila shots . Whatever you ’re into . ”
57954	57968	57969	57969	Marc	174	“ No vodka tonic ? I ’m shocked . A girl like you ? ”
57976	57994	57973	57973	his	174	“ Soon , you ’re going to tell me you ’ve never modeled with that pretty face . ”
57995	57998	57999	57999	Abigail	173	“ Marc , ”
58014	58109	58008	58008	I	0	“ Look , it ’s fine . Whatever you ’re doing is fine . Take shots at me all you want . I get you might be upset with Jensen , and you ’re petty enough to try to take it out on me , but I ’m not a vodka tonic – drinking , pretty - faced model . I ’m not anything you think I am . So , keep hurling insults and layered jabs . I can take it . It ’s not going to make a damn difference to me . ”
58178	58196	58172	58172	I	0	“ Can you replace that vodka tonic order with a glass of champagne ? Veuve Brut preferably . ”
58197	58201	58172	58172	I	0	“ Of course . ”
58455	58480	58481	58481	I	0	“ Glad I grabbed this dress from my place before we left or else I would have had to miss that really fun time , ”
58511	58528	58503	58503	He	100	“ I ’m sorry about that . I should have realized it would be a mistake . ”
58529	58533	58534	58534	I	0	“ A mistake , ”
58555	58569	58570	58570	Jensen	100	“ Are you going to tell me what crawled up Marc ’s butt ? ”
58580	58591	58570	58570	Jensen	100	“ Besides the fact that I just bought his company ? ”
58599	58611	58592	58592	I	0	“ It was more than that . I ’m not blind . ”
58618	58636	58612	58612	He	100	“ You ’re right . It ’s a long story . You already know part of it . ”
58637	58643	58644	58644	I	0	“ We have all night , ”
58648	58653	58654	58654	he	100	“ Indeed we do , ”
58670	58687	58654	58654	he	100	“ Tell me about it . I want to know you . I want to understand . ”
58688	58692	58693	58693	He	100	“ All right . ”
58730	58780	58722	58722	Jensen	100	“ Marc and I have known each other a long time . We were always thinly veiled enemies but hopeful friends . Against his father ’s wishes , he ended up at Texas Tech because of their architecture program . We were in the program at the same time . ”
58781	58789	58790	58790	I	0	“ You went to school for architecture ? ”
58795	58803	58790	58790	I	0	“ I thought you majored in business . ”
58804	58873	58722	58722	Jensen	100	“ Yes . My father required I major in business , but I took architecture classes on the side . I believed , as did Marc , that business destroyed the soul , as we had seen it happen with our families . It did n’t build anything . It only tore things down . It never made things better . We were visionaries . We wanted more . ”
58874	58885	58886	58886	I	0	“ Yet you each run your respective father ’s business , ”
58889	58956	58886	58886	I	0	“ I knew I would always have a job at Wright Construction whenever I wanted it . So , post - graduation , I took an internship at an architectural company in New York for a year . Vanessa and I were engaged . My father was furious about the internship , but I had a whole plan . I was going to change the world . ”
58981	59093	58967	58967	his	1392	“ Anyway , long story short , my father died . Left with nothing but his disappointment , I took over the company and moved back to Lubbock . There was n’t another option since Austin was still in college . Landon , as you know , was about to graduate high school . The board needed someone they could trust . They got me . Vanessa stayed in New York . She was … modeling part - time , and things were looking up . We got married that summer . She started modeling full - time , and Marc got my full - time job at the architectural company . ”
59115	59153	59099	59099	I	0	“ Wright did as much business in New York as I wanted . I could have flown there every weekend to see Vanessa , but I did n’t . I was engrossed in work and still grieving . ”
59154	59163	59164	59164	I	0	“ But it was n’t enough for Vanessa , ”
59173	59188	59167	59167	His	1393	“ Never could have been . Then she ended up in Marc ’s bed . ”
59203	59210	59189	59189	I	0	“ That ’s not your fault . ”
59211	59294	59167	59167	His	1393	“ No , it ’s not . It took many years of therapy to realize that it was entirely her fault . She was the one who found solace with Marc . She was the one who could have stopped the whole thing , but she had n’t . She ’d wanted the visionary she had fallen in love with … but I was n’t that man anymore . So , she ’d settled for Marc in the meantime . Second best . ”
59295	59303	59304	59304	Jensen	100	“ Everyone is second best to you . ”
59315	59318	59304	59304	Jensen	100	“ Thanks . ”
59319	59336	59167	59167	His	1393	“ So … why is Marc so bitter when he was the one who did wrong ? ”
59337	59346	59167	59167	His	1393	“ To him , I ruined his life . ”
59347	59352	59167	59167	His	1393	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
59353	59458	59167	59167	His	1393	“ It is . I understand it from his perspective though . He was always in love or obsessed with Vanessa . Whatever the case was , he finally had her , and then she left him again for me . I got the girl . He ended up having to take over his father ’s company . And , now , I ’ve taken that , too . He ’s bitter . But I do n’t , no , I ca n’t sympathize with him . He might find it convenient to blame me , but he ’s the bastard who did this . ”
59459	59489	59513	59513	His	100	“ And you should n’t sympathize with him . I did n’t , and I did n’t even know the circumstances . I ’m glad I snapped at him . ”
59490	59497	59498	59498	Jensen	100	“ God , you ’re amazing , ”
59501	59512	59498	59498	Jensen	100	“ The way you handled dinner , it was brilliant . ”
59595	59600	59601	59601	I	0	“ You think so ? ”
59604	59610	59601	59601	I	0	“ Know so , love . ”
60037	60044	60045	60045	I	0	“ I can feel my heartbeat , ”
60048	60052	60045	60045	I	0	“ Feel it . ”
60065	60070	60071	60071	he	100	“ You ’re welcome , ”
60085	60092	60075	60075	I	0	“ Now , he has manners . ”
60093	60101	60075	60075	I	0	“ Did n’t seem like you minded . ”
60102	60107	60075	60075	I	0	“ Not one bit . ”
60108	60122	60123	60123	he	100	“ Good . Then , maybe you ’ll be up for round two ? ”
60130	60134	60135	60135	I	0	“ Oh God , ”
60141	60147	60148	60148	He	100	“ Let me recover first . ”
60173	60183	60164	60164	He	100	“ How about we use that Jacuzzi for recovery ? ”
60196	60215	60184	60184	I	0	“ Why do I have a feeling that you ’ll make that sexual , too , Mr. Wright ? ”
60216	60226	60227	60227	He	100	“ Everything about you is sexual , Miss Robinson . ”
60237	60254	60227	60227	He	100	“ And I intend to take full advantage of you being naked in my hotel room . ”
60265	60279	60255	60255	I	0	“ Guess I ’ll turn the jets on and get started myself then . ”
60711	60721	60722	60722	I	0	“ God , I ’m going to miss you , ”
60725	60734	60722	60722	I	0	“ Do n’t miss me . Stay here . ”
60740	60747	60735	60735	I	0	“ I ca n’t stay here . ”
60748	60765	60783	60783	He	100	“ Stay here every night you like . I sleep better when I ’m with you . ”
60766	60775	60776	60776	I	0	“ We have not been sleeping at night , ”

60954	60972	60973	60973	Landon	103	“ Cut the shit , Jensen . Just answer the question . What is happening right here ? ”
61010	61017	60998	60998	he	103	“ I meant to tell you — ”
61018	61023	61024	61024	His	103	“ Tell me what ? ”
61051	61058	61041	61041	he	103	“ Are you two … together ? ”
61059	61062	61063	61063	Emery	83	“ Yes , ”
61070	61075	61063	61063	Emery	83	“ we ’re together . ”
61088	61120	61083	61083	he	103	“ I was only gone a couple of weeks . I do n’t understand how this could have happened … and why I was never informed that this was fucking happening . ”
61132	61137	61123	61123	his	103	“ Where ’s Miranda ? ”
61151	61159	61138	61138	I	0	“ Did she come in with you ? ”
61160	61192	61193	61193	he	103	“ Are you kidding me ? After the fit she had when she found out that Emery was still here , you think she ’d have let me fly back alone ? ”
61197	61204	61193	61193	he	103	“ So … she ’s here ? ”
61231	61247	61248	61248	Landon	103	“ She ’s out shopping . Fuck , could you imagine if she was here ? ”
61262	61291	61248	61248	Landon	103	“ Could you fucking imagine ? I came back at your request , and you did n’t even tell me about Emery ? Is this what you wanted ? ”
61292	61295	61296	61296	I	0	“ No , ”
61356	61384	61385	61385	Landon	103	“ I wanted to tell you in advance about Emery so we could talk about this like men and not just get pissed off at each other . ”
61397	61405	61406	61406	Emery	83	“ You know , I should go , ”
61418	61426	61409	61409	She	83	“ It ’s been a long weekend . ”
61495	61500	61501	61501	I	0	“ Are you sure ? ”
61504	61522	61501	61501	I	0	“ Yeah . Um … I should go see my sister . Check in , you know . ”
61523	61533	61501	61501	I	0	“ All right . I ’ll call you later . ”
61534	61539	61540	61540	She	83	“ Yeah , sure . ”
61576	61588	61589	61589	Landon	103	“ So , you ’re fucking my ex - girlfriend now ? ”
61619	61626	61596	61596	his	103	“ It ’s not like that . ”
61627	61664	61665	61665	I	0	“ What is it like exactly ? Gave up on messing around with every girl you came across when you were out of town and decided to dick around with all those in town , too ? ”
61695	61705	61706	61706	I	0	“ I do n’t want to fight with you , ”
61710	61751	61706	61706	I	0	“ Well , you do n’t get to make that choice , Jensen . You walked in here with Emery Robinson . We ’d dated for two years . You knew her when we were in high school , Jensen . ”
61752	61773	61795	61795	he	103	“ I did n’t know her then , and like you , I did n’t even recognize her at first . ”
61774	61778	61795	61795	he	103	“ Like me ? ”
61779	61784	61785	61785	I	0	“ At the wedding , ”
61804	61828	61795	61795	he	103	“ You met her at Sutton ’s wedding ? You ’ve known who she is this whole time and did n’t say anything ? ”
61829	61866	61795	61795	he	103	“ Yes , all right ? Yes . I ’ve known who she was since that next morning . You were the one who told me that she was leaving town after a couple of days . ”
61867	61879	61932	61932	his	103	“ That was n’t an invitation to go and fuck her ! ”
61880	61889	61890	61890	I	0	“ I did n’t take it as one ! ”
61894	61923	61890	61890	I	0	“ I was going to leave her alone , but then we kept running into each other . I ’ve fallen for her , Landon . I have . ”
61924	61928	61929	61929	Landon	103	“ For now , ”
61935	61968	61932	61932	his	103	“ What happens when you ’re tired of her ? We all know you bore easily . You can fool her with whatever you ’re doing , but I know your reputation . ”
61969	61983	61984	61984	I	0	“ Emery does not compare to any other girl I ’ve been with , ”
61987	62001	61984	61984	I	0	“ Comparing Emery to any of my flings is an insult to her . ”
62002	62012	62023	62023	him	103	“ Or is it just an insult to you ? ”
62047	62054	62043	62043	him	103	“ I should have told you . ”
62055	62061	62043	62043	him	103	“ You said that already . ”
62062	62095	62043	62043	him	103	“ I was planning to tell you before Christmas . But I wanted to make sure this was a real thing . I did n’t want you to find out this way . ”
62096	62157	62158	62158	Landon	103	“ Whatever , Jensen . Just admit it . It ’s not that you did n’t want me to find out this way . It ’s that you did n’t want me to find out at all . Everyone else in the family can fuck up , and you solve their problems , but you ca n’t solve your own . ”
62167	62173	62164	62164	his	103	“ You just hide them . ”
62174	62218	62219	62219	I	0	“ That ’s not what I was going to do . I care for Emery . I wanted to make things right . This is n’t a joke to me . And why are you so pissed off anyway ? You ’re married . ”
62223	62241	62219	62219	I	0	“ By the way you ’re acting , I ’d think you still had feelings for Emery . ”
62242	62248	62249	62249	Landon	103	“ Fuck off , Jensen , ”
62278	62303	62273	62273	I	0	“ The breakup was ten years ago , Landon . This is all harsh for someone you ’ve barely spoken to since high school . ”
62312	62319	62304	62304	He	103	“ You do n’t know anything . ”
62330	62353	62320	62320	I	0	“ You went to different colleges . You were going different directions . A lot of couples break up for those reasons . ”
62354	62370	62371	62371	I	0	“ If you believe that is what happened , then you do n’t know Emery . ”
62426	62436	62437	62437	Landon	103	“ And you ’re smarter than this , Jensen , ”
62440	62455	62437	62437	Landon	103	“ You know that you do n’t want to bring her into your mess . ”
62456	62461	62466	62466	Landon	103	“ She already knows . ”
62462	62465	62466	62466	Landon	103	“ Everything ? ”
62469	62473	62474	62474	I	0	“ Not everything , ”
62478	62497	62474	62474	I	0	“ It ’s only been a couple weeks . I ’m trying to ease her into my life . ”
62498	62509	62466	62466	Landon	103	“ You better tell her , Jensen or I will . ”
62510	62518	62466	62466	Landon	103	“ Do n’t threaten me , Landon . ”
62519	62534	62535	62535	he	103	“ Fuck ! You know I wo n’t tell her . Though I should , ”
62541	62560	62535	62535	he	103	“ Emery is a good , kind , and genuine person . She ’s too good for you . ”
62639	62643	62644	62644	I	0	“ Heidi here ? ”
62647	62651	62644	62644	I	0	“ Pool table . ”
62652	62660	62661	62661	I	0	“ Of course . Should have known . ”
62698	62701	62702	62702	I	0	“ Shot ? ”
62705	62710	62711	62711	Heidi	97	“ God , yes , ”
62746	62755	62756	62756	she	97	“ Good to have you back , baby , ”
62763	62780	62756	62756	she	97	“ Now , tell me all about your Wright brother . Is he the right brother ? ”
62791	62801	62781	62781	Heidi	97	“ How many drinks did you have before this ? ”
62810	62815	62805	62805	her	97	“ More than one . ”
62816	62819	62805	62805	her	97	“ Whore . ”
62820	62846	62805	62805	her	97	“ I did n’t know you were back yet ! And Julia is in Ohio or wherever she ’s from . Somewhere cold and snowy . ”
62847	62855	62805	62805	her	97	“ It ’s cold and snowy here . ”
62856	62865	62805	62805	her	97	“ Yeah , sometimes . But not today ! ”
62866	62899	62900	62900	Heidi	97	“ No , not today . But snow is on the forecast for forty - eight of the fifty states next week . Everywhere is cold , except for Florida and Hawaii . ”
62903	62923	62900	62900	Heidi	97	“ If only . Now , tell me about your sexy weekend . There were sexy times , right ? ”
62924	62927	62928	62928	I	0	“ Yes , ”
62931	62978	62928	62928	I	0	“ We ran into my ex - boyfriend , and Jensen bought a million - dollar company from a man who his ex - wife cheated on him with . Then , when we came home , Landon was waiting for us at Jensen ’s house . ”
63001	63006	63007	63007	she	97	“ Oh my God , ”
63010	63017	63007	63007	she	97	“ Oh , phew ! Wow ! ”
63018	63027	62988	62988	She	97	“ What the hell are you laughing about ? ”
63028	63038	63039	63039	Heidi	97	“ Did you not hear how ridiculous you sounded ? ”
63048	63056	63042	63042	She	97	“ I just told you what happened ! ”
63057	63067	63068	63068	Heidi	97	“ Yeah . Yeah , you did . Wow ! ”
63084	63093	63080	63080	I	0	“ God , you ’re such a bitch . ”
63094	63100	63068	63068	Heidi	97	“ You love me anyway . ”
63101	63104	63105	63105	I	0	“ True , ”
63108	63117	63118	63118	Heidi	97	“ So … Landon is back in town ? ”
63145	63162	63133	63133	I	0	“ Yeah . He just got into town with his wife . Not so great timing . ”
63163	63173	63121	63121	Her	97	“ Did you see Miranda ? Was she there ? ”
63174	63187	63121	63121	Her	97	“ Nah . Lucky for us . Sort of , I guess . ”
63188	63196	63197	63197	I	0	“ Yeah . She ’s a nutjob . ”
63200	63217	63197	63197	I	0	“ That ’s true . But Landon got upset when he saw Jensen and I together . ”
63218	63246	63121	63121	Her	97	“ Landon is a big boy . He ’s a grown - up and married and living halfway across the country . He should n’t be upset . ”
63247	63250	63251	63251	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
63254	63315	63251	63251	I	0	“ But you did n’t see his face when he saw us together . I know I have n’t talked to him in forever , but I feel bad for Jensen that we did n’t tell him . After all , he ’s his brother and , we probably should have said something when we realized things were getting serious . ”
63316	63319	63251	63251	I	0	“ Serious ? ”
63320	63328	63329	63329	I	0	“ I guess we ’re official now , ”
63357	63370	63349	63349	Heidi	97	“ Okay . Well , we definitely need to toast to that . ”
63531	63534	63535	63535	I	0	“ What ? ”
63555	63561	63538	63538	I	0	“ Do n’t hate me . ”
63562	63570	63571	63571	I	0	“ Oh God , I already do . ”
63631	63638	63639	63639	I	0	“ Did you invite him here ? ”
63642	63660	63639	63639	I	0	“ Well , he texted me to find out where you were … and ta - da . ”
63661	63671	63672	63672	Landon	103	“ You ’re right . I do hate you . ”
63749	63752	63753	63753	he	1439	“ Hey , ”
63769	63772	63753	63753	he	1439	“ Hi . ”
63773	63778	63779	63779	Heidi	97	“ Hey , Landon ! ”
63796	63806	63786	63786	His	1439	“ Hey , Heidi . Thanks for the info . ”
63807	63818	63819	63819	She	97	“ For sure . Why do n’t you two just … ”
63834	63839	63840	63840	Landon	103	“ Do you mind ? ”
63859	63870	63871	63871	he	1439	“ Emery , I did n’t mean to ambush you , ”
63876	63886	63871	63871	he	1439	“ Why not ? I kind of ambushed you . ”
63892	63897	63887	63887	He	1439	“ Not on purpose . ”
63898	63901	63917	63917	him	1439	“ True . ”
63902	63909	63910	63910	I	0	“ I just wanted to apologize . ”
63949	63957	63934	63934	They	101	“ You want to apologize to me ? ”
63958	63978	63934	63934	They	101	“ Yeah , I just saw you there … with him … and I kind of blew a gasket . ”
63979	63984	63934	63934	They	101	“ I noticed that . ”
63985	63994	63934	63934	They	101	“ Which I had no right to do . ”
64065	64072	64073	64073	I	0	“ How are you and Jensen ? ”
64091	64100	64079	64079	his	103	“ I needed some time to cool off . ”
64101	64109	64110	64110	I	0	“ So , you came to me ? ”
64115	64137	64110	64110	I	0	“ Do n’t think we were ever the cool - off type . I think we argued most of the time . ”
64138	64146	64147	64147	he	103	“ Only so we could make up , ”
64161	64176	64153	64153	I	0	“ You know , Jensen and I did n’t mean for it to happen . ”
64177	64186	64187	64187	he	103	“ I do n’t really want to know , ”
64195	64213	64187	64187	he	103	“ It might have been ten years , Emery , but it ’s still weird to me . ”
64214	64223	64153	64153	I	0	“ It ’s weird to me , too . ”
64224	64230	64231	64231	Landon	103	“ Just … be careful , ”
64249	64306	64234	64234	He	103	“ I love my brother . But he ’s an asshole , and he ’s bad with women . Plus , he has more baggage than the rest of our family combined , and I think one Wright has hurt you enough for a lifetime . I would n’t want to see you like that again . ”
64319	64387	64307	64307	I	0	“ I know about Jensen ’s reputation and his past . I know that he has n’t always made the right decisions with women . But that does n’t necessarily mean that he ’s going to fuck this up , too . If I thought he was playing me , I would n’t be in his life . This is me we ’re talking about , Landon . ”
64388	64392	64393	64393	he	103	“ I know , ”
64396	64405	64393	64393	he	103	“ That ’s what I ’m afraid of . ”
64413	64456	64406	64406	I	0	“ You know what ? I ’ve had enough crap for one weekend . I apologized for not telling you about Jensen , but I ’m not leaving him because of it . And I ’m not being naive about our relationship . ”
64457	64466	64406	64406	I	0	“ I do n’t think you know him . ”
64467	64472	64473	64473	I	0	“ You ’re right , ”
64476	64510	64473	64473	I	0	“ I definitely do not know him like you do . How could I ? But that does n’t mean I do n’t care for him and want to get to know him . ”
64511	64523	64524	64524	I	0	“ I just do n’t want to see you get hurt . ”
64535	64548	64524	64524	I	0	“ It ’s about ten years too late for that , Landon . ”
64590	64599	64600	64600	he	103	“ That ’s fair . I deserve that , ”
64603	64654	64600	64600	he	103	“ Let me take care of myself . I ’ve been doing it long enough without your help . So , why do n’t we go and play some pool with Heidi and hang out for a while ? I ’d love to see Heidi hustle you like old times . ”
64676	64717	64662	64662	He	103	“ Okay , but I do n’t have that long . Miranda is almost finished shopping . It would be bad for both of our health if she found us in the same place , let alone at a bar . ”
64718	64726	64727	64727	I	0	“ She seems a bit … controlling , ”
64738	64749	64727	64727	I	0	“ I really do not want to talk about her . ”
64756	64759	64727	64727	I	0	“ Okay . ”
64760	64770	64771	64771	Heidi	97	“ What do n’t we want to talk about ? ”
64843	64846	64847	64847	Landon	103	“ Miranda , ”
64851	64857	64847	64847	Landon	103	“ Is she coming here ? ”
64867	64872	64861	64861	her	97	“ God , no . ”
64873	64912	64913	64913	I	0	“ We ’re trying to make sure everyone makes it out of this alive . I mostly want to see you kick Landon ’s ass in pool . So , hop to . Make this happen for me , ”
64928	64937	64922	64922	Her	97	“ You rack , and I ’ll break . ”
64938	64945	64946	64946	he	103	“ I ’d expect nothing less , ”
65410	65418	65403	65403	Morgan	105	“ Maybe you should let it go . ”
65429	65466	65419	65419	I	0	“ I ca n’t just let it go . Landon is out there , pissed off at me . Emery is n’t answering my calls . What the fuck am I supposed to do , Morgan ? ”
65467	65478	65403	65403	Morgan	105	“ I do n’t know . You made this mess . ”
65479	65487	65403	65403	Morgan	105	“ Well aware of that . Thanks . ”
65488	65516	65419	65419	I	0	“ Look , I ’m not patronizing you . But you knew this was going to happen . You knew that you would have to tell Landon . ”
65517	65523	65524	65524	I	0	“ And I planned to , ”
65535	65545	65524	65524	I	0	“ Then , you should have just done it . ”
65546	65551	65552	65552	I	0	“ You ’re right , ”
65558	65566	65552	65552	I	0	“ Do you have Heidi ’s number ? ”
65570	65574	65567	65567	Morgan	105	“ I might . ”
65575	65580	65524	65524	I	0	“ I need it . ”
65581	65584	65524	65524	I	0	“ No . ”
65585	65589	65590	65590	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
65594	65632	65590	65590	I	0	“ Emery is not answering your calls for a reason , Jensen . Give her some time . I ’m sure that she is freaking out about all of this . No one likes to be ambushed . ”
65633	65642	65524	65524	I	0	“ So , I should let her walk ? ”
65643	65676	65677	65677	I	0	“ That ’s not what I ’m saying . I ’m saying , give her space . If you were the one freaking out , would you want her to bombard you ? ”
65738	65761	65762	65762	Morgan	105	“ Normally , no , but right now , I ’m considering going to her house to see if she ’s there . ”

65786	65842	65783	65783	I	0	“ This also has nothing to do with me or Patrick . Stop projecting . I can not believe I ’m even having this conversation with you . With Austin , sure . He ’s the one who fucks everything up . He even fucked up whatever was going on with that girl in HR . ”
65843	65846	65847	65847	I	0	“ Julia ? ”
65850	65855	65856	65856	Morgan	105	“ They were together ? ”
65859	65890	65891	65891	She	105	“ They ’re not anymore . But I thought you were always the one who had your shit together . Austin always has trouble with women . Landon has Miranda . ”
65894	65922	65891	65891	She	105	“ Enough said . But your life is put together , even with everything going on with Vanessa . Why are you acting crazy over one girl ? ”
65923	65964	65965	65965	I	0	“ I care about her . And I care about Landon . I do n’t want to see either of them hurt . Not knowing is making me feel insane . I have to go out there and do something . ”

66367	66381	66362	66362	she	88	“ Hey , Kimber . I did n’t mean to wake you up . ”
66382	66404	66405	66405	She	88	“ Oh , you did n’t . It ’s almost time , and it makes it kind of hard to sleep . ”

66485	66523	66461	66461	I	0	“ Heidi is a bit of a bad influence . Love the girl to death and back , but they ’re trouble together . I ca n’t even tell you what they went through in high school . ”

66530	66555	66407	66407	her	88	“ Do you want me to give her a call and see where she is ? I did n’t even check before she left . ”

67713	67725	67726	67726	I	0	“ As if the key would magically appear in a purse , ”
67740	67759	67726	67726	I	0	“ It ’d be full of other junk I did n’t need . I ’d never find it . ”

68308	68341	68261	68261	Kimber	88	“ He would n’t say , but he seemed concerned . And , since I just saw you with his brother and your ex - boyfriend , I could see his concern . ”
68342	68407	68261	68261	Kimber	88	“ Whoa ! Wait a second , Kimmy . Reel that mom voice back in . There ’s so nothing going on with me and Landon . He just apologized to me for blowing up on me when he found out about Jensen . He played pool with Heidi . We had a few drinks . He drove us both home . No big . ”
68408	68427	68428	68428	I	0	“ All right . What do I know ? Just happily married with no drama in my life . ”

72464	72472	72441	72441	his	100	“ I ’ve been in New York . ”
72473	72486	72441	72441	his	100	“ Why have n’t you answered any of my calls or messages ? ”
72487	72493	72494	72494	he	100	“ I ’ve been busy , ”
72513	72565	72566	72566	I	0	“ I ’m missing something here . What the hell happened ? Is it because I did n’t answer your calls that night ? My phone died , and I did n’t see you ’d called until I got home . I called you back as soon as I charged it , ”
72570	72576	72566	72566	I	0	“ Not as soon as . ”
72577	72585	72586	72586	I	0	“ What the hell does that mean ? ”
72593	72608	72609	72609	He	100	“ I really do n’t want to get into this with you , Emery . ”
72624	72629	72617	72617	I	0	“ Was it Vanessa ? ”
72639	72645	72630	72630	Jensen	100	“ What do you mean ? ”
72646	72662	72663	72663	I	0	“ Do you still love her ? Is that why you were in New York ? ”
72696	72705	72691	72691	him	100	“ You ask me that after last week ? ”
72706	72712	72713	72713	I	0	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
72734	72771	72723	72723	He	100	“ I saw you with Landon . I saw the way you were all over him that night . Landon is still in love with you , and it sure looked like you felt the same . ”
72802	72810	72811	72811	I	0	“ That is not what you saw ! ”
72815	72821	72811	72811	I	0	“ Save it , Emery . ”
73360	73366	73367	73367	she	109	“ You ’re an idiot , ”
73370	73374	73375	73375	I	0	“ Not now , ”
73378	73397	73375	73375	I	0	“ Yes ! Right now . I ’ve waited all week for this . Why wait another minute ? ”
73416	73426	73405	73405	she	109	“ Fine . Let ’s do this somewhere else . ”
73427	73430	73431	73431	she	109	“ Fine , ”
73434	73438	73431	73431	she	109	“ Outside then . ”
73506	73514	73515	73515	I	0	“ All right , we ’re outside , ”
73518	73530	73515	73515	I	0	“ What is it that you have to say to me ? ”
73531	73542	73579	73579	she	109	“ You ’re being such an incredible idiot right now . ”
73543	73548	73549	73549	She	109	“ You mentioned that . ”
73555	73564	73549	73549	She	109	“ I ca n’t do this , Jensen . ”
73565	73571	73572	73572	I	0	“ Ca n’t do what ? ”
73582	73631	73579	73579	she	109	“ You do n’t trust me . You do n’t value my opinion . You could n’t even bother to talk to me . You ran at the first sign of trouble . Then , when things got tough , you went to see your ex - wife . ”
73632	73645	73549	73549	She	109	“ This has nothing to do with Vanessa . You know that . ”
73646	73649	73650	73650	she	109	“ How ? ”
73653	73720	73650	73650	she	109	“ How could I know that ? Do I know anything at all about what the hell this is about ? You ’re pissed about Landon . Then , you ran to your ex , and you expect me to not care about that ? Look at how you reacted when you thought something had happened with Landon . I have every right to be upset . ”
73721	73725	73726	73726	I	0	“ You do , ”
73777	73799	73769	73769	She	109	“ But it does n’t change what I saw or how you feel about Landon or how Landon feels about you . ”
73800	73823	73824	73824	she	109	“ Oh my God , give it a rest ! I do not love Landon , and Landon does not love me , ”
73827	73834	73824	73824	she	109	“ I know what I saw . ”
73835	73923	73769	73769	She	109	“ No , you do n’t . You really do n’t . You have never given me a chance to explain what you think you saw . I ca n’t sit around and let you walk all over my heart , Jensen . I put myself out there after I ’d been hurt . And then , at the first sign of trouble , you ditched me . And all of it could have been fixed with one little conversation that you refused to have with me . ”
73924	73949	73769	73769	She	109	“ If you think that one conversation will magically change everything , then tell me what I saw . Tell me what really happened . ”
73950	74033	73824	73824	she	109	“ Look , the night you saw me with Landon was in no way romantic . He came to apologize to me for being a dick when he found us together . Then , Heidi and I got drunk , and he offered both of us a ride home . I was too drunk to walk to the front door , so he helped me . I got inside and immediately called you . The end . That ’s the whole story . ”
74034	74043	73769	73769	She	109	“ And you were all over him because … ”
74044	74110	74111	74111	I	0	“ One , I was not all over him . Two , I was drunk , and I ’m not a good drunk . I ’m a face - plant - into - the - concrete - and - bust - my - nose - and - get - two - black - eyes kind of drunk . Trust me , I ’ve been there . ”
74122	74130	74131	74131	I	0	“ That ’s really all that happened ? ”
74179	74182	74183	74183	she	1582	“ Yes ! ”
74188	74254	74183	74183	she	1582	“ And you would know that if you had bothered to pick up the phone . Go ask Landon . Go ask Heidi ! She was in the car that night . If anything , I think that Heidi might be into Landon . Not me ! I do n’t understand what I did to make you not trust me , but I hate this . ”
74255	74258	74259	74259	I	0	“ Emery , ”
74268	74272	74273	74273	she	1582	“ Save it , ”
74285	74290	74291	74291	I	0	“ You ’re right , ”
74302	74306	74295	74295	She	1582	“ I am ? ”
74307	74315	74295	74295	She	1582	“ Yes . I am an idiot . ”
74316	74327	74295	74295	She	1582	“ Well , that ’s very obvious at this point . ”
74328	74386	74387	74387	Her	1582	“ What I ’m trying to say is , I was so afraid of losing you that I pushed you away . I made assumptions . It did n’t help that Landon had said that , if I did n’t know what had really happened in your breakup , then I did n’t know you at all . ”
74393	74398	74399	74399	she	1582	“ He said what ? ”
74402	74415	74399	74399	she	1582	“ Oh , I ’m going to kill him , I swear . ”
74416	74429	74430	74430	I	0	“ What I ’m saying is that I want a second chance , ”
74438	74465	74430	74430	I	0	“ I do n’t want to argue with you , and I do n’t want to run . I was an idiot . A complete idiot . ”
74466	74472	74473	74473	she	1582	“ I do n’t know , ”
74483	74495	74473	74473	she	1582	“ How do I know that this wo n’t happen again ? ”
74496	74561	74562	74562	She	1582	“ You do n’t . But I do n’t know how else to make this right . We both have pasts . We both have issues . Trust is mine . After what happened in my past , I have a hard time taking anyone at face value . But I ’d really like to try to handle everything together . To start over . ”
74565	74568	74562	74562	She	1582	“ Jensen … ”
74569	74579	74588	74588	She	1582	“ Give me a chance , Emery . Please . ”
74638	74641	74642	74642	she	1582	“ Okay , ”
74646	74656	74642	74642	she	1582	“ One chance , Jensen . That ’s it . ”
74693	74700	74701	74701	I	0	“ You wo n’t regret it , ”
74719	74726	74707	74707	She	1582	“ I hated the last week . ”
74727	74739	74713	74713	her	1582	“ Me , too . I hated being away from you . ”
74740	74748	74749	74749	I	0	“ Why are you such an ass ? ”
74752	74760	74749	74749	I	0	“ Ca n’t seem to help it . ”
74761	74770	74713	74713	her	1582	“ God , we ’re so fucked up . ”
74771	74774	74713	74713	her	1582	“ Emery ? ”
74775	74778	74713	74713	her	1582	“ Hmm ? ”
74779	74789	74790	74790	She	1582	“ What really happened with your breakup with Landon ? ”
74804	74811	74812	74812	I	0	“ You really want to know ? ”
74815	74844	74812	74812	I	0	“ Yes . I would like to be on equal footing . Figure things out together . That way , maybe neither of us will be blindsided again . ”
74845	74849	74850	74850	She	1582	“ All right . ”
74862	74935	74850	74850	She	1582	“ Landon and I had dated nearly two years when he got into Stanford on a golf scholarship , and I got into Oklahoma as a National Merit Scholar , but both of us wanted to stay home and go to Texas Tech , so we could be together . We had this whole plan . Then … as far as I know , your father told him to go to Stanford . ”
74936	74940	74941	74941	I	0	“ No way , ”
74944	74969	74970	74970	She	1586	“ My father wanted nothing more than for all of us to go to Texas Tech , just like him and all our relatives . ”
74973	75020	74970	74970	She	1586	“ I was there . This is what happened . He thought Landon should be more serious about school and about sports . He wanted Landon to go to Stanford and try to walk onto the football team , which Landon did n’t want to do . ”
75021	75030	74850	74850	She	1582	“ That at least sounds like my father . ”
75031	75116	75117	75117	I	0	“ Yeah . Landon was a good football player , but he always preferred golf . He got into a huge argument with your dad one night right before the deadline where we both had to decide where we were going to school . His dad said that he needed to break up with me or something like , if I was so important , then we could make it work long distance . As you know , your dad died shortly after that . ”
75129	75149	75123	75123	I	0	“ Landon felt … responsible for what happened . As if that argument had pushed him over the edge . ”
75150	75159	74850	74850	She	1582	“ He was n’t and it did n’t . ”
75160	75222	74850	74850	She	1582	“ I knew that ; I still know that . But the last thing that he ever said to your dad was something mean , and he could n’t cope . He accepted the full ride to Stanford because that ’s what your dad had wanted , and I took the Oklahoma spot . Then , Landon was just … gone . ”
75223	75226	74850	74850	She	1582	“ Gone ? ”
75227	75305	74850	74850	She	1582	“ Adrift . I tried to bring him back and to help , but he disappeared those next couple of weeks before graduation . We were still together . I knew he still loved me , but he was broken . So , he broke up with me the day of graduation . He told me that he ’d talked it over with his family — with you — and you ’d all agreed it was best . ”
75306	75330	74850	74850	She	1582	“ We never talked about this . He told me that you were going to different colleges , and you ’d grown apart . ”
75331	75343	75344	75344	She	1587	“ Well , I see now that you did n’t know . ”
75348	75443	75344	75344	She	1587	“ But , as you can imagine , as an eighteen - year - old , I was heartbroken . He still loved me . I still loved him . I knew he was only doing this because of what happened to your father . I tried calling him and messaging him and emailing him . No answer . He just disappeared off the face of the planet . I know he got my messages . He never blocked me . He knew how much I was hurting and ignored it . Sound familiar ? ”
75493	75498	75484	75484	I	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
75499	75503	75504	75504	she	1588	“ I know , ”
75507	75559	75504	75504	she	1588	“ But , as you can see , history repeating itself was n’t so good on my psyche . Landon made his choice all those years ago . I know he did what he thought was right . I just hated all of you for a long time because of him . ”
75615	75628	75629	75629	Emery	143	“ So , since we ’re being all open and honest now , ”
75637	75649	75629	75629	Emery	143	“ Did you see Vanessa when you were in New York ? ”
75650	75654	75655	75655	I	0	“ I did , ”
75729	75751	75718	75718	I	0	“ But I did n’t go there to see her , and absolutely nothing happened . I was there for business . ”
75752	75764	75777	75777	She	1591	“ Landon said it was complicated between the two of you . ”
75765	75773	75774	75774	I	0	“ It is . Vanessa is complicated , ”
75800	75808	75809	75809	I	0	“ But it ’s not like that , ”
75813	75836	75809	75809	I	0	“ I told you once that I could never be with her after what had happened , and that has n’t changed . ”
75837	75846	75777	75777	She	1591	“ Then , why did you see her ? ”
75847	75861	75917	75917	She	1591	“ We ’re divorced , but not … disentangled . It ’s complicated . ”
75862	75865	75809	75809	I	0	“ Disentangled ? ”
75877	75913	75914	75914	I	0	“ I ’m working on the disentangling , part of the reason I went up there . Plus , I was selling off a part of Tarman . I bought the company to dismantle it , ”
75941	75949	75950	75950	she	1591	“ That ’s not really an answer , ”
75954	75961	75950	75950	she	1591	“ Why did you see her ? ”
75962	75973	75921	75921	her	1591	“ She still lives in my apartment in New York . ”
75974	75985	76003	76003	her	1591	“ Why the hell would you let her live there ? ”
75986	75994	75995	75995	I	0	“ This is part of the disentangling , ”
76006	76011	76000	76000	I	0	“ And nothing happened ? ”
76012	76017	76018	76018	I	0	“ Emery , no , ”
76022	76029	76030	76030	she	1591	“ I know , I know , ”
76037	76061	76034	76034	her	1591	“ I should trust you in return . If you said it ’s not like that , then it ’s not like that . ”
76150	76155	76156	76156	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
76175	76238	76167	76167	I	0	“ I knew , even while I was doing it , that what I was doing was wrong . I just … fuck , I was just so angry . I felt like I was going through the same shit again . But , this time , I would not just be hurting the woman I love but my brother , too . ”
76239	76242	76243	76243	she	1591	“ Love ? ”
76253	76258	76246	76246	Her	1591	“ You love me ? ”
76259	76264	76265	76265	I	0	“ Oh , Emery , ”
76293	76300	76281	76281	I	0	“ Of course I love you . ”
76572	76580	76581	76581	Heidi	97	“ Why do you look so nervous ? ”
76600	76606	76607	76607	I	0	“ I ’m not nervous , ”
76610	76616	76617	76617	Julia	119	“ Yes , you are , ”
76662	76674	76675	76675	Heidi	97	“ Things are rocky , and you have turtle head now , ”
76678	76682	76683	76683	I	0	“ Turtle head ? ”
76689	76709	76710	76710	Heidi	97	“ Yeah , you ’re crawling back into your shell because you ’re worried he ’ll fuck up again , ”
76713	76723	76710	76710	Heidi	97	“ I ’m not worried . I ’m cautious . ”
76729	76735	76726	76726	her	97	“ Yep . Turtle head . ”
76736	76743	76744	76744	I	0	“ Would n’t you be cautious ? ”
76747	76753	76754	76754	Heidi	97	“ I do n’t know , ”
76760	76776	76754	76754	Heidi	97	“ He abandoned me for a week . I ’m trying to take it easy . ”
76777	76786	76787	76787	Heidi	97	“ Just try to have fun , okay ? ”
76830	76833	76834	76834	Julia	119	“ Good , ”
76837	76851	76834	76834	Julia	119	“ Now we need to find someone for me to kiss at midnight . ”
76852	76858	76859	76859	Heidi	97	“ Oh , me too ! ”
76862	76865	76859	76859	Heidi	97	“ Landon ? ”
76880	76889	76872	76872	Heidi	97	“ What ? No ! He ’s married ! ”
76890	76897	76834	76834	Julia	119	“ What if he was n’t ? ”
76898	76908	76872	76872	Heidi	97	“ Then he ’d be your ex - boyfriend . ”
76909	76918	76872	76872	Heidi	97	“ I ’m dating his brother , Heidi . ”
76919	76942	76946	76946	her	97	“ Nuh - uh . No way . This is girl code we ’re talking about ! Sacred shit here , Em . ”
76971	76989	76990	76990	Heidi	97	“ Well , you know I ’m good for that kiss at midnight for the both you . ”

77086	77089	77078	77078	Heidi	97	“ Always . ”
77146	77154	77140	77140	She	89	“ Mom ! My boyfriend is here ! ”
77163	77174	77160	77160	Kimber	88	“ We are going to need to break that habit . ”
77181	77189	77175	77175	Jensen	100	“ How are you doing , munchkin ? ”
77190	77198	77199	77199	she	89	“ Fine . Thank you for asking , ”
77203	77212	77199	77199	she	89	“ We should have another ice cream date . ”
77213	77217	77218	77218	he	100	“ We should , ”

77464	77471	77488	77488	Jensen	100	“ Oh , yeah . Twice . ”
77472	77482	77450	77450	Jensen	100	“ Then , nope . No prom for you . ”
77483	77487	77488	77488	Jensen	100	“ Fair enough . ”
77554	77558	77559	77559	I	0	“ Mariah Carey ? ”
77562	77569	77559	77559	I	0	“ You ’re playing Mariah Carey ? ”
77570	77589	77617	77617	He	100	“ Look , I know she made a fool of herself , but she is our singer now . ”
77590	77604	77617	77617	He	100	“ Oh my God , it ’s ‘ Always Be My Baby . ’ ”
77605	77608	77559	77559	I	0	“ And ? ”
77609	77616	77617	77617	He	100	“ This is a good choice . ”
77690	77695	77696	77696	He	100	“ More , please . ”
77705	77722	77696	77696	He	100	“ Do n’t get face - plant - on - the - concrete drunk on me . ”
77723	77730	77731	77731	I	0	“ I ’m a good girl , ”
77734	77741	77731	77731	I	0	“ Do n’t bet on it . ”
77755	77770	77742	77742	Jensen	100	“ Now , before we get there , I do have your Christmas present . ”
77771	77790	77791	77791	We	1618	“ My what ? But it ’s New Year ’s and I thought we were n’t exchanging gifts . ”
77813	77826	77791	77791	We	1618	“ Yes . Then , fine , your New Year ’s present . ”
77827	77837	77838	77838	Jensen	100	“ But I do n’t have anything for you . ”
77846	77854	77855	77855	He	100	“ I absolutely do not need anything . ”
77924	77931	77932	77932	he	100	“ Go on . Open it , ”
77988	77993	77985	77986	my Forester	1064	“ I ca n’t … ”
77994	78003	78039	78039	him	100	“ It ’s a present . You can . ”
78004	78009	78010	78010	I	0	“ Wow . Okay , ”
78013	78021	78010	78010	I	0	“ Will you put it on me ? ”
78084	78095	78075	78076	the man	1620	“ Thank you . It ’s really too much though . ”
78096	78110	78111	78111	I	0	“ Emery , for you , it ’s never going to be enough . ”
78129	78143	78111	78111	I	0	“ A girl could get used to this if you ’re not careful . ”
78144	78208	78209	78209	I	0	“ I ’m not planning on being careful . Kid gloves are off . You might have to endure fancy dinners and random presents and unplanned trips on my private jet . This is the man I am , Emery , as much as the man I am when I ’m with you . I ’d like to have you in both worlds . ”
78319	78322	78323	78323	Morgan	105	“ Oh ! ”
78326	78333	78323	78323	Morgan	105	“ He gave you the necklace . ”
78340	78343	78334	78334	I	0	“ Yes . ”
78344	78351	78323	78323	Morgan	105	“ It looks great on you . ”
78352	78356	78334	78334	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
78357	78385	78386	78386	I	0	“ I ’m so glad things are going well again . Jensen gets so cranky when he ’s being a total idiot and refuses to admit it . ”
78393	78403	78404	78404	I	0	“ I ’m glad things are going well too , ”
78410	78429	78404	78404	I	0	“ Also , I ’m so happy that you ’re here . Seriously . The whole family is . ”
78443	78463	78430	78430	I	0	“ I think I ’m just going to slip to the restroom while Jensen waits in that outrageous line . ”
78464	78468	78469	78469	Morgan	105	“ All right , ”
78472	78482	78469	78469	Morgan	105	“ Do you want me to come with you ? ”
78483	78499	78502	78502	I	0	“ Nah , I ’m okay . I ’ll just be back in a minute . ”
78562	78567	78568	78568	I	0	“ Oh ! Sorry , ”
78577	78586	78587	78587	she	1058	“ Just the person I was looking for , ”
78615	78620	78610	78610	I	0	“ Have we met ? ”
78621	78640	78641	78641	She	1058	“ We have n’t had the pleasure . I ’m glad to rectify that . I ’m Vanessa . ”
78682	78688	78664	78664	she	1058	“ Vanessa , as in … ”
78689	78696	78699	78699	she	1058	“ Yes , Jensen ’s Vanessa . ”
78823	78830	78831	78831	I	0	“ What are you doing here ? ”
78834	78845	78831	78831	I	0	“ Well , I came here to be with Jensen . ”
78846	78856	78857	78857	I	0	“ Too bad . He ’s here with me , ”
78865	78870	78871	78871	she	1058	“ Ah , yes , ”
78896	78905	78871	78871	she	1058	“ Are you the flavor of the week ? ”
78906	78942	78887	78887	she	1058	“ Nope . I ’m his girlfriend . So , you should probably just leave . I do n’t want to have to deal with you when we ’re having a perfectly good night together . ”
78943	78946	78947	78947	Vanessa	111	“ Girlfriend , ”
78969	78983	78966	78966	I	0	“ Believe what you want to believe . I really do n’t care . ”
78984	79001	79002	79002	My	0	“ But how could you be his girlfriend when he stayed with me all last week ? ”
79028	79049	79022	79022	he	100	“ I knew he was in New York and that he saw you . I doubt he stayed with you . ”
79050	79068	79069	79069	she	111	“ I saw you walk in here with him , but he never even mentioned you once , ”
79078	79122	79069	79069	she	111	“ Jensen told me he saw you and that there was nothing there . I know that you cheated on him . I know that he divorced you for it . If you came here for a catfight , consider me tapped out . ”
79190	79199	79200	79200	My	0	“ But did he tell you about Colton ? ”
79216	79223	79224	79224	Vanessa	111	“ Of course he did n’t , ”
79231	79240	79224	79224	Vanessa	111	“ Because you ’re clearly just a fling . ”
79286	79298	79299	79299	Vanessa	111	“ Just face it . You could never compare to me , ”
79309	79321	79299	79299	Vanessa	111	“ How could you compare to the mother of his son ? ”
79326	79333	79334	79334	I	0	“ She should be back already , ”
79493	79502	79503	79503	I	0	“ What could be taking her this long ? ”
79510	79533	79506	79506	Austin	87	“ Do n’t know , man . There ’s probably just a line . You know how the girls ’ restroom is . ”
79534	79539	79540	79540	I	0	“ Right , line , ”
79698	79701	79702	79702	I	0	“ Hey , ”
79728	79734	79735	79735	she	83	“ I want to leave , ”
79747	79753	79735	79735	she	83	“ Emery , what happened ? ”
79754	79762	79763	79763	she	83	“ I said I want to leave , ”
79770	79781	79763	79763	she	83	“ Okay , okay . I ’ll get your coat . ”
79838	79843	79830	79830	she	83	“ Let ’s go . ”
79844	79850	79851	79851	I	0	“ Emery , what happened ? ”
79876	79883	79865	79865	I	0	“ Please , talk to me . ”
79895	79903	79904	79904	I	0	“ Why do n’t you ask Vanessa ? ”
79911	79914	79904	79904	I	0	“ Vanessa ? ”
79915	79929	79930	79930	My	0	“ Yes , your ex - wife . She can help you out . ”
79937	79942	79930	79930	My	0	“ She ’s here ? ”
79943	79949	79950	79950	she	83	“ What do you think ? ”
80107	80116	80097	80097	Emery	83	“ I ’m leaving with or without you . ”
80117	80121	80122	80122	I	0	“ With me , ”
80126	80129	80130	80130	she	111	“ Fine , ”
80147	80155	80138	80138	Vanessa	111	“ Hey , where are you going ? ”
80156	80163	80138	80138	Vanessa	111	“ What are you doing here ? ”
80164	80173	80138	80138	Vanessa	111	“ I came to see you , baby . ”
80174	80212	80138	80138	Vanessa	111	“ Colt was supposed to come tomorrow with the nanny . That is what we agreed on . Not that you would come here and bombard my girlfriend at a party that I never invited you to ! ”
80213	80236	80237	80237	she	1659	“ Well , you forgot to mention this fling to me , so I thought I would come spend time with you , ”
80247	80289	80237	80237	she	1659	“ Vanessa , just fucking stop . You know I do n’t want to spend time with you , and you ’ve clearly offended my girlfriend . I love her , and I choose her . Just her . Only her . ”
80339	80364	80323	80323	she	1659	“ I think you ’re scum on the bottom of my shoe . I wish you would stop trying to ruin my fucking life . ”
80365	80368	80369	80369	she	1659	“ Jensen , ”
80378	80392	80369	80369	she	1659	“ You ’re in my life for one reason , Vanessa . One . ”
80399	80414	80393	80393	I	0	“ Colton . That ’s it . Otherwise , you can go to hell . ”
80492	80500	80484	80484	She	83	“ I already called for a cab . ”
80501	80509	80510	80510	I	0	“ No . We have the limo . ”
80524	80529	80510	80510	I	0	“ I ca n’t — ”
80530	80563	80589	80589	She	1666	“ Emery , please . I do n’t know what Vanessa said , but she is just trying to get between us . There is nothing between me and Vanessa . Nothing . ”
80564	80572	80573	80573	she	1666	“ She said you have a son , ”
80642	80646	80647	80647	I	0	“ I do , ”
80654	80661	80647	80647	I	0	“ I do have a son . ”
80672	80723	80664	80664	her	1666	“ I can not believe this . You knew that I did n’t know ! That I stay out of your family ’s drama . I gave you a million opportunities to tell me . This whole second - chance business , and you did n’t think I should know ? ”
80724	80748	80761	80761	I	0	“ It ’s not that , Emery . I was going to tell you . I ’d been planning to tell you tomorrow . ”
80810	80889	80803	80803	Vanessa	111	“ Well , you blew it . Vanessa is here . She ’s in Lubbock . She found me and cornered me and tried to make me feel worthless . And you know what ? She did n’t succeed . She said some horrible things , but I knew where you and I were , and I was giving us a chance . But then I found out … nope , you were n’t giving us a chance . ”
80919	80924	80916	80916	her	83	“ You take it . ”
80925	80928	80929	80929	I	0	“ Please , ”
80932	81025	80929	80929	I	0	“ Please just let me explain . I gave you the opportunity to explain . Give me that same chance . We said we ’d try this together . I want to do this together . After we talk , if you think I ’ve relinquished our second chance , then I ’ll just … drop you off at home . But I wo n’t let you go . I ’ll keep fighting for us because you are the only woman I have ever met who has made me feel like this . ”
81271	81284	81261	81261	She	1674	“ Why did n’t you tell me that you had a son ? ”
81285	81398	81261	81261	She	1674	“ We ’ve only been dating a couple weeks , and I ’m a very private person . I wanted to make sure that this was the real deal . I do n’t introduce people to my son who are going to leave his life . I do n’t think it ’s fair to him . Since he lives in New York with Vanessa , that ’s where his life is . I fly to New York all the time actually . Nearly every single holiday and at least once a month so I do n’t have to uproot his life . I ’m fortunate enough to be able to do that . ”
81399	81411	81412	81412	she	1679	“ So … you thought that I would leave your life ? ”
81415	81427	81412	81412	she	1679	“ Honestly , until this week , I did n’t know . ”
81448	81502	81443	81443	she	1679	“ But I changed my mind this week and wanted to make it right . Colton was supposed to fly in tomorrow with the nanny so that you could meet him . I had no clue that Vanessa was going to show up unannounced or why she decided to come a day early . ”
81503	81514	81515	81515	she	1679	“ I think she made it perfectly clear to me , ”
81518	81539	81515	81515	she	1679	“ I promise there is nothing going on with me and Vanessa . Our relationship centers entirely around our son . ”
81540	81552	81443	81443	she	1679	“ I just hate that I found out from someone else . ”
81553	81562	81563	81563	I	0	“ I was planning on telling you tomorrow , ”
81569	81576	81577	81577	she	1679	“ Too little , too late , ”
81580	81617	81577	81577	she	1679	“ Honestly , Emery , I was going to tell you tomorrow . I wanted to get through our date and have an amazing time with you . I even gave you my mother ’s necklace . ”
81636	81645	81630	81630	her	1679	“ You gave me your mother ’s necklace ? ”
81646	81701	81702	81702	Emery	83	“ Yes . Morgan and Sutton have most of her pieces , but she left me a few . She wanted them to go to the woman I loved , and I gave one to you . I ’m sure that ’s why Vanessa freaked the fuck out . She ’s seen it before . ”
81715	81728	81702	81702	Emery	83	“ And you really did n’t know that she would be here ? ”
81729	81752	81753	81753	I	0	“ No . Fuck , no . I do n’t want her here . She obviously just wanted to fuck with me . ”
81758	81780	81753	81753	I	0	“ You told me that you wanted to do these things together . I was going to give you that opportunity . ”
81781	81795	81796	81796	she	83	“ I think it ’s sweet that you wanted me to meet him , ”
81800	81848	81796	81796	she	83	“ but I do n’t know why you would n’t tell me before I met him , like … I do n’t know … the day you said you saw Vanessa in New York . You were clearly there to see Colton , not her , right ? ”
81852	81856	81849	81849	I	0	“ I was . ”
81857	81952	81796	81796	she	83	“ Yet you did n’t tell me . You told me the whole story about Vanessa cheating on you with Marc , how your ex - wife and Cheaterpants horribly ruined your life , but you left out the part where you had a son in the mix of it all . It ’s like I know only half of your story . I got the abridged version of the book . You could have told me at anytime , and you did n’t . Did you think that I would n’t be understanding ? ”
81953	81956	81957	81957	I	0	“ No , ”
81961	81969	81957	81957	I	0	“ Emery , that ’s not it . ”
81981	82040	81972	81972	her	1680	“ I think I just need to cope tonight , Jensen . I do n’t fault you for having a son . I love Lilyanne , and now , I understand why you ’re so good with her . But I just fear that you ’ll never really trust me . Maybe you ’ll never trust anyone again . ”
82207	82210	82211	82211	she	1680	“ Kimber , ”
82234	82246	82226	82226	She	1680	“ Hey ! What ’s going on ? Is everything okay ? ”
82257	82281	82282	82282	She	1680	“ Yes . Yes . I ’ll be right there . Do you need anything ? Okay . Do n’t worry about it . ”
82293	82300	82301	82301	I	0	“ She ’s gone into labor ? ”
82304	82322	82301	82301	I	0	“ Yes . I need to get home , so I can drive over to the hospital . ”
82323	82328	82282	82282	She	1680	“ What about Lilyanne ? ”
82329	82336	82282	82282	She	1680	“ My mom is watching her . ”
82337	82349	82301	82301	I	0	“ Then , I ’ll have the limo drop you off . ”
82350	82353	82282	82282	She	1680	“ No — ”
82354	82361	82362	82362	I	0	“ We ’re going straight there , ”
82365	82368	82369	82369	she	1680	“ Okay , ”
82468	82476	82477	82477	she	1680	“ Thank you for dropping me off , ”
82480	82490	82477	82477	she	1680	“ You ’re welcome . Tell Kimber good luck . ”
82491	82495	82496	82496	She	1680	“ I will . ”
82512	82518	82496	82496	She	1680	“ You should keep this . ”
82519	82525	82496	82496	She	1680	“ It was a gift . ”
82526	82552	82553	82553	She	1680	“ It ’s your mother ’s . I only want you to give it to me if this works out . And , right now … ”
82567	82572	82553	82553	She	1680	“ Right now what ? ”
82591	82599	82582	82582	I	0	“ What does this mean for us ? ”
82605	82627	82602	82602	her	1680	“ I do n’t know . I ca n’t think right now . I just need to be with my sister . ”
82628	82638	82639	82639	I	0	“ I understand . That ’s what ’s important . ”
82648	82660	82639	82639	I	0	“ We ’ll figure the rest of this out another time . ”
82661	82664	82665	82665	she	1680	“ Yeah , ”
82672	82676	82665	82665	she	1680	“ Another time . ”
83000	83003	83004	83004	I	0	“ Fuck , ”
83075	83080	83081	83081	I	0	“ Knock , knock , ”
83108	83111	83112	83112	she	88	“ Hey ! ”
83119	83124	83112	83112	she	88	“ You made it . ”
83125	83130	83088	83088	Kimber	88	“ I made it . ”
83131	83136	83112	83112	she	88	“ Are you okay ? ”
83137	83151	83152	83152	I	0	“ Totally . I ’m so excited to finally meet the little one ! ”
83170	83182	83183	83183	Noah	95	“ Well , it ’s still going to be a while , ”
83186	83210	83183	83183	Noah	95	“ Water has n’t even broken , but she ’s dilated and having contractions at a regular interval . Same as last time . ”
83211	83222	83248	83248	I	0	“ I ’m here for an all - nighter then . ”
83223	83244	83245	83245	Kimber	88	“ You look like you came straight from a party . Did you give up your midnight kiss for me ? ”
83285	83323	83274	83274	I	0	“ Meh . Do n’t worry about it . I know you brought a couple of extra outfits . I ’ll just steal your clothes and send Mom back with more when I take over for Lily . ”
83324	83333	83334	83334	Kimber	88	“ You are going to send Mom here ? ”
83348	83363	83338	83338	I	0	“ Now , you admit your true feelings ! She ’s crazy , right ? ”
83364	83381	83338	83338	I	0	“ I do n’t need coaching ! I already have two doctors . Sorry , Noah . ”
83382	83387	83338	83338	I	0	“ No offense taken . ”
83388	83391	83392	83392	Kimber	88	“ Ohhh ! ”
83462	83471	83460	83460	Heidi	97	“ Is it okay if I take this ? ”
83472	83482	83483	83483	Kimber	88	“ We ’re going to be here a while , ”
83486	83490	83483	83483	Kimber	88	“ Go ahead . ”
83505	83509	83491	83491	I	0	“ Hey Heidi . ”
83510	83517	83518	83518	Heidi	97	“ Em ! Where are you ? ”
83521	83542	83518	83518	Heidi	97	“ I found the hottest guy for my New Year ’s kiss , and I want you to meet him . ”
83543	83548	83491	83491	I	0	“ I actually left . ”
83549	83561	83562	83562	Heidi	97	“ Oh , you and Jensen left early for some sex , ”
83572	83592	83568	83568	she	97	“ Actually , no . Kimber went into labor , and Jensen and I got into a huge fight . ”
83593	83599	83600	83600	Heidi	97	“ Kimber went into labor ! ”
83606	83620	83600	83600	Heidi	97	“ Should I leave ? And wait , what fight ? What happened ? ”
83621	83646	83568	83568	she	97	“ No , do n’t leave . We ’re going to be here all night . I can text you when the baby comes . ”
83647	83656	83568	83568	she	97	“ Okay . But what happened with Jensen ? ”
83657	83677	83600	83600	Heidi	97	“ His ex - wife Vanessa showed up at the party and told me that Jensen had a son . ”
83678	83688	83689	83689	Heidi	97	“ Well , of course he has a son , ”
83692	83695	83689	83689	Heidi	97	“ Duh . ”
83701	83728	83689	83689	Heidi	97	“ What do you mean of course he has a son , Heidi ! You knew ? Why would n’t you tell me something like that ? ”
83729	83794	83819	83819	she	97	“ Jesus Christ , I did n’t know that you did n’t know , Emery . Everyone knows he has a kid . He ’s like this absentee father , who spends all his money on child support and only sees his kid for the holidays . What did you think I meant when I said that he flies to New York every holiday ? ”
83835	83842	83843	83843	I	0	“ Fuck . Really everyone knows ? ”
83846	83874	83843	83843	I	0	“ I mean it ’s not a secret that he had a kid . I swear I thought you knew before you even hooked up with him . ”
83875	83880	83819	83819	she	97	“ I did n’t . ”
83881	83921	83819	83819	she	97	“ Shit , I ’m sorry . I would have said something , but I figured you knew and thought it was no big deal . It ’s not like this is his first hook up post - child . ”
83922	83925	83926	83926	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
83935	84000	83926	83926	I	0	“ It just … I do n’t think he ’s an absentee father , Heidi . I think he ’s really involved in his son ’s life . He said he ’s very protective of people meeting him . He wants me to meet him , and I do n’t know if I want that . I do n’t think he really trusts me . ”
84001	84015	84016	84016	I	0	“ Maybe he thought you already knew about his son like I did . ”
84021	84036	84016	84016	I	0	“ I do n’t think he did . We would have talked about it . ”
84037	84053	84054	84054	I	0	“ Well , now I feel even shittier . What are you going to do ? ”
84067	84073	84054	84054	I	0	“ I have no idea . ”
84074	84105	84139	84139	him	1713	“ Look , when you and Jensen started this , it was supposed to be a fling . It ’s only been a few weeks since you ’ve been together . ”
84106	84123	84124	84124	she	1712	“ Yeah . That ’s true . Why would he share crucial information with a fling ? ”
84154	84182	84183	84183	Heidi	97	“ You ’re not a fling anymore . So , if he wants you to meet his kid , then this is a good sign , Em , ”
84186	84209	84183	84183	Heidi	97	“ Just because you did n’t find out the way that you wanted does n’t mean that he does n’t trust you . ”
84210	84213	84139	84139	him	1713	“ Maybe . ”
84214	84249	84183	84183	Heidi	97	“ Okay . Worry about Kimber right now and deal with Jensen tomorrow . Maybe you ’ll have a clear head then . We can talk more if you need to work through it . ”
84250	84255	84183	84183	Heidi	97	“ Thank , Heidi . ”
84256	84262	84183	84183	Heidi	97	“ You ’re the best . ”
84263	84269	84183	84183	Heidi	97	“ Do n’t forget it . ”
84657	84662	84663	84663	Jennifer	188	“ Hey , Jensen ! ”
84666	84677	84663	84663	Jennifer	188	“ Oh , Colton has been talking about you nonstop ! ”
84678	84688	84689	84689	I	0	“ Hey Jennifer . Good to see you too . ”
84710	84713	84714	84714	Colton	185	“ Daddy ! ”
84745	84750	84751	84751	I	0	“ Hey , champ , ”
84970	84979	84980	84980	I	0	“ God , I missed you so much , ”
84998	85017	85018	85018	Colton	185	“ I missed you , too ! Are you coming home with me and Mommy and Nanny Jenn ? ”
85042	85045	85046	85046	I	0	“ Home ? ”
85086	85124	85071	85071	her	188	“ Yeah , Daddy . Mommy said that we ’re going back to New York today . I want you to come with us . You can meet my new art teacher when I start school again . ”
85184	85196	85197	85197	I	0	“ Going to have to talk to your mom about that , ”
85301	85306	85307	85307	I	0	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
85310	85322	85323	85323	She	111	“ I thought you were staying for a couple of days . ”
85326	85331	85323	85323	She	111	“ Changed my mind . ”
85332	85337	85338	85338	Colton	185	“ Hey , Daddy ! ”
85346	85353	85338	85338	Colton	185	“ Look at my new drawings . ”
85376	85383	85384	85384	he	185	“ This one is a pterodactyl , ”
85404	85410	85396	85396	he	185	“ This is a triceratops . ”
85411	85421	85422	85422	I	0	“ Wow . These are really good , champ . ”
85471	85484	85457	85457	I	0	“ Are you going to be an artist when you grow up ? ”
85485	85499	85500	85500	I	0	“ No , Daddy , I ’m going to be just like you . ”
85538	85548	85532	85532	I	0	“ You can be and do whatever you want . ”
85549	85557	85528	85528	God	85	“ I ’ll fly on planes then ! ”
85558	85563	85528	85528	God	85	“ Like a pilot ? ”
85564	85576	85577	85577	I	0	“ No . I ’ll run my business in the air . ”
85635	85665	85623	85623	I	0	“ You know , little man , I have someone very special that I want you to meet when you ’re ready . Would you like a new friend ? ”
85666	85669	85670	85670	Colton	185	“ Yeah ! ”
85673	85687	85670	85670	Colton	185	“ I love friends . Do you think he ’d color with me ? ”
85688	85691	85692	85692	Vanessa	111	“ Jensen ! ”
85733	85743	85744	85744	I	0	“ I ’m sure she would color with you , ”
85747	85764	85744	85744	I	0	“ But I ’m going to go talk to your mom for a minute , okay ? ”
85765	85770	85771	85771	I	0	“ Okay , Daddy . ”
85799	85805	85806	85806	She	111	“ We need to talk . ”
85913	85924	85870	85870	She	111	“ You are not introducing your latest fling to Colton . ”
85925	85945	85887	85887	her	111	“ She ’s my girlfriend , Vanessa . I can , and I will introduce her to my son . ”
85946	85981	85887	85887	her	111	“ Jensen , absolutely not ! You do n’t even know if she ’s going to be in your life past tomorrow ! I wo n’t allow you to disrupt his life like that . ”
85982	86025	85870	85870	She	111	“ Let ’s get to the bottom of this , Vanessa . You do n’t like that someone new is in my life , and you do n’t want it to disrupt your delusions . This has nothing to do with Colt . ”
86026	86048	86049	86049	I	0	“ I do n’t like that you ’re going to introduce him to someone that might leave . That ’s selfish . ”
86060	86101	86049	86049	I	0	“ You ’re right , Vanessa . Under any other circumstance , it would be selfish . But it has been four years since we divorced . It ’s not unreasonable for me to meet someone new in that time . ”
86107	86136	86104	86104	her	111	“ She ’s not someone new in your life . She ’s another fling . I know you have them all the time . I know the signs . ”
86137	86142	85870	85870	She	111	“ Emery is different . ”
86143	86151	86152	86152	she	111	“ Really ? How did you meet ? ”
86159	86165	86152	86152	she	111	“ At Sutton ’s wedding . ”
86166	86211	85870	85870	She	111	“ Let me get this straight . You met her a month ago , probably banged her that night , did n’t tell her about Colton , and now think you ’re ready to introduce her to him ? I do n’t think so . ”
86212	86260	85870	85870	She	111	“ What I do in my free time is none of your business . Emery is my girlfriend . You may not like that Vanessa , but that ’s not about to change . Good try showing up last night and trying to break us up though . ”
86261	86282	86283	86283	Vanessa	111	“ I was just trying to tell her the truth . You ’re the one who was a raving jackass , ”
86286	86292	86293	86293	I	0	“ The truth . Right , ”
86297	86325	86293	86293	I	0	“ You were trying to break us up . Even though you were , I am sorry that I spoke to you the way that I did . ”
86357	86382	86352	86352	I	0	“ I did n’t come here to argue with you about last night . I wanted you to understand where I ’m coming from . ”
86383	86394	86395	86395	she	111	“ Oh , I understand where you ’re coming from , ”
86398	86406	86395	86395	she	111	“ You ’re thinking with your dick . ”
86407	86450	86451	86451	I	0	“ I ca n’t handle this Vanessa . I ’m tired of arguing . I apologized for how I treated you , but you ca n’t dictate who Colton meets . Emery is in my life , and Colton is my life . ”
86492	86498	86499	86499	Vanessa	111	“ I ’ll tell Marc , ”
86514	86520	86502	86502	I	0	“ Empty threats , Vanessa . ”
86521	86528	86529	86529	she	111	“ They ’re not empty threats , ”
86532	86538	86529	86529	she	111	“ I will tell him . “
86571	86610	86563	86563	you	0	” Then I strode away from her . After kissing Colton good - bye and promising to come back later , I left the hotel and went to go see Emery . We had some catching up to do .
86889	86917	86873	86873	Noah	95	“ Hey , I saw Jensen downstairs . I think he ’s waiting for you . So , you can go ahead . I ’ll take watch . ”
87203	87207	87208	87208	I	0	“ Rough night ? ”
87222	87228	87215	87215	He	100	“ You could say that . ”
87229	87236	87237	87237	Jensen	100	“ Yeah . Me , too . ”
87262	87277	87237	87237	Jensen	100	“ Noah said that you ’re going to be here for a while longer . ”
87278	87283	87284	87284	I	0	“ Looks like it . ”
87308	87313	87303	87303	My	0	“ Thanks for these . ”
87314	87323	87324	87324	I	0	“ I thought that you might be hungry . ”
87371	87384	87385	87385	Jensen	100	“ I know I said that we did n’t have to talk , ”
87392	87402	87403	87403	I	0	“ Too much to ask for , I guess , ”
87406	87432	87403	87403	I	0	“ And we do n’t have to if it ’s too much , but I stayed up all night , thinking about what you said . ”
87433	87437	87451	87451	His	100	“ Which part ? ”
87438	87447	87448	87448	he	100	“ Me not trusting you … or anyone , ”
87475	87507	87451	87451	His	100	“ I do n’t think that I ever realized until last night that I absolutely do not trust anyone other than myself . Not one person . Not even my family . ”
87521	87542	87508	87508	I	0	“ I wish I could say that I do n’t know how that happened to me , but I do . ”
87568	87575	87576	87576	I	0	“ Colton is n’t my son . ”
87609	87615	87590	87590	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
87616	87626	87627	87627	he	100	“ I mean , Colt is Marc ’s son , ”
87644	87667	87627	87627	he	100	“ I ’ve never told anyone this . Not even my family . The only people who know are me and Vanessa . ”
87668	87673	87590	87590	I	0	“ Not even Marc ? ”
87674	87679	87680	87680	he	100	“ Especially not Marc , ”
87684	87721	87680	87680	he	100	“ I ’m a better dad than he could have ever been . I ’d spent two years with Colt . He was my son , and I could n’t lose him . Not to anyone . ”
87758	87762	87763	87763	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
87788	87875	87876	87876	He	100	“ Vanessa and I had been married for almost two years when she found out that she was pregnant . I had been living in Lubbock , taking over the company for my father after his death . I ’d barely been in New York . We were n’t even trying . I was still too devastated by his death to think about that . When she called and told me she was pregnant , I was ecstatic . Maybe I should have been more cautious . ”
87894	87900	87881	87881	he	100	“ But you were n’t . ”
87901	87939	87881	87881	he	100	“ No . I never suspected once that she and Marc were together . I was too grief - stricken and dealing with the company to consider what was going on with her when I was away . ”
87940	87959	87960	87960	I	0	“ You were dealing with all of that , and she was banging someone else on the side , ”
87965	87970	87960	87960	I	0	“ What a bitch . ”
87986	88061	87971	87971	Jensen	100	“ As I told you , I moved back to New York . As far as I know , their relationship stopped after that . I do n’t know if I believe it for sure , but I think Marc was worried Colton was his kid and cleared out . His dad was n’t doing that well , so he moved back to Austin around the same time that I got to New York . ”
88077	88082	88083	88083	I	0	“ What a creep , ”
88086	88095	88083	88083	I	0	“ So , how did you find out ? ”
88096	88147	88148	88148	I	0	“ I was there when Colton was born . I took him home from the hospital . I changed diapers . I fed him when Vanessa was sleeping . I was there every single second that I was n’t working . Colton is my son in every way that matters . ”
88168	88189	88159	88159	Jensen	100	“ Marc was in town on business for Colt ’s second birthday . We all went out to dinner together . ”
88190	88197	88148	88148	I	0	“ And you had no idea ? ”
88198	88201	88148	88148	I	0	“ None . ”
88202	88213	88214	88214	I	0	“ How could Vanessa go out to dinner with him ? ”
88217	88299	88214	88214	I	0	“ I think she thought it would be fine . I really do n’t know . The next day , I found her sitting in Colt ’s bedroom , crying . I asked her why she was crying , and she said she could n’t keep lying to me . Then , she told me about her affair with Marc . It must have been weighing on her for a long time for her to actually break down and tell me . ”
88309	88348	88300	88300	He	1778	“ We probably could have survived that . It would have taken a long time , but we could have made it . But then she told me that Colt was Marc ’s , and I lost it . ”
88349	88356	88214	88214	I	0	“ I do n’t blame you . ”
88357	88391	88392	88392	Jensen	100	“ No , I mean , I actually lost it , Emery . I rampaged throughout the apartment . I broke furniture . I found Marc and beat him to a bloody pulp . ”
88403	88433	88392	88392	Jensen	100	“ I never told him it was because of Colt though . He thought it was because of Vanessa , which is probably why he did n’t press charges . ”
88434	88445	88447	88447	I	0	“ Still … I do n’t blame you , Jensen . ”
88602	88611	88612	88612	he	100	“ So , that ’s the whole story , ”
88619	88723	88724	88724	He	1786	“ I know that you ’re upset with me , and you have every right to be , but I do trust you . Or I want to . I want you in my life , but I know that we have a ways to go . But , now , you know the whole story . I feel like our train got off the rails somewhere or took a wrong turn , but I want this to work . I would n’t be here , and I would n’t have given you my mother ’s necklace if I did n’t want that . ”
88740	88746	88724	88724	He	1786	“ This belongs to you . ”
88747	88750	88751	88751	I	0	“ Jensen , ”
88767	88786	88754	88754	He	1786	“ It ’s a promise . I ’m going to make this right . One way or another . ”
88938	88943	88944	88944	I	0	“ Who is it ? ”
88957	88960	88947	88947	I	0	“ Marc . ”
88961	88968	88969	88969	Jensen	100	“ Why would he be calling ? ”
89005	89008	88996	88996	He	1786	“ Hello ? ”
89025	89032	89016	89016	I	0	“ You son of a bitch ! ”
89033	89041	89042	89042	Marc	174	“ What do you want , Marc ? ”
89058	89067	89055	89055	Jensen	100	“ Are you out of your fucking mind ? ”
89068	89076	89077	89077	Marc	174	“ I have a right to know ! ”
89081	89095	89077	89077	Marc	174	“ It ’s been almost seven years , Marc . This is fucked . ”
89096	89131	89166	89166	his	100	“ What ’s fucked up is you lying to me for that long ! I ’m getting on a plane right the fuck now . I ’ll be in Lubbock tonight , you motherfucker . ”
89132	89143	89166	89166	his	100	“ Marc , you can not get near my son . ”
89144	89151	89152	89152	Marc	174	“ He ’s not even yours ! ”
89155	89161	89162	89162	Jensen	100	“ I am his father ! ”

89180	89228	89166	89166	his	100	“ Colton is my son , and I ’ll be damned if I let you fuck with his head by walking into his life . What you ’re going to do is irresponsible and reckless . And there ’s no way I will let you near him . ”
89229	89240	89288	89288	He	100	“ Well , you do n’t get to decide that ! ”

89348	89442	89341	89341	Vanessa	111	“ Fuck , I should have known . I went to see Colton this morning , and we argued . She threatened me by saying she would tell Marc , but she has said that a million times before . I told her it was an empty threat . Apparently , she took that to heart . I guess , she was so upset that I was going to introduce Colton to you that she decided that the best route was to inform his real father and get me out of the picture . ”
89443	89457	89498	89498	he	1788	“ You can not stand for that ! You have to do something ! ”
89458	89481	89482	89482	he	1788	“ I ’ll get my lawyers on the situation . They knew this was a possibility and we ’re prepared for it , ”
89502	89551	89487	89487	he	1788	“ I just … I have to meet with Marc tomorrow when he comes into town . Before he can see Colton , he ’ll have to get permission . My lawyers will file paperwork so that neither of us can go near Colton until this is resolved . ”
89552	89557	89558	89558	I	0	“ Oh , Jensen , ”
89567	89579	89558	89558	I	0	“ You wo n’t be able to see him at all ? ”

89616	89666	89487	89487	he	1788	“ I just … I can handle this , Emery . I can stand up to Marc again . I can face down Vanessa for the hundredth time . I can fight for Colton , like I have been doing since he was born . I need … want … ”

90005	90040	89998	89998	she	1800	“ Coming to check on y’ all and see how you ’re doing . I ’m going to need to take Bethany for a little while for some tests if that ’s all right . ”

90546	90564	90502	90502	He	100	“ Congratulations . I ’m so happy for Kimber and Noah . What did they name her ? ”
90565	90598	90599	90599	Jensen	100	“ Bethany Isla . And she ’s adorable . I ca n’t wait for you to meet her . Though Lilyanne might be worried about her boyfriend coming to see her sister . ”
90602	90618	90599	90599	Jensen	100	“ She should n’t worry . Her real competition is standing in front of me . ”

90794	90816	90817	90817	I	0	“ Sleep does n’t get anything done . There ’s too much work , too much to deal with for sleeping . ”
90913	90922	90900	90900	He	100	“ You do n’t have to do this . ”
90923	90927	90928	90928	I	0	“ Do what ? ”
90942	90946	90928	90928	I	0	“ Be here . ”
90947	90952	90996	90996	he	100	“ Do n’t I ? ”

90984	90991	90975	90975	I	0	“ So , I ’m here . ”
90992	90995	90996	90996	he	100	“ Good , ”
91013	91021	90996	90996	he	100	“ And I know what you need . ”
91022	91026	91027	91027	he	100	“ That so ? ”
91224	91234	91235	91235	I	0	“ Uh - uh . Look but no touch , ”

91437	91442	91434	91434	I	0	“ This is helping . ”
91456	91462	91450	91450	I	0	“ You need to sleep . ”
91463	91477	91478	91478	he	100	“ You think I ’m going to sleep after seeing you in lingerie ? ”
91552	91582	91538	91538	I	0	“ You need to sleep . You ’re a walking zombie . I came over to help you . I do n’t think marathon sex is going to help . ”
91583	91591	91592	91592	he	100	“ It ’s not going to hurt , ”
91645	91648	91649	91649	I	0	“ Jensen , ”

91920	91923	91910	91910	he	100	“ Seriously ? ”
91924	91942	91943	91943	I	0	“ I said I wanted to taste you . This is how I want to taste you . ”
92262	92273	92256	92256	He	100	“ This is the best sleep I ’ve ever gotten . ”
92292	92297	92281	92281	I	0	“ Me , too . ”
92473	92478	92466	92466	Marc	174	“ Vanessa told me . ”
92859	92865	92866	92866	Emery	190	“ You ’re up early , ”
92877	92894	92866	92866	Emery	190	“ Six hours of sleep is plenty for me . You can go back to sleep . ”
92895	92898	92899	92899	she	190	“ Mmm , ”
92911	92927	92899	92899	she	190	“ If you keep that up , you ’re never going to leave that bed . ”
92949	92963	92942	92942	she	190	“ I should probably check on Kimber . When do you meet Marc ? ”
92964	92974	92975	92975	I	0	“ This afternoon . He had to fly commercial , ”
92992	92998	92999	92999	she	190	“ Oh , the horror , ”
93002	93020	92999	92999	she	190	“ So , I can pick you up from the hospital later if that works for you . ”
93021	93035	93036	93036	I	0	“ Yes , as long as you think you ’ll be all right . ”
93039	93079	93036	93036	I	0	“ I have some work to do and a meeting with my lawyer before that . I ’ll be occupied . Plus , you helped me last night . I can face another day with you at my side . ”
93086	93093	93080	93080	She	190	“ Good . I ’m glad . ”
93209	93217	93218	93218	she	190	“ I ’ve been thinking about you , ”
93224	93231	93232	93232	I	0	“ How are Kimber and Bethany ? ”
93246	93261	93232	93232	I	0	“ They ’re great . All of them are . Ready to go home . ”
93262	93266	93218	93218	she	190	“ I bet . ”
93267	93289	93232	93232	I	0	“ They ’re getting discharged within the hour . So , they get to take the little cutie home with them . ”
93290	93298	93299	93299	I	0	“ I remember what that ’s like , ”
93355	93362	93348	93348	Emery	190	“ We ’ll work it out . ”
93363	93371	93372	93372	I	0	“ You ’re right . We will , ”
93567	93575	93576	93576	she	111	“ You ’ve got to be joking , ”
93579	93586	93576	93576	she	111	“ She ca n’t be here . ”
93710	93715	93716	93716	Marc	174	“ You fucking douche , ”
93719	93747	93716	93716	Marc	174	“ You spent all this time taking everything away from me , and now , you took more than six years away from me and my son . ”
93748	93753	93754	93754	I	0	“ We ’ll see , ”
93774	93784	93769	93769	Emery	190	“ I ’m here to take my son back . ”
93785	93790	93791	93791	I	0	“ You can try , ”
93854	93862	93863	93863	We	1874	“ You can all come in now . ”
93885	93895	93896	93896	Vanessa	111	“ Does she have to be here for this ? ”
93899	93906	93896	93896	Vanessa	111	“ She ’s not even involved ! ”
93907	93911	93912	93912	I	0	“ She stays , ”
93917	93924	93925	93925	Jake	194	“ She ’s fine by me , ”
93933	93965	93925	93925	Jake	194	“ Considering my client has made it clear that he wants Miss Robinson in his life and eventually in Colton ’s life , I think her presence makes sense for this . ”
93966	93970	93971	93971	Vanessa	111	“ Never happening , ”
93974	93979	93980	93980	I	0	“ We ’ll see , ”
93984	94100	93980	93980	I	0	“ After going over everything in the last twenty - four hours , I got a judge to approve my request that no new people could be introduced into Colton ’s life until we have this all sorted out . That includes you , Miss Robinson , and Mr. Tarman . Unfortunately , due to the nature of the concern over who is the father to Colton Wright , I ’ve also asked my client , Mr. Wright , not to have contact with Colton until we have this all resolved . All of this is , of course , temporary , barring no complications in the proceedings . Is that all understood and acceptable ? ”
94148	94178	94179	94179	he	174	“ Additionally , I ’ve requested a paternity test be taken immediately to determine who is Colton ’s biological father . That test should be administered at this location , ”
94193	94200	94179	94179	he	174	“ within forty - eight hours . ”
94201	94212	94213	94213	Marc	174	“ My client disagrees that a paternity test is necessary , ”
94218	94249	94213	94213	Marc	174	“ He was the only one sleeping with Ms. Hendricks at the time in which Colton was conceived . There is no doubt in his mind that Colton is his . ”
94250	94268	94269	94269	Jake	194	“ If there is no doubt , then he wo n’t have any problem with the test , ”
94273	94292	94269	94269	Jake	194	“ And , furthermore , if he is so certain , why is he just now coming forward ? ”
94311	94363	94364	94364	Vanessa	111	“ When Ms. Hendricks told my client she was pregnant , she said the child belonged to Mr. Wright , and she was going to stop seeing my client . He chose to believe her , but it appears that she has been lying to both of them this whole time . ”
94387	94473	94384	94384	I	0	“ Regardless of Ms. Hendricks ’s actions or comments during or after the pregnancy , a paternity test is mandatory to determine the custody situation for Colton . Our first priority is his continued health , especially his mental health . The last thing we want to do is introduce new people to him without first being sure that what we are doing is legal . If your client wishes to have any contact with Colton , then he must submit to a paternity test . ”
94474	94480	94481	94481	Marc	174	“ I ’ll do it , ”
94490	94515	94516	94516	Marc	174	“ Good . Then , we will reconvene after the results have come in , and then we can determine what will happen next . ”
94536	94544	94545	94545	I	0	“ That went as well as expected , ”
94556	94575	94549	94549	He	194	“ The test takes a few days , Jensen . Do n’t do anything foolish in the meantime . ”
94576	94579	94580	94580	I	0	“ Foolish ? ”
94583	94589	94580	94580	I	0	“ Like kidnapping your son . ”
94666	94671	94658	94658	I	0	“ I wo n’t . ”
94672	94739	94740	94740	Jake	194	“ Good . I might recommend that you take some time off . Just get away for a few days . I can handle the heavy lifting from here , and you should try to take your mind off of this until we get the results in . If you stay here , I suspect you ’ll do something else foolish … like assault Marc Tarman , ”
94747	94750	94740	94740	Jake	194	“ Again . ”
94751	94765	94766	94766	I	0	“ I think , this time , he would n’t be so generous , ”
94782	94789	94790	94790	Jake	194	“ No , he would n’t , ”
94813	94821	94822	94822	she	190	“ I ’ll take care of him , ”
94839	94849	94850	94850	I	0	“ There ’s one thing I do n’t understand , ”
94861	94865	94850	94850	I	0	“ Just one ? ”
94869	94882	94850	94850	I	0	“ Well , probably a lot of things but one in particular . ”
94883	94888	94833	94833	her	190	“ What ’s that ? ”
94889	94901	94938	94938	He	1889	“ Why did n’t you ever get a paternity test done ? ”
94902	94924	94850	94850	I	0	“ You mean … if I thought that Colton was Marc ’s all along , why did n’t I confirm it ? ”
94925	94928	94833	94833	her	190	“ Yes . ”
94954	95039	94938	94938	He	1889	“ For a couple reasons . Proof could have only hurt me . Proof could have taken him away . Proof could have shattered our reality . If I got a paternity test , and it said , as I suspect it will in a couple days , that Colton is Marc ’s son , then I could lose him . But if I never got one done , then Vanessa only had the threat to hang over my head , and nothing else . “
95068	95069	95056	95056	you	1889	” “
95121	95133	95117	95117	I	0	” My eyes widened , and a smile stretched my face . “
95172	95210	95162	95162	he	185	” A tear glimmered in my eye , and I wrapped my arms around his waist , drawing him into a hug . He held me tight and placed a kiss on the top of my head . “
95220	95221	95217	95218	Jensen Wright	100	” “
95232	95241	95225	95225	I	0	” I released Jensen and wiped my eyes . “
95257	95265	95246	95246	them	1895	” He warily stared down at me . “
95292	95494	95246	95246	them	1895	” He moved past me and took the driver ’s seat in the Mercedes . It took me a couple of seconds to get composed . I could n’t imagine what he was feeling or how he was handling this right now . My heart went out to him , and I truly feared that , if all went as I suspected it would , with Marc ’s test coming back as Colton ’s father , that Marc and Vanessa would wreck him . With a gulp , I followed Jensen into the car . We drove across town to the lab specified on the form . I told Jensen I would wait in the lobby while he got his test done . It took forever . I was n’t sure why since all he had to do was a normal cotton swab or a blood test . But that was a doctor ’s office for you . I flipped through my phone and read a few magazines while I waited . By the time he finally came out , I had a full plan of action for the few days we ’d have to wait until the tests came back . “
95497	95504	95246	95246	them	1895	” I asked as we exited . “
95513	95514	95515	95515	I	0	” “

95602	95606	95607	95607	We	1898	” he asked . “
95616	95625	95613	95613	I	0	” He sighed , knowing I was right . “

95646	95647	95648	95648	I	0	” “
95653	95723	95648	95648	I	0	” Jensen drove us to Kimber ’s place in a hurry . He took corners so fast , I thought we were going to go flying . But I did n’t tell him to stop or slow down . I knew what had kindled this aggression . Heidi ’s car was in the driveway when we showed up . And she greeted us at the door with baby Bethany . “
95728	95738	95726	95726	cutie	1902	” I said , accepting her like a present . “
95745	95752	95726	95726	cutie	1902	” Heidi said with a grin . “
95757	95758	95759	95759	Heidi	97	” “
95761	95858	95759	95759	Heidi	97	” he said with a smile . She gave me a strange look , as if she could n’t figure out what was up with us . How could I blame her ? I was sure she was wondering what the hell was happening with us . Last she had heard , we ’d gotten in a fight on New Year ’s Eve , and now , he was showing up to see the baby . There was a lot I needed to explain , and there was no time like the present to do it . “
95864	95871	95859	95859	She	1904	” I said with a grin . “
95876	95883	95884	95884	Noah	95	” Kimber said from the couch . “

95900	95925	95890	95890	Lily	90	” I confirmed . I turned my attention to Jensen , who was looking down at Bethany like she was the most exquisite thing . “
95933	95934	95927	95927	you	1906	” “
95941	95942	95927	95927	you	1906	” “
95946	95950	95927	95927	you	1906	” Kimber said . “
95957	96008	95951	95951	You	1906	” He nodded , and then I passed him the little bundle of joy . He immediately softened . I knew he was thinking about Colton at this age . He could n’t see his son right now , but it must have felt nice to hold a baby regardless . “
96016	96017	96009	96009	I	0	” “
96020	96024	96009	96009	I	0	” Kimber asked . “
96052	96053	96046	96046	Jensen	100	” “
96060	96064	96058	96058	Em	190	” Kimber said , “
96076	96077	96069	96069	I	0	” “
96103	96122	96097	96097	I	0	” Heidi followed me upstairs and leaned against the doorframe as I stuffed clothes into my overnight bag . “
96139	96140	96160	96160	You	190	” “
96149	96157	96143	96143	I	0	” I told her with a grin . “
96169	96170	96173	96173	you	190	” “
96180	96181	96176	96176	I	0	” “
96208	96212	96219	96219	He	100	” I shrugged . “
96239	96240	96229	96229	I	0	” “
96252	96253	96254	96254	I	0	” “
96258	96266	96254	96254	I	0	” I told her , facing her . “
96321	96328	96312	96312	I	0	” Heidi held her hands up . “
96359	96360	96346	96346	I	0	” “
96371	96372	96346	96346	I	0	” “

96437	96438	96439	96439	You	0	” “
96451	96455	96456	96456	I	0	” Heidi snorted . “
96467	96468	96464	96464	you	190	” “
96498	96499	96495	96496	my niece	842	” “
96504	96570	96495	96496	my niece	842	” I finished filling up my bag , slung it over my shoulder , and then retreated downstairs . I hugged Kimber , who was cooing over Bethany asleep in Jensen ’s arms . It was almost comical really . He was such a big guy , and she was so tiny . Yet he held her as if she were the most precious cargo . “
96577	96585	96571	96571	She	842	” Jensen said before passing her back . “
96591	96592	96571	96571	She	842	” “
96596	96606	96594	96594	you	0	” she said , smiling down at her daughter . “
96624	96630	96620	96620	you	0	” I said to Kimber . “
96633	96642	96620	96620	you	0	” Kimber said , giving me a hug . “
96646	96656	96657	96657	You	0	” Jensen and I retreated back to his Mercedes . “
96669	96679	96657	96657	You	0	” I grinned as we drove to his place . “
96685	96686	96657	96657	You	0	” “
96691	96692	96657	96657	You	0	” “
96699	96717	96657	96657	You	0	” He smiled the first real smile all afternoon , and his eyes raked over my body . “
96721	96721	96657	96657	You	0	”
96888	96895	96896	96896	Jensen	100	“ Maybe we should go back , ”
96900	96909	96910	96910	I	0	“ Look , I know you ’re worried , ”
96929	96973	96910	96910	I	0	“ I ’m worried , too . But you need to get your mind off of things just until we know the test results . If not , all you ’ll do is worry yourself to death … and probably do something stupid . ”
96988	96994	96983	96983	His	100	“ You ’re probably right . ”
96995	97001	97002	97002	His	100	“ I ’m definitely right . ”
97009	97024	97002	97002	His	100	“ And how exactly are you going to get my mind off of things ? ”
97025	97032	96983	96983	His	100	“ I had a few ideas . ”
97033	97048	97049	97049	I	0	“ Does the first start with you stripping in front of the fire again ? ”
97052	97060	97049	97049	I	0	“ That ’s like the third idea . ”
97068	97077	97080	97080	he	100	“ We should move it up the list . ”
97122	97127	97128	97128	he	100	“ Help me forget , ”
97360	97365	97366	97366	I	0	“ I love you , ”
97390	97397	97398	97398	He	100	“ I will always love you . ”
97636	97642	97643	97643	Jensen	100	“ How are you doing ? ”
97650	97655	97643	97643	Jensen	100	“ Never been better . ”
97656	97659	97660	97660	he	100	“ Mmm , ”
97663	97671	97672	97672	I	0	“ I think I want to teach , ”
97679	97689	97672	97672	I	0	“ I bet you ’d be amazing at it . ”
97690	97715	97643	97643	Jensen	100	“ My mother , of all people , suggested I do it , and now , I think it sounds like the right choice . ”
97716	97724	97643	97643	Jensen	100	“ Is that what you want then ? ”
97725	97773	97672	97672	I	0	“ It was the only thing that really made me happy in grad school . I thought it would get easier . All the research and papers and such , but it was the classroom that made me happy . I just … thought that was normal . ”
97774	97782	97783	97783	he	100	“ Maybe it was telling you something , ”
97794	97799	97800	97800	I	0	“ Maybe it was , ”
97803	97837	97800	97800	I	0	“ I ’ve never really told anyone that . It was anathema to what everyone thought I should be focusing on in grad school . No one talked about loving the teaching side . ”
97838	97855	97856	97856	I	0	“ Well , I think you should stop caring what they think and follow your heart . ”
97878	97884	97872	97873	Jensen Wright	100	“ I think I have . ”
97885	97891	97892	97892	he	100	“ You are my heart , ”
97909	97990	97895	97895	He	100	“ And I ca n’t thank you enough for being here right now through all of this . I know that things have n’t been easy . You could have left at anytime . Yet you are here with me through the hardest moment of my life . No matter what happens , Emery , when I walk out on the other side of this … I want you to be with me . I want you to be mine . ”
98002	98006	97991	97991	I	0	“ I am . ”
98148	98153	98154	98154	Jake	194	“ Tests are in , ”
98157	98160	98154	98154	Jake	194	“ Showtime . ”
98161	98169	98116	98116	Emery	143	“ Do you know what they say ? ”
98170	98191	98192	98192	I	0	“ They ’re sealed . We ’ll find out at the same time as everyone else . But be prepared . ”
98201	98206	98192	98192	I	0	“ Time to go . ”
98230	98234	98224	98224	I	0	“ Right now ? ”
98235	98241	98215	98215	Her	1936	“ Test results are in . ”
98242	98245	98246	98246	she	1936	“ Fuck , ”
98252	98257	98246	98246	she	1936	“ Let ’s go . ”
98258	98287	98288	98288	She	1936	“ We have to get everyone together at once before we can go through the sealed paperwork . But we should get over there as soon as possible . ”
98601	98604	98605	98605	Vanessa	111	“ What ? ”
98608	98611	98612	98612	I	0	“ Nothing , ”
98620	98627	98612	98612	I	0	“ Just had an amusing thought . ”
98628	98644	98645	98645	I	0	“ Your thought was so clear on your face . Maybe turn off the broadcast . ”
98777	98789	98790	98790	Jake	194	“ Thank you for joining us again on such short notice , ”
98797	98825	98790	98790	Jake	194	“ We just received the paperwork from the laboratory that did the paternity test . This is the first time any of us will be seeing it . “
98909	98915	99013	99014	the father	1959	” Everyone but Emery said , “
98918	98982	99013	99014	the father	1959	” around the table , anxiously staring at the paperwork . He bent back the metal brackets holding the envelope secured and then opened it . A stack of papers came out , and on the top , were the results . I held my breath as Jake read through the document . You could have heard a pin drop in the room . “
98994	99008	98991	98992	Mr. Wright	125	” Jake turned to face me with a giant smile on his face . “
99021	99292	99293	99293	I	0	” Vanessa exclaimed from across the room , and I heard Marc cuss . But it was all background noise to me . It was like being sealed in a vacuum . Colton was my son . He was mine . My boy . I nearly broke down at the very thought that , after all this time , all this worrying , all the arguments and debates and complications … Colton had been mine all along . I ’d been so sure that Vanessa was telling the truth . She had been so sure of the truth . I had let her hang it over my head for years . Years ! But she was wrong . Or she had lied . She had lied to my face all those times . Told me countless times that I had n’t even been in New York the month that she got pregnant . My schedule had n’t always overlapped with hers , but I ’d believed her . She ’d had no reason to say otherwise . Colton had been two years old before I even knew about it . By then , the exact travel dates had been lost on me . I could see them on my work schedule and the flight schedules , but we had n’t always had sex every time I was there . It had been impossible to determine if I was Colt ’s father . Now , I knew that I was . Colton was mine . Emery ’s arms were around me , and I stood , lifting her into the air . “
99300	99307	99293	99293	I	0	” she whispered through the vacuum . “
99314	99390	99312	99312	you	0	” I murmured back , forgetting everyone else in the room . I set her back down on her feet , cupped her face in my hands , and kissed the breath out of her . This was the moment I had been born for . The knowledge that I had the woman I loved here with me now and that I would never have to worry about my son again . It was euphoric . “
99397	99408	99395	99395	Vanessa	111	” Marc cried , jarring me out of my moment . “
99417	99443	99411	99411	you	111	” Marc ’s and Vanessa ’s lawyers were looking at the document , but it was clear from their faces that they agreed with Jake . “
99456	99460	99449	99449	you	0	” Vanessa said . “
99479	99480	99475	99475	You	0	” “
99489	99490	99481	99481	You	0	” “
99498	99508	99509	99509	I	0	” she whispered . Tears brimmed in her eyes . “
99512	99513	99509	99509	I	0	” “
99523	99533	99534	99534	You	0	” I said , drawing her attention to me . “
99575	99658	99573	99573	you	0	” At those words , Vanessa completely lost it . She broke down into tears and covered her face in her hands . Vanessa had been holding onto this fact for so long , thinking it was a way to keep me . As if she had thought for a second that I would still hold a flame for her after all she had done . But it was over . There was nothing left . And she had no more control . “
99684	99688	99675	99676	Mr. Tarman	127	” Jake said . “
99708	99732	99705	99706	Ms. Hendricks	195	” Vanessa shook her head , blubbering about how she ’d sworn she knew . She ’d thought this would fix it all . “
99738	99853	99854	99854	I	0	” I said to Jake . Sure , I would love to get custody of Colton and have him live here in Lubbock with me . But I did n’t want to go to court with Vanessa over it , and I was n’t willing to disrupt Colt ’s life . He was happy in New York , and he had a great school there . I was n’t the type of person to do something like that just to make someone else miserable . That was all Vanessa . We filed out of the office and stood in the foyer . Vanessa was shaking , talking to her lawyer . Marc approached us . “
99871	99872	99875	99875	you	0	” “
99879	99883	99875	99875	you	0	” I said . “
99911	99931	99933	99933	he	1971	” Marc glared and looked ready to throw a punch . Instead , he turned to Emery and grinned . “
99944	99952	99933	99933	he	1971	” Emery arched an eyebrow in disgust . “
99959	99963	99933	99933	he	1971	” He laughed . “
99979	99980	99975	99975	He	1971	” “
100005	100009	100000	100000	I	0	” I growled . “
100012	100013	100000	100000	I	0	” “
100025	100029	100023	100023	Jensen	143	” Emery said . “
100049	100069	100070	100070	I	0	” I turned to face my girl and smiled . She was right . Of course she was right . “
100078	100079	100075	100076	my son	1669	” “
100087	100200	100201	100201	Jensen	143	” I took Emery ’s hand then and left the lawyer ’s office . I knew there was more to take care of , and I definitely had to get back to the office . But first things first . I needed to set all of this straight . Vanessa might be upset about it . Frankly , I did n’t care for Vanessa ’s opinions any longer . Emery was in my life , and she was here to stay . We showed up at the hotel right after our meeting , and I took Emery up to the top floor . I knocked on the door and Nanny Jennifer answer . “
100211	100215	100203	100203	I	0	” she said . “
100230	100231	100218	100218	Vanessa	111	” “
100250	100251	100241	100242	the judge	1975	” “
100258	100264	100241	100242	the judge	1975	” Jennifer smiled at Emery . “
100271	100272	100269	100269	Emery	143	” “
100280	100289	100278	100278	you	143	” Emery said , holding out her hand . “
100300	100306	100295	100295	Colt	186	” I turned to Emery . “
100323	100324	100315	100315	I	0	” “
100328	100332	100315	100315	I	0	” she agreed . “
100340	100356	100357	100357	Daddy	140	” Nanny Jennifer called . I walked into the suite just as Colton came running . “
100359	100394	100357	100357	Daddy	140	” He launched himself into my arms , and I hugged him tighter than I ’d ever squeezed him before . My son . Mine ! No one could ever take him away again . “
100399	100409	100397	100397	champ	3038	” I said . I set him back down . “
100426	100427	100412	100412	I	0	” “
100433	100440	100443	100444	A girl	897	” Colton singsonged . I laughed . “
100457	100458	100455	100455	Emery	143	” “
100464	100465	100459	100459	You	3038	” “
100487	100526	100484	100484	you	3038	” Colton looked down at himself and gave me a thumbs up . God , I loved him . I took his hand , and we walked together to the front of the suite where Emery was waiting . “
100539	100576	100577	100577	Emery	143	” I said to Colton . Colton stood very still and smiled up at Emery with the brilliance that only a child could have . Then , I looked up in Emery ’s big green eyes . “
100584	100585	100577	100577	Emery	143	” “
100591	100602	100586	100586	You	143	” he said with a Wright grin . Emery laughed . “
100624	100625	100616	100616	I	0	” “
100638	100639	100626	100626	Dad	104	” “
100647	100648	100626	100626	Dad	104	” “
100659	100674	100650	100650	you	0	” Emery smiled and looked up at me with a question in her eyes . “
100677	100683	100650	100650	you	0	” I answered for her . “
100709	100710	100711	100711	I	0	” “
100716	100727	100711	100711	I	0	” Emery said as much to me as to Colton . “
100740	100814	100728	100728	I	0	” We moved back into the living space and took a seat . I picked Colton up and planted him on my knee . Emery sat next to me , and I wrapped my other arm around her . This was our life . It was n’t perfect . It was far from easy . But it was ours . And I loved them both more than words for being a part of it .
100820	100830	100831	100831	I	0	“ Heidi , have you seen my black pumps ? ”
100838	100842	100831	100831	I	0	“ Which ones ? ”
100843	100852	100853	100853	She	1993	“ The closed - toe ones . Roundish . ”
100900	100904	100892	100892	she	1993	“ Gimme those . ”
100933	100939	100947	100947	she	1993	“ How do I look ? ”
100940	100946	100947	100947	she	1993	“ I ’d fuck you , ”
100953	100971	100947	100947	she	1993	“ Oh God , I hope all the high school boys are n’t going to think that . ”
100972	100981	100947	100947	she	1993	“ Um … hell yes , they are . ”
101043	101048	101049	101049	he	143	“ Hey , babe , ”
101057	101068	101049	101049	he	143	“ Are you really wearing that on your first day ? ”
101069	101078	101079	101079	I	0	“ Why ? Do I look like shit ? ”
101084	101107	101108	101108	I	0	“ No , you look hot as fuck . Every kid in the place is going to want to bang their teacher . ”
101111	101120	101108	101108	I	0	“ Ew . Should I go for flats ? ”
101121	101133	101134	101134	He	143	“ Only if you change into the heels for me later . ”
101267	101278	101279	101279	Jensen	143	“ Come on , before you ’re late to class , ”
101292	101299	101300	101300	I	0	“ See you later , Heidi ! ”
101303	101314	101315	101315	she	2001	“ Have a good first day at school , darling ! ”
101539	101546	101547	101547	I	0	“ Thanks for dropping me off , ”
101622	101629	101630	101630	he	2016	“ Have a good first day , ”
