9301	9309	9310	9310	He	103	“ You ’re replying to one now . ”
9335	9378	9379	9379	She	111	“ I kept the e - mail short and sweet , Eli . You can finish it in ten minutes even with that blunt - fingered , caveman - style , hunt - and - peck typing method you seem to favor . ”

9441	9477	9437	9437	she	111	“ And feeding you is now part of my job . Not literally , of course . I trust you can maneuver a fork to your mouth if you can move around on a prosthesis . ”
9532	9539	9540	9540	he	586	“ I do n’t like Isa , ”
9543	9551	9540	9540	he	586	“ Well , then call me Isabella . ”
9552	9561	9603	9603	Eli	103	“ What if I do n’t like Isabella ? ”
9562	9594	9603	9603	Eli	103	“ Then you are welcome to call me Ms. Sawyer , but it ’s rather formal , do n’t you think ? I ’d feel enticed to call you Mr. Crane . ”
9595	9602	9603	9603	Eli	103	“ Mr. Crane is my father . ”
9634	9658	9659	9659	His	103	“ Then I suggest you find a suitable name to call me so I do n’t accidentally age you thirty - five years . ”
9742	9745	9746	9746	she	590	“ Sable , ”
9760	9764	9746	9746	she	590	“ Say again ? ”

9791	9806	9787	9787	she	590	“ You can call me Sable if you do n’t prefer Isa or Isabella . ”
9814	9817	9818	9818	he	103	“ Sable , ”
9873	9878	9879	9879	She	590	“ There you go . ”
9907	9923	9899	9899	she	590	“ I ’ll order for you , then . No preferences on what you eat ? ”
9924	9932	9933	9933	he	103	“ No meat unless it ’s seafood , ”
9936	9942	9933	9933	he	103	“ You ’re a vegetarian ? ”
9981	9985	9962	9962	Eli	103	“ Sort of . ”
9986	9999	10000	10000	She	590	“ Very well . I ’ll let you know when it arrives . ”
10092	10094	10072	10072	he	103	“ Sable ”
10467	10472	10473	10473	He	103	“ Stupid fucking chair . ”

10732	10741	10742	10742	Her	111	“ Do you eat a lot of takeout ? ”
10755	10776	10777	10777	She	111	“ I do . Too much . Probably I should cook more , but I ’m so busy at work . ”
10792	10799	10785	10785	she	111	“ Lots of people need assistants . ”
10856	10863	10864	10864	he	103	“ You do this a lot ? ”
10884	10888	10872	10872	He	103	“ Do what ? ”
10935	10938	10920	10920	He	103	“ Assist . ”
10939	10945	10946	10946	She	111	“ Oh , of course . ”
10974	10992	10993	10993	she	111	“ This is my job , after all . I ’m well versed in how to serve , ”
11020	11037	11038	11038	He	103	“ Well , this can be your last day . I do n’t need your help . ”
11075	11094	11095	11095	She	111	“ I should have warned you , I had them make both our entrees the same heat level . ”
11113	11145	11152	11152	he	103	“ Today is n’t my last day , Eli , but if you ’d like , I can finish up after lunch . I have another assignment that needs my attention . ”
11200	11214	11215	11215	he	103	“ What ’s it going to take to get you out of here ? ”
11308	11326	11327	11327	She	111	“ Start by telling me what had you cursing and grunting earlier . Did you hurt yourself ? ”
11332	11335	11336	11336	he	103	“ No , ”
11344	11359	11339	11339	Her	111	“ You do n’t have to tell me . I ’m not your nurse . ”
11360	11368	11329	11329	her	111	“ You did n’t answer my question . ”
11369	11378	11339	11339	Her	111	“ You do n’t answer any of mine . ”
11379	11384	11385	11385	Her	111	“ Dammit , Sable . ”
11427	11431	11417	11417	She	111	“ Forget it . ”
11548	11598	11511	11511	his	103	” Isa told Chloe . She plunked her tote onto her desk , where her assistant sat tapping out an e - mail . After completing her third day at Eli ’s beck and call , Isa realized she was n’t at his beck and call . He did n’t “
11600	11602	11511	11511	his	103	” or “
11604	11752	11511	11511	his	103	” her to do anything . She ’d been the one pushing and prodding him . This assignment was certainly different than any in her past experience . Eli was n’t piling to - dos on top of to - dos onto her shoulders — quite the opposite . She spent most of her day trying to keep busy and e - mailing Reese to ask what to do next . That stopped tomorrow . She understood the gist of what Reese wanted and refused to keep bugging the busy CEO for details . The man had plenty to do that had nothing to do with his stubborn mule of a brother . Though , she admired the way he behaved as if Eli were part of his job . Worrying over him like a mother bird fretting while her baby attempted to leap from the nest . “
11757	11780	11511	11511	his	103	” Chloe tapped the keyboard with flair and waggled her hands in front of her like she ’d performed a magic trick . “
11790	11791	11787	11788	Cranky Crane	142	” “
11796	11809	11787	11788	Cranky Crane	142	” Isa smiled at her friend ’s nickname for their latest client . “
11819	11829	11830	11830	I	0	” Chloe rolled the chair away from the desk . “
11883	11894	11861	11870	clients who have n’t paid in sixty days or more	619	news”—she stood and pulled a manila file folder from Isa ’s inbox—“is
11918	11919	11909	11909	You	616	” “
11923	11947	11909	11909	You	616	” Isa stuffed the folder into her tote . One reason why Chloe was her right - hand woman was her insane efficiency . “
11960	11967	11909	11909	You	616	” She lifted an eyebrow sardonically . “
11975	11976	11909	11909	You	616	” “
11979	12007	11909	11909	You	616	” Chloe knew the story since she ’d been Isa ’s in - office PA for over two years . Isa leaned on her more than anyone . “
12010	12015	12016	12016	I	0	” Isa told her , “
12031	12119	12024	12024	I	0	” Together they shut off lights and computers , set the alarm , and walked to the private parking lot . Isa did n’t bother going to her upstairs apartment to change . Dinner with her parents was going to be a formal , dry affair , and what she was wearing — a slim skirt paired with a blouse — would do nicely . Or so she ’d thought . When she arrived at Flaire fifteen minutes late for dinner , she wished she ’d changed . “
12121	12272	12341	12341	You	623	” did n’t describe the place . It was oppressive , the sweltering atmosphere drowning diners in an air of money and pompous righteousness . She thought of Eli , this time with a measure of relief . His environment was nothing like this one despite his money — in fact , she would n’t have guessed his monetary status if she had n’t known his background . At least working for billionaire Elijah Crane did n’t involve a massive mansion with a house full of staff buzzing about . She could handle grouchiness , but the privileged elite , not so much . She spotted her parents the moment she bypassed the host stand , her mother ’s red dress and her father ’s height standing out . Helena Sawyer ’s long hair was pulled into a proper chignon , black with a few gray threads she insisted gave her “
12275	12301	12302	12302	Mom	143	” Her father , Hugh , had lighter hair than her mother ’s and turned an affable smile to Isa the instant he spotted her . “
12306	12310	12304	12304	Dad	623	” Isa sat . “
12317	12322	12311	12311	You	623	” Her mother frowned . “
12328	12329	12311	12311	You	623	” “
12350	12351	12343	12343	we	624	” “
12365	12563	12343	12343	we	624	” Isa ordered a glass of white wine from the waitress and lifted the menu to review the a la carte selections . Her parents followed suit and reviewed their own menus , chatting off to the side about which entrees to share and which to skip . Isa was glad they were occupied by something other than what she did for a living . It was an exhausted topic , one she definitely did n’t want to broach after a long , long week , half of which was spent in the company of Eli ’s bad attitude . There she went thinking about him again . She guessed that was n’t atypical considering she often took her work home with her . She had n’t been a personal assistant since she ’d hired enough staff to stop . It was n’t all that strange that she ’d be caught up in her thoughts , turning over the last days she ’d spent with him . Or it could be electricity snapping in the air whenever you ’re in his presence . Hmm . They ordered and Isa lifted her wineglass and took a hearty swig . “
12576	12577	12578	12578	We	626	” “
12591	12602	12589	12589	Isabella	110	” her mother said , lids lowered , brows raised . “
12617	12635	12610	12610	I	0	” Isa finished her wine and tapped the rim of the glass when the waitress walked by . “
12645	12650	12589	12589	Isabella	110	” her mother asked . “
12667	12668	12669	12669	We	626	” “
12679	12721	12669	12669	We	626	” her father said . News of her ex ’s promotion settled in Isa ’s stomach like a rock . The waitress ’s timing on that second glass was impeccable . Isa accepted the wine and drank down a hearty gulp . “
12733	12759	12669	12669	We	626	” Isa opened her mouth to say no , or more aptly hell , no , but her father anticipated the answer and spoke first . “
12777	12778	12771	12771	you	630	” “
12789	12793	12771	12771	you	630	” she asked . “
12803	12812	12801	12801	Josh	144	” her father said . Isa replied drily . “
12822	12869	12870	12870	He	144	” Everything he ’d ever dated her for . She ’d always wondered if , when she broke things off with him , he was saddened because their relationship was ending or because he might not be able to secure a higher station at Sawyer Financial . “
12887	12942	12879	12879	You	632	” Her mother moved her hands to her lap as the waitress brought a round of tapas . No , and Isa did n’t fault him for his drive . She faulted him for not loving her in a whole and genuine way . He appreciated her breeding more than her as a person . “
12952	12956	12879	12879	You	632	” Helena continued , “
12981	13004	13005	13005	Our	634	” Isa closed her eyes and counted to five . That was the farthest she made it before her father started in . “
13036	13037	13043	13043	Dad	131	” “
13045	13088	13043	13043	Dad	131	” Isa said , measuring her words carefully . This was n’t a new conversation . One day , they ’d hear her . For now , she would let them think she was having a repeat of her teenage drama years . “
13105	13114	13099	13099	he	144	” Her mother let out a disbelieving pfft . “
13135	13136	13099	13099	he	144	” “
13141	13146	13137	13137	He	144	” her mother said . “
13152	13167	13168	13168	I	0	” Okay , so this angle was new . Isa felt her forehead crease . “
13178	13179	13168	13168	I	0	” “
13193	13228	13189	13189	He	144	” Her mother cut a scallop in half casually as if she was n’t trying to steer Isa into the arms of a man who barely liked her , who ’d never loved her . “
13235	13265	13229	13229	He	144	” Isa said . How could he ? He ’d barely tolerated her and her big ideas to start a business outside of Sawyer Financial when they were dating . “
13273	13284	13271	13271	Isabella	110	” Her father lifted his martini to illustrate his point . “
13294	13295	13289	13290	another man	560	” “
13309	13361	13306	13306	women	638	” Isa mumbled . She was n’t jealous , but it was frustrating to know that he ’d carried out the plan he ’d warned her about . If you do n’t climb to the top of Sawyer Financial mountain with me , Bella , I can find someone who will . “
13372	13377	13362	13362	You	0	” her mother interjected . “
13382	13388	13362	13362	You	0	” Isa lifted her wine . “
13417	13471	13472	13472	Renegades	642	” Isa put down her glass without taking a sip . Her father was referring to Reese ’s reputation with women before he ’d married Merina . Twice . Rumor had it he ’d nearly missed out on being named CEO because of his philandering ways , but who knew what to believe ? “
13477	13482	13474	13475	those Cranes	643	” Her mother sneered . “
13491	13522	13523	13523	We	645	” Isa asked , because seriously , how random was it that they ’d brought up the Crane family the very week she ’d stepped in as Eli ’s assistant ? “
13528	13543	13523	13523	We	645	” her mother said , chin aloft . The gossip rags , she meant . “
13566	13611	13523	13523	We	645	” Her mother chewed a tiny bite of scallop and carved another . Yes , wealthy people were to be well behaved , quiet , and pave paths only with the gold of their ancestors . Heaven forbid one of them start a rebellion . “
13651	13652	13653	13653	Isabella	110	” “
13655	13664	13653	13653	Isabella	110	” Her father ’s fair skin went pink . “
13725	13756	13757	13757	We	649	” His words never failed to cut her to the quick . Several defenses sprang to mind , all well worn . Frankly , Isa was too tired to participate . “
13763	13815	13757	13757	We	649	” Her father ’s temper cooled and he laid a hand over hers on the table . She knew he wanted the best for her . At their core , both her parents did . But she refused to bend to their will if it meant sacrificing her dreams for theirs . “
13821	13865	13866	13866	Dad	131	” She snatched her hand away . She was not a princess , refused to be a princess . She wanted to rule the kingdom , but she ’d do so following her own rules , not those set by the elitist few . “
13904	13907	13894	13894	I	0	one”—since Melanie ’s exit—“employees
13920	13962	13911	13911	I	0	” Isa used to try to make her parents proud but soon found it impossible . Now she ’d settle for quiet . If they ’d stop harassing her about her lowly choice of vocation , she ’d be eternally grateful . “
13965	13975	13911	13911	I	0	” Isa said , slicing into her own scallop , “
13988	14003	13984	13984	I	0	” She hated to lie , but they had n’t left her much choice . “
14009	14010	14007	14007	someone	605	” “
14014	14019	14007	14007	someone	605	” her father asked . “
14025	14036	14022	14022	you	0	” Her mother ’s brow rose to its highest point . “
14043	14059	14022	14022	you	0	” Like as of ten seconds ago . Isa redirected her eyes to her plate . “
14068	14159	14022	14022	you	0	” Especially since it was n’t true . Isa had been single and just fine , thank you , since she and Josh had split . She ’d had a dinner date here and there before then , but over the last eighteen months , she ’d quit dating altogether . Her focus had been on building Sable Concierge to the next level . And now that she was so , so close to that goal , her parents wanted her to start dating Josh ? No friggin ’ way . “
14178	14187	14188	14188	Your	0	” her father said , adding an unfriendly , “
14198	14199	14188	14188	Your	0	” “
14208	14212	14188	14188	Your	0	” Isa snapped . “
14215	14238	14188	14188	Your	0	” her parents answered at the same time . Damn . Had they put his dating status into his contract or something ? “
14247	14255	14256	14256	I	0	” her mother added with a smile , “
14270	14271	14259	14259	Josh	144	” “
14277	14415	14275	14275	Helena	138	” her father said with a proud smile . A perfect example of why talking with her parents was akin to talking to a wall . They had an agenda , and they ’d see it through . The option of not showing up was tempting , but she also knew there would be many Chicago elite at that party . It was n’t a bad idea to rub elbows with them . But the matchmaker thing was not happening . To be sure , she ’d hatch a plan of her own , Isa thought smugly as she sat back so the waitress could take her plate and replace it with a salad . Isa would find a fake date for that night to be her arm candy while she worked the room . Win - win .
14762	14767	14768	14768	Isa	111	“ Chloe , hey . ”
14794	14802	14792	14792	Eli	103	“ Sorry , hon . No luck . ”
14803	14809	14847	14847	Chloe	112	“ Did you try Tracy ? ”
14810	14820	14847	14847	Chloe	112	“ Yeah , he ’s getting married that day . ”
14821	14826	14792	14792	Eli	103	“ Oh . Wow . ”
14827	14846	14847	14847	Chloe	112	“ I know . Unlucky , right ? I heard back from the other guys on your list . ”
14880	14887	14874	14874	Isa	111	“ And the rest of them ? ”
14888	14892	14896	14896	Chloe	112	“ All nos . ”
14908	14926	14896	14896	Chloe	112	“ Brandon is out of town for work , and Nathan said his wife would kill him . ”
14927	14936	14896	14896	Chloe	112	“ My gosh , Nathan is married too ? ”
14937	14944	14874	14874	Isa	111	“ Uh - huh . And Travis and”—more
14946	14971	14896	14896	Chloe	112	flipping—“Jacob and Antonio … No , wait , Antonio is n’t married . He ’s gay and his partner ’s birthday is that weekend . ”
14972	14975	14976	14976	Isa	111	“ Stop . ”
14983	14992	14976	14976	Isa	111	“ I ’ll have to make a plan B. ”
14993	14997	14998	14998	Chloe	112	“ Escort service ? ”
15013	15023	15004	15004	She	111	“ What do you need a date for anyway ? ”
15054	15067	15042	15042	She	111	“ My parents are trying to get Josh and me back together . ”
15074	15077	15042	15042	She	111	“ Why ? ”
15078	15082	15083	15083	She	111	“ The usual . ”
15088	15101	15083	15083	She	111	“ Breeding of the strong bloods , world takeover , yada yada . ”
15111	15142	15108	15108	she	111	“ I told them I was dating someone . I did n’t think it ’d be this hard to find a stand - in by the time of the banquet . ”
15157	15160	15108	15108	she	111	“ Crap . ”
15161	15164	15108	15108	she	111	“ Yeah . ”
15165	15171	15172	15172	Chloe	112	“ What about my brother ? ”
15175	15185	15172	15172	Chloe	112	“ He ’s twenty - three but very mature . ”
15186	15190	15108	15108	she	111	“ Absolutely not . ”
15191	15196	15108	15108	she	111	“ He looks older . ”
15197	15222	15172	15172	Chloe	112	“ The idea was to be discreet and keep everything professional . Plus , does n’t your brother live in Maryland with your family ? ”
15223	15227	15108	15108	she	111	“ Good point . ”
15228	15233	15234	15234	Isa	111	“ Thanks for trying . ”
15252	15262	15234	15234	Isa	111	“ I ’ll work it out on my end . ”
15263	15282	15108	15108	she	111	“ You sound formal . Are you pretending to work in case you ’re overheard by Beast Crane ? ”
15283	15288	15108	15108	she	111	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
15289	15306	15307	15307	Isa	111	“ Would you settle for a pretend girlfriend ? I look great in a cocktail dress . ”
15322	15340	15313	15313	she	111	“ I ’ll consider it . There would be the added bonus of stealing Josh ’s thunder . ”
15341	15344	15349	15349	Eli	103	“ Sable ! ”
15353	15361	15362	15362	Chloe	112	“ He does not call you that . ”
15365	15369	15362	15362	Chloe	112	“ He does . ”
15370	15384	15385	15385	She	111	“ It ’s kind of sexy , though . Do n’t you think ? ”
15411	15421	15422	15422	Isa	111	“ Do n’t be ridiculous . Got ta go . ”
15510	15513	15519	15519	her	111	“ Sable ! ”
15575	15580	15581	15581	She	111	“ Yes , Eli . ”
15650	15656	15657	15657	he	103	“ Your shoes are irritating , ”
15663	15666	15667	15667	She	111	“ These ? ”
15712	15723	15691	15691	He	103	“ Yes . Wear something quieter . Those are disruptive . ”
15747	15753	15754	15754	she	111	“ What , like Crocs ? ”
15764	15777	15757	15757	He	103	“ Apologies , Eli , but I ’m not changing my shoes . ”
15796	15804	15778	15778	She	111	“ Fine . Then you ’re fired . ”
15805	15813	15814	15814	She	111	“ Oh , no , not again . ”
15835	15838	15825	15825	She	111	“ Refill ? ”
15901	15904	15905	15905	he	103	“ No , ”
15914	15917	15908	15908	She	111	“ Wait . ”
15931	15934	15918	15918	She	111	“ Yeeees ? ”
15935	15938	15928	15928	her	111	“ Sit . ”
15939	15948	15949	15949	He	103	“ I ’m not a dog , Eli . ”
15963	15974	15949	15949	He	103	“ Ms. Sawyer , wo n’t you have a seat ? ”
15975	15981	15982	15982	she	111	“ I ’d love to , ”
15999	16010	15982	15982	she	111	“ I heard you on the phone . Personal call ? ”
16011	16028	16031	16031	her	111	“ I do n’t think that ’s your business seeing as how you just fired me . ”
16118	16136	16111	16111	she	111	“ You ’re looking for a date on my time , Sable . That is my business . ”
16182	16192	16178	16178	she	111	“ I … It ’s not what you think . ”
16200	16220	16221	16221	She	111	“ I ’m attending a function requiring a plus - one , that ’s all . You know what ? ”
16228	16235	16221	16221	She	111	“ It wo n’t happen again . ”
16236	16239	16240	16240	He	103	“ Good . ”
16286	16316	16275	16275	Isa	111	“ If we ’re done here , I ’m calling it a day . You ’ll be glad to know my disruptive shoes and I can see ourselves out . ”
16317	16321	16322	16322	She	111	“ Very funny . ”
16400	16403	16404	16404	he	103	“ Stubborn , ”
16442	16445	16446	16446	Eli	103	“ Zach , ”
16485	16495	16496	16496	Zach	156	“ I ’m outside . Ca n’t get in . ”
16528	16540	16518	16518	her	110	“ Hang on . I ’ll be down in a second . ”
16551	16568	16547	16547	Zach	156	“ Wait . We ’re good . Some woman in a white car just … damn . ”
16610	16615	16616	16616	Zach	156	“ Thanks , love , ”
16632	16637	16626	16626	he	156	“ Day - um . ”
16691	16696	16697	16697	Eli	103	“ Come on up , ”
16745	16750	16751	16751	Zach	156	“ Who was that ? ”
16758	16766	16767	16767	Eli	103	“ My assistant . She ’s taken , ”
16780	16786	16767	16767	Eli	103	“ Mercy . I guess . ”

17038	17045	17028	17028	Eli	103	“ Yeah , thanks . Beer ? ”
17046	17049	17052	17052	They	699	“ Sure . ”
17067	17071	17061	17061	Eli	103	“ Nickel tour ? ”
17072	17076	17077	17077	Zach	156	“ Hit me , ”
17102	17144	17099	17099	he	156	“ Home gym equipped with rehabilitation equipment . You may have noticed I do n’t have to worry about widening the doorways since I ’m not in a wheelchair , but if I did , I only have a few . The bedroom”—he
17151	17178	17179	17179	Zach	156	hallway—“office and bathrooms . Other than that , I have no problem getting around in here . Some soldiers are n’t as fortunate as I am . ”
17212	17228	17229	17229	Eli	103	“ Like the two men who died from the grenade that blew my leg off , ”
17299	17343	17296	17296	he	103	“ Injured men and women come home from the military to apartments and homes with narrow hallways , doorways , countertops that are too tall , and various other obstacles that make it difficult to feel like you ’ll ever return to normal . ”
17349	17352	17296	17296	he	103	“ normal , ”
17491	17508	17474	17474	Zach	156	“ Do n’t get a lot of use out of that area , I ’m guessing ? ”
17509	17512	17513	17513	Eli	103	“ No . ”
17772	17780	17781	17781	Zach	156	“ What do you need from me ? ”
17834	17888	17889	17889	Zach	156	“ I ’d like to provide a service for our soldiers who come home with less than they had when they left . You ’re a good contractor . You know good people . And if you give me a decent rate , we can help a lot of men and women acclimate . ”
17893	17905	17906	17906	Eli	103	“ What ’s in it for you is the free advertising , ”
17931	17967	17915	17915	Eli	103	“ I ’ll mention your company on the website , on the flyers , and at every event held to raise money . Ferguson Builders will be synonymous with reliable work and a golden heart . ”
17968	17972	17973	17973	Zach	156	“ Golden heart . ”
18004	18016	17978	17978	he	156	“ I know a few girls who would argue that sentiment . ”
18017	18025	18026	18026	Zach	156	“ Then leave them off your references . ”
18029	18040	18026	18026	Zach	156	“ All right . I ’ll work up an estimate . ”
18041	18056	17978	17978	he	156	“ You can think about it . I do n’t need an answer immediately . ”
18057	18070	18071	18071	Zach	156	“ Nah . I do better when I go with my gut . ”
18074	18091	18071	18071	Zach	156	“ You have more to show me , or was this all the pitch you had ? ”
18092	18097	18098	18098	Eli	103	“ I have more . ”
18509	18513	18514	18514	she	111	“ Good morning , ”
18543	18553	18522	18522	she	111	“ I , um , did n’t expect you to be”—mostly
18560	18569	18570	18570	She	111	distracting—“out here . Slow day in the office ? ”
18893	18911	18912	18912	he	103	“ I guess you think it ’s indecent of me to expose you to my workout routine , ”
18915	18925	18912	18912	he	103	“ If I were you , I ’d quit . ”
18964	18976	18977	18977	he	103	“ Getting a shower while you ’re here . Also indecent , ”
19150	19153	19134	19134	His	103	“ sign up ”
19362	19366	19367	19367	he	103	“ Fuck it , ”
19837	19843	19826	19827	His dad	760	“ like your old man . ”
20013	20016	20017	20017	He	103	“ Whatever . ”
20133	20142	20143	20143	he	103	“ No more of this shit , Eli , ”
20161	20171	20172	20172	He	103	“ You ’re a lucky son of a bitch . ”
20378	20390	20370	20370	She	111	“ If you can unkink yourself , I have your lunch . ”
20530	20541	20542	20542	She	111	“ When is the last time you stood and stretched ? ”
20613	20624	20599	20599	he	103	“ When was the last time you stood and stretched ? ”
20625	20632	20599	20599	he	103	“ I stretch once an hour . ”
20640	20662	20599	20599	he	103	“ I move around a lot , as you noticed the other day when you lodged a complaint about my heels . ”
20746	20752	20753	20753	she	111	“ You trimmed your beard , ”
20869	20872	20859	20859	he	103	“ Sable . ”
20886	20889	20890	20890	She	111	“ Yes ? ”
20955	20963	20964	20964	he	103	“ Did you order lunch for yourself ? ”
20968	20971	20972	20972	she	111	“ No , ”
20982	20990	20972	20972	she	111	“ I was going to go out . ”
20991	20994	20995	20995	he	103	“ Fine , ”
21059	21073	21045	21045	he	103	“ Take off the rest of the day while you ’re at it . ”
21087	21090	21091	21091	She	111	“ Fine . ”
21119	21128	21129	21129	Isa	111	“ That ’s not the worst of it ! ”
21165	21175	21176	21176	Chloe	112	“ I ’ve been fired at least five times . ”
21183	21195	21176	21176	Chloe	112	“ I think you secretly love that he ’s a challenge . ”
21196	21202	21203	21203	Isa	111	“ At first , yes . ”
21209	21241	21203	21203	Isa	111	“ Now it ’s less about the challenge and more of a concern . Will I be able to replace myself with another assistant ? Who would put up with him ? ”
21275	21283	21284	21284	Chloe	112	“ I do n’t know , Isa . ”
21292	21331	21288	21288	her	112	“ If he ’s not going to cooperate , maybe you should give up on the Cranes altogether . They may have wealthy contacts in Chicago , but they ’re not the only rich people who live here . ”
21401	21406	21407	21407	Isa	111	“ You ’re right , ”
21414	21437	21410	21410	her	111	“ I can overcome adversity . I ca n’t let myself believe that Elijah Crane could single - handedly tank my reputation . ”

21775	21781	21768	21768	he	453	“ Yet here we are . ”
21782	21787	21788	21788	Chloe	112	“ Here we are , ”
21791	21799	21788	21788	Chloe	112	“ Do you know the Cranes well ? ”
21823	21837	21800	21800	Isa	111	“ I have done some work for them in the past , yeah . ”
21873	21879	21880	21880	she	112	“ Thanks for saying hello , ”
21888	21905	21880	21880	she	112	“ I assume if you ’ll be working with Eli I ’ll see more of you ? ”
21906	21912	21913	21913	His	453	“ I ’d like that . ”
21937	21962	21927	21927	Isa	111	“ Too bad you ’re taken , doll . Not to be overly forward but I ’d have asked you out today if not . ”
21963	21966	21967	21967	Chloe	112	“ Taken ? ”
21977	21996	21970	21970	Zach	156	“ Uh , dating ? Betrothed ? We d ? Not sure what y’ all say up here . ”

22100	22124	22097	22097	he	453	“ He and I are just getting started on the project , so I ’m sure he ’ll loop you in soon enough . ”
22166	22175	22176	22176	she	111	“ Yes , I ’m sure he will , ”
22183	22192	22176	22176	she	111	“ Nice to meet you , Isabella Sawyer . ”
22218	22222	22223	22223	Chloe	112	“ Urban cowboy , ”
22234	22252	22223	22223	Chloe	112	“ Good Lord , the testosterone … I’m not used to that much packed into one person . ”
22320	22330	22331	22331	Chloe	112	“ What did Eli mean by you being taken ? ”
22351	22365	22366	22366	Isa	111	“ I do n’t know . But I ’m going to find out . ”
22382	22391	22366	22366	Isa	111	“ Use the company credit card for lunch . ”
22392	22407	22408	22408	Chloe	112	“ Wait ! Do n’t leave me here ! What if he comes back ? ”

22698	22737	22686	22686	Eli	103	“ I ran into him at Elsa ’s just now . Or , rather , he ran into me . He let me know he would have asked me out if I wasn’t — and I quote—‘taken . ’ ”
22738	22747	22748	22748	Eli	103	“ He should n’t be asking you out . ”
22760	22767	22768	22768	She	111	“ That ’s not my problem . ”
22774	22786	22768	22768	She	111	“ My problem is that someone told him I was taken . ”
22814	22829	22830	22830	Eli	103	“ You ’re not to date Crane employees while you ’re working for me , ”
22833	22847	22830	22830	Eli	103	“ I ’m not aware of any Crane business Mr. Ferguson is doing . ”
22858	22866	22848	22848	She	111	“ The answer is no , Sable . ”
22867	22885	22911	22911	his	103	“ You do n’t have any right to tell me who I can and ca n’t date . ”

23156	23160	23146	23146	she	111	“ Why what ? ”

24390	24402	24403	24403	She	111	“ By handicap , I assume you mean your horrible attitude . ”
24410	24426	24403	24403	She	111	“ And do n’t do that teeth - sucking thing just because you ’re pissed . ”

24432	24446	24447	24447	His	103	“ It ’s your tic when you do n’t know what to say . ”
24477	24497	24465	24465	He	103	“ You do n’t want me to date Zach because you want me for yourself . Is that it ? ”
24522	24527	24528	24528	She	111	“ Yeah , right . ”
24718	24730	24731	24731	He	103	“ I overstepped a boundary . It wo n’t happen again . ”

35664	35685	35655	35655	He	103	“ I thought it ’d be simpler if you thought I was an employee who would n’t stop showing up . ”
35686	35696	35740	35742	the last assistant	1082	“ You mean you thought I ’d underestimate you . ”
35700	35706	35740	35742	the last assistant	1082	“ Happens all the time . ”
35774	35780	35750	35750	He	103	“ Who lives up there ? ”
35781	35785	35750	35750	He	103	“ I do . ”
35792	35797	35750	35750	He	103	“ There ’s more . ”
35801	35804	35806	35806	his	103	“ Ha ! ”
35826	35830	35831	35831	he	103	“ What more ? ”
35856	35859	35860	35860	She	111	“ Tonight . ”
35879	35887	35860	35860	She	111	“ It ’s my parents ’ function . ”
35888	35895	35896	35896	He	103	“ Not your ex - employer ? ”
35901	35904	35896	35896	He	103	“ Actually … ”
35921	35932	35907	35907	her	111	“ Both . The event is for Sawyer Financial Group . ”
35993	36001	36002	36002	she	111	“ It ’s not a long story , ”
36005	36017	36002	36002	she	111	“ I ’ll tell you while we drive to the Vancouver . ”
36045	36052	36053	36053	he	103	“ You can tell me now , ”
36076	36102	36103	36103	She	111	“ My ex - boyfriend is going to be at this function . Because he ’s the one who is accepting the position of president . ”
36136	36148	36149	36149	she	111	“ I was groomed for running Sawyer Financial my entire life , ”
36152	36173	36174	36174	she	111	“ My parents introduced me to Josh . We were to be the power couple that someday ran the company , ”
36182	36199	36174	36174	she	111	“ My parents knew I did n’t want the future they ’d laid out for me . ”
36200	36207	36221	36221	her	111	“ Sounds like an arranged marriage . ”
36208	36213	36214	36214	she	111	“ Felt like one , ”
36224	36256	36214	36214	she	111	“ But without the marriage part . Josh planned on taking the position of president , and he said I could be VP or run staffing . Whatever made me happy . ”
36257	36263	36264	36264	Eli	103	“ How generous of him , ”
36319	36355	36312	36312	his	103	“ He ’s the son my parents never had . It broke their hearts when we split . They blamed my stubbornness and my obsession with going into business for myself for driving him away . ”
36356	36368	36369	36369	He	103	“ They wanted you to fulfill their dreams , not yours . ”
36425	36486	36418	36418	she	111	“ My parents would n’t care that Josh dated me only to climb the ladder . They care about appearances as much as he does . Whenever the topic of my running a firm for assistants comes up , I can see the embarrassment on their faces . I may as well have gone into trash collection or cleaning hotels . ”
36487	36492	36493	36493	Eli	103	“ Both honorable positions , ”
36532	36543	36523	36523	Isa	111	“ I’m … I did n’t mean it like that . ”
36544	36548	36549	36549	He	103	“ I know . ”
36626	36638	36612	36612	He	103	“ No other secrets about your vocation or parentage , then ? ”
36639	36648	36649	36649	She	111	“ No , I think that ’s it . ”
36653	36657	36649	36649	She	111	“ All right . ”
36723	36749	36715	36715	He	103	“ So this Josh ? You want me there because of him ? Or were you serious about men , plural , hitting on you ? ”
36750	36763	36715	36715	He	103	“ Ugh . That probably made me sound completely full of myself . ”
36764	36772	36773	36773	He	103	“ Not completely . Only a little . ”
36798	36823	36787	36787	her	111	“ My mother believes if she can get Josh and me into the same room , we ’ll fall into each other ’s arms . ”
36824	36832	36833	36833	He	103	“ Because proximity is equal to attraction . ”
36865	36868	36869	36869	Isa	111	“ Sometimes , ”
36907	36917	36897	36897	He	103	“ Stay put . I ’ll get your door . ”
36961	36970	36971	36971	he	103	“ I see your point about the stubbornness , ”
36980	36987	36971	36971	he	103	“ Takes one to know one . ”
37029	37032	37033	37033	His	103	“ Fuck . ”
37053	37056	37046	37046	her	111	“ Wait . ”
37108	37116	37117	37117	She	111	“ Can we use the side entrance ? ”
37142	37153	37154	37154	She	111	“ These shoes and stairs do n’t go well together . ”
37240	37243	37244	37244	she	111	“ Please ? ”
37346	37350	37351	37351	Eli	103	“ Invitation only , ”
37354	37364	37365	37365	He	103	“ Trust me . I ’m on the list . ”
37402	37413	37414	37414	she	111	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re getting cold feet , ”
37417	37424	37414	37414	she	111	“ I need you in there . ”
37625	37634	37635	37635	Eli	103	“ I ’m guessing that ’s your mother , ”
37638	37644	37635	37635	Eli	103	“ Green dress , right ? ”
37645	37656	37666	37666	his	103	“ Good eye . Helena Sawyer in the ageless flesh . ”
37657	37663	37664	37664	He	103	“ You look like her . ”
37676	37685	37664	37664	He	103	“ I ’ll take that as a compliment . ”
37686	37690	37666	37666	his	103	“ You should . ”
37691	37703	37704	37704	she	111	“ My height is from my father ’s side , though , ”
37861	37875	37876	37876	Eli	103	“ Were you assigned to sit next to someone you do n’t like ? ”
37884	37893	37876	37876	Eli	103	“ Well , that ’s a long list . ”
37912	37928	37900	37900	he	103	“ I was hoping for a table in the back so I could slip out . ”
37929	37948	37949	37949	Eli	103	“ That ’s why you brought me , Sable . You do n’t have to run or hide . ”
38026	38029	38020	38021	her mother	390	“ Isabella ? ”
38069	38071	38068	38072	the “ renegade ” Cranes	147	“ renegade ”
38074	38085	38086	38086	Her	111	“ Are you going to introduce me to your date ? ”
38103	38113	38086	38086	Her	111	“ Of course . Helena Sawyer , Eli Crane . ”
38127	38132	38120	38120	her	390	“ Oh , really . ”
38152	38164	38143	38143	Helena	138	“ I was n’t aware Isa knew the Cranes … intimately . ”
38187	38195	38196	38196	Isa	111	“ We are acquainted professionally as well , ”
38205	38209	38165	38165	Her	138	“ Josh will be disappointed”—her
38216	38228	38229	38229	She	138	Eli—“if you do n’t congratulate him personally before we get started . ”
38241	38251	38229	38229	She	138	“ If you ’ll excuse us for a moment . ”
38252	38262	38263	38263	Eli	103	“ No , I do n’t think I will , ”
38271	38282	38266	38266	Helena	138	“ We came together , did n’t we , Sable ? ”
38334	38338	38339	38339	Isa	111	“ Thank you , ”
38354	38366	38367	38367	he	103	“ You do n’t have to play nice , you know , ”
38373	38385	38367	38367	he	103	“ I do if I hope to blend with this crowd . ”
38403	38413	38367	38367	he	103	“ I was hoping to make a good impression . ”
38414	38443	38455	38455	she	111	“ We will . But it does n’t mean you have to adhere to the rules they set before you left . And you did leave , Sable . ”
38461	38473	38455	38455	she	111	“ In fact , let ’s have a cocktail before introductions . ”
38482	38487	38474	38474	Eli	103	“ He can wait . ”
38488	38492	38493	38493	she	111	“ He can , ”
38529	38532	38526	38526	he	103	“ Helena . ”
38541	38550	38538	38538	he	103	“ We ’ll join you in a few . ”
38615	38628	38629	38629	Eli	103	“ You need to brief me before I talk to this guy . ”
38672	38696	38697	38697	she	111	“ All you have to do is say ‘ Nice to meet you ’ and then we ’ll go back to our table , ”
38700	38705	38697	38697	she	111	“ No briefing necessary . ”
38706	38722	38723	38723	He	103	“ I promise you , I will not say ‘ Nice to meet you . ’ ”
38736	38744	38723	38723	He	103	“ How long did you date him ? ”
38745	38750	38754	38754	he	103	“ What ? Why ? ”
38763	38767	38768	38768	he	103	“ Champagne okay ? ”
38771	38775	38768	38768	he	103	“ I guess . ”
38793	38798	38786	38786	He	103	“ Wine ? Beer ? ”
38803	38815	38799	38799	Her	111	“ I ’d love a beer but that ’s really inapprop — ”
38816	38821	38822	38822	he	103	“ Two Stella Artois , ”
38833	38837	38838	38839	the bartender	1162	“ Frosted glass ? ”
38842	38845	38838	38839	the bartender	1162	“ Bottles . ”
38869	38887	38850	38850	he	103	“ You do n’t strike me as the type to conform in a crowd , Isabella Sawyer . ”
38888	38896	38897	38897	She	111	“ Being here … around my parents . ”
38902	38915	38899	38899	her	111	“ I feel like a child around them — a misbehaving one . ”
38916	38934	38850	38850	he	103	“ So if I were n’t here , you ’d choke down champagne you do n’t want ? ”
38935	38943	38944	38944	Her	111	“ My mother says ladies drink champagne . ”
39059	39083	39040	39040	He	103	“ Trust me , Sable . No one will mistake you for anything less than a lady . Even holding a beer bottle . ”
39100	39112	39091	39093	a few men	1165	“ I think you ’re more of a catch with it . ”
39126	39129	39130	39130	he	103	“ Now , ”
39133	39139	39130	39130	he	103	“ Let ’s hear it . ”
39140	39144	39130	39130	he	103	“ Hear what ? ”
39145	39156	39157	39157	He	103	“ Whatever I need to know about this Josh guy . ”
39188	39196	39185	39185	her	111	“ What do you need to know ? ”
39197	39204	39220	39220	He	103	“ Did you live with him ? ”
39205	39208	39209	39209	She	111	“ No . ”
39215	39219	39209	39209	She	111	“ Thank God . ”
39265	39270	39271	39271	he	103	“ Were you engaged ? ”
39274	39278	39271	39271	he	103	“ Definitely not . ”
39279	39287	39309	39309	his	103	“ How long did you date him ? ”
39288	39295	39296	39296	she	111	“ Are you writing a book ? ”
39299	39305	39306	39306	he	103	“ Journal entry , maybe , ”
39313	39316	39306	39306	he	103	“ Sorry . ”
39327	39336	39317	39317	She	111	“ I ’m beginning to regret coming here . ”
39337	39342	39343	39343	She	111	“ Why did you ? ”
39356	39367	39345	39345	her	111	“ I do n’t like going into enemy territory blind , ”
39393	39402	39384	39384	her	111	“ I ’ve got your six , Sable . ”
39479	39491	39492	39492	she	111	“ Josh and I dated on and off for five years , ”
39495	39503	39492	39492	she	111	“ We split around three years ago . ”
39504	39508	39509	39509	He	103	“ Five years . ”
39545	39553	39554	39554	She	111	“ And you want me here because … ”
39570	39610	39554	39554	She	111	“ Because I want both Josh and my parents to know I ’m not going to date him again . He once delivered an ultimatum that I choose his dream or my own or we could n’t be together . ”
39611	39616	39554	39554	She	111	“ So you left . ”
39630	39637	39554	39554	She	111	“ Actions speak louder than words . ”
39638	39650	39651	39651	Eli	103	“ So you ’re saying you ’re looking for some action . ”
39686	39695	39675	39675	she	111	“ That ’s not what I ’m saying . ”
39696	39704	39705	39705	She	111	“ Well that ’s what I heard . ”
39821	39826	39827	39827	Eli	103	“ Okay , Sable , ”
39842	39855	39827	39827	Eli	103	“ Let ’s you and I go see this ex of yours . ”
39886	39888	39867	39867	Eli	103	“ six ”
40094	40105	40088	40088	He	144	“ Josh , look who ’s come to congratulate you . ”
40118	40123	40124	40124	Josh	144	“ Hi , Bella , ”
40130	40137	40124	40124	Josh	144	“ Nice to see you again . ”
40151	40158	40143	40143	her	111	“ Accompanying her is Elijah Crane . ”
40181	40185	40186	40186	Josh	144	“ Mr. Crane , ”
40189	40213	40186	40186	Josh	144	“ I read a piece in the Trib about you when you came home . Honorably discharged . Thank you for your service . ”
40280	40287	40288	40288	Helena	138	“ If you ’ll excuse me , ”
40291	40302	40288	40288	Helena	138	“ I have to go say hello to the Kitchers . ”
40322	40328	40306	40306	she	138	“ Bella , you look … ”
40337	40341	40306	40306	she	138	“ Very pink . ”
40342	40352	40353	40353	Eli	103	“ Gorgeous is the word you ’re looking for , ”
40369	40382	40362	40362	Josh	144	“ Seemed an inappropriate observation to make since you two are together . ”
40415	40427	40428	40428	she	138	“ There was never a chance we ’d get back together , ”
40443	40458	40432	40432	Josh	144	“ Still enamored with serving others , are you ? Do you serve him ? ”
40459	40465	40466	40466	Eli	103	“ We ’re done here . ”
40498	40522	40492	40492	she	138	“ We ’ve both known for years we did n’t want the same things , Josh . Why would you want me back ? ”
40523	40553	40492	40492	she	138	“ Your parents want you back , Bella . You left them high and dry . Their only child not taking over the business when they needed you most . ”
40559	40571	40556	40556	he	103	“ I understand what the two of you have in common . ”
40592	40605	40606	40606	Josh	144	“ You have two seconds to get the fuck away from us . ”
40623	40645	40618	40618	he	144	“ We ’re in public , Crane . I ’d hate to see you make the paper for an unbecoming reaction . ”
40646	40649	40650	40650	Fists	182	“ One . ”
40698	40702	40703	40703	Josh	144	“ Very well . ”
40725	40730	40731	40731	Josh	144	“ Enjoy the party . ”
40746	40753	40754	40754	she	111	“ He ’s good at that , ”
40758	40776	40754	40754	she	111	“ Saying the right words to ignite your temper , then walking away cool as a cucumber . ”
40777	40786	40787	40787	Eli	103	“ What did you see in that asshole ? ”
40797	40824	40787	40787	Eli	103	“ I wish I could remember . I was a different person when he and I dated . He ’d rage and I ’d step down . ”
40825	40833	40839	40839	he	103	“ What kind of rage , Isa ? ”
40861	40871	40847	40847	He	103	“ Did he ever … Did he hit you ? ”
40872	40877	40878	40878	She	111	“ Eli . No . ”
40900	40923	40895	40895	He	144	“ Nothing like that . He delivered an ultimatum when he was n’t successful at getting my compliance . That ’s it . ”
40924	40929	40930	40930	Eli	103	“ That ’s enough . ”
40951	40955	40939	40939	his	103	“ This scar ? ”
40956	40968	40969	40969	She	111	“ I fell out of a tree when I was eight . ”
41001	41013	41014	41014	he	103	“ You do n’t want to be here , do you ? ”
41028	41041	41019	41019	her	111	“ The only good part about being here is being with you . ”
41097	41108	41085	41085	he	103	“ Then let ’s get the hell out of here . ”
41254	41263	41264	41264	he	103	“ I cut the buttons off your shirt , ”
41278	41286	41264	41264	he	103	“ Uh . Yes . I remember . ”
41287	41296	41264	41264	he	103	“ You were n’t scared of me then ? ”
41297	41302	41303	41303	she	111	“ Of course not , ”
41344	41351	41352	41352	he	103	“ Because I ’m so cuddly ? ”
41397	41420	41421	41421	She	111	“ When I was with Josh , I was different . I did n’t know what I wanted . Now I do … ”
41441	41472	41431	41431	she	111	“ Josh never loved me for me . He loved the idea of our partnership . Like my parents , he was enamored with the dollhouse style of our coupling . ”
41529	41543	41544	41544	he	103	“ It ’s hard to be with someone who does n’t know you , ”
41588	41603	41582	41582	she	111	“ Do your parents know the real story behind why you and Josh split ? ”
41604	41627	41577	41577	Eli	103	“ No . They think I went rogue and dumped him along with Sawyer Financial . They thought it was a phase . ”
41628	41643	41644	41644	He	103	“ Oh , right . The start - your - own - business phase . ”
41717	41752	41710	41710	he	103	“ My family and Josh ’s family go way back . The Lindens have been friends with the Sawyers for generations . My parents fear ill will and a bad reputation over all else . ”
41753	41769	41770	41770	He	103	“ So you show up to your ex - boyfriend ’s ceremony with Eli Crane ? ”
41777	41792	41770	41770	He	103	“ You were a last resort , so you ca n’t possibly feel used . ”
41793	41800	41801	41801	he	103	“ Thanks . That ’s touching , ”
41818	41826	41809	41809	Her	1204	“ I … That came out wrong . ”
41827	41832	41833	41833	he	103	“ It ’s okay , ”
41895	41924	41891	41891	she	1204	“ To Josh , I was a yellow - brick road leading to the wizard . Have n’t you had someone date you because of who you were ? ”
41937	41959	41925	41925	He	103	“ I guess that makes sense . You ’re not exactly using your family ’s name to advance , are you ? ”
41960	41965	41966	41966	he	103	“ Neither are you , ”
41970	41997	41966	41966	he	103	“ Sable Concierge is n’t tied to them in name , and I assume you did n’t borrow a hefty loan from them to start it . ”
41998	42008	42012	42012	her	1205	“ Not from them . Not from Sawyer Financial . ”
42058	42062	42063	42063	He	103	“ Isabella Sawyer . ”
42089	42092	42063	42063	He	103	“ Yes ? ”
42093	42101	42125	42125	her	111	“ Would you join me for dinner ? ”
42102	42120	42125	42125	her	111	“ At this time on a Saturday night ? We ’ll wait two hours for a table . ”
42144	42158	42159	42159	he	103	“ You underestimate my reach . Do n’t you know who I am ? ”
42180	42186	42187	42187	he	103	“ This is Eli Crane , ”
42193	42200	42187	42187	he	103	“ I have a standing reservation . ”
42353	42361	42362	42363	the host	1216	“ Chianti as per your standing reservation , ”
42445	42450	42451	42451	She	111	“ Color me impressed . ”
42466	42483	42460	42460	she	111	“ How ’d you get us in here ? Does the owner owe you a favor ? ”
42484	42494	42495	42495	Eli	103	“ The owner ’s son was my rehabilitation guy , ”
42502	42557	42495	42495	Eli	103	“ Ex - military . We spent a lot of time together while I was learning to walk on the leg and he mentioned Benicia ’s over and over . Said once I get out and about to stop by and he ’d have a table and a bottle of Chianti waiting for me . ”
42558	42561	42578	42578	Eli	103	“ Wow . ”
42562	42571	42578	42578	Eli	103	“ He ’s a man of his word . ”
42572	42577	42578	42578	Eli	103	“ As are you . ”
42649	42666	42667	42667	she	111	“ You have a knack for making friends in spite of your trying hard not to , ”
42689	42694	42695	42695	he	103	“ Are we friends ? ”
42722	42727	42728	42728	He	103	“ I think so . ”
42742	42770	42728	42728	He	103	“ Thank you for getting me out of the ceremony . I really did n’t want to watch Josh take the reins of my parents ’ company . ”
42771	42780	42781	42781	Eli	103	“ Tell me how you started Sable Concierge , ”
42796	42813	42814	42814	He	103	“ I ’m organized . I ’m bossy . I ’m good at being an assistant . ”
42928	42950	42951	42951	She	111	“ Sounds like an organized , bossy person would be perfect running your parents ’ company . Why did n’t you ? ”
42962	42986	42951	42951	She	111	“ Sawyer Financial is n’t exactly thrilling . Besides , you do n’t appear overly eager to take on COO for your parents . ”
42987	42990	42991	42991	he	103	“ Father , ”
43000	43003	42995	42995	his	103	“ Oh . ”
43004	43016	42995	42995	his	103	“ My mother passed a day short of my fifteenth birthday . ”
43017	43023	43024	43024	Her	111	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
43094	43119	43120	43120	He	103	“ She wrecked on the highway on her way to buy my gift . The video game I wanted was in the passenger seat . ”
43129	43132	43120	43120	He	103	“ Eli … ”
43151	43166	43167	43167	She	111	“ I ’m not the best person for COO of Crane Hotels , Sable . ”
43232	43244	43245	43245	she	111	“ Your father and brothers believe you ’re perfect for COO , ”
43248	43256	43245	43245	she	111	“ They believe COO is your legacy — ”
43257	43258	43316	43316	His	103	“ Don’t”—he
43262	43268	43326	43326	his	103	hand—“give me the Batman speech . ”
43269	43274	43326	43326	his	103	“ The Batman speech ? ”
43275	43315	43316	43316	His	103	“ About how I owe Gotham a debt that would be paid in full by my suiting up and fighting crime . Or , in this case , reporting for duty at the top floor of the Crane Hotel . ”
43329	43339	43326	43326	his	103	“ Ah , this is well - tread territory . ”
43340	43350	43351	43351	he	103	“ You need mudding tires to go in there , ”
43446	43456	43440	43440	she	111	“ What is Zach ’s role in the charity ? ”
43524	43537	43520	43520	Eli	103	“ top - notch craftsmanship , styled to the individual ’s needs . ”
43583	43597	43598	43598	Eli	103	“ Zach is a commercial contractor who has worked with Crane Hotels before , ”
43611	43630	43598	43598	Eli	103	“ He can get ahold of great deals on materials and he ’s an honest , hardworking guy . ”
43631	43655	43656	43656	Eli	103	“ I would have guessed him hardworking , but he ’s a tad too charming for me to brand him ‘ honest . ’ ”
43661	43669	43670	43670	She	1250	“ I ca n’t find him charming ? ”
43683	43704	43672	43672	her	1250	“ You can as long as you do n’t get that swoonlike sparkle in your eye when I mention him . ”
43720	43739	43707	43707	his	103	“ Why , Eli Crane . I had no idea you were capable of this kind of flirting . ”
43756	43768	43769	43769	he	103	“ I used to be capable of a lot of things , ”
43962	43965	43958	43958	he	103	“ Eli ? ”
43966	43969	43970	43970	He	103	“ Yeah ? ”
43983	43990	43970	43970	He	103	“ Do you miss your leg ? ”
44029	44032	44033	44033	he	103	“ Yes , ”
44083	44088	44060	44060	He	103	“ In your journal — ”
44089	44098	44062	44062	her	1250	“ That you were n’t supposed to read . ”
44099	44130	44154	44154	he	103	“ I know . I ’m sorry . I was so … intrigued . You wrote you did n’t miss it . But I would think you ’d have to . ”
44131	44143	44144	44144	She	1250	“ Well , it ’d been with me my whole life . ”
44164	44217	44154	44154	he	103	“ Battle is nothing new . Men have fought brutal battles to protect what is theirs , what they love , since the beginning of time . Whenever I shipped out , I had one clear mission : keep the men and women around me safe . That was the only mission . ”
44233	44259	44260	44260	She	1250	“ I ’d sacrifice a part of my body to protect others . God knows Benji and Chris gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect me . ”
44323	44351	44320	44320	Unexpectedly	189	“ They gave the way you would have , Eli . They protected you . You ca n’t deny them the same right to protect their friend . ”
44352	44358	44359	44359	His	103	“ They should n’t have . ”
44379	44389	44359	44359	His	103	“ Christopher had children . Benji had a wife . ”
44390	44395	44441	44441	his	103	“ That ’s heartbreaking . ”
44396	44432	44359	44359	His	103	“ I know what it ’s like to grow up without a mom . Christopher ’s kids wo n’t ever see their father again — and Benji wo n’t get the chance to have children . ”
44480	44485	44521	44521	her	1230	“ For what it ’s worth”—Isa
44491	44517	44521	44521	her	1230	squeeze—“I’m glad your friends sacrificed for you to be here . If you ’d have all been lost , I ’d never have met you . ”
44561	44571	44572	44572	she	1230	“ You do n’t dwell , I ’ve noticed , ”
44575	44580	44572	44572	she	1230	“ No reason to . ”
44610	44679	44597	44597	He	103	“ Yes , but I think it ’s because you ’re simply not a dweller . It ’s like you said , men have been sacrificing parts of themselves as long as humans have been on the earth . You know that , you accept that . The same way you lost your leg and accepted it . The same way , ultimately , you accepted my help . ”
44680	44687	44688	44688	She	1230	“ Were you inevitable , Sable ? ”
44798	44800	44802	44802	her	1230	“ I admit”—she
44827	44871	44802	44802	her	1230	candlelight—“you drew me in . I mean , I did n’t have a choice . You unsheathed your claws and stomped off every assistant I sent you . It was either show up myself or let you ruin my hard - won reputation . ”
44955	44964	44965	44965	he	103	“ Beauty is a rare thing in war , ”
44990	45024	44982	44982	she	1230	“ When I came home , I did n’t find beauty here . Months of rehabilitation , keeping my head down and working on the Refurbs project became my focus . Then you … ”
45037	45052	44982	44982	she	1230	“ You come along , Sable , and absolutely choke a room with it . ”
45079	45083	45076	45076	she	1230	“ Thank you . ”
45084	45095	45076	45076	she	1230	“ I ’m not talking about the way you look . ”
45108	45120	45121	45121	She	1230	“ I mean your spirit . You ’re fierce . Strong . ”
45201	45207	45194	45194	He	103	“ Come home with me . ”
45222	45225	45194	45194	He	103	“ Um … ”
45239	45242	45243	45243	He	103	“ Sorry . ”
45256	45273	45243	45243	He	103	“ I have n’t done this in a while — a long while . Not since — ”
45274	45277	45278	45278	He	103	“ Eli . ”
45315	45325	45326	45326	she	1230	“ I was going to suggest my place instead , ”
45329	45334	45326	45326	she	1230	“ It ’s closer . ”
45491	45494	45487	45487	their	1268	“ Sable . ”
45495	45513	45514	45514	She	1230	“ I know . I did n’t even think about it when I suggested we come here . ”
45527	45543	45523	45523	his	103	“ We can go to your place . I do n’t expect you to compromise . ”
45544	45551	45487	45487	their	1268	“ What are you talking about ? ”
45552	45556	45557	45557	She	1230	“ The stairs . ”
45561	45573	45557	45557	She	1230	“ There are a thousand stairs leading to my front door . ”
45585	45590	45574	45574	He	103	“ I see that . ”
45591	45604	45487	45487	their	1268	“ But you can’t … or maybe you do n’t want to — ”
45605	45617	45618	45618	His	103	“ If you ’re having second thoughts , just say it . ”
45811	45814	45833	45833	She	111	“ Sable — ”
45815	45832	45833	45833	She	111	“ You know what ? I ’m going to go . I ’ll see you Monday . ”
46704	46708	46709	46709	he	103	“ Nice shoes , ”
46758	46762	46763	46763	she	110	“ Mr. Crane , ”
46840	46842	46855	46855	He	103	“ shit ”
46874	46884	46855	46855	He	103	“ Need you to dig into these for me . ”
46885	46893	46894	46894	She	110	“ And what are ‘ these ’ ? ”
46914	46958	46894	46894	She	110	“ Candidates for Refurbs . I need estimates on what kind of upgrades each of them requires . Zach ’s estimations are in there , along with my budget . You can go through and tell me what fits and what does n’t . ”
46965	46975	46959	46959	Her	110	“ I also need you to schedule the construction . ”
46976	46982	46983	46983	She	110	“ Schedule … the construction ? ”
46993	47001	46983	46983	She	110	“ Eli , I know nothing about — ”
47002	47034	47035	47035	She	110	“ There is an estimate of man - hours and materials in the folder from Zach . If you have questions , call him . His phone number is in there . ”
47063	47070	47071	47071	he	1298	“ Why are you wearing those ? ”
47077	47080	47081	47081	She	110	“ These ? ”
47089	47125	47081	47081	She	110	“ I wear them when I drive . My eyes have been getting tired from staring at a computer day and night . I do have to actually run Sable Concierge in addition to working here doing”—she
47128	47133	47134	47134	She	110	folder—“construction scheduling , apparently . ”
47160	47170	47171	47171	She	110	“ You sure you want me to call Zach ? ”
47181	47186	47171	47171	She	110	“ Be my guest . ”
47328	47345	47346	47346	he	1298	“ My lunch is prepared for the week , so I wo n’t be needing takeout , ”
47381	47411	47412	47412	He	1298	“ I have a coffeemaker in my office now , so you ’re off coffee duty . You have your orders , Sergeant . I suggest you get started . ”
47535	47538	47539	47539	she	111	“ Fine , ”
47760	47771	47752	47752	she	111	“ Sorry I freaked out . Care to try again ? ”
48194	48197	48198	48198	She	111	“ Eli ! ”
48262	48266	48267	48267	His	103	“ Get out ! ”
48289	48293	48294	48294	Her	111	“ What happened ? ”
48312	48315	48300	48300	she	111	“ Go ! ”
48391	48397	48398	48398	she	111	“ Is it your knee ? ”
48436	48442	48428	48428	she	111	“ Is it your knee ? ”
48443	48446	48447	48447	he	103	“ Foot , ”
48507	48510	48511	48511	he	103	“ No , ”
48527	48543	48544	48544	She	111	“ I ’m going to help . Do you want to stop hurting or not ? ”
48597	48613	48592	48592	Eli	103	“ You have to trust me . It ’s nothing I have n’t seen before . ”
48622	48632	48619	48619	she	111	“ The morning you were doing sit - ups ? ”
48633	48644	48645	48645	He	103	“ You mean when you could n’t look at me ? ”
48707	48728	48698	48698	she	111	“ I could n’t look at you that day because I was so attracted to you I could n’t breathe . ”
48753	48765	48766	48766	He	103	“ Eli . Let me go so I can help you . ”
48813	48816	48802	48802	She	111	“ Here ? ”
48830	48833	48834	48834	She	111	“ Here ? ”
48843	48846	48847	48847	She	111	“ Higher . ”
48949	48960	48941	48941	He	103	“ I was n’t sure I was doing that right . ”
48978	48983	48984	48984	he	103	“ It ’s stupid , ”
48987	49028	48984	48984	he	103	“ It not stupid . You suffered a major injury . One that took the lives of two of your friends and literally took a part of you . There ’s nothing stupid about what happened to you , Eli . ”
49081	49087	49091	49091	he	103	“ Saturday night , I — ”
49233	49239	49240	49240	he	103	“ Tell me to stop , ”
49245	49248	49240	49240	he	103	“ Why ? ”
49263	49267	49249	49249	She	111	“ Will you ? ”
49268	49271	49272	49272	He	103	“ Yes . ”
49281	49304	49305	49305	She	111	“ But I do n’t want to stop , Sable . Not until you ’re naked and satisfied and out of breath . ”
49313	49326	49305	49305	She	111	“ Then I ’d be a fool to ask you to stop . ”
49327	49330	49331	49331	His	103	“ Agreed . ”
49425	49433	49434	49434	she	111	“ If only you had your knife , ”
49443	49452	49434	49434	she	111	“ This process could be so much faster . ”
49453	49459	49460	49460	His	103	“ Do n’t tempt me . ”
49948	49951	49970	49970	he	103	“ Yes . ”
49952	49957	49958	49958	His	103	“ Yes to what ? ”
49984	49994	49970	49970	he	103	“ Yes to you . Yes to right now . ”
50034	50039	50019	50019	she	111	“ Yes to this . ”
50088	50093	50094	50094	she	111	“ What say you ? ”
50135	50141	50142	50142	He	103	“ In case of emergency . ”
50152	50158	50142	50142	He	103	“ This is an emergency . ”
50212	50222	50204	50204	He	103	“ Do you always keep condoms in your office ? ”

54339	54349	54350	54350	he	103	“ Or maybe you should n’t fucking question it , ”
54368	54371	54380	54380	his	103	“ Hmm ? ”
54383	54386	54380	54380	his	103	“ Sable . ”
54450	54458	54459	54459	She	111	“ Thought you might need a snack . ”

54657	54672	54645	54645	He	103	“ You think we ’re doing this in here again , you ’re wrong . ”

54702	54722	54695	54695	her	111	“ I liked it very much , but I believe you came in here to remind me of lunch . ”
54741	54762	54734	54734	he	103	“ I ’m going to lay you down and have a taste of what you ’re not covering with underwear . ”
54775	54782	54763	54763	Her	111	“ Like that , do you ? ”

55053	55060	55061	55061	He	103	“ I ’m not on duty . ”
55079	55100	55061	55061	He	103	“ They ’re clean . I do n’t like making the bed . More comfortable to slide into it messy . ”

57063	57068	57069	57069	he	103	“ You ’re okay ? ”
57072	57089	57069	57069	he	103	“ Why would n’t I be okay ? You gave me the orgasms of my life . ”
57096	57105	57090	57090	He	103	“ Orgasms … as in more than one ? ”

57878	57879	57880	57880	I	0	” “
57894	57983	58005	58005	I	0	” After working late , Isa invited Chloe up to her apartment for a drink . She needed a girlfriend and when she thought of who she had to talk to , the only friends who came to mind were work friends . Plus , Isa liked Chloe . She trusted her , too . Isa pulled open a cabinet and put the glasses on her breakfast bar . Wordlessly , Chloe uncorked the bottle and poured two glasses . When Isa grabbed hers , her friend said , “
57990	58000	58001	58001	Us	1416	” Isa lowered her glass away from her mouth . “
58003	58004	58001	58001	Us	1416	” “
58030	58041	58027	58027	I	0	” Chloe twisted a finger around one of her curls . “
58046	58067	58027	58027	I	0	” Isa gave up and took a drink , letting the cabernet wash over her tongue in a fruity wave . “
58093	58094	58098	58098	him	1417	” “
58109	58110	58104	58104	I	0	” “
58117	58126	58104	58104	I	0	” Chloe waggled a finger back and forth . “
58137	58138	58132	58135	that hunk of man	1420	” “
58144	58150	58142	58142	Zach	156	” Isa batted her lashes . “
58154	58160	58151	58152	Elijah Crane	103	” Chloe pointed a finger . “
58164	58165	58151	58152	Elijah Crane	103	” “
58171	58193	58151	58152	Elijah Crane	103	” Isa pulled out a stool at the counter and sat . Chloe clapped her hands together and eagerly followed suit . “
58214	58239	58205	58205	I	0	” she added . Chloe had already busted her this afternoon and to be fair , Isa had n’t bothered fixing what Eli called her “
58241	58244	58245	58245	JBF	196	” hair . “
58247	58266	58245	58245	JBF	196	” she ’d asked , resting her chin on his bare chest as they lay in his bed . “
58271	58305	58205	58205	I	0	” She ’d slapped his chest in reprimand , but it ’d only earned her a dry , rough laugh that made her heart patter . She had such a thing for him . “
58327	58343	58344	58344	I	0	” Chloe spread her fingers over her collarbone and did her best Scarlett O’Hara impression . “
58355	58356	58344	58344	I	0	” “
58371	58375	58344	58344	I	0	” Isa teased . “
58380	58387	58344	58344	I	0	” Another grin from her friend . “
58393	58414	58344	58344	I	0	” Chloe muzzled a sharp squeal with her hands covering her mouth . Then she reclaimed her composure and waved a “
58417	58420	58344	58344	I	0	” motion . “
58424	58436	58437	58437	He’s	1423	” No interruption this time , so Isa told her more . “
58472	58473	58463	58470	An ex who did a number on him	1425	” “
58477	58485	58492	58492	his	1423	” Chloe guessed , not totally wrong . “
58531	58545	58527	58527	he	1423	” She stabbed her lip with her teeth before she said too much . “
58555	58556	58559	58559	I	0	” “
58569	58577	58562	58562	I	0	” But then she shared them anyway . “
58637	58638	58632	58632	He	1423	” “
58650	58654	58655	58655	Special	197	” Chloe asked . “
58657	58662	58655	58655	Special	197	” Isa answered frankly . “
58708	58724	58695	58695	I	0	” Which was exactly why she ’d chickened out after the dinner at Benicia ’s . “
58741	58772	58773	58773	You	0	” Isa said with a small laugh . They ’d moved so far past that point , it was hard to believe that ’s where she ’d started with him . “
58782	58794	58776	58776	your	0	” Chloe shook her head as if it should be obvious . “
58844	58845	58832	58832	Your	0	” “
58849	58856	58847	58847	you	111	” Isa said , sincerely humbled . “
58894	58927	58889	58892	the person running it	1437	” Isa ’s heart swelled — with pride and gratitude . The kind of approval her hardworking associate had poetically delivered was what Isa had sought for years but had never received . “
58932	58938	58889	58892	the person running it	1437	” Chloe raised her wineglass . “
58942	58964	58939	58940	Sable Concierge	117	” Isa agreed , clinking their glasses and taking a sip . She cocked her head to one side in thought . “
58967	58977	58939	58940	Sable Concierge	117	” Chloe asked with a wide - eyed blink . “
58994	59006	59007	59007	Partner	1439	” Chloe ’s mouth dropped open and her cheeks went rosy . “
59009	59010	59007	59007	Partner	1439	” “
59034	59035	59030	59032	an additional supervisor	1443	” “

59051	59052	59037	59037	you	0	” “
59056	59082	59037	59037	you	0	” Isa stood and went to the fridge . She unwrapped the foil on a 72 percent dark chocolate bar with almonds and sea salt . “
59085	59095	59037	59037	you	0	” Isa said , handing a square to Chloe . “

59158	59168	59127	59127	I	0	” Isa asked , taking a square for herself . “
59176	59177	59127	59127	I	0	” “
59182	59199	59127	59127	I	0	” Isa bit into her chocolate , enjoying the perfect pairing with the fruity red wine . “
59207	59222	59203	59203	You	0	” Chloe pushed an invisible pair of eyeglasses onto the bridge of her nose . “
59231	59281	59228	59229	Isabella Sawyer	110	” Isa placed the wineglass to her lips and smiled against the rim . She had an answer , but it seemed inappropriate to admit that her weakness lately was a tall , dark - haired , blue - eyed Marine with a husky laugh and a talented tongue . “
59291	59296	59284	59284	I	0	” Isa said instead . “
59313	59365	59284	59284	I	0	” Chloe broke off another piece of chocolate and Isa continued the interview , glad she had someone under her employ who was capable and smart and believed in Sable Concierge as much as she did . No matter what happened with Eli or the Cranes , at least she had Chloe .
59369	59380	59381	59381	Isa	111	“ You are kinkier than I imagined , Isabella Sawyer . ”
59444	59454	59455	59455	He	103	“ Working from bed and wearing nothing at all . ”
59480	59488	59489	59489	She	111	“ Do n’t you find sex invigorating ? ”
59545	59567	59568	59568	He	103	“ Intense , yes . Amazing , absolutely . Invigorating , not quite . All I want to do is nap . ”
59616	59620	59626	59626	he	103	“ You should . ”
59621	59625	59626	59626	he	103	“ Ca n’t , ”
59629	59634	59626	59626	he	103	“ Shit to do . ”
59635	59650	59651	59651	His	103	“ I hear you . That ’s why I gave my assistant a promotion . ”
59655	59659	59651	59651	His	103	“ Oh yeah ? ”
59660	59700	59701	59701	She	111	“ Oh , yeah . Chloe and I discussed a partnership , but we agreed her taking on the role of senior manager was a better fit . Now we have to hire a new assistant for the office . ”
59709	59731	59701	59701	She	111	“ Maybe more than one . With two people running the office , there ’s bound to be twice the workload . ”
59732	59735	59736	59736	Eli	103	“ Yeah . ”
59741	59744	59736	59736	Eli	103	“ So … ”
59753	59757	59758	59758	she	111	“ So … , ”
59761	59776	59758	59758	she	111	“ I was considering something similar with Refurbs . Hiring someone to run it . ”
59777	59780	59784	59784	his	103	“ But ? ”
59787	59798	59784	59784	his	103	“ But it ’s not easy to give up control . ”
59799	59822	59823	59823	She	111	“ No , but it ’s smart . A team can do tenfold what you can do alone . You know this . ”
59827	59847	59823	59823	She	111	“ Crane Hotels could n’t be what it is without thousands of staff members and a board of directors . ”
59877	59930	59865	59865	Eli	103	“ Without a staff , you ’re weighed down by the little things . If you found someone , or a few someones , to run the charity — handle the e - mail , flyers , website , scheduling — then you could be free of the duties weighing you down . ”
59949	59980	59931	59931	He	103	“ I can make a few calls . I know a lot of very capable people . Then you could be involved but only do what you want to do . ”
59986	59997	59981	59981	She	111	“ That sounds like you , do n’t you think ? ”
60008	60015	60016	60016	she	111	“ What would you do instead ? ”
60077	60088	60089	60089	He	103	“ Hmm . What would I do instead of work ? ”
60098	60110	60089	60089	He	103	“ Lie in bed and watch TV ? Start a harem ? ”
60111	60115	60116	60116	she	111	“ A harem ! ”
60152	60162	60142	60142	She	111	“ Not that it makes any difference to me . ”
60163	60166	60192	60192	his	103	“ Hey . ”
60176	60189	60190	60190	He	103	“ Do you see any women hanging around waiting to join us ? ”
60206	60209	60210	60210	she	111	“ No , ”
60352	60366	60339	60339	Eli	103	“ It would be nice to let go of the particulars in Refurbs . ”
60378	60404	60371	60371	his	103	“ But it ’d have to be the perfect candidate . I ca n’t let this go to just anyone . It ’s too important . ”
60405	60417	60418	60418	His	103	“ Believe me , I understand putting your passion to work . ”
60422	60431	60418	60418	His	103	“ Maybe you could ask around for me . ”
60432	60436	60437	60437	She	111	“ No problem . ”
60473	60477	60478	60478	He	103	“ Not now . ”
60483	60487	60478	60478	He	103	“ Why not ? ”
60488	60497	60519	60519	he	103	“ Because we have other things to do . ”
60498	60502	60503	60503	He	103	“ Like what ? ”
60533	60537	60538	60538	He	103	“ Like sleeping . ”
60546	60547	60549	60549	his	103	“ Or”—he
60553	60555	60549	60549	his	103	arm—“resting . ”
60556	60559	60549	60549	his	103	“ Resting ? ”
60560	60569	60570	60570	he	103	“ You ’ve heard of it , right ? ”
60580	60595	60570	60570	he	103	“ It ’s when you lie still and listen as your heart rate slows . ”
60774	60781	60782	60782	He	103	“ You ’re terrible at resting . ”
60870	60885	60886	60886	she	111	“ While you were sleeping , I found two candidates perfect for running Refurbs , ”
60889	60919	60920	60920	She	111	“ They have past charity experience and one of them is a personal friend of mine . I put together a sort of fact sheet on each of them . ”
60938	60943	60944	60944	he	103	“ You like lists , ”
60971	60985	60947	60947	his	103	“ I do . Nothing gets done unless I write it down first . ”
60986	60994	60995	60995	He	103	“ Have you always been like that ? ”
61036	61052	61029	61029	her	111	“ I … yeah . I have . Organized . Neat . Ready to help . ”
61053	61073	61074	61074	he	103	“ But it did n’t sit well with your parents when you did n’t want to run their empire , ”
61114	61123	61124	61124	She	1468	“ I wanted to pave my own way . ”
61132	61150	61124	61124	She	1468	“ What about you ? What is it about Crane Hotels that makes you run and hide ? ”
61151	61157	61158	61158	He	103	“ I ’m not hiding . ”
61196	61202	61190	61190	he	103	“ I ’ve been busy . ”
61203	61207	61208	61208	She	1468	“ Not anymore . ”
61215	61252	61208	61208	She	1468	“ You can do Crane work once we have Refurbs handed off to a responsible manager . Then you can park in a big , plush office and get an assistant who answers your ringing phone . ”
61253	61259	61260	61260	He	103	“ I have an office . ”
61273	61279	61260	61260	He	103	“ I have an assistant . ”
61287	61294	61260	61260	He	103	“ You smell good , Sable . ”
61295	61300	61301	61301	They	1471	“ So do you . ”
61322	61332	61333	61333	he	103	“ I do n’t expect you to stay forever , ”
61346	61349	61333	61333	he	103	“ No ? ”
61350	61365	61366	61366	His	103	“ No . Stay until I wrap up Refurbs . Finish my unfinished business . ”
61439	61445	61446	61446	Isa	111	“ Is that a demand ? ”
61451	61466	61467	61467	He	103	“ I did n’t hear a question mark at the end of that statement . ”
61477	61482	61467	61467	He	103	“ Not a demand . ”
61533	61537	61538	61538	he	103	“ A request , ”
61541	61552	61538	61538	he	103	“ In that case , I ’m glad to stay . ”
61564	61585	61556	61556	her	111	“ And if you need me to help with your transition to COO , I ’ll stay a little longer . ”
61586	61592	61593	61593	He	103	“ You ’d do that ? ”
61621	61625	61601	61601	her	111	“ Of course . ”
61751	61758	61759	61759	He	103	“ Whatever you think is best . ”
61815	61818	61819	61819	She	111	“ Sable . ”
61825	61833	61819	61819	She	111	“ Do you have plans for dinner ? ”
62103	62108	62109	62109	she	111	“ Isa , seriously , ”
62171	62183	62184	62185	the blonde	1490	“ Oh , I ’m so glad you could make it ! ”
62228	62233	62234	62234	Tag	108	“ Hey , Cap’n , ”
62244	62250	62251	62251	Isa	111	“ Are you addressing me ? ”
62256	62261	62251	62251	Isa	111	“ He does that . ”
62283	62289	62290	62290	She	119	“ He calls me Dimples . ”
62303	62322	62290	62290	She	119	“ That ’s because you have two of the cutest ones I ’ve ever seen in my life . ”
62355	62358	62352	62352	Tag	108	“ worked . ”
62433	62440	62441	62441	Rachel	119	“ He does that , too , ”
62575	62583	62584	62584	He	108	“ hook , line , and sinker . ”
62649	62653	62654	62654	Tag	108	“ Perfect timing , ”
62669	62681	62654	62654	Tag	108	“ Looks like we wo n’t waste away waiting for sustenance . ”
62799	62814	62815	62815	Merina	116	“ Well , well , if it is n’t Elijah Crane ’s personal assistant , ”
62826	62840	62841	62841	Reese	104	“ We were surprised to hear we were adding a meal for you , ”
62865	62872	62873	62873	Merina	116	“ He means ‘ happy , ’ ”
62876	62887	62873	62873	Merina	116	“ We were happy to hear you were joining us . ”
62888	62895	62896	62896	Reese	104	“ No , I meant surprised , ”
62899	62909	62896	62896	Reese	104	“ Eli has a way of pushing people away . ”
62910	62916	62917	62917	Tag	108	“ It ’s a gift , ”
62928	62943	62944	62944	Reese	104	“ You have n’t gone anywhere even though he ’s fired half your staff , ”
62949	62955	62944	62944	Reese	104	“ A third , actually . ”
62991	62997	62998	62998	Isa	111	“ I can handle Eli , ”
63001	63006	63007	63007	Tag	108	“ I ’ll bet . ”
63012	63018	63007	63007	Tag	108	“ I meant the workload , ”
63056	63064	63042	63042	She	111	“ Here , let me carry one . ”
63065	63070	63071	63071	Rachel	119	“ Leave her alone , ”
63083	63094	63079	63079	She	119	“ You should keep your arms free to greet Eli . ”
63146	63158	63159	63159	Merina	116	“ You are missing out not getting to meet Alex Crane , ”
63166	63189	63159	63159	Merina	116	“ It ’s easier to understand where those three are coming from when you meet the cloth from which they were cut . ”
63242	63246	63247	63247	Merina	116	“ Holy shit , ”
63255	63264	63265	63265	Rachel	119	“ That was some serious eye - fucking . ”
63269	63274	63275	63275	Merina	116	“ I love you . ”
63303	63312	63298	63298	Eli	103	“ I presume the actual fucking is better . ”
63342	63345	63330	63330	She	116	“ Uh … ”
63346	63354	63355	63355	Rachel	119	“ This is Merina off the clock , ”
63362	63378	63359	63359	she	119	“ Though , I ’m pretty sure this is Merina on the clock , too . ”
63379	63400	63401	63401	Merina	116	“ I have no clock - in or clock - out time . It ’s all the same to me . ”
63421	63437	63403	63403	her	116	“ Crane men are difficult , but worth it if you ’re willing to push . ”
63438	63442	63443	63443	Rachel	119	“ And pull , ”
63449	63456	63457	63457	They	1516	“ It ’s a little soon … ”
63474	63504	63466	63466	Merina	116	“ You ’re right . I ’m sorry . These things take time . I forget not everyone is married instantaneously , then work the hard stuff out after . ”
63505	63514	63515	63515	Isa	111	“ I bet there ’s a story there , ”
63596	63620	63589	63589	Merina	116	“ There is a story . Maybe if things work out with you and Eli , someday I ’ll tell it to you . ”
63654	63663	63664	63664	Merina	116	“ Well . Something to look forward to . ”
63681	63687	63688	63688	Tag	108	“ The girls love her , ”
63761	63768	63769	63769	Reese	104	“ Apparently , so do you , ”
63800	63805	63797	63797	his	104	“ Easy , Cupid . ”
63831	63835	63823	63827	a woman he ’d dated	1525	“ We click . ”
63836	63842	63843	63843	Tag	108	“ Is that a euphemism ? ”
63866	63871	63850	63850	He	108	“ I need another . ”
63897	63905	63906	63906	Reese	104	“ Why ’d you invite her tonight ? ”
63913	63920	63921	63921	Tag	108	“ Do n’t be a dick , ”
63925	63935	63921	63921	Tag	108	“ You do n’t have to answer that , E. ”
63936	63947	63955	63955	his	108	“ Gee , thanks for the permission slip , Taggart . ”
64006	64022	64045	64045	Dad	131	“ You guys are the ones who wanted me to invite her to a dinner . ”
64071	64079	64080	64080	Reese	104	“ It ’s good you asked her , ”
64083	64090	64080	64080	Reese	104	“ Shows you trust your gut . ”
64091	64096	64097	64097	Eli	103	“ She ’s different , ”
64100	64104	64097	64097	Eli	103	“ Than Crystal ? ”
64110	64114	64097	64097	Eli	103	“ Than anyone . ”
64181	64190	64191	64191	Tag	108	“ Makes sense that the relationship is different , ”
64194	64228	64191	64191	Tag	108	“ You ’re home for the first time permanently . It ’s a game changer . No chance of you running off to another country to catch a breather in a few weeks . ”
64246	64249	64235	64235	he	108	“ What ? ”
64250	64253	64254	64254	He	103	“ Nothing . ”
64301	64304	64305	64305	Isa	111	“ Hey . ”
64327	64335	64315	64315	She	111	“ We ’re in need of refills . ”
64350	64356	64345	64345	Reese	104	“ Seems serious in here . ”
64371	64378	64357	64357	Isa	111	“ You must be discussing Refurbs . ”

64396	64404	64405	64405	she	111	“ Refurbs for Vets . The charity ? ”
64450	64453	64454	64454	he	103	“ Yeah , ”
64458	64463	64454	64454	he	103	“ You guessed it . ”
64464	64477	64478	64478	She	111	“ I’ll … um … go open this in the living room . ”
64506	64510	64492	64492	Reese	104	“ What charity ? ”
64517	64546	64492	64492	Reese	104	“ One of the reasons I ’ve been too busy for Crane business is because I started a charity for injured vets … with a focus on amputees . ”
64593	64600	64605	64605	her	116	“ You have to meet Alex , ”
64688	64694	64695	64695	Isa	111	“ What ’s Alex like ? ”

64780	64789	64790	64790	Reese	104	“ You ’re more like Mom than Dad , ”
64793	64804	64790	64790	Reese	104	“ Or , at least , you have her hair . ”
64839	64842	64821	64821	Rachel	119	“ Taggart . ”
64857	64863	64853	64853	she	119	“ He hates that name . ”
64868	64876	64864	64864	Merina	116	“ It ’s too regal for him . ”

64900	64911	64912	64912	Isa	111	“ At least Rachel calls you by your given name , ”
64922	64936	64912	64912	Isa	111	“ Eli does n’t like my name , so he calls me Sable . ”
64937	64940	64941	64941	Merina	116	“ Eli ! ”
65020	65027	65007	65007	she	116	“ Sable . That ’s sexy . ”

65133	65142	65127	65127	Rachel	119	“ What are your parents like , Isa ? ”
65143	65166	65167	65167	She	111	“ My father is English . My mother is Spanish , but grew up in Greece . I ’m a mixed bag . ”
65196	65213	65214	65214	Murmurs	203	“ They own Sawyer Financial Group , which I ’m sure you ’ve all heard of . ”
65219	65242	65214	65214	Murmurs	203	“ My father is professional and intelligent , and my mother works hard at both business and the business of being social . ”
65243	65246	65247	65247	Merina	116	“ Socialite , ”
65258	65264	65265	65265	Isa	111	“ She ’s a master , ”
65268	65284	65285	65285	Reese	104	“ I ’ve met Helena . She ’s both a socialite and an intelligent businesswoman , ”
65289	65295	65285	65285	Reese	104	“ You look like her . ”
65296	65302	65303	65303	Eli	103	“ Beautiful , he means , ”
65379	65388	65375	65375	Isa	111	“ You know , it ’s getting late . ”
65400	65407	65408	65408	she	116	“ For me , I mean , ”
65427	65431	65417	65417	Tag	108	“ I see . ”
65432	65441	65442	65442	Isa	111	“ No , that ’s not what I — ”
65445	65453	65454	65454	Reese	104	“ Time to call it a night . ”
65464	65481	65454	65454	Reese	104	“ It ’s okay , Isa . We ’ve all been there . The infatuation stage . ”
65510	65528	65529	65529	Tag	108	“ We ’re not used to Eli having anyone — I mean , anything — to do , ”
65563	65572	65553	65553	Eli	103	“ I assume everyone knows the way out . ”
65643	65651	65652	65652	Isa	111	“ I ’m sorry . He ’s … ”
65676	65683	65684	65684	Merina	116	“ Do n’t apologize for him , ”
65687	65695	65696	65696	She	116	“ He can do that for himself . ”
65726	65731	65721	65721	Tag	108	“ It ’s back ? ”
65753	65757	65742	65742	he	108	“ The pain ? ”
65803	65823	65789	65789	she	111	“ Um . Sometimes . Rarely . I massaged his foot the other day and it helped a lot . ”
65824	65839	65840	65840	Tag	108	“ He does n’t share stuff like that . Does n’t confide in us . ”
65845	65854	65840	65840	Tag	108	“ Does he tell you things , Cap’n ? ”
65877	65881	65882	65882	Tag	108	“ He does . ”
65888	65898	65882	65882	Tag	108	“ Good . I ’m glad he has you . ”
65908	65912	65899	65899	Rachel	119	“ Everything okay ? ”
65913	65934	65935	65935	Reese	104	“ Yeah , Dimples . We ’re leaving the Cap’n in charge , and that ’s not a bad thing . ”
65946	65954	65941	65941	Rachel	119	“ Isabella , good to see you . ”
65955	65960	65935	65935	Reese	104	“ Thanks for dinner . ”
65961	65964	65965	65965	He	108	“ Anytime . ”
65982	65994	65995	65995	Isa	111	“ I ’m going to check on him before I go , ”
66009	66022	66023	66023	Tag	108	“ You let us know if there ’s anything we can do , ”
66032	66038	66023	66023	Tag	108	“ We ’re not far . ”
66078	66081	66082	66082	She	111	“ Eli ? ”
66096	66101	66084	66084	her	111	“ Are you okay ? ”
66105	66108	66084	66084	her	111	“ Eli ? ”
66109	66124	66084	66084	her	111	“ Stop knocking , Sable . You want to come in , come in . ”
66187	66207	66208	66208	He	103	“ You favored your leg on the way in here . I was worried you were having an attack . ”
66228	66248	66208	66208	He	103	“ You became suddenly quiet tonight . Care to tell me why you left me alone with your family ? ”
66249	66252	66257	66257	she	111	“ No . ”
66275	66282	66257	66257	she	111	“ Wow . Are these yours ? ”
66283	66292	66293	66293	He	103	“ All of them except for this one . ”
66302	66319	66293	66293	He	103	“ Dad ’s . He has more , but that was the one he gave me . ”
66374	66385	66386	66386	She	111	“ I ’m assuming this is n’t a military medal . ”
66398	66401	66386	66386	She	111	“ Marathon . ”
66423	66430	66431	66431	she	111	“ Will you run one again ? ”
66441	66444	66431	66431	she	111	“ Maybe . ”
66464	66477	66485	66485	she	111	“ Your brothers did n’t know about the charity , did they ? ”
66501	66507	66495	66495	Eli	103	“ What did they say ? ”
66508	66527	66551	66551	he	103	“ They said they ’d feature Refurbs for Vets at future Crane events and help me raise money . ”
66535	66542	66531	66531	he	103	“ That ’s good , right ? ”
66543	66546	66551	66551	he	103	“ Yes . ”
66554	66565	66551	66551	he	103	“ I have n’t done much to deserve their help . ”
66594	66623	66583	66583	he	103	“ I do n’t understand where this is coming from , Eli . I thought we were having a good night . Your family is so great and — ”
66624	66643	66644	66644	Eli	103	“ And they ’re here for me . Because I ’m here . Not everyone gets so lucky . ”
66742	66747	66738	66738	they	1569	“ You look happy . ”
66748	66754	66757	66757	She	1570	“ I had my moments . ”
66803	66812	66813	66813	Benji	160	“ Benji does n’t get to be here . ”
66822	66831	66832	66832	she	1570	“ The one who left a wife behind , ”
66835	66838	66832	66832	she	1570	“ Sad . ”
66870	66877	66878	66878	Eli	103	“ They both left wives behind . ”
66887	66897	66883	66883	his	103	“ Benji ’s wife wo n’t talk to me . ”
66918	66922	66912	66912	she	111	“ Why not ? ”
66923	66932	66933	66933	Eli	103	“ Because she knows it ’s my fault . ”
66941	67028	66933	66933	Eli	103	“ She wo n’t return my calls and she ’s no longer checking his e - mail . Or if she is , she ’s not responding . Tonight , I was sitting there with my pain - in - the - ass family and got to thinking that Benji did n’t have any more moments with his family . No time with his wife or his brother or his parents . No one bringing him meals because his leg is gone . It ’s unfair . ”
67083	67099	67074	67074	she	1579	“ Eli , you ’re allowed to be happy even though he ’s not here . ”
67100	67112	67113	67113	he	1580	“ He ’s not here because I did n’t save him , ”
67120	67129	67113	67113	he	1580	“ I should have saved both of them . ”
67136	67169	67170	67170	She	1579	“ I have n’t known you for long but I know for a fact if there was any way you could have saved them , you would have — or died trying . ”
67182	67187	67170	67170	She	1579	“ Am I wrong ? ”
67188	67191	67194	67194	she	1579	“ No . ”
67205	67214	67194	67194	she	1579	“ But that does n’t change the facts . ”
67215	67219	67239	67239	he	1580	“ What facts ? ”
67220	67230	67232	67232	he	1580	“ I ’m not good for anyone , Sable . ”
67244	67251	67239	67239	he	1580	“ You do n’t believe that . ”
67303	67313	67314	67314	she	1579	“ You did n’t cause your friends ’ deaths , ”
67368	67379	67360	67360	Reese	104	“ And you did n’t cause your mother ’s death . ”
67392	67402	67380	67380	She	1579	“ You ’re good for a lot of people . ”
67406	67414	67380	67380	She	1579	“ What the hell do you know ? ”
67425	67443	67420	67420	his	1580	“ You , who continue coming back like a kicked dog no matter how I treat you . ”
67444	67449	67417	67417	his	1580	“ I do not . ”
67482	67498	67479	67479	his	103	“ It would n’t matter what I did , would it ? You ’d stay . ”
67499	67509	67510	67510	she	1579	“ Are you trying to make me to leave ? ”
67517	67525	67510	67510	she	1579	“ I always knew you were smart . ”
67603	67616	67598	67598	she	1579	“ You asked me to stick around today ! Change your mind ? ”
67634	67680	67623	67623	Eli	103	“ If you ’re too afraid to deal with your feelings , that ’s fine . But if you ’re treating me like shit because you do n’t want me to see them , that ’s unacceptable . Not after what I thought we had . ”
67710	67733	67701	67701	she	1579	“ You do n’t have to fire me this time , Beast Crane . I quit . Enjoy being your own assistant . ”
67958	67962	67963	67963	Chloe	112	“ Just left ? ”
67970	67973	67974	67974	Isa	111	“ Yes . ”
68059	68065	68066	68066	Chloe	112	“ Are you going back ? ”
68073	68080	68081	68081	Isa	111	“ No , I ’m not . ”
68112	68115	68116	68116	Chloe	112	“ Ever ? ”
68120	68170	68116	68116	Chloe	112	“ Sable Concierge will survive without him . You said it yourself . If he wants to behave this way , I can tie up loose ends without speaking to him . We are in the twenty - first century , you know — the height of electronic media . ”
68219	68224	68225	68225	Chloe	112	“ What about you ? ”
68249	68254	68255	68255	Isa	111	“ Are you sad ? ”
68317	68322	68323	68323	Isa	111	“ I ’m frustrated . ”
68329	68378	68323	68323	Isa	111	“ I ’m also unwilling to be treated the way he ’s treating me . If he wants to behave like an adult , then together we can adult . But if he wants to be a man - child , then he can do that by himself . ”
68379	68384	68385	68385	Chloe	112	“ You ’re smart . ”
68395	68420	68389	68389	her	112	“ You are smart and strong and one day , I ’m going to grow up to be as strong and smart as you . ”
68421	68429	68323	68323	Isa	111	“ Chloe , you ’re my age . ”
68430	68457	68458	68458	Isa	111	“ True . But if I had a really hot guy who was really good in bed , I ’m not sure I could walk away . ”
68465	68491	68458	68458	Isa	111	“ Well , lucky for you , it does n’t require any smarts to climb into bed with a man who is wrong for you . ”
68492	68499	68500	68500	Chloe	112	“ Is n’t that the truth ? ”
68518	68526	68512	68512	she	112	“ You ’re sure you ’re okay ? ”
68527	68532	68512	68512	she	112	“ I ’m fine . ”
68549	68576	68577	68577	Chloe	112	“ Okay . Let me know if you want to delegate any of your communications with Cranky Crane . I ’ll be in my new office . ”
68816	68836	68809	68809	he	103	“ Reese , I ’m working on it . I will have it to you as soon as possible . ”
68837	68842	68844	68845	his brother	370	“ You sound chipper , ”
68850	68870	68844	68845	his brother	370	“ Yeah , well , my assistant has n’t showed up for four days , so I ’m buried . ”
68891	68929	68930	68930	Smartass	206	“ Four days ? I wondered why I kept getting e - mails from you instead of Isabella . I also know you ’re busy with the charity , too . Do you how I know that ? ”
68937	68944	68932	68932	Eli	103	“ Because your girlfriend told me . ”
68945	68950	68951	68951	Eli	103	“ I was there . ”
68958	68977	68951	68951	Eli	103	“ You have my full support , Eli . You should have told me about the charity sooner . ”
69041	69046	69047	69047	he	103	“ I appreciate it , ”
69054	69072	69047	69047	he	103	“ Before Isa left , she ’d put feelers out for a manager to take over Refurbs . ”
69240	69252	69253	69253	Reese	104	“ … would appreciate your presence at tonight ’s board meeting , ”
69257	69267	69268	69268	Eli	103	“ I suck at dealing with people , Reese , ”
69271	69292	69268	69268	Eli	103	“ Is n’t it obvious ? Why do you keep insisting I come back to Crane to be around them ? ”
69335	69343	69332	69332	he	370	“ Because you belong here , Eli . ”
69355	69391	69344	69344	His	104	“ I want you there . Dad wants you there . Tag told me when we left your place Friday that the more he pictures Crane Hotels without you , the more wrong it feels . ”
69394	69403	69392	69392	Dammit	207	“ I do n’t need a guilt trip . ”
69434	69457	69458	69458	Reese	104	“ No , you do n’t . You seem to have mastered piling it on your shoulders without anyone else ’s help . ”
69466	69477	69458	69458	Reese	104	“ Why has n’t Isa been back in four days ? ”
69478	69485	69486	69486	Eli	103	“ Because I pushed her away . ”
69518	69531	69512	69512	he	103	“ She came to console me and I acted like an ass . ”
69532	69536	69547	69547	he	104	“ Sounds familiar . ”
69561	69563	69553	69554	His brother	370	“ assery ”
69597	69624	69625	69625	Eli	103	“ Anyway , I ca n’t attend tonight ’s board meeting and go to Sable Concierge to get my assistant back , now , can I ? ”
69628	69633	69625	69625	Eli	103	“ I guess not . ”
69645	69657	69625	69625	Eli	103	“ The least I can do is apologize for behaving badly . ”
69658	69663	69664	69664	Reese	104	“ The very least , ”
69740	69749	69750	69750	Reese	104	“ I ’d tell you to take flowers , ”
69753	69764	69750	69750	Reese	104	“ but that was always the kiss goodbye for me . ”
69765	69783	69784	69785	His brother	370	“ I swear I do n’t know how you talked any woman into going out with you . ”
69809	69811	69750	69750	Reese	104	“ done ”
69851	69864	69865	69865	Reese	104	“ We all fuck up , but there ’s a way back , ”
69869	69898	69865	69865	Reese	104	“ Look at Tag . Mr. Fast and Loose towed in by a cute , tiny blonde who made him want commitment . He never saw Rachel coming . ”
69899	69913	69915	69915	someone	605	“ Right , because the Cranes are allergic to long - term relationships . ”
69938	69947	69930	69930	Tag	108	“ It makes sense . Because of Mom . ”
69948	69968	69865	69865	Reese	104	“ You can keep your Freudian theories to yourself . My reasons for not settling down or getting married — twice”—Eli
69970	69988	70024	70024	his	104	snidely—“or coupling off like the rest of you seem content to do are more deep - seated . ”
69989	69994	70024	70024	his	104	“ Uh - huh . ”
69995	69999	70000	70000	Eli	103	“ Anything else ? ”
70013	70017	70018	70018	Reese	104	“ Good luck , ”
70028	70074	70024	70024	his	104	“ I mean with the report I sent over . Getting your assistant back is n’t about luck — it’ll take a miracle after how many of her PAs you fired . I hope she comes back for my sake . Your typos are horrendous . ”
70075	70083	70084	70084	Eli	103	“ Merina brought out your comedic side , ”
70087	70094	70084	70084	Eli	103	“ I do n’t like it . ”
70308	70311	70312	70312	Eli	103	“ Enough , ”
70725	70733	70734	70734	Zach	156	“ They ’ll frame it out tomorrow , ”
70746	70765	70734	70734	Zach	156	“ Good deal . Hey , I have to go . Call me tomorrow if you need me . ”
70766	70781	70734	70734	Zach	156	“ No , we ’re good . Just checking in . Later , man . ”
70782	70787	70788	70788	Eli	103	“ Thanks , Zach . ”
70826	70833	70834	70834	he	103	“ Oh , and you are ? ”
71067	71074	71051	71051	him	103	“ Eli . It ’s late . ”
71075	71089	71090	71090	She	111	“ I know . I got here an hour ago . Damn stairs . ”
71107	71113	71090	71090	She	111	“ That was a joke . ”
71127	71134	71114	71114	She	111	“ A bad one , evidently . ”
71148	71160	71135	71135	Eli	103	“ I came by to apologize for acting like an ass . ”
71161	71165	71166	71166	she	111	“ No need , ”
71250	71255	71256	71256	he	103	“ You deserve better , ”
71271	71306	71262	71262	he	103	“ Better treatment from a client and better treatment from a lover . I ’ve never been great at this stuff , and as you ’ve recently proven , I ’ve become even worse — ”
71307	71310	71318	71318	he	103	“ Eli , ”
71342	71350	71328	71328	she	111	“ Do you want to come in ? ”
71351	71363	71318	71318	he	103	“ No . I want to go out . With you . ”
71364	71367	71318	71318	he	103	“ Now ? ”
71368	71371	71318	71318	he	103	“ Please ? ”
71372	71375	71376	71376	Her	111	“ Please ? ”
71383	71414	71376	71376	Her	111	“ You were the last person I expected when I opened this door , Eli Crane . I could n’t imagine you coming here to apologize , let alone beg . ”
71415	71419	71318	71318	he	103	“ Desperate times . ”

75703	75742	75700	75700	she	111	“ I was going to say open , but you ’re not open , are you ? You ’re more like a screen over a window . I can see in , but I ca n’t get in . ”
75757	75766	75767	75767	he	103	“ I’m … not skilled at being open , ”
75778	75783	75767	75767	he	103	“ You ’re kidding . ”
75892	75902	75903	75903	She	111	“ I ’m not sure what we have here . ”
75959	75966	75967	75967	He	2877	“ I like you , Eli . ”
76058	76062	76063	76063	she	111	“ But … , ”
76091	76104	76105	76105	she	111	“ … I ca n’t keep guessing what ’s in your head , ”

76149	76159	76160	76160	He	2877	“ Do you really believe you ’re bad luck ? ”
76190	76194	76174	76174	her	111	“ Not exactly . ”
76209	76217	76195	76195	He	2877	“ Good things … don’t chase me . ”
76218	76235	76236	76236	He	2877	“ Life is about you chasing good things , Eli , not the other way around . ”
76288	76300	76282	76286	someone who could protect her	1738	“ A lot of bad things happen when I ’m around . ”
76301	76310	76311	76311	She	111	“ Are you afraid you ’ll screw up ? ”
76314	76320	76311	76311	She	111	“ We all screw up . ”
76321	76346	76347	76347	He	2877	“ Some screwups come with a hefty price , Sable . Screwups like letting my two men lead resulted in them losing their lives . ”
76352	76370	76373	76373	he	2877	“ Screwups like you being attacked because your attacker did n’t believe I could fight him off . ”
76376	76382	76373	76373	he	2877	“ And I did n’t . ”
76383	76386	76387	76387	She	111	“ No . ”
76413	76421	76408	76408	He	2877	“ It ’s a fact , Isa . ”
76422	76429	76430	76430	Her	111	“ It ’s bullshit , Eli . ”
76439	76462	76430	76430	Her	111	“ You came for me after I left , and that was a miracle . If you had n’t showed at all … ”
76473	76483	76463	76463	She	111	“ I do n’t want to think about it . ”
76545	76555	76556	76556	She	111	“ What happened to me is not your fault . ”
76561	76588	76556	76556	She	111	“ I could have been robbed , raped . He could have climbed those stairs and broken into my house while I was in the shower . ”
76597	76657	76589	76589	He	2877	“ You heard what I told the officer . That guy ’s eyes were wild like he was high on something . He was twitchy . Strange . He had n’t been lying in wait and carefully plotting . Maybe he saw you in the shadows , maybe he did n’t . It could have happened at any time . ”
76683	76703	76678	76678	he	2877	“ But if I would n’t have shown up at your door , you never would have been outside . ”
76704	76726	76727	76727	He	2877	“ If you would n’t have shown up at my door , Eli , I would n’t be here right now . ”
76763	76772	76773	76773	he	2877	“ So … you’re moving in with me , ”
76787	76799	76783	76783	she	1740	“ I have pepper spray . I ’ll be on alert . ”
76800	76827	76828	76828	Her	1740	“ And have a male employee stay late to walk you up . Finish your work upstairs and never ever head up there after dark unless — ”
76835	76839	76828	76828	Her	1740	“ I promise . ”
76952	76960	76961	76961	she	111	“ Have you ever lived with someone ? ”
76993	76996	76997	76997	he	2877	“ Yes , ”
77000	77003	76997	76997	he	2877	“ You ? ”
77004	77046	77080	77080	She	111	“ Never . Not a romantic interest , anyway . I lived at home and with a friend from college , but I ’ve mostly been on my own . Josh wanted to move in together , but it felt wrong . ”
77047	77052	77080	77080	She	111	“ You held back . ”
77053	77079	77080	77080	She	111	“ I guess so . I knew we were n’t right , but I ’m not sure I know what ‘ right ’ feels like . ”
77129	77135	77136	77136	Eli	103	“ Her name was Crystal . ”
77167	77210	77211	77211	He	2877	“ She and I met through a mutual friend . We dated for three or four months and then she moved in when I deployed . She said it ’d make her feel closer to me if she was around my things . ”
77276	77284	77285	77285	She	111	“ Do you want me to continue ? ”
77294	77341	77285	77285	She	111	“ Whenever I was back , she ’d insist we go house - hunting or talk about financial plans for our future . I would be trying to acclimate to civilian life again , settle into a temporary schedule , and Crystal wanted to play house . ”
77342	77347	77348	77348	Isa	111	“ She loved you . ”
77364	77367	77357	77357	He	2877	“ Maybe . ”
77439	77459	77431	77437	anyone who was n’t related to him	1746	“ She wanted children , a family . A house with a yard . I do n’t want that . ”
77460	77464	77507	77507	Changing	212	“ Not ever ? ”
77481	77506	77507	77507	Changing	212	“ Now I ’m not sure what I want . I ’ve changed in a lot of unexpected ways since I ’ve come back . ”
77586	77600	77578	77578	she	111	“ So this … what we have . It ’s enough for you ? ”
77654	77675	77640	77640	she	111	“ I ’m not sure I can give you more , but I ’m not done with us , either . ”
77683	77686	77679	77679	her	111	“ Okay . ”
77687	77690	77679	77679	her	111	“ Okay ? ”
77691	77696	77720	77720	he	2877	“ That ’s fair . ”
77787	77792	77793	77793	he	2877	“ I need you , ”
77796	77809	77793	77793	he	2877	“ So if you would n’t mind staying a little while long — ”
78491	78494	78495	78495	he	103	“ Shit , ”
78498	78502	78495	78495	he	103	“ Licks you ? ”
78508	78519	78520	78520	he	103	“ Likes . I typed likes . I hate texting , ”
78523	78537	78520	78520	he	103	“ I did n’t want to interrupt your work with a phone call . ”
78538	78546	78547	78547	Her	111	“ Well , it was n’t inaccurate . ”
78555	78558	78559	78559	he	103	“ No , ”

78615	78655	78605	78605	she	111	“ Tag and his buddy Lucas are dragging me out for a beer at Dooley ’s around eight . I know you ’re working late tonight , but I figured I could leave and pick you up around nine . ”

78686	78713	78605	78605	she	111	“ Sure , why not ? There ’s no sense in you driving to the other side of town when I can easily take a cab . ”
78714	78726	78742	78742	his	1777	“ A cab ? That ’s not very gentlemanly of me . ”
78727	78737	78742	78742	his	1777	“ I never accused you of being a gentleman . ”
78748	78782	78742	78742	his	1777	“ I ’m not sure when I ’ll be done . It ’s easier to just cab it there , honestly . And before you ask , yes , I have pepper spray . ”

86357	86386	86352	86352	You	112	” She did have this . Maybe she was rushing to make this work out when , like Eli said , all they needed was a little time . “
86392	86412	86352	86352	You	112	” Isa offered , moving to fetch her purse . Amazing how one conversation had left her feeling better . “

86436	86478	86352	86352	You	112	” Isa did n’t have everything figured out , but Chloe was right . When the time was right , Isa would tell him how she felt . Until then , she ’d have fun with him . She deserved nothing less .

87952	87972	87930	87930	She	224	“ I did n’t expect to visit . I was in the neighborhood and I decided to try you . ”
87973	87976	87930	87930	She	224	“ Oh . ”
88013	88020	88010	88010	Michelle	224	“ Do you want … dinner ? ”
88035	88041	88025	88025	she	224	“ That ’s not necessary . ”
88083	88092	88093	88093	Michelle	224	“ You know what ? Let me rephrase , ”
88099	88108	88093	88093	Michelle	224	“ Eli . You ’re staying for dinner . ”
88197	88203	88204	88204	Michelle	224	“ Okay , snuggle bug , ”

88316	88325	88326	88326	Michelle	224	“ You did n’t have to clean up , ”
88338	88346	88326	88326	Michelle	224	“ Your leftovers are in the fridge . ”
88370	88378	88379	88379	she	224	“ You must have a million questions , ”
88398	88402	88382	88382	He	103	“ Just one . ”
88444	88494	88439	88439	Eli	103	“ Benji and I were secretly in the adoption process . We wanted two children and thought we ’d adopt one and have one of our own and wind up with two children around the same age at the same time . The adoption went through two months ago . ”
88511	88543	88508	88508	her	224	“ She ’s everything , Eli . She healed me . I never thought I ’d recover from losing Benji , and well , I have n’t recovered . Not completely . ”
88548	88576	88508	88508	her	224	“ There are times I wish so much I had been pregnant when he died because then I ’d have a piece of him . You know ? ”
88592	88605	88588	88588	he	1954	“ I ’m not here about permission for the photo , Michelle . ”
88612	88616	88606	88606	She	224	“ I know . ”
88633	88641	88642	88642	she	224	“ You cleaned off the high chair , ”
88669	88682	88652	88652	He	1954	“ I ’m sorry , Michelle . I ’m so damn sorry . ”
88697	88707	88683	88683	She	224	“ For a long time , I blamed you . ”
88729	88743	88744	88744	she	224	“ But I ’m the one who owes you an apology , Eli , ”
88747	88752	88744	88744	she	224	“ What ? No . ”
88784	88787	88788	88788	she	224	“ Yes , ”
88802	88852	88788	88788	she	224	“ Benji loved you . Whenever we ’d talk , he ’d mention you and what an amazing person you are . He talked about the advice you gave him about everything . Fixing up his old Camaro . The best kind of beer for a hot summer evening . ”
88863	88903	88853	88853	They	1956	“ He loved you , Michelle . I feel like I know you , he mentioned you so damn often . I never should have tried to get your blessing when what I was really seeking was your forgiveness . ”

88971	89036	89037	89037	She	224	“ I realized things happen for a reason . Generic , right ? I was so angry every time someone would console me with that platitude , but it ’s true . Things happen . What no tells you is that the ‘ reason ’ is personal . It ’s up to you to figure out why you ’re going through what you are . ”
89052	89102	89037	89037	She	224	“ I ’m sorry you lost your leg , Eli . And I ’m sorry I did n’t take your calls . I told myself I was busy , but I was avoiding you . You reminded me of Benji , and having Destiny without Benji hurt at first . ”
89103	89112	89113	89113	he	1957	“ You have nothing to be sorry about , ”
89117	89129	89113	89113	he	1957	“ You have to know that I would swap places with — ”
89130	89149	89150	89150	Her	1960	“ Do n’t you dare say what I think you ’re about to say , Elijah Coolidge Crane . ”
89174	89184	89158	89158	She	1960	“ Benji told me your middle name , too . ”
89203	89218	89219	89219	she	1960	“ Do n’t you dare tell me you ’d rather be in the ground , ”
89222	89249	89219	89219	she	1960	“ because I promise you there are people in your life who would be worse for it . You lost a limb , but you lived . ”
89250	89266	89291	89291	his	1957	“ I know . That ’s what has me drowning in guilt every damned day . ”
89267	89288	89289	89289	She	1960	“ Refurbs for Vets is a good thing . You ’re giving back in an active way . And yes . ”
89294	89310	89311	89311	She	1960	“ You can use Benji ’s picture on the website . I ’d be honored . ”
89322	89362	89363	89363	He	1957	“ I forgive you . I do n’t need you to be sorry , but if you need me to say I do n’t blame you or hold you accountable , believe me when I say I do n’t . ”
89415	89481	89395	89395	she	224	“ Keep doing what you ’re doing , Eli . Benji is watching you , and he is proud . I promise . He would n’t trade places with you . If the situation were reversed , he ’d be honored if you ’d traded your life for his . Since he traded his for yours , I suggest you live yours to the fullest . ”
89482	89487	89488	89488	Eli	103	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
89528	89539	89514	89514	Michelle	224	“ I did n’t think I ’d get that lucky . ”
89540	89547	89548	89548	He	103	“ I have to go anyway . ”
89566	89570	89571	89571	Michelle	224	“ Thank you . ”
89610	89619	89620	89620	he	103	“ If you ’re really watching , buddy , ”
89629	89640	89620	89620	he	103	“ fuck you for telling your wife my middle name . ”
89674	89681	89682	89682	Tag	108	“ Dad is going to shit . ”
89765	89770	89771	89771	Eli	103	“ for a reason , ”
89861	89868	89869	89869	Reese	104	“ Do you need an office ? ”
89880	89895	89896	89896	Eli	103	“ I ’ll work from home , but I ’ll be here on occasion , ”
89899	89904	89905	89905	Tag	108	“ Need an assistant ? ”
89912	89924	89905	89905	Tag	108	“ Or will Isabella Sawyer be performing that duty among others ? ”
89925	89929	89984	89984	Reese	104	“ Very funny . ”
89930	89955	89956	89956	Tag	108	“ Unless she refuses to let you pay her . Rachel was that way — she did n’t want any part of my money . ”
89971	89978	89956	89956	Tag	108	“ Parts of me , however … ”
89979	89983	89984	89984	Reese	104	“ Moving on , ”
90008	90096	90000	90000	he	1977	“ There are several staff members performing parts of the position in your absence , Eli . I never truly replaced myself when I moved on from COO , so it ’s up to you how you want to run it . General operations is comprised of several jobs . You can keep the men and women I ’ve appointed in place and oversee them , or you can place them elsewhere and carve out an eighty - hour - a - week grindstone like I did . ”
90097	90106	90107	90107	Tag	108	“ Yeah , but you ’re a masochist , ”
90110	90118	90107	90107	Tag	108	“ And Eli has a new girlfriend . ”
90119	90126	90127	90127	Eli	103	“ All right . I give . ”

90178	90195	90196	90196	He	103	“ She ’s not going to move in with me . And I ’m not you . ”
90201	90243	90196	90196	He	103	“ If I asked her to marry me , she ’d have a heart attack that would immediately precede my own . We ’re good . We ’re together and we do n’t feel the need to define it past that . ”
90258	90261	90263	90263	Isa	111	“ good , ”
90311	90333	90334	90334	Eli	103	“ Now that we ’re done with the small talk , can I get to the rest of these bullet points ? ”
90375	90382	90367	90367	he	104	“ Give it time , bro . ”
90428	90432	90433	90433	Eli	103	“ Next item , ”

90754	90760	90761	90761	She	111	“ freezing off her ass . ”

91079	91087	91088	91088	He	103	“ You shaved your beard . Completely . ”
91102	91109	91088	91088	He	103	“ Yeah . Is it weird ? ”
91110	91116	91117	91117	God	107	“ Different , not weird . ”

91207	91221	91202	91202	he	103	“ Want to see how it feels and make your judgment call after ? ”
91222	91227	91239	91239	she	111	“ Mmm - hmm . ”
91383	91388	91389	91389	he	103	“ What about dinner ? ”
91416	91426	91403	91403	He	103	“ You sound like a good dinner to me . ”
91547	91550	91540	91540	his	103	“ Isa . ”

92029	92038	92013	92013	she	111	“ You are the most stunningly handsome man . ”
92077	92086	92065	92065	he	103	“ I never imagined someone like you existed . ”
92136	92142	92143	92143	His	103	“ Wait until after dinner . ”
92157	92173	92143	92143	His	103	“ I ’m going to make you come so hard I ’ll render you useless . ”
92191	92202	92180	92180	Eli	103	“ Do you want that ? Me rendering you useless ? ”
92210	92233	92203	92203	His	103	“ At my whim and command ? Shaking and pleading with me to stop because you ca n’t take any more pleasure ? ”
92243	92246	92248	92248	her	111	“ Yes , ”
92264	92267	92268	92268	He	103	“ Good . ”
92281	92292	92268	92268	He	103	“ I was n’t going to give you a choice . ”

92445	92454	92424	92424	She	111	“ It ’s in the oven . Lasagna . ”
92455	92460	92461	92461	He	103	“ You made lasagna ? ”
92551	92558	92559	92559	he	103	“ I did not make lasagna , ”
92571	92578	92559	92559	he	103	“ Benicia ’s Italiano made lasagna . “
92586	92587	92579	92579	I	0	” “
92590	92591	92579	92579	I	0	” “
92607	92634	92579	92579	I	0	” He sent her a wink that beckoned another heart palpitation . Then another when he lowered his lips to hers for a sweet , brief kiss .
92650	92655	92656	92656	Isa	111	“ Was that eggplant ? ”
92673	92678	92679	92679	Eli	103	“ And portobello mushrooms , ”
92682	92690	92679	92679	Eli	103	“ Why do n’t you eat meat ? ”
92726	92729	92730	92730	he	103	“ Truth ? ”
92733	92736	92730	92730	he	103	“ Always . ”
92737	92744	92745	92745	He	103	“ It ’s not dinner conversation . ”
92756	92763	92745	92745	He	103	“ I have a strong stomach . ”
92764	92771	92772	92772	he	103	“ You have a strong everything , ”
92804	92822	92823	92823	He	103	“ After witnessing the mess left behind when I lost my foot and part of my leg … ”
92832	92851	92825	92825	his	103	“ Well , without being too morbid , let ’s say my appetite for flesh went away instantly . ”
92852	92857	92825	92825	his	103	“ That makes sense . ”
92873	92884	92860	92860	her	111	“ Yeah . Not manly , but there it is . ”
92885	92891	92892	92892	She	111	“ Trust me , Eli . ”
92916	92933	92894	92894	her	111	“ No one would ever look at you and see you as ‘ not manly . ’ ”
92977	92986	92987	92987	he	103	“ Now for the reason behind this celebration , ”
93048	93055	93056	93056	he	103	“ Corporal Benjamin Hough , Junior , ”
93076	93089	93072	93072	him	103	“ Known as Benji to me and to his wife , Michelle . ”
93095	93130	93131	93131	Eli	103	“ He was the one who shoved me when Christopher dove on the grenade . He should n’t have died from the blast , but a piece of metal shot out like a dart . ”
93137	93142	93131	93131	Eli	103	“ Hit him here . ”
93169	93202	93203	93203	Eli	103	“ If that stray piece had n’t found his head , he would have been lying on the ground next to me missing a leg . Maybe two since he was closer . ”
93211	93223	93203	93203	Eli	103	“ We probably could have bitched our way through rehab together . ”
93230	93251	93224	93224	His	103	“ I went to see his wife and met her baby — one she and Benji had planned on adopting . ”
93252	93260	93203	93203	Eli	103	“ You did ? That ’s amazing . ”
93261	93322	93323	93323	Eli	103	“ It was . And it started me thinking about what I was doing with my life , whether I was living it to the fullest . I thought long and hard about what Benji would want . About what I would want for him if I was hoeing a row in heaven instead of down here on the pavement . ”
93351	93361	93362	93362	he	103	“ I do n’t want to have any regrets , ”
93369	93414	93362	93362	he	103	“ I have been holed up alone since I returned . I ’ve challenged everyone I ’ve come in contact with . With the exception of my family , you were the only one who challenged me back . The only one who stayed . ”
93476	93543	93469	93469	he	103	“ Isabella Sawyer . You asked me once if I believed I caused people pain . The answer was yes . But you let me off the hook . You said you were fine with me retreating , but you are n’t , are you ? You want me to live up to the promises I make . You push me to be a better man . ”
93585	93596	93597	93597	he	103	“ I ’m stepping in as COO at Crane Hotels , ”
93600	93612	93597	93597	he	103	“ The official announcement is happening at the Royale London event . ”
93634	93646	93647	93647	he	103	“ Good thing you already RSVPd yes for me , right ? ”
93691	93702	93703	93703	Eli	103	“ You were right to push me toward Crane Hotels , ”
93712	93742	93703	93703	Eli	103	“ You were right to encourage me to get involved . I ’m working hard to learn to go all in , and this gets me another step closer . ”
93786	93792	93793	93793	He	103	“ To you , Isa . ”
93801	93821	93793	93793	He	103	“ Thank you for helping me find where I belong . I could n’t have done it without you . ”

93899	93908	93909	93909	she	2000	“ Is this your way of being open ? ”
93922	93944	93912	93912	He	103	“ When I asked you to be open , I meant with your feelings , Eli , not your business plans . ”
93964	93985	93986	93986	She	2000	“ You know I do n’t make it a habit to mince words — or keep my opinions to myself . ”
93999	94004	93986	93986	She	2000	“ The truth is … ”
94031	94040	94041	94041	she	2000	“ I ’m falling for you , Eli , ”
94044	94060	94041	94041	she	2000	“ Hard . The kind of falling where you do n’t want to be saved . ”
94082	94159	94069	94069	She	2000	“ I want a future with you . I want to see who we can be when you ’re not holding back . I want to come home to you . Have dinner together and spend holidays together . I want to text and call and see you . I want you . All of you . Not just your body . And I definitely do n’t want you to withhold part of yourself from me . ”
94187	94195	94171	94171	Eli	103	“ I asked for time , Sable . ”
94196	94229	94245	94245	his	103	“ I know you did . I thought tonight you were ready to tell me how you felt about me . Not that you were going back to work for Crane Hotels . ”

94477	94515	94516	94516	His	103	“ This has nothing to do with Crystal . This has to do with us . Are you incapable of giving yourself to me before everything else in your life is tied in a neat little bow ? ”
94520	94526	94516	94516	His	103	“ What if I am ? ”
94536	94546	94547	94547	he	103	“ I asked for time because I need it , ”

95410	95415	95397	95397	Reese	104	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
95416	95431	95432	95432	Reese	104	“ Why does something have to be wrong for me to show up here ? ”
95438	95457	95458	95458	Eli	103	“ As it turns out , I need a space to work that is not at my house , ”
95504	95509	95486	95486	she	111	“ Too quiet there . ”
95534	95557	95526	95526	he	103	“ I thought you liked quiet . You ’ve spent the year trying to get Tag and me to leave you alone . ”
95558	95569	95570	95570	Eli	103	“ I know . I do n’t understand it either . ”

95737	95740	95741	95741	Eli	103	“ Hmm . ”
95764	95772	95746	95747	His brother	370	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
95773	95790	95691	95691	Reese	104	“ If I had to guess , I ’d say Isabella Sawyer is under your skin . ”
95821	95830	95831	95831	Eli	103	“ I came in to use an office . ”
95845	95861	95831	95831	Eli	103	“ Do I have one ? If not , I can take the conference room . ”
95862	95888	95889	95889	Reese	104	“ Dad ’s office is empty . Desk , a stapler , and a wastebasket , but otherwise empty . We saved it for you . ”
95892	95897	95889	95889	Reese	104	“ Just in case . ”
95898	95904	95905	95905	Eli	103	“ I ’ll take it , ”

96995	97013	97014	97014	Isa	111	“ My new dress is going to waste . Want to go to Posh for a martini ? ”
97017	97027	97014	97014	Isa	111	“ Chloe Andrews . Are you asking me out ? ”
97028	97035	97036	97036	She	111	“ If you ’ll have me . ”

97128	97138	97139	97139	she	111	“ You think you know what you ’re doing , ”
97145	97160	97139	97139	she	111	“ but then sex happens and you have no idea what you ’re doing . ”

97310	97319	97320	97320	Chloe	112	“ It ’s not like you broke up , ”
97323	97333	97334	97334	Isa	111	“ It ’s not like we were ever official , ”
97337	97345	97334	97334	Isa	111	“ At least you had a guy . ”
97346	97356	97357	97357	Isa	111	“ You do n’t want one . Trust me . ”
97363	97384	97357	97357	Isa	111	“ I ’m the moron who fell in love with him . I have no one to blame but myself . ”

98358	98363	98351	98351	Eli	103	“ The last one . ”
98396	98404	98405	98405	Eli	103	“ Change is n’t easy for me , ”

98666	98722	98657	98657	Reese	104	“ It ’s not an intervention . If you ’re not ready , you ’re not ready . She deserves more than you on the fence . Even if going to her would pull her back in for a short while . She was honest with you , and I assume you were honest back . ”
98723	98729	98730	98730	Eli	103	“ That was the problem , ”
98733	98743	98744	98744	Reese	104	“ Then maybe it was never meant to be . ”

The loss of your mother makes it more frightening to put ourselves on the line , our hearts on the line . Knowing that love could be snatched from you at any moment is a terrifying reality . For years , I closed myself off from the possibility of love . I was protecting my family — or so I thought . In reality , I believe I was protecting myself . But once you find the woman who challenges you , the one who is willing to stick around even though you ’re a caveman … ”

Or maybe I would be living on Key West , picking up aluminum cans and muttering to myself . You boys gave me a reason to go on . Family does that . Women do that . ”

113019	113027	113028	113028	he	2408	“ My hotel , Ms. Van Heusen , ”
113110	113140	113141	113141	she	116	“ No matter who owns the building , you have to know that robbing the Van Heusen of its style will make it just another whitewashed , dull hotel , ”
113229	113236	113223	113223	her	116	“ Surely there ’s another way . ”
113249	113262	113245	113245	he	104	“ Your parents have been in the red for nearly two years . ”
113273	113282	113283	113283	he	104	“ I gather this is news to you , ”
113289	113301	113283	113283	he	104	“ Your father ’s hospital bills put them further in debt . ”
113339	113352	113353	113353	Reese	104	“ They came to us to buy the building and we did , ”
113356	113382	113353	113353	Reese	104	“ I could have fired them , but I did n’t . I offered a generous pension plan if they stayed on through the remodel . ”
113397	113408	113353	113353	Reese	104	“ I take it you did n’t know that either . ”
113409	113418	113419	113419	she	116	“ They did n’t want to worry me , ”
113484	113495	113496	113496	she	116	“ They trusted your father to take care of them , ”
113504	113514	113496	113496	she	116	“ Then you waltz in and wipe them out . ”
113515	113533	113534	113534	Satan	268	“ My father likes your parents , but this is n’t about what nice people they are , ”
113537	113555	113534	113534	Satan	268	“ He mentioned how well they ’d maintained the local landmark with what funds they had available . ”
113602	113610	113611	113611	she	116	“ Your father is a wise man , ”
113636	113660	113611	113611	she	116	“ I doubt his intention when he purchased the Van Heusen was to turn it into a mini - me of the Crane . ”
113661	113687	113688	113688	Reese	104	“ My father is retiring in a few months . He ’s made it clear the future of the Van Heusen is in my hands . ”
113702	113728	113693	113693	him	104	“ I fail to see the charm in the funky , run - down boutique hotel , and I assume most visitors do as well . ”
113742	113756	113757	113757	she	116	“ Do you know how many Hollywood actors have dined in our restaurant ? ”
113760	113776	113757	113757	she	116	“ Hemingway wrote part of his memoir sitting on the velvet chair in the lobby ! ”
113777	113787	113799	113799	his	104	“ I thought he mostly wrote in Key West . ”
113788	113791	113792	113792	she	116	“ Rumors , ”
113834	113842	113843	113843	he	104	“ You have outdated heating and air , ”
113846	113882	113843	113843	he	104	“ elevators that are so close to violating safety codes , you may as well install ladders for the guests on the upper floors , and the wood putty is n’t fooling anyone , Merina . ”
113943	113952	113931	113931	She	116	“ The elevators are original to the building . ”
113953	113957	113958	113958	He	104	“ It shows . ”
113964	114005	113958	113958	He	104	“ The Van Heusen is stodgy and outdated , and revenue is falling more each quarter . I ’m doing your parents a favor by offering them a way out of what will be nothing but a future of headaches . ”
114049	114092	114093	114093	He	104	“ The Crane branding is strong , our business plan seamless . If you love the building as much as you claim to , you ’d support the efforts to increase the traffic . We ’ll see profits double with an upgrade . ”
114098	114112	114095	114095	his	104	“ But not with your parents there . And not with you there . ”
114139	114146	114136	114136	he	104	“ You’re … firing … me ? ”
114152	114165	114147	114147	He	104	“ My family ’s goddamn name is on the marquee , Crane ! ”
114200	114211	114212	114212	he	104	“ Your family ’s name will remain on the building , ”
114241	114268	114238	114238	he	104	“ Your parents are getting close to retirement age . Are you sure you swam over here on their behalf ? Or is this about you ? ”
114269	114276	114277	114277	she	2426	“ Of course I ’m sure , ”
114352	114383	114384	114384	Reese	104	“ Think about it , Merina . What I ’m offering is more than retirement , and at their age I ’m sure they do n’t want to find work , ”
114387	114398	114384	114384	Reese	104	“ Running the Van Heusen is all they ’ve known . ”
114521	114533	114518	114518	Bobbie	113	“ Ms. Van Heusen ’s town car is here , sir . ”
114534	114541	114542	114542	Merina	116	“ I do n’t want it , ”
114569	114572	114552	114552	He	104	“ Very well ”
114642	114661	114662	114662	Reese	104	“ I have an appointment I ca n’t miss , but I wo n’t leave you in suspense . ”
114713	114716	114717	114717	she	116	“ Suspense ? ”
114750	114766	114741	114741	he	104	“ I ’m not going to put you out on your fantastic ass , Merina . ”
114906	114919	114887	114887	he	104	“ I appreciate your reconsidering . I belong at the Van Heusen . ”
114951	114965	114966	114966	he	104	“ No , you misunderstand me . I ca n’t keep you there , ”
114977	115021	115022	115022	He	104	“ But I can offer you almost any position you ’d like at Crane Hotels . We have openings in Wisconsin , Virginia , and Ohio . I know it ’s not Chicago , but chances are you can stay in the Midwest . ”
115177	115188	115195	115195	she	116	“ You listen to me , you suited sewer rat . ”
115201	115239	115195	115195	she	116	“ I ’m going to find a way around your machinations and when I do , I ’m going to march back in here with the contract my parents signed and shove it straight up your ass . ”
115276	115298	115257	115257	he	104	“ You ’ll have to forgive Ms. Van Heusen . She does n’t like when she does n’t get her way . ”
115318	115325	115311	115311	Reese	104	“ Will there be anything else ? ”
115326	115333	115313	115313	his	104	“ Your head on a pike . ”
