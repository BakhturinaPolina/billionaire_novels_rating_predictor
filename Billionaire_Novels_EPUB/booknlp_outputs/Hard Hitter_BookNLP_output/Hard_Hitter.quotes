5517	5532	5514	5514	Hartley	107	“ What do they put up there when you lose ? A middle finger ? ”
5533	5536	5537	5537	Trevi	110	“ Nope . ”
5542	5569	5539	5539	his	110	“ It ’s just a void where the star should be . And it ’s weird , but I kind of hate knowing it ’s missing . ”
5570	5578	5579	5579	Georgia	104	“ Then the mind games are working , ”
5582	5589	5579	5579	Georgia	104	“ The man is a genius . ”
5641	5653	5633	5633	her	204	“ Mr. O’Doul , how is your pain level this evening ? ”

5766	5769	5770	5770	he	97	“ Right , ”
5773	5793	5770	5770	he	97	“ Send Rebecca some appointment times . She ’ll put ’em on my calendar and I ’ll be there . ”
5840	5850	5851	5851	she	449	“ Did you take anything for the pain tonight ? ”

5922	5929	5916	5916	he	97	“ How ’s your ankle healing ? ”

5971	5986	5965	5965	She	449	“ By being stupid . Tripped on a set of steps in my apartment . ”
5987	5990	5995	5995	her	449	“ Ouch . ”
6029	6042	6022	6022	he	97	“ Did you fall all the way down a flight of stairs ? ”
6043	6064	6065	6065	She	449	“ Nope . And I installed a night - light in the hallway , so it wo n’t happen again . ”
6070	6081	6065	6065	She	449	“ Georgia , how are the wedding plans coming along ? ”
6082	6125	6022	6022	he	97	“ Okay , I guess ? Ask Rebecca . She ’s the one who ’s keeping track . She wants me to pick out flowers this week , except she gets mad when I just point to the first thing we see . ”
6126	6129	6130	6130	Leo	110	“ Flowers ? ”
6138	6147	6130	6130	Leo	110	“ How could those be a big decision ? ”
6148	6151	6152	6152	Georgia	104	“ Right ? ”
6155	6177	6152	6152	Georgia	104	“ Do n’t worry your pretty head over it . You just focus on hockey and stay in your happy place . ”
6178	6189	6190	6190	Leo	110	“ Did I mention how much I love this woman ? ”
6199	6221	6222	6222	He	110	“ She does n’t care that I do n’t care about flowers ! Am I winning at life , or what ? ”
6228	6234	6235	6235	Georgia	104	“ You are , honey , ”
6238	6262	6235	6235	Georgia	104	“ Carry on with your important discussion about hiding each other ’s jock straps or whatever . Ari and I have got this . ”
6298	6315	6316	6316	Hartley	107	“ How ’s Callihan ? When is she going to move to Boston and marry you ? ”
6319	6330	6316	6316	Hartley	107	“ What are you , a marriage evangelist , now ? ”
6331	6335	6336	6336	Trevi	110	“ Born again , ”
6339	6350	6351	6351	Hartley	107	“ I ’ve played on three teams in three years , ”
6354	6417	6351	6351	Hartley	107	“ I ca n’t wait to shack up with Callihan , but we ’re waiting until it looks like I might be able to stay put somewhere for more than a season . She ’s got a great job in Chicago , too . Another year there will only make it easier for her to find a job in Boston or wherever . ”
6418	6427	6431	6431	his	452	“ Uh - huh . Sounds like stalling . ”
6438	6446	6431	6431	his	452	“ Let ’s sober - dial her . ”
6447	6452	6453	6453	Georgia	104	“ What is that ? ”

6474	6477	6471	6471	Hartley	107	“ Obvs . ”
6478	6481	6482	6482	Trevi	110	“ Obvs , ”
6509	6518	6498	6498	Trevi	110	“ I miss the hell out of you ! ”
6534	6537	6498	6498	Trevi	110	“ Hello ? ”
6548	6565	6498	6498	Trevi	110	“ Omigod ! Look who it is ! Trevi — I want to meet your girlfriend ! ”
6618	6628	6629	6629	he	110	“ I think it ’s time to turn in , ”
6634	6641	6642	6642	she	204	“ You take care of yourself , ”
6650	6655	6642	6642	she	204	“ Good work tonight . ”
6674	6678	6679	6679	he	110	“ Thank you , ”

7521	7525	7526	7526	he	97	“ Got it , ”
7820	7825	7812	7812	She	204	“ C’m on in , ”
7861	7863	7850	7850	She	204	“ Daughter ”
7879	7883	7884	7884	he	97	“ Pearl Jam ? ”
7890	7897	7898	7898	she	204	“ You do n’t like it ? ”
7927	7934	7935	7935	he	97	“ No , I love it , ”
7938	7962	7935	7935	he	97	“ Once I tried to get a massage at a hotel , and they were playing harp music . My ears were bleeding . ”
7963	7972	7973	7973	Ari	204	“ Okay , no harps . Got it . ”
8071	8078	8057	8057	He	97	“ How long does this take ? ”
8086	8103	8057	8057	He	97	“ Sixty minutes , usually . And I have n’t killed anyone yet . I swear . ”
8104	8109	8110	8110	His	97	“ Okay . Sorry . ”
8145	8196	8197	8197	She	204	“ I ’m going to ease toward your hip flexor strain , okay ? I ’ll want to relax the surrounding muscles , so they do n’t contribute to your pain . You ’ll let me know if anything hurts , and if you do n’t approve of the pressure . ”
8258	8270	8243	8243	her	204	“ Just checking in , here . How ’s the pressure ? ”
8271	8274	8275	8275	he	97	“ Okay , ”
8408	8411	8412	8412	she	204	“ Patrick , ”
8422	8439	8412	8412	she	204	“ Are you in pain ? Massage does n’t have to hurt to do you good . ”
8440	8444	8445	8445	he	97	“ No pain , ”
8451	8463	8445	8445	he	97	“ You ’re fighting me , though . Why is that ? ”
8464	8467	8468	8468	he	97	“ Uh , ”
8483	8503	8468	8468	he	97	“ That ’s the . . . trouble spot , right ? Why would I want someone touching it ? ”
8514	8519	8507	8507	his	97	“ Well . . . ”
8538	8580	8581	8581	He	97	“ Because I can help you ? I wo n’t hurt you , I promise . Careful massage can reduce inflammation , and relax surrounding muscles , too . Is it possible that you had a bad experience with massage before ? ”
8596	8611	8581	8581	He	97	“ Nah . I just do n’t like having , uh , weak spots . ”
8612	8620	8644	8644	she	204	“ Everyone does , though , right ? ”
8621	8632	8633	8633	She	204	“ I suppose . But I do n’t grab yours . ”
8679	8682	8683	8683	she	204	“ Hey , ”
8686	8712	8683	8683	she	204	“ You told me a few minutes ago that you ’d tried to get a massage at a hotel once . What happened that time ? ”
8713	8719	8720	8720	He	97	“ Did n’t work out . ”
8727	8736	8720	8720	He	97	“ It ’s not you , I swear . ”
8737	8756	8757	8757	He	97	“ Why did n’t it work out ? Besides the harps . Why did you book a massage ? ”
8768	8811	8757	8757	He	97	“ I ’d slept funny on the jet , and my neck hurt . No big deal . So I booked a massage at the spa . Left after ten minutes . I guess I just do n’t like hands on me . ”
8812	8821	8822	8822	He	97	“ You do n’t like to be touched . ”
8828	8838	8822	8822	He	97	“ It is n’t my favorite thing , no . ”
8872	8877	8878	8878	she	204	“ Everybody ’s different , ”
8882	8903	8878	8878	she	204	“ But we still have to work on your hip flexors . I have one idea that might help you . ”
8904	8907	8908	8908	He	97	“ Good . ”
8914	8921	8908	8908	He	97	“ Because I ’m fresh out . ”
8952	8988	8989	8989	He	97	“ Let ’s try a more active technique . It will feel more like a gym exercise and less like massage . Can you roll onto your good side and bend your knee for me ? ”
9019	9029	9012	9012	her	204	“ Bend this knee a little more for me . ”
9033	9049	9050	9050	She	204	“ All right . I ’m going to brace your outer hip . Like this . ”
9069	9087	9088	9088	He	97	“ And you ’re going to put your own hand on the trouble spot . Show me . ”
9102	9111	9112	9112	She	204	“ Now , do n’t use your back . ”
9121	9144	9112	9112	She	204	“ Do n’t activate these . Instead , use your hip and leg . Press down and straighten that leg . Go . ”
9162	9170	9171	9171	She	204	“ Good ! How ’d that feel ? ”
9193	9198	9173	9173	her	204	“ Not too bad . ”
9199	9211	9212	9212	He	97	“ You would n’t lie to me , captain , right ? ”
9219	9224	9212	9212	He	97	“ No , ma’am . ”
9225	9249	9250	9250	She	204	“ Ugh . You ma’amed me like an old woman . Just for that you ’re going to do it four more times . ”
9256	9259	9250	9250	She	204	“ Bend . ”
9260	9265	9212	9212	He	97	“ Yes , ma’am . ”
9266	9273	9212	9212	He	97	“ For that ? Six times . ”
9274	9279	9280	9280	She	204	“ Yes , master . ”
9333	9339	9344	9344	he	97	“ Ready , big guy ? ”
9340	9343	9344	9344	he	97	“ Ready , ”
9347	9352	9344	9344	he	97	“ Push and go . ”
9377	9380	9369	9369	he	97	“ Okay ? ”
9381	9397	9398	9398	Ari	204	“ Yeah . It feels a little looser than it did a half hour ago . ”
9424	9431	9432	9432	she	204	“ Now roll onto your stomach , ”
9435	9456	9432	9432	she	204	“ For fifteen minutes I want you to pretend you enjoy massage . Just to stroke my ego , okay ? ”
9501	9507	9508	9508	she	204	“ How am I doing ? ”
9511	9517	9508	9508	she	204	“ Feel free to lie . ”
9518	9532	9533	9533	She	204	“ Aw . This is the best massage I ’ve had all year . ”
9540	9549	9533	9533	She	204	“ This is the only one , right ? ”
9550	9556	9557	9557	He	97	“ Yeah , but still . ”
9596	9621	9576	9576	she	204	“ Do you have much pain here ? The risk with a hip strain is that you ’ll overcompensate by using your lower back . ”
9622	9638	9576	9576	she	204	“ By the end of a game , I ’m feeling it there for sure . ”
9654	9748	9645	9645	She	204	“ Okay . At your next visit , we ’ll keep working on these trouble spots . Each time you put on a burst of speed on the ice , you demand a lot from these muscles . If we keep you loose , it ’s going to help . I ’m going to work into your hip a little now — but only from the back . And I ’m not going to hurt you . And you ’re lying on the trouble spot , right ? No one can touch it . ”
9764	9772	9749	9749	She	204	“ Got it . Do your worst . ”
9829	9831	9826	9827	Eddie Vedder	123	“ Black ”
10056	10059	10060	10060	he	97	“ Okay , ”
10066	10069	10060	10060	he	97	“ Thanks . ”
10070	10073	10074	10074	she	204	“ Here , ”
10087	10100	10101	10101	She	204	“ You do n’t want to get massage oil on your clothes . ”
10134	10141	10142	10142	she	204	“ See you tomorrow in Detroit , ”
10148	10165	10142	10142	she	204	“ I ’ll text you a location . I think we ’ll be at the hotel . ”
10166	10175	10176	10176	he	97	“ Right . I ’ll be on time , ”
10179	10182	10142	10142	she	204	“ Thanks . ”
10183	10187	10189	10189	he	97	“ Be well ! ”
11340	11351	11352	11352	she	204	“ I should n’t have to prove it , Vince , ”
11357	11381	11352	11352	she	204	“ If you think I ’m a cheat , then leave me already ! Walk out the fucking door ! Just stop this ! ”
11529	11536	11537	11537	he	125	“ I ’m sorry , baby , ”
11540	11548	11537	11537	he	125	“ Terrible accident . Never happen again . ”
11636	11645	11646	11646	she	204	“ He did this , did n’t he ? ”
11660	11677	11646	11646	she	204	“ I never liked the look of him . Good for you showing him the door . ”
11790	11799	11800	11800	Maddy	128	“ You ’d do the same for me , ”
11845	11860	11833	11833	he	125	“ I can take care of myself , hon . You do the same . ”
11897	11909	11885	11885	he	125	“ Fucking cunt ! Get down here and let me in . ”
11923	11949	11910	11910	Maddy	128	“ Go away or I ’m calling the police . You have ten seconds . Tomorrow Ari will tell you how to get your stuff . ”
11950	11954	11955	11955	he	125	“ Meddling bitch ! ”
13090	13096	13097	13097	Becca	119	“ How ’s O’Doul today ? ”
13111	13125	13097	13097	Becca	119	“ I heard rumors that they sent him to you for his hip . ”
13126	13131	13132	13132	Ari	204	“ He seemed fair , ”
13139	13168	13132	13132	Ari	204	“ A little rest would probably help him . But I do n’t think it ’s any worse than a lot of the strains the guys play on . ”
13236	13292	13223	13223	you	623	“ Is Doulie a diva in the treatment room ? He ’s so freaking bossy . The travel team actually calls all the hotels where he stays and gets duplicate receipts to submit for him , because they ’ve learned it ’s a bigger pain to ask for his cooperation than to just take over . ”
13293	13296	13297	13297	Ari	204	“ Really ? ”
13300	13308	13297	13297	Ari	204	“ Sounds like he has them trained . ”
13345	13375	13330	13330	Ari	204	“ He has an ego the size of the stadium . If you have any trouble with him , I ’m happy to play the part of bad cop . ”
13376	13383	13384	13384	Ari	204	“ You do that part well . ”
13391	13394	13384	13384	Ari	204	“ Fuck , ”
13398	13415	13395	13395	Becca	119	“ Do that again . Please ? I spent too many hours at my desk today . ”
13441	13450	13451	13451	she	204	“ You only like me for my hands , ”
13454	13475	13451	13451	she	204	“ Not true ! You make a mean margarita , and you always turn in your personnel forms on time . ”
13476	13484	13485	13485	She	204	“ I feel so much better now . ”
13646	13650	13651	13651	Becca	119	“ Marry me , ”
13659	13678	13651	13651	Becca	119	“ I would , but I ’ve sworn off relationships . Today was a good reminder of why . ”
13688	13704	13679	13679	Becca	119	“ Oh , no ! What happened ? Did he pound on your door again ? ”
13705	13723	13740	13740	He	101	“ No , but his stuff is still in my basement storage room , and . . . ”

13834	13839	13840	13840	Nate	101	“ Evening , ladies , ”
14002	14017	13989	13989	Becca	119	“ Hi , Lauren ! Want to have a glass of wine with us ? ”
14094	14100	14101	14101	Becca	119	“ I ’m always nice , ”
14107	14116	14101	14101	Becca	119	“ but I ’m really not sure why . ”
14117	14126	14127	14127	Ari	204	“ Because it feels better to be nice , ”
14130	14138	14127	14127	Ari	204	“ And you ’re a beautiful person . ”
14146	14154	14139	14139	Becca	119	“ She makes ugly look pretty good . ”
14213	14216	14217	14217	Nate	101	“ Rebecca , ”
14220	14231	14217	14217	Nate	101	“ Do you happen to have tonight ’s ticket sales ? ”
14232	14237	14238	14238	she	132	“ But of course ! ”
14241	14262	14263	14263	She	132	“ Do you really think I ’d stand here and slurp wine if I had n’t brought them with me ? ”
14279	14287	14263	14263	She	132	“ It ’s here somewhere . Ah . ”
14307	14320	14299	14299	Nate	101	“ Anything shocking in here ? Should I hit the whiskey early ? ”
14321	14339	14340	14340	Nate	101	“ It ’s always cocktail hour somewhere , boss . But the numbers looked good to me . ”
14359	14373	14351	14351	Lauren	132	“ These are good numbers . And I like the time series graph . ”
14374	14391	14393	14393	he	101	“ Thanks ! I got sick of flipping backward to see the prior weeks ’ numbers . ”
14423	14427	14428	14428	Nate	101	“ Thank you , ”
14436	14446	14447	14447	Lauren	132	“ That ’s all for today , I suppose . ”
14461	14470	14471	14471	Becca	119	“ Are n’t you staying for the game ? ”
14474	14479	14480	14480	Lauren	132	“ I hate hockey , ”
14569	14577	14578	14578	Nathan	101	“ How ’d the press take it ? ”
14586	14591	14592	14592	Georgia	104	“ Lots of questions , ”
14595	14603	14592	14592	Georgia	104	“ There ’s going to be speculation . ”
14604	14608	14609	14609	Becca	119	“ Take what ? ”
14623	14632	14633	14633	Tom	134	“ O’Doul was scratched at the last minute , ”
14636	14654	14633	14633	Tom	134	“ The trainers want him rested . That ’s our story and we ’re sticking to it . ”
14805	14812	14813	14814	Coach Worthington	135	“ We need to rest you , ”
14818	14837	14813	14814	Coach Worthington	135	“ I need you to play a long postseason . Ca n’t do that if you ’re injured . ”
14925	14935	14936	14936	Coach	670	“ We got an overtime point out of it , ”
15081	15087	15088	15088	he	97	“ Whoa ! Sorry ma’am , ”
15112	15118	15094	15094	She	678	“ Twenty bucks , man , ”
15122	15126	15094	15094	She	678	“ Pay up . ”
15127	15132	15133	15134	the goalie	680	“ What ? Why ? ”
15137	15147	15148	15148	O’Doul	97	“ For almost mowing down that kid . Jimbo ? ”
15162	15168	15148	15148	O’Doul	97	“ Sully owes you twenty . ”
15169	15173	15174	15174	Jimbo	138	“ Got it , ”
15193	15197	15186	15187	The team	292	“ parking tickets , ”
15259	15268	15269	15269	Trevi	110	“ Want to get some barbecue for lunch ? ”
15273	15286	15269	15269	Trevi	110	“ The Katt Phone says there ’s a good ribs joint nearby . ”
15287	15292	15293	15293	Castro	109	“ I ’m in , ”
15296	15300	15301	15301	O’Doul	97	“ I wish , ”
15304	15313	15314	15314	Castro	109	“ I have to get a fucking massage . ”
15321	15330	15331	15331	Castro	109	“ And the problem is . . . ? ”
15334	15337	15331	15331	Castro	109	“ Eh , ”
15350	15360	15347	15347	his	97	“ Not my favorite way to spend an hour . ”
15361	15367	15368	15368	Trevi	110	“ I ’ll take it ! ”
15371	15391	15392	15392	He	110	“ I like it when Ari does that thing to the base of my skull . With her thumbs ? ”
15405	15411	15412	15412	Castro	109	“ Aw , hell yes , ”
15415	15440	15412	15412	Castro	109	“ And when she does my feet , I always propose . How many marriage proposals do you think she gets in a week ? ”
15441	15446	15447	15447	Trevi	110	“ Let ’s see , ”
15458	15479	15447	15447	Trevi	110	“ She works six days a week during the high season , six massages a day . So probably thirty . ”
15480	15491	15492	15492	Castro	109	“ Six times six is thirty - six , moron , ”
15500	15504	15505	15505	He	110	“ No kidding ? ”
15512	15534	15505	15505	He	110	“ I passed the third grade , too . But not everyone proposes . I would n’t do that to Georgia . ”
15535	15540	15541	15541	Castro	109	“ I propose twice , ”
15544	15550	15541	15541	Castro	109	“ Once for each foot . ”
15551	15560	15561	15561	O’Doul	97	“ Oh , shut it , will you ? ”
15573	15581	15582	15582	Trevi	110	“ Come back in a better mood ! ”
15744	15753	15754	15754	Ari	204	“ That ’s why I called a locksmith , ”
15760	15780	15781	15781	She	692	“ It ’s not that complicated . Remove the lock that ’s there , and install a different one . ”
15784	15822	15823	15823	She	692	“ Well , the deed is n’t in my name . But last time I used your services I did n’t need it . Could I please speak to the manager ? Yes , I ’ll hold . ”
15829	15843	15844	15844	Busted	117	“ You can change in the bathroom if that makes you more comfortable . ”
15865	15905	15906	15906	She	692	“ Please look up my account . I ’ve used you for years . The lock on the basement door is . . . What ? You installed it ? Seriously ? No , I did n’t authorize it ! ”
15911	15922	15906	15906	She	692	“ He lied , okay ? Men do that sometimes . ”
15971	15999	16003	16003	she	692	“ Just remove the lock and give me another one . I did n’t authorize it . And he is no longer a resident at that address . ”
16039	16043	16044	16044	he	97	“ Everything okay ? ”
16058	16063	16064	16064	She	204	“ Fine . Thanks . ”
16141	16144	16145	16145	She	692	“ Shit . ”
16203	16206	16207	16207	she	692	“ Sorry , ”
16210	16225	16207	16207	she	692	“ But that was excellent comedy , and I needed a laugh right now . ”
16231	16244	16226	16226	He	97	“ Thank you very much , I ’ll be here all week . ”
16269	16281	16282	16282	She	204	“ Just let me put a sheet down on the table . ”
16348	16352	16338	16338	She	204	“ Thank you . ”
16353	16357	16359	16359	she	204	“ No problem . ”
16403	16410	16411	16411	she	204	“ Want to pick a playlist ? ”
16421	16429	16411	16411	she	204	“ I liked what you played before . ”
16456	16477	16443	16443	he	97	“ I ’m sorry you were scratched from last night ’s game . Was n’t my idea , I promise . ”
16478	16481	16491	16491	her	204	“ Okay . ”
16493	16497	16498	16498	She	204	“ It happens . ”
16506	16513	16500	16500	her	204	“ You say that so convincingly . ”
16514	16519	16522	16522	himself	97	“ Do n’t I ? ”
16531	16578	16526	16526	Ari	204	“ I ’m going to try to warm you up for a few minutes . After that we ’ll go back to the same active release technique as last time , because I think it was starting to work for you . How does that sound ? ”
16579	16582	16583	16583	he	97	“ Fine , ”
16852	16860	16861	16861	she	204	“ You ’re fighting me , Patrick , ”
16877	16880	16861	16861	she	204	“ Sorry . ”
16911	16925	16889	16889	she	204	“ I know this is n’t your favorite thing . I get it . ”
16946	16956	16943	16943	her	204	“ You must think I ’m a total nutbar . ”
16957	16962	16963	16963	she	204	“ Not at all , ”
16967	16996	16963	16963	she	204	“ I could give you a sermon about how I ’m a professional and this is just business , yada yada yada . But that would be bullshit . ”
16997	17001	17002	17002	He	97	“ It would ? ”
17018	17025	17014	17014	she	204	“ You ’re not a professional ? ”
17031	17086	17026	17026	She	204	“ Of course I am . But when you walk into this room , you do n’t just bring your muscles and your bones . You bring your whole history as a human being . You bring your soul . And when someone touches you , they ’re touching all of that , too . ”
17087	17092	17028	17028	her	204	“ Okay . . . ”
17102	17114	17115	17115	She	204	“ Did you ever stop and wonder why we shake hands ? ”
17127	17140	17115	17115	She	204	“ It ’s a cultural thing . But do you know why ? ”
17141	17155	17161	17161	she	204	“ Ca n’t say I did very well in social studies in school , ”
17170	17241	17167	17167	She	204	“ I have n’t the faintest idea where the tradition came from . But I have a theory . We touch someone we meet because it establishes trust . Maybe it ’s only a tiny little bit of trust . But if I shake your hand , I have to get close to your body . There ’s a brief exchange of heat and sensation . Give me your hand . ”
17276	17309	17310	17310	She	204	“ See — this is just a small extension of trust . But when you ’re on my table , the trust you extend to me is a lot greater than that . ”
17362	17431	17353	17353	she	204	“ Patrick , people have all kinds of reactions to massage . I think you ’d be surprised . Some guys get chatty and tell me a hell of a lot more than they would if my hands were n’t all over their naked bodies . Some guys fall asleep right away . This is all completely normal . Some people even start crying when I touch them . ”
17438	17447	17353	17353	she	204	“ Seriously ? Do I know these people ? ”
17454	17482	17450	17450	her	204	“ I would n’t tell you that . Never . Just like I would n’t tell another soul what reaction you have to being on my table . ”
17483	17486	17450	17450	her	204	“ Sorry . ”
17493	17497	17498	17498	She	204	“ I know . ”
17503	17549	17498	17498	She	204	“ I ’m not giving up on you . But any ideas you have for making this easier on you , I ’m all ears . I do n’t know if you ’re a fan of meditation , but that ’s something we could try . ”
17550	17553	17554	17554	She	204	“ Eh . ”
17557	17578	17579	17579	She	204	“ Fine . Lie back now . And tell me this — where and when do you feel most relaxed ? ”
17622	17634	17612	17612	He	97	“ At home . In my bed . Just like anyone . ”
17701	17706	17692	17693	the salesperson	721	“ perfect for entertaining . ”
17782	17797	17762	17762	Ari	204	“ When I need a really relaxing thought , I think about the beach . ”
17798	17802	17803	17803	he	97	“ Which beach ? ”
17835	17839	17840	17840	She	204	“ Any beach . ”
17843	17918	17840	17840	She	204	“ But , okay , not Coney Island , because it ’s crowded . When I was a little girl my grandmother had a place on Fire Island , and I used to stay the whole summer there with her because school was out and Mom was at work . I like the way things sound at the beach . Like they ’re farther away . And the surf has a nice even rhythm . ”
17927	17939	17840	17840	She	204	“ Yeah , I never spent much time on a beach . ”
17940	17950	18022	18022	she	730	“ What do you do during the off season ? ”
17963	17972	18022	18022	she	730	“ Last year I went golfing with Beringer . ”
17973	17978	18022	18022	she	730	“ You like golf ? ”
17979	17982	17983	17983	he	97	“ No , ”
17990	18012	17987	17987	she	730	“ But it was on my bucket list , I guess . To see why all the rich guys liked it . ”
18013	18021	18022	18022	she	730	“ Are n’t you a rich guy ? ”
18025	18050	18022	18022	she	730	“ On paper . But where I grew up , nobody golfed . There was hockey and football . Even baseball was for pussies . ”
18080	18091	18075	18075	She	731	“ Where ’d you grow up ? Wait — Minnesota ? ”
18092	18103	18070	18071	The woman	731	“ That ’s right . But not the nice part . ”
18115	18120	18075	18075	She	731	“ How about you ? ”
18121	18163	18164	18164	She	731	“ Brooklyn . I grew up on Court Street , about two miles away from where I live now . I ’m an Italian girl who teaches yoga in Brooklyn . I ’ve got all the clichés working together at once . ”
18169	18193	18164	18164	She	731	“ Roll on your side for me . Let ’s do this thing . Can you handle it ? How ’s your pain ? ”
18194	18202	18075	18075	She	731	“ I ’m looser today than yesterday . ”
18206	18218	18075	18075	She	731	“ Maybe that night off was n’t such a bad plan ? ”
18219	18231	18232	18232	She	731	“ What — you sure you do n’t want the credit ? ”
18243	18278	18232	18232	She	731	“ I never take credit . My job is to help you get out of your own way and then hog the limelight . Bend your knee . Are you working this muscle today ? ”
18286	18295	18279	18279	She	731	“ Or am I allowed to do it ? ”
18296	18312	18320	18320	she	731	“ I would n’t want to put you out of a job . Go ahead . ”
18348	18390	18391	18391	She	731	“ Put your palm down on the table . I want you as stable as possible . Remember — don’t use your back . We want a gentle extension , so if anything hurts , do n’t push it . Ready ? ”
18403	18406	18407	18407	He	97	“ Extend . ”
18460	18463	18464	18464	she	731	“ Good ! ”
18471	18507	18508	18508	He	97	“ Let ’s leave it there for now . Roll onto your stomach if you would n’t mind . I ’m going to work on your lower back and ask you a few more questions . ”
18535	18548	18549	18549	she	731	“ Your goal is to avoid overcompensating with your back and quads , ”
18559	18580	18581	18581	She	731	“ The nerves attached to your hip flexors stretch down your leg and around to your lumbar spine . Here . ”
18601	18614	18581	18581	She	731	“ So when you skate the warm - up tomorrow . . . ”
18615	18628	18629	18629	She	731	“ . . . If I skate the warm - up tomorrow . ”
18634	18682	18629	18629	She	731	“ Let ’s be optimistic , big guy . When you skate the warm - up , I want you to think about keeping the form of your stride all night long . When you ’re tired , do n’t change your stance to activate your back . ”
18683	18689	18690	18690	He	97	“ I can do that . ”
18708	18742	18743	18743	Ari	204	“ The fight is the hairy part . But if I can knock that out in the first period , it ’s easier to keep things stable for the rest of the game . ”
18756	18773	18774	18774	He	97	“ Can I ask you something ? And I do n’t mean this to sound judgmental . ”
18777	18790	18774	18774	He	97	“ That ’s what people say right before they say something judgmental . ”
18804	18841	18791	18791	She	204	“ That is sometimes true . But I never saw a hockey game until I applied for this job . And I want you to explain the fighting to me . Why do you do it ? ”
18864	18898	18854	18854	He	97	“ There ’s a code . Most of the time when I fight , it ’s because someone broke that code or someone needs a refresher . I fight to protect my guys . ”
18925	18928	18929	18929	she	204	“ Okay , ”
18933	18940	18929	18929	she	204	“ But then who protects you ? ”
18965	18974	18976	18976	she	204	“ I guess I do . I dunno . ”
19193	19205	19206	19206	she	204	“ If you turn over I can work on your quads , ”
19233	19239	19240	19240	he	97	“ I have to run , ”
19243	19258	19240	19240	he	97	“ I appreciate it , but there are some calls I need to return . ”
19272	19284	19259	19259	Ari	204	“ And here I thought we were getting along so well . ”
19285	19289	19240	19240	he	97	“ We are . ”
19293	19304	19240	19240	he	97	“ Really . I ’ll show up tomorrow and everything . ”
19305	19309	19310	19310	He	97	“ Good man . ”
19321	19348	19315	19315	her	204	“ Let me wash my hands and then the bathroom and shower are all yours . You do n’t want massage oil all over your clothes . ”
19384	19390	19391	19391	she	204	“ Take care of yourself , ”
19660	19665	19666	19669	the fan beside Ari	745	“ Aw , hell , ”
19675	19692	19693	19693	Ari	204	“ Crazy rookie was looking for a fight right there . That ’s what that was . ”
19900	19904	19894	19894	Someone	142	song—“No Sleep Till Brooklyn ”
20020	20025	20026	20026	Ari	204	“ Is he okay ? ”
20044	20065	20036	20037	The trainer	764	“ Sure . He just gets like this some nights . Kinda withdrawn . He likes to be left alone . ”
20091	20096	20075	20075	She	204	“ How are you ? ”
20104	20107	20097	20097	He	97	“ Fine . ”
20114	20118	20119	20119	He	97	“ What hurts ? ”
20145	20150	20151	20151	He	97	“ Are you injured ? ”
20156	20167	20153	20153	his	97	“ No . But I broke that kid ’s jaw . ”
20173	20181	20168	20168	She	204	“ Really ? How do you know ? ”
20182	20187	20188	20188	His	97	“ Felt the pop . ”
20193	20197	20198	20198	she	204	“ Come here , ”
20206	20217	20198	20198	she	204	“ I want to get a look at your hip . ”
20218	20223	20224	20224	he	97	“ It ’s fine , ”
20317	20324	20325	20325	she	204	“ Tell me about the fight , ”
20333	20338	20339	20339	he	97	“ It was stupid , ”
20342	20389	20339	20339	he	97	“ I told the kid he ’d been a dick , and that his enforcer had better come out and answer for that bullshit on Castro . But he says , I ’ll fight you myself . I told him that sounded like a stupid idea . ”
20390	20398	20399	20399	She	204	“ And . . . it was ? ”
20413	20424	20399	20399	She	204	“ I spent hours watching their enforcer ’s fight tapes . ”
20430	20436	20399	20399	She	204	“ We all do that . ”
20437	20441	20442	20442	she	204	“ Of course , ”
20485	20511	20478	20478	his	97	“ But this kid wanted to do it himself . And now he ’s gon na be having lunch through a straw for a month . ”
20538	20543	20544	20544	she	204	“ I ’m sorry , ”
20548	20555	20556	20556	he	97	“ It ’s not my break , ”
20683	20700	20669	20669	She	204	“ How is this tonight ? The same as after your last game ? Or different ? ”
20709	20714	20715	20715	he	97	“ Not as bad , ”
20719	20730	20715	20715	he	97	“ Well . There ’s a shred of good news . ”

20884	20898	20879	20879	he	97	“ Does Castro really propose to you every time you touch his feet ? ”
20913	20930	20905	20905	she	204	“ Yes , he does . We could be married a hundred times over by now . ”
20940	20952	20905	20905	she	204	“ God . Tell him to get in line behind me . ”

22598	22616	22576	22576	He	97	“ Pete , does that computer have Google ? I need to know the clubhouse office digits . ”

24754	24758	24759	24759	She	204	“ My bad . ”
24769	24812	24759	24759	She	204	“ God , I ’m so pissed off right now ! My window is broken . And that asshole made me feel unsafe in my own house . And I ca n’t even fix it because we ’re off to Montreal tomorrow . ”
24813	24832	24833	24833	he	97	“ One thing at a time , okay ? There ’s no reason to be afraid right now , ”
24850	24880	24841	24841	She	204	“ He ’ll be back . I had the locks changed on the storage room , because I think he was using it for some kind of dodgy business . ”
24902	24911	24912	24912	She	204	“ Do you want to call the cops ? ”
24915	24926	24912	24912	She	204	“ Maybe ? Do I have to decide right now ? ”
24927	24944	24881	24881	O’Doul	97	“ No . But why would n’t you ? Are you keeping him out of trouble ? ”
24945	25014	25015	25015	She	204	“ He can hang for all I care . But if the cops arrest him , he ’d get out on bail , pissed as hell at me . I ’d rather find a way to just be rid of him . I should n’t have locked him out . That was stupid of me . But I needed a way to motivate him to leave for good ! ”
25031	25035	25023	25023	her	204	“ All right . ”
25044	25061	25023	25023	her	204	“ Let me take a look at your broken window . Can you call the super ? ”
25062	25068	25015	25015	She	204	“ I am the super . ”
25069	25072	25073	25073	He	901	“ Ah . ”
25076	25086	25073	25073	He	901	“ We need a piece of plywood , then . ”
25097	25119	25091	25091	she	204	“ I have one already , because the kids in the neighborhood have broken windows before . With baseballs , though . ”
25141	25148	25149	25149	he	901	“ You ’re not wearing shoes , ”
25153	25159	25149	25149	he	901	“ Let me do this . ”
25170	25182	25162	25162	her	204	“ I ’ll get the broom and some damp paper towels . ”
25230	25245	25224	25224	she	204	“ God , if I replace it , will he just break it again ? ”
25246	25265	25266	25266	he	901	“ It ’s too late to worry about it tonight , anyway . Are you packed for Montreal ? ”
25275	25278	25279	25279	He	901	“ Yes . ”
25284	25310	25279	25279	He	901	“ Let ’s go . You ca n’t stay here tonight . And in twelve hours you ’ll be on the way to the airport . ”
25311	25317	25224	25224	she	204	“ Where are we going ? ”
25321	25344	25351	25351	her	204	“ Anywhere you want . But unless you have a better idea , my place . I ’m just on Water Street . ”
25371	25374	25375	25375	she	204	“ Okay , ”
25378	25391	25375	25375	she	204	“ I . . . God , I ’m such an idiot . ”
25415	25420	25421	25421	he	901	“ Come on now , ”
25425	25434	25421	25421	he	901	“ It ’s going to be all right . ”
25573	25579	25580	25580	O’Doul	97	“ Who lives up there ? ”
25589	25600	25601	25601	she	204	“ Maddy , my tenant . That ’s her entrance , ”
25610	25644	25601	25601	she	204	“ I ’ll e - mail her tonight and give her a heads up . She already knows that Vince is a loose cannon , though . She wo n’t even be surprised . ”
25703	25709	25710	25710	O’Doul	97	“ Vince is your ex ? ”
25714	25720	25710	25710	O’Doul	97	“ Yeah . Long story . ”
25721	25727	25728	25728	Sigh	151	“ I ’ve got time . ”
25730	25769	25728	25728	Sigh	151	“ I threw him out six weeks ago . But we were together for eight years , since I was twenty - one , and a waitress at his club in Manhattan . I was young and stupid . ”
25770	25776	25777	25777	She	204	“ Were n’t we all . ”
25784	25836	25777	25777	She	204	“ In my defense , he used to treat me really well . He was an older , successful man — he ’s thirty - nine now . I was attracted to his confidence . He treated me like a queen for years — until things stopped going well for him . ”
25837	25841	25710	25710	O’Doul	97	“ And then ? ”
25850	25987	25777	25777	She	204	“ He became overextended . When I met him he owned a club and had an interest in another . But over the years he tried to expand his empire , and it was harder than he thought it would be . I think he got into business with some people he should n’t have trusted . I ’m pretty sure they screwed him over . Every year it got a little worse . One of the clubs recently had a bunch of drug busts , and they lost their liquor license . And I think Vince owes a bunch of people money . But to listen to him , it ’s always someone else ’s fault . This past year I tried to ask more questions , and he did n’t like that at all . ”
26013	26027	26004	26006	A uniformed doorman	918	“ Evening , Mr. O’Doul . Will you need a car tomorrow morning ? ”
26028	26044	26004	26006	A uniformed doorman	918	“ Yeah , thanks . Flight leaves at eight . So . . . seven ? ”
26045	26053	26054	26055	The doorman	919	“ I ’ll take care of it . ”
26217	26232	26233	26233	he	97	“ I do n’t usually have people over . So it ’s . . . ”
26236	26242	26233	26233	he	97	“ A messy bachelor pad ? ”
26246	26250	26233	26233	he	97	“ Not exactly . ”
26299	26306	26307	26307	he	97	“ It ’s all one room , ”
26310	26318	26307	26307	he	97	“ But you can have the bed . ”
26319	26328	26329	26329	His	97	“ You do n’t have to do that . ”
26347	26365	26366	26366	she	935	“ Your couch could seat a family of six . I ’m just happy to . . . ”
26374	26394	26366	26366	she	935	“ Thank you . For chasing him off . This has been the most embarrassing night of my life . ”
26395	26398	26399	26399	He	97	“ Why ? ”
26417	26431	26413	26413	she	935	“ You did n’t throw a brick through your own window , right ? ”
26432	26443	26444	26444	She	935	“ I just never thought I ’d be that girl . ”
26468	26477	26456	26456	she	935	“ The one who needs a restraining order . ”
26478	26487	26488	26488	he	97	“ We need a drink , I think , ”
26495	26529	26530	26530	He	97	“ I do n’t entertain . So there ’s either Diet Coke or hard liquor . Scotch is my drink of choice . I ’ll bring you both , and you can decide . ”
26536	26550	26530	26530	He	97	“ I do n’t drink diet sodas . That shit can kill you . ”
26554	26568	26569	26569	He	97	“ If you feel the same about Scotch , do n’t tell me . ”
26608	26615	26594	26594	He	97	“ You ’re in , right ? ”
26616	26620	26621	26621	He	97	“ Hell yes . ”
26640	26651	26652	26652	O’Doul	97	“ God , I love that smell . So good . ”
26659	26671	26652	26652	O’Doul	97	“ I would n’t have picked you for a Scotch drinker . ”
26672	26687	26688	26688	He	97	“ Why ? You think yoga teachers sit around drinking shots of kale juice ? ”
26691	26705	26688	26688	He	97	“ No . Okay , maybe . But you drink wine with Georgia . ”
26706	26744	26652	26652	O’Doul	97	“ I drink wine with Georgia because Georgia likes the company . And because it ’s a habit . My ex did n’t think a lady should drink Scotch . He never offered me any of his . ”
26776	26794	26762	26762	O’Doul	97	“ To your health , and to your ex taking a long walk off a short pier . ”
26825	26835	26809	26809	He	97	“ So what made you finally kick him out ? ”
26850	26942	26809	26809	He	97	“ He stopped being nice to me . But I hung on a long time hoping things would get better . He ’d supported me when I wanted to go to school for massage therapy . So I told myself that I should be there for him even during the rough times , you know ? I wanted to be loyal . It was my idea to let go of his high - rent place in the city and move into my uncle ’s house when Uncle Alberto moved to Florida . ”
26943	26950	27011	27011	O’Doul	97	“ Nice house by the way . ”
26951	26997	26809	26809	He	97	“ Thanks . I pay ridiculously low rent in exchange for keeping the place up . But after we moved there , Vince just got mean . At first it was just petty criticism . He started insulting me in front of people we knew . ”
27025	27084	27011	27011	O’Doul	97	“ Then I got the job for the team , and he seemed happy for me . At first . But I was gone a lot . He hated that . He started questioning my whereabouts and acting like a jealous freak . I thought maybe things would turn around for him and he ’d just ease up . ”
27127	27130	27131	27131	O’Doul	97	“ Hey , ”
27134	27143	27131	27131	O’Doul	97	“ You do n’t have to tell me . ”
27144	27150	27153	27153	her	946	“ It ’s . . . ”
27168	27185	27151	27151	she	946	“ He got a little physical one night , and I left him the next day . ”
27191	27200	27201	27201	She	946	“ Is that what happened to your foot ? ”
27204	27251	27201	27201	She	946	“ But please do n’t say anything . I did n’t tell anyone the truth about that , except for Becca . I ’d go over to Becca ’s tonight , but she and Georgia went wedding dress shopping and then out to dinner . Shit . ”
27263	27271	27252	27252	She	946	“ You probably had plans , too . ”
27297	27313	27285	27285	He	97	“ I ’m pretty sure the team can get drunk without my help for once . ”
27342	27348	27327	27327	O’Doul	97	“ Did you eat dinner ? ”
27349	27365	27366	27366	He	97	“ Yes . I was just throwing away my takeout box when the shouting started . ”
27369	27396	27366	27366	He	97	“ Good . I could probably dig up some crackers , but that ’s about it . My fridge is nothing but ketchup and old leftovers . ”
27397	27435	27327	27327	O’Doul	97	“ Well , you ’re on the road half the time . And in New York , nobody needs to cook anyway . I wonder what players do in the flyover states . Starve , I guess . ”
27436	27447	27448	27448	He	97	“ I wish . They ’d be easier to beat . ”
27458	27485	27454	27454	she	946	“ If you think you ’re going to crash , help yourself to anything in the bathroom . I ’ll make up the bed for you . ”
27486	27497	27327	27327	O’Doul	97	“ I really do n’t want to put you out . ”
27507	27510	27511	27511	he	97	“ Naw , ”
27517	27542	27511	27511	he	97	“ Been a while since I ’ve been to a pajama party . We can braid each other ’s hair and tell ghost stories . ”
27697	27705	27706	27706	she	946	“ Did you furnish this place yourself ? ”
27732	27780	27722	27722	He	97	“ Not hardly . I bought the apartment from a married couple — David and Dexter — who were moving into an antique house in San Francisco . They had bought all this Scandinavian stuff and were fretting about how it would n’t match the new place . ”
27789	27818	27781	27781	He	97	“ So I bought , like , all their stuff . Even the dishes . Did n’t have to set foot in a store . Best deal ever . ”
27819	27834	27722	27722	He	97	“ That was very pragmatic of you . David and Dexter have lovely taste . ”
27835	27859	27935	27935	O’Doul	97	“ I know , right ? But I probably would have bought it even if everything was mint green . I hate shopping . ”
27860	27874	27875	27875	He	97	“ And you do n’t entertain very much ? Your place is nice . ”
27883	27903	27875	27875	He	97	“ It took me a long time to get my own place . I ’m not used to sharing . ”
27917	27934	27935	27935	O’Doul	97	“ What do you mean it took you a long time to get your own place ? ”
27942	27953	27935	27935	O’Doul	97	“ Did n’t get any help , that ’s all . ”
27954	27959	27960	27960	she	955	“ From your parents ? ”
27963	27971	27972	27972	He	97	“ Do n’t have any of those . ”
28079	28086	28068	28068	he	97	“ Is this Face / Off ? ”
28087	28090	28091	28091	He	97	“ Yeah . ”
28135	28142	28125	28125	He	97	“ Do you like this movie ? ”
28143	28163	28164	28164	He	97	“ Of course . Nicolas Cage has the coolest money clip . A golden dragon head . Totally badass . ”
28667	28673	28674	28674	he	97	“ Come on , sweetheart , ”
28683	28690	28691	28691	He	97	“ Time to hit the hay . ”
28734	28739	28740	28740	he	97	“ There you go , ”
28866	28873	28853	28853	He	97	“ What ’s that , sweetheart ? ”
28901	28915	28885	28885	He	97	“ You ’re going to be fine , you know that , right ? ”
29489	29492	29493	29493	she	204	“ Hi , ”
29497	29506	29493	29493	she	204	“ Hi yourself . You a coffee drinker ? ”
29514	29520	29521	29521	she	204	“ The stronger the better , ”
29524	29552	29521	29521	she	204	“ I knew I liked you . I ’ll make some . We have about thirty minutes until the car comes . The shower is all yours . ”
29553	29557	29558	29558	she	204	“ Thank you , ”
29743	29751	29752	29752	she	204	“ You have the most amazing shower , ”
29759	29769	29752	29752	she	204	“ It ’s my favorite thing about this apartment , ”
29773	29799	29752	29752	she	204	“ I do n’t know why the builder decided to put in three separate sprays , but I like it . Milk for your coffee ? ”
29800	29806	29807	29807	He	97	“ If you have it . ”
29818	29821	29822	29822	He	97	“ Always . ”
29850	29856	29830	29830	She	204	“ Patrick , thank you . ”
29857	29862	29863	29863	he	97	“ It ’s nothing , ”
29872	29876	29877	29877	she	204	“ Not true , ”
29888	29925	29877	29877	she	204	“ Yesterday was a total shit show . I know it was just a coincidence that you were the one to witness it . But I really appreciate all the help . You have no idea . ”
29926	29929	29930	29930	He	97	“ Well . ”
29935	29950	29932	29932	his	97	“ Do n’t mention it . Just glad I got there when I did . ”
29965	29978	29979	29979	He	97	“ Our car is downstairs . You need anything before we go ? ”
29987	29999	29979	29979	He	97	“ I ’ll just need another minute to grab my things . ”
30179	30186	30187	30187	Georgia	104	“ I ’m not buying it , ”
30227	30237	30238	30238	Ari	204	“ Suit yourself , but it did n’t happen , ”
30248	30264	30238	30238	Ari	204	“ These are really good , by the way . I love spicy peanut oil . ”
30265	30272	30273	30273	Georgia	104	“ You ’re changing the subject , ”
30276	30282	30283	30283	She	204	“ If you say so . ”
30295	30306	30283	30283	She	204	“ Wait . Really ? You did n’t hook up ? ”
30312	30332	30309	30309	her	204	“ I was having a rough day . My , uh , ex was giving me a hard time . ”
30333	30338	30339	30339	Georgia	104	“ Oh , no ! ”
30346	30352	30339	30339	Georgia	104	“ What did he do ? ”
30353	30365	30373	30373	She	104	“ He was just being a dick . Yelling at me . ”
30398	30441	30391	30391	she	104	“ You and Becca were dress shopping , and O’Doul was in the neighborhood . So I went home with him . No sex happened . But I got drunk and passed out on his couch in front of Face / Off . ”
30442	30445	30446	30446	Georgia	104	“ Bummer . ”
30451	30468	30446	30446	Georgia	104	“ I like my version of events better . More hot sex . Fewer terrible exes . ”
30469	30482	30391	30391	she	104	“ I know , right ? But it ’s not like that . ”
30483	30490	30491	30491	Georgia	104	“ Could it be , though ? ”
30498	30556	30491	30491	Georgia	104	“ I was kidding a second ago , but I ’m serious now . I used to think O’Doul was an ass . But now I think he ’s just really lonely . My gut says that if the right girl softened him up a little , he ’d be the most loyal man who ever lived . ”
30576	30605	30574	30574	her	204	“ Someone else will have to win that prize . I have n’t been single since I was twenty - one . I need a break from men . ”
30647	30655	30574	30574	her	204	“ Was he awful ? Your ex ? ”
30658	30704	30574	30574	her	204	“ I do n’t even know how to answer that . I put up with too much from him . I was like a frog sitting in the water on the stovetop . The water got hotter and hotter , and I did n’t jump . ”
30705	30712	30713	30713	Georgia	104	“ But then you finally did , ”
30789	30806	30807	30807	Georgia	104	“ So , do n’t keep me hanging . Did you find a dress last night ? ”
30810	30834	30807	30807	Georgia	104	“ I found a dozen of them . Becca made me try on so many they ’ve all blurred together in my mind . ”
30835	30841	30971	30971	Georgia	104	“ Ah . You overshopped . ”
30842	30937	30807	30807	Georgia	104	“ I did ! Becca has some serious stamina . I swear to god , she has a special notebook just for my wedding , with dividers and sections , and a place to put pictures she ’s clipped . No wonder she ’s such a good office manager . But it ’s killing me . I ca n’t wait to marry Leo . But the ceremony is twenty minutes , right ? Is it awful that I ’m way more interested in making it to the play - offs than in flower arrangements ? ”
30938	30952	30807	30807	Georgia	104	“ It ’s fine . But you do need to choose a dress . ”
30953	30970	30971	30971	Georgia	104	“ I think I did . Hang on — you can tell me what you think . ”
30995	31000	30983	30983	She	104	“ Nice . Wow . ”
31019	31031	30983	30983	She	104	“ Did you buy it ? That ’s kind of perfect . ”
31032	31093	31094	31094	Ari	204	“ Not yet , but I will . In fact , I ’ll call them today and ask them to put it aside for me . Becca has this idea that we ’re going to look at some other shops . But I do n’t see the point . I ’m going to wear it once . Why shop twice ? ”
31103	31116	31098	31098	Georgia	104	“ It really suits you , too . It ’s not fussy . ”
31117	31151	30983	30983	She	104	“ Thanks . I had no idea just how fussy those suckers could be . I put my foot down when Becca wanted me to try one with beads on it . Beads ! ”
31152	31156	31157	31157	Ari	204	“ The horror , ”
31160	31221	31157	31157	Ari	204	“ I know , right ? I made the mistake of asking Becca if she thought I could get away with a dress that was n’t so weddingy , so I could wear it again . The poor girl almost had a coronary . So I tried on a dress with lace on it just to make her feel better . ”
31222	31231	31232	31232	Ari	204	“ I do n’t see you in lace , ”
31235	31247	31248	31248	She	204	“ Buy the one in the picture . You look amazing . ”
31254	31291	31248	31248	She	204	“ When I was a little girl I did that thing where you put a white T - shirt over your hair and pretend to get married . I could n’t wait to plan my wedding . ”
31292	31297	31298	31298	Georgia	104	“ Hmm . . . ”
31310	31364	31298	31298	Georgia	104	“ I did n’t play wedding . But I did practice standing on the podium at Wimbledon , and curtseying for the queen . So I ca n’t claim to be any less vain . And that Wimbledon thing is n’t happening for me , so I might as well throw a wedding . ”
31390	31443	31444	31444	Georgia	104	“ When I was twenty - two years old , I was sure that Vince and I would get married . And even as things sort of fell apart with him , I still hoped he ’d pull it together so we could plan our future . God , that was stupid . ”
31453	31466	31444	31444	Georgia	104	“ I ’m sorry . But there are better men out there . ”
31467	31470	31471	31471	She	104	“ Yeah . ”
31476	31512	31473	31473	her	104	“ Last night I was trying to explain to O’Doul why I stayed with Vince for so long . Everything I said sounded lame . And I did n’t even tell him the worst reason . ”
31518	31523	31513	31513	Georgia	104	“ What ’s that ? ”
31524	31557	31444	31444	Georgia	104	“ I want a child . I ’ll be thirty next year , damn it . I was hoping things with Vince would get better so that we could start a family . ”
31558	31565	31566	31566	Georgia	104	“ But you ’re still young ! ”
31571	31601	31566	31566	Georgia	104	“ Five years from now you could have a husband and two kids . Lots of people do n’t have kids until their thirties . This is n’t 1950 . ”
31602	31650	31444	31444	Georgia	104	“ I ’m just so annoyed with myself . When I teach a yoga class , I ’m standing there asking everyone in the room to become mindful of their surroundings . But it turns out I was n’t doing such a great job of that myself . ”
31651	31657	31658	31658	Georgia	104	“ I do n’t know , ”
31662	31676	31658	31658	Georgia	104	“ You got the hell away from him the moment it mattered most . ”
31677	31684	31444	31444	Georgia	104	“ That ’s what Patrick said . ”
31729	31734	31735	31735	Georgia	104	“ So , wait , ”
31741	31755	31735	31735	Georgia	104	“ Back up a second . You stayed with Doulie in his apartment ? ”
31756	31767	31768	31768	Georgia	104	“ Sure ? Where else would I stay with him ? ”
31773	31789	31768	31768	Georgia	104	“ See , this is gossip ! Nobody has ever been to O’Doul ’s apartment . ”
31790	31801	31735	31735	Georgia	104	“ What do you mean , nobody ? I have . ”
31802	31856	31857	31857	Ari	204	“ I know ! But he ’s never invited his teammates over . Ever . What was it like in there ? Castro has this theory that O’Doul has a sex dungeon that he does n’t want anyone to see . They tease him about it sometimes , but he does n’t react . ”
31866	31909	31857	31857	Ari	204	“ That ’s ridiculous . O’Doul ’s place is lovely . It ’s a loft space , though . All one room . Maybe that ’s why he does n’t like to entertain ? The bed is right there in the room . ”
31921	31947	31910	31910	Georgia	104	“ Maybe the secret chamber is hidden behind a bookshelf . There could be a special brick — push it and the wall swings open . ”
31948	31954	31955	31955	Ari	204	“ That must be it , ”
32058	32067	32068	32068	Castro	109	“ You ’re marrying me someday , right ? ”
32076	32079	32080	32080	she	204	“ Mmm ? ”
32089	32095	32080	32080	she	204	“ Just my usual proposal , ”
32100	32114	32115	32115	She	204	“ But you seem distracted today . I ’m gon na get offended . ”
32414	32421	32408	32408	Patrick	97	“ Trying to kill us today ? ”
32422	32433	32434	32434	she	204	“ That would n’t be good for my job security , ”
32438	32455	32434	32434	she	204	“ I ’m only trying to make it possible for you to rest before the game . ”
32456	32462	32474	32474	He	97	“ I think it worked . ”
32463	32470	32471	32471	she	204	“ Go right upstairs and nap , ”
32717	32720	32721	32721	Georgia	104	“ Jesus , ”
32879	32886	32887	32888	the trainer	764	“ Let me see your face , ”
32930	32934	32919	32919	Hands	163	“ That hurts ? ”
32938	32941	32935	32935	Henry	114	“ No . ”
32952	32973	32942	32942	I	0	“ Does n’t look too bad . We ’ll need to check for concussion symptoms . How ’s the hip ? ”
32974	32977	32982	32982	He	97	“ Fine . ”
33017	33028	33029	33029	Henry	114	“ Come on . The doc needs to evaluate you . ”
33032	33040	33029	33029	Henry	114	“ I ’m not leaving the game . ”
33053	33076	33041	33041	Henry	114	“ You need to be evaluated . If the doctor is impressed , you ’ll be back when the overtime period starts . ”
33196	33203	33204	33205	Coach Worthington	135	“ Ca n’t win ’em all , ”
33259	33262	33263	33263	he	97	“ Hi , ”
33269	33276	33263	33263	he	97	“ Are you . . . ? ”
33283	33290	33277	33277	He	97	“ I ’m fine . Really . ”
33291	33297	33334	33334	He	97	“ Looked like it hurt . ”
33298	33305	33306	33306	She	204	“ I ’ve had better days . ”
33318	33329	33311	33311	her	204	“ Yeah . Do they have whiskey on the jet ? ”
33330	33333	33334	33334	He	97	“ Why ? ”
33346	33351	33334	33334	He	97	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
33352	33355	33356	33356	She	204	“ Nothing . ”
33370	33373	33374	33374	he	97	“ Sweetheart , ”
33377	33385	33374	33374	he	97	“ Come on . You look freaked . ”
33393	33401	33374	33374	he	97	“ I ’m tired of being freaked . ”
33402	33424	33425	33425	She	204	“ Sing it , sister . But we do n’t always get what we want . Just tell me what happened . ”
33431	33477	33425	33425	She	204	“ My tenant had to call the cops earlier . Vince showed up to saw the basement door off its hinges . I thought he might try something . All he had to do to know I was n’t home was read the game schedule . ”
33478	33485	33374	33374	he	97	“ Shit . I ’m sorry . ”
33486	33549	33550	33550	She	1049	“ He was removing stuff from the storage room when the cops showed , but Maddy thinks they did n’t catch him . So now I have a broken window and a broken door . I need to follow up with the police . And my first appointment is supposed to be at nine in the morning and I just . . . ”
33559	33592	33593	33593	He	1050	“ Hey , do n’t worry . Henry will understand if you need a couple extra hours tomorrow . There ’s no single - malt on the jet , but . . . ”
33600	33607	33593	33593	He	1050	“ Jill , how are you ? ”
33608	33619	33593	33593	He	1050	“ Excellent , Doulie ! What can I bring you ? ”
33620	33638	33593	33593	He	1050	“ Everyone in this row has had a shit day . We need something fun to drink . ”
33639	33644	33645	33647	the young woman	1052	“ Like a margarita ? ”
33650	33665	33645	33647	the young woman	1052	“ That ’s what I drink when I need more fun in my life . ”
33666	33674	33675	33675	he	1050	“ How do you feel about margaritas ? ”
33679	33686	33687	33687	she	1052	“ I ’m a lifelong fan , ”
33690	33697	33687	33687	she	1052	“ Two of those , please . ”
33705	33709	33710	33710	Ari	204	“ Thank you , ”
33713	33726	33710	33710	Ari	204	“ I say that a lot lately . But I mean it . ”
33727	33731	33732	33732	he	1050	“ I know , ”
33736	33751	33732	33732	he	1050	“ This too shall pass . And in the meantime , there ’s tequila . ”
33776	33784	33785	33785	she	204	“ Thank you for dropping me off , ”
33837	33848	33821	33821	She	204	“ Do n’t you need him to wait for you ? ”
33849	33870	33821	33821	She	204	“ Nah . It ’s just a couple of blocks . I want to make sure you ’re okay here . ”
33884	33907	33876	33876	her	204	“ Well , thanks . It ’s not like I expect to find him lurking in the shadows , but . . . ”
33954	33967	33968	33968	She	204	“ Do you want to take a look around back , first ? ”
33972	33975	33968	33968	She	204	“ Sure . ”
34037	34041	34042	34042	Ari	204	“ All right , ”
34049	34060	34042	34042	Ari	204	“ I guess I ’m not looking in there tonight . ”
34068	34077	34042	34042	Ari	204	“ The door can be fixed pretty easily , ”
34082	34086	34087	34087	she	204	“ I know , ”
34165	34169	34170	34170	he	546	“ Look okay ? ”
34173	34188	34170	34170	he	546	“ So far , so good . I do n’t think anyone was here . ”
34189	34197	34198	34198	He	546	“ Let ’s just have a look . ”
34269	34280	34266	34267	nobody there	1074	“ Is there access from the basement into your apartment ? ”
34281	34291	34292	34292	She	204	“ Yes and no . I ’ll show you . ”
34328	34348	34292	34292	She	204	“ This is the basement door . I never open it because there ’s no light over the stairs . ”
34349	34363	34292	34292	She	204	“ Okay . And nobody came through here tonight . You ’d know . ”
34364	34396	34397	34397	She	204	“ Right . I ’d have another broken door . So it looks like he did n’t try to get inside the house . Or he did n’t have enough time . ”
34433	34440	34441	34441	She	204	“ You hear anything up there ? ”
34508	34514	34515	34515	she	204	“ Does it look okay ? ”
34523	34528	34529	34529	He	546	“ Sure , sweetheart . ”
34534	34543	34544	34544	He	546	“ Except we missed this chunk of glass . ”
34611	34617	34618	34618	She	204	“ Are you all right ? ”
35198	35204	35205	35205	he	546	“ Tell me to stop , ”
35257	35263	35264	35264	he	546	“ Tell me to stop , ”
35339	35345	35346	35346	he	546	“ So I ’m staying ? ”
35776	35779	35773	35773	he	546	“ Fuck . ”
35829	35833	35834	35834	he	546	“ Lie down , ”
36038	36041	36042	36042	she	204	“ Oh , ”
36298	36301	36302	36302	she	204	“ What ? ”
36309	36320	36306	36306	He	546	“ Just enjoying the view . Is that so wrong ? ”
36554	36568	36547	36547	his	546	“ You ready ? Because you are going to get it so good . ”
36711	36716	36717	36717	he	546	“ So fucking sweet , ”
37017	37020	37021	37021	he	546	“ Fuck , ”
37024	37033	37021	37021	he	546	“ Now I know how people get religion . ”
37041	37047	37034	37034	She	204	“ What religion is this ? ”
37062	37074	37056	37056	his	546	“ Dunno . Ca n’t string a sentence together right now . ”
37152	37159	37160	37160	he	546	“ So this is a problem , ”
37174	37187	37160	37160	he	546	“ Ca n’t we put off the regrets until daylight at least ? ”
37188	37196	37197	37197	he	546	“ What regrets ? I have none , ”
37200	37236	37197	37197	he	546	“ The problem is that I already get boned up on your massage table . Next time you put your hands on me at work I ’m gon na start moaning like a porn star . ”
37237	37248	37249	37249	she	204	“ Might have to get out a gag for you , ”
37259	37273	37252	37252	He	546	“ Doubt it ’ll work . Probably just turn me into a submissive . ”
37547	37552	37553	37553	She	204	“ You can stay . ”
37558	37574	37575	37575	He	546	“ I mean , if you want to . It ’s pretty late . . . ”
37591	37626	37627	37627	He	546	“ Not leaving you here alone , sweetheart . You do n’t know if dumbass is going to try to break in again , and it ’s too late to talk to the cops . ”
37631	37645	37646	37646	He	546	“ So it ’s your place or mine . And yours is closer . ”
37761	37764	37720	37720	she	204	“ Patrick . ”
37765	37768	37726	37726	Sleepy	167	“ Mmh . ”
37769	37772	37720	37720	she	204	“ Patrick . ”
37780	37783	37720	37720	she	204	“ Mmh ? ”
37784	37793	37794	37794	His	546	“ There are cops at my front door . ”
37799	37802	37794	37794	His	546	“ Really ? ”
37803	37817	37720	37720	she	204	“ Someone ’s knocking , and there ’s a cruiser out in front . ”
37818	37821	37822	37822	He	546	“ Fuck . ”
37890	37898	37882	37882	He	546	“ Good morning . Welcome to chaos . ”
37899	37902	37882	37882	He	546	“ Right . ”
37903	37916	37917	37917	She	204	“ I ’ll tell them I need a minute to get dressed . ”
37968	37972	37973	37973	he	546	“ Good morning , ”
37992	38013	38014	38015	The dectective	1120	“ I ’m Detective Miller of the eighty - fourth precinct . Looking to speak to a Mr. Alberto Bettini . ”
38020	38038	38014	38015	The dectective	1120	“ But that ’s not you . Hey — aren’t you Patrick O’Doul ? Am I crazy ? ”
38039	38050	38051	38051	Patrick	97	“ Could n’t say if you ’re crazy , man , ”
38060	38067	38051	38051	Patrick	97	“ I ’m O’Doul , though . ”
38080	38093	38068	38069	The detective	1121	“ Nice to meet you . Saw the Rangers game last month . ”
38094	38097	38098	38098	Ari	204	“ Patrick ? ”
38104	38109	38098	38098	Ari	204	“ Is everything okay ? ”
38128	38141	38116	38116	Ari	204	“ I need to speak with the owner . Is Alberto here ? ”
38142	38162	38114	38114	him	546	“ I ’m his niece , and I look after the house . Uncle Alberto lives in West Palm . ”
38163	38179	38180	38180	He	546	“ Ah . Well , we have a warrant to search the property , miss . ”
38188	38195	38180	38180	He	546	“ Search it ? For what ? ”
38196	38229	38230	38230	Ari	204	“ Your neighbor who called in the B&E — she identified the burglar as Vincent Giardi . He ’s under investigation by law enforcement , and this is his last known address . ”
38242	38247	38230	38230	Ari	204	“ Investigation for what ? ”
38248	38280	38281	38281	O’Doul	97	“ We ca n’t disclose the details of our investigation . But we believe — and the judge believes — that Mr. Giardi was conducting illegal business activities from this property . ”
38297	38305	38306	38306	Ari	204	“ He does n’t live here now , ”
38309	38326	38306	38306	Ari	204	“ I ’ve been trying to get rid of his stuff in my basement for weeks . ”
38327	38332	38333	38334	the detective	1121	“ I hear you , ”
38338	38359	38333	38334	the detective	1121	“ But the warrant is valid . Do you mind answering some questions while Officer Brock takes a look around ? ”
38378	38392	38393	38393	He	97	“ So I just have to let them in ? That ’s it ? ”
38404	38429	38393	38393	He	97	“ Sweetheart , I know I ’m supposed to be the heavy in this relationship . But I ’ve only seen warrants on television . ”
38450	38454	38455	38455	he	97	“ Call Rebecca , ”
38458	38472	38455	38455	he	97	“ Tell her that you need to talk to a lawyer , stat . ”
38493	38517	38480	38481	The detective	1121	“ She ’s not supposed to leave my sight . I was trying to be helpful by not asking you two to leave . ”
38518	38521	38522	38522	Patrick	97	“ Ari ! ”
38528	38537	38538	38538	She	204	“ Can you make your call down here ? ”
38565	38601	38553	38553	she	204	“ Becca ! I ’ve got a situation . Can you pull out whatever file you keep lawyers in ? The douchewhistle has struck again . There are cops searching my house for unlawful activities . ”
38611	38624	38602	38602	She	204	“ I appreciate it . You , too , honey . Later . ”
38632	38640	38641	38641	she	204	“ Should n’t you be at practice ? ”
38655	38676	38677	38677	He	1127	“ They were n’t going to let me skate this morning anyway . I ’ll check in a bit later . ”
38688	38715	38677	38677	He	1127	“ How about I order some egg sandwiches and coffee ? We might as well eat while you wait out the long arm of the law . ”
38721	38741	38716	38716	She	204	“ Okay . I mean , you probably need to get going . So I ’m good either way . ”
38755	38764	38765	38765	He	1127	“ I ’m going to call the deli . ”
38781	38787	38788	38788	She	204	“ Unlock this for me ? ”
38898	38914	38915	38916	the detective	1121	“ When was the last time Mr. Giardi was inside this portion of the house ? ”
38919	38923	38924	38924	she	204	“ January 28th , ”
38928	38971	38924	38924	she	204	“ I threw him out that night , with my tenant ’s help . We moved all his possessions into the storage room , because it has separate access . I changed my locks that day , but not on the basement . ”
38972	38975	38885	38887	the uniformed cop	1136	“ Why ? ”
38976	39049	39144	39145	The agent	1139	“ Because I was not going to put his fancy clothes on the curb ! I was trying to be civilized . But he did n’t get lost like I asked him to . Instead of just removing his stuff , he kept hanging around the place . These past few weeks I kept seeing him out the window , more times than you ’d need to take care of some clothes . ”
39050	39063	38924	38924	she	204	“ When ’s the last time you saw him go in there ? ”
39064	39143	39144	39145	The agent	1139	“ Last Thursday . I was on my way to the stadium for the game against D.C. I saw him out the window , and there was another man , too . They were talking . The other guy left first , and then Vince left . On my way to the stadium that afternoon I went outside to try to figure out what he was up to . And I saw that he ’d locked me out . ”
39150	39166	39144	39145	The agent	1139	“ Yeah ? Then why did he have to saw open the door last night ? ”
39167	39172	39173	39173	Ari	204	“ Because I retaliated ! ”
39184	39239	39173	39173	Ari	204	“ I had the locksmith remove his locks and add mine . I knew he ’d be pissed off , but I did n’t know how else to make my point . He does n’t answer my e - mails . I ’ve asked him to get his things out of there for weeks . ”
39240	39248	39173	39173	Ari	204	“ Would you show me those emails ? ”
39274	39286	39268	39268	he	97	“ Do you want to wait and talk to a lawyer ? ”
39293	39318	39287	39287	She	1140	“ I do n’t have anything to hide . I just want this cleared up . And I need a restraining order against him . ”
39319	39330	39331	39331	he	97	“ Now there ’s an idea I can get behind , ”
39428	39433	39434	39434	he	97	“ Hey , man , ”
39439	39449	39434	39434	he	97	“ Mind if I grab my wallet from upstairs ? ”
39450	39463	39464	39464	O’Doul	97	“ Go ahead . I think my guy is done up there . ”
39480	39483	39484	39484	he	97	“ Coffee ? ”
39499	39502	39503	39504	the guy	375	“ Thanks , ”
39507	39511	39503	39504	the guy	375	“ Appreciate it . ”
39528	39531	39532	39532	he	97	“ Honey , ”
39554	39573	39574	39574	Ari	204	“ You want me to get plates ? I do n’t want to get crumbs on your couch . ”
39642	39651	39652	39652	she	204	“ Not as much as you ’d think , ”
39658	39725	39652	39652	she	204	“ Three years ago he had several clubs . But I ’m pretty sure he ’s down to just one . And I think he owes some people money . He never told me his troubles directly , but I heard him on the phone sometimes , and his mood has been really foul since the fall . And that ’s all I can tell you . ”
39726	39733	39769	39770	the cop	1127	“ How long were you together ? ”
39734	39738	39739	39740	The cop	1127	“ Eight years . ”
39745	39759	39739	39740	The cop	1127	“ Eight years ? And you do n’t know more about his business ? ”
39781	39883	39775	39775	Ari	204	“ Look , I have my own job , okay ? And Vince did n’t like that so much . And he had a big chest - beating macho streak . When things went wrong , I was the last person he ’d tell . We did n’t do a lot of tell me about your day at work , honey . Besides — his club has a business office . It ’s not like he was running the whole show out of my home . I showed his ass the door , and we have not had a conversation since . ”
39884	39887	39888	39889	The detective	1121	“ Okay . ”
39894	39915	39888	39889	The detective	1121	“ Then can you tell me who he worked with ? You must have heard names , or answered calls . ”
39921	39939	39918	39918	her	1121	“ The co - owned clubs were with the Pryzyks . They were brothers , I think . ”
39954	39960	39961	39962	the detective	1121	“ You ever meet them ? ”
39965	40009	39961	39962	the detective	1121	“ Once . Maybe a year ago ? I met Vince at his office because we were going to the opera . And they were there . Not the most friendly people . I did n’t feel the urge to see them again . ”
40010	40019	40020	40021	the detective	1121	“ So you never socialized with his colleagues ? ”
40037	40054	40055	40055	she	204	“ When I was young and working in Vince ’s first club , I knew everyone , ”
40058	40100	40055	40055	she	204	“ They were my second family . But when I left to do training in yoga and massage therapy , I was n’t around anymore . And the turnover in nightclubs is pretty high . All my favorite people moved on . ”
40101	40104	40105	40106	the detective	1121	“ Okay , ”
40118	40134	40105	40106	the detective	1121	“ Can you tell me if Vincent ever said anything about drugs in his clubs ? ”
40195	40263	40264	40264	Ari	204	“ Vince told me once that every club had problems with drugs — that it was hard to keep the dealers out . And then , sure enough , one of his clubs kept getting busted and they lost the liquor license . But he did n’t share specifics , and I did n’t ask because he was such a grumpy bastard all the time about it . ”
40289	40312	40280	40280	he	1127	“ To your knowledge did Vince Giardi ever decide to use the flow of drugs as an opportunity rather than a problem ? ”
40319	40329	40280	40280	he	1127	“ You mean . . . encourage the dealing ? ”
40330	40337	40338	40339	the agent	1139	“ Did he take a cut ? ”
40362	40371	40372	40372	she	204	“ God , I do n’t think so , ”
40376	40469	40372	40372	she	204	“ I mean , he ’d never tell me if he did . But the thing about Vince is that he is n’t really a schemer . He ’d rather pour you a drink and take a spin on the dance floor . Even when he was trying to build up his empire , it was all about the clubs themselves — which A - list celebs were going to show up , which DJs he could book . He got into the business because he wanted to party for a living . ”
40475	40533	40470	40470	She	204	“ I do n’t think he was the best businessman , honestly . I know he had money problems after the one club was shut down . He owed the Pryzyk brothers money , I think . Either that or he owed somebody else money , and he was trying to get the Pryzyks to help him . ”
40534	40541	40542	40542	She	204	“ Why do you think so ? ”
40551	40603	40604	40604	she	204	“ His phone would ring with their name on the screen . He ’d disappear into another room and argue for a while . I got the impression he wanted their help . But I never heard both sides of the conversation . That ’s really all I can tell you , ”
40618	40624	40607	40608	The cop	1127	“ Okay . Thank you . ”
40629	40639	40607	40608	The cop	1127	“ Have you ever heard the name Andre Karsecki ? ”
40640	40645	40646	40646	Ari	204	“ Um . . . ”
40651	40658	40646	40646	Ari	204	“ No ? Who ’s that ? ”
40664	40679	40659	40659	O’Doul	97	“ I saw it in the newspaper — an unsolved murder in a nightclub . ”
40699	40722	40691	40691	Ari	204	“ Look , I told you everything I know about Vince ’s work . I wish I ’d never met the guy . ”
40723	40754	40755	40756	the detective	1121	“ We ’re going to inventory the items from your storage room downstairs , and remove the computer we found there . Did you keep any valuables in that room ? ”
40759	40816	40817	40817	He	1121	“ Depends who you ask . The collection of vinyl albums is my uncle’s — they’re valuable to him , but I have no idea if they ’re worth any actual money . Aside from a few pieces of old furniture I did n’t want , nothing else in that room was put there by me . ”
40822	40829	40817	40817	He	1121	“ Any files ? Any notes ? ”
40830	40835	40836	40836	she	1165	“ All Vince ’s , ”
40840	40887	40836	40836	she	1165	“ When I looked through the window the other day , I saw a computer I ’d never seen before . I have no idea how he was working out of that room . I changed the Wi - Fi password after he left , too . ”
40888	40894	40895	40896	the cop	1127	“ There was a splice , ”
40902	40912	40895	40896	the cop	1127	“ A direct line running from your cable connection . ”
40913	40917	40918	40918	Ari	204	“ Damn it ! ”
40921	40925	40918	40918	Ari	204	“ That asshole . ”
40937	40946	40926	40926	O’Doul	97	“ When can she fix the lock again ? ”
40950	40965	40926	40926	O’Doul	97	“ It is n’t safe to leave that open . Someone could take advantage . ”
40966	40979	40980	40981	the detective	1121	“ We ’ll call you when we ’re finished with our investigation , ”
40987	40997	40980	40981	the detective	1121	“ Should n’t be more than a few days . ”
40998	41004	41005	41005	O’Doul	97	“ Like , maybe tomorrow ? ”
41020	41023	41024	41025	The guy	375	“ Maybe . ”
41029	41045	41046	41047	The detective	1121	“ Uh - huh . And how does she get a restraining order against him ? ”
41055	41091	41046	41047	The detective	1121	“ That ’s not my specialty , but call my office line and ask my assistant to e - mail you the forms . She ’ll need to go to the courthouse on Jay Street . ”
41107	41117	41092	41092	Ari	204	“ Thank you . I ’ll do that today . ”
41146	41151	41140	41140	he	97	“ Are you okay ? ”
41152	41155	41157	41157	her	204	“ Fine . ”
41169	41189	41157	41157	her	204	“ You ’d better report to the trainers ’ office . They must wonder where the hell you are . ”
41198	41208	41190	41190	She	204	“ Did Becca e - mail you some lawyers ? ”
41209	41216	41217	41217	Ari	204	“ I ’m sure she did . ”
41221	41238	41219	41219	herself	204	“ Thank you for chatting up the cop . I know you were trying to help , but”—she
41249	41256	41219	41219	herself	204	toe—“I can take it from here . ”
41257	41260	41261	41261	he	1172	“ Okay , ”
41282	41286	41270	41270	He	1172	“ Be well . ”
41466	41471	41472	41472	Coach	135	“ Got a second ? ”
41496	41502	41482	41482	He	97	“ Is there a problem ? ”
41508	41517	41505	41505	his	135	“ Just wondering what you think of something . ”
41518	41521	41482	41482	He	97	“ Shoot . ”
41522	41535	41536	41536	O’Doul	97	“ How do you like the idea of Crikey fighting tomorrow night ? ”
41542	41545	41536	41536	O’Doul	97	“ Why ? ”
41546	41556	41557	41557	Coach	135	“ To take some of the pressure off you , ”
41561	41570	41557	41557	Coach	135	“ Give your strain a little extra cushion . ”
41571	41577	41578	41578	he	97	“ I can handle it , ”
41626	41635	41636	41636	Hugh	150	“ The kid wants to fight , though , ”
41642	41657	41636	41636	Hugh	150	“ This guy Falzgar used to beat the crap out of him in juniors . ”
41658	41696	41713	41713	Fuck	181	“ So we ’re just gon na let him work out his vendetta in the middle of the game ? That is not a strategy . And Falzgar is a leftie . Has Crikey fought a leftie ? ”
41715	41721	41722	41722	Coach	135	“ We need you healthy , ”
41725	41748	41722	41722	Coach	135	“ You can take tomorrow ’s fight . But only if you are a hundred percent sure you ’re up to it . ”
41749	41753	41754	41754	he	97	“ I am , ”
41771	41794	41765	41765	Hugh	150	“ The salary cap means this team wo n’t ever have another dedicated enforcer . Every player is here for his skills . ”
41795	41799	41800	41800	O’Doul	97	“ I know , ”
41803	41822	41800	41800	O’Doul	97	“ If the fighting gets in the way of your skills , it ’s bad for the team . ”
41823	41826	41827	41827	He	97	“ True . ”
41842	41847	41839	41839	Hugh	150	“ Rest up tonight . ”
41848	41854	41855	41855	He	97	“ Thanks , I will . ”
42140	42150	42151	42151	she	119	“ I ’ll bring a movie and some takeout , ”
42339	42342	42343	42343	Becca	119	“ Ari ? ”
42351	42363	42364	42364	She	204	“ I have Indian food and a DVD of Magic Mike ! ”
42369	42377	42364	42364	She	204	“ Well , step right this way . ”
42409	42416	42398	42398	She	119	“ You look guilty . Why ? ”
42417	42422	42423	42423	Ari	204	“ I do not ! ”
42426	42434	42423	42423	Ari	204	“ You so do . What happened ? ”
42438	42451	42452	42452	she	119	“ Patrick and I attacked each other like horny rabbits last night , ”
42456	42464	42452	42452	she	119	“ But it ’s never happening again . ”
42485	42510	42465	42465	Becca	119	“ Wait . Patrick ? As in . . . O’Doul ? You call him Patrick ? Nobody calls him by his first name . ”
42511	42523	42524	42524	She	119	“ Really ? That ’s what you find shocking about this ? ”
42536	42555	42524	42524	She	119	“ My life is a train wreck , and I just made it worse by screwing a client . ”
42556	42573	42465	42465	Becca	119	“ Let ’s not be hasty . Was he good ? Maybe it ’s worth it . ”
42574	42579	42580	42580	Ari	204	“ It was epic , ”
42589	42619	42580	42580	Ari	204	“ Then again , for the past few years I ’ve only had sex with someone who resented me half the time . So maybe my viewpoint is skewed . ”
42620	42623	42624	42624	Becca	119	“ God . ”
42631	42684	42685	42685	She	119	“ These days , even a night with someone who resented me sounds appealing . Why do you think I own Channing Tatum on DVD ? Because I get no action . All day I ’m surrounded by hard bodies at work , and yet my vibrator is always on the charger . ”
42696	42704	42705	42705	Ari	204	“ You could hook up , though , ”
42709	42741	42705	42705	Ari	204	“ It would be less scandalous for you to get busy with a player than for me . You do n’t have to touch their bodies in the line of duty . ”
42742	42750	42751	42751	Becca	119	“ You ’d think nobody would care , ”
42763	42819	42751	42751	Becca	119	“ But once when Castro was having a shitty day I got him drunk in a hotel bar . Nate saw us all cozy and laughing in a booth at the bar and got the wrong impression . He was cold to me for a while after that . So I ’m not going there . ”
42828	42835	42751	42751	Becca	119	“ Seriously ? Nate got mad ? ”
42836	42859	42751	42751	Becca	119	“ Hell yes . I swear I did n’t imagine it . He was kind of a dick to Castro , too . ”
42860	42863	42864	42864	Ari	204	“ Shit , ”
42867	42884	42864	42864	Ari	204	“ I ca n’t risk my job . I ’m going to swear Patrick to secrecy . ”
42885	42892	42893	42893	Becca	119	“ He ’s a decent guy , ”
42903	42939	42893	42893	Becca	119	“ He puts up an asshole front , and he ’s kind of an egomaniac . But he ’s got that whole macho honor code thing working . So I think you ’ll be fine . ”
42940	42943	42864	42864	Ari	204	“ Ugh . ”
42966	42991	42956	42956	she	119	“ How did it happen , anyway ? Did he give you that overconfident squint and say , hey , baby , wanna bang ? ”
42992	43047	43048	43048	Becca	119	“ No ! Geez . We did n’t talk about it first . He got out of the taxi here and helped me make sure the house was secure . And then we just looked at each other and . . . it was like someone pulled the pin on a grenade . Kapow . ”
43062	43089	43090	43090	She	119	“ Oh , man . Just once in my life I want to feel like that . I had so many bad first dates last year . ”
43099	43104	43090	43090	She	119	“ Nothing went kapow . ”
43254	43260	43249	43249	Becca	119	“ Should you check that ? ”
43261	43267	43249	43249	Becca	119	“ Oh , I suppose . ”
43350	43369	43370	43370	Ari	204	“ Omigod . Did O’Doul text you ? You should see the look on your face right now . ”
43376	43386	43370	43370	Ari	204	“ He ’s just making sure I ’m okay . ”
43387	43392	43393	43393	Becca	119	“ Uh - huh . ”
43398	43413	43393	43393	Becca	119	“ If he ’s on his way over here I ’ll make myself scarce . ”
43414	43435	43370	43370	Ari	204	“ No ! That is not happening . Start the movie . We ’re just up to the good part . ”
43436	43444	43445	43445	Becca	119	“ It ’s all the good part , ”
43449	43468	43445	43445	Becca	119	“ But you ’d better reply or he ’ll be knocking on your door five minutes from now . ”
43531	43538	43539	43539	she	119	“ He ’s flirting with you ! ”
43547	43554	43555	43555	Ari	204	“ This is so high school , ”
43576	43584	43585	43585	Becca	119	“ What the hell did you do ? ”
43594	43606	43607	43607	Becca	119	“ Wash what ? You ’re going to get me fired . ”
43610	43621	43607	43607	Becca	119	“ It was supposed to say watch . Damn autocorrect . ”
43633	43640	43630	43630	Ari	204	“ I ’m afraid to look . ”
43641	43646	43647	43647	Becca	119	“ I ’ll look ! ”
43716	43723	43724	43724	Becca	119	“ You ’ve seen his shower ? ”
43733	43745	43724	43724	Becca	119	“ I thought he did n’t let people into his apartment ? ”
43790	43805	43779	43779	Becca	119	“ I ca n’t even with this . Who knew O’Doul was a romantic ? ”
43830	43837	43870	43870	She	119	“ More Tatum . Less talking . ”
43954	43958	43959	43959	she	119	“ Good morning , ”
43971	43980	43959	43959	she	119	“ How are your hip flexors feeling today ? ”
44071	44076	44077	44077	he	97	“ Hi , sweetheart , ”
44081	44086	44077	44077	he	97	“ You doing okay ? ”
44089	44095	44096	44096	she	119	“ I ’m doing well , ”
44110	44156	44096	44096	she	119	“ I got an order of protection , and hired a process server to track Vince down to serve it . And the lawyer Becca recommended is ready to step in if the cops try to tie me to any of Vince ’s shady dealings . ”
44157	44162	44163	44163	Patrick	97	“ That ’s good , ”
44199	44205	44180	44180	he	97	“ No Pearl Jam today ? ”
44206	44215	44216	44216	She	119	“ Um , I can turn it on . ”
44230	44238	44216	44216	She	119	“ After we have a quick chat . ”
44252	44259	44247	44247	he	97	“ What ’s on your mind ? ”
44260	44276	44247	44247	he	97	“ It ’s about the other night . We ca n’t have a repeat performance . ”
44277	44282	44283	44283	he	97	“ Of course not , ”
44318	44330	44331	44331	he	97	“ . . . I mean , not an exact repeat , ”
44334	44354	44331	44331	he	97	“ I like to mix it up a little . The shower sounds good . Up against the wall . ”
44355	44358	44359	44359	she	119	“ Patrick , ”
44362	44378	44379	44379	She	119	“ I ’m not joking . We obviously have a bit of chemistry . . . ”
44403	44427	44400	44400	He	97	“ We have a bit of chemistry . And hockey has a bit of violence . We practically burned down your bed together . ”
44432	44458	44459	44459	He	97	“ Be that as it may , I need this job . It ’s the only part of my life that did n’t just implode . ”
44470	44478	44459	44459	He	97	“ I would never jeopardize your job . ”
44479	44483	44400	44400	He	97	“ Thank you . ”
44484	44515	44400	44400	He	97	“ But I call bullshit . If you want to give me the brush - off you ’re going to have to do a little better than that flimsy excuse . ”
44516	44540	44459	44459	He	97	“ It is n’t flimsy ! I have it on good authority that Nate does n’t like his staff , um . . . ”
44541	44555	44400	44400	He	97	“ . . . Making the players come so hard they see stars ? ”
44556	44567	44568	44568	He	97	“ I would have put it differently . But yes . ”
44571	44590	44568	44568	He	97	“ And yet Georgia is marrying Leo . I do n’t see her looking for a new job . ”
44591	44600	44601	44601	She	1215	“ Her dad is the coach ? Hello ? ”
44612	44618	44619	44619	she	1215	“ You seem tight today , ”
44623	44635	44619	44619	she	1215	“ It wore off , I guess . Your latest treatment . ”
44636	44652	44568	44568	He	97	“ Well , it ’s been a few days since you were on the table . ”
44653	44662	44663	44663	She	1215	“ That ’s not the treatment I meant . ”
44670	44677	44663	44663	She	1215	“ Do n’t make that joke . ”
44686	44723	44568	44568	He	97	“ I ’m not a prude , and I do n’t think it ’s all that big of a deal to , um , get carried away one night with a friend from work . But this here”—she
44726	44773	44663	44663	She	1215	room—“is my professional space . I would n’t ever touch a client inappropriately . It would violate the trust that you give me when you climb onto my table . And I ’m sorry if that sounds really nitpicky , but the distinction matters to me . ”
44796	44799	44787	44787	she	1215	“ Sorry . ”
44809	44822	44801	44801	Patrick	97	“ I understand , baby . I wo n’t tease you anymore . ”
44823	44827	44787	44787	she	1215	“ Thank you . ”
44828	44834	44835	44835	She	1215	“ Not here , anyway . ”
44844	44861	44841	44841	he	97	“ Can I have Pearl Jam , at least ? I ’ll be a good boy . ”
44862	44868	44869	44869	She	1215	“ Yes , you can . ”
44885	44900	44869	44869	She	1215	“ Now tell me why you ’re so stiff , without using any innuendo . ”
44901	44924	44841	44841	he	97	“ You take all my fun away . Fine . Tonight we play Buffalo and I have to fight this asshole Falzgar . ”
44925	44935	44936	44936	she	1215	“ And you ’re not looking forward to it , ”
44939	44947	44936	44936	she	1215	“ Ca n’t say that I am . ”
44948	44964	44970	44970	he	1216	“ Let ’s work those hip flexors , shall we ? Roll to the side . ”
45143	45157	45134	45134	Patrick	97	“ Something the matter ? I thought you liked ‘ Better Man ’ ? ”
45158	45170	45176	45176	he	97	“ Eh . That song is n’t my favorite right now . ”
45184	45192	45176	45176	he	97	“ It hits too close to home ? ”
45214	45244	45245	45245	His	97	“ The girl in the song stays with a guy who is n’t good to her . I never thought I was that girl , and then I was . ”
45252	45276	45245	45245	His	97	“ This is a serious problem now . We ca n’t let that asshole put you off a perfectly good Pearl Jam tune . ”
45277	45282	45283	45283	Ari	204	“ I ’ll manage . ”
45294	45299	45300	45300	He	97	“ No , babe . ”
45313	45329	45330	45330	He	97	“ Turn over if you ’re going to talk . You ’re wrecking your alignment . ”
45334	45347	45330	45330	He	97	“ The thing is , I think you ’ve misinterpreted the song . ”
45348	45356	45383	45383	His	97	“ I really do n’t think so . ”
45357	45371	45330	45330	He	97	“ That song is really about a girl who ’s making some toast . ”
45372	45375	45376	45376	Her	204	“ Toast ? ”
45392	45407	45383	45383	His	97	“ Yeah . See , she ’s standing in front of the refrigerator . And she”—he
45410	45430	45330	45330	He	97	song—“can’t find the butter , man ! She ca n’t find the butter , maa - aa - aan . ”
45431	45437	45438	45438	she	204	“ Oh . My god , ”
45441	45449	45438	45438	she	204	“ That is the worst pun ever . ”
45465	45480	45450	45450	He	97	“ You ’re smiling now , though . So I think I did okay . ”
45538	45555	45527	45527	He	97	“ I think I ’m getting the hang of this massage thing . You schooled me . ”
45571	45584	45585	45585	He	97	“ You could teach a course on how to get a massage . ”
45588	45612	45585	45585	He	97	“ Massage for Dummies . Chapter one — how to lie on a table and let a beautiful woman touch your naked body . ”
45618	45638	45613	45613	She	204	“ Do n’t do that — don’t make fun of yourself for not liking it . Everyone is different . ”
45644	45668	45613	45613	She	204	“ But I do like it now . Do n’t even think about quitting this place , because I ’m used to you . ”
45669	45693	45585	45585	He	97	“ I have no plans to quit . It ’s too much fun making a room full of hockey players do sun salutations . ”
45694	45703	45704	45704	he	97	“ Does n’t it bug you , though ? ”
45708	45733	45704	45704	he	97	“ You teach us a whole lot of Zen shit , and then we use it to beat the crap out of each other . ”
45734	45748	45749	45749	His	97	“ I want business cards with that title — Teacher of Zen Shit . ”
45757	45764	45749	45749	His	97	“ You know what I mean . ”
45765	45827	45704	45704	he	97	“ It does n’t bother me at all . In the first place , there ’s plenty I admire about your team . The dedication to success is impressive . And I like working with people who understand their bodies . I never have to convince an athlete that a mind - body connection exists . You guys all get it . ”
45828	45836	45837	45837	he	97	“ But you still hate the fighting , ”
45840	45848	45849	45849	she	204	“ The fighting is n’t my favorite , ”
45852	45864	45849	45849	she	204	“ But I do n’t think it ’s your favorite either . ”
45865	45871	45872	45872	he	97	“ Not all the time , ”
45875	45917	45872	45872	he	97	“ The hours before a fight are the worst . I spend a lot of time worrying about how to make this guy my bitch without getting too hurt , while he tries to make me his bitch without getting hurt . ”
45918	45924	45925	45925	He	97	“ So you get anxious . ”
45930	45937	45925	45925	He	97	“ It ’s more like dread . ”
45938	45943	45849	45849	she	204	“ Okay , dread . ”
45954	45977	45978	45978	His	97	“ Maybe we can find you a meditation for those hours . Something that redirects your energy in a more positive way . ”
45983	45995	45978	45978	His	97	“ I do n’t think I ’m very good at meditating . ”
45996	46001	46002	46002	Ari	204	“ Neither am I , ”
46005	46056	46002	46002	Ari	204	“ But that does n’t mean it is n’t helping . An old Buddhist monk told me once that the mind is like an untrained monkey . If you do n’t give it something to do , it will tear your house apart and smear shit on all the walls . ”
46057	46060	45978	45978	His	97	“ Really ? ”
46078	46086	46069	46069	Patrick	97	“ I want to meet this monk . ”
46087	46117	46118	46118	Patrick	97	“ Really . He said meditation gives your monkey something better to do . Even if you think you ’re bad at it , the monkey is still busy . ”
46128	46185	46118	46118	Patrick	97	“ I like your style , sweetheart . But I ca n’t always connect to the meditations you give us during yoga . It ’s like I ca n’t shut off my cynical brain . You tell me to soar like an eagle , and I ’m thinking , there are n’t any eagles in Brooklyn . ”
46186	46210	46069	46069	Patrick	97	“ Uh - huh . So you need the Brooklyn version of a guided meditation ? More trash on the beach ? Fuhggeddaboudit ? ”
46211	46214	46118	46118	Patrick	97	“ Yeah . ”
46215	46225	46226	46226	He	97	“ I can do that . Close your eyes . ”
46239	46249	46250	46250	she	204	“ I want you to listen to my voice , ”
46264	46291	46250	46250	she	204	“ Do your best to follow my instructions . Take a deep , slow breath and will yourself to be fully here , inside the moment . ”
46300	46340	46341	46341	He	97	“ . . . Make a calm space inside yourself for your breath . Let the inhale fill you with strength . On the exhale , I want you to gradually expel all the bullshit of the external world . ”
46356	46361	46362	46362	she	204	“ That ’s it , ”
46365	46408	46362	46362	she	204	“ Center your awareness on your breathing . If you find your mind wandering to other thoughts , simply acknowledge that all is fucking horseshit . Let it go . Listen to your inner stillness . Breathe in calm . Exhale bullshit . ”
46417	46442	46443	46443	She	204	“ You think I ’m not serious ? Meditation can sound however you need it to . It ’s your show , big man . ”
46459	46470	46448	46448	He	97	“ You are priceless . I hope you know that . ”
46471	46475	46476	46476	she	204	“ Thank you , ”
46494	46504	46476	46476	she	204	“ And now unfortunately we are out of time . ”
46696	46699	46700	46700	Beringer	113	“ Hey ! ”
46703	46719	46700	46700	Beringer	113	“ You have fifty - one percent on HockeyBrawls.com ! I call that a win . ”
46720	46729	46730	46730	Beacon	164	“ I see fifty - one point four ! ”
46739	46747	46730	46730	Beacon	164	“ Another beer for the point four ! ”
46807	46810	46811	46811	He	97	“ Pete . ”
46820	46851	46811	46811	He	97	“ I want to take care of whatever these assholes drink tonight . Can you run it now and just cash me out later ? I ’m sneakin ’ out . ”
46858	46877	46852	46852	Pete	146	“ I ’ll e - mail the bill to Rebecca . That ’s what we did last time . ”
46878	46882	46883	46883	He	97	“ Good man . ”
46941	46945	46946	46946	He	97	“ You ass . ”
46949	46958	46946	46946	He	97	“ I answer to that all the time . ”
46970	46975	46962	46962	she	204	“ Had enough scotch ? ”
46976	46980	46981	46981	She	204	“ Had plenty . ”
46988	46992	46981	46981	She	204	“ You okay ? ”
46993	46998	46999	46999	He	97	“ Course I am . ”
47007	47023	46999	46999	He	97	“ Did n’t even have to take a punch tonight , so I ’m solid . ”
47039	47047	47024	47024	Ari	204	“ This muscle looks unhappy , though . ”
47063	47074	47048	47048	He	97	“ It ’s a weird night , that ’s all . ”
47075	47084	47085	47085	Women	189	“ Are you pissed at Crikey for fighting ? ”
47094	47115	47085	47085	Women	189	“ I was . But he seems pretty happy with the outcome . I used to be just like that . ”
47116	47120	47048	47048	He	97	“ Like what ? ”
47121	47195	47196	47196	She	1237	“ Sort of incredulous about the whole thing . I was young and stupid and they paid me a half million dollars a year to do something that used to get me thrown out of school . I thought I ’d cracked the secret code of the universe , you know ? People wanted my autograph , even though I was really just a thug trying to smash his demons for high pay . ”
47203	47209	47196	47196	She	1237	“ But it got old ? ”
47210	47254	47048	47048	He	97	“ Fuck yeah . It ’s hell on your body . And then it ’s too late — you’re already that guy who fights . So you have to fight everybody for the rest of your career . I ca n’t just stop . ”
47255	47259	47260	47260	He	1238	“ Why not ? ”
47272	47372	47260	47260	He	1238	“ There ’s no shame in being a player who does n’t fight . A lot of guys just do n’t know how , or they ’re too valuable as snipers . If Bayer or Trevi fucked up his hand , it would be a scoring disaster . But if I start refusing to fight , I ’m a guy who backs down . They ’d say — look at that poor old fucker . He ca n’t take it . If people do n’t see me like that I can still have another few years in the league . ”
47373	47401	47402	47402	He	1239	“ Maybe Crikey wants to take some of the pressure off you . If there ’re two enforcers , neither of you has to do it all . ”
47405	47437	47402	47402	He	1239	“ Like a job share . If some hammerhead challenges me on the rink , I can just say , talk to Crikey . I do n’t throw down on Thursdays . ”
47438	47445	47446	47446	He	1239	“ It was just a thought . ”
47471	47562	47446	47446	He	1239	“ I know . I appreciate it . And Crikey has no idea what he ’s getting into . Maybe it seemed like a big adventure tonight . But next month maybe he hurts somebody really bad . Or he loses a fight and people jeer and throw food at him . He does n’t know all the shit that can happen . He does n’t know to wonder if some asshole fan goes home drunk after the game and tries to imitate your signature left hook on his wife . ”
47563	47566	47683	47683	Ari	204	“ Jesus . ”
47567	47571	47683	47683	Ari	204	“ You asked . ”
47589	47592	47683	47683	Ari	204	“ Sorry . ”
47593	47606	47683	47683	Ari	204	“ No , I want to know what ’s in your head . ”
47607	47610	47611	47611	She	1241	“ Why ? ”
47622	47650	47611	47611	She	1241	“ I think you like me , Ariana . S’okay , though . You do n’t have to admit it . It can be our little secret . ”
47651	47657	47658	47658	she	1241	“ You passed your street , ”
47663	47678	47658	47658	she	1241	“ No kidding . I ’m walking the lady home . It ’s late . ”
47685	47697	47683	47683	Ari	204	“ I appreciate it . But I ’m going in alone . ”
47698	47704	47705	47705	he	1239	“ Of course you are , ”
47791	47797	47782	47782	He	1239	“ Good night , sweetheart . ”
47798	47802	47803	47803	She	1241	“ Good night . ”
47813	47820	47803	47803	She	1241	“ Thanks for walking me home . ”
48073	48082	48067	48067	Ari	204	“ Good night , sweetheart . Sleep well . ”
48116	48122	48106	48106	she	1241	“ Good night , Patrick . ”
48145	48156	48157	48157	She	1241	“ Let me hear you lock that door behind you . ”
48897	48909	48883	48883	Trevor	191	“ Hugh Major would like a word with you in private . ”
48919	48923	48924	48924	she	204	“ Thank you , ”
49068	49072	49060	49060	She	204	“ Come in ! ”
49099	49106	49092	49092	his	97	“ You wanted to see me ? ”
49107	49121	49138	49139	the men	1232	“ Sit down , Ariana . We have a bit of a situation . ”
49183	49224	49173	49173	Hugh	150	“ Ariana , it seems you have a stalker . O’Doul brought it to my attention , but I do need you to know that you can always ask the organization for help with any security issues you ’re facing . ”
49319	49324	49325	49325	Patrick	97	“ Turn it over , ”
49388	49395	49376	49376	she	204	“ Where did it come from ? ”
49410	49436	49396	49396	Patrick	97	“ It was delivered to the Bruisers offices this morning in an unmarked envelope . But it ’s not hard to guess who sent it . ”
49443	49447	49448	49448	she	204	“ My ex , ”
49474	49479	49448	49448	she	204	“ I ’m sorry . ”
49480	49485	49486	49486	Hugh	150	“ No , Ari , ”
49489	49535	49486	49486	Hugh	150	“ Do n’t apologize . This is n’t your fault . But we ’re really good at security around here . You can tell us if there ’s a problem . I ’m going to ask our security team to make you a panic button . ”
49550	49588	49536	49536	He	150	“ It ’s a little device this big . You can wear it around your neck . If you push the button , Kattenberger Technologies routes the emergency to law enforcement and our private team , too . ”
49591	49598	49599	49599	she	1297	“ That ’s really not necessary , ”
49631	49649	49626	49626	Hugh	150	“ I think it is . I hear you have an order of protection against this asshole ? ”
49650	49655	49656	49656	she	1297	“ I got one , ”
49673	49694	49658	49658	her	1297	“ But it has n’t been served to him yet . The process server I hired ca n’t find him . ”
49716	49743	49744	49744	Ari	204	“ I want you to keep me apprised of the situation , okay ? This guy involved my organization when he sent the photo to O’Doul . ”
49756	49783	49784	49784	Hugh	150	“ The reason we employ such an excellent security staff is that our athletes draw all kinds of unwanted attention . That ’s not your fault , ”
49788	49834	49784	49784	Hugh	150	“ The moment you joined our organization , your security needs changed . There will always be assholes who want to try to use your access to the team for their own ends . That ’s why we ’re equipped to handle situations like this . ”
49835	49839	49840	49840	she	204	“ I understand , ”
49860	49877	49851	49851	Hugh	150	“ Would you mind providing my security team with a copy of your order of protection ? ”
49878	49881	49882	49882	she	204	“ Sure , ”
49895	49960	49851	49851	Hugh	150	“ Thank you . I ’m turning this over to the security team when we land . But I ’ll need you to report the photo to the police who opened the file after your break - in . I ’ll email you a scan of the front and back . If they want the original , they can have that in two days . ”
49961	49969	49970	49970	she	204	“ I ’ll send it to them , ”
49981	49995	49973	49973	Hugh	150	“ Hang in there . Nobody ’s gon na let him near you . ”
49996	50000	50001	50001	She	204	“ Thank you . ”
50016	50023	50024	50024	Patrick	97	“ Ariana , I ’m sorry , ”
50292	50303	50304	50304	Castro	109	“ Let ’s pick a place with dancing this time , ”
50307	50317	50318	50318	Beringer	113	“ Curfew is in an hour and a half , ”
50321	50329	50318	50318	Beringer	113	“ Let ’s just pick someplace close . ”
50349	50354	50355	50355	he	97	“ Hi , sweetheart , ”
50372	50375	50376	50376	she	204	“ Hi , ”
50433	50437	50438	50438	she	204	“ What floor ? ”
50442	50445	50438	50438	she	204	“ Seven . ”
50456	50467	50469	50469	they	1319	“ I guess we ’re going to the same place . ”
50488	50493	50494	50494	he	97	“ We ’re neighbors , ”
50497	50502	50494	50494	he	97	“ I see that . ”
50552	50555	50558	50558	boy	660	“ Ari ? ”
50582	50587	50569	50569	she	204	“ What is it ? ”
50588	50596	50597	50597	He	97	“ I ’m sorry about the picture . ”
50605	50625	50597	50597	He	97	“ I know you hate that Hugh saw it . I think it ’s fine , but . . . ”
50626	50643	50569	50569	she	204	“ It ’s not fine . I do n’t want to be everyone ’s gossip nugget . ”
50644	50649	50650	50650	he	97	“ I get that , ”
50654	50668	50650	50650	he	97	“ I ’d never have shown that photo to Hugh without your permission . ”
50675	50681	50669	50669	She	204	“ Then why did you ? ”
50682	50735	50569	50569	she	204	“ I did n’t . This envelope got dropped off at the office with my name on it — no return address . We get that shit sometimes . Instead of passing it to me , they gave it to the security team . They opened it and showed it to Hugh . ”
50736	50739	50669	50669	She	204	“ Oh . ”
50755	50783	50749	50749	Patrick	97	“ I ’m sorry if you ’re embarrassed . But I wo n’t apologize for kissing you . I ca n’t , because I ’m not sorry . ”
50858	50864	50850	50850	Patrick	97	“ Can I come in ? ”
50865	50869	50850	50850	Patrick	97	“ Absolutely not . ”
50870	50877	50850	50850	Patrick	97	“ Why ? Nobody will know . ”
50878	50889	50890	50890	He	97	“ That ’s what I used to assume , too . ”
50895	50919	50890	50890	He	97	“ The horse is already out of the barn , sweetheart . Why do the time if we ca n’t do the crime ? ”
50920	50929	50930	50930	He	97	“ It ’s just not a good idea . ”
50941	50947	50948	50948	he	97	“ I think it is , ”
50963	50968	50954	50954	His	97	“ You feel tight . ”
50969	50977	50954	50954	His	97	“ It ’s been a stressful day . ”
50978	50984	50954	50954	His	97	“ Too many massage appointments ? ”
50985	50991	50954	50954	His	97	“ Too much shitty news . ”
50992	50995	50996	50996	he	97	“ Mmm , ”
51008	51013	51014	51014	She	204	“ Who massages you ? ”
51017	51020	51014	51014	She	204	“ Nobody . ”
51021	51030	50954	50954	His	97	“ Uh - huh . Want a massage ? ”
51031	51046	50954	50954	His	97	“ I do n’t know . Would it be a prelude to something else ? ”
51047	51054	51055	51055	She	204	“ Is that a deal breaker ? ”
51065	51075	51055	51055	She	204	“ Depends . How skillful is your massage technique ? ”
51076	51096	51097	51097	She	204	“ For a guy who does n’t like to touch people , I ’d say I ’m pretty decent . ”
51100	51112	51097	51097	She	204	“ What the hell am I going to do with you ? ”
51113	51123	51124	51124	He	97	“ I ’m gon na let you find out . ”
51158	51167	51168	51168	he	97	“ Wait here . Where ’s your table ? ”
51174	51181	51168	51168	he	97	“ Oh . There it is . ”
51246	51255	51236	51236	he	97	“ Okay , sweetheart . Time to strip . ”
51265	51288	51289	51289	He	97	“ Really ? You ’re going to massage me ? Or are we , like , writing a porno flick right now ? ”
51299	51310	51311	51311	He	97	“ A little of both . Just work with me . ”
51334	51344	51325	51325	he	97	“ This is going to be so much fun . ”
51468	51478	51493	51493	he	97	“ Let ’s see your technique , big man . ”
51479	51492	51493	51493	he	97	“ All right , miss . Are you comfortable on the table ? ”
51496	51511	51512	51512	She	204	“ Do you have any pain or trouble spots I need to know about ? ”
51515	51522	51512	51512	She	204	“ I ’m fine , thanks . ”
51523	51526	51527	51527	He	97	“ Good . ”
51536	51560	51527	51527	He	97	“ Let me know if you feel too much pressure at any point . Massage does n’t have to hurt to do good . ”
51561	51571	51512	51512	She	204	“ Some smart person must have taught you that . ”
51572	51576	51577	51577	He	97	“ The smartest . ”
51713	51716	51717	51717	she	204	“ Omigod , ”
51730	51738	51717	51717	she	204	“ Arrrgh , that feels so good . ”
51739	51747	51717	51717	she	204	“ Not too much pressure , miss ? ”
51748	51755	51756	51756	she	204	“ Oh - hell - no , ”
51759	51764	51756	51756	she	204	“ Do n’t stop . ”
51765	51774	51775	51775	She	204	“ That ’s what all the ladies say . ”
51819	51828	51829	51829	he	97	“ Why do n’t you turn over now , ”
51837	51840	51829	51829	he	97	“ Mmkay . ”
52023	52029	52030	52030	he	97	“ Arms over your head , ”

52687	52692	52693	52693	she	204	“ Y - yes , ”
52698	52702	52703	52703	He	97	“ Like this . ”
52796	52800	52801	52801	he	97	“ Turn over , ”
52807	52814	52801	52801	he	97	“ Want to watch you come . ”

53148	53150	53151	53151	Patrick	97	“ Miss. ”
53154	53159	53151	53151	Patrick	97	“ Touch your breasts . ”
53181	53184	53185	53185	he	97	“ Fuck , ”
53312	53315	53316	53316	Ari	204	“ Wow , ”
53408	53411	53412	53412	he	97	“ Hi , ”
53415	53418	53412	53412	he	97	“ Hi . ”
53425	53436	53419	53419	She	204	“ I have a future in massage therapy , right ? ”
53437	53451	53412	53412	he	97	“ Uh - huh . Your technique is nonstandard , but highly effective . ”
53452	53457	53412	53412	he	97	“ You feel relaxed ? ”
53458	53461	53462	53462	He	97	“ Yup . ”
53546	53559	53560	53560	he	97	“ I know you hate it that Hugh wants to get involved , ”
53563	53572	53573	53573	She	204	“ But I think you should let him . ”
53576	53602	53573	53573	She	204	“ I know you ’re all just watching out for me . And it ’s not like I do n’t think he ’s a threat . ”
53613	53633	53573	53573	She	204	“ But now I ’m the girl who fools around at work and the girl with the crazy ex . ”
53634	53640	53641	53641	He	97	“ I know you worry . ”
53647	53660	53641	53641	He	97	“ But I do n’t think Hugh cares if we ’re together . ”
53661	53667	53668	53668	she	204	“ We are not together , ”
53696	53701	53702	53702	he	97	“ Uh - huh , ”
53713	53719	53702	53702	he	97	“ But we should be . ”
53720	53729	53730	53730	He	97	“ Why ? Besides the outrageously good sex . ”
53736	53745	53730	53730	He	97	“ That ’s not a good enough reason ? ”
53746	53750	53751	53751	He	97	“ Fuck no . ”
53764	53787	53755	53755	she	204	“ Because you ’re funny and smart . You ’re the coolest chick I know , and I like you a lot . ”
53806	53861	53875	53875	his	1339	“ That ’s really nice of you to say , but I ca n’t be with anybody right now . I have n’t been single since I was twenty - one years old , and my only ex is on a crime spree . The universe might be trying to send me a message . ”
53862	53871	53872	53872	he	1339	“ I ’m not that guy , Ari , ”
53885	53890	53891	53891	she	204	“ I know that , ”
53939	53976	53932	53932	she	467	“ Then you should also know that it ’s not like me to tell someone how much I like her . In fact , I want you to guess how many times I ’ve done that . ”
53977	53984	54028	54028	he	1339	“ Wait , you keep track ? ”
53985	53989	54028	54028	he	1339	“ Guess so . ”
53990	53996	53932	53932	she	467	“ I ca n’t guess . ”
53997	54002	54028	54028	he	1339	“ Fine . One . ”
54008	54013	54028	54028	he	1339	“ One other time ? ”
54014	54022	53932	53932	she	467	“ Nope . One including right now . ”
54023	54026	54028	54028	he	1339	“ Oh . ”
54033	54038	54039	54039	He	1339	“ I ’m honored . ”
54044	54049	54039	54039	He	1339	“ You should be . ”
54050	54059	54028	54028	he	1339	“ We still ca n’t date , though . ”
54060	54063	54064	54064	She	204	“ Okay . ”
54069	54072	54064	54064	She	204	“ Okay ? ”
54093	54116	54080	54080	He	1339	“ I ’ll take what I can get , sweetheart . Now get some sleep . I ’ve got a game tomorrow . ”
54323	54330	54331	54331	Coach	135	“ You look good this morning , ”
54339	54343	54344	54344	he	1339	“ Feel good , ”
54347	54354	54331	54331	Coach	135	“ You okay to fight tonight ? ”
54355	54358	54359	54359	he	1339	“ Sure , ”

54501	54509	54510	54510	He	195	“ My jaw is acting up again . ”
54518	54531	54510	54510	He	195	“ Might need surgery , actually . Ca n’t fight you tonight . ”
54532	54539	54546	54548	The other man	1356	“ Fuck , I ’m sorry . ”
54540	54545	54546	54548	The other man	1356	“ Yeah , thanks . ”

54647	54673	54644	54644	DiCoda	195	“ I do n’t think any of ’em have plans to take you on , so I ’ll tell ’em not to piss you off . ”
54674	54678	54679	54679	O’Doul	97	“ Good man , ”
54691	54694	54695	54695	DiCoda	195	“ Later , ”
55212	55220	55221	55222	The kid	353	“ Hey man . Where ’s breakfast ? ”
55230	55257	55221	55222	The kid	353	“ In the conference room behind me . That ’s why I ’m standing here like an idiot , to make sure you guys find it . ”
55271	55293	55258	55258	O’Doul	97	“ Come on , then . Let ’s eat . Anyone misbehaving today ? Do I have to knock any heads ? ”
55294	55314	55258	55258	O’Doul	97	“ Nope . The charter company did n’t even lose anyone ’s luggage . But the day is young . ”
55485	55492	55493	55493	Leo	110	“ How ’s tricks , captain ? ”
55496	55507	55493	55493	Leo	110	“ Did n’t see you at the bar last night . ”

55527	55538	55524	55524	his	97	“ Hey — college boy . I got a question . ”
55539	55542	55493	55493	Leo	110	“ Shoot . ”
55543	55562	55563	55563	Leo	110	“ What do you do if the girl you ’re meant to be with wo n’t date you ? ”
55571	55597	55563	55563	Leo	110	“ Well , if you ’re me , you date people you really do n’t like for five or six years until she comes around . ”
55598	55601	55563	55563	Leo	110	“ Huh . ”
55628	55635	55636	55636	he	97	“ Who has a better answer ? ”
55642	55645	55646	55646	Beacon	164	“ Well , ”

55802	55843	55844	55844	He	97	“ You ’re not my type or anything , but I ’ll bet the ladies see a rich guy who ’s not too ugly . The world is full of women who ’d make time in their schedule for you . ”
55847	55876	55844	55844	He	97	“ Thanks , B. My face is n’t the problem . She just got out of a relationship that ended badly . Does n’t wanna go back there . ”
55877	55884	55885	55885	Castro	109	“ That ’s cool , though , ”
55888	55909	55885	55885	Castro	109	“ You can just be her rebound guy . Plenty of sex , no commitment . Sounds good to me . ”
55910	55913	55914	55914	O’Doul	97	“ Nah , ”
55917	55922	55914	55914	O’Doul	97	“ I want more . ”
55923	55927	55928	55928	Castro	109	“ But why ? ”
55933	55957	55928	55928	Castro	109	“ In Canada we have this saying — you do n’t need your own rink if you can get ice time for free . ”
55980	55992	55993	55994	Leo Trevi	110	“ So , she just got out of a bad scene , ”
55998	56016	55993	55994	Leo Trevi	110	“ Maybe her ex had some bad habits . Maybe he did n’t treat her very well . ”
56022	56060	56017	56017	You	1407	“ . . . I think the solution might be to turn on the romance taps full blast , man . You have to woo her so she sees how different you are from the other loser . ”
56061	56071	56072	56072	he	110	“ Like . . . with candlelight and shit ? ”
56075	56079	56080	56080	Castro	109	“ Maybe jewelry , ”
56083	56088	56080	56080	Castro	109	“ Chicks like bling . ”
56089	56095	56096	56096	Leo	110	“ Not all of them , ”
56100	56125	56096	56096	Leo	110	“ My girl does n’t like jewelry , because it gets in her way when she feels like punishing me on the tennis court . ”
56175	56180	56181	56181	He	97	“ Okay , listen . ”
56186	56189	56181	56181	He	97	“ Jimbo ! ”
56199	56203	56190	56192	The younger man	1408	“ Whaddaya need ? ”
56204	56216	56196	56196	his	1408	“ Get out the parking tickets . Every player gets one . ”
56217	56222	56223	56223	Castro	109	“ What ? Why ? ”
56226	56278	56223	56223	Castro	109	“ Everyone here owes me an idea . You all have five minutes to write down the best way to romance a woman . If your idea is decent , you do n’t owe anything to the kitty . If your idea is shit , it ’s a twenty dollar fine . ”
56301	56308	56284	56284	Beacon	164	“ Let ’s just save time . ”
56323	56326	56327	56327	Castro	109	“ Doulie , ”
56330	56348	56327	56327	Castro	109	“ We do n’t know this chick . How are we supposed to guess what she likes ? ”
56349	56357	56367	56367	her	1410	“ She ’s , uh . . . ”
56374	56383	56384	56384	He	164	“ Well , she ’s smarter than me . ”
56390	56402	56384	56384	He	164	“ Do n’t say it — that ’s pretty much everyone . ”
56409	56422	56423	56423	Castro	109	“ Okay , she ’s thoughtful . Classy . Not into bling . ”
56428	56445	56425	56425	his	109	“ Bummer . It ’s easier when they ’re into bling . Expensive , but easier . ”
56488	56497	56498	56498	Castro	109	“ You have to read ’em out loud , ”
56501	56513	56498	56498	Castro	109	“ We ’re entitled to a little entertainment for our trouble . ”
56514	56520	56521	56521	Jimbo	138	“ I ’ll read ’em , ”
56536	56545	56524	56524	He	138	“ Buy her treats from her favorite bakery . ”
56546	56553	56554	56554	O’Doul	97	“ Not bad , College Boy , ”
56557	56563	56564	56564	Leo	110	“ Always works for me , ”
56584	56587	56588	56588	Jimbo	138	“ Next . ”
56593	56599	56588	56588	Jimbo	138	“ Write her a poem . ”
56600	56608	56609	56609	O’Doul	97	“ Christ , have you met me ? ”
56618	56626	56609	56609	O’Doul	97	“ Crikey puts twenty into the kitty . ”
56648	56658	56659	56661	the other player	1413	“ But you always do okay on karaoke night , ”
56664	56694	56659	56661	the other player	1413	“ And I saw it in a movie once . Chicks dig that shit . Does n’t matter if you do it well . Only that you do it . ”
56701	56710	56711	56711	Castro	109	“ Someone pass me a piece of paper , ”
56714	56731	56711	56711	Castro	109	“ Some of this shit might be useful later . I ’m gon na take notes . ”
56732	56737	56742	56742	Jimbo	138	“ Buy her shoes , ”
56745	56750	56742	56742	Jimbo	138	“ Chicks love shoes . ”
56751	56754	56755	56755	Leo	110	“ No , ”
56758	56781	56755	56755	Leo	110	“ They like shopping for shoes . Would you like it if somebody else picked out your shoes ? I would n’t . ”
56782	56786	56787	56787	O’Doul	97	“ Good point , ”
56809	56812	56755	56755	Leo	110	“ Next ! ”
56813	56822	56823	56823	Jimbo	138	“ Sully says , Take her ice skating , ”
56827	56838	56839	56839	he	138	“ Gosh , how ever did you think of that ? ”
56846	56873	56839	56839	he	138	“ Dude . Your skating is better than your poetry . And if she ca n’t skate , she ’ll have to hold onto your hands . ”
56874	56877	56823	56823	Jimbo	138	“ Awwwwww ! ”
56906	56911	56894	56894	O’Doul	97	“ Cook her dinner . ”
56912	56918	56919	56919	O’Doul	97	“ Not bad , Massey , ”
56924	56933	56919	56919	O’Doul	97	“ I can do linguini with clam sauce . ”
56973	56984	56985	56985	he	138	“ Those are fine ideas — three months from now , ”
56988	56993	56994	56996	the contributing player	1419	“ Have some patience , ”
56999	57017	57018	57018	Jimbo	138	“ Not my fault it ’s play - off season . Do n’t take my twenty bucks . ”
57045	57095	57038	57038	Castro	109	“ Bad idea , man . Seriously dangerous . I got into so much trouble for buying my girl size large once when she was a medium . If you ’re not a hundred percent sure of the size , you might not get any lovin’ for a week . ”
57175	57180	57166	57168	The first one	1423	“ What the fuck ? ”
57181	57184	57185	57185	Castro	109	“ Wait — ”
57191	57198	57199	57199	He	109	“ Who ’s eating whose underwear ? ”
57207	57239	57199	57199	He	109	“ Jimbo — fine Smithy . Okay — last one . Buy her birthstone earrings . Not only are they pretty but it shows that you know when her birthday is . ”
57240	57243	57244	57244	Leo	110	“ Whoa ! ”
57247	57259	57244	57244	Leo	110	“ Sneaky ! I like it . Whose idea was that ? ”
57269	57286	57260	57260	O’Doul	97	“ There ’s no name . Good idea , though . Anyone want to take credit ? ”
57303	57315	57300	57300	everybody	2664	“ Christ , kid . How old are you , anyway ? ”
57316	57319	57326	57326	somebody	414	“ Nineteen . ”
57329	57334	57326	57326	somebody	414	“ Jimbo for president ! ”
57335	57338	57339	57339	Castro	109	“ Wait , ”
57347	57362	57339	57339	Castro	109	“ What came right before the underwear ? I might have missed a couple . ”
57371	57395	57396	57396	He	97	“ Get your own ideas . It ’s been a pleasure , boys . We ’re watching tape in forty - five minutes . ”
57575	57579	57580	57580	she	1428	“ Good afternoon , ”
57584	57597	57580	57580	she	1428	“ Afternoon , Ariana . Can I see you for a moment ? ”
57598	57602	57558	57558	his	150	“ Of course . ”
57651	57656	57657	57657	Hugh	150	“ Have a seat , ”
57660	57679	57657	57657	Hugh	150	“ I just got a FedEx for you . It ’s a panic button . Have a look . ”
57680	57686	57690	57690	she	1428	“ Oh . Thank you . ”
57747	57763	57764	57764	he	150	“ It ’s well designed , so that you ca n’t trip it by accident , ”
57767	57779	57764	57764	he	150	“ Press the button now — it ’s not activated yet . ”
57780	57783	57784	57784	Ari	204	“ Okay . ”
57800	57813	57784	57784	Ari	204	“ I see . And I could clip this to my handbag . ”
57814	57823	57764	57764	he	150	“ Exactly . Or your belt at home . ”
57824	57829	57832	57832	her	1428	“ Well . . . ”
57835	57855	57856	57856	Hugh	150	“ I ’ll carry it , if you think I should . But it seems like an unnecessary expense . ”
57859	57899	57856	57856	Hugh	150	“ One of my many jobs is buying all kinds of insurance for the team . And I buy a ton of it , always hoping that it ’s a complete waste of money . Welcome to my world . ”
57909	57920	57856	57856	Hugh	150	“ So what happens if I do flip the switch ? ”
57921	57947	57764	57764	he	150	“ Several people will be alerted at once . Law enforcement at the precinct house . Also me , Rebecca — she volunteered . . . ”
57948	57958	57959	57959	Ari	204	“ Wow . Seems like a lot of trouble , ”
57964	58036	58038	58038	his	1442	“ Not as much trouble as if something happened to you . Take it . Wear it . I know it ’s not something you wanted , but we ca n’t have anyone using your position in the Bruisers organization as some kind of nasty leverage . If you push that button there are a few other people who will be notified , including whichever Kattenberger security team is on duty . And”—he
58039	58049	57959	57959	Ari	204	throat—“Patrick O’Doul . If that ’s okay with you . ”
58057	58064	58050	58050	She	204	“ If he does n’t mind . ”
58065	58069	58070	58070	Hugh	150	“ His idea , ”
58073	58090	58070	58070	Hugh	150	“ He lives so close to your house . But it ’s totally up to you . ”
58097	58125	58091	58091	Ari	204	“ Can I speak frankly , sir ? If you would rather I did n’t continue with Mr. O’Doul as my client , I would understand completely . ”
58163	58193	58156	58156	he	150	“ Ari , give me a second while I figure out how to put this in a way that wo n’t have the entire HR department on my ass . ”
58206	58278	58197	58197	his	150	“ Okay , it ’s like this . Everyone raves about your work . They even show up for fricking yoga without complaint . I ’m happy . The owner is happy . I do n’t need to change a thing . But if you notify me at any point that you ’re not comfortable treating a player on my team , other arrangements will be made . No questions asked . ”
58279	58285	58286	58286	she	1446	“ Thank you , sir , ”
58295	58310	58290	58290	He	2701	“ Do you wish to request a transfer of any player to another therapist ? ”
58311	58328	58329	58329	He	2701	“ Um , it ’s not necessary to make any changes on my account , sir . ”
58336	58385	58329	58329	He	2701	“ Good . Because Henry has been trying to get O’Doul to accept treatment for that hip for weeks . I need that player healthy and in fighting form . Whatever you can do to keep him showing up for therapy , I ’m on board . . . ”
58403	58418	58392	58392	he	2701	“ You know , that did n’t come out the way I meant it . ”
58426	58435	58419	58419	She	1446	“ I knew what you meant , sir . ”
58436	58439	58440	58440	He	2701	“ Fuck . ”
58446	58466	58442	58442	his	2701	“ HR hates me already . I just meant that using your professional skill , you ’d . . . ”
58467	58472	58473	58473	she	1446	“ I get it , ”
58480	58502	58473	58473	she	1446	“ And now if you ’ll excuse me , I have a whole list of players to keep in fighting form . ”
58509	58517	58503	58503	He	2701	“ Go forth and conquer muscle soreness . ”
58556	58559	58560	58560	he	97	“ Hi ! ”
58567	58570	58571	58571	she	1446	“ Hi , ”
58617	58624	58625	58625	she	1446	“ You feeling okay this morning ? ”
58628	58634	58625	58625	she	1446	“ How ’s your pain ? ”
58660	58683	58684	58684	She	1446	“ I feel like a million bucks , honestly . Skated well this morning . Had a good breakfast . No complaints . ”
58707	58715	58716	58716	he	97	“ Go ahead — do your worst , ”
58720	58725	58716	58716	he	97	“ I ’m ready . ”
58726	58729	58730	58730	she	1446	“ Good , ”
58739	58747	58748	58748	he	97	“ Oh — don’t forget the music , ”
58751	58756	58748	58748	he	97	“ Got any Clapton ? ”
58757	58760	58761	58761	She	1446	“ Sure . ”
58799	58802	58780	58780	She	1446	“ Wonderful Tonight ”
58838	58845	58846	58846	she	1446	“ We only have thirty minutes , ”
58861	58873	58846	58846	she	1446	“ So I have to get right to the trouble spots . ”
58874	58881	58882	58882	he	97	“ That ’s fine , sweetheart , ”
58982	58991	58992	58992	she	1446	“ Let ’s have you on your side , ”
58996	59003	58992	58992	she	1446	“ Let ’s work that hip . ”
59032	59037	59020	59020	he	97	“ Does that hurt ? ”
59038	59041	59042	59042	he	97	“ Nope , ”
59046	59055	59042	59042	he	97	“ Just distracting myself with some hockey stats . ”
59056	59063	59064	59064	He	97	“ Why ? Because of pain ? ”
59067	59088	59064	59064	He	97	“ My body has other reactions to your hands besides pain , sweetheart . Just trying to keep things professional . ”
59089	59099	59106	59106	she	1446	“ Ah . Roll onto your stomach for me . ”
59126	59154	59155	59155	He	97	“ Remember when I gave you that speech about how everyone has different reactions to massage ? Some people fall asleep , some people cry . . . ”
59163	59167	59155	59155	He	97	“ Uh huh . ”
59168	59182	59183	59183	His	97	“ There ’s probably a dent in my table from all the boners . ”
59193	59214	59190	59190	he	97	“ Whose ? I ’ll have to kill them now . Shame , too , right before play - offs . ”
59225	59265	59215	59215	She	1446	“ Do n’t say that . Sexual response is one of many possible results of muscle relaxation . It only means that the client ’s subconscious trusts me . I pretend not to notice , and life goes on . ”
59266	59283	59284	59284	he	97	“ My subconscious has a little more to go on than the rest of your clients , ”
59292	59320	59284	59284	he	97	“ I know . That ’s why if you wanted to switch to another therapist , Hugh said he ’d make other arrangements . No questions asked . ”
59335	59350	59321	59321	Patrick	97	“ Fuck no . You ’re the only one who gets to touch me . ”
59351	59354	59355	59355	she	1446	“ Okay , ”
59370	59386	59355	59355	she	1446	“ It was only a suggestion . I was trying to make you more comfortable . ”
59387	59391	59392	59392	he	97	“ Not possible , ”
59395	59409	59392	59392	he	97	“ I only want you , Ari . For this and all things . ”
59504	59510	59511	59511	he	97	“ Thank you , sweetheart , ”
59515	59529	59530	59530	she	1446	“ You ’re welcome , as always . See you for yoga later , ”
59904	59913	59914	59914	she	204	“ Hi , honey , I ’m home ! ”
60108	60113	60114	60114	he	97	“ Which cookie place ? ”
60124	60134	60114	60114	he	97	“ One Girl Cookies . That place on Main . ”
60135	60144	60114	60114	he	97	“ What ’s the best thing they have ? ”
60145	60168	60114	60114	he	97	“ Look , Doulie — I have a meeting . All the cookies are great , and the whoopie pies are awesome . ”
60169	60185	60114	60114	he	97	“ Huh . Do n’t know what that is , but I like the name . ”
60186	60221	60222	60222	She	119	“ I ’ll bet . The corner of Main and Water , buddy . Her birth month is August and she ’s a size small . But I ’ve got to go , okay ? ”
60602	60607	60593	60595	the team doctor	1490	“ Ow , fuck . ”
60616	60622	60623	60624	the doctor	2929	“ I ’m almost done , ”
60649	60655	60656	60656	he	97	“ What ’s the shcore ? ”
60659	60662	60663	60664	the doctor	2929	“ Dunno , ”
60667	60676	60677	60677	He	97	“ Does n’t really matter at the moment . ”
60824	60832	60833	60833	he	97	“ I ’ll ice it at home , ”
60891	60894	60895	60895	Ari	204	“ Jesus , ”
60915	60925	60911	60911	his	97	“ Sorry . Did n’t know it was you . ”
60943	60961	60935	60935	She	204	“ Wow . Only one of us is allowed to be jumpy at a time , okay ? ”
60962	60967	60968	60968	He	97	“ You ’re jumpy ? ”
60972	60977	60968	60968	He	97	“ Is something wrong ? ”
60986	61025	60978	60978	She	204	“ I ’m fine . I thought I saw a certain van in the neighborhood tonight on my way here . I ’m probably just paranoid , but I was going to ask you to walk me home . ”
61026	61032	61033	61033	He	97	“ Of course I will . ”
61040	61052	61033	61033	He	97	“ Did the asshole get served with his restraining order yet ? ”
61053	61081	60978	60978	She	204	“ Nope . They still ca n’t find him . I ’m trying not to feel so paranoid , but the whole situation just creeps me out . ”
61082	61088	61089	61089	he	97	“ You ’re not paranoid , ”
61092	61098	61089	61089	he	97	“ That guy is scum . ”
61193	61198	61199	61199	he	2784	“ Let ’s go , ”
61432	61450	61477	61478	a liar	1514	“ Can you take us to the corner of Front and Hudson Ave , pal ? Thanks . ”
61451	61459	61460	61460	Ari	204	“ What ’s wrong with your neck ? ”
61463	61466	61460	61460	Ari	204	“ Nothing . ”
61487	61500	61480	61480	He	2784	“ Did you see that mutual ass kicking we gave each other ? ”
61501	61510	61460	61460	Ari	204	“ I did n’t watch the whole thing . ”
61511	61514	61515	61515	She	204	“ No ? ”
61524	61534	61515	61515	She	204	“ Do n’t like to see anyone hit you . ”
61535	61552	61553	61553	He	2784	“ Aw , Ariana ! Careful , sweetheart . I might start thinking you like me . ”
61560	61572	61553	61553	He	2784	“ I do like you . Never said I did n’t . ”
61582	61601	61575	61575	her	204	“ But you do n’t want to date me . Guess I did n’t get any prettier tonight . ”
61614	61627	61610	61610	her	204	“ It ’s not you . I ’m not dating . Period . ”
61650	61665	61639	61639	He	2784	“ Are you going to come upstairs with me and look after my neck ? ”
61666	61673	61641	61641	his	2784	“ Do you need me to ? ”
61674	61677	61678	61678	He	2784	“ No . ”
61688	61695	61678	61678	He	2784	“ But I want you to . ”
61696	61702	61641	61641	his	2784	“ Are n’t you exhausted ? ”
61703	61706	61707	61707	He	2784	“ Yeah . ”
61712	61722	61707	61707	He	2784	“ Never too tired for your company , though . ”
61735	61738	61723	61723	She	204	“ Okay . ”
61739	61742	61743	61743	He	2784	“ Pal . ”
61758	61767	61743	61743	He	2784	“ Can you stop at Bridge Street instead ? ”
61768	61772	61723	61723	She	204	“ Sure thing . ”
61795	61807	61783	61783	O’Doul	97	“ If you change your mind I ’ll walk you home . ”
61828	61837	61819	61819	he	2784	“ I ’m good . Do n’t worry . ”
61851	61861	61845	61845	Ari	204	“ Who else lives in your building , anyway ? ”
61862	61871	61908	61908	He	2784	“ Hugh Major , Coach Worthington . . . ”
61872	61875	61908	61908	He	2784	“ What ? ”
61876	61900	61908	61908	He	2784	“ I ’m kidding , yogi . You clearly do n’t want to be seen with a guy who has eight new stitches . ”
61901	61904	61905	61905	she	204	“ Eight ? ”
61917	61951	61908	61908	He	2784	“ Leo and Georgia . Massey . Castro . I think that ’s it right now . This building is convenient as hell . But nobody has as short a commute as you . ”
61952	61962	61963	61963	Ari	204	“ My commute is a New Yorker ’s dream , ”
61966	62021	62022	62022	O’Doul	97	“ When I heard about this job opening up I thought I ’d never get it . Everything about it was too perfect . When Henry called to tell me I could have it if I wanted it , it was really hard not to start squealing like a preteen at her slumber party . ”
62065	62072	62073	62073	he	97	“ I ’ll get the Scotch , ”
62076	62083	62073	62073	he	97	“ You ’re in , right ? ”
62084	62087	62088	62088	she	204	“ Sure , ”
62091	62101	62102	62102	He	97	“ But let me get it . You sit . ”
62105	62117	62102	62102	He	97	“ I did n’t invite you up to wait on me . ”
62118	62143	62144	62144	She	204	“ God , I know . Just sit down already . My own neck hurts just looking at you . Your gait is off . ”
62156	62163	62144	62144	She	204	“ The Scotch is . . . ”
62164	62169	62170	62170	she	204	“ Over the refrigerator , ”
62190	62197	62198	62198	she	204	“ You have tequila , too , ”
62201	62213	62198	62198	she	204	“ Uh - huh . There are limes in the fridge . ”
62214	62223	62224	62224	she	204	“ How would you feel about a margarita ? ”
62227	62233	62224	62224	she	204	“ I do good work . ”
62234	62239	62240	62240	he	97	“ I ’m in , ”
62243	62255	62240	62240	he	97	“ If you ’re mixing it , I ’m drinking it . ”
62335	62359	62324	62324	He	97	“ Thank you , sweetheart . Are you hungry at all ? I could order something from the twenty - four hour diner . ”
62371	62381	62360	62360	He	97	“ I ’m good , but you go ahead . ”
62388	62393	62394	62394	He	97	“ Let ’s sit . ”
62400	62404	62394	62394	He	97	“ Hang on . ”
62424	62427	62410	62410	she	204	“ There . ”
62454	62465	62449	62449	She	204	“ Here ’s to the end of a shitty night . ”
62466	62478	62479	62479	He	97	“ We drink to that a lot , you and me . ”
62486	62489	62479	62479	He	97	“ Truth . ”
62500	62508	62509	62509	She	204	“ Let me work on your neck . ”
62526	62538	62539	62539	He	97	“ Put your elbows up on the back of the sofa . ”
62549	62562	62539	62539	He	97	“ This ’s just so you can reach your drink , right ? ”
62563	62566	62567	62567	She	204	“ Exactly . ”
62583	62588	62589	62589	Her	204	“ Okay , incoming . ”
62623	62633	62606	62606	she	204	“ Come on , O’Doul . Not this again . ”
62634	62637	62638	62638	He	97	“ Sorry . ”
62641	62649	62638	62638	He	97	“ I ’ll be a good boy . ”
62665	62676	62677	62677	she	204	“ I know you ca n’t stand having weak spots , ”
62680	62686	62677	62677	she	204	“ Just work with me . ”
62696	62699	62700	62700	he	97	“ Okay , ”
62813	62822	62823	62823	she	204	“ We ’ll leave it there for now , ”
62885	62889	62872	62872	He	97	“ Your turn . ”
62890	62893	62894	62894	she	204	“ Mmm , ”
62905	62950	62894	62894	she	204	“ That is nice . But I did n’t strain anything tonight . Watching hockey is n’t very tiring . And the owner ’s box has these warm Brazilian cheese puffs . I think I ate a dozen of them . . . Mmm . ”
62951	62963	62964	62964	he	97	“ What ’s it like in the box with Nate Kattenberger ? ”
62990	63089	62980	62980	Ari	204	“ It ’s great . Some nights he gets all quiet and broody , but we can never tell if it ’s the game or if he ’s busy reinventing the Internet in that big brain of his . Tonight he was in a fun mood , joking with Becca and Georgia and taking bets . We only wager pretzels , though . Georgia won the pot by guessing that Leo Trevi would be the first to score . Then she screamed her lungs out when he did . Nate says he ’s deaf in one ear now . ”
63090	63125	62980	62980	Ari	204	“ Sounds like fun . I guess I thought he ’d be all crazy intense up there . He ’s got more money invested in the team than the GDP of a developing nation . ”
63126	63131	63132	63132	Ari	204	“ He is intense , ”
63144	63181	63132	63132	Ari	204	“ About everything . But so are sports fans everywhere . Walk past any sports bar and there are guys screaming at the TV . Do you feel like Nate is more entitled to his intensity ? ”
63182	63192	63193	63193	He	1533	“ Sure he is . He signs my checks . ”
63201	63236	63193	63193	He	1533	“ We ’re all just hangin ’ by a thread , babe . It ’s not just you who worries about job security . It ’s every guy on that team . Every day . ”
63252	63262	63263	63263	he	1533	“ What else does Nate do on game night ? ”
63266	63282	63263	63263	he	1533	“ Is he superstitious ? Does he carry a rabbit ’s foot or rosary beads ? ”
63331	63380	63381	63381	O’Doul	97	“ Let ’s see . He turns off his phone during the games . Does that count ? He seems like the kind of guy who never unplugs . Oh — and he never has a drink until the third period , and only if we ’re losing . ”
63384	63391	63381	63381	O’Doul	97	“ Bottoms up tonight , then . ”
63392	63412	63413	63413	Ari	204	“ The man can drink , too . And after four Scotches he ’s still sharp as a tack . ”
63416	63424	63425	63425	He	97	“ I ’ve noticed that . Crazy . ”
63431	63442	63425	63425	He	97	“ You ’re beat . Let ’s go to sleep . ”
63443	63446	63447	63447	he	97	“ Sorry , ”
63458	63477	63447	63447	he	97	“ I ’m not a fun host . I ’ll walk you home if you want me to . ”
63478	63487	63488	63488	Ari	204	“ It ’s almost one in the morning , ”
63492	63497	63498	63498	She	204	“ Let ’s crash . ”
63534	63542	63543	63543	She	204	“ Thanks for working out my kinks . ”
63553	63563	63545	63545	her	204	“ Patrick , you are still full of them . ”
63572	63576	63577	63577	he	97	“ Leave those , ”
63588	63609	63577	63577	he	97	“ Borrow anything in the bathroom . There are probably a couple of those airplane toothbrushes in the medicine cabinet . ”
63660	63666	63667	63667	he	97	“ Good night , sweetheart , ”
63822	63827	63814	63814	She	204	“ Morning , sweetheart . ”
63828	63831	63832	63832	she	204	“ Mmm , ”
63881	63886	63887	63887	he	97	“ You sleep okay ? ”
63894	63897	63898	63898	she	204	“ Yeah , ”
63908	63911	63898	63898	she	204	“ You ? ”
63912	63917	63929	63929	he	97	“ Like a brick . ”
63918	63924	63929	63929	he	97	“ How ’s your pain ? ”
63945	63948	63952	63952	he	97	“ Ah , ”
64072	64083	64084	64084	he	97	“ Sure like waking up with you in my bed , ”
64102	64111	64090	64090	He	97	“ Touch yourself while I work your tits . ”
64138	64145	64123	64123	he	97	“ Get yourself ready for me . ”
64187	64190	64191	64191	he	97	“ Fuck , ”
64194	64198	64191	64191	he	97	“ Want you . ”
64199	64203	64204	64204	she	204	“ Have me , ”
64223	64234	64212	64212	her	204	“ But this time we ’re doing it my way . ”
64235	64239	64240	64240	He	97	“ Fair enough . ”
64264	64272	64273	64273	He	97	“ Tell me how you want me . ”
64335	64338	64339	64339	she	204	“ Mmm , ”
64342	64350	64339	64339	she	204	“ Sit up . Against the headboard . ”
64507	64515	64516	64516	she	204	“ We ’re going to go slow , ”
64519	64522	64523	64523	He	97	“ Okay . ”
64526	64534	64523	64523	He	97	“ Slower than you ’ve ever gone . ”
64535	64549	64550	64550	She	204	“ Show me , sweetheart . Wherever you lead , I ’m following . ”
64566	64573	64552	64552	her	204	“ You know what tantric is ? ”
64579	64593	64574	64574	He	97	“ Do n’t know my own name when you ’re on my cock . ”
64594	64600	64601	64601	She	204	“ Think — yoga sex . ”
64614	64619	64620	64620	she	204	“ Look at me , ”
64663	64668	64669	64669	she	204	“ Breathe with me , ”
64672	64678	64669	64669	she	204	“ I ’m breathin ’ . ”
64679	64687	64688	64688	He	97	“ Purposefully . Like in yoga class . ”
64904	64910	64899	64899	His	97	“ You like it slow . ”
64920	64923	64924	64924	she	204	“ Sometimes , ”
64927	64933	64924	64924	she	204	“ I like it all . ”
64941	64949	64950	64950	he	97	“ Go out for dinner with me , ”
64963	64967	64950	64950	he	97	“ Right now ? ”
64968	64971	64972	64972	he	97	“ No , ”
64985	65010	64972	64972	he	97	“ But I want to see more of you , and I figure right now is as good a time as any to ask . ”
65024	65031	65011	65011	He	97	“ I ’ll think about it . ”
65032	65039	65040	65040	He	97	“ She ’ll think about it . ”
65048	65063	65064	65064	He	97	“ What does a guy have to do around here to get a date ? ”
65082	65094	65064	65064	He	97	“ Is it still tantric if I play with your tits ? ”
65210	65218	65219	65219	she	204	“ You ’re very patient with me , ”
65225	65236	65219	65219	she	204	“ But I do n’t want to be patient anymore . ”
65237	65243	65244	65244	he	97	“ Enough of your way ? ”
65250	65253	65219	65219	she	204	“ Yeah . ”
65254	65261	65264	65264	he	97	“ On your back , girlie . ”
65454	65458	65459	65459	he	97	“ I swear , ”
65466	65472	65459	65459	he	97	“ gets better every time . ”
65480	65491	65492	65492	she	204	“ That ’s just because we did it my way , ”
65495	65498	65492	65492	she	204	“ Liar . ”
65509	65522	65499	65499	He	97	“ But I ’ll take you any way I can get you . ”
65528	65535	65523	65523	He	97	“ Are we late for work ? ”
65555	65568	65541	65541	He	97	“ Do n’t think so . It ’s just eight o’clock now . ”
65569	65589	65606	65606	His	97	“ Good . Because I do n’t think I could hurry anywhere right now . How ’s your face ? ”
65590	65594	65595	65595	She	204	“ What face ? ”
65598	65605	65595	65595	She	204	“ Should I ask you later ? ”
65622	65636	65614	65614	He	97	“ I got up earlier and took some ibuprofen . I feel okay . ”
65637	65643	65606	65606	His	97	“ You going to practice ? ”
65644	65659	65614	65614	He	97	“ Yeah , sure . Unless they keep me back for another concussion evaluation . ”
65668	65677	65678	65678	He	97	“ Do you think you have a concussion ? ”
65683	65696	65680	65680	his	97	“ But every time I take a beating they need to check . ”
65697	65709	65710	65710	She	204	“ I do n’t like it when you take a beating . ”
65727	65741	65719	65719	He	97	“ Is that why you wo n’t go out to dinner with me ? ”
65764	65788	65756	65756	she	204	“ I already told you why I ca n’t date . You do n’t really want to start something with me , anyway . ”
65789	65796	65797	65797	She	204	“ Yeah , I really do . ”
65802	65836	65799	65799	her	204	“ The next man who has the pleasure of starting a relationship with me is getting a cynical girl with trust issues and a ticking biological clock . How ’s that for sexy ? ”
65837	65842	65843	65843	he	97	“ Ari . . . ”
65857	65887	65843	65843	he	97	“ in the dictionary under sexy , there ’s a picture of you in the warrior pose . And — hell — nobody has more baggage than I do . ”
65888	65899	65850	65850	his	97	“ Awesome . Then we should definitely become a thing . ”
65900	65912	65913	65913	He	97	“ That ’s what I ’ve been trying to tell you . ”
65936	65949	65926	65926	She	204	“ I ’ll go out to dinner with you on one condition . ”
65950	65953	65913	65913	He	97	“ Anything . ”
65954	65973	65974	65974	He	97	“ You tell me how you started fighting , and why you do n’t like to be touched . ”
65980	65990	65974	65974	He	97	“ Why would you want to hear about that ? ”
65991	65999	66000	66000	He	97	“ Because I ’m interested in you . ”
66011	66027	66000	66000	He	97	“ It ’s not a nice story , Ari . No need to go there . ”
66028	66032	66033	66033	she	204	“ Your call , ”
66041	66051	66033	66033	she	204	“ I ’m going to use your fancy shower . ”
66064	66072	66073	66073	Castro	109	“ March , man . Fucking March . ”
66087	66111	66073	66073	Castro	109	“ It ’s the month that killed Julius Caesar , and every year I think it ’s gon na kill me , too . ”
66112	66118	66119	66119	O’Doul	97	“ Tell me about it , ”
66139	66148	66149	66149	Castro	109	“ Sixteen games in thirty - one days , ”
66160	66164	66149	66149	Castro	109	“ Batter up . ”
66182	66192	66193	66193	He	97	“ You know who are a bunch of pussies ? ”
66207	66210	66199	66199	Castro	109	“ Who ? ”
66221	66226	66227	66227	he	97	“ Football . Players , ”
66251	66257	66258	66258	he	97	“ One game a week , ”
66266	66282	66258	66258	he	97	“ And average time on the field is eleven minutes . You believe that shit ? ”
66283	66290	66291	66291	Castro	109	“ No , I do not , ”
66294	66324	66291	66291	Castro	109	“ Let ’em try to skate forty minutes in a game , three and a half nights a week . They ’d curl up in a little fucking ball . ”
66325	66329	66330	66330	O’Doul	97	“ Your turn , ”
66369	66374	66361	66361	he	97	“ Need a spot ? ”
66375	66380	66385	66385	O’Doul	97	“ I got it . ”
66381	66384	66385	66385	O’Doul	97	“ Okay . ”
66406	66412	66413	66413	He	97	“ How are you today ? ”
66423	66430	66418	66419	Nate Kattenberger	101	“ Good , sir . You ? ”
66431	66439	66446	66446	he	97	“ Can we talk for a second ? ”
66440	66443	66446	66446	he	97	“ Sure . ”
66509	66518	66519	66519	Nate	101	“ I want to show you this chart , ”
66535	66538	66539	66539	He	101	“ Okay . ”
66555	66562	66539	66539	He	101	“ What am I looking at ? ”
66563	66596	66597	66597	O’Doul	97	“ Ten years of history . Each dot is a team in a given year . They are plotted like this : injury days versus wins . Do you see the pattern ? ”
66667	66682	66656	66656	he	101	“ Okay — yeah . The teams that had more injuries have fewer wins . ”
66683	66727	66636	66636	he	101	“ Exactly . And that ’s just logical , right ? But look how strong that correlation between healthy teams and winning is . Do you think they ’re just smarter — their GMs somehow chose players that do n’t ever get injured ? ”
66728	66731	66732	66732	He	101	“ No . ”
66738	66750	66732	66732	He	101	“ They do n’t have a fucking crystal ball in Dallas . ”
66751	66754	66755	66755	Nate	101	“ Right , ”
66758	66820	66755	66755	Nate	101	“ But they ’ve realized that doing everything under the sun to keep people healthy is going to pay off . That ’s what we ’re going to do , too . I think winning more games is n’t like the sports pundits like to make it . We have the skills . We just need to keep everyone in rotation . ”
66821	66824	66825	66825	Nate	101	“ Okay . ”
66835	66848	66825	66825	Nate	101	“ That ’s why the club needs you to do less fighting . ”
66852	66870	66825	66825	Nate	101	“ That ’s a nice idea . But exactly how do you think I could avoid it ? ”
66871	66877	66878	66878	Nate	101	“ Let Crikey take some , ”
66882	66902	66878	66878	Nate	101	“ Coach asked you to , and you pushed back . I ’m asking you to stop pushing back . ”
66931	66975	66925	66925	He	101	“ But are you trying to tell me your fancy stats do n’t apply to Crikey , too ? He has n’t scrapped much up ’ til now . He could fuck up his body immediately . And every player counts , right ? ”
67000	67027	66990	66990	he	101	“ Every player counts . Of course they do . But he ’s a young kid . If he gets hurt he ’ll bounce back faster . ”
67028	67038	67041	67041	he	312	“ Is there a chart for that , too ? ”
67074	67143	67070	67070	Nate	101	“ Probably . But we do n’t need another chart to know which of you has played almost a thousand NHL games . That ’s you , not Crikey . The next ten games are going to be the most important of the year . We need experience on that ice . Do n’t sacrifice your body over some macho code . Skate more , take fewer punches . ”
67144	67151	67152	67152	O’Doul	97	“ ‘ Some macho code , ’ ”
67155	67170	67152	67152	O’Doul	97	“ Why did you buy a hockey team if you do n’t like fights ? ”
67178	67189	67190	67190	Nate	101	“ Fights are a sideshow , and you know it , ”
67201	67237	67190	67190	Nate	101	“ If they keep butts filling some of our seats , that ’s their only value to me . The game is so much bigger than fighting . And I know you agree with me . ”
67242	67255	67256	67256	Nate	101	“ In fifteen years , fighting will be gone from the NHL , ”
67259	67308	67309	67309	He	101	“ The Canadian juniors teams are already leaning away from it . Concussion research will condemn it . If you step back now , it ’s not a failure . You ’re just trendy . This is Brooklyn . Be a hipster . More yoga . Fewer stitches . ”
67321	67348	67355	67355	he	101	“ Got ta run . You and Coach had better teach Crikey a few things so we can stay in the right corner of that chart . ”
67429	67436	67437	67437	she	1561	“ I did n’t order anything , ”
67441	67452	67453	67454	the kid	353	“ If you ’re Ari , these are for you , ”
67457	67461	67453	67454	the kid	353	“ Sign here . ”
67637	67643	67644	67644	she	204	“ I just had one , ”
67650	67671	67672	67672	he	170	“ Come on back for a minute anyway . We have a couple more questions we need to ask you , ”
67675	67679	67672	67672	he	170	“ All right . ”
67698	67714	67715	67715	he	170	“ Were you able to serve your ex - boyfriend with his order of protection ? ”
67724	67742	67719	67719	She	204	“ The process server ca n’t find him . I do n’t know where he ’s staying . ”
67743	67747	67748	67749	The detective	1121	“ I see . ”
67758	67778	67748	67749	The detective	1121	“ I need to show you a document and ask you if it ’s your signature on the bottom . ”
67779	67782	67783	67783	Her	204	“ Okay ? ”
67840	67846	67821	67821	He	170	“ Does this look familiar ? ”
67888	67897	67882	67882	someone	329	“ Oh my god . What is this ? ”
67898	67910	67882	67882	someone	329	“ That ’s what I was hoping you could tell me . ”
67911	67930	67936	67937	The detective	1121	“ I certainly do n’t write checks for that amount . And I do n’t know this bank . ”
67931	67935	67936	67937	The detective	1121	“ I see . ”
67948	67969	67970	67970	Her	204	“ Would you mind filling this out , please ? In the middle section , sign your name five times . ”
67986	68003	67974	67974	she	204	“ What the hell is going on ? Why are you asking me to do this ? ”
68004	68013	68014	68014	he	1121	“ I ca n’t comment on the investigation , ”
68032	68050	68051	68051	He	1121	“ There ’s a bank account with my name on it somewhere ? What does that mean ? ”
68079	68090	68068	68068	she	204	“ Hang on — I have a few more questions . ”
68091	68095	68096	68096	she	204	“ Too bad , ”
68106	68124	68096	68096	she	204	“ I ’m going home to call my lawyer . You can clear your questions through him . ”
68249	68255	68256	68256	Patrick	97	“ Keep your chin up , ”
68259	68262	68256	68256	Patrick	97	“ Yeah . ”
68279	68309	68310	68310	Patrick	97	“ Your reach is better than mine , so stay loose and do n’t let me get near you until you ’re ready to grab the sweater . Ready ? ”
68329	68332	68333	68333	players	2858	“ Yeah ! ”
68336	68341	68333	68333	players	2858	“ You got this ! ”
68394	68404	68405	68405	Patrick	97	“ You ’re gettin ’ the hang of it , ”
68411	68418	68419	68419	Crikey	179	“ Dude . What a rush , ”
68425	68439	68419	68419	Crikey	179	“ Where ’d you learn to fight , anyway ? Who taught you ? ”
68440	68460	68422	68422	his	179	“ When I was ten I started hanging out at a boxing gym . You never heard this story ? ”
68461	68473	68474	68474	Patrick	97	“ No . Ten ? Fuck . You ’re a prodigy . ”
68488	68512	68474	68474	Patrick	97	“ Eh . It was necessary . The older kids at the group home where I lived kept stealing my food . . . ”
68517	68560	68474	68474	Patrick	97	“ . . . I hung around the boxing gym because I needed to figure out how to shut that shit down . The guys in there thought it was funny that a kid wanted to fight , so they taught me . ”
68561	68564	68565	68565	Crikey	179	“ Jesus . ”
68569	68574	68565	68565	Crikey	179	“ Did it work ? ”
68575	68599	68600	68600	He	179	“ Sure . Eventually . I ’m here now , right ? Did n’t starve . You want to go one more time ? ”
68665	68670	68671	68671	she	204	“ Is . . . ”
68676	68686	68671	68671	she	204	“ Massey ? Are you ready for your appointment ? ”
68878	68881	68875	68876	the lawyer	1598	“ Hello ? ”
68882	68885	68864	68864	She	204	“ Ariana . ”
68904	68910	68896	68896	Vince	125	“ Do n’t hang up . ”
68911	68917	68918	68918	she	204	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
68921	68946	68918	68918	she	204	“ What the hell , Vince . You got yourself mixed up in some bullshit and now the cops want to talk to me . ”
68947	68954	68955	68955	he	125	“ That will all go away , ”
68959	68971	68955	68955	he	125	“ But you have to do this one thing for me . ”
68972	68981	68918	68918	she	204	“ I do n’t have to do anything . ”
68982	69005	69006	69006	She	204	“ Yeah , you do . It will take you fifteen minutes , and you ’ll never hear from the cops again . ”
69027	69035	69017	69017	she	204	“ What is it ? No promises . ”
69036	69045	68918	68918	she	204	“ I need to get into the house . ”
69046	69060	69006	69006	She	204	“ Why ? I put all your things in the b . . . ”
69061	69088	69124	69124	his	125	“ Listen to me , girl . If you do n’t want your boyfriend ’s ass hung out to dry . You . Will . Listen . ”
69113	69120	69121	69121	Vince	125	“ We ’ll set a time , ”
69128	69161	69124	69124	his	125	“ You ’ll exit from the front door and leave it open behind you . Take a walk around the neighborhood for fifteen minutes . There ’s something I need to retrieve . ”
69169	69174	69121	69121	Vince	125	“ What is it ? ”
69175	69212	69213	69213	She	204	“ Never you mind . It ’s nothing you can find without my help . And if you touch it , everything turns to shit . I promise you do not want any part in this . ”
69216	69224	69213	69213	She	204	“ What the hell have you done ? ”
69225	69228	69229	69229	he	125	“ Nothing , ”
69233	69255	69229	69229	he	125	“ And I aim to prove it . You screw this up for me , and your boyfriend will regret it . ”
69256	69275	69213	69213	She	204	“ Do n’t threaten me . A judge gave me a restraining order with your name on it . ”
69276	69286	69287	69287	he	125	“ Leave it on the coffee table for me , ”
69290	69310	69287	69287	he	125	“ I need in there . Fifteen minutes . After eight years , you can give me fifteen minutes . ”
69311	69318	69319	69319	she	204	“ I ’ll think about it , ”
69332	69345	69323	69323	he	125	“ I do n’t have time for you to think about it . ”
69346	69357	69323	69323	he	125	“ Yeah ? I ’m done being bullied by you . ”
69661	69664	69665	69665	she	204	“ Hi , ”
69674	69685	69665	69665	she	204	“ Can I come over ? It ’s an emergency . ”
69686	69692	69693	69693	Becca	119	“ What kind of emergency ? ”
69706	69719	69693	69693	Becca	119	“ The kind that needs a margarita . Not a bail bondsman . ”
69720	69757	69665	69665	she	204	“ Whew . You had me worried there . It ’s , uh , not that relaxing here . Meet me across the street in the lobby of 220 . We ’ll go to Georgia ’s . ”
69758	69761	69770	69770	she	204	“ Okay . ”
69801	69804	69805	69805	Becca	119	“ Hey ! ”
69813	69824	69805	69805	Becca	119	“ Is this latest news going to piss me off ? ”
69825	69828	69829	69829	Becca	119	“ Probably . ”
69837	69851	69829	69829	Becca	119	“ Come on then . You can tell me while we ’re drinking . ”
69872	69881	69882	69882	she	119	“ We ’re going up to . . . ”
69899	69907	69886	69887	the doorman	919	“ Have a nice night , ladies . ”
69908	69915	69916	69916	Becca	119	“ I ’m here a lot , ”
69938	69941	69942	69942	Georgia	104	“ Hey ! ”
69956	69977	69952	69952	her	104	“ Tequila and a bakery bag ? And Becca has her pedicure satchel ? Oh , crap . Who died ? ”
69978	69986	69987	69987	Becca	119	“ Ari is having a bad day , ”
69990	70004	69987	69987	Becca	119	“ And my nephew is teething . So we came to your place . ”
70015	70031	70005	70005	She	119	“ March Madness is on , and half the team is here to watch it . ”
70032	70035	70036	70036	Becca	119	“ Fuck , ”
70039	70044	70036	70036	Becca	119	“ Well . . . ”
70073	70083	70084	70084	She	119	“ I have an idea . Come with me . ”
70107	70113	70094	70094	He	97	“ Ladies ? Everything okay ? ”
70114	70127	70128	70128	Becca	119	“ No , but Ari has n’t given us the update yet , ”
70135	70149	70128	70128	Becca	119	“ We need your apartment . You can go watch basketball with Leo . ”
70162	70192	70193	70193	His	97	“ If you were going to stay in tonight , I can drag the girls back to my place . But I did n’t want to be alone there . ”
70197	70203	70193	70193	His	97	“ Dare I ask why ? ”
70204	70212	70213	70213	Becca	119	“ Do n’t tell him before us , ”
70220	70238	70213	70213	Becca	119	“ Doulie , do you have martini glasses ? Hey — you do ! I ’m astonished . ”
70269	70297	70254	70254	Becca	119	“ Okay , Ari . Do your magic . I ’ll open the tequila . You bought the big bottle . Damn . Is it that bad ? ”
70298	70304	70305	70305	she	119	“ It ’s pretty bad , ”
70308	70317	70305	70305	she	119	“ Can you check the fridge for limes ? ”
70318	70324	70325	70325	Georgia	104	“ I ’ll do it , ”
70374	70378	70379	70379	Georgia	104	“ Found one ! ”
70382	70385	70379	70379	Georgia	104	“ Knife ? ”
70395	70399	70386	70386	Becca	119	“ Cutting board ? ”
70400	70407	70408	70408	Becca	119	“ Men never have cutting boards , ”
70411	70415	70416	70416	Patrick	97	“ Not true ! ”
70422	70426	70427	70427	Georgia	104	“ No way , ”
70443	70457	70433	70433	she	104	“ After Patrick leaves we ’re going to discuss his ridiculously civilized apartment . ”
70458	70465	70433	70433	she	104	“ Who says I ’m leaving ? ”
70466	70471	70472	70472	Becca	119	“ You can stay , ”
70475	70488	70472	70472	Becca	119	“ But everyone who stays is having his or her toenails painted . ”
70489	70492	70493	70493	he	97	“ Hmm , ”
70496	70504	70493	70493	he	97	“ That ’s not really my scene . ”
70505	70508	70509	70509	Becca	119	“ Exactly , ”
70512	70525	70526	70526	Patrick	97	“ You ’d better have four glasses out over there , though , ”
70529	70541	70526	70526	Patrick	97	“ I ’m not leaving until someone gives me a margarita . ”
70542	70546	70547	70547	Becca	119	“ Fair enough , ”
70558	70575	70547	70547	Becca	119	“ I guess you can have a drink , since we invaded your home and everything . ”
70576	70580	70581	70581	he	97	“ She guesses , ”
70629	70637	70612	70612	She	204	“ You are very patient with us . ”
70638	70646	70647	70647	he	97	“ You are very amusing to me , ”
70681	70710	70711	70711	Ari	204	“ Okay , kids . Drink up . Because I need you all nice and loose to help me guess what my douchewhistle ex has done this time . ”
70774	70790	70791	70791	Patrick	97	“ Then I just had to get out of there . Now I feel watched . ”
70830	70844	70845	70845	He	97	“ Sweetheart . Do n’t leave here before I get back , promise ? ”
70857	70863	70852	70852	his	97	“ Where are you going ? ”
70864	70881	70882	70882	He	97	“ Basketball down the hall . ‘ Cause my nails are fine the way they are . ”
70899	70909	70882	70882	He	97	“ Just do n’t go home alone , please . ”
70910	70913	70914	70914	she	204	“ Okay , ”
70963	70971	70946	70946	Georgia	104	“ Omigod . You need to spill . ”
70972	70977	70978	70978	Georgia	104	“ I just did . ”
70983	71013	70978	70978	Georgia	104	“ No , honey . Not about your ex . About Doulie . You told me — and this is a direct quote — it ’s not like that . ”
71014	71031	70946	70946	Georgia	104	“ Well , it ’s sort of like that now . I assumed Becca told you . ”
71032	71038	71039	71039	Becca	119	“ I am a vault , ”
71042	71052	71039	71039	Becca	119	“ You told me to keep my trap shut . ”
71053	71059	71060	71060	Ari	204	“ And I thank you , ”
71064	71074	71060	71060	Ari	204	“ I do n’t want the team to know . ”
71075	71083	71084	71084	Georgia	104	“ I wo n’t tell a soul , ”
71087	71110	71111	71111	Georgia	104	“ Not even Leo . But I do n’t know why you ’re so worried . The team is nice to me , ”
71115	71126	71111	71111	Georgia	104	“ Hell , I think they like me better now . ”
71127	71139	71140	71140	Ari	204	“ But you do n’t touch their naked bodies every day . ”
71163	71178	71179	71179	Becca	119	“ I do n’t want anyone imagining sex with me on the massage table . ”
71191	71217	71186	71186	herself	119	“ I hear where you ’re coming from . But maybe you should give massage table sex a try with Doulie . That sounds extraordinary . ”
71218	71222	71223	71223	Ari	204	“ It was , ”
71233	71245	71223	71223	Ari	204	“ But we did n’t do it at work . God . ”
71246	71249	71250	71250	Georgia	104	“ God , ”
71271	71283	71266	71266	Becca	119	“ Wait . What did you get up to at work ? ”
71284	71293	71294	71294	Georgia	104	“ I did n’t mean it to happen , ”
71304	71321	71294	71294	Georgia	104	“ But Leo came to find me in my office one day last week . . . ”
71322	71325	71326	71326	Becca	119	“ And ? ”
71337	71353	71329	71329	Georgia	104	“ He discovered that my office door locks . We did it on my desk . ”
71354	71357	71358	71358	Becca	119	“ Omigod . ”
71376	71387	71374	71374	herself	119	“ I ’ll never eat donuts on your desk again . ”
71388	71394	71395	71395	Georgia	104	“ We were very tidy , ”
71402	71425	71395	71395	Georgia	104	“ And anyway , we ’re getting off the topic . Is Doulie a good boyfriend ? I ’ll bet he is . ”
71426	71433	71434	71434	Ari	204	“ He ’s not my boyfriend , ”
71437	71459	71434	71434	Ari	204	“ I ca n’t have one of those right now . I think I need to remember how to be alone . ”
71460	71464	71465	71465	Becca	119	“ I remember ! ”
71472	71491	71465	71465	Becca	119	“ And it blows . So forgive me if I do n’t think your argument holds any water . ”
71492	71537	71434	71434	Ari	204	“ Even if I wanted to date someone right now , I do n’t think we ’re a good fit . I always fall for the bossy macho men , and then I ca n’t figure out why they want to control my life . ”
71538	71542	71543	71543	Georgia	104	“ Hang on , ”
71559	71578	71543	71543	Georgia	104	“ Macho can take many forms . They are n’t all bad . Does Doulie push you around ? ”
71584	71591	71581	71581	her	204	“ He ’s bossy , though . ”
71604	71640	71641	71641	She	204	“ Ugh . He should n’t press me for a relationship , anyway . I ’m a freaking wreck . My ex is trying to break into my home , and even worse . . . ”
71654	71664	71665	71665	Becca	119	“ What could be worse than a violent ex ? ”
71668	71684	71665	71665	Becca	119	“ I mean , seriously . You ’ve got no place to go but up . ”
71685	71688	71689	71689	Georgia	104	“ Bec ! ”
71692	71697	71689	71689	Georgia	104	“ Everyone makes mistakes . ”
71704	71714	71715	71715	she	104	“ I ca n’t afford to make another mistake , ”
71718	71737	71715	71715	she	104	“ Because I want a child . And Patrick told me once that he ’s never having kids . ”
71801	71830	71796	71796	Georgia	104	“ Maybe it ’s time to move on to the nail - painting portion of the evening . Before we ’re too drunk to do a good job . ”
71831	71835	71836	71836	Becca	119	“ Good call . ”
71843	71851	71852	71852	She	119	“ I ’ll set up the footbath . ”
71862	71874	71875	71875	Georgia	104	“ Let ’s pull the coffee table out of the way , ”
71878	71885	71875	71875	Georgia	104	“ We need the whole rug . ”
71899	71907	71893	71893	Ari	204	“ Hey — I have baked goodies . ”
71908	71911	71912	71912	Becca	119	“ Yesss ! ”
71915	71927	71912	71912	Becca	119	“ Let me guess — whoopie pies from One Girl Cookies ? ”
71928	71934	71935	71935	Becca	119	“ How did you know ? ”
71941	71948	71935	71935	Becca	119	“ I may have been consulted . ”
71949	71954	71955	71955	Ari	204	“ You helped him ? ”
71958	71963	71964	71964	Becca	119	“ Who would n’t ? ”
71981	72001	72002	72002	Georgia	104	“ He ’s adorable . You know — in a really rugged , panty - ripping kind of way . ”
72010	72041	72002	72002	Georgia	104	“ Take off your shoes , Ari . You ’re going first . Becca ’s theory is that everyone thinks better with her feet in a tub of warm water . ”
72060	72077	72047	72047	She	204	“ Oh — and Becca likes to choose the polish . She ’s bossy like that . ”
72078	72085	72086	72086	Becca	119	“ Only for you , sweetie , ”
72110	72122	72086	72086	Becca	119	“ Because you are n’t vain enough to get it right . ”
72123	72128	72129	72129	Georgia	104	“ Well , damn , ”
72132	72172	72129	72129	Georgia	104	“ Just for that I ’m going to warn Ari that you screw with the travel reservations sometimes . Do n’t be too shocked if Doulie ends up in the adjoining room when you go to Ottawa tomorrow morning . ”
72185	72188	72189	72189	she	204	“ Omigod ! ”
72204	72212	72213	72213	Becca	119	“ That was your doing in Raleigh ? ”
72224	72229	72213	72213	Becca	119	“ Did it work ? ”
72230	72240	72241	72241	Ari	204	“ Good lord . Hottest night of my life , ”
72268	72273	72274	72274	Becca	119	“ You ’re blushing , ”
72278	72284	72274	72274	Becca	119	“ You would , too . ”
72289	72305	72274	72274	Becca	119	“ Always the wingman , never the target . Somebody better make me another margarita . ”
72306	72312	72313	72313	Georgia	104	“ I ’m on it , ”
72325	72344	72316	72316	Ari	204	“ We still have to figure out what Vince left in my apartment . What could it be ? ”
72345	72351	72352	72352	Becca	119	“ His heart , honey , ”
72356	72377	72352	72352	Becca	119	“ I think he ’s just jealous . Sometimes men do n’t know what they have until it ’s gone . ”
72385	72415	72378	72378	Ari	204	“ That ’s a nice idea , but I think he ’s serious . I ’m going to have to go to the police again , are n’t I ? ”
72416	72419	72420	72420	Becca	119	“ Probably , ”
72423	72447	72420	72420	Becca	119	“ I ’ll go with you if you want . But tomorrow we ’re going to Ottawa , so you have a reprieve . ”
72448	72455	72456	72456	Georgia	104	“ And your drink is ready ! ”
72512	72522	72523	72523	Castro	109	“ This is our captain on his night off , ”
72526	72538	72523	72523	Castro	109	“ He probably wears a silk smoking jacket around the house . ”
72539	72546	72547	72548	Zac Sullivan	136	“ What ’s a smoking jacket ? ”
72551	72557	72547	72548	Zac Sullivan	136	“ Maybe I need one . ”
72646	72651	72652	72652	he	97	“ Who ’s winning ? ”
72657	72660	72661	72661	someone	329	“ Louisville , ”
72667	72676	72661	72661	someone	329	“ We ’re all losing our bets tonight . ”
72677	72685	72686	72686	O’Doul	97	“ You ca n’t all be losing , ”
72690	72698	72686	72686	O’Doul	97	“ Who has Louisville in the bracket ? ”
72699	72703	72704	72704	Castro	109	“ The kitty ! ”
72707	72758	72759	72759	Hysterical	208	“ The charity kitty has Louisville . I think Jimbo put that in , the little smartass . It sucks because the winner is supposed to buy us drinks after the Final Four ! You ’ll never let us dip into the kitty for drink money . I know this . ”
72761	72785	72759	72759	Hysterical	208	“ Buy your own damn drinks , asshole . You ’re pullin ’ down more money than most people can make in years . ”
72786	72795	72796	72796	Castro	109	“ It ’s the principle of the thing , ”
72808	72817	72796	72796	Castro	109	“ The principle of the thing , huh ? ”
72821	72834	72796	72796	Castro	109	“ Put twenty bucks into the kitty just for being a boob . ”
72835	72838	72839	72839	He	97	“ Fuck . ”
72845	72851	72839	72839	He	97	“ Who do I pay ? ”
72852	72861	72796	72796	Castro	109	“ I ’ll tell Jimbo you owe him . ”
72862	72871	72872	72872	Beringer	113	“ What ’s in your glass , captain ? ”
72875	72882	72872	72872	Beringer	113	“ Does n’t look like Scotch . ”
72883	72893	72796	72796	Castro	109	“ Maybe a lady friend made it for me . ”
72899	72902	72796	72796	Castro	109	“ whoa ! ”
72908	72918	72919	72919	Leo	110	“ So it ’s all working out for you ? ”
72922	72931	72919	72919	Leo	110	“ Do we ever get to meet her ? ”
72932	72935	72936	72936	O’Doul	97	“ Dunno , ”
72987	73002	72973	72973	he	97	“ Your bakery thing was a hit . They even delivered it for me . ”
73003	73012	73013	73013	Leo	110	“ Never underestimate the power of baked goods , ”
73021	73032	73033	73033	he	110	“ My next ploy will be Jimbo ’s birthstone thing , ”
73040	73059	73033	73033	he	110	“ Found something , but it took a while . There is some fugly jewelry in the world . ”
73060	73071	73072	73072	Castro	109	“ Next time , ask a chick where to shop , ”
73075	73107	73072	73072	Castro	109	“ Who has nice taste ? Georgia , of course , but she does n’t seem like a shopper . Rebecca , maybe . Or — I know — ask Ari . ”
73112	73118	73119	73119	Leo	110	“ Or how about Lauren ? ”
73122	73130	73119	73119	Leo	110	“ She ’s always dressed to kill . ”
73131	73141	73142	73142	Castro	109	“ With Lauren , that ’s not a metaphor , ”
73145	73170	73142	73142	Castro	109	“ Say the wrong thing to that chick and she ’ll cut your balls right off . No sense of humor on that girl . ”
73197	73200	73194	73194	her	132	“ Hey , ”
73217	73225	73194	73194	her	132	“ Castro , I need that ottoman . ”
73226	73233	73201	73201	O’Doul	97	“ My feet need this ottoman . ”
73234	73251	73252	73252	Castro	109	“ It ’s either that or we ’re snuggling together on your part of the couch . ”
73263	73279	73252	73252	Castro	109	“ Take it . I do n’t want a love triangle with your lady friend . ”
73280	73285	73286	73286	He	97	“ What a gentleman . ”
73320	73325	73326	73326	Georgia	104	“ That is bullshit , ”
73329	73340	73326	73326	Georgia	104	“ Matt Damon is so much hotter than Ben Affleck . ”
73341	73352	73353	73353	Ariana	98	“ He ca n’t pull off a beard , though , ”
73356	73360	73353	73353	Ariana	98	“ Admit it . ”
73361	73366	73367	73367	Becca	119	“ Or a ponytail , ”
73382	73390	73370	73370	He	97	“ Hi , ladies . Miss me ? ”
73457	73460	73461	73461	Ari	204	“ Hey . ”
73466	73469	73461	73461	Ari	204	“ Whoa . ”
73483	73493	73476	73476	she	204	“ Wow . We had a lot of tequila . ”
73494	73497	73498	73498	Becca	119	“ Indeed ! ”
73504	73517	73498	73498	Becca	119	“ Ran out of margarita mix . Had to do some shots . ”
73529	73536	73498	73498	Becca	119	“ And how ’d that go ? ”
73537	73541	73542	73542	Georgia	104	“ Pretty good ! ”
73548	73560	73542	73542	Georgia	104	“ But I ca n’t really feel my face right now . ”
73561	73566	73567	73567	he	97	“ Is that right ? ”
73587	73604	73605	73605	She	204	“ I think I can get up by myself . Let ’s give it a try . ”
73616	73623	73605	73605	She	204	“ So far , so good . ”
73645	73661	73633	73633	She	119	“ Come on , babe . Let ’s pour you back into your own apartment . ”
73662	73665	73666	73666	Georgia	104	“ M’kay . ”
73672	73687	73688	73688	Becca	119	“ Come over here and hold onto the door while I get my stuff , ”
73698	73705	73688	73688	Becca	119	“ I can walk her home , ”
73709	73715	73688	73688	Becca	119	“ And you , too . ”
73716	73721	73722	73722	Becca	119	“ We ’re fine ! ”
73737	73740	73726	73726	She	119	“ Whoops ! ”
73741	73750	73751	73751	Ari	204	“ Do n’t worry about the . . . ”
73768	73773	73751	73751	Ari	204	“ I got those . ”
73836	73841	73842	73842	she	204	“ I ’m drunk , ”
73851	73861	73842	73842	she	204	“ I know , baby . It ’s okay . ”
73862	73873	73920	73920	he	97	“ I ’ve had more drinks this month than in the last”—she
73876	73878	73842	73842	she	204	hiccup—“year . ”
73879	73884	73885	73885	he	97	“ Is that bad ? ”
73898	73910	73885	73885	he	97	“ Maybe ? I think my chakras are out of alignment . ”
73911	73919	73920	73920	he	97	“ You can work on that tomorrow , ”
73923	73931	73920	73920	he	97	“ Let ’s put you to bed . ”
73932	73952	73953	73953	He	97	“ I brought a toothbrush in my purse . I thought I was going to crash at Becca ’s . ”
73989	73995	73996	73996	she	204	“ I can do this , ”
74003	74014	73996	73996	she	204	“ Please do n’t fall down and hit your head . ”
74022	74033	74034	74034	Women	1406	“ You do sometimes . They pay you for it . ”
74045	74065	74036	74036	They	1406	“ Just humor me and stay vertical . I ’ll find you a T - shirt to sleep in . ”
74087	74090	74091	74091	he	97	“ Here , ”
74104	74118	74091	74091	he	97	“ Do you think you could take this ? How ’s your stomach ? ”
74119	74122	74123	74123	she	204	“ Fine , ”
74126	74130	74123	74123	she	204	“ Thank you . ”
74146	74153	74154	74154	he	97	“ Let ’s get this off , ”
74164	74167	74168	74168	she	204	“ Mmm , ”
74206	74211	74212	74212	he	97	“ There you go , ”
74220	74225	74212	74212	he	97	“ Hop in there . ”
74253	74258	74241	74241	He	97	“ Come to bed ? ”
74259	74265	74266	74266	He	97	“ In a few minutes . ”
74349	74355	74356	74356	she	204	“ The room is spinning , ”
74359	74364	74365	74365	he	97	“ I got you , ”
74383	74392	74393	74393	she	204	“ Not supposed to like you so much , ”
74396	74401	74402	74402	he	97	“ Uh - huh , ”
74405	74417	74402	74402	he	97	“ Tough luck , because I ’d be an awesome date . ”
74418	74422	74423	74423	she	204	“ So humble , ”
74431	74442	74423	74423	she	204	“ Thanks for letting us get sloppy on your parket . ”
74447	74452	74443	74443	She	204	“ I mean carpet . ”
74453	74458	74459	74459	He	97	“ Totally worth it . ”
74473	74484	74459	74459	He	97	“ You girls are very entertaining when you ’re drunk . ”
74485	74494	74495	74495	she	204	“ Do n’t know why you like me , ”
74498	74508	74495	74495	she	204	“ I ’m a pain in the gluteus maximus . ”
74551	74558	74559	74559	he	97	“ You ’re not so bad , ”
74566	74584	74559	74559	he	97	“ It was not a good day . I have to hire the lawyer for more hours . ”
74585	74592	74559	74559	he	97	“ I ’m sorry , baby . ”
74593	74612	74613	74613	He	97	“ I should have become a lawyer . Two hours of private massage equals one hour of lawyering . ”
74618	74635	74613	74613	He	97	“ But then you ’d only live half as long because lawyering sounds boring as shit . ”
74653	74664	74650	74650	She	204	“ I do n’t know if lawyering is a word . ”
74665	74677	74678	74678	Ari	204	“ It is when you ’ve drunk a lot of tequila . ”
74705	74717	74701	74701	she	204	“ I heard you telling Crikey how you learned to fight . ”
74727	74737	74718	74718	His	97	“ Yeah . It was a long time ago . ”
74738	74744	74745	74745	He	97	“ Where were your parents ? ”
74766	74787	74757	74757	he	97	“ Just tell me , Patrick . You want me to trust you , but everything is on your terms . ”
74801	74845	74790	74790	She	204	“ You know , you ’re the only one who calls me Patrick since my mother died . Since you want to know so bad , I was eight when it happened . I watched my father shoot my mother in the head . ”
74846	74851	74852	74852	Ari	204	“ Oh my god . ”
74897	75005	74877	74877	He	1685	“ Obviously my father went to prison . I went into the state ’s care . For a couple of years they found foster homes for me . But foster parents are usually people without a lot of stability , too . When I was ten they sent me to a group home , and it was a disaster . I was the youngest kid there . Never got enough to eat because the teenagers would take my food , my school supplies . Once they sold my shoes to buy beer . I started trying to fight back but they outweighed me by a hundred pounds . ”
75053	75194	75207	75207	her	204	“ That ’s when I found that boxing gym in the neighborhood . I passed it every day after school . I started staring into the window watching these guys train . And I was just a kid who had nothing to lose , so I started imitating them — right there on the sidewalk . I ’d shadowbox in front of the plateglass window . They must have thought it was hysterical . So after this goes on for a while the owner invites me inside . His name is Rick , and he ’s got tattoos covering like ninety percent of his body . I thought he was so big and scary and so badass . I wanted to be just like him so I could scare the shit out of the guys who keep taking my stuff . ”
75216	75298	75207	75207	her	204	“ ‘ What are you doing , kid ? ’ they asked me . ‘ Do you have to train for a fight ? ’ So I told them yes . And Rick asked , ‘ When ’s your fight , kid ? ’ And I said , ‘ Every morning at breakfast and every night at dinner , but lunches are at school and the big kids ca n’t steal my lunch except for Saturday and Sunday . . . ’ ”
75323	75360	75361	75361	Ari	204	“ . . . So , anyway , Rick put some protective gear on me and let me kick off my shoes and get into the ring . And I just about pissed myself with glee . ”
75370	75503	75363	75363	her	204	“ Those guys taught me to fight for real . How to punch , and how to keep my head up , and how to move . I went there every day and they did n’t kick me out . I did n’t always get time in the ring , but there were bags to hit , and people standing around to tell me what to do . And then I decided I ’d learned a lot , right ? So one night when this high school kid decided he was going to eat my piece of meatloaf I socked him right in the eye . He still weighed twice as much as I did , so he picked me up and threw me into the bookcase face - first . . . ”
75510	75584	75504	75504	He	1689	“ I had bruises all over my face and a broken tooth . When I went to the gym the next day , the guys were so fucking mad . They wanted me to tell them who did it , but I was afraid to rat the guy out . So they started teaching me to fight dirty . How to stomp on feet and pull ears and knee somebody in the nuts . “
75743	75749	75721	75721	They	2681	” He cleared his throat . “
75760	75796	75757	75757	you	0	” He waited for her to say something . But maybe it would be better if she did n’t . If she fell asleep right now , she might not even remember this conversation tomorrow . “
75810	75815	75757	75757	you	0	” Ari said quietly . “
75827	75828	75819	75819	you	0	” “
75831	75835	75819	75819	you	0	” he admitted . “
75893	75911	75885	75886	Every kid	1699	” She slid a hand clumsily up his chest , onto his neck , cupping his jaw . “
75932	75943	75920	75920	I	0	” That awkward endorsement made him grin into the darkness . “
75958	75959	75960	75960	We	1701	” “
75964	75965	75960	75960	We	1701	” “
75974	75987	75968	75970	a tough sell	1702	” He removed her hand from his face and kissed her palm . “
76014	76027	76012	76012	me	0	” She did n’t , though . Ari had finally fallen to sleep .
76073	76079	76080	76080	she	204	“ Just kill me already , ”
76087	76099	76080	76080	she	204	“ How about I buy you a bagel and coffee instead ? ”
76128	76135	76136	76136	she	204	“ I ’m never drinking again , ”
76142	76152	76153	76153	he	97	“ You ’re hot even when you ’re hungover , ”
76249	76255	76256	76256	Georgia	104	“ Does your head ache ? ”
76267	76273	76256	76256	Georgia	104	“ Mine is killing me . ”
76274	76279	76280	76280	Ari	204	“ We overdid it , ”
76283	76294	76295	76295	she	204	“ Thanks for helping me drown my sorrows , though , ”
76311	76318	76295	76295	she	204	“ Who ’s he talking to ? ”
76319	76339	76295	76295	she	204	“ His mom . And we ca n’t leave for another minute , because we ’re waiting for Becca . ”
76340	76354	76295	76295	she	204	“ Really ? I did n’t know she was coming on this trip . ”
76355	76359	76360	76360	Georgia	104	“ Me neither , ”
76372	76398	76399	76399	Ari	204	“ But she sent me a text ninety minutes ago asking if she could bum a ride with us . So Leo upgraded the car . ”
76404	76421	76399	76399	Ari	204	“ Nice . If my head were n’t killing me , I ’d enjoy the trip . ”
76422	76435	76436	76436	Leo	110	“ Why ’d you girls get so lit last night , anyway ? ”
76443	76450	76451	76451	Georgia	104	“ Ari had a bad day , ”
76454	76463	76464	76464	Becca	119	“ I ’m here ! We can leave , ”
76500	76508	76509	76509	he	110	“ We ’re ready when you are , ”
76512	76517	76509	76509	he	110	“ Yes , sir . ”
76549	76555	76556	76556	she	104	“ How ’s your head ? ”
76560	76566	76556	76556	she	104	“ Never better . Why ? ”
76575	76605	76567	76567	Georgia	104	“ Just ignore her . She ’s one of those people who does n’t get hungover . Why are you going to Ottawa with us , anyway , Bec ? ”
76612	76723	76606	76606	Becca	119	“ Nate decided to go last minute , since he ’s all stressed out about making the play - offs . And I had a total panic attack , because my sister has a midterm exam today , and I ’d already told her I ’d stay home with the baby . My nephew ca n’t go to daycare because he had a fever last night , and they make you wait twenty - four hours . Or something . I do n’t know . But I was supposed to babysit , and then Nathan called and said , ‘ pack a bag . ’ So I did the unthinkable . ”
76724	76729	76730	76730	Ari	204	“ What ’s that ? ”
76733	76749	76730	76730	Ari	204	“ I called Queen Lauren and asked her to go to Ottawa in my place . ”
76750	76760	76761	76761	Georgia	104	“ She ’d never agree to that , right ? ”
76764	76772	76761	76761	Georgia	104	“ She hates traveling with the team . ”
76773	76846	76730	76730	Ari	204	“ I know , but she hates failing Nathan more . I really did n’t want to owe her a favor , because she ’ll lord it over me . But I did n’t want my sister to miss her test . So I told Lauren why I was in a bind . Since Lauren is getting a business degree at night school , I knew she ’d understand about the test . ”
76847	76852	76853	76853	Georgia	104	“ Wait , really ? ”
76856	76875	76853	76853	Georgia	104	“ She ’s getting a degree while she works for Nathan ? Where does she find the time ? ”
76876	76882	76883	76883	Becca	119	“ I know , right ? ”
76895	76927	76883	76883	Becca	119	“ She clearly is not as caught up on the trashy TV shows as we are . But she understood my issue , although her solution was not what I predicted . ”
76928	76933	76934	76934	Georgia	104	“ What was it ? ”
76937	76955	76934	76934	Georgia	104	“ Let me guess — she hired some fancy nanny service to come and stay with Matthew ? ”
76956	76959	76960	76960	Becca	119	“ Nope ! ”
76963	76978	76960	76960	Becca	119	“ Lauren is in my apartment right now taking care of the baby herself . ”
76993	76996	76997	76997	Georgia	104	“ Seriously ? ”
77005	77017	76997	76997	Georgia	104	“ You left your nephew in the care of Queen Lauren ? ”
77018	77036	77037	77037	Georgia	104	“ I did . He looked very happy , though . They were cooing at each other . ”
77042	77073	77039	77039	her	104	“ Do you have a photo ? I ca n’t reconcile the idea of Lauren in her Chanel suit holding a drooly baby . And no offense but . . . ”
77074	77122	76997	76997	Georgia	104	“ . . . He drools like a fire hose . Trust me , I know . And , yeah . I think she likes babies . After they ’d bonded for a moment she looked up at me with that Lauren face and basically dismissed me . ”
77123	77126	77127	77127	Georgia	104	“ Whoa , ”
77130	77133	77127	77127	Georgia	104	“ Fascinating . ”
77134	77173	77174	77174	Leo	110	“ I know ! My sister is going to come home in an hour and say , ‘ who the hell are you ? ’ So now I ’ll owe Lauren and my sister . What a week . ”
77180	77193	77194	77194	He	110	“ Nate is freaked about our play - offs chances ? Great . ”
77206	77230	77194	77194	He	110	“ So am I , then . Coach switched up the lines again last night . I wondered if Nate was pressuring him . ”
77231	77241	77242	77242	Georgia	104	“ Dad would n’t take coaching tips from Nate , ”
77246	77252	77242	77242	Georgia	104	“ That ’s just weird . ”
77253	77258	77259	77259	Becca	119	“ I hear you , ”
77262	77284	77259	77259	Becca	119	“ But Nate has this way of arguing a point until you ’re either won over or ready to kill him . ”
77285	77292	77293	77293	Georgia	104	“ Nate ’s not so bad , ”
77296	77322	77293	77293	Georgia	104	“ I like the guy . I can never tell what he thinks of me , but my gut says he ’s a good man . ”
77323	77330	77331	77331	Becca	119	“ He is a good man , ”
77334	77418	77331	77331	Becca	119	“ As long as you like ’em wildly opinionated , stubborn as a mule , and really smug . Even as I ’m saying this , I ’m pretty sure I ’d lay down in the road for him . The thing about Nate is that he understands where everyone ’s boundaries lie . It ’s like — he has godlike abilities but he understands that it ’s special , and he can come down to your level and work with you anyway . ”
77436	77454	77425	77425	she	204	“ Do n’t sell yourself short , Bec . The way you handle tequila is rather extraordinary . ”
77455	77464	77465	77465	she	204	“ If only it were a marketable skill , ”
77468	77479	77465	77465	she	204	“ I could really use some extra cash right now . ”
77543	77548	77549	77549	Patrick	97	“ Hey , Ari . ”
77554	77559	77549	77549	Patrick	97	“ How are you ? ”
77587	77592	77593	77593	she	204	“ Afternoon , Patrick , ”
77596	77614	77593	77593	she	204	“ I ’d like to say that I ’m fine , but my head is killing me . ”
77620	77632	77615	77615	His	97	“ Did you go out drinking last night , Miss Bettini ? ”
77633	77643	77644	77644	He	97	“ I did . And I learned my lesson . ”
77649	77659	77644	77644	He	97	“ Want an aspirin ? I always carry them . ”
77660	77667	77668	77668	she	204	“ I have some with me , ”
77671	77694	77668	77668	she	204	“ But can I leave my carry - on with you for a second ? I need to refill my water bottle . ”
77695	77699	77700	77700	She	204	“ Of course . ”
77783	77787	77788	77788	he	97	“ All set ? ”
77791	77797	77788	77788	he	97	“ Yes , thank you . ”
77859	77869	77870	77870	Becca	119	“ You do not have the entire play memorized , ”
77873	77903	77870	77870	Becca	119	“ Do so ! Since the ninth grade . I was a kick - ass Romeo . Which bit do you want to hear ? I ’ll prove it . ”
77904	77911	77959	77959	his	109	“ Fine . The balcony scene . ”
77912	77919	77920	77920	Castro	109	“ Act II , scene II . ”
77925	77937	77922	77922	his	109	“ Everyone picks that bit . I ’m bored of it . ”
77938	77947	77959	77959	his	109	“ Maybe you do n’t really know it . ”
77948	77956	77957	77957	He	109	“ Girl , I do ! Listen . ”
77962	77985	77959	77959	his	109	“ But , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? It is the east , and Rebecca is the sun . ”
77986	77991	77992	77992	she	119	“ Oh , lordy , ”
77997	78061	78062	78062	He	109	“ Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , That thou , her maid , art far more fair than she . Be not her maid , since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it ; cast it off . ”
78072	78085	78062	78062	He	109	“ It is my lady , O , it is my love ! ”
78086	78089	78090	78090	Becca	119	“ Wow , ”
78093	78106	78090	78090	Becca	119	“ You must have made all the ninth - grade girls swoon . ”
78107	78114	78062	78062	He	109	“ That ’s right , baby . ”
78115	78118	78062	78062	He	109	“ Rebecca , ”
78146	78149	78150	78150	she	119	“ What ? ”
78193	78215	78220	78220	he	101	“ Bring this month ’s attendance numbers back to the conference table , please . We ’ll start in two minutes . ”
78224	78227	78228	78228	Georgia	104	“ Yikes , ”
78234	78243	78244	78244	Castro	109	“ What crawled up his ass and died ? ”
78533	78536	78537	78537	she	204	“ Sir ? ”
78540	78547	78537	78537	she	204	“ Do you have a minute ? ”
78563	78572	78559	78559	Hugh	150	“ How can I help you , Ari ? ”
78581	78596	78559	78559	Hugh	150	“ You said I should tell you if I had any more security issues . ”
78597	78600	78601	78601	he	150	“ Yeah , ”
78604	78610	78601	78601	he	150	“ I want to know . ”
78611	78616	78617	78617	She	204	“ Well . . . ”
78622	78651	78652	78652	She	204	“ My ex - boyfriend is demanding access to my home , claiming he left something behind . And I really do n’t like the sound of it . ”
78666	78710	78711	78711	Hugh	150	“ I wonder if your security guys could refer me to a private investigator . My lawyer suggested it , and I did n’t want to listen . But now I think I just need to know what he ’s involved me with . ”
78714	78726	78711	78711	Hugh	150	“ Right . I ’ve already green - lit an investigation . ”
78727	78735	78652	78652	She	204	“ You ’ve . . . what ? ”
78736	78761	78762	78762	He	125	“ I ’ve already asked the PI we use to look into it . That picture he sent to Patrick was awfully . . . ”
78767	78829	78762	78762	He	125	“ Personal . I decided it was n’t going to go away on its own . So my team is looking into the perpetrator . I ’ll call them when we land and see what the PI turned up . We can set up a meeting for later this week . We ’ll all sit down and have a status update . ”
78880	78894	78870	78870	She	204	“ Thank you , sir . I sure am sorry that ’s necessary . ”
78895	78935	78936	78936	He	150	“ Me , too , Ariana . It ’s a shame you ’re dealing with this . I wish all my team members had trouble - free lives as the play - offs approach . And yet . . . ”
78939	78969	78936	78936	He	150	“ I ’ve been doing this twenty - five years , and have n’t had an easy season yet . You ’d think I ’d get used to it . ”
78987	78993	78970	78970	She	204	“ Thank you , sir . ”
78994	79005	79006	79006	he	150	“ We ’ll talk more after I hear from them , ”
79100	79105	79106	79106	Georgia	104	“ What ’s that ? ”
79115	79121	79106	79106	Georgia	104	“ I do n’t know . ”
79178	79181	79182	79182	Georgia	104	“ Pretty ! ”
79185	79199	79182	79182	Georgia	104	“ That ’s so . . . you . Is that a note ? ”
79242	79245	79246	79246	Georgia	104	“ Aw , ”
79249	79255	79246	79246	Georgia	104	“ Somebody really likes you . ”
79256	79262	79263	79263	Ari	204	“ It ’s awfully nice , ”
79298	79307	79285	79285	her	204	“ He makes it hard to stay single . ”
79308	79312	79313	79313	Georgia	104	“ No comment , ”
79322	79352	79319	79319	her	104	“ But let ’s put that on your chain , because it will look nice there . Here , turn your head . I ’ll take it off you . ”
79364	79369	79370	79370	she	204	“ I ca n’t , ”
79373	79377	79370	79370	she	204	“ Why not ? ”
79384	79432	79378	79378	She	204	“ He ’s great , and I really like him . And all the things he ’s done for me are so sweet . But my life is a mess right now , and I ’m giving him mixed signals . I have to cut that out . ”
79439	79467	79433	79433	Georgia	104	“ I think you guys would be really great together . And I ’ve never seen Doulie go after someone before . I think he really cares . ”
79474	79482	79433	79433	Georgia	104	“ He asked you out , right ? ”
79483	79497	79498	79498	Georgia	104	“ Once . Barely . But I ’ve never seen him like this . ”
79507	79539	79498	79498	Georgia	104	“ And forget the present . The way he looks at you is so sweet . He ’s softer when you ’re around . Like his rough edges are worn away . ”
80234	80243	80244	80244	He	138	“ Bayer . Beacon . Trevi . . . ”
80261	80264	80265	80265	He	138	“ O’Doul . ”
80435	80443	80444	80445	Hugh Major	150	“ Where ’s your suit and tie ? ”
80468	80475	80476	80476	he	138	“ I do n’t have one , ”
80522	80524	80502	80503	the salesman	1789	“ Break ”
80526	80528	80502	80503	the salesman	1789	“ spread ”
80530	80534	80535	80535	He	138	“ flat front . ”
80690	80693	80694	80694	Ari	204	“ Patrick ? ”
80712	80715	80716	80716	He	138	“ Ari ? ”
80729	80740	80726	80726	she	204	“ Hi , sweetheart . You ’re my neighbor again . ”
80741	80752	80753	80753	she	204	“ Becca has fun deciding who ’s next to whom , ”
80762	80772	80753	80753	she	204	“ Can I talk to you for a second ? ”
80779	80783	80784	80784	He	138	“ Of course . ”
80822	80827	80828	80828	she	204	“ This is beautiful , ”
80839	80872	80828	80828	she	204	“ But I ca n’t take it . When I told you that I could n’t be in a relationship right now , I was n’t kidding . My life is messy . ”
80873	80879	80880	80880	He	138	“ I know , baby . ”
80916	80922	80923	80923	he	138	“ Sit down a second , ”
80929	80932	80933	80933	He	138	“ Okay . ”
80974	81024	80969	80969	He	138	“ This is n’t a fancy piece of jewelry . I was n’t trying to buy your affection . It ’s your birthstone , and it was just a gimmicky way to show you that I was paying attention . It does n’t have to be a big deal . ”
81038	81065	81034	81034	she	204	“ It ’s the classiest gift I ’ve ever gotten . But I already knew you were paying attention . You show me that every day . ”
81070	81098	81066	81066	She	204	“ The thing is , what I really need in my life right now is not a relationship , but a friend . Can you be that ? ”
81173	81184	81162	81162	he	138	“ I care about you too much to say no . ”
81185	81189	81190	81190	She	204	“ Thank you . ”
81202	81207	81197	81197	her	204	“ I ’m sorry . ”
81208	81229	81162	81162	he	138	“ Do n’t you be sorry . I ’m a big boy . But can you do me a favor ? ”
81230	81233	81162	81162	he	138	“ What ? ”
81234	81246	81197	81197	her	204	“ Keep the pendant , unless you do n’t like it . ”
81247	81252	81162	81162	he	138	“ I love it . ”
81253	81315	81316	81316	She	204	“ Then wear it sometimes , and remember that your birthday is coming . Because by the time August rolls around , I ’m betting a whole lot of the bullshit in your life will be finished . You ’ll be out to dinner with your girlfriends and thinking , hell , that year sucked . But things are looking up . ”
81322	81348	81316	81316	She	204	“ God , I hope so . I ’ll be thirty — a new decade . One where I do n’t cohabitate with any criminals . ”
81349	81355	81356	81356	She	204	“ Aim high , honey . ”
81383	81390	81366	81366	Ari	204	“ You always cheer me up . ”
81391	81397	81398	81398	He	138	“ Back atcha , babe . ”
81405	81418	81419	81419	She	204	“ Here . Wear it in good health . Start the countdown . ”
81429	81458	81459	81459	She	204	“ You ’ve got . . . four or five months until the big three oh . That seems like enough time to let it all blow over . ”
81484	81491	81473	81473	she	204	“ Would you . . . ? ”
81492	81495	81496	81496	She	204	“ Sure . ”
81558	81581	81553	81553	He	138	“ We should get downstairs . Dinner will start soon . It ’s in that fancy dining room with the curved ceiling . ”
81590	81621	81582	81582	Ari	204	“ You say that like other people would say , dinner will be served from the garbage can in the subway station . What do you have against the Chateau ? ”
81622	81625	81626	81626	He	138	“ Eh . ”
81638	81643	81644	81644	He	138	“ It ’s stuffy . ”
81675	81679	81680	81680	she	204	“ Thank you , ”
81765	81784	81733	81733	He	138	“ You ’re welcome . Now let ’s go eat rich food and rub elbows with the owner . ”
81805	81810	81811	81811	Beacon	164	“ I ’m starving , ”
81814	81824	81811	81811	Beacon	164	“ They ’re not quite ready to seat us . ”
81825	81830	81831	81831	Castro	109	“ Hey , guys , ”
81840	81863	81831	81831	Castro	109	“ Hey , Ari . I hope I ’m on your schedule tomorrow morning . Nobody has rubbed my feet in ages . ”
81864	81869	81870	81870	Ari	204	“ You poor thing , ”
81873	81885	81886	81886	She	204	“ Coincidentally , nobody has proposed marriage to me in ages . ”
81916	81923	81924	81924	Castro	109	“ Hey , that ’s pretty , ”
81927	81933	81924	81924	Castro	109	“ That color suits you . ”
81969	81973	81974	81974	Ari	204	“ Thank you , ”
81982	81988	81974	81974	Ari	204	“ It ’s my birthstone . ”
81989	81992	81993	81993	Castro	109	“ Reeeeally , ”
81997	82001	81993	81993	Castro	109	“ Your birthstone . ”
82002	82007	82008	82008	Castro	109	“ Right . August . ”
82095	82100	82101	82101	Trevi	164	“ So . Ari ? ”
82111	82119	82101	82101	Trevi	164	“ You and she are a thing ? ”
82120	82123	82124	82124	Bayer	137	“ Damn , ”
82132	82158	82124	82124	Bayer	137	“ Did n’t see that one coming . We ’ll all stop proposing marriage to her on the massage table if that makes you uncomfortable . ”
82159	82167	82168	82168	he	137	“ Not sure it matters , champ , ”
82176	82191	82168	82168	he	137	“ She told me quite firmly today that it is n’t gon na happen . ”
82192	82200	82201	82201	Castro	109	“ So I do have a chance , ”
82252	82255	82256	82256	Castro	109	“ Joking , ”
82259	82262	82256	82256	Castro	109	“ Jesus . ”
82263	82271	82272	82272	he	109	“ How do you get over someone ? ”
82288	82323	82285	82285	Trevi	164	“ If you pass out tickets and make us all turn in suggestions , you ’re just gon na get twenty - four pieces of paper back that say get very drunk on ’em . ”
82324	82328	82329	82329	Jimbo	138	“ Not necessarily , ”
82333	82360	82329	82329	Jimbo	138	“ I ’d write : Listen to sad music and play a lot of Xbox . It ’s cheaper than drinking , and a better distraction . ”
82361	82374	82375	82375	Trevi	164	“ You really are wise for a nineteen - year - old , ”
82378	82393	82394	82395	the kid	353	“ And would you believe that the legal drinking age in Ottawa is nineteen ? ”
82401	82406	82407	82407	Trevi	164	“ Drinks for Jimbo ! ”
82418	82424	82425	82425	He	164	“ Who ’s with me ? ”
82445	82452	82438	82438	he	164	“ So what ’s your strategy ? ”
82453	82457	82438	82438	he	164	“ My strategy ? ”
82458	82467	82438	82438	he	164	“ Wait her out or find someone else ? ”
82476	82513	82514	82514	Trevi	164	“ I ’m just going to give her some space . I ’d be lying if I said I was n’t hoping she ’d change her mind . Pretty sure it wo n’t happen , though . ”
82518	82574	82514	82514	Trevi	164	“ You still have a chance . Women are complicated . Let me give you an example . My girl does n’t like to shop . But in a store , she still takes a long time , evaluating all the pros and cons of the features or what - the - fuck - ever . ”
82575	82583	82438	82438	he	164	“ What are you trying to say ? ”
82584	82597	82598	82598	O’Doul	97	“ Women make decisions differently . How do you choose a coffeemaker ? ”
82601	82616	82598	82598	O’Doul	97	“ I point to one that looks good . Then I just buy it . ”
82617	82620	82438	82438	he	164	“ Exactly . ”
82621	82633	82634	82634	He	164	“ So ? What does that have to do with Ari ? ”
82644	82675	82676	82676	O’Doul	97	“ Maybe she already found the model she wants , but she has to walk out of the store one time just to be sure she knows her own mind . ”
82679	82701	82676	82676	O’Doul	97	“ I do n’t know . If I walk in to buy a coffeemaker , I ’m leaving with a coffeemaker . ”
82702	82720	82676	82676	O’Doul	97	“ That ’s my point . You ’re leaving with a coffeemaker because you have a dick . ”
82721	82724	82725	82725	Castro	109	“ Wait — ”
82731	82740	82725	82725	Castro	109	“ Who left his dick in the coffeemaker ? ”
82741	82746	82747	82747	O’Doul	97	“ Check , please , ”
83113	83126	83127	83127	Becca	119	“ We are going to have to celebrate after this is over , ”
83136	83146	83127	83127	Becca	119	“ There are still three minutes on the clock , ”
83151	83159	83147	83147	Georgia	104	“ Do n’t you dare jinx us . ”
83160	83168	83169	83169	Becca	119	“ It ’s going to be fine , ”
83172	83178	83169	83169	Becca	119	“ We ’ve got this . ”
83192	83206	83207	83207	Ari	204	“ She did n’t mean it , god ! Do n’t punish us . ”
83296	83302	83303	83303	Becca	119	“ Now can we celebrate ? ”
83306	83309	83303	83303	Becca	119	“ Sure , ”
83313	83327	83310	83310	Georgia	104	“ I ’ll spring for overpriced drinks at the airport bar before takeoff . ”
83356	83364	83365	83365	Becca	119	“ So let me get this straight . ”
83371	83388	83365	83365	Becca	119	“ You told Doulie you wanted to be friends , and he was okay with that ? ”
83395	83403	83404	83404	she	204	“ He was really nice about it , ”
83407	83453	83454	83454	Georgia	104	“ So nice that I suspect he has a secret plan to change my mind . He knows that each time he tries to remove my clothing , I always shed it like a long - haired cat on a pair of black velvet pants . ”
83457	83468	83454	83454	Georgia	104	“ You sound like you want him to change it . ”
83469	83486	83487	83487	Ari	204	“ I ’ve made up my mind , but my body did n’t get the memo , ”
83490	83526	83487	83487	Ari	204	“ When I told him I needed a friend , he hugged me . And he smelled so freaking good I just wanted to climb into the collar of his shirt and stay there forever . ”
83527	83534	83535	83535	Becca	119	“ That would get weird eventually , ”
83542	83558	83559	83559	Georgia	104	“ This from the woman who slept with her knees against my butt last night , ”
83603	83608	83609	83609	Becca	119	“ You loved it , ”
83612	83646	83609	83609	Becca	119	“ It was just like old times . We watched trash TV and whined about how hard we work . Although , in ye good old days , we were both sexually frustrated . ”
83647	83658	83659	83659	Georgia	104	“ Sorry , toots . I still have my moments , ”
83662	83685	83659	83659	Georgia	104	“ Leo has always had a NNBG rule , even in high school . But lately the time span is getting ridiculous . ”
83686	83691	83692	83692	Ari	204	“ What ’s NNBG ? ”
83695	83701	83702	83702	Georgia	104	“ No Nookie Before Games , ”
83705	83734	83702	83702	Georgia	104	“ He used to only mean hours before . But as we approach the play - offs , he says he likes to save it up for afterward . ”
83746	83775	83776	83776	Becca	119	“ I do n’t really mind , because afterward is pretty great . After that win tonight ? I ’m going to be extra tired at work tomorrow . ”
83793	83819	83776	83776	Becca	119	“ Lord , hear my prayer . Just one hot night ! That ’s all a girl needs , god ! Just send me one . ”
83820	83831	83832	83832	Ari	204	“ You and Castro seemed pretty cozy the other day , ”
83836	83840	83832	83832	Ari	204	“ Anything there ? ”
83841	83844	83845	83845	Becca	119	“ Nah . ”
83851	83868	83845	83845	Becca	119	“ We ’re just buddies . He ’s fun , and we just kid each other . ”
83869	83878	83879	83879	Georgia	104	“ Nate did n’t think it was fun , ”
83896	83905	83879	83879	Georgia	104	“ I ’ve never heard him so grumpy . ”
83906	83912	83913	83913	Becca	119	“ I know , right ? ”
83920	83948	83913	83913	Becca	119	“ He ’s just out to ruin a good time . He thinks I ought to actually work for my paycheck . The nerve of that man . ”
83949	83955	83956	83956	Georgia	104	“ Bottoms up , girls . ”
83973	83979	83980	83980	She	104	“ The jet is boarding . ”
83988	83994	83995	83995	Becca	119	“ Look at her hurrying , ”
83998	84007	84008	84008	She	119	“ She ’s going home to a sextravaganza . ”
84015	84027	84008	84008	She	119	“ Your plan to stay single just baffles me right now . ”
84028	84034	84035	84035	she	119	“ I have my reasons , ”
84271	84275	84276	84276	he	97	“ Good morning , ”
84333	84337	84338	84338	she	204	“ Hi there , ”
84351	84361	84338	84338	she	204	“ I sure enjoyed watching you skate last night . ”
84362	84369	84370	84370	he	97	“ I enjoyed it , too , ”
84402	84413	84392	84392	She	204	“ How ’s your hip today ? Any new soreness ? ”
84414	84447	84396	84396	her	204	“ Feeling pretty flexible , actually . I had some pain by the end of the game last night , but on balance it ’s less than it was ten days ago . ”
84448	84451	84452	84452	she	204	“ Awesome , ”
84466	84478	84452	84452	she	204	“ Was it okay with you that Crikey took the fight ? ”
84479	84482	84396	84396	her	204	“ Yeah . ”
84495	84521	84483	84483	He	97	“ He and I are gon na train together some more . We both need to stay injury free . We ’ll work something out . ”
84522	84528	84529	84529	she	204	“ I know you will , ”
84600	84606	84607	84607	she	204	“ Turn over for me ? ”
84610	84618	84607	84607	she	204	“ I ’m done with your hip . ”
84619	84622	84607	84607	she	204	“ Already ? ”
84696	84704	84705	84705	he	97	“ Let me ask you a question , ”
84718	84721	84705	84705	he	97	“ Anything . ”
84722	84740	84767	84767	Her	204	“ When you need to buy something , do you take a long time thinking it over ? ”
84741	84756	84705	84705	he	97	“ Hmm . It depends what it is , and how much it costs . ”
84757	84766	84767	84767	Her	204	“ Say I needed to buy a coffeemaker . ”
84785	84797	84798	84798	she	204	“ They all just push hot water through grounds , right ? ”
84808	84816	84798	84798	she	204	“ No point in dragging that out . ”
84817	84821	84822	84822	he	97	“ Fucking Trevi , ”
84829	84839	84822	84822	he	97	“ What ’s that ? Am I hurting you ? ”
84844	84851	84822	84822	he	97	“ No . That feels great . ”
84902	84905	84906	84906	he	150	“ O’Doul , ”
84909	84920	84906	84906	he	150	“ Step into my office . We have a situation . ”
85019	85025	85026	85026	he	97	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
85044	85053	85026	85026	he	97	“ There ’s a journalist from the Post . ”
85061	85106	85054	85054	His	97	“ She says she can prove you bought drugs in a nightclub . Apparently that ’s not enough of a story for her , either . Sounds like she ’s going to try to spin this thing into some kind of big doping scandal . ”
85168	85180	85181	85181	he	97	“ Hugh , the team does n’t have a doping problem , ”
85184	85189	85181	85181	he	97	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
85190	85193	85194	85194	Hugh	150	“ Yeah , ”
85207	85220	85194	85194	Hugh	150	“ It is . But that still leaves us with a problem . ”
85225	85245	85194	85194	Hugh	150	“ She says there ’s a picture . You in some nightclub ’s back room , making a buy . ”
85254	85263	85264	85264	he	97	“ What is it that I supposedly bought ? ”
85277	85315	85271	85271	Hugh	150	“ Do n’t play it that way , Doulie . Just tell me what the hell happened at that club . I ca n’t help you if I do n’t know what I ’m really dealing with . ”
85384	85393	85394	85394	he	150	“ I have to speak to my agent , ”
85397	85405	85394	85394	he	150	“ Seriously ? After all this time ? ”
85411	85430	85408	85408	his	150	“ Just talk to me . You think I ’m going to just toss you to the wolves ? ”
85438	85449	85450	85450	He	150	“ I ’m calling Tommy . We ’ll speak later . ”
85768	85771	85772	85772	Tom	134	“ Doulie ? ”
85776	85784	85772	85772	Tom	134	“ Hey , man . Everything okay ? ”
85785	85789	85806	85806	O’Doul	97	“ Not really . ”
85790	85796	85797	85797	Tom	134	“ Sorry to hear that , ”
85800	85805	85797	85797	Tom	134	“ What ’s up ? ”
85816	85824	85825	85825	Tom	134	“ When were you at this club ? ”
85842	85845	85828	85829	The man	402	“ January . ”
85846	85852	85853	85853	O’Doul	97	“ What did you buy ? ”
85855	85858	85853	85853	O’Doul	97	“ uppers , ”
85890	85893	85894	85894	Tom	134	“ Okay , ”
85898	85908	85894	85894	Tom	134	“ When ’s the last time you took one ? ”
85913	85921	85894	85894	Tom	134	“ When did I play at Denver ? ”
85922	85926	85927	85927	He	134	“ Hang on . ”
85935	85939	85927	85927	He	134	“ February second . ”
85940	85960	85961	85961	Tom	134	“ That ’s the night . We went to Phoenix after that , and my stash was fresh out . ”
85964	85976	85961	85961	Tom	134	“ So that ’s . . . more than six weeks . ”
85977	85980	85927	85927	He	134	“ Yeah . ”
85981	85986	85927	85927	He	134	“ You ’re sure ? ”
85987	85990	85961	85961	Tom	134	“ Absolutely . ”
85991	86008	85927	85927	He	134	“ Anything else in your bloodstream that you would n’t want written up in the Post ? ”
86009	86021	86022	86023	His agent	1885	“ No sir . Unless they ’re testing for Scotch whiskey . ”
86030	86086	86022	86023	His agent	1885	“ Okay , man . Here ’s what I need you to do — deny this completely . Whatever the picture looks like , it ’s not you in it . Or it is you , but you ’re paying for a lap dance or some shit . Just deny anything to do with drugs . ”
86087	86094	85927	85927	He	134	“ You think that will work ? ”
86095	86144	86022	86023	His agent	1885	“ That stuff is only testable for a few days . A week , tops . But , shit Doulie . Buying at a nightclub ? Worst idea I ever heard . Those places thrive on blackmail . They do n’t make all their money selling overpriced martinis . ”
86147	86164	86022	86023	His agent	1885	“ Not exactly skilled at breaking the law , Tommy . Only bought the one time . ”
86165	86168	86169	86170	His agent	1885	“ Once ? ”
86177	86216	86169	86170	His agent	1885	“ Then you are one unlucky bastard . You ca n’t trust anyone , okay ? There ’s something you think you need , you tell me . I ’ll find a guy to get it to you . ”
86241	86267	86223	86224	his agent	1885	“ Are you positive I ca n’t be nailed on a drug test ? Should I just offer to take one to clear the air ? ”
86268	86295	86296	86296	O’Doul	97	“ If you ’re sure you ’ve got the timing right . And if you ’re sure your club wo n’t just lie about your results . ”
86319	86326	86327	86327	he	134	“ Hugh wo n’t do that , ”
86330	86354	86327	86327	he	134	“ He ’s not an asshole , and it would make the team look bad . I think Hugh wants to help me . ”
86355	86358	86359	86359	Tom	134	“ Careful , ”
86362	86451	86359	86359	Tom	134	“ The only person you can trust is me , because our interests are completely aligned . But Hugh does n’t have the luxury of being loyal . Give your team a flat - out denial , and offer a test . They might not even test you . In the first place , there ’re more recreational drugs in hockey than you can shake a hockey stick at . And Hugh does n’t want to start a real witch hunt . Nobody will end up looking good . ”
86452	86471	86327	86327	he	134	“ All right . But forget Hugh for a second . What can the league do to me ? ”
86472	86552	86359	86359	Tom	134	“ Nothing , except test you if they feel like it . But they ca n’t test the whole team until the postseason , no matter what the newspaper prints . Now let me go so I can call Hugh on your behalf as soon as we hang up . Do n’t forget the party line — whatever they think those pictures show , they ’re crazy . And that ’s all we have to say on the subject . ”
86553	86557	86327	86327	he	134	“ All right . ”
86558	86586	86359	86359	Tom	134	“ Stay strong , man . We ’ll get through this . They ’ll be offering you a contract extension in July like we need ’em to . ”
86587	86590	86591	86591	They	1894	“ Thanks . ”
87711	87715	87716	87716	she	204	“ Good morning , ”
87734	87745	87746	87746	She	204	“ Let ’s open our practice in a seated position . ”
87757	87770	87746	87746	She	204	“ It ’s cold outside , and I really feel the chill . ”
87779	87799	87800	87804	A couple of the players	1937	“ So we ’re going to raise the temperature of our practice today , and sweat out our tensions . ”
87860	87900	87901	87901	She	204	“ Rise into mountain pose , please . On the exhale , forward fold . Hang there and gently roll your head for two breath cycles . On the next inhale , rise to Utkatasana . . . Good . ”
87921	87932	87933	87933	she	204	“ . . . Arms up , offering the heart , ”
87943	87953	87933	87933	she	204	“ On the exhale , dive into forward fold . ”
88014	88040	88045	88045	she	204	“ Inhale , rising to half lift , finding length in your back . Exhale , hands planted , feet float back to high plank . ”
88064	88081	88045	88045	she	204	“ Exhale , rising into downward dog . Now walk it out . Stretch those hamstrings . ”
88240	88244	88245	88245	she	204	“ Well done , ”
88264	88302	88303	88303	She	204	“ Balance is the key to all strength . Notice how your breath moves through the body in this pose . And at the bottom of the next breath , bring it back into a forward fold . ”
88335	88344	88345	88345	Castro	109	“ I never saw a pigeon do this , ”
88353	88356	88357	88357	she	204	“ Mmhhmm , ”
88381	88387	88388	88388	she	204	“ Take it easy here , ”
88430	88435	88436	88436	She	204	“ Are you okay ? ”
88451	88454	88455	88455	he	109	“ Sure , ”
88458	88466	88467	88467	she	204	“ Are you on my schedule later ? ”
88494	88500	88501	88501	he	109	“ Not sure it matters , ”
88589	88594	88595	88595	she	204	“ Namaste , class , ”
88601	88604	88595	88595	she	204	“ Namaste , ”
88800	88807	88797	88797	Ari	204	“ What the fuck is this ? ”
88837	88842	88843	88843	she	204	“ This is bullshit , ”
88897	88900	88877	88877	She	204	“ Ari ? ”
88909	88914	88903	88903	her	119	“ Are you okay ? ”
88915	88922	88923	88923	She	204	“ No ! This . . . ”
88929	88941	88923	88923	She	204	“ It ca n’t be him . Where is Hugh Major ? ”
89012	89019	89020	89020	she	204	“ Guys , this is bullshit , ”
89028	89069	89020	89020	she	204	“ He ’s making this up to get back at me . You can put me in front of that reporter . She should know that the owner of that club is just pissed off at Patrick because of me . ”
89085	89094	89095	89095	she	204	“ Am I not speaking English right now ? ”
89105	89112	89095	89095	she	204	“ This is all my fault . ”
89128	89137	89122	89122	Hugh	150	“ We ’ll talk in a little while . ”
89143	89148	89149	89149	Ari	204	“ What the fuck ? ”
89152	89159	89149	89149	Ari	204	“ Let ’s just fix this . ”
89160	89171	89172	89172	Patrick	97	“ Ari , has he tried to contact you today ? ”
89179	89183	89184	89184	she	204	“ He texted , ”
89187	89193	89175	89175	his	97	“ But it ’s ridiculous . ”
89194	89203	89175	89175	his	97	“ What did he say ? Show me . ”
89204	89207	89208	89208	she	204	“ Why ? ”
89211	89237	89208	89208	she	204	“ It ’s just a smear campaign . He ’s using you to hit at me . That ’s not even you in the picture . ”
89247	89250	89251	89251	He	97	“ Ari . ”
89262	89271	89251	89251	He	97	“ It ’s me in the fucking picture . ”
89272	89277	89278	89278	She	204	“ You . . . ”
89286	89301	89278	89278	She	204	“ Really ? When ? And what were you doing at Vince ’s club ? ”
89306	89334	89302	89302	His	97	“ I was there just randomly with a bunch of team members . It was Massey ’s birthday , I think . It does n’t matter why . ”
89335	89359	89360	89360	He	97	“ The Post thinks it does ! God , I ’m so sorry . This is awful . It ’s all my fault . ”
89389	89408	89375	89375	Those	1971	“ There is nothing about this that ’s your fault . That ’s all I can tell you . ”
89409	89414	89360	89360	He	97	“ But . . . ”
89461	89466	89467	89467	she	204	“ Wait — seriously ? ”
89470	89480	89467	89467	she	204	“ You went to a club to buy drugs ? ”
89502	89507	89492	89492	He	97	“ Jesus , Patrick . ”
89514	89534	89492	89492	He	97	“ So when you punched Vince at my house , you already knew him . He was your dealer . ”
89535	89545	89546	89546	he	97	“ We are not talking about this . . . ”
89552	89559	89560	89560	she	204	“ Oh . My . God , ”
89568	89589	89560	89560	she	204	“ This whole time you were sticking close to me because you needed to know what Vince was up to . ”
89590	89593	89594	89594	he	97	“ NO ! ”
89597	89604	89594	89594	he	97	“ That is not what happened . ”
89605	89608	89609	89609	she	204	“ Wow , ”
89616	89639	89609	89609	she	204	“ People told me that you never got close to anyone , and how unusual it was . Now I know why . ”
89669	89680	89681	89681	he	97	“ That ’s all the faith you have in me , ”
89687	89694	89681	89681	he	97	“ At least now I know . ”
89711	89736	89737	89737	He	97	“ Thanks for lying to me . When I asked you to be my friend , that ’s not what I had in mind . ”
89985	89996	89975	89975	she	204	“ I am so done with liars in my life ! ”
90175	90178	90179	90179	she	204	“ Vince , ”
90182	90193	90179	90179	she	204	“ This is no way to get what you want . ”
90194	90208	90259	90259	he	125	“ Yeah , it is . And you need to hear exactly why . ”
90218	90224	90259	90259	he	125	“ What are you saying ? ”
90225	90248	90259	90259	he	125	“ I have video of your boyfriend making the buy . Check your e - mail . I sent you a clip . ”
90397	90400	90401	90401	he	125	“ Look , ”
90407	90459	90401	90401	he	125	“ Sorry to be the bearer of bad news . I know you think the dicks you work for are the second coming of Christ . Maybe you think I ’m a loser for getting mixed up with some drug dealers , Ari , but I do n’t swallow that shit . ”
90477	90485	90473	90473	him	125	“ What do you want from me ? ”
90486	90582	90401	90401	he	125	“ Give me my property and I ’m gone . You ’ll never hear my name again . But if you do n’t help me , tonight I ’m giving the reporter a bunch more material . Here ’s the thing — with a little creative editing I can also make it look like he bought the stuff to share with the rest of the team . They ’ll all know it ’s bogus , too . And they ’ll blame you for it . Bye - bye job . So open your front door . ”
90583	90591	90592	90592	He	1993	“ I ’m not home right now . ”
90595	90620	90592	90592	He	1993	“ Really ? You have a twin I do n’t know about ? Just saw you walk through your front door two minutes ago . ”
90623	90650	90592	90592	He	1993	“ I need to get into your house , and right now . One thing is all I need . It ’s smaller than a breadbox . ”
90651	90660	90661	90661	He	1993	“ What is ? What are you after ? ”
90667	90689	90661	90661	He	1993	“ A gun , babe . You want a handgun in your house ? It was used in a crime scene . ”
90690	90693	90694	90694	she	1994	“ Jesus , ”
90697	90709	90694	90694	she	1994	“ Why the hell is there a gun in my house ? ”
90710	90748	90661	90661	He	1993	“ It ’s evidence , and it ’s protecting me from some grade - A assholes . I need it right fucking now , Ari . It will take ten minutes . Or less if you help . ”
90749	90758	90759	90759	Someone	329	“ Help ? You ca n’t be serious . ”
90776	90805	90768	90768	Ari	204	“ Let me in . We can do this the easy way or the hard way . Pick easy , babe . Ten minutes and it ’s done . ”
90888	90894	90895	90895	she	1994	“ There ’s nobody here , ”
90925	90930	90931	90931	he	125	“ It ’s upstairs , ”
90971	90974	90962	90962	she	1994	“ Where ? ”
90975	90982	90983	90983	She	204	“ The bedroom . Go on . ”
91118	91125	91126	91126	he	125	“ We ’re moving the bed , ”
91129	91134	91126	91126	he	125	“ It ’s underneath . ”
91195	91199	91200	91200	Vince	125	“ Come on , ”
91203	91217	91200	91200	Vince	125	“ We have to move this so I can get under the floorboards . ”
91284	91290	91291	91291	he	125	“ Ready ? Toward me , ”
91294	91297	91291	91291	he	125	“ Go . ”
91306	91314	91315	91315	she	204	“ Do n’t lift with your back , ”
91476	91479	91470	91483	a smiling Vince who called her “ my girl ” and liked to dance	2007	“ my girl ”
91553	91575	91547	91547	He	125	“ Yeah , I know . Stay in your Zen bubble , girl . You think you ’re better than me . ”
91600	91607	91608	91608	she	204	“ I was loyal to you , ”
91612	91624	91608	91608	she	204	“ Whatever attitude you think I have is in your head . ”
91625	91628	91645	91645	Patrick	97	“ ARI ! ”
91649	91653	91654	91654	he	125	“ Man on ! ”
91709	91712	91715	91715	Vince	125	“ Fuck , ”
91740	91748	91749	91750	a stranger	1950	“ You got something there for me ? ”
91837	91847	91848	91849	the stranger	2016	“ Just take it out , nice and slow , ”
91854	91862	91848	91849	the stranger	2016	“ Let ’s make a little deal , ”
91976	91981	91947	91947	she	204	“ Who ’s that ? ”
92356	92363	92364	92364	she	204	“ Oh my G . . . ”
92519	92523	92524	92524	he	97	“ Stay low , ”
92544	92547	92530	92530	He	97	“ Go . ”
92660	92664	92665	92665	He	97	“ That restaurant . ”
92671	92676	92665	92665	He	97	“ Run . Now . ”
92742	92746	92747	92747	Patrick	97	“ Dial 911 , ”
92814	92845	92810	92810	he	97	“ Gunfire on Hudson Ave . Number seventy - one . Two or three men inside the house , at least one of them armed . Handgun . Shots fired . ”
92851	92870	92871	92871	He	97	“ No , I ’m not inside the house . I ’m at the restaurant across the street . ”
92996	93003	92981	92981	he	97	“ Baby , you ’re bleeding . ”
93030	93038	93039	93039	he	97	“ That ’s from the broken glass , ”
93043	93054	93039	93039	he	97	“ Are you hurt anywhere else ? Anywhere at all ? ”
93080	93085	93086	93086	he	97	“ Breathe , sweetheart , ”
93089	93098	93086	93086	he	97	“ It will pass . It always does . ”
93120	93123	93124	93124	he	97	“ Shh , ”
93134	93148	93124	93124	he	97	“ I know you ’re in shock , but it will be okay . ”
93243	93249	93250	93250	Patrick	97	“ Let them handle it , ”
93253	93263	93250	93250	Patrick	97	“ They ’ll be asking you questions soon enough . ”
93369	93376	93377	93378	a cop	2058	“ What can you tell me ? ”
93399	93405	93406	93406	she	204	“ I was home alone , ”
93425	93440	93441	93441	Ari	204	“ He demanded to come in and get something that was his . . . ”
93505	93510	93511	93511	Patrick	97	“ That ’s enough , ”
93514	93538	93511	93511	Patrick	97	“ You need Detective Miller . He has all this history already , and she is n’t ready to repeat it right now . ”
93539	93545	93546	93547	The cop	1127	“ I ’ll call him . ”
93553	93560	93546	93547	The cop	1127	“ Just do n’t go anywhere . ”
93585	93594	93595	93595	she	119	“ Nathan is on his way to Brooklyn , ”
93598	93601	93595	93595	she	119	“ Geez , ”
93621	93630	93631	93631	Becca	119	“ Is there going to be ugly publicity ? ”
93637	93655	93631	93631	Becca	119	“ Let Georgia worry about it , okay ? Sweetie , I have to tell you something . ”
93656	93659	93660	93661	Her friend	629	“ What ? ”
93667	93682	93660	93661	Her friend	629	“ Vince was shot in the chest , and he did n’t make it . ”
93683	93688	93690	93690	she	119	“ Vince . . . ”
93696	93700	93690	93690	she	119	“ He died ? ”
93701	93707	93708	93708	Rebecca	119	“ Yeah , he did . ”
93713	93729	93708	93708	Rebecca	119	“ I ’m so sorry . I know you spent a long time with him . ”
93730	93733	93734	93734	she	119	“ Wow , ”
93817	93822	93823	93823	she	119	“ What a waste , ”

94483	94489	94490	94490	she	204	“ Why were you there ? ”
94504	94513	94490	94490	she	204	“ How did you know something was wrong ? ”
94519	94597	94516	94516	his	97	“ When Nate ’s people gave you that panic button , they also programmed your phone to pick up anything suspicious from Vince . I was just leaving the rink when I got a call from security saying you ’d had two phone conversations with him , and an email with a threatening subject . They could see that I was only a block and a half away , and they asked me to check on you . ”
94598	94603	94604	94604	He	97	“ Oh . Wow . ”
94672	94681	94682	94682	she	2098	“ I should never have let him in , ”
94689	94703	94682	94682	she	2098	“ He might still be alive if I did n’t open that door . ”
94704	94761	94685	94685	her	2098	“ That was not your fault . It was never going to end well for him . I heard the police say the Pryzyk brothers had been hunting for Vince and that gun . He stole it from them for some kind of leverage , I think . That was n’t ever gon na end well . ”
94762	94781	94782	94782	He	2101	“ I ’m sorry you got dragged into it . Wish I could make it up to you . ”
94794	94799	94800	94800	he	2101	“ Christ , Ari , ”
94803	94817	94800	94800	he	2101	“ You do n’t have to do anything but keep breathing , okay ? ”
94834	94850	94820	94820	her	2098	“ You got me out of there . I ca n’t even believe . . . ”
94864	94867	94853	94853	her	2098	“ Shhh . ”
94879	94888	94868	94868	He	2101	“ You would have been okay either way . ”
94895	94914	94889	94889	She	2098	“ It ’s finally done , right ? It ’s over . That guy got away , though . ”
94962	94969	94970	94970	he	2101	“ It ’s over , sweetheart , ”
94973	94983	94984	94984	He	2101	“ You ’ve got nowhere to go but up . ”
95149	95154	95155	95155	she	204	“ I ’m cold , ”
95164	95203	95204	95204	He	2101	“ You have n’t eaten much today , and your body is off - kilter . Shock is tricky . We could tuck you into bed under a pile of blankets . Or you could have a bath . ”
95213	95218	95204	95204	He	2101	“ That sounds nice . ”
95231	95243	95219	95219	He	2101	“ I ’ll run it for you . Be right back . ”
95350	95363	95364	95364	She	204	“ You ’ll have to keep your hands out of the water . ”
95368	95390	95364	95364	She	204	“ Good point . But I still want to soak right now . I just want to wash it all away . ”
95391	95411	95412	95412	Ari	204	“ I know , baby . Go ahead . I ’ll bring you a mug of tea , too ? ”
95419	95432	95412	95412	Ari	204	“ I have no idea what I ’d do without you today . ”
95682	95687	95688	95688	she	204	“ Are you okay ? ”
95692	95697	95698	95698	he	2101	“ I ’m fine , ”
95702	95712	95698	95698	he	2101	“ Earlier today we were shouting at each other . ”
95713	95717	95718	95718	he	2101	“ I remember , ”
95721	95728	95718	95718	he	2101	“ But that conversation can wait . ”
95729	95737	95698	95698	he	2101	“ You ’ll tell me the truth ? ”
95738	95742	95743	95743	he	2101	“ I will , ”
95784	95791	95792	95792	she	204	“ I got you a coffeemaker , ”
95796	95799	95792	95792	she	204	“ What ? ”
95800	95848	95854	95854	He	2101	“ A coffeemaker . You asked me if they were easy to shop for , so I just bought you the same model I have at home . It ’s in my treatment room . I did n’t get a chance to give it to you today . ”
95860	95877	95854	95854	He	2101	“ Thank you , sweetheart . That was nice of you . Now go to sleep . ”
96012	96020	96005	96005	Georgia	104	“ Hey ! How are you feeling ? ”
96027	96049	96021	96021	Ari	204	“ I ’m okay . I ’ll try to go one day in a row without being the team drama llama . ”
96050	96075	96005	96005	Georgia	104	“ Aim high , girl . I ’ll be ready to go in about a half hour . Is that enough time for you ? ”
96076	96098	96144	96144	Ari	204	“ Sure . I ’m just going to use Patrick ’s amazing shower , in case I ’m never invited back . ”
96099	96106	96021	96021	Ari	204	“ Why would n’t you be ? ”
96107	96127	96005	96005	Georgia	104	“ If you have time to stop for coffee on the way to work , I ’ll tell you . ”
96200	96214	96215	96215	Ari	204	“ So I gave him a lot of grief right before everything happened , ”
96225	96271	96272	96272	Georgia	104	“ And I still do n’t know what to think . It does n’t square up in my mind that Patrick likes to buy drugs . He just does n’t strike me as the type . But he did n’t deny that it was true . ”
96293	96349	96288	96288	she	104	“ I ’ll admit that he does n’t seem the type , either . He ’s awfully serious . And nobody has ever whispered about substances in connection with Doulie . Not to me , anyway . And yesterday , before all the mayhem began at your house , he submitted a voluntary drug test . ”
96350	96353	96354	96354	Ari	204	“ Yeah ? ”
96362	96377	96354	96354	Ari	204	“ But I ’m told that most street drugs clear your system pretty fast . ”
96378	96387	96388	96388	Ari	204	“ I do n’t know what to think , ”
96391	96430	96388	96388	Ari	204	“ I ’m completely weirded out by the fact that he and Vince had met before . And that he bought drugs . Jesus . I should have gotten involved with a nice tax accountant who enjoys golf . ”
96436	96447	96431	96431	Georgia	104	“ Then you ’d die of boredom instead of gunfire . ”
96448	96451	96354	96354	Ari	204	“ True . ”
96464	96503	96504	96504	Georgia	104	“ It ’s weird how much I still trust him . That ’s pretty much a summary of all my interactions with Patrick . My heart trusts him , but my brain is always screaming wait a second ! ”
96511	96516	96508	96508	her	104	“ You kill me . ”
96517	96520	96354	96354	Ari	204	“ Why ? ”
96521	96559	96508	96508	her	104	“ Because you ’re flawed , just like the rest of us . I used to be intimidated by you and all your yoga wisdom . Now I know you ’re just as nuts as I am . ”
96560	96565	96566	96566	Ari	204	“ Oh , goody , ”
96572	96587	96566	96566	Ari	204	“ Will you at least tell me how I ’ve been nuts this morning ? ”
96588	96591	96592	96592	Georgia	104	“ Sure . ”
96599	96626	96592	96592	Georgia	104	“ In every yoga class you always ask us to observe how we feel , and to notice it from a place of curiosity . . . ”
96627	96634	96635	96635	Ari	204	“ . . . Not judgment , ”
96638	96641	96642	96642	Georgia	104	“ Exactly , ”
96650	96720	96642	96642	Georgia	104	“ But every conversation we have about Doulie has you saying — I like him so much , but it ’s wrong . Wrong time . Wrong guy . Wrong to meet someone at work . See , I do n’t think you ’re observing from a place of curiosity , yogi . I think you ’re Miss Judgie McJudgerson when it comes to how you feel about him . ”
96721	96726	96727	96727	Ari	204	“ Oh , hell , ”
96735	96739	96730	96730	Georgia	104	“ I know . ”
96740	96782	96642	96642	Georgia	104	“ But , God . It ’s like I ca n’t afford to be curious just now . Because I had my eyes entirely closed for the last couple of years , and that ’s still blowing up in my face . ”
96783	96809	96642	96642	Georgia	104	“ I get it . Except I wonder what your favorite yogis would say to the idea that you ’re too busy to be curious . ”
96810	96818	96819	96819	Ari	204	“ They ’d say it was bullshit , ”
96822	96850	96851	96851	She	204	“ That I ’m just using fear as an excuse to withdraw . That I ’ve let fear triumph over the heart ’s natural inclination to explore . ”
96854	96859	96851	96851	She	204	“ The truth hurts . ”
96860	96875	96876	96876	Georgia	104	“ The truth requires a cookie for the road , do n’t you think ? ”
96915	96919	96920	96920	Georgia	104	“ Something wrong ? ”
96923	96951	96920	96920	Georgia	104	“ There ’s no schedule for me listed — no yoga class and no massage appointments . But there ’s a meeting in the C - suite . ”
96952	96965	96910	96910	she	204	“ They ’re just looking after you . No need to panic . ”
96980	97001	96973	96973	Rebecca	119	“ It ’s about time you girls made it into work . Which one of you brought me a cookie ? ”
97008	97020	97021	97021	Becca	119	“ You spied on us ? You tracked our Katt Phones ? ”
97026	97067	97021	97021	Becca	119	“ Hers is on the top security setting right now , so the GPS is open in a window on my desktop . I saw two blue dots having pastries while I was alone here , toiling at my desk . ”
97082	97093	97072	97072	Georgia	104	“ Here . This is for you . Oatmeal raisin . ”
97101	97107	97094	97094	Becca	119	“ That ’s your favorite . ”
97108	97125	97126	97126	Georgia	104	“ No kidding . But take it because I love you . And no more questions . ”
97138	97141	97126	97126	Georgia	104	“ So , ”
97150	97160	97142	97142	Ari	204	“ What ’s this meeting where I ’m needed ? ”
97221	97229	97230	97230	Becca	119	“ It ’s with the private investigator , ”
97233	97246	97230	97230	Becca	119	“ Jay ’s coming in to share the findings of the investigation . ”
97247	97252	97253	97253	Ari	204	“ Uh . . . ”
97278	97298	97299	97299	Becca	119	“ Is n’t it a little late to hear his findings ? I ’m not worried about Vince anymore . ”
97302	97331	97299	97299	Becca	119	“ I do n’t know , honey , because Hugh wanted you to hear this . And he would n’t waste your time , today of all days . ”
97361	97368	97369	97370	the woman	731	“ Hi . I ’m Jay , ”
97403	97407	97408	97409	the investigator	2142	“ I know , ”
97416	97423	97408	97409	the investigator	2142	“ You were expecting a man . ”
97424	97434	97435	97435	she	204	“ It ’s just . . . your name ? ”
97494	97515	97485	97485	Jay	245	“ Do n’t worry about it . I get that all the time . And it helps me , too . ”
97516	97520	97485	97485	Jay	245	“ It does ? ”
97521	97528	97530	97530	her	204	“ Sure . Your ex , for example”—Jay
97531	97539	97485	97485	Jay	245	eyes—“and I ’m sorry for your loss . ”
97540	97544	97545	97545	Ari	204	“ Thank you , ”
97585	97621	97577	97577	she	204	“ . . . He ’d been very paranoid this past week , looking over his shoulders a lot . What do you think he did every time I walked through his line of vision ? ”
97622	97627	97628	97628	Ari	204	“ Um . . . ”
97658	97677	97655	97655	Jay	245	“ That ’s right , he ignored me . Makes my job easier , let me tell you . ”
97694	97734	97678	97678	She	204	“ Okay , what I ’ve gathered comes too little too late . And I ’m sorry about that . We do n’t have to talk at all , except Hugh Major thought it might give you some closure . ”
97753	97760	97761	97761	Jay	245	“ Tell me what you found . ”
97766	97807	97761	97761	Jay	245	“ I got some of my information from tailing him , and some of it from policemen who will share certain things with me . But I do n’t have access to everything . So there ’s some guesswork involved . ”
97808	97811	97678	97678	She	204	“ Okay . ”
97812	97848	97849	97849	She	204	“ The police probably wo n’t lay it out for you , either , because parts of their investigation will be ongoing . So my guesses might be the best you get for a while . ”
97857	97868	97849	97849	She	204	“ This is where Vince was staying before he died . ”
97869	97872	97849	97849	She	204	“ Yikes . ”
97884	97924	97849	97849	She	204	“ Things had gone sour with the Pryzyks . From what I gathered with a little help from my friends on the homicide squad , they think the Pryzyks might have been responsible for the murder of Andre Karsecki . ”
97925	97930	97931	97931	Jay	245	“ That nightclub murder ? ”
97934	97951	97931	97931	Jay	245	“ It does n’t seem like Vince was involved , but he may have witnessed it . ”
97952	97955	97849	97849	She	204	“ Okay . ”
98001	98032	97997	97997	she	204	“ Maybe the Pryzyks asked him to dispose of the gun , or maybe he stole it as insurance . But he ’d kept it at your home for safekeeping . ”
98033	98039	98040	98040	Ari	204	“ I wonder . . . ”
98048	98062	98063	98063	Jay	245	“ Why was he in and out of my storage room so much ? ”
98066	98106	98063	98063	Jay	245	“ I did n’t start tailing him until after that , but I can make a few guesses . Maybe the Pryzyks knew you ’d kicked him out , so he thought they would n’t look for him there . ”
98107	98113	98114	98114	Ari	204	“ Or for the gun , ”
98117	98140	98114	98114	Ari	204	“ Right . At the very end they caught up to him , though . They tailed him to your house yesterday . ”
98144	98182	98114	98114	Ari	204	“ There ’s something else you should know , though . When I was digging into Vince ’s motives for harassing you , I discovered there ’s a transfer of property happening regarding your Hudson Street home . ”
98183	98195	98196	98196	She	204	“ A transfer of . . . What does that mean ? ”
98207	98221	98196	98196	She	204	“ Mr. Angelo Bettini is executing a transfer of ownership of the house . ”
98222	98226	98114	98114	Ari	204	“ To who ? ”
98227	98231	98232	98232	Jay	245	“ To you , ”
98235	98243	98232	98232	Jay	245	“ Unless there ’s another Ariana Bettini . ”
98244	98247	98248	98248	she	204	“ Really ? ”
98251	98260	98248	98248	she	204	“ I thought he wanted to cash in . ”
98269	98299	98261	98261	Jay	245	“ He ’s eighty - four years old . Maybe he ’s realizing that you ca n’t take it with you . Does he have children of his own ? ”
98303	98311	98261	98261	Jay	245	“ Two sons . They should inherit . ”
98312	98340	98358	98358	he	2152	“ Maybe they ’re inheriting something else . I ’m sorry to drop this little mystery in your lap , but I dug it up by accident . ”
98341	98346	98347	98347	Ari	204	“ Did Vince know ? ”
98375	98382	98383	98383	Jay	245	“ I really could n’t guess , ”
98387	98428	98383	98383	Jay	245	“ Your uncle would have had the quitclaim deed notarized . Then he filed it with the state , where it became a public part of the tax rolls . But he ’d have to have looked to find it . ”
98447	98454	98455	98455	Jay	245	“ Thank you for telling me . ”
98461	98475	98455	98455	Jay	245	“ You ’re going to be okay . You know that , right ? ”
98476	98479	98480	98480	Ari	204	“ Yes , ”
98483	98491	98480	98480	Ari	204	“ I ’m going to be fine . ”
98492	98553	98554	98554	She	204	“ I investigate a lot of people , and some of them are pretty awful . To me , Vince just seemed really lost and scared . He made a lot of shitty choices during the last three months of his life . It happens . Good and evil are for movies , Ari . Nobody is ever that tidy . ”
98565	98574	98554	98554	She	204	“ Thank you . I think I understand . ”
98671	98675	98676	98676	Becca	119	“ You okay ? ”
98682	98687	98688	98688	she	119	“ I ’m good , ”
98692	98708	98688	98688	she	119	“ And I ’m looking forward to the day when nobody asks me that anymore . ”
98709	98740	98676	98676	Becca	119	“ I ’ll bet . I have some news — the police are done at your place , and the fix - it people are on their way over there . ”
98741	98745	98688	98688	she	119	“ Thank you . ”
98746	98768	98769	98769	She	119	“ Do n’t mention it . So keep yourself busy here for a few hours and then you can go home . ”
98914	98931	98909	98910	Doctor Herberts	251	“ Your drug test yesterday revealed no banned substances , no narcotics and no recreational drugs . ”
98977	98981	98982	98982	he	97	“ All right , ”
98992	99001	98986	98988	The two doctors	2171	“ So let ’s have a hypothetical conversation , ”
99006	99021	99002	99003	Dr. Mulvey	250	“ Because Herberts and I get paid by the hour and we like talking . ”
99030	99041	99002	99003	Dr. Mulvey	250	“ Okay . What hypotheticals do you feel like discussing ? ”
99042	99053	99054	99054	Mulvey	250	“ Well , you ’re the captain of the team , ”
99057	99076	99054	99054	Mulvey	250	“ So you should know a few things in case one of your guys ever needs the information . ”
99077	99083	99084	99084	Herberts	251	“ All right . Shoot . ”
99089	99121	99122	99122	he	251	“ If a player had a wrist injury earlier in the season , and was given some painkillers , he might become addicted to them through no fault of his own , ”
99139	99172	99173	99173	O’Doul	97	“ Sometimes a player who has a wrist injury does n’t even fill his prescription after the hospital procedure because Vicodin made him throw up the one other time he took it , ”
99209	99213	99214	99214	Herberts	251	“ All right , ”
99218	99301	99214	99214	Herberts	251	“ From time to time a player might have use for other kinds of pills . Uppers , maybe . In that case , the team ’s doctors would still offer that player a treatment program to free himself of the addiction . And if the player does n’t feel comfortable telling his troubles to someone who works for the team , that player ought to know that there are other doctors in the city , and other ways of getting help . ”
99364	99423	99348	99348	He	97	“ That is encouraging . And I ’ll make sure my team knows it . But sometimes a player tries something , and even though the effects are awfully attractive , it ’s hard to get . And maybe after he burns through his ill - gotten supply , he quits because asking around for it is embarrassing . ”
99424	99427	99428	99428	Herberts	251	“ Okay , ”
99432	99453	99428	99428	Herberts	251	“ If that has been any player ’s experience , I ’d like to point out how lucky he is . ”
99467	99559	99454	99455	The man	402	“ Your player should know that methamphetamine is highly addictive . And those who take it soon find they need more of the substance just to feel that same rush . Quickly they ’re needing two , three times as much to get by . And by now , the comedown is a bitch . Then a host of long - term problems start to kick in — heart trouble , high blood pressure , weight loss , increased risk of stroke , memory loss and severe tooth decay . . . ”
99573	99578	99579	99579	he	97	“ I get it , ”
99583	99590	99579	99579	he	97	“ It ’s a bad idea . ”
99591	99596	99597	99598	the doctor	2929	“ A disastrous idea , ”
99602	99642	99597	99598	the doctor	2929	“ Everyone who gets hooked on that drug ends up wishing he ’d never seen it before . Still , if that happens to anyone you know , there are people who would help a guy get off it . ”
99651	99658	99645	99645	his	97	“ That ’s good to know . ”
99659	99673	99674	99674	Mulvey	250	“ Let ’s just take it in a different direction for a second , ”
99677	99705	99674	99674	Mulvey	250	“ Somebody who took that drug before games might do so because he felt he had no other choice . Would you say that ’s a possibility ? ”
99718	99731	99645	99645	his	97	“ Maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time . ”
99732	99735	99736	99736	Mulvey	250	“ Maybe , ”
99740	99755	99736	99736	Mulvey	250	“ Or maybe he was in a rut and looking for a way out . ”
99769	99778	99779	99779	Mulvey	250	“ But there ’s always a better way , ”
99782	99845	99846	99846	he	250	“ If a guy found he could n’t keep going just the same way , there are people he could talk to about it . For example , you should know that your team psychiatrist enjoys complete doctor - patient privilege . The things a player says to him in confidence will never be repeated . Your team sports - medicine specialist , ”
99852	99871	99846	99846	he	250	“ is contractually obligated to tell management about health issues which affect an athlete ’s ability to play . ”
99879	99912	99913	99914	The shrink	2178	“ But one of the reasons Nate Kattenberger employs two physicians for his team , is to accommodate his players ’ health in a way which allows for privacy when strictly necessary . ”
99917	99920	99913	99914	The shrink	2178	“ Interesting , ”
99959	99965	99966	99967	The shrink	2178	“ In fact . . . ”
99978	100009	100010	100010	He	2178	“ I think it makes sense for the team captain and I to discuss it privately later this week . Just to be sure we ’re on the same page . ”
100073	100076	100077	100077	he	97	“ Thanks , ”
100081	100088	100077	100077	he	97	“ Thank you for your time , ”
100094	100108	100089	100089	Herberts	249	“ If you have any further questions , my door is always open . ”
100109	100115	100116	100117	the psychiatrist	2183	“ But mine is opener , ”
100421	100424	100425	100425	he	97	“ Sweetheart , ”
100445	100448	100436	100436	She	204	“ Hi . ”
100449	100452	100462	100462	he	97	“ Hi , ”
100498	100508	100481	100481	Ari	204	“ Mom , Uncle Angelo , this is Patrick . ”
100513	100526	100527	100528	the woman	731	“ Thank you for all the help you showed our baby girl , ”
100531	100534	100535	100535	Ari	204	“ Mom , ”
100543	100560	100539	100540	her mother	1277	“ Sorry , love . But I still worry , no matter how capable you are . ”
100579	100590	100569	100569	He	97	“ Are you back in the house on Hudson Street ? ”
100591	100599	100600	100600	Ari	204	“ Just got back in this afternoon , ”
100630	100635	100636	100636	he	97	“ That ’s great , ”
100647	100654	100655	100655	he	97	“ I ’d better . . . ”
100662	100665	100666	100666	Ari	204	“ Yeah , ”
100669	100682	100655	100655	he	97	“ Have a great game . Take care of yourself out there . ”
100683	100686	100687	100687	He	97	“ Thanks . ”
100715	100721	100698	100700	Ari ’s mother	2206	“ He ’s so handsome . ”
101076	101094	101095	101095	He	97	“ Guys ? Before tonight ’s game I think we need to have an emergency . . . ”
101105	101108	101109	101109	he	97	“ Retreat , ”
101113	101129	101109	101109	he	97	“ Let ’s get everybody in here , shut the door and have a talk . ”
101130	101133	101134	101134	Beacon	164	“ Okay , ”
101138	101143	101134	101134	Beacon	164	“ Who ’s missing ? ”
101210	101221	101222	101222	he	135	“ What are you playing at with your secret meeting ? ”
101287	101295	101296	101296	he	97	“ Are you willing to trust me ? ”
101299	101344	101345	101345	Coach	135	“ It all comes down to that , right ? Either I ’m still your captain , and you ’ll give me this moment to apologize to my guys . If you ca n’t do that , might as well demote me right now . ”
101357	101374	101354	101354	he	97	“ You gon na do the right thing for us ? Even when it ’s hard ? ”
101375	101378	101379	101379	he	97	“ Yeah , ”
101384	101388	101379	101379	he	97	“ I am . ”
101392	101409	101389	101389	Coach	135	“ Go ahead then . But apologize fast . We ’ve got a game to win . ”
101410	101416	101354	101354	he	97	“ Thank you , sir . ”
101509	101512	101513	101513	he	97	“ Listen , ”
101531	101576	101525	101525	he	97	“ My official stance on that picture in the Post is that it did n’t happen . But off the record I just wanted to tell you guys that I ’m sorry I embarrassed the team . It was a dumbass thing to do . ”
101600	101622	101623	101623	he	97	“ I ’m pretty sure we ’ve already seen the end of it , but I wanted to say that anyway , ”
101626	101742	101623	101623	he	97	“ I hope we can all get past it . In the meantime I want to tell you something I learned the hard way this week . If you think there ’s something about this job you feel you ca n’t handle , there ’s probably a smart way and a dumb way to deal with it . Do n’t be like me . Take the smart way . Find someone in the organization to talk to . I did n’t do that , and now my name — and the team ’s name — is in the fucking Post . If I ’d gone to someone trustworthy , it all could have been avoided . ”
101743	101746	101747	101747	Beacon	164	“ Well , ”
101752	101784	101749	101749	his	164	“ Some of us do stupid shit and just have n’t been caught . So not every guy in this room is hating on you right now . I ’m not . ”
101785	101790	101791	101791	Castro	109	“ Sucks , though , ”
101794	101818	101791	101791	Castro	109	“ If we make it to the play - offs , someone ’s gon na say it ’s because we ’re all doping . ”
101854	101862	101863	101863	he	97	“ I sure am sorry for that , ”
101867	101875	101863	101863	he	97	“ Wish I could undo the damage . ”
101892	101910	101886	101886	his	110	“ Is there anything we can do ? I mean — any way we can help you ? ”
101944	101963	101934	101934	he	97	“ No , man . I ’m in a better place now . But I appreciate the question . ”
101991	101997	101998	101998	he	97	“ Any questions for me ? ”
102006	102043	102044	102044	He	97	“ All right . I just want to add that if you are ever on the fence about asking for any kind of help , run it by me . I wo n’t tell a soul . ”
102063	102073	102055	102055	Crikey	179	“ Who ’s fighting tonight — you or me ? ”
102094	102102	102081	102081	he	97	“ We can play it by ear ? ”
102103	102128	102129	102129	O’Doul	97	“ All right . You and I did n’t spar yesterday . I do n’t know if I have this guy figured out yet . ”
102135	102163	102164	102164	He	97	“ I ’ll take him . I do n’t mind . He ’ll be looking for me anyway . You can get the next one , maybe . ”
102182	102191	102192	102192	Trevi	110	“ Anyone wanna kick the soccer ball around ? ”
102221	102228	102208	102208	O’Doul	97	“ Can I ask you something ? ”
102239	102249	102208	102208	O’Doul	97	“ Was it the fighting that got to you ? ”
102250	102255	102256	102256	He	97	“ Uh . . . ”
102264	102302	102256	102256	He	97	“ It was a lot of things . But that ’s a big one . It sort of consumed all my focus , trying to figure out how to stay healthy and still do battle every night . ”
102308	102343	102305	102305	his	164	“ Do n’t know how you do it , man — ten years of stepping in front of somebody else ’s fist . I ’m a bag of bruises just from the game itself . ”
102344	102352	102353	102353	he	164	“ The things we do for money , ”
102487	102494	102495	102495	Castro	109	“ This one goes to eleven , ”
102791	102805	102806	102806	Trekowski	103	“ You wanna throw down now ? Whatever floats your boat , man . ”
102817	102830	102806	102806	Trekowski	103	“ Got ta fight you before they fire your ass for doping . ”
102831	102859	102860	102860	O’Doul	97	“ Uh - huh . Go ahead . I ’m so looped up right now , I fucking love pain . You ’re doing me a favor . ”
102929	102935	102920	102920	he	97	“ This what you want ? ”
103051	103055	103056	103057	the trainer	764	“ You okay ? ”
103066	103070	103056	103057	the trainer	764	“ Never better . ”
103117	103124	103125	103125	Castro	109	“ Fire up the Katt Phone ! ”
103128	103146	103125	103125	Castro	109	“ I want my gold star . Nate can tattoo it on my ass after that game . ”
103147	103154	103155	103155	Trevi	110	“ Fuck , I ’m tired , ”
103158	103181	103155	103155	Trevi	110	“ But it was totally worth it . Someone carry me to Grimaldi ’s . I need a slice and a beer . ”
103182	103187	103190	103190	himself	97	“ Tell you what , ”
103193	103203	103190	103190	himself	97	“ I ’ll order ten pies to my place . ”
103204	103208	103209	103209	Castro	109	“ Your place ? ”
103212	103223	103209	103209	Castro	109	“ Like , your apartment ? Does it really exist ? ”
103224	103241	103243	103243	he	109	“ Yeah , smartass . There wo n’t be enough chairs , but it ’ll work . ”
103248	103257	103243	103243	he	109	“ I ’d like you all to come . ”
103269	103299	103265	103266	Leo Trevi	110	“ I ’ll bring a case of beer . And do n’t worry , Castro , I ’ll make sure there ’s a light beer in there for you . ”
103323	103333	103334	103334	she	119	“ What favor do you need now , Doulie ? ”
103344	103374	103341	103341	He	97	“ I need to feed two dozen players in my apartment ASAP . How would you do that if you were me ? How late does Grimaldi ’s deliver ? ”
103375	103385	103319	103319	he	97	“ Nice of you to give me some notice . ”
103386	103392	103341	103341	He	97	“ Yeah , I know . ”
103393	103405	103406	103406	she	119	“ Here ’s what I ’m going to do for you , ”
103409	103461	103406	103406	she	119	“ I ’ll call Grimaldi ’s myself and beg , because the team puts a lot of money in their pocket . The delivery will show up at ten fifteen because they close soon after that , but I ’ll warn your building ’s concierge in case it beats you home . ”
103462	103467	103468	103468	he	2273	“ I owe you , ”
103471	103478	103468	103468	he	2273	“ No kidding , hot stuff . ”
103479	103488	103406	103406	she	119	“ Do you need my credit card number ? ”
103489	103498	103406	103406	she	119	“ I have it memorized . Anything else ? ”
103499	103520	103521	103521	She	2274	“ Just that you ’re a goddess , and feel free to come up and have a slice with us . ”
103524	103548	103549	103549	She	2274	“ I will . But now let me go so I can grovel to the restaurant for your insta - dinner . Bye . ”
103617	103626	103627	103627	he	97	“ You said there were n’t enough chairs , ”
103635	103652	103627	103627	he	97	“ But you ’re right — it does n’t matter . Nice rug . Nice everything . ”
103653	103656	103657	103657	he	97	“ Thanks , ”
103676	103687	103669	103669	He	110	“ Should I run out for paper plates and cups ? ”
103688	103702	103703	103703	Trevi	110	“ You do n’t have to . I have a lot of dishes . ”
103718	103727	103703	103703	Trevi	110	“ Leave the door open for . . . ”
103728	103731	103732	103732	Georgia	104	“ Hi ! ”
103738	103768	103732	103732	Georgia	104	“ I brought margarita mix . Because I ca n’t visit this place without drinking tequila . Too bad Ari ’s not around tonight to mix it for me . ”
103812	103815	103816	103816	he	110	“ Thanks , ”
103819	103827	103816	103816	he	110	“ There ’ll be more , too . ”
103885	103890	103880	103880	Everyone	2611	“ It ’s open ! ”
104087	104092	104093	104093	Beacon	164	“ Pizza and beer , ”
104096	104105	104093	104093	Beacon	164	“ There ’s no better way to refuel . ”
104106	104115	104116	104116	Castro	109	“ This is more relaxing than the bar , ”
104119	104130	104116	104116	Castro	109	“ But the puck bunnies ca n’t find me here . ”
104131	104138	104139	104139	Trevi	164	“ They ’re not looking anyway , ”
104143	104150	104151	104151	Castro	109	“ Shut it , Mr. Engaged , ”
104154	104164	104151	104151	Castro	109	“ We do n’t all have the perfect girlfriend . ”
104165	104171	104172	104172	Georgia	104	“ How am I perfect ? ”
104178	104197	104172	104172	Georgia	104	“ Make it good or I ’ll whisper to the PuckeredUp blog that you have a tiny penis . ”
104219	104226	104216	104216	his	109	“ Get over here , Castro , ”
104238	104248	104227	104227	Jimbo	138	“ It ’s your turn at Call of Duty . ”
104255	104284	104249	104249	O’Doul	97	“ Who needs a beer ? I ’m throwing you all out in ninety minutes , though . Got to get some rest before we fly to Tampa . ”
104482	104490	104469	104470	Uncle Angelo	248	“ It ’s yours already , honey . ”
104491	104500	104502	104502	her	204	“ I do n’t know what to say , ”
104505	104517	104502	104502	her	204	“ Say you ’ll look after it , that ’s all . ”
104562	104576	104577	104578	her mother	1277	“ Maybe someday you ’ll be able to afford to renovate the kitchen , ”
104581	104607	104577	104578	her mother	1277	“ If you took out that wall , opening it up to the dining room , you ’d have more light throughout the main floor . ”
104608	104614	104615	104615	she	204	“ That would look spectacular , ”
104618	104636	104637	104638	her mom	2114	“ When you have children you ’ll need a safety gate at the top of the steps , ”
104641	104657	104637	104638	her mom	2114	“ And maybe a carpet runner on the stairs . They ’re a bit slick . ”
104658	104674	104675	104675	Ari	204	“ Does n’t seem like I ’ll be needing to worry about that anytime soon , ”
104684	104699	104675	104675	Ari	204	“ You never know . You and that Patrick fellow would make pretty babies . ”
104700	104709	104710	104710	she	204	“ That ’s not really on the table , ”
104723	104729	104730	104731	her mom	2114	“ I do n’t know , ”
104734	104754	104730	104731	her mom	2114	“ He ’d look pretty good on the table . Or up against a wall , or . . . ”
104755	104758	104759	104759	She	204	“ Mother ! ”
104762	104779	104759	104759	She	204	“ Sorry . But with a body like that , a girl could get carried away . ”
104991	104999	105000	105001	her mother	1277	“ So tell me more about Patrick , ”
105051	105066	105039	105039	she	204	“ Patrick is complicated . He has n’t had an easy time of it . ”
105067	105080	105081	105082	her mother	1277	“ But is he a good man ? Does he love you ? ”
105085	105092	105081	105082	her mother	1277	“ Those are the important questions . ”
105118	105124	105125	105125	she	204	“ Vince loved me once , ”
105128	105136	105125	105125	she	204	“ And look how that turned out . ”
105150	105183	105137	105138	Her mother	1277	“ You were both young and foolish . You ’re wiser now . You can see past a man ’s quick smile . What do you see when you look at him ? ”
105212	105217	105218	105218	she	204	“ He ’s sturdy , ”
105221	105225	105218	105218	she	204	“ But troubled . ”
105226	105233	105234	105235	her mother	1277	“ We are all troubled sometimes , ”
105246	105275	105276	105277	Her mother	1277	“ You are awfully supportive of a man you met once for thirty seconds . I know you want grandchildren but let ’s not get ahead of ourselves . ”
105280	105321	105276	105277	Her mother	1277	“ You ’re right , I do n’t know Patrick . But I can tell he matters to you , and that ’s why I like him . My girl has excellent judgment . He must be worth the trouble . ”
105322	105378	105383	105384	her mother	1277	“ How can you say that ? I mean — I appreciate the loyalty , Mom . But if my judgment were sound we would n’t be sitting here together right now trying to recover from my ex ’s murder in my presence . This year my life has been like a television crime drama . ”
105379	105382	105383	105384	her mother	1277	“ Sweetheart , ”
105400	105475	105393	105393	Patrick	97	“ You do have good judgment . You ’ve also made good friends like Rebecca and Georgia . You are well loved by an entire hockey team . You work hard and you live within your means . Just because it took you a little too long to leave Vince does n’t mean you should n’t trust yourself again . Be kind to my Ariana . She deserves kindness from you and everyone else . ”
105483	105488	105491	105491	she	204	“ Be kind to yourself ”
105507	105525	105526	105527	her mother	1277	“ If he ’s not the man for you , then you ’ll make the right decision , ”
105530	105547	105526	105527	her mother	1277	“ But if he is , do n’t fear it . I have faith in you . ”
105548	105554	105555	105555	she	204	“ Thank you , Mom , ”
105559	105583	105526	105527	her mother	1277	“ You ’re welcome . Now eat your salad because I see real Brooklyn cheesecake in that dessert case and I want some . ”
105638	105650	105651	105651	Henry	114	“ I ’m putting O’Doul back on your schedule tomorrow morning , ”
105655	105670	105651	105651	Henry	114	“ He ’s doing pretty well but we have to keep that hip supple . ”
105671	105675	105676	105676	she	204	“ Of course , ”
105685	105689	105690	105690	she	204	“ Who else ? ”
105787	105799	105806	105806	his	2337	“ Ari ? Can I talk to you for a second ? ”
105879	105884	105885	105885	he	2337	“ Can we talk ? ”
105888	105891	105894	105894	herself	98	“ Sure , ”
105897	105907	105908	105908	she	98	“ But do n’t you have to . . . ”
105925	105932	105915	105915	He	2337	“ We ’re done in there . ”
105962	105970	105959	105959	his	2337	“ Where do you want to talk ? ”
105998	106009	106010	106010	he	2337	“ How do you feel about linguini with clam sauce ? ”
106013	106016	106010	106010	he	2337	“ Hmm ? ”
106046	106055	106041	106041	His	2337	“ Actually , I ’m allergic to shellfish . ”
106060	106063	106041	106041	His	2337	“ Figures . ”
106064	106067	106068	106068	He	2337	“ Why ? ”
106077	106088	106070	106070	his	2337	“ How do you feel about ice skating , then ? ”
106089	106094	106041	106041	His	2337	“ Skating ? Me ? ”
106095	106112	106113	106113	He	2337	“ Yes you . You work at an ice rink . Two of them , actually . ”
106116	106130	106113	106113	He	2337	“ Have you set foot on the ice since you started working here ? ”
106131	106141	106142	106142	He	2337	“ I have n’t skated since I was twelve . ”
106147	106159	106142	106142	He	2337	“ Come on , then . No time like the present . ”
106175	106182	106183	106183	she	98	“ I do n’t have skates , ”
106187	106222	106183	106183	she	98	“ Not a problem — Georgia started giving free ice time to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Brooklyn . She has a whole stash of loaner skates now . I ’ll show you . ”
106268	106272	106273	106273	Patrick	97	“ Girly skates ? ”
106276	106287	106273	106273	Patrick	97	“ Do n’t you want to learn the right way ? ”
106288	106297	106298	106298	she	98	“ These are what I ’m used to , ”
106301	106316	106298	106298	she	98	“ You do n’t want me to fall down and break something , right ? ”
106317	106339	106340	106340	She	98	“ Good point , rookie . Have a seat on the bench and I ’ll be right back to help you . ”
106454	106461	106447	106447	He	97	“ You did that very well . ”
106462	106475	106476	106476	He	97	“ I ’ve been tying my own shoes since kindergarten , thanks . ”
106482	106490	106491	106491	she	98	“ You ’re still wearing your suit , ”
106495	106527	106491	106491	she	98	“ Well , you did n’t get a chance to change , so I figure it ’s only fair . You can hold onto me if you feel shaky , okay ? ”
106528	106534	106535	106535	she	98	“ Was that your plan ? ”
106549	106568	106569	106569	He	97	“ The thought did cross my mind . But I really just wanted to spend time with you . ”
106590	106642	106569	106569	He	97	“ I missed you , Ari . The only reason I spend time with you is because you ’re important to me . You ’re everything that I want , and everything I need . You already have my heart , and I do n’t want it back . You understand ? ”
106654	106657	106658	106658	He	97	“ Ready ? ”
106689	106698	106699	106699	she	98	“ I forgot that I ’d be taller , ”
106705	106711	106712	106712	he	97	“ But so am I , ”
106768	106773	106774	106774	she	98	“ Let ’s skate , ”
106790	106795	106796	106796	He	97	“ Right this way . ”
106839	106848	106849	106849	she	98	“ We ’re going to scuff it up , ”
106853	106858	106849	106849	she	98	“ Will anyone care ? ”
106859	106868	106869	106869	He	97	“ Not much . Come on , now . ”
106949	106952	106953	106953	he	97	“ See ? ”
106956	106966	106953	106953	he	97	“ You got it . You ’re really stable . ”
106967	106970	106971	106971	she	98	“ Mmmhmm , ”
106974	106985	106986	106986	She	98	“ Let ’s see how I do on my own . ”
107086	107094	107095	107095	Patrick	97	“ You ’re . . . wow , ”
107105	107108	107095	107095	Patrick	97	“ Nice . ”
107157	107160	107131	107131	she	98	“ Jesus . ”
107292	107299	107300	107300	she	204	“ It was n’t that bad , ”
107325	107328	107329	107329	he	97	“ Baby , ”
107335	107345	107329	107329	he	97	“ You kill me . I swear to God . ”
107356	107387	107346	107346	He	97	“ All I do is try to impress you , and it ’s impossible . Because you ’re the most impressive person I ever met . I ’m so screwed . ”
107414	107422	107423	107423	he	97	“ I ’m so gone for you , ”
107430	107458	107423	107423	he	97	“ I ’ve got it bad . It might take me years to convince you I ’m a good guy , but I ’ll never stop trying . ”
107459	107466	107467	107467	She	204	“ The thing is . . . ”
107477	107482	107467	107467	She	204	“ I believe you . ”
107490	107494	107467	107467	She	204	“ You do ? ”
107495	107498	107499	107499	She	204	“ Yeah . ”
107767	107770	107761	107761	he	97	“ Easy . ”
107798	107805	107806	107806	she	204	“ You dragged me out here , ”
107814	107819	107806	107806	she	204	“ Let ’s skate . ”
107820	107839	107892	107892	His	97	“ All right . Show me some more of your fancy moves . You did some figure skating ? ”
107840	107868	107892	107892	His	97	“ Yeah . In middle school . But then it got really competitive and I stopped . I liked the skating more than I liked the pressure . ”
107869	107872	107873	107873	She	204	“ Ah . ”
107878	107891	107873	107873	She	204	“ Come on , you can be my partner . Back crossovers . ”
107909	107924	107892	107892	His	97	“ Do I get to hold your butt and hoist you over my head ? ”
107925	107936	107892	107892	His	97	“ I do n’t think we ’re up to that . ”
107937	107944	107945	107945	He	97	“ Skate with me , sweetheart . ”
108019	108024	108025	108025	he	97	“ That ’s it , ”
108035	108041	108025	108025	he	97	“ I ’ve got you . ”
108067	108070	108071	108071	she	204	“ Fancy , ”
108081	108088	108089	108089	He	97	“ I ’ll show you fancy . ”
108165	108170	108171	108171	she	204	“ That was terrifying , ”
108191	108203	108186	108186	He	97	“ I ’m hoping for a ten from the Russian judge . ”
108204	108207	108186	108186	He	97	“ Omigod ! ”
108214	108236	108186	108186	He	97	“ You guys are adorable . I could kill myself for not having my Katt Phone handy . . . Whoa ! ”
108257	108264	108265	108265	She	204	“ Becca ! Are you okay ? ”
108278	108281	108265	108265	She	204	“ Fuck ! ”
108282	108285	108286	108286	Ari	204	“ Here . ”
108314	108320	108321	108321	Becca	119	“ This is so embarrassing , ”
108331	108364	108321	108321	Becca	119	“ You two were having so much fun , though . I realized I ’d never set foot on this ice in two years . But I should have gone for three . ”
108365	108370	108371	108371	Ari	204	“ Are you okay ? ”
108378	108382	108383	108384	her friend	629	“ Of course , ”
108406	108417	108418	108418	Becca	119	“ Just humor me and sit down for a minute . ”
108441	108449	108450	108450	she	119	“ I was just looking for you , ”
108457	108496	108450	108450	she	119	“ Henry said he forgot to ask you in the meeting whether your hands are okay for a full slate of massage appointments tomorrow . He could n’t find you but your phone was still in the building . ”
108497	108503	108504	108504	she	119	“ My hands are fine , ”
108508	108515	108504	108504	she	119	“ Did you hit your head ? ”
108516	108519	108520	108520	Becca	119	“ No . ”
108525	108545	108520	108520	Becca	119	“ I ’m fine , I swear . And I do n’t want to interrupt date night or whatever . ”
108582	108591	108592	108592	she	204	“ We were just about done skating anyway , ”
108597	108604	108592	108592	she	204	“ Want to get some dinner ? ”
108605	108608	108609	108609	Becca	119	“ Nope . ”
108614	108634	108609	108609	Becca	119	“ But I want you two to get some dinner . Together , in case that was n’t clear . ”
108635	108638	108639	108639	Ari	204	“ Subtle , ”
108642	108649	108639	108639	Ari	204	“ I do n’t do subtle . ”
108660	108667	108650	108650	Becca	119	“ See you in the morning ! ”
108679	108685	108668	108668	Patrick	97	“ Want to get dinner ? ”
108686	108689	108690	108690	Ari	204	“ Subtle , ”
108697	108705	108694	108694	he	97	“ Sure . Let ’s do that . ”
108711	108725	108708	108708	his	97	“ It ’s only four thirty , though . Too early for dinner . ”
108726	108729	108730	108730	Ari	204	“ Hmm . ”
108738	108746	108730	108730	Ari	204	“ How will we pass the time ? ”
108759	108766	108752	108752	Patrick	97	“ I have a few ideas . ”
108767	108771	108752	108752	Patrick	97	“ So do I. ”
108804	108817	108818	108818	she	204	“ It ’s been a while since I cooked a good meal , ”
108821	108826	108818	108818	she	204	“ I miss it . ”
108863	108869	108870	108870	he	97	“ Your kitchen or mine ? ”
108881	108903	108870	108870	he	97	“ Hmm . You have that awesome Wolf range that I covet . But do you have a good sauté pan ? ”
108904	108914	108870	108870	he	97	“ Probably . David and Dexter liked to cook . ”
108921	108940	108870	108870	he	97	“ All right . I ’ll risk it . Hang on — we need a bottle of wine . ”
109048	109056	109057	109057	she	204	“ Where did we put those olives ? ”
109102	109105	109106	109106	she	204	“ Mmm , ”
109112	109118	109106	109106	she	204	“ What ’s that for ? ”
109130	109137	109106	109106	she	204	“ Do I need a reason ? ”
109138	109141	109142	109142	Her	204	“ No . ”
109147	109157	109142	109142	Her	204	“ I just like you , that ’s all . ”
109203	109218	109219	109219	she	204	“ These get chopped a bit , and mixed with the tomatoes and garlic , ”
109222	109236	109219	109219	she	204	“ Then I add the breadcrumbs and douse it all with olive oil . ”
109277	109283	109271	109271	his	97	“ That is . . . ”
109289	109293	109284	109284	She	204	“ Really distracting . ”
109310	109315	109316	109316	he	97	“ Should I stop ? ”
109324	109329	109316	109316	he	97	“ Um . . . ”
109351	109354	109355	109355	she	204	“ Ungggh , ”
109363	109371	109355	109355	she	204	“ Put the knife down , sweetheart . ”
109378	109382	109372	109372	He	97	“ Good idea . ”
109411	109421	109401	109401	He	97	“ I ’m in the mood to spoil you . ”
109422	109432	109437	109437	he	97	“ I ’m in the mood to let you . ”
109488	109494	109495	109495	He	97	“ Oh geez . . . ”
109537	109547	109550	109550	she	204	“ Put your hands on the counter , Ariana . ”
109669	109675	109676	109676	she	204	“ You ’re killing me , ”
109702	109712	109713	109713	he	97	“ I ’m too hungry to wait for dinner , ”
109733	109739	109740	109740	He	97	“ I want . . . ”
109754	109758	109740	109740	He	97	“ An appetizer . ”

109876	109881	109882	109882	he	97	“ What about dinner ? ”
109885	109888	109889	109889	She	204	“ Later . ”
109921	109927	109928	109928	he	97	“ Take off your shirt , ”
109935	109953	109954	109954	Ari	204	“ The bra , too . Then I want you on your knees . In Balasana pose . ”
109963	109973	109954	109954	Ari	204	“ Wow . Look at you , speaking Sanskrit ! ”
109974	109983	109984	109984	He	97	“ It ’s the only pose I know . ”
109990	110005	109984	109984	He	97	“ Whenever you demonstrate it , I want to climb on top of you . ”
110006	110016	110017	110017	She	204	“ I love hearing what ’s in your head . ”
110049	110053	110031	110031	She	204	“ Right now ? ”
110054	110059	110066	110066	she	204	“ God , yes . ”
110131	110134	110135	110135	he	97	“ Whew , ”
110180	110191	110192	110192	He	97	“ So beautiful . Even better than in my dreams . ”
110258	110263	110264	110264	he	97	“ Just like this , ”
110287	110296	110275	110275	He	97	“ You ’re open and ready for me . ”
110303	110315	110297	110297	She	204	“ I ’m not sure I get it . Demonstrate again . ”
110329	110339	110318	110318	his	97	“ Stay there . I have to suit up . ”
110396	110403	110404	110404	She	204	“ You see anything you like ? ”
110409	110418	110404	110404	She	204	“ A yogi does n’t fish for compliments . ”
110419	110429	110430	110430	He	97	“ Never said I was any good at yoga . ”
110462	110467	110468	110468	he	97	“ You missed me , ”
110476	110482	110468	110468	he	97	“ Enough with the talking . ”
110697	110711	110712	110712	she	204	“ You . . . we . . . so good . . . ”
110718	110722	110723	110723	he	97	“ I know , ”
110726	110733	110723	110723	he	97	“ Love the way you feel . ”
110816	110828	110829	110829	Ari	204	“ Balasana is supposed to be a resting , restorative position , ”
110843	110851	110852	110852	She	204	“ Well . I feel completely restored . ”
110870	110883	110884	110884	she	204	“ Good thing I had n’t put dinner in the oven yet , ”
110888	110895	110884	110884	she	204	“ Shall we finish it now ? ”
110940	110948	110949	110949	he	97	“ I still owe you an explanation , ”
110968	110976	110959	110959	She	204	“ What do you wish to explain ? ”
110977	111051	110959	110959	She	204	“ I already told you that I only met Vince once before he threw a brick through your window . I did n’t know you two were connected . Did n’t care , either . I saw those texts , and I did n’t know who he was . When I ran over there and he was threatening you , I just wanted to shut him down , no matter who he was . ”
111052	111055	111056	111056	She	2379	“ Okay . ”
111060	111064	110959	110959	She	204	“ I understand . ”
111065	111118	111119	111119	He	2379	“ I mean , when he sent that picture to the Bruisers ’ office , he was telling me to back the fuck off . That he could damage me . But I was n’t going to listen . And it did n’t have a thing to do with the . . . ”
111124	111132	111121	111121	his	2379	“ Junk I bought from him once . ”
111133	111140	111141	111141	she	2379	“ Why ’d you do it ? ”
111155	111217	111121	111121	his	2379	“ Another player — a competitor — told me they ’d make me feel invincible . And he was right . But buying them made me feel like a lowlife . And I spent my whole adulthood trying not to be that lowlife kid from the group home , right ? So after that one time I did n’t buy again . ”
111218	111226	111227	111227	she	2379	“ You ’re not taking anything now , ”
111230	111253	111227	111227	she	2379	“ No , baby . I ’d tell you if I was . But that ’s why I passed my drug test . ”
111254	111262	111121	111121	his	2379	“ Those things are easy to pass . ”
111263	111275	111227	111227	she	2379	“ If they are , I do n’t want to know . ”
111283	111306	111227	111227	she	2379	“ Thank you for telling me . If we ’re going to be together , you ca n’t take that stuff again . ”
111307	111310	111311	111311	He	2380	“ Aw . ”
111316	111325	111326	111326	He	2380	“ That ’s a hell of an incentive . ”
111331	111340	111341	111341	she	2379	“ Some people ca n’t stop , though , ”
111345	111352	111341	111341	she	2379	“ Even if they mean to . ”
111353	111386	111311	111311	He	2380	“ The team doctors told me I was lucky not to get sucked in right away . They said to stay away from that shit because I might not be lucky again . ”
111387	111395	111447	111447	her	2379	“ And you ’re going to listen ? ”
111396	111412	111341	111341	she	2379	“ Yeah . I am . I ’m doing good , sweetheart . I promise . ”
111413	111416	111417	111417	she	2379	“ Okay , ”
111420	111425	111417	111417	she	2379	“ I trust you . ”
111430	111444	111445	111445	She	2379	“ What else do you need from me ? I want to know . ”
111458	111482	111445	111445	She	2379	“ See , you ’re not going to like my demands . There ’s a reason I tried to stay away from you . ”
111483	111490	111455	111455	her	2379	“ Tell me why that is . ”
111499	111535	111491	111491	Ari	204	“ We need to be subtle at work . I do n’t mean secretive . But the job really matters to me , and I have to act like a professional . So no touching . ”
111536	111539	111540	111540	He	2380	“ Hmm . ”
111548	111566	111540	111540	He	2380	“ Okay . I might need to do some extra touching in private to tide me over . ”
111567	111575	111491	111491	Ari	204	“ That ’s not a deal breaker . ”
111576	111582	111583	111583	Ari	204	“ What else , then ? ”
111593	111598	111583	111583	Ari	204	“ What is it ? ”
111605	111623	111602	111602	her	204	“ Nothing . I think I should get up and take our dinner out of the oven . ”
111624	111628	111629	111629	he	2380	“ All right , ”
111639	111649	111629	111629	he	2380	“ Can I pour you a glass of wine ? ”
111650	111656	111602	111602	her	204	“ I ’d love one . ”
111715	111725	111726	111726	Patrick	97	“ Meet me out for coffee and a pastry , ”
111733	111742	111726	111726	Patrick	97	“ You like that cookie place , right ? ”
111743	111746	111747	111747	she	204	“ Okay , ”
111751	111756	111757	111757	he	2380	“ That was easy , ”
111788	111795	111757	111757	he	2380	“ it ’s a bad idea . ”
111833	111847	111824	111824	she	204	“ I ’ll meet you at One Girl Cookies in half an hour . ”
111848	111854	111855	111855	he	2380	“ I ’ll be there , ”
111904	111907	111908	111908	she	262	“ Hey , ”
111917	111922	111913	111913	Lola	262	“ Hi , Ari ! ”
111960	111964	111965	111965	he	97	“ Missed you , ”
111968	111985	111965	111965	he	97	“ Well I ’m back . Have you had the chocolate croissant ? They ’re awesome . ”
111986	111991	111992	111992	he	97	“ Two chocolate croissants , ”
112008	112014	111992	111992	he	97	“ And a large coffee . ”
112046	112057	112058	112058	she	204	“ I can buy my own food , you know , ”
112070	112074	112058	112058	she	204	“ Humor me . ”
112078	112089	112075	112075	He	97	“ I ’ve never had anyone to spoil before now . ”
112112	112122	112123	112123	His	97	“ Well , if you put it that way . ”
112132	112172	112173	112173	He	97	“ I ’m trying not to scare you , sweetheart . But you ’re it for me . There is n’t anything I would n’t give you , or do for you . So have a croissant on me . ”
112196	112199	112200	112200	Lola	262	“ Ahem , ”
112203	112209	112200	112200	Lola	262	“ Your coffees are ready . ”
112230	112234	112215	112215	Ari	204	“ Thank you . ”
112286	112291	112292	112292	she	204	“ Do n’t laugh , ”
112305	112329	112292	112292	she	204	“ I told you I wanted to be subtle . That was less than ten hours ago and we ’ve already blown it . ”
112337	112377	112330	112330	His	97	“ I ’m sorry , baby . It ’s all my fault , but now I ’m going to say good morning to Nate now . Come with me , okay ? There ’s no point in acting guilty . ”
112479	112482	112483	112483	Patrick	97	“ Morning , ”
112489	112496	112483	112483	Patrick	97	“ Good morning Patrick . Ariana . ”
112497	112500	112501	112501	He	97	“ Hi . ”
112546	112565	112535	112535	her	132	“ Nice show you put on over there . I did n’t know you were dating a player . ”
112616	112628	112601	112601	He	97	“ Lauren , it ’s always a pleasure to see you . ”
112634	112660	112601	112601	He	97	“ . . . But Ari is about to kill us both right now , because she ’s skittish about spending time with a player . ”
112661	112666	112667	112667	Lauren	132	“ She should be , ”
112678	112703	112667	112667	Lauren	132	“ Because that always ends so well . I ’m heading into the office now . We ’re all set , right , Nathan ? ”
112736	112744	112716	112716	He	101	“ Have a seat , you two . ”
112816	112824	112813	112813	Lauren	132	“ She does n’t pull her punches . ”
112825	112829	112830	112830	O’Doul	97	“ Never has , ”
112834	112842	112843	112843	Nate	101	“ She ’s a great office manager , ”
112846	112858	112843	112843	Nate	101	“ Everyone has different methods , but Lauren rules through intimidation . ”
112868	112906	112907	112907	He	101	“ Try not to be too irritated with her . Lauren is out of sorts because I asked her to work in Brooklyn for the duration of the Bruisers season . She ’s not happy with me . ”
112914	112936	112907	112907	He	101	“ But you should know that I do n’t share her pessimism for whatever relationship you have with our captain here . ”
112937	112942	112943	112943	Ari	204	“ You do n’t ? ”
112960	113069	112957	112957	his	101	“ The people I employ work some of the longest hours in New York . I do n’t mean just the hockey team right before play - offs — I mean everyone at my software company , too . What kind of asshole would I be if I discouraged my employees from finding a partner at work ? Where else would my employees meet people ? I ’m not heartless , and I ’m not stupid . If workplace romances were forbidden , I ’d lose good employees to my competitors . Besides — the employees I want are the ones who know how to forge strong relationships . ”
113070	113079	113080	113080	Patrick	97	“ That is a good point , sir , ”
113145	113156	113157	113157	she	204	“ Why did you ask Lauren to work in Brooklyn ? ”
113169	113185	113161	113161	Nate	101	“ Rebecca is going to be out for a few days , if not longer . ”
113186	113190	113191	113191	Ari	204	“ She is ? ”
113195	113198	113191	113191	Ari	204	“ Why ? ”
113208	113229	113191	113191	Ari	204	“ She hit her head yesterday . She said it did n’t seem like a big deal at the time . ”
113230	113234	113235	113235	Ari	204	“ Oh god , ”
113238	113249	113235	113235	Ari	204	“ I was there . She insisted she was fine . ”
113253	113283	113250	113250	Nate	101	“ In the night she had a lot of pain , and felt really ill . Her sister took her to Brooklyn Methodist . They ’re running some tests . ”
113317	113337	113300	113300	she	119	“ That is terrible . What can I do to help ? Does she need anything in the hospital ? ”
113338	113362	113363	113363	He	97	“ That is an excellent question . When we hear more , I ’ll let you know . In the meantime . . . ”
113370	113420	113363	113363	He	97	“ Could you let your teammates know that they need to take it easy on the office until she ’s back ? I ’ve asked Lauren to step in , because she ’s terrific in a crisis . But things wo n’t go as smoothly for a little while . ”
113421	113424	113425	113425	Patrick	97	“ Sure , ”
113428	113464	113425	113425	Patrick	97	“ Though I ’m probably the worst offender . I ’ll tell my guys they have to take a little extra care with travel arrangements and receipts . To not make anyone chase ’em down . ”
113470	113485	113465	113465	Nate	101	“ And how are you feeling ? Do you need any additional time off ? ”
113492	113519	113486	113486	She	204	“ We ’ll be back to yoga tomorrow morning . No worries . You and the rest of your team have been extraordinarily helpful to me . ”
113520	113528	113529	113529	He	101	“ I ’m happy to hear that . ”
113532	113553	113554	113554	He	101	“ All right . I ’m heading into Manhattan , but I ’ll see you both at the game tonight . ”
113621	113626	113627	113627	Georgia	104	“ Hi , gorgeous ! ”
113634	113640	113627	113627	Georgia	104	“ Thanks for stopping by . ”
113641	113646	113647	113647	She	204	“ What ’s up ? ”
113656	113664	113647	113647	She	204	“ I have a favor to ask . ”
113665	113668	113672	113672	her	629	“ Anything . ”
113683	113712	113672	113672	her	629	“ Would you be a bridesmaid in my wedding ? I know it ’s kind of a pain , with the fussy dresses and all the . . . ”
113713	113716	113717	113717	Ari	204	“ Yes , ”
113721	113728	113717	113717	Ari	204	“ I ’d be happy to . ”
113735	113756	113729	113729	Georgia	104	“ Really ? Thank you ! I hate asking for things like this . Not everybody likes pomp and circumstance . ”
113757	113773	113672	113672	her	629	“ It would be my pleasure . And do you need help with the planning ? ”
113796	113809	113729	113729	Georgia	104	“ I do n’t want you to worry because Becca is sick . ”
113810	113819	113820	113820	Georgia	104	“ I ’m not worried about the wedding , ”
113823	113854	113820	113820	Georgia	104	“ It will be fine . But I am worried about Becca . I ’m heading over to her apartment right now , actually . Want to come with me ? ”
113855	113875	113820	113820	Georgia	104	“ Of course . I just have to swing through the GM ’s office to get my pay stub . ”
113876	113880	113881	113881	Georgia	104	“ Me too , ”
113901	113906	113884	113884	She	104	“ Let ’s go . ”
113956	113960	113961	113961	she	104	“ Thank you , ”
113972	113975	113976	113976	Lauren	132	“ So , ”
113986	114011	113976	113976	Lauren	132	“ Doulie , huh ? Interesting pick . I always thought of him as a cold fish , but I think he likes you . ”
114053	114080	114081	114081	Lauren	132	“ Lauren , I did n’t appreciate your making a big deal of it in front of Nate this morning . That was embarrassing to me . ”
114086	114099	114083	114083	her	132	“ He does n’t care . Hell , that man loves gossip . ”
114100	114103	114104	114104	She	132	“ Well . ”
114109	114126	114127	114127	Lauren	132	“ In Becca ’s experience , even when she ’s just joking around with . . . ”
114131	114143	114127	114127	Lauren	132	“ Stop right there . Rebecca ’s experience is not relevant . ”
114144	114147	114148	114148	Georgia	104	“ Why ? ”
114173	114183	114157	114157	Lauren	132	“ Really ? You have n’t figured it out ? ”
114191	114202	114203	114203	Lauren	132	“ Nate gets crazy when anyone flirts . With Becca . ”
114206	114212	114213	114213	She	132	“ Wake up , ladies . ”
114221	114266	114213	114213	She	132	“ Nate has it bad for little Miss Perky . I ’ve been watching that little charade for years now . It never gets old . I just hope Rebecca recovers quickly , because I can not wait to get out of this building . ”
114317	114328	114329	114329	Lauren	132	“ Lauren ? Why do you hate hockey so much ? ”
114334	114347	114348	114348	She	132	“ You really are n’t up on your gossip , are you ? ”
114358	114376	114377	114377	Ari	204	“ Thanks for stopping by . I ’ll see you both at the game tonight , unfortunately . ”
114390	114396	114397	114397	Georgia	104	“ What just happened there ? ”
114401	114407	114408	114408	Ari	204	“ I do n’t know , ”
114412	114418	114408	114408	Ari	204	“ Maybe she ’s crazy . ”
114440	114451	114452	114452	Georgia	104	“ Let ’s order an early dinner at Becca ’s , ”
114455	114465	114452	114452	Georgia	104	“ That way we can make sure she eats . ”
114466	114470	114452	114452	Georgia	104	“ All right . ”
114595	114598	114600	114600	Georgia	104	“ Huh , ”
114602	114607	114609	114609	Ari	204	“ Um . . . ”
114611	114616	114617	114617	Georgia	104	“ Early dinner elsewhere ? ”
114620	114627	114617	114617	Georgia	104	“ Good plan . My place ? ”
114628	114631	114632	114635	The two of them	998	“ Yeah ! ”
