1041	1072	1037	1038	her mother	341	“Several changes have been ordered for the Van Heusen in order to modernize it . Fingerprint entry is just one of them . Also , the elevators will be replaced . ”“Why
1074	1128	1037	1038	her mother	341	” Merina pictured the gold decorative doors with a Phoenix , the mythical bird that arose from the ashes of its predecessor , emblazoned on them . If there was a beating heart in the Van Heusen , it was that symbol . Her stomach turned . Instead of answering , Jolie continued . “
1159	1164	1201	1201	She	341	” She sighed again . “
1171	1180	1181	1181	Merina	84	”“When did you take to day - drinking ? ”
1208	1241	1201	1201	She	341	“ Sweetheart . We were going to tell you , but we wanted to make sure there really was no going back . I did n’t expect the locksmith to arrive today . ”
1254	1257	1258	1258	father	348	“ Tell me what?”“Your
1310	1352	1305	1305	Reese	97	”At that pronouncement , Jolie ’s normally sunny attitude clouded over . Merina knew the Cranes . The Crane Hotel was the biggest corporate hotel outfit in the city , the second biggest in the nation . Alexander ( better known as “
1355	1402	1403	1403	You	352	” ) and his sons ran it , local celebrities of sorts . She ’d also read about Big Crane ’s retirement and Reese ’s likely ascension to CEO.But none of that mattered . There was only one newly learned fact bouncing around in her brain . “
1407	1431	1434	1434	you	352	Heusen?”She needed that chair after all . She sank into it , mind blanking of everything except for one name : Reese Crane . “Why
1438	1465	1434	1434	you	352	” Merina stood up again . She could n’t sit . She could not remain still while this was happening . Correction : This had happened . “
1473	1487	1490	1490	her	91	first?”“You know we ’d never include you in our financial difficulties , Merina . ”
1494	1500	1501	1502	her mom	353	difficulties?“Bankruptcy was not an option , ”
1505	1526	1501	1502	her mom	353	“ Plus , selling gave us the best of both worlds . No financial responsibility and we keep our jobs . ”“With
1533	1556	1501	1502	her mom	353	” Her mind spun after she said it aloud . My God . They would be answering to that arrogant , idiotic … “No
1558	1570	1490	1490	her	91	” Merina shook her head as she strode past her mother . “
1576	1587	1490	1490	her	91	”And there had to be a way to undo it . “Merina
1589	1673	1674	1677	stupid , smarmy jackass	355	” her mother called after her as Merina bent and collected the discarded doorknob off the ground . She strode through the lobby , dumping the remainder of her latte in the wastebasket by the front desk , and then stomped outside . As luck would have it , the light drizzle turned into steady rain the second she marched through the crosswalk . Angry as she was , she ’d bet that steam rose off her body where the raindrops pelted her . “That
1679	1889	1674	1677	stupid , smarmy jackass	355	” she said as she pushed through a small crowd of people hustling through the crosswalk . Because seriously , who in their right mind would reconstruct the Van Heusen ? Fingerprint entry ? This was n’t a James Bond movie ! She caught a few sideways glances , but it was hard to tell if they were because she was muttering to herself like a loopy homeless person or because she was carrying a disembodied doorknob around with her . Could be both . Her parents had sold the Van Heusen to the biggest , most ostentatious hotel chain in the world . And without telling their own daughter , who also happened to be the hotel ’s manager ! How close to bankruptcy had they been ? Could n’t Merina have helped ? She ’d never know now that they ’d sneaked behind her back . How could they do this to me?Merina was as much a part of that hotel as they were . Her mother acted as if selling it was nothing more than an inconvenience . Focus . You ’re pissed at Crane . Right . Big Crane may have done her parents a favor buying it , but now that he was about to “
1893	1906	1674	1677	stupid , smarmy jackass	355	” it sounded like Reese had decided to flex his corporate muscle . “Shit
1908	2577	1490	1490	her	91	” She did n’t just do that . She did not just drown her Louboutin pumps in a deep puddle by the curb . She did n’t splurge on much , but her shoes were an indulgence . She shook the rainwater from one pump as best she could and sloshed up Rush Street to Superior , her sights set squarely on the Crane Hotel . Seventy floors of mirrored glass and as invasive as a visit to the ob - gyn . Given the choice between this monstrosity and the Van Heusen , with its warm cookies and cozy design , she could n’t believe anyone would set foot in the clinical , whitewashed Crane Hotels let alone sleep there . At the top of that ivory tower , Reese Crane perched like an evil overlord . The oldest Crane son was n’t royalty , but according to the social media and newspaper attention he sure as hell thought he was . Halfway down Superior , she folded her arms over her shirt , shuddering against the intensifying wind . She really should have grabbed her coat on her way out , but there had n’t been a lot of decision - making going into her process . She ’d made it this far , fists balled and steam billowing out of her ears , her ire having kept her warm for the relatively short walk . She should have known better . In Chicago , spring did n’t show up until summer . Finally , she stood face - to - face with the gargantuan , seventy - floor home base . The Crane was not only the premier hotel for the visiting wealthy ( and possibly uncultured , given that they stayed here ) , but it was also where Reese slept , in his very own suite on the top floor , instead of his sprawling Lake Shore Drive mansion . She would n’t be surprised if he slept right at his desk , snuggling his cell phone in one hand and a wad of money in the other . Stupid billionaires . Inside , she sucked in a generous breath and shook off her chill . At least there was no wind , and despite the chilling whitewash of furniture , rugs , and modern lighting , it was warm . But only in temperature . The Crane represented everything she hated about modern hotels . And she should know , because she ’d worked diligently alongside her parents to keep the integrity of their boutique hotel since she started running it . Her hotel was a place of rich history , beauty , and passion . This place was a tower of glass , made so that the lower echelon of the city could see in but never touch . Perfect for the likes of Reese Crane . She walked through the lobby , filled to overflowing with businesspeople of every color , shape , and size . Flashes of suits — black , gray , white — passed in a monochrome blur , as if the Crane Hotel had a dress code and each and every guest here had received the memo . Merina , in her plum silk shirt and dark gray pencil skirt and nude heels , did n’t stand out … except for the fact that she resembled a drowned rat . A few surly glances and cocked brows were her reward for rushing out into the storm . Well . Whatever . She spotted the elevator leading to Crane ’s office , catching the door as an older woman was reaching for the button . The woman with coiffed gray hair widened her eyes in alarm , a tiny dog held snuggly in her arms . Merina skated a hand down her skirt and over her hair , wiping the hollows below her eyes to ensure she did n’t go to Reese ’s office with panda eyes . “Good
2580	2734	2735	2735	I	0	” she greeted . The older woman frowned . Here was the other problem with the Crane . Its guests were as snooty as the building . Attitude reflects leadership . The doors opened only once , to deliver the woman and her dog to the forty - second floor , and then Merina rode the car to the top floor without interruption . She used the time to straighten herself in the blurry , reflective gold doors . No keys or security codes were needed to reach the top of the building . Reese Crane was probably far too smug to believe anyone would dare come up here without an appointment . She ’d heard his secretary was more like a bulldog that guarded his office . The elevator doors slid aside to reveal a woman wearing all black , her grim expression better suited for a funeral home than a hotel . “May
2739	2757	2933	2933	her	2305	” the woman asked , her words measured , curt , and not the least bit friendly . “You
2761	2776	2933	2933	her	2305	” Merina said , pleased the rain had n’t completely drowned out her rage . “
2785	2789	2782	2783	Mr. Crane	103	”“Do you have an appoin—”“No
2791	2914	2782	2783	Mr. Crane	103	” She supposed she could have made an appointment , could have called ahead , but no sense in robbing Reese Crane of the full effect of her face - to - face fury . The phone rang and the woman slid her acerbic glare away from Merina . She waited as the other woman answered a call , spoke as slowly as humanly possible , and then returned the receiver to the cradle . The woman folded her hands , waiting . Even with her nostrils flared , Merina forced a smile . There was only one way past this gatekeeper . She called up an ounce of poise — an ounce being the most she could access at the moment . “
2923	2928	2929	2930	the woman	2305	”“Ms . Van Heusen , ”
2948	2962	2937	2937	her	2305	“ You ’re here regarding the changes to the hotel , I presume . ”“You
2966	2986	2933	2933	her	2305	” Merina said , barely harnessing her anger . How come everyone was so damn calm about dismantling a town landmark?“Have
2990	3019	2933	2933	her	2305	” Crane ’s bulldog gestured one manicured hand at a group of cushy white chairs , her mouth frowning in disgust as she took in Merina ’s dishevelment . “
3029	3035	3036	3036	She	84	”“I wo n’t be sitting . ”
3087	3089	3091	3091	her	101	“ Excuse me!”Merina
3217	3222	3227	3227	her	84	“Ms . Van Heusen ! ”
3252	3258	3230	3230	Reese	101	“She ’s fine , Bobbie . ”Merina
3279	3284	3285	3285	Reese	101	“Merina , I presume . ”
3593	3603	3604	3604	he	357	“Seems this April morning is colder than you anticipated , ”
3639	3645	3646	3646	she	84	“Cut the horseshit , Crane , ”
3679	3684	3685	3685	she	84	“I heard some news , ”
3693	3700	3701	3701	she	84	“Your father purchased the Van Heusen , ”
3704	3714	3715	3715	he	357	“He added it to the family portfolio , yes , ”
3760	3787	3788	3788	She	84	“There ’s been an error . My mother is under the impression that many of the nostalgic and antique fixtures in the building will be replaced . ”
3846	3850	3851	3851	He	357	“Have a seat . ”
3947	3961	3935	3935	himself	101	“ Bobbie , Ms. Van Heusen will need a car in fifteen minutes . ”“Yes
3965	3980	3944	3944	his	357	”So he ’d deigned to carve out fifteen minutes for Merina . Lucky her . “I
3987	3996	4000	4000	he	357	”“No ? You ’re planning on walking back ? ”
4029	4031	4032	4032	She	84	“Yes . ”
4091	4098	4099	4099	he	357	“You were saying something about horseshit , ”
4135	4183	4190	4190	she	84	“You ca n’t redesign the Van Heusen Hotel . It ’s a landmark . Did you know the hotel was the first to install elevators ? The hotel ’s chef created the snickerdoodle . That building is an integral thread woven into the fabric of this city . ”She
4257	4278	4279	4279	he	380	“Born and raised in Chicago , Ms. Van Heusen . You ’re not telling me anything I do n’t know , ”
4285	4296	4297	4297	she	84	“Then you know remodeling the Van Heusen makes no sense , ”
4307	4329	4297	4297	she	84	“ Our hotel is known for its style . Guests come there to experience a living , breathing piece of Chicago . ”
4353	4360	4361	4361	he	380	“My hotel , Ms. Van Heusen , ”
4443	4472	4473	4473	she	84	“No matter who owns the building , you have to know that robbing the Van Heusen of its style will make it just another whitewashed , dull hotel , ”
4561	4568	4576	4576	he	380	“ Surely there ’s another way . ”He
4580	4593	4576	4576	he	380	“ Your parents have been in the red for nearly two years . ”She
4601	4609	4610	4610	he	380	years?“I gather this is news to you , ”
4616	4628	4610	4610	he	380	“ Your father ’s hospital bills put them further in debt . ”He
4663	4675	4676	4676	Reese	101	her?“They came to us to buy the building and we did , ”
4679	4705	4676	4676	Reese	101	“ I could have fired them , but I did n’t . I offered a generous pension plan if they stayed on through the remodel . ”A
4717	4727	4676	4676	Reese	101	Pension?“I take it you did n’t know that either . ”“They
4735	4801	4676	4676	Reese	101	” she said flatly , but it did n’t take the sting from the truth . They ’d kept everything from her . Her pie - in - the - sky parents who loved that building arguably as much as they loved each other had to have gone to Big Crane as a last resort . They ’d overlooked he had Satan for a son . “They
4811	4820	4803	4804	your father	2345	” she said , her anger blooming anew . “
4830	4847	4848	4848	Satan	105	”“My father likes your parents , but this is n’t about what nice people they are , ”
4851	4869	4848	4848	Satan	105	“ He mentioned how well they ’d maintained the local landmark with what funds they had available . ”Merina
4915	4922	4923	4923	she	84	“Your father is a wise man , ”
4948	4972	4923	4923	she	84	“ I doubt his intention when he purchased the Van Heusen was to turn it into a mini - me of the Crane . ”“My
4997	5012	4981	4981	He	348	” Reese shrugged , which made him look relaxed and made her pulse skyrocket . “
5038	5049	5050	5050	you	101	”Funky ? Just who did this jerk - off think he was?“Do
5062	5066	5067	5067	Hemingway	106	” she blurted . “
5080	5089	5067	5067	Hemingway	106	lobby!”“I thought he mostly wrote in Key West . ”“Rumors
5091	5134	5067	5067	Hemingway	106	” she hissed . A smirk slid over his lips in a look that likely melted his fan club ’s collective underpants , but it had no effect on her . Not now that she knew how far he was taking this . “You
5141	5145	5067	5067	Hemingway	106	” he said , “
5181	5240	5252	5252	He	404	”At the cool pronouncement of her name , she sat straighter . She ’d been told last month that the building inspector had come by for a reassessment for property value , not that he ’d be feeding information to the vulture sitting across from her now . She’d clearly been left out of a lot of discussions . “The
5248	5251	5252	5252	He	404	”“It shows . ”
5258	5299	5252	5252	He	404	“ The Van Heusen is stodgy and outdated , and revenue is falling more each quarter . I ’m doing your parents a favor by offering them a way out of what will be nothing but a future of headaches . ”
5343	5386	5387	5387	He	404	“ The Crane branding is strong , our business plan seamless . If you love the building as much as you claim to , you ’d support the efforts to increase the traffic . We ’ll see profits double with an upgrade . ”
5392	5406	5389	5389	his	404	“ But not with your parents there . And not with you there . ”A
5432	5436	5429	5429	he	404	“You’re … firing … me?”He
5441	5453	5429	5429	he	404	“My family ’s goddamn name is on the marquee , Crane ! ”
5488	5498	5499	5499	he	404	“Your family ’s name will remain on the building , ”
5528	5553	5525	5525	he	404	“ Your parents are getting close to retirement age . Are you sure you swam over here on their behalf ? Or is this about you?”“Of
5559	5633	5525	5525	he	404	” she said too quickly . She was n’t sure at all . Her world had been upended . Like when she ’d learned there was no Santa Claus and that her dad had been sneaking downstairs to eat the Oreos all those years . She thought back to her mom telling her about the sale of the Van Heusen and recalled the dash of hope in Jolie ’s expression . Did they want out?“Think
5663	5667	5652	5652	I	0	” Reese stated . “
5678	5800	5801	5803	Ms. Van Heusen	104	”If she had said that , the sentence would have been infused with passion hinting at the fairy tale by which they came to own the Van Heusen . When Reese said it , he made the hotel sound like it was a lame , deaf , blind dog needing to be put down . No . She would not accept this . Not from Reese . Not from her parents . It was possible they ’d forgotten how much the hotel meant to them . Not having money created desperate feelings . Her father was n’t as spry as he once was given his heart condition . Maybe they needed her intrusion . Reese ’s phone buzzed and Bobbie stated , “
5812	5818	5819	5819	Merina	84	”“I do n’t want it , ”
5846	5849	5831	5831	his	376	“ Very well ”
5919	5937	5938	5938	Reese	101	“I have an appointment I ca n’t miss , but I wo n’t leave you in suspense . ”
5989	5991	5992	5992	she	84	“Suspense ? ”
6025	6039	6016	6016	he	376	“I’m not going to put you out on your fantastic ass , Merina . ”
6179	6191	6160	6160	he	376	“I appreciate your reconsidering . I belong at the Van Heusen . ”
6223	6236	6237	6237	he	376	“No , you misunderstand me . I ca n’t keep you there , ”
6248	6292	6237	6237	he	376	“ But I can offer you almost any position you ’d like at Crane Hotels . We have openings in Wisconsin , Virginia , and Ohio . I know it ’s not Chicago , but chances are you can stay in the Midwest . ”He
6447	6457	6464	6464	she	84	“You listen to me , you suited sewer rat . ”
6470	6508	6513	6513	his	420	“ I ’m going to find a way around your machinations and when I do , I ’m going to march back in here with the contract my parents signed and shove it straight up your ass . ”Reese
6544	6566	6525	6525	he	420	“ You ’ll have to forgive Ms. Van Heusen . She does n’t like when she does n’t get her way . ”The
6585	6590	6578	6578	Reese	101	“ Will there be anything else?”“Your
6596	6679	6580	6580	his	420	” With that parting blow , she left , holding fast to the suit jacket . She wore it on the ride down the elevator , through the bland lobby , and out onto Superior Street , where she wadded it up and threw it into a mud puddle gathering near the curb . She walked back to the Van Heusen in the rain , telling herself she ’d won this round . But Merina did n’t feel victorious . She felt lost .
6727	6735	6736	6736	Reese	101	“That meeting went as well as expected , ”
6739	6746	6736	6736	Reese	101	“ Bunch of stodgy old placeholders . ”“At
6755	6876	6748	6748	you	101	” his father said . Reese had nearly bitten his tongue to remain silent during the meeting . Now he felt his lip curl as he watched the horde of suits waddle away . He had one seat on the board . His father another . But they were in the minority . Thanks to his great - grandfather , who started Crane Hotels and lost the controlling percentage to the public . The board had made it clear last month they would not appoint Reese in the position of CEO of Crane Hotels when Alex retired . Apparently , no one had changed their collective minds . They ’d always liked Alex but had never warmed to his sons . “Disloyal
6881	6965	6736	6736	Reese	101	” Reese said . They saw him as a spoon - fed brat who ’d inherited his way to the top floor of Crane Hotels , which was an oversimplified truth . Yes , he was sitting at the position of chief operations officer because his father had founded Crane Hotels , but it was n’t as if he did n’t work . As COO , Reese was in charge of the daily operations of the company , which was no small task . “You
6973	6983	6984	6984	They	433	” Alex stated , not for the first time . “
6989	6998	6999	6999	Reese	101	”“I work damn near eighty hours a week , ”
7004	7011	6999	6999	Reese	101	“ I bleed over fiscal reports . ”“You
7019	7110	6999	6999	Reese	101	” Tag advised , wearing an easy smile . His facial hair was so heavy , he may as well have been sporting a beard . Reese ’s youngest brother ran Guest and Restaurant Services for Crane Hotels . He did a lot of travel for hotel openings and bar and restaurant events . Typically , you could n’t get him into a suit . Today , he ’d eschewed his usual corporate Indiana Jones look for gray slacks and a white button - down . All hail the board . “They
7118	7245	6999	6999	Reese	101	” Alex said , tipping his head at his other son . At that , Tag sat straight in his chair and plucked the pencil out of his low - hanging ponytail - bun hybrid . Tag bucked the system every chance he had , so it was n’t any wonder the board had n’t appreciated his bravado . He worked hard , but his style was more beach bum than corporate and every one of those old crones knew it . The mess over who would hold the position of CEO was only between Reese and the board . Tag did n’t want it . Alex was retiring . Their other brother , Eli , was still stationed in the desert and was n’t interested . “I
7250	7339	6999	6999	Reese	101	” Reese announced . Something that had been knocking around in his head since a soaking wet Merina Van Heusen had marched into his office and plunked a doorknob onto his desk . At the mention of an idea , Alex waited . Tag ’s brow creased . Tag should know better . Of course Reese would come up with a plan before he gave up on being named CEO . It may be an impromptu , mostly old - fashioned plan , but it was a plan . “Merina
7361	7367	7340	7341	Van Heusen	84	”Alex ’s brow went up . “She
7371	7375	6999	6999	Reese	101	” Reese continued . “
7395	7407	7408	7408	Tag	109	”“You’re remodeling the Van Heusen ? That place is a landmark , ”
7411	7419	7408	7408	Tag	109	“All aboard the ball - busting train . ”
7433	7439	7427	7428	His brother	438	“ Well , it is . ”“Shit
7441	7498	7420	7420	Reese	101	” Alex said with a raspy chuckle . His father was in a sleek gray suit and whimsical checkered tie and wore a full white mustache / goatee combo that complemented his thick white hair . He was former military , brawny , had brains and power , and enough balls to say what he meant . “Shit

7951	7965	7919	7919	Reese	101	” Tag smirked . Smart - ass . Reese ignored him and continued . “
8005	8132	8133	8133	Merina	112	” That was n’t how he operated , but there was no convincing the outside world . The women he dated knew the score , enjoyed their time spent , and moved on . But reporters were vampires . They wanted blood and amicability did n’t make for interesting headlines . It was the run - in with Merina that started Reese ’s gears turning . She was fiery and passionate but also elegant and intelligent . If he were involved with someone like her , the local rags would have no choice but to take notice . One relationship for show could fix all of his problems . It was almost too simple . He told his brother and father as much , finishing with , “
8139	8374	8133	8133	Merina	112	”She’d fit into Reese ’s world — into his plan — seamlessly . At the mention of package , he pictured her again . She ’d been a study in opposites : stylish in understated matching jewelry , high - end name - brand shoes and clothing , yet she ’d been borderline unhinged . Soaked to the bone and in complete disarray . Her honeyed blond hair had begun to dry — the ends curling against her shoulders , while her silk shirt was plastered to her body , her breasts in particular , nipples erect and staring him in the face . But her fantastic tits did n’t have his undivided attention . Through her shirt , he ’d been able to see the outline and a dab of color on what appeared to be a tattoo . A tattoo . It’d taken Herculean willpower to return his gaze to her strongly arched brows and frowning full lips . And even more willpower to keep his mind from wondering what bit of ink she ’d permanently etched onto her skin . A butterfly ? A teddy bear ? A pair of hearts ? Merina was a beautiful woman . Seeing her disheveled and learning that under her prim - and - proper exterior there lived a wild woman was … fascinating . It’d been a long time since anyone had fascinated him . “You
8378	8388	8133	8133	Merina	112	” One of Tag ’s eyebrows climbed his forehead . “
8392	8397	8398	8398	Reese	101	Heusen?”“That ’s the gist . ”
8401	8413	8398	8398	Reese	101	“How ? She has to hate you for trying to disassemble the VH.”“A
8417	8448	8398	8398	Reese	101	”Tag laughed so hard , he nearly toppled off his chair . By the time he righted himself , he was swiping moisture from his eyes and shaking his head . “
8456	8477	8398	8398	Reese	101	”Reese felt his mouth tug at the corners . He saw no other way . This would have to work . “Merina
8484	8521	8522	8522	She	454	” Alex interjected , and Reese breathed a sigh of relief . His father , his hero . If Alex saw this working , it would . They shared a brain for business , for negotiating . “
8544	8547	8548	8548	Reese	101	”“No kidding . ”
8587	8593	8594	8594	Reese	101	Plus—“She used the term horseshit , ”

9799	9803	9750	9750	he	488	” Tag said . “I
9807	9842	9750	9750	he	488	” Reese said , meaning it . The Crane men had always stuck together . His youngest brother may ride his ass on occasion , but in the clutch , Tag had his back . “But
9844	9852	9750	9750	he	488	” Tag continued , his tone cautious , “
9859	9963	9750	9750	he	488	” He finally stood , slowly , then crossed his arms over his chest . Tag was taller than Reese or Eli , standing close to six - five . Massive shoulders , huge arms , and tree - trunk legs came from their father ’s side , the towering height from their mother ’s father . Granddad Weller was huge . Eli and Reese liked to give Tag a hard time about his hair , but Tag refused to cut it . Either he had a Samson complex or he liked looking like a beached merman , it was hard to say . “It
9973	10032	10033	10033	I	0	”Tag swept the legal pad off the desk , not a word written on it . Reese had no idea why he brought a pad to meetings except that maybe he thought it made him look like he fit here and not on a biplane in a jungle . Tag scrubbed a hand over his heavy facial hair . “
10041	10090	10150	10150	Heather	123	You?”Reese shook his head . He ’d eat at his desk like he did every day . Did n’t keep Tag from asking . Which he appreciated . As brothers who were musketeers at heart , none of them would ever let the other one remain in solitude . “I
10099	10108	10150	10150	Heather	123	” Reese said as he opened the door . “Guess
10111	10128	10129	10129	You	499	” Tag said , walking out ahead of him ; then he threw over his shoulder , “
10146	10146	10129	10129	You	499	”
10152	10343	10150	10150	Heather	123	” Merina said to the Van Heusen ’s new bartender - slash - waitress as she headed out the door . Flame , the restaurant in the Van Heusen , had n’t been terribly busy tonight , but Heather had handled the bar by herself , and given that she ’d only been working for the VH for two weeks , Merina was suitably impressed . Nearly a week had passed since she ’d barged into Reese Crane ’s office , and neither she nor her parents , as far as she knew , had heard from him again . After she ’d left the hotel ’s doorknob on Reese ’s desk , Merina had stomped back into the VH , snatched a few towels off a passing cart , and gone into her office . After snagging a sweater off a hook on the wall and putting it on , she went to her mother ’s office , only to find her father in there , too , leaning over the computer . Merina had n’t given them a chance to acknowledge her before she started in on them . “How
10353	10375	10376	10376	Honey	125	” she ’d asked while wringing her hair in the towel . Her father had straightened and held up a hand . “
10382	10427	10451	10451	her	0	”“I ca n’t take a breath . I ca n’t even think ! You sold the hotel without telling me ? How much financial strain were you under ? Did you consider asking me for help ? How could you go outside the family with this?”When
10558	10566	10567	10567	Mark	126	“Big Crane was willing to buy it , ”
10579	10609	10567	10567	Mark	126	“ As it stood , we would have had to put thousands into it just to sell . And your mother and I would likely be out of jobs . ”“But
10618	10624	10567	10567	Mark	126	” Merina huffed her frustration . “
10628	10654	10657	10657	him	2380	I.”Her parents had n’t known that part , which made her feel moderately better — at least they had n’t kept that from her too . “I
10659	10664	10657	10657	him	2380	” Merina had confessed . “
10672	10734	10665	10665	He	2380	” She did n’t know if that was true , but she intended to speak with him further about it . Next time with a dry shirt . That day she ’d wanted so badly for her parents to share in her outrage . Instead her mother had encouraged her in her typical glass - half - full way by saying , “
10762	11034	11036	11036	creeper	515	”Which made her suspect they were resigned to their plight . Merina paced through the barren restaurant now , her mind latched onto the past . Reese had made it clear to her he was n’t keeping any of them . Not her parents , not Merina , and she guessed the rest of the building ’s loyal staff would be in danger of losing their jobs too . She was n’t foolish enough to believe he ’d forgotten about their discussion , but there were no further e - mails or appointments , and the locksmith had replaced the card reader on the hotel room door , only now there was a mismatched doorknob instead of the one she ’d gifted to Crane . No construction workers in hard hats had shown up to destroy the building during that week , so for that , she was grateful . The more Reese Crane dragged his heels , the more time she had to come up with a solution to save her job and the hotel from being turned into a glass shrine . She flipped the sign around at the threshold of Flame so that it read CLOSED as her cell phone chimed . A text at one a.m. ? Had to be Lorelei . Maybe back from a horrific date and ready to share all the gory details . Lore knew Merina did n’t go to sleep until three , sometimes four . But a glance at the screen showed that it was n’t her best friend , but an unknown number . Call me if you ’re awake . “Sorry
11038	11047	11036	11036	creeper	515	” she said as she pocketed her phone . “
11055	11278	11282	11284	Ms. Van Heusen	104	” Before she stepped into the lobby , though , her phone chimed again . She dug it out of her pocket . Reese Crane . Her heart lifted to her throat . Reese Crane was texting her ? He ’d ignored her for the last week while she tried not to fret over whether he ’d roll a wrecking ball down Rush Street for a surprise hotel smashing , and now he was texting her ? She stared at the seven words on her screen as if she might consider responding . Which of course she wouldn’t . What if he ’d changed his mind about the Van Heusen ? About keeping Merina on as manager?Don’t be ridiculous . That ’s not what he wanted . The man was an arrogant , pompous jerk who did n’t have any reason to contact her unless he wanted to twist the knife . He could call her during normal business hours . But even as the thought occurred , she did n’t put her phone away . Only bit her lip and continued staring . If something was about to go down with the hotel , or with her job , or if there was a way to prevent things from going south , then she needed to know as soon as possible . “Everything
11286	11373	11282	11284	Ms. Van Heusen	104	” Arnold asked from the front desk . He ’d worked here since she was a little girl . And because she loved the nighttime , and so did he , she had often sneaked down to sit with him while her parents worked instead of stay in bed . In the end , that memory was what changed her mind . If there was a chance to save their jobs , she owed Arnold and her parents the discomfort of returning Satan Crane ’s call . “Everything
11393	11400	11401	11401	He	89	something?”“I’m good , but thank you . ”
11415	11418	11401	11401	He	89	“You’re welcome . ”
11437	11442	11443	11443	Reese	101	“Just as I suspected , ”
11454	11459	11460	11460	she	516	“Hello to you too , ”
11466	11472	11463	11464	Arrogant prick	518	“ What is just as you suspected?”“That
11478	11486	11473	11473	you	89	”“I sleep , but it ’s early . ”“It
11489	11518	11446	11446	his	89	”There was a gap of silence that stretched , and she let it . He was the one who wanted to talk to her . Let him talk . “I
11535	11548	11526	11526	I	0	”Behind the bar , she rested a clean mug on the surface . “
11558	11560	11553	11553	I	0	or—”“Now . ”“Now?”“You’re
11568	11570	11571	11571	you	89	”“Yes , but—”“See
11576	11659	11571	11571	you	89	”Silence . She looked at the screen of her phone . Call ended . She frowned , not liking that he did n’t explain . Not liking how she felt as if she did n’t have a choice in the matter . Not liking any of it . Not liking him . She was a big girl . She could take her medicine . Even if her medicine was a prescription written on a pink slip that she ’d be out on her “
11662	11854	11860	11860	Crane	101	” by the end of this week . But she really hoped not . She pulled the lever on a vat of hot water on the industrial coffeemaker , then dunked a tea bag into her mug and decided to run to the bathroom while it steeped . A quick check confirmed she was as put together as one could expect at this time of night . Sure her hair had gone a little limp and her skirt and shirt were wrinkled from wear , but her makeup was reasonably intact and she ’d brushed her teeth after a late dinner . Not that she was trying to impress Reese Crane . By the time five minutes was up , she was tossing the tea bag in the trash , and the revolving hotel door was spinning . Reese stepped in , wearing a dark suit and pale butter - yellow tie . In his pocket was a matching kerchief , and shiny black shoes poked out of sharp pants accentuating thick thighs and , yeah , she ’d admit it , a nice ass . He ’d made good time . “Welcome
11862	11872	11860	11860	Crane	101	” Merina called from the doorway of the bar . “
11882	11903	11877	11877	your	101	”He turned to face her , his expression registering surprise that faded quickly into his usual take - charge façade . “
11907	12011	11860	11860	Crane	101	”His steps were sure and strong , his body moving like it ’d been crafted to walk toward a woman . Merina expected Reese to look at home only in his whitewashed hotel with no personality . But he also looked like he belonged in the warmth of the Van Heusen , with its deep , rich woods and tapestry - style chairs . The soft lighting warmed his skin and made the flecks of gold stand out in his facial hair . He was alarmingly attractive tonight , and she decided to blame that observation on her always - present sleep deprivation . “How
12022	12031	11860	11860	Crane	101	” she asked as he followed her in . “You
12043	12047	11860	11860	Crane	101	scotch?”“We have both . ”“I’ll
12052	12063	11860	11860	Crane	101	” With a nod , he moved to the bar . “Sorry
12069	12146	11860	11860	Crane	101	” She would n’t allow him to come in here and boss her around . He was on her turf . For now , anyway . Glancing at her mug , he looked as if he was weighing his options of whether to argue about the bar being closed or not . He must have decided against it . He said nothing more . Nothing . Even though he ’d called this after - hours meeting . “Would
12152	12170	11860	11860	Crane	101	” May as well start the ball rolling . His expression turned slightly amused before he nodded . “
12173	12254	11860	11860	Crane	101	”She led him away from the bar — no way was she propping up on one of those hard wooden seats after the day she ’d had — and slid into a booth . He sat across from her , and with half the lights off in the lounge , the seating arrangement felt intimate . He regarded the bar , his mouth twisting in indecision . Like he was debating on what part of it to tear out first . “Okay
12256	12284	11860	11860	Crane	101	” Merina interrupted to take his mind off destroying her second favorite room in the hotel . She wrapped her hands around her mug of steaming tea . “

In her opinion , he saw way too many whomevers . A string of silly women who were likely chasing after his wallet . “

13259	13361	13255	13255	you	535	” His voice dipped , slicing her hectic thoughts into more pieces . The energy between them intensified . There was a charge there . A spark in the air when he was this close to her . She thought it ’d been a by - product of her rage when she ’d huffed into his office last week . But no . It was real . Which made his proposition a million times more volatile . Because she did not like him — not even a little — yet that had n’t quelled the physical attraction , which was problematic . “I
13367	13374	13255	13255	you	535	” she reminded both of them . “If
13378	13385	13255	13255	you	535	” he continued , ignoring her , “
13404	13576	13386	13386	you	535	”Her jaw softened , her mouth falling open . She was n’t seeing anyone , but what if she was ? He expected her to make a phone call in the wee hours to announce they were through ? She would have been offended for her boyfriend if there were one . She thought of the man who delivered fresh , organic produce to the hotel . Miles . He ’d asked her out for coffee a few days ago . He was cute in a pair of black - framed glasses and his hipster - wear . She guessed him to be a few years younger than her twenty - nine and probably the only thing they had in common was that they both drank coffee , but he had a nice smile and she ’d been flattered . So she ’d said yes . If she agreed to do what Crane was asking … well , there was no way she could explore anything with Miles . With anyone . “Merina
13578	13580	13581	13581	Her	539	”“What ? ”
13586	13593	13594	13594	he	540	“Are you dating anyone right now ? ”
13615	13616	13599	13599	She	539	“Are you?”He
13620	13628	13599	13599	She	539	“ you ’ve got to be kidding me ”
13631	13671	13672	13672	her	539	“Oh , right . Like a million somebodies . Tell me why you ’re allergic to seeing a woman more than once . Is it because they find out how lousy you are in bed and then run for the hills?”At
13681	13701	13709	13709	he	540	“ It ’s because I never call them again and instruct my secretary to send flowers stating as much . ”Her
13768	13778	13779	13779	she	539	“What about the woman I saw leaving your office ? ”
13787	13797	13779	13779	she	539	“ She did n’t look like a typical businesswoman . ”
13812	13827	13779	13779	she	539	“She left her necklace on the hotel nightstand and came to pick it up . ”“Surely
13839	13846	13828	13829	the Crane	101	” she said with a snort . “My
13849	13871	13876	13877	my team	542	” he clarified . Oh . She felt her face go red . Of course he ’d slept with that woman . “Everything
13888	13898	13779	13779	she	539	” he said , moving them forward yet again . “I
13905	13928	13779	13779	she	539	” she murmured . She had to murmur , because her lips were numb . And her fingers . All of her . “
13930	13935	13936	13936	Reese	101	weeks?”“The sooner the better . ”
13941	14045	13936	13936	Reese	101	“ It will be a simple affair at my house . My brother and father will be there , a justice of the peace , and a few members of the Crane Holdings board . Keep your invitations essential . Your parents , a best friend , a few close family members . We need to keep this small . You ca n’t tell your family you ’re marrying for show . There is too big of a chance the truth will come out . I ’ll have a photographer there who will feed a few pictures to the media for publicity purposes . ”Publicity
14221	14239	14240	14240	he	105	“It has to appear real , so I ’ve handed the details over to my PR specialist , ”
14243	14284	14240	14240	he	105	“ I ’ve spoken with her about it already . A few public appearances and you ’ll move into my Lake Shore Drive mansion . She assures me she can easily spin this as a whirlwind romance to the press . ”Her
14301	14310	14289	14289	He	105	“ I know . Whirlwind romance . Ridiculous . ”
14383	14439	14446	14446	his	105	“Call whomever you ’re dating and let him down easy . We do n’t need him using your breakup as media fodder . Since the timeline is tight , I ’ll need to know your answer by the end of the week . Six months , Merina , and you ’ll get everything you want . ”He
14493	14505	14506	14506	he	105	“If you and whoever you ’re seeing are meant to be , ”
14516	14534	14513	14513	his	105	“ I ’m sure he ’ll take you back when you and I do n’t work out . ”“I’m
14539	14595	14506	14506	he	105	” Unable to sit any longer , she rose from the table , her hands flattening on the surface . His eyes went to her shirt like they did the day she stomped into his hotel . He really had a boob fetish , did n’t he?Slowly , he raised his eyes to her face . “
14603	14640	14642	14642	I	0	”Easier . Sure . Just allow herself to be bought off by the misogynistic billionaire who was trying to control every particle of her life for six months . Just marry him . Easy - peasy . “I
14650	14707	14799	14799	his	556	” That was the most honest thing she ’d said since he arrived . She could n’t categorize what he was asking . She could n’t fathom it . She could n’t picture it . Her dating Reese was outrageous . Her living with him ? Insane . But marriage … God . He was crazy . “I
14710	14721	14722	14722	You	0	” Unaffected by her reaction , Reese stood with her . “
14741	14757	14799	14799	his	556	” With a curt nod , he turned and started out of the dining room . “I
14762	14769	14799	14799	his	556	” she could n’t help asking . “Yes
14771	14791	14799	14799	his	556	” He plunged his hands into his pockets and waited for her to say more . So she did . “You
14794	14796	14797	14797	He	556	already?”“Yes . ”
14880	14886	14887	14887	she	0	“And if I say no , ”
14896	14902	14887	14887	she	0	“ do you have a plan B?”This
14919	14961	14967	14967	his	556	“ Believe it or not , my list of potential brides with real estate I can hold over their heads is relatively short . I ’ve thought this through . It ’s the best course of action for both of us . ”He
15045	15064	15263	15263	Malcolm	134	” Lorelei ’s deep brown eyes crinkled around the edges and she threw her head back and laughed . “I
15083	15176	15263	15263	Malcolm	134	” Merina yawned , then drank the coffee she needed more than her next breath . It ’d been a sleepless , stressful couple of nights . On a good night , she slept a few hours . This week she was lucky if she ’d accumulated a few hours ’ sleep since Monday . Lorelei swiped moisture from her inky lashes — and not inky because they were coated in mascara . Inky because they were naturally coal black , like her smoothed - to - perfection shoulder - length hair . “You
15180	15237	15263	15263	Malcolm	134	” Merina blurted . Because her best friend did , in fact , look amazing . Her cocoa skin was glowing , her cheeks highlighted with a dab of bronzer , her eyes bright and sparkling . Merina , on the other hand , looked like a hobo brought in to be given a hot meal . “
15242	15252	15263	15263	Malcolm	134	” she said , her lazy synapses finally firing . “
15265	15274	15275	15275	Lorelei	127	togeth—”“What ? No ! Neither of those things . ”
15290	15309	15277	15277	her	127	“ And we ’re not talking about me . We ’re talking about you , future Mrs. Crane . ”Since
15411	15415	15416	15416	Merina	84	“Romantic , right ? ”
15561	15563	15564	15564	Merina	84	“So ? ”
15567	15576	15564	15564	Merina	84	“ How badly am I getting screwed here ? ”
15610	15612	15613	15613	Lorelei	127	“Honestly ? ”
15629	15642	15620	15620	her	127	“ I think you ’re sitting pretty if you take the deal . ”Knife
15663	15680	15694	15694	her	84	“ I ’m sorry , I swore I thought I heard you imply this is a good idea?”Lorelei
15705	15722	15694	15694	her	84	“ Beautiful as your parents ’ house is , I know you ’re ready to leave . ”Merina
15953	15961	15962	15962	Merina	84	“I can move out without Reese Crane , ”
15971	15975	15962	15962	Merina	84	“This is true . ”
15988	16036	16038	16038	her	84	“ But if you with this ring , I thee we d , you can move out sooner , keep the Van Heusen , and you ’ll be in charge of everyone ’s jobs , including your own . This arrangement takes care of all your problems . Plus”—she
16049	16063	16038	16038	her	84	her—“this would be a great test run for getting back on the horse . ”Merina
16072	16082	16038	16038	her	84	“ I think I ’m about to be offended . ”“I’m
16087	16100	16101	16101	I	0	” Lore stated , resting a comforting palm over Merina ’s hand . “
16118	16469	16116	16116	Corbin	137	”Corbin . At the mention of her ex - boyfriend , Merina closed her eyes . Lorelei ’s reassuring touch was n’t reassuring at all . Corbin marked the one time in Merina ’s life she wished she could rewind , erase , then fast - forward back to today . She’d met him at a mixer at the Van Heusen ’s former assistant manager ’s house . She went to Liza ’s because she was invited and she wanted to be friendly . She had no idea it was a setup until Liza shoved her brother , Corbin , in Merina ’s face and left them suspiciously alone on the back porch . To her surprise , she liked him . A lot . He was fun and carefree … seemed less high - strung than the business sorts she ’d dated in the past . Not that the list was long . It was mainly comprised of a few longish - term boyfriends during her college years , and then Corbin . Six years of semi - serious dating that had not resulted in marriage or even living together and had tied up what she now recalled fondly as her best dating years . The evening at Liza ’s led to exchanged phone numbers and from there turned into a few fun dates at Liza ’s apartment where Corbin lived as her couch - crashing roommate . The third date ended in Merina ’s bedroom , and she was grateful she had parents who were modern enough not to pry when she had a man over . The beginning of the end came when Liza announced she was moving to Colorado to care for hers and Corbin ’s aging mother . Corbin asked to stay with Merina for the short - term and she hesitantly said yes . When a few weeks turned into a few months , Merina started paying extra on her rent and saying it was from Corbin . It was n’t . He was unemployed , and she quickly learned that his lifestyle was so “
16471	16510	16640	16640	babe	592	” because he essentially mooched off whomever was handy . Six months later , she came home from work one night to find her parents on the sofa and a note on her bed from Corbin that read , “
16515	16582	16513	16513	babe	592	” She learned the next morning her bank accounts had been drained . In the quiet of the wee hours , sometimes she regretted not pressing charges , but she ’d been too embarrassed to tell anyone else the truth : that Liza had effectively unloaded her loser brother onto Merina and bolted . Merina opened her eyes and met Lorelei ’s sweet , concerned gaze . “
16615	16627	16607	16613	a man who needs something from me	593	”Lorelei patted Merina ’s arm , then pulled her hand away . “
16642	16645	16646	16646	She	128	”“Good point . ”
16656	16670	16646	16646	She	128	“I mean , come on . The last date you went on was with who?”Her
16687	16692	16682	16682	Lore	128	“Big teeth martini guy . ”Merina
16700	16706	16646	16646	She	128	“ He did n’t have big teeth!”“They
16724	16726	16727	16727	Merina	84	”“Yech . ”
16785	16796	16761	16761	She	84	“ Well , getting on that horse was n’t beneficial . ”“Should
16801	16806	16761	16761	She	84	” Lorelei said thoughtfully . “
16814	16851	16761	16761	She	84	”Merina laughed so hard she had to hold her stomach . Lorelei joined her . Once they sobered , Merina sniffed and sighed and admitted the part about Crane ’s offer that was eating at her . “It
16866	16925	16761	16761	She	84	”Not that she ’d always dreamed of a poufy gown with bridesmaids and groomsmen flanking her on either side . She had been fairly certain marriage would come as a natural part of a long - lasting relationship . The right long - lasting relationship . Certainly not part of a business agreement . She wrinkled her nose . “That
16929	16933	16761	16761	She	84	” Lorelei admitted . “Marriage
16957	16966	16968	16968	you	599	” she said of her parents ’ engagement . “I
16982	16985	16970	16971	My dad	600	”Merina smiled . “
16994	17016	16987	16988	your mom	602	” She ’d heard the story from Lore ’s parents before . It was always a boisterous story filled with laughter . “

17069	17075	17076	17076	she	127	“ Vegas and Malcolm McDowell , ”
17084	17105	17076	17076	she	127	“ Life is a series of events . We ’re never sure which opportunities are going to come our way . ”“I’ve
17118	17136	17137	17137	She	127	right?”“Six short months . Malcolm and I lasted six years . Try explaining that breakup to everyone . ”
17163	17190	17137	17137	She	127	“ I have to meet a client at Starbucks . Another coffee for me . Hopefully I can maintain rather than behave like a hyperactive squirrel . ”“Your
17201	17207	17196	17196	I	0	” Merina ’s smile faded . “
17219	17221	17222	17222	Lorelei	127	”“Fine . ”
17229	17245	17246	17246	She	127	“ You owe me a dirty martini with extra blue - cheese - stuffed olives . ”
17260	17280	17281	17281	She	127	“ Take the deal , Mer . He ’s being fair and there is nothing in there about consummation . ”
17287	17295	17281	17281	She	127	“ Unless you want there to be . ”At
17309	17318	17305	17305	her	84	“ I would n’t sleep with that jerk . ”“Well

17837	17890	17829	17829	Bobbie	173	” he said , dropping the phone on his desk and meeting her eyes . She ’d come in here to review his schedule for next week and probably thought he was ignoring her . But he ’d heard every word . And now Merina ’s message had changed a few things . “
17921	17933	17917	17918	Penelope Brand	145	”Bobbie ’s eyebrows shot up , but she did n’t argue . “

19424	19464	19416	19416	She	84	”At the word wife , Reese ’s breathing went shallow . Of course , marriage and wife went together , but phrased that way , he was reminded of another long - term relationship that had n’t panned out . “It
19470	19508	19416	19416	She	84	” he reminded them both before he puked . He had this . He did n’t have to fall in love with Merina ; he just had to show up at a few public appearances with her . “Armande

19522	19551	19598	19598	I	0	” Reese ’s neck prickled . Armande was an upscale fusion French / Italian restaurant known for its romantic mood and special menu made up entirely of aphrodisiacs . “That
19561	19567	19568	19568	Reese	101	”“Armande is n’t exactly subtle , ”
19579	19585	19586	19586	Tag	109	“Neither is Reese ’s Rocket , ”

19629	19635	19636	19636	he	438	“ Trust me , man , ”

19819	19838	19812	19812	Bobbie	173	” came the curt voice . She did n’t wait for Merina to respond before she plowed forward . “
19855	19864	19812	19812	Bobbie	173	”To sign the prenuptial contract , no doubt . “Of
19867	19903	19812	19812	Bobbie	173	” Merina answered with fake bravado . She heard the sound of a pen scratching on a notepad . The sooner she signed those papers , the sooner she could move on to Phase 2 of “
19908	19936	19973	19973	She	84	”“Also , he has scheduled a dinner with you at nine p.m. this evening at Armande . He ’ll send a car to your residence at eight . ”Merina
20021	20028	20029	20029	Merina	84	“Tonight ’s no good for me , ”
20062	20083	20087	20089	normal human beings	659	“ Perhaps if Mr. Crane could call himself , we could find a time that worked for both of us . ”You

20126	20140	20147	20148	a stylist	660	but—”“The car will be at your house by eight p.m. Do you require a stylist?”“No
20151	20180	20142	20142	I	0	” Merina huffed , insulted on too many levels to count . Bobbie was her least favorite person on the planet , second only to her future husband . “
20186	20193	20147	20148	a stylist	660	”“The restaurant is formal and known for its—”“I
20201	20276	20199	20199	Bobbie	173	” Not because she ’d been there , but because it was lauded in the Trib as the premiere place to see and be seen . Especially for couples . Especially for celebrity couples . Not that Reese Crane was a celebrity , but he was as close as it came to a local one . And now they ’d be seen together in Armande . She could only guess this was part of the “
20279	20318	20147	20148	a stylist	660	” ruse . If that was the case , and this was a suggestion by his public relations person , maybe Merina should n’t be difficult after all . Evidently six months of biting her tongue started now . “Eight
20323	20327	20147	20148	a stylist	660	” she clipped . “Nice
20331	20335	20147	20148	a stylist	660	” Bobbie said . “
20368	20770	20364	20366	Ms. Van Heusen	104	”And she was gone . Merina lowered the phone from her ear in time to see a small envelope icon appear on the screen . An e - mail . That woman was fast . What was she supposed to tell her parents about tonight when a car arrived ? I have a date with billionaire Reese Crane . Yes , turns out he loved when I went over there to challenge him . He finds my trucker mouth irresistible . Sigh . This would be so much easier if she could tell them the truth : that she was marrying to get the Van Heusen Hotel back . That a six - month trade - off would secure her future , and theirs . Granted , the moment her father learned Reese was blackmailing her , he ’d take a ball bat to Reese ’s gonads . So maybe it was better that she had to lie . As much as she hated lying . Deception in general . She thought of Corbin and her lip curled . How’d the saying go ? You ca n’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs . A few white lies told over the next half year , and then she could go back to being herself . It was an act . That ’s all . She’d have to convince her parents , as well as the press , that she and Reese fell in love . Opposites attract ? That was one way to go . Enemies to lovers ? That was another . Still , a ripple of resentment came at how perfect this solution worked out for everyone . Suddenly , she sympathized with her parents ’ hiding their financial worries from her . They loved her and likely did it to protect her , much in the way Merina was doing this because she loved and wanted to protect them . But even with that justification , she was having a hard time forgiving them for hiding this from her for so long . She was an adult ; she could handle bad news . Hell , she had handled financial challenges both on a business and a personal scale . Did n’t they trust her?Well . They would . After the divorce , they could relax knowing the Van Heusen Hotel was back in the family ’s “
20772	20902	20364	20366	Ms. Van Heusen	104	” rather than a square on Crane ’s giant Monopoly board . At her desk , she wiggled her mouse to wake her sleeping computer and dug into her inbox . At the top was the e - mail from Bobbie : a bullet list of items , including the location of the restaurant , make and model of the car coming to pick her up , and a list of places where Merina might procure a manicure , a dress and shoes , and have her hair styled . The personal care items were marked with an asterisk and at the bottom of the list she saw its meaning.*Each of these services will be billed to Crane Hotels at no cost to you . Be still her heart . “I’m
20911	20918	20364	20366	Ms. Van Heusen	104	” she said to the screen . “
20925	20982	20920	20920	I	0	” Decisively , she closed the e - mail and , for good measure , deleted it . She would agree to the dinner and to the car picking her up , but she knew damn well how to get ready for a date at a nice restaurant . Could Reese Crane be more insulting ? More controlling?“Goodness
20988	21012	20920	20920	I	0	you?”Merina looked up to see her mother leaning into the office , her hand resting on the knob of Merina ’s open door . “You
21017	21025	21026	21026	Merina	84	”“Uh … small overcharge on new linens , ”
21036	21046	21026	21026	Merina	84	“ Nothing a quick phone call wo n’t fix . ”“All
21051	21086	21026	21026	Merina	84	” Her mother returned her smile but Merina saw suspicion resting behind it . Lying was n’t something Merina did on a daily basis , so it was understandable she was bad at it . “You’re
21092	21096	21026	21026	Merina	84	” Jolie pushed . “Absolutely
21119	21121	21026	21026	Merina	84	”Chicken . “Later
21126	21154	21026	21026	Merina	84	” her mother asked flatly . Jolie knew her well . Whenever she and Lore went out , they often stayed out until the last possible minute . “No
21156	21165	21026	21026	Merina	84	” Merina closed the window on her computer . “
21171	21188	21190	21190	Mom	662	”“I have to run an errand . Can I pick you up a latte on my way back?”“Sure
21194	21198	21199	21199	Jolie	91	”“Welcome , sweetheart . ”

22208	22212	22243	22248	the woman speaking over his shoulder	702	“Scotch , neat , ”
22266	22273	22261	22261	she	702	“Reese Crane . You never called . ”No
22305	22312	22313	22313	Her	703	“But I did appreciate the flowers . ”
22384	22391	22392	22392	He	154	“Flowers cover a multitude of sins . ”
22415	22420	22421	22421	she	155	“I have to say , ”
22429	22447	22421	22421	she	155	“ when we met , I was hoping what the media says about you was n’t true . ”God
22456	22475	22476	22476	She	155	“I was sure you ’d find the time we spent together good enough to warrant a second date . ”
22514	22520	22476	22476	She	155	“ But I guess not . ”“You
22529	22539	22476	22476	She	155	” he said casually , checking the door again . “
22544	22561	22562	22562	Busted	156	with?”He looked back at her in time to see her wide mouth part into a smile . “
22571	22575	22576	22576	He	89	”“Mayor ’s son . ”
22581	22585	22578	22578	his	89	“ Not bad . ”“Yeah
22587	22598	22605	22605	his	89	but”—she looked around conspiratorially before leaning in and murmuring in his ear—“he
22608	22826	22827	22827	me	0	”That explained the renewed interest . Before he could respond , he caught a flash of honeyed hair and red that drew his eyes to the door . Rebecca had started talking again but her voice faded into the din of diners and waitstaff . Everything in the room fell away as his eyes zoomed in on the woman who ’d come here to meet him . Merina Van Heusen ’s dark blond hair was down , one side pushed behind her ear . She wore a classy , simple red dress . It was n’t skintight but floated seductively over delicate shoulders , flaring at her hips . A subtle V exposed a hint of cleavage , just enough to make his mouth water but not enough to reveal the trace of ink he ’d spotted the day she ’d come in wearing a see - through wet silk shirt . A long gold necklace with a circle pendant hung between her breasts . His mind echoed the reminder business agreement , but his instincts , the ones he trotted out for his dates , recognized her as one hundred percent woman . Beside him , he was aware Rebecca had stopped talking . Just as well — they had nothing to say to each other . “Excuse
22829	22878	22827	22827	me	0	” he said , standing from the bar . The moment he was on his feet , Merina spotted him . Her eyes cut to the brunette , then back to him . He tried to communicate with a subtle headshake . Relax , she ’s old business . “I
22887	22891	22827	22827	me	0	” Rebecca murmured . “I
22894	22898	22827	22827	me	0	” he said . “
22904	23000	22827	22827	me	0	”She lifted her wine in a noncelebratory cheers , a tight , bitter smile on her face . By contrast , Merina Van Heusen was polished . Confident . Decked out in simplicity . She straightened her shoulders as he approached , both hands wrapped around a gold clutch . She wore heels — five inches if he had to guess . The added height put her damn near eye to eye with him . Her amber eyes flashed with a mix of animosity and bravery . Just like the first time he met her . “Merina
23002	23008	22827	22827	me	0	” He offered an elbow . “Reese
23010	23038	23039	23039	Crane	101	” She glided her hand over his forearm . He held back a smile at hearing her say his name . At least she had n’t called him “
23041	23054	23055	23055	he	711	”“I see you charged a dress to my tab as I recommended , ”
23092	23096	23097	23097	She	84	“This old thing ? ”
23148	23154	23112	23112	He	711	“Your table , Mr. Crane . ”
23176	23179	23180	23180	He	711	“Thank you . ”
23199	23201	23202	23202	she	84	“Champagne , ”
23227	23235	23236	23236	Reese	101	“Tag ’s idea , I ’m sure , ”
23239	23240	23236	23236	Reese	101	“Your brother?”“He
23245	23252	23236	23236	Reese	101	”“I thought Bobbie arranged this evening . ”“At
23257	23323	23236	23236	Reese	101	” He did n’t want her to have the wrong idea . He did n’t come here to seduce her . He flicked his gaze from the necklace that drew his eyes to her breasts . Probably best he remembered that . An orderly waiter swept in , poured the champagne , and asked if they ’d like the chef ’s selection for the evening . “
23336	23338	23236	23236	Reese	101	”Jesus . “Yes
23343	23363	23236	23236	Reese	101	” Reese told him , keeping his internal reaction hidden . The waiter vanished in a puff of efficiency . “They
23372	23417	23370	23370	they	716	” Merina cleared her throat , showing the first sign of discomfort when she lifted the champagne flute to her lips . If they were going to make people believe they were in love , they ’d have to be together without a buffer . “One
23435	23447	23424	23425	The staff	718	” He unfolded his napkin and put it on his lap . “
23456	23496	23559	23559	She	724	”Her eyes moved around the room and Reese found he was unwilling to take his eyes off her face . Her makeup was understated , unlike Rebecca ’s dark eyes and bright lipstick , yet Merina was simply stunning . “I
23506	23522	23559	23559	She	724	” she said . He liked the way her lips pursed when she said aphrodisiacs . “Chocolate
23530	23534	23559	23559	She	724	” he answered . “Watermelon
23539	23545	23559	23559	She	724	” Her expression was bemused . “If
23554	23558	23559	23559	She	724	”“You do n’t ? ”
23634	23636	23637	23637	he	723	“No , ”
23640	23644	23637	23637	he	723	“ I don’t . ”“Well
23651	23665	23666	23666	I	0	” she said , sipping from her glass . Then her cheeks colored . “
23677	23748	23671	23671	I	0	”What did she think ? That he ’d brought her here to seduce her and take her back to his room and … best not to chase that thought to its inevitable ending . This romance was for show , not indulgence . The first course came via one of the waitstaff , who set Merina ’s plate in front of her , then Reese ’s in front of him . “
23761	23766	23671	23671	I	0	” the waiter announced . “Wow
23772	23801	23671	23671	I	0	” Merina said , staring down at the single block of mochi and small square of avocado sitting on the center of a gold - edged white plate . “Good
23804	23893	23894	23894	you	726	” He lifted a pair of chopsticks from the table and ate it in one bite . After watching him , she did the same . He sipped his champagne and enjoyed the show . He liked her mouth . Liked her appetite . For business and for food . After she swallowed and dabbed her mouth , he filled her champagne glass , figuring the more of it they drink , the better . This was beyond awkward for two people who did n’t know each other . “Did
23901	23912	23913	23913	you	727	” she asked , licking her lips after another sip . “Not
23916	23931	23913	23913	you	727	” he said , his tone dry . She gave him a flirty smile . “I
23938	23955	23956	23956	you	726	” he muttered , refilling his own glass and placing the bottle in the ice bucket . “Do
23962	23966	23956	23956	you	726	” she asked . “I
23972	23980	23956	23956	you	726	”“Well , at least it ’s flattering . ”“If
23986	23990	23981	23981	you	727	” he challenged . “
24003	24020	23996	23996	someone	2641	” He gestured to her chest . She tilted her head in thought rather than offense . “
24039	24067	24069	24069	You	727	”A smile tickled the side of his mouth . Leave it to Merina to use the word penises as casually as she ’d used the word horseshit . “See
24074	24079	24097	24097	she	727	”“I’m attached to it . ”Her
24160	24166	24167	24167	she	727	“You have a lighter side , ”
24170	24172	24167	24167	she	727	“ Who knew?”“Don’t
24182	24236	24167	24167	she	727	” The air between them was warm and alive . He could continue this for a while longer . But then her eyes went to Rebecca and her date being seated at a small table in the middle of the restaurant and her smile faded . A disapproving grunt sounded from her throat . “That
24239	24248	24167	24167	she	727	” she said , turning back to him . “
24251	24253	24254	24254	His	726	yours?”“No . ”
24263	24265	24273	24273	they	732	“ friends ”
24302	24309	24310	24310	Merina	84	“But you did sleep with her , ”
24313	24321	24322	24322	strangers	736	“I do n’t sleep with my friends . ”“Only
24324	24359	24361	24361	you	84	” She rested her glass on the white tablecloth . That warm attraction between them did n’t fizzle out , but burned hot . She wanted to play hardball ? He could do that . “Who
24365	24368	24361	24361	you	84	Merina?”“Excuse me ? ”
24375	24380	24381	24381	He	726	“You brought it up . ”
24385	24390	24392	24392	her	84	“ Just making conversation . ”She
24402	24418	24395	24395	her	84	“ I should n’t have , I suppose . I find your love life fascinating . ”“You
24430	24469	24470	24470	I	0	” He sat back , feeling the weight of that admission . How had everything he ’d achieved , everything he ’d strived for , been watered down to who he had sex with ? It was insulting . “
24478	24514	24517	24517	his	739	draw?”“Are you kidding ? A wealthy man who dates a parade of beautiful women , yet none of them can penetrate his cold , unfeeling heart ? The public eats that sort of thing up . ”A
24562	24585	24586	24586	she	84	“I was surprised to learn you had such an aversion to the media since you ’ve played into their hands so nicely , ”
24589	24609	24586	24586	she	84	“Just because this city is fascinated with the details of my dates does n’t mean I have to pander . ”
24642	24650	24655	24655	her	84	“They’ll also be fascinated with our lives . ”
24658	24687	24655	24655	her	84	“ We ’re going to be husband and wife . There are things we should talk about . How we met . First date . First time we … ”She
24710	24719	24720	24720	she	84	“ … learned each other ’s middle names , ”
24739	24770	24777	24777	she	84	“Merina , this is our first date . The rest of it we wo n’t have talked about because the public will assume all we ’ve been doing is fucking . ”Her
24809	24839	24803	24804	No one	2393	“I’ve been in the spotlight enough to know that the media assumes I ’m sleeping with the women they photograph me with . They ’re right half the time . ”“Only
24842	24847	24798	24798	he	739	” Merina asked drily . “Seventy
24853	24929	24798	24798	he	739	” he amended with a wry smile . She returned it with one of her own . They ran hot and cold with each other , but no matter the temperature between them , the attraction endured . Fascinating . It’d been a while since he ’d felt anything . Going through the motions was n’t a polite way to describe what he ’d been doing with the women in his past , but accurate . “The
24940	24944	24798	24798	he	739	” he said . “
24973	24982	24967	24967	you	745	”Another laugh . She gestured with her glass . “
24992	24998	24967	24967	you	745	” She lowered her voice . “
25014	25021	25022	25022	He	745	name?”“By then it wo n’t matter . ”
25025	25044	25022	25022	He	745	“ The divorce will garner some attention , but will be buried the next day beneath celebrity hoopla . ”“Or
25054	25096	25045	25052	the next woman you take to an opera	749	” Her words lingered . He let them . He had n’t thought about what he ’d do after Merina , but it made sense that after this hiccup , he ’d continue dating much the same as he did before . “Attention
25107	25116	25098	25100	the Van Heusen	84	” he said instead of addressing her suggestion . “
25148	25158	25159	25159	Her	745	”“You really do hate it , do n’t you ? ”
25204	25210	25211	25211	he	753	“I do n’t hate it , ”
25219	25229	25211	25211	he	753	“ But why choose a homey hotel over a sleek one?”“Seriously
25241	25251	25252	25252	he	753	atmosphere?”“Anyone who is trying to work or get laid , ”
25256	25264	25252	25252	he	753	“I’m not running a brothel , Crane . ”Ah
25270	25273	25266	25266	they	755	“ Crane . ”“Well
25284	25296	25282	25282	Merina	84	” Their gazes locked . He broke the connection by blinking . “
25335	25374	25327	25327	You	758	”Her mouth flinched , taking his comment for what it was — a teasing jab . Their waiter delivered two small cups of watermelon soup with mint leaves and a crumbling of feta on top . Merina scowled . “
25379	25386	25387	25387	he	761	”“It tastes worse than it looks , ”
25394	25400	25401	25401	She	84	“You do n’t like it ? ”
25417	25423	25424	25424	he	761	“I do not like it , ”
25427	25431	25424	25424	he	761	“Sam I Am ? ”
25439	25446	25432	25432	She	84	“ Would you eat it in a box?”Reese
25454	25457	25432	25432	She	84	“ Dr. Seuss fan?”“Green
25470	25487	25432	25432	She	84	” She pulled her shoulders as if to challenge him . But he would n’t argue . “On
25492	25504	25432	25432	She	84	” he said , a note of surprise in his tone . “I
25515	25533	25536	25536	My	0	” She dipped her spoon and lifted it again , still unsure about taking that first bite . “Me
25559	25616	25617	25617	mom	662	” The moment it was out of his mouth , he wanted to retract his words . Never , ever was he sentimental on a date . Stick to business , family only as it had to do with business , likes and dislikes in the most general sense . Rules Merina had obliterated without trying . “Your
25621	25628	25617	25617	mom	662	” Sincerity leached into her expression . “A
25635	25654	25617	25617	mom	662	” He scooped up a bite of the chilled soup . Yep . As awful as he remembered . “There
25667	25676	25617	25617	mom	662	” she said , letting the topic pass . “
25695	25712	25685	25685	I	0	now?”“The truth . I showed up at the Van Heusen in the middle of the night . ”“Because
25715	25719	25617	25617	mom	662	” she prompted . “I
25727	25736	25737	25737	Your	0	” Apparently champagne made him a drippy sentimentalist . “
25740	25745	25737	25737	Your	0	” he corrected quickly . “
25753	25755	25756	25756	she	0	”“Smitten , ”
25759	25761	25756	25756	she	0	“Completely . ”
25860	25870	25871	25871	he	766	“There are a few details we should discuss tonight , ”
25878	25890	25891	25891	you	766	“ We need to coordinate our schedules . Do you have an assistant?”“Are
25894	25921	25922	25922	I	0	” She took a bite , her eyes scrunched in morbid expectation . Then they opened and the expression on her face faded into not bad . “Am
25933	25942	25943	25943	she	0	that?”“Are you joking about me having an assistant , ”
25955	25970	25943	25943	she	0	“ What ’s not to like ? It ’s watermelon . It ’s refreshing . ”“You
25984	25992	25943	25943	she	0	assistant?”“Because I like to do everything myself . ”He
26011	26021	26022	26022	He	766	“Very well , I ’ll send you my schedule . ”
26028	26031	26022	26022	He	766	“Now?”“Why not ? ”
26051	26053	26054	26054	She	0	“Okay . ”
26084	26097	26080	26080	her	0	“ It ’s Harrington , by the way . My middle name . ”Her
26101	26104	26080	26080	her	0	“ Nicole . ”“Okay
26112	26115	26080	26080	her	0	we?”“Let ’s . ”
26277	26287	26288	26288	he	773	“You’ll need to cancel drinks with Lorelei on Tuesday , ”
26294	26307	26288	26288	he	773	“Forget it . I have n’t gone out with her in ages . ”“New
26310	26318	26288	26288	he	773	” he argued , pointing at himself . “
26327	26358	26288	26288	he	773	”Okay . That was fair . The discussion had prompted her to point out how he needed to cancel dinner with a woman named Claudia at an upcoming art show . “Forgot
26362	26376	26377	26377	me	0	” he ’d commented , then tapped a quick note into his phone . “Let
26386	26405	26383	26383	Bobbie	173	flowers?”“No . No date , no flowers . I sent Bobbie a note to cancel and not reschedule . ”Oddly
26622	26628	26630	26630	she	84	“ Bobbie really hates me . ”“No
26634	26653	26618	26618	Merina	84	” He strode out from behind the desk , today in a deep gray suit , red tie . “
26662	26665	26666	26666	She	84	”“Like you ? ”
26670	26673	26666	26666	She	84	“Very funny . ”
26735	26744	26745	26745	Merina	84	“Looks like she did n’t appreciate your flowers , ”
26772	26780	26756	26756	He	773	“ No . This is our advisor . ”Wow
26795	26809	26787	26787	He	773	“ Penelope Brand , I ’d like you to meet Merina Van Heusen , my—”“What
26814	26849	26811	26811	you	790	” Penelope bolted out of her seat . Taking in her posture , Merina considered that Reese was lying . Because this woman was not happy . Then Penelope turned her scowl on Merina . “
26874	26897	26913	26913	Merina	84	other!”Reese sighed and Merina blinked over at him , shocked he was n’t having the blonde escorted out by her golden tan . “I’m
26905	26912	26913	26913	Merina	84	” he said with exaggerated patience . “
26919	26933	26913	26913	Merina	84	” He nodded at a chair and Merina took the back of it . “That
26941	26945	26946	26946	You	790	” Penelope exploded . “
26959	26970	26946	26946	You	790	” She shook her head , looking disappointed and exasperated . “
27003	27022	26984	26984	I	0	”Reese and Merina sat . Penelope , not through yet , lifted her cell phone and read aloud , “
27054	27068	27070	27070	He	796	” She paused to send them each a scolding glare , then continued . “
27162	27167	27149	27153	the one woman in existence	800	feet?’”Merina ’s jaw dropped . “What
27172	27191	27149	27153	the one woman in existence	800	” Reese asked in a tone that suggested he ’d file a lawsuit against them just for fun . “It
27214	27245	27149	27153	the one woman in existence	800	” Penelope frowned and her forehead did n’t so much as pucker . Her skin was porcelain - smooth , her white suit pristine , and her jewelry winking gold . “
27273	27285	27286	27286	Merina	84	”“We coordinated our calendars . We ’re on the same page , ”
27299	27324	27330	27330	She	805	“ A few more dates and I ’m sure the public will see us as a couple . This is just new . They ’re speculating,”Penelope
27350	27410	27341	27341	her	805	“ Merina . You ’re a vibrant , beautiful woman . You ’re in love with a gorgeous , hunky billionaire . You were at a restaurant that served everything but sex on those plates . The reporter who happened to be there expected to see Reese and a mystery woman all but fornicate on top of the table . ”Merina
27413	27423	27330	27330	She	805	“You two walked in sort of cozy according to this reporter”—Penelope
27434	27453	27471	27471	his	807	table—“but you left single file . Reese , you did n’t so much as palm her lower back . ”“He
27457	27461	27469	27469	he	807	” Merina snapped . “
27477	27506	27469	27469	he	807	” She remembered because she ’d been aware of that imprint the entire dinner . She cast a glance at Reese , who raised an eyebrow in interest . “Regardless
27543	27547	27548	27548	Reese	101	”“So we pander , ”
27567	27588	27554	27554	Merina	84	“You hired me to help you convince the world your cold heart has been thawed by a smoking hot romance . ”Even
27664	27673	27640	27640	she	84	“Last night showed how unprepared you two are . ”
27685	27689	27674	27674	Penelope	145	“ Kiss her . ”“What
27691	27704	27640	27640	she	84	” His was a voice of alarm and Merina echoed the sentimentality . “I
27715	27719	27725	27725	Pen	145	” Penelope shrugged . “I’m
27727	27733	27734	27734	Merina	84	”“We can pull it off , ”
27790	27826	27828	27828	her	84	“ Good . In that case , let ’s review your revised schedule of events , because you two are going to need to sell it . And after the next date , if this happens again”—she
27829	27849	27856	27856	her	84	phone—“we will have to reconvene and you will be practicing your PDA for me . Because right now it ’s PDB.”She
27865	27867	27868	27868	Merina	84	“PDB ? ”
27885	27891	27871	27871	Penelope	145	“ Public displays of boredom . ”
27895	27900	27901	27901	Merina	84	“ She ’s intense , ”
27925	27953	27919	27919	Reese	101	“She ’s the best . And she ’s trustworthy . She is n’t going to run to the papers and sell this story for the highest price . ”
27963	27968	27960	27960	his	815	“ She hates reporters . ”Sounded
28002	28007	28008	28008	Merina	84	“She ’s also right , ”
28011	28013	28014	28014	Reese	101	“Yeah , ”
28017	28022	28023	28023	She	84	“Maybe we should practice . ”
28035	28045	28023	28023	She	84	“ So that we ’re comfortable around each other . ”
28126	28139	28140	28140	She	84	“I do n’t have as much experience wooing strangers as you do . ”
28146	28162	28140	28140	She	84	“ I do n’t mean to say I do n’t know what I ’m doing . ”“It
28174	28199	28171	28171	you	84	” He did n’t look worried . Then again , did he ever ? His face was stone , his hands in his pockets . “
28203	28255	28202	28202	you	84	suggest?”His voice came out like a seductive murmur and she could have sworn his eyes dashed to her lips . But she could n’t kiss him here , in his white - and - chrome - and - glass boardroom . On his turf . She needed a few drinks first . “How
28259	28265	28202	28202	you	84	tonight?”“Fine . I ’ll call Tableau and—”“No
28272	28278	28202	28202	you	84	” Somewhere she was comfortable . “
28281	28283	28202	28202	you	84	”“The martini bar?”“Yeah
28293	28304	28285	28285	We	823	” Off his home turf , and nowhere near hers . “Seven
28306	28312	28313	28313	she	84	”“Seven . And , Reese ? ”
28325	28338	28340	28340	his	825	“ If you pick me up yourself , that may be better . ”He
28425	28428	28429	28429	he	825	“Just practicing , ”
28544	28550	28551	28551	I	0	“ What are you two doing here?”“Like
28571	28586	28588	28588	I	0	” her mother told her father as they unloaded the bags on the counter . “And
28611	28622	28601	28601	we	315	” He shook a head of lettuce as he spoke . “We’re
28632	28642	28625	28625	we	315	” her mother said , pulling out fresh tomatoes . “
28654	28669	28670	28670	Mark	126	”“Your mother wants to be healthy . I want to eat at a restaurant . ”
28683	28697	28670	28670	Mark	126	“I mean what are you doing home ? I thought you were working . ”
28736	28747	28748	28749	Her mother	341	“We’re fully staffed if that ’s what you ’re asking . ”
28754	28759	28748	28749	Her mother	341	“ You look beautiful . ”“Thanks
28761	28817	28748	28749	Her mother	341	”And there went the doorbell . Right on time . Reese was n’t so much as thirty seconds late . Merina could have used those thirty seconds to ease her parents into the idea that she was dating the future CEO of the company who ’d purchased their hotel and threatened to fire them all . “Be
28820	28831	28832	28833	an angel	839	” she said , her eyes trained on her father . “I’m
28835	28965	28832	28833	an angel	839	” He did look harmless with a bunch of bananas in one hand and an avocado in the other . Merina ’s parents were n’t old - fashioned , and they were n’t reserved . But they ’d sniff out a wolf in sheep ’s clothing right away , and Reese was definitely that . She opened the door to find him dressed in a dark jacket and gray tie , his scruff light but definitely visible , navy eyes matching his designer jeans . Had she ever seen Reese in jeans before ? He wore them as well as a suit , and whatever pair he ’d chosen had preserved his air of wealth . Though , she was beginning to wonder if that air was simply him . “Hi
28967	29001	28832	28833	an angel	839	” She tracked up from his shiny brown shoes , to a leather belt , to those impossibly long lashes . Then he did something that made her stomach flutter . He grinned . “Hey
29005	29073	29074	29074	Mom	135	” He leaned in , accosting her with a hint of spice from his cologne , and kissed her cheek . On the inside , her nerves rattled , warmth oozing down her spine . On the outside , she was aware of her parents looking on in interest . She gave Reese a wide - eyed here we go look , then turned to her parents . “
29083	29102	29104	29104	Crane	101	”Her father ’s mouth compressed . Her mother folded her arms , a worry line bisecting her brow . “Mr
29106	29110	29104	29104	Crane	101	” she said . “
29115	29119	29120	29120	Merina	84	”“We’ll be back , ”
29136	29138	29120	29120	Merina	84	“Maybe , ”
29158	29165	29166	29166	he	117	“ Drinks may turn into dinner , ”
29173	29177	29169	29169	his	117	“ And dessert . ”Merina
29184	29188	29189	29189	she	84	doing?“He ’s kidding , ”
29219	29248	29216	29216	he	117	“ Mr. and Mrs. Van Heusen , good to see you . I assume Merina told you the remodel and staffing plans have been put on indefinite hold . ”“Hold
29250	29266	29216	29216	he	117	” her father asked , taking Reese ’s hand in a cordial but quick shake . “
29273	29282	29267	29267	She	84	”“Right now we ’re focused on another building . ”“Indefinite
29284	29288	29216	29216	he	117	” Jolie parroted . “
29294	29296	29297	29297	Merina	84	”“Wonderful , ”
29300	29306	29297	29297	Merina	84	“ It ’s wonderful news . ”“Merina
29321	29355	29356	29356	I	0	” He shot a gaze over his shoulder at her and even though her parents could n’t see his expression , it was a smoldering one . Then he turned back to them . “
29370	29374	29375	29376	Her father	2380	”“That she is . ”
29436	29445	29538	29539	the parents	851	“ I did n’t know Posh took reservations . ”“For
29450	29535	29538	29539	the parents	851	” Reese answered . What did Merina expect , to show up at Posh and smash in with the crowd?He took his eyes from the road to check on his date . Merina ’s shoulders were draped in a sheer black wrap over a sleek , short black dress . Her long legs bare and smooth and capped in high heels . He was a leg man and regretted not hiring a driver so he could stare longer . Merina ’s legs were fantastic . “Nice
29547	29561	29562	29562	He	853	smooth?”“Us sewer rats are able to call up sophistication when we need to . ”
29576	29586	29587	29587	She	855	“And that bit about dinner and dessert . Risky . ”
29614	29620	29621	29621	he	853	“Padding the announcement for you , ”
29624	29643	29621	29621	he	853	“ When you tell them about our engagement , they ’ll have to believe we were swept up . ”She
29783	29798	29733	29733	Gwyneth	153	“I meant it was risky because you implied I might not make it home . ”“Well
29806	29911	29913	29913	you	859	”She batted made - up eyes at him and her red lips flinched into a reluctant smile . A surge of attraction shocked his veins . There was something about Merina beyond her physical features that made his libido sit up and beg . Typically with his past dates , the surge of attraction came later , after he had her clothes off . With Merina , the anticipation of having her clothes off fueled his want . Keeping things surface was easier in the long run — less messy . So why , in Merina ’s case , was he looking forward to getting dirty?“What
29915	29917	29918	29918	He	853	about?”“Nothing . ”
30135	30137	30138	30138	he	853	“Darling , ”
30410	30425	30428	30428	him	853	“Downstairs , getting to the bartender is a test of endurance and Midwest manners , ”
30451	30465	30430	30430	she	84	“ You could learn a thing or two from the people down there . ”“That
30472	30547	30468	30468	I	0	” His voice held no challenge , just commanding presence and smooth delivery . Like he meant it . Maybe he did . She was beginning to think she could learn a thing or two from him as well . Their waiter , flamboyantly dressed in short shorts , a cropped hot pink top , and slatted sunglasses , returned with their drink order . He passed down her cosmopolitan and Reese ’s scotch . “
30552	30558	30559	30559	Merina	84	people?”“No , thanks , Kevin . ”
30570	30575	30562	30562	he	884	“You bet , Mer . ”He
30593	30598	30584	30584	she	84	“How ’s your stereotypically feminine cocktail?”Ah
30604	30612	30625	30625	his	884	“Fruity . How ’s your exhaustingly cliché manly drink?”He
30641	30648	30649	30649	he	884	“It ’s always what I expect , ”
30663	30679	30655	30655	He	884	“ Yours is to the discretion and capabilities of the bartender . Mine never wavers . ”“Do
30689	30695	30687	30687	Crane	101	” She cocked her head . “
30702	30757	30657	30657	his	884	”His features darkened , and in those shadows she saw a man who ’d experienced the unexpected once upon a time , and it bit him in the ass . Then the shadows receded and that cocksure , bored mask she ’d grown used to slid into place . What are you hiding , Reese Crane?“Reliability
30762	30785	30657	30657	his	884	” he stated . Was it a business failure he ’d been turning over in his head , or one of the personal variety?“Structured
30788	30800	30687	30687	Crane	101	” she guessed . He shrugged one of his big shoulders . “
30830	30876	30822	30822	Mom	135	”Was . He ’d mentioned his mother at dinner too . Merina wondered how long ago he ’d lost her . How much her loss affected her sons and her husband . She imagined the pain of losing someone that beloved would linger a lifetime . “You
30878	30907	30908	30908	parents	2608	” He sipped his drink . She wished she could crack open his head and see what he was thinking . His controlled facial expressions hid his thoughts . “My
30941	30953	30919	30919	they	2608	”“Do you think my family worships at the altar of the almighty dollar?”“Not
30958	31091	30919	30919	they	2608	” she said with a smile . The challenging glint in his eye told her he knew she was teasing him . Between them , heat flared . It was the same spark she ’d felt each time she was around him . Given her spiking pulse and heated neck , she ’d assumed it was rage . Now she was questioning whether the attraction was real . Sure , she was being purposefully receptive to him , but there was something else going on . Who knew the first time she felt that long - gone spark it would be with a man she should n’t even like ? He was impossible not to admire … which was upsetting . Palpable heat snapped the air between them as he leaned closer . “Parents
31098	31102	30919	30919	they	2608	” Reese said . “
31116	31121	31122	31122	She	887	Hobbies?”“That ’s pretty dry . ”
31281	31291	31292	31292	she	887	beat?“What about the emotional hurtles we have to leap ? ”
31295	31306	31292	31292	she	887	“ You ’re a good two feet away from me . ”“Maybe
31311	31324	31292	31292	she	887	” he said after gauging the distance on the couch between them . “
31326	31340	31292	31292	she	887	maybe”—he moved closer , lifting his body and bringing it within a foot of hers—“I’m
31348	31386	31342	31342	I	0	”His dark blue eyes sparkled in the club ’s lighting . She felt something when he scooted closer , but frightened was n’t her dominant emotion . Intrigued . Interested . Fascinated . There were some words . “I
31392	31397	31342	31342	I	0	” Her voice dipped . “No
31399	31516	31342	31342	I	0	” He came closer , so close his jeans brushed her bare knee . He abandoned his drink on the low table in front of him and then did the same with hers , freeing the hand she now did n’t know what to do with . Sifting her hair through his fingers , he leaned closer , firm , but full lips parting as her heart thundered against her breast . Her face went hot . Her throat constricted . This close , he was as powerful as a transformer , causing a buzz she felt in every last one of her neglected erogenous zones . An inch from her mouth , Reese bit out , “
31522	31533	31517	31517	We	893	”Not … what she expected . She blinked , surprised . “Reporter
31535	31618	31517	31517	We	893	” he said . She started to ask where , but a flash among many flashes came from the direction of the crowd below . Then Reese did something that made her heart lift . He grinned . A natural , easy , toothy grin , paired with a flick of his eyes like he was checking her out . With his hand , he cupped her nape . Just a light brush before he leaned close and whispered in her ear , “
31621	31638	31517	31517	We	893	”A shiver raced down her spine at the feel of his warm breath against her skin . “First
31647	31796	31517	31517	We	893	” He pressed his lips to her jaw and for a scant moment she forgot about the reporter snapping away down there . She was too overtaken by the rough scrape of his facial hair on her softer skin , the smell of him enveloping her . She shut her eyes . This time the flashes of light came from behind her eyelids when his mouth closed over hers . It was n’t hard to lean into him . Her hand grabbed hold of his suit jacket before she realized . And when he slanted his mouth and just the tip of his tongue touched to her bottom lip , she whimpered . He pulled back too soon . His eyes were heated , his hand moving from her neck and brushing her bared shoulder . Okay . Kissing Reese Crane was not going to be a hardship . “Not
31799	31857	31858	31858	We	894	” he said , his easygoing smile likely for the paparazzi below . A pang of disappointment tingled in her breastbone . She should n’t care that he was acting . This was n’t real . She did n’t want it to be real . His fingers continued playing in her hair . He was still close . “
31870	31872	31873	31873	She	895	”“Dinner ? ”
31876	31879	31873	31873	She	895	“And dessert . ”“Dessert
31881	31897	31873	31873	She	895	” She ’d turned into a parrot , squawking his every utterance back at him . “Though
31907	31958	31873	31873	She	895	” He leaned in and pressed his mouth to hers for a quick kiss . Stubble abraded her chin . She reached up and stroked his face , unsure now if the flashing was the club lighting or if this moment would also show up on the Internet tomorrow morning . “Okay
31960	31972	31873	31873	She	895	” she whispered , then ran a fingernail down his jawline . “
31977	32240	31873	31873	She	895	” * * * Reese felt as if he was vibrating when she scraped his jaw , then his lower lip with her finger . Every inch of him — including the several aching ones in his pants — wanted to take her by the back of the head and kiss her until they were both panting . The need was so visceral , so … animal , he sat back some . The idea behind the kiss was to give the reporter some fodder . Penelope may have asked they do a little PDA , not maul Merina in full view of downtown Chicago . He pulled her hair back into place , all those silken , honey - colored strands falling softly against her shoulders . Everything about her was soft and warm and inviting , except for when she spoke . Then she was barbed and feisty . Both sides did it for him , and he could n’t for the life of him figure out why . Though , this relationship came with a safety net . They could fight all they wanted , and she could n’t go anywhere until the deed was done . So to speak . He was n’t sure how they ’d survive a six - month marriage without further exploring the heat that had flared between them . As first kisses went , that one was the most memorable . Hell , he could n’t recall a single kiss in the past that made him as interested in more . With Merina , “
32242	32341	31873	31873	She	895	” was n’t guaranteed . Even though a wedding was . He turned his head to see if the reporter was gone . She was n’t , but she was no longer aiming her camera at them . She was scrolling through her phone , a smile on her face . He went out with her once , years and years ago . Could n’t remember her name now , but she did n’t appear the least bit heartbroken . She looked like she was mentally counting the extra zeroes in her paycheck after she sold those photos . “Oh
32344	32348	32342	32342	God	129	” Merina uttered . “What
32350	32366	31873	31873	She	895	” He was on alert , scoping out the club for more reporters or photographers . “You
32371	32373	32368	32368	her	896	”“What ? ”
32428	32433	32435	32435	her	896	“ Why would you say that?”She
32446	32464	32465	32465	She	896	“How am I going to keep up with your long , long , long list of ladies ? ”
32480	32511	32465	32465	She	896	“ If I were the one sleeping with half the men in the city , I would be painted as the slutty girl and they ’d say you were slumming . ”“Merina
32513	32535	32465	32465	She	896	” He shook his head . There was a double standard , but he had to call her on that untruth . “
32550	32581	32536	32537	No one	2393	” She was too bright , too poised . Nothing like the one - night - only women he ’d been seeing since Gwyneth had incinerated what they had together . “Wanna
32584	32617	32536	32537	No one	2393	” She snagged his tie and tugged , not hard , just enough to see if he ’d come the rest of the way . He did , too intrigued not to . “Sure
32625	32651	32619	32619	I	0	”“I ca n’t shake your hand because we ’d look too businessy , so I had to improvise and go with a tie - tug . ”“Good
32654	32678	32619	32619	I	0	”She grinned in response before her eyes slipped to his mouth . All he could think of was taking her lips captive again . “Five
32694	32698	32681	32681	I	0	” she said . “You’re
32701	32707	32710	32710	she	0	”“You’re going down , Crane , ”
32821	32823	32817	32817	he	896	“ tame ”
32839	32846	32847	32848	her mother	341	“Well , you ’re smiley today , ”
32860	32865	32847	32848	her mother	341	“ And up early . ”Merina
32881	32883	32847	32848	her mother	341	“ dates ”
32890	32902	32903	32903	Jolie	91	“I noticed you were home early from your date last Friday . ”
32911	32912	32905	32905	herself	0	“ Warmer?”“I’m
32915	33262	33263	33263	father	348	” She sipped her half - full cup and debated what to tell her mom about the date , but she did n’t have long to think it through when Jolie sat down across from her with her own mug . After they left Posh , she and Reese went to dinner at a restaurant Merina could n’t remember the name of . Some fancy place with soft lighting and artful blocks of wood acting as tables . Dinner was incredible , and the conversation flowed rather than being forced . It seemed their first for - public kiss had set them both at ease . The evening ended by ten , and he walked her to her door , dropping a kiss on her lips that made her want more . She was n’t sure what to do with that , so she decided to count it in the plus column for their ruse . It was unlikely but possible there was a paparazzo in the bushes . Better safe than sorry . She had n’t seen him since and was now mentally readying herself for seeing him tonight . She hoped the meeting - like atmosphere would help quell some of her nerves . Penelope had requested getting together at Reese ’s house . At the idea of seeing Reese ’s private lair , Merina felt fifty shades of nervous . Who knew what lurked behind his gargantuan mostly - unused Lake Shore Drive home ? When she received the address via e - mail from Bobbie , Merina Googled it . The aerial view alone was drool - worthy . There was a pool out back . Fountains out front . Three manicured acres surrounded the building . The fifteen - thousand - square - foot house was sold to Reese nine years ago . She ’d tried digging up a few pictures of the interior but only found one of the foyer and double staircase sweeping up each side and a small half bath in who knew what part of the house . “Your
33282	33293	33278	33278	I	0	” Jolie said . Slowly , Merina lowered her mug . “Why
33338	33345	33333	33333	he	912	” Her mother ’s lips pursed . “
33364	33462	33486	33486	you	917	”She was n’t wrong . Merina had met Tag once before . He was the youngest brother and despite not having an affinity for long hair , she ’d been completely taken by his charm and easy smile . Fun - loving Tag was more her style , but she ’d received a proposal from the brother who was dark and closed off and irritating . Until Reese was kissing her . Then he was none of those things . He was delicious and warm and tasted like spice cake . Or maybe that was the scotch . “We
33469	33485	33486	33486	you	917	” Merina said , lifting her mug so she would n’t have to say more . “Are
33492	33506	33486	33486	you	917	” Her mother ’s eyebrows crawled up her forehead . At the mention of “
33509	33549	33486	33486	you	917	” she again imagined loosening his tie . Why she was so focused on that one article of clothing , she had no idea . Maybe because she ’d never seen him without one . Merina cleared her throat . “
33558	33560	33561	33562	Her mother	341	”“Tonight . ”
33565	33578	33561	33562	Her mother	341	“ Mer , you do know what you ’re doing , do n’t you?”“Of
33581	33596	33599	33599	sweetheart	2698	” She was marrying a billionaire to gain possession of her family ’s hotel . “I
33601	33609	33599	33599	sweetheart	2698	” Her mother ’s brow creased further . “
33611	33613	33614	33614	Merina	84	Corbin—”“Mom . ”
33678	33688	33689	33689	Merina	84	“Are you and Dad going into the office late ? ”
33699	33710	33689	33689	Merina	84	“Probably this afternoon . Your father is n’t feeling well . ”Merina
33756	33771	33772	33773	Her mother	341	“Just a sore throat . Not his heart . He ’s fine , Mer . ”
33932	33946	33918	33919	Bob Barber	173	“ Sometimes these things shake out and there ’s nothing to worry about . ”“Sure
33948	34038	33918	33919	Bob Barber	173	” Reese said , but Bob ’s words were meaningless . The forty - minute meeting where they discussed numbers was what mattered . After they closed their leather binders and started talking about drinks downtown , whatever they said was null and void . He refused to feel good about it , but at the same time , this was not his problem . At least they had n’t brought up his new relationship . He supposed a few more appearances in their vicinity would make them notice . “Shit
34040	34078	34080	34080	them	932	” Tag said from behind him after the last board member was out the door . Reese turned to his brother . Tag scrubbed a hand over his beard . He was frowning . Tag rarely frowned . “According
34086	34098	34099	34099	Tag	109	”“I do n’t want to wait until things go tits up . ”
34115	34119	34123	34123	they	932	“We’re in agreement . ”“I’d
34130	34135	34136	34136	Reese	101	”“Welcome to the club . ”
34145	34164	34136	34136	Reese	101	“ Do n’t worry . Once they hear about the engagement , you ’ll fade into the background . ”“Let
34168	34172	34136	34136	Reese	101	” Tag stood . “
34189	34193	34194	34194	Reese	101	”“Like eight years , ”
34204	34208	34201	34201	Tag	109	“ Around that . ”In
34243	34245	34246	34246	Reese	101	“Can’t , ”
34249	34269	34246	34246	Reese	101	“ I ’m seeing Merina tonight , so my drinks will be had with her . And Penelope Brand . ”“The
34273	34275	34246	34246	Reese	101	”“No . ”“Not
34278	34290	34291	34291	She	937	” His brother held out both hands like he was surrendering . “
34302	34318	34297	34297	I	0	” He swept his legal pad off the boardroom table and walked toward the door . “
34325	34330	34333	34333	his	438	”“Will do . And , Tag?”His
34340	34346	34333	34333	his	438	“Rain check on the drinks . ”“I’ll
34354	34709	34333	34333	his	438	” Tag ’s lips lifted into a smile . Then he was gone . The drive to his house was n’t far , but Reese felt every mile like it was being branded into his skin . The one thing he had n’t anticipated when Penelope suggested the three of them meet at his Lake Shore Drive home was that his memories of it would rear up and try and take him out . He’d returned to the house on occasion . It was n’t like he had a phobia , but the structure was n’t what he ’d call inviting . The room he and Gwyneth shared , the memories they made were etched into the walls . He was n’t going to cower — but he could n’t say he was pleased about the idea of moving in there with Merina . His throat went tight at the thought of sharing the space with a woman a second time . He pulled his shoulders as he drove , mentally compartmentalizing the years he ’d spent with Gwyneth . No matter what awaited him behind the front door , he was n’t going to allow himself to be hurt all over again . Especially by old business . He was no longer the hopeful twenty - five - year - old who would get raked in by a purposeful pout . He was a grown man , his legacy within reach . The discomfort he felt at being here was nothing more than an inconvenience . He pulled up to the gate and pressed his finger to the security touchpad . The iron bars swung outward , opening to the lush garden he hoped survived the cool spring . He ’d hired landscapers to plant colorful flowers and clean the fountains and pool , and perform whatever other maintenance was required to get the house wedding - ready . Plenty more flowers were being trucked in for the big day that was in actuality a small affair , but his wedding planner was exuberant and he ’d let her talk him into indulging . “It
34715	35147	35463	35463	I	0	” she ’d told him , hearts mingling with dollar signs in her eyes . He ’d thought of Merina and how this was her first marriage , too . Just because he wanted to get this over with was no reason to rob her of doing things right . More flowers were the least he could do . He parked his car — a Porsche for driving around town — in the garage and walked a path to the front door , his stomach heavy . The paved walkway to the door was one Gwyneth hated and had complained about often . She ’d wanted white stone instead of gray . At the front door , he recalled the Christmas wreath she ’d ordered that was so massive , it hid the doorknob . The doorknob he grabbed now . His palm was damp . His heartbeat erratic . It ’s a house . A gargantuan monstrosity he could barely find his way around in . A piece of real estate he ’d purchased because he ’d made a lot of money quickly and needed to move out of his father ’s house . When Gwyneth left and Reese relocated to his suite in Crane Hotel , he still did n’t get rid of it . One of his heroes was Howard Hughes , but it did n’t mean Reese had to follow him into lunacy . Papers wrote stories and were always looking for an angle . Sleeping in his suite looked as if he worked a lot of overtime , but living there without an actual home ? He did n’t need reports that he ’d lost his marbles or that he was weak . He was not weak . This house was a symbol of his success , and it made good business sense to keep it . It also happened to be a place where he ’d never really belonged . He turned the knob just as it began to rain . * * * Rain pelted the windows of the formal dining room . Merina sat next to Reese , feeling tension radiate from him . He wore his usual dark suit and neutral expression , but his lips were slightly pursed and the skin around his eyes looked tight . She ’d noticed it when he set foot in the foyer where she and Penelope stood chatting . At first she ’d thought he must be upset about work , but when Penelope asked for a tour , he ’d denied her with a curt “
35150	35194	35463	35463	I	0	” then led them into the dining room . Suspicious . Then again , he did n’t live here . Was it that surprising he did n’t like his own house?So many unanswered questions . All of which she stowed when Penelope announced , “
35197	35382	35463	35463	I	0	” after tapping her phone in silence for a few minutes . They’d started the meeting with glasses of wine , Reese ’s half drunk , Pen ’s untouched , Merina ’s gone . Reese had requested the housekeeper , Magda , give them privacy , which was a shame . Merina could use a refill . She’d expected his mansion to reflect Crane Hotels : white and black and glass . For the most part , she was n’t wrong . Though instead of white , the interior consisted mostly of shining cream - colored floors and thick gold drapes , black furniture and modern - styled lighting . The dining room was considerably warmer with low - hanging shaded lights overhead and a centerpiece with live plants running the length of the black granite table . Merina had n’t hidden her surprise at the sheer size and beauty of Reese ’s mansion . She ’d lingered out front earlier , admiring her soon - to - be home . She could n’t believe she was actually going to get to live here . “I
35389	35429	35463	35463	I	0	” Penelope rubbed her hands together , a bright smile on her face . The excited gleam in her eyes was even more worrisome than when she ’d railed on them back at Reese ’s office the other day . “
35446	35450	35439	35439	I	0	” she said . “
35489	35494	35495	35495	Merina	84	”“That came really fast , ”
35498	35503	35504	35504	Reese	101	“Whirlwind romance , remember ? ”
35544	35600	35507	35507	He	943	“It ’s fast enough that tongues will be wagging , which is what you want . This needs to be big , a sensation on the gossip outlets . The more attention you get , the more speculation you ’ll have , so be sure you ’re always ‘ on , ’ no matter what . ”“Like
35607	35611	35507	35507	He	943	” Merina said . “Exactly
35613	35623	35624	35624	We	804	” Pen looked pleased . Reese looked … weird . “
35633	35637	35624	35624	We	804	” Pen continued , “
35656	35662	35652	35652	Reese	101	” She looked to Reese . “
35667	35669	35670	35670	He	943	that?”“Tomorrow . ”
35710	35712	35713	35713	Pen	145	“Perfect , ”
35716	35761	35762	35762	She	84	“ Merina , you ’ll need to begin moving your things soon . After the wedding , there ’ll be no more going home for any reason . Happily married couples spend all their time together . You two are infatuated . Remember that . ”
35773	35784	35762	35762	She	84	“I’ll have Bobbie send movers to collect Merina ’s things . ”
35810	35818	35790	35790	his	943	“ Just let her know what day . ”He
35884	35903	35904	35904	Pen	145	“Merina needs to see the house . Is it later yet ? I ’d still love a tour , ”
35907	35911	35904	35904	Pen	145	“I’ll arrange it . ”
35978	35995	35996	35996	He	943	“I have to get back to the office , but Tilly will show you the house . ”
36004	36020	36028	36028	he	943	“ She ’s the house manager . Penelope , good to see you . Merina . ”
36037	36040	36041	36041	Penelope	145	going?“Don’t worry , ”
36044	36077	36041	36041	Penelope	145	“ I ’ve been coordinating with the wedding planner . You have a fitting appointment for your dress tomorrow afternoon , and I ’ll forward the other details via e - mail . ”
36101	36118	36093	36093	Satin	179	“ Everything is being taken care of . All you have to do is show up . ”“I
36124	36167	36169	36169	honey	952	” Merina said numbly . Reese was behaving more disconnected than before and she was expected to plan everything with Penelope and Bobbie . And what was she going to tell her parents ? Suddenly everything was so real . Too real . “Well
36191	36365	36087	36087	her	84	”Those words still echoed in Merina ’s mind when she went to Sash & Satin the next afternoon . In the dressing room , she slipped into the wedding gown , a backless satin sheath with lace overlays . The straps were made up of fabric flowers skimming over her shoulders . She pulled her hair back , holding it at the nape of her neck and watched a shock of blond fall over one eye . Then she lost strength in her legs and plunked into the puffy pink chair provided for brides - to - be as devastation washed over her like a rogue wave . Her first wedding . Her first wedding dress . But no one was here , not Lorelei , not her mother . Pen had made the instructions clear last night : until Reese gave Merina a ring ( he promised it ’d be today ) , Merina was under a gag order . Even with Lorelei , who Merina had to reveal knew the truth . “We
36371	36515	36516	36518	Ms. Van Heusen	104	” Pen had warned when she and Merina strolled through the corridors and giant rooms of Reese ’s house yesterday . Merina ’s eyes burned . She had the strong urge to sit in her wedding dress in this boutique and bawl her eyes out . Which was exactly why she gritted her teeth , stood , and smoothed her beautiful wedding gown with both hands . She tucked her hair behind her ears and swallowed the lump of emotion trying to take her down . She had to remember why she was doing this . Because the hotel meant everything to her and her parents . This was a business arrangement . One she made because the Van Heusen was a landmark and deserved to be treated with respect . A tap on the door came and a soft feminine voice called , “
36523	36526	36516	36518	Ms. Van Heusen	104	fitting?”“Almost perfect . ”
36555	36560	36564	36564	she	104	“ Maybe just a few alter—”Her
36708	36711	36712	36712	Merina	84	“You’re here . ”
36969	36975	36977	36977	Crane	101	“That ’s a beautiful dress . ”“Mr
36979	36996	36977	36977	Crane	101	” A petite brunette entered the oversized dressing area and delivered a glass of sparkling water . “
37025	37028	37029	37029	He	957	”“Excuse me ? ”
37048	37070	37072	37072	she	973	“ To see your bride for the first time in the dress you ’ll be marrying her in is quite something . ”
37092	37100	37085	37085	Her	84	“I’ll just give you two a minute , ”
37133	37142	37143	37143	Merina	84	“I did n’t expect you to be here . ”
37152	37176	37177	37177	He	957	“Me neither . I was going to call you tonight , but I was close by . Pen told me about your appointment . ”
37221	37230	37209	37209	he	957	“ I ’m surprised you ’re here alone . ”

38129	38140	38141	38141	She	128	“ You know this is all for pretend , right ? ”
38151	38159	38141	38141	She	128	“If you do not tell me how he proposed”—she

38454	38461	38463	38463	we	1002	” Lorelei waved a dismissive hand . “Yeah

39067	39083	39064	39064	Jolie	91	“ She directed me to a website where your love life has been openly broadcasted . ”Great
39121	39140	39141	39142	Her mother	341	“You and Reese were spotted at a bridal shop , and I told her there was no way … ”
39232	39244	39211	39212	her father	2380	“I wanted to tell you , but everything happened so fast . ”
39259	39265	39266	39266	he	2380	“I do n’t like it , ”
39269	39278	39266	39266	he	2380	“Well , it ’s not up to you . ”
39299	39304	39309	39309	she	84	“ I ’m sorry . I’m”—she
39329	39331	39332	39332	you	84	truth—“drunk . ”“Were
39339	39344	39349	39349	you	84	” her father asked . “Dad!”“Sweetheart
39362	39366	39349	39349	you	84	” Jolie asked . “I
39370	39378	39349	39349	you	84	” That was the truth , anyway . “
39407	39439	39402	39402	you	2380	” Merina grasped the edge of the counter as the room swayed . She chugged down the rest of her water in greedy gulps before surrendering the glass to the sink . “Saturday
39441	39447	39402	39402	you	2380	” Her mother looked aghast . “Yes
39466	39475	39456	39456	I	0	”Jolie raced over and grasped Merina ’s face . “
39496	39508	39509	39509	I	0	”Merina put a palm over one of her mother ’s hands . “
39514	39540	39509	39509	I	0	I”—she swallowed and told another lie , hoping to God she ’d remember how to tell the truth once she was through with this charade . “
39546	39574	39580	39580	I	0	”The phrase came out as if said while her mouth was full of peanut butter , lilting at the end so it sounded more like a question . “We
39590	39594	39580	39580	I	0	”“But your dress … ”
39626	39632	39623	39623	she	341	“You were busy at work , ”
39647	39654	39644	39644	she	84	“ You ’ll see it Saturday , ”
39704	39719	39720	39720	His	2380	“ This is the wrong time to do this . Better head to bed . ”
39831	40005	39806	39806	You	1040	” was how Penelope Brand had described the day when she texted her congratulations on Saturday morning . Merina could state with conviction that the weather was not her main concern . Her goal was simple : Remain in the here and now , standing in front of God and her parents , her best friend , and the man to whom she ’d soon be lawfully we d , without passing out or bursting into tears . And she did n’t mean tears of joy . For most of the ceremony , she ’d kept her focus on Reese ’s bow tie . His tux was stunning black , his dark blue eyes welcoming , his hair perfect . Her dress had been altered , the lace fitted snugly , the back low but not too low . Her ring was now paired with the matching wedding band and the weight of it on her hand was almost overwhelming . She was in the process of being married . Unbelievable . On her “
40008	40095	39806	39806	You	1040	” side of the room were Reese ’s father , Alex , his brother Tag , and a man named Bob , who Reese had referred to as a member of the board . Merina did n’t like Bob . It was partly his fault she was in this mess . The officiant ’s voice was a distant murmur saying words she ’d heard before at friends ’ and family members ’ weddings , only now those recited promises were coming from her lips . Things like “
40101	40103	39806	39806	You	1040	” and “
40108	40110	39806	39806	You	1040	” and “
40117	40169	39806	39806	You	1040	”Part of her screamed from the inside that she was essentially lying and the lying part of her argued that for now , at least , she meant it . This marriage would die when Reese became CEO of Crane Hotels . So that sort of counted . The officiant said , “
40176	40297	40170	40170	You	1042	” and Merina thought she was ready for Reese ’s mouth on hers again . She was wrong . His kiss was as heady as it had been before and even in the midst of uncertainty she found herself leaning in . She did n’t have to fake her physical attraction to him . Not even a little . The marriage may be for show , but her reaction to him was very real . How could he taste this good , feel this good if this was supposed to be pretend ? He deepened the kiss and she stood on her toes to get closer , aware of Tag cutting in with a sharp whistle and a shout of , “
40300	40435	40170	40170	You	1042	yeah!”She lowered to her heels as applause engulfed them . Reese kept his gaze locked to hers , and she wondered if his smile was as genuine as his kiss . * * * The reception was a tidy affair , by Reese ’s choice . He may have let his wedding planner go overboard with the flowers out front , but inside was a neat buffet - style table . Well , mostly neat . She ’d littered the table with candles . Reese plated up a selection of meats and cheeses aside Merina as their guests lined up behind them to do the same . He ’d tried to read her during the ceremony as much as he ’d tried to manage his facial expressions . He was n’t nervous , but the “
40438	40621	39806	39806	You	1040	” part made him twitchy . He did n’t take promises or commitments lightly . But then he reminded himself that was why he was marrying Merina in the first place . Her parents were in attendance , as well as her best friend - slash - lawyer , Lorelei Monson . He ’d learned shortly after issuing the prenup that Ms. Monson was in the know about what was really going on between him and Merina , but given her best friend and client had something to gain and plenty to lose , Reese trusted the other woman to keep the knowledge to herself . She seemed to be on board with the whole thing , save for a few sharp , assessing looks she ’d shot him during the ceremony — and oh , look , there was one now . He ’d survived steelier scowls than hers . In the board member department , Bob and a particularly unsavory character , Ronald Dice , stood behind Reese , but Dice had largely ignored them while he plated his food . “Thank
40624	40641	39806	39806	You	1040	” Merina said as he handed her a set of silverware wrapped in a cloth napkin . “Champagne
40645	40655	40622	40622	you	1044	” he asked . He could use a scotch . “Oh
40665	40693	40661	40661	We	1045	” Her smile was faint and her voice heavy . Reese leaned close and under the guise of placing a kiss at her temple , he said , “
40707	40868	40661	40661	We	1045	” He heard the sharp intake of breath , watched her breasts lift with the inhale . They may be partying , marrying , for show , but their reaction to each other was so grounded it practically vibrated the floor . When he ’d put his lips to hers during the ceremony , she ’d softened , her rigid shoulders lowering , her body loosening . Then she came closer and held on to him . Attraction was not something they ’d have to fake — good news , considering they ’d need to convince the media as well as the board — but the implications of being truly attracted to the woman he lived with could prove dangerous . And fun . If he allowed himself to have a little . Correction : If Merina allowed him to have a little . He drew back , pleased to see an answering heat in the depths of her eyes . “
40871	40886	40887	40887	I	0	” He nodded to their table and handed off their plates to a waiter . “
40895	40900	40901	40901	Her	0	”“Thank you , Reese . ”
40935	40944	40945	40945	Dice	185	“You make a beautiful bride , Mrs. Crane , ”
40978	40998	40999	40999	He	185	“ Quite the speedy nuptials . Making me wonder if you two kids have gotten yourselves into a pickle . ”
41037	41044	41045	41045	Reese	101	“Ronald Dice . Goes by Dice , ”
41052	41086	41045	41045	Reese	101	“ He ’s been with the board for over twelve years . His wife , Monica , was n’t able to make it . I hear she ’s on another trip to Cancun ? ”
41140	41148	41149	41149	Merina	84	“Too bad she could n’t make it , ”
41193	41197	41198	41198	Dice	185	“Yes . Well . ”
41203	41208	41200	41200	his	185	“ Again , congrats . ”
41295	41301	41302	41302	she	84	“Not a bad first wedding , ”
41321	41337	41302	41302	she	84	“No one would know it was your first . You handled it like a pro . ”She
41344	41355	41302	41302	she	84	“ Me ? Sure you ’ve never done this before , Crane?”“Positive
41357	41391	41302	41302	she	84	” He leaned close and she did n’t move an inch . Her eyes flicked to his lips and their guests immediately lifted their forks and rang the silverware against their crystal glasses . “We
41396	41410	41302	41302	she	84	” she breathed , her face flushing the most attractive shade of pink . “Shame
41412	41500	41302	41302	she	84	” he murmured , then leaned the rest of the way to place a soft kiss on her mouth . They lingered and the ringing sound faded into another wolf whistle from Tag and a few female giggles . Reese pulled his face away to admire his gorgeous bride in white , lit by candlelight . Kissing for the public was a task he ’d expected , but feeling it , responding to it was n’t . He shifted in his seat , attraction lingering between them . “Cake
41502	41679	41725	41725	movers	2924	” Tag shouted . The perfect segue . Reese wondered if his brother saw something in the kiss that made him think Reese might need a reprieve . The formality was quick , Reese slicing the cake , Merina feeding him a bite , and him returning the favor . Whether it was the champagne making her ballsy , or she was trying to kill him , he could n’t be sure , but when he gave her the bite of cake , her lips closed over his finger and sucked . A muscle in his jaw twitched , but his bride did n’t let up , pulling his finger from her mouth so slowly , he thought he might die . Vixen . Guests came to retrieve slices of cake and congratulate the happy couple if they had n’t already . Merina ’s father , Mark , offered a hand and said congratulations , along with Jolie , who did the same . Reese accepted their handshakes , but they still did n’t look convinced . “Where
41684	41693	41725	41725	movers	2924	” Jolie asked , cake plate in hand . “It
41698	41702	41725	41725	movers	2924	” Reese answered . “Will
41711	41722	41725	41725	movers	2924	” Jolie asked Merina , sadness stealing into her expression . “Reese
41728	41756	41725	41725	movers	2924	” Merina answered , her tone soothing . These two were close . Keeping such a big secret from her mother had been a lot to ask . “Well
41772	41776	41770	41770	sweetheart	2698	” Jolie said . “Mom
41789	41797	41798	41798	I	0	” Merina sighed when they walked away . “
41803	41806	41807	41807	Reese	101	”“Do you ? ”
41847	41853	41839	41839	He	185	“ We ’re being watched . ”“We
41862	41921	41839	41839	He	185	” she replied . Reese kissed her ear , then her neck , pleased when she tipped her head to give him room . She might not know the effects her bared skin and tempting perfume had on him , but she certainly knew what she was doing when she backed her ass into his crotch and wiggled . “Merina
41923	41935	41839	41839	He	185	” He grasped her waist , his voice a low growl . “Trying
41941	41954	41839	41839	He	185	” she whispered , half turning to give him a saucy wink . “I
41963	41967	41839	41839	He	185	” he said . “
41975	41979	41980	41980	she	0	”“The rocket part ? ”
41987	41989	41980	41980	she	0	“Vixen . ”
42152	42158	42180	42180	Reese	101	all?“Is that my pet name ? ”
42236	42243	42233	42233	he	1060	“ You ’ll pay for that . ”She
42262	42264	42265	42265	Reese	101	“Champagne . ”
42270	42295	42233	42233	he	1060	“ I ’ll be back . If pictures of me end up hashtagged by morning , I ’m telling everyone it ’s your fault . ”She
42314	42316	42317	42317	Lorelei	127	“Girrrrl . ”
42343	42350	42317	42317	Lorelei	127	“ He looks good in black . ”
42390	42396	42397	42397	Merina	84	“He looks good in everything , ”
42407	42416	42397	42397	Merina	84	“Good , yes , but you ’re beautiful . ”Merina
42431	42435	42397	42397	Merina	84	“ Thank you . ”“I’m
42438	42485	42486	42486	I	0	” Lore looked around the dining room . The doors were opened to the foyer where the ceremony had taken place . Candles were lit , white roses were strung , and every inch of the mansion open to guests was gleaming and warm and romantic . “
42496	42558	42560	42560	Malcolm	134	”Her best friend bemoaned her six - hundred - square - foot apartment for the thousandth time , and Merina had to smile . Lore had picked the place , justifying that with her heavy workload she ’d be at the office most of the time . But ever since she ’d made partner she ’d complained about wanting a house . “Where
42562	42605	42607	42607	him	1065	” Honestly , Merina was surprised her friend came stag . Lorelei gave a shrug that said she did n’t care , but it was a purposeful deflection . Lore cared too much about Malcolm . And Malcolm not enough about her . “I’ll
42615	42622	42607	42607	him	1065	” Merina said , meaning it . “Pfft
42627	42637	42638	42638	You	1067	” Lorelei made a shooing motion with her hand . “
42670	42680	42666	42666	I	0	”“Well , Tag ’s single . Want me to introduce you?”“No
42682	42691	42666	42666	I	0	” Lorelei gave her a slow eye blink . “
42697	42716	42717	42717	you	1070	him?”Tag moved in the background , hair down and huge arms straining the confines of his dress shirt . “Whatever
42724	42731	42717	42717	you	1070	” Merina admitted . Tag practically had “
42737	42785	42717	42717	you	1070	” stenciled across his broad back . Reese returned with the champagne right then and Merina accepted the glass . Her brand - new husband radiated control . Confidence . Stubbornness . Each of those qualities more attractive given they were wrapped in such a glorious package . “I’m
42793	42799	42800	42800	Reese	101	” Lorelei cordially excused herself . “
42817	42829	42830	42830	Reese	101	”“Exactly what I ’d expect you to say , Ms. Monson , ”
42844	42859	42839	42839	he	1072	“ She ’s warming up to me . Any chance your parents will do the same?”“Ha
42861	42867	42839	42839	he	1072	” Merina sipped her champagne . “
42881	43010	43012	43012	Bob	173	”Mark and Jolie may have experienced their own whirlwind love story , but theirs was rooted in everlasting love . The engagement started on State Street in Chicago around Christmas . Near the ice rink , snow falling , Jolie ’s tears of joy freezing to her face as Mark knelt before her , ring offered and snow seeping into his dress pants . Merina ’s mother liked to tell the tale of how she and Mark checked into a high - end hotel in a crappy compact car and handed their duffel bags over to the valet . They did n’t belong in this world then , but they ’d carved out room for themselves . Her parents saw Chicago as a place they made their own . “Neither
43014	43028	43012	43012	Bob	173	” Reese said of the friendlier board member Merina was introduced to earlier . “
43036	43103	43012	43012	Bob	173	” He said this with his voice dropped and his face close to her ear . Goose bumps sprang to life on her arms and legs in response . Nearly everything about him caused an answering physical reaction . Tag approached with an easygoing swagger , golden hair rolling over the shoulders of his royal blue button - down almost to the middle of his arms . “You
43110	43128	43108	43108	Tarzan	188	” Reese said . Tag chuckled good - naturedly , much in the way he approached life . “
43148	43152	43142	43142	I	0	” He winked . “
43163	43180	43142	43142	I	0	”Six months to be exact . But she did n’t say that . Instead she said , “
43190	43199	43200	43200	Reese	101	Crane?”“Eli is serving overseas for another few years , ”
43203	43213	43200	43200	Reese	101	“ He ’s not one to come home often . ”“Eli
43219	43262	43200	43200	Reese	101	” Her voice sounded hollow . Reese had n’t mentioned his brother was in another country . Should n’t that have been on his short list of things to tell her ? Thank goodness she did n’t mention that to the media . “Marines
43264	43268	43200	43200	Reese	101	” Tag corrected . “
43275	43285	43272	43272	he	1080	” He looked around the room as if assessing . “
43298	43304	43305	43305	Merina	84	”“You mean tolerance for Chicago ? ”
43308	43314	43305	43305	Merina	84	“Tolerance for the hotel business . ”
43325	43335	43305	43305	Merina	84	“ Eli ’s sense of duty overwhelms everything else . ”“He
43344	43356	43317	43317	Tag	109	” Reese said , and she could tell he meant it . “
43367	43376	43377	43377	Tag	109	”“Have Big Crane show you his tats sometime , ”
43388	43400	43377	43377	Tag	109	“ Brother . I ’m off . I have a date . ”“Should’ve
43404	43416	43377	43377	Tag	109	” Reese ’s tone was teasing . Tag smiled in challenge . “Never
43428	43434	43435	43435	Sis	190	” Tag nodded at Merina . “
43441	43465	43470	43470	his	1086	”Sis . Merina blinked as Tag turned , tall and broad and , yes , like Tarzan but with a much better vocabulary . “He
43478	43496	43474	43474	I	0	” she said to Reese . He did n’t answer , which was an answer in itself . “Everyone
43498	43552	43474	43474	I	0	” Reese announced . He had n’t lifted his voice much , but the crowd stopped and turned to him the moment he spoke . Reese had a commanding nature . He was someone who drew attention . His palm covered her lower back and warmth transferred from his hand to her skin . “I’ll
43561	43567	43568	43568	Tilly	178	” he told their guests . “
43598	43605	43613	43613	my	0	”Low murmurs came from the crowd . “A
43608	43612	43613	43613	my	0	” she asked . “On
43625	43629	43613	43613	my	0	” Reese said . “
43655	43803	43613	43613	my	0	”They headed out of the room , Reese accepting handshakes and Merina narrowly avoiding a cheek kiss from Dice . Then they walked upstairs hand - in - hand , winding around hallways until Reese came to a stop in front of a door . Her basic necessities had been moved in yesterday , and unloaded into his room . Their shared room . The door they stood outside of now . He opened the door , revealing the room she ’d seen yesterday when she was putting her clothes and her shoes in one of the closets . Hers was the gargantuan one on the right side of the room , Reese ’s on the left . She ’d fit her dresser , a mirror , and an entire wall of shoes in there . It was almost too much . But then , was n’t this all?“The
43810	43828	43857	43857	He	1092	” She ’d walked in ahead of him and turned to find him undoing his cuff links . “I
43844	43851	43857	43857	He	1092	”“Privacy to make it look like … ”
43862	43876	43857	43857	He	1092	“ Then we ’ll return to work and life goes back to normal . ”Normal
43920	43932	43933	43933	He	1092	“The bonus is on the boat — it’ll just be us . ”
43954	43966	43933	43933	He	1092	“ So you wo n’t have to do anything for show . ”“No
43969	43990	43992	43993	first mate	1101	” She had to clear her throat to get the question out when he untied the length of black silk . “Captain
44001	44073	43992	43993	first mate	1101	” Reese left the bow tie dangling and lost the jacket , tossing it haphazardly onto the massive bed . Four fat posts and piles of gold and black bedding stood at the end of the room . Would they share that bed ? She assumed they ’d have to . The house staff would be suspicious if they didn’t . He crooked a finger for her to come to him . “What
44075	44088	43992	43993	first mate	1101	” It took everything in her not to take a step backward . “What
44100	44266	44095	44095	I	0	”Oh . Okay , she was being ridiculous . Crane was n’t trying to seduce her . Not even in this luxurious den of sin . That ’s how she saw it , with its dark wood flooring and rich cedar closets . A bed they could do cartwheels on , Reese ’s obvious kissing abilities … Yeah , it had n’t taken long for her mind to cannonball into the gutter . She sashayed — because there was no other way to walk in her floor - length lace - and - satin gown — and turned , having no need to hold her hair up since it was pinned at her nape . Warm fingers brushed there now as he undid the delicate pearl button at the top , then ran his fingers down her bare back before sliding the zipper down . He took his time , pausing at each inch . Her heart thudded as Reese sucked in a deep breath . “You’re
44272	44306	44307	44307	you	1102	” His low , gravel - laden voice matched her lust - filled thoughts . Being kissed by him was distracting to the nth degree , but being undressed by him ? Unparalleled . “Thank
44309	44345	44307	44307	you	1102	” she managed . With the flat of one hand , he touched her shoulder , leaning so close , she could feel the brush of his shirt and the heat radiating off his body . “
44347	44349	44616	44616	Merina	84	I?”“Crane … ”“The
44358	44436	44616	44616	Merina	84	” Those words were murmured against the shell of her ear before he closed his lips over the edge of her lobe . He was a drug . Her eyes fell closed as she gave herself over to the sensation of Reese ’s broad palms sliding over the bared skin of her back . His fingers tucked beneath the thin flower - laced straps of the dress , then molded her shoulders , pulling those straps down . “You’re
44440	44611	44616	44616	Merina	84	” His voice was filled with wonder . He placed another kiss to her neck . She did n’t know what to do with her hands . They were currently pressed to the front of her gown when what she wanted to do was strip herself bare and turn to accept Reese ’s mouth on every part of her . But she could n’t do that . Selling part of her soul for the Van Heusen did n’t include her body . Snapping out of her trance , she turned abruptly and found Reese ’s eyes full of lust and his pants tenting impressively . She wanted to tell him this was n’t part of the deal . That she was n’t going to consummate their fake marriage , but her mouth was dry and her mind busy imagining what his bare chest looked and tasted like , so no words came out . She simply stood , holding her dress to her breasts , where his eyes currently rested . “No
44623	44635	44616	44616	Merina	84	” He looked scary serious , which she did n’t like . “No
44638	44645	44616	44616	Merina	84	”The corner of his mouth lifted . “
44649	44665	44616	44616	Merina	84	”As much as she wanted to turn and run to her closet , she didn’t . “Someday
44667	44685	44687	44687	you	84	” he said , lifting a finger and drawing it over the swell of her right breast , “
44721	44725	44730	44730	him	1104	”“My … tattoo ? ”
44752	44758	44774	44774	he	1104	“ When you ’re ready . ”Before
44882	44884	44885	44885	she	84	“Luna , ”
44888	44892	44885	44885	she	84	“ Like moon ? ”
44959	44964	44930	44930	He	1104	“Named after my mother . ”“Oh
44966	44975	44930	44930	He	1104	” His raw openness took her by surprise . “
44982	45064	44930	44930	He	1104	”Reese was quiet save for their footfalls on the wooden dock . He helped her board Luna and she could n’t help thinking she ’d left one mansion and climbed onto another . Pristine white and black and gold — Reese ’s dominant color scheme she was seeing — on the outside and more of the same inside . She entered a lush living room that gave way to an expansive kitchen . A corridor to the left featured more rooms . “Master
45072	45083	44930	44930	He	1104	” he said as he closed the door behind them . “
45096	45112	44930	44930	He	1104	”Wow . The massive space had shrunk by half with his heat blanketing her back . “I
45120	45124	44930	44930	He	1104	” she said . “You’re
45129	45153	44930	44930	He	1104	” he stated , edging by her for the kitchen . He opened a cabinet and came out with a bottle of liquor . “
45162	45173	44930	44930	He	1104	” He gestured around the room at the tinted glass . “
45212	45225	45278	45278	his	1119	”No matter what they did . Did n’t that just introduce multiple inappropriate thoughts?“Your
45234	45249	45278	45278	his	1119	” he said , pouring a few inches of the liquor into a glass . “
45250	45259	45263	45263	his	1119	Scotch?”“Seriously , I can take the smaller room . ”He
45307	45313	45314	45314	he	1119	“I do n’t sleep much , ”
45317	45323	45314	45314	he	1119	“Something we have in common . ”
45356	45361	45362	45362	she	1120	“ I prefer Glenlivet , ”
45413	45430	45431	45431	yourself	1121	“Mind if I use the bathroom first ? My mascara is starting to feel like flypaper . ”“Help
45449	45457	45431	45431	yourself	1121	”She nodded and turned to the corridor . “Merina?”She
45486	45501	45470	45470	she	1120	“Penelope suggested we take in the sunrise on the deck . For potential photographers . ”“Oh
45508	45519	45470	45470	she	1120	” Sunrise with Reese Crane on his yacht . Was she dreaming?“I’ll
45523	45710	45470	45470	she	1120	”His warm promise followed her all the way into her bedroom . * * * Morning came , and for all the sleep she ’d gotten , she may as well have stayed awake the entire night . She ’d watched out the bedroom window at the waves left in the wake of Luna , while thinking through the day . She was married . Reese Crane ’s wife . Her diamond ring had glittered in the moonlight that made its way through the windows , making her consider what the future would be like . What life would look like when she divorced and went back home to live with her parents . Wait , no . She did n’t have to move back in with them . She could move out into that apartment like she wanted . She ’d make a clean , guilt - free break , and she ’d have plenty of money saved , given she was n’t paying rent any longer . She’d finally fallen asleep for a few hours and woke to a light tap on her door . “Merina
45719	45724	45725	45725	she	1126	text?”“I’ll be right out , ”
45875	45885	45886	45886	she	1126	“Really going to have to rough it until then , ”
46151	46152	46114	46114	Reese	101	“ Ready?”“Um
46154	46178	46114	46114	Reese	101	” Words . She could n’t call up enough to string into a sentence , so she went with a slightly coherent reply . “
46183	46224	46114	46114	Reese	101	”With a nod , he reached past her and snagged the fluffy comforter from the bed , rolling it into a big ball . Then he took her hand — cold — in his — insanely warm — and said , “
46232	46311	46312	46313	my God	2242	”Emerging from the softly lit cabin of the boat to the dark , frigid wind on the deck made her suck air through her teeth . She considered dashing back to bed — after she snatched that heavenly blanket from Reese ’s arms — but seeing as this was their first appearance as a married couple , fleeing his presence the morning after would n’t be well received . Still , she could n’t help voicing a complaint . “Oh
46321	46329	46114	46114	Reese	101	” she said , her teeth chattering . “Worth
46335	46371	46332	46332	I	0	” Wind kicked his hair . He looked almost rugged with the overgrown stubble and those casual clothes . Like him , but a homier him . She ’d never really thought of Reese Crane as “
46374	46388	46389	46389	he	1135	”“When was the last time you took in a sunrise on a yacht ? ”
46397	46399	46389	46389	he	1135	“Never . You?”“The
46407	46423	46402	46402	I	0	” His mouth quirked and she had no idea if he was joking or not . “Really?”“Really
46437	46451	46452	46452	you	0	” He spread the blanket over a bench facing the water and sat . “Were
46457	46465	46389	46389	he	1135	” She ’d had about a million . “Come
46469	46541	46589	46589	you	1138	” he said instead of answering her . He held the blanket out like a cape and obeying his request , she sat next to him . He rerouted her , lifting her onto his lap , then closed the blanket over her . She snuggled into his heat , moving until she was comfortable . He grunted when she bumped his — ahem — man part a little too aggressively . “Sorry
46543	46574	46589	46589	you	1138	” This time , her wiggle was met with his palms closing over her waist . He turned her to the side where her hip met several inches of steel . “Hold
46577	46587	46589	46589	you	1138	” he said , his voice just as hard . “
46593	46626	46589	46589	you	1138	”She bit back a smile . Not because him being turned on was funny , but because she could n’t remember the last time she ’d had that effect on a man . “Laugh
46630	46641	46589	46589	you	1138	” he encouraged , one hand moving up her leg . “It
46654	46660	46661	46661	he	1139	”“It ’s a human reaction , ”
46697	46700	46680	46680	he	1139	“ human reactions ”
46711	46718	46719	46719	he	1139	“We’re supposed to look in love , ”
46723	46733	46735	46735	herself	1138	“ Consider this my effort to help that along . ”She
46769	46773	46774	46774	he	1139	“That ’s better , ”
46853	46856	46857	46857	She	1138	“Thick hair . ”
46898	46903	46904	46904	she	1138	“ No gray yet , ”
46907	46917	46904	46904	she	1138	“ Surprising since your father has a head full . ”Unwavering
47010	47013	47014	47014	she	1138	“Chest hair , ”
47020	47025	47014	47014	she	1138	“ I like that . ”“Do
47028	47101	47014	47014	she	1138	” He tightened his arms around her . It was n’t a question , but she nodded anyway . The sun peeked over the water , casting golden light over his face , but neither of them looked away from each other to take in the morning making its grand entrance . Reese ’s hand came out from under the blanket and cupped her neck , pulling her mouth close to his . “So
47105	47112	47014	47014	she	1138	” he whispered against his lips . “
47121	47124	47125	47125	Her	1138	”“Not ever ? ”
47144	47146	47172	47172	Reese	101	“Never . ”She
47301	47303	47304	47304	She	1138	“Honey . ”
47309	47315	47304	47304	She	1138	“ You look … flushed . ”He
47339	47344	47345	47345	he	1139	“That should do it , ”
47348	47349	47345	47345	he	1139	“Do what?”“Give
47356	47395	47345	47345	he	1139	” He moved her hand from his face and kissed her palm , but it was a flat kiss , his expression equally so . He shifted out from under her and stood . She did n’t like this “
47399	47420	47326	47326	his	1139	” guy . She liked rumpled , sexy , kissing guy . She liked couldn’t - control - himself guy . “I’m
47428	47731	47326	47326	his	1139	” A twitch of his lips did n’t give way to a real smile before he vanished belowdecks . Picturing him in the shower without anything on sent a flood of warmth to her belly . Reese had lost control with her and he did n’t like it . She pressed her fingertips to her lips to smother a smile . She liked it . Too much . * * * Reese rested his fingertips on the blotter of his desk , nostrils flared , his mind a tangle of silken skin and sex and hot kisses that stole the breath from his very lungs . Only two of which he ’d sampled this past weekend . He’d spent a total of two days aboard Luna , but after the sunrise that accompanied his dick - rise , he ’d spent a lot of time avoiding his wife . He ’d returned to the deck with coffee for each of them , his body under its best behavior . He could n’t afford to let go of his control . There was too much at stake . Crane Hotels . CEO . His legacy . The position he was born and bred and groomed to take . He would n’t lose it over an attraction of convenience . She ’s more than convenient and you know it . Merina was a long game : lasting months , not one night . The attraction between them was as volatile and unstoppable as a brush fire in California ’s dry season . Dangerous . He frowned . As of this morning , he could take solace in the fact that their ruse did its job . A gossip column in the local paper had offered up photos of spring in Chicago . A section called “
47737	47813	47326	47326	his	1139	” featuring budding trees and flowers and a photo of Reese and Merina ’s sunrise kiss . The shot was from too far back to see much more than their faces pressed together aboard Luna . But the headline was key and what had Penelope phoning him first thing this morning to punch the air in triumph . REESE ’S ROCKET UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!To be fair , he may have felt less homicidal today if his “
47815	47822	47881	47881	she	0	” had been well tended to . “No
47830	47851	47881	47881	she	0	” he answered Bobbie , who was standing in front of his desk jotting things onto a pad of paper . “
47864	47868	47869	47869	She	0	”“Yes , sir . ”
48020	48022	48016	48016	he	1148	“ home ”
48190	48200	48201	48201	Reese	101	“Would it kill you to wear a fucking suit ? ”
48227	48257	48271	48271	him	109	“ Bro . You have got to find a way to work off this sexual energy or everyone is going to know the truth in a day or two . ”Reese
48273	48277	48271	48271	him	109	“ Is it that obvious?”“Yes
48279	48281	48271	48271	him	109	”Dammit . “You
48290	48329	48285	48285	Wolverine	197	”Reese took in his posture , hunching over his desk , fingernails white from the amount of pressure he was applying . He was strung tight . He stood , rolled his shoulders , and cracked his neck . “Guess
48340	48421	48285	48285	Wolverine	197	” Tag observed , coming to the guest chair and plunking into it . A half - smile suggested he was kidding , but Reese did n’t find it funny . The only woman he could picture beneath him , legs spread , back arched , face flushed as he drove into her , the air filled with her moans of pleasure , was Merina . What horrible irony that he ’d married the one woman he could n’t fuck . “I
48428	48444	48285	48285	Wolverine	197	” Tag pointed out , because he was being oh - so - helpful today . “It
48448	48454	48459	48459	he	109	”“No , it ’s not . ”Reese
48470	48480	48464	48464	He	109	“ Fine . What is it ? Enlighten me . ”“You
48492	48502	48464	48464	He	109	” his brother answered matter - of - factly . “And
48504	48513	48464	48464	He	109	” But Reese knew where this was going . “And
48581	48607	48573	48573	you	1168	”Hayes . The second - to - last person Reese wanted to think about was his ex - best friend . The first being Gwyneth . “Ancient
48610	48656	48573	48573	you	1168	” Reese said . The mention of their names sent a wave of regret through him , but most of that sting was because he ’d been taken advantage of — had allowed himself to be taken advantage of — and had n’t stopped it . “
48669	48698	48699	48699	she	1167	” Or less . Maybe the board could be wooed before then and they could divorce before his dick shriveled and dropped off . He repressed a shudder . “Is
48701	48703	48810	48810	she	1167	cooperating?”If by “
48706	48711	48810	48810	she	1167	” Tag meant she was “
48718	48802	48810	48810	she	1167	” he was spot - on . Like Reese , Tag dated often , only when Tag dumped his date it was n’t with a curt conversation and delivered flowers . Tag did it with a wink , a smile , and a playful bump on the jaw , and the line that worked best for him : Let ’s save ourselves the trouble . The blow - off matched his easygoing attitude , so girls most often left with a matching smile . “Meaning
48804	48808	48810	48810	she	1167	” Reese asked . “Meaning
48825	48835	48810	48810	she	1167	” He wiggled his fingers in front of him . “
48852	48859	48810	48810	she	1167	” He shook his head curtly . “
48866	48871	48810	48810	she	1167	”Hmm . Great point . “We’ll
48874	48889	48890	48890	Tag	109	”“I did n’t come in here to razz you , believe it or not , ”
48893	48926	48890	48890	Tag	109	“ I wanted to suggest you come with me to play racquetball . Burn off some of your rage before you climb this building and start swiping at low - flying planes . ”“Racquetball
48928	48959	48890	48890	Tag	109	” The idea of pounding a little blue ball into the wall sounded like a great way to forget about his own pair . At least for a few hours . “
48964	48969	48970	48970	Tag	109	”“Was that a yes ? ”
48985	48992	48993	48993	Reese	101	“Don’t make me change my mind , ”
49257	49259	49260	49260	Merina	84	“Magda , ”
49276	49280	49281	49281	Magda	176	“Mrs . Crane . ”
49288	49305	49281	49281	Magda	176	“ Late night for you . Were you able to work the gate and the garage door okay?”“Yes
49321	49327	49328	49328	She	84	”“Thank you for saying so . ”
49337	49363	49328	49328	She	84	“ Your dinner is in the oven . Tamales , or if you do n’t care for those , a small tray of spinach lasagna . ”Yum
49365	49370	49371	49371	Merina	84	“I’ll probably have both , ”
49423	49429	49473	49474	Mrs. Crane	101	“Good night , Mrs. Crane . ”“Good
49432	49469	49473	49474	Mrs. Crane	101	”Magda left via the open garage door and Merina punched the button to close it . She ended up opening the wrong garage doors twice before figuring out what buttons to push to close them again . “Pull
49476	49540	49473	49474	Mrs. Crane	101	” she chided herself as she walked inside . She set the alarm code on the door and strolled through the kitchen , the smells as tantalizing as promised . And , as she ’d promised Magda , she sat down to a healthy portion of both lasagna and tamales before rinsing her dish and fork and depositing them into the empty dishwasher . “For
49551	49686	49545	49545	I	0	” She ’d been trying to be funny , but it was n’t so funny when she got turned around in the staircase that led from the kitchen to the opposite side of the house , and then in attempting to reroute to the other hallway , ended up in an upstairs office instead . Tall , rich mahogany shelves lined the walls , books clogging them . An arched window faced the lake , taking up half the wall . A desk dominated the space , and the man facing the window dominated the desk . She could n’t see Reese ’s face , just the back of his head , chair turned , hand propping up his head . She had no idea if he ’d heard her approach until he spoke . “Evening
49688	49707	49709	49709	you	1190	”“I’m lost . I was on my way to the bedroom and made a wrong turn in Albuquerque . ”“How
49717	49801	49709	49709	you	1190	” He turned , dropping his elbow and facing her . He was in his signature dark suit , this one with a subtle pinstripe design visible thanks to the moonlight , and his tie knot had been loosened , his top button opened . His scruff was short , his hair perfectly styled , and that crooked tie was about the sexiest thing she ’d ever seen him wear . It bespoke of his loss of control , and she was quickly learning “
49803	49811	49545	49545	I	0	” was the way she preferred him . “So
49816	49864	49709	49709	you	1190	” She walked to the desk and Reese ’s eyes dropped to her feet before skimming up her pencil skirt and lingering at her silk shirt . That ’s when she remembered his comment about her tattoo . Was that why his eyes so often strayed to her chest?“I
49877	49910	50015	50015	she	1192	” She liked his dry sense of humor , but beneath it was another emotion . One she could n’t place . He wrenched his eyes to hers when she came closer . “You
49921	49964	49919	49919	you	1190	” she asked , her voice husky . He rested his palms on his suit pants , fingers splayed , chin up as he kept his gaze fused with hers . He did . She could feel that need vibrating from him . “You
49969	49987	49919	49919	you	1190	” She fingered a delicate button on her shirt and watched his fingertips dig into his legs . “
49993	50000	50052	50052	she	1192	”“I’ll be the judge of that . ”
50043	50051	50052	50052	she	1192	“You’re going to kind of get flashed , ”
50365	50368	50369	50369	he	1190	“Fuck it , ”
50379	50382	50383	50383	she	84	“Fuck what ? ”
50386	50399	50383	50383	she	84	“Fuck you . Preferably on this desk . Preferably two minutes ago . ”
50480	50482	50483	50483	he	1190	“Futile , ”
50495	50498	50483	50483	he	1190	“What is ? ”
50521	50523	50524	50524	He	1190	“Resistance . ”
50602	50611	50612	50612	she	84	“I ca n’t wait to take this off , ”
50642	50643	50645	50645	you	1190	“The tie?”“I
50658	50666	50652	50652	you	1190	” She slipped the silk knot loose . “
50671	50833	50652	50652	you	1190	” She flattened her hands on his chest and pushed . He sat obediently , which was new . If she were any other woman , he ’d have had her completely nude and spread across his desk before his tie was off . He preferred control . With Merina , he ’d become insatiably curious . He was willing to give in to her for the moment , if only to satisfy his lingering curiosity . She reached behind her to unhook her black lace bra , pushing her breasts out . He admired the swells , the mystery tattoo . Delicate but aggressive , the flames licking across her chest . Then she unzipped her slim skirt and shimmied out of it — taking her time until the material fell to her feet . She left her tall black heels on , which saved him stopping her from taking them off . She was just how he wanted her . “Ready
50835	50854	50881	50881	he	1201	” He reached for her hips and her eyes widened , her chest lifting with each hectic breath . “For?”His
50893	50895	50881	50881	he	1201	“Oh ! ”
50931	50933	50911	50911	he	1201	“Oh . ”
50944	50951	50952	50952	She	1200	“Do you like this , Merina ? ”
50960	50966	50967	50967	Her	1200	“ What ’s your pleasure ? ”
50996	51001	51002	51002	She	1200	“What do you think ? ”
51088	51090	51079	51079	He	1201	“Condom ? ”
51111	51118	51119	51119	He	1201	“Not until we find the bedroom . ”
51210	51212	51213	51213	He	1201	“Vixen . ”
51245	51249	51254	51254	Merina	84	“ Follow me . ”Several
51292	51295	51296	51296	he	1201	“Something funny ? ”
51322	51333	51334	51334	She	84	“You mean besides you getting lost in your own house ? ”
51337	51340	51343	51343	she	84	“Your mouth . ”Lips
51346	51350	51343	51343	she	84	“ What about my mouth?”He
51365	51378	51343	51343	she	84	“ I can think of better ways to put it to use . ”Her
51394	51402	51403	51403	He	1201	“ We ’re close . Trust me . ”
51408	51413	51414	51414	she	84	“You need a bloodhound , ”
51422	51424	51414	51414	she	84	“Merina . ”
51467	51470	51451	51451	he	1201	anyway?“You have two kitchens?”“Apparently
51472	51565	51451	51451	he	1201	” He blinked around at the smaller kitchen area , which , of course , he knew he had . Then he tightened his hold on Merina ’s hand and dragged her with him , picking up the pace as her laughter echoed through another open , empty room . The moment they passed a downstairs bedroom , the one overlooking the pool , he had his bearings . But those bearings had come with a memory of the last time he ’d set foot in that room . Five years ago … “I’m
51581	51651	51695	51695	Gwyneth	153	” Reese shouted as Gwyneth tossed her clothes from the closet to the bed . She was sobbing and part of him wanted to go to her . He refused . He was the one whose world had been torn to shreds . He was the one who had been betrayed . It was Gwyneth who chose to take their four years together and throw them into the incinerator . “You’re
51655	51667	51695	51695	Gwyneth	153	” She pointed at him with a dress on a hanger . “Me
51669	51692	51693	51693	Hayes	154	” He stepped back into their shared bedroom , the one overlooking the pool because she liked to swim in the morning . “
51697	51710	51693	51693	Hayes	154	” His voice rose , but pain had eked into his tone . “
51727	51795	51723	51723	you	153	Lerner?”Her lip trembled but he did n’t let himself care what she was feeling . He could n’t . If he gave her an opening , she ’d talk her way back into his life and he could n’t afford to be this wrong . Not ever again . Whatever she was going through paled in comparison to the earthquake now splitting his entire being in two . “Anyone
51797	52281	51723	51723	you	153	” His voice cracked and he forced down a lump of misery . He would not let her see him wounded . He would come back from this . When he did , she and Hayes could fuck in public for all he cared . The problem was that right now , he did care . Later that night , when he escaped to Crane Hotel and the uppermost suite on the same floor as his office , he realized the mistake that had been made was his . He’d watched his father after his mother died . Watched him wall up and move forward . Alex ’s mind was on his business , his sights honed in on profits , numbers , and facts . Things that could be measured and quantified . Things that could be counted and delegated . Alex marched onward for a decade after losing Lunette , and in the process Reese had learned an invaluable lesson . Women were not for keeps . His mother ’s death had left all her boys unprepared . Scrambling . When fifteen - year - old Reese would have collapsed under the weight of grief , when Eli , just a year younger , would have beat the shit out of every kid in school for fun , and when Tag , at the tender age of eleven would have hidden from the world instead of cashing in on his big personality , Alex had stepped up and done what his family needed . He’d soldiered on . They did n’t call the man Big Crane for nothing . Yes , he was in charge , but it also took a big man to move past what would have put a lesser man in the grave alongside his wife . Reese knew that lesson but temporarily forgot it over what amounted to a pair of great tits and a swish of strawberry hair . Gwyneth had made him forget his purpose . Forget his priorities . Heartbreak was his payment , and he ’d earned every shattered piece . With it came the reinforcement of that long - ago learned lesson . Women were n’t for keeps . Women did n’t stay . That night , he made a decision . Focus on building his future on something tangible , something that would n’t go anywhere . Crane Hotels . Alex would retire in the next five or ten years and the board would be looking to appoint one of his sons the new CEO . Big shoes to fill , but Reese had big feet . He was going to be the one , and he would n’t let a woman stand in his way . Not ever again . Merina ’s aerated laughter cut into his thoughts the moment Reese opened a door and ushered them into the foyer . “Thank
52284	52292	51723	51723	you	153	” Merina said , dropping his hand . “
52304	52406	51723	51723	you	153	”He turned and found her smiling , her shirt buttoned wrong , the edge of her tattoo peeking out . She was tempting and made him want to bury his bad memories in every inch of her smooth skin . To forget what had happened long ago and take the reprieve . But his body had grown cold at the memory that had assaulted him , and he would n’t be put in a position of explaining it to Merina . Whiskey could be his bedmate tonight . It worked almost as well as sex to help him forget the past . “You
52417	52428	51723	51723	you	153	” he muttered , taking a step away from her . “I
52431	52444	52414	52414	I	0	” She cocked her head inquisitively , sensing the change in him . “Then
52448	52467	52414	52414	I	0	” Moonbeams sliced across the foyer , and he backed from the light into the shadow of the kitchen .
52854	52861	52862	52862	she	84	“Well . Look who ’s up , ”
52942	52945	52946	52946	he	1216	“Good morning , ”
52955	52982	52983	52983	She	84	“My bed was lonely . Care to share where you spent last night ? Here at the table ? On your yacht ? Or did you … ”
53054	53059	53060	53060	he	1216	“I’m sorry , darling , ”
53067	53084	53085	53085	He	1216	“ I ended up working until almost four in the morning and slept in the office . ”
53097	53113	53085	53085	He	1216	“ You were so exhausted last night , I did n’t want to wake you . ”Her
53194	53195	53188	53188	He	1216	“ Cream?”Apparently
53208	53211	53212	53212	she	84	“Not today , ”
53230	53239	53240	53240	he	1216	“Keeping me on my toes , I see , ”
53272	53279	53280	53280	he	1216	all?“Can I drop you at work ? ”
53297	53302	53303	53303	she	84	“I’d prefer to drive , ”
53315	53324	53303	53303	she	84	“All right , then . See you tonight . ”
53343	53349	53339	53339	he	1216	“ have a nice day . ”Mug
53475	53480	53481	53481	he	1216	“ I trust her , ”
53485	53499	53481	53481	he	1216	“ but I do want to give her the benefit of plausible deniability . ”Reese
53747	53757	53758	53758	he	1216	“Dad ’s party will require a bit of acting , ”
53766	53773	53758	53758	he	1216	“On your part , you mean ? ”
53856	53860	53861	53861	he	1216	“Both our parts , ”
53864	53881	53861	53861	he	1216	“ Lately we ’ve been distant . Understandable , seeing as how busy we ’ve been . ”“Busy
53883	53891	53892	53892	You	1216	” She let out a sharp laugh . “
53906	53965	53892	53892	You	1216	” She pressed her lips together before she said too much . The last thing she needed was for him to know how she felt . In the race for control , she needed to hold on to as much as possible . Reese was a predator , and she refused to be the wounded , weaker prey . “We
53973	53982	53892	53892	You	1216	” he said , seeing right through her . “Who
53985	54018	53892	53892	You	1216	” she asked , dropping her fork . Reese sent her a blank look that pissed her right off . How inconvenient he had to live with a woman who demanded they have “
54020	54023	53892	53892	You	1216	” feelings and “
54025	54042	53892	53892	You	1216	” conversations . How silly of her , expecting to be treated like a human being . “It
54050	54058	54047	54047	I	0	” he said while she silently fumed . “
54088	54099	54085	54085	you	1265	” he asked when she pushed away from the table . “I’m
54102	54607	54608	54608	I	0	” she clipped , feeling a swell of emotion hit her like an anvil . She had to get out of here before he saw her cry . She darted from the dining room and ran up the stairs , trying to quell the tears that burned the backs of her eyes . She was so damn lonely she could n’t stand it . No more morning coffees with her mother , no more late - night chats when she returned home and found her father waiting by the television . She even missed talking to Arnold at the desk when she worked late at the Van Heusen . When she was at work , she was busy , and when she was out to dinner with Reese , she could n’t completely be herself , and when she was here in the house , she was alone . Even with him in the same room , she felt utterly alone . In the bedroom ’s en suite , she stripped out of her work clothes and stepped into a hot shower , allowing the tears to come as she softly sobbed under the water . When she ’d met Corbin , he was attentive and fun and always smiling . He was complimentary and , yes , completely and utterly immature . But he ’d filled an emotional need she ’d been trying to ignore since he split with everything she had in her bank account . Since then , she ’d stayed busy , occasionally dating and being she - woman , able to handle her job , work overtime , and date the occasional underwhelming prospect . But today , just weeks into her marriage , Merina was exceptionally fragile . She could n’t be she - woman today . She just wanted to be a woman . She wanted to be vulnerable and open and emotional and unreasonable . She wanted someone to hold her while she was all of those things . But there was no one . * * * He gave Merina a few minutes before following in the direction she ’d disappeared . When he reached their bedroom and heard the shower on , he started to retreat . Until he picked out another sound beneath the pounding water . Crying . Soft , tender sobs he could tell she was trying to hide . Trying to stop . And they absolutely froze him in his tracks . He had n’t taken her emotions into consideration since the night he ran from his past demons . He ’d walled up , closed in , focused on work , and figured she was doing the same . But Merina was n’t like him . That was her most beautiful attribute . She was led by her heart , not her sense of duty and business . He ’d held the Van Heusen over her head , but it was ultimately her caring nature that had made her say “
54611	55079	55081	55081	you	1266	” He ’d taken that good faith , and the real connection they ’d forged , then frozen it solid . Part of which pissed him off — he was n’t good for her , good for anyone , and she should avoid getting involved with him any more than necessary . He ’d lost control in that darkened office when he kissed her , but vowed not to go there again . He respected her enough to leave her alone . His chest crumpled as another soft sob came from the other room . Not the staged cries of his ex , who would have turned on the waterworks to gain sympathy or her way , but real , soul - rending sadness Merina was desperately trying to hide . Maybe she did n’t want to be alone . He hovered in the middle of the room , unsure what to do next . Indecision in general made him uncomfortable . Rarely did he not know the next step . Silently , he turned over his options . Leave her to herself or wait for her to come out . The latter would risk her lashing out , but he was n’t that big of a dick that he did n’t realize this was his fault , at least in part . The man in him who was used to delegating the messy emotions of his past relationships wanted the latter . He was embarrassingly bad at these sorts of things , and it showed . But the husband in him knew he ’d hurt her and wanted her to be okay . That , he would n’t run away from . Even though he had no idea what the fuck he ’d say when she same out , he took off his suit jacket , rested it over the arm of the couch , sat , and waited . He did n’t have to wait long . Within a few minutes , the water shut off , and a few minutes after that , Merina exited the bathroom , a white towel wrapped around her body . His eyes went to the tattoo peeking out over one covered breast , the arrow whose meaning he did n’t know . Her shoulders were beaded with water droplets from her damp hair , the golden hue darker because it was wet . Her red - rimmed eyes went wide , surprised to see him , no doubt . He felt a physical pain he did n’t know what to do with in the vicinity of his heart . In the minutes he sat here , he had n’t thought of how to start the conversation . Turned out there was no need , because she spoke first . “What
55086	55215	55216	55216	you	1267	” Her anger snapped into place . He knew the diversion well , since he often used anger to mask his true feelings . She wanted him to believe that ’s all this was , her being upset because he was an ass . His instincts told him this was deeper than that . More complicated than that . Exactly what he ’d been running from for two weeks — technically for five years . But Merina was n’t Gwyneth , and if he thought for a second he could handle Merina the same way , he was a bigger idiot than she thought he was . He did n’t answer , knowing his words would n’t be heard , so instead he followed her to her closet . “Do
55219	55231	55216	55216	you	1267	” She spun on him , anger flashing in her eyes . “We
55237	55255	55258	55258	you	1267	” he started , but the words felt wrong . A second later he learned they were . “Oh
55265	55297	55258	55258	you	1267	” She opened a drawer and rifled through the pile of lace and silk panties . One hand holding the towel over her breasts , she shook black lace at him . “
55307	55312	55258	55258	you	1267	” Her cheeks reddened . “
55345	55356	55365	55365	she	0	on?”“Are you forgetting the purpose of this marriage , Merina ? ”
55415	55436	55437	55437	He	1267	“You endure me until I ’m named CEO and receive the Van Heusen in return . Is it so hard ? ”
55452	55480	55482	55482	she	0	“It ’s occurring to me I did n’t negotiate enough into my end of the deal , Crane . Enduring you is more difficult than I anticipated . ”The
55525	55537	55510	55510	she	0	“Don’t worry about my feelings , Merina . I have none . ”
55554	55564	55565	55565	He	1267	“ Tell me again how hard your life is . ”
55577	55624	55567	55567	his	1267	“ Your meals are made . You can sleep in any one of ten bedrooms . Your food is prepared by someone else , your messes cleaned for you . You have access to a yacht and a spending account to do with as you please . ”“Is
55630	55668	55567	55567	his	1267	” she snapped . He did n’t acknowledge her interruption . He ’d worked hard for what he had — what he was practically handing her — and refused to let her off the hook so easily . “At
55676	55681	55567	55567	his	1267	” he bit out , “
55705	55744	55567	55567	his	1267	” He had n’t pegged her for a gold digger but damn . What fucking else?She wrestled on her panties , her movements jerky , the towel slipping slightly and giving him a view of one luscious thigh . “What
55749	55760	55567	55567	his	1267	” she grumbled , her voice wavering the slightest bit . “
55773	55783	55567	55567	his	1267	” She speared him with those red eyes again . “That
55788	55792	55567	55567	his	1267	” he answered . “What
55796	55811	55812	55812	Emotional	203	” Her eyebrows lifted and dropped . She took a step closer to him . “
55813	55821	55812	55812	Emotional	203	connection?”Cold sweat prickled along his shirt collar . “Sex
55837	55921	55972	55972	she	1277	” With each example , she came closer . Until she was standing in front of him , chin elevated , holding his eyes unwavering . Closeness . If there was one thing he was not capable of giving , it was friendship . He ’d buy her the moon . He ’d fuck her silly . But that kind of closeness was n’t up for grabs . Not even in exchange for the coveted CEO of Crane Hotels . Not for anything . “I’m
55925	55961	55972	55972	she	1277	” She retreated and wrestled into a T - shirt without flashing him , then dropped the towel , exposing her legs briefly before she jammed them into a pair of long , stretchy pants . “
55965	55968	55969	55969	he	1276	”“Never mind , ”
55977	55983	55969	55969	he	1276	“ Is that like fine ? ”
56020	56039	56040	56040	She	1277	“ I ’ll probably read a little , then call Lorelei . I need someone to talk to . ”
56051	56073	56040	56040	She	1277	“ Apparently that ’s not in my contract . Do I need to go elsewhere or will you be leaving this room soon?”Oh
56120	56122	56123	56123	she	1277	“Hey ! ”
56146	56157	56126	56126	He	1276	“ Who do you think you ’re talking to , Mrs. Crane?”Her
56182	56187	56188	56188	he	1276	“Will sex fix it ? ”
56199	56202	56203	56203	he	1276	“Will it ? ”
56206	56210	56211	56211	she	1277	“Of course not , ”
56321	56326	56327	56327	he	1276	“I made you cry , ”
56344	56346	56347	56347	she	1277	“Yes , ”
56350	56360	56347	56347	she	1277	“I do n’t like that I made you cry . ”“So
56367	56377	56347	56347	she	1277	” She laid the softest kiss on his mouth . “
56391	56398	56400	56400	I	0	”The hold on his libido slipped . “God
56404	56413	56347	56347	she	1277	” He tightened his grip on her ass . “Then
56417	56783	56347	56347	she	1277	” She fisted his shirt and dragged him closer . Seconds later , his tie was tossed aside , the buttons undone one by one . He continued moving his tongue against hers , tasting the salt from her tears and the heady , spicy flavor of her mouth . She smelled of shampoo and soap and all he wanted to do was bury his nose between her thighs and absolutely devour her . He did n’t know how to fix her hurts deep down , but he knew how to make her forget them for now . And so far , she was willing to concede that point . He’d take it . But this was n’t just for her . No , there was a selfish part of him that needed her to cover his deep hurts as well . Forget what led them to this point , what would be waiting for him when it was over . His need for her was unlike any he ’d felt before . He was a starving man , and she was his feast . * * * This is crazy . This is crazy . But the words were drowned by the pulsating demands of her body . Reese was turning her inside out . She needed what he was offering . She needed to be taken , kissed hard , held down , fucked until she was begging for it . Her emotions could n’t be trusted in his care , this she knew , but her body … her body was a different story . Reese Crane was an expert — knew exactly what a woman wanted , what a woman needed . She happened to be a wanting , needing woman . He lifted her shirt over her head , his talented mouth closing over her nipple . Her hands dug into his hair , anchoring herself to him . Where before she was filled with despair and loneliness , now she was filled with longing and anticipation . So much better . He reached between her legs and cupped her sex and let her nipple go with a subtle pop . “
56786	56788	56789	56789	she	1278	”“Wet , ”
56933	56940	56945	56945	him	1279	“Not yet , you do n’t . ”
56956	56961	56945	56945	him	1279	“ Wait for me . ”She
57035	57038	57044	57044	she	1278	“ Careful . ”She
57072	57076	57077	57077	she	1278	“Reese ’s rocket , ”
57095	57100	57083	57083	His	1279	“ In the flesh . ”His
57104	57114	57083	57083	His	1279	“ What am I going to do with you , Merina?”“I
57119	57258	57261	57261	Merina	84	”Proving he did , his mouth dropped to hers briefly , then he was up , peeling off his clothes and yanking open the nightstand drawer on the opposite side of the bed . Merina kicked out of her yoga pants , eyes on the gold foil packet between Reese ’s teeth . The promise of what was to come rattled her nerves and set her aflame . Maybe she was wrong earlier . Sex with him might fix everything after all . Panties off , she tossed them to the floor . Reese rolled the condom on , stroking himself once more , twice more . She bit down on her bottom lip , her eyes on those coveted inches wrapped in his strong fist . He depressed the bed with a knee and came to her . “Say
57263	57416	57261	57261	Merina	84	” Her name rolled off his tongue , his deep timbre seducing her ears . He parted her legs with one knee and settled between her thighs . At the same time the word yes hissed from between her teeth , he buried himself to the hilt . Every . Last . Inch . She crossed her ankles at his back , holding him close . With powerful thrusts he plunged into her again and again . This need had been vibrating between them for the last few weeks — hell , maybe the last month . The attraction between them had always an inferno they ’d tried futilely to keep from lighting . Pity . Because this was damn good . One hand at her lower back , he canted her hips and pushed into her again . Her eyelids slid shut as a moan of encouragement eked from her throat . “Finally
57418	57434	57446	57446	he	1281	” he said through labored breaths . Then he smiled , inordinately pleased with himself . “
57438	57441	57442	57442	she	1280	”“We’ll see , ”
57466	57473	57474	57474	he	1281	“Give it to me , Merina , ”
57483	57486	57474	57474	he	1281	“Not until … ”
57500	57504	57474	57474	he	1281	“ … you . ”“Ladies
57510	57731	57507	57507	I	0	” He drew out slowly before driving into her , and a sharp cry of pleasure came from her parted lips . They had sex the same way they fought , fighting to maintain control as long as possible . But just as the thought came that she would n’t let him win this battle , she surrendered . Another thrust and her back arched , an orgasm rocking her . He followed , surrendering with her , his groans of pleasure loud in her ears . Lights exploded behind her eyes and part of her registered that she was being loud . Which Reese probably ate up with a spoon . Egomaniac . Even that snide thought could n’t erase the buoyancy that overtook her chest , the pleasant blankness that covered her mind , the feeling of being a part of someone else — the closeness she ’d mentioned earlier . Seconds , minutes — hell , who knew how long — passed before she opened her eyes , feeling as if she ’d surfaced from a drugged haze . Reese was propped on his elbows over her , eyes hooded , breathing heavy . From inside her , his cock pulsed . She gave him a squeeze . It drew a smile to his brilliantly handsome face . “
57738	57750	57804	57805	Reese Crane	101	”She smiled back at him , unable to keep from it . “That”—he
57756	57761	57804	57805	Reese Crane	101	nose—“was a good idea . ”Merina
57835	57838	57839	57839	She	1282	“No bragging . ”
57852	57855	57847	57847	He	1283	“No need . ”
57873	57884	57870	57870	he	1283	“ Your body tells me everything I need to know . ”There
57922	57925	57926	57926	He	1283	“Don’t worry . ”
57929	57935	57926	57926	He	1283	“ I wo n’t tell . ”She
58021	58024	58003	58003	Alex	96	“ Subtle . ”“I
58030	58038	58003	58003	Alex	96	” Tag shrugged one massive shoulder . The “
58040	58114	58003	58003	Alex	96	” headline he was referring to was in a Chicago socialite magazine . Not exactly the Trib but anyone who cared about gossip paid attention to Elegant Elite . They were the ones who started photographing Reese with his dates at every charity and dinner function , and they ’d mentioned # ReesesRocket on their Twitter feed several times last week . The headline HONEYMOON ’S ON ! was definitely a step up . “It
58118	58123	58003	58003	Alex	96	” Alex told Reese . “Penelope
58134	58137	58003	58003	Alex	96	”Alex grunted . “Tomorrow
58144	58148	58003	58003	Alex	96	” Reese said . “
58154	58276	58149	58149	They	1288	” Reese did n’t think anyone would suspect he and Merina were anything but in love after they ’d blown each other ’s minds in bed last night . This morning had been as peaceful as monks . Shared orgasms had put some slack into the tension between them . Getting along behind the scenes was bound to make it easier to parade around in public . Always productive after sex , he ’d typically excuse himself to his office , but when he ’d come out of the bathroom , his wife had beat him to it . Merina was up , dressed in her stretchy pants and T - shirt again , and pulling on a pair of sneakers . “Thanks
58283	58288	58281	58281	Crane	101	” She ’d grinned . “
58296	58439	58441	58441	I	0	”Then she was off , wiggling her round , delicious ass away from him and into the office down the hall . He retreated to his own office but concentration was n’t as smooth as usual . Typically sex freed his brain and he could work , but last night , his mind kept returning to the wonder that was Merina ’s face during sex . The neat little pleat between her golden brown eyebrows . The parting of her pink mouth when she blew out a ragged breath of enjoyment . Her normally smooth , tamed hair a wild mess over the pillow , a few strands thrown over half her face while she writhed . Incredible . Fingers snapped in front of Reese ’s face and he blinked to see Tag ’s surly expression and their father standing to leave . “Anyway
58445	58458	58441	58441	I	0	” Alex declared . Only after he ’d gone did Tag speak . “You
58469	58474	58475	58475	Reese	101	”“She ’s my wife . ”
58506	58512	58501	58501	Tag	109	“Proud of you , Clip . ”
58576	58578	58579	58579	Tag	109	“Careful , ”
58582	58591	58579	58579	Tag	109	“ Girls get attached . They want more . ”“Thank
58616	58622	58624	58624	I	0	” Reese lifted an eyebrow . “Hey
58641	58648	58649	58649	Reese	101	”“Because he ’s focused on work , ”
58652	58679	58649	58649	Reese	101	“And there ’s a reason you ’ve had Bobbie send flowers and a note of cease and desist to every date you ’ve had since Gwyneth … ”
58684	58687	58680	58680	Tag	109	“ Sorry . ”“Relax
58689	58712	58680	58680	Tag	109	” He put a palm on his brother ’s shoulder . Mom had been a worrier . Tag came by it honestly . “
58734	58802	58680	58680	Tag	109	”Not only had they sweated out their problems in bed , but she ’d also hopped up and went right to work afterward . She had n’t been clingy or emotional , and was no longer crying in the shower , so he was glad about that . She more than understood what was between them , and Reese was happy to let her use him physically . “There
58807	58820	58680	58680	Tag	109	” Tag said , genuine worry fusing his features into a mask . “
58836	58846	58847	58847	Reese	101	”“She ’s making out like a bandit , Tag . ”
58854	58889	58827	58827	she	84	“ Her hotel will be in her name , free and clear . She could n’t care less about my position at Crane save for the fact it ’s getting her what she wants . ”The
58955	58962	58952	58952	Reese	101	“ I ’m sure of it . ”“You
58968	58984	58952	58952	Reese	101	” Tag stepped out of the office door , his voice just above a whisper . “
59000	59007	59008	59008	Reese	101	’”“I know what I ’m doing . ”
59029	59034	59035	59035	Tag	109	“I know you do . ”
59069	59072	59056	59056	he	438	“ And , Clip?”Reese
59075	59097	59056	59056	he	438	“You can fuck her . But do n’t fuck her over . She ’s not one of your one - nighters . ”On
59136	59140	59141	59141	He	89	“Your cards came . ”
59253	59262	59245	59245	them	1303	“ Marriage looks good on you , Merina . ”If
59276	59291	59245	59245	them	1303	“Thank you , Arnold . I did n’t even think to change the cards . ”
59304	59311	59317	59317	she	84	“You have your mother to thank . ”
59331	59344	59327	59327	he	89	“ I always wondered how different marriage was for women than men . ”
59350	59387	59345	59345	His	89	“ My wife had to leave her family and move to my house . Change her name to my last name . And let me tell you , she was not excited about becoming a Woodcock . ”
59430	59476	59424	59424	Merina	84	“Adeline was a strong woman , but she was old - fashioned . She said that things were supposed to be like that according to God . A woman submitting to her husband . Did you know that verse does n’t mean what people think it means?”Merina
59501	59587	59588	59588	He	89	“People think it means to come under someone ’s control , but that ’s not the translation . If a wife submits to a husband , she ’s giving him a gift . She ’s giving him the opportunity to be a man . Without that lesson , he wo n’t be strong . Instead , he will be weak and in response , she will feel as if she has to protect herself . That ’s not the way it ’s supposed to be . ”
59594	59631	59588	59588	He	89	“ Just because you women can protect yourselves and be your own warriors does n’t mean you should . Men need a chance to do that too . To protect and love you makes us better . ”“I
59640	59720	59590	59590	his	89	” she admitted . But then again , had she ever dated a man who was n’t perfectly willing to let her handle the hard things ? To let her handle everything ? Corbin came to mind . He was definitely not the chivalrous type . He had no problem watching her work hard and taking her money . Reese on the other hand … Her face heated as she remembered him saying Ladies first in bed last night . “Love
59727	59742	59724	59725	Mrs. Crane	101	” Arnold smiled and handed her the business card she ’d just put back . “
59748	59754	59755	59755	she	1307	”“Adeline was a lucky lady , ”
59773	59777	59778	59778	he	89	shared?“I was lucky , ”
59781	59792	59778	59778	he	89	“ I was n’t this man before I knew her . ”That
59859	59861	59853	59853	Arnold	89	“ spring ”
59865	59868	59853	59853	Arnold	89	“ frisky , ”
60019	60023	60024	60024	he	1320	“I texted you , ”
60107	60112	60113	60113	She	84	“Things have been nuts . ”
60144	60151	60152	60152	He	1320	“Let me take you to dinner . ”
60217	60221	60222	60222	Merina	84	“Hello , Reese . ”
60234	60239	60240	60240	He	1320	“Mrs . Van Heusen . ”
60255	60274	60242	60242	his	1320	“ I was going to say drinks first , but you look as if you need to eat . ”“You
60296	60300	60318	60318	you	84	”Oh my God . “Mom
60302	60317	60318	60318	you	84	” She tried to communicate with a glare that Jolie was overstepping her bounds . “Did
60325	60330	60318	60318	you	84	” Jolie asked Merina . “I
60336	60337	60334	60334	you	84	”“Did Reese?”Merina
60359	60371	60374	60374	him	1328	“ He has now . I ’ll just grab my things , ”
60390	60395	60396	60396	Jolie	91	“What are you doing ? ”
60421	60439	60399	60399	She	84	“ I ’m not sure what you ’re up to , but please try and behave yourself . ”“You
60443	60447	60449	60449	you	341	” Jolie shrugged . “
60455	60464	60449	60449	you	341	friendly?”“Friendly , yes , but fake , no . ”
60496	60539	60540	60540	Jolie	91	“Just because I ’m not sure why you married him so quickly does n’t mean I wo n’t welcome him like I would any son - in - law . We ’ll be spending cookouts and holidays together for years to come . ”
60548	60558	60540	60540	Jolie	91	“ And maybe celebrating with grandbabies in the future . ”“Mom
60560	60565	60566	60566	I	0	” Merina nearly choked . “
60579	60584	60585	60586	Her mother	341	”“I bet you are . ”
60620	60640	60643	60643	sweetie	1336	“I ca n’t do this right now . I love you . I ’m going to dinner with Reese . ”“Have
60649	60722	60646	60646	you	1336	”Years to come . Grandbabies . Oy . * * * The check took its sweet time coming to the table , then the valet spent precious minutes locating the car , and then when Reese arrived at the mansion , Magda took more of his time relaying household details he really did n’t want to hear right now . Reason being , during dinner , Merina had leaned close and whispered , “
60729	60749	60646	60646	you	1336	night?”Forgetting his steak dinner , he threw his napkin on the table and signaled the waiter for the check . “I
60754	60803	60646	60646	you	1336	” she ’d quietly reprimanded . Merina had eaten some of the shrimp appetizer , a salad , and a dinner roll , so he knew she was n’t starving . Tonight , he could subsist on her alone . So his reply was a curt but heartfelt , “
60807	61038	61040	61040	God	129	”Watching her bite her lip sent fire pouring through his veins . He had n’t had enough of her and tonight was testing his patience . As evidenced when Magda said good night . The moment she was out the door , Reese cupped the back of Merina ’s head and backed her through the foyer to the staircase , his mouth on hers . He took the banister with his other hand and walked her up the stairs , refusing to unseal his mouth from hers until they were close to the bedroom . They did n’t make it . He pressed her against the wall , his self - control dwindling , his erection pulsing . Fingers fumbling , he managed to open two delicate buttons of her shirt before she reached up and finished the job for him , dropping it to the ground and greedily seeking his kisses . He liked her greedy . He liked her half naked . Burying his fingers into her hair , he reached around and flicked her bra open with the other . Then he freed her breasts , lowering his lips to taste first one nipple , then the next . The sensitive bud tightened on his tongue . He continued laving her , loving the way she writhed and the way her breath caught as he suckled her . “Reese
61042	61057	61040	61040	God	129	” she moaned , her hand in his hair , and arched her back . “
61065	61067	61068	61068	He	1337	”“Same . ”
61241	61247	61248	61248	she	0	“No , not out here , ”
61358	61363	61364	61364	she	0	“Please , oh please , ”
61424	61428	61429	61429	he	1337	“Come , beautiful , ”
61553	61561	61562	61562	she	0	“I suppose you ’re proud of yourself , ”
61572	61575	61576	61576	he	1337	“Damn straight , ”
61605	61617	61618	61618	Merina	84	“ No wonder the girls want you to call them back , ”
61654	61667	61647	61647	she	84	“ Dinner was nice . What I ate of it , anyway . ”“Hmm
61669	61688	61647	61647	she	84	” He sent a gaze down her body and up . Chills rose on her skin in response . “
61702	61720	61764	61764	His	1345	”When he reached for his tie , her breath snagged . His hand halted over the knot . “
61731	61750	61751	61751	I	0	tie?”Merina pushed to her knees and tugged the length of striped silk , bringing his face to hers . “
61760	61763	61758	61758	Crane	101	”“Control freak . ”
61818	61823	61824	61824	she	84	“Turnabout is fair play , ”
61860	61865	61849	61849	she	84	“I did n’t expect … ”
62007	62009	62010	62010	His	1345	“Merina . ”
62120	62126	62127	62127	she	84	“I like you like this , ”
62131	62137	62127	62127	she	84	“ Take your pants off . ”
62177	62183	62165	62165	she	84	“ Oh no you don’t . ”“You
62190	62421	62165	62165	she	84	” He cupped her hips in his large hands , making her want to take back those words , but then she remembered that most of her fantasies had included her on top , so the answer was yes . She wanted control tonight . Sliding one leg over his , she pushed her breasts out as she straddled him . When he raised his hand to touch her , it was to draw a line over her tattoo . His eyes locked on hers , filled to the brim with heat , and he lifted his head slightly off the pillow . She kissed him , a soft sigh tickling her throat as his hands moved to her breasts . Reese took control from her , sliding his tongue along hers and slowing the pace . He turned her inside out with each thick , delicious , drugging kiss , and she found her hold loosening . Her body softening . Her mind melting . Before she knew what happened , the world was rotating and she was on her back again . When she opened her eyes , Reese was rolling on a condom . Before she could complain that this was not his show to run , he was between her thighs and sliding home in one strong stroke . Slow . Then out again even slower . “Yes
62423	62442	62443	62443	Reese	101	” Holding on to him , Merina uttered the name she ’d avoided using as much as possible . “
62445	62510	62165	62165	she	84	” * * * Reese returned from disposing of the condom and collapsed facedown next to Merina , who was lying on her back , arm over her eyes . She hummed and he heard the smile there . Then he lifted his head and saw it too . Propped on his arms , he leaned over and kissed the corner of that smile . “You
62516	62521	62165	62165	she	84	” he pointed out , “
62533	62594	62165	62165	she	84	right?”She lifted her arm and peeked out at him , a smudge of mascara under her eyes . He reached over with his thumb and swiped it away . It took a few gentle tugs , but eventually she was perfect again instead of raccoon - eyed . Although , raccoon - eyed , she was pretty damn perfect too . “You
62606	62610	62603	62603	you	101	needy?”“Back to Crane ? ”
62652	62660	62661	62661	he	1347	“ I do n’t need a compliment , ”
62665	62675	62661	62661	he	1347	“ I know how good I am in bed . ”“Whatever
62677	62681	62661	62661	he	1347	” She snorted . “Your
62692	62772	62690	62690	Merina	84	”Something fragile flickered in her eyes . Not hurt or anger , but vulnerability . It caused an answering thud in his chest and a simultaneous wave of panic . When they ’d agreed to marry for show , he did n’t expect to have sex with her , and he ’d bet his fortune she was n’t planning on having sex with him . That mystery unearthed , they were now stuck in the light with each other . “You
62776	62826	62690	62690	Merina	84	” he said . He was learning about her , having slept with her more than once . The prospect of sleeping with her again made him want to know more . What made her tick ? What did she like done to her ? What did she like to do?“Who
62830	62871	62690	62690	Merina	84	” She rolled to face him , goose bumps puckering her arms . He maneuvered off the comforter and tossed it over her . He stroked her blanket - covered arm , warming her from the room ’s chilly air . “Plenty
62879	62883	62875	62875	they	2643	” he answered , “
62907	62917	62903	62903	You	1349	”“You’re referring to the blow job , I presume . ”
62944	62955	62957	62957	he	1350	“ I ’m sure you ’ve had plenty of those . ”Belatedly
62960	62964	62959	62959	his	1350	“ plenty of women ”
62986	63002	62959	62959	his	1350	“ I wo n’t talk about the women I ’ve been with in the past . ”“Like
63009	63011	63012	63012	He	1350	women?”“Ridiculous ? ”
63018	63028	63012	63012	He	1350	“Silly . Vapid . Take your pick of adjectives . ”“Some
63038	63046	63012	63012	He	1350	” he said in his own defense . “
63063	63074	63075	63075	She	1353	”“I guess I sort of fit into that category now … ”
63078	63096	63075	63075	She	1353	“That ’s different . We had a business agreement for the hotel , for CEO . This … ”
63106	63115	63097	63097	He	1350	“ This was n’t part of the deal . ”“No
63117	63123	63097	63097	He	1350	” Her eyes found his . “
63128	63145	63146	63146	He	1350	”“I’m not going to use it against you . You know that , do n’t you ? ”
63184	63187	63178	63178	He	1350	“I know . ”
63246	63254	63255	63255	He	1350	“Let ’s talk about this , then . ”
63269	63277	63280	63280	you	1353	“ I should know what this means . ”“Oh
63282	63292	63280	63280	you	1353	” Feisty . Just the way he liked her . “Given
63332	63335	63336	63336	Her	1353	”“You’re good . ”
63346	63349	63336	63336	Her	1353	“Thank you . ”“It’s
63361	63366	63367	63367	He	1350	”“What are you hiding ? ”
63386	63393	63394	63394	She	1353	“I think we should talk less . ”
63448	63452	63453	63453	she	1353	“Why , yes , ”
63456	63465	63453	63453	she	1353	“ I believe part of you is ready . ”
63695	63698	63699	63699	he	1350	“Your tattoo , ”
63788	63802	64134	64134	Merina	84	” Reese yanked the knot out of the bow tie and started over . “You’re
63807	63851	64134	64134	Merina	84	” Merina appeared behind him in the doorway of his closet , balancing on one foot to pull on her other silver high heel . Her gown was blue and sparkly and short enough to display succulent thighs that made his mouth water . “You’re
63859	63903	63907	63907	you	1350	” Bow tie forgotten , he went to her , scooping her close and kissing her . A line had been crossed . One where he grabbed her up without hesitation , and one where she came to him , no questions asked . “How
63914	63927	63907	63907	you	1350	” Her hands went to the tie and she frowned , perplexed . “Very
63930	64098	64100	64100	fella	1358	” He let go and resumed his battle with the strip of silk while Merina went to the mirror to straighten her skirt . Of all things , he thought back to Tag ’s words of warning . Because life with Merina was suddenly very cozy . Once they divorced , he ’d miss not only the sex , but the relaxing moments that followed . He did n’t anticipate this type of casual banter once he resumed his casual dating status . At that thought , he nearly recoiled . Casual dating had never sounded so … off - putting . He would n’t do it right away , of course . He ’d have to have a cooling period . And figure out a way to settle for less , considering sex had never been this good before Merina . Whoa . Probably that was his cock talking . It bobbed in the direction of the woman unknowingly torturing him in a very short dress . “Easy
64102	64119	64100	64100	fella	1358	” he murmured , succeeding at the knot and straightening the bow tie at his throat . “
64131	64133	64134	64134	Merina	84	”“Hmm ? ”
64137	64141	64134	64134	Merina	84	“ Did you say something?”He
64154	64171	64172	64172	He	1362	“ Yeah . I said , beware the board . They have sharp , pointy teeth . ”
64185	64190	64191	64191	She	84	“Monty Python ? Really ? ”
64563	64588	64589	64589	Reese	101	“Merina , I ’d like you meet a few members of the board . I do n’t believe you ’ve had the honor yet , ”
64746	64753	64730	64730	He	2814	“There . Now you ’re perfect . ”
64788	64800	64778	64778	her	84	“ I only like you rumpled in one place , Crane . ”Reese
64823	64828	64829	64829	he	2814	“ Thanks , baby , ”
64862	64864	64856	64856	he	2814	“ sweetheart ”
64866	64868	64856	64856	he	2814	“ honey ”
64870	64873	64856	64856	he	2814	“ baby . ”She
64887	64893	64894	64898	One of the board members	1377	“Better leave these two alone . ”
64910	64921	64894	64898	One of the board members	1377	“ Come , Barnes , a refill is in order . ”“And
64926	64935	64896	64898	the board members	1046	” she said when the men shuffled away . “How
64950	64954	64894	64898	One of the board members	1377	” Reese said . “
64955	64965	64896	64898	the board members	1046	Champagne?”“White wine is safer . Makes me less giggly . ”“You
64976	65086	64970	64970	I	0	” He pressed a kiss to her forehead , and Merina leaned into him . A moment later , his hand stiffened against her back . In fact , all of him went rigid . Arms , legs , head , neck . Merina searched the room , her eyes landing on a petite woman with strawberry - blond hair . Freckles dotted her tanned skin , and lips that looked as if they ’d had some cosmetic plumping smiled as she sauntered in their direction . Merina heard a word come from Reese ’s mouth she was pretty sure was profanity but could n’t quite make it out . “Reese
65088	65113	64970	64970	I	0	” the woman said , her plastic smile glued on . Her eyes — green — flicked to Merina before fixing on him again . “
65119	65125	65126	65126	Reese	101	”“What are you doing here ? ”
65137	65159	65126	65126	Reese	101	“Hayes is here too . You know we would n’t miss the chance to wish Alex well on his big day . ”
65188	65191	65198	65198	she	84	“Merina Crane . ”
65206	65209	65198	65198	she	84	“ And you are?”“Gwyneth
65221	65251	65198	65198	she	84	”Gwyneth Sutton Lerner rang zero bells . Clearly this woman and Reese had a history . And she refused to let Gwyneth think that Merina was in the dark . “My
65258	65282	65198	65198	she	84	” Merina slid a gaze down the woman ’s lithe figure and back up to see Gwyneth ’s mouth slide into a sneer . “
65293	65311	65198	65198	she	84	”Merina steered toward a wine cart , Reese ’s arm under her hand as rigid as rebar . “Care
65315	65337	65198	65198	she	84	” she asked as they strolled . Well , she strolled ; Reese marched since he was too tense to stroll . “No
65339	65343	65198	65198	she	84	” he answered . “Well
65362	65368	65412	65414	this Gwyneth woman	1384	”“I said no , Merina . ”The
65447	65456	65457	65457	He	1385	“ I ’m going to grab a scotch . ”
65841	65844	65845	65845	he	1389	“Scotch neat , ”
65848	65856	65845	65845	he	1389	“ Actually , make it a double . ”The
65922	65925	65904	65904	Tag	109	“ Hi . ”“Do
65931	65966	65904	65904	Tag	109	” Reese asked under his breath . The bartender cleared her throat and gave them some privacy . One of the benefits to being a Crane was that the staff tended to respect them . “Do
65969	65979	65904	65904	Tag	109	” An easy grin appeared on Tag ’s face . “
65998	66008	65904	65904	Tag	109	”“I do n’t give a shit who ’s looking . ”“I
66013	66027	65904	65904	Tag	109	” Tag deposited the glass behind the bar and pointed across the room . “
66039	66116	65904	65904	Tag	109	”He turned to walk away and Reese followed . Tag kept up conversation , talking about absolutely nothing as they cut through the crowd , pausing to say hello to a few people Reese had n’t greeted yet . Once they were at a bar lined with taps , Tag ordered a few beers . From this part of the room , they could see the crowd , and no one was close enough to overhear . “Let
66136	66155	65904	65904	Tag	109	” Tag took a drink of his beer , filling his cheeks with the brew before he swallowed . “Merina
66165	66191	66192	66192	you	109	” Questions like who was Gwyneth to him , how long did they date , and what about her presence turned Reese into an overly starched shirt?“And
66233	66240	66226	66226	She	84	” Tag lost his easy grin . “You
66248	66279	66280	66280	Tag	109	”“You forget I know a hell of a lot more about women than you do . Your wife is by herself after you introduced her to your ex - girlfriend . ”
66291	66302	66344	66344	she	84	“ I ’m not the only one noticing , Reese . ”He
66347	66380	66344	66344	she	84	Merina?“I suggest you sweep Merina in your arms and start dancing . Better yet , take her into one of the side rooms and have sex with her up against a wall . ”Reese
66389	66396	66397	66397	Tag	109	“Thought that ’d grab your attention . ”
66404	66422	66344	66344	she	84	“ Anything is better than everyone witnessing you nursing your wounds after Gwyneth dive - bombed you . ”“Can’t
66429	66433	66435	66435	you	438	” Reese growled . “No
66439	66484	66485	66485	I	0	” This came from their father . The man of the hour was wearing an all - black tuxedo , tuxedo shirt , and bow tie . The stark contrast against his white beard and white hair made him look that much more regal . “
66502	66504	66505	66505	Reese	101	”“Bullshit , ”
66605	66609	66610	66610	Reese	101	“All due respect , ”
66615	66635	66610	66610	Reese	101	“ you do n’t know what you ’re talking about when it comes to them and you never did . ”Alex
66642	66644	66645	66645	Tag	109	“Reese . ”
66653	66656	66645	66645	Tag	109	“ Dad . ”Alex
66665	66669	66670	66670	Tag	109	“Eyes all around , ”
66673	66679	66680	66680	Reese	101	“I’m sick of the show , ”
66705	66723	66724	66724	Alex	96	“You need to say hello to him , Reese . Tag is right . People are watching , ”
66751	66755	66757	66757	his	1413	“ Grow up . ”Reese
66761	66764	66765	66765	Alex	96	“Watch him . ”
66782	66786	66789	66789	Tag	109	“Breathe , Reese . ”“Fuck
66791	66834	66789	66789	Tag	109	” Reese turned on his heel and went to the other bar , where the female bartender was about to empty his abandoned scotch down the drain . He snatched the glass from her and drank it down in three burning swallows . “
66839	66887	66889	66889	sailor	1422	you?”At the same time , a cool hand slid over his tuxedo jacket . He turned his head to find a freckled hand resting on his forearm , a very big diamond ring on her finger . He lifted his chin and met Gwyneth ’s green eyes . “Hey
66891	66899	66789	66789	Tag	109	” Her lips bowed into a smile . “
66905	66976	66789	66789	Tag	109	” * * * Oh . My . God . Watching Reese medicate himself with scotch was one thing , but standing idly by while Gwyneth kamikazed him was another . Merina was n’t going to allow the skinny redhead to hit on her husband . She finished her wine and relinquished the glass , but before she took two steps toward Reese , Tag stepped in front of her . “May
66982	66990	66992	66992	I	0	” A smile lifted his trimmed beard . “No
67001	67006	66992	66992	I	0	” She smiled sweetly . “Ah
67018	67029	67030	67030	you	0	” He offered his hand . She regarded it suspiciously . “Are
67039	67043	67044	67044	He	1425	did?”“I doubt it . ”
67149	67154	67138	67138	He	109	“Just remember to smile . ”She
67164	67167	67138	67138	He	109	“ How ’s that?”His
67191	67221	67183	67183	he	109	“ I kid , I kid . Come on , Sis , relax . I promise it ’s not as big of a deal as you ’re making it . ”“Really?”“Probably
67223	67396	67398	67398	she	1433	”Tag ’s eyes were lighter blue than Reese ’s , his hair sun - kissed and golden , the waves hanging over a white button - down shirt that had to have been custom - tailored to cover the expanse of his shoulders . She’d met Tag once before at a conference . Towering over everyone , dressed in a tight T - shirt hugging his rounded muscles and sporting a bearded smile that was oh - so - genuine , he was n’t an easy person to overlook . He carried the Crane air of confidence and moved like he was in charge . And he was not bad on the eyes . She ’d noticed that as well , though her danger - o - meter went off the moment he came near . This guy was a player . He towered over Merina , even taller than Reese by a few inches , so she had to tilt her head a little more than usual to talk to him . “Who
67400	67404	67398	67398	she	1433	” she asked . “Who
67406	67442	67445	67445	her	1433	” Tag ’s eyes flicked to the side , then back . He grinned . How full of shit was he ? Merina rolled her eyes to let him know she was n’t buying it . “
67447	67451	67445	67445	her	1433	”“Yeah , her . ”“That
67461	67485	67445	67445	her	1433	” True , but she did n’t feel like being fair . She wanted to know the truth and Reese was n’t talking . “Obviously
67493	67541	67543	67543	she	1433	”Tag laughed and squeezed her hand in his . Merina stole a casual look over her shoulder , making out Reese ’s arm and Gwyneth ’s dress before Tag moved her again and blocked her view with his huge body . Merina pegged him with a glare . “
67545	67558	67559	67559	Tag	109	socialite?”“You could say that . She cares a great deal about money , ”
67562	67569	67570	67570	she	1435	“Were his flowers not well received ? ”
67573	67580	67581	67581	Tag	109	“No can do on the intel . ”
67586	67621	67583	67583	his	109	“ I have a suggestion , though . When he comes back over here , seduce him . Make him a little hot under the collar in front of everyone and then take him home and”—he
67622	67625	67583	67583	his	109	winked—“you know . ”“Kiss
67631	67646	67583	67583	his	109	” She kept her voice down , but she did n’t hide her anger . “
67669	67675	67676	67676	Reese	101	”“Did I hear my name ? ”
67714	67716	67707	67707	He	109	“ May I?”“Please
67718	67738	67707	67707	He	109	” She pulled away from Tag , who released her waist and gave his brother a look of concern . “Sure
67743	67747	67707	67707	He	109	” Tag asked . “I’m
67753	67784	67707	67707	He	109	” Reese gave his brother a nod and Tag nodded back . In the midst of that subtle exchange , she guessed these two would do anything for each other . “I
67793	67828	67707	67707	He	109	” she told Reese as she narrowed her eyes at Tag ’s retreating figure . Several women ’s heads turned and several of them were with dates or husbands . She clucked her tongue . “Go
67833	67878	67707	67707	He	109	” Reese tucked her against his body , and she instantly subdued , settling against him like she fit there . Tag was attractive , yes , but nothing was as electric as being held by Reese . All of her tingled . Sizzled . “He
67885	67892	67893	67893	She	0	”“I saw her talking to you . ”
67922	67938	67911	67911	Reese	101	“ She told me where she and Hayes were sitting so I could say hello . ”His
67947	67954	67955	67955	Merina	84	“It looked more intimate than that , ”
67962	67988	67955	67955	Merina	84	“After this song , I ’ll introduce you . You should n’t have been in the position to introduce yourself and I apologize for that . ”His
67994	67997	67955	67955	Merina	84	“ Reese . ”“Merina
67999	68036	68037	68037	you	109	” He pulled her close , splaying his hand across her back . Lost in his eyes for a few staggering seconds , she almost forgot what she was going to say . Then she remembered . “Do
68044	68053	68037	68037	you	109	” Whatever put that truckload of hurt in your eyes?“Not
68056	68075	68037	68037	you	109	” he said after a few beats . She ’d take it . That was better than the staunch “
68077	68083	68084	68084	I	0	” she ’d received earlier . “
68097	68155	68095	68095	Merina	84	”But he was n’t doing her any favors by shielding her . She did n’t want Reese hiding his anguish from her . She ’d rather him lay it on her lap so she could help him with it . A tiny voice of warning rose up and refused to be ignored . Had n’t she tried to “
68157	68358	68359	68359	Gwyneth	153	” Corbin by letting him move in with her ? The last thing she needed to know was Reese ’s messy history with any of the women he ’d had in his life or his bed . Especially since Merina would be leaving both sooner rather than later . * * * The music slowed and Reese released Merina , most of him not wanting to . Holding her comforted him and allowed him to put off playing nice with the last two people on earth he wanted to be cordial with . Unfortunately , his father and brother were right . Reese could n’t avoid them . Or he should n’t , anyway . What would the CEO of Crane Hotels do?He sighed and Merina took his hand , offering her steady brand of comfort . It was a novelty to have a woman at his side for anything other than business or pleasure . This was neither . She offered her friendship and support and nothing about her was faking it . She was here for him . He kept hold of her hand , and as they crossed the room , he told her the truncated truth . “
68395	68413	68389	68390	my father	1075	”She was quiet as they drew closer to the couple that had irrevocably changed Reese ’s life . “Sounds
68422	68503	68389	68390	my father	1075	” Merina said , not fully accepting his offered half measure . But then , he had n’t expected her to . She was smart and sharp and unafraid to speak her mind . Three things Gwyneth never was . The redhead who used to share Reese ’s bed had nothing on the suave blonde at his side today . He pulled Merina closer , resting her hand at the crook of his arm and glancing down into amber eyes . “
68514	68517	68518	68518	They	1441	”“Fair enough . ”
68649	68656	68657	68657	Hayes	198	“I guess congratulations are in order , ”
68663	68678	68657	68657	Hayes	198	“ On your marriage and I assume you ’re taking over for your dad . ”“One
68691	68758	68759	68759	Lerner	153	” Reese replied , his tone smooth . Hayes ’s eyebrows jumped in consideration . He still had a small white scar on his lip from where Reese had clocked him . He ’d landed a hit on his nose , too , but the bump on the bridge had predated Reese ’s fury . Probably some other boyfriend he ’d pissed off in the past . “Hayes
68761	68795	68797	68797	Lerner	153	” He offered a hand to Merina , but she wrapped both hands around Reese ’s biceps and smiled instead of touching him . Reese admired the hell out of her for it . “Mr
68799	68854	68797	68797	Lerner	153	” She did n’t make an excuse for not shaking his hand , and there was nothing rude in her words or expression . Hayes , realizing she was n’t going to be cordial , awkwardly pulled his hand away . Reese wanted to kiss her . Later , he ’d show his appreciation . “Your
68862	68886	68890	68890	you	153	” Merina told Hayes . From the chair beside her husband , Gwyneth looked down her nose . Merina unwaveringly held her gaze . “It
68899	68903	68890	68890	you	153	” Merina said . “
68921	68932	68890	68890	you	153	”Reese smothered a smile , practically hearing the mic drop . “I
68939	69007	69029	69029	Gwynnie	218	” Gwyneth hissed . But she was way out of her league . Her freckled cheeks went ruddy , betraying her anger . She ’d never been good at hiding her temper . She and Reese had gone round and round over the stupidest shit when they ’d dated . And then they ’d gone round and round over Hayes , which turned out was even stupider . “Alex
69013	69028	69029	69029	Gwynnie	218	” Hayes interjected , putting his hand over his wife ’s to calm her . “
69067	69104	69128	69128	he	1454	”Pompous prick . That was the exact reason Reese bounced his fist off Hayes ’s face all those years ago . He flexed his hand with the temptation to do it now too . Smarmy dickweed . “Alex
69110	69124	69106	69108	a good man	1454	” Merina stroked Reese ’s arm , bringing his temper down a notch . “
69148	69157	69143	69143	you	0	” In a stage whisper , she added , “
69189	69230	69185	69185	I	0	”Merina gave Gwyneth a saucy wink and snatched a cube of cheese off Gwyneth ’s plate and ate it . She sucked on the tip of her thumb in what had to be the sexiest move Reese had ever seen . “
69270	69320	69234	69234	you	0	”Her arm wrapped around his , Merina turned . He walked with her , a smile tickling the edge of his mouth and a twitch coming from the recesses of his tuxedo pants . Bawdy and refined . That was his Merina . His . At least for now . “Now
69331	69344	69234	69234	you	0	” she said as they left the ballroom . Right fucking now . “No
69347	69381	69234	69234	you	0	” He flattened her back to the wall outside the door . Her eyes flared , her mouth curving into a pleased smile . He leaned close and brushed her nose with his . “
69386	69405	69383	69383	’em	1456	”Then he tipped her jaw and covered her lips with his and kissed her for all he was worth .
69602	69605	69606	69606	she	84	“Cocky bastard , ”
69648	69654	69672	69672	he	1458	“ Do you always wake up smiling?”He
69695	69699	69700	69700	he	1458	“I wake smiling , ”
69708	69722	69700	69700	he	1458	“ whenever the woman I go to bed with has six screaming orgasms . ”“Six
69724	69737	69700	69700	he	1458	” she protested , pushing against his bare chest with both hands . “Was
69745	69762	69700	69700	he	1458	” He loosened his hold on her and pulled back to find her rolling her eyes . “Hardly
69764	69814	69700	69700	he	1458	” She wiggled away from him , then climbed out of bed . She was wearing almost nothing : a barely - there pair of panties and a silky tank top . When she was on her feet , she grabbed a pillow and tossed it over his face . “I’m
69818	69954	69963	69963	you	1463	” he said , his voice muffled . She grumbled something else and he moved the pillow in time to watch her fantastic ass wiggle into the bathroom . Then he rolled over , and despite the shining sun , closed his eyes and went back to sleep . * * * An hour later , Reese emerged wearing a suit and tie , looking bright - eyed and bushy - tailed and ready to take over hotel chains and turn them into dust . Merina was dressed in her usual uniform of pencil - skirt - and - blouse but doubted she looked either bright or bushy . Unless you counted her hair , which she ’d wrestled with for nearly twenty minutes before giving up and pinning it back in a low ponytail . “I
69970	69991	69963	69963	you	1463	” he said in greeting , moving to the coffeepot . His gaze strayed to the mug in her hands . “What?”“I
70006	70010	70011	70011	She	1463	”“I like it . ”
70017	70022	70011	70011	She	1463	“Of course you do . ”“It
70026	70031	70011	70011	She	1463	”“Of course it is . ”The
70068	70075	70076	70076	She	1463	“You mean this is … yours ? ”
70086	70097	70076	70076	She	1463	“ ‘ Sometimes all you need is a billion dollars . ’”Reese
70177	70181	70182	70182	Reese	101	“Tag bought it , ”
70185	70192	70182	70182	Reese	101	“ He thinks he ’s funny . ”At
70249	70261	70265	70265	he	1464	“What did he say at the party that pissed you off so much?”“It
70276	70377	70265	70265	he	1464	”But she did know . She did n’t want to admit it , but she knew . It was the way Tag instructed her to seduce Reese . The suggestion that what she and Reese had was for show … which it was . But she did n’t like to talk about him or what they had in such obvious , sterile terms . Tag had made their marriage sound cold , but with her , Reese was n’t cold . That night , last night , and hell , even this morning , there was considerable warmth between them . “I
70384	70388	70265	70265	he	1464	” she fibbed . “Ah
70390	70399	70265	70265	he	1464	” Satisfied with that answer , he nodded . “
70418	70424	70426	70426	I	0	” He stole a kiss . “
70446	70456	70440	70440	you	0	”“You needed it . We had a stressful weekend . ”
70546	70562	70563	70563	She	84	“Are you sure you do n’t want to tell me more about your sordid past ? ”
70615	70618	70612	70612	Reese	101	“Nice try . ”
70631	70662	70619	70619	He	1472	“ I can drop you at work , but I have to go to a dinner meeting at eight , so you ’ll have to find your own way home . ”“No
70687	70697	70681	70681	I	0	” Including an overdue therapeutic lunch date with Lorelei . “Okay
70709	70722	70681	70681	I	0	”She narrowed her eyes in confusion . He pointed to the mug . “Having
70731	70750	70681	70681	I	0	” He kissed her again , lingering long enough that she had to pull air through her nose . “
70755	70881	70752	70752	you	1476	”He left and Merina shook her head , worried that her current set of problems could n’t be solved by a billion dollars . Arguably , her problems were caused by a billion dollars . Which was the reason for her meeting with Lorelei . Things with Reese were getting complicated where her emotions were concerned . And since she knew her best friend was re - seeing her ex - husband ( though Lore had yet to officially admit it ) , she could help Merina compartmentalize when it came to Reese . Merina needed to keep her heart separate from the sex . Because the sex was great and she refused to give up the best perk to this arrangement . * * * “
70889	70911	70752	70752	you	1476	”Her fork halfway to her mouth , Merina lowered it back into her salad bowl and gaped at her best friend . “
70912	70915	70752	70752	you	1476	Malcolm?”“I know ! ”
70951	70958	70943	70943	She	127	“ I did n’t mean to . ”“This
70962	70994	70943	70943	She	127	” Merina muttered , abandoning the salad in favor of her own glass of wine . Lorelei peeked from her hands , an expression of devastation decorating her flawless brown skin . “
71000	71036	71037	71037	She	127	it?”“I meant for me . You were supposed to be the voice of reason . I came here to talk to you about keeping my heart out of the equation with Reese since we ’ve … ”
71050	71056	71037	71037	She	127	“ Crossed a few boundaries . ”Lorelei
71065	71066	71037	71037	She	127	“ Boundaries?”Merina
71069	71073	71037	71037	She	127	“Did he earn his hashtag?”“Lore
71077	71097	71037	71037	She	127	” She lowered her voice when a pair of well - dressed women shot twin evil looks at her . “
71121	71134	71109	71109	I	0	”Lorelei folded her arms on the table and shrugged one shoulder unapologetically . “Yes
71161	71190	71109	71109	I	0	”“Well , maybe you are the only one who knows what he ’s capable of since he ’s kept you in his bed for more than one night . ”There
71272	71281	71282	71282	Lorelei	127	“Listen , you ’re going to be fine . ”
71313	71316	71290	71290	She	127	“Hit me . ”“First
71319	71326	71290	71290	She	127	” Lorelei held up a finger . “
71333	71338	71327	71327	Malcolm	134	” Her smile fell . “
71373	71377	71378	71378	Merina	84	”“I’m with you . ”
71402	71412	71413	71413	Lore	128	“Malcolm and I have a relationship that is volatile , ”
71416	71437	71413	71413	Lore	128	“ You know , the kind where everyone has a quip for everything . Bickering became like foreplay with us . ”Merina
71450	71510	71511	71511	Lorelei	127	“Plus he had a rep before he met me of being quite the ladies ’ man . Once he met me , he quit those bitches cold and I was the only one he had eyes for . He went from player to a good husband and the only reason we split was because I was too stubborn to — ”
71551	71555	71556	71556	Lore	128	“Sorry , honey . ”
71585	71593	71594	71594	Lorelei	127	“ It ’s not for sure yet , ”
71602	71635	71594	71594	Lorelei	127	“ Maybe he ’ll turn back into a dick . Like … Cinderella at the stroke of midnight . Give him time and he ’ll give you a reason to hate him . ”“Okay
71637	71683	71594	71594	Lorelei	127	” Merina said , but that did n’t make her feel any better . Because maybe … just maybe , she was enjoying herself too much . Enjoying Reese too much to be willing to hate him . If she ever had . * * * “
71702	71744	71594	71594	Lorelei	127	” Bob said at the board meeting . Reese fisted the pen in his hand , willing himself not to throw it like a dart and hit one of them with it . Any of them . He was n’t picky . “You
71751	71773	71774	71774	Reese	101	” Alex said , leaning back in his chair . How did he do that ? Always look so damned calm ? “
71805	71808	71809	71809	Frank	113	”“We’re aware , ”
71862	71866	71867	71867	Bob	173	“I will say , ”
71878	71895	71867	71867	Bob	173	“ that the few stockholders I ’ve spoken to have been impressed with his recent turnaround . ”“Yes
71905	71909	71867	71867	Bob	173	” Frank said , “
71925	71940	71941	71941	Reese	101	”“The state of my personal life has nothing to do with my business ethics , ”
71961	71969	71955	71956	his father	2387	“ Leave my wife out of this . ”“And
71985	71989	71972	71972	you	101	” Lilith said . “
72022	72052	72056	72056	Lilith	114	CEO?”It was on the tip of Reese ’s tongue to ask if that would be so bad , but he was relieved of that urge by Bob ’s interjection . “
72066	72071	72072	72072	she	114	”“Could be an act , ”
72080	72101	72075	72075	Reese	101	“Well you ca n’t expect them to consummate on the boardroom table for you to see how serious they are , ”
72116	72120	72102	72102	Frank	113	“Over the line . ”
72131	72151	72121	72121	Reese	101	“ If you think I ’d pander to you or the stockholders , you ’re out of your mind . ”He
72190	72240	72272	72272	Frank	113	“My father is right . I ’ve been groomed for CEO my entire life . Lilith , as someone who used to be friends with my mother , I ’d think you ’d have more respect for my choice of woman to settle down with . She would approve . ”“She
72243	72270	72272	72272	Frank	113	” Lilith said gently . Alex put his elbow on the table and stroked his hand over his mustache , probably to keep himself from interrupting . “And
72367	72382	72360	72360	I	0	”Reese straightened , buttoned his jacket , and scooped his phone off the table . “
72400	72434	72360	72360	I	0	”No one added anything , not even his father . Reese all but strutted from that room , mentally picturing his own mic drop . Merina would have been proud . * * * “
72441	72469	72360	72360	I	0	” Merina commented after Reese told her how far south the meeting had slipped . She opened a drawer , then another , then one after that . “
72476	72479	72360	72360	I	0	kitchen?”He shrugged . “
72483	72490	72360	72360	I	0	know?”She gave him a bland look . “Does
72496	72504	72360	72360	I	0	” He lifted his glass of scotch . “
72519	72527	72528	72529	his housekeeper	1507	Magda?”“Top left , next to the refrigerator , ”
72543	72550	72551	72551	he	113	“What are you doing , anyway ? ”
72560	72564	72537	72538	The woman	2305	“I’m making guacamole . ”“Why?”“Why
72570	72590	72602	72602	I	0	” She quit carving and gave him a confused , possibly miffed look . She was too damned attractive . “I
72630	72649	72650	72650	I	0	Magda?”Magda , who ’d known him nearly his entire life , smiled one of her supremely tolerant smiles . “
72680	72714	72654	72655	Mr. Crane	103	”He tilted his head and arched an eyebrow , hoping she read his silent communication to curb that discussion . Not that there was a need . Magda was n’t one to gossip . “Sometimes
72724	72744	72654	72655	Mr. Crane	103	” Merina said , halving the fruit … or was avocado a vegetable ? Something to ask Siri later . “But
72759	72763	72764	72764	I	0	” Reese said . “
72770	72813	72825	72825	Crane	101	”Merina shot him a glare , catching his intentional reference to the things he ’d like done to him . Things she did with her mouth and hands , involving her wearing a hell of lot less clothing than she was now . “You
72827	72839	72825	72825	Crane	101	” She pointed at him with the tip of the knife . “
72851	72884	72825	72825	Crane	101	”Magda chuckled and Merina smiled in triumph . He abandoned his scotch and stalked to his wife , lashing an arm around her middle and pressing her against the counter from behind . “What
72888	72921	72825	72825	Crane	101	” he rumbled into her ear . She smelled good today . She smelled good every day , but today there was something light and intoxicating about the fragrance on her neck . “
72923	72929	72958	72958	his	103	perfume?”“Yes , you bought it . ”“You’re
72932	72938	72939	72939	she	1512	”“No , you ’re welcome , ”
72942	72955	72956	72956	He	103	“Magda , I ’m going to need a moment with my wife . ”
73000	73008	73009	73009	he	103	“Second thought , take the evening off , ”
73022	73027	73028	73028	Magda	176	“Just like your parents . ”
73039	73043	73028	73028	Magda	176	“ Good night . ”That
73110	73112	73114	73114	his	103	“Why is it”—he
73117	73130	73114	73114	his	103	hers—“that when you sass me , all I want to do is fuck you?”Her
73208	73219	73195	73195	her	84	“ What did Magda mean we ’re like your parents ? ”
73239	73248	73230	73230	She	84	“ Tell me . I want to know . ”He
73280	73287	73288	73288	he	103	“Mom and Dad were a nightmare , ”
73293	73316	73288	73288	he	103	“ They were insanely in love , but in a house full of boys , the gross - out factor was high . “
73369	73376	73377	73377	She	84	”“So Magda means we ’re demonstrative . ”
73399	73402	73377	73377	She	84	“ Hmm . ”Hmm
73409	73411	73377	73377	She	84	“ fine ”
73413	73417	73377	73377	She	84	“ never mind . ”“She
73425	73442	73446	73446	she	84	then?”“Since I was ten . She was part - time then , raising her own kids . ”“I
73450	73457	73461	73461	you	84	” Merina said , eyes brightening . “I
73464	73474	73461	73461	you	84	” he said as Merina finished undoing his tie . “
73479	73497	73498	73498	parents	2608	” Merina unbuttoned his top button and then one more and stroked her fingers down his throat . “My
73510	73520	73521	73521	They	2608	” she said , continuing to drive him wild . “
73540	73552	73526	73526	I	0	” She screwed her face into a cute look of disgust . “
73555	73561	73526	73526	I	0	”“You are n’t missing out . ”
73584	73589	73580	73580	he	1522	“You’re good at that . ”
73595	73606	73590	73590	She	84	“ I guess you ’ve had a lot of practice . ”“A
73614	73617	73625	73625	she	84	”“Smart man . ”
73637	73644	73625	73625	she	84	“ Tell me about your mom . ”“Merina
73646	73665	73625	73625	she	84	” He backed away but she had a grip on his tie and he did n’t get far . “Other
73676	73681	73682	73682	He	1522	”“It ’s a yacht . ”
73712	73728	73746	73746	she	135	“How did she die ? I do n’t need gory details , just the facts . ”“You
73733	73738	73739	73739	she	135	know?”“How would I know ? ”
73818	73838	73808	73808	He	1522	“She was driving to work one day and was involved in a three - car pileup involving two semis . ”Merina
73856	73865	73848	73848	he	1522	“Hers was the compact car in the middle . ”“Reese
73867	73879	73881	73881	she	135	” She shook her head , pain searing her pretty face . “One
73914	73933	73903	73903	I	0	” He did n’t know if the position of his mouth was a sad smile or a grimace . “
73954	74030	73903	73903	I	0	”One of Merina ’s hands left his tie to cover her mouth . Something about her reaction — her shock , the pain in her eyes , the tenderness she showed him when she gently rested a palm on his chest — drew him in instead of pushing him away . The last five years had been about enjoying a woman ’s company for the short - term , and conversations rarely if ever veered into “
74036	74116	74193	74193	Your	1534	” territory . Keeping Merina at arm ’s length was something he ’d thought he could do , but that idea was becoming less and less desirable . The more she was around , the more he realized he liked talking to her . He moved her hair over one shoulder and stroked a finger over super - soft skin and along the collar of her shirt . Once there , he undid one of the delicate pearl buttons . “I
74122	74140	74193	74193	Your	1534	” Her eyes were glassy , her mind no doubt locked on the horrors he ’d described . “You
74156	74192	74193	74193	Your	1534	” He wanted to distract her . To erase her pain . Especially since it was for him . Seeing it sliced into him . Deep . He undid another button and parted her shirt . “
74196	74199	74200	74200	Distraught	228	”“My turn ? ”
74243	74250	74251	74251	He	2814	“You have a story , Merina . ”
74279	74288	74292	74292	Reese	101	“ Tell me . I ’ve earned it . ”
74315	74320	74321	74321	he	2814	“What ’s it mean ? ”
74341	74347	74328	74328	He	2814	“You would n’t appreciate it . ”
74373	74377	74362	74362	he	2814	“ fuck her . ”

74494	74503	74504	74504	she	1534	“I grew up in the Van Heusen hotel , ”
74508	74547	74504	74504	she	1534	“ Part - time . The VH was my home in a lot of ways . I played in the hallways , helped the housekeepers with laundry . Sat with Arnold for hours while he worked the desk . ”“The
74556	74564	74598	74598	he	2814	”“He ’s been there for years . The flames”—she
74580	74584	74598	74598	he	2814	full—“are a theme . ”His
74612	74615	74616	74616	He	2814	“The Phoenix . ”
74624	74632	74616	74616	He	2814	“ That building rose from the ashes . ”“Yes
74634	74645	74651	74651	he	2814	”“Did you rise from the ashes , too , Merina ? ”
74665	74669	74651	74651	he	2814	“In a way . ”
74703	74707	74714	74714	he	2814	“Why an arrow ? ”
74754	74760	74761	74761	she	1534	“It ’s a popular symbol , ”
74799	74811	74783	74783	He	2814	“I want to know what it means to you , Merina . ”
74846	74855	74829	74829	He	2814	“ Tell me , or I ’ll stop . ”His
74862	74864	74829	74829	He	2814	“Okay . ”
74914	74927	74928	74928	she	84	“An arrow … can only move forward … by being pulled back , ”
74943	74950	74928	74928	she	84	“ It ’s stronger for it . ”“You’re
74953	74979	74928	74928	she	84	” Mouth covering the pulse at her neck , he sucked her skin for a mind - melting second before speaking against her damp flesh . “
74985	75038	74928	74928	she	84	”Head lifted , he zoomed in on her again , and she squirmed . Not only from his sexual attention but also the way he seemed to see her in that moment . Like he was really seeing her . It made her feel more naked than when she was actually naked . “Not
75041	75053	74928	74928	she	84	” She jerked her eyes to another spot in the room . “
75059	75070	75076	75076	he	2814	”“The Van Heusen is more than a building to you . ”
75084	75092	75076	75076	he	2814	“Yes . Is n’t the Crane more to you?”His
75111	75115	75076	75076	he	2814	“ Not really . ”“You
75130	75138	75076	75076	he	2814	” She found that hard to believe . “No
75148	75165	75178	75178	his	2814	”“Because you ’d never bankrupt yourself and have to sell it to the local vultures who — ”
75217	75221	75229	75229	she	1537	“Stop teasing me . ”
75367	75370	75355	75355	She	1537	“You okay ? ”
75485	75487	75530	75530	She	1537	“Condom . ”He
75498	75500	75501	75501	He	2814	“Wallet . ”
75539	75548	75549	75549	she	1537	“I need to get back on the pill , ”
75557	75560	75561	75561	he	2814	“No shit , ”
75710	75712	75713	75713	she	1537	“Dangerous , ”
75786	75788	75789	75789	He	2814	“Merina . ”
75836	75839	75840	75840	She	1537	“I’m here . ”
76015	76020	76021	76021	she	84	“Oh , come on , ”
76044	76049	76030	76030	She	84	“What are you doing ? ”
76078	76081	76074	76074	she	84	“You are ! ”
76086	76091	76082	76082	She	84	“ Oh my God ! ”
76123	76128	76109	76109	He	2814	“Merina , stop it . ”But
76137	76139	76136	76136	his	2814	“ mad ”
76238	76240	76241	76241	he	2814	“Please , ”
76254	76257	76258	76258	Merina	84	“He begs , ”
76264	76270	76258	76258	Merina	84	“For the love of Christ ! ”
76339	76344	76336	76336	he	2814	“ You ’re impossible . ”“And
76349	76416	76336	76336	he	2814	” So damn proud of herself . He liked that look . Too much . Enough to want to see her proud of her accomplishments again . Would she feel that way when he handed over the Van Heusen ? Would she be proud she ’d earned it back at the cost of marrying him for a few soul - stealing months?The thought made him frown . “I’m
76420	76424	76336	76336	he	2814	” he argued . “
76432	76440	76441	76441	She	84	”“Did you just use the word postcoital ? ”
76479	76487	76441	76441	She	84	“You’d think after the counter , the kitchen chair”—her
76507	76527	76497	76497	Reese	101	ago—“then sliding me halfway across this ice - cold floor , you ’d have a dirtier word for it . ”“You’d
76535	76556	76497	76497	Reese	101	” he sneered , but secretly he admired her teasing tone as much as he ’d admired her puckering nipples . “I
76563	76567	76533	76533	you	84	” she said . “Fair
76570	76587	76590	76590	I	0	” He kept hold of her wrists and pulled her up so that she was sitting . “
76594	76666	76497	76497	Reese	101	” When he knew he could scramble away safely , he let her go . Then he stood and tore off the remainder of his suit . Once he was bare - assed naked and Merina had climbed to her feet , he lifted her into his arms . He carried her out of the kitchen , around to the back of the house , and into the enclosed pool room . “Hot
76669	76685	76497	76497	Reese	101	” she breathed . He put her down and opened the door to the enclosure . “Second
76692	76698	76497	76497	Reese	101	” The first being sex . “I
76706	76713	76497	76497	Reese	101	”We . Here came the feeling of “
76715	76720	76497	76497	Reese	101	” all over again . “You’re
76723	76866	76497	76497	Reese	101	” She lifted to her toes , sliding her body along the length of his , to put a soft kiss on his mouth . For a change he was n’t thinking of his dick or the fact that he ’d be between her legs soon . He was thinking of how he ’d pleased her . How she ’d referred to what they had together . The we could have been a slip of the tongue , and yeah , it was just a hot tub , but that implied co - ownership was something he had n’t experienced in … a while . Then she was off , strolling around the edge of the pool to the hot tub and stepping down into the square of hot water . He watched her curvy , naked body sink lower and lower . “Coming
76868	76887	76497	76497	Reese	101	” she called , not bothering to hide her breasts beneath the bubbles . God . This woman . “Hell
76890	76959	76497	76497	Reese	101	” he answered , trying to sound like his old cocky self and not like the unhinged sap he was turning into . He sank into the water . She glided over , breasts slicking over his chest , her leg rubbing his thigh . His dormant cock sprang to life . There . Good old - fashioned lust . That , he knew what to do with . “Your
76962	76980	76497	76497	Reese	101	” She did n’t finish her sentence , but she looked impressed with her mouth forming a little “
76981	76989	76990	76990	He	1551	O.”“Still ca n’t pay me a compliment ? ”
76993	77000	76990	76990	He	1551	“ After all we ’ve been through ”
77008	77014	77015	77015	she	1552	“You do n’t need one , ”
77031	77040	77015	77015	she	1552	“You’re right . I have my own hashtag . ”She
77083	77090	77091	77091	she	1552	“There ’s a bedroom over here , ”
77134	77155	77159	77159	his	1551	“ Why did n’t you choose this as the master suite ? It ’s huge and opens to the pool . ”His
77173	77181	77182	77182	he	1551	“ I used to sleep in there , ”
77347	77566	77340	77340	We	1556	” Reese grumbled , hands tightly wrapped around the steering wheel . He mumbled under his breath that he ’d rather stay home . When she ’d met Reese for the first time , Merina would ’ve concluded that this was him being a spoiled baby who did n’t want to drive outside the city to his father ’s house and deal with a cookout on a random June weekend . But knowing the man she shared a home with now , she did n’t think it was so simple . Like the night in the hot tub when she ’d pointed out the bedroom on the other side of the glass . He ’d walled up and fallen silent . She used to believe he was a one - ply , super absorbed a - hole . Now she saw he was more complicated , had more depth . Even a sense of humor , and dare she think it ? Feelings . Feelings she suspected were unresolved and maybe unexcavated in some circumstances . It ’s not your job to fix him . It was n’t . And it would do her good to remember that . She had practically felt him retreating from what would likely be a painful discussion . He’d never expounded on the “
77573	77676	77340	77340	We	1556	” but it was n’t hard to guess that he probably slept in that room with someone he ’d rather not talk about . Maybe several someones . Did n’t that thought make Merina ’s stomach twist . She’d called and talked to Lorelei about it , too afraid to text her in case the conversation was pinched and printed at the Spread , the latest gossip blog to pick up every bit of non - news about the new Cranes . Lore listened between bites of a rushed lunch before her next meeting . The conclusion they ’d arrived at was to “
77680	77808	77340	77340	We	1556	” much in the same vein of that overplayed song from Frozen , and so that ’s what Merina had done . Whatever lay behind his reasons for leaving the largest room with the best view in the house unoccupied were his and his alone . She ’d had to remind herself that more often than she liked . Today , though … today was a different beast , but possibly the same species . Pain waited for Reese at the end of this trip . It tightened his eyes and pulled at his firm mouth . He had n’t prepared for today emotionally , and had attempted to avoid it by going to work today even though he should have taken the day off . Men . “Great
77810	77862	77340	77340	We	1556	” he added at the end of his grumbling tirade as he parked at the end of a long driveway . Rows and rows of expensive , shiny cars — several of them convertibles — lined the massive parking area to the left of a large , three - story house . “
77885	78030	77880	77880	She	1397	”Well , this promised to be fun . Merina would have grabbed his tie to get his attention , but he was n’t wearing one . Reese was dressed in a casual collared shirt and khakis , and with the exception of hair to his elbows , closely resembled his brother Tag . In lieu of the aforementioned tie , she put her hand to his face and ran her fingers down the barely - there scruff that lined his sharp jaw . He held his frown , his eyes scrunched in frustration . She leaned closer and his expression softened , those scrunched eyes opening enough to dip and take inventory of her ample cleavage . She had gone with a summery turquoise dress that wrapped in the middle , low - cut enough to give the girls a day in the sun . “Your
78033	78059	77880	77880	She	1397	” He stroked the skin above her breast . Okay , so the cleavage was n’t front and center . He continued to surprise her . “Shit
78061	78076	77880	77880	She	1397	” She fussed with the material . That was the problem with this dress . “
78088	78093	78094	78094	Reese	101	”“Let them see it . ”
78099	78109	78094	78094	Reese	101	“ Let everyone see it . It ’s you . ”
78150	78158	78162	78162	her	1561	“ Let ’s get this over with . ”He
78205	78215	78216	78216	she	1561	“Who knew you had a thing for bad girls , ”
78234	78242	78216	78216	she	1561	“There ’s a first time for everything . ”
78461	78465	78466	78466	she	1561	“This is beautiful , ”
78469	78473	78466	78466	she	1561	“ And a pool house?”“Heated
78475	78478	78479	78479	father	348	”“Like yours . ”“Like
78497	78503	78483	78483	I	0	”She chewed on that thought . “
78509	78511	78512	78512	He	348	here?”“Yep . ”
78518	78531	78512	78512	He	348	“ Only house I ever lived in until I bought the estate . ”Interesting
78571	78591	78592	78592	she	1582	“Welcome to Big Crane ’s home . May I take your handbag and lock it in the private coatroom ? ”
78596	78600	78592	78592	she	1582	“Oh … sure . ”
78605	78608	78609	78609	he	348	“I’m Reese , ”
78612	78618	78626	78626	her	1582	“ You must be new . ”The
78633	78646	78609	78609	he	348	“ Mr. Crane ’s oldest son . You must be Merina Crane . ”Merina
78649	78653	78609	78609	he	348	“ I am . ”“I
78670	78681	78667	78668	Mr. Crane	103	” She handed Merina ’s purse off to an attendant . “
78694	78701	78702	78702	Reese	101	”“I can find it , thanks . ”
78708	78717	78702	78702	Reese	101	“ He goes through house staff like underwear . ”Merina
79043	79049	79050	79050	Merina	84	“This is a beautiful house , ”
79058	79061	79050	79050	Merina	84	“It was . ”
79378	79384	79385	79385	Alex	96	“Reese . There he is . ”
79412	79417	79418	79418	Reese	101	“Gang ’s all here , ”
79635	79637	79638	79638	Alex	96	“Frog , ”
79653	79669	79608	79609	His father	2387	“ Ca n’t pour the algae killer in there or else the frog will die . ”“Isn’t
79674	79718	79608	79609	His father	2387	” Reese asked drily , accepting the brew and tipping the bottle back for a long , wet sip . He ’d laid off the alcohol while wandering around the party , and now it tasted damn good going down . Alex chuckled . “
79722	79731	79816	79816	Reese	101	yourself?”Beer bottle to his lips , Reese grunted . “Penelope
79742	79755	79816	79816	Reese	101	” Alex lowered his voice , his eyes moving around the yard . “
79770	79774	79816	79816	Reese	101	”“You’re talking to my advisor?”“She
79781	79787	79819	79819	his	96	”“She ’s on my payroll . ”“I’m
79792	79799	79819	79819	his	96	” Alex broke into a grin . “
79807	79815	79816	79816	Reese	101	pants?”“You never did know how to relax . ”
79828	79838	79816	79816	Reese	101	“ Time to let yourself go . Get paunchy . ”“Shit
79840	79884	79816	79816	Reese	101	” Alex laughed the word . His old man deserved the break . After raising three boys alone — who’d grown into three hard - working , dedicated men — Alex deserved to kick back and not be responsible for anyone but himself . “I
79893	79916	79917	79917	You	2387	” Alex pulled a hand over his chest , his mustache stretching as he smiled . Reese nearly spit out his beer . “
79919	79929	79917	79917	You	2387	Date?”“Never know . I ’m hot for a senior . ”“And
79933	79981	79983	79983	you	2387	”His dad flipped him off and Reese laughed , which helped him relax . Alex had always , always been on Reese ’s side . Even when he became surly or short - tempered at work , there was nothing he would n’t do for his boys . “I
79985	79995	79997	79998	his father	2387	” Reese said , looking down at the grass . “For?”He
80009	80023	80030	80030	he	2387	“ For always making sure I knew that Crane Hotels was my destiny . ”Alex
80034	80050	80030	80030	he	2387	“You did n’t let me hand you anything , son . You demanded an interview . ”That
80054	80064	80030	80030	he	2387	“ I did n’t want to be handed anything . ”“So
80092	80116	80030	80030	he	2387	” Alex put a hand on Reese ’s shoulder and Reese felt the horrifying burn of tears at the back of his eyes . “
80121	80129	80130	80130	Reese	101	”“Who are all these people , anyway ? ”
80173	80175	80176	80176	Alex	96	“Filler , ”
80179	80191	80176	80176	Alex	96	“ So the board does n’t think this is a setup . ”“Penelope
80195	80199	80176	80176	Alex	96	” Reese guessed . “She
80203	80209	80213	80213	his	2387	Single?”“Don’t even think about it . ”Alex
80219	80230	80213	80213	his	2387	“ Ah , and here are the rest of them . ”Merina
80304	80309	80310	80310	Alex	96	“Better greet your outlaws , ”
80317	80332	80333	80333	His	2387	“ If you only win two people over today , it should be them . ”
80426	80430	80450	80450	Reese	101	“ for show , ”
80519	80525	80526	80526	she	84	“You did n’t tell me , ”
80546	80551	80552	80552	he	99	“I did n’t know , ”
80555	80558	80578	80578	Reese	101	“ Penelope . ”In
80647	80651	80637	80640	one of the flock	1662	“ leave and cleave ”
80710	80718	80719	80719	Jolie	91	“Well , this is quite the party , ”
80763	80767	80768	80768	Mark	126	“Hi , dear . ”
80774	80777	80768	80768	Mark	126	“ Reese . ”Reese
80841	80849	80850	80850	Merina	84	“I did n’t know you were coming , ”
80853	80868	80850	80850	Merina	84	“ I would have thought you ’d have mentioned it at work on Friday . ”“Well
80876	80880	80850	80850	Merina	84	” Jolie said . “I
80894	80898	80947	80947	his	126	” Mark stated . “About
80901	80915	80947	80947	his	126	” It had better not involve Reese ’s intentions or she ’d die . “Don’t
80918	80929	80947	80947	his	126	” Mark said with one of his calming Dad smiles . “
80939	80943	80944	80944	Reese	101	cigars?”“There are cigars , ”
80959	80967	80947	80947	his	126	“ I prefer business with my pleasure . ”His
81012	81026	81027	81027	Reese	101	“I’m sure you and your mom would like to eat while we talk , ”
81052	81065	81036	81036	He	126	“ If I do n’t come back in an hour , run . ”She
81105	81109	81110	81110	Merina	84	“We’ll be fine , ”
81118	81127	81128	81128	Reese	101	“Jolie , I highly recommend the artichoke dip , ”
81166	81170	81172	81173	your father	2345	“ What was that about?”“You
81181	81190	81175	81175	He	2345	” Jolie ’s expression was calm and accepting . “
81209	81782	81783	81783	you	1674	”More secrets . Merina put her arm in her mother ’s and led her to the chilled buffet bar on the patio , wishing she could tell her mother the truth about her and Reese . Though she was n’t sure what the truth was anymore . She ’d married him for ownership of the VH , but now she was enjoying the perks that came with their marriage . The biggest of which was Reese himself and who she was when she was with him . Later , Mark and Reese emerged with smiles and scotches in hand , and Jolie and Merina mingled with the various women present who either worked for Crane or were friends of the family . After her parents left , Tag arrived late , which was not surprising in the least . He nodded at Merina but beelined for his brother , and he and Reese hung at the bar on the patio . One by one , women turned their heads to take in so much sexy testosterone in a small space . Lights on strings and soft music playing through speakers had drawn the dwindling crowd to the patio . The board members had gone , and the remaining few consisted of Alex ’s family , his assistant , and another older couple . Tag and Reese were chatting so Merina made a trip to the bathroom , catching sight of a cozy side room on her way back . Curious , she veered into there instead of going outside right away . Too bright to be a den , the room featured a pair of French doors leading out to a flower garden with a bench in the center . The blooms were fresh , as if they were purchased recently , but for all Merina knew , Alex had a full - time gardener tending to every inch of this place . The house was spotless . There was n’t a twinkle of dust sitting on the shelves or the desk . She went to those shelves now , loaded mostly with picture frames , though a few books — fiction like Clancy and Patterson — stood off to the side . A box of cigars sat next to a small urn that read XAVIER CRANE , FATHER , SOLDIER.By the age of the photo , Merina guessed he was Alex ’s father , Reese ’s grandfather . She perused the pictures in the frames next . Various photos of the three boys fishing , or dressed for Halloween , or sitting at a picnic table eating slices of watermelon in the backyard . They were young , Reese probably only twelve or so . The only recent photos were one of Reese ’s corporate grimace , the same picture on the Crane Hotels website , and Tag ’s , though he was smiling . Eli ’s most recent photo was a military one . Him in front of a flag , clean - shaven , hair cropped beneath his hat . His mouth was n’t smiling and there was a hardness about him . She wondered when he ’d be on leave . If she ’d ever meet him . She abandoned the frames for the back doors , admiring the lush flowers and greenery . Night was falling , the sun dipping low and giving everything a grainy quality . “Are
81787	81825	81827	81827	Reese	101	” came a deep voice from behind her . Guiltily , Merina turned . Alex — hands in his pockets , reminding her of the way Reese stood most of the time — lingered in the doorway . “Sorry?”“Tag
81829	81839	81845	81845	them	1676	” He made a drinking motion with his hand . “
81847	81851	81840	81840	Sauced	240	”“That’s … unexpected . ”
81861	81864	81840	81840	Sauced	240	“ sauced . ”“Unless
81874	81880	81882	81882	I	0	”“Oh , um … okay . ”“Good
81887	81919	81882	81882	I	0	” Alex offered a genuine smile . Not a single part of him looked as if he was upset she ’d been snooping , but she had the urge to explain . “I’m
81937	81947	81948	81948	Alex	96	”“Ah . There are some good ones in here . ”
81954	81962	81963	81963	he	96	“ Arguably , Tag never grew up , ”
81971	81990	81991	81991	He	96	“ But , yeah , that ’s them when they were younger . That one is my favorite . ”
82049	82060	82061	82061	she	1682	“The yard has n’t changed much , but they have , ”
82085	82093	82094	82094	His	96	“Luna ’s death hit Reese the hardest . ”
82120	82130	82131	82131	she	1682	“Which of your sons looks the most like her ? ”
82164	82173	82174	82174	he	96	“This was a few years before she died , ”
82178	82182	82174	82174	he	96	“She ’s beautiful . ”
82198	82201	82183	82183	Merina	84	“ Reese . ”Alex
82220	82223	82183	82183	Merina	84	“ Tag . ”She
82227	82232	82183	82183	Merina	84	“Eli has her sensitivity . ”“A
82234	82237	82238	82238	Alex	96	marine?”“We exist , ”
82256	82264	82247	82247	He	96	“ Reese does n’t like being here . ”“I
82267	82299	82300	82300	he	96	”“Maybe because he ’s the oldest and knew her longer , or maybe because I handled things better with Tag and Eli . Either way , he prefers not to visit . ”“But
82307	82311	82303	82303	he	96	” Merina said . “He
82317	82327	82303	82303	he	96	” Alex ’s dark blue eyes trained on hers . “
82336	82339	82381	82381	Alex	96	you?”“I will . ”He
82346	82375	82381	82381	Alex	96	“ I ’ll make a phone call to Magda to let her know you ’re staying . Have her drop a change of clothes for each of you . ”Wow
82393	82406	82388	82388	he	96	“Magda knows him . Loves him . She looks out for him . ”
82415	82435	82437	82437	his	96	“ When Reese bought his house , I sent her there to work for him . And let me tell you”—he
82440	82450	82452	82452	I	0	earnest—“I did not want to give up those tamales . ”“Oh
82462	82527	82452	82452	I	0	” They shared a smile and she realized this was the first lengthy conversation she ’d had with Alex . From afar he ’d seemed both serious and cunning , but it turned out he had a lot of warmth . Like the way Reese ’s charm had been buried beneath his surly exterior . How much more could she unearth in her time with him?“He
82535	82579	82611	82611	you	176	” Alex said . His love for his sons was genuine . Strong . He was a man who ’d do anything for them . She wondered if his idea to retire had anything to do with ushering Reese in sooner than later . “Since
82587	82596	82611	82611	you	176	” Alex asked , heading for the door . “Always
82600	82606	82611	82611	you	176	” she said , following . “You
82615	82626	82611	82611	you	176	” Alex offering an arm and together they rejoined the party .
82726	82728	82712	82712	Her	84	“Chardonnay , ”
82898	82901	82902	82903	The waitress	1487	“Excuse me . ”
82913	82919	82902	82903	The waitress	1487	“ I know this is really inappropriate”—she
82925	82940	82902	82903	The waitress	1487	continuing—“but is there any way you could introduce me to the guy with the long hair?”“You
82946	82982	82902	82903	The waitress	1487	” Merina ’s eyebrows went up in surprise . The other woman had to be at least twenty - one to serve the drinks , so at least they were in the safe zone there . “I
82990	83007	82902	82903	The waitress	1487	” She bit her lip and gazed over at Tag , hearts blooming in her eyes . “
83019	83071	83016	83016	I	0	”Tag was laughing , Adam ’s apple bobbing . His casual button - up shirt was open one more button than necessary , revealing the top of his golden chest . His hair was down and ran over his shoulders , his beard proving he had no problem growing body hair . “He
83076	83164	83165	83165	Merina	84	” Merina said as the waitress , still staring , gave a mute nod . But when Merina ’s eyes tracked to Reese , leaning back , feet crossed at the ankles and his hand gripping the arm of the deck chair , her mouth watered and heart stuttered . If that was anywhere near the way this sweet college - aged girl saw Tag , then she was right . Hell yeah , he ’d be worth it . How long would she have the dumb job anyway?“I’m
83167	83171	83165	83165	Merina	84	” she introduced . “Taylor
83173	83189	83165	83165	Merina	84	” Her dark eyes swept over to Tag and she sighed with longing . Adorable . “You’ve
83199	83205	83206	83206	She	84	it?”“Oh , yeah . But … ”
83218	83226	83206	83206	She	84	“ I ’ve never talked to him . ”Maybe
83260	83269	83248	83248	she	84	“Lucky for you , I know him well . ”
83281	83282	83285	83285	her	84	“ Ready?”Taylor
83289	83292	83285	83285	her	84	“ Ready . ”
83296	83301	83302	83302	Reese	101	“ You baited him , ”
83455	83461	83462	83462	Merina	84	“I did n’t bait him , ”
83465	83482	83462	83462	Merina	84	“ I made an introduction . Taylor wanted to know what kind of shampoo he used . ”
83503	83505	83494	83494	Magda	176	“Baited . ”
83565	83573	83574	83574	He	246	“Did she put my mouthwash in there ? ”
83586	83591	83592	83592	She	84	“Yes , Your Highness . ”
83697	83701	83702	83702	Merina	84	“That was brief , ”
83728	83732	83733	83733	He	246	“What was brief ? ”
83739	83743	83733	83733	He	246	“Your light mood . ”
83834	83842	83819	83819	He	246	“Softest fucking skin I ’ve ever felt . ”
83866	83868	83869	83869	she	84	“Ever ? ”
83896	83898	83899	83899	He	246	“Ever . ”
83908	83913	83919	83919	his	246	“What’d you and Dad talk about?”He
83922	83935	83919	83919	his	246	“ We ’re not talking about family while I ’m seducing you . ”“I’m
83943	83950	83919	83919	his	246	” Her eyes widened in alarm . “
83957	83969	83919	83919	his	246	”“Actually , this one was Eli ’s , so no worries . ”“That
83973	83982	83983	83983	I	0	” She gave his arm a playful slap . “
83990	84061	83983	83983	I	0	”Reese ’s shoulders stiffened . Would Merina ever meet him ? Unlikely . Eli was n’t due back soon . He e - mailed and called every few months , but by the time he came home , Merina would be out of Reese ’s life . Permanently , he imagined . He did n’t see how they ’d remain friends . A sudden surge of melancholy made him frown . “I
84071	84104	83983	83983	I	0	” He smoothed his hands over her shoulders and pushed the dress off her body . Lace panties matched her bra . He plucked one of the little black bows decorating them . “
84114	84120	84105	84105	I	0	”“I ca n’t ask about my parents—”“Nope
84122	84128	84105	84105	I	0	” He kissed her neck . “—or
84132	84181	84105	84105	I	0	” Her fingers in his hair sent a surge of warmth through his limbs . This was working . Under the attention of his fingers and his mouth she caved every time . She trusted him enough to let down her guard , which made him uncharacteristically humble . “Correct
84183	84197	84105	84105	I	0	” He placed an openmouthed kiss on the top side of one breast . “Share
84201	84209	84105	84105	I	0	” she gasped , gripping his hair . “Always
84211	84238	84105	84105	I	0	” He tugged the cup of her bra down and pulled her nipple into his mouth , the word echoing in his head . With Merina , “
84240	84243	84105	84105	I	0	” only meant “
84246	84341	84105	84105	I	0	” and he did n’t want to think about how soon the end would come . * * * Merina toweled off , Reese next to her doing the same . They shared an almost shy smile , which was insane considering what had happened under the spray . He ’d stripped them both naked , then hustled her into the smallish stand - up shower in the corner of the room . After doing a thorough job of soaping and rinsing her into a heated frenzy , he ’d shut off the water . “We
84347	84357	84105	84105	I	0	” she said , but she barely meant it . “Oh
84364	84481	84105	84105	I	0	” He was damned attractive with his damp hair sticking up from running a towel haphazardly over the strands . His chest was bare and glistening with droplets of water . Between a pair of strong thighs , his cock hung heavily , tempting her in a million different ways . Sex with Reese was so many things . Fun . Fantastic . Mind - erasing . But the idea of being in bed with him while his family was in the house — his brother , his father … Merina was supposed to be pretending to be wifely , not actually doing the wifely things with him . Or sordid , wicked things with him . “You’re
84487	84521	84105	84105	I	0	” he growled , and she realized her eyes were glued to his impressive manhood and that it ’d grown even more impressive now that her teeth were resting on her bottom lip . “I’m
84524	84558	84105	84105	I	0	” She tracked her eyes up his body and met his navy gaze . He took a step closer , steam rolling around them , and speared his fingers into her wet hair . “
84562	84654	84105	84105	I	0	” He kissed her gently , pushing his tongue past her lips to tangle with hers . He backed them from the bathroom to the bedroom , the moonlight arcing across the floor lighting their way . His moves were familiar . He had a pattern of seduction and she played into it like a well - rehearsed dance . And right now he was doing one of her favorite things : raking his whiskered chin over her sensitive skin as he left a trail of damp kisses on her neck . “Have
84661	84704	84706	84706	I	0	” he mumbled against her mouth . He tasted of scotch and spice and she could swear she was getting drunk off his tongue . He dropped her to the bed and laid over her , pressing his erection into her thigh . “Who
84714	84726	84706	84706	I	0	” She cupped one of his rock - hard ass cheeks . “Your
84732	84774	84775	84775	You	1725	” He dragged his tongue over one breast and Merina ’s back arched . When he sucked her nipple into his mouth , heat weaved down her spine . Taking his time , he dragged his tongue to her other breast . “
84788	84817	84775	84775	You	1725	”He continued torturing her , suckling her deeply as warmth flooded between her legs . She hissed , pushing him away when she could n’t stand another second . “Really
84821	84825	84775	84775	You	1725	” she conceded . “The
84833	84860	84831	84831	you	1725	” he said , lifting an eyebrow . Eyes on her , he moved from her breasts to her ribs , down to — Oh no … “No
84864	84879	84831	84831	you	1725	” She clasped his head when he ran his tongue over her belly button . “Yes
84881	84903	84831	84831	you	1725	” He nipped and licked where her thigh met her … Oh , God . He was going to kill her . “Reese
84907	84911	84831	84831	you	1725	” she pled . “
84925	85028	84917	84917	I	0	”An evil glint in his eyes , he lifted and dropped one eyebrow before slicking her center with his tongue . Her pushing hands turned into kneading , threading his soft hair between her fingers . She steered his mouth where she wanted as he laved her again and again . He continued sending ripples of delight through her until she clutched and came on a quiet whimper . He climbed her body , placing kisses here and there until he was lying on the pillow next to her . Content , she rolled over and rested her chin on his chest . “Nice
85040	85067	85031	85031	I	0	” he said with a lazy , pleased smile . She smiled back at him , the light from the moon slanting across his bare chest . “Well
85090	85099	85069	85069	I	0	”“Ugh . I ca n’t think about it . ”He
85179	85189	85190	85190	Merina	84	“So what did you and Dad decide , again ? ”
85212	85218	85219	85219	he	109	“That ’s between us men , ”
85227	85244	85219	85219	he	109	“Reese!”“I made him promise not to tell your mother or you and then we drank scotch . ”She
85247	85256	85257	85257	He	109	“Why do you care what we talked about ? ”
85262	85268	85269	85269	he	109	“ Afraid he asked me about you?”“Did
85271	85333	85257	85257	He	109	” There was a mortifying thought . She did n’t think her father would ask Reese to divorce her to give her a chance at finding a husband who loved her , but what if he had ? What if Mark saw right through them?How can he ? Even you ca n’t see where the fake stops and the real begins . “We
85344	85356	85357	85357	you	1735	” He touched the tip of her nose with his finger . “Do
85366	85382	85357	85357	you	1735	” she asked , wondering if they ’d done a good job at convincing them . “Worried
85390	85405	85386	85388	the Van Heusen	84	” It was a fair question since that ’s what she stood to gain . “You
85407	85411	85412	85412	He	1735	CEO.”“I’ll get it . ”
85423	85428	85412	85412	He	1735	“ Do n’t worry . ”“One
85432	85455	85412	85412	He	1735	” Because he had n’t answered any of them to her satisfaction yet . He blinked his eyes slowly , clearly tired . “
85460	85487	85412	85412	He	1735	”She took a breath and asked the question she ’d wondered about since the night of the retirement party . It came out as a demand . “
85495	85502	85493	85493	Gwyneth	153	”His fingers stilled in her hair . “I
85532	85540	85541	85541	Reese	101	did?”“I’m not talking about this , Merina . ”
85563	85572	85552	85552	she	101	“You force me to draw my own conclusions . ”His
85595	85610	85617	85617	His	198	“ After a torrid threesome , you became insanely jealous because Hayes was much better at—”Reese
85656	85663	85648	85648	he	198	“It ’s not nearly that adventurous . ”
85761	85766	85767	85767	he	198	“It ’s old news , ”
85777	85786	85767	85767	he	198	“ But if you really want to know … ”“I
85789	85853	85855	85855	I	0	” She shifted on his chest , pillowy breasts on his ribs , her comforting weight against his bare skin . What was it about her that made him able to tell her things he swore never to talk about?He could do this . He just had to stick to the facts , spit it out , and then it ’d be done . “Gwyneth
85878	85972	85873	85873	she	2987	” All true . The socialite in her wanted to maintain her status , increase her position in the years to come . Her mother had taught her well . In Reese she ’d seen opportunity and nothing more . He just had n’t been privy to her plan until she fucked his best friend . Loving someone who did n’t love him had hurt like a bitch . He ’d attempted to ignore it , to anesthetize the pain by pretending it was n’t there . But the numbness always wore off . “The
85977	85984	85873	85873	she	2987	” he said with forced boredom , “
86011	86018	86043	86043	She	1740	”Money . Jewelry . His heart . “She
86024	86037	86038	86039	the man	368	” Merina ’s fingers moved soothingly over his skin , grounding him . “I’m
86055	86062	86043	86043	She	1740	”She let him have the deflection . “Did
86067	86133	86063	86063	you	0	” she asked . Four years was a long time . Age twenty - four to twenty - eight for him , and while they were n’t formative years , they were the years he ’d started to discover who he was , who he would become . But that fell under the category of sharing far too much , so he shrugged and said , “
86137	86143	86144	86144	she	1741	”“A month ? A year ? ”
86147	86152	86153	86153	he	368	“A handful of months , ”
86225	86262	86210	86210	He	368	“ I learned a lesson I needed to learn , and she moved on to greener pastures . Hayes was an up - and - comer , or was until he was fired from Crane Hotels . ”“Scandal
86264	86274	86210	86210	He	368	” Merina whispered , trying to lighten the mood . “Not
86277	86375	86376	86376	she	1747	” That was a flat - out lie . He ’d felt scandalized . Used . Pissed . Hurt . All at once and in overwhelming equal measures . He moved Merina ’s hair from her forehead , admiring her beauty and the honesty brimming in her eyes . Since she ’d met him , she ’d been lying to everyone she cared about — and to people she did n’t . It did n’t escape him that he ’d given her little to no choice in the matter . It bothered him now more than before . “Is
86390	86590	86595	86596	a woman	2448	” Merina blinked sweetly , teasing him , which he appreciated . She did n’t want to see him hurting . Good thing she could n’t read his mind because a large part of him was hurting for her ; for what he ’d done to her . He wanted Merina to believe that Gwyneth had stung his ego , not demolished his ability to commit to someone . And really , he could n’t give Gwyneth that much credit . He ’d made a series of choices after she left — purposeful decisions with an end goal in mind . Plus , if anyone had kept him from settling down , he could lay that blame at his mother ’s feet . Her death had practically inoculated him . Whatever he had with Merina , he was grateful the end date was on the horizon . The hurt he ’d feel letting her go as planned would be easier than learning she ’d left him or never loved him or died . That thought did n’t do much to settle him . No relief came from imagining himself in bed alone , no Merina draped over his body . “It
86601	86629	86595	86596	a woman	2448	” Reese answered belatedly . He brushed her cheek with the back of his knuckle . She was achingly beautiful , her eyes warm in the moonlight . “
86648	86651	86595	86596	a woman	2448	”She hummed . “
86671	86682	86664	86664	I	0	”He laughed , and some of that coveted relief came . “
86742	86759	86734	86734	you	0	” he added , air quoting the words she ’d said to him when he proposed , “
86774	86792	86793	86795	a good person	1755	”The corner of her mouth curved and he touched her smile with the tip of his finger . “You’re
86799	86812	86793	86795	a good person	1755	” In the silence of the room , he counted her heartbeats . “You’re
86825	86834	86823	86823	Reese	101	” she said , her honesty flooring him . “
86845	86966	86836	86836	I	0	”He liked her more than was healthy . He liked her in his bed . He liked her swathed over his chest . He liked her in the wrapped dress and especially out of it . He liked her way more than he ’d anticipated . Essentially , that was the problem , was n’t it?He’d vowed to never take a woman to bed more than once after Gwyneth destroyed everything between them . He ’d talked himself into the idea that Merina was just a long one - night stand . But he ’d shared things with her he ’d never shared with one - night stands . They were in his childhood home , for God ’s sake . “Hey
86968	87082	86836	86836	I	0	” She put her finger on his chin to turn his face to hers . When their eyes locked , he had a premonition . It had claws . Fangs . It was one word with seven letters . FOREVER.Forever was a myth . Always was n’t real . His future was CEO and eighty - hour weeks and living on the same floor of his office at Crane Hotel . What he had with Merina was … Ah , fuck . He could n’t categorize it and he was n’t sure if it was because he did n’t want to or because he already knew and did n’t want to admit it . “I
87087	87096	86836	86836	I	0	” she murmured , interrupting his hectic thoughts . “
87100	87167	87170	87170	Crane	101	”His heart rapped a hectic beat . Try as he might to ignore it , he could n’t escape the idea that in the last ten seconds things between them had changed irrevocably . He liked her a lot too . A whole damn lot . She shifted from his chest to her pillow , and side by side , they looked up at the ceiling . “Good
87172	87177	87170	87170	Crane	101	”“Good night , Merina . ”They
87808	87811	87797	87797	Taylor	246	“ thank you ”

87935	87953	87954	87954	Merina	84	” Tag answered . He slid a knowing glance first at Reese , then back to her . “
87962	88009	87954	87954	Merina	84	”He grinned and her cheeks grew hot . Reese did n’t hide his own smile as he crossed the room , rounded the counter , and refilled his mug . He placed the coffee in front of her and she stepped forward to grasp the handle . “And
88019	88030	88032	88032	you	1798	” Tag said , getting himself a glass of water . “How
88039	88079	88032	88032	you	1798	” Merina asked , desperate for a subject change . She hoped Tag had n’t overheard her and Reese last night . Then again , how could he have overheard anything but what he and Taylor had been doing ? “
88085	88090	88091	88091	Tag	109	used?”“Trust me , Sis . ”
88103	88126	88093	88093	his	109	“ She ’s going back to Berkeley in a few weeks . She does n’t want anything more than I gave her . ”“Which
88133	88147	88149	88149	I	0	” Merina asked with a sweet smile . Reese choked on a laugh . “Hey
88154	88158	88149	88149	I	0	” Tag straightened . “
88178	88205	88168	88168	you	1799	” A hoisted golden - brown eyebrow suggested Tag knew how things had gone down . Which meant Taylor probably , definitely did not feel used . “
88225	88227	88228	88228	Reese	101	”“Don’t . ”

90168	90174	90192	90192	he	253	“You’re very hands - on . ”She
90182	90190	90192	90192	he	253	“ Which you have enjoyed many times . ”Not
90284	90292	90293	90293	Her	84	“Don’t go mushy on me , Crane . ”

90373	90396	90398	90398	her	84	“ Tell me , Merina . Have you ever harbored a fantasy about having sex with the CEO of Crane Hotels in his office?”She

90524	90527	90512	90512	She	84	“They are . ”
90557	90563	90544	90544	he	253	“ Bobbie , go home . ”“Yes
90567	90572	90608	90608	you	84	” came her reply . “I
90585	90598	90616	90616	her	84	” Merina ’s eyebrows rose in challenge when he returned to her . “We
90609	90612	90613	90613	She	84	think?”“I do . ”
90698	90701	90702	90702	she	84	“Tell me , ”
90711	90728	90702	90702	she	84	“ Are you the one with the fantasy of having sex as CEO of Crane Hotels ? ”
90737	90739	90729	90729	She	84	“Definitely . ”
90745	90783	90705	90705	her	84	“I wo n’t ask if you ’ve ever had sex in this office because I do n’t want to know . I could still be your first as the man in charge , which counts for something . ”“It
90791	90805	90705	90705	her	84	” He could tell by her relaxed expression she liked being his first . “
90817	90823	90824	90824	My	0	” He unclasped her bra . “
90829	90838	90824	90824	My	0	” Her eyelids narrowed , so he added , “
90843	90869	90824	90824	My	0	” He dragged the bra off her arms , sliding his fingertips along her skin and watching as her nipples pebbled in the cool air . “
90871	91027	90824	90824	My	0	first—”She caught his mouth to stop his words and he was glad , because he was n’t sure what would have followed those words . Soon there was pulling and tugging , unbuttoning and unzipping . He closed his lips over her breast as she stroked him into a fevered frenzy . Whatever happened between them , he ’d forever have this memory . Pain shot through his heart . He did n’t like thinking of her as a memory . She was his for now , and that ’s where he ’d stay . If they were creating a memory , he ’d create one she would n’t soon forget . He spun her so she faced the windows . Mirrored , no one was seeing in , but she never brought it up . Either she trusted him or simply did n’t care if anyone looked . Both of those worked for him . “Beautiful
91029	91050	90824	90824	My	0	” he murmured against her ear , watching as he cupped her breasts in the reflection . She arched seductively . “
91054	91107	90824	90824	My	0	”Her eyes opened and clashed with his . Night had fallen and dots of light from neighboring office windows created a faux sea of stars . They stood at his desk , bared completely . He put a kiss on her shoulder , then bent to retrieve a condom from his wallet . “Hurry
91109	91114	90824	90824	My	0	” came her plea . “Moving
91123	91268	91121	91121	honey	952	” He felt her pain . He was n’t drawing out the anticipation of any longer . They needed this — needed to celebrate how far they ’d come . Hell . He needed her , period . She bent , hands on top of his desk , ass in the air . He reached for her hips , the tip of his cock stroking her slick folds . She was wet and ready . He traced the delicate line of her back with his fingertips . Her hair fell over smooth shoulders when she lifted her chin . He memorized her like this — eyes closed , elbows on the desk , breasts full . She opened her eyes and her smoky , fuzzy twin had matching lust in her eyes . Tilting his hips , he entered her and a sharp shout of “
91270	91275	91276	91276	me	0	” left her lips . “Tell
91281	91301	91276	91276	me	0	” He gripped her tightly , unwilling to let her give him more before taking what she came for . “This
91303	91313	91314	91314	You	0	” she said . He slid into her again . “
91316	91336	91314	91314	You	0	”He repeated the movement , hands wrapped around her hips as he drove her back against his thighs again . “You
91338	91391	91393	91393	Reese	101	” she gasped . She needed him . Those words wound around and tickled a part of him he was desperately trying to ignore . The part of him that knew he was n’t what Merina should need . She grasped his hand when he slowed down , and issued another command . “Harder
91395	91400	91393	91393	Reese	101	” Her reflection smiled . “
91411	91620	91403	91403	you	101	”That , he could oblige . Holding her , he pounded them both into oblivion , his mind buried under the sensation of her tight warmth and the sweet sounds of her release . She was shouting now , his name , the word yes and oh God and a please thrown in for good measure . If he could have gotten his tongue to work , he ’d have shouted with her . Merina knocked a stapler and the contents of his inbox to the floor , throwing her head to the side in a gorgeous display of ecstasy . One that accompanied her inner muscles spasming . Reese was caught , trapped there within her . As she took her orgasm , she drew his from him . He came hard , so hard he had to bend over her to rest a hand on the desk , the other cupping her ass as he finished with a few final pumps . Chin on her back , he lightly scraped her flesh with his teeth . She sighed , contented . For several minutes the only sound in the room was hectic breathing . Until Merina cut in with that droll , joking tone of hers . “
91630	91668	91403	91403	you	101	”He drew out of her , slowly , and discarded the condom in the wastebasket under his desk . That ought to be fun for the cleaning staff . Merina began collecting her clothes from the floor . “Going
91671	91688	91728	91728	He	1867	” He took the panties and bra from her hands and threw them on his desk . “I
91700	91702	91703	91703	He	1867	”“Soon . ”
91749	91753	91728	91728	He	1867	“What ’s this ? ”
91868	91871	91863	91863	he	1867	“Thank you . ”A
91877	91883	91863	91863	he	1867	“ You ’re thanking me for sex?”“No
91889	91904	91863	91863	he	1867	” he said , and that earned him the cocksure tilt of her mouth . “
91914	91930	91905	91905	I	0	” Her smile turned to a cute laugh . He gave her a brief kiss . “
91940	91942	91943	91943	Her	1867	”“Oh . ”
91950	91962	91963	91963	he	1867	“I held the VH over your head because I needed this , ”
91966	91971	91963	91963	he	1867	“ I needed you … ”
91992	92036	92037	92037	He	1867	“ I needed you , Merina . I ’ve wanted CEO for as long as I can remember . Crane Hotels is in my blood . This company is my lifeline , my legacy . If Crane Hotels had gone to someone else … ”
92042	92049	92037	92037	He	1867	“ It ’s my worst nightmare . ”His
92082	92100	92067	92067	Merina	84	“I used to see Crane Hotels as big and impersonal . Cold without personality . Like you . ”“Ouch
92102	92106	92067	92067	Merina	84	” He winced . “I
92116	92129	92067	92067	Merina	84	” Her lips pursed in humility as she glanced around the room . “
92174	92181	92182	92182	You	1867	” She stroked his hair again . “
92194	92215	92182	92182	You	1867	”Just like she ’d done for her hotel . Another thing they had in common . She palmed his cheek . “
92221	92240	92182	92182	You	1867	”He accepted another kiss and sank down onto the couch , comfortable with her on top of him . “Was
92250	92265	92182	92182	You	1867	” he asked as her hands wandered over his chest and down his torso . “Sex
92270	92281	92267	92268	the CEO	1880	” She palmed his erection and his mouth fell open . “
92287	92425	92267	92268	the CEO	1880	”Like everything with her . Merina was better than he ’d ever imagined . Better at handling his ex . Better at taking things in stride . Better at knowing what he needed — knowing when to forgive him . Soon , her kisses turned hungry and his hands wandered to the space between her legs . Minutes after that , she was under him and he driving into her once again . Her eyes on his , he lost himself in their amber depths , thanking her with more than just his words . With nothing to prove and nothing between them but a thin layer of latex , Reese took his time . Her orgasm came in gentle waves , her eyebrows pinching over her nose and her swollen mouth open and saying his name . “Oh
92432	92437	92440	92440	Reese	101	” Eyes on his . “
92444	92688	92440	92440	Reese	101	”Because he liked hearing that , and seeing her come apart beneath him , he held on until he was fairly certain he ’d given her two — maybe three — more , before letting himself go . When he let go , he pressed his mouth over hers and drank her in , even as he lost himself in her body , his mind a tapestry of pleasure . * * * Merina was chewing on the side of her finger , eyes on her computer , mind turning over the image on the screen . What she ’d meant to do was peek at the article , close the website , then shrug it off as no big deal . For she was a strong , independent woman who was very much in charge of her faculties . Instead , she was staring at an image of Reese that was seven or eight years old and feeling a sharp pain in the center of her chest . Like now , in the photo he was devastatingly attractive . He was bare - chested , possibly naked , and lying on a pile of stark white bedding . His grin was infectious and achingly happy , his eyes bright in the sunlight streaming in from behind him . Seeing it — knowing where it came from — was just plain heartbreaking . Penelope Brand had texted her this morning and let her know “
92694	93510	92440	92440	Reese	101	” that Gwyneth Sutton Lerner had hopped onto Twitter the night before and posted the photo with Reese ’s infamous hashtag ( thankfully , that particular part of his anatomy was not featured ) , as well as one of her own choosing : # Loveofmylife . By lunch , the tweet had been deleted , and Penelope had guessed that Gwyneth was drunk when she posted it , or at the very least pissed off at Hayes for whatever reason and seeking revenge . But nothing on the Internet ever truly went away , even after the delete button was pushed . It made Merina think back to Alex ’s retirement party when Gwyneth had scuttled over to Reese and Merina had wanted nothing more than to go pry them apart . The Spread had snagged a snapshot of the tweet and splashed it onto their column . Penelope ’s phone call had also included some additional unpleasant news : the television show Inside Edition had called for an official comment , which Penelope had denied them . Which meant she expected the photo , paired with a whooshing sound effect , to be featured alongside Gwyneth ’s tweets tonight . Understanding that this was yet another of Reese ’s conquests who had a thorn in her side — one who ’d lobotomized her brain since tweeting an old intimate photo was the height of stupidity — Merina fully expected to continue with her day like nothing happened . That was twenty minutes ago . Initially , she did scoff and close the window , but working was impossible when she kept seeing that photo on the screen of her distracted mind . So she found it and opened it again in her phone . Then she opened it on her computer screen so she could see it bigger . The part carving out a tiny piece of her soul was the expression on Reese ’s face . So light , happy , carefree . A good five minutes into staring at the smile lines bracketing his mouth — the mouth she ’d kissed repeatedly — she finally put her finger on what was bothering her . Reese had let someone into his heart , and that person had been Gwyneth . The woman he ’d played off like she was no big deal , when clearly , the look on his face in this picture had BIG DEAL written all over it . When she ’d asked if Gwyneth had been the one responsible for him sleeping with all of Chicago , she ’d been joking . Now she could n’t bring herself to laugh . The look on his face — that was a man in love . Which meant Gwyneth had meant something to him and had left him heartbroken . At his parents ’ house , at his office when she ’d taken him the framed article , Merina had thought she ’d seen him open up . There had been a few moments of stark connection , where she could swear she ’d seen in his eyes how much she ’d come to mean to him . Things had been so , so good . Reese coming home from work , practically skipping because of his newfound position . Merina could n’t be anything less than happy for him , because she thought she ’d understood . She thought she ’d finally uncovered the man who had hidden from her — peeled back one of his final layers . Gwyneth ’s photo of Reese proved Merina had n’t scratched the surface . Because she was obsessed , she went to the Spread ’s blog ( after swearing for months she would n’t read that garbage ) and read every word of what they reported . Including something that made her feel even worse about the current state of affairs . As far as the Spread can tell , this picture of Reese ( sans rocket , boo - hoo ! ) was taken when he was at the ripe and sexy age of twenty - four . We had to dig through the archives , but our sleuths here uncovered a few early photos of this couple . It seems their four - year affair ended suddenly ( even scandalously ! ) since Gwyneth was photographed with Hayes shortly after her and Reese ’s appearance at an art show in downtown Chicago . We reached out to Gwyneth Sutton Lerner as well as Reese Crane for comment but have n’t heard back yet . We ’ll let you know as soon as we do!Four years . Four . Years . It was the only thing Merina could focus on . She ’d asked Reese how long he and Gwyneth had dated and he ’d brushed it off with an evasive “
93516	93864	94107	94107	she	0	” It was n’t that she was upset he ’d lied to her . It was why he ’d lied to her . Why had n’t he told her the truth ? Why did he lie , play Gwyneth down ? Was he trying to protect Merina from the truth … or worse ? Trying to hide how much he still loved Gwyneth Sutton Lerner … Her heart hit her throat and she swallowed around it , choking back the urge to burst into tears . After all Merina and Reese been through together , he had n’t trusted her with the truth . After she ’d put herself — her heart — on the line , he ’d lied to her . This had happened once before — with Corbin . Lorelei had insisted that Reese was not Corbin . In many cases , he was n’t . But that chickenshit move to dodge instead of manning up and telling her the truth had proven one thing . Reese had kept his distance , while she ’d been trying to erase it . * * * Today was n’t going smoothly . Pure adrenaline paired with excitement over his new position last week led to an overwhelming need to put his fist through a wall this week . Work was busy , which he enjoyed , but the level of stupidity he was currently wrangling bordered on criminal . After handling a board of directors meeting without his father or Tag , Reese realized his biggest challenge with them would be keeping from hurling one of them down the elevator shaft . Which was n’t a good idea , though it would make him feel better . Bobbie had called in sick , probably for the first time since she ’d started working for him , so he ’d left the phone messages unchecked . He was n’t retrieving them and sure as shit did n’t have time to deal with a temp . Penelope Brand had texted , then called , then texted again to say “
93870	94061	94107	94107	she	0	” ; all of this he ’d registered while sitting across from Ingrid Belter . Ingrid was a powerful woman who held the keys to the city of Austin , where he was currently working with her to open two new hotels . And he would n’t undermine her or their meeting to answer Penelope . Pen worked for him , not the other way around , and did a damn good job of panicking often and early . Once Ingrid was on a plane back to Texas , Reese finished up what he could for the day , ignoring the belligerent red light blinking on Bobbie ’s desk . Even if he did know how to tap into voice mail , he was far too spent to go through dozens or hundreds — who knew how many of them Bobbie handled that he never saw?—of messages . He climbed onto the elevator and by the time he hit the lobby , his phone gave an insistent ring . Penelope . Again . He should have remembered what curiosity did to the proverbial cat before he hit the ANSWER button . “What

94924	94938	94880	94880	you	1901	” she answered truthfully . One of them may as well be honest . “
94945	95029	94880	94880	you	1901	” In the end , she could n’t lay herself open . She let her voice trail off . Her eyes had adjusted to the dark , though there was enough ambient light — some from the gardens surrounding the house , most from the interior of the mansion — so that it was n’t pitch black . Reese remained quiet . Evidently , he was n’t going to broach the subject if she did n’t . Merina was n’t feeling as magnanimous . “It
95036	95040	95041	95041	You	1901	” she said . “
95045	95061	95041	95041	You	1901	”He stared into the distance for a minute before leaning his elbows on his knees . “Four
95064	95072	95041	95041	You	1901	” she said when he said nothing . “Is
95083	95105	95075	95075	you	1901	” It was a question he did n’t want answered . She could tell by every tense line on his face . “
95129	95134	95125	95125	you	1901	”Okay . Fair enough . “You
95141	95223	95225	95225	you	1901	”If she thought he looked angry before , it was nothing compared to how he looked now . It made her heart sink to her stomach . If ever there was a time she did n’t want to be right , it was now and about Gwyneth . Merina had believed he ’d confided in her the night at his father ’s house when she ’d asked about his past , but he ’d been hiding from her the whole time . “Why
95242	95258	95225	95225	you	1901	” She was angry now , the questions coming at a rapid - fire pace . “
95291	95305	95278	95278	she	1903	” She pointed to the room where sliding patio doors overlooked the pool . “I
95319	95364	95367	95367	you	1901	” Reese stood from the chair , scraping the legs on the concrete as he did . She did n’t like when the cold crept in , when his shutters slammed down . When he refused to deal with messy feelings , namely hers . “Why
95383	95414	95417	95417	her	1909	” She stood also , fists curling at her sides . She ’d kept her cool in an effort to do as Penelope had suggested since this was supposed to be “
95420	95434	95417	95417	her	1909	” Well , fuck that . Gwyneth was n’t rolling off her back . “I’m
95451	95464	95467	95467	you	1901	” His tone was so controlled . Did he not regret lying to her?“Why
95481	95493	95471	95471	I	0	” Then she laughed , a humorless sound , and added , “
95502	95511	95477	95477	God	129	”His expression went from angry to borderline hurt . “Silly
95533	95548	95549	95549	Reese	101	Since—”“I’m broken , Merina ! Okay ? Is that what you want to hear ? ”
95581	95595	95576	95576	he	1901	“Yes . I do want to hear it . I want to know . ”“You
95600	95607	95576	95576	he	1901	” he repeated with a grunt . “
95638	95672	95628	95628	I	0	”She blinked , half stunned he admitted as much and half disappointed he could n’t see how wrong he was . Could n’t he see what they had was so much more than a “
95673	95678	95679	95679	she	1901	contract”?“That ’s not true — ”
95682	95686	95687	95687	he	1901	“It ’s true , ”
95690	95745	95746	95746	you	1901	“ After Gwyneth , I vowed never to stay at this house . She made me look like a grade A jackass . Humiliated me in front of my father , my coworkers , and anyone who suspected she ’d dropped me for Hayes . It ’s not an easy thing to recover from . ”“Reese—”“Have
95758	95777	95746	95746	you	1901	” He stalked over to her and captured her wrist . Her blood iced at his frigid tone . “The
95803	95816	95817	95817	you	1901	”But they ’d been more , at least to her they had . “Do
95826	95890	95822	95823	your father	2345	cookout?”She did n’t . Reese never told her . She did n’t like the idea of him telling her now when he was this upset . I’m broken . She did n’t want him to be broken . You ca n’t fix him . That sensible voice in her head kept her quiet . She would n’t take on Reese as a project . “I
95906	95910	95914	95914	he	2345	” he said . “
95941	95946	95947	95947	she	1901	”“That took some nerve , ”

96036	96041	96027	96027	Reese	101	“ Talk to me . ”“There

96081	96102	96072	96072	She	1901	“ I had an ex - boyfriend who … well , he lived with me in my parents ’ house . ”Reese
96132	96168	96171	96171	he	2380	“I told myself I loved him , and I guess in a way I did . He took advantage of me . He used me . Emptied my bank account and left with my money . ”Eyes

96186	96211	96171	96171	he	2380	” This was his way of empathizing , but could n’t he see he was more to her than a means to an end ? “
96256	96264	96251	96251	Gwyneth	153	” She gave his hand a squeeze . “
96270	96276	96265	96265	I	0	”“Why do people do that ? ”
96291	96306	96286	96286	He	2380	“ Pretend they understand what you ’re going through . Like when someone dies . ”Like

96349	96354	96355	96355	You	2380	” She almost laughed . “

96379	96423	96376	96377	an idiot	1078	“You know why no one ‘ understands ’ you , Crane ? Because you do n’t bother sharing . If you opened your mouth to do something other than get me off , we might have the occasional conversation and understand each other ! ”
96434	96449	96424	96424	She	0	“ Your pain does n’t outweigh mine because you ca n’t talk about it . ”“Fine
96472	96481	96468	96468	I	0	” Reese said , his voice raised again . “
96560	96571	96530	96530	I	0	instant”—he leaned in , his fingers pressed together to make his point—“I
96582	96605	96530	96530	I	0	”Merina ’s stomach flipped . She closed her eyes for a moment , trying to block out the pain in his words . “I
96635	96662	96633	96633	she	1929	” A muscle in his jaw flickered and Merina ’s heart sank . He ’d planned a life with Gwyneth . Here . In this house . “
96683	96728	96633	96633	she	1929	”Merina had fallen in love with him . Completely , no take - backs . What a shitty time to have that revelation . It hurt to hear he loved Gwyneth , but it hurt more to hear him slot love into the category of “
96731	96748	96633	96633	she	1929	” Reese equated love with being weak . Who needed love now that he had his precious company?“That
96756	96765	96633	96633	she	1929	” Reese continued , his voice eerily calm . “What
96791	96795	96633	96633	she	1929	”“No , Merina . ”
96803	96872	96633	96633	she	1929	“ Seeing my photo splashed on television was more than inconvenient and embarrassing . It was a reminder of a very important decision I made . The reason I dated random women and broke it off after one date for the last five years was because I never want to feel like that again . That ’s why our arrangement is and always was going to be temporary . ”It
96901	96904	96908	96908	Gwyneth	153	“ contract . ”“Women
96926	96940	96908	96908	Gwyneth	153	” He took a step away from her as if illustrating his point . “Reese—”“And
96945	96988	96990	96990	Reese	101	”Her face went cold . A part of her saw what he was doing and hated him for it . But a larger part loved him and hated to see how much he was hurting . That part of her spoke next . “Goddammit
96997	97037	97038	97038	You	101	” She wanted to touch him and if she thought he ’d allow it , she would have . As close as she thought they had become , she now saw she did n’t know his heart at all . “
97088	97157	97085	97085	I	0	”She had to stop talking when a lump seized her throat . And that lump came because her husband ’s face had n’t changed . His brows did n’t bow in sympathy and he did n’t come a single step closer to her . His navy eyes were dark and emotionless . Which meant she was wrong . He’d never considered them working out . He ’d never asked “
97161	97191	97083	97083	Reese	101	” She loved him and yet he could n’t see them as more than an arrangement . She was another in a long line . Soon to be forgotten . “I’m
97196	97203	97083	97083	Reese	101	” His face was studiously flat . “
97223	97584	97585	97585	them	1936	”He went inside and she watched him go . Everything had escalated so quickly . Or maybe it had n’t . Maybe this had been building since the night she laid eyes on Gwyneth at Alex ’s retirement party . That should have been her clue that Reese could n’t handle a relationship . She ’d patted herself on the back for handling his ex like a pro , and he had n’t handled it at all . Every part of her wanted to run after him now and finish this fight , but instead she rooted her feet to the ground and let him go . She’d risked too much tonight . If he did n’t know how she felt after that tirade , then he was a bigger idiot than she was . He may be protecting himself , but she needed to protect herself as well . She’d been taken advantage of once before and as a result had become stronger . She could deal with this . Even though her stupid heart had the worst taste in men , she would survive this . She ’d come out stronger . Eventually . * * * Nothing was working . Reese dropped his pen and leaned back in his chair , face to his hands . The massive headache behind his eyes had cropped up before lunch , and nothing he ’d done to stave it off had helped . Not the ten minutes he laid down on his couch and tried to rest his eyes , not the painkillers he swallowed , and not trying to ignore it by getting back to work . In the week that had passed since the fight with Merina , work had n’t been the same . The exhilaration of CEO he ’d felt initially had dulled . Now he just felt busy . He pulled a hand down his face . God . He felt like shit for the things he ’d said to her . The way he ’d walked away . She stood there on his back patio her vulnerability on display when she asked him to give “
97586	97598	97599	97599	we	1937	” a shot . Them as in him and Merina . The “
97600	97944	97585	97585	them	1936	” he ’d recognized when she ’d dropped off the frame was n’t in his imagination . But it was n’t the right thing to do . In a rare moment of word vomit , he ’d told her the truth . He was broken . Merina should be with someone who suited her , and while they were compatible as hell in bed , out of it … they weren’t . She was passion and vibrance and truth , and he was fear and cages and avoidance . At least when it came to relationships . She needed someone to bloom with — to thrive . He was n’t that guy . He’d slept in the guest bedroom every night since the argument and while he did n’t care what the house staff thought about having to make up two different beds in the morning , he did care that Merina had n’t chased him down . A big part of him expected her to demand he talk about things . When she did n’t , he figured she ’d given up , thereby giving him what he asked for . Saving herself and leaving him to himself . Only today , right now , that was n’t what he fucking wanted . She gave him space and he , for a change , wanted none . The night they ’d argued , the next night , and every night after , Merina ’s bedroom door remained closed . She remained behind it . This morning , outside her bedroom door he hesitated , hand poised to knock , but in the end walked away . The things he ’d told her were n’t nice , but they were true . If they were always meant to be temporary , he may as well let her begin disconnecting now . He ’d told her so much truth , he was sick from it . He and Merina had grown closer than he ’d anticipated . If he let himself think for a second “
97946	98126	98127	98127	You	1938	if” … well . He would n’t go there with her . He couldn’t . He blew out a breath now , his head still aching . No woman made him feel the way Merina Van Heusen did . Merina Crane , his mind corrected . Right . His wife . The outside world was n’t privy to their marital squabble , however . No , for the world they ’d become actors . Merina played the part and so did he . It was the way he ’d imagined things would be the day she ’d signed the premarital agreement , but after all they ’d been through , the distance felt wrong . The day after the argument , Penelope had called an emergency meeting at Crane Hotel . Merina showed up , looking fresh and beautiful , and Reese sat there with a mouthful of apologies he ’d had to swallow down . For the sake of business . For the sake of the future . Pen made it clear them being seen together was paramount . “
98162	98353	98152	98152	people	2714	”Merina accepted the challenge gracefully . Head up , with a curt nod , her viciously dominant spirit in charge . She ’d done a convincing job pretending to like him , which he assumed she did n’t . How could she after what he ’d said to her?He made it a point to drop her off and pick her up at work , placing a kiss on her lips for the waiting paparazzi . The Spread was milking Gwyneth ’s tweet . Pen had sent him a text with a link to an article featuring him and Merina at dinner yesterday . In the photo , Merina was leaning on the table , breasts on display , tattoo bare , smiling at him . He’d sat with his arm around her as she told him about her day and toyed with the knot of his tie . Her act was so genuine , he thought he was off the hook . He ’d taken her hand , hell - bent on dragging her to the single bathroom to devour her , but then she ’d mumbled under her breath , “
98359	98652	98152	98152	people	2714	”That ’s when he ’d realized it was all for show . The woman who had warmly touched him and showed off the tattoo she ’d previously hidden was simply enduring him until they could call it quits . It was frustrating and irritating … and exactly what she needed to do . He was all for pretending when he was part of the game , but the game had changed . She ’d closed off the part of her he ’d grown used to . Not just the sex part . The genuine Merina part . Now he was left with … he did n’t know . Some cardboard version of her . The wife he ’d spent the last week with was not the same woman who , drenched , had carried a doorknob into his office and called him a suited sewer rat . He smiled at the memory , but then his smile faded as pain lanced his chest . He missed her . And had no idea how to fix it . After their explosive argument , he assumed Merina felt something for him that was strictly unadvised . He ’d thought for a terrifying minute that she ’d fallen for him … or was about to . Fear hit him like a safe dropped from the top of a building . Being responsible for her heart … he could n’t . He ’d fail . Miserably and completely . Even thinking of her vulnerability in his hands now made his chest constrict . But things had n’t worked out that way after all . Merina soldiered on , respecting his boundaries . He would have thought he ’d be thrilled when she stopped hassling him about his “
98655	98847	98848	98849	Mr. Crane	103	”In general , he did n’t like to share . He did n’t want to talk about things . He was better living in the present . Step 1 , Step 2 , Step 3 … and on and on until the goal was reached . Along the way , Merina pulled information out of him . No . He ’d offered . He ’d wanted her to know about him . She was in his life , in his house … In my heart . She had a way of making him less mechanical and more open . Which was one of the reasons he asked her to do this with him in the first place . She was great with the press , with people in general . If anyone would believe the cold heart of the playboy had been won , Merina could convince them . So either he was a great actor , or she was really convincing , or … Or nothing . He sure as fuck was n’t going there . There was a light tap at the door , followed by Bobbie ’s voice . “
98851	98897	98848	98849	Mr. Crane	103	”His skull pulsed and he closed his eyes against in pain . He ’d asked his assistant not to use the intercom given that his brains kept trying to bust out of his cranium . She poked her head through a crack in the door . “
98933	98966	98970	98970	I’m	0	”An hour ? This day had vanished . He looked over the papers spread on his desk and the many pink notes from Bobbie with phone calls he ’d yet to return . “Uh
98981	98986	98987	98987	Bobbie	173	”“Very well , sir . ”
99017	99023	99024	99024	Penelope	145	“You have to be there , ”

99861	99866	99867	99867	she	84	“Still not feeling well ? ”

100336	100371	100325	100325	She	84	” Reese said as the car pulled into the driveway of their Lake Shore Drive mansion . So they were . She looked out the window at the home she ’d soon be leaving . “Driver
100373	100377	100325	100325	She	84	” Reese said . “

101327	101340	101307	101307	They	2344	” His hold loosened , but he did n’t let her go . “
101364	101374	101307	101307	They	2344	”Logical . Why did that word hurt more than the others?“So
101381	101407	101723	101723	his	2024	” Or had he sabotaged what they had , burned it right to the ground ? That theme kept making an appearance in her life . “Ironic
101417	101429	101723	101723	his	2024	” he said . He was too calm . Too controlled . “Gwyneth
101433	101488	101723	101723	his	2024	” Mimicking his cold tone , Merina shook her arm from his grip . He ran a hand through his hair , perfectly disheveled . There was a time not so long ago she ’d made a mess of his hair . Now the only mess was the one he ’d made of her . “She
101492	101511	101723	101723	his	2024	” he said . He snatched a pair of jeans lying across the bed and slid into them . “
101518	101599	101723	101723	his	2024	” He zipped up , then fastened his belt . Sabotaging . Most definitely . He wanted her to believe he and Gwyneth had slept together but Merina was n’t that stupid . He was pushing her away . Drawing those steel shutters down tight and cowering behind them . He was broken , all right . But she was n’t going to let him sit here in pieces while she had to go out into the world stitched together . “You
101604	101609	101723	101723	his	2024	” she pointed out . “No
101611	101625	101723	101723	his	2024	” He tucked his hands into his pockets and just … stood there . “Are
101634	101711	101626	101626	you	2024	” She gestured around the room , taking in the state of it for the first time . Messy . Reese was n’t messy . There was a room service tray pushed off to the side , the remains of a steak on a plate . One plate . More evidence he ’d spent the evening alone . There were dirty coffee mugs littering his desk and his wrinkled suit was a draped over a chair . “
101717	101719	101723	101723	his	2024	you?”“Don’t . ”She
101804	101809	101810	101810	she	2025	“You look like shit , ”
101859	101862	101851	101851	His	2024	“I’m fine . ”“No
101864	101871	101851	101851	His	2024	” She shook her head slowly . “
101876	101918	101872	101872	You	2024	” But she could see , even in his worn - out state , that he ’d made a decision and the decision was final . He was backing out of their marriage sooner rather than later . He was done . “
101933	101949	101872	101872	You	2024	”“It ’s better we do this now before your parents make any further holiday plans . ”Crack!He
101992	102000	101977	101977	He	2024	“Leave before I have you thrown out . ”
102029	102036	102037	102037	she	2024	“I love you , you idiot , ”
102063	102071	102072	102072	he	2024	“Gwyneth and Hayes are getting a divorce , ”
102093	102094	102089	102089	him	2024	“ What?”“She
102105	102129	102131	102131	you	2024	”Merina could n’t feel her face . Or her limbs . It was like her soul had snapped free and was floating overhead . “What
102135	102139	102143	102143	you	2024	” she whispered . “I
102145	102148	102143	102143	you	2024	’”“Good answer . ”Reese

102272	102279	102266	102266	he	2024	“Do you want me to go ? ”
102315	102317	102300	102300	she	2024	“No . ”
102323	102329	102331	102331	me	0	“ I just want you . ”“Then
102333	102629	102331	102331	me	0	” * * * Reese rerouted Merina ’s hands to the back of his neck . She put her fingers in his hair and gazed up at him with so much want and hope that his heart threatened to cave in . He’d tried . God help him , he ’d tried to get her to think something had happened between him and Gwyneth . Selfishly , he wanted Merina to leave angry and make things easier for him to end . But where she was concerned , he was weak . Her invitation that he could have her was far too tempting to pass up . One last time . Anticipation made his arms shake as he lowered his mouth to hers . Merina tasted like heaven . He ’d been missing her taste for far too long . When he saw her standing at the door of his suite , he could n’t remember ever being devastated and glad to see someone at the same time . Gwyneth had come to his suite earlier and he had just stumbled from the bathroom after about an hour of sleep last night . At first , he thought he was hallucinating . Then he wondered if she was . What she was asking was certifiable . He ’d never in a million years take her back . He could n’t believe she ’d come here to ask . Even if he had n’t been second place to Hayes all those years ago , it was too much to ask . Gwyneth tearfully shared that Hayes was cheating on her , which served her right . She wanted to know if Reese had seen her tweeted photo , and then she let him know she meant the “
102634	102637	102639	102639	I	0	” thing . “Yes
102642	103137	102639	102639	I	0	” was his response , followed by that colorful FU he ’d told Merina about . That interaction had left him pissed and Gwyneth in tears . Seeing Merina had hit him like a blast of cool air on overheated skin . He missed her . Two damn days apart had left him lonely and lost . Hadn’t he put her through enough loops on this marital roller coaster ? The divorce papers were drawn up . They sat on the desk behind Merina , but now that Merina was in his arms , he was n’t inclined to point them out . Now that he was kissing her , he could n’t stop . She loved him . Even after he ’d lied . And left . After she ’d seen Gwyneth leave his suite . Could he do nothing to deter her?A million excuses tumbled through his head but not a single one left his mouth . There was no way he ’d deny them this moment . No way he ’d let her leave without taking her in every way possible . Scent . Touch . Smell . He lifted her shirt over her head . Beneath his T - shirt , she explored his torso with her hands , showing no signs of hurry . He grabbed his shirt by the neck and pulled it off , adding it to a pile of clothes in the corner . Life had been hell without her . If forty - eight hours had reduced him to a pitiful slob who could n’t say no , what would the next forty - eight hours bring ? Or forty - eight days?He would n’t think about that either . He buried those fears the same way he buried his hands in her hair , slanting his mouth over hers and taking what he needed . But he would n’t rush . He refused to rush . Slowly , intentionally , his hands went to work on the clasp of her bra . Then lower , to the zipper at the side of her skirt . Panties were peeled down her legs , his lips following as he placed kisses on her thighs , the insides of her knees . High heels were slipped off and kisses delivered to her ankles . To the arch of one foot . Once Merina was nude , she started on him . Smoothing her hands over his chest , cupping his manhood over his jeans and giving him a gentle squeeze . She went to work on the fly , the zipper , pulled the denim down his legs . When her hand wrapped around his cock , Reese ’s mind blanked . No woman could replace her , and he hated that he had to let her go . But he did n’t dwell in that unpleasant future . Not when she kissed him deeply and commanded , “
103142	103245	102639	102639	I	0	”He stripped off his clothes , but when her hands came to his chest to shove him onto the bed , he stopped her . With a shake of his head , he lifted her into his arms and placed her on the blankets gently . So delicately . She never took her eyes off his . He started at her tattoo , kissing the flames , and then moving his mouth between her breasts . One irresistible kiss to each peach - pink nipple , he ran a hand down her ribs , over her hip , and lifted one leg . “So
103248	103259	103381	103381	she	101	” he mumbled against the silken skin of her stomach . “I
103264	103268	103381	103381	she	101	” she said . “You’ll
103273	103298	103299	103299	Reese	101	” He lifted his head to make sure she saw he was serious . Her head moved back and forth into a slight shake . “
103301	103364	103381	103381	she	101	”It was a plea . A plea for him to take her at a feverishly fast pace and give them the release she was begging for . If this was his last time with her , he refused to let her leave without knowing — on some level — what she ’d come to mean to him over these last few months . “You
103370	103377	103378	103378	he	2033	”“What happened to ‘ Reese ’ ? ”
103485	103489	103490	103490	she	101	“We’re not fucking , ”
103493	103495	103490	103490	she	101	“No . ”
103511	103520	103496	103496	He	2033	“ I ’m making love to my wife . ”He
103572	103579	103567	103567	she	101	“ I love you , Reese . ”He
103651	103661	103663	103663	you	2040	” Lorelei slid the divorce agreement across her desk . “
103688	103847	103663	103663	you	2040	”There was n’t . Merina had already moved her things out of the mansion . She did so tearfully , not caring that Magda and the come - and - go staff saw her wearing sweats , bawling as she packed up her things . Almost four weeks ago , in Reese ’s private suite , he ’d made love to her . She let him , unable to stop herself from telling him she loved him . Twice . Immediately after , he ’d led her into the shower . Silently , they stood in the steam , Reese soaping her body as she shivered , feeling everything too much . He did n’t confess that he loved her , which she assumed meant he did n’t . He ’d done it for her . He ’d given her one last hit of Reese Crane before he asked her to say good - bye to him permanently . “Take
103857	103875	103663	103663	you	2040	” he ’d said , scrubbing her back with a washcloth as she stood in the water . “
103891	103974	103980	103980	Mer	141	”She still did n’t know if he meant for her , him , or the press . She had n’t seen him since . There was no reason to . She did n’t live in the mansion any longer , and there was no reason to go to the hotel . Lore was right . The Van Heusen was squared away , so there was n’t anything left to do but sign on the bottom line . Lorelei handed her a pen . “It
103982	103986	103980	103980	Mer	141	” she said . “
103997	104021	103980	103980	Mer	141	”According to the Spread , Reese had . They posted a photo of him and Penelope having lunch and reported that the blonde had “
104029	104075	104076	104076	I	0	”Merina did n’t think it was true , but it made her feel a little better to imagine it was . Hating him was easier . After she ’d slapped him , she should ’ve turned and walked out . Then she would n’t have dangling “
104079	104084	104076	104076	I	0	” to contend with . “Mer
104086	104089	104090	104090	Merina	84	”“I know . ”
104136	104152	104153	104153	Merina	84	“He never called or texted . Not even to see if I ’d signed yet , ”
104157	104160	104153	104153	Merina	84	“I’m sorry . ”“So
104162	104175	104153	104153	Merina	84	I.”Everything they ’d had , gone with the stroke of a pen . “I’ll
104182	104240	104153	104153	Merina	84	” Lorelei called as Merina left . Merina did n’t respond . She walked out of Lore ’s office and headed straight back to the Van Heusen . * * * The rustling of plastic sounded in the room and Reese cracked his eyes open . Sunlight pierced his retinas , so he slammed them shut again . “No
104243	104873	104153	104153	Merina	84	” he grumbled , unsure why the maid was here . He ’d instructed her to come by once a week , and he remembered before he broke the seal on a bottle of sixty - year - old scotch last night that he ’d hung the DO NOT DISTURB sign . The numbers on the clock blurred , focused , then blurred again : 11:43 . He could n’t remember the last time he ’s slept past eight . Well , whatever . He was due a sick day , probably had a hundred of them in queue . Hungover counted as sick . And anyway he was in charge . He turned his face into the pillow , his skull aching like someone had split it with an axe . Today ’s hangover was n’t something he felt like dealing with . Neither was yesterday ’s . Or the one he ’d had the day before . They ’d become his new routine . He heard more rustling , but rather than deal with it , he pulled another pillow over his head . If she wanted to take the trash out so damn badly , fine . * * * The next time he opened his eyes , it was to the patter of rain on the windows . The room was dimmer , so that was a plus . His head still hurt when he opened his eyes , so it would make sense not much time had passed . Through a glass of water — where had that come from?—he made out the wavy numbers on the clock . The first number was a three . In the afternoon , he presumed . Since his tongue was glued to the roof of his mouth , he pushed up on one elbow and reached for the glass . Two aspirin sat next to the water , Bobbie ’s doing no doubt . He took them both , drank the water , then closed his eyes again to sleep hopefully another four or five hours . Then he could climb out of bed , order a pizza , and start drinking . But before he could sink into sleep , the sound of his cell phone pierced the air . A purring ringer he ’d turned off three days ago . He reached blindly for the phone and silenced it . Phone calls were the one thing he refused to let interrupt him . If the damn thing started ringing , it would never stop . He did n’t feel like dealing with anything . Not people . Not work . None of it . He had n’t shown up for a single meeting , had delegated most busy work , and Bobbie was handling his e - mails . If the board tried to shit - can him , Reese would deal with it then . Right now only one thing mattered . Getting through the worst heartbreak of his life and coming out the other side . There had to be another side . God help him , there had to be . * * * The smell of coffee permeated the air , and this time , his eyes sprang open . Okay , coffee was going too far . Even for Bobbie . Evening time was for drinking . With a groan , he pushed up to sitting and scrubbed his face with his hands . He was disoriented and thirsty , but at least his headache was gone . Eight p.m. He ’d made it through another day . Cell phone in hand , he squinted at the screen , fumbling through the menu to make sure the ringer was off . “Click
104880	104890	104153	104153	Merina	84	” a woman ’s voice cut into the air . “Thanks
104892	104941	104153	104153	Merina	84	” He flipped it with his thumb and the screen showed it was on mute . Wait . That voice was n’t Bobbie or the maid . He turned his head to find a slim redhead standing at the window , arms crossed over a pale pink suit . “You
104950	104977	104153	104153	Merina	84	” Gwyneth said , taking a few steps toward the bed . When she reached his side , she sat on the edge of the mattress . “
104986	104991	104978	104978	I	0	” Her nose wrinkled . “

105016	105022	105011	105011	him	2049	“What are you doing here ? ”

105181	105182	105176	105176	I	0	”“You think?”“Then
105187	105191	105183	105183	I	0	” she continued . “
105205	105211	105202	105202	her	84	” Her smile faded quickly . “
105220	105250	105251	105251	She	84	” Gwyneth shook her head softly , but not out of animosity , more like she was having a really late epiphany . Her eyes snapped over to him . “
105255	105260	105261	105261	He	2049	”“Loved . Past tense . ”

105401	105411	105381	105381	Reese	101	“You wo n’t sleep tonight anyway . Drink it . ”
105440	105451	105452	105452	he	2049	“Still waiting to find out why you ’re really here , ”
105455	105466	105452	105452	he	2049	“ You are n’t the most magnanimous person I know . ”A
105510	105524	105497	105497	she	84	“You mean am I here to try and convince you to take me back again?”“Are
105525	105527	105532	105532	she	84	you?”“No . ”
105593	105606	105590	105590	his	2049	“I’m sorry he hurt you . It sucks to be lied to . ”
105633	105635	105636	105636	She	84	“Thanks . ”
105645	105692	105636	105636	She	84	“ You know … I could see that Merina loved you when I saw her at your father ’s retirement party . What I did n’t know until I arrived here to your pigsty was that you loved her back . This is n’t like you . ”True
105729	105768	105815	105815	Gwyneth	153	“The night I met her , I figured the marriage was a stunt . You needed to clean up your reputation to land CEO and she ’s such a fantastic businesswoman . The perfect candidate for a wife . ”“It
105773	105781	105815	105815	Gwyneth	153	” No need to hide it now . “
105792	105814	105815	105815	Gwyneth	153	”“I should have known . You ’d never choose someone like her without a purpose . Then you fell for her , ”
105825	105847	105815	105815	Gwyneth	153	“ Since we split , your dates were temporary and easy to blow off . Merina is neither of those things . ”“She
105857	105873	105822	105822	her	84	” he said , remembering the moment of genius when he ’d hatched his plan . “Well
105875	105879	105822	105822	her	84	” Gwyneth stood . “
105885	105896	105882	105883	an idiot	1078	”“On that , you and Merina see eye to eye . ”“Take
105900	105908	105909	105909	I	0	” She stood and took his coffee . “
105913	105930	105932	105932	you	153	”“That ’s it ? You came here to dole out your unsolicited advice and now you ’re leaving?”“Make
105943	105953	105935	105935	Women	2643	” She gestured to his face and he scowled . “Merina
105956	106047	105935	105935	Women	2643	” He ran his fingers over his bristled jaw , remembering all the times she ’d done the same . She once commented how she liked the scrape of his chin over the inside of her thighs . He smiled to himself . Goddamn . He loved her so much even that smile hurt . Gwyneth rinsed his mug in the sink as he stood and half hobbled across the room . She was n’t kidding . He needed a shower . He paused , hand on the bathroom door . “
106050	106054	106056	106057	a dick	3188	”She looked up . “Hayes
106059	106085	106056	106057	a dick	3188	” he said . And because he would be downing scotch by the mouthful right now if Gwyneth had n’t barged in , he added , “
106089	106093	106087	106087	you	2059	”A small nod . “
106098	106165	106087	106087	you	2059	”He took a fast but thorough shower , emerging into his suite with a towel around his waist and scrubbing his hair with another . Gwyneth was gone , his coffee mug upside down , drying on a dishtowel . His lips quirked when he saw one of his dress shirts tossed over his desk . A Post - it note stuck to the collar read , “
106177	106588	106087	106087	you	2059	” He slipped the shirt on , his smile falling the moment he spotted what was on his bed . The divorce papers . She’d opened the envelope . An envelope containing more than their decree . On top of Merina ’s signature was a wedding ring . His wife ’s ring . Now your ex - wife . Panic seized his chest as reality sank in . Finally , and deep enough that his heart cracked right down the middle . He remembered the day he ’d given it to her . The moment he ’d seen her wearing the wedding dress in the shop . The instant he slid the soldered bands onto her hand during the ceremony . And when she kissed him , feeling the coolness of the ring on his cheek . The way the diamond glinted at the Van Heusen when she handed him the business card that read Merina Crane . Their shared past flashed in his memory . The nights in their bedroom . The mornings in the shower . That day in the kitchen . The evening she ’d come here and slapped him in the face . His knees threatened to give , and he grabbed the nightstand to keep from dropping . His hands shook . This was n’t panic . This was devastation . Similar to when he lost his mom , a veil of dread cloaked him . He remembered when she died , thinking he ’d never hug her again . He ’d never hear her voice again , and worst of all , he ’d never have the chance to tell her he loved her . Not ever again . With Merina , he was a chance to do all of those things . Hug her . Hear her voice . And no matter what she felt for him now , even if she did n’t want to hear it , he ’d tell her for the first time that he loved her . That he ’d been lying , to her and to himself , for too long . Even if she did n’t love him any longer , she deserved to know . And he would n’t let another minute pass without telling her . He snagged a pair of jeans off the floor as lightning streaked the sky . Rain poured down in sheets and he let out a dry laugh . Perfect .

107499	107523	107581	107581	you	2085	” he said . Her heart lunged for him and she mentally restrained it . She hated him . Or was trying to . “Celebrating

As it turned out , he was due to go away on business and his house sitter had another job lined up . He asked Rachel if she ’d take the gig , saying he could n’t stomach the idea of Adonis in a kennel . Then he told her his address and Rachel nearly drooled all over the bar in front of him . Crane Tower . Ooh la la . Not only would she get to live in his glorious fifteen - hundred - square - foot apartment , but he was paying her . Generously . She could add the money Oliver was paying her to her savings and find her own place . It was either that or move back home , and she was n’t willing to concede that battle yet .

The roommate situation that was n’t working had nothing to do with Bree or her significant other , Dean . Rachel adored Bree , and vice versa . They ’d become close in the two months since Rachel moved in with her , and really Rachel thought they ’d be roomies much longer than this . So did Bree . But then Bree ’s boyfriend , Dean , proposed and she said yes and he moved in and well … Rachel was now a third wheel . She did n’t want to be in the way of what her friends had , and she could tell what they had was really special . She could tell because she knew what a relationship looked like when it was n’t right . What Bree and Dean had was right . “I’m

She was an island , and leaving Ohio for Chicago was the scariest thing she ’d ever done in her life . But she ’d succeeded . Sort of . Breaking up with her boyfriend of two years , being homeless , and losing the job for which she attained her degree were minor setbacks . At least she hoped so . * * * “

Ever the underestimated brother , he should n’t be surprised at the board ’s reaction to his move . He ’d stepped up with an announcement that he was going to fix the bar issue , and the board had shrugged , stated it was not necessary , and then moved forth with their agenda . By the time they ’d adjourned , Tag had nearly snapped his pencil in half . He dropped the unused No . 2 to push a hand through his hair and then remembered it was pulled back . Long , nearly to his elbows , he preferred wearing it down , but for board meetings he wrangled it into a low - hanging pony - man - bun . He also wedged his wide shoulders into an uncomfortable button - down and wrapped his bulky thighs in trousers . He felt … wrong . Not himself . When confronted with the news a few months back that the board was n’t happy about the bars , he ’d prepared for his job to become a lot harder . He sent his effective but blasé behavior on vacation . Readied himself to step up and make Guest and Restaurant Services shine by taking home the bound report they ’d slapped onto the table that day . As a rule , he liked easy . He thrived on easy .

Tag did his job , was damn good at his job , but did n’t like too much structure . The bound report before him , the one he ’d received months ago , complete with spreadsheets , numbers , and projected targets , was seriously structured . And seriously pissing him off . “Why

112975	113021	113023	113023	your	0	” . The word fiscal was enough to give Tag hives , but he ’d pored over those sheets , those numbers , until his eyes bled . He ’d come in here ready to throw down , then they just … brushed him off . “It
113026	113033	113023	113023	your	0	” Reese said with a shrug . “
113040	113060	113023	113023	your	0	”“I’m going to make the profits sing . Acceptable loss does n’t factor into my plans for Crane Hotels . ”Reese
113076	113082	113083	113083	Tag	109	“I’ll do things my way , ”
113086	113087	113083	113083	Tag	109	“ This”—he
113100	113103	113083	113083	Tag	109	door—“is bullshit . ”Reese
113144	113150	113151	113151	Reese	101	“Look forward to hearing more . ”
113651	113653	113630	113630	He	109	“ no ”
113851	113855	113856	113857	the man	368	“Mr . Crane , ”
113860	113868	113848	113848	he	109	“Hey … uh . Man . Who was that?”A
113887	113901	113879	113879	Tag	109	“ I do n’t know , sir . Would you like me to find out?”“No
113903	113953	113879	113879	Tag	109	” Tag looked in the direction of where the car vanished . He liked not knowing . Liked the idea of running into the blonde again by chance . Maybe in the gym or the lobby . Or the elevator . Yeah , he ’d rather stumble across her . “No
113961	114009	113879	113879	Tag	109	” He nodded to the doorman and strode in , stepping onto the elevator a few minutes later . On the ride up , he realized he was leaning in the corner , smiling like a dope , the bar upgrade issue the furthest thing from his mind .
