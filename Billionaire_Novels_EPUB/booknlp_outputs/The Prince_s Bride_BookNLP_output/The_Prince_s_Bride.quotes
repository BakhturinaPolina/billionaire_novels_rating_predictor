7649	7686	7633	7634	his father	250	“ Something the Americans do so well . She reminded me of your mother when she was younger , before we married . Was she happy to see you , after all the time spent apart ? ”
7687	7691	7692	7692	Leopold	28	“ Not exactly . ”
7719	7732	7733	7733	Harry	43	“ In fact , she did n’t even remember me at all . ”
7745	7755	7741	7742	His father	250	“ Are you certain it was n’t a game ? ”
7756	7761	7762	7762	Leopold	28	“ It was n’t , ”
7766	7789	7762	7762	Leopold	28	“ Not only did she not remember me , but she also ran out on me last night after we … spoke . ”
7790	7797	7798	7798	Harry	43	“ How very American of her , ”
7830	7846	7847	7848	His father	250	“ Well , then , back to the photos ? We have another meeting at — ”
7878	7891	7870	7870	he	28	“ Wait . Why would she run away from a mere conversation ? ”
7899	7913	7870	7870	he	28	“ I do n’t know . How much sleep did you get — ? ”

7994	7997	7998	7999	His father	250	“ Hmmm . ”
8004	8032	7998	7999	His father	250	“ When it affects you , it is my business . And I know my son , and the face he makes when he ’s hiding something . ”

8092	8125	8084	8084	he	28	“ I ca n’t , not with her . She ’s not like us . She wo n’t understand . And it ’s such an outdated custom that really needs to be — ”
8126	8163	8164	8164	His	28	“ It does n’t matter who she is , or where she came from . You were with her , and you ca n’t risk that there might have been an heir created in the process . ”
8182	8235	8164	8165	His father	250	“ You ’re well aware of our laws and customs , and you know that if a future ruler might have been created , a child that could possibly run our country one day , you have to detain the woman in question — no questions asked . It ’s our way . ”
8268	8288	8263	8263	He	28	“ I ca n’t do it . Not to her . And I was careful . I always am . ”
8289	8296	8297	8298	his father	250	“ Did you sleep with her ? ”
8320	8323	8310	8311	His aide	235	“ Yes . ”
8324	8337	8338	8339	His father	250	“ Then she has to stay . She ’s a flight risk . ”
8342	8371	8338	8339	His father	250	“ I outrank you , son . If I say something needs to be done , then it ’ll get done , whether you like it or not . ”
8399	8447	8388	8389	His father	250	“ I ’m sorry , but it must be done . Think of it this way . You ’ll be under the same roof with her . Maybe it ’ll give you that second chance you always wanted . I remember you pining over her back then . ”
8556	8564	8565	8566	the king	274	“ Release a bulletin immediately , Harry , ”
8569	8577	8565	8566	the king	274	“ Under my command , not his . ”

8588	8621	8582	8582	Leo	28	“ If we ’re going to do this , then I ’ll take full responsibility for it . After all , it ’s my fault she ’s being forced to stay here . ”
8664	8688	8661	8661	Harry	43	“ We could just pretend it never happened . She ’s an American . Who cares if there ’s a baby , anyway ? ”

This order comes straight from the prince himself , and speculation has begun as to why His Highness wants the American brought to him unharmed — the royal office was very clear about that part . She is not to be injured , or seized by force . There is a financial reward for any tip that leads to the delivery of Ms. Forkes . The amount was unspecified . ”

9790	9802	9730	9730	she	27	“ Not happening . Someone — anyone — call it in . ”
9803	9811	9812	9812	she	27	“ But I did n’t do anything , ”
9842	9851	9830	9830	she	27	“ Please . You have to believe me ! ”
9852	9868	9869	9870	A woman	351	“ Does n’t matter . If the prince wants you , he ’ll get you . ”
9875	9883	9869	9870	A woman	351	“ We do n’t ask him questions . ”
9884	9887	9888	9888	Alicia	27	“ Obviously , ”

10377	10402	10373	10373	she	27	“ I hope it ’s a limo . Surely the prince ca n’t expect to illegally detain me without providing me with certain luxuries . ”
10403	10408	10409	10410	the woman	148	“ She ’s mad , ”
10416	10443	10409	10410	the woman	148	“ No . I ’m angry . And when I get in front of your precious little prince , he wo n’t know what hit him . ”
10444	10452	10454	10461	the man who had been on the phone	375	“ Do n’t you dare threaten him , ”

10495	10517	10518	10518	she	361	“ First of all , people , it was an expression . He should n’t abduct innocent women off the streets , ”
10536	10572	10518	10518	she	361	“ Clearly , he is doing so for a reason . He ’s a kind , fair , and benevolent man , who will make a fine ruler one day — long live the king . ”
10573	10579	10610	10610	his	380	“ Long live the king , ”

10745	10752	10753	10753	she	27	“ Do I get a choice ? ”
10768	10782	10757	10758	The man	147	“ Can you at least tell me what I ’m in trouble for ? ”
10783	10796	10797	10798	the man	147	“ I do n’t know whether you ’re in trouble or not , ”
10801	10812	10797	10798	the man	147	“ Maybe the prince simply wishes to speak with you . ”
10813	10827	10757	10758	The man	147	“ I bet you say that to all the women your prince imprisons . ”
10828	10840	10841	10841	She	27	“ I ’ve never detained a woman for the prince before . ”
10851	10874	10841	10841	She	27	“ Great . I ’m special . Wonderful . Maybe this is the only way he can get a girl ’s attention . ”
10911	10933	10905	10906	the man	147	“ The prince has never had trouble meeting women . Follow me . Let ’s get you safely to His Highness . ”

11135	11141	11127	11127	he	147	“ Speak freely , Jonathon . ”
11246	11255	11256	11257	Commander Jonathon	50	“ She did n’t fight back , physically , ”
11266	11288	11260	11260	He	28	“ But she ’s not happy , and I have a feeling she is n’t afraid to tell you as much . ”
11358	11381	11387	11388	The commander	412	“ I ’d expect nothing less . She has every right to be upset . I did detain her , after all . ”
11382	11386	11387	11388	The commander	412	“ About that … ”
11394	11414	11387	11388	The commander	412	“ May I be so bold as to ask what she did to deserve such treatment , Your Highness ? ”

11531	11536	11537	11538	The commander	412	“ One more thing . ”
11549	11611	11541	11541	his	412	“ This is her phone . Someone at the coffee shop took it from Ms. Forkes when she called to let her office know she was being detained . At least , that ’s what the people around her told the guards . Would you like us to contact her office and explain that she is in no danger from us ? ”
11683	11717	11680	11680	he	28	“ Yes , please do . I ’ll take that and return it to her . She ’s allowed any and all luxuries she requests from us . She ’s not our prisoner . ”
11718	11724	11680	11680	he	28	“ Then what is she ? ”
11725	11734	11735	11735	He	28	“ A guest . A very valued guest . ”
11750	11766	11735	11735	He	28	“ Ready the blue room in the West Hall . She ’ll be staying there . ”

11792	11802	11787	11787	He	28	“ Should a guard be set on the door ? ”
11803	11812	11813	11813	Leo	28	“ I do n’t think that ’s nec — ”
11833	11845	11846	11846	He	28	“ I ’ll let you know after I talk to her . ”
11850	11854	11846	11846	He	28	“ Very well . ”
12082	12087	12088	12088	she	27	“ Are you him ? ”
12130	12142	12143	12143	He	28	“ Are you the prince who ordered me to be detained ? ”
12205	12210	12194	12194	she	27	“ I … You … ”
12235	12246	12247	12247	She	27	“ Hello , Alicia . Long time , no see . ”

12879	12892	12893	12893	She	27	“ Well , yeah , why else would he hold me captive ? ”
12900	12909	12893	12893	She	27	“ I ’ve never even met the guy . ”
12910	12915	12939	12939	her	27	“ Well , actually — ”
12916	12927	12928	12928	She	27	“ You ’ve got to get me out of here . ”

13428	13474	13424	13424	she	27	“ Just so you know , I do n’t do stuff like that , and if I ’d known it was you , I definitely would n’t have done it . It was a one - time thing for me . A bucket list item . ”
13507	13515	13516	13516	he	439	“ Bucket list ? Are you ill ? ”
13535	13549	13516	13516	he	439	“ Are you seeing a doctor ? Is that why you ’re here ? ”

13698	13702	13683	13683	She	27	“ You did ? ”
13703	13706	13707	13707	She	27	“ Yeah . ”
13720	13725	13707	13707	She	27	“ Stupid , right ? ”
13726	13737	13683	13683	She	27	“ I do n’t think it ’s stupid at all . ”

13884	13887	13888	13888	She	27	“ Seriously ? ”
13893	13897	13888	13888	She	27	“ Why not ? ”
13914	13938	13900	13900	his	441	“ Because I ’m the one who brought you here . So , clearly , I ’m not about to let you go . ”
13939	13942	13943	13943	She	27	“ But … ”
13967	13978	13945	13945	her	27	“ Are you saying … you’re … are you … ? ”

14152	14161	14141	14141	She	27	“ You ’re the … the … prince . ”
14184	14203	14173	14173	She	27	“ So back in America , that story about you being the son of a wealthy fisherman … ? ”
14204	14213	14214	14214	He	443	“ Is true . Father loves to fish . ”
14217	14224	14214	14214	He	443	“ Just not for a living . ”
14225	14228	14229	14229	She	27	“ Wow . ”
14247	14252	14253	14253	He	443	“ Just … wow . ”
14331	14351	14352	14352	he	443	“ It ’s a lot to take in , but I ’m the same guy I was back then , ”
14361	14367	14352	14352	he	443	“ I ’m still Leo . ”
14425	14433	14434	14434	He	443	“ You ’ve made that very clear . ”
14437	14445	14434	14434	He	443	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
14446	14453	14454	14454	She	27	“ Nothing . Nothing at all . ”
14471	14497	14463	14463	her	27	“ So you brought me here under royal guard to … what ? Say hello ? To let me know we slept together last night ? ”
14583	14593	14558	14558	he	443	“ That ’s not why I brought you here . ”
14594	14598	14599	14599	She	27	“ Then why ? ”
14604	14612	14599	14599	She	27	“ What do you need from me ? ”
14613	14621	14622	14622	he	443	“ Why are you in this country ? ”
14645	14667	14668	14668	He	443	“ The company I work for is trying to secure a contract with your military to provide high quality Kevlar to — ”
14689	14692	14693	14693	he	443	“ Baker ? ”
14696	14701	14693	14693	he	443	“ Y - yes . ”

14773	14800	14770	14770	He	443	“ We can discuss that during your stay with us , if you wish . I ’m the one who makes the decisions about our military . ”
14806	14811	14801	14801	She	27	“ My … stay ? ”
14812	14831	14832	14832	he	443	“ You ’ll be staying here for a week or two , um , depending on the situation , ”
14845	14867	14832	14832	he	443	“ I ’ve had a room made ready for you . It ’s blue . I think you ’ll like it . ”
14944	14952	14923	14923	she	27	“ And if I decline to stay ? ”
14953	14961	14962	14962	She	27	“ I would rather you did n’t . ”
14972	14983	14962	14962	She	27	“ Might I ask why you ’re holding me captive ? ”
15011	15042	14993	14993	he	443	“ You ’re not a captive . You ’ll have free rein of the castle grounds for your entire stay . Servants who will answer your every call or desire . ”
15043	15047	15048	15048	She	27	“ I see . ”
15082	15101	15102	15102	He	443	“ Well , you can call it what you will . I ’ll call it what it is . ”
15114	15128	15102	15102	He	443	“ I spoke with my father , and even though you ’re not — ”
15155	15164	15144	15144	He	443	“ So he ’s still alive , then ? ”
15165	15176	15177	15177	He	443	“ Of course . He ’s only sixty - three . ”
15211	15217	15218	15218	She	27	“ How ’s your father ? ”
15298	15309	15290	15290	he	443	“ I ’m sorry , he was a good man . ”
15310	15316	15317	15317	She	27	“ Yeah . He was . ”
15326	15334	15322	15322	his	443	“ Why are you holding me hostage ? ”
15335	15348	15322	15322	his	443	“ For the last time , I ’m not holding you hostage . ”
15368	15376	15355	15355	Someone	227	“ Then I ’m free to go . ”
15387	15401	15377	15377	She	27	“ And there ’s no guard out there , waiting to stop me ? ”
15413	15416	15402	15402	He	443	“ Alicia … ”
15424	15429	15421	15421	her	27	“ Tell me why . ”
15430	15436	15437	15437	he	443	“ Because of last night , ”
15449	15454	15440	15440	She	27	“ What about it ? ”
15455	15460	15421	15421	her	27	“ We were intimate . ”
15461	15464	15465	15465	Her	27	“ Yeah . ”
15473	15483	15465	15465	Her	27	“ I know . I was there , too . ”
15493	15504	15465	15465	Her	27	“ You always had such a wonderful sense of humor . ”
15505	15510	15512	15512	his	443	“ Yeah . Fabulous . ”
15518	15524	15515	15515	he	443	“ There it is again . ”
15597	15611	15593	15593	she	27	“ What does last night have to do with you bringing me here ? ”
15612	15624	15625	15625	She	27	“ You ’re here because of what we did last night . ”
15637	15669	15625	15625	She	27	“ So , what , you hope it ’ll happen again , so you ’re locking me up to keep me close ? That ’s kind of pervy for a prince . ”
15670	15702	15703	15703	He	443	“ Well , I certainly would n’t mind it happening again . I ’d be a fool or a liar to say otherwise , and I ’m neither of those things . ”
15724	15740	15703	15703	He	443	“ I ’ve never forgotten you , and I ’ve always regretted not writing you — ”
15761	15764	15765	15765	she	27	“ Bullshit , ”
15790	15810	15765	15765	she	27	“ You wrote me , and you left me there waiting for you , you … you … shithead . ”
15824	15830	15821	15822	Typical man	469	“ What ? Waiting where ? ”
15831	15838	15839	15839	She	27	“ You — you — God . ”
15851	15868	15841	15841	her	27	“ You ’re unbelievable . You ’re actually going to act like you do n’t know ? ”
15887	15902	15878	15878	She	27	“ I ’m leaving . Right now . And you ca n’t stop me . ”
15941	15977	15931	15931	They	470	“ What are you so angry about ? Is it because I never wrote you after New York ? Because , not to point out the obvious , you did n’t write me , either . ”
15988	15991	15992	15992	She	27	“ Liar . ”
16039	16045	16046	16046	He	443	“ Let go of me . ”
16079	16086	16065	16065	he	443	“ I am not a liar . ”
16087	16102	16103	16103	she	27	“ Yet you say you never wrote me , and I never wrote you ? ”
16111	16124	16103	16103	she	27	“ I do n’t know what else to call it , then . ”
16125	16132	16133	16133	He	443	“ Nothing . Call it nothing . ”
16144	16155	16135	16135	his	443	“ Or , better yet , call it the truth . ”
16156	16167	16168	16168	He	443	“ I wrote to you , and you wrote back . ”
16173	16190	16170	16170	his	443	“ I do n’t know what ’s going on here , but that did n’t happen . ”
16249	16252	16242	16242	he	443	“ Whatever . ”
16253	16262	16263	16263	he	443	“ Why would I lie about writing letters ? ”
16271	16282	16263	16263	he	443	“ It does n’t matter . None of this does . ”
16294	16300	16283	16283	She	27	“ Just let me go . ”
16301	16306	16263	16263	he	443	“ I ca n’t — ”
16307	16314	16315	16315	She	27	“ Yeah . So you said . ”
16320	16324	16315	16315	She	27	“ Why not ? ”
16325	16331	16332	16332	he	443	“ Because we had sex , ”
16336	16372	16332	16332	he	443	“ As a prince , I have to be sure there was n’t a child made in the process , so you have to stay here with me , until we find out for certain . ”
16437	16444	16432	16432	he	443	“ Are you finished , then ? ”
16445	16454	16455	16455	she	27	“ You ca n’t be serious about this , ”
16462	16474	16455	16455	she	27	“ We used a condom . There is no secret baby . ”
16475	16481	16482	16482	He	443	“ Unfortunately , I am . ”
16499	16506	16482	16482	He	443	“ I do n’t joke often . ”
16507	16521	16533	16533	his	443	“ You ’re keeping me hostage until I get my period ? Seriously ? ”
16545	16548	16539	16539	his	443	“ Yes . ”
16549	16555	16482	16482	He	443	“ That’s … that ’s … ”
16562	16565	16566	16566	He	443	“ Illegal . ”
16589	16641	16566	16566	He	443	“ Actually , when it comes to the possibility of royal offspring , I have every right , by Randovian law , to detain you until we ’re sure . And since you ’re not Randovian , we thought it would be best to have you stay here , with me . ”
16642	16645	16646	16646	She	27	“ God . ”
16654	16660	16646	16646	She	27	“ What happened to you ? ”
16665	16671	16661	16661	His	443	“ What do you mean ? ”
16672	16681	16682	16682	she	27	“ What made you so … so cold ? ”
16686	16703	16682	16682	she	27	“ I ’m not cold . I ’m fairly certain I showed you that last night . ”
16764	16811	16754	16754	he	443	“ When I touched you , made you come , I was n’t cold . When you screamed , your body tensing around mine as I was buried inside you , that was n’t cold . It was fucking hot , and we both know it . ”
16853	16871	16872	16872	She	27	“ And now you ’re abducting me to make sure I ’m not pregnant with your baby . ”
16887	16896	16872	16872	She	27	“ Do you realize how crazy this is ? ”
16897	16903	16904	16904	His	443	“ Not just any baby . ”
16908	16915	16904	16904	His	443	“ The future ruler of Randovia . ”
16945	16961	16979	16979	his	443	“ Like I said , we used protection . There wo n’t be a baby . ”
16962	16976	16977	16977	He	443	“ And you ’ll be free to go , once that ’s certain . ”
17010	17017	16990	16990	he	443	“ Until then , you stay . ”
17018	17036	17037	17037	She	27	“ Or , instead , I could text you or call you when I get my period . ”
17042	17057	17037	17037	She	27	“ I ’ll let you know when a baby is out of the equation . ”
17058	17101	17102	17102	He	443	“ I ’m sure you would , but there have been times where women have lied , so it ’s become custom to play it safe . That way there are no little princes or princesses running around unaware of their heritage . ”
17110	17126	17102	17102	He	443	“ We simply ca n’t risk it . It ’s a law in my country . ”
17127	17144	17145	17145	He	443	“ So , what , every time you sleep with a woman , you kidnap her ? ”
17168	17249	17145	17145	He	443	“ Most women consider it an honor to receive an invitation to stay at the palace . But for the record , I do n’t make it a habit to sleep around , for this very reason . If I have sex , it ’s with a woman who fully understands the situation , and what comes after . Last night was … special , in more ways than one . When I saw you , I broke my rules . ”
17250	17256	17257	17257	she	27	“ Yay . Lucky me , ”
17264	17272	17260	17260	He	443	“ I understand your frustration , but — ”
17273	17281	17282	17282	She	27	“ I do n’t think you do . ”
17323	17332	17317	17317	he	443	“ You live in your pretty little castle . ”
17336	17343	17317	17317	he	443	“ Wearing your pretty little suits . ”
17346	17372	17373	17373	He	443	“ And wave your pretty little hand to order me abducted out of a coffee shop before I could so much as finish my croissant . ”
17382	17395	17373	17373	He	443	“ Would you like another croissant brought to you , my lady ? ”
17396	17401	17402	17402	She	27	“ What ? No . ”
17408	17415	17402	17402	She	27	“ That ’s not the point . ”
17416	17420	17421	17421	He	443	“ I know . ”
17450	17459	17460	17460	She	27	“ That was my attempt at a joke . ”
17464	17479	17460	17460	She	27	“ Well , I see why you do n’t do it often , then . ”
17486	17489	17480	17480	He	443	“ Touché . ”
17498	17512	17490	17490	She	27	“ Is it so bad to spend a few nights in my castle ? ”
17527	17553	17513	17513	He	443	“ I , for one , would like to get to know you again . I ’ve always regretted not staying in touch with you . ”
17623	17634	17635	17635	she	27	“ I know all I need to know about you , ”
17642	17665	17635	17635	she	27	“ And I have no regrets over how you acted after you left New York . It showed me your true character . ”
17709	17717	17718	17719	The man	147	“ Please show me to my room . ”
17748	17751	17738	17738	Leo	28	“ Alicia — ”
17752	17758	17759	17759	She	27	“ Let go of me . ”
17765	17776	17759	17759	She	27	“ And go to hell while you ’re at it . ”
17804	17812	17801	17801	he	28	“ As you wish , my lady . ”
18310	18323	18326	18326	she	502	“ Please tell him I ’m not interested in his stupid dinn — ”
18337	18341	18332	18332	she	502	“ Go away . ”
18342	18345	18346	18346	He	28	“ I — ”
18436	18441	18442	18443	The guard	394	“ Jesus , Alicia . ”
18469	18495	18464	18464	She	27	“ Wow . It must be nice to have the power to stop a man in his tracks with nothing more than a magical stare . ”
18496	18534	18535	18535	He	28	“ It would be nicer if my ‘ magical stare ’ worked on you , too . Or , better yet , my kisses . As I recall , they worked pretty damn well at the club . ”
18610	18617	18628	18628	she	27	“ Maybe we could try again ? ”
18618	18627	18628	18628	she	27	“ I ’d rather kiss my own foot , ”
18711	18720	18738	18738	She	27	“ You ca n’t stay in there forever . ”
18721	18737	18738	18738	She	27	“ No , but I can stay in here until I ’m permitted to leave . ”
18746	18762	18738	18738	She	27	“ And , for the record , we have no reason to spend time together . ”
18768	18788	18763	18763	He	28	“ I disagree . You may be in denial , but I see how your body reacts to me . ”
18789	18808	18829	18829	his	28	“ You ’re welcome to fool yourself into thinking that , if that ’s what you ’d like . ”
18809	18825	18826	18826	he	28	“ Let me in , and I ’ll show you just how wrong you are , ”
18833	18837	18826	18826	he	28	“ Several times . ”
18849	18855	18838	18838	She	27	“ No , thank you . ”
19099	19102	19103	19103	she	27	“ Stop , ”
19118	19122	19123	19123	he	28	“ Stop what ? ”
19127	19139	19140	19140	she	27	“ Stop looking at me like you ’ve seen me naked , ”
19228	19249	19250	19250	she	27	“ I do n’t care how much I still want to jump your bones , I ’m not going to — ”
19260	19273	19250	19250	she	27	“ Oh my God . Did I just say that out loud ? ”
19319	19350	19351	19351	She	27	“ I did n’t mean to say that . I ’m just hungry , for food , so I want to jump your bones … for food … not sex . ”
19359	19372	19356	19356	her	27	“ Yeah . No . That did n’t make it any better . ”
19382	19385	19373	19373	He	28	“ Nope . ”
19386	19391	19392	19392	She	27	“ Just go away . ”
19407	19418	19419	19419	he	28	“ You know what the sad part about that is ? ”
19435	19438	19430	19430	She	27	“ What ? ”
19439	19481	19487	19487	he	28	“ I have n’t seen you naked in a long time — but damn , you have no idea how badly I wish I had . I have n’t able to get you out of my head the last three days . ”
19510	19583	19487	19487	he	28	“ If you ’d let me , I ’d touch you , caress you , kiss you , taste you . Everywhere . But this time , I ’d go slowly . Cherish every inch of you intimately , as I should have the first time we were together , until you ’re crying and begging me to make it stop . And I will . Make it stop . I promise . ”
19597	19608	19584	19584	She	27	“ Stop saying those things . Someone will hear you . ”
19609	19633	19634	19634	His	511	“ Then let me in , so I can say them in the privacy of your room . Because I wo n’t stop . ”
19647	19698	19645	19645	her	27	“ I will never force myself on you , or coerce you in any way , but you can be damned sure I ’ll use every fucking chance I have to let you know how badly I want you . Once was n’t enough . It will never be enough . ”
19762	19807	19752	19752	she	27	“ You ’re ridiculous . And just so you know , that … what you just mentioned … was a one - time deal . Never happening again . But you ca n’t stand out in the hall talking dirty . It ’s weird . ”
19808	19814	19815	19815	He	511	“ If you say so . ”
19820	19852	19815	19815	He	511	“ We had so much fun when we were kids . I ’d like a second chance to show you that we can , at the very least , be friends . ”
19897	19906	19907	19907	she	27	“ Yeah , I do n’t think so , ”
19915	19944	19907	19907	she	27	“ I do n’t particularly like the man you ’ve become , and I choose instead to remember the boy I knew … before you left New York . ”
20004	20034	19989	19989	He	511	“ You liked me in that hallway , before you found out who I was . You liked it when I fucked you against that wall , hard and — ”
20035	20043	20044	20044	He	511	“ Oh my God , shut up . ”
20048	20064	20065	20065	he	511	“ Okay . But can you at least try to put yourself in my shoes ? ”
20069	20117	20065	20065	he	511	“ I told you , I do n’t sleep around , and it ’s for this very reason . I do n’t enjoy detaining a woman to make sure that the condom I ’ve been carrying inside my wallet for three years did its job . And — ”
20134	20138	20118	20118	She	511	“ Three years ? ”
20139	20142	20143	20143	He	511	“ Yes . ”
20163	20225	20226	20226	She	511	“ That was the last time I … well , you know . I date a great deal . It ’s sort of expected . But like I ’ve said , I do n’t sleep with everyone I date . This antiquated law of ours is a pain in the ass and puts a damper on a guy ’s sex life . ”
20229	20255	20256	20256	she	511	“ You — a young , attractive prince who could get anyone in this country in his bed — haven’t had sex for three years ? ”
20269	20272	20273	20273	he	511	“ Shh , ”
20289	20305	20273	20273	he	511	“ Please . Let me in so we can talk privately . I beg you . ”
20311	20314	20273	20273	he	511	“ Beg ? ”
20315	20322	20332	20332	she	511	“ That ’s right . Beg . ”
20323	20326	20329	20329	her	511	“ Wow . ”
20349	20355	20332	20332	she	511	“ That must ’ve hurt . ”
20364	20368	20359	20359	he	511	“ A little . ”
20369	20378	20379	20379	He	511	“ I was n’t talking about the foot . ”
20382	20388	20379	20379	He	511	“ My response still stands . ”
20389	20392	20393	20393	she	511	“ Interesting , ”
20399	20403	20393	20393	she	511	“ And honest . ”
20404	20425	20359	20359	he	511	“ I ’m a straightforward man . If you ask me a question , you ’ll get an honest answer . ”
20435	20442	20429	20429	she	511	“ Why are you so honest ? ”
20443	20469	20470	20470	She	511	“ A ruler ca n’t afford to get caught in a lie . I ’ll never lie to you , Alicia . I swear it . ”
20512	20519	20502	20502	she	511	“ What ’s your biggest fear ? ”
20538	20541	20531	20531	she	511	“ Failure . ”
20542	20553	20554	20554	she	511	“ What ’s the best thing about being a prince ? ”
20561	20565	20554	20554	she	511	“ The castle . ”
20591	20619	20588	20588	he	511	“ And the cars . I have a lot of fast cars . I could take you for a ride in one , if you ’d like . ”
20623	20629	20620	20620	She	511	“ Such a guy answer . ”
20686	20744	20674	20674	She	511	“ Okay , fine . Real answer . I like being able to change the country for the better . I enjoy making laws , and making sure people live by them . I hope to be remembered for my fairness , and for making our struggling country financially stable . I hope to make a difference . ”
20754	20763	20745	20745	She	511	“ How are you going to do that ? ”
20764	20770	20771	20771	He	511	“ According to my father ? ”
20776	20804	20771	20771	He	511	“ Through marriage to a wealthy princess , of course . He ’s got one in particular in mind for me , and she ’s willing but … ”
20805	20811	20812	20812	she	511	“ Of course she is , ”
20836	20842	20843	20843	He	511	“ And according to you ? ”
20852	20909	20843	20843	He	511	“ No fucking way that will happen . The only thing she talks about is shoes . I get it , people like shoes , but it ’s an obsession . So , that ’s a no , according to me . I ’m determined , when the time is right , to marry for love . ”
20910	20913	20914	20914	she	511	“ Love ? ”
20917	20927	20914	20914	she	511	“ I did n’t know princes married for that . ”
20928	20934	20935	20935	he	511	“ They generally do n’t , ”
20938	20982	20935	20935	he	511	“ But it does n’t stop me from hoping I could . I ’ve given up many things in my life , without reservation . I live to serve the country , my people , but I wo n’t give up on that . ”
20983	20993	20994	20994	she	511	“ And if you ca n’t marry for love ? ”
21034	21043	21020	21020	He	511	“ Then I wo n’t marry at all . ”
21052	21064	21049	21049	he	511	“ I need a scotch . Would you like a brandy ? ”
21065	21068	21069	21069	She	511	“ No . ”
21072	21079	21069	21069	She	511	“ I ’ll take a scotch . ”
21080	21085	21086	21086	He	511	“ Are you sure ? ”
21092	21098	21086	21086	He	511	“ It ’s pretty stiff . ”
21099	21107	21069	21069	She	511	“ Yeah . I like it stiff . ”
21121	21136	21115	21115	she	511	“ Do n’t even think about making that a dirty comment of some sort . ”
21145	21150	21137	21137	He	511	“ As you wish . ”
21151	21156	21157	21157	He	511	“ I see that . ”
21179	21183	21163	21163	he	511	“ See what ? ”
21184	21188	21189	21189	She	511	“ That smile . ”
21196	21206	21191	21191	her	511	“ But my face was turned away from you . ”
21212	21221	21209	21209	her	511	“ Does n’t matter . Still saw it . ”
21222	21225	21226	21226	He	511	“ Impressive . ”
21264	21277	21247	21247	her	511	“ So you ’ve developed X - ray vision while at Baker ? ”
21289	21324	21278	21278	Her	511	“ Not yet , but we ’re working on it . And we have infrared binoculars that are ages above anything anyone else will have . You have to see them to believe them . ”
21325	21331	21332	21332	He	511	“ I ’d like to . ”
21339	21347	21332	21332	He	511	“ How long have you been there ? ”
21348	21385	21386	21386	He	511	“ A year , and I ’ve already seen them make long strides in the protection of our military . We want to do the same thing for you and your country . Take you further . ”
21389	21409	21386	21386	He	511	“ I ’ve looked over the proposal , and I ’m definitely interested in what you have to say . ”
21410	21420	21421	21421	she	527	“ I can answer any questions you might have , ”
21425	21432	21421	21421	she	527	“ I ’m an open book . ”
21433	21440	21441	21441	he	511	“ What ’s your biggest fear ? ”
21454	21460	21445	21445	She	527	“ I meant about Baker . ”
21461	21467	21468	21468	he	511	“ My question still stands , ”
21472	21479	21468	21468	he	511	“ Being left alone in airports . ”
21480	21483	21445	21445	She	527	“ Ah . ”
21515	21541	21542	21542	She	527	“ Let me guess . I ’m the one who supposedly left you alone in one , after writing you a letter I never wrote ? ”
21558	21565	21555	21555	her	527	“ Yes . At La Guardia . ”
21566	21578	21579	21579	he	511	“ And why , exactly , were you at the airport ? ”
21583	21588	21579	21579	he	511	“ You know why . ”
21589	21594	21595	21595	He	511	“ I do n’t . ”
21603	21614	21595	21595	He	511	“ But I assume you ’re about to tell me ? ”
21615	21622	21623	21623	she	527	“ No . I ’m not , ”
21633	21654	21623	21623	she	527	“ No matter what happened that day , it does n’t change the fact that I do n’t like you . ”
21703	21716	21717	21717	He	511	“ Oh , you like me in the one way that matters . ”
21731	21742	21717	21717	He	511	“ I think that night in the hallway proved that . ”
21743	21748	21749	21749	She	527	“ That proved nothing . ”
21756	21782	21749	21749	She	527	“ Other than the fact that I was desperate to cross an item off my bucket list . Desperate enough to choose you , even . ”
21795	21838	21839	21839	She	527	“ And if not for that item , you never would have noticed me standing across from you in that room . Never would have come over to me and shared a drink , or a laugh , or even a kiss ? ”
21846	21918	21839	21839	She	527	“ You ’ve offered me honesty , so I ’ll do the same . Yes , I would have seen you , and yes , I probably would have thought you were handsome . But I never would have come over to you , let alone kissed you , or found the nerve to go in that hallway with you , without this list burning a metaphorical hole in my pocket . ”
21919	21923	21924	21924	he	528	“ Why not ? ”
21974	21988	21989	21989	she	527	“ Because it had been a lot longer than three years for me , ”
22005	22013	21989	21989	she	527	“ Ten years , to be exact . ”
22117	22133	22134	22134	she	527	“ Guess you were n’t as worried about a love baby back then , huh ? ”
22143	22164	22138	22138	He	528	“ Uh … no . I was n’t . If my father knew what we did back then , though … ”
22171	22176	22177	22177	She	527	“ Well , yeah . ”
22182	22200	22177	22177	She	527	“ No one ’s touched me since you . Does that make you feel good about yourself ? ”
22209	22226	22201	22201	He	528	“ Are you trying to trap me into saying something that will get me in trouble ? ”
22241	22247	22201	22201	He	528	“ Not at the moment . ”
22248	22252	22253	22253	She	527	“ But later ? ”
22263	22282	22253	22253	She	527	“ I ’m just giving you the same honesty you gave me . Trying to keep it real . ”
22283	22293	22294	22294	He	528	“ I wish you ’d told me that earlier . ”
22299	22311	22296	22296	his	528	“ I would have been more of a gentleman that night . ”
22312	22317	22318	22318	she	527	“ Against a door , ”
22322	22325	22318	22318	she	527	“ Riiight . ”
22333	22352	22326	22326	He	528	“ And you chose your first time in ten years to be in a bar … why … ? ”
22353	22357	22358	22358	she	527	“ Bucket list , ”
22362	22380	22358	22358	she	527	“ I was supposed to have a one - night stand and then ditch the guy after . ”
22387	22395	22383	22383	he	528	“ Who gave you this bucket list ? ”
22396	22399	22400	22400	She	527	“ Brian . ”
22408	22417	22400	22400	She	527	“ An old friend . A best friend . ”
22422	22427	22418	22418	His	528	“ Is he … ? ”
22428	22433	22434	22434	She	527	“ Yes . Cancer . ”
22456	22464	22446	22446	Brian	34	“ A little under a year ago . ”
22603	22608	22588	22588	he	34	“ I ’m sorry . ”
22669	22679	22666	22666	his	34	“ What else is on this list of yours ? ”
22680	22701	22666	22666	his	34	“ Lots of things , all meant to make me live and be adventurous , since I suck at that . ”
22735	22760	22761	22761	He	34	“ Fall in love . Break a heart . Have my heart broken . Get sloppy drunk in public . Visit a foreign city . ”
22765	22773	22761	22761	He	34	“ Some of which you ’ve done . ”
22774	22784	22785	22785	He	34	“ Two . Actually , one , I guess . ”
22788	22792	22785	22785	He	34	“ How so ? ”
22793	22807	22808	22808	She	527	“ I might have to cross off the one - night stand one . ”
22811	22814	22815	22815	She	527	“ Because … ”
22820	22826	22815	22815	She	527	“ Well , you know . ”
22845	22850	22841	22841	His	34	“ Wait . What ? ”
22851	22888	22889	22889	His	34	“ I did n’t ditch you . You ’re here . And technically , you were n’t a stranger , and we ’d already been together . I just did n’t know it at the time . ”
22909	22919	22906	22906	she	527	“ I guess I ’ll have to find another — ”
22920	22925	22926	22926	he	34	“ It fucking counts , ”
22929	22936	22926	22926	he	34	“ You ditched me quite effectively . ”
22948	22954	22942	22942	She	527	“ If you say so . ”
22955	22959	22960	22960	He	34	“ I do . ”
22967	22978	22960	22960	He	34	“ Mind if I call dinner up , my lady ? ”
22979	22995	22996	22996	He	34	“ If you wish , Sir Royal - pain - in - my - ass . ”
23008	23032	22996	22996	He	34	“ Maybe I should make that my new royal title . It has a certain ring to it , do n’t you think ? ”
23033	23040	23045	23045	he	34	“ I find it very fitting . ”
23243	23245	23246	23246	he	28	“ wonderful ”
23413	23420	23411	23411	herself	537	“ You like what you see ? ”
23421	23424	23425	23425	She	537	“ Nope . ”
23432	23452	23425	23425	She	537	“ Why were you at the nightclub that night ? Seems like an un - princely thing to do . ”
23501	23555	23498	23498	he	28	“ I like to see how the country thinks I ’m doing . You ’d be surprised how often my name comes up in clubs , and that one is particularly handy because I can darken my hair , put in brown contacts , and hide my face without looking out of place . ”
23556	23569	23570	23570	she	537	“ You do all of that to hear how you ’re doing ? ”
23573	23579	23582	23582	he	28	“ Wow . Okay then . ”
23588	23597	23582	23582	he	28	“ You ’re laughing at me . Why ? ”
23598	23613	23614	23614	She	537	“ I just did n’t expect you to care what others think about you . ”
23621	23656	23614	23614	She	537	“ I mean , look at you . You ’re a prince , you walk around in suits , everyone bows to you , but you ’re secretly worried they do n’t like you . ”
23657	23677	23678	23678	He	28	“ Believe it or not , I do want to be liked , and to be a fair ruler . ”
23687	23698	23678	23678	He	28	“ It ’s human nature to want to be liked . ”
23699	23705	23706	23706	She	537	“ If you say so . ”
23717	23733	23706	23706	She	537	“ I do n’t really care whether people like me or not . Not anymore . ”
23734	23739	23678	23678	He	28	“ What changed that ? ”
23740	23746	23747	23747	she	537	“ I do n’t know , ”
23751	23757	23747	23747	she	537	“ Life , I guess . ”
23846	23861	23862	23862	he	28	“ It ’s good not to care , in some ways , I suppose , ”
23865	23875	23862	23862	he	28	“ I do n’t have that luxury , though . ”
23876	23899	23900	23900	she	537	“ Why not ? You ’re a prince , not a president . It ’s not like they ’ll vote you out , ”
23904	23928	23900	23900	she	537	“ I refuse to be that type of ruler . The kind who does n’t care about his people ’s wishes and thoughts . ”
23941	23957	23929	23929	He	28	“ My father is n’t like that , and I wo n’t be , either . ”
23965	23969	23929	23929	He	28	“ I see . ”
23980	23987	23977	23977	she	537	“ You can take it off . ”
23994	24005	23988	23988	She	537	“ And that . I wo n’t let anyone know . ”
24006	24012	24013	24013	He	28	“ I know I can . ”
24021	24070	24013	24013	He	28	“ But it ’s my duty to look the role , as well as fill it , because you never know when someone will come by the palace and catch you off - guard . One time , my father was in pajamas , and the queen of — ”
24133	24139	24140	24140	he	28	“ Give me a minute , ”
24194	24207	24179	24179	he	28	“ Bring it in front of the fire , please , Samuel . ”
24356	24359	24353	24353	she	537	“ Coincidence ? ”
24360	24363	24364	24364	He	28	“ No . ”
24403	24449	24464	24464	his	28	“ Truth be told , I had cook prepare it every night in case you came to supper . That ’s part of the reason I insisted you join me tonight . If I had to eat one more plate of room temperature roast beef … ”
24498	24501	24485	24485	he	28	“ What ? ”
24502	24505	24506	24506	He	28	“ Nothing . ”
24510	24557	24506	24506	He	28	“ It ’s just … your laugh . It ’s haunted me all these years , and hearing it now … it ’s as beautiful as I remembered . Maybe more so . Just like you are . You ’re stunning , Alicia . Absolutely stunning . ”
24558	24565	24566	24566	She	537	“ Oh . Uh … thanks . ”
24610	24643	24644	24644	He	28	“ I do n’t know if yours is the same or not . You have n’t really laughed yet . Not a real one . When ’s the last time you did ? ”
24647	24663	24644	24644	He	28	“ I do n’t know . It ’s not exactly something I keep track of . ”
24664	24671	24644	24644	He	28	“ Of course you do n’t . ”
24809	24820	24795	24795	he	28	“ When ’s the last time you let someone down ? ”
24821	24826	24827	24827	he	28	“ Three days ago , ”
24831	24841	24827	24827	he	28	“ When I brought you here against your will . ”
24852	24864	24865	24865	He	28	“ You could fix it . You could set me free . ”
24882	24932	24865	24865	He	28	“ No . What ’s done is done . I ca n’t let you go till we see this thing through . It ’s in the books now . Recorded in history . Unfortunately , and I hope you believe me , there ’s no way out of this . ”
24942	24979	24933	24933	She	565	“ Wait a second . You ’re telling me I ’ll be forever remembered in your history for the fact that I had sex with you in a bar and was held in the castle afterward ? ”
24986	24989	24982	24982	his	28	“ Uh … ”
24990	24998	24999	24999	she	565	“ I could kill you right now , ”
25002	25005	25006	25006	he	28	“ Understandable , ”
25026	25043	25044	25044	She	565	“ But instead , how about we eat , and you tell me more about Baker . ”
25051	25076	25044	25044	She	565	“ Do n’t try to distract me from this mess with offers of a contract once this is over . It wo n’t work . ”
25077	25088	25089	25089	he	28	“ I did n’t offer a contract of any sort , ”
25093	25145	25044	25044	She	565	“ I told you , I wo n’t lie to you . Do n’t think my agreement to discuss your company , or my guilt over detaining you , will make me agree to a business deal . I do n’t let business and pleasure interfere with one another like that . ”
25146	25173	25178	25178	he	28	“ So you mean , you do n’t have sex in nightclubs with all the women who come to your country to present cases to you ? ”
25187	25202	25178	25178	he	28	“ You know I do n’t . That was just because it was you . ”
25219	25225	25209	25209	his	28	“ Please do n’t think — ”
25226	25261	25262	25262	She	566	“ And you have every right to be angry , but I ca n’t be upset or regretful over something that brought you back into my life . Clearly , someone intercepted your letters — ”
25265	25325	25262	25262	She	566	“ And despite your inability to believe that , I ’ve thought about you a lot over the years , and you ’ve always been special to me . I would like to take this time to get to know you , to see if maybe we can be friends again . Perhaps we could let the past go ? ”
25545	25548	25549	25549	She	566	“ No . ”
25594	25618	25619	25619	Liar	60	“ I do n’t want to be your friend , Leo . I just want to go home and forget this ever happened . ”
25694	25730	25688	25688	He	28	“ Well , then , by all means , I ’ll leave . I ’ve already forced my home upon you , so I wo n’t force myself any longer . Good night , Alicia . ”
25760	25763	25768	25768	he	28	“ Night . ”
25790	25793	25781	25781	he	28	“ Alicia ? ”
25870	25873	25849	25849	he	28	“ Yeah ? ”
25874	25930	25931	25931	She	566	“ I am sorry that someone ruined what we had . What we shared together was — is — very special to me . So are you . And you can rest assured I will get to the bottom of this and find out who hurt you with those letters , one way or another . ”
26089	26092	26093	26093	he	28	“ Enter , ”
26111	26118	26107	26107	his	250	“ Are you busy , son ? ”
26119	26126	26129	26129	he	28	“ No , of course not . ”
26149	26166	26129	26129	he	28	“ I ’m never too busy for you , Father . Come in , come in . ”
26185	26193	26167	26169	The older man	585	“ Did you meet with the princess ? ”
26203	26234	26235	26236	His father	250	“ Yes . She was lovely , as promised . But , as I said , I ’m not ready to commit to a marriage of convenience . Not yet . ”
26239	26252	26235	26236	His father	250	“ I ’m not getting any younger . And the Princess of — ”
26253	26261	26262	26262	Leo	28	“ Are you so sure about that ? ”
26267	26288	26262	26262	Leo	28	“ I heard you beat Lord Marshall in an intense tennis match yesterday . The man is younger than me . ”
26295	26301	26289	26290	The king	274	“ Luck . Nothing more . ”
26302	26318	26319	26319	Leo	28	“ Well , I ’ll continue to count on that luck to keep you around , ”
26331	26341	26342	26343	His father	250	“ At least until I find the perfect wife . ”
26346	26362	26342	26343	His father	250	“ I ’ve been warned you are in a foul mood . Is this true ? ”
26363	26367	26372	26372	his	28	“ It is . ”
26368	26371	26372	26373	his father	250	“ Why ? ”
26451	26467	26482	26482	his	28	“ I did n’t sleep well last night . Could n’t shut my mind off . ”
26468	26478	26479	26479	he	28	“ And did something trigger this night of unease ? ”
26492	26498	26479	26479	he	28	“ A woman , perhaps ? ”
26512	26519	26521	26521	she	595	“ I spoke with Alicia again . ”
26537	26540	26541	26543	The other man	186	“ Ah . ”
26546	26558	26541	26543	The other man	186	“ I take it the conversation did not go as expected ? ”
26559	26567	26568	26568	Leo	28	“ Oh , it went as expected . ”
26575	26615	26568	26568	Leo	28	“ I expected it to be a failure , and it was . She has no desire to get to know me again , not after I brought her here under duress , and not after I betrayed her . ”
26620	26627	26568	26568	Leo	28	“ How did you betray her ? ”
26628	26645	26646	26646	Leo	28	“ She thinks I left her sitting at an airport , from what I can tell . ”
26656	26691	26646	26646	Leo	28	“ I have no idea what happened there , or how she got letters from me that I never wrote , but I ca n’t fix something I never did in the first place . ”
26692	26696	26697	26698	His father	250	“ I see . ”
26715	26722	26697	26698	His father	250	“ She told you as much ? ”
26723	26729	26646	26646	Leo	28	“ Yes . Over dinner . ”
26730	26738	26739	26740	his father	250	“ Then you need to try harder , ”
26753	26764	26739	26740	his father	250	“ Do something to win her over to your side . ”
26765	26796	26797	26797	he	28	“ Or I could let her go , and hope that someday she can look back on me fondly , despite my attempts at keeping her here against her will , ”
26810	26825	26797	26797	he	28	“ I think that ’s the only wise course of action at this point . ”
26826	26839	26739	26740	his father	250	“ You know it ’s too late for that . Our customs — ”
26840	26846	26847	26847	He	28	“ Are sexist and outdated . ”
26860	26871	26847	26847	He	28	“ And you know it as well as I do . ”
26872	26905	26906	26906	Father	53	“ True . But it is what it is . She ’s not the first woman to suffer her fate , and she wo n’t be the last , I ’m certain . ”
26909	26914	26906	26906	Father	53	“ Your own mother — ”
26915	26927	26928	26928	He	28	“ Was once in her shoes . Yes , I know . ”
26933	26949	26928	26928	He	28	“ She was from our country , and understood our customs . Alicia does not . ”
26957	26964	26950	26951	His father	250	“ You still like this woman ? ”
26994	26998	26986	26986	him	28	“ Of course . ”
26999	27010	27011	27012	his father	250	“ Maybe she ’s the woman you ’re waiting for ? ”
27028	27036	27011	27012	his father	250	“ The woman you intend to marry ? ”
27085	27092	27093	27093	Leo	28	“ She ’s not a princess , ”
27104	27124	27093	27093	Leo	28	“ Are you so desperate to see me married off that you ’ll forget your rich Princess Genevieve plan ? ”
27193	27202	27189	27190	His father	250	“ If it gets you settled ? Yes . ”
27203	27206	27207	27207	he	28	“ No , ”
27230	27263	27207	27207	he	28	“ I ’m not getting married . Not yet . I need to focus on this country and learning how to run it . I do n’t need anything else distracting me . ”
27264	27274	27275	27275	Leo	28	“ And yet you still wish to court Alicia ? ”
27295	27319	27290	27290	he	250	“ I like her , and I enjoy spending time with her , and want to be her friend . That ’s all . ”
27430	27449	27450	27451	his father	250	“ Then think of what made her like you , and vice versa , and then recreate it , ”
27458	27480	27450	27451	his father	250	“ And after you try again , bring her to me . I wish to dine with both of you tonight . ”
27481	27491	27492	27492	Leo	28	“ I do n’t know if she ’ll come , ”
27495	27509	27510	27510	He	250	“ She ’ll come . Just tell her I requested to see her … ”
27531	27546	27527	27527	he	250	“ After you do something romantic intended to win her over , that is . ”
27593	27620	27621	27623	The older man	585	“ All right . I ’ll do my best , but only if you go take a nap while I ’m out being ‘ romantic . ’ ”
27628	27634	27625	27625	his	585	“ I ’m not tired . ”
27635	27651	27652	27652	He	585	“ I do n’t care . You nap , or I do n’t try harder . ”
27657	27690	27652	27652	He	585	“ And I do n’t meet that other princess tomorrow , the one that you slipped into my schedule without telling me , even though you ’re clearly pushing for Princess Genevieve . ”
27700	27710	27652	27652	He	585	“ Very well , then . I ’ll nap . ”
27711	27714	27715	27715	Leo	28	“ Good . ”
27730	27748	27749	27749	Leo	28	“ Have you heard back yet from the former head of communications about those letters Alicia received ? ”
27753	27756	27749	27749	Leo	28	“ No . ”
27768	27792	27793	27793	He	585	“ Not yet . But do n’t worry , we ’ll find out what really happened , soon enough , I ’m sure . ”
27798	27803	27793	27793	He	585	“ Thanks , Dad . ”
27840	27891	27833	27833	he	250	“ I ’m fine . Stop worrying about me and go get your girl instead . I ’m not getting any younger , you know . And I ’d like to hold a grandchild in my arms before I die , whether it ’s through a princess or an American . ”
27901	27910	27898	27898	his	28	“ I ’m not marrying Alicia , Dad . ”
27911	27918	27919	27919	he	28	“ We ’ll see , son , ”
27944	27968	27934	27934	he	28	“ Now , do something that would impress me . Make this forced nap worth it , or you ’ll answer to me . ”
28161	28165	28166	28166	she	27	“ What now ? ”
28171	28181	28166	28166	she	27	“ We ’re going out , that ’s what . ”
28229	28236	28223	28223	she	27	“ Where are you taking me ? ”
28237	28246	28247	28247	She	27	“ You ’ll see when we get there . ”
28296	28301	28302	28302	He	28	“ But where — ? ”
28313	28324	28302	28302	He	28	“ Come with me if you want to find out . ”
28417	28420	28421	28421	she	27	“ Leo … ”
28429	28433	28421	28421	she	27	“ Come on . ”
28458	28494	28495	28495	She	27	“ You ’ve got to be bored out of your mind in that room all by yourself . Let ’s go live a little , maybe knock something else off that bucket list of yours . ”
28498	28510	28495	28495	She	27	“ I actually like being alone , just for the record . ”
28511	28518	28519	28519	His	28	“ I promise not to bite . ”
28550	28557	28558	28558	She	27	“ Unless you ask me to . ”
28574	28580	28566	28566	she	27	“ Not gon na happen . ”
28581	28600	28566	28566	she	27	“ Then you ’re perfectly safe with me . So why not go out and have some fun ? ”
28601	28614	28615	28615	she	27	“ I would , but you ’re the one asking me out , ”
28623	28637	28615	28615	she	27	“ And we both know you forgot how to have fun years ago . ”
28666	28672	28673	28673	he	28	“ So show me how , ”
28702	28721	28689	28689	she	27	“ All right . Curiosity was always my weakness . So … let ’s go have some fun . ”
28743	28749	28730	28730	he	28	“ Excellent , my lady . ”
28750	28753	28754	28754	She	27	“ Whoa . ”
28763	28771	28759	28759	her	27	“ You do remember how to smile . ”
28778	28781	28759	28759	her	27	“ Obviously . ”
28782	28794	28795	28795	She	27	“ Well , I have n’t seen evidence to support that . ”
28836	28856	28832	28832	she	27	“ There might be hope for you yet , Your Royal Pain - in - the - ass Highness . ”
28899	28917	28884	28884	She	27	“ I ’m not the only one who changed over the past ten years , you know . ”
28918	28925	28926	28926	she	27	“ I never said you were , ”
28977	28992	28954	28954	Her	27	“ But , out of curiosity , how do you think I ’ve changed ? ”
28993	29036	29037	29037	He	28	“ You ’re more closed off . More cautious . Aside from the night we spent together , before you found out who I was , you ’ve barely shown me anything other than cold indifference and a bit of sardonic humor . ”
29056	29113	29051	29051	They	144	“ Of course , that could be because I ’m holding you against your will , but still , from what you ’ve told me , you ’re not the girl who saw a boy skating across the rink , came over , and introduced herself before inviting him to come see her in The Nutcracker . ”
29148	29172	29144	29144	she	27	“ You ’re right . I ’m not that girl anymore , and that ’s a good thing , if you ask me . ”
29179	29182	29173	29173	He	28	“ Why ? ”
29183	29203	29204	29204	She	27	“ Because that girl was naive , and way too willing to believe in the good in this world . ”
29211	29218	29206	29206	her	27	“ She was also easily hurt . ”
29226	29233	29206	29206	her	27	“ And now you ’re not ? ”
29234	29249	29250	29250	She	27	“ Well , when you lose everyone you love , and you ’re alone — ”
29259	29272	29252	29252	her	27	“ You kind of realize it ’s better to stay that way . ”
29273	29276	29277	29277	he	28	“ Alone ? ”
29281	29284	29277	29277	he	28	“ Yeah . ”
29290	29298	29285	29285	She	27	“ It ’s just safer that way . ”
29337	29349	29368	29368	her	27	“ Since when is being safe so damn important to you ? ”
29350	29364	29365	29365	she	27	“ Since I grew up and realized it was better than being hurt , ”
29372	29380	29365	29365	she	27	“ It ’s just not worth it . ”
29454	29460	29461	29461	he	28	“ What happened to you ? ”
29465	29474	29461	29461	he	28	“ The same thing that happens to everyone . ”
29480	29483	29475	29475	She	27	“ Life . ”
29484	29493	29494	29494	he	28	“ Life does n’t have to harden you , ”
29505	29536	29537	29537	She	27	“ I disagree . I think it ’s a part of growing up . Life ’s disappointments are what make you stronger . They ’re what make you … you . ”
29586	29610	29569	29569	her	27	“ They ’re what make you survive , too . You take those lessons , and that pain , and learn from them . ”
29611	29620	29636	29636	her	27	“ What if someone you love hurts you ? ”
29621	29631	29632	29632	she	27	“ Then you never let them do it again , ”
29643	29659	29632	29632	she	27	“ And you do n’t give second chances to people who taught you a lesson . ”
29667	29683	29660	29660	He	28	“ That ’s a very black and white view in a world full of color . ”
29684	29694	29695	29695	she	27	“ The rest of the world might see colors , ”
29698	29704	29695	29695	she	27	“ But I do n’t . ”
29705	29713	29714	29714	Servants	66	“ Well , that ’s just sad . ”
29759	29763	29750	29750	he	28	“ Ladies first . ”
29823	29830	29813	29813	she	27	“ So where are we going ? ”
29831	29842	29815	29815	her	27	“ You really do n’t like surprises , do you ? ”
29843	29859	29860	29860	She	27	“ Last time I was in this car I was being abducted by a prince . ”
29867	29876	29860	29860	She	27	“ So I ’m a little cautious now . ”
29882	29930	29877	29877	He	28	“ Well , this time that asshole of a prince is taking you out , not locking you up . And , to be fair , you ’re free to roam the castle grounds and gardens . You ’re the one who refuses to leave your room . ”
29936	29947	29877	29877	He	28	“ How do you know that I have n’t left ? ”
29948	29953	29954	29954	He	28	“ Because I asked . ”
29966	30017	29954	29954	He	28	“ Do you honestly think I have n’t asked after your welfare the whole time you ’ve been here ? Every day , I ask how you ’re settling in . And every day , I ’m told you have n’t left your room , but are doing well otherwise . ”
30024	30034	30018	30018	She	27	“ That ’s because I choose not to leave . ”
30053	30071	30037	30037	his	28	“ Go to the library , at the very least . Do you still love to read ? ”
30072	30076	30077	30077	She	27	“ I do . ”
30088	30096	30077	30077	She	27	“ What are you doing with that ? ”
30097	30111	30112	30112	He	28	“ Throwing it out the window at my people , just for fun . ”
30117	30134	30112	30112	He	28	“ That ’s considered fun , right ? If not , I ’m a fuck up . ”
30155	30164	30144	30144	she	27	“ I never thought princes cursed so much . ”
30165	30172	30173	30173	He	28	“ Only with people I trust . ”
30178	30222	30173	30173	He	28	“ But , anyway , if I recall , an item on your bucket list was to get sloppy drunk , so I figured I might as well help you cross off another item , since you ’re stuck with me for now . ”
30223	30227	30228	30228	He	28	“ Oh God . ”
30231	30234	30228	30228	He	28	“ Scared ? ”
30235	30238	30239	30239	she	27	“ Never , ”
30248	30253	30239	30239	she	27	“ Give me some . ”
30254	30264	30265	30265	He	28	“ In a second . Oh , and here . ”
30293	30304	30305	30305	Her	27	“ I did n’t mean to keep this from you . ”
30324	30331	30310	30310	she	27	“ Oh , praise baby Jesus . ”
30332	30340	30341	30341	he	28	“ You missed it , I assume ? ”
30378	30385	30368	30368	she	27	“ God . That ’s awful . ”
30386	30390	30391	30391	He	28	“ I know . ”
30409	30418	30419	30419	She	27	“ That ’s what makes it so good . ”
30429	30435	30419	30419	She	27	“ If you say so . ”
30436	30444	30445	30445	he	28	“ You did n’t answer my question , ”
30451	30458	30445	30445	he	28	“ Did you miss your phone ? ”
30459	30475	30419	30419	She	27	“ Would n’t you miss yours if it was taken from you for four days ? ”
30476	30486	30487	30487	He	28	“ No , I do n’t think I would . ”
30500	30529	30487	30487	He	28	“ Truth be told , I ’d love for someone to take my phone from me for that long . To have some peace and quiet . But … ”
30590	30606	30583	30583	she	27	“ But sometimes you just wish you could escape , even for a short time ? ”
30607	30610	30583	30583	she	27	“ Yes . ”
30616	30621	30611	30611	He	28	“ Very much so . ”
30622	30627	30628	30628	She	27	“ I get that . ”
30649	30667	30628	30628	She	27	“ I think everyone , at one time or another , wishes that they could run away . ”
30704	30720	30698	30698	she	27	“ In New York , with you , I kind of got to feel anonymous . ”
30774	30783	30784	30784	she	27	“ Because you lied about who you were ? ”
30787	30796	30797	30797	He	28	“ No . Because I was with you . ”
30822	30894	30812	30812	She	27	“ With you , I was someone else . The same thing happened in that nightclub , and I feel it now , too . You bring out something in me that no one else does . I do n’t know why , or what it is , but with you , I can just … be me , and I do n’t have to pretend to be anything but that . ”
30928	30941	30942	30942	she	27	“ And that ’s not something you get to do a lot ? ”
30946	30949	30950	30950	he	28	“ No , ”
30967	30985	30958	30958	she	27	“ Well , that ’s just sad . You should be able to be yourself around anyone . ”
30986	31026	31027	31027	She	27	“ Guys like me , we ca n’t let our guard down unless it ’s with someone we trust . A spouse , a child , a father , or a sibling … only one of which I have . ”
31045	31055	31033	31033	her	27	“ You do n’t have any brothers or sisters ? ”
31056	31067	30958	30958	she	27	“ I told you in New York I did n’t . ”
31075	31085	31070	31070	she	27	“ I did n’t know if that was true . ”
31086	31144	31145	31145	He	646	“ I did n’t tell you any lies . I just did n’t tell you my real identity . If you ’d asked me back then if I was a prince , I would have told you the truth . But I liked that you did n’t know . That you treated me like a regular guy . ”
31157	31164	31154	31154	his	646	“ Everything we had was real . ”
31174	31177	31171	31171	she	647	“ Okay . ”
31206	31240	31201	31201	She	647	“ It ’s just me and Dad , so he ’s the only one I can talk to freely , which is probably why he wants me married off as soon as possible . ”
31244	31251	31241	31241	She	647	“ To that princess he likes . ”
31265	31268	31269	31269	He	646	“ Yeah . ”
31278	31306	31269	31269	He	646	“ I get it . He ’s worried that after he succumbs to his illness , I ’ll be alone and that I ’ll stay that way . ”
31307	31314	31315	31315	she	647	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
31325	31342	31315	31315	she	647	“ His heart . The doctors say he has a year , maybe two , left . ”
31371	31413	31360	31360	He	646	“ It ’s not something I like to dwell on , but it has forced me to realize that eventually I ’ll need to make some changes in my life for the good of the country — but mostly for him . ”
31464	31469	31454	31454	she	653	“ Such as … ? ”
31470	31477	31478	31478	He	646	“ Marriage . Babies . Princesses . ”
31485	31505	31478	31478	He	646	“ I ’ve been avoiding it until now , but once we know what ’s going on with us … ”
31580	31587	31575	31575	He	646	“ Who is she , then ? ”
31588	31593	31594	31594	he	646	“ Who is who ? ”
31636	31645	31646	31646	She	653	“ The lucky princess your father picked out . ”
31679	31702	31666	31666	he	646	“ The one who will bring money , and military force , and strength to your country , as well as herself . ”
31703	31710	31711	31711	He	646	“ Her name is Princess Genevieve . ”
31747	31788	31741	31741	he	646	“ She ’s nice enough , I suppose , but there ’s nothing there . I told you , unless you ’re a fan of shoes , you wo n’t have much in common . And there ’s no chemistry . ”
31789	31795	31796	31796	she	653	“ What do you mean ? ”
31805	31830	31796	31796	she	653	“ She does n’t make me ache so much that all I can think about is touching her . Kissing her . Having her . ”
31864	31904	31856	31856	he	646	“ She does n’t pull me apart with nothing more than a sarcastic comment that ’s meant to tear me to shreds but really only makes me want her more . She does n’t make me feel … anything . ”
31917	31920	31921	31921	He	646	“ Leo … ”
31928	31938	31923	31923	his	646	“ She does n’t make me feel like this . ”
32034	32046	32018	32018	She	653	“ Well , I ’m sure she ’s lovely , anyway . ”
32047	32050	32051	32051	He	646	“ Yeah . ”
32089	32092	32086	32087	Princess Genevieve	30	“ Lovely . ”
32164	32169	32143	32143	she	653	“ Alicia , I — ”
32170	32174	32175	32175	She	653	“ Ice cream ? ”
32210	32218	32204	32204	she	653	“ That ’s what we ’re doing ? ”
32240	32261	32234	32234	his	646	“ Not just any ice cream . The best ice cream in the whole country — maybe the whole world . ”
32309	32315	32320	32320	he	646	“ It ’s that good ? ”
32316	32319	32320	32320	he	646	“ Yes , ”
32336	32367	32320	32320	he	646	“ The kind of good that starts in your belly , and slowly spreads through every inch of your body until everything feels so amazing you just want to die . ”
32417	32424	32404	32404	She	653	“ That ’s pretty … descriptive . ”
32425	32429	32438	32438	he	646	“ Is it ? ”
32446	32452	32442	32442	She	653	“ So … ice cream . ”
32453	32456	32457	32457	He	646	“ Right . ”
32471	32477	32457	32457	He	646	“ Still like rocky road ? ”
32478	32491	32492	32492	she	653	“ I ’m more of a cookie dough kind of girl now , ”
32519	32528	32492	32492	she	653	“ Are you supposed to be back there ? ”
32529	32548	32549	32549	He	646	“ I asked permission . The owner agreed to give us a few hours alone in the shop . ”
32561	32583	32549	32549	He	646	“ I ’m going to make you my favorite sundae . It ’s a secret recipe that no one else knows . ”
32610	32617	32591	32591	she	653	“ You make your own sundaes ? ”
32618	32624	32625	32625	He	646	“ Of course I do . ”
32633	32641	32625	32625	He	646	“ Why do you sound so surprised ? ”
32642	32663	32664	32664	He	646	“ You have cooks . Maids . A valet . Everything you ’d see on Downton Abbey , and more . ”
32667	32671	32664	32664	He	646	“ Downton what ? ”
32672	32676	32677	32677	She	653	“ Never mind . ”
32682	32699	32677	32677	She	653	“ What I ’m saying is , you have people to do this stuff for you . ”
32700	32703	32711	32711	he	646	“ Yeah . ”
32728	32731	32711	32711	he	646	“ And ? ”
32732	32744	32677	32677	She	653	“ Annnnnd I would assume they make your sundaes for you . ”
32747	32780	32781	32781	He	646	“ Then you ’d assume wrong . Contrary to what you seem to think , just because I ’m a prince does n’t mean I ’m incapable of doing anything for myself . ”
32786	32799	32781	32781	He	646	“ I bet a lot of things I do would surprise you . ”
32828	32835	32812	32812	she	664	“ Oh yeah ? Like what ? ”
32836	32839	32840	32840	He	646	“ Like … ”
32850	32858	32840	32840	He	646	“ I work here once a month . ”
32864	32872	32859	32859	She	664	“ How do people not recognize you ? ”
32873	32883	32884	32884	He	646	“ Same way they did n’t in the club . ”
32889	32918	32884	32884	He	646	“ We wear hats , and I darken my hair to hide the blond so no one realizes who I am . It ’s a fun little escape . ”
32919	32926	32927	32927	she	664	“ I ’m sensing a theme , ”
32931	32937	32938	32938	he	646	“ What kind of theme ? ”
32959	32968	32969	32969	She	664	“ You ’re like Jasmine , in Aladdin . ”
32986	33004	33005	33005	He	646	“ You like to pretend to be normal , like everyone else , because you feel trapped . ”
33008	33020	33005	33005	He	646	“ I ’m not Jasmine , and I ’m not trapped . ”
33032	33051	33021	33021	He	646	“ Though I ’d look awesome in her little blue outfit and would love to have a tiger . ”
33052	33058	33059	33059	she	664	“ You ’ve watched Aladdin ? ”
33072	33079	33080	33080	he	646	“ My little cousins love Disney , ”
33086	33090	33080	33080	he	646	“ Especially Jasmine . ”
33091	33096	33021	33021	He	646	“ You have cousins ? ”
33097	33109	33110	33110	He	646	“ Yes . They ’re girls , ages eight and nine . ”
33115	33135	33110	33110	He	646	“ My mother ’s sister was twelve years younger than her , so it was a big age gap . ”
33136	33144	33145	33145	He	646	“ What else do the girls like ? ”
33148	33157	33145	33145	He	646	“ Putting nail polish and makeup on me . ”
33192	33201	33202	33202	He	646	“ What else do you let them do ? ”
33212	33225	33226	33226	he	646	“ Whatever the hell they want . It ’s a great escape — ”
33234	33241	33242	33242	she	664	“ Again , with the theme , ”
33246	33252	33242	33242	she	664	“ Yeah , I guess . ”
33261	33283	33253	33253	He	646	“ It ’s a great way to escape the stress of the office and the decisions I have to make there . ”
33284	33296	33242	33242	she	664	“ What ’s the last big decision you had to make ? ”
33297	33330	33331	33331	He	646	“ It was against a hostile nation to the west of us . If they do n’t back off on their missile testing , then we ’ll be forced to respond accordingly . ”
33340	33353	33331	33331	He	646	“ I have a feeling my warning wo n’t scare them off . ”
33357	33365	33354	33354	She	664	“ What happens if it does n’t ? ”
33366	33375	33376	33376	He	646	“ Then the United Nations will get involved . ”
33381	33395	33378	33378	his	646	“ And that possible contract with Baker might get a lot more necessary . ”
33396	33403	33404	33404	she	664	“ I hope it does n’t , ”
33444	33449	33450	33450	He	646	“ Me , too . ”
33494	33503	33486	33486	he	646	“ So , what ’s the secret ingredient ? ”
33504	33511	33512	33512	he	646	“ Remember our date at Serendipity ? ”
33564	33588	33553	33554	No one	157	“ We shared a ridiculously huge sundae , and drank sodas , and stayed until the shop closed and they kicked us out . ”
33609	33620	33621	33621	He	646	“ Yep . One thing that was on that sundae ? ”
33627	33630	33621	33621	He	646	“ These . ”
33637	33640	33621	33621	He	646	“ Nuts ? ”
33641	33647	33648	33648	He	646	“ Not just any nuts . ”
33658	33679	33648	33648	He	646	“ The same exact ones . I have them shipped to me once a year so I never run out . ”
33687	33690	33648	33648	He	646	“ Seriously ? ”
33691	33694	33695	33695	He	646	“ Yep . ”
33702	33711	33695	33695	He	646	“ This is one of my secret ingredients . ”
33727	33732	33718	33718	him	646	“ There ’s two ? ”
33733	33736	33737	33737	he	646	“ Yeah , ”
33741	33752	33737	33737	he	646	“ Why go through all that trouble for some nuts ? ”
33759	33784	33753	33753	He	646	“ Honestly ? Because every time I put them on a sundae , it takes me back to that date , and I smile . ”
33853	33866	33836	33836	she	664	“ So you think your nuts are so good they ’re orgasmic ? ”
33873	33876	33867	33867	He	646	“ Uh … ”
33877	33880	33881	33881	She	664	“ God . ”
33897	33904	33883	33883	her	664	“ You ’re such a dude . ”
33905	33926	33927	33927	he	646	“ What man in all of the world , in all of history , would not pause at that question ? ”
33941	33952	33932	33932	he	646	“ And , yes , my nuts are that good . ”
33953	33958	33959	33959	She	664	“ Well , then … ”
33980	33986	33977	33977	she	664	“ To your delicious nuts . ”
33987	33992	33993	33993	he	646	“ To my nuts , ”
34078	34083	34067	34067	she	664	“ Oh my God . ”
34084	34092	34093	34093	he	646	“ You found the other secret ingredient , ”
34108	34117	34100	34100	She	664	“ What kind of hot fudge is this ? ”
34118	34126	34127	34127	He	646	“ Salted caramel dark chocolate nut fudge . ”
34146	34153	34127	34127	He	646	“ It ’s my own recipe . ”
34154	34157	34158	34158	She	664	“ Seriously ? ”
34169	34175	34158	34158	She	664	“ You missed your calling . ”
34180	34183	34176	34176	He	646	“ Meaning ? ”
34184	34202	34203	34203	She	664	“ You should be selling this stuff , with this ice cream , and your fantastic nuts . ”
34213	34219	34203	34203	She	664	“ It ’s like crack . ”
34248	34272	34239	34239	he	646	“ My mother owned this shop , once upon a time , so I guess you could say it ’s in my blood . ”
34276	34280	34239	34239	he	646	“ She did ? ”
34281	34292	34293	34293	He	646	“ Yes . That ’s why I work here occasionally . ”
34306	34317	34293	34293	He	646	“ It makes me feel closer to her , somehow . ”
34365	34374	34350	34363	A man who missed his mother like that could n’t be all that bad	676	“ How old were you when she died ? ”
34375	34378	34379	34379	He	646	“ Twelve . ”
34422	34438	34419	34419	his	646	“ She was a good woman . A great queen . An even better mother . ”
34494	34500	34485	34485	she	664	“ I bet she was . ”
34501	34507	34508	34508	he	646	“ How old were you ? ”
34512	34522	34508	34508	he	646	“ Six . I do n’t really remember her . ”
34546	34558	34534	34534	his	646	“ She was shot on the subway on her way home . ”
34578	34584	34585	34585	He	646	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
34591	34596	34585	34585	He	646	“ That ’s awful . ”
34597	34600	34601	34601	she	664	“ Yeah , ”
34604	34609	34601	34601	she	664	“ Death always is . ”
34644	34689	34636	34636	he	646	“ We ’ve both lost too much , Alicia . Being here with you reminds me of what we had , all those years ago . And I ’m going to be honest and admit that I do n’t want to lose you again . ”
34745	34750	34751	34751	His	646	“ Leo , I — ”
34817	34833	34809	34809	He	646	“ It ’s my father . I have to take this . Do you mind ? ”
34839	34844	34834	34834	She	664	“ Of course not . ”
34845	34849	34850	34850	he	646	“ Thank you , ”
34868	34875	34854	34854	he	646	“ Dad ? Are you okay ? ”
34881	34896	34854	34854	he	646	“ I will . Did you get some rest before you got the call ? ”
34916	34919	34911	34911	She	664	“ Good . ”
34944	34954	34955	34955	He	28	“ Over my dead body . Bye , Dad . ”
34987	35001	35002	35002	She	664	“ My father is n’t able to join us for dinner after all . ”
35009	35015	35002	35002	She	664	“ Was he supposed to ? ”
35016	35027	35037	35037	her	664	“ Yes . I just had n’t asked you yet . ”
35028	35032	35037	35037	her	664	“ Why not ? ”
35040	35050	35033	35033	she	664	“ Because I figured you ’d tell me no . ”
35093	35099	35077	35077	He	28	“ You ’re probably right . ”
35100	35106	35107	35107	he	28	“ Can we just — ? ”
35110	35122	35123	35123	she	664	“ I told you , I do n’t do second chances , ”
35164	35204	35154	35154	He	28	“ I ’m not asking for a second chance . Because we ’re adults now , different from the kids we were back then . I ’m asking for a new chance , as the people we are now . ”
35226	35257	35258	35258	He	28	“ All I ’m asking for is an opportunity to prove you can trust the man I am now , even though the boy I was then let you down . ”
35291	35352	35353	35353	She	664	“ I want to show you my country , the way we ’d planned , and let you see why I love it as much as I do . I want you to love it , too . And most importantly ? I want to be your friend , Alicia . I think we could both use one of those . ”
35435	35451	35456	35456	his	682	“ Okay . I ’ll be your friend , Leo , but that ’s it . ”
35501	35508	35460	35460	he	682	“ You wo n’t regret this . ”
35704	35709	35690	35690	she	27	“ Oh . Hi . ”
35715	35721	35712	35712	she	664	“ Can I help you ? ”
35749	35761	35744	35744	he	28	“ I ’m here to take you on an another adventure . ”
35769	35773	35744	35744	he	28	“ What kind ? ”
35774	35788	35789	35789	His	28	“ One that needs sneakers along with that pretty dress you ’re wearing . ”
35813	35827	35807	35807	he	28	“ And , damn , Alicia . That ’s a pretty amazing dress . ”
35877	35880	35881	35881	she	664	“ Thanks , ”
35885	35888	35881	35881	she	664	“ Ready ? ”
35889	35892	35893	35893	She	664	“ Uh … ”
35931	35937	35919	35919	She	664	“ Where are we going ? ”
35941	35953	35938	35938	He	28	“ You know I ’m not going to tell you that . ”
35954	35959	35960	35960	She	664	“ Of course not . ”
35965	35976	35962	35962	her	664	“ You ’re having way too much fun with this . ”
35977	35990	35991	35991	She	664	“ And yet you accused me of having forgotten what fun was . ”
35994	35997	35991	35991	She	664	“ True . ”
35998	36005	36006	36006	He	28	“ Turns out , I remember . ”
36021	36033	36006	36006	He	28	“ Any time I get to spend with you is fun . ”
36039	36045	36046	36046	she	664	“ How ’s your father ? ”
36049	36056	36046	36046	she	664	“ Is he still in Greece ? ”
36081	36084	36085	36085	He	28	“ Yes . ”
36104	36112	36085	36085	He	28	“ He ’s in heaven right now . ”
36113	36117	36118	36118	she	664	“ How so ? ”
36122	36135	36118	36118	she	664	“ There are a ton of marriageable princesses and nobles lurking around . ”
36146	36161	36136	36136	She	664	“ Maybe if he ’s so fond of them , he should marry them . ”
36187	36194	36195	36195	She	664	“ I told him that once . ”
36227	36233	36217	36218	Commander Jonathon	50	“ What was his reply ? ”
36266	36300	36301	36301	She	664	“ He said there was only one wife for him , and he ’d see her again soon , so you could be sure he ’d be a free man when he did . ”
36311	36315	36301	36301	She	664	“ How romantic . ”
36316	36319	36322	36322	her	664	“ Yeah . ”
36556	36564	36544	36544	He	28	“ Would you pull over , please ? ”
36565	36571	36572	36573	The driver	707	“ Yes , Your Highness . ”
36579	36587	36588	36588	he	28	“ What ’s going on out there ? ”
36593	36604	36588	36588	he	28	“ The school is on a field trip , sir , ”
36613	36622	36605	36606	Commander Jonathon	50	“ Picking roses and picnicking in the fields . ”
36623	36627	36628	36628	he	28	“ How wonderful , ”
36644	36657	36628	36628	he	28	“ Did they not want to come to the palace , then ? ”
36658	36680	36681	36681	Jonathon	50	“ They were supposed to , but when your father had to leave , they cancelled that portion of the trip . ”
36684	36693	36681	36681	Jonathon	50	“ They were supposed to meet the king . ”
36694	36705	36706	36706	he	28	“ Well , why did n’t they meet me instead ? ”
36711	36721	36706	36706	he	28	“ You were in meetings all day , sir . ”
36929	36939	36925	36925	she	27	“ I love roses , too , you know . ”
36940	36946	36925	36925	she	27	“ Would you mind — ? ”
36957	36972	36949	36949	her	27	“ I ’d love to go pick roses and have a picnic with you . ”
37015	37036	37004	37004	he	28	“ You ’re the most beautiful person , inside and out , that I ’ve ever known , Alicia Forkes . ”
37103	37111	37112	37112	she	27	“ Ready to go have some fun ? ”
37115	37127	37128	37128	She	27	“ It was n’t what I planned , but those kids … ”
37131	37135	37140	37140	he	28	“ Those kids . ”
37169	37173	37174	37174	He	28	“ Your Highness . ”
37179	37185	37176	37176	his	28	“ Hello , Miss … ? ”
37186	37192	37193	37193	She	27	“ Grant . Ms. Grant . ”
37205	37219	37197	37197	her	27	“ I hope you were aware of our plans to be here — ? ”
37220	37224	37225	37225	he	28	“ Of course , ”
37241	37257	37225	37225	he	28	“ This is a business consultant from America , Alicia . Alicia , Ms. Grant . ”
37264	37270	37275	37275	her	360	“ Lovely to meet you . ”
37280	37285	37275	37275	her	360	“ Likewise , miss . ”
37286	37300	37301	37301	He	28	“ We saw the children having fun and simply could n’t resist stopping . ”
37308	37318	37301	37301	He	28	“ We have our own food , of course . ”
37324	37328	37319	37319	Alicia	27	“ Of course . ”
37340	37351	37330	37331	Ms. Grant	73	“ Children , line up ! The prince is here . ”
37425	37431	37432	37432	he	28	“ What ’s your name ? ”
37438	37441	37442	37442	she	27	“ Fiona , ”
37456	37460	37442	37442	she	27	“ Your Highness . ”
37461	37465	37466	37466	he	28	“ Perfect curtsy , ”
37478	37487	37475	37475	She	27	“ Perfect bow , too , Your Highness . ”
37501	37504	37488	37488	Alicia	27	“ Indeed . ”
37505	37511	37512	37512	he	28	“ Are you having fun ? ”
37531	37535	37536	37536	Fiona	74	“ We are , ”
37539	37545	37536	37536	Fiona	74	“ Do you like roses ? ”
37563	37572	37573	37573	he	28	“ A pretty rose for a pretty lady , ”
37595	37602	37584	37584	he	28	“ And for another pretty lady . ”
37644	37648	37649	37649	she	27	“ Thank you , ”
37657	37662	37652	37652	He	28	“ You ’re welcome . ”
37718	37728	37729	37729	She	27	“ You look like you have something to say . ”
37753	37773	37746	37746	her	27	“ You continue to surprise me is all , and I ’m not sure how I feel about that . ”
37774	37783	37784	37784	he	28	“ You know what I think it means ? ”
37827	37830	37816	37816	She	27	“ What ? ”
37831	37844	37816	37816	She	27	“ Maybe the world is n’t so black and white after all . ”
37871	37877	37851	37851	she	27	“ Maybe it ’s not . ”
38120	38152	38102	38102	he	28	“ And then the queen said , ‘ Honestly , Henry . I would have thought a king would be far too mature for pants covered in ducks in the bathtub . ”
38153	38158	38159	38159	She	27	“ Oh my God . ”
38166	38173	38159	38159	She	27	“ Were they wearing shower caps ? ”
38174	38178	38179	38179	he	28	“ Pink ones , ”
38184	38189	38179	38179	he	28	“ Oh , dear . ”
38190	38201	38202	38202	She	27	“ And he had a matching button - up shirt . ”
38254	38260	38236	38236	she	27	“ What did he say ? ”
38261	38288	38293	38293	she	27	“ He straightened his spine and said , ‘ Maybe you ’ve been married to the wrong type of king , then , Your Majesty . ’ ”
38301	38312	38293	38293	she	27	“ I can totally picture him saying that , too . ”
38468	38473	38462	38462	his	28	“ Where are we ? ”
38474	38479	38480	38480	She	27	“ The Royal Arena . ”
38505	38511	38487	38487	They	754	“ What are we doing ? ”
38512	38523	38524	38524	He	28	“ Come with me , and you ’ll find out . ”
38562	38571	38572	38572	She	27	“ Are you still a size six shoe ? ”
38578	38585	38572	38572	She	27	“ You remember my shoe size ? ”
38586	38595	38596	38596	he	28	“ I remember everything you ever told me , ”
38615	38619	38602	38602	he	28	“ Size six ? ”
38737	38740	38730	38730	she	27	“ Leo … ”
38741	38769	38730	38730	she	27	“ I still remember you wearing those ballerina tights , with your cheeks flushed from the cold and your laughter , but you just kept skating anyway . ”
38798	38828	38787	38787	his	28	“ You were so alive . So free . I envied that . And I just had to have a taste of that freedom for myself , through you . ”
38871	38883	38864	38864	she	27	“ I ca n’t believe you did all this for me . ”
38884	38922	38923	38923	He	28	“ Every time I hear classical music , it brings me back to that time I saw you on that stage , dancing your heart out . It was the most beautiful thing I ’d ever seen . ”
38939	38948	38923	38923	He	28	“ Do you still dance , my lady ? ”
38978	38981	38951	38951	her	27	“ No . ”
38982	38991	38998	38998	him	28	“ Why did you stop ? What happened ? ”
39139	39143	39144	39144	she	27	“ He died , ”
39148	39197	39144	39144	she	27	“ My father died . When you do n’t have a parent , you lose money for dance classes , and then you lose your home , and everything you hold dear . It ’s just … gone . You ’re alone , and no one cares anymore . ”
39219	39230	39231	39231	Young	761	“ How old were you when he died , Alicia ? ”
39236	39239	39231	39231	Young	761	“ Sixteen . ”
39240	39245	39246	39246	He	28	“ But that was — ”
39254	39263	39246	39246	He	28	“ That was the year after we met . ”
39264	39270	39271	39271	She	27	“ Six months , actually . ”
39285	39295	39326	39326	him	28	“ I wrote you and told you about it . ”
39296	39316	39326	39326	him	28	“ I did n’t get the letter . I swear on my crown , I did n’t get it . ”
39354	39367	39345	39345	she	27	“ Whatever . It was years ago . It ’s ancient history . ”
39368	39371	39372	39372	He	28	“ No . ”
39400	39436	39437	39437	She	27	“ It ’s not . You needed me , and I was n’t there , and it ’s never going to be okay . I should have written to you like I said I would . ”
39612	39624	39629	39629	him	763	“ Where did you go after he died ? Your grandmother ? ”
39666	39682	39660	39660	she	27	“ She ’s been dead as long as I can remember , so definitely not . ”
39683	39688	39689	39689	She	27	“ Then where — ? ”
39700	39757	39689	39689	She	27	“ It does n’t matter , does it ? I went somewhere , and then I went somewhere else , and then to another place , and another . Then that place , all those places , led me to here . With you . Right now . And that ’s all you need to know . ”
39758	39761	39762	39762	He	763	“ Alicia — ”
39829	39846	39820	39820	he	763	“ Please leave us , and do n’t come back in until I call for you . ”
39873	39880	39868	39868	He	763	“ Very well , Your Highness . ”
39962	39973	39953	39953	she	27	“ I dare you to take off your suit jacket . ”
39992	40009	39974	39974	He	28	“ I do n’t have a proper dress shirt on underneath . If someone saw me — ”
40010	40017	40018	40018	she	27	“ What are you wearing underneath ? ”
40030	40045	40046	40046	He	28	“ A Hello Kitty shirt ? Disney Princesses ? Transformers ? An American flag ? ”
40049	40052	40046	40046	He	28	“ Alicia . ”
40053	40058	40059	40059	She	27	“ Take it off . ”
40064	40069	40059	40059	She	27	“ I dare you . ”
40070	40073	40076	40076	he	28	“ I — ”
40112	40125	40096	40096	he	28	“ You really want to see what I ’m wearing under this ? ”
40126	40129	40130	40130	She	27	“ Yes . ”
40133	40140	40130	40130	She	27	“ I really , really do . ”
40158	40161	40162	40162	He	28	“ Fine . ”
40170	40183	40162	40162	He	28	“ But what are you going to take off , in return ? ”
40196	40199	40191	40191	she	27	“ Seriously ? ”
40200	40210	40211	40211	He	28	“ Well , I think it ’s only fair . ”
40239	40259	40260	40260	She	27	“ Gender equality and all that . From what I hear , you ’re big on being treated fairly . ”
40263	40269	40260	40260	She	27	“ Do you blame me ? ”
40270	40275	40276	40276	he	28	“ Not at all , ”
40283	40307	40276	40276	he	28	“ It ’s something I ’m working on in my office every day . Trying to get Randovia up to speed with America . ”
40356	40360	40347	40347	him	28	“ You are ? ”
40361	40364	40365	40365	He	28	“ Yes . ”
40368	40381	40365	40365	He	28	“ So what ’s it going be ? What ’s coming off ? ”
40382	40386	40387	40387	she	27	“ My shoes ? ”
40401	40410	40391	40391	He	28	“ No dice . The coat stays on . ”
40481	40492	40497	40497	his	28	“ Fine . I ’ll take mine off , too . ”
40509	40513	40502	40502	he	28	“ All right . ”
40514	40524	40502	40502	he	28	“ You were awfully quick to accept that offer . ”
40525	40536	40537	40537	he	28	“ I know a good deal when I see one , ”
40541	40545	40537	40537	he	28	“ On three ? ”
40571	40575	40562	40562	she	27	“ On three . ”
40576	40579	40580	40580	He	28	“ One . ”
40594	40597	40586	40586	she	27	“ Two . ”
40613	40616	40617	40617	He	28	“ Three . ”
40650	40653	40632	40632	He	28	“ Jesus . ”
40675	40687	40701	40701	he	28	“ I never said I did n’t have another shirt underneath . ”
40688	40700	40701	40701	he	28	“ I was well aware of the fact that you did , ”
40740	40752	40731	40731	She	27	“ If that even qualifies as a shirt , that is . ”
40783	40789	40791	40791	she	27	“ Of course it is . ”
40816	40826	40791	40791	she	27	“ And what ’s so wrong with that shirt ? ”
40827	40841	40842	40842	he	28	“ There ’s no royal crest , and it ’s short - sleeved , ”
40861	40871	40842	40842	he	28	“ I have to wear long sleeves in public . ”
40872	40877	40842	40842	he	28	“ Even in summer ? ”
40878	40881	40882	40882	He	28	“ Yes . ”
40892	40903	40882	40882	He	28	“ And it has to be buttoned up , too . ”
40923	40929	40908	40908	he	28	“ It ’s very important . ”
40966	40969	40957	40957	God	42	“ Rebel . ”
40970	40974	40975	40975	He	28	“ For you . ”
40991	40998	40999	40999	He	28	“ I can try to be . ”
41004	41010	41011	41011	He	28	“ I was , once . ”
41042	41047	41048	41048	She	27	“ Okay , twice . ”
41104	41107	41098	41098	he	28	“ Twice ? ”
41108	41115	41116	41116	He	28	“ The hallway in that nightclub . ”
41172	41210	41220	41220	She	27	“ I never have sex in public , with a woman who may or may not go tell the press about it afterward . The risk is higher than the reward . But then I saw you … ”
41239	41253	41220	41220	She	27	“ And you broke all your rules for a stranger in a mask . ”
41254	41266	41267	41267	He	28	“ Yeah , but only because I knew who you were . ”
41423	41426	41419	41419	he	28	“ Leo … ”
41870	41877	41878	41878	She	27	“ So , ice - skating . ”
41907	41920	41902	41902	She	27	“ I have n’t done this since that day we were together . ”
41930	41934	41935	41935	he	28	“ Why not ? ”
42017	42037	42014	42014	she	27	“ Dad died , and I moved , and all those things I did for fun just … stopped . ”
42090	42095	42096	42096	She	27	“ I ’m sorry . ”
42102	42108	42096	42096	She	27	“ For what , precisely ? ”
42109	42138	42139	42139	He	28	“ Everything . Not writing you , for never going back to the city to find you , and for taking you in that hallway like I did . ”
42145	42170	42171	42171	She	27	“ Also , for my actions afterward , in bringing you to the castle . I ’m sorry for it . All of it . ”
42209	42220	42201	42201	He	28	“ That ’s a lot of apologies in one breath . ”
42221	42229	42230	42230	He	28	“ I ’ve messed up a lot . ”
42248	42254	42230	42230	He	28	“ I can see that . ”
42329	42348	42349	42349	She	27	“ I stopped skating because I went into foster care , and it was n’t a good home . ”
42361	42371	42349	42349	She	27	“ After that , everything went downhill . Everything . ”
42420	42441	42349	42349	She	27	“ And that ’s when you wrote to me and ‘ I ’ told you to go to the airport ? ”
42442	42447	42448	42448	She	27	“ That was later . ”
42456	42460	42448	42448	She	27	“ Much later . ”
42461	42465	42466	42466	He	28	“ I see . ”
42478	42485	42466	42466	He	28	“ How much later , exactly ? ”
42486	42494	42495	42495	She	27	“ Two months after I ran away . ”
42509	42514	42495	42495	She	27	“ Ready to skate ? ”
42906	42909	42910	42910	she	27	“ Leo ? ”
42927	42934	42921	42921	he	28	“ Yes , I ’m ready . ”
42957	42992	42993	42993	She	27	“ You probably do n’t like this , but do n’t read too much into it . I just want to make sure I do n’t fall flat on my ass and embarrass myself . ”
43014	43025	43008	43008	her	27	“ Now that ’s something I ’d pay to see . ”
43026	43038	43039	43039	He	28	“ I ’m sure there are quite a few people who — ”
43125	43128	43129	43129	She	27	“ Oof . ”
43190	43204	43205	43205	Her	27	“ Oh my God . You hit your head . Are you okay ? ”
43308	43311	43312	43312	She	27	“ Leo . ”
43322	43325	43312	43312	She	27	“ Hello ? ”
43351	43357	43343	43343	she	27	“ You ’re so beautiful . ”
43418	43438	43405	43405	he	28	“ Why did n’t you come to the airport like you promised ? Everything would be so different now . ”
43439	43450	43451	43451	he	28	“ I would have come , if I ’d known , ”
43463	43500	43451	43451	he	28	“ I ’ll come from now on , no matter how far away you are , or how many years pass . If you call me , I ’ll be there for you . I promise . ”
43515	43526	43507	43507	her	27	“ It ’s too late for those types of promises . ”
43527	43542	43543	43543	he	28	“ It ’s never too late to make a promise you intend to keep , ”
43555	43599	43543	43543	he	28	“ And I swear to you , here and now , that I ’ll keep that promise , as surely as I ’m going to kiss you right now , because , damn it , Alicia , I need to fucking kiss you . ”
43953	43980	43981	43981	He	28	“ You have no idea how many times I ’ve dreamed of this , of having you in my arms , naked and writhing and mine . ”
43999	44035	44037	44037	his	28	“ After all these years , and all that time , the dream is back , and you ’re in my arms , and there ’s no way in hell I ’m letting you go . Never”—he
44050	44052	44037	44037	his	28	leggings—“again . ”
44053	44058	44037	44037	his	28	“ We should n’t — ”
44094	44101	44077	44077	He	28	“ Oh my God , yes . ”
44201	44239	44196	44196	he	28	“ You have no idea how hard it is not to take you right here , right now . But it would n’t be playing fair , and I refuse to play dirty with you ever again . ”
44365	44368	44343	44343	her	27	“ Yes . ”
44473	44478	44479	44479	She	27	“ I — I — ”
44508	44511	44502	44502	her	27	“ Leo . ”
44629	44657	44603	44603	he	28	“ It ’s taking all my control not to rip your pants off , flip you over , and slam into you . Just so you know . ”
44658	44664	44665	44665	She	27	“ What ’s stopping you ? ”
44690	44698	44680	44680	she	27	“ Why do n’t you want to ? ”
44699	44706	44707	44707	He	28	“ Oh , I want to . ”
44754	44804	44746	44746	he	28	“ But you do n’t trust me . Once I change that , and once you know I ’m not the type of guy to leave you standing there alone in an airport , then you ’re all fucking mine . And I ’m not losing you this time . ”
44813	44836	44808	44808	she	27	“ I ’m not … this was just a moment of weakness , a rekindled attraction . It does n’t mean anything . ”
44888	44895	44896	44896	he	28	“ Now who ’s the liar , ”
44999	45010	45011	45011	he	28	“ I believe I ordered you not to disturb us , ”
45017	45023	45011	45011	he	28	“ Leave us . Now . ”
45024	45028	45029	45030	Commander Jonathon	50	“ My prince , ”
45036	45065	45029	45030	Commander Jonathon	50	“ I ’m sorry , but I received word from the castle . It ’s your father . He … he … I ’m sorry , Your Highness . ”
45136	45139	45146	45147	Commander Jonathon	50	“ No . ”
45140	45145	45146	45147	Commander Jonathon	50	“ We must go , ”
45150	45153	45146	45147	Commander Jonathon	50	“ Quickly . ”
45154	45159	45166	45166	he	28	“ Is he dead ? ”
45178	45183	45160	45160	Leo	28	“ Do we know ? ”
45184	45220	45221	45221	He	28	“ I ’m uncertain . He came home , claimed he was tired and wanted to rest , and then collapsed . He ’s being brought on the private helicopter to Holy Mother ’s Hospital . ”
45239	45255	45233	45233	his	28	“ We ’ll wait out here for you to … get dressed , Your Highness . ”
45296	45299	45300	45300	Alicia	27	“ Leo . ”
45327	45338	45300	45300	Alicia	27	“ Stay positive . We do n’t know anything yet . ”
45339	45344	45300	45300	Alicia	27	“ Yeah . Okay . ”
45472	45492	45493	45493	He	28	“ Do n’t read too much into it . I just want to make sure you do n’t fall . ”
45499	45513	45493	45493	He	28	“ I ca n’t lose him , Alicia . I ’m not ready . ”
45514	45534	45539	45539	she	27	“ We ’re never ready , but you have n’t lost him yet . Do n’t give up hope . ”
45550	45559	45545	45545	he	28	“ Let ’s go be with your father . ”
45824	45827	45828	45828	he	28	“ Shit , ”
45831	45838	45828	45828	he	28	“ The reporters are already here . ”
45874	45882	45883	45883	He	28	“ What do you want to do ? ”
45908	45945	45900	45905	the guard who rode up front	832	“ We ’ll take you around the back , but there will likely be a few of them there , too . Will Ms. Forkes be staying in the car , or going inside with you ? ”
45955	45958	45951	45951	his	28	“ I … ”
45969	45993	45964	45964	she	27	“ I ’ll go in with you , if you want . For support . I ’d like to be there for you . ”
46107	46116	46097	46097	He	28	“ You do n’t have to do that . ”
46117	46120	46121	46121	she	27	“ But — ”
46124	46135	46121	46121	she	27	“ Would you like us to take Ms. Forkes home ? ”
46169	46197	46166	46166	His	28	“ Yes , please . We do n’t need people asking questions about her … or digging into her past . It ’s going to be zoo . ”
47011	47013	47000	47001	The guard	394	“ Miss. ”
47014	47018	47019	47019	she	865	“ Thank you , ”
47030	47047	47019	47019	she	865	“ Can you please let me know how the king is faring , once you hear ? ”
47052	47064	47048	47049	The man	147	“ Indeed . I ’ll be anxiously awaiting updates , myself . ”
47065	47074	47075	47075	she	865	“ I ’m sorry that he ’s ill , ”
47084	47091	47092	47093	The guard	394	“ He ’s a good man . ”
47111	47117	47092	47093	The guard	394	“ You spoke with him ? ”
47118	47129	47130	47130	She	865	“ Many years ago , when he came to America . ”
47141	47169	47170	47171	The guard	394	“ We met back then , Leo — I mean , the prince , and I. We spent a lot of time together in New York City . ”
47178	47193	47170	47171	The guard	394	“ How long ago was this , if you do n’t mind my asking ? ”
47194	47198	47228	47228	his	394	“ Ten years . ”
47199	47202	47203	47204	the guard	394	“ Interesting , ”
47218	47221	47203	47204	the guard	394	“ What ? ”
47222	47225	47226	47226	He	394	“ Nothing . ”
47245	47250	47228	47228	his	394	“ Nothing at all . ”
47262	47273	47257	47257	she	865	“ Again , let me know when you hear something . ”
47274	47283	47284	47284	He	394	“ I ’ll send word when I can . ”
47299	47301	47295	47295	he	394	“ Miss. ”
47700	47747	47750	47750	she	865	“ He was fine earlier . I ’d talked to him on the phone before he took off . He was joking with me , and telling me , like usual , that I needed to get married , and he was … he was fine . ”
47802	47807	47831	47831	he	28	“ Is he … ? ”
47808	47830	47831	47831	he	28	“ After I left the hospital , I could n’t think of anywhere else I wanted to be than with you , ”
47877	47896	47897	47897	His	28	“ I did n’t even get to tell him I loved him one last time before … before … ”
47904	47908	47897	47897	His	28	“ He knows . ”
47946	47953	47954	47954	He	28	“ Believe me , he knows . ”
48131	48138	48139	48139	She	865	“ I ’m sorry , Leo . ”
48158	48164	48139	48139	She	865	“ So , so sorry . ”
48962	48965	48973	48973	he	28	“ Alicia … ”
49154	49159	49144	49144	He	28	“ Look at me . ”
49172	49179	49166	49166	she	865	“ This is n’t just sex . ”
49213	49264	49206	49206	he	28	“ Right here , right now , you ’re mine , and I ’m yours , and this connection between us is real . This is us , and you ca n’t say you do n’t feel it , too . Do n’t deny me again . Not right now . ”
49279	49286	49265	49265	She	865	“ I feel it , too . ”
49393	49396	49397	49397	he	28	“ Condom ? ”
49500	49508	49488	49488	he	28	“ I ’m not losing you again . ”
49552	49557	49533	49533	they	908	“ Jesus , Alicia . ”
49820	49828	49829	49829	She	865	“ Oh my — gah . Stop . ”
49841	49851	49829	49829	She	865	“ Do n’t stop . Do n’t you dare — ”
49871	49874	49863	49863	she	865	“ Leo . ”
50039	50048	50049	50049	she	865	“ This does n’t have to change anything , ”
50053	50100	50049	50049	she	865	“ I feel you tensing up , and a million thoughts are probably going through your head , and you said a lot of stuff , but that ’s all it was . It was just pretty words , and amazing sex . That ’s it . ”
50202	50208	50209	50209	he	28	“ If you say so , ”
50222	50226	50227	50227	She	865	“ I do . ”
50234	50322	50227	50227	She	865	“ I mean , it was wonderful , and you ’ll always be … special … to me . But you ’re a king now , and with that comes responsibilities , and I do n’t fit … I’m not one of them , you know ? Once this is over , I ’ll go back to America , and you ’ll stay here and marry Princess whatever her name was , and run your country , and that ’s just how it ’s going to be . ”
50323	50337	50338	50338	he	28	“ You ’ve got it all figured out already , have n’t you ? ”
50371	50379	50347	50347	she	865	“ You know how it all ends ? ”
50380	50385	50386	50386	She	865	“ Well , yeah . ”
50433	50441	50460	50460	he	28	“ We both know what this was . ”
50442	50445	50446	50446	He	28	“ Oh ? ”
50469	50478	50448	50448	his	28	“ And what , exactly , is that ? ”
50479	50493	50494	50494	She	865	“ I was trying to make you feel better . To comfort you . ”
50507	50535	50494	50494	She	865	“ When my father died , I needed that , too . Comfort . I wanted to do that for you , for old time ’s sake . ”
50758	50761	50762	50762	he	28	“ Shit , ”
50799	50806	50807	50807	She	919	“ I ’m a fucking idiot . ”
50814	50822	50807	50807	She	919	“ Leo , I did n’t mean — ”
50823	50925	50926	50926	She	919	“ Do n’t backtrack now . I heard you , loud and clear . And for the first time , I ’m actually listening . You ’re not interested in getting to know me again , or in picking up where we left off , or in any of that . You do n’t want me to kiss you , or touch you , or fuck you . You just want to go home , and put this whole mess behind you , like the first time we parted ways . You just want to go back to forgetting I exist . ”
50941	50945	50935	50935	she	919	“ I never — ”
50946	50953	50954	50954	he	921	“ So you can do that , ”
50958	50963	50954	50954	he	921	“ You can go . ”
50970	50973	50964	50964	She	919	“ Seriously ? ”
50974	50977	50978	50978	He	921	“ Absolutely . ”
50984	50990	50978	50978	He	921	“ Go home , Alicia . ”
51016	51019	51005	51005	she	919	“ Leo — ”
51094	51133	51134	51134	he	921	“ I get it now . I understand why you wo n’t forgive me , or even attempt to forgive me . It ’s not because you ca n’t , it ’s because you do n’t want to , ”
51152	51254	51134	51134	he	921	“ I was a fool to think I could win your trust back , because you never trusted me in the first place . And I was even more of an idiot to think that what we have between us , what you make me feel , could maybe turn into love again , because you never loved me , either . Love , real love , is n’t like this . Love is n’t one sided , and it does n’t just die off because you ’re mad at the person you supposedly love . Love does n’t fucking die . ”
51269	51305	51264	51264	He	921	“ According to you , we just wanted to fuck each other because we have fond memories , and we did that , so I ’m done trying for more . We ’re done here . ”
51369	51392	51366	51366	he	921	“ Looks like you can cross another item off your bucket list , after all . You broke my heart . Congratulations . ”
51776	51780	51781	51781	she	27	“ Come in , ”
51804	51809	51810	51810	She	27	“ Leo , I — ”
51831	51844	51845	51846	The man	147	“ Oh . Sorry . I thought … Can I help you ? ”
51873	51910	51911	51911	Leopold	28	“ As you know , things have changed here . The king is dead , and Prince Leopold … it ’s going to be a rough couple of months for him , to say the least . ”
51962	51983	51957	51957	he	147	“ Yes , I ’d imagine so . My sympathies are with him . His father was a good man . ”
51984	51990	51991	51992	The man	147	“ Yes . He was . ”
51997	52011	51994	51994	his	147	“ I ’m Harry , by the way . Prince Leopold ’s advisor . ”
52012	52016	52017	52017	she	27	“ Alicia Forkes , ”
52021	52029	52017	52017	she	27	“ Nice to meet you , Harry . ”
52039	52042	52034	52034	his	147	“ Indeed . ”
52075	52095	52062	52062	he	147	“ Is there something I can help you with ? Did Leo — Prince Leopold — send you here ? ”
52096	52099	52100	52100	He	147	“ No . ”
52103	52111	52100	52100	He	147	“ Well , yes . He did . ”
52115	52118	52100	52100	He	147	“ Okay ? ”
52119	52163	52164	52164	He	147	“ I ’m here to help you pack and to escort you to the car that ’s waiting for you . He thanks you for your cooperation and invites you to visit in the future , though I ’d rather you did n’t . ”
52188	52194	52170	52171	three servants	939	“ What are they doing ? ”
52195	52204	52205	52205	Harry	43	“ Speeding along the process , of course , ”
52212	52215	52209	52210	a jerk	472	“ But … ”
52349	52353	52346	52346	she	27	“ I thought — ”
52354	52361	52362	52362	he	147	“ He ’s changed his mind , ”
52378	52397	52362	52362	he	147	“ Though he wishes you to keep him informed of the outcome of … well , you know . ”
52405	52416	52398	52398	She	27	“ Yeah . Sure . I ’ll let him know . ”
52417	52420	52421	52421	Harry	43	“ Excellent . ”
52430	52443	52425	52425	his	147	“ He ’ll be pleased with your cooperation , I ’m sure . ”
52451	52466	52425	52425	his	147	“ May I speak to him before I go ? I just want to — ”
52467	52481	52482	52482	he	147	“ I ’m sorry , but we do n’t think that ’s wise , ”
52496	52507	52490	52490	he	147	“ We think it ’s best if you leave quietly . ”
52518	52521	52510	52510	she	27	“ We ? ”
52522	52527	52528	52528	He	147	“ The prince ’s … ”
52535	52541	52533	52533	himself	147	“ The king ’s team . ”
52548	52554	52542	52542	She	27	“ And why is that ? ”
52555	52610	52611	52611	He	147	“ There ’s no doubt that he has old feelings for you , but with his royal lineage , we ca n’t afford to have you hanging around , clouding his judgment in his future affairs , and mucking up his search for an appropriate wife to join him as he begins his reign . ”
52620	52647	52611	52611	He	147	“ Now , more than ever , it is important his mind remain clear . He must keep his eyes focused on the future of Randovia . ”
52648	52660	52542	52542	She	27	“ And you ’re afraid I ’ll interfere with those things ? ”
52661	52685	52611	52611	He	147	“ Possibly . He knows what he has to do for his country , and what his duties are . But if you ’re here”—Harry
52686	52723	52542	52542	She	27	shrugged—“those duties might go unattended , and we ca n’t afford to risk that for a girl who used to live in her car in New York City . I ’m sure you understand our stance . ”
52784	52795	52805	52805	his	274	“ I want to speak with Leo before I go . ”
52796	52800	52801	52801	he	274	“ Absolutely not , ”
52816	52869	52805	52805	his	274	“ King Leopold has no interest in seeing you again , hence my presence here instead of his , and you need to return to your life in Harlem , Ms. Forkes . To your job at Baker … who , if you must know , is quite happy with your work . ”
52873	52877	52805	52805	his	274	“ What work ? ”
52878	52888	52889	52889	He	274	“ You secured a contract with the royal guard . ”
52904	52938	52889	52889	He	274	“ Congratulations . Your powers of … persuasion … were apparently very strong , because the king himself approved the contract just this morning , and ignored all competing offers from other companies . ”
52997	53000	53001	53001	He	274	“ But — ”
53013	53050	53003	53003	his	274	“ I ’m not finished yet . The king also thanks you for staying and wants you to consider the Baker contract to be a token of his appreciation for all you ’ve done for him . ”
53131	53147	53148	53148	She	944	“ You can tell him he can shove the contract up his — never mind . ”
53174	53181	53162	53163	the workers	335	“ I do n’t want it . ”
53182	53200	53201	53201	He	274	“ It ’s already done . Your bosses have been informed , and so have the competitors . ”
53215	53240	53208	53208	his	274	“ And your time here is , too . Go back to Harlem , Ms. Forkes . It ’s where people like you belong . ”
53241	53252	53253	53253	She	944	“ Wow . You ’re a real asshole , Harry . ”
53261	53286	53253	53253	She	944	“ I ’m going , but no one speaks to me like that . Does Leo know you talk to his guests that way ? ”
53291	53310	53287	53288	The man	147	“ If his advisors are like you , I worry about him and the future of his country . ”
53382	53402	53407	53407	his	147	“ Look at it this way . You might not be living in the lap of luxury in the palace anymore”—he
53408	53426	53407	53407	his	147	breath—“but at least you ’re not living in your car and showering in school locker rooms anymore . ”
53427	53455	53456	53456	She	944	“ Yeah . You ’re absolutely right . But I ’d rather be there , in my car , then stay in your company for another second . ”
53482	53500	53474	53474	she	944	“ And no matter what happens when I leave here , one thing wo n’t ever change . ”
53501	53507	53508	53508	he	147	“ What might that be ? ”
53515	53524	53525	53525	She	944	“ The fact that you ’re an asshole . ”
53536	53542	53525	53525	She	944	“ And always will be . ”
53543	53559	53560	53560	She	944	“ Better an asshole in a castle , than a street rat in fancy clothes . ”
53701	53718	53719	53719	He	28	“ How do you know about me living in a car and showering in locker rooms ? ”
53724	53732	53719	53719	He	28	“ The king told me about it . ”
53733	53736	53737	53737	she	944	“ When ? ”
53765	53771	53759	53759	she	944	“ I did n’t mention — ”
53772	53795	53796	53796	Harry	43	“ A few years ago , he read your letters to me over a mug of ale one night , for laughs , ”
53805	53832	53796	53796	Harry	43	“ He left you standing at La Guardia , waiting for him to come rescue you at five o’clock at night , if I recall correctly . ”
53884	53929	53867	53867	Harry	43	“ He sent you instructions to show up at La Guardia , go to the Randovia Airlines desk , and pick up tickets in his name . But instead of tickets , you found a note telling you to never write to him again . ”
53978	53981	53953	53953	he	28	“ I … ”
53982	53995	53996	53996	He	28	“ Even then he knew you were n’t good enough for him . ”
54020	54035	53998	53998	his	28	“ Why do you think he ’s not here to see you off today ? ”
54055	54074	54049	54050	the man	147	“ You did n’t believe him when he told you he never got your letters , did you ? ”
54090	54113	54080	54080	he	28	“ Oh , that ’s just rich . You fell for that ridiculous lie ? You deserve anything you get , then . ”
54114	54119	54120	54120	she	944	“ Go to hell , ”
54127	54137	54120	54120	she	944	“ And take your precious little prince with you . ”
54138	54141	54142	54142	he	28	“ King , ”
54195	54198	54199	54199	Leo	28	“ Alicia . ”
54209	54216	54199	54199	Leo	28	“ What ’s going on here ? ”
54224	54227	54220	54220	his	43	“ My — ”
54228	54233	54238	54238	his	28	“ You … You … ”
54272	54277	54263	54263	she	944	“ Go to hell . ”
54290	54297	54278	54278	Leo	28	“ What ’s going on here ? ”
54298	54304	54305	54305	she	944	“ I ’m finally leaving , ”
54309	54314	54305	54305	she	944	“ You pompous asshole . ”
54320	54328	54305	54305	she	944	“ We ’re back to this now ? ”
54329	54337	54338	54338	Harry	43	“ I ’m sorry for this scene . ”
54351	54360	54338	54338	Harry	43	“ She was just leaving , Your Highness . ”
54368	54372	54373	54373	he	28	“ Release her , ”
54391	54408	54409	54409	Harry	43	“ And never grab her like that again , if you value your life at all . ”
54412	54415	54409	54409	Harry	43	“ But — ”
54416	54420	54421	54421	His	28	“ Leave us . ”
54426	54429	54421	54421	His	28	“ Now . ”
54466	54476	54477	54477	Leo	28	“ I ’m sorry for his behavior toward you , ”
54492	54500	54501	54501	Leo	28	“ Everyone leave us . Except you , ”
54509	54520	54501	54501	Leo	28	“ You may wait in the car for Ms. Forkes . ”
54559	54572	54573	54573	He	28	“ Scared they ’ll hear you talking to a peasant like me ? ”
54576	54585	54573	54573	He	28	“ What ? No . Of course not . ”
54586	54623	54624	54624	she	971	“ Oh , just admit that you do n’t want to be seen with me in public , because they ’ll know who and what I am , and you ca n’t be associated with that , ”
54628	54645	54624	54624	she	971	“ I mean , what if people found out you slept with a girl like me ? ”
54650	54662	54624	54624	she	971	“ I have no idea why you ’re saying these things . ”
54663	54689	54573	54573	He	28	“ Sure you do . And , hey , I understand now why you did n’t want me at the hospital . I get it . ”
54704	54782	54697	54697	he	28	“ First of all , that ’s not why I did n’t bring you with me to the hospital . And second of all , it ’s my job to always be above reproach , to never lose my head , and allowing you to call me names in an outburst of emotion in front of my men is n’t acceptable . It causes a scene I ca n’t afford to be caught up in right now . ”
54783	54790	54791	54791	She	972	“ Well , do n’t worry . ”
54798	54820	54791	54791	She	972	“ As soon as I get in that car , you ’ll never be embarrassed by my outbursts of emotion again . ”
54821	54826	54827	54827	he	28	“ You ’re leaving , ”
54831	54839	54827	54827	he	28	“ Yep . Just like you wanted . ”
54857	54881	54882	54882	She	972	“ I never wanted that , and you know it . I wanted you to stay , so we could get to know — ”
54887	54896	54882	54882	She	972	“ Oh , drop the act all ready . ”
54897	54900	54901	54901	He	28	“ I — ”
54921	54925	54901	54901	He	28	“ What act ? ”
54926	54942	54943	54943	she	972	“ I know you got my letters , and you laughed about them with Harry , ”
54946	54952	54943	54943	she	972	“ He told me everything . ”
54996	55026	55052	55052	his	28	“ You must have misunderstood him . I would never laugh at you like that , and as I ’ve said — repeatedly — I never got your letters . ”
55037	55043	55032	55032	she	972	“ If you say so . ”
55044	55048	55049	55049	he	28	“ I do , ”
55066	55093	55058	55058	He	28	“ Then tell me how he knew what I wrote to you , and what you wrote back to me , if you never did it ? ”
55094	55099	55100	55100	He	28	“ I do n’t — ”
55123	55133	55117	55117	her	972	“ Of course . I ’m a fucking idiot . ”
55134	55163	55164	55164	She	972	“ No arguments there . But , hey , so was I for falling for your tricks when you swore you had no idea where my letters went . ”
55171	55208	55164	55164	She	972	“ But I ’ll be on my way , now that I ’ve been given the royal permission to go . Your pal Harry made it very clear I ’m not good enough to hang here . ”
55214	55217	55209	55209	He	28	“ Alicia — ”
55218	55227	55228	55228	She	972	“ And do n’t worry about your car . ”
55244	55264	55265	55265	she	972	“ I have n’t lived in one since senior year , so it ’ll come back safe and sound , ”
55273	55278	55265	55265	she	972	“ That ’s not — ”
55288	55293	55281	55281	he	28	“ You did that ? ”
55294	55299	55300	55300	she	972	“ Knock it off , ”
55335	55341	55327	55327	he	28	“ Just knock it off . ”
55342	55349	55350	55350	he	28	“ You lived in your car ? ”
55354	55361	55362	55362	she	972	“ Just like I told you , ”
55365	55370	55362	55362	she	972	“ in my letters . ”
55371	55379	55380	55380	he	28	“ I never got your fucking letters ! ”
55387	55402	55380	55380	he	28	“ Jesus . What is it going to take for you to believe me ? ”
55422	55441	55407	55407	she	972	“ Should I curtsey as I leave , or am I exempt from that , as an American ? ”
55460	55518	55442	55442	He	28	“ You ’re so quick to believe the worst of me , to think I could callously use you and lie to you , yet you ’re the one running away because you refuse to see the good in anyone else . You wo n’t take a risk on someone who may or may not hurt you . ”
55519	55526	55527	55527	she	972	“ You told me to go , ”
55530	55560	55527	55527	she	972	“ Had them pack up my clothes , pick up my bags , and carry them out the door . So do n’t act all surprised I ’m leaving . ”
55561	55570	55571	55571	He	974	“ I did n’t tell him to do — ”
55582	55597	55573	55573	himself	974	“ You know what ? Never mind . You would n’t believe me anyway . ”
55598	55602	55603	55603	she	972	“ Believe what ? ”
55650	55666	55667	55667	he	974	“ I was merely giving you what you wanted when I told you to go , ”
55673	55683	55667	55667	he	974	“ Or is that not what you want anymore ? ”
55684	55701	55702	55702	she	972	“ What I want is for you to tell the truth for once in your life , ”
55722	55771	55712	55712	He	974	“ You do n’t want to hear the truth . No matter what I say , you ’ll believe the worst of me . I ’m done defending myself when I have n’t done anything wrong . Go . Leave . Clearly there ’s nothing worth saving here . ”
55772	55777	55797	55797	him	974	“ I … I … ”
55932	55935	55936	55936	she	972	“ Hell , ”
55973	55982	55965	55965	she	972	“ Go ! Go , go , go ! ”
56157	56160	56161	56161	Leo	28	“ I — ”
56169	56172	56161	56161	Leo	28	“ Silence . ”
56184	56191	56192	56192	he	28	“ Why did you do it ? ”
56199	56215	56216	56216	Harry	43	“ I asked Alicia to leave so you would n’t have to , Your Highness , ”
56225	56240	56216	56216	Harry	43	“ You said this morning she was free to go , so I simply — ”
56241	56259	56260	56260	Harry	43	“ So you packed up her belongings and pushed her out the door , without telling me ? ”
56265	56274	56260	56260	Harry	43	“ For your own benefit , of course . ”
56275	56278	56279	56279	He	43	“ Bullshit . ”
56298	56311	56279	56279	He	43	“ That was n’t for my benefit , and you know it . ”
56312	56329	56330	56330	Harry	43	“ The team decided it was best for her to exit quietly , all things considered . ”
56335	56364	56330	56330	Harry	43	“ With your father gone , there ’s a lot on your mind , and we did n’t want you to have any undue stress because of her . ”
56382	56405	56379	56379	his	43	“ And that ’s also why you wrote to her , all those years ago , and left her at the airport . ”
56406	56411	56412	56412	Harry	43	“ Yes , I — ”
56423	56439	56412	56412	Harry	43	“ I … uh … I do n’t know what you mean , Your Highness . ”
56440	56450	56451	56451	Leo	28	“ Who decided she was n’t worth the trouble ? ”
56465	56479	56451	56451	Leo	28	“ Who made that call for me , without asking what I wanted ? ”
56480	56489	56412	56412	Harry	43	“ I do n’t know what you ’re — ”
56509	56521	56499	56499	he	28	“ Yes , it was me . I wrote those letters . ”
56522	56529	56451	56451	Leo	28	“ Who . Ordered . It ? ”
56530	56534	56535	56535	Harry	43	“ Your father . ”
56544	56598	56541	56541	Leo	28	“ He regretted it afterward , though . That ’s why he specifically requested Baker send in Alicia when they inquired after sending an agent over . He felt bad , and after keeping tabs on her for the past ten years , he decided to try to make amends for his actions . ”
56618	56624	56599	56599	Leo	28	“ But he liked Alicia . ”
56625	56629	56630	56630	Harry	43	“ He did . ”
56636	56706	56630	56630	Harry	43	“ But you two were so young , and she was a risk your father was n’t willing to take . But as more time passed and you still refused to accept anyone else as your wife , he thought maybe he made a mistake back then . I do n’t . I think it was the right call . She ’s not a fit queen for this country . ”
56707	56711	56712	56712	Leo	28	“ You think ? ”
56724	56761	56762	56762	Harry	43	“ Despite my assurances he did the right thing , he gave her a scholarship to school , and watched over her , kept her off the streets once he realized she was living on them . ”
56772	56782	56762	56762	Harry	43	“ So he did n’t leave her life completely . ”
56783	56790	56791	56791	Leo	28	“ He paid for her schooling ? ”
56798	56821	56822	56822	Harry	43	“ Yes . She does n’t know , and never will , but he felt bad for not bringing her over here . ”
56825	56845	56822	56822	Harry	43	“ He was going to tell you , and her , too , even though I advised against it . ”
56897	56910	56888	56888	he	250	“ Why did he tell you about this , and not me ? ”
56911	56928	56929	56929	Harry	43	“ He enlisted my help in writing to her back then , in sounding like you . ”
56934	56956	56931	56931	his	43	“ My king asked me to help him , and I did it with gratitude . It was the right call . ”
57005	57011	57012	57012	he	28	“ Call my car around , ”
57023	57030	57018	57018	Harry	43	“ You ’re going after her . ”
57046	57051	57052	57052	Harry	43	“ Yeah . And ? ”
57061	57080	57054	57054	his	43	“ She ’s not a princess . Nothing will change the fact that you ca n’t marry her . ”
57081	57115	57116	57116	Leo	28	“ As an advisor for my father , you should have been aware that my father passed a new law , six months ago . I do n’t need to marry a princess . ”
57121	57198	57118	57118	his	28	“ But I highly doubt that she ’s looking to marry me , since she thinks I ’m a guy who would kick her out of my house without a moment ’s notice . That I ’m the same boy who left her at the airport when she was orphaned and destitute . Yeah , Harry , I ’m sure I ’m high on her list of guys she even wants to talk to right now . ”
57219	57225	57226	57226	Harry	43	“ My car . Now ! ”
57233	57241	57226	57226	Harry	43	“ I ’ll have it brought around . ”
57242	57247	57248	57248	Leo	28	“ One more thing , ”
57260	57263	57252	57252	Harry	43	“ Yes ? ”
57264	57299	57226	57226	Harry	43	“ Pack your bags . You are no longer in my employ — not only because of what you did all those years ago , but because of how you treated Ms. Forkes today . ”
57300	57306	57307	57307	Harry	43	“ Understood , Your Highness . ”
57310	57318	57307	57307	Harry	43	“ But I stand by my choices . ”
57336	57355	57325	57325	Leo	28	“ What were you thinking , Dad ? How could you do that to her ? To me ? ”
57494	57515	57516	57516	He	43	“ Your car is waiting for you . I thought you could read these on the ride to the airport . ”
57544	57547	57554	57554	he	43	“ Shit . ”
57582	57589	57579	57579	he	50	“ To the airport . Immediately . ”
57590	57595	57596	57597	the driver	707	“ Yes , sir , ”
57810	57814	57802	57803	Commander Jonathon	50	“ Where to ? ”
57815	57830	57831	57831	Jonathon	50	“ Do you happen to know what airline Ms. Forkes is flying out on ? ”
57835	57849	57850	57850	Leo	28	“ Randovia Airlines , Highness . Flight 363 , departing at five o’clock . ”
57888	57898	57931	57931	Jonathon	50	“ I need to get to that plane immediately . ”
57899	57930	57931	57931	Jonathon	50	“ She ’s at Gate F36 . That ’s on the other side of that airport . There ’s no way we can make it in time at this pace , ”
57934	57948	57931	57931	Jonathon	50	“ We could detain the plane , or have her pulled off it . ”
57949	57952	57953	57953	He	28	“ No . ”
57972	57988	57964	57967	the people around him	476	“ I ca n’t do that to her again . I have to … to … ”
58131	58138	58127	58127	Leo	28	“ Shall I detain the plane ? ”
58139	58142	58143	58143	He	28	“ No . ”
58176	58182	58185	58185	he	28	“ I have to run . ”
58294	58302	58287	58287	he	28	“ There ’s nothing worth saving here . ”
58578	58584	58585	58587	The flight attendant	1017	“ Excuse me , sir . ”
58590	58602	58585	58587	The flight attendant	1017	“ Please be seated . We ’re about to take off . ”
58603	58613	58614	58614	She	27	“ I have to get off this plane immediately . ”
58630	58639	58640	58640	she	27	“ You ca n’t get off the plane , ”
58654	58678	58640	58640	she	27	“ Once the doors are closed , you can’t — wait . Are n’t you that woman the prince detained the other day ? ”
58687	58694	58695	58695	She	27	“ Yes , and I escaped . ”
58704	58729	58695	58695	She	27	“ If he finds out you helped me leave the country , you might be charged with aiding and abetting . Arrest me immediately . ”
58730	58736	58737	58738	A man	340	“ If you ’re escaping … ”
58744	58761	58737	58738	A man	340	“ Why are you turning yourself in when you ’re about to get away with it ? ”
58762	58771	58783	58783	he	340	“ Guilt . Tons and tons of guilt . ”
58821	58833	58813	58813	She	27	“ Detain me instantly , or you ’ll answer to him . ”
58884	58890	58891	58892	the man	147	“ I do n’t know … ”
58895	58902	58903	58903	she	27	“ Let me off the plane , ”
58910	58938	58903	58903	she	27	“ Call the palace , and ask to speak with the prince . He ’ll back up the story about my escape after he hears my voice . ”
58958	58968	58969	58969	he	147	“ I ’ll take care of this , ma’am , ”
58976	58980	58969	58969	he	147	“ Thank you , ”
58988	58997	58981	58981	Alicia	27	“ Go on . Get it over with . ”
59011	59026	59008	59008	his	147	“ So you escape , get on the plane , and then have remorse ? ”
59027	59031	59032	59032	she	27	“ Pretty much , ”
59061	59068	59069	59069	She	27	“ You ca n’t just come — ”
59074	59079	59069	59069	She	27	“ Oh my God . ”
59178	59181	59182	59182	she	27	“ Leo ? ”
59192	59196	59185	59187	The flight attendant	1017	“ Your Highness ? ”
59326	59330	59331	59331	He	1049	“ Your Highness . ”
59346	59365	59343	59343	he	1049	“ She ’s here . Just so you know , she turned herself in of her own accor — ”
59366	59372	59373	59373	Leo	28	“ Please release her immediately . ”
59383	59400	59373	59373	Leo	28	“ She ’s not my prisoner , and she ’s free to go wherever she pleases . ”
59433	59441	59442	59442	He	28	“ I ’m so sorry , Alicia . ”
59459	59484	59442	59442	He	28	“ I ’m sorry for everything I said , everything I did n’t say , and everything I ’m about to say right now . ”
59485	59488	59489	59489	She	27	“ I — ”
59568	59587	59557	59557	she	27	“ There ’s a crowd here . Let ’s go somewhere quiet and private , and we can — ”
59588	59630	59631	59631	He	28	“ No . I ’m not hiding you from the world anymore . I ran all the way to this plane , and I did n’t give a damn who saw it , or me , and I still do n’t . ”
59637	59643	59631	59631	He	28	“ Please remove her restraints . ”
59663	59676	59657	59657	he	28	“ Do you need any assistance in getting her off the plane ? ”
59677	59693	59694	59694	Leo	28	“ No , thank you . I wo n’t be forcing her off the plane , ”
59720	59733	59710	59715	The woman in the aisle seat	1056	“ Do you mind if I delay your flight for a bit ? ”
59746	59750	59751	59751	he	28	“ Thank you , ”
59757	59762	59751	59751	he	28	“ I appreciate that . ”
59774	59790	59763	59763	Alicia	27	“ We can just get off the plane , and you can tell me whatever — ”
59791	59819	59820	59820	he	28	“ I ’m going to say this one more time , and for the love of God , please believe me . I never got your letters , ”
59823	59833	59820	59820	he	28	“ I swear it . I did n’t mean — ”
59834	59838	59839	59839	She	27	“ I know . ”
59866	59871	59855	59855	She	27	“ I believe you . ”
59872	59876	59879	59879	himself	28	“ And I — ”
59886	59892	59893	59893	he	28	“ Wait . You do ? ”
59899	59904	59893	59893	he	28	“ You believe me ? ”
59905	59909	59910	59910	she	27	“ I do , ”
59929	59942	59943	59943	She	27	“ But you do n’t know yet why I never got them . ”
59953	59958	59943	59943	She	27	“ And you do ? ”
59959	59983	59984	59984	he	28	“ I found out today that my father took them . Hid them . And Harry was the one who wrote to you , ”
60001	60053	59984	59984	he	28	“ I ’ll explain more , if you want , but I think those details are best left for a more private moment . Perhaps email , or over the phone once you ’re back home . But … I wanted to tell you the truth before you left for good . ”
60179	60185	60186	60186	She	1060	“ Thank you for that . ”
60206	60239	60186	60186	She	1060	“ It ’s nice to know what happened . Closure and all that . I did n’t know he disliked me so much as to go to all that trouble , though . ”
60240	60296	60297	60297	he	28	“ He did n’t dislike you . I think he just felt I was too young to be in love with someone as deeply as I was . Afterward , he felt bad , though . Not that this makes up for what he did , but he ’s the one who paid your tuition , ”
60327	60338	60297	60297	he	28	“ And he requested Baker send you here , too . ”
60428	60437	60407	60408	her boss	359	“ So he brought me here … why ? ”
60438	60457	60468	60468	he	359	“ To make it up to you , and to bring us back into the same country together . ”
60495	60500	60468	60468	he	359	“ I ’m guessing . ”
60501	60504	60505	60505	She	1060	“ Wow . ”
60519	60531	60505	60505	She	1060	“ I do n’t really know what to say to that . ”
60532	60549	60550	60550	He	359	“ I ’m even suspecting he had a part in us seeing one another that night . ”
60572	60609	60610	60610	He	359	“ Now that you mention it … I got a flyer slipped under my door , with a ticket for free entry and some free drinks . I thought it was just a complimentary hotel thing . ”
60680	60690	60691	60691	He	359	“ Well , then , that confirms my suspicions . ”
60756	60793	60794	60794	She	1060	“ He brought us back together , the best way he could , because he regretted his actions . It does n’t excuse him , or make it okay , but I wanted you to know . ”
60826	60904	60905	60905	He	1075	“ Thank you for letting me know . I ’m sorry I did n’t believe you . It’s … it ’s been a rough few years , and I ’m not saying it makes my actions okay , or anything , either . But … it ’s hard for me to trust . To leap in with both feet . I ’m not that girl who introduces herself to the cute boy at the skating rink anymore . ”
60913	60923	60924	60924	He	1075	“ And I ’m not that boy , either . ”
60946	60975	60935	60935	he	1075	“ We met before , you see . In America . We were what you Americans call High School Sweethearts … is that the right term , Alicia ? ”
60986	60992	60976	60976	Alicia	27	“ Kind of , yes . ”
60993	61001	61002	61002	he	1075	“ I loved her , you see , ”
61016	61051	61052	61052	He	1075	“ I loved her with all my heart . The type of love that you only read about in books . That was ten years ago , and I thought of her every day . ”
61073	61105	61068	61068	he	1075	“ I thought of you every day , Alicia , and I just thought I ’d let you know , before you go , that I loved you so very much . ”
61252	61260	61261	61261	She	27	“ I thought of you , too . ”
61283	61287	61269	61269	her	27	“ Every day . ”
61303	61310	61295	61295	he	1075	“ You ’re crying . Why ? ”
61311	61317	61318	61318	she	27	“ I do n’t know , ”
61328	61345	61318	61318	she	27	“ It ’s just sad , I guess . All of this is just … sad . ”
61346	61354	61355	61355	he	1075	“ That we thought of each other ? ”
61400	61403	61432	61432	he	1075	“ Yes . ”
61404	61407	61408	61408	He	1075	“ Yeah … ”
61411	61421	61408	61408	He	1075	“ You ’re free to go , you know . ”
61451	61455	61439	61444	The woman in the aisle seat	1056	“ I know . ”
61456	61469	61439	61444	The woman in the aisle seat	1056	“ I wo n’t try to stop you or change your mind . ”
61480	61500	61476	61476	she	27	“ It ’s probably best if you did n’t . We both know how this ends , after all . ”
61521	61535	61476	61476	she	27	“ And how ’s that , if you do n’t mind my asking ? ”
61536	61543	61544	61544	She	27	“ With you marrying a princess . ”
61553	61574	61544	61544	She	27	“ One with lots of land and money . And with me going back to New York to my cat . ”
61575	61581	61476	61476	she	27	“ You have a cat ? ”
61582	61585	61586	61586	She	27	“ Yeah . ”
61595	61600	61586	61586	She	27	“ And a fish . ”
61606	61615	61601	61601	He	1092	“ You had a fish , you mean ? ”
61616	61620	61621	61621	She	27	“ Wh — ? ”
61627	61634	61621	61621	She	27	“ Scotty would never eat Wallace . ”
61635	61644	61601	61601	He	1092	“ He sounds very well behaved , then . ”
61645	61648	61621	61621	She	27	“ Extremely , ”
61659	61669	61670	61670	She	27	“ And you want to go back to them ? ”
61673	61676	61670	61670	She	27	“ Well … ”
61677	61685	61686	61686	he	1092	“ To work on your bucket list ? ”
61689	61707	61708	61708	He	1092	“ I crossed off quite a bit already . I think I ’ll give it a rest . ”
61720	61839	61717	61717	his	1092	“ I ’m breaking all of my rules in doing this , in making a scene that will more than likely be all over every single social media site , if it is n’t already , but I do n’t care . I ’m going to say it anyway . I ’m going to miss you , Alicia . So much . Every day . You ’ll always be the girl I fell in love with on that skating rink all those years ago , and I ’ll never forget that . I loved you then , and I love you now . I will always love you , Alicia , no matter how far away you are . ”
62009	62018	62019	62019	she	1093	“ I ’ll never forget you , either , ”
62023	62030	62019	62019	she	1093	“ I love you , too . ”
62309	62316	62299	62299	his	1094	“ Say it again , Alicia . ”
62317	62322	62323	62323	she	1093	“ I love you , ”
62326	62329	62323	62323	she	1093	“ But — ”
62528	62536	62537	62537	She	1093	“ No buts . You love me . ”
62542	62547	62539	62539	her	1093	“ Yes … but — ”
62548	62554	62555	62555	He	1094	“ And I love you . ”
62569	62622	62559	62560	the crowd	128	“ I ’ve always loved you , and my father was right to bring you here . He wanted me to fall in love , and get married , and I would never do that with you out there somewhere , maybe thinking about me as much as I thought about you . ”
62623	62630	62631	62631	She	1112	“ I was . I am . ”
62638	62644	62645	62645	She	1112	“ But you ’re a … ”
62658	62664	62645	62645	She	1112	“ … uh … prince . ”
62670	62679	62645	62645	She	1112	“ And that ’s a problem for you ? ”
62680	62685	62686	62686	She	1112	“ Well … yeah . ”
62748	62758	62759	62759	He	1094	“ I might have done research on your customs … ”
62771	62775	62759	62759	He	1094	“ What customs ? ”
62776	62780	62781	62781	Her	1112	“ You know . ”
62790	62830	62786	62786	her	1112	“ Marriage customs , and stuff . I looked it up , and you have to marry a princess , which is fine . I mean , it ’s expected , considering … you know . Who you are . ”
62837	62851	62831	62831	Her	1112	“ God , I ca n’t believe I just admitted I Googled that . ”
62963	62983	62951	62951	he	1094	“ By the way , that law has been changed . My father saw to it six months ago . ”
62988	62993	62951	62951	he	1094	“ Wait . What ? ”
62994	62999	62951	62951	he	1094	“ You heard me . ”
63014	63035	63003	63003	he	1094	“ I swore I would n’t do this . That I would n’t ask you to stay . But I — ”
63104	63154	63155	63155	She	1120	“ Do n’t go . I love you , and I ’ll always love you , and we were just kids when we met , and when we made those promises , but I stand by every word I said back then , as the man I am today . ”
63225	63262	63263	63263	He	1121	“ More importantly , I stand by what I said yesterday , too . Even if you stay on this flight and go home , I ’ll always be here , waiting for that phone call . ”
63282	63379	63263	63263	He	1121	“ A year . Five . Ten . A million . Does n’t matter how much time passes . I ’ll be single , and waiting for you to change your mind , waiting for my phone to ring because you ’re here and you need me to pick you up at the airport . Because a love like we have ? One that survives ten years of lies , separation , and pain ? That does n’t die . It never will . I ’ll be here . Waiting for you . I swear that . ”
63405	63428	63388	63388	she	1120	“ God , that was good . Like , really , really good . How long have you been planning that speech ? ”
63429	63438	63439	63439	He	1121	“ Ten long , lonely , horrible years . ”
63452	63471	63439	63439	He	1121	“ And I ’ll do it all over again , if that ’s what you want from me . ”
63488	63505	63482	63482	her	1120	“ I do n’t want that . I want you . This . Us . But — ”
63506	63538	63539	63539	He	1121	“ If you do n’t want to stay , that ’s okay . You can go home , and we ’ll make it work . Facetime . Phone calls . Texts . ”
63580	63587	63573	63573	He	1121	“ We can make it work . ”
63588	63597	63598	63598	She	1120	“ You ’re right . We totally could . ”
63642	63645	63646	63646	He	1121	“ But — ”
63649	63655	63646	63646	He	1121	“ Please . No buts . ”
63656	63659	63660	63660	She	1120	“ But — ”
63665	63673	63660	63660	She	1120	“ I mean … Take me home . ”
63679	63682	63674	63674	He	1121	“ Home ? ”
63683	63690	63696	63696	she	1120	“ Yeah . To the castle . ”
63715	63718	63696	63696	she	1120	“ Home . ”
63747	63757	63758	63758	he	1121	“ I ca n’t wait to get you home , ”
63764	63767	63768	63768	she	1120	“ Good , ”
63778	63799	63768	63768	she	1120	“ Now let ’s go so I can show you , in privacy , just how much I love you . ”
63800	63805	63806	63806	He	1121	“ As you wish . ”
63813	63822	63806	63806	He	1121	“ Anything you wish , forever and always . ”
64297	64301	64302	64302	she	27	“ Come in , ”
64383	64417	64361	64361	his	28	“ You look utterly , breathtakingly , unbelievably beautiful tonight . I am , hands down , the luckiest man on this planet , because I get to have you on my arm . ”
64426	64456	64423	64423	she	27	“ And you , sir , are as smooth a talker as ever . But you already have my heart , so you can stop with your flowery words . ”
64457	64460	64461	64461	he	28	“ Never , ”
64474	64518	64461	64461	he	28	“ The day I stop saying how lucky I am , is the day I start taking you for granted , and it ’ll be the day I start to lose you , so it ’ll never happen . Not on my watch . ”
64549	64556	64537	64537	He	28	“ I love you so much . ”
64557	64564	64565	64565	He	28	“ I love you , too . ”
64596	64607	64590	64590	he	28	“ There ’s something missing from your wardrobe , though . ”
64696	64706	64694	64694	Brian	34	“ What ’s missing ? ’ she asked nervously . “
64711	64722	64723	64723	Diamonds	86	” He rubbed his chin , staring at her thoughtfully . “
64725	64729	64723	64723	Diamonds	86	” She stiffened . “
64741	64753	64732	64732	I	0	” She moved over to the mirror , studying herself critically . “
64787	64788	64782	64785	a small property holder	1153	” “
64796	64807	64782	64785	a small property holder	1153	” he said , his voice gravelly from behind her . “
64822	64823	64824	64824	I	0	” “
64826	64912	64824	64824	I	0	” As she turned , the words she ’d been about to say died in her throat . Because there , kneeling behind her on one knee , was Leo . He held a ring in his hand that had more diamonds on it than she had dollars in her bank account . It was white gold , or platinum , and it had a princess cut diamond smack dab in the middle of all the other ones . A huge , several carat diamond . “
64917	64929	64824	64824	I	0	” He gave her a huge , beautiful , brilliant smile . “
65020	65031	65032	65032	I	0	” She covered her mouth , tears filling her eyes . “
65034	65035	65032	65032	I	0	” “
65087	65094	65095	65095	You	27	” He held the ring up , “
65187	65198	65184	65185	My wife	1166	” She pressed her fingers against her lips , speechless . “
65225	65240	65241	65242	Alicia Forkes	27	” He locked eyes with her , took a deep breath , and asked , “
65255	65290	65245	65245	you	27	” Nodding , she gulped in a huge breath , but it turned into more of a sob than anything , as she fell to her knees and framed his face with unsteady hands . “
65301	65399	65400	65400	I	0	” Laughing , he dropped the ring between them and pulled her into his arms , kissing her until she forgot all about the party out there , and the people , and everything else that was making her nervous . Because all that mattered was she ’d have Leo by her side , holding her tight , and when the party was over … She ’d fall asleep in his arms . And that was all she needed . Him . He broke off the kiss , laughing again , picked up the ring and said , “
65413	65436	65410	65410	your	1169	” With blurry eyes , she watched him slide it onto her ring finger . It , of course , fit perfectly . “
65441	65442	65410	65410	your	1169	” “
65476	65517	65518	65520	My future queen	1172	” He tightened his grip on her fingers and lifted his face to hers . The happiness , tinged with a bit of possessiveness , she saw in those dark blue depths stole her breath right out of her lungs . “
65522	65527	65518	65520	My future queen	1172	” he said reverently . “
65531	65569	65518	65520	My future queen	1172	” she whispered , pressing her hand to his cheek . He kissed her gently . Smiling at her , he stood and offered her his hand , his light dusting of freckles playing on his cheeks . “
65580	65659	65571	65571	you	0	” With him by her side ? She was ready for anything . She slipped her hand into his and let him lead her out into the hallway , down the stairs , and to the doors of the ballroom . As the butler — James — swung open the opulent maple doors , and she glanced at Leo and his staid , serious expression as he stood ramrod straight , she rose up on tiptoes and whispered , “
65671	65708	65571	65571	you	0	” He shot her an incredulous look , opened his mouth , closed it … And laughed . Everyone turned , watching them with a smile , and he leaned down , his eyes sparkling mischievously . “
65720	65720	65571	65571	you	0	”
