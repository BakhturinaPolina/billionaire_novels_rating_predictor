921	929	972	972	Millie	83	“ It ’s not funny , Mills . ”
966	971	972	972	Millie	83	“ You know what ? ”
975	991	972	972	Millie	83	“ I have a notification that Cloverleigh Farms has a new Dearly Beloved review too . ”
996	1024	993	993	she	83	“ Looks like she was busy this morning . Why is she online posting bullshit reviews ? Should n’t she be packing for her honeymoon or something ? ”
1025	1031	972	972	Millie	83	“ What does yours say ? ”
1032	1124	1125	1125	My	0	“ It says , ‘ The peonies were wilted , the cheese toasts were soggy , the staff was rude , and the vodka was watered down . Everything was cheap cheap cheap even though I paid top dollar . I do n’t know how this place has so many great reviews , they ruined my wedding . My ceremony was n’t even in the place they ’d promised me it would be . I want a refund . ’ That last sentence is in all caps , by the way . ”

1165	1193	1125	1125	My	0	“ But people on this app do n’t know that , Millie . They just see a one - star review and assume I serve bad food ! ”

1232	1239	1149	1149	Millie	83	“ Easy for you to say . ”
1266	1310	1257	1257	I	0	“ Cloverleigh Farms has been around forever , and its reputation is established . It has a bajillion great reviews on Dearly Beloved already , but The Veggie Vixen is brand new — and now my only review says yucky and just ew ! ”
1311	1362	1125	1125	My	0	“ If it bothers you that much , then respond to it . Apologize for her negative experience , say you always want your customers to be happy , and suggest she contact you directly . And if she really wants her money back , just give it to her . ”

1772	1835	1755	1755	I	0	“ Reviews are what bring in new business . I ’ve been working my ass off to gain traction , and this just set me back at the starting line — no , it ’s worse than that ! At least when I started out , I was on neutral ground . Now I ’m on soggy ground . I ’m sinking ! ”
1836	1849	1954	1954	Millie	83	“ You ’re fine . Do you need me to come over ? ”

2831	2834	2835	2835	I	0	“ Worse , ”
2838	2848	2835	2835	I	0	“ But better than the night before the SATs . ”

2979	2984	2957	2957	her	83	“ Got any advice ? ”
2985	3010	2859	2859	her	83	“ Wear a fabulous short dress with a great pair of heels . Show off your legs . That will distract from your hair . ”
3011	3041	3042	3042	She	83	“ I do n’t own fabulous dresses . I ’ve spent almost every night for the last five years in a kitchen . Can I borrow something from you ? ”
3045	3057	3042	3042	She	83	“ Felicity , my dresses are not going to fit you . ”
3058	3065	2859	2859	her	83	“ I could stuff my bra . ”
3066	3078	3079	3079	she	83	“ You ’d have to stuff a lot more than that , ”
3114	3129	3106	3106	hers	83	“ I wish I had a date tonight . That would make it easier . ”

3163	3171	3156	3156	I	0	“ That ’s worse than going alone . ”
3172	3177	3178	3178	My	0	“ What about Hutton ? ”
3187	3207	3178	3178	My	0	“ He said absolutely not the first time I asked . But I guess I could ask him again . ”

3773	3782	3783	3783	Millie	83	“ I ’d call him up right now , ”
3786	3792	3783	3783	Millie	83	“ He hates the phone . ”
3793	3796	3783	3783	Millie	83	“ Why ? ”
3797	3812	3813	3813	Millie	83	“ Because it involves talking to people . He likes numbers more than words . ”
3816	3856	3813	3813	Millie	83	“ Guess that ’s why he ’s a billionaire and we ’re us . Somebody asked me the other day what he does — everyone is talking about him — and I did n’t even know what to say . ”
3857	3884	3885	3885	I	0	“ My answer is always , ‘ He co - founded a cryptocurrency exchange called HFX . ’ But do n’t ask me to explain it . ”
3890	3905	3885	3885	I	0	“ Whenever he tries to tell me what it is , I get lost . ”
3906	3945	3946	3946	I	0	“ How can that be ? You ’re a math whiz too , Miss I Skipped First Grade . We all know you were doing complex algebraic equations when the rest of us were learning B says buh . ”
3955	3978	3946	3946	I	0	“ The kind of math Hutton does is way beyond algebra . You do n’t get to be a billionaire solving for x. ”
3979	4003	4004	4004	Millie	83	“ Speaking of which , you ’d think a billionaire would want to spend his summer vacation somewhere more ritzy than northern Michigan , ”
4007	4044	4045	4045	I	0	“ Well , his family is here , and Hutton ’s not really the ritzy type — although I assure you , the place he ’s staying in is not your typical cabin in the woods , ”
4051	4091	4045	4045	I	0	“ It ’s got like four bedrooms , three decks , a gourmet kitchen , one of those indoor / outdoor fireplaces , cathedral ceilings , huge windows . When you look out , all you see are trees . ”
4092	4095	4096	4096	Her	83	“ Nice . ”
4101	4110	4096	4096	Her	83	“ Sounds like you ’re there a lot . ”
4111	4121	4122	4122	I	0	“ We hang out a few times a week , ”
4221	4230	4231	4231	she	323	“ A few times a week , huh ? ”
4234	4240	4231	4231	she	323	“ That sounds like dating . ”
4241	4249	4250	4250	I	0	“ No dating , we just hang . ”
4263	4308	4250	4250	I	0	“ He does n’t love going out in public , which was the case even before he was a celebrity , but now it ’s even worse . People just stare with no shame . Women flirt outrageously . Guys ask for stock tips . ”
4309	4312	4231	4231	she	323	“ Really ? ”
4313	4316	4317	4317	I	0	“ Yes . ”
4326	4386	4387	4387	Millie	83	“ He runs in the park super early to avoid having to deal with people , but there ’s this group of old ladies who gather in the park to do their Prancercise , who call themselves the Prancin ’ Grannies , and they adore him . They prance right up to tell him all about their single granddaughters . ”
4390	4394	4387	4387	Millie	83	“ Stop it . ”
4395	4403	4387	4387	Millie	83	“ His own mom is even worse . ”
4404	4423	4387	4387	Millie	83	“ Does she still have the shop downtown ? The one that sells all the crystals and candles ? ”
4424	4445	4446	4446	I	0	“ Yep . Mystic on Main . She ’s constantly trying to set him up on dates with her customers . ”
4487	4547	4548	4548	Millie	83	“ Like she ’ll call him and say she has a computer problem at the shop , or she ca n’t reach something on a high shelf , and when he shows up to help , there is n’t really a problem , but there ’s a woman she wants to introduce him to . He gets so mad . ”
4551	4559	4548	4548	Millie	83	“ Does he ever talk about Zlatka ? ”
4609	4612	4590	4590	They	329	“ No . ”
4613	4626	4627	4627	My	0	“ I wonder if it ’s true what she said about him . ”
4631	4643	4644	4644	Millie	83	“ I have no idea , and I ’m not asking . ”
4647	4681	4644	4644	Millie	83	“ No , I guess there ’s no way you can be like , ‘ Hey , I heard you like to tie women up and boss them around in the bedroom . ’ ”
4682	4689	4590	4590	They	329	“ People just like to talk . ”
4690	4696	4697	4697	Millie	83	“ Especially about that stuff , ”
4700	4740	4697	4697	Millie	83	“ Although if you see any whips , chains , or blindfolds in his closet , let me know . It seems so opposite his quiet personality , but you never know what people are like behind closed doors . ”
4756	4768	4741	4741	I	0	“ Anyway , what am I going to do about tonight ? ”
4769	4780	4590	4590	They	329	“ Why go at all ? Just do n’t show . ”
4781	4825	4697	4697	Millie	83	“ Because I ’m catering some appetizers , which I had to beg to do , because the reunion chairwoman wanted to go with one caterer , and she did n’t want everything vegetarian . But I thought it would be good publicity . ”
4826	4835	4741	4741	I	0	“ Maybe you can just drop them off . ”
4836	4848	4849	4849	My	0	“ I do n’t want to be that person , Millie . ”
4857	4894	4853	4853	I	0	“ I do n’t want to be intimidated by people . I want to prove to myself that I can hold my head up in front of Mimi Pepper - Peabody , even with terrible bangs . ”
4895	4900	4901	4901	Millie	83	“ Okay , okay . ”
4908	4918	4901	4901	Millie	83	“ Who the heck is Mimi Pepper - Peabody ? ”
4919	4943	4853	4853	I	0	“ She ’s the reunion chair , a girl I went to school with . Beautiful , popular , you know the type . ”
4944	4949	4950	4950	I	0	“ A mean girl ? ”
4953	5043	4950	4950	I	0	“ That ’s tricky . It ’s not like she was outwardly mean to my face , but she had a way of cutting you down without looking like she was doing it . If I got a bloody nose in class , instead of privately asking me if I needed a tissue , she ’d yell out , ‘ Ew ! Felicity ’s nose is gushing buckets of blood , and it ’s so gross ! ’ And everyone would either laugh or say how disgusting it was . ”
5044	5052	4853	4853	I	0	“ Um , that ’s outwardly mean . ”
5053	5061	5062	5062	I	0	“ Yeah , I guess it is . ”
5074	5088	5062	5062	I	0	“ But she was so popular , she could get away with anything . ”
5089	5104	5105	5105	I	0	“ Well , tonight ’s your chance to tell her to go fuck herself . ”
5108	5115	5105	5105	I	0	“ That ’s not my style . ”
5116	5178	5062	5062	I	0	“ Fine . So go show her that being popular in high school does n’t mean shit once high school is over . And you never know , maybe she lost her looks . Maybe karma caught up with her and all her hair fell out from bleaching it too much . Maybe she has ten big warts on her nose . ”
5179	5198	5199	5199	I	0	“ Nope . I see her around town and she looks the same as she did back then . ”
5211	5216	5199	5199	I	0	“ And so do I. ”
5217	5236	5199	5199	I	0	“ Still . She ca n’t make you feel bad about yourself if you do n’t let her . ”
5237	5244	5245	5245	I	0	“ I wo n’t let her , ”
5946	5954	5942	5942	I	0	“ You know I hate the phone . ”
5955	5959	5961	5961	Felicity	151	“ I do , ”
5963	5986	5961	5961	Felicity	151	“ and I ’m sorry . But I did n’t think I could convey the urgency of this matter in a text . ”
6003	6013	5987	5987	I	0	“ Are you okay ? Is your nose bleeding ? ”
6014	6022	5961	5961	Felicity	151	“ No , it ’s not that . ”
6023	6036	6037	6037	I	0	“ Good . The memory of that last one still haunts me . ”
6525	6528	6520	6520	them	374	“ surprisingly great ”
6720	6731	6732	6732	she	382	“ Yeah , that was a bad one , sorry , ”
6735	6766	6732	6732	she	382	“ Hope they got the stains out of the tablecloth . But this does n’t involve blood , I promise . It does n’t even involve talking on the phone ! ”
6780	6786	6767	6767	I	0	“ What does it involve ? ”
6787	6793	6732	6732	she	382	“ Doing me a favor . ”
6794	6799	6874	6874	her	382	“ I ’m listening . ”
6800	6826	6767	6767	I	0	“ Okay , but before I tell you what it is , you have to promise to at least consider what I have to say . ”
6827	6839	6840	6840	I	0	“ You ’re not really nailing this sales pitch , MacAllister . ”
6863	6871	6872	6872	She	382	“ Sorry , let me try again . ”
6877	6886	6874	6874	her	382	“ Hey , Hutton ! How are you ? ”
6890	6900	6887	6887	I	0	“ Okay , considering I ’m on the phone . ”
6901	6911	6874	6874	her	382	“ Did you run in the park this morning ? ”
6912	6915	6874	6874	her	382	“ Yes . ”
6916	6926	6874	6874	her	382	“ Were the Prancin ’ Grannies out and about ? ”
6927	6949	6950	6950	Felicity	151	“ In full force . They just got matching T - shirts , which they were very excited to show me . ”
6953	6960	6950	6950	Felicity	151	“ Oh yeah ? What color ? ”
6961	6984	6874	6874	her	382	“ I ’d call it Pepto Bismol Pink . And they ’re bedazzled — which is a new word I learned today . ”
6985	7011	6950	6950	Felicity	151	“ I ’m sure that addition to your vocabulary will come in handy in your line of work . So what are you up to ? ”
7012	7038	6874	6874	her	382	“ I ’m going over to my sister ’s house to watch the kids so she can get a haircut . Neil is working today . ”
7101	7107	7108	7108	Felicity	151	“ That sounds like fun . ”
7111	7121	7108	7108	Felicity	151	“ What about tonight ? Do you have plans ? ”
7122	7125	7126	7126	I	0	“ Why ? ”
7140	7162	7163	7163	she	397	“ Because I ’m going somewhere really fun , and I was thinking maybe you ’d like to go with me ! ”
7169	7181	7163	7163	she	397	“ You ’re not talking about the reunion , are you ? ”
7182	7192	7193	7193	she	397	“ There will be food and drinks and music , ”
7203	7215	7193	7193	she	397	“ lots of people we have n’t seen in ten years — ”
7216	7236	7163	7163	she	397	“ I ’d gladly go another ten without seeing ninety - nine - point - nine percent of them . ”
7237	7246	7163	7163	she	397	“ — and I ’m making zucchini fritters ! ”
7247	7270	7193	7193	she	397	“ Felicity , you already asked me if I ’d go to this thing , and I said sorry , but no . ”
7271	7278	7163	7163	she	397	“ Do n’t you like zucchini ? ”
7279	7327	7328	7328	She	397	“ I like zucchini just fine . But I did n’t like high school that much , I do n’t like social events at all , and the thought of having to make small talk with any of those people makes me want to eat rat poison . ”
7331	7337	7328	7328	She	397	“ Yeah . I know . ”
7338	7347	7163	7163	she	397	“ Also , I have other plans tonight . ”
7348	7354	7163	7163	she	397	“ What are you doing ? ”
7355	7370	7163	7163	she	397	“ I promised my dad I ’d come to his barbershop quartet poker night . ”
7371	7376	7377	7377	she	397	“ That ’s social , ”
7380	7396	7397	7397	I	0	“ It ’s slightly social , and I do n’t really want to do it , ”
7407	7487	7397	7397	I	0	“ But there will only be four old guys there , and we ’ll be occupied with the card game . There will be snacks and beer , but no small talk . Minimal eye contact . No one asking for selfies . No prancing grannies . Possibly I ’ll have to endure some old - timey four - part harmonies , and I ’ll definitely be subjected to a lot of dad jokes , but I ’ll live . ”
7488	7503	7163	7163	she	397	“ I love that your dad is actually a barber in a barbershop quartet . ”
7504	7528	7529	7529	Felicity	151	“ The Clipper Cuts are available for wakes , weddings , and everything in between . They will meet all your entertainment needs . ”
7532	7560	7529	7529	Felicity	151	“ Well , while you ’re enjoying the snacks and harmonies , spare a thought for me trying to survive high school again , this time alone . ”
7561	7568	7163	7163	she	397	“ Just skip it , Felicity . ”
7574	7579	7580	7580	she	400	“ I ca n’t , ”
7583	7587	7580	7580	she	400	“ Why not ? ”
7588	7615	7616	7616	She	400	“ Because I ’m catering some appetizers and it will be a good business opportunity . Plus , I might have to do some damage control . ”
7636	7651	7616	7616	She	400	“ And it ’s all lies ! That bride raved about everything all night . ”
7652	7664	7665	7665	She	400	“ Want me to buy the app and shut it down ? ”
7668	7707	7665	7665	She	400	“ Oh my God , can you ? No , wait . Do n’t do that — it ’s a really helpful thing for a lot of people and businesses . Just not for me at the moment . ”
7708	7717	7718	7718	I	0	“ Your business is going to be fine , ”
7722	7742	7718	7718	I	0	“ But I know how it feels to have people talking shit about you , and I ’m sorry . ”
7845	7856	7857	7857	she	409	“ Does that mean you ’ll come with me tonight ? ”
7861	7886	7887	7887	She	409	“ No . But if there are any leftover zucchini fritters , bring them over tomorrow . You can tell me how it went . ”
7890	7915	7887	7887	She	409	“ Fine . But if I change my mind about the app , would you really buy it and shut it down for me ? ”
7916	7921	7945	7945	her	409	“ In a heartbeat . ”
7922	7932	7933	7933	We	410	“ Thank you . Have fun with your family . ”
8694	8698	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ What’cha doin’ ? ”
8699	8714	8715	8715	She	71	“ Deciding whether I want to come in . Are Mom and Dad here ? ”
8718	8735	8715	8715	She	71	“ They stopped by after their Saturday morning power walk . Matching track suits and all . ”
8736	8744	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ Any way I can avoid them ? ”
8745	8754	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ Why do you need to avoid them ? ”
8755	8802	8803	8803	She	71	“ They ’re just a lot . Mom ’s all over me about what she calls my emotional avoidance issues , trying to set me up on dates with her kooky clients right and left , and I ’m already hanging out with Dad later tonight . ”
8806	8810	8803	8803	She	71	“ Poker night ? ”
8811	8814	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ Yeah . ”
8815	8857	8858	8858	She	71	“ Lucky you . But you ca n’t leave . I need to be at the salon in twenty minutes , and Mom and Dad both have to work today . They just popped in to see the kids real quick . ”
8862	8868	8858	8858	She	71	“ They love popping in . ”
8869	8885	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ I told you not to buy a house right around the block from them . ”
8886	8893	8894	8894	She	71	“ I know , I know . ”
8900	8919	8894	8894	She	71	“ But it ’s a good location and the price was right . We ’re not all billionaires . ”
8920	8938	8939	8939	She	71	“ Fuck off , I told you I ’d help you with a house . You refused . ”
8943	8973	8974	8974	She	71	“ I did , and it gave me great pleasure . So thanks for that . Anyway , you covered my student loans , and that was a lot . ”
8979	8989	8974	8974	She	71	“ You get free therapy from me for life . ”
8990	9010	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ Just what a guy wants , his big sister bossing him around and calling it good for him . ”
9011	9062	8939	8939	She	71	“ Speaking of which , did you call the woman I told you about , Natalia Lopez ? The one who does the acceptance and commitment therapy ? She ’s always booked super far in advance but as a favor to me , she said she ’d get you in . ”
9063	9072	8974	8974	She	71	“ No . I do n’t call people . ”
9073	9099	8682	8682	Allie	71	“ Hutton ! You did n’t like cognitive behavioral therapy , and this is another option . A different approach . Why not try it ? ”
9100	9108	8939	8939	She	71	“ Because I do n’t need it . ”
9109	9139	8974	8974	She	71	“ So testifying in front of Congress wo n’t be a problem then ? How many times are they going to let you get away with pushing it back ? ”
9446	9449	9450	9450	he	246	“ Hutton ! ”
9457	9462	9450	9450	he	246	“ Still coming tonight ? ”
9463	9470	9440	9440	my	0	“ Do I have a choice ? ”
9471	9484	9485	9485	He	246	“ Nope , I already told the guys you ’ll be there . ”
9488	9509	9485	9485	He	246	“ They ’re excited to have a celebrity at the game , but a little worried about your deep pockets . ”
9510	9519	9520	9520	I	0	“ I ’m not a celebrity , Dad , ”
9532	9547	9549	9550	my sister	238	“ They should be worried about him counting cards , not placing high bets , ”
9560	9571	9549	9550	my sister	238	“ Hutton has never cheated a day in his life ! ”
9583	9606	9607	9608	My sister	238	“ And he knows that nothing good ever comes from taking a penny you did n’t earn . It brings bad luck . ”
9704	9718	9720	9720	Zosia	108	“ But what if you find a penny on the street , Grandma ? ”
9722	9729	9720	9720	Zosia	108	“ Is n’t that good luck ? ”
9730	9742	9743	9743	she	71	“ Depends if you find it tails or heads side up , ”
9747	9784	9743	9743	she	71	“ The ancient Romans believed if you saw a coin heads up , it was lucky , but if it was tails up , you should turn it over and leave it for the next person . ”
9789	9830	9743	9743	she	71	“ I ’ll keep that in mind in case I come across any ancient Roman coins . In the meantime , I ’m gon na predict that being a math genius gives Hutton the edge at the poker table tonight . ”
9831	9860	9861	9861	I	0	“ The only edge being a math genius might give someone at the poker table is knowing they should quit early and go home with all their money , ”
9870	9888	9861	9861	I	0	“ The reason casinos are so huge is because most people have no idea how probability works . ”
9889	9892	9901	9901	she	454	“ Hutton . ”
9916	9921	9901	9901	she	454	“ Are you okay ? ”
9922	9927	9901	9901	she	454	“ I ’m fine . ”
9928	9935	9901	9901	she	454	“ You do n’t look fine . ”
9936	9943	9901	9901	she	454	“ I ’m fine , Mom . ”
9944	9958	9959	9960	My dad	246	“ Look at him , Stan . Does he look fine to you ? ”
9963	9968	9959	9960	My dad	246	“ I suppose so . ”
9969	9985	9901	9901	she	454	“ You do n’t think he looks sort of pale and sad around the eyes ? ”
9986	9992	9993	9994	My father	453	“ Sad around the eyes ? ”
9999	10004	9993	9994	My father	453	“ Maybe a little . ”
10005	10019	10020	10020	Allie	71	“ I ’m getting a sense of loneliness and discontent within your aura . ”
10031	10035	10036	10036	I	0	“ Stop it , ”
10039	10045	10036	10036	I	0	“ My aura is fine . ”
10046	10058	10059	10060	My mom	465	“ You do n’t have to pretend with us , sweetheart . ”
10065	10071	10059	10060	My mom	465	“ We ’re your family . ”
10072	10078	10036	10036	I	0	“ I ’m not pre — ”
10079	10089	10090	10090	she	465	“ Money ca n’t buy happiness , you know , ”
10094	10124	10090	10090	she	465	“ True happiness comes from our connection to others and to our higher selves . It does n’t come from things like yachts or private jets or fancy cars . ”
10125	10137	10036	10036	I	0	“ I do n’t own any of those things , Mom . ”
10145	10167	10139	10139	she	465	“ It comes from allowing yourself to be loved and offering love in return . Is n’t that right , Stan ? ”
10168	10175	10176	10177	My dad	246	“ That ’s right , Barb . ”
10187	10204	10176	10177	My dad	246	“ And you do n’t need to be rich or famous or brilliant to find love . ”
10210	10226	10205	10205	Her	465	“ You just have to accept yourself as you are , and open your heart . ”
10227	10243	10245	10245	Allie	71	“ Actually , I think being rich , famous , and brilliant makes it harder , ”
10247	10269	10245	10245	Allie	71	“ You ’d get a lot of people wanting to be close to you , but maybe for the wrong reasons . ”
10270	10281	10282	10283	my mom	465	“ I ’m not saying it ’s easy to find , ”
10286	10304	10282	10283	my mom	465	“ I ’m just saying that we ’re all worthy . Do n’t you agree , Hutton ? ”
10305	10308	10309	10309	I	0	“ Yes , ”
10747	10753	10754	10754	I	0	“ Come on , guys , ”
10757	10777	10754	10754	I	0	“ Your faces are getting red , and your mom is going to get mad at me about it . ”
10902	10910	10893	10893	Allie	71	“ Wow . Look at you guys . ”
10911	10929	10930	10930	She	71	“ I said I ’d watch them . I did n’t say I ’d keep them clean . ”
10942	10950	10935	10935	she	71	“ Do you like the new cut ? ”
10956	10963	10951	10951	I	0	“ Looks the same to me . ”
10970	10999	10967	10967	her	71	“ Hey , someone in the chair next to me at the salon mentioned she was going to her ten - year reunion tonight . Is it yours ? ”
11000	11003	11067	11067	her	71	“ Probably . ”
11004	11010	10967	10967	her	71	“ You ’re not going ? ”
11011	11014	10967	10967	her	71	“ No . ”
11015	11019	11020	11020	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
11030	11036	11020	11020	I	0	“ I already have plans . ”
11037	11047	10967	10967	her	71	“ Poker night ? Those are your big plans ? ”
11048	11064	11065	11065	She	71	“ I did n’t say they were big . I just said they were plans . ”
11087	11092	11067	11067	her	71	“ Is Felicity going ? ”
11093	11098	11067	11067	her	71	“ I think so . ”
11116	11130	11113	11113	I	0	“ She asked me to go with her , but I said no . ”
11146	11170	11139	11139	she	238	“ Hutton ! How could you say no ? She was your best friend in high school . She was your prom date . ”
11171	11175	11176	11176	She	238	“ I remember . ”
11184	11197	11176	11176	She	238	“ And do you remember what you went through before asking her ? ”
11203	11235	11176	11176	She	238	“ Because I do . You agonized over it for weeks . It got so bad , you came to me for advice . I had to talk you into it . ”
11236	11253	11305	11305	she	238	“ Because it was scary . I did n’t know what she was going to say . ”
11254	11267	11176	11176	She	238	“ But she said yes , and you had a good time . ”
11514	11525	11526	11526	I	0	“ Look , it ’s nothing to do with Felicity , ”
11530	11538	11526	11526	I	0	“ I always have fun with her . ”
11539	11545	11546	11546	She	71	“ Of course you do . ”
11551	11602	11548	11548	her	71	“ We all know how you feel about Felicity , Hutton . It ’s been obvious for years . And despite your messy hair and your ugly mug and your terrible personality , she genuinely likes you too . I do n’t get why you two are n’t a thing . ”
11765	11772	11773	11773	I	0	“ I need a fairy godmother , ”
11807	11814	11801	11801	Luna	112	“ How about three of them ? ”
11815	11819	11782	11782	She	89	“ Even better . ”
11820	11834	11835	11835	she	89	“ Dex is out running errands , so we ’re having girl time , ”
11844	11849	11835	11835	she	89	“ Come on upstairs ! ”
11865	11871	11854	11854	I	0	“ How about this one ? ”
11893	11896	11900	11900	her	112	“ Yes , ”
11910	11919	11905	11905	she	112	“ It ’s definitely the best so far . ”
11920	11925	11905	11905	she	112	“ I like it . ”
11934	11941	11931	11931	her	112	“ Blue is my favorite color . ”
11942	11951	11952	11952	Winnie	89	“ It is a great shade for you . ”
11974	11984	11952	11952	Winnie	89	“ There . Now it fits a little better . ”
11985	11988	11989	11989	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
12080	12102	12107	12107	Winnie	89	“ I do like the color . You do n’t think the top is too . . . baggy on me ? ”
12103	12106	12107	12107	Winnie	89	“ Hmm . ”
12113	12123	12107	12107	Winnie	89	“ Do you have a push - up bra ? ”
12124	12133	12135	12135	Luna	112	“ What ’s a push - up bra ? ”
12137	12152	12154	12154	Hallie	112	“ It ’s a bra that pushes up your boobies and squeezes them together , ”
12156	12171	12154	12154	Hallie	112	“ So they sort of bulge out like water balloons . Mom wears them . ”
12175	12183	12172	12172	I	0	“ I might have something at home . ”
12184	12193	12194	12194	Winnie	89	“ Good . Okay , now the shoes . ”
12209	12239	12194	12194	Winnie	89	“ I think the nude strappy ones will be the best , but the platform sandals could also be cute . How much standing do you have to do ? ”
12240	12246	12247	12247	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
12267	12287	12247	12247	I	0	“ But I do n’t want to have trouble walking , and I ’m definitely not used to heels . ”
12288	12293	12294	12294	Winnie	89	“ I like those , ”
12313	12329	12330	12330	I	0	“ But it ’s not a very dressy look . How fancy is this event ? ”
12333	12340	12330	12330	I	0	“ The invitation said dressy casual . ”
12341	12348	12349	12349	Hallie	112	“ That ’s two different things , ”
12361	12378	12353	12353	I	0	“ Exactly . Why do fashionable people make things more difficult than they need to be ? ”
12379	12388	12389	12389	Winnie	89	“ I think this look works for casual , ”
12393	12409	12389	12389	Winnie	89	“ but if you want to go a little dressier , maybe try the heels . ”
12410	12419	12420	12420	I	0	“ I want to look elegant and sophisticated , ”
12427	12434	12423	12424	My sister	238	“ Then go for the heels . ”
12455	12458	12435	12435	I	0	“ Well ? ”
12459	12464	12465	12465	Winnie	89	“ They look perfect , ”
12468	12478	12465	12465	Winnie	89	“ But can you get around in them okay ? ”
12487	12492	12465	12465	Winnie	89	“ I ’ll manage . ”
12493	12496	12497	12497	She	89	“ Good . ”
12507	12519	12497	12497	She	89	“ Now what are we going to do about that hair ? ”
12525	12538	12497	12497	She	89	“ I do n’t know . I should n’t have cut it . ”
12539	12543	12545	12545	Winnie	89	“ I agree , ”
12547	12574	12545	12545	Winnie	89	“ but that ship has sailed , so let ’s figure out what we can do . Take it down and we ’ll look at it . ”
12580	12586	12575	12575	I	0	“ It ’s not pretty . ”
12587	12600	12545	12545	Winnie	89	“ I ’ve seen your self - serve haircuts before , sis . ”
12601	12610	12612	12612	I	0	“ This might be one of the worst . ”
12658	12668	12669	12669	Luna	112	“ Why did you do that to your hair ? ”
12672	12679	12680	12680	I	0	“ It ’s hard to explain , ”
12694	12731	12680	12680	I	0	“ Sometimes I just have this urge to cut it and I ca n’t stop myself . Like when I ’m upset about something . And I think cutting my hair will make me feel better . ”
12752	12765	12741	12741	I	0	“ But it does n’t . It only makes me feel worse . ”
12766	12772	12774	12774	Luna	112	“ I have an idea , ”
12776	12780	12774	12774	Luna	112	“ You do ? ”
12785	12789	12781	12781	She	112	“ Space buns . ”
12790	12794	12741	12741	I	0	“ Space buns ? ”
12795	12798	12799	12799	Hallie	112	“ Yes ! ”
12803	12824	12825	12825	Winnie	89	“ That ’s a great idea ! Space buns would n’t show how it ’s all crazy at the ends . ”
12828	12849	12825	12825	Winnie	89	“ You know what ? She might be right . Unless you have time to go get a professional trim . ”
12850	12855	12856	12856	I	0	“ I do n’t , ”
12859	12919	12856	12856	I	0	“ I barely had time to come here . I have to get my fritters and crostini in the Cloverleigh ovens before the restaurant there opens at five , pack everything in the warming bags , load the car , haul it over to the banquet hall by six , then have everything set out by quarter to seven . ”

18110	18136	18105	18105	She	454	“ Thank God . Because I have to get out of this closet soon , and I ca n’t face Mimi again without your help . ”
18137	18145	18206	18206	She	454	“ What closet ? Where are you ? ”
18146	18153	18154	18154	she	454	“ I ’m at the reunion , ”
18157	18183	18154	18154	she	454	“ but I ’m hiding in the coat closet because I did something bad . I mean , I said something I should n’t have . ”
18184	18188	18206	18206	She	454	“ About what ? ”
18189	18198	18206	18206	She	454	“ About you . Well , about us . ”

18285	18301	18206	18206	She	454	“ Thanks . But why did you lie about being engaged in the first place ? ”
18302	18311	18312	18312	she	454	“ I could n’t help it , Hutton , ”
18315	18418	18419	18419	she	604	“ Mimi ’s been so mean and terrible all night , first when it was just the two of us , and then in front of her friends , and I just could n’t let her get away with it anymore . She kept bragging about her own engagement to some rich dude who hates vegetables , and making me feel bad about myself , and then she was going to look me up on Dearly Beloved , and I had to say something to stop her before she saw that awful review . So I said I was engaged to you , ”
18427	18438	18419	18419	she	604	“ Also , there may have been some vodka involved . ”

18479	18494	18465	18465	her	604	“ No , I need you to come here and be my fake fiancé . ”
18499	18516	18465	18465	her	604	“ Is that really necessary ? Ca n’t you just say I ’m out of town ? ”
18517	18535	18536	18536	I	0	“ It ’s sort of too late for that . I already told her you were coming . ”
18549	18581	18536	18536	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , okay ? I ’ll straighten it all out eventually , but can you please , please come here tonight and pretend like we ’re getting married ? ”
18620	18648	18615	18615	I	0	“ It ’s quarter to eight . I wo n’t be there for at least forty - five minutes . I have to go home and change . ”

18664	18689	18690	18690	I	0	“ Something billionairy . A nice suit and tie . You do n’t happen to have a diamond ring lying around , do you ? ”
18693	18702	18690	18690	I	0	“ I ’m not that kind of billionaire . ”
18703	18713	18615	18615	I	0	“ Is there any chance you could find one ? ”
18714	18730	18615	18615	I	0	“ Where the hell would I find a diamond ring at eight o’clock at night ? ”
18731	18753	18615	18615	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Ca n’t you borrow jewels for the night like Richard Gere did in Pretty Woman ? ”
18754	18769	18770	18770	She	606	“ Richard Gere had more notice than I did . Jewelry stores are closed . ”
18773	18792	18770	18770	She	606	“ It ’s probably fine . I told Mimi the ring was at the jeweler ’s being sized . ”
18793	18810	18615	18615	I	0	“ Jesus Christ , Felicity . How am I going to keep all the lies straight ? ”
18817	18869	18615	18615	I	0	“ Those are the only ones I told so far ! We ’re engaged , the ring is at the jeweler ’s , and you ’re coming here later . I swear to God , I will make it up to you , Hutton — I just need this one night . ”
18870	18874	18875	18875	I	0	“ One hour , ”

18889	18927	18886	18886	she	606	“ I ’ll send you the venue address , and then you can text me when you get here . I ’ll even come out and meet you so you do n’t have to walk in alone . ”
18928	18931	18615	18615	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
18932	18951	18952	18952	I	0	“ Thank you , Hutton . I mean it . You ’re the best friend in the world . ”

18995	19004	18992	18992	she	606	“ Yeah , but I have to go . ”
19005	19008	19009	19009	I	0	“ Where ? ”
19014	19020	19009	19009	I	0	“ My high school reunion . ”
19021	19024	19025	19025	She	606	“ Really ? ”
19029	19047	19048	19048	I	0	“ Yeah . Felicity is there , and she needs me to . . . show up , ”
19062	19074	19075	19075	I	0	“ A date with Felicity ? I think that ’s wonderful ! ”
19083	19092	19075	19075	I	0	“ Can you apologize to Dad for me ? ”
19093	19116	19124	19124	her	606	“ Of course . Maybe I ’ll introduce Cleopatra to Harvey . He ’s been so lonely since Edna died last year . ”
19117	19121	19122	19122	She	606	“ Good idea . ”
19136	19161	19122	19122	She	606	“ You just go , darling . I ca n’t wait to hear all about it . But are you going to change first ? ”
19175	19185	19186	19186	She	606	“ And maybe fix your hair a little too ? ”
19202	19213	19196	19196	I	0	“ Stop it , Mom . I have to go . ”
19214	19220	19221	19221	She	606	“ Only trying to help . ”
19224	19251	19221	19221	She	606	“ Say hello to Felicity . I always had a feeling about the two of you . Past life soul mates if I ever saw them . ”
19252	19258	19196	19196	I	0	“ We ’re just friends . ”
19274	19318	19319	19319	I	0	“ Do n’t fight it , darling . Tomorrow we should do a tarot reading for you , feel out where this might be heading . And take an umbrella ! The leaves are upside down , and that always means a storm . ”
19590	19593	19594	19594	Felicity	151	“ Hutton ! ”
19615	19627	19601	19601	her	616	“ Thank you so much for coming ! You look amazing . ”

19849	19864	19865	19865	I	0	“ Are you saying you do n’t want to be engaged to me anymore ? ”
19868	19892	19865	19865	I	0	“ No . I ’m saying that I realize how ridiculous this whole thing is . And it ’s not fair to you . ”

20061	20071	20039	20039	I	0	“ That was n’t the plan , but yes . ”
20072	20081	20082	20082	I	0	“ It ’s okay . You look beautiful . ”
20100	20104	20089	20089	She	376	“ I do ? ”
20123	20156	20112	20112	I	0	“ Yes . But it ’s not that I do n’t think you look beautiful other times . I always think you ’re beautiful . I just meant that right now you — ”
20157	20160	20161	20161	She	376	“ Hey . ”
20175	20196	20161	20161	She	376	“ It ’s okay . It was a nice compliment . You ’ve just never said that to me before . ”

21109	21115	21117	21117	Felicity	151	“ We ’re very private , ”
21119	21126	21117	21117	Felicity	151	“ We did n’t announce it . ”

21215	21227	21228	21228	Felicity	151	“ That ’s another reason why we did n’t announce it , ”
21235	21250	21228	21228	Felicity	151	“ We did n’t want to hurt anyone ’s feelings . Right , sweetie ? ”
21277	21284	21286	21286	Mimi	92	“ Tell me about your ring , ”

21345	21357	21342	21342	Felicity	151	“ And the diamond is conflict - free . Ethically sourced . ”
21362	21365	21358	21358	Mimi	92	“ Cut ? ”
21366	21369	21342	21342	Felicity	151	“ Round . ”

21566	21604	21560	21560	her	92	“ But what does it matter , right ? The ring is n’t the most important thing . It ’s just a piece of metal and rock . The real worth is in the love you share . ”
21605	21611	21613	21613	Thornton	119	“ Tell that to her , ”
21625	21637	21613	21613	Thornton	119	“ I ’ll be right back . I need another drink . ”
21650	21661	21638	21638	Mimi	92	“ What about your dress ? Where ’s it from ? ”

21693	21710	21638	21638	Mimi	92	“ Cloverleigh Farms , of course . But it ’s very intimate — just immediate family . ”
21721	21732	21715	21715	Mimi	92	“ Sounds like you ’ve got it all worked out . ”
21733	21737	21738	21738	Felicity	151	“ We do . ”

21782	21794	21795	21795	Felicity	151	“ Well , it ’s actually still sort of a secret . ”
21799	21819	21795	21795	Felicity	151	“ We have n’t really announced anything official yet , so if you would n’t mind keeping it quiet ? ”
21820	21825	21769	21769	Mimi	92	“ Say no more . ”
21832	21847	21826	21826	Mimi	92	“ If you ’ll just excuse me , I ’m going to find Thornton . ”

21914	21937	21911	21912	the crowd	1901	“ But if she starts spilling the news right now , we might be swamped with people trying to get the scoop . ”
21947	21959	21960	21960	I	0	“ You ’re right . Let ’s get out of here . ”
21968	21986	21960	21960	I	0	“ You never have to ask me to leave a party twice . What about your appetizers ? ”
21987	21993	21994	21994	She	92	“ I can leave them . ”
22003	22027	21996	21996	her	92	“ I ’ll pick up the platters tomorrow , and my warming bags are already in the car . Let ’s just go . ”
22087	22106	22082	22082	she	92	“ I think we ’re safe . God , that was fun . Did you see her face ? ”
22113	22129	22082	22082	she	92	“ I had no idea what was going to come out of your mouth next . ”
22130	22134	22082	22082	she	92	“ Me neither . ”
22135	22141	22142	22142	I	0	“ Where are you parked ? ”
22145	22149	22150	22150	She	92	“ Right here . ”
22157	22160	22150	22150	She	92	“ You ? ”
22161	22167	22168	22168	I	0	“ I ’m over there . ”
22178	22188	22168	22168	I	0	“ But I ’ll walk you to your car . ”
22189	22192	22193	22193	She	92	“ Thanks . ”
22205	22217	22193	22193	She	92	“ Smells like a storm is coming , does n’t it ? ”
22218	22221	22222	22222	We	650	“ Yeah . ”
22230	22236	22222	22222	We	650	“ You still hate them ? ”
22237	22255	22256	22256	She	92	“ I do n’t really hate them , they just . . . put me on edge . ”
22261	22269	22256	22256	She	92	“ You going back to poker night ? ”
22270	22274	22275	22275	I	0	“ Hell no . ”
22289	22306	22286	22286	she	92	“ Well , you can go home early and tell her I kept you out late . ”
22328	22336	22319	22319	I	0	“ Do you want to come over ? ”
22337	22344	22286	22286	she	92	“ Sure . Have you eaten ? ”
22345	22353	22319	22319	I	0	“ No . Want to order in ? ”
22354	22371	22319	22319	I	0	“ Or I could make us something . Do you have any food at your house ? ”
22372	22378	22286	22286	she	92	“ I ’m not sure . ”
22409	22420	22421	22421	she	654	“ I ’ll hit the store on my way over , ”
22431	22439	22440	22440	She	654	“ My cooking is better than takeout . ”
22452	22461	22440	22440	She	654	“ I ’ll see you in a few ? ”
22462	22466	22467	22467	I	0	“ Sounds good . ”
22512	22521	22522	22522	she	654	“ Thanks a lot for coming here tonight , ”
22525	22534	22522	22522	she	654	“ I know it was hard for you . ”
22578	22593	22594	22594	She	654	“ I did n’t have a choice , remember ? You used the code . ”
22620	22642	22643	22643	She	654	“ I promise I wo n’t use it again unless it ’s a real emergency . Anyway , you were amazing . ”
22661	22673	22643	22643	She	654	“ It was all you . I only said three words . ”
22674	22677	22643	22643	She	654	“ Really ? ”
22678	22711	22712	22712	She	654	“ Yes , I said ‘ hi , ’ I said ‘ F , ’ and I said ‘ VVS one . ’ Some of that might not even count as words . ”
22720	22758	22712	22712	She	654	“ I guess I did do all the talking — all the lying , I mean . Which is going to turn into a big mess tomorrow once Mimi opens her mouth . But do n’t worry . ”
22768	22776	22759	22759	Her	654	“ I promise to clean it up . ”
22777	22782	22783	22783	I	0	“ I trust you , ”
22787	22803	22783	22783	I	0	“ And actually I enjoyed watching you take her down a notch every thirty seconds . ”
22812	22842	22804	22804	She	654	“ Not gon na lie , it felt pretty good . And if I never get engaged for real , at least I ’ll have the memory of tonight . ”
22858	22861	22862	22862	I	0	“ Hey , ”
22873	22889	22862	22862	I	0	“ Why do n’t I follow you to the store ? We can shop together . ”
22894	22899	22890	22890	She	654	“ You hate shopping . ”
22900	22932	22862	22862	I	0	“ I hate shopping alone . But I wo n’t be alone — I’ll have you . And I want to buy the groceries , since you ’re cooking for me . ”
22933	22936	22937	22937	she	654	“ Okay , ”
22943	22947	22937	22937	she	654	“ Follow me . ”
23211	23219	23220	23220	I	0	“ God , I love your kitchen . ”
23236	23248	23220	23220	I	0	“ I feel like I ’m in a dream right now . ”
23249	23260	23261	23261	Hutton	151	“ That ’s because you gave me the shitty job . ”
23274	23283	23270	23270	he	151	“ Sorry . Even I hate chopping onions . ”
23297	23320	23284	23284	I	0	“ But if I got to do it in this kitchen every day , even that job would n’t feel so bad . ”
23356	23363	23364	23364	I	0	“ Yeah . It ’s nice . ”
23394	23419	23376	23376	I’d	0	“ It ’s more than nice . It ’s probably good I do n’t have this kitchen . I ’d never leave my house . ”
23420	23440	23441	23441	He	151	“ You ’re welcome to use mine whenever you want . But not if you make me chop onions . ”
23449	23456	23441	23441	He	151	“ Here . I ’m done . ”
23457	23460	23461	23461	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
23577	23584	23585	23585	he	151	“ What ’s my next task ? ”
23588	23594	23595	23595	He	151	“ Is the water boiling ? ”
23608	23611	23595	23595	He	151	“ Yes . ”
23612	23622	23623	23623	He	151	“ Okay . I need a large sauté pan . ”
23634	23651	23623	23623	He	151	“ I have a bunch of pans . I ’m not sure which one you need . ”
23663	23683	23654	23654	I	0	“ You do have a bunch — and they ’re very nice . Did they come with the house ? ”
23684	23706	23707	23707	My	0	“ No . The house was furnished , but I hired someone to stock the kitchen with anything I might need . ”
23712	23718	23707	23707	My	0	“ That ’s a thing ? ”
23719	23726	23727	23727	He	151	“ Sure — for a price . ”
23744	23778	23727	23727	He	151	“ So you just say , ‘ I want a kitchen full of beautiful things , here ’s my credit card ? ’ And you do n’t have to shop for anything yourself ? ”
23779	23812	23707	23707	My	0	“ Exactly . That ’s the best part about making a lot of money — you can pay people to do the things you do n’t want to do , like shopping . ”
23813	23821	23822	23822	I	0	“ You should have just asked me , ”
23825	23841	23822	23822	I	0	“ I would have enjoyed it , and I would have done it for free . ”
23842	23854	23707	23707	My	0	“ I would n’t have let you do it for free . ”
23855	23879	23880	23880	I	0	“ Then I would have taken your money and blown it on good food and wine for us . I need olive oil , ”
23905	23909	23891	23891	He	665	“ What else ? ”
23910	23934	23935	23935	He	665	“ Dump the gnocchi in the water and keep an eye on them . Let me know when they float to the top . ”
23955	23963	23964	23964	I	0	“ So what ’s the worst part ? ”
23988	23991	23964	23964	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
23992	24025	24026	24026	He	665	“ You said being able to pay people to do things you do n’t want to do is the best part of making lots of money — so what ’s the worst ? ”
24032	24068	24026	24026	He	665	“ People assume things about you . Like that you ’re greedy or a scammer or you cheated somehow . Especially with crypto , because it ’s not easy for the average person to understand . ”
24069	24081	24082	24082	I	0	“ Like me . I do n’t get it at all , ”
24092	24105	24106	24106	he	665	“ Oh shit — I did n’t mean that to sound insulting , ”
24110	24113	24106	24106	he	665	“ Relax . ”
24119	24169	24114	24114	I	0	“ I know what you meant . And it ’s true — if you ’re not in the banking industry , crypto is not easy to understand . And when people ca n’t understand something , especially when it relates to huge sums of money , it seems sketchy . ”
24170	24263	24106	24106	he	665	“ There are sketchy people in crypto . And U.S. regulators love to find them and shut their operations down . But I ’m not one of them . And HFX is n’t perfect , but the industry is moving so fast , it ’s hard for regulators to keep up . If they wanted to work with us , they could — we could find the balance between growing the industry and preventing crimes and enforcing laws they want in place . But they ’re often more interested in playing gotcha . ”
24264	24271	24272	24272	I	0	“ It probably sells more newspapers , ”
24282	24290	24272	24272	I	0	“ And gets them re - elected . ”
24298	24313	24291	24291	Hutton	151	“ I have to testify in front of the House Committee on Financial Services . ”
24318	24326	24291	24291	Hutton	151	“ The House , meaning U.S. Congress ? ”
24327	24356	24272	24272	I	0	“ That ’s the one . I have n’t said anything about it because I was hoping to delay it . Or better yet , avoid it altogether . ”
24378	24384	24385	24385	He	151	“ When will it happen ? ”
24393	24402	24385	24385	He	151	“ In about three weeks . July 28th . ”
24403	24409	24272	24272	I	0	“ Holy shit . Alone ? ”
24410	24421	24467	24467	his	151	“ No , there will be five other CEOs there . ”
24422	24430	24385	24385	He	151	“ Well , that helps , right ? ”
24431	24455	24272	24272	I	0	“ I guess . Unless everyone else sounds like they know what they ’re talking about and I sound like a fucking idiot . ”
24456	24461	24462	24462	I	0	“ You wo n’t . ”
24470	24482	24462	24462	I	0	“ Ca n’t your partner testify instead of you ? Wade ? ”
24483	24573	24574	24574	He	151	“ He ’ll be there , but Wade does n’t do what I do . He ’s East Coast old money , a member of the club , knows all the right people — but that ’s not necessarily helpful in this situation . Wade had the capital to invest at the start and he ’s good with people , which is why we ’re a good team , but he does n’t know the back end like I do . The things are floating , by the way . ”
24580	24587	24574	24574	He	151	“ Good . Got a colander ? ”
24611	24624	24625	24625	I	0	“ So do you have a choice whether or not to testify ? ”
24628	24674	24625	24625	I	0	“ Not really . I mean , I could cash out of HFX and abandon the algorithm I created along with the company I co - founded . But that would look fucking terrible . Like I was a criminal or had things to hide . ”
24675	24683	24766	24766	he	151	“ So you have to do it ? ”
24684	24691	24766	24766	he	151	“ I have to do it . ”
24692	24702	24703	24703	I	0	“ Well , I think you ’ll be great , ”
24722	24730	24731	24731	He	151	“ I have full confidence in you . ”
24734	24742	24731	24731	He	151	“ Are you forgetting who I am ? ”
24743	24759	24760	24760	I	0	“ Not at all ! I know exactly who you are . You got this . ”
24962	24979	24980	24980	I	0	“ So were you shocked when you got that text from me with the encrypted message ? ”
24983	25000	25001	25001	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m ashamed to say it took me a minute to recognize it . ”
25004	25015	25001	25001	I	0	“ I had to write out the cipher key first . ”
25016	25019	25020	25020	Hutton	151	“ Same . ”
25030	25042	25020	25020	Hutton	151	“ But I think about that night in the library sometimes . ”
25053	25057	25043	25043	I	0	“ You do ? ”
25058	25061	25062	25062	He	151	“ Yeah . ”
25070	25081	25062	25062	He	151	“ I remember . . . what you told me . ”
25082	25089	25043	25043	I	0	“ About Carla — my mother ? ”
25093	25101	25090	25090	He	151	“ Do you ever talk to her ? ”
25102	25119	25120	25120	My	0	“ Not really . She reaches out every once in a while , but . . . ”
25125	25167	25120	25120	My	0	“ It was pretty obvious when she left that Mom was a role she was done playing . According to her , she never wanted it in the first place . At least , that ’s what she said that night . ”
25168	25184	25062	25062	He	151	“ That must have been hard . I always wondered . . . never mind . ”
25190	25198	25185	25185	Hutton	151	“ What ? You can ask me . ”
25207	25226	25199	25199	He	151	“ I guess I just wondered how that happened . How you overheard it — what she said . ”
25227	25246	25120	25120	My	0	“ I was eavesdropping on a fight my parents were having after I was supposed to be asleep . ”
25247	25250	25251	25251	He	151	“ Oh . ”
25256	25339	25251	25251	He	151	“ There was a huge thunderstorm that night , and those always made me nervous . I used to go to my parents ’ room and ask if I could sleep in their bed . Sometimes they ’d let me , other times my dad would tuck me back into my bed again and stay with me until I fell asleep . But that night , when I got out of bed and crept into the hall , I heard them fighting . ”
25340	25345	25346	25346	Hutton	151	“ I ’m sorry , ”
25350	25358	25346	25346	Hutton	151	“ They fought a lot back then . ”
25595	25640	25641	25641	Hutton	151	“ I heard her say , ‘ I never wanted your kids in the first place . I hardly want them now . ’ I remember curling my body into a ball underneath the covers , like I was trying to make myself disappear . ”
25649	25742	25641	25641	Hutton	151	“ He told her she did n’t know what she was saying . That she did n’t mean it . And she said he was n’t in charge of her thoughts and did n’t get to decide how she felt about being a mother . She said she was sick and tired of her life . And when he said they could talk about it tomorrow and they should just go to bed , she said she ’d already been to bed with someone that night , and it was n’t him . ”
25743	25746	25748	25748	Hutton	151	“ Fuck , ”
25750	25769	25748	25748	Hutton	151	“ It confused me . I did n’t understand why my mother would have a bed somewhere else . ”
25775	25805	25748	25748	Hutton	151	“ My dad said he was tired of the arguing and she should just say what she wanted , and her answer was , ‘ I want out . ’ ”
25806	25819	25820	25820	I	0	“ And she did n’t want to take you guys with her ? ”
25824	25853	25820	25820	I	0	“ No . But she would n’t have been able to anyway . The first thing my dad said was , ‘ The girls stay with me . ’ ”
25857	25863	25854	25854	He	688	“ Good for your dad . ”
25864	25928	25929	25929	I	0	“ He ’s the best . And that did make me feel good — at least my dad still loved me . But it messed with my head , you know ? Hearing my mother say those things . Up to that point , I thought all moms wanted kids . Suddenly that was n’t true . My mother did n’t want me . ”
25932	25972	25929	25929	I	0	“ I went back into the bedroom and over to the desk where Millie had been working on a project for school , and I picked up the scissors . That was the first time I cut my hair . ”
25973	25976	25854	25854	He	688	“ Ah . ”
25977	26006	25854	25854	He	688	“ The next morning , everyone asked me why I ’d done it , and I made something up . I never told anyone what I ’d overheard . ”
26007	26010	26011	26011	I	0	“ Never ? ”
26016	26110	26011	26011	I	0	“ No . I was scared of getting in trouble . All I could think of was that a good girl would not have listened . I was young , but I knew eavesdropping was wrong . I did n’t want my dad to be mad , I did n’t want my sisters to be hurt , and I was too ashamed to tell my friends . When they asked me why my mom moved out , I lied and said she had to go take care of her sick grandmother in Georgia . ”
26111	26125	25854	25854	He	688	“ That ’s a lot of baggage for a kid to carry around . ”
26126	26134	26135	26135	He	689	“ It was . But I survived . ”
26138	26152	26135	26135	He	689	“ I ’m curious . What made you tell me at the library ? ”
26153	26156	26157	26157	I	0	“ Honestly ? ”
26176	26189	26173	26173	I	0	“ I have to confess — it was kind of an accident . ”
26207	26213	26190	26190	Hutton	151	“ What do you mean ? ”
26214	26230	26173	26173	I	0	“ Well , you know how I sometimes say random things when I get nervous ? ”
26231	26239	26240	26240	He	689	“ Like being engaged to a billionaire ? ”
26252	26260	26261	26261	I	0	“ That our wedding is next month ? ”
26264	26275	26261	26261	I	0	“ Exactly . The library was one of those times . ”
26276	26286	26240	26240	He	689	“ What were you nervous about at the library ? ”
26300	26312	26292	26292	I	0	“ It ’s too embarrassing . I ca n’t tell you . ”
26313	26317	26318	26318	He	689	“ Come on . ”
26325	26334	26318	26318	He	689	“ You ’re going to laugh at me . ”
26335	26343	26344	26344	I	0	“ I wo n’t . I promise . ”
26350	26364	26344	26344	I	0	“ Okay . I was nervous because I thought you might kiss me . ”
26365	26374	26375	26375	He	689	“ And you did n’t want me to . ”
26380	26383	26375	26375	He	689	“ What ? ”
26391	26452	26384	26384	I	0	“ No ! I totally wanted you to . But I ’d never kissed a boy before , and I had no idea how to do it . I was like , ‘ What if it ’s awkward ? What if my glasses get in the way ? What do I do with my gum ? ’ Then I panicked . ”
26458	26538	26453	26453	He	689	“ Sorry , I know I said I would n’t laugh , but the two of us were having the exact same moment of panic . I wanted to kiss you and could n’t bring myself to make a move . My head was racing with all these ways it could go wrong , and I was n’t sure you even wanted me to kiss you in the first place . I thought maybe I was misreading the signs . ”
26539	26544	26545	26545	I	0	“ You were n’t , ”
26552	26581	26545	26545	I	0	“ God , can you imagine what we must have looked like ? Sitting there on the edges of our seats , our faces inches apart . . . ”
26582	26588	26590	26590	Hutton	151	“ I was sweating buckets , ”
26592	26601	26590	26590	Hutton	151	“ It was probably dripping off my forehead . ”
26602	26654	26545	26545	I	0	“ I did n’t notice . But it felt like an eternity went by and nothing happened , so I figured you must not see me like that . I had to say something to break the tension , and for whatever reason , the thing about my mom came out . ”
26655	26672	26673	26673	I	0	“ I remember having no clue what to say . So I wrote the encoded note . ”
26676	26689	26673	26673	I	0	“ That was the perfect response . It made me feel better . ”
26690	26693	26545	26545	I	0	“ Good . ”
26802	26821	26799	26799	he	696	“ It ’s probably good that we did n’t mess around back then . Do n’t you think ? ”
26829	26845	26799	26799	he	696	“ Oh , yeah . Definitely . It would have made things weird with us . ”
26846	26849	26850	26850	he	696	“ Right , ”
26862	26889	26859	26859	his	696	“ I mean , it ’s hard to say for sure , but you ’re probably right . It might not have been worth the risk . ”
26979	26993	26994	26994	I	0	“ I bet you ’re the only billionaire washing pots and pans tonight , ”
26997	27000	27001	27001	he	696	“ Probably , ”
27004	27011	27001	27001	he	696	“ I think it ’s good . ”
27017	27040	27012	27012	I	0	“ Shows character . Like you have n’t forgotten where you came from . Hand them to me and I ’ll dry . ”
27073	27087	27064	27064	Hutton	151	“ Do you want to stay a little longer ? Finish the wine ? ”
27091	27107	27088	27088	I	0	“ If we finish that bottle , I wo n’t be able to drive home . ”
27108	27113	27114	27114	he	696	“ So stay over , ”
27117	27125	27114	27114	he	696	“ I have plenty of guest rooms . ”
27126	27130	27131	27131	I	0	“ A sleepover ? ”
27143	27155	27131	27131	I	0	“ Before we ’re married ? What would the townsfolk say ? ”
27169	27199	27156	27156	He	696	“ They ’re probably already talking about us . Come on , let ’s go out on the deck . I do n’t think the rain has started yet . ”
27286	27297	27272	27272	I	0	“ It ’s so dark out here . So isolated . ”
27298	27308	27309	27309	I	0	“ That ’s what sold me on the place . ”
27316	27325	27309	27309	I	0	“ You ’re such a grumpy old man . ”
27326	27340	27272	27272	I	0	“ I ’m twenty - eight . I ’m a grumpy young man . ”
27341	27351	27352	27352	I	0	“ Fine . You ’re a grumpy young man . ”
27357	27398	27352	27352	I	0	“ But you know what ? You have to deal with a lot of people wanting to be up in your personal business all the time , so I should n’t criticize . You deserve privacy when you want it . ”
27399	27408	27409	27409	I	0	“ Can you please tell my mother that ? ”
27412	27421	27409	27409	I	0	“ I wonder what happened with Cleopatra tonight . ”
27422	27445	27352	27352	I	0	“ No idea . She said she was going to introduce her to Harvey . He ’s my dad ’s widowed friend . ”
27446	27461	27352	27352	I	0	“ Aw , that ’s nice . She just wants people to be happy . ”
27462	27472	27473	27473	Hutton	151	“ You can be happy without a serious relationship , ”
27480	27483	27473	27473	Hutton	151	“ True . ”
27500	27513	27352	27352	I	0	“ Unless you ’re lonely , or you really want a family . ”
27514	27520	27521	27521	he	151	“ I ’m never lonely , ”
27524	27530	27531	27531	I	0	“ What about a family ? ”
27534	27546	27531	27531	I	0	“ Do you ever think about getting married ? Having kids ? ”
27556	27572	27547	27547	Hutton	151	“ Not really . I do n’t know if I ’d make a good dad . ”
27607	27623	27589	27589	I	0	“ What makes you say that ? You ’re great with your nieces and nephew . ”
27624	27656	27657	27657	He	151	“ Yeah , but being an uncle is different . It ’s less pressure . You can just have fun with them . You ’re not really responsible for their upbringing . ”
27660	27707	27657	27657	He	151	“ I do n’t know if I ’d have the temperament to be a good dad . I get really irritated and impatient sometimes . I can be irrational and stubborn . My brother - in - law , Neil , is so easygoing and relaxed . ”
27708	27751	27752	27752	I	0	“ All different kinds of people can be great dads . My dad was stubborn too . He definitely got irritated . And he had such a foul mouth , the swear jaw would be overflowing by the end of the week . ”
27774	27787	27788	27788	Hutton	151	“ He was n’t perfect . But he was an awesome dad . ”
27802	27812	27799	27799	his	151	“ What about you ? Do you want kids ? ”
27813	27827	27788	27788	Hutton	151	“ I do , but I need to figure some stuff out first . ”
27828	27834	27835	27835	I	0	“ What kind of stuff ? ”
27840	27849	27835	27835	I	0	“ How to be in a healthy relationship . ”
27854	27874	27850	27850	He	151	“ I ’ve got no advice on that front . I ’d be an even shittier husband than father . ”
27875	27882	27835	27835	I	0	“ What makes you think that ? ”
27883	27886	27850	27850	He	151	“ Experience . ”
27887	27891	27892	27892	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? ”
27897	27917	27892	27892	I	0	“ Is there a wife you ’re hiding somewhere ? As your fake fiancée , I should know this . ”
27925	27959	27918	27918	He	151	“ No , I ’ve never been married . But I ’ve tried to have relationships , and I suck at them . I have literally been told that I suck at them . ”
27960	27966	27967	27967	He	151	“ That ’s not nice . ”
27970	27975	27967	27967	He	151	“ It ’s honest . ”
27976	27989	27918	27918	He	151	“ I guess I ’d value kindness over honesty in that situation . ”
27990	28003	28004	28004	I	0	“ Did n’t matter . And I did n’t even really care . ”
28018	28025	28004	28004	I	0	“ Are we talking about Zlatka ? ”
28026	28069	27918	27918	He	151	“ She ’s the one who told me I sucked most recently , but she ’s not the only one who felt that way — and I never blamed them . No one wants to date a recluse who hates going places . ”
28070	28083	28004	28004	I	0	“ That ’s all it was ? You never liked going out ? ”
28084	28116	28117	28117	He	151	“ That was a lot of it . But there were other problems too . I ’m not good at talking about things . I ’m better at — never mind . ”
28134	28137	28138	28138	I	0	“ What ? ”
28143	28147	28138	28138	I	0	“ Tell me . ”
28148	28161	28140	28140	him	151	“ I ’m better at the physical stuff than the emotional stuff . ”
28176	28182	28168	28168	I	0	“ You mean sex stuff ? ”
28183	28186	28138	28138	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
28187	28195	28196	28196	I	0	“ Well , that ’s important too , ”
28219	28226	28227	28227	He	151	“ Good physical chemistry with someone . ”
28237	28257	28227	28227	He	151	“ Actually , I do n’t even think Zlatka and I were that compatible when it came to sex . ”
28258	28262	28202	28202	he	151	“ Why not ? ”
28263	28273	28274	28274	I	0	“ Certain things I liked , she did n’t . ”
28281	28285	28286	28286	He	151	“ Such as ? ”
28289	28316	28286	28286	He	151	“ Let ’s just say that Zlatka does not like being told what to do or not do , and I enjoy that kind of control . ”
28328	28372	28317	28317	I	0	“ But there were other problems . She constantly accused me of avoiding any situation or conversation I did n’t want to be in , and she was right . I do avoid those . Eventually , our relationship fell into that category . ”
28373	28380	28286	28286	He	151	“ You do n’t miss her ? ”
28381	28396	28397	28397	He	151	“ Fuck no . She was exhausting . And I ’ve never missed anyone . ”
28402	28424	28397	28397	He	151	“ I mean , except for you . There have been many times in my life when I ’ve missed you . ”
28428	28431	28425	28425	I	0	“ Really ? ”
28432	28435	28470	28470	he	151	“ Yes . ”
28436	28443	28425	28425	I	0	“ I ’ve missed you too . ”
28491	28494	28495	28495	He	151	“ Oh ! ”
28509	28513	28495	28495	He	151	“ You okay ? ”
28514	28519	28495	28495	He	151	“ Yes . Sorry . ”
28529	28536	28524	28524	I	0	“ Storms still make me jumpy . ”
28537	28543	28544	28544	Hutton	151	“ Let ’s go in . ”
28557	28573	28544	28544	Hutton	151	“ I ’ll show you the guest rooms , and you can take your pick . ”
28574	28586	28587	28587	I	0	“ Are you sure it ’s okay for me to stay ? ”
28594	28618	28619	28619	he	151	“ Yes . I could call and ask my mom , but I ’m pretty sure she ’d be in favor of it , ”
28631	28659	28619	28619	he	151	“ Mine too . Actually , I am going to text her and let her know I ’m staying here , just so she does n’t worry . ”
28660	28664	28628	28628	his	151	“ Good idea . ”
28707	28712	28713	28713	I	0	“ This is perfect , ”
28728	28746	28722	28722	Hutton	151	“ The other two bedrooms are on the lower level , if you ’d like more privacy . ”
28747	28769	28770	28770	He	151	“ Listen , I ’ve been living with my parents and two teenage sisters for six months . This is heaven . ”
28773	28782	28770	28770	He	151	“ Okay . Can I get you anything ? ”
28783	28800	28808	28808	he	151	“ Got a spare toothbrush ? Maybe an old T - shirt I could sleep in ? ”
28801	28806	28808	28808	he	151	“ Be right back . ”
28895	28900	28871	28871	Hutton	151	“ Will this work ? ”
28901	28907	28908	28908	I	0	“ Yes . Thank you . ”
28942	28947	28934	28934	He	151	“ Need anything else ? ”
28948	28955	28934	28934	He	151	“ Nope . I ’m good . ”
28966	28970	28963	28963	I	0	“ You okay ? ”
28971	28974	28975	28975	I	0	“ No . ”
28989	28998	28983	28983	I	0	“ Can I sleep in your bed tonight ? ”
29005	29010	29011	29011	I	0	“ I ’m kidding , ”
29019	29036	29011	29011	I	0	“ Because of what I told you earlier . Do n’t worry , I wo n’t — ”
29037	29045	28983	28983	I	0	“ You can if you want to . ”
29046	29057	29011	29011	I	0	“ — actually crawl into your . . . huh ? ”
29058	29079	29011	29011	I	0	“ You can sleep in my bed . If you want to . I mean , if you ’re scared . ”
29113	29122	29109	29109	I	0	“ Thanks . But I ’ll be fine . ”
29123	29128	29129	29129	He	151	“ Okay . Goodnight . ”

29555	29558	29544	29544	she	715	“ Thirsty . ”
29559	29562	29563	29563	I	0	“ Right , ”
29566	29574	29563	29563	I	0	“ That ’s why I ’m here . ”
29575	29579	29544	29544	she	715	“ It is ? ”
29580	29613	29614	29614	I	0	“ Yes , I thought you might be thirsty and I forgot to tell you there are bottles of water in the fridge . Why do n’t I just get you one ? ”
29786	29798	29777	29777	Zlatka	96	“ I want you . Let ’s get out of here . ”
29858	29861	29856	29856	she	715	“ Hutton ? ”
29944	29954	29955	29955	She	715	“ Sorry , did n’t mean to scare you . ”

30113	30143	30107	30107	She	715	“ Oh . Yeah . This morning , after I saw the bad review on that app . It looks terrible , I know . It ’s all uneven . ”

30842	30846	30815	30815	she	715	“ My mom ? ”
30864	30867	30854	30854	I	0	“ Here ? ”

31680	31703	31673	31674	my mom	465	“ No wonder he always protested so much when I tried to help him find love . He ’d already found it ! ”
31704	31712	31714	31714	Zosia	108	“ But why was it a secret ? ”
31722	31729	31714	31714	Zosia	108	“ I do n’t get it . ”
31730	31761	31763	31764	my sister	238	“ Because when you ’re someone like Hutton , the media is always prying into your business , and taking a relationship public puts a lot of pressure on it , ”
31766	31771	31763	31764	my sister	238	“ Right , Hutton ? ”
31772	31777	31714	31714	Zosia	108	“ Uh , yes . ”
31778	31818	31819	31820	My mother	454	“ And the sad eyes and discontent aura I sensed yesterday must have been his yearning to share the news with us , but feeling protective of his blossoming love ! But in retrospect , it was right there . ”
31838	31845	31832	31832	Her	454	“ Gentlemen . A song please ? ”
31871	31876	31862	31862	Harvey	122	“ Congratulations to you , ”
31891	31905	31906	31906	they	740	“ Congratulations to you . Congratulations on your engagement , congratulations toooooo youuuuuuu , ”
31933	31936	31943	31943	her	238	“ Pic ! ”
31946	31950	31943	31943	her	238	“ Everyone in ! ”
32013	32020	32021	32021	she	71	“ How about smiling this time ? ”
32027	32042	32021	32021	she	71	“ Hutton and Felicity , you two look like you ’ve seen a ghost . ”
32080	32088	32089	32090	my mother	454	“ Now one of the happy couple , ”
32099	32109	32093	32093	I	0	“ Mom , really , this is n’t the — ”
32110	32119	32120	32120	she	71	“ Oh , now do n’t be shy , ”
32130	32153	32120	32120	she	71	“ Put your arm around her , Hutton ! You ’re in love ! And the poor girl is trembling with excitement . ”
32175	32191	32192	32192	Felicity	151	“ Um , Mrs. French , everyone , there ’s something I need to explain , ”
32195	32202	32192	32192	Felicity	151	“ Please . Call me Mom . ”
32211	32253	32254	32254	She	465	“ And there ’s nothing to explain . It ’s the oldest story in the book — boy meets girl , they ’re just friends for years , then they realize that there ’s always been something more there . . . ”
32259	32281	32254	32254	She	465	“ It ’s like the universe has answered all my prayers . Now I can stop worrying about you , Hutton . ”
32282	32286	32203	32203	My	0	“ You can ? ”
32287	32290	32291	32291	She	465	“ Yes . ”
32295	32320	32291	32291	She	465	“ No more trying to set you up , because clearly you ’ve realized that your soul mate has been right here all along . ”
32326	32336	32323	32323	her	465	“ I ’m so sorry about this , but — ”
32337	32343	32344	32345	My mother	454	“ Do n’t be sorry . ”
32348	32383	32384	32384	she	465	“ We understand wanting to keep the news to yourselves . It ’s only natural to want to hold a secret like that close to your heart . But now that it ’s out , ”
32389	32407	32384	32384	she	465	“ I ca n’t wait to celebrate ! And is it true the wedding is next month ? ”
32408	32413	32441	32442	my sister	238	“ Uh . . . ”
32423	32430	32384	32384	she	465	“ Where did you hear that ? ”
32431	32439	32441	32442	my sister	238	“ Oh , the news is everywhere , ”
32444	32491	32492	32492	She	454	“ Online , local morning news , social media . You ’ve been secretly engaged for weeks , and you ’re having a very intimate wedding at Cloverleigh Farms in August . At least five friends texted me the headlines and asked if it was true . ”
32495	32517	32492	32492	She	454	“ I had my doubts , but Mom was positive the universe would not play such a cruel trick on her . ”
32518	32538	32539	32540	my mother	454	“ And I was right ! Just look at them — it ’s obvious what ’s been going on , ”
32557	32564	32566	32566	Neil	99	“ Hope we did n’t interrupt , ”
32571	32575	32566	32566	Neil	99	“ Say cheese ! ”
32582	32588	32566	32566	Neil	99	“ How about a kiss ? ”
32589	32593	32576	32577	My sister	238	“ A what ? ”
32609	32613	32601	32601	I	0	“ A kiss ! ”
32621	32632	32601	32601	I	0	“ For the camera . For prosperity . For love ! ”
32633	32636	32642	32642	her	238	“ Exactly , ”
32647	32653	32642	32642	her	238	“ Kiss her , Hutton . ”
32710	32717	32693	32694	My mother	454	“ Let Me Call You Sweetheart . ”
32795	32803	32804	32805	my sister	238	“ Okay , I got the picture , ”
32814	32819	32821	32821	Neil	99	“ Get a room ! ”
32823	32835	32821	32821	Neil	99	“ That ’s gross . Can we have the donuts now ? ”
32857	32863	32864	32864	she	548	“ I’m — I’m confused , ”
32867	32872	32864	32864	she	548	“ Come with me . ”
32889	32894	32895	32895	Neil	99	“ I was kidding ! ”
32901	32908	32909	32910	my mother	454	“ Oh , let them go , ”
32913	32931	32909	32910	my mother	454	“ They probably need a moment to themselves — we barged right into their love nest unannounced . ”
32961	32966	32967	32967	she	548	“ Oh my God , ”
32970	32976	32967	32967	she	548	“ I ’m so sorry . ”
32977	32982	32984	32984	Felicity	151	“ Do n’t be . ”
32996	33042	32984	32984	Felicity	151	“ I should n’t have opened my big mouth to Mimi . I knew this would happen . I just did n’t think about the consequences of your family hearing the news and being so happy about it ! And it ’s not just them . ”
33043	33049	32984	32984	Felicity	151	“ What do you mean ? ”
33050	33079	32984	32984	Felicity	151	“ When I turned on my phone this morning , I saw that Winnie had sent me a bunch of headlines about us — we’re front page news ! ”
33080	33084	32984	32984	Felicity	151	“ We are ? ”
33085	33140	33141	33141	She	781	“ Yes ! My follower count skyrocketed overnight . I ’ve got tons of DMs . My notifications on Dearly Beloved are blowing up . And my mother — Frannie , I mean — left me a voicemail , which I have n’t listened to , but I can imagine what it ’s about . ”
33153	33174	33141	33141	She	781	“ Now I have to tell everyone the truth — that I made it up . This is so embarrassing . ”
33175	33181	33182	33182	My	0	“ Okay , hang on . ”
33187	33198	33182	33182	My	0	“ Maybe we do n’t have to tell everyone that . ”
33199	33202	33203	33203	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
33211	33221	33203	33203	I	0	“ Maybe we can just — go with it . ”
33222	33227	33182	33182	My	0	“ Go with it ? ”
33228	33238	33239	33239	Her	781	“ Yes — for a little while at least . ”
33244	33247	33239	33239	Her	781	“ Why ? ”
33248	33269	33270	33270	Felicity	151	“ You heard my mother . She ’s finally going to leave me alone . Maybe everyone else will too . ”
33279	33284	33270	33270	Felicity	151	“ Are you serious ? ”
33285	33339	33340	33340	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m tired of being harassed by everyone around me about my lack of a personal life . I ’ve got a lot of work to do to get ready to testify , and if people think we ’re engaged , they ’ll give me the space to do it , ”
33386	33391	33344	33344	I	0	“ For how long ? ”
33392	33399	33400	33400	I	0	“ Just while I ’m here , ”
33403	33422	33400	33400	I	0	“ I only rented the house for three months . I have to be out by August fifteenth . ”
33428	33433	33423	33423	She	782	“ So one month ? ”
33434	33437	33438	33438	I	0	“ Right . ”
33467	33473	33474	33474	She	782	“ What do you think ? ”
33477	33495	33474	33474	She	782	“ I think there ’s going to be a lot of disappointed Prancin ’ Grannies out there . ”
33496	33503	33532	33532	She	782	“ So you ’ll do it ? ”
33504	33510	33474	33474	She	782	“ Of course I will . ”
33511	33531	33474	33474	She	782	“ It ’ll mean lying to your family . . . are you sure you ’re up for that ? ”
33541	33585	33532	33532	She	782	“ But we ’re not hurting anyone . My family will actually be overjoyed . The only problem will be when we have to end it . But I guess we could just call it off when you go back to San Francisco . ”
33586	33590	33474	33474	She	782	“ Sounds reasonable . ”
33591	33605	33606	33606	She	782	“ Except that I said we were getting married next month ! Shit ! ”
33617	33629	33606	33606	She	782	“ Look , let ’s not worry about that right now . ”
33630	33647	33648	33648	Felicity	151	“ But we have to get the story straight , Hutton . We need a script . ”
33657	33666	33650	33650	her	782	“ Otherwise I ’m liable to go rogue . ”
33667	33676	33677	33677	I	0	“ We can come up with a story . ”
33684	33698	33699	33699	Felicity	151	“ For now , let ’s just try to get rid of them . ”
33702	33718	33699	33699	Felicity	151	“ Maybe if we just stay in your bedroom , they ’ll take a hint . ”
33727	33731	33699	33699	Felicity	151	“ I wish . ”
33793	33800	33802	33803	my mother	454	“ Come sit , you two , ”
33817	33830	33802	33803	my mother	454	“ We want to hear all about how you popped the question . ”
33831	33838	33839	33839	I	0	“ That ’s private , Mom . ”
33851	33859	33860	33860	Allie	71	“ Come on , just tell us , ”
33863	33871	33860	33860	Allie	71	“ And let ’s see the ring . ”
33882	33898	33872	33872	Felicity	151	“ The ring is actually still at the jeweler ’s . It ’s being sized . ”
33899	33913	33915	33915	Zosia	108	“ Grandma says this means you ’ve gotten over your emotional devoidance issues , ”
33927	33932	33915	33915	Zosia	108	“ Is that true ? ”
33933	33944	33945	33945	My	0	“ Emotional avoidance issues , and do n’t say that . ”
33954	33970	33948	33949	her daughter	793	“ Just tell me — did he get down on one knee when he proposed ? ”
33978	33983	33971	33972	My mother	454	“ Was it romantic ? ”
34002	34005	34006	34006	she	454	“ Yes , ”
34015	34028	34006	34006	she	454	“ He got down on one knee and it was very romantic . ”
34029	34034	34035	34035	Allie	71	“ Where were you ? ”
34038	34041	34035	34035	Allie	71	“ Here . ”
34048	34054	34045	34045	her	454	“ Out in the woods . ”
34055	34062	34009	34009	her	454	“ You proposed in the woods ? ”
34070	34089	34009	34009	her	454	“ That makes sense for an earth sign like Taurus . And what sign are you , Felicity ? ”
34090	34114	34045	34045	her	454	“ I ’m a Cancer . My birthday just passed — in fact , that ’s when he asked me to marry him . ”
34122	34127	34115	34115	Felicity	151	“ On my birthday . ”
34128	34135	34136	34137	My mother	454	“ Oh , that ’s perfect . ”
34141	34154	34136	34137	My mother	454	“ An earthy bull is a wonderful match for a sensitive crab . ”
34164	34177	34178	34178	I	0	“ Mom , calling someone a sensitive crab is not a compliment , ”
34182	34194	34195	34196	my mother	454	“ I ’m saying you ’re going to be good together , ”
34200	34255	34195	34196	my mother	454	“ Both Taurus and Cancer are very family - oriented . But a Cancer might struggle with someone who is n’t in touch with his feelings , Hutton , so you ’ll have to take care not to let her down . She ’ll snatch her feelings right back into her little crab shell . ”
34256	34264	34265	34265	Allie	71	“ Let ’s talk about the wedding , ”
34268	34278	34265	34265	Allie	71	“ It ’s going to be at Cloverleigh Farms ? ”
34279	34284	34286	34286	Felicity	151	“ I think so , ”
34288	34308	34286	34286	Felicity	151	“ I just need to confirm some details with my sister Millie . She ’s the wedding planner there . ”
34309	34315	34265	34265	Allie	71	“ What ’s the date ? ”
34316	34329	34330	34330	She	71	“ Um , that ’s one of the details to be confirmed . ”
34335	34342	34330	34330	She	71	“ We ’re hoping for August . ”
34349	34369	34343	34344	My father	453	“ So are you moving here for good , son ? Or will you two move to San Francisco ? ”
34375	34385	34370	34370	I	0	“ Plans are up in the air right now . ”
34386	34394	34396	34396	Zosia	108	“ Can I come to the wedding ? ”
34399	34402	34396	34396	Zosia	108	“ Please ? ”
34403	34409	34411	34412	my mother	454	“ Of course you can , ”
34414	34424	34425	34425	Allie	71	“ Out of curiosity , what ’s the rush ? ”
34434	34445	34425	34425	Allie	71	“ Is there anything else you want to tell us ? ”
34446	34449	34450	34450	Felicity	151	“ No , ”
34459	34470	34471	34472	my mom	465	“ Alexandra , the reason for the rush is obvious , ”
34483	34500	34471	34472	my mom	465	“ They ’re in love ! And they ’re perfect together , do n’t you agree ? ”
34510	34526	34507	34507	her	238	“ I agree . A bull and a crab are a match made in heaven . ”
34627	34634	34635	34635	Neil	99	“ He ’s a great guy , ”
34638	34644	34635	34635	Neil	99	“ That ’s your uncle ? ”
34645	34655	34656	34656	Felicity	151	“ He ’s married to my stepmom ’s sister , ”
34659	34678	34656	34656	Felicity	151	“ But I grew up in that family , so they ’re all aunts and uncles to me . ”
34679	34686	34688	34689	my mom	465	“ The Sawyers are wonderful people , ”
34691	34709	34688	34689	my mom	465	“ In fact , I ca n’t wait to speak with Frannie about the wedding and everything . ”
34710	34716	34717	34717	I	0	“ Not yet , Mom , ”
34730	34751	34717	34717	I	0	“ This news sort of got out unexpectedly , so give us a chance to talk to the MacAllisters first . ”
34752	34763	34764	34764	Felicity	151	“ So where can I see your next singing performance ? ”
34837	34840	34819	34819	I	0	“ Jesus . ”
34849	34862	34841	34841	Felicity	151	“ That was . . . a lot . Are you okay ? ”
34863	34868	34869	34869	She	454	“ Yeah . You ? ”
34872	34901	34869	34869	She	454	“ You think they bought everything ? I feel like your parents were convinced , but sometimes your sister would look at us like she was n’t sure . ”
34902	34930	34841	34841	Felicity	151	“ Allie is pretty shrewd , but mostly I think she was just amazed I ’d kept a secret from her . I usually tell her everything . ”
34931	34948	34869	34869	She	454	“ I love that you ’re close to your sister . I think that ’s cool . ”
34956	34981	34953	34953	she	815	“ Okay , come on . Let ’s get the kitchen cleaned up and figure out how we ’re going to handle my family . ”
35039	35047	35048	35048	she	815	“ I ’ll wash , you dry ? ”
35051	35059	35048	35048	she	815	“ Sure . But — hang on . ”
35068	35072	35060	35060	I	0	“ That kiss . ”
35079	35084	35073	35073	She	815	“ What about it ? ”
35085	35096	35128	35128	she	815	“ I did n’t see a way out of it . ”
35097	35104	35105	35105	She	815	“ No . Of course not . ”
35131	35151	35128	35128	she	815	“ Is n’t it amazing that this was formed millions of years ago because of heat and intense pressure ? ”
35202	35214	35196	35196	she	815	“ I did n’t mind when you kissed me , Hutton . ”
35215	35220	35221	35221	She	815	“ You did n’t ? ”
35226	35239	35223	35223	her	815	“ At least now we know what it ’s like , right ? ”
35240	35243	35244	35244	She	815	“ Right . ”
35252	35268	35244	35244	She	815	“ In fact , we ’ll probably have to do that kind of thing again . ”
35277	35280	35244	35244	She	815	“ Kiss ? ”
35281	35298	35299	35299	She	815	“ Yeah . I mean , people are going to expect it if we ’re engaged . ”
35304	35309	35299	35299	She	815	“ Wo n’t they ? ”
35324	35335	35310	35310	I	0	“ So I was thinking , maybe we should practice . ”
35343	35347	35310	35310	I	0	“ Right now ? ”
35348	35363	35364	35364	Her	815	“ Maybe not right this second , but you know . . . soon . ”
35368	35380	35364	35364	Her	815	“ Do n’t you think it would be a good idea ? ”
35381	35390	35310	35310	I	0	“ Yeah . Soon . Practice . Good . ”
35396	35399	35310	35310	I	0	“ Great . ”
35411	35417	35418	35418	I	0	“ You should move in , ”
35434	35437	35418	35418	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
35438	35446	35447	35447	I	0	“ You should move in with me . ”
35455	35471	35447	35447	I	0	“ It would make things more real , more believable . Do n’t you think ? ”
35472	35486	35487	35487	Her	815	“ Um . Yes . Definitely , it would make it more real . ”
35493	35510	35487	35487	Her	815	“ It ’s just — I don’t — I did n’t know if you . . . ”
35511	35519	35447	35447	I	0	“ Did n’t know if I what ? ”
35520	35534	35487	35487	Her	815	“ If you , you know , wanted to make it more real . ”
35543	35547	35487	35487	Her	815	“ I do . ”
35566	35603	35557	35557	she	815	“ Okay . I ’ll go home this afternoon and get my stuff . It will be nice to get out of my parents ’ house , even if it ’s just for a few weeks . ”
35604	35607	35608	35608	We	819	“ Great . ”
35672	35677	35678	35678	Winnie	89	“ It ’s true ? ”
35687	35690	35678	35678	Winnie	89	“ Yes . ”
35709	35727	35691	35691	I	0	“ It ’s true . Hutton and I are engaged . I ’m moving in with him . ”
35728	35748	35791	35791	Hutton	151	“ I ca n’t believe it ! Why did n’t you say something yesterday ? I ’m freaking out ! ”
35749	35776	35777	35777	I	0	“ Sorry . I wanted to , but Hutton and I had agreed to keep it quiet for a while . You know how he is . ”
35816	35869	35801	35801	he	151	“ I remember him being quiet and shy , yes , but I did n’t realize you two were a thing . You always swore there was nothing there ! The words ‘ just friends ’ have come out of your mouth a million times ! You were like a broken record . ”
35870	35875	35876	35876	I	0	“ It was true , ”
35880	35909	35876	35876	I	0	“ Right up until recently . When he came back to town this summer , we realized we had feelings for each other we ’d never admitted to . ”
35910	35930	35931	35931	I	0	“ God , we are so different . I ’d have tattooed his name on my body by now . ”
35934	35937	35931	35931	I	0	“ Probably . ”
35938	35948	35950	35950	her	821	“ You know everyone saw it except you two . ”
35955	35964	35950	35950	her	821	“ Yes , well , now we do . ”
35995	36025	35989	35989	he	151	“ This is so amazing . But you know me — I’m going to need every single , solitary detail , and I ’m going to need them now . ”
36026	36059	36076	36076	he	151	“ I do n’t have time right now , but I ’ll tell you at dinner tonight . Hutton and I are hosting everyone here , and I ’m going to cook . ”
36180	36187	36188	36188	Winnie	89	“ Are Mom and Dad coming ? ”
36191	36200	36188	36188	Winnie	89	“ Yes . I just talked to Mom . ”
36201	36206	36152	36152	I	0	“ Did she cry ? ”
36207	36210	36211	36211	I	0	“ Yep , ”
36221	36263	36211	36211	I	0	“ Burst into tears the minute she answered the phone , but she ’s happy . She ’s at work and the bakery is super busy , but she made me promise to tell her everything the moment she gets here . ”
36264	36272	36273	36273	Winnie	89	“ I ca n’t wait until dinnertime , ”
36276	36284	36273	36273	Winnie	89	“ Ca n’t you tell me sooner ? ”
36285	36291	36292	36292	I	0	“ I really ca n’t , ”
36311	36336	36337	36337	Winnie	89	“ But I promise it will be worth the wait . I ’ll text you Hutton ’s address and you can come around four . ”
36341	36358	36337	36337	Winnie	89	“ Fine . But call Mills right now , okay ? She ’s losing her mind . ”
36392	36396	36382	36382	she	83	“ I will . ”
36397	36409	36410	36410	She	89	“ God . You ’re getting married , Lissy . Married . ”
36415	36422	36410	36410	She	89	“ I ca n’t believe it . ”
36423	36427	36382	36382	she	83	“ Me neither . ”
36428	36462	36382	36382	she	83	“ I ’m so happy for you . How awesome to fall in love with a friend . And how sweet that you two have been friends since , what , high school ? ”
36463	36467	36468	36468	I	0	“ Middle school , ”
36471	36481	36468	36468	I	0	“ He moved in the middle of seventh grade . ”
36656	36666	36667	36667	I	0	“ But we were n’t super close right away , ”
36670	36675	36667	36667	I	0	“ That took time . ”
36679	36710	36676	36676	Winnie	89	“ Yes , you guys have been very good at taking your time — until now . Suddenly everything is lightning fast . Are you really getting married next month ? ”
36711	36730	36667	36667	I	0	“ Um , hopefully . I still need to talk to Millie . See if it ’s doable . ”
36731	36748	36749	36749	she	89	“ Well , if it ’s not doable at Cloverleigh , let ’s talk about Abelard , ”
36759	36801	36752	36752	Winnie	89	“ I totally understand wanting to have it at Cloverleigh Farms , but if you ca n’t get a date at such late notice , I might be able to help you out , especially if you can wait until September . ”
36802	36810	36811	36811	I	0	“ Hutton will be gone by then , ”
36816	36838	36811	36811	I	0	“ Gone ? What do you mean ? Does that mean you ’re moving too ? What about your catering business ? ”
36846	36879	36811	36811	I	0	“ Not sure of anything yet , but Hutton only has this house for about another month . Where we ’ll live is one of the decisions we ’ll have to make . ”
36880	36889	36752	36752	Winnie	89	“ I saw that your follower count exploded . ”
36890	36917	36752	36752	Winnie	89	“ So did my DMs . Clearly getting engaged to a public figure helps your influencer status . I ’m suddenly inundated with requests to collaborate . ”
36918	36924	36811	36811	I	0	“ That ’s so exciting ! ”
36925	36940	36943	36943	her	840	“ I have a bunch of new messages in my Dearly Beloved inbox too , ”
36949	36987	36941	36941	I	0	“ I have n’t even looked at them yet . Anyway , I have to go , but I ’ll see you here at four . Feel free to bring Dex and the girls if you want . ”
36988	36999	36811	36811	I	0	“ Will all of Hutton ’s family be there too ? ”
37000	37018	36811	36811	I	0	“ No . We saw them for brunch this morning . It ’s just the MacAllisters tonight . ”
37019	37046	37048	37048	she	841	“ Pretty soon , your name wo n’t be MacAllister anymore . You ’ll be Felicity French ! If you change your name , I mean . ”
37051	37066	37048	37048	she	841	“ I ’d like to be Winnie Matthews someday . You ’re so lucky . ”
37067	37076	37077	37077	We	842	“ Thanks . I ’ll see you later . ”
37267	37271	37259	37259	She	83	“ Running away ? ”
37287	37295	37261	37261	her	83	“ I was going to call you . ”
37296	37301	37261	37261	her	83	“ And say what ? ”
37302	37312	37261	37261	her	83	“ Um , that I ’m engaged to Hutton ? ”
37325	37331	37332	37332	I	0	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
37335	37344	37345	37345	she	83	“ You ’re not really engaged to Hutton , ”
37352	37395	37349	37349	her	83	“ There is no way you ’ve been secretly dating him for a month . I talk to you every day . I see you all the time . I just asked you about him yesterday . Now tell me the truth . ”
37406	37415	37396	37396	I	0	“ The truth is . . . complicated . ”
37416	37423	37349	37349	her	83	“ Good thing I ’m smart . ”
37424	37432	37482	37482	Millie	83	“ And it ’s a long story . ”
37433	37441	37349	37349	her	83	“ Good thing I ’ve got time . ”
37488	37495	37482	37482	Millie	83	“ The thing is . . . ”
37539	37587	37535	37535	I	0	“ The thing is , I opened my big mouth at the reunion last night when Mimi Pepper - Peabody - soon - to - be - Van Pelt cornered me and made me feel bad about myself , and I said I was engaged to Hutton . ”
37593	37598	37588	37588	Millie	83	“ Oh , shit . ”
37599	37621	37523	37525	my big sister	341	“ Then I hid in a coat closet and begged him to come to the reunion and pretend it was true . ”
37622	37627	37628	37628	I	0	“ And he did ? ”
37631	37681	37628	37628	I	0	“ He showed up in a suit and tie just like I asked and stood there while I said a bunch of ridiculous things to Mimi and her fiancé about our wedding , including the fact that it ’s taking place at Cloverleigh Farms at the end of August . ”
37682	37701	37523	37525	my big sister	341	“ I know . I read about it on dirty - little - scoop - dot - com . ”
37702	37709	37710	37710	She	83	“ You read that tabloid crap ? ”
37713	37727	37710	37710	She	83	“ I ca n’t help it . I ’m addicted to celebrity gossip . ”
37741	37790	37728	37728	I	0	“ I do n’t know how it all got out so quickly . It was just supposed to be a fun game for the night , a way to get back at Mimi for being such a twat - waffle . I told her not to say anything . ”
37791	37803	37804	37804	Millie	83	“ Well , it ’s out there now . Somehow it — ”
37807	37825	37804	37804	Millie	83	“ Wait , did you say Van Pelt ? Is that Mimi ’s fiancé ’s last name ? ”
37826	37835	37836	37836	I	0	“ Yeah . He has a funny name . ”
37842	37849	37836	37836	I	0	“ Thornton ! Thornton Van Pelt . ”
37850	37858	37859	37859	Millie	83	“ That ’s how it got out , ”
37862	37903	37859	37859	Millie	83	“ The Van Pelts own a media conglomerate — websites , cable networks , newspapers , social media , online tabloids . I bet they own Dirty Little Scoop . Basically , you told the worst possible people your secret . ”
37904	37907	37908	37908	My	0	“ Shit . ”
37921	37927	37928	37928	Millie	83	“ I had no idea . ”
37937	37985	37928	37928	Millie	83	“ So that explains why you ’re a viral news sensation today . But the question is , why are n’t you denying it ? Why not just say it was a joke ? Because Frannie and Dad and Winnie all think this is a real thing . ”
37986	37995	37996	37996	I	0	“ Did you tell them it was n’t ? ”
38005	38021	37996	37996	I	0	“ No . I did n’t want to say anything until I talked to you . ”
38035	38074	38022	38022	She	83	“ But you were ignoring all my attempts to reach out , so I had to hunt you down like a fugitive . Now what is up ? Why did n’t you tell Frannie and Dad the truth ? ”
38075	38083	38084	38084	Millie	83	“ Because Hutton asked me not to . ”
38089	38092	38084	38084	Millie	83	“ Why ? ”
38093	38119	38022	38022	She	83	“ I can explain , but I want to get off the porch before I run into them . Can we go for coffee somewhere ? ”
38120	38124	38126	38126	Millie	83	“ We can , ”
38128	38163	38126	38126	Millie	83	“ but you might run into a lot of people pointing and whispering . This is a small town without much else to talk about , and you guys just set it on fire . ”
38164	38178	38179	38179	I	0	“ You ’re right . Okay , let ’s go to your house . ”
38337	38343	38344	38344	She	83	“ So wait . . . ”
38350	38362	38344	38344	She	83	“ You spent the night in separate rooms ? Nothing happened ? ”
38363	38371	38372	38372	I	0	“ Nothing happened , but . . . ”
38378	38386	38372	38372	I	0	“ I sort of wanted it to . ”
38392	38396	38387	38387	Her	83	“ Keep going . ”
38397	38410	38344	38344	She	83	“ I do n’t know , something just seems different between us . ”
38411	38420	38344	38344	She	83	“ All summer ? Or starting last night ? ”
38421	38489	38387	38387	Her	83	“ Maybe it ’s been all summer . It ’s hard to say — I feel close to him , which is kind of crazy since we went a long time without seeing each other . But when he moved back and we started hanging out again , it was like no time had passed at all — and also like there was some new layer there . ”
38490	38494	38495	38495	she	83	“ Sexual tension ? ”
38514	38528	38504	38504	My	0	“ Yeah . But it ’s scary to think about crossing that line . ”
38529	38553	38554	38554	She	83	“ That ’s understandable . You ’ve been friends for so long , it ’s harder than crossing the line with a stranger . ”
38570	38605	38562	38562	I	0	“ And what if I ’m wrong ? What if he is n’t into me that way ? What if he really was knocking on my bedroom door to ask if I was thirsty ? ”
38606	38609	38610	38610	Millie	83	“ Wait . ”
38622	38639	38610	38610	Millie	83	“ He knocked on your bedroom door after you guys had gone to bed last night ? ”
38640	38643	38644	38644	My	0	“ Yeah . ”
38648	38654	38644	38644	My	0	“ Without a shirt on . ”
38655	38663	38664	38664	she	83	“ He ’s into you that way , ”
38668	38677	38678	38678	I	0	“ Also , he kissed me this morning , ”
38688	38691	38678	38678	I	0	“ Oh ? ”
38696	38757	38758	38758	I	0	“ It was just for show — his sister was taking pictures — but it was nice . Right after that was when he dragged me into the bedroom to say we should keep up the ruse so his mom and everyone else in town will stop bugging him about being single . He needs peace and quiet to work . ”
38766	38774	38758	38758	I	0	“ He ’s really nervous about it . ”
38775	38796	38797	38797	Millie	83	“ I do n’t blame him . That would be scary for anyone , but especially for someone with anxiety . ”
38802	38818	38797	38797	Millie	83	“ So the plan is to keep up the charade until he leaves for D.C. ? ”
38819	38833	38797	38797	Millie	83	“ I think so . We have n’t really discussed the ending yet . ”
38834	38849	38850	38850	I	0	“ But you ’re not actually going to plan a wedding , are you ? ”
38857	38871	38850	38850	I	0	“ I ’m not sure . But I am moving in with him . ”
38872	38880	38797	38797	Millie	83	“ You ’re moving in with him ? ”
38885	38911	38881	38881	Her	83	“ Yes . He suggested it this morning , to make it look more real . . . right after I suggested we practice kissing . ”
38915	38922	38912	38912	She	83	“ This is nuts , Felicity . ”
38923	38935	38850	38850	I	0	“ But it could be kind of fun , you know ? ”
38936	38941	38850	38850	I	0	“ Lying to everyone ? ”
38942	38987	38988	38988	I	0	“ Not that part , but — the moving in and the practice kissing and the make - believe at being in love and even the fake planning a wedding . I mean , what if I never do any of that for real ? ”
38994	39032	38988	38988	I	0	“ I ’m not like you and Winnie . I ’ve never had guys knocking down my door . I ’ve had like three boyfriends ever , and none of them lasted more than a few months . ”
39033	39050	38850	38850	I	0	“ That ’s because you break up with anyone that says ‘ I love you . ’ ”
39051	39060	39061	39061	I	0	“ We ’re not talking about the past , ”
39065	39071	39061	39061	I	0	“ You brought it up . ”
39072	39104	38850	38850	I	0	“ What if it never happens for me , Millie ? What if it never feels right ? Why should n’t I get a chance to experience what it ’s like ? ”
39125	39134	39135	39135	Millie	83	“ Okay , okay . I ’m sorry , ”
39139	39161	39135	39135	Millie	83	“ As long as you ’re sure this is n’t going to end badly , I ’ll go along with it . ”
39162	39167	39168	39168	I	0	“ You have to . ”
39175	39197	39198	39198	She	83	“ You ca n’t tell anyone it ’s not real . Please . Just let us have this for a month . ”
39216	39238	39198	39198	She	83	“ I wo n’t say a word . Especially because I think it is real — part of it , anyway . ”
39239	39245	39246	39246	I	0	“ It ’s not real . ”
39260	39298	39246	39246	I	0	“ It ’s pretend and it ’s temporary and we ’re just having a good time . Now are you coming for dinner ? I ’m cooking at Hutton ’s house — I mean , our house . ”
39299	39314	39198	39198	She	83	“ I would n’t miss it . I just hope I remember my lines . ”
39315	39343	39363	39363	her	83	“ All you have to do is say you ’re going to help me plan a small wedding at the end of August . That ’s it . ”
39344	39356	39357	39357	she	83	“ Does n’t give those bangs much time to grow out , ”
39369	39373	39360	39360	I	0	“ Not funny . ”
39374	39387	39388	39388	she	83	“ It ’s actually not as bad as the photo you sent , ”
39391	39401	39388	39388	she	83	“ I ’m pretty sure you ’ve done worse . ”
39402	39405	39406	39406	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
39409	39413	39406	39406	I	0	“ I think . ”
39472	39477	39456	39456	He	862	“ Was it locked ? ”
39478	39484	39485	39485	I	0	“ I do n’t know , ”
39488	39505	39485	39485	I	0	“ But I did n’t just want to come in . I was going to knock . ”
39506	39528	39529	39529	He	862	“ Felicity , you live here now . You do n’t have to knock . I ’ll get you a key . ”
39540	39548	39529	39529	He	862	“ Can I help you with bags ? ”
39549	39554	39555	39555	I	0	“ This is it , ”
39561	39580	39581	39581	He	862	“ I did n’t pack up everything , since this is , you know , short - term . ”
39588	39597	39581	39581	He	862	“ Did you run into anyone at home ? ”
39598	39603	39604	39604	I	0	“ Yes . Millie . ”
39607	39615	39604	39604	I	0	“ And I have to confess something . ”
39616	39619	39581	39581	He	862	“ What ? ”
39620	39626	39627	39627	His	862	“ She knows the truth . ”
39631	39635	39627	39627	His	862	“ She does ? ”
39636	39679	39680	39680	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m sorry . She just knows me really well , and she can smell bullshit a mile away . I could n’t keep up the act . But do n’t worry , she ’s going along with it . ”
39683	39698	39680	39680	I	0	“ And unlike my younger sister Winnie , Millie can totally keep a secret . ”
39699	39707	39708	39708	He	862	“ Does she think we ’re crazy ? ”
39718	39724	39708	39708	He	862	“ Definitely . But she — ”
39774	39780	39770	39770	He	862	“ Is this room okay ? ”
39781	39785	39786	39786	I	0	“ Of course . ”
39793	39800	39786	39786	I	0	“ It ’s just . . . ”
39801	39804	39805	39805	He	862	“ What ? ”
39813	39851	39852	39852	He	862	“ It ’s just , what if someone asks to see the house tonight ? My family has never been here before . If they see all my stuff in a separate room , they might wonder . ”
39855	39860	39861	39861	He	862	“ You ’re right . ”
39875	39880	39861	39861	He	862	“ Is this better ? ”
39950	39957	39958	39958	He	862	“ It ’s a beautiful room . ”
39965	40014	39958	39958	He	862	“ If you just give me a minute , I ’ll clear out some drawers for you so you can unpack in here . There should be plenty of room in the closet too — it ’s huge . Sorry , I should have thought about this before . ”
40015	40022	40023	40023	He	862	“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
40036	40042	40023	40023	He	862	“ Is that enough space ? ”
40043	40046	40047	40047	He	862	“ Definitely . ”
40059	40071	40047	40047	He	862	“ I ’ll just store these in another bedroom for now . ”
40072	40075	40076	40076	I	0	“ Okay . ”
40085	40091	40076	40076	I	0	“ Is that the bathroom ? ”
40092	40111	40047	40047	He	862	“ Yes . There are clean towels in there too , if you want to take a shower . ”
40112	40115	40116	40116	He	862	“ Thanks . ”
40149	40154	40155	40155	I	0	“ Would you mind ? ”
40163	40177	40155	40155	I	0	“ It ’s hard for me to get this unzipped on my own . ”
40178	40183	40184	40184	He	862	“ Oh . Sure . ”
40322	40327	40312	40312	Hutton	151	“ Is that good ? ”
40328	40334	40312	40312	Hutton	151	“ Perfect . Thank you . ”
40335	40339	40343	40343	he	862	“ No problem . ”
40414	40422	40423	40423	Frannie	86	“ I just ca n’t believe it . ”
40483	40490	40474	40474	she	86	“ Jeez , Mom . Again ? ”
40509	40515	40506	40506	her	86	“ It ’s not sad . ”
40516	40524	40525	40525	Frannie	86	“ I know , but . . . ”
40538	40550	40534	40534	her	86	“ It ’s overwhelming , how happy I feel about it . ”
40551	40558	40572	40572	them	881	“ And how sudden it was , ”
40580	40589	40569	40569	I	0	“ It was sudden . I get it . ”
40590	40602	40604	40604	Winnie	89	“ But it ’s not like we did n’t all suspect , ”
40625	40636	40637	40637	she	89	“ You should have seen them back in high school , ”
40642	40656	40637	40637	she	89	“ It was obvious this was how it was going to turn out . ”
40657	40669	40670	40670	Dex	90	“ It ’s cool that you were friends for so long , ”
40673	40687	40670	40670	Dex	90	“ So how did you go from just friends to engaged so quickly ? ”
40691	40698	40688	40688	Winnie	89	“ Like when did it happen ? ”
40742	40745	40746	40746	I	0	“ Well , ”
40764	40827	40746	40746	I	0	“ you guys know we ’ve been close since we were twelve . And even when we ’d go for a while without seeing each other , we were always in touch . In March , when Hutton came home for a visit , we really reconnected . Then when he moved back in May , we started spending more time together . ”
40828	40838	40839	40839	Winnie	89	“ So it really was n’t sudden at all , ”
40845	40858	40839	40839	Winnie	89	“ You realized what you ’d been looking for was right there , ”
40867	40874	40875	40875	Audrey	88	“ Just like in a song , ”
40878	40883	40875	40875	Audrey	88	“ Or a movie . ”
40884	40889	40891	40891	Hallie	112	“ Or a storybook , ”
40893	40913	40891	40891	Hallie	112	“ Except not a fairy tale , because Felicity was n’t , like , a servant or a mermaid . ”
40914	40922	40924	40924	Luna	112	“ Or in a sleep like death , ”
40926	40933	40924	40924	Luna	112	“ Or stuck in a tower . ”
40934	40959	40960	40962	The two girls	886	“ Good thing , because she just chopped all her hair off . There would n’t have been anything for a prince to climb . ”
40975	40985	40986	40986	Dex	90	“ At least you got to be a prince , ”
40991	41005	40986	40986	Dex	90	“ When they put me in a story , I ’m an ogre . ”
41006	41016	41018	41018	Audrey	88	“ Are you going to have a big wedding ? ”
41020	41023	41024	41024	I	0	“ No , ”
41028	41049	41024	41024	I	0	“ We ’d like something very intimate at Cloverleigh Farms . Millie and I are working together on a date . ”
41064	41067	41068	41068	she	230	“ Yes , ”
41071	41078	41068	41068	she	230	“ We ’ll work it out . ”
41079	41090	41091	41091	Frannie	86	“ But Cloverleigh must be totally booked for the season , ”
41096	41108	41109	41109	Millie	83	“ On weekends , the barn is booked up , yes , ”
41112	41133	41109	41109	Millie	83	“ But since their event is small , we might be able to accommodate them somewhere else on the property . ”
41134	41148	41149	41149	Frannie	86	“ We could close down the bar and restaurant on a Sunday evening , ”
41152	41162	41149	41149	Frannie	86	“ We ’ve done that for private events before . ”
41163	41166	41168	41169	my dad	246	“ Sure , ”
41171	41183	41184	41184	I	0	“ We know this is last minute , and we apologize , ”
41190	41194	41184	41184	I	0	“ No need . ”
41239	41251	41252	41252	I	0	“ We ’ll make it work . Nothing is more important . ”
41256	41263	41264	41264	Winnie	89	“ Tell us about the proposal , ”
41267	41273	41264	41264	Winnie	89	“ It was very romantic . ”
41284	41304	41264	41264	Winnie	89	“ We were on a walk in the woods here , and he suddenly just dropped to one knee . ”
41305	41312	41313	41313	Frannie	86	“ Had you been planning it ? ”
41317	41324	41313	41313	Frannie	86	“ It was sort of spontaneous . ”
41346	41353	41337	41337	I	0	“ Did he have a ring ? ”
41359	41374	41375	41375	I	0	“ No , but we looked at photos online , and chose one together , ”
41378	41391	41375	41375	I	0	“ It ’s being sized and we ’ll pick it up soon . ”
41392	41404	41405	41405	Winnie	89	“ So you ’ve never even had it on your finger ? ”
41411	41427	41428	41428	I	0	“ It will be like getting engaged all over again when you put it on ! ”
41431	41437	41428	41428	I	0	“ I guess it will . ”
41438	41443	41444	41444	Frannie	86	“ Which jewelry store ? ”
41447	41454	41444	41444	Frannie	86	“ Is it one in town ? ”
41468	41471	41472	41472	Hutton	151	“ Tiffany . ”
41478	41500	41472	41472	Hutton	151	“ It ’s at Tiffany in New York . We ’re going to fly there this week and pick it up . ”
41501	41505	41506	41506	Winnie	89	“ You are ? ”
41509	41513	41506	41506	Winnie	89	“ We are ? ”
41519	41522	41523	41523	He	151	“ Yes . ”
41535	41538	41523	41523	He	151	“ Surprise . ”
41539	41542	41543	41543	Frannie	86	“ Oh . ”
41548	41554	41545	41545	her	86	“ Here I go again . ”
41657	41675	41651	41651	I	0	“ I ’m just going to get the dishes loaded , and then I ’ll come down . ”
41676	41690	41691	41691	She	83	“ I ’ll help you . I want to talk to you anyway . ”
41705	41714	41691	41691	She	83	“ Oh my God ! I ’m dying ! ”
41731	41740	41715	41715	I	0	“ Do you think we pulled it off ? ”
41741	41774	41694	41694	her	83	“ Definitely . Everyone was so excited because you guys have been friends for so long . I do n’t think they questioned it a bit — they want to believe it . ”
41775	41778	41779	41779	I	0	“ Good . ”
41786	41802	41779	41779	I	0	“ Although I do feel kind of bad about how happy Dad and Frannie are . ”
41803	41813	41814	41814	She	905	“ They are happy . But you know what ? ”
41832	41838	41814	41814	She	905	“ Hutton is happy too . ”
41839	41845	41779	41779	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
41846	41861	41862	41862	I	0	“ I mean he does not look at you like the feelings are fake . ”
41872	41884	41862	41862	I	0	“ They are n’t all fake . We ’re good friends . ”
41885	41892	41779	41779	I	0	“ You know what I mean . ”
41893	41901	41862	41862	I	0	“ How does he look at me ? ”
41908	41918	41919	41919	I	0	“ Like he ca n’t believe you ’re real . ”
41925	41929	41919	41919	I	0	“ Stop it . ”
41930	41974	41779	41779	I	0	“ I ’m serious . The guy has a thing for you . Why else would he agree to this crazy scheme ? Ask you to move in ? Fly you to Tiffany in New York next week to pick up a ring ? ”
41975	41985	41986	41986	I	0	“ I have no idea what that was about , ”
41990	42003	41986	41986	I	0	“ It was not part of the story we made up earlier . ”
42004	42010	42011	42011	She	905	“ That ’s my point . ”
42022	42031	42011	42011	She	905	“ Not all of this is made up . ”
42032	42047	42048	42048	I	0	“ Okay , maybe not all of it — there is an attraction there , ”
42072	42085	42060	42060	her	905	“ Speaking of which , what are the sleeping arrangements Chez French ? ”
42090	42154	42060	42060	her	905	“ I ’m not sure . At first , he put all my stuff in the guest room , but then we thought that would look suspicious , so we moved it into his bedroom . But I do n’t know what ’s going to happen tonight . Like , when it ’s time for bed , which room should I go in ? ”
42155	42164	42232	42234	EIGHT HUTTON Felicity	151	“ Do you want to sleep with him ? ”
42165	42188	42189	42189	Millie	83	“ Yes , but you ’re not supposed to want to bang your best friend or your fake fiancé , are you ? ”
42192	42219	42220	42220	She	83	“ I do n’t think there are any guidelines for this situation . You ’re going to have to make them up as you go along . ”
42227	42231	42220	42220	She	83	“ Have fun . ”
42247	42253	42232	42234	EIGHT HUTTON Felicity	151	“ So was it terrible ? ”
42254	42285	42286	42286	She	83	“ No . It was n’t terrible . Actually , your family talks so much that I did n’t really feel pressured to be on once we got through dinner . ”
42289	42310	42286	42286	She	83	“ We do talk a lot . And adding Dex ’s girls to the mix was another layer of chaos . ”
42311	42326	42232	42234	EIGHT HUTTON Felicity	151	“ It was fine . I ’m fucking exhausted , but it was fine . ”
42327	42336	42337	42337	she	83	“ Why do n’t you go to bed ? ”
42340	42347	42337	42337	she	83	“ I can finish cleaning up . ”
42348	42355	42356	42356	I	0	“ I ’m not physically exhausted , ”
42367	42417	42356	42356	I	0	“ It ’s just a lot of work for me to be around a group of people , even people I like . Takes a lot of energy beneath the surface to appear cool and collected on the outside when your insides feel like a bunch of live wires . ”
42421	42433	42418	42418	She	83	“ I bet . Thank you for doing that for me . ”
42434	42465	42337	42337	she	83	“ You ’re welcome . And you do n’t have to clean up . The housekeeper will be here in the morning , and she can take care of it . ”
42466	42483	42484	42484	she	83	“ I ’m just going to finish loading the dishwasher and take care of the pans , ”
42492	42505	42484	42484	she	83	“ I ’ve worked in too many restaurants to leave a mess . ”
42506	42511	42337	42337	she	83	“ Can I help ? ”
42512	42549	42550	42550	I	0	“ No . But you can keep me company and you can say it ’s okay to shoot some photos for my blog in here tomorrow . The light and surfaces are going to look amazing ! ”
42553	42567	42550	42550	I	0	“ Of course it ’s okay . This is your kitchen now too . ”
42574	42578	42568	42568	Her	83	“ Thank you . ”
42586	42602	42604	42604	she	83	“ So tell me more about your business plans . What ’s the ultimate goal ? ”
42644	42675	42676	42676	she	83	“ I love the combination of art and science that cooking takes , and I love the stories behind the places where ingredients come from — especially fruits and vegetables , ”
42681	42758	42676	42676	she	83	“ I know it ’s not super sexy , but I think growing up running around Cloverleigh Farms really showed me the love and pride and passion families have for growing good things . And there are all kinds of small farms like that , passing down family traditions and recipes and methods . I ’m fascinated by the human side of it . That ’s what I missed in the test kitchen . The stories . ”
42911	42923	42924	42924	she	83	“ I guess my ultimate goal would be to write cookbooks , ”
42927	42979	42924	42924	she	83	“ But I need to build a platform first in order for publishing houses to consider me . Unless you ’re already a celebrity , it ’s not easy to get a cookbook deal . You need something to make you stand out , a unique perspective , a fresh aesthetic . ”
42980	42997	42998	42998	She	83	“ I know some people in publishing . I could put you in touch with them . ”
43003	43085	42998	42998	She	83	“ Thanks , but I want to do it on my own . I had this all planned out when I moved back . Frannie sat down with me , and we sort of mapped out the steps I should take . First , get my blog up and running . Next , start my catering business . Then , once I had traction and a bigger following — and some income — I could write the proposal for the book . ”
43086	43091	43178	43178	Her	83	“ That makes sense . ”
43092	43103	43104	43104	She	83	“ I ’m still finding my voice , you know ? ”
43123	43145	43104	43104	She	83	“ I ’m still building confidence in myself and figuring out what I want to say and why people should listen . ”
43146	43153	43154	43154	I	0	“ I have faith in you , ”
43158	43173	43154	43154	I	0	“ You ’re smart and creative and intuitive . You ’ll find the angle . ”
43174	43177	43178	43178	Her	83	“ Thanks . ”
43183	43209	43178	43178	Her	83	“ I remember when I wanted to drop out of Brown and go to culinary school . Everyone told me I was crazy except you . ”
43210	43221	43154	43154	I	0	“ I wanted you to do what makes you happy . ”
43222	43254	43255	43255	She	83	“ I know . I appreciated that . Most people just brought up the money — didn’t I realize I ’d never make a doctor ’s salary working in a restaurant ? ”
43267	43273	43255	43255	She	83	“ Money is n’t everything . ”
43274	43278	43279	43279	She	83	“ I agree . ”
43287	43299	43279	43279	She	83	“ Um , that thing you said . About New York ? ”
43300	43305	43306	43306	I	0	“ Sorry about that . ”
43309	43330	43306	43306	I	0	“ As soon as it was out of my mouth , I realized I probably should have asked you first . ”
43331	43334	43335	43335	She	83	“ Hutton . ”
43342	43364	43339	43339	her	83	“ Stop apologizing to me . You never have to worry that I ’ll take things like that the wrong way . ”
43365	43374	43382	43382	she	83	“ Does that mean you want to go ? ”
43389	43395	43382	43382	she	83	“ Of course I do ! ”
43408	43422	43397	43397	she	83	“ But not to buy a ring , right ? Just for fun . ”
43423	43439	43382	43382	she	83	“ Do n’t you think we should get you a ring ? Everyone keeps asking . ”
43440	43454	43455	43455	She	83	“ Okay , but not a Tiffany ring . Something fake and cheap . ”
43470	43481	43455	43455	She	83	“ I mean it , Hutton . No expensive ring . ”
43482	43486	43382	43382	she	83	“ Why not ? ”
43487	43516	43517	43517	She	83	“ Because it ’s unnecessary . Let ’s just buy a decoy , okay ? An imitation diamond for our imitation engagement . That ’s all we need . ”
43522	43529	43519	43519	her	83	“ Do n’t waste your money . ”
43563	43566	43567	43567	She	83	“ Okay . ”
43571	43575	43567	43567	She	83	“ Thank you . ”
43576	43585	43519	43519	her	83	“ Does the trip work with your schedule ? ”
43586	43647	43567	43567	She	83	“ Well , I ’m on the schedule at Etoile Tuesday through Thursday , but not in the kitchen . I have to man the booth at the Cherry Festival . And I ’d say I could get someone to cover for me , but there ’s something kind of crazy going down Tuesday night that I ca n’t miss . ”
43648	43653	43659	43659	her	83	“ What is it ? ”
43662	43702	43703	43703	I	0	“ It ’s a proposal . Etoile ’s head chef , Gianni , is going to propose to his girlfriend , Ellie Fournier . She ’s the daughter of the Abelard owners . But you ca n’t tell anyone . ”
43706	43712	43703	43703	I	0	“ Who would I tell ? ”
43713	43764	43567	43567	She	83	“ Anyway , I ca n’t miss it . I think I ’m the only other person that knows what ’s going to happen and when , and I promised Gianni I ’d be there to make sure Ellie is where she ’s supposed to be at the right time . ”
43771	43788	43765	43765	She	912	“ But I might be able to get someone to cover for me Wednesday and Thursday . ”
43789	43797	43703	43703	I	0	“ Okay . You let me know . ”
43798	43822	43703	43703	I	0	“ I ’ll ask Gianni tomorrow , but it will be kind of short notice to plan a trip , wo n’t it ? ”
43823	43841	43765	43765	She	912	“ It ’s not a problem . I ’ll get us there and back whenever we want . ”
43842	43852	43703	43703	I	0	“ Do you own a private jet or something ? ”
43853	43867	43868	43868	She	912	“ No private jet . But it ’s easy enough to hire one . ”
43871	43878	43868	43868	She	912	“ Spoken like a true billionaire . ”
43904	43909	43898	43898	I	0	“ Ready for bed ? ”
43910	43913	43914	43914	I	0	“ Yes . ”
43918	43946	43914	43914	I	0	“ Go ahead . I ’m just going to make sure all the lights are off downstairs and the doors are locked before turning the alarm on . ”
43947	43951	43898	43898	I	0	“ Need help ? ”
43952	43959	43960	43960	My	0	“ No . I ’m good . ”
44443	44446	44447	44447	she	912	“ Hi , ”
44450	44453	44447	44447	she	912	“ Hey . ”
44454	44465	44466	44466	My	0	“ I was wondering if you wanted to practice now . ”

44486	44494	44447	44447	she	912	“ Should I get in your bed ? ”
44495	44498	44499	44499	She	912	“ Definitely . ”
44568	44572	44573	44573	She	912	“ Come here . ”
44619	44622	44623	44623	she	912	“ Oh , ”
44626	44631	44632	44632	She	912	“ Is this okay ? ”
44644	44651	44632	44632	She	912	“ It ’s more than okay . ”
44838	44847	44848	44848	I	0	“ Maybe we should discuss a few things , ”
44858	44862	44848	44848	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
44863	44875	44877	44877	my	0	“ Like what other things we should practice . For example . ”
44899	44908	44909	44909	She	912	“ I could practice touching you like this . ”
44978	44988	44966	44966	her	912	“ And I could practice touching you like this . ”
45046	45053	45038	45038	I	0	“ I could practice undressing you . ”
45054	45061	45062	45062	she	912	“ I definitely think you should , ”
45210	45214	45201	45201	She	912	“ My turn . ”
45380	45383	45384	45384	she	912	“ Hutton , ”
45390	45399	45384	45384	she	912	“ You should practice taking off my underwear . ”
45438	45444	45429	45429	She	912	“ What are you doing ? ”
45445	45450	45451	45451	I	0	“ Is this okay ? ”
45466	45470	45451	45451	I	0	“ I guess . ”
45475	45487	45471	45471	She	912	“ You can tell me to stop , and I will . ”
45522	45527	45528	45528	she	912	“ Do n’t stop , ”
45541	45545	45531	45531	I	0	“ Never stop . ”
45546	45555	45579	45579	her	912	“ You taste even better than I imagined . ”
45556	45562	45563	45563	Her	912	“ You ’ve imagined this ? ”
45569	45573	45563	45563	Her	912	“ Oh yeah . ”
45604	45617	45574	45574	I	0	“ I ’ve played this movie in my mind a thousand times . ”
45618	45621	45622	45622	She	912	“ You — ”
45627	45633	45622	45622	She	912	“ You never said anything . ”
45657	45668	45651	45651	Her	912	“ Not the thing you tell someone during calculus review . ”
45674	45680	45669	45669	I	0	“ Or in a text . ”
45697	45705	45706	45706	She	912	“ Or at the hospital emergency room . ”
45709	45719	45706	45706	She	912	“ God , do n’t remind me about that . ”
45729	45744	45706	45706	She	912	“ It all worked out . I ’m exactly where I want to be . ”
45745	45749	45750	45750	she	912	“ Me too , ”
45760	45771	45750	45750	she	912	“ I ’m exactly where I want to be too . ”
45815	45832	45799	45799	I	0	“ Your tongue — oh God — you’re amazing . I can’t — I ca n’t — ”
45903	45909	45910	45910	she	912	“ It ’s too much , ”
45913	45919	45910	45910	she	912	“ You have to stop . ”
45940	45945	45922	45922	I	0	“ I can stop . ”
45946	45965	45966	45966	She	912	“ I do n’t mean stop forever , just maybe for a second , so I can breathe . ”
45974	45982	45968	45968	her	912	“ But practice is n’t over yet . ”
45983	45986	45987	45987	She	912	“ No ? ”
45992	46005	45989	45989	her	912	“ I think there are several more things we should work on . ”
46006	46013	45968	45968	her	912	“ I ’m open to suggestions . ”
46014	46023	46024	46024	I	0	“ I thought you enjoyed being in control . ”
46027	46032	46024	46024	I	0	“ That ’s true . ”
46033	46039	46040	46040	she	912	“ I ’m not scared , ”
46043	46054	46040	46040	she	912	“ I trust you . Tell me what you like . ”
46089	46094	46085	46085	she	912	“ Do n’t move . ”
46120	46123	46124	46124	She	912	“ Wait . ”
46128	46137	46124	46124	She	912	“ I think I should practice this part . ”
46227	46233	46212	46212	she	912	“ How did I do ? ”
46234	46239	46212	46212	she	912	“ A perfect ten . ”
46253	46265	46242	46242	I	0	“ But this next part is critical . Timing is everything . ”
46266	46272	46273	46273	she	912	“ Could not agree more , ”
46329	46336	46321	46321	I	0	“ You feel so fucking good . ”
46337	46340	46341	46341	she	912	“ Hutton , ”
46359	46366	46341	46341	she	912	“ This ca n’t be real . ”
46763	46771	46752	46752	she	912	“ That was . . . wow . ”
46772	46787	46814	46814	Her	912	“ Yeah . We probably got in a little more practice than we needed . ”
46788	46803	46814	46814	Her	912	“ No , I think it was good . Practice makes perfect , right ? ”
46804	46813	46814	46814	Her	912	“ That was pretty fucking close to perfect . ”
46856	46868	46869	46869	Her	912	“ I was n’t sure if I should come in here . ”
46877	46880	46869	46869	Her	912	“ Seriously ? ”
46907	46927	46894	46894	I	0	“ Yeah . I could not make up my mind about whether you wanted me like this or not . ”
46928	46932	46933	46933	She	912	“ Convinced now ? ”
46936	46939	46933	46933	She	912	“ Mmhm . ”
46940	46943	46944	46944	I	0	“ Good . ”
46949	47008	46944	46944	I	0	“ I even came in here while you were downstairs turning off the lights to steal a shirt . That was going to be my excuse if you caught me in your bedroom , and then I was going to attempt to seduce you . But you took so long coming back up that I lost my nerve . ”
47019	47073	47009	47009	I	0	“ Sorry . I was trying to give you enough time to make the choice on your own about which bedroom to sleep in . I was hoping you ’d choose mine , but I did n’t want to pressure you . But please tell me you ’ll attempt to seduce me again . ”
47077	47088	47074	47074	She	935	“ Maybe . You ’ll have to wait and see . ”
47089	47102	47127	47127	Her	935	“ This is definitely a side of you I ’ve never seen . ”
47103	47126	47127	47127	Her	935	“ There ’s a reason for that . We ’ve always been such good friends . I mean , we still are . ”
47134	47137	47127	47127	Her	935	“ Right ? ”
47138	47144	47145	47145	I	0	“ Of course we are . ”
47153	47167	47145	47145	I	0	“ In fact , I ’m really glad to hear you say that . ”
47168	47171	47127	47127	Her	935	“ Why ? ”
47172	47180	47145	47145	I	0	“ I ca n’t promise anything more . ”
47181	47188	47145	47145	I	0	“ Because you suck at relationships ? ”
47189	47192	47193	47193	I	0	“ Hey . ”
47205	47211	47212	47212	she	935	“ Sorry — couldn’t resist , ”
47215	47240	47212	47212	she	935	“ But do n’t worry , I ca n’t promise anything more either . To be perfectly honest , I suck at relationships too . ”
47241	47248	47145	47145	I	0	“ I do n’t believe that . ”
47249	47289	47193	47193	I	0	“ Believe it . I mean , I ’ve never dated a Zlatka , so no one has ever told me that to my face , but my sister Millie said something today that hit pretty close to home . ”
47290	47296	47297	47297	Felicity	151	“ What did she say ? ”
47305	47335	47297	47297	Felicity	151	“ She said the reason I ’ve never had a successful long - term relationship is because I break up with anyone who says ‘ I love you . ’ ”
47336	47341	47193	47193	I	0	“ Is that true ? ”
47342	47347	47297	47297	Felicity	151	“ One hundred percent . ”
47363	47369	47357	47357	her	936	“ And why is that ? ”
47377	47416	47370	47370	She	936	“ I do n’t really know . I ’ve just always been that way . I suppose I figure things are going to blow up at some point anyway , so I might as well light the match . ”
47497	47508	47509	47509	I	0	“ Well , I think Zlatka is into women too , ”
47513	47573	47509	47509	I	0	“ so if you ’d like to date her , I ’m sure she ’d be glad to tell you exactly why you suck at relationships . Although , she ’s not likely to tell you she loves you — at least , she never said that to me — so maybe things would work out with you guys . ”
47581	47600	47576	47576	she	238	“ No , thanks . I do n’t need Zlatka in my life pointing out all my flaws . ”
47601	47607	47576	47576	she	238	“ You have no flaws . ”
47608	47629	47576	47576	she	238	“ Ha ! I ’ve got plenty . But I ’m actually sort of glad for one of them tonight . ”
47630	47634	47576	47576	she	238	“ Oh yeah ? ”
47635	47671	47672	47672	My	0	“ Yes , if I had better impulse control , I might not have told Mimi we were engaged , and then I would not have just experienced the best two orgasms of my life . ”
47685	47697	47679	47679	She	238	“ Tell me something about yourself that I do n’t know . ”
47698	47702	47576	47576	she	238	“ Like what ? ”
47703	47710	47711	47711	I	0	“ Something from before we met . ”
47717	47733	47711	47711	I	0	“ When I was a kid , I wanted to be a professional baseball player . ”
47734	47747	47576	47576	she	238	“ You did ? I did n’t even know you played baseball . ”
47748	47758	47576	47576	she	238	“ I quit right before we moved up here . ”
47759	47762	47711	47711	I	0	“ Why ? ”
47763	47786	47576	47576	she	238	“ I had a really bad game . Struck out three times in a row and cost my team the league championship . ”
47803	47806	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ Oh . ”
47812	47823	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ I ’m sorry . That had to feel terrible . ”
47824	47857	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ It did . I never played again . But it ’s not like I was going to play professionally anyway . I was talented , but I was n’t that good . ”
47858	47880	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ Well , I ’m glad you told me . The childhood baseball dream seems like something a fiancée would know . ”
47881	47894	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ What did you want to be when you were a kid ? ”
47895	47930	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ A hundred different things . A scientist . An astronaut . A pastry chef . A school librarian . I thought it would be cool to spend my days around kids and books . ”
47931	47942	47807	47807	Felicity	151	“ You ’d be great at that , Miss MacAllister . ”
47953	47961	47962	47962	She	943	“ Would you be a naughty librarian ? ”
47965	47981	47962	47962	She	943	“ Only for you . Hey , this is what we should do every night . ”
47997	48004	47982	47982	I	0	“ I could not agree more . ”
48005	48012	48013	48013	she	943	“ I do n’t mean that , ”
48018	48054	48013	48013	she	943	“ I mean — yes , that too — but what I meant was that every night we should tell each other one secret . So that we know each other better than anybody else . ”
48055	48065	47982	47982	I	0	“ You already know me better than anybody else . ”
48066	48070	48071	48071	she	943	“ I do ? ”
48078	48083	48074	48074	her	943	“ Are you surprised ? ”
48084	48114	47982	47982	I	0	“ Kind of . I mean , I know we ’re close now , and we were close then , but there were a lot of years in between . ”
48139	48158	48159	48159	She	943	“ Does n’t matter . I ’ve never been close with anyone the way I am with you . ”
48167	48182	48161	48161	her	943	“ Are you saying that right now because you want to have more sex ? ”
48183	48186	48187	48187	I	0	“ Yes . ”
48192	48227	48187	48187	I	0	“ But I also mean it . What looks like a six to you might appear as a nine to me . It ’s just a different perspective . Both things can be true . ”
48228	48236	48237	48237	she	943	“ You ’re such a math nerd , ”
48240	48250	48237	48237	she	943	“ I also like the numbers six and nine . ”
48262	48271	48251	48251	She	943	“ I suppose both things can be true . ”
48557	48560	48549	48549	Hutton	151	“ Hey . ”
48561	48564	48565	48565	I	0	“ Hi . ”
48579	48583	48565	48565	I	0	“ Heading out ? ”
48584	48593	48594	48594	I	0	“ Yeah . Want to come with me ? ”
48635	48651	48619	48619	I	0	“ Nah , you go ahead . I might take a jog later or something . ”
48652	48655	48656	48656	He	151	“ Okay . ”
48667	48706	48707	48707	I	0	“ The housekeeper will be here in about an hour . I texted her that I had a guest staying with me , so she would n’t be caught off guard by the naked girl in my bed . ”
48710	48730	48707	48707	I	0	“ Thanks , but I ’m getting up in a minute here . I need to go into work . ”
48731	48739	48619	48619	I	0	“ Is n’t the restaurant closed Mondays ? ”
48740	48799	48707	48707	I	0	“ Yes , but I have to check in with Gianni — I want to go over details for tomorrow night ’s proposal and ask him about getting Wednesday or Thursday off . After that , I was thinking of making a few dishes and taking some photos in your kitchen . Will you be around for dinner ? ”
48800	48808	48707	48707	I	0	“ You ’re cooking ? Fuck yes . ”
48809	48812	48813	48813	I	0	“ Great . ”
48816	48835	48813	48813	I	0	“ Say hi to the Prancin ’ Grannies for me . Will they be heartbroken about your engagement ? ”
48836	48851	48707	48707	I	0	“ Probably . But maybe they ’ll stop bugging me about their granddaughters now . ”
48852	48856	48857	48857	He	952	“ Good luck . ”
49023	49031	49032	49032	I	0	“ Good morning , future Mrs. French . ”
49035	49041	49032	49032	I	0	“ Morning . You busy ? ”
49042	49051	49052	49052	She	89	“ Not too bad . Come on in . ”
49061	49075	49052	49052	She	89	“ What ’s up ? You ’re not working today , are you ? ”
49076	49080	49052	49052	She	89	“ Not officially . ”
49088	49104	49105	49105	I	0	“ But I need to check with Gianni on a couple things for this week . ”
49141	49161	49128	49128	Gianni	152	“ Like taking some days off to go to New York on a shopping spree with your billionaire boyfriend ? ”
49162	49170	49171	49171	I	0	“ It ’s not a shopping spree , ”
49178	49187	49171	49171	I	0	“ We ’re just picking up the ring . ”
49188	49194	49195	49195	She	89	“ Where will you stay ? ”
49206	49216	49195	49195	She	89	“ The Ritz ? The Carlyle ? The Pierre ? ”
49217	49223	49224	49224	I	0	“ I ’m not sure , ”
49234	49246	49247	49247	Her	89	“ But we ’re chartering a private jet to fly there . ”
49251	49263	49247	49247	Her	89	“ Stop it ! Are n’t you high - falutin ’ ? ”
49264	49281	49195	49195	She	89	“ Listen , Hutton works hard . He ’s earned the right to falute a little . ”
49282	49322	49247	49247	Her	89	“ I agree one hundred percent , and I look forward to faluting vicariously through you . But hey , if you stay at The Pierre , steal one of the bathroom robes for me . They ’re glorious . ”
49330	49358	49325	49325	I	0	“ I will not be stealing any bathrobes . Anyway , I wanted to make sure you can still help out in the Etoile booth tomorrow night . ”
49359	49371	49195	49195	She	89	“ Yes . I ’ll be there . Six , right ? ”
49372	49404	49405	49405	I	0	“ Perfect . The second thing is , I wondered if you might help me sift through some of these messages I ’m getting from companies wanting to collaborate with me . ”
49424	49468	49405	49405	I	0	“ My follower count and inbox have gone bananas , I have no idea if any of these people are legit , and it feels kind of icky that all I did was get engaged to Hutton and now I ’m insanely popular . ”
49469	49478	49479	49479	She	960	“ I ’d be glad to help you . ”
49490	49510	49479	49479	She	960	“ But you do n’t have to say yes to any of them if you do n’t want to . ”
49511	49568	49569	49569	She	960	“ Half the companies reaching out to me have nothing to do with food . It ’s like clothes or cosmetics or hair products . Can you imagine ? Me , recommending hair products ? I ’m even fielding requests regarding my wedding day . Someone wants to send me a case of self - tanner ! ”
49572	49577	49569	49569	She	960	“ So say no . ”
49578	49602	49479	49479	She	960	“ But is that stupid ? What if it helps my business ? I wo n’t get a book deal without a platform . ”
49603	49692	49693	49693	I	0	“ I get that . But ideally , you want to build an audience of people who would be interested in what you do , what you say , and who ’d eventually buy your book . Recommending a self - tanner might earn you a little extra cash , but it probably wo n’t build your audience . A better use of your time would probably be concentrating on putting out more content . And it ’s not like you need the extra cash for rent anymore . ”
49699	49711	49693	49693	I	0	“ Right . I am going to put out more content . ”
49712	49744	49773	49773	Etoile	28	“ Good . So if it does n’t feel right to say yes to those offers , do n’t . But of course I can help you sort through it all . ”
49745	49764	49765	49765	I	0	“ Thanks . I ’m going to head over to see Gianni and then I ’ll be back . ”
49785	49788	49789	49789	I	0	“ Morning , ”
49792	49795	49789	49789	I	0	“ Morning . ”
49803	49812	49796	49796	He	152	“ Coffee ’s hot if you want some . ”
49813	49816	49817	49817	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
49823	49830	49817	49817	I	0	“ All set for tomorrow night ? ”
49831	49836	49837	49837	He	152	“ I think so . ”
49846	49858	49859	49859	I	0	“ She ’s going to be so fucking mad at me . ”
49862	49869	49859	49859	I	0	“ She ’ll still say yes . ”
49942	49951	49952	49952	he	152	“ Just do n’t forget the final prop , ”
49955	49975	49952	49952	he	152	“ Once she ’s wearing the ring , I need to throw a whipped cream pie in her face . ”
49984	49997	49980	49980	I	0	“ I really can not wait to see this proposal go down . ”
49998	50003	50004	50004	He	152	“ Speaking of proposals . ”
50009	50028	50006	50006	his	152	“ What ’s this I hear about you being secretly engaged ? Ellie was losing her mind yesterday . ”
50029	50034	50035	50035	My	0	“ Oh . Yeah . ”
50048	50051	50041	50041	I	0	“ Surprise . ”
50052	50067	50006	50006	his	152	“ I ca n’t believe you never said anything . When ’s the wedding ? ”
50068	50077	50078	50078	Gianni	152	“ Um , we ’re thinking next month . ”
50084	50091	50092	50092	He	152	“ Wow . That ’s fast . ”
50098	50104	50092	50092	He	152	“ Is there a reason ? ”
50105	50112	50113	50113	I	0	“ Not that kind of reason , ”
50117	50132	50113	50113	I	0	“ We just . . . do n’t want to wait , I guess . ”
50133	50145	50146	50146	he	152	“ Do n’t let anybody make you feel bad about that , ”
50156	50229	50146	50146	he	152	“ People always think they know how everyone else should live their lives and make their choices , because that ’s the way they did it . But it ’s bullshit . There ’s no one right way to do things — it ’s all right in the end , as long as it gets you where you want to go . The journey looks different for everybody , and it should . ”
50230	50233	50234	50234	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
50252	50257	50234	50234	I	0	“ I appreciate that . ”
50258	50283	50146	50146	he	152	“ And Ellie mentioned you guys have been good friends for a lot of years , so maybe it was n’t that sudden anyway . ”
50284	50291	50292	50292	I	0	“ It was slow and sudden . ”
50295	50302	50292	50292	I	0	“ Both things can be true . ”
50388	50399	50376	50376	Winnie	89	“ You think so ? That ’s what Millie said . ”
50400	50404	50405	50405	she	89	“ I would , ”
50411	50455	50405	50405	she	89	“ Show potential clients that you honestly care . Because the biggest priority is getting more reviews , and to get those , you need more business . I think you could do it in a way that shows your professionalism and character . ”
50506	50509	50511	50511	Winnie	89	“ Perfect , ”
50513	50518	50519	50519	I	0	“ I should go , ”
50526	50559	50519	50519	I	0	“ I need to hit the market on my way home . I want to try a few new recipes and take some photos while the light is good in the kitchen . ”
50560	50572	50573	50573	Winnie	89	“ Let me know when those companies get back to you , ”
50581	50590	50573	50573	Winnie	89	“ I think you made the right choices . ”
50599	50605	50573	50573	Winnie	89	“ Thanks for the help . ”
50606	50612	50613	50613	she	89	“ So I was wondering , ”
50623	50639	50613	50613	she	89	“ do you have plans for the last Saturday evening in July ? The 30th ? ”
50665	50675	50658	50658	she	89	“ Not that I ’m aware of . Why ? ”
50676	50683	50684	50684	she	89	“ No reason . No reason , ”
50731	50739	50740	50740	She	89	“ Winnie . Do you know something ? ”
50760	50776	50750	50750	her	89	“ For heaven ’s sake , Win . You know something . Out with it . ”
50777	50786	50787	50787	she	89	“ But I promised I would n’t telllllll , ”
50796	50806	50787	50787	she	89	“ You know you ca n’t keep a secret . ”
50824	50827	50828	50828	She	89	“ Winifred . ”
50844	50851	50839	50839	I	0	“ Fine . I ’m leaving . ”
50860	50878	50852	50852	Her	89	“ If I tell you , you have to promise me that you wo n’t say anything . ”
50879	50882	50883	50883	She	89	“ Okay . ”
50891	50910	50883	50883	She	89	“ So while you were in the kitchen , I got a phone call from Hutton ’s mom . ”
50921	50924	50911	50911	I	0	“ And ? ”
50925	50943	50944	50944	I	0	“ She wants to plan a surprise outdoor engagement party for you guys here on the patio . ”
50947	50954	50944	50944	I	0	“ Shoot ! On the 30th ? ”
50955	50997	50911	50911	I	0	“ Yes . The crazy thing was , that date was booked right up until this morning ! Literally , the event that was scheduled got canceled like ten minutes before she called . It was some kind of weird kismet . ”
50998	51006	50944	50944	I	0	“ I bet Mrs. French loved that . ”
51010	51049	51007	51007	Winnie	89	“ She did ! I have n’t confirmed with her yet — but I feel weird going along with it because I know Hutton does n’t love parties . Although you ’d think his mom would know that . ”
51050	51054	51055	51055	I	0	“ She knows . ”
51058	51067	51055	51055	I	0	“ So will he be okay with it ? ”
51068	51093	51007	51007	Winnie	89	“ Are you kidding ? He hates parties when he is n’t the center of attention . This one will be torture for him . ”
51094	51113	51055	51055	I	0	“ So should I make something up ? Tell her that other event was n’t canceled after all ? ”
51118	51127	51114	51114	She	89	“ I could get in trouble for that . ”
51128	51152	51153	51153	I	0	“ No , do n’t . She could easily go somewhere else , and then we ’ll have no control or inside information . ”
51162	51176	51153	51153	I	0	“ Go ahead and tell her yes . We ’ll get through it . ”
51177	51182	51153	51153	I	0	“ You ’re sure ? ”
51183	51200	51201	51201	I	0	“ I ’m sure . But I ’m not going to let it be a surprise , ”
51205	51212	51201	51201	I	0	“ I have to tell him . ”
51213	51222	51223	51223	Winnie	89	“ Will he go right to his mom ? ”
51228	51240	51223	51223	Winnie	89	“ She made me swear I ’d keep it a secret . ”
51241	51251	51252	51252	I	0	“ She obviously does n’t know you very well , ”
51258	51269	51252	51252	I	0	“ But I ’ll make sure Hutton understands the situation . ”
51270	51273	51223	51223	Winnie	89	“ Thanks . ”
51285	51298	51276	51276	she	89	“ It ’s going to be a beautiful party , I promise . ”
51299	51304	51305	51305	I	0	“ Keep it small , ”
51308	51311	51305	51305	I	0	“ Intimate . ”
51312	51344	51276	51276	she	89	“ I told her the max the patio can accommodate is thirty . And Etoile is also open that night , so the kitchen ca n’t handle too much more food . ”
51345	51354	51305	51305	I	0	“ Thirty is perfect . Keep me posted . ”
51371	51379	51380	51380	he	151	“ You know I hate the phone , ”
51387	51399	51380	51380	he	151	“ I do . But I ca n’t text and drive . ”
51400	51411	51276	51276	she	89	“ Never do that . Did you talk to Gianni ? ”
51412	51439	51365	51365	I	0	“ Yes , and he said it ’s not a problem . I can take Wednesday and Thursday night off . Ellie will cover for me . ”
51440	51449	51380	51380	he	151	“ Good . I ’ll book the trip . ”
51450	51453	51454	51454	My	0	“ Yay ! ”
51460	51484	51485	51485	I	0	“ I ’m heading to the market , and I was wondering if there was anything in particular you ’d like for dinner , ”
51505	51513	51485	51485	I	0	“ Does it have to be vegetarian ? ”
51514	51522	51485	51485	I	0	“ Nope . I can do anything . ”
51523	51526	51527	51527	I	0	“ Steak . ”
51530	51535	51527	51527	I	0	“ Of course steak . ”
51536	51543	51485	51485	I	0	“ Hey , you said anything . ”
51544	51556	51557	51557	I	0	“ I did , and I will cook you a steak , ”
51563	51605	51557	51557	I	0	“ It ’s not that I do n’t think they ’re delicious — I know they are . I just do n’t feel great after I eat meat , so I stick to other things . How ’s your day going ? ”
51606	51637	51485	51485	I	0	“ Fine , although I have a call scheduled later this afternoon with Wade that I ’m not looking forward to , and not just because I hate the phone . ”
51638	51644	51485	51485	I	0	“ Is it about testifying ? ”
51645	51671	51557	51557	I	0	“ Yes . He says he has more details about what questions I ’ll have to answer . He ’s in touch with committee members . ”
51672	51701	51702	51702	I	0	“ Well , more details are good , right ? The better prepared you can be , the more confident you ’ll feel . How was your run ? ”
51708	51717	51702	51702	I	0	“ Did you see the Prancin ’ Grannies ? ”
51718	51762	51763	51763	I	0	“ Yes . They tried to accost me the minute I got out of my car . I had my earbuds in , so I pretended I did n’t hear them and just started running . They could n’t keep up with me . ”
51766	51780	51763	51763	I	0	“ Poor grannies . They just want your attention for a few minutes . ”
51781	51822	51823	51823	I	0	“ They ’re vicious . You do n’t know them . In fact , now that they think we ’re engaged , they ’re probably going to come after you . Better watch your back for those pink bedazzled shirts . ”
51838	51846	51823	51823	I	0	“ I ’ll be on my guard . ”
52267	52271	52255	52255	Hutton	151	“ Want one ? ”
52272	52289	52290	52290	He	151	“ No , thanks . But maybe you could open that bottle of Valpolicella for me ? ”
52300	52309	52290	52290	He	151	“ Anything else I can do to help ? ”
52310	52318	52319	52319	I	0	“ Nope . Just keep me company . ”
52334	52346	52347	52347	He	151	“ Have a beer and a snack and hear me out . ”
52360	52369	52347	52347	He	151	“ Hear you out ? That sounds ominous . ”
52370	52374	52375	52375	I	0	“ Not really . ”
52383	52395	52375	52375	I	0	“ I just want to tell you about a little party . ”
52402	52406	52375	52375	I	0	“ What party ? ”
52407	52429	52442	52442	he	151	“ The surprise party your mom is throwing for us on the patio at Abelard Vineyards the last Saturday in July . ”
52448	52453	52445	52445	his	151	“ No fucking way . ”
52454	52461	52462	52462	I	0	“ The patio is really lovely , ”
52478	52481	52462	52462	I	0	“ No . ”
52482	52505	52445	52445	his	151	“ And the best part is , capacity on the patio is limited to thirty , so it has to be small . ”
52512	52532	52445	52445	his	151	“ It ’s not the patio I ’m objecting to . It ’s the surprise . Also the party . ”
52533	52599	52600	52600	I	0	“ But Hutton , we ’re not even supposed to know about it — at least if Winnie plans it at Abelard , we ’ll have all the details in advance . We ’ll know the terrain , the menu , the timeline — all the relevant details . Even if Winnie pretended Abelard had no available dates , your mom would not give up , ”
52608	52625	52600	52600	I	0	“ She ’ll go somewhere else and we ’ll have no clue when it ’s coming . ”
52642	52652	52653	52653	I	0	“ Our families are happy for us , Hutton . ”
52658	52677	52653	52653	I	0	“ People want to celebrate . We know it ’s not really happening , but they do n’t . ”
52678	52697	52698	52698	He	151	“ I know , but . . . a party ? That was not part of my plan . ”
52703	52722	52698	52698	He	151	“ This engagement was supposed to get people off my back , not invite them to pile on . ”
52723	52731	52732	52732	He	151	“ I know . I ’m sorry . ”
52745	52750	52732	52732	He	151	“ When is it ? ”
52751	52755	52698	52698	He	151	“ July 30th . ”
52756	52763	52698	52698	He	151	“ Two days after my testimony . ”
52764	52775	52776	52776	I	0	“ I realized that after Winnie told me the date , ”
52787	52811	52776	52776	I	0	“ I know the timing stinks , but that was the one day Abelard could fit us in . They had a cancellation . ”
52826	52840	52812	52812	He	151	“ You ’re right . My mother is not going to drop it . ”
52841	52852	52853	52853	He	151	“ We ’re not even supposed to know about it . ”
52864	52871	52853	52853	He	151	“ Do you want this party ? ”
52885	52908	52872	52872	I	0	“ It might be kind of fun . But I feel bad that your parents are going to spend money on it . ”
52909	52952	52812	52812	He	151	“ Listen , my mother has been trying to throw me a party since I was twelve and I ’ve said no every time . No birthday parties , no graduation parties , nothing . She will not care about the cost . ”
52953	52960	52872	52872	I	0	“ So is that a yes ? ”
52961	52968	52969	52969	I	0	“ Do I have a choice ? ”
52972	52996	52969	52969	I	0	“ Not really . Unless you want to call the engagement off before you go to D.C. End things sooner rather than later . ”
52997	53000	53001	53001	he	151	“ No , ”
53005	53021	53001	53001	he	151	“ I can deal with the party . Let ’s stick to the original plan . ”
53067	53075	53054	53054	We	994	“ It ’s like the old days . ”
53084	53094	53076	53076	I	0	“ Sitting here working next to you like this . ”
53095	53100	53101	53101	he	151	“ It ’s better , ”
53131	53135	53112	53112	I	0	“ How so ? ”
53136	53183	53184	53184	He	151	“ Well , I used to sit next to you and wonder what it would be like to kiss you . I ’d come up with all these crazy ways I could make it happen , then talk myself out of every single one of them . ”
53189	53219	53186	53186	his	151	“ I ’d think up tons of things I wanted to say to you — I’d even practice my lines — but never actually be able to say them . ”
53223	53239	53220	53220	I	0	“ Do you remember what you said to me after we danced at the prom ? ”
53244	53250	53220	53220	I	0	“ Do n’t tell me . ”
53251	53269	53270	53270	He	151	“ You said , ‘ That was n’t as bad as I thought it would be . ’ ”
53273	53310	53270	53270	He	151	“ That is not what I rehearsed . I totally chickened out . Sort of like I did at your bedroom door Saturday night instead of telling you the real reason I was about to knock . ”
53320	53352	53315	53315	my	0	“ You mean you were n’t really coming to my room with no shirt on to see if I was thirsty ? I ’m aghast ! You had me totally fooled ! ”

53534	53554	53525	53525	I	0	“ Compromise — how about you give me ten quick minutes in the shower and then you join me ? ”
53555	53559	53560	53560	He	151	“ Five minutes . ”
53571	53574	53560	53560	He	151	“ Go . ”

53961	53997	53998	53998	I	0	“ I ’m not saying it wo n’t be a tight squeeze , but I ’m sure two people as skilled in geometry as we are can come up with a solution to this problem . ”
54007	54048	54049	54049	I	0	“ For example , you can lie on your back and I ’ll lie on top of you — a parallelogram . Or you can sit , and I ’ll straddle your lap — more of a trapezoid . Or , ”

55700	55729	55682	55682	she	1010	“ I thought I could control the outcome of things — favorably for me , of course — or prevent bad things from happening , with certain actions . ”
55730	55736	55682	55682	she	1010	“ What would you do ? ”
55737	55771	55682	55682	she	1010	“ Small rituals like always putting my right sock on first , always sitting on the right side of the car , touching my nose as I entered a room , counting things . ”
55772	55778	55779	55779	She	1010	“ Did you have OCD ? ”
55795	55826	55791	55791	she	1010	“ I do n’t know . If I ’d been evaluated back then , they might have diagnosed me that way , but I never told anyone about my powers . ”
55827	55831	55682	55682	she	1010	“ Why not ? ”
55832	55840	55779	55779	She	1010	“ Because then they would n’t work . ”
55841	55844	55845	55845	Her	1010	“ Ah . ”
55854	55863	55845	55845	Her	1010	“ When did you stop believing in them ? ”
55874	55880	55881	55881	Her	1010	“ When my grandfather died . ”
55886	55892	55881	55881	Her	1010	“ How old were you ? ”
55893	55896	55897	55897	She	1010	“ Eleven . ”
55909	55923	55897	55897	She	1010	“ Is this the grandpa that gave you the signed Ray Bradbury paperbacks ? ”
55930	55933	55927	55927	she	1010	“ Yes . ”
55934	55946	55947	55947	My	0	“ Tell me more about him . What was he like ? ”
55964	56018	55960	55960	I	0	“ He loved puzzles , and we used to work on them together all the time . He loved baseball and never missed one of my games . He wore Pinaud Clubman aftershave , and sometimes I catch a whiff of it in a crowd and it ’s like he ’s right there . ”
56019	56024	55927	55927	she	1010	“ Maybe he is . ”
56025	56033	56034	56034	She	1010	“ Now you sound like my mother . ”
56037	56048	56034	56034	She	1010	“ Do you still have the books he gave you ? ”
56049	56082	55927	55927	she	1010	“ Yes . They ’re not in pristine condition or anything — he read them over and over again , and I did too — but I ’d never sell them anyway . ”
56083	56095	56034	56034	She	1010	“ Of course not . That kind of thing is priceless . ”
56103	56113	56096	56096	She	1010	“ I ’m sorry you lost him so young . ”
56114	56155	55927	55927	she	1010	“ His death hit me hard . It was n’t sudden — we knew he was sick — but I was so sure of my ability to prevent anything terrible from happening that I was totally unprepared when it happened . ”
56156	56162	55927	55927	she	1010	“ Did you blame yourself ? ”
56167	56228	56163	56163	she	1010	“ Not exactly , but I started to doubt myself in every way . Soon after that was when I struck out three times during my baseball team ’s championship game . I remember thinking then that it was clear — I was n’t magical . I was n’t even that special or talented . And everyone fucking knew it . ”
56248	56304	56242	56242	her	1010	“ I remember coming home and lying on my bed , just staring at the ceiling and thinking , I ’m not who I thought I was . The world did n’t work like I thought it did . And maybe everyone else had known this all along , and I was just an idiot . ”
56310	56374	56305	56305	She	1010	“ We moved right after that . My parents wanted a change of scene , and I think they even thought it would be good for me . They could see something was off . I ’d gone from a cocky , smart - mouthed fifth grader who only came home to eat and sleep into a kid who hated leaving the house . ”
56378	56399	56375	56375	I	0	“ But I think the move made it harder . I had to start over — without my magic powers . ”
56400	56407	56408	56408	she	1010	“ But then you met me , ”
56412	56422	56408	56408	she	1010	“ And that was a good thing , right ? ”
56423	56430	56375	56375	I	0	“ That was a good thing . ”
56431	56450	56375	56375	I	0	“ Until I made you pretend to be my fiancé . Attend social gatherings . Host dinner parties . ”
56451	56458	56408	56408	she	1010	“ Yes , but . . . ”
56477	56484	56462	56462	I	0	“ It also has its perks . ”

As soon as the ink is dry on that marriage certificate , she will not be the woman you think she is . That ’s what they do — they pretend to be cool so you ’ll propose , and then they turn into crazy , controlling lunatics once they ’ve got your last name . I ’ve never been so miserable . ”

57868	57890	57864	57864	He	100	“ Truth , man . If I was you , I ’d still be in L.A. fucking Zlatka in my Porsche . ”
57891	57898	57564	57564	Wade	100	“ I ’m sure you would . ”
57899	57915	57916	57916	He	100	“ How ’d you fuck that up , anyway ? She was crazy about you . ”
57920	57946	57916	57916	He	100	“ Susie said she read somewhere it was because Zlatka did n’t like being submissive in the bedroom . She wanted to be the boss . ”
57947	57957	57564	57564	Wade	100	“ You ’d have to ask Zlatka about that . ”
57958	57987	57564	57564	Wade	100	“ Dude , I ’d totally let her tie me up and slap me around if she wanted to . You really broke it off because of that ? ”
57988	57991	57916	57916	He	100	“ No . ”
57996	58006	57916	57916	He	100	“ We fought all the time . It sucked . ”
58007	58013	58014	58014	he	100	“ Tell me about it , ”
58017	58086	58014	58014	he	100	“ I ’m stuck on this yacht in the Mediterranean listening to Susie whine about what a shitty husband I am day in , day out . Like , what does she want that she does n’t have ? She ’s got the house , the car , the clothes , the vacations . I pay all her fucking bills . What more does she want from me ? ”
58099	58140	58093	58093	I	0	“ Anyway , that ’s all I ’m saying . Everyone pretends to be someone they ’re not to get what they want , and you ca n’t make anyone happy in the long run . Do n’t even try . ”
58229	58234	58235	58235	Felicity	151	“ Hey , you . ”
58256	58262	58235	58235	Felicity	151	“ How was your day ? ”
58263	58276	58235	58235	Felicity	151	“ It was okay . How did everything go with the proposal ? ”
58277	58283	58284	58284	She	1043	“ It was so great ! ”
58318	58347	58351	58351	her	1043	“ Ellie was completely surprised , and the whole thing went off without a hitch — which is pretty impressive , considering what an elaborate scheme it was . ”
58379	58403	58404	58404	Felicity	151	“ She had a bucket of fifty balls , and she kept throwing one after another , and she could not dunk him , ”
58409	58423	58404	58404	Felicity	151	“ Lucky for her , my cousin Chip Carswell was in the crowd ! ”
58424	58430	58431	58431	I	0	“ The White Sox pitcher ? ”
58436	58449	58431	58431	I	0	“ That ’s your cousin ? How did I not know that ? ”
58450	58531	58532	58532	My	0	“ Yes — he ’s Frannie ’s nephew . His mom is her older sister , April . And his dad is Tyler Shaw , who was also a Major League pitcher . Tyler and April are married now , but they had him when they were like eighteen and gave him up for adoption . They only reconnected later , when he was a teenager , but he was already off at college by the time you moved here . ”
58537	58577	58578	58578	She	1049	“ I guess I have a lot to learn about your family history . I never knew any of that . Carswell is a great pitcher . So was Shaw . Two of the best lefties in the game . ”
58581	58610	58578	58578	She	1049	“ Which Ellie was glad about , because she dragged Chip out there and made him throw for her . Gianni got dunked with every ball Chip threw . ”
58611	58615	58532	58532	My	0	“ I bet . ”
58616	58650	58532	58532	My	0	“ But it was only fair , because back when they were seventeen , Gianni dunked Ellie that many times . Then she threw a bunch of pies in his face in retaliation . ”
58651	58663	58578	58578	She	1049	“ So where in all that dunking did he propose tonight ? ”
58664	58685	58532	58532	My	0	“ Oh ! The last ball in the bucket was a fake — it opened up like a ring box . ”
58686	58691	58692	58692	She	1049	“ I ’m impressed . ”
58695	58701	58692	58692	She	1049	“ It was so romantic . ”
58702	58709	58532	58532	My	0	“ I assume she said yes ? ”
58710	58724	58725	58725	I	0	“ She said yes . Then he threw a pie in her face . ”
58752	58761	58735	58735	his	152	“ Sounds like it was quite a show . ”
58762	58794	58795	58795	I	0	“ It was amazing . I also spoke to Winnie . She said your mom confirmed the engagement party for thirty people at five o’clock , the last Saturday in July . ”
58798	58801	58795	58795	I	0	“ Great . ”
58802	58810	58735	58735	his	152	“ Did you practice your toast yet ? ”
58811	58814	58815	58815	I	0	“ No . ”
58822	58837	58838	58838	She	1049	“ But I did chat with the Prancin ’ Grannies for seven whole minutes . ”
58843	58855	58840	58840	her	1049	“ I ’m very proud of you . Was it hard ? ”
58856	58881	58735	58735	his	152	“ It was okay . I did n’t enjoy it , but I did n’t feel like my skin was crawling with fire ants . ”
58882	58892	58735	58735	his	152	“ I ’d say that ’s a good thing . ”
58893	58906	58840	58840	her	1049	“ Several of them know Daphne Sawyer . Is that your grandmother ? ”
58907	58964	58735	58735	his	152	“ Yes ! That ’s Frannie ’s mom . She ’s wonderful . She and her husband John were the original owners of Cloverleigh Farms , but they gave it to their kids , and now they live in Florida most of the year . They spend summers here , so they ’re probably in town . ”
58965	59007	59008	59008	Felicity	151	“ She ’s likely getting inundated with calls from the Prancin ’ Grannies right now . They were all very eager to establish a connection to the family . I think they ’re all hoping for an invitation to the wedding . ”
59014	59023	59008	59008	Felicity	151	“ Just tell them it ’s very small . ”
59024	59032	58735	58735	his	152	“ I did . They shamed me . ”
59033	59037	58735	58735	his	152	“ Shamed you ? ”
59038	59090	59091	59091	She	1051	“ Yes , they said this whole town is so happy for us and is n’t it just a bit selfish of me to have such a small wedding that no one else can share in the joy ? They told me to think about that , and they pranced away . ”
59096	59103	59091	59091	She	1051	“ I can picture it perfectly . ”
59104	59124	58735	58735	his	152	“ We ’re all set for New York , by the way . Our flight leaves at eleven tomorrow . ”
59125	59133	59134	59134	She	1051	“ What ? I need to pack ! ”
59146	59151	59134	59134	She	1051	“ How many nights ? ”
59152	59155	58735	58735	his	152	“ Two . ”
59156	59166	58735	58735	his	152	“ Will I have to dress up for anything ? ”
59167	59174	59175	59175	She	1051	“ Only if you want to . ”
59188	59203	59182	59182	her	1051	“ Hutton ! What are the plans ? Are we doing fancy billionaire things ? ”
59207	59214	59204	59204	I	0	“ What are fancy billionaire things ? ”
59215	59237	59238	59238	She	1051	“ You know — going to a ball or the opera or some sort of gala . Places fancy people go . ”
59249	59283	59238	59238	She	1051	“ Not that I need those things . I ’d be just as happy staying at a Motel 6 and eating pizza slices on the street . I just want to pack right . ”
59284	59313	59314	59314	She	1051	“ I do n’t know if there are any balls this week , Cinderella , but I would be glad to take you out . Pack something nice . ”
59332	59338	59323	59323	she	108	“ I ’m so excited ! ”
59339	59342	59343	59343	I	0	“ Good . ”
59691	59698	59688	59688	I	0	“ It ’s your turn tonight . ”
59699	59703	59688	59688	I	0	“ For what ? ”
59704	59727	59688	59688	I	0	“ The secret . I feel like it ’s always me rambling on about shit . Tonight , you tell me something . ”
59728	59738	59688	59688	I	0	“ Hmm . What do you want to know ? ”
59807	59822	59802	59802	she	1066	“ You mentioned that you break up with anyone who says they love you . ”
59823	59826	59802	59802	she	1066	“ Yes . ”
59827	59835	59802	59802	she	1066	“ How many times has that happened ? ”
59836	59839	59840	59840	she	1066	“ Twice , ”
59853	59863	59840	59840	she	1066	“ Once in college , and once in Chicago . ”
59864	59871	59802	59802	she	1066	“ How long were those relationships ? ”
59872	59881	59802	59802	she	1066	“ Not that long . A few months . ”
59882	59895	59802	59802	she	1066	“ And you did n’t feel that way about either of them ? ”
59896	59914	59915	59915	She	1066	“ Nope . I ’ve never been in love . I ’m very careful with my emotions . ”
59921	59929	59915	59915	She	1066	“ I ’m good at rationing them . ”
59930	59936	59802	59802	she	1066	“ What do you mean ? ”
59937	59987	59802	59802	she	1066	“ Well , let ’s say feelings are like a super rare or expensive ingredient . Truffles or something . You do n’t just throw them in whole . You shave them , adding a tiny amount to finish off the dish . A little goes a long way . ”
59988	59998	59999	59999	She	1066	“ Got it . So you shave your feelings ? ”
60006	60053	59999	59999	She	1066	“ You know what I mean . I give them out sparingly . And when the person I ’m dating dishes them out too generously , too quickly , I go into panic mode and just want out . I told you , it ’s weird . ”
60054	60061	60064	60064	her	1066	“ No , I get it , ”
60066	60079	60062	60062	I	0	“ That ’s me at a business meeting . Or a party . ”
60080	60099	59999	59999	She	1066	“ Yeah , but at least you can sneak out . I have to craft an exit strategy . ”
60100	60104	60105	60105	She	1066	“ Like what ? ”
60108	60172	60105	60105	She	1066	“ Okay , I ’m not proud of this , but I told the first guy I was thinking about becoming a nun and wanted to try out celibacy . That was enough to scare him off . I told the second guy I was moving back to Michigan . But he kept coming around , so then I actually had to move . ”
60173	60189	60190	60190	She	1066	“ Wait a minute . You moved back here to get out of a relationship ? ”
60195	60262	60190	60190	She	1066	“ Not only for that reason . I ’d been thinking about it for a while . But that was a good push — and it was the right decision . I ’m happy I came back . And . . . I did n’t love those guys . If I had , I would n’t have been able to walk away so easily . Right ? ”
60263	60286	60105	60105	She	1066	“ You ’re asking the wrong person . I ’ve never been in love either . I ’m not wired for it . ”
60287	60293	60105	60105	She	1066	“ How do you mean ? ”
60294	60341	60342	60342	She	1068	“ I mean , some people are good at getting out of their heads and letting someone else have , I do n’t know , unfettered access to them — all their flaws and imperfections . Revealing themselves . That ’s never going to be me . ”
60357	60377	60342	60342	She	1068	“ Do you think something is wrong with us ? I sometimes wonder if I ’m cursed or something . ”
60378	60381	60382	60382	I	0	“ No , ”
60386	60412	60382	60382	I	0	“ I think we ’re just fine . In fact , I think we ’re smarter than everyone , because we know ourselves so well . ”
60422	60444	60413	60413	She	1068	“ Yes , exactly . What good does it do to stay in a relationship you know wo n’t work out ? ”
60445	60462	60463	60463	She	1068	“ If we ’re cursed , it ’s with superior intelligence and keen self - awareness . ”
60466	60504	60463	60463	She	1068	“ Yes ! We know our strengths and weaknesses . We know that if we ca n’t swim , we do n’t jump in the deep end of the pool . We stay in the shallow part . ”
60505	60516	60517	60517	I	0	“ Or we skip the swim and stay in bed , ”
60527	60540	60517	60517	I	0	“ There ’s a lot of fun to be had in bed . ”
60541	60547	60548	60548	She	1068	“ There is with you . ”
60560	60568	60556	60556	she	1068	“ More than I ever thought possible . ”
60601	60609	60599	60599	royalty	1073	“ Hutton ! Look at this view ! ”
60627	60633	60634	60634	He	1074	“ I ’ve seen it . ”
60648	60654	60634	60634	He	1074	“ But it is impressive . ”
60655	60672	60673	60673	I	0	“ It ’s more than impressive — it ’s unreal ! This whole day is unreal ! ”
60779	60785	60786	60786	he	1084	“ We should get going , ”
60789	60798	60786	60786	he	1084	“ Are you going to tell me where ? ”
60799	60811	60786	60786	he	1084	“ No . That ’s the whole point of a surprise . ”
60812	60817	60825	60825	he	1084	“ You hate surprises . ”
60818	60824	60825	60825	he	1084	“ I hate being surprised , ”
60828	60834	60825	60825	he	1084	“ There ’s a difference . ”
60835	60847	60848	60848	He	1084	“ Let me just get a few pics of the bathroom . ”
60893	60904	60905	60905	Hutton	151	“ It will still be here when we get back , ”
60931	60946	60947	60947	I	0	“ I know . Sorry , you ’re probably used to all this luxury , ”
60951	60999	60947	60947	I	0	“ But I ’m more of a budget traveler , so this is pretty cool to me . And chances are I ’m only going to be the fake fiancée of a billionaire once in my life , so I want to make the most of it . ”
61003	61015	61000	61000	He	1084	“ Go ahead . We can leave when you ’re ready . ”
61056	61073	61047	61047	he	1084	“ Am I dressed okay ? You look so nice , and I ’m in jeans . ”
61074	61082	61021	61021	he	1084	“ You can wear anything you want . ”
61083	61099	61047	61047	he	1084	“ And I ’ll have time to come home and change before dinner , right ? ”
61100	61103	61047	61047	he	1084	“ Yes . ”
61104	61112	61021	61021	he	1084	“ Then I just need a minute . ”
61113	61132	61133	61133	He	1084	“ No problem . I ’m going to check in with my assistant on our tickets for tonight . ”
61301	61304	61305	61305	I	0	“ Hey . ”
61311	61334	61335	61335	He	1096	“ Thanks for all this . It was n’t necessary , but it ’s the best vacation I ’ve ever been on . ”
61338	61352	61335	61335	He	1096	“ We just got here . We have n’t even done anything yet . ”
61353	61379	61309	61309	him	1096	“ Does n’t matter what we do , and maybe it would n’t even matter where we are . I just love being with you . ”
61380	61396	61335	61335	He	1096	“ Okay , I need you to remember that nice feeling in about three minutes . ”
61397	61402	61403	61403	He	1096	“ What ? Why ? ”
61409	61414	61403	61403	He	1096	“ Or one minute . ”
61437	61445	61415	61415	I	0	“ Hutton ! What ’s going on ? ”
61446	61453	61454	61454	I	0	“ Just relax and have fun . ”
61465	61478	61454	61454	I	0	“ You said no Tiffany . We agreed on a replica ring . ”
61479	61501	61514	61515	The driver	1099	“ But we need to know what we ’re replicating , right ? This is just a little exercise in reconnaissance . ”
61502	61506	61454	61454	I	0	“ It is ? ”
61507	61513	61514	61515	The driver	1099	“ Yes . Trust me . ”
61556	61568	61551	61551	He	1096	“ Felicity , come on . It ’s just for fun . ”
61569	61572	61551	61551	He	1096	“ Really ? ”
61573	61603	61551	61551	He	1096	“ Yes . I thought you ’d enjoy it , but if you want , we do n’t even have to go in . I ’ll cancel the appointment . ”
61604	61613	61614	61614	I	0	“ No , no . It ’s fine . ”
61628	61633	61620	61620	him	1096	“ I trust you . ”
61722	61727	61728	61728	he	151	“ Are you okay ? ”
61740	61745	61728	61728	he	151	“ You seem nervous . ”
61746	61753	61754	61754	I	0	“ Of course I ’m nervous ! ”
61758	61769	61754	61754	I	0	“ These rings probably cost more than my college education . ”
61770	61783	61728	61728	he	151	“ Stop worrying about that . This is supposed to be fun . ”
61784	61791	61792	61792	James	172	“ It is , but I — ”
61799	61808	61792	61792	James	172	“ Here we go . Try this one . ”
61880	61883	61884	61884	I	0	“ Oh , ”
61887	61893	61884	61884	I	0	“ It ’s so beautiful . ”
61894	61902	61904	61904	James	172	“ I think that ’s the one , ”
61907	61911	61904	61904	James	172	“ Is it ? ”
61929	61936	61916	61916	I	0	“ Yes . This is it . ”
61965	61973	61916	61916	I	0	“ Champagne sounds great , thank you . ”
61989	62006	61981	61981	I	0	“ You ’re not going to buy it , right ? That is n’t the plan . ”
62007	62013	62014	62014	he	172	“ I know the plan , ”
62018	62027	62014	62014	he	172	“ Then why are you smiling like that ? ”
62028	62032	61981	61981	I	0	“ Like what ? ”
62033	62043	62044	62044	He	172	“ Like you know something I do n’t know . ”
62047	62054	62044	62044	He	172	“ I thought you trusted me . ”
62055	62061	61981	61981	I	0	“ I changed my mind . ”
62062	62065	62066	62066	He	172	“ Felicity . ”
62071	62084	62066	62066	He	172	“ You can relax . We ’ll leave here without a ring . ”
62085	62088	61981	61981	I	0	“ Promise ? ”
62089	62092	62093	62093	He	172	“ Yes . ”
62105	62109	62093	62093	He	172	“ I promise . ”
62110	62114	62115	62115	James	172	“ Ms. MacAllister ? ”
62214	62220	62221	62221	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
62225	62235	62221	62221	I	0	“ Should we look around for a replica ring ? ”
62236	62261	62262	62262	I	0	“ Not in this neighborhood . I thought maybe tomorrow we could go down to Chinatown . There are lots of jewelry stores there . ”
62273	62279	62262	62262	I	0	“ That sounds like fun . ”
62280	62324	62221	62221	I	0	“ The car should be here any minute . While we were inside , my assistant texted that we have a dinner reservation at 5:30 , and our tickets will be waiting for us at the Met box office for a 7:30 ballet . ”
62325	62333	62221	62221	I	0	“ Ooooh ! What are we seeing ? ”
62334	62345	62262	62262	I	0	“ Romeo and Juliet performed by the American Ballet Theater . ”
62346	62353	62354	62354	I	0	“ Really ? That ’s perfect ! ”
62359	62373	62354	62354	I	0	“ But that does n’t leave much time for us to get ready . ”
62374	62404	62405	62405	He	1113	“ We ’re having dinner downstairs at The Pierre , so we ’ll be fine . And if you need more time , I ’ll have dinner sent up . ”
62411	62417	62405	62405	He	1113	“ Here ’s the car . ”
62458	62465	62467	62468	the driver	1099	“ Of course , Mr. French , ”
62470	62477	62478	62478	I	0	“ Is that the same guy ? ”
62486	62496	62478	62478	I	0	“ Yes . I hired him for three days . ”
62497	62506	62507	62507	Hutton	151	“ So he just waits around for us ? ”
62510	62522	62507	62507	Hutton	151	“ That ’s his job . I pay for his time . ”
62523	62526	62527	62527	I	0	“ Sheesh . ”
62540	62588	62527	62527	I	0	“ How do you get used to this ? To being able to afford luxuries like not ever having to hail a cab , and fireplaces in your hotel rooms , and — oh yeah — chartering private jets to take you where you want to go ? ”
62589	62598	62599	62599	he	151	“ At first , it was really strange , ”
62602	62664	62665	62665	I	0	“ For a long time , I was still riding my bike everywhere , staying at inexpensive places , flying coach . Wade always thought I was crazy . But he ’d grown up with a ton of money , so he was used to luxury . My mother does n’t even throw away those plastic containers cream cheese comes in . ”
62668	62680	62665	62665	I	0	“ How ’d you finally get more comfortable with being rich ? ”
62681	62707	62527	62527	I	0	“ Little by little , I guess . I ’m still not completely used to it , and I do feel guilty about it sometimes . ”
62708	62723	62724	62724	He	151	“ But you give a lot of money to charity , do n’t you ? ”
62727	62781	62724	62724	He	151	“ Yes , and that helps . I also paid off all my sister ’s college loans and her grad school tuition . I offered to buy both her and Neil and my parents new houses , but they all told me to fuck off — not in those words , of course . ”
62787	62799	62784	62784	his	151	“ Actually , I think my sister did use those words . ”
62800	62805	62806	62806	I	0	“ I believe it , ”
62809	62817	62806	62806	I	0	“ She seems very independent and proud . ”
62818	62826	62829	62829	I	0	“ She is all that and more . ”
62834	62887	62829	62829	I	0	“ I have an older sister too . I know how they can be . It ’s funny , I have n’t been to a ballet in forever , but Millie used to perform in them — not professionally , but she was a pretty serious dance student back in the day . ”
62888	62892	62893	62893	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? ”
62896	62922	62893	62893	I	0	“ She danced until she was maybe fifteen or so and then quit . She even went to a performing arts school for a year . ”
62923	62929	62806	62806	I	0	“ Why did she quit ? ”
62930	62996	62829	62829	I	0	“ She said she just outgrew her passion for it , but I think a lot of it was related to pressure to look a certain way . Ballet dancers are traditionally very thin and small - boned , and Millie is built differently — it was a constant struggle for her to maintain a certain size and she was just tired of fighting it . ”
62997	63006	62893	62893	I	0	“ Was it hard for her to quit ? ”
63007	63061	63062	63062	I	0	“ Oh yeah . There were a lot of tears and serious talks behind closed doors . But I think my dad and Frannie were really glad she decided to quit because she was so unhappy . I was only like eleven or twelve , but I remember the tension in the house . ”
63089	63139	63076	63076	her	83	“ But she seemed relieved once the decision was made . Plus , the twins had just been born , so there was a lot of chaos in the house . Frannie was glad to have Millie around more often to help . She was so good with them . ”
63140	63145	63146	63146	I	0	“ You were n’t ? ”
63149	63198	63146	63146	I	0	“ Not like Millie was . I thought they were noisy and boring . I liked them better when they got bigger and I could read stories to them — they liked the silly voices I ’d do . But anyway , I ’m really excited about tonight . ”
63225	63245	63206	63206	I	0	“ Thanks again for everything . Sorry I got a little weird back there . I do trust you . ”
63246	63254	63255	63255	We	1121	“ Good . And you ’re welcome . ”
63471	63474	63462	63462	Millie	83	“ Hello ? ”
63475	63482	63483	63483	I	0	“ Are you dripping in diamonds ? ”
63486	63499	63483	63483	I	0	“ No . I tried on a few today at Tiffany though . ”
63503	63513	63500	63500	She	83	“ Stop it ! You really went to Tiffany ? ”
63514	63533	63462	63462	Millie	83	“ Yes , but only to look . We ’re going to Chinatown tomorrow to buy a fake . ”
63534	63543	63462	63462	Millie	83	“ The best cubic zirconia money can buy ? ”
63544	63558	63500	63500	She	83	“ Exactly . Believe me , he ’s spending enough on this trip . ”
63559	63568	63462	63462	Millie	83	“ How ’s everything going with you two ? ”
63569	63572	63462	63462	Millie	83	“ Great . ”
63573	63585	63462	63462	Millie	83	“ Are the rumors true ? Did he tie you up ? ”
63586	63593	63500	63500	She	83	“ Maybe , and not yet . ”
63594	63599	63600	63600	I	0	“ Wait , what ? ”
63616	63640	63641	63641	She	83	“ I think there is some truth to those rumors , but he has n’t really shown me that side of himself yet . ”
63644	63651	63652	63652	I	0	“ So would you let him ? ”
63658	63684	63652	63652	I	0	“ I have to go because we ’re leaving in like twenty minutes and I still do n’t know what I ’m going to wear . ”
63685	63693	63734	63734	her	83	“ Do you have a safe word ? ”
63694	63697	63734	63734	her	83	“ Millie ! ”
63698	63704	63652	63652	I	0	“ I suggest something else . ”
63705	63714	63734	63734	her	83	“ I do n’t need a safe word . ”
63715	63723	63734	63734	her	83	“ Oklahoma . Bumblebee . Roy Kent . ”
63724	63729	63734	63734	her	83	“ Goodbye , Millie . ”
63840	63867	63827	63827	Hutton	151	“ Hey , I have to run down to the business center for a fax from Wade . I ’ll be back in a few minutes . ”
63876	63879	63868	63868	I	0	“ Okay . ”
64138	64141	64142	64142	I	0	“ Hi , ”
64154	64157	64145	64145	He	151	“ Jesus . ”
64158	64165	64145	64145	He	151	“ Is that good or bad ? ”
64166	64180	64181	64181	I	0	“ You took my breath away . I ’d say that ’s good . ”
64184	64193	64181	64181	I	0	“ Thank you . You look very handsome . ”
64253	64262	64250	64250	his	151	“ I feel like I should have shaved . ”
64263	64276	64279	64279	he	151	“ Nah , I like the scruff . Gives you some edge . ”
64289	64292	64279	64279	he	151	“ Thanks . ”
64293	64298	64299	64299	I	0	“ Should we go ? ”
64305	64310	64299	64299	I	0	“ Our reservation is — ”
64311	64316	64317	64317	He	151	“ Just a minute . ”
64336	64339	64340	64340	He	151	“ Hutton . ”
64368	64371	64360	64360	I	0	“ Hutton . ”
64372	64375	64404	64404	his	151	“ Yes . ”
64376	64389	64360	64360	I	0	“ Tell me that is not the ring I tried on today . ”
64390	64401	64402	64402	I	0	“ That is not the ring you tried on today . ”
64415	64427	64402	64402	I	0	“ Liar ! You said we were leaving without the ring ! ”
64428	64453	64360	64360	I	0	“ We did . This one came from another store . It has a stone with better clarity . That one had a blemish . ”
64454	64458	64459	64459	I	0	“ A blemish ? ”
64462	64465	64459	64459	I	0	“ Yes . ”
64466	64469	64470	64470	I	0	“ Hutton . ”
64475	64513	64470	64470	I	0	“ Tell me this is only on loan , like the necklace was in the movie . Remember ? Richard Gere does not actually purchase the necklace for her . He only borrows it for the night . ”
64514	64526	64527	64527	He	151	“ Richard Gere ’s not a real billionaire . I am . ”
64543	64549	64527	64527	He	151	“ Will you wear it ? ”
64569	64574	64575	64575	I	0	“ Oh , God , ”
64587	64602	64575	64575	I	0	“ I want to , I really do — but it ’s too much . ”
64603	64612	64613	64613	He	151	“ It ’s just a gift , Felicity . ”
64626	64634	64613	64613	He	151	“ Let me give you a gift . ”
64635	64639	64640	64640	My	0	“ For what ? ”
64654	64666	64640	64640	My	0	“ I do n’t need a gift for being your friend . ”
64667	64690	64613	64613	He	151	“ It ’s not really for anything . It ’s a symbol of our friendship . It ’s a gesture of appreciation . ”
64691	64694	64695	64695	I	0	“ Huttonnnnn , ”
64706	64729	64695	64695	I	0	“ A gesture of appreciation is a latte or a sandwich . This is a diamond ring . It ’s too much . ”
64752	64756	64757	64757	he	151	“ I understand , ”
64761	64807	64757	64757	he	151	“ that this is unusual . I know most people do n’t gift diamond rings to their friends — it ’s traditionally something reserved for the one person you ’re going to spend your life with . Your soul mate . But you know what ? ”
64808	64811	64812	64812	He	151	“ What ? ”
64820	64884	64812	64812	He	151	“ At the risk of sounding a little crazy , my mom taught me that there are all kinds of soul mates — past - life soul mates , kindred spirits , soul ties . . . She thinks there are certain people you just feel a deep , extraordinary connection with , and it transcends time and place as we know it . ”
64885	64890	64903	64903	him	151	“ I believe that , ”
64912	64969	64903	64903	him	151	“ So think of this as a symbol of that connection . Because even though we are n’t getting married , you are the person I cherish most , someone I will always want in my life . In fact , I feel one hundred percent certain our friendship will outlast all of Wade ’s marriages . ”
64991	65039	64983	64983	I	0	“ This is n’t a real proposal , because this is n’t a real engagement . But I thought maybe we could have one real thing to celebrate our friendship and the way we show up for each other . Something that will outlast this fake engagement . ”
65050	65059	65047	65047	he	151	“ And honestly , I can afford it . ”
65081	65103	65071	65071	Hutton	151	“ If you never want to wear the ring , you do n’t have to . But will you accept it ? ”
65113	65116	65104	65104	I	0	“ Okay . ”
65117	65120	65121	65121	He	151	“ Good . ”
65129	65134	65121	65121	He	151	“ Let ’s go . ”
65169	65198	65159	65159	I	0	“ You know , I ’ve never been the girl who craves fancy , shiny things , but I am head over heels in love with this ring . ”
65199	65202	65159	65159	I	0	“ Good . ”
65203	65207	65208	65208	I	0	“ But Hutton . ”
65222	65233	65234	65234	He	151	“ No more expensive surprises , okay ? Promise me . ”
65240	65251	65234	65234	He	151	“ That ’s no fun . I like treating you . ”
65252	65269	65270	65270	He	151	“ But this is all one - sided ! How am I going to treat you ? ”
65286	65291	65270	65270	He	151	“ We ’ll talk . ”
65344	65348	65349	65349	Hutton	151	“ Another time , ”
65352	65367	65349	65349	Hutton	151	“ I ’ll make sure you get to taste it before we go home . ”
65395	65404	65405	65405	I	0	“ Do you know where the seats are ? ”
65426	65430	65405	65405	I	0	“ Not exactly . ”
65450	65457	65458	65458	I	0	“ Here . Let me see . ”
65518	65523	65524	65524	I	0	“ Wait a minute . ”
65528	65535	65524	65524	I	0	“ Are all these seats ours ? ”
65536	65545	65546	65546	Hutton	151	“ Yes . I bought the whole box , ”
65549	65554	65555	65555	I	0	“ I like privacy . ”
65558	65565	65566	65566	He	151	“ One of those billionaire perks ? ”
65569	65572	65566	65566	He	151	“ Exactly . ”
65629	65639	65620	65620	I	0	“ This is amazing ! It ’s so beautiful ! ”
65640	65644	65645	65645	Hutton	151	“ It is . ”
65651	65659	65645	65645	Hutton	151	“ Do you come here a lot ? ”
65660	65684	65620	65620	I	0	“ Not really . I brought my parents here once — my dad likes opera — and I attended the fundraising gala once . ”
65685	65704	65705	65705	He	151	“ Oooh , I bet that was fancy . Ball gowns and tuxes ? Cocktails and small talk ? ”
65708	65715	65705	65705	He	151	“ I lasted about twenty minutes . ”
65723	65739	65716	65716	I	0	“ Well , do n’t worry . I wo n’t make you talk to me . ”
65740	65751	65752	65752	My	0	“ I like talking to you . Among other things . ”
65912	65919	65920	65920	I	0	“ The dancers were so graceful , ”
65923	65975	65920	65920	I	0	“ So elegant and artistic but also strong and powerful . It ’s amazing how much emotion they can convey just by moving their arms a certain way . Or changing the angle of their head . They have such incredible command of every muscle in their bodies , you know ? ”
65976	65979	65980	65980	he	151	“ Yes , ”
66015	66027	66002	66002	him	151	“ Sorry ! I ’m talking nonstop , are n’t I ? ”
66028	66034	65990	65990	his	151	“ I do n’t mind . ”
66035	66044	65990	65990	his	151	“ I just loved it all so much . ”
66045	66059	66002	66002	him	151	“ I ’m glad . Want something to drink ? Whiskey or scotch ? ”
66060	66075	65990	65990	his	151	“ No , thanks . Mostly I just want to take these heels off . ”
66076	66081	66082	66082	I	0	“ Leave them on . ”
66108	66111	66098	66098	him	151	“ What ? ”
66112	66122	66123	66123	I	0	“ Leave them on . And come over here . ”
66132	66139	66123	66123	I	0	“ On your hands and knees . ”
66238	66242	66243	66243	he	151	“ Good girl , ”
66257	66262	66243	66243	he	151	“ Now come here . ”
66451	66456	66498	66498	His	1158	“ Are you okay ? ”
66457	66460	66498	66498	His	1158	“ Yes . ”
66461	66478	66479	66479	He	1158	“ If there ’s a point tonight where you are not , you should tell me . ”
66491	66497	66487	66487	I	0	“ Like a safe word ? ”
66516	66524	66506	66506	His	1158	“ You already have a safe word ? ”
66525	66528	66529	66529	I	0	“ No , ”
66533	66541	66529	66529	I	0	“ I ’ve never needed one before . ”
66542	66547	66548	66548	He	1158	“ You do now . ”
66554	66561	66548	66548	He	1158	“ So what will it be ? ”
66577	66581	66582	66582	I	0	“ Roy Kent , ”
66597	66603	66585	66585	He	1158	“ Who ’s Roy Kent ? ”
66604	66608	66587	66587	his	1158	“ Never mind . ”
66614	66622	66626	66626	Oklahoma	174	“ I ’ll think of another one . ”
66641	66644	66645	66645	I	0	“ Romeo , ”
66649	66659	66645	66645	I	0	“ That ’s what I ’ll say . Romeo . ”
66685	66692	66693	66693	I	0	“ Is anything going to hurt ? ”
66713	66734	66693	66693	I	0	“ I do n’t need to inflict pain to feel in control , if that ’s what you ’re asking . ”
66735	66741	66750	66750	he	1158	“ Okay . Should I — ”
66770	66812	66750	66750	he	1158	“ Shhh . From now on , you do n’t speak until I ask a question . You do n’t move unless I tell you how . You do n’t come until I give you permission . Nod if you understand . ”
66927	66938	66922	66922	he	1158	“ You do n’t move unless I tell you to . ”
66968	66976	66959	66959	He	1158	“ Good girl . You learn quickly . ”
67002	67007	67008	67008	he	1158	“ You surprise me , ”
67022	67055	67056	67056	He	1158	“ All night I ’ve been hard thinking about what you might be wearing under that dress . But I never imagined this . I like it , especially with those shoes . ”
67082	67106	67073	67073	his	1158	“ Those heels have been driving me crazy all night . I want to do such bad things to you in those heels . ”
67194	67207	67180	67180	He	1158	“ Do you want to watch me do bad things to you ? ”
67219	67226	67180	67180	He	1158	“ You can answer the question . ”
67227	67230	67231	67231	I	0	“ Yes , ”
67234	67239	67231	67231	I	0	“ Yes , what ? ”
67240	67254	67257	67257	him	1158	“ Yes , I want to watch you do bad things to me . ”
67293	67299	67300	67300	he	1158	“ You ’re so beautiful , ”
67312	67329	67300	67300	he	1158	“ So sweet . So polite . Like a princess . And you smell so good . ”
67483	67486	67487	67487	His	1158	“ No . ”
67499	67508	67509	67509	He	1158	“ That ’s breaking a rule , princess . ”
67516	67536	67537	67537	He	1158	“ You do n’t move unless I tell you to . But I can help you remember to obey . ”
67821	67827	67816	67816	his	1158	“ You ’re wet already . ”
67828	67831	67832	67832	I	0	“ Yes , ”
67842	67879	67835	67835	He	1158	“ That was n’t a question . But since you ’re having such a hard time staying quiet , I ’ll give you permission to speak . Do you want to watch me make you come ? ”
67907	67911	67912	67912	he	1158	“ Say it , ”
67915	67925	67926	67926	I	0	“ I want to watch you make me come , ”
67942	67965	67929	67929	He	1158	“ The taste of you . That ’s another thing that drives me crazy . I ca n’t stop thinking about it . ”
67974	67982	67966	67966	His	1158	“ I want it all the time . ”
68151	68155	68156	68156	he	1158	“ Not yet , ”
68270	68277	68278	68278	he	1158	“ Do n’t close your eyes , ”
68281	68284	68278	68278	he	1158	“ Watch . ”
68341	68346	68347	68347	he	1158	“ You ’re perfect , ”
68357	68363	68350	68350	his	1158	“ You ’re fucking perfect . ”
68397	68400	68401	68401	he	1158	“ Yes , ”
68411	68419	68420	68420	He	1158	“ I want you just like this . ”
68522	68527	68528	68528	he	1158	“ Such bad things , ”
68593	68597	68598	68598	Hutton	151	“ Fuck yes . ”
68706	68709	68710	68710	I	0	“ Hutton , ”

68723	68731	68732	68732	He	1158	“ I want that too , princess . ”
68740	68779	68732	68732	He	1158	“ I want my cock right here . I want to make you come again . But this is a game about patience . About control . We ca n’t just give in to every urge we feel . ”
68780	68783	68784	68784	I	0	“ Romeo , ”
68787	68794	68795	68795	He	1158	“ Now can we give in ? ”
68798	68816	68795	68795	He	1158	“ It does n’t work like that . It ’s a safe word , not a password . ”
68817	68825	68732	68732	He	1158	“ But I want you so badly . ”
68846	68860	68834	68834	I	0	“ I ’ve never wanted anyone this way . I have no control . ”
68861	68870	68871	68871	He	1158	“ You do n’t have to have control . ”
68891	68904	68871	68871	He	1158	“ You have to surrender it . That ’s what I like . ”
68923	68931	68905	68905	I	0	“ Surrender is harder than I thought . ”
68932	68938	68939	68939	He	1158	“ I know it is . ”
68945	68973	68939	68939	He	1158	“ But you ’re doing so well , princess . You ’re such a good girl , and I ’m going to give you what you want . ”
68974	68978	68979	68979	I	0	“ You are ? ”
69020	69023	69024	69024	he	1158	“ Yes , ”
69027	69038	69024	69024	he	1158	“ But you have to tell me what that is . ”
69039	69047	69048	69048	I	0	“ I want you to fuck me , ”
69057	69070	69053	69053	He	1158	“ What happened to my sweet princess ? Where are her manners ? ”
69071	69081	69082	69082	I	0	“ I want you to fuck me , please ? ”
69085	69090	69091	69091	He	1158	“ That ’s better . ”
69155	69158	69159	69159	he	1158	“ Fuck , ”
69162	69178	69159	69159	he	1158	“ It ’s so tight . So hot . And you look so fucking good . ”
69273	69278	69279	69279	he	1158	“ Come for me , ”
69282	69307	69279	69279	he	1158	“ Come right now , on my cock . On my fingers . Let me feel it . Then I ’ll come for you . ”
69308	69311	69312	69312	I	0	“ Yes ! ”
69451	69456	69457	69457	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
69460	69468	69457	69457	I	0	“ That was — oh my God . ”
69483	69515	69474	69474	his	151	“ I did n’t have a condom . That ’s why I did it that way . Although truth be told , that ’s what I wanted to do to you . ”
69516	69521	69522	69522	He	151	“ I liked it . ”
69530	69546	69522	69522	He	151	“ I ’ll clean you up . Give me a second to grab a towel . ”
69547	69553	69474	69474	his	151	“ Okay , but Hutton ? ”
69554	69557	69474	69474	his	151	“ Yes ? ”
69558	69572	69577	69577	he	151	“ Can you take my shoes off ? My feet are killing me . ”
69593	69597	69577	69577	he	151	“ Thank you . ”
69635	69651	69614	69614	He	151	“ There . But do n’t move too much . You ’re a little messy . ”
69666	69671	69672	69672	He	151	“ It ’s okay . ”
69698	69728	69689	69689	he	151	“ You might still be a little sticky . And I also got some , uh , stuff in your hair . Want to take a shower or something ? ”
69729	69732	69733	69733	I	0	“ Maybe . ”
69749	69758	69744	69744	I	0	“ Actually yes , that might feel good . ”
69759	69767	69768	69768	I	0	“ Let me run it for you . ”
69771	69786	69768	69768	I	0	“ You do n’t have to do that . You did n’t break me . ”
69787	69794	69795	69795	He	151	“ It ’s not an apology . ”
69800	69809	69795	69795	He	151	“ I just like doing things for you . ”
69873	69887	69863	69863	his	151	“ It ’s nice , but it ’s not as good as yours . ”
69888	69899	69900	69900	I	0	“ I brought some lotion in the scent you like , ”
69904	69913	69900	69900	I	0	“ I ’ll put it on before bed . ”
70018	70022	70023	70023	he	151	“ Come here , ”
70034	70042	70023	70023	he	151	“ I have a surprise for you . ”
70043	70047	70048	70048	I	0	“ You do ? ”
70080	70092	70075	70075	Hutton	151	“ Tada ! Warm chocolate cake with raspberry creamsicle ice cream . ”
70103	70110	70093	70093	I	0	“ You made a phone call ! ”
70111	70118	70050	70050	him	151	“ I made a phone call . ”
70119	70130	70131	70131	He	151	“ How did you get it up here so fast ? ”
70134	70141	70131	70131	He	151	“ I paid a little extra . ”
70142	70155	70050	70050	him	151	“ It looks so good , I bet it ’s worth it . ”
70156	70163	70164	70164	I	0	“ Your reaction is worth it . ”
70169	70202	70203	70203	He	151	“ You ’re spoiling me way too much on this trip . I ’m going to be terrible to live with . You ’ll be glad you ’re going back to California . ”
70206	70210	70203	70203	He	151	“ Sit down . ”
70247	70252	70253	70253	I	0	“ What ’s this ? ”
70269	70280	70256	70256	he	151	“ It ’s a combination of dessert and foot massage . ”
70343	70356	70357	70357	He	151	“ God , this is insane . I might have another orgasm . ”
70360	70367	70357	70357	He	151	“ That would be okay too . ”
70370	70374	70375	70375	she	1170	“ Your turn , ”
70379	70384	70375	70375	she	1170	“ Tell me something . ”
70385	70395	70396	70396	I	0	“ What do you want to know this time ? ”
70414	70439	70396	70396	I	0	“ If you could do anything else with your life , like if it had gone in another direction , where would you be ? ”
70615	70654	70605	70605	She	1170	“ You ca n’t think of anything ? I guess that ’s what it ’s like being a hot billionaire . You ’ve reached the zenith . There ’s nowhere else to go . Nothing else to achieve . ”
70658	70661	70655	70655	I	0	“ Hardly . ”
70662	70685	70686	70686	I	0	“ Okay , so then what ? Like , let ’s say you never created that algorithm . What would you be ? ”
70692	70699	70686	70686	I	0	“ Okay . Do n’t laugh . ”
70700	70705	70655	70655	I	0	“ I would never ! ”
70706	70722	70655	70655	I	0	“ I ’d have liked to teach math . Like be a professor or something . ”
70723	70736	70686	70686	I	0	“ I could see that . You ’d be great at it . ”
70737	70758	70655	70655	I	0	“ Uh , standing at the front of a room with everyone watching me ? I do n’t think so . ”
70759	70782	70655	70655	I	0	“ Yes , you would . You were a great tutor back in the day — those middle school kids loved you . ”
70783	70842	70655	70655	I	0	“ That was one on one . Teaching a class is very different . You have to be on every single minute . You have to explain things exactly right , you ca n’t get a single word wrong . If you say something in error , you look like you do n’t know what you ’re doing . ”
70843	70859	70655	70655	I	0	“ I ’m not saying being a teacher is easy or does n’t take preparation . ”
70860	70931	70932	70932	She	1175	“ It does n’t matter how prepared I am . I could plan a lecture , rehearse it a thousand times , bring notes into the classroom with me , and still second guess myself to the point where I ’m standing up there sweating and shaking , unable to even read my own writing because a hundred pairs of eyes are on me waiting for me to fuck up . ”
70939	70945	70932	70932	She	1175	“ Did this actually happen ? ”
70946	70949	70655	70655	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
70950	70953	70655	70655	I	0	“ When ? ”
70954	70983	70932	70932	She	1175	“ A couple years ago , I was invited to give a guest lecture at M.I.T. to one of my mentor teachers ’ classes , and I bombed . ”
70984	70990	70655	70655	I	0	“ Your mentor said that ? ”
70991	71053	70655	70655	I	0	“ No . But I knew she thought that . And I knew every kid in that room was like , ‘ who is this fucking hack and why does he make billions of dollars when he ca n’t even form a coherent sentence or write on the board without staring at every problem wondering if he wrote it right ? ’ ”
71054	71067	71071	71071	her	1175	“ Wow . That ’s so cool that you can read minds . ”
71073	71081	71068	71068	I	0	“ That ’s what it felt like . ”
71082	71085	71086	71086	She	1175	“ Sorry . ”
71090	71118	71086	71086	She	1175	“ But if I do n’t call you out on this stuff , who will ? It ’s like Winnie with the Wicked Witch of the West . ”
71119	71122	70655	70655	I	0	“ Huh ? ”
71123	71216	71217	71217	She	1176	“ Everyone in my family always wanted to watch the Wizard of Oz , but that witch scared the bejesus out of Winnie . She would hide under a blanket every time the witch came onscreen . But then Frannie bought us a nonfiction book about witches . We learned the truth about where the idea behind evil witches came from , and how female healers and priestesses were accused of getting their magic powers from the devil when really , it was just terrible men trying to suppress women ’s influence . ”
71225	71232	71233	71233	I	0	“ Sorry for all terrible men , ”
71237	71268	71269	71269	She	1176	“ Apology accepted . Anyway , I think your fears are based on something you ’re guessing at rather than something you know for sure . Just like a witch . ”
71283	71294	71269	71269	She	1176	“ Not real . Feels real , but is n’t . ”
71295	71324	71325	71325	She	1176	“ Okay , but that does n’t make my nerves any better . The thoughts are still there . And they cause physical reactions I ca n’t hide . ”
71331	71363	71364	71364	I	0	“ Would you consider trying therapy again ? This is going to make me sad that you have a dream to teach but wo n’t do it because of the witch . ”
71367	71390	71364	71364	I	0	“ My sister wants me to try acceptance and commitment therapy . There ’s a woman in her practice who does it . ”
71391	71403	71325	71325	She	1176	“ Can you get in to see her before you leave ? ”
71404	71410	71364	71364	I	0	“ It wo n’t work . ”
71411	71417	71364	71364	I	0	“ How do you know ? ”
71422	71437	71418	71418	She	1176	“ This is something new , right ? An approach you ’ve never tried ? ”
71438	71443	71444	71444	I	0	“ Does n’t matter , ”
71448	71454	71444	71444	I	0	“ It wo n’t work . ”
71463	71479	71455	71455	She	1176	“ You can read minds and predict the future . Maybe you ’re the witch ! ”
71514	71535	71506	71506	I	0	“ Enough . I ’m set in my ways and not going to change . Take me or leave me . ”
71536	71563	71564	71564	I	0	“ I never want you to change , Hutton . I ’ll always take you . I just wish you could see yourself like I do . ”
71739	71742	71743	71743	Felicity	151	“ Hutton . ”
71750	71762	71743	71743	Felicity	151	“ Tell me some of these guesses are way too high . ”
71768	71778	71763	71763	I	0	“ I ’m not even looking at that bullshit . ”
71828	71842	71843	71843	Felicity	151	“ Wow . People just say what they think , do n’t they ? ”
71854	71865	71843	71843	Felicity	151	“ How do you deal with this all the time ? ”
71878	71891	71866	71866	I	0	“ Fuck the internet . What would you like to do today ? ”
71892	71914	71915	71915	She	1176	“ I ’d love to sightsee a little bit , but will people be following us everywhere trying to get pictures ? ”
71920	71947	71915	71915	She	1176	“ I feel weird about that . I ’m not Zlatka , and people expect a supermodel , or at least someone with symmetrical hair and — ”
71948	71951	71952	71952	I	0	“ Hey . ”
71965	72002	71952	71952	I	0	“ I can not tell you how happy I am that you are not Zlatka . You are superior to her in every way . You are beautiful inside and out , and you are real . ”
72003	72006	72008	72008	her	1176	“ Thanks . ”
72013	72038	72008	72008	her	1176	“ I guess I ’m stupid . I did n’t foresee this problem . But why would a billionaire choose a girl like me ? ”
72080	72107	72073	72073	myself	0	“ Listen to me . You are way too good for every billionaire I ’ve ever met , and that includes me . Fuck those people . ”
72108	72130	72131	72131	I	0	“ I ’ve never worried about , like , leaving my house before . It ’s kind of a shitty feeling . ”
72143	72163	72131	72131	I	0	“ Being in the public eye is really fucking hard . Especially when you did n’t ask for it . ”
72164	72171	72073	72073	myself	0	“ How do you handle it ? ”
72172	72201	72202	72202	I	0	“ I do n’t leave the house much . But I ’m sorry I dragged you into this fucked - up orbit . I should have known better . ”
72205	72211	72202	72202	I	0	“ Want to head home ? ”
72241	72264	72265	72265	I	0	“ No . You ’re right — fuck those people . They ca n’t steal our joy . Our fake engagement joy . ”
72268	72272	72265	72265	I	0	“ Damn right . ”
72273	72282	72283	72283	she	1176	“ We ’re only here one more day , ”
72292	72308	72283	72283	she	1176	“ I want to do things . If we hide out , the jerks win . ”
72309	72332	72286	72286	her	1176	“ You tell me what you want to do , and I ’ll do it . Even if there ’s a crowd . ”
72333	72343	72286	72286	her	1176	“ Nothing too fancy . How about the zoo ? ”
72344	72347	72286	72286	her	1176	“ Done . ”
72348	72372	72286	72286	her	1176	“ But cancel the driver , okay ? Let ’s just walk . I do n’t want to call any attention to us . ”
72373	72377	72286	72286	her	1176	“ Good idea . ”
72414	72417	72418	72418	I	0	“ Ready ? ”
72434	72437	72428	72428	She	1176	“ Ready . ”

72541	72574	72575	72575	Her	1176	“ It ’s not because I do n’t love it or I feel strange wearing it . I just did n’t want anyone recognizing us . The ring seemed like a giveaway . ”

72618	72638	72639	72639	She	1176	“ You can wear it or not wear it whenever you want . That ring is yours , Felicity . ”
72642	72645	72639	72639	She	1176	“ Thanks . ”
72707	72711	72712	72712	I	0	“ Now what ? ”
72722	72725	72726	72726	She	1176	“ Shopping ? ”
72738	72751	72726	72726	She	1176	“ I ’d like to find a dress for our engagement party . ”
72752	72761	72726	72726	She	1176	“ That ’s what the internet is for . ”
72762	72770	72771	72771	she	1176	“ You do n’t have to come , ”
72776	72826	72771	72771	she	1176	“ You can go back to the hotel if you want and I ’ll meet you back there later . I get it — I’m not a huge shopper either , I just want to find something unique and stylish . Winnie told me to try NoLita or Soho . ”
72827	72832	72833	72833	I	0	“ It ’s fine . ”
72837	72843	72833	72833	I	0	“ I ’ll go shopping . ”
72844	72847	72848	72848	She	1176	“ Okay . ”
72864	72896	72897	72897	I	0	“ But to be clear , you are not buying me anything . Your job is just to stand there and tell me how things look when I try them on . ”
72900	72910	72897	72897	I	0	“ I have to go in to the stores ? ”
72911	72914	72969	72969	Felicity	151	“ Yes . ”
72915	72927	72897	72897	I	0	“ Is it too late to go back to the hotel ? ”
72928	72931	72932	72932	She	1176	“ Yes . ”
72947	72958	72940	72940	her	1176	“ But I promise it wo n’t be that bad . ”
73071	73076	73077	73077	I	0	“ It looks great , ”
73086	73092	73077	73077	I	0	“ You should get it . ”
73093	73104	73130	73130	her	1176	“ Hutton , you did n’t even look at it . ”
73105	73108	73109	73109	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
73122	73127	73128	73128	She	1176	“ I like it . ”
73136	73144	73128	73128	She	1176	“ What about it do you like ? ”
73145	73150	73151	73151	I	0	“ The . . . ”

73172	73178	73179	73179	I	0	“ Can I wait outside ? ”
73188	73191	73179	73179	I	0	“ Why ? ”
73192	73216	73217	73217	Felicity	151	“ Because I feel weird . People are staring . They think I ’m a pervert here to spy on women changing clothes . ”
73234	73240	73241	73241	I	0	“ Yeah . I know , ”
73247	73253	73244	73244	She	1176	“ You can wait outside . ”
73278	73287	73268	73268	She	1176	“ You did n’t want to buy it ? ”
73288	73291	73244	73244	She	1176	“ Nah . ”
73292	73296	73268	73268	She	1176	“ Why not ? ”
73297	73305	73306	73306	I	0	“ It was expensive , and I — ”
73313	73319	73306	73306	I	0	“ I ’ve got it . ”
73320	73325	73326	73326	She	1176	“ Hutton , no . ”
73331	73344	73326	73326	She	1176	“ It was n’t right anyway . I did n’t love it . ”
73345	73357	73306	73306	I	0	“ Are you sure ? Or are you just saying that ? ”
73358	73363	73364	73364	She	1176	“ I ’m sure . ”
73369	73378	73364	73364	She	1176	“ Come on , let ’s keep going . ”
73394	73399	73390	73390	she	1176	“ Oh , look . ”
73432	73438	73476	73476	her	1176	“ Are those wedding gowns ? ”
73439	73444	73445	73445	she	1176	“ I think so , ”
73449	73455	73445	73445	she	1176	“ Are n’t they pretty ? ”
73467	73473	73456	73456	I	0	“ Go try one on . ”
73479	73484	73476	73476	her	1176	“ I could n’t . ”
73485	73493	73445	73445	she	1176	“ Why not ? Just for fun . ”
73494	73507	73445	73445	she	1176	“ No , because what if I fall in love for real ? ”
73508	73515	73476	73476	her	1176	“ Would that be so bad ? ”
73516	73544	73445	73445	she	1176	“ Yes ! I do n’t want to try something on for fun , get my heart set on it , and then have to walk away . ”
73545	73550	73551	73551	I	0	“ You wo n’t , ”
73559	73563	73551	73551	I	0	“ Come on . ”
73564	73569	73570	73570	She	1176	“ Hutton , wait . ”
73588	73595	73572	73572	herself	1176	“ Why are we doing this ? ”
73596	73602	73551	73551	I	0	“ What do you mean ? ”
73603	73630	73631	73631	She	1176	“ The ring was one thing . Like you said , a symbol of our friendship . And it ’s something I can wear every day . ”
73640	73650	73631	73631	She	1176	“ I ’ll never wear one of those dresses . ”
73651	73657	73551	73551	I	0	“ How do you know ? ”
73658	73695	73551	73551	I	0	“ I guess I do n’t know for sure , but it seems like a good way to jinx myself — buy a wedding dress when I have no idea if I ’ll ever get married . ”
73722	73732	73717	73717	I	0	“ What about wearing it at our engagement party ? ”
73733	73738	73799	73799	Felicity	151	“ A wedding gown ? ”
73739	73756	73757	73757	She	1176	“ You do n’t have to get a big fluffy one . Get something more simple . ”
73764	73770	73757	73757	She	1176	“ I do n’t know . ”
73771	73780	73781	73781	I	0	“ Cosette Lavigne sounds like a French name , ”
73784	73798	73781	73781	I	0	“ Was n’t that what you told Mimi ? Your dress was French ? ”
73802	73808	73799	73799	Felicity	151	“ I did say that . ”
73809	73820	73821	73821	She	1176	“ Then it ’s meant to be . Come on . ”
73864	73872	73843	73852	A saleswoman with jet - black hair and chiseled cheekbones	1211	“ Hello . Can I help you ? ”
73890	73899	73900	73900	she	1176	“ I’m — I’m looking for a dress , ”
73909	73914	73906	73906	her	1787	“ A wedding dress ? ”
73915	73926	73927	73927	She	1787	“ No . I mean , yes , but no . ”
73938	73950	73927	73927	She	1787	“ Sorry . The dress would be for an engagement party . ”
73959	73972	73951	73952	The woman	1787	“ Wonderful . Congratulations . Did you have a style in mind ? ”
73973	74009	74055	74055	she	1787	“ Something a little more casual than what ’s in the window . White is fine , but no ball gown or long train or anything . The party is outdoors , on a patio . ”
74010	74022	74055	74055	she	1787	“ And will you need to leave with the dress today ? ”
74023	74026	74027	74027	she	1787	“ Yes , ”
74030	74047	74027	74027	she	1787	“ We ’re going home tomorrow . But if you do n’t have anything , I — ”
74063	74113	74055	74055	she	1787	“ I have something . We ’ll need to go off the rack , of course , but I ’m seeing something short , perhaps tulle with pearl beading , something to emphasize your waistline , maybe a full skirt , a statement sleeve . Give me a moment . ”
74114	74118	74119	74120	The woman	1787	“ Thank you . ”
74134	74143	74144	74144	I	0	“ What the hell is a statement sleeve ? ”
74147	74155	74144	74144	I	0	“ Is this dress going to talk ? ”
74156	74169	74119	74120	The woman	1787	“ I think it means the sleeves will be big and dramatic . ”
74170	74173	74144	74144	I	0	“ Interesting . ”
74260	74268	74269	74270	The saleswoman	1219	“ Like it was made for you . ”
74281	74295	74278	74278	her	1219	“ It does n’t even need alteration , I ca n’t believe it . ”
74296	74302	74303	74303	Felicity	151	“ It ’s so pretty , ”
74342	74362	74316	74316	She	1787	“ Let me see if I have a shoe for you to try on . What size are you ? ”
74363	74366	74368	74368	Felicity	151	“ Seven , ”
74370	74382	74368	74368	Felicity	151	“ But that ’s okay , I do n’t know if — ”
74383	74389	74390	74390	Olga	183	“ I ’ll be back . ”
74421	74427	74410	74410	I	0	“ What do you think ? ”
74428	74445	74446	74446	I	0	“ I think we should get out of here while we can . This is nuts . ”
74458	74465	74466	74466	I	0	“ Or it makes perfect sense , ”
74472	74479	74466	74466	I	0	“ Both things can be true . ”
74485	74495	74482	74482	her	1787	“ Not this time . It ’s too much . ”
74496	74501	74516	74516	She	1787	“ Too much money ? ”
74502	74508	74551	74551	I	0	“ Just — too much . ”
74509	74515	74516	74516	She	1787	“ What do you mean ? ”
74521	74548	74516	74516	She	1787	“ I guess I ’m getting nervous that the line between real and make - believe is growing a little blurry . Know what I mean ? ”
74586	74595	74596	74596	She	1787	“ Felicity , it ’s just a dress . ”
74606	74610	74596	74596	She	1787	“ Is it ? ”
74620	74623	74616	74616	I	0	“ Yes . ”
74666	74669	74652	74652	she	1787	“ Shoot ! ”
74689	74696	74697	74697	she	1787	“ Get the dress off me ! ”
74760	74767	74768	74768	I	0	“ She has a bloody nose , ”
74771	74776	74777	74777	Olga	183	“ Can you help ? ”
74811	74818	74819	74819	Felicity	151	“ Should I call an ambulance ? ”
74824	74831	74833	74833	her	1222	“ It ’s not that bad , ”
74837	74844	74821	74821	her	1222	“ I can wait it out . ”
74845	74848	74849	74849	I	0	“ No , ”
74853	74864	74849	74849	I	0	“ She ’ll be fine . Is the dress okay ? ”
74865	74870	74871	74871	She	1222	“ I think so . ”
74878	74908	74871	74871	She	1222	“ No ! There is a spot of blood right here on the neckline ! It ’s faint , but I can see it . The dress is ruined . ”
74914	74924	74909	74909	I	0	“ Then I guess we have to buy it . ”
74928	74933	74936	74936	me	0	“ I ’m sorry . ”
74991	74996	74997	74997	I	0	“ Do n’t be . ”
75004	75011	74997	74997	I	0	“ This dress was too expensive . ”
75012	75018	75064	75064	She	1222	“ It ’s worth it . ”
75019	75028	74997	74997	I	0	“ I bled all over your white shirt . ”
75029	75039	74997	74997	I	0	“ That ’s why I bought a black one . ”
75040	75046	75064	75064	She	1222	“ I ’m so embarrassed . ”
75047	75059	74997	74997	I	0	“ You never have to be embarrassed in front of me . ”
75060	75063	75064	75064	She	1222	“ No ? ”
75070	75103	75064	75064	She	1222	“ No . I guarantee I ’ve made a way bigger fool of myself . Did I ever tell you about my road test when I was getting my driver ’s license ? ”
75109	75141	75142	75142	She	1222	“ I had such a bad panic attack , I had to stop the car , get out , and walk home . It took me another month to try again . ”
75150	75156	75142	75142	She	1222	“ I never knew that . ”
75157	75206	75280	75280	her	1222	“ I was too ashamed to tell you . Then there was the time I took an F on a presentation in a college class because I got up to give it but instead of going to the front of the room , I walked out the door . ”
75207	75219	75142	75142	She	1222	“ The teacher did n’t offer to let you redo it ? ”
75220	75250	75251	75251	Her	1222	“ Sure he did . I said no way . And then there was this girl I was kind of crazy about — I totally blew it with her . ”
75256	75260	75251	75251	Her	1222	“ What girl ? ”
75261	75275	75276	75276	She	1222	“ This crazy smart , smokin ’ hot babe in the Chemistry Club . ”
75284	75292	75276	75276	She	1222	“ Yeah ? What did you do ? ”
75293	75324	75142	75142	She	1222	“ I worked up my nerve to ask her to the prom , but at the end of the night , I fucking shook her hand instead of kissing her . ”
75325	75332	75251	75251	Her	1222	“ Why ’d you do that ? ”
75333	75352	75276	75276	She	1222	“ I was scared . I never thought she ’d want to be with a guy like me . ”
75353	75365	75142	75142	She	1222	“ Smart ? Handsome ? Section leader of the marching band ? ”
75366	75376	75251	75251	Her	1222	“ I was a nerd with a filthy mind . ”
75377	75386	75387	75387	She	1222	“ That ’s the best kind of nerd . ”
75395	75411	75387	75387	She	1222	“ You should reach out . See if she ’ll give you a second chance . ”
75412	75417	75387	75387	She	1222	“ You think so ? ”
75418	75421	75387	75387	She	1222	“ Definitely . ”
75507	75514	75515	75515	Felicity	151	“ He ’s carrying her purse , ”
75518	75524	75515	75515	Felicity	151	“ How cute is that ? ”
75555	75559	75561	75562	the man	459	“ Thank you , ”
75581	75585	75586	75586	Felicity	151	“ Of course . ”
75594	75604	75586	75586	Felicity	151	“ It ’s a beautiful day for a walk . ”
75605	75622	75624	75625	the woman	1787	“ Yes . We ’ve walked in this park just about every Saturday for seventy years , ”
75631	75644	75628	75628	she	1787	“ I just ca n’t get as far as I used to . ”
75648	75656	75628	75628	she	1787	“ That ’s what benches are for . ”
75657	75664	75665	75665	she	1787	“ But it ’s our anniversary , ”
75669	75684	75665	75665	she	1787	“ and I said , ‘ Edward , we have to walk today . ’ ”
75685	75689	75691	75691	Felicity	151	“ Happy anniversary ! ”
75693	75698	75691	75691	Felicity	151	“ How many years ? ”
75699	75721	75722	75723	the woman	1787	“ Seventy - two . We moved here when I was expecting our first baby . We had eight of them , ”
75730	75743	75727	75727	Felicity	151	“ That ’s a lot of years and a lot of babies . ”
75744	75750	75752	75752	Edward	186	“ Tell me about it , ”
75762	75770	75755	75755	he	186	“ How ’s the hip , Clara ? ”
75771	75783	75784	75784	She	1787	“ A little rusty . I ’ll just rest a minute . ”
75794	75800	75784	75784	She	1787	“ Are you two married ? ”
75820	75823	75824	75824	I	0	“ No , ”
75827	75835	75837	75837	Felicity	151	“ We ’re just very close friends , ”
75839	75848	75849	75849	Clara	187	“ It ’s so much harder these days , ”
75855	75894	75849	75849	Clara	187	“ Especially for women . The list of things my daughters and granddaughters wanted to accomplish before they got married was a mile long . But finding love is an accomplishment too . That ’s my two cents . ”
75900	75909	75895	75895	Edward	186	“ She ’s got two cents for everything . ”
75910	75926	75928	75929	his wife	680	“ I ’m ninety - three . I ’ve saved up a lot of pennies , ”
75932	75941	75928	75929	his wife	680	“ Well , I think you ’re right . ”
75949	75956	75942	75942	Felicity	151	“ Finding love is an accomplishment . ”
75957	75966	75967	75967	Clara	187	“ Holding onto it is n’t easy either , ”
75971	76015	75967	75967	Clara	187	“ People make such a fuss about weddings these days , I think they forget that after the white dress and the I do ’s , there ’s a whole lot of hard work ahead . But that ’s just my two cents . ”
76016	76022	76024	76024	Edward	186	“ See what I mean ? ”
76029	76045	76047	76047	Clara	187	“ Anyway , I think the best marriages are the ones between two close friends , ”
76049	76106	76107	76107	Felicity	151	“ That ’s what I was trying to say . Those are the ones that last , because you already know each other so well . You get along with each other . You appreciate things about the other person that you might not if it was just S - E - X all the time . ”
76113	76122	76107	76107	Felicity	151	“ Yes , I know what you mean . ”
76123	76133	76134	76134	Clara	187	“ Of course , if you can have both , ”
76139	76183	76134	76134	Clara	187	“ that ’s really the best of both worlds . If you can find that close friend that you love and trust , and the S - E - X is good too , that ’s when you know . Right , Eddie ? ”
76184	76187	76188	76188	He	1244	“ Right . ”
76195	76213	76214	76214	Edward	186	“ Because one might fade , but the other ? Never . That ’s my two cents . ”
76217	76221	76222	76222	Felicity	151	“ Thank you , ”
76225	76230	76222	76222	Felicity	151	“ And happy anniversary . ”
76274	76278	76281	76281	her	1249	“ Everything okay ? ”
76294	76302	76279	76279	I	0	“ Yes . I ’m just tired . ”
76303	76315	76316	76316	I	0	“ Are you too tired for S - E - X ? ”
76326	76329	76323	76323	She	1249	“ No . ”
76353	76356	76331	76331	she	1249	“ Hey . ”
76375	76381	76382	76382	She	1249	“ What ’s going on ? ”
76409	76422	76398	76398	she	1249	“ I keep thinking about that couple . Seventy - two years . ”
76423	76430	76389	76389	her	1249	“ That ’s a long time . ”
76431	76465	76466	76466	She	1249	“ I think about your parents . My dad and Frannie . Your sister and Neil . Even Winnie and Dex — you can just tell they ’re going to be together forever . ”
76472	76490	76466	76466	She	1249	“ How do some people get so lucky , and others just . . . do n’t ? ”
76491	76500	76389	76389	her	1249	“ Born under different stars , I guess . ”
76501	76505	76506	76506	she	1249	“ I guess , ”
76510	76536	76506	76506	she	1249	“ Hey , listen . Our stars might not come with seven - plus decades and eight kids , but they ’re not so bad . ”
76542	76545	76537	76537	She	1249	“ No . ”
76556	76567	76546	76546	I	0	“ What do you say we do this every year ? ”
76568	76572	76389	76389	her	1249	“ Do what ? ”
76573	76643	76546	76546	I	0	“ Meet up for a weekend in New York — or anywhere else in the world . I ’ll pick you up in a jet , we ’ll rent a hotel suite , eat at fancy places , see shows , go shopping , or even better , avoid people and do nothing at all . Just . . . be together . Like this . You and me . ”
76644	76649	76674	76674	her	1249	“ That sounds nice . ”
76656	76663	76674	76674	her	1249	“ You sure you ’re okay ? ”
76664	76669	76546	76546	I	0	“ I ’m fine . ”
77000	77009	77011	77011	Winnie	89	“ Nooooo ! You and those bloody noses ! ”
77013	77019	77011	77011	Winnie	89	“ Is the dress ruined ? ”
77020	77024	77025	77025	I	0	“ Not really , ”
77028	77036	77025	77025	I	0	“ You can hardly see the spot . ”
77037	77055	77057	77057	Millie	83	“ I love that you had one fancy day and one day just dressed down for yourselves , ”
77062	77074	77059	77059	I	0	“ Me too . We had so much fun both nights . ”
77075	77081	77082	77082	Millie	83	“ I bet you did . ”
77107	77119	77099	77099	she	1255	“ What ’s that look ? What do n’t I know ? ”
77120	77137	77099	77099	she	1255	“ I was just wondering if Felicity had to use a safe word in New York . ”
77144	77151	77138	77138	Winnie	89	“ Oh my God . What ? ”
77152	77158	77159	77159	Millie	83	“ Did n’t you know ? ”
77165	77171	77159	77159	Millie	83	“ Hutton has a kink . ”
77185	77209	77177	77177	she	89	“ I can not believe you have been withholding this information from me , and I demand that you tell me everything immediately . ”
77222	77236	77210	77210	I	0	“ Listen . Do I ask you everything about Dex in the bedroom ? ”
77237	77247	77248	77248	I	0	“ No , but I tell you everything anyway . ”
77251	77265	77248	77248	I	0	“ Well , I ’m not like that . Some things are private . ”
77286	77295	77277	77277	Millie	83	“ At least one little detail , please ? ”
77309	77327	77328	77328	Millie	83	“ I did have a safe word . Although I do n’t think I used it correctly . ”
77333	77342	77343	77343	Winnie	89	“ Whatever you did , was it fun ? ”
77347	77353	77343	77343	Winnie	89	“ Did you like it ? ”
77354	77357	77358	77358	I	0	“ Yeah , ”
77361	77397	77358	77358	I	0	“ It was hot . I mean , I can see why some people would not like it , and it definitely takes a certain level of trust , but we had a good time . ”
77398	77407	77408	77408	Winnie	89	“ And he ’s okay with the party ? ”
77415	77418	77419	77419	Millie	83	“ Winnie ! ”
77426	77435	77419	77419	Millie	83	“ That is supposed to be a surprise . ”
77436	77439	77440	77440	Winnie	89	“ Ow ! ”
77445	77459	77440	77440	Winnie	89	“ She already knows , okay ? She dragged it out of me . ”
77460	77470	77471	77471	I	0	“ It was like shooting fish in a barrel . ”
77474	77497	77471	77471	I	0	“ But I was glad she told me . I ca n’t say he ’s thrilled , but we ’ll be there . ”
77498	77506	77440	77440	Winnie	89	“ And what about a wedding date ? ”
77512	77517	77507	77507	Winnie	89	“ Any progress there ? ”
77518	77531	77532	77532	Millie	83	“ There ’s one Sunday afternoon available at the end of August , ”
77540	77548	77532	77532	Millie	83	“ I have it reserved for now . ”
77549	77554	77555	77555	I	0	“ Thanks , Millie , ”
77558	77573	77555	77555	I	0	“ I promise to get you an answer in the next day or so . ”
77574	77592	77532	77532	Millie	83	“ I hope so ! Invitations need to go out — that ’s only a month away . ”
77598	77629	77630	77630	I	0	“ Shoot . I have to go , I promised Hallie and Luna I ’d go swimming with them at eleven . Let me see the ring one more time ! ”
77646	77666	77637	77637	she	89	“ It ’s so beautiful . I ’m so happy for you . When do we talk bridesmaid dresses ? ”
77667	77672	77705	77705	her	83	“ Uh . Soon . ”
77673	77676	77637	77637	she	89	“ Yay ! ”
77691	77698	77705	77705	her	83	“ Okay , I ’m going . ”
77710	77713	77705	77705	her	83	“ What ? ”
77714	77724	77725	77725	She	83	“ A real wedding dress ? A real ring ? ”
77730	77755	77727	77727	her	83	“ What ’s going on ? I ’m starting to wonder if the joke ’s on me . Maybe I should save the date . ”
77756	77770	77771	77771	I	0	“ We had to buy the dress because my nose bled on it , ”
77774	77799	77771	77771	I	0	“ It does n’t really look like a wedding gown . Just a party dress . And I even tried to pay for it . ”
77800	77806	77727	77727	her	83	“ What about the ring ? ”
77807	77815	77816	77816	I	0	“ The ring was just a gift , ”
77829	77833	77816	77816	I	0	“ A gift . ”
77839	77843	77834	77834	Millie	83	“ From Tiffany . ”
77844	77908	77727	77727	her	83	“ Yes . Look , I know it ’s a bit extravagant , and I told him that , but he would n’t listen . He said he knows diamond rings are normally reserved for people you ’re asking to spend the rest of your life with , but since he knows he always wants me in his life , it ’s fine . ”
77918	77931	77909	77909	I	0	“ We ’re not really getting married , and it ’s fine . ”
77932	77937	77727	77727	her	83	“ It ’s fine ? ”
77938	77947	77909	77909	I	0	“ It ’s fine . I ’m fine . ”
77973	77985	77959	77959	Millie	83	“ I do n’t think you are . What ’s wrong ? ”
77986	77989	77990	77990	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
78002	78027	77990	77990	I	0	“ I ’m tired is all . I did n’t get much sleep in New York , and I had to work last night . ”
78054	78057	78058	78058	I	0	“ What ? ”
78066	78078	78058	78058	I	0	“ I know you . Something has you nervous . Jumpy . ”
78079	78084	78085	78085	I	0	“ That ’s ridiculous . ”
78103	78114	78091	78091	She	238	“ Did Hutton tell you he loves you or something ? ”
78115	78118	78119	78119	I	0	“ No ! ”
78129	78158	78119	78119	I	0	“ Things are n’t like that with us . This is n’t a real relationship or a real engagement . It ’s something I made up , remember ? ”
78164	78168	78161	78161	her	83	“ I remember . ”
78208	78243	78190	78191	a woman	376	“ I know it might look real on the outside , but that ’s just because we ’re having a good time . It ’s one hundred percent fake . We are not together . ”
78244	78250	78251	78251	she	376	“ If you say so , ”
78254	78258	78251	78251	she	376	“ I do . ”
78269	78275	78251	78251	she	376	“ It ’s not real . ”
78444	78454	78416	78416	Mimi	92	“ the hometown honey that bagged herself a billionaire . ”
78631	78636	78637	78637	he	151	“ I ’m sorry , ”
78640	78687	78637	78637	he	151	“ It will seem like I do n’t care or like I ’m self - obsessed , but that ’s not it . When something like this is hanging over my head , I just get really focused . I ca n’t think about anything else . ”
78688	78693	78694	78694	I	0	“ I get it , ”
78698	78715	78694	78694	I	0	“ And you do n’t have to apologize or worry about me . Concentrate on you . ”
78933	79012	78920	78920	I	0	“ Felicity , darling , it ’s Mom . I heard the big news ! At first I just could n’t believe it — it seemed so unlikely for you — but I ’ve seen the photos and do n’t you two look cute together ? And wow , a billionaire . That ’s really something . I ’m sure your father is happy about that . He ’ll never have to worry about money again , right ? ”
79018	79040	78920	78920	I	0	“ Anyway , I ’m dying to talk to you . Give me a call , it ’s been too long . ”
79070	79075	79076	79076	I	0	“ Not long enough , ”
79102	79105	79106	79106	I	0	“ Nothing , ”
79131	79144	79115	79115	I	0	“ You ’ve been so quiet tonight . Actually , all week . ”
79145	79151	79152	79152	I	0	“ Have I ? Sorry . ”
79168	79175	79152	79152	I	0	“ Just tired , I guess . ”
79176	79179	79180	79180	He	151	“ Hey . ”
79200	79221	79180	79180	He	151	“ Talk to me . I know I ’m distracted with work , but I ’m still here for you . ”
79289	79297	79298	79298	She	127	“ It ’s nothing . I promise . ”
79331	79343	79344	79344	she	127	“ I just ca n’t wait to meet a real billionaire , ”
79347	79378	79344	79344	she	127	“ And I ’m dying to see that rock up close . It looks huge . Is he paying for out - of - town guests to stay somewhere nice ? ”
79507	79510	79498	79498	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
79511	79514	79515	79515	Carla	127	“ Finally , ”
79524	79535	79515	79515	Carla	127	“ I was wondering when I ’d actually get you . ”
79545	79551	79538	79538	I	0	“ What do you want ? ”
79552	79558	79515	79515	Carla	127	“ I want to talk . ”
79559	79563	79498	79498	I	0	“ About what ? ”
79564	79568	79569	79569	She	89	“ About life . ”
79573	79593	79569	79569	She	89	“ About this wedding thing . Why would you want to get married anyway ? You ’re too young . ”
79594	79604	79498	79498	I	0	“ Do you even know how old I am ? ”
79605	79611	79612	79612	she	89	“ Do n’t be rude , ”
79615	79622	79612	79612	she	89	“ I ’m still your mother . ”
79623	79630	79498	79498	I	0	“ When did you decide that ? ”
79631	79667	79668	79668	My	0	“ Hey . I ’m trynna do you a favor . I get wanting the money , but make sure he signs a prenup . You need to protect yourself for when he leaves you . ”
79672	79680	79668	79668	My	0	“ I do n’t need a prenup . ”
79681	79687	79688	79688	she	89	“ Yes , you do , ”
79691	79728	79688	79688	she	89	“ You think everything will be wine and roses , but it wo n’t . The good times do n’t last . He ’ll make promises he wo n’t keep , just like your father did . ”
79729	79737	79738	79738	I	0	“ You leave Dad out of this , ”
79742	79766	79738	79738	I	0	“ He ’s never broken a promise to me my entire life . And I bet he never broke one to you either ! ”
79767	79787	79788	79788	she	1286	“ He promised to love me . Instead he drove me away . He took my children from me , ”
79791	79797	79798	79798	I	0	“ Leaving was your choice , ”
79802	79815	79798	79798	I	0	“ You betrayed Dad . You betrayed Millie and Winnie and me . ”
79820	79837	79816	79816	She	1286	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about . You do n’t know anything . ”
79838	79843	79844	79844	I	0	“ I know enough , ”
79968	79971	79972	79972	he	151	“ Hi , ”
80039	80044	80021	80021	He	151	“ Be right back . ”
80157	80160	80147	80147	I	0	“ Felicity ? ”
80180	80183	80184	80184	I	0	“ Felicity . ”
80198	80201	80184	80184	I	0	“ What ? ”
80202	80208	80218	80218	He	1291	“ What are you doing ? ”
80209	80212	80213	80213	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
80226	80235	80218	80218	He	1291	“ Were you going to cut your hair ? ”
80292	80301	80284	80284	he	1291	“ Want to tell me what ’s up ? ”
80302	80305	80306	80306	I	0	“ No . ”
80317	80321	80306	80306	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
80322	80365	80284	80284	he	1291	“ Because you ’re busy and need to concentrate on work , not my bullshit . The entire point of this arrangement was for you to have time and space to work , and I do n’t want to be a burden . ”
80366	80414	80415	80415	He	1291	“ You are not a burden . Do I need to remind you how we promised to be there for each other when one of us needed a friend ? I know you did n’t use the code , but I ’m sensing the bat signal here . ”
80420	80432	80415	80415	He	1291	“ Those scissors are a cry for help . Now talk . ”
80438	80443	80433	80433	I	0	“ My mother called . ”
80444	80447	80455	80455	him	1291	“ Oh . ”
80485	80491	80492	80492	I	0	“ After all this time , ”
80503	80512	80492	80492	I	0	“ Why should she still have that power ? ”
80513	80527	80528	80528	he	1291	“ Because she ’s your mother and what she did left a scar , ”
80531	80546	80528	80528	he	1291	“ But I do n’t need her . I do n’t even like her . ”
80556	80565	80547	80547	I	0	“ Why should it matter what she says ? ”
80566	80617	80492	80492	I	0	“ Maybe it does n’t matter whether you need her or like her . Maybe just the fact that deep down , you know she was your mother and was supposed to love and protect you , and instead she hurt you , is enough to fuck with your head . ”
80618	80621	80622	80622	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
80628	80632	80622	80622	I	0	“ I guess . ”
80633	80642	80643	80643	he	1293	“ Maybe you should talk to my sister , ”
80646	80673	80643	80643	he	1293	“ Or she could give you the name of someone else . While I am an expert at head fuckery , I ’m not a therapist . ”
80682	80689	80690	80690	He	1293	“ Look at you promoting therapy . ”
80693	80739	80690	80690	He	1293	“ Just because it did n’t solve my issues does n’t mean it ca n’t help you with yours . My shit is my own fault . Your shit was done to you — I bet a good therapist could help you work through it . ”
80740	80785	80786	80786	He	1293	“ Maybe . But how do you ever work through the fact that your own mother did n’t want you ? Or love you enough ? It ’s like this stupid voice in the back of my head that I ca n’t turn off . ”
80792	80813	80786	80786	He	1293	“ I wish I had a good answer . I ca n’t turn off the voices in my head either . ”
80839	80854	80836	80836	his	1293	“ Thanks for chasing me in here . I guess I did need you . ”
80855	80863	80864	80864	He	1293	“ I like when you need me . ”
80879	80886	80876	80876	him	1293	“ I wish things were different . ”
80887	80891	80836	80836	his	1293	“ Different how ? ”
80892	80898	80899	80899	He	1293	“ All kinds of ways . ”
80902	80912	80899	80899	He	1293	“ I wish I had my magic powers back . ”
80916	80923	80913	80913	I	0	“ You ’re enough without them . ”
80924	80931	80932	80932	I	0	“ What would you wish for ? ”
81085	81107	81108	81108	I	0	“ I ’d wish for some ice cream , a bubble bath , and an orgasm — probably in that order , ”
81118	81125	81112	81112	He	1293	“ Now that I can deliver . ”
81831	81834	81824	81824	her	1298	“ Hey . ”
81835	81871	81820	81820	Her	1298	“ Hey . I ’m heading to my sister ’s to hang out with the kids for a while . You want to come with me ? I can wait for you to get dressed . ”
81872	81877	81878	81878	She	1298	“ I ca n’t . ”
81889	81908	81878	81878	She	1298	“ I ’m behind on a bunch of things , and I have to work at Etoile tonight . ”
81909	81912	81913	81913	I	0	“ Okay . ”
81930	81936	81913	81913	I	0	“ So I was thinking . ”
81937	81941	81878	81878	She	1298	“ About what ? ”
81942	81954	81955	81955	She	1298	“ I have to be out of here by August fifteenth . ”
81962	81976	81955	81955	She	1298	“ I know . It ’s okay . I ’ll move back home . ”
81977	81987	81878	81878	She	1298	“ Why do n’t I rent you another place ? ”
81988	81994	81995	81995	She	1298	“ Rent me another place ? ”
82015	82043	81995	81995	She	1298	“ Well . . . yeah . That way you do n’t have to move back in with your parents when I go back to San Francisco . ”
82044	82062	81878	81878	She	1298	“ So you would n’t live in the new place ? It would just be for me ? ”
82063	82080	82081	82081	I	0	“ Right . But I ’d have a place to stay when I came to visit . ”
82087	82116	82081	82081	I	0	“ You can stock the kitchen with everything you like . You can take all the things I bought for here and keep them in the new place . ”
82123	82145	82118	82118	she	1298	“ That wo n’t make sense , Hutton . We ’re supposed to break things off after the party , remember ? ”
82146	82155	82156	82156	I	0	“ I ’ve been thinking about that too . ”
82161	82191	82156	82156	I	0	“ Maybe we do n’t have to break things off entirely . Maybe we just say we ’ve decided not to get married , but we ’re still together . ”
82192	82209	82210	82210	I	0	“ We ’re still together , but you live in San Francisco and I live here ? ”
82220	82237	82238	82238	She	1298	“ I know it ’s not ideal , but it ’s better than nothing , right ? ”
82248	82255	82238	82238	She	1298	“ Better than nothing . Right . ”
82256	82265	82266	82266	I	0	“ Maybe we should talk about this later , ”
82269	82286	82266	82266	I	0	“ You ’re not fully awake yet , and I kind of ambushed you with this . ”
82287	82296	82238	82238	She	1298	“ I ’m awake enough to say no . ”
82297	82300	82301	82301	She	1298	“ Huh ? ”
82306	82331	82301	82301	She	1298	“ No . I do n’t want you to rent me another place . I do n’t want to be together but never together . ”
82332	82343	82238	82238	She	1298	“ So you ’d rather just break it off completely ? ”
82344	82349	82369	82369	she	1298	“ No , but — ”
82350	82357	82358	82358	I	0	“ Because those are the options , ”
82386	82396	82381	82381	she	1298	“ Those are the options ? Something or nothing ? ”
82397	82400	82401	82401	She	1298	“ Yes . ”
82405	82413	82401	82401	She	1298	“ Then I guess it ’s nothing . ”
82414	82426	82427	82427	I	0	“ Felicity , come on . We ’ve talked about this . ”
82436	82450	82427	82427	I	0	“ I ’ve never been dishonest with you about what I can offer . ”
82451	82455	82456	82456	Her	1298	“ I know . ”
82460	82488	82456	82456	Her	1298	“ And I ’ll be honest with you now , and say that what you have to offer is n’t enough for me . I ’m sorry . ”
82489	82493	82494	82494	I	0	“ We agreed , ”
82498	82520	82494	82494	I	0	“ We agreed that it ’s foolish to jump into the deep end of the pool when you ca n’t swim . ”
82521	82529	82530	82530	Her	1298	“ I did n’t jump , Hutton . ”
82534	82538	82530	82530	Her	1298	“ I fell . ”
82559	82570	82548	82548	I	0	“ You ’re asking for something I ca n’t give . ”
82571	82579	82580	82580	She	1298	“ I ’m not asking for anything . ”
82588	82618	82580	82580	She	1298	“ You know , I ’ve spent years being terrified of this very situation . Years of being careful with my heart so I would n’t ever be rejected . ”
82619	82624	82548	82548	I	0	“ Felicity . Stop . ”
82641	82649	82650	82650	she	1298	“ I thought I was so smart , ”
82653	82682	82650	82650	she	1298	“ But here I am anyway . And even though I wo n’t ask for what I want , I wo n’t settle for less than I deserve . ”
83641	83648	83634	83634	She	83	“ Oh no . More bangs . ”
83671	83703	83657	83657	she	83	“ Shhhh , it ’s okay . They ’re a little extreme , but at least they ’re even . . . ish . Did you cut any off the back ? ”
83704	83707	83708	83708	I	0	“ No , ”
83711	83718	83708	83708	I	0	“ I stopped myself for once . ”
83719	83723	83724	83724	She	83	“ Good girl . ”
83747	83756	83724	83724	She	83	“ Got time for some tea or lemonade ? ”
83757	83763	83766	83766	her	83	“ Yes . Thank you . ”
83803	83806	83807	83807	Millie	83	“ Here . ”
83819	83849	83807	83807	Millie	83	“ I ’d open some wine or something , but it looks like you have to work , and something tells me we ’d kill that bottle pretty fast . ”
83850	83859	83860	83860	She	83	“ Yeah . I better stick to lemonade . ”
83878	83885	83870	83870	herself	83	“ So what ’s going on ? ”
83886	83894	83895	83895	I	0	“ It ’s this thing with Hutton , ”
83902	83911	83912	83912	She	83	“ I think it might have turned real . ”
83930	83937	83938	83938	I	0	“ It did n’t start real , ”
83942	83988	83938	83938	I	0	“ It was all an act . A way for me to save face in front of Mimi Pepper - Peabody and for Hutton to get his mother off his back . Plus , I got to move out of Dad and Frannie ’s house . ”
83989	84008	84009	84009	Millie	83	“ You know , both Winnie and I said you could move in with us , just saying , ”
84013	84020	84021	84021	I	0	“ That is n’t the point , ”
84025	84035	84021	84021	I	0	“ Of course not . Sorry . Go on . ”
84041	84064	84036	84036	I	0	“ Everything was fine until we got to New York . That ’s where I started to get . . . confused . ”
84065	84071	84072	84072	she	83	“ Ca n’t imagine why , ”
84082	84091	84072	84072	she	83	“ I was overwhelmed by the . . . ”
84102	84158	84092	84092	I	0	“ Whirlwind of fantasy . It ’s not easy to keep your feet on the ground when your head is in the clouds , you know ? I was never the girl who dreamed about being the princess , but Hutton just has this way of making me feel so beautiful and special and deserving . ”
84159	84165	84166	84166	Millie	83	“ You are , Felicity . ”
84172	84178	84166	84166	Millie	83	“ Do n’t doubt that . ”
84188	84247	84248	84248	Millie	83	“ I do n’t know what to do , Millie . Hutton is the only guy I ’ve ever felt this close to . The one guy on the planet who gets me , who ’s seen me at my best and worst , who knows the crazy inner workings of my mind and does n’t judge me . ”
84268	84290	84253	84253	her	83	“ Are you listening to yourself ? The one guy , the only guy ? You ’re in love with Hutton . ”
84291	84294	84295	84295	I	0	“ Shhhhhhhh ! ”
84309	84315	84295	84295	I	0	“ Do n’t say it ! ”
84316	84396	84397	84397	She	83	“ Why not ? I feel like that ’s the one thing that ’s been said in this kitchen in the last couple weeks that makes any sense at all . This whole fake fiancé routine is insane . You guys love each other . You ’re good together . The whole reason people swallowed your whole cockamamie story to begin with is because it ’s so obvious to those around you that you two are meant to be . ”
84402	84432	84399	84399	her	83	“ I know you ’ve got some weird allergy to love , which I have never fully understood , but it ’s time to get over it , Felicity . ”
84442	84460	84433	84433	I	0	“ You want to know why I have an allergy to love ? I ’ll tell you . ”
84469	84474	84461	84461	She	83	“ Yes . Please . ”
84509	84539	84499	84499	I	0	“ When I was six , I overheard the fight Dad and Mom had the night she told him she was leaving . She said she never wanted us . ”
84546	84551	84540	84540	Millie	83	“ Oh my God . ”
84552	84563	84571	84571	I	0	“ But that ’s not all I heard her say . ”
84590	84599	84600	84600	My	0	“ And within days , she was gone . ”
84611	84630	84607	84607	her	83	“ Why did n’t you say something about what you ’d heard ? To me or to Dad ? ”
84631	84642	84643	84643	I	0	“ I did n’t want anyone else to be hurt , ”
84646	84680	84643	84643	I	0	“ What she said meant she did n’t want you or Winnie either . And I knew I was n’t supposed to be listening . I was worried I might get in trouble . ”
84710	84719	84699	84699	she	83	“ Sorry , I ’m out of tissues . ”
84720	84730	84731	84731	I	0	“ I ’m not going to cry over this , ”
84735	84739	84731	84731	I	0	“ I am . ”
84758	84764	84740	84740	She	83	“ Millie , do n’t . ”
84775	84794	84740	84740	She	83	“ She does n’t deserve your tears . I ’m sorry , I should n’t have told you . ”
84795	84809	84810	84810	she	83	“ I ’m not crying about her . I ’m crying about you , ”
84817	84831	84810	84810	she	83	“ Carrying that around all these years and never saying anything about it . ”
84840	84852	84810	84810	she	83	“ It was a long time ago . I ’m fine . ”
84853	84860	84861	84861	she	83	“ No , you ’re not ! ”
84875	84905	84861	84861	she	83	“ You ’re totally messed up over it . Now I understand why you left your relationships when someone told you they loved you . You never believed them . ”
84906	84912	84913	84913	I	0	“ Even if I did , ”
84920	84953	84913	84913	I	0	“ it would n’t matter in the end . People can love you one day and not the next . You wo n’t even know what you did until they ’re gone . ”
84954	84959	84861	84861	she	83	“ Oh , Felicity . ”
84971	85014	84968	84968	her	83	“ Mom did n’t leave because of something you did . She left because she met someone else . She ran off with some other guy . She did it to get back at Dad for not paying enough attention to her . ”
85015	85028	85029	85029	I	0	“ But if she really loved us , she ’d have stayed , ”
85032	85038	85029	85029	I	0	“ Maybe , maybe not . ”
85054	85094	85046	85046	her	83	“ Some people are just bad at love , you know ? They ’re too selfish or narcissistic , or deep down they do n’t love themselves , so they do n’t know how to accept it from others . ”
85104	85117	85118	85118	Millie	83	“ Do you think some people just are n’t wired for love ? ”
85126	85157	85118	85118	Millie	83	“ Me , personally ? No . I think some people choose to behave in ways that keep them closed off from it , but I think everyone is capable . ”
85168	85191	85118	85118	Millie	83	“ Hutton says he ’s not wired for love , because of his anxiety . He thinks he ’s better off alone . ”
85192	85208	85209	85209	My	0	“ People say a lot of things they do n’t mean when they ’re scared . ”
85219	85236	85213	85213	I	0	“ That ’s what I mean ! You ca n’t trust people to tell the truth ! ”
85237	85250	85118	85118	Millie	83	“ Does Hutton know how you feel ? Did you tell him ? ”
85251	85259	85118	85118	Millie	83	“ No , but I implied it . ”
85260	85263	85264	85264	She	1342	“ Felicity . ”
85272	85317	85264	85264	She	1342	“ Tell him the truth about your feelings . I ’m not saying you have to get engaged or married or even keep living together . But why not at least be honest ? What if hearing the words is the push he needs ? ”
85323	85335	85318	85318	I	0	“ He does n’t want to hear those words from me . ”
85336	85343	85118	85118	Millie	83	“ But you just told me — ”
85344	85373	85264	85264	She	1342	“ I ’m not done . He has to be out of the house two weeks after the party . Our plan was to end things by then . ”
85374	85380	85381	85381	she	1342	“ I remember the plan , ”
85385	85431	85381	85381	she	1342	“ But then this morning he comes into the bedroom with a new plan . He said maybe he ’ll rent another place here and I can live in it . This way he ’ll have a place to stay when he comes to town . ”
85440	85443	85437	85437	her	83	“ What ? ”
85444	85454	85455	85455	I	0	“ He wants to keep me like a pet , ”
85462	85468	85455	85455	I	0	“ This makes no sense . ”
85474	85485	85469	85469	Millie	83	“ Why would he say that ? He loves you . ”
85486	85490	85491	85491	I	0	“ Not enough , ”
85516	85526	85511	85511	I	0	“ Jesus Christ , this woman is so annoying ! ”
85527	85531	85469	85469	Millie	83	“ Carla again ? ”
85532	85550	85551	85551	I	0	“ No , fucking Mimi Pepper - Peabody . She keeps wanting to meet up with me . ”
85556	85596	85551	85551	I	0	“ Now she ’s making threats . This one says ‘ If I do n’t hear from you within twenty - four hours , you wo n’t have a chance to tell me your side of the story . ’ ”
85597	85605	85469	85469	Millie	83	“ What the hell does that mean ? ”
85606	85617	85551	85551	I	0	“ I have no idea . I ’m fucking exhausted . ”
85631	85640	85623	85623	I	0	“ But I have to go to work . ”
85641	85658	85659	85659	She	1343	“ Me too . I ’m sorry — I feel like I was n’t much help . ”
85666	85673	85659	85659	She	1343	“ Want to hang out tomorrow ? ”
85674	85682	85683	85683	I	0	“ Maybe . I ’ll text you . ”
85698	85710	85711	85711	she	1343	“ I wish you would have told me about that night , ”
85718	85728	85714	85714	her	1343	“ I feel awful you went through that alone . ”
85729	85734	85683	85683	I	0	“ It ’s okay . ”
85735	85743	85714	85714	her	1343	“ Are you going to tell Dad ? ”
85744	85747	85748	85748	I	0	“ No . ”
85756	85790	85748	85748	I	0	“ Dad does not need to hear it at this point . He was hard enough on himself , and I do n’t want him feeling guilty about this . He ’s happy . ”
85791	85801	85802	85802	She	1343	“ He is happy . Thank goodness for Frannie . ”
85807	85833	85802	85802	She	1343	“ It ’s funny to me — Frannie was younger than we are now when she married Dad . Did n’t she seem so old ? ”
85839	85856	85802	85802	She	1343	“ Yes . I ’d never seen two old people act so stupid . Especially Dad . ”
85857	85874	85875	85875	I	0	“ Think they would have gotten together if we had n’t told him what was what ? ”
85878	85900	85901	85901	She	1343	“ Probably . It would have taken longer , since Dad was so stubborn , but they were obviously in love . ”
85906	85916	85901	85901	She	1343	“ So you ’re saying love finds a way ? ”
85917	85924	85925	85925	I	0	“ It ’s different for us . ”
85928	85936	85925	85925	I	0	“ We ’re not Dad and Frannie . ”
85937	85943	85901	85901	She	1343	“ What ’s so different ? ”
85944	85949	85950	85950	I	0	“ We ’re just — ”
85966	85974	85959	85959	Hutton	151	“ We were born under different stars . ”
86014	86026	86003	86003	Gianni	152	“ Oh , hey . Someone ’s waiting to see you . ”
86027	86032	86003	86003	Gianni	152	“ What ? Where ? ”
86033	86056	86057	86057	I	0	“ I think she ’s in the tasting room now , but she walked right into the kitchen a little bit ago . ”
86062	86066	86057	86057	I	0	“ Tall blonde ? ”
86067	86080	86081	86081	He	152	“ Yeah . I told her she could n’t wait back here . ”
86084	86091	86081	86081	He	152	“ Sent her Ellie ’s way . ”
86092	86103	86104	86104	I	0	“ Sorry about that . I ’ll deal with her . ”
86109	86117	86104	86104	I	0	“ Should only take a few minutes . ”
86118	86122	86125	86125	I	0	“ Go ahead . ”
86187	86190	86191	86191	I	0	“ Hey , ”
86199	86206	86191	86191	I	0	“ You ’re looking for me ? ”
86219	86224	86207	86207	She	92	“ There you are . ”
86231	86236	86225	86225	I	0	“ Here I am . ”
86242	86258	86237	86237	She	92	“ Did you get your bangs cut again ? You really should fire that stylist . ”
86259	86274	86284	86284	her	92	“ What do you want , Mimi ? I have to get to work . ”
86275	86279	86284	86284	her	92	“ You know , ”
86287	86306	86280	86280	she	92	“ I was wondering why you ’d still work as a cook since getting engaged to a billionaire . ”
86307	86313	86314	86314	I	0	“ I like my job , ”
86321	86359	86318	86318	She	92	“ That ’s good , because now that I know the whole thing was a scam and you ’re not really engaged to a billionaire at all , you ’ll probably be working it for a while . ”
86362	86369	86374	86374	she	238	“ So how ’s it going ? ”
86384	86409	86374	86374	she	238	“ I have n’t even seen you since you got back from New York . You ignore me now that you have a fiancée . ”
86410	86413	86414	86414	I	0	“ Sorry . ”
86432	86445	86414	86414	I	0	“ Looks like you guys had fun . I saw some pictures . ”
86454	86475	86446	86446	I	0	“ We had fun . Despite the people who felt it necessary to intrude on our privacy and take photos . ”
86476	86484	86485	86485	She	238	“ The ones I saw were good . ”
86495	86515	86485	86485	She	238	“ I mean , you knew people were going to be interested . The love lives of celebrities sell . ”
86516	86543	86544	86544	Allie	71	“ But it ’s fucking annoying . I do n’t want to be a celebrity . And Felicity did n’t ask for that kind of attention . ”
86547	86565	86566	86566	She	238	“ No , but it sort of comes with the territory . She knows who you are . ”
86585	86593	86578	86578	I	0	“ Quite a ring you gave her . ”
86594	86597	86569	86569	She	238	“ Yeah . ”
86598	86608	86578	86578	I	0	“ Have you guys settled on a date yet ? ”
86609	86612	86613	86613	She	238	“ No . ”
86633	86638	86623	86623	she	238	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
86639	86642	86643	86643	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
86651	86657	86643	86643	I	0	“ Is it the hearing ? ”
86658	86666	86623	86623	she	238	“ That ’s a lot of it . ”
86667	86676	86677	86677	I	0	“ So what ’s the rest of it ? ”
86702	86713	86686	86687	The kids	289	“ You know I ’ll get it out of you . ”
86714	86724	86623	86623	she	238	“ Maybe I ’m dreading that stupid engagement party . ”
86725	86737	86623	86623	she	238	“ Hutton ! You ’re not supposed to know about that . ”
86738	86742	86686	86687	The kids	289	“ Too late . ”
86743	86748	86623	86623	she	238	“ Who told you ? ”
86749	86782	86783	86783	Allie	71	“ Felicity . She heard it from her sister that works at Abelard , because unlike my family , her family knows how much I hate parties and gave us a warning . ”
86807	86851	86803	86803	she	71	“ It was not my idea , okay ? But Mom consulted some crazy celestial calendar that said to throw a party on that date . When she found out it was available , she took it as a sign from the stars . ”
86852	86858	86945	86945	Her	71	“ Of course she did . ”
86859	86868	86869	86869	I	0	“ Is that really what ’s bothering you ? ”
86887	86904	86869	86869	I	0	“ There ’s just a constant loop of negative shit running through my brain , okay ? ”
86905	86920	86945	86945	Her	71	“ They ’re just thoughts . You do n’t have to give them power . ”
86921	86938	86945	86945	Her	71	“ Do n’t go therapist on me . I do n’t fucking need it right now . ”
86939	86944	86945	86945	Her	71	“ Okay , okay . ”
86953	86960	86949	86949	she	71	“ I just want to help . ”
86966	86972	86961	86961	I	0	“ You ca n’t help . ”
86973	87029	86945	86945	Her	71	“ All right . Then I ’ll just say I ’m really proud of you for having the guts to finally admit your feelings for Felicity and asking her to marry you . I know how hard that must have been . And I think you made the perfect choice . She ’s really amazing . ”
87036	87044	87045	87045	Allie	71	“ She ’s so good for you , ”
87049	87087	87045	87045	Allie	71	“ She ’s always understood you so well . You really need someone who ’s a safe place , someone to ground you . But also someone who can stand up to you when it ’s necessary . ”
87088	87092	87093	87093	I	0	“ I know , ”
87115	87179	87180	87180	I	0	“ I ’m just so glad you got out of your head and told her how you feel before it was too late . I mean , it took you long enough — but also , it came out of nowhere . One minute you wo n’t even go to a reunion , and the next — poof , you ’re getting married . ”
87185	87188	87183	87183	her	1359	“ Allie . ”
87189	87192	87183	87183	her	1359	“ Yes ? ”
87198	87202	87183	87183	her	1359	“ You know . ”
87203	87207	87208	87208	She	1359	“ Know what ? ”
87214	87261	87208	87208	She	1359	“ That your sudden engagement is totally ridiculous ? That it was a ploy to get Mom off your back ? That you two are actually in love but somehow feel more comfortable faking it ? Which thing that I know should we talk about first ? ”
87262	87272	87183	87183	her	1359	“ Fuck . Why did n’t you say something ? ”
87273	87332	87333	87333	She	1359	“ What good would that have done ? You two clearly had your reasons , you ’re consenting adults , and people work out their shit in different ways . I just figured this was your way of finally crossing the line without fear . If you could call it all for show , it was less pressure . ”
87336	87354	87355	87355	I	0	“ Plus , it was a riot to watch you two react that morning at your house . ”
87358	87379	87355	87355	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you knew . You made us take all those pictures ! You made us kiss . ”
87380	87384	87385	87385	She	1359	“ I know . ”
87388	87398	87385	87385	She	1359	“ So did you guys plant the story yourselves ? ”
87399	87403	87355	87355	I	0	“ Not exactly . ”
87453	87467	87468	87468	she	1359	“ To get Mom off your back ? Was I right about that ? ”
87484	87491	87468	87468	she	1359	“ Yes . Also . . . ”
87500	87520	87521	87521	I	0	“ Also , you wanted to be with her . And this handed you the opportunity without the vulnerability . ”
87524	87544	87521	87521	I	0	“ You do n’t have to make me sound like an asshole . We both agreed to the plan . ”
87545	87556	87557	87557	She	1359	“ I ’m not here to judge you , Hutton . ”
87561	87574	87557	87557	She	1359	“ But I have a feeling something went wrong with your plan . ”
87575	87583	87584	87584	I	0	“ Nothing was wrong with the plan , ”
87587	87610	87611	87611	She	1359	“ The plan was perfect . What went wrong was that I tried to make it better , and she got mad . ”
87619	87623	87611	87611	She	1359	“ Go on . ”
87624	87658	87557	87557	She	1359	“ We were going to get through the party , then break it off and tell everyone we ’d decided we were better off as friends when I went back to San Francisco . ”
87659	87675	87676	87676	I	0	“ But then you realized you ’re in love with her and that plan sucks ? ”
87686	87704	87676	87676	I	0	“ Look , it does n’t really matter how I feel . We ca n’t stay together . ”
87705	87709	87557	87557	She	1359	“ Why not ? ”
87710	87731	87732	87732	She	1359	“ We just ca n’t , okay ? I ’m going back to San Francisco and her life is here . ”
87737	87744	87732	87732	She	1359	“ So it ’s the distance ? ”
87745	87748	87749	87749	I	0	“ Yes , ”
87752	87766	87749	87749	I	0	“ But you ’re a billionaire . Ca n’t you work from anywhere ? ”
87780	87797	87732	87732	She	1359	“ No , I ca n’t . I have to live where my company is based . ”
87798	87804	87732	87732	She	1359	“ Felicity wo n’t move ? ”
87805	87812	87813	87813	I	0	“ I did n’t ask her . ”
87819	87823	87813	87813	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
87824	87874	87732	87732	She	1359	“ Because her family is here , and her business is here , and she wo n’t want to upend her life that way for me . Why should she ? My relationships always end badly , and so do hers . We wanted something different . Something safer . ”
87875	87881	87882	87882	she	71	“ Interesting choice of words , ”
87885	87920	87882	87882	she	71	“ So you thought you were protecting yourself by giving the relationship a deadline ? That way neither of you would have to do the hurting or get hurt ? You could stay friends ? ”
87921	87924	87732	87732	She	1359	“ Exactly ! ”
87935	87938	87925	87925	I	0	“ Foolproof . ”
87939	87955	87882	87882	she	71	“ So how did you attempt to improve upon this totally safe and foolproof plan ? ”
87956	87972	87973	87973	I	0	“ We have to be out of the house we ’re in by August fifteenth , ”
87976	88010	87973	87973	I	0	“ But I suggested that I could rent or buy another place and she could live there when I go back to San Francisco . I was trying to do her a favor . ”
88017	88026	87973	87973	I	0	“ By suggesting she become a kept woman ? ”
88027	88040	88011	88011	My	0	“ It would n’t be like that . I care about her . ”
88041	88055	88011	88011	My	0	“ But that ’s not what you said to her , is it ? ”
88056	88062	88063	88063	I	0	“ She knows I care , ”
88066	88075	88063	88063	I	0	“ She does n’t know you love her . ”
88081	88089	88076	88076	I	0	“ I ca n’t tell her that . ”
88090	88095	88011	88011	My	0	“ Because . . . ”
88096	88108	88109	88109	I	0	“ Because then I ’m just like her mother , okay ? ”
88112	88132	88109	88109	I	0	“ I ’d have to say it and walk away , and I ca n’t do that to her . ”
88140	88173	88174	88174	She	238	“ You ’re missing the point — I’m suggesting that maybe you do n’t walk away , Hutton . You tell her you love her and you find a way to stay . ”
88185	88234	88174	88174	She	238	“ You accept that you ’re not perfect , you accept that you ’ll probably always have that shitty voice in your head , but you accept that you ’re still deserving and fucking capable of love . Or you let her go . That ’s your choice . ”
88261	88268	88242	88242	her	238	“ I said no therapist shit . ”
88269	88282	88283	88283	She	238	“ That was n’t therapy shit . That was big sister shit . ”
88289	88302	88283	88283	She	238	“ Now you go out there and think about what you did . ”
88383	88393	88395	88395	Zosia	108	“ Why are you in such a bad mood ? ”
88411	88416	88417	88417	I	0	“ I ’m not . ”
88434	88447	88417	88417	I	0	“ Yes , you are . You ’ve been grumpy all day . ”
88448	88462	88471	88471	she	238	“ I just bought you an ice cream cone , did n’t I ? ”
88463	88466	88467	88467	she	238	“ Yes , ”
88478	88483	88471	88471	she	238	“ Want a lick ? ”
88484	88489	88417	88417	I	0	“ No , thanks . ”
88490	88502	88506	88506	she	238	“ When you get married , will Felicity be my aunt ? ”
88514	88519	88506	88506	she	238	“ I guess so . ”
88520	88533	88534	88534	I	0	“ And when you have kids , will they be my cousins ? ”
88538	88542	88534	88534	I	0	“ They would . ”
88543	88551	88506	88506	she	238	“ Cool . I want some cousins . ”
88560	88568	88557	88557	she	238	“ You ’ll be a good dad . ”
88575	88582	88557	88557	she	238	“ What makes you say that ? ”
88583	88607	88506	88506	she	238	“ You like the park , you never care about getting sandy or messy or wet , and you buy us ice cream . ”
88608	88620	88621	88621	She	238	“ That ’s all it takes to be a good dad ? ”
88624	88630	88621	88621	She	238	“ Pretty much , yeah . ”
88648	88664	88639	88639	she	238	“ Good luck in D.C. Call me if you need a pep talk , okay ? ”
88665	88668	88639	88639	she	238	“ Okay . ”
88669	88676	88639	88639	she	238	“ What time is your flight ? ”
88677	88682	88683	88683	She	238	“ Early . Six . ”
88695	88703	88683	88683	She	238	“ What will you do about Felicity ? ”
88704	88710	88711	88711	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
88714	88742	88743	88743	She	238	“ First I have to get through that fucking hearing . And maybe after a few days apart , I ’ll be able to think more clearly . ”
88746	88753	88743	88743	She	238	“ Sometimes distance does add perspective . ”
88754	88763	88764	88764	I	0	“ I wish I could see the future , ”
88767	88776	88764	88764	I	0	“ To know how it would play out . ”
88777	88781	88782	88782	Allie	71	“ Me too . ”
88786	88832	88782	88782	Allie	71	“ But unfortunately , no matter what Mom thinks , there ’s no way to know what the future holds . No dream , no crystal ball , no palm reading , or tea leaves or tarot card is going to give you the answer . ”
88833	88836	88837	88837	She	238	“ Yeah . ”
88849	88885	88837	88837	She	238	“ Even though we want the path to be clear and easy , the truth is , sometimes there ’s a lot of shit in the way . And the only way out is through . ”
88900	88904	88837	88837	She	238	“ Excuse me ? ”
88905	88915	88916	88916	She	238	“ Your engagement . It ’s all a lie . ”
88922	88926	88918	88918	her	238	“ Keep up . ”
88933	88940	88918	88918	her	238	“ What are you talking about ? ”
88941	88990	89011	89011	she	238	“ I will admit you two put on a pretty good show at the reunion , but it never sat right with me — maybe you ’d have made a cute couple back in high school , but a guy like Hutton is out of your league now . ”
88991	89003	89004	89004	I	0	“ Well , I ’m wearing a ring that says otherwise . ”
89020	89037	89038	89038	She	238	“ Yes , I know all about the ring and the dress and the . . . ”
89060	89063	89040	89040	her	238	“ Kink . ”
89070	89073	89040	89040	her	238	“ What ? ”
89074	89139	89040	89040	her	238	“ I was there , at the coffee shop last Saturday morning . I came in after you were already there and sat in the booth right behind you , but you were so preoccupied with your story that you did n’t even notice me . I do find it odd that you ’d have sex with someone you ’re not even really dating . ”
89140	89152	89153	89153	She	1373	“ You were at Plum & Honey ? Sitting behind me ? ”
89160	89171	89153	89153	She	1373	“ I heard you say all kinds of interesting things . ”
89199	89204	89193	89193	she	1373	“ You ’re crazy . ”
89205	89236	89237	89237	She	1373	“ I have notes , in case your memory is faulty . I did n’t want to forget a single word , so I wrote down what I was hearing . ”
89248	89279	89237	89237	She	1373	“ ‘ Things are n’t like that with us . This is n’t a real relationship or a real engagement . It ’s something I made up , remember ? ’ ”
89286	89293	89280	89280	She	1373	“ Does that ring a bell ? ”
89302	89346	89347	89347	She	1373	“ Oh , there ’s also this . ‘ I know it might look real on the outside , but that ’s just because we ’re having a good time . It ’s one hundred percent fake . We are not together . ’ ”
89359	89395	89396	89396	She	1373	“ I also heard the part about the safe word and the bloody nose — so good ! I mean , really , this story has everything , humor , sex , deception . . . ”
89401	89407	89396	89396	She	1373	“ I was thoroughly entertained . ”
89413	89434	89435	89435	She	1373	“ Mimi , I have to go to work . I do n’t know what your problem is , but — ”
89438	89451	89435	89435	She	1373	“ I do n’t have a problem , Felicity . You do . ”
89452	89458	89396	89396	She	1373	“ And what ’s that ? ”
89459	89494	89435	89435	She	1373	“ I ’m going to make sure this story gets out , and then what will your perfect family think ? It ’s obvious to me only one sister knows you ’re scamming everyone . ”
89495	89502	89503	89503	I	0	“ We ’re not scamming anyone , ”
89506	89514	89503	89503	I	0	“ This is none of your business . ”
89515	89555	89435	89435	She	1373	“ Oh really ? Because I was chatting with your mom at her coffee shop before I left on Saturday , and it was obvious she does n’t know you ’re a liar . She was just so happy . ”
89556	89564	89565	89565	I	0	“ Leave my family out of this , ”
89571	89612	89565	89565	I	0	“ And Hutton ’s family too . I happened to run into his mother at her shop last week , and she was simply beside herself about your upcoming nuptials . She could n’t say enough sweet things about you . ”
89639	89645	89646	89646	she	1374	“ I was also thinking , ”
89657	89698	89646	89646	she	1374	“ how terrible it would be for Hutton if this got out . I know he ’s testifying this week down in D.C. The last thing he ’d want people saying about him is that he ’s crooked and shady . ”
89808	89817	89818	89818	I	0	“ Why are you doing this , Mimi ? ”
89823	89830	89818	89818	I	0	“ I do n’t get it . ”
89843	89867	89839	89839	her	1381	“ I ’m doing this because I do n’t think it ’s right that people can just lie and get away with it . ”
89868	89880	89839	89839	her	1381	“ So you ’re doing this in the name of truth ? ”
89881	89884	89839	89839	her	1381	“ Exactly . ”
89885	89888	89889	89889	I	0	“ Bullshit ! ”
89911	89921	89904	89904	I	0	“ You ’re doing this because you ’re jealous . ”
89935	89940	89930	89930	She	92	“ Jealous ? Moi ? ”
89941	89944	89948	89948	I	0	“ Yes . ”
89955	89962	89948	89948	I	0	“ You . Are . Jealous . ”
89974	89984	89963	89963	She	1381	“ What would I have to be jealous about ? ”
89985	90007	90008	90008	I	0	“ I do n’t know . My ring ? Hutton ’s money ? The attention we ’re getting ? Or maybe , ”
90027	90053	90015	90015	Thornton	119	“ maybe it ’s my relationship with Hutton . The way we look at each other . Respect each other . How close we are . ”
90054	90063	90064	90064	she	1381	“ That wo n’t last , you know , ”
90068	90128	90064	90064	she	1381	“ Thornton used to look at me that way , the way Hutton looks at you . It goes away . The business trips get longer . The rumors about other girls will start . His clothes will smell like cheap perfume . His lies will get more clumsy , until he wo n’t even bother to lie anymore . ”
90134	90139	90129	90129	I	0	“ We ’re different . ”
90140	90143	90144	90144	She	1381	“ Anyway . ”
90160	90196	90197	90197	She	1381	“ People deserve to know the truth . But I ’m not totally heartless . I ’m giving you a chance to offer your side of the story . Explain why you faked an engagement . ”
90202	90260	90197	90197	She	1381	“ Was it about money ? Was he paying you to make him seem more normal ? There are all those rumors about him being weird and anti - social . Then there are the things Zlatka said about him wanting to be cruel to her in the bedroom . Tie her up and boss her around . ”
90280	90286	90275	90275	I	0	“ I have no comment . ”
90287	90296	90199	90199	her	1381	“ You do n’t want to defend yourself ? ”
90297	90305	90275	90275	I	0	“ I have n’t done anything wrong . ”
90306	90312	90275	90275	I	0	“ You lied to me ! ”
90313	90318	90319	90319	I	0	“ Okay , fine ! ”
90325	90409	90319	90319	I	0	“ You want an explanation ? Here it is . I was sick and tired of you making me feel small . You did it all through high school and I vowed that I was not going to let you do it again . So when you stood there at the reunion cutting me down to size , instead of telling you to fuck off like I should have , I made up the lie about being engaged to Hutton to save face . ”
90410	90417	90275	90275	I	0	“ You did it for me ? ”
90423	90434	90435	90435	I	0	“ I did it to take you down a notch , ”
90438	90441	90435	90435	I	0	“ Oh . ”
90447	90469	90470	90470	I	0	“ I did it for girls like me who never had the guts to stand up for themselves in high school , ”
90474	90537	90470	90470	I	0	“ I did it because it ’s not okay to treat people like you ’re better than they are just because you have really great hair . And then I snuck off to a coat closet and called Hutton , begging him to come rescue me , even though he hated high school , hates parties , and dreads being in public . ”
90538	90544	90545	90545	She	1383	“ And he showed up ? ”
90549	90567	90545	90545	She	1383	“ Yes . He showed up . That ’s what friends like us do for each other . ”
90568	90617	90470	90470	I	0	“ God . Thornton would never have done that for me . I had to drag him to that reunion , and he complained the whole time , even though I ’d done so much work to put on a nice event . He does n’t appreciate me . ”
90621	90631	90618	90618	Mimi	92	“ It ’s almost not even worth the money . ”
90637	90643	90632	90632	I	0	“ So find someone else . ”
90644	90651	90652	90652	She	1383	“ Easy for you to say . ”
90655	90686	90652	90652	She	1383	“ Everyone likes you . Everyone thinks you ’re so clever and talented and sweet . Even in high school , no one ever said a bad word about you . ”
90687	90704	90705	90705	She	1383	“ Mimi , give me a break . You were the most popular girl in school . ”
90710	90726	90707	90707	her	1383	“ They were scared of me . It ’s not the same as being liked . ”
90727	90744	90652	90652	She	1383	“ They were scared because you were mean . Why do n’t you try being kind ? ”
90745	90753	90754	90754	She	1383	“ Then I would n’t be respected . ”
90757	90775	90754	90754	She	1383	“ But I ’ll give it some thought . I ’ve been working on self - love . ”
90782	90808	90776	90776	I	0	“ Look , I do n’t have time to argue about this . What can I do to persuade you not to leak this story ? ”
90809	90858	90754	90754	She	1383	“ Nothing . I promised Thornton ’s sister a big story . She runs dirty - little - scoop - dot - com and she hates me , so I need this to butter her up . She ’s always in Thornton ’s ear saying shit about me . ”
90859	90868	90776	90776	I	0	“ Ca n’t you give her another scoop ? ”
90869	90875	90876	90876	she	1384	“ Do you have one ? ”
90885	90888	90880	90880	I	0	“ No . ”
90889	90899	90900	90900	She	1384	“ Then I have to use you . Sorry . ”

90922	90936	90916	90916	my	0	“ Can you at least wait until after the weekend to tell her ? ”
90943	90954	90955	90955	I	0	“ I guess . What ’s in it for me ? ”
90961	90973	90955	90955	I	0	“ I ’ll give you my side . Complete insider scoop . ”
90980	90988	90976	90976	her	1384	“ Including the part about the kink ? ”
90989	90999	90976	90976	her	1384	“ No . But I ’ll spill everything else . ”
91044	91050	91028	91028	I	0	“ When can it run ? ”
91051	91054	91028	91028	I	0	“ Monday . ”
91125	91128	91130	91130	Mimi	92	“ Fine , ”
91132	91147	91130	91130	Mimi	92	“ But you have to give me your side of the story this week . ”
91148	91164	91165	91165	Mimi	92	“ You ’ll get it no sooner than Sunday . I do n’t trust you . ”
91169	91188	91165	91165	Mimi	92	“ I ’m not a monster , Felicity . I ’m just a woman looking out for herself . ”
91196	91218	91219	91219	I	0	“ You know , Mimi , there ’s something other than self - love I think you need to work on , ”
91223	91229	91219	91219	I	0	“ It ’s called empathy . ”
91872	91881	91882	91882	I	0	“ I ’m going back to the hotel , ”

92573	92589	92521	92521	her	1418	“ I did n’t think you ’d answer . I thought you were at work . ”
92590	92604	92558	92558	She	1418	“ I was n’t feeling well tonight . I took the night off . ”
92605	92610	92611	92611	I	0	“ Are you okay ? ”
92617	92631	92611	92611	I	0	“ I ’m fine . Just . . . needed a night off . ”

93038	93087	93088	93088	I	0	“ It ’s the right way . The only way . We ’ll get through the party , and then figure things out . But it ’s nothing you need to worry about now . Focus on the hearing , and we ’ll talk when you get back . ”
93096	93103	93088	93088	I	0	“ Is that what you want ? ”

93313	93333	93284	93284	She	83	“ He wo n’t . I probably bought it anyway . But what I really need is a tissue . ”
93334	93339	93340	93340	She	83	“ Be right back . ”
93363	93368	93340	93340	She	83	“ Here you go . ”

93438	93451	93433	93433	She	83	“ I know . I loaded the last bag in the car . ”
93452	93487	93400	93400	Millie	83	“ Thanks . I promise I wo n’t stay with you too long — just until after the party , when it will make more sense that I had to move out of here . ”

93507	93514	93502	93502	She	83	“ So what did he say ? ”
93515	93532	93400	93400	Millie	83	“ He said he was sorry for offering me a place to live when he leaves . ”
93533	93538	93400	93400	Millie	83	“ That ’s it ? ”
93539	93554	93555	93555	Millie	83	“ He also said he would do anything for me , if I asked . ”
93558	93569	93555	93555	Millie	83	“ But you ca n’t ask him to love you . ”
93570	93573	93574	93574	I	0	“ Nope , ”
93582	93587	93574	93574	I	0	“ I ca n’t . ”
93722	93753	93754	93754	I	0	“ Hutton French was the most articulate , and gave measured , thoughtful answers to all questions , admitting when something was uncertain and offering solutions that addressed major concerns . ”
93787	93792	93793	93793	she	89	“ Oh , hey , ”
93802	93831	93793	93793	she	89	“ I need to borrow Millie ’s hand mixer , and she said I should just come get it . Mine broke . What are you doing here ? ”

93934	93943	93930	93930	Her	89	“ Is that why you cut those bangs ? ”
93953	93956	93944	93944	I	0	“ Yeah . ”
93964	93969	93957	93957	Winnie	89	“ Need to talk ? ”
93970	93993	93994	93994	I	0	“ There ’s really not much to talk about . We ’re just — thinking things over . Taking a step back . ”
94005	94013	94014	94014	Winnie	89	“ We did move kind of fast . ”
94018	94077	94014	94014	Winnie	89	“ I guess , but . . . but you ’ve been so close for so many years ! You had these feelings buried deep inside you ! He was pining for you from afar , and you were locked in a tower of longing , knowing you were meant to be , and suddenly there he was ! ”
94083	94091	94092	94092	She	89	“ Wow . A tower of longing ? ”

94135	94150	94123	94123	I	0	“ Hutton and I both have some baggage that makes it difficult to trust . ”
94151	94215	94092	94092	She	89	“ Everyone has baggage ! Dex ’s baggage could sink a ship ! His parents ’ marriage was awful , his dad was absent and emotionally abusive , his divorce was difficult , he ’s a single dad . . . believe me , it was not easy to work through . But if you love each other , you do the work . ”
94216	94221	94222	94222	I	0	“ I get it . ”
94231	94240	94222	94222	I	0	“ And maybe we ’ll figure it out . ”

94289	94292	94222	94222	I	0	“ Nothing . ”
94300	94319	94293	94293	I	0	“ Just let it go on as planned . We do n’t want to cause anyone any stress . ”
94320	94335	94272	94272	She	89	“ But if you guys are n’t even together , what ’s the point ? ”
94336	94343	94344	94344	I	0	“ We ’re not not together , ”
94357	94366	94344	94344	I	0	“ So why are you living with Millie ? ”
94367	94384	94385	94385	I	0	“ For some space . But Winnie , you ca n’t tell anyone I ’m here . ”
94389	94429	94385	94385	I	0	“ I mean it — not Mom , not Dad , not Hutton ’s family , not anyone . I know it ’s hard for you to keep secrets , but I need you to keep this to yourself . ”
94430	94434	94435	94435	she	1429	“ I promise , ”
94439	94451	94452	94452	She	1429	“ I ’m locking my lips and throwing away the key . ”

94472	94481	94482	94482	Her	1429	“ But I ’m really sad about this . ”
94486	94503	94482	94482	Her	1429	“ I love you guys together . I want you to have a happily ever after . ”
94518	94542	94543	94543	She	1429	“ We ’ll always be friends , no matter what . That might be what our happily ever after looks like , okay ? ”
94550	94567	94545	94545	her	1429	“ No . That is not how a romance ends . I do n’t accept it . ”
94583	94590	94545	94545	her	1429	“ Try . I will too . ”
94896	94908	94909	94909	Wade	100	“ Dude , come on . Let ’s go get drunk . ”
94922	94951	94909	94909	Wade	100	“ This smokin ’ hot intern told me where she and her friends hang out after work . She said they ’ll be there by five - thirty . ”
94952	94958	94959	94959	Wade	100	“ I ’m not interested . ”
94962	94988	94959	94959	Wade	100	“ You ’re never interested . But you killed it in there , do n’t you want to celebrate ? One drink . Come on . ”
95001	95037	94995	94995	My	0	“ Fine , one drink . But I ’m not going to some bar crowded with interns . Let ’s just grab a drink somewhere close , then I ’ll go back to the hotel . ”

95059	95064	95051	95051	He	100	“ Let ’s go . ”
95068	95078	95079	95079	Wade	100	“ So what ’s the deal with this engagement ? ”
95088	95097	95079	95079	Wade	100	“ You really gon na marry this chick ? ”
95105	95114	95115	95115	He	100	“ I do n’t want to discuss it . ”
95118	95124	95115	95115	He	100	“ Trouble in paradise already ? ”
95133	95200	95201	95201	Wade	100	“ Listen , I get it . Women are a fucking pain in the ass . They ’re never satisfied . You give them one thing , and then they want more . They say they do n’t want you to change , but they do . They claim they ’re happy if you ’re happy , but that ’s the biggest fucking lie of all . ”
95215	95243	95201	95201	Wade	100	“ They do n’t want you to be happy . They want you to be miserable , and they go at it like it ’s their job . ”
95244	95251	95201	95201	Wade	100	“ Felicity is n’t like that . ”
95252	95277	95201	95201	Wade	100	“ Well , she ’s not like that now . But it changes once that ring is on your finger . Mark my words . ”
95278	95301	95302	95302	Wade	100	“ I ’ve known her for fifteen years . She ’d never want anyone to be miserable , least of all me . ”
95305	95350	95302	95302	Wade	100	“ If you say so . But think about it — marriage is fucking permanent . You ca n’t just get out of it . One woman until the end . One body . One piece of ass for the rest of your life . ”
95356	95362	95351	95351	I	0	“ You ’re a dick . ”
95372	95449	95363	95363	He	100	“ I ’m just trying to be a good friend , dude . Warn you about what ’s ahead — but if you like eating the same meal every night until the end of time , be my guest and get married . Because that ’s what it ’s like . Even if the steak is good , you get bored . And I ca n’t help it if I sometimes want to taste something else . ”
95450	95467	95468	95468	Wade	100	“ If you do n’t stop talking , I might actually punch you in the face . ”
95475	95481	95468	95468	Wade	100	“ What ’s your problem ? ”
95482	95567	95568	95568	Wade	100	“ My problem is that I love this woman you ’re talking about like she ’s a fucking piece of meat . And I ca n’t think of anything better than having her to myself for the rest of my life . The thought of being with someone else is absurd . The thought of her being with someone else makes me want to put my fist through the wall . The thought of losing her because I ’m a fucking idiot is unacceptable . ”
95571	95605	95568	95568	Wade	100	“ Okay . Then get married . But do n’t blame me when it all goes to hell and you wish you were banging hot interns instead of getting your ass chewed out . ”
95606	95612	95613	95613	I	0	“ I have to go . ”
95626	95635	95613	95613	I	0	“ When are you back in the office ? ”
95636	95642	95643	95643	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
95650	95654	95643	95643	I	0	“ Maybe never . ”
95655	95665	95613	95613	I	0	“ Huh ? What the fuck does that mean ? ”
95666	95732	95613	95613	I	0	“ It means I did what I came here to do , but it does n’t matter as much as I thought it would — or rather , the reason it matters has nothing to do with HFX , and everything to do with me realizing I might fail but taking the risk anyway , because not taking it would have been the greater failure . ”
95733	95740	95643	95643	I	0	“ Dude . You lost me . ”
95741	95745	95746	95746	I	0	“ Never mind . ”
95851	95854	95855	95855	I	0	“ Hey . ”
95870	95875	95855	95855	I	0	“ I ’m home . ”
95909	95912	95903	95903	I	0	“ Felicity ? ”
95966	95969	95970	95970	I	0	“ Fuck ! ”
96349	96355	96344	96344	she	1456	“ You ’re back already ? ”
96356	96364	96340	96340	She	1456	“ Yeah . Can I come in ? ”
96365	96369	96370	96370	She	1456	“ Of course ! ”
96377	96385	96370	96370	She	1456	“ Congratulations . You did so great ! ”
96386	96389	96340	96340	She	1456	“ Thanks . ”
96390	96404	96340	96340	She	1456	“ How ’d you get through it ? Was it my stellar advice ? ”
96405	96411	96412	96412	I	0	“ Your suggestions did help , ”
96415	96421	96412	96412	I	0	“ Thanks for the text . ”
96422	96427	96428	96428	She	1456	“ You ’re welcome . ”
96439	96476	96428	96428	She	1456	“ The things I said were based on the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy , by the way . I asked Natalia for a few ideas . She ’s still open to talking with you . ”
96477	96486	96487	96487	I	0	“ I might take her up on that . ”
96497	96506	96487	96487	I	0	“ But first , I need your advice . ”
96519	96526	96511	96511	She	1456	“ Did I hear that right ? ”
96527	96537	96538	96538	She	1456	“ Please do n’t joke . This is serious . ”
96543	96553	96538	96538	She	1456	“ Okay . Want something to eat ? Coffee ? ”
96554	96565	96538	96538	She	1456	“ Coffee sounds good . I did n’t sleep much . ”
96566	96581	96538	96538	She	1456	“ I can tell . You ’ve got some major circles under those eyes . ”
96588	96594	96538	96538	She	1456	“ Where are the kids ? ”
96595	96626	96627	96627	She	1456	“ They slept at Mom and Dad ’s . I have early appointments this morning , so I have to be at the office in about forty - five minutes . ”
96639	96642	96627	96627	She	1456	“ Speak . ”
96643	96659	96538	96538	She	1456	“ Felicity moved out while I was gone . She did it without telling me . ”
96663	96671	96660	96660	She	1456	“ How do you feel about that ? ”
96672	96700	96627	96627	She	1456	“ At first I was angry that she just up and left without saying anything — we’ve been friends a long time , and it felt shitty . ”
96701	96706	96627	96627	She	1456	“ That ’s understandable . ”
96707	96729	96660	96660	She	1456	“ But she left me this letter that explained why she moved out , and it fucking tore me apart inside . ”
96730	96736	96627	96627	She	1456	“ What did she say ? ”
96737	96762	96627	96627	She	1456	“ She said she did n’t want to tell me because she did n’t want me to have additional stress while I was in D.C. ”
96763	96770	96627	96627	She	1456	“ That was thoughtful of her . ”
96771	96810	96811	96811	Allie	71	“ She said she left because she needed to step back from the fantasy of being a couple and remember what was real . She said she got carried away and her feelings grew beyond make - believe . ”
96814	96823	96811	96811	Allie	71	“ She ’s scared . She ran away . ”
96824	96839	96627	96627	She	1456	“ She said it ’s not my fault and she does n’t blame me . ”
96840	96846	96627	96627	She	1456	“ Do you blame yourself ? ”
96847	96857	96858	96858	I	0	“ Yes . No . I do n’t know . ”
96872	96881	96858	96858	I	0	“ She ’s everything to me , Allie . ”
96882	96889	96627	96627	She	1456	“ She needs to hear that . ”
96890	96909	96627	96627	She	1456	“ She told me not to contact her . She asked me to respect her need for space . ”
96910	96916	96858	96858	I	0	“ What about the party ? ”
96917	96945	96946	96946	I	0	“ She said she ’ll call me tomorrow and we ’ll make a plan to attend it , and then afterward figure out how to end things . ”
96950	96972	96973	96973	Allie	71	“ But I ca n’t let that happen . I ca n’t go a day without trying to get her back . ”
96977	96980	96973	96973	Allie	71	“ Okay . ”
96981	96990	96991	96991	I	0	“ That ’s why I need your advice . ”
96996	97022	96991	96991	I	0	“ What can I say to convince her to give me another chance ? How can I prove to her that she can trust me ? ”
97023	97034	97035	97035	she	71	“ You could start with telling her how you feel , ”
97038	97050	97035	97035	she	71	“ If you love her , she needs to hear it . ”
97051	97064	96991	96991	I	0	“ I do love her . I do . But . . . ”
97071	97093	97065	97065	I	0	“ I ca n’t get over this fucking thing in my head telling me I ’m not good enough for her . ”
97098	97104	97094	97095	My sister	238	“ Maybe you ’re not . ”
97110	97113	97108	97108	her	71	“ Huh ? ”
97114	97156	97160	97160	her	71	“ I mean , maybe the thing in your head is right . Maybe you ’re not good enough for her . Maybe you ’re going to fuck it up . Maybe she ’ll decide you ’re not worth the trouble . ”
97162	97168	97157	97157	I	0	“ You ’re not helping . ”
97169	97173	97174	97174	she	71	“ But maybe , ”
97178	97228	97174	97174	she	71	“ maybe you risk it . Maybe you get to spend the rest of your life doing things to make every day better for her . You ’ve already got her heart , Hutton . So maybe you find ways — big and small — to deserve it forever . ”
97234	97246	97229	97229	She	71	“ Does n’t that sound like a nice way to live ? ”
97298	97301	97302	97302	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
97311	97316	97317	97317	she	71	“ You ’re welcome ! ”
97322	97331	97317	97317	she	71	“ I ’ll bill you for the session ! ”
97392	97430	97387	97387	I	0	“ Hey , it ’s me . I found your letter . I want to respect your need for space , but I also really want to talk to you . Can you call me back please ? ”
97643	97649	97650	97650	I	0	“ Can I help you ? ”
97679	97682	97674	97674	I	0	“ Hutton ? ”
97701	97708	97709	97709	she	89	“ What are you doing here ? ”
97712	97719	97709	97709	she	89	“ Can I talk to you ? ”
97725	97728	97720	97720	I	0	“ Please ? ”
97733	97745	97748	97748	her	89	“ Um , okay . Let ’s go to my office . ”
97756	97759	97760	97760	I	0	“ Thanks , ”
97770	97775	97760	97760	I	0	“ I appreciate this . ”
97776	97780	97781	97781	She	89	“ Of course . ”
97790	97796	97781	97781	She	89	“ Please have a seat . ”
97806	97812	97813	97813	I	0	“ I need your help , ”
97816	97819	97813	97813	I	0	“ Okay . ”
97832	97847	97829	97829	her	89	“ I ’m looking for Felicity . Do you know where she might be ? ”
97848	97857	97858	97858	she	89	“ Do I know where she might be ? ”
97861	97864	97858	97858	she	89	“ Yes . ”
97865	97868	97869	97869	She	89	“ Um . ”
97876	97882	97869	97869	She	89	“ I ca n’t say . ”
97883	97899	97906	97906	her	89	“ Winnie , please . I need to talk to her . It ’s important . ”
97917	97922	97909	97909	she	89	“ But I promised . ”
97923	97928	97929	97929	I	0	“ Okay . Okay . ”
97938	97959	97929	97929	I	0	“ I know she probably told you not to say anything to anyone . But did she specifically mention me ? ”
97960	97963	97964	97964	she	89	“ No , ”
97973	97990	97964	97964	she	89	“ But she said not to tell anyone . And I ca n’t let her down . ”
97991	97995	97996	97996	I	0	“ I understand . ”
98001	98010	98011	98011	She	89	“ But this is sort of an emergency . ”
98016	98021	98011	98011	She	89	“ Are you okay ? ”
98022	98046	98047	98047	Winnie	89	“ Yes and no . I will be if I can talk to Felicity . There ’s something I have to tell her . ”
98059	98072	98057	98057	herself	89	“ I can keep a secret . I can keep a secret . ”
98073	98082	98083	98083	I	0	“ I ’ll give you a billion dollars . ”
98114	98119	98109	98109	I	0	“ Is that necessary ? ”
98134	98137	98120	98120	She	89	“ Okay . ”
98144	98166	98138	98138	I	0	“ I get it . You do n’t want to betray her , and I appreciate that . But . . . ”
98174	98192	98167	98167	I	0	“ I ’ve never been in love before , and I ’m not handling it very well . ”
98211	98278	98205	98205	Her	89	“ I do n’t know what I ’m doing . I ’m scared every word out of my mouth will be wrong . I ’m scared she wo n’t believe me when I tell her how much she means to me . I ’m scared that I blew my chance to be with the only girl who has ever made me feel like I ’m okay . ”
98294	98315	98288	98288	she	89	“ You did n’t . You can win her back . But maybe it should be something more than words . ”
98316	98323	98324	98324	I	0	“ Like what ? Tell me , ”
98327	98335	98336	98336	She	89	“ I ’ll do whatever it takes . ”
98342	98358	98359	98359	Winnie	89	“ You know , Felicity has always been a little different from Millie and me , ”
98362	98426	98359	98359	Winnie	89	“ Smarter and quieter and not into the same kinds of things we were . She was never overly obsessed with clothes or makeup or boys . When we played Cinderella as kids , I was the princess , Millie was the fairy godmother or the evil stepmother , depending on her mood , and you know what Felicity always wanted to be ? ”
98427	98430	98288	98288	she	89	“ What ? ”
98431	98436	98359	98359	Winnie	89	“ Merlin the wizard . ”
98445	98511	98439	98439	me	0	“ We ’d be like , ‘ There ’s no wizard in this story ! Ca n’t you be the prince ? ’ And she ’d be all , ‘ No ! The prince sucks ! What does he do to deserve her , ask her to dance ? Kiss her ? He never knows a thing about her , not even her name ! ’ ”
98512	98521	98522	98522	I	0	“ I mean , she ’s not wrong , ”
98525	98554	98522	98522	I	0	“ So she put Merlin the wizard into Cinderella . And somehow , in the end , it was always Merlin ’s magic that really saved the day . ”
98558	98588	98589	98589	She	89	“ I guess what I ’m trying to say is , Felicity does n’t need a prince . She does n’t need to be rescued . But . . . ”
98592	98603	98589	98589	She	89	“ Every girl wants to feel like a princess sometimes . ”
98604	98608	98609	98609	I	0	“ I understand . ”
98612	98619	98609	98609	I	0	“ No , I do n’t . ”
98624	98639	98620	98620	Winnie	89	“ You know her , Hutton . I think you can figure this out . ”
98645	98654	98655	98655	Winnie	89	“ Can you get a message to her ? ”
98658	98674	98675	98675	She	89	“ Do you have a piece of paper I could use ? And a pen ? ”
98734	98741	98742	98742	She	89	“ You ’re a good sister . ”
98745	98756	98742	98742	She	89	“ Thank you . My family is everything to me . ”
98845	98858	98859	98859	he	152	“ She ’s been in here a couple times looking for you , ”
98862	98875	98859	98859	he	152	“ She tried calling and texting but said you did n’t respond . ”
98876	98903	98904	98904	I	0	“ Yeah , I ’m taking a break from my social media , and it seemed easier to just take a break from my phone altogether , ”
98907	98916	98904	98904	I	0	“ I ’ll go see what she wants . ”
98938	98941	98942	98942	I	0	“ Hey , ”
98945	98952	98942	98942	I	0	“ You were looking for me ? ”
98953	98960	98961	98961	She	89	“ Yes . Hutton was here . ”
98964	98984	98961	98961	She	89	“ But I kept the secret . I had to tape my mouth shut , but I kept it . ”
98985	98988	98989	98989	My	0	“ Today ? ”
98993	98999	98989	98989	My	0	“ He was here today ? ”
99000	99007	98961	98961	She	89	“ Yes . Earlier this afternoon . ”
99008	99014	99015	99015	My	0	“ What did he want ? ”
99022	99036	99037	99037	she	89	“ To know where to find you . I did n’t tell him , ”
99041	99050	99051	99051	She	89	“ But I promised to give you this . ”
99096	99101	99102	99102	Winnie	89	“ What is it ? ”
99105	99112	99102	99102	Winnie	89	“ Some kind of secret language ? ”
99113	99116	99117	99117	I	0	“ Yes . ”
99120	99144	99117	99117	I	0	“ It says ‘ I love you . ’ It ’s written in the code we promised each other we ’d always honor . ”
99145	99168	99102	99102	Winnie	89	“ Aww , that ’s so cute . He looked really miserable — he does love you , Lissy . So much . ”
99169	99174	99102	99102	Winnie	89	“ You think so ? ”
99175	99223	99117	99117	I	0	“ Of course I do ! He told me he ’s never been in love before , and he does n’t know what he ’s doing , and he ’s scared he blew his only chance to be with the one person who means everything to him . ”
99229	99235	99117	99117	I	0	“ He said all that ? ”
99244	99290	99291	99291	She	1489	“ Yes ! And I ’m sure I was not supposed to tell you any of it , but in my defense , I did make it obvious I ’m terrible at keeping secrets . He also offered me a billion dollars for your whereabouts . ”
99296	99309	99310	99310	I	0	“ I want you to know I did n’t take the money . ”
99313	99317	99310	99310	I	0	“ Thank you . ”
99326	99361	99318	99318	She	1489	“ You ’re welcome . I think maybe you should hear him out , Felicity . Guys are n’t perfect , you know ? Sometimes they need a second chance to get something right . ”
99381	99384	99377	99377	I	0	“ Hello ? ”
99391	99403	99377	99377	I	0	“ That ’s new . I was expecting your usual greeting . ”
99404	99414	99379	99379	him	1490	“ I ’m working on some things about myself . ”
99415	99420	99421	99421	I	0	“ Good for you . ”
99424	99435	99421	99421	I	0	“ I got the bat signal . Are you okay ? ”
99436	99457	99379	99379	him	1490	“ No . There ’s something I have to tell you , or it ’s going to eat me alive . ”

100089	100128	100082	100082	He	151	“ I do n’t know what would have happened if I ’d had the nerve to kiss you that night . But I do know that I have always regretted not taking that chance when I had it . ”
100129	100137	100138	100138	I	0	“ Is this a do - over ? ”
100156	100164	100165	100165	He	151	“ It ’s a do - better . ”

100194	100197	100189	100189	I	0	“ Good . ”

100323	100367	100205	100205	he	151	“ Hold on . I want to hear every single word you want to say , but I ’m afraid if I do n’t get everything out all at once , I ’ll lose my nerve . Or I ’ll forget something important . ”
100368	100371	100372	100372	I	0	“ Okay , ”
100378	100481	100372	100372	I	0	“ That day my family showed up at my house and I asked you to keep pretending we were engaged , it was n’t only because I wanted my mother off my back . It was because I wanted the chance to be with you without the risk of losing you . I did n’t trust myself not to screw things up . I did n’t believe that someone like me could hold onto someone like you . I was convinced that if you got close enough , you ’d see all my flaws and idiosyncrasies and know you could do better . ”
100482	100489	100490	100490	I	0	“ All I want is you , ”
100493	100518	100490	100490	I	0	“ But I understand your fear . I was scared too . I thought I could ration my feelings the way I usually did . ”
100519	100523	100524	100524	I	0	“ Like truffles ? ”
100527	100549	100524	100524	I	0	“ Like truffles . But it did n’t work . Every day we were together I just fell deeper and deeper . ”
100550	100555	100556	100556	he	1510	“ I did too , ”
100559	100572	100556	100556	he	1510	“ I was a wreck when we got home from New York . ”
100573	100589	100590	100590	I	0	“ Same ! Even in New York — that day I tried on the dress . ”

100612	100617	100556	100556	he	1510	“ You were right . ”
100618	100623	100624	100624	I	0	“ And the ring . ”
100638	100646	100624	100624	I	0	“ You gave me a real ring . ”
100647	100676	100556	100556	he	1510	“ I wanted to buy you all the real things , because my feelings were real . But it was easier to spend money than to admit them . ”
100677	100695	100556	100556	he	1510	“ Let ’s make a promise that we ’ll be honest with each other from now on . ”
100696	100699	100556	100556	he	1510	“ Deal . ”
100700	100713	100714	100714	He	1511	“ Is this where I can tell you I love you too ? ”
100717	100720	100714	100714	He	1511	“ Sure . ”
100721	100752	100753	100753	I	0	“ I love you too — everything about you . What you see as flaws and idiosyncrasies are what make you different and special . I ’m not perfect either , ”
100759	100790	100753	100753	I	0	“ I ’ll probably always cut my hair when I ’m stressed , never walk right in high heels , and continue to blurt random things when I ’m nervous . ”
100791	100805	100556	100556	he	1510	“ I might think you were the wrong girl if you did n’t . ”
100806	100841	100714	100714	He	1511	“ And I know that you might not always be in touch with your earthy bull feelings , but I promise to be patient and not snatch them back into my little crab shell . ”
100842	100845	100846	100846	He	1512	“ Good . ”
100853	100863	100846	100846	He	1512	“ Because there ’s only one crab for me . ”
100864	100875	100876	100876	He	1512	“ So what happened that made you realize all this ? ”
100879	100921	100922	100922	I	0	“ My sister . Turns out , she knew the engagement was bullshit , but she did n’t say anything , because she thought it was just how we were working up the nerve to admit how we felt for real . ”
100925	100930	100922	100922	I	0	“ Just like Millie ! ”
100931	100955	100958	100958	his	1512	“ She saw me wrestling with my feelings and pretty much told me I had to get over myself or let you go . ”
100961	100975	100958	100958	his	1512	“ Letting you go was not an option . So here we are . ”
100976	100981	100982	100982	I	0	“ Here we are . ”
100988	100996	100982	100982	I	0	“ How are we here , anyway ? ”
100997	101012	100958	100958	his	1512	“ Turns out , one of the Prancin ’ Grannies is the boss here . ”
101013	101016	100958	100958	his	1512	“ Gladys ? ”
101017	101020	101021	101021	He	1512	“ Gladys . ”
101024	101041	101042	101042	I	0	“ Also I made a very large donation to the Friends of the Public Library Foundation . ”

101058	101061	101062	101062	He	1512	“ Possibly . ”
101073	101089	101062	101062	He	1512	“ What are the chances I can get you to come home with me tonight ? ”
101090	101100	101101	101101	He	1512	“ Hmm . Are we talking theoretical probability here ? ”
101104	101109	101101	101101	He	1512	“ If you insist . ”
101110	101134	101062	101062	He	1512	“ Then I would say the desired outcome is highly likely . In fact , I would say it is a mathematical certainty . ”
101164	101169	101170	101170	I	0	“ Five more minutes , ”
101297	101302	101303	101303	he	151	“ So about tonight , ”
101316	101324	101303	101303	he	151	“ I have a surprise for you . ”
101325	101329	101330	101330	I	0	“ You do ? ”
101336	101350	101330	101330	I	0	“ Yes — that is , if I have permission to surprise you . ”
101351	101355	101356	101356	I	0	“ You do . ”
101359	101365	101356	101356	I	0	“ I like your surprises . ”
101366	101388	101330	101330	I	0	“ I just have one request . Can I pick you up for the party at your sister Millie ’s house ? ”
101389	101395	101330	101330	I	0	“ Sure . But why ? ”
101396	101408	101409	101409	He	1518	“ If I tell you , that will spoil the surprise . ”
101417	101425	101409	101409	He	1518	“ You just have to trust me . ”
101426	101430	101431	101431	I	0	“ I do . ”

101487	101516	101517	101517	My	0	“ I have n’t decided that yet . But I want to live here — with you . I ’ll start looking for a new place this week . ”

101760	101765	101766	101766	Luna	112	“ The sparkly ones ! ”
101789	101798	101766	101766	Luna	112	“ Those look the most like glass slippers . ”
101799	101816	101766	101766	Luna	112	“ Of course you ’d pick those . Is n’t there a princess who wore sneakers ? ”
101817	101828	101829	101829	Millie	83	“ No . What should we do with her hair ? ”
101833	101836	101831	101831	Winnie	89	“ Hmmm . ”
101852	101866	101867	101867	Millie	83	“ What about a high bun ? Sort of an Audrey Hepburn look ? ”
101870	101875	101867	101867	Millie	83	“ That could work . ”
101917	101920	101921	101921	I	0	“ Well ? ”

102054	102062	102063	102063	Hallie	112	“ Because Winnie ca n’t keep secrets , ”

102630	102671	102672	102672	He	151	“ I can not believe you did this . For someone who does n’t like to be the center of attention , this is insane . Are you really Hutton French , the friend I ’ve known for fifteen years ? ”
102675	102698	102672	102672	He	151	“ Yes and no . I ’m really Hutton French , but I do n’t want to be just your friend anymore . ”

102856	102883	102851	102851	I	0	“ So what now ? Should we just pretend like we ’ve decided to postpone the wedding ? We can always say that Millie could n’t — ”
102884	102887	102888	102888	He	151	“ Hey . ”
102894	102905	102888	102888	He	151	“ How about we just enjoy the ride for now ? ”

I may not have magic powers , but you understand me , you accept me , you make me happy . I know this is probably a shock to you , and if you do n’t want to say yes today , that ’s okay too , but you are the only one for me , today and always . ”
103391	103394	103395	103395	I	0	“ Yes , ”
103404	103414	103395	103395	I	0	“ Of course yes ! A thousand times yes ! ”
103458	103475	103476	103476	He	1551	“ You do have magic powers — you turned this thing into a real engagement party ! ”
103494	103500	103484	103484	I	0	“ I ’ll never tell . ”
103501	103511	103512	103512	Hutton	151	“ What do you say , ladies ? Alfred ? ”
103518	103526	103512	103512	Hutton	151	“ Would you like to join us ? ”
103527	103535	103537	103544	a granny with thick penciled - in eyebrows	1556	“ We thought you ’d never ask , ”
103551	103567	103546	103546	Hutton	151	“ Felicity , this is Jackie . Her grandson is flying the plane up there . ”
103568	103579	103580	103580	I	0	“ It ’s so nice to meet you , Jackie . ”
103587	103596	103580	103580	I	0	“ And thank you all for being here . ”
103597	103603	103604	103604	Jackie	160	“ You ’re very welcome . ”
103610	103615	103604	103604	Jackie	160	“ Lead the way . ”

103689	103695	103696	103696	he	151	“ Their repertoire is limited , ”
103700	103707	103696	103696	he	151	“ But it works for me . ”
103753	103756	103761	103761	she	136	“ Awww , ”
103765	103776	103761	103761	she	136	“ I ’m so happy , I could cry too ! ”
103820	103828	103829	103829	Luna	112	“ We passed you on the road ! ”
103833	103845	103829	103829	Luna	112	“ But we were n’t allowed to yell out the windows . ”
103846	103852	103854	103854	Hallie	112	“ Or honk the horn , ”
103856	103864	103865	103865	I	0	“ Thank you so much for coming , ”
103870	103879	103865	103865	I	0	“ I ’m so glad you ’re here . ”
103880	103886	103888	103888	Hallie	112	“ We love engagement parties , ”
103890	103904	103888	103888	Hallie	112	“ Last time we went to one was the day we met Winnie ! ”
103905	103928	103930	103930	Luna	112	“ We ’re hoping our dad will ask Winnie to marry him , but he says to stop bugging him about it , ”
103937	103947	103934	103934	her	112	“ We ’ll never stop bugging him about it . ”
103948	103951	103953	103953	Luna	112	“ Never , ”
103955	103966	103967	103967	Hallie	112	“ But there ’s one thing I do n’t understand , ”
103981	104002	103967	103967	Hallie	112	“ Why does that sign say ‘ Felicity , will you marry me ? ’ Were n’t you already engaged ? ”
104015	104020	104021	104021	I	0	“ Yes and no , ”
104028	104035	104021	104021	I	0	“ Both things can be true . ”
104104	104107	104108	104108	I	0	“ Hey , ”
104117	104127	104108	104108	I	0	“ How are you ? Sorry we got separated . ”
104128	104133	104134	104134	He	151	“ I ’m fine . ”
104139	104151	104134	104134	He	151	“ Just needed a minute or two to catch my breath . ”
104152	104164	104165	104165	I	0	“ You ’ve been amazing tonight . Thank you for this . ”
104173	104177	104165	104165	I	0	“ For everything . ”
104178	104183	104184	104184	I	0	“ You ’re welcome . ”
104205	104216	104184	104184	I	0	“ It ’s so beautiful here , is n’t it ? ”
104217	104225	104165	104165	I	0	“ Would you like to live here ? ”
104226	104230	104231	104231	I	0	“ At Abelard ? ”
104234	104239	104231	104231	I	0	“ Who would n’t ? ”
104240	104275	104165	104165	I	0	“ Maybe not this exact spot , but maybe we could find something nearby . Or something on the water . Or something with some acreage and you could have your own small farm . ”
104279	104297	104276	104276	He	151	“ I might like being a farmer . Seems like a job with a lot of solitude . ”
104302	104307	104276	104276	He	151	“ You ’re serious ? ”
104308	104311	104312	104312	He	151	“ Yes . ”
104315	104327	104312	104312	He	151	“ I told Wade I might not come back to HFX . ”
104332	104335	104312	104312	He	151	“ What ? ”
104336	104366	104276	104276	He	151	“ It will likely mean a significant drop in my tax bracket , but I was thinking of doing something else with my life — starting with marrying you . ”
104377	104406	104407	104407	He	151	“ I feel like someone is going to wake me up any minute . This is a dream . You ’d give up being a billionaire for me ? ”
104410	104436	104407	104407	He	151	“ I ’ll still be a billionaire . But on a smaller scale . Hopefully small enough that no one will care about me anymore . ”
104452	104466	104437	104437	I	0	“ I ’ll care . Not about your billions . Just about you . ”
104478	104487	104467	104467	He	151	“ Will you move back in with me ? ”
104488	104494	104467	104467	He	151	“ Of course I will . ”
104495	104504	104467	104467	He	151	“ And stay for seventy - two years ? ”
104512	104516	104505	104505	I	0	“ At least . ”
104517	104556	104467	104467	He	151	“ Speaking of home , how much longer do we have to stay at this party ? As much as I love you in that dress , I ’m going to love you out of it even more . ”
104557	104562	104563	104563	I	0	“ You know what ? ”
104587	104608	104609	104609	He	151	“ I think we ’ve given them enough of us tonight . Should we say our goodbyes and sneak out ? ”
104616	104627	104609	104609	He	151	“ You never have to ask me that question twice . ”
104727	104731	104722	104722	Hutton	151	“ Come here . ”
104911	104916	104917	104917	I	0	“ I want this , ”
104927	104932	104917	104917	I	0	“ I need it . ”
104933	104940	104941	104941	He	151	“ You ’ll have to wait . ”
104961	104966	104972	104972	he	151	“ I ’m hungry . ”
105201	105226	105227	105227	he	151	“ I ’d rip this dress to shreds just to get it off you , but not if you want to wear it again , ”
105237	105243	105227	105227	he	151	“ So tell me now . ”
105244	105248	105249	105249	I	0	“ No ripping ! ”
105253	105266	105267	105267	He	151	“ I want to get married in this dress . Side zipper . ”
105315	105319	105320	105320	I	0	“ But wait , ”
105329	105342	105320	105320	I	0	“ You ’ve seen the dress already . Is that bad luck ? ”
105343	105352	105353	105353	he	151	“ Nope . We make our own luck , ”
105369	105418	105353	105353	he	151	“ I mean , I could spend a couple minutes trying to convert our odds to implied probabilities , but I ’m afraid my cognitive abilities have been hijacked by my dick and I ’m likely to misjudge the variance of the payout . Now get over here . ”
105472	105480	105459	105459	I	0	“ You ’re such a math nerd . ”
105481	105487	105488	105488	he	151	“ Some things never change , ”
105587	105592	105593	105593	I	0	“ I love you , ”
105600	105606	105607	105607	he	151	“ I love you too , ”
105615	105634	105635	105635	He	151	“ And I do n’t care what the odds are . I ’d bet on us every time . ”
105732	105749	105750	105750	Hutton	151	“ If anyone comes to the door in the morning , we ’re not answering it , ”
105754	105761	105750	105750	Hutton	151	“ I ’m not sharing you . ”
105762	105765	105766	105766	I	0	“ Deal , ”
105769	105789	105766	105766	I	0	“ We can stay in bed all day , and then go get the rest of my — shoot ! ”
105790	105793	105750	105750	Hutton	151	“ What ? ”
105823	105840	105809	105809	I	0	“ I have to tell you something , and you ’re not going to like it . ”
105841	105844	105845	105845	He	151	“ Now ? ”
105848	105881	105845	105845	He	151	“ Because I ’m really fucking content , and if it ’s like a big brunch or something you want me to attend in the morning , I ’d rather not know . ”
105882	105895	105896	105896	I	0	“ It ’s not brunch . It ’s Mimi Pepper - Peabody . ”
105923	105933	105917	105917	himself	151	“ Wait . She ’s trying to blackmail you ? ”
105934	105954	105900	105900	her	92	“ Not exactly . I do n’t think she wants money or anything . She just wants a story . ”
105955	105967	105968	105968	He	151	“ Well , fuck her . She ca n’t have ours . ”
105973	105989	105990	105990	I	0	“ I ’ll fucking buy that stupid tabloid tomorrow and put it out of business . ”
105993	106021	105990	105990	I	0	“ I know you would , but you know what ? I ’d rather have the satisfaction of telling Mimi she has no power over me anymore . ”
106022	106046	105900	105900	her	92	“ Good . She ’s the one who ’s going to look like an asshole anyway , since we actually are getting married . ”
106047	106050	105900	105900	her	92	“ True . ”
106051	106062	105990	105990	I	0	“ When do you want to do that , anyway ? ”
106063	106067	106068	106068	I	0	“ Get married ? ”
106074	106100	106068	106068	I	0	“ You know , unless you want to wait , we could just keep the wedding date Millie set aside for us at Cloverleigh Farms . ”
106101	106115	106116	106116	I	0	“ I do n’t need to wait . I know what I want . ”
106125	106143	106116	106116	I	0	“ Then let ’s do it . We can let everyone know tomorrow to save the date . ”
106151	106177	106144	106144	I	0	“ Oh yeah . I forgot there would be other people involved . I do n’t suppose I can convince you to elope , huh ? ”
106178	106197	106116	106116	I	0	“ No , but I do n’t need a three - ring circus either . Just our families . ”
106198	106205	106206	106206	I	0	“ And the Prancin ’ Grannies . ”
106209	106216	106206	106206	I	0	“ And the Prancin ’ Grannies . ”
106294	106300	106290	106290	she	92	“ You ’re here together ? ”
106301	106307	106308	106308	I	0	“ Of course we are , ”
106311	106333	106308	106308	I	0	“ And we only have a few minutes because we ’re heading to Cloverleigh Farms to finalize plans for our ceremony . ”
106339	106351	106334	106334	Mimi	92	“ Ceremony ? As in , you ’re really getting married ? ”
106352	106364	106290	106290	she	92	“ We ’re really getting married . Last Sunday in August . ”
106365	106377	106290	106290	she	92	“ But you said it was fake ! I heard you ! ”
106378	106384	106385	106385	I	0	“ You must have misunderstood , ”
106399	106416	106396	106396	Mimi	92	“ I did not . You admitted it to me in the tasting room at Abelard . ”
106417	106447	106290	106290	she	92	“ I ’m sure I have no idea what you mean . You were drinking that day . Perhaps you ’re confused — wine can do that to you . ”
106448	106454	106455	106455	Mimi	92	“ I was n’t confused , ”
106458	106484	106455	106455	Mimi	92	“ You told me you ’d made the whole thing up to take me down a notch . Now you ’re saying it ’s real ? ”
106485	106488	106489	106489	I	0	“ Exactly . ”
106495	106499	106491	106491	my	0	“ Keep up . ”
106511	106519	106500	106500	She	92	“ I could still leak the story . ”
106520	106524	106525	106525	I	0	“ You could , ”
106528	106546	106547	106547	Mimi	92	“ but you ’re the one who will look like a fool when we tie the knot . ”
106550	106570	106547	106547	Mimi	92	“ This is n’t fair . I ’m not the one who lied , but I ’m being punished . ”
106571	106589	106590	106590	Hutton	151	“ You lied to Felicity at the reunion when you swore you would n’t reveal our engagement , ”
106594	106600	106590	106590	Hutton	151	“ Oh , come on . ”
106606	106640	106601	106601	Mimi	92	“ Felicity knew I was going to tell everyone — I’m the mean girl . I ’ve always been the mean girl . People are only friends with me because I intimidate them . ”
106641	106648	106649	106649	I	0	“ Tell you what , Mimi , ”
106652	106670	106649	106649	I	0	“ You stop trying to intimidate me , and I ’ll try being your friend for real . ”
106671	106674	106675	106675	She	92	“ Seriously ? ”
106681	106689	106675	106675	She	92	“ Can I come to your wedding ? ”
106690	106695	106649	106649	I	0	“ We ’ll see . ”
106696	106715	106716	106716	I	0	“ And will you cater my bridal shower ? I ca n’t stop thinking about those watermelon crostinis . ”
106719	106722	106716	106716	I	0	“ Sure . ”
106723	106729	106730	106730	She	92	“ And maybe . . . ”
106739	106763	106730	106730	She	92	“ Maybe you could give me the name of your stylist ? I ’ve been thinking about trying some little bangs like yours . ”
106769	106775	106776	106776	Mimi	92	“ What ’s so funny ? ”
106779	106789	106776	106776	Mimi	92	“ Actually , Mimi , I cut them myself . ”
106790	106797	106798	106798	She	92	“ You cut your own hair ? ”
106803	106827	106828	106828	I	0	“ Sometimes . It ’s a nervous habit , something I do when I feel like my life is out of my control . ”
106831	106843	106828	106828	I	0	“ I should n’t do it , but you know what ? ”
106844	106847	106776	106776	Mimi	92	“ What ? ”
106848	106871	106872	106872	I	0	“ It ’s okay if I do . I do n’t have to be perfect . Or fashionable . Or even symmetrical . ”
106883	106895	106878	106878	his	151	“ I can just be me . And that ’s enough . ”
106900	106905	106906	106906	Millie	83	“ Are you ready ? ”
106925	106928	106906	106906	Millie	83	“ Definitely . ”
106937	106958	106906	106906	Millie	83	“ Do you think it ’s lame that I ’m wearing the same dress ? Everyone here will recognize it . ”
106959	106964	106965	106965	Winnie	89	“ Not at all , ”
106974	106996	106965	106965	Winnie	89	“ It ’s gorgeous on you , and this time you ’ve got the veil . That totally changes the look . ”
107072	107077	107078	107078	Millie	83	“ Also the sneakers . ”
107085	107094	107082	107082	her	83	“ It ’s a look all your own . ”
107102	107121	107095	107095	I	0	“ Yeah , I could n’t do those heels again . At least they ’re clean and white ! ”
107122	107138	107139	107139	Emmeline	87	“ You look amazing . You ca n’t even see the blood on the dress , ”
107146	107149	107143	107143	I	0	“ Thanks . ”
107190	107207	107182	107182	Audrey	88	“ And your hair is so cute . Good job staying away from the scissors today . ”
107208	107213	107214	107214	I	0	“ You know what ? ”
107223	107252	107214	107214	I	0	“ Believe it or not , I was n’t even tempted . But I think Hutton took all the scissors out of the house yesterday just in case . ”
107444	107450	107451	107451	I	0	“ You all look beautiful , ”
107500	107518	107519	107519	Winnie	89	“ I could not be more proud to have all four of my sisters beside me today . ”
107524	107540	107519	107519	Winnie	89	“ Do n’t do this to me . My mascara is n’t even dry yet . ”
107541	107556	107557	107557	I	0	“ No tears ! We ’re all happy today . Have you seen Hutton ? ”
107566	107590	107561	107561	She	83	“ He looks like a million — sorry — a billion bucks in his suit and tie , but also a little nervous . ”
107591	107605	107606	107606	I	0	“ Yeah , fifty pairs of eyes on him is not his thing , ”
