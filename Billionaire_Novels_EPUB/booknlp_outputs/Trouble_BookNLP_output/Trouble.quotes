6547	6591	6592	6592	Miles	150	“ This … Link Sherlock , despite the ridiculous name , is presenting the world of antiques to a new generation of buyers and collectors . They ’re taking their first sip of coffee milk or venturing into the livestock shows in Branson . ”

25543	25551	25570	25570	Spencer	198	“ I ’m going to feed Chartreuse . ”
25552	25562	25563	25563	I	0	“ Do n’t lose her . Or her eyes . ”
25580	25604	25574	25574	his	198	“ Sorry . Feeding time at the zoo . Did you know that species of tree frog has been around ten million years ? ”
25605	25608	25609	25609	He	198	“ Fascinating . ”
25625	25633	25609	25609	He	198	“ Why is n’t he in school ? ”
25634	25645	25646	25646	I	0	“ That ’s not really your business , is it ? ”
25670	25683	25663	25663	His	198	“ You ’re my business as long as you work for me . ”
25706	25752	25700	25700	I	0	“ His dad ’s kind of a rough guy . He ’s been threatening to take Ollie from his mother , so I told her I ’d keep him with me — in case he shows up again . She ’ll be here Friday night . ”
25753	25762	25793	25793	His	731	“ That sounds dangerous . Is she okay ? ”
25763	25786	25700	25700	I	0	“ I think so . I call her every day to be sure . She said she ’s got it under control . ”
25787	25792	25793	25793	His	731	“ I hope so . ”
25853	25863	25864	25864	He	731	“ I like this look you ’re doing here . ”
25888	25898	25880	25880	I	0	“ Thanks . I was feeling playful this morning . ”
25899	25906	25927	25927	he	731	“ It ’s cute , Rosie . ”
25907	25912	25913	25913	My	0	“ Puppies are cute . ”
26089	26102	26103	26103	He	731	“ This gives new meaning to the phrase ‘ fiery redhead . ’ ”
26116	26126	26108	26108	he	731	“ Who taught you to do all of this ? ”
26127	26142	26108	26108	he	731	“ Shop teacher at school . I ’m the only girl who took welding . ”
26143	26155	26156	26156	He	731	“ You ’re a welder . Daisy ’s daughter plays football . ”
26174	26184	26156	26156	He	731	“ I take it your family enjoys busting stereotypes . ”
26185	26215	26108	26108	he	731	“ We ’re descended from a long line of witches . Do n’t piss me off or I ’ll turn you into a frog and give you to Ollie . ”
26216	26227	26228	26228	He	731	“ I was wondering where he got his little pet . ”
26246	26258	26243	26243	his	731	“ Must be nice to dispose of your enemies so cleanly . ”
26259	26265	26266	26266	I	0	“ It has its moments . ”
26288	26295	26272	26272	he	731	“ Up next is this stuff ? ”
26296	26363	26243	26243	his	731	“ Yep . I ’ll drape it over the frames and fasten it with the clear zip ties . Then I ’ll smooth the flower food and dirt and moss paste on the outside . Once that ’s done , I ’ll thread the flowers through the netting . I ’ll wait until Friday morning so it ’ll be as fresh as possible on Saturday night . ”
26364	26371	26243	26243	his	731	“ How long does it last ? ”
26372	26417	26272	26272	he	731	“ As long as they water it . The paste keeps the flowers hydrated , and I try to select ones that hold up well after cutting . Roses are the worst , but we have to have roses for Beauty and the Beast . ”
26418	26423	26243	26243	his	731	“ Why is that ? ”
26424	26473	26272	26272	he	731	“ The rose is Beast ’s countdown clock . As each petal falls , the time runs out for him to learn to love Belle and earn her love in return . If he does n’t before the last one falls , he ’ll be a beast forever . ”
26559	26565	26555	26555	We	737	“ Does he make it ? ”
26574	26595	26569	26569	I	0	“ In the movie he does . Just barely , though . Belle shows up in time to save him . ”
26610	26619	26603	26603	he	731	“ What about the non - Disney version ? ”
26620	26635	26699	26699	his	731	“ I do n’t know . I like the Disney version of the story . ”
26636	26650	26651	26651	He	731	“ Probably best to get the whole truth before believing in fairy tales . ”
26661	26681	26651	26651	He	731	“ I think you ’ve got it from here . Let me know if you need any more help . ”
26682	26695	26699	26699	his	731	“ Scout ’s coming to help me tomorrow . Thanks , though . ”
26767	26779	26780	26780	Daisy	178	“ Three love boat platters and two pitchers of Natty Light . ”
26829	26841	26817	26817	I	0	“ I ’m going to the bar . Want a martini ? ”
26853	26863	26848	26848	she	178	“ Please . I ca n’t drink Natural Light . ”
27274	27299	27300	27300	Scout	193	“ Sly , remember when we were shearing that topiary back in high school , and you sliced the top layer off your finger ? ”
27309	27314	27300	27300	Scout	193	“ There it is . ”
27315	27319	27320	27320	Joselyn	135	“ Stop it ! ”
27332	27340	27320	27320	Joselyn	135	“ You ’re ruining my tuna nigiri ! ”
27341	27354	27355	27355	He	193	“ Who knew there was so much blood in the old girl ? ”
27386	27394	27395	27395	Daisy	178	“ No blood talk at the table . ”
27428	27431	27432	27432	She	178	“ Yes ! ”
27446	27458	27432	27432	She	178	“ It ’s delicious . I ’m going to savor it . ”
27486	27494	27480	27480	I	0	“ What ’s this about your finger ? ”
27522	27557	27505	27505	She	178	“ This one . Almost sliced it right off with my pruning shears . It must ’ve bled for an hour . I thought I was going to pass out . Ten stitches later … ”
27581	27593	27594	27594	She	178	“ So these sculptures have always been hazardous to your health ? ”
27608	27619	27596	27596	her	178	“ I knew I stopped doing this for a reason . ”
27635	27648	27649	27649	Her	178	“ Brushes with death and dismemberment aside , you ’re an artist . ”
27665	27671	27655	27655	she	178	“ Thank you , Spencer . ”
27672	27686	27649	27649	Her	178	“ Where ’s your little charge this evening ? No sushi for him ? ”
27687	27719	27649	27649	Her	178	“ He ’s actually hanging out with JR ’s son this evening . They played on a little football team together one summer , and they ’ve been friends ever since . ”
27720	27725	27655	27655	she	178	“ And his mother ? ”
27726	27777	27778	27778	I	0	“ Courtney should be here tomorrow afternoon . She said it ’s been a pretty quiet week , so that ’s good news . It ’s really nice of you to ask … and a little surprising . Most people do n’t want to talk about that kind of thing . ”
27799	27817	27786	27786	I	0	“ I try to know my employees ’ situations . Especially if it might impact your performance . ”
27818	27826	27786	27786	I	0	“ I told you it would n’t . ”
27868	27874	27864	27865	the singer	764	“ Red , Red Wine . ”
27894	27901	27902	27902	Scout	193	“ I did n’t do it , ”
27910	27915	27902	27902	Scout	193	“ Scout ’s honor . ”
27916	27924	27925	27925	Joselyn	135	“ You did not just say that , ”
27956	27961	27962	27962	he	150	“ Hello , friends ! ”
27965	27987	27962	27962	he	150	“ Hello , Spencer ! Daisy , I played this song just for you . I heard it ’s your favorite . ”
28012	28038	28004	28004	she	178	“ Miles , I ’m so glad you made it . Did you just get in town ? Have some sushi . There ’s plenty . ”
28039	28045	28046	28046	Scout	193	“ We have to dance . ”
28056	28067	28046	28046	Scout	193	“ Miles played this song just for you , Tink . ”
28068	28074	28075	28075	I	0	“ Miles has impeccable timing , ”
28089	28108	28080	28080	She	178	“ I do n’t know why Daisy hates this song so much . It ’s not that bad . ”
28109	28115	28046	28046	Scout	193	“ It ’s that bad . ”
28116	28133	28134	28134	Her	178	“ What ’s funny is the way she gets so bent out of shape about it . ”
28153	28158	28148	28148	I	0	“ Want to dance ? ”
28175	28178	28168	28168	her	178	“ Sure . ”
28338	28351	28335	28335	I	0	“ You seem to make a habit of flirting with married men . ”
28356	28367	28335	28335	I	0	“ I ’m sorry ? What did you just say ? ”
28368	28380	28381	28381	She	178	“ Yesterday it was John . Today , it ’s Scout … ”
28409	28418	28400	28400	her	178	“ I ’m not flirting with married men . ”
28434	28442	28428	28428	her	178	“ That ’s not how it appears . ”
28470	28474	28475	28475	she	178	“ I see , ”
28478	28483	28475	28475	she	178	“ You ’re jealous . ”
28484	28525	28531	28531	her	178	“ Jealousy is never a good look on anyone . You wo n’t see it on me . I just think as someone who has experienced the pain of infidelity , you would n’t want to inflict it on others . ”
28534	28541	28531	28531	her	178	“ You are such an ass — ”
28542	28550	28475	28475	she	178	“ Yes , I ’ve been told . ”
28551	28609	28531	28531	her	178	“ For your information , Scout and I grew up together . He ’s like a brother to me . I introduced him to Daisy when we were in high school , because they ’re perfect for each other . I practically shoved them into each other ’s arms . I have no interest in him romantically . ”
28610	28614	28615	28615	I	0	“ Or JR ? ”
28644	28653	28639	28639	she	774	“ I stopped crushing on JR years ago . ”
28654	28659	28678	28678	she	774	“ Are you sure ? ”
28660	28666	28639	28639	she	774	“ Why do you care ? ”
28667	28672	28673	28673	Her	774	“ I do n’t . ”
28682	28716	28678	28678	she	774	“ When he got married , those feelings went away . I ’m not a cheater . I never have been . I ’m honest , and I respect other people ’s feelings . ”
28851	28857	28838	28838	I	0	“ You ’re different here . ”
28858	28862	28869	28869	Her	774	“ Am I ? ”
28863	28868	28869	28869	Her	774	“ You laugh more . ”
28883	28907	28879	28879	her	774	“ It ’s my home . I ’m with people I ’ve known all my life . It ’s familiar , I guess . ”
28908	28917	28869	28869	Her	774	“ So why do n’t you move back ? ”
28918	28924	28925	28925	Her	774	“ You sound like Daisy . ”
28930	28971	28925	28925	Her	774	“ I have no interest in moving back to the low - key , ‘ What are you going to do with your life ? ’ all the time . No thanks , I ’d rather have a root canal . ”
28972	28980	28869	28869	Her	774	“ Is this coming from your mother ? ”
28981	29052	29053	29053	Unexpected	196	“ It comes from everybody . They ’re all wonderful when I ’m here for a visit , but if I stay too long , it turns into nonstop pressure to either get married and have kids or to be the best whatever at whatever . No resting on your laurels in Fireside . It ’s much easier to leave and be a failure than to stay and simply exist . ”
29055	29063	29053	29053	Unexpected	196	“ How old are you , Joselyn ? ”
29078	29085	29064	29064	She	774	“ I ’m twenty - five . ”
29086	29107	29158	29158	she	774	“ You ’re hardly old enough to be a failure at anything . Maybe they ’re excited for your potential . ”
29108	29125	29064	29064	She	774	“ You could n’t possibly understand . You ’ve never had to work to prove yourself . ”
29133	29152	29130	29130	my	0	“ You have no idea what my life has been like . No one gets a free ride . ”
29163	29179	29158	29158	she	774	“ I keep forgetting I do n’t know anything about you . I ’m sorry . ”
29201	29206	29207	29207	She	774	“ No harm done . ”
29213	29225	29207	29207	She	774	“ After Saturday , you wo n’t be my boss anymore . ”
29226	29241	29246	29246	her	774	“ It ’s true . It will be the end of our professional relationship . ”
29257	29264	29249	29249	I	0	“ What will you do then ? ”
29265	29277	29207	29207	She	774	“ Back to building my client list , pounding the pavement . ”
29278	29293	29207	29207	She	774	“ If you need help , I write a pretty decent letter of recommendation . ”
29294	29336	29207	29207	She	774	“ I do n’t know if a florist rec will help me , but if you know anyone who needs massage therapy or sports medicine , be sure to send them my way . Or if you ever need it yourself . ”
29337	29347	29348	29348	She	774	“ Done . I like having you under me . ”
29355	29364	29348	29348	She	774	“ That ’s not how I remember it . ”
29436	29510	29511	29511	Her	774	“ You ’re right . We do n’t know each other well , but I believe you ’re an intelligent person . At least , it appears your memory functions properly . In my office I told you I do n’t do relationships . To be completely clear going forward , what I meant is I do n’t sleep with the same woman more than once . I do fucking . Nothing more . ”
29519	29534	29511	29511	Her	774	“ You do fucking . Now , where have I heard that line before ? ”
29535	29595	29745	29745	She	783	“ I ’m sure you ’ve seen it in a movie or you ’ve read it in a book , and you think I ’m not serious or it ’s just a line . Or somehow your magic pussy will change my mind and make me grow a heart or some other form of attachment . It wo n’t . ”
29596	29608	29745	29745	She	783	“ That sounds both very lonely and very risky to me . ”
29609	29627	29511	29511	Her	774	“ I do n’t take risks , and I ’m never alone unless I want to be . ”
29628	29666	29745	29745	She	783	“ I see . Just out of curiosity , why do you find it necessary to have such a rule ? I ’m open to a little no - strings - attached sex every now and then . ”
29667	29735	29745	29745	She	783	“ Ah , but you see , if I ever break my rule , if I ever fuck the same woman twice , suddenly she forgets what I just said . She thinks it happened — her magic pussy has broken the spell , and I ’ve changed my evil ways . That ’s when it all becomes very messy . I also do n’t do messes . ”
29736	29744	29745	29745	She	783	“ You almost sound proud of yourself . ”
29767	29778	29756	29756	her	783	“ I also told you before , I ’m honest . ”
29779	29790	29795	29795	her	783	“ Then it sounds like I ’m wasting your time . ”
29828	29842	29821	29821	I	0	“ Thank you for the dance , Joselyn . Have a good evening . ”
29856	29867	29868	29868	Courtney	163	“ I ’ve got to say , I ’m impressed . ”
29890	29897	29868	29868	Courtney	163	“ Aunt Sly used a blowtorch ! ”
29927	29942	29917	29917	he	165	“ She ’d put it on the metal and Boosh ! Sparks flew everywhere ! ”
29943	29963	29964	29964	I	0	“ I told him not to look at the flame . You did what I said , right Olls ? ”
29993	30005	29985	29985	Courtney	163	“ How did you ever learn to do all of this ? ”
30018	30061	30012	30012	I	0	“ I mostly taught myself . You ’d be surprised what you can learn on YouTube . Then I took some welding classes at school , and I talked to different florists to get advice on which flowers work best in topiaries . ”
30067	30083	30012	30012	I	0	“ I ca n’t believe you did it all by yourself . And so fast ! ”
30084	30100	30101	30102	The asshole	784	“ JR and Scout helped me with the framing — and Spencer , I guess . ”
30118	30151	30104	30104	I	0	“ I ’m nowhere near done . Once I ’m finished with these final roses , I have to make all the arrangements for the tables . Being a florist is work . ”
30152	30160	30161	30161	Court	163	“ Hold up , back it up . ”
30170	30186	30161	30161	Court	163	“ Did I hear you say Spencer helped you ? Mr. Brown Chicken Brown Cow ? ”
30204	30211	30189	30189	his	165	“ I ’m out of here . ”
30223	30233	30212	30212	I	0	“ I guess he knows about everything by now . ”
30234	30279	30218	30219	his mother	532	“ To answer your question , yes . Spencer helped me , and we ’ve been very professional . No funny business at all . In fact , I have it straight from the horse ’s mouth we will not be revisiting his bedroom . ”
30280	30289	30290	30290	she	532	“ Eh , so you ’ll visit yours , ”
30293	30306	30290	30290	she	532	“ Mr. Carrollton says he never sleeps with the same woman twice . ”
30328	30334	30314	30314	she	518	“ That ’s strangely sucky . ”
30517	30553	30512	30512	I	0	“ Fuck Spencer Carrollton . This will all be over tomorrow night , and I can get on with my life . I ’m not wasting any more time running down dead - end roads . ”
30554	30560	30561	30561	Courtney	163	“ That ’s the spirit . ”
30568	30580	30561	30561	Courtney	163	“ How about you ? Any word from Ozzy this week ? ”
30581	30602	30623	30623	her	163	“ Not a peep . Maybe he ’s decided to leave us alone finally . I can hope , right ? ”
30630	30677	30625	30625	she	163	“ We ’re going to do more than hope . We ’re going to find some good men , not abusers or icebergs who only want to screw around and wreck our lives . They ’re out there , and we ’re going to find them . ”
30678	30681	30623	30623	her	163	“ Preach ! ”
30699	30718	30719	30719	She	163	“ Hey , Court , hand me two more of those roses , and I ’ll be done . ”
30756	30762	30763	30763	She	163	“ Where is he now ? ”
30784	30789	30790	30790	Spencer	198	“ Where is who ? ”
30817	30822	30790	30790	Spencer	198	“ Oh , shit ! ”
30834	30839	30840	30840	I	0	“ No … NO ! ”
30910	30915	30916	30916	Courtney	163	“ Oh my God ! ”
30919	30922	30923	30923	Spencer	198	“ Joselyn ! ”
30973	30976	30977	30977	I	0	“ NO ! ”

31094	31099	31088	31088	Spencer	198	“ Are you hurt ? ”
31122	31127	31128	31128	I	0	“ I ’m okay , ”
31191	31196	31174	31174	Spencer	198	“ Look at me . ”
31220	31227	31207	31207	He	198	“ Are you dizzy ? Nauseated ? ”
31228	31231	31232	31232	I	0	“ No … ”
31257	31266	31245	31245	They	796	“ You saved me . You saved everything . ”
31276	31308	31267	31267	Courtney	163	“ You did some pretty impressive acrobatics getting away from it . It ’s more like you saved the flowers . He saved your head from splatting all over the floor . ”
31319	31324	31325	31325	he	198	“ That does it , ”
31328	31345	31325	31325	he	198	“ No more sculptures without a safety net … and a football helmet and metal gloves . ”
31360	31371	31349	31349	I	0	“ Now I remember why I stopped doing these things . ”
31372	31380	31381	31381	His	198	“ They ’re hazardous to your health . ”
31412	31420	31405	31405	I	0	“ Thank you for saving my life . ”
31421	31424	31425	31425	Daisy	178	“ Sly ? ”
31435	31446	31425	31425	Daisy	178	“ What the hell — Spencer ? Are you okay ? ”
31447	31452	31453	31453	Spencer	198	“ Can you stand ? ”
31491	31495	31479	31479	Daisy	178	“ What happened ? ”
31496	31502	31503	31503	I	0	“ Oh , you know , ”
31508	31524	31503	31503	I	0	“ The usual Sly - near - death - experience on a bed of roses . ”
31537	31545	31532	31532	Spencer	198	“ She ’s going to be okay . ”
31546	31560	31561	31561	Scout	193	“ Whoa , what the hell ? What did I miss this time ? ”
31577	31583	31561	31561	Scout	193	“ I ’m really fine . ”
31641	31648	31649	31649	I	0	“ Spencer , are you okay ? ”
31669	31675	31676	31676	His	198	“ Did I break something ? ”
31686	31700	31701	31701	He	198	“ No , it ’s fine . I ’m just catching my breath . ”
31707	31726	31727	31727	Scout	193	“ Is it your ribs ? Ribs ca n’t really be fixed , but we can tape them . ”
31738	31745	31727	31727	Scout	193	“ It ’s not my ribs . ”
31752	31774	31727	31727	Scout	193	“ It ’s an old injury . I tweaked my back playing racquetball with Miles . I probably irritated the muscle . ”
31775	31805	31806	31806	Scout	193	“ If that ’s the case , Sly can help you . She got her degree in sports medicine , massage therapy . Give him the works , Sly . ”
31815	31840	31806	31806	Scout	193	“ I ’m glad to check you out . We can do it here or at my mom ’s … Wherever you feel comfortable . ”
31841	31890	31898	31898	he	805	“ I ’m going to head up to my room and see if I can treat it with ice and heat . I ’ve got a nice jacuzzi tub . If none of that works , I ’ll let you know . I ’m glad you ’re okay . ”
31942	31950	31951	31951	Scout	193	“ That guy is such a dick . ”
31964	31983	31957	31957	I	0	“ That man just saved my life — and the centerpiece for the gala . Show some respect . ”
31984	31993	31994	31994	I	0	“ Ow — don’t hit me , witch . ”
32032	32037	32038	32038	She	178	“ Okay , kids … ”
32046	32077	32040	32040	her	178	“ I ’m glad you ’re okay . If Spencer ’s down for the count , I need you to help me greet our guests . You up for it ? ”
32090	32107	32082	32082	Courtney	163	“ I ’ve got to find my lost boy . Do what you need to do . ”
32148	32154	32155	32155	Spencer	198	“ Ca n’t you read ? ”
32161	32183	32155	32155	Spencer	198	“ Assuming you ca n’t , I ’ll read it for you . It says , ‘ Do not disturb . ’ ”
32356	32361	32362	32362	I	0	“ It does not . ”
32369	32386	32362	32362	I	0	“ It ’s much more polite . It says , ‘ Please do not disturb . ’ ”
32412	32415	32416	32416	he	198	“ Joselyn , ”
32419	32426	32416	32416	he	198	“ What are you doing here ? ”
32427	32432	32433	32433	I	0	“ You ’re hurt . ”
32447	32464	32433	32433	I	0	“ Why did n’t you say something ? Why are you such a stubborn old mule ? ”
32465	32477	32478	32478	His	198	“ I ’m hardly old . I ’m thirty - two . ”
32483	32490	32478	32478	His	198	“ It ’s a good thing . ”
32505	32523	32496	32496	I	0	“ You ’re far more likely to heal faster at your age than if you were older . ”
32524	32539	32478	32478	His	198	“ If I were younger , I would n’t be lying here at all . ”
32540	32597	32598	32598	He	198	“ Spilled milk . You saved my life and the entire gala , and now you ’re lying up here suffering for it , and you wo n’t let anybody help you . It ’s ridiculous and prideful . I brought my bag , and I ’m going to work out that injury . Right now . ”
32616	32637	32598	32598	He	198	“ Is that so ? Who died and made you queen ? How did you get in this room anyway ? ”
32638	32659	32660	32660	He	198	“ Daisy gave me your extra key . Now you ’re going to be still and let me help you . ”
32830	32837	32838	32838	My	0	“ Just relax and stop fighting . ”
32843	32851	32838	32838	My	0	“ What are you going to do ? ”
32885	32900	32874	32874	I	0	“ Lucky for you , I ’m actually very good at treating sports injuries . ”
32970	32982	32983	32983	I	0	“ I ’m going to put my hands on your back . ”
32992	33030	32983	32983	I	0	“ Now , I ’m just going to work out the tension . I ’ll slowly apply more pressure . If it ’s too intense , let me know , and I ’ll ease up . Okay ? ”
33143	33186	33128	33128	he	198	“ I think the strain is located in your gluteus medius . That ’s the muscle that wraps around your left hip . Is it okay if I get closer there ? I ’ll need to manipulate the top of your butt — ”
33187	33196	33203	33203	I	0	“ You have permission to touch my ass . ”
33270	33279	33259	33259	I	0	“ Tell me if it ’s too much . ”
33370	33376	33377	33377	I	0	“ Are you doing okay ? ”
33386	33392	33393	33393	He	198	“ That feels really good . ”
33450	33453	33454	33454	He	198	“ God … ”
33457	33464	33454	33454	He	198	“ That ’s where it is … ”
33481	33484	33467	33467	I	0	“ Better ? ”
33485	33497	33498	33498	I	0	“ I ’m sure it ’ll be great once you stop . ”
33511	33527	33498	33498	I	0	“ I ca n’t tell you how grateful I am to you for saving me . ”
33528	33549	33550	33550	He	198	“ As if I would stand there and let you crash onto the floor . You could ’ve been killed . ”
33562	33568	33550	33550	He	198	“ It was very heroic . ”
33593	33601	33576	33576	I	0	“ Like something out of a movie . ”
33602	33611	33612	33612	He	198	“ Not a Disney movie , I hope . ”
33668	33673	33665	33666	a prince	820	“ Maybe it was . ”
33692	33715	33688	33688	his	198	“ Do n’t get any ideas , Joselyn . I did what I did because it was the right thing to do . ”
33748	33761	33763	33763	my	0	“ Well , I ’m here to try and even the scales . ”
33842	33847	33848	33848	I	0	“ What happened here ? ”
33863	33871	33859	33859	he	198	“ Childhood injury . Leave it alone . ”
33883	33909	33877	33877	I	0	“ Must ’ve been pretty serious to leave a scar like that . Were you cut … or hit ? Was it a car accident ? ”
33910	33918	33859	33859	he	198	“ It ’s none of your concern . ”
33919	33946	33877	33877	I	0	“ Actually , if you have a pre - existing injury , it can be helpful for me to know when I ’m providing future treatment . ”
33947	33961	33962	33962	He	198	“ I wo n’t require future treatment . Thanks for the back rub . ”
34089	34131	34065	34065	I	0	“ You might not feel so great tonight , but the healing should set in overnight . Maybe take some ibuprofen and drink plenty of water . By tomorrow , I think you ’ll feel well enough to attend the gala . ”
34132	34139	34157	34157	I	0	“ I will attend the gala . ”
34140	34156	34157	34157	I	0	“ Great , then I ’ll leave this with you , and here ’s this . ”
34179	34191	34192	34192	I	0	“ You know how to reach me if you need anything . ”
34254	34265	34266	34266	Miles	150	“ You do n’t look any the worse for wear . ”
34308	34329	34297	34297	I	0	“ It ’s not that serious — just a tweak . Besides , I could n’t miss your big event . ”
34623	34629	34613	34613	they	840	“ Red , Red Wine , ”
35109	35116	35117	35118	Rick Brimfield	155	“ Spencer . Here you are . ”
35127	35135	35117	35118	Rick Brimfield	155	“ I ’ve been looking for you . ”
35136	35139	35140	35140	I	0	“ Rick . ”
35146	35151	35140	35140	I	0	“ You made it . ”
35177	35212	35213	35213	His	155	“ Did n’t see you at the welcome dinner last night . Let me guess , you found the only Marilyn in this tiny town and spent the night with her in your room . ”
35225	35243	35219	35219	he	155	“ Actually , I tweaked my back playing racquetball with Miles . Had to call it early . ”
35244	35248	35249	35249	He	155	“ Too bad . ”
35255	35279	35280	35280	He	155	“ This is quite impressive , but I would expect nothing less . Only … What ’s a guy to do with this ? ”
35302	35313	35314	35314	He	155	“ Give it to your wife . Where is Vanessa ? ”
35322	35330	35314	35314	He	155	“ Our divorce was finalized last week . ”
35331	35343	35409	35409	his	155	“ Rick , I ’m sorry . I had no idea . ”
35344	35396	35397	35397	My	0	“ Yeah , fuck all that . You ’ve had the right idea all along . There are far too many hot women in the world to tie myself down to screwing only one . I plan to make up for lost time , starting now . What do you say ? ”
35464	35475	35476	35476	She	178	“ Hey , Rick , I see you found Spencer . ”
35486	35508	35476	35476	She	178	“ He was looking for you last night , Spence . I think Rick wanted to pull an all - nighter . ”
35509	35514	35515	35515	I	0	“ A missed opportunity , ”
35524	35535	35515	35515	I	0	“ You should have sent him out with your husband . ”
35536	35557	35558	35558	Scout	193	“ Nah , thanks , but that ’s never been my style . I ’m a one - woman guy . ”
35592	35599	35600	35600	I	0	“ If you ’ll excuse me . ”
35755	35760	35761	35761	Her	2159	“ You made it . ”
35787	35801	35769	35769	she	2159	“ How ’s the back ? Any better ? I like this tux . ”
35859	35876	35835	35835	she	2159	“ I told you I ’d be here . I ’m a man of my word . ”
35877	35880	35881	35881	Her	2159	“ Yes . ”
35894	35918	35890	35890	her	2159	“ You ’re honest and not nice at all , and you never sleep with the same woman twice . I ’m learning . ”
36007	36021	36001	36001	her	2159	“ Why are you here alone ? You should have brought a date . ”
36027	36036	36037	36037	She	2159	“ I knew I ’d be seeing you . ”
36044	36055	36037	36037	She	2159	“ How did you sleep last night ? Any pain ? ”
36056	36071	36092	36092	she	2159	“ I took an edible . I was asleep ten minutes after you left . ”
36072	36083	36084	36084	She	2159	“ Wait , are you saying you ate some weed ? ”
36114	36131	36092	36092	she	2159	“ THC is a proven anti - inflammatory pain reliever , and there ’s no hangover . ”
36149	36159	36143	36143	I	0	“ Why did n’t you just smoke a joint ? ”
36160	36186	36187	36187	Her	2159	“ It ’s a non - smoking room , Joselyn . Anyway , I do n’t like the smell of smoke , particularly pot smoke . ”
36197	36220	36192	36192	she	2159	“ I ’m not often surprised , but you ’ve surprised me . I never expected you to be such a rebel . ”
36221	36232	36143	36143	I	0	“ I ’ve got seven years on you , Sin . ”
36250	36262	36263	36263	She	2159	“ You ca n’t possibly know all there is to know . ”
36274	36287	36263	36263	She	2159	“ It ’s okay to be vulnerable . You ’ve been hurt . ”
36288	36345	36143	36143	I	0	“ I do n’t do vulnerable . If I appear to be on guard , it ’s because my partner has already seen fit to slap me in the back , and I do n’t know who might try to do it next . Fucking Miles . Probably trying to ensure he wins our next match . ”
36346	36354	36263	36263	She	2159	“ Oh no ! He did n’t ! ”
36355	36359	36263	36263	She	2159	“ He did . ”
36360	36403	36143	36143	I	0	“ I ’ll get Daisy to tell him to stop hitting you in your injury . He seems to listen to her . And I ’m available for follow - up treatments . I told you I ’m rebuilding my client list . ”
36465	36480	36458	36458	She	872	“ You ’re very beautiful tonight . This white and gold combination suits you . ”
36497	36511	36487	36487	she	872	“ Thank you . I know you do n’t give out compliments freely . ”
36512	36528	36487	36487	she	872	“ Only an idiot gives out compliments freely . Or a person who wants something . ”
36529	36544	36545	36545	She	872	“ And you want nothing from me . Do n’t worry . I remember . ”
36647	36658	36638	36638	She	872	“ So you ’re saying you want to be friends ? ”
36673	36719	36664	36664	her	872	“ I ’m saying I want to treat you . I know we have a history , but I really do respect your boundaries . As your therapist , they would be my boundaries as well … and Lord knows I could use the work . ”
36735	36745	36729	36729	she	872	“ Why do you care so much , Joselyn ? ”
36770	36822	36765	36765	She	872	“ Remember that old fable about the lion who was going to eat the mouse , but in the end let him go ? Then later , when the lion had been captured by hunters , that same mouse showed up and chewed through the ropes and set the lion free ? ”
36823	36840	36765	36765	She	872	“ Everyone knows that story . I do n’t know how it applies to this situation . ”
36841	36856	36857	36857	She	872	“ No act of kindness , no matter how small , is ever wasted . ”
36866	36875	36857	36857	She	872	“ I owe you one . Or several . ”
36876	36884	36765	36765	She	872	“ I release you from your debt . ”
36885	36912	36857	36857	She	872	“ You ca n’t do that . The universe knows , and if I do n’t repay you , my karma will be all messed up . ”
36957	36971	36972	36972	She	872	“ Your position is giving me a massage is going to repay me ? ”
36983	37005	36972	36972	She	872	“ Perhaps while I ’m healing your muscles , you might let me heal whatever else is strained … or broken . ”
37006	37020	37091	37091	She	872	“ I ’m trying to decide if your suggestion is dirty or presumptive . ”
37021	37050	37091	37091	She	872	“ I ’m not being dirty at all . I ’m being serious . Maybe I can show you it ’s safe to step outside that frozen castle . ”
37051	37062	37091	37091	She	872	“ Why do I feel like this is more Disney ? ”
37063	37090	37091	37091	She	872	“ It ’s only Disney if you ’re a tiny princess with magical powers . I do n’t think that ’s the case , is it ? ”
37113	37116	37104	37104	I	0	“ No . ”
37123	37128	37129	37129	I	0	“ Are you angry ? ”
37203	37206	37209	37209	her	872	“ Spencer ? ”
37227	37282	37225	37225	Miles	150	“ Here you are . I need you to lose the scowl and show a little love to Grafton . Heather is here , but she ’s pissed because of something Rick apparently said . I think he ’s been over - served , and now he ’s hitting on all the single women . ”
37283	37290	37291	37291	I	0	“ Get Daisy to do it , ”
37294	37298	37291	37291	I	0	“ My back — ”
37299	37309	37310	37310	Miles	150	“ Oh , look , there he goes again . ”
37320	37339	37312	37312	his	150	“ Although I ’m pretty confident Daisy ’s cousin can kick his ass . She ’s a pistol . ”
37391	37402	37403	37403	Rick	155	“ Oh , hey , I see you know Spencer … ”
37412	37422	37403	37403	Rick	155	“ Wait a minute … What ’s going on ? ”
37423	37434	37437	37437	Miles	150	“ Why do n’t we go and have some bread ? ”
37450	37456	37437	37437	Miles	150	“ What are you doing ? ”
37484	37492	37478	37478	Her	880	“ What are you doing , Joselyn ? ”
37493	37511	37512	37512	Her	880	“ What are you doing is more like it ? How dare you manhandle me this way . ”
37524	37532	37517	37517	I	0	“ What do you want from me ? ”
37603	37633	37587	37587	her	880	“ Thank you for liking my dress . I want you to call me when you ’re ready for your next treatment . Our professional relationship is n’t over . ”
37837	37842	37823	37823	She	880	“ Joselyn , wait . ”
37873	37886	37859	37859	She	880	“ Have you decided to stop being an asshole to me now ? ”

37938	37952	37953	37953	She	880	“ You need massage therapy , and I never sleep with my clients . ”
37956	37976	37953	37953	She	880	“ I ’m not your client . I have n’t hired you , but if you want me to … ”
38004	38012	37998	37998	her	880	“ That sounds very much like blackmail . ”
38013	38036	38044	38044	her	880	“ Only if you ’re interested in the work . You can always say no , and I ’ll let you go . ”

39174	39184	39168	39168	I	0	“ I take it you ’re a boob guy . ”
39198	39235	39190	39190	he	198	“ I ’ve never really thought about it before . Until a witchy redhead waltzed into my life with a body to make any man weep and a brain sharp enough to make it all unfair . ”

39943	39964	39927	39927	She	333	“ Why are you doing the walk of shame ? Did n’t Daisy get you a room at the hotel ? ”
39965	39972	39927	39927	She	333	“ I told her not to . ”
39973	39982	39927	39927	She	333	“ So where have you been all night ? ”
39983	39999	40000	40000	She	333	“ Sleeping with a random hot guy , of course . What do you think ? ”
40066	40073	40051	40051	She	330	“ I love him , Ma . ”
40087	40095	40051	40051	She	330	“ God , I ’m so stupid . ”
40096	40104	40105	40105	She	330	“ Whoa , hang on right there . ”
40116	40137	40105	40105	She	330	“ That ’s a lot of information to drop on somebody out of the blue at five in the morning . ”
40138	40145	40051	40051	She	330	“ It ’s closer to six . ”
40169	40183	40149	40149	I	0	“ Either way , start at the beginning . Who is this guy ? ”
40184	40190	40105	40105	She	330	“ He works with Daisy . ”
40201	40228	40195	40195	I	0	“ God , he ’s such an asshole . He ’s gorgeous and rich and he has the perfect body , and he is the worst . ”
40229	40238	40149	40149	I	0	“ And he ’s already making you cry ? ”
40239	40246	40247	40247	I	0	“ I ’m making myself cry . ”
40256	40285	40247	40247	I	0	“ He ’s been nothing but straight with me . He has a rule . He never sleeps with the same woman twice . Want to know why ? ”
40301	40348	40349	40349	She	915	“ Because as soon as he sleeps with a woman twice , he says she thinks her , quote , ‘ magic pussy , ’ end quote , has changed him and he ’s going to leave behind his wicked ways out of love for her . ”
40359	40368	40349	40349	She	915	“ He actually said the P - word ? ”
40392	40404	40385	40386	My mom	330	“ Last night I slept with him for the second time . ”
40437	40465	40420	40420	I	0	“ No , no , no ! That ’s the whole point . If I go there , then it ’s confirming what he said , right ? ”
40484	40524	40477	40477	she	915	“ Dang . This guy is some kind of special asshole . He ’s got it all fixed so even if he breaks his own rules , you ca n’t do anything about it or you prove him right . ”
40525	40530	40531	40531	I	0	“ Yee - up . ”
40538	40555	40531	40531	I	0	“ I want to strangle him … When I ’m not dreaming of having his babies . ”
40556	40563	40564	40564	My	0	“ Is he good in bed ? ”
40575	40587	40570	40570	I	0	“ I ’ve slept with him twice , have n’t I ? ”
40600	40644	40593	40593	she	917	“ Baby , I wish I could save you , but you got that gene straight from me . They ’re always irresistible . Your father was like that . He was a smart asshole , and the smart assholes are the worst . ”
40645	40655	40656	40656	My	0	“ You never told me Dad was an asshole ! ”
40706	40762	40763	40763	She	923	“ Your dad was a gorgeous , red - headed Scot , and I loved him from the moment he spoke to me in that accent . That man made me wet … then I discovered he was a notorious playboy , and I nearly took his head off . Then he changed his ways . ”
40799	40807	40796	40796	she	923	“ What made him change his ways ? ”
40808	40833	40763	40763	She	923	“ I showed him I ’d walk away . He decided he ’d rather hold onto me than continue his life as a tomcat . ”
40834	40840	40841	40841	I	0	“ You were a badass . ”
40846	40850	40841	40841	I	0	“ A witch . ”
40851	40873	40763	40763	She	923	“ I ’m not sure if I ’m as badass as you … I seem to keep giving in to him . ”
40874	40880	40841	40841	I	0	“ Do n’t do it . ”
40918	40950	40916	40916	Alice	208	“ Lord have mercy , Regina . One of these days I ’m just going to sit on that bottom step out there and holler until you come and get me . ”
40974	40982	40968	40968	She	208	“ What ’s the matter , Alice ? ”
40994	40997	40989	40989	her	330	“ Rheumatism ? ”
40998	41023	41024	41024	She	330	“ Old age - ism . Sly , is that you ? My goodness , you look just like a young Ann - Margret . ”
41033	41087	41024	41024	She	330	“ Elvis had a real thing for her . Almost did n’t marry Priscilla because of it . Everybody hated her for it , but she came out on top . Elvis was a big cheater , and she ’s still kicking from what I understand . Mmm … Good coffee , Reggie . ”
41088	41096	41097	41097	Ma	140	“ What brings you around so early ? ”
41115	41135	41136	41136	She	140	“ Could n’t sleep . I ca n’t sleep past five - thirty anymore — because I ’m old . ”
41143	41151	41136	41136	She	140	“ Enjoy your youth while you can . ”
41202	41216	41192	41192	my	0	“ Whoa , what ’s under your shirt here ? A back brace ? ”
41217	41220	41221	41221	Her	140	“ Oh ! ”
41239	41277	41278	41278	She	140	“ Got me some of those Skims . It ’s like a stretchy girdle made out of this slick material . That little Indian girl with the good birthing hips sells ’em . How do I look ? ”
41294	41307	41285	41285	I	0	“ You look amazing . But … Do you mean Kim Kardashian ? ”
41308	41321	41322	41322	She	140	“ That little girl who looks like Cher , except … fuller . ”
41337	41368	41322	41322	She	140	“ If you ask me , Cher always looked like she needed to eat a whole pizza all by herself . I like that little girl ’s shape . Womanly . ”
41369	41377	41378	41378	I	0	“ Why do you think she ’s … ”
41384	41390	41378	41378	I	0	“ She ’s actually Armenian . ”
41391	41419	41322	41322	She	140	“ Well , I do n’t care what tribe she ’s affiliated with . I believe in supporting women - owned businesses , minority - owned businesses — ”
41420	41434	41322	41322	She	140	“ I mean , she ’s not native — not that it matters . ”
41435	41446	41378	41378	I	0	“ She ’s the same thing as Cher , right ? ”
41447	41454	41322	41322	She	140	“ Right , they ’re Armenian . ”
41464	41488	41455	41456	Ms. Alice	208	“ Are you telling me Cher ’s not … but she had that song where she dressed up like … and her hair … ”
41489	41502	41503	41503	She	208	“ If it helps , Armenians are still considered a minority group . ”
41521	41540	41513	41513	I	0	“ My work here is done . I ’m going to see if I can sleep another hour . ”

41636	41646	41626	41626	I	0	“ Maybe I need to start making stretchy girdles . ”
41658	41686	41653	41653	she	208	“ Hey , Sly — have you seen that old book of ours ? The Fireside Women ’s Society book ? Daisy thought you might have it . ”
41704	41726	41694	41694	she	208	“ Ahh … I do n’t know . It might have gotten mixed up in my stuff . I can check . ”
41727	41774	41694	41694	she	208	“ Well , if you do , just bring it back next time you come . I do n’t want anything to happen to it . That book is a historical record . It ’s a powerful thing when women come together to help each other . ”
41775	41782	41783	41783	I	0	“ I ’ll look for it . ”
41794	41797	41798	41798	I	0	“ Joselyn ? ”

42516	42551	42581	42581	he	150	“ Oh , come now . You left a trail of fire in your wake when you pulled her out of the gala . Rick actually apologized to me for hitting on your girlfriend . ”
42552	42559	42581	42581	he	150	“ She ’s not my girlfriend . ”
42560	42574	42575	42575	He	150	“ Sorry , sorry … I know , no girlfriends . Only protégés . ”
42587	42609	42575	42575	He	150	“ I suppose travel is out until you ’re recovered ? No worries . I ’ll work it out with Grafton . ”

42963	43012	43013	43013	Her	956	“ First , you can call me Spencer . Let ’s not be obtuse . As for my pain , it only hurts when I move in certain directions , and then it ranges from one to five , depending on whether or not I ’m lifting something . ”
43032	43063	43026	43026	she	956	“ This is your second treatment . Based on how you feel this week , we can decide how many more are needed and the amount of time between them . ”
43127	43135	43136	43136	She	956	“ How ’s the client building going ? ”
43152	43164	43136	43136	She	956	“ Pretty slow . Would you prefer lavender oil or peppermint ? ”
43165	43177	43178	43178	She	956	“ Considering it ’s the beginning of the day , peppermint . ”
43322	43331	43332	43332	My	0	“ Should I remove my pants as well ? ”
43353	43356	43357	43357	She	956	“ No ! ”
43365	43387	43357	43357	She	956	“ I ’ll just tuck this in your waistband . It ’ll protect your pants , and the oil is washable . ”
43388	43404	43357	43357	She	956	“ I ’d rather not walk around with oil stains on my clothes all day . ”
43405	43416	43419	43419	I	0	“ It wo n’t happen . I ’m very careful . ”
43592	43610	43589	43589	her	956	“ When you treated me in my hotel suite , you talked me through the entire procedure . ”
43611	43643	43589	43589	her	956	“ I did n’t want you to get the wrong idea . Now that we ’ve worked together , you can sleep if you want . It does n’t bother me . ”
43648	43656	43646	43646	me	0	“ What wrong idea would I get ? ”

43709	43715	43729	43729	Her	956	“ So I ’ve heard . ”
43798	43815	43784	43784	I	0	“ It ’s quite a move from flowers to massage therapy . What prompted that jump ? ”
43816	43884	43886	43886	she	956	“ It ’s not such a jump if you think about it in terms of service . I ’ve always wanted to lift people ’s spirits , make them smile , or ease their suffering . Flowers led to aromatherapy and learning which scents eased anxiety and elevated the mood . That dovetailed into healing , which is how massage therapy works , and here I am . ”
43907	43915	43889	43889	she	956	“ You need to breathe through it . ”
44050	44056	44045	44045	I	0	“ Are we finished here ? ”
44057	44060	44061	44061	Her	956	“ Yes . ”

44090	44097	44067	44067	she	956	“ Thank you for your time . ”
44105	44113	44067	44067	she	956	“ I ’ll change in my bathroom . ”
44114	44123	44124	44124	She	956	“ I ’ll see you in a week . ”
44173	44186	44169	44169	She	956	“ Your payment will be in your Venmo account in the hour . ”
44187	44191	44192	44192	Her	956	“ Thank you . ”

44591	44625	44626	44626	He	165	“ She uses them to scare off predators . If she were in the forest , she ’d blend with the leaves . If something gets too close , her eyes pop up . ”

44705	44734	44694	44694	He	165	“ People think frogs are poisonous , but they ’re not . They have toxins on their skin to protect them , but it wo n’t kill you . ”
44735	44738	44739	44739	He	165	“ Wait … ”
44759	44770	44746	44746	I	0	“ So you ’re saying that little lady is toxic ? ”

45135	45154	45063	45063	she	163	“ Yeah , and I ’ve talked to his teachers . They ’re all aware of the situation . ”

45341	45366	45335	45335	She	163	“ What if we renewed the restraining order ? You said the first one had expired … Maybe we could get a permanent one . ”
45367	45385	45386	45386	She	163	“ What good is a piece of paper if he ’s determined to get what he wants ? ”
45404	45421	45422	45422	Her	163	“ I wo n’t leave you alone . If anything , you ’ve got me here . ”

45697	45736	45737	45737	She	989	“ You are not a yo - yo . You ’re an intelligent woman with a killer bod . You could get any man you wanted , and you deserve one who will treat you like a queen . ”

46160	46170	46188	46188	I	0	“ Then I wo n’t be your client anymore . ”
46171	46182	46183	46183	I	0	“ I guess we wo n’t see each other anymore . ”

46244	46270	46241	46241	I	0	“ They do . We could certainly continue along those lines . Usually it ’s a monthly type thing , but it could be biweekly . ”
46271	46281	46282	46282	Hazel	192	“ But then I ’d still be your client . ”
46288	46298	46282	46282	Hazel	192	“ I ’m not particularly happy with this arrangement . ”

47876	47904	47819	47819	I	0	“ I will not be working with Courtney . You are my massage therapist , and you will remain so for as long as I need you . ”

48060	48083	48013	48013	Her	1017	“ So you just go from woman to woman , no feelings attached ? Does n’t that chip away at your soul ? ”
48084	48108	48013	48013	Her	1017	“ My soul is quite well . Do n’t tell me you ’ve become one of them — thinking you can change me . ”
48109	48117	48118	48118	She	1017	“ You said it ’s not possible . ”
48154	48160	48150	48150	I	0	“ I wo n’t change . ”

48709	48745	48691	48691	I	0	“ He said if I thought I could beat him , I was a fool . He said no friend of mine could stop him . He said no piece of paper could stop him … ”

48790	48801	48779	48779	she	1021	“ He grabbed me , but I pushed him away . ”

48988	49000	48982	48982	I	0	“ And you really think we ’re safe sleeping here tonight ? ”
49009	49038	49006	49006	she	1021	“ He did what he came here to do — he ’s trying to scare me . Anyway , where would we go ? And Ollie ’s asleep … ”
49066	49107	49108	49108	She	1021	“ We ’ll lock the deadbolt and check all the windows . I have pepper spray and a baseball bat . If we all sleep in the same room , we can keep each other safe if anything does happen . ”
49144	49154	49155	49155	she	1021	“ I ’m so glad he slept through it , ”
49160	49179	49155	49155	she	1021	“ I ca n’t believe I missed it . It ’s like he knows our schedules or something . ”

49262	49299	49234	49234	I	0	“ We have strength in numbers , and we ’ll get this all sorted . I ’ll check apartment listings while we ’re at it . We ’re not exactly in the greatest part of town . ”

57494	57498	57479	57479	I	0	“ Mr. Santiago ? ”
57617	57628	57629	57629	It	1211	“ Miss Winthrop , I ’ve been waiting for you . ”
57677	57691	57669	57669	I	0	“ Looks like you know as much about my job as I do . ”
57692	57701	57702	57702	He	1207	“ I ’ve spent time with massage therapists . ”
57716	57724	57702	57702	He	1207	“ I ’ll just get started then . ”
57740	57748	57730	57730	I	0	“ Would you prefer peppermint or lavender ? ”
57749	57758	57702	57702	He	1207	“ Neither , if you do n’t mind . ”
57773	57787	57764	57764	I	0	“ You said the pain is coming from a lower back strain ? ’ “
57790	57810	57764	57764	I	0	” Rubbing my hands together , I start with light strokes on his shoulders slowly making my way down . “
57823	57846	57764	57764	I	0	” I ’m quiet , working steadily , focusing on my hands . I assume he ’s fallen asleep when he speaks . “
57852	57866	57850	57850	yourself	0	” It ’s an odd question , but I do n’t mind answering . “

57953	57973	57974	57974	I	0	” I ’ve answered this question before , and I start to relax as I talk about my goals . “
58011	58012	57974	57974	I	0	” “
58020	58067	58014	58014	you	0	” His question is forceful and a little confusing , jumping back to why I came here . I return to my original assumption he ’s foreign — perhaps he ’s looking for a way to make friends ? But he works in this busy office . “
58071	58102	58014	58014	you	0	” Clearing my throat , I move my hands into what he said was the injured part of his back , deepening the pressure . He does n’t even flinch . “
58109	58110	58014	58014	you	0	” “
58115	58134	58014	58014	you	0	” My shoulders tense , and I step back , picking up my towel and wiping my arms . “
58143	58144	58145	58145	You	170	” “
58152	58189	58145	58145	You	170	” It ’s a smooth observation , a smile in his voice , almost like he ’s leading me with his words . Picking up my bag , I take another step away from the table . “
58198	58199	58192	58192	you	170	” “
58237	58314	58214	58214	I	0	” My heart leaps to my throat , and I bolt for the door , throwing my bag over my shoulder as I run . Ozzy is off the table like a jaguar , nearly catching me . The whisper of his hand just missing my arm causes me to shriek , and I grab the doorknob , jerking it open . It ’s just enough delay for him to grab the back of my scrubs . “
58317	58513	58214	58214	I	0	” I scream , falling on my stomach in the hallway . Clawing the floor , I manage to get my feet under me and pull myself up before he can land on top of me . Running as hard as I can to the door , I fling everything I pass in the way behind me — a chair , a potted tree , the computer screen off the receptionist ’s desk . It lands with a massive crash . If I ’m lucky , there ’s a security camera . Otherwise , whoever owns this office is going to be confused when they come into work tomorrow . Slamming the doors of the suite , I see his shadow rising up in the frosted glass , and I drag a long , metal planter in front of it . He hits it with a slam , and I run hard to the elevator , pressing the button repeatedly , looking back over my shoulder , crying out as I pant for breath . He ’s almost through the door , and I give up , scanning all over the place for the stairs . “
58518	58691	58692	58692	Joselyn	135	” My eyes land on the sign for the restrooms . Deciding I do n’t have time to wait , I run full - speed into what turns out to be an enormous stone facility . A powder area with sinks and a full - length mirror divides the front from the 12 stalls in the back . It ’s empty and dark , and I run to the middle stall , pushing open a door and quickly sliding the lock before crawling , military - style on my belly under the dividers to the very last one . I lock that door as well and step carefully onto the toilet seat . I do n’t know if he saw me come in , and I clutch my hand over my mouth to muffle my breathing , straining my ears for any sound of footsteps . Tears stream down my cheeks . I ’m winded , and every snort , every heavy exhale feels magnified a thousand times in this stone enclosure . “
58694	58715	58692	58692	Joselyn	135	” Ozzy sing - songs my name like it ’s a horror film , and more tears coat my face . “
58732	58765	58726	58726	I	0	” He slaps the doors open , one by one , and I squeeze my eyes shut , praying to God and the saints , and the Fireside ladies to help me . “
58778	58793	58767	58767	you	135	” Slam ! He pushes another door open , slowly moving down the row . “
58815	58821	58822	58822	He	1222	” Slam ! Another door … “
58839	58849	58833	58833	he	1222	” Slam ! He ’s one door away from … “
58884	58901	58879	58879	you	135	” Clink … He ’s at the door I locked , and my eyes squeeze shut . “
58915	59124	58903	58903	you	135	” At the first Boom ! of his boot striking particleboard , I step down from the toilet , sliding the lock slowly open . Another Boom ! and my lips squeeze shut against a scream . As soon as he breaks through that wrong door , I plan to run as hard as I can for the exit . It ’s my only hope of escaping . It ’s got to work . My fingers grip the handle for his last kick when Woosh ! The toilet behind me automatically flushes . I jerk the door open and our eyes meet . His glitter with satisfaction , but I swing my bag of massage oils , warming saucer , and rocks with all my might , aiming for his head as I run directly at him . He ’s taken aback that I ’m running at him , and the bag strikes his temple , throwing him to the ground . On the way down , he grabs my leg , and I go down , too , striking my cheek against the stall divider . Light explodes behind my eyes , and I roll onto my back with a moan . Ozzy pushes off the floor . “
59132	59277	58903	58903	you	135	” The sound of his voice spikes adrenaline in my veins , and I shake off my disorientation . I ’m on my feet again , snatching up my bag and running at top speed for the exit . Sticky blood is on my cheek , but I do n’t stop running . I ’m in the marble foyer , and I see the sign for the stairs . Bursting through the doors , I run around and around , gasping for air , exhaling little cries of fear , flying as fast as I can down all twenty - two floors to the bottom . I slam the metal crash doors open and do n’t even pause for the security guard . I ’m in the parking lot , in Betsy , screeching away towards the apartment . We ca n’t stay there tonight .
59417	59442	59409	59409	Joselyn	135	“ Sorry I ’m late . Traffic this morning was crazy , and it took me a little longer to get out the door … ”
59474	59479	59454	59454	she	1225	“ What the hell ? ”
59491	59498	59480	59480	I	0	“ What happened to your face ? ”
59499	59508	59509	59509	She	1225	“ It ’s nothing . I ’m fine . ”
59539	59545	59515	59515	I	0	“ How did this happen ? ”
59546	59552	59553	59553	She	1225	“ I just … fell . ”
59628	59634	59635	59635	My	0	“ What made you fall ? ”
59643	59646	59635	59635	My	0	“ Spencer … ”
59665	59682	59654	59654	she	1225	“ It ’s nothing for you to worry about . I ’ve got it under control . ”
59695	59704	59689	59689	I	0	“ Did he do it ? The husband ? ”
59705	59753	59654	59654	she	1225	“ It was n’t like that . It was my own stupid fault . I took an appointment with an unknown client . I should never have gone alone to an office building after hours for someone I do n’t know . It ’s just common sense . ”
59766	59771	59689	59689	I	0	“ What office building ? ”
59772	59777	59689	59689	I	0	“ Member ’s Mark . ”
59778	59784	59689	59689	I	0	“ Where is he now ? ”
59785	59791	59689	59689	I	0	“ I do n’t know . ”
59798	59863	59792	59792	She	1225	“ We went to the police station and filed a complaint . Since he did n’t actually hit me , and I went there to meet him without being coerced , they ’re saying there ’s little they can do . I ran from him , and when he tried to catch me , I fell and hit my cheek on the bathroom stall . ”
59864	59876	59877	59877	She	1225	“ You were in the women ’s restroom … with him ? ”
59896	59920	59921	59921	She	1225	“ You ’re not going back to that apartment . You ’re not going out of my sight until this situation is resolved . ”
59925	59935	59921	59921	She	1225	“ And how do you propose we resolve it ? ”
59936	59964	59965	59965	Her	1225	“ It ’s very easy . You ’re going to pack your things and move into my house until we find you a better place to live . ”
59976	59992	59970	59970	I	0	“ No arguments . Tell Courtney and her son . I have plenty of room . ”
59993	60017	60018	60018	My	0	“ Courtney will not go for this . Ollie has school , and she already said he ’ll find her wherever she goes . ”
60065	60140	60058	60058	I	0	“ Our office has security on call for when we ’re transporting expensive items . I ’ll tell them I need a man at my house around the clock until further notice . Better yet , I ’ll have him assigned to you until further notice . You ’ll be perfectly safe — as long as you do n’t do anything foolish like taking appointments from clients you do n’t know . Even then … ”
60141	60210	60211	60211	Her	1236	“ I needed the money , Spencer . And I ’m not having a security guard following me around like I ’m the damned Queen of England . I have an interview this afternoon with Palmetto Rehab . If they give me a job , they ’ll have security on - site , and then I wo n’t need to take any more clients I do n’t know . ”
60240	60251	60218	60218	I	0	“ Did you report what happened to Member ’s Mark ? ”
60252	60255	60218	60218	I	0	“ No . ”
60256	60270	60218	60218	I	0	“ They need to know exactly what happened , when , and where . ”
60271	60289	60290	60290	Her	1236	“ It was all so fast . I have n’t really had a chance to process everything … ”
60318	60322	60323	60323	I	0	“ Come here . ”
60336	60371	60323	60323	I	0	“ You ’re okay now . I ’ve got you . We ’re going to find this guy and get him behind bars . In the meantime , you ’ll be safe with me . ”
60372	60388	60403	60403	her	1236	“ I ca n’t do that , Spencer . I do n’t belong to you . ”
60410	60441	60403	60403	her	1236	“ It ’s not about belonging . It ’s about your safety — and Courtney ’s . Men like that typically do n’t stop until they have what they want . ”
60453	60506	60448	60448	he	1238	“ I ca n’t commit to something like that without talking to Court , and if she ’s not onboard , I ca n’t leave her alone . I promised I ’d stay with her , and we ’ve been doing okay . We have a patrol car driving by every night — ”
60560	60577	60578	60578	She	1239	“ Call her now and ask her . I ’ll talk to her myself if necessary . ”
60655	60658	60659	60659	Her	1239	“ Court ? ”
60670	60702	60665	60665	she	1239	“ Hey … I ’m just at my appointment with Spencer . He ’s kind of angry . He wants us to live with him until Ozzy ’s off the streets . ”
60708	60718	60703	60703	She	1239	“ I know , that ’s what I said . ”
60760	60785	60754	60754	she	1239	“ He says there ’s plenty of room , and they have this on - call security guard . I know it ’s silly … ”
60806	60822	60794	60794	she	1239	“ What ? You think it ’s a good idea ? Yeah , hang on . ”
60835	60844	60830	60830	she	1239	“ She ’d like to talk to you . ”
60856	60861	60849	60849	I	0	“ Hi , Court . ”
60862	60867	60868	60868	Courtney	163	“ Hey … um … ”
60874	60892	60868	60868	Courtney	163	“ You ’d be willing to let us stay at your house ? What ’s the catch ? ”
60939	60943	60944	60944	I	0	“ No catch . ”
60958	61006	60944	60944	I	0	“ I have two bedrooms on the first floor of my house no one is using . It ’s basically the same size as your apartment , so it should be sufficient for you , Oliver , and Joselyn . You wo n’t even notice me upstairs . ”
61007	61025	61112	61112	Her	1242	“ Ollie has to go to school . It ’s all the way back where we live . ”
61026	61048	61112	61112	Her	1242	“ Would it be possible for him to homeschool the last month ? I can call the principal if it helps . ”
61049	61056	61057	61057	My	0	“ Why are you doing this ? ”
61076	61111	61071	61071	I	0	“ I do n’t like seeing people I care about with black eyes . I do n’t like menacing cowards . Take the help I ’m offering and do n’t over - think it . ”
61117	61140	61112	61112	Her	1242	“ Okay . Thank you . I ’m sorry — I do n’t have many people I can count on right now . ”
61141	61157	61165	61165	Her	1242	“ You have Joselyn , and I hope you trust me to keep you safe . ”
61158	61164	61165	61165	Her	1242	“ I think I do . ”
61219	61275	61211	61211	I	0	“ Let ’s skip the massage today . I ’ll take you to the Member ’s Mark building to file a report , and I ’ll drive you to your interview . Allied said they ’ll have a man assigned to us by 6 pm . I can keep an eye on you until then . ”
61375	61390	61391	61391	She	1242	“ This is the guy you expected to save you if anything went wrong ? ”
61399	61426	61391	61391	She	1242	“ The appointment was on the top floor . I was n’t expecting him to save me . I was expecting him to be a deterrent . ”
61427	61437	61438	61438	I	0	“ He ’s only a deterrent to a Twinkie . ”
61458	61466	61443	61443	my	0	“ Hello , Doug , is it ? ”
61467	61470	61471	61471	He	1246	“ Hi ! ”
61479	61501	61471	61471	He	1246	“ That ’s me . Doug . What can I do you for ? Do you need assistance finding a floor ? ”
61502	61515	61516	61516	I	0	“ How did a guy like him get a job in security ? ”
61536	61539	61522	61522	Joselyn	135	“ Stop . ”
61546	61566	61567	61567	Doug	232	“ You are so sweet , Doug . I actually need to see Mr. Santiago . Is he in ? ”
61581	61610	61573	61573	his	232	“ Do n’t I know you ? You were here this weekend … yesterday ? That ’s a pretty bad shiner you got there . Are you okay ? ”
61631	61652	61626	61626	Joselyn	135	“ Yes , I was here yesterday , and I need to talk to Mr. Santiago if he ’s available . ”
61653	61658	61659	61659	Doug	232	“ He should be . ”
61666	61705	61659	61659	Doug	232	“ Oh … Oh , my bad , he ’s not . It says Basil Santiago is in New York until next week . I ’m sorry . Say , were n’t you here to see him yesterday ? ”
61706	61709	61710	61710	Joselyn	135	“ Yeah . ”
61727	61731	61732	61732	I	0	“ She was , ”
61740	61758	61732	61732	I	0	“ She had an appointment in Santiago ’s office . When did he leave for New York ? ”
61769	61779	61780	61780	He	235	“ It says he ’s addressing the United Nations … ”
61789	61800	61780	61780	He	235	“ He left on Friday . He stood you up ? ”
61817	61841	61810	61810	Joselyn	135	“ Thanks , Doug . I actually found an intruder in Mr. Santiago ’s office , so I wanted to file a complaint . ”
61842	61845	61846	61846	His	235	“ Oh ! ”
61852	61858	61846	61846	His	235	“ Oh no , Miss … ”
61859	61873	61810	61810	Joselyn	135	“ Winthrop . Her last name is Winthrop , and if you think — ”
61874	61877	61878	61878	Joselyn	135	“ Doug , ”
61881	61942	61878	61878	Joselyn	135	“ Listen to me . A man used Mr. Santiago ’s office to schedule a fake appointment with me yesterday . I need you to circulate a memo that the offices need to do a better job locking up on the weekends , and I ’m going to send a letter to Mr. Green . The building needs better security . ”
61952	61982	61943	61943	Doug	232	“ I ’m sorry … They do n’t like it if we ask too many questions or hassle the visitors . They do n’t want us to seem unwelcoming — ”
61996	62007	61991	61991	Joselyn	135	“ Do better , Doug . I believe in you . ”
62025	62036	62008	62008	She	1252	“ You ’re going to let him off the hook ? ”
62037	62042	62043	62043	She	1252	“ He ’s right . ”
62051	62083	62043	62043	She	1252	“ A building this size is n’t going to question visitors . I had a name , an office number . It ’s normal to assume I had a legitimate appointment . ”
62084	62093	62008	62008	She	1252	“ Assume ? You could ’ve been killed . ”
62094	62123	62130	62130	I	0	“ It ’s not a building with only one office like Antiques Today . I do n’t want to get Doug fired . It ’s not his fault . ”
62138	62146	62130	62130	I	0	“ It ’s not your fault either . ”
62157	62195	62147	62147	She	1252	“ I knew not to come here . My gut told me it was the wrong thing to do , but I ignored it . This is just as much my fault as it is Doug ’s . ”
62200	62204	62147	62147	She	1252	“ I disagree . ”
62205	62228	62232	62232	I	0	“ Either way , I ’ve got an interview in thirty minutes . Are you going to drive me there or argue ? ”
62333	62337	62338	62338	My	0	“ You okay ? ”
62356	62375	62350	62350	I	0	“ Yes , I ’m going to drive you to your interview . Now get in the car . ”
62379	62385	62338	62338	My	0	“ This place is incredible . ”
62395	62441	62390	62390	she	1252	“ Did you see that garden tub in the bathroom ? I ’m going to take the longest jacuzzi - bath evah ! I might not come out . Girl , you ’ve seriously got to hang onto this guy . He is a keeper . ”
62464	62504	62452	62452	she	1252	“ He ’s not my guy to hang onto . I told you . He ’s been very up front from the beginning . He does n’t do relationships , and I do . We ’re at an impasse . ”
62505	62519	62532	62532	her	1252	“ But you said he ’s super - hot in bed , right ? ”
62535	62584	62528	62528	I	0	“ It does n’t matter . I ’m not repeating the same mistakes I made with Elliot . I gave up my independence and turned into someone I was n’t , and look how that ended . He was fucking his secretary , and I was getting screwed . ”
62585	62600	62601	62601	She	1252	“ This guy is definitely not Idiot Flick , and I do n’t know … ”
62622	62637	62616	62616	Bambi	237	“ Ca n’t you sort of , have a little fun while it lasts ? ”
62638	62687	62688	62688	She	1252	“ Last time I slept with him , I sneaked out because I wanted to curl up in his arms and hold him forever . That is how I get screwed . He can love it and leave it , but I get attached . I want more . ”
62699	62743	62690	62690	her	1252	“ Say what you want , the way he freaked out over your shiner and moved us all in here in less than twenty - four hours tells me a lot . Mr. ‘ I do n’t do relationships ’ has it bad . ”
62750	62786	62746	62746	I	0	“ I ca n’t build my life around wishful thinking . I can only go off of the facts , and the facts are he ’s said plainly and repeatedly , Do n’t get attached . ”

63077	63085	63063	63063	He	165	“ Koalas are marsupials … like kangaroos . ”

63107	63123	63098	63098	I	0	“ Maybe you can graduate high school early and be one of those child geniuses . ”

63169	63205	63156	63156	Courtney	163	“ You only have a few weeks left , and we need to stay with Mr. Spencer right now . It ’s kind of the best thing . But you ’ll still pass your grade . ”

63915	63943	63944	63944	Spencer	198	“ If you need anything , if anything feels off , if you hear any strange noises . If you see a shadow you do n’t like . ”

65184	65197	65168	65168	Joselyn	135	“ In case you missed it , I do n’t have children . ”
65198	65218	65257	65257	she	1301	“ Still , it was groundbreaking . Revolutionary . An all - black Marvel movie ? It kicked ass . ”
65219	65235	65236	65236	I	0	“ Marvel … that ’s the comic book franchise ? I prefer more sophisticated films . ”
65241	65250	65251	65251	She	1301	“ He ’s getting too far ahead again . ”
65263	65306	65257	65257	she	1301	“ That ’s where you ’re wrong . The Marvel cinematic universe is deeply complex . People dismiss it because of all the explosions , but the movies ask real , philosophical questions . They comment on the state of the world … ”
65307	65323	65324	65324	I	0	“ Yes , I ’m sure they ’re art house quality . Would you please ? ”
65360	65369	65370	65370	Joselyn	135	“ Black on white or white on black ? ”
65376	65396	65370	65370	Joselyn	135	“ What do you think , Ollie ? Are they black stripes on white or white stripes on black ? ”
65413	65422	65370	65370	Joselyn	135	“ I think it ’s white on black . ”
65423	65432	65433	65433	Joselyn	135	“ They have so much white , though . ”
65447	65456	65439	65439	I	0	“ My vote is for black on white . ”
65486	65492	65482	65482	Oliver	165	“ They ’re like robots . ”

65537	65559	65532	65532	she	1301	“ You ca n’t leave us in here . I need you to stay where I can see you , okay ? ”

65873	65888	65862	65862	I	0	“ It ’s possible I have more in common with Oliver than you know . ”

65970	65977	65965	65965	Oliver	165	“ Can we get ice cream ? ”
65978	65982	65983	65983	I	0	“ Of course . ”
65996	66016	65983	65983	I	0	“ I can check in with Julian and see if he can whip something up for us after dinner . ”

66040	66064	66028	66028	His	165	“ Not every day . He usually cooks dinner three days a week , and I cover the rest with leftovers or takeout . ”
66065	66076	66077	66077	I	0	“ Do n’t you know how to cook for yourself ? ”
66090	66105	66085	66085	I	0	“ I hate to disappoint you , but my culinary skills are rather limited . ”
66106	66111	66112	66112	Oliver	165	“ What ’s cuuli … ”
66120	66128	66112	66112	Oliver	165	“ Culinary means of or for cooking . ”

66146	66162	66163	66163	Joselyn	135	“ Actually , I make a mean grilled cheese . I can also scramble eggs … ”

66188	66212	66213	66213	We	1317	“ I do n’t make them at the same time . Honestly , I ca n’t remember the last time I cooked anything . ”
66270	66275	66276	66276	Ollie	165	“ Mom ’s home . ”

66352	66388	66389	66389	Her	1326	“ You do n’t have to thank me . I had a free day , and I was n’t going to let the two of you wander around the zoo alone . That seems careless . ”
66454	66461	66462	66462	Ollie	165	“ Tree frogs ca n’t swim . ”
66477	66498	66462	66462	Ollie	165	“ They have to get water through their skin . They use mucus on their feet to help them climb . ”

66725	66740	66741	66741	Ollie	165	“ You know moist is Number 2 in Buzzfeed ’s Top 12 grossest words . ”
66759	66765	66741	66741	Ollie	165	“ What ’s Number 1 ? ”
66766	66776	66777	66777	I	0	“ I ’ll tell you when you ’re older . ”

67086	67105	67078	67078	Ollie	165	“ You ’re nice to my mom and Aunt Sly . That means you ’re good , right ? ”
67147	67155	67156	67156	Spencer	198	“ Are you worried about being good ? ”
67170	67173	67174	67174	Ollie	165	“ Sometimes . ”

67249	67276	67278	67278	his	198	“ I think it sucks . My friends have good dads , and I do n’t . I think it means I should n’t have kids . ”

67370	67413	67414	67414	Ollie	165	“ I think we all have the potential to be good or bad , even your dad . From what I ’ve seen of you with your mother , I think it ’s far more likely you ’ll be a good dad . ”

68696	68703	68704	68704	He	136	“ Still , here it is . ”
68756	68768	68748	68748	he	1365	“ This is n’t about Courtney . This is about you . ”
68780	68787	68773	68773	he	136	“ Is this a new record ? ”
68794	68805	68773	68773	he	136	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . ”
68806	68828	68770	68770	his	136	“ We were together three weeks before you moved in — has it even been four weeks since we split up ? ”
68829	68835	68836	68836	I	0	“ It ’s been longer . ”
68844	68859	68836	68836	I	0	“ Even if it had n’t , I knew him before I met you . ”
68860	68875	68876	68876	My	0	“ I see you found a new sugar daddy to take care of you . ”
68883	68898	68876	68876	My	0	“ That is not what ’s happening . He ’s helping Courtney and Oliver — ”
68899	68911	68912	68912	Elliot	136	“ And you just happen to be along for the ride . ”
68924	68932	68912	68912	Elliot	136	“ Or is he getting the ride ? ”
68933	68937	68938	68938	My	0	“ You asshole . ”

69132	69140	69141	69141	I	0	“ Just somebody I used to know . ”

69374	69399	69422	69422	he	198	“ I ’m saying I do n’t like that guy . If he ’s a client , I do n’t want you treating him . ”
69400	69414	69415	69415	His	198	“ Maybe you do n’t have the right to say that to me . ”
69429	69439	69422	69422	he	198	“ Maybe not , but I ’m saying it . ”
69440	69456	69422	69422	he	198	“ You know who else said I could n’t treat male clients ? Fucking Elliot . ”
69457	69504	69505	69505	We	1379	“ I ’m not saying you ca n’t treat male clients . I ’m saying you ca n’t treat that male client . He ’s an asshole . He made you cry , and if I see him again , I ’ll punch his lights out . ”
69539	69547	69548	69550	Tom the Tank	241	“ If you ’re all done here . ”

69927	69946	69922	69922	I	0	“ No . I ’m on the quest for some more of that ice cream . Or something . ”
69995	70019	69988	69988	his	198	“ I ’m sure there ’s ice cream left in the freezer . I told Julien to get enough to last a week . ”

70188	70194	70185	70185	he	198	“ My father was abusive . ”
70220	70233	70217	70217	he	198	“ He beat my mother so many times , I lost count . ”
70247	70279	70239	70239	he	198	“ No matter how hard I begged her , she would never leave him , so I thought I could protect her myself . That ’s when he started beating me . ”
70309	70315	70303	70303	He	198	“ How old were you ? ”
70316	70330	70331	70331	I	0	“ I was Ollie ’s age when they took me away from them . ”
70351	70373	70347	70347	I	0	“ They took you away from your father ? The antiques legend ? I thought he left you all this money … ”
70374	70409	70426	70426	he	1391	“ That would be my foster father , Drake Carrollton . My real father was a drunk abuser named Daniel Keane . My birth name was Spencer Keane . Drake had it legally changed . ”
70434	70470	70421	70421	He	1391	“ For two years , I would have black eyes , unexplained bruises , cuts … The county finally stepped in when he hurt me so badly , I had to go to the ER . ”

70527	70603	70604	70604	His	1391	“ Drake Carrollton was n’t a good man either . He was n’t even a legend as much as he was a hoarder . He was a dusty old dragon who lived for finding and amassing treasure . He procured me because he was smart enough to know he needed an heir , and I suppose he saw some value in having a helper as he got older . No love was lost between us . ”
70672	70715	70716	70716	Spencer	249	“ He taught me all about this stuff , taught me the worth of every piece . When he died , I was able to catalog his estate and turn it into even more money than he had when he was alive . ”
70725	70757	70716	70716	Spencer	249	“ He never traveled ; he never lived his life . He stayed in his cave , clutching his gold like it would ever love him . All these precious things . ”
70758	70768	70769	70769	My	0	“ Is that why they mean nothing to you ? ”
70775	70788	70769	70769	My	0	“ They ’re only things , Sin . Forgotten pieces of junk . ”
70789	70805	70806	70806	He	249	“ Sometimes they ’re more . Sometimes they have meaning — heirlooms , wedding rings … ”
70817	70820	70828	70828	he	249	“ Sometimes . ”
70865	70881	70860	70860	he	249	“ I did n’t have anything else to do , so this became my life . ”
70882	70891	70894	70894	my	0	“ You could have more if you wanted . ”
70901	70910	70911	70911	His	249	“ You could have love , a family … ”
70915	70956	70911	70911	His	249	“ My father was an abuser , which means I ’ll likely be one too . I do n’t know if that capability is in me . Perhaps it ’s not , but I ’m not willing to find out . ”
70957	70995	70860	70860	he	249	“ You ’re not an abuser . I ’ve been with you ; I ’ve seen how you are with the people you care about . I ’ve seen how you are with me , with Ollie . ”

71012	71060	71061	71061	His	1396	“ Of thoughts ? Everyone has thoughts , Spencer . I have thoughts of wanting to kill Ozzy for threatening my friend , for menacing me , for ruining his little boy ’s life . Today I actually fantasized throwing that box in Elliot ’s stupid face . ”
71072	71081	71066	71066	he	1396	“ That was Elliot . Good to know . ”
71082	71098	71121	71121	his	1396	“ My point is , thoughts are n’t actions . You would never hurt me . ”
71099	71117	71121	71121	his	1396	“ Perhaps . I ’ve never allowed myself to be in a situation I could n’t control . ”
71140	71155	71131	71131	I	0	“ You would n’t . The beast never hurt Beauty . Hades worshipped Persephone — ”
71176	71211	71164	71164	He	1396	“ It ’s a good analogy . I know the darkness in myself , what I can be , what I ’ve wanted to do . I ’m not capable of a normal life . ”
71212	71224	71233	71233	him	1396	“ How would you know if you never let yourself try ? ”
71239	71243	71244	71244	He	1396	“ I know . ”
71249	71254	71244	71244	He	1396	“ Goodnight , Joselyn . ”
71768	71780	71781	71781	Her	1421	“ You ’re not broken , you ’re only badly bruised . ”

76876	76880	76881	76881	Ollie	165	“ Going where ? ”
76892	76900	76881	76881	Ollie	165	“ Aunt Sly , my stomach hurts . ”
76912	76927	76928	76928	He	1483	“ You do n’t have a fever . Do you feel nauseated ? Crampy ? ”
76939	76945	76928	76928	He	1483	“ I want my mom . ”
76946	76957	76928	76928	He	1483	“ Your mom had to work this morning , babe . ”
76982	77001	76974	76974	he	1483	“ She ’ll be back after lunch . Want me to see if I can find you something ? ”
77002	77008	77010	77010	my	0	“ I ’m not hungry . ”
77059	77081	77082	77082	He	1483	“ Just stay in bed , and I ’ll try to find something to help . Do you like ginger tea ? ”
77106	77116	77117	77117	I	0	“ I know , let me find some Sprite . ”
77710	77720	77721	77721	I	0	“ You do n’t have to be this way , ”
77796	77799	77783	77783	My	0	“ Courtney ? ”
78049	78054	78055	78055	I	0	“ Oh , God , ”
78058	78065	78055	78055	I	0	“ Please keep my friend safe . ”
78323	78327	78311	78311	I	0	“ What happened ? ”
78349	78355	78356	78356	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
78381	78395	78366	78366	Tom	252	“ Take her to her room . Nobody goes anywhere until further notice . ”
78428	78433	78422	78423	one person	1525	“ Are you okay ? ”
78444	78450	78451	78451	She	163	“ What did he do ? ”
78464	78472	78474	78474	her	163	“ Courtney , tell me what happened . ”
78499	78504	78505	78505	I	0	“ It ’s okay , ”
78517	78521	78505	78505	I	0	“ Just breathe . ”
78577	78594	78559	78559	she	163	“ Sly … Would you be willing to take Ollie ? If something happened to me . ”
78607	78611	78602	78602	she	163	“ Would you ? ”
78630	78634	78635	78635	Her	163	“ What happened ? ”
78639	78647	78635	78635	Her	163	“ Ozzy wo n’t bother us anymore . ”
78673	78677	78678	78678	It	1528	“ Why not ? ”
78707	78716	78699	78699	she	163	“ I shot him . He ’s dead . ”
78717	78722	78699	78699	she	163	“ Oh , God . ”
78814	78824	78825	78828	The mean old bastard	1532	“ Well , that sure is a nice suit . ”
78858	78861	78854	78854	I	0	“ Yes . ”
78869	78873	78854	78854	I	0	“ It is . ”
78930	78941	78942	78942	He	1532	“ I guess that means you ’re a rich man . ”
78954	78963	78942	78942	He	1532	“ So what do you want from me ? ”
78994	79010	79011	79011	He	1532	“ Last time I saw you , the police were taking me to the hospital . ”
79018	79026	79011	79011	He	1532	“ What ? You want an apology ? ”
79034	79051	79052	79052	He	1532	“ My forgiveness is not available . No , I ’m here out of morbid curiosity . ”
79058	79066	79052	79052	He	1532	“ What do you want to know ? ”
79080	79096	79077	79077	him	1532	“ Were you the same with every woman or was it just with my mother ? ”
79134	79146	79147	79147	He	1532	“ I met your mother when I was twenty years old . ”
79160	79202	79147	79147	He	1532	“ They let me out of the army after I helped liberate Kuwait , and I went home to find this pretty little lady with a big heart . She wanted to help me . She loved me to the end . ”
79203	79222	79223	79223	His	1532	“ An end you helped her find . She died as a result of the injuries you caused . ”
79277	79292	79293	79293	He	1532	“ I guess you boss people around now . Is that right , boy ? ”
79303	79310	79293	79293	He	1532	“ You do n’t boss me . ”
79324	79345	79311	79311	I	0	“ Be thankful for that glass . Striking me now would be your last mistake . Now answer my question . ”
79375	79434	79368	79368	he	1532	“ Looks like you got a bit of the old man in you after all . Is that what ’s got you worried ? Afraid you ’ll turn out like me ? Do n’t want to give up your fancy suit , your cushy lifestyle ? Do n’t get cocky , boy . Half of you is me . ”
79515	79525	79504	79504	I	0	“ I do n’t see anything I recognize here . ”
79553	79561	79548	79548	he	1237	“ You ’re no better than me . ”
79562	79575	79548	79548	he	1237	“ Actually , I am . I just needed to see it . ”
80259	80269	80270	80270	My	0	“ Why could n’t you have given me that ? ”
80460	80477	80485	80485	I	0	“ You taught me to be cold like you , and I was a star pupil . ”
80566	80576	80577	80577	Heather	171	“ He does such a good job on repairs . ”
80601	80612	80577	80577	Heather	171	“ You ca n’t even tell a stone was replaced . ”
80613	80632	80584	80584	her	171	“ It ’s an unusual piece . I ca n’t say I would ’ve picked it out myself . ”
80650	80665	80666	80666	Heather	171	“ True . It ’s not the most romantic ring I ’ve ever seen . ”
80674	80683	80666	80666	Heather	171	“ It has a fierce quality , though . ”
80684	80687	80688	80688	My	0	“ Fierce . ”
80699	80706	80697	80697	Joselyn	135	“ It ’s a good description . ”
80707	80730	80666	80666	Heather	171	“ Just so you know , my middle name is Lynn , which can be a boy or a girl ’s name . ”
80747	80762	80742	80742	I	0	“ You can hold the baby names . I ’m not proposing with this . ”
80763	80768	80769	80769	Her	171	“ You ’re not ! ”
80779	80796	80774	80774	she	171	“ Then why are you here ? I told you I ’d bring it to you . ”
80797	80820	80742	80742	I	0	“ I had some business to settle in Providence . It was just as easy for me to collect it from you . ”
80821	80834	80835	80835	I	0	“ What business ? Are you stepping out on me , Spence ? ”
80840	80849	80835	80835	I	0	“ It ’s not hard to say the R. ”
80850	80863	80742	80742	I	0	“ Stop changing the subject . What were you doing in Providence ? ”
80864	80886	80891	80891	her	1596	“ Wrapping up some family business . I would expect by now you ’d know we deal with Grafton before anyone . ”
80894	80904	80891	80891	her	1596	“ Being careful is what keeps me on top . ”
80905	80911	80912	80912	I	0	“ Yes , I know . ”
80926	80968	80921	80921	her	1596	“ I ’m not giving it to you like this . I have a box and tissue . I ’ll wrap it up and make it look nice . Maybe then … if you ’re lucky , she ’ll accept it . ”
81019	81030	81010	81010	I	0	“ Sorry , Heather . I ’ve got to go . ”
81065	81076	81077	81077	Courtney	163	“ He asked if I would meet him for coffee . ”
81254	81273	81244	81246	The female lawyer	1613	“ You agreed to meet your ex - husband for coffee knowing he had a history of violence ? ”
81274	81293	81244	81246	The female lawyer	1613	“ It was in a coffee shop . Tom was always with me . I did n’t think — ”
81294	81324	81325	81325	Courtney	163	“ Exactly , Mrs. Clayton . You did n’t think , which is precisely why you wo n’t speak in your defense . They ’ll rip you to shreds . ”
81361	81371	81372	81372	Her	163	“ He said he wanted to talk about Oliver . ”
81394	81406	81372	81372	Her	163	“ I thought I could get him to leave us alone . ”
81407	81414	81415	81416	The woman	2628	“ And how did that go ? ”
81447	81466	81444	81444	she	2628	“ He told me I was moving home with him . He said I could n’t hide forever . ”
81476	81483	81467	81472	One of the younger male lawyers	1617	“ Tell me , Mrs. Clayton — ”
81484	81491	81492	81492	Courtney	163	“ If you do n’t mind , ”
81496	81524	81492	81492	Courtney	163	“ I do n’t go by that name anymore . I use my maiden name now . It ’s Shaw . You can call me Miss Shaw . ”
81525	81528	81529	81530	The guy	2555	“ Sorry . ”
81535	81552	81529	81530	The guy	2555	“ Miss Shaw , can you tell me how the gun was introduced into the situation ? ”
81553	81577	81578	81578	Courtney	163	“ I did n’t mean to take it out . I was leaving , going to my car , and he followed me . ”
81587	81622	81583	81583	she	163	“ He grabbed my arm , and my bag fell . It hit the ground and he saw it . That ’s when he lunged for it , but I beat him to it . ”
81623	81640	81641	81642	The guy	2555	“ So he saw the gun in your bag and tried to take it from you ? ”
81645	81669	81641	81642	The guy	2555	“ Yes . I did n’t want him to get it because it ’s registered to me . I did n’t trust him . ”
81670	81685	81686	81688	The older woman	1621	“ So you never at any time intended to kill your ex - husband ? ”
81760	81781	81754	81754	they	1622	“ We ’re your lawyers , Miss Shaw . Whatever you tell us is protected by attorney - client privilege . ”
81809	81852	81798	81798	She	163	“ The last time Ozzy came to my apartment and threatened to kill me , I bought the gun . So I guess you could say I bought it specifically for him . I just never knew when I ’d use it . ”
81860	81869	81870	81870	Courtney	163	“ How was your first appointment at Palmetto ? ”
81893	81924	81882	81882	She	163	“ It was really great , actually . Mrs. Wolfe is a sweet old lady , and it was cool having someone taking care of all the paperwork for me . ”
81925	81937	81870	81870	Courtney	163	“ I really appreciate you taking over my clients this week . ”
81938	81948	81949	81949	I	0	“ Yeah , well , we need the money . ”
81959	81982	81949	81949	I	0	“ I would say you ’re too upset , but I do n’t think that ’s true . What ’s going on ? ”
81992	82020	81983	81983	She	163	“ I talked to Ollie . He ’s so happy being in Fireside . Jesse is out of school already , so they ’ve been playing together . ”
82021	82031	82081	82081	she	163	“ You have n’t given up , have you ? ”
82032	82057	81983	81983	She	163	“ No , I ’m feeling good . Spencer texted me to be strong , and Ollie said he went to see him yesterday — ”
82058	82062	82081	82081	she	163	“ He did ? ”
82087	82095	82081	82081	she	163	“ He still has n’t called you ? ”
82096	82111	82072	82072	She	163	“ It ’s okay . I ’m sure he has a lot going on . ”
82119	82137	82081	82081	she	163	“ What did you say ? He texted you to be strong ? What does that mean ? ”
82138	82158	82081	82081	she	163	“ I do n’t know exactly . He just said he was working on new information for the defense . ”
82159	82165	82081	82081	she	163	“ And he visited Ollie ? ”
82166	82197	82081	82081	she	163	“ Ollie said he dropped by yesterday . They fed Chartreuse , then they walked to Daisy ’s house . Ollie was fussing because he had to play with Melody . ”
82216	82223	82210	82210	I	0	“ That ’s … really sweet . ”
82224	82244	82245	82245	She	1626	“ Yeah , he told him not to worry about me , that he was taking care of us . ”
82254	82276	82245	82245	She	1626	“ I want to be pissed at him for ghosting you , but he ’s so damn good to my son . ”
82286	82313	82281	82281	I	0	“ Do n’t be mad at him for me . I broke my own rules sleeping with him again . I should be mad at myself . ”
82325	82345	82317	82317	I	0	“ If he helps get you out of this , I ’ll be willing to forgive him for disappearing . ”
82357	82378	82379	82380	The bailiff	1628	“ In this preliminary hearing of the people versus Courtney Shaw , the honorable Beverly Wright presiding , all rise . ”
82528	82549	82519	82519	She	1642	“ Miss Shaw left her husband without notice , taking their young son away in the middle of the night . ”
82561	82597	82554	82554	she	2628	“ When he tried to meet with her about sharing custody of the child , she pulled a gun on him . He attempted to wrestle it away from her , and she shot him . ”
82629	82659	82660	82661	The woman	2628	“ Your honor , we can establish a pattern of abusive behavior on the part of Mr. Clayton . Miss Shaw filed numerous restraining orders , which he violated . ”
82673	82697	82660	82661	The woman	2628	“ These photographs were taken just one month ago when Clayton showed up at the defendant ’s apartment and attempted to strangle her . ”
82698	82706	82710	82710	her	2268	“ What are you asking , counsel ? ”
82725	82776	82722	82722	her	2628	“ This is a clear case of self - defense . The prosecution has no one bringing charges against Miss Shaw . The victim was a criminal with no one to vouch for him . Miss Shaw acted in self - defense . We ’re requesting all charges be dropped . ”
82788	82842	82785	82785	his	1651	“ Your honor , that ’s outrageous . We still have laws in this country . A man can not be shot in cold blood and nothing done about it . We ’re requesting a trial for first - degree murder . No bail , as Miss Shaw is clearly a flight risk . ”
82878	82945	82871	82872	her lawyer	1652	“ Your honor , there is no reason to hold Miss Shaw without bail . She has a job , clients , a son . If she were a flight risk , she would already have run . She clearly believes in the system and justice . We ’re asking you to simply review the facts of this case and decide what is clear to see . ”
82960	82976	82953	82954	the judge	2268	“ I ’ll take a five - minute recess to review the defendant ’s case . ”
83013	83027	82998	82998	I	0	“ She ’s going to see the truth . I know she is . ”
83035	83046	82998	82998	I	0	“ I hope so . I hope it ’s enough . ”
83210	83214	83200	83201	the bailiff	1628	“ All rise . ”
83257	83310	83250	83250	her	266	“ It is the opinion of this court Mrs. Clayton acted in haste when she met with her husband last week , armed with a loaded weapon . I ’m not convinced she had reason to believe he would harm her that day or she would not have gone to meet him . ”
83364	83402	83358	83358	her	1671	“ I do think Mrs. Clayton was in a difficult situation , but she did n’t pursue the proper remedies to help herself . She did n’t file for divorce ; she did n’t seek sole custody — ”
83403	83411	83358	83358	her	1671	“ Your honor , if you please . ”
83420	83432	83358	83358	her	1671	“ Miss Shaw did file for legal separation on August 27 — ”
83433	83450	83451	83452	The judge	2268	“ If she was able to do that , she was able to finish the process . ”
83455	83496	83451	83452	The judge	2268	“ She did n’t leave Columbia or even behave in a manner that would suggest she feared for her life . She continued going to work , sending her son to the same school , living in the same apartment . ”
83497	83544	83358	83358	her	1671	“ Your honor , she was attempting to maintain a normal life . She had to work in order to pay her bills . Miss Shaw is not independently wealthy . She ’s a poor , single mother with no family nearby , no support system . ”
83545	83558	83559	83560	The judge	2268	“ Regardless , a man lost his life violently in my city . ”
83566	83599	83559	83560	The judge	2268	“ Based on the information before me here today , I see no reason to dismiss the charges of first - degree murder , and I hereby set a trial date for — ”
83627	83650	83651	83651	Spencer	198	“ Your honor , my apologies , if you would please wait . I have new information that will impact your decision . ”
83710	83714	83715	83716	The prosecutor	1653	“ I object ! ”
83722	83743	83719	83719	her	1653	“ Your honor , we have no idea what this new information might be or who this person even is . ”
83761	83785	83751	83751	he	2268	“ If you would just take a moment , your honor . I came straight from the Dentsville Magistrate with a notarized confession . ”
83810	83839	83840	83840	She	163	“ I ’ll call a ten - minute recess while we examine this new information . Bailiff , please provide copies to the prosecution and her defense team . ”
83894	83916	83890	83890	he	198	“ … hired a private detective the day she came to my house . He ’s been following Clayton for weeks … ”
83948	83964	83934	83934	Courtney	163	“ Do n’t worry . That piece of paper should wrap this up pretty quickly . ”
84005	84008	84009	84009	His	198	“ Joselyn — ”
84021	84025	84017	84018	the bailiff	1628	“ All rise . ”
84064	84122	84051	84051	I	0	“ I spoke to the judge in Dentsville , and it appears these documents are in order . Mr. Carrollton ’s private investigator uncovered a conspiracy to kidnap Miss Shaw and take her to a second location where this man had agreed to bury her body . He confessed under oath in exchange for a commuted sentence . ”
84123	84126	84133	84134	my friend	518	“ Oh ! ”
84145	84150	84137	84137	I	0	“ Oh , God . ”
84169	84175	84176	84177	The judge	2268	“ Order in my courtroom . ”
84180	84229	84176	84177	The judge	2268	“ In view of this new evidence , I dismiss the charge of first - degree murder against Miss Shaw . She has confessed to shooting her husband , but as this document establishes imminent danger , I will commute that charge and expunge this from her record . ”
84322	84327	84312	84312	she	163	“ He did it . ”
84335	84347	84328	84328	Her	163	“ He saved us , just like he said he would . ”
84440	84454	84427	84427	Courtney	163	“ Can I go now ? I really want to see my son . ”
84455	84473	84429	84429	her	163	“ You are free to leave , Miss Shaw . It was a pleasure working with you . ”
84474	84478	84479	84479	Courtney	163	“ Thank you . ”
84482	84491	84479	84479	Courtney	163	“ Thank you , Spencer . So much . ”
84527	84536	84537	84537	Spencer	198	“ Joselyn , do you have a minute ? ”
84568	84583	84562	84562	she	163	“ I ’ll just call Ollie and tell him we ’re on our way . ”
84650	84665	84632	84632	He	198	“ Your text said you wanted to talk when I got back in town . ”
84676	84698	84666	84666	He	198	“ I did n’t know if you meant now or if you wanted to wait until you came back from Fireside . ”
84711	84719	84709	84709	him	198	“ You could have texted me then . ”
84720	84725	84726	84726	He	198	“ Should I have ? ”
84766	84797	84760	84760	he	198	“ Only you can answer that question , Spencer . I have to go . Courtney wants to see her son , and it ’s a two - hour drive . ”
84798	84815	84816	84816	He	198	“ Maybe we can have a drink when you get back . Best martinis in town ? ”
84845	84886	84833	84833	My	0	“ When you told me about your childhood , I was sad . I understood your walls , because you were taught not to love . Maybe you do n’t even think you deserve love , but you ’re wrong . “
84950	85011	85014	85014	my	0	“ But I ca n’t , and I ca n’t keep hoping for something you told me was n’t possible . I wish I could ’ve been the woman to make you want more , because I do want more . So this is goodbye . I hope you have the life you want , and I wish you well . ”
85040	85054	85055	85055	Tom	252	“ I checked all the rooms , and I reset the alarm codes . ”
85069	85090	85055	85055	Tom	252	“ It ’ll prompt you to enter a new code when I leave . Then it ’ll just be you . ”
85091	85097	85098	85098	My	0	“ Thank you , Tom . ”
85199	85202	85203	85203	Tom	252	“ Sir ? ”
85213	85216	85207	85207	I	0	“ Yes ? ”
85217	85269	85270	85270	My	0	“ I just wanted to say , it was a great thing you did today . I ’ve always thought of myself as something of a silent hero , keeping people safe , but you were the real Tony Stark swooping in there like you did and shutting down that judge . ”
85281	85288	85275	85275	I	0	“ I was only the messenger . ”
85289	85333	85270	85270	My	0	“ You were more than that . You hired the private eye , you chased down the evidence , and I do n’t know , but I ’m sure you had to grease a few palms to get a notarized confession that fast . ”
85346	85358	85340	85340	I	0	“ No laws were broken in the liberation of Miss Shaw . ”
85366	85380	85359	85359	He	1714	“ Either way , I just wanted to say it before I left . ”
85398	85403	85381	85381	He	1714	“ Thanks , Tom . ”
85404	85432	85433	85433	Her	1716	“ Also … it ’s none of my business , but I think Miss Winthrop is a great gal . You two seem like a good match . ”
85494	85508	85483	85483	he	1719	“ Tom , you ’ve been in this business a while , yes ? ”
85509	85516	85542	85542	His	1719	“ Yes sir , seven years . ”
85517	85541	85542	85542	His	1719	“ Tell me , have you ever done something you thought would make everyone happy then ultimately felt like you screwed up everything ? ”
85553	85616	85547	85547	he	1719	“ I ’m not sure in what way you mean , but I did rescue a kitten once . I took care of it , fed it for two weeks , took it to the vet … Only to find out later it belonged to a little girl around the way who ’d been crying for two weeks over her lost pet . ”
85631	85652	85547	85547	he	1719	“ I thought Joselyn would be happy about what I did . Instead , I feel like I lost her . ”
85653	85671	85672	85672	I	0	“ Well , you did take off without a word . She was n’t happy about that . ”
85686	85692	85672	85672	I	0	“ Did she say something ? ”
85693	85700	85701	85701	He	1721	“ She did n’t have to . ”
85714	85726	85701	85701	He	1721	“ She has the fire that shoots out of her eyes . ”
85734	85741	85730	85730	me	0	“ I should have called her . ”
85742	85747	85748	85748	He	1721	“ You never did ? ”
85760	85776	85748	85748	He	1721	“ No , I was … taking care of old business . Exorcising old demons . ”
85793	85798	85777	85777	He	1721	“ Do you mind ? ”
85799	85808	85809	85809	He	1721	“ Of course not . Have a seat . ”
85814	85843	85809	85809	He	1721	“ You ’re a smart guy , and clearly you have a lot of money . I ’m guessing you know how to make deals and handle people . ”
85844	85847	85848	85848	I	0	“ Usually … ”
85890	85956	85991	85991	He	1727	“ Women like to know you ’re thinking about them . They want to feel important to you , like they matter . You fucked that up , if you do n’t mind me saying so , but maybe , if she really cares about you as much as it looks like she does … A grand gesture would be a good place to start . ”
85957	85961	85962	85962	I	0	“ Grand gesture . ”
86004	86015	86016	86016	He	1727	“ What you did for Miss Shaw was pretty grand . ”
86023	86049	86016	86016	He	1727	“ Maybe you could do some groveling . Women also like being reminded when they ’re right , because trust me , they usually are . ”
86053	86063	86064	86064	My	0	“ He did n’t even try to stop you ? ”
86256	86269	86239	86239	I	0	“ He just stood there and let me walk out the door . ”
86290	86295	86296	86296	She	163	“ Cup of Ambition . ”
86309	86313	86304	86304	her	163	“ Maybe Coffee , ”
86318	86357	86296	86296	She	163	“ I just ca n’t get over that . When he came by yesterday , he seemed so different . Whatever he said or did , he is not the same man I met at Daisy ’s wedding . ”
86358	86366	86367	86367	I	0	“ He ’s always sweet around Oliver . ”
86375	86422	86367	86367	I	0	“ That ’s what ’s so infuriating about him . He ’s incredible with Ollie . He swoops in like a superhero to rescue Courtney … and yet he lacks these basic human skills of just saying goodbye or returning my text when we ’re apart . ”
86462	86500	86447	86447	She	330	“ I think you should all stay here a few days . Can you do that ? It ’s almost the weekend . Courtney ’s eyes are so tired , and I ’ve got plenty of room . ”
86508	86536	86447	86447	She	330	“ I do n’t see why not . I saw my only client for the week , and Court rescheduled most of her appointments just in case . ”
86537	86540	86541	86541	Ma	140	“ Good . ”
86553	86576	86541	86541	Ma	140	“ Go upstairs , take a nice long bath , get a good night ’s sleep … And turn off your phone . ”
86596	86601	86602	86603	Ms. Alice	208	“ You found it ! ”
86618	86638	86639	86639	She	140	“ Oh , let me see it . I do n’t ’ want anything to happen to this book . ”
86660	86669	86649	86649	Ma	140	“ I have n’t seen this in years . ”
86683	86692	86670	86670	Daisy	178	“ Oh , look . You found it . ”
86704	86712	86713	86713	She	140	“ Do n’t get me in trouble . ”
86733	86749	86719	86719	Courtney	163	“ Hey , is n’t that the book we used to cast that protection spell ? ”
86761	86765	86750	86751	Ms. Alice	208	“ Protection spell ? ”
86776	86790	86766	86766	Courtney	163	“ It did n’t work . He still gave you a black eye . ”
86791	86794	86795	86795	Ma	140	“ What ? ”
86806	86816	86795	86795	Ma	140	“ Who gave you a black eye ? When ? ”
86817	86828	86829	86829	I	0	“ I ’m fine , Ma , it was nothing . ”
86837	86854	86855	86856	Ms. Alice	208	“ Anyway , the spell did work . We ’re all here , are n’t we ? ”
86861	86893	86855	86856	Ms. Alice	208	“ These women did n’t need spells . They had each other . It ’s a powerful thing when women support one another , and we ’re here to support you . ”
86894	86898	86899	86899	Courtney	163	“ Thank you . ”
86906	86931	86932	86932	Her	163	“ You all have helped me so much through this . I ca n’t tell you how much I appreciate it , and Ollie … ”
86947	86968	86940	86940	her	330	“ Is a wonderful boy and so smart ! Why the things he can tell you about frogs is amazing . ”
86981	86989	86990	86990	Courtney	163	“ Just keep her away from me . ”
86997	87007	86990	86990	Courtney	163	“ Do n’t forget Spencer . He was amazing . ”
87014	87019	87008	87008	Daisy	178	“ What about Spencer ? ”
87020	87026	87027	87027	Courtney	163	“ He was really great . ”
87042	87055	87029	87029	her	163	“ He saved me from a long trial and maybe even jail . ”
87056	87067	87068	87068	Daisy	178	“ What ? How did he do all of that ? ”
87098	87115	87091	87092	My cousin	308	“ I thought he was just looking for an excuse to spend more time with you . ”
87133	87145	87146	87146	I	0	“ Spending more time with me was not on his agenda . ”
87164	87171	87172	87172	Spencer	198	“ I would n’t say that . ”
87183	87196	87172	87172	Spencer	198	“ Good morning , ladies . I hope I ’m not interrupting . ”
87242	87251	87255	87255	herself	208	“ Sweet baby Jesus , my lady bits . ”
87268	87289	87258	87258	Ma	140	“ Spencer , I had no idea you were coming . Would you like some coffee ? Alice made scones . ”
87290	87298	87299	87300	Ms. Alice	208	“ You can have all my scones , ”
87327	87345	87313	87313	he	198	“ Thank you , Regina , I was hoping to speak to Joselyn if she ’s available . ”
87346	87355	87356	87356	Daisy	178	“ What ’s on your mind , Spence ? ”
87386	87397	87398	87398	He	198	“ I hoped you might take a walk with me ? ”
87416	87423	87413	87413	I	0	“ I do n’t mind walking . ”
87451	87458	87445	87446	Ms. Alice	208	“ Do n’t walk so fast ! ”
87562	87572	87573	87573	Spencer	198	“ I ’m not sure where we ’re going . ”
87579	87592	87573	87573	Spencer	198	“ I ’d wanted to go somewhere private so we could talk . ”
87650	87656	87657	87657	I	0	“ We can talk here . ”
87741	87749	87732	87732	I	0	“ What do you want , Spencer ? ”
87750	87764	87765	87765	He	198	“ Last night I had so many things to say , but now … ”

87835	87853	87830	87830	his	198	“ I ’m sorry I left that way . I did n’t do it to hurt you . ”
87866	87872	87854	87854	His	198	“ You did hurt me . ”
87873	87904	87906	87906	he	198	“ I realize that now . I was thinking about the past , my past , and the things I had to handle , doors I had to close before … ”
87917	87931	87932	87932	He	198	“ I was n’t thinking about you or how it must have seemed . ”
87978	88010	87975	87975	he	198	“ You want something I ’ve never done . I ca n’t promise I ’ll be any good at it . I ca n’t promise I wo n’t fuck it up . ”

88140	88167	88132	88132	he	198	“ I went to Rhode Island because I thought if I saw my dad , if I visited Drake ’s grave , I might understand why . ”

88173	88235	88237	88237	his	1765	“ Not until I came back and saw you again . Sitting alone in that empty house last night , with only my things … I hated him . When he died , I sold everything he had so I ’d never be like him , only I turned into something worse . He only hurt me . I hurt you . ”
88269	88293	88253	88253	He	1765	“ I want to change for you , Sin . I want to be the man you deserve . Is it too late ? ”
88339	88346	88320	88320	him	1765	“ It ’s not too late . ”
