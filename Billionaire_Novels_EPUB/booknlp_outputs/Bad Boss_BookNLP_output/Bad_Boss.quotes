352	600	601	601	You	223	” I scrunched up my face as I freed myself from my blazer . Yeah , no . Not so much . If lucky meant nine years of chasing nonexistent promotions , being tricked into working thousands of overtime hours without the pay , getting thrown under the bus for anything the higher - ups did wrong , and spending the past three months on a piece that my editor had no intention of crediting me for – a fun fact I ’d discovered just today – then sure , I was lucky . So lucky that I wound up permanently deleting all history of my research , contacts and writing , leaving the office in a blaze of glory that set my bosses back three months of hard work . So … bridges ? All burned . There was definitely no going back . And while it was exhilarating now , I knew that by morning , once reality set in , I ’d be horrified . I ’d worked with the company since I was eighteen . My office - centric life was all I knew . Being overworked was all I knew . In fact , I had no clue what to do with my time if I was n’t strapped to a desk , and around 8AM tomorrow , I ’d probably remember all that and have a very thorough meltdown . So for now , I was going to ride the high . "
609	617	601	601	You	223	” the cabbie called back to confirm . “
627	829	601	601	You	223	” Also known as the corner of Drink My Ass Off and Dance Till Four , I declared silently , yanking out my hair tie and shaking out my topknot . I was in a rare mood . I was feeling bold … liberated . Practically drunk off the thrill of having no responsibilities tomorrow . For the first time in my adult life , I had no one to report to , not a soul to be on call for , and I felt good about it , which was something I knew would n’t last , so … why not take advantage of tonight and do something crazy ? Well . I bit my lip . I had answers for that . A bevy of them that had to do with spur - of - the - moment decisions having deep and lasting consequences , and how I should really , really know that better than anyone else . But before I could get into that buzzkill with myself , a storm of texts pinged in my phone . Perfect timing . I reached into my pocket , knowing without looking that the messages were all from my best friend .
1542	1566	1567	1567	I	0	“ Lia , we ’re officially in the same building – ca n’t this wait till I meet you up on the roof ? ”
1621	1689	1619	1619	man	250	“ No , Sara , it can not wait , because you strung me along all night with your cryptic - ass texts and now that I finally know what the heck is going on , I ’m drunk and I ’m excited and I ’m ready to butter up some hotties for you so they ’re nice and warm by the time you get up here ! ”
1690	1702	1619	1619	man	250	“ Oh , that just sounds … so creepy , Lia . ”
1703	1707	1708	1708	She	251	“ Did it ? ”
1715	1767	1708	1708	She	251	“ I guess so . Lukas is giving me the weirdest look right now . But whatever , it ’s not your night , Lukas – I ’m talking to Lukas right now – it ’s Sara ’s night . Right , Sara ? I ’m talking to you right now . ”
1790	1798	1768	1768	I	0	“ Sure , drunkie , it is . ”
1799	1843	1850	1850	Lia	101	“ Exactly . So listen . I was talking to this guy just now who is a solid nine – do n’t look at me like that , Lukas – and he is a total sweetheart . Like , such a nice person . ”
1844	1849	1850	1850	Lia	101	“ Uh - huh . ”
1965	1972	1985	1985	Lia	101	“ ass that wo n’t quit , ”
2008	2013	2014	2014	I	0	“ Lia – listen , ”
2018	2048	2014	2014	I	0	“ I appreciate your tip , and I love you very much , but I do n’t think a cat dad sweetheart is what I ’m looking for tonight . ”
2049	2054	1985	1985	Lia	101	“ What ? Why ? ”
2055	2062	2063	2063	I	0	“ Is this a serious question ? ”
2074	2088	2063	2063	I	0	“ And do we really need to be having this conversation right now ? ”
2089	2124	2125	2125	Lia	101	“ Yes , Sara , it ’s a serious question , because I ’m drunk , and when I ’m drunk , I have comprehension issues , which makes every question a serious question , ”
2145	2189	2141	2141	she	101	“ Now explain to me why you do n’t want the nice guy I picked for you when I already told him all about you , and please tell me why you keep trying to get off the phone with me all night ! ”
2190	2193	2194	2194	I	0	“ Because , ”
2197	2359	2194	2194	I	0	“ For starters , I just spent the past however many years having a bunch of okay sex with a guy I was the bare minimum of attracted to , so tonight I specifically do n’t want that kind of sex . I want good , sweaty … kind of mean sex with a man who ’ll just pin me down and … fuck me so hard he breaks the headboard . And to answer your second question , I want to get off the phone because I do n’t want to talk about the mind - blowing sex I ’m going to have tonight , I just want to have it . Thinking about it is turning me on to the point of torture right now and being on the phone with you while I ’m this insane level of horny actually feels kind of weird , so will you please just let me get in the elevator , Li ? ”
2371	2384	2365	2365	I	0	“ Because it ’s here , I ’m in , and I – ”
2446	2449	2450	2450	I	0	“ Um . ”
2552	2555	2556	2556	He	263	“ Hi . ”
2582	2585	2571	2571	he	263	“ Hi . ”
2711	2714	2709	2709	Sara	100	“ So ... ”
2735	2739	2724	2724	he	263	“ Were you … ”
2747	2760	2761	2761	I	0	“ Were you there for the entirety of that conversation ? Downstairs ? ”
2822	2825	2826	2826	He	263	“ No . ”
2833	2849	2828	2828	his	263	“ Just long enough to hear about how hard you want to get fucked tonight . ”
2855	2858	2859	2859	I	0	“ Right , ”
2870	2910	2859	2859	I	0	“ In my defense , I just had a bit of a catastrophic day , and tomorrow ’s probably going to be worse . So I ’m giving myself basically the next ten hours to do whatever I want . ”
2911	2915	2916	2916	He	263	“ Ten hours . ”
2921	2930	2916	2916	He	263	“ That ’s not a lot of time . ”
2945	2956	2939	2939	I	0	“ That ’s okay . I ’m a simple girl . ”
2992	3009	2987	2987	It	266	“ I ’m not so sure that ’s the word I ’d use to describe you . ”
3020	3027	3015	3015	I	0	“ No ? Why is that ? ”
3028	3034	2987	2987	It	266	“ Simple implies easily explained . ”
3035	3041	3042	3042	He	263	“ Which I ’m not ? ”
3066	3081	3042	3042	He	263	“ No . I already have … more than a few questions about you . ”
3125	3131	3132	3132	I	0	“ What kind of questions ? ”
3142	3167	3168	3168	He	263	“ You do n’t have to be shy . Like I said , it ’s a fuck - it kind of night for me . ”
3171	3180	3168	3168	He	263	“ You sure about what you ’re saying ? ”
3198	3201	3189	3189	I	0	“ Yes . ”
3202	3226	3227	3227	he	263	“ Then I guess I ’m just wondering how a girl who looks like you has trouble getting someone to pin her down , ”
3231	3258	3227	3227	he	263	“ and fuck her as hard as she wants . Pretty sure any straight man would be happy to sacrifice a headboard or two for that . ”
3353	3367	3348	3348	I	0	“ What do … what do you mean someone who looks like me ? ”
3372	3384	3368	3368	I	0	“ Do n’t be coy . You know what I mean . ”
3388	3414	3385	3385	I	0	“ I want to say I do , but I feel like I need to confirm , because this all feels very surreal right now . ”
3457	3475	3476	3476	He	1814	“ Fine . I meant that you ’re not just some average cute girl . You ’re … ”
3493	3508	3484	3484	he	1814	“ Hot . Really fucking hot . The kind that makes men feel urgent . ”
3509	3513	3514	3514	He	1814	“ Urgent how ? ”
3524	3550	3514	3514	He	1814	“ Like they need to jerk or fuck the image of you out of their head . Does that paint a clear picture for you ? ”
3554	3557	3514	3514	He	1814	“ Fairly . ”
3558	3563	3564	3564	he	1814	“ Any more questions ? ”
3567	3570	3571	3571	I	0	“ Possibly , ”
3575	3578	3571	3571	I	0	“ Like ? ”
3584	3593	3579	3579	I	0	“ Would you consider yourself among those men ? ”
3599	3630	3594	3594	He	1814	“ Considering I mentally fucked you in four different positions before you so much as laid eyes on me , I ’d be inclined to say the answer is yes . ”
3642	3651	3635	3635	I	0	“ And which position did you like best ? ”
3665	3688	3660	3660	Sara	100	“ I liked the one where I had you bent over the sink so I could watch everything bounce in the mirror . ”
3696	3711	3693	3693	his	1814	“ But you straddling me to ride my cock was a very close second . ”
3794	3802	3803	3803	he	278	“ I think you missed your floor , ”
3822	3831	3803	3803	he	278	“ I guess I ’ll go to yours . ”
3955	3959	3960	3960	His	278	“ So sweet . ”
4111	4114	4115	4115	I	0	“ Enough . ”
4136	4151	4152	4152	I	0	“ Do n’t tease me . I need you inside me already – please , ”
4228	4234	4235	4235	I	0	“ Take it off first . ”
4238	4241	4235	4235	I	0	“ What ? ”
4242	4259	4260	4260	I	0	“ I want to watch you play with your tits . Then we ’ll go in . ”
4337	4343	4329	4329	his	285	“ Play with your nipples . ”
4391	4400	4401	4401	I	0	“ God , just take me inside already , ”
4486	4496	4497	4497	he	285	“ Christ . It just gets better and better , ”
4552	4555	4539	4539	he	285	“ Fuck . ”
4597	4600	4582	4582	he	285	“ More . ”
4601	4606	4607	4607	His	285	“ What was that ? ”
4612	4617	4607	4607	His	285	“ I want more . ”
4664	4669	4646	4646	he	285	“ Mmmm ... God ! ”
4695	4706	4707	4707	he	285	“ Christ , you ’re getting me so fucking hard , ”
4710	4719	4707	4707	he	285	“ Look at how fucking sexy you are . ”
4845	4850	4851	4851	I	0	“ Squeeze them hard , ”

5012	5015	5016	5016	I	0	“ Yes , ”
5068	5081	5082	5082	I	0	“ I should be wet enough that you ’ll fit easily now , ”
5088	5094	5095	5095	He	285	“ What did you say ? ”
5129	5141	5142	5142	he	285	“ And here I thought I could n’t get any harder , ”
5308	5314	5315	5315	I	0	“ What are you doing ? ”
5416	5420	5421	5421	he	285	“ Do it , ”
5434	5444	5445	5445	he	285	“ Suck on it . Fucking hell , please , ”
5448	5459	5445	5445	he	285	“ Let me feel your beautiful mouth on my cock . ”

6092	6095	6119	6119	he	108	“ Yeah ? ”
6096	6118	6119	6119	he	108	“ Yeah – listen , it ’s her twentieth birthday today and it ’s also her first time at Empire Stadium , ”
6153	6185	6186	6186	Turner	108	“ Do n’t you , uh … do n’t you think she should get a nice tour from the owner of the American League champs ? A nice , personal tour ? ”
6230	6241	6213	6213	I	0	“ You know , I did just have a thought . ”
6247	6250	6213	6213	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”

6264	6300	6255	6255	I	0	“ I was thinking we should take a trip out to the Biarritz property . You could get an in - person look at our clientele and all the improvements we ’ve made since the – ”
6301	6311	6312	6312	Turner	108	“ Ah , fuck , you ’re talking business . ”
6332	6356	6319	6319	I	0	“ Jesus , man . I got excited for a second . I thought you were about to suggest we do some blow . ”

6873	6893	6850	6850	I	0	“ Did n’t think so . Let me guess – you ’re babysitting her for one of the Roths . ”
6894	6897	6898	6898	Emmett	113	“ Bingo . ”
6916	6957	6898	6898	Emmett	113	“ I ’d say forget them at this point but fuck , do those assholes have everything you need . And all that power just fell into their laps . They do n’t even know what to do with it . ”
6958	6967	6978	6978	His	113	“ I ’d prefer you not remind me . ”
6968	6977	6978	6978	His	113	“ Alright , let ’s change the subject . ”
6984	7001	6978	6978	His	113	“ Oh , wait , there ’s no other subject with you besides work . Right ? ”
7035	7038	7028	7028	I	0	“ Except … ”
7039	7043	6978	6978	His	113	“ Do n’t . ”
7044	7061	7014	7014	him	113	“ There is a topic we still have n’t gotten the chance to clear up yet . ”
7062	7068	7028	7028	I	0	“ Drop it , Emmett . ”
7069	7103	7104	7104	I	0	“ Come on , dude . I need an explanation . Who was she ? How ’d you meet her ? I ’ve never seen you get so upset over a girl before . ”
7117	7147	7104	7104	I	0	“ I was n’t upset over a girl . I was upset that you burst into the room while I was clearly in the middle of something with her . ”
7269	7279	7267	7267	her	343	“ I can tell you ’re thinking about her . ”

7396	7432	7384	7384	I	0	“ Take it easy , brother . This just means you ’re human for once . Besides , it ’s New York . It ’s a small city . You ’ll run into her again . ”
7433	7457	7458	7458	I	0	“ It ’s the fourth largest city in the world , but I appreciate your ability to always look on the bright side . ”
7464	7473	7458	7458	I	0	“ I should get back to my suite . ”
7474	7511	7512	7512	I	0	“ Yeah , why not hurry up and wait . You ’re gon na get back there just in time to hear the Roths face - fucking twenty - year - old girls in the bathroom . ”
7515	7532	7512	7512	I	0	“ Thank you for your colorful phrasing . And for putting that image in my head . ”
7533	7572	7573	7573	I	0	“ Anytime . Now sit your ass down and watch this game with me . You own this damned team , you might as well try to care about them like you actually did when we were kids . ”

8026	8033	7990	7990	She	360	“ Yes , sir . Absolutely . ”
8034	8104	8105	8105	I	0	“ I need you to go to my suite a few doors down . Turner Roth is the blonde - haired guy around six feet tall . He ’s wearing a blue shirt and he ’s with a girl in a yellow dress named Cass . I apologize in advance for whatever you might see them doing , but when they ’re done , will you give him this ? ”
8126	8132	8122	8122	She	362	“ Of course , sir . ”
8133	8139	8164	8164	she	362	“ Thank you , Jennifer . ”
8140	8149	8150	8150	She	362	“ You ’re very welcome , Mr. Hoult . ”
8422	8427	8428	8428	she	101	“ Oh , bubs , ”
8451	8460	8428	8428	she	101	“ all dressed up and nowhere to go . ”
8461	8472	8473	8473	I	0	“ I ’m guessing dinner did n’t go so well . ”
8478	8494	8473	8473	I	0	“ It was … bad . And awkward . And a little sexist at times . ”
8495	8503	8428	8428	she	101	“ What ? What did he say ? ”
8504	8551	8473	8473	I	0	“ Lots of stuff about how I should stop freaking out about being unemployed , that it ’s okay for pretty girls to not have jobs . Then something about how women are actually a burden to companies , and maternity leave is unfair to men . ”
8552	8555	8556	8556	Lia	101	“ Wow , ”
8559	8569	8556	8556	Lia	101	“ That ’s super charming for a first date . ”
8570	8575	8576	8576	I	0	“ Is n’t it ? ”
8840	8853	8854	8854	Lia	101	“ It ’s okay , girl . Onto the next , right ? ”
8861	8891	8854	8854	Lia	101	“ I would say that , but I think Elevator Babe might ’ve ruined my taste in men forever . The bar ’s been set way too high now . ”
8892	8901	8902	8902	Lia	101	“ He was really that good - looking ? ”
8912	8962	8906	8906	I	0	“ He was literally the best - looking person I ’ve ever laid eyes on in my life . In fact , I ’m pretty sure he ’s the best - looking person anyone has ever laid eyes on in their life . In history and this entire world . ”
8963	8998	8999	8999	Lia	101	“ Excuse me . I may be biased , but I think the best - looking person in the world is my boyfriend , Lukas , but before you roll your eyes at me , ”
9010	9065	9003	9003	I	0	“ I do know of someone in Lukas ’s social circle who you ’d find attractive . In fact , I ’ve told you about him before , but you were never interested in listening and he ’s also kind of a huge dick , so I figured it might be for the best , ”
9071	9104	9105	9105	she	101	“ But anyway , if it ’s not a dating thing and all you ’re looking for is a really hot guy to finish the job that Elevator Babe started then Julian , ”
9114	9120	9105	9105	she	101	“ could be the one . ”
9121	9132	9154	9154	her	101	“ Right . I think you ’ve mentioned him before . ”
9133	9146	9154	9154	her	101	“ I definitely have . Would you be interested in meeting him ? ”
9147	9151	9152	9152	Lia	101	“ I guess . ”
9160	9264	9152	9152	Lia	101	“ Oh my God , look , I know he might not end up as hot as your mysterious Elevator God , but I promise he ’s ten billion worlds better than Tinder Josh . In fact , I can say , despite being absurdly in love with Lukas , that Julian is objectively gorgeous . Like , really , really , almost annoyingly handsome – and mega rich , if you ’re into that . But anyway , I ’m gon na Google him and prove it to you right now so I can go ahead and say I told you so . ”
9265	9268	9269	9269	I	0	“ Lia . ”
9280	9338	9339	9339	I	0	“ It ’s fine , girl , I trust you . Tell you what , the next time you text me that you 're all hanging out , I ’ll actually join . I ’ve always wanted to , but I actually have the time now . In fact , I have way too much time now , ”
9357	9371	9372	9372	Lia	101	“ Ah , ah . No wallowing , Sara . I forbid it , ”
9387	9438	9380	9380	she	101	“ Hey , look at me . Do you wanna do something fun tonight ? You wanna see if there ’s a good chick flick at Alamo Drafthouse ? We can get drunk off margaritas and laugh at how people never say ‘ bye ’ on the phone in movies . ”
9439	9445	9380	9380	she	101	“ That ’s an idea . ”
9446	9449	9450	9450	Lia	101	“ Or . ”
9465	9483	9462	9462	her	101	“ We could drink unlimited Veuve Cliquot for free at some billionaire fundraiser on the West Side . ”
9493	9501	9462	9462	her	101	“ Those are two very different options . ”
9502	9532	9533	9533	She	101	“ I know . But Lukas is at the fundraiser right now , and he says it ’s not black tie , so we can totally go . Also … ”
9563	9574	9556	9556	she	101	“ Yes ! Julian ’s there . We ’re going ! ”
9575	9579	9580	9580	I	0	“ Oh God , ”
9594	9610	9611	9611	Lia	101	“ Do n’t ‘ oh God ’ me , you ’ll be thanking me soon , ”
9628	9658	9611	9611	Lia	101	“ You and Julian , girl . It ’s happening . I mean he ’s kind of the worst , but he ’s probably at least decent in bed . ”
9659	9666	9667	9667	I	0	“ Nice . You sold him , ”
9772	9776	9777	9777	I	0	“ But why ? ”
9782	9786	9777	9777	I	0	“ Silent auction ? ”
9805	9814	9815	9815	she	101	“ There ’s Lukas talking to some people , ”
9848	9866	9843	9843	I	0	“ I do n’t see Julian anywhere near him though . I wonder where that jerk is . ”
9867	9876	9830	9830	she	101	“ Again , you ’re really selling him . ”
9877	9907	9843	9843	I	0	“ Oh , hush . I could sing nothing but praise and you still would n’t care . You ’re just so … hung up on this elevator guy . ”
10096	10101	10102	10102	Lia	101	“ Oh , oh ! ”
10105	10110	10102	10102	Lia	101	“ I see Julian ! ”
10133	10146	10130	10130	she	101	“ Which one is he ? The blonde guy in the blue ? ”
10147	10160	10173	10173	Lia	101	“ Ugh , no , that guy is blocking him right now . ”
10161	10164	10165	10165	I	0	“ Mm . ”
10177	10197	10198	10198	she	101	“ Hey ! Act like you care ! Blue Suit ’s about to move so you can see Julian , ”
10202	10220	10198	10198	she	101	“ There , there ! The one in the dark grey ! Quick , quick , look ! ”
10221	10226	10227	10227	I	0	“ Okay , okay ! ”
10425	10429	10430	10430	he	109	“ That motherfucker ! ”
10450	10454	10430	10430	he	109	“ only real talent ”
10478	10481	10482	10482	Turner	108	“ Hey . ”
10486	10505	10482	10482	Turner	108	“ Let ’s go over there and outbid him in front of her . It ’ll be epic . ”
10512	10515	10506	10506	I	0	“ No . ”
10516	10534	10535	10535	I	0	“ Oh , right , you ’re not impressed . You ’ve got plenty of those babies . ”
10609	10643	10644	10644	Turner	108	“ Hey – why do n’t we take one of your rides for a spin ? Maybe cruise around town and find some real talent since there ’s clearly none in this room , ”
10654	10657	10658	10658	he	108	“ Boring , ”
10661	10664	10658	10658	he	108	“ Turner . ”
10670	10701	10702	10702	I	0	“ I should remind you that I ’m trying to sell the Biarritz resort as soon as possible and you ’re by no means the only person interested in buying , ”
10861	10883	10884	10884	He	108	“ Hey . Anyone ever tell you to just relax , Hoult ? We ’re at a party . Enjoy yourself . ”
10890	10897	10884	10884	He	108	“ Tell you what , man . ”
10922	10973	10974	10974	He	108	“ Why do n’t we see what ’s going on at 1OAK tonight ? We ’ll grab Carter , take a spin in one of your cars , and we ’ll have a grand finale of balls to the wall partying before buckling down on Monday and really getting to – ”
10978	10981	10974	10974	He	108	“ Fuck . ”
10999	11002	11003	11003	I	0	“ What ? ”
11008	11016	11017	11017	he	108	“ Who ’s that fuckin ’ beauty ? ”
11121	11129	11117	11117	I	0	“ The hell is she doing here ? ”
11158	11169	11170	11170	She	415	“ What ? You know her ? Who is she ? ”
11207	11225	11226	11226	I	0	“ Jesus , Hoult . Hello ? Do n’t keep me hanging . I ’m dying here . ”
11262	11268	11269	11269	I	0	“ She ’s my assistant , ”
11302	11319	11320	11320	Turner	108	“ Your assistant ? Why have n’t you brought her around ? Are you fucking crazy ? ”
11386	11389	11390	11390	I	0	“ What ? ”
11395	11422	11423	11423	I	0	“ Jesus – I asked why you ’ve never brought her around before . If she ’s your assistant , where the hell has she been ? ”
11429	11438	11439	11439	I	0	“ She was away the past few weeks , ”
11454	11485	11439	11439	I	0	“ She was overseeing the renovation and management change at the Biarritz resort . Her flight just got in tonight , so I was n’t expecting to see her here . ”
11504	11508	11509	11509	he	108	“ No shit , ”
11520	11528	11509	11509	he	108	“ Poor girl just wants to party . ”
11652	11661	11662	11662	he	108	“ Hoult , I owe you an apology , ”
11669	11694	11662	11662	he	108	“ I thought you were too straight - laced to hire smoking hot girls like her . Fuck did my dad call them again ? ”
11705	11710	11697	11697	his	108	“ Office - wreckers . ”
11711	11728	11737	11737	his	108	“ I hire based on capability , and I have a strict rule against interoffice dating . ”
11729	11734	11735	11735	Turner	108	“ You ’re crazy . ”
11740	11756	11737	11737	his	108	“ I mean Christ , do you see those tits ? Look at those tits . ”
11766	11791	11792	11792	I	0	“ I have eyes . I know she ’s attractive . She ’s just far too valuable of an employee to risk anything with , ”
11795	11800	11801	11801	he	108	“ Uh - huh , ”
11805	11831	11801	11801	he	108	“ So you , uh … you said she ’s your expert on the Biarritz resort ? What ’s the name of the place again ? ”
11832	11836	11837	11837	My	0	“ Hotel Piera . ”
11851	11882	11842	11842	I	0	“ If you ’re interested in hearing her reports , I ’d be happy to have you at the office on Tuesday . That ’s her first official day back . ”
11883	11886	11887	11887	Turner	108	“ Yeah ? ”
11893	11909	11887	11887	Turner	108	“ Set it up , Hoult . Tuesday ’s good . Noon work for you ? ”
11910	11915	11916	11916	I	0	“ Noon ’s perfect , ”
12029	12040	12044	12044	his	108	“ Do n’t look surprised . Just come with me . ”
12096	12102	12103	12103	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
12148	12151	12152	12152	I	0	“ Hey . ”
12202	12214	12215	12215	His	110	“ Hey . Can you please tell me what ’s happening ? ”
12222	12232	12233	12233	he	110	“ My colleague downstairs has his eye on you , ”
12276	12297	12270	12270	I	0	“ And I need to brief you on a lie I involved you in before he tries to introduce himself . ”
12298	12309	12310	12310	He	110	“ What the hell are you talking about , Julian ? ”
12349	12408	12341	12341	he	110	“ You have Turner Roth ’s attention . I want his . For that reason , I ’d like to hire you for a very short and specific job . To be safe , we can make it a three - month contract , and I ’ll pay however much your last employer offered for a full year . ”
12409	12412	12310	12310	He	110	“ What ? ”
12417	12432	12310	12310	He	110	“ Wait . I do n’t understand – what kind of job is this ? ”
12433	12483	12484	12484	He	434	“ You ’d be posing as my assistant , and by Tuesday , I ’d need you to have memorized a full report on a twenty - million - dollar renovation to a resort in Biarritz , France that I ’m looking to sell to Turner and Carter Roth . ”
12493	12512	12484	12484	He	434	“ I ’ll also be needing you to present this information to them in a rather specific way . ”
12513	12518	12484	12484	He	434	“ How is that ? ”
12519	12526	12527	12527	I	0	“ I need you seduce them . ”
12530	12534	12484	12484	He	434	“ Excuse me ? ”
12535	12549	12484	12484	He	434	“ By seduce , I do n’t at all mean sleep with them . ”
12550	12573	12574	12574	I	0	“ Thank God for that , but then what do you mean ? Because I think I need a very thorough explanation , ”
12595	12612	12613	12613	he	434	“ I have a limited amount of time to strike an important deal with the Roths , ”
12626	12775	12613	12613	he	434	“ They just inherited the biggest sports and entertainment presenter in America , despite the fact that they ’re by no means actual or savvy businessmen . In fact , their particular egos make it so that they feel little reason to pay attention to anything unless it involves instant gratification , generally in the form of impressing a beautiful woman . Of course , from what I ’ve gathered , they lose that interest the moment they actually have sex with the woman , so your job is to be professional while also dressing provocatively and flirting enough to maintain their interest . All I need is for them to listen long enough to connect me with their business advisors , with whom I ’ll actually have productive meetings . So realistically , the hardest part of your job could be done within just a few meetings . ”
12812	12854	12807	12807	I	0	“ Okay , so … correct me if I ’m wrong , but you ’re saying you want me to string these guys along with my sexual allure , and force them to pay attention to your pitch in the process ? ”
12855	12924	12928	12928	I	0	“ Yes . But you ’ll never spend any time alone with them . You ’ll only ever be accompanying me during meetings and business trips , and when we ’re not doing anything involving the Roths , which will probably be most days of your week , you ’re free to use the resources at my office to send resumes , or work on your own projects . ”
12946	12952	12953	12953	Julian	107	“ What are you thinking ? ”
12956	12962	12963	12963	I	0	“ That this is crazy , ”
13052	13061	13062	13062	Julian	107	“ Tell me about the job you quit , ”
13072	13077	13062	13062	Julian	107	“ Where was it ? ”
13078	13082	13083	13083	He	107	“ June Magazine . ”
13086	13091	13083	13083	He	107	“ You ’re kidding . ”
13098	13105	13092	13092	I	0	“ I ’m not . Why ? ”
13106	13110	13111	13111	he	107	“ No reason , ”
13124	13158	13111	13111	he	107	“ But if I told you that I could guarantee getting you either your job back or a better one after our contract is finished , would you agree to work for me ? ”
13343	13346	13347	13347	I	0	“ Okay , ”
13384	13390	13377	13377	he	107	“ We have a deal ? ”
13420	13423	13424	13424	I	0	“ Yes . ”
13433	13439	13424	13424	I	0	“ We have a deal . ”
13448	13463	13424	13424	I	0	“ And in case you were at all interested , my name is Sara . ”
13469	13472	13473	13473	Julian	107	“ Sara , ”
13501	13513	13514	13514	he	107	“ It was nice to meet you last week , Sara , ”
13524	13533	13514	13514	he	107	“ I look forward to working with you . ”
13534	13537	13538	13538	I	0	“ Likewise , ”
13818	13829	13830	13830	Lia	101	“ I maintain that I told you about him before , ”
13879	13882	13883	13883	I	0	“ Disagree . ”
13935	13948	13923	13923	Pringles	126	“ I swear , you did n’t tell me shit , woman . ”
13949	13953	13958	13958	herself	101	“ Oh no , ”
13960	13969	13958	13958	herself	101	“ Did I just chip my favorite mug ? ”
13981	14016	13975	13975	she	101	“ Oh , thank God , I did n’t . You know what I did do though ? Tell you about Julian . A long time ago . On three or four separate occasions . ”
14035	14066	14067	14067	I	0	“ Well , if you did , you did n’t harass me hard enough to listen . Or offer the juicy details , like how he owns Hoult Freaking Publishing , ”
14136	14152	14121	14121	I	0	“ Whatever . Stop Googling pictures of him . I can hear you furiously clicking . ”
14153	14159	14160	14160	I	0	“ Hoult Publishing , Lia , ”
14163	14172	14160	14160	I	0	“ I ’ll never forgive you for this . ”
14173	14178	14181	14181	her	452	“ Yeah , yeah . ”
14192	14233	14181	14181	her	452	“ To be fair , I have no idea what Hoult Publishing is . When I first met Julian , everyone was talking about how he just bought a baseball team , so I thought that was what he did . ”
14234	14258	14160	14160	I	0	“ Yeah , that ’s also fucking crazy . The fact that he owns the Empires ? They ’re killing it this season . ”
14259	14278	14160	14160	I	0	“ Whatever . Is baseball brown ball or white ball ? And are you leaving for work yet ? ”
14279	14290	14181	14181	her	452	“ Almost . I just need to finish getting dressed . ”
14291	14306	14307	14307	Lia	101	“ Is n’t the point of your dirty little job to not be dressed ? ”
14310	14350	14351	14351	Lia	101	“ Only on days that I ’m meeting with the Perv Brothers , and even then , I do have to keep it tasteful . I ca n’t just waltz into the conference room wearing a thong and fishnets . ”
14354	14367	14351	14351	Lia	101	“ Of course not . You ’d need sequined nipple tassels too . ”
14368	14399	14400	14400	I	0	“ I would never wear sequins to work , Lia . You know I would keep it classy – pinstriped nipple tassels , only . Maybe khaki ones on Fridays , ”
14410	14434	14435	14435	I	0	“ In all seriousness though , I do need to maintain some air of professionalism … which probably also requires being on time , ”
14479	14487	14474	14474	Lia	101	“ Time check is eight - fifteen . ”
14488	14493	14494	14494	My	0	“ Shit , really ? ”
14511	14527	14501	14501	I	0	“ God , I refuse to be late . On the first day or any . ”
14528	14554	14555	14555	Lia	101	“ Breathe , girl . You wo n’t be late if you leave right now . Just check for panty lines on the way out , ”
14569	14573	14555	14555	Lia	101	“ All good . ”
14574	14578	14555	14555	Lia	101	“ Buttons straight ? ”
14605	14614	14615	14615	I	0	“ Oh God . This bra is killer , ”
14639	14647	14615	14615	I	0	“ Tell me you wore The One . ”
14648	14652	14615	14615	I	0	“ I did . ”
14704	14751	14835	14835	she	101	“ He ’s gon na get one look of the girls in that thing and go nuts . I hope you ’re prepared for some hot , sweaty , bent - over - the - desk office sex . You realize that ’s happening , right ? ”
14752	14767	14768	14768	I	0	“ As much as I would n’t mind it , I ’m not sure , ”
14784	14793	14794	14794	Lia	101	“ What ? Why are n’t you sure ? ”
14798	14834	14835	14835	she	101	“ That man is definitely dying to get a moment alone with you already . First it was that barge - in at the hotel , then it was hiding you from that guy yesterday , ”
14870	14883	14835	14835	she	101	“ Trust me , girl . That man is waiting to pounce . ”
14884	14974	14835	14835	she	101	“ We ’ll see . Judging from yesterday , Julian Hoult is a very different beast when he ’s in work mode . He ’s in a different world completely . He ’s intense , and he ’s focused , and actually , it ’s insanely fucking hot and I ’m really not sure how I ’m going to handle it . But anyway , I ’m almost at the train so I ’m gon na lose service . I ’ll call you at the end of the day . ”
14975	15001	14835	14835	she	101	“ No , you ’ll text me live updates as your day goes on , except for when you ’re actively having sex with Julian . ”
15002	15012	14835	14835	she	101	“ Ha . I ’ll talk to you later . ”
15013	15018	15019	15019	Lia	101	“ Later , girl , ”
15022	15033	15019	15019	Lia	101	“ Enjoy your first day as a professional sex kitten . ”
15251	15256	15257	15257	he	1825	“ Who ’s that ? ”
15508	15515	15516	15516	I	0	“ Good morning , Mr. Hoult . ”
15597	15603	15582	15582	They	219	“ Good morning , sir . ”
15604	15610	15611	15611	He	107	“ Morning , Mr. Hoult . ”
15651	15655	15656	15656	I	0	“ Mr. Hoult , ”
15659	15663	15656	15656	I	0	“ Ms. Hanna . ”
15708	15715	15716	15716	he	107	“ How are you this morning ? ”
15720	15727	15728	15728	I	0	“ Very well , thank you , ”
15773	15787	15788	15788	I	0	“ I did start a little nervous , but I ’m better now , ”
15857	15862	15854	15854	I	0	“ How are you ? ”
15869	15878	15863	15863	His	107	“ Better now as well . Thank you . ”
15978	15982	15983	15983	he	107	“ Get ready , ”
16078	16082	16074	16074	I	0	“ Ms. Hanna . ”
16100	16106	16107	16107	he	107	“ Little forward of you , ”
16113	16116	16107	16107	he	107	“ Sorry , ”
16131	16146	16117	16117	I	0	“ Do n’t be sorry , just do n’t make that face right now . ”
16147	16151	16121	16121	him	107	“ What face ? ”
16152	16167	16168	16168	My	0	“ The one you made right before you put my cock in your mouth . ”
16198	16206	16207	16207	Julian	107	“ Now you ’re just teasing me , ”
16238	16243	16244	16244	I	0	“ Risky of you , ”
16248	16260	16261	16261	Julian	107	“ You bring it out of me , but I agree , ”
16264	16269	16261	16261	Julian	107	“ Let ’s behave . ”
16429	16439	16426	16426	he	107	“ I should fuck you right in this elevator . ”
16465	16470	16457	16457	he	107	“ You ca n’t . ”
16471	16475	16443	16443	his	107	“ Why not ? ”
16476	16484	16485	16485	I	0	“ We do n’t have enough time , ”
16495	16510	16511	16511	he	107	“ Is the lack of time your only qualm about getting fucked in here ? ”
16534	16537	16538	16538	I	0	“ Yes , ”
16542	16549	16538	16538	I	0	“ That ’s the only reason . ”
16566	16577	16578	16578	he	107	“ Then let ’s do what we have time for , ”
16612	16615	16616	16616	I	0	“ Julian ! ”
16631	16636	16616	16616	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
16736	16739	16740	16740	he	107	“ Ready ? ”
16938	16993	16994	16994	Colin	130	“ She ’s pretty much memorized on general information – facts about the building , architecture , Basque Country itself . She ’s going to take information home to keep studying , but the past hour , she ’s been looking at the quarterlies . Just so she can start getting acquainted with sales , ”
17068	17076	17060	17060	she	100	“ So she ’s right on schedule . ”
17077	17097	17148	17148	she	100	“ Ahead , if anything . Like you said , the Roths are unlikely to ask about numbers tomorrow . ”
17098	17124	17151	17151	Eager	131	“ Yes , and she knows the short - term goal here is to get the Roths to agree on a trip out to Biarritz ? ”
17125	17128	17129	17129	Colin	130	“ Yes , ”
17132	17146	17129	17129	Colin	130	“ She ’s confident she can influence them . She ’s very eager . ”
17245	17249	17238	17238	Lukas	102	“ similar workaholic tendencies ”
17507	17521	17522	17522	Colin	130	“ So if we ’re all set , I can send her home ? ”
17543	17557	17532	17532	I	0	“ Yes . But have her stop in here on her way out . ”
17558	17563	17532	17532	I	0	“ You got it . ”
17564	17568	17569	17569	I	0	“ Thank you , ”
17680	17688	17689	17689	I	0	“ Come in . Have a seat . ”
17699	17706	17689	17689	I	0	“ How was your first day ? ”
17707	17714	17715	17715	Sara	100	“ Good . I enjoyed myself , ”
17752	17774	17744	17744	I	0	“ Colin said you did a great job . Do you feel comfortable with the material you went over with him ? ”
17775	17782	17783	17783	She	100	“ Absolutely . That resort is … ”
17789	17814	17783	17783	She	100	“ So beautiful , Julian . I can hardly believe you want to sell it when you had it built from the ground up . ”
17874	17883	17865	17865	I	0	“ Do you have any questions thus far ? ”
17884	17895	17906	17906	her	100	“ About the resort ? Or my day in general ? ”
17896	17899	17900	17900	She	100	“ Either . ”
17919	17973	17906	17906	her	100	“ Well , I was wondering … obviously , Colin knows a few details about my contract since he ’s been training me on the resort information . But what does the rest of your office know about my role in this company ? Do they know … what I was hired for ? ”
17974	18014	17906	17906	her	100	“ Absolutely not . As far as the office is concerned , you ’re training to be a third assistant . They wo n’t at any point learn about the specifics of your contract . It ’s sensitive information . ”
18015	18021	18022	18022	she	100	“ Okay , thank God , ”
18025	18062	18022	18022	she	100	“ I just would n’t want my role here to be misconstrued , considering how it ’s kind of … risqué in nature . I obviously trust you with the information , but not anyone else . ”
18063	18098	17906	17906	her	100	“ Understood entirely . No one in this office or building will know about your contract . I have no intention of putting you in a position where you could be viewed differently here . ”
18099	18104	18105	18105	Sara	100	“ I appreciate it , ”
18118	18135	18115	18115	her	100	“ I take it then that what happens in the elevator before work is an exception . ”
18136	18149	17906	17906	her	100	“ Actually , I called you in here to touch upon that . ”
18150	18153	18154	18154	She	100	“ Oh ? ”
18159	18169	18154	18154	She	100	“ What exactly would you like to touch upon ? ”
18212	18265	18266	18266	I	0	“ I wanted to talk to you about a rule I ’ve enforced at this company for as long as it ’s been around . It applies to everyone , myself included , and it ’s been crucial for us in terms of running business in a seamless , strictly professional way , ”
18316	18380	18309	18309	I	0	“ In short , I have a zero tolerance rule on interoffice dating . Romances , sexual relations of any kind – they ’re all off the table , and I felt the need to tell you that despite your unique contract , and despite what happened between us before work this morning , I ca n’t allow any exceptions to that rule . ”
18387	18398	18399	18399	she	100	“ So , what happened this morning did n’t count ? ”
18403	18415	18399	18399	she	100	“ Simply because I had n’t officially started the job yet ? ”
18416	18478	18479	18479	I	0	“ I did n’t come in this morning with the intention of taking advantage of some loophole . I had n’t actually thought about it . My intention was to be professional with you from the start . Of course , I did n’t exactly control myself as I should have this morning , and I take full responsibility for that , ”
18482	18506	18479	18479	I	0	“ But moving forward , I hope we can start anew and give your contract with this company the full respect it deserves . ”
18541	18544	18536	18536	Sara	100	“ Okay . ”
18562	18568	18569	18569	I	0	“ I appreciate your understanding , ”
18597	18620	18621	18621	she	100	“ Of course . You might not know this , but if anyone were to understand work rules , it ’s me , ”
18624	18640	18641	18641	I	0	“ Then that ’s a relief to hear . And thank you again for understanding , ”
18653	18659	18641	18641	I	0	“ I do appreciate it . ”
18660	18672	18673	18673	she	100	“ Well , I appreciate the opportunity just to work here , ”
18677	18712	18673	18673	she	100	“ It ’s crazy how much I ’ve picked up from your staff in one day . I ’m pretty sure I ’ll learn quite a few things in just a few months here . ”
18713	18720	18721	18721	Her	100	“ I hope that you do . ”
18729	18743	18726	18726	she	100	“ Is that all you wanted to discuss with me , Mr. Hoult ? ”
18762	18765	18766	18766	I	0	“ Yes , ”
18769	18783	18766	18766	I	0	“ That ’s all . You ’re free to leave for the day . ”
18784	18793	18794	18794	she	100	“ Great . Thank you again for everything , ”
18801	18814	18794	18794	she	100	“ And have a good night . I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
18815	18819	18820	18820	I	0	“ You too , ”
18894	18910	18911	18911	Lia	101	“ I ’m so sorry , Sara . I feel like it ’s my fault , ”
19133	19135	19130	19130	I	0	“ yes ”
19168	19190	19162	19162	I	0	“ It ’s my fault , Lia , trust me . You did n’t tell me to take this job offer . ”
19191	19205	19373	19373	he	533	“ Yeah , but I did try to set you up with Julian . ”
19206	19242	19130	19130	I	0	“ And it might ’ve worked if I did n’t decide to become his subordinate . Now he ’s probably already ceased all sexual attraction for me like the work - addicted robot he is . ”
19243	19268	19162	19162	I	0	“ Psh , right . Lukas said he ’s never seen Julian look at a girl with the intensity that he looked at you . ”
19269	19282	19283	19283	I	0	“ Yeah , because I ’m an element of his job now , ”
19286	19329	19283	19283	I	0	“ He salivates over me because he ca n’t wait to utilize me for the purposes of this stupid contract with the Perv Bros. I ’m as good as a stapler to him now . Or an extra - sturdy paper clip . ”
19330	19368	19373	19373	he	533	“ Oh , shut it . You know that despite that stupid rule of his , he definitely still has sexual thoughts about you . I mean he admitted as much in the elevator yesterday , right ? ”
19495	19500	19477	19477	he	110	“ Earth to Sara . ”
19537	19548	19530	19530	I	0	“ Thanks . I needed to snap out of that . ”
19549	19568	19520	19520	she	101	“ Yeah , that was uncomfortable for me . You looked like you were seconds from the big O. ”
19569	19630	19535	19535	her	101	“ Shut up . And cut me some slack . I ’m dealing with an absurdly hot boss who ’s done everything but fuck me , and now that we work in the same office , I get nothing . I also have no idea how to un - turn myself on when I so much as think of him . ”
19631	19643	19644	19644	Lia	101	“ Let me help . Your mom ’s calling . Again . ”
19661	19705	19650	19650	I	0	“ I ca n’t right now . I suck at lying to her and I ’m pretty sure she ’s calling because she has a sixth sense when it comes to me . She definitely knows I did a bad thing this week . ”
19706	19711	19712	19712	Lia	101	“ A bad thing ? ”
19715	19736	19712	19712	Lia	101	“ Which of your many bad things are you referring to ? You ’re like a different person this week . ”
19737	19767	19650	19650	I	0	“ Hey , do n’t you talk to me about abrupt transformations – you went from celibate for three years to having sex with Lukas in a public bathroom . ”
19768	19771	19772	19772	Lia	101	“ Sara ! ”
19788	19809	19810	19810	she	101	“ Oh God . You need to get out of here or I ’m never going to finish this batch , ”
19813	19829	19810	19810	she	101	“ And do n’t you have your super important meeting with the Perv Bros today ? ”
19830	19856	19865	19865	Lia	101	“ Yes . But I can be a little late . I have to pick up lunch for the meeting from some restaurant in SoHo . ”
19857	19864	19865	19865	Lia	101	“ And you ’re wearing that ? ”
19873	19876	19877	19877	I	0	“ Totally , ”
19935	19945	19959	19959	Lia	101	“ I brought a change of clothes , obviously . ”
19946	19958	19959	19959	Lia	101	“ Okay , phew . Then get your cute butt going , ”
19968	20003	19959	19959	Lia	101	“ And girl , you better kill it ‘ cause I ’m pissed at Julian on your behalf and I want you to torture him with how hard you bring it for this meeting . ”
20004	20026	19959	19959	Lia	101	“ Trust me , I ’m well prepared , and I have every intention of making it hurt for him today . ”
20027	20039	20040	20040	Lia	101	“ Atta girl . Is that what that thing is about ? ”
20055	20060	20061	20061	I	0	“ Mm - hm , ”
20105	20109	20052	20052	her	101	“ I could never ”
20437	20441	20419	20419	they	114	“ the assistant . ”
20442	20451	20452	20452	Turner	108	“ Sara . She looks like a Sara , ”
20460	20468	20469	20469	Carter	109	“ What does a Sara look like ? ”
20472	20481	20469	20469	Carter	109	“ Brunette . Long legs . Great tits . ”
20482	20485	20486	20486	I	0	“ Gentlemen . ”
20552	20560	20561	20561	Turner	108	“ Jesus Christ . She seems fun , ”
20573	20589	20561	20561	Turner	108	“ My question is who thought it was a good idea to knock her up ? ”
20590	20600	20601	20601	Carter	109	“ I want to buy that guy a beer , ”
20604	20616	20617	20617	Turner	108	“ Fuck a beer . Double Scotch is what he needs , ”
20620	20643	20617	20617	Turner	108	“ See , that ’s the thing about hiring women . You got ta hire them pretty to make it worth it . ”
20655	20665	20644	20644	I	0	“ Do n’t talk about my employees like that . ”
20666	20679	20680	20680	Turner	108	“ Oh … Je - sus . Mr. No Fun right here , ”
20898	20900	20858	20858	her	100	“ Delivered ”
20991	20997	20998	20998	she	100	“ Thank you so much ! ”
21010	21034	21035	21035	he	108	“ You ’re very welcome . Sara , right ? I ca n’t believe Julian ’s got you carrying heavy bags like this , ”
21049	21059	21060	21060	she	100	“ Oh , he knows I can take it , ”
21155	21164	21165	21165	I	0	“ Gentlemen , why do n’t we sit ? ”
21295	21298	21299	21299	Sara	100	“ So , ”
21303	21352	21353	21353	she	100	“ I ’m excited to finally meet you gentlemen . Julian told me while I was out in Biarritz that there were a lot of people interested in the property and it made me so happy . And , well , a little sad at the same time , ”
21364	21373	21360	21360	Turner	108	“ Happy and sad ? Why ’s that ? ”
21374	21379	21380	21380	Sara	100	“ Oh , well , ”
21389	21438	21385	21385	she	100	“ I think Julian hates when I say this , but that resort is to die for . It ’s so elegant , so beautifully designed . Every detail is deliberately thought out to ensure the most relaxing time ever – I barely felt like I was working . ”
21439	21442	21443	21443	Turner	108	“ Wow , ”
21483	21489	21490	21490	Turner	108	“ That true , Hoult ? ”
21503	21545	21493	21493	his	108	“ I do hate when she says that . It ’s not like I wo n’t miss the place once it ’s gone . I ’m just moving away from hospitality , and the resort does n’t suit my direction anymore . ”
21546	21558	21559	21559	Sara	100	“ But it more than suits yours , right , gentlemen ? ”
21568	21587	21566	21566	Turner	108	“ I understand you guys were pro surfers – which , by the way , is really amazing . ”
21592	21603	21588	21588	Turner	108	“ I was pro . Carter was semi - pro . ”
21604	21609	21610	21610	Carter	109	“ I was pro , ”
21613	21620	21610	21610	Carter	109	“ You were both pro then , ”
21630	21644	21645	21645	She	100	“ And I understand you ’re in the market for the resort because … ”
21695	21709	21710	21710	Sara	100	“ You ’re looking to bring a … luxury surfing competition to Biarritz ? ”
21718	21721	21722	21722	She	100	“ Wow . ”
21727	21733	21722	21722	She	100	“ That ’s so interesting . ”
21825	21827	21806	21806	she	100	“ wow ”
21829	21831	21833	21833	he	108	“ absolutely ”
21860	21887	21888	21888	Sara	100	“ And Carter – I ’m so lost . Could you help me with the logistics of bringing a brand new surfing event to this town ? ”
21898	21906	21888	21888	Sara	100	“ How long would that even take ? ”
21959	21962	21963	21963	Sara	100	“ Wow , ”
21970	21983	21963	21963	Sara	100	“ So you ’ll be needing this property sooner than I thought . ”
22021	22035	22036	22036	he	0	“ Damn , I guess so . We got ta get shit moving , ”
22110	22125	22126	22126	she	100	“ You guys can teach me how to surf like I ’ve always wanted , ”
22129	22152	22126	22126	she	100	“ And , of course , we can have you check out the property firsthand so you can really gauge your interest . ”
22153	22174	22095	22095	she	100	“ Oh , I ’ll teach you to surf . I ’ll have you rippin ’ waves like The Duke . ”
22175	22201	22202	22202	Sara	100	“ I have no idea who that is , but I look forward to getting a full - on surf education from you , Turner , ”
22205	22221	22227	22227	she	100	“ You will , you will . We ’ll have to set a date soon . ”
22544	22553	22554	22554	I	0	“ Gentlemen . We ’ll touch base soon , ”
22577	22610	22611	22611	Turner	108	“ Yeah , yeah , well , why do n’t we shoot for sometime next week ? I ’m booked through the weekend , but how about we link up again Monday ? ”
22634	22639	22640	22640	I	0	“ Monday it is , ”
22674	22684	22685	22685	she	100	“ You did n’t think I could do it , ”
22704	22708	22699	22699	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
22709	22725	22726	22726	she	100	“ You texted me before the meeting started . ‘ Possible change of plans ? ’ ”
22757	22798	22746	22746	I	0	“ I was n’t doubting your ability so much as trying to give you an out . The Roths were being particularly intolerable before you arrived , and it gave me certain ideas of how they ’d behave around you . ”
22799	22805	22806	22806	I	0	“ Certain ideas ? Like ? ”
22816	22837	22806	22806	I	0	“ Like using certain language and putting their hands all over you in ways I did n’t care to see . ”
22838	22852	22858	22858	sir	1866	“ I thought you ’d hired me for that specific reason , sir . ”
22860	22872	22873	22873	I	0	“ I did . Today , I entertained second - thoughts , ”
22877	22889	22873	22873	I	0	“ I did n’t pin you for someone who had those , ”
22905	22920	22890	22890	Sara	100	“ Well , I imagine there ’s a first time for everything , Sara . ”
22921	22944	22945	22945	she	100	“ Fine . But if it happened because you feel in some way protective or doubtful of me , you can relax , ”
22969	23018	22945	22945	she	100	“ As far as I can tell , you have full confidence in Colin and Tori and every other employee of yours in this office . So if I ’m just another one of them , sir , you can feel free to let me do my job . ”
23019	23029	23034	23034	she	100	“ There ’s a unique nature to your contract , ”
23059	23108	23109	23109	she	100	“ Yes , there ’s a unique nature to my contract , but if all the same rules apply to me , then what I simply ask is that you respect me in the same way you do everyone else . Anything short of that is completely hypocritical , ”
23130	23144	23123	23123	she	100	“ Anyway , may I go on my lunch break now , sir ? ”
23145	23152	23153	23153	I	0	“ Why are you doing that ? ”
23161	23165	23156	23156	She	100	“ Doing what ? ”
23166	23181	23158	23158	her	100	“ The way you ’re calling me ‘ sir . ’ It ’s odd . ”
23182	23198	23209	23209	she	100	“ I ’m just trying to be as professional as you want me to be . ”
23218	23231	23209	23209	she	100	“ I believe the term you ’re looking for is passive aggressive . ”
23235	23244	23209	23209	she	100	“ What would you prefer I call you ? ”
23245	23248	23209	23209	she	100	“ Julian . ”
23249	23266	23267	23267	she	100	“ Alright , Julian . Is it alright if I go on my lunch break now ? ”
23309	23316	23303	23303	I	0	“ You may go to lunch . ”
23317	23323	23303	23303	I	0	“ Thank you , Julian . ”
23324	23331	23332	23332	I	0	“ You ’re welcome , Sara , ”
23639	23641	23679	23679	his	110	“ morning ”
23793	23805	23806	23806	she	101	“ I do n’t think you ’re bringing it hard enough , ”
23826	23841	23806	23806	she	101	“ This could be a double date right now , but it ’s not . ”
24050	24055	24056	24056	I	0	“ Sorry , love . ”
24065	24077	24056	24056	I	0	“ Pretty sure the boss and I are at a standstill . ”
24078	24089	24090	24090	Lia	101	“ I should have known you two were too similar , ”
24095	24123	24092	24092	her	101	“ You and Julian having sex would probably be nonstop rolling over to fight for the top . You would need wrestling mats and an entire gym . ”
24130	24142	24092	24092	her	101	“ Please keep in mind the man works in this building . ”
24143	24154	24056	24056	I	0	“ He owns the building . What do I care ? ”
24155	24171	24056	24056	I	0	“ Yeah , also , please do n’t remind me that he owns the building . ”
24172	24176	24177	24177	Lia	101	“ Why not ? ”
24187	24195	24177	24177	Lia	101	“ Because his power turns you on ? ”
24196	24224	24056	24056	I	0	“ Yes , very much so , actually . And right now , I ’m trying to manage my arousal for the sake of maintaining utmost professionalism . ”
24225	24237	24056	24056	I	0	“ Right . How ’s that going , by the way ? ”
24238	24245	24177	24177	Lia	101	“ Swimmingly . Hence the standstill . ”
24246	24264	24056	24056	I	0	“ So you ’ve officially mastered the casual - despite - my - wet - panties look ? ”
24265	24276	24277	24277	Lia	101	“ You ’ll be proud to know that I have . ”
24287	24307	24277	24277	Lia	101	“ Well , that ’s good because here comes my boyfriend and your boss looking like an Armani billboard . ”
24364	24369	24370	24370	Lia	101	“ Hey , Julian , ”
24401	24404	24406	24406	her	101	“ Hello . ”
24414	24417	24408	24408	his	110	“ Sara . ”
24418	24422	24445	24445	Julian	110	“ Mr. Hoult . ”
24423	24428	24429	24429	Lia	101	“ Oh , God , ”
24432	24442	24443	24443	she	101	“ Do you really make her call you that ? ”
24467	24474	24475	24475	He	110	“ I do n’t , actually . ”
24482	24492	24475	24475	He	110	“ I remember telling you as much , Sara . ”
24493	24502	24477	24477	his	110	“ My apologies . I must have forgotten . ”
24503	24511	24512	24512	Lia	101	“ Oh no . Couple ’s quarrel ? ”
24521	24524	24515	24515	I	0	“ What ? ”
24529	24547	24525	24525	She	101	“ I can tell you guys what Lukas and I do to fix things after we fight . ”
24548	24551	24552	24552	I	0	“ Lia , ”
24574	24600	24552	24552	I	0	“ Seriously . You all know I ignored this advice for too long myself , but sometimes you just got ta bang it out and – ”
24601	24608	24609	24609	I	0	“ I ’m getting a coffee , ”
24731	24741	24727	24727	Julian	110	“ I should have considered Lia before hiring you . ”
24771	24776	24761	24761	his	110	“ What about her ? ”
24777	24788	24789	24789	Julian	110	“ She ’s here enough as it is for Lukas , ”
24807	24831	24805	24805	himself	110	“ But aside from that , I ’d prefer you two refrain from discussing whatever it was that you clearly were just now . ”
24842	24875	24832	24832	I	0	“ I would think this was obvious , but forbidding certain topics of conversation with my friends is way outside the realm of what you ’re allowed to do as my boss . ”
24876	24883	24884	24884	he	110	“ I ’m aware of that , ”
24888	24944	24884	24884	he	110	“ What I ’m asking is for you to not discuss anything sexual that happened between us while you ’re on work premises . I ’m sure you ’ve noticed , but this large building is a rather small community . People talk , and I have no interest in giving them anything to discuss . ”
24945	24956	24957	24957	I	0	“ Fair enough . I apologize on Lia ’s behalf , ”
24961	24969	24957	24957	I	0	“ She ’s not usually like this . ”
24970	24986	24884	24884	he	110	“ I know her as well , Sara , and she ’s always like this . ”
24987	25003	25004	25004	I	0	“ You ’ve only known her for as long as she ’s been dating Lukas , ”
25007	25053	25004	25004	I	0	“ And it ’s only because of him that she ’s gotten this carefree and outspoken , which , in her defense , is not a bad thing . I guess it ’s just what happens when you ’re in a happy and fulfilling relationship . ”
25054	25058	25059	25059	Julian	110	“ You guess ? ”
25067	25075	25062	25062	My	0	“ Yes . I can only guess . ”
25076	25081	25082	25082	Julian	110	“ That ’s right . ”
25105	25117	25118	25118	he	110	“ Fulfilling was the opposite of the last relationship you had , ”
25130	25141	25121	25121	he	110	“ See you back at the office , Ms. Hanna . ”
25307	25318	25319	25319	Colin	130	“ Sure you do n’t want to come with us ? ”
25332	25341	25319	25319	Colin	130	“ Is it because of the pineapple shorts ? ”
25348	25360	25319	25319	Colin	130	“ Oh God , it ’s because of the pineapple shorts . ”
25361	25371	25372	25372	I	0	“ It ’s not because of the pineapple shorts , ”
25531	25533	25522	25522	LIA	101	“ reasonably ”
25596	25601	25580	25580	I	0	“ Jesus , Lia , ”
25615	25626	25627	25627	She	101	“ reasonably sexy summer clothes , but nothing too crazy . ”
25694	25697	25698	25698	he	130	“ Whoa , ”
25759	25766	25767	25767	he	130	“ You look … very wow , ”
25797	25809	25810	25810	he	130	“ Oh Christ , he ’s gon na fire me now , ”
25881	25887	25872	25872	his	110	“ Sara . A word . ”
25918	25929	25930	25930	I	0	“ I need you to change out of that first . ”
25933	25937	25930	25930	I	0	“ Excuse me ? ”
25938	25953	25954	25954	Julian	110	“ That ’s not workplace appropriate . Put on what you were wearing before , ”
26094	26100	26101	26101	I	0	“ Was that really necessary ? ”
26115	26124	26125	26125	he	110	“ You ca n’t dress like that here , ”
26141	26152	26125	26125	he	110	“ Everyone changed after work today . Not just me . ”
26153	26171	26172	26172	Julian	110	“ Everyone changed into something casual , like a summer dress , or a polo and shorts . ”
26183	26199	26174	26174	his	110	“ Denim panties were n’t what I had in mind when I sent that memo . ”
26200	26206	26207	26207	I	0	“ Well , I apologize , ”
26218	26262	26207	26207	I	0	“ But I do feel the need to point out that several other women in this office left in dresses that were the same length as my shorts , with no sleeves , and you did n’t call them in to reprimand them . ”
26263	26272	26273	26273	he	110	“ You ’re right . I did n’t , ”
26344	26357	26358	26358	Julian	110	“ So , I do n’t get an explanation for that inconsistency ? ”
26372	26375	26376	26376	he	110	“ No , ”
26386	26413	26414	26414	I	0	“ That hardly seems fair , and again , I ca n’t help but suspect you ’re treating me differently than the rest of the office , ”
26418	26480	26414	26414	I	0	“ Actually , you are treating me differently than the rest of the office . The fact of the matter is , I know why you ’re singling me out . We both do . And for you to use that as a reason to make my life difficult today is completely unfair given your problem is something you alone created . ”
26513	26524	26507	26507	my	0	“ if you want to fuck me , then fuck me ”
26538	26552	26553	26553	he	110	“ And for what reason do you think I ’m singling you out ? ”
26556	26573	26553	26553	he	110	“ Can I say it or do I need to use your beloved corporate - speak ? ”
26574	26579	26535	26535	his	110	“ Just say it . ”
26580	26590	26591	26591	I	0	“ Because you want to fuck me , Julian , ”
26595	26628	26591	26591	I	0	“ You want to fuck me , you wo n’t let yourself fuck me , so you ’re taking it out on me – since that makes so much sense , right ? ”
26640	26691	26629	26629	I	0	“ Right . Well , if you have nothing left to say , then I ’m going to go . I have to find some Starbucks to change in now , and I ’m pretty sure I ’ll be late to meet the guys for happy hour , so bye . ”
26692	26698	26725	26725	him	110	“ Who are you meeting ? ”
26727	26734	26735	26735	I	0	“ Guys from Kinsley - Weiss , ”
26765	26771	26751	26751	I	0	“ Just you and them ? ”
26772	26778	26751	26751	I	0	“ Just me and them . ”
26779	26790	26791	26791	I	0	“ I thought you were going to drinks with Colin . ”
26799	26841	26791	26791	I	0	“ I decided against it . He works in my office , so it ’s probably safer to have drinks with men I do n’t run the risk of losing my job with should I choose to go home with them . ”
26868	26879	26864	26864	his	110	“ So your plan is to sleep with someone tonight . ”
26880	26893	26894	26894	I	0	“ That ’s none of your business , and I ’m leaving , ”
26931	26954	26923	26923	he	110	“ It ’s every bit my business when you ’re going with people I know , and in particular do n’t trust . ”
26961	27034	27035	27035	I	0	“ You strike me as someone who does n’t trust , period , and we ’ve already established the parameters of your authority over me , Julian . Yes , you can tell me what I can and can not wear , but no , you do n’t get to decide where I go after work or who I want to fuck , especially when I ’m the one waiting for you , ”
27038	27062	27035	27035	I	0	“ You ’re the one with the rule , so either make a move , asshole , or get out of my way . ”
27095	27102	27103	27103	he	639	“ Take a seat , Sara , ”
27106	27113	27103	27103	he	639	“ Julian , I told you – ”
27114	27123	27124	27124	I	0	“ Unbutton your shirt before you sit down . ”
27151	27162	27163	27163	I	0	“ What exactly are you asking of me right now ? ”
27166	27195	27163	27163	I	0	“ I ’m asking you to take a seat in front of my desk , Sara . And I want you to take your shirt off for me . ”
27268	27271	27272	27272	he	110	“ Unbutton , ”
27294	27297	27290	27290	he	110	“ Slowly . ”
27301	27309	27298	27298	I	0	“ Are you going to fuck me ? ”
27310	27337	27338	27338	I	0	“ I do n’t enjoy contradicting myself . If you ’re making me break my rule , I ’m going to take my time with you . ”
27453	27456	27457	27457	he	110	“ Slow , ”
27492	27504	27489	27489	He	110	“ Am I exhausting your patience right now , Ms. Hanna ? ”
27505	27510	27489	27489	He	110	“ You ’ve been . ”
27538	27554	27515	27515	I	0	“ You ’re torturing me , actually , but I realize that ’s the point . ”
27555	27563	27564	27564	he	110	“ You do pick things up quickly , ”
27577	27587	27588	27588	He	110	“ You know what I want to see next . ”
27730	27735	27736	27736	he	110	“ Keep it on , ”
27739	27745	27736	27736	he	110	“ Stand up for me . ”
27749	27754	27755	27755	I	0	“ Let me guess , ”
27836	27840	27841	27841	he	110	“ Do it , ”
27844	27848	27841	27841	he	110	“ Touch yourself . ”
28111	28114	28115	28115	I	0	“ Julian . ”
28208	28213	28214	28214	he	110	“ Stand for me , ”
28320	28324	28325	28325	Julian	110	“ Three days . ”
28339	28349	28350	28350	He	110	“ You got me to break in three days . ”
28387	28392	28393	28393	he	110	“ Look at me , ”
28416	28428	28429	28429	he	110	“ You do know you ’re playing with fire , right ? ”
28455	28458	28440	28440	I	0	“ Yes . ”
28510	28513	28514	28514	His	110	“ Good . ”
28615	28627	28612	28612	his	110	“ You should see how fucking sexy you look right now . ”
28628	28639	28612	28612	his	110	“ Why do n’t you just make me feel it ? ”
28640	28650	28670	28670	he	110	“ I ’ll be fucking you harder for that . ”
28651	28655	28656	28656	I	0	“ Do it , ”
28787	28794	28795	28795	he	110	“ Is this what you wanted ? ”
28802	28819	28820	28820	He	110	“ Or do you want me to pin you down and fuck you on the floor ? ”
28829	28842	28843	28843	he	110	“ Where do you want me to fuck you tomorrow , Sara ? ”
28870	28878	28864	28864	he	110	“ I do n’t care , Julian . ”
28886	28899	28864	28864	he	110	“ I just want you to fuck me and make me come . ”
28900	28929	28930	28930	His	110	“ I will . You ’ve opened the floodgates , Sara , so I have every intention of fucking you whenever and however I want in this office . ”
28941	28952	28953	28953	He	110	“ And I promise I ’ll make that pussy come . ”
28959	28962	28953	28953	He	110	“ Again . ”
28965	28969	28970	28970	I	0	“ And again . ”

29003	29017	29018	29018	he	110	“ I may just have to carry you home when I ’m done , ”
29073	29095	29065	29065	he	110	“ You ’re such a good girl in my office . Who knew I could get you to be so loud ? ”
29096	29100	29101	29101	I	0	“ Screw you , ”
29383	29388	29389	29389	Julian	110	“ Look at me , ”

30312	30326	30302	30302	Emmett	113	“ Think it ’s cool if I bring a girl again this week ? ”
30327	30338	30302	30302	Emmett	113	“ No . I think it 's cruel , actually . ”
30339	30346	30347	30347	Emmett	113	“ To who ? The girl ? ”

30372	30404	30405	30405	Emmett	113	“ Mom . You ’re teasing her with the idea of marriage despite the fact that we all know you ’re going to take another fifteen to twenty years for that . ”
30425	30433	30434	30434	he	113	“ You guys give me no credit , ”
30443	30481	30434	30434	he	113	“ I date a lot in order to effectively assess my preferences , as well as her true potential . I ’m sure you can understand that , especially since I phrased it in Julian - speak . ”
30482	30486	30547	30547	he	113	“ Very nice . ”
30487	30514	30434	30434	he	113	“ I do n’t appreciate the sarcasm , but at least I can take comfort in the fact that I ’ll still get married before you . ”

30579	30594	30573	30573	I	0	“ Would that be worth it though ? Jail time means no fucking Sara . ”
30595	30603	30547	30547	he	113	“ Do n’t talk about fucking her . ”
30604	30615	30616	30616	I	0	“ I ’m talking about you fucking her , asshole . ”
30627	30640	30641	30641	I	0	“ Do n’t talk about her in general is what I mean , ”
30649	30683	30641	30641	I	0	“ And in case you still smell like last night ’s tequila , I suggest you shower now and get going so you ’re not thirty minutes late like you were last week . ”
30684	30700	30701	30701	I	0	“ Fine . Hey , anyone ever tell you how much fun you ’re not ? ”

30844	30860	30831	30831	I	0	“ Since when have you been eager for me to take work calls on Sundays ? ”
30861	30866	30867	30867	she	137	“ I ’m not , ”
30994	31054	30985	30985	I	0	“ I just figured it might be someone important calling . And yes , I know , ‘ it ’s always someone important calling , ’ but considering you ’ve let two whole calls go to voicemail since we ’ve been here , I thought maybe something , or someone had taken your mind off of work for once . ”
31055	31077	31078	31078	I	0	“ Emmett introduces you to a new girlfriend every week . Why not pin your hopes of grandchildren on him instead ? ”
31081	31100	31078	31078	I	0	“ Because of that reason exactly . He ’s not going to settle down with anyone anytime soon . ”
31101	31108	31109	31109	Emmett	113	“ You do n’t know that ! ”
31170	31176	31177	31177	Emmett	113	“ Gram , no more , ”

31488	31505	31447	31447	Mom	137	“ Despite being a kid myself . I was ten when you had me babysitting everyone . ”
31506	31537	31538	31538	she	137	“ But you had fun , remember ? You loved making up games to keep them distracted . I ca n’t even count the number of tantrums you saved us , ”
31550	31570	31538	31538	she	137	“ You ’re like your father . Very stern , very serious . But you light up around children . ”
31571	31574	31575	31575	I	0	“ Mom , ”
31578	31583	31575	31575	I	0	“ Okay , alright . ”
31598	31623	31624	31624	she	137	“ I ’m sorry . I was just going through the old photo albums last night , and I found so many baby pictures , ”
31627	31647	31624	31624	she	137	“ I actually have a nice one of Lucie . I do n’t know if you might want that . ”

31765	31774	31775	31775	I	0	“ Yes . Your drooling , orange grandchild , ”
31834	31880	31829	31832	father - son resemblance	703	“ Anyway , I meant to tell you I made a reservation at Greta ’s for Father ’s Day next week , since that ’s Dad ’s favorite . All six of your cousins will be in attendance this year . Significant others , too . ”
31881	31886	31887	31887	I	0	“ That sounds good , ”
31911	31935	31901	31901	I	0	“ There ’s a slight chance I ’ll be away on business , but I doubt it ’ll fall on Father ’s Day . ”
31936	31939	31940	31940	Her	140	“ Oh . ”
31946	31954	31940	31940	Her	140	“ Are you finally selling the thing ? ”
31982	32003	31979	31979	I	0	“ Yes . As soon as possible , and hopefully to Turner and Carter Roth . You ’ve met them . ”
32004	32013	31961	31961	she	140	“ Oh yes , I remember those two . ”
32014	32049	32050	32050	I	0	“ Yeah , they ’re … idiots . But idiots that can do a lot of good for this stadium . Their resources can help us make this stadium what we all dreamed of , ”
32088	32096	32097	32097	she	137	“ You ’ve been working so hard , ”
32105	32124	32097	32097	she	137	“ They would both be so proud of you , Julian . I sincerely hope you know that . ”
32181	32195	32171	32171	Mom	137	“ Emmett , maybe you should get him a brother to play with . ”
32196	32218	32171	32171	Mom	137	“ Ma , you got ta be kidding me . Ozzy ’s three . I ca n’t handle another one now . ”
32219	32237	32171	32171	Mom	137	“ I read somewhere it ’s not good to keep a dog without giving it a friend . ”
32238	32241	32242	32242	Emmett	113	“ Mom . ”
32248	32255	32256	32256	he	113	“ Stop with the grandkid thing , ”
32259	32268	32256	32256	he	113	“ Ask Julian about a girl named Sara . ”
32277	32280	32269	32269	Mom	137	“ Who ? ”

32586	32590	32591	32591	I	0	“ You would , ”
32597	32611	32612	32612	Turner	108	“ Yeah , I do n’t even know how you two are related , ”
32623	32639	32615	32616	some girl	397	“ Anyway , listen , I know we said we were gon na meet tomorrow … ”
32640	32650	32615	32616	some girl	397	“ You ’re not going to cancel on me . ”
32651	32690	32691	32691	he	108	“ Easy , Hoult . I was n’t going to cancel , I was gon na say I know we set it for noon at your office tomorrow , but some … thing just came up for me , ”
32699	32736	32691	32691	he	108	“ I ’m in Miami right now , and I ’m actually going to be flying back to New York at around five tomorrow , so what do you say we all meet up around six ? ”
32779	32787	32788	32788	I	0	“ Where do you want to meet ? ”
32791	32816	32788	32788	I	0	“ I really liked that hotel you set me up with a couple weeks back . When I fucked that thing with the ass ? ”
32817	32820	32691	32691	he	108	“ Cass . ”
32821	32879	32788	32788	I	0	“ Jesus , you really do n’t forget shit . Yeah , her . They have a few rooftop bars there . A few pools . Figured we could have our meeting on a nice part of the roof with a good view – get ourselves some sun to set the mood to talk Biarritz . Right ? ”
32880	32892	32893	32893	He	716	“ It ’s going to be ninety degrees out , Turner . ”
32903	32944	32945	32945	he	716	“ Oh , I know . Did you hear me say pools ? Besides , you can just wear a T - shirt and shorts – you know I do n’t give a fuck . Keep it casual for once , ”
32961	32990	32945	32945	he	716	“ Matter fact , I have a surprise for Sara , so you should both bring swimsuits , actually . Or something you do n’t mind getting wet . ”
32998	33006	32945	32945	he	716	“ That ’s not happening at all . ”
33007	33034	32945	32945	he	716	“ Do n’t say that to me . Also , I sent a little gift basket to your office . Should get there by tomorrow morning . ”
33035	33040	33041	33041	I	0	“ What is it ? ”
33044	33079	33080	33080	Turner	108	“ Anthrax – the fuck do you think it is ? It ’s surfing gear from my line . Shit that sold out in stores the week it hit , so you ’re welcome , ”
33118	33140	33141	33141	I	0	“ Jesus Christ , Turner . I ’ll talk to you tomorrow . Six o’clock at the top of The Victorian , ”
33155	33162	33141	33141	I	0	“ See you there , buddy . ”
33637	33640	33645	33645	Julian	110	“ Hey . ”

33700	33705	33706	33706	I	0	“ I ’m fine , ”
33821	33827	33828	33828	Julian	110	“ You spilled on yourself , ”

33928	33932	33916	33916	Sara	100	“ bang it out ”
33960	33964	33953	33953	Julian	110	“ my office . ”
33982	34015	33969	33969	I	0	“ So , I know you ’re probably prepared to meet with the Roths in a few hours , but I should let you know they postponed our meeting till six tonight . ”
34030	34033	34034	34034	I	0	“ Really ? ”
34051	34061	34047	34047	we	741	“ Actually , yeah . That sounds about right . ”
34062	34087	34047	34047	we	741	“ It does , does n’t it ? Though I should ’ve told you to save your initial surprise for the location he chose . ”
34088	34097	34098	34098	I	0	“ Oh no . Where did he choose ? ”
34148	34156	34141	34141	he	110	“ He wants us at the hotel . ”
34157	34161	34162	34162	I	0	“ The hotel ? ”
34165	34169	34162	34162	I	0	“ The Victorian . ”
34183	34192	34170	34170	Julian	110	“ I believe you ’re familiar with it . ”
34199	34202	34170	34170	Julian	110	“ Yes . ”
34219	34223	34207	34207	I	0	“ I am . ”
34273	34276	34277	34277	he	110	“ Unfortunately , ”
34298	34325	34277	34277	he	110	“ We wo n’t be meeting in the comfort of a room tonight so much as some private part of the roof , despite this weather . ”
34331	34339	34326	34326	I	0	“ We ’re going to be burning . ”
34340	34380	34381	34381	I	0	“ I know . I ’m not entirely sure what Turner has up his sleeve for tonight , but as you can see , he sent us a lot of surfing gear that we really have no use for . ”
34386	34392	34381	34381	I	0	“ What is he on ? ”
34393	34415	34326	34326	I	0	“ I wish I knew . But he did say the surprise he had in store for us tonight required swimsuits . ”
34429	34470	34471	34471	I	0	“ And while I have no intentions for either of us to play into the swimsuit request , I would recommend you either go home and find a change of clothes or take this to buy something lightweight for tonight . ”
34486	34501	34502	34502	he	110	“ Company expense . You can either buy something or grab it from home , ”
34516	34549	34502	34502	he	110	“ Whichever option you choose , feel free to take the day off till six , since you ’ll be working from then till presumably eight or nine o ’ clock tonight . ”
34550	34553	34554	34554	I	0	“ Oh . ”
34627	34635	34636	34636	I	0	“ Should I … leave right now ? ”
34639	34647	34636	34636	I	0	“ Yes , I ’d prefer that . ”
34663	34697	34698	34698	he	110	“ I was a little eager to make use of the time that opened up after the Roths rescheduled , so I have back - to - back meetings starting in fifteen minutes , ”
34708	34733	34705	34705	he	110	“ In case I ’m not being clear enough , I do n’t regard fifteen minutes as enough time to do anything for pleasure . ”
34745	34752	34705	34705	he	110	“ Thank you for the clarification . ”
34753	34759	34791	34791	his	110	“ You ’re very welcome . ”
34760	34783	34784	34784	Julian	110	“ But in that case , I should remind you of what you subjected me to on my first day working here . ”
34803	34841	34800	34800	I	0	“ Bluntly put , Mr. Hoult , you licked my pussy in the elevator for about six seconds before you had to stop . In your opinion , that was what we had time for , so , ”
34848	34870	34842	34842	I	0	“ I ca n’t help but imagine that fourteen minutes is more than enough time for what I have in mind . ”
34883	34894	34875	34875	he	110	“ And what is it that you have in mind ? ”
34895	34908	34842	34842	I	0	“ I want to finish what I started the night we met . ”
34909	34913	34875	34875	he	110	“ Please clarify . ”
34914	34925	34926	34926	I	0	“ I want your cock in my mouth , Julian , ”
34937	34949	34926	34926	I	0	“ And this time , I want to make you come . ”
34965	34971	34972	34972	he	110	“ You ’re killing me , ”
35038	35043	35031	35031	he	110	“ Close the door . ”
35077	35087	35088	35088	Julian	110	“ You ’ve got to be fucking kidding me . ”
35216	35222	35223	35223	Julian	110	“ What are you doing ? ”
35289	35293	35294	35294	he	110	“ Fucking hell , ”
35375	35378	35379	35379	His	110	“ Fuck . ”
35406	35411	35412	35412	Julian	110	“ Christ , Sara , ”
35550	35565	35566	35566	I	0	“ Hey , Julian . McKinley ’s here a little early for the meeting . ”
35676	35693	35694	35694	Julian	110	“ If you could get him water or coffee for now , that ’d be great , ”
35707	35718	35694	35694	Julian	110	“ I ’ll meet him in the conference room shortly . ”
35719	35731	35743	35743	his	110	“ Great . He says Eli could n’t make it because – ”
35732	35737	35738	35738	Julian	110	“ That ’s fine , ”
35770	35779	35780	35780	he	110	“ That ’s fine . Just … go , ”
35784	35791	35780	35780	he	110	“ I ’ll be there soon . ”
35921	35925	35926	35926	he	110	“ Get up , ”
35938	35944	35945	35945	Julian	110	“ Give me your panties . ”
36061	36068	36069	36069	he	110	“ Was that amusing for you ? ”
36094	36104	36091	36091	his	110	“ You enjoyed tormenting me , did n’t you ? ”
36113	36116	36091	36091	his	110	“ Yes . ”
36117	36144	36145	36145	Julian	110	“ I could feel you smiling against my cock while I was talking to Colin . I ’m glad you had so much fun with that , ”
36185	36195	36196	36196	Julian	110	“ But now that you ’ve had your fun – ”
36212	36221	36222	36222	He	110	“ – I ’m going to have mine . ”
36316	36320	36297	36297	He	110	“ Holy shit . ”
36515	36518	36512	36512	his	110	“ Julian ! ”
36592	36597	36569	36569	he	110	“ Oh my God . ”
36708	36715	36689	36689	His	110	“ Oh my God , Julian … ”
36716	36725	36726	36726	His	110	“ Fuck , I ’m going to come . ”
36779	36784	36785	36785	Julian	110	“ Fuck , Sara , ”

37170	37184	37166	37166	she	100	“ I thought you ’d be upstairs already . It ’s past six . ”
37185	37198	37199	37199	I	0	“ Yes . Turner has kept me painfully aware of the time , ”
37212	37218	37199	37199	I	0	“ He ’s early again . ”
37219	37229	37166	37166	she	100	“ Shocking , actually . And you ’re late . ”
37230	37241	37166	37166	she	100	“ I preferred to wait for you to go in . ”
37242	37257	37199	37199	I	0	“ Mm . Did n’t think I could handle being alone with those two ? ”
37258	37286	37166	37166	she	100	“ No , I did n’t want those two to see the way I looked at you tonight . I needed some time to react alone first . ”
37287	37290	37199	37199	I	0	“ Oh . ”
37332	37340	37341	37341	Sara	100	“ So have you fully reacted yet ? ”
37355	37358	37359	37359	I	0	“ Almost , ”

37669	37689	37663	37663	Julian	110	“ I ’m not drinking tequila with these guys . We ’ll get actual drinks when this is over . ”
37752	37771	37772	37772	Turner	108	“ Obviously , we ’re going to need more than a few rooms when we go out there , ”
37798	37824	37825	37825	He	109	“ It ’s not gon na be just me and Carter out there . I ’ve got my business advisors , financial consultants , lawyers . ”
37901	37910	37911	37911	Julian	110	“ I look forward to meeting your advisors , ”
37915	37945	37911	37911	Julian	110	“ You should . They ’re smart men . I ’m bringing the whole fuckin ’ team , and they sure as shit ai n’t gon na share rooms . ”
37946	37978	37979	37979	Julian	110	“ It ’s high season , but once you agree on an actual date , I ’ll be sure to call the resort to arrange for the proper amount of suites , ”
37982	38006	37979	37979	Julian	110	“ Yeah … I ’m bringing a bunch of old fucks who sleep at like , ten , so their rooms actually matter , ”
38044	38066	38033	38033	he	108	“ The four of us though … I hope you know we ’re going to have some late nights in Biarritz . ”
38067	38073	38074	38074	Julian	110	“ And why is that ? ”
38077	38126	38074	38074	Julian	110	“ Well , I have n’t been out there in years , and you two are the experts . You got ta show me where the gems are . I got ta feel like I wanna take my business to that town , you know what I mean ? ”
38127	38143	38144	38144	Julian	110	“ That just sounds like an excuse for you to get shitfaced instead of work , ”
38181	38204	38205	38205	Julian	110	“ What can I say ? You know me by now , Hoult . I work hard , and I play hard . ”
38248	38280	38236	38236	he	110	“ Well , regardless , I ’ll at least have your advisors on board at that point . That ’ll guarantee me at least a couple sober minds to talk to . ”
38281	38306	38307	38307	Turner	108	“ Yeah , maybe you can all talk shop and sleep at ten while I take Sara out for drinks . How about that ? ”
38317	38326	38327	38327	Julian	110	“ How about we get back on topic ? ”
38832	38838	38839	38839	I	0	“ What ’s going on ? ”
38856	38883	38884	38884	I	0	“ Oh , I was just telling Julian that before we set a date for the trip , we got ta make sure of one thing . ”
38889	38894	38884	38884	I	0	“ What ’s that ? ”
38900	38912	38897	38897	his	108	“ We got ta make sure you know how to surf . ”
39048	39050	39044	39044	He	108	“ Sarah ”
39098	39118	39119	39119	he	108	“ Could n’t possibly commit to a date for the trip till I knew Sara had the basics down , ”
39135	39160	39119	39119	he	108	“ Besides , you ca n’t possibly say no when I went to such great lengths to make this a nice night . Right ? ”
39245	39267	39268	39268	he	108	“ He ’s trying to see how much he can get me to do for free before committing to the trip , ”
39295	39309	39291	39291	his	108	“ And , obviously , he wants to see you in a swimsuit . ”
39310	39316	39317	39317	I	0	“ I figured as much , ”
39361	39443	39356	39356	I	0	“ It ’s not a big deal , Julian . We ’ll take a swim , we ’ll pretend to party for him , and then we ’ll set a date for the trip . If humoring Turner gets us to Biarritz and connects you with his advisors , it ’s worth it . At least then you wo n’t have to deal with trying to talk to him or Carter about business they clearly do n’t know how to discuss . ”
39467	39470	39471	39471	I	0	“ What ? ”
39492	39498	39489	39489	his	110	“ That was oddly arousing . ”
39499	39503	39471	39471	I	0	“ What was ? ”
39504	39520	39521	39521	I	0	“ You taking control . I can only imagine how good you look on top . ”
39527	39542	39521	39521	I	0	“ We can find out tonight . That is , if you ’re interested . ”
39543	39558	39559	39559	Julian	110	“ I think you know at this point that I ’m interested , Sara , ”
39566	39575	39562	39562	his	110	“ Whether I want to be or not . ”
39580	39589	39562	39562	his	110	“ You had to add that last part ? ”
39590	39596	39562	39562	his	110	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
39597	39607	39608	39608	I	0	“ I do n’t know . Because it hurt , ”
39612	39623	39624	39624	Julian	110	“ You know what it ’s like to have rules , ”
39629	39640	39624	39624	Julian	110	“ You should know how it feels to break them . ”
39641	39653	39654	39654	I	0	“ It ’s felt nothing but good for me so far , ”
39663	39676	39659	39659	Turner	108	“ But I take it you regret what ’s happened between us . ”
40246	40254	40255	40255	I	0	“ You are so , so bad … ”
40451	40456	40459	40459	Turner	108	“ There she is . ”
41080	41088	41089	41089	Turner	108	“ You look good in this swimsuit , ”
41156	41164	41165	41165	he	108	“ Riding is n’t the hard part , ”
41178	41191	41165	41165	he	108	“ Paddling out then popping up – that ’s half the battle . ”
41354	41356	41337	41337	he	108	“ waves ”
41585	41593	41600	41600	I	0	“ was trying to fuck with him . ”
41594	41599	41600	41600	I	0	“ Dolphins are smart , ”
41604	41611	41612	41612	Turner	108	“ And a little shitty sometimes , ”
41615	41662	41612	41612	Turner	108	“ He was circling me like he knew that ’s what sharks do in the movies . Then right when I was gon na have a heart attack , he popped up with this big smile , like ‘ psych , got you , bitch . ’ ”
41733	41738	41739	41739	He	108	“ What are these ? ”
41761	41764	41750	41750	I	0	“ Whoa . ”
41791	41797	41784	41784	he	108	“ Sore spot , eh ? ”
41798	41806	41807	41807	I	0	“ That ’s incredibly rude , Turner , ”
41825	41833	41834	41834	he	108	“ What , are you embarrassed now ? ”
41837	41858	41834	41834	he	108	“ Do n’t be . Nothing wrong with having a bit of a dark side . Lord knows I do . ”
41890	41893	41886	41886	he	108	“ Roth . ”
41927	41935	41936	41936	Julian	110	“ We ’re done here , correct ? ”
41952	41964	41965	41965	Turner	108	“ She did great . Ca n’t fucking wait for Biarritz , ”
41999	42013	41986	41986	Julian	110	“ Perfect . Have your assistants email Colin or me in the morning . ”
42014	42023	42024	42024	I	0	“ You got it . Hey , Sara . ”
42052	42062	42063	42063	he	108	“ What ’s the ‘ F ’ stand for ? ”
42108	42113	42114	42114	I	0	“ Goodnight , Turner , ”
42117	42124	42114	42114	I	0	“ Drink lots of water tonight . ”
42132	42141	42168	42169	the Roths	114	“ Ai n’t my first rodeo , love . ”
42411	42419	42403	42403	Julian	110	“ What did Turner say to you ? ”
42442	42448	42449	42449	My	0	“ Not much , actually . ”
42462	42472	42449	42449	My	0	“ What ’s going on ? Are you okay ? ”
42642	42647	42648	42648	I	0	“ I ca n’t … ”
42692	42698	42699	42699	My	0	“ I need a minute . ”
42725	42733	42718	42718	Julian	110	“ You ’re having a panic attack . ”
42734	42738	42718	42718	Julian	110	“ I know . ”
42739	42760	42761	42761	he	110	“ If you ’ve had them before , then you know everything is going to be fine . Just breathe , ”
42790	42798	42774	42774	I	0	“ Do you know what triggers these ? ”
42799	42813	42761	42761	he	110	“ Lots of things . Have n’t had one in a long time . ”
42814	42823	42898	42898	he	110	“ What does it feel like right now ? ”
42824	42840	42841	42841	I	0	“ Ca n’t breathe . Heart ’s beating fast . Feels like I could die . ”
42855	42876	42841	42841	I	0	“ I know it sounds like I ’m being a drama queen . When I say that . I just – ”
42877	42893	42894	42894	Julian	110	“ I ’m informed on panic attacks . I know you ’re not being dramatic , ”
42908	42915	42898	42898	he	110	“ Stand up and turn around . ”
42916	42919	42898	42898	he	110	“ What ? ”
42931	42975	42926	42926	him	110	“ I ’m not about to fuck you in the middle of your panic attack , Sara , so do n’t look at me like that . I want you to run your wrists under the cold water and see if that helps . ”
43080	43087	43088	43088	I	0	“ You ’ve seen everything already , ”
43105	43118	43088	43088	I	0	“ I ’m not interested in getting hard right now , Sara . ”
43166	43173	43174	43174	I	0	“ Do you get them too ? ”
43177	43180	43174	43174	I	0	“ What ? ”
43181	43185	43186	43186	He	110	“ Panic attacks . ”
43191	43194	43186	43186	He	110	“ No . ”
43210	43218	43219	43219	I	0	“ Where ’d you learn that trick ? ”
43256	43270	43271	43271	he	110	“ Let ’s get you home before Turner realizes we ’re still here , ”
43281	43290	43291	43291	I	0	“ How is everything so far , gentlemen ? ”
43453	43465	43466	43466	Lukas	102	“ We should be done with everything around Lia ’s birthday , ”
43469	43481	43466	43466	Lukas	102	“ So it can be a birthday - housewarming combo party . ”
43482	43506	43435	43435	he	102	“ Christ , you sound like you drive a mini van and shit on the refs at your kids ’ Little League games . ”
43507	43522	43523	43523	Lukas	102	“ That ’s actually the goal at some point , minus the ref abuse , ”
43526	43539	43540	43540	he	102	“ By the way , you should bring Sara to the party , ”
43553	43567	43540	43540	he	102	“ You should stop letting your girlfriend influence the things we talk about . ”
43568	43610	43611	43611	he	102	“ That suggestion was actually all mine , though I wo n’t deny that Lia ’s been rooting for you two to become some sort of thing . Which is strange , honestly , because she loves Sara , but you , ”
43614	43619	43611	43611	he	102	“ not so much . ”
43620	43641	43540	43540	he	102	“ I would say the feeling is mutual , but I ’d prefer you not throw a tantrum in public . ”
43642	43654	43655	43655	Lukas	102	“ Good call . Any decent man would defend his woman , ”
43658	43688	43655	43655	Lukas	102	“ I ’m sure you ’ve been well acquainted with the feeling lately . Something tells me you do n’t particularly enjoy watching the Roths slobber all over Sara . ”
43689	43695	43696	43696	I	0	“ You ’re not incorrect . ”
43931	43939	43940	43940	Emmett	113	“ Who are you texting , anyway ? ”
43951	43955	43945	43945	himself	102	“ No one . ”
43956	43967	43968	43968	Emmett	113	“ Well , no one sure has you worked up , ”
43999	44008	44009	44009	he	113	“ You have got to be shitting me , ”
44023	44031	44020	44020	I	0	“ Mind your own business , Emmett . ”
44032	44042	44050	44050	his	113	“ How the fuck is this not my business ? ”
44053	44069	44043	44043	he	113	“ I thought you were putting an official end to that chapter in your life . ”
44070	44088	44089	44089	Emmett	113	“ Trust me , I am . Do you not see me trying to sell that resort ? ”
44102	44136	44095	44095	he	113	“ You know , it ’s fucking crazy . You ’re a hard - ass ninety - nine - point - nine percent of the time , and then the other one percent – ”
44137	44143	44043	44043	he	113	“ Your math is off . ”
44144	44174	44175	44175	Emmett	113	“ Shut up . Listen to me . I do n’t ever give you shit , Julian . I ’m as easy as they come . You know that , ”
44179	44226	44175	44175	Emmett	113	“ So when I say that you need to cut that crazy person off , I fucking mean it . You do n’t owe anyone anything . Aside from your family – your real family – you should n’t have to break your back for anyone . ”
44398	44403	44404	44404	I	0	“ Move past it , ”
44408	44418	44404	44404	I	0	“ How much money are you sending this time ? ”
44419	44426	44427	44427	Emmett	113	“ I said move past it . ”
44488	44503	44482	44482	I	0	“ Fine , well now you owe me a couple minutes talking about Sara . ”
44504	44520	44445	44445	he	113	“ I ca n’t at all grasp why you ’re so interested in this topic . ”
44521	44559	44560	44560	Emmett	113	“ Well , I have n’t seen you actually invested in a girl in a long fucking time , and the sooner you settle down and have kids , the sooner Mom stops bugging me about it . ”
44570	44583	44560	44560	Emmett	113	“ You gon na take her on a real date anytime soon ? ”
44584	44588	44560	44560	Emmett	113	“ Absolutely not . ”
44589	44595	44560	44560	Emmett	113	“ Why the fuck not ? ”
44596	44611	44612	44612	Emmett	113	“ I see her every day at work . What more do I need ? ”
44627	44636	44637	44637	he	113	“ Wait . Is that a serious question ? ”
44662	44683	44684	44684	Lukas	102	“ He just said he ’ll never ask Sara out , because he already sees her at work every day . ”
44689	44699	44684	44684	Lukas	102	“ Jesus . Yeah , that sounds about right . ”
44731	44737	44738	44738	she	870	“ Is everything okay here ? ”
44742	44754	44755	44755	I	0	“ Yes , I ’ll just take the check , please , ”
44814	44841	44807	44807	I	0	“ You know , you ’re both fairly intolerable on a regular basis , but when your forces combine , it can really clear a room . ”
44842	44847	44848	44848	Emmett	113	“ You love us , ”
44864	44874	44875	44875	I	0	“ Enjoy the rest of your lunch , gentlemen , ”
44913	44916	44904	44904	Emmett	113	“ Hey . ”
44917	44920	44921	44921	He	113	“ What ? ”
44927	45021	45022	45022	I	0	“ Listen , do me a favor , alright ? Do n’t … text ol’ Crazy Person back till after Sunday . Give yourself a break from that shit , and just enjoy the good things going on right now , like the fact that you got a date set for this trip , the hard part is over , and you may or may not have a girl you ’re interested in . Focus on just the good . For the next five days . That ’s all I ask of you . ”
45025	45034	45022	45022	I	0	“ So live like you , you mean . ”
45035	45051	45052	45052	Emmett	113	“ Yes . Why the fuck else do you think I ’m always so happy ? ”
45061	45084	45052	45052	Emmett	113	“ If I like something , man , I let myself have it – without stressing myself out about the possible consequences . ”
45085	45097	45022	45022	I	0	“ That ’s incredibly reckless , I ’m sure you know . ”
45098	45119	45120	45120	Emmett	113	“ Of course . That ’s why I ’m not you . I ’m not a fuckin ’ workaholic billionaire , ”
45123	45198	45199	45199	he	113	“ But since you already are , you might as well give yourself a couple days to actually chill and indulge in the things you want . I ’m not telling you to take a whole week of sick days and bail on work , I ’m just telling you to relax for once . Do n’t force yourself to put out all the little fires . Just let them burn for a bit , ”
45202	45231	45199	45199	he	113	“ Till Sunday – how about that ? Then after our big fat Father ’s Day brunch , you can go back to being ol’ No Fun Julian . ”
45232	45242	45243	45243	Emmett	113	“ You really sold it with the last line . ”
45246	45249	45243	45243	Emmett	113	“ Right ? ”
45255	45260	45243	45243	Emmett	113	“ See you Sunday . ”
45261	45267	45268	45268	he	113	“ Just think about it ! ”
45281	45305	45306	45306	Mom	137	“ What kind of assignment is this ? You ’ve had a thousand deadlines , Sara . You would still always text back , ”
45402	45413	45414	45414	I	0	“ It ’s … a very complicated assignment , Mama , ”
45424	45452	45453	45453	Mom	137	“ Tell Robin you ca n’t work any more Sundays . Tell her that will put less pressure on you , and you ’ll have more energy , ”
45501	45510	45511	45511	I	0	“ I ’ll talk to her about it , ”
45622	45641	45642	45642	I	0	“ Listen , Ma – Robin ’s coming by , so I got ta get off the phone , ”
45671	45696	45656	45656	I	0	“ Yeah . Okay . I promise I ’ll call you tonight to talk longer . Okay , will do – bye - bye . ”
45770	45781	45764	45764	he	110	“ I ’m almost certain my name is n’t Robin . ”
45782	45795	45796	45796	I	0	“ Yes . It ’s not . It ’s just , um … ”
45801	45807	45796	45796	I	0	“ The thing is that – ”
45808	45826	45827	45827	he	110	“ It ’s okay , you do n’t have to explain if you do n’t want to , ”
45837	45854	45827	45827	he	110	“ I only came out here to see if you wanted to join me for lunch . ”
45859	45867	45827	45827	he	110	“ I thought you just had lunch ? ”
45868	45884	45796	45796	I	0	“ I spent it in poor company . I ’d like to do it over . ”
45885	45888	45889	45889	I	0	“ Oh . ”
45900	45911	45912	45912	I	0	“ Is this so we can discuss the Biarritz itinerary ? ”
45915	45940	45912	45912	I	0	“ No . Remember , we ’ll be doing that with Colin at three in the conference room . I reminded you this morning . ”
45941	45948	45889	45889	I	0	“ You did , I just – ”
45965	45969	45970	45970	I	0	“ Never mind , ”
45980	45986	45912	45912	I	0	“ Let ’s go eat . ”
46050	46057	46058	46058	I	0	“ Do you come here often ? ”
46065	46078	46058	46058	I	0	“ Not as often as other places . Why do you ask ? ”
46079	46086	46026	46027	the servers	888	“ You know everyone ’s names . ”
46087	46117	46118	46118	I	0	“ I try to remember names once they ’ve been given . It ’s only ever been helpful to me , especially when it comes to running a business . ”
46123	46143	46118	46118	I	0	“ That makes sense . Is that the trick to owning the empire that you do at your age ? ”
46144	46149	46150	46150	he	884	“ One of several , ”
46153	46176	46150	46150	he	884	“ It also took a fair amount of sleepless nights and busting my ass . Nothing you do n’t know about though . ”
46222	46248	46249	46249	I	0	“ Yes , of course , all your ass - busting led to where you are now , whereas mine was apparently all in vain , ”
46255	46276	46249	46249	I	0	“ I do n’t know why I put so much time into that company when they treated me like shit . ”
46305	46327	46301	46301	He	884	“ I take it you do n’t want me to get you your job back there when our contract is finished . ”
46328	46337	46338	46338	I	0	“ No , actually . I do n’t , ”
46347	46364	46365	46365	he	884	“ Are there any other magazines under Hoult Publishing that you ’d like to work for ? ”
46368	46371	46365	46365	he	884	“ Several , ”
46388	46407	46383	46383	I	0	“ Actually , one magazine in particular is the reason I even switched majors to journalism in college . ”
46408	46411	46412	46412	He	884	“ Really ? ”
46418	46421	46412	46412	He	884	“ Which ? ”
46422	46426	46427	46427	I	0	“ Una Magazine , ”
46430	46443	46427	46427	I	0	“ I think your company acquired it two or three years ago . ”
46444	46447	46448	46448	I	0	“ Four . ”
46462	46486	46451	46451	God	107	“ Right . It ’s named after The Una , which was one of the first women ’s periodicals back in the day . ”
46487	46494	46448	46448	I	0	“ The eighteen hundreds , correct ? ”
46495	46501	46502	46502	I	0	“ Eighteen fifty - three , ”
46512	46523	46502	46502	I	0	“ You keep knowing more than I think you would . ”
46524	46532	46533	46533	I	0	“ Thank you , I ’m sure . ”
46536	46590	46533	46533	I	0	“ It ’s a compliment . But anyway , that ’s pretty much my dream magazine . It had a very significant impact on me during my most formative years , and if I could work for them and help change even one other girl ’s life then I ’d be incredibly grateful . ”
46623	46642	46619	46619	Julian	107	“ I ’ll be sure to find you a position there when we ’re done with the Roths . ”
46648	46651	46643	46643	I	0	“ Really ? ”
46652	46668	46725	46725	his	107	“ Did I not promise you that when you first agreed to work for me ? ”
46669	46676	46643	46643	I	0	“ You did , I just … ”
46677	46683	46643	46643	I	0	“ Did n’t believe me . ”
46684	46721	46643	46643	I	0	“ I ’m pretty sure I believed you , but I really did n’t know you at all at the time , and I was n’t entirely sure anything coming out of your mouth was true . ”
46735	46740	46730	46730	his	107	“ That angers me . ”
46747	46782	46730	46730	his	107	“ It ’s not meant as a slight toward you , Julian . I just did n’t know you at all back then . I still do n’t know that much about you now . ”
46783	46791	46792	46792	His	107	“ What do you want to know ? ”
46811	46826	46827	46827	I	0	“ What do n’t I want to know is probably a more appropriate question , ”
46841	46845	46827	46827	I	0	“ Start small . ”
46869	46872	46873	46873	I	0	“ Okay . ”
46887	46900	46878	46879	two servers	893	“ You mentioned you have a brother . Tell me about him . ”
46901	46918	46956	46956	Julian	107	“ Emmett ? He ’s the one who barged in on us the night we met . ”
46919	46926	46927	46927	I	0	“ You ’ve mentioned that before , ”
46930	46940	46927	46927	I	0	“ And with deep irritation , might I add . ”
46941	46955	46956	46956	Julian	107	“ He lives to irritate me deeply , so that would make sense , ”
46975	47008	46964	46964	he	107	“ He ’s five years younger than me , and were it not for the fact that we share many of the same features , no one would believe we were related . ”
47009	47019	47020	47020	I	0	“ Now I ’m curious to see a picture , ”
47045	47053	47054	47054	he	107	“ I do n’t have many pictures , ”
47061	47073	47074	47074	he	107	“ This is about the best you ’re going to get , ”
47102	47110	47111	47111	I	0	“ Wow . Look at that smile , ”
47154	47164	47147	47147	they	895	“ You look so happy . When was this ? ”
47165	47199	47200	47200	I	0	“ Last year , when the Empires won the American League pennant . First time since the eighties , and the first time in my era of ownership , so that was nice . ”
47230	47236	47237	47237	I	0	“ And who ’s this ? ”
47307	47316	47317	47317	he	107	“ That ’s my grandma . Rosemarie Hoult , ”
47332	47365	47317	47317	he	107	“ She immigrated from Germany when she was eighteen , and the first thing she did when she arrived was go to a baseball game . She said it felt appropriately American . ”
47366	47371	47372	47372	I	0	“ Sounds about right , ”
47378	47390	47372	47372	I	0	“ I ’m going to assume it was an Empires game . ”
47391	47454	47317	47317	he	107	“ Absolutely . She was hell - bent on learning every detail of the game , and her sisters were very much disinterested , so she went alone , and eventually , my grandfather spotted her . He was an usher , and the day she sat in his section – according to him – he decided he had to marry her . ”
47455	47464	47372	47372	I	0	“ Oh God , that ’s too cute . ”
47465	47469	47470	47470	Julian	107	“ It is . ”
47493	47505	47479	47479	I	0	“ Needless to say , we grew up an Empires family . ”
47506	47514	47515	47515	I	0	“ And now you own the team . ”
47520	47541	47517	47517	my	0	“ If that ’s not the happiest story I ’ve ever heard , then I do n’t know what is . ”
47547	47571	47572	47572	he	107	“ Yes , well , there ’s certainly a lot that happened in between , but ultimately , it ’s a happy story , ”
47663	47670	47657	47657	I	0	“ Was there … something that – ”
47671	47678	47679	47679	Julian	107	“ Tell me about your family , ”
47713	47723	47706	47706	He	107	“ You told your mother my name was Robin . ”
47735	47750	47751	47751	I	0	“ If you ’d like to explain that now , I ’m all ears . ”
47765	47789	47754	47754	I	0	“ Robin was my last boss . I said her name because my mom … does n’t know I quit June Magazine yet . ”
47804	47836	47790	47790	I	0	“ She sees that place as my miracle job – prestigious , decent pay , full health benefits . So , I ’ve been acting as if I still work there . ”
47837	47860	47894	47894	He	107	“ Why ca n’t you tell her you now work for Hoult Communications ? I imagine that would sound even more prestigious . ”
47861	47878	47879	47879	I	0	“ Well , because my contract with Hoult Communications ends within a few months , sir , ”
47909	47920	47894	47894	He	107	“ I ’m glad you ’re so pleased with yourself . ”
47921	47930	47896	47896	his	107	“ Getting reactions out of you is fun . ”
47931	47940	47941	47941	he	107	“ I hope you and Emmett never meet , ”
47951	47972	47941	47941	he	107	“ Can you not tell your mom that after this contract is over , you ’ll be with Hoult Publishing ? ”
47979	48038	47973	47973	I	0	“ Again , this is no slight to you , but I would rather not tell her anything like that until a contract has been signed , and everything is solid . She is absolutely paranoid and untrusting when it comes to me , and she leaves no stone unturned when questioning even minor changes in my life . ”
48105	48122	48100	48100	he	107	“ Una Magazine is based near Columbus Circle . Is that close to where you live ? ”
48123	48150	48100	48100	he	107	“ No , but I can take the D train from Broadway - Lafayette . I live on Mulberry Street . I ’m a downtown girl . ”
48151	48157	48100	48100	he	107	“ I prefer downtown myself . ”
48158	48166	48100	48100	he	107	“ Oh ? Where do you live ? ”
48167	48170	48171	48171	I	0	“ TriBeCa . ”
48179	48193	48171	48171	I	0	“ Of course . I ’m sure you own entire buildings in TriBeCa . ”
48194	48210	48100	48100	he	107	“ No . Just one . But I have others nearby in SoHo and DUMBO . ”
48211	48218	48219	48219	I	0	“ I was just teasing you , ”
48222	48266	48219	48219	I	0	“ But thank you for reminding me of the full extent of your wealth . Meanwhile , I ’m just hoping I can afford to buy a five hundred - square - foot studio in this city before I turn thirty - five . ”
48267	48283	48100	48100	he	107	“ Well , I hear Una Magazine compensates well , so you ’re in luck . ”
48284	48288	48289	48289	I	0	“ Oh yeah ? ”
48294	48310	48289	48289	I	0	“ What else do you hear about Una , since you know so very much ? ”
48320	48338	48311	48311	He	901	“ I know it ’s a women ’s magazine that deals specifically with mental health and trauma . ”
48453	48456	48457	48457	I	0	“ Um . ”
48495	48506	48507	48507	Julian	110	“ Why did that particular magazine influence you so much ? ”
48555	48558	48559	48559	I	0	“ Reasons , ”
48568	48579	48559	48559	I	0	“ I ’m not sure that constitutes as an answer . ”
48580	48593	48594	48594	I	0	“ Why is n’t your purchase of the Empires a happy story ? ”
48601	48609	48597	48597	He	110	“ Touché . How ’s your paillard ? ”
48610	48614	48615	48615	I	0	“ Very good . ”
48620	48625	48615	48615	I	0	“ And your steak ? ”
48626	48629	48630	48630	We	905	“ Excellent . ”
48755	48765	48766	48766	I	0	“ Okay , I guess I ’ll see you … ”
48824	48831	48805	48805	he	110	“ Okay , later . Bye . ”
48849	48853	48844	48844	I	0	“ Shut up ! ”
49143	49150	49151	49151	She	100	“ Oh my God , Julian . ”
49165	49170	49151	49151	She	100	“ You scared me . ”
49171	49176	49196	49196	Her	100	“ I ’m sorry . ”
49177	49184	49185	49185	she	100	“ You do n’t sound it , ”
49208	49211	49200	49200	she	100	“ What ? ”
49212	49221	49222	49222	I	0	“ You did n’t respond to my text , ”
49236	49244	49222	49222	I	0	“ What was I supposed to say ? ”
49258	49267	49268	49268	I	0	“ You could have let me kiss you , ”
49271	49295	49268	49268	I	0	“ I ’ve done it before . In fact , I ’ve put my mouth on just about every part of your body . ”
49296	49313	49314	49314	she	100	“ Do n’t get me turned on right now . Colin should be here in ten , ”
49330	49342	49314	49314	she	100	“ He should be here now . Why is he late ? ”
49343	49388	49268	49268	I	0	“ Whoever he was meeting at the stadium was n’t there when he arrived , so he had to wait . He asked me to tell you , and he said he did n’t call because he did n’t want to disrupt your meeting . ”
49389	49399	49400	49400	I	0	“ Fair enough . Are those extras you printed ? ”
49412	49418	49400	49400	I	0	“ Yes . Want one ? ”
49419	49422	49423	49423	I	0	“ Please . ”
49473	49484	49467	49467	I	0	“ Are you peeking up my skirt , Mr. Hoult ? ”
49485	49488	49489	49489	I	0	“ Yes , ”
49496	49499	49500	49500	I	0	“ Colin , ”
49521	49542	49543	49543	I	0	“ Yes , she told me McKinley was n’t there when you got to the stadium . It ’s fine , ”
49608	49632	49633	49633	I	0	“ If he says he ’ll be there soon , just wait it out for him , Colin . You ’re already there , ”
49680	49701	49677	49677	I	0	“ I ’ll review the itinerary with Sara for now . We ’ll catch you up once you get back . ”
49702	49712	49713	49713	Sara	100	“ Wow . You are such an understanding boss , ”
49721	49727	49713	49713	Sara	100	“ What can I say . ”
49764	49780	49755	49755	I	0	“ Do me a favor . Read me the time of our flight next week ? ”
49781	49796	49806	49806	I	0	“ May I sit , or would you like me to stay like this ? ”
49797	49802	49803	49803	I	0	“ Stay like this , ”
49817	49825	49803	49803	I	0	“ Now what time is our flight ? ”
49845	49854	49855	49855	Sara	100	“ Six - fifteen private charter from Teterboro , ”
49869	49873	49874	49874	I	0	“ Good girl , ”
49884	49894	49874	49874	I	0	“ And what time do we arrive in Biarritz ? ”
49914	49918	49895	49895	Sara	100	“ We arrive … ”
49928	49937	49921	49921	her	100	“ Oh God , what are you doing ? ”
49938	49947	49925	49925	her	100	“ I ’m admiring how wet you are . ”
49948	49968	49921	49921	her	100	“ I mean are you going to do more than that ? Because I ca n’t take the teasing . ”
49969	49973	49974	49974	I	0	“ You can , ”
49979	49993	49974	49974	I	0	“ And you will . Now tell me what time our flight arrives . ”
49994	50001	50002	50002	Sara	100	“ Eight at night in Biarritz , ”
50040	50045	50046	50046	I	0	“ Not so loud , ”
50074	50077	50072	50072	her	100	“ thank God ”
50089	50105	50072	50072	her	100	“ Now tell me how much time we have in Biarritz before the Roths arrive . ”
50106	50154	50072	50072	her	100	“ You and I will be arriving the night before the Roths , so I can get acquainted with the property . Colin will be arriving the next morning , the same time that Turner , Carter and their advisors touch down . Oh God , Julian … ”
50180	50183	50184	50184	She	100	“ Julian … ”
50205	50213	50190	50190	she	100	“ Please . Tell me what now . ”
50214	50227	50228	50228	I	0	“ Unbutton your shirt . Only enough to pull your bra down , ”
50268	50272	50257	50257	she	100	“ What now ? ”
50285	50295	50273	50273	I	0	“ I want you to sit on my cock . ”
50351	50354	50355	50355	I	0	“ Easy , ”
50373	50376	50355	50355	I	0	“ Fuck . ”

50457	50462	50450	50450	she	100	“ Am I close ? ”
50463	50468	50483	50483	she	100	“ Few inches left . ”
50469	50482	50483	50483	she	100	“ Holy shit , I just felt you get so much harder , ”
50486	50493	50483	50483	she	100	“ Keep talking dirty like that . ”
50494	50501	50483	50483	she	100	“ I ’m not trying to . ”
50502	50510	50511	50511	I	0	“ That ’s why I like it , ”
50539	50542	50519	50519	she	100	“ Breathe . ”

50630	50635	50636	50636	I	0	“ Take it slow . ”
50646	50651	50636	50636	I	0	“ Breathe for me . ”

50948	50953	50945	50945	I	0	“ I warned you . ”
50954	50959	50960	50960	I	0	“ I liked it . ”
51008	51025	51026	51026	I	0	“ Come on my cock , Sara . I can feel your pussy tightening around me , ”
51093	51100	51088	51088	me	0	“ Come inside me , Julian . ”
51219	51246	51247	51247	she	100	“ I had a question about who would be giving the tour on day two . Is it going to be the staff there or me ? ”
51274	51306	51307	51307	I	0	“ It ’s going to be a bit of both , depending on how well acquainted we can get you with the resort in the time that we ’re there alone , ”
51380	51389	51390	51390	Lia	101	“ Thank God it ’s finally perfect out . ”
51484	51495	51480	51480	Lia	101	“ Maybe your sex life with Julian controls the weather . ”
51518	51535	51510	51510	I	0	“ I hesitate to ask , but what in the fresh hell are you talking about ? ”
51536	51544	51545	51545	she	101	“ How do you not see it ? ”
51548	51601	51545	51545	she	101	“ The heat wave came when you guys were being cold and mean to each other . Now it ’s gone because you ’ve been having nonstop sweaty office sex . And it ’s particularly cool out today because you guys … really went for it this morning , I mean damn . ”
51633	51643	51602	51602	She	101	“ I think he learned that move from Lukas . ”

51652	51655	51648	51648	I	0	“ Ew ! ”
51656	51685	51686	51686	Lia	101	“ What ? I ’m talking about the location , not the actual positions ! But fine , fine , Lukas did not invent fucking in the bathroom , ”
51824	51835	51836	51836	he	107	“ I need to get my fill before I go , ”
51878	51892	51893	51893	Lia	101	“ I take it all the people in the office know by now ? ”
51903	51911	51893	51893	Lia	101	“ That you ’re sleeping with Julian ? ”
51912	51929	51893	51893	Lia	101	“ I think if you say it any louder , Lia , they ’ll definitely know . ”
51930	51947	51948	51948	Lia	101	“ I ’m pretty sure it ’s not my volume that ’s giving you guys away , ”
51951	51970	51948	51948	Lia	101	“ Did you not tell me you guys had a moaning contest in the conference room on Wednesday ? ”
51971	51984	51893	51893	Lia	101	“ I ’m almost certain I did n’t phrase it that way . ”
51985	51994	51995	51995	Lia	101	“ You ’re starting to talk like him , ”
51998	52006	52007	52007	I	0	“ I take that as a compliment , ”
52010	52040	52007	52007	I	0	“ Oh God , you guys are gross . Your level of admiration for each other is almost self - congratulatory , because you ’re basically the same person . ”
52056	52061	52062	52062	Lia	101	“ It ’s true ! ”
52065	52112	52113	52113	Lia	101	“ But I secretly love that about you two . You both are very similar in great ways , and that ’s exactly why I called it in the first place that you ’d make an awesome couple . Me . Lia . I said it , ”
52120	52139	52115	52115	her	101	“ I actually made a bet about it , which reminds me that Lukas owes me twenty dollars . ”
52140	52146	52147	52147	I	0	“ Lukas bet against me ? ”
52152	52156	52147	52147	I	0	“ How rude . ”
52157	52172	52173	52173	Lia	101	“ In all fairness , he bet against Julian ’s ability to feel things , ”
52176	52219	52173	52173	Lia	101	“ That guy . I swear he never has girlfriends . He never even talks about flings or one - night stands , so we ’re not even fully sure that he has them . He ’s just so crazy about work . ”
52220	52237	52147	52147	I	0	“ Yeah , well … we ’ll see if this thing between us lasts past work . ”
52238	52245	52246	52246	Lia	101	“ What are you talking about ? ”
52257	52277	52278	52278	I	0	“ I do n’t know , Lia , nor do I really want to get into it right now , ”
52289	52335	52278	52278	I	0	“ My contract lasts three months or however long the Roth negotiations take . After that , I have trouble imagining that Julian is going to think much about me if I ’m not at his office and in front of his face every day . ”
52336	52343	52395	52395	Lia	101	“ You do n’t know that . ”
52344	52367	52368	52368	I	0	“ No , I do n’t know anything for sure , but I do know what the most realistic turnout would be , ”
52387	52394	52395	52395	Lia	101	“ And what would that be ? ”
52410	52513	52403	52403	I	0	“ That even if Julian Hoult did feel some tiny fraction of a thing for me , he would probably be really good at forcing himself to forget it if he had to . I mean look at who he is , where he ’s gotten himself . I ’m a workaholic , but he ’s a machine , and a month - long whirlwind is n’t going to affect a machine . It ’s just going to bounce off of him because he ’s made of steel . That ’s what it takes to run an empire like his . Right ? ”
52538	52543	52544	52544	she	101	“ Jesus , girl , ”
52547	52554	52544	52544	she	101	“ That ’s not the attitude . ”
52562	52585	52555	52555	I	0	“ Sorry . I just want to be a big girl about it now , so it does n’t hurt me later . ”
52586	52591	52592	52592	she	101	“ I get it , ”
52599	52610	52592	52592	she	101	“ You know I totally get that . I just … ”
52622	52641	52642	52642	she	101	“ I would n’t have snagged Lukas without you pushing me and being the little troublemaker you were , ”
52645	52707	52642	52642	she	101	“ Sometimes I think about what might have slipped through my fingers if you did n’t force me to woman up and just go for it with him . He ’s the best thing that ’s ever happened to me , and after all the shit you ’ve been through , I just want the best thing to happen to you . ”
52708	52713	52723	52723	she	101	“ Daw . Lia . ”
52730	52735	52736	52736	I	0	“ I appreciate that , ”
52746	52749	52739	52739	she	101	“ sorry , ”
52765	52787	52762	52762	I	0	“ But hey , have you ever considered that maybe you ’re the best thing that ’s ever happened to me ? ”
52788	52797	52798	52798	she	101	“ Oh , I agree wholeheartedly I am , ”
52805	52830	52798	52798	she	101	“ But I ’m the best thing in a different category . There ’s a few . Social life , love life and career . ”
52831	52839	52840	52840	I	0	“ Jesus , you have it all , ”
52843	52848	52840	52840	I	0	“ You dirty whore . ”
52849	52873	52798	52798	she	101	“ Ha ! Is this a bad time to say that Lukas is texting and wants us to leave now for the Hamptons ? ”
52874	52893	52894	52894	I	0	“ No , it ’s not a bad time , because I ’m thoroughly done talking to you , ”
52908	52923	52894	52894	I	0	“ Go furnish that beautiful beach house of yours , you domestic little thing . ”
52924	52945	52798	52798	she	101	“ Are you sure you do n’t want to come with ? I can tell Lukas to wait till five . ”
52946	52978	53018	53018	she	101	“ Absolutely not . You ’d hit rush hour . Also , I ’d puke out the window within the first two minutes of watching you two googly eye each other . ”
52979	52987	52988	52988	Lia	101	“ We do get pretty gross sometimes , ”
52994	53017	53018	53018	she	101	“ Alright , woman . Then enjoy your Friday and the rest of your weekend without being a Negative Nancy , alright ? ”
53028	53046	53047	53047	She	101	“ No overanalyzing things while I ’m not here to talk it out with you . Just … ”
53058	53063	53047	53047	She	101	“ Enjoy the now . ”
53064	53080	53023	53023	her	101	“ I ’ll enjoy the now even more if you get out of here already . ”
53081	53088	53089	53089	Lia	101	“ Rude . Hug me goodbye ! ”
53192	53204	53205	53205	Colin	130	“ Wow . Weather ’s gon na be nice this weekend , ”
53222	53226	53227	53227	he	130	“ Any plans ? ”
53230	53235	53227	53227	he	130	“ Actually , no , ”
53244	53251	53252	53252	I	0	“ Aw man . Why not ? ”
53255	53293	53294	53294	I	0	“ Probably because I ’m still not used to having weekends . I worked at least six days a week at my last job , and if I had Sundays off , it was strictly for decompressing , ”
53307	53350	53294	53294	I	0	“ Also , now that I actually have some free time , my best friend is the one who ’s always busy . She and her boyfriend just bought a house out in the Hamptons , so they ’re always out there . ”
53351	53357	53358	53358	Colin	130	“ Wow ! Very nice , ”
53367	53385	53358	53358	Colin	130	“ On the bright side , we get to go to sunny Biarritz , France on Monday . ”
53386	53414	53294	53294	I	0	“ Yes ! God , it came up so fast . I really ca n’t wait . I have n’t been out of the country in ages . ”
53415	53442	53294	53294	I	0	“ Well , you ’ll love it there . And Julian ’s pretty cool about giving employees time to explore when they ’re on business trips . ”
53443	53446	53447	53447	I	0	“ Yeah ? ”
53450	53457	53447	53447	I	0	“ That ’s nice of him . ”
53458	53475	53476	53476	I	0	“ Yeah , he ’s a great boss . Ca n’t really beat working for him . ”
53532	53541	53542	53542	Colin	130	“ Alright , Sara , enjoy your weekend ! ”
53554	53558	53559	53559	I	0	“ You too ! ”
53779	53783	53784	53784	Julian	110	“ Hi there , ”
53795	53798	53799	53799	I	0	“ Hi , ”
53882	53888	53889	53889	Julian	110	“ How was your day ? ”
53892	53895	53896	53896	I	0	“ Good , ”
53909	53918	53896	53896	I	0	“ And how was yours , Mr. Hoult ? ”
53919	53924	53925	53925	Julian	110	“ Good as well , ”
53931	53937	53925	53925	Julian	110	“ Glad to hear it , ”
53974	53981	53969	53969	Julian	110	“ Do you have plans tonight ? ”
53989	53994	53995	53995	I	0	“ Not at all , ”
54008	54015	54003	54003	him	110	“ Good . Then get in . ”
54054	54070	54071	54071	she	100	“ Julian … I do n’t even know how to react to this right now , ”
54152	54167	54136	54136	she	100	“ You look like you ’re on your first field trip to the museum . ”
54168	54179	54136	54136	she	100	“ Quiet . You realize this is amazing , right ? ”
54180	54186	54187	54187	I	0	“ I do enjoy it . ”
54202	54238	54187	54187	I	0	“ I also enjoy how you ’ve paid no attention to the cars thus far . They were more of what I had in mind when I asked you to pick our ride for tonight . ”
54239	54245	54246	54246	Sara	100	“ But I want this , ”
54269	54286	54251	54251	her	100	“ Why do we have to take a car ? Look how beautiful this thing is . ”
54287	54319	54320	54320	I	0	“ While you have impeccable taste , that ’s an F131 Hellcat Combat , and it has no passenger seat , so I promise you , we ’re not taking that , ”
54339	54356	54357	54357	she	100	“ Hm . Something tells me you ride motorcycles for the express purpose of being alone , ”
54373	54383	54384	54384	she	100	“ Uh - oh . Look what I found , ”
54412	54420	54403	54403	she	100	“ Looks like we have a winner . ”
54421	54435	54436	54436	She	100	“ Sara . I ’d prefer something with doors . And seat belts . ”
54452	54460	54461	54461	she	100	“ Why ? You ride these things , ”
54465	54471	54461	54461	she	100	“ Yes . I do . ”
54472	54492	54442	54442	she	100	“ Well , if you ’re not worried about your safety , then no need to worry about mine . ”
54493	54503	54504	54504	I	0	“ We ’ve established I have difficulty with this , ”
54537	54542	54543	54543	she	100	“ Oh . Norton , ”
54548	54553	54543	54543	she	100	“ You know it ? ”
54554	54570	54571	54571	she	100	“ Not really . It ’s just my dad had a Norton belt growing up , ”
54580	54591	54571	54571	she	100	“ It had this logo and a little British flag . ”
54592	54598	54543	54543	she	100	“ He had a bike ? ”
54599	54617	54618	54618	I	0	“ Definitely not , but he was British . Still is , as far as I know . ”
54634	54648	54623	54623	her	100	“ Not sure why I did n’t expect your parents to be Brits . ”
54649	54678	54679	54679	she	100	“ They ’re not . Just Dad . Mom is from a tiny , tiny , mountain village that Dad was photographing many years ago during his travels , ”
54716	54723	54724	54724	I	0	“ Was your dad a photographer ? ”
54727	54732	54733	54733	she	100	“ Not at all , ”
54736	54824	54733	54733	she	100	“ He was an eighteen - year - old gap year backpacker when he met my poor , unsuspecting mom . She says she did n’t like him at all the first summer they met . He was loud and excitable and a little overwhelming . But despite how young he was , he said she was ‘ too pretty to just forget , ’ so he kept visiting her summer after summer till she started finding his quirks charming enough to move to London with him . ”
54825	54832	54945	54945	Sara	100	“ That ’s some serious persistency . ”
54833	54879	54733	54733	she	100	“ Yeah , my dad is … whimsical , as he likes to say . He ’s a lawyer who loves his colorful socks and chatting anyone ’s ear off . Says ‘ he ’s never met a stranger . ’ He ’s that guy . ”
54880	54892	54733	54733	she	100	“ Mm . Yeah , I ’m familiar with that guy . ”
54893	54898	54899	54899	Sara	100	“ Oh , yeah , ”
54911	54944	54902	54902	she	100	“ Meanwhile , my mom trusts no one in this world . Except him . You ’ll never see her admit it , because she ’s as ridiculously stoic as you are , ”
54953	54979	54945	54945	Sara	100	“ but she still finds my dad to be so very charming and ‘ unbearably funny , ’ as she says . It ’s cute . ”
54980	54986	54987	54987	I	0	“ Sounds like my parents , ”
54990	54995	54987	54987	I	0	“ Forever in love ? ”
54996	54999	55000	55000	Sara	100	“ Yes . ”
55006	55014	55000	55000	Sara	100	“ That ’s the way to be . ”
55015	55029	54945	54945	Sara	100	“ So I hear . You ’re in heels , by the way . ”
55030	55033	54945	54945	Sara	100	“ What ? ”
55034	55046	55047	55047	She	100	“ You ’re not exactly dressed to ride a motorcycle tonight . ”
55058	55071	55047	55047	She	100	“ Oh . I have a change of shoes in my purse . ”
55072	55075	54945	54945	Sara	100	“ Seriously ? ”
55076	55100	55101	55101	I	0	“ Yes . Any girl in heels who ’s carrying a big purse has flats or sneakers in it . I guarantee you . ”
55105	55118	55101	55101	I	0	“ Your pencil skirt does n’t lend well to mounting a bike . ”
55119	55128	55129	55129	I	0	“ I ’ve mounted you in this skirt . ”
55135	55174	55175	55175	I	0	“ Listen , everything you ’re doing on that bike right now is already going straight to my cock , so for the sake of getting to our plans on time , do n’t talk about mounting me , ”
55186	55201	55178	55178	she	100	“ Tell me why you ’re hell - bent on taking the bike tonight . ”
55202	55223	55224	55224	Sara	100	“ Because you said you ’re choosing where we go , so I get to choose how we get there , ”
55228	55248	55249	55249	she	100	“ And I choose this . Also , I ’ve kind of been obsessed with motorcycles since high school , ”
55253	55257	55249	55249	she	100	“ Also unexpected . ”
55258	55273	55274	55274	she	100	“ Yeah , well , I fantasized in great detail about escaping that place , ”
55295	55300	55290	55290	I	0	“ Escaping what place ? ”
55306	55323	55324	55324	she	100	“ Save for speedboats , motorcycles are also the coolest form of getaway in heist movies , ”
55333	55370	55324	55324	she	100	“ So , a hundred percent , we ’re taking this bike . And if you ’re concerned about it being my first ride , it ’s not . So , done . It ’s decided . ”
55378	55443	55444	55444	Sara	100	“ Fine . But you ’re wearing a helmet , and I ’m going to teach you the proper way to mount and ride as a passenger . Most importantly , when I lean , you lean . Do n’t try to balance me by going the opposite way . Even if you feel like we ’re about to fall , which you will . ”
55451	55462	55463	55463	she	100	“ Are you trying to scare me out of this ? ”
55469	55478	55463	55463	she	100	“ Somewhat . Last chance to back out . ”
55479	55482	55483	55483	she	100	“ Never , ”
55487	55498	55483	55483	she	100	“ You do n’t even know where we ’re going , ”
55513	55520	55505	55505	she	100	“ What difference does that make ? ”
56450	56454	56436	56436	he	107	“ Good Lord , ”
56501	56510	56511	56516	one of the sun hat ladies	1008	“ Oh , honey , is he yours ? ”
56527	56542	56543	56543	she	1008	“ Oh , yes , you match too well not to be with him , ”
56546	56556	56557	56557	I	0	“ Yes , I guess he is mine today , ”
56580	56602	56603	56603	she	1008	“ Ah , ah – just today ? Oh , no , no , dear . That is not the attitude , ”
56655	56658	56659	56659	He	107	“ Hey . ”
56699	56705	56694	56694	he	107	“ How does it feel ? ”
56724	56730	56731	56731	I	0	“ You mean the ride ? ”
56744	56754	56731	56731	I	0	“ It ’s good . Not bad at all . ”
56755	56765	56766	56766	I	0	“ When else have you been on a motorcycle ? ”
56776	56784	56785	56785	I	0	“ With my best friend in college , ”
56821	56827	56828	56828	I	0	“ Should we get going ? ”
56884	56888	56889	56889	he	107	“ Good girl , ”
56978	56981	56982	56982	I	0	“ Ridiculous , ”
56992	56996	56997	56997	he	107	“ I agree , ”
57103	57112	57113	57113	Lia	101	“ Oh my God ! I knew it ! ”
57130	57141	57142	57142	she	101	“ Hi , hi , hi , hi , hi ! ”
57183	57188	57189	57189	I	0	“ Hey , crazy , ”
57209	57227	57198	57198	She	101	“ You ! You could ’ve told Lukas you were bringing her so I had some warning ! ”
57228	57234	57235	57235	Julian	107	“ I did tell Lukas , ”
57253	57256	57248	57248	she	101	“ Lukas ! ”
57297	57318	57287	57287	he	107	“ It ’s hard to believe stories that she was ever anything resembling a calm or mild - mannered person . ”
57324	57333	57287	57287	he	107	“ She really was pretty reserved for awhile . ”
57334	57341	57287	57287	he	107	“ I ca n’t imagine it . ”
57342	57346	57347	57347	I	0	“ I swear , ”
57361	57398	57352	57352	Julian	107	“ She ’s from a small , shitty town like me , and that place did a number on her for awhile , so I think when Lukas came around , that was the turning point . ”
57399	57409	57410	57410	Julian	107	“ You ’re from a small , shitty town ? ”
57416	57419	57410	57410	Julian	107	“ Where ? ”
57454	57482	57449	57449	I	0	“ You know , it ’s every bit like you to weed out anything I say about Lia , and just listen to the part about me . ”
57483	57500	57501	57501	I	0	“ Yes . I do n’t like her . I like you . Is that surprising ? ”
57516	57576	57513	57513	he	107	“ Do n’t you dare say you do n’t like my best friend , Julian . I mean it . Especially when I know you do like her as a human being . If you ’re Lukas ’s friend , you have to . It ’s not like she did n’t do worlds of good for him , too . ”
57577	57580	57644	57644	his	107	“ Fair . ”
57581	57589	57644	57644	his	107	“ Say one nice thing about Lia . ”
57590	57605	57513	57513	he	107	“ She has the good sense to associate with people like Lukas and yourself . ”
57606	57612	57613	57613	I	0	“ That does n’t count ! ”
57650	57663	57664	57664	he	107	“ I like how you look when you get defensive of her , ”
57671	57677	57664	57664	he	107	“ Still does n’t count , ”
57746	57755	57740	57740	I	0	“ Oh shit ! Look who it is ! ”
58095	58107	58086	58086	he	1033	“ Nice to meet you . Julian has spoken about you . ”
58117	58120	58110	58110	his	1033	“ What ? ”
58132	58142	58122	58122	Julian	107	“ What ? I did n’t say anything weird ! ”
58188	58196	58197	58197	Julian	107	“ You guys have a nice introduction ? ”
58216	58235	58236	58236	Emmett	113	“ We had a perfectly normal introduction , during which I revealed no more information than was necessary , ”
58253	58270	58241	58241	He	113	“ Sometimes I talk like him so he ’ll understand what the hell I ’m saying . ”
58271	58281	58282	58282	Julian	107	“ I still do n’t understand him for shit , ”
58380	58395	58396	58396	she	101	“ Oh my God , he ’s being so un - Julian right now , ”
58407	58416	58396	58396	she	101	“ He ’s definitely being … super cute . ”
58417	58458	58459	58459	I	0	“ And that is definitely the first time ‘ cute ’ has ever been used to describe Julian Hoult . Pretty sure even when he was a baby , his mom called him ‘ handsome ’ and ‘ efficient . ’ ”
58493	58512	58513	58513	Lia	101	“ Like that . That just now ? You guys are acting like a couple or some shit , ”
58516	58540	58513	58513	Lia	101	“ Sara , I swear to God , I am presently overwhelmed with the possibilities of our summer if you start dating Julian . ”
58541	58551	58552	58552	I	0	“ Oh my God , will you cool it ? ”
58555	58568	58552	58552	I	0	“ Can I take this a day at a time , please ? ”
58569	58602	58513	58513	Lia	101	“ That ’s what normal people who practice caution say . You ’re not that person anymore . You just did two hours on the road as your first motorcycle ride ever . ”
58603	58623	58552	58552	I	0	“ To be fair , I ’ve ridden the back of a motorcycle around an empty parking lot before . ”
58624	58630	58631	58631	Lia	101	“ Yeah . Totally comparable , ”
58681	58688	58689	58689	I	0	“ Sorry , what ’s happening ? ”
58706	58733	58734	58734	he	113	“ I was just saying how I invested in this place because I did post - prom in Southampton after high school , and these assholes , ”
58741	58764	58734	58734	he	113	“ are telling me post - prom in the Hamptons is ridiculous , so I wanna know what everyone did for theirs . ”
58765	58770	58771	58771	I	0	“ Post - prom ? ”
58791	58798	58780	58780	I	0	“ Um , in my town … ”
58808	58845	58801	58801	My	0	“ People went to party venues for the ‘ after prom party , ’ and it was adult supervised , but I know that they were able to still get away with bringing alcohol and stuff . ”
58846	58857	58877	58877	She	164	“ You do n’t sound like you went to it , ”
58894	58902	58903	58903	I	0	“ Yeah , I did n’t go , ”
58906	58910	58903	58903	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
58911	58914	58917	58919	The entire circle	1037	“ Um . ”
58987	58996	58997	58997	I	0	“ I graduated high school a year early , ”
59022	59044	59045	59045	she	164	“ So you were a little younger your senior year . That does n’t mean you ’re not allowed at prom , ”
59065	59071	59050	59050	her	164	“ Yeah , I just … ”
59092	59110	59111	59111	Julian	110	“ Emmett , why do n’t you tell everyone about the fire you started at your prom ? ”
59127	59138	59139	59140	some guy	1038	“ You started a fire at your prom , E ? ”
59143	59148	59149	59149	Julian	110	“ You ’re surprised ? ”
59152	59159	59149	59149	Julian	110	“ I for one am not , ”
59163	59174	59160	59160	Lukas	102	“ But I definitely need to hear the story now . ”
59251	59259	59245	59245	Pixie	164	“ Lia , who is that woman ? ”
59284	59297	59267	59267	I	0	“ The one in the green who grilled me about my prom . ”
59298	59344	59366	59366	Lia	101	“ I do n’t know , but trust me , I was asking Lukas the same question after she pulled that I’m - so - curious shit . Like , could n’t she see that you did n’t want to talk about it ? Jesus . ”
59345	59358	59359	59359	I	0	“ What did Lukas say ? Does he know who she is ? ”
59362	59365	59359	59359	I	0	“ No . ”
59373	59401	59366	59366	Lia	101	“ I swear there ’s so much even he does n’t know about Julian , and he ’s by far the closest to Julian outside of family . ”
59469	59476	59477	59477	I	0	“ So , Emmett ’s funny , ”
59484	59491	59492	59492	Lia	101	“ Yeah , he ’s crazy , ”
59495	59519	59492	59492	Lia	101	“ And a party animal . Give him another few hours , he ’ll turn this kumbaya into a full - on rager . ”
59520	59529	59530	59530	I	0	“ Oh God . Looking forward to it , ”
59544	59550	59551	59551	Lia	101	“ Oh , come on , ”
59587	59620	59582	59582	she	101	“ It ’s okay . No biggie . That ’s probably fair game when people leave their seats for the bathroom . It is n’t war unless they refuse to get up . ”
59630	59633	59634	59634	she	101	“ Oh , ”
59660	59687	59688	59688	she	101	“ Can we exchange for a bit ? I just need to catch up with this man . It ’s been way , way too long , ”
59724	59730	59731	59731	he	110	“ Sara , come here , ”
59750	59755	59756	59756	Lia	101	“ Oh my God , ”
59843	59847	59838	59838	he	110	“ Stop that . ”
59848	59852	59853	59853	I	0	“ Stop what ? ”
59857	59888	59838	59838	he	110	“ Clenching your pussy . I can feel it on my thighs , and I ’d rather not get any harder than I currently am in front of these people . ”
59918	59926	59927	59927	she	164	“ So , you rode pillion today , ”
59930	59933	59934	59934	I	0	“ Pillion ? ”
59952	59961	59946	59946	her	164	“ That means the passenger seat , sweetie . ”
59978	59980	59973	59973	her	164	“ sweetie ”
59993	60009	60010	60010	I	0	“ Oh . Well , in that case , yes . I did ride pillion , ”
60022	60040	60041	60041	Pixie	164	“ I ’m a bit surprised you would take someone inexperienced for a two - hour ride , ”
60046	60056	60041	60041	Pixie	164	“ You ’re usually so big on following rules . ”
60057	60062	60063	60063	Julian	110	“ Yes , well . ”
60083	60090	60065	60065	his	110	“ She can be very persuasive . ”
60142	60149	60150	60150	Emmett	113	“ What ’s up , Giggles ? ”
60153	60176	60183	60183	she	101	“ Oh , nothing . I just overheard Julian calling Sara ‘ very persuasive , ’ and I just had to agree . ”
60196	60232	60183	60183	she	101	“ She is unrivaled when it comes to making people do things . Right , Lukas ? Let ’s not forget that this bad bitch over here is the reason you and I got together . ”
60244	60254	60255	60255	he	102	“ I do owe you a big thank you , ”
60258	60290	60291	60291	he	102	“ Thank you for meddling when I was courting this woman . You are the best , and any uptight billionaire assholes in this vicinity would be lucky to have you , ”
60313	60331	60332	60332	she	101	“ Did everyone hear that ? Sara is the best , so do n’t fuck with her , ”
60351	60360	60361	60361	Emmett	113	“ Yeah , she ’s fuckin ’ Superwoman , ”
60365	60383	60361	60361	Emmett	113	“ Pretty sure no one else could ’ve trapped those Roth assholes as fast as you did . ”
60402	60405	60406	60406	Julian	110	“ Emmett , ”
60736	60747	60748	60748	Pixie	164	“ So , wait , I do n’t get it . ”
60757	60768	60748	60748	Pixie	164	“ You ’re like … an escort for these men ? ”
60784	60790	60791	60791	She	164	“ Wow , that ’s … ”
60803	60806	60791	60791	She	164	“ Yikes . ”
60888	60891	60867	60867	Lukas	102	“ Sara . ”
60892	60902	60903	60903	I	0	“ I do n’t want to talk to you , ”
60909	60913	60903	60903	I	0	“ Or anyone . ”
60914	60933	60934	60934	he	110	“ My brother is a fucking idiot , Sara , I ’m sorry . I ’m so sorry , ”
60961	60969	60954	60954	I	0	“ Please let me talk to you . ”
60970	60987	60988	60988	I	0	“ I do n’t want to be here right now , Julian , I feel disgusting , ”
60991	61016	60988	60988	I	0	“ I feel so dirty and disgusting right now . Those guys – they were looking at me like I was some kind of … ”
61233	61243	61244	61244	Julian	110	“ Come on . You ’re coming with me . ”
61488	61496	61497	61497	Sara	100	“ You really need to know this ? ”
61570	61576	61577	61577	I	0	“ I need to know , ”
61600	61634	61577	61577	I	0	“ I do n’t enjoy feeling like I ca n’t protect you . The more you tell me , the better I know how to keep someone from hurting you . So talk . ”
61635	61648	61649	61649	she	100	“ You first . Who was that woman in the green dress ? ”
61657	61667	61649	61649	she	100	“ She seemed a bit possessive of your attention . ”
61668	61673	61674	61674	I	0	“ That was Madeline , ”
61677	61711	61674	61674	I	0	“ I met her five years ago while I was out with Emmett one night . I do n’t know where he found her . He generally collects new friends throughout the night . ”
61712	61720	61721	61721	she	100	“ And you two have slept together ? ”
61724	61727	61728	61728	I	0	“ Twice , ”
61731	61788	61728	61728	I	0	“ She ’s just a woman I ’ve slept with before , Sara . Your issue with her should be solely with the fact that she crossed the line in conversation today . You have no reason to feel threatened by any woman I ’ve had a history with , no matter how long or brief . ”
61789	61797	61798	61798	Sara	100	“ No ? Tell me why not , ”
61828	61848	61818	61818	I	0	“ I care about you more than I ’ve ever cared about another woman . That ’s your answer . ”
61849	61856	61857	61857	she	100	“ That ’s hard to believe , ”
61881	61884	61885	61885	I	0	“ Why ? ”
61888	61903	61885	61885	I	0	“ What reason have I given you to doubt that I care for you ? ”
61904	61907	61908	61908	she	100	“ None , ”
61912	61928	61929	61929	she	100	“ I just do n’t know you . I do n’t know anything about you , ”
61946	62029	61929	61929	she	100	“ I ’m obviously feeling things for you . You do n’t make it easy for me to avoid that , but I want to keep myself at least a little protected from you . Explaining my past to you is just me volunteering to knock down whatever ’s left of my wall , and I do n’t know if that ’s worth it for you , Julian . Not when this little thing here will be done before I know it . ”
62051	62060	62061	62061	I	0	“ What the hell are you talking about ? ”
62072	62096	62097	62097	she	100	“ Are you really going to pretend whatever ’s going on between us is something you ’re willing to invest your time in ? ”
62100	62206	62097	62097	she	100	“ Look at you . Look at who you are . You do n’t do this kind of thing . You do n’t have girlfriends . There ’s a good portion of your life you have n’t revealed to your own best friend . You ’re guarded , and I get it . It ’s the best way to get work done . We ’ve both employed that method of living . We both know what it ’s like , so why are you asking me to expose myself for you when you ’d never do the same for anyone else , let alone me ? ”
62262	62281	62257	62257	I	0	“ I ’ll tell you whatever you want to know about me if you tell me about you . ”
62300	62319	62320	62320	she	1076	“ You wo n’t want to look at me let alone talk to me after I ’m done , ”
62343	62370	62371	62371	I	0	“ You know that is n’t true . I ca n’t stop looking at you . That ’s been the problem since the night we met . ”
62383	62463	62464	62464	she	1076	“ Fine . If you ’re so convinced of that , let me go right ahead . I stayed at June Magazine for almost ten years , despite how they treated me , because I was convinced no other company would ever hire me . My mom was convinced June neglected my background check because I was hired directly out of my internship . I was arrested in college , Julian . Can you guess what the charges were ? ”
62487	62499	62500	62500	she	1076	“ It was prostitution . Would you like to run now ? ”
62662	62667	62668	62668	I	0	“ Look at me , ”
62719	62803	62708	62708	I	0	“ Look at me , Sara . You see me . You know I ’m not going anywhere . I ’m right here , and all I want is to know that I can fix the way you feel . I ca n’t stand it when you ’re unhappy , and I ’m going to have you smiling by the end of this night , I promise you that . I just need you to talk to me first , Sara . Please . ”
62851	62865	62845	62845	she	1078	“ The scar I have ... you know what I ’m talking about . ”
62866	62877	62878	62878	I	0	“ The one Turner mentioned the night at the pool , ”
62881	62900	62878	62878	I	0	“ That one . You saw it when you were helping me come down from my panic attack . ”
62901	62904	62845	62845	she	1078	“ Yes . ”
62905	62943	62944	62944	I	0	“ I usually have it covered with makeup . It ’s in the shape of an ‘ F ’ because the girls at school wanted to burn the word ‘ freak ’ on me with their cigarettes . ”
63023	63028	63029	63029	I	0	“ You were bullied ? ”
63032	63043	63044	63044	she	1079	“ From the start . But what did I expect , ”
63054	63189	63044	63044	she	1079	“ My dad … he moved us to Texas on a whim . After his mom died , he wanted to leave London , and he picked this little town where one of his travel buddies from forever ago lived . I was already different when we got there – I looked different . I talked different . My dad had an accent , my mom was too nervous to speak to other moms . I was an easy target . But it got so much worse when my dad decided to represent his friend in an assault case . Some bar fight . The defendant was popular around town – he was the high school football coach , and he had a kid in my grade . Also well liked . Also popular . ”
63199	63222	63190	63190	She	1080	“ So everyone made my life miserable from that point on . And it got that much worse after my dad won . ”
63254	63258	63259	63259	I	0	“ Go on , ”
63292	63305	63306	63306	she	1080	“ It took a couple days for them to finish the F , ”
63309	63372	63306	63306	she	1080	“ The girls would corner me in the bathroom . One time , they even snuck some boys in to keep me restrained while they burned me . I remembered crying , but I did n’t make a sound because I felt like that was validation for them . I was just thinking of how to get myself out of the place . ”
63378	63520	63373	63373	She	1080	“ I fantasized about getaways a lot . That ’s where the motorcycle thing came in . But that was n’t realistic , obviously , so I just worked to graduate early and start completely anew in college . I already knew where I wanted to go that we could afford , and I knew what sorority I wanted to join . I knew how I would dress and act so I did n’t seem different again , like an outcast again . I had dreamt of going to prom since I was a little girl , and wearing that big , poufy dress . But since that clearly was n’t going to happen , I told myself I ’d go to frat parties , and mixers , and I ’d have that perfect all - American teen life in college . ”
63521	63525	63526	63526	I	0	“ Did you ? ”
63559	63576	63551	63551	she	1082	“ You said you rode the back of a motorcycle with your best friend in college . ”
63577	63580	63581	63581	Sara	100	“ Ashleigh , ”
63596	63769	63770	63770	I	0	“ Ash is what we called her . She was my big . I got into the sorority I wanted , I got all the friends I wanted , and I got her as my big sister , which seemed like winning the jackpot at the time . She was this insanely popular , Barbie - like girl who everyone adored on campus , and the fact that she took me under her wing was like a dream . We were inseparable from the second we met , and suddenly , just a summer after all that torture in high school , I had everything I ever wanted . I had this built in family with my sisters , and I had this girl who would drive me around , take me out , be a shoulder to cry on . I was seventeen , and she was like a god to me . She had me wrapped around her pinky so hard I did n’t question anything she asked of me . ”
63807	63815	63796	63796	I	0	“ What did she ask of you ? ”
63816	63821	63822	63822	She	100	“ She had me … ”
63828	63835	63836	63836	she	100	“ She had me perform favors , ”
63851	63958	63836	63836	she	100	“ For guys in the frat we were paired with . I knew I did n’t feel right , but I did n’t really understand what was happening . I was so desperate to believe these girls were my friends . I did n’t have coffee dates , or sleepovers , or parties back in high school , and I had all of that with these girls . They helped me study , they met me after class , they defended me to the death if anyone was even a little rude to me at a party . So I was so confused . I was … ”
63968	63973	63961	63961	her	100	“ So fucking stupid . ”
63974	63979	63980	63980	I	0	“ You were seventeen , ”
63987	64031	63980	63980	I	0	“ The kids in high school , they were blatant villains . You knew to run from them . But these girls were different . They acted like friends to play into your vulnerability , and what they did to you was heinous . ”
64032	64041	64042	64042	Sara	100	“ That was n’t even the worst part , ”
64051	64130	64042	64042	Sara	100	“ Ash convinced me she needed money . Something about her family being in trouble . She reminded me of all the times she drove me , or paid for me , or did whatever for me . And she guilted me into saying yes to something disgusting , because she said I ’d be screwed if I did n’t do it . That college could be as bad as it was in high school . Worse maybe . ”
64150	64159	64160	64160	I	0	“ It ’s okay . Take your time , ”
64181	64261	64164	64164	she	100	“ They found someone – some man who would pay a lot of money to sleep with me . They told me he was one of our friend ’s older cousins , but when I got to the motel , the man was so much older , and from somewhere else . He said he found Ash online . I remember feeling so betrayed , and I remember how annoyed he got that I cried in front of him . ”
64311	64329	64303	64303	she	1084	“ I need you to know that I did n’t have sex with that man . Okay ? ”
64330	64333	64334	64334	I	0	“ Okay , ”
64337	64344	64334	64334	I	0	“ It ’s okay , Sara . ”
64345	64467	64303	64303	she	1084	“ One of my sisters called the cops . I told her before we left about what Ash and the other older girls were asking me to do , and I begged her to call the cops . I did n’t think she would , but she did . I felt so disgusting for being naked when they found me . I had already tried touching that man . It honestly felt like the cops came at the last possible second . But I thank God for them anyway , and I thank God for the girl who called them for me . I was n’t even mad at her for being like everyone else and ignoring me after the incident . ”
64468	64475	64303	64303	she	1084	“ Because you called the cops ? ”
64476	64653	64680	64680	her	1086	“ Yes . Ash and the girls were arrested . Their names were in the paper , and mine got taken out when they realized I was a minor . They dropped the charges on me when they realized what was happening , and the kids at school thought that was unfair . They blamed me for everything – said I was asking for it with the way I dressed , the way I wore makeup . They had already saved the article that came out with my name in it . It ’s still archived online . I tried to have it taken down , but someone put it back up , even after I transferred thousands of miles away . And it just feels like this nagging reminder that I was once this … little thing that existed solely for sex . It makes me feel dirty and disgusting and guilty for wanting sex . Especially the way that I want it . A part of me feels like I should be repenting still . ”
64654	64670	64671	64671	I	0	“ Do you feel guilty about what we ’ve done in the past few weeks ? ”
64718	64721	64722	64722	she	1086	“ No , ”
64760	64863	64747	64747	her	1086	“ All I feel is good around you . I feel like I ’m doing something a little wilder and crazier than I ’m used to , but I do n’t ever feel bad about it . Not with you . I do n’t feel guilty about anything between us , and it makes me feel like I ’m actually free around you . Like I ’m really acting like myself instead of the girl I forced myself to be . I was just trying to make it up to myself and my parents for what I did when I was seventeen . ”
64864	64908	64747	64747	her	1086	“ That was ten years ago , Sara . It was n’t your fault , nor should you feel guilty about what you want . You ’re not defined by what those girls did to you . You ca n’t keep blaming yourself . ”
64909	64922	64923	64923	she	1089	“ I pushed it to the back of my head for awhile , ”
64927	65003	64923	64923	she	1089	“ I did n’t even think about it much while I was at June Magazine . I was so overworked , but I think I liked it . I was always exhausted , too busy to do too much drinking , definitely no dating , and it made me feel like I had successfully transformed into someone new . Someone not filthy and reckless . My mother was proud of me . Everything seemed okay . ”
65004	65009	64747	64747	her	1086	“ Until you quit . ”
65010	65013	65014	65014	Her	1089	“ Yes . ”
65028	65095	65096	65096	She	1089	“ I took your job offer because I wanted to be near you . I ’m not even going to lie about it at this point . But since I ’ve started , I ’ve felt just … better about myself . Like I ’m allowed to enjoy the things I used to feel guilty about , and like I ’m the one in control now . ”
65125	65133	65134	65134	she	1089	“ You make me feel … happy , ”
65140	65151	65152	65152	she	1089	“ Like I ’ve never felt before in my life , ”
65164	65212	65157	65157	she	1089	“ And I know that ’s a lot for you to hear right now , so you do n’t have to say anything . Just nod or say one word to acknowledge you heard it , and we ’ll move on . Just say ‘ okay . ’ ”
65213	65220	65221	65221	I	0	“ How about ‘ same ’ ? ”
65231	65237	65224	65224	she	1089	“ I feel the same . ”
65251	65262	65263	65263	I	0	“ But I want to make sure you stay happy , ”
65271	65290	65263	65263	I	0	“ I ’m not going to let anyone hurt you again . I promise you that . Okay ? ”
65304	65307	65291	65291	She	1089	“ Okay . ”
66074	66089	66055	66055	Julian	110	“ I care about you more than I ’ve ever cared about another woman . ”
66183	66186	66187	66187	Julian	110	“ Morning . ”
66235	66238	66239	66239	I	0	“ Morning , ”
66258	66267	66268	66268	I	0	“ I thought it was for work purposes , ”
66275	66283	66268	66268	I	0	“ I did n’t realize it was … ”
66284	66287	66288	66288	Julian	110	“ What ? ”
66292	66306	66307	66307	he	110	“ What is it that you think you ’re looking at right now ? ”
66313	66321	66310	66310	I	0	“ Remnants of a very passionate affair . ”
66322	66325	66326	66326	He	110	“ No . ”
66332	66342	66326	66326	He	110	“ For the most part , you ’re wrong . ”
66343	66349	66350	66350	My	0	“ For the most part ? ”
66380	66390	66391	66391	I	0	“ Will you tell me the story behind it ? ”
66415	66418	66419	66419	he	110	“ Yes , ”
66422	66434	66419	66419	he	110	“ But we ’re going to need to get breakfast first . ”
66518	66547	66548	66548	I	0	“ If this is your way of keeping me distracted while you confess your secrets , I do n’t appreciate it , because it ’s kind of working , ”
66622	66625	66626	66626	He	110	“ Actually . ”
66639	66650	66626	66626	He	110	“ The boat is for the purpose of distracting me . ”
66651	66654	66626	66626	He	110	“ Oh . ”
66724	66734	66735	66735	I	0	“ How ’d you learn to drive a boat ? ”
66753	66759	66735	66735	I	0	“ My grandfather taught me . ”
66799	66805	66806	66806	I	0	“ Your mother ’s father ? ”
66809	66859	66806	66806	I	0	“ My father ’s father . He taught me how to steer a boat , how to line a fishing rod – he also taught all eight grandkids how to use our chest voices when heckling opposing outfielders . So we ’d be loud enough to actually distract them . ”
66898	66905	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Your grandfather sounds like fun . "
66906	66923	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ He was . He was also ‘ that guy . ’ Similar to your dad . ”
66934	66996	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Yeah , he was loud and happy and animated . He asked my grandmother on a date about two minutes after he first spotted her at the stadium , and when he took her out that night , he told her he was going to marry her , have three kids with her , and buy the Empires for her . ”
66997	67002	67003	67003	I	0	“ And he did ? ”
67006	67014	67003	67003	I	0	“ I mean the three kids part . ”
67015	67072	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Yes . That he got right . Same with the marriage part , obviously . He was a lower - middle class kid from Brooklyn , but he wound up making most of his money through property rentals , and he did try to buy the Empires twice before , but his bids were rejected . ”
67073	67092	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Oh no . Was your grandma holding him to the whole thing about buying her the team ? ”
67093	67130	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Not at all . She teased him every day about how she did n’t believe he ’d ever be able to do it , and that he was batting six sixty - seven on promises . ”
67131	67139	67140	67140	I	0	“ Lord . Such a baseball family , ”
67143	67158	67140	67140	I	0	“ They sound too cute . Is your dad also ‘ that guy ? ’ ”
67159	67170	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ No , my dad would be more like me . ”
67171	67176	67177	67177	Julian	110	“ Serious and scary ? ”
67180	67197	67177	67177	Julian	110	“ Yes , but less scary . A little nicer . No – a lot nicer . ”
67198	67206	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Really ? Tell me about him . ”
67207	67275	66924	66924	Julian	110	“ Well , he did inherit some of my grandfather ’s romantic side . To the point that I grew up thinking all kids celebrated Mother ’s Day with the same fanfare as Thanksgiving and Christmas . We used to spend the entire month before the day planning her surprise . We would get all her favorite foods , decorate the entire house with her favorite flowers . ”
67276	67280	67177	67177	Julian	110	“ Which were ? ”
67281	67285	67286	67286	Julian	110	“ Ranunculus flowers , ”
67298	67309	67286	67286	Julian	110	“ The name is misleading . They ’re really beautiful . ”
67318	67326	67310	67310	I	0	“ Huh . Julian Hoult likes flowers ? ”
67327	67347	67348	67348	he	110	“ Hard not to with the way I grew up . Every April of my life revolved around flowers , ”
67351	67411	67348	67348	he	110	“ Dahlias were also high on the list . Hydrangeas , too . Mom liked all the harder to find colors , so Emmett and I usually started ordering a month before Mother ’s Day . Dad was in charge of planning and executing the menu for the night , and Emmett and I were on ordering and décor . ”
67412	67422	67310	67310	I	0	“ And by Emmett and you , you mean … ”
67423	67427	67428	67428	Julian	110	“ Just me , ”
67439	67488	67431	67431	his	110	“ There were these big , chocolate - covered strawberries that were Mom ’s favorite , and timing that order so they stayed fresh would always cause Emmett to melt down . There was always a point where he got overwhelmed and meditated by coloring and making cards . ”
67489	67497	67498	67498	I	0	“ Oh , no ! Poor Emmett . ”
67545	67561	67431	67431	his	110	“ So , is this where Julian Hoult ’s famous organizing and planning skills originated ? ”
67562	67623	67498	67498	I	0	“ Possibly . Though my father did start me on business classes around middle school . He said all my grandfather ’s real estate was purchased on a whim , when property was cheap , so it was unreasonable to believe that his kind of success would just replicate or fall in our laps . We had to earn it . ”
67624	67638	67639	67639	I	0	“ Ah . Now I see how you and Dad are more alike , ”
67669	67679	67498	67498	I	0	“ I take it Emmett ’s more like Mom ? ”
67680	67718	67498	67498	I	0	“ No , my mom is a good balance of fun and serious . Emmett would be more like my crazy grandfather . Not a surprise at all that he was always my grandparents ’ favorite grandchild . ”
67719	67727	67498	67498	I	0	“ Really ? It was n’t you ? ”
67728	67735	67736	67736	Julian	110	“ I was a close second , ”
67739	67766	67736	67736	Julian	110	“ I was a bit fickle . I was n’t easy to amuse at all , and that just kills the fun of playing with kids . ”
67818	67828	67805	67805	he	110	“ So Emmett was the happy , smiley kid . ”
67829	67834	67835	67835	Julian	110	“ Shocking , right ? ”
67842	67923	67835	67835	Julian	110	“ I ’ll admit he was hilariously cute as a kid . Pretty much never stopped smiling – thought anything you said or did was fucking amazing . My grandpa used to bring him around the bleachers when Emmett was a toddler , and he ’d just introduce him to complete strangers . He just thought there was no chance someone at an Empires game would prefer to actually watch the game than meet this ‘ fine young gentleman . ’ ”
67924	67935	67936	67936	I	0	“ Oh , God . That ’s actually too cute . ”
67979	68015	67968	67968	he	110	“ Meanwhile , my grandmother was glued to the game . She loved her grandkids , but if there was baseball going on , she was n’t taking her eyes off the field for anything . ”
68016	68049	68050	68050	I	0	“ So , she came here from Germany , went straight to a game to get a feel of Americana , and then became the most hardcore baseball fan in your family ? ”
68056	68059	68060	68060	Julian	110	“ Absolutely , ”
68072	68144	68067	68068	The man	2041	“ She likes to pull my President of Baseball Operations aside every once in awhile , and give her some pointers on who to sign during free agency . She ’s almost ninety now , but still keeps a mental Rolodex of player contracts and salaries throughout the league , just to think of possible trade scenarios . The players think she ’s terrifying . They call her Rosemarie The Reaper . ”
68145	68150	68151	68151	I	0	“ Oh my God . ”
68175	68190	68151	68151	I	0	“ Are you sure it ’s not your grandma you take after , Julian ? ”
68191	68208	68209	68209	Julian	110	“ You know , it ’s got ta be a mix of both her and Dad , ”
68216	68231	68209	68209	Julian	110	“ I ’m a reflection of them . Emmett ’s a reflection of Grandpa . ”
68232	68256	68151	68151	I	0	“ In that case , your entire family had to be your grandparents ’ favorites . There ’s no way they were n’t . ”
68257	68276	68277	68277	I	0	“ Oh , we were . And we still are . Though for different reasons now , probably . ”
68332	68468	68322	68322	Julian	110	“ I was twenty - three when my grandpa ’s cancer spread to his bones . I remember me and Emmett and my parents spending a lot of time in hospice with him and Grandma . We would just play cards , or talk , or watch the game , but it was good . It felt like we were taking our time to say goodbye , and we were leaving off on some laughter and good conversation . We took the time to make new memories instead of just talking about the old ones . Though we did that too . It was just a nice , peaceful time , all things considered . Both my grandparents accepted what was happening , and for the most part , they were at peace with it . “
68513	68514	68493	68493	They	1130	” “
68519	68574	68493	68493	They	1130	” I whispered . I had only heard about these family battles over wills and money . I did n’t have a big enough family myself to see it happen , and I really could n’t process that things could ever get so ugly among blood – especially over something as trivial as money . “
68584	68652	68577	68577	they	1133	” Julian said evenly . There he goes . I could always tell when a topic upset Julian . He always carefully extracted any and all emotion from his voice , carrying on with a calm that was strictly uninterpretable . The only tell was in his eyes , but today , he had those covered . In that sense , shades were like his superhero cape . “
68663	68667	68668	68668	He	1925	” Julian said . “
68867	68868	68858	68860	a new asshole	1151	” “
68880	68907	68874	68874	they	1153	” I argued , my own voice shaking with the fury I felt over Julian ’s asshole cousin forcing his grandfather to cry on his deathbed . “
68924	68946	68947	68947	I	0	” I cut off because I did n’t want to say it . Julian gripped the wheel of the boat tight . “
69032	69103	69019	69019	He	2217	” I hugged my knees tight against my chest . I knew where this story was going , and I could n’t take it . My heart was twisting and turning as I waited for Julian to just say it , but obviously , he needed time . For awhile , it was just the silence and the sound of the motor as the yacht continued sailing toward the skyline . “
69119	69197	69113	69113	my	0	” Julian finally said , and with the kind of strained smile I knew was for the purpose of bracing your emotions . Inching closer to him , I dared to reach for his hand . Before I could tell myself to pull back and give him some space , he took my hand in his . I stared down at our fingers entwined , a little amazed by the notion of my touch providing him comfort . “
69203	69208	69200	69200	you	0	” I asked softly . “
69213	69217	69200	69200	you	0	” he said . “
69277	69282	69269	69269	I	0	“ Your grandfather passed ? ”
69307	69310	69311	69311	he	0	“ No , ”
69314	69332	69311	69311	he	0	“ It was my dad . He had a massive heart attack an hour after I left . ”
69527	69560	69561	69561	he	110	“ She ’s apologized profusely since , but she blamed me then . She said I drove my father to that point . And I did . You ca n’t deny that , ”
69572	69578	69579	69579	he	110	“ You really ca n’t , ”
69591	69648	69579	69579	he	110	“ I shocked him , and I angered him so badly it killed him . I did n’t get to say goodbye to him . We just left off . It still feels like we ’re up in the air , and wherever he is , he ’s always wishing he could say something to me . ”
69712	69725	69726	69726	I	0	“ You have to know he ’s proud of you , Julian , ”
69729	69847	69726	69726	I	0	“ How could he be anything but that ? You put his early business lessons to work , you founded your company – you even followed through on your grandfather ’s promise to buy the New York Empires . That ’s crazy , Julian . You and the people around you might be used to your success and achievements at this point , but as an outside party , let me tell you that I am constantly in awe of you . You are unstoppable , and considering the unreal accomplishments you ’ve had so far , I ca n’t imagine a greater honor than being the motivation for your success , the way your family is . ”
69864	69881	69882	69882	I	0	“ You told me yesterday to stop blaming myself and trying to repent for the past , ”
69887	69943	69944	69944	I	0	“ so I ’m telling you now to allow the same for yourself . A part of you has to know you deserve it . You gave your grandmother the opportunity to be Rosie The Reaper to a bunch of big pro ballers . Your grandfather is definitely somewhere laughing with your dad about that , ”
69959	69967	69944	69944	I	0	“ They ’re definitely pleased about that . ”
69968	69971	69972	69972	Julian	110	“ Exactly . ”
69992	70000	70001	70001	he	110	“ My guilt does n’t end there , ”
70014	70019	70001	70001	he	110	“ What else happened ? ”
70020	70032	70033	70033	I	0	“ I was estranged for years from my mother and Emmett . ”
70076	70166	70001	70001	he	110	“ I went home for my father and grandfather ’s funerals , but I moved overseas shortly after . Just weeks after . There was a sudden wall between me and the rest of my family . My mom could n’t look at me . She did n’t want to . Emmett claimed it was because I reminded her too much of our father , and not because she blamed me for his death , but I knew that was a lie . So , I moved to Stockholm . ”
70167	70174	70175	70175	I	0	“ Stockholm ? As in Sweden ? ”
70180	70263	70175	70175	I	0	“ Yes . People do n’t associate the city with being the tech hub it is , but it was there that I wound up starting the company that would become Hoult Communications . It was Hoult Media at the time , and it offered mobile content like news , sports scores , et cetera . Once we developed a mobile payment technology , the company surpassed a billion dollars in value . I was twenty - seven when I sold it . ”
70264	70268	70269	70269	I	0	“ Holy shit . ”
70289	70300	70301	70301	I	0	“ So you spent four years away from your family , ”
70336	70490	70324	70324	I	0	“ It was n’t easy . But as time went on , the wall between us just got higher and higher . More and more miscommunications built up . My mother can be incredibly proud and hard headed , and when I asked if I could send her money , she took it as a slight . She thought I was trying to buy her forgiveness for abandoning them when this entire time , I swore she was the one who abandoned me . I was so angry for so long , and I missed my dad . A lot . I had always grown up telling myself I would be exactly like him , so with my mother and my relationship on the rocks , and Emmett just doing whatever he could to keep her afloat , I filled the void with a woman I worked with . Elizabet . Or Liz . ”
70491	70501	70648	70648	Julian	110	“ I ’m going to guess she ’s French . ”
70502	70517	70669	70669	he	110	“ Yes . She was something of an assistant to me at Hoult Media . ”
70518	70526	70527	70527	I	0	“ You were in love with her ? ”
70544	70630	70527	70527	I	0	“ I thought I was . In reality , I just wanted to replace the family I lost , and I was hasty . I picked someone I thought was important to me because I conflated her significance to me with the success of my company . She was in the office every day watching me grow it from a startup , and my perception of her was skewed thanks to that . After we split for good , I made a rule for myself . ”
70631	70643	70644	70644	I	0	“ Zero tolerance . Never sleep with or date an employee , ”
70656	70659	70648	70648	Julian	110	“ Yes . ”
70660	70665	70666	70666	I	0	“ Split for good ? ”
70672	70679	70669	70669	he	110	“ What caused the final split ? ”
70707	70747	70748	70748	I	0	“ Liz said for a long time , it was easy to pretend I loved her the way she loved me . But then Lucie came along , and she saw what real love looked like in my eyes . ”
70751	70754	70755	70755	I	0	“ Lucie ? ”
70770	70774	70767	70767	Julian	110	“ My daughter . ”
70790	70797	70798	70798	Julian	110	“ She is n’t biologically mine , ”
70805	70859	70798	70798	Julian	110	“ Liz got pregnant with her around the time of one of our breaks , but I specifically did n’t do anything to confirm paternity when Liz said the child belonged to me . I wanted a kid . I wanted that family . I raised Lucie till she was four years old . ”
70860	70865	70866	70866	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
70883	70889	70866	70866	I	0	“ How old were you ? ”
70890	70895	70896	70896	Julian	110	“ Twenty - five , ”
70899	70982	70896	70896	Julian	110	“ From the ages of twenty - five and twenty - nine , I was a dad . And a fucking good one . I was the father my own father raised me to become , and I was proud of myself . I adored Lucie in a way I did n’t know was possible . But Liz could n’t handle it . Lucie and I were closer than she was to either of us . Lucie had anxiety . Panic attacks . ”
71042	71059	71060	71060	Julian	110	“ I was the only one who could calm her down , and Liz resented that , ”
71063	71102	71060	71060	Julian	110	“ She resented that she was second best to the both of us . She resented that the love Lucie and I had together upstaged anything we had for her , and it was a painful daily reminder . ”
71103	71108	71109	71109	I	0	“ That sounds hard , ”
71154	71174	71175	71175	Julian	110	“ It had to be hard . I did n’t even realize myself how much it had to hurt , ”
71183	71242	71175	71175	Julian	110	“ I was just so hell - bent on having a family again . I was transfixed with Lucie , and with being a father . It felt like through the universe , my dad and I were somehow sharing a connection again . I knew exactly what he had felt when he was raising Emmett and me . ”
71258	71305	71253	71253	I	0	“ Lucie would look at pictures of my dad and say ‘ Grandpa , ’ and it was the best feeling . I was so over the moon , I did n’t know Liz was unhappy . I had no idea I was hurting her constantly . ”
71309	71324	71306	71306	He	110	“ And I had no idea that she was plotting to hurt me back . ”
71333	71336	71306	71306	He	110	“ How ? ”
71337	71389	71253	71253	I	0	“ I woke up one morning in December , and they were gone . Bags packed . Just gone . Liz did n’t tell me where she went with Lucie , and it was n’t till months later that I found out they moved to France , where Liz is from . ”
71390	71393	71394	71394	I	0	“ Biarritz ? ”
71397	71434	71394	71394	I	0	“ No , but close by . She had always talked about going there with her family growing up , and how it was always a dream , and she wanted to raise her children there . ”
71435	71442	71443	71443	I	0	“ So you built the resort , ”
71456	71514	71443	71443	I	0	“ Yes . Before all the renovations and additions , it started out as a home . A big one . Liz said if I somehow showed her my love , maybe she would come back . Just maybe . So I designed a fucking mansion for her . At least I said it was for her . ”
71515	71522	71546	71547	Julian Hoult	110	“ But it was for Lucie . ”
71523	71526	71443	71443	I	0	“ Yes . ”
71628	71675	71616	71616	she	1184	“ They live somewhere outside of Paris now . Liz told me she would make sure I ’d never be close to Lucie again . She promised me she would stop speaking English to her , and place her in a strictly French - speaking school . ”
71688	71699	71616	71616	she	1184	“ So Lucie would be unable to communicate with you ? ”
71700	71754	71758	71758	his	1188	“ Yes . She writes letters here and there , and I provide financial support here and there . But the relationship we once had is gone , and now that she ’s almost nine , I doubt she really remembers it . Which is okay . It ’s less painful for her . ”
71862	71865	71866	71866	I	0	“ Hey . ”
71903	71914	71915	71915	He	1188	“ I know it was hard to say all that . ”
71930	71940	71915	71915	He	1188	“ Not as hard as it could ’ve been . ”
71977	71982	71983	71983	she	100	“ You ’re awake , ”
71990	71996	71983	71983	she	100	“ I can see it . ”
72000	72011	71997	71997	I	0	“ I ’m awake . But I ’m still recovering . ”
72437	72447	72448	72448	Sara	100	“ You came all over my hand last night , ”
72464	72476	72448	72448	Sara	100	“ You were a very sleepy , sexy girl last night . ”
72477	72498	72499	72499	I	0	“ Mm , well , I ’m not going to lay there doing nothing if my man needs to come . ”
72504	72508	72509	72509	I	0	“ Your man ? ”
72770	72773	72774	72774	I	0	“ Easy , ”
72778	72795	72774	72774	I	0	“ Tell me what you want for breakfast . I ’m going to cook for you . ”
72799	72803	72796	72796	She	100	“ You are ? ”
72804	72815	72767	72767	I	0	“ Yes . But that requires a few things first . ”
72816	72819	72767	72767	I	0	“ What ? ”
72820	72849	72767	72767	I	0	“ We need to pack so we ’re ready to go after we eat . But even before that , we need to go on a grocery run . ”
72850	72856	72857	72857	Sara	100	“ And even before that ? ”
72899	72909	72883	72883	she	100	“ I think you know the answer to that . ”
72910	72915	72916	72916	Sara	100	“ Mm - hm . ”
73072	73081	73082	73082	she	100	“ I ’m on the pill , Julian , ”
73085	73091	73082	73082	she	100	“ And I ’m clean . ”
73470	73487	73488	73488	Julian	110	“ Let ’s just stay another night . We ’ll leave for the airport from here , ”
73508	73541	73542	73542	I	0	“ What ? You just told me you had somewhere to be at two . I ’m all packed . Once I finish drying this glass , we ’re good to go , ”
73564	73578	73546	73546	him	110	“ You ’re cute when you ’re mad at me for something small . ”
73579	73582	73583	73583	I	0	“ Versus ? ”
73596	73615	73616	73616	I	0	“ When you ’re mad at me for something like forcing you to change into work appropriate clothes . ”
73624	73633	73634	73634	Julian	110	“ God , that feels like forever ago . ”
73637	73642	73643	73643	he	110	“ Was n’t it ? ”
73688	73702	73703	73703	I	0	“ Hey , are n’t you always getting on Emmett for being late ? ”
73717	73726	73727	73727	He	110	“ Julian . Get up off the couch . ”
73730	73734	73727	73727	He	110	“ Come here . ”
73769	73774	73775	73775	I	0	“ What ’s up ? ”
73780	73792	73775	73775	I	0	“ Are you idling because you do n’t want to go ? ”
73793	73796	73797	73797	I	0	“ Yes . ”
73811	73861	73797	73797	I	0	“ I can imagine how hard it is to have to smile and fake nice for the rest of your family . I could n’t forgive them either . But it ’s only one day a year . It ’s for your grandma . And for Grandpa and Dad . ”
73862	73866	73867	73867	Julian	110	“ I know . ”
73886	73895	73883	73883	he	110	“ I want you to come with me . ”
73900	73903	73896	73896	My	0	“ What ? ”
73917	73920	73904	73904	I	0	“ Really ? ”
73921	73927	73883	73883	he	110	“ Yes . Will you ? ”
73928	73932	73933	73933	I	0	“ Of course , ”
73936	73948	73933	73933	I	0	“ But … wo n’t everyone think I ’m your girlfriend ? ”
73949	73960	73883	73883	he	110	“ Yes . But you can fake it , right ? ”
73961	73982	73983	73983	Julian	110	“ I have n’t had to fake it this entire last month , so I might be out of practice . ”
73988	74003	73983	73983	Julian	110	“ Are you trying to turn me on or get me out the door ? ”
74004	74008	74009	74009	I	0	“ The latter , ”
74021	74040	74018	74018	he	110	“ Come on , Hoult . Let ’s get our asses on that bike . We got this . ”
74043	74060	74067	74067	her	1204	“ Oh my God . I ’m seeing things . Rosie , am I seeing things ? ”
74101	74104	74105	74105	Julian	110	“ Mom , ”
74164	74186	74187	74187	she	1204	“ Oh , no ! No handshake . I need to hug the first woman my son ’s ever brought home , ”
74231	74236	74209	74209	his	110	“ Well , technically – ”
74237	74268	74269	74269	I	0	“ Oh , I know , Julian , technically , we ’re not home , this is a restaurant , but still . Sara , please . Come meet Rosemarie . ”
74309	74317	74305	74305	Rosemarie	158	“ Has he told you my nickname ? ”
74318	74323	74324	74324	I	0	“ Rosemarie The Reaper , ”
74335	74340	74341	74341	Rosemarie	178	“ That ’s right , ”
74346	74354	74341	74341	Rosemarie	178	“ Those boys are terrified of me . ”
74438	74446	74447	74447	Julian	110	“ You did better than I did , ”
74502	74509	74510	74510	I	0	“ Thanks . Are you okay ? ”
74525	74536	74537	74537	he	110	“ I ’m pretty damned good right now , actually , ”
74552	74561	74537	74537	he	110	“ Well . Now I ’m just okay , ”
74620	74625	74626	74626	I	0	“ Hi , Emmett , ”
74629	74641	74642	74642	he	110	“ Hi . I … think I owe you an apology , ”
74648	74659	74642	74642	he	110	“ Mind if I borrow her a sec , brother ? ”
74660	74664	74665	74665	Julian	110	“ I do . ”
74673	74680	74670	74670	Emmett	113	“ Where are you taking her ? ”
74681	74684	74685	74685	I	0	“ Julian , ”
74698	74716	74695	74695	he	110	“ Fine , borrow her . But return her to me as soon as possible , please . ”
74717	74725	74726	74726	I	0	“ You got it , lover boy . ”
74778	74783	74784	74784	Emmett	113	“ Look , I … ”
74789	74801	74786	74786	his	113	“ I do n’t even … well , first of all – ”
74802	74809	74810	74810	I	0	“ Emmett . Do n’t worry , ”
74814	74894	74895	74895	Emmett	113	“ I know it looked pretty bad that night when I ran away . I ’m not going to try to explain why I reacted so strongly , but what I will say is that your brother took pretty damned good care of me that night . I ’m fine now . You slipped up , but it ’s not the end of the world . I had a great weekend , and I ’m not angry at all . ”
74903	74915	74895	74895	Emmett	113	“ Wow . That went a lot better than I thought . ”
74916	74932	74933	74933	I	0	“ What , you thought I was going to be a raging bitch about it ? ”
74936	74980	74933	74933	I	0	“ No , but Julian tore me a new one all night after you guys left . He really did n’t let it go , he was beyond pissed for you . I was about to offer him my truck as an apology . ”
74981	74993	74994	74994	I	0	“ Well , we did take your truck home that night , ”
74997	75026	74994	74994	I	0	“ Yeah , but I mean for keeps . Anyway , thank you , Sara . I ’m so fucking grateful that you ’re not pissed at me , ”
75040	75058	75027	75027	Emmett	113	“ You probably know this , but my brother likes you a lot . I can tell . ”
75062	75068	75027	75027	Emmett	113	“ How can you tell ? ”
75069	75072	75073	75073	Emmett	113	“ Man . ”
75091	75142	75080	75080	he	113	“ It ’s kind of crazy , but I can see the difference in him . In just the way he looks and talks . Sometimes he can be kind of … vacant . Like he ’s on autopilot . And it just feels like he has n’t been lately . ”
75170	75201	75202	75202	he	113	“ It feels like he ’s actually in the moment , and present , and reacting . Like you flipped a light switch in him . Does that make sense ? ”
75205	75219	75202	75202	he	113	“ It makes perfect sense . And it ’s incredibly flattering to me . ”
75220	75232	75233	75233	Emmett	113	“ Well , I ’m actually not trying to flatter you , ”
75236	75295	75296	75296	I	0	“ It ’s just the truth . And listen , I know you guys are leaving for Biarritz tomorrow , and I just wanna say , when you ’re there with him … if you see or hear anything that mentions the name Lucie , do n’t … jump to conclusions . It ’s not what you think . ”
75321	75339	75296	75296	I	0	“ You ’re very sweet , Emmett , but Julian already told me about Liz and Lucie . ”
75340	75346	75347	75347	Emmett	113	“ Jesus fuck , seriously ? ”
75352	75358	75359	75359	He	113	“ Wow , that ’s … ”
75378	75400	75401	75401	He	113	“ That ’s really fucking amazing . That ’s really cool , ‘ cause I did n’t think he would ever – ”
75416	75513	75407	75407	He	113	“ Look , I ’m supposed to stop blowing up his spot , but I just got ta say – whatever he feels for you , Sara , I think it ’s pretty big . Right ? It ’s got ta be . It took me two years to get the full story about Liz and Lucie out of him . Lukas does n’t even know most of it , so … thank you for being someone my brother feels like he can talk to . He ’s never really chosen to have one of those . ”
75546	75549	75550	75550	I	0	“ Alright . ”
75564	75580	75581	75581	he	110	“ I ’m sure whatever you ’ve said by now , the damage is sufficient , ”
75587	75600	75581	75581	he	110	“ I ’ve come to collect her if you ’re finished here . ”
75601	75605	75606	75606	Julian	110	“ Sure am . ”
75614	75644	75606	75606	Julian	110	“ I know you might have just reached your limit of Hoults for today , but my mother is requesting some time with you , if that ’s okay . ”
75645	75652	75653	75653	I	0	“ That ’s more than okay , ”
75656	75662	75663	75663	Emmett	113	“ Shit , hold on , ”
75666	75681	75682	75682	he	110	“ Actually , I have one more thing to say to Sara , okay ? ”
75695	75709	75710	75710	he	110	“ Just go , J. She ’ll be right there . I promise , ”
75740	75815	75816	75816	Emmett	113	“ Look , I just wanted to say … in case he ever pisses you off , because Lord knows he pisses me off a lot … my brother ’s a really good man . The best I know . And when he cares about someone , he ’ll stop at nothing to make sure that person is happy , and safe , and completely taken care of for the rest of their life , ”
75825	75855	75816	75816	Emmett	113	“ There ’s really only a few people he regards that highly outside his family – Lukas being one of them , and I guess you being the other . ”
75856	75871	75872	75872	I	0	“ Sure you ’re not trying to butter me up right now , Emmett ? ”
75884	75900	75901	75901	Emmett	113	“ Yeah , I ’m not smart enough to blow smoke up people ’s asses , ”
75908	75937	75938	75938	he	113	“ What you see is what you get . And honestly , I was just telling you that because sometimes Julian … he can hurt people without realizing , ”
75949	76076	76077	76077	Emmett	113	“ He does n’t mean to – he ’s just so focused on something else , usually work . And if he somehow hurts your feelings during this trip because say , he ’s really busy , or distracted , or just plain being himself – just know that it ’s worth it to stick around with him . Even if you do n’t know what the hell he ’s thinking half the time , and you ca n’t stand that he does n’t say much . He ’s still a good man who ’s going to take care of you . I mean he ’s definitely the best guy I know . I ’m still kind of hoping to be him when I grow up , ”
76088	76098	76099	76099	I	0	“ Thank you , Emmett . I appreciate it , ”
76107	76117	76118	76118	he	113	“ Alright . Go talk to my mom now , ”
76121	76133	76134	76134	he	113	“ And sorry ahead of time if she brings up grandkids ! ”
76386	76395	76396	76396	she	137	“ There ’s more than where we live , ”
76416	76422	76423	76423	she	137	“ Daddy taught me that , ”
76440	76460	76423	76423	she	137	“ Yeah , he taught you that by bringing you to London and then forcing you to live here , ”
76465	76488	76423	76423	she	137	“ Yes , but now I have a car . I have these big roads . I can go anywhere I want . ”
76489	76494	76430	76430	she	137	“ You never do . ”
76495	76502	76430	76430	she	137	“ What am I doing now ? ”
76503	76522	76423	76423	she	137	“ What , it took me getting in trouble for you to start exploring ? That ’s sad . ”
76535	76541	76542	76542	Mom	137	“ Maybe that ’s sad , ”
76545	76568	76542	76542	Mom	137	“ But sometimes it takes a tragedy for us to get moving . To find the strength to look for better things . ”
76569	76577	76583	76583	I	0	“ So I ’m a tragedy now ? ”
77204	77230	77231	77232	my dad	1925	“ You should have found a school to transfer to in London . Your mother would have moved back here with you in a heartbeat , ”
77248	77264	77231	77232	my dad	1925	“ Yeah , right . Like you ’d survive being away from her so much . ”
77265	77286	77287	77287	I	0	“ I would fly to see you two every Friday . And then I ’d return to work on Monday . ”
77290	77315	77287	77287	I	0	“ We do n’t have the money for that . Sorry . But one day , I ’ll earn it for you . Promise . ”
77316	77321	77322	77322	Dad	145	“ I believe you . ”
77330	77418	77322	77322	Dad	145	“ You ’re hardworking enough , and the fact that you chose New York to start over tells me you ’re not scared of anything . But let me tell you something . Some people with your brains and your talent still get lost in a city as big as that one , because there are so many people and so much to do . But I believe in you that you ’ll look temptation in the eye , walk right past it and make yourself proud . ”
77419	77426	77287	77287	I	0	“ And you and Mama proud . ”
77427	77431	77432	77432	Dad	145	“ Us too , ”
77435	77567	77432	77432	Dad	145	“ No matter what you think sometimes , we could never stay mad at you . Sometimes , the heartbreak will hit us out of nowhere , because you ’re our daughter and we wish you never even had to experience what you did at that school . We get angry that you were hurt . You might see us during those times and think we ’re angry with you , but we ’re not . We ’re just going to take time to forget what happened , Sara . But eventually , we will . Your mother and I just want you to be safe and happy . That ’s all any parent wants . We ’re proud of you , Sara , and we believe very much in you . ”
77964	77973	77974	77974	Julian	110	“ I wish I ’d found you earlier , ”
77995	78008	78009	78009	I	0	“ I would have hired you to my company in a heartbeat . ”
78012	78036	78037	78037	I	0	“ Yeah , but that ’s the point . You would n’t have found me earlier , because I felt too safe there , ”
78040	78074	78037	78037	I	0	“ And after everything I ’d been through , there was nothing more important to me than feeling safe . Like there ’s nothing to worry about , and I can just relax . ”
78075	78078	78079	78079	Julian	110	“ Understood , ”
78202	78225	78226	78226	she	100	“ It ’s so crazy . There ’s old castles , but there ’s Art Deco , and there ’s this water , ”
78283	78300	78301	78301	she	100	“ If The Great Gatsby took place anywhere but West Egg , it would be here , ”
78647	78653	78654	78654	she	100	“ What are you thinking ? ”
78674	78677	78654	78654	she	100	“ Nothing . ”
78805	78812	78813	78813	Her	100	“ a glorious selection of condiments . ”
78823	78827	78828	78828	I	0	“ Why Tuscany ? ”
78831	78835	78828	78828	I	0	“ Because wine . ”
78836	78843	78770	78770	her	100	“ Fair enough . Why Monaco ? ”
78844	78849	78828	78828	I	0	“ Because Grace Kelly . ”
78850	78863	78828	78828	I	0	“ Your best friend once said my mother looked like Grace Kelly . ”
78864	78901	78770	78770	her	100	“ She so does ! I totally thought that yesterday . And Lia totally went on her Grace Kelly kick because of me . She ’d never watch old Hollywood movies without me bugging her to . ”
78921	78925	78926	78926	She	138	“ Biggest goal ? ”
78938	78964	78965	78965	she	138	“ The thing I dreamed for longest about was definitely going to prom and feeling like a princess in some big , puffy ball gown , ”
78968	79008	78965	78965	she	138	“ Since I was five , I fantasized about every detail down to the big reveal of my dress , and the walk down the stairs , and my date putting on my corsage as my parents took pictures . ”
79009	79012	78926	78926	She	138	“ Jesus . ”
79013	79025	79026	79026	she	138	“ Do n’t blame me . The stupid movies ruined me , ”
79029	79086	79026	79026	she	138	“ But anyway , since that ship has clearly sailed , I ’d say the big goal is making enough money in the future to buy my parents a home in London . So they can fly back and forth between there and Texas . A three - bedroom , preferably . For when I visit . ”
79087	79098	78926	78926	She	138	“ Why three bedrooms ? Do your parents sleep separately ? ”
79099	79119	79178	79178	she	1329	“ My dad does snore like a beast , but no . I imagined for like , my kids . ”
79120	79131	79026	79026	she	138	“ Yeah ? And how many kids do you want ? ”
79132	79135	79136	79136	She	1329	“ Three . ”
79146	79149	79143	79143	she	1329	“ Yourself ? ”
79150	79160	79161	79161	I	0	“ At least one . No more than three , ”

79287	79334	79335	79335	Colin	130	“ So , Turner and Carter are here , and they ’re … clearly not accustomed to working straight off a flight . Carter is going to sleep in his room right now , but Turner insists he ’ll come for your meeting with the advisors . ”
79338	79360	79335	79335	Colin	130	“ He made it a really big deal that he was bestowing us with his presence , considering his jet lag . ”
79364	79381	79335	79335	Colin	130	“ Jesus . I do n’t even need him here anymore . His work is done . ”
79382	79445	79446	79446	Colin	130	“ Yes , well , now he just needs to be babysat and ego - stroked while you talk to the guys with the brains . Speaking of them , they ’re early for the meeting in the salon , but I had the kitchen set up coffee and a breakfast platter in the meantime . Is , um , Sara joining ? ”
79471	79487	79488	79488	I	0	“ I would say it ’s not what it looks like , but it is , ”
79509	79539	79499	79499	Colin	130	“ Oh . Well , she ’s extremely smart , kind and capable , so if a rule were to be broken for anyone , it should be her . ”
79540	79545	79546	79546	I	0	“ I appreciate it , ”
79559	79591	79592	79592	I	0	“ To answer your question , Sara wo n’t be joining this meeting . She needs to meet with members of hotel staff to prep the Roths ’ tour after breakfast , ”
79610	79633	79634	79634	he	130	“ Uh , sir – I know the itinerary is clear , but Turner specifically requested that she join us at breakfast , ”
79640	79662	79637	79637	I	0	“ She ’s busy right now , so I ’ll have her join late . See you down there in ten . ”

80078	80102	80075	80075	he	108	“ The party does n’t start till this one arrives . Gentlemen , meet the star of the show , Miss Sara Hanna . ”
80247	80260	80261	80261	Turner	108	“ Man , I ca n’t wait to take you surfing later , ”
80274	80293	80294	80294	I	0	“ Turner , I think we made it clear that I ’m actually not very good at that , ”
80309	80338	80306	80306	his	108	“ Well , I thought it was clear that my enjoyment came less from watching you succeed , and more from watching you splash around in a bikini . ”
80601	80610	80611	80611	he	108	“ My back is stiff from the flight , ”
80674	80683	80684	80684	Turner	108	“ Sara looks like she needs a massage , ”
80698	80717	80718	80718	he	108	“ Maybe we should get a couple ’s massage . You look like you ’re probably very tight , ”

80883	80900	80901	80901	he	110	“ I just want you to have some time to enjoy yourself while you ’re here , ”
80908	80926	80901	80901	he	110	“ And I do like keeping elements of my business to myself . I hope you understand . ”

82295	82340	82288	82288	I	0	“ Do you have any idea how difficult it is to carry on with a meeting when all I can think about is you ? When all I can see is your perfect fucking body getting rubbed down by hands that are n’t mine ? ”
82341	82350	82351	82351	I	0	“ I ’m sorry I ruined your meeting , ”
82354	82363	82364	82364	Julian	110	“ You ’ll make it up to me , ”

83137	83161	83162	83162	he	179	“ To be frank with you , Julian , the Roths have long made up their mind . I think you know that , ”
83173	83231	83162	83162	he	179	“ At this point , we really only need to go through formalities . Then we ’ll get into the extensive paperwork , but as you know , we ’re all very pleased with how well this suits Turner and Carter ’s endeavors . I realize it ’s barely noon , but we should toast to that . ”
83232	83237	83238	83238	Colin	130	“ Just in time , ”

84982	84995	84996	84996	he	110	“ That ’s fine , I can see plenty as it is , ”
85034	85052	85053	85053	he	110	“ Listen , Sara , what can you tell me about the age demographics in this town ? ”
85066	85075	85076	85076	Turner	108	“ The residential population or the tourist population ? ”
85079	85082	85076	85076	Turner	108	“ Whatever . ”
85083	85108	85053	85053	he	110	“ Well , starting with the population on a regular basis , it ’s about twenty - five thousand with a median age around – ”
85109	85131	85076	85076	Turner	108	“ Honestly , all I really want to know is why I ’m having trouble finding girls as pretty as you . ”
85179	85191	85157	85157	he	110	“ I think that ’s above my pay grade , Turner . ”
85192	85218	85219	85219	Turner	108	“ You ’re funny . Seriously though , Sara – what does it feel like to be the most beautiful woman in Biarritz right now ? ”
85234	85273	85274	85274	he	108	“ Do n’t laugh ! Trust me , I ’ve been looking around , I ’ve given it a few shots here and there , but so far , the talent is surprisingly bleak for a surf town , ”
85283	85292	85274	85274	he	108	“ You never pressed your floor , Turner , ”
85312	85325	85326	85326	He	108	“ I have a question about the age demographics . Business stuff . ”
85337	85344	85334	85334	his	108	“ Can you help me out ? ”
85345	85381	85382	85382	I	0	“ Absolutely . Would you like to schedule for all of us to meet a little early before dinner ? I ’m sure Julian ’s on the premises , so that can be easily arranged , ”
85401	85419	85420	85420	he	108	“ Nah . I ’ve already got you here . Let ’s just talk in your room , ”
85454	85466	85467	85467	I	0	“ No , Turner , we should meet in the salon , ”
85471	85485	85467	85467	I	0	“ Oh , come on , sweetheart . Do n’t be so rigid . ”
85522	85529	85517	85517	She	101	“ Just humor me , Sara . ”

85641	85655	85633	85633	he	108	“ My room is not a space for a business meeting , Turner . ”
85656	85667	85732	85732	his	108	“ Fine , then let ’s do something besides business . ”
85685	85704	85680	85680	I	0	“ Considering business is precisely what we ’re here for , my answer is going to be no . ”
85705	85724	85680	85680	I	0	“ Let ’s be real – your business here is a little different than that of the guys . ”
85725	85729	85730	85730	Turner	108	“ Come again ? ”
85737	85752	85730	85730	Turner	108	“ Oh , no … you think I do n’t know , do you ? ”
85766	85770	85757	85757	I	0	“ Know what ? ”
85771	85777	85778	85778	he	108	“ Why you were hired , ”

85842	85848	85849	85849	he	108	“ Come on , Sara , ”
85853	85904	85905	85905	he	108	“ Girls like you get jobs like these because they ’re pretty . Because their asses look good in little skirts . You ’re hired strictly to make deals go more smoothly for guys like Julian . It ’s why he hired you to oversee the changes at this resort , ”
85936	85983	85933	85933	Turner	108	“ Julian put you out here because people are more inclined to do what you say , Sara . You ’re sweet , and friendly , and pretty , and they subconsciously want to please you . Hell , I know I want to please you . ”
85984	86007	86008	86008	I	0	“ Turner , from what I observed before you joined me in the elevator , you have your choice of women here , ”
86012	86037	86008	86008	I	0	“ Well , they do n’t do it for me . I tried using them to scratch the itch – it did n’t work . ”
86069	86086	86066	86066	I	0	“ Turner , I do have to get ready . I ’ll see you at dinner . ”
86099	86111	86087	86087	His	1457	“ That ass of yours is telling me to come in . ”
86112	86120	86121	86121	I	0	“ I assure you it ’s not , ”
86128	86146	86147	86147	he	1457	“ Christ . So why even dress like that if you do n’t want me to react ? ”
86163	86189	86157	86157	I	0	“ You ’re asking me to fuck you and then telling me you do n’t want it . Is that not what ’s going on ? ”
86256	86352	86250	86250	I	0	“ Mr. Roth , as it turns out , women sometimes do things for their own pleasure and happiness . I wear my clothes because I like them , and because I feel good in them . I enjoy feeling attractive , and if that catches your attention , then you are welcome to look . But unless I invite you , do not ever touch or assume you ’re entitled to . Using the way I dress as an excuse for your lack of respect or self - control is not justified or sufficient . ”
86358	86361	86362	86362	I	0	“ Okay ? ”
86388	86401	86384	86384	his	108	“ You know , you ’re different than all the other girls . ”
86402	86434	86384	86384	his	108	“ I ’m not . I ’m just different from the ones you pursue . Cast a wider net and you ’ll meet plenty of women willing to speak their minds . ”
86443	86455	86456	86456	Turner	108	“ Why look for them when I ’ve already got you ? ”
86465	86479	86480	86480	he	108	“ Come on , sweetheart . Just let me in for a second , ”
86483	86494	86480	86480	he	108	“ I ’ll keep it strictly business – pinky swear . ”
86500	86512	86480	86480	he	108	“ We can discuss anything you want right in this hall . ”
86513	86555	86556	86556	he	108	“ I do n’t want to discuss it in the hall , Sara , and considering I ’m the one making all the final decisions on this trip , you should probably think twice about being so difficult to work with , ”
86578	86663	86568	86568	He	108	“ You know Hoult needs this deal . I ’m by far his highest bidder for this resort , and Roth Entertainment is the only , and I mean only company that can launch Empire Stadium into becoming the most lucrative stadium in New York . Considering the competition , that ’s a big fucking deal in that town . And it ’s a big deal to his family – I ’m sure you know how important his family is to him . Right ? ”
86664	86668	86669	86669	I	0	“ I do , ”

87852	87871	87848	87848	he	179	“ At least let Sara stay . Girl just wants to party . Do n’t you , Sara ? ”
87915	87929	87930	87930	she	1479	“ No , Turner , I think I ’d just like to sleep , ”

88833	88870	88871	88871	he	110	“ Yeah , I ’m pissed I did n’t get to see those things that night at the pool . I swear she was shaking them around on purpose to get my dick fuckin ’ hard , ”
88899	88910	88894	88894	his	110	“ Should ’ve fucked her right in front of Julian . ”
88960	88963	88964	88964	he	110	“ Baby , ”
88981	88997	88974	88974	I	0	“ I fuckin ’ tried getting in her room today . She shut me down . ”

90083	90091	90092	90092	Julian	110	“ Thank you , by the way , ”
90120	90124	90125	90125	I	0	“ For what ? ”
90129	90137	90125	90125	I	0	“ Making this trip easier for me . ”
90138	90149	90095	90095	he	110	“ I hardly did anything with the Roths this trip . ”
90150	90161	90162	90162	he	110	“ I do n’t mean in regards to the sale , ”
90180	90201	90162	90162	he	110	“ I mean just … being here . In Biarritz . It ’s not usually an easy trip for me . ”
90258	90276	90277	90277	I	0	“ I did n’t even think about how hard it was for you to come back here , ”
90284	90326	90327	90327	Julian	110	“ It usually is , but it was n’t this time . I barely recognize this place when I ’m here with you . It just feels like another beautiful French city when I get to see it through your eyes , ”
90349	90378	90341	90341	He	110	“ That said I hope you did n’t enjoy your time here too much , because I have no intention of ever coming back once we ’re gone . ”
90379	90387	90388	90388	I	0	“ I can always come here alone , ”
90391	90404	90405	90405	Julian	110	“ It would be a waste to let you go somewhere alone , ”
90408	90413	90405	90405	Julian	110	“ Why ’s that ? ”
90414	90429	90430	90430	he	110	“ Because you ’re so beautiful when you see something for the first time , ”
90434	90447	90430	90430	he	110	“ I would n’t want to miss all those faces you make . ”
90452	90462	90448	90448	I	0	“ Are you trying to make my cheeks hurt ? ”
90463	90491	90492	90492	he	110	“ I ’m not . But I ’ve become pretty dependent on seeing that smile , so whatever makes you happy , I ’ll keep doing it , ”
90621	90626	90627	90627	I	0	“ What ’s that ? ”
90645	90655	90637	90637	Julian	110	“ Hey . I ’m sorry I woke you . ”
90656	90668	90669	90669	I	0	“ You did n’t . I just stir here and there , ”
90681	90687	90688	90688	I	0	“ Is that from Lucie ? ”
90728	90757	90724	90724	he	110	“ It ’s the last letter she sent where she wrote that she missed me , and she still did n’t understand why she could n’t see me . ”
90758	90766	90724	90724	he	110	“ How long ago is it from ? ”
90767	90796	90797	90797	Julian	110	“ About two - and - a - half years ago . She had just turned six . She ’s thanking me for the birthday presents in this , ”
90807	90817	90797	90797	Julian	110	“ Oh . You … know where they live ? ”
90818	90821	90724	90724	he	110	“ Yes . ”
90822	90837	90838	90838	My	0	“ And you do n’t ever get tempted to go there and find them ? ”
90859	90880	90881	90881	Julian	110	“ I thought about it every business trip I ’ve ever taken out here . I thought about it today , ”
90918	90934	90910	90910	I	0	“ Figured it was almost like a last chance . But I decided against it . ”
90935	90938	90915	90915	he	110	“ Why ? ”
90939	91035	91036	91036	I	0	“ Because she ’s perfectly adjusted now . She ’s moved on from her memories of me , and it would be selfish for me to barrel into her life now and ruin the peace . She ’s still too young to fully understand the situation . She would n’t know how to handle the fact that her mother has fed her lies about me . She ’d just feel confusion and resentment , and all I want is for her to be happy . I do n’t want her to feel what I feel . ”
91080	91095	91096	91096	I	0	“ You ’re a good man to give her the peace to move on , ”
91099	91118	91096	91096	I	0	“ Most people would just indulge their impulses without thinking about how it might affect the other person . ”
91130	91152	91153	91153	I	0	“ I think it ’s noble for you to take on the hurt for her . Not everybody would do that , ”
91257	91279	91280	91280	I	0	“ Maybe in the future , you two can reconnect , and you can give her your side of the story , ”
91283	91299	91280	91280	I	0	“ I hope she understands by then why I eventually stopped trying to see her . ”
91300	91304	91305	91305	I	0	“ She will , ”
91308	91358	91305	91305	I	0	“ Everyone finds out eventually how fragile the healing process is . Maybe she ’ll figure it out after her first big breakup , and she ’ll understand that even after the wound ’s closed , it ’s still delicate , and sensitive , and it still needs time . ”
91366	91371	91372	91372	he	110	“ What about yours ? ”
91375	91381	91372	91372	he	110	“ What ? My wound ? ”
91388	91408	91382	91382	I	0	“ It ’s been healing since we left the Hamptons . It ’s in pretty good shape so far . ”
91409	91412	91413	91413	Julian	110	“ Good . ”
91440	91451	91452	91452	he	110	“ By the way , you ’re good at this , ”
91455	91458	91452	91452	he	110	“ What ? ”
91459	91464	91465	91465	I	0	“ Making me happy . ”
91478	91488	91489	91489	I	0	“ You have that touch with me , too , ”
91688	91691	91683	91683	I	0	“ Julian ? ”
91754	91762	91763	91763	I	0	“ Where did you just come from ? ”
91766	91794	91763	91763	I	0	“ The last meeting . They wanted to move it up , and I did n’t want to wake you . You were smiling in your sleep . ”
91795	91799	91800	91800	I	0	“ Was I ? ”
91808	91816	91800	91800	I	0	“ You were . It was cute , ”
91822	91842	91817	91817	Julian	110	“ But we have to go now . We have a flight to catch in less than an hour . ”
91847	91859	91817	91817	Julian	110	“ Really ? So it ’s … all done ? Everything ? ”
91923	91929	91930	91930	he	110	“ Get dressed , Sara , ”
91943	91955	91930	91930	he	110	“ I need you ready to go as soon as possible . ”
91956	91967	91938	91938	he	110	“ Is everything okay ? Did you finalize the deal ? ”
91968	91981	91938	91938	he	110	“ All but . Everything will be finalized back in New York . ”
91982	91991	91992	91992	I	0	“ Are n’t you happy it ’s done ? ”
92002	92005	92006	92006	Julian	110	“ Very , ”
92019	92036	92006	92006	Julian	110	“ But we can celebrate on the plane . We really do have to leave soon . ”
92097	92100	92101	92101	I	0	“ Okay , ”
92105	92115	92101	92101	I	0	“ I ’ll be ready to go in ten . ”
92152	92158	92141	92141	he	110	“ Stay with me tonight , ”
92240	92249	92250	92250	I	0	“ Of course this is where you live , ”
92295	92298	92301	92301	him	110	“ Whoa . ”
92358	92365	92366	92366	Julian	110	“ Meet me on the terrace , ”
92375	92383	92366	92366	Julian	110	“ I ’ll pour us some wine . ”
92536	92541	92542	92542	I	0	“ Enjoying the view ? ”
92560	92566	92567	92567	I	0	“ How could I not ? ”
92582	92612	92613	92613	Julian	110	“ Please tell me you ’re not too jaded to ever come out here , because if that ’s the case , I might actually have to smack you . ”
92616	92632	92613	92613	Julian	110	“ I ’m out here often , actually . Generally when I ca n’t sleep . ”
92633	92660	92661	92661	I	0	“ So , what , you come out here in your velvet robe with a glass of Scotch and gaze out at Gotham like Bruce Wayne ? ”
92667	92684	92664	92664	Julian	110	“ More like a pair of sweatpants , a book , and a glass of water . ”
92685	92695	92696	92696	I	0	“ Mm . That ’s an even sexier image , ”
92760	92768	92752	92752	Julian	110	“ I have a proposal for you . ”
92775	92778	92752	92752	Julian	110	“ Hm ? ”
92779	92790	92791	92791	I	0	“ I want you to stay home from work tomorrow . ”
92798	92801	92791	92791	I	0	“ Why ? ”
92802	92811	92812	92812	Julian	110	“ Because I want you to stay here , ”
92829	92850	92822	92822	I	0	“ I think I took a page from your book and developed a vivid fantasy while we were in Biarritz . ”
92851	92857	92791	92791	I	0	“ Oh ? What fantasy ? ”
92858	92870	92871	92871	My	0	“ Coming home to you after a long day of work . ”
92876	92880	92881	92881	I	0	“ Julian Hoult , ”

92924	92949	92950	92950	I	0	“ Mm , totally . So , tell me more about this fantasy . What am I … what am I wearing in it ? ”
92977	93003	92958	92958	Julian	110	“ Honestly , I imagined everything . A robe . One of my shirts over a pair of your panties . One of my hoodies – ”
93004	93009	93010	93010	I	0	“ You own hoodies ? ”
93014	93017	93010	93010	I	0	“ Two . ”
93018	93032	92958	92958	Julian	110	“ Let me guess , one is an Empires American League Champs hoodie . ”
93033	93036	93037	93037	Julian	110	“ Correct , ”
93040	93060	93037	93037	Julian	110	“ The other is from my days at Columbia . Probably have n’t worn it since I was nineteen . ”
93061	93073	92958	92958	Julian	110	“ It ’s weird to think that you were ever nineteen . ”
93074	93084	92958	92958	Julian	110	“ Not at all sure how to take that . ”
93085	93101	93102	93102	I	0	“ You just seem like you were always a wise , ridiculously handsome grown man , ”
93105	93116	93102	93102	I	0	“ So in some way , that was a compliment . ”
93117	93122	93123	93123	Julian	110	“ Thank you then , ”
93243	93248	93249	93249	I	0	“ Ca n’t sleep ? ”

93273	93285	93286	93286	I	0	“ Is n’t this when you usually go to the terrace ? ”
93292	93295	93289	93289	He	110	“ Yes . ”
93754	93757	93758	93758	I	0	“ Hey . ”

95953	95956	95957	95957	Julian	110	“ No , ”

95971	96012	96013	96013	I	0	“ The opening for this position with Una is time sensitive . It ’s a spot people are vying for , and if your goal is to work with the company , I would suggest you jump at this chance . ”
96245	96255	96256	96256	I	0	“ Julian – what the hell is going on ? ”
96274	96303	96304	96304	Julian	110	“ Why are you talking to me like this ? And why do you keep mentioning Hoult International ? What do they have to do with this conversation ? ”
96310	96323	96324	96324	he	110	“ There were no open positions at Una Magazine in the States , ”

96380	96394	96369	96369	I	0	“ Julian , what are you trying to do to me right now ? ”

96793	96871	96789	96789	I	0	“ So if you refuse to let yourself feel for me anymore , then fine . I wo n’t grovel . But at least , explain to me what happened here , because you said you loved me last night , and a day later , you ’re trying to get me as far away from you as possible . You know how cruel you ’re being right now . And you know I deserve an answer . ”

97008	97023	96999	96999	he	110	“ But what I want and what I need are two very different things . ”

97359	97401	97402	97402	he	113	“ Technically , it ’s your suite because you own the stadium . Got that . Do n’t care . If you ’re gon na sit with me , you ’re going to at least try to have a good time , ”

97471	97505	97506	97506	Emmett	113	“ Yeah , he ’s fine . No , do n’t tell your friend to come over – trust me , that ’ll be pointless . He ’s just getting over a girl . ”

97745	97762	97740	97740	Sara	100	“ Do you honestly believe that I would ask this of anyone who works for me ? ”
97763	97774	97775	97775	Turner	108	“ You could . You know well that you could , ”
97802	97840	97841	97841	Turner	108	“ You ’re Julian Hoult . You ’re like me . You have resources . You have money , possessions and connections that people wo n’t ever get in their lives even if they work their hardest , ”
97844	97948	97841	97841	Turner	108	“ Now , come on . Think of one thing you can hold over Sara ’s head . It could be as simple as her job . Just tell her you ’ll fire her if she does n’t say yes . I mean for fuck ’s sake , I ’m asking for a weekend . One weekend . And I ’ll be taking her somewhere nice . I ’m not going to fucking lock her in a dungeon – I ’ll wine and dine her and all that jazz . You just need to make it clear that I expect her to reciprocate . ”
97949	97966	97991	97993	the fucking Joker	1614	“ You are out of your fucking mind , and that ’s not going to happen . ”
97967	97987	97988	97988	Turner	108	“ Then I ’m pulling out of this deal and blacklisting Empire Stadium from all future Roth Entertainment events , ”

98011	98070	98008	98008	he	108	“ But before you do that , ask yourself if it ’s really worth it for some girl . I ’m not fucking buying her from you and turning her into my sex slave . I want to fuck her a couple times over a weekend and move on . You know me . I like the chase . ”
98071	98091	98156	98157	that person	862	“ Then you ’ll love the fact that you ’ll never in your life lay a finger on Sara . ”
98092	98130	98133	98133	Turner	108	“ Hoult . Do n’t talk about her like she ’s some precious little sweetheart . Trust me , she has experience in this kind of thing . You do n’t know what I ’m talking about ? ”

99211	99249	99189	99189	she	101	“ Lukas will move into the Hamptons home full - time . He wo n’t even mind . And if he does , then tough . That ’s what he gets for staying friends with that guy . ”

99727	99760	99724	99724	I	0	“ No . I ’m at Lukas ’s office . He was in the conference room , and I was right outside the door when I realized he was talking to Julian . ”
99761	99771	99710	99710	Lia	101	“ Oh my God , you said his name . ”
99772	99777	99778	99778	Lia	101	“ Omigod ! Shit , ”
99781	99792	99778	99778	Lia	101	“ Damn it . We had such a streak going . ”
99793	99798	99799	99799	I	0	“ It ’s fine , ”
100085	100087	100098	100098	she	101	“ heard ”
100105	100108	100098	100098	she	101	“ deliberately eavesdropped ”
100112	100117	100118	100118	she	101	“ Did you know … ”
100126	100134	100135	100135	I	0	“ Did I know what , Lia ? ”
100138	100153	100118	100118	she	101	“ What was the name of the place you went to in France again ? ”
100154	100157	100158	100158	I	0	“ Biarritz , ”
100167	100175	100176	100176	I	0	“ Why are you asking about Biarritz ? ”
100184	100199	100176	100176	I	0	“ You were there to sell Julian ’s resort to those guys , right ? ”
100200	100215	100216	100216	I	0	“ Yes . They ’re in negotiations now . They ’ll probably finish soon , ”
100235	100238	100228	100228	Lia	101	“ Um … ”
100239	100244	100176	100176	I	0	“ Lia . What ? ”
100245	100256	100257	100257	I	0	“ I overheard today that that deal never went through . ”
100260	100263	100257	100257	I	0	“ What ? ”
100264	100295	100176	100176	I	0	“ The deal with the Perv Bros ? It got nixed while you guys were still in , um , Bi … Buh ... how do you say it again ? ”
100296	100299	100176	100176	I	0	“ Biarritz . ”
100300	100330	100257	100257	I	0	“ That . Anyway , I may or may not have threatened Lukas for information when we got home , under the promise that I ’d never tell you – ”
100331	100342	100176	100176	I	0	“ Did he really believe you would n’t tell me ? ”
100343	100354	100355	100355	Lia	101	“ No , it was probably for his own conscience , ”
100359	100461	100355	100355	Lia	101	“ But anyway , what Lukas said was that Turner said something ‘ indecent ’ to Julian that resulted in Julian ‘ knocking him the fuck out ’ the last day you guys were there . And whichever Perv Bro he knocked out , that guy ’s still harassing him . So I guess right now , Julian and Lukas are putting their minds together to fight fire with fire . I swear to God , you give those boys a grudge to hold against someone , and they ’ll team up to annihilate you . Their brains together are scary . ”
100462	100470	100471	100471	I	0	“ Hold up , Lia – focus , ”
100479	100498	100471	100471	I	0	“ So Julian has n’t been doing business with the Roths this whole time I ’ve been gone ? ”
100499	100517	100355	100355	Lia	101	“ Girl , no . Unless by doing business you mean plotting ways to kill each other . ”
100518	100521	100522	100522	I	0	“ Shit , ”

100632	100639	100640	100640	I	0	“ Fuck . I screwed him , ”
100643	100657	100640	100640	I	0	“ You sure did , girl . On every surface at his office . ”

100662	100717	100608	100609	the men	822	“ Sorry , sorry . But please , please , Sara , do n’t punish me for telling you this by blaming yourself and spiraling into some dark place . I know I ’m biased here , but if this is anyone ’s fault besides those nasty Perv Bros , it ’s Julian ’s . ”
100718	100723	100640	100640	I	0	“ Lia , stop – ”
100724	100785	100786	100786	she	1674	“ I ’m serious . He chose to hire you when he already had feelings about you – even if they were just minor then , he knew the risks that came with this . He was just cocky that he could stay professional as always . He had no idea what the fuck he was up against with you , ”
100795	100809	100792	100792	her	1674	“ You ’re taking way too much pleasure in this conversation right now . ”
100810	100835	100836	100836	she	1674	“ Only because I feel the wheels turning in your brain right now , and it ’s giving me this strange best friend ESP , ”
100839	100850	100851	100851	I	0	“ Really . And what am I thinking right now ? ”
100854	100865	100851	100851	I	0	“ That you need to talk to him in person . ”
100866	100869	100792	100792	her	1674	“ Fine . ”
100870	100877	100792	100792	her	1674	“ In New York . Right ? ”
100878	100881	100792	100792	her	1674	“ Yes . ”
100909	100962	100963	100963	Lia	101	“ But just thinking about it scares me right now . I ca n’t handle the thought of going there , getting to his office and being told by reception that he has no time for me . Or worse , being told by Julian that he has no time for me . ”
100966	101035	101036	101036	Lia	101	“ Look , Sara . None of this would ’ve blown up if Julian did n’t get emotionally invested in you . He could have closed the deal easy if it were n’t for the fact that he fell for you . Do you know how many other times he ’s done business by looking the other way when someone got screwed ? He ’s a ruthless asshole , ”
101039	101051	101036	101036	Lia	101	“ I do n’t know where you ’re going with this . ”
101052	101106	100963	100963	Lia	101	“ I ’m saying he probably still cares about you . At this point , we both have reason to suspect that this deal fell through because he was in some way defending you . So why are you afraid to just fly home for the weekend and get yourself some real closure ? ”
101107	101190	101036	101036	Lia	101	“ Because I ’ve seen how easily Julian can flip the switch , Lia , and it ’s as hurtful as it is scary . He can go from loving one second to completely unrecognizable the next . He acts cold and distant , like he ’s never even met you . It ’s not something you can forget easily , and I ’m afraid to see it again . I ’m afraid it ’s going to hurt me all over again . ”
101191	101238	100963	100963	Lia	101	“ Well , you stayed at June Magazine longer than you wanted because you were afraid that no other job would ever take you . Maybe you ’ll stay in London longer than you want because you ’re afraid of ever coming back to New York . ”
101239	101244	101245	101245	I	0	“ Jesus , Lia , ”
101260	101267	101245	101245	I	0	“ You know I ’m right . ”
101273	101292	101245	101245	I	0	“ I also know you ’re doing something sketchy right now . Why are you typing so fast ? ”
101293	101297	101245	101245	I	0	“ Searching flights . ”
101298	101301	101245	101245	I	0	“ Ugh . ”
101302	101318	101245	101245	I	0	“ Humor me . Tell me one good thing about Julian . Your favorite memory . ”
101319	101322	101245	101245	I	0	“ Why ? ”
101323	101328	101329	101329	I	0	“ Just do it . ”
101553	101558	101559	101559	I	0	“ Does that suffice ? ”
101566	101595	101596	101596	she	101	“ You tell me . I was only asking you to tell me all those stories so you ’d remind yourself what a surprisingly good guy he is , ”
101605	101622	101596	101596	she	101	“ Are you still convinced he ’ll give you the cold shoulder if you come back ? ”
101628	101646	101596	101596	she	101	“ No . I think he ’ll at least hear me out . Maybe even over lunch . ”
101647	101658	101596	101596	she	101	“ He ’ll probably use that corporate voice you love . ”
101659	101662	101663	101663	I	0	“ Ugh . ”
101669	101700	101663	101663	I	0	“ Fuck it . Send me the links for the flight . I ’ll suck it up if he goes Corporate Julian on me . I just need the answers . ”
101701	101708	101709	101709	Lia	101	“ You got it , girl , ”
101766	101777	101778	101778	I	0	“ That does n’t give me time to mentally prepare , ”
101781	101792	101793	101793	she	101	“ Mentally preparing leads to you backing out of this , ”
101796	101804	101793	101793	she	101	“ Also , I just booked it . ”
101805	101810	101723	101723	her	101	“ Are you kidding ? ”
101811	101817	101894	101894	I	0	“ No . Happy birthday . ”

101826	101850	101851	101851	Lia	101	“ Happy Fourth of July then , I do n’t know ! Are n’t you excited to see me as soon as tomorrow ? ”
101854	101867	101851	101851	Lia	101	“ It ’s been five weeks since I ’ve smelled your hair . ”
101868	101871	101793	101793	she	101	“ Creepy . ”

101933	101951	101929	101929	Lia	101	“ Departing tomorrow at seven forty - five in the morning ? Are you joking , Lia ? ”
101952	101968	101969	101969	she	101	“ Again , not giving you time to think twice about this . Still scared ? ”

105037	105062	105032	105032	I	0	“ Really , Mr. Hoult . That ’s interesting , since the rest of that wish list is entirely up to me to complete . ”

105221	105234	105235	105235	I	0	“ So where are you taking me tonight ? Monaco or Tuscany ? ”
105249	105260	105244	105244	he	110	“ And do Lukas and Lia know about the trip ? ”
105264	105279	105244	105244	he	110	“ Because they ’re kind of expecting us at our reservation in thirty minutes . ”
105280	105296	105244	105244	he	110	“ I ’m sorry , baby , but we ’re not leaving the country tonight . ”
105297	105327	105328	105328	Julian	110	“ But you said we were covering another part of the wish list tonight , and I do n’t see myself buying a house for my parents before midnight . ”

105404	105445	105446	105446	Julian	110	“ You said you wanted to buy a three - bedroom for your parents , so you could visit with your kids . And I kind of imagined from the day you said it that they would be our kids , ”
105477	105560	105561	105561	he	1737	“ Sara , you ’ve been everything I ’ve ever wanted from the moment I laid eyes on you , and every day I spend with you , I find myself wanting more . I want to bring you to Monaco and Tuscany . I want to see you walk down the aisle to me in a big white dress . I want to see the way your eyes light up around our children . I think you rubbed off on me , ”
105564	105632	105561	105561	he	1737	“ because all I do these days is fantasize about you , and us and the life we ’re going to have together . You make me want to be a better man , and the best father in the world . For all the ways you ’ve changed my life , and all the happiness you ’ve brought me , you deserve nothing short of that . ”

We do n’t bring parties home at the end of the night and we ’re respectful of the fact that this townhouse was built in 1901 . The floors creak , the walls are thin and we can easily hear each other if the volume goes above a certain level . That ’s why we do n’t wear shoes in the house , we do n’t slam doors , we do n’t have guests past a certain hour and we make sure to be quiet after 10PM . ”

You were literally dripping wet when you met this alleged babe and ten minutes later , you ’re getting conveniently naked in his apartment . Also , in the three years that I ’ve known you , I ’ve heard you describe a man as ‘ crazy hot ’ like , three times tops and two of those times we were watching a movie . ”
110211	110214	110215	110215	I	0	“ Inception , ”
110218	110224	110215	110215	I	0	“ All those tailored suits . ”
110225	110239	110240	110240	Sara	100	“ Exactly . And that still averages to like , once a year , ”
110244	110276	110277	110277	She	100	“ Yet in the past eight texts and two minutes of conversation with me you ’ve dropped ‘ crazy hot ’ at least three times and there was also mention of … ”
110287	110320	110321	110321	I	0	“ ‘ Pecs the size of my face . ’ So … maybe all this is a sign ? I mean it really feels like God ’s dropping some major hints tonight . ”
110336	110371	110321	110321	I	0	“ First off , leave God out of this mess . Second , getting back into the dating game and having sex with my womanizing prick of a neighbor are two very different things . ”
110372	110382	110277	110277	She	100	“ How do you know he ’s a womanizer ? ”
110383	110398	110277	110277	She	100	“ I looked at him , Sara . And then I heard him talk . ”
110399	110410	110321	110321	I	0	“ Maybe he ’s not as bad as you think . ”
110411	110433	110277	110277	She	100	“ I think I ’m going to spend the next month listening to him take a new girl home every night . ”
110434	110461	110277	110277	She	100	“ Because you ’re a pessimist when it comes to men and relationships and all that jazz . But you are attracted to him , right ? ”
110462	110465	110466	110466	I	0	“ Physically . ”
110476	110533	110466	110466	I	0	“ But I feel like I had no choice in the matter . He ’s like … aggressively good - looking . I swear every single muscle on his body is an attention whore . They keep flexing and rippling when all he ’s doing is standing there and crossing his arms . It ’s stupid . ”
110534	110541	110542	110542	Sara	100	“ Well , it still counts , ”
110545	110580	110542	110542	Sara	100	“ So I say try and end this night on a positive note . I mean if he ’s related to Tess , there ’s got ta be a nice guy somewhere under there . ”
110581	110589	110466	110466	I	0	“ I would n’t count on it . ”
110590	110634	110635	110635	Sara	100	“ Well , I would . Matter of fact – I ’ll bet you your cab ride that if you stick around and talk it out with him , you ’ll find there ’s actually a decent person under all that sexy muscle , ”
110642	110663	110635	110635	Sara	100	“ It beats hating your home life for the next four weeks , right ? You know I ’m right . ”
110664	110687	110688	110688	I	0	“ Yeah , yeah , fair enough . I ’m calling a car in about five , okay ? See you soon , ”
110752	110757	110758	110758	I	0	“ What the fuck ? ”
110867	110875	110853	110853	his	102	“ I told you not to come . ”
110876	110896	110853	110853	his	102	“ You also told me you would n’t open the door if I did , yet here we are . ”
110897	110903	110853	110853	his	102	“ Noelle , go home . ”
110904	110947	110853	110853	his	102	“ But Nadia and I wanted to give you a housewarming gift . She ’ll be here in a couple minutes – and she ’ll be wearing your favorite little red thing . You always prefer us in matching colors , right ? ”
111016	111019	110999	110999	I	0	“ Lukie … ”
111020	111036	111059	111059	her	1943	“ This is not a drill , Noelle . I need you to go home . ”
111037	111050	111051	111052	the woman	1943	“ What the fuck , Lukas . Do not embarrass me tonight , ”
111062	111092	111093	111093	she	1943	“ I need your cock now . I ’ve been wet for you all day and we might as well take advantage of poor Tessie being gone , right ? ”
111097	111112	111093	111093	she	1943	“ You know how much she whines and bitches when you fuck her friends . ”
111130	111133	111134	111134	he	102	“ Goodnight , ”
111150	111153	111141	111141	She	1943	“ Lukas – ”
111154	111160	111161	111161	he	102	“ I have someone over , ”
111183	111200	111201	111201	she	208	“ Well … if I do n’t hear her she must not be very much fun , ”
111204	111224	111201	111201	she	208	“ And if you have n’t taken your dick out yet , she must not be all that cute . ”
111231	111254	111255	111255	he	102	“ Oh , but she ’s actually one of those rare finds that pulls off cute and sexy at the same time , ”
111267	111300	111301	111301	he	102	“ And trust me , my cock ’s been hard as a rock since the second I laid eyes on her tonight but I ’m trying out the gentleman thing for once , ”
111310	111343	111301	111301	he	102	“ That enough detail for you to head home now or would you like to hear about how fucking perfect her tits are ? ‘ Cause I could go on and on . ”
111424	111432	111411	111411	He	102	“ Something tells me you ’re displeased . ”
111447	111477	111441	111441	I	0	“ Yeah – sorry I ’m not completely charmed that you went into pretend - detail about having sex with me just to get rid of some poor girl . ”
111478	111518	111437	111437	his	102	“ Poor girl she is not , but do enlighten me on how I went into detail about having sex with you . If I recall correctly , I admitted to my dick being in my pants all night . ”
111519	111536	111537	111537	I	0	“ Well , I did n’t need to hear you talk so explicitly about everything else , ”
111540	111546	111537	111537	I	0	“ What did I say ? ”
111552	111570	111547	111547	I	0	“ I ’m not going to repeat it just so you can hear me say bad words . ”
111571	111583	111597	111597	him	1793	“ ‘ Bad words ’ ? What are we , five ? ”
111584	111587	111588	111588	I	0	“ Fine . ”
111599	111617	111588	111588	I	0	“ I did n’t need to hear all about how hard you were or how … how … ”
111627	111636	111618	111618	His	1793	“ How perfect I think your tits are ? ”
111637	111642	111643	111643	I	0	“ Oh my God , ”
